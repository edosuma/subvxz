WEBVTT

00:00.276 --> 00:02.401
The victim is a Lynn Dewhurst.

00:02.403 --> 00:04.870
We are now looking at
a serial offender.

00:07.026 --> 00:08.105
Clare?

00:08.106 --> 00:10.546
Do you remember Neil Ackroyd?
We were at school together.

00:10.548 --> 00:12.506
We've not seen each other
since fifth form.

00:12.508 --> 00:16.908
Lynn Dewhurst... Whoever did it
raped her with a broken bottle
and mutilated her.

00:16.910 --> 00:19.574
Now, they're accusing me of strangling
and bottling Lynn Dewhurst.

00:19.576 --> 00:21.720
How do you know I'm not going to
make life difficult for you?

00:21.722 --> 00:24.891
- What do you want?
- £1,000 a month.
- I can't, Vicky!

00:24.893 --> 00:27.430
She's ruined my life.
She's untouchable.

00:50.950 --> 00:53.510
Right, take your seatbelt off.
We're here.

01:01.150 --> 01:02.470
Here.

01:04.670 --> 01:06.909
Just along here.

01:06.910 --> 01:09.109
So you told him?
You could have just said nothing.

01:09.110 --> 01:11.669
- He kept on at me, he kept asking.
- And did you tell him the rest?

01:11.670 --> 01:13.789
"And she used to shoot crap
up her veins" as well?

01:13.790 --> 01:15.229
No, of course I didn't!

01:15.230 --> 01:18.829
You know he's going to go
repeating that at school?

01:18.830 --> 01:20.229
This is Ilinka.

01:20.230 --> 01:22.029
Ilinka, this is Daniel.

01:22.030 --> 01:23.309
Say hello.

01:23.310 --> 01:24.629
Hello.

01:24.630 --> 01:27.229
- And this is Clare.
- Hello.

01:27.230 --> 01:29.349
Sit down. Sit.

01:29.350 --> 01:31.589
She doesn't speak any English, so...

01:31.590 --> 01:34.469
- Tea. Do you want any tea?
- I've just boiled the kettle.

01:34.470 --> 01:35.870
Great.

01:39.750 --> 01:41.269
Some tea?

01:41.270 --> 01:43.469
Jako ste ljubazni.

01:43.470 --> 01:48.629
OK, yeah. So, Ilinka came into our
nick this morning - try and smile -

01:48.630 --> 01:52.029
and she'd escaped from
a house up Peveril Lane,

01:52.030 --> 01:53.669
where she was being kept prisoner,

01:53.670 --> 01:56.869
along with 21 other women who've
been trafficked from Croatia.

01:56.870 --> 01:58.069
You're kidding?

01:58.070 --> 02:01.029
She's been shunted from one house
to another for over four years.

02:01.030 --> 02:03.229
Eight of them in every room
at this last place.

02:03.230 --> 02:07.309
She's been doing a ten-hour shift
six days a week for £10 a week

02:07.310 --> 02:09.669
at Bowen's biscuit factory
up Rastrick.

02:09.669 --> 02:12.069
- That's...
- Slavery, yeah.

02:12.070 --> 02:15.469
Anyway, I got an interpreter on
the phone - that took three weeks -

02:15.470 --> 02:18.589
then I got the OSU, spoke to
the trafficking unit in Sheffield

02:18.590 --> 02:20.429
and we busted them out, the women.

02:20.430 --> 02:22.629
The only trouble now
is housing them.

02:22.630 --> 02:26.109
Managed to get ten of them in at
a women's refuge in Huddersfield,

02:26.110 --> 02:29.189
six have gone to a hostel in Leeds
and five are at the Mission

02:29.190 --> 02:31.949
waiting for the council to
sort out their flights back home

02:31.950 --> 02:33.950
and Ilinka's going to stay with...

02:35.030 --> 02:38.669
Winnie? Hi, it's Catherine.
Do you want to come across?

02:38.670 --> 02:40.030
Yeah, she's here.

02:42.350 --> 02:44.749
I have indeed got the
kettle on, Winnie. Ta-ta.

02:44.750 --> 02:46.589
I always thought Winnie were Polish.

02:46.590 --> 02:48.750
She's Yugoslavian... as was.

02:58.710 --> 03:00.389
What's up?

03:00.390 --> 03:07.069
He has told our Ryan
that I... am an alcoholic.

03:07.070 --> 03:10.029
It wasn't so cut and dried as that,
as I have tried to explain.

03:10.030 --> 03:13.149
Nine years old, and he's telling him
stuff he never needed to know.

03:13.150 --> 03:17.669
He asked. He used the word
"alcoholic".

03:17.670 --> 03:20.389
- Did he?
- I didn't...

03:20.390 --> 03:22.749
- I didn't know what to say.
- When was this?

03:22.750 --> 03:26.670
Last week. It was when you were
at the hospice - when Helen died.

03:28.030 --> 03:30.149
Right, well, tell him
you misunderstood,

03:30.150 --> 03:32.349
you got the wrong end of the stick,
and she's not.

03:32.350 --> 03:34.509
But that's... That's lying.

03:34.510 --> 03:36.789
He'll think I'm someone
who makes stuff up.

03:36.790 --> 03:40.429
No, he'll think you're someone
who gets the wrong end of the stick.

03:40.430 --> 03:43.389
He's not daft. In fact,
he's the opposite of daft.

03:43.390 --> 03:45.909
He's very bright,
he's very perceptive.

03:45.910 --> 03:48.949
And he'll know straightaway that
I'm talking shite - sorry -

03:48.950 --> 03:51.749
and that'll just reinforce
the fact that she is...

03:51.750 --> 03:54.670
Was... an alcoholic.

03:55.870 --> 03:58.069
It's only me!

03:58.070 --> 04:00.149
Come on in, Winnie.

04:00.150 --> 04:01.510
Where is she?

04:03.270 --> 04:07.029
Oh, jadnice!
Sto ti se dogodilo?

04:07.030 --> 04:10.269
Moram razgovarati sa svojom
obitelji! Treba mi telefon.

04:10.270 --> 04:17.110
Da, mozete doci kod mene kuci
I koristiti moj telefon.

04:20.550 --> 04:22.709
Ova policajka je bila jako
ljubazna prema meni.

04:22.710 --> 04:24.869
And it is just for
two or three nights,

04:24.870 --> 04:27.629
till the trafficking unit sorts
something out. She knows that.

04:27.630 --> 04:29.549
She's saying you're very kind.

04:29.550 --> 04:34.670
Mi cemo se brinuti o tebi,
draga moja.

04:37.270 --> 04:39.389
And I am saying you're wonderful...

04:39.390 --> 04:41.909
as long as we all stay
on the right side of you,

04:41.910 --> 04:44.910
cos, if we don't,
you're a pain in the arse.

04:46.950 --> 04:49.710
Trouble Town
by Jake Bugg

05:17.070 --> 05:18.989
Light left on
in the bathroom, again.

05:18.990 --> 05:21.869
- His bedroom light on,
her bedroom light on.
- I'm going back up there!

05:21.870 --> 05:24.909
- You're not up there now.
Who's left that?
- He did.

05:24.910 --> 05:27.629
So what? I can't find my calculator.

05:27.630 --> 05:30.389
So don't pour so much cereal
if you're not going to eat it!

05:30.390 --> 05:32.709
It's all to pay for -
it doesn't grow on trees!

05:32.710 --> 05:34.589
He needs to calm down.

05:34.590 --> 05:36.709
I do not need to calm down!

05:36.710 --> 05:39.229
I need to not be surrounded
by people who take the p...

05:39.230 --> 05:41.110
Who take the mickey all the time.

05:42.990 --> 05:44.550
- See you.
- Yup.

05:47.030 --> 05:48.469
What's up with him?

05:48.470 --> 05:49.990
- God knows.
- Eh?

05:51.270 --> 05:55.029
It's this killer, it's this bloke
who's murdering prostitutes.

05:55.030 --> 05:57.709
They're tough jobs to work on,
I suppose. I don't know.

05:57.710 --> 05:59.390
No need to take it out on us.

06:07.150 --> 06:09.349
'In Calderdale
in West Yorkshire,

06:09.350 --> 06:12.429
'police chiefs have called for
increased vigilance in the community

06:12.430 --> 06:16.269
'following the linking of the murder
of three women in the area

06:16.270 --> 06:18.390
'over the last five months.'

06:32.830 --> 06:35.589
Catherine, you're not going on
the house-to-house, are you?

06:35.590 --> 06:36.949
No. That would be unethical,

06:36.950 --> 06:39.869
what, with me being
prime suspect, etc.
- Just checking.

06:39.870 --> 06:41.589
They're going on the house-to-house,

06:41.590 --> 06:43.469
so, unless you can find
any more staff,

06:43.470 --> 06:46.069
I'm going to arrest a 15-year-old
at Salter Hebble High

06:46.070 --> 06:49.150
for dealing skunk behind
the science block.
- OK, good.

06:53.430 --> 06:54.870
- Morning.
- Morning.

06:55.950 --> 06:57.270
Morning.

06:59.950 --> 07:01.229
Do you know how it's grown?

07:01.230 --> 07:03.109
You don't know and
you don't care, I know.

07:03.110 --> 07:04.349
I'm going to tell you anyway,

07:04.350 --> 07:06.789
because, you never know,
it might serve as a wake-up call.

07:06.790 --> 07:08.869
They find a terraced house,
rip everything out -

07:08.870 --> 07:11.389
including the bathroom,
all the fixtures and fittings -

07:11.390 --> 07:13.629
and fill the whole place
with cannabis plants.

07:13.630 --> 07:16.669
Then they employ a load of illegal
immigrants - well, I say "employ",

07:16.670 --> 07:19.509
I use the term loosely - to chuck
a load of seriously unpleasant

07:19.510 --> 07:22.429
illegal chemicals on them
to make them grow far too fast.

07:22.430 --> 07:23.789
And not only that...

07:23.790 --> 07:25.509
Once they've ripped
the bathroom out

07:25.510 --> 07:27.829
and there's nowhere to go
and do the necessary,

07:27.830 --> 07:29.829
they shit on the plants.

07:29.830 --> 07:31.789
No, they really do.

07:31.790 --> 07:34.029
That's what you're
dealing with here.

07:34.030 --> 07:35.989
That's what you've been handling.

07:35.990 --> 07:37.590
Human faeces.

07:41.350 --> 07:44.069
Get in, idiot.

07:44.070 --> 07:45.909
'Catherine?'

07:45.910 --> 07:47.189
Boss.

07:47.190 --> 07:48.829
You busy?

07:48.830 --> 07:50.109
No.

07:50.110 --> 07:53.589
OK. So, I've just heard,
and I thought you'd like to know -

07:53.590 --> 07:55.949
'the Home Office have

08:50.470 --> 08:54.189
Now, this morning,
I'm delighted to tell you

08:54.190 --> 08:58.189
that we have a new
member of staff joining us.

08:58.190 --> 09:04.109
Miss Wealand has come all the way
from Linlithgow in Scotland

09:04.110 --> 09:08.389
to take over from Mrs Etherington
as our new teaching assistant,

09:08.390 --> 09:11.829
and I'm sure you'd
all like to join me

09:11.830 --> 09:15.949
in giving her
a really big, warm welcome.

09:15.950 --> 09:18.629
One, two, three...

09:18.630 --> 09:22.509
Welcome to our school,
Miss Wealand!

09:22.510 --> 09:25.510
Thank you, I'm delighted to be here.

09:50.870 --> 09:52.669
Is that an approved technique?

09:52.670 --> 09:54.870
For getting people out of bed, yeah.

09:57.270 --> 09:58.750
Do you enjoy this job?

10:00.110 --> 10:03.390
- It's not all house-to-house.
- Only, you never look happy.

10:07.830 --> 10:11.029
If you had to lay your hands
on £1,000, just like that,

10:11.030 --> 10:14.509
what would you do?
- Ask me dad.
- What, and he'd just shell out?

10:14.510 --> 10:16.229
He's a millionaire, so...

10:16.230 --> 10:18.749
probably not.
- Your dad's a millionaire?

10:18.750 --> 10:20.549
He's, like, so rich it's boring.

10:20.550 --> 10:22.029
Wow.

10:22.030 --> 10:24.309
So, how does he feel
about you being a PCSO?

10:24.310 --> 10:25.709
Oh, you know.

10:25.710 --> 10:28.149
"Hundreds of millions of pounds
spent on her education

10:28.150 --> 10:30.429
"and she wants to be
a bloody policeman."

10:30.430 --> 10:32.830
Only not so polite.

10:34.150 --> 10:36.429
Why do you need £1,000?

10:36.430 --> 10:37.830
It's complicated.

10:43.230 --> 10:45.909
You're not exactly a barrel of
laughs yourself, you know, kid.

10:45.910 --> 10:48.670
Yeah, well, it's my mother's
funeral tomorrow.

10:50.590 --> 10:51.990
Is it?

10:53.030 --> 10:54.669
Oh, God. I'm sorry, I had no idea.

10:54.670 --> 10:57.469
- I haven't been advertising it.
- You shouldn't be at work, Ann.

10:57.470 --> 10:59.030
I'd go mad at home.

11:00.470 --> 11:01.869
Was it sudden?

11:01.870 --> 11:03.110
Cancer.

11:05.030 --> 11:07.950
I'm sorry. I am sorry.

11:15.950 --> 11:18.310
You could always buy
a lottery ticket.

11:47.430 --> 11:49.829
- You're joking.
- Nope.
- Sarge?
- Yup.
- How do you know?

11:49.830 --> 11:52.229
Gorkem read it on the box,
just before it got classified.

11:52.230 --> 11:54.749
She's been questioned cos
she left threatening messages

11:54.750 --> 11:57.309
on Lynn Dewhurst's answering
machine days before she died.

11:57.310 --> 11:59.549
That'll be why she's not
been on the house-to-house.

11:59.550 --> 12:02.989
- She can't do anything connected
to the murder inquiry.
- That's mad.
- It's stupid.

12:02.990 --> 12:04.309
Yeah, but is it? Lynn Dewhurst.

12:04.310 --> 12:08.429
So what? She strangled her and stuck
a broken bottle up her f... andango.

12:08.430 --> 12:11.749
I'm not saying she did it.
I'm just saying they questioned
her over a week ago,

12:11.750 --> 12:14.109
and she still isn't being given
any duties on the job.

12:14.110 --> 12:16.669
That's how she were the only
one off on that raid yesterday

12:16.670 --> 12:20.669
with the trafficking unit.
- What raid?
- Yesterday!
She tasered a bloke.
- Seriously?

12:20.670 --> 12:22.829
You people need to get your ears
glued to the ground better.

12:22.830 --> 12:26.269
- You tasered a bloke, Sarge?
- Er, food.

12:26.270 --> 12:28.949
I did, yeah. How much do I owe you?

12:28.950 --> 12:31.429
£2.25. What did it feel like?

12:31.430 --> 12:33.629
Good, yeah - given that, one minute,

12:33.630 --> 12:35.749
there's a bloke coming at you
with a baseball bat,

12:35.750 --> 12:38.669
and, the next, he's flat on the
floor, quivering like fucking jelly.

12:43.470 --> 12:45.749
Sarge, Sarge, Sarge!

12:45.750 --> 12:48.029
Get back! Get back!
Drop the bat!

12:48.030 --> 12:49.349
Taser, taser!

12:54.550 --> 12:56.709
Oh, shit.

13:03.070 --> 13:06.909
Obviously, I was trying to
shoot him in the chesticles,

13:06.910 --> 13:08.829
not in the family jewels.

13:08.830 --> 13:10.429
But you know...

13:10.430 --> 13:13.149
If you're going to wave a baseball
bat around in front of a woman

13:13.150 --> 13:15.149
who's just completed
her taser training,

13:15.150 --> 13:17.949
you're asking for
a bit of excitement.

13:17.950 --> 13:19.309
Careful, Ann!

13:19.310 --> 13:22.590
Sarge's got a bottle in her hand,
keep your legs together!

13:37.310 --> 13:38.949
Mr Tekeli...

13:38.950 --> 13:41.069
Perhaps you'd like to
take yourself outside

13:41.070 --> 13:43.869
and check the oil and water
in all the patrol vehicles.

13:43.870 --> 13:47.469
Oh, sorry. Were you in the
middle of your dinner? Bad luck.

13:47.470 --> 13:51.390
Perhaps you'd like to clean your
mouth out whilst you're down there.

13:54.790 --> 13:58.630
- Ann, can you step into my office,
love? I need a word with you.
- Yup.

14:01.990 --> 14:03.630
Chop chop!

14:04.830 --> 14:06.470
It were only a joke.

14:14.350 --> 14:17.270
Nobody in their right mind
thinks that you did that.

14:24.110 --> 14:26.829
The Home Office are letting
Tommy Lee Royce out

14:26.830 --> 14:28.470
for his mother's funeral...

14:30.110 --> 14:33.350
...which is tomorrow.

14:35.030 --> 14:37.909
Your FLO will be in touch to
tell you all this, but I heard,

14:37.910 --> 14:39.630
so I thought you ought to know.

14:41.150 --> 14:43.749
He'll be closely guarded,
there'll be an armed escort,

14:43.750 --> 14:45.349
he'll be handcuffed at all times.

14:45.350 --> 14:47.389
They'll have done
a full risk assessment

14:47.390 --> 14:50.149
and an operational order
will be in place.

14:50.150 --> 14:51.709
He'll be in, out,

14:51.710 --> 14:54.829
and straight back to the same
nasty little cell in Gravesend

14:54.830 --> 14:57.550
that he'll be occupying
for the next 500 years.

15:00.230 --> 15:01.829
Where?

15:01.830 --> 15:03.910
Where's his mother's funeral?

15:05.230 --> 15:06.630
Elland.

15:09.430 --> 15:10.789
Before...?

15:10.790 --> 15:13.270
No, it's after.
Later in the afternoon.

15:17.630 --> 15:19.390
- Right.
- You won't see him.

15:34.190 --> 15:35.909
I said I don't need any help.

15:35.910 --> 15:37.509
You do need help, love.

15:37.510 --> 15:40.189
You need all the help you can get
with your reading.

15:40.190 --> 15:43.549
I don't, not if I'm going
to play for Man City.

15:43.550 --> 15:46.069
I told her. I said...
I spelled it out for her.

15:46.070 --> 15:47.989
Did you, indeed?

15:47.990 --> 15:49.549
- Hiya.
- Hiya.

15:49.550 --> 15:51.949
- She talks funny, and all.
- Funny in what way?

15:51.950 --> 15:54.309
- She's Scottish.
- Who is?

15:54.310 --> 15:56.669
- His new TA.
- Miss Wealand.

15:56.670 --> 15:59.389
Well, it sounds to me like
she's trying to help you,

15:59.390 --> 16:01.149
so you just try and be nice to her.

16:01.150 --> 16:02.549
I hate reading.

16:02.550 --> 16:05.429
Winnie wants you, before you
start pouring yourself any tea.

16:05.430 --> 16:06.870
Don't do that, love.

16:16.070 --> 16:17.549
Only me, Winnie.

16:17.550 --> 16:21.949
- Here she is. Now, then, Catherine...
- Aww.

16:21.950 --> 16:24.429
- Thank you, Catherine.
- How's she been?

16:24.430 --> 16:26.469
She's been absolutely fine.

16:26.470 --> 16:29.149
Good, good. Did you want to see me?

16:29.150 --> 16:30.950
Look at this.

16:32.790 --> 16:36.589
To je Aurelijina odjeca.
Moja prijateljica Aurelija.

16:36.590 --> 16:39.669
- She had this friend, Aurelia.
- Aurelija Petrovic.

16:39.670 --> 16:42.829
They were shunted from one house
to another every few months

16:42.830 --> 16:47.709
by these people, these men, but they
always managed to stay together,

16:47.710 --> 16:51.309
her and Aurelia,
and they became very close.

16:51.310 --> 16:56.070
Aurelia, as well as working at
the biscuit factory, she... They...

16:57.590 --> 16:59.829
- They made her...
- Prostitution?

16:59.830 --> 17:02.549
Da. Then, one day,

17:02.550 --> 17:06.069
she thinks about
12 or 13 weeks since,

17:06.069 --> 17:08.469
she never came back,

17:08.470 --> 17:10.949
and she has not seen her since.

17:10.950 --> 17:14.388
And these - and she seems very
certain about this -

17:14.390 --> 17:15.989
are HER clothes.

17:15.990 --> 17:18.709
The girl they never identified.

17:18.710 --> 17:22.829
She says they didn't have
many clothes, any of them.

17:24.230 --> 17:26.589
- Aurelia?
- Petrovic.
- Petrovic.

17:26.589 --> 17:28.590
OK. Tell her...

17:30.550 --> 17:32.829
We're going to have to go
back down to the station

17:32.830 --> 17:35.910
and talk about this to the
team working on the murders.

17:37.230 --> 17:41.349
Catherine, zeli otici u
Sowerby Bridge s tobom njom

17:41.350 --> 17:46.389
I razgovarati o ovome sa ljudima
koji istrazuju ubojstvo.

17:46.390 --> 17:49.669
- Policijom?
- Da.
- Ne, ne, ne, ne.

17:49.670 --> 17:51.709
She does not want
to talk to the police.

17:51.710 --> 17:53.909
- Why?
- Knezenvici ce me ubiti.

17:53.910 --> 17:57.389
She says the Knezevics
will kill her.

17:57.390 --> 18:01.509
She's mentioned these
"Knezevics" more than once.

18:01.510 --> 18:04.189
How? How did she mention them?

18:04.190 --> 18:07.869
Well... Just as a threat.

18:07.870 --> 18:10.749
Did she see any of
the Knezevics? Ask her.

18:10.750 --> 18:14.109
Jeste li ikad vidjeli
neku od Knezevica?

18:14.110 --> 18:20.749
Ne, ne, ali jedan od njih je dolazio
u kucu ponekad spavati s Aureliajom.

18:20.750 --> 18:25.390
- What?
- One of them used to
come to the house, to...

18:27.910 --> 18:31.029
...do the business with Aurelia.

18:31.030 --> 18:33.429
But she never saw him.

18:33.430 --> 18:35.469
Who are they?

18:35.470 --> 18:37.709
The Halifax mafia.

18:37.710 --> 18:40.269
Of course it'd be the Knezevics
trafficking women.

18:40.270 --> 18:42.750
That'd be... right up their alley.

18:43.870 --> 18:46.550
Tell her... this is murder...

18:47.670 --> 18:49.989
...Knezevics or no Knezevics.

18:49.990 --> 18:53.949
In fact, good - anything
we can get on the Knezevics,

18:53.950 --> 18:55.270
we have to report it.

18:56.550 --> 18:58.350
We have to do it for Aurelia...

19:00.270 --> 19:02.150
...and we have to do it now.

19:07.390 --> 19:11.430
I don't know why they won't let me
sit in and translate for them.

19:13.230 --> 19:14.909
It's protocol, Winnie.

19:14.910 --> 19:17.150
They'll have me
written off as senile.

19:21.790 --> 19:23.989
Do you want me to take you home?

19:23.990 --> 19:25.709
No, no, no, no.

19:25.710 --> 19:27.549
No, no.

19:27.550 --> 19:30.029
I'll wait for her.

19:30.030 --> 19:31.630
Poor lass.

19:34.630 --> 19:39.590
How do they get into
a pickle like this?

19:42.870 --> 19:44.830
Do you really want to know?

19:46.630 --> 19:48.870
Now you'll think I'm senile.

19:51.390 --> 19:54.310
They promise them a better life,
and a job.

19:55.550 --> 19:58.989
Then, when they get here, they take
their passport and their papers,

19:58.990 --> 20:00.470
siphon off their wages...

20:01.790 --> 20:04.949
...tell them they're sending it
all home to their families,

20:04.950 --> 20:08.469
along with any letters they write -
which, of course, they aren't -

20:08.470 --> 20:11.589
and they don't know any better.

20:11.590 --> 20:13.389
The penny only drops months later,

20:13.390 --> 20:16.870
when they've never had any letters
back from their families.

20:18.190 --> 20:20.869
And then, when the penny does drop,

20:20.870 --> 20:23.629
there's very little
they can do about it...

20:23.630 --> 20:26.109
because the only people
they've had any contact with

20:26.110 --> 20:29.469
are the ones that trafficked them
in the first place, and each other.

20:29.470 --> 20:32.069
- It's evil.
- Yep.

20:32.070 --> 20:34.989
Well, if you know damned well
it's these Knezevics doing it,

20:34.990 --> 20:38.350
why don't you arrest them?
- Oh, Winnie...

20:40.430 --> 20:43.990
They're clever, clever... bastards.

20:46.670 --> 20:49.389
It's one thing knowing
somebody's done something.

20:49.390 --> 20:51.389
It's a different kettle of fish

20:51.390 --> 20:54.029
having the evidence
to arrest them for it.

20:54.030 --> 20:55.270
How...

20:57.070 --> 20:59.709
How did she escape?

20:59.710 --> 21:02.389
She was on a fag break from
Bowen's biscuit factory.

21:02.390 --> 21:06.589
Ilinka Morati mi pomoci!
Ako me uhvate ubiti ce me!

21:06.590 --> 21:08.709
Molim vas pomozite mi.

21:08.710 --> 21:10.029
Language line.

21:10.030 --> 21:11.429
'They don't run, normally,

21:11.430 --> 21:14.029
'because they've got
no idea where they are, '

21:14.030 --> 21:16.949
and they don't speak any English,
and they're terrified.

21:16.950 --> 21:19.589
So, effectively, they're trapped.

21:19.590 --> 21:23.389
All they know is where they live
and where they work.

21:23.390 --> 21:25.589
They're taken there and back
in a minibus every day.

21:25.590 --> 21:27.989
That's all they know.
That's their life.

21:27.990 --> 21:31.029
She got over the wall
and just ran and ran and ran.

21:31.030 --> 21:34.109
She'd got no idea
where she was going to,

21:34.110 --> 21:37.750
and, if they'd caught her, they'd
have beaten her black and blue.

21:40.270 --> 21:41.749
Sergeant Cawood.

21:41.750 --> 21:43.429
- Oh, is this Mrs Babic?
- Winnie.

21:43.430 --> 21:45.389
Andy Shepherd,
Detective Superintendent.

21:45.390 --> 21:46.949
We're very grateful to you, Winnie.

21:46.950 --> 21:49.389
This has opened up whole
new lines of inquiry for us.

21:49.390 --> 21:51.709
- I wanted to say thank you.
- It's my pleasure.

21:51.710 --> 21:53.230
Can I have a word?

22:01.590 --> 22:04.509
Ilinka's concerned that
she may have been followed -

22:04.510 --> 22:05.950
here, to the nick.

22:07.110 --> 22:08.749
- How, sir?
- I don't know,

22:08.750 --> 22:11.789
but you let her go outside for a
comfort break, yesterday afternoon?

22:11.790 --> 22:14.269
- Yeah.
- She thinks she saw a car,

22:14.270 --> 22:17.989
which disappeared as soon as whoever
it was driving it saw a uniform.

22:17.990 --> 22:19.429
- Really?
- Yeah.

22:19.430 --> 22:23.069
So, the concern is that,
if she's right,

22:23.070 --> 22:24.789
whoever it was may have followed you

22:24.790 --> 22:28.189
when you drove her back to
your house later in the day.

22:28.190 --> 22:30.589
- Oh, shit.
- Yup.

22:30.590 --> 22:33.389
But I'd have noticed, I'd have seen
if somebody had followed me.

22:33.390 --> 22:34.829
How sure can you be?

22:34.830 --> 22:37.109
It isn't as if you were
looking for it, is it?

22:37.110 --> 22:39.589
So, what you've gone and done,
inadvertently -

22:39.590 --> 22:42.429
and I'm sure with
the best of intentions...
- No...

22:42.430 --> 22:44.509
There was nowhere else to take her.

22:44.510 --> 22:45.989
Nowhere else had any space.

22:45.990 --> 22:48.549
What you've done is put
that little old lady in there

22:48.550 --> 22:51.069
in a potentially very vulnerable
and dangerous position.

22:51.070 --> 22:53.509
If it's who we think it is,
these people don't muck about.

22:53.510 --> 22:57.509
If they think Ilinka's told us
stuff that could compromise them -
and she has - they'll kill her.

22:57.510 --> 23:00.309
They'll put a petrol bomb through
the door, they'll do something.

23:00.310 --> 23:04.189
I've contacted the security people.
They're going to put a CP alarm
in Winnie's house.

23:04.190 --> 23:07.189
They're going over there right now,
they'll be there when you get back.

23:07.190 --> 23:10.109
I'm not going as far as
an Osman warning
I don't want to freak her out

23:10.110 --> 23:12.669
but perhaps you could explain
to Winnie what they're doing

23:12.670 --> 23:16.269
without causing her any more alarm
than we need to.
- Yeah.

23:16.270 --> 23:18.389
And do yourself a favour, Sergeant.

23:18.390 --> 23:22.349
Hurry up with your alibi for
either of the first two murders,
and then we can eliminate you.

23:22.350 --> 23:24.949
No-one is doing this to
embarrass you, Catherine.

23:24.950 --> 23:27.229
It's ticking boxes.
We all know it's ridiculous -

23:27.230 --> 23:30.509
you've got the QPM, you're
a credit to the police service.

23:30.510 --> 23:33.469
We all know you're not a killer.

23:33.470 --> 23:35.990
Please, just do it. OK?

23:37.150 --> 23:38.550
Sir.

23:41.310 --> 23:42.790
Oh, shit.

23:57.150 --> 23:58.510
You all right?

24:01.030 --> 24:02.830
- Dad?
- Yep.

24:06.590 --> 24:08.749
You coming downstairs?

24:08.750 --> 24:10.150
In a minute.

24:18.430 --> 24:20.069
People keep asking after you.

24:20.070 --> 24:21.430
Mm.

24:32.950 --> 24:35.670
- I wish we didn't have a full house.
- Yeah.

24:37.270 --> 24:38.630
Well...

24:40.990 --> 24:43.150
...they'll all be gone
after tomorrow.

24:45.030 --> 24:48.270
And then it'll be just you and me.

24:50.190 --> 24:52.349
I'm sorry we don't always
see eye to eye,

24:52.350 --> 24:54.070
because I do love you, you know?

24:55.510 --> 24:57.390
And I'm proud of you.

24:59.870 --> 25:01.390
I'm proud of you.

25:14.590 --> 25:18.149
I sacked this fella at work
the other day.

25:18.150 --> 25:19.989
It's been bothering me.

25:19.990 --> 25:21.989
- What did he do?
- Oh, he made a mistake

25:21.990 --> 25:25.229
and then he didn't handle it so well
and I had to pick up the pieces,

25:25.230 --> 25:27.069
so I gave him his marching orders.

25:27.070 --> 25:28.630
- So?
- So...

25:30.590 --> 25:35.109
So, your mother would have persuaded
me to give him another chance,

25:35.110 --> 25:37.190
even though he's had loads already.

25:39.270 --> 25:44.070
You see, she never gave up
on anyone, your mum.

25:46.830 --> 25:49.230
She never stopped seeing
the good in folk.

25:50.710 --> 25:54.310
It's Tommy Lee Royce's
mother's funeral tomorrow.

25:55.390 --> 25:57.150
They're letting him out.

25:58.910 --> 26:00.629
It's at Elland.

26:00.630 --> 26:02.269
I know.

26:02.270 --> 26:03.989
Alec rang.

26:03.990 --> 26:06.549
The Family Liaison Officer.

26:06.550 --> 26:09.909
I had to do house-to-house
on Bateman Street this morning.

26:09.910 --> 26:13.229
- Up King Cross.
- They should never
have made you go up that street.

26:13.230 --> 26:15.829
I'm not scared of that street.

26:15.830 --> 26:17.710
And I'm not scared of him.

26:19.310 --> 26:21.110
I'm not scared of anything.

26:23.270 --> 26:25.269
See you later. Goodnight.

26:25.270 --> 26:26.590
Drive safely.

26:29.470 --> 26:30.949
So, you know where I am.

26:30.950 --> 26:33.629
And I'll sleep in our conservatory
tonight, then I'm handy.

26:33.630 --> 26:35.669
Don't be so damned silly,
you'll freeze.

26:35.670 --> 26:37.389
Tell her to get some sleep.

26:37.390 --> 26:41.509
- Catherine kaze san.
- Not to worry...
- I ne brinite.
- ..about anything.

26:41.510 --> 26:44.029
I'll tell her, I'll tell her,
I'll tell her.

26:44.030 --> 26:45.549
I'm sorry about this.

26:45.550 --> 26:47.869
You get some sleep yourself, lady.

26:47.870 --> 26:50.709
- Night-night.
- Night-night.
- Lock this door.

26:50.710 --> 26:53.789
Oh, I thought
I might leave it wide open

26:53.790 --> 26:56.509
and put a sign out.
"Traffickers this way" (!)

26:56.510 --> 26:58.749
Oh, and an arrow.

26:58.750 --> 27:00.269
Boop.

27:00.270 --> 27:02.309
Yeah, OK. Night-night, Ilinka.

27:02.310 --> 27:03.670
Night-night.

27:04.710 --> 27:05.990
Night-night.

27:56.030 --> 27:57.430
Good morning.

27:58.990 --> 28:00.469
Morning, boss.

28:00.470 --> 28:02.589
I've come to let you know
you've been given

28:02.590 --> 28:06.230
permission by the Home Office
to attend your mother's funeral.

28:07.630 --> 28:09.549
- When?
- Today.

28:09.550 --> 28:11.469
You'll be leaving in half an hour.

28:11.470 --> 28:13.549
You'll be driven there
under armed escort.

28:13.550 --> 28:16.029
You'll be handcuffed at all times.
OK?

28:16.030 --> 28:18.549
You came straight here from court
after your conviction,

28:18.550 --> 28:20.949
so I'm assuming you've
got a suit of some sort?

28:20.950 --> 28:22.510
Yeah, yeah...

28:23.950 --> 28:26.429
- They took it off me...
- I've sorted that out.

28:26.430 --> 28:27.990
I'll leave it with you.

28:34.030 --> 28:35.350
You all right, son?

28:47.430 --> 28:49.309
Tea?

28:49.310 --> 28:50.630
Ooh...

28:58.870 --> 29:01.549
I got the note. Why?

29:01.550 --> 29:02.990
Oh, er...

29:04.230 --> 29:05.749
I didn't want to disturb you...

29:05.750 --> 29:08.109
No, I don't mean
"why did you leave a note?",

29:08.110 --> 29:11.350
- I mean "why are you sleeping
in the conservatory?"
- Oh.

29:12.670 --> 29:15.269
Winnie. We put an alarm
in her house last night,

29:15.270 --> 29:17.189
in case anybody unsavoury
followed Ilinka.

29:17.190 --> 29:21.709
So... I just thought
I'd keep an eye out.

29:21.710 --> 29:24.589
- You never knock off, do you?
- I shouldn't have brought her here.

29:24.590 --> 29:26.949
Well, I should, because
she needed to be somewhere,

29:26.950 --> 29:30.389
and I don't think
they did follow her, but...

29:30.390 --> 29:32.310
I was stupid not to think about it.

29:34.350 --> 29:36.269
He's gone -

29:36.270 --> 29:37.989
Neil.

29:37.990 --> 29:41.429
He starts his shift at the shop
at half past six.

29:41.430 --> 29:43.669
I had a really good chat
with him last night.

29:43.670 --> 29:46.429
Oh, is that what it was?

29:46.430 --> 29:47.709
I told him...

29:47.710 --> 29:49.150
I've got a bit of history.

29:50.790 --> 29:53.389
It turns out he does too.

29:53.390 --> 29:55.909
- I know.
- You know?

29:55.910 --> 29:58.389
A couple of drunk and incapables,
yeah. I PNC'd him.

29:58.390 --> 30:00.789
- I didn't think you were
supposed to do that.
- We're not.

30:00.790 --> 30:03.949
- Not for personal...
- It's a sackable offence.
Don't tell him.

30:03.950 --> 30:06.189
Why didn't you tell me
that you knew?

30:06.190 --> 30:08.990
I didn't know whether you'd
want to hear it or not.

30:10.990 --> 30:13.629
- When was this?
- Five or six years ago.

30:13.630 --> 30:16.710
You see, that's when
his marriage broke down.

30:17.710 --> 30:19.709
It sounded awful.

30:19.710 --> 30:25.069
He had a good... I mean, a really
good job at the building society.

30:25.070 --> 30:28.069
- And then he got involved
with this woman...
- Oh...

30:28.070 --> 30:31.429
Oh, and you're whiter
than white, aren't you?

30:31.430 --> 30:33.789
- Why did you PNC him?
- I don't know, instinct -

30:33.790 --> 30:38.349
the way he flinched when I took my
coat off and he saw my uniform.

30:38.350 --> 30:43.669
Anyway, it all got very unpleasant,
and she started making threats...

30:43.670 --> 30:45.309
Did she boil his bunny?

30:45.310 --> 30:48.869
I don't know,
but it all became known.

30:48.870 --> 30:53.949
She told his wife and his kids
and he had a breakdown.

30:53.950 --> 30:57.109
A proper, real deal,
nervous breakdown.

30:57.110 --> 30:58.949
He couldn't speak.

30:58.950 --> 31:04.069
He lost his family, his house, his
job, his self respect. Everything.

31:04.070 --> 31:07.350
So, he ended up drinking...

31:08.630 --> 31:11.629
...and that must be
when that happened,

31:11.630 --> 31:13.189
when he hit rock bottom.

31:13.190 --> 31:16.030
- Does he drink now?
- No.
- How do you know?
- He told me.

31:17.390 --> 31:20.349
He's a good person, Catherine.

31:20.350 --> 31:21.630
He always was.

31:23.670 --> 31:25.309
At the time of her death,

31:25.310 --> 31:29.909
Aurelia Petrovic was living at
58 Hibernia Street in Boothtown.

31:29.910 --> 31:32.670
She was, according to Ilinka,
34 years old.

31:33.670 --> 31:36.669
Ilinka also told us that she
came from a village called Ivanec

31:36.670 --> 31:39.749
in Northern Croatia, and that she
has a mother and a sister there.

31:39.750 --> 31:43.109
So, let's get hold of Europol.

31:43.110 --> 31:45.949
Their ground officers should be
able to help us trace her family.

31:45.950 --> 31:48.429
I want as much information
on the family as possible.

31:48.430 --> 31:51.389
When did they last have any contact
with Aurelia? I want detail.

31:51.390 --> 31:54.509
The Hibernia Street address has been
secured as a potential crime scene

31:54.510 --> 31:56.869
and CSI are en route.
Let's see what that throws up.

31:56.870 --> 31:59.269
Let's liaise with the ops room
for the Peveril Lane raid,

31:59.270 --> 32:02.349
because they should be
collating full profiles
on the women found there

32:02.350 --> 32:04.549
and this could be crucial
to our investigation.

32:04.550 --> 32:06.989
If Aurelia was trafficked,
I want to know when, who by,

32:06.990 --> 32:09.469
and what she's been doing
since she entered the UK.

32:09.470 --> 32:12.750
Who lived at 58 Hibernia Street?
Who visited? Who owns it?

32:14.670 --> 32:17.909
"I am not going...

32:17.910 --> 32:24.629
"to ask... you again, George...

32:24.630 --> 32:28.829
"said... Granny."

32:28.830 --> 32:32.629
My granny doesn't look like that,
like a little old woman.

32:32.630 --> 32:35.549
She'd know how to deal with
this George lad better, and all.

32:35.550 --> 32:38.869
- What does your granny look like?
- She's a policeman. Woman.

32:38.870 --> 32:40.429
Is she?

32:40.430 --> 32:43.270
She chases scrotes
and druggies and nutters.

32:44.430 --> 32:46.269
What about your other granny?

32:46.270 --> 32:49.629
- I haven't got another one.
- Your dad's mum.

32:49.630 --> 32:52.909
We don't talk about me dad.
And anyway...

32:52.910 --> 32:55.389
How did you know Granny
isn't me dad's mum?

32:55.390 --> 32:56.909
I didn't tell you that.

32:56.910 --> 33:00.229
Oh, I must've just made
a lucky guess there, Ryan.

33:00.230 --> 33:03.350
- Come on, bit more.
- Why are you all dressed up?

33:04.350 --> 33:08.510
- You're very good at diversion
tactics, aren't you?
- Am I?
- Mm-hmm.

33:09.630 --> 33:12.789
I'm dressed up because I'm going
to a funeral this afternoon.

33:12.790 --> 33:15.189
So is my granny -
and my Auntie Clare.

33:15.190 --> 33:17.069
Is she? Are they?

33:17.070 --> 33:20.069
I wanted to go as well so
I wouldn't have to come to school,

33:20.070 --> 33:22.389
but they wouldn't let me.

33:22.390 --> 33:25.309
- Did you know Helen as well, then?
- Helen?

33:25.310 --> 33:26.909
No.

33:26.910 --> 33:30.349
No, I'm going to
someone else's funeral.

33:30.350 --> 33:32.229
Whose?

33:32.230 --> 33:33.870
You didn't know her.

33:40.110 --> 33:42.869
I said, "Stop being
a push-over, you pillock.

33:42.870 --> 33:44.469
"You've got to take decisive action.

33:44.470 --> 33:46.709
"You can't let yourself
get bullied like this.

33:46.710 --> 33:49.749
"You're a copper, for God's sake -
a bloody good one and all".

33:51.390 --> 33:53.549
'I do realise I'm playing with fire,

33:53.550 --> 33:56.350
'with you being a policeman
and everything.'

34:04.510 --> 34:05.909
Hello?

34:05.910 --> 34:07.790
Hi. It's me.

34:09.510 --> 34:10.989
I've, er...

34:13.590 --> 34:15.149
You're right.

34:15.150 --> 34:18.029
You're right, I should leave her.
I should have left her years ago.

34:18.030 --> 34:21.829
So... I'm going to go round
this afternoon...

34:21.830 --> 34:24.309
Well, this evening, after work,

34:24.310 --> 34:29.309
and I'll get my stuff and...

34:29.310 --> 34:31.070
that's it, I'll tell her.

34:32.710 --> 34:35.869
Then I'll be round at yours.
Is that all right?

34:35.870 --> 34:38.149
Well... yeah.

34:38.150 --> 34:39.909
Yeah, yeah, of course.

34:41.590 --> 34:44.509
- Great.
- Well, you must feel relieved,

34:44.510 --> 34:47.389
now you've made that decision.
- Yeah, yeah, I do.

34:49.389 --> 34:51.989
What time will I see you?
Shall we say half seven-ish?

34:51.989 --> 34:53.590
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

34:54.909 --> 34:56.389
I'll cook.

34:56.389 --> 34:59.109
Great, that's fine.

34:59.110 --> 35:01.309
Great.

35:01.310 --> 35:02.550
OK.

35:03.550 --> 35:05.070
Bye.

35:40.350 --> 35:44.110
There will be a memorial service,
a proper one, at the Minster.

35:46.950 --> 35:50.390
Got the date sorted on that.
That's all.

35:53.190 --> 35:57.189
Mr Gallagher.
Sorry, Nev, to interrupt.

35:57.190 --> 35:59.910
I just wanted to say how sorry I am.

36:01.190 --> 36:03.189
I tried to catch your eye
at the crem,

36:03.190 --> 36:05.469
but obviously you had a lot
on your mind, and I realise

36:05.470 --> 36:08.349
you probably might not want me here,
but I just wanted to say sorry,

36:08.350 --> 36:10.070
again, about that other business.

36:12.270 --> 36:13.630
Sean...

36:15.990 --> 36:18.670
What am I going to do with you?
Eh, lad?

36:20.230 --> 36:22.349
Who's that?

36:22.350 --> 36:24.190
That is Sean...

36:25.950 --> 36:28.350
Somebody who works for Nev.

36:30.470 --> 36:32.229
He's been inside.

36:32.230 --> 36:35.109
He used to hang about at the
Mission just after he got out.

36:35.110 --> 36:37.149
Helen got him on
the straight and narrow

36:37.150 --> 36:39.269
and he's been working
for Nev ever since.

36:39.270 --> 36:40.910
Balmforth! Sean Balmforth.

36:44.270 --> 36:45.949
What?

36:45.950 --> 36:48.109
I was down Stoneyroyd Lane
a couple of days ago,

36:48.110 --> 36:50.989
warning the girls to be extra
vigilant with this bastard out there

36:50.990 --> 36:53.629
doing what he's doing, when
this van came creeping along.

36:53.630 --> 36:55.949
Then, when whoever it was
saw me, they sped off.

36:55.950 --> 36:58.869
So I PNC'd the vehicle, and that was
the name that came up as the owner -

36:58.870 --> 37:00.390
Sean Balmforth.

37:01.710 --> 37:04.269
You see, that were
the thing with Helen.

37:04.270 --> 37:07.349
Just occasionally, there'd be
someone come along, and you'd think,

37:07.350 --> 37:09.989
"I wouldn't touch that bastard
with a barge pole".

37:09.990 --> 37:13.390
But she never thought like that
about anyone, ever.

37:14.750 --> 37:16.269
- Look, I've got to go.
- Eh?

37:16.270 --> 37:19.269
I've stuff to do.
This is your crowd. You stay here.

37:19.270 --> 37:21.429
I'll pick you up later.

37:21.430 --> 37:23.309
OK if I take the car?

37:23.310 --> 37:26.830
- I don't actually know
that many people...
- Yes, you do. Liz is here.

37:28.270 --> 37:31.709
OK, but if I get bored,
I'll need picking up sooner.

37:31.710 --> 37:34.390
- I am coming back.
- I thought we were stopping.

37:35.870 --> 37:37.590
I'm just going to slip out.

39:42.870 --> 39:45.669
I am the resurrection and the life,
says the Lord.

39:45.670 --> 39:50.030
Those who believe in me,
even though they die, will live.

I know what you did!

42:39.550 --> 42:43.349
You're going to get what's coming

42:58.790 --> 43:00.510
Get off me, you bastards!

43:36.550 --> 43:39.309
- Hiya.
- Where are you?

43:39.310 --> 43:42.029
Nowhere. It's my day off.
Why, where are you?

43:42.030 --> 43:44.829
I do my best for you,
you know, Catherine.

43:44.830 --> 43:46.790
What the hell did you go there for?

43:48.550 --> 43:50.230
I don't know. To make sure.

43:51.390 --> 43:54.429
- What?!
- I don't know.

43:54.430 --> 43:56.869
Right. Well, I've just had
my arse kicked by the Super

43:56.870 --> 43:58.869
for not explaining
to you beforehand...

43:58.870 --> 44:01.309
if you were so much as thinking
of turning up there today,

44:01.310 --> 44:03.749
it would be considered
grossly inappropriate.

44:03.750 --> 44:05.709
Yeah, piss off, whatever.

44:05.710 --> 44:07.709
Also... Are you listening?

44:07.710 --> 44:09.749
Also, you've still not
alibied yourself,

44:09.750 --> 44:12.269
and turning up there
at the victim's funeral

44:12.270 --> 44:15.229
has not helped your case
one jot, one iota,

44:15.230 --> 44:16.989
one tiny little bit.

44:16.990 --> 44:18.549
I haven't got a case.

44:18.550 --> 44:22.029
This is really serious, Catherine.
You have got a case to answer!

44:22.030 --> 44:25.149
You found the body,
you made threatening phone calls,

44:25.150 --> 44:28.229
you had a motive, and now you've
turned up at the victim's funeral!

44:28.230 --> 44:30.349
- What motive?
- Revenge -

44:30.350 --> 44:31.830
against Tommy Lee Royce.

44:33.710 --> 44:37.590
You've demonstrated very, very
poor judgment going there today.

44:39.750 --> 44:41.349
Catherine?

44:41.350 --> 44:42.949
Yeah, I'm still here.

44:42.950 --> 44:46.429
Right, well, stop pissing about
and get yourself eliminated.

44:46.430 --> 44:48.590
I can't. I've checked everything.

44:49.590 --> 44:52.069
My calendar, my pocket book,
my smartphone,

44:52.070 --> 44:53.790
the roster, everything.

44:54.870 --> 44:56.470
There's nothing.

44:57.470 --> 44:59.229
I wasn't doing anything with anybody

44:59.230 --> 45:02.349
who can give me an alibi
on those days, so...

45:02.350 --> 45:05.430
I mean, I probably was, but
I've no record of it, all right?

45:06.990 --> 45:08.550
Boss?

45:09.950 --> 45:11.310
Mike?

45:30.590 --> 45:32.150
Hey, Dad.

45:36.030 --> 45:39.270
- You can have an apple and that's it, OK?
- Oh, you're back!

45:40.550 --> 45:43.949
I've been called out on obs.
We're following a suspect.

45:43.950 --> 45:46.150
Oh, right. How are you feeling?

45:48.110 --> 45:49.550
Yeah, I'm fine.

45:51.070 --> 45:53.189
It might be two days.
Hopefully not.

45:53.190 --> 45:55.829
If it's going to be any longer
than that, I'll let you know.

45:55.830 --> 45:58.669
- You need to catch this bastard.
- Yeah, we will.

45:58.670 --> 46:01.270
- Right, see you.
- Bye.
- Ta-ta.

46:03.670 --> 46:05.309
Where's he going?

46:05.310 --> 46:07.150
Work. Always work.

46:37.630 --> 46:40.909
So, how's this going to work?

46:40.910 --> 46:43.829
I mean, I have to be frank -

46:43.830 --> 46:47.229
I don't feel much like
being intimate...

46:47.230 --> 46:51.350
with the threat of those pictures of
me out there somewhere in the ether.

46:53.630 --> 46:55.709
So, what did she say?

46:55.710 --> 46:57.590
Amanda, when you told her.

46:59.110 --> 47:01.669
She said she knew.
She said she'd known for a while -

47:01.670 --> 47:03.269
well, suspected.

47:03.270 --> 47:07.070
- Did she want to know who I was?
- Yeah.
- Did you tell her?
- No.

47:09.870 --> 47:13.269
I know you're worried about the
children, but we can make it work.

47:13.270 --> 47:15.069
You can bring them here.

47:15.070 --> 47:19.189
- There's not room.
- Yeah, obviously.

47:19.190 --> 47:22.069
We'd have to get somewhere bigger.

47:22.070 --> 47:23.670
At some point, yeah.

47:26.790 --> 47:30.029
You will have to give me the phone,
and anywhere you've backed them up.

47:30.030 --> 47:33.349
I mean, we have to have
that trust back. Don't we?

47:33.350 --> 47:34.950
Well, I have to.

47:36.790 --> 47:38.270
So, she didn't go mad?

47:39.430 --> 47:42.790
- She didn't make a big scene
in front of the kids?
- No.

47:45.750 --> 47:47.150
I wonder why...

47:49.390 --> 47:52.989
Maybe it hadn't sunk in yet.
I don't know.

47:52.990 --> 47:56.749
Maybe she didn't want to make
a scene in front of them.

47:56.750 --> 47:59.550
- She didn't follow you, did she?
- I doubt it.

48:06.670 --> 48:08.430
I made a moussaka.

48:25.630 --> 48:27.350
There you go.

49:01.950 --> 49:04.029
You snuck off.

49:04.030 --> 49:06.789
I had things to do. Is Clare about?

49:06.790 --> 49:08.629
I think they're in the garden.

49:08.630 --> 49:11.630
Her and Ann. I think
they're having a cigarette.

49:13.270 --> 49:14.469
She thinks...

49:14.470 --> 49:18.069
..I don't know she smokes.

49:18.070 --> 49:21.710
Ann, not Clare. I know she smokes.

49:38.990 --> 49:40.949
Clare?

49:40.950 --> 49:42.589
Oh, shit, she's here.

49:42.590 --> 49:45.189
- Evenin', all.
- Finally.

49:45.190 --> 49:46.749
What's going on? What are you doing?

49:46.750 --> 49:51.309
It's OK, calm down. I just... I just
needed something to blur the edges.

49:51.310 --> 49:53.749
Anyway, where did you
disappear off to?

49:53.750 --> 49:55.309
How much has she had to drink?

49:55.310 --> 49:58.149
- I don't know, I haven't been counting.
- Don't start.

49:58.150 --> 50:02.469
- Don't start?
- She's allowed a drink, it's a funeral.

50:02.470 --> 50:04.269
Do you want to get in the car?

50:04.270 --> 50:06.629
Eh, come on, Catherine,
she's not 15.

50:06.630 --> 50:09.869
Yeah, come on, Catherine.
No, no, no, no, no, no...

50:09.870 --> 50:12.389
- Put it down.
- I don't need it.
- Good. Put it down.

50:12.390 --> 50:14.269
Why don't you chill?

50:14.270 --> 50:16.829
Today of all days,
to fall off the wagon.

50:16.830 --> 50:18.909
Helen would've been
really proud of you.

50:18.910 --> 50:21.709
Don't throw that out at me.
That's below the belt, that is.

50:21.710 --> 50:24.229
Right, well,
what would she have said?

50:24.230 --> 50:27.229
- Come on, put it down.
- I've been very upset today.

50:27.230 --> 50:28.749
I know you've been upset,

50:28.750 --> 50:31.389
but you can make the right decision,
right now,

50:31.390 --> 50:33.829
not to let this go any further.
When did she start?

50:33.830 --> 50:37.029
Can we not talk to me
like I'm about six, please,

50:37.030 --> 50:38.589
or not even present?

50:38.590 --> 50:41.269
- Clare's an alcoholic.
- I didn't know that.

50:41.270 --> 50:44.469
- That's right, go on, embarrass me.
- When did she start?

50:44.470 --> 50:46.789
- She's not had tonnes.
- Who's "she"? The cat's mother?

50:46.790 --> 50:48.989
I don't want to embarrass you,
Clare, I just want you

50:48.990 --> 50:51.549
to not let this go any further
than it has done already.

50:51.550 --> 50:55.349
I just want you to put that down
and I want you to get into the car.

50:55.350 --> 50:56.950
Please?

51:00.110 --> 51:02.669
Do you want me to treat you like
I'm your sister and I love you,

51:02.670 --> 51:04.989
or do you want me to treat you
like I'm a police officer?

51:04.990 --> 51:06.389
Which I will do, if I have to.

51:06.390 --> 51:08.829
- I've not done anything illegal.
- Yes.

51:08.830 --> 51:12.110
But, if you carry on, you and me
both know you probably will.

51:13.150 --> 51:14.590
Well...

51:16.670 --> 51:19.830
I need a wee before we go, anyway.

51:22.230 --> 51:23.790
Right.

51:34.790 --> 51:36.270
I'm sorry, Catherine.

51:37.270 --> 51:38.830
I had no idea.

51:41.110 --> 51:42.869
She'll go through your fridge,

51:42.870 --> 51:47.029
she'll be in your cupboards, finding
things to take home with her.

51:47.030 --> 51:48.910
Oh, fuck. Yeah. Here.

51:57.910 --> 52:02.309
Thing is, though, how do I know you
haven't backed it up somewhere else?

52:02.310 --> 52:03.950
Because I'm telling you.

52:06.310 --> 52:09.350
Anyway, it doesn't matter now,
does it?

52:10.390 --> 52:12.029
You're here.

52:12.030 --> 52:15.269
You made the decision to come here.
That's all that matters.

52:15.270 --> 52:18.549
Even if I had backed it up -
which I haven't -

52:18.550 --> 52:21.429
as long as you're here,
it wouldn't matter.

52:21.430 --> 52:23.109
What if I walked out?

52:23.110 --> 52:26.029
Would you suddenly remember that
you had backed it up somewhere?

52:26.030 --> 52:28.669
- Are you going to?
- No.

52:28.670 --> 52:30.190
Well, then...!

52:31.470 --> 52:33.469
- So, have you?
- Have I what?

52:33.470 --> 52:35.269
- Backed it up somewhere?
- No.

52:35.270 --> 52:37.149
Of course you have. I'm not stupid.

52:37.150 --> 52:41.590
I only used that phone to take the
photos and e-mail them to you, so...

52:43.310 --> 52:45.909
Well, yeah. Technically,

52:45.910 --> 52:48.989
I could've e-mailed them to
my own e-mail address as well -

52:48.990 --> 52:52.829
and any number of other people -
and backed them up.

52:52.830 --> 52:54.709
But I didn't.

52:54.710 --> 52:56.749
You're going to have
to trust me, John.

52:56.750 --> 52:59.989
- Trust you?!
- Yeah.

52:59.990 --> 53:04.749
You do realise... you could've
killed me with that bloody drug?

53:04.750 --> 53:08.269
Where did you get it?

53:08.270 --> 53:09.909
The internet.

53:09.910 --> 53:13.149
Cooked up in someone's back yard?
Full of shit?!

53:13.150 --> 53:15.509
I could be dead.

53:15.510 --> 53:18.029
- So I wish you had killed me.
- Look, we can either...

53:18.030 --> 53:21.909
Have you any idea of the misery I've
been through in the last ten days?

53:21.910 --> 53:25.509
Look, we can keep going over this,
or we can move on.

53:25.510 --> 53:27.789
I might need to
destroy your computer.

53:27.790 --> 53:29.789
You're not destroying my computer.

53:29.790 --> 53:32.309
- Did you send them to anyone else?
- No.

53:32.310 --> 53:33.749
Did you?

53:33.750 --> 53:35.230
No.

53:42.550 --> 53:43.630
Pudding?

54:05.590 --> 54:08.269
Stop it! Don't you dare
touch my things, you pig!

54:08.270 --> 54:09.669
Agh, you...

54:09.670 --> 54:10.830
bitch!

54:12.510 --> 54:14.110
You've had that coming!

54:17.430 --> 54:19.630
Calm down... Stop it.

54:22.550 --> 54:25.389
Get off! Calm down... Get off!

54:25.390 --> 54:27.110
You get off!

54:39.230 --> 54:41.189
Get off me!

54:41.190 --> 54:42.869
Get off me...!

54:42.870 --> 54:44.429
Get off me!

54:44.430 --> 54:46.669
Get off me! Get off!

54:46.670 --> 54:49.389
I'll scream. I'll scream, John!

54:49.390 --> 54:50.789
You're hurting me!

54:50.790 --> 54:53.510
You shouldn't have done it!

54:55.710 --> 54:59.709
You shouldn't have done it,
you shouldn't have done it!

55:02.990 --> 55:05.589
They didn't know that
she shouldn't drink.

55:05.590 --> 55:09.829
- What's she doing now?
- I've no idea, but at least she's in.

55:09.830 --> 55:12.389
Unless she's shinning
down the drainpipe.

55:16.110 --> 55:19.110
I'm going outside for a fag...

55:20.750 --> 55:24.270
...if that's all right
with the Gestapo?

55:41.670 --> 55:43.429
Where's she going to go?

55:43.430 --> 55:46.109
It's gone 11 o'clock -
she'll not get served anywhere.

55:46.110 --> 55:47.510
What's she doing?

55:52.910 --> 55:54.349
She's just lighting up.

55:54.350 --> 55:56.869
She'll go down the Jockey's.
They stay open all hours.

55:56.870 --> 55:58.750
I thought they closed that down.

56:00.750 --> 56:02.270
She's just smoking.

56:12.070 --> 56:13.230
Mum.

56:15.710 --> 56:19.150
- Clare?
- Fucking hell!
- Clare!
- Can you not leave me alone?

56:20.430 --> 56:23.869
- Where you going?
- I'm not going anywhere.

56:23.870 --> 56:26.669
- I'm coming with you.
- OK.

56:26.670 --> 56:29.869
- I know where you're going.
- Whatever.
- Don't do this.

56:29.870 --> 56:34.349
I need some space, I need for you
to stop pestering me, Catherine.

56:34.350 --> 56:36.349
- What about Neil?
- What about him?

56:36.350 --> 56:38.549
You see, this is
what it does to you -

56:38.550 --> 56:41.389
it makes you selfish and
small-minded and unpleasant,

56:41.390 --> 56:43.869
and that isn't you.
- You don't like him.

56:43.870 --> 56:46.429
- I never said that.
- You PNC'd him!
- Shh...!

56:46.430 --> 56:48.309
People don't need to say things,

56:48.310 --> 56:50.749
you can still tell
what they're thinking.

56:50.750 --> 56:54.589
Just one day - just for one day -
will you stop going on at me?!

56:54.590 --> 56:57.149
No, Clare, this is the day
I need to go on at you!

56:57.150 --> 57:00.349
Please. Please, don't do this.
I'm saying it because I love you.

57:00.350 --> 57:03.549
I'm begging you. I'll beg.
I'll beg. I'll do anything.

57:03.550 --> 57:06.549
I'll be fine.
Tomorrow, I'll start again.

57:06.550 --> 57:08.509
No, tomorrow,
you'll need another drink.

57:08.510 --> 57:11.069
- If you drink now,
you'll need more later...
- Will you shift?

57:11.070 --> 57:12.589
I'm sick of you!

57:12.590 --> 57:15.750
With all your holier-than-thou
police bollocks shit!

57:17.630 --> 57:22.149
If you go down to the Jockey's,
one thing will lead to another.

57:22.150 --> 57:23.709
You know what I'm talking about -

57:23.710 --> 57:26.349
there's nothing
you can't buy down there.

57:26.350 --> 57:28.669
You're not in charge of me,
Catherine!

57:28.670 --> 57:30.989
Just get out of my life! Go away.

57:33.990 --> 57:36.309
Right, well, that's it, then.

57:36.310 --> 57:38.629
The door will be locked
when you stagger back,

57:38.630 --> 57:41.389
and you can bang as loud as you
like. You'll not get back in.

57:41.390 --> 57:42.989
- OK.
- I'll leave all your belongings

57:42.990 --> 57:45.629
and your bits and pieces on the
street outside the front door.

57:45.630 --> 57:47.949
- Whatever.
- Oh, and remember -

57:47.950 --> 57:49.429
there's a fella out there

57:49.430 --> 57:51.389
murdering and mutilating
vulnerable women

57:51.390 --> 57:53.630
wandering about at night
on their own.

57:58.590 --> 57:59.950
Shit.
