02:13.628 --> 02:15.561
I got off work early.

02:15.563 --> 02:17.262
Lena's still at my mom's.

02:38.650 --> 02:40.983
94, 39, brabet.

02:46.422 --> 02:48.922

In addition, your honor,

02:50.258 --> 02:53.525
that the insurance
coverage has been cancelled

02:53.527 --> 02:55.593
due to Mr. Martini's
involvement with an arson

02:59.332 --> 03:03.199
this man lost his wife, lost his
house,

03:03.201 --> 03:05.000
lost everything.

03:05.002 --> 03:08.636
And not even single charge
was brought against him.

03:13.707 --> 03:17.709
We asking for a little
more time so Mr. Martini

03:17.711 --> 03:19.477
can get his life in order.

03:21.848 --> 03:23.981
At the bank's expense.

03:26.950 --> 03:28.283
Mr. Martini.

03:32.220 --> 03:34.521
Mr. Martini.

03:40.494 --> 03:42.360
I've never not paid anyone.

03:46.999 --> 03:49.065
I'll give you four weeks.

03:49.067 --> 03:51.233
If you could pay half of what
you owe,

03:51.235 --> 03:52.534
then I'll consider giving you
more time.

03:55.972 --> 03:58.038
Mr. Martini, do you have a job?

04:20.659 --> 04:21.591
It's still early.

04:25.329 --> 04:26.428

rent.

04:26.430 --> 04:27.328
Is it still available?

04:28.764 --> 04:30.396

07:08.493 --> 07:09.959

07:09.961 --> 07:11.894

07:44.587 --> 07:48.088
Hey, please don't stay out late?

07:50.925 --> 07:54.059

Okay?

08:03.498 --> 08:04.431
Okay.

08:05.534 --> 08:09.002
Coming to my bachelor
party tomorrow night?

08:10.038 --> 08:11.337
I don't think so.

08:37.058 --> 08:38.525
You owe me 150.

08:41.395 --> 08:42.528
I need it, I got problems, man.

08:43.864 --> 08:46.097
Getting married is not easy.

08:47.400 --> 08:48.532
For the last three months, man,

08:48.534 --> 08:49.866
and my problems are
much bigger than yours.

08:50.802 --> 08:52.034
I've got something cooking.

08:52.036 --> 08:54.469
Baku put me up on these crazy
dog fights.

08:54.471 --> 08:55.970
I could have made a g last
night,

08:55.972 --> 08:58.939
but I didn't have the
money to gamble with.

09:00.275 --> 09:02.141
Stop gambling, get a job,
and start paying your rent.

09:26.532 --> 09:28.266
I gotta talk to agroni, come on.

09:41.779 --> 09:43.746
Are you gonna come tomorrow, or
what?

09:45.048 --> 09:47.849
Come on, man, please, for
me, bro, you got the tools.

09:47.851 --> 09:48.783
I wanna pay you, I said.

09:52.520 --> 09:53.919
I told you I'll come tomorrow.

09:53.921 --> 09:55.720
Let me eat this fucking food,
man.

09:58.024 --> 10:01.692
This black tenant who's
working the system.

10:01.694 --> 10:03.060
Three months, didn't pay me.

10:09.767 --> 10:10.799
Sits here gambling all night,

10:10.801 --> 10:12.433
but doesn't have money for rent.

10:14.069 --> 10:16.602
You've got to fix this place up,

10:16.604 --> 10:18.036
then you get better people in.

10:18.038 --> 10:19.871
This is the way, man, I know.

10:26.078 --> 10:29.312
Agroni, give me a minute,
i want to talk to this guy.

10:47.828 --> 10:50.128
You know that.

11:02.940 --> 11:04.840
And you'd still owe me the
money.

11:26.262 --> 11:28.161
Give me a pack of reds too,
please.

11:40.673 --> 11:43.374
Just keep it, man, I figured it
out.

11:57.320 --> 11:58.719
Yo, rolexa.

12:00.855 --> 12:02.955
Rolexa, yo.

12:04.457 --> 12:05.123
Yo.

I've been calling you all day,
you can't call nobody back?

12:12.996 --> 12:14.396
You got a dog?

12:19.202 --> 12:20.968
I need the rent, okay?

12:20.970 --> 12:23.337
I'm giving you a warning.
This is the last time.

12:23.339 --> 12:25.472
I don't want to have to put
you out, but I need that rent.

13:20.726 --> 13:21.958
I thought you were sleeping.

13:26.764 --> 13:28.096
I miss my friends.

13:37.538 --> 13:38.704
I got you this.

13:42.075 --> 13:43.675
You're gonna go back to school.

14:09.266 --> 14:12.301
We gotta stop doing this, okay?
Here.

14:13.771 --> 14:16.304
Leave a message after the
beep, and I'll get back to you.

14:21.675 --> 14:23.575
I kind of had a good day today.

14:24.944 --> 14:26.877
I had a high score in Galactica.

14:29.580 --> 14:32.682
Daddy, want to talk to mommy?

14:39.188 --> 14:41.822
Anyway, I wanted to call you and
tell you,

14:43.324 --> 14:45.925
sweet dreams with the angels.

14:45.927 --> 14:48.594
Love you. Daddy does too.

14:48.596 --> 14:49.561
Good night.

15:02.506 --> 15:04.506
I mean like tomorrow or the next
day.

16:19.839 --> 16:21.339
Watch the car, man, hey, hey
hey.

16:21.341 --> 16:22.606
Watch the car, man.

16:38.254 --> 16:39.586
You gotta fix her toilet.

16:45.625 --> 16:46.691
You want a coffee?

17:04.473 --> 17:06.106
I fix lula's toilet now.

17:06.108 --> 17:08.108
Good seeing you, father gjonni.

18:13.204 --> 18:15.171
Okay look, I'm gonna go
talk to some renters,

18:15.173 --> 18:17.373
so just call for me
when you need me, okay?

18:29.482 --> 18:30.447
We're gonna talk about some
things.

18:32.484 --> 18:34.851
The Latin lovely ladies here.

18:34.853 --> 18:37.687
I got the turkish girls there,
the Lebanese girls there.

18:37.689 --> 18:39.455
I got it all going on, man.

18:39.457 --> 18:41.156
Oh, I got something for you too,
hold on,

18:41.158 --> 18:42.623
I forgot to give it to you.

18:45.493 --> 18:47.727
This is my new shit.

18:47.729 --> 18:50.529
This is my new shit, you're
gonna love this. Woo!

18:50.531 --> 18:51.796
Check it out.

18:53.532 --> 18:55.366
You gonna smoke with me?

18:57.069 --> 18:59.503
And how much power you
got coming down here, man?

19:02.673 --> 19:04.373
I increased it a little bit.

19:06.242 --> 19:08.509
Let's go smoke, you're asking
too many questions now.

19:16.117 --> 19:17.483
I'm telling you, man.

19:17.485 --> 19:19.818
You're the first person I'm
giving it to.

19:19.820 --> 19:20.752
Wait 'til you try it, man,

19:20.754 --> 19:22.186
you're gonna love it, love it,
love it.

19:25.289 --> 19:27.023
But we gotta come up with a
better number moving forward,

19:27.025 --> 19:28.257
to keep this shit going right,

19:28.259 --> 19:29.958
because I'm not fucking
with trading no more.

19:29.960 --> 19:31.826
I mean, it's not worth it to
trade.

19:33.496 --> 19:34.862
I gotta deal with this fucking
shit.

19:37.166 --> 19:38.832
And I want a small percentage of
the crop.

19:41.769 --> 19:43.569
C'mon, man, I got a
million things to do, bro.

19:46.973 --> 19:49.940
You can't do that, you can't
go back, I cleaned all this.

19:49.942 --> 19:52.309
A deal's a fucking deal, man,

19:52.311 --> 19:55.444
and now you're changing the
fucking...

19:59.349 --> 20:00.781
Everything's in my
name, I could, you know,

20:00.783 --> 20:02.749
lose the fucking building,
bro, it's a liability, man.

20:07.487 --> 20:09.787
And a nice unit upstairs for
600, that ain't shit, bro.

20:19.162 --> 20:21.562
One, two, three, four, five,
six.

20:21.564 --> 20:23.964
Yeah, okay, no more of this.
That's fine.

20:34.073 --> 20:36.240
I showed you my fucking porn,

20:36.242 --> 20:38.542
I taught you what 80s music was.

20:46.917 --> 20:48.250
What are you thinking about
going forward?

20:51.220 --> 20:53.654
And take this fucking picture
down, man.

20:53.656 --> 20:55.155
I'm not gonna tell you any more.

20:57.225 --> 20:58.791
It's fucking time for a
reelection.

21:00.393 --> 21:02.627
I'm voting for the fucking
underdog, man.

21:06.264 --> 21:09.098
Got no fucking friends
any more, but it's okay.

21:11.101 --> 21:12.601
I got you, girl.

21:25.078 --> 21:26.978
Fuck. Oh, I'm gonna come.

22:04.144 --> 22:05.210
You can do me a favor,

22:06.445 --> 22:09.713
tell leka to stop buying guns,
and start paying his rent.

22:09.715 --> 22:11.547
I'll see you, sweetie.

22:15.753 --> 22:17.285
Sorry about the delay,

22:17.287 --> 22:19.754
and, um, is it okay if I get a
receipt?

22:19.756 --> 22:22.823
It's no problem, man. The
place looks great, bro.

22:24.158 --> 22:26.826
Swear to god I've never seen it
this nice.

22:26.828 --> 22:28.661
It is the best I've ever seen
it.

22:28.663 --> 22:31.430
Could use two more guys
like him, eh, agroni?

22:33.634 --> 22:34.999
Hi, I'm Chad.

22:45.442 --> 22:46.808
We got a million things to do
today,

22:46.810 --> 22:49.343
man, I'm moving this
chick out down the hall.

22:49.345 --> 22:50.477
So Chad, yo, let me ask you,
man,

22:50.479 --> 22:53.146
like, why you guys moving
down here and shit?

22:55.316 --> 22:57.849
I mean, just like from the
suburbs.

22:59.452 --> 23:00.818
The neighborhood's cute, you
know,

23:00.820 --> 23:01.852
and it's different to what I'm
used to.

23:01.854 --> 23:04.921
So, you move in, you invest in
the area,

23:04.923 --> 23:06.989
you help it out and you build
something.

23:06.991 --> 23:08.156
Actually...

23:13.095 --> 23:14.328
All right, here you go,

23:14.330 --> 23:15.529
you know, you guys should stop
by.

23:15.531 --> 23:16.663
You should come by sometime, you

23:16.665 --> 23:18.264
um, you straight people are
allowed

23:18.266 --> 23:20.099

23:33.046 --> 23:33.944
Well, thanks, Chad, again, bro.

23:44.955 --> 23:47.288
We're going to dicks club, huh?

23:52.694 --> 23:56.529
Open it up, change the lock,
and I'll go check out Lena.

24:18.915 --> 24:20.315
What's up, len?

24:23.253 --> 24:24.819
If I finish, we will.

24:48.774 --> 24:52.576
I'll take fucking this,
these fucking DVDs.

25:19.432 --> 25:20.765
Hello?

25:21.967 --> 25:25.235
Oh, ed, what's up, buddy?

25:25.237 --> 25:26.436
Where's your mom?

25:30.541 --> 25:32.274
Is that a real gun?

25:42.151 --> 25:44.484
Because you're mom's money ain't
working.

25:44.486 --> 25:45.785
Are you thirsty or hungry?

25:48.923 --> 25:49.988
My cousin over here.

26:09.473 --> 26:11.339
But just go with my cousin,
he's a nice man, okay?

26:11.341 --> 26:12.440
We'll get you something to eat.

26:41.800 --> 26:43.199
Oh shit.

26:45.268 --> 26:46.434
Oh shit.

26:54.109 --> 26:56.243

26:56.245 --> 26:57.210
Thanks man, here.

27:02.816 --> 27:03.915

shit,

27:03.917 --> 27:04.949

seriously?

27:04.951 --> 27:06.016
Get back in the old country.

27:14.225 --> 27:15.123
I'm just helping them.

27:15.125 --> 27:16.657
Mind your fucking business, man.

27:33.406 --> 27:34.972
Did you see that?

27:42.779 --> 27:44.246
Later I could show you
everyone's apartment,

27:44.248 --> 27:45.847
on dad's other TV.

27:57.123 --> 27:59.324
Elvis!

27:59.326 --> 28:01.793
Elvis, open up the motherfucking
door.

28:01.795 --> 28:03.127
Elvis!

28:03.129 --> 28:06.663
Come on, nigga, quit playing,
I'll stab you, motherfucker!

28:08.033 --> 28:10.133
Here's your boy, he's
fed, thanks to my cousin.

28:16.541 --> 28:18.274
So get the fuck out of here,
and then we're through.

28:19.844 --> 28:24.111
No, it's my place. Here's
all your stuff, okay?

28:26.882 --> 28:29.349
What do you think, you're going
to play the squatting game?

28:29.351 --> 28:31.017
Sit around here for free just to
get by?

28:31.019 --> 28:32.184
Until the court system evicts
you?

28:35.122 --> 28:38.556
And how you leave your
boy alone all the time?

28:38.558 --> 28:39.456
Fucking call them!

28:47.696 --> 28:48.995
Okay, we'll see, nigga.

28:57.003 --> 28:57.968
To your balance, okay?

29:00.072 --> 29:01.171
That's what you just did.

29:01.173 --> 29:03.540
Motherfucker, come on. Piece of
shit...

29:07.745 --> 29:09.111
Just enjoy your day.

29:23.258 --> 29:24.290
Six.

29:56.921 --> 29:58.788
Yeah, I'm making a late mortgage
payment.

29:58.790 --> 30:00.623
Can you make sure it posts

31:44.183 --> 31:45.216
Say it to my face.

31:55.658 --> 31:58.825
And they fucking leave,
I'll fucking kill you.

31:58.827 --> 31:59.959
Get the fuck out of here.

32:01.328 --> 32:04.396
Get the fuck out of
here, you piece of shit!

32:04.398 --> 32:06.865
Don't let him bother
you. Is your friend okay?

32:09.302 --> 32:10.701
I'm calling the fucking cops.

32:17.075 --> 32:19.909
Ohh!

32:47.602 --> 32:51.069
Lena's still at my mom's so
maybe we could go out tonight?

32:52.438 --> 32:54.105
I'm gonna take a nap now.

32:54.107 --> 32:56.573
Wake me when you get home, okay?

32:57.575 --> 32:59.008
I love you, bye.

34:00.162 --> 34:01.495
Watch your hands, watch your
hands,

34:01.497 --> 34:03.396
here, I'll cut it for you, I'll
cut it for you, don't worry.

34:04.464 --> 34:06.164
So, that's kind of how it went,

34:06.166 --> 34:08.498
like, we'd have to blow in
the games to get 'em to work.

34:08.501 --> 34:10.333
Or stick him in the freezer.

34:21.275 --> 34:22.742
You know I hate it when you do
that.

34:28.949 --> 34:30.315
That have nothing to do
with what we're doing?

34:30.317 --> 34:31.449
You're always bugging me to
bring you here

34:31.451 --> 34:33.851
and now that I do, just never
mind, eat.

34:47.996 --> 34:49.931
Why do you think you
haven't been at school?

34:49.933 --> 34:51.264
Father gjonni...

34:54.303 --> 34:56.335
What the fuck is this now,
again?

34:57.538 --> 34:59.305
Hello?

35:05.979 --> 35:08.346
One of your renters friends, my
man.

35:14.719 --> 35:17.686
She have something that belong
to me.

35:17.688 --> 35:19.888
We gonna be by your spot
tonight.

35:26.362 --> 35:28.962
I can't talk to you about it,
but I'll tell you this much,

35:28.964 --> 35:30.396
that bitch owes me a lot of rent

35:30.398 --> 35:31.630
and I'm probably never gonna
have it.

35:31.632 --> 35:34.966
You're gonna have a big fucking
problem waiting for you.

35:34.968 --> 35:36.067
Hello?

36:18.469 --> 36:20.169
Daddy's gonna go have a
cigarette.

36:29.545 --> 36:32.013
Len, give me my knife, it's
really sharp,

36:32.015 --> 36:33.381

36:54.834 --> 36:56.567
Having some hot plans tonight,
huh?

37:19.183 --> 37:21.183
Checking all the pipes
in the whole building.

37:23.387 --> 37:25.353
I got some company.

37:30.524 --> 37:31.891
Hey, old man,

37:31.893 --> 37:33.659

not gonna have tonight.

37:33.661 --> 37:34.626
Ooh! Ooh!

38:50.826 --> 38:52.993
I hear it was fucking crazy.

38:54.062 --> 38:55.327
My daughter's getting home from
school.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.734
I'm getting sick of this
motherfucker.

40:08.722 --> 40:12.156
I'm so fucking high.

40:12.158 --> 40:13.957
So high...

40:19.862 --> 40:21.462
I gotta get to work, visie.

40:21.464 --> 40:23.997
Because my landlord's a fucking
asshole.

40:26.500 --> 40:31.068
If you help me, I could
pay you more for rent

40:32.737 --> 40:36.205
because now I can't afford
to hire an assistant.

40:42.878 --> 40:45.445
So we got our assistant right
here.

40:58.989 --> 41:00.723

42:47.108 --> 42:48.174

47:54.035 --> 47:55.968

My 10, 5 for interest,
10 for inconvenience.

48:03.609 --> 48:07.010
And you have her back in

Leave me the fuck alone.

52:02.401 --> 52:03.634
Hi.

52:15.079 --> 52:16.478
Is it still available?

52:19.816 --> 52:21.182
You know, I've been getting
calls for it all week,

52:21.184 --> 52:22.382

52:26.487 --> 52:28.420
I'll waive your first month's
rent.

52:28.422 --> 52:29.521
Just bring a security deposit,

52:29.523 --> 52:30.655

You still looking for a spot or

53:13.989 --> 53:15.655
I'm not charging the security
deposit,

53:15.657 --> 53:17.823
I'm not gonna check any credit,
it's a special we got going.

53:17.825 --> 53:19.758
If you could just bring
cash, that would be great.

53:23.629 --> 53:25.129
Can you get by at like, six?

53:26.164 --> 53:28.131

54:04.095 --> 54:05.328
Yeah, Ben, the building's safe.

54:05.330 --> 54:06.929
It's a very clean neighborhood,

54:06.931 --> 54:08.630
it's all old Polish ladies here.

54:12.067 --> 54:14.201

cash only. Just bring cash.

54:17.940 --> 54:19.172
Yeah, cash is cool.

54:19.174 --> 54:20.840
Just bring cash, and
that way if you like it,

54:20.842 --> 54:22.174

54:28.547 --> 54:30.247
You wanna come by and check it

55:23.429 --> 55:25.396

55:27.766 --> 55:29.298
You wait in the hallway if you

55:30.800 --> 55:32.400
So, just take a look around,

55:32.402 --> 55:34.068
if you have any questions,
just let me know, man.

55:42.176 --> 55:43.675
Shampoo it nice.

55:51.116 --> 55:51.982
I mean, it's just a good area,
man.

55:56.087 --> 55:58.088
Look, I really don't feel
like being here all day, man,

55:58.090 --> 56:01.658

guy, you were here first,

56:01.660 --> 56:04.093

56:07.431 --> 56:08.530
You brought that cash we talked

56:13.702 --> 56:15.968
Got the key right here.

56:15.970 --> 56:18.337
I ain't gonna count it, I trust
you, man.

56:18.339 --> 56:22.174
When we go outside, you know,

56:22.176 --> 56:25.110

56:25.112 --> 56:27.278

56:29.147 --> 56:30.547
How do you spell your last name?

56:30.549 --> 56:32.148
All right, Jamal, thanks

01:12:22.463 --> 01:12:23.728
Here's your money.

01:12:27.566 --> 01:12:30.901
All right, man, tell this
motherfucker to relax.

01:12:37.674 --> 01:12:38.874
I'm dino.

01:12:48.316 --> 01:12:51.918
I tell you what I am, a purist.

01:13:01.660 --> 01:13:03.894
Yo, man, tell your man to
fucking calm down, huh?

01:13:13.871 --> 01:13:15.770
They're better than us, you
know?

01:13:17.272 --> 01:13:20.440
They're cleaner, and they're
smarter, they're more loyal.

01:13:20.442 --> 01:13:24.510
Just depends who raised them.
Discipline.

01:13:26.946 --> 01:13:28.046
Teach them.

01:13:31.885 --> 01:13:33.084
Where's my girl, bro?

01:13:40.825 --> 01:13:43.558
Because I know I am improperly
bred to raise them correct.

01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:48.161
Like your tenant rolexa, huh?.

01:13:48.163 --> 01:13:50.897
The one you shit on all the
time?

01:13:50.899 --> 01:13:51.898
She's terrible mother.

01:13:54.168 --> 01:13:56.334
I took care of her son a couple
of times.

01:13:56.336 --> 01:13:58.435
It was your girl or something?

01:14:06.575 --> 01:14:08.208
She sucked dick for a living.

01:14:16.350 --> 01:14:17.982
She steals from me, you know.

01:14:20.151 --> 01:14:24.086
She had somebody steal from me.

01:14:24.088 --> 01:14:25.654
I kill her.

01:14:37.096 --> 01:14:41.466
My father, he's not very nice.

01:14:46.104 --> 01:14:49.039
It's healthy to suffer
sometimes, you know?

01:14:49.041 --> 01:14:51.408
To suffering is to cleansing.

01:14:53.010 --> 01:14:54.643
My children, they gotta suffer.

01:14:58.580 --> 01:15:00.947
They value when I feed
them that much more.

01:15:08.255 --> 01:15:10.922
I'm sorry. What are we gonna do
here?

01:15:10.924 --> 01:15:12.924
I'm gonna watch you eat or what?

01:15:51.056 --> 01:15:53.490
I bet you work hard for this,
huh?

01:16:00.064 --> 01:16:02.097
That's what we talk
about on the phone, huh?

01:16:03.934 --> 01:16:06.567
You got half there, you
follow me, you get the rest.

01:16:06.569 --> 01:16:07.301
Okay? And we're done.

01:16:16.443 --> 01:16:17.709
Dog,

01:16:18.977 --> 01:16:21.178
what do you think, huh?

01:16:21.180 --> 01:16:24.814
You think I'm one of
these dumb fucking tenants

01:16:24.816 --> 01:16:27.516
you fuck with all day?

01:16:31.821 --> 01:16:34.488
Let's just finish this,
that's all I wanna do.

01:16:41.628 --> 01:16:44.261
She louder, scratched harder
than a lot of little bitches

01:16:44.263 --> 01:16:46.896
I see before.

01:16:46.898 --> 01:16:48.831
You train her well, huh?

01:17:00.307 --> 01:17:02.207
Don't! Look at me!

01:17:06.646 --> 01:17:07.811
No!

01:17:12.616 --> 01:17:13.716
No! Daddy, no!

01:17:14.752 --> 01:17:16.218
The money's in the fucking
trunk!

01:17:16.220 --> 01:17:17.786
Dino, the money's in the trunk,
man,

01:17:17.788 --> 01:17:19.420
don't hurt my fucking daughter.

01:17:38.734 --> 01:17:42.668
Maybe we're gonna feed this
motherfucker's girl to Lucifer,

01:17:42.670 --> 01:17:44.403
make him watch.

01:17:44.405 --> 01:17:45.904
What do you think, Lucy, huh?

01:17:45.906 --> 01:17:47.772
It's been a long time since
you have some human meat,

01:17:47.774 --> 01:17:49.440
I'm sure, huh?

01:17:52.812 --> 01:17:55.479
She don't need to see this,
man, get her outta here, man,

01:17:55.481 --> 01:17:57.580
it's just between you
and me, you motherfucker.

01:18:01.284 --> 01:18:04.151
I bet you act like you're
Christ and shit to people, huh?

01:18:05.586 --> 01:18:07.253
Remember all that slick shit

01:18:07.255 --> 01:18:10.089
you was talking to me on
the phone, <i>shqiptar,</i> huh?

01:18:25.204 --> 01:18:27.805
To my dogs, I am their savior.

01:18:27.807 --> 01:18:30.340
I bet you wish you had
one right about now.

01:18:40.516 --> 01:18:42.049
G, let's go.

01:18:45.854 --> 01:18:48.253
Dino, please! Oh fuck!

01:18:50.122 --> 01:18:52.823
She doesn't need to see this
shit.

01:18:52.825 --> 01:18:54.558
Fuck you, man.

01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:58.327
Agh fuck! It's between me and
you, man.

01:18:58.329 --> 01:19:00.395
No, no, stop, stop.

01:19:00.397 --> 01:19:02.262
No, no, no, no, no.

01:19:04.498 --> 01:19:07.399
Dino, enough! Dino, enough!

01:19:21.046 --> 01:19:23.580
Agh. Dino, stop it!

01:19:23.582 --> 01:19:26.482
No, no, no, no.

01:19:33.490 --> 01:19:35.889
Agh shit!

01:19:39.927 --> 01:19:42.694
Go outside, check on them, okay?

01:19:42.696 --> 01:19:43.928
I'm gonna have some fun with
this.

01:19:53.269 --> 01:19:54.268
What do you want? You want this?

01:19:55.837 --> 01:19:58.504
Fucking take it and get out of
here!

01:19:58.506 --> 01:20:00.038
Okay, okay, okay.

01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:02.407
Dino, enough, okay, dino.

01:20:07.611 --> 01:20:09.411
Just like the sheep back home,

01:20:09.413 --> 01:20:13.181
we slice them, eat them well
done.

01:20:15.250 --> 01:20:18.085
You got a lot of good meat,
baby.

01:20:27.227 --> 01:20:29.026
You're gonna do nothing.

01:20:32.531 --> 01:20:34.597
And then fuck your bloody
corpse, okay?

01:21:11.064 --> 01:21:13.030
You like this huh?

01:21:39.989 --> 01:21:43.991
Argh! You sick motherfucker!

01:22:18.489 --> 01:22:20.823
Daddy. Daddy.

01:22:25.027 --> 01:22:26.761
I'm so sorry, okay.

01:22:50.016 --> 01:22:52.083
Hey, baby, come on, come on.

01:22:53.219 --> 01:22:55.219
And I'll get back to you.

01:23:03.426 --> 01:23:05.059
I kind of forgot what you
sounded like.

01:23:07.529 --> 01:23:08.762
I quit smoking.

01:23:12.199 --> 01:23:13.599
So, Lena says she wants
to make video games

01:23:13.601 --> 01:23:15.534
when she grows up.

01:23:15.536 --> 01:23:17.502
I know, that's crazy, right?

01:23:20.072 --> 01:23:25.109
She's getting so big, and
she's just like you, smart.

01:23:28.546 --> 01:23:30.280
And she just loves, and loves,
and loves.

01:23:33.751 --> 01:23:35.150
And I don't deserve it

01:23:37.620 --> 01:23:39.120
the way I never deserved you.

01:23:45.393 --> 01:23:46.760
I'm so sorry,

01:23:48.963 --> 01:23:51.296
I don't know
what's coming after this

01:23:53.198 --> 01:23:55.532
but I'm ready for it, you know?

01:23:59.870 --> 01:24:01.103
I'm trying.

01:24:02.772 --> 01:24:04.305
I'm trying so hard.

01:24:07.108 --> 01:24:11.411
I miss you more and more
every day.
