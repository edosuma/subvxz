00:05.000 --> 00:08.833
[Spyro laughing] Yes!

00:15.375 --> 00:18.792
[Eon] Skylanders,
your mission today is crucial.

00:19.458 --> 00:22.500
It is why we rely on a brave,
unrelenting team

00:22.583 --> 00:24.917
to guard our lands, our people,

00:25.000 --> 00:26.917
our very lives as we know them.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.292
Protecting my new bronzed beard monument!

00:30.375 --> 00:32.250
Who would attack a beard statue?

00:33.667 --> 00:35.250
[all grunting]

00:35.333 --> 00:38.625
Okay, I guess everybody wants to attack
a statue of a beard!

00:39.375 --> 00:41.542
Seriously, who throws lamps?

00:41.625 --> 00:45.125
They can throw whatever they want!
Nothing's gonna get past us!

00:50.833 --> 00:52.333
This is kind of easy-peasy!

00:52.417 --> 00:54.875
[grunting] Too easy-peasy!

00:54.958 --> 00:57.708
I'm gonna close my eyes
to challenge myself. [grunts]

01:04.333 --> 01:06.833
It's like we can see a threat
before it even happens!

01:06.917 --> 01:08.958
We are  en fuego!

01:09.042 --> 01:11.000
Well, at least a couple of us are.
Am I right, Eruptor?

01:11.083 --> 01:14.250
Oh, yeah!
It's us, right?

01:14.333 --> 01:15.792
[screaming]

01:18.250 --> 01:20.958
[Stealth Elf] Wow!
You took them all out, Pop!

01:21.042 --> 01:23.417
Hey, I was just aiming
at the annoying lamp dude,

01:23.500 --> 01:25.167
but I'll take it!

01:25.250 --> 01:27.292

like Bomb Shell

Come on, dude.
You gotta take this as serious as I do!

02:21.833 --> 02:24.500
You're an inventor science guy.
Can't you create some device

02:24.583 --> 02:26.583
that can stop bad stuff
before it happens?

02:27.250 --> 02:30.042
Fine, fine.
Waste your time playing with your junk.

02:30.125 --> 02:33.292
And speaking of jerks,
I'm going to keep my eyes peeled for some!

02:33.375 --> 02:34.583
You have a discerning eye, sir.

02:34.667 --> 02:36.750
That is a priceless
Skyruvian fertility bowl.

02:36.833 --> 02:40.333
Plated in gold,
aged more than 5,000 years.

02:40.417 --> 02:43.542
I want to use it
for my famous seven-layer dip. How much?

02:43.625 --> 02:44.875
[exclaims]

02:45.958 --> 02:47.583
[groans] Be right back, sir.

02:49.208 --> 02:50.583
Uh...

02:50.667 --> 02:52.375
There, just like new.

02:52.458 --> 02:54.000
Or old. Whatever.

-[Glumshanks panting]

02:58.917 --> 03:04.417
I thought... we agreed to meet
each other halfway if you needed me, sir.

03:04.500 --> 03:08.583
Yes, well, giving you false hope
is one of my favorite pastimes!

03:08.667 --> 03:12.000
Can you please stop blinding me with...
What is that anyway, some sort of lens?

03:12.083 --> 03:14.208
Not "some sort" of lens, Glummy.

03:14.292 --> 03:18.583
A magical one that I created
with my evil power!

03:18.667 --> 03:20.958
It allows me to see
into a person's future.

03:21.042 --> 03:25.000
All I have to do is point it at someone
and vio-lay!

03:25.083 --> 03:26.833
Televised destiny!

03:26.917 --> 03:28.250
That's a clever invention, sir.

03:28.333 --> 03:30.917
You could use that to plot
a successful attack on the Skylanders,

03:31.000 --> 03:33.167
because you'd see their every move
coming a mile away.

03:33.250 --> 03:34.833
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

03:34.917 --> 03:38.500
I'm using it to see my future
with the Golden Queen.

03:38.583 --> 03:41.167
But something's wrong with this thing
because every time I use it,

03:41.250 --> 03:43.500
all I see is my beloved
with other guys!

03:43.583 --> 03:47.708
Well, you enchanted it to see the future,
not adolescent pipe dreams.

03:47.792 --> 03:50.958
So may I once more suggest
using the lens on the Skylanders to--

03:51.042 --> 03:54.250
Annoy them with its glare?
Worth a shot, Glummy.

03:54.333 --> 03:57.417
Lens?
Painfully aggravate! [grunting]

04:02.125 --> 04:04.333
[slurps and sighs]

04:04.417 --> 04:06.583
Ugh! I can't even annoy Spyro!

04:06.667 --> 04:08.708
I just want it to slowly burn his eyes
out of his skull,

04:08.792 --> 04:11.875
but instead it makes his shade
of purple pop more vibrantly than ever!

04:11.958 --> 04:15.292
Useless. Now get rid of this hunk of junk
and go buy me a churro.

04:15.375 --> 04:20.208
Sir, we brought lots of yummy,
healthy snacks from home, remember?

04:20.291 --> 04:23.333
[whining] I don't want those snacks!
I want a churro!

04:23.417 --> 04:26.292
[yelling] Churro, churro, churro!

04:26.375 --> 04:29.083
Okay, you get one churro,

04:29.167 --> 04:31.292
then it's carrot sticks
and grapes, mister!

04:32.208 --> 04:33.708
Something I can help you find, sir?

04:33.792 --> 04:35.542
Yes! No...

04:35.625 --> 04:37.875
I have no idea.

04:37.958 --> 04:41.500
I'll know it when I see it!
I... think.

04:41.583 --> 04:43.958
Hey, don't I know you?

04:44.042 --> 04:45.417
Not in this hat, you don't.

04:45.500 --> 04:46.833
That's it!

04:46.917 --> 04:49.542
That's exactly what I think
I've been looking for!

04:49.625 --> 04:51.125
What do you want for it?

04:51.208 --> 04:54.333
Know what? It's your lucky day.
I'm giving it away for free.

04:54.417 --> 04:57.667
Wow! That's exactly how much I have!
Thanks, dude!

04:58.500 --> 05:00.208
Spyro, there you are!

05:00.292 --> 05:02.208
What if I told you I could invent a device

05:02.292 --> 05:05.083
that could stop evil acts
before they happen?

05:05.167 --> 05:07.417
A device that prevents future evil?

05:07.500 --> 05:09.625
I'd say, "You heard me
ask you the same thing

05:09.708 --> 05:11.542
a few minutes ago
because that was my idea."

05:11.625 --> 05:13.792
And it was a good idea, Spyro!

05:13.875 --> 05:16.250
Now I have everything I need
to build that invention,

05:16.333 --> 05:19.792
and we can stop all the evil
in Skylands once and for all!

05:19.875 --> 05:21.083
Sweet!

05:21.167 --> 05:23.750
Let's get back to the academy
and make this impossible dream

05:23.833 --> 05:26.042
-an improbable reality.
-Let's!

05:26.125 --> 05:28.167
So how long do you think it'll take
to make your invention?

05:28.250 --> 05:30.292
A machine this important
could take weeks.

05:30.375 --> 05:34.208
Maybe years.
Perhaps entire decades.

05:34.292 --> 05:38.667
Or... all of eight minutes
one leisurely afternoon.

05:38.750 --> 05:43.792
Just one last piece, and my quantum
evil-scope will be fully operational.

05:46.167 --> 05:47.458
So when you look through it,

05:47.542 --> 05:51.167
the evil-scope will detect
any evil in Skylands!

05:51.250 --> 05:53.792
-Me first, me first, me first!
-[Jet-Vac] How can we trust this thing?

05:53.875 --> 05:57.208
What, we're supposed to believe
that "science" can do the job

05:57.292 --> 05:59.500
of protecting Skylands
better than our eyes, ears, and--

05:59.583 --> 06:03.083
The evil-scope just detected Chompy Mage!
Hooray for science!

06:03.167 --> 06:04.667
What? Let me see.

06:04.750 --> 06:05.958
[Spyro grunts]

06:06.042 --> 06:08.042
[humming]

06:09.917 --> 06:12.292
Junk. Junk. Junk.

06:12.375 --> 06:15.958
[gasps] My tickets to the Chomper Bowl
are finally here!

06:16.042 --> 06:18.375
He's not doing anything
but checking his mail.

06:18.458 --> 06:20.000
Wait for it!

06:23.875 --> 06:25.125
I'll just explain it.

06:25.208 --> 06:29.042
The evil-scope not only shows us
where an evildoer is at any given moment,

06:29.125 --> 06:31.333
but also detects evil
that is going to happen.

06:31.917 --> 06:34.208
Evil that isn't even evil yet,
but will be.

06:34.292 --> 06:35.333
Unless we stop it.

06:35.417 --> 06:38.750
Which we will, because what could
possibly go wrong with that?

06:38.833 --> 06:40.250
[Spyro gasps] He's littering!

06:40.333 --> 06:42.708
Big whoop.
That's not so evil.

06:42.792 --> 06:45.417
Now Chompy's using the mail shreds
as kindling

06:45.500 --> 06:47.375
to set the Falling Forest on fire.

06:47.458 --> 06:48.917
Okay, evil-er.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.458
Look, there's just something
about using this thing

06:51.542 --> 06:54.417
that raises the question
of free will versus determinism

06:54.500 --> 06:56.417
that just doesn't sit quite right with me.

06:56.500 --> 06:58.208
Jet-Vac, save the brain drain for later.

06:58.292 --> 07:01.583
Right now, we gotta go stop that fire
before it actually happens!

07:01.667 --> 07:03.708
Let's go round up some more baddies.

07:06.083 --> 07:09.625
Gotcha! I wonder who else we'll find
through the evil-scope.

07:09.708 --> 07:13.167
Well, that's all I had
on the calendar for today.

07:13.250 --> 07:16.375
Busted, veg head, before you could do
anything truly heinous!

07:16.458 --> 07:18.500
Eh, seems fair.

07:18.583 --> 07:21.833
I was considering
a little grand theft auto later.

07:21.917 --> 07:23.625
[Pepper Jack humming]

07:25.417 --> 07:27.250

07:27.333 --> 07:31.292
[gasps] Hot sauce on waffles?
What kind of sick monster are you?

07:31.375 --> 07:33.458
I didn't even pour it on yet!

07:33.542 --> 07:37.542
But to answer your question,
I'm deeply troubled.

07:38.833 --> 07:40.125
Hey, play some Skynyrd, man!

07:40.208 --> 07:42.042
Hmm, don't know that one, dude.

07:42.125 --> 07:43.833
No? How 'bout the song,

07:43.917 --> 07:45.875
"The Skylanders Are Here To Bust You

07:45.958 --> 07:47.583
Before You Do Something
Way More Evil Later"?

07:47.667 --> 07:49.708
-Huh?
-You know that tune?

07:50.958 --> 07:53.250
[grunting]

07:53.750 --> 07:55.625
[grunts and groans]

07:59.375 --> 08:00.708
[Eon]  Stellar work, Skylanders!

08:00.792 --> 08:03.875
At this rate, I'll be able to retire early
and finally live full-time

08:03.958 --> 08:06.708
at my time-share
in the Radiant Isles Resort and Spa.

08:06.792 --> 08:08.875
Well, it's all thanks to Pop's evil-scope.

08:08.958 --> 08:10.917
Without it, we would've missed
all those threats today.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.875
Seriously, that thing rocks!

08:12.958 --> 08:16.250
And it made the day feel like
a fun montage of exceptional hero work.

08:16.333 --> 08:19.708
Indeed. And now that all things evil
are in the proverbial corner

08:19.792 --> 08:22.708
taking a proverbial time out
for the proverbial time being,

08:22.792 --> 08:25.333
you can all go home
and get some well-earned rest.

08:25.417 --> 08:26.625
-Proverbially.
-[Spyro] Rest?

08:26.708 --> 08:29.042
[scoffs] I'll rest when evil rests...

08:29.125 --> 08:31.000
in peace! [chuckles]

08:31.083 --> 08:32.332
I'm taking night patrol, guys.

08:32.417 --> 08:34.250
Seeing as how we don't fully know

08:34.332 --> 08:38.375
all the evil-scope's capabilities
or philosophical significance...

08:38.457 --> 08:39.667
Sounds good!

08:39.750 --> 08:41.832
So when we stop the evil
before it happens,

08:41.917 --> 08:45.250
where do you think
all the evil ends up going?

08:45.333 --> 08:47.458
[all laughing]

08:47.542 --> 08:49.792
Like evil is an actual thing.

08:49.875 --> 08:52.500
Or... or has a home, or friends,
or needs to eat.

08:52.583 --> 08:55.458
Or uses its super speed
to cut in front of lowly cadets

08:55.542 --> 08:57.000
in the food line at the mess hall.

08:57.083 --> 08:59.042
You never stop doing you, Eruptor.

-[Eruptor grunts]

09:15.625 --> 09:17.167
For a balanced breakfast!

09:17.750 --> 09:20.083
Oh. We thought you had
a new mission for us.

09:20.167 --> 09:22.750
No, no, I just really miss
saying the whole "unite" thing

09:22.833 --> 09:24.958
since all the evil
has been eliminated.

09:25.042 --> 09:26.708
You know, since we haven't had
any evil-busting to do

09:26.792 --> 09:28.958
with Spyro obsessively
doing it all for us,

09:29.042 --> 09:31.042
I finally did some traveling.

09:31.125 --> 09:32.833
I've already used up all my SkyMiles.

09:32.917 --> 09:36.042
Well, I took advantage
of our free time, too,

09:36.125 --> 09:39.417
and opened up my own
hot stone massage clinic.

09:39.500 --> 09:41.500
I've had ten appointments so far.

09:41.583 --> 09:44.750
And I've had time to get
ten hot stone massages!

09:44.833 --> 09:46.417
Oh, I'm so relaxed.

09:46.500 --> 09:47.792
[Jet-Vac] There he is!

09:47.875 --> 09:49.542
[Eruptor] Spy-guy!
[Stealth Elf] Pull up a seat, buddy!

09:49.625 --> 09:51.625
Good morning, Spyro.
Hope you got a good night's sleep

09:51.708 --> 09:54.708
after all the pre-evil busting you've done
these past few days.

09:54.792 --> 09:56.958
[scoffs] I was out stopping future evil...

09:57.042 --> 09:59.625
[yawning] all night long.

09:59.708 --> 10:01.625
Give yourself a break.

10:01.708 --> 10:04.708
You always said I was special
and now I finally know why.

10:04.792 --> 10:07.375
This! I'm the stopper of all evil!

10:07.458 --> 10:10.667
This mission chose me,
and the mission isn't over yet.

10:10.750 --> 10:13.167
There's still one bad guy left
who has yet to rear

10:13.250 --> 10:17.208
his big, huge, gigantic,
abnormally-sized...

10:17.292 --> 10:20.875
[Glumshanks] Sir? Sir?
It's time to wake up.

10:20.958 --> 10:22.750
Another sleepless night, sir?

10:22.833 --> 10:24.458
[wailing]

10:24.542 --> 10:28.083
I'm too depressed to sleep
because of those Skypukes

10:28.167 --> 10:31.292
and their pre-evil-detecting ways.

10:31.375 --> 10:33.750
Aw. Any chance you are likewise

10:33.833 --> 10:36.458
too depressed to throw
a boiling drink in my face?

10:36.542 --> 10:39.833
Oh, I suppose I could get up,
put on a fresh robe,

10:39.917 --> 10:42.250
throw this scalding-hot beverage
in your face...

10:42.875 --> 10:44.667
Ow.

10:44.750 --> 10:48.375
But if I can't commit evil,
then what's it all for?

10:48.458 --> 10:51.792
And I'm sure it's only a matter of time
before I concoct another brilliant scheme

10:51.875 --> 10:53.917
and the Skylanders come for me.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.917
[shrieks] I knew it, Glummy!

10:56.000 --> 10:58.375
It's happening!
The Skylanders are here!

10:58.458 --> 11:01.208
Either that or your mother
has decided to demolish your lair

11:01.292 --> 11:03.250
without checking if we were inside.

11:04.750 --> 11:06.292
[snoring]

11:06.375 --> 11:08.750
[snorts] What? How is it now?
Eruptor!

11:08.833 --> 11:11.417
How many times do I have to tell you
to do your rhythmic gymnastics

11:11.500 --> 11:13.125
somewhere else?

11:13.208 --> 11:15.208
[panting] What's happening?

11:15.292 --> 11:17.250
[gasps] Oh, no!

11:17.333 --> 11:20.583
There's a mysterious swirling ball
of something at the edge of Skylands!

11:20.667 --> 11:21.875
[all gasp]

11:21.958 --> 11:23.417
And that means what, exactly?

11:23.500 --> 11:27.583
Well, if my memory serves correct,
and let's be honest, it rarely does,

11:27.667 --> 11:29.708
that thing wasn't there last night.

11:29.792 --> 11:34.208
So it must be what's causing this outburst
of isle-quakes and violent winds.

11:34.292 --> 11:37.125
We need to figure out
what that thing is and stop it!

11:37.208 --> 11:39.292
Skylanders, un... [yawns]

11:39.375 --> 11:41.125
Oh, dear, sorry.
Good, you're all here.

11:41.208 --> 11:44.167
Yeah, and apparently we have to deal
with some swirly ball in the sky

11:44.250 --> 11:46.708
that's causing all this commotion.
How do we even do that?

11:46.792 --> 11:48.708
We need to get a ship,
fly up to that thing,

11:48.792 --> 11:50.333
and show it who's Skyboss.

11:50.417 --> 11:52.750
[grunting]

11:52.833 --> 11:55.208
[coughs] Oh, gosh, righto.

11:55.292 --> 11:59.375
So taking a ship out into this mess
would be a total suicide mission.

11:59.458 --> 12:01.208
[panting] Other ideas?

12:01.292 --> 12:03.417
Guys, I've been handling
all the other not-yet-evil

12:03.500 --> 12:05.542
that's not happened
in the past few days, so...

12:05.625 --> 12:07.875
let me take a crack at the swirly ball.

12:07.958 --> 12:10.500
Oh, well, I do need to see
a chiropractor suddenly.

12:10.583 --> 12:15.125
[stutters] I was gonna do some serious
binge-watching on Hugo's Skyflix account.

12:15.208 --> 12:17.875
To be honest, I'm in the middle
of an intense text chain

12:17.958 --> 12:19.458
and I kinda need to see
how it plays out.

12:19.542 --> 12:23.750
Okay, I'm on it. I'll fly up there
and knock this thing out before lunch...

12:23.833 --> 12:26.000
Nay, brunch.

12:26.083 --> 12:27.292
Spyro away!

12:28.333 --> 12:29.583
Well, I hope we made the right call.

12:30.458 --> 12:32.292
We totally made the wrong call.

12:32.375 --> 12:35.583
That swirly ball got ten times bigger
while we stood here!

12:35.667 --> 12:38.083
It's getting bigger
with each passing second.

12:38.167 --> 12:40.292
Now I'm not saying
it's definitely chewing up

12:40.375 --> 12:42.167
the very fabric of space-time
as we know it

12:42.250 --> 12:44.583
and will likely destroy our world,

12:44.667 --> 12:47.000
but that's probably what's happening.

12:50.042 --> 12:54.667
What? This is totally the appropriate
bodily function for this scenario.

12:54.750 --> 12:55.750
[all gasp]

12:55.833 --> 12:58.083
[reporter on TV]  This just in,
the Skylands are doomed!

12:58.167 --> 13:00.500
The isles are being blown apart
by violent storms.

13:00.583 --> 13:02.625
It's only a matter of time
before the damage is irreparable

13:02.708 --> 13:04.250
and Skylands will be no more!

13:04.333 --> 13:05.792
Now with traffic, here's Stu!

13:05.875 --> 13:08.292
[exclaims] Did you hear that, Glummy?

13:08.375 --> 13:09.833
The Skylands are finished.

13:09.917 --> 13:11.917
Everyone is going to be obliterated.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.250
"Everyone" meaning the Skylanders!

13:14.333 --> 13:16.167
[sing-song] I finally won!

13:16.250 --> 13:17.958
[vocalizing]

13:18.042 --> 13:21.875
Sir, you do realize that...
that "everyone" means us, too?

13:21.958 --> 13:23.167
[Kaos] Hmm!

13:23.250 --> 13:27.458
You're right. Guess I should be
more upset about dying. But...

13:27.542 --> 13:29.833
the ultimate destruction
of the Skylands just feels so good!

13:29.917 --> 13:31.583
[vocalizing]

13:31.667 --> 13:33.000
If these truly are the end of days,

13:33.083 --> 13:36.333
I better get some things
crossed off my bucket list before I go.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.625
[sighs] That was lovely.

13:46.708 --> 13:48.583
Now to number two on my list.

13:48.667 --> 13:50.458
Oh, Master...

13:51.833 --> 13:54.708
[grunting]

13:54.792 --> 13:56.625
Thinkin' maybe I should've layered up,

13:56.708 --> 13:59.042
or prepared in any way, shape, or form.

13:59.125 --> 14:01.208
Whoa! Everybody needs to calm down!

14:02.625 --> 14:06.292
You're not going to win,
swirly ball thing!

14:06.375 --> 14:09.083
This... ends... now!

14:10.667 --> 14:13.000
Whoa!
Easy on the wings!

14:13.083 --> 14:16.125
Easy on the wings!

14:18.125 --> 14:20.500
Spyro. He's... he's gone.

14:20.583 --> 14:21.667
[all gasping]

14:24.000 --> 14:27.375
Please. You're all just jealous
because you can't do it.

14:28.917 --> 14:30.917
[all screaming]

14:33.458 --> 14:35.167
[burping]

14:38.542 --> 14:40.417
I just can't believe Spyro is really gone.

14:40.500 --> 14:42.958
I was so looking forward
to having brunch with him.

14:43.042 --> 14:45.917
-We all were, Elf.
-[Hugo panting] Uh, everyone...

14:46.000 --> 14:49.583
Everyone, I made
Skyquake survival kits for all of us.

14:49.667 --> 14:50.958
Here!

14:52.583 --> 14:55.375
-Photos of Eon?
-Audio copies of Eon's self-help book?

14:55.458 --> 14:58.292
Water? Oh, wait.
No, that's actually helpful.

14:58.375 --> 15:02.333
Yes, team. These are the essentials
we'll need if we survive.

15:02.417 --> 15:03.667
Try and stay calm.

15:03.750 --> 15:07.750
And let my voice soothe
your frayed nerves.

15:07.833 --> 15:10.333
[Eon over recording]
Mastering Your Inner Wizard

15:10.417 --> 15:12.250
by Master Eon.

15:12.333 --> 15:14.083
Foreword by Master Eon.

15:14.167 --> 15:18.208
[yelps] Sir, maybe we should go somewhere
less prone to homicidal winds?

15:18.292 --> 15:21.250
-A nice basement, perhaps?
-No, Hugo.

15:21.333 --> 15:25.125
This is my academy,
and if it goes down, so be it.

15:25.208 --> 15:29.167
I'll look this storm straight in the eye
and go down with it.

15:29.250 --> 15:33.542
Right, uh... but what if some of us
actually want to survive?

15:33.625 --> 15:36.833
Yes, yes, I'm honored to die
with you, too, old friend.

15:41.167 --> 15:42.208
[yawns]

15:42.292 --> 15:43.333
[gasps]

15:43.417 --> 15:45.542
What? Where am I? Elf?

15:45.625 --> 15:49.208
Eruptor? Eon? Hello?

15:52.542 --> 15:56.750
Oh, no. Did I pass on?
This must be the afterlife.

15:56.833 --> 15:58.500
I thought there'd be
a few more light fixtures.

15:58.583 --> 15:59.708
[grunts]

15:59.792 --> 16:01.875
[groans and exhales]

16:01.958 --> 16:04.125
[moans] What the...

16:04.208 --> 16:06.958
[grunting]

16:07.042 --> 16:08.292
[groans]

16:09.750 --> 16:11.875
Busted, veg head, before you could do
anything truly heinous.

16:11.958 --> 16:13.458
What's that?

16:13.542 --> 16:15.333
[Broccoli Guy]  Eh, seems fair.
I was considering...

16:15.417 --> 16:17.958
That's when we stopped Broccoli Guy
from his pre-evil a few days ago.

16:18.042 --> 16:19.792
What was that?

16:19.875 --> 16:21.625
It sort of looked like the color
of the swirly ball of doom

16:21.708 --> 16:22.708
I was trying to defeat.

16:23.792 --> 16:26.417
Hot sauce on waffles?
What kind of sick...

16:26.500 --> 16:27.708
And that's when we stopped Pepper Jack.

16:27.792 --> 16:30.250
-I didn't even pour it on yet!
-[Spyro]  There's that mist again.

16:30.333 --> 16:33.000
Did that happen every time
we stopped future evil from happening?

16:36.458 --> 16:38.875
Wait a second.
Was Eruptor right?

16:38.958 --> 16:40.375
Is evil an actual thing

16:40.458 --> 16:43.875
that has to go somewhere
if it isn't being acted upon?

16:43.958 --> 16:47.125
[gasps] The swirling ball in the sky!

16:48.292 --> 16:51.542
That's where all the evil went to!
Oh, no.

16:51.625 --> 16:52.833
By eliminating all the evil,

16:52.917 --> 16:55.458
we created some sort of imbalance
in the universe,

16:55.542 --> 16:59.167
and I just kept adding to it by using
the evil-scope over and over again!

16:59.250 --> 17:05.541
Which means my obsessive heroism
is actually... the most evil thing of all!

17:05.625 --> 17:06.958
[gasps] What have I done?

17:07.041 --> 17:10.083
[grunts] Aw, come on, black void!

17:10.166 --> 17:12.333
I'm responsible for the end of the world.

17:12.416 --> 17:15.833
You can't give me a little wiggle room
to act like a drama queen here?

17:15.916 --> 17:19.750
-[Hugo humming in distance]
-[gasps] The team! The team!

17:19.833 --> 17:21.416
This must be right now! Guys!

17:21.500 --> 17:23.250
It's me! Spyro!

17:23.333 --> 17:25.458
-[Hugo humming]
-Spyro the dragon?

17:25.541 --> 17:28.041
They can't hear or see me.

17:28.125 --> 17:31.458
My friends are toast
and I can do nothing but watch.

17:31.542 --> 17:34.250
Talk about binge-worthy entertainment.

17:34.333 --> 17:35.583
[sighs deeply]

17:35.667 --> 17:38.417
Guess there's nothing to do now
but wait for the end.

17:38.500 --> 17:42.292
Time to close my eyes
and just try to remember the happy times.

17:42.375 --> 17:44.875
[sighs] There's the time I beat Kaos.

17:44.958 --> 17:47.583
There's that other time
I beat Kaos. [chuckles]

17:47.667 --> 17:50.875
Those tacos I had after defeating
that one guy, Kaos.

17:50.958 --> 17:53.167
Wait! If I'm the most evil thing,

17:53.250 --> 17:56.333
then getting out of this ball
should restore the balance!

17:56.417 --> 17:58.833
Looks like I'll have to non-science
the heck out of this!

17:58.917 --> 18:00.083
[grunting]

18:01.625 --> 18:02.792
[playing the kazoo]

18:02.875 --> 18:06.125
[Glumshanks]...that bucket that's
on your shoulders that you call a head,

18:06.208 --> 18:10.292
and that's what
I truly think of you, Steve!

18:10.375 --> 18:11.917
Huh? Glummy,
were you saying something?

18:12.000 --> 18:13.250
Oh, for the love of--

18:13.333 --> 18:16.417
I don't care! It's time for
the big end-of-Skylands countdown!

18:16.500 --> 18:19.833
Time to count!
Ten... nine...

18:19.917 --> 18:21.625
seven... twelve...

18:21.708 --> 18:22.792
-I literally have no words.
-...nine...

18:22.875 --> 18:24.292
[reporter on TV]  Six!

18:24.375 --> 18:27.583
[people on TV]  Five!
Four!

18:27.667 --> 18:30.625
Three!
Two!

18:35.250 --> 18:38.542
The ball! It exploded!
[yells] Incoming!

18:40.417 --> 18:42.625
-[groaning]
-Spyro, you're alive!

18:42.708 --> 18:43.917
-[gasps] He's back!
-Beauty!

18:44.000 --> 18:46.125
-Buddy!
-Spyro the dragon!

18:46.208 --> 18:48.292
I wanted your spot on the team.

18:52.833 --> 18:55.292
-[screaming]
-Ha! Keep the change!

18:59.792 --> 19:02.333
[sighs] Now, that was a good workout.

19:05.542 --> 19:06.917
[chuckles]

19:07.000 --> 19:08.625
-[horn honking]
-[yelps]

19:08.708 --> 19:10.875
Spyro, where did you go?

19:10.958 --> 19:15.000
We thought the storms pulled you apart
like so much dragon taffy.

19:15.083 --> 19:18.750
Me, too. But when I woke up,
I was trapped inside the swirly ball,

19:18.833 --> 19:22.125
a ball made of the evil energy
we took out thanks to the evil-scope.

19:22.208 --> 19:24.250
[all gasp and murmur]

19:24.333 --> 19:26.833
-Called it!
-But here's the craziest thing of all.

19:26.917 --> 19:29.542
I was the reason the ball got
so bloated with badness.

19:30.208 --> 19:32.917
I was so obsessed with stopping evil
that I didn't realize

19:33.000 --> 19:35.542
we were creating
a massive imbalance in our universe.

19:35.625 --> 19:38.500
It turns out good needs evil,
and vice versa!

19:38.583 --> 19:39.583
Right?

19:39.667 --> 19:42.500
Yeesh. Talk about saving the brain drains
for later, am I right?

19:43.125 --> 19:47.000
Actually what Spyro said is 100% true
and I... I should have mentioned it

19:47.083 --> 19:49.417
before you started sucking
all the evil from our world

19:49.500 --> 19:51.875
and creating imbalance,
which almost tore us all apart.

19:51.958 --> 19:55.042
Wait, wait, wait, wait. You knew that
my obsession with eliminating all the evil

19:55.125 --> 19:56.833
was going to create that ball of doom?

19:56.917 --> 19:58.250
It was a teachable moment.

20:00.208 --> 20:02.500
Now the important thing is,
Spyro saved the world

20:02.583 --> 20:05.333
after almost destroying it
with a magical lens and a ball of evil

20:05.417 --> 20:07.458
that were connected
for reasons we will never understand,

20:07.542 --> 20:10.250
so best to just celebrate our future,
not the past.

20:10.333 --> 20:12.583
Hold up.
I've got one more question.

20:12.667 --> 20:13.792
Who's that guy?

20:13.875 --> 20:15.083
Where am I?

20:15.167 --> 20:18.333
This is the Skylands
and you're at Skylander Academy.

20:18.417 --> 20:20.333
-What is your name, young man?
-Crash.

20:20.417 --> 20:22.125
Crash Bandicoot.

20:22.208 --> 20:24.708
And I have no idea how I got here.

20:24.792 --> 20:27.208
Last thing I remember,
I was on the Wumpa Islands

20:27.292 --> 20:28.833
and about to free my friend Tawna

20:28.917 --> 20:32.125
from the clutches of the evil
Dr. Neo Cortex.

20:32.208 --> 20:33.667
That guy just sounds like bad news.

20:33.750 --> 20:36.667
You don't even know the half of it, mate.

20:36.750 --> 20:39.250
Now I gotta get back there
and stop that madman

20:39.333 --> 20:43.333
from trying to mutate animals into an army
he will use to take over the world!

20:43.417 --> 20:44.625
Can you guys help me?

20:44.708 --> 20:47.250
We're the Skylanders.
We can do anything!

20:47.333 --> 20:51.625
I get it! You crash into things
and you're a bandicoot!

20:51.708 --> 20:53.583
Crash Bandicoot!

20:54.542 --> 20:56.167
Oh, is that not it?

20:56.250 --> 20:59.042
[reporter on TV]  The Skylands
have been saved, we think.

20:59.125 --> 21:00.417
-[gasps]
-We're totally guessing.

21:00.500 --> 21:03.458
So everything is... fine again?

21:03.542 --> 21:05.125
Son of my mother!

21:05.208 --> 21:06.667
Why, universe?

21:06.750 --> 21:08.958
Why couldn't you just kill us all?

21:09.042 --> 21:12.250
Can't you let me be happy just once?

21:12.333 --> 21:14.625
-[crying]
-There, there, sir.

21:14.708 --> 21:15.708
We may have survived,

21:15.792 --> 21:18.833
but at least you didn't hear
all the nasty things I said about you.

21:18.917 --> 21:21.000
Oh, no. [sniffs]
I heard every word.

21:21.083 --> 21:24.625
And making you pay for every single one
is the only thing I have to live for.

21:24.708 --> 21:26.417
You're, uh... welcome?

21:26.500 --> 21:28.917
Come, Glummy.
We'll start with your favorite,

21:29.000 --> 21:30.792
dunking your head
in a music festival toilet.

21:30.875 --> 21:34.333
Ah, yes, that old chestnut.
Good times.

21:34.417 --> 21:37.125
You know, we should use
whatever the Skylanders did

21:37.208 --> 21:38.917
to make their evil-detecting machine.

21:39.000 --> 21:42.958
Then I'd finally be able to see
into my future with the Golden Queen!

21:43.042 --> 21:44.792
