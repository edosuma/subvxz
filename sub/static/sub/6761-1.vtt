<i>Wake up. Wake up.</i>

00:23.165 --> 00:27.920
<i>Wake up. Wake up.</i>

00:29.004 --> 00:33.592
<i>Wake up.</i>

00:43.268 --> 00:45.646
First day of school.

00:46.021 --> 00:49.942
Strange city. New house. No friends.

00:51.443 --> 00:53.195
I'm psyched.

01:03.372 --> 01:05.331
Not gonna work.

01:06.416 --> 01:09.377
I have nothing to wear. Great.

01:11.922 --> 01:12.964
No.

01:13.048 --> 01:16.343
<i>We've got a Sigalert on the Santa
Monica 10 Freeway, eastbound.</i>

01:16.426 --> 01:18.303
<i>One-hour delay due to a three-vehicle...</i>

01:18.386 --> 01:21.306
Honey! It's gridlock out there.
I gotta run.

01:21.556 --> 01:23.016
I'll be down in a sec.

01:27.562 --> 01:30.023
Mom, let's go shopping today,
and I'll go to school tomorrow.

01:30.106 --> 01:31.775
First impressions
are incredibly important.

01:31.858 --> 01:34.319
Honey, you can make
a wonderful first impression.

01:34.444 --> 01:36.821
Everybody here looks like
they just stepped out of a music video.

01:36.905 --> 01:38.573
I don't even have the right hair.

01:42.243 --> 01:45.330
Brandon, get up. Wake up.
You're gonna make us late.

01:45.663 --> 01:47.415
Give me one good reason.

01:47.582 --> 01:50.001
You got to help me pick out
something to wear.

01:51.461 --> 01:52.879
What's the difference?

01:52.962 --> 01:56.299
Brandon, I know you were
Mr Popularity back home,

01:57.008 --> 01:59.093
but I'm not gonna miss Minneapolis.

01:59.177 --> 02:02.847
Nobody knows me here.
I could be anybody.

02:03.431 --> 02:04.807
I could be somebody.

02:05.141 --> 02:07.101
Like what? Homecoming Queen?

02:07.435 --> 02:08.603
Right.

02:08.686 --> 02:11.939
Hey, look, why not?
I mean, you're cute enough.

02:12.565 --> 02:15.443
Hey! You remember
that black T-shirt you wore

02:15.526 --> 02:18.613
at Denise Baum's Fourth of July party?
That was cool.

02:20.198 --> 02:21.449
No.

02:22.366 --> 02:23.701
Okay, fine.

02:24.494 --> 02:26.287
So, she spends an hour
in front of the mirror,

02:26.370 --> 02:28.581
and now she's gotta go
change her clothes.

02:29.957 --> 02:31.417
Where's the toaster?

02:38.758 --> 02:40.301
I'll skip breakfast.

05:12.035 --> 05:14.912
I think we're gonna need a raise
in our allowance.

05:14.996 --> 05:16.331
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

05:16.789 --> 05:18.541
<i>Yo, yo, this is the Flash,</i>

05:18.624 --> 05:22.503
<i>coming to you with over 500 nasty,
jamming, body-slamming watts,</i>

05:22.587 --> 05:26.674
on KWBH,
the voice of West Beverly High.

05:28.176 --> 05:30.178
Come on, let's go, let's go!

05:31.512 --> 05:34.682
<i>Welcome, incoming freshmen.</i>

05:43.649 --> 05:45.359
I love this place!

06:22.229 --> 06:23.981
They gave you a license?

06:24.064 --> 06:26.317
- Hi, Steve.
- Where you been all summer?

06:26.400 --> 06:28.819
I tried calling you like 300 times.

06:33.115 --> 06:36.869
- You got a nose job.
- Yeah, I did.

06:36.952 --> 06:38.620
It looks good.

06:38.912 --> 06:42.499
- Big improvement, huh?
- Well, yeah, they took about a foot off.

06:44.835 --> 06:47.087
Now I know why I broke up with you.

06:47.421 --> 06:49.131
Oh, hey, get off it. Hey.

06:49.465 --> 06:51.425
I'm the guy that taught you
how to work that clutch.

06:51.508 --> 06:53.844
I drive an automatic,
thank you very much.

06:53.927 --> 06:55.137
Figures.

07:17.367 --> 07:18.702
Bye-bye.

07:20.162 --> 07:22.205
- Bye.
- Bye.

07:37.012 --> 07:39.139
- Look for me at lunch, okay?
- Sure.

07:39.222 --> 07:41.891
I don't wanna look like some geek
without any friends.

07:41.975 --> 07:45.437
Great. Together we'll look like
two geeks without any friends.

07:45.687 --> 07:47.230
A joke, okay?

07:49.065 --> 07:50.984
We're supposed to check in here.

07:52.318 --> 07:56.072
Swim team,
sports editor of your school paper,

07:56.573 --> 07:59.951
all-state cross country,
and you still managed to keep a 3.8.

08:01.786 --> 08:05.748
Drama club, student council,
almost a straight-A student.

08:05.832 --> 08:08.209
Yeah, well,
I help her with her homework a little.

08:08.418 --> 08:11.254
You're both used to doing well.
You're both achievers.

08:11.921 --> 08:14.465
And I don't want to diminish
your accomplishment, guys,

08:14.549 --> 08:17.635
but I don't want to kid you either.
West Beverly High is tough.

08:17.969 --> 08:19.679
The kids are very competitive.

08:20.305 --> 08:23.057
So, if you have any problems,
academic or otherwise,

08:23.141 --> 08:25.685
come talk to me.
That's what I'm here for.

08:30.273 --> 08:33.192
Now, get going. I don't want
you to be late for your first class.

08:38.448 --> 08:41.241
Mr Clayton, would you please explain
to this young man

08:41.325 --> 08:43.703
our new restrictions
on leather this year?

08:53.045 --> 08:57.591
- Hey, what's up, Scott?
- I can't find my locker. Number 15-33.

08:57.758 --> 09:00.511
This place is huge,
like five times as big as junior high.

09:00.594 --> 09:02.596
Yeah, I know,
the steps are even bigger,

09:02.805 --> 09:06.475
but the babes are outrageous.

09:13.065 --> 09:14.817
Choose your seat with care.

09:14.900 --> 09:17.236
The person sitting next to you
will be your lab partner

09:17.319 --> 09:18.988
for the rest of the semester.

09:42.803 --> 09:45.723
- Sorry, it's taken.
- By who?

09:47.015 --> 09:48.308
By that girl.

09:49.309 --> 09:51.103
Over here. I saved you a seat.

09:55.691 --> 09:59.027
Look, I think you have me confused
with somebody else.

09:59.236 --> 10:02.197
- That's okay, I'm being friendly.
- Oh, thanks.

10:02.698 --> 10:04.491
- My name is Brenda.
- I'm Kelly.

10:04.658 --> 10:05.701
Hi.

10:06.285 --> 10:09.288
- Are you smart?
- Sort of.

10:09.788 --> 10:12.958
Great. This class is a real bitch.
I need all the help I can get.

11:10.348 --> 11:13.101
How bogus. Lady gets paid
to speak her native tongue.

11:46.217 --> 11:49.137
Excuse me.
Is Andrea Zuckerman around?

11:49.220 --> 11:50.388
I am she.

11:57.228 --> 12:00.189
We're in Spanish together. I'm Brandon.

12:05.861 --> 12:09.573
- So, I want to write for the paper.
- Can you write?

12:10.366 --> 12:13.994
Well, I was the sports editor
at my old school in Minneapolis.

12:14.328 --> 12:15.413
Great.

12:15.788 --> 12:17.498
Which story would you like to cover?

12:17.581 --> 12:20.418
The toxic waste disposal
in our chemistry classes,

12:20.501 --> 12:23.587
or the girls' water polo match
against Beverly High?

12:23.671 --> 12:26.298
Well, we didn't have
a girls' water polo team back home,

12:26.382 --> 12:29.760
so I'll take the new experience.
What time does the game start?

12:31.136 --> 12:32.930
You definitely failed my test.

12:34.223 --> 12:35.391
I don't get it.

12:37.893 --> 12:40.938
You see, whenever a guy
wants to work on the school paper,

12:41.021 --> 12:44.483
I ask him, "Do you want to cover
the girls' water polo match,

12:44.566 --> 12:47.403
"or do you want to do
the toxic waste story?"

12:48.153 --> 12:51.448
Not one guy has ever wanted to do
the toxic waste story.

12:51.615 --> 12:54.493
- Why is that, Brandon?
- Human nature.

12:55.953 --> 12:57.246
No offence,

12:57.704 --> 12:59.748
but this is the top-ranked high school
paper in the country,

12:59.832 --> 13:00.958
and I intend to keep it that way,

13:01.041 --> 13:04.628
so I suggest you put aside your dreams
of editing the swimsuit issue

13:04.711 --> 13:06.046
<i>of Sports Illustrated.</i>

13:06.129 --> 13:09.383
We are talking long hours,
major deadlines and total commitment.

13:09.716 --> 13:11.176
Still interested?

13:11.760 --> 13:14.263
- Wow, you are intense.
- I know.

13:14.721 --> 13:16.932
But that's what it takes to do
what we do around here.

13:17.015 --> 13:20.352
So, if you're not willing to make
the sacrifices, I totally understand.

13:21.812 --> 13:24.856
Guess I should start
by interviewing the janitor, huh?

13:26.566 --> 13:28.151
Custodial Engineer.

13:28.985 --> 13:30.737
And, Brandon,

13:32.823 --> 13:36.034
- nice meeting you.
- Nice meeting you, too.

14:15.406 --> 14:17.200
You know, it's a good thing
you met me when you did.

14:17.283 --> 14:20.703
West Beverly isn't like other schools.
Kids here are richer.

14:20.787 --> 14:22.372
Some of their parents are celebs.

14:22.580 --> 14:25.625
So, it's definitely not
your normal high school.

14:25.917 --> 14:27.585
And socially it's really intense.

14:27.794 --> 14:29.963
You make one false move
and you're history.

14:30.046 --> 14:32.006
I mean, if people here saw you
eating lunch alone today,

14:32.090 --> 14:33.675
like that guy over there...

14:34.801 --> 14:37.762
You know, I had a lot of great friends
at my old school.

14:37.929 --> 14:39.847
- In Minneapolis?
- Yeah.

14:40.473 --> 14:41.974
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:42.100 --> 14:44.477
But it's so cold.
I could never deal with cold.

14:44.644 --> 14:46.813
- You'd get over it.
- Oh, I'd get fat.

14:46.896 --> 14:49.357
Yeah, it's great. I mean, all winter
you can eat whatever you want,

14:49.440 --> 14:53.152
- and then hide it under bulky sweaters.
- That's definitely not Beverly Hills.

14:53.236 --> 14:54.987
Somebody here is always throwing
a pool party,

14:55.071 --> 14:57.698
so you never really get a chance
to pig out, you know?

14:58.449 --> 15:00.076
I can't believe we've got all this reading.

15:00.159 --> 15:02.870
<i>The Great Gatsby by next week.
That's an 11th grade book.</i>

15:02.954 --> 15:06.082
Yeah, plus Trig, History, French,
Biology. It's outrageous.

15:06.165 --> 15:07.625
What's gonna happen
to our social lives?

15:07.708 --> 15:10.920
I'm asking my mother for a tutor.
If you screw up in the ninth grade,

15:11.003 --> 15:13.714
you can permanently damage
your high school GPA.

15:13.798 --> 15:15.341
Think fast!

15:17.677 --> 15:19.178
I hate jocks.

15:19.845 --> 15:21.472
- Good job, man.
- Yes.

15:21.931 --> 15:22.973
Nailed him.

15:53.879 --> 15:57.341
"Back-to-school jam, Friday.
150 Summit Lane."

15:57.424 --> 16:00.886
Yes! Yes, we're there. We are there.

16:01.386 --> 16:03.806
Oh, my God,
that's Marianne Moore's house.

16:03.889 --> 16:06.683
She's incredibly rich,
but such a party girl.

16:06.767 --> 16:09.728
I hear her house is so big,
you need a map to get around.

16:09.812 --> 16:11.396
I cannot believe she's inviting
the whole school.

16:11.480 --> 16:13.607
I mean, that must be 1,800 people.

16:18.737 --> 16:20.697
Well, make that 1,300.

16:20.948 --> 16:23.241
- Wanna go together?
- Yeah, sure.

16:30.374 --> 16:31.750
Great.

16:34.294 --> 16:35.837
We're still going.

16:40.759 --> 16:43.929
God, I can't believe we made it
through the first day of school.

16:44.054 --> 16:45.597
So, what did you think?

16:45.680 --> 16:48.350
We're definitely not
in Minneapolis any more.

16:48.433 --> 16:52.312
- What did you think?
- It's weird not knowing anybody.

16:52.520 --> 16:55.357
It's like, I don't know who they are,
they don't know who I am.

16:55.440 --> 16:56.650
I don't know. I kind of got the feeling

16:56.733 --> 16:59.319
that people wanted to say hello to me,
but they were afraid to.

16:59.402 --> 17:02.364
Yeah, I know what you mean.
I was getting those kind of looks all day.

17:02.447 --> 17:04.491
- So, are we gonna hit this party?
- Definitely.

17:04.574 --> 17:06.451
So, what time do you think
we should go there?

17:06.534 --> 17:09.788
I mean, I think it would be very uncool
if we showed up before 10:00.

17:09.871 --> 17:12.624
Actually, I've sort of
already made plans.

17:12.790 --> 17:14.334
- With who?
- Just some friends.

17:14.416 --> 17:16.252
We're all going together.
Kind of a girl thing.

17:16.336 --> 17:19.088
- But you should join us if you want to.
- No, no, no, that's all right.

17:19.172 --> 17:21.174
You go ahead and have a good time.

17:21.508 --> 17:24.636
- Really? You won't be upset?
- Upset?

17:25.845 --> 17:28.348
Am I the kind of person that gets upset?

17:29.724 --> 17:32.685
Seriously, it's no big deal.
I'll see you there.

17:43.821 --> 17:46.949
Oh, my God.
I would die if my mom did that to me.

17:47.033 --> 17:49.160
Give her a break,
she's from out of town.

17:53.456 --> 17:55.416
Mom, this is Kelly.
Kelly, this is my mom.

17:55.500 --> 17:57.210
- Hi, Kelly.
- Hi.

17:58.211 --> 18:00.588
This is Donna and Cathy and Michelle.

18:00.671 --> 18:01.714
- Hi.
- Hi.

18:01.797 --> 18:03.466
Hi. Well, it's nice to meet you.

18:03.549 --> 18:05.635
You look like you're ready to have
a real good time.

18:09.055 --> 18:10.640
When's your curfew?

18:11.140 --> 18:12.308
Excuse me?

18:12.433 --> 18:14.018
Mom, I told you.

18:16.354 --> 18:17.688
Midnight, okay?

18:18.189 --> 18:19.231
12:30.

18:20.316 --> 18:21.567
12:15.

18:25.946 --> 18:28.282
That was so embarrassing.

18:35.664 --> 18:38.167
Here you go, buddy.
I know just where to put it.

18:39.210 --> 18:40.294
Hey, Steve.

18:40.377 --> 18:43.631
- Brandon. How you doing?
- Good. Nice car.

18:43.714 --> 18:45.674
Well, you gotta have something
to live for, right?

18:46.634 --> 18:50.638
So, what's the deal with this girl?
I mean, does she have parents?

18:51.347 --> 18:54.224
- Hop in.
- All right.

18:55.809 --> 18:57.936
Welcome to West Beverly High.

19:20.584 --> 19:22.711
Hey, Kelly, you're looking good.

19:23.712 --> 19:25.881
He has never said hello to me before.

19:25.964 --> 19:27.674
Okay, so it changed your life.

19:28.342 --> 19:30.844
Hey, maybe I should have the bump
taken off mine.

19:31.887 --> 19:34.639
I had a deviated septum.

19:35.515 --> 19:38.852
- Rhinoplasty, you know.
- A nose job?

19:39.686 --> 19:42.272
- It's beautiful.
- It is, isn't it?

19:42.731 --> 19:45.358
God, I wish I looked like this
when I was a freshman.

19:45.901 --> 19:48.695
See? I decided on this one.

19:49.070 --> 19:50.155
I like this one.

19:53.325 --> 19:56.119
- Who are you waving to?
- My brother, Brandon.

19:56.453 --> 19:57.913
Oh, he's cute.

19:59.539 --> 20:02.250
Oh, God, he's hanging out
with Steve Sanders.

20:02.709 --> 20:05.295
- Who's that?
- My ex.

20:05.754 --> 20:10.008
He's having a tough time
getting the message that it's O-V-E-R.

20:10.342 --> 20:12.052
My sister over there.

20:13.094 --> 20:14.929
She's hanging out with Kelly Taylor.

20:15.347 --> 20:17.348
- The blonde?
- Yeah.

20:17.891 --> 20:21.186
- She's cute.
- Yeah, that's my ex-girlfriend.

20:21.686 --> 20:24.856
- What happened?
- I dumped her.

20:28.943 --> 20:31.946
I'll bet you in another couple of hours
girls will be taking their tops off.

20:32.030 --> 20:33.907
- Oh, you think?
- Oh, definitely.

20:34.240 --> 20:35.950
Oh, but we're not gonna be here.

20:36.034 --> 20:38.369
My mother's coming
to pick us up at 11:00.

20:38.578 --> 20:40.538
If I see flesh, I'm staying.

20:43.916 --> 20:45.627
Hey, what's up, dudes?

20:46.461 --> 20:49.422
I think we should leave.
I don't feel welcome.

20:49.505 --> 20:52.008
Look, would you just relax
and have some punch or something?

20:54.719 --> 20:57.013
- There's that girl I was telling you about.
- Where?

20:57.096 --> 20:58.973
- The blonde!
- Wow.

20:59.056 --> 21:03.811
- I wonder if she'd go for younger guys.
- Oh, I doubt it.

21:04.729 --> 21:06.856
I'm gonna move a little closer to her.

21:07.773 --> 21:09.483
What about me?

21:10.860 --> 21:12.278
Mingle.

21:23.748 --> 21:25.791
No freshmen!

22:17.050 --> 22:19.595
Excuse me, are you here by yourself?

22:22.222 --> 22:24.474
I don't believe it. I'm here by myself, too.

22:26.185 --> 22:29.855
- This party really sucks.
- I know.

22:30.731 --> 22:33.275
I mean, for someone
who doesn't know anybody.

22:33.942 --> 22:35.027
Why don't you know anyone?

22:35.110 --> 22:36.737
Don't you go to Beverly
or West Beverly High?

22:36.820 --> 22:39.781
I go to West Beverly,
but I just moved here.

22:40.365 --> 22:42.451
- Lucky you.
- Yeah.

22:44.202 --> 22:45.787
So what's your story?

22:48.874 --> 22:50.333
You're sexy.

22:54.421 --> 22:57.424
Thanks. So are you.

22:57.757 --> 23:00.260
- Do you wanna dance?
- Sure.

23:00.343 --> 23:01.553
Right here?

23:03.221 --> 23:05.223
- Okay.
- Okay.

23:11.938 --> 23:16.818
You know, these parties, I hate them.
Every year, same crowd, same people.

23:17.444 --> 23:20.363
- So why do you come?
- I had no choice.

23:20.905 --> 23:22.240
Why not?

23:23.867 --> 23:25.201
It's my house.

23:26.244 --> 23:28.663
Wait a minute. Whoa, whoa, whoa,
hold it. This is your party?

23:28.747 --> 23:31.666
Wait, don't. You smell so good.
What is that you're wearing?

23:33.126 --> 23:35.753
I don't know. Tide?

23:39.048 --> 23:41.634
- So what's your name?
- Marianne.

23:41.718 --> 23:44.429
- What's your name?
- Brandon.

23:44.846 --> 23:47.682
- Hi, Brandon.
- Hi.

23:49.976 --> 23:51.936
So, isn't this kind of weird?

23:52.228 --> 23:54.814
Not talking to anybody
at your own party?

23:54.897 --> 23:58.901
I don't know,
I mean, my parents tell me to be social.

23:59.027 --> 24:01.028
God knows they are.

24:03.364 --> 24:06.409
I mean, just because I'm popular
doesn't mean I have to like everybody.

24:10.204 --> 24:13.791
- Well, it was nice meeting you.
- Hey, hey, wait a second.

24:15.626 --> 24:20.006
- Could I call you sometime?
- Sure.

24:21.632 --> 24:22.883
Anytime.

24:42.653 --> 24:44.447
Try not to smear it.

24:50.953 --> 24:53.998
Everybody, go for it!

25:30.200 --> 25:32.661
What we have to do
is get ourselves some fake IDs,

25:32.744 --> 25:34.830
get into some clubs,
meet some older guys.

25:34.913 --> 25:37.291
- Do you really think we'd pass as 21?
- Oh, definitely.

25:37.374 --> 25:38.625
It's all in the attitude.

25:38.709 --> 25:39.751
Hey, hey.

25:39.835 --> 25:42.212
- Hi.
- Hi.

25:42.838 --> 25:44.881
You wanna dance?

25:46.133 --> 25:48.051
No, thanks. I'm fine right here.

25:48.135 --> 25:50.721
Oh, come on. Everybody's dancing.

25:51.263 --> 25:53.557
What do you want from me?
I said I don't wanna dance.

25:53.640 --> 25:56.435
- You are so cold, you know that?
- Get over it, Steve.

25:56.518 --> 25:58.812
No, get over yourself!

25:59.813 --> 26:02.149
- You're really strong.
- All right, Kelly.

26:05.735 --> 26:06.820
Hey.

26:06.903 --> 26:09.614
- You know her?
- Yeah, I know her.

26:10.031 --> 26:11.366
She's hot.

26:11.449 --> 26:15.161
She is the biggest bitch
at West Beverly High.

26:15.620 --> 26:17.831
I should know,
I went out with her for a year.

26:18.873 --> 26:21.584
- Well, what happened?
- I dumped her.

26:22.127 --> 26:25.505
She's lousy in bed.
She's got a nasty personality.

26:26.006 --> 26:29.300
- I could live with that.
- Who are you?

26:29.843 --> 26:33.346
- Oh, David Silver.
- Steve Sanders.

26:37.725 --> 26:40.812
Wait a second. Wait, wait, your mom,

26:41.062 --> 26:46.025
<i>she's not Samantha Sanders,
from The Hartley House?</i>

26:46.526 --> 26:48.861
I grew up watching that show in reruns.

26:48.945 --> 26:51.948
For five years she was on channel four
at 7:30,

26:52.490 --> 26:57.161
then channel seven at 6:30,
and then she was on twice a day,

26:57.495 --> 27:00.248
once at 9:00 in the morning
and once at 5:30.

27:00.331 --> 27:02.166
All right, I get the point.

27:02.500 --> 27:06.379
I gotta tell you, I love your mom.
I mean, she is, like, the perfect mom.

27:08.673 --> 27:13.845
Look, I hate to break your heart,
but my mom, she's not the perfect mom,

27:14.345 --> 27:17.056
and that ain't the perfect girl.

27:23.896 --> 27:25.231
My ride.

27:27.024 --> 27:28.067
Scott.

27:28.901 --> 27:30.194
Scott.

27:40.788 --> 27:44.417
Have you seen a friend of mine?
He's kind of skinny and wet.

27:50.673 --> 27:52.007
You ditched me, you dork.

27:52.091 --> 27:53.259
Hey, wait up!

27:57.054 --> 27:59.849
Oh, come on, I'm all right. I can drive!
I can...

27:59.932 --> 28:01.934
Hey, come on, man.

28:02.685 --> 28:05.729
- Hey, let's not get crazy, all right?
- Got him.

28:05.813 --> 28:09.483
Dude, you're not driving. You're trashed.

28:11.151 --> 28:13.696
There's my buddy, he'll drive me home.

28:14.446 --> 28:16.865
- Hey, guy.
- I can't do...

28:16.949 --> 28:18.158
This is my car.

28:18.909 --> 28:20.077
Oh, my God.

28:21.412 --> 28:23.580
Here are the car keys, bud.

28:25.082 --> 28:26.750
- Hey, sober up!
- Thanks, dude.

28:26.834 --> 28:28.836
- Thanks a lot.
- Oh, watch my feet!

28:38.011 --> 28:42.891
- So, where do you live?
- I live at Doheny Road, 4203.

28:45.018 --> 28:47.396
- Look, I don't think I can do this.
- Oh, sure.

28:47.479 --> 28:50.649
Just put the gas in the ignition
and step on the key.

28:51.900 --> 28:54.778
Okay, but before we get going,
I just have to tell you one thing.

28:55.487 --> 28:56.988
What?

28:57.656 --> 29:00.951
I don't have my license.
Is that a problem for you?

29:06.289 --> 29:07.666
Guess not.

29:13.547 --> 29:15.006
Yeah, baby. Yeah.

29:38.696 --> 29:40.198
I need some air.

29:40.573 --> 29:42.575
Hey, hey, don't do that!

29:43.118 --> 29:44.786
Hey! Wait.

29:45.036 --> 29:47.914
Hey, hey! Where'd you learn
how to drive, man?

29:47.997 --> 29:51.417
Look, I'm doing better than you could,
and I don't even know how.

29:52.210 --> 29:56.381
I can't believe you'd buy a car like this
and even think of driving home drunk.

29:56.756 --> 29:59.467
I'm not driving, you're driving.

30:06.140 --> 30:08.810
Hey, how's it going?

30:09.102 --> 30:10.728
Oh, my God.

30:12.563 --> 30:16.484
Hey, Steve,
there's some geek driving your car!

30:20.029 --> 30:21.572
She told you.

30:28.955 --> 30:31.123
Sit up. There's a cop behind us.

30:45.012 --> 30:47.056
Wildcats number one!

30:57.066 --> 30:58.526
It's not funny.

31:37.648 --> 31:39.066
- I'm fine.
- Come on.

31:44.780 --> 31:46.615
All right, all right. I'm all right.

31:49.618 --> 31:53.330
Thanks a lot, buddy.
I'm gonna remember you for this.

31:56.249 --> 31:59.336
No problem. Catch you later.

32:30.283 --> 32:33.370
- So, you must be pretty excited.
- Why?

32:34.079 --> 32:35.330
You get to see Marianne today.

32:35.413 --> 32:37.499
Oh, jeez,
will you stop with that, already?

32:37.582 --> 32:40.335
Hey, you're the one who's been
talking about her all weekend long.

32:40.418 --> 32:43.213
"Do you think she's pretty, Brenda?
I mean, really pretty?"

32:43.296 --> 32:45.423
"Do you think
that she would go out with me?"

32:45.507 --> 32:48.718
- Wish I met somebody at the party.
- You will.

32:50.887 --> 32:54.057
Oh, I don't know, Brend.
We're so different.

32:54.140 --> 32:57.810
- I mean, she's so rich and we're so...
- Normal?

32:58.269 --> 32:59.479
Yeah.

32:59.938 --> 33:01.356
How could I know if she's even serious?

33:01.439 --> 33:03.858
I mean, she probably talked
to a million guys that night.

33:03.942 --> 33:06.945
Are you kidding? She would be lucky
to have a date with you.

33:07.737 --> 33:09.364
You're just saying that
'cause you're my sister,

33:09.447 --> 33:11.658
- and you have to say things like that.
- I do not.

33:11.741 --> 33:13.868
I'm saying that objectively, as a girl.

33:13.951 --> 33:17.789
Oh, that's right, you are a girl.
I forgot about that for a second.

33:17.872 --> 33:21.793
<i>Yo, yo!
And now for the morning Flash report.</i>

33:22.210 --> 33:25.338
<i>Friday night's party
at Marianne Moore's house was...</i>

33:26.422 --> 33:29.884
<i>Yeah, and we already have a contender
for the Flash-man of the year,</i>

33:29.967 --> 33:33.763
<i>a major waste case, Steve Sanders.</i>

33:34.388 --> 33:36.307
<i>Remember much, Steve?</i>

33:46.025 --> 33:48.027
Try not to stare too much.

33:55.785 --> 33:58.496
- How's it going?
- Not too well.

33:59.163 --> 34:01.916
Listen, did you see the guy
who drove me home from that party?

34:08.797 --> 34:10.841
- No, why? What happened?
- Somebody...

34:19.641 --> 34:20.976
Somebody totaled my car.

34:25.230 --> 34:26.440
What did she say?

34:28.192 --> 34:30.319
I think she wants you
to be the butcher man.

34:30.444 --> 34:31.487
What?

34:32.529 --> 34:36.824
Look, I don't want to be
the butcher man, okay?

34:38.534 --> 34:40.536
<i>Yo estoy vegetarian.</i>

34:48.378 --> 34:50.214
He's gonna kill me.
I'm just waiting to die.

34:50.297 --> 34:52.049
I can't believe
you actually drove his Vette.

34:52.132 --> 34:53.175
Where did you learn how to drive?

34:53.257 --> 34:55.010
Well, my dad lets me drive
his Vette sometimes.

34:55.092 --> 34:56.762
That's what happens
when your parents get divorced,

34:56.844 --> 34:58.639
your dad lets you do
incredibly stupid things

34:58.722 --> 35:00.182
because he only sees you on weekends.

35:00.432 --> 35:04.686
Doln had thought that
the chemical formula for water was HO.

35:04.770 --> 35:07.564
"Ho." Ho, indeed.

35:13.111 --> 35:16.156
- Wow, this is going to be great.
- Let me see.

35:16.239 --> 35:17.324
No, not yet.

35:18.867 --> 35:22.037
You are gonna be able to get into
any club in town with this.

35:22.287 --> 35:23.622
I'm such an artist.

35:23.705 --> 35:27.000
Excuse me, ladies,
in the back of the room.

35:27.417 --> 35:30.503
I'm not in the mood
to lecture preschoolers,

35:30.587 --> 35:32.964
so either have the courtesy
to pay attention,

35:33.048 --> 35:35.091
or get out of my class now.

35:36.134 --> 35:38.219
I'll show you at lunch, okay?

36:03.995 --> 36:05.747
Wow, 1969.

36:05.830 --> 36:07.290
Do you think anybody
would really believe it?

36:07.373 --> 36:08.541
I mean, that I'm that old?

36:08.625 --> 36:10.418
First of all, nobody here even knows

36:10.501 --> 36:12.462
what a Minnesota driver's license
looks like.

36:12.545 --> 36:15.798
And anyway, I think it all depends
on whether the doorman thinks

36:15.882 --> 36:17.175
you're cute or not.

36:18.009 --> 36:22.096
It's against the law.
I've never broken a law before.

36:22.889 --> 36:24.974
God, I am such a wuss.

36:25.266 --> 36:27.602
Look, the worst that can happen is
they don't let you in.

36:29.020 --> 36:32.398
- So, when are we gonna test this out?
- Saturday night.

36:32.690 --> 36:35.234
The Blue Iguana. Are we there?

36:38.446 --> 36:39.697
Definitely.

36:40.072 --> 36:41.490
- Yes.
- All right.

37:05.556 --> 37:07.099
Marianne.

37:09.018 --> 37:10.186
Marianne.

37:10.769 --> 37:11.937
- Hi.
- Hi.

37:13.856 --> 37:15.649
What are you doing
sitting way out here?

37:16.442 --> 37:17.902
It's my reserved table.

37:19.987 --> 37:22.573
- Mind if I sit down?
- No. Go for it.

37:24.533 --> 37:28.245
- Great party the other night.
- I thought you said you had a lousy time.

37:28.537 --> 37:31.248
No, I meant the part where I met you.

37:31.582 --> 37:34.001
Oh. Thanks.

37:37.504 --> 37:40.048
Listen, do you wanna go to Paris
for the weekend?

37:40.174 --> 37:42.176
I think if we leave Friday night,
we can make it back

37:42.259 --> 37:44.845
by late Monday morning.
I'll only have to miss two classes.

37:44.928 --> 37:46.054
Seriously?

37:48.974 --> 37:51.268
No, no, not seriously.

37:51.351 --> 37:53.812
No, no, no, this...
We can do it. It is possible.

37:53.896 --> 37:57.816
No, no, no, I was...
I was kidding. Really.

38:01.695 --> 38:04.197
Hey, why don't we save Paris
for another weekend,

38:04.531 --> 38:07.117
maybe go someplace a little more local,

38:08.201 --> 38:11.788
like, Saturday night,
maybe around 8:00.

38:12.748 --> 38:14.875
Okay. Sounds great.

38:15.751 --> 38:18.295
- You know where I live.
- Great.

38:23.967 --> 38:26.178
You wanna trade
for a peanut butter and jelly?

38:29.890 --> 38:32.726
Do you know any good places to go
for dinner, like, on a Saturday night?

38:32.809 --> 38:34.519
Wait a second.
Where's the article on toxic waste?

38:34.603 --> 38:36.646
- I'm holding page one.
- I'm on it. I'm on it.

38:36.730 --> 38:39.482
I just need to talk to Mr Ridley
about some chemistry facts.

38:39.566 --> 38:41.735
Brandon, come on.
We are on a deadline.

38:41.818 --> 38:44.487
- I know deadlines.
- Tomorrow, or I do it myself.

38:44.571 --> 38:47.824
- It's my reputation on the line.
- Okay!

38:50.076 --> 38:52.287
So, why weren't you at
Marianne Moore's party the other night?

38:52.370 --> 38:54.956
- Brandon, I never go to parties.
- Why not?

38:55.749 --> 38:57.667
Because hanging out
with a bunch of people acting stupid

38:57.751 --> 38:59.836
is not gonna get me
into the lvy League.

39:00.545 --> 39:03.214
Don't you have anything else in your life
besides school?

39:03.548 --> 39:04.757
Brandon, who has the time?

39:04.841 --> 39:07.385
I already spend 10 hours
of community service a week.

39:07.468 --> 39:09.178
That the lvies love.

39:10.388 --> 39:11.556
Yeah.

39:13.725 --> 39:16.644
- Moonshadows.
- Excuse me?

39:16.728 --> 39:19.772
It's in Malibu. Very romantic.

39:21.065 --> 39:22.150
Thanks.

39:22.483 --> 39:24.110
Is she special?

39:25.737 --> 39:27.697
I don't know. She could be.

39:44.046 --> 39:46.299
Oh boy, this place is a disaster.

39:46.382 --> 39:48.384
This is the way I keep things organized.

39:49.385 --> 39:51.429
You didn't wear this much make-up
in Minneapolis.

39:51.512 --> 39:53.055
I know. It looks hot, doesn't it?

39:53.139 --> 39:55.182
Honey, you don't need a lot of make-up.

39:55.725 --> 39:58.686
Mom, this is Beverly Hills.
You gotta be a little glamorous.

39:59.520 --> 40:02.440
You know, you could borrow
any of my make-up anytime you want.

40:03.733 --> 40:06.360
- So, whose party is it this time?
- I don't know.

40:06.736 --> 40:08.112
Is Kelly driving?

40:08.654 --> 40:10.823
Well, I'll just get the address from her.

40:11.740 --> 40:14.785
You know, parents in Beverly Hills
let their kids go where they want

40:14.869 --> 40:17.496
and do what they want.
They're treated like adults.

40:17.580 --> 40:20.207
Except they're not. You're not.

40:21.959 --> 40:24.753
Look, Mom,
you know that you can trust me.

40:25.754 --> 40:28.340
Fine, fine, I'll give you Kelly's number.

40:29.883 --> 40:31.802
Listen, I want you home by 12:00.
I'm serious.

40:32.052 --> 40:34.305
- 12:45.
- 12:15.

40:48.068 --> 40:49.778
- Hi.
- Hi.

40:50.696 --> 40:51.822
How's it going?

40:57.703 --> 41:00.330
IDs. IDs. Thank you.

41:03.083 --> 41:04.334
Thank you.

41:04.793 --> 41:06.712
Let's see some IDs, ladies.

41:06.795 --> 41:09.798
- Come on, give us a break, okay?
- Give me a break, all right?

41:09.881 --> 41:11.967
- Oh, I'm so sure.
- We were here last week.

41:12.050 --> 41:13.593
Is he serious?

41:15.137 --> 41:16.680
Okay, you in.

41:17.097 --> 41:18.974
- See you guys inside.
- Bye.

41:22.227 --> 41:23.770
- Sorry.
- What?

41:24.646 --> 41:28.442
- Do the addition. I am 21.
- Let's see it again.

41:34.322 --> 41:36.658
This is what they tell me to do
with fake IDs.

41:36.741 --> 41:38.618
You slime.

41:38.827 --> 41:40.912
Come back in about five years.

41:42.122 --> 41:43.873
- Brenda!
- Let's just go, Kelly.

41:43.957 --> 41:45.208
- Come on.
- Come on.

41:45.292 --> 41:46.793
What about Brenda?

42:32.046 --> 42:34.674
- Have you seen them? Blonde...
- No, no, no.

42:34.841 --> 42:36.134
Hey, what's the problem?

42:36.217 --> 42:37.927
- What?
- I didn't see anybody, I'm sorry.

42:38.010 --> 42:40.763
- Relax. I'm not gonna bite.
- I'm sorry.

42:40.972 --> 42:42.682
You just look upset.

42:42.765 --> 42:45.268
Oh, it's just that my friends,
they ditched me.

42:46.185 --> 42:49.730
- Can I buy you a drink or something?
- No, no. I have to call my...

42:49.856 --> 42:51.607
I mean, I have to call a cab
or something.

42:51.691 --> 42:53.609
Oh, come on. One drink.

42:53.901 --> 42:56.612
I'm a nice guy, honest. Come on.

42:56.696 --> 42:58.114
I don't know.

42:58.489 --> 42:59.865
What'll you have?

43:03.661 --> 43:07.039
- Can I get you anything?
- Let's see, I'll have a...

43:07.707 --> 43:08.749
A...

43:09.250 --> 43:10.876
This isn't a trick question.

43:11.001 --> 43:13.838
- A banana daiquiri.
- Interesting choice.

43:14.004 --> 43:15.881
And I'll have a Tanqueray and tonic.

43:17.174 --> 43:19.635
- So, what's your name?
- Brenda.

43:19.718 --> 43:22.263
- Hi, Brenda. I'm Jason.
- Hi.

43:23.514 --> 43:25.891
- Are you in school?
- Yes.

43:26.141 --> 43:28.853
- Oh, where do you go?
- Guess.

43:29.645 --> 43:30.688
SC?

43:31.689 --> 43:33.357
- What, UCLA?
- Right.

43:33.440 --> 43:37.069
- Hey, that's where I went to law school.
- Really?

43:37.236 --> 43:40.072
- So, you're a lawyer?
- Yeah.

43:40.155 --> 43:43.450
Tell me, do you live in a dorm
or in a house?

43:43.742 --> 43:46.120
- A house.
- Which one?

43:47.287 --> 43:50.624
- Which house?
- Yeah, I know all the sororities there.

43:51.708 --> 43:55.712
Oh, well, it's a new one.
We just transferred from Minnesota.

43:56.255 --> 43:58.132
- State?
- Yes.

43:58.632 --> 44:03.220
The whole house just transferred
from Minnesota State to UCLA?

44:04.638 --> 44:05.889
Something like that.

44:07.057 --> 44:08.559
How weird.

44:52.727 --> 44:55.188
Hey, Brandon! You wanna drive?

44:56.314 --> 44:58.441
I don't know.
It's your dad's bike and everything.

44:58.525 --> 45:00.819
- I don't want...
- Oh, come on. You're gonna love it!

46:17.186 --> 46:20.106
You've got a hair.

46:21.148 --> 46:22.942
Actually, I have two.

46:23.651 --> 46:26.195
I've been cultivating them
for about a year now.

46:39.124 --> 46:41.085
I think you're really nice.

46:42.544 --> 46:44.755
I think you're really nice, too.

47:06.735 --> 47:08.403
Let's take off all our clothes.

47:08.487 --> 47:11.949
Whoa, whoa, wait a sec.
Wait a second.

47:12.032 --> 47:13.951
What? What's wrong?

47:15.035 --> 47:19.414
I don't know. I kind of feel like
our roles got a little bit reversed there.

47:19.539 --> 47:23.168
I mean, aren't you supposed
to hold out on me for a little bit?

47:23.251 --> 47:26.296
- Well, why wait? Nobody's stopping us.
- Well, what's the rush?

47:27.631 --> 47:29.883
I'm not going anywhere.

47:32.302 --> 47:34.971
- Sorry.
- No, no, no, don't be.

47:35.931 --> 47:38.850
It's just, I'm having a great time
just being here with you.

47:39.643 --> 47:42.145
- Is that weird?
- No.

47:42.562 --> 47:45.482
It's just that most guys expect
more from me, that's all.

47:45.565 --> 47:48.401
Yeah, well, most guys want
a lot of things they can't get.

47:48.485 --> 47:50.195
Not in this neighborhood.

47:51.571 --> 47:54.866
Wait a minute. Didn't your mother
teach you about playing hard to get?

47:54.950 --> 47:58.244
My mother?
She probably thinks I'm a prude.

47:59.829 --> 48:02.832
- Wait a minute, are you saying...
- Brandon, my dad manages rock bands.

48:02.916 --> 48:05.335
He met my mom on the road,
she was this major groupie.

48:05.418 --> 48:08.421
They did things in the '60s and '70s
that would blow your mind.

48:09.130 --> 48:10.882
They think my life is a bore.

48:12.258 --> 48:14.761
You should spend a couple of weeks
with my parents.

48:15.011 --> 48:17.847
You might feel like you're in
a maximum security penitentiary.

48:17.972 --> 48:21.392
Yeah. It might be a nice break
from this place.

48:24.354 --> 48:26.272
I mean, I feel so trapped sometimes,
you know?

48:26.356 --> 48:27.941
I mean, the minute I wanna go out
and have some fun,

48:28.024 --> 48:29.525
people at school call me a party girl.

48:29.609 --> 48:32.820
And if I wanna be left alone,
or act quiet, they call me stuck up.

48:32.904 --> 48:35.198
I just... I can't win, you know?

48:36.824 --> 48:38.785
- Come here.
- No.

48:39.702 --> 48:41.913
Is that what I'm supposed to be doing?

48:51.589 --> 48:53.966
You're so beautiful.

48:56.928 --> 49:01.140
You know, years from now
I'm gonna look back on this night,

49:02.266 --> 49:05.144
and I'm gonna kick myself
for being such an idiot.

49:05.603 --> 49:09.398
No, you won't. I won't let you.

49:31.420 --> 49:34.590
I'd offer you a drink,
but I'm all out of bananas.

49:37.092 --> 49:40.846
So, you live here all by yourself?

49:42.306 --> 49:45.601
Yeah, all by myself.

49:47.227 --> 49:48.479
How cool.

49:59.073 --> 50:00.240
All right.

50:14.004 --> 50:17.049
Our housemother is really strict
and I have to be home by midnight.

50:17.382 --> 50:21.261
Don't worry, Cinderella.
I only live a few miles from campus.

50:27.809 --> 50:32.105
- Jason, what are you doing?
- Taking our clothes off.

50:32.189 --> 50:35.317
- Jason, Jason, I can't.
- Why not?

50:35.692 --> 50:37.444
Because I can't.

50:41.073 --> 50:44.117
Relax. I can respect that.

50:45.202 --> 50:47.871
I don't want this thing to go
any faster than you do.

50:48.455 --> 50:49.748
Really?

50:51.833 --> 50:56.213
- Sorry.
- There's nothing to be sorry about.

50:57.047 --> 50:58.673
You're very sweet,

51:00.550 --> 51:02.344
and very attractive.

51:03.345 --> 51:07.849
And if you really want to go home,
I'll do it right now.

51:09.726 --> 51:11.186
Thanks.

51:18.777 --> 51:22.155
- This is it. This is the one.
- I think that's a church.

51:22.614 --> 51:24.407
I mean the one next to it.

51:28.369 --> 51:30.955
Well, here's my number.

51:33.499 --> 51:36.085
Are you sure you're not lying
about not having a phone?

51:36.336 --> 51:38.546
- Honest.
- Okay.

51:40.965 --> 51:42.634
I'm sorry you couldn't spend the night.

51:43.968 --> 51:45.678
Yeah, me, too.

51:46.095 --> 51:48.056
So, I'll talk to you soon.

51:49.849 --> 51:53.478
I think you should get a phone.
Communication's important.

51:54.479 --> 51:55.980
I'll work on it.

51:56.731 --> 51:57.774
Good night.

52:38.522 --> 52:41.734
- What are you doing home so late?
- You scared the hell out of me.

52:42.693 --> 52:45.070
- Lost your ride?
- None of your business.

52:45.279 --> 52:48.741
- What are you doing home so late?
- None of your business.

52:50.784 --> 52:52.578
- Don't tell Mom.
- Don't tell Mom.

53:11.930 --> 53:15.976
<i>- Kelly?
- Brenda? It's 6:00 in the morning.</i>

53:16.435 --> 53:18.145
I know.
I haven't been able to sleep all night.

53:18.228 --> 53:21.315
<i>- I had to call you.
- Look, I'm sorry about last night.</i>

53:21.648 --> 53:24.443
That jerk at the door wouldn't even
let us in to find you.

53:24.610 --> 53:26.278
Kelly, you'll never believe
what happened.

53:26.361 --> 53:30.198
- I met a guy after you left.
- No way. Who is he?

53:30.574 --> 53:34.036
His name is Jason, and he's 25,
a lawyer, and so cute.

53:34.202 --> 53:36.079
We had a really great night together.

53:36.163 --> 53:38.415
<i>- You slept with him?
- No.</i>

53:38.498 --> 53:42.335
- Kelly, who is that?
- Just a friend.

53:42.836 --> 53:45.422
Well, what kind of friend
calls in the middle of the night?

53:45.505 --> 53:47.090
She woke up Bob.

53:47.507 --> 53:49.468
Good. It's about time somebody did.

53:50.010 --> 53:51.928
That's all he does around here, is sleep.

53:52.012 --> 53:55.474
Kelly, I will not have you talking to me
about my life like that.

53:55.891 --> 53:57.726
Now, I thought we were mature.

53:57.809 --> 54:01.062
I let you do your thing
and you let me do mine, right?

54:02.063 --> 54:04.733
- Right, Mom.
- Good.

54:04.941 --> 54:07.694
Now, tell whoever it is
you'll call them back in the morning.

54:07.944 --> 54:11.364
I don't like this phone ringing
at 6:00 a.m.

54:11.448 --> 54:12.866
Okay.

54:15.577 --> 54:17.620
- You still there?
- Yeah, what happened?

54:17.954 --> 54:19.789
My mom. It's nothing.

54:20.540 --> 54:22.834
Brenda, does he know
you're in high school?

54:23.084 --> 54:26.796
<i>- I told him I go to UCLA.
- Brenda, I can't believe you.</i>

54:27.297 --> 54:30.383
<i>- Do you think he has a friend?
- I don't know, but I can ask.</i>

54:31.426 --> 54:35.138
- Kelly, what am I gonna do?
- Have a good time.

54:35.722 --> 54:37.307
<i>That's what I always do.</i>

54:38.600 --> 54:39.767
Bye.

54:48.401 --> 54:50.069
Take it easy, guys.

54:50.278 --> 54:54.365
Steve, I saw your car. It's disgusting.

54:55.408 --> 54:57.201
Thanks, Kel.
Thanks for pointing that out.

54:57.285 --> 54:59.370
- I would have never noticed.
- Did you do it,

54:59.454 --> 55:02.623
or was it that dorkmeier
driving you home last Friday?

55:02.999 --> 55:04.500
"Dorkmeier"?

55:07.628 --> 55:10.298
- What dorkmeier?
- I don't know, some geek.

55:10.381 --> 55:12.383
Yeah, well, what did he look like?
What was his name?

55:12.466 --> 55:14.760
You don't remember?
He was driving your car.

55:15.094 --> 55:17.179
No, I don't remember.

55:18.389 --> 55:20.683
Well, whoever he was,
he looked pretty young,

55:20.891 --> 55:22.560
like a freshman.

55:22.810 --> 55:25.104
Probably, didn't even have
his driver's license yet.

55:29.692 --> 55:32.028
I'm gonna find him
and I'm gonna kill him.

55:46.125 --> 55:50.588
Welcome, ladies.
You're just in time for a pop quiz.

55:52.840 --> 55:55.467
Papers will be due
at the end of the movement.

55:58.637 --> 56:02.349
- I hope you know this stuff.
- I haven't studied all week.

56:29.251 --> 56:31.086
What's number two?

56:48.770 --> 56:51.523
Don't be fooled by appearances.

56:52.149 --> 56:54.734
Chemistry, like music, is always tricky,

56:55.318 --> 56:57.320
and never what it seems.

57:24.139 --> 57:26.099
I got some flowers for...

57:38.820 --> 57:39.904
Brandon...

57:48.454 --> 57:52.041
- She says to sign for the flowers, man.
- Oh, okay.

57:55.461 --> 57:56.587
Thanks.

58:17.024 --> 58:18.818
You must be awesome, dude.

58:24.282 --> 58:27.702
No, no, this one first and then that one.
It looks good, you guys.

58:28.744 --> 58:30.204
Really good.

58:32.957 --> 58:34.083
Good.

58:35.418 --> 58:37.878
So, I see your date went well.

58:39.296 --> 58:42.508
Yeah, I guess.
Thanks for the suggestion.

58:46.011 --> 58:48.973
- Frankly, I don't see you two together.
- Why not?

58:49.348 --> 58:52.476
I don't know,
you seem smart and down to earth,

58:52.560 --> 58:54.812
and she's kind of stupid and rich.

58:55.312 --> 58:57.022
See, that's not true at all.

58:57.773 --> 58:59.275
Nobody really knows her.

58:59.858 --> 59:02.403
- Well, what's she like?
- I don't know.

59:04.238 --> 59:07.199
It's like she's got all this money
and all this freedom,

59:07.283 --> 59:10.244
and I think it kind of gets in her way.

59:10.494 --> 59:13.414
See, she's got this image
that's not exactly her.

59:13.998 --> 59:17.251
And then guys go out with her
expecting something,

59:18.544 --> 59:20.129
and she doesn't want to spoil the image,

59:20.212 --> 59:24.883
so she feels obligated
to be this person that she's really not.

59:26.677 --> 59:29.138
Does that make
any sort of sense whatsoever?

59:29.388 --> 59:31.932
Maybe you should be writing
for our advice column.

59:33.392 --> 59:35.269
Thanks anyway. I'm allergic.

59:43.986 --> 59:46.071
Okay, this is his voice.

59:46.405 --> 59:47.990
<i>Hi, it's Jason.</i>

59:48.407 --> 59:50.617
<i>I'm not in right now
to take your call at the moment,</i>

59:50.701 --> 59:52.953
<i>but if you'll leave your name, number
and the time you called,</i>

59:53.036 --> 59:55.372
<i>I'll get back to you just as soon as I can.</i>

59:55.997 --> 59:57.999
<i>Thanks for calling,
and wait for the beep.</i>

59:58.083 --> 59:59.418
Hi, Jason.

59:59.501 --> 01:00:00.794
- Did it beep?
- No.

01:00:00.877 --> 01:00:03.547
- It better not have beeped.
- I swear it didn't beep.

01:00:06.049 --> 01:00:08.510
- I'm gonna call him at work.
- Go for it.

01:00:17.435 --> 01:00:20.605
Jason Croft, please. Brenda Walsh.

01:00:21.398 --> 01:00:22.816
Yes, I can hold.

01:00:26.236 --> 01:00:29.197
50 bucks on this guy's head, people.
If anybody sees him, let me know.

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:30.949
Hey, if you tell me,
I'll go out with you Friday night.

01:00:31.032 --> 01:00:34.160
Hey, hey. Hey. Man, listen to me.

01:00:34.244 --> 01:00:36.704
If you see this guy, let me know.
50 bucks if you...

01:00:36.788 --> 01:00:39.624
Did anybody see this guy who was
driving my Vette the other night?

01:00:39.707 --> 01:00:43.211
Hey, hey, hey, look.

01:00:43.586 --> 01:00:45.463
50 bucks if you help me nail this dude.

01:00:45.547 --> 01:00:47.423
I'm looking for the freshman dork
who was driving my car

01:00:47.507 --> 01:00:49.676
after Marianne Moore's party.

01:00:49.968 --> 01:00:52.053
50 bucks! Big reward!

01:00:53.137 --> 01:00:55.682
You can take off
the hat and sunglasses.

01:00:55.765 --> 01:00:58.393
If he hasn't nailed you by now,
he's never going to.

01:00:58.476 --> 01:01:00.144
- You think?
- Definitely.

01:01:00.228 --> 01:01:01.938
And I want my Lakers hat back.

01:01:02.021 --> 01:01:03.481
You said you were gonna bring it today.

01:01:03.564 --> 01:01:06.776
- Look, I'm sorry. I forgot it.
- I bet you lost it.

01:01:07.193 --> 01:01:10.571
- No, I didn't. I remember where I left it.
- Where?

01:01:12.156 --> 01:01:15.660
- Sanders' Vette.
- David, it had my name sewn into it.

01:01:16.119 --> 01:01:19.747
50 bucks guys,
and I'll let you help me kick his ass.

01:01:22.250 --> 01:01:24.001
I'm history.

01:01:24.585 --> 01:01:27.797
Hey, are you the guy
Marianne sent flowers to?

01:01:27.922 --> 01:01:28.965
Yeah.

01:01:29.048 --> 01:01:30.967
Hey, Robinson, this is the guy.

01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:33.386
Oh, Marianne sent you flowers?

01:01:33.970 --> 01:01:35.888
Well, I wouldn't exactly
call them flowers.

01:01:35.972 --> 01:01:37.682
Hey, look, man,
I wanna know what you did, man.

01:01:37.765 --> 01:01:41.018
You see, I happen to cultivate a very
deep interest in the female species,

01:01:41.102 --> 01:01:43.979
so I wanna know what you did,
where you did it,

01:01:44.063 --> 01:01:46.524
how you did it,
and how you got her to do it.

01:01:48.150 --> 01:01:50.361
Look, Robinson, all I can say is that

01:01:51.362 --> 01:01:53.989
I did something with Marianne
on Saturday

01:01:54.365 --> 01:01:56.242
that most guys probably couldn't handle.

01:01:56.325 --> 01:01:58.410
What's that supposed to mean, man?

01:01:59.286 --> 01:02:00.996
Use your imagination.

01:02:04.333 --> 01:02:07.086
No. No way, man!

01:02:24.311 --> 01:02:28.524
Hey, heard you scored
on Marianne Moore. Congratulations.

01:02:36.156 --> 01:02:39.159
- Heard about you and Marianne.
- From who?

01:02:39.952 --> 01:02:42.496
The whole school is talking about it.

01:02:42.704 --> 01:02:44.831
I'm surprised at you, Brandon.

01:02:45.415 --> 01:02:48.085
Look, you don't know
what you're talking about, all right?

01:02:48.168 --> 01:02:52.339
- Get out of my car.
- It's not your car. Half of it is mine.

01:02:52.464 --> 01:02:53.882
Get out of my half then.

01:02:54.007 --> 01:02:58.970
Hey, hey, hey. We interrupt this song
for a "wild thing", wild thing, report.

01:02:59.096 --> 01:03:01.098
<i>Eric Patton and Lucy Belson.</i>

01:03:01.181 --> 01:03:04.976
<i>John Addison and, yeah, my girl,
Sarah Takamoto.</i>

01:03:05.102 --> 01:03:08.563
And the newest wildest things
at West Beverly High,

01:03:08.855 --> 01:03:11.274
<i>well, come on and go with me, children,</i>

01:03:11.358 --> 01:03:14.528
<i>Brandon Walsh and Marianne Moore.</i>

01:03:14.611 --> 01:03:15.779
<i>... it here first.</i>

01:03:29.668 --> 01:03:33.380
Walsh, I'm in your history class
next period. I wanna hear all about it.

01:04:11.376 --> 01:04:13.002
Hey, Marianne.

01:04:13.878 --> 01:04:15.797
Liar! How can you do that?

01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:17.590
How can you go around
spreading those rumors,

01:04:17.673 --> 01:04:19.425
after I spilled my guts to you like that?

01:04:19.509 --> 01:04:21.636
Hey, I had nothing to do with it, I swear.

01:04:21.719 --> 01:04:23.095
You know,
you're just like everyone else.

01:04:23.179 --> 01:04:25.681
You're like every other creep.
You used me to get a name for yourself.

01:04:25.765 --> 01:04:27.767
Look, Marianne, I didn't...
I didn't say anything.

01:04:27.850 --> 01:04:30.394
Well, then who did, huh?

01:04:30.478 --> 01:04:31.562
Tell me.

01:04:32.730 --> 01:04:35.316
I really thought
I can trust you, Brandon.

01:04:35.650 --> 01:04:38.194
God, do you know what it's like to
not to be able to trust anybody,

01:04:38.277 --> 01:04:40.071
not even your own parents?

01:04:40.196 --> 01:04:44.116
I didn't want anything more from you
than to have a friend in this school.

01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:47.203
- I thought you could've used the same.
- Yeah, I can.

01:04:47.453 --> 01:04:50.664
The funny thing is they wouldn't
have believed the truth, anyway.

01:04:50.748 --> 01:04:54.335
I feel so stupid right now
because I thought you were for real.

01:04:56.003 --> 01:04:57.922
See you at the next big party.

01:04:58.005 --> 01:05:00.382
Who knows,
it'll probably be at my house.

01:05:07.765 --> 01:05:08.974
Thank you, Mr Clayton.

01:05:09.058 --> 01:05:12.186
And I hope you understand,
Sophie's father is one of the most

01:05:12.269 --> 01:05:14.688
respected plastic surgeons
in Beverly Hills,

01:05:14.772 --> 01:05:16.148
so he's a little grade-conscious.

01:05:16.231 --> 01:05:17.733
Not to worry, Mrs Dubois.

01:05:17.816 --> 01:05:20.110
Tell your husband that a B-
is nothing to worry about.

01:05:20.194 --> 01:05:21.487
Thank you.

01:05:22.738 --> 01:05:26.158
- You wanted to see me, Jack?
- Yes, please.

01:05:33.749 --> 01:05:36.794
- Is something wrong?
- Yeah, sort of.

01:05:38.212 --> 01:05:41.423
<i>The non comprender factor
has gone sky-high this year.</i>

01:05:42.424 --> 01:05:44.635
Your students can't understand you.

01:05:47.429 --> 01:05:49.973
See, that's what I'm talking about.

01:05:50.933 --> 01:05:52.434
Look, Jack.

01:05:52.517 --> 01:05:57.022
The only way to learn Spanish,
is to live Spanish, to breathe Spanish,

01:05:57.105 --> 01:06:01.443
to feel Spanish, to touch Spanish.

01:06:05.030 --> 01:06:06.406
I mean, yes.

01:06:06.490 --> 01:06:10.077
If their scores don't improve
within a month, we'll talk again.

01:06:10.619 --> 01:06:13.747
How about Friday night? I mean dinner.

01:06:16.750 --> 01:06:18.210
I'll let you know.

01:06:26.593 --> 01:06:29.095
Go do something,
I don't know, get crazy.

01:06:32.682 --> 01:06:34.768
You, my man, are a legend.

01:06:37.354 --> 01:06:39.397
You know, for once I thought,
here was a nice guy,

01:06:39.481 --> 01:06:42.067
a guy with class,
intelligence, sensitivity.

01:06:42.150 --> 01:06:43.568
But now I think
you're just a gutless wimp

01:06:43.651 --> 01:06:45.278
who probably can't even
write a good lead.

01:06:45.361 --> 01:06:48.698
- All right. Come on, lay off, will you?
- No, I will not lay off.

01:06:48.782 --> 01:06:53.036
There are better ways to get popular
than advertising your sexual conquests.

01:06:53.661 --> 01:06:55.830
Boy, was I wrong about you.

01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:09.969
What'd she say?

01:07:10.053 --> 01:07:11.763
Stupid pig.

01:07:19.687 --> 01:07:21.230
I don't see it. Where is it?

01:07:21.314 --> 01:07:24.317
Come on, it's gotta be in there.
Just keep looking.

01:07:29.197 --> 01:07:30.323
Yes!

01:07:31.991 --> 01:07:33.451
Hurry up, go!

01:07:40.166 --> 01:07:41.334
Busted!

01:07:44.837 --> 01:07:46.547
I... I can't find it!

01:07:46.631 --> 01:07:49.508
- It's gotta be in there.
- I don't see it!

01:07:53.262 --> 01:07:54.597
- Where is it?
- Hurry up!

01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:56.807
- I can't.
- Better hurry up!

01:07:56.891 --> 01:07:58.851
- I can't, it's stuck.
- It's Steve.

01:07:58.934 --> 01:08:00.061
What?

01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:08.068
- You're the guy who drove me home?
- No, no, it wasn't me!

01:08:08.152 --> 01:08:10.529
- I swear it wasn't!
- You've got the wrong guy, jerk!

01:08:10.613 --> 01:08:12.364
I'm the one who drove you home
the other night.

01:08:12.448 --> 01:08:13.824
Remember? We kind of
hung out together.

01:08:13.908 --> 01:08:15.451
I told you I was a fan of your mom's.

01:08:15.534 --> 01:08:18.828
And then I drove you home because you
were too wasted to do it yourself.

01:08:18.912 --> 01:08:21.081
Oh, yeah. You're gonna pay, buddy.

01:08:21.165 --> 01:08:23.125
But you were going to drive drunk, man.
I did you a favor.

01:08:23.459 --> 01:08:24.585
Yeah, so what exactly happened, huh?

01:08:24.667 --> 01:08:27.755
I forgot to put the car in gear.
I'm not used to driving a stick.

01:08:28.839 --> 01:08:29.923
Look, I admit it was my fault.

01:08:30.006 --> 01:08:32.551
I'm probably gonna have to work
in McDonald's for the rest of my life,

01:08:32.634 --> 01:08:35.470
- but I'll pay for it.
- I have insurance, you moron.

01:08:35.554 --> 01:08:38.307
You know, I know this guy in the valley
who works on Vettes real cheap.

01:08:38.390 --> 01:08:40.142
Maybe if you get a good quote
from the insurance company,

01:08:40.225 --> 01:08:41.977
you can make money on this.

01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:43.145
Really?

01:08:43.228 --> 01:08:46.689
Yeah. Then you can buy yourself
some new speakers.

01:08:48.274 --> 01:08:50.277
What's wrong with my speakers?

01:08:50.944 --> 01:08:52.863
I don't know.
I was jamming the music a little loud.

01:08:52.946 --> 01:08:55.490
I think I might have blown out a tweeter.

01:08:57.701 --> 01:08:58.743
Tweeter.

01:09:01.412 --> 01:09:05.000
Oh, what did I do to deserve
meeting a dork like this?

01:09:09.379 --> 01:09:11.173
See you at the next party.

01:09:13.175 --> 01:09:15.969
That is the studliest thing
I have ever seen.

01:09:18.930 --> 01:09:20.182
<i>Hi, I'm Brenda.</i>

01:09:21.099 --> 01:09:22.475
Hi, I'm Brenda.

01:09:24.269 --> 01:09:27.479
Hi, my name is Brenda Walsh.

01:09:28.148 --> 01:09:29.774
I hate my name.

01:09:30.609 --> 01:09:33.486
- Bren, what are you doing?
- Don't you ever knock?

01:09:37.115 --> 01:09:38.366
Can we talk?

01:09:40.660 --> 01:09:42.953
I wanted to ask you
about this rumor that's going around

01:09:43.037 --> 01:09:44.497
about me and Marianne.

01:09:44.581 --> 01:09:48.167
I kind of feel responsible, like
I started it somehow, because...

01:09:49.127 --> 01:09:52.255
Well, because,
I never really denied it, and I...

01:09:55.008 --> 01:09:57.093
Brenda, are you listening to me?

01:09:58.011 --> 01:09:59.262
I'm listening.

01:10:01.848 --> 01:10:03.349
I feel like a jerk.

01:10:05.101 --> 01:10:08.271
- Boy, I am glad you said that.
- Why?

01:10:10.064 --> 01:10:11.608
I would hate to think that you're turning

01:10:11.691 --> 01:10:14.777
into the kind of person
that does start those rumors.

01:10:14.986 --> 01:10:19.657
You know, it might seem cool to guys,
but to a girl that likes you, it really hurts.

01:10:19.782 --> 01:10:21.617
Yeah, tell me about it.

01:10:22.994 --> 01:10:24.370
So what do I do?

01:10:25.913 --> 01:10:28.499
- You'll think of something.
- Great.

01:10:30.752 --> 01:10:32.962
Wait a minute, where are you going?

01:10:33.421 --> 01:10:34.714
I have a date.

01:10:35.173 --> 01:10:37.467
- With who?
- He's older.

01:10:37.717 --> 01:10:40.469
- In college?
- Something like that.

01:10:41.095 --> 01:10:44.473
- Brandon, if you tell Mom, I will kill you.
- Is it serious?

01:10:46.225 --> 01:10:49.312
I don't know. I think it is.

01:10:50.354 --> 01:10:53.357
I mean, I like him so much,
it's kind of scary.

01:10:53.899 --> 01:10:56.527
And my mind, it's like I'm fixated on him.

01:10:56.652 --> 01:10:59.113
Sometimes I think I'm in love,
but I know that's not possible,

01:10:59.196 --> 01:11:00.906
because I just met him.

01:11:01.198 --> 01:11:02.533
Well, who is he?

01:11:02.616 --> 01:11:05.453
Brandon, give me a little time
on this one, okay?

01:11:05.536 --> 01:11:08.539
I promise I'll tell you, soon.

01:11:08.748 --> 01:11:10.624
I hate secrets.

01:11:14.044 --> 01:11:16.422
Hey, listen,
you be careful out there, okay?

01:11:16.881 --> 01:11:19.800
- I'm serious.
- Okay, Dad.

01:11:25.347 --> 01:11:27.308
Brenda, I only made pot roast.

01:11:28.267 --> 01:11:30.728
Didn't I tell you?
I'm going out with some friends tonight.

01:11:30.811 --> 01:11:32.855
On Tuesday night?
Don't you have homework?

01:11:32.938 --> 01:11:34.898
We're studying afterwards.

01:11:35.399 --> 01:11:36.859
Aren't those my shoes?

01:11:36.984 --> 01:11:39.445
Where is all this dinner money
coming from, anyway?

01:11:39.528 --> 01:11:42.364
- Dad, it's just McDonald's.
- In that outfit?

01:11:42.448 --> 01:11:43.741
Mom, this is Beverly Hills.

01:11:43.824 --> 01:11:46.118
Can't I have some friends
without getting the third degree?

01:11:46.201 --> 01:11:47.744
- Home by 10:00.
- 10:30.

01:11:47.828 --> 01:11:49.204
10:15.

01:11:50.789 --> 01:11:53.625
I haven't even seen
a McDonald's around here.

01:11:55.919 --> 01:11:58.380
So, Brenda, what's your major?

01:11:58.463 --> 01:12:01.842
You must get so sick of people
asking you that all the time.

01:12:01.925 --> 01:12:04.970
- What is it anyway?
- Astronomy.

01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:06.430
Wow.

01:12:06.513 --> 01:12:08.307
You didn't tell us
she was a brain, Jason.

01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:09.933
I flunked astronomy.

01:12:10.017 --> 01:12:12.394
I had no idea you were majoring
in astronomy.

01:12:12.477 --> 01:12:14.146
It's so much math.

01:12:15.397 --> 01:12:17.774
How does everyone
like this Santa Milion?

01:12:17.858 --> 01:12:19.484
- It's good.
- Very dry.

01:12:19.568 --> 01:12:24.114
- How do you like it, Brenda?
- Oh, fine.

01:12:26.074 --> 01:12:28.827
You know, I heard that they discovered
another universe, after this one,

01:12:28.910 --> 01:12:31.705
like, some billion light years away,
or something like that.

01:12:31.788 --> 01:12:35.166
- Who cares, Ron?
- Maybe Brenda does. It is her major.

01:12:36.126 --> 01:12:38.587
I mean, what is a black hole, really?

01:12:39.045 --> 01:12:41.214
Yes, please, go ahead and tell us.

01:12:42.132 --> 01:12:43.425
Well...

01:12:45.552 --> 01:12:49.973
I guess the easiest way to explain it,
without a working knowledge of

01:12:51.141 --> 01:12:55.687
fourth dimensional geometry,
is that it's just a hole.

01:12:56.438 --> 01:12:57.689
Just a hole?

01:12:58.064 --> 01:13:01.526
- In space, dummy.
- That's black.

01:13:01.609 --> 01:13:03.528
I still don't get it.

01:13:04.904 --> 01:13:09.784
So, Jason tells us your entire sorority
house transferred here from Minnesota.

01:13:10.702 --> 01:13:14.747
Well, not exactly all of us, actually.
Just five.

01:13:14.956 --> 01:13:18.042
See, Jason, I told you
it wasn't the entire house.

01:13:18.459 --> 01:13:20.295
Well, that's what she said.

01:13:33.516 --> 01:13:36.602
I really have to go, Jason.

01:13:43.693 --> 01:13:44.944
About Friday.

01:13:45.611 --> 01:13:47.488
Plan on spending the night.

01:13:47.572 --> 01:13:49.907
And tell your housemother,
I don't know,

01:13:49.991 --> 01:13:52.743
that you're visiting
your parents for the week.

01:13:53.327 --> 01:13:56.455
- I'll try.
- Try hard.

01:13:56.831 --> 01:13:58.082
Good night.

01:14:14.473 --> 01:14:18.144
<i>Hey, hey, hey, we have a very
special guest in our studio today,</i>

01:14:18.227 --> 01:14:20.146
Mr Brandon Walsh.

01:14:20.771 --> 01:14:22.731
Brandon Walsh is
this week's wild thing, wild thing,

01:14:22.815 --> 01:14:26.110
who just moved
to Beverly Hills from Minneapolis.

01:14:26.193 --> 01:14:28.404
Say hello to our listeners, Brandon.

01:14:28.904 --> 01:14:29.989
Hi.

01:14:30.281 --> 01:14:31.865
So, Brandon, tell us,

01:14:31.949 --> 01:14:35.119
what does it take to be a wild thing?
Wild thing!

01:14:35.411 --> 01:14:38.080
Well, actually, that's what
I wanted to talk to you about today.

01:14:38.163 --> 01:14:39.331
Hold on, hold on.

01:14:39.415 --> 01:14:41.291
Before you say
another word, remember,

01:14:41.375 --> 01:14:44.211
we are regulated by both the FCC

01:14:44.294 --> 01:14:47.339
and Mrs Sibitsky, our club sponsor.

01:14:48.215 --> 01:14:49.466
Right.

01:14:49.550 --> 01:14:53.095
Well, since my date with Marianne
Moore has become public knowledge,

01:14:53.178 --> 01:14:56.140
I wanted to tell everyone
what exactly happened that night.

01:14:56.223 --> 01:14:58.350
<i>What? We are all ears, Brandon.</i>

01:15:00.185 --> 01:15:03.522
<i>Nothing happened,
and a lot of you guys out there know it.</i>

01:15:03.981 --> 01:15:06.692
But, Brandon,
the key phrase here is "wild thing."

01:15:06.775 --> 01:15:10.153
Look, we sat and we talked, that's it.

01:15:10.988 --> 01:15:14.866
And you know, it may sound a lot less
exciting than doing the wild thing,

01:15:14.950 --> 01:15:17.452
but it actually meant a whole lot more.

01:15:18.036 --> 01:15:20.997
So, Marianne, I hope you're listening,

01:15:21.289 --> 01:15:23.875
<i>because I wanna say I'm sorry.</i>

01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:26.837
And the thing that bums me
out the most

01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:29.631
is that you feel like you
can't trust me anymore.

01:15:30.298 --> 01:15:33.135
And that appears to be
all the time we have this morning

01:15:33.218 --> 01:15:36.012
<i>for mushy declarations of love.</i>

01:15:36.555 --> 01:15:38.890
And this is your Flash the Cash D.J.,

01:15:38.974 --> 01:15:42.477
and you're listening to KWBH. See ya!

01:15:53.697 --> 01:15:58.201
With a very few exceptions,
most of you did very well on your quiz.

01:16:14.008 --> 01:16:16.511
Jason wants to go out
again Friday night.

01:16:16.761 --> 01:16:18.805
He wants me to spend the night.

01:16:19.055 --> 01:16:21.057
You've gotta tell him, Brenda.

01:16:21.808 --> 01:16:23.268
What if he freaks?

01:16:23.893 --> 01:16:27.438
Science is about observation, class.

01:16:27.522 --> 01:16:29.941
So, pay attention to the music.

01:16:30.149 --> 01:16:32.694
If you've done your experiment correctly,

01:16:33.152 --> 01:16:36.197
the melonic acid should react
to the potassium iodate

01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:39.826
exactly when the first movement is over.

01:16:40.493 --> 01:16:43.371
If he really loves you,
then it shouldn't matter.

01:16:43.454 --> 01:16:45.331
Do you think you love him?

01:16:46.457 --> 01:16:47.750
I don't know.

01:16:49.752 --> 01:16:53.589
- Enough to sleep with him?
- I don't know.

01:16:55.466 --> 01:16:56.759
I think so.

01:16:58.135 --> 01:17:00.304
Then you've got to tell him, Brenda.

01:17:02.390 --> 01:17:04.558
Very poor showing, girls.

01:17:05.768 --> 01:17:08.104
Also, it's very disconcerting to notice

01:17:08.187 --> 01:17:11.565
that you both share
all the wrong answers in common.

01:17:12.024 --> 01:17:14.568
If I see this
kind of thing happening again,

01:17:14.652 --> 01:17:17.154
it's an automatic F for the year.

01:17:17.405 --> 01:17:19.573
I've taken the liberty
of making an appointment

01:17:19.657 --> 01:17:21.826
for you with Mr Clayton, Brenda.

01:17:22.660 --> 01:17:23.911
Why?

01:17:24.161 --> 01:17:26.789
I've seen your transcripts
from your former high school.

01:17:26.872 --> 01:17:30.501
I expect much more from you
in this class than a D-.

01:17:32.378 --> 01:17:35.005
Now! The music is over!

01:17:35.089 --> 01:17:37.258
The experiment has ended!

01:17:43.722 --> 01:17:45.015
Marianne.

01:17:46.016 --> 01:17:47.226
Hi.

01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:50.771
I heard what you said this morning.

01:17:51.105 --> 01:17:54.316
I made a fool of myself
in front of the entire school.

01:17:54.608 --> 01:17:56.193
I hope so.

01:18:00.197 --> 01:18:03.867
Marianne, I want you to know
that I never meant to hurt you.

01:18:06.620 --> 01:18:09.414
You just saw an opening and took it.

01:18:10.749 --> 01:18:12.542
I never meant to let you get close to me.

01:18:12.626 --> 01:18:14.628
Oh, come on. Don't say that.

01:18:15.587 --> 01:18:18.006
Look, why don't you give me
a second chance?

01:18:18.298 --> 01:18:20.425
Like Friday night?

01:18:23.011 --> 01:18:26.807
No, I think I'm gonna do something
kind of weird this weekend.

01:18:27.766 --> 01:18:30.519
- Like what?
- Stay home.

01:18:30.894 --> 01:18:32.604
It's a rare event.

01:18:33.647 --> 01:18:35.357
It sounds like a good idea.

01:18:36.525 --> 01:18:38.318
Well, what about the week after?

01:18:40.654 --> 01:18:42.155
I'll call you.

01:18:45.867 --> 01:18:49.037
Great. She'll call me.

01:19:00.882 --> 01:19:02.509
I don't get it, Brenda.

01:19:03.009 --> 01:19:05.387
You've never even gotten a C before.

01:19:06.679 --> 01:19:09.808
- What's up?
- Nothing.

01:19:11.017 --> 01:19:14.395
Brenda, when I see a good student
come to my school and slip,

01:19:14.479 --> 01:19:15.980
I feel responsible.

01:19:16.272 --> 01:19:19.275
- What can I do to help you?
- Nothing.

01:19:19.943 --> 01:19:21.236
Brenda, from the look of things,

01:19:21.319 --> 01:19:23.780
you'll be lucky to pass
chemistry this semester.

01:19:23.863 --> 01:19:26.532
That's not gonna look good
on your record.

01:19:28.284 --> 01:19:30.912
I know. I'll work harder.

01:19:30.995 --> 01:19:32.789
Good girl, and I know you will.

01:19:39.879 --> 01:19:40.963
What's this?

01:19:41.047 --> 01:19:44.133
Have one of your parents sign that
and bring it back to me.

01:19:44.217 --> 01:19:45.385
Why?

01:19:45.468 --> 01:19:47.887
Because something's going on
with you, Brenda,

01:19:47.970 --> 01:19:51.808
and I wanna make damn certain
you're talking to somebody about it.

01:19:58.648 --> 01:20:00.024
Hey, Andrea!

01:20:02.735 --> 01:20:04.737
Didn't you listen to KWBH this morning?

01:20:04.820 --> 01:20:07.281
I never listen to KWBH.

01:20:07.365 --> 01:20:10.242
So, you didn't hear what I said?
About Marianne?

01:20:10.326 --> 01:20:12.536
No, and frankly, I'm not interested.

01:20:12.620 --> 01:20:15.581
- Look, I want to explain something.
- I gotta get home, okay?

01:20:15.665 --> 01:20:18.334
- Well, let me give you a ride, then.
- No. Thank you.

01:21:56.097 --> 01:21:57.891
I can't believe you followed me home.

01:21:57.974 --> 01:22:00.310
It was the only way
I could get to talk to you.

01:22:01.728 --> 01:22:03.730
Wait a minute,
how come you go to West Beverly High?

01:22:03.813 --> 01:22:05.690
You don't live anywhere
near Beverly Hills.

01:22:05.774 --> 01:22:07.275
Look, my life is private, okay?

01:22:07.359 --> 01:22:09.611
How dare you come
anywhere near my house?

01:22:09.694 --> 01:22:12.030
- Hey, I just wanted to talk.
- Oh, yeah, right.

01:22:12.113 --> 01:22:14.199
So you can go blabbing
to everybody about where I live,

01:22:14.282 --> 01:22:16.785
just like you did about you
and Marianne Moore?

01:22:16.868 --> 01:22:19.871
Brandon, this isn't a game to me.
I am not rich like you.

01:22:19.954 --> 01:22:21.664
If anybody finds out where I live,

01:22:21.748 --> 01:22:25.543
they will kick me out of West
Beverly High so fast my head will spin.

01:22:27.128 --> 01:22:29.756
Well, how come you go there
if you live here?

01:22:31.925 --> 01:22:34.385
Because it's the best school
in the city, that's why.

01:22:34.469 --> 01:22:36.429
Why should I be deprived
of a good education

01:22:36.512 --> 01:22:39.390
just because
I am geographically undesirable?

01:22:39.682 --> 01:22:42.310
Well, you're right, you shouldn't.

01:22:44.145 --> 01:22:45.271
Listen.

01:22:45.355 --> 01:22:46.606
The reason I followed you home

01:22:46.689 --> 01:22:49.150
was to tell you that
I think you've got me all wrong.

01:22:49.233 --> 01:22:51.861
That thing about me
and Marianne, that's not me,

01:22:51.944 --> 01:22:53.362
that's not what I'm about.

01:22:53.446 --> 01:22:56.908
I mean, I'm not perfect,
but I'm not a complete jerk either.

01:23:00.953 --> 01:23:04.707
Brandon, I lie about my home address.

01:23:06.876 --> 01:23:08.211
My grandmother lives in a cheap,

01:23:08.294 --> 01:23:10.046
rent-controlled apartment
in Beverly Hills,

01:23:10.129 --> 01:23:12.465
and that's where I have my mail sent.

01:23:13.841 --> 01:23:14.926
If anybody finds out,

01:23:15.009 --> 01:23:17.803
and if you tell anybody
about where I live,

01:23:18.638 --> 01:23:20.222
it'll mess me up bad.

01:23:22.099 --> 01:23:24.977
Don't worry, I won't.

01:23:31.525 --> 01:23:34.612
It's nice to finally bring
a friend home from school.

01:23:35.404 --> 01:23:36.739
Come on in.

01:23:52.379 --> 01:23:54.590
Jason, this place is really nice.

01:23:55.299 --> 01:23:57.843
For the money it's costing, it should be.

01:23:58.302 --> 01:24:00.471
It's worth it, to be here with you.

01:24:00.929 --> 01:24:02.264
Thanks.

01:24:03.432 --> 01:24:05.768
- Can I tell you something?
- Sure.

01:24:06.143 --> 01:24:08.187
The last woman I went
on three dates with,

01:24:08.270 --> 01:24:10.105
I lived with for 11 months.

01:24:11.482 --> 01:24:14.526
- What happened?
- Oh, I don't know.

01:24:14.860 --> 01:24:17.529
Oh, yeah, it was coming up
to our year anniversary.

01:24:17.613 --> 01:24:18.739
We...

01:24:18.822 --> 01:24:22.284
We got into this weird fight
about a new couch for the living room.

01:24:22.367 --> 01:24:24.953
I decided I had to go with my own taste,

01:24:25.037 --> 01:24:28.999
'cause the couch was probably
gonna be around longer than she was.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:33.211
- I don't mean to get heavy on you.
- No, that's okay.

01:24:35.464 --> 01:24:37.758
Jason, do you think
I could tell you anything?

01:24:37.841 --> 01:24:38.967
Of course.

01:24:39.051 --> 01:24:41.094
The older I get, the more I realize

01:24:41.178 --> 01:24:44.306
openness is the most important part
of a relationship.

01:24:45.474 --> 01:24:48.351
And you'd feel
the same way, no matter what?

01:24:48.518 --> 01:24:52.147
I mean, this could be a shock.

01:24:52.272 --> 01:24:56.359
Trust me. I'm shockproof.
Brenda, what is it?

01:24:57.861 --> 01:25:00.155
First of all,
I want you to have my phone number.

01:25:00.238 --> 01:25:02.991
- You got a phone.
- No.

01:25:03.491 --> 01:25:05.201
I've always had a phone.

01:25:06.828 --> 01:25:09.080
I don't live in that sorority house.

01:25:10.081 --> 01:25:11.124
No?

01:25:12.459 --> 01:25:15.837
- I don't go to college.
- You work?

01:25:19.382 --> 01:25:23.344
Jason, I am a junior
at West Beverly High.

01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:29.434
- What kind of a junior?
- A 16-year-old junior.

01:25:30.435 --> 01:25:33.062
Look, my best friend, Kelly, told me
that if we were getting serious,

01:25:33.146 --> 01:25:34.314
I had to tell you the truth,

01:25:34.397 --> 01:25:37.317
and that if you really loved me,
it wouldn't matter anyway.

01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:39.485
Oh, is that what Kelly said?

01:25:40.153 --> 01:25:42.155
I thought you were shockproof.

01:25:43.197 --> 01:25:44.616
More wine?

01:25:45.491 --> 01:25:47.535
Maybe you should check her ID.

01:25:48.411 --> 01:25:50.163
Or is that fake, too?

01:25:56.210 --> 01:25:58.129
How could you do this to me?

01:26:00.214 --> 01:26:02.216
What is this,
some kind of a high school prank?

01:26:02.300 --> 01:26:03.801
Jason, I'm sorry.

01:26:04.093 --> 01:26:06.637
- Look, I thought...
- You thought wrong.

01:26:08.639 --> 01:26:10.391
I should sue your parents.

01:26:13.269 --> 01:26:14.520
Yes.

01:26:15.187 --> 01:26:17.732
Excuse me. Bring me the check.

01:26:52.266 --> 01:26:53.893
Turn left here.

01:26:55.311 --> 01:26:56.395
No.

01:26:56.478 --> 01:26:59.315
Tell me, Brenda,
was it fun playing grownup?

01:27:02.192 --> 01:27:04.153
My feelings for you didn't change

01:27:04.236 --> 01:27:07.406
just because I'm a few years younger
than you thought I was.

01:27:08.115 --> 01:27:09.700
What the hell
do you know about feelings?

01:27:09.783 --> 01:27:10.993
A lot!

01:27:11.869 --> 01:27:13.579
I would never tell anyone I liked them

01:27:13.662 --> 01:27:15.622
and then treat them the way
that you're treating me.

01:27:15.706 --> 01:27:19.376
Just wait until somebody you thought
you cared about lies to you.

01:27:20.919 --> 01:27:24.047
You know, don't you think
it was hard on me, too, Jason?

01:27:24.464 --> 01:27:26.758
Lying to my family about
where I was going at night,

01:27:26.842 --> 01:27:28.886
flunking out of school.

01:27:28.969 --> 01:27:30.470
All for what?

01:27:31.221 --> 01:27:33.724
God, I can't believe it.
I was gonna sleep with you tonight.

01:27:33.807 --> 01:27:36.143
You were gonna be the first guy...

01:27:38.270 --> 01:27:39.980
Never mind.

01:27:48.196 --> 01:27:49.906
- Brenda...
- No, just get off me.

01:27:49.990 --> 01:27:51.741
- I'm glad this happened.
- Let me walk you to the door.

01:27:51.825 --> 01:27:54.995
No, just leave me alone!
I never wanna see you again!

01:28:02.794 --> 01:28:05.755
- Mom, I'm so sorry.
- Oh, baby.

01:28:05.839 --> 01:28:07.674
It's all right, honey.

01:28:08.049 --> 01:28:09.092
Oh.

01:28:10.885 --> 01:28:13.972
Sweetie. It's okay.

01:28:14.139 --> 01:28:16.057
I know. I know.

01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:23.064
- I never meant to lie to you.
- I know you didn't, honey. I know.

01:28:27.277 --> 01:28:29.112
Who is he, Brenda?

01:28:30.655 --> 01:28:34.325
Some guy. Kelly and I went to a club...

01:28:34.450 --> 01:28:36.870
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

01:28:37.495 --> 01:28:39.747
It's my fault, too. I just...

01:28:39.831 --> 01:28:42.375
I knew things weren't right, and I just...

01:28:42.792 --> 01:28:46.588
Oh, I wanted you
to be happy here, to fit in,

01:28:46.671 --> 01:28:49.424
but not like this.

01:28:50.383 --> 01:28:51.718
I know.

01:28:52.969 --> 01:28:55.513
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

01:28:58.016 --> 01:29:01.477
- What's going on? What's wrong?
- Nothing.

01:29:03.312 --> 01:29:05.022
Do you guys mind if I talk
about this later?

01:29:05.106 --> 01:29:07.066
I have a lot of catching up
to do on my chemistry.

01:29:07.150 --> 01:29:08.776
- No.
- Okay.

01:29:18.786 --> 01:29:21.122
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:29:28.838 --> 01:29:31.048
So are you gonna
tell me what happened?

01:29:31.132 --> 01:29:33.217
It's a long story.

01:29:33.718 --> 01:29:35.428
I'm not going anywhere.

01:29:35.970 --> 01:29:39.181
Brandon, do you mind
if I save it for when you're older?

01:29:39.306 --> 01:29:40.891
What do you mean? I am older.

01:29:40.975 --> 01:29:42.893
- By 30 seconds, remember?
- I know.

01:29:42.977 --> 01:29:46.272
It's just, when you get to be our age,
girls are more mature.

01:29:49.024 --> 01:29:52.111
- Well, if that's the way you want it.
- Thanks.

01:29:52.403 --> 01:29:55.155
And someday,
I will tell you almost everything.

01:29:55.614 --> 01:29:58.617
Forget it. I've already lost interest.

01:30:03.330 --> 01:30:04.832
I miss Minneapolis.

01:30:07.418 --> 01:30:10.170
- No, you don't.
- Yeah, I do.

01:30:11.964 --> 01:30:13.966
Nothing was this complicated.

01:30:20.931 --> 01:30:24.768
- Brenda, did you...
- No.

01:30:28.438 --> 01:30:29.898
Did you?

01:30:32.734 --> 01:30:34.069
No.

01:30:34.778 --> 01:30:37.322
I didn't think so.

01:30:43.370 --> 01:30:45.747
Brandon, are we gonna make it here?

01:30:46.206 --> 01:30:50.001
Well, the houses are bigger,
the weather is warmer,

01:30:50.836 --> 01:30:53.046
and the tan lines are outstanding,

01:30:54.339 --> 01:30:56.716
but that doesn't mean they've cracked
the meaning of life.

01:30:56.800 --> 01:30:59.428
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah, I know.

01:31:02.973 --> 01:31:05.350
Would you have told me if you did?

01:31:06.305 --> 01:31:12.409
