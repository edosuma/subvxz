WEBVTT

01:00.659 --> 01:01.822
Clear.

01:03.203 --> 01:04.447
Clear.

01:05.706 --> 01:07.010
Is this place what I think it is?

01:07.034 --> 01:09.200
Everybody's dirty little secrets.

01:09.877 --> 01:12.628
Including Taylor A, whoever he is.

01:13.630 --> 01:15.266
Document boxes.

01:15.290 --> 01:17.873
Alphabetical by surname and initial.

01:18.927 --> 01:21.003
Must be hundreds of them.

01:21.471 --> 01:23.713
Lots of big names.

01:24.141 --> 01:27.177
We're gonna need
the code number one angle grinder.

01:32.065 --> 01:33.204
Damn.

01:33.228 --> 01:35.701
What? You think someone
who makes a fortune

01:35.725 --> 01:37.979
buying and selling information
is gonna make it easy?

01:38.238 --> 01:39.780
We're gonna need Eric.

01:45.871 --> 01:46.871
G.

01:56.256 --> 01:59.341
See if they've got one on you
or Hetty.

02:16.109 --> 02:18.647
Nothing on me. Two boxes on Hetty.

02:22.866 --> 02:23.897
Guys.

02:26.203 --> 02:27.745
You're gonna wanna see this.

02:30.624 --> 02:33.329
File burn. It must be automatically
erasing the hard drives.

02:33.627 --> 02:35.869
It's not gonna affect
the hard copy files.

02:36.755 --> 02:38.333
Unless...

02:38.757 --> 02:40.299
We gotta get out of here now.

02:41.468 --> 02:43.069
- Move.
- Oh, that kind of burn.

02:43.093 --> 02:46.013
Okay. Okay. I got it.

02:48.225 --> 02:49.304
G, come on.

02:52.104 --> 02:53.183
G, come on!

03:23.510 --> 03:25.918
Okay.
We'll send you everything we've got.

03:29.766 --> 03:31.842
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

03:33.729 --> 03:34.927
After you powered up,

03:35.814 --> 03:37.012
what did you press?

03:37.441 --> 03:40.442
Nothing.
I didn't even touch the keyboard.

03:42.487 --> 03:45.572
- Maybe we triggered motion detectors.
- I didn't see that.

03:46.116 --> 03:47.361
And I was looking.

03:48.160 --> 03:50.424
Okay. Uh, a timer.

03:50.448 --> 03:52.885
If Keelson's not back
by a certain time, boom.

03:52.909 --> 03:54.362
And if he's stuck in traffic?

03:56.877 --> 04:00.412
Cell phone. Dials up,
punches in the code, deactivates it.

04:02.090 --> 04:04.083
I didn't do anything.

04:08.513 --> 04:11.265
If he could turn it off with a cell phone,
he could turn it on.

04:13.143 --> 04:15.385
Maybe Keelson isn't the lone wolf
we thought he was.

04:25.405 --> 04:28.548
Eric is gonna see what he can dig up
on Keelson's warehouse.

04:28.572 --> 04:31.174
Phone records, utilities,
all the usuals.

04:31.198 --> 04:33.742
Try to turn up another name.

04:38.543 --> 04:39.623
Are we good?

04:40.128 --> 04:41.504
Yeah.

04:42.255 --> 04:43.287
Yeah, sorry.

04:44.049 --> 04:46.042
This is the file he was working on.

04:54.351 --> 04:55.382
Surveillance.

04:55.977 --> 04:57.827
They're arguing.

04:57.851 --> 04:59.219
Probably married.

05:00.607 --> 05:02.351
Taylor.

05:02.693 --> 05:04.436
I wonder
what his dirty little secret is.

05:09.199 --> 05:10.206
Great.

05:10.230 --> 05:12.792
Four hundred and fifty-eight Taylors
in Los Angeles alone.

05:12.816 --> 05:15.034
We're gonna need a first name to...

05:19.209 --> 05:21.036
This is where he got the addresses.

05:22.129 --> 05:23.350
What addresses?

05:23.374 --> 05:26.002
Every foster home I ever lived in.

05:27.551 --> 05:29.590
Keelson gave me a printout,

05:29.886 --> 05:31.926
but this is where he got them.
They're...

05:32.806 --> 05:34.265
They're all handwritten.

05:34.683 --> 05:36.391
What's it doing in this file box?

05:38.395 --> 05:39.402
Well, uh...

05:39.426 --> 05:41.656
Left in a hurry,
could've put them there by mistake.

05:41.680 --> 05:44.015
Keelson didn't make mistakes.

05:44.985 --> 05:49.290
There's five more addresses here
in the back. I don't know any of them.

05:49.314 --> 05:51.375
Maybe this is our connection
with Taylor.

05:51.399 --> 05:54.113
Any of those five new addresses
located in the 6000 block?

05:56.538 --> 05:59.052
- No.
- We find a Bart Smart located

05:59.076 --> 06:01.740
on the 6000 block, at least
we got a place to start looking.

06:02.586 --> 06:06.013
Bart Smart, 67 stores
in greater Los Angeles,

06:06.037 --> 06:08.587
but only one on a 6000 block.

06:10.927 --> 06:13.691
6464 Woodman Avenue, Van Nuys.

06:13.715 --> 06:15.928
That's the apartment block
from the photo.

06:16.808 --> 06:19.679
List the tenants, Eric.
Looking for Taylor, initial A.

06:21.646 --> 06:24.244
- Close.
- Data search on Steven John Taylor.

06:24.268 --> 06:25.769
Same address.

06:29.488 --> 06:33.413
Steven John Taylor, age 45.
No criminal record, divorced.

06:33.437 --> 06:35.194
Ex-wife's name is Amy.

06:35.452 --> 06:38.239
A. Taylor. He's a she.

06:39.539 --> 06:44.142
Age 42, no children,
no current address listed.

06:44.166 --> 06:46.494
Still using her married name.
That's unusual.

06:47.089 --> 06:48.547
What's her maiden name?

06:49.007 --> 06:52.127
Gonna have to go right back
to the marriage certificate.

06:53.637 --> 06:56.128
And her maiden name is...

07:00.769 --> 07:01.884
Callen.

07:16.542 --> 07:19.436
Mr. Hanna, Miss Blye.
Taylor's apartment.

07:19.460 --> 07:22.795
- Mr. Callen, my office.
- Hetty.

07:28.054 --> 07:29.382
Go.

07:40.816 --> 07:45.525
I much prefer a good HB to a BIC.

07:45.821 --> 07:49.498
Press firmly enough
and people don't have to read

07:49.522 --> 07:51.740
between the lines
to get the message.

07:53.496 --> 07:55.511
The answer is no, Mr. Callen.

07:55.535 --> 07:58.968
Hetty, you don't even know
what the question is.

07:58.992 --> 08:01.077
It's no to all of them.

08:02.463 --> 08:06.295
Is there any mention of this
in your classified file? No.

08:06.884 --> 08:09.434
Was I aware you had a relative? No.

08:09.458 --> 08:11.321
Am I surprised? No.

08:11.345 --> 08:12.925
Should you stay on this case?

08:14.558 --> 08:16.516
Definitely no.

08:17.937 --> 08:21.140
Is there any possibility
that this is a coincidence?

08:22.024 --> 08:23.542
Keelson didn't think so.

08:23.566 --> 08:25.335
He had my details in her file.

08:25.359 --> 08:26.726
But he could be wrong.

08:27.029 --> 08:28.499
Could be.

08:28.523 --> 08:31.081
I'm sorry, Mr. Callen.
You know the rules.

08:31.105 --> 08:34.047
It would seem
that while Keelson is dead,

08:34.071 --> 08:36.048
there is still the possibility

08:36.072 --> 08:40.054
that your true identity
may have been compromised

08:40.078 --> 08:42.765
along with the integrity of this unit.

08:42.789 --> 08:45.369
This is the second time
you've taken me off the Keelson case.

08:46.549 --> 08:48.506
Let's make it the last.

08:49.218 --> 08:51.009
Should I read something
between the lines?

09:02.356 --> 09:05.891
Oh, bugger.

09:12.074 --> 09:13.758
Hetty is about to tell you
I'm off the case.

09:13.782 --> 09:17.154
- She is?
- Before she does, what have we got?

09:17.830 --> 09:18.861
Well, I'm...

09:27.673 --> 09:29.084
Okay.

09:29.634 --> 09:31.401
The warehouse is owned
by some corporation

09:31.425 --> 09:32.601
registered in Nevada.

09:32.625 --> 09:34.606
I'm still checking names
and the paperwork,

09:34.630 --> 09:37.213
but they're all paralegals
three times removed from Keelson.

09:40.102 --> 09:41.738
You know,
she could be on her way up.

09:41.762 --> 09:44.475
She will try calling again first.
What else?

09:46.067 --> 09:49.162
Um, okay.
So I checked phone companies.

09:49.186 --> 09:51.496
Phone lines
in and out of the warehouse.

09:51.520 --> 09:54.947
And I found a dedicated data line.
Like a fax line, but here's the thing.

09:58.621 --> 10:00.080
What is the thing, Eric?

10:01.624 --> 10:03.332
Um, it's never had a call.

10:03.668 --> 10:06.598
Ever. The only charge on the phone bill
is for the line rental.

10:06.622 --> 10:09.962
No calls in, no calls out.
Except for one. This morning.

10:10.216 --> 10:12.671
Someone dialled in
to trigger the explosives.

10:12.968 --> 10:14.604
Yeah. Ten-second call.

10:14.628 --> 10:16.772
So I figured if it were me,
I'd wanna be close by

10:16.796 --> 10:18.135
to make sure it all works.

10:21.560 --> 10:23.410
Time-stamp video
puts him on the scene

10:23.434 --> 10:26.830
30 seconds before the blast
with a clear view of the warehouse.

10:26.854 --> 10:28.744
That's how I narrowed down
the search.

10:28.768 --> 10:29.998
Okay, so he makes the call

10:30.022 --> 10:32.626
and we see a change in the light
on the left of the frame

10:32.650 --> 10:33.853
as the building goes up.

10:34.156 --> 10:36.172
He stayed another 30 seconds
and then left.

10:36.196 --> 10:39.463
Not your typical reaction of someone
witnessing a building exploding.

10:39.487 --> 10:40.717
Did you get his cell phone?

10:40.741 --> 10:43.831
Still trying to get it,
but I did get a licence plate.

10:47.086 --> 10:49.304
That's the number, the address,
the guy. Carl Browning.

10:49.328 --> 10:51.663
Rap sheet. Grand theft auto, burglary,
assault, fraud.

10:52.842 --> 10:54.810
- This is Eric.
- What in the world takes you

10:54.834 --> 10:57.050
- so long to answer the phone?
- Hetty.

10:59.265 --> 11:01.399
Taylor has got
some noisy neighbours.

11:01.423 --> 11:05.515
Well, looks like the neighbours
have got a noisy Taylor.

11:07.648 --> 11:09.973
- Is that?
- Yeah. It's Mighty Mouse.

11:11.360 --> 11:12.961
Huh. I was thinking Tom and Jerry.

11:12.985 --> 11:14.707
No, no. It's the mouse.

11:14.731 --> 11:16.945
Oh, no, you don't!

11:17.575 --> 11:19.128
Taylor hasn't got kids.

11:19.152 --> 11:20.631
So what?

11:20.655 --> 11:21.835
Cartoons?

11:21.859 --> 11:23.781
Hmm. Not cartoons.

11:24.081 --> 11:25.196
The mouse.

11:29.920 --> 11:31.854
Now, to save Mousehill from those...

11:31.878 --> 11:33.791
- Clear.
- Clear.

11:34.592 --> 11:37.379
Bedroom and bathroom
look a lot like this.

11:38.345 --> 11:39.602
The whole place is trashed.

11:39.626 --> 11:41.597
They turned the TV up
to mask the sound.

11:44.018 --> 11:45.892
Searching for something.

11:46.103 --> 11:48.060
- I'm guessing they didn't find it.
- Hmm.

11:51.942 --> 11:52.950
Eric.

11:52.974 --> 11:54.670
Sam, Callen's got the information.

11:54.694 --> 11:57.435
- He's on his way to Browning's house.
- What's the address?

12:24.600 --> 12:26.557
Put your hands
where I can see them.

12:27.144 --> 12:28.603
Federal agent.

12:28.979 --> 12:30.687
- You alone?
- No.

12:31.816 --> 12:34.283
As a matter of fact, he's not,

12:34.307 --> 12:36.774
Special Agent G. Callen.

12:38.114 --> 12:39.145
Kort.

12:39.448 --> 12:41.631
You know, Callen,
you're not missing anything.

12:41.655 --> 12:43.841
No one ever calls me
by my first name.

12:43.865 --> 12:45.910
That's because no one likes you.

12:47.456 --> 12:49.341
The CIA do this?

12:49.365 --> 12:51.759
We were late to the party like you.

12:51.783 --> 12:55.519
The place was already trashed.
Television blaring.

12:55.543 --> 12:59.795
And like you, we wanted to have a chat
with Mr. Browning.

13:00.928 --> 13:06.717
Unfortunately for both of us,
Mr. Browning is done chatting.

13:38.306 --> 13:40.761
Browning worked for Keelson.

13:40.975 --> 13:43.240
- Keelson's dead.
- Yeah, I got the memo.

13:43.264 --> 13:46.472
Tell me, did he have a file on you?

13:46.939 --> 13:49.406
No. But he did have one on you.

13:49.430 --> 13:52.455
Hmm. Ashes in the wind.

13:52.479 --> 13:55.796
Scuttlebutt said
you triggered the explosion.

13:55.820 --> 13:58.030
Browning phoned it in.

13:59.285 --> 14:02.072
That's how you found him.
Phone logs.

14:06.459 --> 14:08.119
How did you find him?

14:09.170 --> 14:11.495
Your backup just arrived.

14:12.173 --> 14:14.640
A little late to be of much use,
I would've thought.

14:14.664 --> 14:17.962
I mean,
if we weren't on the same side...

14:19.847 --> 14:21.401
Sam, Kensi.

14:21.425 --> 14:23.805
Trent Kort. He's with the Agency.

14:24.143 --> 14:27.393
We used to work together,
Callen and I.

14:28.356 --> 14:30.598
Kort was just gonna explain
how they knew about Browning.

14:34.862 --> 14:39.334
We've been keeping tabs
on an Iranian, Karim Akbari.

14:39.358 --> 14:40.541
He led us here.

14:40.565 --> 14:44.361
Why is the CIA interested
in Karim Akbari?

14:46.541 --> 14:48.165
Sorry. Classified.

14:49.669 --> 14:51.472
The crime scene is yours, Callen.

14:51.496 --> 14:53.580
Let me know if you find anything.

14:54.966 --> 14:56.875
- You too.
- Kort.

14:58.511 --> 15:00.526
- Crime scene?
- Browning.

15:00.550 --> 15:03.010
Someone decided to make him
the light fixture in the room.

15:03.641 --> 15:05.717
- Akbari.
- Maybe.

15:06.519 --> 15:08.155
So why did Kort give up Akbari?

15:08.179 --> 15:10.596
To see how we'd react
if we're chasing the same guy.

15:12.066 --> 15:13.893
I guess we are now.

15:17.155 --> 15:18.186
Did you find her?

15:18.447 --> 15:21.401
No one home.
The place was turned over. Pros.

15:21.742 --> 15:22.774
TV on?

15:23.619 --> 15:25.529
- Mighty Mouse.
- Woody.

15:26.372 --> 15:28.305
Hmm. Same pros.

15:28.329 --> 15:30.373
Call Eric.
See what he knows about Akbari.

15:32.420 --> 15:33.700
Hetty took me off the case.

15:41.762 --> 15:44.490
- Sam.
- Eric, full-court press.

15:44.514 --> 15:46.722
Karim Akbari, Iranian.

15:48.519 --> 15:49.693
Got him.

15:49.717 --> 15:51.995
But only for a second.

15:52.019 --> 15:54.158
- The file just got locked down.
- By whom?

15:54.182 --> 15:55.734
Our friends at Langley.

15:56.736 --> 15:57.767
Kort just shut us out.

16:11.292 --> 16:12.810
I'd send you home,

16:12.834 --> 16:18.245
but I know that would just move you
from that chair onto that sofa.

16:18.799 --> 16:20.757
I'm still looking for a place.

16:21.469 --> 16:24.861
I just got
a rather officious phone call

16:24.885 --> 16:30.073
from a mid-level time-card puncher
at the CIA.

16:30.097 --> 16:34.539
He wanted to know
why we had requested access

16:34.563 --> 16:38.159
to a classified file
of an ongoing operation.

16:38.183 --> 16:42.145
Have you ever heard of, um,
Karim Akbari?

16:43.115 --> 16:44.918
I don't know anything about him.

16:44.942 --> 16:48.202
That's not what I asked, Mr. Callen.

16:48.955 --> 16:50.117
That was me, Hetty.

16:50.539 --> 16:53.053
Akbari was given to us
by a CIA operative.

16:53.077 --> 16:55.788
I got Eric to run it
and we got red flagged.

16:56.170 --> 16:58.293
Sounds like the CIA
is stonewalling us.

16:59.006 --> 17:01.793
I know a lot about stonewalling.

17:04.845 --> 17:08.071
After I finished
with the, uh, time-card puncher,

17:08.096 --> 17:10.530
I called the director of the CIA

17:10.554 --> 17:15.934
who offered to brief us
on Karim Akbari.

17:16.357 --> 17:19.061
The agent's name is Trent Kort.

17:25.366 --> 17:29.031
Sam and Kensi,
boathouse in a half hour.

17:30.371 --> 17:32.364
She knows. You can't go.

17:38.004 --> 17:40.245
- Where are you going?
- Shoot someone.

17:52.018 --> 17:53.428
Well, I think you killed him.

17:54.312 --> 17:56.304
And his entire extended family.

17:57.732 --> 17:58.787
You wanted to see me?

17:58.811 --> 18:02.019
No. You said you wanted to see me.

18:03.070 --> 18:05.418
You're our operational psychologist,
Nate.

18:05.442 --> 18:07.654
I've got some personal stuff
going on in my life,

18:08.075 --> 18:09.949
so you have to see me.

18:10.244 --> 18:11.275
That's your job.

18:13.914 --> 18:15.764
I'm missing something, aren't I?

18:15.788 --> 18:17.345
What to tell Hetty when she asks.

18:17.369 --> 18:18.894
Okay, what's Hetty going to ask me?

18:18.918 --> 18:21.624
- Why you came to see me.
- And the real reason is?

18:29.889 --> 18:31.739
Shouldn't this be
in the evidence locker?

18:31.763 --> 18:35.384
Aren't we breaking,
like, the chain of evidence or?

18:38.981 --> 18:42.315
You're off the case,
but you need to know the...

18:45.738 --> 18:47.042
Could I go to jail?

18:47.066 --> 18:49.647
- Have you done something wrong?
- I think I'm about to.

18:53.287 --> 18:55.196
I could do
some handwriting analysis.

18:57.124 --> 18:58.916
Do you recognise
any of these addresses?

18:59.460 --> 19:01.583
It's every orphanage and foster home
I ever stayed at.

19:02.630 --> 19:04.955
And these five addresses
at the back?

19:05.466 --> 19:06.466
No.

19:08.427 --> 19:09.684
I could run a search

19:09.708 --> 19:11.465
and see
if they have anything in common.

19:15.059 --> 19:18.973
In fact, I could do it right here.

19:22.942 --> 19:25.694
And you could just happen

19:26.654 --> 19:31.043
to look over my shoulder
if you wanted to.

19:31.067 --> 19:34.942
Because how would I even know
you were doing that?

19:36.998 --> 19:38.800
Okay, snap up here.

19:38.824 --> 19:41.052
Most of these
are government buildings.

19:41.076 --> 19:43.185
That's the old
Allingham Street Orphanage.

19:43.209 --> 19:45.015
Except that one is run by the county.

19:45.039 --> 19:46.981
So is the one in Torrance.

19:47.005 --> 19:49.297
Let's just take a peek
at that list again.

19:52.471 --> 19:53.906
Four of the five addresses

19:53.930 --> 19:58.511
are either state, city
or county-run orphanages.

19:59.145 --> 20:02.015
And the last address
is a private residence.

20:02.773 --> 20:05.157
It's also the last entry.

20:05.181 --> 20:09.274
If I were looking for answers,
I'd start with the last address first.

20:16.162 --> 20:18.285
- Hi. Can I help you?
- Hi.

20:19.040 --> 20:20.130
I'm sorry to disturb you.

20:20.154 --> 20:22.301
I was just hoping you might help me
find someone

20:22.325 --> 20:25.953
who possibly stayed here
a long time ago.

20:31.052 --> 20:32.190
Her name is Amy.

20:32.214 --> 20:33.797
Oh, of course.

20:34.472 --> 20:36.678
I remember Amy.

20:36.974 --> 20:39.073
Such a beautiful woman now.

20:39.097 --> 20:41.569
And you are?

20:41.593 --> 20:43.562
I work for a law firm.

20:44.398 --> 20:48.562
She may have inherited some property
and I just need to confirm her identity.

20:51.489 --> 20:54.158
Well, then you'd better come in.

20:54.909 --> 20:56.367
Thanks.

20:58.746 --> 21:00.465
Such a long time ago.

21:00.489 --> 21:03.238
Twenty-five years at least.

21:04.251 --> 21:07.087
She's here somewhere.

21:11.175 --> 21:13.298
My children.

21:13.677 --> 21:16.690
Some of them not for long.
A few days.

21:16.714 --> 21:20.424
Others a few weeks, months.

21:20.768 --> 21:23.555
Amy was one
who stayed a long time.

21:29.026 --> 21:32.312
Hard to believe, huh? So many.

21:33.906 --> 21:37.714
Most of them from broken families.

21:37.738 --> 21:40.199
Some orphaned.

21:43.457 --> 21:45.117
Is, um?

21:45.709 --> 21:47.998
Is your photo up here?

21:55.136 --> 21:56.250
Not here.

21:57.638 --> 21:59.512
But someplace.

22:00.099 --> 22:02.388
Many places?

22:04.311 --> 22:05.343
Thirty-seven.

22:09.150 --> 22:10.620
Oh, here she is.

22:10.644 --> 22:12.775
This is Amy.

22:14.655 --> 22:17.383
She must have been
about 15 at the time.

22:17.407 --> 22:20.386
She stayed almost two years. She...

22:20.410 --> 22:22.985
She was a troubled girl.

22:23.956 --> 22:28.250
Something in her past, I think,
that she kept to herself.

22:29.336 --> 22:33.085
She still sends me a birthday card
every year.

22:33.382 --> 22:35.090
Not all of them do anymore.

22:35.718 --> 22:40.759
I used to worry when I would just
suddenly stop hearing from someone.

22:41.182 --> 22:46.971
And then one day I realised
they probably just found their way.

22:50.357 --> 22:51.733
At least that's what I hope.

22:53.194 --> 22:54.392
That's the latest one.

22:58.741 --> 23:00.698
Powerful emotion, hope.

23:03.454 --> 23:05.281
Yes, it is.

23:09.502 --> 23:11.044
Amy ever talk about her family?

23:13.506 --> 23:16.341
That's a long time ago
to remember something like that.

23:17.218 --> 23:18.926
That's okay.

23:20.805 --> 23:23.426
- Thanks for everything.
- Yeah.

23:26.268 --> 23:27.300
You know, Amy, uh...

23:28.395 --> 23:29.427
Amy was an orphan.

23:30.231 --> 23:32.080
But I do remember.

23:32.104 --> 23:33.769
She said she had a brother.

23:47.021 --> 23:48.824
Karim Akbari.

23:48.848 --> 23:51.572
Formerly a senior member
of SAVAK,

23:51.596 --> 23:55.560
the shah of Iran's secret police
back in the 1970s.

23:55.905 --> 23:57.981
Was the SAVAK trained by the CIA?

23:59.784 --> 24:01.326
In 1979,

24:01.827 --> 24:05.161
the shah was overthrown
and went into exile.

24:05.498 --> 24:07.431
There were rumours
that his supporters

24:07.455 --> 24:11.895
moved half a billion dollars out of Iran
into various bank accounts in Europe

24:11.919 --> 24:14.923
to be used
to restore the shah to power.

24:15.174 --> 24:17.250
But 18 months later,
the shah was dead.

24:17.927 --> 24:20.358
And the money
was never recovered.

24:20.382 --> 24:24.065
After the shah's death,
Akbari started looking for it.

24:24.089 --> 24:27.658
While he didn't find the money,
he did find this man.

24:27.682 --> 24:29.312
Michael Lawson,

24:29.563 --> 24:31.936
an American banker
who lived in Iran.

24:32.316 --> 24:36.788
Akbari believed it was Lawson who
transferred the money and had access

24:36.812 --> 24:38.980
to the account numbers
and passwords.

24:39.782 --> 24:43.032
Lawson was found murdered
six weeks after the shah's death.

24:43.327 --> 24:44.382
Let me guess.

24:44.406 --> 24:47.116
Strung up by his feet
to a light fitting and tortured?

24:48.124 --> 24:49.808
Keelson uncovered information

24:49.832 --> 24:52.100
that suggested
the money was still out there.

24:52.124 --> 24:55.474
Akbari found out,
came looking for Keelson

24:55.498 --> 24:59.587
and found his associate,
Mr. Browning, instead.

25:00.052 --> 25:03.444
And there endeth the briefing.

25:03.468 --> 25:05.655
So which one
does CIA want the most?

25:05.679 --> 25:08.388
Akbari or the money?

25:09.312 --> 25:11.529
Akbari is a zealot.

25:11.553 --> 25:14.577
If he gets his hands on that money,

25:14.601 --> 25:17.077
his plan is to try
and buy nuclear weapons

25:17.101 --> 25:18.737
and invade Iran.

25:19.363 --> 25:21.937
Not a good outcome for any of us.

25:22.283 --> 25:24.821
We're all on the same side here,
Agent Hanna.

25:25.119 --> 25:26.364
I'm glad to hear it.

25:26.954 --> 25:29.706
Then you won't have a problem
telling me how you got on to Browning.

25:30.958 --> 25:33.472
We intercepted a call
between he and Akbari.

25:33.496 --> 25:35.709
Used it to trace Browning's address.

25:36.547 --> 25:38.421
Got there too late.

25:40.051 --> 25:46.670
Akbari was demanding information
about someone named Amy Taylor.

25:47.058 --> 25:48.256
Happen to know who that is?

25:49.810 --> 25:51.637
Your guess is as good as mine.

25:53.105 --> 25:54.516
Yeah.

26:28.432 --> 26:30.472
Hey! What are you doing?

26:36.565 --> 26:37.976
Help me.

26:42.738 --> 26:43.818
Federal agent. No one move.

27:17.481 --> 27:22.368
Eric, south on Lincoln, blue van.
I'm in pursuit. Need L.A.P.D. Backup.

27:22.392 --> 27:24.028
I'm on it.

28:19.418 --> 28:21.078
Crap.

28:22.755 --> 28:25.791
Hetty,
you need to come up to Ops now.

29:14.765 --> 29:18.099
- Someone get an ambulance!
- Okay, I'll call.

29:24.316 --> 29:25.787
Steve, where are you?

29:25.811 --> 29:27.858
Is this Amy Taylor?

29:28.154 --> 29:29.328
Who is this?

29:29.352 --> 29:30.917
I'm a federal agent.

29:30.941 --> 29:35.089
Amy, you need to listen to me.
Your ex-husband has been injured.

29:35.113 --> 29:37.089
If he knows where you are,
he told someone

29:37.113 --> 29:38.367
and they are coming for you.

29:44.044 --> 29:45.680
- Is this your car?
- Whoa.

29:45.704 --> 29:47.564
I'm a federal agent.
Give me your keys.

29:47.588 --> 29:49.915
- Yeah, yeah.
- Give me your keys.

29:56.307 --> 29:58.156
Eric, check this number.

29:58.180 --> 30:00.723
I need the location
of the cell phone last dialled.

30:03.355 --> 30:07.898
The call was to a cell phone
in South Central near the river.

30:08.861 --> 30:11.043
Callen, I can only narrow it down
to a four-block radius

30:11.067 --> 30:13.361
bordering Allingham Street.

30:13.574 --> 30:14.605
Callen.

30:18.370 --> 30:20.884
- Line must've dropped out.
- Then get it back.

30:20.908 --> 30:22.362
Allingham Street.

30:22.708 --> 30:24.701
That's one of the addresses
in the notebook.

30:26.045 --> 30:27.918
Does Callen know that?

30:28.380 --> 30:29.661
Yes.

30:30.633 --> 30:35.627
Eric, the cell phone number
Callen had you trace, who owns it?

30:39.475 --> 30:40.803
He's found her.

31:21.892 --> 31:24.348
- Amy?
- Who are you?

31:24.895 --> 31:25.926
I called.

31:26.272 --> 31:28.181
I'm the federal agent.

31:28.983 --> 31:30.441
My name is Callen.

31:34.321 --> 31:35.353
Who are you?

31:37.575 --> 31:39.484
I'm your sister.

31:43.455 --> 31:45.199
I don't have a sister.

31:47.501 --> 31:48.782
Now, who the hell are you?

32:00.380 --> 32:03.547
Sam and Kensi are 15 minutes
from the orphanage.

32:04.676 --> 32:06.918
Try Callen again.

32:08.180 --> 32:11.845
My name is, uh, Hannah Lawson.

32:12.392 --> 32:15.120
And until the age of about 11, I...

32:15.144 --> 32:19.440
I lived in Iran with, uh, my father.

32:20.275 --> 32:22.482
His name was Michael Lawson.

32:23.195 --> 32:27.608
My mom, she died when I was 3,
so my father was...

32:28.283 --> 32:29.481
He was just everything to me.

32:32.162 --> 32:34.949
A while after we got back here, um,

32:35.165 --> 32:39.033
my father showed me
this hiding place

32:39.711 --> 32:41.431
in the house that we were staying in.

32:41.455 --> 32:44.179
Inside it was this leather satchel.

32:44.203 --> 32:50.801
I don't know why he showed it to me,
but he said it was our secret.

32:51.557 --> 32:52.943
And a couple of days later,

32:52.967 --> 32:55.027
some men,
they forced their way into the house.

32:55.051 --> 32:57.932
They were, uh, Iranian.

32:58.730 --> 33:01.707
And they turned the television on
really loudly

33:01.731 --> 33:06.194
and they tore the lighting fitting...

33:08.282 --> 33:10.570
Eventually, the, uh...

33:12.494 --> 33:17.785
All the lights blew out
and they couldn't see me in the dark.

33:18.750 --> 33:20.269
And I ran away.

33:20.293 --> 33:23.034
I just lived on the streets.

33:23.922 --> 33:30.186
Finally, welfare picked me up
and this is where they brought me.

33:30.210 --> 33:32.569
I barely spoke for months
because I was so terrified

33:32.593 --> 33:34.733
that those men would come
and get me.

33:34.757 --> 33:37.638
I just wanted a different name.

33:39.813 --> 33:40.892
Why my name?

33:42.316 --> 33:43.537
You...

33:43.561 --> 33:45.062
You had a sister.

33:46.361 --> 33:47.642
Her name was Amy.

33:48.238 --> 33:49.756
And she...

33:49.780 --> 33:51.229
She slept over there

33:51.950 --> 33:54.441
and she was my friend.

33:54.786 --> 33:56.162
I don't have a sister.

33:57.164 --> 33:58.717
- She told me about you.
- No.

33:58.741 --> 34:03.139
Yeah. She said she used to push you
in a little cart.

34:03.163 --> 34:04.937
Like a little red cart.

34:04.961 --> 34:10.101
And you used to scream
to go faster and faster.

34:10.125 --> 34:12.105
Faster!

34:12.129 --> 34:15.424
And one day it crashed
and you hurt your arm.

34:19.853 --> 34:21.016
I'm so sorry.

34:24.358 --> 34:26.350
And Amy cried and you didn't...

34:26.735 --> 34:29.248
And then she swore
that she would always...

34:29.273 --> 34:30.987
Always protect you.

34:43.793 --> 34:44.992
Come on.

35:05.482 --> 35:06.561
Federal agent!

35:09.528 --> 35:10.903
Come on.

36:14.176 --> 36:16.667
- G.
- I'm good.

36:29.691 --> 36:30.806
It's Kensi.

36:31.360 --> 36:33.245
Eric, we're secure.

36:33.269 --> 36:38.736
Callen and whoever she is,
are both fine.

36:45.624 --> 36:47.118
What happened to her?

36:48.919 --> 36:52.513
We used to sneak out at night.

36:52.537 --> 36:54.541
Just down to the river.

36:57.302 --> 36:59.295
This one time she slipped.

37:00.639 --> 37:03.308
I tried to save her and it just...

37:05.686 --> 37:06.717
Just swept her away.

37:07.312 --> 37:09.601
So I hid in her bed.

37:11.984 --> 37:15.353
And they thought Hannah Lawson
had gone missing.

37:17.656 --> 37:21.274
Both blonds, both the same age.

37:22.077 --> 37:24.864
They didn't really know us
and they didn't really care.

37:25.580 --> 37:27.869
It was easy to pretend.

37:29.167 --> 37:31.575
And about a month later
they found her body.

37:34.798 --> 37:37.087
And she was buried with my name,

37:37.718 --> 37:38.998
Hannah Lawson.

37:39.720 --> 37:41.926
And I lived with hers.

37:42.597 --> 37:44.424
Amy Callen.

38:01.366 --> 38:04.129
Done.
You sure you've got the authority

38:04.153 --> 38:06.711
to sign jurisdiction in this case
over to us, Kort?

38:06.735 --> 38:09.487
I wouldn't be here if I didn't.

38:09.750 --> 38:12.537
If she gives us the address,
we're done.

38:13.045 --> 38:16.330
We have no more interest
in Miss Lawson.

38:28.935 --> 38:31.782
2175 Ellison Way, Marina del Rey.

38:31.806 --> 38:34.743
It's in a wall cavity between the laundry
and the bathroom.

38:34.767 --> 38:37.230
It's in a leather satchel.

38:37.903 --> 38:39.942
Rather fond of Los Angeles.

38:42.074 --> 38:44.695
Maybe I'll put in for a transfer.

38:45.494 --> 38:46.525
I hope not.

38:52.918 --> 38:54.305
So, what's gonna happen

38:54.329 --> 38:58.335
when he finds out the place
was demolished 15 years ago?

38:59.007 --> 39:00.691
I'm not gonna hang around
and find out.

39:00.715 --> 39:02.627
Me neither.

39:20.946 --> 39:23.615
She loved you so much.

39:25.283 --> 39:27.501
You know,
she cried herself to sleep every night

39:27.525 --> 39:29.612
because she couldn't be with you.

39:49.933 --> 39:50.964
What did she call me?

39:56.940 --> 39:58.055
Baby brother.

40:00.318 --> 40:01.861
No, I...

40:02.237 --> 40:03.779
I mean...

40:07.159 --> 40:09.116
Just baby brother.

40:27.387 --> 40:30.400
You disobeyed my directive.
I can't let that stand.

40:30.424 --> 40:32.733
And you wouldn't have done
the same thing?

40:32.757 --> 40:36.326
Oh, I know my family, Mr. Callen.

40:36.350 --> 40:38.289
Believe me when I say

40:38.313 --> 40:41.020
sometimes I envy you
not knowing yours.

40:43.070 --> 40:44.480
I'm standing you down.

40:44.863 --> 40:45.954
Hetty, come on.

40:45.978 --> 40:48.171
For one day.

40:48.195 --> 40:50.406
Use it wisely.

41:29.407 --> 41:31.863
Something to share, Nate?

41:36.748 --> 41:39.120
This first address.

41:39.751 --> 41:42.218
That was the first orphanage
Callen was sent to.

41:42.242 --> 41:45.421
He was 5 years old.

41:46.591 --> 41:48.227
I really can't understand

41:48.251 --> 41:50.253
why they would separate him
from his sister.

41:58.019 --> 42:01.162
Each address was entered
chronologically

42:01.186 --> 42:03.016
all by the same person.

42:05.068 --> 42:08.271
And why is that surprising?

42:08.905 --> 42:12.025
It's in ageing hand, Hetty.

42:18.415 --> 42:20.882
Different pens, different pencils.

42:20.906 --> 42:23.100
These addresses weren't all added
at the same time,

42:23.124 --> 42:25.536
but as they happened.

42:26.131 --> 42:27.767
Every time Callen moved,

42:27.791 --> 42:31.549
the same person wrote down
his new address.

42:33.221 --> 42:35.712
You're saying someone...

42:36.308 --> 42:39.807
Someone was watching Callen
all those years?

42:41.980 --> 42:43.640
The same person.
