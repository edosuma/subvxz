02:15.720 --> 02:17.995
Well, we finished the errands, Mom.

02:18.240 --> 02:21.835
It's such a treat driving Dad's Dodge.
The noise, the rust...

02:22.080 --> 02:25.868
...the thrill of watching the open road
through the open floorboard.

02:26.120 --> 02:30.636
We got everything you wanted from
the store: bourbon-flavoured bonbons...

02:30.880 --> 02:32.677
...romance novels...

02:33.280 --> 02:35.669
...Kenny G CD.

02:36.520 --> 02:39.557
You and Dad are gonna have
quite a time tonight, huh?

02:39.760 --> 02:41.796
Batteries.

02:46.720 --> 02:49.598
You know, it seems like there's
something we forgot to do today.

03:01.160 --> 03:04.470
I guess my cries this morning
of " if you use the car...

03:04.720 --> 03:08.599
...please, I beg you, pick me up
from work" was a little vague.

03:09.520 --> 03:10.873
Al, would you shut up?

03:11.120 --> 03:14.032
We're trying to remember
what we forgot to do.

03:14.480 --> 03:16.914
How did I get home, you ask?

03:17.160 --> 03:20.470
Not having correct change
for public transportation...

03:20.720 --> 03:22.870
...nor the bills to get
correct change...

03:23.120 --> 03:26.237
...nor the job to get the bills
to get correct change...

03:26.480 --> 03:31.235
...I got a ride from two fine gentlemen
who drive the road-kill truck.

03:32.160 --> 03:33.832
How was your day, Peg?

03:34.080 --> 03:37.277
Anything interesting happen
on the couch?

03:37.520 --> 03:39.351
- Well, actually...
- I don't care.

03:42.880 --> 03:44.916
Give me my car key.

03:47.120 --> 03:50.078
Last time you get to use the Dodge!

03:53.320 --> 03:56.312
- How will I get to school?
- Yead, Dad. How will I get to work?

03:56.560 --> 04:01.998
How will I get to the store to buy the
double issue of the National Enquirer?

04:02.600 --> 04:05.512
And food and groceries.

04:05.800 --> 04:08.758
Dad, why don't you just get us a car?

04:09.000 --> 04:12.549
Jeez, Louise,
why didn't I think of that?

04:13.280 --> 04:15.748
New cars for everybody!

04:17.200 --> 04:19.952
Peg, would you like a BMW?

04:20.600 --> 04:22.795
I kind of see myself in a Jaguar.

04:23.440 --> 04:26.671
If only we could find one that hungry.

04:31.960 --> 04:35.669
Well, I have $400 saved from work.
I'll get a car myself.

04:35.920 --> 04:38.878
Hey, wait a second.
I have $400 saved too.

04:39.120 --> 04:42.351
We can pool our money
and share a car twice as nice.

04:42.600 --> 04:46.878
- Yeah. Not like Dad's piece of...
- Children!

04:47.200 --> 04:49.634
Oh, what the hell... Wolfen.

04:50.840 --> 04:55.152
Let me tell you something about
sharing. It can only come to trouble.

04:55.440 --> 04:59.319
Your mother and I shared a bed,
and nothing good came out of it.

05:00.600 --> 05:04.513
Well, maybe that's because
nothing good went into it.

05:08.200 --> 05:10.634
It doesn't matter. You've only got $800.

05:10.880 --> 05:12.950
And $800 can't buy you a car.

05:19.880 --> 05:23.031
- Jefferson, tell them what $800 can buy.
- Well...

05:23.280 --> 05:25.748
...it could buy you a nice car.

05:26.880 --> 05:29.394
You know where we can
get a car for $800?

05:29.640 --> 05:33.838
Car auctions. You know, where they
sell cars seized by federal agencies.

05:34.080 --> 05:36.799
True. They may not be
in the best of shape.

05:37.200 --> 05:39.794
Bullet holes, blood stains...

05:40.040 --> 05:42.759
...the smell of rotting bodies.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.470
But then you don't seem to mind
riding in the Dodge.

05:47.680 --> 05:50.399
There are no bullet holes in my Dodge.

05:51.080 --> 05:55.312
But that can be changed if
you're willing to crawl into the trunk.

05:56.000 --> 06:00.755
- Dad, take us to the auction. Please.
- We'll share.

06:05.920 --> 06:07.319
How'd the auction go?

06:07.680 --> 06:11.639
Do not touch the car. We don't know
where your hands have been.

06:11.880 --> 06:14.792
Then you better not sit in it!

06:20.600 --> 06:22.397
Fine.

06:22.680 --> 06:25.513
As you can tell, the kids purchased
a car. And as you can see...

06:25.760 --> 06:28.718
...all my fears about them sharing
were unfounded.

06:29.800 --> 06:31.836
I warned you!

06:36.240 --> 06:39.915
But on the good side, I got them
to knock off another $100 on the car.

06:40.160 --> 06:43.391
Why pay for seat belts
if you don't have brakes?

06:47.560 --> 06:50.711
- You know what I'm gonna do?
- Give the money to me?

06:50.960 --> 06:53.713
Yes. To buy groceries.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.991
Groceries?

06:57.480 --> 07:01.758
Yes, Peg. The stuff you have to
wade through to get to the TV Guide.

07:02.000 --> 07:06.232
And I better be able to eat everything
in that bag, Peg. Just food.

07:06.480 --> 07:08.152
Just beef.

07:08.400 --> 07:10.311
Just do it.

07:11.920 --> 07:15.515
That's right, Peg.
God, they look so firm.

07:16.600 --> 07:19.353
Hold them up for me, baby.

07:23.400 --> 07:26.233
Now let's see that pretty rump.

07:27.640 --> 07:28.868
Beautiful!

07:35.120 --> 07:37.873
Al, my blisters are hurting
from carrying that food...

07:38.080 --> 07:39.957
...to the checkout counter.

07:40.400 --> 07:41.719
If you'd been there before...

07:41.920 --> 07:45.276
...you'd know the carts
in front of the store are for that.

07:46.120 --> 07:49.317
I thought that was parking
for the homeless.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.036
You will never guess who I met.

07:54.280 --> 07:58.637
The guy who plays Neuter the Cat
on the Tender Innards commercials.

07:59.280 --> 08:00.952
You mean that one that says...

08:01.200 --> 08:06.149
..." If this meat were any fresher,
the jockey would still be riding it"?

08:06.760 --> 08:10.799
He's so hot. He's the 10th most
recognizable cat in media history...

08:11.040 --> 08:13.918
...behind Heathcliff
and the late Miles Davis.

08:14.400 --> 08:17.756
Look, sweetheart. Daddy's got meat!

08:19.480 --> 08:21.118
That's great, Daddy.

08:21.360 --> 08:23.715
This guy could do wonders
for my career...

08:23.960 --> 08:26.394
...so I asked him on a date
in my new car.

08:26.600 --> 08:28.158
Not so fast, Pumpkin.

08:28.400 --> 08:30.755
You're gonna need to be covered.

08:31.320 --> 08:33.788
Isn't that up to the guy, Dad?

08:36.360 --> 08:39.352
I'm talking about auto insurance,
you little...

08:42.360 --> 08:43.839
Oh, now, Pumpkin...

08:44.080 --> 08:47.550
...just so you didn't think
I didn't care, I got the best.

08:48.280 --> 08:51.272
South Forty Auto Insurance,
the farmer's friend.

08:51.520 --> 08:56.674
- But there are things you need to know.
- You registered it as a farm vehicle?

08:58.080 --> 09:02.756
Don't be surprised.
He registered the Dodge as a pull toy.

09:03.400 --> 09:06.392
The next thing I register's
gonna be a handgun.

09:08.080 --> 09:10.833
Sweetheart, now that you drive
a farm vehicle...

09:11.080 --> 09:14.197
...there are a few restrictions
you need to know about:

09:14.440 --> 09:18.274
One, you must not drive
on paved roads.

09:18.560 --> 09:22.951
Two, the Amish always have
the right of way.

09:23.160 --> 09:26.232
Three, since you always
must be on official business...

09:26.480 --> 09:29.040
...you must have this in your car
at all times.

09:35.560 --> 09:40.111
Hence the South Forty motto,
"No chicken, no check."

09:42.200 --> 09:44.589
Hey, Kel, great news. I got...

09:46.600 --> 09:49.160
South Forty Insurance, Dad?

09:50.120 --> 09:51.519
It's a damn fine company.

09:51.720 --> 09:56.157
Farmer's best friend,
next to a sheep and a tall wheat field.

09:59.280 --> 10:03.512
Anyhow, I got a date with a foreign
exchange student who's so easy...

10:03.720 --> 10:07.156
...she makes you look like
a calculus problem.

10:11.160 --> 10:15.870
Well, you can't have the car tonight
because I'm going out with Neuter.

10:17.200 --> 10:19.953
You can go out with Dad anytime.

10:23.800 --> 10:29.352
- I promised to take her to the drive-in.
- I'm taking my date there in my car.

10:29.600 --> 10:33.115
- I'm not giving up my date.
- I'm not giving up mine.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.958
American movies are so confusing.

10:52.200 --> 10:54.953
So much subtext. So much character.

10:56.440 --> 10:58.590
The important part to remember...

10:58.840 --> 11:01.912
...is that Elmer is mad at Bugs.

11:04.120 --> 11:08.352
You see, he tied his shotgun
into a bow earlier.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.718
Exchange student, huh?

11:13.200 --> 11:17.239
What did we send to her country,
a head of lettuce and some sand?

11:18.560 --> 11:20.710
What does she mean by that?

11:21.000 --> 11:23.036
Nothing.

11:23.400 --> 11:25.436
I'm just gonna get comfortable here.

11:28.400 --> 11:30.960
I'm sorry, Kel, if I hurt your legs...

11:31.160 --> 11:33.037
...or his hand.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.036
It's okay. Accidents happen.

11:40.280 --> 11:42.555
Which explains you.

11:44.800 --> 11:49.078
- Hey, shut up!
- We're trying to have sex over here!

11:49.320 --> 11:52.118
So are we!

11:53.320 --> 11:55.709
You know, I'm sure you
hear this all the time...

11:55.920 --> 11:58.832
...but your portrayal
of Neuter is staggering.

11:59.960 --> 12:01.234
Thanks.

12:01.480 --> 12:03.755
Have you seen my one where I say...

12:04.000 --> 12:07.629
..." My stomach hails
the taste of entrails"?

12:11.600 --> 12:13.716
Great date, Kel.

12:14.680 --> 12:17.797
What, was the 4000 Flushes guy busy?

12:21.080 --> 12:25.949
Well, I'm sorry if we were disturbing
you and Evita up here.

12:26.200 --> 12:31.718
It's just unusual for me to see you with
a date that doesn't require a patch kit.

12:35.120 --> 12:37.953
What does she mean by that?

12:38.760 --> 12:40.512
Nothing.

12:49.560 --> 12:50.788
Shut up!

12:51.320 --> 12:53.072
Come on. Come on.

12:53.320 --> 12:54.548
Let's go.

12:59.400 --> 13:02.915
All right, Kel, look.
We can't go on like this anymore.

13:03.160 --> 13:05.628
In order to make this
sharing thing work...

13:05.880 --> 13:08.952
...we have to coexist together
in the car, okay?

13:09.160 --> 13:11.276
Okay. Deal.

13:19.880 --> 13:21.108
Bud...

13:21.320 --> 13:25.029
...my loins are warm for you.

13:29.640 --> 13:31.551
Get out.

13:32.280 --> 13:33.759
No. I hate you.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.390
If you want the back seat,
get into someone else's car.

13:37.640 --> 13:39.278
That is really stupid.

13:40.880 --> 13:42.108
Hey...

13:42.360 --> 13:45.636
...wanna get into the back seat
of someone else's car?

13:46.680 --> 13:49.035
Or better yet, that pickup truck?

13:49.720 --> 13:51.438
Isn't that dangerous?

13:52.080 --> 13:55.436
Well, "Danger" is my middle name.

13:57.720 --> 14:00.439
Franklin's his middle name.

14:01.720 --> 14:04.473
Watch. I'll show you how easy it is.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.877
It's all clear.

14:20.120 --> 14:22.236
Come and get it.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.150
Hit the floor.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.230
Oh, look. He must really like you.

14:38.480 --> 14:41.278
He's wearing his underwear
with the hearts.

14:56.200 --> 14:59.351
Peg, what are you doing down there?

15:00.080 --> 15:01.877
I'm over here, Mongo.

15:02.240 --> 15:04.515
Well, Peg, where's my tri-tip?

15:04.840 --> 15:08.719
According to Jake, the refrigerator
couldn't handle that much food.

15:08.960 --> 15:11.190
So it just kind of OD'd.

15:11.800 --> 15:13.916
What are you saying?
That can't happen!

15:14.200 --> 15:16.350
Happened to Elvis.

15:17.520 --> 15:20.034
- Where's my food?
- I gave it to the poor.

15:20.280 --> 15:22.999
Well, then it's still around here.

15:23.760 --> 15:26.399
Get over it, Al. It's gone. And so am I.

15:26.640 --> 15:29.279
- I'm eating with the D'Arcys.
- What about me?

15:29.520 --> 15:32.034
- They don't like you.
- I don't like them.

15:32.240 --> 15:34.117
But I'm willing to go.

15:38.600 --> 15:40.556
Why do I come here?

15:41.640 --> 15:44.473
Why doesn't Willie Nelson
do a benefit for me?

15:44.720 --> 15:47.757
He could call it "Al Aid."

15:47.960 --> 15:50.758
I'm so hungry, I could eat a vegetable.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.956
Marcie?

16:06.080 --> 16:08.116
There's a note.

16:08.520 --> 16:12.877
Dear Daddy. Due to circus dances...

16:13.800 --> 16:17.554
- Due to circumst...
- What Kelly is trying to say is...

16:17.760 --> 16:19.716
...we had to dump the chick en.

16:19.960 --> 16:24.954
P.S. By the time you read this,
I'll be getting some.

16:27.120 --> 16:29.509
Love, Bud.

16:31.400 --> 16:34.153
What am I supposed to do
with a live chicken?

16:41.080 --> 16:44.675
Welcome to the terror dome.

16:57.080 --> 17:01.471
Well, I went
to the nurse-slash-hotdog lady.

17:03.080 --> 17:05.640
Did you know that
relish aids in clotting?

17:06.560 --> 17:08.868
Bud, you are so brave.

17:09.119 --> 17:11.998
You let the dog rip you to pieces
for me.

17:12.240 --> 17:16.074
I resonate in my seat for you.

17:20.920 --> 17:23.434
Get out!

17:25.680 --> 17:28.240
People with futures
are talking here.

17:28.920 --> 17:31.229
So you really brought your cat suit?

17:31.480 --> 17:35.393
Yeah. It helps me be myself.

17:36.440 --> 17:39.637
I know it's hard to believe,
but I'm a little shy.

17:39.880 --> 17:45.193
I had a tough childhood. People think
the rich have it easy. Well, we don't.

17:45.440 --> 17:47.237
Rich?

17:48.280 --> 17:50.350
I don't mean like trillionaires.

17:50.600 --> 17:52.955
Just a few billion.

17:56.960 --> 17:58.791
Anyway, I know it's strange...

17:59.040 --> 18:03.477
...but there are things I can say
in my costume that I can't say out of it.

18:03.720 --> 18:05.233
Like what?

18:05.720 --> 18:09.315
Like... inviting certain people I like...

18:09.560 --> 18:14.554
...to all-expense-paid trips
to certain island paradises that I own.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.355
Get out!

18:20.800 --> 18:23.758
Not this time, Fancy Feast.

18:28.720 --> 18:31.234
The worm has turned.

18:32.280 --> 18:34.840
You mean to tell me that a
couple seconds of cheap sex...

18:35.040 --> 18:37.235
...means more to you
than my happiness?

18:37.520 --> 18:40.637
A milk shake means more to me
than your happiness.

18:42.280 --> 18:44.748
Fine. Come on, Neuter.

18:46.280 --> 18:49.716
Let's walk amongst the pines
and empty tubes of ointment...

18:49.920 --> 18:52.957
...and talk of the things you own
and will give me.

18:54.960 --> 18:57.997
If you'll just help me out of these
bandages here...

18:58.240 --> 19:01.152
...we can test the shocks on this baby.

19:04.280 --> 19:06.794
So this island that you own...

19:07.040 --> 19:10.350
...is it near the beach?

19:16.040 --> 19:17.678
Yes.

19:18.120 --> 19:21.078
Well, then put your head on
and let's talk.

19:25.720 --> 19:27.472
Kelly...

19:27.720 --> 19:31.759
...l've been alone
for a long, long time.

20:03.200 --> 20:04.997
Just one more bandage.

20:05.880 --> 20:09.156
Then I can really hurt you.

20:11.840 --> 20:14.718
It's been so long.

20:16.720 --> 20:20.110
Well, it's gonna be even longer,
King Tut.

20:21.520 --> 20:25.229
- What are you doing here?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

20:25.480 --> 20:27.675
Sit down, Neuter.

20:31.800 --> 20:33.074
I'm hungry.

20:33.320 --> 20:36.835
Bud, why don't you go to the nurse
and get us a hot dog.

20:38.120 --> 20:41.874
- Why don't you go?
- No. You go.

20:43.880 --> 20:46.155
Look. Let's just both go, okay?

20:46.400 --> 20:48.197
All right.

20:53.880 --> 20:55.074
Look, Kel.

20:56.840 --> 21:00.515
- I'm sorry about your friend, okay?
- Yeah, well, it's okay.

21:00.760 --> 21:05.072
It's just my luck. All the other cats
are either married or gay.

21:05.320 --> 21:06.833
Listen. Let's not fight.

21:07.080 --> 21:08.911
You and Sonja take the car...

21:09.160 --> 21:13.472
...and Neuter and I will go hang out
in an alley. He's used to it.

21:13.720 --> 21:15.950
- Thanks, Kel.
- No problem.

21:16.280 --> 21:20.193
- Oh, Neuter!
- Oh, Sonja!

21:25.960 --> 21:28.554
You know what really hurts, Kel?

21:30.400 --> 21:34.393
Throwing meat in the car
and setting Cujo loose on them?

21:35.680 --> 21:37.910
You're way ahead of me.

21:38.160 --> 21:40.720
Then let's get it over with.

21:50.920 --> 21:52.990
Al, correct me if I'm wrong...

21:53.240 --> 21:56.949
...but didn't the insurance policy say
"no chicken, no check"?

21:58.680 --> 22:01.399
You hate to see me eat,
don't you, Peg?

22:01.640 --> 22:05.030
But it's too late.
It's in, and it's staying in.

22:05.520 --> 22:08.717
Yeah. I've heard that before.

22:13.600 --> 22:15.158
I'll get another chicken tomorrow.

22:15.360 --> 22:17.828
The chances of them
wrecking the car the one night...

22:18.080 --> 22:21.277
...the chicken isn't in it
is a billion-to-one.

22:21.800 --> 22:23.870
Daddy, we wrecked the car.

22:24.680 --> 22:25.908
On purpose.

22:26.160 --> 22:29.436
You were right.
Kelly and I aren't ready to share.

22:29.680 --> 22:32.240
So to get our money back,
we totalled it.

22:33.120 --> 22:35.714
All you have to do is toss
the chicken in the back seat...

22:35.920 --> 22:39.151
...before the insurance company
gets here and we're home free.

22:39.400 --> 22:41.356
You proud of us, big guy?

22:42.305 --> 22:48.838
