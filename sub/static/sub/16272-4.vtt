WEBVTT

00:00.470 --> 00:02.808
Hmm.
Huh.

00:02.843 --> 00:03.842
Hyah!

00:03.844 --> 00:05.343
Yes! Nothing but cart!

00:05.395 --> 00:07.596
Hey, Zorn, we got you
a new shower curtain.

00:07.648 --> 00:09.431
And a comforter for your guest bed.

00:09.483 --> 00:11.016
Aw, come on,
who needs a comforter?

00:11.068 --> 00:13.018
If we get cold,
we'll start an apartment fire.

00:13.020 --> 00:14.903
If we're gonna let Alan stay
with you for the whole weekend,

00:14.938 --> 00:17.022
you have to let us turn
your place into something

00:17.074 --> 00:18.673
- a little less...
- Horrible.

00:18.708 --> 00:19.357
Yeah, I think I know how

00:19.409 --> 00:20.992
to look out
for the welfare of my child.

00:21.028 --> 00:23.061
- Vodka and chainsaws?
- Yeah, that's right.

00:23.096 --> 00:25.330
Father and son
warrior weekend!

00:25.365 --> 00:27.616
<i>Weekend, weekend, weekend...</i>

00:27.668 --> 00:28.934
- What?
<i>- Hey, Mom.</i>

00:28.969 --> 00:30.786
- Can I get these?
<i>- Skateboarding?</i>

00:30.838 --> 00:32.587
Come on. You want to
do something extreme,

00:32.622 --> 00:35.040
I'll take you hiking.
I saw a snake once.

00:35.042 --> 00:36.708
- Come on.
- Okay.

00:36.743 --> 00:38.293
But you have to get
a helmet and pads.

00:38.328 --> 00:40.279
- What?
- A helmet, Edie? Come on.

00:40.314 --> 00:41.680
You might as well make
the kid skateboard in a diaper.

00:41.715 --> 00:45.383
Hey! No helmets at my place
this weekend, buddy.

00:45.419 --> 00:46.768
It's gonna be anarchy!

00:46.804 --> 00:48.820
We're gonna crack
all the skulls we want!

00:48.856 --> 00:50.222
- Zorn.
- What?

00:50.224 --> 00:51.873
I know you want Alan
to think you're cool

00:51.909 --> 00:54.810
and fun, but you can't be
his father and his friend.

00:54.862 --> 00:56.061
Yeah, you're right, you're right.

00:56.113 --> 00:58.730
- I should stop being his father.
- I'm saying,

00:58.732 --> 01:01.283
if Alan were to end up
hurt or arrested,

01:01.318 --> 01:03.735
he will never be allowed
at your house again,

01:03.737 --> 01:05.654
- ever.
- Okay, okay, fine, fine,

01:05.706 --> 01:07.405
fine, fine, I'll be
the king of safety.

01:07.407 --> 01:09.324
Now, if you'll excuse me.

01:10.711 --> 01:12.774
Whoo...

01:14.598 --> 01:19.000
Oh, my head.
So glad I didn't wear a helmet.

01:19.036 --> 01:21.286
<i><font color="cyan"> sync & correction by f1nc0

01:25.777 --> 01:29.227
Okay, Internet, just tell me how
to be safe with my teenage son.

01:29.263 --> 01:30.996
"Abstinence"?

01:31.031 --> 01:32.948
Well, I think Alangulon's got
that covered already.

01:32.983 --> 01:34.883
Got 'em.

01:34.918 --> 01:37.586
I do love him, though.

01:37.621 --> 01:39.104
Ah, now I feel bad.

01:39.156 --> 01:40.405
You know what?
I'm gonna tell him I said that.

01:40.440 --> 01:41.857
That'll make me feel better.

01:46.530 --> 01:48.246
<i>My dad is so lame.</i>

01:48.282 --> 01:51.583
No, dude, your dad's awesome.

01:51.618 --> 01:53.201
<i>So cool.</i>

01:53.237 --> 01:56.872
Looks like your new best friend
Jeff is back from suspension.

01:56.907 --> 01:58.256
He's not my best friend,
we just hang out in study hall.

01:58.292 --> 02:01.042
- I think he's bad news, man.
- No, he's cool.

02:01.094 --> 02:03.378
He's like... a walking
middle finger to adults.

02:03.430 --> 02:05.297
That's not cool. 
What?

02:05.299 --> 02:09.717
- Yo, son of Zorn, what up?
- Yo, what is up?

02:09.770 --> 02:11.469
What is up?
I don't care what's up.

02:11.471 --> 02:13.772
I'm down for whatevers.

02:13.807 --> 02:15.307
Uh, so what are you guys
doing this weekend, huh?

02:15.309 --> 02:17.542
You just gonna, like,
vape up ho-style?

02:17.578 --> 02:18.777
We were gonna drink
some brews at Nadia's,

02:18.812 --> 02:21.112
but her mom got out of the
hospital early, so that sucks.

02:21.148 --> 02:24.466
- Oh, lame mom.
- Totally, what are you doing?

02:24.501 --> 02:26.618
He's got a sleepover
at his dad's this weekend,

02:26.653 --> 02:28.136
- right, yeah?
- Oh, you know, it's like...

02:28.171 --> 02:30.322
gonna be like a crazy...
super party

02:30.324 --> 02:32.073
sleepover, not a sleepover,
more like...

02:32.109 --> 02:33.458
'cause we're not
gonna be sleeping!

02:33.493 --> 02:37.329
<i>We're gonna be
"Ah, party, party... party. Ah, rage on."</i>

02:37.381 --> 02:38.663
So you guys should
just roll on by,

02:38.665 --> 02:40.782
roll up in that... house party.

02:40.817 --> 02:42.367
It's an apartment,
but you should roll up in.

02:42.402 --> 02:44.469
Totally.
Shoot me the address.

02:44.504 --> 02:46.922
Yeah, I'm gonna text you
that address, with a text.

02:46.957 --> 02:49.057
- And it's gonna...
<i>- Mr. Holstein.</i>

02:49.092 --> 02:50.892
What did I tell you about
sitting on the lab tables?

02:50.928 --> 02:52.477
I don't know, what'd I tell
you about bumping into me

02:52.512 --> 02:54.312
at the mall with your weird kid?

02:54.348 --> 02:56.514
Principal's office.
Now.

02:56.550 --> 02:58.516
Why you got to ride my nuts?

03:01.455 --> 03:04.255
Yeah, let's see

03:04.291 --> 03:06.925
what Alangulon's hilarious
response to my invite is.

03:06.960 --> 03:09.210
<i>I hope he says no, but then,
in the comments writes</i>

03:09.246 --> 03:11.463
<i>"Psych, I love you so much, Dad."</i>

03:11.498 --> 03:15.684
Let's see, uh...
okay, he opened it, but no reply.

03:15.719 --> 03:17.285
Hmm.

03:17.321 --> 03:20.789
"For a good time, call Eric."

03:22.392 --> 03:25.093
<i>- Hello?
- Oh, hey, Eric? Hi, this is Zorn.</i>

03:25.128 --> 03:27.262
Uh, I got your number off
the bathroom wall here.

03:27.297 --> 03:29.798
Evidently, you seem to be a good
time expert, is that correct?

03:31.535 --> 03:32.968
Well, I'm just looking
for something to do

03:33.003 --> 03:34.202
with my 17-year-old.

03:34.237 --> 03:38.340
<i>Ew, no! No, I'm
not gonna do that with my son.</i>

03:38.375 --> 03:41.776
<i>- Why?
- Because laser tag is dumb.</i>

03:41.812 --> 03:44.696
I... it's just that my son and I
are still having trouble connecting.

03:44.731 --> 03:47.365
So I-I really need this
weekend to be kick-ass.

03:47.401 --> 03:48.500
Oh!

03:48.535 --> 03:49.985
Nothing but
the bottom of the can!

03:50.037 --> 03:51.353
I mean, you get it, yeah?

03:51.388 --> 03:53.455
You're the world's greatest
dad, you know what I'm saying.

03:53.490 --> 03:55.490
I just wish my ex
would get off my back

03:55.525 --> 03:56.758
with all her lame-ass rules.

03:56.793 --> 03:58.193
You know, she's got a curfew,

03:58.228 --> 04:00.929
there's no alcohol,
no instruments of chaos.

04:00.964 --> 04:03.548
Todd!
Help me out here.

04:04.801 --> 04:09.054
- I'm actually a divorced dad, too.
- Wow, they let you keep the mug.

04:09.089 --> 04:10.972
The first weekend
I watched my kid,

04:11.008 --> 04:14.642
uh, I let her ride her bike
without a-a helmet.

04:14.678 --> 04:16.861
- I had to take her to the ER.
- Hmm.

04:16.897 --> 04:21.332
<i>After that, my wife refused
to let me watch Amanda alone.</i>

04:21.368 --> 04:24.486
It's... it's been hard.

04:24.521 --> 04:28.957
- It's been really hard.
- Gonna be honest with you, Todd,

04:28.992 --> 04:30.675
you may be
the world's greatest dad,

04:30.711 --> 04:33.127
but you are not the world's
greatest storyteller.

04:33.797 --> 04:35.830
<i>Ooh!
Three meatballs on a spoon.</i>

04:35.866 --> 04:38.183
- Make a wish.
- I wish you'd stop eating soup.

04:38.218 --> 04:39.567
That's your third bowl.

04:39.603 --> 04:40.919
I'm making dinner.

04:40.954 --> 04:42.946
Edie, when I'm on my death bed,
do you think I'm gonna

04:42.947 --> 04:45.623
look back and go, "Oh, I
wish I'd have had less soup?"

04:45.625 --> 04:50.295
- I don't think so.
- Yo, ready to go to Dad's.

04:50.347 --> 04:52.297
- Wow, you seem excited.
- Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.

04:52.349 --> 04:53.515
Hanging out, Dad and I.

04:53.550 --> 04:55.016
Maybe get to know each other
kind of thing.

04:55.052 --> 04:57.886
So, don't forget you have that
planetary science paper due Monday.

04:57.938 --> 05:00.388
- I know.
- And just because you're staying at your dad's,

05:00.440 --> 05:01.439
it doesn't mean
the rules are different.

05:01.475 --> 05:03.174
I know, Mom, God.

05:03.210 --> 05:05.477
- Why you got to ride my nuts?
- What?!

05:05.529 --> 05:06.945
Oh, my.

05:06.980 --> 05:09.798
"Ride my nuts?"
Where did you hear that?

05:09.833 --> 05:12.517
- Ch... from a friend.
- That doesn't sound like Scott.

05:12.552 --> 05:15.120
- Well, I have other friends.
- Like who?

05:15.155 --> 05:18.973
- I don't know. Jeff.
- Jeff Holstein?

05:19.009 --> 05:20.842
The kid who pulled down
the grief counselor's pants?

05:20.877 --> 05:23.995
- That was hilarious.
- I've been pantsed.

05:24.030 --> 05:25.463
I've been pantsed many times.

05:25.499 --> 05:27.665
And it is not hilarious.

05:27.717 --> 05:29.717
<i>Well, I don't like you
hanging out with him.</i>

05:29.753 --> 05:34.005
Whatever, I guess
I'm just gonna wait in the car.

05:35.142 --> 05:37.008
See, this is what worries me.

05:37.060 --> 05:38.643
He doesn't realize he's still a kid.

05:38.678 --> 05:43.014
He needs rules.
I just hope Zorn gets that.

05:43.016 --> 05:46.851
Just relax, look, this is gonna
be a great weekend.

05:46.903 --> 05:48.186
Promise me you're
gonna have a good time

05:48.188 --> 05:51.106
with the Pattersons tonight.
Hmm?

05:51.158 --> 05:52.941
- Okay, I promise.
- Good.

05:52.993 --> 05:54.659
I just hope Bill doesn't tell
that boring story

05:54.694 --> 05:56.361
about Queen Latifah again.

05:56.413 --> 06:00.949
Hey, let's not ride
Bill Patterson's nuts too, okay?

06:00.984 --> 06:02.767
<i>You ready</i>

06:02.803 --> 06:04.636
for a kick-ass weekend?
Are you psyched?

06:04.671 --> 06:06.070
- Oh, I'm psyched.
- You're psyched, right?

06:06.106 --> 06:08.289
- I'm psyched.
- Oh, you're so psyched.

06:08.341 --> 06:09.991
It's gonna be total anarchy.

06:11.444 --> 06:13.278
- Uh... yeah, yeah, sure.
- Right?

06:13.313 --> 06:14.712
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

06:14.748 --> 06:16.181
"Anarchy."
Yeah, oh, yeah.

06:16.216 --> 06:17.632
Well, I know last
time it wasn't so great,

06:17.684 --> 06:20.385
but welcome to
Casa del Zorn 2.0.

06:20.437 --> 06:21.920
Hey, uh, you see
the swim flippers?

06:21.955 --> 06:23.288
And the, uh, couch there?
Those are new.

06:23.323 --> 06:25.757
And, uh...
Oh, best dad in the world.

06:25.792 --> 06:27.192
Also here. Part of the tour.

06:27.227 --> 06:29.744
And, uh, oh.
Refrigerator.

06:29.779 --> 06:31.479
Now, I know
what you're thinking,

06:31.515 --> 06:33.915
that's a butt-load of hummus,
but where's the pita?

06:33.950 --> 06:35.116
Well, I forgot to buy it.

06:35.152 --> 06:37.185
Hey, I'll take one of those
cold beer cans.

06:37.220 --> 06:39.871
<i>- Hmm.
- Uno cerveza, por favor?</i>

06:39.906 --> 06:41.472
"One beer for me" in Spanish.

06:41.508 --> 06:42.907
A beer? 
No, come on, no.

06:42.943 --> 06:44.309
Y-you don't want a beer.

06:44.344 --> 06:46.945
No, beer makes your...
your hands cold.

06:46.980 --> 06:50.415
Brr. Hey, but don't worry.
We've got...

06:50.467 --> 06:52.066
milk, milk, milk, milk...

06:52.102 --> 06:54.552
- Hey, what's that thing?
<i>- Oh, this baby?</i>

06:54.588 --> 06:56.671
Oh, this is a lava launcher.
Here, check it out.

06:56.706 --> 06:59.240
Oh, watch out.

06:59.276 --> 07:02.119
Yeah, I mean, lately I've just
been using it to defrost meat.

07:02.120 --> 07:04.896
Or fish sometimes, when I'm
thinking about the old cholesterol.

07:04.931 --> 07:06.681
So that thing could do some
pretty serious damage.

07:06.733 --> 07:08.666
Oh, hell yeah.
No, this thing

07:08.702 --> 07:10.568
will melt your face right off!

07:10.604 --> 07:13.705
Yeah!
So, I-I probably shouldn't

07:13.706 --> 07:16.007
leave it lying around like this.
Uh, so, uh...

07:16.042 --> 07:17.742
<i>well... put that there.</i>

07:17.777 --> 07:20.111
<i>And, um... and there.</i>

07:20.163 --> 07:21.763
<i>Over here.</i>

07:21.798 --> 07:23.715
<i>Here, smooth that out a little bit.</i>

07:23.750 --> 07:25.116
<i>And for good measure.
All right, there we go.</i>

07:25.151 --> 07:27.285
<i>- All gone.
- So that's the tour, huh?</i>

07:27.337 --> 07:28.620
Oh, not quite.

07:28.622 --> 07:32.290
Ta-da!
Check it out.

07:32.292 --> 07:35.093
Got you a sick place right here
to draw up battle plans,

07:35.128 --> 07:37.896
or, uh, compose
war ballads about me,

07:37.931 --> 07:39.514
or, or, maybe even
do your homework.

07:39.549 --> 07:42.717
- Oh, okay, these are Mom's rules.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

07:42.752 --> 07:44.819
no, these... yeah, these
are your mom's rules, yeah.

07:44.854 --> 07:46.120
But, but the most
important rule,

07:46.156 --> 07:50.608
and boy did she stress this,
is that we got to have fun.

07:50.644 --> 07:52.610
Hey, this almost feels
like a real room, right?

07:52.646 --> 07:54.012
It's crazy to think
that the previous tenant

07:54.047 --> 07:57.105
died under a mountain of
Lane Bryant catalogs in here.

07:57.582 --> 08:01.353
This is an absolute blow-out.
I don't even want to think

08:01.388 --> 08:04.472
what must be going through
his opponent's head right now.

08:04.524 --> 08:06.474
- Ow.
- Hit 'em with the Hein!

08:06.476 --> 08:07.776
Double touchdown.

08:07.811 --> 08:10.645
That's what I'm talking about.
And that's cool with me

08:10.697 --> 08:12.314
<i>'cause that lamp sucked.
Your mom made me get that lamp.</i>

08:12.316 --> 08:14.783
Not really my style,
I'm more of a torch guy.

08:14.818 --> 08:17.819
Oh, what's up, you getting ready
to do a halftime show for me?

08:17.871 --> 08:20.038
No, I'm just really beat.
I'm gonna go to the room.

08:20.073 --> 08:21.907
Hey, hey, I, you know,
I-I just hope all these rules

08:21.942 --> 08:24.993
- aren't harshin' your mellow.
- They're just mellowing my mellow.

08:25.028 --> 08:26.861
You know you said this weekend
was gonna be total anarchy.

08:26.897 --> 08:29.798
I thought we'd be like raging,
and chugging, and blasting.

08:29.833 --> 08:32.082
But instead it's just
been, like, sitting.

08:32.135 --> 08:35.020
I'm just gonna go
watch some Ferrari poster.

08:39.009 --> 08:41.359
Oh, man.

08:41.395 --> 08:48.683
"Sorry, Jeff.
Can't hang, feeling sick.

08:48.685 --> 08:52.487
Think I over-vaped."

08:52.522 --> 08:55.624
- That's stupid.
- Hey, buddy, listen, I, you know,

08:55.625 --> 08:58.610
I was just thinking out here,
maybe, uh, maybe we could

08:58.662 --> 09:02.047
- ease up a little bit on your mom's rules.
- Really?

09:02.082 --> 09:04.816
<i>Want to just toss me one of those, 
uh, beer can guys?</i>

09:04.851 --> 09:08.303
Oh, no, no, no!
Sorry, I'm, I'm drinking both of these.

09:14.928 --> 09:17.178
<i>Nice.</i>

09:17.214 --> 09:18.880
Did I ever tell you
about the time when,

09:18.932 --> 09:21.766
uh, Queen Latifah
gave me a high-five?

09:21.802 --> 09:23.051
<i>- Oh...
- This is good.</i>

09:23.103 --> 09:25.804
- Yes.
- Well, as you know, before I was a doctor,

09:25.856 --> 09:27.722
<i>- Hmm.
- I was a production assistant</i>

09:27.724 --> 09:29.524
<i>on Living Single.</i>

09:29.559 --> 09:30.642
Oh.

09:30.694 --> 09:32.143
<i>- Edie?
- Hey.</i>

09:32.195 --> 09:34.145
<i>- Oh, oh!
- Edie!</i>

09:34.197 --> 09:35.814
- Oh, my God.
- Oh my... Bill.

09:35.866 --> 09:37.782
Calm down, everyone.

09:37.818 --> 09:39.284
Edie?
Are you okay?

09:39.319 --> 09:41.619
- Edie.
- She doesn't have a pulse.

09:41.655 --> 09:43.071
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God!

09:43.073 --> 09:44.789
- God, okay.
- I'm gonna get someone here.

09:44.825 --> 09:46.124
- I'm gonna start CPR.
- Okay.

09:46.159 --> 09:48.877
- Oh.
- Billy Patterson?

09:48.912 --> 09:51.413
- I do declare.
- What the hell?

09:51.415 --> 09:53.081
Hey, Bill, look.

09:53.133 --> 09:55.050
The look on your face, Bill!

09:55.085 --> 09:56.134
- What just happened?
- Oh.

09:56.169 --> 09:57.385
Oh, you were just like,

09:57.421 --> 10:00.171
"Oh, my Lord, my dear friend
is no longer living."

10:00.223 --> 10:03.341
Wait, w-what just happened?
She was clinically dead.

10:03.393 --> 10:05.844
Well, I can kind of stop my
heart for a couple minutes.

10:05.896 --> 10:08.430
It's just a fun little
trick I learned at Zephyria.

10:08.482 --> 10:10.982
<i>Why would anyone
ever need to learn that?</i>

10:11.018 --> 10:12.267
My ex-husband
taught me how to do it

10:12.319 --> 10:13.601
in case our fortress was sacked.

10:13.603 --> 10:16.855
- Oh.
- So they'd leave you for dead?

10:16.907 --> 10:19.157
Oh, there was this one time
when Zorn needed a power crystal

10:19.192 --> 10:21.993
that these corpse-eating
beetles were guarding.

10:22.029 --> 10:24.195
And of course I didn't
want to be the bait,

10:24.247 --> 10:26.448
but he kept pressuring
me and pressuring me...

10:26.500 --> 10:29.250
and pressuring me and...

10:29.286 --> 10:32.037
Hey, Zorn, it's me.
I know I didn't mention it before,

10:32.089 --> 10:35.540
but do not teach
Alan how to stop his heart.

10:35.592 --> 10:39.010
I was obviously able to pick it up,
but remember, Colleen died.

10:39.046 --> 10:40.762
<i>Edie?</i>

10:40.797 --> 10:43.298
- Uh, I've got to go, that's it. Bye.
- Hey.

10:43.350 --> 10:46.184
What are you doing in here?
Shirley is pounding the good wine.

10:46.219 --> 10:48.520
Oh. I just came in
to get some lip balm.

10:48.555 --> 10:52.474
Lip balm? Sweetie, you know
how addictive lip balm is.

10:52.476 --> 10:54.809
What the hell, let me have some.

10:54.861 --> 10:57.062
Mm. Yeah,
that's good balm.

10:58.148 --> 11:00.148
Mm, yeah, I like that.

11:00.200 --> 11:01.399
Okay, that's...
that's good.

11:01.451 --> 11:02.650
- Honey, honey, honey...
- What?

11:02.702 --> 11:05.703
Hey, so it's cool
if I have friends over still, right?

11:05.739 --> 11:07.655
<i>Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
No problem.</i>

11:07.707 --> 11:09.941
<i>I mean, as long as
they're not total wads.</i>

11:09.976 --> 11:12.444
Hey, sorry, Eric. Yeah, my
kid's having friends over.

11:12.479 --> 11:14.262
I'm in a little bit
of a pickle, though.

11:14.297 --> 11:15.964
I mean, I want
to impress these teens,

11:15.999 --> 11:17.632
but I also need to obey
Edie's rules, you know?

11:17.667 --> 11:19.300
<i>I don't know
if you're trying to be funny</i>

11:19.336 --> 11:20.869
<i>by calling me again,
I just don't appreciate...</i>

11:20.904 --> 11:22.604
Hey, that's a good idea.

11:22.639 --> 11:25.340
Comedy is a universal
language, yeah.

11:25.375 --> 11:28.343
You know what? You're the best
bathroom guy I've ever called.

11:34.935 --> 11:37.685
P-chaw!

11:40.273 --> 11:43.191
- Oh, Jeff, yo, what's up?
- What's up, Guns?

11:43.243 --> 11:45.360
Nice shirt, yeah.
I'm just... different way.

11:45.412 --> 11:46.444
You guys know Son of Zorn?

11:46.496 --> 11:47.662
- Yeah.
<i>- No.</i>

11:47.697 --> 11:49.364
No. Yeah, no...

11:49.399 --> 11:53.251
- Ya know... uh...
- Whoa, that's a lot of hummus.

11:53.286 --> 11:55.703
- Hummus sucks!
- Yeah, hummus sucks!

11:55.755 --> 11:57.789
Probably some dumb chick
left it over here.

11:57.841 --> 12:01.176
If you want to get up on some
beer and get it in your mouths?

12:01.211 --> 12:02.627
<i>Hey, did someone order
a party elf?</i>

12:02.662 --> 12:06.731
Hi, I am Dingle,
from the Elvin land of Huff.

12:06.766 --> 12:10.418
I have traveled from afar to
fulfill all your sexual desires.

12:11.721 --> 12:13.138
That's just what
party elves say.

12:13.173 --> 12:14.556
I'm not actually
gonna do that last thing.

12:14.608 --> 12:15.540
Hey, what's up, dudes?

12:15.575 --> 12:17.325
I'm Zorn, Alangulon's dad.

12:17.360 --> 12:20.395
I'm sure he's already told you
how bonkers I am.

12:21.898 --> 12:23.448
Hyah!

12:23.483 --> 12:24.732
- What the hell?!
- What?

12:24.768 --> 12:26.234
He looked!
You looked, right?

12:26.236 --> 12:28.203
Come on, don't you guys
have that game here?

12:28.238 --> 12:30.121
- It's huge in Zephyria.
- Okay, you just assaulted a teenager.

12:30.157 --> 12:31.906
- It's not cool!
- You know what?

12:31.958 --> 12:33.541
You're right, Alangulon.

12:33.577 --> 12:35.660
Not cool for an adult
to do that to a kid, no.

12:35.712 --> 12:37.212
<i>Hey, but you know what is cool?</i>

12:37.247 --> 12:39.764
A little Blues Traveler,
Live at Red Rocks, ha ha.

12:39.799 --> 12:42.400
- Your dad's super weird.
- Yeah, super weird.

12:42.435 --> 12:43.768
Oh, oh!
Found it, found it.

12:43.803 --> 12:45.703
Oh, yeah!

12:45.739 --> 12:47.889
You know, Alangulon, you were
actually conceived to this song.

12:47.924 --> 12:49.557
Yeah, we're just gonna go.

12:49.593 --> 12:52.093
We're just gonna hit this skate
spot and throw bricks at stuff.

12:52.095 --> 12:54.095
Oh, you know what?
Uh, if you're gonna...

12:54.097 --> 12:55.580
gonna do some destruction,

12:55.615 --> 12:57.882
I probably have a thing
that you might be into.

13:02.022 --> 13:05.623
<i>♪ Oh, once upon
a midnight dreary ♪</i>

13:05.659 --> 13:07.275
<i>♪ I wo... I wo... I wo... ♪</i>

13:07.327 --> 13:09.110
Aw, damn it, come on!

13:09.162 --> 13:11.029
<i>I...</i>

13:11.064 --> 13:13.281
shouldn't have taken these
CDs to the beach, I guess,

13:13.283 --> 13:16.451
is the lesson there, but then,
what's the point of having 'em, right?

13:16.453 --> 13:18.019
Oh, oh, are we leaving?
Okay.

13:18.054 --> 13:20.705
It's a little short notice, but I
can be ready in five mementos, okay?

13:20.757 --> 13:22.373
I just got to rub some lotion
on my strap rash.

13:22.425 --> 13:23.625
You know what?
No, it's cool.

13:23.677 --> 13:26.127
We're just gonna go meet some
friends at the hockey rink,

13:26.179 --> 13:27.462
and no one's bringing their dads.

13:27.464 --> 13:28.913
So you wouldn't have
anyone to talk to

13:28.949 --> 13:30.882
about dad stuff or anything.

13:30.934 --> 13:33.968
Uh, yeah, but I mean, your
curfew is in 20 minutes, so...

13:33.970 --> 13:37.272
What?
Oh, "curfew." What?

13:37.307 --> 13:39.807
Remember how we said
we're not gonna follow

13:39.809 --> 13:41.142
- all of Mom's rules, right?
- Y-Yeah.

13:41.144 --> 13:42.894
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know, okay.

13:42.929 --> 13:44.457
You get out of here, okay,
and go have fun.

13:44.492 --> 13:47.765
Be safe, or not. Whatever. 
Who cares?

13:47.801 --> 13:49.693
Hey, if you die or get
maimed, we'll just tell your

13:49.694 --> 13:52.224
mom you were already like
that when you got here, right?

13:53.242 --> 13:55.663
Thanks for coming.
You guys drive safe.

13:55.712 --> 13:56.887
<i>Thanks for having us!</i>

13:58.420 --> 14:01.873
Now tell me, haven't those two
over didn't help take your

14:01.908 --> 14:04.242
- mind off of Alan and Zorn.
- No, it did. Thanks, sweetie.

14:04.294 --> 14:07.087
- It was fun.
- Yeah, good.

14:07.379 --> 14:10.748
<i>Hey, you know
what else would be fun?</i>

14:10.800 --> 14:13.551
- What's that?
- Having sex on this couch.

14:13.586 --> 14:17.388
We have the whole place to ourselves.

14:17.424 --> 14:20.174
Oh, I like
"Three Chardonnays Craig."

14:20.226 --> 14:23.344
Well, I love "Three Servings
of Mashed Potatoes Edie."

14:28.067 --> 14:29.650
- Edie.
- Mm-hmm?

14:29.686 --> 14:31.119
You're texting Alan
right now, aren't you?

14:31.154 --> 14:35.857
No, I'm, um... I'm looking
for a good couch sex song.

14:35.859 --> 14:38.526
Alan is almost an adult.
You can trust him.

14:38.528 --> 14:40.945
I know, I just can't stop
thinking about Zorn.

14:40.997 --> 14:42.897
Okay, well, whatever
gets you there, baby.

14:42.932 --> 14:45.416
- Craig!
- I'm sorry. Okay, look...

14:45.452 --> 14:47.168
It's obvious you're not
gonna be able to relax

14:47.203 --> 14:49.287
and have sex with me on this couch until

14:49.288 --> 14:51.372
we go and see for
ourselves that he's okay.

14:51.374 --> 14:53.424
Thank you.
I'll get the keys.

14:53.460 --> 14:56.878
All right, but...
couch check on the rain sex.

14:56.930 --> 15:01.015
"Couch sex on the rain..."
I'm wasted!

15:01.050 --> 15:03.534
<i>Let there be light!</i>

15:03.570 --> 15:05.102
Good as new.

15:05.138 --> 15:07.371
And for that,
you deserve a treat.

15:07.407 --> 15:10.057
♪ Meat, meat,
beautiful treat ♪

15:10.093 --> 15:13.377

15:22.238 --> 15:24.822
Now, just gotta get the
lava launcher here. Um...

15:24.858 --> 15:27.291
<i>What the hell?</i>

15:27.327 --> 15:28.783
Pick up, pick up,
pick up, come on.

15:28.818 --> 15:31.579
Ugh!
Hey, uh, son, it's Dad again.

15:31.581 --> 15:33.581
It's just, um...
I-I'm missing something.

15:33.633 --> 15:36.300
You know, no big deal,
but starting to get nervous

15:36.336 --> 15:38.169
but, like, in a...
in a very cool way.

15:38.221 --> 15:41.372
So if you get this, just, uh,
holla back, girl!

15:41.407 --> 15:45.293
Lava... launcher... accidents.

15:45.328 --> 15:47.228
<i>What's up, Larry Nation?
This is Larry.</i>

15:47.263 --> 15:49.597
<i>I just got back
from a trip to Zephyria...</i>

15:49.649 --> 15:53.167
<i>and I smuggled this bad boy
through customs.</i>

15:53.203 --> 15:54.936
<i>Now, I'm gonna press
this button right here,</i>

15:54.988 --> 15:57.605
<i>which looks like the "safety" button...</i>

15:59.292 --> 16:02.226
Oh, you dumbass!

16:02.262 --> 16:03.895
You... Oh, wait.

16:03.930 --> 16:05.696
Eric, I'm freaking out over here.

16:05.732 --> 16:08.799
I tried being more permissive
to make Alangulon happy,

16:08.835 --> 16:10.535
but now I'm worried he's gonna
get killed by lava.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.904
I mean, why is it do hard
to be a father and a friend?

16:12.939 --> 16:14.505
- I just don...
<i>- I don't know you.</i>

16:14.541 --> 16:15.973
You're right, you're right.
I'm sorry.

16:16.009 --> 16:17.475
I'm making this all about me again.

16:17.510 --> 16:19.277
No, go ahead, please.
Tell me more about you.

16:19.312 --> 16:20.511
<i>I'm an accountant.</i>

16:20.547 --> 16:22.213
Wow, so you work
in accounting. Where?

16:22.248 --> 16:23.447
<i>At Sanitation Solutions.</i>

16:23.483 --> 16:27.151
Oh, no way! I work at
Sanitation Solutions, too.

16:27.186 --> 16:28.019
I mean, what are the odds
that you would have

16:28.054 --> 16:29.387
your number
on a bathroom wall,

16:29.422 --> 16:31.322
and I'm the guy calling it?

16:31.357 --> 16:34.058
Well, I should probably
go find my kid.

16:34.093 --> 16:35.576
Oh, what's up?

16:37.130 --> 16:39.931
- How you doing?
- Yeah.

16:39.966 --> 16:42.833
- What up?
- Nighttime, yeah.

16:42.885 --> 16:44.869
All right, Son of Zorn...
show 'em.

16:44.904 --> 16:46.203
Check this out.
Check it out.

16:46.239 --> 16:47.872
All right.

16:49.409 --> 16:52.159
All right, there she blows.

16:53.580 --> 16:55.129
So what do you say
we line up some cans

16:55.164 --> 16:57.582
and just let...
show 'em who-who's boss.

17:03.306 --> 17:05.957
- Let's melt some cars.
- W-What?

17:07.676 --> 17:09.426
Cars? Those have...

17:09.479 --> 17:11.262
Those are, like, sup...
Those are people's cars.

17:11.314 --> 17:13.798
- Yeah.
- Yeah, but if you do that, then, like,

17:13.833 --> 17:15.316
- they won't be able to drive...
- Who cares?

17:15.351 --> 17:17.167
I don't care. Yeah.

17:17.203 --> 17:19.436
That's a dumb one right there.
I'm gonna...

17:19.489 --> 17:20.838
blast it a new one.

I'm not gonna do it. I'm not
gonna shoot a car, all right?

17:31.784 --> 17:33.534
- Weak.
- Why?

17:33.536 --> 17:34.952
I mean, what if one
of those cars belonged

17:35.004 --> 17:36.370
to some other cool kids
who don't care about anything?

17:36.372 --> 17:37.205
And then... we'd be

17:37.206 --> 17:38.926
- hurting our own, then.
- Weak, man.

17:38.961 --> 17:39.707
- Come on, just give it.
- No, come on, seriously.

17:39.709 --> 17:42.005
If we don't melt the cars,
then they go unmelted.

17:42.040 --> 17:43.928
- Yeah, exactly. Ah, ah, ah...
- You want that?

17:43.963 --> 17:46.464
<i>Oh...</i>

17:51.604 --> 17:55.409
<i>Lava launchers suck!</i>

17:56.866 --> 17:59.293
<i>What's going on back here? </i>

17:59.328 --> 18:01.995
- Uh, don't shoot!
- With what, my flashlight?

18:01.997 --> 18:05.466
My Velcro wallet?
I'm a security guard.

18:05.501 --> 18:08.335
- But I am gonna call the police.
- Excuse me, sorry.

18:08.387 --> 18:10.637
Hi. No need for that, sir,
I'm his father.

18:10.673 --> 18:14.491
Oh, well, this pool of lava in
my parking lot is all right, then.

18:14.527 --> 18:16.810
You are in a lot
of trouble, young man.

18:16.846 --> 18:18.178
Now, go wait over there
while I clear things up

18:18.230 --> 18:20.524
- with this gentleman... Now!
- Yeah.

18:20.559 --> 18:23.183
Don't make me take my
battle strap off, son.

18:24.253 --> 18:25.619
All right, buddy,
how much is it gonna take

18:25.654 --> 18:27.905
- for you to blame this on a meteor?
- 500.

18:27.940 --> 18:30.707
- How 'bout I give you $338?
- 400, then.

18:30.743 --> 18:32.393
Oh, no, we're not
bargaining. You think I

18:32.394 --> 18:33.719
would have offered you such a specific

18:33.720 --> 18:35.045
amount if it wasn't all the money I had

18:35.081 --> 18:37.698
- on me right now? Come on.
- All right, then,

18:37.700 --> 18:40.284
throw in that
and we'll call it even.

18:40.319 --> 18:43.253
Well, since you wear a uniform,
I guess I can trust you.

18:43.289 --> 18:44.288
Take a picture.

18:44.340 --> 18:48.509
For my OkCupid account.
Come and gat it, ladies.

18:48.544 --> 18:50.444
There you go, that's good.

18:50.479 --> 18:52.679
Okay, lift the gun a little bit higher.
Now look a little sexier.

18:52.715 --> 18:54.815
- Yeah.
- Oh, that's good!

18:58.938 --> 19:00.187
- Dad, I...
- Shut up!

19:00.222 --> 19:02.189
Thank God you're safe!

19:02.224 --> 19:03.223
I didn't know where you were.

19:03.259 --> 19:06.193
And I had this feeling I've
never experienced before,

19:06.228 --> 19:08.312
where my heart was racing
and my palms were sweating.

19:08.347 --> 19:11.615
I looked it up online and it said
it was either fear or ovarian cysts.

19:11.650 --> 19:13.400
I just love you so much.

19:13.402 --> 19:15.235
You know, you're my
little Alangatang.

19:15.237 --> 19:17.020
Yeah, uh, I'm sorry, Dad.

19:17.056 --> 19:19.306
You know, I just wanted those
people to like me more, so...

19:20.476 --> 19:22.209
That goes away when
you get older, right?

19:22.244 --> 19:25.412
Yeah, yeah, like
ovarian cysts, I hope.

19:25.447 --> 19:28.849
- I guess now I have to punish you, huh?
- Yeah, probably.

19:28.884 --> 19:31.268
Well, in Zephyria,
we'd murder your whole family,

19:31.303 --> 19:33.704
but, obviously, that wouldn't
work out for your old man here.

19:33.739 --> 19:35.706
- Um...
- You could send me to my room.

19:35.741 --> 19:38.342
Yeah, yeah. No, that seems
more appropriate, doesn't it?

19:38.377 --> 19:39.743
You know, without the Ferrari poster

19:39.778 --> 19:41.345
it's basically just a prison cell.

19:42.431 --> 19:43.614
Oh, no.

19:43.649 --> 19:45.532
- Really, Zorn?
- What?

19:45.568 --> 19:46.934
I don't know
what I'm angrier about,

19:46.986 --> 19:49.687
the fact that you're
out past curfew,

19:49.689 --> 19:51.188
or that Alan isn't
wearing a jacket.

19:51.190 --> 19:55.025
- It is kinda chilly, Zorn.
- What do you have to say for yourself?

19:55.077 --> 19:57.344
- You want the truth, huh?
- Uh-huh.

19:57.380 --> 19:59.647
Okay, well, the truth is, I just...

19:59.682 --> 20:01.849
I-I had to do my
planetary sciences paper,

20:01.884 --> 20:05.319
and Dad said it was
a good night to see the sky,

20:05.354 --> 20:06.787
'cause Jupiter and Venus and...

20:06.822 --> 20:09.123
Mr. Egert, he said
we'd get extra credit

20:09.158 --> 20:11.125
- if we chart those, so...
- Yep, yep, yep.

20:11.177 --> 20:12.710
No, I told him about
the, uh, the planets.

20:12.762 --> 20:14.211
They were going nuts tonight, yeah.

20:14.263 --> 20:17.214
Well, I guess that
sort of makes sense.

20:17.216 --> 20:20.100
- So how'd you find us?
- She used "Find My Phone."

20:20.136 --> 20:22.319
You hacked my account?

20:22.355 --> 20:24.204
Family, please, regardless
of whether or not

20:24.240 --> 20:26.690
someone completely betrayed
their son's trust tonight,

20:26.726 --> 20:30.077
the important thing is I'm a
better parent than you, Edie.

20:30.112 --> 20:32.913
Well, I guess
I overreacted tonight.

20:32.949 --> 20:38.786
Alan, you are responsible.
And, Zorn, you...

20:38.821 --> 20:41.455
are... I guess what
I'm trying to say is...

20:43.426 --> 20:45.993
Ahem! My throat!

20:48.064 --> 20:50.347
Something's in my...
is in my throat.

20:51.500 --> 20:54.158
- I'm sorry.
- Apology accepted.
