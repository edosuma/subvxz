01:01.785 --> 01:03.999
The insurgents
have step up their attack, sir.

01:04.342 --> 01:05.822
They want their base back.

01:06.154 --> 01:08.243
We cannot let our guard down
for a moment.

01:08.701 --> 01:11.630
Have all umbaran security
reconfigured and locked down.

01:11.969 --> 01:14.212
Interrogate the prisoners
if you have to.

01:14.337 --> 01:17.090
But I want this base
under our complete control,

01:17.333 --> 01:19.046
and I don't want excuses.

01:19.401 --> 01:21.857
Sir, there's a transmission
from general Kenobi.

01:22.249 --> 01:24.070
I'll take it in the tower.

01:31.542 --> 01:33.009
How's it coming?

01:33.514 --> 01:35.136
Tricky piece of hardware.

01:35.426 --> 01:37.763
Krell's got Jesse stacking ordnance.

01:39.967 --> 01:43.769
I'm still waiting for krell to thank us
for handing this base over to him.

01:49.455 --> 01:50.401
Where is he?

01:52.100 --> 01:54.056
General Kenobi, do you read me?

01:54.551 --> 01:57.950
<i>Congratulations on your capture
of the umbaran airbase, general.</i>

01:58.249 --> 02:00.020
<i>It's refreshing to have good news.</i>

02:00.145 --> 02:03.323
There will be time for celebration
when we've taken that capital.

02:03.707 --> 02:07.213
<i>Yes, I'm afraid that's going to be
more difficult than anticipated.</i>

02:07.517 --> 02:10.128
<i>Their attacks have increased,
and their long-range missiles</i>

02:10.253 --> 02:12.657
<i>are forcing us to retreat
from our positions.</i>

02:12.921 --> 02:15.034
I was hoping we'd cut off
their arm shipment

02:15.159 --> 02:17.261
and supplies
when we took this airbase.

02:17.429 --> 02:19.659
<i>It seems they're receiving
new arm shipment</i>

02:19.784 --> 02:21.883
<i>directly from
a supply ship orbiting...</i>

02:22.059 --> 02:23.322
General Kenobi?

02:23.800 --> 02:25.436
<i>Having difficulty transmit...</i>

02:25.896 --> 02:27.688
<i>They must be jamming our signals.</i>

02:27.856 --> 02:29.523
Can't we destroy the supply ship?

02:29.691 --> 02:32.188
<i>We're trying,
but with little success.</i>

02:32.313 --> 02:34.547
<i>Their fleet outnumbers ours,
and the extra ships,</i>

02:34.672 --> 02:36.822
<i>we were promised
have not yet arrived.</i>

02:37.081 --> 02:39.784
We'll just have to take
that capital regardless of the missiles.

02:40.481 --> 02:43.078
My battalion will meet you at
the rendezvous coordinates.

02:43.246 --> 02:44.940
<i>We cannot expect...</i>

02:46.250 --> 02:47.792
I'm trying to get him back, sir.

02:47.960 --> 02:48.983
Don't bother.

02:49.108 --> 02:51.352
The enemy is jamming
our transmissions.

02:51.899 --> 02:53.248
We are on our own.

03:03.901 --> 03:06.929
Have those countainers searched
and all weapons prepped and loaded.

03:07.233 --> 03:09.481
Have the battalion ready
to move out in 12 hours.

03:09.738 --> 03:11.367
We're advancing on the capital.

03:11.492 --> 03:14.097
Sir, should I try to get
a message to general Kenobi?

03:14.222 --> 03:15.889
Shouldn't we coordinate our attack,

03:16.014 --> 03:18.146
especially in light
of the recent threat?

03:18.271 --> 03:20.999
General Kenobi has his hands full,
same as us.

03:21.124 --> 03:23.712
We need to throw everything
we have at them... Now!

03:23.837 --> 03:26.251
We'd be marching
into a blast zone, sir.

03:29.038 --> 03:30.425
Blasted insurgents.

03:33.026 --> 03:36.238
I realize you haven't agreed
with all my strategies, captain,

03:36.644 --> 03:39.987
but you are smart enough
and loyal enought to obey my orders.

03:40.727 --> 03:42.217
Now prep those troops!

03:53.483 --> 03:55.993
{pos(192,210)}Those missiles have
a 100-megaton yield.

03:56.277 --> 03:58.112
{pos(192,210)}We won't even make it to the delta.

03:58.280 --> 03:59.440
{pos(192,210)}What can I do?

03:59.723 --> 04:02.456
{pos(192,210)}I've tried to reason with him.
Those are the orders.

04:02.702 --> 04:04.939
{pos(192,210)}Great, another suicide mission.

04:05.064 --> 04:06.725
The capital is too well-armed.

04:06.998 --> 04:09.456
Why does it seem like
he has it out for clones?

04:09.624 --> 04:11.430
I think you're all overreacting.

04:11.673 --> 04:13.985
Obviously general Krell
knows what he's doing.

04:14.218 --> 04:16.908
Do you really think he doesn't
care if he loses men?

04:17.033 --> 04:18.350
I'm not saying that,

04:18.675 --> 04:21.700
but I do think his desire for victory
has blinded him to the fact

04:21.825 --> 04:23.872
that there are lives at stake.

04:24.488 --> 04:27.424
I've never seen a general
with these kinds of casualties.

04:27.549 --> 04:28.714
He's out of control.

04:28.839 --> 04:30.832
He is not acting like the other Jedi.

04:31.126 --> 04:32.730
He has no respect for us.

04:32.898 --> 04:37.109
I don't agree with him either,
but I don't have a better plan.

04:37.405 --> 04:40.416
What about using these starfighters
to destroy the supply ship?

04:40.781 --> 04:42.998
Our fleet has been trying.
The umbarans have it

04:43.123 --> 04:44.863
as protected as the capital.

04:45.118 --> 04:47.016
But we've got their access codes.

04:47.141 --> 04:48.454
And their own hardware.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.503
You were able to crack it?

04:51.162 --> 04:53.681
We can sneak right
past their blockade,

04:53.806 --> 04:55.794
get where our ships can't.

04:57.802 --> 04:59.535
If we take out that supply ship,

04:59.860 --> 05:02.104
Then we cut off arms to the capital.

05:10.936 --> 05:13.018
Sir, with all due respect.

05:13.556 --> 05:16.789
Might I suggest another option
to help us secure the capital?

05:17.400 --> 05:19.008
What would that be, captain?

05:19.361 --> 05:21.680
My men have cracked
the umbaran codes.

05:21.805 --> 05:23.158
With the starfighters,

05:23.283 --> 05:25.874
we could sneak past
the supply ship's defenses.

05:25.999 --> 05:27.346
We take it out,

05:27.471 --> 05:29.161
we cut off the arms to the capital.

05:29.998 --> 05:33.185
And who do you propose
would fly these starfighters?

05:33.438 --> 05:35.729
Are your troops now pilots?

05:36.266 --> 05:38.151
My men may not be pilots, sir,

05:38.276 --> 05:41.401
but they are able
to learn and adapt quickly.

05:41.526 --> 05:43.968
A few of them have already
demonstrated that.

05:44.431 --> 05:47.267
I'm afraid I can't afford
to waste any clones

05:47.392 --> 05:48.889
on frivolous adventures.

05:49.254 --> 05:51.942
We're going to need everyone
to take the capital.

05:53.384 --> 05:54.463
Sir, incoming.

05:54.588 --> 05:56.419
Sector delta. Long-range missiles!

06:18.734 --> 06:23.424
{PUB}The assault on the capital,
will continue as planned.

06:23.768 --> 06:24.882
So that's it?

06:25.007 --> 06:27.553
We just March into those missiles?

06:28.032 --> 06:29.410
There's another option.

06:29.678 --> 06:33.100
We go ahead with our plan
and suffer the consequences.

06:33.544 --> 06:35.420
You would be court-martialed.

06:36.606 --> 06:39.330
If it were up to me
and we had the time and the training,

06:39.455 --> 06:40.964
I would say do it.

06:41.738 --> 06:43.823
But it's out of my hands.
And the truth is,

06:43.948 --> 06:45.529
you are no pilots.

06:45.779 --> 06:48.698
Come on.
If hardcase can fly one of these things,

06:48.971 --> 06:50.005
we all can.

06:50.867 --> 06:52.394
He wasn't really flying.

06:52.519 --> 06:54.195
More like avoiding crashing.

06:54.498 --> 06:56.915
We'll be blasted out of the sky
before we get anywhere.

06:57.206 --> 06:59.492
Not if we're in their fighters.

06:59.836 --> 07:01.628
No one's gonna be shooting at us.

07:03.534 --> 07:05.044
Here comes dogma.

07:06.110 --> 07:07.342
What's going on?

07:08.238 --> 07:09.222
Nothing.

07:19.214 --> 07:21.523
This is about more
than just following orders.

07:22.162 --> 07:24.206
It is. It is about honor.

07:24.865 --> 07:28.238
Where is the honor
in marching blindly to our deaths?

07:28.406 --> 07:30.037
It is not our call.

07:30.616 --> 07:32.483
We are part of something larger.

07:32.608 --> 07:34.703
We are not independent
of one another.

07:34.871 --> 07:37.291
I'm sorry.
I cannot just follow orders

07:37.416 --> 07:38.885
when I know they're wrong,

07:39.010 --> 07:41.125
Especially when lives are at stake.

07:41.652 --> 07:45.013
You will if you support
the system we fight for.

07:45.721 --> 07:46.897
I do support it.

07:47.022 --> 07:47.860
I do. 

07:48.103 --> 07:49.934
But I am not just another number.

07:50.349 --> 07:51.556
None of us are!

07:51.972 --> 07:54.087
Fives, where are you going?

07:54.317 --> 07:56.266
To round up some pilots.

08:11.290 --> 08:13.474
Alright, okay, there.

08:13.599 --> 08:15.817
Try that out.
It should be a little easier. 

08:32.546 --> 08:33.720
What are you doing?

08:33.888 --> 08:35.681
If I knew, I wouldn't be doing it!

08:38.984 --> 08:39.934
Look out!

08:41.832 --> 08:42.774
Great.

08:43.549 --> 08:45.085
This can't get much worse.

08:50.274 --> 08:51.092
Sir,

08:51.217 --> 08:53.843
There appears to be
a disturbance in hangar 9-4.

08:56.077 --> 08:58.318
Trooper, what's going on down there?

08:59.128 --> 09:00.657
- I got this.
- <i>Trooper!</i>

09:00.782 --> 09:02.140
<i>Report, trooper! </i>

09:02.265 --> 09:04.694
Yes, sir, everything's fine
in the hangar, sir.

09:05.309 --> 09:06.941
Nothing's out of control down here.

09:07.066 --> 09:09.566
<i>Then why have
the alarms been triggered.</i>

09:11.745 --> 09:13.650
<i>It's just a drill,
a safety drill, sir. </i>

09:13.775 --> 09:15.853
Safety check occurs at 0600.

09:15.978 --> 09:17.514
Who authorized this drill? 

09:19.309 --> 09:20.191
We are...

09:20.316 --> 09:22.339
{pos(192,220)}decrypting the alien hardware, sir.

09:22.745 --> 09:24.396
{pos(192,220)}A standard operating procedure.

09:27.029 --> 09:28.367
{pos(192,220)}That didn't work.

09:31.529 --> 09:32.569
Who is this?

09:32.694 --> 09:34.497
What's your CT number?

09:38.076 --> 09:39.536
Trooper, identify yourself!

09:39.799 --> 09:41.747
Okay, how about this?

09:49.589 --> 09:51.215
That's gonna leave a mark. 

10:01.691 --> 10:03.172
I'm going down there.

10:06.856 --> 10:07.720
Got it.

10:07.845 --> 10:10.122
I got it. It's easy.
Just level your hands. 

10:15.490 --> 10:18.325
Are you crazy?
You could have gotten us killed! 

10:18.493 --> 10:21.161
Not to mention ruining our hopes
of flying this mission.

10:21.655 --> 10:22.920
It's a malfunction.

10:23.045 --> 10:24.292
No harm done. 

10:24.417 --> 10:26.336
Explain this. Now.

10:28.420 --> 10:30.390
Sir, we were decrypting

10:31.120 --> 10:33.225
The enemy craft when
what appears to be

10:33.350 --> 10:35.300
an enemy booby trap went off.

10:35.590 --> 10:36.760
A booby trap?

10:37.303 --> 10:38.247
Yes, sir.

10:38.372 --> 10:40.637
The fighter went haywire,
and had I not been able

10:40.762 --> 10:43.889
To get control of it
and aim the missile at the doors,

10:44.274 --> 10:46.370
Something worse might have happened.

10:47.292 --> 10:48.656
Is this true?

10:49.976 --> 10:50.929
Yes, sir.

10:51.054 --> 10:52.446
That is what happened, 

10:52.571 --> 10:53.787
No doubt. 

10:55.368 --> 10:58.034
Well, captain rex,
looks like I was correct.

10:58.366 --> 11:02.160
The umbaran fighters
are dangerous and not fit for flight.

11:02.328 --> 11:05.011
But, sir, we now know how they work.

11:05.259 --> 11:06.581
We just need practice.

11:08.371 --> 11:10.234
Lock down these fighters.

11:10.519 --> 11:12.838
I don't want anything else exploding.

11:15.077 --> 11:16.196
Nice work.

11:16.321 --> 11:19.366
Now we know how to fly them
and we won't be able to get near them.

11:19.819 --> 11:22.142
Come on. That won't stop us.

11:22.267 --> 11:23.647
It's just procedure.

11:24.041 --> 11:27.551
We can sneak in and be out
before krell knows anything.

11:29.745 --> 11:33.421
I thought the plan was to destroy
the enemy ship with the fighters,

11:33.546 --> 11:35.192
not blow up our own hangar.

11:35.933 --> 11:37.838
I agree we should go
through with this,

11:37.963 --> 11:40.490
so are you two volunteering
to be my pilots or what?

11:40.756 --> 11:43.813
I'm in, regardless
of the consequences.

11:44.120 --> 11:47.327
Flying these fighters beats blindly
walking into a bunch of missiles,

11:47.843 --> 11:48.705
I'm in.

11:49.070 --> 11:50.500
We just need a plan.

11:50.668 --> 11:52.016
Already got one.

11:52.141 --> 11:54.371
General skywalker blew
up a droid control ship

11:54.496 --> 11:56.817
when he was just a kid
and he told me the trick

11:56.942 --> 12:00.090
was hitting their main reactor
from the inside.

12:01.306 --> 12:03.463
Well, that won't be so tough.

12:09.402 --> 12:11.188
I want a full perimeter sweep.

12:11.474 --> 12:12.812
Be on high alert.

12:17.281 --> 12:19.336
Fives, what are you doing out here?

12:19.461 --> 12:22.077
You should be in the barracks.
I found my pilots.

12:22.202 --> 12:24.242
We're going after that supply ship.

12:24.559 --> 12:26.117
Are you out of your mind?

12:26.396 --> 12:29.539
It's a suicide mission,
Not to mention against orders.

12:29.707 --> 12:31.541
It's the right thing to do.

12:31.800 --> 12:33.361
We have to try.

12:33.628 --> 12:37.264
It sounds like you intend
to go through with it.

12:37.632 --> 12:40.806
If you're going to try to stop us,
we need to know.

12:43.369 --> 12:45.819
I can't help you
when you get caught.

12:46.425 --> 12:48.087
I understand, sir.

13:34.556 --> 13:35.309
Tup!

13:35.822 --> 13:36.690
Wake up!

13:38.674 --> 13:39.505
What?

13:40.001 --> 13:41.451
I'm trying to sleep.

13:41.775 --> 13:43.086
Where are they?

13:44.062 --> 13:45.949
- Who?
- You know.

13:47.827 --> 13:50.537
Don't tell me
they're going to disobey orders.

13:51.994 --> 13:53.476
I didn't say that.

13:56.162 --> 13:58.423
You know we have to tell the general.

13:58.548 --> 14:00.309
No, no, you can't.

14:01.528 --> 14:03.407
We have to tell him.

14:03.636 --> 14:06.778
If we know what they're up to
and we keep our moths shut,

14:07.140 --> 14:10.034
Then we'll be complicit
in their insubordination.

14:10.642 --> 14:12.810
Do you really want to be
court-martialed?

14:18.795 --> 14:19.941
Look, sir!

14:34.792 --> 14:36.865
This thing is trickier
than I imagined.

14:36.990 --> 14:38.418
I hope this is a good idea.

14:38.668 --> 14:40.545
It's better than Krell's plan.

14:42.935 --> 14:45.701
You know, I'm only doing
this because I don't like him.

14:46.041 --> 14:47.469
That's reason enough.

14:48.779 --> 14:50.644
I'm just doing it for fun.

15:00.441 --> 15:01.650
What the...

15:16.332 --> 15:18.833
Try to fly steady. We're going in. 

15:37.372 --> 15:39.354
{PUB}I'm realy not liking this!

15:39.522 --> 15:42.357
Easy, Hardcase.
Don't get an itchy trigger finger.

15:59.293 --> 16:01.459
Looks like they think
we are umbaran, all right.

16:01.938 --> 16:03.357
There's the supply ship.

16:03.482 --> 16:04.629
Follow me.

16:04.797 --> 16:06.147
Let's do this.

16:12.752 --> 16:13.704
Captain.

16:14.057 --> 16:17.183
My flight officer reports
the launch of three starfighters.

16:17.490 --> 16:19.561
I thought I ordered
those ships locked down.

16:19.828 --> 16:21.297
Sorry for the confusion, sir.

16:21.422 --> 16:22.984
I authorized the recon of the

16:23.109 --> 16:25.859
of the Delta in preparation for your
attack on the capital.

16:26.112 --> 16:27.810
You took it under your own authority

16:27.935 --> 16:29.988
to lunch sych a reconnaissance?

16:30.156 --> 16:31.087
Yes, sir.

16:31.212 --> 16:34.075
I am sure the report will make
your strategy more effective.

16:34.243 --> 16:37.251
I want that report...
As soon as they are back!

16:46.205 --> 16:47.797
Where are you two going?

16:49.427 --> 16:51.801
I asked you a question, troopers.

16:51.969 --> 16:54.068
We are going to speak
with the general, sir.

16:54.639 --> 16:56.166
Regarding what?

16:56.641 --> 16:58.358
A personal matter.

16:58.962 --> 17:00.492
Why don't you tell me?

17:00.617 --> 17:02.812
And I'll report it to the general.

17:03.580 --> 17:05.181
On second thought, sir,

17:05.306 --> 17:07.079
{pos(192,220)}It's not important.

17:10.676 --> 17:12.843
{pos(192,220)}Yeah, that's what I thought.

17:23.401 --> 17:25.960
Break time is over.
Get back to work.

17:32.555 --> 17:34.344
What? Intruders!

17:37.389 --> 17:39.933
Sir, there are clones
in the main hangar.

17:40.313 --> 17:41.251
Impossible.

17:41.376 --> 17:44.396
The probability
of that is 10,003 to 1.

17:51.404 --> 17:53.742
Why they had to go and do that?

18:05.006 --> 18:06.915
Sir, we have to *** that there are three

18:10.131 --> 18:12.090
Strengthen our defenses.

18:12.836 --> 18:14.092
Reactor core locked.

18:14.666 --> 18:16.095
Prepare missiles.

18:17.180 --> 18:18.735
Fire missiles!

18:20.766 --> 18:22.434
Activate ray shields.

18:22.602 --> 18:23.643
Roger, roger.

18:26.230 --> 18:28.311
Ray shields... hit the deck!

18:31.194 --> 18:33.862
This may have been
a bad idea after all.

18:34.030 --> 18:35.280
Intruder alert.

18:40.908 --> 18:42.746
Our shield are *** taking a beating.

18:45.945 --> 18:47.435
We can't turn back now!

18:49.808 --> 18:50.841
Cover me!

18:51.297 --> 18:53.381
Hardcase!
Get back in your ship!

18:53.549 --> 18:55.216
Trust me, I got a plan.

18:58.975 --> 19:00.900
This is for the 501st.

19:01.025 --> 19:02.307
Don't wait for me.

19:02.475 --> 19:03.808
Hardcase! No!

19:04.550 --> 19:06.788
You've disobeyed enough
orders today, sir.

19:06.913 --> 19:09.859
Follow this one: Get out of here!

19:15.321 --> 19:17.864
If I know hardcase, we better leave.

19:28.776 --> 19:31.002
Let to fight another day boys.

19:31.331 --> 19:33.129
Live to fight another day.

19:40.721 --> 19:41.731
Come on!

20:14.559 --> 20:15.773
They did it!

20:17.594 --> 20:19.551
Where's hardcase?

20:20.460 --> 20:21.761
He didn't make it.

20:22.133 --> 20:23.972
We couldn't have done it without him.

20:31.981 --> 20:34.767
General Krell would like to
see them in the tower.

20:40.620 --> 20:42.782
You wanted to see them, sir.

20:43.702 --> 20:44.589
Indeed.

20:47.335 --> 20:50.342
It seems they have accomplished
a very brave act.

20:50.606 --> 20:51.893
Unfortunately,

20:52.117 --> 20:54.210
they've also committed
a serious crime

20:54.378 --> 20:56.671
by directly disobeying my order.

20:57.166 --> 20:58.737
With all due respect, sir,

20:58.862 --> 21:01.520
The order to attack
the cargo Vessel was mine.

21:01.895 --> 21:05.119
If there's a punishment to be given,
it should be directed toward me.

21:05.244 --> 21:07.277
- I'm their commanding officer.
- General, sir,

21:07.402 --> 21:09.272
Captain rex is attempting
to take the blame

21:09.397 --> 21:11.561
- for actions that were clearly mine.
- Fives!

21:11.960 --> 21:13.838
I request that his admission of guilt

21:13.963 --> 21:16.620
be denied and full blame
placed upon me.

21:17.223 --> 21:18.064
Do you?

21:18.875 --> 21:21.238
You willfully countermand
my direct order,

21:21.765 --> 21:24.935
and now you have
the audacity to request

21:25.060 --> 21:27.896
who should bear the punishment
of your insurrection!

21:29.477 --> 21:32.160
Let me be clear about
the punishment for the treason

21:32.285 --> 21:35.001
committed by ARC Trooper 5555

21:35.169 --> 21:36.978
and CT-5597.

21:37.880 --> 21:39.471
They will be court-martialed,

21:39.596 --> 21:43.977
they will be found guilty,
and they will be executed.

21:46.293 --> 21:47.783
Make no mistake.

21:48.564 --> 21:53.274
For crossing me,
you will pay the price.
