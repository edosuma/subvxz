Who was it this
time, Danielle?

00:55.577 --> 00:56.839
There wasn't anyone...

00:56.882 --> 00:58.493
Quit lying to me!

00:58.536 --> 00:59.798
I'm telling the truth!

00:59.842 --> 01:01.539
We'll see about that...

01:11.549 --> 01:12.637
Let me go!

01:12.681 --> 01:14.422
Where are you
gonna go, Danielle?

01:14.465 --> 01:15.814
Away from you!

01:15.858 --> 01:16.989
You're pathetic,
no one's gonna take you in.

01:17.033 --> 01:18.426
I said let me go!

01:18.469 --> 01:19.601
Get back here!

01:42.841 --> 01:43.973
Hi darling.

01:44.016 --> 01:45.583
Ma, what are
you doing?

01:45.627 --> 01:47.759
You know we pay the
gardener for this.

01:50.066 --> 01:51.372
I know, son.

01:51.415 --> 01:54.940
Whatever Ma, I don't have
time for this right now.

02:07.997 --> 02:09.693
Where were you?

02:09.738 --> 02:11.435
I didn't hear
you come in.

02:11.479 --> 02:13.437
Well, I'm in.

02:13.481 --> 02:17.485
You could at least try to
be here when I get home.

02:24.013 --> 02:26.494
Danielle...

02:26.537 --> 02:30.019
who do we know in
the 5-2-0 area code?

02:31.760 --> 02:33.588
You're checking
the phone bill?

02:33.631 --> 02:36.591
We have unlimited calling.

02:36.634 --> 02:38.593
Who do you
know in Tucson?

02:38.636 --> 02:39.942
Maybe your mom
knows someone there.

02:39.985 --> 02:41.073
I mean it's her house.

02:41.117 --> 02:43.075
Dani, who do you
know in Tucson?

02:43.119 --> 02:44.903
I don't know
anyone in Tucson.

02:44.947 --> 02:46.949
Just like you didn't
know anybody in Santa Fe?

02:46.992 --> 02:47.950
How did you...?

02:47.993 --> 02:49.908
Oh come on, Danielle!

02:49.952 --> 02:53.825
You're not as clever
as you think you are.

02:53.869 --> 02:58.613
You never wondered
why he stopped calling?

02:58.656 --> 02:59.962
What did you do?

03:00.005 --> 03:02.965
I didn't do anything.

03:03.008 --> 03:07.665
But the guy that I hired,
now he did a number on him.

03:07.709 --> 03:09.972
I think it's time that
we give Mr. Tucson

03:10.015 --> 03:11.974
here the same message.

03:14.716 --> 03:18.154
Maybe this time you'll learn
a lesson about respect.

03:42.570 --> 03:45.660
Come on, we're gonna
go for a little walk.

03:46.922 --> 03:50.578

just an innocent bystander.

05:20.972 --> 05:23.888
Well, this year I
wised up and I told Becky

05:23.932 --> 05:27.109
she could only invite her
nearest and dearest friends.

05:27.152 --> 05:30.982
By the way, I really
appreciate your date

05:36.814 --> 05:39.643
His brother is
married to my sister.

But he's a lawyer,
just moved back in town,

05:43.168 --> 05:46.258
and is recently divorced.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.132
Birthday cake!

05:52.743 --> 05:55.006

really good burgers.

the cake now?

I finally did it.

07:01.986 --> 07:03.205
Did what?

07:03.248 --> 07:05.337
I killed him, just

No, no... he was
acting crazy.

07:12.214 --> 07:16.261
He said he was gonna hurt
the baby and I had to stop him.

07:16.305 --> 07:18.873
Okay, you call the cops?

Same with the phone.

of mean to her.

Danielle has made

14:36.571 --> 14:39.313
a lot of bad
choices in life.

14:39.356 --> 14:41.576
But mistakes happen.
That's what you say.

14:41.619 --> 14:44.274
But they're not mistakes
if you do them on purpose.

14:44.318 --> 14:45.841
And if you do
them knowing that

14:45.885 --> 14:47.582
they're going to
hurt other people,

14:47.625 --> 14:49.410
well, that's what
your aunt does.

14:49.453 --> 14:50.759
She seems nice.

14:50.802 --> 14:52.804
Maybe you're right,
maybe she's changed.

Doctor says she'll
be fine as soon as

15:34.672 --> 15:36.805

down a little more.

16:04.398 --> 16:05.312
You okay?

16:05.355 --> 16:06.530
Yeah, I'm fine.

16:06.574 --> 16:09.316
Just my baby got sick,
but she's fine now.

16:09.359 --> 16:12.841
Baby? You brought
your baby with you?

16:12.884 --> 16:14.756
Well... yeah.

16:14.799 --> 16:16.671
When you said you
wanted to be with me,

16:16.714 --> 16:18.368
I thought you
meant just you.

16:18.412 --> 16:19.761
But she's my baby...

16:19.804 --> 16:21.893
I'm not going on
the run with a kid.

16:21.937 --> 16:24.679
You got a decision
to make, me or her.

16:24.722 --> 16:26.898
If you want my help,
I'll swing by

16:26.942 --> 16:29.336

couple of minutes.

16:29.379 --> 16:32.643

front... alone.

16:53.664 --> 16:56.798
This isn't the life
I wanted for you.

16:56.841 --> 16:59.540
You know that, right?

16:59.583 --> 17:03.805
I thought we'd have
a daddy and a house

17:03.848 --> 17:07.765
and everything
would be great.

17:07.809 --> 17:11.726
Then your mom went and
fell for somebody else.

17:14.642 --> 17:16.557
So...

17:19.777 --> 17:21.997
I'm so sorry.

17:23.651 --> 17:25.782
I'm so sorry...

17:27.394 --> 17:30.832
Just remember I'm always
gonna be your mommy.

17:30.875 --> 17:34.401
I'm always gonna
be your mommy.

talk to a lawyer,

21:21.149 --> 21:23.020

know part of the story...

21:23.064 --> 21:25.675
It's not a problem.
Glad to help.

21:25.719 --> 21:28.896
I just came from Las Cruces,
as you can see...

21:28.939 --> 21:31.899
You have a baby.

21:31.942 --> 21:35.032
Not what I was expecting
when you called.

21:36.904 --> 21:39.907
So, umm...

21:39.950 --> 21:42.083
what am I going to do?

21:42.126 --> 21:43.998
What do you
want to do?

21:44.041 --> 21:46.043
Scream.

21:50.091 --> 21:53.660
Danielle is probably going to
be charged with manslaughter.

21:53.703 --> 21:56.227
She's claiming that she
was protecting the baby,

21:56.271 --> 21:58.055
but a jury may
not buy that.

21:58.099 --> 21:59.927
And it will be tough
for the prosecution

21:59.970 --> 22:02.016
to prove a
premeditated murder.

22:02.059 --> 22:03.713
And the baby?

22:03.757 --> 22:05.976
Your sister was captured leaving
the hospital without her child.

22:06.020 --> 22:08.152
Which means technically,
she abandoned the baby.

22:08.196 --> 22:10.111
Now because she did
so at a hospital,

22:10.154 --> 22:11.765
that falls under
Safe Haven law.

22:11.808 --> 22:13.288
No charges will be
filed against her.

22:13.332 --> 22:15.899
But child services is likely
to rule that doing so

22:15.943 --> 22:17.292
means she gave up
her parental rights.

22:17.336 --> 22:18.859
And the father is dead?

22:18.902 --> 22:20.426
Right.

22:20.469 --> 22:24.821
So technically, the baby has
no legal parents right now.

22:24.865 --> 22:27.781
Child services will next
look to a suitable relative

22:27.824 --> 22:29.652
to place the child with.

22:29.696 --> 22:31.828
Me...

22:31.872 --> 22:34.091
And the grandmother?

22:34.135 --> 22:35.310
Beatrice.

22:35.354 --> 22:37.704
I just got off
the phone with her.

22:37.747 --> 22:39.706
First, there's her age.

22:39.749 --> 22:42.143
Secondly, Danielle
just killed her son.

22:42.186 --> 22:44.798
She is a wreck and there's
no way she can take a baby.

22:44.841 --> 22:46.930
Ultimately that's gonna
be up to child services,

22:46.974 --> 22:49.019
but that leaves you.

22:54.155 --> 22:56.766
Well...

22:56.810 --> 22:58.899
or the other option.

23:12.869 --> 23:14.175
Nikki?

23:14.218 --> 23:16.090
Hey.

23:18.919 --> 23:20.181
Hey you guys.

23:20.224 --> 23:21.791
Oh, so precious.

23:21.835 --> 23:23.271
Oh my gosh.

23:23.314 --> 23:25.752
Hey sweetie, I'm heating up
a bottle in the kitchen.

23:25.795 --> 23:26.753
Could you go get it?

23:26.796 --> 23:27.754
Okay.

23:27.797 --> 23:28.929
Thank you.

23:28.972 --> 23:30.887
Hi, hi!

23:32.367 --> 23:35.065
Well, you didn't
waste any time.

23:35.109 --> 23:37.024
Well, what am I
supposed to do?

23:37.067 --> 23:41.289
Danielle is going to prison
and I can't take the child.

23:41.332 --> 23:43.073
If you put her
up for adoption,

23:43.117 --> 23:44.379
Becky's going
to be heartbroken.

23:44.423 --> 23:46.337
I know.

23:46.381 --> 23:47.948
Can I feed her?

23:47.991 --> 23:49.123
Thank you!

23:49.166 --> 23:52.126
Yeah, I guess
you're old enough.

23:52.169 --> 23:54.781
Okay so, you
need to cradle her

23:54.824 --> 23:58.088
in your arms like you
do with your dolls.

24:00.308 --> 24:03.137
Good, wow.

24:03.180 --> 24:04.921
You're going to
make a great mom.

24:04.965 --> 24:06.401
That was my
birthday wish.

24:06.445 --> 24:10.840
I'm so happy my
birthday wish came true.

24:10.884 --> 24:12.233
Thank you so
much Millie,

24:12.276 --> 24:13.364
for picking her
up from school.

24:13.408 --> 24:14.453
Yeah.

24:14.496 --> 24:16.237
Hey Becky, will
you do me a favor

24:16.280 --> 24:19.153
and walk Millie out
for me? Thank you.

24:19.196 --> 24:22.025
Oh my goodness, I know.

24:22.069 --> 24:24.288
Thank you,
thanks Millie.

24:24.332 --> 24:25.942
Yeah.

24:27.074 --> 24:29.293
Boy oh boy oh boy.

24:34.081 --> 24:37.388
Hey...
there you go.

25:03.893 --> 25:05.329
These are the
custody papers.

25:05.373 --> 25:08.115
They state that you are giving
up your parental rights

25:08.158 --> 25:11.118
and your sister, Nikki,
will legally adopt the baby.

25:11.161 --> 25:12.946
You will not have
the right to interfere

25:12.989 --> 25:15.992
with Nikki's
raising of the child.

25:22.999 --> 25:24.827
You knew.

25:24.871 --> 25:27.090
You knew that you
could abandon your baby

25:27.134 --> 25:28.788
and I would take her in.

25:28.831 --> 25:31.007
That I would
clean up your mess.

25:31.051 --> 25:32.618
That's right.

25:32.661 --> 25:34.402
I knew Saint Nikki would save
the family screw up once again.

25:34.445 --> 25:36.273
Why did you kill him?

25:36.317 --> 25:37.927
Why didn't
you just leave?

25:37.971 --> 25:41.017
Because I'm not the kind of
mother they give custody to.

25:41.061 --> 25:42.410
And I couldn't risk
him getting custody

25:42.453 --> 25:45.326
when I knew he
would hurt the baby.

25:45.369 --> 25:47.415
And I didn't think any
character witnesses

25:47.458 --> 25:50.026
would speak on my behalf.

25:50.070 --> 25:52.420
That's right, Danielle.

25:52.463 --> 25:54.465
You're my
sister and I love you,

25:54.509 --> 25:58.208
but I can't think of one
good thing to say about you.

26:02.256 --> 26:04.345
Give her a
good life, Nikki.

26:04.388 --> 26:06.434
Make sure she's happy.

26:26.976 --> 26:37.291
♪ Upbeat dance music

26:37.334 --> 26:46.343
♪ Upbeat dance music

27:04.057 --> 27:06.450
What do you think?
What do you think?

27:12.239 --> 27:15.895
Mommy, is Grandma
Beatrice coming?

27:15.938 --> 27:17.331
Sweetie, you know
she can't drive

27:17.374 --> 27:19.028
because of her
eye sight, right?

27:19.072 --> 27:20.464
I know, I just miss her.

27:20.508 --> 27:22.902
Well, she did
send you a present.

27:22.945 --> 27:24.425
Is it a puppy?

27:24.468 --> 27:26.949
That's what she wished for
when she blew the candles out.

27:26.993 --> 27:28.385
Hey! It was supposed
to be a secret.

27:28.429 --> 27:31.475
Like she doesn't
already know.

27:31.519 --> 27:34.261
Let's go look
at the presents.

27:35.305 --> 27:38.047
Now, where were we?

27:41.572 --> 27:43.574
Who's this creep
with the camera?

27:43.618 --> 27:45.315
What?

27:46.316 --> 27:48.144
Hey!

28:03.246 --> 28:05.292
He was on a public
street, but you know.

28:05.335 --> 28:08.034
An older guy watching little
kids leave a birthday party...

28:08.077 --> 28:10.123
No Jacob, I
completely understand.

28:10.166 --> 28:12.386
I'll run his description
through the database.

28:12.429 --> 28:15.476
Listen, something similar
happened last year.

28:15.519 --> 28:18.566
Turned out to be a divorced
dad who missed his son.

28:18.609 --> 28:20.046
Yeah.

28:20.089 --> 28:21.525
Yeah, maybe that's it.

28:21.569 --> 28:22.526
Thanks.

28:22.570 --> 28:23.527
You bet.

28:23.571 --> 28:24.354
See ya.

28:24.398 --> 28:25.616
See you.

29:27.374 --> 29:29.158
Hey wait, you
didn't have breakfast.

29:29.202 --> 29:30.377
I made pancakes.

29:30.420 --> 29:31.465
I'm not hungry.

29:31.508 --> 29:33.467
But you love pancakes!

29:33.510 --> 29:36.470
Okay, what did
I do this time?

29:36.513 --> 29:38.167
Now is not the time.

29:38.211 --> 29:39.299
It's never the time.

29:39.342 --> 29:41.344
Okay, now
is the time.

29:41.388 --> 29:43.390
Look, Jacob
is my husband.

29:43.433 --> 29:46.523
But he's not trying
to replace your father.

29:46.567 --> 29:48.090
Could have fooled me.

29:48.134 --> 29:49.352
He's my dad.

29:49.396 --> 29:51.311
Becky!

30:01.408 --> 30:05.368
Please do not grow up
to be a bratty teenager.

30:05.412 --> 30:06.630
No promises.

30:06.674 --> 30:07.718
Ugh!

30:07.762 --> 30:10.330
All right, get your stuff.

30:17.250 --> 30:18.164
Got it?

30:18.207 --> 30:19.252
Yup.

31:08.736 --> 31:11.870
Next time I ask you if
you have your lunch,

31:11.913 --> 31:15.395
be sure to check if you
actually have your lunch.

32:28.729 --> 32:31.688
Hey... can you
come over here?

32:31.732 --> 32:34.300
I think someone
broke into the house.

32:34.343 --> 32:37.303
No, I'm just sure.

32:37.346 --> 32:40.436
The door was open, but
I'm sure that I closed it.

32:40.480 --> 32:41.916
And Cali's bear...

32:41.960 --> 32:44.701
...you know how she
always wants him

32:44.745 --> 32:47.443
to face her while
she's sleeping...

32:47.487 --> 32:49.706
but he's not.

32:49.750 --> 32:52.927
They're fine,
they're in the car.

33:02.719 --> 33:04.765
He's here.

33:04.808 --> 33:06.636
Hey!

33:19.867 --> 33:21.782
You guys all right?

33:29.833 --> 33:33.533
Well guys, there's no
sign of forced entry.

33:34.577 --> 33:37.667
The alarm system's working.

33:39.539 --> 33:41.323
What do you
think he wanted?

33:41.367 --> 33:42.585
I don't know, Nikki.

33:42.629 --> 33:44.805
We ran his description,
but came up empty.

33:44.848 --> 33:46.633
There have been a few
break-ins in the area,

33:46.676 --> 33:50.680
but not by anybody even
close in age to your guy.

33:50.724 --> 33:52.030
You're a lawyer, Jacob.

33:52.073 --> 33:53.640
Anyone want to
get back at you?

33:53.683 --> 33:55.511
No, but I'll check
with the other partners.

33:55.555 --> 33:56.860
See if they've had
anything similar happen.

33:56.904 --> 33:57.861
All right.

33:57.905 --> 33:59.733
I'll go check with
your neighbors.

33:59.776 --> 34:02.518
The best I can do right now
is have extra patrol cars

34:02.562 --> 34:04.042
swing by as often
as they can.

34:04.085 --> 34:05.391
Thanks.

34:05.434 --> 34:06.827
Jacob.

34:06.870 --> 34:08.697
Nikki.

34:11.049 --> 34:12.485
Ooh!

34:13.529 --> 34:14.878
You going to
be warm enough?

34:14.922 --> 34:15.922
Yeah.

34:15.966 --> 34:17.925
Tuck you in.

34:19.447 --> 34:22.364
Is Mister Bear
watching me?

34:22.408 --> 34:25.367
He sure is sweetie.

34:25.411 --> 34:27.021
We're all watching you.

34:28.804 --> 34:30.371
Okay, love you.

34:30.416 --> 34:30.851
Love you too!

34:30.893 --> 34:31.895
Good night.

34:31.938 --> 34:32.809
Good night!

35:20.466 --> 35:23.643
Hey, you won't believe
who I just saw.

35:23.686 --> 35:25.514
Yes, how did you know?

35:25.558 --> 35:26.776
I made some phone calls.

35:26.820 --> 35:28.038
She was a model prisoner.

35:28.082 --> 35:29.997
But why weren't
we notified?

35:30.040 --> 35:32.695
Only the victim's family
would've gotten a call.

35:32.739 --> 35:34.741
And that means
Beatrice, not us.

35:34.784 --> 35:36.525
Apparently they've released
her to a halfway house

35:36.569 --> 35:37.874
for the remainder
of her sentence.

35:37.918 --> 35:39.615
A halfway house, where?

35:39.659 --> 35:41.530
I've got the address.

35:41.574 --> 35:44.577
Oh God...
text it to me.

36:27.489 --> 36:28.925
Hi Nikki.

36:28.969 --> 36:30.884
What are you
doing here?

36:30.927 --> 36:31.972
It's my turn
to do dishes.

36:32.015 --> 36:34.496
What are you
doing here?

36:34.540 --> 36:35.802
They assigned me here.

36:35.845 --> 36:37.760
I guess they thought
it would be helpful

36:37.804 --> 36:39.849
to be near family to help
with rehabilitation.

36:39.893 --> 36:41.068
You didn't suggest it?

36:41.111 --> 36:42.678
No, believe me.

36:42.722 --> 36:45.942
A place that Cali lives
just a few miles from?

36:45.986 --> 36:48.684
I was the one that told
you not to bring her

36:48.728 --> 36:50.773
to the prison because
it would frighten her.

36:50.817 --> 36:53.776
You're her mom.
I get it, believe me.

36:53.820 --> 36:55.517
And when I've
done my time,

36:55.561 --> 36:57.998
I will move away and I'll
leave a forwarding address

36:58.041 --> 37:01.741
and if she never wants to
contact me, I'll understand.

37:04.787 --> 37:07.616
I'll keep that in mind.

37:07.660 --> 37:09.618
Great.

37:12.012 --> 37:14.797
Come on, you
have a second?

37:14.841 --> 37:16.756
You want to look around?

37:16.799 --> 37:18.540
Sure.

37:19.933 --> 37:21.587
These are the snacks.

37:21.630 --> 37:25.112
Everything's free, and
that's where we sleep.

37:25.155 --> 37:27.680
The drinks,
which aren't free,

37:27.723 --> 37:30.900
and then this
is the kitchen.

37:34.034 --> 37:37.820
So at least tell me,

37:37.864 --> 37:40.127
is she a happy kid?

37:40.170 --> 37:45.959
She's a happy little girl,
everyone loves her.

37:46.002 --> 37:48.701
I'm glad to see that
you're doing so good.

37:48.744 --> 37:50.224
Yeah.

38:11.724 --> 38:13.726
I heard you got out.

38:13.769 --> 38:15.205
Gunnar?

38:15.249 --> 38:17.686
Oh my God,
oh my God.

38:22.125 --> 38:25.128
Oh I've missed,
I've missed smelling you.

38:25.172 --> 38:27.914
Oh my God, come on...

38:42.189 --> 38:45.061
Seven years in prison
is totally worth it

38:45.105 --> 38:47.629
if it means we get to
be together like this.

38:47.673 --> 38:49.239
I missed you too.

38:49.283 --> 38:51.198
What's the deal
with this place?

38:51.241 --> 38:56.116
I just have to put in my time,
and then I'm free and clear.

38:56.159 --> 38:59.902
Speaking of which, you have
to leave in like 20 minutes.

38:59.946 --> 39:01.121
Yeah, sure.

39:01.164 --> 39:02.731
They'll kick you out.

39:02.775 --> 39:03.950
But once you're
free and clear,

39:03.993 --> 39:07.083
then you and me can...

39:07.127 --> 39:08.781
We can go wherever we want.

39:08.824 --> 39:11.305
We can do anything we want.

39:11.349 --> 39:16.223
What about your kid?

39:16.266 --> 39:17.659
She's with my sister.

39:17.703 --> 39:19.139
You don't have
to worry about her.

39:19.182 --> 39:20.793
No, I...

39:20.836 --> 39:23.230
I've been
thinking lately that,

39:23.273 --> 39:26.059
maybe she wasn't
Junior's.

39:26.102 --> 39:28.191
What do you mean?

39:28.235 --> 39:32.195
I was with you a lot
more during that time

39:32.239 --> 39:34.937
than I was with Junior.

39:34.981 --> 39:37.070
Are you saying
she might be mine?

39:37.113 --> 39:39.725
All I can say is maybe.

39:39.768 --> 39:41.683
I don't know anything.

39:41.727 --> 39:42.945
Well no.

39:42.989 --> 39:44.686
I've been thinking
lately, you know?

39:44.730 --> 39:46.079
I'm getting older.

39:46.122 --> 39:48.777
Might be nice to have
someone to take to the zoo.

39:48.821 --> 39:50.213
Teach to fish.

39:50.257 --> 39:51.737
Do you mean it?

39:51.780 --> 39:53.129
Yeah.

39:53.173 --> 39:55.741
Yeah, I was wrong,
Danielle.

39:55.784 --> 39:57.264
A kid should be
with her mom.

39:57.307 --> 39:58.831
With you. Us.

39:58.874 --> 40:00.833
You know, maybe we could
get a house somewhere.

40:00.876 --> 40:02.878
Maybe a dog.
Kids love dogs, right?

40:02.922 --> 40:04.837
I want that too.
I want that so much,

40:04.880 --> 40:06.708
I just had to push
it down inside

40:06.752 --> 40:07.970
and pretend I
didn't, because...

40:08.014 --> 40:09.755
...because of me.

40:09.798 --> 40:11.278
I am so sorry, Danielle.

40:11.321 --> 40:14.281
I'm going to do everything
I have to to make it right.

40:14.324 --> 40:16.152
Me too...

40:32.342 --> 40:34.040
Nikki?

40:34.083 --> 40:35.781
Hey!

40:35.824 --> 40:37.783
I thought this
neighborhood looked familiar.

40:37.826 --> 40:40.089
Danielle, what
are you doing here?

40:41.090 --> 40:43.136
All right, family meeting.

40:43.179 --> 40:44.964
Everybody on the couch.

40:45.007 --> 40:47.227
Team, here we go.

40:52.319 --> 40:56.149
Ladies, we have something very
important to talk to you about.

40:56.192 --> 40:57.237
I didn't do it.

40:57.280 --> 40:58.368
Me neither.

40:58.412 --> 41:00.066
No, nobody is in trouble.

41:00.109 --> 41:01.937
I just got one mile to go.

41:01.981 --> 41:04.113
Your house looks
great by the way.

41:04.157 --> 41:06.376
You just happen to be
jogging by my house

41:06.420 --> 41:09.205
at the exact moment I'm
outside getting my mail?

41:09.249 --> 41:10.468
I just want to see her.

41:10.511 --> 41:12.121
Aunt Danielle's out?

41:12.165 --> 41:12.992
When?

41:13.035 --> 41:14.036
Last week.

41:14.080 --> 41:15.864
She moved to
a place nearby

41:15.908 --> 41:18.127
and she wants to have
a visit with you.

41:18.171 --> 41:19.433
She does?

41:19.477 --> 41:21.870
Oh my God, you know it
wasn't even 24 hours ago

41:21.914 --> 41:23.393
you were feeding
me that bull.

41:23.437 --> 41:25.221
It wasn't bull,
I meant it.

41:25.265 --> 41:27.049
I didn't contact
you for seven years,

41:27.093 --> 41:29.269
and then all of a sudden
you show up at my place

41:29.312 --> 41:31.227
and fill my head
with thoughts of Cali.

41:31.271 --> 41:34.230
What did you
expect would happen?

41:34.274 --> 41:35.928
It will be her decision.

41:35.971 --> 41:38.104
I'm just asking
that you ask her.

41:38.147 --> 41:39.932
Why? I already
have a mommy.

41:39.975 --> 41:41.455
Well, we're not going
to do anything

41:41.499 --> 41:43.152
that you're not
comfortable with.

41:43.196 --> 41:44.197
That's why we're talking.

41:44.240 --> 41:45.938
But it has to
be on her terms.

41:45.981 --> 41:46.852
Of course.

41:46.895 --> 41:48.288
I need to feel her out.

41:48.331 --> 41:51.160
Well, let's see how she
does at the halfway house.

41:51.204 --> 41:54.381
Give her some time and if you
wanna do it, just let me know.

41:54.424 --> 41:56.818
How's that?

42:00.909 --> 42:02.955
Fine, I will ask her.

42:02.998 --> 42:04.913
Thank you!
Thank you, thank you!

42:04.957 --> 42:08.221
I mean it, don't
do this again, okay?

42:08.264 --> 42:10.484
You wait for me
to contact you.

42:10.528 --> 42:12.051
Yeah.

43:11.414 --> 43:13.068
Hey!

43:13.112 --> 43:16.942
Hey, I thought
you'd be glad to see me.

43:16.985 --> 43:18.944
I am, I just had
a really hard

43:18.987 --> 43:21.294
first session, so...

43:21.337 --> 43:24.950
Well, I was hoping
you'd call me back.

43:24.993 --> 43:29.476
I got tickets to the circus.

43:29.519 --> 43:31.913
Kids love the
circus, right?

43:31.957 --> 43:33.349
Oh, yeah.
No sure.

43:33.393 --> 43:35.221
When is it?
Because...

43:35.264 --> 43:36.526
I have to call her.

43:36.570 --> 43:38.137
No, it's tonight.

43:38.180 --> 43:39.355
Tonight?

43:39.399 --> 43:41.357
Yeah?
Is that a problem?

43:41.401 --> 43:44.404
We can go pick her up
after school, right?

44:35.673 --> 44:38.632
Throw the ball to your
friends, they're waiting.

44:41.461 --> 44:44.029
Do you know who I am?

44:45.204 --> 44:47.467
What did Nikki
tell you about me?

44:47.510 --> 44:50.296
That you were in jail
for a long time

44:50.339 --> 44:52.298
and before that
you had a baby.

44:52.341 --> 44:54.300
Do you know who
that baby is?

44:54.343 --> 44:55.997
That's me.

44:56.041 --> 44:57.999
That's right.

44:58.043 --> 45:00.001
I think about you
so much, Cali.

45:00.045 --> 45:02.134
I love you so much.

45:02.177 --> 45:06.573
Hush little baby,
don't say a word.

45:06.616 --> 45:09.445
Do you remember
that song?

45:09.489 --> 45:13.536
I used to sing that to you all
the time when you were a baby.

45:13.580 --> 45:15.364
I don't remember.

45:15.408 --> 45:16.931
I do.

45:16.975 --> 45:20.021
I used to feed you and I used
to put you to bed every night.

45:20.065 --> 45:21.457
Because I was your mommy.

45:21.501 --> 45:23.111
I am your mommy!

45:23.155 --> 45:25.026
Do you want to
call me mommy?

45:25.070 --> 45:26.593
Mommy.

45:26.636 --> 45:28.334
Mommy is my mommy.

45:28.377 --> 45:29.552
No!

45:29.596 --> 45:31.250
Don't you want to be
with your real mommy?

45:31.293 --> 45:33.121
I mean, we could do
whatever you want.

45:33.165 --> 45:34.644
Do you want to go
to the circus?

45:34.688 --> 45:37.125
We could go to the circus.
I have tickets, we could go.

45:37.169 --> 45:39.562
Cali, we could go to
the circus right now.

45:39.606 --> 45:41.216
Do you want to come?

45:41.260 --> 45:44.350
Cali, do you want
to go to the circus?

45:44.393 --> 45:45.568
Come on!

45:45.612 --> 45:47.396
I want to go back
and play now.

45:47.440 --> 45:49.659
No Cali, you have to listen to
me because I'm your mommy.

45:49.703 --> 45:52.097
No!

45:52.140 --> 45:53.620
What are you doing?
I had her!

45:53.663 --> 45:54.795
Are you crazy?

45:54.839 --> 45:56.362
You were going to
snatch and grab her

45:56.405 --> 45:57.667
off the playground in
broad daylight?

45:57.711 --> 45:59.278
You're the one that
said we should get her.

45:59.321 --> 46:01.280
Yeah, I thought she was
going to come with us.

46:01.323 --> 46:03.282
I didn't know you had
to kidnap your own kid!

46:03.325 --> 46:05.501
I almost had
my baby back.

46:17.600 --> 46:20.125
All right...

46:20.168 --> 46:21.517
this look nice!

46:24.477 --> 46:25.478
For you.

46:25.521 --> 46:26.653
Thank you.

46:26.696 --> 46:28.350
Mommy?

46:28.394 --> 46:31.179
How come we're not
going to the circus?

46:31.223 --> 46:34.530
That's because Becky
is afraid of clowns.

46:34.574 --> 46:36.358
They're terrifying!

46:36.402 --> 46:38.404
The makeup and
the weird hair...

46:38.447 --> 46:39.622
I don't know,

46:39.666 --> 46:42.190
I guess I just didn't
think of it, sweetie.

46:42.234 --> 46:44.366
Why the sudden interest
in the circus, Cali?

46:44.410 --> 46:48.501
My other Mommy
said she'd take me.

46:48.544 --> 46:50.242
You mean your
birth mother?

46:50.285 --> 46:52.722
Yeah, she said she'd
take me there tonight.

46:52.766 --> 46:54.376
When did she
talk to you?

46:54.420 --> 46:56.552
At school today.
On the playground.

46:56.596 --> 46:59.468
Oh my God, Danielle
was at the school.

46:59.512 --> 47:00.513
You saw her?

47:00.556 --> 47:01.819
Mom.

47:01.862 --> 47:04.212
I was on the playground
and she talked to me.

47:04.256 --> 47:05.561
Tell me exactly
what happened.

47:05.605 --> 47:07.215
Mom, don't scare her.

47:07.259 --> 47:11.176
Becky, be quiet.
This is important.

47:11.219 --> 47:14.222
Go ahead and start
from the beginning.

47:16.485 --> 47:19.662
Just...
what did she say?

47:19.706 --> 47:22.796
She said she would take
me and I would love it.

47:26.539 --> 47:29.411
I'm going to send her
a letter citing the law,

47:29.455 --> 47:31.413
telling her we're not
gonna call the cops yet.

47:31.457 --> 47:33.459
But if she comes within
100 feet of Cali again,

47:33.502 --> 47:35.113
we'll have no choice.

47:35.156 --> 47:36.505
Then it's on her.

47:36.549 --> 47:39.595
It won't be your fault
if she screws up again.

47:39.639 --> 47:40.640
Okay?

47:40.683 --> 47:43.121
Okay.

47:43.164 --> 47:44.687
Thanks.

47:51.520 --> 47:53.783
Mommy!

48:02.531 --> 48:05.404
Do you want to
play hide and seek?

48:10.800 --> 48:12.411
Cali?

48:13.412 --> 48:15.327
Cali?

48:20.636 --> 48:22.464
Cali?

48:27.295 --> 48:30.342
Mommy, come and
play with me.

48:31.343 --> 48:34.259
Cali?

48:36.391 --> 48:38.437
I'm going to get you!

48:38.480 --> 48:41.266
You little stinker.

48:44.269 --> 48:45.835
Cali?

48:47.272 --> 48:48.447
Cali, where are you?

48:49.622 --> 48:51.841
Cali?

48:53.539 --> 48:56.324
I'm gonna get you!

48:56.368 --> 48:58.283
Get you!

49:28.400 --> 49:30.315
Hey!

49:35.450 --> 49:36.538
Mommy...

49:36.582 --> 49:38.714
do you remember
my birthday wish?

49:50.944 --> 49:52.424
Hi!

50:04.001 --> 50:05.785
Oh, look at this one.

50:05.828 --> 50:07.395
Did you see this one?

50:07.439 --> 50:09.528
So cute!

50:09.571 --> 50:11.356
Yeah.

50:11.399 --> 50:12.748
You're in trouble now.

50:12.792 --> 50:14.446
Mom!

50:14.489 --> 50:16.491
She's so soft and warm!

50:16.535 --> 50:18.798
We could call
her pancakes.

50:18.841 --> 50:21.627
Everybody loves pancakes.

50:21.670 --> 50:23.455
What do you think, mom?

50:23.498 --> 50:24.804
It was her birthday wish...

50:24.847 --> 50:27.415
Let's go home
and talk about it.

50:27.459 --> 50:29.461
Talk, talk, talk.

50:29.504 --> 50:32.507
Can't we just
do something?

50:32.551 --> 50:35.641
I'll take care
of her, mom!

50:35.684 --> 50:38.513
Okay, look...

50:41.038 --> 50:45.564
You have school tomorrow
and Jacob and I have to work.

50:45.607 --> 50:47.392
If we got the
puppy tonight,

50:47.435 --> 50:49.698
who would take care
of it during the day?

50:49.742 --> 50:52.614
So wouldn't it be better
to get him on a weekend?

50:52.658 --> 50:54.529
When we have everything
ready for him

50:54.573 --> 50:56.923
and we can research
vets and dog walkers

50:56.966 --> 50:59.404
and all that stuff before
we bring him home.

50:59.447 --> 51:00.709
You're kind of no fun.

51:00.753 --> 51:02.537
I know, I know.

51:02.581 --> 51:03.886
Just being a mommy.

51:03.930 --> 51:05.584
Come on you guys,
say goodbye.

51:05.627 --> 51:07.020
Goodbye cuties!

51:09.936 --> 51:12.721
I mean they're
pretty cute, right?

51:18.553 --> 51:19.728
You guys hungry?

51:19.772 --> 51:21.078
I'm hungry.

52:11.954 --> 52:13.565
Mom! Where's
my gym bag?

52:13.608 --> 52:15.697
I don't know, where
did you last see it?

52:15.741 --> 52:16.872
The car.

52:16.916 --> 52:18.918
Take this!

52:21.529 --> 52:22.965
I'm coming.

52:23.009 --> 52:23.879
Mom?

52:23.923 --> 52:25.577
Yeah?

52:27.622 --> 52:29.668
Oh, where did
that come from?

52:31.017 --> 52:33.802
Mommy!
Thank you!

52:33.846 --> 52:35.456
You didn't buy it?

52:35.500 --> 52:36.631
No.

52:36.675 --> 52:39.504
This is the best
birthday present ever!

52:40.635 --> 52:43.638
So it's just a coincidence
that the exact dog

52:43.682 --> 52:45.074
Cali was looking
at last night

52:45.118 --> 52:46.902
showed up on our
doorstep this morning.

52:46.946 --> 52:48.730
Oh my God, I
bet she loved it!

52:48.774 --> 52:49.601
Did you take pictures?

52:49.644 --> 52:50.906
Danielle!

52:50.950 --> 52:52.517
Okay, fine.

52:52.560 --> 52:53.822
I read Jacob's letter...

52:53.866 --> 52:55.520
I never got
closer than 100 feet.

52:55.563 --> 52:56.695
She didn't even see me.

52:56.738 --> 52:58.087
You were within 100
feet this morning.

52:58.131 --> 52:59.828
You left the dog
on the porch!

52:59.872 --> 53:01.743
There was a door
between us.

53:01.787 --> 53:03.702
Jeez, you cannot
be serious.

53:03.745 --> 53:05.617
You just don't
get it, do you?

53:05.660 --> 53:07.967
No, we set up rules to see
if you could follow them.

53:08.010 --> 53:10.796
If you followed the rules,
you would be rewarded.

53:10.839 --> 53:12.754
But... God, Danielle,

53:12.798 --> 53:15.888
every time you go out
of your way to prove

53:15.931 --> 53:18.891
that you're the most
selfish, untrustworthy--

53:18.934 --> 53:20.980
What goes on in that head
of yours, Danielle?

53:21.023 --> 53:23.025
I really want to know.

53:23.069 --> 53:25.767
It's not my head,
it's my heart!

53:25.811 --> 53:28.683
It's my heart, Nikki!

53:28.727 --> 53:31.686
I understand, Danielle, but
she doesn't want to see you.

53:31.730 --> 53:32.992
You didn't even ask her!

53:33.035 --> 53:34.080
I did!

53:34.123 --> 53:35.603
You're a liar!

53:35.647 --> 53:37.605
I want my daughter back!

53:39.216 --> 53:42.088
When I adopted Cali,
let her into my heart...

53:42.131 --> 53:45.004
I made an unspoken vow to
protect her no matter what.

53:45.047 --> 53:47.180
And if that means
sending you to prison,

53:47.224 --> 53:49.226
that's what I'm gonna do.

54:12.945 --> 54:13.772
You ready?

54:13.815 --> 54:14.642
Yeah.

54:14.686 --> 54:15.861
All right.

54:41.843 --> 54:43.062
Grandma!

54:48.720 --> 54:50.025
Hello, sweetie.

54:50.069 --> 54:52.724
Oh look, you
have a puppy!

54:53.942 --> 54:54.900
How's my girl?

54:54.943 --> 54:55.901
Good.

54:57.119 --> 54:58.947
I need to talk
to your mommy.

54:58.991 --> 55:00.862
So why don't go
outside and play

55:00.906 --> 55:03.125
with your puppy and I'll
see you in a minute.

55:03.169 --> 55:04.910
Okay. Love you.

55:04.953 --> 55:06.041
Love you too.

55:06.085 --> 55:07.304
Bye.

55:17.618 --> 55:19.794
You hired a goon to
break into my house?

55:19.838 --> 55:22.057
Mr. Holt is
hardly a goon.

55:22.101 --> 55:25.147
He's a highly respected
private detective.

55:25.191 --> 55:29.891
He also doubles as my driver,
which is a waste of his talents,

55:29.935 --> 55:32.764
but very helpful to me.

55:32.807 --> 55:35.070
Why would you hire someone
to break into my home?

55:35.114 --> 55:36.942
I thought that we had
a good relationship.

55:36.985 --> 55:38.247
We do.

55:38.291 --> 55:39.901
You're a wonderful person.

55:39.945 --> 55:42.861
I always enjoy your company
when you bring Cali around.

55:42.904 --> 55:45.167
Which could be a
little more often,

55:45.211 --> 55:48.127
but I suppose every
grandma thinks that.

55:48.170 --> 55:50.782
You know Nikki, there was
a brief period of time

55:50.825 --> 55:52.740
when I actually
loved your sister.

55:52.784 --> 55:54.742
Thought she'd be
good for my boy.

55:54.786 --> 55:56.657
But then she exposed
her true nature.

55:56.701 --> 55:58.224
She said your son
was a danger to Cali.

55:58.267 --> 56:00.226
And yet she took
a plea bargain.

56:00.269 --> 56:02.794
Because she's a born
liar who knew the truth.

56:02.837 --> 56:06.101
And she knew that stabbing
a man in the back

56:06.145 --> 56:08.147
usually doesn't make
you look innocent.

56:08.190 --> 56:10.976
Why are you here, Beatrice?

56:11.019 --> 56:13.935
To see if you still have a soft
spot in your heart for Danielle.

56:13.979 --> 56:15.676
No, I don't trust
her one bit.

56:15.720 --> 56:17.852
And yet a moment
ago it sounded

56:17.896 --> 56:20.028
as if you just might
believe her story.

56:20.072 --> 56:22.857
Which is why I
hired Mr. Holt.

56:22.901 --> 56:25.773
When Danielle killed
my son, she ran here.

56:25.817 --> 56:27.732
When I heard she was
getting out of prison,

56:27.775 --> 56:29.690
I wanted to see if you were
going to take her in again.

56:29.734 --> 56:30.996
Well, I haven't.

56:31.039 --> 56:32.867
You folks put a lock on
that school gate yet?

56:32.911 --> 56:35.261
More spying?

56:35.304 --> 56:37.698
For all your
bluster about how

56:37.742 --> 56:39.308
you don't want her
around your family,

56:39.352 --> 56:41.833
there she is,
around your family.

56:41.876 --> 56:44.270
Specifically Cali.

56:46.011 --> 56:48.709
She's your sister
and you're never

56:48.753 --> 56:50.885
truly going to cut
her off, are you?

56:50.929 --> 56:52.365
What is this?

56:52.409 --> 56:55.107
My application with the
court to take custody of Cali.

56:55.150 --> 56:57.892
You can't be serious,
Cali is my daughter.

56:57.936 --> 56:59.764
Who you have endangered
by allowing her

56:59.807 --> 57:02.767
to have unsupervised contact
with a convicted killer.

57:02.810 --> 57:04.769
My God, Nikki,
she snapped once,

57:04.812 --> 57:06.335
don't you think she
could do it again?

57:06.379 --> 57:08.947
Beatrice, you're going blind,
you can't take care of Cali.

57:08.990 --> 57:10.775
Macular degeneration.

57:10.818 --> 57:13.212
It limits me, but
I'm not going blind.

57:13.255 --> 57:15.127
Besides, I can
hire good help.

57:15.170 --> 57:17.085
My husband is a lawyer,
so you won't succeed.

57:17.129 --> 57:18.913
I have lawyers too.

57:18.957 --> 57:21.960
And I just need a sympathetic
judge who's more worried

57:22.003 --> 57:24.266
about the welfare of
a seven year old girl

57:24.310 --> 57:27.139
than your
sister's feelings.

57:27.182 --> 57:30.011
You see, dear, I'm old
and I'm falling apart.

57:30.055 --> 57:31.839
And at this point
in my life,

57:31.883 --> 57:34.842
the only person I
care about is Cali.

57:34.886 --> 57:40.195
Then why are you trying
to take her away from me?

57:40.239 --> 57:45.374
Because it's just a matter of
time before somebody else does.

57:49.378 --> 57:52.033
What choice do
I have, Nikki?

57:52.077 --> 57:54.122
What choice have
you left me?

57:57.256 --> 57:59.214
I'm going to go play
with my granddaughter

57:59.258 --> 58:02.391
for a few minutes...
while I still can.

58:16.275 --> 58:18.146
Pancakes!

58:39.907 --> 58:41.343
Nikki will cause
some trouble,

58:41.387 --> 58:44.956
but I'll make sure Cali
knows the dog came from me.

58:44.999 --> 58:47.349
She loves the dog,
she'll love me.

58:47.393 --> 58:49.047
So, I was thinking...

58:49.090 --> 58:51.179
you've still got time to
do at the halfway house.

58:51.223 --> 58:53.094
Maybe I should head
out to California.

58:53.138 --> 58:54.922
Get some work for a bit.

58:54.966 --> 58:57.011
I can come back when
you're free and clear.

58:57.055 --> 59:00.145
Maybe you can sort things
out with the kid by then.

59:00.188 --> 59:02.843
Yeah, that makes
a lot of sense.

59:04.932 --> 59:07.892
Let's get some
chips to go with this.

59:35.310 --> 59:37.835
Cash!

59:37.878 --> 59:39.401
Now!

59:39.445 --> 59:42.013
Do it!

01:00:19.572 --> 01:00:22.053
What the hell was that?

01:00:22.096 --> 01:00:24.316
Huh? And where did
you get a gun?

01:00:24.359 --> 01:00:26.361
It's easy to get a gun in
a house full of criminals.

01:00:26.405 --> 01:00:27.972
And that...
was insurance.

01:00:28.015 --> 01:00:29.103
What are you
talking about?

01:00:29.147 --> 01:00:30.191
I don't think the
security cameras

01:00:30.235 --> 01:00:31.453
got a good look
at my face,

01:00:31.497 --> 01:00:32.541
but you really stood out.

01:00:32.585 --> 01:00:34.065
Are you crazy?

01:00:34.108 --> 01:00:36.023
Seven years ago, you told me
that we could be together

01:00:36.067 --> 01:00:38.286
if I could find a way to
get rid of my husband.

01:00:38.330 --> 01:00:39.505
No, I said--

01:00:39.548 --> 01:00:41.376
And then you said that
I should dump my baby.

01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:43.248
And now you're coming
back into my life

01:00:43.291 --> 01:00:44.989
and you're making
a lot of promises

01:00:45.032 --> 01:00:46.381
and they are promises
that you're gonna keep.

01:00:46.425 --> 01:00:48.209
Because if I have
to do this alone,

01:00:48.253 --> 01:00:50.603
and I get caught,
I'm gonna tell the cops

01:00:50.647 --> 01:00:53.345
exactly who did the
convenience store job.

01:00:55.390 --> 01:00:58.132
We are gonna be a
family with my daughter.

01:00:58.176 --> 01:01:00.395
And you're going to
help me make that happen.

01:01:03.398 --> 01:01:05.139
Good.

01:01:07.576 --> 01:01:10.231
Now, my sister is
becoming a problem.

01:01:10.275 --> 01:01:14.061
We have to find a way to bypass
Nikki and get Cali alone.

01:01:23.331 --> 01:01:25.551
She's not wrong,
you know.

01:01:25.594 --> 01:01:28.249
So she could
just take Cali?

01:01:28.293 --> 01:01:29.816
No, this is a
nuisance filing.

01:01:29.860 --> 01:01:32.471
She's not wrong about Danielle
being a bad influence on Cali.

01:01:32.514 --> 01:01:34.342
I tried to
keep her away.

01:01:34.386 --> 01:01:36.127
I did everything
I could.

01:01:36.170 --> 01:01:38.259
She just sticks her nose
where it's not welcome.

01:01:38.303 --> 01:01:40.131
Honey, your instincts
about her are always right,

01:01:40.174 --> 01:01:41.306
but you never
follow through.

01:01:41.349 --> 01:01:43.134
You want me to
send her to jail?

01:01:43.177 --> 01:01:44.570
If that's what
it takes, then yes.

01:01:44.613 --> 01:01:46.180
Nikki, she won't listen!

01:01:46.224 --> 01:01:48.530
She thinks she's being
cute now with this dog thing.

01:01:48.574 --> 01:01:50.184
She can stay a
hundred feet away,

01:01:50.228 --> 01:01:52.491
but that dog ensures that Cali
is always thinking about her.

01:01:52.534 --> 01:01:54.101
We're not getting
rid of the dog!

01:01:54.145 --> 01:01:55.712
That's not
what I'm saying.

01:01:55.755 --> 01:01:57.670
Look, the only reason we had
a creepy guy taking our picture

01:01:57.714 --> 01:02:02.631
and running around in our
home is because of Danielle.

01:02:02.675 --> 01:02:05.547
Face it, if we get
Danielle out of our lives,

01:02:05.591 --> 01:02:08.637
we rid ourselves of
most of our problems.

01:02:20.475 --> 01:02:23.391
Oh, no, teacher, do I
get a written warning now?

01:02:23.435 --> 01:02:25.219
No, that's a court
order moving you

01:02:25.263 --> 01:02:27.221
to another
halfway house.

01:02:27.265 --> 01:02:28.570
This is halfway
across the state.

01:02:28.614 --> 01:02:30.137
How would I get
to see Cali?

01:02:30.181 --> 01:02:31.573
That's the point,
you can't.

01:02:31.617 --> 01:02:33.358
You got a couple days to
get your things together.

01:02:33.401 --> 01:02:35.360
The van picks you up
Friday, 9 a.m. sharp.

01:02:35.403 --> 01:02:38.537
If you're not ready,
bad things happen for you.

01:02:53.247 --> 01:02:55.162
...the white ball to
hit the stripey ball

01:02:55.206 --> 01:02:56.468
in the pocket, okay?

01:02:56.511 --> 01:02:58.383
Hit it like that.

01:02:58.426 --> 01:03:00.515
Hey, there you go!

01:03:02.691 --> 01:03:07.131
Okay, so we need to
talk about Danielle.

01:03:07.174 --> 01:03:08.262
Again?

01:03:08.306 --> 01:03:11.570
Yes. This is the
last time, I promise.

01:03:11.613 --> 01:03:14.355
She is going to be
moved to a different city.

01:03:14.399 --> 01:03:15.269
Far away.

01:03:15.313 --> 01:03:16.488
Why?

01:03:16.531 --> 01:03:18.316
Because she was bad,
and when you're bad,

01:03:18.359 --> 01:03:19.447
there are consequences.

01:03:19.491 --> 01:03:21.101
Like when she
went to jail?

01:03:21.145 --> 01:03:22.624
Exactly.

01:03:22.668 --> 01:03:25.192
We told her not to contact
you and to keep away from us.

01:03:25.236 --> 01:03:27.107
And she did not
follow those rules.

01:03:27.151 --> 01:03:31.155
So it's very important
that if Danielle comes around,

01:03:31.198 --> 01:03:34.636
you say no and then you
find daddy or Becky or me.

01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:37.117
But my other
mommy is a grown up.

01:03:37.161 --> 01:03:39.206
Why does she have
to follow rules?

01:03:39.250 --> 01:03:40.599
Oh, for God's sake.

01:03:40.642 --> 01:03:42.253
Your birth mom
does stupid things

01:03:42.296 --> 01:03:43.254
and she's a
bad influence.

01:03:43.297 --> 01:03:44.385
Becky!

01:03:44.429 --> 01:03:45.691
There, I just saved
us half an hour.

01:03:45.734 --> 01:03:47.736
What is going
on with you?

01:03:47.780 --> 01:03:51.131
How did I do at
the science fair?

01:03:51.175 --> 01:03:52.741
That's right, you
didn't even know

01:03:52.785 --> 01:03:54.439
there was a
science fair.

01:03:54.482 --> 01:03:55.614
Because everything
is about Cali now.

01:03:55.657 --> 01:03:57.485
That is not true!

01:03:57.529 --> 01:04:00.488
This situation
affects the whole family.

01:04:04.275 --> 01:04:07.669
I liked it better when the
family was just you and me.

01:04:09.846 --> 01:04:12.761
Sorry, squirt.
I just...

01:04:16.374 --> 01:04:18.419
Becky...

01:04:19.464 --> 01:04:21.248
Sorry, Cali.

01:04:21.292 --> 01:04:22.206
She's a...

01:04:22.249 --> 01:04:24.295
A teenager?

01:04:24.338 --> 01:04:27.167
Yeah... yeah.

01:04:51.626 --> 01:04:53.541
Hey.

01:04:53.585 --> 01:04:55.848
I think I found
a way around Nikki.

01:04:57.328 --> 01:04:58.503
Where have you been?

01:04:58.546 --> 01:04:59.504
Out.

01:04:59.547 --> 01:05:00.722
Becky...

01:05:00.766 --> 01:05:03.508
Mom, have I ever
not come home?

01:05:03.551 --> 01:05:05.640
Have I ever not gotten
all my homework done?

01:05:05.684 --> 01:05:07.555
Have I ever not
gotten straight A's?

01:05:07.599 --> 01:05:09.383
I think you can
give me some space.

01:05:09.427 --> 01:05:10.558
You hurt your sister.

01:05:10.602 --> 01:05:12.212
If you hate
your stepfather...

01:05:12.256 --> 01:05:13.474
I don't hate Jacob.

01:05:13.518 --> 01:05:15.215
Then what?

01:05:15.259 --> 01:05:18.436
Jacob didn't know dad...
and Cali never met dad.

01:05:18.479 --> 01:05:20.481
It's like I'm the only
one who remembers him.

01:05:20.525 --> 01:05:22.222
Oh, really?

01:05:22.266 --> 01:05:23.702
And what about me?

01:05:23.745 --> 01:05:25.617
I used to hear you talk to
his picture all the time.

01:05:25.660 --> 01:05:27.532
When's the last
time you did?

01:05:27.575 --> 01:05:28.881
Exactly.

01:05:28.925 --> 01:05:32.276
He's been replaced in
the family by someone new.

01:05:32.319 --> 01:05:33.451
If I disappeared tomorrow,

01:05:33.494 --> 01:05:34.582
would you just
replace me too?

01:05:34.626 --> 01:05:36.323
Becky...

01:05:36.367 --> 01:05:37.672
Becky!

01:05:53.340 --> 01:05:55.299
Mommy?

01:05:55.342 --> 01:05:57.562
Is Danielle
a bad person?

01:06:00.782 --> 01:06:02.915
I don't know if
she's a bad person.

01:06:02.959 --> 01:06:04.699
But she's done
some bad things.

01:06:04.743 --> 01:06:07.572
Does that mean
I'll do bad things?

01:06:07.615 --> 01:06:09.356
Is that what
you're worried about?

01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:10.792
That because your
birth mother is one way,

01:06:10.836 --> 01:06:13.360
you're gonna be
that way too?

01:06:13.404 --> 01:06:15.449
Oh, come here.

01:06:17.408 --> 01:06:19.540
Well...

01:06:19.584 --> 01:06:22.369
it is really
up to you, angel.

01:06:22.413 --> 01:06:24.502
Everyone gets to
make their own choices.

01:06:24.545 --> 01:06:27.722
And hopefully, I've raised
you to make the right ones.

01:06:27.766 --> 01:06:28.593
Yeah?

01:06:28.636 --> 01:06:29.724
Yeah!

01:06:29.768 --> 01:06:31.813
Yeah... I think
you're gonna be great.

01:06:31.857 --> 01:06:33.772
Thank you.

01:07:17.468 --> 01:07:19.383
Wait here.

01:07:34.528 --> 01:07:36.487
Hey, Becky.

01:07:36.530 --> 01:07:38.619
So awesome to run
into you like this.

01:07:38.663 --> 01:07:40.708
Isn't it a
beautiful day?

01:07:40.752 --> 01:07:42.362
What are you doing?

01:07:42.406 --> 01:07:45.365
I was just out for a walk,
but this is great.

01:07:45.409 --> 01:07:46.932
It gives me a
chance to talk.

01:07:46.975 --> 01:07:48.803
Let me guess, you want
to talk about Cali?

01:07:48.847 --> 01:07:51.545
No, about you.

01:07:51.589 --> 01:07:54.548
We're family and there's so
much about you I don't know.

01:07:54.592 --> 01:07:56.376
Really?

01:07:56.420 --> 01:07:57.812
Like what?

01:08:16.962 --> 01:08:21.358
...And then your mom threw up
all over the cafeteria floor.

01:08:21.401 --> 01:08:22.533
No way!

01:08:22.576 --> 01:08:23.881
Yeah.

01:08:23.925 --> 01:08:27.407
I know, little Miss
Perfect, right?

01:08:27.451 --> 01:08:29.627
You know Becky, I've made
a lot of stupid mistakes,

01:08:29.670 --> 01:08:32.499
but I'm not a monster.

01:08:32.542 --> 01:08:33.761
I know...

01:08:52.693 --> 01:08:53.868
It's like with the dog.

01:08:53.912 --> 01:08:55.566
I thought I'd get
the dog for Cali

01:08:55.609 --> 01:08:58.002
and it would
make her happy.

01:08:58.046 --> 01:08:59.874
I was just...

01:08:59.917 --> 01:09:01.702
I didn't think how
that would affect you.

01:09:01.746 --> 01:09:03.529
Oh, we all
love the dog.

01:09:03.573 --> 01:09:04.836
I'm glad.

01:09:04.879 --> 01:09:06.054
Is Cali doing her part?

01:09:06.098 --> 01:09:07.707
Is she walking him?
Is she feeding him?

01:09:07.752 --> 01:09:09.710
Oh my gosh, she
loves walking the dog.

01:09:09.754 --> 01:09:11.625
Every afternoon
around dinner time,

01:09:11.669 --> 01:09:15.716
we take him to the dog park
down the street for a bit.

01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:18.719
I cannot imagine your mom
sitting around a dog park.

01:09:18.763 --> 01:09:19.938
She doesn't.

01:09:19.981 --> 01:09:21.548
It's usually just
Cali and me.

01:09:21.591 --> 01:09:22.767
That sounds nice.

01:09:22.810 --> 01:09:24.943
A little sister
alone time.

01:09:24.986 --> 01:09:29.077
Well, I should let you
get back to studying.

01:09:29.121 --> 01:09:33.647
I am so glad we had a
chance to talk like this.

01:09:46.006 --> 01:09:47.051
We're good to go.

01:09:47.095 --> 01:09:49.620
We can do it today.

01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:12.817
Come on, let's take
Pancakes for a walk.

01:10:12.860 --> 01:10:14.993
I don't know, I'm
feeling kind of sleepy.

01:10:15.036 --> 01:10:16.690
Please?

01:10:16.734 --> 01:10:17.691
Okay.

01:10:17.735 --> 01:10:18.736
Yeah!

01:10:19.954 --> 01:10:22.522
Why don't we all go?

01:10:22.566 --> 01:10:25.003
It's okay, I think we
need some sister alone time.

01:10:25.046 --> 01:10:27.005
Yeah, sister
alone time.

01:10:27.048 --> 01:10:29.964
Okay well, be
back before dinner.

01:10:30.008 --> 01:10:31.879
And it's getting dark
early, so be sure to...

01:10:31.923 --> 01:10:33.272
Yes, mom.

01:10:33.316 --> 01:10:35.970
We'll be sure to look
before crossing the street.

01:10:46.024 --> 01:10:48.113
Stay close, Cali.

01:10:50.811 --> 01:10:52.117
Hey, I'm serious!

01:11:07.741 --> 01:11:08.829
Hi, Cali.

01:11:10.657 --> 01:11:13.660
Oh, hi.

01:11:13.704 --> 01:11:15.662
What's your dog's name?

01:11:15.706 --> 01:11:17.185
Pancakes...

01:11:17.229 --> 01:11:21.799
Well, you and Pancakes are
going to go on a ride with me.

01:11:21.842 --> 01:11:23.017
Aunt Danielle,
what're you doing?

01:11:23.061 --> 01:11:24.628
Cali!

01:11:25.629 --> 01:11:26.978
Aunt Danielle,
what're you doing?

01:11:27.021 --> 01:11:28.719
Becky, help!

01:11:28.762 --> 01:11:30.851
Becky!

01:11:30.895 --> 01:11:32.636
Stop!

01:11:32.679 --> 01:11:34.072
No!

01:11:40.731 --> 01:11:44.256
Okay, tell me about the car and
I can get an Amber Alert out.

01:11:46.693 --> 01:11:48.695
Becky, it's important.

01:11:48.739 --> 01:11:49.957
It's my fault.

01:11:50.001 --> 01:11:51.132
What's your fault?

01:11:51.176 --> 01:11:52.656
It's all my fault!

01:11:52.699 --> 01:11:54.048
No sweetie,
it's gonna be okay.

01:11:54.092 --> 01:11:55.223
There was nothing
you could do.

01:11:55.267 --> 01:11:57.704
No, you don't understand.

01:11:57.748 --> 01:12:00.011
She told me she wanted
to get to know me better.

01:12:00.054 --> 01:12:02.709
I told her about how we
walk the dog after dinner.

01:12:02.753 --> 01:12:06.017
I'm so sorry mom!

01:12:06.060 --> 01:12:07.932
You were right
about Danielle.

01:12:07.975 --> 01:12:09.803
She's a monster.

01:12:09.847 --> 01:12:11.283
If anything happens to
Cali I'll kill myself...

01:12:11.327 --> 01:12:13.720
Whoa, no no no.

01:12:13.764 --> 01:12:16.070
Don't talk like that.

01:12:16.114 --> 01:12:17.985
We're going to
get Cali back.

01:12:18.029 --> 01:12:19.770
We're going to keep
this family whole.

01:12:19.813 --> 01:12:21.206
Hey!

01:12:21.249 --> 01:12:23.077
Do you understand?

01:12:23.121 --> 01:12:25.993
My sister is such
a tricky person.

01:12:26.037 --> 01:12:28.126
She gets people to
believe her all the time.

01:12:28.169 --> 01:12:31.651
I always fall
for her lies.

01:12:31.695 --> 01:12:35.742
But you, you just need
to be strong right now, okay?

01:12:35.786 --> 01:12:39.920
So you can help us
help your sister.

01:12:39.964 --> 01:12:42.880
Listen Becky, the
first minutes are crucial.

01:12:42.923 --> 01:12:44.142
I need any information
on the car

01:12:44.185 --> 01:12:47.014
so I can put out
the Amber Alert.

01:12:48.276 --> 01:12:50.888
Okay.

01:12:50.931 --> 01:12:53.804
Two doors.

01:12:53.847 --> 01:12:55.893
One of those cars guys
are always working on.

01:12:55.936 --> 01:12:56.937
A muscle car?

01:12:56.981 --> 01:12:58.765
Yeah.

01:12:58.809 --> 01:13:00.724
Maybe I could look
at some pictures

01:13:00.767 --> 01:13:02.943
and see if I
can pick it out.

01:13:02.987 --> 01:13:06.773
That would be
such a big help.

01:13:06.817 --> 01:13:08.906
You're doing so good.

01:13:22.876 --> 01:13:24.835
Get me a coffee
or something.

01:13:24.878 --> 01:13:27.228
It's not that
kind of pit stop.

01:13:37.282 --> 01:13:39.240
How much is this?

01:13:39.284 --> 01:13:41.025
$1.29.

01:14:05.136 --> 01:14:09.314
Hush little baby,
don't say a word.

01:14:09.357 --> 01:14:12.796
Mama's gonna buy
you a mockingbird.

01:14:12.839 --> 01:14:16.713
If that mockingbird
don't sing,

01:14:16.756 --> 01:14:20.804
daddy's gonna buy
you a diamond ring.

01:14:20.847 --> 01:14:23.850
If that diamond
ring don't--

01:14:30.335 --> 01:14:32.424
You... you have
to be okay.

01:14:35.949 --> 01:14:38.343
You can just do this.

01:15:28.001 --> 01:15:29.437
Hey.

01:15:30.482 --> 01:15:31.788
What did you do?

01:15:31.831 --> 01:15:32.963
You were taking so long,

01:15:33.006 --> 01:15:34.965
I didn't know if you
needed some help.

01:15:50.067 --> 01:15:51.198
Why haven't you
done it yet?

01:15:51.242 --> 01:15:53.461
Shut up!

01:15:53.505 --> 01:15:54.854
Where's Cali?

01:15:54.898 --> 01:15:56.203
She's asleep in the car.

01:15:56.247 --> 01:15:57.509
You left her alone?

01:16:05.299 --> 01:16:07.040
You idiot!

01:16:07.084 --> 01:16:09.521
I swear she was
fast asleep.

01:16:15.179 --> 01:16:17.007
Cali!

01:16:18.008 --> 01:16:19.357
Cali!

01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:20.924
Cali!

01:16:29.149 --> 01:16:31.108
How long?

01:16:34.938 --> 01:16:36.504
14 hours.

01:16:57.134 --> 01:17:00.485
Please don't
let them hurt her.

01:17:00.528 --> 01:17:02.487
Please.

01:17:02.530 --> 01:17:07.013
I promise I will do
better next time.

01:17:07.057 --> 01:17:11.235
And I won't let Danielle
hurt her ever again.

01:17:11.278 --> 01:17:16.457
So if you could just
talk to someone up there?

01:17:19.547 --> 01:17:22.507
I'm counting on you, dad.

01:17:25.075 --> 01:17:26.990
Hey...

01:17:27.033 --> 01:17:29.035
I'm so sorry.

01:17:47.967 --> 01:17:49.490
Who is he?
Did he take Cali?

01:17:49.534 --> 01:17:52.015
He's your
sister's boyfriend.

01:17:52.058 --> 01:17:53.973
Look, I'm bending
some rules here,

01:17:54.017 --> 01:17:55.671
but I need you
to come with me.

01:18:01.067 --> 01:18:02.590
Where is she?
Where is my daughter?

01:18:02.634 --> 01:18:04.288
Nikki, listen to me.

01:18:04.331 --> 01:18:05.463
Listen!

01:18:05.506 --> 01:18:07.204
We found him driving
near Whitney and Main

01:18:07.247 --> 01:18:08.771
and we ran his info.

01:18:08.814 --> 01:18:11.382
His car matched the one used
in a convenience store robbery.

01:18:11.425 --> 01:18:15.342
The security tape shows him and
your sister leaving the scene.

01:18:15.386 --> 01:18:17.127
But it was before
they took Cali.

01:18:17.170 --> 01:18:19.303
Then where the
hell is my daughter?

01:18:19.346 --> 01:18:21.261
Tell her what you
told me, Gunnar.

01:18:21.305 --> 01:18:23.089
I don't know.

01:18:23.133 --> 01:18:24.395
After Danielle and
I picked up Cali,

01:18:24.438 --> 01:18:26.179
we drove around
for awhile.

01:18:26.223 --> 01:18:28.181
We stopped to get some gas
and get her some food,

01:18:28.225 --> 01:18:30.967
when we came back her
and the dog were gone.

01:18:31.010 --> 01:18:34.535
Danielle and I split up
and then Danielle was gone.

01:18:34.579 --> 01:18:36.363
That's it?

01:18:36.407 --> 01:18:38.191
That's all you've got?

01:18:38.235 --> 01:18:40.150
Some deadbeat who can't
even keep up with a child,

01:18:40.193 --> 01:18:41.499
let alone my crazy sister?

01:18:41.542 --> 01:18:43.501
I know, but we've got
an APB out on Danielle,

01:18:43.544 --> 01:18:44.415
and an Amber Alert on--

01:18:44.458 --> 01:18:47.331
Then you've got nothing!

01:18:47.374 --> 01:18:51.074
I will continue to
look for her on my own.

01:18:51.117 --> 01:18:54.207
What kind of an animal
kidnaps a child like that?

01:18:54.251 --> 01:18:56.166
Danielle told me that
Cali might be mine.

01:18:56.209 --> 01:18:58.559
Really?
Did you get any proof?

01:18:58.603 --> 01:19:01.040
Yeah, that's what
I thought.

01:19:01.084 --> 01:19:02.563
She played you.

01:19:02.607 --> 01:19:04.565
Danielle was right.

01:19:04.609 --> 01:19:06.393
Cali belongs
with her real mom.

01:19:06.437 --> 01:19:08.265
That's right you bastard.

01:19:08.308 --> 01:19:10.180
I'm right here.

01:19:20.059 --> 01:19:21.452
Should we go to the
store where she disappeared?

01:19:21.495 --> 01:19:22.801
Look around?

01:19:22.845 --> 01:19:24.281
They've already got a lot
of people doing that.

01:19:24.324 --> 01:19:26.283
We should go back to the
house in case Danielle calls.

01:19:26.326 --> 01:19:28.459
No, she would
call me on my cell.

01:19:28.502 --> 01:19:30.069
Then we should go search.

01:19:30.113 --> 01:19:32.071
I hate to say this,
but I really think we need

01:19:32.115 --> 01:19:34.421
to change our approach and
try something different.

01:19:34.465 --> 01:19:36.641
The silver car.

01:19:36.684 --> 01:19:38.599
He followed
Danielle everywhere.

01:19:38.643 --> 01:19:40.253
Who followed Danielle?

01:19:40.297 --> 01:19:41.602
The guy who was
in our house.

01:19:41.646 --> 01:19:43.300
He drove a silver car
just like that one.

01:19:43.343 --> 01:19:44.388
I don't understand.

01:19:44.431 --> 01:19:46.172
Beatrice knew
Danielle's every move.

01:19:46.216 --> 01:19:48.305
Knew that she saw Cali
at school that day

01:19:48.348 --> 01:19:50.307
because she hired
him to follow her.

01:19:50.350 --> 01:19:51.569
So?

01:19:51.612 --> 01:19:53.353
So, when was the last
time that you looked

01:19:53.397 --> 01:19:55.312
into the backseat of someone's
car when you passed by?

01:19:55.355 --> 01:19:56.966
Never.

01:19:57.009 --> 01:19:59.403
So whoever took Cali must have
known that she was in the car.

01:19:59.446 --> 01:20:00.708
It wasn't just some
random stranger.

01:20:00.752 --> 01:20:02.493
You think he managed
to track Danielle?

01:20:02.536 --> 01:20:05.452
Yes and I think he waited
for his chance to grab her.

01:20:05.496 --> 01:20:06.714
It's a long shot.

01:20:06.758 --> 01:20:08.455
But we've got
to take it, right?

01:20:08.499 --> 01:20:09.761
Yeah, let's go.

01:20:36.614 --> 01:20:39.791
If I'm not back
in three minutes,

01:20:39.835 --> 01:20:41.445
come in,
call the cops.

01:20:41.488 --> 01:20:42.794
Okay.

01:20:56.764 --> 01:20:58.766
I miss my mommy.

01:20:58.810 --> 01:21:01.204
Oh honey, I know.

01:21:01.247 --> 01:21:02.596
I know you do.

01:21:03.859 --> 01:21:05.556
I'm right here, sweetie.

01:21:05.599 --> 01:21:06.731
Mommy?

01:21:06.774 --> 01:21:08.037
It's okay, Cali.

01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:09.690
We're going to be leaving
in a few moments.

01:21:09.734 --> 01:21:10.996
I don't think so, dear.

01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:13.346
I came here alone so we
could do this quietly

01:21:13.390 --> 01:21:15.218
and not upset
my daughter.

01:21:15.261 --> 01:21:16.741
But if I'm not
back in a few minutes,

01:21:16.784 --> 01:21:18.699
my husband's
gonna call the police.

01:21:18.743 --> 01:21:20.484
Despite my warnings,
you let Danielle

01:21:20.527 --> 01:21:22.442
walk right up to Cali
and kidnap her.

01:21:22.486 --> 01:21:24.575
The only kidnappers
are you two.

01:21:24.618 --> 01:21:26.664
We rescued her from
a dangerous situation

01:21:26.707 --> 01:21:28.535
and we're not going to
return her to a mother

01:21:28.579 --> 01:21:30.624
that leaves her
constantly unattended.

01:21:30.668 --> 01:21:32.713
You must have put a tracking
device on Gunnar's car,

01:21:32.757 --> 01:21:34.454
that's how you
followed them.

01:21:34.498 --> 01:21:35.716
Pretty sure that's illegal.

01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:37.283
Do you want the
cops finding out?

01:21:37.327 --> 01:21:38.502
Let the police come.

01:21:38.545 --> 01:21:40.547
I'm sure they and
the press would be

01:21:40.591 --> 01:21:43.202
more interested to hear
the story of Mr. Holt's

01:21:43.246 --> 01:21:45.552
dramatic rescue of
a neglected little girl.

01:21:45.596 --> 01:21:47.467
I understand why you
did this, to a point.

01:21:47.511 --> 01:21:49.382
But if you don't
let go of my daughter,

01:21:49.426 --> 01:21:51.254
I'm going to beat
you silly.

01:21:51.297 --> 01:21:52.777
You are trespassing
on private property

01:21:52.820 --> 01:21:54.735
and you just threatened
the owner of that property.

01:21:54.779 --> 01:21:57.390
I am well within my rights
to keep you from harming her.

01:21:57.434 --> 01:21:58.391
Now leave.

01:21:58.435 --> 01:21:59.740
Now you're assaulting me?

01:21:59.784 --> 01:22:01.655
I'm not afraid
of you anymore.

01:22:05.877 --> 01:22:06.878
Run to your mother.

01:22:06.922 --> 01:22:07.835
Mommy!

01:22:07.879 --> 01:22:08.836
Cali, get back here!

01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:10.447
Cali, run to the street.

01:22:10.490 --> 01:22:12.753
Daddy and Becky are
waiting for you, okay?

01:22:27.377 --> 01:22:28.769
Get off me!

01:22:28.813 --> 01:22:31.337
I'm not going to let
you hurt my daughter!

01:22:56.623 --> 01:22:59.365
She'll never be
your daughter!

01:23:23.389 --> 01:23:24.695
Cali...

01:23:28.742 --> 01:23:31.571
It's a letter from
your birth mother.

01:23:38.839 --> 01:23:40.841
Look...

01:23:40.885 --> 01:23:43.453
I'm in a tough
position here.

01:23:43.496 --> 01:23:45.933
I don't want my sister to
have a bad influence on you.

01:23:45.977 --> 01:23:47.892
That's why I
sent her to prison.

01:23:47.935 --> 01:23:49.807
But if getting
a letter from her

01:23:49.850 --> 01:23:52.462
makes you angry or
shut the world out,

01:23:52.505 --> 01:23:55.943
I think she's still having
a bad influence on you.

01:23:55.987 --> 01:23:58.990
She tried to steal me
from you and daddy.

01:23:59.034 --> 01:24:00.557
Yes.

01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:03.429
She is not a good person.

01:24:05.953 --> 01:24:10.393
This is really
hard to explain.

01:24:10.436 --> 01:24:11.829
If somebody is sick,

01:24:11.872 --> 01:24:13.874
we don't blame them
for being sick, right?

01:24:13.918 --> 01:24:16.442
That would be mean.

01:24:16.486 --> 01:24:19.924
We just hope that
they get better.

01:24:19.967 --> 01:24:23.536
It's kind of like your
birth mother is sick.

01:24:23.580 --> 01:24:26.713
So she'll get
better some day?

01:24:26.757 --> 01:24:29.629
No sweetie, I
don't think so.

01:24:29.673 --> 01:24:32.589
Look, you don't
have to love her.

01:24:32.632 --> 01:24:35.635
Maybe you don't have
to even like her.

01:24:35.679 --> 01:24:37.550
But I think it's
really important

01:24:37.594 --> 01:24:39.987
that you
don't hate her.

01:24:42.599 --> 01:24:44.688
I don't want
to read it.

01:24:47.473 --> 01:24:48.605
Yet.

01:24:50.824 --> 01:24:53.479
That's my girl.

01:24:58.005 --> 01:25:00.617
I'm so proud of you.

01:25:01.748 --> 01:25:03.707
I'll save this
for later,

01:25:03.750 --> 01:25:05.665
when you're ready.

01:25:20.593 --> 01:25:21.420
Hey!

01:25:21.464 --> 01:25:22.987
Hey, all right...

01:25:26.686 --> 01:25:28.601
