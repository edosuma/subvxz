"Man, how do they get there?"

10:02.917 --> 10:04.916
I'm Dawson Coyle,
I'm 17 years old,

10:04.917 --> 10:07.149
and I'm from Williamstown,
New Jersey.

10:07.150 --> 10:09.516
Growing up, it was just
me and my parents.

10:09.517 --> 10:12.816
We strengthen each other, and
we're all part of a big team.

10:12.817 --> 10:14.216
It's awesome.

10:14.217 --> 10:15.782
I've been homeschooled
since third grade,

10:15.783 --> 10:18.016
and I attend a co-op
on a weekly basis.

10:18.017 --> 10:20.016
Through the co-op,
I got started with music.

10:20.017 --> 10:22.216
I took a 10-week
guitar lesson program,

10:22.217 --> 10:23.216
and I fell in love with it.

10:23.217 --> 10:25.016
It would mean
a tremendous amount

10:25.017 --> 10:27.349
to see a chair turn around

10:27.350 --> 10:30.949
after the year we've had and the
things that he's gone through.

10:30.950 --> 10:32.749
This year has definitely been

10:32.750 --> 10:35.382
the hardest year
of all of our lives.

10:35.383 --> 10:38.349
Me and my parents
had a devastating house fire.

10:38.350 --> 10:41.582
I was up at 1:30 a.m.,
and I heard a noise at the door.

10:41.583 --> 10:44.516
I open the door to find
two of the walls of our house

10:44.517 --> 10:46.149
completely engulfed in flames.

10:46.150 --> 10:48.549
The fire was actually started
by a heat lamp.

10:48.550 --> 10:50.916
One of the cats knocked it over
in the middle of the night.

10:50.917 --> 10:53.482
We then proceeded
to watch the fire

10:53.483 --> 10:56.016
break through the roof
of our house.

10:56.017 --> 10:58.416
And it was pretty much
a-a total loss.

10:58.417 --> 11:01.749
That was my work.
My home was where I worked.

11:01.750 --> 11:04.116
His music equipment and
everything was just gone.

11:04.117 --> 11:06.416
But our church community
and our friends,

11:06.417 --> 11:09.982
they brought us and replaced all
of his sound equipment and...

11:09.983 --> 11:13.149
I'm very thankful for him
being able to be here.

11:13.150 --> 11:17.116
And that's what's so cool,
because we're all together.

11:17.117 --> 11:18.782
And we realize
that life is precious,

11:18.783 --> 11:22.549
and you need to take advantage
of every single drop of it.

11:22.550 --> 11:25.349
I will be singing "Happiness"

11:25.350 --> 11:26.916
The lyrics go,
"I've got a homesick heart

but a long way left to go."
I miss my home,

11:28.950 --> 11:31.016

you have to keep moving forward.

11:31.017 --> 11:32.782

11:32.783 --> 11:34.382

16:12.917 --> 16:15.049

I did a competition, and I won.

I now live
in Knoxville, Tennessee.

34:56.525 --> 34:58.824

how much they had matured.

35:24.925 --> 35:26.491

for a male voice,

39:30.025 --> 39:32.891
someone who was a little bluesy
and soulful.

39:32.892 --> 39:34.157

40:14.625 --> 40:17.391
While she was in her operation,
she flatlined,

40:17.392 --> 40:19.691
and I begged God
to bring her back, and He did.

40:19.692 --> 40:21.991
And when He did, I said,
"I'm not letting you go again,"

40:21.992 --> 40:22.991
so I proposed.
