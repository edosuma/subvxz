00:12.053 --> 00:13.388
-Hey!
-Hey.

00:14.639 --> 00:16.599
She's been fighting a nap, so...

00:18.935 --> 00:20.270
Oh... the whole way here,

00:20.353 --> 00:22.355
she was like a little baby bobble head.

00:25.942 --> 00:26.860
[Colt] Hey, err...

00:28.028 --> 00:29.946
before we start talking, I just...

00:30.071 --> 00:30.989
[Peyton gurgles]

00:31.448 --> 00:32.699
I want to say I'm sorry

00:32.907 --> 00:34.743
-for showing up at your house drunk.
-[sighs]

00:36.995 --> 00:37.912
Are we okay?

00:39.080 --> 00:40.123
Yeah, we're good.

00:40.999 --> 00:43.835
I'm not gonna put it
in the Christmas newsletter, you know.

00:45.420 --> 00:46.671
"This year, we had a baby,

00:46.755 --> 00:47.839
I got a new job,

00:47.922 --> 00:49.674
Colt got hammered,
tried to punch my dad,

00:49.758 --> 00:51.217
God bless us everyone."

00:53.845 --> 00:55.138
It's better than hearing about

00:55.221 --> 00:57.515
the last toe your Aunt Chris lost
to diabetes.

01:01.102 --> 01:01.936
It's a...

01:03.438 --> 01:05.899
all your stuff for your new apartment.
I packed it up.

01:07.067 --> 01:07.901
Oh, err...

01:08.276 --> 01:09.861
I gave you the good hair dryer.

01:10.236 --> 01:13.073
But I'm gonna need it back
for the Broncos opening day.

01:13.156 --> 01:15.116
That's when I post most on Instagram.

01:17.911 --> 01:20.997
Well, thank you. I know how hard
that must have been for you.

01:21.081 --> 01:23.833
It's the first thing you grabbed
when you thought the house was on fire.

01:23.917 --> 01:24.751
[Colt] Hey!

01:26.711 --> 01:28.004
I came back for you.

01:28.088 --> 01:28.963
Eventually.

01:29.047 --> 01:31.049
[Abby chuckles]

01:31.883 --> 01:34.844
Sure you don't want me
to come over and help unpack?

01:35.011 --> 01:37.013
-No, my dad will be there.
-Oh.

01:37.430 --> 01:40.850
Yeah. That'd be awkward
after me kicking his ass the other night.

01:44.145 --> 01:44.979
Is he okay?

01:46.064 --> 01:48.233
Oh, I don't know.
His shirt was pretty messed up

01:48.316 --> 01:50.193
after all your tears got on it.

01:52.153 --> 01:53.029
I didn't cry.

01:53.530 --> 01:55.240
His tears must've got on my face.

01:59.119 --> 02:01.121
[dog barking in distance]

02:05.333 --> 02:06.292
Hi, Peapod.

02:07.127 --> 02:09.045
You're gonna stay with mom a while.

02:11.381 --> 02:14.342
Just 'cause I ain't with you,
don't mean I ain't thinking about ya.

02:14.425 --> 02:15.802
-[Peyton gurgles]
-Actually, I...

02:18.638 --> 02:19.597
I got you this.

02:21.266 --> 02:22.809
So you don't forget about me.

02:26.354 --> 02:27.188
Love you, kid.

02:29.858 --> 02:30.733
[softly] Alright.

02:33.319 --> 02:34.737
Alright. [sighs]

02:36.239 --> 02:40.326
Looks like you... got everything you need
to move into your new place.

02:40.410 --> 02:42.412
Except... you know, your husband.

02:43.413 --> 02:44.247
Come on.

02:44.914 --> 02:46.624
What? No, I really am just joking.

02:47.542 --> 02:50.962
If I don't, I'll start crying,
and my face will get all red and blotchy,

02:51.045 --> 02:54.299
and I ain't got no idea what box
I put your tinted moisturizer in.

02:56.176 --> 02:57.343
Give me my moisturizer.

02:58.720 --> 02:59.679
[chuckles] Come on.

03:00.054 --> 03:01.097
-What?
-Come on.

03:01.389 --> 03:02.307
Goddammit!

03:07.729 --> 03:08.813
I'd better get going.

03:09.063 --> 03:10.190
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

03:12.358 --> 03:14.027
Let's not make this any sadder than it is.

03:14.110 --> 03:15.403
Get the fuck outta here.

03:17.405 --> 03:18.656
I'll text when we get there.

[car engine starts]

03:35.590 --> 03:37.008

03:38.051 --> 03:39.427
Mary's in the hospital.

03:39.636 --> 03:40.970
Luke's in jail.

03:42.597 --> 03:44.224
-Wow!
-Apparently she overdosed.

03:44.307 --> 03:46.434
We're pickin' up Heather
and heading to Vegas right now.

03:49.437 --> 03:50.271
[Beau] You coming?

03:51.272 --> 03:52.106
Fuck that.

03:53.024 --> 03:55.276
He bailed on me.
She's a fucking train wreck.

[button clicking]

06:01.235 --> 06:02.070
Okay. I think so.

06:02.987 --> 06:06.240
Mom, can you at least stay in the
wheelchair till we're off the property?

06:06.324 --> 06:08.284
The doctors didn't even want you
to leave yet.

06:08.368 --> 06:11.621
Yeah. They also wanted my real name
but I'm not paying those fucking bills.

06:12.955 --> 06:15.166
You know,
you really should stay a little longer.

06:15.666 --> 06:17.335
I heard in Vegas hospitals,

06:17.418 --> 06:19.545
you can bet on
which patient is gonna die first.

06:21.798 --> 06:23.925
-Oh! Thank God!
-[Mary] Hey.

06:24.217 --> 06:25.802
Oh! Boy, that scared me.

06:26.135 --> 06:27.345
There's nothing more disturbing

06:27.428 --> 06:29.222
than paramedics
coming to your Vegas hotel room

06:29.305 --> 06:30.723
and not taking their clothes off.

06:32.975 --> 06:34.685
Oh, you must be Heather. I'm Luke.

06:35.144 --> 06:37.939
Hi. Are you my mom's boyfriend or...
her drug dealer?

06:38.272 --> 06:40.900
Are you her daughter
or Don fucking Rickles?

06:43.027 --> 06:44.779
You sure you're alright, Mary?

06:44.862 --> 06:47.323
I just partied a little too hard,
you know.

06:47.448 --> 06:50.284
Honestly,
I haven't slept like that in years.

06:51.536 --> 06:53.955
You weren't sleeping. You were in a coma.

06:55.039 --> 06:57.458
-Can we just get outta here?
-Yeah, we should really get going.

06:57.542 --> 06:58.501
Err...

06:59.043 --> 07:02.422
I heard on the radio someone stole
Liberace's cape from the museum.

07:02.505 --> 07:05.258
I gotta bad feeling
we had something to do with that, so...

07:05.466 --> 07:06.551
Wait, I'm sorry.

07:07.427 --> 07:09.470
Is this just, like, one big joke to you?

07:09.887 --> 07:12.390
Hey, I'm just trying to put a smile
on her face.

07:12.557 --> 07:14.475
We don't really need you to do that.

07:14.559 --> 07:16.561
In fact,
we don't even need you to be here.

07:16.978 --> 07:19.147
Okay. We're all just here
'cause we love Mary.

07:19.230 --> 07:22.108
Let's hit the road
before Beau sees the Eiffel Tower.

07:24.402 --> 07:25.278
I saw it.

07:25.486 --> 07:27.488
All it's missing is a white flag.

07:32.785 --> 07:33.661
Hey!

07:35.997 --> 07:37.957
Whatever you gotta say,
I don't wanna hear it.

07:38.916 --> 07:41.669
All right. I'll tell Peyton Manning
you don't wanna talk to him.

07:44.380 --> 07:45.381
Sorry, Peyton.

07:45.465 --> 07:48.718
Yeah, just hop back in
that free beer truck and get outta here.

07:52.930 --> 07:53.764
You done?

07:55.057 --> 07:55.892
Listen,

07:56.184 --> 07:57.059
I'm sorry.

07:57.435 --> 07:58.436
Okay? I fucked up.

07:59.520 --> 08:01.355
How can I make it up to you?

08:02.899 --> 08:04.609
I told you Mary was bad news.

08:05.651 --> 08:06.903
You didn't wanna listen.

08:07.153 --> 08:08.321
You had your choice:

08:08.696 --> 08:10.156
family or the dumpster fire,

08:10.239 --> 08:12.366
and you dove dick first into the dumpster.

08:16.245 --> 08:17.997
I'm not here to talk about Mary.

08:18.080 --> 08:20.249
I'm here to talk about
partnering up again.

08:20.416 --> 08:22.543
Well, I ain't interested. I'm doing fine.

08:23.628 --> 08:25.004
Yeah, looks like it.

08:25.630 --> 08:27.340
Who is it that lives in a tent?

08:27.423 --> 08:29.592
Is it Bill Gates or Elon Musk?

08:31.177 --> 08:33.054
Not that it's any of your business,

08:33.137 --> 08:34.305
but I'm making money.

08:35.223 --> 08:38.643
I'm taking a couple of cattle to auction,
make it through the winter.

08:38.809 --> 08:40.853
Look, I don't know a ton about ranching,

08:40.937 --> 08:42.688
but if you keep selling cows,

08:42.772 --> 08:45.775
at what point does this go
from a ranch to just a giant lawn?

08:47.485 --> 08:50.404
I mean, I guess we could have some
sweet wiffle ball games.

08:52.198 --> 08:53.324
Would it be sweet...

08:53.533 --> 08:54.992
or would I just dominate?

08:57.995 --> 08:59.664
You don't know shit about ranching,

08:59.747 --> 09:01.624
so why not stick to what you're good at?

09:01.874 --> 09:05.253
Running off with drug addicts,
wearing overalls with no underwears.

09:07.922 --> 09:09.131
I hate to break this to you

09:09.215 --> 09:11.592
but nobody wears underwears with overalls.

09:12.760 --> 09:14.595
It's the redneck kilt.

09:14.762 --> 09:17.598
Yeah. Well, it's fucking weird, man!

09:19.392 --> 09:20.560
When you walk too fast,

09:20.643 --> 09:23.479
it sounds like two pieces
of baloney slapping together.

09:26.148 --> 09:28.192
This is fun! Don't you miss this?

09:28.276 --> 09:30.069
-I mean, we had a good thing.
-Yeah.

09:30.152 --> 09:31.445
We did have a good thing.

09:32.154 --> 09:33.239
You gave me hope...

09:34.073 --> 09:36.492
that I'd make it through the winter,
then you bailed on me.

09:37.660 --> 09:39.704
So, I'd rather depend on myself than...

09:40.496 --> 09:42.123
a partner I can't fucking trust.

09:43.040 --> 09:43.874
You know,

09:44.542 --> 09:47.795
I'm surprised you can even see me
from way up on that high horse.

09:48.379 --> 09:52.049
Buddy, you bailed on your dad
and your brother over and over again.

09:52.133 --> 09:54.594
Boy, that really makes me wanna be
your partner.

09:54.677 --> 09:55.803
Fuck. You.

09:57.805 --> 09:59.640
-Okay.
-Just get the hell outta here.

10:00.141 --> 10:00.975
Good luck.

10:07.106 --> 10:07.940
Okay.

10:08.149 --> 10:08.983
Bye-bye.

10:11.360 --> 10:13.112
Heather says Mary's doin' okay.

10:13.237 --> 10:14.739
That's great to hear.

10:18.200 --> 10:20.202
Ugh. Creamy peanut butter.

10:22.121 --> 10:23.456
Don't we have any crunchy?

10:35.593 --> 10:36.761
-Hey, Luke.
-Hey.

10:37.261 --> 10:38.262
I just... uh...

10:39.388 --> 10:41.390
wanted to pay you back the bail money.

10:41.682 --> 10:44.977
I also threw in a couple of free passes
to the Liberace Museum.

10:47.021 --> 10:49.065
If you don't wanna make the drive,
I got his...

10:49.357 --> 10:50.399
cape in my truck.

10:54.654 --> 10:55.488
Hey.

10:56.906 --> 10:58.074
I know I screwed up.

10:59.408 --> 11:00.951
And I know that this is a...

11:01.327 --> 11:02.203
wake-up call.

11:03.371 --> 11:04.955
I called the guy at the VA hospital,

11:05.039 --> 11:07.583
he's gonna get me into therapy
as soon as possible.

11:07.667 --> 11:08.668
That's great!

11:08.876 --> 11:10.419
I'll believe it when I see it.

11:11.420 --> 11:12.588
You're gonna see it.

11:13.214 --> 11:14.715
I came here to meet my family,

11:14.799 --> 11:16.926
learn about my dad,
and I still wanna do that.

11:17.176 --> 11:19.178
I'll tell you one thing about your dad.

11:19.970 --> 11:22.431
He'd be even more disappointed in you
than I am.

11:26.519 --> 11:27.353
Alright, well...

11:27.937 --> 11:29.271
thanks for bailing me out.

11:29.730 --> 11:30.564
Joanne.

11:33.234 --> 11:34.235
[door shuts]

11:34.443 --> 11:36.404
[clearing throat] Well, that was harsh.

11:36.654 --> 11:38.280
He came to apologize.

11:38.364 --> 11:40.241
Oh, I guess that makes it alright.

11:41.117 --> 11:43.786
And if Clinton had apologized
for ruining the country,

11:43.869 --> 11:45.830
I'd be a goddamn Democrat.

11:49.208 --> 11:52.169
I can see you're gonna be rational
about this.

11:53.546 --> 11:56.048
When Dale makes a mistake,
you just laugh about it.

11:56.132 --> 11:58.300
But then when... Colt does,

11:58.634 --> 12:00.344
you banish him from the ranch.

12:00.636 --> 12:03.806
And Mary was just
as irresponsible as Luke.

12:03.889 --> 12:05.433
But you called to check on her.

12:05.516 --> 12:07.351
You gave her the landline number.

12:07.435 --> 12:08.686
I don't even have that.

12:11.230 --> 12:14.817
So I hold my family to a higher standard.
What's wrong with that?

12:14.900 --> 12:17.737
We could ask them,
but none of them come around anymore.

12:25.161 --> 12:26.537
-Hey!
-Hey.

12:29.749 --> 12:30.624
How was Vegas?

12:31.500 --> 12:32.626
Do anything fun?

12:32.710 --> 12:34.462
Go see Britney, bitch?

12:35.755 --> 12:37.506
No, I didn't have any fun...

12:38.215 --> 12:39.049
bitch.

12:42.386 --> 12:44.555
You think I was too hard
on you and Rooster?

12:44.638 --> 12:45.598
[splutters]

12:46.140 --> 12:47.349
[chuckling] Oh, shit!

12:47.767 --> 12:49.852
-[chuckling]
-[car engine getting louder]

12:49.935 --> 12:51.937
You just made whiskey come out my nose.

12:54.523 --> 12:56.692
Obviously, I wasn't tough enough.

13:01.238 --> 13:02.490
-Hi, Ab.
-[Abby] Hey.

13:03.991 --> 13:06.243
-[Colt] Hi, sweetie.
-[Abby chuckles]

13:06.494 --> 13:09.121
-[Colt, high voice] Come here, cutie.
-[Abby] Yeah!

13:09.413 --> 13:11.665
Ah, yeah. Aren't  you just...

13:11.999 --> 13:12.917
Oh, God!

13:13.459 --> 13:14.293
Oh!

13:14.752 --> 13:17.505
Why are them parents always smiling
in them Huggies ads?

13:18.756 --> 13:19.715
I'll change her.

13:20.257 --> 13:21.175
[Colt] Okay.

13:22.843 --> 13:25.679
Perhaps it's just a little stall
that needs to be mucked.

13:28.182 --> 13:29.725
[Peyton gurgles]

13:30.059 --> 13:31.602
[sighs] Alright.

13:33.437 --> 13:34.897
Hey, I got a favor to ask.

13:35.231 --> 13:36.315
Oh, don't worry.

13:36.398 --> 13:38.901
I won't let my dad dry Peyton
with the leaf blower.

13:41.070 --> 13:42.571
I didn't realize that was a favor.

13:42.655 --> 13:43.739
Oh.

13:43.906 --> 13:45.366
I just found out there's...

13:46.242 --> 13:47.493
this thing for school,

13:47.576 --> 13:49.829
-so...
-Not another one of those book fairs.

13:50.037 --> 13:51.747
You know, you guys can't call it that.

13:52.206 --> 13:53.749
"Hey, kids, let's go to the fair.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.626
There's no cotton candy or roller coaster

13:55.709 --> 13:57.795
but we got... books."

13:59.338 --> 14:01.882
Okay. No, it's a mixer.

14:01.966 --> 14:04.218
They want the new teachers
to meet everyone.

14:05.052 --> 14:06.262
It's Friday at Maggie's.

14:06.345 --> 14:08.806
And by the way, book fairs are fun.

14:08.889 --> 14:11.475
Okay? You don't need cotton candy
or roller coasters

14:11.559 --> 14:14.311
when you have a ticket
to the greatest ride of all:

14:14.728 --> 14:15.938
your imagination.

14:18.023 --> 14:20.985
[snorts] How did I never
stuff you in a locker in high school?

14:21.151 --> 14:21.986
[Abby chuckles]

14:22.069 --> 14:23.529
You did. That's how we met.

14:25.823 --> 14:28.576
I was hoping
that you would come with me.

14:29.827 --> 14:31.245
-Come with you, huh?
-Yeah.

14:32.037 --> 14:33.497
Oh, all right.

14:33.831 --> 14:36.417
Yesterday, you asked me for space, but...

14:36.500 --> 14:38.669
today you want me to go on a date
with you.

14:40.212 --> 14:41.213
Not a date.

14:41.630 --> 14:43.465
It's just... if I go alone,

14:43.674 --> 14:45.843
people will ask questions,
they're gonna talk, so...

14:46.218 --> 14:47.553
Like, right now, it's...

14:47.636 --> 14:51.140
[gasps] "There's that new teacher.
Can you believe she just had a baby?

14:51.223 --> 14:52.308
She looks so good.

14:52.391 --> 14:55.060
I don't like the term,
but she looks like a MILF."

14:56.896 --> 14:58.647
And if you don't go, it'll be like,

14:58.731 --> 15:01.567
"There's the new teacher.
Can you believe she just got separated?

15:01.650 --> 15:03.777
When she dies,
her cats are gonna eat her."

15:05.279 --> 15:06.113
Hmm.

15:08.949 --> 15:10.367
Oh... I get it.

15:12.328 --> 15:14.413
You don't actually wanna hang out
with me.

15:14.496 --> 15:17.333
You're just...
worried what other people are gonna think.

15:18.876 --> 15:20.085
I'm gonna go ahead and pass.

15:20.419 --> 15:22.838
Okay. Colt! Come on, it's not a big deal.

15:23.213 --> 15:24.590
It's not a big deal?

15:25.424 --> 15:27.968
Yesterday, you made me help you
pack your van,

15:28.052 --> 15:29.595
so you could move to your own apartment.

15:30.179 --> 15:31.931
But today, you want me to pretend

15:32.139 --> 15:34.058
like we're some kinda happy couple,

15:34.141 --> 15:35.851
so you don't feel weird at a party?

15:35.935 --> 15:38.771
It's not a party, it's my job.
Remember the one I had to take

15:38.938 --> 15:41.315
because you lied to me
about selling the herd.

15:41.398 --> 15:44.735
Okay. All you do is tell me
what a shitty husband I am,

15:44.818 --> 15:47.905
now you're asking me for help.
What the fuck you expect I'm gonna say?

15:47.988 --> 15:49.573
It was just a favor. Okay?

15:49.782 --> 15:50.991
Just calm down.

15:51.075 --> 15:52.701
Okay. All you have to say is no.

15:53.327 --> 15:54.954
Why don't you guess what my answer is?

16:05.214 --> 16:06.048
Hey.

16:06.924 --> 16:09.343
I'm headed to the store.
Can I grab you anything?

16:09.551 --> 16:12.680
Yeah. Bananas, Raisin Bran and OxyContin.

16:15.641 --> 16:17.226
What? It's a joke.

16:17.893 --> 16:18.852
Jesus!

16:19.144 --> 16:21.355
I don't eat fucking Raisin Bran.

16:22.690 --> 16:23.732
[knocking on door]

16:25.567 --> 16:27.027
-Hello!
-Hey!

16:27.236 --> 16:29.655
Oh good! Your fourth husband's here.

16:29.905 --> 16:32.408
No! Third husband. Fourth marriage.

16:33.659 --> 16:34.493
Four?

16:34.910 --> 16:37.287
Wow, we would totally suck
at The Newlywed Game.

16:38.664 --> 16:40.499
[sighs] I'm going to the store.

16:40.582 --> 16:42.418
The number for Poison Control
is on the fridge.

16:44.920 --> 16:46.005
Hey, I know it's weird,

16:46.088 --> 16:48.841
but... now that I said it,
I kinda do want Raisin Bran.

16:52.344 --> 16:54.179
How you doin'? You feeling better?

16:54.722 --> 16:55.889
Yeah, I'm alright.

16:56.473 --> 16:57.975
My daughter doesn't trust me.

16:58.934 --> 17:00.436
I raised her, you know.

17:00.519 --> 17:03.147
I'm not perfect,
but I was a pretty responsible parent.

17:03.731 --> 17:07.109
One summer, when they were little,
I thought I lost them at the mall

17:07.192 --> 17:10.112
but it turned out they were safely locked
inside the car.

17:13.282 --> 17:14.783
I think she's just concerned.

17:15.659 --> 17:16.702
I mean, we're all...

17:17.453 --> 17:18.454
a little concerned.

17:20.914 --> 17:22.166
I thought you were dead.

17:23.625 --> 17:24.460
And I can't...

17:25.335 --> 17:27.004
get that image outta my mind.

17:30.549 --> 17:31.508
No, I know.

17:32.968 --> 17:34.636
I've been acting stupid.

17:37.264 --> 17:38.515
I got back here and...

17:39.725 --> 17:43.270
I gave my grand kids a hug and a kiss,
and I just thought, "Shit!

17:45.022 --> 17:46.356
What if I hadn't made it?"

17:46.940 --> 17:47.775
You know?

17:48.317 --> 17:50.444
How could they even explain that to them?

17:52.821 --> 17:54.615
I gotta get my shit together, Luke.

17:56.825 --> 17:58.160
Hey, we both do.

17:59.495 --> 18:01.080
We'll do it together, it'll be easier.

18:02.331 --> 18:04.458
And I'm excited I just found out
I'm a grandfather.

18:04.541 --> 18:06.043
-[Mary laughs]
-Know what that solves?

18:06.126 --> 18:09.421
From now on, I don't have to say
I'm unemployed, I can say I'm retired.

18:11.799 --> 18:12.758
What are their names?

18:14.551 --> 18:15.969
Kira and... Luke.

18:16.470 --> 18:17.763
They named one after his papa.

18:17.846 --> 18:19.640
-[May laughs]
-That's great.

18:21.308 --> 18:22.142
Err...

18:22.601 --> 18:24.311
Listen, Papa.
[sniffs]

18:24.478 --> 18:27.898
We should probably talk
about the fact that we're married. Huh?

18:28.690 --> 18:30.818
Okay.
I think I know what you're gonna say.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.529
Yeah? So, you're cool
with getting a divorce?

18:34.822 --> 18:37.241
I thought you were gonna say,
"Let's have a nice reception,

18:37.324 --> 18:39.576
really do it right, rent out a Shakey's."

18:39.660 --> 18:41.870
[chuckles]
Well, I'm sorry to blindside you.

18:42.454 --> 18:44.706
Especially on our two-day anniversary.

18:46.583 --> 18:47.793
I really like you.

18:48.418 --> 18:51.839
I mean, I know we rushed into it,
but I wanna keep hanging out.

18:52.548 --> 18:53.382
Me too.

18:53.799 --> 18:54.883
I mean, you're cool.

18:55.175 --> 18:57.094
You're fun. You're beautiful.

18:58.137 --> 19:01.515
Even when the paramedics
were pumping your stomach, I thought...

19:01.598 --> 19:02.766
"I'd still hit that."

19:02.850 --> 19:04.351
-[laughing] Jesus!
-I would.

19:07.646 --> 19:08.772
[shouting in distance]

19:08.939 --> 19:09.773
Yeah!

19:09.898 --> 19:12.025
[loudly] Yeah, next up
is Bennett Brothers Ranch.

19:12.109 --> 19:15.487
No. I'd pay double, maybe triple
market value for their cows.

19:17.698 --> 19:21.743
Huh? Yeah! The owner does look like
a hotter, more-in-shape Ryan Gosling.

19:23.203 --> 19:24.621
-Hey, Colt.
-Hiya, Rich.

19:24.705 --> 19:28.250
I got the guy from Neumann's Hill here.
I gotta call you back... Mr...

19:28.792 --> 19:29.626
Sizzler.

19:31.295 --> 19:32.921
Selling some cattle, huh?

19:33.255 --> 19:35.841
Yep. A lot of interest.

19:36.425 --> 19:38.886
I thought I'd capitalize
on the opportunity.

19:39.511 --> 19:40.804
Supply and demand.

19:41.471 --> 19:43.849
Free agency. Bossing the market.

19:45.517 --> 19:46.351
Come on, man.

19:46.685 --> 19:49.104
The only people selling cows here today
are people who have to.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.690
And the only people buying them
work for big outfits like mine.

19:53.108 --> 19:54.234
What's your point, Rich?

19:54.526 --> 19:55.694
I've seen this before.

19:56.153 --> 19:59.907
Guys like you, selling off a piece here,
a piece there, all end up the same.

20:00.115 --> 20:02.826
Look. I know Lisa is lowballing you
on the ranch.

20:02.910 --> 20:05.787
Maybe I can talk to her, so you at least
walk away with something.

20:05.871 --> 20:07.706
There you go.
That's what you're doing here.

20:07.831 --> 20:08.707
Lisa sent you?

20:09.208 --> 20:11.335
Nobody sent me, man.
I'm just trying to help.

20:11.752 --> 20:12.586
I don't need help.

20:14.213 --> 20:17.216
Bennetts have been ranching since
long before Neumann's Hill ever existed.

20:17.716 --> 20:19.509
And we'll be here long after you're gone.

20:20.135 --> 20:20.969
Alright.

20:21.929 --> 20:23.931
You go broke, waiting on a miracle.

20:24.014 --> 20:25.974
[auctioneer over PA]
A fine Bennett Bros' heifer...

20:26.183 --> 20:28.143
Hey, maybe I'll buy some of your cows.

20:28.352 --> 20:30.062
Unless, you know, I'm outbid by...

20:30.145 --> 20:31.772
you know, Mr. Sizzler.

20:36.902 --> 20:37.819
Forty-one hundred.

20:37.945 --> 20:40.489
[auctioneer] Forty-one, here we go.
Do I hear 42?

20:40.572 --> 20:42.491
Forty-two. Come on now, 43.
Can I have 44?

20:42.574 --> 20:45.744
Come on now, 45?
Do I have 45? I got 45.

20:45.827 --> 20:47.621
Now, go 46. Come on now, 46...

20:47.704 --> 20:48.914
What are you doing here?

20:49.206 --> 20:50.374
Saving your ass.

20:50.457 --> 20:53.001
I got this. I don't need anybody's help.

20:53.377 --> 20:54.503
Oh, I believe ya.

20:55.337 --> 20:57.631
Heard you talkin'
with some real heavy hitters over there.

20:57.798 --> 20:59.091
Mr. Sizzler.

20:59.216 --> 21:00.217
Mr. Outback.

21:00.842 --> 21:03.553
I even heard you on the phone
with Melinda Applebee's.

21:05.597 --> 21:06.765
Look, you won't take my money,

21:06.848 --> 21:08.976
so I'm gonna use my money
to buy your cows.

21:09.351 --> 21:11.395
What the hell you gonna do
with a bunch of cows?

21:11.603 --> 21:13.939
Give them back to you,
so we can be partners again.

21:14.731 --> 21:16.441
Or maybe I'll line them up
like dominoes,

21:16.525 --> 21:18.068
tip the first one and see what happens.

21:18.151 --> 21:20.570
I'll tell you what happens.
Your dad yells at you.

21:22.030 --> 21:23.907
I already told you,
we ain't gonna be partners.

21:23.991 --> 21:24.992
Hmm. We'll see.

21:25.951 --> 21:28.453
You know what?
Fine, go ahead and keep bidding.

21:28.537 --> 21:30.789
All you're doing is raising the price
on my cattle.

21:31.415 --> 21:33.709
Well, I'm not gonna get outbid.
This is America, buddy.

21:33.792 --> 21:36.586
I got no problem spending too much
on something I don't need.

21:38.880 --> 21:41.842
Even if you do buy the cows,
we ain't gonna be partners.

21:42.175 --> 21:45.554
This is gonna make you an idiot
with a bunch of cows you don't need.

21:46.930 --> 21:48.432
Well, it's not about the cows.

21:49.349 --> 21:51.601
Look, I've been home from Iraq
for ten years.

21:51.852 --> 21:54.646
Bouncing back and forth
from shitty job to shitty job.

21:54.855 --> 21:55.897
Lost my wife.

21:56.398 --> 21:57.482
Lost my mom.

21:58.108 --> 21:59.484
Come here and meet you and Beau.

22:00.319 --> 22:03.155
I feel like maybe there's somewhere
I belong, so...

22:03.238 --> 22:04.323
I'm not giving that up.

22:04.406 --> 22:06.950
Okay. What? So now I'm a dick
if I don't say yes.

22:08.201 --> 22:09.536
That's what I was going for.

22:10.996 --> 22:12.789
Look, I broke your trust.

22:12.873 --> 22:15.292
So I'm gonna keep showing up
until I earn it back.

22:15.667 --> 22:17.210
[auctioneer] Fifty-seven now...

22:17.586 --> 22:18.503
What about Mary?

22:18.920 --> 22:20.672
Mary's got nothing to do with this.

22:20.839 --> 22:23.759
Bottom line is, I'm never
gonna bail on you ever again.

22:25.510 --> 22:28.305
[auctioneer] Fifty-nine hundred!
Hoo yeah! Going once...

22:28.513 --> 22:30.891
I'd rather you buy me than Neumann's Hill.
Fucking bid.

22:31.433 --> 22:33.685
[auctioneer] Six thousand going once,
going twice...

22:34.227 --> 22:37.230
and sold for six thousand to paddle 342.

22:37.314 --> 22:38.899
-There we go.
-[hoots]

22:39.066 --> 22:40.275
That feels good!

22:40.650 --> 22:42.944
Now I know why rich people
buy paintings this way.

22:43.904 --> 22:44.780
Alright.

22:46.823 --> 22:48.658
-Now we go get our cows...
-[auctioneer] Hoo-ey!

22:48.742 --> 22:49.576
...partner.

22:50.369 --> 22:51.203
Alright!

22:52.329 --> 22:53.997
Now I'm officially a rancher.

22:54.706 --> 22:56.249
Feel like it's in my blood.

22:57.084 --> 23:00.545
Goddamn! That manure smell's
gonna make me puke. Let's get outta here.

23:01.088 --> 23:03.090
[country music playing from radio]

23:05.717 --> 23:07.177
-Hey!
-Hey.

23:08.553 --> 23:10.222
I was surprised to see you text me.

23:11.014 --> 23:13.100
Also surprised you know how to text.

23:15.394 --> 23:18.772
Not surprised you ended the text
with the word "send" four times.

23:20.399 --> 23:22.150
What's up with Joanne's truck?

23:22.234 --> 23:24.403
The damn engine keeps stalling.

23:26.154 --> 23:27.739
Well I think I see the problem.

23:27.823 --> 23:28.740
What's that?

23:29.199 --> 23:30.033
It's a Chevy.

23:32.619 --> 23:35.247
Yeah, no shit.
Time of death: assembly line.

23:35.330 --> 23:36.540
[Luke laughs]

23:38.792 --> 23:40.043
Hey, also, I...

23:40.836 --> 23:44.631
I'm really sorry you hiked all the way
out there to Vegas for us.

23:44.714 --> 23:45.549
It's alright.

23:46.466 --> 23:48.427
Having Colt and Rooster as kids,

23:48.844 --> 23:51.763
a lot of my road trips
involved going to a jail.

23:53.432 --> 23:56.059
Colt got arrested
at the Grand Canyon one time.

23:56.810 --> 23:58.728
-That was pretty nice.
-[chuckles]

23:59.896 --> 24:01.064
Wanna throw me that ratchet?

24:01.523 --> 24:02.357
Sure.

24:02.983 --> 24:04.109
[Luke] See what we got.

24:06.278 --> 24:07.154
[Beau] You know,

24:07.237 --> 24:11.241
standing here with you takes me right back
to working on cars with your father.

24:11.575 --> 24:14.119
Yeah, was he good at fixing engines, too?

24:14.202 --> 24:15.412
And breaking them.

24:17.831 --> 24:20.167
When we were kids,
we hated going to church,

24:20.917 --> 24:22.627
especially during football season.

24:23.420 --> 24:25.672
So, Greg would get up before anybody else,

24:25.755 --> 24:30.093
come out here and unplug the spark plug
or loosen the battery cable.

24:30.427 --> 24:32.262
[chuckles] That's good.

24:32.471 --> 24:36.099
I just used to say Father Thompson was
getting handsy with me.

24:39.644 --> 24:41.396
Sorry, you were telling a story.

24:41.480 --> 24:42.314
Yeah.

24:43.356 --> 24:45.358
Anyway, we'd miss church.

24:46.193 --> 24:48.820
And then Greg would pretend
to fix the truck

24:48.904 --> 24:51.406
while we listened to the Broncos game
on the radio.

24:51.531 --> 24:54.201
And after it was over,
he'd stick the wire back in

24:54.284 --> 24:56.661
and say, "Hey, I fixed the truck.

24:56.786 --> 24:59.039
How about taking us
to get some ice cream?"

24:59.122 --> 25:00.332
[Luke chuckles]

25:01.249 --> 25:04.127
I'm pretty sure your grandfather knew
what was going on.

25:05.045 --> 25:06.171
He went along with it,

25:07.047 --> 25:10.175
because he liked football and ice cream
more than he liked God.

25:14.596 --> 25:16.598
I like hearing those stories about him.

25:17.057 --> 25:18.767
It gives me a sense of who he was.

25:19.935 --> 25:20.769
I appreciate it.

25:20.852 --> 25:21.686
Yeah.

25:23.355 --> 25:24.773
I got something for you.

25:31.947 --> 25:33.198
[birds squawking]

25:36.409 --> 25:37.410
[Luke] Oh wow!

25:40.664 --> 25:43.375
I should've given it to you
when you first got here.

25:45.252 --> 25:48.505
For years, that's felt like
the last connection that I had to him.

25:50.924 --> 25:52.092
I can't take this.

25:52.509 --> 25:54.219
Not my last connection anymore.

25:55.053 --> 25:55.887
You are.

25:56.930 --> 25:58.765
Sorry I almost fucked that up by...

26:00.141 --> 26:01.226
driving you away.

26:02.644 --> 26:04.104
I'm glad you're here, Luke.

26:05.730 --> 26:06.565
Thanks, Beau.

26:09.025 --> 26:10.735
Any chance my dad was a hugger?

26:11.278 --> 26:13.113
Nah, he hated 'em, just like me.

26:14.114 --> 26:15.699
[chuckles] Okay, fair enough.

26:18.326 --> 26:19.160
Come here.

26:21.204 --> 26:22.372
[back slaps]

26:25.417 --> 26:26.418

26:27.586 --> 26:29.170

[door knocks]

26:42.058 --> 26:43.435
[Luke] Papa's home!

26:44.019 --> 26:45.520
Hey, what are you doing here?

26:45.604 --> 26:47.606
I thought we could celebrate our divorce

26:47.689 --> 26:49.482
with a romantic dinner for deux.

26:49.566 --> 26:50.400
Mm.

26:50.483 --> 26:52.110
Played a little dollar-menu roulette,

26:52.193 --> 26:54.279
gave the guy five bucks
and said, "Surprise me."

26:54.362 --> 26:55.238
Could be anything.

26:55.322 --> 26:57.866
A few Big Macs... Quarter Pounder...

27:08.960 --> 27:10.170
Babe, can we do this later?

27:10.253 --> 27:11.504
I'm a little tired.

27:11.963 --> 27:13.214
Yeah. Sure.

27:13.923 --> 27:16.009
Ooh. Patched things up with Colt.

27:17.218 --> 27:18.887
Bought some cows.
Hope you like steak.

-I'm kidding. We don't kill 'em yet.

Actually, I don't know.

Huh?

27:31.358 --> 27:34.736
Oh... I know! Fucking Stan, right? God...

27:35.654 --> 27:37.280
I asked if I could call you later.

Oh sorry. Yeah, that's good.

Don't bullshit me.

27:47.082 --> 27:48.208
Okay. Jesus!

27:48.291 --> 27:50.710
I took an aspirin for a headache, okay?

[scoffs] An aspirin--

27:52.420 --> 27:54.214
I was with you for two weeks in Vegas.

-Didn't try. Did.

I don't like people telling me what to do.

for being upset. All right?

to come to this. I'm sorry.

for me, too.

-No.

try to dance.
