00:43.844 --> 00:45.779
Oh, shit.
Hi.

00:45.846 --> 00:47.115
Hey, how you doing?

00:48.582 --> 00:49.917
Hi, how are you?

00:49.983 --> 00:52.153
How are you,
Delores?

00:52.220 --> 00:53.887
I wanted to talk to
you about something

00:53.954 --> 00:57.158
regarding the time
that you...

00:57.225 --> 00:58.592
came to my apartment.

01:01.862 --> 01:03.030
Hey.

01:03.097 --> 01:04.698
Do you remember?
Yes, I...

01:04.765 --> 01:06.134
Yes, I do.

01:07.635 --> 01:08.836
Oh, Daddy.

01:10.604 --> 01:14.608
Well, I'm having some
residual feelings

01:14.675 --> 01:16.310
about what happened.

01:16.377 --> 01:19.580
Oh, Daddy,
I'm so sorry!

01:19.647 --> 01:20.714
( sobbing )

01:22.816 --> 01:24.952
What kind of residual--

01:25.018 --> 01:26.454
Have you told anyone
about what happened?

01:26.520 --> 01:29.590
No, of course not.
Why not?

01:29.657 --> 01:30.958
What?

01:31.024 --> 01:32.993
I've been
talking about it a lot.

01:33.060 --> 01:35.028
You have?
Yes.

01:35.095 --> 01:37.465
In therapy.
Ah, okay.

01:37.531 --> 01:38.632
I mean, um.

01:38.699 --> 01:41.735
In fact, I wanted to
ask you for a favor.

01:41.802 --> 01:43.937
What's that?

01:44.004 --> 01:46.440
Will you come to
therapy with me?

01:47.708 --> 01:50.010
You want me to come to
your therapist with...

01:50.077 --> 01:51.545
Yeah, I have some things
to say to you

01:51.612 --> 01:53.747
about what happened
and I would feel better

01:53.814 --> 01:56.417
if it was in my
therapist's presence.
Are you upset with me, or--

01:56.484 --> 01:58.719
What...
Are you gonna
do it or not?

02:02.156 --> 02:04.091
I don't think so,
Delores.

02:04.158 --> 02:05.993
I don't think
I'm gonna do that.

02:06.059 --> 02:07.728
I'll--

02:07.795 --> 02:10.097
Well, can I ask for your
help with something else?

02:10.164 --> 02:11.365
What?

02:11.432 --> 02:13.534
This Sunday,
I want to rent a van

02:13.601 --> 02:15.669
and I want to go to the IKEA
in New Jersey.

02:15.736 --> 02:18.439
I need a lot of
stuff for my home right now

02:18.506 --> 02:21.775
and Nelson's father isn't
paying much support.

02:24.578 --> 02:26.680
Okay, so--
Will you come with me?

02:26.747 --> 02:28.816
You want me to go to
IKEA with you?

02:28.882 --> 02:30.384
If you go with me,

02:30.451 --> 02:32.720
I promise to
give you a blow job.

02:32.786 --> 02:34.154
Delores.
What?

02:34.222 --> 02:36.023
You don't-- if you want
something from me,

02:36.089 --> 02:38.359
you could just ask--
I'm not asking for
charity from you.

02:38.426 --> 02:39.560
I don't need your help.

02:39.627 --> 02:40.894
I'm just saying,
if you offer it,

02:40.961 --> 02:42.530
I'll suck your dick.

02:49.470 --> 02:50.838
Hi, Merideth,
how you doing?

02:50.904 --> 02:52.640
It's nice to see you.

03:16.964 --> 03:22.169
I think this rug will
fit in Nelson's room but...

03:22.236 --> 03:24.372
I don't know about
the color.

03:28.776 --> 03:31.945
It would be a lot more help
if you would participate.

03:34.515 --> 03:37.551
How do you want me
to participate?

03:37.618 --> 03:39.420
You know, it really burns me
that you need me to tell you

03:39.487 --> 03:41.389
how to be helpful.

03:41.455 --> 03:44.492
It's harder than doing
everything myself and...

03:44.558 --> 03:47.728
It's insulting, really.

03:50.130 --> 03:52.199
Hey, Delores, if you need
something, just ask for it,

03:52.266 --> 03:54.067
don't make me read
your mind.

03:54.134 --> 03:55.636
Oh, thank you.

03:55.703 --> 03:58.439
Thanks for answering
my request for help

03:58.506 --> 03:59.940
by making fun of me.

04:00.007 --> 04:01.775
I'm not making
fun of you.

04:01.842 --> 04:03.210
What is your problem?

04:03.277 --> 04:04.712
I'm trying-- What--
What's your problem?

04:04.778 --> 04:06.480
I don't have a problem,
I have a lot of stuff

04:06.547 --> 04:07.881
that I have to
accomplish.

04:10.050 --> 04:11.585
Let's not let that
happen to us.

04:13.120 --> 04:14.855
Okay, hossenfeffer.

04:19.860 --> 04:21.094
I'm gonna
pry it out of you--
I'm not--

04:21.161 --> 04:22.062
You're not prying it
out of me.

04:22.129 --> 04:23.931
I'll tell you.

04:23.997 --> 04:25.866
If you wanna know what I think
of the rug, I'll tell you.

04:27.968 --> 04:29.470
It's fine.

04:29.537 --> 04:31.705
"It's fine," that's it?

04:31.772 --> 04:33.641
That's your opinion, that's
all you have to offer?

04:33.707 --> 04:35.709
It's a rug!

04:35.776 --> 04:37.311
It's fine.

04:37.378 --> 04:40.348
That's the level of passion
that a rug warrants.

04:40.414 --> 04:44.117
It's a rug, it doesn't
solve all of my problems.

04:44.184 --> 04:47.087
But it doesn't make
me angry.

04:47.154 --> 04:48.956
It's a rug--
it doesn't smell bad,

04:49.022 --> 04:52.225
it's flat, it's blue,
it goes on the floor.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.562
It's not coated with AIDS

04:54.628 --> 04:57.798
and it's not a portal
to a nether place.

04:57.865 --> 05:01.001
It's-- it's-- it doesn't
make me come, but it's fine.

05:06.006 --> 05:08.041
Ah, Delores.

05:08.108 --> 05:09.209
Jesus.

05:09.276 --> 05:10.978
( crying )
Hey.

05:11.044 --> 05:12.680
All right, I'm sorry.

05:15.182 --> 05:16.950
Okay, all right,
okay.

05:17.017 --> 05:19.252
( sobbing )

05:19.319 --> 05:21.955
Okay, it's all right.

05:22.022 --> 05:24.091
Okay, okay.

05:24.157 --> 05:27.928
( sobbing )

05:30.731 --> 05:31.765
Okay.

05:33.767 --> 05:34.267
All right.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.670
( sighing )

05:42.209 --> 05:44.044
I owe you
a blow job.

05:48.315 --> 05:49.950
You know what,
don't worry about it.

05:51.985 --> 05:53.353
No, I owe it to you.

05:53.421 --> 05:55.823
I prefer to stick to
our arrangement.

05:58.792 --> 06:01.695
Okay, well, you can
just owe it to me, okay?

06:05.766 --> 06:07.334
So...

06:07.401 --> 06:11.071
notify me when you
want me to...

06:11.138 --> 06:12.740
suck it.

06:16.309 --> 06:17.811
Okay.

06:22.249 --> 06:23.851
( sighing )

06:26.787 --> 06:29.089
Maybe I should have
gotten two of those chairs.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.162
You mean
the rattan chairs?
Mm-hmm.

06:35.228 --> 06:37.230
No, no, no.

06:37.297 --> 06:38.799
The painted ones are good,

06:38.866 --> 06:40.100
they're gonna be better
for your space,

06:40.167 --> 06:42.803
they'll be
more practical.

06:42.870 --> 06:44.004
You did good.

06:54.181 --> 06:56.817
( dog barking in distance )

06:56.884 --> 06:58.151
( knocking )

07:02.355 --> 07:03.491
( Louie )
Oh, hi.
( woman )
Hi!

07:03.557 --> 07:05.292
Hi.
Hi!

07:05.358 --> 07:07.227
You must be Doris.
Yes, hi, you're Louie?

07:07.294 --> 07:09.162
That's me.
Hello.

07:09.229 --> 07:11.465
Nice to meet you.
Uh, so, um.

07:11.532 --> 07:12.933
Well...

07:13.000 --> 07:15.302
Can I get you
something to drink?

07:15.368 --> 07:17.304
No, oh, no, I'm fine, I've got
my own water right here.
Okay.

07:17.370 --> 07:21.274
Well, this is my--
this is my piano.
Oh, all right, great.

07:21.341 --> 07:22.776
So should we--
Yeah.

07:22.843 --> 07:24.978
No, no,
can I ask what made you

07:25.045 --> 07:26.880
wanna decide to take
piano lessons?

07:26.947 --> 07:29.049
You told me on the phone
that this is your first time.

07:29.116 --> 07:31.619
Oh, yeah, well, it's kind of
weird 'cause I'm 44, right,

07:31.685 --> 07:33.320
and most people
probably don't start--

07:33.386 --> 07:35.022
No, that's great,
it's great.

07:35.088 --> 07:37.658
Well-- okay, well, I bought
this piano for my kids

07:37.725 --> 07:39.793
so they can learn

07:39.860 --> 07:41.995
and neither of them
wanted to.
Right.

07:42.062 --> 07:43.831
And then I just decided,

07:43.897 --> 07:45.699
you know, screw them,
I'll learn piano.
Great.

07:45.766 --> 07:47.334
I don't know.
Great.

07:47.400 --> 07:48.869
So we're starting
from scratch?

07:48.936 --> 07:50.738
Yeah, from scratch.
Great.

07:50.804 --> 07:52.773
Okay, well.
( playing piano )

07:52.840 --> 07:54.307
the thing to know about
the piano is that--

07:54.374 --> 07:55.576
That was--
that was really nice.

07:55.643 --> 07:57.177
Oh.
That's really good.

07:57.244 --> 07:59.880
Well, you'll-- you'll
play like that soon enough.

07:59.947 --> 08:02.182
But the piano is
actually the...
( cell phone ringing )

08:02.249 --> 08:04.251
the soul and
the heart of--
Oh, I'm sorry.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.253
I'm sorry.

08:06.319 --> 08:09.089
I'll just ignore--
No, no, no, that's okay,
you can get it.

08:09.156 --> 08:11.859
Just one call, okay,
thank you.
Yeah, it's okay.

08:11.925 --> 08:13.293
Hello?

08:13.360 --> 08:14.762
Hi.

08:14.828 --> 08:16.764
So listen, either you
gave me the crabs

08:16.830 --> 08:19.132
or I gave you
the crabs but anyway--

08:19.199 --> 08:20.734
I have the crabs

08:20.801 --> 08:23.537
and you were inside me last
week, so you got crabs too.

08:23.604 --> 08:25.739
Uh. so...

08:27.575 --> 08:29.076
Jesus!

08:29.142 --> 08:31.044
You didn't feel itchy?

08:31.111 --> 08:32.613
Yeah, but I thought it--

08:32.680 --> 08:34.381
I thought it was
laundry detergent.

08:34.447 --> 08:37.217
No, crabs.

08:37.284 --> 08:38.485
Uh...

08:38.552 --> 08:41.622
So... ( blank ) you
or... sorry.

08:41.689 --> 08:43.991
I don't
know which one.

08:44.057 --> 08:45.759
Bye.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.029
Uh.

08:49.096 --> 08:50.631
Are you okay?

08:50.698 --> 08:53.033
Well, I got a little bit
of an emergency and I'm...

08:53.100 --> 08:55.102
It's okay, it's gonna be
okay but it's kind of--
Oh, I'm so sorry.

08:55.168 --> 08:56.970
It's something I just need
to deal with right now,

08:57.037 --> 08:59.740
so I don't think
I can do this right now.
Oh, oh--

08:59.807 --> 09:02.442
I'm really sorry
but I really think I--
It's okay... okay.

09:02.509 --> 09:05.212
I gotta ask you to go
'cause I gotta--
Oh, no, that's all right.

09:05.278 --> 09:07.447
Can we just do this
another time?
Sure, sure, sure, sure,
no problem.

09:07.514 --> 09:09.516
I'll pay you for today,
I don't mean to--
No, no, no, no, no.

09:09.583 --> 09:10.984
That's okay,
that's okay.

09:11.051 --> 09:13.654
I'm really sorry,
Doris, I just, uh...

09:25.833 --> 09:27.735
Ahh!

09:27.801 --> 09:29.637
( motorcycle revving )

09:37.277 --> 09:38.511
Excuse me, uh...

09:38.578 --> 09:39.613
Yes, can I help you?

09:39.680 --> 09:41.348
Yeah, I have, uh,

09:41.414 --> 09:43.083
I-- Crabs.

09:46.519 --> 09:47.855
Can I--
Do you need
the shampoo?

09:47.921 --> 09:49.056
Yes.

09:49.122 --> 09:50.590
I had it when I was younger,
so I remember

09:50.658 --> 09:52.392
but I don't--
Do you have it?

09:52.459 --> 09:55.629
Do you not have it?
Yeah, we keep it
behind the counter.

09:55.696 --> 09:57.297
It's nonprescription
but if we kept it out there,

09:57.364 --> 09:58.198
nobody would ever pay for it.

09:58.265 --> 10:00.433
Ah, okay.

10:00.500 --> 10:02.235
Can I have it, please?
Yes.

10:02.302 --> 10:04.537
Uh, I'm gonna have to
put it together for you.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.039
It's a kit.
Great.

10:06.106 --> 10:08.508
Excuse me.
Yes, can I help you?

10:08.575 --> 10:10.377
I'd like to speak to
the pharmacist.

10:10.443 --> 10:11.845
Um, what about?

10:11.912 --> 10:13.947
Well, I got this
prescription here

10:14.014 --> 10:15.115
but, um...

10:15.182 --> 10:17.550
but I want to
consult with him.

10:17.617 --> 10:18.618
I didn't get my
consultation.

10:18.686 --> 10:20.287
Mm-hmm.

10:20.353 --> 10:21.955
Okay, that's an antibiotic,

10:22.022 --> 10:22.756
so if you just follow
the instructions,

10:22.823 --> 10:25.158
you should be just fine.

10:25.225 --> 10:26.827
Of course.

10:26.894 --> 10:29.462
But I would like to
speak with him.
Well...

10:29.529 --> 10:31.531
I need a consultation.

10:31.598 --> 10:33.400
Yes-- He's busy
at the moment.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.468
Well, when can
I speak to him?

10:35.535 --> 10:38.105
What seems to be
the problem?

10:38.171 --> 10:40.307
Well, I wanna make sure
I'm taking it right.

10:40.373 --> 10:41.709
Are you taking
water with it?

10:41.775 --> 10:43.543
Yes.
And food?

10:43.610 --> 10:45.545
Yes, I've been
taking it with my meals.

10:45.612 --> 10:49.382
And have you been
urinating regularly?

10:49.449 --> 10:51.518
Well, yes, I have.

10:51.584 --> 10:54.087
How many times
did you urinate today?

10:56.089 --> 10:57.958
Well, uh...

10:58.025 --> 11:00.928
Three times, I urinated
three times today.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.796
Did you have
a bowel movement today?

11:02.863 --> 11:04.832
Yes, I did,
I had a bowel movement!

11:07.467 --> 11:10.103
What was it like?

11:10.170 --> 11:12.339
Was it soft?

11:12.405 --> 11:15.642
Was it hard?

11:15.709 --> 11:17.911
Or was your
bowel movement normal?

11:20.613 --> 11:23.350
Well, it was perhaps
a little soft

11:23.416 --> 11:25.418
but it was
mostly normal.

11:27.955 --> 11:30.290
You should be fine.

11:30.357 --> 11:32.325
Thank you.

11:38.431 --> 11:39.532
There you go.

11:39.599 --> 11:41.301
( motorcycle revving )

11:47.540 --> 11:48.708
Ugh.

12:00.187 --> 12:05.392
And the winner of Moneyhouse,
and the 17 $40 prize.

12:05.458 --> 12:08.661
( man )
It's time for
"Retro Comedy Showcase!"

12:08.728 --> 12:11.364
Tonight, the '80s.

12:11.431 --> 12:13.901
First up, Louie CK.

12:19.339 --> 12:20.974
( Louie )
Thank you very much!

12:21.041 --> 12:22.810
My name is Louie.

12:22.876 --> 12:25.212
I have red hair,

12:25.278 --> 12:26.713
which means I can't
go to the beach

12:26.780 --> 12:28.048
because I don't really tan,

12:28.115 --> 12:30.350
I just kind of burst
into flames.

12:32.619 --> 12:34.154
So I live in New York City.

12:34.221 --> 12:36.089
New York is a-- is a--
it's the only city

12:36.156 --> 12:38.025
I've ever been where you
actually have to say things

12:38.091 --> 12:40.293
like, "Hey, that's mine,
don't pee on that."

12:40.360 --> 12:42.029
But, uh...

12:47.000 --> 12:50.203
Thank you very much, you've
been a pleasure, good night!

12:50.270 --> 12:53.941
( man )
Now it's time for
Sarah Silverman!

12:54.007 --> 12:57.110
Hey, how are you doing?

12:57.177 --> 12:58.979
Thank you very much,
it's really nice to be here.

12:59.046 --> 13:01.114
You know, I was just back East
'cause my sister got married,

13:01.181 --> 13:02.950
and it was really neat,

13:03.016 --> 13:04.751
you know, they took each
other's last names.

13:04.818 --> 13:06.653
They hyphenated it, you know?

13:06.719 --> 13:11.358
So now my sister's name is:
Susan Silverman-Abromowitz.

13:11.424 --> 13:13.827
They're thinking of just
shortening it to just:

13:13.894 --> 13:16.629
Jews.

13:16.696 --> 13:18.165
Ha-ha!

13:18.231 --> 13:20.300
... the Jews,
they're good people.

13:23.370 --> 13:25.105
Hey!

13:25.172 --> 13:27.607
Hey, you gotta turn on the
Comedy channel right now.

13:27.674 --> 13:29.276
Oh, no, why?

13:32.179 --> 13:34.314
( Sarah )
...best friend.
Oh, no!

13:34.381 --> 13:37.417
( laughing )

13:37.484 --> 13:39.386
( laughing )

13:39.452 --> 13:41.855
Oh, no.
You look like
my friend Debbie.

13:41.922 --> 13:43.090
Oh, God.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.858
You know what,
I think I look better now.

13:44.925 --> 13:47.060
Yeah, you do,
it's true.

13:47.127 --> 13:48.661
It's sad, though, you know,
'cause we're not really

13:48.728 --> 13:50.430
friends anymore, but.

13:50.497 --> 13:54.101
"I was so cute
and I didn't know better."

13:54.167 --> 13:55.869
It's a lot of those
kind of jokes.

13:55.936 --> 13:57.204
"Did I say something?

13:57.270 --> 13:59.472
I didn't even know
I said something."

13:59.539 --> 14:02.509
Oh, pathological liar.

14:02.575 --> 14:03.944
How are you?

14:04.011 --> 14:06.613
I'm okay,
I had a stupid day.

14:06.679 --> 14:08.048
Why?

14:08.115 --> 14:10.183
( man )
And now, Marc Maron!

14:10.250 --> 14:11.618
Oh, my God,
Marc Maron!

14:11.684 --> 14:15.122
( cheers and applause )

14:15.188 --> 14:15.822
How you doing, folks,
all right?

14:15.889 --> 14:18.125
( audience)
Yeah!

14:18.191 --> 14:20.393
Let's start a revolution,
what do you think?

14:20.460 --> 14:22.029
That never happens
in this country.

14:22.095 --> 14:23.763
All I know is, last year,

14:23.830 --> 14:25.565
a million students rebelled
in China;

14:25.632 --> 14:28.001
650,000 people in Romania;

14:28.068 --> 14:28.936
a half a million
in East Germany--

14:29.002 --> 14:30.670
I'm thinking to myself,

14:30.737 --> 14:33.006
you couldn't get a half-million
Americans together

14:33.073 --> 14:34.942
unless it was a really
good rock-'n'-roll show...

14:35.008 --> 14:37.945
Look at him,
he looks adorable.

14:38.011 --> 14:39.879
... giving away beer.

14:39.947 --> 14:42.249
I mean, if I came up to you
and I said, "Come!

14:42.315 --> 14:45.018
"We must go to
the center of town

14:45.085 --> 14:48.721
fight for freedom,
democracy and our rights!"

14:48.788 --> 14:51.591
You would be like,
"Tonight?

14:51.658 --> 14:54.594
We rented 'Batman,' um."

14:54.661 --> 14:55.795
Are you still watching?

14:55.862 --> 14:57.297
Yeah.

14:57.364 --> 15:00.133
Are you okay?

15:00.200 --> 15:02.469
It's weird to see him
right now.

15:02.535 --> 15:03.736
Why?

15:03.803 --> 15:07.074
I haven't talked to
Marc in ten years.

15:07.140 --> 15:09.609
That's crazy-- what?

15:09.676 --> 15:11.044
You guys
never made up?

15:11.111 --> 15:12.912
You guys were best friends
for years.

15:12.980 --> 15:14.314
I know.

15:14.381 --> 15:16.950
And then we had that thing
happen and it was--

15:17.017 --> 15:18.018
it was really bad.

15:18.085 --> 15:19.552
What even happened?

15:21.454 --> 15:24.257
Well-- Shit.

15:26.293 --> 15:28.128
He--

15:35.468 --> 15:36.569
Oh, my God.

15:36.636 --> 15:38.638
What?

15:38.705 --> 15:40.873
Oh...

15:40.940 --> 15:42.109
Oh, my God.

15:42.175 --> 15:43.776
Jesus, I've been--

15:43.843 --> 15:46.846
I've been mad at Marc
for ten years.

15:46.913 --> 15:48.115
You know, not actively

15:48.181 --> 15:50.217
but I wrote him off

15:50.283 --> 15:51.951
because he did this
really shitty thing to me

15:52.019 --> 15:53.853
and I just--

15:53.920 --> 15:55.855
he never apologized.

15:55.922 --> 15:57.690
I was done with him.

15:57.757 --> 15:59.492
And just now,
I realized

15:59.559 --> 16:02.295
that it was my fault.

16:02.362 --> 16:03.863
Really?

16:03.930 --> 16:06.566
Completely my fault.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.668
I'm stunned.

16:08.735 --> 16:12.972
I mean, I can't believe that
I ever blamed him for that.

16:13.040 --> 16:15.008
And it was...

16:15.075 --> 16:17.844
I was such
an asshole.

16:17.910 --> 16:19.312
Well, you grew up,
Louie.

16:19.379 --> 16:21.114
I mean, a lot's
happened to you

16:21.181 --> 16:23.516
in the past ten years,
and him too, I'm sure.

16:23.583 --> 16:26.486
This is good, it's growth,
you should call him.

16:26.553 --> 16:27.554
I don't know.

16:27.620 --> 16:28.721
I don't even think
I have a good number

16:28.788 --> 16:30.057
for him anymore.

16:30.123 --> 16:33.326
I have it, Lou,
call him right now.

16:34.694 --> 16:36.329
Okay, I will.

16:37.697 --> 16:39.599
( knocking )

16:41.801 --> 16:43.336
One second.

16:47.240 --> 16:48.808
Hey, man.
Hi.

16:48.875 --> 16:50.043
What's up?
How you doing?

16:50.110 --> 16:51.544
Thank you for--
Okay.

16:51.611 --> 16:53.012
I really appreciate you
having me over.

16:53.080 --> 16:54.481
Yeah, I...

16:54.547 --> 16:56.516
Of course.

16:56.583 --> 16:58.451
You want to--
you want to sit down, or--

16:58.518 --> 17:00.753
Sure.

17:00.820 --> 17:03.490
There's fine.

17:03.556 --> 17:05.492
What's up, man?

17:05.558 --> 17:07.760
Hey, uh, listen,
thank you, uh--

17:12.932 --> 17:14.634
This is kind of
hard to say, okay?

17:14.701 --> 17:17.370
I-- okay, look.

17:17.437 --> 17:22.209
You know we had that
fight, like, ten years ago?

17:22.275 --> 17:25.645
I-- I held that against you
for ten years

17:25.712 --> 17:27.847
and that's--

17:27.914 --> 17:29.416
that's hard to
even say because--

17:29.482 --> 17:31.451
Okay, I mean,
from my point of view,

17:31.518 --> 17:33.820
it's always been that you did
something really...

17:33.886 --> 17:35.322
really wrong to me

17:35.388 --> 17:38.391
and then you just
refused... that--

17:38.458 --> 17:40.693
I mean, that's the way that
I looked at it, you know?

17:40.760 --> 17:42.362
And, uh--

17:42.429 --> 17:44.497
So the other day, I was
thinking about it again,

17:44.564 --> 17:46.199
I guess I hadn't
really thought about it
for a long time,

17:46.266 --> 17:48.067
not in detail,

17:48.135 --> 17:49.236
and I really went over it
in my head, you know,

17:49.302 --> 17:51.238
I don't know why,

17:51.304 --> 17:56.743
and I realized that it was
my fault, completely.

17:56.809 --> 18:00.480
And it's like--
I was a total asshole to you

18:00.547 --> 18:02.249
and I stopped being
your friend

18:02.315 --> 18:05.585
and I'm shocked now
when I think of it.

18:05.652 --> 18:07.120
that I would ever have
thought it was

18:07.187 --> 18:08.321
anything that you did.

18:08.388 --> 18:10.857
You did nothing
and I-- and I--

18:10.923 --> 18:12.625
I know that now

18:12.692 --> 18:16.363
and I don't know how to--
how to, uh... look back--

18:16.429 --> 18:18.831
you know, you look back
at your actions and--

18:21.334 --> 18:22.935
Man, I don't know--

18:23.002 --> 18:24.571
I don't know if this
has any meaning

18:24.637 --> 18:27.640
or worth to
you and I don't--

18:27.707 --> 18:30.677
Maybe this is just more
of me being selfish,

18:30.743 --> 18:33.913
but I just wanna say, Marc,
that I'm sorry

18:33.980 --> 18:36.849
and I wish that, uh--

18:39.286 --> 18:41.454
Well, I don't know
what else to say.

18:43.523 --> 18:48.761
Okay, is--
is that it, or--

18:48.828 --> 18:51.264
Yeah, I guess so.

18:51.331 --> 18:52.599
All right, well,
I appreciate that,

18:52.665 --> 18:54.667
but I guess you don't
remember,

18:54.734 --> 18:56.603
but you came over
here five years ago

18:56.669 --> 18:59.406
and said the exact
same thing.

19:02.709 --> 19:03.843
I did?

19:03.910 --> 19:05.278
Yeah.

19:05.345 --> 19:06.679
I mean,
you cried that time.

19:06.746 --> 19:08.215
You didn't cry this time,
so that's--

19:08.281 --> 19:11.418
I guess that's something.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.753
Shit, I kind of
remember that now.
Yeah.

19:15.722 --> 19:17.690
Well, look,
I accepted that time,

19:17.757 --> 19:20.126
I don't know, this time--
whatever.

19:20.193 --> 19:21.294
I don't know what-- what--

19:21.361 --> 19:22.729
do you need something from me,
do you want--

19:22.795 --> 19:26.633
No, no.
I'm sorry.

19:26.699 --> 19:27.867
Okay, again?

19:27.934 --> 19:30.637
All right.
Okay, I'm--

19:30.703 --> 19:32.539
Okay.
Okay.

19:32.605 --> 19:34.307
We good then, are we...
Yeah, yeah, man,
okay, I'm sorry.

19:34.374 --> 19:35.942
Okay, all right.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.477
Uh...
It's all right.

19:37.544 --> 19:39.011
I mean, you know,
it happens.
Shit.

19:39.078 --> 19:40.813
Yeah... you know.
All right.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.315
All right, well...

19:42.382 --> 19:43.483
I really am sorry,
though, just so you know.

19:43.550 --> 19:44.517
Okay.

19:44.584 --> 19:46.319
Okay, I get it,
it's okay.

19:46.386 --> 19:47.854
You know what would be
really great, though?

19:47.920 --> 19:50.357
If maybe you call me up,
you ask me for coffee,

19:50.423 --> 19:51.824
we go out to dinner--
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:51.891 --> 19:53.526
Something like that?
Yeah, we'll do that.

19:53.593 --> 19:54.694
Okay, great.

19:54.761 --> 19:56.863
Or we can just do this again
in five years.

19:56.929 --> 19:58.431
Okay, man.
It's all right.

19:58.498 --> 20:00.867
Okay.
All right, all right, okay.

20:00.933 --> 20:02.269
How you been?
Good, man.

20:02.335 --> 20:03.536
That's very nice
for you to ask.

20:03.603 --> 20:05.672
Okay... okay?
All right, yeah.

20:05.738 --> 20:07.407
All right.

20:07.474 --> 20:10.677
Jesus.
That guy.

20:15.047 --> 20:17.317
( applauding )

20:17.384 --> 20:19.486
Jon Manfrellotti, folks.

20:19.552 --> 20:22.289
The guy who wrote "Kumbaya,"
Mr. Jon Manfrellotti.

20:22.355 --> 20:24.557
Oh, that's so sad.

20:24.624 --> 20:25.825
Why sad?

20:25.892 --> 20:27.594
Because he died.

20:27.660 --> 20:29.296
No, he didn't.

20:29.362 --> 20:31.130
He didn't die?

20:31.197 --> 20:32.932
No, he's completely alive.

20:32.999 --> 20:34.934
He's doing really well,
he writes for "Family Guy."

20:35.001 --> 20:37.236
Phew.

20:37.304 --> 20:38.771
Felt good being sad
for somebody.

20:38.838 --> 20:40.072
Who else died?

20:40.139 --> 20:41.974
Richard Nixon.

20:42.041 --> 20:43.610
Aww.

20:43.676 --> 20:46.679
Singing "Mack the Knife,"
you remember.

20:46.746 --> 20:48.247
We also have the heavy metal
country western band

20:48.315 --> 20:49.416
after that.

20:49.482 --> 20:50.650
"Jed Zeppelin."

20:50.717 --> 20:53.353
So, uh, please.
pace yourself.

20:53.420 --> 20:55.722
Gonna be a
long, slow show.
