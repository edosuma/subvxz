WEBVTT

00:10.211 --> 00:12.845
For the living and the dead,

00:12.847 --> 00:15.881
this is just a terrible place.

00:15.883 --> 00:18.951
Something is tearing
my family apart.

00:18.953 --> 00:22.287
This person is scary.

00:22.289 --> 00:25.024
I just know,
whatever it is, it's bad.

00:26.494 --> 00:29.395
It's physically painful
to be in here.

00:29.397 --> 00:32.464
Sickness is everywhere.

00:32.466 --> 00:34.666
I just hear death.
<i> -Aah!</i>

00:34.668 --> 00:36.902
My name is Amy Allan.

00:36.904 --> 00:38.537
God.

00:38.539 --> 00:40.039
It's like,
"I'm going to get you."

00:40.041 --> 00:41.140
I see dead people.

00:41.142 --> 00:42.408
Her face was all demonic.

00:42.410 --> 00:44.143
I speak to dead people.

00:44.145 --> 00:46.945
He's like, "You think you can
stop me? Because you can't."

00:46.947 --> 00:48.347
And they speak to me.

00:48.349 --> 00:49.882
What is he trying to do?
Kill them.

00:49.884 --> 00:53.018
But there's only one way to know
if my findings are real.

00:53.020 --> 00:55.020
Something happened.
Bam, bam, bam!

00:55.022 --> 00:56.588
I rely on my partner.

00:56.590 --> 00:58.157
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

00:58.159 --> 00:59.892
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

00:59.894 --> 01:01.393
Am I seeing
what I think I'm seeing?

01:01.395 --> 01:04.596
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:04.598 --> 01:05.764
They're everywhere.

01:05.766 --> 01:07.166
It's my job to reveal them.

01:07.168 --> 01:09.535
This guy's got the markings
of a serial killer.

01:09.537 --> 01:12.037
But Steve and I never speak...

01:12.039 --> 01:14.106
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:14.108 --> 01:15.307
...until the very end...

01:15.309 --> 01:16.975
Is this dead guy
doing that to her?

01:16.977 --> 01:18.844
...when we uncover
if it's safe for you to stay...

01:18.846 --> 01:20.946
That's it.

01:20.948 --> 01:22.214
...or time to get out.

01:22.216 --> 01:25.717
Somebody's gonna die
over there soon, yeah.

01:25.719 --> 01:26.819
<i> Aaaaaah!</i>

01:28.000 --> 01:34.074

01:43.270 --> 01:44.770
I'm out here in Kaufman, Texas.

01:44.772 --> 01:48.140
It's about 35 miles
southeast of Dallas.

01:48.142 --> 01:49.575
I got a call
from a guy named Larry.

01:49.577 --> 01:52.978
Now, this guy's got
a real problem on his hands.

01:52.980 --> 01:54.646
He says paranormal activity
in the house

01:54.648 --> 01:56.348
already broke up his marriage

01:56.350 --> 02:00.152
and, now, his three daughters
are coming under attack.

02:00.154 --> 02:01.386
He says we're his last hope

02:01.388 --> 02:03.021
to bring his family
back together.

02:03.023 --> 02:04.523
I really hope we can
help this poor guy out.

02:10.431 --> 02:11.864
Before Amy arrives,

02:11.866 --> 02:14.733
I clear the house
of any leading information.

02:14.735 --> 02:16.635
Family photos
and religious items

02:16.637 --> 02:18.504
must be covered or removed.

02:18.506 --> 02:20.305
When I'm finished,
the location'll be ready

02:20.307 --> 02:21.540
for tonight's walk.

02:36.957 --> 02:39.791
That's weird.

02:39.793 --> 02:43.562
Something's wrong here.

02:43.564 --> 02:46.298
It feels,
really horrible

02:46.300 --> 02:51.637
and it's just like this
sickness is just everywhere.

02:51.639 --> 02:54.173
And then, there's like this
depression, this depression.

02:54.175 --> 02:56.375
And it's scary.
Something going on.

02:56.377 --> 02:57.809
And it's huge.
It's so bad.

02:57.811 --> 02:59.077
And you just wanna run away.

02:59.079 --> 03:02.714
And you want to run
the **** away.

03:15.963 --> 03:17.629
All right. So, Larry,
when we spoke on the phone,

03:17.631 --> 03:19.164
you sounded pretty upset.

03:19.166 --> 03:21.166
What the hell's going on?

03:21.168 --> 03:24.536
Something is tearing
my family apart.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.905
Relationships
have gone to hell.

03:26.907 --> 03:29.942
My wife finally got
to the point

03:29.944 --> 03:34.413
where she just asked me
to move out.

03:34.415 --> 03:36.381
She was my golden girl
and I figured that we'd

03:36.383 --> 03:39.651
live the rest of our lives
together, 'til we died.

03:39.653 --> 03:41.653
That's just not
the way it happened.

03:41.655 --> 03:42.988
Why would you think
it's the paranormal

03:42.990 --> 03:44.189
that broke up your marriage?

03:44.191 --> 03:46.592
Something is wanting
to take control

03:46.594 --> 03:48.193
of the women in the house

03:48.195 --> 03:51.463
and trying to get rid
of all of the men.

03:51.465 --> 03:53.732
All right. So this is
a pretty unusual arrangement

03:53.734 --> 03:54.967
you guys got going here.

03:54.969 --> 03:56.301
Now, who's living where?

03:56.303 --> 03:58.303
I'm living in this
house over here

03:58.305 --> 04:00.138
and my wife
and my three daughters

04:00.140 --> 04:01.940
are living in this
house over here.

04:01.942 --> 04:03.141
Okay.
- Matter of fact,

04:03.143 --> 04:04.977
I've got a picture
of my family

04:04.979 --> 04:06.979
that's staying
at that house.

04:06.981 --> 04:08.914
Okay. So who's this?
- This is Chelsea.

04:08.916 --> 04:11.250
Next to her is Denise,
my wife.

04:11.252 --> 04:13.518
Okay.
- Next to her is Brittany,

04:13.520 --> 04:15.287
my oldest daughter.

04:15.289 --> 04:17.623
And that's Ashley,
my middle daughter.

04:17.625 --> 04:19.057
All right.
So, Larry, do me favor.

04:19.059 --> 04:20.459
Give me a list
of what's going on here.

04:20.461 --> 04:22.361
We hear voices.

04:22.363 --> 04:24.663
We see shadows.

04:24.665 --> 04:28.000
We're having physical
attacks on the girls,

04:28.002 --> 04:31.236
that's causing
health issues.

04:31.238 --> 04:33.639
I've got
rheumatoid arthritis.

04:33.641 --> 04:36.308
I've got degenerative
bone disease,

04:36.310 --> 04:38.343
suffering
from depression.

04:38.345 --> 04:39.845
I had a heart attack.

04:39.847 --> 04:42.748
My wife had
thyroid cancer.

04:42.750 --> 04:45.183
So, Larry, I gotta ask ya:
how old are ya?

04:45.185 --> 04:46.952
Sixty.
- I mean, the ailments

04:46.954 --> 04:48.954
you're talking about are
for a much older man

04:48.956 --> 04:50.289
and I can't help
but notice the walker.

04:50.291 --> 04:52.257
What's with the walker?

04:52.259 --> 04:54.226
Well, me and my
daughter Ashley

04:54.228 --> 04:56.228
got into an altercation.

04:56.230 --> 04:57.696
She downright kicked me,

04:57.698 --> 04:59.431
broke the crap
outta my leg

04:59.433 --> 05:02.701
in three
different places.

05:02.703 --> 05:05.704
It was like
something took over.

05:05.706 --> 05:08.707
What do you
want out of this investigation?

05:08.709 --> 05:11.176
I want whatever
is here is gone,

05:11.178 --> 05:13.578
so that me and my wife
and my family

05:13.580 --> 05:15.213
can all be a family
again.

05:20.487 --> 05:25.857
There's somebody here
who's having really,

05:25.859 --> 05:27.893
really bad knee issues.

05:37.304 --> 05:40.872
I see like a woman.

05:40.874 --> 05:43.075
And she's like screaming.

05:46.480 --> 05:53.819
And I'm seeing her like
running after a man.

05:53.821 --> 05:56.455
She's beating him.
Very abusive.

05:56.457 --> 06:00.759
It's very abusive.
Very bad, very bad.

06:00.761 --> 06:02.294
He's running away from her.

06:02.296 --> 06:05.397
She's screaming
at the top of her lungs.

06:05.399 --> 06:09.368
I'm getting like chills
down my back.

06:09.370 --> 06:10.936
It's so **** negative.

06:18.112 --> 06:20.245
Okay. So what kind
of experiences are you having?

06:20.247 --> 06:21.346
I got attacked.

06:21.348 --> 06:25.851
I got slapped real hard,
twice, on the arm

06:25.853 --> 06:28.487
and it made me bolt
out of bed.

06:28.489 --> 06:30.789
It freaked me out.

06:30.791 --> 06:32.524
I went
into the bathroom

06:32.526 --> 06:34.926
and I lifted up
my nightshirt

06:34.928 --> 06:38.397
and there was three
scratches on my belly

06:38.399 --> 06:41.767
and my lower rib cage
on my right side.

06:41.769 --> 06:44.035
Now, I know there's dogs
all over the place.

06:44.037 --> 06:45.604
You sure the dog
didn't do this?

06:45.606 --> 06:47.305
The marks were
so far apart.

06:47.307 --> 06:49.141
It was bigger
than my dog's paw.

06:49.143 --> 06:52.344
There's no way that my dogs
coulda made those marks.

06:52.346 --> 06:54.780
All right.
So, anything else?

06:54.782 --> 06:58.016
We see shadow figures
and they've gotta be,

06:58.018 --> 07:01.853
I would say,
every bit of 10, 11 feet.

07:01.855 --> 07:02.988
They're everywhere.

07:02.990 --> 07:05.157
I feel somebody's
in the room with me

07:05.159 --> 07:08.059
and I know that
there's no one there.

07:08.061 --> 07:09.327
I need answers.

07:09.329 --> 07:12.464
Something's just
tearing us apart.

07:12.466 --> 07:13.965
Okay.

07:16.303 --> 07:19.504
I see an old, old man.

07:19.506 --> 07:22.507
And he's creeping about.

07:22.509 --> 07:24.576
Living people with him
would feel watched.

07:24.578 --> 07:30.348
Maybe they might see a shadow
like that on the wall.

07:30.350 --> 07:31.950
He is a creepy mother****.

07:35.122 --> 07:40.125
I think there's like a <i> lot</i>
of stuff going on here.

07:46.767 --> 07:48.733
So, Denise,
I was talking to Larry.

07:48.735 --> 07:50.202
He was pretty convinced

07:50.204 --> 07:52.137
that the paranormal
broke you and him up.

07:52.139 --> 07:55.073
You agree with that?
- No. I don't.

07:55.075 --> 07:56.608
People's relationships
don't work out

07:56.610 --> 07:58.610
all the time
and people walk away.

07:58.612 --> 08:00.579
And I assume you don't believe
in the paranormal.

08:00.581 --> 08:02.948
No. I do believe
in paranormal.

08:02.950 --> 08:05.417
It's terrorizing my --
my family.

08:05.419 --> 08:06.818
Have you had
any experiences?

08:06.820 --> 08:09.154
Yes. We've had
a family photo

08:09.156 --> 08:12.090
that fell on the floor.
- Where was it?

08:12.092 --> 08:15.994
It's in the entryway,
on a like a mantelpiece

08:15.996 --> 08:17.629
and it was sitting
up there

08:17.631 --> 08:19.631
and it just fell off.

08:19.633 --> 08:21.132
Got a bunch
of dogs here, right?

08:21.134 --> 08:23.335
- Yeah.
- Sure one of the dogs didn't?

08:23.337 --> 08:25.670
No. They had been
asleep on the couch.

08:25.672 --> 08:27.539
Okay.
Well, talking to Larry,

08:27.541 --> 08:30.475
he thinks the paranormal
is causing health problems here.

08:30.477 --> 08:32.711
You agree with that?
- I do believe that.

08:32.712 --> 08:34.679
Now, I, you know, I hate
to say this, but, I mean,

08:34.681 --> 08:36.548
Larry's 60, right?
- Yes.

08:36.549 --> 08:38.517
He doesn't look good
for his age.

08:38.519 --> 08:40.318
No. He looks more
like 80.

08:40.320 --> 08:41.720
If he keeps going
the way he's going,

08:41.722 --> 08:45.056
he's going to end up dying
a very premature death.

08:45.058 --> 08:48.426
I don't want his children
to have to go through,

08:48.428 --> 08:50.028
you know,
what I've gone through.

08:50.030 --> 08:51.630
What do you mean by that?

08:51.632 --> 08:53.532
I had a stepfather
who raised me

08:53.534 --> 08:57.569
and he died
25 years ago, so.

08:57.571 --> 09:00.005
He was murdered.

09:00.007 --> 09:02.807
It was very rough
'cause we were very close.

09:02.809 --> 09:04.442
I would never
want my children

09:04.444 --> 09:07.479
to have to go through that
'cause it was bad.

09:16.590 --> 09:19.958
Horrible, horrible,
negative energy.

09:19.960 --> 09:26.464
It feels like I'm walking
through sludge, like

09:26.466 --> 09:27.899
Somebody lost someone.

09:27.901 --> 09:30.335
Someone can't breathe.

09:30.337 --> 09:33.772
Can't breathe because
they lost this person.

09:33.774 --> 09:38.376
Whoever's here isn't
getting over that, at all.

09:38.378 --> 09:40.312
He didn't die here.

09:40.314 --> 09:43.381
He died far away, recent,

09:43.383 --> 09:46.184
anywhere from 1990
to now, maybe.

09:46.186 --> 09:47.619
This guy's a good guy.

09:47.621 --> 09:50.622
He's trying to get away
from here, but he can't.

09:50.624 --> 09:52.557
There's like
an energetic cord

09:52.559 --> 09:55.293
that's formed
between this dead man

09:55.295 --> 09:59.531
and a living person
he had a relationship with.

09:59.533 --> 10:01.633
All I saw was them
pulling this cord

10:01.635 --> 10:06.237
and he's like "Aaaaah!
No! No!"

10:06.239 --> 10:07.639
Not a happy situation.

10:27.527 --> 10:29.260
So, Chelsea, I understand
you're the youngest

10:29.262 --> 10:30.795
of the three girls, correct?
- Yes.

10:30.797 --> 10:32.130
- Okay. How old are you?
- I'm 20.

10:32.132 --> 10:35.834
- Have you had any experiences?
- Yes. I had a experience

10:35.836 --> 10:38.169
where I was sleeping
in my bed

10:38.171 --> 10:40.705
and I heard something
like whisper, "Hey."

10:40.707 --> 10:43.074
And I could feel the hair
move next to my ear

10:43.076 --> 10:45.143
and I like woke up
out of a dead sleep,

10:45.145 --> 10:47.879
like with shivers
down my spine.

10:47.881 --> 10:50.081
You sure you weren't dreaming?
- Yes.

10:50.083 --> 10:51.816
Okay. Anything else?

10:51.818 --> 10:54.853
Lately, I've been getting
phantom bruising on my leg.

10:54.855 --> 10:56.121
Where on the leg
would it hit you?

10:56.123 --> 10:59.024
It's like the inner thigh
or sometimes, it'll be

10:59.026 --> 11:01.192
on the back of my arms.

11:01.194 --> 11:02.394
I actually have
a picture.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.566
Jeez. No dogs
in that room with you?

11:08.568 --> 11:09.801
No.

11:09.803 --> 11:11.036
All right.
Anything else?

11:11.038 --> 11:14.406
I've had dreams of a family
getting murdered.

11:14.408 --> 11:15.807
Really?
- Yes.

11:15.809 --> 11:19.010
And then, I also
had dreams of my sister

11:19.012 --> 11:21.913
committing suicide
in our bathroom.

11:21.915 --> 11:24.282
Which sister?
- Brittany.

11:24.284 --> 11:26.384
She hung herself
from the shower stall.

11:26.386 --> 11:29.187
She told me it was something
I had to let her do,

11:29.189 --> 11:32.223
so I just watched her
do it, in my dream.

11:32.225 --> 11:34.392
I mean, is that something
you worry about?

11:34.394 --> 11:36.728
She's never been that way,
so, for me to just

11:36.730 --> 11:38.496
have that dream
was really off the wall.

11:38.498 --> 11:40.098
All right, so,
with dreams like that,

11:40.100 --> 11:41.733
it's gotta be tough,
sleeping in your bedroom.

11:41.735 --> 11:43.501
I actually don't sleep
in here anymore.

11:43.503 --> 11:45.303
I sleep with my mom.

11:45.305 --> 11:47.672
Why?
- It's so embarrassing, but,

11:47.674 --> 11:50.341
I- I don't feel safe
to sleep in my room.

11:53.714 --> 11:55.480
I'm seeing a dead woman in here.

11:55.482 --> 11:58.283
I think she was murdered.

11:58.285 --> 11:59.851
She comes
right through the wall.

11:59.853 --> 12:02.454
She's trying to reach
whoever's in this bed.

12:02.456 --> 12:06.591
I know she tries to talk

12:06.593 --> 12:08.626
'cause she saying,
"Help me. Help me."

12:08.628 --> 12:12.797
She's trying to get them
through dreams.

12:12.799 --> 12:17.936
Feel like she,
can get physical?

12:17.938 --> 12:22.307
I'm hearing smacking,
enough to wake them up.

12:22.309 --> 12:25.076
I don't like it.

12:25.078 --> 12:26.578
I don't like it.

12:32.552 --> 12:35.220
Seems like everybody in
the house is having experiences.

12:35.222 --> 12:36.721
Now, what about yourself?

12:36.723 --> 12:40.558
I've seen a massive
shadow in here.

12:40.560 --> 12:41.926
Okay.
Can you describe it to me?

12:41.928 --> 12:45.096
It was huge. It almost
touched the ceiling,

12:45.098 --> 12:46.998
basically took up
the whole wall.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.500
How are you sleeping
at night?

12:48.502 --> 12:50.769
I do suffer
from anxiety.

12:50.771 --> 12:53.104
So, my mind races
at night.

12:53.106 --> 12:54.672
I think of everything
and nothing,

12:54.674 --> 12:57.442
all at the same time.

12:57.444 --> 12:59.544
What do you think is here?

12:59.546 --> 13:04.048
I think whatever is here
just messes with us

13:04.050 --> 13:05.216
in different ways,

13:05.218 --> 13:07.986
brings out the worst
in people.

13:07.988 --> 13:09.387
We were once so happy

13:09.389 --> 13:12.457
and our family's
being torn apart.

13:12.459 --> 13:14.692
Okay. It upsets you?

13:14.694 --> 13:16.628
Yes.

13:16.630 --> 13:17.629
You okay?

13:21.668 --> 13:26.971
For the living and the dead,
this is just a terrible place.

13:26.973 --> 13:30.441
I don't know how
they can be in here.

13:30.443 --> 13:32.944
Like it's physically painful
to be in here.

13:32.946 --> 13:35.680
And it's all depression,

13:35.682 --> 13:39.884
depression, horrible,
horrible depression.

13:39.886 --> 13:42.854
This room is completely
filled with it,

13:42.856 --> 13:45.089
like just this black goop.

13:45.091 --> 13:49.327
This black goop is literally
coming out of the walls.

13:49.329 --> 13:53.965
- So what is this?
- It seems to be a collection

13:53.967 --> 13:58.536
of negative thoughts,
feelings, and emotions

13:58.538 --> 14:04.809
that are pushed out
of a living person.

14:07.881 --> 14:12.584
This kind of negativity
can cause like

14:12.586 --> 14:17.355
mentally illnesses,
physical illnesses.

14:17.357 --> 14:21.059
It could cause them to do
and act irrationally.

14:22.963 --> 14:24.329
It's really bad.

14:30.837 --> 14:33.771
So, Ashley, you're the girl
that broke your dad's leg.

14:33.773 --> 14:35.807
That right?
- Yeah.

14:35.809 --> 14:37.342
Now, you know
he doesn't blame you.

14:37.344 --> 14:40.211
He blames the paranormal.

14:40.213 --> 14:41.379
Yeah.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.214
Do you agree with that?

14:43.216 --> 14:46.484
He was acting pretty
weird that day, so.

14:46.486 --> 14:50.221
Okay. Your family,
you think they're in danger?

14:50.223 --> 14:52.357
Yeah. I believe
wholeheartedly

14:52.359 --> 14:54.993
that they're in danger.

14:54.995 --> 14:56.561
You've had experiences,
I'm assuming.

14:56.563 --> 14:58.229
Yes. I've had many.

14:58.231 --> 14:59.964
Why don't you tell me
about some of 'em?

14:59.966 --> 15:02.634
The night
that my boyfriend

15:02.636 --> 15:04.402
had proposed to me,

15:04.404 --> 15:07.105
when I came home
that night,

15:07.107 --> 15:08.873
I was going to bed
- Okay.

15:08.875 --> 15:13.544
and, when I got up,
about 3:00 am,

15:13.546 --> 15:16.347
my pants were off

15:16.349 --> 15:19.484
and they were placed
by my pillow.

15:19.486 --> 15:21.352
So, was your boyfriend
here with you?

15:21.354 --> 15:23.187
- No.
- So you were in bed alone?

15:26.493 --> 15:29.594
Okay. You okay?

15:29.596 --> 15:33.598
Yeah. I'll be okay.

15:33.600 --> 15:36.367
I'm sorry, sweetie.

15:36.369 --> 15:39.304
I couldn't even imagine
waking up and seeing that.

15:39.306 --> 15:44.575
There were bruises
on my thighs, too.

15:44.577 --> 15:46.945
I showed my mom.

15:46.947 --> 15:48.947
They really
freaked her out.

15:48.949 --> 15:50.448
Yeah.

15:50.450 --> 15:52.450
And then,
you know, then,

15:52.452 --> 15:54.986
that's when the blowup
with my dad happened.

15:58.758 --> 16:01.125
What do you think's
going on in this house?

16:01.127 --> 16:03.094
I don't know, honestly.

16:03.096 --> 16:05.396
I just know, whatever
it is, it's bad.

16:19.312 --> 16:21.579
Kaufman <i> is</i> small-town America.

16:21.581 --> 16:23.648
This place is like Mayberry.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.016
So, when I asked a genealogist

16:25.018 --> 16:27.085
to look into
the property for me,

16:27.087 --> 16:29.253
she said she already
knew all about it

16:29.255 --> 16:30.788
and that one of the
original families

16:30.790 --> 16:32.390
had a riches-to-rags story

16:32.392 --> 16:34.158
I'm definitely gonna
wanna hear about.

16:38.932 --> 16:41.632
So, Rebecca, before we get
to this riches-to-rags story,

16:41.634 --> 16:44.168
who were the original owners
and when did they

16:44.170 --> 16:46.104
actually purchase the land
I'm investigating?

16:46.106 --> 16:47.805
The original owner
of this property

16:47.807 --> 16:49.574
was Thomas Shannon.

16:49.576 --> 16:53.911
He purchased over
1,100 acres in 1882.

16:53.913 --> 16:55.179
So what did he do with it?

16:55.181 --> 16:57.015
He farmed this property.

16:57.017 --> 16:59.017
So, even though they didn't
have the easiest time,

16:59.019 --> 17:01.319
they were able to have
a prosperous farm

17:01.321 --> 17:02.987
in this place.
- Okay. So what do you mean by,

17:02.989 --> 17:04.222
"They didn't have
the easiest time"?

17:04.223 --> 17:07.759
Three of Thomas Shannon's
children, and his wife, died

17:07.761 --> 17:09.694
in a very short
period of time.

17:09.695 --> 17:11.029
While they were
on that property?

17:11.031 --> 17:13.231
Correct.
Thomas Shannon, himself,

17:13.233 --> 17:14.799
actually died on the
property as well,

17:14.800 --> 17:16.501
in 1906.

17:16.502 --> 17:17.935
Okay.
What'd he die of?

17:17.936 --> 17:19.470
Well, we can see
in his death certificate

17:19.472 --> 17:22.740
right here, basically,
he died of exhaustion.

17:22.742 --> 17:24.108
Exhaustion?

17:24.109 --> 17:26.844
So how old was he
at the time of his death?

17:26.846 --> 17:28.946
- He was 66.
- All right.

17:28.948 --> 17:31.716
So, now, Thomas Shannon is dead.
Who gets the property?

17:31.718 --> 17:33.751
Well, it changes hands
a couple times

17:33.753 --> 17:36.687
and it ends up with
his grandson Shannon Jones.

17:36.689 --> 17:38.489
All right. So now, the grandson
has the property.

17:38.491 --> 17:40.024
What's he wind up
doing with it?

17:40.026 --> 17:42.727
Well, he's not able to
hold on to the property.

17:42.729 --> 17:44.362
Unfortunately,
he doesn't seem to have

17:44.364 --> 17:46.931
the capitalist gift
of his grandfather

17:46.933 --> 17:49.333
and, from this date
in 1922,

17:49.335 --> 17:53.471
we see him selling
the property off.

17:53.473 --> 17:55.907
All right. So what winds up
happening with Jones?

17:55.909 --> 17:58.176
Shannon Jones dies
of a heart attack,

17:58.178 --> 18:00.278
actually, in 1948.

18:00.280 --> 18:03.147
So he's 55,
which is young.

18:03.149 --> 18:05.650
And the doctor mentions
it's from overwork.

18:05.652 --> 18:06.984
Yeah. I see that on there.

18:06.986 --> 18:08.286
Basically,
he worked himself to death.

18:08.288 --> 18:11.823
Yes.

18:11.825 --> 18:17.829
I see an angry man
in his 30s or 40s.

18:17.831 --> 18:21.399
I would think it was
between 1930 and 1950s?

18:21.401 --> 18:26.037
And he was out and there was
nothing, nothing, nothing,

18:26.039 --> 18:29.307
except for <i> dirt,</i>
a lot of <i> dirt,</i>

18:29.309 --> 18:33.845
and he's freaking
the **** out.

18:33.847 --> 18:37.782
He started screaming and yelling
that he can't do it anymore.

18:37.784 --> 18:38.983
He had money.

18:38.985 --> 18:40.551
I just see the bank.

18:40.553 --> 18:45.289
But then, I see all these papers
and someone -- on a desk --

18:45.291 --> 18:46.791
and someone's taking a stamp

18:46.793 --> 18:49.560
and stamping the word "Bank"
on these papers.

18:49.562 --> 18:53.064
So it's one after the other,
Bank, Bank, Bank.

18:53.066 --> 18:55.466
Then, he thinks, "I'm gonna
**** shoot myself."

18:58.905 --> 19:01.072
So far, I've got a house
full of women who say

19:01.074 --> 19:03.441
they're getting physically
attacked on a property

19:03.443 --> 19:06.377
that's seen
at least five deaths.

19:06.379 --> 19:08.913
But I wanna see
if there's anything else.

19:08.915 --> 19:11.682
Searching through old records,
I find Charlie Ice,

19:11.684 --> 19:13.885
one of the property's
previous owners.

19:13.887 --> 19:16.687
Turns out Charlie had
some dirty laundry.

19:16.689 --> 19:19.957
Weeks after his wife died,
he married her young caretaker.

19:22.495 --> 19:23.861
I'm on my way to meet a local

19:23.863 --> 19:26.597
who knew everyone involved
in this scandal and she says

19:26.599 --> 19:30.368
the nurse was volatile,
unstable, and violent.

19:34.340 --> 19:36.807
I understand that you grew up
in this town

19:36.809 --> 19:39.343
and you knew Charlie Ice,
or knew of him.

19:39.345 --> 19:44.048
Yes. This is a photo
of Charlie.

19:44.050 --> 19:46.584
This is his first wife,
Opal.

19:48.688 --> 19:50.321
So, when does Charlie Ice

19:50.323 --> 19:52.356
wind up getting
my client's property?

19:52.358 --> 19:53.991
1953.

19:53.993 --> 19:55.459
So, take me through
this scandal.

19:55.461 --> 19:57.461
What happened?

19:57.463 --> 20:00.131
This is Mary and,
evidently, he had been

20:00.133 --> 20:03.768
having an affair with her
for quite a while.

20:03.770 --> 20:06.837
It seems as though
he had a love child.

20:06.839 --> 20:09.540
A love child?
How do we know that?

20:09.542 --> 20:12.877
Because his name is
on that birth certificate.

20:12.879 --> 20:15.012
Okay. Yeah.
He's the father on here.

20:15.014 --> 20:16.647
How old was Charlie,
at the time?

20:16.649 --> 20:19.116
Charlie is 44.

20:19.118 --> 20:21.052
Mary is 20.

20:21.054 --> 20:24.755
When Opal gets sick
in 1968,

20:24.757 --> 20:29.727
he employs Mary
to take care of Opal.

20:29.729 --> 20:32.663
She and the child
move in.

20:32.665 --> 20:34.832
You're kidding me.

20:34.834 --> 20:36.133
All right,
so I know Opal dies.

20:36.135 --> 20:38.636
When and what
did she die of?

20:38.638 --> 20:42.039
She dies in 1968,
at the age of 58,

20:42.041 --> 20:46.410
from a blood clot
in the lung.

20:46.412 --> 20:48.112
Three weeks later,

20:48.114 --> 20:52.350
Charlie marries
Mary Louise Winkler.

20:52.352 --> 20:55.386
Okay.
How's that go for them?

20:55.388 --> 20:59.390
Well, evidently,
not as <i> he</i> had planned.

20:59.392 --> 21:02.860
She had a temper,
she had outbursts,

21:02.862 --> 21:05.630
and sometimes,
she was violent.

21:05.632 --> 21:07.398
All right. So, how long
are these two married?

21:07.400 --> 21:08.933
Seven years.

21:08.935 --> 21:11.636
He died suddenly
of a heart attack.

21:11.638 --> 21:13.571
All right. So do we know
if Mary's still alive?

21:13.573 --> 21:19.010
She died in 2013,
of Alzheimer's.

21:21.147 --> 21:23.481
I'm getting a female.

21:23.483 --> 21:26.417
And I'm hearing "mother,"
mother and grandmother.

21:26.419 --> 21:27.818
I'm wondering like
if this is somebody

21:27.820 --> 21:32.290
who just lived here
and recently died here.

21:32.292 --> 21:38.129
I wanna say like maybe late 30s
to like, you know, 50.

21:38.131 --> 21:40.364
This person is scary.

21:42.001 --> 21:45.903
They're <i> extremely</i> abusive.

21:45.905 --> 21:47.705
There's a physical
illness, though,

21:47.707 --> 21:51.208
that is involving
their head, that's bad.

22:06.526 --> 22:08.726
One other thing
caught my eye in research:

22:08.728 --> 22:10.795
a young schoolteacher
who was brutally murdered

22:10.797 --> 22:12.029
on the side of the road

22:12.031 --> 22:14.098
right near Larry
and Denise's property.

22:14.100 --> 22:16.233
Now, I don't know if this
is gonna help my case,

22:16.235 --> 22:18.336
but I'm meeting with
the Kaufman County Sheriff

22:18.338 --> 22:19.537
to see exactly what happened.

22:27.347 --> 22:29.547
So, Sheriff, before we get
to the actual homicide,

22:29.549 --> 22:31.315
what do we know
about the victim?

22:31.317 --> 22:33.217
Her name was
Linda Jane Phillips

22:33.219 --> 22:36.320
and I have
a picture of her.

22:36.322 --> 22:38.923
She was 26 years of age.

22:38.925 --> 22:39.990
She graduated from

22:39.992 --> 22:43.928
North Texas State
University in 1966

22:43.930 --> 22:46.897
and subsequently became
a schoolteacher in Dallas.

22:46.899 --> 22:49.200
Okay.
- She was teaching in Dallas

22:49.202 --> 22:51.335
and living in Dallas,
but still, apparently,

22:51.337 --> 22:53.838
had a very close relationship
with her family

22:53.840 --> 22:56.340
and would still spend
the summers here.

23:02.081 --> 23:04.115
I'm seeing
the murdered woman again.

23:07.320 --> 23:10.054
And I got the name either
Linda or Lily with her,

23:10.056 --> 23:12.723
something with an L --
Leelee?

23:12.725 --> 23:16.360
She was between 25
and 35 years old, very small.

23:16.362 --> 23:18.396
She was superthin

23:18.398 --> 23:24.368
and she's <i> all</i> kinds of
scared and pissed.

23:24.370 --> 23:25.569
So, take me through
the night of the murder.

23:25.571 --> 23:26.670
What happened?

23:26.672 --> 23:28.406
August 8th of 1970,

23:28.408 --> 23:32.209
she attended a wedding
party in Dallas

23:32.211 --> 23:34.178
and subsequently
called her parents

23:34.180 --> 23:36.714
at about 10:30
and told them

23:36.716 --> 23:37.915
she would not be
coming home.

23:37.917 --> 23:40.117
She was gonna stay
with a girlfriend.

23:40.119 --> 23:42.787
She never arrived there.

23:42.789 --> 23:44.955
The car was found

23:44.957 --> 23:47.191
during the search
on the 9th of August.

23:47.193 --> 23:48.259
Okay.

23:48.261 --> 23:49.794
And then,

23:49.796 --> 23:52.196
approximately
20 hours later,

23:52.198 --> 23:53.531
her body was found,

23:53.533 --> 23:55.266
approximately
3 miles from there.

23:58.571 --> 24:02.006
26 stab wounds.

24:02.008 --> 24:03.774
"Lacerations of Neck
& Abdomen."

24:06.779 --> 24:08.279
Jeez.

24:08.281 --> 24:12.416
Subsequent investigation
and autopsy revealed

24:12.418 --> 24:14.385
that she'd been
sexually assaulted.

24:14.387 --> 24:15.986
Anybody arrested for this?

24:15.988 --> 24:18.823
14 years later, in 1984,

24:18.825 --> 24:21.725
the self-confessed
mass murderer

24:21.727 --> 24:23.961
named Henry Lee Lucas
confessed to it.

24:23.963 --> 24:25.863
I know Henry Lee Lucas.

24:25.865 --> 24:27.364
He confessed to a lot
of murders, this guy.

24:27.366 --> 24:28.566
He did.

24:28.568 --> 24:29.867
What was your impression?

24:29.869 --> 24:31.368
He was a liar.

24:31.370 --> 24:33.671
What's your opinion on it?
Do you think Henry Lee did it?

24:33.673 --> 24:35.439
I don't believe he did.

24:35.441 --> 24:37.441
Okay.
- There's no evidence

24:37.443 --> 24:38.843
that he did it,
other than his word,

24:38.845 --> 24:42.713
and obviously, his word
is not not good.

24:42.715 --> 24:44.615
So the killer
could still be out there.

24:44.617 --> 24:45.850
Yes.

24:45.852 --> 24:47.117
Okay.

24:52.959 --> 24:56.460
She's so wrapped up
in how she **** died.

24:56.462 --> 24:59.196
It was somewhere in Texas.

24:59.198 --> 25:01.699
And she was wearing
a really pretty dress.

25:01.701 --> 25:05.135
Boyfriend comes in
and then, these two big like

25:05.137 --> 25:08.973
strong-arm dudes come in
and they took her.

25:08.975 --> 25:10.674
They throw her in this old car.
<i> -Aaaagh!</i>

25:10.676 --> 25:13.577
One's in the back
and he's **** beating
the **** out of her.

25:15.581 --> 25:17.615
There's also

25:17.617 --> 25:20.084
sexual stuff happening.

25:20.086 --> 25:23.821
And she sees her arm
being cut off.

25:23.823 --> 25:24.889
With what?

25:24.891 --> 25:27.525
I think it was like
a **** knife.

25:27.527 --> 25:30.594
I know they did
something here, too.

25:30.596 --> 25:35.065
You know? So this is all
**** up, like cut open.

25:35.067 --> 25:37.167
And then, she passed out
and then,

25:37.169 --> 25:39.937
they did something to her

25:39.939 --> 25:42.506
neck or head, or something.

25:42.508 --> 25:45.109
Then, they scattered her body
parts along the road.

25:53.553 --> 25:56.053
I saw several disturbing
things on my walk,

25:56.055 --> 25:59.056
but the bedroom filled
with big, black, negative goop

25:59.058 --> 26:01.725
has me the most concerned.

26:01.727 --> 26:03.661
There's this little hallway.

26:03.663 --> 26:05.796
The bedroom door is open.

26:05.798 --> 26:11.135
The room was filled with black,
gelatinous stuff.

26:11.137 --> 26:13.971
It's like spilling
into the hallway.

26:18.411 --> 26:19.777
Amy,

26:19.779 --> 26:22.046
is this what you saw?

26:22.048 --> 26:23.581
Yes. That's what I saw.

26:43.803 --> 26:46.704
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

26:46.706 --> 26:48.806
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

26:48.808 --> 26:51.875
and our clients,
for the first time.

26:51.877 --> 26:54.478
So, Amy, this case
is a bit unusual.

26:54.480 --> 26:57.448
This is Larry.
He lives next house over.

26:57.450 --> 27:00.618
This is his estranged
wife, Denise.

27:00.620 --> 27:04.321
She lives here with Brittany;

27:04.323 --> 27:08.759
Ashley; and Chelsea,
her youngest daughter.

27:08.761 --> 27:10.861
Now, Larry thinks
the paranormal activity

27:10.863 --> 27:14.765
ripped his family apart and got
him kicked out of the house.

27:14.767 --> 27:17.134
The ladies aren't buying that.

27:17.136 --> 27:18.936
But everyone agrees
the activity

27:18.938 --> 27:22.873
is getting worse and more
violent and it's gotta stop.

27:22.875 --> 27:24.141
So, now that Amy knows
a little bit

27:24.143 --> 27:26.076
about your family
and what's going on,

27:26.078 --> 27:29.146
I'm gonna have her
describe her walk for us.

27:29.148 --> 27:34.551
Initially, when I got here,
I encountered a female

27:34.553 --> 27:38.555
and her situation is
that she was murdered.

27:38.557 --> 27:43.627
She is pretty consumed
with the way that she died.

27:43.629 --> 27:47.865
I connected with her
in the bedroom on the right.

27:47.867 --> 27:49.400
All right,
so that's Chelsea's room.

27:49.402 --> 27:50.601
That's the youngest
daughter.

27:50.603 --> 27:51.869
Okay.

27:51.871 --> 27:55.439
And I got her specifically
trying to make contact

27:55.441 --> 27:58.042
with the individual
in that room.

27:58.044 --> 28:01.078
One of the ways she's
trying to make contact is

28:01.080 --> 28:03.013
through the living
person's dreams.

28:03.015 --> 28:08.619
The other thing is she tries
to get physical.

28:08.621 --> 28:11.522
One of the things she was
showing me doing was

28:11.524 --> 28:15.426
smacking the person on the bed,
trying to wake them up.

28:15.428 --> 28:19.163
She also tries
to talk to the person

28:19.165 --> 28:22.099
and is constantly
whispering and yelling,

28:22.101 --> 28:24.802
"Help me. Help me. Help me."

28:24.804 --> 28:26.870
Chelsea's
so scared to death

28:26.872 --> 28:28.772
of being in that room alone

28:28.774 --> 28:31.442
that she sleeps with me
every night.

28:31.444 --> 28:34.812
She's also heard someone say --
I can't remember if it was --

28:34.814 --> 28:37.414
- "Hey." "Hey."
- "Hey"? Or "Hello" or something.

28:37.416 --> 28:39.683
Now, she can get physical,
you were saying, right?

28:39.685 --> 28:40.984
Yes.

28:40.986 --> 28:43.987
So I have a picture here
of Chelsea's leg

28:43.989 --> 28:47.391
and the bruises
she wakes up with.

28:47.393 --> 28:51.161
Yeah. She'll go to sleep
and there's nothing there.

28:51.163 --> 28:54.998
and then, she wakes up and
there's bruises all over her.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.768
Denise, tell Amy about
the nightmare she has.

28:57.770 --> 29:00.204
She's been having
a recurring dream

29:00.206 --> 29:02.206
of a murder of a family

29:02.208 --> 29:06.210
and she sees this murder
over and over and over.

29:06.212 --> 29:08.278
Interesting. Okay.

29:08.280 --> 29:12.983
If people are coming
to her for help,

29:12.985 --> 29:15.419
then she's most likely
a physical medium.

29:17.757 --> 29:20.023
She probably has a <i> lot</i>
more people that show up,

29:20.025 --> 29:22.192
that she's not aware of.

29:22.194 --> 29:23.393
My god.

29:23.395 --> 29:25.162
So this murdered girl
who comes to Chelsea,

29:25.164 --> 29:27.097
did you get anything
on her in life?

29:27.099 --> 29:30.701
She looked young,
between 25 and 35.

29:30.703 --> 29:33.270
I got that her name
was Linda or Lily.

29:33.272 --> 29:35.739
I saw her getting into a fight
with her boyfriend.

29:35.741 --> 29:40.310
Then, two men grabbed her,
threw her in a car,

29:40.312 --> 29:42.146
and they beat her

29:42.148 --> 29:44.948
and they also
sexually assaulted her.

29:44.950 --> 29:46.150
They had a knife.

29:46.152 --> 29:49.987
They cut open her stomach,
slit her throat.

29:49.989 --> 29:51.622
And then, they took her body

29:51.624 --> 29:54.858
and they scattered it
all over the place.

29:54.860 --> 29:57.394
This is a tiny town.
There's not that many murders.

29:57.396 --> 29:59.797
They have one murder
that sounds similar.

29:59.799 --> 30:01.832
Almost 50 years ago,
a young woman was murdered

30:01.834 --> 30:03.834
only a couple miles from here.

30:03.836 --> 30:05.769
You said her name
was Linda or Lily?

30:05.771 --> 30:07.704
Well, the victim in this case,

30:07.706 --> 30:09.373
her name was
Linda Jane Phillips

30:09.375 --> 30:11.175
and she was 26 years old.

30:11.177 --> 30:13.377
Her parents live
right down the road from here.

30:13.379 --> 30:15.813
So, on August 8, 1970,

30:15.815 --> 30:18.248
Linda went to a wedding
party in Dallas.

30:18.250 --> 30:19.950
10:30 that night,
she called her parents,

30:19.952 --> 30:22.386
said she was gonna spend
the night at a friend's house.

30:22.388 --> 30:24.454
Linda never made it.

30:24.456 --> 30:26.190
A day later,
they found her body,

30:26.192 --> 30:28.392
totally stripped naked.

30:28.394 --> 30:32.296
She had been sexually assaulted
and stabbed 26 times.

30:32.298 --> 30:34.198
Now, I got
her death certificate.

30:34.200 --> 30:37.467
You talked about the stomach?

30:37.469 --> 30:41.872
She was stabbed
in the neck and abdomen.

30:41.874 --> 30:45.042
The sheriff I talked to
gave me Linda's picture.

30:45.044 --> 30:48.412
Now, do you think that's
who you might have seen?

30:48.414 --> 30:49.513
Yes.

30:54.386 --> 30:58.822
The other thing I saw
was an elderly male.

30:58.824 --> 31:01.058
He's active in both houses.

31:01.060 --> 31:04.862
I called him the lurker
because he's always behind you.

31:04.864 --> 31:07.397
Like you're always feeling
someone's right there

31:07.399 --> 31:09.299
and they're watching you.

31:09.301 --> 31:12.703
He doesn't particularly
care to be seen,

31:12.705 --> 31:16.273
but if he is,
it's more like a black shadow.

31:16.275 --> 31:20.344
The most concerning things
is that he seemed to be attached

31:20.346 --> 31:24.548
to someone
in the master bedroom

31:24.550 --> 31:27.251
and it's almost like
he's obsessed.

31:27.253 --> 31:29.953
And I saw him like sitting
on the side of the bed

31:29.955 --> 31:35.759
and like just really lightly
caressing the person's face.

31:35.761 --> 31:39.529
Chelsea has seen that.

31:39.531 --> 31:41.632
She has woke up
and she has told me.

31:41.634 --> 31:42.866
One night, she said,

31:42.868 --> 31:46.403
"Mom, I saw someone
at the end of our bed"

31:46.405 --> 31:48.572
and she said,
"I pretended to be asleep

31:48.574 --> 31:51.975
because I did not want
to move."

31:51.977 --> 31:54.511
Larry, you've seen
shadow figures as well.

31:54.513 --> 31:56.713
The shadow figures
that I've seen is

31:56.715 --> 31:59.616
more dark than translucent,

31:59.618 --> 32:01.885
where you couldn't
hardly see through it.

32:01.887 --> 32:04.121
Now, you said this guy

32:04.123 --> 32:06.623
likes to touch
inappropriately?

32:06.625 --> 32:09.927
Brittany, I want you to tell the
story about your sister Ashley.

32:09.929 --> 32:13.230
Yeah. She was
asleep in her bed.

32:13.232 --> 32:16.033
She had long
pajama pants on

32:16.035 --> 32:18.168
and she woke up

32:18.170 --> 32:19.770
and they were off of her

32:19.772 --> 32:22.205
and she has no clue
how they came off of her.

32:22.207 --> 32:24.474
Okay.
- When I spoke to her,

32:24.476 --> 32:25.976
she broke down,
talking about it.

32:25.978 --> 32:27.844
Now, is that this guy,
doing all this?

32:27.846 --> 32:30.447
Yeah.
He would be the one.

32:30.449 --> 32:33.116
He's being a little bit more
inappropriate than I thought.

32:37.556 --> 32:39.790
Anything else?

32:39.792 --> 32:43.060
I encountered
another deceased male.

32:43.062 --> 32:45.562
I got that he did die
far away.

32:45.564 --> 32:49.299
I got that he died
between 1990 and now.

32:49.301 --> 32:51.335
I got that there was
a deep family connection

32:51.337 --> 32:54.171
to a living person
in this house

32:54.173 --> 32:56.139
and it felt like there was
kind of a cord,

32:56.141 --> 32:59.142
an energetic cord,
that was wrapped around him.

32:59.144 --> 33:02.646
So he's being dragged
back in unwillingly.

33:02.648 --> 33:04.147
This means that
a living person here

33:04.149 --> 33:06.216
is inadvertently trapping him

33:06.218 --> 33:09.987
and they can't really let go
of him emotionally.

33:09.989 --> 33:11.655
So we're talking about
a dead man with a connection

33:11.657 --> 33:14.958
to a living person here,
died around 1990?

33:14.960 --> 33:16.994
Yes.
- I hate to even bring this up,

33:16.996 --> 33:19.763
but --
- My stepdad was murdered.

33:19.765 --> 33:21.665
I mean, have you gotten

33:21.667 --> 33:23.333
over it?

33:23.335 --> 33:25.402
I've moved on, but,

33:25.404 --> 33:27.771
they've never caught
his murderer, so,

33:27.773 --> 33:30.273
it's been kinda hard.

33:48.594 --> 33:52.696
I was afraid
this was gonna come up.

33:52.698 --> 33:55.632
I think it's a really
difficult situation to be in

33:55.634 --> 34:02.072
because you have an open murder
and you want justice for them

34:02.074 --> 34:05.542
and that's something that,
unfortunately,

34:05.544 --> 34:10.380
can sometimes keep them
kind of earthbound.

34:10.382 --> 34:12.349
So how do I let him go?

34:12.351 --> 34:14.083
Because I wouldn't
wish that for him.

34:18.322 --> 34:21.525
So the thing I'm most concerned
about was the bedroom

34:21.527 --> 34:24.127
at the end of the hall.
It was really bad.

34:24.129 --> 34:26.129
I was only in there
for a few minutes.

34:26.130 --> 34:27.496
One of
the interesting things

34:27.498 --> 34:30.567
was that the dead
even refused to go in there.

34:30.569 --> 34:33.070
That's Brittany's room.

34:33.072 --> 34:36.239
It was physically painful.

34:36.241 --> 34:38.875
Like pain in my ears,

34:38.877 --> 34:42.012
head, headaches,
stomach, nausea.

34:42.014 --> 34:43.547
She's always
had stomach problems.

34:43.549 --> 34:46.083
I've always had nausea.

34:46.085 --> 34:51.655
I also got depression in there,
a <i> lot</i> of sadness.

34:51.657 --> 34:54.391
And the other thing I got
is that, when you're in there,

34:54.393 --> 34:56.693
your brain is like
fully activated.

34:56.695 --> 34:59.396
Like it's going 100 miles
a **** hour.

34:59.398 --> 35:02.666
And, honestly, like
I couldn't even think straight.

35:02.668 --> 35:05.969
I go through that
every single night.

35:05.971 --> 35:07.838
I think about
everything and nothing

35:07.840 --> 35:09.573
at the same time.

35:09.575 --> 35:12.375
All this negative energy
has collected on the walls

35:12.377 --> 35:17.013
of your room and formed
into this black goop.

35:17.015 --> 35:20.450
And then, I saw it kind of
spilling out of that room

35:20.452 --> 35:23.253
and going through the house.

35:23.255 --> 35:27.824
This negative energy is coming
from a psychic empath.

35:27.826 --> 35:30.560
So you're the psychic empath.

35:30.562 --> 35:37.167
Everything that you feel, like
your emotions and stuff, you...

35:37.169 --> 35:40.270
are having a hard time
keeping within you.

35:40.272 --> 35:45.442
It's something that spills out
from you energetically.

35:45.444 --> 35:51.248
It can create negative thoughts
and negative thought patterns

35:51.250 --> 35:55.252
and it can cause
irrational behavior.

35:55.254 --> 35:57.854
Well, talking about
irrational behavior,

35:57.856 --> 36:02.626
I mean, he did get his leg
broke by your daughter

36:02.628 --> 36:03.827
Ashley.

36:03.829 --> 36:07.063
He did. Yes.

36:07.065 --> 36:09.833
He was talking to her
and she didn't wanna hear

36:09.835 --> 36:12.135
what he had to say
about her fiancÃ©.

36:12.137 --> 36:14.037
- Okay.
- So she got up to leave

36:14.039 --> 36:17.440
and he pushed her down
and she fought back

36:17.442 --> 36:19.476
- Okay.
- and she broke his leg.

36:19.478 --> 36:20.877
Wow.

36:20.879 --> 36:23.313
It's like something
in this house

36:23.315 --> 36:26.883
is trying to drive
all the men

36:26.885 --> 36:28.451
out of the house,
so that they

36:28.453 --> 36:30.420
can have their way
with the women.

36:30.422 --> 36:33.690
And, you know,
me and Denise,

36:33.692 --> 36:37.861
something came between us
and drew us apart.

36:37.863 --> 36:39.829
Have you guys gone
for counseling?

36:39.831 --> 36:41.064
- We did, for --
- Yes, we did.

36:41.066 --> 36:42.265
- You did?
- We did, three times, and --

36:42.267 --> 36:44.868
Three times?
Just three sessions?

36:44.870 --> 36:46.136
- Just three sessions.
- Yes, three sessions.

36:46.138 --> 36:48.438
What really made me quit

36:48.440 --> 36:51.641
doing counseling was because
Larry had told me that,

36:51.643 --> 36:53.910
regardless of what
I was gonna do, basically,

36:53.912 --> 36:56.379
he was gonna keep on drinking
and I just knew.

36:56.381 --> 37:02.919
I was like "I'm done."
26 years, down the tubes.

37:02.921 --> 37:07.257
You are killing yourself,
plain and simple.

37:07.259 --> 37:08.792
Your drinking
broke up the marriage

37:08.794 --> 37:12.729
because she loves you
and she doesn't want you to die!

37:12.731 --> 37:14.064
So, you need
to get help for that,

37:14.066 --> 37:15.832
if you want your family back.

37:19.938 --> 37:22.305
I mean, you worry about him.
Don't you?

37:22.307 --> 37:23.373
Every day.

37:27.946 --> 37:30.113
Man the **** up
and knock it **** off.

37:30.115 --> 37:32.249
It's that simple.

37:32.251 --> 37:35.885
The key is stop drinking,
take care of yourself,

37:35.887 --> 37:38.154
because these people love you

37:38.156 --> 37:40.991
and they don't want you
to be dead.

37:40.993 --> 37:43.593
Is this black goop making
Larry's condition worse?

37:43.595 --> 37:45.929
Yes.

37:45.931 --> 37:49.266
Now, this gelatin thing
you described,

37:49.268 --> 37:52.636
does it look that way
to you, or to everybody?

37:52.638 --> 37:54.104
I had a sketch done of it.

38:08.453 --> 38:10.553
My god.

38:10.555 --> 38:13.323
You don't see it that way,
but you feel that way?

38:18.563 --> 38:20.297
What exactly
is this thing?

38:20.299 --> 38:21.798
It's emotions.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.133
Her emotions?

38:23.135 --> 38:25.702
Well, she collects emotions.
- So she's absorbing

38:25.704 --> 38:28.905
everybody else's ****,
all their energy,

38:28.907 --> 38:30.473
and it's led to this stuff
spilling out

38:30.475 --> 38:31.741
all over the house?

38:31.743 --> 38:33.376
Yes.

38:33.378 --> 38:37.080
Aw, honey. It's okay.

38:57.336 --> 38:58.902
So, Larry, you called us in
because you thought

38:58.904 --> 39:00.470
the paranormal
broke up your marriage.

39:00.472 --> 39:01.871
Well,
that's not the case.

39:01.873 --> 39:04.007
But, turns out, it's a good
thing you did call us

39:04.009 --> 39:06.843
'cause your kids are
under attack.

39:06.845 --> 39:08.378
Now, to find out
what you can do about it,

39:08.380 --> 39:10.714
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

39:10.716 --> 39:14.751
There's family issues and then,
there's paranormal issues,

39:14.753 --> 39:18.521
which do go hand-in-hand,
oftentimes.

39:18.523 --> 39:20.790
There are dead that are attached
to this location,

39:20.792 --> 39:22.792
for one reason or another

39:22.794 --> 39:26.496
and for them, let's go ahead
and move them on.

39:26.498 --> 39:29.065
What I would like to see
happen is a medium come out

39:29.067 --> 39:30.800
to move on the dead

39:30.802 --> 39:34.237
that are attached
to this specific location.

39:34.239 --> 39:35.939
What about
Denise's stepdad?

39:35.941 --> 39:39.275
What I would like to see is
you have a medium reading

39:39.277 --> 39:41.378
just for him.
- Okay.

39:41.380 --> 39:44.981
The second thing is
for Brittany.

39:44.983 --> 39:47.884
To prevent any more
of that stuff from forming

39:47.886 --> 39:50.954
around you or in your
physical environment,

39:50.956 --> 39:54.090
start journaling
every single night.

39:54.092 --> 39:56.359
Well, the other thing is

39:56.361 --> 39:59.129
for you to put these
in your bath.

39:59.131 --> 40:02.399
It's a mixture of herbs
and crystals

40:02.401 --> 40:07.404
and this is going to cleanse
away negative emotions,

40:07.406 --> 40:10.673
the stuff that's accumulated.

40:10.675 --> 40:14.511
So, for Chelsea,
at least one time a week,

40:14.513 --> 40:18.415
she <i> has</i> to let the dead
come through, has to.

40:18.417 --> 40:21.518
It's not fun, but, the dead
need to have access to her.

40:21.520 --> 40:24.387
She's a medium and so,
she's gonna learn

40:24.389 --> 40:26.589
setting appropriate
boundaries with them.

40:26.591 --> 40:30.026
But if she doesn't do the once-
a- week thing with the dead,

40:30.028 --> 40:35.899
they'll slam her,
and they'll slam her <i> hard.</i>

40:35.901 --> 40:38.468
The last thing
that I wanted to say:

40:38.470 --> 40:40.937
I would like the entire family

40:40.939 --> 40:43.573
to go for family counseling.

40:43.575 --> 40:45.742
Ev-er-y-one.

40:45.744 --> 40:49.345
This is <i> extremely</i> important.

40:49.347 --> 40:52.916
I think it'll lead you
on a very interesting path.

40:52.918 --> 40:55.185
So, Larry,
I know you wanted us

40:55.187 --> 40:58.488
to try to help your marriage,
with that, but,

40:58.490 --> 41:00.590
we did help
your daughters out.

41:00.592 --> 41:01.925
I mean, I can't blame
everything

41:01.927 --> 41:03.226
on everybody else.

41:03.228 --> 41:06.930
I gotta look at myself,
too, you know.

41:06.932 --> 41:08.932
Did we ever get more
than I thought we would get.

41:08.934 --> 41:12.402
We were just hoping
to not be crazy.

41:12.404 --> 41:14.404
It's overwhelming,

41:14.406 --> 41:16.873
but, at the same time,
I'm relieved.

41:19.878 --> 41:21.478
The dead are causing
a lot of issues

41:21.480 --> 41:22.946
for Larry and his family,

41:22.948 --> 41:27.250
but I believe their problems go
much deeper than the paranormal.

41:27.252 --> 41:29.953
With the help of a medium,
the dead will be set free

41:29.955 --> 41:31.321
and, with the help
of counseling,

41:31.323 --> 41:33.423
so will the living,
as this dark,

41:33.425 --> 41:35.592
negative goop
will begin to dissipate.
