Previously on "Rescue Me..."

00:01.936 --> 00:02.735
Can you move back?

00:02.804 --> 00:04.275
I'm guessing she wasn't
the designated driver.

00:06.025 --> 00:07.574
Her neck is broken, Tom.

00:08.379 --> 00:11.242
She reminds you of your daughter.
I get it, OK, Tommy?

00:11.362 --> 00:13.013
But this is here and this is now.

00:13.081 --> 00:14.874
- I can't get up.
- Chicken shit.

00:14.994 --> 00:16.158
So what's the deal with your uncle?

00:16.279 --> 00:17.165
I think he's scared.

00:17.285 --> 00:18.399
I think we're all scared.

00:18.436 --> 00:21.044
The Mayor's going to have to
close a couple of firehouses.

00:21.164 --> 00:23.423
This house is number one on the list.

00:23.491 --> 00:26.305
We are having a huge cookout,
and everybody is coming in.

00:26.425 --> 00:28.609
We're going to stuff them all
full of free food.

00:28.729 --> 00:31.779
It's great public relations.
Even Feinberg is gotta get behind us.

00:31.899 --> 00:36.925
God decides you get another chance,
and this is what you do with it?

00:39.350 --> 00:41.962
- What are you doing?!
- Jesus Christ.

00:42.082 --> 00:45.701
How many times did I tell you
not to ride your goddamn bike...

00:45.745 --> 00:49.049
I just wanted to show you my wheelie.
Mom said it was cool!

00:49.117 --> 00:51.118
Mom this, mom that!

00:51.711 --> 00:52.689
Is he out?

00:52.809 --> 00:53.932
Yes, he's out.

00:54.222 --> 00:56.834
You're the one trying to get with
my man's wife behind his back.

00:56.954 --> 00:58.758
How about your drunk ass girlfriend?
How come you ain't keeping

00:58.826 --> 00:59.693
that pussy in line?

Dad! Oh! Dad!

01:03.764 --> 01:05.465
What are you doing?!

01:05.533 --> 01:06.845
- Dad!
- Listen to me.

01:07.401 --> 01:08.668
Do you resist Satan?

01:08.736 --> 01:10.212
Go to hell!

01:11.176 --> 01:12.639
Let her up. Let her up.

02:07.322 --> 02:08.495
I went batshit.

02:09.537 --> 02:13.881
I don't... I don't... None of that stuff
I said, I don't feel that way,

02:14.405 --> 02:15.802
obviously.

02:16.347 --> 02:20.173
There's not a day that goes by
that I don't wish

02:20.241 --> 02:22.037
that I could fix things.

02:22.889 --> 02:29.327
I wish I could hold you and
talk to you and do stuff.

02:31.461 --> 02:32.634
I love you.

02:37.966 --> 02:39.092
Let's go.

02:40.073 --> 02:41.895
We're dropping the charges.

02:41.963 --> 02:44.556
I love you, too.

02:45.241 --> 02:46.484
Big daddy.

02:47.211 --> 02:48.915
Nice to know you two connected.

02:58.395 --> 02:59.722
Ok.

03:00.114 --> 03:05.367
So, uh, Shawn has Wyatt and
Katie over at his house.

03:05.487 --> 03:08.455
Yeah. We didn't know how long
the process would take, so...

03:08.786 --> 03:10.602
Right. Ooh.

03:12.805 --> 03:13.893
You good?

03:14.959 --> 03:16.196
Yeah, I'm just great.

03:16.264 --> 03:17.897
No, I mean drinking-wise.

03:17.965 --> 03:21.501
You, uh, you lose the taste for it?

03:21.569 --> 03:25.972
I don't know. I might have lost the
taste for it after what happened.

03:26.040 --> 03:27.285
Might have, or did?

03:27.775 --> 03:28.975
I don't know.

03:30.137 --> 03:31.077
All right.

03:31.145 --> 03:34.225
Well, let's find out.

03:39.342 --> 03:40.487
What are you doing?

03:42.551 --> 03:45.414
- I'm giving her a little sample...
- Tommy!

03:45.534 --> 03:47.193
From her stash.

03:48.003 --> 03:49.429
Go ahead, drink that.

03:51.198 --> 03:52.037
I don't want it.

03:52.366 --> 03:53.433
I know you don't want to.

03:53.501 --> 03:54.914
I want you to. Go ahead.

03:59.597 --> 04:00.668
Ugh, I can't.

04:00.720 --> 04:03.925
Either you can on your own, or I will
force it down your goddamn throat.

04:03.984 --> 04:06.046
- Go ahead...
- Jesus Christ!

04:06.113 --> 04:08.060
Just hang on. Go ahead.

04:12.486 --> 04:13.692
Oh!

04:14.090 --> 04:15.249
Are you happy?

04:16.827 --> 04:18.572
- Not yet.
- Oh!

04:20.297 --> 04:22.262
Ok. Here, sweetheart.

04:22.330 --> 04:23.530
You OK?

04:23.597 --> 04:24.631
Yeah.

04:24.699 --> 04:25.730
Yeah?

04:27.597 --> 04:28.868
One more try.

04:28.936 --> 04:30.136
Are you insane?

04:30.408 --> 04:31.604
Yes. I'm insane.

God.

04:34.556 --> 04:35.730

Well, well, well.

04:50.679 --> 04:55.137
I guess it was just the...

04:59.346 --> 05:02.355
- Wow. - Wow.
- Yeah.

05:04.437 --> 05:08.251
May be madness in my method, but
you can't argue with my results.

05:08.371 --> 05:11.544
Ok, that thing that you
just did, that move,

05:11.612 --> 05:12.812
where did you pull that from?

05:12.880 --> 05:15.923
Uh, out of my ass, basically.

05:16.189 --> 05:19.426
You know, you always hear these
people talk about tough love.

05:20.362 --> 05:24.631
I just figured, why not
take a chance, you know?

05:24.751 --> 05:25.651
Oh.

05:26.573 --> 05:28.250
You may have just saved our daughter.

05:29.226 --> 05:30.330
Yeah.

05:30.398 --> 05:31.331
Yeah.

05:34.466 --> 05:37.805
- Hey, do you want to, um...
- Yeah.

You don't even know
what I'm going to ask.

05:40.341 --> 05:42.029
You were about to ask
me out for dinner.

05:44.344 --> 05:45.211
Yeah.

05:46.551 --> 05:48.581
Talk about radar, Jesus.

05:50.202 --> 05:51.753
- Do you want to, uh...
- Yeah.

05:53.912 --> 05:54.932
Tonight?

05:55.052 --> 05:57.419
Might as well strike while
the iron's hot, right?

I'm going to try some wine.

Rough couple of days.

07:11.710 --> 07:14.825
But hey, you cured Colleen, you know?

07:14.945 --> 07:17.807
That shit makes my load a hell of a lot
easier, that's for sure.

Listen, she told me you tuned
Franco up pretty good. So...

07:33.084 --> 07:34.397
I was motivated.

07:34.858 --> 07:38.647
Yeah, but I know you were covering my ass.
Don't think I don't appreciate it. Thanks.

No, look, Tommy, don't thank me.

07:40.513 --> 07:43.740
You know, I feel lousy
about the whole incident.

07:43.860 --> 07:46.088
Why? You did what
needed to be done.

was not acting right.

And, yeah, he spoke out of turn,
but that doesn't excuse me

07:53.178 --> 07:54.978
for putting my hands on him
the way I did. I mean,

07:54.989 --> 07:56.479
you just don't do family
like that, you know?

07:57.007 --> 07:57.800
Yes, you do.

07:58.099 --> 08:00.325
No, you don't, Tommy.
You don't.

08:00.347 --> 08:02.900
Let me explain something to you, OK?
I come from a big Irish family.

08:03.020 --> 08:05.482
And I am telling you, when my brothers
and I were growing up,

08:05.602 --> 08:08.477
if somebody stepped out of line,
it was your responsibility

08:08.517 --> 08:11.113
to grab the son of a bitch and slap
some sense into him. You know what I mean?

08:11.181 --> 08:13.382
Knock 'em down, maybe kick him
while he's down and then

08:13.450 --> 08:17.852
stand him back up again. I mean,
that's what family is for, you know?

08:17.898 --> 08:20.100
That's what being
a brother is all about.

08:20.140 --> 08:24.090
It's because you love the
guy and, you know, that's...

08:24.663 --> 08:25.780
You're taking care of him.

08:25.900 --> 08:29.694
It's, you know...
You did the right thing.

08:32.328 --> 08:38.643
That was probably the most truly wise
thing you've ever said to me.

08:38.692 --> 08:41.296
I mean, it involved beating
the shit out of somebody, but...

08:42.456 --> 08:43.462
It was wise.

08:43.582 --> 08:47.991
I'm wise in very, uh,
specific areas, I guess.

08:48.536 --> 08:49.821
So what do I do now, man?

08:51.570 --> 08:58.917
You know, you go, um, you, uh, walk
up to 'em and you act friendly.

08:59.298 --> 09:03.054
And by that behavior you're offering
an olive branch, you know?

09:03.368 --> 09:04.873
You know? And then, you know,

09:05.306 --> 09:09.285
let things happen as they will,
and if it feels organic, you apologize.

09:10.138 --> 09:11.306
Organic?

09:12.234 --> 09:13.108
Did I say organic?

09:13.176 --> 09:16.712
Sure as shit wasn't me saying it.
What, you grow a vajayjay overnight?

09:16.779 --> 09:19.948

Yeah.

09:35.465 --> 09:38.567
Hey, by the way, one little
pearl of Irish family wisdom?

09:39.804 --> 09:43.305
I wouldn't turn my back on Franco
for at least a couple of days.

09:43.373 --> 09:44.806
Shit.

09:51.859 --> 09:53.926
- Yo, what the hell is going on?
- Hey.

09:54.046 --> 09:55.397
Bastards shut us down.

09:55.432 --> 09:56.652
- They closed the house.
- What?

09:56.772 --> 09:58.830
All your bullshit finally
caught up to us.

09:59.155 --> 10:00.615
Like bailing on a call.

10:00.735 --> 10:03.058
And getting arrested for
assaulting your own daughter.

10:03.126 --> 10:04.226
In a church!

10:04.346 --> 10:06.395
Hey, that wasn't assault,
that was a sacrament.

10:06.462 --> 10:07.429
There's a fine line.

10:07.497 --> 10:09.731
Oh, really? You want to blame
somebody, why don't you take

10:09.799 --> 10:10.866
a look at your own ass, huh?

10:10.934 --> 10:13.068
You were the officer in charge
when black Shawn

10:13.136 --> 10:14.836
went Larry Holmes on Franco, huh?

10:14.904 --> 10:16.310
And Lou is beating up the cops.

10:16.358 --> 10:17.885
Whoa, now you're throwing
me under the bus?

10:17.914 --> 10:21.610
Hey, all I'm saying is, this bus is big
enough for all of us to get under, OK?

10:21.887 --> 10:22.921
Might have been the email.

10:23.041 --> 10:25.447
- Shut up!
- What email?

10:26.765 --> 10:28.450
We sent an email.

10:28.518 --> 10:29.718
I didn't know you could type.

10:29.786 --> 10:31.020
I didn't know you
shitheads could spell.

10:31.140 --> 10:32.012
What was the email about?

10:32.064 --> 10:33.128
- About Pat.
- Mahoney.

10:33.168 --> 10:35.724
That we didn't feel like that
anyone was paying enough attention

10:35.792 --> 10:37.693
to the fact that he had cancer
and didn't even have enough money

10:37.760 --> 10:40.896
for treatment, so
we wrote headquarters this email.

10:40.964 --> 10:41.597
Oh, boy.

10:41.664 --> 10:44.266
Yeah, I mean, once we got into the writing
of it, it just spun out of control.

10:44.334 --> 10:46.168
All of a sudden, we were like,
holy shit, this is really bad.

10:46.236 --> 10:47.135
Really bad.

10:47.203 --> 10:50.826
- Anyway, the kicker is, I went to
hit delete and I hit... - Send.

10:50.946 --> 10:52.975
Yeah, sorry.
It was an accident!

10:53.042 --> 10:54.503
- Hey.
- What's going on?

10:54.623 --> 10:55.732
What happened to the cookout?

10:55.852 --> 10:57.112
Headquarters shut us down.

10:57.180 --> 10:58.380
Bullshit!

10:58.747 --> 11:00.326
The whole hood was coming out.

11:00.446 --> 11:01.783
You got hungry people up here, son.

11:01.851 --> 11:03.719
Look, sweetheart, it came
down from the mountain.

11:03.786 --> 11:05.154
There's nothing we can do about it.

11:05.274 --> 11:07.054
Well, then who's going
to put out the fires?

11:07.390 --> 11:09.424
I guess they're gonna have to get the
West Side Wild men to do that now.

11:09.675 --> 11:10.959
Well, that's some bullshit.

11:11.379 --> 11:13.528
Nobody cares how long it'll take
'em to get here, 'cause it's

11:13.596 --> 11:15.830
just goddamn black folk burning all up.

11:15.950 --> 11:19.225
- Hey, mam. Don't ***.
- Well this ain't happening without some noise.

11:20.905 --> 11:22.427
- We could use some noise.
- Yeah, noise would be great.

11:22.547 --> 11:23.536
I mean, not gunfire.

11:23.571 --> 11:24.773
No, no, no gunfire.

11:24.841 --> 11:25.974
Firebombing.

11:26.042 --> 11:27.075
You've done enough.

11:27.143 --> 11:28.176
Chanting.

11:28.244 --> 11:29.893
- Chanting. Chanting's good.
- Chanting?

11:29.928 --> 11:32.551
Yeah, like, "Hell, no, we won't
go," that kind of thing.

11:32.566 --> 11:34.950
Or, "kiss my big black ass, Mr. Mayor."

11:35.018 --> 11:37.075
You mean your big, black,
moisturized ass?

11:37.341 --> 11:38.186
Stop it.

11:38.254 --> 11:39.748
Look, sweetheart, chanting is great.

11:39.868 --> 11:42.758
And if you want to protest on our behalf,
who are we to stop you?

11:43.317 --> 11:45.193
The only thing black people
like more than a cookout

11:45.261 --> 11:46.722
is a good, old-fashioned protest.

11:47.462 --> 11:50.067
D., Brandon, get over here,
we're gonna have us a protest.

11:50.187 --> 11:52.167
Guys, let's make a little noise.
Come on.

11:52.235 --> 11:54.469
Yeah, you're right, come
on, come on, let's do it!

11:54.537 --> 11:55.370
Out of my way!

11:55.438 --> 11:56.438
Whoa, Lou!

11:56.506 --> 11:58.012
Whoa, whoa!

11:58.132 --> 11:59.141
Lou!

11:59.208 --> 12:01.870
Come on, Lou! Jesus.
Come on, Lou.

12:05.258 --> 12:06.626
Well, you see where I
was going with that.

12:06.649 --> 12:07.919
Why isn't the press here?

12:08.518 --> 12:10.663
Yeah, I mean, this kind of
stuff's all over the news.

12:10.783 --> 12:12.020
It is on the news.

12:12.351 --> 12:13.971
17 houses got shut down.

12:14.091 --> 12:15.536
The press is spread as thin as we are.

12:15.586 --> 12:16.586
17 houses?

12:16.607 --> 12:19.389
Every burrow got hit, the
Bronx, the worst. Six. Gone.

12:19.653 --> 12:20.910
I'm gonna go grab my scanner.

12:21.030 --> 12:22.537
Fire dispatch must be going nuts.

12:22.657 --> 12:25.186
I'm gonna go make some phone calls,
see if I can get us some coverage on this.

12:25.306 --> 12:26.702
We gotta get into this building.

12:26.769 --> 12:27.769
Aw, man.

12:27.837 --> 12:30.331
Lou, there's nothing in there. They took
the trucks, they took the equipment.

12:30.451 --> 12:31.857
Don't tell me that there's
nothing in there.

12:31.977 --> 12:33.156
I got all my food in there.

12:33.203 --> 12:34.910
Yeah, Lou, it's city property.

12:34.977 --> 12:36.470
The kid's got a point.
You know?

12:36.590 --> 12:39.180
You know, I was here late
last night making my homemade

12:39.300 --> 12:41.792
chocolate cupcakes, the ones
with the peanut butter frosting.

12:41.912 --> 12:42.851
Ooh.

12:42.919 --> 12:45.157
Are you talking about the ones
with the frosting on the top?

12:45.277 --> 12:46.121
Yes.

12:46.189 --> 12:48.457
And the extra frosting on the inside?

12:48.524 --> 12:49.324
Yes.

12:49.392 --> 12:54.062
So when you bite in... yes, when you bite
into it...You get the stuff on the inside.

12:54.130 --> 12:55.330
Let's go!

12:55.398 --> 12:57.933
On three, on three!

12:58.167 --> 13:03.535
Save our firehouse, save our
firehouse, save our firehouse,

13:03.655 --> 13:06.257
save our firehouse,
save our firehouse!

13:06.325 --> 13:07.992
Come on, y'all, come on, come on!

13:08.060 --> 13:08.926
"Eat shit, Mayor."

13:09.534 --> 13:11.937
It lacks poetry but it
gets the point across.

13:12.057 --> 13:13.767
Damn, they came out of the woodworks.

13:13.887 --> 13:15.433
I can't believe there's no news here.

13:15.501 --> 13:16.960
No sign of Franco, either.

13:17.080 --> 13:18.302
Yeah, he probably heard about
the closing, stayed home

13:18.370 --> 13:19.498
to lick his wounds.

13:19.618 --> 13:21.339
Or he's out buying the
largest gun he can find

13:21.406 --> 13:23.189
to fill you full of lead.

13:23.859 --> 13:27.269
You know, I think I'm gonna go with the idea
that he's at home licking his wounds.

13:27.389 --> 13:29.117
- Good call.
- Yeah.

13:29.237 --> 13:30.481
This was a good idea, right?

13:30.549 --> 13:32.233
It's like a million man march out here.

13:32.289 --> 13:32.918
Yeah, OK.

13:33.628 --> 13:35.385
All right, I'll talk to you later.
Bye.

13:35.907 --> 13:39.557
Hey. Penny says they're getting flooded
with calls over on the West Side.

13:39.625 --> 13:40.725
I'm sure they are.

13:40.793 --> 13:42.527
I'll tell you where they're not
going to close a firehouse,

13:42.830 --> 13:44.353
where the Mayor lives.

13:44.590 --> 13:46.099
Guaranteed, his block.

13:46.219 --> 13:47.632
Open firehouse.

13:47.699 --> 13:49.934
So that's it? We're done?

13:50.002 --> 13:51.569
Great, and I just got started.

13:51.637 --> 13:53.104
No, it's no big thing.

13:53.172 --> 13:54.906
I'll make a couple calls and
make sure we get reassigned

13:54.973 --> 13:57.608
to a house together
that's busy like this.

13:57.676 --> 14:00.578
I think I still got a couple favors
somewhere downtown.

14:02.562 --> 14:03.447
What?

14:03.937 --> 14:04.915
Nothing.

14:05.902 --> 14:08.119
That wasn't your nothing face.
That was a something face.

14:08.187 --> 14:09.772
No, this is my regular face.

14:09.892 --> 14:11.096
That's not your regular face.

14:11.216 --> 14:13.907
I know all your faces. That's "I wanna say
something" and "I don't wanna say something".

14:14.027 --> 14:16.308
"I'm afraid I'm gonna yell" face.
What's going on?

14:16.428 --> 14:18.896
All right.

14:19.429 --> 14:20.631
Don't get me wrong, all right?

14:21.147 --> 14:22.200
You know, the job is great.

14:22.666 --> 14:24.735
- I feel like I'm getting pretty good at it.
- Uh-huh.

14:24.803 --> 14:27.657
But, I don't know, seeing you
the other day,

14:27.777 --> 14:30.462
- glued to your seat in the kitchen,
it was like...- Ok, listen.

14:30.480 --> 14:33.411
Ask any of the guys, never happened before,
never gonna happen again.

14:33.478 --> 14:34.545
It was a one-time thing.

14:34.613 --> 14:35.680
Ok, well, I'm just saying.

14:35.747 --> 14:38.308
You know, the impact that losing
that little girl had on you

14:38.428 --> 14:41.805
got me thinking, I don't know, do
I really want to go

14:41.839 --> 14:44.201
through that kind of disappointment
and heartache and pain

14:44.321 --> 14:45.323
day after day after day?

14:46.319 --> 14:49.475
Anger, heartache, yeah, whatever, agony,

14:49.595 --> 14:52.324
that's not just this. That's anything.

14:52.444 --> 14:53.664
Any place... it's life.

14:53.732 --> 14:54.799
It's called life, asshole.

14:54.867 --> 14:55.800
No, that's called your life.

14:55.868 --> 14:58.278
Maybe I don't want that kind of life.

14:58.398 --> 15:00.248
All the angst and drama and bullshit.

15:02.396 --> 15:05.693
Look, I know I got the brains
and the balls to do the job,

15:05.813 --> 15:08.543
all right? My old man, he'd be proud.
I know that.

15:08.663 --> 15:09.881
So mission accomplished.

15:10.516 --> 15:13.296
But now I got this great girl who likes me.

15:13.416 --> 15:15.119
And things have been pretty cool
with my mom.

15:15.187 --> 15:17.255
And now I'm just thinking,
maybe I can make just as big

15:17.322 --> 15:19.290
a difference in the world
doing something else.

15:19.358 --> 15:20.224
Yeah, what else?

15:20.292 --> 15:23.127
I don't know. Off the top of
my head,

15:23.195 --> 15:25.596
how about something that doesn't involve me
getting fried up in a fire?

15:26.643 --> 15:28.375
- Who have you been talking to?
- Nobody.

15:30.902 --> 15:32.984
- Penny.
- Uh-huh, Penny. Figured.

15:33.104 --> 15:34.227
Penny wants you to quit.

15:34.347 --> 15:36.774
No, Penny wants me to do
whatever makes me happy.

15:37.327 --> 15:39.977
Unlike you. You just want me
to do what you want me to do.

15:40.401 --> 15:42.280
Or what you think my dad would
want me to do, which is

15:42.347 --> 15:43.247
pretty much the same thing.

15:43.315 --> 15:46.018
And you know what, now I'm even more
sure that I don't want to do it.

15:47.130 --> 15:48.225
Fine with me.

15:49.221 --> 15:51.073
Yeah, you know what, you
want to treat me like a son?

15:51.193 --> 15:52.316
Try acting like a father.

15:52.568 --> 15:54.525
Back off, and let me
do what's best for me.

15:54.593 --> 15:55.510
You got it.

16:00.098 --> 16:01.432
Hey.

16:01.500 --> 16:02.700
Hey, how are you?

16:02.768 --> 16:04.775
Good, how are you?

16:07.500 --> 16:09.073
I swear, I had no idea.

16:09.141 --> 16:09.907
Shit.

16:09.975 --> 16:11.142
Seriously.

16:11.209 --> 16:13.344
It's bad enough you were
banging her after Jimmy died.

16:13.412 --> 16:17.041
I thought 2 family members in the
same crazy vagina was enough.

16:17.161 --> 16:19.183
Who the hell she think
she is, Marilyn Monroe?

16:19.732 --> 16:21.652
She's just doing this
to get inside my head.

16:22.017 --> 16:23.054
More like Damian's.

16:23.410 --> 16:25.389
She's got Mick in his ear
about quitting the job.

16:25.457 --> 16:28.005
I knew it. I knew it.

16:31.009 --> 16:32.611
This behavior is completely unacceptable.

16:34.094 --> 16:37.642
Oh, that's rich coming
from the guy who shot me.

16:37.762 --> 16:40.864
Desperate times, desperate measures.
I don't need to tell you.

16:40.984 --> 16:43.700
That booze baptismal
you gave Colleen?

16:43.820 --> 16:45.443
That was a stroke of genius.

16:45.755 --> 16:47.244
I thought I was extreme.

16:47.676 --> 16:50.288
You're like AA's very own Evel Knievel.

16:50.680 --> 16:52.917
Everyone's wondering when you're
gonna come to another meeting.

16:52.985 --> 16:54.651
We got a waitlist longer
than Harvard law.

16:54.771 --> 16:56.654
Wait a minute, you're telling
people at other meetings

16:56.722 --> 16:57.826
what I did at that meeting?

16:58.190 --> 17:00.802
Oh, yeah, they drink it
in like a case of Pabst!

17:00.922 --> 17:03.295
Just do me a favor, OK?
Stop bragging about that.

17:03.415 --> 17:05.223
It's not something I'm
particularly proud of.

17:05.343 --> 17:06.242
It works!

17:06.363 --> 17:09.640
I know it works, but it wasn't
pretty and it wasn't easy.

17:10.115 --> 17:12.435
Nothing worth doing ever is.

17:12.744 --> 17:13.838
Maybe so.

17:15.002 --> 17:16.674
I'm gonna go beat the shit
out of him right now.

17:16.742 --> 17:18.642
No, no, now hold on there, son.
If you go over there

17:18.710 --> 17:20.377
and start throwing haymakers,
you're gonna make the situation

17:20.444 --> 17:22.780
here worse. Just relax.

17:22.848 --> 17:24.615
You're right.

17:24.683 --> 17:25.522
Gentlemen.

17:25.788 --> 17:28.009
Hey. Father Phil, this
is my Uncle Teddy.

17:30.086 --> 17:31.223
The trigger man.

17:31.343 --> 17:33.911
Hey, I only shoot drunk
drivers and close family, father.

17:34.031 --> 17:37.319
So unless you decide to get hooched up
and get behind a wheel, you're safe.

17:37.439 --> 17:38.396
Good to know.

17:39.025 --> 17:39.797
How's Colleen?

17:39.865 --> 17:42.732
She's good. Takes a sip of
alcohol, like a minute later,

17:42.852 --> 17:44.368
she pukes her guts out.
It's great.

17:44.436 --> 17:45.536
Congratulations.

17:45.604 --> 17:46.704
An Irish bulimic.

17:46.772 --> 17:47.938
Yeah.

17:48.006 --> 17:50.641
He's a true renaissance man.

17:52.177 --> 17:53.183
Oh. Who's that?

17:53.700 --> 17:56.174
That's my asshole cousin,
the ex-priest,

17:56.294 --> 17:57.445
and that's the probie. You met the probie.

17:57.565 --> 17:58.996
No, no, no, I mean the dame.

17:59.116 --> 18:00.885
Oh. That's Sheila.

18:00.952 --> 18:02.753
Remember, I told you me
and her had that thing.

18:02.821 --> 18:04.677
And now she's sleeping
with your cousin?

18:05.023 --> 18:07.458
That's cold.
I definitely know the type.

18:07.526 --> 18:11.365
We don't know for certain if anybody's
sleeping with anybody. You know?

18:13.376 --> 18:14.396
What?

18:15.631 --> 18:19.103
There's some things I might not
know, Thomas,

18:19.171 --> 18:23.707
but one thing I know for certain,
that lady there? A total collar chaser.

18:23.989 --> 18:24.775
Really?

18:25.986 --> 18:26.844
What do you mean?

18:27.687 --> 18:29.419
What, do you think
firefighters, rock stars

18:29.539 --> 18:31.348
and ball players are the only
ones with groupies?

18:31.416 --> 18:35.469
There's a certain group of ladies,
they go gooey for a collar.

18:35.589 --> 18:36.307
Really?

18:36.329 --> 18:37.888
They hop in the sack with a
priest, and

18:37.956 --> 18:39.324
it's no-holds barred.

18:39.953 --> 18:41.461
Yeah, they can be as dirty as they want,

18:41.581 --> 18:43.375
and when it's all finished, they get total absolution

18:43.495 --> 18:46.308
for all the sick and twisted
things they did and said.

18:46.671 --> 18:47.901
It's one stop shop.

18:50.485 --> 18:51.840
Or so I've heard.

18:52.849 --> 18:54.009
You want to meet her?

18:55.294 --> 18:58.676
Does Jesus have a really lame beard?
Lead on, brother.

18:58.743 --> 18:59.749
Come on.

18:59.869 --> 19:00.657
Bye.

19:00.777 --> 19:02.146
Teddy, my collar straight?

19:02.214 --> 19:03.481
Darrell, put that brick down!

19:03.548 --> 19:04.858
Sorry about the house closing.

19:04.978 --> 19:05.924
- Yeah.
- Tough break.

19:06.044 --> 19:08.131
Father Phil, this is Sheila.

19:08.170 --> 19:09.293
Sheila, this is father Phil.

19:10.414 --> 19:12.292
When it rains, it pours.

19:12.656 --> 19:15.184
You're the most beautiful
woman I've ever laid eyes on.

19:17.745 --> 19:19.408
Mickey Gavin, how are you?

19:19.659 --> 19:21.432
Oh, where do you practice?

19:21.730 --> 19:22.892
Our lady of redemption.

19:22.893 --> 19:24.702
We have movie nights every Wednesday.

19:24.769 --> 19:26.500
We're showing "Grease" next week.
You should come by.

19:26.620 --> 19:27.771
Oh, God, "Grease"

19:27.839 --> 19:29.907
is just like my most
favortist movie ever.

19:29.975 --> 19:31.864
Everybody loves "Grease."

19:31.984 --> 19:33.077
I hate "Grease."

19:33.406 --> 19:34.496
Those guys are all fags.

19:34.980 --> 19:37.114
Well, I guess it's not for
everybody, I suppose.

19:37.182 --> 19:38.791
It's a little high-brow.

19:41.553 --> 19:42.887
City hall can go to hell!

19:42.954 --> 19:44.722
City hall can go to hell!

19:44.789 --> 19:46.699
City hall can go to hell!

19:46.819 --> 19:48.926
Hey, what the hell is going on here?

19:48.994 --> 19:49.894
We got shut down.

19:49.961 --> 19:51.662
I know that.
I'm talking about all of these people.

19:51.730 --> 19:54.624
It's a protest, which
they seem to enjoy doing.

19:54.744 --> 19:56.031
You encouraging all this shit?

19:56.151 --> 19:57.868
Well, I'm certainly not condemning it.

19:57.936 --> 19:59.637
So this is your reaction
to getting shut down, huh?

19:59.704 --> 20:01.372
It's only going to make matters worse.

20:01.439 --> 20:03.140
You want to be soft,
Feinberg, you be soft.

20:03.208 --> 20:04.141
But we're pissed off.

20:04.209 --> 20:05.674
These people are pissed off.

20:05.794 --> 20:07.723
And we got a right to let the
people in charge know it.

20:07.843 --> 20:09.492
There are proper channels.

20:09.883 --> 20:11.916
That's the problem with you young
guys becoming boss too soon.

20:11.983 --> 20:14.303
- Please.
- You got no nose for protocol!

20:14.423 --> 20:16.387
No, but I'm a bloodhound
when it comes to bullshit.

20:16.454 --> 20:17.254
Oh!

20:17.322 --> 20:19.089
- You guys smell that?
- Huge whiff.

20:19.157 --> 20:21.751
Yeah, I smell it, too.
You step in something?

20:21.871 --> 20:23.277
You little shitbird.

20:23.397 --> 20:24.985
I hope you like Staten Island,

20:25.105 --> 20:28.248
'cause that's where your pasty ass is
gonna end up when the dust settles.

20:28.976 --> 20:32.301
Guys, there's a school burning down
on 117 and no available units.

20:32.421 --> 20:34.487
- Are there kids in there?
- It's a school, dipshit.

20:34.607 --> 20:36.696
All right, look, we're gonna
respond to this call ourselves.

20:36.816 --> 20:40.650
Lou, black Shawn and Damian,
you come with me, we'll take Tommy's truck.

20:40.770 --> 20:42.313
Tommy, come on, let's go!

20:42.380 --> 20:43.635
The rest of us in Niels' rig.

20:44.389 --> 20:45.730
In Niels' rig?

20:48.762 --> 20:51.522
I guess you missed out on the
cash for clunkers thing, huh?

20:51.590 --> 20:53.357
This is my grandma's car, chief.

20:53.425 --> 20:55.459
- Ah.
- It's got sentimental value.

21:08.840 --> 21:11.490
They're gonna kill themselves.

21:15.714 --> 21:16.971
You guys OK?

21:17.091 --> 21:19.083
I was OK, before the crash.

21:19.150 --> 21:20.710
Great driving, Niels.

21:20.975 --> 21:22.353
Your grandmother's gonna be pissed.

21:22.420 --> 21:24.121
It's OK, chief, she's dead.

21:24.189 --> 21:26.090
Come on, we're gonna have to hoof it.
Let's go.

21:26.645 --> 21:28.559
Hey, Ted, you mind staying
with grandma's car?

21:28.679 --> 21:30.306
Go ahead, I hate to run anyway.

21:31.284 --> 21:33.952
Ahh. This'll buff right out.

21:44.046 --> 21:45.013
You got any tools?

21:45.081 --> 21:46.048
Grab whatever you can.

21:46.116 --> 21:47.216
All right, listen.

21:47.283 --> 21:49.184
You take the second floor,
Lou and I are going to take

21:49.252 --> 21:50.586
the third. Boys, be careful.

21:50.653 --> 21:51.754
There are no available units.

21:51.821 --> 21:54.356
We got no lines, and we're going
to be on our own for a while.

21:54.424 --> 21:55.946
- Where am I going?
- You're not going anywhere.

21:56.066 --> 21:58.182
You don't know if you want to be
a firefighter or not anymore? Guess what.

21:58.222 --> 21:59.860
You work crowd control,
see how you like that.

22:00.116 --> 22:02.366
I don't want to work crowd control,
I want to work with you!

22:02.486 --> 22:05.982
Hey, you guys, you can't go in there!
You don't have any tools or any gear!

22:06.102 --> 22:07.302
I got a hell of a slapshot.

22:07.370 --> 22:08.741
- I'm coming in with you.
- No, no, no, father.

22:08.861 --> 22:09.850
I need you to stay here, alright?

22:09.970 --> 22:11.233
Keep these people calm. Lou?

22:11.353 --> 22:13.454
- Do me a favor. Videotape this whole thing.
- You're kidding me?

22:13.574 --> 22:14.658
Just get us coming out.

22:14.778 --> 22:16.674
It's gonna be our ace
in the hole, trust me.

22:18.004 --> 22:19.047
What are you doing?

22:19.115 --> 22:21.456
- There are kids in there, I'm going in.
- No, you're not, OK?

22:21.576 --> 22:23.440
They got enough to do without
you wandering around in there.

22:23.468 --> 22:24.459
They need our help!

22:24.579 --> 22:26.352
Listen, OK, you got your job,
you're crowd control.

22:26.472 --> 22:28.092
I'm gonna be Spielberg here.

22:29.149 --> 22:30.686
Danny Zuko would go in there.

22:36.466 --> 22:37.599
Hello?

22:37.667 --> 22:38.634
FDNY.

22:38.701 --> 22:39.668
FDNY.

22:40.913 --> 22:41.980
Hey, guys!

22:42.100 --> 22:43.472
Hello?

22:43.540 --> 22:46.341
Hey, sir, calm down,
we're with the FDNY.

22:46.409 --> 22:48.310
Sir! Hel... what's with this guy?

22:48.378 --> 22:49.511
I think he's loaded.

22:49.579 --> 22:50.546
I think he's deaf.

22:50.613 --> 22:51.780
Yeah, he is.

22:51.848 --> 22:52.848
How do you know he's deaf?

22:52.916 --> 22:54.851
Because.
I have a deaf sister.

22:54.852 --> 22:56.934
Colleen never mentioned
you have a deaf sister.

22:57.054 --> 22:58.720
Hey, hey, it's OK, sir.

22:58.788 --> 23:00.556
There you go. Follow him out.

23:00.623 --> 23:01.811
Go ahead.

23:05.050 --> 23:06.698
How did you do in chemistry
class in high school?

23:06.818 --> 23:08.966
Not good. Stabbed a couple frogs,
that was about it.

23:09.086 --> 23:10.476
- How about you?
- Aced it.

23:10.596 --> 23:12.012
- Really?
- Yeah, straight as.

23:14.423 --> 23:16.171
- You go first.
- Of course.

23:18.539 --> 23:19.712
Go that way.

23:32.273 --> 23:34.423
Are you OK, are you OK?

23:34.491 --> 23:36.158
Are you OK?

23:36.226 --> 23:39.449
Take the window, grab that.
All right, guys.

23:51.708 --> 23:53.496
- Hey, where they at?
- Second floor.

23:55.997 --> 23:58.567
Come on! Come on!

24:01.551 --> 24:02.851
Damian!

24:02.919 --> 24:03.852
Damian, no!

24:03.920 --> 24:05.754
Here, keep shooting.

24:05.822 --> 24:07.502
Just keep shooting.

24:09.998 --> 24:12.057
Jesus Christ.

24:15.141 --> 24:16.930
Frank!

24:19.836 --> 24:23.005
- Here, here, here, got him?
- Heads up, heads up.

24:25.590 --> 24:26.786
There you go.

24:30.270 --> 24:31.443
- I got her.
- Got her?

24:31.563 --> 24:32.449
Got her?

24:32.569 --> 24:33.390
Got her.

24:34.465 --> 24:35.597
Hey, fella?

24:35.717 --> 24:37.452
- How you doing?
- Got her?

24:37.520 --> 24:40.168
Let's take a little walk over there.

24:43.255 --> 24:44.721
- Any more?
- No.

24:50.190 --> 24:52.649
Oh, father Phil.

24:56.582 --> 24:59.669
Excuse me, those guys that just
saved the kids, are they firemen?

24:59.789 --> 25:02.086
Huh. They used to be.

25:12.363 --> 25:13.536
- You good, man?
- Yeah, you all right?

25:13.656 --> 25:15.618
Yeah, I'm OK. Phew. Wow.

25:15.738 --> 25:17.693
Hey, uh, listen, Tommy.

25:17.760 --> 25:18.994
I wanted to talk to you, man.

25:19.062 --> 25:22.130
I, um...
Just wanted to apologize.

25:23.068 --> 25:26.635
You know. I mean, that was...
what I did was just completely,

25:26.703 --> 25:29.271
completely out of line, you know?
You're my friend

25:29.339 --> 25:33.241
and I feel like I betrayed you, you know?
I mean, Janet's your wife.

25:33.309 --> 25:35.323
- Yeah. - And I don't have any business
hanging around there.

25:35.443 --> 25:36.056
Mm-hmm.

25:36.176 --> 25:37.748
- You know, poking my nose...
- What was it, really,

25:37.868 --> 25:40.182
that you guys were doing?
You know? What was it, really?

25:40.249 --> 25:44.302
It was just like, you know,
like a momentary flirtation.

25:44.422 --> 25:45.405
You know what I mean?

25:45.525 --> 25:46.822
Just like in my mind, kind of.

25:46.889 --> 25:49.360
So you didn't touch my wife's ass?

25:49.611 --> 25:51.433
- No, no.
- Ok.

25:51.553 --> 25:52.828
I would never, no.

25:52.895 --> 25:54.000
- It never got physical.
- Ok.

25:54.120 --> 25:55.201
Not in any way.

25:56.309 --> 25:59.802
You know, I mean, I had thoughts.
I saw her ass.

26:00.346 --> 26:03.138
She's got a great...
I mean, you know.

26:03.206 --> 26:06.173
She's your wife.
I mean, she's a beautiful lady.

26:06.293 --> 26:07.142
Yes, she is.

26:07.210 --> 26:10.045
You know what I'm saying, she's,
um, she's a great lady.

26:10.113 --> 26:11.146
Yes, she is.

26:11.214 --> 26:12.763
She's banging, really.

26:14.505 --> 26:16.652
I'm overreaching there.
That was the wrong word.

26:16.719 --> 26:20.555
Not banging. She's, um...
Beautiful.

26:20.623 --> 26:23.337
You said banging.

26:23.937 --> 26:24.926
Banging.

26:25.781 --> 26:27.675
I guess I...I did.

26:28.363 --> 26:29.844
I did say banging.

26:35.255 --> 26:36.624
So we're good?

26:38.271 --> 26:41.754
What about us? You and me.
I mean, we cool, man?

26:42.078 --> 26:44.906
You know, I can't believe I let a pussy
like you beat the shit out of me.

26:45.270 --> 26:48.741
Pff, bullshit. I mean I gave you
that Sugar Shane...

26:48.861 --> 26:51.326
Mayweather, Manny Pacquiao business, son!

26:51.375 --> 26:52.487
Yeah, you did. You did.

26:52.555 --> 26:55.123
And I deserved it.
Yeah, we're cool.

26:55.191 --> 26:56.358
Sorry, bro.

26:56.426 --> 26:59.883
Squash. Come on, man, I want to
show you my new hunting rifle.

27:00.554 --> 27:01.755
What?

27:04.867 --> 27:07.135
Unh, God damn it.

27:11.658 --> 27:12.641
Yeah?

27:12.709 --> 27:16.831
So, Katie has a sleepover and Wyatt's
gonna go with Colleen to Shawn's,

27:16.951 --> 27:18.913
so we're in the clear.
What time's good?

27:19.033 --> 27:20.749
Ooh, uh, let's say 8:30.

27:20.817 --> 27:22.818
Ok. And what should I wear?

27:23.724 --> 27:25.037
How about nothin'?

27:25.157 --> 27:26.266
To dinner.

27:27.406 --> 27:28.724
Right, dinner.

27:28.791 --> 27:31.144
- You didn't think that...
- No, of dinner.

27:31.191 --> 27:33.195
I've been thinking about dinner all day.

27:33.262 --> 27:34.596
Yeah? And?

27:34.664 --> 27:36.031
Where we going?

27:36.099 --> 27:39.735
Where are we going for dinner?
We're going to...

27:39.802 --> 27:41.948
I thought that you said that you've
been thinking about it a lot.

27:42.068 --> 27:44.532
I have. We are going
to Davio's for dinner.

27:44.652 --> 27:48.009
Davio's? God, that place
was a dump 5 years ago.

27:48.077 --> 27:49.511
Yeah, that place is a dump.

27:49.579 --> 27:52.781
Silvio's. Brand new restaurant,
outrageous reviews. Say Silvio's!

27:52.849 --> 27:53.587
Silvio's!

27:53.647 --> 27:55.884
Silvio's?
What, that new place downtown?

27:56.519 --> 27:57.833
Their lobster frioli is to die for.

27:57.953 --> 27:59.342
Their lobster frioli's to die for.

27:59.462 --> 28:00.669
Oh, I love lobster frioli.

28:00.789 --> 28:01.577
What?

28:01.833 --> 28:03.291
- Be ready at 7:00.
- Be ready at 7:00.

28:03.411 --> 28:06.457
- And wear the low-cut fuschia dress.
- And wear the low-cut fuschia dress.

28:06.577 --> 28:08.142
- Fuschia?
- Hot pink.

28:08.262 --> 28:09.264
Hot pink.

28:09.384 --> 28:13.394
Ok, well, your wish is my command.
Hey, why 7:00?

28:13.736 --> 28:14.703
Why 7:00?

28:14.771 --> 28:18.173
Because you have 2 tickets to Tony
Bennett at the Blue Note at 9:00.

28:18.241 --> 28:21.643
What... Because we have 2
tickets to Tony Bennett

28:21.711 --> 28:23.712
at the Blue Note at 9:00.

28:23.780 --> 28:25.280
Tommy, that is amazing.

28:25.348 --> 28:30.225
Yeah! That's... do I not know how to...
Swing, baby, swing.

28:30.345 --> 28:31.804
Swing, baby, swing.

28:31.924 --> 28:33.455
Swing? What?

28:34.121 --> 28:36.635
I'll see ya then.

28:36.984 --> 28:40.161
Ok. Hey, I am really excited.

28:40.281 --> 28:40.971
Ok.

28:41.091 --> 28:42.164
- Bye.
- Bye.

28:43.666 --> 28:44.933
What was the swing thing?

28:45.001 --> 28:47.302
Yeah, I got a little carried away.
Listen,

28:47.370 --> 28:50.850
the Tony Bennett tickets are mine.
They were extremely hard to get.

28:50.970 --> 28:52.974
But the food at Silvio's,
you're gonna die.

28:53.042 --> 28:54.109
It's off the map.

28:54.177 --> 28:55.977
And you're gonna want to
have sex right on the table.

28:56.045 --> 28:58.814
But don't, because they frown on it.
Unless you get a seat

28:58.881 --> 29:01.501
near the back, in which case
they may just wanna watch.

29:02.730 --> 29:04.909
Hey, that little deaf mute
kid just gave me the finger.

29:05.147 --> 29:06.621
Nnnn!

29:14.926 --> 29:17.194
Tommy, I just want to say
before we eat, drink

29:17.262 --> 29:20.816
and be merry, that I am going to try
really hard to make tonight

29:20.936 --> 29:23.667
as wonderful as you have made
it in the planning stages.

29:23.735 --> 29:25.900
Honey, I didn't really do anything.

29:26.020 --> 29:27.254
Tommy, you did.

29:27.715 --> 29:28.721
Ok, I did.

29:29.042 --> 29:31.068
SO I want tonight to be special for us too.

29:31.409 --> 29:33.203
You know, none of the old bitterness.

29:33.323 --> 29:37.031
I know that I can sometimes be too
demanding or disappointed or

29:37.151 --> 29:39.920
expect you to say and do certain
things or read my mind.

29:40.730 --> 29:43.420
But tonight, it's a new leaf.

29:44.065 --> 29:48.092
Ok, I'm gonna go with the flow
and have no expectations.

29:48.159 --> 29:49.159
Cool.

29:49.227 --> 29:50.116
Great.

29:51.050 --> 29:53.597
- Oh, and I am so excited
to see Tony Bennett. - I know.

29:53.665 --> 29:54.579
Awesome.

29:54.699 --> 29:55.666
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

29:56.251 --> 29:58.170
- Hey, napkin.
- Hmm?

29:58.290 --> 29:59.670
- Napkin.
- Oh, right.

30:03.808 --> 30:06.243
Oh, Tommy, this menu.

30:08.146 --> 30:10.281
Mmm. Oh.

30:12.684 --> 30:14.754
What... that's it?

30:15.287 --> 30:16.387
Huh?

30:16.454 --> 30:18.555
What, you're done?

30:18.623 --> 30:19.590
You know what you're ordering?

30:19.658 --> 30:21.592
Yeah, yeah, I'm getting
that lobster thing.

30:21.660 --> 30:23.801
OK, Tommy, do you even
know what that is?

30:24.095 --> 30:27.031
It's lobster.
I mean, it's a nice restaurant.

30:27.098 --> 30:28.632
It's probably a giant lobster
with a shitload of butter.

30:28.752 --> 30:31.596
You know, they're Italians.
They do all kinds of special stuff.

30:32.423 --> 30:34.055
Yeah.

30:36.234 --> 30:39.009
You want to know something
else that I've decided?

30:39.077 --> 30:43.180
That you're going to have that
shrimp thing as an appetizer?

30:43.598 --> 30:44.791
How'd you know that?

30:44.911 --> 30:46.984
You know, I guess that we've
just been together so long

30:47.052 --> 30:48.852
that I can read your mind.

30:48.920 --> 30:51.121
- Yes, we have a...
- A connection, right.

30:51.189 --> 30:54.358
- You just know someone...
- If only I could vice versa.

30:54.426 --> 30:57.828
It would make things so much better.
No, I've decided

30:57.896 --> 31:03.334
something else while I'm in
my... ahem... super decisive mode.

31:03.401 --> 31:04.221
Oh.

31:04.341 --> 31:13.143
I have decided that you have the
most beautiful eyes on the planet.

31:14.781 --> 31:18.050
And your tits, just... Hey.

31:18.416 --> 31:19.383
- Hi.
- Hi.

31:19.503 --> 31:21.067
So we have a few
specials this evening.

31:21.187 --> 31:22.059
Ok, cool.

31:22.179 --> 31:24.901
Tonight we have a brasoto al
borolo, which is a braised beef

31:25.021 --> 31:26.090
with porcini mushrooms.

31:26.157 --> 31:29.526
We also have guancia ripiena,
with fontina and sage,

31:29.594 --> 31:30.861
eggplant caponata.

31:30.929 --> 31:31.995
And broccoli rabe pesto.

31:32.821 --> 31:34.431
Oh, OK, that sounds so good.

31:34.499 --> 31:36.887
Yeah, it sounds...
What is it?

31:37.402 --> 31:39.888
It's prosciutto wrapped veal cheek.

31:40.008 --> 31:41.105
Aw!

31:41.172 --> 31:42.606
Wow, prosciutto.

31:44.318 --> 31:47.262
Or is that vio cheek um...

31:47.382 --> 31:50.262
cheek cheek or is it that the ass cheek?

31:54.061 --> 31:56.350
It's served as a side with fontina and sage.

31:56.617 --> 31:58.084
Oh, sounds good.

31:58.204 --> 31:59.635
I saw them once in concert.

31:59.755 --> 32:03.306
Excellent Simon and
Garfunkle tribute band.

32:04.299 --> 32:05.975
Fontina. Sage.

32:07.558 --> 32:09.032
You know.

32:09.100 --> 32:11.101
Fontina and sage.

32:11.169 --> 32:13.139
Come on, that was good.
That's funny.

32:15.613 --> 32:19.331
For dessert, we have this
spiced chestnut budino.

32:19.778 --> 32:22.837
It comes with cherry marmalata
and maraschino zabaione.

32:23.242 --> 32:24.882
Ok, that sounds heavenly.

32:24.949 --> 32:25.916
Yeah, it's exquisite.

32:25.984 --> 32:27.317
And what is it?

32:27.385 --> 32:28.452
Budino.

32:28.520 --> 32:32.207
- No, no, I heard that.
Is it a cake? - No.

32:32.473 --> 32:34.149
- Is it a pie?
- No.

32:35.602 --> 32:37.628
You said... It's gotta
definitely have a cherry thing

32:37.695 --> 32:39.596
going on, 'cause you
mentioned... Yeah, yeah.

32:39.664 --> 32:41.413
- Yeah, it's like cherry marma...
- Marmalata.

32:41.533 --> 32:43.802
- Is that a jelly? A cherry...
- No.

32:44.252 --> 32:45.180
No?

32:45.300 --> 32:47.276
Didn't you say some kind
of cherry marachino...

32:47.313 --> 32:48.100
Maraschino.

32:48.220 --> 32:49.539
Is that... Ow!

32:50.241 --> 32:52.910
You know, I think that
I will order now.

32:52.977 --> 32:54.011
Yes, we're ready to order.

32:54.078 --> 32:58.449
Um, you know, that
budino sounds heavenly.

32:58.516 --> 32:59.316
Yeah.

32:59.384 --> 33:01.725
I'm definitely going to end with
that, and then I was thinking...

33:01.845 --> 33:03.527
Well, honey, we don't even really
even know what that is yet.

33:03.647 --> 33:06.167
It's pudding. It's a chestnut pudding.
It's pudding.

33:06.287 --> 33:07.347
- It's pudding?
- Pudding, yeah.

33:07.467 --> 33:08.874
- Pudino means pudding?
- Budino.

33:08.994 --> 33:10.828
Budino, yeah. Ok.

33:10.895 --> 33:11.862
Pudding.

33:12.641 --> 33:14.415
- Yeah. That's Italian?
- Yeah.

33:14.535 --> 33:15.621
- Really?
- Yeah.

33:16.389 --> 33:19.377
- Is that like a recently added Italian...
- Yeah, just now.

33:19.412 --> 33:21.456
Made it up like 2 hours ago
'cause I was bored.

33:21.576 --> 33:22.479
Really?

33:22.599 --> 33:23.617
You want to know what?

33:23.737 --> 33:26.677
I think that I'm going to cancel my order.
I have tickets

33:26.744 --> 33:30.013
for Tony Bennett and he goes on at 9:00.
And that only will give

33:30.081 --> 33:34.051
me an hour and a half to find
a replacement for this stronzo.

33:34.118 --> 33:35.478
Honey...

33:37.364 --> 33:38.356
Honey.

33:40.996 --> 33:42.125
Tony Bennett, huh?

33:42.193 --> 33:43.060
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

33:43.127 --> 33:44.261
Great.

33:44.329 --> 33:45.827
- She's just gonna go to the restroom...
- Enjoy.

33:45.947 --> 33:47.447
What? Hey!

33:48.466 --> 33:50.100
What an asshole.

33:51.227 --> 33:52.469
Hey, honey!

33:53.226 --> 33:56.719
- Wait a minute. What are you...
- OK, well, call me when you know.

33:57.110 --> 33:58.876
What, we're leaving?

33:58.943 --> 34:00.240
You know what, I should have known better.

34:00.360 --> 34:02.978
Ok, we can't do anything nice,
we can't do anything nice...

34:03.098 --> 34:05.115
- What? This is a nice place. - You know
I'm going to Tony Bennet with Marsha.

34:05.235 --> 34:06.959
- What?!
- Ok, so just give me the goddamn tickets.

34:07.406 --> 34:09.025
The tickets are mine, OK?
And you know what,

34:09.069 --> 34:09.985
I'm going... I'm calling Lou.

34:10.034 --> 34:10.998
They're half mine.

34:11.118 --> 34:12.268
Ok, then you're going to
be sitting next to me.

34:12.389 --> 34:13.833
No, then you're going to
be sitting next to Marsha.

34:13.953 --> 34:15.956
Then Marsha's going to be sitting
next to Lou, how's that?

34:16.077 --> 34:17.967
Oh, just give the
goddamn tickets, Tommy!

34:18.087 --> 34:19.444
- Knock it off!
- Hey, hey!

34:19.563 --> 34:21.331
Hey!
Hey, asshole.

34:21.399 --> 34:22.768
- Mind your own business.
- Just mind your own goddamn business.

34:22.888 --> 34:25.311
Private conversation. Yeah, you, too.
What are you lookin' at?

34:25.431 --> 34:28.134
Two people are having
a conversation. Jesus Christ.

34:29.774 --> 34:30.708
Give me the goddamn tickets.

34:30.828 --> 34:31.630
- You want the tickets?
- Yeah.

34:31.750 --> 34:32.985
- You want the tickets?
- Yeah.

34:35.610 --> 34:37.239
- Do you have the tickets?
- Yeah, I've got the tickets.

34:37.359 --> 34:38.496
Here you go, OK? Go ahead,

34:38.556 --> 34:40.821
go enjoy the... the...
with fat ass Marsha.

34:40.862 --> 34:44.266
I'm gonna sit down and eat my meal,
what do you think of that? Yeah...

34:50.985 --> 34:51.822
Damn it!

34:51.943 --> 34:54.518
Do you know the shit I
went through to get these?

34:54.639 --> 34:55.623
Oh, really?

34:55.743 --> 34:58.683
Yeah. And what the hell's with
that language bullshit in there?

34:58.803 --> 35:00.826
Oh, Tommy, there's so much shit
that you don't know about me!

35:00.946 --> 35:02.726
Oh, really, that I don't... like what?

35:02.846 --> 35:04.493
Like maybe I decided to
learn a new language,

35:04.613 --> 35:07.945
to challenge myself or better
myself, in the very, very, very

35:08.065 --> 35:11.264
off chance that we might go on some
romantic trip overseas someday.

35:11.694 --> 35:13.503
- And you know what the funny thing is?
- What, what?

35:13.623 --> 35:16.086
I actually learned the dirty
words first, 'cause I thought

35:16.154 --> 35:17.234
that you might actually
think that they were funny.

35:17.354 --> 35:18.393
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

35:18.513 --> 35:20.670
You know what... I swear to God.

35:20.790 --> 35:23.351
- Ok? And then I lost interest in it,
Tommy, you know why? - Why?

35:23.471 --> 35:26.244
Because my whole goddamn world
fell apart when 2 planes

35:26.364 --> 35:29.199
flew into a building,
when you disappeared

35:29.267 --> 35:32.970
into a bottle, and in between the legs
of your goddamn cousin's wife!

35:33.037 --> 35:34.137
God damn it, knock it off!

35:35.888 --> 35:36.900
Knock it off!

35:37.020 --> 35:40.029
Stop it. Relax.

35:42.463 --> 35:43.580
Purse?

35:43.648 --> 35:45.048
Yeah, thank you.

35:45.572 --> 35:46.928
- You OK?
- She's fine.

35:47.048 --> 35:49.302
- She doesn't look fine.
- She's fine, all right?

35:49.422 --> 35:51.914
You know, if I had a woman like that,
I wouldn't treat her like this.

35:52.034 --> 35:54.791
Ok. Just mind your own
goddamn business, OK?

35:54.859 --> 35:56.994
- DeNiro face.
- DeNiro, 'cause I'm Italian.

35:57.061 --> 35:58.655
- Yes, yes.
- Oh, brilliant, brilliant.

35:58.775 --> 36:01.464
How about I get a mohawk and mess
with you? You know, mess you up a little?

36:01.584 --> 36:03.517
How's that?
I'm gonna call the cops.

36:03.637 --> 36:05.047
- Go ahead.
- I'm going to.

36:05.167 --> 36:06.767
- Go.
- I'm going right now.

36:06.887 --> 36:08.573
- I'll be right back.
- Yeah, talkin' to you.

36:08.693 --> 36:10.990
Talkin' to you, Simon and Garfunkle.

36:11.110 --> 36:13.110
What... what he'd say?

36:13.177 --> 36:15.224
Simon and Garfunkle.

36:17.340 --> 36:20.469
Tommy...I didn't care about the tickets.

36:21.433 --> 36:23.249
Ok? I just... I wanted to be happy.

36:24.524 --> 36:27.891
You know, I wanted you to be
my husband, I wanted a house.

36:28.994 --> 36:31.128
Just some things.

36:31.434 --> 36:32.957
Sorry.

36:35.056 --> 36:38.902
I can't... I can't undo what I
did and whatever happened,

36:38.970 --> 36:43.069
but I can just start now and try to...

36:43.544 --> 36:45.429
- Mr. and Mrs. Gavin.
- Yeah?

36:46.215 --> 36:47.477
Hey.

36:47.545 --> 36:49.303
- Joey?
- Yeah.

36:51.817 --> 36:53.083
What are you doing here?

36:53.151 --> 36:55.828
I work here. They sent me out
because I said I knew you.

36:55.948 --> 36:57.393
They were gonna call the cops.

36:57.728 --> 37:00.564
But I told them you guys do
stuff like this all the time.

37:01.025 --> 37:03.347
But that it's OK, that you're cool.

37:03.467 --> 37:06.853
Yeah, yeah. He's just overreacting.
Crazy, crazy, that guy.

37:07.899 --> 37:09.166
But you're so tall.

37:09.233 --> 37:11.268
- Yeah!
- How old are you now?

37:11.335 --> 37:12.402
I'm 17.

37:12.470 --> 37:13.704
Wow.

37:13.771 --> 37:14.882
17.

37:15.713 --> 37:18.228
'Cause I have a photo of you and
Connor when

37:18.513 --> 37:19.785
you guys aren't even up to my waist.

37:19.905 --> 37:21.168
- Yeah.
- From baseball camp.

37:21.213 --> 37:23.604
- Right.
- Yeah, I have that picture, too.

37:24.624 --> 37:25.797
How's Colleen?

37:26.384 --> 37:30.045
She's good, she's doing great.
She's great.

37:30.165 --> 37:31.344
Good.

37:32.590 --> 37:33.890
What?

37:34.331 --> 37:36.226
Do I have something on my face?

37:36.294 --> 37:37.868
- No, no.
- No.

37:37.988 --> 37:38.946
No.

37:39.184 --> 37:41.628
Connor probably would have been
a lot taller than me now, huh?

37:41.748 --> 37:43.986
- Yeah, he was always a string bean.
- Yeah.

37:44.106 --> 37:46.070
He was always bigger than me.

37:48.668 --> 37:50.467
Well, I should get back inside.

37:50.746 --> 37:51.875
Ok.

37:51.943 --> 37:52.774
It's nice seeing you.

37:52.824 --> 37:54.936
Hey, tell your parents
we said, you know, hey.

37:55.383 --> 37:57.736
- Yeah, tell Colleen that I said hey.
- Okay.

37:57.856 --> 37:59.200
- All right.
- All right, nice seeing you.

37:59.320 --> 38:00.233
Yeah.

38:05.074 --> 38:06.373
He's huge.
