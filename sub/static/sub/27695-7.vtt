J " Gloriana J".

00:13.848 --> 00:20.021
J " Gloriana J".

00:26.444 --> 00:33.326
J " Gloriana, hallelujah J".

00:41.751 --> 00:48.299
<i>S'?</i>

00:54.722 --> 00:56.390
We can't go on like this.

00:59.810 --> 01:02.813
It's time we made a life
together.

01:02.980 --> 01:04.523
How would we do that?

01:08.194 --> 01:09.296
Look at this necklace, Sophie.

01:09.320 --> 01:11.989
This should do

01:12.156 --> 01:15.409
until... I make my fortune.

01:18.496 --> 01:20.414
There are goldmines
in California.

01:22.166 --> 01:23.334
America?

01:23.501 --> 01:24.585
As far away from Monmouth

01:24.752 --> 01:27.046
and Mr. Penge as possible.

01:27.213 --> 01:32.635
<i>S'?</i>

01:32.802 --> 01:35.096
It's perfect!

01:35.263 --> 01:39.100
Look, even the veins
on the leaf.

01:39.267 --> 01:41.018
It is remarkable.

01:44.105 --> 01:47.024
This looks like a bronze
by Cellini,

01:47.191 --> 01:50.653
but if you lift it up...
It's light as a feather!

01:50.820 --> 01:52.540
That's because inside
it's plaster of Paris.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.413
We dip it in the tank,
and just like the rose,

01:54.532 --> 01:57.785
it's covered in a thin film
of metal.

01:57.952 --> 01:59.912
And yet it looks exactly
like the real thing!

02:00.079 --> 02:01.664
This electroplating is a chance

02:01.831 --> 02:04.083
for great work to be within
the reach of the common man.

02:04.250 --> 02:07.753
Dukes and dustmen can both
be surrounded by works of art!

02:11.132 --> 02:12.466
Ah, Victoria, please.

02:12.633 --> 02:13.860
I do not think
you have met Mr. Cole...

02:13.884 --> 02:15.303
He is my colleague

02:15.469 --> 02:17.114
from the Royal Society
of Arts and Commerce.

02:17.138 --> 02:18.514
Your Majesty.

02:18.681 --> 02:20.933
I've never met
a man with quite so much

02:21.100 --> 02:22.768
energy-

02:22.935 --> 02:25.396
If you want steam, get Cole!

02:25.563 --> 02:26.647
(Uaughs)

02:28.441 --> 02:30.318
We have just been discussing

02:30.484 --> 02:32.820
the Society's
forthcoming exhibition.

02:32.987 --> 02:34.113
Oh!

02:37.283 --> 02:39.035
Gold-plated roses.

02:39.201 --> 02:41.078
So this is what
you are planning to show?

02:41.245 --> 02:44.373
Amongst other wonders, ma'am.

02:44.540 --> 02:47.001
If you had seen how
the electroplating bath works,

02:47.168 --> 02:49.754
Drina, it is truly remarkable.

02:49.920 --> 02:51.380
Really?

02:51.547 --> 02:54.008
Would you like me to give you
a demonstration, ma'am?

02:54.175 --> 02:55.968
Oh, don't worry.

02:56.135 --> 02:58.304
I don't want to interrupt
your work.

02:59.764 --> 03:02.224
Besides, I have my boxes
to attend to.

03:06.854 --> 03:09.357
<i>S'?</i>

03:09.523 --> 03:11.150
<i>Humiliation!</i>

03:12.902 --> 03:14.737
<i>Don Pacifico,
a British citizen in Athens,</i>

03:14.904 --> 03:17.323
<i>was attacked by a mob.</i>

03:17.490 --> 03:19.408
Because he is a Jew.

03:19.575 --> 03:23.287
<i>The police didn't simply
watch it happen...</i>

03:24.497 --> 03:25.581
<i>they joined in.</i>

03:27.875 --> 03:32.213
We must restore the dignity
of Her Majesty's subject.

03:35.257 --> 03:41.931
<i>S'?</i>

03:42.098 --> 03:44.392
I agree with what you said
in there, Lord Palmerston,

03:44.558 --> 03:47.478
but how do you propose
to avenge one man's dignity?

03:47.645 --> 03:49.188
Send in the Duke of Wellington?

03:49.355 --> 03:50.439
If it comes to that.

03:50.606 --> 03:54.652
<i>S'?</i>

04:02.952 --> 04:04.078
Good morning, Mama.

04:05.704 --> 04:06.831
Yes, good morning.

04:10.584 --> 04:13.003
Ls that me when I was a baby?

04:15.756 --> 04:18.217
I hope I grow up
and live happily ever after.

04:18.384 --> 04:19.844
Like you and Papa.

04:20.010 --> 04:25.933
<i>S'?</i>

04:34.024 --> 04:36.610
Do I need to remind you, Joseph,
that I expect footmen

04:36.777 --> 04:39.989
to be respectfully dressed
at all times?

04:40.156 --> 04:42.741
My appearance has always
upset you, Mr. Penge.

04:42.908 --> 04:43.993
Why should today

04:44.160 --> 04:45.286
be any different?

04:52.126 --> 04:54.837
Joseph!

04:55.004 --> 04:57.214
I know you're upset,
but promise me you won't

04:57.381 --> 04:58.900
give Mr. Penge
any more reason to hate you!

04:58.924 --> 05:00.235
There are plenty of reasons
to hate me.

05:00.259 --> 05:02.303
But be careful.

05:02.470 --> 05:04.638
In my experience,
when people are in love,

05:04.805 --> 05:08.726
they forget to
keep their wits about them.

05:12.313 --> 05:13.647
Why didn't the police intervene?

05:13.814 --> 05:15.941
They were too busy
throwing rocks

05:16.108 --> 05:18.486
at the poor man and his family
along with the rabble.

05:18.652 --> 05:20.988
I thought,
as somebody who can't abide

05:21.155 --> 05:22.406
religious intolerance,

05:22.573 --> 05:25.367
that you may have
an opinion on the matter.

05:25.534 --> 05:26.660
Indeed.

05:26.827 --> 05:27.995
We should take action.

05:28.162 --> 05:29.955
I intend to, ma'am,
with your blessing.

05:30.122 --> 05:31.832
Whatever is necessary.

05:36.962 --> 05:39.590
I thought it would be best
if I explain the situation

05:39.757 --> 05:42.009
to Your Majesty
and the prince in person.

05:43.469 --> 05:46.972
The prince is too busy,
with Mr. Cole.

05:47.139 --> 05:48.933
Cole!

05:49.099 --> 05:50.809
I'm surprised he has the time.

05:50.976 --> 05:54.146
He's always so busy
designing teapots.

05:56.524 --> 05:59.068
He and the prince
are thick as thieves.

05:59.235 --> 06:01.529
Really?

06:04.657 --> 06:06.575
His Royal Highness
has a proposition

06:06.742 --> 06:08.160
to make to the committee.

06:11.205 --> 06:17.002
I think that our annual
exhibition is too...

06:17.169 --> 06:18.295
parochial.

06:18.462 --> 06:20.589
So, I propose that

06:20.756 --> 06:22.800
this year we invite
other nations,

06:22.967 --> 06:26.053
to send their finest products.

06:26.220 --> 06:29.056
Afair to show
the whole world's ingenuity.

06:29.223 --> 06:31.934
With all due respect, Cole,
there's a reason.

06:32.101 --> 06:33.519
We don't invite foreigners.

06:33.686 --> 06:36.355
I don't think Manchester cottons
want to be displayed

06:36.522 --> 06:38.023
next to French silks.

06:41.360 --> 06:43.988
But we have
nothing to be afraid of!

06:44.154 --> 06:45.781
What of worth
has ever been achieved

06:45.948 --> 06:48.367
which did not inspire fear?

06:48.534 --> 06:50.428
Imagine if the Egyptians
had given into their doubts

06:50.452 --> 06:52.663
before they began
the Great Pyramid of Giza,

06:52.830 --> 06:55.082
or the Greeks
the Lighthouse of Alexandria?

06:55.249 --> 06:58.085
For an exhibition
on the scale you imagine

06:58.252 --> 06:59.962
we'd have to build a new hall,

07:00.129 --> 07:02.169
and that would cost money
we don't have, I'm afraid.

07:03.382 --> 07:07.511
There will be some
practicalities to overcome,

07:07.678 --> 07:09.513
that I, I cannot deny.

07:25.362 --> 07:26.572
Mm!

07:27.865 --> 07:28.991
Mm...

07:31.076 --> 07:32.494
Ooh!

07:32.661 --> 07:33.746
(Uaughs)

07:33.912 --> 07:35.039
Ah...

07:36.957 --> 07:38.208
Thank you, Your Grace.

07:38.375 --> 07:39.835
Hm.

07:45.257 --> 07:48.594
I believe my wife's
having relations

07:48.761 --> 07:49.970
with one of your footmen.

07:52.056 --> 07:53.140
Um...

07:56.518 --> 08:00.981
I have my suspicions
about who it might be.

08:01.148 --> 08:02.858
The man will go to any length

08:03.025 --> 08:04.943
to get ahead.

08:05.110 --> 08:06.904
Well, the trouble is,
I need evidence.

08:07.071 --> 08:09.740
I can't follow her
around the palace myself,

08:09.907 --> 08:13.369
so I need somebody...
trustworthy

08:13.535 --> 08:14.662
to do it on my behalf.

08:17.247 --> 08:18.374
Indeed, Your Grace.

08:20.334 --> 08:26.548
May one ask... what you intend
to do with such evidence?

08:26.715 --> 08:28.717
I intend to prosecute
the footman for interfering

08:28.884 --> 08:30.594
with my property.

08:30.761 --> 08:33.931
And you will need to give
evidence in court.

08:34.098 --> 08:38.310
Well, perhaps this will help you
overcome any scruples?

08:40.145 --> 08:44.316
<i>S'?</i>

09:08.882 --> 09:11.552
I had no idea
you played so well.

09:11.719 --> 09:13.262
Oh, I've fallen out of practice.

09:13.429 --> 09:16.098
My husband is not so fond
of music.

09:18.892 --> 09:23.605
It seems to me your husband
is not a man of taste.

09:23.772 --> 09:24.898
No.

09:28.569 --> 09:30.446
When we were first married,

09:30.612 --> 09:34.116
Albert used to spend hours
watching me at the piano.

09:34.283 --> 09:35.367
I'm sure he would now,

09:35.534 --> 09:37.411
if he had more time, ma'am.

09:41.373 --> 09:42.499
I'm not so sure.

09:45.878 --> 09:47.379
Ever since Feodora came, he...

09:50.382 --> 09:52.259
never smiles at me anymore.

09:55.512 --> 09:57.157
I always used to be able
to make him laugh,

09:57.181 --> 10:00.767
I used to be his...

10:00.934 --> 10:02.936
friend, his companion.

10:07.566 --> 10:09.318
Now I feel I'm just his wife.

10:13.489 --> 10:17.451
True love, in... in whatever
form it finds itself,

10:17.618 --> 10:21.038
is just as hard to lose
as it is to find.

10:26.376 --> 10:29.129
Please, play some more.

10:33.967 --> 10:35.802
<i>The Greek government,</i>

10:35.969 --> 10:39.056
led by that German princeling
King Otto,

10:39.223 --> 10:41.558
has refused to make reparation

10:41.725 --> 10:45.145
for the insult inflicted upon
one of our citizens...

10:45.312 --> 10:46.480
Don Pacifico.

10:49.066 --> 10:50.526
We must show

10:50.692 --> 10:53.320
that we will not tolerate
this flagrant abuse

10:53.487 --> 10:55.989
of all international standards
of decency.

11:00.702 --> 11:04.289
I have discussed the matter
with Her Majesty

11:06.208 --> 11:09.127
and she agrees with me.

11:09.294 --> 11:11.338
But what do you propose, sir?

11:13.090 --> 11:18.971
<i>S'?</i>

11:19.137 --> 11:20.264
Albert.

11:22.391 --> 11:23.934
Prime Minister!

11:24.101 --> 11:26.853
Have you heard about
Palmerston's latest outrage?

11:27.020 --> 11:30.983
He is proposing a naval blockade
of Athens.

11:31.149 --> 11:32.317
Did he mention

11:32.484 --> 11:34.486
any of this to you,
when you spoke with him?

11:34.653 --> 11:37.072
He told me about the plight
of Don Pacifico

11:37.239 --> 11:40.242
and we agreed
that something must be done.

11:41.994 --> 11:43.620
He is a British subject.

11:43.787 --> 11:46.206
Palmerston is...

11:46.373 --> 11:47.916
so persuasive.

11:48.083 --> 11:50.243
You probably didn't understand
the implications, Drina.

11:51.461 --> 11:53.380
Victoria, I implore you,

11:53.547 --> 11:56.883
stop this man,
before his recklessness

11:57.050 --> 12:00.095
turns this whole situation
into a war.

12:02.723 --> 12:04.766
Do you believe if Palmerston
carries out this plan

12:04.933 --> 12:07.227
that war is inevitable?

12:07.394 --> 12:09.062
Lcannotsay what Palmerston

12:09.229 --> 12:12.858
and his gunboat diplomacy will
mean to this country, ma'am.

12:13.025 --> 12:16.445
And I'm afraid I am not the best
person to advise you anymore.

12:18.196 --> 12:19.882
But you're the
commander-in-chief of the army.

12:19.906 --> 12:21.783
Not for much longer, ma'am.

12:21.950 --> 12:23.952
Duke, does that mean...

12:24.119 --> 12:26.121
It has been an honor

12:26.288 --> 12:28.081
to serve you, ma'am...

12:29.207 --> 12:30.792
but my time has come.

12:32.753 --> 12:35.964
Duke, this country needs you,
now more than ever.

12:36.131 --> 12:38.467
You need a younger man,

12:38.634 --> 12:42.346
someone who can keep
Lord Palmerston in check.

12:42.512 --> 12:45.807
So you do believe he's putting
this country in danger?

12:47.851 --> 12:50.437
That is not for me to say.

12:50.604 --> 12:53.857
You are, however, in safe hands
with the prince, ma'am.

12:54.024 --> 12:57.486
I am certain that he
will give you very good advice.

12:57.653 --> 13:02.407
<i>S'?</i>

13:17.547 --> 13:19.758
I believe you have
the knave of hearts, Sophie.

13:21.927 --> 13:23.512
How did you know?

13:23.679 --> 13:26.807
Oh, I have played
many card games in my time.

13:26.973 --> 13:28.975
You need to be careful,

13:29.142 --> 13:30.769
for his sake
as well as your own.

13:33.105 --> 13:34.332
I wonder if you know
what happened

13:34.356 --> 13:36.358
to Caroline Norton.

13:36.525 --> 13:38.211
She was accused of having
a criminal conversation

13:38.235 --> 13:39.361
with Lord Melbourne.

13:41.697 --> 13:45.033
She never saw her fortune
or her children again.

13:47.953 --> 13:51.915
Melbourne was lucky to spend
his last days in Brocket Hall

13:52.082 --> 13:53.583
and not Newgate Prison.

13:56.128 --> 13:58.004
Had he been an ordinary man...

13:59.881 --> 14:02.092
I very much doubt the jury
would have been so lenient.

14:05.303 --> 14:06.388
No question.

14:06.555 --> 14:07.681
It must be in the capital.

14:09.474 --> 14:10.684
Brunel has predicted

14:10.851 --> 14:13.228
15 million bricks
for the building.

14:13.395 --> 14:16.398
Yes, well, we are expecting
thousands of visitors each day.

14:16.565 --> 14:18.358
We're going to need
an open space

14:18.525 --> 14:20.152
around the size of... Hyde Park!

14:21.903 --> 14:24.406
That, Mr. Cole,

14:24.573 --> 14:27.742
is a brilliant suggestion!

14:27.909 --> 14:33.039
<i>S'?</i>

14:33.206 --> 14:35.625
The nation's greatest park

14:35.792 --> 14:38.628
to be destroyed by a huge

14:38.795 --> 14:41.381
masonry edifice

14:41.548 --> 14:45.927
and polluted
by the detritus of society.

14:46.094 --> 14:49.347
We shall have to find
a design that is temporary.

14:49.514 --> 14:51.600
But strong enough to house
the entire contents

14:51.766 --> 14:53.477
of the world's manufacturing?

14:53.643 --> 14:55.020
It shall be a feat
of engineering

14:55.187 --> 14:57.022
such as the world
has never seen.

14:57.189 --> 15:01.776
I wonder if the prince has
considered where the drunkards

15:01.943 --> 15:03.236
shall relieve themselves?

15:05.864 --> 15:08.909
Look at these designs

15:09.075 --> 15:13.663
for what we might call
public conveniences.

15:13.830 --> 15:16.500
Trees that have stood there
for centuries

15:16.666 --> 15:19.336
will have to be cut down!

15:19.503 --> 15:22.172
Surely we can find a design
to incorporate them?

15:25.967 --> 15:27.594
I think we better open
submissions

15:27.761 --> 15:29.179
to every architect
in the country.

15:44.945 --> 15:46.238
This one looks like a cake.

15:46.404 --> 15:49.533
I think it's a Coburg loaf.

15:49.699 --> 15:51.159
Aren't I right, Papa?

15:51.326 --> 15:54.079
I thought the children
might like to see some designs

15:54.246 --> 15:56.498
for Albert's exhibition.

15:56.665 --> 15:58.625
Perhaps you might also care
to take a look, Drina?

16:00.377 --> 16:01.378
There you are.

16:01.545 --> 16:03.088
Show it to your mother.

16:03.255 --> 16:04.381
Look, Mama.

16:11.930 --> 16:13.223
I thought the intention

16:13.390 --> 16:15.100
was to celebrate Britain's
achievements,

16:15.267 --> 16:17.727
not to make it look ridiculous.

16:17.894 --> 16:19.539
Yes, well, Palmerston
has already seen to that.

16:19.563 --> 16:20.855
He's gone ahead,

16:21.022 --> 16:22.315
he's ignored Parliament

16:22.482 --> 16:24.192
and sent the gunboats already.

16:24.359 --> 16:28.113
Yes, well, I am due to speak
with him in a moment.

16:28.280 --> 16:30.156
It's too late.

16:31.575 --> 16:32.843
Well, you're the one
who's planning

16:32.867 --> 16:33.994
to humiliate the nation

16:34.160 --> 16:35.704
with this
giant gingerbread house!

16:35.870 --> 16:37.247
Drina!

16:37.414 --> 16:39.916
The exhibition will bring
together the finest

16:40.083 --> 16:42.002
in the arts...

16:44.337 --> 16:45.463
Come along, children.

16:55.724 --> 16:57.017
Was that really necessary?

16:57.183 --> 16:58.560
I think it's time
Feodora went home

16:58.727 --> 17:00.395
to her own family!

17:02.022 --> 17:04.024
Victoria, I can tolerate Bertie

17:04.190 --> 17:06.943
not wishing to share with Alfred
because he is a child.

17:08.653 --> 17:10.989
You are a 30-year-old woman,
who has still not learned

17:11.156 --> 17:12.532
how to play nicely.

17:12.699 --> 17:14.242
I am not a child, Albert!

17:14.409 --> 17:16.494
Well, stop behaving like one.

17:20.332 --> 17:25.003
<i>S'?</i>

17:27.922 --> 17:30.634
Your Majesty.

17:30.800 --> 17:33.219
I suppose I do not
have to explain to you,

17:33.386 --> 17:35.513
why I summoned you here.

17:35.680 --> 17:36.765
These curious bloomer suits

17:36.931 --> 17:39.559
that the American ladies
are wearing?

17:39.726 --> 17:40.810
Well, I give you my word

17:40.977 --> 17:42.288
that none shall reach
these shores

17:42.312 --> 17:43.563
while I am foreign secretary.

17:43.730 --> 17:46.149
Women in pantaloons indeed!

17:46.316 --> 17:49.152
Lord Palmerston,

17:49.319 --> 17:52.405
I did not give you my blessing
to order a naval blockade.

17:52.572 --> 17:53.782
But we did agree,

17:53.948 --> 17:55.426
we needed to find justice
for Don Pacifico.

17:55.450 --> 17:56.576
Yes, I assumed

17:56.743 --> 17:58.953
you would find
a peaceful solution.

17:59.120 --> 18:00.681
I didn't think
you would send in the navy

18:00.705 --> 18:01.915
for the sake of one man.

18:02.082 --> 18:03.541
I do not wish to alarm you,
ma'am,

18:03.708 --> 18:06.378
but Greece is getting ideas
above its station,

18:06.544 --> 18:09.214
and is support by Russia,
whose armed forces

18:09.381 --> 18:11.091
are set to eclipse ours
by Christmas.

18:11.257 --> 18:13.760
Then do you think it sensible
to provoke Russia like this?

18:13.927 --> 18:15.970
It's an overreaction,
it will surprise her.

18:16.137 --> 18:19.057
Yes, but the king of Greece
is Albert's cousin.

18:19.224 --> 18:22.185
Family are not always friends,
ma'am.

18:22.352 --> 18:23.937
Indeed.

18:29.984 --> 18:31.111
Lord Palmerston...

18:36.366 --> 18:38.076
May I ask you a question?
Certainly, ma'am.

18:39.744 --> 18:43.790
If force is not an option

18:43.957 --> 18:46.501
with which to surprise
your enemy,

18:46.668 --> 18:48.837
what other choices are there?

18:49.003 --> 18:51.005
You're the Queen of England,

18:51.172 --> 18:53.925
and you can't get rid
of your enemy by force?

18:54.092 --> 18:57.011
To do so would only damage
the alliance I want back.

18:59.013 --> 19:02.517
In that case, it might help to
turn your enemy into your ally.

19:04.978 --> 19:09.858
<i>S'?</i>

19:21.786 --> 19:23.955
What's making you smile,
Duchess?

19:24.122 --> 19:26.124
It's from William.

19:26.291 --> 19:28.585
He's arriving
at the end of the week.

19:28.752 --> 19:31.546
Be careful not to get
too excited, my dear.

19:33.298 --> 19:37.761
You've seemed rather...
frenzied of late.

19:37.927 --> 19:41.306
I do hope that your duties
to the queen aren't proving

19:41.473 --> 19:44.309
too much for your nerves.

19:44.476 --> 19:49.355
<i>S'?</i>

19:55.111 --> 19:56.446
You summoned me?

20:02.243 --> 20:04.412
Is someone joining you?

20:04.579 --> 20:05.705
You.

20:07.332 --> 20:10.710
Would you be so kind?

20:25.266 --> 20:29.646
I know relations between us
have been... trying.

20:29.813 --> 20:35.276
But we are sisters after all.

20:35.443 --> 20:38.404
I think it's time
we put the past behind us.

20:38.571 --> 20:39.731
You believe it's that simple?

20:44.577 --> 20:45.846
Perhaps I've not been
as generous

20:45.870 --> 20:47.080
as I ought to have been.

20:47.247 --> 20:49.624
Our lives are very unequal,
after all.

20:54.379 --> 20:55.797
Is there something
I can offer you,

20:55.964 --> 20:59.217
a token of my goodwill?

21:01.427 --> 21:02.637
Something?

21:04.847 --> 21:05.974
Anything-

21:09.477 --> 21:10.603
I want my daughter.

21:15.441 --> 21:18.903
Now she's 16, I believe
it's time she came to court.

21:19.070 --> 21:21.239
Your daughter?

21:21.406 --> 21:22.907
Yeah.

21:23.074 --> 21:26.077
I don't suppose
you remember her name.

21:34.460 --> 21:39.007
<i>S'?</i>

21:44.721 --> 21:46.973
He knows.

21:47.140 --> 21:48.516
He doesn't frighten me.

21:48.683 --> 21:50.083
You don't know
what he's capable of.

21:50.184 --> 21:51.477
He could destroy you, Joseph.

21:51.644 --> 21:53.938
I know that were he
to find out about us,

21:54.105 --> 21:56.858
he wouldn't want anyone to know.

21:57.025 --> 21:59.027
That's why the
Duke at Chatsworth paid me off.

22:00.153 --> 22:01.863
For what?

22:05.992 --> 22:07.076
Let me explain.

22:07.243 --> 22:09.412
I understand. Sophie.

22:09.579 --> 22:12.498
I should have been
protecting myself, not you.

22:12.665 --> 22:13.791
Sophie!

22:33.645 --> 22:36.689
Why are the newspapers
so shortsighted?

22:36.856 --> 22:41.694
Can they not see the benefits
the exhibition will bring?

22:41.861 --> 22:43.821
People are scared
of anything ambitious.

22:43.988 --> 22:45.828
And, of course,
it is a very costly enterprise.

22:45.990 --> 22:48.868
The costs,
they shall be recouped,

22:49.035 --> 22:50.870
a thousand times over.

22:51.037 --> 22:52.789
Only if the exhibition's
a success, sir.

22:54.624 --> 22:56.084
Which, of course, it will be.

22:58.586 --> 23:01.964
Has any suitable designs
come in?

23:04.092 --> 23:07.929
None yet that suit
our financial situation, sir.

23:09.639 --> 23:10.765
Right.

23:15.978 --> 23:18.231
You've seen what
they're saying in papers.

23:18.398 --> 23:21.442
Finally we have
an opportunity to...

23:21.609 --> 23:22.819
Sir Charles!

23:22.985 --> 23:24.112
La bouchere!

23:26.364 --> 23:28.449
I wonder what matters of trade

23:28.616 --> 23:30.135
you have to discuss
with the prime minister

23:30.159 --> 23:31.953
that do not concern
the foreign secretary.

23:32.120 --> 23:33.955
Is it so difficult
to believe we've matters

23:34.122 --> 23:35.873
to discuss that
don't involve you?

23:39.419 --> 23:41.045
I thought lying
was a basic skill

23:41.212 --> 23:43.089
for any prime minister.

23:43.256 --> 23:48.302
And I always thought
diplomacy was a basic skill

23:48.469 --> 23:51.848
for a foreign secretary, and yet
your handling of this affair

23:52.014 --> 23:54.308
in Greece has provoked
condemnation

23:54.475 --> 23:57.228
from both France and Russia.

23:57.395 --> 23:58.521
Good day.

24:00.606 --> 24:01.733
Good day.

24:03.234 --> 24:05.153
Disgrace...

24:09.574 --> 24:14.454
<i>S'?</i>

24:38.352 --> 24:42.607
Emma, you are old friends
with Palmerston, are you not?

24:42.774 --> 24:45.276
Do you really believe
he will survive this?

24:45.443 --> 24:49.197
I believe he is a man who enjoys
flying too close to the sun.

24:50.782 --> 24:52.742
That's true.

24:52.909 --> 24:55.203
He is resilient.

24:55.369 --> 24:57.246
I wish I could say the same
of the prince.

24:57.413 --> 25:00.833
He's working so hard
on this exhibition.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.628
He will prove his critics wrong
I am sure.

25:03.795 --> 25:05.463
Hmm...

25:05.630 --> 25:06.756
I hope so.

25:08.716 --> 25:10.760
I wish I could be sure
he was doing the right thing.

25:13.095 --> 25:15.073
I couldn't bear for all that
effort to go to waste.

25:15.097 --> 25:19.519
No man likes to be told
he is wrong, ma'am.

25:19.685 --> 25:23.481
But you could distract him.

25:25.858 --> 25:29.612
If we have 30
countries exhibiting...

25:29.779 --> 25:33.407
We will need an area
of at least...

25:33.574 --> 25:35.827
500,000 square feet.

25:35.993 --> 25:38.913
And the problem that we have
is it will take years

25:39.080 --> 25:41.415
to build something of this scale

25:41.582 --> 25:43.644
with all of the stone and brick
that has being proposed.

25:43.668 --> 25:45.086
Yes...

25:45.253 --> 25:48.548
It is imperative we find
a design with light material.

25:50.842 --> 25:52.635
So if the building

25:52.802 --> 25:58.516
is to begin there and would
reach beyond those trees...

25:58.683 --> 26:01.143
Indeed, sir.

26:01.310 --> 26:02.395
Way beyond the trees.

26:02.562 --> 26:08.568
<i>S'?</i>

26:14.740 --> 26:18.119
Good afternoon,
Your Royal Highness.

26:18.286 --> 26:19.537
Lord Palmerston.

26:19.704 --> 26:21.664
May I ask what you're doing,
sir?

26:21.831 --> 26:25.293
We are marking out the perimeter
of the exhibition.

26:25.459 --> 26:27.503
Ah...

26:27.670 --> 26:29.213
I admire your tenacity.

26:29.380 --> 26:31.757
Yes, well, I have learned
not to pay too much heed

26:31.924 --> 26:33.217
to public opinion.

26:33.384 --> 26:35.224
Spoken by a man
who has never had to rely on it

26:35.386 --> 26:36.512
to keep his position.

26:38.598 --> 26:40.933
Well, you don't seem worried
about yours, Lord Palmerston,

26:41.100 --> 26:42.435
considering the circumstances.

26:42.602 --> 26:46.355
Well, perhaps I should become
a novelist instead.

26:46.522 --> 26:48.162
Both professions
are just telling stories.

26:48.274 --> 26:49.567
The difference is,

26:49.734 --> 26:52.820
novelists are writing fiction,

26:52.987 --> 26:56.198
politicians...

26:56.365 --> 26:58.034
telling lies.

26:58.200 --> 27:00.400
And the similarity is that
people will believe any story

27:00.494 --> 27:01.495
if it's told well enough.

27:01.662 --> 27:02.872
Good day, sir.

27:06.459 --> 27:07.585
Good day.

27:08.920 --> 27:11.672
Although they are
very big shoes,

27:11.839 --> 27:15.676
or should I say boots, to fill,

27:15.843 --> 27:17.363
I was wondering
if you had any thoughts

27:17.511 --> 27:19.513
as to your successor.

27:19.680 --> 27:22.725
Mm... not an easy role to fill.

27:24.060 --> 27:25.436
Need someone rational,

27:25.603 --> 27:27.939
responsible, considered.

27:28.105 --> 27:32.360
It seems to me, Albert has all
of those qualities in abundance.

27:32.526 --> 27:35.613
I think it would be a great
use of his talents,

27:35.780 --> 27:38.324
and perhaps better than
the exhibition.

27:38.491 --> 27:42.161
Ah, yes.

27:42.328 --> 27:44.330
In battle,
We call that feinting.

27:44.497 --> 27:46.707
Feinting?
Distracting the attacker

27:46.874 --> 27:49.543
so that they do not enter
the fray at a point

27:49.710 --> 27:51.504
that could be catastrophic.

27:53.381 --> 27:56.008
If you mean do I want
to protect Albert from harm,

27:56.175 --> 27:58.803
then yes.

28:12.525 --> 28:13.651
Your Grace.

28:13.818 --> 28:16.320
Why do you call me "Your Grace"?

28:18.155 --> 28:20.783
Old habits.

28:20.950 --> 28:22.952
Of going after duchesses?

28:26.038 --> 28:28.332
I am not proud
of what I've done.

28:32.420 --> 28:35.006
If we run away together,

28:35.172 --> 28:37.258
lwill get nothing.

28:37.425 --> 28:40.302
We will be penniless.

28:40.469 --> 28:43.014
Caroline Norton's husband
took everything away from her

28:43.180 --> 28:46.600
when she tried to divorce him.

28:46.767 --> 28:48.811
Perhaps the prospect
is no longer so enticing.

28:53.107 --> 28:54.233
Sophie...

28:57.862 --> 28:59.655
I will be a rich man

28:59.822 --> 29:01.532
with you by my side.

29:02.783 --> 29:04.326
At Chatsworth

29:04.493 --> 29:06.203
I pretended to love someone.

29:06.370 --> 29:09.165
I wanted to make something
of myself.

29:09.331 --> 29:11.876
But all I want...

29:12.710 --> 29:14.045
is to wake up

29:14.211 --> 29:16.922
beside you every morning...

29:22.303 --> 29:25.765
And not feel as though
I am committing a crime.

29:28.684 --> 29:34.523
<i>S'?</i>

29:48.162 --> 29:49.246
Albert?

29:49.413 --> 29:51.123
Albert.

29:53.417 --> 29:55.920
I have something important
to tell you.

30:02.551 --> 30:06.263
Wellington wants you to succeed
him as commander-in-chief.

30:06.430 --> 30:08.099
And I agree.

30:10.309 --> 30:11.435
Commander-in-chief?

30:11.602 --> 30:13.187
Yes.

30:13.354 --> 30:14.688
Finally a chance, Albert,

30:14.855 --> 30:16.083
to show your country
you're worthy

30:16.107 --> 30:17.274
of their respect.

30:17.441 --> 30:18.526
Well, the exhibition

30:18.692 --> 30:20.361
will show them that,
will it not?

30:20.528 --> 30:22.947
Nothing like this
has ever been done before.

30:25.616 --> 30:30.287
Because the crown and commerce
are not natural allies,

30:30.454 --> 30:31.956
if it is not successful...

30:37.253 --> 30:40.005
Albert, you know what
the papers are saying.

30:40.172 --> 30:46.595
Victoria, this, this is
my chance to prove myself.

30:46.762 --> 30:48.889
Do you really think
I have the time

30:49.056 --> 30:50.599
to be commander-in-chief?

30:54.728 --> 30:56.897
Just wanted to do something
for you.

31:00.317 --> 31:05.197
<i>S'?</i>

31:27.803 --> 31:28.929
Good evening, Your Majesty.

31:32.266 --> 31:34.185
If you have summoned me here
to berate me,

31:34.351 --> 31:35.603
you needn't have bothered.

31:35.769 --> 31:37.438
I've had quite enough
of that today.

31:37.605 --> 31:38.731
Oh...

31:42.026 --> 31:45.613
Seems you've lost your knack
at pleasing the public.

31:45.779 --> 31:47.619
It'll take more
than a few unfriendly headlines

31:47.781 --> 31:49.158
to get rid of me, ma'am.

31:51.035 --> 31:53.287
I hope so.

31:53.454 --> 31:54.997
Really?

31:55.164 --> 31:56.248
Yes.

31:56.415 --> 31:59.627
I find that, despite everything,

31:59.793 --> 32:02.379
I value your advice.

32:05.633 --> 32:08.302
I am honored.

32:08.469 --> 32:12.848
Did you succeed in turning
an opponent into an ally?

32:14.767 --> 32:17.978
Let us say that
I've made an advance.

32:23.234 --> 32:27.112
<i>S'?</i>

32:32.576 --> 32:33.911
Where have you been?

32:34.078 --> 32:36.997
Why are you awake?

32:40.918 --> 32:44.421
I spoke to Feodora today.

32:44.588 --> 32:47.132
She's going to bring Heidi over.

32:47.299 --> 32:48.425
Heidi?

32:50.344 --> 32:52.096
Her daughter.

32:52.263 --> 32:55.724
I just wanted to do something
for my sister.

32:59.979 --> 33:01.272
Albert?

33:02.731 --> 33:03.857
Albert?

33:09.363 --> 33:14.285
<i>S'?</i>

33:14.451 --> 33:18.205
I'm so looking forward
to meeting my niece.

33:18.372 --> 33:19.372
Adelheid, you mean.

33:20.291 --> 33:22.626
Yes, Adelheid.

33:24.962 --> 33:29.300
I hope to help Adelheid
in any way I can.

33:29.466 --> 33:31.927
Though I don't seem to be

33:32.094 --> 33:34.305
good at helping anyone
at the moment.

33:37.683 --> 33:39.643
What's she like, Feodora?

33:44.982 --> 33:47.651
She's hopeful...

33:47.818 --> 33:49.987
carefree...

33:50.154 --> 33:51.280
spirited.

33:52.448 --> 33:54.575
Just like I was at that age;

33:54.742 --> 33:58.495
Before Mama banished me
to Langenburg.

34:03.917 --> 34:07.713
Well, if it's any consolation,
Mama always made me feel

34:07.880 --> 34:10.966
like she would rather be
somewhere else

34:11.133 --> 34:12.718
than in my company.

34:14.053 --> 34:15.488
And yet still
she made you feel guilty

34:15.512 --> 34:17.431
for not showing her
enough affection.

34:23.020 --> 34:26.690
Albert thinks I should put
my childhood behind me.

34:32.404 --> 34:33.530
Perhaps we both can.

34:37.201 --> 34:41.163
<i>S'?</i>

34:41.330 --> 34:43.665
You would think that by
now we would have found a design

34:43.832 --> 34:46.293
that represented
what we are trying to do,

34:46.460 --> 34:49.838
but...
this looks like a mausoleum.

34:51.924 --> 34:54.593
We want to celebrate
the union of art and industry,

34:54.760 --> 34:57.429
not bury it.

34:57.596 --> 35:01.683
If we don't start building now,
we won't be ready in time.

35:01.850 --> 35:06.021
Well, then perhaps our failure
to come up with the right design

35:06.188 --> 35:08.440
is a sign, Mr. Cole.

35:10.067 --> 35:13.195
Signs are for
the superstitious, sir.

35:17.908 --> 35:23.247
<i>S'?</i>

35:59.575 --> 36:00.742
Palmerston.

36:00.909 --> 36:03.078
Russell.

36:11.837 --> 36:13.130
Let me begin by asking:

36:15.048 --> 36:18.010
What does it mean to be a
citizen of this great nation?

36:20.846 --> 36:23.807
What does it mean
to be an Englishman?

36:25.392 --> 36:28.020
Is it a question of birth?
Locafion?

36:29.146 --> 36:30.481
Dress?

36:30.647 --> 36:34.026
By none of these criteria
could Don Pacifico

36:34.193 --> 36:35.903
be called an Englishman,

36:36.069 --> 36:37.905
but I believe

36:38.071 --> 36:41.241
that to be a subject
of Her Majesty the Queen

36:41.408 --> 36:42.659
means so much more

36:42.826 --> 36:45.412
than any of these things.

37:01.887 --> 37:03.527
The builders have increased
their estimate

37:03.555 --> 37:05.224
by £10,000.

37:05.390 --> 37:06.850
Which we do not have.

37:07.017 --> 37:09.269
We could make
the building smaller,

37:09.436 --> 37:10.938
cut down the number
of countries?

37:11.104 --> 37:14.399
Then the whole point
of the project would be lost.

37:14.566 --> 37:17.611
It is meant to be
a great exhibition.

37:17.778 --> 37:20.405
I think it still
will be great, sir,

37:20.572 --> 37:22.699
just on a smaller scale.

37:22.866 --> 37:25.827
I think the only thing that is
going to be great, Cole...

37:28.539 --> 37:31.166
will be my humiliation.

37:31.333 --> 37:34.586
The British citizen,
like the Roman, in days of old,

37:34.753 --> 37:36.380
held himself free
from indignity,

37:36.547 --> 37:37.798
when he could also say,

37:37.965 --> 37:40.551
<i>"Civis Romanus sum;"</i>

37:40.717 --> 37:44.596
so also the British subject,
shall feel confident

37:44.763 --> 37:47.349
that the watchful eye
and strong arm

37:47.516 --> 37:48.934
of England,

37:49.101 --> 37:51.562
shall protect him
from injustice and wrong,

37:51.728 --> 37:53.438
in whatever land he may be.

38:01.530 --> 38:04.533
<i>S'?</i>

38:04.700 --> 38:06.660
Papa! Papa!
We have something to show you.

38:06.827 --> 38:07.911
Look!

38:08.078 --> 38:09.955
Here it says,

38:10.122 --> 38:12.624
sh... sh... sh...

38:12.791 --> 38:14.960
It says shame about
your exhibition, Papa.

38:15.127 --> 38:16.753
Children!

38:16.920 --> 38:19.172
Leave your father in peace.

38:23.468 --> 38:24.595
Albert.

38:26.638 --> 38:28.278
What is it you wanted
to talk to me about?

38:29.975 --> 38:31.255
I have been offered the position

38:31.310 --> 38:33.812
of commander-in-chief.

38:33.979 --> 38:35.355
Oh!

38:36.898 --> 38:39.151
Well, there is no one
who would do better.

38:40.694 --> 38:42.904
Well, I think there are many
people who could

38:43.071 --> 38:45.115
command the army
with distinction,

38:45.282 --> 38:47.993
but I, I, lam the only man

38:48.160 --> 38:50.287
who could bring the exhibition
to life.

38:50.454 --> 38:51.663
The exhibition

38:51.830 --> 38:55.167
is a dream, a marvelous one,
but...

38:55.334 --> 38:59.963
Do you think it is time that I,
uh...

39:00.130 --> 39:01.465
woke up?

39:03.216 --> 39:04.760
Perhaps I should.

39:10.307 --> 39:15.187
<i>S'?</i>

39:22.444 --> 39:24.279
So he refused the position

39:24.446 --> 39:26.657
of commander-in-chief?

39:26.823 --> 39:28.200
That's extraordinary.

39:28.367 --> 39:29.719
I thought he would have leapt
at the chance

39:29.743 --> 39:30.952
of reorganizing the army.

39:31.119 --> 39:34.081
No, he thought the exhibition
more important.

39:34.247 --> 39:36.958
Rather like you putting
the defense of Don Pacifico

39:37.125 --> 39:38.210
before your career.

39:40.754 --> 39:42.881
Pam! Pam! Pam, sir!

39:44.633 --> 39:47.260
I think you overestimate
my integrity, ma'am.

39:47.427 --> 39:49.846
Nothing,
not even a naval blockade,

39:50.013 --> 39:52.057
comes between me and the people.

39:52.224 --> 39:54.226
I knew they'd come round
to my way of thinking.

39:54.393 --> 39:56.895
Oh, and besides, we did get to
teach the Russians a lesson

39:57.062 --> 39:58.689
without even firing a shot.

40:01.525 --> 40:02.984
God save you, Your Majesty.

40:03.151 --> 40:06.738
How did you know
they would come round?

40:06.905 --> 40:10.075
Every paper was predicting
your downfall.

40:10.242 --> 40:13.328
I tend not put too much stock
in what the papers say, ma'am.

40:13.495 --> 40:18.667
<i>S'?</i>

40:25.674 --> 40:26.758
Your Majesty.

40:26.925 --> 40:28.051
Mr. Cole.

40:31.138 --> 40:32.264
Is something the matter?

40:35.058 --> 40:36.494
I came because there was
still one architect

40:36.518 --> 40:38.270
I wanted the prince to meet.

40:38.437 --> 40:40.917
But he has informed me that he
will be too busy with his duties

40:40.981 --> 40:43.483
as commander-in-chief
to carry on with the exhibition.

40:45.110 --> 40:47.195
But he turned it down.

40:47.362 --> 40:49.656
That was when he still had faith
in the exhibition, ma'am.

40:49.823 --> 40:52.701
But he no longer believes
he can win over the public.

40:54.953 --> 40:57.581
It seems to me the public
are won over by resolve.

40:57.748 --> 40:59.666
If you believe in something
firmly enough,

40:59.833 --> 41:02.043
they will too.

41:02.210 --> 41:04.129
I feel responsible, ma'am.

41:04.296 --> 41:06.757
If the prince has been
discouraged, Mr. Cole,

41:06.923 --> 41:08.842
<i>you</i> are not to blame.

41:09.009 --> 41:11.470
Excuse me.

41:11.636 --> 41:12.929
I believe
ma'am, that the prince,

41:13.096 --> 41:15.182
has taken a stroll
around the gardens.

41:15.348 --> 41:16.475
Thank you.

41:18.852 --> 41:25.609
<i>S'?</i>

41:39.206 --> 41:41.458
William has come home early.

41:41.625 --> 41:42.834
Will you send for my carriage?

41:44.795 --> 41:47.380
Remember, Sophie,

41:47.547 --> 41:50.467
what I said about America,

41:50.634 --> 41:52.344
I meant it.

41:52.511 --> 41:53.929
Of course.

41:54.095 --> 41:56.556
But first I need to see my son.

41:56.723 --> 41:57.849
It's been too long.

42:07.567 --> 42:08.693
Albert!

42:11.446 --> 42:13.114
Albert, wait!

42:14.699 --> 42:15.826
Albert!

42:16.743 --> 42:21.832
<i>S'?</i>

42:24.084 --> 42:26.545
I never should have offered you
that stupid position.

42:27.712 --> 42:29.923
You were right.

42:30.090 --> 42:31.967
You were right about all of it.
No!

42:32.133 --> 42:33.260
No, Albert!

42:36.012 --> 42:39.349
I married a dreamer,

42:39.516 --> 42:40.642
not a soldier.

42:42.185 --> 42:43.979
What if you married a failure?

42:47.858 --> 42:54.030
<i>S'?</i>

42:54.197 --> 42:56.575
Then I would be proud

42:56.741 --> 42:58.410
to have a husband
who was brave enough

42:58.577 --> 43:01.121
to fail at something
he believed in.

43:01.288 --> 43:06.459
<i>S'?</i>

43:27.272 --> 43:28.940
William!

43:29.649 --> 43:30.734
William?

43:30.901 --> 43:31.985
Mama!

43:32.152 --> 43:34.154
William! Hello, darling.

43:34.321 --> 43:35.530
Where are you taking him?

43:35.697 --> 43:36.781
Mama!

43:36.948 --> 43:38.033
What are you doing?

43:38.199 --> 43:39.451
My instructions, Duchess.

43:39.618 --> 43:40.702
Mama!

43:40.869 --> 43:41.869
William!

43:41.995 --> 43:43.872
Come along. Mama!

43:44.039 --> 43:48.585
I'd like to introduce you
to Dr. Shepard and Dr. Payne

43:48.752 --> 43:50.420
from the Sussex Lunatic Asylum.

43:50.587 --> 43:54.674
They're here to examine
and certify you as a lunatic.

43:54.841 --> 43:57.010
What other possible explanation
could there be

43:57.177 --> 43:58.970
for your behavior?

43:59.137 --> 44:00.221
Get off!

44:00.388 --> 44:02.223
Get off me!

44:02.390 --> 44:03.868
Get your hands off me!
What are you doing?

44:03.892 --> 44:06.478
Get off me! How dare you!

44:06.645 --> 44:08.063
You have no right!

44:08.229 --> 44:09.648
You have no right to do this!

44:09.814 --> 44:12.651
You are mistaken, my dear.

44:12.817 --> 44:16.237
It is my sad duty
to protect you from yourself.

44:19.282 --> 44:20.659
Get off!

44:20.825 --> 44:24.871
<i>S'?</i>

44:33.755 --> 44:37.217
Your Majesty,
Your Royal Highness,

44:37.384 --> 44:39.386
this is Mr. Paxton,

44:39.552 --> 44:41.054
who works for
the Duke of Devonshire

44:41.221 --> 44:42.389
as head gardener.

44:42.555 --> 44:43.950
The queen felt
that given his background,

44:43.974 --> 44:45.725
we'd do better meeting
in the open air.

44:45.892 --> 44:47.161
What an honor to be here,
Your Majesty,

44:47.185 --> 44:48.436
Your Royal Highness.

44:48.603 --> 44:50.313
Well, thank you for coming,
Mr. Paxton,

44:50.480 --> 44:51.773
but unless you came with a plan

44:51.940 --> 44:53.692
for a building
that is temporary,

44:53.858 --> 44:55.360
will not kill the trees,

44:55.527 --> 44:57.207
and can be built within
a couple of months,

44:57.320 --> 44:59.322
then I really feel
we will be wasting your time.

44:59.489 --> 45:01.616
What the prince means,
Mr. Paxton,

45:01.783 --> 45:03.368
is it is a challenge.

45:03.535 --> 45:06.079
But Mr. Cole assures me that
if there is any man for the job,

45:06.246 --> 45:08.748
it is you.
Thank you, Your Majesty.

45:08.915 --> 45:11.876
Because I rather attribute
my own success to yourself.

45:13.169 --> 45:14.004
Or, to be more specific,

45:14.170 --> 45:16.214
the Victoria Amazonia lily.

45:16.381 --> 45:17.841
You see,

45:18.008 --> 45:20.468
when the duke entrusted me
to cultivate the seeds

45:20.635 --> 45:23.346
of this exotic flower,
it grew so large

45:23.513 --> 45:26.766
that I was able to balance
my own little girl on it.

45:26.933 --> 45:29.644
Weren't you scared she'd drown?

45:29.811 --> 45:31.730
Oh, I assure you
it was quite safe.

45:31.896 --> 45:34.691
The plants are
surprisingly strong.

45:34.858 --> 45:38.611
Like these lilies,
the secret is in the rigidity

45:38.778 --> 45:40.947
provided by the radiating ribs

45:41.114 --> 45:42.949
connecting with
flexible cross-ribs.

45:43.116 --> 45:47.829
The Victoria Amazonia lily
grew so large,

45:47.996 --> 45:51.082
that I had to design a new
greenhouse on a grand scale

45:51.249 --> 45:53.418
to fit it;
My design was inspired

45:53.585 --> 45:56.171
by structure of the leaves
themselves.

45:56.337 --> 45:58.798
Was it expensive?

45:58.965 --> 46:00.800
Not now that the tax
on glass has gone.

46:00.967 --> 46:02.969
And was it easy to build?

46:03.136 --> 46:04.947
Ah, it didn't take more
than a couple of months.

46:04.971 --> 46:06.806
And can it be taken down?

46:06.973 --> 46:08.433
I haven't tried it yet,

46:08.600 --> 46:11.311
but, uh... it should be easy.

46:11.478 --> 46:12.604
What about the trees?

46:12.771 --> 46:14.248
Would they be able
to survive inside of it?

46:14.272 --> 46:15.899
Oh, Papa,

46:16.066 --> 46:19.194
it's a conservatory,
it's what it's designed for!

46:19.360 --> 46:21.404
Ah, well, in that case,
Mr. Paxton,

46:21.571 --> 46:23.907
I, I think these lilies
may provide further assistance

46:24.074 --> 46:25.408
to your career.

46:25.575 --> 46:27.428
Would you be able to build
your, your conservatory

46:27.452 --> 46:31.247
on an even larger scale,
big enough to house

46:31.414 --> 46:34.626
the entire contents
of the world's manufacturing?

46:36.127 --> 46:38.588
A greenhouse to the gods.

46:40.340 --> 46:41.883
A Crystal Palace.

46:45.553 --> 46:48.139
I remember how ready I felt
for my coronation.

46:49.641 --> 46:51.976
Now I see how unprepared I was.

46:54.521 --> 46:58.274
I never doubted you
for a moment, ma'am.

47:00.568 --> 47:03.404
I was fortunate to have
wise minds

47:03.571 --> 47:05.824
who believed in me when...

47:05.990 --> 47:07.117
when I could not.

47:10.328 --> 47:14.374
I never had a daughter, ma'am,

47:14.541 --> 47:17.877
but if I had, I like to think

47:18.044 --> 47:20.588
she would have been
something like you.

47:22.132 --> 47:23.591
I never had a father.

47:27.137 --> 47:29.013
Butl...

47:29.180 --> 47:32.142
think I know what it feels
to lose one.

47:43.361 --> 47:45.530
Stick to your guns, ma'am.

47:45.697 --> 47:47.782
When you reach my age,
you will realize

47:47.949 --> 47:53.329
there's no point getting
sentimental about endings.

47:53.496 --> 47:58.459
<i>S'?</i>

48:18.688 --> 48:20.773
<i>Hop, hop, hop, sketch, hop.</i>

48:26.196 --> 48:29.199
<i>S'?</i>

48:46.049 --> 48:47.175
Oh, Mama!

49:01.689 --> 49:02.690
Children,

49:02.857 --> 49:05.693
this is your cousin Adelheid.

49:10.573 --> 49:13.243
Welcome to Buckingham Palace,
cousin Adelheid.

49:15.286 --> 49:16.871
Oh, please call me Heidi.

49:19.916 --> 49:22.043
Come, Heidi.

49:30.718 --> 49:31.803
It's your turn.

49:31.970 --> 49:33.096
Oh.

49:40.895 --> 49:42.289
This morning I received
yet another report

49:42.313 --> 49:44.399
that every anarchist in Europe

49:44.565 --> 49:45.817
is intending to come

49:45.984 --> 49:49.445
to the Great Exhibition.

49:49.612 --> 49:51.197
And you believe this

49:51.364 --> 49:54.158
to be true, Prime Minister?

49:54.325 --> 49:55.493
On this particular matter,

49:55.660 --> 49:58.871
I agree with
the foreign secretary.

49:59.038 --> 50:03.418
We were one of the only nations
to prevent revolution.

50:03.584 --> 50:04.853
And you now decide,
quite literally,

50:04.877 --> 50:06.004
to invite it in.

50:09.590 --> 50:11.718
Shall I begin the process

50:11.884 --> 50:13.386
of disinvitation,

50:13.553 --> 50:14.679
if such a word exists.

50:19.142 --> 50:20.268
No, I don't think so.

50:21.936 --> 50:23.438
You see, Lord Palmerston,

50:23.604 --> 50:28.860
you are not the only man
with a vision for this country.

50:29.027 --> 50:32.155
But my husband has vision
for a country that leads by...

50:35.325 --> 50:38.494
curiosity rather than
intimidation,

50:38.661 --> 50:41.497
competition
rather than conflict.

50:41.664 --> 50:47.086
Avision that trusts in the
very best part of human nature,

50:47.253 --> 50:48.379
not the worst.

50:50.548 --> 50:52.759
You put it so well, ma'am,

50:52.925 --> 50:57.430
but the public do not see the
exhibition in the same light.

50:57.597 --> 51:00.558
Well, as you know from recent
experience, Lord Palmerston,

51:00.725 --> 51:03.853
the public can change their mind
in an afternoon.

51:06.689 --> 51:08.316
Sounds as if your mind
is made up.

51:08.483 --> 51:09.776
It is.

51:18.576 --> 51:21.120
Congratulations on
your victory in Parliament,

51:21.287 --> 51:22.497
Lord Palmerston.

51:22.663 --> 51:25.041
Your Serene Highness,
how kind of you.

51:27.960 --> 51:30.588
You know, I could almost believe
we were friends.

51:30.755 --> 51:32.173
But your type
don't have friends,

51:32.340 --> 51:34.842
only allies.

51:35.009 --> 51:36.844
Can an ally ask for assistance?

51:39.389 --> 51:41.641
I have a daughter

51:41.808 --> 51:43.893
who is now
of a marriageable age.

51:44.060 --> 51:47.438
And you think I may know
some eligible young men?

51:47.605 --> 51:49.190
Oh, tell me,

51:49.357 --> 51:51.401
it wasn't by any chance
the queen's idea

51:51.567 --> 51:53.569
to invite your daughter?

51:53.736 --> 51:57.532
She has been most encouraging.

51:57.698 --> 51:58.825
Oh...

52:03.996 --> 52:05.415
Thank you.

52:06.999 --> 52:09.419
Only you could have known
what to say.

52:09.585 --> 52:11.754
You know me better than anyone.

52:14.674 --> 52:18.302
You know me better than anyone.

52:18.469 --> 52:20.263
That's why you've had enough.

52:20.430 --> 52:21.556
What?

52:25.226 --> 52:27.603
I've done everything I can
to make you love me again.

52:30.440 --> 52:32.150
I can't turn back time.

52:42.702 --> 52:44.203
What if...

52:46.164 --> 52:49.333
I loved you in a different way?

52:50.418 --> 52:51.544
What kind of different way?

52:53.087 --> 52:54.338
Well, it is ten years

52:54.505 --> 52:56.382
since we were married.

52:59.677 --> 53:01.512
We have changed.

53:05.766 --> 53:09.979
Perhaps our love has changed.

53:12.523 --> 53:14.901
But of course I love you.

53:22.617 --> 53:24.577
Well, I should think so.

53:24.744 --> 53:25.870
Mm-hmm.

53:27.955 --> 53:29.165
Albert!

53:29.332 --> 53:30.666
Albert, give that back!

53:30.833 --> 53:33.252
Wadsworth.

53:33.419 --> 53:34.587
I was reading that!

53:34.754 --> 53:36.756
<i>S'?</i>

53:49.644 --> 53:56.484
J " Gloriana J".

54:03.533 --> 54:10.289
J " Gloriana, hallelujah J"
