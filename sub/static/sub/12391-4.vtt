But how did I lose?

01:02.750 --> 01:04.752
My bike's twice
as good as his.

01:04.790 --> 01:06.655
Yeah, well you see,
that's the thing, Shawn.

01:06.700 --> 01:09.362
Sure, your bike looks great
with all these ridiculous

01:09.400 --> 01:11.709

years' worth of cereal box tops,

01:11.740 --> 01:15.449

on what's Important:

01:15.480 --> 01:16.777
hard work.

01:16.820 --> 01:20.551
I'm sorry son, but he just
out-pedaled you.

01:20.590 --> 01:21.682
Do you understand?

01:21.730 --> 01:23.459
I think so.

01:23.500 --> 01:25.388
[rings bell]

01:25.430 --> 01:26.294
(Shawn)
I got it!

01:26.340 --> 01:29.537
I had the wrong song
playing that time.

01:29.570 --> 01:30.935
Best two out of three.

what you're
trying to do, Shawn.

01:50.280 --> 01:51.247
And it's not gonna work.

01:51.290 --> 01:52.518
I'm not buying.

01:59.770 --> 02:02.238
Oh, it's on now.

02:07.780 --> 02:09.816
On three.

02:09.850 --> 02:10.817
One...

02:10.860 --> 02:12.259
two...

02:17.740 --> 02:19.002
Let go of my chair, Shawn.

02:19.040 --> 02:20.769
The wheels!
They're stuck together!

02:20.810 --> 02:23.677
[both yelling and crashing]

02:23.720 --> 02:25.608
Listen, you two...
(Shawn)
Did you see who won?

02:25.650 --> 02:26.617
I beat him, didn't I?

02:26.660 --> 02:27.615
No, no, no.
Two out of three.

02:27.660 --> 02:29.594
Ha, that means
I beat him, right?

02:29.630 --> 02:30.858
Unlike everyone else
around here,

02:30.900 --> 02:32.720
I'm not fooled
by the fact that you...

02:32.770 --> 02:33.896
wear grown-up clothes

02:33.940 --> 02:35.931
have mastered the rudimentary
levels of communication

02:35.970 --> 02:37.733
and, somehow,
manage to feed yourselves.

02:37.780 --> 02:39.577
I see you
for what you are:

02:39.610 --> 02:40.577
children.

02:40.620 --> 02:41.939
So do me a favor

02:41.990 --> 02:43.958
and let the grown-ups
do their work.

02:43.990 --> 02:47.551
I got a boo-boo.

02:47.600 --> 02:49.022
[sighs]

02:49.070 --> 02:50.867
Speaking of boo-boos,

02:50.900 --> 02:52.959
you wouldn't happen to have
any extra unsolved cases

02:53.010 --> 02:54.443
lying around, would you?

02:54.480 --> 02:56.539
Spencer, there is just
no easy way to tell you

02:56.580 --> 02:57.842
that I consider you
a waste

02:57.880 --> 03:00.348
of this department's
time and energy.

03:00.360 --> 03:01.759
Huh.

03:01.790 --> 03:03.655
I guess there was
an easy way.

03:03.700 --> 03:04.689
But actually I've got
less patience

03:04.730 --> 03:05.424
for you today than normal.

03:05.470 --> 03:07.768
See, I received an invitation

03:07.800 --> 03:10.633
to give a presentation
at 21-LES.

03:11.850 --> 03:14.410
let Century
Law Enforcement Seminar?

03:15.720 --> 03:17.483
(Shawn)
Yes.

03:17.520 --> 03:19.750
We know that better as
"21 Saint Cent-Les."

03:19.790 --> 03:21.894
I like to call it
21 Cent Law Info Semin.

03:21.930 --> 03:23.124
Go ahead...

03:23.170 --> 03:24.501
make jokes.

03:25.810 --> 03:26.879
But we just did.

03:28.580 --> 03:30.218
You see, kids,
I will be presenting

03:30.250 --> 03:32.912
the cutting edge
technology.

03:32.950 --> 03:35.020

for the new detective.

03:35.060 --> 03:36.789
We're talking back-scatter

03:38.800 --> 03:41.564

03:41.610 --> 03:43.737
That's weird.

03:43.780 --> 03:45.668
I could have sworn that I--

03:46.820 --> 03:48.742
I don't believe it.

03:48.790 --> 03:49.745
Don't believe what?

03:49.790 --> 03:50.757
My car, it's gone.

03:50.790 --> 03:52.826
It was right there.
It's--

03:52.860 --> 03:54.225
It's been stolen.

03:55.870 --> 03:58.862
Who would dare
steal my car?

03:58.910 --> 04:00.468
(Shawn)
Well, here's the good news.

04:00.480 --> 04:02.209
It'll make
for an amusmg anecdote

04:02.250 --> 04:05.014

at 21 Saint Cent-Les.

of "punking"?

would stoop so low

as to tamper with
police-issued property,

04:56.860 --> 04:58.680

the institution that is

04:58.730 --> 05:00.129

(Gus)
What, Shawn?

05:20.900 --> 05:21.901
What is it?

It's a _trace

05:24.140 --> 05:26.279
It's faint, but clear.

05:26.310 --> 05:27.277
You were recently somewhere

05:27.320 --> 05:28.412
where the security
of your car was compromised.

05:28.450 --> 05:31.010
I'm sensing someplace posh.

05:31.060 --> 05:33.119

05:33.160 --> 05:34.957

servant's salary.

restaurant last night.

one would take a date to?

back in the game?

whom I spend my personal time.

Now you have to dish.

05:51.300 --> 05:52.267

Yeah.

at that restaurant

06:12.210 --> 06:13.234
that led to your car
being stolen.

06:13.270 --> 06:15.306
I'm sensing red coats.

06:15.340 --> 06:17.319
And accents.

06:17.350 --> 06:19.318
The British?
No.

06:19.350 --> 06:20.510
The valets.

06:20.560 --> 06:21.549
Check the valet
departure car.

06:21.590 --> 06:23.455
He may have used the old

06:23.500 --> 06:25.422
"key in the putty" trick
to get an impression.

06:25.470 --> 06:27.893
Of course, that would have been
my first deduction,

06:27.940 --> 06:29.874
had I not been...

06:29.910 --> 06:33.505
overcoming this blatant
violation.

06:33.550 --> 06:34.847
I'm gonna get
right over there.

06:34.890 --> 06:36.414
No, oh.

06:47.110 --> 06:48.008
[door closing]

06:48.040 --> 06:50.042
Maybe we had a little
too much fun with him.

06:50.080 --> 06:52.241
[seat sliding]

06:52.290 --> 06:53.245
Maybe.

06:53.290 --> 06:54.314
[engine starting]

06:57.360 --> 06:58.463
I have to pee-pee.

07:04.910 --> 07:06.343
May I help you,
gentleman?

07:06.380 --> 07:08.348
The theft of police
property has occurred.

07:08.380 --> 07:10.416
I have reason to believe
the guilty party works here.

07:10.460 --> 07:11.518
Oh, dear.

07:11.560 --> 07:15.166
Well, rest assured you have
our complete cooperation.

07:15.200 --> 07:17.566
I only ask that you keep
your investigation under wraps.

07:17.600 --> 07:19.204
You know,
for appearance sake.

07:19.240 --> 07:20.332
Noted.

07:20.380 --> 07:22.200
Now, I'm gonna need to sequester
your main dinning room,

07:22.250 --> 07:24.070
interview your entire
valet staff,

07:24.120 --> 07:25.485
and possibly your busboys.

07:25.520 --> 07:27.454
One moment.

07:27.490 --> 07:29.378
Yeah, he's gonna be a problem.

07:29.430 --> 07:31.421
I don't know. _
He seemed pretty cooperative.

07:31.470 --> 07:32.391
Your work here is done.

07:32.430 --> 07:34.364
I'll get my car back
soon enough.

07:34.400 --> 07:35.367
Here.

07:35.410 --> 07:36.502
But I'm warning you,

07:36.540 --> 07:39.543
if word of this little incident
gets out of the station,

07:39.580 --> 07:42.515
I will start making things very
difficult for you down there.

07:44.260 --> 07:46.524
You're saying
you haven't even been trying?

07:46.560 --> 07:47.595
All this time?

07:47.630 --> 07:49.427
Good-bye.

07:54.580 --> 07:57.014
He's not gonna get anywhere
talking to those valets.

07:57.050 --> 07:58.517
They have
a very strict code.

07:58.550 --> 08:00.518
I still think you're
thinking about the British.

08:00.560 --> 08:02.380
May have to roll my sleeves
up for this one, Gus.

08:02.430 --> 08:04.694
Actually, I may have
to take off my entire shirt.

08:04.730 --> 08:06.129
Please don't.

08:07.800 --> 08:09.631
Oh, later.

08:13.210 --> 08:15.212
Hi there.

08:15.250 --> 08:16.478
My name is Shawn Spencer.

08:16.520 --> 08:17.350
I'm the head psychic

08:17.390 --> 08:18.288
for the Santa Barbara
police department.

08:18.320 --> 08:20.629
And I may need to get
a statement from you.

08:20.660 --> 08:22.025
More specifically,

08:22.070 --> 08:23.162
the word "yes."

08:23.200 --> 08:24.167
Nice try.

08:24.200 --> 08:25.508
But I reserve the right

08:25.540 --> 08:27.679
to refuse service
to anyone.

08:32.390 --> 08:33.789
That's all right.

08:33.820 --> 08:35.549
If my parents were visiting,

08:35.590 --> 08:37.490
I probably wouldn't
wanna waste time

08:37.530 --> 08:40.567
meeting handsome
new strangers either.

08:40.600 --> 08:42.534
Regardless of how smart

08:42.570 --> 08:44.174
or interesting
they might be.

08:44.210 --> 08:45.643
My parents are visiting.

08:45.680 --> 08:47.170
That was pretty impressive.

08:47.220 --> 08:48.369
You really are psychic.

08:48.420 --> 08:49.739
Sorry, I thought

08:49.790 --> 08:51.212
you were just hitting
on me.

08:51.260 --> 08:53.478
Oh, I'm actually
much more interested

08:53.530 --> 08:54.656
in going out
with your parents.

08:54.700 --> 08:56.565
_ _ I love the
Miniatures Museum.

08:56.600 --> 08:58.602
[both laughing]

08:58.640 --> 09:01.074
What was it
you needed to ask me about?

09:01.080 --> 09:04.641
Do you recall any uh...
suspicious behavior

09:04.680 --> 09:07.649
from any of the valets
on duty last night?

09:07.690 --> 09:08.509
Now that you mention it,

09:08.560 --> 09:10.118
we had a new guy
who started yesterday,

09:10.160 --> 09:11.491
but didn't show up this morning.

09:11.530 --> 09:12.326
Bingo.

09:12.370 --> 09:14.497
Gonna need a name
and a phone number.

09:14.540 --> 09:16.337
Of course.

09:16.370 --> 09:18.270
And then...

09:18.310 --> 09:21.143
I'll give you the information
about the valet.

09:25.890 --> 09:27.619
Get this.

09:27.660 --> 09:29.389
_The valet's number
is actually a number

09:29.430 --> 09:31.398
to a pay phone
outside of a warehouse.

09:31.440 --> 09:33.635
Yeah.

09:33.680 --> 09:35.375
I don't know.

09:35.410 --> 09:36.809
I don't know if it
looks like the warehouse

09:36.850 --> 09:38.317
from Blue City, Gus.

09:38.350 --> 09:40.659
You're the only one
that remembers that movie.

09:40.690 --> 09:41.952
What, are you insane?

09:41.990 --> 09:44.458
Way more people saw
From The Hip than Blue City--

09:44.500 --> 09:46.388
Look, I'm not gonna talk
Judd Nelson right now.

09:46.430 --> 09:47.328
No, just--

09:47.370 --> 09:48.803
just meet me at the station
in an hour.

09:48.840 --> 09:50.603
Thank you.

09:51.680 --> 09:53.443
A warehouse?
Sweet!

09:53.480 --> 09:55.289
There's always something
happening on the DL

09:55.320 --> 09:56.287
inside a warehouse.

09:56.320 --> 09:57.309
You staked it out, right?

09:57.360 --> 09:58.315
I know you staked it out.

09:58.360 --> 09:59.679
Oh, it got staked.

09:59.730 --> 10:01.197
Stook.

10:01.200 --> 10:03.896
Staken?

10:03.940 --> 10:05.362
Staked, right?

10:05.410 --> 10:06.365
Right.

10:06.410 --> 10:08.571
Yeah, yeah--
it got staked.

10:08.610 --> 10:09.804
You found out what happened
to Lassiter's car?

10:09.850 --> 10:11.340
A whole bunch of cars
go in,

10:11.380 --> 10:15.783
but only boxes full
of car parts come out.

10:15.830 --> 10:17.024
Dude, it's a chop shop.

10:17.060 --> 10:18.857
That's big.

10:18.900 --> 10:20.561
(Shawn)
Victims--
I see victims everywhere!

10:20.600 --> 10:23.262
It's horrible!

10:23.310 --> 10:25.437
Sawed-off parts
strewn about.

10:25.480 --> 10:27.619
Fluids spraying
in every direction.

10:27.650 --> 10:28.446
Oh, dear God!

10:28.480 --> 10:29.617
Are we talking about
a serial killer?

10:29.650 --> 10:31.288
I can see the victims' names.

10:31.320 --> 10:32.321
(Shawn)
Accord, look out!

10:32.360 --> 10:33.793
(Gus)
Get outta there!

10:33.830 --> 10:35.764
(Shawn)
Escalade, don't let him
in the door.

10:35.800 --> 10:37.563
Oh, Camry,

10:37.600 --> 10:38.862
you were too young to go!

10:38.910 --> 10:40.639
Are we talking about cars?

10:40.680 --> 10:42.875
Stolen cars?

10:42.910 --> 10:45.515
The signal's too strong.

10:45.550 --> 10:47.450
I'm getting "chop sticks."

10:47.490 --> 10:48.821
"Chopped salad?
What?

10:50.900 --> 10:52.788
.. Ah!
Chop suey?"

10:52.830 --> 10:53.797
Good God!

10:53.840 --> 10:55.831
"Wheelie and the Chopper Bunch."

10:55.870 --> 10:56.939
Does that mean anything
to you?

10:56.980 --> 11:00.108
"Wheelie and the Chopper Bunch."

11:00.150 --> 11:01.117
Chop shop!

11:01.150 --> 11:02.447
It's a chop shop.

11:02.490 --> 11:03.718
Yes!

11:03.750 --> 11:04.819
And--and I see a warehouse.

11:04.860 --> 11:07.090
And cargo containers.

11:07.130 --> 11:08.097
And a street sign.

11:08.130 --> 11:10.564
And a little mouse
named Algernon in a maze.

11:10.600 --> 11:11.567
Flower Street!

11:11.600 --> 11:12.669
(Vick)
Flower Street--

11:12.710 --> 11:13.677
that's down by the tracks.

11:13.710 --> 11:15.029
We better check this out.

11:15.080 --> 11:16.809
[sighs]

11:16.850 --> 11:18.715
You know you just bought that,
right?

11:24.030 --> 11:26.999
[woman's voice
over intercom]

11:39.830 --> 11:42.025
Looks like a slam dunk,
Mr. Spencer.

11:42.070 --> 11:43.492
Wally there
is the ringleader.

11:43.530 --> 11:44.792
And all the evidence we need
to take him down

11:44.840 --> 11:46.637
is right here.

11:46.670 --> 11:49.138
I mean, stolen parts,
serial numbers, shipment logs--

11:49.180 --> 11:50.204
you name it.

11:50.250 --> 11:51.615
No need to thank me,
Chief.

11:51.650 --> 11:53.015
Just glad to help.

11:53.050 --> 11:54.017
Mm.

11:54.060 --> 11:55.049
Don't thank him either.

11:55.090 --> 11:56.159
Well, if I can't thank you

11:56.190 --> 11:57.157
I can't pay you.

11:57.200 --> 11:58.155
Our pleasure.

11:58.200 --> 11:59.599
Oh, you're very welcome.

11:59.630 --> 12:00.995
You are.

12:01.040 --> 12:01.438
You know,
this ring was responsible

12:01.440 --> 12:03.863
for hundreds of car thefts

12:03.910 --> 12:05.002
around town.

12:05.040 --> 12:06.246
Wally had operatives
in places--

12:06.280 --> 12:08.214
mechanics, valets,
car wash attendants--

12:08.250 --> 12:10.081
all copying people's keys

12:10.120 --> 12:12.759
and then stealing their cars
from different locations.

12:12.790 --> 12:14.052
Does it say anything in there

12:14.090 --> 12:14.852
about them stealing
loose change

12:14.900 --> 12:16.868
or switching the presets
on radios?

12:16.900 --> 12:17.889
(Gus)
'Cause that happens to me

12:17.940 --> 12:18.895
all the time.

12:18.940 --> 12:20.032
Okay, Gus.

12:20.070 --> 12:22.049
Go ahead and put

12:22.080 --> 12:23.945
your aluminum foil hat
back on.

12:23.980 --> 12:25.743
I'm not paranoid, Shawn.
It happens.

12:25.790 --> 12:28.179
Anyway, I believe this is
a department record

12:28.220 --> 12:31.053
for_the fastest _bus_t ever
in a case this Size.

12:31.100 --> 12:32.965
Truly your most efficient work.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.629
[applause]

12:36.670 --> 12:39.104
Oh, stop.
That's so unnecessary.

12:39.150 --> 12:40.674
You know,

12:40.720 --> 12:42.984
I couldn't help but notice
that a certain vehicle

12:43.020 --> 12:45.750
belonging
to a certain head detective

12:45.790 --> 12:48.224
just happens
to not be here.

12:48.260 --> 12:50.569
Lassie, we had the boys
from crime scene

12:50.600 --> 12:51.806
move your car up the street

12:51.840 --> 12:54.035
right before you
and the Chief arrived.

12:54.080 --> 12:57.117
You're in the clear,
tiger.

12:57.150 --> 12:58.879
Thanks.

13:01.260 --> 13:03.854
Although...today
is a street sweeping day.

13:03.900 --> 13:06.061
Did we park on the east side
or the west side of the street?

13:06.100 --> 13:07.328
North side.
No, no, no.

13:07.370 --> 13:09.258
It wasn't
the north side.
Yes, it was.

13:09.300 --> 13:10.699
I'd know, Shawn.

13:10.740 --> 13:11.968
I'm good with directions.
You're not.

13:12.010 --> 13:13.773
Gus, you have the bearings
of a wounded bumblebee.

13:13.820 --> 13:17.210
Why would--

13:17.250 --> 13:18.751
Uh-oh.

13:18.790 --> 13:22.055
We need
to get out of here.

13:22.100 --> 13:23.067
(Chelsea)
Well, you're certainly

13:23.100 --> 13:24.294
a unique guy, Shawn.

13:24.340 --> 13:27.776
A guy who calls
the day he gets the number.

13:27.810 --> 13:29.209
And brings flowers.

13:29.240 --> 13:30.673
I stole the flowers.

13:30.720 --> 13:32.017
From table one.

13:32.050 --> 13:32.846
They're fake,

13:32.890 --> 13:34.858
and they smell vaguely
of creamy pesto,

13:34.890 --> 13:36.653
but I'm pretty sure
it's the thought that counts.

13:36.690 --> 13:38.692
[laughs]

13:38.730 --> 13:40.732
And you're good enough
to come and meet me here

13:40.770 --> 13:43.967
my last free night
before my parents arrive.

13:44.010 --> 13:47.138
Oh, wrapping up this case
was a lot easier than I thought.

13:47.180 --> 13:51.287
And this is one of the biggest
strawberries I've ever seen.

13:51.320 --> 13:53.379
Impressive.

13:53.430 --> 13:55.159
I've been here all day.

13:55.200 --> 13:57.760
So...what do you say
we take our dessert

13:57.800 --> 13:58.994
back to my place?

13:59.040 --> 14:00.064
I say yes.

14:04.250 --> 14:05.171
Was this too easy?

14:05.220 --> 14:07.211
I beg your pardon?

14:07.260 --> 14:09.751
Nothing.
I'm sorry.

14:09.790 --> 14:10.620
Never mind.

14:14.100 --> 14:17.172
I can't believe how quickly
I nailed this.

14:17.210 --> 14:20.373
Am I really this good?

14:20.410 --> 14:21.968
Excuse me?

14:22.020 --> 14:23.248
I mean,
is it possible that...

14:23.290 --> 14:25.781
no.

14:25.830 --> 14:27.525
No, nothing like this
has ever happened before.

14:27.560 --> 14:29.460
And nothing's going to happen
tonight either.

14:29.500 --> 14:32.469
How dare you think
that I'm easy?

14:32.500 --> 14:33.467
Good-bye.

14:33.510 --> 14:34.829
What--no.

14:34.880 --> 14:35.847
No, no, no.

14:35.880 --> 14:37.108
I'm not talking about you.

14:37.150 --> 14:39.118
This is--
this is something

14:39.150 --> 14:40.879
much worse.

14:40.920 --> 14:43.923
This is the first time
I've been wrong about a case.

14:46.940 --> 14:48.908
Gus, I'm telling you,
it was too easy.

14:48.940 --> 14:50.498
Why would this Wally guy
slip up

14:50.540 --> 14:52.269
by stealing
a detective's car

14:52.310 --> 14:53.277
from_ in front
of a police station?

14:53.310 --> 14:54.470
That doesn't make
any sense.

14:54.510 --> 14:56.387
Sure it does.
One of his guys got sloppy.

14:56.420 --> 14:57.216
Gus, I'm pretty sure

14:57.250 --> 14:59.059
I saw him smile
as they loaded him

14:59.090 --> 14:59.920
into the squad car.

14:59.960 --> 15:01.791
What, he thinks
going to prison is dope?

15:01.800 --> 15:03.324
No, come on.

15:03.370 --> 15:06.407
I think I solved the crime
I was supposed to solve.

15:06.440 --> 15:08.101
Not the crime
I should've solved.

15:08.140 --> 15:10.279
Okay, you're not making
any sense.

15:10.310 --> 15:12.414
And I happen to be busy,
so if you don't mind?

15:12.450 --> 15:13.417
What are you doing?

15:13.450 --> 15:14.849
What is_ this?
What, are you gomg somewhere?

15:14.890 --> 15:16.357
Yes, actually, I am.

15:16.390 --> 15:18.529
I finally have
a free weekend.

15:18.560 --> 15:21.461
Which means I get to use
the Spa Utopia package I won

15:21.500 --> 15:23.263
for being top sales rep.

15:23.310 --> 15:25.471
It comes complete
with town car and driver.

15:25.510 --> 15:26.875
Gus, you've been bragging
about that award

15:26.910 --> 15:28.343
for over a year--
why go now?

15:28.380 --> 15:29.244
Maybe I kept
pushing it back

15:29.280 --> 15:31.157
because I was always working
a second job.

15:31.190 --> 15:34.057
Like when I had to enter
a Civil War reenactment?

15:34.090 --> 15:35.591
Or when I was protecting
a sorority

15:35.630 --> 15:37.666
of pajama-clad coeds.

15:37.700 --> 15:39.406
You're actually complaining
about that?

15:39.440 --> 15:40.998
No, I'm not.

15:41.040 --> 15:43.042
But let's not forget about
the entire week I gave up

15:43.080 --> 15:44.911
riding shotgun to a cat,

15:44.950 --> 15:47.111
which, by the way,
was not a boy cat at all.

15:47.160 --> 15:48.388
That's some serious stress,
Shawn.

15:48.420 --> 15:50.479
I have to get
a deep-tissue massage

15:50.530 --> 15:52.998
to work out all the knots
in my back.

15:53.030 --> 15:54.930
I call the big one
"Little Shawn."

15:54.970 --> 15:56.699
[chuckles]

15:56.740 --> 15:58.435
Okay, that's the creepiest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

15:58.480 --> 15:59.504
They have a blind masseuse

15:59.550 --> 16:00.949
up there named Gloria.

16:00.980 --> 16:02.982
I hear she works wonders.
I can't wait.

16:03.020 --> 16:04.578
What is it with you
and the blind?

16:04.620 --> 16:07.692
I remember you went crazy
for that blind sculptor

16:07.730 --> 16:09.595
that did your bust.

16:09.630 --> 16:12.463
That was Lionel Richie
in the video for Hello.

16:12.510 --> 16:15.070
Great.

16:15.110 --> 16:16.748
Now I'm gonna have that song
stuck in my head.

16:16.780 --> 16:18.042
Good.

16:18.080 --> 16:19.479
Good-bye, Shawn.

16:24.090 --> 16:25.523
[clucks tongue]

16:25.560 --> 16:27.289
(Shawn)
Chief!

16:27.340 --> 16:29.228
We gotta reopen
the chop shop case.

16:29.270 --> 16:30.464
I'm pretty sure
we missed something.

16:30.510 --> 16:32.603
First of all,
"we" don't decide

16:32.650 --> 16:33.605
to reopen cases.

16:33.650 --> 16:34.617
I do.

16:34.650 --> 16:36.117
That's what I meant.

16:36.150 --> 16:37.651
Morning, Chief.
Morning.

16:37.690 --> 16:39.317
[remote entry beeps]

16:39.360 --> 16:42.227
Uh, Lassiter,
Mr. Spencer seems to think

16:42.270 --> 16:43.567
we might have missed something
in the chop shop case.

16:43.600 --> 16:45.739
No...no, that's
an open-and-shut case

16:45.770 --> 16:46.737
if ever I've seen one.

16:46.770 --> 16:48.271
(Vick)
Sorry, Mr. Spencer,

16:48.310 --> 16:49.299
but if you want
to reopen the case,

16:49.340 --> 16:50.307
you're gonna need
to come up

16:50.350 --> 16:52.147
with some concrete evidence.

16:52.190 --> 16:53.646
We don't devote
department resources

16:53.690 --> 16:56.488
to personal whims.

16:56.530 --> 16:57.758
Carlton, I finished
the PowerPoint slides

16:57.800 --> 17:00.689
for your 21-LES
presentation.

17:00.730 --> 17:03.267
_ _ This is... _
offICIal department busmess?

17:03.310 --> 17:04.277
Oh, you're right,

17:04.310 --> 17:05.504
Helvetica is
a much better font.

17:05.540 --> 17:07.269
I know--
see how the M

17:07.320 --> 17:09.845
in "double murder suicide"
just jumps off the page?

17:09.890 --> 17:11.585
Okay.
(Shawn)
Is there anyone left

17:11.620 --> 17:12.655
that I can actually speak to

17:12.690 --> 17:16.626
about this case?

17:16.670 --> 17:18.797
Like I said,
there's still...

17:18.840 --> 17:21.502
quite a few
unanswered questions.

17:21.540 --> 17:22.677
Well, what can I say?

17:22.710 --> 17:23.699
You guys got me
fair and square.

17:23.750 --> 17:24.774
That's just it.

17:24.820 --> 17:28.358
What kind of chop shop artist
steals a cop's car

17:28.390 --> 17:29.652
and doesn't chop it up?

17:29.690 --> 17:31.157
It's almost like you wanted
to leave a trail.

17:31.200 --> 17:33.760
Leave a trail,
don't leave a trail,

17:33.800 --> 17:34.824
wouldn't do any good.

17:34.870 --> 17:36.462
You guys caught me quick.
Snap!

17:38.210 --> 17:40.144
Cops are like, wham!
Miranda.

17:41.820 --> 17:45.187
Yeah, well,
there's still some questions.

17:45.220 --> 17:48.292
For instance, why haven't you
posted bail, Wally?

17:48.330 --> 17:49.354
Oh, it's all good.

17:49.400 --> 17:50.765
You know,
I'ma just do my time.

17:50.800 --> 17:51.767
With good behavior.

17:51.800 --> 17:53.904
And go on with my life.

17:53.940 --> 17:55.271
Till then, I'm like,
"My bad!"

17:55.310 --> 17:56.447
The court's like,
"Get in that cell."

17:56.480 --> 17:58.516
Justice.

17:58.550 --> 17:59.812
Okay.

17:59.850 --> 18:00.919
Let's try this again.

18:00.950 --> 18:03.623
(guard)
Prisoner 1906,

18:03.660 --> 18:04.684
visiting time is over.

18:04.730 --> 18:06.425
Gotta go.

18:29.710 --> 18:32.383
Your massage therapist
will be right with you,

18:32.420 --> 18:33.489
Mr. Guster.

18:33.520 --> 18:35.408
In the meantime,
please relax.

18:35.460 --> 18:36.882
And hydrate.

18:36.930 --> 18:38.818
Thank you.

18:38.860 --> 18:40.862
[exhales]

18:43.310 --> 18:44.299
Excuse me.

18:44.340 --> 18:46.342
Excuse me,
do you mind?

18:46.380 --> 18:47.517
Shawn,
what are you doing here?

18:47.550 --> 18:50.713
Sorry.

18:50.750 --> 18:53.719
Shawn,
what are you doing here?

18:53.760 --> 18:54.624
Trust me.

18:54.660 --> 18:56.924
The way today's going,
I need to relax too.

18:56.970 --> 18:58.767
I can't get the Chief
to reopen the case.

18:58.800 --> 19:02.031
I already--

19:02.080 --> 19:04.378
I already told you
I'm not helping you either.

19:04.420 --> 19:05.819
You will
when you hear this.

19:05.850 --> 19:06.817
What?

19:06.850 --> 19:07.782
I visited Wally.

19:07.820 --> 19:09.356
In prison.

19:09.390 --> 19:10.721
You went to the pen?

19:10.760 --> 19:12.523
I went to the joint.
You went to the clink?

19:12.560 --> 19:13.788
According to the visitors' log,
the only other person

19:13.830 --> 19:15.468
who dropped by
to see Wally

19:15.500 --> 19:17.502
was Jonny G.

19:17.540 --> 19:19.735
Who turns out to be
the Jonny G.

19:19.780 --> 19:22.772
of Jonny G.'s
Bling it On Custom Auto Shop.

19:22.820 --> 19:24.879
So all he's guilty of
is a bad pun?

19:24.920 --> 19:26.683
[scoffs]
Hardly.

19:26.730 --> 19:28.823
First Wally gets arrested
for running a chop shop,

19:28.860 --> 19:31.397
then he gets visited
by Jonny G.,

19:31.440 --> 19:33.032
_ who works
in custom auto parts.

19:33.070 --> 19:36.540
Adds a whole new angle
to the case, Gus.

19:36.580 --> 19:38.741
Look, is Jonny G.
dirty too?

19:38.780 --> 19:39.940
What's the G stand for?

19:39.990 --> 19:41.981
Is Wally working for him?

19:42.020 --> 19:43.851
What other criminal nonsense
are they up to?

19:43.890 --> 19:46.791
Man, we may have just uncovered
the tip of the iceberg here.

19:46.830 --> 19:47.967
That's all you've got?

19:48.000 --> 19:50.059
That...and this.

19:54.210 --> 19:55.916
It burns.

19:55.950 --> 19:57.838
Sitting here listening
to you right now,

19:57.890 --> 19:59.050
Little Shawn
just got bigger.

19:59.090 --> 20:00.159
I beg your pardon.

20:00.190 --> 20:01.953
No thanks.
Fine.

20:04.970 --> 20:06.904
What time are you seeing
that blind chick?

20:06.940 --> 20:08.100
Gloria can't see me.

20:08.140 --> 20:10.677
Dude, I know
how being blind works.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.575
I mean she's booked, Shawn.

20:12.620 --> 20:14.110
I had to book
with this girl named Kelly.

20:14.150 --> 20:16.618
I hope she's good.

20:16.660 --> 20:17.649
Mr. Guster.

20:19.200 --> 20:21.737
Are you ready
for your massage?

20:21.770 --> 20:22.998
[neck cracks]

20:23.040 --> 20:24.974
Kelly?

20:25.010 --> 20:26.875
Call me Kel.
[neck cracking]

20:26.910 --> 20:28.969
Um...you know what, Kel?

20:29.020 --> 20:31.557
I forgot I have another
appointment I have to go to.

20:31.590 --> 20:33.080
Uh...thanks for your time.

20:35.960 --> 20:37.734
Yo.

20:37.770 --> 20:38.862
Dude.

20:38.900 --> 20:40.936
That dude's shoulders looked
like two little baby heads.

20:40.970 --> 20:42.198
I know.

20:42.240 --> 20:43.548
Okay, I'll help.

20:43.580 --> 20:45.013
But_I must be back
in two hours.

20:45.050 --> 20:46.779
That's when I booked
the isolation chamber.

20:46.820 --> 20:49.152
Sweet.
We'll take your town car.

20:49.190 --> 20:51.078
You're not naked under there,
are you?

20:51.130 --> 20:52.950
Naked and unashamed.

20:53.000 --> 20:56.197
Man...
I'll be outside.

20:59.580 --> 21:00.672
How are we gonna get
this information

21:00.710 --> 21:01.517
out of Jonny G.?

21:01.550 --> 21:02.517
The dude thinks
we're customers, Gus.

21:02.520 --> 21:04.078
It's a perfect cover.

21:04.120 --> 21:04.916
I don't get it.

21:04.950 --> 21:06.622
Who wastes money
tricking out a car?

21:06.660 --> 21:07.888
It's frivolous
and ridiculous.

21:07.930 --> 21:11.093
Not to mention it compromises
the integrity of the vehicle.

21:18.920 --> 21:20.615
Yo, Shawn!

21:20.650 --> 21:22.083
Yo, lookin' good, man.

21:22.120 --> 21:23.155
Wassup, homie?

21:23.190 --> 21:24.726
Jonny G.,
how are ya?
Good, man.

21:24.760 --> 21:26.296
This is my friend,
Ovaltine Jenkins.

21:26.330 --> 21:27.729
Oh, respect,
a'ight?

21:27.770 --> 21:28.862
What's up, 0?
What's happening?

21:28.900 --> 21:30.162
Peace, man.
Yo, check it out.

21:30.200 --> 21:32.339
Your ride is fresh to death.

21:32.380 --> 21:34.610
Always do the last checks
myself, you know what I mean?

21:34.650 --> 21:35.844
Just to make sure
it meets specs.

21:35.880 --> 21:37.086
You know what I mean?
I do know what you mean.

21:37.120 --> 21:38.712
All right.
You know what I mean?

21:38.760 --> 21:42.059
[both laughing]

21:42.100 --> 21:43.761
What ride?

21:43.800 --> 21:45.791
This one.

21:45.840 --> 21:47.239
(Gus)
My car!

21:47.270 --> 21:48.908
Shawn!

21:48.940 --> 21:50.749
I told you it was
the perfect cover.

21:50.780 --> 21:53.214
That is fresh to death.

This is a company car, Shawn.

22:07.250 --> 22:08.103
I have _to visit clients
in this.

22:08.150 --> 22:09.117
Would you relax?

22:09.150 --> 22:09.946
I can't believe you spent

22:09.990 --> 22:11.855
all our money
from the chop shop case

22:11.890 --> 22:12.857
on this.

22:12.890 --> 22:13.857
[sighs]
What?

22:13.890 --> 22:15.357
You couldn't find
any magic beans?

22:15.400 --> 22:16.765
A "Jack and the Beanstalk"
reference?

22:16.800 --> 22:17.767
Really?

22:17.800 --> 22:19.062
You wasted our money.

22:19.100 --> 22:21.159
I reinvested it
in the business, Gus.

22:21.210 --> 22:23.371
Once we figure out what's up
with Jonny G.'s shop

22:23.410 --> 22:25.344
and re-solve the case,
we'll get another check.

22:25.380 --> 22:27.086
And you want to know what
we are going to do with it?

22:27.120 --> 22:28.052
Party like it's 1999.
No, we're gonna--

22:28.090 --> 22:29.057

No!

We're gonna
spend that money

22:31.530 --> 22:33.225
turning my car back
to the way it was.

22:33.270 --> 22:34.168
All right.

22:34.200 --> 22:35.235
But I still don't see

22:35.270 --> 22:37.033
why you won't drive it
like this.

22:37.070 --> 22:38.037
Because! _
It's embarrassmg.

22:38.070 --> 22:39.469

to fit a profile.

Cocoa Puffs.

24:57.050 --> 24:57.846
Exactly.

24:57.890 --> 24:59.448
I always thought
it was Cuckoo Puffs.

24:59.490 --> 25:02.152
No, Sonny is cuckoo
for the puffs,

25:02.200 --> 25:02.996
which are cocoa.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.468
That's why the milk turns
all brown and chocolatey.

I was never allowed to eat
that stuff when I was a kid.

25:24.170 --> 25:25.205
Yes, but there's more.

'Cause we told you,
the case is closed.

very specific information.

25:37.400 --> 25:38.628
O'Hara, run the numbers
by the crime lab,

miss anything in the sweep.

25:42.180 --> 25:44.478
And you better not be wasting
department time, Mr. Spencer.

25:44.510 --> 25:46.717

using these new vests on you.

25:46.750 --> 25:48.251
That's a great idea.
Thank you.

Because that way,

it's a plus for me

to run those numbers.

all of yesterday

25:59.540 --> 26:01.576
on this already-solved case.

26:01.620 --> 26:03.110
This is my last day
to enjoy my vacation.

26:03.120 --> 26:05.782
You don't realize
how much stress I've been--

26:05.820 --> 26:08.493
[turns up radio]

26:08.530 --> 26:10.498
I'm not playing, Shawn.

26:10.530 --> 26:11.599
I never get to do anything
for myself.

26:11.640 --> 26:12.868
I'm getting that massage.

26:12.900 --> 26:14.936
[turns radio off]
And yes, I'll be naked
and unashamed

26:14.970 --> 26:15.937
under my robe

26:15.980 --> 26:18.642
while they rub
Little Shawn down!

26:18.680 --> 26:22.457
[girls laughing]

26:22.490 --> 26:23.457
Wait!

26:23.490 --> 26:25.355
It wasn't like that!

26:25.400 --> 26:27.197
[under breath]
Damn.

26:27.230 --> 26:29.198
[radio playing hip-hop]

26:29.240 --> 26:30.537
[cell phone rings]

26:30.570 --> 26:33.846
Jules, what do you got
on those serial numbers?

26:33.880 --> 26:36.815
Well, the good news is,
they tracked them to car parts.

26:36.850 --> 26:39.648
The bad news is, the parts
were purchased legitimately

26:39.690 --> 26:40.759
for Bling it On.

26:40.790 --> 26:42.553
And the even worse news

26:42.600 --> 26:45.467
is that Lassiter wants to know
what Size vest you wear.

26:45.500 --> 26:46.990
Very funny.

26:47.040 --> 26:50.407
Thanks for making my life
more challenging.

26:50.440 --> 26:51.668
The car parts at the shop
were legit?

26:51.720 --> 26:53.688
Looks that way.

26:53.720 --> 26:54.641
There must be something else
going on down there

26:54.690 --> 26:55.440
that we're missing.

26:55.490 --> 26:57.685
Besides selling
stolen car parts.

26:57.730 --> 26:59.357
We gotta get back down there
and look for clues.

26:59.400 --> 27:00.924
[scoffing]
I don't know about you,

27:00.970 --> 27:02.767
but I'm still on vacation.

27:03.240 --> 27:06.334
[radio stops]

27:06.380 --> 27:08.371
Uh-oh.

27:08.410 --> 27:11.345
Looks like something's wrong
with your in-dash

27:11.390 --> 27:13.017
DVD navigation and integrated
surround sound system.

27:13.060 --> 27:14.857
That was my speedometer.

27:14.890 --> 27:16.551
Now I can't see
how fast I'm going.

27:16.600 --> 27:18.761
Regardless,
we've gotta take it back

27:18.800 --> 27:20.700
to Jonny G. to fix.

27:20.740 --> 27:23.743
[tools whirring]

27:25.680 --> 27:27.784
Hey, dude.
Is Jonny G. around?

27:27.820 --> 27:29.754
Uh, don't know.
We've been busy.

27:29.790 --> 27:31.792
What you working on there?

27:31.830 --> 27:33.969
Getting this fleet ready
to ship to Arizona.

27:36.740 --> 27:37.866
Okay, thanks.

27:38.940 --> 27:41.079
And stealth mode.

27:46.020 --> 27:47.885
What are we looking for,
anyway?

27:47.930 --> 27:49.454
Anything that points
to criminal activity.

27:49.500 --> 27:50.967
You know...

27:51.000 --> 27:52.729
a white cloth sack
with a green dollar sign.

27:52.770 --> 27:54.806
A red barrel
labeled "TNT."

27:54.840 --> 27:57.570
An anvil.
Anything.

27:57.610 --> 27:59.441
Check this out.

27:59.480 --> 28:00.811
What,
you already have something?

28:00.850 --> 28:01.748
The point of those examples
was to imply

28:01.790 --> 28:02.882
it wouldn't be so obvious.

28:02.920 --> 28:04.478
Look how light it is.

28:04.530 --> 28:05.997
Awesome.

28:06.030 --> 28:08.123
Flavor Flav can wear it
around his neck.

28:08.170 --> 28:10.866
Flav wears clocks,
not rims, Shawn.

28:10.910 --> 28:12.673
[phone ringing]

28:12.710 --> 28:14.075
Why don't you put your phone
on vibrate?

28:14.110 --> 28:17.079
Dad, this is not a good--

28:17.120 --> 28:18.883
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

28:18.920 --> 28:20.888
Okay, relax.

28:20.930 --> 28:22.818
I will be right there.

28:22.860 --> 28:24.066
[hangs up phone]

28:24.100 --> 28:25.761
We gott
a
Go? go'

28:25.800 --> 28:27.165
We either need
to be working on this case,

28:27.210 --> 28:28.905
or I need to be back
on my vacation.

28:28.940 --> 28:30.077
He said he needed me
there immediately.

28:30.110 --> 28:31.179
I've never heard him
sound this urgent.

28:31.210 --> 28:32.871
I hope everything's okay.

28:35.720 --> 28:37.449
(Henry)
Here. Scale.

28:37.490 --> 28:40.618
This was
the urgent emergency?

28:40.660 --> 28:42.139
Yeah--gotta get these
on the grill

28:42.170 --> 28:43.603
before it's too late.

28:43.640 --> 28:44.732
I can't believe
you had me rush down here

28:44.770 --> 28:45.771
for this, Dad.

28:45.810 --> 28:46.970
I thought something
was actually wrong with you.

28:47.010 --> 28:47.908
What's wrong with you?

28:47.950 --> 28:49.508
You remember how to scale,
don't you, Shawn?

28:49.550 --> 28:51.245
Yes, I remember
how to scale.

28:51.290 --> 28:53.258
You only made me do it
1,000 times as a kid.

28:53.290 --> 28:55.952
A kid who didn't believe
in animal cruelty, by the way.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.865
Those animals
would've killed you dead,

28:57.900 --> 28:58.867
given the means.

28:58.900 --> 29:00.663
All right,
you scrape the scales,

29:00.700 --> 29:01.803
you don't bruise
the flesh,

29:01.840 --> 29:03.273
you make an incision
around the gill,

29:03.310 --> 29:05.005
and you fillet--
Down the spine.

29:05.050 --> 29:06.915
Huh.

29:06.950 --> 29:07.882
Very good.

29:07.920 --> 29:08.887
You do remember.

29:08.920 --> 29:11.753
And Gus, you remember...

29:11.800 --> 29:13.028
where the bathroom is.

29:14.230 --> 29:16.937
You're taking me away from
very important work right now.

29:16.970 --> 29:18.801
I'll have you know
I'm on the verge

29:18.840 --> 29:21.047
of uncovering something big,
really big.

29:21.080 --> 29:21.944
Huge.

29:25.350 --> 29:28.319
Did you ever have a case
you couldn't crack?

29:28.360 --> 29:29.918
Yeah.

29:29.960 --> 29:30.927
Yeah, sure.
Of course.

29:30.970 --> 29:32.267
More than a few.

29:32.300 --> 29:35.030
But a good detective learns
the most when he doesn't

29:35.070 --> 29:36.037
get the bad guy.

29:36.080 --> 29:37.604
No, I got the bad guy.

29:37.650 --> 29:39.072
Oh, well,
sometimes he gets off.

29:39.120 --> 29:40.917
But a good detective doesn't
let that get him down.

29:40.950 --> 29:42.019
No, he's still in jail.

29:42.060 --> 29:43.789
Matter of fact,

29:43.830 --> 29:46.025
Chief Vick even says
it's my best work.

29:46.060 --> 29:47.266
All right,
then what's the problem?

29:47.300 --> 29:50.189
It doesn't feel
like my best work, you know?

29:50.240 --> 29:52.879
It feels too easy.

29:52.910 --> 29:54.878
Did you ever
have that problem?

29:56.780 --> 29:58.088
[gagging]

29:58.120 --> 29:59.257
No, Shawn, I don't recall

29:59.290 --> 30:01.019
any champagne problems

30:01.060 --> 30:03.392
like things being...

30:03.430 --> 30:05.660
too easy.

30:05.700 --> 30:07.304
I don't know,
I guess--

30:07.340 --> 30:08.978
I just imagined
my best work

30:09.010 --> 30:10.409
would be more complicated,
you know?

30:10.440 --> 30:13.011
More. . .intricate,

30:13.050 --> 30:15.245
important...
and just more,

30:15.290 --> 30:16.257
you know, more.

30:16.290 --> 30:17.951
As always,

30:17.990 --> 30:19.355
you go after something

30:19.400 --> 30:21.061
for the flash,
for the excitement.

30:21.100 --> 30:23.034
And when you finally get it,
you're never satisfied.

30:23.070 --> 30:24.037
It always needs
something more.

30:24.070 --> 30:25.901
That is categorically untrue.

30:25.940 --> 30:27.373
Your best case,
what does it need?

30:27.410 --> 30:28.172
It needs more excitement.

30:28.210 --> 30:29.677
Your first bike,
what did it need?

30:29.720 --> 30:31.347
More reflectors--
well, Shawn,

30:31.390 --> 30:32.812
did you ever stop and think
that maybe

30:32.860 --> 30:34.680
it's your expectations
that need to change?

30:34.730 --> 30:36.129
Son, look at me.
Look, Shawn.

30:36.160 --> 30:37.764
Sometimes,

30:37.800 --> 30:42.339
a case is just a case.

30:42.380 --> 30:44.041
[barking furiously]

30:44.080 --> 30:45.911
He's just a trainee
for K9 unit.

30:45.950 --> 30:46.769
Wait a second.

30:46.820 --> 30:49.118
Wait a second.
I just figured it out.

30:49.160 --> 30:50.889
Wait, wait, don't--
Shawn, don't do this.

30:50.930 --> 30:52.079
Oh, this is much bigger
than we thought.

30:52.130 --> 30:53.097
And I was right all along.

30:53.130 --> 30:55.064
Shawn, don't you dare--

30:55.100 --> 30:57.136
don't you dare learn
a wrong lesson while I'm trying

30:57.170 --> 30:58.831
to teach you a right lesson!

30:58.880 --> 31:01.098
Look how light it is.

31:01.150 --> 31:02.845
Getting this fleet ready
to ship to Arizona.

31:02.880 --> 31:05.110
Stop it--stop--stop--
stop trying to figure it out.

31:05.150 --> 31:06.253
Stop jumping!
I can't help it!

31:06.290 --> 31:07.279
It all makes sense!

31:07.330 --> 31:08.752
Gus, we gotta go!

31:08.800 --> 31:10.028
I'll explain on the way.

31:10.060 --> 31:11.027
Shawn, Shawn, Shawn.

31:11.070 --> 31:11.923
You should be happy
with a job

31:11.970 --> 31:14.234
well done,
regardless of the excitement

31:14.270 --> 31:15.237
that it produces.

31:15.270 --> 31:17.249
Is that it?

31:17.280 --> 31:18.975
Yeah, that's it.

31:20.250 --> 31:22.957
Is it a tight knot
right under the shoulder blade?

31:22.990 --> 31:24.082
Yeah, how'd you know?

31:24.130 --> 31:26.189
[Shawn screaming]
Gus!

31:27.370 --> 31:29.292
Jonny G. is smuggling drugs

31:29.340 --> 31:31.069
_ _out of state
in5ide of car parts.

31:31.110 --> 31:32.270
That's why those rims
at the office

31:32.310 --> 31:33.277
were so light, dude.

31:33.310 --> 31:34.072
They were hollow!

31:34.110 --> 31:35.179
And that's how
he gets the drugs out.

31:35.210 --> 31:37.314
And some of that residue
must've gotten on your car,

31:37.350 --> 31:38.851
which is why that police dog
went crazy

31:38.890 --> 31:40.209
barking at the wheels.

31:40.260 --> 31:42.125
That's what Wally's been
covering for all along.

31:42.160 --> 31:43.024
He's just a fall guy.

31:43.060 --> 31:45.028
Jonny G.'s running
the real operation.

31:45.070 --> 31:46.367
Drug trafficking.

31:46.400 --> 31:48.231
We need to make it back
to that shop

31:48.270 --> 31:49.931
before the evidence leaves
for Arizona.

31:51.280 --> 31:53.419
Let's go!

31:56.320 --> 31:57.321
Damn it,
we're too late.

31:57.360 --> 31:58.520
Somebody's here.

31:58.560 --> 31:59.891
(Shawn)
Ooh!

31:59.930 --> 32:02.296
Jonny G.!

32:02.340 --> 32:03.830
Yo, Johnny--

32:08.650 --> 32:10.379
Yo-hoo.

32:10.420 --> 32:12.411
[lift bangs down]

32:14.360 --> 32:16.021
[both scream]

32:21.140 --> 32:22.334
Dude!

32:22.380 --> 32:24.439
His foot is still
on the accelerator.

32:27.320 --> 32:29.481
[giggIeSI

32:29.520 --> 32:31.385
[both laughing]

32:31.430 --> 32:33.250
Stop!
This isn't funny.

32:33.300 --> 32:34.665
[laughter]

32:34.700 --> 32:37.339
You stop.

32:37.370 --> 32:39.406
I can't!

32:45.590 --> 32:47.717
The nitrous oxide
canister's open.

32:47.760 --> 32:49.091
Laughing gas?

32:49.130 --> 32:51.519
That stuff is deadly
in high doses.

32:51.570 --> 32:53.538
(Shawn)
At least we know
what the cause of death is.

32:53.570 --> 32:56.573
[both cracking up]

32:59.720 --> 33:01.745
I can't believe Jonny G.
went out like that.

33:01.790 --> 33:03.052
The police suspect
foul play.

33:03.090 --> 33:03.954
But so far,
they have no leads.

33:03.960 --> 33:07.225
All while I was on lockdown?

33:07.260 --> 33:08.522
Guess I ended up
with a better sentence

33:08.570 --> 33:10.094
than Jonny G. did.

33:10.140 --> 33:12.005
Irony.

33:12.040 --> 33:14.702
We still have
a few questions.

33:14.750 --> 33:16.775
What do you know
about a shipment

33:16.820 --> 33:18.447
of custom cars
on its way to...

33:18.490 --> 33:20.219
Arizona?

33:20.260 --> 33:21.488
(Wally)
We were partners, but...

33:21.530 --> 33:24.567
Jonny G. was involved in a lot
of stuff I didn't know about.

33:24.600 --> 33:25.692
IfI asked questions,
he'd be like, "Nunya."

33:25.730 --> 33:27.664
I'd be like, "Okay."
Relegate.

33:27.700 --> 33:30.077
So--so--you're saying
you weren't involved

33:30.110 --> 33:31.646
with the custom car shop
at all?

33:31.680 --> 33:33.773
I'm saying I was just
a front man for the chop shop.

33:33.820 --> 33:36.050
And now I'm doing
my time.

33:36.090 --> 33:38.354
But when I get out,
crime's gonna be like,

33:38.390 --> 33:40.529
"Come out and play, Wally.
Come on."

33:40.560 --> 33:41.788
I'ma be like,

33:41.830 --> 33:42.797
"NO."

33:42.830 --> 33:45.708
Wally doesn't live here
anymore.

33:45.740 --> 33:46.809
Reassimilated.

33:46.840 --> 33:48.546
[guard bangs on wall]

33:48.580 --> 33:50.116
Time's up.

34:08.450 --> 34:10.111
Dude.

34:10.160 --> 34:12.628
I'm starting to think
I was wrong about Wally.

34:12.660 --> 34:13.820
VVhen?

34:13.860 --> 34:15.828
The first time
or the second time?

34:15.870 --> 34:16.962
Both.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.878
I think he's the mastermind
behind this whole drug thing

34:19.910 --> 34:21.741
and Jonny G.'s murder.

34:21.780 --> 34:24.783
But Wally was in jail
when Jonny G. died.

34:24.820 --> 34:26.185
Yeah.

34:26.220 --> 34:27.812

to be delivered,

very, very thorough.
