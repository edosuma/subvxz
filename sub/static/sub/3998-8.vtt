00:07.869 --> 00:11.939
Ah, Hop Foo's, my favorite.
Don't mind if I brunch.

00:17.049 --> 00:20.460
- Are you eating takeout for breakfast?
- Hey, you're my girlfriend now.

00:20.461 --> 00:22.495
You're not supposed
to judge anything I do.

00:22.529 --> 00:24.964
- Say that again.
- You're my girlfriend now.

00:24.965 --> 00:26.165
(both laugh)

00:26.166 --> 00:29.361
I like it. Even when you have
dumpling in your mouth.

00:29.362 --> 00:31.037
Sounds good.

00:31.071 --> 00:33.817
I have to go. I have a big meeting
with Principal Foster today.

00:33.843 --> 00:36.033
I hate that guy. He always
says no to your ideas.

00:36.059 --> 00:38.177
No, no, no. Not this one.
This one is, uh,

00:38.212 --> 00:40.580
Ocean Conservation Day.

00:40.581 --> 00:42.065
Why do you do this
to yourself, Jess?

00:42.066 --> 00:43.433
So you're telling me
to not even try?

00:43.434 --> 00:45.980
I just don't want you to be
disappointed when he says no.

00:45.986 --> 00:49.067
Look, maybe you should try
to try a little less.

00:49.068 --> 00:52.325
- How am I supposed to try to not try?
- That's a catch-22.

00:53.427 --> 00:55.962
- Oh, hey, Coach.
- Oh, I dropped a dumpling!

00:55.996 --> 00:59.198
- That his breakfast?
- Yeah. Isn't it cute?

00:59.233 --> 01:01.100
- He's not even ashamed of it.
- Oh...

01:01.169 --> 01:04.236
I got it! It almost
got away from me... Aah!

01:04.271 --> 01:06.539
? Who's that girl?

01:06.573 --> 01:08.875
? <i>Who's that girl?</i> ?
? It's Jess.

01:08.909 --> 01:12.445
Look, Principal Foster, we have
the chance to do something really great.

01:12.479 --> 01:15.581
Everything's been donated.
All we need are transportation costs.

01:15.616 --> 01:16.582
(stammers)

01:16.617 --> 01:20.586
Come on! That's only the most
expensive part of doing anything!

01:20.621 --> 01:22.321
You... I'm sorry.

01:22.356 --> 01:24.490
That was rude.

01:24.525 --> 01:27.226
I slept very badly last night.

01:27.261 --> 01:31.264
Had a <i>chai tea</i> very late.
Had friends in from Montreal.

01:31.298 --> 01:33.299
Some of these kids have lived
in L.A. their entire lives

01:33.333 --> 01:35.568
and they've never
even seen the ocean.

01:35.602 --> 01:39.005
Last week I asked them to draw what
they thought the ocean looked like.

01:39.039 --> 01:41.340
I got a lot of stuff like this.

01:41.375 --> 01:43.442
Is that a bagel
with wings?

01:43.477 --> 01:45.199
- Yes, sir, it is.
- Extraordinary.

01:45.200 --> 01:47.001
I'm afraid
I'm not taking no for an answer.

01:47.005 --> 01:50.165
You're gonna have to take no for an
answer because that's just the way it is.

01:50.180 --> 01:52.814
Hmm, a shark with legs.

01:52.815 --> 01:55.936
That's not even anatomically
close to correct.

01:56.744 --> 01:58.912
That's just a square, though.

01:58.947 --> 02:01.888
Have them start over.
That's just terrible.

02:04.986 --> 02:06.586
Nick?

02:06.621 --> 02:08.854
I want to talk to you
about your fitness level.

02:08.889 --> 02:10.958
- Of what? My body?
- When's the last time you worked out?

02:10.991 --> 02:13.003
You know what? I'll tell you when
the last time he worked out was.

02:13.004 --> 02:15.595
It was the time that he battled
his daddy's other dumb sperm

02:15.630 --> 02:19.099
in order to make his way
to his mama's dumb-ass egg.

02:19.133 --> 02:20.300
Your burns
are getting better, man.

02:20.335 --> 02:22.069
- Just really long.
- Okay.

02:22.103 --> 02:23.804
Look, I don't
need to work out.

02:23.838 --> 02:26.039
I'm old-fashioned,
Coney Island fat-strong.

02:26.074 --> 02:29.876
Ah, Nicholas. Chinese food for breakfast.
See you're still a health nut.

02:29.911 --> 02:32.969
- Aren't you supposed to be at work?
- I'm rocking a PD... personal day.

02:32.970 --> 02:34.881
Yeah, last day of the move.

02:34.916 --> 02:37.818
Coach, I see you've wasted no
time moving into my old room.

02:37.852 --> 02:39.886
Anyway, I just
came over to, uh,

02:39.921 --> 02:42.080
drop off my old key.

02:42.799 --> 02:44.624
Wow, so this is like a moment.

02:44.659 --> 02:46.893
Looking to get some much-needed
space from this place.

02:46.928 --> 02:48.428
- You're right across the hall.
- That's true.

02:48.463 --> 02:51.398
Everywhere you go...

02:51.432 --> 02:52.833
There you are.

02:52.867 --> 02:54.901
- What?
- COACH: What?

02:54.936 --> 02:57.637
- His jeans are so small.
- NICK: He looks like a little puppet.

02:57.672 --> 02:59.639
Like something
some Italian whittled.

02:59.674 --> 03:01.965
- Come on, man, just let me train you.
- You know what, Nick? You should do it.

03:01.966 --> 03:03.408
I would love for
Coach to train me,

03:03.409 --> 03:05.909
but I kind of pushed it too
hard at the court yesterday.

03:05.936 --> 03:08.271
Went in for a dunk.
Landed sort of funny.

03:08.305 --> 03:10.039
(yells)

03:10.074 --> 03:12.575
Typical Winston.
(laughing)

03:12.610 --> 03:14.744
- That's true.
- What is that supposed to mean?

03:14.934 --> 03:16.869
Because you're always
too injured to play.

03:16.870 --> 03:18.904
Remember when you sat out of
the game because you were sad?

03:18.939 --> 03:20.373
I was also cold.

03:21.383 --> 03:24.082
Nick. Let's do this.

03:24.584 --> 03:25.918
Look at me.

03:25.919 --> 03:27.553
Now, you're
in a new relationship,

03:27.554 --> 03:29.448
which puts you at risk
for gaining the boyfriend 15.

03:29.449 --> 03:31.131
- That's not a thing.
- It is a thing.

03:31.151 --> 03:33.354
Jess is into this.

03:33.355 --> 03:35.809
I've seen this happen
a million times.

03:35.810 --> 03:38.475
The boyfriend 15 quickly turns
into the boyfriend 20.

03:38.492 --> 03:41.360
Next thing you know, you're
a fat dude on a little bike

03:41.395 --> 03:44.263
with a cowboy hat on talking
about, "My ass hurts."

03:44.264 --> 03:46.633
- I don't want to be that.
- I don't want you to be that.

03:46.634 --> 03:48.990
I would just be riding around in circles
or would I be going places?

03:48.991 --> 03:51.273
Circles, dude.
Fat-guy rash on your arm.

03:51.274 --> 03:54.694
Okay, look, Schmidt's tried to get me
to work out for years. It didn't take.

03:54.695 --> 03:57.497
Also, and it's not an excuse,
I have a very bad back.

03:57.532 --> 03:58.732
- Your bad back?
- Yeah.

03:58.733 --> 04:01.580
You gave me a piggyback ride two days
ago and you giggled the whole time.

04:01.581 --> 04:03.049
It was awesome.

04:03.083 --> 04:04.617
- It was also really funny.
- That was pretty funny.

04:04.651 --> 04:06.152
- We took the stairs, dude.
- Yeah.

04:06.186 --> 04:07.641
- It's 'cause I was excited.
- Nick.

04:07.642 --> 04:10.300
Either take this dumpling
and be a dumpling guy,

04:10.331 --> 04:13.008
or you train with me,
and be a do-ing guy.

04:13.009 --> 04:14.757
It's hard because I've been a
dumpling guy my whole life...

04:14.782 --> 04:16.995
I know. One day,
that's all I need.

04:16.997 --> 04:18.870
And I will change your life.

04:18.872 --> 04:20.539
You'll be able to see your abs.

04:22.536 --> 04:24.737
I thought God
just didn't give me those.

04:24.771 --> 04:26.439
Come on.

04:26.473 --> 04:27.907
Let's do it.

04:27.941 --> 04:29.075
- My man!
- I'm in!

04:29.109 --> 04:31.577
I'm gonna warn you.
Working out is not my thing.

04:31.611 --> 04:33.366
Not worried, man.
I do not fail.

04:33.390 --> 04:35.114
You know what?
I'm in, too.

04:35.148 --> 04:36.482
You're injured, you shouldn't,
you shouldn't do it.

04:36.516 --> 04:40.186
What? Come on, Winnie the Bish play
through the pain, baby. You know what?

04:40.220 --> 04:41.587
Let's warm up
with some jumping jacks.

04:41.621 --> 04:43.989
(yells)

04:44.024 --> 04:46.292
(smacks lips)

04:46.326 --> 04:48.361
(groans)

04:48.395 --> 04:49.960
I was going... Oh!

04:52.526 --> 04:53.993
Miss Day!

04:54.027 --> 04:55.995
Check out my cool beach hat.

04:56.029 --> 04:58.164
Unfortunately, um,
I have some bad news.

04:58.198 --> 05:01.701
Uh, we're not gonna get
to go on that field trip.

05:01.735 --> 05:05.938
But you said anything
is possible, Miss Day.

05:07.407 --> 05:10.243
You just keep wearing
that hat, Crystal.

05:10.277 --> 05:13.532
Because as long as
hot dogs are hats...

05:14.792 --> 05:16.916
Anything is possible.

05:16.950 --> 05:19.821
You could be the first
little girl in space.

05:19.822 --> 05:23.813
You just ride that hot dog hat
all the way to the moon, girl.

05:24.700 --> 05:28.361
Oh, Crystal, you're not
legally allowed to touch me.

05:28.395 --> 05:30.129
But thank you.

05:32.966 --> 05:35.401
(groans)

05:36.241 --> 05:38.938
Hey, guess who got a trainer.

05:38.939 --> 05:41.301
- So many menus.
- I'm gonna look like Barry Bonds.

05:41.302 --> 05:43.436
- Seriously, what the hell?
- Hey.

05:43.740 --> 05:45.141
(groans)

05:45.143 --> 05:46.710
I take it, it didn't
go well with Foster.

05:46.745 --> 05:48.112
- It did not go well.
- Aw, Jess.

05:48.146 --> 05:51.849
- I hate seeing you hurt like this.
- Are you serious? More menus?

05:51.883 --> 05:54.619
This is like... Why do
we need more menus?

05:54.620 --> 05:57.421
- Don't we have enough menus?
- Feels like you're saying menus a lot.

05:57.455 --> 05:59.056
This is an eco-disaster.

05:59.090 --> 06:01.759
Conservation deserves
a win today.

06:01.793 --> 06:03.861
Hop Foo's has killed
its last tree.

06:03.892 --> 06:06.530
Jess, this feels like a
something-else-is-going-on type of thing.

06:06.565 --> 06:08.732
Are you okay to drive?
You got crazy eye!

06:12.470 --> 06:14.638
Uh, welcome to Hop Foo's.
Can I help you?

06:14.673 --> 06:18.475
This morning, there were nine
menus just in my apartment.

06:18.510 --> 06:21.478
I also hate those menus, they're
so bad for the environment.

06:21.513 --> 06:25.082
It's wasteful.
It's an eco-disaster.

06:25.116 --> 06:26.951
I'll talk to my boss,
see if we can change that.

06:26.985 --> 06:28.719
Yeah, great, you do that.

06:28.753 --> 06:30.788
I'm gonna follow up
with you on that.

06:30.789 --> 06:33.136
I compost, recycle, but it's...
I don't feel like it's enough.

06:33.137 --> 06:35.271
Thank you.
Geez, thank you so much

06:35.272 --> 06:37.797
for stepping up
and saying something.

06:37.798 --> 06:39.807
That's who I am,
that's just, you know, I'm...

06:39.842 --> 06:42.407
- My name's Brian.
- Jess. Jessica. Jess.

06:42.446 --> 06:45.750
It's really refreshing to meet
someone who actually cares.

06:45.751 --> 06:47.682
Well, it helps
that you're gorgeous.

06:47.683 --> 06:49.717
Ha! Blah!

06:49.752 --> 06:51.556
(laughs) Burr!

06:51.601 --> 06:55.003
No, that's crazy.
That ain't real.

06:55.038 --> 06:57.973
That's dumb. That's straight dumb.
You're dumb.

06:58.007 --> 06:59.341
You're nice.

06:59.376 --> 07:02.036
You excited for the holidays?
I am. Hmm.

07:02.037 --> 07:03.771
Anyway...

07:03.878 --> 07:06.480
- My system is built to be easy.
- Okay.

07:06.514 --> 07:07.581
It's easy as peanuts.

07:07.615 --> 07:09.149
- Easy as peanuts?
- Yeah.

07:09.183 --> 07:10.650
That's not an expression;
no one says that.

07:10.685 --> 07:11.885
PEANUTS is an acronym.
PEANUTS stands for:

07:11.919 --> 07:15.522
Physical Education
Activity Nuts!

07:16.624 --> 07:18.158
Like, like go nuts, have fun!

07:18.192 --> 07:19.426
Yeah, but you got
to use every letter.

07:19.460 --> 07:20.894
I'm aware of that,
but it still works.

07:20.928 --> 07:22.229
- Yo. Yo.
- Hey.

07:22.263 --> 07:25.165
What's going on, guys?
(chuckles) Let's do this.

07:25.199 --> 07:26.800
I tell you, ain't
no injury gonna hold

07:26.834 --> 07:30.137
Old Winnie the Bish down, 'cause
I'm a warrior. Nick knows.

07:30.171 --> 07:32.305
Burpies?
All right, cool.

07:32.340 --> 07:33.306
(groans)

07:33.341 --> 07:36.076
- Injury is gonna get worse.
- I'm not a quitter! (phone rings)

07:36.110 --> 07:39.112
Hey, Schmidt, what's going on, man?
Everything okay?

07:39.147 --> 07:41.181
Did I leave my Oakland Raiders
yarmulke over there?

07:41.215 --> 07:43.797
<i>Don't know.
Coach and I are working out.</i>

07:45.019 --> 07:47.287
I've been trying to get you
to work out for years.

07:47.321 --> 07:50.590
- Well, just come over, man.
- I'm enjoying my space.

07:50.625 --> 07:53.093
But maybe you should
just put me on speaker.

07:53.127 --> 07:55.162
- Okay, you're on.
<i>- Okay, cool, set the scene.</i>

07:55.196 --> 07:57.597
<i>- What's the vibe over there?</i>
- Nick's in jeans.

07:57.632 --> 08:00.834
Nixon jeans? What the hell
are Nixon jeans?

08:00.868 --> 08:02.202
They sound really cool.

08:02.236 --> 08:05.939
(sighs)
Hey, I solved the menu thing.

08:05.973 --> 08:07.607
I just went down there,
I took action.

08:07.642 --> 08:08.842
Boom-yah.

08:08.876 --> 08:09.976
I made a change.

08:10.011 --> 08:11.478
Now that I can do
that, I really feel

08:11.512 --> 08:13.013
like I can figure out
this field trip thing.

08:13.047 --> 08:14.242
Double boom-yah.

08:14.243 --> 08:15.543
(both chuckle)

08:18.486 --> 08:20.654
There are still some things
we need to figure out.

08:20.688 --> 08:23.323
Just got to get
the message across.

08:23.357 --> 08:27.327
Hey, hey, you don't, you don't
need to leave these anymore.

08:27.361 --> 08:29.996
Hey, hey, hey!

08:30.031 --> 08:31.298
Where are you running to?

08:31.332 --> 08:33.200
Who sent you?

08:33.234 --> 08:37.471
Brian, I thought you were
gonna talk to your boss.

08:37.505 --> 08:40.346
- I am the boss.
- Hop Foo's is your restaurant?

08:40.374 --> 08:42.008
Sorry I lied.

08:42.009 --> 08:44.419
You just seemed kind of crazy,
so I didn't want to deal.

08:44.420 --> 08:46.063
But you care about
conservation.

08:46.075 --> 08:47.809
Oh, I don't,
I really don't.

08:48.015 --> 08:49.516
I care
about my restaurant.

08:49.550 --> 08:51.818
You're going down, Brian!

08:51.853 --> 08:54.988
I'm gonna collect signatures,
I'm gonna start a petition,

08:55.022 --> 08:59.526
and I will turn it in
to the person who's in charge

08:59.560 --> 09:01.027
of restaurants.

09:01.062 --> 09:03.063
And I'm gonna report
you to the City!

09:03.097 --> 09:05.332
Oh, no, not the City.

09:05.366 --> 09:06.500
No!

09:06.534 --> 09:07.901
You're a jerk, Brian!

09:07.935 --> 09:09.169
I'm gonna burn down
your building!

09:09.203 --> 09:11.071
I won't do that,
I won't do that.

09:11.105 --> 09:13.073
Why do people suck?!

09:13.107 --> 09:15.041
Ow!

09:16.750 --> 09:18.960
COACH: Okay, we're gonna
warm up with music.

09:18.994 --> 09:20.428
(electronic music playing)

09:21.715 --> 09:24.599
- Yeah, feeling that?
- I guess so.

09:25.667 --> 09:27.535
Yeah, got to loosen up
the shoulders.

09:30.439 --> 09:31.639
Wiggle those arms.

09:31.640 --> 09:32.773
(gibbering)

09:32.808 --> 09:34.791
- Arms, not your face.
- Oh, sorry, thought you said "face."

09:34.817 --> 09:36.017
Right.

09:36.719 --> 09:38.993
- Sexy. Working out is sexy.
- Yeah, it is.

09:39.047 --> 09:42.183
That's not sexy, man.
This is sexy.

09:42.217 --> 09:43.417
That isn't sexy.

09:43.452 --> 09:46.543
Ooh, ay.

09:52.882 --> 09:54.850
Damn it!

09:54.884 --> 09:56.885
It's a great workout track!

10:00.156 --> 10:02.224
What's next?

10:03.626 --> 10:05.594
And time.

10:05.628 --> 10:06.561
- Yes!
- Yes!

10:06.596 --> 10:08.279
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

10:08.302 --> 10:10.165
Let's do it again.

10:10.166 --> 10:11.767
- Again?
- Yeah, man.

10:13.705 --> 10:16.535
(grunting):
Six, seven, eight.

10:16.536 --> 10:18.970
Come on, man!

10:19.242 --> 10:21.209
Mine's broken.

10:21.244 --> 10:22.744
Push through it, man, you got it.

10:22.856 --> 10:25.244
- Ah, thank God you're here, Cece.
- What's the emergency?

10:25.245 --> 10:26.856
Why does Jess need
all this Chinese food?

10:26.857 --> 10:28.650
No, no, no, I just
made all that up.

10:28.685 --> 10:30.852
Wait, you tricked me
into getting you food?

10:30.853 --> 10:32.187
Yes.

10:32.188 --> 10:33.522
Why?

10:33.523 --> 10:35.358
- Nick, what is this?
- For after... don't worry about it.

10:35.359 --> 10:36.625
I will be right back.

10:36.626 --> 10:38.126
(sighs)

10:39.295 --> 10:41.320
Hello <i>zere</i>.

10:42.151 --> 10:45.935
- I'm, I'm Cece, I-I remember you.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, great memory.

10:45.936 --> 10:48.804
That's what's up, that's what's up.
No doubt.

10:48.838 --> 10:50.272
Diggity.

10:50.306 --> 10:51.773
(sighs) (chuckles)

10:56.512 --> 10:59.948
- Nick!
- Breasts... Ni...

10:59.983 --> 11:03.099
This is for the food, and
there's a little extra for you.

11:03.987 --> 11:06.456
- Oh, my God, are you tipping me?
- Yeah.

11:07.156 --> 11:10.258
Well, if I'm gonna get in trouble,
give it back. I gave you four bucks.

11:10.293 --> 11:12.828
I'll tip you good...
I'll tip you right over.

11:12.862 --> 11:15.332
- Good stuff.
- Yeah, yeah.

11:15.898 --> 11:17.966
Damn, I wish I could have
said something else.

11:18.001 --> 11:20.552
- "Tip you right over" was good.
- Oh, okay, cool. Uh, is she single?

11:20.553 --> 11:22.320
- Yeah, kind of.
- Oh, cool, man.

11:22.321 --> 11:23.822
- Yeah.
- What are you doing?

11:23.823 --> 11:25.340
Oh, I'm just gonna...
it's just

11:25.341 --> 11:26.942
a protein boost.
I'm just gonna eat a little.

11:26.976 --> 11:28.176
That's not how
it works, dude.

11:28.211 --> 11:29.277
We're still in the
middle of our workout.

11:29.312 --> 11:30.612
- We're not done yet?
- No!

11:30.646 --> 11:32.180
Hey, whoa.

11:32.215 --> 11:35.183
I just had a very productive conversation
with the owner of the restaurant.

11:35.218 --> 11:37.185
Action has been taken,
change is in the air.

11:37.220 --> 11:41.156
Now I'm going to go research
lawsuits in my room for fun.

11:41.613 --> 11:44.926
- You okay? You seem a little off.
- Stop ordering from that place.

11:44.961 --> 11:46.234
Nick, put the dumpling down.

11:47.533 --> 11:50.132
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up, Jason Street?

11:50.166 --> 11:52.534
The Internet said
that I had to stay off my feet,

11:52.568 --> 11:54.536
but then I found this wheelchair
in a ditch,

11:54.570 --> 11:56.705
so I'm ready to work out.

11:56.739 --> 12:00.308
Winston, go lay down.
Nick, put the dumpling down.

12:00.343 --> 12:02.411
- Relax.
- Whoops. (gasps)

12:02.445 --> 12:05.047
Did you just gasp?
(laughs)

12:05.081 --> 12:07.182
- I'm having one...
- Down.

12:07.216 --> 12:10.685
I'm gonna ask you again.
Don't...

12:11.854 --> 12:13.188
Don't do it.

12:14.957 --> 12:16.925
Don't. D...

12:16.959 --> 12:20.362
I'm going to eat
one bite of this.

12:20.396 --> 12:22.531
Don't do it.
You're better than this.

12:22.565 --> 12:24.733
I don't know if I am.
I might.. No.

12:24.767 --> 12:27.002
- Don't, don't.
- Stop shaking it like that.

12:27.036 --> 12:28.437
- Let me eat the dumpling!
- What's going on?

12:28.471 --> 12:31.006
- BOTH: Oh, just working out.
- Yeah. Just chilling. (grunts)

12:31.040 --> 12:34.676
- Does this food have MSG in it?
- JESS: What?

12:34.710 --> 12:36.411
(clenched): Oh, my God,
MSG makes my jaw lock up.

12:36.446 --> 12:37.412
You all right, dude?

12:37.447 --> 12:38.647
- What?
- Mm-hmm.

12:38.681 --> 12:40.727
- What's going on with your jaw?
- Yeah, dude.

12:40.750 --> 12:42.384
(groans)
Come on, you son of a...

12:42.418 --> 12:44.920
Wait a minute.
Ha, "no MSG."

12:46.155 --> 12:48.223
Where are you going?

12:48.257 --> 12:49.958
- I'm just taking Winston for a walk.
- Where are you taking me?

12:49.992 --> 12:52.227
- I think he needs some fresh air.
- BOTH: Aah!

12:52.261 --> 12:54.020
Damn it, Coach.

12:54.021 --> 12:56.853
Nick! I want you to really
think about your next step.

12:56.887 --> 13:01.123
- Why do you care so much?
- This is a crucial moment, a crossroads.

13:01.158 --> 13:02.959
By you eating that,
you are telling me

13:02.993 --> 13:04.861
that you'd rather sit on
the couch eating dumplings

13:04.895 --> 13:07.029
than do something
with your life.

13:07.099 --> 13:09.532
Now, are you a doer
or a dumpling-er?

13:09.566 --> 13:12.702
I'm sorry,
I'm not you, man.

13:12.736 --> 13:15.037
I'm a dumpling-er.
Mmm.

13:15.873 --> 13:18.207
Oh, it's veggie.

13:18.242 --> 13:20.009
I did all that
for nothing?

13:21.511 --> 13:22.812
I tried.

13:22.846 --> 13:25.915
- Where are you taking me?
- What? You're my smoking gun.

13:25.949 --> 13:27.750
Winston's in a wheelchair?

13:27.784 --> 13:29.552
What's next, Roberto Benigni
coming through the halls,

13:29.586 --> 13:31.087
making everybody laugh?

13:31.121 --> 13:32.521
(bumps)
Aah! Ow!

13:32.556 --> 13:34.390
Missing everything.

13:34.424 --> 13:36.325
Take these.

13:36.360 --> 13:37.683
Oh.

13:37.684 --> 13:39.018
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:39.019 --> 13:40.620
- Hi.
- Don't even talk.

13:40.629 --> 13:42.753
My friend is having an allergic
reaction to your food.

13:42.787 --> 13:45.839
- Hey, man.
- It says "no MSG" on the menu.

13:45.840 --> 13:47.531
It also says it with the...

13:47.573 --> 13:49.574
what do you call the circle
with the diagonal line?

13:49.608 --> 13:51.409
- It's the <i>Ghostbusters</i> thing.
- What?

13:51.443 --> 13:52.810
From the movie <i>Ghostbusters.</i>

13:52.845 --> 13:56.581
Oh, it says it with words an
it says it with the <i>Ghostbusters</i> thing.

13:56.615 --> 13:58.683
- All right, just calm down.
- No, here's what's going to happen.

13:58.717 --> 14:00.718
You're going to stop putting
these menus everywhere,

14:00.753 --> 14:02.287
or I'm going to
show the people

14:02.321 --> 14:04.889
in here what happens
when you eat the food.

14:04.923 --> 14:08.498
- I actually like the food.
- Listen, Jess, Chinese food <i>is</i> MSG.

14:08.499 --> 14:10.133
America is living a lie,

14:10.134 --> 14:12.316
and we distribute menus
so people order the food.

14:12.317 --> 14:14.551
Just accept that that's
the way things are!

14:14.552 --> 14:18.369
No, I am done accepting things
the way they are,

14:18.370 --> 14:21.272
because there are menus
everywhere,

14:21.307 --> 14:23.941
and there are kids
who want to see the ocean.

14:23.976 --> 14:27.312
- What?
- And I don't like your vibe, dude.

14:27.346 --> 14:28.980
(groans) Hey!

14:29.014 --> 14:31.549
This is what eating here did
to my friend.

14:33.073 --> 14:35.441
Is that crispy noodles?

14:35.475 --> 14:38.110
(Coach singing) Coach.

14:38.144 --> 14:41.280
? Oh, no, no.

14:41.314 --> 14:44.249
- What the hell are you doing, man?
- I'm making island beats.

14:44.284 --> 14:45.918
I think this is
what I'm gonna do

14:45.952 --> 14:48.387
from now on, since,
obviously, I can't coach.

14:48.421 --> 14:50.564
I thought we were
just messing around.

14:50.565 --> 14:52.624
Why are you taking this so hard?

14:52.625 --> 14:56.628
Because, dude, I was trying to prove
to myself that I could still do this.

14:56.663 --> 15:00.432
Ever since Malia broke up
with me... I don't know...

15:00.467 --> 15:03.302
I've just been a mess. Feel like
I can't do anything right.

15:03.336 --> 15:07.706
(sighs) Guys, it's locked, it's unlocked.
Get it together for real.

15:07.740 --> 15:10.042
What are you doing here? I thought
you said you were so busy.

15:10.076 --> 15:11.710
I found this extra alarm clock,

15:11.744 --> 15:15.447
and, uh, I thought it'd be neighborly,
so I'll set it up for you guys.

15:15.482 --> 15:16.906
You're welcome.

15:17.951 --> 15:19.318
Wait a second.

15:19.352 --> 15:22.454
- What is that?
- What's what?

15:22.455 --> 15:24.034
- Is that a camera?
- Hmm?

15:24.035 --> 15:26.203
Schmidt, are you
spying on us?

15:26.626 --> 15:29.261
So... (scoffs)
It is... it's a camera.

15:29.295 --> 15:33.065
- Well, I'm shocked.
- Schmidt, look, you decided to move out.

15:33.099 --> 15:34.800
- So move out.
- I am out.

15:34.834 --> 15:36.969
I'm actually very busy,
you know that?

15:37.003 --> 15:40.305
I'm actually late for a very
important coffee with a...

15:40.340 --> 15:42.274
with a dear friend of mine.

15:42.308 --> 15:43.709
- Who's that?
- Hmm?

15:43.743 --> 15:45.511
- Who?
- Yeah.

15:45.545 --> 15:48.147
Wouldn't you like to know?

15:48.181 --> 15:50.682
(door closes)
? Tiny pants man

15:50.717 --> 15:52.751
? He don't have friends

15:52.785 --> 15:54.653
? That's why he got the clock

15:54.687 --> 15:58.257
? He got the clock to watch
his only friends. ?

15:59.446 --> 16:02.628
Are you enjoying your meal?
Winston enjoyed his meal, right?

16:02.662 --> 16:04.429
- Until he had an allergic reaction.
- MAN: Let's go.

16:04.464 --> 16:06.328
There. I drove away all
of your customers,

16:06.332 --> 16:10.576
and I'm gonna do that every day
until you stop with the menus.

16:10.791 --> 16:13.393
- Earth warrior!
- You win. I'll stop.

16:13.427 --> 16:15.595
Thank you.

16:15.629 --> 16:17.563
Charles?

16:17.598 --> 16:19.732
You're fired.

16:19.767 --> 16:22.268
- What? No!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

16:22.303 --> 16:24.537
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Don't fire him.

16:24.571 --> 16:26.906
- He's the menu guy.
- I was just trying to make a difference.

16:26.941 --> 16:28.975
You did. At the beginning
of the day, this guy had a job.

16:29.009 --> 16:31.110
Now he doesn't, so congrats
on your victory. You win.

16:31.145 --> 16:33.513
(loud guttural sob)

16:34.748 --> 16:36.149
(loud guttural sob)

16:36.183 --> 16:38.751
Do you have any teaching experience?
(sobs)

16:38.786 --> 16:41.461
Does anyone have
an antihistamine?

16:47.038 --> 16:49.406
You know, I just moved
across the hall,

16:49.441 --> 16:52.543
but it feels like I moved
across an entire ocean.

16:52.544 --> 16:55.345
People grow up,
especially young people.

16:55.559 --> 16:57.593
So my friends don't even
miss me anymore?

16:57.594 --> 16:59.788
Uh-huh. Well, they don't miss you.

16:59.789 --> 17:01.733
- They've moved on.
- What?

17:02.293 --> 17:04.227
Well, how do you know that?

17:04.262 --> 17:07.396
Because <i>he</i> told me.

17:07.432 --> 17:11.048
?His name is Conner, and he
went to SUNY Binghamton.

17:11.049 --> 17:13.502
I once lived
with 40 birds,

17:13.538 --> 17:16.670
and they all flew
away, and I moved on.

17:19.611 --> 17:21.545
Slow down on the
noodles, buddy.

17:21.579 --> 17:24.247
Well, congratulations,
Miller. You were right.

17:24.281 --> 17:26.516
- What happened?
- I terrorized a restaurant.

17:26.550 --> 17:29.086
I got a good man fired.

17:29.120 --> 17:32.556
I might have ran over a lizard with
my wheelchair, but I am ashamed of it.

17:32.590 --> 17:35.292
So, that's what
you get for trying.

17:35.326 --> 17:37.728
Let's see what the
enemy tastes like.

17:37.762 --> 17:39.863
It's good. Anybody want to
help me use the bathroom?

17:39.897 --> 17:42.466
- No. No.
- Okay, I'll work it out.

17:42.500 --> 17:44.901
I shouldn't have even tried.
You just get hurt.

17:44.936 --> 17:46.269
COACH:
This is such a relief.

17:46.304 --> 17:47.738
I can get fat now.

17:47.772 --> 17:50.540
- Hey, guys, stop it!
- I want to eat this all day.

17:50.575 --> 17:54.244
Like a Chinese food
ménage. Oh!

17:54.278 --> 17:56.446
Okay, you guys are doers,
and people like me,

17:56.481 --> 17:59.916
people who don't do anything...
we actually need people like you.

17:59.951 --> 18:02.419
- Mmm...
- Oh, boy, this is bad.

18:02.453 --> 18:04.988
Uh, this... Okay, all right.

18:05.023 --> 18:07.624
I'm gonna give you guys a speech,
and it's gonna fire you guys up.

18:07.659 --> 18:09.826
- Got some on my pants...
- First we're gonna start with compliments

18:09.861 --> 18:12.262
to build up your confidence.
Okay, uh,

18:12.296 --> 18:14.798
- Coach, you're a great guy.
- Mmm...

18:14.832 --> 18:16.466
You've got strong bodies.

18:16.501 --> 18:17.834
- Aah!
- What?

18:17.869 --> 18:20.470
You just need some more clients.
I believe in you.

18:20.505 --> 18:23.106
- Thanks.
- Jess, you're awesome.

18:23.141 --> 18:24.808
You are the most
resourceful,

18:24.842 --> 18:26.410
optimistic, amazing person

18:26.444 --> 18:28.078
I've ever met in my life.

18:28.112 --> 18:29.579
I can't even get my
kids on a field trip.

18:29.614 --> 18:31.848
You can do anything you
put your mind to 'cause

18:31.883 --> 18:34.284
you're smart, okay? Why can't
you get 'em on this field trip?

18:34.318 --> 18:35.652
There's no way to get
them to the beach.

18:35.687 --> 18:38.321
That's a board.
Karate-kick it!

18:38.356 --> 18:40.524
You're not used
to making speeches, are you?

18:40.558 --> 18:43.226
Point of it is,
is you never give up.

18:44.629 --> 18:45.929
(door slams shut)

18:45.963 --> 18:50.133
Fine. I guess you win.
I sort of miss being here.

18:50.168 --> 18:51.835
Well, the nanny cam
kind of gave it away.

18:51.869 --> 18:55.267
Well, nobody helped me,
so now there is a real mess.

18:55.268 --> 18:57.441
Hey, Winston, do you have some
money where we could rent,

18:57.475 --> 18:59.109
like, a car or a
bus or something?

18:59.143 --> 19:00.711
I found this wheelchair
in a ditch.

19:00.745 --> 19:03.046
Is anyone gonna tell me anything
that's going on?

19:03.081 --> 19:06.149
Stop! If it's not an idea about
how to rent a car or a van,

19:06.184 --> 19:07.784
then I don't
want to hear it!

19:07.819 --> 19:09.553
Wait a minute. Nick?

19:10.655 --> 19:12.355
That's brilliant!

19:12.390 --> 19:14.345
JESS: Boys and girls,
transportation provided

19:14.358 --> 19:16.226
by Hop Foo's restaurant.

19:16.260 --> 19:18.628
All right, everybody, we did it!

19:18.663 --> 19:22.966
Ocean Conservation Day
starts... now!

19:23.000 --> 19:25.702
Welcome to the Pacific Ocean!

19:25.737 --> 19:28.672
Yeah. The large body
of water to my left.

19:28.706 --> 19:32.209
No horseplay, guys.
Guys, don't talk to strangers.

19:32.243 --> 19:35.625
And you said it wouldn't fit.

19:35.651 --> 19:38.415
I knew it would fit. I just
didn't want you to bring it.

19:38.449 --> 19:40.684
Careful. It's got
a trick wheel.

19:40.718 --> 19:42.219
- I think it's fine.
- Okay.

19:42.253 --> 19:45.188
- Aah! Trick wheel.
- Not fine. Sorry.

19:45.223 --> 19:46.523
(Nick grunting)

19:46.557 --> 19:48.892
Nice wheelchair.

19:48.926 --> 19:50.060
Ms. Day?

19:50.094 --> 19:52.195
- Hey.
- Thank you.

19:52.230 --> 19:55.499
Here. You deserve this.

19:55.533 --> 19:58.168
Oh, thank you.
I love it.

19:58.202 --> 20:01.838
But you know what? I think this
actually belongs to Nick Miller,

20:01.873 --> 20:03.759
'cause he did this.

20:03.760 --> 20:04.994
Oh, wow!

20:05.376 --> 20:09.546
- Is this your dad?
- How old do you think I am, little girl?

20:09.580 --> 20:11.748
All right.

20:12.683 --> 20:15.185
- I don't want this gift.
- It's her favorite hat.

20:15.219 --> 20:16.553
(laughter)

20:16.587 --> 20:17.954
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:17.989 --> 20:19.626
You made a difference.
How's it feel?

20:20.658 --> 20:22.726
It feels good.
(laughs)

20:22.760 --> 20:25.195
Yeah, actually, it feels
great. I feel like, um...

20:25.229 --> 20:28.265
I don't know.
I feel like running.

20:28.299 --> 20:29.966
Hey, Coach, you want
to show me how?

20:30.001 --> 20:31.902
- How to run?
- Come on. Coach me!

20:31.936 --> 20:34.771
Is this right, Coach?
Am I doing it right?

20:34.806 --> 20:36.873
Miller, you sorry excuse
for a human being,

20:36.908 --> 20:38.809
you are shaped like
a bean bag chair!

20:38.843 --> 20:40.243
I will sit in you!

20:40.278 --> 20:42.479
- Ah, you can do it.
- WINSTON: I'm coming, too.

20:42.513 --> 20:45.579
'Cause I ain't a quitter!
Ironside!

20:46.284 --> 20:48.051
I'm coming. I'm com...

20:48.085 --> 20:49.386
Aah!

20:49.420 --> 20:50.921
I am all-terrain, baby.

20:50.955 --> 20:52.789
I was wrong about you, okay?
You're not a quitter.

20:52.824 --> 20:53.924
(whooping)

20:53.958 --> 20:55.158
Now, please, quit!

20:55.159 --> 20:57.427
I'm glad I got to see that.
(laughs)

20:57.461 --> 20:59.396
Oh, Schmidt,

20:59.430 --> 21:00.897
here's your key back.

21:00.932 --> 21:03.866
We kind of like
having you around.

21:06.731 --> 21:08.036
Thanks.

21:08.621 --> 21:11.928
This is just a copy, though.
I have like 50 of them at home.

21:12.117 --> 21:15.011
- What are you doing to me?
- Your students are burying Winston.

21:15.012 --> 21:16.047
Nah, he likes it.

21:16.048 --> 21:18.316
Get away from me!
Where are your parents at?

21:18.341 --> 21:20.341
Shoo, children, shoo!

21:21.404 --> 21:23.910
Away now, be away!

21:24.356 --> 21:26.356
Shut up, Winston!

21:27.112 --> 21:30.578
- They are so mean!
- This is Karma...
