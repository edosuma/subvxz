[ All groaning ]

00:04.505 --> 00:07.773
Dad, you make
the best ribs on the planet.

00:07.775 --> 00:11.043
Thank you, baby.
My secret is whiskey.

00:11.045 --> 00:13.145
When I'm cooking,
I drink a lot of whiskey.

00:13.147 --> 00:14.880
Yeah.

00:14.882 --> 00:17.316
Yeah, I can never enjoy
feasting on the flesh

00:17.318 --> 00:19.551
of a creature
as intelligent as a pig.

00:19.553 --> 00:21.020
Pigs aren't that smart.

00:21.022 --> 00:23.922
Only one in three knows how to
build a house out of bricks.

00:25.326 --> 00:27.559
Still, I'll stick to
Mike's delicious greens.

00:27.561 --> 00:29.561
Which I cook
in bacon grease.

00:33.167 --> 00:35.000
Ah, hey, thanks again
for letting us have

00:35.002 --> 00:36.735
Boyd's birthday party here
next weekend.

00:36.737 --> 00:38.404
Oh, it's our pleasure.

00:38.406 --> 00:40.239
Hey, I even made
goody bags.

00:40.241 --> 00:42.307
In fact,
they came out so good,

00:42.309 --> 00:45.677
one might even call them
"great-y" bags.

00:45.679 --> 00:48.180
Why didn't I go away
to college?

00:48.182 --> 00:49.314
Your mom
went to college,

00:49.316 --> 00:51.283
and she still says
stuff like that.

00:51.685 --> 00:53.585
Yeah, we wanted to have
the party at out place,

00:53.587 --> 00:55.587
but the yard's not big enough
for the bouncy house.

00:55.589 --> 00:57.489
Bouncy castle.

00:57.491 --> 00:59.224
Boyd, we've
talked about this.

00:59.226 --> 01:01.226
I'm not comfortable
with bouncy castle.

01:01.228 --> 01:02.895
It glorifies
an oppressive class system,

01:02.897 --> 01:04.730
so if you want to bounce,
you're gonna have to do it

01:04.732 --> 01:06.865
in a sensible house.

01:06.867 --> 01:08.767
You know, Ryan,
there's a point when even

01:08.769 --> 01:10.502
Karl Marx would slap you.

01:12.273 --> 01:14.039
Yeah, I still
can't believe everyone

01:14.041 --> 01:16.241
is burying the headline
about Boyd's birthday.

01:16.243 --> 01:18.177
Right, right.
You know, there just might

01:18.179 --> 01:20.979
be an appearance by Vaness-o.

01:22.416 --> 01:25.884
The clean-up-can-be-fun clown.

01:25.886 --> 01:27.219
Uh, that's not
a headline, Mom.

01:27.221 --> 01:29.288
That's a nightmare.

01:29.290 --> 01:30.956
Look, it's
a Baxter family tradition

01:30.958 --> 01:33.525
that on your 10th birthday,
you get a rifle and go hunting.

01:33.527 --> 01:34.960
Really?
Yep, yep, yep, yep.

01:34.962 --> 01:36.595
I'm sorry, what?

01:36.597 --> 01:39.131
A gun? Hunting?
No. Absolutely not.

01:39.133 --> 01:43.235
Well, Vaness-o, do you want
to clean up this little mess?

01:43.237 --> 01:46.105
Look, I don't want Boyd
thinking that violence is fun.

01:46.107 --> 01:48.073
Now I'm gonna go outside
and figure out where to hang

01:48.075 --> 01:49.875
the Donald Trump piñata.

01:52.146 --> 01:53.745
You said you were gonna say
something to him about this.

01:53.747 --> 01:55.647
Yeah, well, I was.

01:55.649 --> 01:57.649
But then I realized,
I don't really like

01:57.651 --> 02:00.619
arguing with Ryan
and you do, so tag.

02:00.621 --> 02:02.621
You're it.

02:02.623 --> 02:03.889
It's getting
harder and harder

02:03.891 --> 02:07.059
to put weapons
in the hands of children.

02:07.061 --> 02:09.895
-- Captions by VITAC --

02:16.303 --> 02:17.936
I'm not changing
my mind, Mike.

02:17.938 --> 02:19.505
Boyd's not going hunting.

02:19.507 --> 02:20.506
Look, I was gonna
talk to you about this.

02:20.508 --> 02:21.673
I just wanted to
find the right time,

02:21.675 --> 02:25.144
but...I don't like
talking to you.

02:25.146 --> 02:26.979
Great, 'cause there's
nothing to talk about.

02:26.981 --> 02:27.913
Actually, there is.

02:27.915 --> 02:29.481
Getting a gun
on your 10th birthday

02:29.483 --> 02:31.917
is a Baxter family
tradition.

02:31.919 --> 02:33.152
Yeah, okay.
Let me see.

02:33.154 --> 02:34.686
It all started way back

02:34.688 --> 02:37.856
with your great-great
grandfather Jebediah Baxter,

02:37.858 --> 02:39.625
who by the age of 10,
had hunted

02:39.627 --> 02:41.660
everything in the forest
that could walk, crawl,

02:41.662 --> 02:44.530
or sing a song.

02:44.532 --> 02:48.934
Actually, his name was Bill,
and he made soap.

02:48.936 --> 02:51.637
All of the girls got guns
on their 10th birthday,

02:51.639 --> 02:54.940
even Mandy, once I found
a gun that matched her top.

02:54.942 --> 02:57.442
Hey, guys. There's pie.

02:57.444 --> 02:59.711
Everybody here
is pro-pie, right?

02:59.713 --> 03:01.880
You're dad is trying to
convince me to arm our son.

03:01.882 --> 03:04.516
This is why I don't
like talking to you.

03:04.518 --> 03:07.186
Sweetie, "arming" is kind of
a strong word for

03:07.188 --> 03:09.188
going on a fun hunting trip
with your grandpa.

03:09.190 --> 03:11.290
Wait. What? Sorry.
You're okay with this?

03:11.292 --> 03:12.057
Some of my best
childhood memories

03:12.059 --> 03:13.625
are hunting with my dad.

03:13.627 --> 03:16.695
You bond, learn patience,
respect for nature.

03:16.697 --> 03:18.897
Okay, but why does it have to
end with a dead animal?

03:18.899 --> 03:22.868
Because
that's the fun part.

03:22.870 --> 03:24.403
And it's a tradition.

03:24.405 --> 03:25.971
It always made me
feel really special.

03:25.973 --> 03:28.507
I am so sick of these
Baxter family traditions.

03:28.509 --> 03:30.709
Can't we just have
totally new traditions?

03:30.711 --> 03:34.680
Maybe you should look up
the definition of tradition.

03:34.682 --> 03:37.416
Look, you can make
the call on this one,

03:37.418 --> 03:40.519
and I really don't like
arguing with my dad, so tag.

03:40.521 --> 03:42.854
You're it.

03:42.856 --> 03:44.990
Great, you are not
taking my sweet, innocent son

03:44.992 --> 03:46.858
into the woods
to slaughter an animal.

03:46.860 --> 03:48.594
If you tell him
he can't go hunting,

03:48.596 --> 03:50.429
he's gonna know it was fun,
then he'll resent you

03:50.431 --> 03:51.430
for not letting him go.

03:51.432 --> 03:52.664
That's ridiculous.

03:52.666 --> 03:54.366
No, no! Like he would if
he wanted to take ballet.

03:54.368 --> 03:55.434
You say no to that,
he'll probably

03:55.436 --> 03:57.769
wear a tutu
the rest of his life.

03:57.771 --> 04:00.072
He's already
taking ballet lessons.

Yeah?

You're giving your 10-year-old
nephew a deviled egg platter?

04:30.771 --> 04:34.273
No, I'm giving him
a flying saucer!

04:34.275 --> 04:36.441
Whooo!

04:36.443 --> 04:40.545
With sleeping pods
for 12 aliens.

04:40.547 --> 04:42.547
You don't want to give Boyd
something from your shower.

04:42.549 --> 04:45.917
Uh, yes I do.
I just don't want to wrap it.

04:45.919 --> 04:47.653
So, uh, did you
and your dad pick out

04:47.655 --> 04:49.488
a song to dance to
at the wedding?

04:49.490 --> 04:53.558
No, Mom. Ixnay on
the father-daughter dance...

04:53.560 --> 04:55.360
Nay.

04:56.764 --> 04:59.564
Okay, what? And why?

04:59.566 --> 05:02.100
Because that leads to talking
about the mother-son dance,

05:02.102 --> 05:04.136
and Kyle doesn't
have a mom, Mom.

05:04.138 --> 05:06.004
Try to be sensitive.

05:06.006 --> 05:07.906
You are so sweet,
Mandy.

05:09.977 --> 05:11.910
But it's okay.
I mean, I have a mom.

05:11.912 --> 05:13.979
I just don't know
where she is.

05:13.981 --> 05:18.450
It's fine. It's like, um --
like "Where's Waldo," you know?

05:18.452 --> 05:22.521
Yeah, but except Waldo's
my mom, and Waldo is hammered.

05:22.523 --> 05:25.524
Kyle, you should get some
time in the spotlight, too.

05:25.526 --> 05:28.260
I mean, I'd be happy
to dance with you.

05:28.262 --> 05:29.828
Oh, that --
No, that's okay.

05:29.830 --> 05:32.364
What? Are you afraid
I might out-dance you?

05:36.970 --> 05:39.438
Mmm, no.

He's not. No one is.

Come on.

05:42.843 --> 05:45.010
Come on, Kyle.
You deserve this.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.878
You can pick
any dance you want.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.680
Come on,
you can't say no.

05:48.682 --> 05:51.383
[ Sighs ] Well, okay,
but only if we can do

05:51.385 --> 05:53.485
the Argentinean Tango.

05:53.487 --> 05:55.721
Okay. Uh, I'm game.
Is it hard?

05:55.723 --> 05:56.888
Well, if you don't
know how to do it,

05:56.890 --> 05:58.490
I mean, maybe this isn't
such a good idea.

05:58.492 --> 05:59.825
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no. No, no.

05:59.827 --> 06:01.159
I got this, all right.

06:01.161 --> 06:03.795
I learned the chicken dance
in, like, three days, so...

06:05.899 --> 06:08.467
Any chance you want to do
the chicken dance instead?

06:11.538 --> 06:13.672
Oh, boy.

06:13.674 --> 06:15.707
I think this is my favorite
part of the birthday party --

are gone.

06:18.145 --> 06:20.479
[ Gasps ]
What is it?

06:20.481 --> 06:23.648
It is
a deviled egg tray.

06:23.650 --> 06:26.852
It's for eggs that are evil.

06:26.854 --> 06:28.920
-Cool!
-Yeah.

06:28.922 --> 06:31.056
I'm gonna open
the big one now.

Oh, my God!

06:37.498 --> 06:39.197
Mike, what
were you thinking?

06:39.199 --> 06:42.601
I didn't get him that.
I thought our gift was the yard.

06:42.603 --> 06:43.735
Eve, what
were you thinking?

06:43.737 --> 06:45.404
I wouldn't give him
that baby gun.

06:45.406 --> 06:46.905
I'd give him
a good-old 12-gauge.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.607
You know, something
he can grow into.

06:50.277 --> 06:52.677
It's from me.

07:01.221 --> 07:03.622
Ryan, you gave Boyd
the shotgun?

07:03.624 --> 07:05.724
Yes, I did.

07:05.726 --> 07:10.061
Wow! You spent 10 years
setting up that surprise.

07:10.063 --> 07:12.130
What other surprise
do you have?

07:12.132 --> 07:15.467
A "Make America Great Again" hat
filled with pork chops?

07:15.469 --> 07:17.636
Honey, did, uh --
did you know about this?

07:17.638 --> 07:20.105
Yes, but he asked me
to keep it a secret,

07:20.107 --> 07:22.207
like that time he told me he
thought Sarah Palin was pretty.

at Outdoor Man.

Where we sell this gun for
a whole bunch less than this.

let's start cleaning up.

07:55.776 --> 07:57.909
Yeah, you really did.

that to sound so surprised.

[ Chuckles ]

08:03.317 --> 08:04.783
What are you up to?

08:04.785 --> 08:07.519
Nothing.
I realized you were right.

08:07.521 --> 08:09.087
See, if I don't
let Boyd hunt,

08:09.089 --> 08:11.189
it's always gonna be the thing
he wants to do most in his life.

08:11.191 --> 08:13.458
This way, I let him go,
I even get him the gun,

08:13.460 --> 08:15.494
and for once,
I'm not the bad guy.

08:15.496 --> 08:19.197
But you're so good at it.

08:19.199 --> 08:22.634
There may be a flaw
in your little plan.

08:22.636 --> 08:24.536
You don't want the kid
to go hunting.

08:24.538 --> 08:26.505
Oh, he won't.

08:26.507 --> 08:28.306
See, he likes the idea
of hunting, but once there's

08:28.308 --> 08:29.941
an actual living animal
in front of him,

08:29.943 --> 08:31.443
he's not gonna be able
to pull the trigger.

08:31.445 --> 08:34.312
100 years of Baxter tradition
says you're wrong.

08:34.314 --> 08:35.714
He's not gonna hunt, Mike.

08:35.716 --> 08:37.949
Well, I say he will.

08:37.951 --> 08:39.618
And we'll figure out
who's the winner

08:39.620 --> 08:42.487

that pheasant he and I bag.

08:42.489 --> 08:44.689
Oh, no.
I am going with you

'cause I cannot wait
to see that look on your face

when he ends
the Baxter tradition

of blowing holes
in living creatures.

08:51.331 --> 08:53.198
All right, all right.
Even better.

I added a booty bump
during the rap medley

19:50.190 --> 19:52.356
so [Clicks tongue] -- let's go.

19:53.860 --> 19:55.860
Booty bump, huh?

19:55.862 --> 19:58.696
I'm a really good dad.

20:05.972 --> 20:08.206
Hey, there. Mike Baxter
here for Outdoor Man.

20:08.208 --> 20:09.840
I know what you're thinking.

20:09.842 --> 20:13.311
"Mike, you taught us hunting,
and fishing, and climbing.

20:13.313 --> 20:17.915
When are you gonna teach us
quantum electro-dynamics?"

20:17.917 --> 20:20.484
Maybe I already have.

20:20.486 --> 20:22.553
Let me explain.

20:22.555 --> 20:24.655
When a beam of light
hits the water,

20:24.657 --> 20:26.857
no matter what angle of entry,

20:26.859 --> 20:30.494
light always takes the path
that requires the shortest time.

20:30.496 --> 20:32.997
Richard Feynman taught us that.

20:32.999 --> 20:35.499
How does light know
the shortcut?

20:35.501 --> 20:38.269
It's like it's already done it.

20:38.271 --> 20:40.171
Like it's already happened.

20:40.173 --> 20:42.373
♪ Ooh-eee-ooh ♪

20:42.375 --> 20:45.209
Light is pretty creepy.

20:45.211 --> 20:47.778
And very predictable.

20:47.780 --> 20:50.014
Our kids, not so much.

20:50.016 --> 20:52.617
No matter how hard we try
to bend them to our will,

20:52.619 --> 20:54.685
we have no idea
where those little rays of light

20:54.687 --> 20:55.853
are gonna go.

20:55.855 --> 20:57.755
But that's okay.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.757
Take the case of Jack Reagan --

20:59.759 --> 21:03.694
A heavy drinker
and even worse, a Democrat.

21:03.696 --> 21:05.730
One night, his son Ronnie
has to lift his father

21:05.732 --> 21:07.798
out of the snow
and lug him into the house.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.367
Ugh!

21:09.369 --> 21:11.202
Even back then,
Democrats expected

21:11.204 --> 21:14.071
someone else to carry them.

21:14.073 --> 21:15.640
The good news for our country,

21:15.642 --> 21:18.276
Ronald Reagan
was nothing like Jack.

21:18.278 --> 21:20.544
Yeah, sometimes
the worst thing that can happen

21:20.546 --> 21:24.282
is when a son turns out
to be like his dad.

21:24.284 --> 21:27.418
Just look at that fat kid
who runs North Korea.

21:27.420 --> 21:28.619
