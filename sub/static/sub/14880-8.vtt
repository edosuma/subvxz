00:00.482 --> 00:02.206
<i>Previously on</i>
Covert Affairs...

00:02.389 --> 00:04.624
Simon is a master spy.

00:04.626 --> 00:06.826
Get intimate enough with a man
and he'll tell you everything.

00:06.828 --> 00:08.995
I like you quite a bit more
than you might believe.

00:08.997 --> 00:11.697
Where are you going?
Bahamas? Caymans?

00:11.699 --> 00:16.436
Cuba.
Still interested?

00:16.438 --> 00:18.271
So he killed his handler,

00:18.273 --> 00:19.739
and he did it
to protect you.

00:19.741 --> 00:21.541
He's in love with you.

00:21.543 --> 00:23.009
The D.C.I.'s put me
on the trilateral commission

00:23.011 --> 00:25.077
looking into Jai's death.

00:25.079 --> 00:27.113
People think I murdered
my own son?

00:27.115 --> 00:28.347
I understand the mountain
of pressure you're under

00:28.349 --> 00:29.982
to make headway,
and I think I can help.

00:29.984 --> 00:32.084
Absolutely not.

00:32.086 --> 00:35.087
Chantilly Lofts,
Unit 317.

00:35.089 --> 00:38.524
The location
of Jai's safe house.

00:45.633 --> 00:47.867
You okay?

00:47.869 --> 00:50.169
Yeah. Sorry, I'm just
a little jet-lagged.

00:50.171 --> 00:52.138
Can you tell me
why we're here?

00:52.140 --> 00:54.006
What, an evening
in suburban Fairfax

00:54.008 --> 00:55.975
isn't your idea
of a dream date?

00:57.212 --> 01:00.847
This is Jai's safe house.

01:00.849 --> 01:02.281
You found Jai's
safe house?

01:02.283 --> 01:04.382
With a little help
from his dad.

01:04.385 --> 01:06.152
You talked
to Henry Wilcox?

01:06.154 --> 01:08.955
I thought Arthur took you off
the Jai investigation.

01:08.957 --> 01:10.790
He did, but I don't like
feeling like I failed,

01:10.792 --> 01:13.726
so I kept investigating
off-book.

01:13.728 --> 01:15.027
Does Arthur know
you talked to Henry?

01:15.029 --> 01:17.730
He expressly told me
not to.

01:17.732 --> 01:19.332
Aren't you worried
you're gonna get caught?

01:19.334 --> 01:22.869
Always.

01:22.871 --> 01:25.571
317.

01:25.573 --> 01:28.574
This is it.

Advertise your product or brand here

02:01.575 --> 02:03.643
I take it
from your stunned silence

02:03.645 --> 02:05.344
that we're in the right place.

02:11.919 --> 02:13.052
Jai must have been running

02:13.054 --> 02:16.022
some kind of long-term
investigation.

02:18.492 --> 02:20.660
Whatever it was,
he felt like he needed

02:20.662 --> 02:23.329
to keep the evidence
off-site.

02:31.371 --> 02:32.672
This must be what he wanted
to show me

02:32.674 --> 02:34.206
the day he was killed.

02:34.208 --> 02:37.209
This must be
what got him killed.

02:53.360 --> 02:56.362
Did you find something?

03:00.334 --> 03:02.335
Annie.

03:52.353 --> 03:54.453
Start talking.

03:54.455 --> 03:57.456
We thought you'd want
to see this for yourself.

04:03.997 --> 04:05.431
Good morning.

04:05.433 --> 04:08.200
There's nothing good
about being dragged out of bed

04:08.202 --> 04:11.203
at 3:30 in the morning.

04:16.642 --> 04:18.644
So on a scale
of one to ten,

04:18.646 --> 04:20.146
how big a deal is this?

04:20.148 --> 04:24.750
Knowing Jai, 12.

04:24.752 --> 04:26.218
Anybody else know
about this?

04:26.220 --> 04:27.319
No, sir. Just us.

04:27.321 --> 04:31.390
Don't forget
about Henry Wilcox.

04:31.392 --> 04:33.025
I was about to get
into that.

04:33.027 --> 04:35.961
Did you actually think
I wouldn't find out?

04:35.963 --> 04:38.397
A bit of advice, Auggie--
next time a superior

04:38.399 --> 04:41.100
gives you a direct order,
follow it.

04:41.102 --> 04:42.101
Auggie will be
riding back with me.

04:42.103 --> 04:43.402
It'll give us a chance
to chat.

04:43.404 --> 04:44.970
Can I drive?

04:44.972 --> 04:49.475
Pack all this up
and bring it back to Langley.

04:49.477 --> 04:50.509
Annie!

04:50.511 --> 04:51.644
I'm on it.

04:51.646 --> 04:54.680
My office...
three hours.

04:54.682 --> 04:57.316
No calls, no emails,
no sleep.

04:57.318 --> 04:59.318
Not until we get
to the bottom of this.

05:09.496 --> 05:11.697
Auggie, you've been privy
to Jai's O.S.P. files.

05:11.699 --> 05:13.866
Anything about his missions
stick out to you?

05:13.868 --> 05:16.635
Yeah, 6 out of 50 operations
have been compromised.

05:16.637 --> 05:18.404
Exactly. Jai believed
his missions were blown

05:18.406 --> 05:19.405
due to leaks.

05:19.407 --> 05:20.773
At the diner,
before Jai died,

05:20.775 --> 05:22.641
he claimed there was
a connection back to Langley.

05:22.643 --> 05:24.477
Hence the files
outside of Langley.

05:24.479 --> 05:26.579
Jai was tracking a man
by the name of Simon Fischer.

05:26.581 --> 05:29.582
Venture capitalist,
land developer, Russian spy.

05:29.584 --> 05:31.050
Fischer's one of the best.

05:31.052 --> 05:34.820
About an hour ago,
we intercepted a Russian cable.

05:34.822 --> 05:37.723
Fischer's here in D.C.
why?

05:37.725 --> 05:39.225
The question is why now?

05:39.227 --> 05:41.727
F.S.B. must have
a greater play in the area.

05:41.729 --> 05:43.429
We've got to proceed
under the assumption

05:43.431 --> 05:47.166
that he killed Jai.

05:47.168 --> 05:48.601
Finding Fischer's not
the top priority.

05:48.603 --> 05:51.203
It's our only priority.

05:54.941 --> 05:58.043
I can get to Simon Fischer.

05:58.045 --> 05:59.345
How?

05:59.347 --> 06:05.017
I've been developing him
as an asset for months.

06:05.019 --> 06:06.585
During that time,
I've gained access

06:06.587 --> 06:08.320
not only to his
operational strategy,

06:08.322 --> 06:10.122
but I've also gained
his trust.

06:10.124 --> 06:11.791
And we're just hearing
about this now?

06:11.793 --> 06:13.526
Is there anything else
you forgot to mention?

06:13.528 --> 06:15.694
The relationship's
become intimate.

06:15.696 --> 06:17.763
How intimate?

06:17.765 --> 06:20.199
I think
he's in love with me.

06:20.201 --> 06:23.035
How can you be certain his
feelings for you are genuine?

06:28.175 --> 06:29.608
He killed his handler
for me.

06:33.480 --> 06:35.614
I'm pretty sure I know
the answer to this question,

06:35.616 --> 06:38.984
but under whose directive
did this operation come about?

06:38.986 --> 06:40.419
All true.

06:40.421 --> 06:43.622
I oversaw all covert operations
related to Simon Fischer.

06:43.624 --> 06:45.758
Annie's mission was
under my direct purview.

06:45.760 --> 06:48.460
Annie hasn't worked
under your purview for a month.

06:48.462 --> 06:50.229
Also true.
I instructed Annie

06:50.231 --> 06:51.897
to maintain her relationship
with Simon

06:51.899 --> 06:53.265
even after she returned
to the D.P.D.

06:53.267 --> 06:55.267
Annie, maybe you'd like
to explain to me

06:55.269 --> 06:56.335
why you thought
it was a good--

06:56.337 --> 06:57.536
Don't blame Annie
for any of this.

06:57.538 --> 07:00.239
She was only following orders.
My orders.

07:00.241 --> 07:02.641
Which you stovepiped
from the rest of the building.

07:02.643 --> 07:05.244
That's the culture.
You know that.

07:05.246 --> 07:08.214
The intelligence gathered
was constant and reliable.

07:08.216 --> 07:10.482
The fact that I'm standing here
at seven-shitty in the morning

07:10.484 --> 07:12.985
means it was clearly
relevant.

07:12.987 --> 07:14.620
I'd also like to add
that Annie's tradecraft

07:14.622 --> 07:16.222
was nothing short
of remarkable.

07:16.224 --> 07:18.824
You're very lucky to have
such a talented operative

07:18.826 --> 07:20.025
back in your department.

07:20.027 --> 07:21.493
I want to see
a detailed timeline

07:21.495 --> 07:24.496
of the entire Fischer mission
on my desk by end of day.

07:24.498 --> 07:26.732
I'd better get to work.

07:30.036 --> 07:33.472
You can contact
Simon Fischer?

07:33.474 --> 07:34.707
Okay, Annie,
give him a call.

07:34.709 --> 07:37.142
Set up a meeting.
Something intimate.

07:37.144 --> 07:39.144
Auggie, put together
a skeleton team.

07:39.146 --> 07:40.546
We need to grab Fischer
quietly.

07:40.548 --> 07:45.651
I'd like to propose
an alternative strategy, sir.

07:45.653 --> 07:47.019
Okay.

07:47.021 --> 07:49.622
I've linked Simon
to a cellular jamming array

07:49.624 --> 07:51.290
currently under construction
in Cuba.

07:51.292 --> 07:54.093
The tech is designed
to disrupt communication

07:54.095 --> 07:55.694
within the United States.

07:55.696 --> 07:56.829
Oh, you're making
my case for me.

07:56.831 --> 07:58.330
A cooperative asset
always provides

07:58.332 --> 08:00.766
more reliable intel.

08:00.768 --> 08:02.501
Simon is a man
of integrity.

08:02.503 --> 08:03.836
If you want him
to cooperate,

08:03.838 --> 08:06.505
we need to treat him
with respect.

08:06.507 --> 08:09.275
Let me approach Simon.

08:09.277 --> 08:10.709
I can bring him in
willingly.

08:13.980 --> 08:17.316
Auggie, you, Annie,
and one tech support.

08:19.219 --> 08:22.488
Okay, Annie,
bring Fischer in.

Hi, Simon.

09:28.948 --> 09:30.148
I was just thinking
about you.

09:30.150 --> 09:33.384
We need to meet.
I know you're in D.C.

09:36.355 --> 09:39.257
Dinner?

09:39.259 --> 09:42.260
I was thinking,
like, now.

09:42.262 --> 09:44.028
How about Montrose Park?

09:44.030 --> 09:47.331
One hour?

09:47.333 --> 09:49.133
Noon.

09:49.135 --> 09:52.103
The Metro Center Mall.

09:52.105 --> 09:53.938
I read about it
in one of the guide books.

09:53.940 --> 09:58.242
Simon, I want--

09:58.244 --> 10:01.078
Metro Center Mall.

10:01.080 --> 10:03.080
Pretty hot.
What do you think?

10:03.082 --> 10:05.917
Proceed as directed.

10:05.919 --> 10:08.920
Proceed with caution.

10:15.861 --> 10:17.595
Joan.

10:17.597 --> 10:19.630
Lena.

10:24.136 --> 10:26.637
Making progress
on the timeline?

10:26.639 --> 10:29.674
I still have a few more files
to power through.

10:29.676 --> 10:31.609
Annie's very thorough
in her reports.

10:31.611 --> 10:32.777
You trained her well.

10:32.779 --> 10:34.645
Thank you.

10:34.647 --> 10:37.448
Look, I know you're upset,
but you should go easy on her.

10:37.450 --> 10:38.749
She was just doing
her job.

10:38.751 --> 10:40.785
I'm not upset with Annie.

10:40.787 --> 10:42.720
Well, you can't be mad
about the results.

10:42.722 --> 10:45.623
It's how you got them.
That's the problem.

10:45.625 --> 10:48.593
Your problem. And now that
Annie's back in the D.P.D.,

10:48.595 --> 10:51.963
they're my problem too.

10:51.965 --> 10:55.299
You're just mad that the win
wasn't under your watch.

10:55.301 --> 10:57.468
As long as I've known you,
you've always needed

10:57.470 --> 10:59.203
to be in control, Joan.

10:59.205 --> 11:01.372
Well, I guess
people just don't change.

11:01.374 --> 11:06.110
Look at you. No net.
No regard for the fallout.

11:06.112 --> 11:09.013
And there will be fallout
this time.

11:14.152 --> 11:17.521
Let's not make this more
complicated than it needs to be.

11:17.523 --> 11:20.091
Annie was transferred
into my division.

11:20.093 --> 11:22.126
I saw potential.
She showed initiative.

11:22.128 --> 11:23.628
When the opportunity
presented itself,

11:23.630 --> 11:25.162
she delivered.

11:25.164 --> 11:28.165
All she needed was
someone to trust her.

11:34.740 --> 11:35.940
- Arthur.
- Don't worry.

11:35.942 --> 11:38.242
I'll deal with Lena accordingly,
and Annie.

11:38.244 --> 11:40.177
That's not my concern
at the moment.

11:40.179 --> 11:42.146
A three-person team?

11:42.148 --> 11:43.948
If Simon Fischer is
such a threat,

11:43.950 --> 11:45.883
why aren't we casting
a wider net?

11:45.885 --> 11:47.451
I think we've gotta respect
Jai's approach.

11:47.453 --> 11:49.820
- Reckless ambition?
- Secrecy.

11:49.822 --> 11:51.322
He kept all this
information

11:51.324 --> 11:53.958
outside of Langley
for a reason--

11:53.960 --> 11:55.660
because he didn't know
who to trust.

11:55.662 --> 11:59.263
And the only one
we couldn't trust was Jai.

11:59.265 --> 12:01.332
Ever consider he might have
been in league with Fischer?

12:01.334 --> 12:03.434
Jai Wilcox sent
his own father to prison

12:03.436 --> 12:05.169
for leaking agency intel.

12:05.171 --> 12:09.974
Oh, he may have been an ass,
but he wasn't a traitor.

12:09.976 --> 12:12.643
Let's not forget
to mention paranoid.

12:12.645 --> 12:14.478
The guy blew up
in a car bomb.

12:14.480 --> 12:17.281
Seems to me his paranoia
was justified.

12:17.283 --> 12:21.052
Excuse me.

12:21.054 --> 12:23.654
Where are you going?

12:23.656 --> 12:26.190
To try and close
the circle.

12:38.437 --> 12:41.205
This better not count
as a conjugal visit.

12:41.207 --> 12:42.206
Your dance card full, Henry?

12:43.643 --> 12:46.344
Sit down.

12:46.346 --> 12:49.347
Rough morning, Arthur?

12:51.550 --> 12:52.550
Two minutes.

12:54.821 --> 12:58.856
You didn't need
to thank me in person.

12:58.858 --> 13:00.558
A handwritten note

13:08.101 --> 13:10.601
You find this amusing?

13:10.603 --> 13:14.071
- Hysterical.
- For Christ's sake, Henry.

13:14.073 --> 13:16.374
This is your own son's
murder investigation.

13:16.376 --> 13:20.010
Don't pretend
this is about justice.

13:20.012 --> 13:21.946
You're trying
to clean up your mess.

13:21.948 --> 13:22.947
What do you want?

13:22.949 --> 13:24.148
You got it backwards.

13:24.150 --> 13:27.151
I don't want anything.

13:30.355 --> 13:32.757
Tip the guards a few bucks

13:32.759 --> 13:35.760

13:40.966 --> 13:44.068
Actually, I do want something.

13:44.070 --> 13:46.370
I want to watch you squirm...

13:47.473 --> 13:50.474
when it all comes down
on you.

14:02.989 --> 14:05.289
- Signal status?
- Coming in on a beam.

14:05.291 --> 14:07.425
30 seconds or less.

14:07.427 --> 14:09.293
Designed this little guy
myself.

14:09.295 --> 14:13.264
Twice the range,
half the weight.

14:13.266 --> 14:15.433
Oh, now, you see?

14:15.435 --> 14:18.402
Most girls wouldn't trust
a blind guy with a safety pin.

14:18.404 --> 14:20.771
I was told these missions
might get dangerous.

14:20.773 --> 14:21.906
Don't worry, Annie.

14:21.908 --> 14:23.174
We've got ears on you
the entire time.

14:23.176 --> 14:24.608
Only audio.

14:24.610 --> 14:26.410
That's why Fischer picked
this location.

14:26.412 --> 14:28.245
Three levels,
hundreds of access points.

14:28.247 --> 14:30.247
Even if we had
a 15 member team,

14:30.249 --> 14:32.316
there'd be no way
to secure the perimeter.

14:32.318 --> 14:34.018
In other words,
I'm on my own out there.

14:34.020 --> 14:36.787
Those words exactly.
Now listen to me.

14:36.789 --> 14:38.456
You don't get eyes on him
in the first 15 minutes,

No, sit down.

- Yeah, I'm fine.

30:39.526 --> 30:40.725
At first I wasn't sure

30:40.727 --> 30:43.361
what that sound was,
but then it hit me.

30:43.363 --> 30:46.197
It's the heel of a shoe.

30:46.199 --> 30:50.001
Your shoe.

30:50.003 --> 30:51.069
Let me explain.

30:51.071 --> 30:53.171
Please do.

30:53.173 --> 30:55.907
What did you possibly have
to talk to Simon about

30:55.909 --> 30:58.910
in private
as you were fleeing gunfire?

31:01.413 --> 31:04.382
- You have to trust me.
- Always have.

31:04.384 --> 31:06.617
Tell me the truth.

31:06.619 --> 31:09.620
Did you let
Simon Fischer go?

31:18.565 --> 31:21.566
Do you love him, Annie?

31:25.037 --> 31:26.070
Auggie--

31:26.072 --> 31:29.073
Do you love him?

31:48.509 --> 31:51.243
Hey, Danielle.
It's me.

31:51.245 --> 31:55.514
Can you call me back tonight
if you get a chance?

31:55.516 --> 31:58.650
Send the girls my love.

31:58.652 --> 32:01.653
I miss you.

32:18.771 --> 32:20.505
Leo Brewer.
You should recognize him.

32:20.507 --> 32:22.107
He's an old acquaintance
of yours.

32:22.109 --> 32:24.376
Explosives expert,
assassin for hire.

32:24.378 --> 32:27.412
I know who he is.

32:27.414 --> 32:28.780
I made him.

32:28.782 --> 32:32.351
Last I heard, Brewer was rotting
in a Colombian prison.

32:32.353 --> 32:34.886
You're the one
who sent him on that mission

32:34.888 --> 32:37.289
and then turned your back on him
after he was captured.

32:37.291 --> 32:39.891
Is this really the best
you could dig up?

32:39.893 --> 32:43.161
Leo Brewer?

32:43.163 --> 32:45.297
It's like playing chess
with a third-grader.

32:45.299 --> 32:46.598
Brewer's dead.

32:46.600 --> 32:49.601
May he rest in peace.

32:54.607 --> 32:59.044
Spit it out.

32:59.046 --> 33:01.446
Brewer killed Jai.

33:04.150 --> 33:05.650
Bullshit.

33:05.652 --> 33:08.987
Analysts linked the purchase
of C-4 explosives by Brewer

33:08.989 --> 33:13.425
to residue found
under Jai's wheel well.

33:14.628 --> 33:16.862
I thought I should be
the one to tell you.

33:16.864 --> 33:18.363
Who ordered the hit?

33:18.365 --> 33:22.234
We think it was
the Russians.

33:22.236 --> 33:26.171
I'll tell you more
when I can.

33:26.173 --> 33:28.874
I'm sorry, Henry.

33:38.751 --> 33:40.786
Hi.

33:40.788 --> 33:42.521
You got a minute?

33:42.523 --> 33:45.624
For Annie Walker?
Got all day.

33:48.561 --> 33:50.128
Made quite a name
for yourself out there.

33:50.130 --> 33:52.631
I'm proud of you.

33:52.633 --> 33:57.102
I wouldn't pat me
on the back just yet.

33:57.104 --> 34:00.038
All things considered,
today was an utter failure.

34:00.040 --> 34:01.807
You got closer
than anyone ever has

34:01.809 --> 34:03.341
to a top F.S.B. operative.

34:03.343 --> 34:07.612
That's not something
to be taken lightly.

34:07.614 --> 34:11.081
Simon got away.

34:11.083 --> 34:13.552
Take a moment to recognize
what you've accomplished.

34:13.554 --> 34:18.290
You uncovered a cellular
jamming array in Cuba.

34:18.292 --> 34:21.659
Do you know how big
of a win this is?

34:21.661 --> 34:24.963
I'm taking my report
to the D.C.S. right now.

34:24.965 --> 34:27.065
You've solidified yourself

34:27.067 --> 34:29.668
as a top young operative
in the building.

34:29.670 --> 34:32.204
This time tomorrow, the halls
will be saying your name.

34:32.206 --> 34:35.172
They probably already are.

34:35.175 --> 34:37.342
At what cost?

34:37.344 --> 34:39.277
Hey.

34:39.279 --> 34:41.980
I would've made
the exact same decisions

34:41.982 --> 34:45.550
put in your position, okay?

34:45.552 --> 34:47.719
Go home.

34:47.721 --> 34:49.221
Tomorrow there'll be
a brand-new mission

34:49.223 --> 34:52.357
to throw yourself into.

35:04.237 --> 35:07.205
We need to talk.

35:09.976 --> 35:12.978
It's about Annie.

35:46.346 --> 35:48.647
Auggie. Change your mind
about that drink?

35:48.649 --> 35:51.116
- Where are you?
- Auggie?

35:51.118 --> 35:53.818
You need to come back
to Langley.

35:53.820 --> 35:55.053
It's been a long day.

35:55.055 --> 35:56.254
Do you think this could wait
till tomorrow?

35:56.256 --> 35:57.422
No, it can't.

35:57.424 --> 35:59.324
O.I.G. has a team
going through your desk.

35:59.326 --> 36:00.792
- Why? What's happening?
- I'm not sure,

36:00.794 --> 36:03.862
but you need to get back here
and get in front of this.

36:03.864 --> 36:05.397
Get in front of what?

36:08.402 --> 36:10.335
♪

36:10.337 --> 36:13.338
Uh, can I call you back?

36:13.340 --> 36:21.146
♪

36:21.148 --> 36:23.748
What are you doing here?

36:23.750 --> 36:26.751
I don't want
to lose you either.

36:36.183 --> 36:37.784
What are you doing here, Simon?

36:39.487 --> 36:42.355
I couldn't leave you.

36:45.292 --> 36:47.727
You're ready to turn yourself
in to the Agency?

36:47.729 --> 36:49.329
Tad late to walk in
waving the white flag,

36:49.331 --> 36:50.563
don't you think?

36:50.565 --> 36:52.298
There's a target
on your back.

36:52.300 --> 36:54.367
I mean, Langley can provide
asylum.

36:54.369 --> 36:57.337
I didn't come for asylum.

36:57.339 --> 37:00.773
I came for you.

37:00.775 --> 37:02.642
We can go in together.

37:02.644 --> 37:03.943
Annie.

37:03.945 --> 37:05.745
You can tell them
your side of the story.

37:05.747 --> 37:07.480
What story? I--

37:07.482 --> 37:09.749
I've never even seen
my contact's face.

37:09.751 --> 37:11.184
You can trade them
for other intel.

37:11.186 --> 37:13.386
Cuba and the listening array.

37:13.388 --> 37:17.990
I've been a spy
virtually all my life.

37:17.992 --> 37:22.228
Distrustful ever since
I was a boy.

37:22.230 --> 37:24.597
And I'm tired of the lies.

37:24.599 --> 37:26.232
It's just part of the game.

37:26.234 --> 37:27.800
Exactly. It's a game.

37:27.802 --> 37:29.235
One that we don't even play.

37:29.237 --> 37:32.605
We just get moved around
like chess pieces.

37:32.607 --> 37:34.607
There's more to it
than that.

37:39.780 --> 37:42.782
I hate to burst your bubble,
but no, there isn't.

37:47.688 --> 37:51.257
Come away with me.

37:51.259 --> 37:52.492
Leave this all behind.

37:52.494 --> 37:54.327
How?

37:54.329 --> 37:58.264
We work for two of the top
spy agencies in the world.

37:58.266 --> 37:59.632
They'd find us in weeks.

37:59.634 --> 38:01.367
There's a small island
off the Maldives,

38:01.369 --> 38:03.336
reachable only
by fishing boat.

38:03.338 --> 38:05.605
It's completely off the grid.

38:05.607 --> 38:07.473
I've spent the last ten years
steadily cultivating

38:07.475 --> 38:08.808
a false identity--

38:08.810 --> 38:10.877
bank statements, credit cards,
driver's license.

38:10.879 --> 38:12.278
It's rock-solid,

38:12.280 --> 38:15.615
and it'll provide cover
for you as well.

38:15.617 --> 38:18.885
Sounds like you really have
thought this through.

38:18.887 --> 38:22.522
Our flight into Dubai
leaves in the morning.

38:22.524 --> 38:24.323
Quick stop off to empty
a few bank accounts.

38:24.325 --> 38:28.528
We can be in Mali
the day after tomorrow.

38:28.530 --> 38:32.331
This is real.

38:32.333 --> 38:33.332
If you want it to be.

38:33.334 --> 38:35.001
It won't work.

38:35.003 --> 38:37.203
I've left nothing to chance.

38:37.205 --> 38:40.072
Everything's already in place.

38:40.074 --> 38:42.508
No more dancing around
who we are.

38:42.510 --> 38:45.011
No more lies.

38:45.013 --> 38:48.414
We can be together.

38:48.416 --> 38:49.749
How would we live?

38:49.751 --> 38:52.752
Better than now,
living for other people.

38:56.557 --> 39:00.927
We can live for each other.

39:00.929 --> 39:03.930
I want to live for you.

39:15.209 --> 39:18.211
