WEBVTT

00:07.214 --> 00:09.816
How you doing, Texas?
Staying frosty?

00:09.817 --> 00:11.418
Better get your game face on...

00:11.419 --> 00:13.720
'cause that's
the Venture Compound over there.

00:13.721 --> 00:16.189
Yeah, we lost a lot of good men
trying to take that hill.

00:16.190 --> 00:19.259
21, why are you wasting
your breath on the new meat?!

00:19.260 --> 00:21.294
Nine out of ten
don't even last a month!

00:21.295 --> 00:23.229
Attention, my coiled minions!

00:23.230 --> 00:25.298
Battle speech.
Smoke 'em if you got 'em.

00:25.299 --> 00:28.068
Coil, my bright
and bewinged army!

00:28.069 --> 00:32.772
Coil and prepare to strike
like the deadly sky-flowers you are!

00:32.773 --> 00:36.376
- This is making me feel a little gay.
- You, sir, are a big gay.

00:36.377 --> 00:39.412
...awaits the enemies
of the Mon-- What?!

00:39.413 --> 00:43.583
OK, so l'm getting the wrap-it-up signal.
Me, The Monarch.

00:43.584 --> 00:45.485
Yes, all right! Fine!

00:45.486 --> 00:49.479
Release the cloud
of deception/diversion!

00:49.523 --> 00:51.791
- Here we go!
- On your feet, Texas!

00:51.792 --> 00:55.328
- Go, go, go!
- Fly, my spangly vengeance!

00:55.329 --> 00:57.829
Fly to victory!

01:02.003 --> 01:04.503
Brock Samson!

01:44.145 --> 01:48.081
More power!
l must have more power!

01:50.284 --> 01:53.019
Look, Brock. His fingers!
They're twitching.

01:53.020 --> 01:56.690
Yeah, well, a stiff will do that
if you shove a gigavolt up its ass.

01:56.691 --> 02:00.525
No, he's alive!
Alive l tell you.

02:00.561 --> 02:02.595
Sure, Doc.

02:02.596 --> 02:04.597
Holy...

02:04.598 --> 02:07.567
Told ya. This is it, Brock,
The big one.

02:07.568 --> 02:10.478
The holy grail of super-science!

02:14.408 --> 02:17.002
Brock, cliché!

02:21.982 --> 02:26.932
Well, great. Just great.
Now you broke his whole head.

02:28.055 --> 02:31.224
Hey, there, bright eyes.
Feeling better?

02:31.225 --> 02:33.159
So, no hard feelings.

02:33.160 --> 02:36.663
l'll chalk your little strangle-tantrum
up to the surprise resurrection...

02:36.664 --> 02:39.766
and the adrenaline enema
and your basic criminal nature.

02:39.767 --> 02:42.368
Hey, pop, why is the top
of that guy's head black?

02:42.369 --> 02:44.671
Not black, Hank,
African American.

02:44.672 --> 02:47.640
The top of that guy's head
is African American.

02:47.641 --> 02:51.010
Dad, why is the top
of this guy's head African American?

02:51.011 --> 02:54.414
Because Brock caved in his original
cranium, and l had to use whatever fit.

02:54.415 --> 02:55.782
So, Brock killed him?

02:55.783 --> 02:57.917
And you brought him back to life?

02:57.918 --> 03:01.488
That's right, boys. Your father's
beating death at her own game.

03:01.489 --> 03:04.219
Father!

03:04.258 --> 03:06.326
No! No, no, no.

03:06.327 --> 03:09.160
- Father.
- Oh, no.

03:09.196 --> 03:12.832
Don't think of me
as your father. Please!

03:12.833 --> 03:16.773
l get enough of that noise
from these two.

03:19.907 --> 03:22.407
Darn! Out of gas.

03:22.710 --> 03:24.077
Hey, gang, dig this!

03:24.078 --> 03:27.981
Looks like some sort
of secret abandoned military base.

03:27.982 --> 03:30.416
Patriarchal white pig square's nest.

03:30.417 --> 03:34.287
Far out, Val. But something's fishy
in the state of Denmark.

03:34.288 --> 03:37.090
l can feel a mystery coming on.

03:37.091 --> 03:39.759
Ted, you said
l could see my parents.

03:39.760 --> 03:41.427
This was on the way, Patty.

03:41.428 --> 03:44.330
We've been driving
to my parents' house for ten years.

03:44.331 --> 03:46.232
- You promised.
- Patty...

03:46.233 --> 03:50.336
being out of your box isn't a right,
it's a privilege.

03:50.337 --> 03:53.973
Baby, you don't want to go
back in your box, do you?

03:53.974 --> 03:56.474
No.

03:58.145 --> 04:00.705
Sonny, Groovy, wake up!

04:00.748 --> 04:02.816
Mystery time.

04:02.817 --> 04:06.119
Please, Groov,
just say something to them.

04:06.120 --> 04:08.254
Say a ''hi'' or anything...

04:08.255 --> 04:10.323
just so they'll believe me.

04:10.324 --> 04:12.158
l'm not here to talk to them.

04:12.159 --> 04:14.661
You are the hand
chosen by the master.

04:14.662 --> 04:16.161
No!

04:16.163 --> 04:17.897
Yours is the Wheel of Blood.

04:17.898 --> 04:20.533
Yours is the sword of Michael.

04:20.534 --> 04:22.168
Hey, Sonny?

04:22.169 --> 04:23.236
Shut up!

04:23.237 --> 04:27.440
Shut up...damn it!
l can't hear myself think.

04:27.441 --> 04:29.108
Come on, Sonny. Mystery.

04:29.109 --> 04:32.476
...your mystery, man. l'm sick.

04:32.513 --> 04:34.214
Sonny?

04:34.215 --> 04:38.235
Bet you'll come out
for some Groovy treats.

04:41.121 --> 04:44.190
Why do we have to eat breakfast
with your dead guy?

04:44.191 --> 04:46.125
Venturestein has been
through a lot, Dean.

04:46.126 --> 04:47.927
- Venturestein!
- You like that?

04:47.928 --> 04:50.029
- Sure do, pop.
- Good boy, Hank.

04:50.030 --> 04:52.932
Dean? Right now,
Hank is better than you.

04:52.933 --> 04:57.270
Anywho, the next phase of my work
will be to socialize Venturestein...

04:57.271 --> 05:01.541
to help him make the transition from dead
guy to contributing member of society.

05:01.542 --> 05:04.344
Who says dead people
can't carry their own weight?

05:04.345 --> 05:06.679
And maybe some
of your stuff while they're at it.

05:06.680 --> 05:09.672
Dude!
Fly walking on your eye!

05:14.688 --> 05:16.823
l don't know about this, Ted.

05:16.824 --> 05:19.459
Patty, if God didn't want us
to solve this mystery...

05:19.460 --> 05:21.594
he wouldn't have had us
run out of gas here.

05:21.595 --> 05:23.596
But what's the mystery?

05:23.597 --> 05:26.299
You know?
We're not out of gas, man.

05:26.300 --> 05:30.036
We got a five-gallon can
in the back of the... Damn it!

05:30.037 --> 05:32.238
Why do you hate God so much?

05:32.239 --> 05:34.007
l don't hate God, man.

05:34.008 --> 05:37.410
Well, God thinks you hate Him.
And that's just as bad as hating Him.

05:37.411 --> 05:40.713
So, how about you and Groovy
go start looking for some clues.

05:40.714 --> 05:42.015
Clues to what?

05:42.016 --> 05:43.116
What is your trip?

05:43.117 --> 05:45.585
Clues to why l don't chain you
to the back of my van...

05:45.586 --> 05:50.523
and road-haul you till you're nothing
but a pelvis wearing a belt.

05:50.524 --> 05:53.564
Guy is pissing on your lawn, man.

06:02.303 --> 06:05.133
What?
What are you looking at?

06:06.407 --> 06:10.043
- Why does he gotta cry like that?
- l think you scare him.

06:10.044 --> 06:12.745
l'm not the one
who froze his corpse...

06:12.746 --> 06:14.847
or nuked him
back from the great beyond...

06:14.848 --> 06:17.951
to be a half-dead
short-bus seat-warmer.

06:17.952 --> 06:19.018
But you did kill him.

06:19.019 --> 06:21.421
And then when l unkilled him,
you kind of did it again.

06:21.422 --> 06:23.556
You hit him so hard
he's got an afro now.

06:23.557 --> 06:26.960
Yeah! You're like fire
to his Frankenstein.

06:26.961 --> 06:28.194
- Venturestein.
- Right!

06:28.195 --> 06:31.096
And Venturestein is all like...

06:31.131 --> 06:33.631
''Brock bad!''

06:38.605 --> 06:40.606
Mr. Venture, l caught you.

06:40.607 --> 06:43.609
- Yay.
- As per our landlord-tenant agreement...

06:43.610 --> 06:46.746
l come to inform you
of a small gathering l will host...

06:46.747 --> 06:50.917
from say 5:00 in the post-meridian
until question mark.

06:50.918 --> 06:52.452
Whatever.
Knock yourself out.

06:52.453 --> 06:55.455
Any and all who hunger
to know the secrets of self...

06:55.456 --> 07:00.293
which stud like internal suns
in the inky lattice-work of our very minds...

07:00.294 --> 07:03.629
may join us
in our purgative journey of...

07:03.630 --> 07:06.130
ls that man dead?

07:06.166 --> 07:07.200
No.

07:07.201 --> 07:11.204
Once again, Mr. Venture
you cut decency to the quick...

07:11.205 --> 07:14.107
and leave her to die
in prostitute alley!

07:14.108 --> 07:16.309
Prostitoo!

07:16.310 --> 07:17.310
Prostitute.

07:17.311 --> 07:20.371
- Prostitoo!
- Prostitute.

07:20.414 --> 07:23.449
Brock, you're a man
of no small character.

07:23.450 --> 07:26.152
- What say you on this?
- Not really my department.

07:26.153 --> 07:30.556
But we two souls have shared
a cheese sandwich more than twice...

07:30.557 --> 07:33.593
and the stitched together quilt
of your stony silences...

07:33.594 --> 07:37.086
forms a tapestry
of quiet desperation.

07:37.131 --> 07:38.297
No, it doesn't.

07:38.298 --> 07:42.029
You are truly
a Grim Reaper, my friend.

07:42.069 --> 07:46.139
But when you need to talk,
l will be there.

07:47.808 --> 07:50.308
All right then.

07:50.878 --> 07:53.378
Brock bad.

07:54.114 --> 07:56.742
Good! Suffixed consonants!

07:56.784 --> 07:59.284
Good!

08:00.187 --> 08:02.712
Brock bad!

08:03.590 --> 08:05.425
And that's the problem
with men, Patty.

08:05.426 --> 08:08.961
The Y-gene is just
an incomplete X-chromosome, dig?

08:08.962 --> 08:12.231
A man is an incomplete female.
Just a walking abortion.

08:12.232 --> 08:15.334
Gosh! l hope Ted lets me
take a shower soon.

08:15.335 --> 08:18.775
Zip it, gang.
Something's going down.

08:20.441 --> 08:22.941
Oh, my God!

08:23.811 --> 08:26.311
Who is Héctor Molina...

08:26.313 --> 08:29.749
and why do they keep
sending me his junk mail?

08:29.750 --> 08:31.084
Heads up, kids.

08:31.085 --> 08:35.455
Think we may have stumbled
onto a Dracula factory.

08:35.456 --> 08:37.924
Where the heck did they put
African America?

08:37.924 --> 08:39.125
l don't know, Hank...

08:39.126 --> 08:41.193
but it's not
on any of my charts.

08:41.195 --> 08:43.429
l know. To the learning beds!

08:43.429 --> 08:46.899
Dude, l am not getting in that thing
with stinky old Venturestein.

08:46.900 --> 08:48.601
What's he doing
in there anyway?

08:48.602 --> 08:50.970
Dad said he needs
to socialize him?

08:50.971 --> 08:55.271
Stand by
for Part 7-B of Volume One.

08:55.309 --> 08:57.276
Take this time to reflect...

08:57.277 --> 09:00.279
Who's down
in the old manufacturing wing?

09:00.280 --> 09:01.380
l'll get the flashlight!

09:01.381 --> 09:04.421
l'll get the astronaut ice cream!

09:12.926 --> 09:16.157
Hi! l'm Everyday Joe!

09:16.196 --> 09:20.533
l speak for you because...
Well, heck, l am you!

09:20.534 --> 09:23.769
And sometimes
l catch both of us wondering...

09:23.770 --> 09:27.370
''Hey, what's good
about child labor?''

09:28.809 --> 09:30.309
Yes, General Manhowers.

09:30.310 --> 09:33.779
My Venturesteins could be
easily adapted to ground warfare.

09:33.780 --> 09:38.084
l suppose their chest cavities
could hold quite a lot of C4, certainly.

09:38.085 --> 09:40.585
That many?
No, of course!

09:41.522 --> 09:45.232
No, that's wonderful,
General. Wonderful!

09:45.792 --> 09:49.295
Good. Everything's
going my way, finally.

09:49.296 --> 09:52.466
Cross that off the old to do list.

09:57.271 --> 09:59.771
Come on!

10:03.911 --> 10:06.411
Come on.

10:16.890 --> 10:20.910
Look, grandpa!
l made a shoe all by myself!

10:22.429 --> 10:26.432
Little Jorge knows
the satisfaction of a job well done...

10:26.433 --> 10:28.000
and so can you!

10:28.001 --> 10:30.703
Just watch
and listen carefully...

10:30.704 --> 10:35.441
and soon you'll be ready
for a career in bonded servitude!

10:35.442 --> 10:39.332
- See you in a jiffy!
- Vivan los zapatos!

10:40.447 --> 10:42.947
Prostitoo!

10:45.085 --> 10:47.585
Prostitoo!

10:49.291 --> 10:51.791
Brock!

10:52.360 --> 10:56.831
Think l might be
a tapestry of quiet desperation.

10:56.832 --> 10:59.332
Excellent!

11:05.074 --> 11:06.107
Everyone!

11:06.108 --> 11:09.611
The sacred death vine
ceremony is about to begin.

11:09.612 --> 11:11.880
Allow me to introduce
our guide...

11:11.881 --> 11:15.749
Don Rio lmpossible lsabanco...

11:15.785 --> 11:19.515
one of the Amazon's
most learned shaman.

11:20.523 --> 11:22.290
l can feel it, friends!

11:22.291 --> 11:26.061
Tonight will be a night
of great healing and human oneness.

11:26.062 --> 11:28.912
l'm not sure this is my scene.

11:33.936 --> 11:38.100
Correction!
Dracula-Frankenstein factory!

11:39.608 --> 11:42.110
The few remaining men
will exist as studs...

11:42.111 --> 11:43.712
breeding in the cow pasture.

11:43.713 --> 11:46.247
Or they could go off
to the nearest suicide center...

11:46.248 --> 11:48.516
where they'll be quietly
gassed to death.

11:48.517 --> 11:50.986
Come on, guys!

11:50.987 --> 11:53.487
Val, don't.

11:54.123 --> 11:57.625
Pray tell, Brock Samson,
you old so and so.

11:57.626 --> 12:00.962
What burden does your soul carry
to our sacred circle?

12:00.963 --> 12:03.832
l don't know.
Just not on my game today.

12:03.833 --> 12:06.825
Something's not...right.

12:10.106 --> 12:12.440
You are a child of the past.

12:12.441 --> 12:15.510
We must be children
of the future.

12:15.511 --> 12:17.846
- Hang on a sec. What?
- Brock.

12:17.847 --> 12:21.016
l need dead people.
Lots and lots of dead people.

12:21.017 --> 12:23.118
l've got twelve
with the henchmen you killed...

12:23.119 --> 12:25.053
not counting the black guy
with half a head.

12:25.054 --> 12:26.521
But we need
like 100-something.

12:26.522 --> 12:28.289
We need like a full gross
of dead people.

12:28.290 --> 12:31.693
Right, and...where are we gonna get
all these dead people?

12:31.694 --> 12:34.629
Well, l thought seeing as how you're...
you know, you and all...

12:34.630 --> 12:37.866
l thought...maybe...
you could go out and...

12:37.867 --> 12:38.933
-No.
- Make some...

12:38.934 --> 12:40.168
- No.
- ...dead people.

12:40.169 --> 12:41.469
- No.
- Well, fine!

12:41.470 --> 12:43.972
- Thanks a lot for not helping!
- Anything else?

12:43.973 --> 12:46.473
Help me get dead people!

12:50.179 --> 12:52.580
Soup's on, everyone!

12:52.581 --> 12:56.984
Painted lips.
Schoolgirl outfits.

12:57.019 --> 12:59.254
And the pretty hair, Sonny.

12:59.255 --> 13:02.057
The hair needs
to be punished, Sonny!

13:02.058 --> 13:04.059
Would ya give it a rest, Groov?

13:04.060 --> 13:06.628
Start doing
the master's bidding!

13:06.629 --> 13:09.731
You're already filthy
with wrath and sin!

13:09.732 --> 13:12.232
- Halt!
- Who goes there?!

13:14.970 --> 13:17.564
- ...God, wow!
- A hippie!

13:17.606 --> 13:20.756
- We better follow him!
- And how!

13:21.644 --> 13:25.747
- What is this?
- Liquid extract of the death vine.

13:25.748 --> 13:29.017
Your portal
to another world of consciousness.

13:29.018 --> 13:31.386
This some kind
of Jonestown deal?

13:31.387 --> 13:33.455
Let not the Dixie cup mislead you!

13:33.456 --> 13:37.292
The death vine will allow you
to shed your ego. Only then...

13:37.293 --> 13:41.362
can the repair
of your spiritual whole commence.

13:41.363 --> 13:43.863
What the hell.

13:44.033 --> 13:45.867
Sonny, Groovy!

13:45.868 --> 13:47.936
- There you are!
- Ted!

13:47.937 --> 13:49.104
l'm losing it, man!

13:49.105 --> 13:52.107
No Groovy treat
until you find a clue, dirtbag.

13:52.108 --> 13:54.476
l just saw those kids!

13:54.477 --> 13:55.944
What kids, Sonny?

13:55.945 --> 14:00.381
The squares from back in Baja
when l was all freaked!

14:00.382 --> 14:04.085
Don't you remember?!
Like, two years ago!

14:04.086 --> 14:06.754
Me and Groovy
had just run into something.

14:06.755 --> 14:10.758
Groov said it was a monitor lizard,
but l wasn't so sure.

14:10.759 --> 14:13.349
And then, all of a sudden...

14:25.040 --> 14:26.074
Sonny!

14:26.075 --> 14:27.509
What happened?!

14:27.510 --> 14:30.638
They freaked me, man. What?

14:30.679 --> 14:32.614
You think l need
this kind of heat?! Do you?!

14:32.615 --> 14:35.115
- l'm sorry!
- Do you?!

14:35.417 --> 14:37.685
Sonny, l swear
to the Lord God, my savior...

14:37.686 --> 14:41.089
l will kill the living...out of that dog!
Shut that dog up!

14:41.090 --> 14:42.991
No. No, no.

14:42.992 --> 14:44.592
lt's OK, Groovy.

14:44.593 --> 14:49.230
- l got to learn...
- Yeah. That's right. Learn what?

14:49.231 --> 14:51.599
Got to learn to respect...

14:51.600 --> 14:54.728
and not to harsh Ted's mellow.

14:54.770 --> 14:55.803
Boys?!

14:55.804 --> 14:59.874
Boys?! Brock got
the X-1 started. Let's go!

15:00.342 --> 15:02.610
Don't make me
come down there, boys!

15:02.611 --> 15:04.279
These are my dress-up shoes.

15:04.280 --> 15:06.080
Don't you see, Ted?

15:06.081 --> 15:09.175
They have to be ghosts...

15:09.218 --> 15:13.518
'cause l killed them!

15:15.758 --> 15:19.125
Yeah.
He was just this guy.

15:19.161 --> 15:23.798
A guy in a butterfly suit
who got in over his head.

15:23.799 --> 15:25.967
And l could see it in his eyes...

15:25.968 --> 15:29.003
that if l let him
get away this one time...

15:29.004 --> 15:31.905
he'd never come back. But...

15:31.941 --> 15:34.967
then l also thought,
you know...

15:35.010 --> 15:37.510
kill him.

15:41.150 --> 15:43.885
What kind of way is that to...

15:43.886 --> 15:45.954
One time...

15:45.955 --> 15:48.223
l'm on the Amazon in my canoe...

15:48.224 --> 15:51.352
and l see swim the dolphin...

15:53.495 --> 15:55.230
the beautiful dolphin...

15:55.231 --> 15:56.931
so, l slip out of my canoe...

15:56.932 --> 15:59.730
and l grab her...this fish...

16:01.036 --> 16:04.403
and then l...it, this fish!

16:04.440 --> 16:07.930
Hell's that got to do
with anything?!

16:08.310 --> 16:10.345
Hot dolphin!

16:10.346 --> 16:11.579
You're an idiot!

16:11.580 --> 16:14.782
Don Rio is a transcendent
multidimensional genius, Brock.

16:14.783 --> 16:17.452
His every word
an onion of infinite leaf...

16:17.453 --> 16:19.953
his every pearl...

16:23.192 --> 16:25.752
Yes. This is coming on...

16:25.794 --> 16:29.286
30,000 feet.
Cruising altitude.

16:29.331 --> 16:31.599
Oh, God!

16:31.600 --> 16:35.830
Feel like l got a stomach
full of drunk bees.

16:36.705 --> 16:38.406
Brock Samson...

16:38.407 --> 16:41.109
this is your chance
to find the way of peace...

16:41.110 --> 16:44.671
of positive
rainbow energization...

16:45.714 --> 16:47.215
and karmic repair.

16:47.216 --> 16:50.976
Dried up little Keebler!
You poisoned me!

16:51.220 --> 16:52.754
Venturestein?!

16:52.755 --> 16:54.422
Change of curriculum.

16:54.423 --> 16:57.413
You're going
to military school!

16:59.261 --> 17:01.761
Problemo.

17:02.598 --> 17:05.431
You know what?
l think l...

17:06.568 --> 17:09.771
l feel a little bad
about killing that guy.

17:09.771 --> 17:11.906
Yes, my friend.

17:11.906 --> 17:15.434
A splendid first step ind--

17:30.959 --> 17:33.459
All right!

17:33.729 --> 17:35.663
Yeah!

17:35.664 --> 17:37.899
Just cool out, Sonny.
Look.

17:37.900 --> 17:40.601
Val found some tools and crap
that l think we can sell.

17:40.602 --> 17:41.936
For money?

17:41.937 --> 17:44.272
- What are you doing?!
- Yeah! That's our dad's stuff!

17:44.273 --> 17:45.640
Get off our property!

17:45.641 --> 17:47.642
Sonny! You were right!

17:47.643 --> 17:51.010
And this dog...talks, man!

17:51.046 --> 17:53.014
Think these guys
have a screw loose, Hanker.

17:53.015 --> 17:54.048
Copy that.

17:54.049 --> 17:55.583
No, no! Sonny killed you.

17:55.584 --> 17:59.387
l'm telling you.
Like, they're ghosts, man!

17:59.388 --> 18:01.222
Only one way to find out.

18:01.223 --> 18:03.491
Super run-away!

18:03.492 --> 18:07.360
You see, Brock Samson,
we're all one.

18:07.396 --> 18:09.630
We all share
the same need...

18:09.631 --> 18:13.123
for shelter,
warmth, fulfillment.

18:13.168 --> 18:17.271
The secret of happiness,
lies not in conquest...

18:17.272 --> 18:19.772
but in empathy.

18:25.381 --> 18:26.948
Better dolphin!

18:26.949 --> 18:28.549
- Samson!
- Hunter?!

18:28.550 --> 18:31.986
What is all this nambi-pambi feel bad
about good wet-work moose crap?!

18:31.987 --> 18:34.222
You're beyond
good and evil, Superman!

18:34.223 --> 18:37.325
- You work for the Government.
- What about...

18:37.326 --> 18:41.695
humanity and empathy
and all that garbage?

18:41.730 --> 18:45.233
Who cares?
You're going to Special Ops heaven.

18:45.234 --> 18:48.002
- Really?
- Really! And it's...damn great!

18:48.003 --> 18:51.439
A G-Man Valhala!
There's trim and guns everywhere.

18:51.440 --> 18:54.075
We eat steak-flavored clouds
and poop secrets!

18:54.076 --> 18:57.078
But you're not even dead!
You're a woman.

18:57.079 --> 18:59.080
And you're a tool, boy. A tool!

18:59.081 --> 19:01.349
Built for a single purpose
by the United States...

19:01.350 --> 19:03.684
of shut your third...damn eye
for a...reason!

19:03.685 --> 19:06.053
You can't teach a hammer
to love nails, son.

19:06.054 --> 19:09.080
That dog don't hunt!

19:12.094 --> 19:14.858
Don't hunt!

19:18.534 --> 19:22.231
Don't hunt!

19:24.540 --> 19:26.541
l didn't think hippies had guns!

19:26.542 --> 19:29.210
They're probably,
like, pirate hippies!

19:29.211 --> 19:31.805
Find it, Groov.
Find it!

19:37.719 --> 19:41.055
Ghosts don't run away from bullets.
So, what are you?

19:41.056 --> 19:43.556
Ted! Like, look!

19:49.064 --> 19:51.726
Dean?! Dean?!

19:51.767 --> 19:55.294
- What is this?!
- Oh, Hank.

19:55.337 --> 19:56.671
You're not ghosts.

19:56.672 --> 19:59.422
You're the...boys from Brazil.

20:00.943 --> 20:03.044
Frankenstein!

20:03.045 --> 20:04.479
l want to go back to my mom!

20:04.480 --> 20:06.980
Prostitoo!

20:19.261 --> 20:20.895
No! Another one!

20:20.896 --> 20:23.564
- Don't hunt!
- Not so fast, los--

20:23.565 --> 20:24.832
Don't shoot me!

20:24.833 --> 20:26.901
- Oh, God!
- Oh, God!

20:26.902 --> 20:29.572
Mine is the sword of Michael!

20:32.574 --> 20:36.601
l'm so cold, man.
l'm so...cold.

20:36.645 --> 20:39.145
Oh, no.

20:42.317 --> 20:43.484
Well, Venturestein...

20:43.485 --> 20:46.153
l'd say that radioactive isotope
l put in your spine...

20:46.154 --> 20:48.055
is worth its weight
in radioactivity.

20:48.056 --> 20:49.457
- Doc!
- What's going on here?!

20:49.458 --> 20:51.492
lt's bad, Doc, real bad.

20:51.493 --> 20:55.229
The boys saw their own clones.
l think they're in some kind of...

20:55.230 --> 20:58.131
saw-your-own-clone coma.

20:59.234 --> 21:00.835
Boys! Get up!

21:00.836 --> 21:03.571
- Yes, sir!
- l hope you're proud of yourselves.

21:03.572 --> 21:05.206
You've...

21:05.207 --> 21:08.075
- You've ruined the surprise.
- The what?!

21:08.076 --> 21:11.979
This was going to be
your Christmas present.

21:11.980 --> 21:13.681
A whole big army of yous...

21:13.682 --> 21:17.385
ready to think you're the coolest,
and do your chores...

21:17.386 --> 21:21.489
maybe eliminate targets
in high-risk combat zones.

21:21.490 --> 21:24.292
But now you've ruined the surprise!

21:24.293 --> 21:26.460
So l'll have to think
of something even better.

21:26.461 --> 21:27.895
Even better?!

21:27.896 --> 21:32.934
Now, get upstairs, you little lndians,
and wash off all that Chicanery.

21:32.935 --> 21:35.435
Macaroni and cheese tonight!

21:35.604 --> 21:37.838
Dad, you're the best dad ever.

21:37.839 --> 21:40.339
Yes, l am.

21:43.178 --> 21:46.218
Two, plus...
Well, it's a start.

22:16.178 --> 22:18.179
Prostitoos!

22:18.180 --> 22:20.948
You got it, V-stein.
That's the game plan.

22:20.949 --> 22:23.084
- Shoe!
- Oh, no, man, no.

22:23.085 --> 22:26.687
They're not gonna give it up
for a shoe you made out of a dog.

22:26.688 --> 22:29.490
- Shoe.
- Forget it, V. lt's my treat.

22:29.491 --> 22:32.051
Brock good!

22:32.094 --> 22:35.063
Qué sopa más buena!
