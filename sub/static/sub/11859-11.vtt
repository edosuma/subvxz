WEBVTT

00:10.333 --> 00:11.417
Wow, look at that.

00:15.959 --> 00:17.583
Wow, stewardesses, Stuart.

00:17.667 --> 00:20.792
Should be in London
by 9 o'clock, Ally.

00:20.875 --> 00:22.792
In time for a
late supper.

00:22.875 --> 00:23.917
Wow!

00:25.667 --> 00:28.125
Can you believe it, Helen?

00:28.208 --> 00:29.333
We're jet-setters.

00:29.417 --> 00:30.583
Cheese steaks for lunch.

00:30.667 --> 00:32.417
'Shepherd's pie for dinner.'

00:32.500 --> 00:33.667
Big Ben, here we come.

00:33.750 --> 00:35.083
Are you a real,
live stewardess?

00:35.166 --> 00:36.542
Living and breathing.

00:36.625 --> 00:37.834
Can I take a picture with you?

00:37.917 --> 00:39.625
My best friend Sally
won't believe it.

00:39.709 --> 00:41.542
Give me the camera.
I'll take it.

00:41.625 --> 00:44.959
[giggling]
Okay, smile, Ally.

00:45.041 --> 00:46.291
Wow, thanks.

00:46.375 --> 00:48.500
Is it true you get to
fly
on airplanes every
day

00:48.583 --> 00:51.667
and meet lots of people and
go to Tokyo and California?

00:51.750 --> 00:53.500
All those things and more.

00:53.583 --> 00:55.834
It's the best job in the world.

00:55.917 --> 00:56.959
Thanks.

01:34.750 --> 01:37.458
(Rush)
What've you got, boss?

01:37.542 --> 01:39.333
(Stillman)
Place used to
be the Republican Hotel.

01:39.417 --> 01:40.959
Been vacant
since '72.

01:41.041 --> 01:42.917
(Valens)
A lot of work
going on upstairs.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.083
(Stillman)
'Developer just bought it,
turning it to condos.'

01:46.166 --> 01:48.709
Renovation crew
found human remains..

01:48.792 --> 01:50.166
...intact hip bone.

01:50.250 --> 01:51.875
CSU's thinking female.

01:52.917 --> 01:54.500
Dumped in the
old
incinerator.

01:54.583 --> 01:56.625
(Stillman)
'Hotels used to burn
their garbage.'

01:56.709 --> 01:58.500
What better
place
for a body?

01:58.583 --> 02:01.834
(CSU Tech)
Detective.

02:01.917 --> 02:04.875
Pin from an airline.

02:04.959 --> 02:07.500
"A. Thurston.

02:07.583 --> 02:09.959
"GWA."

02:10.041 --> 02:11.709
Global World Airlines.

02:11.792 --> 02:14.250
Hasn't been around
since the early '60s.

02:14.333 --> 02:15.709
Got ourselves a pilot?

02:15.792 --> 02:18.458
Pilots were only male back
then.
More likely a stewardess.

02:18.542 --> 02:20.458
It was a layover at the hotel

02:20.542 --> 02:22.625
maybe some kind of tryst?

02:23.542 --> 02:26.166
And someone clipped her wings.

03:01.333 --> 03:04.250
Ally Thurston,
21-year-old stewardess.

03:04.333 --> 03:06.583
Think they're called
flight attendants, John.

03:06.667 --> 03:08.041
Not in 1960, they weren't.

03:08.125 --> 03:10.250
When servers
were
waitresses.

03:10.333 --> 03:12.458
The good old days.

03:12.542 --> 03:15.917
Ally was reported
missing
November 18, 1960

03:16.000 --> 03:17.709
by roommate Helen McCormick

03:17.792 --> 03:19.417
another stewardess
based in Philly.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.917
They saw each other
in the crew lounge at 11 a.m.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.750
Ally had flown in from Dallas

03:23.834 --> 03:25.792
'was signing out
after another flight.'

03:25.875 --> 03:27.709
Well, they were supposed
to go out together that
night.

03:27.792 --> 03:29.750
And Helen got home,
Ally never showed.

03:29.834 --> 03:30.917
'She called the police
the next morning.'

03:31.000 --> 03:32.250
Assigned searched her room

03:32.333 --> 03:35.333
found an itinerary
for a flight to Spain.

03:35.417 --> 03:37.625
Philly to Madrid,
American Flight 289.

03:37.709 --> 03:39.583
November 18 at 12:30 p.m.

03:39.667 --> 03:41.709
Decided she was
off jet-setting.

03:41.792 --> 03:43.166
Search ended then and there.

03:43.250 --> 03:45.125
Global World flew international.

03:45.208 --> 03:46.542
Why buy a ticket
on another airline

03:46.625 --> 03:47.959
when you can fly
your own for free?

03:48.041 --> 03:49.834
Someone else
buys her the ticket?

03:49.917 --> 03:51.500
- Any guys in the picture?
- None in here.

03:51.583 --> 03:54.583
But the swinging '60s, stews
would've had plenty of
suitors.

03:54.667 --> 03:55.959
Family?

03:56.041 --> 04:00.625
Parents, Lew and Debra Thurston
in Glassboro, New Jersey.

04:01.375 --> 04:02.834
Gotta cross the bridge.

04:02.917 --> 04:04.208
I'll take the drive.

04:04.291 --> 04:05.625
Get a DNA swab from the family

04:05.709 --> 04:07.333
to ID her remains.

04:11.166 --> 04:12.667
Guy converting the condos

04:12.750 --> 04:16.417
is using the old hotel guest
books to decorate the lobby.

04:16.500 --> 04:19.083
Said I'd give them back
when we were done.

04:19.166 --> 04:22.750
Got everything from '52 till
the place went belly-up in
'73.

04:22.834 --> 04:25.000
Man, travel ain't
what it used to be.

04:25.083 --> 04:26.417
How would you know?

04:26.500 --> 04:28.000
Ain't left Philly
since I known you.

04:28.083 --> 04:31.000
Six weeks' vacation
time built up, will.

04:31.083 --> 04:33.667
Use it or lose it.

04:33.750 --> 04:36.125
As a matter of fact,
considering a little trip

04:36.208 --> 04:38.000
to the Balkan Riviera.

04:38.083 --> 04:39.959
Is that a planet
from "Star Trek?"

04:40.041 --> 04:41.041
Croatia.

04:41.125 --> 04:42.834
Croatia.
With the wars?

04:42.917 --> 04:44.625
It's a hot destination
these days.

04:44.709 --> 04:47.000
Top ten beaches in the world.

04:47.083 --> 04:49.333
Keep up, son.

04:55.083 --> 04:58.041
Let you know in a
couple
days, Mr. Thurston.

04:58.125 --> 05:02.000
Guess you're used
to this, people dying.

05:02.083 --> 05:05.208
Anything you can tell me about
the last time you saw Ally?

05:05.291 --> 05:07.500
We were a lot alike,
my daughter and me.

05:07.583 --> 05:08.709
Both passionate.

05:08.792 --> 05:10.625
Both stubborn as an ox.

05:10.709 --> 05:11.959
Trouble getting along?

05:12.041 --> 05:14.417
Wondered if she
joined the airline

05:14.500 --> 05:15.834
just to get away from me.

05:15.917 --> 05:17.875
No, I'm sure there
were other reasons.

05:17.959 --> 05:21.458
Once she put her mind
to something, look out.

05:23.125 --> 05:25.333
She was, she was always
my little girl.

05:25.417 --> 05:26.875
'Just..'

05:26.959 --> 05:31.041
...different with fathers
and daughters, you know?

05:33.000 --> 05:35.083
You-you talk to her
after she left?

05:35.166 --> 05:37.000
She said she'd call, but..

05:37.083 --> 05:38.875
Any boyfriends you knew about?

05:38.959 --> 05:40.959
Just Bert,
from high school.

05:41.041 --> 05:43.291
Bert Walters.

05:43.375 --> 05:44.583
Not a fan?

05:44.667 --> 05:48.166
Kid couldn't let her
out of his sight.

05:48.250 --> 05:49.792
She was too good for him

05:49.875 --> 05:52.709
'and he knew it.'

05:52.792 --> 05:54.917
Thanks for your time.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.542
I may not look like
the adventurous type

05:58.625 --> 06:03.750
but Ally got her
travel bug from me.

06:03.834 --> 06:04.917
How's that?

06:05.000 --> 06:06.917
Served in the
infantry
in World War II.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.583
Helped liberate Paris.

06:08.667 --> 06:11.417
'Brought back an Eiffel Tower
trinket for her.'

06:11.500 --> 06:15.667
Told her we'd collect one for
every monument in the world.

06:19.583 --> 06:21.542
Never happened.

06:53.500 --> 06:56.458
Yeah?

06:56.542 --> 06:58.667
Who the hell is this?

06:59.667 --> 07:00.792
What?

07:00.875 --> 07:04.667
Some joker called me
a punk ass bitch.

07:04.750 --> 07:06.000
How'd he know?

07:08.834 --> 07:11.333
(Miller)
'Dr. McCormick?'

07:11.417 --> 07:13.667
Yes. Sorry I'm late.

07:13.750 --> 07:15.333
My patient
delivered twins.

07:15.417 --> 07:17.083
A long way from stewardessing.

07:17.166 --> 07:19.667
Well, I never intended
that to be a career.

07:19.750 --> 07:21.709
You said there was a case
I could help you with?

07:21.792 --> 07:24.834
Yeah. We want to talk
to you about Ally Thurston.

07:24.917 --> 07:26.250
You were her roommate.

07:26.333 --> 07:27.959
Ally?

07:28.583 --> 07:29.667
You found her?

07:29.750 --> 07:31.500
The two of you were close?

07:34.834 --> 07:37.959
From the moment we started
stewardess training.

07:38.041 --> 07:40.083
Was she in Spain like they said?

07:40.166 --> 07:41.291
Philly.

07:41.375 --> 07:43.917
Two of you ever go
to the Republican
Hotel?

07:44.000 --> 07:46.375
Lobby bar, maybe?

07:46.458 --> 07:48.792
We never went there, no.

07:48.875 --> 07:50.792
'I told the police
she didn't run off.'

07:50.875 --> 07:53.792
They'd already made up
their minds about her.

07:53.875 --> 07:57.750
All those ads making
stewardesses out to be sexpots.

07:57.834 --> 08:02.792
Last time you saw her,
November 18, 11 a.m.

08:02.875 --> 08:04.375
She upset about anything?

08:04.458 --> 08:07.375
Ally wasn't the type
to get upset.

08:07.458 --> 08:10.834
If something was bothering
her,
she'd fix it...move on.

08:10.917 --> 08:12.375
Small-town moxie.

08:12.458 --> 08:14.917
Any idea who might've
invited her to Spain?

08:15.000 --> 08:16.125
A boyfriend?

08:16.208 --> 08:18.583
Yes. I told them
from the beginning.

08:18.667 --> 08:20.041
It wasn't the guys
she was meeting

08:20.125 --> 08:21.625
in the air who
were the problem.

08:23.792 --> 08:25.417
Hi. Are you
Helen McCormick?

08:25.500 --> 08:28.542
Oh, you must be Ally
Thurston,
my new roommate.

08:28.625 --> 08:29.792
Hope you don't mind snoring.

08:31.834 --> 08:33.250
So, where are you from?

08:33.333 --> 08:36.625
Recruited straight from
the University of
Colorado.

08:36.709 --> 08:39.417
- How about you?
- Glassboro, New Jersey.

08:39.500 --> 08:41.291
Population, boring.

08:41.375 --> 08:42.750
Small-town girl, huh?

08:42.834 --> 08:46.291
It was either nurse,
schoolteacher or librarian

08:46.375 --> 08:48.792
till I saw the GWA
recruitment ad in the paper.

08:48.875 --> 08:50.792
Good morning, ladies!
Good morning!

08:50.875 --> 08:52.208
I'm Gloria Flagstone.

08:52.291 --> 08:54.792
And you, my dears,
are the elite of the elite.

08:54.875 --> 08:56.917
Only three out of a
hundred girls is chosen

08:57.000 --> 08:58.709
to be a GWA stewardess.

08:58.792 --> 09:01.959
You had a better chance of
getting into Harvard this
year.

09:02.041 --> 09:04.875
Now, it can be a glamorous
life
but you'll work hard.

09:04.959 --> 09:09.375
You'll travel the world
and maybe even meet Mr. Right.

09:09.458 --> 09:11.041
We'll start today
with your weigh-ins

09:11.125 --> 09:13.709
then you'll receive your
girdles
and your uniforms.

09:13.792 --> 09:15.291
Weigh-ins?

09:15.375 --> 09:16.542
Is she pulling our leg?

09:16.625 --> 09:18.208
I haven't
eaten
in two days.

09:18.291 --> 09:19.625
The weight they assigned
me
at my interview

09:19.709 --> 09:20.917
is not an easy target.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.291
(man)
'Ally! Ally!'

09:24.208 --> 09:27.208
Hey, hey! Hey! Ally!

09:27.291 --> 09:30.041
[banging on door]
'Ally! Ally!'

09:30.125 --> 09:31.792
Let's get out
of here, Ally-cat!

09:31.875 --> 09:34.458
Pack your stuff,
I'm taking you home! Ally!

09:34.542 --> 09:35.792
I'll be back, Ally!

09:35.875 --> 09:38.417
You'll see! You can't
get rid of me that easy!

09:45.667 --> 09:48.125
Fellow was determined
to keep her grounded.

09:48.208 --> 09:50.709
He thought they were going
to marry after high school.

09:50.792 --> 09:52.834
- He ever come back?
- Stood across the street.

09:52.917 --> 09:54.959
Staring up at the dorm room
every night.

09:55.041 --> 09:57.333
- He was obsessed with her.
- How did Ally feel about it?

09:57.417 --> 10:00.125
God knows why, but
she felt bad about it.

10:00.208 --> 10:02.417
She said that she'd tried
to let him down gently

10:02.500 --> 10:05.917
but that...
he had a mean streak.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.250
Couldn't let it go.

10:14.667 --> 10:18.333
Ally? Yeah, wow,
blast from the past.

10:18.417 --> 10:20.000
We had a thing in high school.

10:20.083 --> 10:23.625
How'd you feel about her
leaving
town to become a stewardess?

10:23.709 --> 10:25.333
Out of sight, out of mind,
know what I mean?

10:25.417 --> 10:27.875
So how do you explain stalking
her at the training school?

10:27.959 --> 10:29.375
'Breaking onto campus?'

10:29.458 --> 10:31.208
(Vera)
'Sobbing like
a little baby.'

10:31.291 --> 10:32.458
Waaah.

10:32.542 --> 10:33.875
Sounds like
you cared a lot, Bert.

10:33.959 --> 10:35.875
So I went by her school
a few times.

10:35.959 --> 10:37.125
Doesn't mean I hurt her.

10:37.208 --> 10:38.542
Saying your name
isn't going to show up

10:38.625 --> 10:41.041
when we check
her flight logs?

10:41.125 --> 10:42.417
(Rush)
'You can wait
while we check them.'

10:42.500 --> 10:44.166
- Be a few hours.
- A few days.

10:44.250 --> 10:45.709
Wait.

10:50.208 --> 10:52.333
Ally was, like,
everything to me.

10:52.417 --> 10:54.041
What'd you do to her, Bert?

10:54.125 --> 10:56.875
I saved my money,
bought a ticket.

10:58.291 --> 11:00.709
I thought she was the one,
but it was like she was

11:00.792 --> 11:02.542
slipping through my
fingers, and there was..

11:02.625 --> 11:04.709
...nothing I could do about it.

11:08.375 --> 11:11.083
(stewardess)
<i>hors d'oeuvres?</i>

11:16.834 --> 11:18.333
'Would you
like a drink?'

11:18.417 --> 11:20.834
<i>Hors d'oeuvres?</i>

11:20.917 --> 11:22.250
Cigarettes?
Cigarettes?

11:27.250 --> 11:28.750
'Martini?'

11:31.375 --> 11:33.041
I feel like I'm
running a
marathon.

11:33.125 --> 11:35.166
Well, at least you won't have
to worry about your weight.

11:35.250 --> 11:36.750
Think Gloria could
pitch in a little?

11:36.834 --> 11:39.792
"And the prince and the
princess
lived happily ever after

11:39.875 --> 11:42.208
"for this is how
such things ought to be."

11:42.291 --> 11:44.667
She says the books
calm the kids down.

11:44.750 --> 11:46.917
I think she likes the story
more than they do.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.583
- Oops!
- Ah.

11:55.166 --> 11:56.375
Got it.

11:56.458 --> 11:58.417
Thanks. That would have
caused a commotion.

11:58.500 --> 12:01.000
Well, right place,
right time, I guess.

12:02.333 --> 12:04.333
Dean London, First Officer.

12:04.417 --> 12:07.709
Ally Thurston, low
girl
on the totem pole.

12:07.792 --> 12:10.166
- Ooh. Ouch.
- Static electricity.

12:10.250 --> 12:12.083
- Airplanes.
- Airplanes.

12:12.166 --> 12:13.917
Right.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.792
Well, see you around, Ally.

12:15.875 --> 12:18.458
See you,
First Officer
London.

12:18.542 --> 12:22.458
Gonna be smooth sailing
tonight, huh, cricket?

12:22.542 --> 12:23.917
'Easy, cookie,
got to make sure'

12:24.000 --> 12:25.875
you're wearing
your regulation girdle.

12:25.959 --> 12:27.083
Which bunny's gonna bring me

12:27.166 --> 12:29.458
my coffee tonight,
one of the new recruits?

12:29.542 --> 12:31.125
I'll be taking care
of you, Captain Hughes.

12:31.208 --> 12:33.583
Coffee is the only drink
you'll be getting.

12:43.458 --> 12:45.750
Thanks, Doll. First flight?

12:45.834 --> 12:48.458
- Is it that obvious?
- Harvey Dwight.

12:48.542 --> 12:50.917
"Brilliant Import/Exports".

12:51.709 --> 12:52.834
In Madrid, Spain?

12:52.917 --> 12:54.166
Call me when you
need a vacation.

12:54.250 --> 12:55.875
I'll take you there sometime.

12:55.959 --> 12:57.667
Champagne and caviar
all the way.

13:04.250 --> 13:06.417
I couldn't take it anymore.

13:06.500 --> 13:08.917
Watching Ally get hit on
by those la-di-da's.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.667
You sure this Harvey Dwight
said
he was taking her to Madrid?

13:11.750 --> 13:12.834
I'm sure.

13:12.917 --> 13:15.083
That's how I knew
I'd lost her.

13:15.166 --> 13:17.375
I couldn't find
Madrid on a map.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.125
(Vera)
Boss, got the 411

13:22.208 --> 13:24.667
on this Harvey Dwight
and Brilliant Import/Exports.

13:24.750 --> 13:26.375
Company based in Madrid
like he said?

13:26.458 --> 13:29.500
Guy's had multiple real estate
holdings there since '58.

13:29.583 --> 13:31.709
And he's a convicted
gem smuggler.

13:31.792 --> 13:35.208
Busted in '63, served
six years at Club Fed.

13:35.291 --> 13:36.709
Gem wholesaler
out of New York today.

13:36.792 --> 13:38.333
Used stewardesses
to help him smuggle?

13:38.417 --> 13:42.333
Connie Thunder and
Lois Murphy, both with GWA.

13:42.417 --> 13:44.125
Convicted and served from '63

13:44.208 --> 13:45.542
to '65.

13:45.625 --> 13:48.166
Well, call NYPD
let's get him in here.

13:52.000 --> 13:56.125
(Miller)
Connie Thunder.
Lois Murphy.

13:56.208 --> 13:59.166
Sounds like you read
my trial transcripts.

13:59.250 --> 14:01.917
'63's a long time ago.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.417
You get Ally Thurston involved

14:04.500 --> 14:06.250
in your racket,
too, Harvey?

14:06.333 --> 14:08.375
Whoa-ho, there's
a big difference

14:08.458 --> 14:10.250
between smuggling stones

14:10.333 --> 14:12.458
and having the stones
to murder a girl.

14:12.542 --> 14:13.917
She working for you?

14:14.000 --> 14:16.917
She was just another fish
I was trying to hook.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.166
Fish?

14:18.250 --> 14:20.041
You mean, another mule.

14:20.125 --> 14:21.250
I tried to reel her

14:21.333 --> 14:25.875
in with the expense-paid
vacation, but, uh..

14:25.959 --> 14:28.458
...she could read people
even better than I could.

14:35.458 --> 14:38.542
Harvey Dwight! I know
what you're up to.

14:38.625 --> 14:41.875
And I'm not going with you to
Spain today, tomorrow or ever!

14:41.959 --> 14:44.792
But, Ally, with your
brains and my beauty--

14:44.875 --> 14:46.834
We could get into
a whole lot of
trouble.

14:46.917 --> 14:49.875
Republican Hotel,
fast as you can.

14:56.417 --> 14:58.834
Don't know why
she was going there.

14:59.959 --> 15:02.125
But it was the only time
I'd seen her upset

15:02.208 --> 15:03.875
'in the five months
I knew her.'

15:03.959 --> 15:06.500
We should believe you didn't
follow her to the hotel?

15:06.583 --> 15:10.125
Because I flew
to Madrid without her.

15:10.208 --> 15:13.667
I left Philly a half hour
after she got in the cab.

15:13.750 --> 15:17.375
This was November 18,
you saw her?

15:17.458 --> 15:19.333
12:00 noon.

15:19.417 --> 15:22.333
Looked at Republican guest books
with November 18 in mind.

15:22.417 --> 15:23.625
Room 109.

15:23.709 --> 15:26.083
Housekeeping notes next
to it the next morning.

15:26.166 --> 15:28.959
"Replace missing linens
and broken telephone."

15:29.041 --> 15:30.500
Could be our crime scene.

15:30.583 --> 15:32.834
Guy murders her in his room,
wraps her in the sheets

15:32.917 --> 15:34.125
carries her
to the basement.

15:34.208 --> 15:35.375
Broken phone.

15:35.458 --> 15:38.041
Yeah, 1960 models
weighed half a ton.

15:38.125 --> 15:39.542
Enough to bludgeon
someone to death.

15:39.625 --> 15:40.834
Who's the room registered to?

15:40.917 --> 15:43.000
T.C. Bromley,
regular at the joint.

15:43.083 --> 15:46.125
Stayed there once a month
for ten years until November
18.

15:46.208 --> 15:48.000
- Then he never comes back.
- Right.

15:48.083 --> 15:51.542
Checked the name against
GWA employee lists.

15:51.625 --> 15:53.125
No matches, no record.

15:53.208 --> 15:54.959
See if you can find
former hotel
employees.

15:55.041 --> 15:56.667
Maybe someone remembers him.

15:56.750 --> 15:58.917
If they're still alive.

16:03.291 --> 16:05.667
Croatia for a vacation, huh?

16:05.750 --> 16:07.709
It's a beautiful country.

16:07.792 --> 16:10.166
What, Beirut was booked?

16:19.291 --> 16:23.250
(Rush)
'You were Ally's
supervisor back then?'

16:23.333 --> 16:27.500
We used to carve
Chateaubriand to order.

16:27.583 --> 16:30.333
Offer martinis,
shaken or stirred.

16:30.417 --> 16:33.709
Any idea why she would've been
going to the Republican Hotel

16:33.792 --> 16:35.166
'the day she
disappeared?'

16:35.250 --> 16:37.917
No. Ally was based in Philly.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.625
She had an apartment in town.

16:39.709 --> 16:41.792
What about airline
employees
from out of town?

16:41.875 --> 16:43.583
They would've stayed
at the airport hotel

16:43.667 --> 16:45.083
they got a discount

16:45.166 --> 16:47.041
and a lively social scene.

16:47.125 --> 16:50.083
Ally into partying,
living the stewardess life?

16:50.166 --> 16:51.959
No more than any of us were.

16:52.041 --> 16:54.542
It was a glamorous life
being a stewardess.

16:54.625 --> 16:56.959
We were like...movie stars.

16:57.041 --> 17:00.917
Ever hear her mention
the name T.C. Bromley?

17:01.000 --> 17:03.417
No, I don't recognize the name.

17:03.500 --> 17:04.875
Well, what about boyfriends?

17:04.959 --> 17:06.417
Well, if you're
looking for a man

17:06.500 --> 17:09.000
who wanted to get Ally
into a hotel room

17:09.083 --> 17:11.834
look no further
than Dean London.

17:27.041 --> 17:28.458
Ready for your drink,
Miss Rogers?

17:28.542 --> 17:30.250
Thought you'd never
ask, Mr. Astaire.

17:32.583 --> 17:35.500
Whoa. What do you got,
a .38 special in here?

17:35.583 --> 17:38.166
No. It's the
Empire
State Building.

17:38.250 --> 17:40.542
Picked it up in New York
this
morning for my collection.

17:40.625 --> 17:43.458
Collection of souvenirs,
cute, kiddo.

17:43.542 --> 17:45.125
It's more than that.

17:45.208 --> 17:47.375
My father got me the Eiffel
Tower when I was five.

17:47.458 --> 17:48.792
I'm gonna get every one.

17:48.875 --> 17:50.959
Well, you've got the
right job to do it.

17:51.041 --> 17:53.959
And if I make captain, I might
be the man to take you there.

17:54.041 --> 17:55.667
If you don't make captain

17:55.750 --> 17:57.792
the earth will stop spinning.

17:57.875 --> 17:59.250
That's the only thing
you think about.

17:59.333 --> 18:01.625
Not the only thing.

18:06.333 --> 18:09.125
Peggy was my favorite
instructor
at the charm farm.

18:09.208 --> 18:10.500
Today's her birthday?

18:10.583 --> 18:11.834
Her going away.

18:11.917 --> 18:13.333
She hit the age ceiling.

18:13.417 --> 18:15.208
Peggy's 32?

18:15.291 --> 18:16.500
But she's still a knockout.

18:16.583 --> 18:19.583
Knockout or not,
airline's canning her.

18:19.667 --> 18:21.000
Doesn't seem very fair.

18:21.083 --> 18:23.375
Don't you worry
your pretty little head.

18:23.458 --> 18:27.208
Most girls find husbands
and leave before then anyway.

18:27.291 --> 18:29.709
[chuckles]
How about you, old gal,
you gonna age out soon?

18:29.792 --> 18:31.667
I'm 26 years
old,
Captain Hughes.

18:31.750 --> 18:33.417
Why, do I look like
an old bag to you?

18:33.500 --> 18:35.375
You're anything but, Gloria.

18:42.792 --> 18:45.208
Back then, pilots thought
that stewardesses were there

18:45.291 --> 18:46.542
just to make them happy.

18:46.625 --> 18:48.834
This Captain Hughes
sounds pretty
frisky.

18:48.917 --> 18:51.166
Yeah, he was a flirt, alright.

18:51.250 --> 18:52.542
But he was married.

18:52.625 --> 18:54.500
Dean had his
sights
set on Ally?

18:54.583 --> 18:58.083
Like he was bringing
a bird in for landing.

19:00.291 --> 19:04.917
Ally was a great gal.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.500
We dated a month, maybe two.

19:06.583 --> 19:08.792
We'd split up by the time
she disappeared.

19:08.875 --> 19:10.375
When was that?

19:10.458 --> 19:12.959
October, November.
I don't remember.

19:13.041 --> 19:17.542
You stay at the Republican Hotel
during your layovers in Philly?

19:17.625 --> 19:18.625
No. Why?

19:18.709 --> 19:20.208
(Vera)
Do you remember
where you were

19:20.291 --> 19:22.417
the night Ally disappeared?

19:22.500 --> 19:24.375
Yeah, uh, Miami.

19:24.458 --> 19:27.125
Breakers Hotel.
You can check it.

19:27.208 --> 19:29.250
Cops never questioned
you when she went missing?

19:29.333 --> 19:30.792
There was no reason to.

19:30.875 --> 19:33.667
Said she flew off into
the sunset with some Don Juan.

19:33.750 --> 19:35.500
So, why'd you two
break up anyway?

19:35.583 --> 19:37.458
Different flights,
different cities.

19:37.542 --> 19:41.041
I don't know where you're
going
with this, but it was 1960.

19:41.125 --> 19:44.333
I was single, flying 707's
in a fancy uniform.

19:44.417 --> 19:46.208
You saying Ally
was just a fling?

19:46.291 --> 19:48.166
I'm saying she had spunk.

19:48.250 --> 19:50.333
And I admired that spunk.

19:50.417 --> 19:52.625
Not all men found it charming.

19:58.208 --> 19:59.583
Your coffee,
Captain Hughes.

19:59.667 --> 20:01.166
Oh, thanks, cricket.

20:01.250 --> 20:05.208
Hey, listen, we got
ourselves
a little emergency up
here.

20:05.291 --> 20:08.583
Oxygen tank went haywire,
isn't
pumping O2 into the cabin.

20:08.667 --> 20:12.166
Unless we want 200 people
taking a snooze back there

20:12.250 --> 20:15.458
I'm gonna need your help
going to manual
procedure.

20:15.542 --> 20:17.458
Absolutely, captain.

20:17.542 --> 20:19.041
You see that
button right
there?

20:19.125 --> 20:20.709
I need you to push
it
every half hour

20:20.792 --> 20:23.458
hold it down
for 15
seconds.

20:23.542 --> 20:26.625
Go ahead,
give it a
try.

20:42.917 --> 20:46.083
You-you can let go now, Ally.

20:46.166 --> 20:50.375
Come back in half an hour.
We'll do it again.

20:50.458 --> 20:55.125
Oh, hey, uh, Irish up my
coffee for me, will you,
kid?

20:55.208 --> 20:56.583
Yes, sir.

20:56.667 --> 21:00.667
I'll need to go to manual
procedure again, captain.

21:05.583 --> 21:07.125
Get off of me!

21:07.208 --> 21:08.917
Oh, you're a real
tiger,
aren't you?

21:09.000 --> 21:11.125
Come on, Rowland, you had
a few. Leave her alone.

21:11.208 --> 21:13.875
I'll decide when
I've had enough.

21:24.458 --> 21:26.208
I should've knocked
him on his ass.

21:26.291 --> 21:27.542
But he was your boss.

21:27.625 --> 21:29.709
'I needed the bastard's
recommendation.'

21:29.792 --> 21:31.250
She was the first girl
to turn him down.

21:31.333 --> 21:32.583
At least that's
what he told me.

21:32.667 --> 21:34.000
They have any
trouble after
that?

21:34.083 --> 21:35.917
I don't know,
but the same week

21:36.000 --> 21:39.250
Ally disappeared, Rowland
left GWA for South Ocean Air.

21:39.333 --> 21:40.458
Struck you as odd?

21:40.542 --> 21:42.041
Well, back then
most pilots stayed

21:42.125 --> 21:45.208
with the same airlines
their whole lives.

21:45.291 --> 21:47.250
He puts in 15 years
and then leaves

21:47.333 --> 21:49.291
six months before
his pension is vested?

22:05.333 --> 22:07.500
Your move, Cooper.

22:11.333 --> 22:13.458
Chess always was
your favorite
game.

22:24.125 --> 22:26.041
Lilly.

22:28.083 --> 22:29.709
Hi, dad.

22:33.875 --> 22:37.208
So here you are.

22:37.291 --> 22:39.750
All grown up.

22:39.834 --> 22:41.083
Right.

22:42.667 --> 22:45.291
Don't know where to start.

22:45.375 --> 22:48.417
You married?

22:48.500 --> 22:51.083
No.

22:51.166 --> 22:54.583
Work for the city?

22:54.667 --> 22:57.250
Cop.

22:57.333 --> 22:58.959
I'm a homicide detective.

22:59.041 --> 23:01.291
Homicide.

23:01.375 --> 23:03.959
Was that you
outside my house?

23:08.041 --> 23:09.750
Yes.

23:09.834 --> 23:12.959
So...you know about..

23:16.083 --> 23:17.959
Your family?

23:19.542 --> 23:21.500
It's been a long time.

23:23.917 --> 23:28.291
Tell you the truth, I never
thought I'd see you again.

23:30.959 --> 23:34.917
Sent you a bunch
of letters a while
back.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.959
Yeah, I got them.

23:38.875 --> 23:41.041
I still have them.

23:41.125 --> 23:45.000
Thought maybe your mother had
decided not to give them to
you.

23:45.083 --> 23:48.166
I...I got 'em.

23:48.250 --> 23:51.750
I never heard back from you.

23:51.834 --> 23:53.709
I was 15.

23:54.375 --> 23:56.000
Not a baby.

23:58.625 --> 24:01.166
You could have tried again.

24:01.250 --> 24:03.875
You blame me for that?

24:03.959 --> 24:08.000
That the reason you drop out
of thin air like this?

24:08.083 --> 24:10.125
To point fingers?

24:14.625 --> 24:16.500
'Look..'

24:18.250 --> 24:22.375
I am so glad you're here.

24:22.458 --> 24:25.041
'Okay?'

24:25.125 --> 24:27.709
Okay.

24:31.375 --> 24:33.583
How's you're mother doing?

24:36.166 --> 24:38.750
Yeah, she's fine.

24:40.458 --> 24:42.542
I got to go.

24:45.792 --> 24:47.834
Lilly?

24:50.125 --> 24:53.041
I'm here every week, you know.

25:04.792 --> 25:07.750
Rowland Hughes,
Detective Valens.

25:07.834 --> 25:11.000
Airline pilot in the '60s, huh?

25:11.083 --> 25:12.625
Hand in my badge any day

25:12.709 --> 25:13.917
to have wings back then.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.417
Women you must of had

25:15.500 --> 25:17.375
just dropping at your feet.

25:17.458 --> 25:19.917
Times we won't see repeated.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.125
Detective Valens.

25:22.208 --> 25:24.750
Coffee?

25:24.834 --> 25:27.208
Thanks, sweetheart.

25:30.333 --> 25:32.291
Anyway, couple things I got

25:32.375 --> 25:34.291
to clear up here.

25:34.375 --> 25:38.250
Ally Thurston, stew
I called you about.

25:38.333 --> 25:39.583
Two of you get along okay?

25:39.667 --> 25:41.166
Sure, we got along great.

25:41.250 --> 25:44.792
There's something here about
her pouring whiskey on you

25:44.875 --> 25:46.542
while you're flying a 707?

25:46.625 --> 25:47.834
Where'd you hear that?

25:47.917 --> 25:49.667
Just give me something
for the boss.

25:49.750 --> 25:52.125
I mean, you were the pilot.

25:52.208 --> 25:54.625
Who'd she think
she was, right?

25:54.709 --> 25:56.917
She was wound tight,
that's for sure.

25:57.000 --> 26:01.583
Is that why you left GWA
for, uh, South Ocean Air?

26:01.667 --> 26:02.959
''Cause she turned you down?'

26:03.041 --> 26:05.542
You think I cared about
some uppity stew?

26:05.625 --> 26:06.625
'Come on.'

26:06.709 --> 26:07.792
So why'd you leave?

26:07.875 --> 26:09.458
'Well, let's just
say I'd already'

26:09.542 --> 26:12.834
worked my way through the
"girls next door" at GWA.

26:12.917 --> 26:14.625
'South Ocean hired
the sexpots.'

26:14.709 --> 26:17.125
It was time
for greener pastures.

26:17.208 --> 26:18.583
Right.

26:18.667 --> 26:21.709
You ever take any back
to the Republican Hotel?

26:21.792 --> 26:23.291
'The Republican?'

26:23.375 --> 26:26.250
No, not that I remember.

26:26.333 --> 26:28.709
Look, Rowland.

26:30.375 --> 26:31.834
I'm trying to help you.

26:31.917 --> 26:33.333
'Your name's in here.'

26:33.417 --> 26:34.834
Twice.

26:34.917 --> 26:38.834
You got a room three
months
before she disappeared

26:38.917 --> 26:40.375
and another
a year before
that.

26:40.458 --> 26:43.333
Yeah. The Republican,
now I remember.

26:43.417 --> 26:46.667
Stayed there when I didn't
want
everyone at the airport hotel

26:46.750 --> 26:48.166
knowing my business.

26:48.250 --> 26:49.667
I was a married man.

26:49.750 --> 26:53.083
You leave GWA the same
week she disappears.

26:53.166 --> 26:54.333
You lie about staying

26:54.417 --> 26:55.834
at the place we found her.

26:55.917 --> 26:57.834
My first flight for South Ocean

26:57.917 --> 27:02.000
was a overnighter
to Fiji, November 17.

27:02.083 --> 27:04.125
I was out of the country
the whole month.

27:04.208 --> 27:05.667
That all you got?

27:05.750 --> 27:08.583
If you really want to know
who that girl had trouble
with

27:08.667 --> 27:09.917
talk to the women in her life.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.208
Why's that?

27:11.291 --> 27:13.333
You put a bunch of 'em
in an aluminum tube

27:13.417 --> 27:16.333
hormones raging,
the claws come out.

27:25.333 --> 27:30.125
Swedish Royal Palace.
Wait till Dean sees this
one.

27:30.208 --> 27:32.458
I'm sorry. I've got to get
back to our room.

27:32.542 --> 27:33.709
But we just set out.

27:33.792 --> 27:34.959
I'm feeling under the weather.

27:35.041 --> 27:37.875
Why don't you go
sight-seeing without me?

27:37.959 --> 27:40.917
You've been so tired.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.625
Helen, are you..

27:44.792 --> 27:46.250
That's great news.

27:46.333 --> 27:48.458
The medical student from
your flight to Detroit?

27:48.542 --> 27:50.000
(Helen)
'James.'

27:50.083 --> 27:51.792
(Ally)
'Well, you're in love
with him, right?'

27:51.875 --> 27:53.166
Are you going to get married?

27:53.250 --> 27:54.625
He can't support me yet.

27:54.709 --> 27:57.000
And if the airline finds
out that I'm pregnant..

27:57.083 --> 27:59.583
So that's why you bid
this flight to Sweden.

27:59.667 --> 28:01.750
- To take care of it?
- Don't be so dramatic, Ally.

28:01.834 --> 28:03.250
People do it all the time.

28:03.333 --> 28:05.500
You should be able to
keep
your job and your kid

28:05.583 --> 28:06.750
if that's what you want.

28:06.834 --> 28:08.083
Well, I don't have
that choice, do I?

28:11.792 --> 28:14.458
What Rowland did to me,
to all the girls

28:14.542 --> 28:16.125
the airline canning Peggy

28:16.208 --> 28:19.375
the corner they've backed
you into...it's not fair.

28:19.458 --> 28:23.083
You going to take on
Global World Airlines, Ally?

28:23.166 --> 28:25.458
Well, some of the
stews
have been talking.

28:25.542 --> 28:26.959
We're going to
start
our own union.

28:27.041 --> 28:28.917
We're gonna get out from
under the pilots' thumbs.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.458
When they find
out
about this--

28:30.542 --> 28:34.125
Are you crazy? I am not
telling anyone about this.

28:34.208 --> 28:36.417
And neither are you.
Got it?

28:41.709 --> 28:45.125
The airline had a
policy
against pregnancy?

28:45.208 --> 28:46.542
Pregnancy, marriage

28:46.625 --> 28:47.750
being fat.

28:47.834 --> 28:49.291
Fares were regulated.

28:49.375 --> 28:52.500
The only way they could compete
was with the stews they had.

28:52.583 --> 28:55.250
"Girls Next Door" at GWA

28:55.333 --> 28:57.583
"Girls Gone
Wild"
at South Ocean.

28:57.667 --> 28:59.959
One thing they had in common?

29:00.041 --> 29:01.959
Being available.

29:03.417 --> 29:06.458
The good old ' days.

29:06.542 --> 29:09.625
So what's this about
the stews looking to
unionize?

29:09.709 --> 29:12.500
We'd already let 'em into the
Airline Pilots Association.

29:12.583 --> 29:14.417
We were taking care of them.

29:14.500 --> 29:17.333
Suddenly we didn't have their
best interests in mind.

29:17.417 --> 29:18.750
You ask me,
they're nothing

29:18.834 --> 29:21.125
but waitresses in the sky.

29:29.250 --> 29:31.250
Looked for Republican
Hotel employees

29:31.333 --> 29:33.166
the maid that cleaned
the room the next day.

29:33.250 --> 29:34.709
All dead.

29:34.792 --> 29:37.500
Found another
T.C. Bromley off
Google.

29:37.583 --> 29:41.166
One-hit wonder
author from
1882.

29:41.250 --> 29:43.166
That makes our doer, what, 130?

29:50.583 --> 29:53.375
Photos from the
Baker-Feldman case.

29:54.500 --> 29:56.834
You came all the
way
upstairs for that?

29:58.125 --> 30:00.875
My legs were falling
asleep at my desk.

30:00.959 --> 30:03.375
It's a lucky desk.

30:05.458 --> 30:07.000
You got plans this weekend?

30:07.083 --> 30:08.458
Not anymore.

30:08.542 --> 30:12.375
Pick me up tomorrow night at
8:00. Midvale Hotel.

30:12.458 --> 30:14.458
Landlord's fumigating
my apartment.

30:14.542 --> 30:16.000
The room's on him.

30:16.083 --> 30:19.375
He going to be there, too?

30:19.458 --> 30:21.458
Don't be late.

30:31.583 --> 30:34.375
What ever happened with you
and your fiancé, Helen?

30:34.458 --> 30:35.834
My fiancé?

30:35.917 --> 30:38.834
The medical student
from Detroit you were dating?

30:38.917 --> 30:42.083
James...we were never engaged.

30:42.166 --> 30:43.542
(Miller)
'Why'd it end?'

30:43.625 --> 30:46.083
Ally tell him about
your trip to Stockholm?

30:46.166 --> 30:50.875
No. It ended when I told him I
couldn't have children anymore.

30:51.959 --> 30:53.417
Reason I became a doctor.

30:53.500 --> 30:58.667
So what happened to me
wouldn't happen to other women.

30:58.750 --> 31:00.542
Ally nursed me through
the botched procedure.

31:00.625 --> 31:03.792
- She never told a soul.
- I'm sorry.

31:03.875 --> 31:06.917
I would've died without her.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.625
- Instead--
- what happened, Helen?

31:09.709 --> 31:12.333
When she saw what
happened to me

31:12.417 --> 31:15.750
she said she couldn't
sit back and watch anymore.

31:15.834 --> 31:17.291
Ally had guts.

31:17.375 --> 31:21.083
But people with
guts
make enemies.

31:25.625 --> 31:28.500
How are you feeling?
Are you okay?

31:30.667 --> 31:31.834
Thank you..

31:31.917 --> 31:34.542
...for being my friend.

31:34.625 --> 31:37.667
I'm going to take care
of you, do you hear me?

31:37.750 --> 31:41.417
This is your first flight back,
and I want you to take it easy.

31:41.500 --> 31:44.333
I'll get the service started.

31:47.000 --> 31:48.667
Hey, I need you to make sure

31:48.750 --> 31:49.959
tonight's flight
is extra smooth.

31:50.041 --> 31:51.458
Helen isn't feeling very well.

31:51.542 --> 31:52.917
What the hell's
wrong
with you, Ally?

31:53.000 --> 31:54.417
What do you mean?

31:54.500 --> 31:57.834
You didn't really go to
airline personnel, did
you?

31:57.917 --> 32:00.000
Yes. I had a few things
to discuss with them.

32:00.083 --> 32:01.667
Don't you understand
how that looks for
me?

32:01.750 --> 32:03.333
I'm up for my promotion.

32:03.417 --> 32:04.667
What does your
promotion have to do

32:04.750 --> 32:05.959
with unfair work
conditions?

32:06.041 --> 32:07.667
They're saying
if
I can't control
you

32:07.750 --> 32:10.166
how can I control a
707
with 200 passengers?

32:10.250 --> 32:13.333
This has nothing to do
with your career, Dean.

32:13.417 --> 32:16.000
People are getting hurt.

32:16.083 --> 32:18.458
Besides, they told me
to take a hike.

32:18.542 --> 32:20.834
They don't care what
we have to say anyway.

32:20.917 --> 32:24.208
Good. So this is over?

32:25.834 --> 32:27.083
No.

32:27.875 --> 32:30.417
It's just starting.

32:35.500 --> 32:38.041
"No fair play at GWA?"

32:38.125 --> 32:40.709
If you walk out
there
wearing that thing

32:40.792 --> 32:42.750
then this is war.

32:42.834 --> 32:44.875
Then war it is.

32:55.667 --> 32:59.000
That was two weeks
before she disappeared.

32:59.083 --> 33:01.041
I always wondered
if he'd gone after her.

33:01.125 --> 33:03.667
Saying Ally was
some kind of feminist?

33:03.750 --> 33:07.041
Feminists didn't
even exist in
1960.

33:07.125 --> 33:09.625
No, she just
believed
in fair play.

33:09.709 --> 33:12.375
What happened to Dean's career
after she disappeared?

33:12.458 --> 33:15.333
A week later, the airline
made the announcement.

33:16.125 --> 33:18.166
He got his promotion.

33:18.250 --> 33:19.417
(Miller)
'Yeah.'

33:19.500 --> 33:21.375
And Ally got dead.

33:24.333 --> 33:25.750
What is this? I told you
I was in Miami that week.

33:25.834 --> 33:27.542
Yeah, we heard
that story before.

33:27.625 --> 33:29.291
Along with that song
and dance you threw us

33:29.375 --> 33:31.000
about some other
bad pilot.

33:31.083 --> 33:33.583
Acting like you were some
patron saint of stewardesses.

33:33.667 --> 33:36.375
- I didn't say that.
- 'No, you said "This is
war."'

33:36.458 --> 33:38.208
Right, Dean? To Ally.

33:38.291 --> 33:40.834
Woman threatened
your precious promotion.

33:40.917 --> 33:43.542
I was mad. People say
stupid
things when they're mad.

33:43.625 --> 33:45.875
Do stupid things, too.
Especially in hotels.

33:45.959 --> 33:47.625
(Jeffries)
'Take things too far.'

33:47.709 --> 33:49.291
Ally was a thorn in your side.

33:49.375 --> 33:51.041
'Causing you a lot of problems.'

33:51.125 --> 33:53.875
You're right.

33:53.959 --> 33:55.500
Problem was, I loved her.

34:09.125 --> 34:11.166
Two lumps. How you
like it, right?

34:14.375 --> 34:15.917
I have good news.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.291
You grew a conscience?

34:17.375 --> 34:18.875
They're promoting me to captain.

34:18.959 --> 34:21.083
Be official in two weeks.

34:21.166 --> 34:22.667
Congratulations.

34:22.750 --> 34:24.417
You got everything you wanted.

34:25.208 --> 34:27.125
Not everything.

34:29.417 --> 34:31.458
"Kingdom Afar?"

34:31.542 --> 34:33.125
You want me
to read this to you?

34:33.208 --> 34:35.625
Just skip to the part where
the prince and the princess

34:35.709 --> 34:38.750
live happily ever after.

34:42.291 --> 34:44.083
Dean.

34:49.709 --> 34:51.333
So..

34:51.417 --> 34:53.709
...will you?

34:56.834 --> 34:58.917
No.

35:05.959 --> 35:07.709
Um..

35:09.208 --> 35:11.041
- I thought that--
- You know that I do.

35:11.125 --> 35:12.792
Then say yes.

35:12.875 --> 35:15.041
You're so worked up
over all this union
stuff

35:15.125 --> 35:17.166
the way stews
are treated.

35:17.250 --> 35:19.667
I'm offering you a way out.

35:21.583 --> 35:24.792
Pilots are allowed to be
married and have families.

35:24.875 --> 35:27.083
Pilots are allowed
to be older than 32.

35:27.166 --> 35:29.667
Pilots can even
flick girls' girdles

35:29.750 --> 35:32.709
and still keep their jobs.

35:32.792 --> 35:36.542
I'll marry you when
the same is true for stews.

35:39.625 --> 35:43.125
All these years I thought it
was
an excuse not to marry me.

35:43.208 --> 35:45.125
That she'd run off
with someone else.

35:45.208 --> 35:46.709
You ever see her
again after that?

35:46.792 --> 35:49.083
No. I flew to
Miami
the next morning.

35:49.166 --> 35:50.542
Spent a week holed
up in my room

35:50.625 --> 35:53.000
with three
months'
salary worth of
gin.

35:53.959 --> 35:56.792
When I got back, she was gone.

35:56.875 --> 36:00.667
Still buy those monuments
she collected wherever I
go.

36:00.750 --> 36:04.208
The book you taped the ring
inside "Kingdom Afar."

36:04.291 --> 36:05.667
It's a fairy tale stews
used to read to kids

36:05.750 --> 36:06.917
when they were cranky.

36:07.000 --> 36:08.125
(Dean)
'Why?'

36:08.208 --> 36:10.875
Written by my new
favorite author.

36:12.458 --> 36:14.583
Tracked down the head
of personnel at GWA.

36:14.667 --> 36:16.291
Ally rallied every
girl Rowland Hughes

36:16.375 --> 36:17.917
ever laid his hands on.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.250
Threatened to go public
unless
the airline got rid of him.

36:20.333 --> 36:22.458
Airline buckled day
before Ally disappeared.

36:22.542 --> 36:24.417
November 17, 1960.

36:24.500 --> 36:27.000
Rowland left GWA because
Ally got him fired?

36:27.083 --> 36:29.583
That type of thing
was unheard of back
then.

36:29.667 --> 36:31.792
But Ally knew how much
the press liked stews.

36:31.875 --> 36:33.500
Gives Rowland motive to spare.

36:33.583 --> 36:35.458
Problem is, his
alibi checks out.

36:35.542 --> 36:38.417
He was out of the country
November 17th till the 30th.

36:38.500 --> 36:39.917
There someone else who
had a vested interest

36:40.000 --> 36:41.125
in Rowland's career?

36:41.208 --> 36:44.417
Yup. And I know who it was.

36:44.500 --> 36:46.125
"Kingdom Afar."

36:46.208 --> 36:47.542
By T.C. Bromley.

36:47.625 --> 36:49.750
Our regular at
the Republican Hotel.

36:51.250 --> 36:55.458
"The prince and the princess
lived happily ever after

36:55.542 --> 36:58.417
"for this is how
such things ought to be."

37:01.083 --> 37:02.625
"Kingdom Afar."

37:02.709 --> 37:04.417
You familiar
with it,
Gloria?

37:04.500 --> 37:06.834
What does a children's book
have to do with anything?

37:06.917 --> 37:09.959
T.C. Bromley, the author?

37:10.041 --> 37:14.291
Same name as someone who
stayed at the Republican Hotel

37:14.375 --> 37:16.667
once a month for ten years.

37:16.750 --> 37:20.250
Distinctive T's and B's.

37:20.333 --> 37:21.709
I don't know what
you're talking
about.

37:21.792 --> 37:23.083
I've never stayed
at the Republican.

37:23.166 --> 37:25.709
C'mon, Gloria.
Got your old files.

37:25.792 --> 37:29.583
Compared your handwriting
with T.C. Bromley's.

37:29.667 --> 37:32.417
(Valens)
'It's a perfect match.'

37:32.500 --> 37:34.208
There has to be some mistake.

37:34.291 --> 37:37.625
Who were you meeting at the
hotel all those years,
Gloria?

37:37.709 --> 37:39.750
(Valens)
'There's no ring
on your finger.'

37:39.834 --> 37:43.000
Whoever it was never
made you an honest woman.

37:43.083 --> 37:45.625
A lady never tells.

37:45.709 --> 37:48.834
"Lady?" You mean
"the other woman?"

37:48.917 --> 37:52.917
You used an alias 'cause
Rowland Hughes was married.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.291
Rowland Hughes?
The pilot?

37:55.375 --> 37:57.166
His name's right here.

37:57.250 --> 37:58.834
Only paid for the room twice.

37:58.917 --> 38:01.208
Two times he
signed in.

38:01.291 --> 38:03.875
(Valens)
'Real prize, that guy.'

38:03.959 --> 38:06.166
You know, I-I
talked to him, Gloria.

38:06.250 --> 38:09.125
Gotta say, he must've
been a handsome man.

38:09.208 --> 38:11.792
(Valens)
'The pilot on your
first flight.'

38:11.875 --> 38:14.792
Guy like him, you
never had a chance.

38:14.875 --> 38:16.709
(Rush)
'Your first and only.'

38:16.792 --> 38:18.208
Prince and
princesses.

38:18.291 --> 38:20.291
Pilots and stews.

38:20.375 --> 38:23.750
1960, that's not a huge leap.

38:27.959 --> 38:32.041
"Through darkness and light,
the princess held out hope.."

38:38.375 --> 38:40.500
"Like all good
princesses should."

38:43.625 --> 38:46.375
You were waiting
for your prince to
come

38:46.458 --> 38:49.625
but Rowland Hughes wasn't
prince material, was he?

38:49.709 --> 38:54.375
Well, he...just
needed a little more time.

38:54.458 --> 38:56.125
To leave his wife?

38:56.208 --> 38:59.834
Married men don't
leave
their wives. Ever.

39:01.250 --> 39:03.458
I've been there, Gloria.

39:03.542 --> 39:07.250
Gave up six of the
best years of my
life.

39:07.333 --> 39:09.041
It was time you didn't have.

39:09.125 --> 39:10.500
Checked your
birth records.

39:10.583 --> 39:12.542
Weren't 26 like you said.

39:12.625 --> 39:15.583
You were almost 32,
about to hit that age
ceiling.

39:15.667 --> 39:17.417
(Rush)
'Then Rowland comes
to the hotel.'

39:17.500 --> 39:18.834
Tells you he's leaving
the airline--

39:18.917 --> 39:21.208
And bam, what little
time you had is gone.

39:21.291 --> 39:22.750
Not only were you
losing your job--

39:22.834 --> 39:24.542
You were losing
your man.

39:24.625 --> 39:27.333
Thanks to Ally
and her small-town moxie.

39:29.166 --> 39:30.959
She didn't understand.

39:32.667 --> 39:34.583
I'm..

39:34.667 --> 39:37.583
All those terrible things
she was saying about him..

39:37.667 --> 39:40.959
Once Ally put her mind
to something, look out.

39:41.041 --> 39:46.792
But she didn't know him
like I knew him.

39:46.875 --> 39:49.041
What kind of a gentleman
he could be.

39:50.917 --> 39:52.542
He took advantage
of you, Gloria.

39:52.625 --> 39:54.417
No.

39:54.500 --> 39:59.125
He loved me.

39:59.208 --> 40:02.083
I was his princess.

40:04.834 --> 40:07.500
And she was taking him away.

40:10.417 --> 40:12.625
The purser gave me your letter
when I was leaving the airport.

40:12.709 --> 40:14.959
Yes, thank you
for meeting me.

40:15.041 --> 40:17.583
"You're grounded until we talk?"

40:18.834 --> 40:21.333
Why would you ground me, Gloria?

40:21.417 --> 40:23.000
Because..

40:23.083 --> 40:24.834
...you're spreading lies.

40:24.917 --> 40:27.166
Whatever you told the
airline
to get Captain Hughes
fired

40:27.250 --> 40:29.083
I want you to take it back.

40:29.166 --> 40:31.625
But why would you care?

40:32.917 --> 40:35.041
There's the phone.

40:35.125 --> 40:39.208
If you want to fly
again,
you'll tell them the
truth.

40:39.291 --> 40:41.959
Captain Hughes is
a perfect
gentleman.

40:42.041 --> 40:45.834
Gloria...are you
involved with him?

40:45.917 --> 40:48.792
Please mind your own
business, Miss
Thurston.

40:48.875 --> 40:51.417
But you deserve better.
He's married.

40:51.500 --> 40:53.667
- And the things he's done--
- He's leaving because of you!

40:53.750 --> 40:56.375
No, he was fired,
because he's a menace.

40:56.458 --> 40:59.291
You're only doing this
so,
Dean can get his pilot
seat!

40:59.375 --> 41:01.208
I'm doing this
for the stews.

41:01.291 --> 41:02.667
So he'll stop
touching them

41:02.750 --> 41:04.709
stop following them
to their rooms like a wolf--

41:04.792 --> 41:06.834
You watch your mouth!

41:06.917 --> 41:10.000
You just can't see him for who
he is because he's using you.

41:10.083 --> 41:12.208
This is your fault!

41:12.291 --> 41:14.000
You're taking him from me!

41:14.083 --> 41:17.166
He's never going
to leave his wife, Gloria.

41:17.250 --> 41:19.458
He's only waiting
for you to age out.

41:21.834 --> 41:23.083
Take it back!

41:23.166 --> 41:24.792
Now!

41:24.875 --> 41:26.709
No, I can't do that.

41:26.792 --> 41:29.333
We've come too far.

43:59.917 --> 44:01.083
