WEBVTT

00:01.268 --> 00:03.335
(liquid pours)

00:08.943 --> 00:09.675
(clink)

00:19.186 --> 00:21.020
- [Ben] Hi, I'm Ben, this is me.

00:21.022 --> 00:24.423
I was born in Iran, and
no, we don't ride camels.

00:24.425 --> 00:26.892
This is my hometown Tehran.

00:26.894 --> 00:28.894
I moved to the US when I was 12.

00:28.896 --> 00:30.462
I basically grew up here

00:30.464 --> 00:32.998
and this was my metal phase.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.166
This is Kate.

00:34.969 --> 00:36.268
She's my wife.

00:36.270 --> 00:39.905
I met her in college and
stole her from this douche.

00:39.907 --> 00:41.774
This is my father

00:41.776 --> 00:44.343
and this was his hippie phase.

00:48.416 --> 00:51.083
(upbeat music)

00:54.889 --> 00:56.422
- [Man] Thank you.

00:58.492 --> 01:01.093
- [Ben] This is Tucker
Jefferson.

01:01.095 --> 01:02.161
He's my father-in-law.

01:02.163 --> 01:03.896
He pretty much hates me.

01:03.898 --> 01:06.465
Wow, he's looking old.

01:06.467 --> 01:08.300
The last seven years
haven't been kind to him

01:08.302 --> 01:11.036
and that kind of just makes me
smile.

01:11.038 --> 01:12.638
This is Saul Richmond.

01:12.640 --> 01:14.206
He's a lobbyist.

01:14.208 --> 01:16.442
You know, political slime.

01:16.444 --> 01:19.278
And this is President Biden.

01:19.280 --> 01:20.946
Nightmare in Chief.

01:21.782 --> 01:23.182
- Mr. President.

01:25.686 --> 01:27.653
Of course, you're busy.

01:28.989 --> 01:30.289
I'm calling to tell you that I'm
supposed

01:30.291 --> 01:32.357
to see him shortly at this
party.

01:32.359 --> 01:35.360
- Very intriguing, he's
doing great work, but um,

01:35.362 --> 01:37.029
I can't be his support.

01:37.031 --> 01:38.664
(phone beeping)
- Mister.

01:38.666 --> 01:41.233
(funky music)

01:57.384 --> 01:59.151
So you're an old show boy that
wound up

01:59.153 --> 02:00.252
out in San Diego, huh?

02:00.254 --> 02:02.288
Out on the coast?

02:02.289 --> 02:04.323
- Yeah, yeah, I couldn't make
that up.

02:11.098 --> 02:13.148
- Ah, gentlemen.

02:13.149 --> 02:15.199
Allow me to introduce you
to Mr. Tucker Jefferson,

02:15.202 --> 02:17.603
he's from the great state of
California.

02:17.605 --> 02:19.538
This is Saul Richmond.

02:19.540 --> 02:22.241
Dr. Jefferson here is a
man who could truly cause

02:22.243 --> 02:24.076
a storm in the Senate
with his years

02:24.078 --> 02:25.410
of political experience.

02:25.412 --> 02:28.647
And this guy, you know
what he can do.

02:30.184 --> 02:31.183
- Pleasure to meet you.

02:31.185 --> 02:32.184
- Likewise, sir.

02:32.186 --> 02:35.320
- Mr. Tucker Jefferson,
where do you

02:35.322 --> 02:37.456
see yourself in 10 years?

02:38.692 --> 02:40.125
- In the oval office.

02:40.127 --> 02:42.961
(laughing)

02:42.963 --> 02:44.129
- Doing what, serving coffee?

02:44.131 --> 02:46.165
- No, no, being served.

02:46.167 --> 02:49.434
And my inauguration speech is
already written. (chuckling)

02:49.436 --> 02:51.637
- Hmm, hmm, what did I tell ya?

02:51.639 --> 02:52.838
- I like your spirit there.

02:52.840 --> 02:55.140
Some vigor, I like it.

02:55.142 --> 02:56.975
Hey, to the oval office.

02:56.977 --> 02:59.978
(light rock music)

03:19.266 --> 03:20.365
- I have a happy life.

03:20.367 --> 03:22.134
I'm a math teacher.

03:22.136 --> 03:23.202
Everything was going right

03:23.204 --> 03:26.238
but we were just
missing one thing,

03:26.240 --> 03:27.906
a child of our own.

03:29.476 --> 03:31.076
Wow.

03:31.078 --> 03:34.079
I can't believe it, the Chinese
are exporting babies now?

03:34.081 --> 03:36.148
- [Woman] Ko, Ko, Ko, they are
Korean.

03:36.150 --> 03:37.549
- Wait, what?

03:37.551 --> 03:38.850
Okay, I'm sorry.

03:38.852 --> 03:40.185
I just could never tell the
difference

03:40.187 --> 03:41.386
between them.

03:41.388 --> 03:43.088
- Look at me.

03:43.090 --> 03:44.156
I am Korean.

03:46.193 --> 03:47.593
That is Chinese.

03:52.499 --> 03:53.498
- Okay.

03:53.500 --> 03:54.700
What about him?

03:54.702 --> 03:58.337
- [Woman] He has Japanese
flag on his backpack.

03:58.339 --> 03:59.738
- [Ben] Okay?

03:59.740 --> 04:01.139
- He is Japanese.

04:01.141 --> 04:02.140
- What?

04:02.142 --> 04:03.041
Hey kid.

04:04.578 --> 04:06.712
(speaking Japanese) Mr. Roboto.

04:06.714 --> 04:07.746
- What?

04:07.748 --> 04:09.147
I'm Kazakh, bro.

04:10.017 --> 04:12.417
- Kate and I have been
trying for two years now,

04:12.419 --> 04:14.319
every single night.

04:14.321 --> 04:16.454
I'm not complaining, it's fun.

04:16.457 --> 04:18.690
I mean, it's a lot of fun.

04:20.027 --> 04:22.761
(kids shouting)

04:31.238 --> 04:33.038
Those little fuckers.

04:41.649 --> 04:43.982
(clanging)

04:43.984 --> 04:45.951
- [Man] What the fuck?!

04:47.655 --> 04:50.188
(kooky music)

04:57.931 --> 05:00.165
(sighing)

05:05.673 --> 05:07.906
(sighing)

05:11.712 --> 05:15.147
- Oh, you went to that
stupid clinic again?

05:15.149 --> 05:17.349
Honey, I thought we
agreed that we hate kids?

05:17.351 --> 05:19.451
Look at the neighbors,
their kids running around

05:19.453 --> 05:21.687
dropping hazardous balls
all over the neighborhood.

05:21.689 --> 05:23.255
We could sue them.

05:24.158 --> 05:25.157
- Nice try.

05:27.761 --> 05:29.328
- We have options.

05:30.331 --> 05:32.798
Jin-Ho showed me the photos
today.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.433
All younger than one year old.

05:34.435 --> 05:36.868
Baby what, we take three months

05:36.870 --> 05:39.938
from the time we choose one
and then another three months

05:39.940 --> 05:41.273
for the kid to come from Korea.

05:41.275 --> 05:42.307
Total of six months.

05:42.309 --> 05:43.475
- Six months?

05:43.477 --> 05:44.843
- Yeah, isn't that great?

05:44.845 --> 05:45.944
- Great, why is that great?

05:45.946 --> 05:47.412
- Well.

05:47.414 --> 05:51.216
If we would um, listen to
some Marvin Gaye tonight,

05:51.218 --> 05:55.020
the song wouldn't be done
for another nine months.

05:55.022 --> 05:57.889
But if we order a Korean baby,

05:57.891 --> 06:02.327
we don't have to play Marvin
Gaye and it's only six months.

06:02.329 --> 06:03.795
- Six months is a long time.

06:03.797 --> 06:06.765
You remember the last time
we played Marvin Gaye?

06:06.767 --> 06:08.834
That song is still playing.

06:08.836 --> 06:11.970
- Honey, don't haggle
over six and nine months.

06:11.972 --> 06:16.208
Jin-Ho said that we would
get used to the woo,

06:16.210 --> 06:20.512
wait woo, what do you mean
Marvin is still playing?

06:21.682 --> 06:24.816
- I said exactly what you think
I said.

06:24.818 --> 06:25.817
- You're,

06:25.819 --> 06:26.718
- Yup.

06:28.455 --> 06:30.255
In six months, your baby will be
kicking

06:30.257 --> 06:31.556
the shit out of me from the
inside

06:31.558 --> 06:32.858
if he's anything like you!

06:32.860 --> 06:35.794
(laughing)

06:35.796 --> 06:36.828
- Wait, stop!

06:36.830 --> 06:39.631
You don't jump up and down,
okay?

06:40.501 --> 06:44.102
- I'm gonna give you a bit of
advice, Ben.

06:44.104 --> 06:45.437
Never say next.

06:46.740 --> 06:49.508
'Cause soon as you say next,

06:49.510 --> 06:52.911
you'll be thinking well why not
three?

06:52.913 --> 06:54.379
And why not four?

06:56.150 --> 06:57.382
And then five.

06:58.585 --> 06:59.718
And then six.

07:01.355 --> 07:02.454
Huh?

07:02.456 --> 07:03.855
How can you not?

07:04.792 --> 07:06.591
But I'll tell you, once you get

07:06.593 --> 07:09.428
a half a dozen box of donuts,

07:09.430 --> 07:10.896
they control you.

07:12.533 --> 07:15.333
You have to deal with
all of their problems

07:15.335 --> 07:16.968
and you are fucked!

07:18.038 --> 07:19.171
- Language, sweetie!

07:19.173 --> 07:20.071
- See?

07:21.775 --> 07:24.643
- God, it can't be that bad.

07:24.645 --> 07:25.877
This is Chuck.

07:25.879 --> 07:27.279
He's kind of our neighbor.

07:27.281 --> 07:30.715
Well, he parks his apartment
in front of our house.

07:30.717 --> 07:33.084
He lives with Ingrid, his
girlfriend.

07:33.086 --> 07:37.222
And she works late nights,
if you know what I mean.

07:37.224 --> 07:39.191
But now she has a baby on the
way.

07:39.193 --> 07:41.927
(siren blaring)

07:42.996 --> 07:45.730
(phone ringing)

07:49.136 --> 07:51.369
(humming)

07:56.877 --> 07:58.210
- [Doctor] Ooh.

07:59.646 --> 08:01.446
- What is it, doctor?

08:04.251 --> 08:05.150
- Mmm, ah.

08:07.321 --> 08:08.653
We got to abort the baby.

08:08.655 --> 08:09.955
- [Ben And Kate] What?

08:09.957 --> 08:10.989
- Oh yeah.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.975
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:12.976 --> 08:14.960
I mean, there's really, I mean,
yeah.

08:15.762 --> 08:19.397
- I'm sorry, what do you mean
(mumbling)

08:19.399 --> 08:22.934
I can't do this, I can't
breathe, I can't (mumbling)

08:22.936 --> 08:24.769
- Okay, you know, okay, could
you stop?

08:24.771 --> 08:27.672
Please, listen, there is
something we can,

08:27.674 --> 08:29.574
are your fathers, both of you,

08:29.576 --> 08:32.077
are your fathers still alive?

08:33.447 --> 08:34.613
- [Both] Yes.

08:35.816 --> 08:38.799
- Okay.

08:38.801 --> 08:41.784
We can take the bone marrow
from both grandfathers,

08:41.788 --> 08:46.458
use it to repair the tissue
of the damaged fetus.

08:46.460 --> 08:48.493
Haha, very risky.

08:48.495 --> 08:53.031
But probably the only thing
we can do to save the baby.

08:53.033 --> 08:57.435
So, can both your fathers
come in for testing?

08:57.437 --> 08:58.503
- [Both] No.

09:03.443 --> 09:05.810
- Now, the idea is to
structure your campaign

09:05.812 --> 09:07.946
so that it very closely
mimics the rise

09:07.948 --> 09:09.714
of Donald Trump.

09:09.716 --> 09:10.882
That was quite a success.

09:10.884 --> 09:12.617
And with us, we can
guarantee you the support

09:12.619 --> 09:14.052
of President Biden.

09:14.054 --> 09:15.487
- That's good.

09:15.489 --> 09:19.491
But I mean that would be
a good model to pursue.

09:19.493 --> 09:21.493
Did I ever tell you
about the time

09:21.495 --> 09:22.827
the President grabbed
me by the crotch?

09:22.829 --> 09:24.246
Right in the cajones.

09:24.247 --> 09:25.664
- Actually, let me show
you something else here.

09:25.666 --> 09:29.000
What we have is Welly the
Welfare Bear.

09:30.070 --> 09:33.238
And right next to him,
Libby the Liberal Sloth.

09:33.240 --> 09:34.839
Now these are both excellent
examples

09:34.841 --> 09:36.341
of potential viral marketing.

09:36.343 --> 09:38.043
But the first thing we
need to do in all of this

09:38.045 --> 09:39.578
is to get you a wife.

09:39.580 --> 09:42.714
Nothing sells a president
like a wife and family.

09:42.716 --> 09:44.883
We of course need to hire
a social media director.

09:44.885 --> 09:48.820
- Man old man, do I have a treat
for you.

09:48.822 --> 09:50.121
- Hector, we are right in
the middle of something

09:50.123 --> 09:51.873
at this moment.

09:51.874 --> 09:53.624
- Gimme smiles, we are now
live on Facebook and Instagram.

09:53.627 --> 09:55.427
Hello followers!

09:55.429 --> 09:56.428
- And what is this?

09:56.430 --> 09:58.296
- Today I'm a matchmaker.

09:58.298 --> 10:00.031
- Oh no, no, we are not there
yet.

10:00.033 --> 10:01.132
I was just beginning
to get into the aspect

10:01.134 --> 10:02.534
of family and,
- Shh.

10:02.536 --> 10:05.437
First! (clapping)

10:08.375 --> 10:10.575
- [Gerald] Hector, that's my
girlfriend.

10:10.577 --> 10:13.478
- It's business and she was
cheap.

10:17.851 --> 10:18.750
Next!

10:21.855 --> 10:25.190
That one's my favorite,
she's so tight!

10:28.829 --> 10:31.663
Next! (clapping)

10:34.635 --> 10:37.035
- Well hello, Mr. Jefferson.

10:38.438 --> 10:40.639
- Hello, what's your name?

10:40.641 --> 10:43.842
- No talking to or feeding the
models.

10:49.082 --> 10:50.215
- I like this guy.

10:50.217 --> 10:52.684
- He's very um, very special.

10:54.988 --> 10:55.987
That's all.

10:55.989 --> 10:58.890
We're good here, thank you
Hector.

11:02.029 --> 11:03.028
- Let me get this right.

11:03.030 --> 11:05.964
His job is to go out and find me
a,

11:05.966 --> 11:07.866
a wife to escort to the multiple
events?

11:07.868 --> 11:08.967
- No, not exactly.

11:08.969 --> 11:10.802
He's actually our social media
director

11:10.804 --> 11:12.237
but it's more complicated than
that.

11:12.239 --> 11:15.140
He's my ex wife's sister's best
friend.

11:15.142 --> 11:16.474
- Okay, okay.

11:16.476 --> 11:17.342
- Yeah.

11:18.278 --> 11:19.611
- Social media director?

11:19.613 --> 11:20.612
- Yeah, he.

11:22.049 --> 11:23.348
No, no, no, no, no.

11:23.350 --> 11:25.083
No, no, no, I know what you're
thinking.

11:25.085 --> 11:26.084
Absolutely not.

11:26.086 --> 11:28.153
A political campaign is totally
different.

11:28.155 --> 11:32.223
- Gerald, we live in
unorthodox political times.

11:34.528 --> 11:36.961
Get him on the team.

11:36.963 --> 11:38.496
- Sir, are you sure?

11:38.498 --> 11:39.397
- Yes.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.739
(chill music)

11:57.818 --> 11:59.184
- Hamid.

11:59.186 --> 12:01.786
Please, let's just, let's focus

12:01.788 --> 12:03.154
and get back to the question,
okay?

12:03.156 --> 12:06.491
Because I'm sure, like
myself that the viewers

12:06.493 --> 12:09.561
would think that you are
deflecting.

12:13.333 --> 12:14.399
- Very well.

12:16.136 --> 12:18.770
Back to your questions.

12:18.772 --> 12:22.540
It takes me back to a
game from my childhood.

12:22.542 --> 12:25.877
- You can just answer a simple
yes or no.

12:25.879 --> 12:28.179
Do you think the US and Muslim
countries

12:28.181 --> 12:29.914
are natural enemies?

12:33.453 --> 12:35.620
- Are you afraid of this?

12:40.160 --> 12:41.426
- No.

12:41.428 --> 12:44.095
And that is very rude and so
inappropriate

12:44.097 --> 12:45.930
for this interview.

12:45.932 --> 12:47.198
- How about this?

12:47.200 --> 12:48.500
- No.

12:48.502 --> 12:49.334
- This?

12:49.336 --> 12:50.201
- No, don't, what are you doing?

12:50.203 --> 12:51.035
- This?

12:51.037 --> 12:51.870
- Hamid.

12:51.872 --> 12:52.704
Hamid, stop.

12:52.706 --> 12:53.538
- Hamid.

12:53.540 --> 12:54.339
- Hamid, I'm sorry.

12:54.341 --> 12:55.607
I'm sorry.

12:55.609 --> 12:57.442
How can I conduct this interview

12:57.444 --> 13:00.678
if you simply cannot stay on
topic?

13:00.680 --> 13:01.980
(clapping)

13:01.982 --> 13:02.981
- You see?

13:02.983 --> 13:04.682
You were afraid.

13:04.684 --> 13:07.152
You said you were not afraid.

13:24.471 --> 13:28.873
- 'Cause when people are
scared, they invest money.

13:28.875 --> 13:32.010
They spend money
on weapons, on food.

13:35.649 --> 13:36.548
On,

13:39.486 --> 13:40.952
on anything else.

13:48.862 --> 13:49.761
You see?

13:51.097 --> 13:53.498
There are no mortal enemies.

13:54.868 --> 13:57.101
There are only manufactured
enemies

13:57.103 --> 13:59.838
that serve for specific purpose.

14:02.275 --> 14:05.176
(phone vibrating)

14:10.884 --> 14:13.117
- How's it doing, darling?

14:14.154 --> 14:15.720
- No, not working.

14:18.425 --> 14:19.858
- [Chuck] This all right?

14:19.860 --> 14:20.692
- [Ingrid] No, no.

14:20.694 --> 14:22.727
- Could you, uh, could you help?

14:22.729 --> 14:24.829
- Yeah, I'll be right there,
honey?

14:24.831 --> 14:25.930
- [Kate] Great.

14:25.932 --> 14:27.732
- [Chuck] How about that,
does that work good?

14:27.734 --> 14:30.902
- It's wet a little over here.

14:30.904 --> 14:32.503
(thudding)

14:32.505 --> 14:33.338
- Ah!

14:33.340 --> 14:35.306
Ben, what in the world?

14:35.308 --> 14:36.708
- Ingrid, sorry.

14:37.777 --> 14:40.311
- Ah (mumbling)

14:40.313 --> 14:42.447
- [Ben] I'm sorry but I was
just trying to return the ball.

14:42.449 --> 14:43.448
- [Chuck] Don't worry about her.

14:43.450 --> 14:45.683
She's got a head of stone.

14:46.720 --> 14:48.987
- Okay sweety,
not the croutons bowl.

14:48.989 --> 14:50.722
Let's grab the burgers.

14:50.724 --> 14:52.957
A little distracted there,
aren't ya?

14:52.959 --> 14:54.726
So who were you calling?

14:54.728 --> 14:55.727
- No one.

14:55.729 --> 14:57.128
- No one, really?

14:57.130 --> 14:59.130
I have fire in my hand.

15:00.100 --> 15:01.566
- I was trying to get through to
my dad.

15:01.568 --> 15:02.467
- Oh.

15:03.770 --> 15:08.172
(man and woman humping and
moaning)

15:18.485 --> 15:21.452
(doorbell ringing)

15:32.599 --> 15:35.566
(doorbell ringing)

15:48.415 --> 15:49.447
- Katie.

15:49.449 --> 15:50.448
- Dad!

15:50.450 --> 15:51.449
- Hi, sweety.

15:51.451 --> 15:52.450
What a surprise.

15:52.452 --> 15:53.952
Come on, I just,

15:53.954 --> 15:55.320
I just try to get myself
together here.

15:55.322 --> 15:56.220
- Oh.

16:09.436 --> 16:11.970
(light music)

16:26.286 --> 16:29.954
- [Tucker] We can probably
both use one of this.

16:29.956 --> 16:30.955
- Ah, yeah.

16:32.859 --> 16:34.926
- I really did miss you.

16:38.198 --> 16:41.299
You might even remember that

16:41.301 --> 16:43.034
you still have a dad.

16:43.036 --> 16:45.436
- You know, maybe now
is not the best time.

16:45.438 --> 16:47.372
- No, no, no, no, don't
be silly, don't be silly.

16:47.374 --> 16:49.040
So what brings you?

16:54.414 --> 16:55.897
Oh, I know.

16:55.898 --> 16:57.381
You heard about my new
campaign, didn't you?

16:57.384 --> 16:59.283
Are you proud or what?

17:00.453 --> 17:03.221
Yes, all we need now is
President Biden's endorsement

17:03.223 --> 17:05.223
and we're golden, yeah.

17:10.997 --> 17:14.665
One of the reasons for his
success was his taste in
fashion.

17:14.666 --> 17:17.135
Now I know that isn't
everything of course,

17:17.137 --> 17:20.338
but it is an aspect of success.

17:20.339 --> 17:21.239
- Sure.

17:24.210 --> 17:27.310
- We're trying to
follow his model.

17:27.313 --> 17:31.716
And because we are, things
are definitely happening.

17:31.718 --> 17:35.119
So, what brings you
to see your old dad?

17:36.156 --> 17:37.221
- Well, dad.

17:39.025 --> 17:41.592
Ben and I need your help, dad.

17:42.729 --> 17:44.796
It's been seven years now, and,

17:44.798 --> 17:46.030
- Seven years?

17:47.267 --> 17:48.266
Seven years?

17:48.268 --> 17:49.801
- Yeah, seven years?

17:49.803 --> 17:54.906
- So an Iranian's been banging
my daughter for seven years?

17:54.908 --> 17:56.808
What fun, hey, cheers.

17:57.610 --> 18:01.145
- Oh, yeah, no, it's okay, I
can't.

18:01.147 --> 18:04.348
Look, I don't know how to say
this, but.

18:04.350 --> 18:07.752
The last seven years have been
fruitful.

18:10.490 --> 18:13.624
- Well, Katie, that sounds kind
of dirty.

18:13.626 --> 18:14.959
What do you mean?

18:14.961 --> 18:19.597
- Oh, okay what I mean is I
would like to be the first

18:19.599 --> 18:20.965
to call you Mister,

18:20.967 --> 18:22.867
- Hmm, Mister Senator?

18:25.472 --> 18:26.871
Maybe Mr. Future President?

18:26.873 --> 18:28.706
- Oh, no, no no.

18:28.708 --> 18:29.707
Give me a shot.

18:29.709 --> 18:31.342
Mister Grandfather.

18:34.547 --> 18:36.447
Oh, grandfather, yeah.

18:37.450 --> 18:40.017
(kooky music)

18:44.958 --> 18:46.057
- Congratulations.

18:46.059 --> 18:48.426
(laughing)

18:48.428 --> 18:49.560
Mmm, mmm, mm.

19:03.243 --> 19:05.309
We need his bone marrow.

19:11.818 --> 19:15.219
Please, you have to make him
understand.

19:20.793 --> 19:23.528
You have to make him understand.

19:30.470 --> 19:32.970
- What does (speaking in
foreign language) mean?

19:32.972 --> 19:34.572
- Ah.

19:34.574 --> 19:36.807
It means tell him in a way

19:38.378 --> 19:40.211
that he will understand.

19:40.213 --> 19:41.112
- Ah, oh.

19:44.184 --> 19:45.816
- You eat this apple, okay?

19:45.818 --> 19:46.717
- Okay.

19:48.588 --> 19:49.887
- I don't know what to do.

19:49.889 --> 19:52.757
She says my father won't come to
the US.

19:52.759 --> 19:54.125
- What, why?

19:54.127 --> 19:56.527
It isn't a political trip.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.829
Doesn't he love his family?

20:00.033 --> 20:02.833
- Kate, I have something
I have to tell you.

20:02.835 --> 20:05.336
I may have told my dad that your
father

20:05.338 --> 20:08.573
runs a hamburger cart for a
living.

20:08.575 --> 20:10.875
(laughing)

20:10.877 --> 20:14.045
- Oh no, you can't be serious.

20:14.047 --> 20:16.314
- I had to avoid
the politics thing.

20:16.316 --> 20:19.483
He'd have a breakdown. You
should have heard what he said

20:19.485 --> 20:21.719
when I told him I was
marrying an American.

20:21.721 --> 20:24.722
- Yeah well you should
have seen my father today.

20:24.724 --> 20:25.690
What, what?

20:26.993 --> 20:29.360
You want me to request
a visa for Ben's family?

20:29.362 --> 20:30.361
Trust you?

20:30.363 --> 20:32.897
What, you think I'm nuts?

20:32.899 --> 20:35.099
Anyway, he finally came
around when he found out

20:35.101 --> 20:36.834
it was for the baby.

20:37.804 --> 20:38.803
Speaking of which, did you get

20:38.805 --> 20:41.072
your family's passport numbers?

20:41.074 --> 20:42.240
- Ah, my auntie's gonna send
them

20:42.242 --> 20:43.841
but she hasn't sent them yet.

20:43.843 --> 20:45.209
She has to convince my father
first.

20:45.211 --> 20:47.912
- [Woman] Ladies and
gentlemen, thank you so much

20:47.914 --> 20:49.247
for flying with us.

20:49.249 --> 20:51.716
On our final approach, please
make sure

20:51.718 --> 20:53.584
your seat backs and trays
are in their upright

20:53.586 --> 20:54.852
and locked positions.

20:54.854 --> 20:56.954
We should be on the ground
shortly.

20:56.956 --> 20:59.523
(funky music)

21:08.101 --> 21:09.934
- Welcome to America.

21:12.672 --> 21:13.904
- Kiss my ass.

21:15.375 --> 21:17.208
- Sweet kid, next.

21:17.210 --> 21:18.042
Hi, how are you?

21:18.044 --> 21:18.876
- Very good, thank you.

21:18.878 --> 21:19.777
- Great.

21:23.082 --> 21:24.081
So could you do me a favor

21:24.083 --> 21:26.384
and put all four fingers
right there for me?

21:26.386 --> 21:30.121
Bring them closer together,
perfect.

21:30.123 --> 21:31.255
Oh, good.

21:31.257 --> 21:33.357
And sir, can I get you
to put your four fingers,

21:33.359 --> 21:34.659
does he speak English?

21:34.661 --> 21:36.827
Great, thank you so much.

21:38.998 --> 21:41.098
Okay, that's good.

21:41.100 --> 21:42.500
So uh, what, um,

21:44.470 --> 21:46.804
what brings you to America?

21:53.079 --> 21:54.945
- It was my humane duty to come
to this

21:54.947 --> 21:58.683
espionage nest despite
my political beliefs.

22:01.387 --> 22:02.787
- I'm not sure I heard you
right.

22:02.789 --> 22:04.288
Would you care to explain
yourself?

22:04.290 --> 22:05.923
- It's all written there in the
paper

22:05.925 --> 22:07.825
in front of you.

22:07.827 --> 22:11.462
It's for an innocent baby
who needs my bone marrow.

22:11.464 --> 22:14.031
He's an American citizen, so.

22:14.033 --> 22:15.599
You should be thanking me.

22:15.601 --> 22:17.234
And you're welcome.

22:19.672 --> 22:20.671
- You're right.

22:20.673 --> 22:23.240
That's exactly what that says.

22:24.877 --> 22:25.042
Okay.

22:28.781 --> 22:30.881
Well, on that, thank you very
much

22:30.883 --> 22:32.950
and welcome to America.

22:32.952 --> 22:34.685
- Thank you, thank you.

22:34.687 --> 22:35.586
- Next.

22:36.389 --> 22:37.788
Hi, how are you?

22:38.958 --> 22:41.192
(revving)

22:42.395 --> 22:44.195
- America travelogue.

22:44.197 --> 22:47.998
America from Hamid
Chikhamvari's perspective.

22:50.303 --> 22:54.939
What is going on behind
these towers and high-rises?

22:54.941 --> 22:58.509
American people's taxes are
spent on what?

23:00.680 --> 23:03.748
My son lives in a big gorgeous
house

23:04.851 --> 23:08.586
but it's American and
I don't trust America.

23:12.058 --> 23:13.991
- She looks too American, son.

23:13.993 --> 23:15.292
- Hey Kate.

23:15.294 --> 23:17.395
This is my father.

23:17.397 --> 23:19.096
Papa, Kate John.

23:19.098 --> 23:20.431
- Hello, father.

23:20.433 --> 23:22.767
We are so happy to have you.

23:22.769 --> 23:23.934
Are these all your luggages?

23:23.936 --> 23:24.835
Come on.

23:25.671 --> 23:26.771
- Me too.

23:26.772 --> 23:27.872
- I hope you brought your swim
trunks

23:27.874 --> 23:31.208
'cause we have a swimming pool.

23:31.210 --> 23:33.611
- I've never been kissed
by an American woman.

23:33.613 --> 23:34.879
- Oh you know, this is
the only American woman

23:34.881 --> 23:39.950
that can kiss you (speaking
in foreign language).

23:41.053 --> 23:42.219
- More than a few words.

23:42.221 --> 23:44.355
(speaking in foreign language)

23:44.357 --> 23:46.657
(laughing)

23:52.732 --> 23:54.965
- Benjamin, Benjamin, spy!

23:56.002 --> 23:57.234
- What, where?

24:02.141 --> 24:04.141
Hey Chuck, how are you?

24:04.143 --> 24:05.843
This is my father.

24:05.845 --> 24:07.978
- Oh, you're the spy.
(chuckling)

24:07.980 --> 24:09.947
Well, let me be the first to
welcome you

24:09.949 --> 24:12.116
to the United States of America.

24:12.118 --> 24:14.218
- Thank you, thank you.

24:14.220 --> 24:16.921
- Americans are aware here.

24:16.923 --> 24:19.323
They jump out of everywhere.

24:34.440 --> 24:37.808
- My sister wants to know
if Benjamin has bothered you

24:37.810 --> 24:39.243
all this time.

24:39.245 --> 24:41.512
- Ben is very good to me.

24:41.514 --> 24:42.480
I love him.

24:43.950 --> 24:46.917
And thank you for the
compliment.

24:46.919 --> 24:48.819
- So you are Ben now?

24:48.821 --> 24:51.188
You change your name?

24:51.190 --> 24:52.723
Hmm.

24:52.725 --> 24:55.626
Unfortunately, Benjamin
and us are very different

24:55.628 --> 24:57.394
in our beliefs.

24:57.396 --> 25:00.097
He hasn't taken after me at all.

25:00.099 --> 25:03.467
That's why I must
ask to make sure

25:03.469 --> 25:05.636
he doesn't beat you, surely.

25:05.638 --> 25:07.471
(coughing)

25:07.473 --> 25:08.439
- Beat me?

25:08.441 --> 25:09.874
Oh no, no.

25:09.876 --> 25:11.809
He is a very loving husband.

25:11.811 --> 25:14.478
(heroic music)

25:20.086 --> 25:22.653
(light music)

25:23.956 --> 25:25.656
- If you hate America so much,

25:25.658 --> 25:28.559
why did you send
me here to study?

25:32.865 --> 25:35.666
Why are you so afraid
of everyone finding out

25:35.668 --> 25:38.068
that your son is in America?

25:40.773 --> 25:43.941
- I wanted you to get
your degree and return

25:43.943 --> 25:46.343
just like I did.

25:48.180 --> 25:50.881
I came here when I was 18.

25:50.883 --> 25:54.518
I studied for five years
then I returned to Iran

25:54.520 --> 25:58.322
where there was a revolution
so I could help my people.

25:58.324 --> 26:00.391
- You were a hippy for
God's sake.

26:00.393 --> 26:02.126
- Shh, I told you to never say
that again.

26:02.128 --> 26:03.127
That is fake news.

26:03.129 --> 26:04.161
- Fake news?

26:04.163 --> 26:05.663
Fake news?

26:05.665 --> 26:07.131
I saw the photos.

26:08.167 --> 26:10.534
And besides,
who am I shushing for?

26:10.536 --> 26:13.337
Look, we're literally
alone here.

26:17.677 --> 26:20.578
- I grew my hair
when I was young.

26:22.348 --> 26:24.448
It was in fashion those days.

26:24.450 --> 26:27.484
Having long hair doesn't
mean you're a hippy.

26:27.486 --> 26:28.953
- Come on, baba.

26:28.955 --> 26:30.554
You went to a Grateful Dead
concert

26:30.556 --> 26:32.556
and you took mushrooms.

26:37.830 --> 26:40.464
- Whatever I did, I didn't grow
up roots

26:40.466 --> 26:42.399
or get married.

26:42.401 --> 26:44.301
God bless your mother.

26:45.605 --> 26:46.503
- Well.

26:47.340 --> 26:49.607
You can't control love.

26:49.609 --> 26:51.508
You just fall into it.

26:52.311 --> 26:53.711
- You fell in love with an
American

26:53.713 --> 26:55.279
just to disagree with me.

26:55.281 --> 26:58.115
- Baba, everything
isn't about you.

26:58.117 --> 27:00.150
I fell in love with Kate.

27:00.152 --> 27:01.619
I love Kate.

27:01.621 --> 27:05.289
And I'd love her even
if she were a monkey.

27:07.760 --> 27:09.259
- How about your job?

27:09.261 --> 27:11.795
- Well, I teach math
at the University.

27:11.797 --> 27:13.697
- You make good money?

27:15.067 --> 27:18.102
- I have a lot of bills, but I
thank God.

27:18.104 --> 27:20.137
- Your expenses will double
when you become a father.

27:20.139 --> 27:21.372
You know that?

27:22.975 --> 27:24.375
You have a plan?

27:26.078 --> 27:27.211
No you don't.

27:29.015 --> 27:30.014
Okay.

27:30.016 --> 27:32.316
(speaking in foreign language)

27:32.318 --> 27:34.652
(laughing)

27:41.961 --> 27:43.761
Do you need anything?

27:46.999 --> 27:48.999
- Give me your car key.

27:49.935 --> 27:50.834
- My car?

27:52.672 --> 27:54.204
I can take you wherever
you wanna go.

27:54.206 --> 27:56.640
- Nah, I wanna see
the world by myself.

27:56.642 --> 27:59.009
- Do you even know
how to drive here?

27:59.011 --> 28:02.312
- Do not question
your father's abilities.

28:02.314 --> 28:03.714
Give me the key.

28:05.184 --> 28:07.518
- Okay, they're downstairs.

28:08.854 --> 28:11.355
(rock music)

28:18.097 --> 28:20.631
I know exactly what he's
thinking.

28:20.633 --> 28:22.399
There are cameras everywhere.

28:22.401 --> 28:23.300
Oh, a spy.

28:25.271 --> 28:28.138
I can't believe these
girls with their hair

28:28.140 --> 28:29.506
flowing right in front of me,

28:29.508 --> 28:31.575
have they no morals?

28:31.577 --> 28:33.177
Is that a prostitute?

28:33.179 --> 28:34.912
He's so predictable.

29:19.458 --> 29:22.693
(pool balls clacking)

29:26.432 --> 29:31.268
- You my friend, look like
you could use one of these.

29:31.270 --> 29:32.770
- Actually, I'll have a water

29:32.772 --> 29:35.906
in a bottle please with the cap
closed.

29:35.908 --> 29:36.907
- Are you sure?

29:36.909 --> 29:38.642
It's happy hour.

29:38.644 --> 29:40.778
- I'll stick with the water.

29:40.780 --> 29:41.779
- Serve yourself.

29:41.781 --> 29:43.447
Water's over there.

29:47.987 --> 29:48.886
- Okay.

29:51.157 --> 29:54.391
So no reporter, no official to
ask me

29:54.393 --> 29:58.796
what the hell are you doing
in this damn bar, clock.

30:01.901 --> 30:03.567
Only me and my God.

30:04.970 --> 30:05.869
Oh God!

30:06.872 --> 30:10.107
How lovely it feels to be so
light.

30:10.109 --> 30:11.208
Hey brother.

30:11.210 --> 30:12.209
Do you know how it works?

30:12.211 --> 30:14.745
I kind of forgotten a bit.

30:14.747 --> 30:17.381
- Don't have this back
where you come from?

30:17.383 --> 30:18.282
- Ah.

30:19.952 --> 30:21.552
- You an Arab?

30:21.554 --> 30:22.452
- No!

30:23.923 --> 30:25.122
- Pakistani, Muslim?

30:25.124 --> 30:28.025
- Iran, and this is none of your
business.

30:28.027 --> 30:29.493
- You say Iran?

30:29.494 --> 30:30.960
I was an Iraq vet you
know, you're welcome.

30:30.963 --> 30:31.862
- Iran.

30:33.732 --> 30:36.400
Iraq is here and Iran is here,

30:36.402 --> 30:39.336
it's a neighboring, and I
have nothing to thank you for.

30:39.338 --> 30:40.404
- Oh, I said that yeah.

30:40.406 --> 30:43.807
So yeah, oof, that place is a
real hell.

30:44.810 --> 30:45.809
Yeah, I was there.

30:45.811 --> 30:46.810
Boom, boom!

30:46.812 --> 30:49.580
(banging)

30:49.582 --> 30:51.615
Name's Joe, pleasure.

30:51.617 --> 30:52.616
What's your name?

30:52.618 --> 30:53.517
- Hamid.

31:04.496 --> 31:06.096
- Did you say Habibi?

31:06.098 --> 31:08.098
Hami, Hadi, Hamini?

31:08.100 --> 31:09.099
- Hamid.

31:09.101 --> 31:12.436
- Hamid, Hamid, right, right,
right.

31:12.438 --> 31:13.904
Look at this guy, man.

31:13.906 --> 31:14.905
- Ah!

31:14.907 --> 31:15.906
- Saddam.

31:15.908 --> 31:18.876
Yeah I pulled him out of the
hole.

31:18.878 --> 31:20.777
- Where are you in the photo?

31:20.779 --> 31:23.914
- Right there, that's my foot.

31:23.916 --> 31:26.450
Can't you see the resemblance?

31:26.452 --> 31:28.385
- Hahah, this is photoshopped.

31:28.387 --> 31:29.887
- What, no!

31:29.889 --> 31:30.921
No, it's real.

31:30.923 --> 31:33.790
Why would I lie about my foot?

31:33.792 --> 31:35.158
Look.

31:35.160 --> 31:36.393
IED, roadside.

31:40.399 --> 31:41.865
You know where Iraq is, right?

31:41.867 --> 31:43.967
- You just thought I was Iraqi.

31:43.969 --> 31:45.202
- Oh right, yes, yes.

31:45.204 --> 31:46.937
So you know it then.

31:48.007 --> 31:50.240
Let me just tell you, man.

31:51.510 --> 31:54.311
Ah shit, it's gone, it's gone.

31:54.313 --> 31:55.512
- Listen to me.

31:55.514 --> 31:56.847
You fought Saddam.

31:56.849 --> 32:00.918
We fought Saddam for eight
fucking years.

32:00.920 --> 32:02.386
I was in the war.

32:02.388 --> 32:04.788
I was on the front line.

32:04.790 --> 32:07.424
I was shot in the war.

32:07.426 --> 32:11.028
And let me show you something,
my friend.

32:11.030 --> 32:12.596
You see this coin?

32:15.935 --> 32:16.833
- Dude.

32:17.770 --> 32:19.937
Here, let me show you,
check this out, huh?

32:19.939 --> 32:20.771
Look at that.

32:20.773 --> 32:21.638
- Oh, no.

32:21.640 --> 32:22.539
Oh my god.

32:23.575 --> 32:25.108
I'm gonna puke, no, no, no.

32:25.110 --> 32:26.510
- See, why, man?

32:28.013 --> 32:29.379
What for, huh?

32:29.381 --> 32:32.916
Baghdad, Kurkukaita, what for,
man, huh?

32:32.918 --> 32:34.284
What for, huh?

32:34.286 --> 32:37.788
Yeah I think I'm
gonna puke too, shit.

32:37.790 --> 32:39.122
Shit!

32:39.124 --> 32:39.957
Where are we?

32:39.959 --> 32:41.558
Shock and awe!

32:41.560 --> 32:42.793
Shock and awe!

32:45.030 --> 32:46.029
Dah, sorry.

32:47.833 --> 32:48.732
Sorry.

32:52.104 --> 32:53.704
- You know what,

32:53.706 --> 32:58.008
my friend, I think you need
this water more than I.

32:59.078 --> 33:00.644
- Later, Muhammad.

33:05.551 --> 33:08.151
(belching)

33:08.153 --> 33:10.988
(birds chirping)

33:12.358 --> 33:13.757
- Father, Daddy?

33:15.127 --> 33:17.361
(snoring)

33:24.903 --> 33:27.137
I know we've had problems
understanding each other.

33:27.139 --> 33:30.073
But the one thing I can't
deny is that he loves me.

33:30.075 --> 33:32.042
And I love him too.

33:32.044 --> 33:34.277
After all, he's my father.

33:36.749 --> 33:38.782
Look how cute he sleeps.

33:41.153 --> 33:42.853
- What, what?!

33:42.855 --> 33:44.921
Was I speaking in my sleep?

33:44.923 --> 33:46.056
Was I snoring?

33:46.058 --> 33:48.458
- Baba, you seem very tired.

33:49.428 --> 33:51.161
- No, I'm not tired.

33:52.164 --> 33:54.564
Your father-in-law has come?

33:55.467 --> 33:56.366
No!

33:58.737 --> 33:59.569
- Baba?

33:59.571 --> 34:00.404
- More to the middle.

34:00.406 --> 34:01.705
- Uh huh.

34:01.706 --> 34:03.005
I have something very
important I have to tell you

34:03.008 --> 34:04.074
about Kate's father.

34:04.076 --> 34:06.176
- Down, what, is it too bad?

34:06.178 --> 34:09.312
- Well, um, he's a
really simple man.

34:10.516 --> 34:12.516
He only knows about burgers.

34:12.518 --> 34:14.918
- Up, up, you need to
find the spot.

34:14.920 --> 34:17.387
- He doesn't talk
politics at all.

34:17.389 --> 34:19.656
You know, in fact,
he hates politics.

34:19.658 --> 34:22.192
- Why are you telling
me all this?

34:22.194 --> 34:23.960
- Because, that's all you
talk about, is politics.

34:23.962 --> 34:25.629
- Says who?

34:25.630 --> 34:26.929
I am not a kid.

34:27.900 --> 34:30.534
He's a human being, right?

34:30.536 --> 34:33.136
Another ignorant
American citizen

34:33.138 --> 34:36.206
who doesn't have
the slightest idea

34:36.208 --> 34:40.777
in what country the tax he
pays is making troubles.

34:40.779 --> 34:43.346
He's not a lobbyist or Senator

34:44.349 --> 34:46.349
so I won't punch his face.

34:46.351 --> 34:48.652
- Baba, I'm saying,
stop it, goddamit.

34:48.654 --> 34:51.655
I mean this is what I'm
telling you not to say, okay?

34:51.657 --> 34:55.958
And, I told him that you
work in a pistachio grove.

34:57.396 --> 34:58.395
- What?

34:58.397 --> 34:59.396
We sold the pistachio groves

34:59.398 --> 35:02.099
like some 10 years ago!

35:02.101 --> 35:03.133
- You had a pistachio grove?

35:03.135 --> 35:04.134
Like for real?

35:04.136 --> 35:05.235
- Yeah.

35:05.237 --> 35:08.105
- Okay.

35:08.106 --> 35:10.974
But what I'm telling you is
no politics tonight, okay?

35:14.079 --> 35:14.978
- Okay.

35:19.184 --> 35:20.183
- Kate.

35:20.185 --> 35:21.084
- Dad.

35:26.558 --> 35:27.591
- What a cute little house.

35:27.593 --> 35:29.860
- Oh, yeah, thanks.

35:29.862 --> 35:33.497
Yeah, you're finally
visiting us, huh?

35:33.499 --> 35:34.931
- Thanks to this little baby.

35:34.933 --> 35:35.732
Not me.

35:35.734 --> 35:37.667
- Right, of course.

35:39.638 --> 35:40.888
Oh hey, um.

35:40.889 --> 35:42.139
There's just something
I need to tell you.

35:42.141 --> 35:43.807
- Yes, Kate?

35:43.809 --> 35:46.176
- Listen, it is not a big deal,

35:46.178 --> 35:48.712
but I sort of told Ben's
family that you own

35:48.714 --> 35:50.780
a little hamburger cart.

35:54.119 --> 35:55.752
- A hamburger cart?

35:58.924 --> 36:00.657
Well I guess if owning
seven percent

36:00.659 --> 36:02.692
of McDonald's shares makes
it a small hamburger cart

36:02.694 --> 36:03.693
so be it.

36:03.695 --> 36:04.694
- Great.

36:04.696 --> 36:05.729
- And that's okay, let's go.

36:05.731 --> 36:06.663
- All right.

36:06.665 --> 36:07.564
Oh, also.

36:09.201 --> 36:10.767
They hate politics.

36:10.769 --> 36:12.169
That's why I didn't tell
them that you're running

36:12.171 --> 36:13.503
for the senate, so if
we could just

36:13.505 --> 36:15.205
maybe avoid politics at all
costs today.

36:15.207 --> 36:17.841
- Katie, just calm down, okay?

36:17.843 --> 36:18.875
Now let's go meet and greet

36:18.877 --> 36:21.144
the Iranian pistachio farmer,
shall we?

36:21.146 --> 36:22.045
- Great.

36:24.616 --> 36:27.083
Just don't get into politics.

36:28.954 --> 36:30.320
- Kate, what is the problem?

36:30.322 --> 36:32.455
Why do you keep
repeating yourself?

36:32.457 --> 36:33.757
I get it, okay?

36:34.960 --> 36:39.596
This is a night off and I
will not talk any politics.

36:39.598 --> 36:41.097
- Great.

36:41.099 --> 36:42.465
Let's do this.

36:42.467 --> 36:43.433
- Let's.

36:43.435 --> 36:44.568
- All right.

36:44.570 --> 36:45.835
Okay, after you.

36:45.837 --> 36:46.836
- Thank you.

36:46.838 --> 36:47.737
- Uh huh.

36:48.874 --> 36:49.873
Game time, all right.

36:49.875 --> 36:52.842
(Tucker chuckling)

37:04.189 --> 37:05.522
(clearing throat)

37:05.524 --> 37:08.358
- Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.

37:08.360 --> 37:09.859
This dish.

37:09.861 --> 37:11.261
It's incredible!

37:12.931 --> 37:14.130
I love Iranian food.

37:14.132 --> 37:15.465
- Yeah?

37:15.467 --> 37:19.436
Have you ever tried
traditional Iranian dishes?

37:20.739 --> 37:21.638
- Um yes.

37:22.708 --> 37:26.409
Matter of fact,
I was in Iran twice

37:26.411 --> 37:27.811
during the time of the shock.

37:27.813 --> 37:29.045
(coughing)

37:29.047 --> 37:32.382
- Dad, isn't this spicy for you?

37:32.384 --> 37:35.952
- No, no, it's great,
it's fantastic, Kate.

37:35.954 --> 37:39.189
- So you have been twice
to Iran, how interesting.

37:39.191 --> 37:41.891
For business or on holiday?

37:41.893 --> 37:43.326
- Surprise!

37:43.328 --> 37:44.561
We have twins.

37:45.497 --> 37:46.763
- Twins?

37:46.765 --> 37:48.231
- That's right.

37:48.233 --> 37:49.065
- [Hamid] Really?

37:49.067 --> 37:49.900
- Two of them.

37:49.901 --> 37:50.734
- [Auntie] Oh my god
you have twins?

37:50.736 --> 37:53.103
- Uh huh.

37:53.104 --> 37:55.471
- Hamid, you are going to
have two grandchildren!

37:55.474 --> 37:58.475
- And your expenses
will triple now.

37:58.477 --> 38:00.110
- Hey, Katie, why didn't
you tell us before?

38:00.112 --> 38:01.811
I mean this is beautiful.

38:01.813 --> 38:03.380
- Yes, dad, it is.

38:04.249 --> 38:05.849
Very beautiful.

38:05.851 --> 38:07.350
- [Tucker] Yeah.

38:07.352 --> 38:08.785
- [Ben] So far so good.

38:08.787 --> 38:11.187
Looks like this
may just work out.

38:11.189 --> 38:12.522
They seem to be getting along.

38:12.524 --> 38:15.292
In fact it looks like they
may become friends, yes!

38:15.294 --> 38:17.093
- [Hamid] Indeed.

38:17.095 --> 38:19.262
I read that when a
couple conceives late,

38:19.264 --> 38:22.265
having twins becomes
very probable.

38:23.902 --> 38:25.802
- [Tucker] Yeah?

38:25.804 --> 38:26.803
- [Hamid] Not with the hand.

38:26.805 --> 38:28.371
Go get some tongs.

38:29.574 --> 38:30.540
- [Hamid] You could have
burned your fingers.

38:30.542 --> 38:31.908
- I'm gonna go get the tongs.

38:31.910 --> 38:33.576
I'll be right back.

38:34.880 --> 38:36.546
(hookah bubbling)

38:36.548 --> 38:40.884
- You know, I smoked
one of these in Turkey.

38:40.886 --> 38:42.519
It was really good.

38:43.555 --> 38:44.688
- Let me tell you something.

38:44.690 --> 38:47.123
The tobacco is special.

38:47.125 --> 38:49.492
Would you like to try some?

38:49.494 --> 38:51.328
- Ah, no, I better not.

38:51.330 --> 38:52.762
I got this,

38:52.764 --> 38:55.332
I have this pain in the back of
my chest.

38:55.334 --> 38:59.002
I know it's weird but
it might be my heart.

38:59.004 --> 39:00.003
I don't know.

39:00.005 --> 39:02.172
- Ah, it's not the heart.

39:02.174 --> 39:03.073
- No?

39:04.476 --> 39:06.910
- You sit at a desk a lot.

39:06.912 --> 39:08.278
- Yeah.

39:08.280 --> 39:09.379
- Let me show you something.

39:09.381 --> 39:11.047
Stand up.

39:11.049 --> 39:12.048
Stand up.

39:12.050 --> 39:12.949
Come here.

39:15.520 --> 39:18.021
I know traditional medicine,
turn around.

39:18.023 --> 39:19.622
Turn around.

39:19.624 --> 39:20.924
- Why?

39:20.926 --> 39:22.592
- I'll show you, I'll show you.

39:22.594 --> 39:23.860
- What are you doing?

39:23.862 --> 39:24.861
- Wait, wait a minute.

39:24.863 --> 39:25.862
You'll feel better.

39:25.864 --> 39:27.263
No I insist, I insist.

39:27.265 --> 39:29.482
- This is weird.

39:29.483 --> 39:31.700
- No, no, you will see,
you will see. (cracking)

39:31.703 --> 39:32.769
- Wow, jeez.

39:34.606 --> 39:35.438
Whoah.

39:35.440 --> 39:36.673
- Now tell me how do you feel?

39:36.675 --> 39:37.674
- Kind of good.

39:37.676 --> 39:38.675
- Great!

39:38.677 --> 39:39.676
You see?

39:39.678 --> 39:41.028
- Yes.

39:41.029 --> 39:42.379
- It has nothing to do
with the heart, young man.

39:42.381 --> 39:43.947
- You're right.

39:43.949 --> 39:46.950
I've never had a man
do that to me before.

39:46.952 --> 39:48.418
Jeez, I hope there
was nobody looking.

39:48.420 --> 39:49.519
You know.

39:49.521 --> 39:50.553
- What?

39:50.555 --> 39:52.389
- Well, I don't know,
you know this is,

39:52.391 --> 39:53.723
not that I (mumbling)

39:53.725 --> 39:54.724
you're not gay, are you?

39:54.726 --> 39:55.992
- Who's gay?

39:55.994 --> 39:57.460
Of course not.

39:57.462 --> 39:58.895
Gay.

39:58.897 --> 40:00.263
- I didn't think so.

40:00.265 --> 40:01.498
Of course not.

40:02.901 --> 40:04.934
But you know, not that I'm
against.

40:04.936 --> 40:08.938
Equality is a part of my
platform for Congress.

40:11.009 --> 40:12.909
- What Congress?

40:12.911 --> 40:15.812
There's Congress now
for hamburger sellers?

40:15.814 --> 40:18.114
(laughing)

40:19.284 --> 40:22.185
- You know, the American
Congress.

40:23.088 --> 40:24.754
I plan to go there.

40:25.590 --> 40:26.556
- Go where?

40:27.626 --> 40:29.626
You opening a cart there?

40:29.628 --> 40:31.227
- No.

40:31.229 --> 40:35.298
You know, the American
Congress for god's sakes.

40:37.636 --> 40:40.370
It's, you've heard of
American Senators?

40:40.372 --> 40:42.172
- [Ben] Oh shit.

40:42.174 --> 40:44.274
Never mind, I spoke too soon.

40:44.276 --> 40:45.642
(clanking)

40:45.644 --> 40:49.212
- Uh, what are you doing
here, who's watching them?

40:49.214 --> 40:51.047
- I'm looking for something
to grab the charcoals with.

40:51.049 --> 40:52.449
- Okay, but never
mind that, just go.

40:52.451 --> 40:53.450
- Where's Auntie?

40:53.452 --> 40:55.618
- She's upstairs napping.

40:59.090 --> 41:01.191
- What are we gonna do
about the twins issue?

41:01.193 --> 41:03.426
- Well, I couldn't think of
anything else to distract them.

41:03.428 --> 41:05.762
- [Hamid] Warheads,
Mr. Hiroshima Nagasaki!

41:05.764 --> 41:07.030
- Let me tell you something.

41:07.032 --> 41:10.834
Iran is the cause of all the
chaos in the middle east.

41:10.836 --> 41:13.236
You are the axis of evil.

41:13.238 --> 41:15.472
- You are the, great tech!

41:22.914 --> 41:25.482
- We're gonna choke
you with sanctions!

41:25.484 --> 41:27.116
- He didn't mean that,
he's fine.

41:27.118 --> 41:28.885
(shouting over each other)

41:28.887 --> 41:31.120
I just had one request dad,
that's all.

41:31.122 --> 41:32.989
(chuckling)

41:32.991 --> 41:34.891
- They're nuts.

41:34.893 --> 41:37.627
So these two just met each
other?

41:37.629 --> 41:41.264
(shouting over each other)

41:47.639 --> 41:50.540
Wow. (chuckling)

41:50.542 --> 41:54.544
- Why all these interference in
the world?

41:54.546 --> 41:57.447
Why all these invasions and
plots?

41:59.885 --> 42:03.553
Just to control the
oil and weapons market?

42:05.924 --> 42:08.825
America is vast, it's a
continent.

42:11.663 --> 42:12.729
Plant wheat.

42:12.731 --> 42:18.835
Do agriculture and farming and
God will grant you anything.

42:20.305 --> 42:21.504
- Okay.

42:21.506 --> 42:24.407
Okay, that (laughing),

42:24.409 --> 42:25.842
that's it man, that's brilliant.

42:25.844 --> 42:27.610
You a writer or something?

42:27.612 --> 42:29.112
Ah, what's your name?

42:29.114 --> 42:30.346
Nah, never mind.

42:30.348 --> 42:31.614
Just gonna forget it anyway.

42:31.616 --> 42:33.283
Hamid, I got it.

42:33.285 --> 42:34.751
You know, when I,

42:38.123 --> 42:40.023
when I slit my wrists,

42:41.159 --> 42:44.127
I was laying in the bathtub and
I saw,

42:44.129 --> 42:47.564
I saw this bright light and I
saw it

42:47.566 --> 42:51.701
getting brighter and
brighter and brighter.

42:51.703 --> 42:53.136
- Oh.

42:53.138 --> 42:54.871
You Americans are sick.

42:54.873 --> 42:58.641
You take a selfie even
in a bloody bathtub?

42:58.643 --> 42:59.542
- Betsy.

43:01.446 --> 43:05.415
Betsy was in that bright light
too, man.

43:05.417 --> 43:07.684
She kept saying to me, Joe.

43:07.686 --> 43:09.552
Joe, you gotta,

43:09.554 --> 43:11.020
you gotta get clean.

43:11.022 --> 43:12.522
America's gotta get clean.

43:12.524 --> 43:14.290
You know, darkness is coming

43:14.292 --> 43:16.025
and you gotta be the janitor.

43:16.027 --> 43:18.928
You gotta get your message out
to,

43:21.099 --> 43:23.232
- Ah, I lost my wife too.

43:24.502 --> 43:26.169
But please, please leave me
alone.

43:26.171 --> 43:28.538
I haven't had a great night
either.

43:28.540 --> 43:31.474
I'm not in good mood
for such things, please.

43:31.476 --> 43:33.142
- Fine, fine, I'm just, you
know,

43:33.144 --> 43:34.243
it's all right with me.

43:34.245 --> 43:36.479
I just got PTSD and severe
memory loss.

43:36.481 --> 43:39.048
It's (sighing) whatever man.

43:39.050 --> 43:42.285
Everything's fine with me, hunky
dory.

43:44.889 --> 43:45.788
So, pfft.

43:47.325 --> 43:50.860
What have you seen in
this great big beautiful

43:50.862 --> 43:53.196
city of angels of ours, huh?

43:53.198 --> 43:55.465
- I have seen some places.

43:55.467 --> 43:57.066
- Okay, I'm gonna show
you a place tomorrow,

43:57.068 --> 43:58.067
you're gonna love it.

43:58.069 --> 43:59.235
It's great for people watching.

43:59.237 --> 44:01.004
- I'm sorry, I can't tomorrow.

44:01.006 --> 44:02.238
I have a test.

44:03.074 --> 44:04.073
- Really?

44:04.075 --> 44:05.341
You're getting your GED?

44:05.343 --> 44:08.044
- No, no, no,
it's a hospital test.

44:08.046 --> 44:10.580
- Shit, you're dying?

44:10.582 --> 44:11.848
- I wish.

44:11.850 --> 44:13.349
- Yeah, I hear you.

44:13.351 --> 44:14.417
I feel you, man.

44:14.419 --> 44:16.119
(sighing) Which hospital?

44:16.121 --> 44:17.571
- Mercy.

44:17.572 --> 44:19.022
- Mercy, okay, I'll come and
get you after the hospital.

44:19.024 --> 44:20.657
- No, but you know.

44:21.993 --> 44:24.327
- See you tomorrow, my man.

44:25.096 --> 44:25.995
Haha!

44:28.199 --> 44:29.599
Chachachachacha!

44:34.906 --> 44:37.140
(humming)

44:47.919 --> 44:51.087
- Why do they need
a needle that big?

44:53.558 --> 44:56.693
- I'm afraid it's
nothing but a CIA plot.

44:56.695 --> 45:00.430
They plan to eliminate
me with bioterrorism.

45:01.433 --> 45:04.834
They just give you a
shot and it's over.

45:08.807 --> 45:10.206
Shame on you.

45:10.208 --> 45:12.241
You don't even trust
your own son?

45:12.243 --> 45:13.476
- He's naive.

45:13.478 --> 45:15.378
He doesn't know such things.

45:15.380 --> 45:18.281
He's facing a scamming system.

45:18.283 --> 45:20.516
It's nothing but CIA.

45:20.518 --> 45:22.452
They eliminate anybody in the
world

45:22.454 --> 45:24.087
who's against them.

45:37.936 --> 45:39.068
- Okey dokey.

45:40.171 --> 45:41.170
You're gonna have to leave the
room.

45:41.172 --> 45:42.338
- Yes.

45:42.340 --> 45:43.406
- Thank you.

45:45.076 --> 45:47.977
You, I need you to get
naked, throw that on,

45:47.979 --> 45:49.812
bend over and turn around.

45:49.814 --> 45:51.013
- What?

45:51.015 --> 45:52.582
(chuckling)

45:52.584 --> 45:53.483
- I mean.

45:58.256 --> 45:59.388
- Hi.

45:59.390 --> 46:01.891
It's all signed, here you go.

46:05.063 --> 46:06.195
- Hey, honey.

46:08.032 --> 46:09.065
- When's your dad coming?

46:09.067 --> 46:10.500
- Oh, I told him to come in an
hour

46:10.502 --> 46:12.268
so they don't have to face each
other.

46:12.270 --> 46:14.203
- You know, I don't think
this could go on like this.

46:14.205 --> 46:16.272
I think you got to talk to my
dad.

46:16.274 --> 46:17.406
- What, why me?

46:17.408 --> 46:19.976
- Because, you're so pregnant.

46:20.812 --> 46:24.213
He can't get mad at a
pregnant lady, right?

46:24.215 --> 46:26.415
- Fine, you're right.

46:26.417 --> 46:27.517
(sighing)

46:27.519 --> 46:28.417
- Say it.

46:29.187 --> 46:30.186
- No.

46:30.188 --> 46:31.020
- Come on.

46:31.022 --> 46:32.288
Please, just this one.

46:32.290 --> 46:33.089
- Ugh, fine.

46:33.091 --> 46:35.324
Ben, you are always right.

46:35.326 --> 46:36.859
You are the essence of
rightness.

46:36.861 --> 46:37.860
No one in the history of the
world

46:37.862 --> 46:39.862
has ever been as right as you.
Happy?

46:39.864 --> 46:40.763
- Mhmm.

46:45.136 --> 46:46.869
I love you, come on.

46:50.175 --> 46:52.308
- All righty, looks good.

46:55.446 --> 46:56.279
(groaning)

46:56.281 --> 46:57.146
- Hi.

46:57.148 --> 46:59.215
Sorry, do you mind if I just,

46:59.217 --> 47:00.249
- [Doctor] What?

47:00.251 --> 47:02.585
Yeah, come on in, have fun.

47:04.522 --> 47:05.421
- Oh, uh.

47:07.225 --> 47:09.792
(kooky music)

47:12.764 --> 47:13.663
Hamid?

47:14.465 --> 47:15.832
- Oh hey, Kate.

47:15.834 --> 47:16.666
- Hi.

47:16.668 --> 47:17.500
How you doing?

47:17.502 --> 47:19.235
- Oh, never better.

47:19.237 --> 47:20.369
- Oh good, great.

47:20.371 --> 47:21.504
- Marvelous.

47:21.506 --> 47:22.338
- Wonderful, this'll

47:22.340 --> 47:25.575
(stomach gurgling)
take a second.

47:25.577 --> 47:30.146
Um, look I just wanted to
say sorry about last night.

47:30.148 --> 47:33.416
Perhaps we should have
told you everything sooner.

47:33.418 --> 47:37.553
- That's fine, as long
as the twins are good.

47:37.555 --> 47:39.555
- Yeah, um, about that.

47:40.625 --> 47:41.624
I'm sorry I lied.

47:41.626 --> 47:43.359
We're not having twins.

47:43.361 --> 47:44.527
- What?

47:44.529 --> 47:46.362
- One baby, singular.

47:47.699 --> 47:50.767
I'm so sorry.

47:50.768 --> 47:53.836
I just wanted to keep you guys
from talking about politics.

47:54.806 --> 47:57.473
Look, you only met my dad once.

47:58.810 --> 48:01.644
And he really is a very kind
man.

48:03.281 --> 48:06.282
- We are enemies
in politics, Kate.

48:06.284 --> 48:08.417
- But we're a family now.

48:09.888 --> 48:11.520
We can talk and,

48:11.522 --> 48:13.823
be kind to each other.

48:13.825 --> 48:17.059
- We'll be family
when my ass heals.

48:17.061 --> 48:18.661
I'm sorry.

48:18.663 --> 48:20.529
- Right, no, of course.

48:20.531 --> 48:22.999
I'll just leave you to it.

48:23.001 --> 48:25.701
(stomach gurgling)

48:25.703 --> 48:26.602
Good talk.

48:29.407 --> 48:30.873
- Very good talk.

48:31.776 --> 48:33.075
Very good talk.

48:34.812 --> 48:36.312
- [Man] An annual metro girl,

48:36.314 --> 48:38.281
- Yes, yes, that's him!

48:39.817 --> 48:41.050
My god.

48:41.052 --> 48:41.951
Oh my god.

48:43.922 --> 48:45.388
How did he ever
enter the country?

48:45.390 --> 48:47.323
What was the FBI thinking?

48:47.325 --> 48:48.357
- They weren't hard
on him because of your

48:48.359 --> 48:51.961
official letter of
invitation, yours.

48:51.963 --> 48:53.863
Chikhamvari is one
of the most notorious

48:53.865 --> 48:55.564
anti-Americans in Iran.

48:55.566 --> 48:58.634
He's been involved in numerous
anti-American protests.

48:58.636 --> 49:00.770
He's against the joint
comprehensive plan of action.

49:00.772 --> 49:02.038
Hell, he's even been rumored

49:02.040 --> 49:03.973
to be in touch with Ahmadinejad.

49:03.975 --> 49:05.608
- Oh, I'm ruined!

49:05.610 --> 49:07.643
- That will destroy
your career in Congress,

49:07.645 --> 49:09.195
that's for sure.

49:09.196 --> 49:10.746
- Hey, let me tell you
something. This is a conspiracy.

49:10.748 --> 49:14.216
It's a definite political setup.

49:14.218 --> 49:17.853
No, no, my adversaries
intentionally did this,

49:17.855 --> 49:18.888
let him into the country

49:18.890 --> 49:21.390
to blame me and eliminate me.

49:27.532 --> 49:29.765
(sighing)

49:29.767 --> 49:30.833
- I'm bored.

49:32.503 --> 49:36.572
- Nothing that I can do to
change that.

49:36.574 --> 49:38.474
What are you gonna do?

49:38.476 --> 49:39.475
- What am I gonna do,

49:39.477 --> 49:41.077
a fucking reporter
could be looking at this

49:41.079 --> 49:42.044
at any moment.

49:42.046 --> 49:43.145
You know how the media is.

49:43.147 --> 49:44.146
We gotta keep it down low.

49:44.148 --> 49:45.181
- That's why you gotta do
something now.

49:45.183 --> 49:46.415
- All right, I'll get
in front of it.

49:46.417 --> 49:48.451
- We've got to get him
out of the country.

49:48.453 --> 49:49.452
- Okay great.

49:49.454 --> 49:51.420
- Minimal amount of fuss,
all right.

49:51.422 --> 49:54.256
And we don't want anybody
knowing about this.

49:54.258 --> 49:55.658
Especially Saul.

49:56.594 --> 49:57.493
- Jesus.

50:03.067 --> 50:05.301
(sighing)

50:11.242 --> 50:14.377
- Americans just took
my bone marrow.

50:16.881 --> 50:18.547
Oh, it hurts a lot.

50:19.450 --> 50:21.751
In the back and in the ass.

50:24.055 --> 50:27.757
And now I am meeting
with a veteran Joe.

50:27.759 --> 50:29.225
We'll see.

50:29.227 --> 50:30.359
Over and out.

50:34.499 --> 50:35.398
Hey!

50:36.768 --> 50:37.666
Great!

50:39.337 --> 50:40.403
- Come on, you're late.

50:40.405 --> 50:41.303
Let's go.

50:43.274 --> 50:45.841
(funky music)

50:49.781 --> 50:52.581
(truck starting)

50:54.352 --> 50:56.485
You are so lucky you've
met me, my man.

50:56.487 --> 51:00.056
I know this town like
the back of my hand.

51:06.130 --> 51:07.196
- What the fuck is this?

51:07.198 --> 51:09.265
- Hah, that's nothing, man.

51:09.267 --> 51:10.499
- This is a bomb!

51:10.501 --> 51:12.001
- No it's not.

51:12.003 --> 51:14.437
You know what, buddy, Habib,

51:14.439 --> 51:18.374
in this country, we say
the word bomb quietly.

51:18.376 --> 51:20.476
People don't shout it.

51:20.478 --> 51:22.211
Specially people
who look like you.

51:22.213 --> 51:23.546
All right, do you feel me?

51:23.548 --> 51:25.748
But just sit back, relax.

51:25.750 --> 51:27.249
Enjoy the breeze!

51:28.019 --> 51:30.386
¶ Love has grown
this bumpy room ¶

51:30.388 --> 51:33.022
¶ But we still got room to fly ¶

51:33.024 --> 51:35.524
- I don't trust this Joe,
I don't know.

51:35.526 --> 51:37.793
Something is so fishy about him.

51:37.795 --> 51:39.695
Over and out.

51:39.697 --> 51:40.930
- Check it out.

51:40.932 --> 51:43.499
Twin towers, man, whoosh, brr!

51:44.902 --> 51:45.901
- Thank you.

51:45.903 --> 51:47.870
- I gotta show you something.
(laughing)

51:47.872 --> 51:49.839
You are gonna
love this shit, man.

51:49.841 --> 51:53.576
This is a scene to
remember of all scenes.

51:53.578 --> 51:54.777
Remember this?

51:54.779 --> 51:56.912
First plane,
comes around the side

51:56.914 --> 51:58.747
of the tower there, right, poof!

51:58.749 --> 52:01.650
Right, then the second one.

52:01.652 --> 52:03.018
- Wow.

52:03.020 --> 52:04.587
I have a question.

52:05.423 --> 52:08.757
Is it true that this was
all just an American plot

52:08.759 --> 52:10.693
to invade the middle east?

52:10.695 --> 52:13.462
I mean what do you
Americans think?

52:13.464 --> 52:14.697
- Yeah, right?

52:16.100 --> 52:17.399
Definitely.

52:17.401 --> 52:18.934
Dammit you're right.

52:18.936 --> 52:21.470
I saw it, I saw it on the
internet, man.

52:21.472 --> 52:23.072
- But, but, but.

52:23.073 --> 52:24.673
- Fire doesn't burn through
steel, my man.

52:24.675 --> 52:25.975
- Exactly.

52:25.977 --> 52:28.844
But why would the government
harm its own people?

52:28.846 --> 52:30.246
- You can tell me.

52:30.248 --> 52:31.413
- You are American, you tell me.

52:31.415 --> 52:33.682
- They're not gonna
tell me shit, man.

52:33.684 --> 52:36.919
But I got a way to
make them, one day.

52:41.092 --> 52:42.391
- It makes sense.

52:42.393 --> 52:45.461
They don't let the media
publish such things.

52:45.463 --> 52:46.462
- The engineering part

52:46.464 --> 52:49.331
of the operation was
mind-blowing, man.

52:49.333 --> 52:50.966
It's a masterpiece.

52:52.703 --> 52:54.737
They made it seem so real.

52:54.739 --> 52:56.639
- But this is painful.

52:57.441 --> 52:59.842
(screeching)

52:59.844 --> 53:01.544
- Why do you say that, man?

53:01.546 --> 53:03.846
- Because there were some
innocent people after all.

53:03.848 --> 53:05.414
Like the Afghans.

53:05.416 --> 53:07.283
I mean there's no difference.

53:07.285 --> 53:08.751
Terror is bad.

53:08.753 --> 53:09.985
- Okay, okay.

53:09.987 --> 53:10.886
I'm gonna,

53:13.524 --> 53:14.407
- What?

53:14.408 --> 53:15.291
- I'm gonna tell
you something, man.

53:15.293 --> 53:16.192
- Uh huh.

53:20.064 --> 53:23.065
- I got a plan to
make it all real.

53:23.901 --> 53:26.635
I got a plan to make people see.

53:27.438 --> 53:28.270
Watch this.

53:28.272 --> 53:29.104
- What?

53:29.106 --> 53:29.939
- You're gonna love this.

53:29.941 --> 53:30.873
You seen this movie?

53:33.211 --> 53:35.311
Look at that.

53:35.312 --> 53:37.412
I wanna do that same thing
right here in Los Angeles.

53:37.415 --> 53:39.882
- No, Joe, this is not good.

53:39.884 --> 53:42.117
This is, no, no, no!

53:42.119 --> 53:46.155
I mean look, I have fought
with America all my life.

53:46.157 --> 53:47.590
But this is different.

53:47.592 --> 53:49.525
This is killing the people.

53:49.527 --> 53:50.726
People are innocent.

53:50.728 --> 53:53.996
I agree with you, the
American government is guilty.

53:53.998 --> 53:55.798
But why do you even
have all these videos

53:55.800 --> 53:56.966
on your phone?

53:56.968 --> 53:59.034
- What the fuck do you
think you are, huh?

53:59.036 --> 54:00.302
I thought you would understand.

54:00.304 --> 54:03.472
You don't understand shit,
huh, who are you, huh?

54:03.474 --> 54:04.573
What do you want from us, huh?

54:04.575 --> 54:07.243
You, why do you think
people are innocent huh?

54:07.245 --> 54:08.677
They are all to blame.

54:08.679 --> 54:10.746
They, they, they,
they, they, they.

54:10.748 --> 54:11.747
They pay tax,

54:11.749 --> 54:12.881
they worship the president.

54:12.883 --> 54:14.550
They encourage me to go to war

54:14.552 --> 54:15.651
and risk my life for what huh?

54:15.653 --> 54:16.885
Who the hell do you
think you are?

54:16.887 --> 54:18.520
What do you want from us huh?

54:18.522 --> 54:19.622
Maybe I should blow
your fucking head off

54:19.624 --> 54:20.623
right here now, huh?

54:20.625 --> 54:22.224
- Wait, Joe, my friend.

54:22.226 --> 54:23.926
You are acting crazy.

54:23.928 --> 54:25.361
- Crazy, yeah.

54:25.363 --> 54:26.395
Yeah I'm crazy.

54:26.397 --> 54:28.864
Yeah, they, we are all crazy.

54:31.535 --> 54:33.469
I thought you'd understand.

54:33.471 --> 54:36.472
I trusted you man,
you stupid jerk.

54:37.375 --> 54:38.274
Ah, dack.

54:40.711 --> 54:42.177
I'm sorry.

54:42.179 --> 54:44.113
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, sorry,
sorry, sorry,

54:44.115 --> 54:45.180
sorry, come on.

54:45.182 --> 54:46.582
You stupid jerk, let's go,

54:46.584 --> 54:48.284
I wanna show you
this beautiful city.

54:48.286 --> 54:49.285
Come on.

54:49.287 --> 54:50.185
Let's go.

55:05.369 --> 55:07.436
(doorbell ringing)

55:07.438 --> 55:09.405
(knocking)

55:09.407 --> 55:12.374
(doorbell ringing)

55:24.622 --> 55:25.721
(doorbell ringing)

55:25.723 --> 55:27.790
- Hey, Prince of Persia.

55:29.460 --> 55:31.493
They ain't home.

55:31.495 --> 55:32.995
You okay?

55:32.997 --> 55:34.697
- [Hamid] Hide me please.

55:34.699 --> 55:37.299
There is a mad man after me.

55:37.301 --> 55:40.369
- (chuckling) Well,
welcome to America.

55:40.371 --> 55:41.970
Come on, come on.

55:41.972 --> 55:44.206
I'll meet you in the back.

55:46.577 --> 55:47.910
Coffee?

55:47.912 --> 55:49.311
Anything you'd like?

55:49.313 --> 55:54.116
Oh, how about some of this?
(laughing)

55:54.118 --> 55:57.353
- No thank you, I don't do those
things.

55:57.355 --> 56:02.358
- Well, it's your loss.
(laughing)

56:02.360 --> 56:05.494
(coughing) Yeah, you keep
coughing huh.

56:05.496 --> 56:09.298
You keep coughing,
you keep feeling.

56:09.300 --> 56:12.368
Ooh! (laughing)

56:12.370 --> 56:13.535
Did you see that?

56:13.537 --> 56:15.270
Did you see that there?

56:15.272 --> 56:16.939
- Why is this funny?

56:16.941 --> 56:17.840
- Why?

56:20.010 --> 56:23.912
Because he got kicked
in the balls by his kid.

56:25.649 --> 56:27.983
And he's not supposed
to do that.

56:27.985 --> 56:30.052
Over here, I don't know.

56:31.122 --> 56:33.856
(kids shouting)

56:37.862 --> 56:38.894
- Um, Hamid?

56:42.466 --> 56:44.166
Excuse me, Hamid.

56:44.168 --> 56:45.167
- Oh, oh, oh.

56:45.169 --> 56:46.869
- Hi, I'm so sorry,
we weren't home.

56:46.871 --> 56:47.970
- Come come, sit down.

56:47.972 --> 56:49.238
- Do you mind?

56:49.240 --> 56:50.205
If we talk?
- Sit down.

56:50.207 --> 56:51.039
- Great.

56:51.041 --> 56:52.007
- Of course not.

56:52.009 --> 56:52.908
- Okay.

56:55.546 --> 56:57.012
My father called.

56:58.015 --> 57:01.550
He apologized for his
behavior last night.

57:01.552 --> 57:02.718
- Are you kidding?

57:02.720 --> 57:04.453
He really did that?

57:04.455 --> 57:05.888
- Yes, yeah.

57:05.890 --> 57:10.092
I mean he wanted me to
apologize on his behalf.

57:10.094 --> 57:13.395
- Well, this is the
right things to do.

57:16.133 --> 57:19.868
See, if America apologizes
for its behavior,

57:20.738 --> 57:24.973
we would establish good
relations, don't doubt it.

57:26.877 --> 57:30.045
But let me tell you something.

57:30.047 --> 57:33.148
My behavior wasn't right either.

57:33.150 --> 57:38.220
Actually, I haven't seen an
American politician closely.

57:38.622 --> 57:39.621
I panicked.

57:41.425 --> 57:43.992
- Well, I will tell
him you said that.

57:43.994 --> 57:44.893
- No!

57:47.431 --> 57:48.831
I mean, not yet.

57:50.701 --> 57:51.667
- Okay, um.

57:51.669 --> 57:56.505
Look, how about we have
another family dinner?

58:01.879 --> 58:04.146
I hope everyone enjoys
this gourmet dinner.

58:04.148 --> 58:07.049
- [Ben] It looks great, honey.
- [Kate] It looks great.

58:11.922 --> 58:14.223
(clinking)

58:17.828 --> 58:19.895
(clearing throat)

58:19.897 --> 58:24.700
- Whatever has happened that
brought us together is done.

58:27.338 --> 58:29.471
And there's nothing that
any one of us can do

58:29.473 --> 58:31.139
to change that now.

58:32.176 --> 58:36.812
So I highly suggest that we
focus on a common happiness

58:38.315 --> 58:39.948
which is the twins.

58:39.950 --> 58:40.916
- One baby.

58:43.420 --> 58:44.419
- One baby?

58:44.421 --> 58:46.255
What about the twins?

58:47.725 --> 58:52.060
- I say that there must
be a time when a new baby

58:52.062 --> 58:54.162
is going to be born.

58:54.164 --> 58:56.932
He must be born
with peace of mind

58:56.934 --> 59:00.335
and to be assured, no
matter in what country

59:00.337 --> 59:03.872
he opens his eyes,
he must find happiness.

59:05.309 --> 59:07.309
And this is our firstborn!

59:07.311 --> 59:11.280
(clapping and laughing)

59:11.282 --> 59:14.950
- Dad, why don't you
take Hamid to the beach?

59:14.952 --> 59:16.418
- No beaches, no.

59:17.721 --> 59:20.522
- It's okay, we can do
something different.

59:20.524 --> 59:23.158
I have something in mind,
it's a historical venue

59:23.160 --> 59:25.327
and I think you'll
get a kick out of it.

59:25.329 --> 59:27.796
I think you'll like it.

59:27.798 --> 59:31.066
- [Ben] As they say, maybe
the second time was the charm.

59:31.068 --> 59:34.937
But you won't believe what
happens next.

59:34.939 --> 59:37.506
(light music)

59:44.748 --> 59:46.214
- [Hamid] Well thank you,
TJ, I really appreciate you

59:46.216 --> 59:47.883
taking me out
of the house today.

59:47.885 --> 59:49.117
- Ah, no problem.

59:49.119 --> 59:51.420
I thought you'd enjoy
this, a bit different.

59:51.422 --> 59:52.421
- Another spy.

59:52.423 --> 59:53.956
- Ah, that's Hector.

59:53.958 --> 59:55.223
Don't worry about him.

59:55.225 --> 59:58.794
He's our photographer, our
campaign clown.

01:00:00.898 --> 01:00:01.997
He thinks he's Peter Pan.

01:00:01.999 --> 01:00:03.632
(laughing)

01:00:03.634 --> 01:00:04.800
- Okay, okay.

01:00:06.403 --> 01:00:08.837
(camera clicking)

01:00:08.839 --> 01:00:10.739
What a beautiful ship.

01:00:11.775 --> 01:00:14.176
How sad it was used for war.

01:00:15.245 --> 01:00:16.645
- Yeah, I agree.

01:00:23.721 --> 01:00:27.456
- We have many reasons
not to trust America.

01:00:28.626 --> 01:00:32.127
- That works both ways, my
friend.

01:00:32.129 --> 01:00:35.364
- If every time, every
time we extended our hand

01:00:35.366 --> 01:00:39.735
for friendship, either you
smack it or you trick us.

01:00:41.639 --> 01:00:46.708
- Hamid, please, let's not start
another political argument.

01:00:46.844 --> 01:00:48.143
I mean if we're gonna be
friends,

01:00:48.145 --> 01:00:49.878
I mean we're family now, right?

01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:53.582
No matter how we feel about
things, okay?

01:00:53.584 --> 01:00:57.085
So let's not give in to those
things that

01:00:59.923 --> 01:01:01.657
create animosities, you know?

01:01:01.659 --> 01:01:03.659
Who benefits from that?

01:01:04.762 --> 01:01:06.128
- Okay.

01:01:06.130 --> 01:01:07.362
Good question.

01:01:11.702 --> 01:01:14.736
- That is a good question,
answer it.

01:01:14.738 --> 01:01:16.004
- I know the answer.

01:01:16.006 --> 01:01:18.407
I need to know your opinion.

01:01:22.479 --> 01:01:25.180
- I don't have an opinion.

01:01:25.182 --> 01:01:26.648
- I think you do.

01:01:27.651 --> 01:01:29.484
I think you do, stop kidding.

01:01:29.486 --> 01:01:33.789
You know very well who
benefits from our animosity.

01:01:35.659 --> 01:01:36.558
What?

01:01:38.529 --> 01:01:39.594
Is that Joe?

01:01:40.964 --> 01:01:41.930
- Who's that?

01:01:41.932 --> 01:01:42.931
- That guy.

01:01:43.801 --> 01:01:44.533
Hey, Joe.

01:01:47.705 --> 01:01:48.603
Joe!

01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:52.441
Is he following me?

01:01:52.443 --> 01:01:53.442
- [Tucker] That's a
pretty creepy looking guy.

01:01:53.444 --> 01:01:54.876
How do you know him?

01:01:54.878 --> 01:01:55.944
- I met him.

01:01:56.747 --> 01:01:58.780
I mean he is a strange
character.

01:01:58.782 --> 01:02:01.316
I met him when I was exploring
the city.

01:02:01.318 --> 01:02:03.485
He's, he's kind of crazy.

01:02:04.655 --> 01:02:08.657
He has this fantasy of blowing
up a bomb

01:02:08.659 --> 01:02:13.729
in a crowded area in
Los Angeles. (laughing)

01:02:16.033 --> 01:02:16.932
What?

01:02:20.270 --> 01:02:21.937
TJ, he's a crazy guy,

01:02:21.939 --> 01:02:24.072
he's a very dangerous guy.

01:02:24.074 --> 01:02:25.874
Is he going to do it?

01:02:27.277 --> 01:02:28.176
Joe!

01:02:29.213 --> 01:02:30.245
Joe!

01:02:30.247 --> 01:02:31.813
Joe, he has a bomb!

01:02:31.815 --> 01:02:32.714
Wait!

01:02:34.818 --> 01:02:35.817
- Gerald, Gerald, Gerald,

01:02:35.819 --> 01:02:36.818
there's a bomb!

01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:38.420
Call 911, the police!

01:02:38.422 --> 01:02:40.155
- Hey, where you going?

01:02:40.157 --> 01:02:42.724
(tense music)

01:02:46.497 --> 01:02:48.697
(rotor whirring)

01:02:48.699 --> 01:02:50.565
- [Man On Radio] We've
got a possible bomb threat

01:02:50.567 --> 01:02:52.868
assume there by the harbor.

01:02:53.804 --> 01:02:55.704
I'm heading there now.

01:03:00.077 --> 01:03:03.345
(tense music)

01:03:03.347 --> 01:03:04.179
- Come on.

01:03:04.181 --> 01:03:06.515
Gotta get your message out.

01:03:11.789 --> 01:03:14.623
(siren sounding)

01:03:15.859 --> 01:03:18.860
(tires screeching)

01:03:29.006 --> 01:03:30.238
(farting)

01:04:09.146 --> 01:04:10.612
- Joe, Joe, wait!

01:04:11.448 --> 01:04:12.347
Wait!

01:04:16.186 --> 01:04:17.185
- [Man On Radio] We have two
subjects

01:04:17.187 --> 01:04:19.454
entering the top deck
of the battleship.

01:04:19.456 --> 01:04:21.122
They possibly have
a bomb on them.

01:04:21.124 --> 01:04:22.958
Proceed with caution.

01:04:24.127 --> 01:04:25.627
- [Hamid] No, no!

01:04:26.496 --> 01:04:30.332
Joe, in this ship, these
are innocent people!

01:04:31.568 --> 01:04:33.034
- You don't understand!

01:04:33.036 --> 01:04:35.570
I am trying, trying
to save the world!

01:04:35.572 --> 01:04:36.905
- Hamid!

01:04:36.907 --> 01:04:38.440
Are you okay?

01:04:38.442 --> 01:04:41.243
- I'm good, don't worry.

01:04:41.245 --> 01:04:42.744
- [Man On Loudspeaker] This is
the police.

01:04:42.746 --> 01:04:44.679
You're surrounded.

01:04:44.681 --> 01:04:47.983
(tense music)

01:04:47.985 --> 01:04:50.719
(clock beeping)

01:04:54.391 --> 01:04:56.958
(crowd gasping)

01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:59.194
(booming)

01:05:00.163 --> 01:05:02.898
(siren blaring)

01:05:03.934 --> 01:05:05.734
(revving)

01:05:05.736 --> 01:05:08.703
(tires screeching)

01:05:12.009 --> 01:05:14.242
- [Joe] You ruined everything!

01:05:14.244 --> 01:05:15.477
- I saved you!

01:05:16.914 --> 01:05:18.647
I saved your people!

01:05:21.385 --> 01:05:22.484
- [Ben] Who would have thought,

01:05:22.486 --> 01:05:24.653
my dad, an American hero.

01:05:27.090 --> 01:05:31.493
Don't worry, he's sure
gonna let everyone know.

01:05:31.495 --> 01:05:32.928
- Enjoy your life as a
great American patriot!

01:05:32.930 --> 01:05:37.299
(shouting over each other)

01:05:37.301 --> 01:05:38.500
- Fuck you!

01:05:38.502 --> 01:05:40.835
Fuck you, fuck you,
fuck you, fuck you!

01:05:40.837 --> 01:05:42.337
(cameras clicking)

01:05:42.339 --> 01:05:45.040
- It was my humane
duty to do this.

01:05:45.042 --> 01:05:47.342
Maybe who knows,
maybe it was God's will

01:05:47.344 --> 01:05:49.811
that I take this trip and
come to save the lives

01:05:49.813 --> 01:05:52.147
of these innocent people.

01:05:52.149 --> 01:05:53.415
- That's right.

01:05:53.417 --> 01:05:55.483
And my family has and always
will protect

01:05:55.485 --> 01:05:59.287
the innocent, and I am very
very proud of my brother.

01:05:59.289 --> 01:06:01.323
- I am a political activist.

01:06:01.325 --> 01:06:05.994
And people in Iran know
me as anti-Imperialist.

01:06:05.996 --> 01:06:06.828
I am a true--

01:06:06.830 --> 01:06:09.230
- And he is my guest.

01:06:09.232 --> 01:06:12.100
And I am Tucker,
Tucker Jefferson.

01:06:13.236 --> 01:06:15.904
- And I am Tucker Jefferson's
security consultant, Gerald.

01:06:15.906 --> 01:06:17.656
- Out, detective, out.

01:06:17.657 --> 01:06:19.407
- This is Vincent Van
Hinden with WCPZ news,

01:06:19.409 --> 01:06:20.442
back to you Greg.

01:06:20.444 --> 01:06:23.345
(phone vibrating)

01:06:24.614 --> 01:06:25.513
- Hey.

01:06:28.452 --> 01:06:29.351
Hello?

01:06:31.221 --> 01:06:32.120
Huh?

01:06:33.623 --> 01:06:34.522
Kate?

01:06:35.425 --> 01:06:39.361
(instruments beeping)

01:06:39.363 --> 01:06:42.497
(ventilator hissing)

01:06:47.304 --> 01:06:48.536
- I like this.

01:06:50.907 --> 01:06:52.474
Look at that, huh?

01:06:53.844 --> 01:06:56.177
That looks actually pretty good.

01:06:56.179 --> 01:06:57.645
I'm happy so far.

01:06:59.116 --> 01:07:00.181
I bet he is.

01:07:09.359 --> 01:07:13.361
(siren sounding in background)

01:07:31.314 --> 01:07:33.548
- [Woman] Dr. Valentino,
to the OR please.

01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:35.683
Dr. Valentino, to the OR please.

01:07:35.685 --> 01:07:37.352
- This can be nothing
but stress.

01:07:37.354 --> 01:07:39.054
We don't need it now.

01:07:39.056 --> 01:07:41.389
- Yeah, you got that right.

01:07:45.529 --> 01:07:48.430
- What are you
thinking about, TJ?

01:07:51.134 --> 01:07:54.169
- Ah, I was just thinking about

01:07:54.171 --> 01:07:56.337
what a great thing you
did out there today.

01:07:56.339 --> 01:07:58.306
It was very impressive.

01:08:00.010 --> 01:08:02.243
And I'm glad you're
part of the family.

01:08:02.245 --> 01:08:03.311
- Thank you.

01:08:04.514 --> 01:08:05.580
- Excuse me.

01:08:13.990 --> 01:08:16.390
What, is it too bad?

01:08:16.393 --> 01:08:21.196
- Benjamin says that Kate's
situation is not normal.

01:08:21.198 --> 01:08:23.531
- What do you mean not normal?

01:08:23.533 --> 01:08:26.701
- Because the doctor says it's
50-50.

01:08:26.703 --> 01:08:28.636
Hamid, I'm sorry.

01:08:28.638 --> 01:08:32.907
- My darling, 50-50 is better
chance that we ever have.

01:08:32.908 --> 01:08:34.142
It'll be okay.

01:08:35.145 --> 01:08:37.145
Leave it in God's hands.

01:08:37.147 --> 01:08:38.212
Don't worry.

01:08:40.716 --> 01:08:42.850
- An anonymous source
has drawn our attention

01:08:42.853 --> 01:08:44.819
to an interesting point.

01:08:44.821 --> 01:08:47.388
This is a photo from 1980

01:08:47.390 --> 01:08:49.057
when Iranian students stormed

01:08:49.059 --> 01:08:51.059
the American embassy in Tehran.

01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:53.094
In this photo is non other

01:08:53.095 --> 01:08:55.229
than Mr. Hamid Chikhamvari

01:08:55.232 --> 01:08:57.499
with clenched fists of anger.

01:08:57.501 --> 01:09:00.902
How he got a visa and came to
the US is being investigated.

01:09:00.904 --> 01:09:02.437
But it seems he entered American
soil

01:09:02.439 --> 01:09:04.839
with the official support and
invitation

01:09:04.841 --> 01:09:06.875
of Mr. Tucker Jefferson.

01:09:07.911 --> 01:09:11.513
I just interviewed Mr.
Chikhamvari recently.

01:09:11.515 --> 01:09:14.314
Hear his puzzling interview
next.

01:09:15.752 --> 01:09:18.752
- [Hamid] There are no mortal
enemies.

01:09:18.755 --> 01:09:22.223
There are only manufactured
enemies

01:09:22.225 --> 01:09:24.959
that serve for specific purpose.

01:09:25.828 --> 01:09:27.395
- [Christiana] Iran and the US,

01:09:27.397 --> 01:09:30.198
two enemies, former friends,
lobbying

01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:32.867
media attacks at each
other almost every day.

01:09:32.868 --> 01:09:34.234
(phone vibrating)

01:09:34.237 --> 01:09:36.237
When will it stop? Do you
think it will ever end?

01:09:36.238 --> 01:09:37.305
- Saul?

01:09:37.307 --> 01:09:40.908
- Are you watching the fucking
television?

01:09:40.911 --> 01:09:43.511
What have you done, Tucker
Jefferson?

01:09:43.513 --> 01:09:44.912
- I can explain.

01:09:46.116 --> 01:09:48.049
- Oh you can explain, huh?

01:09:48.051 --> 01:09:49.050
What a mess, you're never gonna
get

01:09:49.051 --> 01:09:51.352
the evangelical vote this way.

01:09:51.354 --> 01:09:53.755
You're gonna be reduced to a bit
player!

01:09:53.756 --> 01:09:55.757
Come on, it's too controversial.

01:09:55.759 --> 01:09:58.193
- Please, Saul, I can't talk
right now.

01:09:58.195 --> 01:10:00.428
I will explain later.

01:10:00.430 --> 01:10:01.896
- You don't have time.

01:10:01.898 --> 01:10:04.299
You don't have time for me?!

01:10:05.502 --> 01:10:06.801
Son of a bitch.

01:10:11.174 --> 01:10:13.808
- It's a mind game.

01:10:13.809 --> 01:10:16.443
I'm gonna torture him and
then I'm gonna kill him.

01:10:18.181 --> 01:10:19.948
I very consciously want to.

01:10:19.950 --> 01:10:22.250
- Mr. President, please
calm down, all right?

01:10:22.252 --> 01:10:23.985
I'm still not even sure.

01:10:23.987 --> 01:10:25.537
- [Biden] What does that mean?

01:10:25.538 --> 01:10:27.088
Do you understand, can you
articulate why you can't?

01:10:27.090 --> 01:10:28.489
- It's gonna be fine.

01:10:28.491 --> 01:10:29.691
You gotta trust me, all right?

01:10:29.693 --> 01:10:31.092
- [Biden] We're not having
this conversation. (beeping)

01:10:31.094 --> 01:10:33.962
- Please, you have to understand
this,

01:10:33.964 --> 01:10:35.196
Mr. President?

01:10:40.670 --> 01:10:43.738
(breathing heavily)

01:11:17.641 --> 01:11:18.640
(slapping)

01:11:18.642 --> 01:11:20.942
- Fucking crazy motherfucker!

01:11:20.944 --> 01:11:22.176
You ruined me!

01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:24.279
- What is the matter?

01:11:24.281 --> 01:11:26.414
I thought we were family.

01:11:27.317 --> 01:11:30.418
- Who paid you to come
here and destroy me?

01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:32.387
- What's wrong with you?

01:11:32.389 --> 01:11:34.289
Calm down, brother.

01:11:34.291 --> 01:11:35.456
- Oh no, don't call me brother.

01:11:35.458 --> 01:11:36.457
Don't call me brother.

01:11:36.459 --> 01:11:38.760
Where were you 40 years ago?

01:11:38.762 --> 01:11:40.561
- You mean January 40 years ago,

01:11:40.563 --> 01:11:42.864
or 40 years ago now?

01:11:42.866 --> 01:11:44.832
I don't even remember
what I had for breakfast!

01:11:44.834 --> 01:11:46.134
- You,

01:11:46.136 --> 01:11:47.568
- Eggs and turkey bacon!

01:11:47.570 --> 01:11:48.569
- What?

01:11:48.571 --> 01:11:50.571
- I remember what I had for
breakfast.

01:11:50.573 --> 01:11:52.140
- You were one of the students

01:11:52.142 --> 01:11:56.311
that occupied the American
embassy in Tehran in 1980!

01:11:56.313 --> 01:11:57.745
- Oh that?

01:11:57.747 --> 01:11:58.746
- Yeah, that!

01:11:58.748 --> 01:11:59.981
You know, you're the one that's
a spy.

01:11:59.983 --> 01:12:01.582
You were hired to come here

01:12:01.584 --> 01:12:02.750
and drag me through the mud.

01:12:02.752 --> 01:12:03.885
Yeah.

01:12:03.887 --> 01:12:06.487
- I've come here for bone
marrow,

01:12:06.489 --> 01:12:08.289
you stupid old man.

01:12:08.291 --> 01:12:10.958
I saved your people when
you did absolutely nothing.

01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:11.959
- I don't believe you!

01:12:11.961 --> 01:12:13.227
- This is just crazy talk!

01:12:13.229 --> 01:12:14.629
- That's enough!

01:12:17.734 --> 01:12:19.200
My wife is dying.

01:12:22.238 --> 01:12:25.306
Is there nothing sacred for you
two?

01:12:31.281 --> 01:12:33.381
(somber guitar music)

01:12:33.383 --> 01:12:37.085
(instruments beeping)

01:12:37.087 --> 01:12:39.220
¶ Will the train pass me by ¶

01:12:39.222 --> 01:12:40.088
- Stable?

01:12:42.792 --> 01:12:43.791
How does it look?

01:12:43.793 --> 01:12:45.126
- [Nurse] Good.

01:12:49.566 --> 01:12:52.100
- That look good to you?

01:12:52.102 --> 01:12:53.101
Good to me.

01:12:56.239 --> 01:12:59.307
¶ Behind the silver ¶

01:13:02.846 --> 01:13:05.413
(baby crying)

01:13:07.183 --> 01:13:10.918
- [Doctor] Check those
levels for me please.

01:13:12.422 --> 01:13:13.921
- [Nurse] Doctor.

01:13:15.225 --> 01:13:16.057
- Oh god, the mom is dropping.

01:13:16.059 --> 01:13:17.158
Call the Tac team right now.

01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:20.695
Open up the IV's right now,
we need more.

01:13:20.697 --> 01:13:23.331
¶ I can't stay here no more ¶

01:13:23.333 --> 01:13:25.900
- [Hamid] Hey, it's me, Hamid.

01:13:27.971 --> 01:13:29.737
I'm going to take over now

01:13:29.739 --> 01:13:32.306
because my son, God bless him,

01:13:34.677 --> 01:13:35.977
is so dramatic.

01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:39.480
He's nothing like me.

01:13:41.751 --> 01:13:46.921
You don't have to thank me,
but you're welcome again.

01:13:46.923 --> 01:13:49.924
Nothing is permanent
in this world.

01:13:50.727 --> 01:13:52.627
Not even our troubles.

01:13:53.696 --> 01:13:56.931
It doesn't really matter
your race, religion,

01:13:56.933 --> 01:13:59.100
or national origin.

01:13:59.102 --> 01:14:00.568
We're all humans.

01:14:04.741 --> 01:14:06.307
And love is human.

01:14:13.650 --> 01:14:16.217
(light music)

01:14:25.895 --> 01:14:27.662
- You doing your homework,
sweetie?

01:14:27.664 --> 01:14:28.663
- Yeah.

01:14:28.665 --> 01:14:29.964
- I brought your favorite juice.

01:14:29.966 --> 01:14:31.032
- Thank you.

01:14:36.906 --> 01:14:39.874
- Let me know if you need
anything.

01:14:59.729 --> 01:15:02.396
- [Christina] Here's my
interview with Tucker Jefferson

01:15:02.398 --> 01:15:04.165
from this morning.

01:15:04.167 --> 01:15:06.434
- I think the American
people want to know the truth

01:15:06.436 --> 01:15:08.269
of what's happening in the
world.

01:15:08.271 --> 01:15:09.904
- If you can sum up the truth

01:15:09.906 --> 01:15:14.675
in one word for us, Mr.
President, what would it be?

01:15:14.677 --> 01:15:17.445
- That's a tough one, Christina.

01:15:17.447 --> 01:15:20.381
But the policy of American
government

01:15:20.383 --> 01:15:22.783
is focused on family values.

01:15:24.354 --> 01:15:26.988
And I hope that
when a child is born,

01:15:26.990 --> 01:15:28.389
no matter where in the world,

01:15:28.391 --> 01:15:32.059
when he opens his eyes
he has peace of mind,

01:15:32.061 --> 01:15:34.962
and his goal is to find
happiness,

01:15:36.566 --> 01:15:38.399
I believe everybody in
the world wants that.

01:15:38.401 --> 01:15:41.235
- Thank you so much for
joining me this morning,

01:15:41.237 --> 01:15:42.136
Mr. President.

01:15:42.138 --> 01:15:44.038
- Thank you everybody.

01:15:45.675 --> 01:15:49.877
- In line with the policy of
focusing on nation and family,

01:15:49.879 --> 01:15:52.580
President Tucker Jefferson
announced his imminent

01:15:52.582 --> 01:15:54.282
travel to Iran.

01:15:54.284 --> 01:15:58.519
After freeing Iran's assets
and lifting sanctions,

01:15:58.521 --> 01:16:00.688
President Tucker Jefferson
took big steps

01:16:00.690 --> 01:16:02.657
to reconcile with Iran.

01:16:03.993 --> 01:16:06.894
And this trip can be the
beginning of a new era

01:16:06.896 --> 01:16:08.930
in relations with Iran

01:16:08.932 --> 01:16:11.399
and generally throughout the
middle east.

01:16:11.401 --> 01:16:13.701
With a policy that was
welcomed tremendously

01:16:13.703 --> 01:16:16.704
by the American and
Iranian nation.

01:16:20.810 --> 01:16:23.978
(light guitar music)

01:16:28.551 --> 01:16:32.286
¶ Will the train pass me by ¶

01:16:38.928 --> 01:16:43.998
¶ As I wander in the night ¶

01:16:48.705 --> 01:16:53.441
¶ Behind the silver line ¶

01:16:53.443 --> 01:16:56.344
¶ Of our memories ¶

01:17:06.089 --> 01:17:10.191
¶ And it's time to
just admit it ¶

01:17:10.193 --> 01:17:11.692
¶ Ooh ¶

01:17:11.694 --> 01:17:16.731
¶ I can't stay here no more ¶

01:17:18.968 --> 01:17:23.170
¶ No more ¶

01:17:23.172 --> 01:17:28.209
¶ 'Cause there's nothing
holding me down here now ¶

01:17:30.146 --> 01:17:33.814
¶ We faded into the clouds ¶

01:17:42.659 --> 01:17:46.360
¶ If the train passes me by ¶

01:17:52.702 --> 01:17:57.772
¶ At least they'll
know that I tried ¶

01:18:02.045 --> 01:18:06.047
¶ Every time that I hear it ¶

01:18:06.049 --> 01:18:08.783
¶ Ooh ¶

01:18:08.785 --> 01:18:12.086
¶ Through the mountain ¶

01:18:21.464 --> 01:18:26.534
¶ I'm not so crazy ¶

01:18:26.769 --> 01:18:31.172
¶ It's my dream coming ¶

01:18:31.174 --> 01:18:36.243
¶ That's my calling ¶

01:18:37.413 --> 01:18:42.483
¶ Now I know where I'm going ¶

01:18:42.752 --> 01:18:47.888
¶ I'm gonna shed this old skin ¶

01:18:47.890 --> 01:18:52.226
¶ My heart is opening ¶

01:18:52.228 --> 01:18:56.030
¶ To a new, a new beginning ¶
