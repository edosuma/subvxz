06:35.245 --> 06:37.538
Marvin, you've gotta come see this shit.

06:37.622 --> 06:40.707
- Did you get my pictures?
- Yeah. But you gotta come outside.

06:40.792 --> 06:42.918
Me and Des found something.

06:44.129 --> 06:46.213
- What is it?
- You'll see.

06:48.883 --> 06:51.385
Mom's home.
She won't want me to leave without asking.

06:51.469 --> 06:54.263
Come on. We can sneak past.
<i>Citizen's Arrest</i> is on. You gotta.

06:55.932 --> 06:57.850
What is it you want me to see?

06:59.894 --> 07:01.812
I think we found a dead body.

07:09.696 --> 07:12.072
Going out, Mom. Back in a few.

07:12.157 --> 07:13.615
Stay close.

07:13.700 --> 07:16.994
<i>Your right hand behind your back now!</i>
<i>Give me your left arm!</i>

07:43.271 --> 07:44.646
Marvin.

07:47.150 --> 07:49.234
Shit. It's too dark to see now...

07:49.319 --> 07:51.612
but the body's down there.

07:53.323 --> 07:55.991
- I don't see anything.
- It's at the bottom.

07:56.701 --> 07:58.660
- Are you high, Rosy?
- No.

08:00.371 --> 08:02.289
It's been like two hours.

08:06.002 --> 08:08.128
-Jesus.
- Do you think it's real?

08:27.690 --> 08:30.651
- When did you guys find it?
- Find what?

08:30.735 --> 08:34.571
- The body in the sewer.
- I don't know. We were pretty messed up.

08:35.615 --> 08:37.324
Get doubles of these.

08:37.408 --> 08:39.535
I want to send one to the cops.

08:40.787 --> 08:44.623
Christ. If I'd known you were gonna get so
worked up about it, I wouldn't have shown you.

08:47.085 --> 08:49.503
Did you finish my biology homework?

08:52.257 --> 08:54.091
Look underneath.

09:07.730 --> 09:09.690
What do you see?

09:09.774 --> 09:12.609
Garbageman. He's new.

09:19.450 --> 09:20.450
Garbageman?

09:20.994 --> 09:23.704
The dark guy with the trash bags?

09:23.788 --> 09:25.956
He moved in last week above Birdman.

09:37.427 --> 09:39.344
What are you looking at now?

09:43.391 --> 09:45.058
Ma Bell.

09:45.143 --> 09:48.145
- Still yammering at the grandkids?
- Looks it.

09:49.814 --> 09:51.815
Did I tell you I met your Veiled Lady?

09:56.946 --> 09:59.531
- What's her name?
- Carmen.

09:59.616 --> 10:01.658
She's a dentist's assistant.

10:06.998 --> 10:08.874
Is she nice?

10:08.958 --> 10:11.418
Is she nice? Sure.

10:12.003 --> 10:15.130
Maybe I'll bring her around sometime.
You might like her.

10:16.924 --> 10:21.011
- You might even, I don't know, not die a virgin.
- Rosy.

10:21.095 --> 10:24.056
- Unless you're allergic to that too.
- Shut up.

10:24.682 --> 10:26.600
Don't be so hypersensitive.

10:26.684 --> 10:28.769
That gets funnier each time.

10:31.064 --> 10:32.481
Oh, my God.

10:32.565 --> 10:35.525
World's #1 Dad just lost his shit.

10:37.528 --> 10:39.696
And look.

10:41.699 --> 10:43.950
I found that downstairs.

10:45.244 --> 10:48.413
- Is that #1 Son?
- Yeah.

10:49.499 --> 10:52.250
And I took this two days ago.
You see the shadow?

10:52.335 --> 10:54.544
- It moved.
- Oh, my God.

10:54.629 --> 10:56.463
That shadow moved?

10:56.547 --> 10:58.256
Call the National Guard.

10:58.341 --> 11:00.467
Call the space marines.

11:01.052 --> 11:04.137
Call the cops.
They love this great feeb detective routine.

12:00.945 --> 12:03.029
You're scaring yourself because you're bored.

12:03.114 --> 12:04.948
I'm only looking.

12:05.032 --> 12:08.118
That picture is so blurry, it could be Bigfoot.

14:05.570 --> 14:07.028
Hey, Rose.

14:07.113 --> 14:08.738
Hey, Des.

14:09.282 --> 14:11.283
Check this out.

14:11.868 --> 14:13.869
You got any matches?

14:17.039 --> 14:18.915
What's up?

14:34.515 --> 14:36.308
Dinnertime!

14:40.605 --> 14:44.316
If you can stand to be away
from the window long enough to eat.

14:49.947 --> 14:51.698
Hi, Ma.

14:56.329 --> 14:58.079
Oh, God.

14:59.457 --> 15:02.125
What the neighbors must think.

15:05.129 --> 15:08.798
Hey. Why do you leave the lights on?
So they can see you?

15:08.883 --> 15:13.637
Hey, Ma. I seen Rosy with this guy...

15:14.472 --> 15:16.473
and I think he's a drug dealer.

15:18.142 --> 15:20.268
Rosy's a big girl.

15:20.353 --> 15:23.647
Yeah, but don't you think lately
she's been acting kind of off?

15:27.318 --> 15:29.361
You didn't like the lunch I made you.

15:32.114 --> 15:34.032
I took the pills.

15:36.494 --> 15:40.121
You can't live on pills alone.

15:40.206 --> 15:41.748
Oh, baby.

15:42.416 --> 15:45.710
You're so fragile,
you can't afford to skip a meal.

15:45.795 --> 15:47.545
Yeah. I wasn't hungry.

15:50.675 --> 15:55.178
I don't want to be made
to worry about you like that.

15:56.973 --> 16:01.142
I've been thinking again
about finding my own place.

16:08.150 --> 16:10.235
You know that's not possible.

16:10.861 --> 16:13.196
Dr. Carson seems to think
it's a really good idea.

16:13.280 --> 16:16.116
He only sees you once a month.
He doesn't know how you are.

16:16.200 --> 16:18.493
I'm 24 years old, Ma.

16:19.245 --> 16:21.371
I take care of things.

16:26.002 --> 16:27.961
Will you finish your dinner tonight?

16:28.045 --> 16:30.046
I can't stay here forever.

16:33.217 --> 16:35.176
I love you.

17:46.373 --> 17:48.208
- Carmen.
- Hi.

17:50.127 --> 17:52.253
Carmen, this is my brother.

17:52.338 --> 17:54.547
Marvin obviously knows who you are.

17:57.134 --> 17:59.469
Oh, my God. You weren't kidding.

18:03.724 --> 18:05.975
It's kind of pervy.

18:07.978 --> 18:09.813
You got a good eye.

18:09.897 --> 18:12.315
I got good subjects.

18:12.399 --> 18:14.651
What he's got is a compulsion.

18:14.735 --> 18:18.279
- How long have you been doing this?
- Ten years, I guess.

18:18.364 --> 18:20.490
Yeah, since he got sick.

18:20.574 --> 18:23.076
Yeah, I was one of
the last kids to get Strickler's.

18:24.370 --> 18:26.204
You were one of those roach kids?

18:27.081 --> 18:29.457
I prefer Bubble Boy.

18:30.584 --> 18:33.378
- Right on. What were they called again?
-Judas Breed.

18:33.462 --> 18:35.922
Right. You ever see any of them?

18:36.006 --> 18:38.258
- Nah, it didn't work like that.
- Sure you did.

18:38.342 --> 18:40.009
All the time.

18:40.094 --> 18:41.928
Shut up, Rosy.

18:42.012 --> 18:44.347
He was on the phone to the CDC
like every week.

18:44.431 --> 18:47.517
He thought he was fuckin'
Smoky the Bear of giant roaches or somethin'.

18:48.352 --> 18:51.354
- I was eight years old.
- Yeah. Try 16.

18:52.106 --> 18:55.608
His therapist said he felt bad
'cause they created the Judas for kids like him.

18:55.693 --> 18:58.153
You know, kill the roaches
that were making them sick.

18:58.237 --> 19:00.989
Oh, my God.
You didn't tell me I was on here.

19:01.657 --> 19:02.740
Yeahâ€”

19:03.617 --> 19:06.161
Did you want 'em back?
I mean, you want 'em?

19:06.829 --> 19:09.455
No. Why would I want pictures of myself?

19:14.670 --> 19:16.671
Can I have this one though?

19:19.508 --> 19:21.426
Yeah. Sure.

19:33.439 --> 19:35.398
- Can I look?
- Yeah, just a sec.

19:35.482 --> 19:38.276
- What do you see?
- Des is dealing Ma Bell dope.

19:38.360 --> 19:41.571
- What's a Des?
- Desmond. Her boyfriend.

19:41.655 --> 19:43.573
He's not my boyfriend.

19:45.576 --> 19:48.077
- You okay?
- And Ma Bell.

19:48.162 --> 19:50.705
She's always talking to her grandkids,
so we call her that.

19:50.789 --> 19:53.458
- Mrs. Leibowitz?
- Uh-huh. You know her?

19:53.542 --> 19:56.628
Yeah. I hear her at night.
She's a phone sex operator.

19:59.840 --> 20:01.591
Are you okay?

20:03.052 --> 20:04.510
You smoke.

20:04.595 --> 20:06.012
What?

20:06.096 --> 20:09.098
- It's an allergy thing.
- But I put it out before I even came inside.

20:09.183 --> 20:11.142
It doesn't matter. He's hypersensitive.

20:11.227 --> 20:13.770
Should I go? I'm sorry.

20:13.854 --> 20:15.939
Sorry. Sorry.

20:16.023 --> 20:17.690
- I'm sorry. I didn't think.
- It's all right.

20:17.775 --> 20:19.943
- I'm really sorry.
- Yeah, take it easy.

20:29.745 --> 20:31.663
I think she likes you.

21:14.790 --> 21:17.000
Ma Bell's running from something.

21:18.168 --> 21:19.210
No kidding.

21:31.348 --> 21:33.516
Garbageman's down there.

21:36.395 --> 21:38.313
Can you get me more film?

21:38.814 --> 21:40.523
I'm busy.

22:08.135 --> 22:09.844
Holy shit!

22:11.138 --> 22:12.388
What?

22:12.473 --> 22:13.973
He's hurt.

22:14.600 --> 22:17.101
- I think there's blood.
- Where is he?

22:34.244 --> 22:36.079
- Where?
- He's right there.

22:36.163 --> 22:37.914
Shit!

22:57.142 --> 22:59.310
Jesus. What happened?

22:59.395 --> 23:01.312
I don't know.

23:03.107 --> 23:05.024
What did you see?

23:34.972 --> 23:36.347
Mom?

23:38.183 --> 23:39.684
Mom.

23:40.269 --> 23:42.186
We have to call the cops.

23:47.734 --> 23:50.069
- Hi.
- Detective Dumars.

23:50.154 --> 23:53.322
- Thanks for coming.
- No problem.

23:54.241 --> 23:56.200
I'm Simone.

23:59.246 --> 24:00.872
Do I know you?

24:03.167 --> 24:05.251
Do you want to come in?

24:05.335 --> 24:06.836
Yeah.

24:10.632 --> 24:12.508
What seems to be the problem?

24:14.511 --> 24:17.013
My kids think they saw something.

24:17.097 --> 24:18.973
- Somebody was hurt.
- Killed.

24:33.864 --> 24:36.282
My son is a Strickler's disease survivor.

24:36.366 --> 24:40.161
He's environmentally hypersensitive.

24:40.245 --> 24:43.539
- It must be very hard on you.
- Yeah. It happened over there.

24:43.624 --> 24:46.292
- Near the entrance of the alley.
- His name's Desmond.

24:50.589 --> 24:52.757
He was covered in blood,
and then he disappeared.

24:54.343 --> 24:56.302
He was hurt?

24:56.386 --> 24:57.887
Yeah.

25:01.266 --> 25:05.520
Was... anybody else around?

25:05.604 --> 25:08.731
- He saw the Garbageman.
- I think I did.

25:10.484 --> 25:11.651
Okay.

25:11.735 --> 25:14.403
Okay, I bite. Who's the Garbageman?

25:19.284 --> 25:20.785
Him.

25:21.662 --> 25:24.580
- You took these pictures?
- It's his hobby.

25:25.082 --> 25:27.291
- Yeah.
- I'm not sure it's strictly legal.

25:29.127 --> 25:30.419
He's harmless.

25:36.760 --> 25:39.345
So this guy was at the scene
when what's his nameâ€”

25:39.429 --> 25:41.889
- Desmond.
- Desmondâ€” when Desmond disappeared.

25:41.974 --> 25:44.183
Yeah. And there was blood.

25:44.268 --> 25:45.977
The rain washed it away, butâ€”

25:46.728 --> 25:48.646
Get any pictures of that?

25:49.398 --> 25:52.400
- No. I was out of film.
- Yeah, wellâ€”

25:56.363 --> 25:58.739
Gee, I wonder what Desmond does for a living.

26:00.200 --> 26:02.076
- Cock.
- Rosy!

26:09.042 --> 26:10.751
Well...

26:12.713 --> 26:15.214
I might as well go have a chat
with the Garbageman.

26:26.560 --> 26:28.477
I don't see him.

26:45.203 --> 26:47.330
- The guy is harmless.
- Who is he?

26:47.414 --> 26:49.373
He didn't see anything strange happen.

26:49.458 --> 26:51.626
- Did you get his name?
- Never mind his name.

26:51.710 --> 26:54.462
What about the garbage bags?
Why does he only come out at night?

26:54.546 --> 26:56.589
Maybe he collects food
for the homeless shelters.

26:56.673 --> 26:59.216
What do you mean ''maybe''?
Did you even talk to him?

26:59.301 --> 27:00.801
Marvin.

27:04.640 --> 27:07.808
- I brought two glasses.
- No, my shift ends in 20 minutes.

27:08.393 --> 27:11.270
Is there a Mr. Montrose
I should be getting a statement from?

27:11.355 --> 27:12.730
- Yeah.
- No.

27:14.691 --> 27:16.192
Cancer.

27:16.693 --> 27:18.653
I'm so sorry to hear that.

27:19.363 --> 27:21.322
What about Desmond?

27:21.907 --> 27:23.491
Your friend, right?

27:25.243 --> 27:27.203
I don't know what to do, considering.

27:28.205 --> 27:30.122
Considering what?

27:30.207 --> 27:31.707
Marvin's past.

27:33.543 --> 27:36.170
That's where we first met. The precinct.

27:36.254 --> 27:39.840
I took your statement
the last time Marvin witnessed a... crime.

27:40.384 --> 27:43.469
Right. I'm surprised you remembered that.

27:43.553 --> 27:45.638
That must be at least three years ago.

27:45.722 --> 27:47.682
You didn't even talkâ€”

27:48.558 --> 27:50.101
Easy, Marvin.

27:51.353 --> 27:54.271
Maybe you need to spend
a little less time peeping in on the neighborsâ€”

27:54.356 --> 27:57.483
Look. We both saw Desmond get killed.

27:57.567 --> 27:58.984
Rosy! Please.

27:59.069 --> 28:01.570
No, no. She seems certain.

28:01.655 --> 28:03.155
Are you?

28:07.077 --> 28:09.161
What about you? What did you see?

28:11.123 --> 28:14.166
- Looked like something happened.
- It looked like something happened?

28:14.668 --> 28:17.253
Are you 100% sure, Marvin?

28:19.423 --> 28:21.716
You saw a murder?

28:23.593 --> 28:25.594
I don't know.

28:30.058 --> 28:32.810
It doesn't sound like trouble to me...

28:34.229 --> 28:37.523
but I can check in on you...
from time to time.

28:37.607 --> 28:39.650
Could you do that...

28:39.735 --> 28:41.610
Detective?

28:41.695 --> 28:43.487
Yeah. Sure.

28:43.572 --> 28:45.656
I could even put some of my guys on patrol.

28:46.950 --> 28:48.868
You know, keep an eye on the hood.

28:50.537 --> 28:53.831
And... call me Gary.

29:47.719 --> 29:49.970
No, no. That's not proper police procedure.

29:50.055 --> 29:51.931
Nobody would ever break the glass.

29:52.015 --> 29:54.517
- No?
- No. Are you kidding?

29:58.855 --> 30:01.524
- Come onâ€”
- Stop!

31:14.890 --> 31:16.849
- Rosy, hey.
- Hey, fink.

31:16.933 --> 31:19.351
- Hey, Carmen.
- Hi.

31:19.436 --> 31:22.062
You okay? I saw you outside.

31:23.398 --> 31:24.940
I'm fine.

31:26.776 --> 31:29.278
Is this thing about Rosy's dealer?

31:29.362 --> 31:31.113
He's not my dealer.

31:33.283 --> 31:36.869
Rosy was telling me about this garbage guy.
I think I've seen him around.

31:36.953 --> 31:39.121
What's he look like? His face.

31:39.205 --> 31:42.207
I don't know. It's a face.
I never really noticed.

31:43.251 --> 31:45.419
Are those the cops Dumars put downstairs?

31:45.503 --> 31:47.963
Yeah. Is he still on the couch with Mom?

31:48.048 --> 31:50.132
- Yep.
- Are you okay?

31:55.472 --> 31:58.265
I haven't smoked in two days.
Honest Indian.

31:58.350 --> 32:00.476
You're a good influence on me.

32:01.645 --> 32:04.188
- What the hell is he doing?
- Who?

32:04.272 --> 32:05.814
Garbageman.

32:06.483 --> 32:08.651
There's something glowing in his apartment.

32:13.698 --> 32:15.824
- Weird.
- Can I see?

32:17.077 --> 32:18.994
- You're wearing perfume.
- Yeah?

32:19.079 --> 32:21.080
God! I didn't even think.

32:21.164 --> 32:23.082
- It's okay.
- No, I'm so sorry. I didn't evenâ€”

32:23.166 --> 32:25.250
No, you know, he might just be allergic to you.

32:25.335 --> 32:26.669
Shut up, Rosy.

32:26.753 --> 32:29.004
- I'm gonna go.
- Yeah, I'm coming.

32:29.089 --> 32:30.839
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry. Okay.

32:30.924 --> 32:32.508
Okay. I'm sorry.

35:34.107 --> 35:35.649
Come in.

35:38.111 --> 35:39.611
- Hey.
- Hey.

35:39.696 --> 35:43.365
- You're alone.
- Yeah. Rosy's arguing with your mom and Dumars.

35:44.200 --> 35:45.701
- Guess what.
- What?

35:45.785 --> 35:49.663
I've given up everything.
No cigarettes, no perfume.

35:49.747 --> 35:51.790
I'm clean, harmless.

35:51.875 --> 35:54.001
You could eat off me.

35:55.211 --> 35:57.296
You've got a problem.

35:57.380 --> 35:59.548
God! What a corncob.

36:00.466 --> 36:02.509
What's Dumars doing now?

36:04.053 --> 36:06.805
Trying to pork Mom,
accusing me of being a junkie.

36:06.890 --> 36:08.765
I want to smash him.

36:08.850 --> 36:10.392
How's Garbage?

36:10.935 --> 36:13.103
He doesn't leave his apartment anymore.

36:13.188 --> 36:14.938
Just watches.

36:15.565 --> 36:17.649
Sounds familiar.

36:18.651 --> 36:21.695
Des has got to have been gone
long enough by now to be a missing person.

36:21.779 --> 36:23.655
Did you ask Officer Dumars?

36:24.407 --> 36:26.825
Whatever. He's got other things on his mind.

36:28.453 --> 36:30.495
Can I look?

36:30.580 --> 36:32.289
Sure.

36:40.256 --> 36:42.007
Are you okay?

36:43.593 --> 36:46.011
Are you taking anything?

36:47.430 --> 36:50.098
I haven't had anything since Des has been gone.

36:50.600 --> 36:52.768
That's part of the problem.

36:53.394 --> 36:55.103
There's Mrs. Leibowitz.

36:57.815 --> 37:01.318
Ma Bell. Yeah, she's been
down there for a while.

37:01.945 --> 37:04.279
I think she's looking for Desmond.

37:04.781 --> 37:07.157
Like Rosy. Lost a fix.

37:07.242 --> 37:09.201
Fuck off, Carmen.

37:09.285 --> 37:12.412
Or get on with fucking my brother
so I can stop chaperoning you over here.

37:13.414 --> 37:14.915
Rosy.

37:16.584 --> 37:18.168
I'm sorry.

37:18.753 --> 37:23.048
It's just... I don't know what we saw,
but it looked bad.

37:23.132 --> 37:27.302
And Garbagemanâ€” I gotta do something.

37:29.472 --> 37:31.890
You know, my dad's the building manager.

37:31.975 --> 37:34.768
- Bad idea.
- What idea?

37:35.478 --> 37:39.314
It would be the easiest thing
for me to get a key to Garbageman's apartment.

37:39.399 --> 37:41.275
Terrible. Terrible idea.

37:41.359 --> 37:44.444
And Marvin could keep watch for us.

37:46.155 --> 37:49.116
- Here's my mobile number.
- No. Haven't you guys seen this movie?

37:49.909 --> 37:51.702
Fuckin' terrible idea.

37:52.787 --> 37:54.496
What do you think?

37:57.250 --> 37:58.750
The Pastures.

38:00.503 --> 38:03.797
Adam Pasture.
The kid who disappeared last week.

38:03.881 --> 38:06.216
His family would have reported him missing.

38:06.301 --> 38:09.928
- So?
- So we could talk to them, see what they know.

38:10.013 --> 38:13.849
And it might help
get Dumars to take us serious...Iy.

38:39.584 --> 38:43.378
Come on. You can slip me a bit of tongue.
It's not gonna hurt. Is it?

38:44.047 --> 38:46.048
Something over here too.

38:48.885 --> 38:51.803
803. This should be the Pastures.

40:41.998 --> 40:42.998
Yeah?

40:43.082 --> 40:45.083
<i>It's Carmen.</i>
<i>There's no answer at the Pastures' place.</i>

40:45.168 --> 40:46.960
I can't see through the curtains.

40:47.044 --> 40:48.837
<i>What's Garbageman doing?</i>

40:50.506 --> 40:53.091
I can't tell. His apartment's dark.

40:53.176 --> 40:55.260
<i>- Maybe he's gone.</i>
- I don't know.

40:55.344 --> 40:57.637
He's been hanging out in the dark lately.

41:00.266 --> 41:02.434
- Jesus.
<i>- What?</i>

41:02.518 --> 41:06.188
Garbageman. He's in Birdman's apartment.

41:06.272 --> 41:07.814
<i>You sure?</i>

41:07.899 --> 41:09.691
He's just standing there.

41:09.775 --> 41:11.943
<i>Then he's not home.</i>

41:12.028 --> 41:13.528
Carmen.

41:52.527 --> 41:54.694
- Carmen.
<i>- Hey, Marvin. We're inside.</i>

41:54.779 --> 41:59.199
- Carmen, there's two of them.
<i>- God, it smells like shit in here. Two of who?</i>

41:59.283 --> 42:00.825
- Two garbagemen.
<i>- What?</i>

42:00.910 --> 42:04.120
Maybe neither of them are him.
Look. You need to get out of there.

42:04.914 --> 42:07.082
<i>Yeah, just a sec. Rosy found feathers.</i>

42:07.166 --> 42:13.380
<i>- They're gray, like pigeons or something.</i>
- I don't think it's him, Carmen.

42:13.464 --> 42:17.050
<i>Of course. I just figured out</i>
<i>what was glowing. It's his fridge.</i>

42:17.134 --> 42:20.887
<i>- It's padlocked though.</i>
- Carmen, get Rosy, get out of there.

42:20.972 --> 42:24.140
<i>- She's trying to find a light switch.</i>
- Carmen, can you hear me?

42:24.225 --> 42:28.436
<i>Yes, dear. I can hear you,</i>
<i>and I know you think this is a bad idea, butâ€”</i>

42:28.938 --> 42:31.106
Rosy, go! Carmen, get out!

42:38.239 --> 42:39.739
Fuck.

42:46.497 --> 42:47.622
Mom.

42:48.374 --> 42:49.666
Mom!

43:00.636 --> 43:02.137
Mom!

43:02.221 --> 43:04.139
Rosy's in trouble.

43:06.350 --> 43:09.978
- Ten minutes!
- Mom! It's serious.

43:12.857 --> 43:14.858
Goddamn it!

44:35.106 --> 44:38.149
-Just stop it!
- Why don't you listen to me?

44:38.234 --> 44:40.777
Damn it, Marvin!
You are way too old for this.

44:40.861 --> 44:44.406
- Please, just go over there.
- I just don't understand. Rosy wasâ€”

44:44.490 --> 44:47.117
Rosy was in Garbageman's apartment,
and then he took her!

44:47.201 --> 44:50.286
- What do you mean he took her?
- Jesus Christ! Haven't we bugged this guy enough?

44:50.371 --> 44:52.080
Rosy could be dead right now.

44:52.957 --> 44:54.958
- I'm calling the cops.
- I <i>am</i> the cops.

44:55.042 --> 44:56.793
I mean the real cops.

45:03.092 --> 45:04.342
Rosy.

45:04.427 --> 45:07.846
- She says she lives here.
- Yeah, yeah. We're her parents.

45:07.930 --> 45:10.265
Then I'd appreciate it
if you kept a closer eye on her.

45:10.349 --> 45:13.017
- Are you okay?
- What happened exactly?

45:13.102 --> 45:16.730
She was in my apartment.
I don't think she stole anything.

45:16.814 --> 45:19.399
What were you doing in there?
Are you stealing?

45:20.860 --> 45:22.986
Is this about drugs?

45:23.070 --> 45:25.613
- No.
- This won't happen again. I guarantee.

45:26.323 --> 45:29.826
You are not leaving your room
until you are cleaned up. You understand?

45:29.910 --> 45:32.287
- Who do you think you are?
- Rosy!

45:32.788 --> 45:34.914
Now you are grounded. Get in your room.

45:34.999 --> 45:36.499
Fuck off.

45:36.584 --> 45:38.501
Rosy.

45:39.962 --> 45:42.797
- I'm sorry.
- I'll file a police report if you want.

45:42.882 --> 45:45.133
No. Thank you.

45:45.217 --> 45:47.719
Yeah. Thank you.
We won't bother you again.

45:47.803 --> 45:50.263
- I appreciate that.
- Good night.

45:50.347 --> 45:51.931
Good night.

45:58.063 --> 45:59.981
Why didn't he recognize you?

46:00.065 --> 46:02.567
I thought you had a talk with him.

46:06.155 --> 46:08.406
Why do you insist on doing this to your mother?

46:08.491 --> 46:10.658
You're too old to ground.

46:11.660 --> 46:14.078
He couldn't go anywhere anyway.

47:27.069 --> 47:28.570
Okay.

47:28.654 --> 47:30.446
I'll see you in a sec.

47:49.800 --> 47:51.885
- Thanks.
- How you doing?

47:52.595 --> 47:55.179
Good. Carmen's place is great.

47:56.515 --> 47:59.350
- You think you'll stay long?
- I don't know.

47:59.435 --> 48:02.186
Do you think Dumars has any terminal diseases?

48:10.696 --> 48:14.324
Yeah, yeah. Okay, babe.
Sure. I'll talk to you soon.

48:17.244 --> 48:18.745
Yeah.

48:18.829 --> 48:21.080
Talk to you soon. Bye.

48:23.042 --> 48:25.209
- Marvin.
- You're in my room.

48:25.294 --> 48:28.171
That was your mom. She'll be home soon.

48:30.674 --> 48:31.758
Whoops.

48:31.842 --> 48:33.509
- Leave it.
- Sorry.

48:33.594 --> 48:35.595
I said leave it!

48:39.516 --> 48:41.392
So, Marvin...

48:45.272 --> 48:47.106
I want us to be friends, all right?

48:47.191 --> 48:50.902
So what exactly is your beef?

48:50.986 --> 48:52.987
I just don't know what you're doing.

48:54.156 --> 48:55.156
Wellâ€”

48:57.159 --> 49:01.412
Your momâ€” she's a special lady.

49:01.497 --> 49:04.123
And she really digs me.

49:04.708 --> 49:07.877
And I think that what we've got
is something that could really blossomâ€”

49:07.962 --> 49:10.797
No, no. I don't want to know
what you're doing with Mom...

49:10.881 --> 49:13.257
just so long as you never pretend to be my dad.

49:19.390 --> 49:22.809
And stop pretending
that you don't believe me...

49:22.893 --> 49:25.019
and keep assigning these guys to the courtyard.

49:25.104 --> 49:26.604
What?

49:26.689 --> 49:29.065
And who's the official-looking guy in the car?

49:29.733 --> 49:31.734
Let me see.

49:35.030 --> 49:37.073
And there's another one.

49:38.158 --> 49:40.076
And another one.

49:42.413 --> 49:44.539
Those aren't my guys.

49:46.000 --> 49:49.335
I might as well be a beat cop.
I don't even have guys.

49:54.550 --> 49:56.050
I'm...

49:57.011 --> 49:58.720
sorry.

49:58.804 --> 50:00.805
I was trying to impress your mom.

50:01.598 --> 50:04.892
I don't even have the authority
to put men on patrol.

50:05.602 --> 50:07.895
Then who are they?

50:08.480 --> 50:09.981
Well...

50:10.566 --> 50:12.567
maybe I should find out.

50:40.304 --> 50:42.346
Hey. You're home.

50:42.431 --> 50:45.975
- What are you doing out here?
- Trying not to smoke.

50:46.643 --> 50:48.978
Because of Marvin? That's so sweet.

50:49.063 --> 50:51.355
Shit. It's Garbageman.

50:54.443 --> 50:56.527
What the hell is this?

50:57.071 --> 50:59.197
This was supposed to happen tomorrow.

51:00.240 --> 51:02.366
I'm out of time.

51:02.451 --> 51:04.494
It's now or never.

51:05.829 --> 51:07.622
Is it stable?

51:09.458 --> 51:11.417
If you keep it cold.

51:15.506 --> 51:17.548
I don't like it.

52:11.603 --> 52:13.104
Watch it!

52:13.772 --> 52:15.606
I'm very, very sorry.

52:15.691 --> 52:17.191
- You're sorry?
- I am.

52:17.276 --> 52:19.694
It was a mistake. A little mistake.

52:19.778 --> 52:21.362
I'm very sorry.

52:45.387 --> 52:47.305
Excuse me. Sir.

52:47.389 --> 52:48.389
Sir.

52:57.774 --> 52:59.609
Just a moment.

54:00.003 --> 54:01.629
Phone.

54:02.256 --> 54:04.298
Where's the fucking phone?

54:10.389 --> 54:12.306
<i>- Marvin.</i>
- Where are you?

54:12.391 --> 54:14.976
<i>Downstairs, following Garbageman.</i>
<i>We need your eyes.</i>

54:15.060 --> 54:17.019
We need help. Did youâ€”

54:56.852 --> 54:58.352
Close it.

55:01.023 --> 55:02.523
Now.

55:07.529 --> 55:10.656
<i>The mobile customer you are</i>
<i>trying to reach is currently unavailable.</i>

55:31.887 --> 55:33.387
Oh, my God.

55:45.400 --> 55:47.068
Well...

55:47.903 --> 55:49.403
fuck.

55:50.572 --> 55:52.323
What's going on?

55:54.117 --> 55:56.118
You're about to get what you paid for.

55:58.497 --> 55:59.580
Rosy.

56:18.767 --> 56:19.642
Fuck.

56:27.484 --> 56:28.943
Oh, my God.

56:55.679 --> 56:57.805
Oh, my God.

57:03.019 --> 57:04.603
Oh, my God.

57:06.982 --> 57:08.149
No!

57:29.921 --> 57:31.922
Let me help.

57:36.303 --> 57:39.013
- She won't stop bleeding.
- Good.

57:41.099 --> 57:43.142
The blood draws 'em.

57:55.906 --> 57:58.115
No! No!

58:00.118 --> 58:02.369
Oh, my God. No!

58:03.455 --> 58:05.331
Let her out!

58:05.415 --> 58:08.209
Hush. You're gonna help me.

58:16.927 --> 58:18.719
Come on, come on.

58:33.944 --> 58:35.736
Come on, come on.

58:45.914 --> 58:47.665
<i>911 emergency.</i>

58:47.749 --> 58:50.334
I need help.
The Judas Breedâ€” I've seen two of them.

58:50.418 --> 58:52.670
<i>- Would you repeat that, sir?</i>
- Two people are dead.

58:52.754 --> 58:54.838
A cop is dead.

58:54.923 --> 58:58.217
My sister's been... killed.

59:41.803 --> 59:43.304
No!

59:50.937 --> 59:52.438
Come on. Come on.

59:55.650 --> 59:57.151
Go.

1:01:39.295 --> 1:01:41.296
Give me the goddamn phone.

1:01:44.926 --> 1:01:46.885
- A Judas egg.
- Smart boy.

1:01:46.970 --> 1:01:48.971
That's a king egg. That's a fertile male.

1:01:49.055 --> 1:01:51.181
Yeah. I have an emergency.

1:01:51.266 --> 1:01:55.436
Forward this to the CDC,
AD Kirschnerâ€• immediately.

1:01:56.062 --> 1:02:00.107
Authorization 197-667.
We have two specimens.

1:02:00.859 --> 1:02:02.776
They're soldier caste.

1:02:02.861 --> 1:02:04.778
Probably more.

1:02:06.197 --> 1:02:09.158
- What's the matter with you?
- I'm allergic to roaches.

1:02:09.242 --> 1:02:10.284
Right.

1:02:11.369 --> 1:02:13.787
Then you'll be my coal miners' canary.

1:02:15.957 --> 1:02:18.000
Put that in the fridge.

1:02:19.085 --> 1:02:22.504
Nobody does anything stupid,
and nobody has to die early.

1:02:22.589 --> 1:02:24.715
We have to destroy it.

1:02:24.799 --> 1:02:26.800
Now that qualifies as stupid.

1:02:27.635 --> 1:02:31.722
A fertile male could establish a new colony,
a new outbreak.

1:02:31.806 --> 1:02:33.557
Deck chairs on the <i>Titanic.</i>

1:02:33.641 --> 1:02:37.728
That egg is one of thousands underground.
They're hoarding them, waiting.

1:02:37.812 --> 1:02:40.063
We have to destroy it. We have to try.

1:02:40.148 --> 1:02:43.192
Hey, I will kill you.
So help me, God, I'll kill you.

1:02:44.068 --> 1:02:45.527
Here.

1:02:45.612 --> 1:02:47.321
That egg equals my getaway moneyâ€”

1:02:47.405 --> 1:02:49.656
as far from civilization as I can get.

1:02:49.741 --> 1:02:51.700
We've already lost.

1:02:51.785 --> 1:02:53.827
It's over.

1:02:55.538 --> 1:02:58.081
- Empty that around the door.
- It's kerosene.

1:02:58.166 --> 1:03:01.126
- They don't like fire. Empty it.
- That doesn't make any sense.

1:03:01.211 --> 1:03:04.588
- They don't have the intelligence toâ€”
- Strategize, reason?

1:03:04.672 --> 1:03:06.632
They adapt. That's how we made them.

1:03:06.716 --> 1:03:10.052
They don't have to be any bigger
or stronger, so they got smarter.

1:03:10.136 --> 1:03:12.262
This is not a city anymore.

1:03:12.347 --> 1:03:14.807
It's a goddamn killing jar.

1:03:15.642 --> 1:03:16.725
The door.

1:03:27.278 --> 1:03:29.029
- Mom.
- Yeah.

1:03:29.572 --> 1:03:31.240
Why aren't you in your room?

1:03:31.324 --> 1:03:33.116
Run!

1:03:33.201 --> 1:03:36.036
- Close the goddamn door.
- Oh, my God.

1:05:16.429 --> 1:05:18.764
Don't shoot. It's us.

1:05:20.850 --> 1:05:22.392
Marvin.

1:05:55.843 --> 1:05:57.386
Oh, my God.

1:09:43.404 --> 1:09:46.698
<i>They already swept down on five,</i>
<i>so I can come help with what you got.</i>

1:09:46.782 --> 1:09:48.575
<i>Your assistance is on the way.</i>

1:09:48.659 --> 1:09:52.245
<i>Southeast end of the building.</i>
<i>Any revise on last update?</i>

1:09:52.955 --> 1:09:54.497
<i>Not sure.</i>

1:09:54.582 --> 1:09:56.082
<i>So they said.</i>

1:11:06.988 --> 1:11:08.863
Is Carmenâ€”

1:11:08.948 --> 1:11:10.657
Is Carmen alive?

1:11:10.741 --> 1:11:12.742
He's trying to talk.
