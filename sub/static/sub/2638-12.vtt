WEBVTT

00:00.720 --> 00:03.469
All right,
that's the last servo.

00:04.160 --> 00:09.440
Behold the Mobile
Omnidirectional Neutralization
and Termination Eradicator.

00:09.450 --> 00:12.760
Or...MONTE.

00:13.440 --> 00:18.030
Featuring one articulated razor-sharp
killing saw,one polycarbonate grinding
and flipping wheel,

00:18.040 --> 00:23.530
steel-armor plate exoskeleton
top and bottom,and enough horsepower to drive
a 110 pounds of mechanized death

00:23.540 --> 00:27.650
from zero to holy crap
in 4.8 seconds.

00:27.660 --> 00:31.020
Is it wrong to say I
love our killer robot?

00:31.440 --> 00:35.410
As with my father,
I both love and fear it.

00:35.420 --> 00:38.600
All right, enough chitchat.
Let's destroy something.

00:38.740 --> 00:40.720
1,2,3

00:40.730 --> 00:43.760
Okay. What shall be first
to taste the wrath of Monte?

00:43.770 --> 00:45.840
*************

00:45.850 --> 00:51.620
**************

00:52.610 --> 00:53.900
Did it when I was four.

00:53.920 --> 00:57.340
It's an icosahedral dye
floating in tinted blue water.

00:57.800 --> 01:01.550
Man, call "spoiler alert"
before you say things like that.

01:02.120 --> 01:03.970
How about the toaster oven?

01:03.980 --> 01:05.910
What did the toaster
oven ever do to you?

01:05.920 --> 01:08.390
What did I ever do to Jimmy
Mullins in the third grade?

01:08.400 --> 01:11.320
He still punched me in
the face with my own fists.

01:11.990 --> 01:16.140
Sorry, you little nerd, you were just in
the wrong boys' room at the wrong time.

01:17.210 --> 01:19.400
Gentlemen, goggles.

01:19.410 --> 01:21.570
This is an auspicious moment.

01:21.600 --> 01:24.550
Like Robert Oppenheimer
or Neil Armstrong,

01:24.580 --> 01:29.120
we need the appropriate words to
mark this historic scientific event.

01:30.250 --> 01:33.120
How about "Die, toaster, die"?

01:34.050 --> 01:36.160
That'll do it.

01:58.210 --> 02:00.500
All right, what's next?

02:01.020 --> 02:04.190
No, I think I'm just going to
stay in tonight and do laundry.

Oh, yeah, this door got the full Monte.

02:33.840 --> 02:35.220
Leonard?

02:35.230 --> 02:37.180
What the hell?

02:37.700 --> 02:39.410
Killer robot. We built it.

02:39.420 --> 02:41.680
Yeah, well, it almost killed me.

02:41.700 --> 02:44.770
If it wanted to kill you, you'd be dead.

02:48.670 --> 02:51.360
So, who exactly does it want to kill?

02:51.380 --> 02:57.880
I'm sorry, are you unaware of the upcoming Southern
California Robot Fighting League Round Robin Invitational?

02:59.640 --> 03:03.880
You know, since I moved last year,
not all my mail has been forwarded.

03:05.450 --> 03:07.030
It's a big deal.

03:07.060 --> 03:10.800
There's an awards banquet
and a dance afterward.

03:10.810 --> 03:14.170
Perhaps you'd like to come with me.

03:15.120 --> 03:18.570
I know the other fellas would be
really excited to see a girl there.

03:19.890 --> 03:22.050
How is it supposed to be a
dance if I'm the only girl?

03:22.070 --> 03:24.950
Well, that may be a slight exaggeration.

03:24.970 --> 03:27.560
You'd be the only doable girl.

03:30.100 --> 03:32.650
You're a pig, Howard.

03:32.660 --> 03:35.620
How is "doable" anything
but a compliment?

03:35.640 --> 03:37.230
Howard, why don't we
just work on the robot?

03:37.250 --> 03:38.390
Please, Leonard, not now.

03:38.410 --> 03:42.390
Once again, Penny and I
have begun our little tango.

03:42.870 --> 03:44.580
Our tango?

03:44.600 --> 03:47.700
The carnal repartee,
the erotic to and fro.

03:47.710 --> 03:51.050
But as delicious as
the appetizer might be,

03:51.070 --> 03:56.410
at some point we will have to succumb
and eat the entr\e while it's still...

04:02.960 --> 04:04.990
hot.

04:07.350 --> 04:10.410
I'm begging you, stop talking.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.270
Look, normally I can just ignore you.

04:13.290 --> 04:14.980
I mean, I get it--
you're a little peculiar.

04:14.990 --> 04:16.100
You know, like Sheldon.

04:16.110 --> 04:20.180
Excuse me, Penny, but in this
room, you're the one who's peculiar.

04:22.040 --> 04:24.460
Yeah, you might be right.

04:24.470 --> 04:25.300
But back to you.

04:25.310 --> 04:28.080
I know you think you're some sort
of smooth-talking ladies' man,

04:28.090 --> 04:31.530
but the truth is, you are
just pathetic and creepy.

04:34.070 --> 04:36.890
So what are you saying?

04:36.900 --> 04:40.590
I am saying it is not a
compliment to call me "doable."

04:40.620 --> 04:42.920
It's not sexy to stare
at my ass and say, Ooh,

04:42.930 --> 04:46.050
it must be jelly 'cause
jam don't shake like that.

04:46.510 --> 04:50.670
And most important, we are not dancing
a tango, we're not to'ing and fro'ing.

04:50.700 --> 04:53.750
Nothing is ever going to
happen between us. Ever.

04:54.730 --> 04:58.810
Wait a minute. This isn't
flirting. You're serious.

04:59.280 --> 05:01.140
Flirting? You think
I'm flirting with you?

05:01.150 --> 05:02.500
I am not flirting with you.

05:02.510 --> 05:04.410
No woman is ever gonna flirt with you.

05:04.430 --> 05:07.710
You're just gonna
grow old and die alone.

05:11.170 --> 05:13.840
Thanks for the heads up.

05:14.740 --> 05:15.950
Howard, where you going?

05:15.990 --> 05:20.180
I'm going home to live
my creepy, pathetic life.

05:23.530 --> 05:26.340
Well, someone had to say it.

05:31.170 --> 05:32.320
What?

05:32.350 --> 05:36.520
He said maybe we should enter you
in the killer robot competition.

05:51.710 --> 05:55.500
Howard, the phone is ringing!

05:55.910 --> 05:59.870
Here's a crazy idea, Ma: Answer it!

06:01.290 --> 06:02.820
Hello?

06:02.840 --> 06:04.430
All right, hold on.

06:04.460 --> 06:06.340
It's your friend, Leonard!

06:06.360 --> 06:10.150
He wants to know why
you're not at school today!

06:11.080 --> 06:15.960
I don't go to school, Ma.
I work at a university.

06:15.970 --> 06:19.210
That's a school! Now pick up the phone!

06:19.220 --> 06:21.140
I don't want to talk to anybody.

06:21.150 --> 06:24.930
Should I ask Leonard to
bring over your homework? !

06:25.660 --> 06:27.430
I don't have homework.

06:27.450 --> 06:31.250
I'm a grown man with a
master's degree in engineering!

06:31.270 --> 06:34.750
Excuse me, Mr. Fancy-Pants.

06:34.760 --> 06:36.800
Want me to get you a Popsicle?

06:36.820 --> 06:40.070
Cherry, please!

06:40.490 --> 06:44.360
I ate the cherry. All
that's left is green.

06:44.370 --> 06:47.300
You make me want to kill myself.

06:48.190 --> 06:49.100
What's going on?

06:49.130 --> 06:52.640
I don't know, now they're
just yelling about Popsicles.

06:54.280 --> 06:56.200
Sounds like Penny really got to him.

06:56.220 --> 06:57.100
I'm not surprised.

06:57.130 --> 07:00.150
Despite his hard and crusty shell,
Howard is a very sensitive man.

07:00.180 --> 07:02.790
Do you know he writes poetry?

07:03.250 --> 07:06.440
Mostly about men from Nantucket
and hermits named Dave,

07:07.230 --> 07:10.020
but he does it with real sensitivity.

07:10.030 --> 07:11.530
Hey, Hofstadter.

07:11.540 --> 07:14.650
Word around the pwasma
wab is you built a wobot?

07:15.160 --> 07:16.370
Yes, we did, Kripke.

07:16.380 --> 07:18.370
His name is Monte.

07:18.390 --> 07:21.380
Well, if you have any dewusions
about entering him against my wobot,

07:21.410 --> 07:25.750
the Kwipke Kwippler in the Southern California
Robot Fighting League Wound Wobin Invitational,

07:25.770 --> 07:28.230
aka the S.C.R.F.L.R.R.I.,

07:28.250 --> 07:31.290
his name is gonna be Swrap Metal.

07:31.300 --> 07:33.700
Come on, is that really necessary?

07:33.720 --> 07:35.440
Leonard, I believe it is.

07:35.470 --> 07:40.550
This is trash talk, and trash talk is a
traditional component in all sporting events.

07:42.080 --> 07:47.060
Kripke, your robot is inferior
and it will be defeated by ours

07:47.090 --> 07:51.460
because ours exceeds yours
in both design and execution.

07:52.320 --> 07:56.500
Also, I'm given to understand
that your mother is overweight.

07:58.710 --> 08:01.010
Oh, snap.

08:01.020 --> 08:04.120
Now, of course, if that is the result of a
glandular condition and not sloth and gluttony,

08:04.150 --> 08:06.720
I withdraw that comment.

08:06.940 --> 08:08.990
What difference does
it make? Fat is fat.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.980
There are boundaries.

08:10.990 --> 08:15.160
Tell you what, forget
the S.C.R.F.L.R.R.I.

08:15.170 --> 08:18.740
Wet's settle this woboto a woboto.

08:19.410 --> 08:20.250
What do you mean?

08:20.270 --> 08:23.050
There's no guarantee we're gonna go
against each other in the Wound Wobin,

08:23.070 --> 08:25.130
so let's throw down.

08:25.150 --> 08:28.370
You know, unless you're afwaid.

08:28.880 --> 08:31.710
We accept your challenge.
Name a time and place.

08:31.720 --> 08:33.370
Tomorrow, 3:00, the kinetics wab.

08:33.390 --> 08:34.380
Make it so.

08:34.390 --> 08:37.400
No, don't make it so. Barry,
we can't fight you tomorrow.

08:37.409 --> 08:39.650
Our engineer is incapacitated.

08:39.669 --> 08:40.679
What's wrong with him?

08:40.690 --> 08:44.490
He's depressed because he's pathetic
and creepy and can't get girls.

08:45.560 --> 08:50.340
We're all pathetic and
cweepy and can't get girls.

08:50.350 --> 08:53.680
That's why we fight wobots.

08:55.010 --> 08:58.130
If you're not there, you'll
be exposed to widicule.

08:59.800 --> 09:03.440
I'm curious, what part of
America is that accent from?

09:09.100 --> 09:10.420
Hey, you got a minute?

09:10.440 --> 09:12.840
Yeah, come on in. What's up?

09:13.150 --> 09:16.080
- I need you to apologize to How...
- Get out.

09:16.780 --> 09:20.640
Come on. Wolowitz won't come out of his
house and we need him for a robot battle.

09:20.650 --> 09:23.080
Well, then have the
robot go and get him.

09:23.090 --> 09:24.760
The robot didn't hurt his feelings.

09:24.770 --> 09:26.770
His feelings needed to be hurt.

09:26.790 --> 09:28.530
He's been in bed for two days.

09:28.550 --> 09:31.340
Yeah, probably with a blow-up doll.

09:32.450 --> 09:34.020
He's not with a...

09:34.040 --> 09:36.950
Does it really matter
who or what he's with?

09:36.970 --> 09:38.610
The guy is devastated.

09:38.640 --> 09:42.200
Oh, please, how could I
possibly devastate Howard?

09:42.230 --> 09:44.640
Okay, don't take this as a criticism,

09:44.650 --> 09:48.770
but you kind of have that
overexposed-to-gamma-rays thing going on.

09:48.810 --> 09:50.340
What does that mean?

09:50.350 --> 09:53.340
You know, like, most of the time,
you're the easygoing Bruce Banner,

09:53.370 --> 09:57.220
but then, when you get angry, you
kind of turn into, like, you know...

10:00.370 --> 10:02.680
I turn into a bear?

10:03.280 --> 10:05.050
Seriously? Gamma rays? Bruce Banner?

10:05.060 --> 10:07.680
You didn't get The
Incredible Hulk from that?

10:08.180 --> 10:10.920
Never mind. Just, please go talk to him.

10:10.930 --> 10:14.010
And say what? That I didn't
mean it, because I meant it.

10:14.020 --> 10:17.530
Well, maybe you can go at it
from a different angle, like, um,

10:17.550 --> 10:21.980
you see a glimmer of goodness in
him and you only said what you said

10:22.010 --> 10:25.900
because you want to nurture
it and make it shine.

10:30.160 --> 10:32.310
Okay, let's try it this way.

10:32.340 --> 10:33.740
Remember the day that we first met

10:33.750 --> 10:37.450
and you asked me to go to your
boyfriend's apartment to get your TV back

10:37.470 --> 10:42.100
and he was nine feet tall and he
took my pants off and you said...

10:42.110 --> 10:43.840
What was that? What did you say?

10:43.850 --> 10:47.310
Oh, yes. You said you owed me one.

10:48.160 --> 10:49.930
Okay, come on, that's not fair.

10:49.950 --> 10:52.910
I came home with no pants.

10:54.480 --> 10:57.410
Fine, I'll go over there tomorrow.

10:57.430 --> 10:59.770
Thank you.

11:00.380 --> 11:03.500
I should probably give you
a heads up about his mother.

11:03.520 --> 11:05.170
What about her?

11:05.180 --> 11:08.000
She's a delightful
woman. You'll love her.

11:11.350 --> 11:15.550
Howard, there's a blonde
girl, Patsy, here to see you!

11:16.460 --> 11:17.520
Who?

11:17.540 --> 11:20.610
Okay, now she's saying it's Penny.

11:21.660 --> 11:24.180
I don't want to talk to her.

11:24.190 --> 11:25.410
Ma!

11:25.430 --> 11:27.270
She ran past me.

11:27.290 --> 11:30.020
Was I supposed to tackle her?

11:31.530 --> 11:35.130
So, I just came by to
see how you were doing.

11:35.150 --> 11:36.740
I'm fine.

11:37.280 --> 11:40.840
Good. Your mom seems nice.

11:41.510 --> 11:44.970
People move away from her on the bus.

11:46.540 --> 11:48.960
What do you want?

11:48.990 --> 11:54.610
Okay, look. Howard, I
just want to apologize.

11:57.700 --> 12:01.200
For some things that I have said.

12:02.590 --> 12:05.160
About you.

12:06.270 --> 12:10.070
I've been informed
that you have feelings.

12:11.920 --> 12:15.120
And apparently, I have hurt them.

12:15.410 --> 12:18.860
So, I'm sorry.

12:19.510 --> 12:22.200
Howard.

12:22.890 --> 12:26.130
Fine. You're sorry. Good-bye.

12:26.140 --> 12:28.890
So... you're okay?

12:28.900 --> 12:30.670
Hey, I'm a big boy.

12:30.710 --> 12:35.300
I'm not traumatized by some random
comment from some random woman.

12:35.320 --> 12:38.740
I mean, get over yourself.

12:40.550 --> 12:44.570
Okay. Well, bye.

12:51.570 --> 12:54.080
So close.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.570
Oh, my God. That's Kripke's robot?

13:03.580 --> 13:08.450
As you can see, the Kwippler is
weducing the Chevy Cavawier to wubble.

13:09.430 --> 13:11.140
I can't watch anymore.

13:11.150 --> 13:12.710
Sheldon, we have to call it off.

13:12.730 --> 13:14.190
We don't have that option.

13:14.200 --> 13:15.460
We've accepted the challenge.

13:15.480 --> 13:16.910
We can't run away from a fight.

13:16.930 --> 13:20.940
Oh, please, we've spent our whole
lives running away from fights.

13:21.500 --> 13:25.270
Personally, I can squeeze through
a hole in a fence half my size.

13:25.280 --> 13:28.800
Impressive as that may
be, Monte is not us.

13:28.830 --> 13:30.950
Monte has no fear.

13:30.980 --> 13:33.310
Sheldon, did we all not
just watch the same video?

13:33.350 --> 13:37.410
Kripke's robot just had angry
sex with a mid-sized automobile.

13:38.210 --> 13:40.690
You are overlooking the fact that
we now know what we're up against

13:40.710 --> 13:43.250
and we can modify Monte
so that he's prepared.

13:43.270 --> 13:44.610
You want to prepare him?

13:44.630 --> 13:48.260
Install a bladder and a pair
of shorts so he can wet himself.

13:48.960 --> 13:52.460
Excuse me, but how are we going to
make any modifications without Wolowitz?

13:52.480 --> 13:54.100
- Have you heard from Penny yet?
- Not yet.

13:54.110 --> 13:56.750
Have faith, gentlemen.
We don't need Wolowitz.

13:56.760 --> 14:00.660
Engineering is merely the slow
younger brother of physics.

14:01.230 --> 14:03.430
Watch and learn.

14:07.360 --> 14:10.440
Do either of you know
how to open the toolbox?

14:12.690 --> 14:18.000
And then, when I was
14, I met Marcy Grossman.

14:18.630 --> 14:20.920
She was so beautiful.

14:20.930 --> 14:26.630
She just got her braces off but
they left a little of the overbite.

14:27.620 --> 14:30.510
It was so hot.

14:31.100 --> 14:34.230
Like a sexy little chipmunk.

14:38.410 --> 14:41.450
I didn't have the
courage to ask her out,

14:41.470 --> 14:47.010
but I dedicated a song to her
at the ninth grade talent show.

14:47.030 --> 14:48.540
Aw, that sounds sweet.

14:48.570 --> 14:52.060
* Marcy Grossman is sunshine *

14:52.080 --> 14:55.770
* On a cloudy day *

14:55.810 --> 14:59.550
* When it's cold outside *

14:59.580 --> 15:02.430
* Marcy Grossman is the month of May *

15:02.440 --> 15:03.550
Oh, it's cute.

15:03.580 --> 15:08.050
* I guess you'd say *

15:08.060 --> 15:12.580
* What can make me feel this way *

15:12.590 --> 15:16.150
* Marcy Grossman, Marcy
Grossman, Marcy Grossman *

15:16.160 --> 15:19.650
* Talkin' 'bout Marcy * That's great.

15:19.660 --> 15:21.540
* Grossman.*

15:21.550 --> 15:23.940
Oh, it's fun.

15:23.960 --> 15:28.460
And then she came up with
that sexy little chipmunk mouth

15:28.470 --> 15:30.930
and spit in my hair.

15:34.730 --> 15:37.490
Which brings us to tenth grade.

15:38.170 --> 15:43.110
Howard, do you think maybe
sometimes you try too hard?

15:45.120 --> 15:47.240
Look at me.

15:47.260 --> 15:51.210
What chance do I have
if I don't try too hard?

15:51.920 --> 15:54.570
Well... you'd have a terrific chance.

15:54.580 --> 15:57.340
I mean, you're smart, you're
funny. You have a cool job.

15:57.350 --> 16:00.220
You build stuff that
goes into outer space.

16:00.240 --> 16:01.130
I guess.

16:01.160 --> 16:03.420
Look, I'm telling you, I've known
you for, like, a year and a half

16:03.430 --> 16:07.600
and this is the first time I feel
like I'm talking to a real person.

16:07.610 --> 16:12.160
And you know what? I
like him. He's a nice guy.

16:13.200 --> 16:14.790
You really think so?

16:14.810 --> 16:16.870
Yes.

16:16.880 --> 16:19.180
I don't know.

16:19.190 --> 16:21.390
I do.

16:37.220 --> 16:38.940
Nice little bot you've got here.

16:38.960 --> 16:40.910
I'm aware.

16:41.470 --> 16:45.560
- What's this do, spin?
- Yep. At 3400 RPM.

16:45.570 --> 16:48.570
It can cut through
steel like it was wubber.

16:50.300 --> 16:52.640
Neat.

16:53.060 --> 16:54.770
Good work.

16:54.790 --> 16:56.890
Sheldon, we've got to call this off.

16:56.900 --> 16:58.210
No, Leonard.

16:58.220 --> 17:03.040
For years, merciless thugs like Kripke have
made my life a series of painful noogies

17:03.080 --> 17:07.730
and humiliating wedgies and the
insensitively named Indian burns.

17:08.609 --> 17:10.140
That stops now.

17:10.170 --> 17:11.490
But, Sheldon, we don't have a chance.

17:11.520 --> 17:16.329
The only improvement you were able to make on the
robot was to put fresh batteries in the remote.

17:16.339 --> 17:19.819
What you fail to realize is
Kripke suffers from a fatal flaw:

17:19.839 --> 17:24.300
overconfidence from his robot's
massive size and its overwhelming power.

17:24.319 --> 17:27.359
That's not overconfidence.
That's observation.

17:27.680 --> 17:32.740
Trust me, Kripke will fall easy prey
to my psychological warfare. Observe.

17:33.840 --> 17:36.430
Kripke.

17:36.460 --> 17:40.750
I would ask if your robot is prepared to
meet its maker, but as you are its maker,

17:40.760 --> 17:43.630
clearly the two of you have met.

17:46.760 --> 17:49.830
What is his pwoblem?

17:50.820 --> 17:54.300
Way to bust out the
Jedi mind tricks, dude.

17:55.250 --> 17:57.030
I just want to make sure
that we're all clear.

17:57.050 --> 18:00.000
Standard robotic fighting
league rules apply.

18:00.010 --> 18:02.650
Are you cwazy? This is a stweet fight.

18:02.660 --> 18:04.830
The stweet has no rules.

18:04.850 --> 18:07.360
He's right, Leonard. The
paradigm is to the death.

18:07.370 --> 18:11.600
I will, however, give you the
opportunity to concede my superiority now

18:11.620 --> 18:15.030
and offer me your robot
as the spoils of war.

18:15.380 --> 18:16.530
Never.

18:16.560 --> 18:18.870
I'd rather see Monte
dead than in your hands.

18:18.880 --> 18:21.460
That could be easily arranged.

18:21.490 --> 18:23.150
Ready, set, go?

18:23.160 --> 18:24.410
Do it.

18:24.420 --> 18:28.790
All right then. Weady. Set. Go.

18:32.750 --> 18:33.900
Come on, Sheldon, you got this.

18:33.920 --> 18:38.310
Indeed. We are prepared for
anything he can throw at us.

18:45.110 --> 18:46.840
That's new.

18:46.850 --> 18:51.380
- Run, Monte, run!
- Go, Monte!

18:51.390 --> 18:54.490
- Monte!
- Go, go, go, go!

18:56.480 --> 18:59.460
Don't hurt us, don't
hurt us, don't hurt us!

19:05.020 --> 19:10.020
Well, so much for making up for
the emotional wounds of childhood.

19:11.210 --> 19:12.910
I did this.

19:12.920 --> 19:16.210
Monte was killed by
my hubris and my pride.

19:16.230 --> 19:18.530
No matter what anybody
says, this is my fault.

19:18.540 --> 19:21.050
No one's arguing with you, dude.

19:21.560 --> 19:24.490
I got your text. How bad is... Oy.

19:26.110 --> 19:29.150
Forget the robot. What happened to you?

19:29.520 --> 19:30.810
He slipped and fell.

19:30.820 --> 19:34.900
Yes, I slipped and
fell. In the bathroom.

19:35.150 --> 19:37.860
Bounced right off the tub.

19:38.210 --> 19:43.030
Yes, now he knows what bathtubs are capable of
doing when you don't treat them with respect.

19:43.040 --> 19:44.980
Yeah.

19:45.010 --> 19:48.370
They sucker punch you
when your eyes are closed.

19:49.520 --> 19:51.500
So what do you think, Howard?

19:51.530 --> 19:54.090
It's not that bad, right?

19:54.100 --> 19:59.040
Oh, no. A little electrical tape,
some solder... Are you insane?

19:59.050 --> 20:04.320
I've seen space probes that crashed into the
desert that were in better shape than this.

20:04.930 --> 20:08.080
You're right. Monte's gone.

20:08.090 --> 20:11.910
We'll bury him in the morning.
A simple ceremony. I'll speak.

20:11.920 --> 20:14.860
Leonard, you'll play your cello.

20:15.040 --> 20:17.180
Sheldon, honey, aren't you
getting a little carried away?

20:17.200 --> 20:20.190
I mean, it's just a toy robot.

20:21.780 --> 20:24.590
Just a toy robot?

20:29.640 --> 20:30.930
Penny.

20:30.960 --> 20:33.310
I know, I got it.

20:33.320 --> 20:36.730
Sheldon, I'm sorry.

20:38.690 --> 20:40.250
Well, don't get the wrong idea.

20:40.260 --> 20:43.510
The way I see it, I'm
halfway to pity sex.
