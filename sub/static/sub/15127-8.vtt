00:39.840 --> 00:41.910
Sergeant Artherton?

00:41.920 --> 00:44.390
Mr Drake -
he has fought Inspector Shine.

00:44.400 --> 00:45.800
He has.

00:47.240 --> 00:49.080
Did he...win, Sir?

00:52.640 --> 00:56.160
Councillor Cobden?
A word with you, if I might?

00:57.280 --> 00:58.950
A comment, if you will?

00:58.960 --> 01:02.030
On my purpose here?
You are welcome to it, Mr Best.

01:02.040 --> 01:04.470
I am set on the renovation of
St Paul's Wharfside.

01:04.480 --> 01:06.710
Oh, no, good lady.
I have a surfeit of those already.

01:06.720 --> 01:10.390
No. It's, erm, it's comment
on other matters I seek.

01:10.400 --> 01:15.750
Yourself and Detective Inspector
Reid, you have been friends long?

01:15.760 --> 01:17.590
We have interests that conjoin.

01:17.600 --> 01:20.950
Politicians and police -
it will ever be the case.

01:20.960 --> 01:23.550
I know, it's a sweet story.

01:23.560 --> 01:27.080
Yourself and Edmund Reid -
aligned for ever more...

01:28.280 --> 01:31.230
..on his night-time visits
to your offices.

01:31.240 --> 01:34.510
Conjoined good and proper,
I imagine.

01:34.520 --> 01:35.880
Ma'am!

01:41.160 --> 01:42.640
Oh! Good God, no!

01:48.440 --> 01:54.800
CROWD: Shine, Shine, Shine!

02:29.360 --> 02:31.470
The width of the cleft
is barely a millimetre

02:31.480 --> 02:34.390
through Mr Hinchcliffe's throat -

02:34.400 --> 02:35.990
cut clean through the windpipe,

02:36.000 --> 02:39.630
but the wound encircles
the neck entirely.

02:39.640 --> 02:46.030
So...piano or cheese wire,
most like. It's from behind -

02:46.040 --> 02:49.040
pull clean, hold tight.

02:50.080 --> 02:54.830
A man of strength and precision.
An all too recent murder.

02:54.840 --> 02:57.190
And one to which we must add
the investigation

02:57.200 --> 02:59.470
of this rotted array
of bone work.

02:59.480 --> 03:01.470
You ask me, the river's
the best thing for them.

03:01.480 --> 03:02.920
We must do what we can.

03:06.400 --> 03:08.990
Straighten up, now in to him,
body, body!

03:09.000 --> 03:10.360
Liver and kidneys!

03:13.440 --> 03:16.000
Don. Bennet.

03:22.640 --> 03:25.760
Jab! Jab! He is not without skill,
Artherton tells me.

03:27.240 --> 03:29.760
Head, body...
It is not skill he needs.

03:32.720 --> 03:34.800
Bennet, Mr Hinchcliffe...

03:36.080 --> 03:39.830
..now, the man who defrauded him,
the man who murdered him, perhaps,

03:39.840 --> 03:43.110
he sits in our cells
not ten yards from where we stand.

03:43.120 --> 03:45.880
Body, body! Jab, jab!

03:47.000 --> 03:49.360
May I show him to you? Cross!

03:55.640 --> 03:59.430
Nathaniel Hinchcliffe,
the man you cheated, Mr Werner.

03:59.440 --> 04:00.990
The man you say I cheated.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.310
His murdered body
lies in my dead room -

04:03.320 --> 04:05.710
ready to give up
the secrets of its death.

04:05.720 --> 04:08.870
Well, then that is where
you must find them,

04:08.880 --> 04:10.480
cos you'll get none from me.

04:11.840 --> 04:14.150
Have it from me, Reid,

04:14.160 --> 04:17.829
the look of disgust
on your face when you struck me?

04:17.839 --> 04:21.110
You lack the stomach
for another man's torment.

04:21.120 --> 04:25.360
Perhaps. But might I
introduce you to my friend here?

04:27.080 --> 04:30.310
His name is Drake.
Perhaps you have heard it spoken.

04:30.320 --> 04:31.750
I heard it, he was gone.

04:31.760 --> 04:33.360
As you can see, he is not.

04:35.960 --> 04:39.870
Now, Nathaniel Hinchcliffe,
you defrauded him

04:39.880 --> 04:42.080
and then you had
him murdered, did you not?

04:44.680 --> 04:48.320
What, Inspector?
Has your dog gone lame?

04:56.120 --> 04:57.230
Sergeant Drake?

04:57.240 --> 05:00.630
You have my warrant card, Sir.

05:00.640 --> 05:02.440
I've not taken it back.

05:03.520 --> 05:07.990
And so I am not your sergeant
to be bid no more.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.710
You retrieved
Hinchcliffe's broken body.

05:10.720 --> 05:13.150
That man in there, he will not talk
to me and I cannot...

05:13.160 --> 05:15.960
You cannot find it
in yourself to force him?

05:17.440 --> 05:19.470
No.

05:19.480 --> 05:22.600
And so once more require me
to do so for you?

05:25.640 --> 05:29.840
Inspector, I will not be
that man no more.

05:31.760 --> 05:34.110
I cannot.

05:34.120 --> 05:36.990
Do you not see what it
has brought me, Sir?

05:37.000 --> 05:39.680
Each lip I've fattened...

05:40.960 --> 05:44.550
..each head I've beaten against
steel bars, at your bidding.

05:44.560 --> 05:46.710
And you stood there in silence,

05:46.720 --> 05:49.680
waiting for their secrets
to pour forth.

05:53.120 --> 05:56.040
Inspector,
look at the ruins of our lives.

05:58.200 --> 06:04.910
Anyone we might...care for
or bring close to us, anyone!

06:04.920 --> 06:07.520
They suffer and we lose them.

06:09.520 --> 06:11.670
Do you think these facts
not related?

06:11.680 --> 06:13.710
No. That is
not the way the universe functions.

06:13.720 --> 06:17.190
There is no... There is no God,
stood in judgment.

06:17.200 --> 06:20.360
Who mentioned God, Sir?
No, I talk of life!

06:21.360 --> 06:25.520
And life, Mr Reid,
is offended by you and me.

06:38.040 --> 06:41.520
Mr Blewett? Mr Blewett?

06:44.720 --> 06:49.190
Mr Blewett? Is that my name
atop of tonight's bill? It is, Rose.

06:49.200 --> 06:52.430
And I hope to not receive
another visit from your friends

06:52.440 --> 06:55.440
and they now appreciate
the efforts I make for you.

07:01.960 --> 07:05.590
All my days, all of them,
whatever happens,

07:05.600 --> 07:07.670
I will always be grateful to you.

07:07.680 --> 07:09.390
Rose, please, hush.

07:09.400 --> 07:11.310
This is not to be laid at my door.

07:11.320 --> 07:14.040
But if it is not you
I thank, then...

07:16.920 --> 07:19.640
No thanks required. Erm...

07:23.800 --> 07:27.480
Nonetheless, Sir, you have them.

07:32.400 --> 07:34.990
Miss Rose.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.960
Susan, am I to wait in bed
all morning for my kippers?

07:42.200 --> 07:45.920
GENERAL MARKET HUBBUB

07:52.680 --> 07:55.870
That one there. Make it two.

07:55.880 --> 07:57.080
Thank you, Sir.

08:00.960 --> 08:05.400
Good day to you.
Lunchtime repast for you boys.

08:09.520 --> 08:15.870
Mr Judge, you may feel protected
by your familial relationship

08:15.880 --> 08:20.110
with this station house. But we are
both patient and watchful men.

08:20.120 --> 08:22.710
Should you try to sell
our diamond, Sir,

08:22.720 --> 08:24.110
we will have it from you.

08:24.120 --> 08:27.480
And that item recovered,
we shall then take your head.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.670
This will rile you.

09:07.680 --> 09:10.150
Then don't say it.

09:10.160 --> 09:12.880
Our father would have been
proud of your skill.

09:14.600 --> 09:16.360
Pleased that you put it to use.

09:26.360 --> 09:28.990
Our diamond...still
in there, then?

09:29.000 --> 09:31.590
Those shits in suits
still watch you?

09:31.600 --> 09:32.950
I think they're in love.

09:32.960 --> 09:35.750
Then it stays put.

09:35.760 --> 09:39.030
And I must hit you
for more spending.

09:39.040 --> 09:40.840
You want more money from me?

09:42.080 --> 09:45.870
Go to that cabinet, bottom-right
drawer, get yourself an apron

09:45.880 --> 09:48.390
and make yourself useful.

09:48.400 --> 09:52.960
Reach for something here - a
supporting opinion may be conducive.

10:08.120 --> 10:11.520
Mr Reid give it me,
to help me hunt for you, Bennet.

10:12.680 --> 10:14.720
He said I would return
it to you.

10:18.440 --> 10:19.960
And see, I have.

10:26.440 --> 10:27.800
You want coffee, girl?

10:35.000 --> 10:37.840
No, Rose, you, er...
you stay out here.

10:47.840 --> 10:50.790
I'm told there will be
scouts attending...

10:50.800 --> 10:53.070
from the West End playhouses.

10:53.080 --> 10:55.310
I worry, Bennet.

10:55.320 --> 10:57.830
I fear the song I am to
perform is not...

10:57.840 --> 10:59.960
That I don't sing
it very well.

11:01.440 --> 11:04.160
But it's fashionable...and comic.

11:11.160 --> 11:13.270
You must do what you
think best, Rose.

11:13.280 --> 11:15.150
If I was to do what...

11:15.160 --> 11:16.440
you thought best?

11:17.480 --> 11:19.200
I know no songs.

11:21.240 --> 11:22.840
But if you ask me...

11:24.800 --> 11:27.320
..you must use a song
that speaks to your heart...

11:30.000 --> 11:31.830
..and sing it from there, girl.

11:31.840 --> 11:36.030
Will you come to Blewett's?
Watch me?

11:36.040 --> 11:37.760
It would mean the world.

11:41.480 --> 11:43.160
Then I shall come.

11:56.360 --> 11:57.400
Constable.

11:59.120 --> 12:02.430
Is it true what the streets say?

12:02.440 --> 12:05.870
That Bennet Drake has emerged
from the pauper's pit

12:05.880 --> 12:08.950
with the body of
Nathaniel Hinchcliffe in his arms?

12:08.960 --> 12:10.000
It is, Mr Shine.

12:13.960 --> 12:17.390
And that body now lay
beneath the keen eye

12:17.400 --> 12:19.030
of Edmund Reid's American?

12:19.040 --> 12:20.320
In all likelihood.

12:28.160 --> 12:34.350
And I imagine...yours an opinion

12:34.360 --> 12:36.680
all Leman Street
would urgently hear.

12:48.400 --> 12:49.440
What?

12:51.240 --> 12:52.280
You kill me?

12:54.280 --> 12:55.640
I made you, son.

13:00.640 --> 13:01.680
What were you...

13:03.440 --> 13:07.480
..before Jedediah Shine
laid his eyes on you?

13:08.520 --> 13:10.080
I was a bad man when you found me.

13:12.480 --> 13:14.160
But you have since made evil of me,
sir.

13:37.360 --> 13:38.440
You see?

13:40.320 --> 13:41.360
I cannot be ended.

13:52.160 --> 13:54.150
Your brother is qualified
to assist you, is he?

13:54.160 --> 13:55.910
Our father - a doctor himself -

13:55.920 --> 13:57.750
enrolled us in
The University of Virginia

13:57.760 --> 13:58.910
to study medicine.

13:58.920 --> 14:00.950
Twink here lasted the course.

14:00.960 --> 14:02.310
I did not.

14:02.320 --> 14:06.110
So I can, er...approximate
a number of factors.

14:06.120 --> 14:10.990
Gender, age, time of death
and manner of that passing.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.310
From these? I said approximate.

14:13.320 --> 14:16.310
Number one - a lady,
and from the wearing on her teeth,

14:16.320 --> 14:18.110
I'd say she's past 50.

14:18.120 --> 14:19.950
Two and three, both men.

14:19.960 --> 14:22.150
Mr Two here, likewise past 50.

14:22.160 --> 14:24.230
Mr Three is a somewhat younger man,

14:24.240 --> 14:26.870
perhaps only recently advanced
into adulthood.

14:26.880 --> 14:31.160
Two, however -
well, he has a peculiarity.

14:32.400 --> 14:36.120
The bowing in the tibia.
The maxilla is enlarged.

14:37.720 --> 14:39.430
The man had Paget's disease.

14:39.440 --> 14:43.350
Paget's. That's the...misshapen
enlargement of the bones, is it not?

14:43.360 --> 14:45.830
You are a medical man yourself, sir?
He reads.

14:45.840 --> 14:48.190
You said you might hazard
a time of death. What? A month?

14:48.200 --> 14:51.080
The season and the year.
There's two factors to consider.

14:52.440 --> 14:56.350
Cartilage and the wasps.
Wasps?

14:56.360 --> 14:58.990
So we are to be led to the truth
by dead insects.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.040
Hey, without them, we're nowhere.

15:02.480 --> 15:04.430
That nest in the ribcage.

15:04.440 --> 15:08.270
Now the queen can only have built it
in the summer of last year.

15:08.280 --> 15:09.710
Not this past?

15:09.720 --> 15:12.870
She'd have flew out
and stung you on your nose.

15:12.880 --> 15:15.750
So it is the frost of the intervening
winter which has killed them.

15:15.760 --> 15:18.030
Summer of '89,
when she makes this body her home,

15:18.040 --> 15:19.630
it's already got to be
empty of flesh.

15:19.640 --> 15:22.880
So these are dead the spring of 1889?
Give or take.

15:26.360 --> 15:27.680
That's cartilage.

15:28.920 --> 15:32.310
In all three, you can find the same.
This cartilage not rotted?

15:32.320 --> 15:34.350
Breaks down slower
than muscle and tissue.

15:34.360 --> 15:36.470
It is then preserved
by the same winter chill

15:36.480 --> 15:38.110
that has killed the wasps. Quite so.

15:38.120 --> 15:42.270
Although Mr Three there
is somewhat better preserved.

15:42.280 --> 15:44.550
Suggesting what?
That he died a month or so later?

15:44.560 --> 15:46.840
That he was murdered a month
or so later.

15:49.120 --> 15:50.150
He has this correct?

15:50.160 --> 15:51.510
Hey, I wouldn't have picked it,

15:51.520 --> 15:55.630
but my brother is somewhat
conspiratorial by leaning.

15:55.640 --> 15:57.350
I am a man for patterns, Inspector.

15:57.360 --> 16:01.390
This here is the thyroid cartilage.
Lives right above the trachea.

16:01.400 --> 16:03.070
See these striations?

16:03.080 --> 16:06.190
They're minute -
less than a millimetre in diameter.

16:06.200 --> 16:09.230
But something very thin has cut
all the way through

16:09.240 --> 16:10.960
with very great intent.

16:12.240 --> 16:14.150
And these three share
the same markings

16:14.160 --> 16:15.550
as these preserved thyroids?

16:15.560 --> 16:16.830
They do. They do.

16:16.840 --> 16:21.990
The force and conviction with
which Mr Hinchcliffe was garrotted,

16:22.000 --> 16:24.070
it is an unusual feat,
is it not,

16:24.080 --> 16:25.790
for the incision to penetrate
so deep?

16:25.800 --> 16:29.310
It suggests an extreme relish
for the task, yes.

16:29.320 --> 16:31.750
And one might imagine
a similar...relish

16:31.760 --> 16:34.950
being brought to bear
on the thyroid cartilages

16:34.960 --> 16:36.310
of these cadavers.

16:36.320 --> 16:41.520
The same means of execution,
by the same hand? One may.

16:57.120 --> 16:59.000
Please sir, you are to arrest me.

17:01.800 --> 17:02.960
What charge?

17:04.319 --> 17:05.359
Flight?

17:07.560 --> 17:08.880
What charge?

17:11.599 --> 17:13.599
Accessory to murder.

17:16.040 --> 17:17.280
Whose?

17:19.800 --> 17:21.829
Whose? Mr Reid, no man curses
me stronger...

17:21.839 --> 17:23.480
You tell me, now.

17:30.400 --> 17:31.800
Nathaniel Hinchcliffe.

17:34.520 --> 17:35.560
Joseph Merrick.

17:38.560 --> 17:41.150
But, er...Joseph Merrick?

17:41.160 --> 17:42.350
But he fell asleep -

17:42.360 --> 17:45.510
he...he was asphyxiated
by the weight of his own body.

17:45.520 --> 17:50.470
He was asphyxiated...Sir,
and with the weight of himself also.

17:50.480 --> 17:52.270
But it was not he
who removed the supports.

17:52.280 --> 17:53.360
But you were there.

17:54.720 --> 17:57.920
You were outside. I was, Sir.

18:01.920 --> 18:04.560
Who? Who, damn you?! Who?!

18:06.080 --> 18:07.240
Who?

18:08.480 --> 18:09.520
Inspector Shine.

18:12.720 --> 18:14.880
How do you know this?
He sent me here.

18:16.960 --> 18:19.430
Knew you, Mr Reid, had your eyes
on his activities

18:19.440 --> 18:21.750
and knowing that you could find
no men to join you here,

18:21.760 --> 18:22.800
had me volunteer.

18:24.200 --> 18:26.200
I was sent here to spy on you, sir.

18:38.920 --> 18:40.510
Sergeant Artherton,

18:40.520 --> 18:43.070
throw that man in my office there
into a cell.

18:43.080 --> 18:46.880
yes, sir - on what charge, Mr Reid?

18:48.920 --> 18:49.960
Our betrayal.

18:54.480 --> 18:57.390
Reid!
Are you in command of yourself?

18:57.400 --> 18:59.670
Do you know what it is you do?
I know precisely.

18:59.680 --> 19:01.870
We wonder, do we not,
if those skeletal remains

19:01.880 --> 19:04.070
were taken by the same man
as killed Mr Hinchcliffe?

19:04.080 --> 19:08.270
Now, Flight's testimony gives me
Jedediah Shine for that last murder,

19:08.280 --> 19:11.350
but if I might name those corpses,

19:11.360 --> 19:13.990
discover their histories
and so join him with their deaths,

19:14.000 --> 19:15.390
then I can nail his coffin shut

19:15.400 --> 19:17.270
and put him in the earth
for all time.

19:17.280 --> 19:19.880
And so? Can you name them?

19:56.440 --> 19:58.990
KNOCKS ON DOOR

19:59.000 --> 20:01.670
Your timing is, as ever,
entirely apt.

20:01.680 --> 20:03.950
What might have been
scandalous gossip

20:03.960 --> 20:05.720
is now made fact.

20:07.880 --> 20:09.470
This journalist, Best -

20:09.480 --> 20:12.910
in due course, I shall see him
drowned in the northern outfall,

20:12.920 --> 20:15.230
but for now, I ask your patience.

20:15.240 --> 20:20.470
The three corpses that you discovered
in that Basin Slum tenement -

20:20.480 --> 20:22.550
they begin to give up their secrets.

20:22.560 --> 20:26.190
Secrets that may have great bearing
on the research I undertook for you.

20:26.200 --> 20:28.390
On the ownership structure
of the slum?

20:28.400 --> 20:30.800
The family which, until early
last year, owned the land.

20:32.240 --> 20:37.360
The Vere-Lyons.
It was theirs from the 17th century.

20:38.560 --> 20:39.830
The last descendents.

20:39.840 --> 20:42.270
The old man? Augustus.
He was disabled, was he not?

20:42.280 --> 20:44.270
His bones grown large and deformed?

20:44.280 --> 20:45.320
He was indeed.

20:47.440 --> 20:50.030
I believe his, one of the corpses -

20:50.040 --> 20:52.840
the others, therefore perhaps,
his wife and son.

20:53.880 --> 20:56.390
I believe them all murdered,

20:56.400 --> 21:00.310
and that in this documentation
lie the trace-marks

21:00.320 --> 21:02.270
of those who would gain
from that act.

21:02.280 --> 21:04.670
The concern,
who now takes ownership

21:04.680 --> 21:06.830
of the deceased family's holdings?

21:06.840 --> 21:08.160
Obsidian Estates.

21:09.400 --> 21:10.600
Indeed, yes.

21:13.120 --> 21:15.630
Here - April '89,

21:15.640 --> 21:18.750
the lands at St Paul's Wharfside
transferred to their holdings.

21:18.760 --> 21:21.950
Who is it hides behind their shield
of bailiffs and lawyers?

21:21.960 --> 21:24.440
They hide themselves
with some degree of skill, but...

21:25.800 --> 21:28.230
Here, Edmund.

21:28.240 --> 21:31.270
It is not solely
the Limehouse dockside

21:31.280 --> 21:32.840
into which Obsidian develops.

21:34.560 --> 21:36.750
It owns much of Whitechapel as well.

21:36.760 --> 21:40.000
These streets - the preserves of
opium dens and gaming houses and...

21:42.080 --> 21:43.120
..and brothels.

21:46.240 --> 21:47.480
Brothels.

21:48.960 --> 21:50.000
Edmund, wait.

21:51.280 --> 21:53.470
You seem as if all else is forgot.

21:53.480 --> 21:58.790
Jane, this, er...length of twine
that I follow,

21:58.800 --> 22:00.510
it pulls me towards evil men

22:00.520 --> 22:03.430
whose fell influence
is spread wide and deep

22:03.440 --> 22:05.320
across the parishes of east London.

22:06.480 --> 22:08.070
And I feel there the opportunity

22:08.080 --> 22:10.870
not solely to correct the darkness
of the world in which I serve,

22:10.880 --> 22:14.030
but also that which abides
in my own heart.

22:14.040 --> 22:17.630
And that baleful force
then eradicated,

22:17.640 --> 22:22.670
I might also find the strength
to...lead my own life.

22:22.680 --> 22:25.270
Seek my own happiness.

22:25.280 --> 22:29.560
And that strength being found,
I would seek it with you.

22:36.280 --> 22:37.520
Goddamn it. Where is he?

22:40.320 --> 22:41.760
Cheers.

22:43.160 --> 22:45.190
Daniel, this isn't your own
private residence.

22:45.200 --> 22:47.630
You can't be wandering about
the place like you own it.

22:47.640 --> 22:49.830
My brother can be an old woman
when he chooses.

22:49.840 --> 22:51.070
Ow!

22:51.080 --> 22:53.710
I told you -
Reid has him awaiting retribution,

22:53.720 --> 22:55.710
he is of no use to us.

22:55.720 --> 23:00.920
What is inside his evil, shiny dome,
however, that is of interest.

23:06.280 --> 23:07.320
Not here.

23:10.800 --> 23:13.270
Friend Werner tells of a man
he knows.

23:13.280 --> 23:15.430
A man of both sufficient
ready income

23:15.440 --> 23:17.190
and disregard for
commercial authority

23:17.200 --> 23:20.950
that may be persuaded
to buy such a rock. Who?

23:20.960 --> 23:24.990
Captain - I believe I have
these poor souls' stories,

23:25.000 --> 23:28.750
and you, perhaps, able to provide
their final chapter.

23:28.760 --> 23:31.470
These, I believe,
are the last of the line -

23:31.480 --> 23:34.670
the mortal remains of one of this
country's oldest landowning families.

23:34.680 --> 23:38.030
Their portfolio - vast estates
in rural Gloucestershire,

23:38.040 --> 23:40.150
a Regency mansion on Portland Place,

23:40.160 --> 23:44.510
and east London slum land,
from which rents are raised.

23:44.520 --> 23:49.950
Augustus and Clara Vere-Lyon

23:49.960 --> 23:52.790
and their only son, Stephan -

23:52.800 --> 23:56.230
Stephan who, in March of last year,
reports that his parents,

23:56.240 --> 23:58.630
due to the sake of his father's
health, are gone abroad.

23:58.640 --> 24:01.430
The old couple thus departed,
one month later,

24:01.440 --> 24:05.590
Stephan transfers his family's entire
holdings at St Paul's Wharfside

24:05.600 --> 24:09.350
into the ownership
of one Obsidian Estates.

24:09.360 --> 24:10.870
Then Stephan himself,

24:10.880 --> 24:13.030
promptly disappearing
from the face of the earth.

24:13.040 --> 24:15.150
And you think this is
all Shine's doing?

24:15.160 --> 24:17.600
To begin with, perhaps, yes,
I thought so. But, er...

24:19.560 --> 24:22.670
No, he is a man far too happy
inside his own evil skin

24:22.680 --> 24:24.110
to over-reach himself so.

24:24.120 --> 24:26.350
However, he is a Limehouse man,

24:26.360 --> 24:30.510
and this slum that Obsidian now owns
falling within his influence,

24:30.520 --> 24:32.390
he would make an exemplary associate

24:32.400 --> 24:37.630
for whichever vicious acts
of disguise and persuasion

24:37.640 --> 24:39.230
and enforcement may be required.

24:39.240 --> 24:41.390
And who is it makes him
this associate?

24:41.400 --> 24:45.190
I hoped you would provide
that information for me, Captain.

24:45.200 --> 24:47.120
Obsidian owns Tenter Street.

24:48.560 --> 24:50.840
You want to know who it is
leases to Susan?

24:52.320 --> 24:55.310
Yeah, it's, er...it's a man
named Duggan,

24:55.320 --> 24:57.870
he has a barber shop
over on Finch Street,

24:57.880 --> 25:00.840
he...resides there.

25:03.520 --> 25:06.630
He does not, Sir.

25:06.640 --> 25:09.120
Not any longer. Then where?

25:10.120 --> 25:11.840
I was going to tell you, Twink.

25:13.920 --> 25:15.360
Come!

25:16.400 --> 25:18.510
If only he realised
the depth of my deception.

25:18.520 --> 25:21.430
LAUGHTER

25:21.440 --> 25:22.520
Allow me.

25:31.840 --> 25:34.750
Mr Duggan, does your new bitch
not know to knock

25:34.760 --> 25:37.190
when gentlemen are at business?

25:37.200 --> 25:38.600
CROCKERY SMASHES

25:41.080 --> 25:43.240
Everybody out. Now!

25:51.640 --> 25:53.150
All I have done for you!

25:53.160 --> 25:55.270
And you would treat me
with such little respect

25:55.280 --> 25:56.910
in front of my associates.

25:56.920 --> 25:58.750
Do you know what I do
to those that insult me?

25:58.760 --> 25:59.830
Then do it to me, Duggan,

25:59.840 --> 26:01.630
because I may live like this
no longer.

26:01.640 --> 26:05.920
I have given to what you demanded
and so am obligated to you no more.

26:08.320 --> 26:12.160
And yet I cannot.
I know what covenant we had, madam.

26:13.400 --> 26:16.470
But another grows within me -
within my heart.

26:16.480 --> 26:18.600
I cannot be without you, dear Susan.

26:20.400 --> 26:21.560
Do you say that, what?

26:23.440 --> 26:24.680
That you love me, Sir?

26:27.440 --> 26:29.630
I believe I do, madam.

26:29.640 --> 26:31.310
If you say that you are mine,

26:31.320 --> 26:34.870
you may have every freedom
your heart desires.

26:34.880 --> 26:36.440
I swear.

26:39.960 --> 26:41.150
So he sleeps there!

26:41.160 --> 26:43.510
Plenty of men have laid their head
beneath that roof

26:43.520 --> 26:45.750
without doing so
on your wife's bosom.

26:45.760 --> 26:48.070
Daniel - not once in your life

26:48.080 --> 26:50.070
have you cared for any soul
other than your own,

26:50.080 --> 26:52.550
but try to understand - I love her.

26:52.560 --> 26:54.200
I need to kill him.

26:55.480 --> 26:56.830
Those are the rules.

26:56.840 --> 26:58.750
You kill him,
you remove from this earth

26:58.760 --> 27:02.150
the one person who has it
in their power to make us rich.

27:02.160 --> 27:04.640
It's him - Duggan.

27:05.960 --> 27:10.110
The man Werner believes
we might sell our stone to.

27:10.120 --> 27:14.470
Patterns, Twink - can you not see
how our stars align?

27:14.480 --> 27:17.870
The very man we must exploit
is both the quarry of your inspector

27:17.880 --> 27:20.910
and the enemy of your wife -
your wife, brother -

27:20.920 --> 27:24.590
who, whilst her..."lodger"
suffers Reid's questions

27:24.600 --> 27:27.150
can be visited and persuaded
of an entirely elegant logic

27:27.160 --> 27:30.110
that if Duggan can be made
to acquire this diamond,

27:30.120 --> 27:35.320
you and she may then repay him
with his own goddamn money.

27:40.920 --> 27:43.040
It is a fine story, Edmund.

27:44.520 --> 27:45.800
But your proof?

27:46.880 --> 27:48.270
Follow me, Fred.

27:48.280 --> 27:51.400
There is a bugbear of mine
I would return you to.

27:54.760 --> 27:59.680
Your testimony as described to me
by Edmund Reid - it is true?

28:00.760 --> 28:02.270
It is, Sir.

28:02.280 --> 28:06.280
I brought you here, God damn you.

28:07.440 --> 28:11.960
You volunteered to me
and I brought you here.

28:17.360 --> 28:19.790
And it is true -

28:19.800 --> 28:23.000
who you were in fact serving
at that time?

28:24.680 --> 28:25.720
Say it.

28:27.440 --> 28:29.800
I came to Leman Street
to spy for Jedediah Shine.

28:31.720 --> 28:34.440
I saw Jedediah Shine
murder Nathaniel Hinchcliffe.

28:36.200 --> 28:38.750
I waited beyond Joseph Merrick's
rooms... Enough!

28:38.760 --> 28:41.470
It is sufficient, is it not, Fred,

28:41.480 --> 28:44.110
to have Inspector Shine
brought to book?

28:44.120 --> 28:48.640
Come tomorrow -
you bring this man Duggan in.

28:50.720 --> 28:52.360
And I shall fetch the other.

29:01.240 --> 29:02.270
THUMPING ON DOOR

29:02.280 --> 29:03.870
Bennet Drake! You let me in

29:03.880 --> 29:06.040
or I'll set a fire
and smoke you out.

29:08.320 --> 29:12.750
Wainwright has promise,
and when timed correctly,

29:12.760 --> 29:15.720
his uppercut might punch holes
in steel.

29:22.800 --> 29:26.400
But he is young -
lacks in confidence.

29:28.320 --> 29:31.560
It would not hurt you
to come to the semifinal.

29:33.520 --> 29:35.950
Puff him up a bit.
You like this boy.

29:35.960 --> 29:38.190
I do.

29:38.200 --> 29:40.080
Then why is it you wish him to win?

29:41.240 --> 29:44.680
You know it is Jedediah Shine
awaits him should he do so.

29:49.040 --> 29:51.670
This life, Ben -

29:51.680 --> 29:54.910
all we may do is put one boot
in front of the other,

29:54.920 --> 29:56.400
may we not?

29:59.600 --> 30:02.440
CROWD CHEERS

30:08.400 --> 30:10.070
That's good, son!

30:10.080 --> 30:11.760
Again, again!

30:41.480 --> 30:42.960
Good lad - get down.

30:50.760 --> 30:52.680
Good boy! And again!

30:56.440 --> 30:58.150
Come on, ref, start counting!

30:58.160 --> 31:03.550
CROWD: Six, five, four,
three, two, one!

31:03.560 --> 31:06.510
CHEERING

31:06.520 --> 31:07.720
H Division!

31:09.320 --> 31:12.710
Welcome, Constable.

31:12.720 --> 31:15.600
I am a man of greedy anticipation.

31:16.600 --> 31:18.640
A greed for you, son.

31:19.920 --> 31:21.790
Let us hope you make
a better fist of it

31:21.800 --> 31:25.560
than the last finalist to arrive
from the Leman Street ranks.

31:31.120 --> 31:32.830
Chief Inspector.

31:32.840 --> 31:35.470
It is a while since you
partook of such sport.

31:35.480 --> 31:37.960
They have changed the rulebook,
Jedediah.

31:38.960 --> 31:41.510
My day, anything went.

31:41.520 --> 31:45.430
Had I fought you, I would have
carried a knife in my britches,

31:45.440 --> 31:47.870
and - in my current mood -

31:47.880 --> 31:50.680
used it to cut your knackers off.

32:06.320 --> 32:07.830
After you, Chief Inspector.

32:07.840 --> 32:10.080
No, Mr Reid - it is your shop.

32:18.240 --> 32:21.920
Sergeant Artherton,
have this man booked.

32:24.840 --> 32:26.840
Murder. Multiple counts.

32:28.400 --> 32:30.710
Mr Duggan, we are very grateful
to have you today.

32:30.720 --> 32:33.240
If you'll follow me,
we'll get you some tea.

32:37.600 --> 32:38.920
Name?

32:42.040 --> 32:43.320
Name?

32:50.520 --> 32:52.200
There you are.

32:54.840 --> 32:56.240
Obsidian Estates.

32:57.360 --> 32:58.720
A concern of mine.

33:00.280 --> 33:02.270
It's a large concern for a barber.

33:02.280 --> 33:05.990
Some days I'm a barber,
some days I pursue other interests.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.190
Ah.

33:07.200 --> 33:09.440
Are you a policeman alone,
Inspector?

33:12.160 --> 33:14.270
How is it Obsidian
came by its holdings

33:14.280 --> 33:15.750
at St Paul's Wharfside?

33:15.760 --> 33:17.270
The Basin Slum? Hm.

33:17.280 --> 33:19.510
It was yielded to me
by a young man -

33:19.520 --> 33:21.230
Stephan Vere-Lyon.

33:21.240 --> 33:24.230
Vast acreage of rented tenements,
yielded for a peppercorn.

33:24.240 --> 33:27.550
No, sir, no peppercorn -
repayment for a debt.

33:27.560 --> 33:29.430
Heavy debt.

33:29.440 --> 33:31.990
He was a miscreant libertine,
that young man.

33:32.000 --> 33:33.550
You were happy
to fund his pursuits?

33:33.560 --> 33:37.120
I do beg your pardon, Inspector,
but is this a moral debate?

33:38.200 --> 33:40.030
You may say what you like
about the ethics

33:40.040 --> 33:41.790
of my business practices.

33:41.800 --> 33:43.270
I broke no law of yours.

33:43.280 --> 33:47.950
I should, in all conscience,
congratulate you.

33:47.960 --> 33:49.270
No.

33:49.280 --> 33:53.520
You have concealed yourself
with great skill from my view.

33:57.560 --> 33:58.880
But I see you now, sir.

34:00.040 --> 34:04.120
Your lands extending from Whitechapel
to the Limehouse docks.

34:05.240 --> 34:08.510
Whatever you choose to buy there,
to sell, to distribute,

34:08.520 --> 34:11.429
all and everything aided
by your alliance with another man

34:11.440 --> 34:13.830
I currently hold
in this station house -

34:13.840 --> 34:16.030
Inspector Shine.

34:16.040 --> 34:17.440
I believe he murders for you.

34:19.239 --> 34:22.070
A family whose estate
you would absorb.

34:22.080 --> 34:26.310
A craftsman who tenaciously pursues
a long firm deception you sponsor.

34:26.320 --> 34:28.190
How do you expect to prove that,
sir?

34:28.199 --> 34:29.469
I can incriminate Shine

34:29.480 --> 34:31.550
and he, in turn,
can do the same to you.

34:31.560 --> 34:36.350
You seem a fine fellow, Mr Reid,
but I feel for you. I do.

34:36.360 --> 34:42.400
This force of yours is what -
a notch over 60 years of age?

34:43.760 --> 34:44.920
And this great city?

34:45.920 --> 34:47.190
Almost 2,000 years.

34:47.199 --> 34:49.760
So there - do you follow?

34:51.159 --> 34:56.870
This here - between you and I,
it is an uneven contest.

34:56.880 --> 34:58.630
Your roots are shallow, Reid,

34:58.640 --> 35:02.790
your laws improvised to fit a modern
world still in its birth pains.

35:02.800 --> 35:06.160
You say that I did fix one man
to cause another's death?

35:07.920 --> 35:09.240
Maybe I have.

35:10.560 --> 35:13.630
But you can't demonstrate that
as a fact.

35:13.640 --> 35:17.510
All you can do is bring witness.
One man's word against another.

35:17.520 --> 35:20.960
And words are unreliable signifiers
of the truth.

35:23.120 --> 35:24.880
Your world will advance.

35:25.920 --> 35:29.080
I am certain that men like yourself
will make sure of it.

35:30.320 --> 35:33.990
I will have returned to London clay
before that day dawns.

35:34.000 --> 35:38.550
Till then, you are a child.

35:38.560 --> 35:41.920
And I am a man of old stone.

35:48.800 --> 35:50.670
You will stay here.

35:50.680 --> 35:51.840
As you please.

35:53.280 --> 35:54.920
Chin up.

35:57.520 --> 36:00.280
You are to be released
from your purgatory.

36:01.640 --> 36:04.390
Gentlemen. I have been kept waiting.

36:04.400 --> 36:06.390
Other cattle to herd, Inspector.

36:06.400 --> 36:10.830
And now my time is come?
So let us cut to it.

36:10.840 --> 36:15.750
I do not believe I need go through
performances of astonished
outrage for you both.

36:15.760 --> 36:19.990
I am incarcerated here due
to your suspecting foul deeds of me.

36:20.000 --> 36:24.070
So, elaborate, Inspectors.

36:24.080 --> 36:28.000
And I shall offer...rebuttal.

36:36.760 --> 36:39.190
This man, he is known to you?

36:39.200 --> 36:41.520
He is indeed familiar to me.

36:45.600 --> 36:50.960
Yes. I remember all. Albert Flight.

36:52.960 --> 36:55.150
Irish.

36:55.160 --> 37:01.640
Sold gin, mixed with sulphur
and turpentine, did you not?

37:03.240 --> 37:08.320
Men and women went blind,
Inspectors. And here he is now.

37:10.000 --> 37:15.360
Reinvented as a CID man.

37:21.200 --> 37:25.600
Can you imagine the scandal, sir
if you bring this case against me?

37:28.640 --> 37:32.790
All accusations based on the word
of a poisoner who has

37:32.800 --> 37:36.560
successfully lied his way
into the Whitechapel police.

37:39.480 --> 37:42.830
What this man says,
there is truth in it?

37:42.840 --> 37:45.110
Please, Chief Inspector!

37:45.120 --> 37:47.720
He is no use to us dead.
No use to you alive, neither!

37:48.920 --> 37:51.270
Never mind your inevitable failure,

37:51.280 --> 37:58.430
but the glaring light you will
throw on our work, our livelihood,

37:58.440 --> 38:05.360
our uniform, the fragile position
we hold in this city.

38:14.680 --> 38:17.430
You were a Bloomsbury man -
you had a record.

38:17.440 --> 38:19.070
Those records were true, sir.

38:19.080 --> 38:20.710
But before then? You were this?

38:20.720 --> 38:27.030
The man I was, is...abhorrent to me,
sir. Forgotten.

38:27.040 --> 38:28.160
By you, perhaps.

38:29.320 --> 38:31.470
But your past has
guided your present.

38:31.480 --> 38:38.470
No, sir, the work I have done
for you, here. It was good work.

38:38.480 --> 38:45.640
And that work was proper work.
I fought to outrun my shame, sir.

38:47.040 --> 38:48.560
No man may do that, Flight.

38:53.960 --> 38:55.910
Am I to be detained here any longer?

38:55.920 --> 38:59.270
There is a championship final
for which I must train myself.

38:59.280 --> 39:01.510
And it is your man I face,
is it not, Inspector?

39:01.520 --> 39:06.680
What's his name? Wheelwright?
I do hope he's resilient.

39:08.080 --> 39:12.200
Men have died
in that roped ring before now.

39:18.720 --> 39:19.910
Mr Duggan.

39:19.920 --> 39:21.400
Mr Shine.

39:30.840 --> 39:32.080
Susan, hear me out.

39:39.080 --> 39:42.000
I came because I still hope to
save you from him.

39:46.440 --> 39:52.710
And so tell. How am I
to be rescued by you?

39:52.720 --> 39:54.630
The diamond.

39:54.640 --> 39:59.390
The diamond. The worthless rock
you have shown to me already.

39:59.400 --> 40:01.990
You may call it worthless,
but it's not.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.760
There are men that intend
to kill for its recapture.

40:06.880 --> 40:08.430
Kill who?

40:08.440 --> 40:10.190
My brother, myself.

40:10.200 --> 40:13.030
Then perhaps I should lead them
to you.

40:13.040 --> 40:16.310
No! No, no god damn it.
You love me still, I know it.

40:16.320 --> 40:18.350
I assure you I do not.

40:18.360 --> 40:20.910
This stone, it may be all

40:20.920 --> 40:23.550
and everything we need to get
clear of that sack of shit.

40:23.560 --> 40:24.640
Please.

40:26.120 --> 40:27.870
I have it on authority

40:27.880 --> 40:30.600
that Duggan can be led
to the purchase of this stone.

40:32.560 --> 40:34.190
Led by me, you imagine?

40:34.200 --> 40:36.600
The debt is then repaid
with his own money.

40:38.840 --> 40:43.160
Must I draw you
an anatomical sketch, husband?

40:45.360 --> 40:48.760
The debt is paid.
Try it.

40:50.720 --> 40:53.080
I have no more pain to be felt.

40:58.960 --> 41:01.040
There may yet be joy, however.

41:03.720 --> 41:06.990
Look, whatever it takes, darling,
till my blood be spilt,

41:07.000 --> 41:09.190
I will find what it takes
to make you smile again.

41:09.200 --> 41:13.080
Only allow it. Allow me the
opportunity, this opportunity.

41:15.720 --> 41:17.520
Joy is passing.

41:22.880 --> 41:30.400
Vengeance, however...that is
a pursuit for which I'd see
blood spilt.

41:35.120 --> 41:36.710
You say there are men of vicious

41:36.720 --> 41:39.200
and murderous intent
who wish to reclaim this gem?

41:41.560 --> 41:42.760
I do.

41:45.360 --> 41:49.070
Flight. He must feel the whip,
Edmund.

41:49.080 --> 41:50.600
Why, Fred? To what end?

41:52.280 --> 41:55.360
We may not strike at Jedediah Shine
or Silas Duggan through him.

41:56.800 --> 41:59.640
We may not strike at those men
at all. What, then?

42:01.240 --> 42:05.510
Say, imagine, we might,
you and I, walk into a chophouse

42:05.520 --> 42:08.470
on the Commercial Road
and in that chophouse we...

42:08.480 --> 42:13.150
lay our hands up on the shoulder
of the man the world made

42:13.160 --> 42:18.520
The Ripper, know him unequivocally
for that killer, what would we do?

42:20.160 --> 42:22.200
There is what I would like to do.

42:24.640 --> 42:26.960
And there is what I am permitted
to do.

42:28.040 --> 42:32.550
And so instead of pinioning his head
to the wall through his eyeball,

42:32.560 --> 42:37.830
we would show him our irons
then go about the process of proof.

42:37.840 --> 42:42.510
We would. I would.

42:42.520 --> 42:46.000
Evil men do as they please,
men who would be good...

42:48.080 --> 42:50.080
..they must do as they are allowed.

42:59.040 --> 43:03.960
I did not...wish to speak of it.

43:06.720 --> 43:12.120
But you must know, this, er,
matter with the Councillor.

43:13.800 --> 43:17.760
There are ructions at The Yard.
You a married man.

43:18.920 --> 43:21.440
I am to tell you to break it off.

43:22.960 --> 43:24.240
If I do not?

43:26.400 --> 43:28.480
Take your pension. Find other work.

44:00.760 --> 44:02.950
It is in the rough.

44:02.960 --> 44:04.240
And it is stolen.

44:05.480 --> 44:07.470
That is an impediment.

44:07.480 --> 44:09.830
Such fripperies cause me disquiet.

44:09.840 --> 44:12.310
I'm sorry, Susan,
but that is my sense of it.

44:12.320 --> 44:16.190
And I am sorry that you consider
£30,000 a frippery.

44:16.200 --> 44:19.430
Or is it myself you consider to be
nothing but your tinsel trapping?

44:19.440 --> 44:22.470
Madam, please, you know
that not to be true.

44:22.480 --> 44:24.430
Yet that is how I'm made to feel.

44:24.440 --> 44:27.070
The transaction is to take place
in a music hall.

44:27.080 --> 44:29.510
Enough. Is this all my life holds,

44:29.520 --> 44:33.190
for ever having to listen
to your cowardice and evasion?

44:33.200 --> 44:35.360
Will you furnish me with this gem
or no?

44:40.800 --> 44:45.190
The man Duggan, he knows you.
He hates you.

44:45.200 --> 44:48.110
He lays eyes on you, we may consider
the jig up.

44:48.120 --> 44:50.560
Which is why he must not
until the deed is done.

44:52.280 --> 44:57.200
So you are to meet he
and my wife where you exchange the
rock for the stipulated spending.

44:58.880 --> 45:01.510
They are now synchronised.

45:01.520 --> 45:02.550
Nine o'clock

45:02.560 --> 45:06.030
is the time you must be holding the
bag of bills and Duggan the diamond.

45:06.040 --> 45:07.510
You have me?

45:07.520 --> 45:11.510
I don't know, Twink.
You ask me, it's complicated.

45:11.520 --> 45:15.310
The jeweller, Finkel, betrayed you
to those De Graal bastards.

45:15.320 --> 45:17.630
We can count on him doing
the same favour to me.

45:17.640 --> 45:20.520
That betrayal enacted,
I will lead them to Duggan.

45:24.760 --> 45:27.150
As you can see, it's today's date.

45:27.160 --> 45:32.360
Whatever its provenance,
it is a jewel and I am a jeweller.

45:35.640 --> 45:37.550
I must see it, however.

45:37.560 --> 45:39.910
You bring it to me here. Here?

45:39.920 --> 45:41.070
Indeed.

45:41.080 --> 45:43.960
Not here, Mr Finkel,
some place I might feel safe.

45:57.280 --> 45:59.070
It is prepared?

45:59.080 --> 46:02.000
The full amount, madam. It is.

46:09.360 --> 46:11.640
CROWD MURMURS

46:27.000 --> 46:28.400
He cannot win, Mr Reid.

46:33.200 --> 46:35.710
Are you happy to watch
Jedediah Shine put him

46:35.720 --> 46:38.360
in the morgue for the pleasure
of 100 baying policemen?

46:40.160 --> 46:41.350
I am not.

46:41.360 --> 46:43.240
Then what are you prepared to do,
Sergeant?

46:46.040 --> 46:49.560
We wish to combat him.
It is all that is left to us.

46:54.760 --> 46:59.350
Lafone Cup provisions...
no man may be replaced

46:59.360 --> 47:02.520
unless in the event of
incapacitation through injury.

47:06.240 --> 47:08.030
You think it's best, Sergeant?

47:08.040 --> 47:09.680
I do.

47:11.360 --> 47:13.190
Do it, then.

47:13.200 --> 47:14.240
Drink this.

47:17.160 --> 47:19.350
I shall do it.

47:19.360 --> 47:21.160
Hold fast, son.

47:25.240 --> 47:27.600
HE SCREAMS

47:43.960 --> 47:47.390
Well, girl, do you wish to sing
or do you not?

47:47.400 --> 47:50.270
There is someone that I wait for,
Mr Blewett.

47:50.280 --> 47:53.640
Oh, you are waiting, are you? And yet
the house cannot wait for you.

47:57.480 --> 47:58.720
Here at last, then, are we?

48:02.760 --> 48:04.920
And so the men of H Division arrive.

48:14.720 --> 48:19.320
Must these assembled men go
un-entertained, therefore?

48:20.320 --> 48:21.480
They must not.

48:39.760 --> 48:41.920
Bennett Drake. Such sport.

48:47.040 --> 48:49.920
We are blessed!

49:03.960 --> 49:06.240
Boxers...

49:07.800 --> 49:10.270
..touch gloves.

49:10.280 --> 49:13.390
Sergeant, I have not
had opportunity to

49:13.400 --> 49:16.160
offer my sympathies
for the loss of your wife.

49:27.080 --> 49:29.750
Though it is said, at the point
of her death,

49:29.760 --> 49:32.400
she had returned to the
servicing of other men.

49:34.000 --> 49:36.390
Who's to blame you, therefore,
now that

49:36.400 --> 49:39.200
you seek comfort
with yet another...

49:49.720 --> 49:51.350
Ladies and gentlemen,

49:51.360 --> 49:53.510
I would ask you now to
give your full attention to

49:53.520 --> 49:58.910
the voice of gaiety,
Miss Rose Erskine.

49:58.920 --> 50:02.320
APPLAUSE
