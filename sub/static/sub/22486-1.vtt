01:24.252 --> 01:27.155
(dramatic music)

02:05.793 --> 02:06.760
- I'm guessing you're Dom.

02:06.794 --> 02:07.961
- [Dom] Yeah, hi.

02:07.995 --> 02:09.430
- Pat with Bay
Property Management.

02:09.463 --> 02:10.198
You ready?

02:14.468 --> 02:15.203
Entry.

02:18.138 --> 02:19.139
Living room.

02:25.045 --> 02:26.146
Kitchen.

02:27.548 --> 02:28.982
And I think you're
gonna love this.

02:31.685 --> 02:32.853
Washer and dryer

02:32.886 --> 02:35.155
and bathroom number one.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.159
- Oh, bathroom number one?

02:39.193 --> 02:41.662
- Number two's upstairs.

02:41.695 --> 02:42.830
- It's both floors?

02:42.863 --> 02:44.865
- Sure is, lots of room.

02:55.243 --> 02:56.877
Master bedroom.

03:04.418 --> 03:05.853
And bedroom two.

03:12.192 --> 03:13.727
- So how much?

03:13.761 --> 03:16.063
- 1300, utilities included.

03:16.096 --> 03:17.565
- Are you kidding?

03:17.598 --> 03:19.533
Oh, what? Does the Manson
family live on the other side?

03:19.567 --> 03:21.902
- No, I can assure
you no Manson family

03:21.935 --> 03:24.037
lives on the other
side. (giggling)

03:24.071 --> 03:25.239
It's vacant.

03:25.273 --> 03:27.841
It's getting its makeover next.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.377
But not for a while.

03:30.778 --> 03:31.579
So?

03:34.748 --> 03:35.549
- Yeah.

03:37.385 --> 03:38.519
(laughing)

03:38.552 --> 03:39.253
- Can you believe it?

03:39.287 --> 03:40.187
We actually did it.

03:40.220 --> 03:42.055
We have a real home.

03:42.089 --> 03:43.123
- Yeah.

03:45.125 --> 03:47.928
Let's finish this up.

03:47.961 --> 03:52.733
Then go christen
our new bedroom.

03:54.134 --> 03:55.369
- New?

03:55.403 --> 03:57.070
- You know what I mean.

03:57.104 --> 04:00.207
- It's still old even
though it has new paint.

04:00.240 --> 04:03.477
- What is it you don't like
about old houses anyway?

04:05.946 --> 04:06.747
- Just...

04:08.749 --> 04:10.250
I have my reasons.

04:11.118 --> 04:12.586
- Which are?

04:12.620 --> 04:13.754
- My reasons.

04:16.457 --> 04:19.259
(water splashing)

04:32.973 --> 04:36.176
(soft dramatic music)

04:40.448 --> 04:41.782
- Hey, Kristin.

04:42.650 --> 04:45.285
First night in our new house.

04:45.319 --> 04:48.356
(kisses smacking)

04:49.490 --> 04:52.460
(soft piano music)

05:05.839 --> 05:09.042
(soft dramatic music)

05:13.213 --> 05:16.149
(eerie whispering)

05:39.540 --> 05:42.309
You know, I was thinkin'

05:42.342 --> 05:44.344
new home, new beginning.

05:45.345 --> 05:47.314
Maybe now's a good
time for you to start

05:47.347 --> 05:49.550
weaning off the pills.

05:49.583 --> 05:51.719
- What's wrong with
taking a few pills?

05:51.752 --> 05:53.487
A lot of people do.

05:53.521 --> 05:54.988
They help with things,

05:55.022 --> 05:56.056
things that more fortunate
people don't have

05:56.089 --> 05:58.191
to struggle with.

05:58.225 --> 05:59.527
- I understand that.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.695
But sometimes anti-depressants
and sleeping pills

06:01.729 --> 06:04.331
have been known to
cause forgetfulness,

06:04.364 --> 06:06.734
apathy, hallucinations.

06:06.767 --> 06:07.668
- Dom!

06:07.701 --> 06:09.503
- Okay, I just care about you.

06:09.537 --> 06:10.838
Thought now was a good
time to talk about it.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.039
I guess not.

06:12.072 --> 06:14.074
- There's no it and
there's no discussion.

06:14.107 --> 06:16.243
It is with me, not you.

06:18.245 --> 06:20.247
Let's just drop it, okay?

06:24.552 --> 06:25.553
- I'm sorry.

06:28.456 --> 06:31.425
(kiss smacking)

06:40.934 --> 06:43.804
(soft piano music)

07:09.429 --> 07:11.431
(sighing)

07:11.465 --> 07:14.134
(dramatic music)

07:34.154 --> 07:37.024
(soft piano music)

08:12.159 --> 08:13.627
(dramatic music)

08:13.661 --> 08:15.128
What?
- Oh my God.

08:15.162 --> 08:16.463
What are you doing here?

08:16.496 --> 08:17.698
- I live here.

08:19.199 --> 08:21.835
(phone ringing)

08:26.039 --> 08:27.040
Hello?

08:28.341 --> 08:29.877
Hi, Mrs. Donahue.

08:31.044 --> 08:32.312
Mom.

08:32.345 --> 08:34.815
It's your mom, they just landed.

08:34.847 --> 08:37.851
I'm looking forward to
meeting you too, finally.

08:37.885 --> 08:38.719
Oh, great.

08:38.751 --> 08:40.187
We'll see you in an hour then.

08:40.220 --> 08:43.155
All right, here's Kristin.

08:43.190 --> 08:44.091
- Hi.

08:45.025 --> 08:47.494
Yeah, you're all here.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.196
How was the flight?

08:51.565 --> 08:52.900
(chuckles)

08:52.933 --> 08:54.367
Everything's all set up for you.

08:54.401 --> 08:55.736
Plenty of room.

08:58.538 --> 08:59.539
The place?

09:00.373 --> 09:01.541
It, it's nice.

09:05.545 --> 09:06.279
Yeah, why?

09:14.588 --> 09:15.789
Hold on a sec.

09:24.297 --> 09:27.567
(soft dramatic music)

09:31.238 --> 09:32.572
I don't know.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.709
It's probably just a
little stress from the move

09:35.743 --> 09:37.410
and all the rushing around.

09:37.444 --> 09:39.880
I'll be all right
when you all get here.

09:39.913 --> 09:41.548
- [Mom] Well, we're
about to get our luggage.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.216
I'll be there soon.

09:43.250 --> 09:44.084
- Okay.

09:45.919 --> 09:46.920
Mom?

09:46.954 --> 09:48.656
- [Mom] Yes, Kristin?

09:49.957 --> 09:51.258
- I don't know.

09:52.425 --> 09:53.593
A couple things.

09:57.497 --> 10:00.734
Mom, I think it's
happening again.

10:00.768 --> 10:04.672
- [Mom] You're still
taking your medications?

10:05.673 --> 10:06.740
(sighing)

10:06.774 --> 10:08.742
- Dom's been pressuring to
stop.

10:08.776 --> 10:09.743
- [Mom] Well have you?

10:09.777 --> 10:10.577
- No.

10:10.610 --> 10:13.113
- [Mom] Okay then, end of story.

10:13.146 --> 10:13.947
We'll be there soon.

10:13.981 --> 10:16.349
Everything will be fine.

10:18.018 --> 10:18.786
- Okay.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.924
(footsteps echoing)

10:23.957 --> 10:25.525
- [Mom] Hi, sweetie.

10:26.794 --> 10:28.328
How are you?

10:28.361 --> 10:29.429
(laughing)

10:29.462 --> 10:30.497
- [Kristin] Hi.

10:31.799 --> 10:35.135
- [Mom] Hi, oh, it's
so good to see you.

10:36.636 --> 10:40.507
(family talking in background)

10:45.545 --> 10:47.280
- She said you look
like a stripper.

10:47.314 --> 10:48.215
I wasn't...

10:49.683 --> 10:50.851
- Whoa.

10:50.884 --> 10:52.285
- Nice.

10:52.319 --> 10:54.454
- Well, it certainly
is big enough.

10:54.487 --> 10:55.488
- There's no in-between for us.

10:55.522 --> 10:57.157
We went from a shoebox to this.

10:57.190 --> 10:58.625
- Oh, what's the rent?

10:58.658 --> 10:59.960
- Katie Donahue!

10:59.993 --> 11:01.628
(laughing)

11:01.661 --> 11:02.963
It's absolutely gorgeous.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.998
The craftsmanship, the ceilings.

11:05.032 --> 11:06.967
- Yeah, great, great find, you
two. - Yeah.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.469
- Has the feel of
an old country home.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.705
- Oh! (laughing)

11:11.739 --> 11:13.040
- Oh, your brother's coming.

11:13.073 --> 11:14.641
He's driving down
from San Francisco.

11:14.674 --> 11:15.475
- Your brother?

11:15.508 --> 11:16.643
- Kevin's coming?

11:16.676 --> 11:18.145
- Did he get a job?

11:18.178 --> 11:19.146
- He didn't say.

11:19.179 --> 11:20.113
Come on, you two.

11:20.147 --> 11:21.414
Why don't you give us a
tour of the new place.

11:21.448 --> 11:22.649
- Okay.
- All right.

11:22.682 --> 11:25.018
(laughing)

11:25.052 --> 11:26.887
- I think you both found
a really nice place here.

11:26.920 --> 11:27.921
- Thank you.

11:30.357 --> 11:32.659
- Yeah, there he is.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.561
You're gonna need more
towels in the bathroom.

11:34.594 --> 11:35.362
- Got 'em.

11:35.395 --> 11:36.563
- Okay, perfect.

11:38.098 --> 11:38.899
Ooh.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.501
- [Mom] I'll have some
of that wine, please.

11:41.534 --> 11:42.569
- [Cindy] Okay.

11:45.438 --> 11:48.041
(dramatic music)

11:48.075 --> 11:50.710
(heart beating)

11:54.114 --> 11:56.784
(dramatic music)

12:00.053 --> 12:04.357
(family laughing in background)

12:04.391 --> 12:07.594
(soft dramatic music)

12:43.831 --> 12:47.467
(electricity buzzing)

12:47.500 --> 12:50.770
(light fixture clicking)

12:50.804 --> 12:52.239
(electricity buzzing)

12:52.272 --> 12:54.241
(light fixture clicking)

12:54.274 --> 12:57.644
(electricity buzzing)

12:57.677 --> 12:59.446
(light fixture clicking)

12:59.479 --> 13:00.747
(electricity buzzing)

13:00.780 --> 13:04.317
(light fixture clicking)

13:05.185 --> 13:07.955
(dramatic music)

13:10.623 --> 13:13.493
(glass shattering)

13:19.132 --> 13:22.002
(eerie whispering)

13:26.306 --> 13:27.140
- Kristin?

13:28.308 --> 13:30.643
(eerie whispering)
(dramatic music)

13:30.677 --> 13:31.711
You okay?

13:39.019 --> 13:40.153
- Yeah, I'm okay.

13:40.187 --> 13:42.856
Just, just too much in my hands.

13:50.163 --> 13:51.464
- Connecticut is where it's at.

13:51.498 --> 13:52.499
- Here's the difference.

13:52.532 --> 13:54.968
Back east every time
you go outdoors,

13:55.002 --> 13:56.503
you're hurrying to
get back indoors

13:56.536 --> 13:58.205
like three quarters of the year.

13:58.238 --> 13:59.539
- [Family] Oh.

13:59.572 --> 14:00.673
- Here, every time
you go outside,

14:00.707 --> 14:01.875
it's like, ah.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.912
(laughing)

14:05.879 --> 14:07.547
You okay?
- [Kristin] Yeah.

14:07.580 --> 14:09.716
- You know what? Fall, fall
is a good season for us.

14:09.749 --> 14:11.651
But hey, we get to
cuddle in the winters.

14:11.684 --> 14:12.719
- That's true.

14:12.752 --> 14:14.154
(laughing)

14:14.187 --> 14:15.989
- I think we need to open
another bottle of wine.

14:16.023 --> 14:17.324
- Oh no.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.159
- [Dom] Let's do that.
- let's do it! (laughing)

14:19.192 --> 14:20.493
- [Cindy] I'll get you some.
- [Bobby] All right.

14:20.527 --> 14:25.232
(engine rumbling)

14:38.878 --> 14:39.846
Yeah, that's true.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.881
- [Cindy] It is nice weather.

14:41.915 --> 14:42.950
- Hello?

14:44.051 --> 14:44.884
Hello?

14:46.619 --> 14:47.921
- Kevin!

14:47.955 --> 14:48.922
- Hey!

14:48.956 --> 14:51.524
- [Kristin] Aw, perfect timing!

14:51.558 --> 14:53.193
Dinner's ready.

14:53.226 --> 14:54.194
- [Bobby] No way.

14:54.227 --> 14:55.595
- [Kevin] Hi.

14:55.628 --> 14:56.563
- Been way too long.

14:56.596 --> 14:58.198
- Definitely, look at you.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.767
Still worshiping
the devil, I see.

15:00.800 --> 15:01.768
- I'm a good one.

15:01.801 --> 15:04.104
- Oh, sorry.
Hi Mom, how are ya?

15:04.137 --> 15:05.205
- [Mom] Great now
that you're here.

15:05.238 --> 15:07.040
- Bobby!
- [Bobby] Kevin.

15:07.074 --> 15:08.441
- Cindy!

15:08.475 --> 15:09.943
- Hi, I'm Dom.

15:09.977 --> 15:12.212
- So you're the one who's
finally bagged my big sister.

15:12.245 --> 15:12.946
- Ugh.

15:12.980 --> 15:13.746
(laughing)

15:13.780 --> 15:15.048
- [Mom] All right.

15:15.082 --> 15:16.083
Hungry?

15:16.116 --> 15:17.550
- Is that spaghetti I smell?
- [Mom] Let's eat.

15:17.584 --> 15:19.219
- Let's eat!
- [Bobby] Come on.

15:19.252 --> 15:23.090
- She was in the first grade
when she got the chicken pox.

15:23.123 --> 15:24.791
I felt terrible.

15:24.824 --> 15:28.895
She would just sit
there for entire days.

15:28.928 --> 15:31.798
Sitting in the bathroom sink
and staring in the mirror.

15:31.831 --> 15:33.633
- Yeah, at all
those horrible spots

15:33.666 --> 15:35.468
multiplying all over me.

15:35.502 --> 15:36.769
- Oh, so vain.

15:38.105 --> 15:39.572
- So one day I was walking
past the bathroom door

15:39.606 --> 15:41.108
and I felt so bad
for her, so I said,

15:41.141 --> 15:43.576
don't worry, baby.
They'll be gone soon.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.245
And she looks up at
me excitedly and says,

15:45.278 --> 15:46.479
"They go away?"

15:46.513 --> 15:47.314
(laughing)

15:47.347 --> 15:48.581
- Nobody ever told me.

15:48.615 --> 15:49.983
All I knew was kids were
disappearing from school

15:50.017 --> 15:52.085
and they weren't coming
back and I was next.

15:52.119 --> 15:52.952
- Aw.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.089
- She doesn't tell me anything
about when she was a kid.

15:56.123 --> 15:57.790
- She was always the
quiet, mellow one

15:57.824 --> 15:59.159
who'd sit on the
lawn chair and watch

15:59.192 --> 16:01.261
while the rest of us would play.

16:01.294 --> 16:02.595
Remember?

16:02.629 --> 16:04.164
- Pretty boring
chic you got here.

16:04.197 --> 16:04.964
(laughing)

16:04.998 --> 16:06.599
Kidding.

16:06.633 --> 16:07.800
- Well, I don't know
about everybody else,

16:07.834 --> 16:09.102
but I'm exhausted.

16:09.136 --> 16:11.304
All that traveling.

16:11.338 --> 16:13.540
- I'll get the beds ready.

16:22.182 --> 16:26.386
(eerie whispering)
(soft dramatic music)

17:04.857 --> 17:07.094
(scraping)

17:17.237 --> 17:19.239
- You hear that, right?

17:19.271 --> 17:22.175
(scraping)

17:22.209 --> 17:23.542
- What is that?

17:26.546 --> 17:27.780
- I don't know.

17:28.781 --> 17:30.850
- What is that noise?

17:30.883 --> 17:32.952
(scraping)

17:38.125 --> 17:40.093
- I don't know.

17:40.127 --> 17:40.927
- Go see.

17:44.131 --> 17:46.766
Oh. (sighing)

17:51.238 --> 17:52.439
Fine, I'll go.

17:54.107 --> 17:56.075
(slapping)

17:56.109 --> 17:57.244
- I hate you.

17:57.277 --> 17:59.479
(sighing)

18:10.457 --> 18:14.661
(soft dramatic music)
(scraping)

18:17.096 --> 18:19.766
(dramatic music)

18:19.799 --> 18:21.168
- [Mom] Oh my God!

18:23.803 --> 18:27.174
- Oh! (breathing heavily)

18:29.442 --> 18:30.477
- [Mom] Baby.

18:30.510 --> 18:32.078
- [Dom] Jesus Christ.

18:32.111 --> 18:32.845
- Why?

18:34.113 --> 18:37.116
(breathing heavily)

18:46.025 --> 18:47.294
Can you get me something
to sanitize these cuts

18:47.327 --> 18:48.795
and to wrap them?

18:48.828 --> 18:50.763
- We haven't gotten
anything like that yet.

18:50.797 --> 18:51.498
- Hang on.

18:51.531 --> 18:52.332
Katie.

19:02.809 --> 19:04.944
(trunk lid creaking)

19:04.977 --> 19:06.313
- Oh, gross.

19:06.346 --> 19:07.980
I'm not gonna find a body
or anything in here am I?

19:08.014 --> 19:09.282
- Yeah, yours.

19:09.316 --> 19:12.151
- Don't make me embarrass you.
- Uh!

19:16.689 --> 19:17.657
This is it.

19:19.058 --> 19:19.992
- EMT?

19:20.026 --> 19:21.928
Kevin was an EMT?

19:21.961 --> 19:23.129
- Yeah, Kevin's not
the type of guy that

19:23.162 --> 19:24.697
stuck with anything
very long, though.

19:24.731 --> 19:26.132
And Mom's a nurse.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.167
- Retired nurse.

19:28.201 --> 19:29.135
- Don't look at me, bro.

19:29.168 --> 19:31.504
I'm a professional husband.

19:37.076 --> 19:38.144
- [Mom] Do you have
gauze or something?

19:38.177 --> 19:40.146
- [Kevin] Yeah.

19:40.179 --> 19:41.781
- [Mom] Dom, will you put some
real good pressure on this?

19:41.814 --> 19:42.549
- Yeah.

19:54.761 --> 19:57.029
(sighing)

20:04.537 --> 20:07.240
(dramatic music)

20:12.211 --> 20:15.081
(drywall cracking)

20:25.458 --> 20:28.227
(dramatic music)

20:51.284 --> 20:52.952
- And I meet this girl, right?

20:52.985 --> 20:55.221
And she takes me
back to her place.

20:55.254 --> 20:56.623
And I'm like, look, no
matter what happens,

20:56.656 --> 20:59.058
you need to get
me home by 6:00am,

20:59.091 --> 21:00.893
'cause you know, 6:00
is my mom's alarm,

21:00.927 --> 21:02.228
goes off to go to
work and she'll think

21:02.261 --> 21:04.130
I was home sleepin'
the whole time.

21:04.163 --> 21:05.598
And I'm in college
at this point.

21:05.632 --> 21:07.266
I didn't want her to think
I was still a fuck up.

21:07.300 --> 21:08.901
(laughing)

21:08.935 --> 21:10.903
And then she gets me home
by the skin of my teeth,

21:10.937 --> 21:12.104
and I'm like a ninja, right?

21:12.138 --> 21:14.407
I open the door stealthfully,

21:14.441 --> 21:16.309
I kick off my boots.

21:16.343 --> 21:18.645
And I am in my
door, shutting it,

21:18.678 --> 21:20.580
right as her alarm goes off.

21:20.613 --> 21:23.149
Next morning I wake
up like noon-ish,

21:23.182 --> 21:25.284
and Mom comes home for lunch.

21:25.318 --> 21:28.287
She's like, "You think you're
pretty clever, don't you?"

21:28.321 --> 21:29.322
I say, yeah.

21:30.857 --> 21:32.792
She's like, "Why don't you go
take a look at your boots?"

21:32.825 --> 21:35.762
So I go to the front
door and there are

21:35.795 --> 21:38.665
my black boots right
where I left them,

21:38.698 --> 21:40.933
except smokin' hot
girl's bright pink bra

21:40.967 --> 21:42.268
is hanging out of one of 'em.

21:42.301 --> 21:43.770
(laughing)

21:43.803 --> 21:45.104
And Mom says...

21:45.137 --> 21:46.673
- Have fun out
with your friends?

21:46.706 --> 21:48.441
- Uh, I was so close!

21:48.475 --> 21:49.175
(laughing)

21:49.208 --> 21:50.309
So close.

21:51.310 --> 21:53.346
Anybody else got
a story like that?

21:53.380 --> 21:54.481
Bobby, I know you do.

21:54.514 --> 21:56.649
- Uh, he better not, yes.

21:56.683 --> 21:57.784
- Ah.

21:57.817 --> 22:00.319
(laughing)

22:00.353 --> 22:02.321
(soft dramatic music)

22:02.355 --> 22:04.624
- It was hidden in the
wall of the closet.

22:04.657 --> 22:06.493
Where you were last night.

22:06.526 --> 22:08.528
- You found that

22:08.561 --> 22:09.829
in your sleep?

22:11.531 --> 22:13.132
- Kristin, oh my God, how?

22:13.165 --> 22:16.503
- [Dom] I mean, did
you know it was there?

22:18.871 --> 22:20.006
- No.

22:20.907 --> 22:22.141
- What's in it?

22:22.174 --> 22:23.309
It looks old.

22:23.342 --> 22:25.878
- Yeah, probably as
old as this house.

22:25.912 --> 22:26.979
- Are you gonna open it?

22:27.013 --> 22:28.047
- I don't know,
maybe we shouldn't.

22:28.080 --> 22:29.716
- [Katie] Or maybe we should.

22:29.749 --> 22:30.650
- Yeah.

22:30.683 --> 22:31.651
- Mmm-hmm.

22:31.684 --> 22:32.885
- You found it.

22:32.919 --> 22:34.687
Do you wanna know?

22:36.255 --> 22:37.390
- Oh, open it.

22:41.027 --> 22:43.763
- It's like some
sort of medical.

22:44.931 --> 22:48.200
(soft dramatic music)

22:51.538 --> 22:52.271
Whoa.

22:55.608 --> 22:56.409
- Holy...

23:07.420 --> 23:09.388
Okay, if this is what they
used on people back then

23:09.422 --> 23:11.357
I'm glad I wasn't around.

23:11.390 --> 23:13.560
- [Kevin] Well, this
was never standard med.

23:13.593 --> 23:14.894
- What is this?

23:16.228 --> 23:17.363
Sedatives?

23:17.396 --> 23:18.264
Chloroform?

23:19.566 --> 23:21.033
Morphine?

23:21.067 --> 23:23.436
- That's some
pretty heavy stuff.

23:23.470 --> 23:24.270
Ooh.

23:31.778 --> 23:33.580
- [Dom] What are you doing?

23:33.613 --> 23:36.215
- Her and her friends are
into this new age stuff.

23:36.248 --> 23:37.584
I really wish you
wouldn't, Katie.

23:37.617 --> 23:40.419
- You seriously had no idea
that this was in there?

23:40.453 --> 23:41.754
- I was asleep.

23:45.492 --> 23:46.759
I don't know how.

23:51.598 --> 23:55.267
- I need to talk to my
sister for a second.

23:58.337 --> 23:59.606
Just a second.

24:08.447 --> 24:10.316
- Honey, what's going on?

24:10.349 --> 24:12.685
- Honestly, I have no idea.

24:16.789 --> 24:19.291
- Hey, don't look at me, man.

24:21.460 --> 24:23.095
This isn't new, though.

24:23.129 --> 24:25.297
They've always had some weird

24:25.331 --> 24:27.099
thing between them.

24:27.133 --> 24:28.267
- Like what?

24:28.300 --> 24:29.435
With Kristin?

24:29.468 --> 24:30.637
- Yeah.

24:30.670 --> 24:32.939
But believe me, you
don't want to go there.

24:32.972 --> 24:35.842
They can get pretty
pissy about it.

24:42.314 --> 24:43.449
- She hasn't told him.

24:43.482 --> 24:44.483
- You? No?

24:45.552 --> 24:46.352
- No.

24:48.521 --> 24:51.123
- So we're the only
ones that know still?

24:51.157 --> 24:52.158
To this day?

24:55.528 --> 24:58.297
How is it happening again?

24:58.330 --> 25:00.499
(sighing)

25:02.869 --> 25:04.170
- I don't know.

25:05.337 --> 25:08.207
(soft synth music)

25:22.855 --> 25:24.490
- Hey.

25:24.523 --> 25:26.158
What you up to?

25:26.192 --> 25:28.060
- [Katie] Energy reading.

25:28.094 --> 25:28.895
- Oh.

25:30.429 --> 25:31.698
Anything good?

25:37.236 --> 25:38.037
- No.

25:43.375 --> 25:44.110
- Dom.

25:45.211 --> 25:45.945
Dom, eat.

25:47.113 --> 25:48.347
- I am.

25:48.380 --> 25:50.516
Just want to see if I can find
a name or something on here.

25:50.549 --> 25:52.752
Learn something about this bag.

25:52.785 --> 25:53.720
- Dom, come on.

25:53.753 --> 25:54.887
We're all together.

25:54.921 --> 25:56.388
Let's just put this
away and let's be happy

25:56.422 --> 25:57.523
visiting with one another.

25:57.556 --> 25:59.525
(book thudding)
(soft dramatic music)

25:59.558 --> 26:01.560
- Whoa, that's trippy.

26:04.897 --> 26:06.232
- What is that?

26:11.738 --> 26:13.940
- [Dom] It's some
sort of journal.

26:13.973 --> 26:14.941
- [Cindy] Hey, one.

26:14.974 --> 26:16.242
- Yeah, hello?

26:18.577 --> 26:19.545
- Okay, hold on.

26:19.578 --> 26:20.546
First entry.

26:20.579 --> 26:22.081
October 19, 1923.

26:23.082 --> 26:25.551
My name is Dr. Jonah Falkhar.

26:25.584 --> 26:27.553
As of today I've
begun the first phase

26:27.586 --> 26:29.555
of my experiments
with human captivity

26:29.588 --> 26:32.058
and its effects
on human behavior.

26:32.091 --> 26:33.559
My flock, as I call them,

26:33.592 --> 26:35.628
are six young people
that I've gone out,

26:35.662 --> 26:38.731
used chloroform and other means
to abduct back to the house

26:38.765 --> 26:41.233
I've acquired to carry
out my experiments.

26:41.267 --> 26:42.969
- Okay, so this guy
kidnapped six people

26:43.002 --> 26:44.937
and brought them here?

26:44.971 --> 26:47.674
- That was a hundred years ago.

26:50.442 --> 26:51.610
- This is what you found?

26:51.644 --> 26:53.746
- I didn't know I
was finding anything.

26:53.780 --> 26:55.281
- [Katie] What else does it say?

26:55.314 --> 26:56.582
- Yeah, read some more.

26:56.615 --> 26:57.483
- Uh, okay.

26:58.617 --> 27:01.287
I keep each flock member
locked in separate

27:01.320 --> 27:02.588
parts of the house,

27:02.621 --> 27:04.957
always in complete
isolation from one another.

27:04.991 --> 27:06.759
I feel it's important
to thoroughly

27:06.793 --> 27:09.495
establish my relation
and status to each first.

27:09.528 --> 27:11.597
The feeling of total
isolation is crucial,

27:11.630 --> 27:13.632
as my experiments are
for the sole purpose

27:13.666 --> 27:15.935
of understanding the
emotional and psychological

27:15.968 --> 27:18.104
shifts that come with
the sense of attachment

27:18.137 --> 27:20.606
or detachment,
depending on how I,

27:20.639 --> 27:21.774
their captor, treat them.

27:21.808 --> 27:24.610
- [Bobby] Yeah, what the fuck.
- Psycho.

27:24.643 --> 27:25.778
- Oh, look, look.

27:25.812 --> 27:26.979
There's sketches right
here in the back.

27:27.013 --> 27:28.147
Six sketches.

27:33.052 --> 27:34.854
They're just numbered.

27:35.822 --> 27:38.457
They only seem to be
described in here as numbers.

27:38.490 --> 27:40.793
- A sick mind would do
something like this.

27:40.827 --> 27:43.662
Dehumanizes the victims.

27:43.696 --> 27:45.464
(dramatic music)

27:45.497 --> 27:47.633
(gasping)

27:47.666 --> 27:50.536
(dramatic music)

27:53.706 --> 27:55.808
- All right, maybe
someone or something

27:55.842 --> 27:57.476
doesn't want us reading it.

27:57.509 --> 27:58.544
- [Cindy] Yeah.

27:59.846 --> 28:02.715
- [Mom] Let's put
this away for now.

28:02.749 --> 28:05.251
- I'll go check the breakers.

28:17.596 --> 28:18.697
Hey.

28:19.698 --> 28:20.767
Weird, huh?

28:22.902 --> 28:26.505
You diggin' that
out of the closet.

28:26.538 --> 28:28.875
Somehow you knew it was there.

28:30.376 --> 28:31.210
Did you?

28:32.544 --> 28:33.712
- [Kristin] Hmm?

28:36.783 --> 28:38.717
- Did you take your pills?

28:38.751 --> 28:40.186
- Mmm.

28:40.219 --> 28:40.953
- Kristin?

28:43.790 --> 28:47.026
- Told you I didn't
like old houses.

28:47.059 --> 28:47.794
- Why?

28:49.896 --> 28:51.097
Why don't you?

28:53.232 --> 28:53.966
Kristin?

29:05.978 --> 29:06.779
- Uh-huh.

29:12.618 --> 29:14.086
Old.

29:14.120 --> 29:14.921
Very old.

29:15.922 --> 29:18.257
- What does that mean?

29:18.290 --> 29:21.393
- Well, you have knob and
tube wiring in this house.

29:21.427 --> 29:25.631
It was commonly used from
about 1880 to the 1930s.

29:25.664 --> 29:27.733
Doesn't work well today.

29:27.766 --> 29:30.069
- So that explains the
power surge last night?

29:30.102 --> 29:31.670
- Without a doubt.

29:32.839 --> 29:36.475
What you've got in here
predates the 1930s.

29:36.508 --> 29:38.644
Problem is, while this
wiring was adequate

29:38.677 --> 29:42.748
to handle the electrical loads
at the time of installation,

29:42.781 --> 29:46.685
it lacks the ampacity to
handle today's power use.

29:48.687 --> 29:51.090
Basically we have a
lot more appliances

29:51.123 --> 29:53.792
in a household nowadays
when than we did back when.

29:53.826 --> 29:56.963
- Yeah, we do 'cause
we've got the...

29:58.364 --> 29:59.165
- Whoa.

30:01.033 --> 30:03.435
- So what's the bottom line?

30:03.469 --> 30:05.104
- Everything seems normal.

30:05.137 --> 30:06.939
Just really old. (chuckles)

30:06.973 --> 30:08.674
- Everything but the paint.

30:08.707 --> 30:10.809
- I'm tying a few things down.

30:10.843 --> 30:12.945
May work out, may not.

30:12.979 --> 30:14.680
Just don't use the
toaster, the microwave,

30:14.713 --> 30:16.782
and the A/C all
at the same time.

30:16.815 --> 30:18.450
Especially if they're
on the same circuit

30:18.484 --> 30:19.785
as the refrigerator.

30:19.818 --> 30:21.487
(laughing)

30:21.520 --> 30:22.321
- Thanks.

30:23.189 --> 30:25.391
(sighing)

30:27.326 --> 30:28.460
- So this trip
turned out a little

30:28.494 --> 30:31.163
differently than expected.

30:31.197 --> 30:31.998
- Yeah.

30:34.833 --> 30:37.336
- Dom seems like a great guy.

30:38.204 --> 30:39.538
- Oh, Mom, I'm really
not trying to make

30:39.571 --> 30:41.140
things complicated for him.

30:41.173 --> 30:42.474
I'm just trying to
find the right time

30:42.508 --> 30:45.144
to bring up something
like why I'm taking pills.

30:45.177 --> 30:46.812
I know I should tell
him but I don't want

30:46.845 --> 30:48.647
to shock him with the
whole family here,

30:48.680 --> 30:51.650
and he's gonna feel surrounded.

30:51.683 --> 30:53.685
- What, by your
allies? (laughing)

30:53.719 --> 30:56.722
(dramatic music)

30:56.755 --> 30:58.490
You all right?

30:58.524 --> 31:00.859
- Just really weird right now.

31:02.594 --> 31:03.862
- Wanna go in?

31:04.897 --> 31:05.932
Okay.

31:09.701 --> 31:10.536
Come on.

31:12.939 --> 31:13.872
Here we go.

31:15.107 --> 31:16.008
- [Kristin] Ah!

31:16.042 --> 31:17.776
- Kristin, Kristin.

31:18.710 --> 31:21.180
Come on, baby, come on.

31:21.213 --> 31:22.848
Come on, baby.

31:22.881 --> 31:24.016
Come on.

31:24.050 --> 31:26.919
Come on, let's just
get you inside.

31:29.055 --> 31:30.722
Come on, baby.

31:30.756 --> 31:32.959
(moaning)

31:38.764 --> 31:39.565
Hello?

31:42.768 --> 31:43.802
Hello?

31:44.603 --> 31:47.573
(eerie whispering)

31:53.912 --> 31:55.081
Kristin?

32:06.959 --> 32:08.995
What, you're okay now?

32:19.605 --> 32:20.973
- What's going on?

32:22.308 --> 32:23.976
- Everything's good.

32:24.010 --> 32:25.311
What are you up to?

32:25.344 --> 32:27.579
- Oh, just checking out
the hall and the closet.

32:27.613 --> 32:29.248
Nothing else in there.

32:29.281 --> 32:32.918
What was all that yelling
when you guys came in?

32:32.951 --> 32:36.422
- We were just
seeing who was here.

32:36.455 --> 32:38.590
(inhaling deeply)

32:38.624 --> 32:39.958
- Are you okay?

32:40.826 --> 32:42.094
- Yeah.

32:42.128 --> 32:43.595
I feel fine.

32:43.629 --> 32:45.998
Just got a little dizzy.

32:46.032 --> 32:47.666
Where is everyone?

32:52.804 --> 32:54.306
- Out for a drive.

32:54.340 --> 32:57.109
Are you sure you're okay?

32:57.143 --> 32:57.976
- Everything's good.

32:58.010 --> 32:59.711
Couldn't be better.

33:04.050 --> 33:07.019
(soft dramatic music)

33:13.825 --> 33:15.394
- November 30, 1923.

33:17.363 --> 33:18.964
It's been over a month
and I'm observing

33:18.997 --> 33:20.866
a phenomenon that
is both as difficult

33:20.899 --> 33:23.969
to understand as
it is fascinating.

33:24.002 --> 33:25.471
I've stripped each
of my flock of all

33:25.504 --> 33:27.039
forms of independence...

33:27.073 --> 33:28.540
- [Jonah] And I'm in full
control of their lives

33:28.574 --> 33:31.310
as well as their base
needs for survival.

33:31.343 --> 33:34.813
I've starved them until they
cry like infants for food.

33:34.846 --> 33:36.848
I constantly remind
each of them that I can

33:36.882 --> 33:38.484
kill them at any
given moment if they

33:38.517 --> 33:40.652
give me reason to.

33:40.686 --> 33:42.188
I torture them in
horrible ways with

33:42.221 --> 33:44.490
my surgical instruments.

33:44.523 --> 33:47.826
There are times I
inflict ungodly pain.

33:47.859 --> 33:49.861
Other times I show kindness.
- And I'm observing

33:49.895 --> 33:54.032
a paradoxical
psychological phenomenon.

33:54.066 --> 33:57.203
- [Jonah] My
captives, the flock,

33:57.236 --> 33:59.771
seem to no longer despise me.

34:01.407 --> 34:04.610
(soft dramatic music)

34:06.912 --> 34:08.013
- But are beginning
to exhibit signs

34:08.045 --> 34:09.880
of a positive
attachment towards me.

34:09.915 --> 34:12.884
(dramatic music)

34:13.885 --> 34:16.455
(door creaking)

34:19.625 --> 34:20.859
- [Jonah] It is as
though they believe

34:20.891 --> 34:24.029
I am the one giving them life.

34:24.062 --> 34:26.697
(chains clanking)

34:26.732 --> 34:29.368
- By simply not
taking it from them.

34:29.400 --> 34:31.902
- What, does this guy think
he's God or something?

34:31.937 --> 34:33.871
- This guy's gotta be punished.

34:33.905 --> 34:35.241
- That thing's freaking me out.

34:35.274 --> 34:36.375
Can we put it away for tonight?

34:36.408 --> 34:37.443
- What?

34:37.476 --> 34:38.944
No way.

34:38.976 --> 34:42.880
- Yeah, it's better than just
staring at the TV, right?

34:42.914 --> 34:44.250
- Maybe Kristin's right.

34:44.283 --> 34:45.884
- Oh, come on.

34:45.917 --> 34:47.719
I want to see if psycho
doctor got away with it.

34:47.753 --> 34:48.887
- Yeah, me too.

34:48.920 --> 34:51.257
Here, why don't you tell us?

34:53.091 --> 34:54.260
- [Mom] Katie?

34:55.261 --> 34:57.094
- February 15, 1924.

34:58.430 --> 35:01.933
Today I mistakenly let two
see a glance of each other

35:01.967 --> 35:03.969
as I led number one, a female...

35:04.002 --> 35:06.572
- [Jonah] Past the upstairs
bath where number four,

35:06.605 --> 35:09.007
Lamelle, was kept in chains.

35:10.176 --> 35:12.077
I accidentally left
number four's door ajar

35:12.110 --> 35:13.945
and as I led number one past,

35:13.979 --> 35:17.183
I noticed them catch
each other's eye.

35:22.288 --> 35:25.457
(soft dramatic music)

35:45.177 --> 35:47.379
(moaning)

36:20.346 --> 36:22.748
(screaming)

36:26.518 --> 36:30.222
I had her in the next
room for over an hour.

36:30.256 --> 36:31.557
When I finished with
her I let her back

36:31.590 --> 36:33.825
past number four's door again.

36:33.859 --> 36:36.862
I noticed from him
a saddened glare.

36:39.064 --> 36:43.101
Possibly from hearing what I
was doing with her in there.

36:45.704 --> 36:48.874
I will experiment
with these two.

36:48.907 --> 36:50.008
See what sort of bonds...

36:50.041 --> 36:52.878
- Can form during captivity.

36:52.911 --> 36:56.047
- This is just, is this
really how we want to be

36:56.081 --> 36:57.215
spending our time together?

36:57.249 --> 36:58.884
Reading this terrible book?

36:58.917 --> 37:00.051
- At least there's
answers in there.

37:00.085 --> 37:03.054
I mean, nobody else
is saying anything.

37:03.088 --> 37:04.022
Like, you found
this in the wall.

37:04.055 --> 37:06.425
Wouldn't you like to learn?

37:09.094 --> 37:11.530
You know what I'd like to learn?

37:11.563 --> 37:15.066
I'd like to learn a little
bit more about my fiance.

37:15.100 --> 37:16.868
Like what's this big
secret the three of you

37:16.902 --> 37:19.070
won't share with the rest of us.

37:20.406 --> 37:22.708
I mean, aren't the three of
you just the least bit curious?

37:22.741 --> 37:24.209
- I am.
- Yeah, but--

37:24.242 --> 37:26.612
- Hey, I already told ya.

37:26.645 --> 37:28.046
It's become one of those
things where if you

37:28.079 --> 37:30.282
don't want to tell
us, then screw ya.

37:30.316 --> 37:32.117
- Katie Donahue.

37:32.150 --> 37:33.919
- I mean metaphorically.

37:33.952 --> 37:36.722
I don't mean it personally
or anything, like eff you,

37:36.755 --> 37:38.890
but I mean, that's
basically what you three

37:38.924 --> 37:40.792
have been saying to
us our entire lives

37:40.826 --> 37:43.261
with your exclusiveness.

37:43.295 --> 37:45.096
- Well, I want to know.

37:45.130 --> 37:47.766
I mean, I think we
deserve to know.

37:47.799 --> 37:49.568
We're a family.

37:49.601 --> 37:51.069
This is what this
whole visit was about,

37:51.102 --> 37:52.738
coming together as a family.

37:52.771 --> 37:54.105
So let's just go
ahead and lay all

37:54.139 --> 37:55.774
our secrets out on
the table right now.

37:55.807 --> 37:57.643
I'll start if need be.

37:57.676 --> 38:00.612
When I was 14, I masturbated
to Mrs. Peel from the Avengers.

38:00.646 --> 38:02.581
(laughing)

38:02.614 --> 38:03.615
That's mine.

38:04.450 --> 38:06.284
All right, who's next?

38:09.120 --> 38:09.921
- It's late.

38:09.955 --> 38:12.123
Goodnight, everybody.

38:12.157 --> 38:15.093
- Yeah, that's a good idea.

38:15.126 --> 38:17.463
- Yeah, I'm pretty beat, too.

38:28.707 --> 38:31.643
(eerie whispering)

38:46.324 --> 38:48.994
(dramatic music)

38:57.335 --> 38:59.871
(chains rattling)

38:59.905 --> 39:04.042
(dramatic music)
(eerie whispering)

39:09.347 --> 39:12.183
(door creaking)

39:14.920 --> 39:19.190
(dramatic music)
(eerie whispering)

39:24.362 --> 39:27.365
(chains rattling)

39:35.774 --> 39:38.376
(door creaking)

39:42.614 --> 39:46.885
(dramatic music)
(electricity buzzing)

39:48.119 --> 39:50.388
(dramatic music)

39:50.422 --> 39:51.457
- Kristin.

39:52.390 --> 39:53.625
Wake up, Kristin.

39:55.260 --> 39:56.061
Let go.

39:56.094 --> 39:57.429
- Sis, wake up.

39:57.463 --> 39:58.263
- [Katie] Kristin, hey.

39:58.296 --> 39:59.230
- Hey, sis, wake up.

39:59.264 --> 40:00.198
- Hey, Kristin.

40:00.231 --> 40:01.032
- Wake up.

40:01.066 --> 40:02.868
Hey, let go, let go.

40:02.901 --> 40:03.935
- Oh God, no.

40:05.737 --> 40:08.073
- [Bobby] Kristin, Kristin.

40:10.576 --> 40:11.376
- She's not in her--

40:11.409 --> 40:12.478
- [Dom] No!

40:13.579 --> 40:15.280
- Wake up, wake up.

40:15.313 --> 40:16.882
Wake up, let go.

40:16.915 --> 40:18.049
Let go.

40:18.083 --> 40:20.318
- [Katie] It's okay, Kristin.

40:21.820 --> 40:22.621
- What?

40:25.657 --> 40:27.325
Am I doing down here?

40:31.262 --> 40:32.898
- You sleepwalked.

40:32.931 --> 40:33.765
Again.

40:37.102 --> 40:38.770
- Don't you remember?

40:44.009 --> 40:46.578
- [Mom] Katie, now is
not the time for that.

40:46.612 --> 40:48.614
- It's the perfect time.

40:52.317 --> 40:53.585
Not getting anything anyway.

40:53.619 --> 40:55.153
- Can we talk
about the meds now?

40:55.186 --> 40:58.490
'Cause I'm guessing they have
something to do with this.

40:58.524 --> 40:59.457
Where are you going?

40:59.491 --> 41:00.458
- Bed.

41:00.492 --> 41:01.426
- Bed? Okay.

41:01.459 --> 41:02.628
Come on, I'll go with ya.

41:02.661 --> 41:04.830
- They're simply to
help with her anxiety.

41:04.863 --> 41:06.297
- Anxiety?

41:06.331 --> 41:07.599
What kind?

41:07.633 --> 41:08.800
- Just stress.

41:10.035 --> 41:11.503
- Well, how long has she
been on the medication?

41:11.537 --> 41:13.505
- Since she was six.

41:13.539 --> 41:15.306
- That's a little premature
to be going on meds, isn't it?

41:15.340 --> 41:18.109
- If you saw what would happen
to her, you'd understand.

41:18.143 --> 41:20.011
- Six is when Dad left.

41:21.312 --> 41:22.147
- Mom?

41:29.521 --> 41:34.025
- When Kristin was six their
father took her fishing.

41:34.059 --> 41:35.193
He got drunk.

41:37.328 --> 41:39.998
Kristin fell in and drowned.

41:40.031 --> 41:41.967
A man there pulled her out,

41:42.000 --> 41:43.501
ambulances arrived.

41:44.836 --> 41:48.339
She was pronounced dead
for about five minutes.

41:48.373 --> 41:51.176
After that, things
weren't the same.

41:51.209 --> 41:54.045
She wasn't the same.

41:56.514 --> 41:57.816
She'd get so frightened.

41:57.849 --> 42:00.485
She'd have relentless
panic attacks.

42:00.518 --> 42:02.988
I would hold her for
hours until she finally

42:03.021 --> 42:04.556
would begin to calm.

42:08.894 --> 42:10.395
No one is comfortable
putting a child

42:10.428 --> 42:12.698
at her age on meds.

42:12.731 --> 42:14.700
But after seeing how
bad it would get,

42:14.733 --> 42:17.736
there didn't seem
to be any options.

42:19.605 --> 42:21.773
- And they worked until now.

42:22.741 --> 42:25.677
I remember what I saw back then.

42:25.711 --> 42:29.180
People who aren't really there.

42:29.214 --> 42:32.718
They'd rush up to me, shouting
things I didn't understand.

42:32.751 --> 42:36.021
They'd follow me,
they wouldn't stop.

42:36.054 --> 42:37.756
Always another and another.

42:37.789 --> 42:42.060
No matter how much I'd
scream, they wouldn't stop.

42:43.561 --> 42:46.197
The pills made them go away.

42:46.231 --> 42:48.734
- [Katie] Until you moved here.

42:51.136 --> 42:52.437
- [Kristin] Yeah.

42:59.745 --> 43:02.113
- I am so sorry

43:02.580 --> 43:05.050
if I ever made you
feel pressured.

43:05.083 --> 43:06.251
- That's okay.

43:08.754 --> 43:10.455
How do I tell you I died once

43:10.488 --> 43:12.590
and I think I'm crazy?

43:13.591 --> 43:14.760
- No, not crazy.

43:16.662 --> 43:18.229
You're jacked in.

43:18.263 --> 43:19.564
It's this house.

43:19.597 --> 43:22.400
The spirit's presence
is powerful here.

43:22.433 --> 43:24.235
- Wait, spirits?

43:24.269 --> 43:25.503
As in ghosts?

43:28.173 --> 43:29.741
- You think that
she just happened to

43:29.775 --> 43:32.410
stumble upon that bag?

43:32.443 --> 43:33.812
The journal?

43:33.845 --> 43:35.613
Or was she led to it?

43:36.782 --> 43:38.249
What you were seeing
before you went on

43:38.283 --> 43:41.119
those pharmaceuticals
were spirits.

43:41.152 --> 43:42.654
You've been to their side

43:42.688 --> 43:46.157
and ever since they've
recognized you as a conduit.

43:46.191 --> 43:48.326
You just haven't been
recognizing them back

43:48.359 --> 43:49.928
because of those pills.

43:49.961 --> 43:51.262
- But why?

43:51.296 --> 43:55.166
- That's what we're
about to find out.

43:55.200 --> 43:59.170
I'm going to need that
table centered in this room.

43:59.204 --> 44:00.271
- What?

44:00.305 --> 44:01.773
- Hey, future
sister-in-law, bro.

44:01.807 --> 44:03.641
Come on, play along.

44:12.050 --> 44:16.487
- We begin by joining
hands and closing our eyes.

44:18.656 --> 44:19.657
Breathe.

44:22.894 --> 44:26.331
(inhaling and exhaling)

44:27.999 --> 44:31.837
Calm, comfortable, and in
touch with your senses.

44:31.870 --> 44:33.839
Just relax and breathe.

44:34.873 --> 44:38.343
(inhaling and exhaling)

44:39.677 --> 44:43.514
By joining hands we
form a circle of energy.

44:44.716 --> 44:46.718
We have to interpret
and hope we can

44:46.752 --> 44:48.353
understand right.

44:51.256 --> 44:53.859
You're being reached out to.

44:56.227 --> 45:00.431
The energy cycling through
this house is strong.

45:01.266 --> 45:03.601
I feel seven tortured souls.

45:05.570 --> 45:07.705
All bound to this house.

45:07.739 --> 45:10.175
Six in unity and one not.

45:10.208 --> 45:13.544
He's their keeper
in the afterlife.

45:13.578 --> 45:17.783
Yes, he is older, keeping
the six young ones at bay.

45:19.617 --> 45:21.887
They want to get past him.

45:22.720 --> 45:25.190
He won't let them out.

45:25.223 --> 45:27.025
Repeat after me.

45:27.058 --> 45:29.260
Spirit dweller in this house,

45:29.294 --> 45:32.197
we ask that you commune
with our circle.

45:32.230 --> 45:35.033
- [All] Spirit
dweller in this house,

45:35.066 --> 45:38.436
we ask that you commune
with our circle.

45:38.469 --> 45:41.272
Spirit dweller in this house,

45:41.306 --> 45:44.876
we ask that you commune
with our circle.

45:44.910 --> 45:47.712
Spirit dweller in this house,

45:47.745 --> 45:50.048
we ask that you commune
with our circle.

45:50.081 --> 45:53.751
- Spirit, if you can
hear us, we welcome you.

45:54.786 --> 45:56.754
Please join us.

45:56.788 --> 45:59.757
(dramatic music)

46:00.758 --> 46:03.728
(speaking in foreign language)

46:03.761 --> 46:06.564
Little grumpets, they are.

46:06.597 --> 46:07.933
Why are you here?

46:09.434 --> 46:11.269
Leave my house.

46:11.302 --> 46:12.470
Get out.

46:12.503 --> 46:13.805
Keep away.

46:13.839 --> 46:16.741
Keep away from
them, they're mine.

46:16.774 --> 46:18.776
Together we are bound
for all of time.

46:18.810 --> 46:20.411
Keep away from them.

46:20.445 --> 46:21.779
(bones cracking)

46:21.813 --> 46:24.782
(dramatic music)

46:52.810 --> 46:53.778
- Get away!

46:53.811 --> 46:54.612
Get away from me!

46:54.645 --> 46:56.347
Get away from me!

46:56.381 --> 46:57.282
- What? What is it?

46:57.315 --> 46:58.449
- [Kristin] Get away from me!

46:58.483 --> 46:59.284
- Kristin!

46:59.317 --> 47:00.351
- Get away from me!

47:00.385 --> 47:01.186
- [Dom] What? What is it?

47:01.219 --> 47:02.353
- Get away from me!

47:02.387 --> 47:03.821
Get away!

47:03.855 --> 47:05.790
- [Dom] Keep away!
(chair banging)

47:05.823 --> 47:08.826
- There is the man,
you go in peace.

47:12.497 --> 47:13.331
Holy shit!

47:14.199 --> 47:16.001
Did that just happen?

47:16.034 --> 47:17.335
Huh?

47:17.368 --> 47:18.803
I didn't ask for him
to come into my body.

47:18.836 --> 47:19.837
He did that.

47:19.871 --> 47:21.372
And he stepped out.

47:21.406 --> 47:22.807
This is unbelievable.

47:22.840 --> 47:25.143
What did you see?

47:25.176 --> 47:26.644
- Nothing.

47:26.677 --> 47:27.812
- Then why did you
swing the chair?

47:27.845 --> 47:30.882
- Because you thought
you saw something.

47:30.916 --> 47:33.684
- I don't know what I saw.

47:33.718 --> 47:35.820
It felt like it was
pressing in at me.

47:35.853 --> 47:37.822
Whatever it was it
wanted to hurt me.

47:37.855 --> 47:38.823
- Okay, you know what?

47:38.856 --> 47:40.158
I'm sorry.

47:40.191 --> 47:41.859
No disrespect, but
this isn't helping.

47:41.893 --> 47:43.895
Maybe we could just wrap
this up in the morning.

47:43.929 --> 47:45.363
- Ghosts are spirits
that are stuck here

47:45.396 --> 47:47.498
in a state of unrest.

47:47.532 --> 47:49.534
Sometimes they need
assistance from the living.

47:49.567 --> 47:51.836
This is not the place
for them to be judged.

47:51.869 --> 47:54.705
Our place is to
assist their crossing

47:54.739 --> 47:57.042
so they can be judged
on the other side.

47:57.075 --> 48:00.078
- Okay, okay, fun is
fun, but this is serious.

48:00.111 --> 48:01.346
Nothing that was
said wasn't anything

48:01.379 --> 48:02.880
that we didn't read
in the journal.

48:02.914 --> 48:07.352
- That she found hidden
behind a wall in this house.

48:07.385 --> 48:09.587
Something here has
broken through.

48:09.620 --> 48:12.057
And it's too strong to ignore.

48:13.791 --> 48:16.194
Why don't you two just move?

48:16.227 --> 48:17.895
And she can keep
popping her pills.

48:17.929 --> 48:18.729
- [Mom] Katie!

48:18.763 --> 48:19.864
- You don't have
to live with this.

48:19.897 --> 48:20.765
- Then live with it!

48:20.798 --> 48:21.866
Stop running from it.

48:21.899 --> 48:23.034
- All right, all
right, hey, come on.

48:23.068 --> 48:24.202
Let's just cool it.

48:24.235 --> 48:26.071
- Yeah, because there's,

48:26.104 --> 48:28.039
there's something in here.

48:28.073 --> 48:29.107
- [Kristin] Well, what is it?

48:29.140 --> 48:30.741
- [Cindy] I can't tell.

48:30.775 --> 48:31.776
- Look, see?

48:41.987 --> 48:44.289
- The people in the sketches.

48:45.490 --> 48:47.392
Oh my God, these are
the medical files,

48:47.425 --> 48:51.396
detailing every torture
he did to each one of 'em.

48:51.429 --> 48:52.163
No names.

48:53.298 --> 48:55.133
Just their numbers.

48:55.166 --> 48:59.337
- That something
led us to, again.

49:00.972 --> 49:02.940
- I'm sorry, but
if there really is

49:02.974 --> 49:05.110
an evil presence in this house,

49:05.143 --> 49:07.245
then we're going to
find out the right way.

49:07.278 --> 49:08.413
(folder slapping)

49:08.446 --> 49:09.780
- [Newsman] In local news today,

49:09.814 --> 49:11.249
the community mourns
the tragic loss...

49:11.282 --> 49:12.250
- Look at this.

49:12.283 --> 49:13.584
Hey, come look at this.

49:13.618 --> 49:14.952
- What's up?

49:14.986 --> 49:16.587
- [Newsman] His body was
found electrocuted to death.

49:16.621 --> 49:18.289
- [Dom] It's our electrician.

49:18.689 --> 49:19.490
- [Kevin] What, is he dead?

49:19.524 --> 49:20.425
- Yeah.

49:20.458 --> 49:23.194
(engine rumbling)

49:24.962 --> 49:26.764
- Authorities have yet
to determine whether

49:26.797 --> 49:30.768
this tragedy be a freak
accident or foul play.

49:30.801 --> 49:32.837
(knocking)

49:37.142 --> 49:38.009
- Hello, Father Michaels.

49:38.043 --> 49:39.144
Thank you for coming so quickly.

49:39.177 --> 49:41.112
- Good morning, Dominick.

49:41.146 --> 49:43.614
We missed you last Sunday.

49:43.648 --> 49:45.816
- Yeah, we were
crazy overwhelmed

49:45.850 --> 49:48.019
with the move, getting
ready for the family.

49:48.053 --> 49:48.853
- I see.

49:50.055 --> 49:51.356
- Please come in.

49:53.724 --> 49:55.326
Everyone, this is
Father Michaels.

49:55.360 --> 49:56.627
Father Michaels, everyone.

49:56.661 --> 49:57.462
- [Mom] Hello, Father.

49:57.495 --> 49:58.463
- Good morning.

49:58.496 --> 49:59.297
- [Cindy] Hello.

49:59.330 --> 50:00.065
- Morning.

50:02.067 --> 50:03.801
- This is the journal
that I mentioned

50:03.834 --> 50:05.870
as well as the other items.

50:18.183 --> 50:21.352
(soft dramatic music)

50:23.754 --> 50:26.857
- Is it true you discovered
this while sleepwalking?

50:26.891 --> 50:27.925
- Yes.

50:33.731 --> 50:36.267
- [Dom] So what do you think?

50:39.937 --> 50:42.207
- I'd like to recite
a few passages.

50:42.240 --> 50:43.874
If there's any
undesirable spirits,

50:43.908 --> 50:46.677
it will help to expel them.

50:46.711 --> 50:47.512
Do you mind?

50:47.545 --> 50:48.379
- Sure.

50:53.784 --> 50:55.853
- Lord have mercy.

50:55.886 --> 50:57.188
- [All] Lord have mercy.

50:57.222 --> 50:58.389
- Christ have mercy.

50:58.423 --> 50:59.757
- [All] Christ have mercy.

50:59.790 --> 51:02.026
- Holy Mary mother of
Jesus, pray for us.

51:02.059 --> 51:03.228
- [All] Amen.

51:09.734 --> 51:12.870
- Save your servants
who trust in you, Lord.

51:12.903 --> 51:15.740
Let them find a new
fortified tower.

51:15.773 --> 51:18.543
Let the enemy have
no power here.

51:18.576 --> 51:20.878
We drive you from
us unclean spirits,

51:20.911 --> 51:23.214
satanic powers,
all wicked legions,

51:23.248 --> 51:25.750
in the name of and
the power of our Lord.

51:25.783 --> 51:27.585
Give place to Christ.

51:27.618 --> 51:30.054
Stoop beneath the
all-powerful hand of God.

51:30.087 --> 51:32.590
Tremble and flee
when we invoke the...

51:32.623 --> 51:35.293
(dramatic music)

51:40.131 --> 51:44.335
It, it seems that there's
something truly present here.

51:48.139 --> 51:51.075
Whatever it is, it's
coming from upstairs.

51:51.108 --> 51:54.011
- Where she found
the doctor's bag.

51:58.649 --> 52:00.918
- We beseech thee
through Jesus Christ

52:00.951 --> 52:04.155
to deliver us from the
tyranny of evil spirits.

52:04.189 --> 52:06.291
(dramatic music)

52:06.324 --> 52:10.828
From the temptations and
their furious wickedness.

52:10.861 --> 52:12.263
Through Jesus Christ,

52:12.297 --> 52:14.165
grant us that powerful...

52:14.199 --> 52:16.501
(dramatic music)

52:16.534 --> 52:18.002
from the snares of evil.

52:18.035 --> 52:20.004
(dramatic music)

52:20.037 --> 52:21.639
(gasping)

52:21.672 --> 52:22.973
- [Mom] Father!

52:26.177 --> 52:28.479
(grunting)

52:31.148 --> 52:32.016
- [Mom] Kristin!

52:32.049 --> 52:36.020
(grunting)
(dramatic music)

52:45.363 --> 52:47.832
(screaming)

52:55.673 --> 52:57.208
- [Mom] Kristin!

52:57.242 --> 52:58.476
No!

52:58.509 --> 53:00.745
(grunting)

53:03.681 --> 53:05.916
(growling)

53:09.254 --> 53:11.589
(vomiting)

53:13.858 --> 53:16.160
(grunting)

53:16.193 --> 53:18.529
(vomiting)

53:19.764 --> 53:23.000
(dramatic music)

53:23.033 --> 53:25.202
- Look at what you're
doing to me, Father.

53:25.236 --> 53:27.037
Are you fucking blind?

53:28.205 --> 53:30.908
(dramatic music)

53:34.245 --> 53:35.045
Uh!

53:35.880 --> 53:38.583
(dramatic music)

53:48.459 --> 53:49.360
- [Mom] Oh my God.

53:49.394 --> 53:51.462
Father, are you all right?

53:54.632 --> 53:55.866
Go, go take care of him.

53:55.900 --> 53:56.701
I've got her.

53:56.734 --> 53:57.935
Go! Go!

53:57.968 --> 54:00.305
- Father Michaels, wait, wait.

54:09.447 --> 54:12.216
- You need to leave this
place now, Dominick.

54:12.249 --> 54:13.551
There's an evil in that house

54:13.584 --> 54:15.386
unlike any ever imagined.

54:15.420 --> 54:18.155
(car starting)

54:22.327 --> 54:25.596
(soft dramatic music)

54:49.654 --> 54:51.255
- Get out! Get out!

54:51.288 --> 54:52.923
Get the fuck out of here!

54:52.957 --> 54:53.924
I want you out!

54:53.958 --> 54:54.925
Get out!

54:54.959 --> 54:55.993
Please!

54:56.026 --> 54:57.495
Please leave me alone!

54:57.528 --> 54:59.930
You get out! Get out!

54:59.964 --> 55:02.533
(dramatic music)

55:14.345 --> 55:17.515
(whimpering)

55:17.548 --> 55:18.849
- Oh my God.

55:18.883 --> 55:20.184
We need to get her
in the house now!

55:20.217 --> 55:21.318
Go!

55:23.488 --> 55:27.658
(whimpering)
(dramatic music)

55:36.901 --> 55:38.335
- How's she doin'?

55:40.037 --> 55:42.139
- Her pulse is strong.

55:42.172 --> 55:43.674
It's back to normal.

55:43.708 --> 55:45.042
- Look at that.

55:45.075 --> 55:47.077
Look at Kristin's hands.

55:48.579 --> 55:50.214
- [Dom] Oh my God.

55:58.255 --> 56:01.358
(nervous laughing)

56:09.233 --> 56:11.669
- These are the heavy hitters.

56:11.702 --> 56:14.605
Nothing's gonna
bother you tonight.

56:19.544 --> 56:21.011
I'll take first shift.

56:21.045 --> 56:24.281
You guys have been
through a lot today.

56:27.785 --> 56:30.220
- I'm not crazy to
see and hear them.

56:30.254 --> 56:31.255
- [Dom] Oh, no, no.

56:31.288 --> 56:32.056
- No, honey.

56:32.089 --> 56:33.758
- Kristin, no.

56:33.791 --> 56:35.359
- It's not in my head.

56:35.392 --> 56:36.427
- No.

56:39.063 --> 56:40.097
We're all together.

56:40.130 --> 56:41.699
The rest of the
family is downstairs,

56:41.732 --> 56:45.570
and Dom and I will be
with you all night, okay?

56:49.073 --> 56:50.441
Tomorrow we are gonna
figure this thing

56:50.475 --> 56:53.377
out once and for all, all right?

56:53.410 --> 56:54.411
- All right.

56:55.580 --> 56:58.415
(soft piano music)

57:25.510 --> 57:28.278
(dramatic music)

57:44.294 --> 57:46.531
(grunting)

57:53.538 --> 57:55.806
(whimpering)

58:09.520 --> 58:10.521
- Oh my God.

58:16.493 --> 58:17.394
Oh, oh God.

58:19.496 --> 58:20.497
Kristin.

58:20.531 --> 58:22.132
Kristin!

58:22.166 --> 58:23.000
Kristin!

58:26.370 --> 58:27.872
Oh, she's ice cold.

58:27.905 --> 58:29.206
Kristin, sweetheart,
can you hear me?

58:29.239 --> 58:31.141
- Kristin, Kristin, come on.

58:31.175 --> 58:32.142
- Baby, wake up!

58:32.176 --> 58:33.043
- Come on, baby, wake up.

58:33.077 --> 58:34.044
- [Mom] Kristin, wake up!

58:34.078 --> 58:34.712
- What is going on?

58:34.745 --> 58:37.347
- Kristin, wake up!

58:37.381 --> 58:39.383
I need smelling salts
from your med kit.

58:39.416 --> 58:41.385
- I'll be right back.

58:43.353 --> 58:44.521
- [Mom] Kristin!

58:46.557 --> 58:47.758
- [Kevin] Mom.

58:53.030 --> 58:55.232
(gasping)

58:56.400 --> 58:59.169
- [Kristin] Oh my God!

58:59.203 --> 59:00.738
- It stopped bleeding.

59:00.771 --> 59:04.041
It's okay, it's, it's
just a surface wound.

59:04.074 --> 59:07.077
- They can get to
you in your sleep.

59:11.548 --> 59:13.718
- This can't be happening.

59:15.920 --> 59:19.056
- Oh, hey, hey, it's
okay, it's okay.

59:31.435 --> 59:34.438
- Feel like you
gotta fix something?

59:41.411 --> 59:42.146
- Yeah.

59:43.648 --> 59:47.251
Tryin' to get a grasp
on things, I guess.

59:48.418 --> 59:50.587
Everything that's
been happening.

59:50.621 --> 59:52.289
If you would've told
me about this before,

59:52.322 --> 59:54.058
I wouldn't have believed you.

59:54.091 --> 59:55.893
With her wrist in the bedroom,

59:55.926 --> 59:57.561
everything that's happened
with Father Michaels here--

59:57.594 --> 59:58.428
- I know.

59:58.462 --> 01:00:00.931
It was kind of like stigmata.

01:00:01.966 --> 01:00:03.467
- Marks of Jesus on her body.

01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:05.569
- And then some.

01:00:05.602 --> 01:00:06.470
But it's bogus.

01:00:06.503 --> 01:00:08.238
It's a sham.

01:00:08.272 --> 01:00:09.907
It's something in this house

01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:11.241
wants something from her

01:00:11.275 --> 01:00:14.511
and it's not gonna
stop until it gets it.

01:00:20.785 --> 01:00:23.453
- [Mom] Yes, I see, okay.

01:00:23.487 --> 01:00:26.123
- Well, wall's all fixed up.

01:00:26.156 --> 01:00:28.325
- Well, thank you for calling.

01:00:28.358 --> 01:00:29.927
Yes, I will.

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:30.795
Goodbye.

01:00:33.964 --> 01:00:35.599
I don't know how
to tell you this.

01:00:35.632 --> 01:00:38.135
That was somebody from
Father Michaels' parish.

01:00:38.168 --> 01:00:39.870
He's, he's dead, Dom.

01:00:41.205 --> 01:00:42.006
- How?

01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:44.441
- Heart attack.

01:00:44.474 --> 01:00:46.811
His car went off the road.

01:00:46.844 --> 01:00:48.813
- I've known him my whole life.

01:00:48.846 --> 01:00:50.147
My family, too.

01:00:52.683 --> 01:00:54.952
- Don't you guys get it?

01:00:54.985 --> 01:00:56.353
People can't come or
go into this place

01:00:56.386 --> 01:00:58.856
without being harmed or killed.

01:00:58.889 --> 01:01:01.525
You get hurt every
time you try to leave.

01:01:01.558 --> 01:01:04.528
The answer's got to
be in this journal.

01:01:04.561 --> 01:01:05.696
It has to be.

01:01:15.539 --> 01:01:16.741
February 27th.

01:01:18.242 --> 01:01:20.544
I've been secretly observing
number one and four's behavior.

01:01:20.577 --> 01:01:22.813
They've begun creating
a means of communication

01:01:22.847 --> 01:01:24.514
through taps and
scratches of the walls...

01:01:24.548 --> 01:01:28.719
- [Jonah] And subtle
rattles of their chains.

01:01:28.753 --> 01:01:31.555
(screaming)

01:01:31.588 --> 01:01:33.557
(tapping)

01:01:39.029 --> 01:01:40.664
The others have
also picked up on

01:01:40.697 --> 01:01:44.068
and use number one and four's
method for communicating.

01:01:44.101 --> 01:01:46.703
They will now tap and
scratch at the walls.

01:01:46.737 --> 01:01:48.672
They fully developed a
language of their own

01:01:48.705 --> 01:01:51.175
and communicate with each
other from room to room

01:01:51.208 --> 01:01:53.744
while thinking I'm asleep.

01:01:53.778 --> 01:01:55.245
The noises.

01:01:55.279 --> 01:01:56.380
- [Man] No!

01:01:56.413 --> 01:01:57.681
- [Jonah] Make the
noises all night long...

01:01:57.714 --> 01:02:00.050
- [Jonah] Until the point
that it's maddening.

01:02:00.084 --> 01:02:01.018
(wrench thudding)

01:02:01.051 --> 01:02:02.586
I tried to set an example.

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:05.856
I beat one, number six,

01:02:05.890 --> 01:02:08.092
to the point of death.

01:02:08.125 --> 01:02:10.427
All the while I made
sure the others would

01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:11.762
hear his cries.

01:02:13.798 --> 01:02:16.400
(whimpering)

01:02:29.413 --> 01:02:30.881
- No.

01:02:30.915 --> 01:02:35.119
(crying)
(dramatic music)

01:02:52.636 --> 01:02:56.941
- [Jonah] My example should
reset their attitudes.

01:02:56.974 --> 01:02:59.276
My studies can begin again.

01:03:02.646 --> 01:03:05.615
(dramatic music)

01:03:54.164 --> 01:03:57.968
I fear I have made a grave
mistake in my experiments.

01:03:58.002 --> 01:04:00.670
I've pushed this too far.

01:04:00.704 --> 01:04:04.674
All I get now is irreversible
hatred, pure evil.

01:04:08.913 --> 01:04:10.847
I'm afraid this
experiment is no longer

01:04:10.881 --> 01:04:12.582
pleasurable for me.

01:04:19.856 --> 01:04:22.726
(grinder scraping)

01:04:38.742 --> 01:04:40.945
(hissing)

01:04:43.547 --> 01:04:45.882
(coughing)

01:04:46.917 --> 01:04:49.053
(crying)

01:04:52.056 --> 01:04:54.391
(coughing)

01:04:55.725 --> 01:04:58.262
(blade slicing)

01:05:00.931 --> 01:05:02.766
I write with deep
sorrow that I will

01:05:02.799 --> 01:05:04.734
destroy this flock,

01:05:04.768 --> 01:05:06.736
re-evaluate my
methods for studying

01:05:06.770 --> 01:05:08.405
humans in captivity,

01:05:09.273 --> 01:05:10.574
and start anew.

01:05:11.976 --> 01:05:14.711
(gasping)

01:05:14.744 --> 01:05:16.546
(coughing)

01:05:16.580 --> 01:05:19.149
(blade slicing)

01:05:22.452 --> 01:05:25.122
(dramatic music)

01:05:29.326 --> 01:05:31.628
(coughing)

01:05:37.001 --> 01:05:39.936
(blade slicing)

01:05:42.772 --> 01:05:44.908
(coughing)

01:05:44.941 --> 01:05:48.945
(screaming)
(blade slicing)

01:05:50.447 --> 01:05:53.117
(dramatic music)

01:05:54.951 --> 01:05:57.821
(coughing)

01:05:57.854 --> 01:06:00.624
(blade slicing)

01:06:06.663 --> 01:06:07.431
- That's it.

01:06:07.464 --> 01:06:08.865
There's no more.

01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:13.303
- He killed all six
of them in this house.

01:06:13.337 --> 01:06:14.304
- Seems so.

01:06:31.988 --> 01:06:33.357
We need to do something.

01:06:33.390 --> 01:06:34.991
Something that's
going to end this.

01:06:35.025 --> 01:06:36.826
- It won't be easy.

01:06:36.860 --> 01:06:39.363
They speak through Kristin.

01:06:39.396 --> 01:06:41.331
We're going to need her, too.

01:06:41.365 --> 01:06:42.866
- I'll talk to her.

01:06:45.001 --> 01:06:46.536
You should've told
me about this thing

01:06:46.570 --> 01:06:48.472
with Kristin sooner.

01:06:48.505 --> 01:06:51.375
- I should've told
everyone sooner.

01:06:52.509 --> 01:06:56.012
I was hoping you'd
give me another chance.

01:06:58.014 --> 01:07:01.185
(soft dramatic music)

01:07:09.359 --> 01:07:12.229
(eerie whispering)

01:07:18.568 --> 01:07:20.904
- This stays covered, okay?

01:07:23.873 --> 01:07:25.109
Hands.

01:07:28.545 --> 01:07:32.716
The words are (speaking
in foreign language).

01:07:36.052 --> 01:07:38.188
Keep it covered
until you see him.

01:07:38.222 --> 01:07:38.955
- Got it.

01:07:40.890 --> 01:07:42.926
- [Katie] Spirit
dwellers in this house...

01:07:42.959 --> 01:07:45.262
- [All] We invite you to
commune with our circle.

01:07:45.295 --> 01:07:47.431
Spirit dwellers in this house,

01:07:47.464 --> 01:07:50.100
we invite you to
commune with our circle.

01:07:50.134 --> 01:07:52.068
Spirit dwellers in this house,

01:07:52.102 --> 01:07:55.071
we invite you to
commune with our circle.

01:07:55.105 --> 01:07:56.140
Spirit dwell...

01:07:58.608 --> 01:08:01.545
If you can hear us, we
ask that you join us.

01:08:01.578 --> 01:08:04.248
(dramatic music)

01:08:13.290 --> 01:08:15.492
- Meddling little nasties.

01:08:17.127 --> 01:08:19.496
You haven't heeded my warning.

01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:24.067
Grumpets, they're not the same.

01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:26.670
Changed, wild and rational-less.

01:08:29.139 --> 01:08:32.276
I told you leave this place.

01:08:32.309 --> 01:08:34.778
Leave here, they're mine.

01:08:34.810 --> 01:08:35.578
- How?

01:08:35.612 --> 01:08:36.412
We can't leave.

01:08:36.446 --> 01:08:37.747
You won't let her.

01:08:37.781 --> 01:08:39.082
- No.

01:08:39.115 --> 01:08:39.849
Not me.

01:08:40.783 --> 01:08:41.818
Them.

01:08:41.850 --> 01:08:43.153
- Your victims?

01:08:45.154 --> 01:08:48.124
(dramatic music)

01:08:49.993 --> 01:08:51.027
Now!

01:08:51.861 --> 01:08:54.163
(growling)

01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:58.935
(grunting)

01:08:58.968 --> 01:09:00.304
- No!

01:09:00.337 --> 01:09:01.136
No!

01:09:07.644 --> 01:09:08.377
Mom.

01:09:11.848 --> 01:09:14.451
(whimpering)

01:09:14.484 --> 01:09:15.685
- Nasties, two.

01:09:15.719 --> 01:09:16.486
- Mom!

01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:18.020
- No, no Mom.

01:09:18.054 --> 01:09:19.622
Quick, before a full confession.

01:09:19.656 --> 01:09:22.526
- You won't leave,
you'll join them.

01:09:22.559 --> 01:09:23.827
Sinners first.

01:09:26.062 --> 01:09:27.464
- [All] No!

01:09:27.497 --> 01:09:29.131
- Mom!

01:09:29.165 --> 01:09:29.899
Mom!

01:09:32.368 --> 01:09:34.638
- Stay back, stay back!

01:09:34.671 --> 01:09:35.971
Mom, Mom!

01:09:36.005 --> 01:09:37.573
- [Dom] God, is she?

01:09:46.082 --> 01:09:47.050
- It's me now.

01:09:53.357 --> 01:09:55.725
(screaming)

01:09:57.694 --> 01:09:59.696
- No, no, no, no, Cindy!

01:10:01.064 --> 01:10:02.232
- [Kristin] No!

01:10:02.266 --> 01:10:03.032
- [Bobby] Uh!

01:10:03.066 --> 01:10:04.668
- Stop!

01:10:04.701 --> 01:10:05.535
No!

01:10:06.736 --> 01:10:07.537
No! Stop!

01:10:12.742 --> 01:10:13.677
Don't! No!

01:10:13.710 --> 01:10:14.411
No, no, no, no!

01:10:14.444 --> 01:10:15.345
Leave him!

01:10:15.379 --> 01:10:16.212
- No!

01:10:20.917 --> 01:10:23.086
(screaming)

01:10:28.224 --> 01:10:29.593
No!

01:10:29.626 --> 01:10:33.096
- Get him to the orb!
Get him to the orb now!

01:10:33.129 --> 01:10:36.065
(dramatic music)

01:10:37.066 --> 01:10:39.235
(screaming)

01:10:40.136 --> 01:10:44.308
(speaking in foreign language)

01:10:45.309 --> 01:10:48.077
(dramatic music)

01:11:00.290 --> 01:11:01.925
Back.

01:11:01.958 --> 01:11:03.226
Get back.

01:11:03.259 --> 01:11:05.929
(dramatic music)

01:11:08.465 --> 01:11:11.167
(orb shattering)

01:11:14.438 --> 01:11:15.739
Uh-oh.

01:11:15.772 --> 01:11:16.573
- What?

01:11:16.606 --> 01:11:18.408
What's uh-oh?

01:11:18.442 --> 01:11:21.978
(dramatic music)

01:11:22.011 --> 01:11:22.812
Next.

01:11:26.115 --> 01:11:27.584
- Quick, pull it out!

01:11:27.617 --> 01:11:30.286
(dramatic music)

01:11:34.157 --> 01:11:35.792
- What's going on?

01:11:38.194 --> 01:11:38.995
- Dom?

01:11:40.364 --> 01:11:41.164
- Yeah.

01:11:41.998 --> 01:11:44.968
(soft piano music)

01:11:52.876 --> 01:11:55.011
(crying)

01:12:09.325 --> 01:12:10.827
- They're all dead.

01:12:12.396 --> 01:12:13.196
Katie!

01:12:15.499 --> 01:12:16.199
Katie!

01:12:16.232 --> 01:12:17.300
- What do we do, Katie?

01:12:17.333 --> 01:12:18.635
- Okay, okay, wait.

01:12:18.668 --> 01:12:19.703
I'm thinking.

01:12:39.055 --> 01:12:42.158
Kevin, he was trying
to tell us something.

01:12:42.191 --> 01:12:44.327
I need to try to
channel an entity.

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:45.429
- [Both] Whose?

01:12:46.362 --> 01:12:48.898
- Hopefully one of theirs.

01:12:48.932 --> 01:12:50.333
When my hand stops moving,

01:12:50.366 --> 01:12:54.370
you guys are gonna need
to start asking questions.

01:12:57.373 --> 01:12:58.374
- Katie?

01:12:59.242 --> 01:13:00.043
Katie?

01:13:01.911 --> 01:13:03.246
Falkhar's gone.

01:13:05.549 --> 01:13:07.350
Why can't Kristin
leave the house?

01:13:07.383 --> 01:13:09.719
What's still keeping her here?

01:13:11.254 --> 01:13:12.288
Once good.

01:13:14.758 --> 01:13:15.559
Wronged.

01:13:18.595 --> 01:13:19.395
Tainted.

01:13:20.464 --> 01:13:21.431
Darkened.

01:13:21.465 --> 01:13:22.398
An afterlife.

01:13:24.267 --> 01:13:27.103
- Innocence taken now malignant.

01:13:28.572 --> 01:13:30.039
- Falkhar, he wasn't
threatening us.

01:13:30.073 --> 01:13:32.275
This, this is a warning.

01:13:32.308 --> 01:13:33.376
- They were tricking
us all along.

01:13:33.409 --> 01:13:34.711
They didn't want to be saved.

01:13:34.744 --> 01:13:37.213
They wanted to be
freed from Falkhar.

01:13:37.246 --> 01:13:39.382
- We just exorcized him, great.

01:13:39.415 --> 01:13:40.717
Now what?

01:13:40.750 --> 01:13:43.052
- You're the one
that they're after.

01:13:43.086 --> 01:13:45.388
This is your crossroad.

01:13:45.421 --> 01:13:47.123
You've gotta do it.

01:13:47.991 --> 01:13:49.726
- Okay, how?

01:13:49.759 --> 01:13:51.761
- You are going to
have to go in there,

01:13:51.795 --> 01:13:55.131
face them, and ask
them what they want.

01:13:55.164 --> 01:13:56.466
- No, no, this is crazy.

01:13:56.500 --> 01:13:57.467
This is what she's
been terrified of

01:13:57.501 --> 01:13:58.902
her entire life.

01:13:58.935 --> 01:14:00.303
It's too dangerous.

01:14:01.471 --> 01:14:02.271
- 49.

01:14:03.973 --> 01:14:04.774
36.

01:14:05.942 --> 01:14:06.676
49.

01:14:07.944 --> 01:14:08.678
36.

01:14:10.013 --> 01:14:12.248
- [Katie and Kristin] 49.

01:14:12.281 --> 01:14:13.016
36.

01:14:14.618 --> 01:14:16.486
- [Kristin] 49.

01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:17.320
36.

01:14:18.454 --> 01:14:21.157
(dramatic music)

01:14:24.327 --> 01:14:27.296
(eerie whispering)

01:14:32.869 --> 01:14:34.103
- [Katie] I think she's in.

01:14:34.137 --> 01:14:34.971
How's her rhythm?

01:14:35.004 --> 01:14:36.640
- It's good, steady.

01:14:39.208 --> 01:14:40.610
What were those numbers?

01:14:40.644 --> 01:14:41.678
49, 36?

01:14:41.711 --> 01:14:42.946
- Nothing.

01:14:42.979 --> 01:14:44.113
Something to distract
her from blocking me

01:14:44.147 --> 01:14:45.448
so I could get her in.

01:14:45.481 --> 01:14:47.316
- [Dom] What's that?

01:14:48.852 --> 01:14:50.453
- It's how long she has.

01:14:50.486 --> 01:14:52.321
- There's a time limit?

01:14:52.355 --> 01:14:53.790
- [Katie] Nine minutes.

01:14:53.823 --> 01:14:56.392
One way or the other, it's over.

01:15:00.564 --> 01:15:04.500
(eerie whispering)
(dramatic music)

01:15:15.511 --> 01:15:18.147
- Her heart is changing.

01:15:18.181 --> 01:15:19.515
It's really fast.

01:15:21.417 --> 01:15:22.518
- Ugh.

01:15:24.420 --> 01:15:25.722
(grunting)

01:15:25.755 --> 01:15:27.991
- [Dom] Her heart just stopped.

01:15:28.024 --> 01:15:29.693
I can't feel a thing!

01:15:31.394 --> 01:15:32.528
- Shit! Shit!

01:15:32.562 --> 01:15:33.563
Shit, shit, shit!

01:15:33.597 --> 01:15:34.497
Get her on the floor!

01:15:34.530 --> 01:15:36.365
Get her on the floor now!

01:15:36.399 --> 01:15:38.401
Move out of the way, go.

01:15:39.603 --> 01:15:40.403
Oh, oh.

01:15:42.038 --> 01:15:44.708
(dramatic music)

01:15:48.111 --> 01:15:50.546
Shit, shit, shit, God damn it.

01:15:56.085 --> 01:15:58.421
We've got six minutes.

01:15:58.454 --> 01:16:00.056
I'll need your help.

01:16:01.557 --> 01:16:04.027
I'm bringing her back.

01:16:04.060 --> 01:16:06.730
(dramatic music)

01:16:16.806 --> 01:16:19.643
(timer ticking)

01:16:21.577 --> 01:16:24.447
(dramatic music)

01:16:29.585 --> 01:16:32.421
(clock ticking)

01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:39.462
(dramatic music)

01:16:53.109 --> 01:16:55.845
(chains rattling)

01:17:15.131 --> 01:17:17.500
(eerie music)

01:17:36.820 --> 01:17:39.723
(dramatic music)

01:17:40.656 --> 01:17:43.526
(grunting)

01:17:43.559 --> 01:17:46.229
(chain rattling)

01:17:47.563 --> 01:17:49.999
Please, I'm here to help.

01:17:50.033 --> 01:17:50.834
Please.

01:17:52.736 --> 01:17:55.171
I know what happened here.

01:17:55.204 --> 01:17:57.206
Please, let me help you.

01:17:59.008 --> 01:18:01.544
(dramatic music)

01:18:12.055 --> 01:18:12.856
Thank you.

01:18:16.359 --> 01:18:19.028
(dramatic music)

01:18:23.032 --> 01:18:26.169
(door slamming)

01:18:26.202 --> 01:18:28.872
(dramatic music)

01:18:35.779 --> 01:18:36.579
Shit!

01:18:38.547 --> 01:18:41.250
(dramatic music)

01:18:42.218 --> 01:18:45.288
(panicked breathing)

01:18:51.727 --> 01:18:54.430
(dramatic music)

01:19:24.260 --> 01:19:27.096
(chains rattling)

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:33.102
Go upstairs!

01:19:33.136 --> 01:19:34.137
Go upstairs.

01:19:38.842 --> 01:19:41.610
(dramatic music)

01:19:44.313 --> 01:19:46.983
(banging)

01:19:47.016 --> 01:19:49.785
(dramatic music)

01:19:51.154 --> 01:19:53.957
(chains rattling)

01:19:55.024 --> 01:19:57.693
(dramatic music)

01:20:17.881 --> 01:20:19.849
(banging)

01:20:22.718 --> 01:20:25.388
(dramatic music)

01:20:32.561 --> 01:20:34.030
- I can't hear you.

01:20:35.865 --> 01:20:38.667
(dramatic music)

01:20:42.238 --> 01:20:44.807
(mirror cracking)

01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:48.044
(mirror shattering)

01:20:48.077 --> 01:20:50.846
(dramatic music)

01:20:54.517 --> 01:20:55.251
Kristin!

01:20:59.855 --> 01:21:00.589
- Uh.

01:21:05.261 --> 01:21:07.363
(crying)

01:21:10.866 --> 01:21:13.336
Let's get out of here.

01:21:13.369 --> 01:21:16.039
(dramatic music)

01:21:23.246 --> 01:21:26.682
(doorknob rattling)

01:21:26.715 --> 01:21:29.385
(dramatic music)

01:21:38.094 --> 01:21:39.228
You okay?

01:21:39.262 --> 01:21:41.931
(dramatic music)

01:21:51.774 --> 01:21:55.244
(acoustic guitar music)

01:22:09.792 --> 01:22:13.896
* Before this song is over

01:22:13.929 --> 01:22:17.766
* Oh, would you dance with me

01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:21.837
* I need someone to hold onto

01:22:26.109 --> 01:22:29.945
* I've never felt this lonely

01:22:29.979 --> 01:22:33.249
* Maybe it's the melody

01:22:33.282 --> 01:22:36.752
* The right thing to ask

01:22:36.785 --> 01:22:40.356
* Is will you dance with me

01:22:41.190 --> 01:22:44.927
* Will you dance with me

01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:48.497
* Will you dance with me

01:22:49.798 --> 01:22:53.969
* I need to hold
you so desperately

01:22:57.473 --> 01:23:01.110
* Will you dance with me

01:23:01.144 --> 01:23:04.647
* Will you dance with me

01:23:05.548 --> 01:23:08.951
* Roll around in heaven

01:23:08.984 --> 01:23:11.987
* On and on with me

01:23:13.689 --> 01:23:16.492
* Your hair, your
eyes, your breath

01:23:16.525 --> 01:23:20.029
* It felt so close to me

01:23:21.164 --> 01:23:23.032
* We spin and turn

01:23:23.066 --> 01:23:27.070
* Feels right when I'm with you

01:23:29.572 --> 01:23:32.875
(electric guitar solo)

01:23:51.694 --> 01:23:54.897
* I've chased the stars

01:23:54.930 --> 01:23:59.668
* It's in your
sparklin' eyes I see

01:23:59.702 --> 01:24:03.772
* You're standing
there in front of me

01:24:06.909 --> 01:24:10.546
* I never cross the floor

01:24:11.780 --> 01:24:14.550
* But in my mind

01:24:17.753 --> 01:24:21.056
* Will you dance with me

01:24:21.924 --> 01:24:25.861
* Will you dance with me

01:24:25.894 --> 01:24:29.098
* Will you dance with me

01:24:30.305 --> 01:24:36.649
