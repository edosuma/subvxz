WEBVTT

00:01.675 --> 00:05.184
So I get this specimen labeled
"synovial fluid, left hip."

00:05.208 --> 00:06.216
And I'm looking at it,

00:06.241 --> 00:07.913
and it's not very viscous.

00:07.938 --> 00:10.222
Obviously, I'm thinking maybe it's gout,

00:10.247 --> 00:12.063
but there aren't any crystals
under the microscope,

00:12.088 --> 00:14.959
just cells,
so I call the intern who drew it,

00:14.984 --> 00:17.182
and he tells me he's trying
to rule out cirrhosis,

00:17.207 --> 00:18.704
which doesn't make any sense,

00:18.729 --> 00:20.335
until I suddenly realize,

00:20.360 --> 00:24.330
those weren't monocytes I was seeing,
they were PMLs.

00:24.563 --> 00:26.470
The guy had drawn it from the left hip,

00:26.495 --> 00:28.340
but it was peritoneal fluid.

00:28.767 --> 00:30.367
What is the matter with you?

00:30.488 --> 00:33.389
Did you see someone following
us when we got off the bus?

00:33.414 --> 00:35.038
No.

00:35.486 --> 00:37.046
I'm pretty sure I did.

00:37.071 --> 00:38.737
- Who?
- I don't know.

00:38.762 --> 00:40.756
I just can't shake this
feeling I'm being followed.

00:40.781 --> 00:42.362
Followed?

00:42.387 --> 00:43.898
I get it.

00:44.289 --> 00:47.329
Don't worry, it's not real.

00:48.275 --> 00:49.374
- What?
- You're a first year

00:49.399 --> 00:51.464
- psych resident.
- But what does that mean?

00:51.821 --> 00:53.862
You spend all day treating
very disturbed people.

00:53.887 --> 00:55.750
It's only natural that
you'd start mirroring

00:55.775 --> 00:58.578
some of their disorders.
For example, paranoia.

00:58.603 --> 00:59.974
I don't know.

01:00.104 --> 01:03.073
That sounds kind of condescending.

01:03.562 --> 01:05.446
Stacking up here, Maggie,
you need to get these patients

01:05.471 --> 01:06.613
to the medical force.

01:06.638 --> 01:08.464
Really?
Sorry, Dr. Choi, I didn't notice.

01:08.711 --> 01:10.943
Dr. Manning, Hayley Kline, incoming.

01:12.893 --> 01:15.343
Adolescent female,
on chemo for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

01:15.368 --> 01:16.901
- No, no, no, Baghdad.
- Okay.

01:16.926 --> 01:18.348
Dr. Manning, thank God you're here.

01:18.373 --> 01:19.744
Stop the shoes. No shoes.

01:19.769 --> 01:22.103
- Honey, I don't understand.
- She's been talking nonsense.

01:22.128 --> 01:25.695
GCS 10, altered mental status,
mostly incoherent.

01:25.720 --> 01:26.886
New onset of jaundice.

01:26.911 --> 01:27.786
- April?
- Got it.

01:27.811 --> 01:29.844
Her eyes, they're... They're yellow.

01:29.892 --> 01:31.644
Hayley, honey, it's Dr. Manning.

01:31.669 --> 01:32.788
Do you remember me?

01:32.813 --> 01:34.270
I can't find my...

01:34.295 --> 01:36.062
- What's wrong with her?
- We're gonna find out.

01:36.087 --> 01:38.784
No rain. No. No.

01:39.175 --> 01:40.593
Let's hang a liter of NS

01:40.618 --> 01:42.701
and draw a CBC, BMP, LFT, and lytes.

01:42.726 --> 01:43.386
On it.

01:43.411 --> 01:44.883
When was her last dose of chemo?

01:44.908 --> 01:45.862
Few days ago, I think.

01:45.887 --> 01:46.807
A week, actually.

01:46.832 --> 01:49.269
Sweetie, honey.

01:49.294 --> 01:50.731
She could be in liver failure,

01:50.756 --> 01:52.596
which could be causing
her brain to swell.

01:52.621 --> 01:53.626
No.

01:53.651 --> 01:55.689
GCS is worsening.
We need to intubate, protect her airway.

01:55.714 --> 01:56.987
I got it.

01:57.797 --> 01:59.285
Do what you gotta do.

01:59.310 --> 02:01.039
10 of etomidate and a 75 of sux.

02:01.064 --> 02:01.949
Yup.

02:05.560 --> 02:06.559
Nine percent.

02:10.680 --> 02:12.036
I'm in.

02:12.323 --> 02:14.835
Let's get a head CT and belly,
hyperventilate

02:14.860 --> 02:16.862
and get labs now with
an acetaminophen level.

02:16.887 --> 02:18.002
- Got it.
- Call 'em and tell 'em

02:18.027 --> 02:19.129
we're on our way up, we don't have time.

02:19.153 --> 02:21.153
You can come with us. Let's go.

02:22.529 --> 02:24.229
Hang in there, Hayley.

02:32.381 --> 02:34.029
- I need those meds.
- You paged?

02:34.054 --> 02:37.437
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:37.937 --> 02:40.743
We're jammed and there's
no beds upstairs.

02:40.768 --> 02:42.339
I hate to say it, but maybe we should...

02:42.364 --> 02:44.475
We're not diverting
patients to other hospitals.

02:44.500 --> 02:45.235
I'm just saying...

02:45.260 --> 02:46.925
Maggie, we're not going on bypass.

02:46.950 --> 02:49.463
If the medical floors are filled,
call the ICUs,

02:49.488 --> 02:51.709
put patients there until
beds are available.

02:51.734 --> 02:52.800
I'll try.

02:52.825 --> 02:54.367
Sorry for the lack of privacy.

02:54.392 --> 02:57.034
No problem.
I just want to get outta here.

02:57.059 --> 02:58.380
When did the pain start?

02:58.481 --> 03:00.291
About a half hour ago.

03:00.532 --> 03:01.991
I was gonna ignore it,

03:02.016 --> 03:04.317
but my neighbor, he's a nurse,

03:04.342 --> 03:06.157
and so he said I should
get it checked out.

03:06.299 --> 03:07.731
I don't like hospitals.

03:07.756 --> 03:09.676
I hear ya. Where exactly is the pain?

03:09.983 --> 03:12.074
Here. The belly button.

03:12.547 --> 03:14.048
Dr. Halstead?

03:16.164 --> 03:18.431
Mr. Logan, do you have
a history of A-fib?

03:18.784 --> 03:20.088
What's that?

03:20.113 --> 03:21.919
An irregular heartbeat.

03:22.314 --> 03:24.430
No. Is it serious?

03:24.455 --> 03:27.310
Very common,
but something we should look into.

03:27.528 --> 03:29.914
What about this? This hurt?

03:30.034 --> 03:31.357
No.

03:31.831 --> 03:33.798
- This?
- Yeah, there.

03:33.823 --> 03:37.491
Well, good news, your belly's
soft and you're not guarding,

03:37.516 --> 03:39.391
meaning you're not
tensing when I touch you.

03:39.492 --> 03:41.680
So it's probably nothing, right?

03:41.705 --> 03:43.892
I mean, it's probably something I ate.

03:43.917 --> 03:46.944
I hope so, but let's just...
Let's just be safe.

03:48.668 --> 03:51.434
Let's order a chest
x-ray, KUB and lactate,

03:51.459 --> 03:54.097
CBC, amylase lipase,
check his basic chemistry.

03:54.122 --> 03:55.001
Right.

03:55.026 --> 03:56.558
How long is that all gonna take?

03:56.835 --> 03:58.402
Do you know, not long.

03:58.427 --> 04:00.135
We'll get you outta here
as soon as possible.

04:08.236 --> 04:10.443
Tolerated the surgery well, Mr. Collins.

04:10.468 --> 04:11.535
Your chest sounds good.

04:11.560 --> 04:12.498
That's great.

04:12.523 --> 04:14.039
Let me.

04:16.000 --> 04:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:30.302 --> 04:32.001
Mr. Collins, we're gonna have to redo

04:32.026 --> 04:34.197
your aortic valve replacement.

04:34.222 --> 04:35.779
- What?
- Dr. Latham?

04:35.804 --> 04:37.261
Apical systolic murmur.

04:37.286 --> 04:38.452
I didn't hear it.

04:38.477 --> 04:39.570
It's subtle.

04:50.091 --> 04:52.195
I'm sorry, I still don't hear it.

04:52.639 --> 04:54.208
Call the OR, have them set up

04:54.233 --> 04:55.932
for an emergent aortic valve take back.

04:55.957 --> 04:57.363
Right away.

04:57.388 --> 04:59.421
You're gonna have to
operate again, really?

04:59.446 --> 05:01.980
Dr. Latham, if I may. Excuse us.

05:06.004 --> 05:07.904
We're gonna put him through it again?

05:07.929 --> 05:10.263
Shouldn't we at least
get an echo to confirm?

05:10.361 --> 05:11.722
The valve will fail.

05:11.747 --> 05:13.388
If you need to assuage your doubts,

05:13.413 --> 05:14.952
we can do an echo on the table.

05:14.977 --> 05:16.867
Meanwhile, I'm changing into my scrubs.

05:22.435 --> 05:25.197
Here is the reason for your tummy ache,
Shannon.

05:25.222 --> 05:27.355
You have an obstruction in your stomach.

05:27.380 --> 05:28.396
Dear.

05:28.421 --> 05:31.358
It's not a growth.
It's clearly a foreign object.

05:31.383 --> 05:32.382
What did you eat?

05:32.407 --> 05:33.582
Nothing.

05:34.467 --> 05:36.023
You must have swallowed something.

05:36.048 --> 05:37.913
It's the only way it
could've gotten there.

05:37.938 --> 05:39.538
I don't know.

05:39.563 --> 05:41.369
Honey, think. What could it be?

05:41.591 --> 05:43.454
I had some of those little carrots.

05:43.567 --> 05:46.200
No, a carrot wouldn't reflect x-rays.

05:46.225 --> 05:47.233
This is dense.

05:47.258 --> 05:50.359
It's metal or ceramic,
maybe some kind of toy.

05:50.434 --> 05:53.261
- Honey?
- I don't know.

05:53.567 --> 05:55.350
Won't it just come out eventually?

05:55.375 --> 05:57.190
You know, peristalsis.

05:59.719 --> 06:00.866
Well, whatever this is,

06:00.891 --> 06:02.391
I don't want it moving through you.

06:02.416 --> 06:04.779
It could cut the bowel,
and that would be serious.

06:05.098 --> 06:08.311
With your permission,
I'd like Shannon the have an endoscopy.

06:08.336 --> 06:10.469
We'll sedate her,
put a scope down her esophagus,

06:10.494 --> 06:11.777
and get the thing out.

06:12.324 --> 06:13.916
It shouldn't be a problem.

06:14.498 --> 06:16.288
- God.
- Don't worry.

06:16.313 --> 06:17.828
It'll be over before you know it.

06:17.895 --> 06:19.278
All right.

06:23.320 --> 06:25.567
Well, you were right,
Diffuse cerebral edema

06:25.592 --> 06:27.739
with effacement of the
sulci and ventricles.

06:27.879 --> 06:29.260
Yeah.

06:29.715 --> 06:31.543
Get her up to PICU.

06:42.808 --> 06:45.769
I'm sorry, but the CT shows that

06:45.794 --> 06:48.323
there is significant
swelling in Hayley's brain.

06:48.675 --> 06:51.001
The cause is acute liver failure.

06:51.562 --> 06:52.892
Acute?

06:53.306 --> 06:55.183
There are things we can do for her.

06:55.208 --> 06:58.744
We have her on medication that
will help reduce the swelling.

06:58.769 --> 07:00.963
This is Dr. Abrams, he's a neurosurgeon.

07:00.988 --> 07:01.849
I've called him to consult.

07:01.874 --> 07:03.319
I'm gonna put in a drain to relieve

07:03.344 --> 07:04.689
the pressure on your daughter's brain.

07:04.714 --> 07:06.635
With your permission, of course.

07:06.859 --> 07:09.326
Are you talking about brain surgery?

07:09.351 --> 07:12.003
I do it bedside.
It's not a difficult procedure.

07:13.200 --> 07:14.327
My baby.

07:14.647 --> 07:17.147
My poor baby.

07:17.172 --> 07:19.423
It's okay, honey.

07:19.949 --> 07:22.366
We are gonna do everything
that we can for her.

07:23.954 --> 07:26.719
I...

07:34.161 --> 07:35.907
Chicken salad, chicken wings,
chicken tenders.

07:35.932 --> 07:37.718
Don't you have anything without chicken?

07:37.743 --> 07:39.736
Dude, can you read the sign?

07:39.761 --> 07:42.257
We only do chicken,
and we do it "clucking" well.

07:42.371 --> 07:43.674
Next!

07:44.670 --> 07:46.381
You don't eat chicken anymore?

07:46.406 --> 07:48.290
Since I got my parrot, you know,

07:48.315 --> 07:50.180
eating birds doesn't feel right.

07:51.877 --> 07:54.734
Can I get chicken tenders?

08:06.592 --> 08:08.357
Dr. Reese?

08:09.811 --> 08:11.328
Danny.

08:12.149 --> 08:14.156
You've been following me.

08:14.819 --> 08:16.762
I had to talk to you.

08:17.496 --> 08:19.483
Well... Mmhmm.

08:19.701 --> 08:20.934
You were nice to me.

08:20.959 --> 08:23.404
We know what's going
on. That woman with you

08:23.429 --> 08:25.503
was not your mother and
you're being sex trafficked.

08:26.013 --> 08:29.790
They make me do things
that I don't want to do.

08:29.815 --> 08:31.244
We can help you, Danny.

08:31.270 --> 08:32.535
No.

08:32.561 --> 08:34.431
No, nobody can.

08:34.770 --> 08:37.663
But you came to me. Why?

08:38.231 --> 08:41.111
I can't take it anymore.

08:42.668 --> 08:44.377
I want to kill myself.

08:50.391 --> 08:52.723
I twisted arms, got a few beds,
but we're still shy,

08:52.748 --> 08:54.136
but I'm sure there's more up there.

08:54.261 --> 08:55.675
You know how those ICU nurses are.

08:55.700 --> 08:57.013
They always keep spares for emergency.

08:57.038 --> 08:58.771
Yeah, right. We both played that game.

08:58.796 --> 08:59.945
Go up there, light a fire.

08:59.970 --> 09:02.009
If you get any push-back, call me.

09:02.034 --> 09:03.067
Will do.

09:04.681 --> 09:06.480
Danny said he'd get back in touch.

09:06.505 --> 09:09.042
When he does, you should
refer him to the psych clinic.

09:09.067 --> 09:10.558
Well, he won't go. He's afraid to come

09:10.583 --> 09:12.382
into the hospital or any clinic.

09:12.407 --> 09:14.247
He's afraid the
traffickers will find out

09:14.272 --> 09:16.205
and he only wants to see me outside.

09:16.230 --> 09:17.630
Bad idea.

09:18.430 --> 09:20.311
Dr. Charles, he's suicidal.

09:20.615 --> 09:23.269
So, let me get this straight.

09:23.294 --> 09:25.853
You are gonna give him psychotherapy

09:25.878 --> 09:27.758
in the parking lot once a week?

09:28.289 --> 09:30.430
Dr. Reese, this patient... Any patient

09:30.611 --> 09:32.764
has gotta be treated in the
proper clinical setting.

09:32.789 --> 09:34.729
He feels a connection to me.

09:35.645 --> 09:37.148
Let me ask you something.

09:37.940 --> 09:39.834
You feel like you're the
only one who can help?

09:40.283 --> 09:42.529
Only one who understands him?

09:42.554 --> 09:43.720
No. No, it's just...

09:43.745 --> 09:44.966
Just what?

09:46.182 --> 09:47.682
I care about him.

09:47.787 --> 09:49.257
Cut it off. You're too involved.

09:49.283 --> 09:52.214
But I-I-I don't understand.

09:52.239 --> 09:53.338
What happens if you don't get

09:53.363 --> 09:55.539
the rosy outcome you're looking for?

09:55.564 --> 09:56.732
I think I can deal with that.

09:56.757 --> 09:59.892
No. Crucial part of my job

09:59.917 --> 10:01.383
is protecting my staff.

10:01.677 --> 10:03.440
You are headed down a dangerous path.

10:03.465 --> 10:04.497
Step away.

10:06.631 --> 10:07.931
We clear?

10:10.020 --> 10:11.541
Good.

10:15.286 --> 10:17.225
Mr. Logan's lab work.

10:18.130 --> 10:20.353
Albumin's a little low,
creatinine a little high.

10:20.378 --> 10:22.450
Yeah, so's his lactate.

10:23.006 --> 10:25.106
- Yeah, thanks, April.
- Yeah.

10:25.130 --> 10:27.130
Mr. Logan. How are you feeling?

10:27.155 --> 10:28.521
Pretty good.

10:28.546 --> 10:30.346
And the pain in your belly?

10:30.376 --> 10:32.327
That's about the same. No worries.

10:32.478 --> 10:34.756
I'd sure like to get outta here.

10:35.929 --> 10:38.592
This is a...
this is the last X-Ray of your abdomen.

10:38.617 --> 10:41.704
It shows some vague dilation,
not enough to be a real concern,

10:41.729 --> 10:45.580
but your labs too,
they're just slightly off the norm.

10:46.234 --> 10:47.602
So?

10:47.724 --> 10:49.990
So I'm not comfortable
discharging you just yet,

10:50.231 --> 10:52.066
till I know for sure what's going on.

10:52.174 --> 10:54.441
I'd like to do a CT
scan of your abdomen.

10:54.538 --> 10:56.038
Really?

10:56.797 --> 10:58.180
Humor me.

10:59.674 --> 11:02.574
Fine. Whatever you say.

11:02.599 --> 11:03.631
All right.

11:12.380 --> 11:14.456
Sternum closing looks good.

11:14.577 --> 11:16.796
Dr. Bardovi, any help with closing skin?

11:16.821 --> 11:17.892
No, sir.

11:18.142 --> 11:21.633
Amazing how effortlessly
you throw 8-0 stitches.

11:22.233 --> 11:24.009
You too, Dr. Rhodes.

11:39.617 --> 11:41.347
Hey.

11:41.695 --> 11:43.349
Hey.

11:54.520 --> 11:56.548
Your friend, Izzy Latham,

11:57.097 --> 11:58.910
that guy hears heart sounds

11:58.935 --> 12:01.200
that are practically undetectable.

12:02.338 --> 12:03.805
It's the same when we play music.

12:03.830 --> 12:05.242
He has an unbelievable ear.

12:05.267 --> 12:07.539
I mean, my hearing is good,

12:07.564 --> 12:09.913
but this patient today,

12:10.051 --> 12:11.856
Latham caught a murmur, I didn't.

12:11.881 --> 12:14.919
It just sounded fine to me.

12:17.096 --> 12:18.952
Yeah, he's not Superman, you know?

12:18.977 --> 12:20.844
I mean, knowing Izzy,
he's worked very hard at it,

12:20.869 --> 12:22.221
probably listened to a lot of hearts.

12:22.246 --> 12:24.076
But you're a first-year fellow.
You'll get it.

12:24.101 --> 12:25.478
- Hey, Nat?
- Yeah?

12:25.503 --> 12:27.502
I pulled this out of the
gut of a 14-year-old girl.

12:27.527 --> 12:28.476
Any idea what it is?

12:28.501 --> 12:30.575
I've never seen anything like it.

12:30.600 --> 12:31.836
Me neither.

12:32.012 --> 12:34.390
- Care to find out?
- Yeah.

12:38.240 --> 12:40.566
Shannon, Mrs. Fisher,
this is Dr. Manning.

12:40.591 --> 12:41.618
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:41.643 --> 12:43.943
We removed this foreign
body from your stomach.

12:43.968 --> 12:45.168
That was inside her?

12:45.194 --> 12:46.425
What is it?

12:47.358 --> 12:48.814
Shannon.

12:48.839 --> 12:50.545
It's mine, I need it back.

12:50.570 --> 12:51.935
Is that something you
made in the basement?

12:51.960 --> 12:53.677
You made that?

12:54.064 --> 12:55.773
Tell them what it is.

12:57.399 --> 12:58.863
It's a prototype.

12:58.946 --> 13:00.245
For what?

13:00.270 --> 13:02.165
- A robot.
- A robot?

13:02.324 --> 13:04.450
The idea is, you swallow it.

13:04.475 --> 13:05.861
You swallowed that?

13:05.886 --> 13:07.443
And it can clear blockages

13:07.468 --> 13:09.407
or repair intestinal
wall without surgery.

13:09.432 --> 13:12.060
Excuse me, clear blockages?
It caused a blockage.

13:12.240 --> 13:13.934
Okay, so it needs work.

13:13.959 --> 13:17.093
What exactly goes on in your basement?

13:17.213 --> 13:20.514
Shannon and her friends,
they call themselves bio-hackers.

13:20.771 --> 13:24.581
I'm a body-hacker.
Kyle and Jen are bio-hackers.

13:24.780 --> 13:26.683
Bio-hackers, genetic engineering,

13:26.708 --> 13:27.939
a bunch of kids?

13:27.964 --> 13:29.948
They make things, the DIY generation,

13:29.973 --> 13:31.389
turned our basement into a lab.

13:31.414 --> 13:33.353
I can hardly get to the washing machine.

13:33.378 --> 13:36.146
And I do not want you
experimenting on yourself.

13:36.224 --> 13:37.822
- I'll second that.
- Yeah, seriously,

13:37.847 --> 13:39.348
this was very dangerous.

13:39.373 --> 13:41.278
You could have cost
yourself an operation.

13:41.388 --> 13:43.892
You listen to the doctors.

13:45.001 --> 13:46.767
Can I have it back?

13:48.719 --> 13:50.068
Please?

13:54.253 --> 13:55.753
That's up to your mom.

14:01.588 --> 14:02.659
Body hacking?

14:02.684 --> 14:04.089
They could really hurt themselves.

14:04.114 --> 14:05.562
Shouldn't we report this to someone?

14:05.587 --> 14:06.935
Who? It's not illegal.

14:06.960 --> 14:07.805
It's just crazy.

14:07.830 --> 14:08.969
- Excuse me.
- Kids, where do they

14:08.994 --> 14:10.036
get these ideas?

14:10.061 --> 14:11.338
Listen to me, I sound like my dad.

14:11.362 --> 14:12.561
Your dad would be right.

14:12.586 --> 14:14.519
Still, makes you wonder
what goes on there.

14:14.544 --> 14:16.832
- See ya.
- Thanks.

14:19.039 --> 14:20.827
I just came from 3 West.

14:20.852 --> 14:22.317
They said they have a Mr. Isaac Johnson

14:22.342 --> 14:24.408
who was just transferred from your ICU.

14:24.433 --> 14:25.899
How can he still be listed there?

14:25.924 --> 14:27.218
You should have a free bed.

14:27.243 --> 14:28.535
We just didn't get around
to clearing the computer,

14:28.560 --> 14:30.815
but we already gave that
bed to an ortho patient.

14:31.668 --> 14:34.770
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:37.812 --> 14:39.335
What about that room?

14:39.360 --> 14:41.600
- That's the red room.
- The red room?

14:41.625 --> 14:43.065
That's what the docs call it.

14:43.337 --> 14:45.166
They won't let us put
their patients there.

14:45.191 --> 14:46.144
Why?

14:46.168 --> 14:47.388
They think it's bad luck.

14:47.696 --> 14:48.874
Say what?

14:48.899 --> 14:51.063
Three patients have died in
there in the last two weeks.

14:51.087 --> 14:53.294
- They think it's bad luck.
- Doctors.

14:53.524 --> 14:55.086
Nguyen won't operate
without orange socks,

14:55.111 --> 14:57.245
Bernstein's gotta play "Mandy"
in every single surgery...

14:57.270 --> 14:59.632
Drives the OR nurses nuts, and now this.

15:02.919 --> 15:04.149
Dr. Rhodes.

15:04.326 --> 15:06.358
I see you got a patient in the SICU.

15:06.503 --> 15:08.799
Emergent redo aortic valve.

15:10.170 --> 15:11.970
How do you feel about transferring him

15:11.995 --> 15:13.494
into that room?

15:15.233 --> 15:17.034
Given the choice, I'd rather not.

15:17.076 --> 15:18.309
Really, Dr. Rhodes, you?

15:18.334 --> 15:19.700
Why take a chance?

15:21.465 --> 15:23.853
All right, let's fight fire with fire.

15:24.436 --> 15:26.365
You know that Hawaiian guy
that you talked to me about?

15:26.390 --> 15:27.412
Yeah, Keoni?

15:27.437 --> 15:28.519
Yeah, the one who owns the bar.

15:28.544 --> 15:29.333
Yeah.

15:29.393 --> 15:31.469
Can you put me in touch with him?

15:32.916 --> 15:34.082
Yeah, sure.

15:34.107 --> 15:36.141
Thank you.

15:41.814 --> 15:45.149
Okay, so since you couldn't
tolerate the oral contrast,

15:45.174 --> 15:47.737
the images are non-specific...
We can't tell much.

15:47.762 --> 15:51.085
Luckily, there's no evidence
of perforation or free fluid.

15:51.110 --> 15:53.425
And you know what? That
pain I was feeling,

15:53.450 --> 15:54.482
it's gone.

15:56.142 --> 15:58.175
- Really?
- Yeah.

16:07.433 --> 16:09.355
That doesn't hurt at all.

16:09.380 --> 16:11.688
So, I can go home, right?

16:13.964 --> 16:16.937
I'm sorry, no.
I think you need an operation.

16:16.962 --> 16:18.361
Surgery?

16:18.418 --> 16:19.482
Immediately.

16:19.507 --> 16:22.242
No, no, I told you, it
doesn't hurt anymore.

16:22.267 --> 16:24.196
Well, in this case,
that's not a good sign.

16:24.221 --> 16:26.034
When a section of the bowel dies,

16:26.059 --> 16:27.387
at first you can't feel it.

16:27.412 --> 16:29.179
We need to remove that section
while there's still time,

16:29.204 --> 16:30.703
otherwise it could be fatal.

16:30.728 --> 16:31.727
Page Dr. Rhodes right now.

16:38.031 --> 16:39.866
How long has she been on chemo?

16:40.149 --> 16:42.094
Multiple courses over the last year.

16:42.119 --> 16:43.995
To get to this.

16:44.647 --> 16:46.981
We're still in the Dark Ages.

16:47.006 --> 16:50.338
Done.

16:50.966 --> 16:53.256
Peds cases.

17:00.188 --> 17:02.155
You can go in now.

17:02.180 --> 17:03.620
How is she?

17:04.190 --> 17:05.289
Um...

17:08.117 --> 17:09.650
It's too soon to tell.

17:09.923 --> 17:11.557
While we have her on dialysis,

17:11.582 --> 17:13.701
that'll take over the
function of her liver.

17:13.726 --> 17:16.333
Is our daughter dying?

17:16.608 --> 17:19.214
No.

17:19.575 --> 17:21.124
No, she's not.

17:22.200 --> 17:26.506
With dialysis she will stabilize
and her labs should improve.

17:26.916 --> 17:29.150
Unfortunately, the...

17:29.846 --> 17:31.902
the damage to her liver
could be permanent.

17:31.990 --> 17:33.222
She may need a transplant.

17:33.247 --> 17:34.865
My God, a liver transplant?

17:34.913 --> 17:36.090
Another operation?

17:36.122 --> 17:37.412
- I know...
- She's been through so much.

17:37.437 --> 17:40.394
I know. I know, but...

17:41.478 --> 17:43.118
Hayley's a fighter.

17:43.839 --> 17:46.830
I've seen these things turn around.

17:47.258 --> 17:50.169
We're not giving up.
She could pull out of this.

17:50.194 --> 17:51.420
Thank you.

18:00.379 --> 18:02.149
Little more. Toward me.

18:06.042 --> 18:07.308
We're on borrowed time right now.

18:07.333 --> 18:08.365
- We need to get him up there now.
- No, look, I am looking

18:08.390 --> 18:10.124
at the scan myself and I am telling you

18:10.149 --> 18:11.816
I am not taking him up for surgery.

18:11.841 --> 18:13.641
Connor, he's got an ischemic bowel.

18:13.666 --> 18:14.924
So show me the scan.

18:14.949 --> 18:16.882
- It's inconclusive.
- Exactly.

18:16.907 --> 18:20.118
So you are asking me to take
him up for a laparoscopy...

18:20.143 --> 18:22.844
Possibly an open laparotomy...
On what, your hunch?

18:22.869 --> 18:25.209
Okay, look, he was in
A-fib when he came in.

18:25.234 --> 18:27.097
Made me think right off,

18:27.121 --> 18:28.645
a clot had embolized to the gut.

18:28.670 --> 18:31.337
Now his bowel sounds are
gone and he's distended.

18:31.362 --> 18:33.195
The differential for
what you're describing

18:33.220 --> 18:36.736
is a mile long... gastroenteritus
to inflammatory bowel disease.

18:36.762 --> 18:38.945
This man's bowel is dying.

18:39.342 --> 18:41.423
I felt it with my hands.

18:41.795 --> 18:43.448
Your hands?

18:44.388 --> 18:45.628
Yes.

18:56.493 --> 18:57.959
If it wasn't for what
I just went through

18:57.984 --> 19:00.401
with Latham today, I would say no.

19:01.111 --> 19:04.784
Fine, but for both our sakes,
I hope you're right.

19:14.643 --> 19:16.392
Hey, Dr. Charles.

19:17.484 --> 19:18.851
Do you have a second?

19:18.901 --> 19:21.023
Of course.

19:22.021 --> 19:24.839
I did something today
that I shouldn't have.

19:27.173 --> 19:29.659
I have a patient, an 11-year-old girl...

19:29.684 --> 19:31.272
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

19:31.297 --> 19:33.062
I've been treating
her for some time now.

19:33.087 --> 19:34.378
Her name's Hayley.

19:35.165 --> 19:37.949
She came back in today
in acute liver failure

19:37.974 --> 19:40.254
with acute cerebral edema.

19:40.667 --> 19:42.692
- Sorry to hear it.
- Yeah.

19:43.276 --> 19:45.409
Dr. Abrams put in a ventricular drain.

19:45.434 --> 19:48.381
We've got her on liver dialysis,
waiting for a transplant.

19:48.458 --> 19:50.140
Sounds about right.

19:50.754 --> 19:52.982
This, on top of her lymphoma,

19:53.007 --> 19:56.349
I mean, she is in very bad shape,
Dr. Charles.

19:56.509 --> 20:00.511
Like... and I told her parents
that she could pull out of it,

20:00.536 --> 20:02.584
that I've seen it happen before.

20:02.900 --> 20:04.374
Haven't you?

20:04.399 --> 20:07.518
I gave them hope and I
don't think there is any.

20:07.543 --> 20:09.242
Well, you really know that, though?

20:09.267 --> 20:12.320
I didn't give them an honest assessment,
though.

20:12.345 --> 20:14.012
I let my feelings get in the way

20:14.037 --> 20:17.467
because I so much want
Hayley to pull through.

20:17.656 --> 20:20.152
I didn't act professionally.
I didn't prepare them for...

20:20.177 --> 20:23.235
Nat, you can't torture yourself.

20:24.758 --> 20:27.611
Really hard drawing
these lines, you know?

20:27.635 --> 20:31.354
When do we know we've
become too involved?

20:32.196 --> 20:34.707
At the very least,
you can't fault yourself for caring.

20:34.974 --> 20:36.519
You know? I don't think

20:36.544 --> 20:40.296
Hayley's parents would
want anything less.

20:40.892 --> 20:42.268
Right?

20:43.397 --> 20:44.930
Yeah.

20:47.264 --> 20:48.797
Yeah.

20:50.257 --> 20:51.790
Thank you.

21:00.890 --> 21:03.344
Dr. Reese, got a second?

21:06.768 --> 21:09.602
Years ago, I had a private practice.

21:09.627 --> 21:11.920
I saw patients on a regular basis.

21:12.148 --> 21:14.914
One of them was a musician,

21:15.154 --> 21:17.404
young lady in her 20s,

21:17.664 --> 21:19.190
talented, funny,

21:19.433 --> 21:22.746
suffered from bouts of
depression and anxiety,

21:22.771 --> 21:23.970
but we were working through it.

21:23.995 --> 21:25.966
You know, she's a brave lady.

21:26.486 --> 21:28.233
Really liked her,

21:28.595 --> 21:30.929
looked forward to our sessions together.

21:32.734 --> 21:34.902
One night, I got a phone call.

21:34.927 --> 21:36.865
3:00 a.m.

21:38.349 --> 21:40.422
She had...

21:41.694 --> 21:43.897
jumped off the roof of her building.

21:44.900 --> 21:46.500
Left a note.

21:46.629 --> 21:48.537
"Sorry, I'm done."

21:51.785 --> 21:54.351
I couldn't understand
why she killed herself.

21:54.755 --> 21:56.636
You know. Went over my notes,

21:56.661 --> 21:58.715
looking for cues, you know,

21:58.740 --> 22:01.741
things I could've done differently...

22:01.766 --> 22:05.545
Replayed our conversations
over and over in my head,

22:05.965 --> 22:09.246
wondering what I could've said or done.

22:12.573 --> 22:14.303
Never got over it.

22:14.566 --> 22:16.451
Sold my practice, you know,

22:16.476 --> 22:19.802
went into emergency psychiatry.

22:20.216 --> 22:23.527
Swore I would never get that involved

22:23.552 --> 22:25.445
in anyone's life again.

22:26.898 --> 22:30.277
Look, Sarah, it was wrong of me

22:30.302 --> 22:32.951
to dismiss your feelings for Danny.

22:32.976 --> 22:36.310
You know, my issues are my issues,
not yours.

22:37.362 --> 22:40.431
Look, I really need you to trust me.

22:40.835 --> 22:43.192
Seeing him outside a clinical setting

22:43.217 --> 22:46.224
is a terrible idea,

22:46.745 --> 22:49.231
especially given the
people he's involved with.

22:50.024 --> 22:51.240
But...

22:53.495 --> 22:54.789
But if you insist on...

22:54.814 --> 22:56.124
I do.

23:00.596 --> 23:02.350
Well, then grab your coat,

23:02.576 --> 23:05.483
'cause I want to introduce
you to someone who can help,

23:05.508 --> 23:06.911
the right way.

23:11.796 --> 23:14.296
Inject the indocyanine green, please.

23:18.998 --> 23:20.365
Going in.

23:20.390 --> 23:22.423
Let's get the lights.

23:25.149 --> 23:26.597
The area that's not lit up

23:26.622 --> 23:29.379
is about a foot and
a half of dead bowel.

23:30.224 --> 23:31.713
Lights, please.

23:33.008 --> 23:34.507
You were right.

23:34.532 --> 23:36.433
Gotta open him up.

23:55.187 --> 23:58.722
So this hypothetical patient... Female?

23:58.747 --> 24:00.754
Male, hypothetically.

24:01.186 --> 24:02.511
Okay.

24:04.191 --> 24:07.242
And you say he was implanted
with a tracking device?

24:07.530 --> 24:09.226
Yes.

24:11.082 --> 24:13.297
Innovative.

24:13.589 --> 24:17.383
We...
we usually see human trafficking victims

24:17.408 --> 24:21.165
who've been branded or tattooed,
but not this.

24:23.257 --> 24:24.715
How old is he?

24:24.991 --> 24:26.517
Um...

24:27.225 --> 24:31.041
We don't have consent
to get any more specific.

24:31.066 --> 24:32.600
Sure.

24:35.136 --> 24:37.437
You want to help this
boy get out of the life.

24:37.898 --> 24:40.021
It's complicated.

24:40.731 --> 24:45.522
Traffickers control their
victims in a number of ways...

24:45.547 --> 24:49.812
Psychologically through
fear and emotional abuse...

24:49.837 --> 24:51.349
And physically.

24:51.859 --> 24:53.436
Drugs.

24:53.472 --> 24:55.340
Torture.

24:56.211 --> 24:58.280
He's up against a lot.

24:58.890 --> 25:00.523
I think it'll help him open up

25:00.548 --> 25:02.367
if he feels like he can trust you.

25:02.392 --> 25:04.359
Pretty sure he already does.

25:06.301 --> 25:07.728
Great.

25:08.424 --> 25:12.126
Once he tells you that
he's ready to involve us,

25:12.174 --> 25:14.022
just call me, and we'll start

25:14.047 --> 25:15.800
looking at ways to extricate him,

25:15.825 --> 25:17.558
but in the meantime,

25:17.583 --> 25:19.875
you have to be really careful.

25:20.612 --> 25:22.555
His fears are legitimate.

25:22.868 --> 25:26.072
If these traffickers find out
that he's trying to get out...

25:26.377 --> 25:30.298
That he could potentially
become a witness against them...

25:30.323 --> 25:31.796
They'll kill him.

25:38.175 --> 25:39.479
Dr. Abrams?

25:39.504 --> 25:41.111
Tell me if you concur.

25:48.100 --> 25:51.202
Her pupils are large, sluggish.

25:51.227 --> 25:52.840
What does that mean?

25:53.297 --> 25:54.437
No.

25:54.462 --> 25:56.626
Wait. Wait.

26:05.035 --> 26:06.898
What aren't you telling us?

26:06.923 --> 26:09.075
Unfortunately,
the swelling in your daughter's brain

26:09.100 --> 26:11.742
is so severe that it's
affecting the brain stem.

26:11.768 --> 26:13.223
B.P.'s spiking.

26:13.248 --> 26:15.268
200 over 100, heart rate's falling.

26:16.470 --> 26:17.795
- She's crashing.
- Call a code.

26:17.820 --> 26:19.538
She's in v-fib! 1 milligram of epi,

26:19.563 --> 26:22.088
charge to 200!

26:22.113 --> 26:24.689
Now! Hold compressions.

26:24.714 --> 26:25.638
Clear.

26:28.579 --> 26:31.128
Still in v-fib.

26:31.222 --> 26:33.510
Charge for 200, another
milligram of epi.

26:33.535 --> 26:34.986
Hold compressions.

26:35.652 --> 26:36.651
Clear.

26:38.134 --> 26:40.621
V-fib's... fine v-fib.

26:42.023 --> 26:43.489
Asystole.

26:54.333 --> 26:56.752
I'm so sorry. She's gone.

26:56.777 --> 26:58.143
- Gone?
- Are you... are you sure?

26:58.168 --> 27:00.669
Yes. Yes. May we stop?

27:00.694 --> 27:02.239
Stop?

27:02.264 --> 27:04.542
I need your permission.

27:05.284 --> 27:07.948
Yes, please, for God's sake, let her be.

27:07.973 --> 27:10.820
No, no, no. No, no, no, come on.

27:10.845 --> 27:12.626
Come on, baby, come on.

27:12.651 --> 27:15.050
Baby, come on.

27:15.075 --> 27:17.981
No! No! No!

27:43.097 --> 27:44.700
I hope this isn't inconvenient.

27:44.725 --> 27:46.640
I'm just concerned about
what Shannon and her friends

27:46.665 --> 27:47.664
are up to.

27:47.689 --> 27:48.841
Believe me, they won't mind.

27:48.866 --> 27:51.935
They love to show off their lab,
little mad scientists.

27:53.349 --> 27:55.115
But you're very supportive.

27:55.140 --> 27:57.955
They get so excited.
They think they can do anything.

28:00.614 --> 28:03.508
Listen,
I had to give Shannon back that gizmo.

28:03.533 --> 28:06.397
She said she'd never
speak to me if I didn't.

28:08.754 --> 28:10.683
Shannon, look who's here.

28:15.420 --> 28:17.937
What you're describing...
The suicidal thoughts,

28:17.962 --> 28:22.191
the, um, sense of hopelessness,
lack of energy...

28:22.216 --> 28:24.554
These are all signs of depression.

28:24.916 --> 28:27.062
And I can prescribe you
medications that could help,

28:27.087 --> 28:30.516
but I think we need to address
something more fundamental.

28:30.541 --> 28:32.298
What do you mean?

28:32.937 --> 28:34.903
Hey, Danny, when we...

28:34.928 --> 28:37.006
When we examine a
patient who's in prison,

28:37.031 --> 28:40.127
we have to ask ourselves,
"Is this person really depressed"

28:40.152 --> 28:43.193
or are they just living in a
situation that is so awful,

28:43.218 --> 28:45.518
so inherently depressing,

28:45.543 --> 28:48.802
that any person would
have these feelings.

28:49.150 --> 28:51.008
So what I'm saying...

28:51.567 --> 28:53.803
Sorry, um...

28:53.962 --> 28:56.652
If you were living in
a better situation,

28:56.677 --> 28:58.763
you might not be depressed.

28:58.933 --> 29:01.568
You mean leave them?

29:01.824 --> 29:03.122
Yes.

29:03.147 --> 29:06.412
No. No, no, I-I can't.

29:06.452 --> 29:08.711
These people, they'll hurt me.

29:08.736 --> 29:10.569
We can protect you.

29:10.829 --> 29:12.805
What about the heroin?

29:12.894 --> 29:14.922
I need it, you know that.
They give it to me.

29:14.947 --> 29:17.430
We can get you off of heroin.
You won't need it anymore.

29:17.613 --> 29:20.755
They'll find me. They
will, they always do.

29:20.780 --> 29:22.590
Well, of course they do,
they put a tracking device...

29:22.615 --> 29:24.515
A chip in you, but we can take it out,

29:24.540 --> 29:25.806
and then they won't be able to find you.

29:25.831 --> 29:28.865
You don't know these people.
They're too smart.

29:28.890 --> 29:32.749
Okay, Danny, you don't have to
make any decisions right now.

29:32.774 --> 29:34.497
I just want you to know,
things can be different.

29:34.522 --> 29:36.289
This was a bad idea.
I shouldn't have come.

29:36.314 --> 29:37.681
- This was a bad idea. No!
- No, Danny. Danny!

29:37.706 --> 29:38.907
No!

30:09.059 --> 30:11.737
I heard. I'm sorry.

30:11.762 --> 30:12.691
Yeah.

30:15.802 --> 30:19.589
We ran the code,
all the time knowing it was hopeless.

30:19.679 --> 30:21.813
- Yeah.
- I failed her.

30:21.910 --> 30:24.574
- You did everything you could.
- No, I did everything I could,

30:24.599 --> 30:25.956
and it wasn't enough.

30:26.145 --> 30:28.942
I felt helpless, Ethan,

30:28.967 --> 30:31.704
watching that little girl slip away.

30:32.174 --> 30:35.843
How many more kids like Hayley
are we gonna have to lose?

30:38.251 --> 30:41.802
Nat, you know that patient of mine

30:41.827 --> 30:43.643
you saw today, Shannon?

30:43.668 --> 30:44.970
Yeah.

30:45.259 --> 30:48.925
I was worried about her,
so I went to see her lab.

30:49.213 --> 30:52.990
Nat, you can't believe it...
They're doing gene sequencing.

30:53.518 --> 30:56.583
One kid's trying to make
an affordable Hep C drug,

30:56.608 --> 30:58.790
another's trying to
bio-engineer chicken meat

30:58.905 --> 31:01.532
so we never have to
kill another chicken.

31:03.327 --> 31:04.961
Okay.

31:04.986 --> 31:07.126
These kids...

31:08.147 --> 31:09.913
are doing stuff in a basement

31:09.955 --> 31:12.455
that ten years ago you could only do

31:12.480 --> 31:14.639
at a major university or hospital lab.

31:17.223 --> 31:19.296
You should go.

31:20.011 --> 31:22.177
It'll make you feel better.

31:22.763 --> 31:25.096
Make me feel better?

31:27.213 --> 31:30.912
Nat, when we find the cure for cancer,

31:31.934 --> 31:34.901
it might just come out
of a lab like that one.

31:55.343 --> 31:56.876
Keoni.

31:56.901 --> 31:59.201
- Howzit, brah?
- Good, good.

31:59.226 --> 32:01.259
- That's the room?
- That's it.

32:21.097 --> 32:23.230
Not a healing atmosphere.

32:23.360 --> 32:24.575
Can you do anything?

32:24.600 --> 32:26.634
Yeah.

32:37.368 --> 32:38.568
What?

32:38.593 --> 32:41.179
You said he told you
that certain abilities

32:41.204 --> 32:42.277
ran in his family.

32:42.302 --> 32:44.035
The shaman thing? Seriously?

32:44.060 --> 32:47.320
Show some respect, Dr. Rhodes,
the term is "kahuna."

32:48.069 --> 32:51.070
And for a man who thinks
a room can be unlucky,

32:51.095 --> 32:53.128
you're one to judge.

32:55.306 --> 32:57.592
Just calm down. It's
okay, just calm down.

32:57.617 --> 33:00.030
Dr. Choi, incoming. Trauma 2's open.

33:00.055 --> 33:01.927
19-year-old male, found on the street

33:01.952 --> 33:03.451
with a self-inflicted
wound to the right flank.

33:03.476 --> 33:05.528
- Hey, Sarah!
- April, page Dr. Reese.

33:05.553 --> 33:07.120
- Yeah.
- GCS 15 but lethargic.

33:07.145 --> 33:08.551
BP 110 over 60,

33:08.576 --> 33:10.288
about 200 of blood loss at the scene.

33:10.313 --> 33:11.761
I need Dr. Reese!

33:16.739 --> 33:18.479
Looks superficial,

33:18.504 --> 33:19.503
but there's still a lot of bleeding.

33:19.528 --> 33:21.163
- Type and cross and hang a unit.
- Right.

33:21.188 --> 33:22.949
- And a liter of normal saline.
- Yup.

33:22.974 --> 33:24.432
Danny?

33:24.457 --> 33:25.908
He cut himself.

33:26.078 --> 33:27.371
Were you trying to kill yourself?

33:27.396 --> 33:29.995
No, I-I tried to cut it out... The chip.

33:30.020 --> 33:31.152
The chip?

33:31.177 --> 33:32.777
I want... I want to live.

33:32.802 --> 33:35.171
I want to get away from them. Help me.

33:35.196 --> 33:36.530
Okay.

33:41.530 --> 33:43.991
We're culturing gut bacteria over here.

33:44.016 --> 33:46.306
Maybe we can re-program
some E. coli Nissle

33:46.331 --> 33:48.254
to boost the immune system.

33:48.321 --> 33:50.808
But Nissle's not dangerous.

33:50.994 --> 33:53.680
Still, what level of safety
are you operating at?

33:53.775 --> 33:56.140
BSL-1. Maybe 1 1/2.

33:56.267 --> 33:58.404
What we're doing here
doesn't need more than that.

33:58.429 --> 34:00.759
And who's supervising all of this?

34:00.784 --> 34:03.585
Ms. Herbert, our biology teacher.

34:03.610 --> 34:05.591
But I don't think she really
gets what we're doing.

34:05.616 --> 34:08.141
She just tries to make sure
we don't kill ourselves.

34:08.652 --> 34:10.396
This is cool.

34:10.420 --> 34:12.454
Kyle, show her the ear.

34:13.726 --> 34:17.108
He took a slice of apple and
implanted it with HeLa cells.

34:17.719 --> 34:20.453
The cellulose in the apple
is kinda like scaffolding

34:20.478 --> 34:21.741
for the cells to grow on.

34:21.869 --> 34:23.643
Wow.

34:23.668 --> 34:25.902
That really looks like an ear.

34:26.203 --> 34:27.695
Well, it's not.

34:27.719 --> 34:29.672
I carved it to make it look like one.

34:29.697 --> 34:32.054
But it's not apple anymore either.

34:35.652 --> 34:37.656
Well, when I was your age, I was working

34:37.681 --> 34:39.579
with hippocampal cultures, studying

34:39.603 --> 34:42.675
the transduction pathways
with short interfering DNA.

34:43.369 --> 34:45.697
I know, big deal, so 1995.

34:45.722 --> 34:48.056
You were a science geek too?

34:48.081 --> 34:51.081
And I would've killed to
have a place like this.

34:55.016 --> 34:57.316
Let me ask you a question.

34:57.493 --> 34:59.926
What do you know about
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma?

35:00.062 --> 35:01.267
Blood cancer.

35:01.292 --> 35:04.040
Body produces a lot of
abnormal lymphocytes.

35:04.065 --> 35:06.098
How'd you like to give it a shot?

35:20.394 --> 35:22.087
The room is clear.

35:22.846 --> 35:25.322
- Clear?
- For lack of a better word.

35:25.767 --> 35:27.099
All right, now.

35:27.124 --> 35:30.525
Everybody, you heard the man.
The room is good now.

35:30.716 --> 35:32.082
I'm sending patients up.

35:32.107 --> 35:32.914
No argument.

35:32.939 --> 35:33.938
Okay.

35:33.963 --> 35:35.295
Mahalo.

35:35.320 --> 35:36.853
Mahalo nui.

35:37.959 --> 35:40.130
Come on,
you don't actually think that there was

35:40.155 --> 35:42.155
anything wrong with the room, right?

35:42.180 --> 35:43.755
Yeah. It's just physics.

35:43.780 --> 35:45.726
Physics?

35:46.035 --> 35:48.437
Vibrations from sound waves.

35:48.462 --> 35:50.629
They create micro movements in things.

35:50.654 --> 35:52.493
They imprint themselves.

35:52.519 --> 35:55.530
So, stuff in a room...
Tables, chairs, walls...

35:55.570 --> 35:59.280
They get changed very slightly,
but they get changed.

35:59.630 --> 36:01.630
A lot of grief and anger in there...

36:01.655 --> 36:03.121
Left its mark.

36:03.146 --> 36:05.027
Not helpful to the ill.

36:05.807 --> 36:07.642
So how do you fix that?

36:07.667 --> 36:09.531
You can't erase things,

36:09.556 --> 36:12.327
but you can write over them.

36:32.349 --> 36:34.383
Big first step.

36:35.546 --> 36:37.546
Remember, it's just the beginning.

36:40.530 --> 36:42.617
What do you want to do with this?

36:43.808 --> 36:45.693
I'll take it.

37:31.350 --> 37:34.313
Hey, I just checked in on Mr. Logan,
he's doing fine.

37:34.338 --> 37:35.702
He said to say thank you,

37:35.727 --> 37:37.825
and he would like to know
when he's going home.

37:42.687 --> 37:45.247
That was a tough diagnosis you made.

37:46.358 --> 37:49.083
How could you be so sure?

37:49.967 --> 37:51.766
When I was a fourth
year, I did a rotation

37:51.791 --> 37:54.789
with this amazing surgeon...
Real old-school.

37:55.472 --> 37:57.776
Unbelievable diagnostician.

37:57.801 --> 37:59.391
Didn't need a scan.

37:59.730 --> 38:01.015
She had such...

38:01.040 --> 38:02.671
Great hands.

38:02.997 --> 38:04.911
Just by touch she could
tell if a patient had

38:04.936 --> 38:07.512
cystic fibrosis, renal cysts.

38:09.110 --> 38:11.082
They don't make 'em like that anymore.

38:11.218 --> 38:13.250
I think I know one.

38:15.084 --> 38:17.203
You know, it's a good thing I
didn't know what I didn't know

38:17.228 --> 38:19.755
before I became a doctor.
I don't think that I would've.

38:19.779 --> 38:21.058
Who would?

38:23.332 --> 38:25.966
- Good night.
- Good night, Will.

38:31.440 --> 38:33.980
Hey, looking good.

38:41.072 --> 38:42.855
Hello, Dr. Rowan.

38:42.880 --> 38:44.633
Hello.

38:45.720 --> 38:47.665
Here you go.

38:57.971 --> 38:59.470
How are you today?

38:59.495 --> 39:02.115
Fit as a fiddle.

39:02.522 --> 39:05.206
Mom said we're going to take a train.

39:05.231 --> 39:06.714
Perfect.

39:07.075 --> 39:09.075
I love trains.

39:10.992 --> 39:13.488
You know, Dr. Rowan,

39:13.887 --> 39:16.333
you were my teacher.

39:17.622 --> 39:19.553
Was I?

39:19.598 --> 39:21.301
That's right.

39:21.326 --> 39:22.918
You were a surgeon.

39:23.879 --> 39:25.479
The best.

39:26.768 --> 39:29.646
How about that?

39:30.095 --> 39:31.485
Yeah.

39:32.193 --> 39:34.460
And I wanted to tell you,

39:34.890 --> 39:37.156
today, what you taught me

39:37.181 --> 39:38.658
saved a man's life.

39:42.118 --> 39:43.584
Thank you.

39:43.609 --> 39:45.582
You're welcome.
