WEBVTT

01:45.146 --> 01:48.190
Audrey, you're a high-school girl.

01:48.358 --> 01:50.359
I'm an agent of the FBI.

01:51.361 --> 01:54.196
So do you want me to leave or what?

01:56.741 --> 02:01.495
What I want and what I need
are two different things, Audrey.

02:02.914 --> 02:04.373
When a man joins the bureau,

02:04.541 --> 02:07.835
he takes an oath
to uphold certain values.

02:08.002 --> 02:10.170
Values that he's sworn to live by.

02:12.674 --> 02:15.175
This is wrong, Audrey.
We both know it.

02:18.638 --> 02:20.472
But don't you like me?

02:20.640 --> 02:23.142
I like you very much.

02:23.560 --> 02:26.645
You're beautiful,
intelligent, desirable.

02:26.813 --> 02:29.690
You're everything that a man wants
in his life.

02:29.858 --> 02:33.694
But what you need right now,
more than anything else, is a friend.

02:33.862 --> 02:35.946
Someone who will listen.

02:52.088 --> 02:53.839
Friends, huh?

02:58.303 --> 03:01.805
Now, I'm gonna go down and get us
two malts and some fries downstairs.

03:01.973 --> 03:04.057
Then I want you to tell me
all your troubles.

03:04.225 --> 03:05.767
I could take all night.

03:07.228 --> 03:09.396
The night is young.

03:10.773 --> 03:14.943
Now, I'm gonna get the food,
and you're gonna get dressed.

03:16.070 --> 03:17.988
I can't tell you all my secrets.

03:18.990 --> 03:20.657
Secrets are dangerous things,
Audrey.

03:21.451 --> 03:24.369
- Do you have any?
- No.

03:24.537 --> 03:26.580
Laura had a lot of secrets.

03:27.999 --> 03:31.168
Finding those out is my job.

03:58.738 --> 04:00.948
Good morning, Officer Brennan.

04:01.950 --> 04:05.661
I sure wish you would stop
calling me Officer Brennan.

04:06.162 --> 04:11.667
Officer Andy, this is peak-activity time
at the station switchboard.

04:11.834 --> 04:14.753
So it's really not convenient for me
to talk right now.

04:17.423 --> 04:20.634
Twin Peaks Sheriff's Station,
may I help you?

04:21.219 --> 04:23.303
One moment, please.

04:31.521 --> 04:33.397
Dr. Stanicek?

04:33.564 --> 04:35.190
Yes, it's me.

04:35.358 --> 04:37.567
Good. I've got the tests...

04:39.988 --> 04:41.446
Oh.

04:43.866 --> 04:45.367
Uh-huh.

04:48.288 --> 04:53.166
Well, thank you, doctor.

04:54.460 --> 04:56.670
No, I'm fine.

04:57.505 --> 04:59.256
Bye.

05:07.098 --> 05:10.017
Morning, Lucy.
Heard you were out sick yesterday.

05:10.184 --> 05:12.936
I'm much better today, thanks.

05:14.522 --> 05:16.523
- We're on it.
- I found it, yeah.

05:16.691 --> 05:20.485
"Gracula Religiosa,

05:20.653 --> 05:23.739
commonly known as the hill myna.

05:23.906 --> 05:27.659
Native to Southeast Asia, Indonesia.

05:27.827 --> 05:32.122
Feeds on fruit mainly,
some invertebrates.

05:32.290 --> 05:35.584
Its ability to mimic the human voice
is amazing."

05:35.752 --> 05:38.253
Yeah, well, so far,
we haven't heard a peep.

05:38.421 --> 05:40.630
Hey, Waldo, what's up?

05:40.798 --> 05:46.094
Well, it says here that "mimicry
is a kind of play with the myna."

05:47.055 --> 05:52.142
But this one's in a weakened condition.
Starved, dehydrated.

05:52.643 --> 05:55.062
I'd say he's feeling anything
but playful.

05:56.189 --> 05:58.607
Here you go, little fella.

05:58.775 --> 06:01.318
Oh, you wanna feed him,
Agent Cooper?

06:01.486 --> 06:03.362
I don't like birds.

06:03.529 --> 06:06.073
When do you think
he'll start talking again?

06:06.240 --> 06:10.911
Well, according to the book,
his urge to mimic should return

06:11.079 --> 06:12.412
with his good health.

06:12.580 --> 06:14.706
Well, if it does,
then we've got a witness.

06:15.124 --> 06:18.377
Well, we better keep feeding him.

06:19.170 --> 06:20.253
You got any apples?

06:20.421 --> 06:22.756
Yeah, there's some
in the bottom of the fridge.

06:22.924 --> 06:24.841
These grapes are right on the edge.

06:25.009 --> 06:27.844
These just came in from your office.

06:29.847 --> 06:31.807
Ah, forensics confirm
Mr. Jacques Renault

06:31.974 --> 06:33.850
had three guests to his cabin.

06:34.018 --> 06:37.145
Laura Palmer, Ronette Pulaski
and Leo Johnson.

06:39.690 --> 06:42.275
That was the only exposed negative
on that roll of film, Harry.

06:42.443 --> 06:44.152
Look familiar?

06:44.904 --> 06:46.446
That's our Waldo.

06:46.781 --> 06:49.491
No, Harry, the girl. That's Laura.

06:52.328 --> 06:55.288
Well, now we know who and when.

06:55.456 --> 06:57.457
We don't know why.

06:59.794 --> 07:01.878
Voice activated, Harry.

07:02.505 --> 07:06.967
When the bird talks,
maybe we'll get some answers.

07:09.303 --> 07:11.304
Albert confirmed that this matches
the fragment

07:11.472 --> 07:13.140
found in Laura's stomach.

07:13.307 --> 07:15.350
Thousand-dollar chip
from One-Eyed Jack's.

07:15.518 --> 07:18.186
Jacques Renault's working there.
He's dealing in the casino.

07:18.354 --> 07:20.856
Well, I think a little fieldwork
is in order.

07:21.023 --> 07:23.400
Jack's is over the border,
little out of our jurisdiction.

07:23.568 --> 07:25.402
Well, I know that, Harry.

07:25.570 --> 07:30.198
That's why I was thinking this would be
a good job for the Bookhouse Boys.

07:48.009 --> 07:49.843
Better call Hawk on that one.

07:53.055 --> 07:54.973
Shelly.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.562
Bobby Briggs.

08:08.863 --> 08:11.698
Come on, lover boy. Leo's waiting.

08:13.784 --> 08:16.578
I called you, but your dad answered.
I didn't know what to say.

08:16.746 --> 08:19.539
Bobby's here, baby. Bobby's here.

08:26.130 --> 08:28.548
I shot him, Bobby.

08:28.925 --> 08:31.134
I know I did.

08:32.887 --> 08:37.098
He just screamed and screamed.
He sounded like an animal.

08:37.892 --> 08:39.434
You what?

08:39.602 --> 08:43.063
Oh, slow down, Shelly. Talk to me.

08:43.231 --> 08:45.398
He's out there, I know he is.

08:45.566 --> 08:47.025
He's gonna kill me.

08:47.193 --> 08:50.820
- Bobby, he's gonna kill me.
- Shelly, Shelly.

08:52.031 --> 08:55.742
Start over. Go real slow.

08:59.872 --> 09:02.624
Leo came home late last night.

09:02.792 --> 09:05.919
He was all beaten up.
He had blood all over him.

09:06.462 --> 09:11.883
I told him I was never ever
gonna let him hurt me again.

09:12.051 --> 09:16.888
But he came at me,
so I pulled the trigger.

09:19.767 --> 09:22.269
I shot him, Bobby.

09:22.770 --> 09:26.565
What am I gonna do?
Where am I gonna hide?

09:26.732 --> 09:32.112
Shelly, Leo Johnson is history,
understand?

09:32.280 --> 09:35.574
I'm taking care of you from now on.

09:35.992 --> 09:39.160
I'm gonna deal with Leo.
I'm gonna deal with James.

09:39.328 --> 09:40.912
Bobby's gonna deal with everything.

09:53.843 --> 09:56.428
Birdseed? No, this bird eats fruit.

09:57.138 --> 09:59.389
The sheriff says it's a witness.

09:59.557 --> 10:02.225
No, not just because
it saw something, because it talks.

10:03.060 --> 10:04.811
And it needs to eat...

10:29.170 --> 10:32.213
What's up, doc? Heh.

10:32.381 --> 10:35.925
Just a few words
before I go to sleep.

10:37.053 --> 10:40.388
I feel like I'm gonna dream tonight.

10:40.848 --> 10:43.683
Big bad ones, you know?

10:44.852 --> 10:47.187
The kind you like.

10:51.692 --> 10:54.819
It's easier talking into the recorder.

10:55.738 --> 10:59.282
I guess I feel I can say anything.

10:59.450 --> 11:02.160
All my secrets.

11:02.703 --> 11:04.829
The naked ones.

11:04.997 --> 11:07.874
I know you like those, doc.

11:08.042 --> 11:11.002
I know you like me too.

11:11.545 --> 11:14.714
That will be my little secret, okay?

11:14.882 --> 11:17.676
Just like your coconut.

11:19.970 --> 11:24.307
Why is it so easy
to make men like me?

11:24.475 --> 11:27.894
And I don't even have to try
very hard.

11:28.270 --> 11:33.858
Or maybe, if it was harder...

11:37.029 --> 11:39.197
This one's empty.

11:41.742 --> 11:44.953
"February 23rd."
The night Laura died.

11:49.417 --> 11:52.711
- Tape's not in there.
- He must still have it.

11:53.254 --> 11:55.213
I mean, she died.
He never returned it.

11:55.381 --> 11:58.299
God, do you think Dr. Jacoby
killed her?

11:59.635 --> 12:02.721
We're gonna find that tape tonight.

12:03.264 --> 12:04.681
Where?

12:04.849 --> 12:07.100
Jacoby's office.

12:07.268 --> 12:09.227
What if he's there?

12:09.395 --> 12:11.396
We'll get him out.

12:12.815 --> 12:14.357
How?

12:15.526 --> 12:19.654
Maybe he gets a phone call
from Laura.

12:25.536 --> 12:27.787
What's up, doc?

12:28.789 --> 12:32.208
Just a few words
before I go to sleep.

12:33.419 --> 12:35.211
I feel like I'm gonna dream tonight.

12:42.261 --> 12:46.181
Here, try this. It smells like a florist.

12:47.099 --> 12:50.977
This won't do.
I want something more fruity.

12:51.145 --> 12:52.353
Fruity.

12:52.521 --> 12:54.314
- As in fruit.
- Jenny.

12:54.482 --> 12:57.066
Could I see you in my office
in five minutes?

12:57.234 --> 12:59.110
Sure. Yeah.

12:59.278 --> 13:00.862
I'm not making myself clear.

13:01.030 --> 13:03.198
I want a scent
that makes a statement.

13:03.365 --> 13:06.659
Maybe you should try hanging it
around your neck.

13:06.827 --> 13:09.370
It's a perfume,
it's a fashion accessory.

13:09.538 --> 13:11.956
Two statements for the price of one.

13:12.124 --> 13:15.084
I don't appreciate your attitude.

13:16.837 --> 13:20.507
Well, thank you for shopping
Horne's Department Store.

13:29.183 --> 13:30.683
I'm gonna use the little girls' room.

13:30.851 --> 13:32.435
Okay.

13:42.446 --> 13:44.239
You know,
there's a real bad accident outside.

13:44.406 --> 13:47.200
It sounded like a bus or something.

14:05.928 --> 14:08.054
Come right this way, Jenny.

14:11.892 --> 14:15.854
Something really special
to talk about today.

14:17.064 --> 14:19.732
Come right in.
My, my, you look lovely.

14:19.900 --> 14:21.401
Sit, sit.

14:21.569 --> 14:23.695
Thank you, Mr. Battis.

14:23.863 --> 14:26.406
This is for you, Jenny.

14:26.574 --> 14:29.742
A reward for a job well done.

14:44.008 --> 14:47.886
It's a unicorn,
ancient symbol of purity.

14:48.053 --> 14:50.930
Tamed only by the young at heart.

14:51.432 --> 14:54.100
Wow, a unicorn.

14:54.894 --> 14:57.562
Jenny, you had a good time
at the club last week, didn't you?

14:57.730 --> 15:01.107
Yeah, yeah,
I had a great time, Mr. Battis.

15:01.275 --> 15:04.444
They were very pleased with you
as well, I must say.

15:04.612 --> 15:06.195
They'd like you to continue.

15:06.363 --> 15:09.032
And believe me, Jenny,
not many girls qualify.

15:09.199 --> 15:11.910
- Really?
- Yes.

15:12.077 --> 15:15.330
Now, the variety of work
is completely up to you.

15:15.497 --> 15:18.458
Hostess, cocktail waitress.

15:18.626 --> 15:23.755
Or if you are chosen, hospitality girl.

15:24.548 --> 15:26.299
What's that?

15:28.218 --> 15:35.224
Hospitality girls
escort important guests, VIPs.

15:36.185 --> 15:38.478
It's a lucrative opportunity, Jenny.

15:38.646 --> 15:43.149
Attending to wealthy men
in need of a little company.

15:43.317 --> 15:46.361
That sounds cool,
as long as they're wealthy.

15:46.695 --> 15:52.367
Jenny, your attitude
will take you far in this life.

15:52.534 --> 15:56.204
Call this number,
ask for Black Rose.

15:56.580 --> 15:58.247
Now why don't we make a trip
to Eveningwear

15:58.415 --> 16:00.333
and find you something elegant?

16:00.501 --> 16:02.669
Elegant sounds great, Mr. Battis.

16:02.836 --> 16:04.420
Elegant.

16:04.588 --> 16:06.881
How do you feel about rose?

16:25.234 --> 16:27.402
"Ronette Pulaski."

16:42.918 --> 16:45.128
You're in prison,
you remember faces from home.

16:45.295 --> 16:48.047
They all seem like friends somehow,
even the ones you barely knew.

16:48.215 --> 16:50.842
It's like something to hang on to,
I guess.

16:51.010 --> 16:53.469
Must have been hard on you.

16:53.637 --> 16:55.972
I paid my debt. That's what counts.

16:56.140 --> 16:58.558
You know, you're a really big help
around here.

16:58.726 --> 17:02.478
I wanna thank you for that,
for getting Norma through.

17:02.646 --> 17:04.981
You're welcome, Hank.
It's no problem.

17:05.149 --> 17:07.734
She told me in her letters
how much you've meant,

17:07.901 --> 17:09.861
and how much Pete helped...

17:10.029 --> 17:11.320
Pete?

17:11.488 --> 17:13.573
Yeah, no, not Pete. Um...

17:13.741 --> 17:14.907
Oh, no, you mean Ed.

17:15.075 --> 17:17.243
- Yeah, Big Ed.
- Yeah.

17:17.411 --> 17:18.745
Yeah, I'm a little better at faces

17:18.912 --> 17:20.038
- than names, I guess.
- Oh.

17:25.335 --> 17:28.880
Yeah, Big Ed.

17:29.923 --> 17:31.632
Hello there.

17:40.434 --> 17:43.102
Shelly, can we have another cup here?

17:45.272 --> 17:46.981
Hello, Hank.

17:47.149 --> 17:49.942
Hi, Harry. Glad to see me?

17:51.028 --> 17:53.237
You, uh...
You looking for a free lunch,

17:55.157 --> 17:56.824
I recommend the meatloaf.

17:56.992 --> 17:59.160
Well, save it. I'm looking for you.

17:59.328 --> 18:02.789
- Harry, I'm innocent.
- What you are is on parole, Hank.

18:03.332 --> 18:07.168
That means you pay your case officer
a visit once a week, Fridays.

18:07.336 --> 18:10.171
You miss a visit, go to jail. Got it?

18:10.339 --> 18:12.840
Thanks for the reminder, sheriff.

18:13.008 --> 18:15.301
Stop in anytime.

18:17.471 --> 18:20.098
Do you think people really change,
Cooper?

18:20.265 --> 18:21.766
I don't.

18:21.934 --> 18:24.018
Oh, afternoon, guys.

18:24.645 --> 18:27.396
- You like some coffee?
- Afternoon, Shelly. Yes.

18:27.564 --> 18:29.273
We should be on our way.

18:30.400 --> 18:35.446
Harry, I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret.

18:35.614 --> 18:40.660
Every day, once a day,
give yourself a present.

18:40.828 --> 18:46.249
Don't plan it, don't wait for it,
just let it happen.

18:46.625 --> 18:48.292
It could be a new shirt
at the men's store,

18:48.460 --> 18:50.128
a catnap in your office chair,

18:50.295 --> 18:56.467
or two cups of good hot black coffee,
like this.

18:56.635 --> 18:59.595
A present. Like Christmas?

18:59.763 --> 19:01.180
Yeah.

19:08.438 --> 19:12.400
Oh. Man, that hits the spot.

19:15.654 --> 19:18.698
Nothing like a great cup
of black coffee.

19:21.660 --> 19:22.743
Bye, Audrey.

19:22.911 --> 19:24.745
So did Battis get you a dress?

19:24.913 --> 19:26.372
Yeah, he did.

19:26.540 --> 19:28.958
Got mine yesterday. I'm gonna be
working hostess this weekend.

19:29.126 --> 19:30.126
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

19:30.294 --> 19:32.128
- Cool.
- Got one of these too.

19:32.296 --> 19:34.297
Yeah, what am I gonna do
with a horned horse?

19:34.464 --> 19:36.966
Ha, ha. Ditto.
I bet he's got cartons of them.

19:37.134 --> 19:39.552
He probably does.

19:39.720 --> 19:41.429
God, Jenny,
I did a really dumb thing.

19:41.597 --> 19:44.056
Um, I lost that number
that he gave me for Black Rose.

19:44.224 --> 19:45.808
Do you have it?

19:47.436 --> 19:48.603
Yeah, I got it.

19:48.770 --> 19:50.354
Great.

19:54.151 --> 19:55.735
Here.

19:59.239 --> 20:00.698
Thanks.

20:00.866 --> 20:04.285
- Okay, I'll talk to you later.
- Okay, see you tomorrow.

20:17.758 --> 20:19.425
I wasn't fooling, Montana.

20:20.260 --> 20:22.470
You show them, Chet.

20:23.096 --> 20:25.765
You show all of them.

20:31.772 --> 20:36.484
Tune in tomorrow for Invitation To Love.

20:41.365 --> 20:42.823
Ed.

20:44.409 --> 20:46.827
I'm eating bonbons.

20:53.001 --> 20:55.211
Come on, honey, it's not that bad.

20:55.504 --> 20:57.964
You don't know how bad it is.

20:58.882 --> 21:03.261
You don't know all the things
I was gonna do for us.

21:03.428 --> 21:05.179
I know.

21:05.722 --> 21:08.849
A new TV, I was gonna do that.

21:09.601 --> 21:11.185
I already looked at a motorboat.

21:11.353 --> 21:13.145
Sweetheart.

21:14.940 --> 21:17.733
It wasn't just things I was gonna buy.

21:17.901 --> 21:21.070
It was a new life
we were gonna lead.

21:21.238 --> 21:23.990
Nadine,
there's plenty of patent attorneys.

21:24.157 --> 21:25.992
We just got to keep on looking
till we find one

21:26.159 --> 21:27.952
that understands drape runners.

21:28.120 --> 21:30.329
Rejected.

21:30.497 --> 21:33.499
Rejected. That's what he said.

21:33.667 --> 21:36.085
Nobody else
is gonna say anything different.

21:36.336 --> 21:40.381
Nadine, don't you give up.
Don't you dare.

21:46.680 --> 21:51.851
I just got that baby back
from Tim and Tom's Taxidermy.

21:54.438 --> 21:57.857
When I caught him, he was this big.

21:58.358 --> 22:03.529
But I guess by the time they take
the innards out and put the stuffing in,

22:03.697 --> 22:06.741
it loses something in the translation.

22:06.908 --> 22:09.493
Yeah, well, Pete,
it's still a fine-looking trophy,

22:09.661 --> 22:11.871
no matter what the size.

22:12.414 --> 22:17.251
Yeah, well, size isn't everything,
I guess.

22:17.711 --> 22:22.048
Harry. I didn't expect you to be here.

22:23.216 --> 22:27.386
I'm late for the mill,
but I'll make time for us.

22:28.764 --> 22:29.764
What's wrong?

22:29.931 --> 22:33.225
What were you doing
at the Timber Falls Motel, Tuesday?

22:33.393 --> 22:34.769
Oh.

22:35.228 --> 22:37.146
Tuesday I was at the mill.

22:37.314 --> 22:40.900
Hawk saw you.
I know you were there.

22:41.943 --> 22:43.319
Oh.

22:44.196 --> 22:46.364
Harry.

22:47.741 --> 22:49.325
You can tell me anything.

22:49.493 --> 22:52.161
Josie, you can tell me anything.

22:53.038 --> 22:54.955
I was there

22:56.666 --> 22:59.377
because Ben and Catherine
were there together.

22:59.544 --> 23:04.090
I followed them and I took pictures.

23:16.728 --> 23:18.813
What's this all about?

23:18.980 --> 23:22.691
You asked me for proof last time.

23:22.859 --> 23:26.612
And I followed them
and I took pictures.

23:28.949 --> 23:33.244
The other night I heard
Catherine talking on the phone.

23:33.412 --> 23:36.539
Something about an accident.

23:36.706 --> 23:40.793
A fire. A fire at the mill.

23:42.629 --> 23:45.172
A fire at Andrew's mill.

23:45.507 --> 23:47.133
My mill.

23:49.594 --> 23:53.722
I'm not gonna let this happen. No.

23:57.352 --> 23:59.478
Neither will I.

23:59.646 --> 24:01.522
I won't let it happen.

24:18.331 --> 24:20.458
Well, now.

24:20.625 --> 24:23.711
Evening, Harry, Ed. You all set?

24:24.379 --> 24:27.214
- Is that what you're wearing?
- It's pretty spiffy, Cooper.

24:27.382 --> 24:29.216
Do you like to gamble, Ed?

24:30.177 --> 24:33.012
Well, I went to Reno once.
But I never felt too lucky.

24:33.180 --> 24:35.139
Well, you're gonna be lucky tonight.

24:38.018 --> 24:41.020
It's $10,000 of the bureau's money.

24:42.731 --> 24:44.190
When I gamble
with a company stake,

24:44.357 --> 24:46.525
I always like to bring back
a 10 to 15 percent return.

24:46.693 --> 24:48.611
How much you wanna start with?

24:48.820 --> 24:51.363
How about 300?

24:52.449 --> 24:54.992
And, Ed, the suit is perfect.

24:56.495 --> 24:59.079
Well,
Harry would like to talk with you.

24:59.372 --> 25:02.124
So why don't I see you outside?

25:04.628 --> 25:07.129
Yeah, Harry, what's on your mind?

25:08.256 --> 25:11.550
I'm worried about Josie.
She's been real afraid.

25:11.718 --> 25:13.093
About what?

25:13.261 --> 25:15.262
Ben Horne and Catherine Martell.

25:15.680 --> 25:17.515
Now, they've been seeing
each other on the side.

25:17.682 --> 25:20.518
It's been going on for years.
Josie just found out.

25:21.269 --> 25:24.355
She thinks that they're planning
to burn down the sawmill

25:24.523 --> 25:27.900
and somehow get rid of her too.

25:28.068 --> 25:29.818
Do you believe her?

25:29.986 --> 25:33.197
I know Ben Horne wants that land
for the Ghostwood Development,

25:33.365 --> 25:36.909
and I know Josie won't sell.
Yeah, yeah, I believe her.

25:37.077 --> 25:38.994
How much do you know about her?

25:39.162 --> 25:41.956
Where she's from?
Who she was before?

25:42.457 --> 25:44.583
- What you getting at?
- The truth, Harry.

25:44.751 --> 25:46.794
- That's my job.
- I know all I need to know.

25:46.962 --> 25:49.088
I love her, and she's in trouble.

25:50.507 --> 25:53.717
That's good enough for me.
Let's look into it.

25:54.594 --> 25:56.011
Thanks.

25:56.638 --> 25:59.390
- Is Hawk ready?
- Yeah, he's outside in the van.

26:00.725 --> 26:01.934
Oh.

26:02.102 --> 26:03.936
I got that brand-new Cadillac
you wanted.

26:04.104 --> 26:06.063
Good. It's perfect for our cover.

26:06.231 --> 26:08.107
High rollers from the Tri-Cities.

26:08.275 --> 26:10.442
Oral surgeons, Harry.

26:10.610 --> 26:14.321
Big spenders
vacationing among the firs.

26:29.462 --> 26:32.381
Yeah,
has Agent Cooper returned yet?

26:32.841 --> 26:37.094
I need to leave another message.
Tell him that Audrey called again.

26:37.554 --> 26:39.930
Yes, it's still urgent.

26:43.852 --> 26:46.061
I'm glad you agreed to see me,
Mrs. Martell.

26:46.229 --> 26:47.229
It's quite all right.

26:47.397 --> 26:49.440
Normally,
I'd never think to impose this late.

26:49.608 --> 26:51.775
That's fine. Now what's this about?

26:51.943 --> 26:54.361
Every agent is instructed
five signatures.

26:54.529 --> 26:58.699
It's really the first thing we learn,
and somehow we missed one.

26:58.867 --> 27:01.910
Now, refresh my memory.
What policy is this?

27:02.078 --> 27:03.746
Your new life insurance.

27:03.913 --> 27:05.873
Since the binder takes effect
at midnight tonight,

27:06.041 --> 27:09.043
I really had no choice, see.
Just couldn't wait until tomorrow.

27:10.837 --> 27:12.838
Right here, please.

27:18.178 --> 27:19.970
Is everything in order, Mrs. Martell?

27:22.182 --> 27:23.891
Yes. It's just...

27:28.605 --> 27:31.273
This was handled without
our actually meeting each other.

27:31.441 --> 27:33.651
And I... I'd almost forgotten.

27:34.653 --> 27:36.445
To be perfectly honest with you,
Mrs. Martell,

27:36.613 --> 27:38.781
I withheld that last page myself.

27:39.240 --> 27:40.240
Did you?

27:40.408 --> 27:43.661
Have to admit
I thought it a little unusual.

27:43.828 --> 27:47.539
Life insurance and the client
is too busy to be involved?

27:47.707 --> 27:51.126
I mean, you did know about this policy,
didn't you?

27:51.711 --> 27:52.711
Are you suggesting

27:52.879 --> 27:56.548
that there's something irregular
at work here?

27:56.716 --> 27:59.134
I certainly never got that idea
from Mrs. Packard, no.

27:59.302 --> 28:01.428
Or from Mr. Horne,
for that matter, either.

28:01.721 --> 28:04.390
When he offered to collect
your signatures, I thought it was fine.

28:04.557 --> 28:10.896
Just, with a new account
I like to be certain to cross every T.

28:11.064 --> 28:12.606
Right here, please.

28:13.525 --> 28:18.904
You know, I'm noticing
that there are some minor changes

28:19.072 --> 28:23.826
that I asked my attorney to make
that are not included in this draft.

28:23.993 --> 28:25.411
I think what I'd like to do

28:25.578 --> 28:27.663
is go over this with him
on the phone in the morning

28:27.831 --> 28:30.416
and initial the changes

28:30.583 --> 28:33.585
and get the completed documents
to you at that time.

28:33.753 --> 28:39.717
If there's anything that I can do
to help you with the policy

28:39.884 --> 28:43.512
or anything at all, anything.

28:43.930 --> 28:47.015
Are you an ambitious man,
Mr. Neff?

28:47.934 --> 28:49.435
One likes to think so.

28:49.811 --> 28:51.645
One never knows.

28:51.813 --> 28:55.441
There may be a few T's left to cross.

28:56.484 --> 28:57.985
Good night.

28:58.153 --> 29:00.070
Mrs. Martell.

29:02.157 --> 29:04.450
I'll see myself out.

29:15.420 --> 29:20.382
Think.

29:58.296 --> 29:59.838
Ed, why don't you open that up?

30:01.674 --> 30:04.468
Wow, look at all this.

30:05.053 --> 30:06.386
Ow.

30:06.554 --> 30:08.222
I'm sorry.

30:09.224 --> 30:14.061
There's a curly-haired wig in there, Ed.
It's gonna work like gangbusters.

30:14.229 --> 30:17.231
And I'll help you out
with one of those mustaches.

30:17.398 --> 30:19.691
Do you think it will fit?
I got a big head.

30:19.859 --> 30:22.027
Okay, give it a try.

30:23.321 --> 30:24.655
Testing, one, two.

30:39.420 --> 30:43.549
Laura, Laura.

31:25.425 --> 31:29.219
- What happened?
- Somebody shot Waldo.

31:29.387 --> 31:31.597
Aw, Jesus.

31:33.433 --> 31:35.434
Poor Waldo.

31:40.982 --> 31:42.316
What happened?

31:42.483 --> 31:44.151
Somebody shot Waldo.

31:48.364 --> 31:50.032
Birdy, birdy, birdy.

31:50.199 --> 31:53.243
Want some orange? Come on.
Let's share.

31:57.498 --> 31:59.249
Hello, Waldo.

32:04.797 --> 32:08.842
Laura, Laura.

32:09.010 --> 32:11.178
Don't go there.

32:15.975 --> 32:19.603
Hurting me. Hurting me.

32:20.605 --> 32:23.982
Stop it. Stop it.

32:26.486 --> 32:28.111
Stop it.

32:29.822 --> 32:34.493
Leo, no. Leo, no.

32:55.515 --> 32:57.265
Casino's probably in the back.

32:57.433 --> 32:59.851
If Jacques' dealing,
that's where we'll find him.

33:00.019 --> 33:02.229
Well, I'll give you the high sign
and clear out.

33:05.483 --> 33:06.858
Here comes something.

33:07.151 --> 33:10.112
Evening, fellas.
They call me Blackie.

33:10.405 --> 33:13.532
Glad to know you, Blackie.
I like your style.

33:13.700 --> 33:15.993
Most do. First time here?

33:16.160 --> 33:17.869
Yeah, it's our rookie season.

33:18.037 --> 33:20.622
Well, you just think
of tonight as spring training.

33:20.790 --> 33:23.750
With a little luck,
you just might make the team.

33:24.711 --> 33:28.380
- You look like a cop.
- I'm the cop.

33:30.341 --> 33:34.011
You look like Cary Grant.
Got a name?

33:34.178 --> 33:37.639
Barney and Fred.
Just in from the Tri-Cities.

33:37.807 --> 33:40.434
Well, Fred, what's your line?

33:40.601 --> 33:42.269
Own a gas station.

33:43.062 --> 33:45.731
Um, I'm an oral surgeon.

33:46.482 --> 33:50.736
Well, I got a Chevy parked out back
with a serious root-canal problem.

33:51.070 --> 33:52.487
Want to take a look?

33:52.655 --> 33:54.740
Well, I was hoping you might need
a little gum work,

33:54.907 --> 33:57.367
because I'd sure like to get
a look under your hood.

33:57.577 --> 33:59.661
Mm, Fred's okay.

33:59.829 --> 34:01.580
Fred's a prince.

34:01.748 --> 34:03.582
So, boys, what's your pleasure?

34:03.750 --> 34:07.252
- Cards and dice.
- For starters.

34:07.462 --> 34:09.337
Casino's that way.

34:09.505 --> 34:12.966
- This might just be your lucky night.
- Luck has nothing to do with it.

34:15.261 --> 34:18.597
Not bad, Ed. Not bad at all.

34:28.775 --> 34:30.692
Hawk, we have a small casino room

34:30.860 --> 34:33.862
with the usual games of chance.

34:34.030 --> 34:37.115
Bar's at the far end and
there's stairs to who knows where.

34:37.283 --> 34:39.534
Everybody's having a good time.

34:39.702 --> 34:42.120
No sign of Jacques Renault.

34:42.288 --> 34:44.414
Ed's gonna head over
to the craps table.

34:44.582 --> 34:46.583
I'm gonna play some blackjack.

34:47.001 --> 34:48.460
Ed,

34:48.628 --> 34:50.462
let's gamble.

36:31.147 --> 36:35.525
You simply have got to teach me
some of these incredible songs.

36:35.902 --> 36:36.902
Incredible, eh?

36:37.069 --> 36:38.069
Incredible.

36:38.237 --> 36:40.238
Jerry, maybe you'd like to take
some of our guests

36:40.406 --> 36:41.781
down to the dining room.

36:45.786 --> 36:48.538
I'll be with you in a half a tick.

36:52.001 --> 36:54.628
You should have seen them
at this tour of the site.

36:54.795 --> 36:56.087
- The trees, Ben.
- Jerry.

36:56.255 --> 36:57.881
- They worship them.
- Jerry.

36:58.049 --> 36:59.925
I caught a couple of them
hugging pine.

37:00.092 --> 37:01.092
- Jerry.
- No kidding.

37:01.260 --> 37:03.637
When are they
signing the contracts?

37:03.804 --> 37:06.264
This needs more pecan.
They're ready, Ben.

37:06.432 --> 37:08.141
They're poised
with their pen in their hand.

37:08.309 --> 37:09.809
Mm-hm.

37:09.977 --> 37:11.144
Yeah?

37:11.312 --> 37:14.147
- So, what's the catch?
- More fun.

37:14.315 --> 37:15.440
Signing party.

37:15.608 --> 37:18.068
They want to finalize the deal
at One-Eyed Jack's.

37:20.780 --> 37:22.697
How did they find out about Jack's?

37:25.785 --> 37:27.744
I take full responsibility.

37:27.954 --> 37:30.538
Uh-huh. Jerry, Jerry.

37:31.249 --> 37:33.208
Get them back on the van.

37:36.504 --> 37:40.632
Heh. Okay, everybody,
back in the van!

37:41.300 --> 37:43.510
Road trip! Road trip!

37:43.678 --> 37:45.679
- Hey, going on a road trip.
- Road trip.

37:45.846 --> 37:47.180
- Road trip.
- Road trip.

37:47.348 --> 37:49.140
Road trip.

37:57.066 --> 37:58.400
- Ahem.
- Hello.

37:58.567 --> 38:00.277
Is she there?

38:01.404 --> 38:03.697
I just came back. She's gone.

38:04.240 --> 38:06.241
We need her at the mill.

38:06.409 --> 38:07.826
I'll get her there.

38:07.994 --> 38:11.079
- Is it set for tonight?
- Yes.

38:11.414 --> 38:13.999
You shouldn't call here for a while.

38:14.166 --> 38:16.543
I know the drill.

38:44.530 --> 38:46.614
You're not a shy one, are you,
sweetheart?

38:47.074 --> 38:48.992
I'm not shy.

39:03.174 --> 39:05.091
Hester Prynne.

39:05.259 --> 39:06.926
Pretty name.

39:07.094 --> 39:09.763
Maple House in Vancouver.

39:09.930 --> 39:12.515
Roy's in Chicago.

39:12.683 --> 39:16.353
Calgary Stampede, '87 through '89.

39:16.520 --> 39:18.855
Where did you work in Calgary,
darling?

39:19.023 --> 39:20.273
Around.

39:20.441 --> 39:22.067
Can you give me a name?

39:23.069 --> 39:25.111
The Lost Dude Ranch.

39:27.823 --> 39:29.574
Big Amos still running things
out there?

39:29.742 --> 39:32.577
Mm. Bigger and better.

39:36.457 --> 39:39.209
Big Amos is the name of my dog.

39:39.585 --> 39:42.170
I read The Scarlet Letter
in high school just like you did.

39:42.797 --> 39:43.797
Give me one good reason

39:43.964 --> 39:47.175
why I shouldn't airmail
your bottom back to civilization.

40:37.768 --> 40:39.602
Sign here.

40:40.187 --> 40:42.105
Welcome to One-Eyed Jack's,
Hester.

40:48.863 --> 40:50.655
Twenty-one again. Another winner.

40:52.950 --> 40:55.827
- How did you do?
- Do I have to pay you back?

40:56.370 --> 40:58.705
We'll take it out of my winnings.

40:58.873 --> 41:01.583
- Care to sit in?
- Blackjack is not my game.

41:01.750 --> 41:04.002
- Ed, can you count to ten?
- On a good night.

41:04.170 --> 41:06.379
Then you can win at blackjack.

41:11.218 --> 41:12.677
Gentlemen, place your bets.

41:15.848 --> 41:19.476
- Jacques, is it?
- That's me.

41:22.062 --> 41:25.023
Jade. Here's to old times.

41:25.691 --> 41:28.109
Should old acquaintance be forgot?

41:34.909 --> 41:37.410
Come on, baby. Bottoms up.

41:37.578 --> 41:39.704
One for the road.
For old times' sake.

41:39.872 --> 41:40.872
Aloha.

41:44.668 --> 41:48.087
Hey, what's up, doc?

41:48.422 --> 41:52.926
Feel like I'm gonna dream tonight.
Big bad ones.

41:53.093 --> 41:54.511
You know?

41:54.720 --> 41:56.137
The kind you like.

41:56.847 --> 41:58.598
Who is this?

41:59.058 --> 42:01.518
Who do you think it is, silly?

42:02.186 --> 42:03.686
I want to see you.

42:04.188 --> 42:07.357
- You're not Laura.
- Okay, doc.

42:08.651 --> 42:12.737
First thing you have to do
is go to the door.

42:14.281 --> 42:15.990
Go on.

42:16.617 --> 42:19.452
There's something waiting for you.

43:09.628 --> 43:13.881
It's today's paper, doc.
Now do you believe me?

43:14.466 --> 43:18.428
Meet me at Sparkwood and 21.

43:18.596 --> 43:20.305
In ten minutes.

43:23.058 --> 43:24.726
But wait...

43:30.733 --> 43:32.400
You think he bought it?

43:34.028 --> 43:35.778
I think so.

43:36.655 --> 43:38.281
I think he did.

43:39.533 --> 43:42.160
Okay. Wait here for us.

44:41.720 --> 44:43.221
Gazebo.

45:42.489 --> 46:57.396
Say goodbye, James.
