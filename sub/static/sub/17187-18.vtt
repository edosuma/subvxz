34:24.980 --> 34:28.232
Please inform the crew. Thank you.

34:35.991 --> 34:37.658
[SIGHS]

34:37.826 --> 34:40.661
JESSE: Just stay sharp. You'll be fine.
-Oh, I know I'll be fine.

34:40.829 --> 34:41.829
[GUN COCKS]

34:41.997 --> 34:43.831
-I got this.
-I'm serious, Dietz.

34:45.041 --> 34:48.461
-I'm always serious about being fine.
-You do me one favor.

34:49.671 --> 34:53.799
You see anything you don't like,
you think before you pull that trigger.

34:54.760 --> 34:57.178
I've been seeing things I don't like
since J-Day.

34:57.345 --> 35:00.639
You don't get to be my age
without thinking first.

35:02.809 --> 35:06.854
I swear, Mom. We'll hold hands
before we cross the street.

35:10.650 --> 35:15.321
ASDS has cut engines, commander.
I think we're clear for comms.

35:15.489 --> 35:17.823
ASDS, this is Carter, over.

35:17.991 --> 35:21.202
DIETZ: Hey, Mom. I'll say this much
about a deep-sea oil rig:

35:21.369 --> 35:24.163
Second-worst thing I've ever smelled.
Dark as night out hete.

35:24.331 --> 35:26.040
We're gonna keep this channel open.

35:26.208 --> 35:29.001
Maintain radio silence
till you've got the package.

35:29.169 --> 35:30.836
Planning on it.

35:31.880 --> 35:33.881
[RAIN PATTERING]

35:34.049 --> 35:36.050
[THUNDER RUMBLING]

37:31.082 --> 37:35.002
Connor sent me. John Connor.

37:36.504 --> 37:38.297
I've come for that.

37:39.007 --> 37:40.215
That's for him.

37:42.135 --> 37:43.469
I'm just here to pick it up.

38:18.254 --> 38:20.255
[METAL CLANKING]

38:25.804 --> 38:27.805
[THUNDER RUMBLING]

38:39.609 --> 38:43.779
I had planned on waiting for you
with Derek's sniper rifle.

38:43.989 --> 38:49.702
Pulled the trigger, solved about
50 percent of my problems. One shot.

38:53.081 --> 38:55.416
Do you know how bad I'd have felt?

38:56.001 --> 38:59.253
-Very bad?
-Not bad at all.

39:00.755 --> 39:03.757
But I know someone
who'd have felt bad.

39:04.551 --> 39:07.052
Someone who would never forgive me
if I'd done that.

39:09.389 --> 39:11.640
I don't know what to do with you.

39:13.018 --> 39:16.020
You know what the stakes are.
You know why we're here.

39:17.397 --> 39:19.565
You know what this means.

39:20.608 --> 39:23.777
And yet here I stand,
burning what's left of an endoskeleton...

39:23.945 --> 39:26.822
-...I thought we'd burned months ago.
-I needed spare parts.

39:27.032 --> 39:30.325
I don't care what you need,
because this is not about you.

39:30.535 --> 39:34.955
No, it's not about me. It's about John.

39:38.460 --> 39:40.502
You're concerned for his safety.

39:40.670 --> 39:43.172
-You bet I am.
-From Skynet.

39:43.923 --> 39:46.633
-From me.
-Maybe.

39:47.677 --> 39:49.636
Maybe especially you.

39:50.638 --> 39:55.142
We're all a threat.
We're all a threat to John.

39:57.312 --> 40:01.648
He worries about us.
That makes him vulnerable.

40:03.109 --> 40:04.651
He cares.

40:05.653 --> 40:08.113
I am not John's problem.

40:08.948 --> 40:13.285
John is John's problem.
Humans are the problem.

40:14.829 --> 40:17.831
There's only one way for him to be safe.

40:17.999 --> 40:19.500
That's to be alone.

40:20.877 --> 40:23.337
What kind of life is that?

40:23.588 --> 40:27.883
John's life, someday.

42:25.251 --> 42:27.252
I'm sorry.
