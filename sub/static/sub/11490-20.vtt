00:03.310 --> 00:05.990
Aren't you going to wash
your hands before you eat?

00:06.000 --> 00:09.560
No. I wrap the toilet paper around
my fingers like an oven mitt.

00:10.720 --> 00:13.160
You could catch a puck with it.

00:13.170 --> 00:15.530
So, Mom, what brings you
to our neck of the woods?

00:15.570 --> 00:16.950
I'm showing a house down at the beach.

00:16.980 --> 00:18.930
Thought I'd swing by
and see my grandson.

00:18.950 --> 00:20.980
Tada!

00:25.250 --> 00:26.320
Nice house?

00:26.350 --> 00:29.160
Oh, magnificent. And priced to move.

00:29.170 --> 00:31.890
The owner lost everything in
the stock market, killed himself.

00:31.920 --> 00:32.650
Oh, that's terrible.

00:32.680 --> 00:35.670
Oh, no. He didn't do it
in the house. Thank God.

00:35.680 --> 00:40.350
Even with an ocean view, suicide
homes are a bitch to unload.

00:41.690 --> 00:45.170
Keephat in mind in case you ever
want to teach your brother a lesson.

00:45.680 --> 00:48.000
Thanks for the tip.

00:48.340 --> 00:52.610
Good morning, Alan.
Morning, Jake. Satan.

00:56.100 --> 00:59.390
Good morning, darling. Two coffee cups?

00:59.400 --> 01:01.290
Did you have a friend spend the night?

01:01.320 --> 01:02.540
Yes, I did.

01:02.580 --> 01:05.390
Couldn't get her to stand
on the trapdoor, huh?

01:06.300 --> 01:08.960
Charlie, I don't have
time for coffee, so...

01:10.020 --> 01:12.610
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

01:12.620 --> 01:14.340
Uh, Chelsea, this is my mother.

01:14.360 --> 01:15.900
Mom, this is Chelsea.

01:15.910 --> 01:18.550
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

01:18.560 --> 01:20.890
Welcome back to the States.

01:23.020 --> 01:26.020
Thank you. Where have I been?

01:26.030 --> 01:27.900
Charlie says you have
a place in Italy and...

01:27.920 --> 01:32.680
You know, Chelsea, sometimes when
I'm drunk, I make up stories, so...

01:32.690 --> 01:35.500
You know, grain of salt.

01:35.510 --> 01:38.500
That is quite an engagement ring.

01:38.550 --> 01:39.740
Thank you.

01:39.770 --> 01:42.210
Does your fianc\ know about this one?

01:42.600 --> 01:45.330
My fianc\ is thione.

01:50.570 --> 01:53.280
You want me to put this in a travel mug?

01:53.890 --> 01:55.700
You didn't tell your
mother we're engaged?

01:55.740 --> 01:59.320
If she hadn't sold me the house,
she wouldn't even know where I live.

02:06.870 --> 02:09.570
When were you going to tell
her about me? At the wedding?

02:09.580 --> 02:13.210
Well, technically, I think we
have up to a year after that.

02:13.220 --> 02:15.530
Shame on you. I am so sorry.

02:15.540 --> 02:18.100
It's all right, dear. I'm used to it.

02:18.390 --> 02:21.280
Although a phone call
would have been nice.

02:22.630 --> 02:26.200
It's good to meet you. Excuse me.

02:32.110 --> 02:34.850
So, yea or nay on the travel mug?

02:35.350 --> 02:38.310
Charlie, you just broke
your mother's heart.

02:48.270 --> 02:49.900
How is that funny?

02:49.940 --> 02:52.680
It's not. Guys, a little respect.

02:53.680 --> 02:56.350
What is wrong with you?

02:56.360 --> 02:59.100
Same stuff as always, nothing new.

02:59.110 --> 03:01.640
Does this smell like butt to you?

03:10.640 --> 03:12.680
I'm glad you came over.

03:12.710 --> 03:15.240
That was the plan, wasn't it?

03:15.720 --> 03:18.290
Yeah, but I thought you
might still be angry with me.

03:18.300 --> 03:21.480
I'm not angry, Charlie.
I'm just disappointed.

03:21.830 --> 03:24.580
Gee, I'd kind of prefer
it if you were angry.

03:25.340 --> 03:27.410
Why?

03:27.420 --> 03:29.910
Because angry sex is hot.

03:29.920 --> 03:33.760
Disappointed sex is... well,
we might as well be married.

03:34.480 --> 03:37.340
- Just brush your teeth.
- Brushing.

03:38.140 --> 03:41.490
Look, I understand you have a
difficult relationship with your mom.

03:42.980 --> 03:45.270
But it makes things kind of tough on me.

03:45.300 --> 03:48.080
Hey, I don't expect you
to dislike her right away.

03:48.090 --> 03:50.650
Give it time. Let it happen naturally.

03:52.450 --> 03:54.000
That's not funny.

03:54.020 --> 03:59.230
If I'm going to marry into your family, I want
us to act like a family, care for each other.

03:59.250 --> 04:02.300
With my family, it's kind of either/or.

04:02.310 --> 04:03.760
Let me put it this way.

04:03.790 --> 04:06.410
I'm taking your mother
to lunch on Thursday.

04:10.650 --> 04:12.440
You're doing wha

04:12.450 --> 04:16.560
I'm not going to participate in
this childish little feud of yours.

04:16.570 --> 04:20.410
It's not a childish feud. Boy.

04:21.440 --> 04:22.340
Come on, Charlie.

04:22.370 --> 04:25.760
What's wrong with me having a warm and
healthy relationship with your mother?

04:25.780 --> 04:29.900
Well, for starters,
you'll be the only one.

04:30.110 --> 04:32.470
Ever.

04:32.480 --> 04:34.180
Oh, don't be so dramatic.

04:34.220 --> 04:36.960
No, no, no, no. I'm not
being dramatic enough.

04:36.970 --> 04:40.340
I should be wearing
tights and holding a skull.

04:40.810 --> 04:43.100
Preferably hers.

04:43.140 --> 04:44.290
It's just lunch.

04:44.330 --> 04:47.450
That's what Hitler said Czechoslovakia.

04:47.880 --> 04:50.550
Hitler said, "It's just lunch"?

04:50.560 --> 04:52.730
Well, he said it in German.

04:52.760 --> 04:55.230
Watch the History Channel.

04:55.940 --> 04:58.690
Charlie, I'm not doing this to hurt you.

04:58.720 --> 05:00.970
Did you ever think that by my
spending time with your mother,

05:00.980 --> 05:03.730
I can get a better understanding of you?

05:03.740 --> 05:05.570
Chelsea, trust me.

05:05.590 --> 05:09.830
Any insight you gain into me via my
mother will end our relationship faster

05:09.890 --> 05:12.760
than catching me in
bed with a farm animal.

05:14.400 --> 05:16.900
Just relax. It'll be fine.

05:16.910 --> 05:20.060
That's what Hitler said to Poland.

05:21.860 --> 05:26.380
And for the record, as long as we've been
going out, I've never met your mother.

05:26.410 --> 05:27.970
My mother's in Illinois.

05:27.990 --> 05:30.820
Oh, yeah, and my mother's in "Italy. "

05:31.680 --> 05:34.190
My mother really lives in Illinois.

05:34.220 --> 05:36.230
And besides, when you meet her,

05:36.240 --> 05:39.700
you will count your blessings you
have someone as wonderful as your mom.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.840
Tell you what, I'll trade you.
Sight unseen, my mom for yours.

05:43.850 --> 05:47.200
- Charlie.
- I'll even throw in Alan and a couple of Omaha steaks.

05:48.280 --> 05:49.870
Come here.

05:49.890 --> 05:54.350
No, I don't want to. I'm too upset.

05:55.580 --> 05:58.280
Okay. Good night.

05:58.810 --> 06:02.780
I'm sorry. I can't separate
my emotions from my body.

06:03.100 --> 06:05.740
- I understand.
- I don't want to punish you.

06:05.750 --> 06:10.370
I'm just saying, if my heart's not in it, then
it's just my penis going through the motions.

06:10.860 --> 06:13.180
Well, we certainly wouldn't want that.

06:13.210 --> 06:16.470
- Good night.
- Good night.

06:23.850 --> 06:28.150
<i>17*****</i>

06:32.000 --> 06:33.730
Chelsea?

06:33.760 --> 06:36.150
I'm not upset anymore.

06:38.770 --> 06:40.970
Charlie, I'm sleeping.

06:40.990 --> 06:42.610
I know.

06:42.640 --> 06:46.370
Can you just wake up
enough so it's not weird?

06:49.410 --> 06:51.990
Never mind. Sweet dreams.

06:55.940 --> 07:01.290
Okay, let me remind you, this
is Malibu beachfront property.

07:01.320 --> 07:05.910
The previous owner had a spectacular
view as he filled his pockets with rocks

07:05.920 --> 07:08.290
and jumped into the pool.

07:10.120 --> 07:12.390
- Mom?
- Hang on.

07:12.810 --> 07:16.350
No, it's not a suicide home.

07:16.360 --> 07:20.400
At most it's... suicide adjacent.

07:21.160 --> 07:23.870
All right, get back to me.

07:24.770 --> 07:26.630
What are you doing here?

07:26.650 --> 07:29.600
What, I can't come
visit my mother at work?

07:29.630 --> 07:34.470
Well, I suppose you could, but I've been
here for 22 years and you never have.

07:34.480 --> 07:37.820
Well, maybe if you validated parking.

07:38.910 --> 07:41.230
Or any part of my life.

07:41.260 --> 07:43.030
What do you want, Charlie?

07:43.050 --> 07:48.670
Okay, first of all, I want to apologize for not
telling you about Chelsea and the engagement.

07:48.700 --> 07:52.040
I know that was wrong and selfish of me.

07:52.050 --> 07:53.220
Thank you.

07:53.250 --> 07:56.160
Good, I'm glad we got
that out of the way.

07:56.170 --> 07:59.110
So, I understand you guys
are having lunch tomorrow.

07:59.120 --> 08:00.870
Yes, we are. Is that a problem?

08:00.880 --> 08:02.800
No, no, no, it's great.

08:02.830 --> 08:06.080
I came all the way down here and paid
for my own parking to tell you it's great.

08:09.760 --> 08:13.060
All right, let's put
our cards on the table.

08:13.100 --> 08:15.170
What's your angle?

08:15.180 --> 08:17.630
Angle? I have no angle.

08:17.640 --> 08:20.530
Yeah, and I have no hangover.

08:20.760 --> 08:24.310
Look, Charlie, if you're really
going to marry this woman,

08:24.340 --> 08:26.390
I want to get started on
the right foot with her.

08:26.440 --> 08:29.680
I don't want to make the same
mistake I made with Alan's wife June.

08:29.710 --> 08:30.590
Judith.

08:30.610 --> 08:33.030
Oh, whatever.

08:33.330 --> 08:35.940
Heinous woman.

08:35.950 --> 08:40.380
The fact remains, had I overlooked
that and welcomed her into the family,

08:40.429 --> 08:43.740
she wouldn't have kept me at arm's
length all during Jake's formative years

08:43.789 --> 08:46.110
and I'd have a better
relationship with him today.

08:46.140 --> 08:48.040
Do you want a better
relationship with him?

08:48.070 --> 08:50.790
Not the way he is now.

08:52.150 --> 08:57.010
But if I'd gotten to him earlier, he
wouldn't have the manners of an outhouse rat.

08:58.240 --> 09:02.320
So, bottom line: you want a
good relationship with Chelsea

09:02.350 --> 09:05.230
so you can get your hooks
into the next generation?

09:05.250 --> 09:09.200
Can't I just want to be a
loving mother and grandmother?

09:09.210 --> 09:14.130
Well, I suppose you could, but I've
been here 40 years and you never have.

09:17.580 --> 09:19.860
Evelyn Harper.

09:19.880 --> 09:22.720
Oh, hello, Dr. Yakimora. What's up?

09:23.210 --> 09:27.390
That is good news. What's the address?

09:28.930 --> 09:31.750
Nice neighborhood. Thanks for the tip.

09:33.410 --> 09:34.600
What's the good news?

09:34.640 --> 09:37.620
Massive coronary in Brentwood.

09:37.880 --> 09:43.120
Six bedrooms, four baths, and a fully equipped
gym that that idiot shouldn't have been using.

09:44.280 --> 09:49.180
Now, if you'll excuse me, Mommy has
to fly faster than the other vultures.

10:16.960 --> 10:21.050
You mother took me to the most
adorable little restaurant.

10:21.100 --> 10:23.050
No kidding.

10:23.080 --> 10:25.510
It's called Mon Grenier du Vivre.

10:25.550 --> 10:27.260
You know what that means?

10:27.290 --> 10:30.430
Probably "The Spider's Web. "

10:30.440 --> 10:31.830
Charlie...

10:31.860 --> 10:34.380
The Devil's Barbecue?

10:34.900 --> 10:36.530
Be nice.

10:36.550 --> 10:38.660
Sorry.

10:40.160 --> 10:42.920
Bitch in the Box?

10:45.620 --> 10:47.180
So what did you guys talk about?

10:47.200 --> 10:49.180
You know, everything.

10:49.190 --> 10:51.650
She's so smart and funny.

10:51.670 --> 10:54.510
She's been through so
much. She's a real survivor.

10:54.520 --> 10:59.210
Just remember, in order for her to
be a survivor, others had to die.

10:59.580 --> 11:02.900
Okay, that's enough. Your
mom's a terrific lady.

11:02.910 --> 11:08.010
And I'm starting to think that any problem
you have with her is your problem, not hers.

11:08.060 --> 11:10.160
Oh, damn, it's too late.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.850
You're infected with the virus.

11:12.870 --> 11:14.580
Stop it.

11:14.600 --> 11:18.770
I'm sorry, but when you fall asleep
tonight, I'm gonna have to set you on fire.

11:19.080 --> 11:20.630
Shut up.

11:20.650 --> 11:24.780
Believe me, Charlie, when you meet
my mom, you'll thank God for Evelyn.

11:25.180 --> 11:29.900
What the hell is your mom, a rabid
werewolf that craps hot lava on people?

11:30.890 --> 11:34.660
Never mind about my mother. Let's play.

11:34.670 --> 11:36.620
I don't know.

11:36.650 --> 11:38.520
What's the matter?

11:38.530 --> 11:41.340
All this talk about
mothers, I'm not in the mood.

11:41.380 --> 11:43.180
I bet I could get you in the mood.

11:43.210 --> 11:46.490
Maybe, but it'd be a cheap manipulation.

11:48.320 --> 11:51.980
All right, but don't come rubbing up
against me in the middle of the night.

11:52.010 --> 11:53.380
I won't.

11:53.400 --> 11:56.590
- Fine. Good night.
- Good night.

12:04.990 --> 12:08.970
<i>22*********</i>

12:10.370 --> 12:13.120
Don't even think about it.

12:19.590 --> 12:21.790
Listen, you gotta do me a favor.

12:21.830 --> 12:24.190
That's what I live for.

12:24.210 --> 12:26.650
Sarcasm is for winners, Alan.

12:31.140 --> 12:32.690
What can I do for you?

12:32.710 --> 12:35.970
Chelsea's somehow gotten it
into her head that Mom is,

12:35.980 --> 12:41.550
you know, human, and you
need to set her straight.

12:41.570 --> 12:42.620
Why don't you set her straight?

12:42.650 --> 12:44.660
I tried, but she doesn't believe me.

12:44.700 --> 12:47.870
Probably because I turned out okay.

12:49.220 --> 12:55.090
She needs to hear about Mom from somebody whose life
is completely wrecked and unsalvageable, i. e., you.

12:55.870 --> 12:58.310
Thanks. And what do
you expect me to say?

12:59.840 --> 13:02.460
I don't know. Just tell
her about your phobias,

13:02.470 --> 13:05.850
your obsessions, your failures
with work, marriage, and parenthood.

13:05.880 --> 13:08.420
She'll connect the dots.

13:08.730 --> 13:10.600
You know what? I think I'll pass.

13:10.610 --> 13:14.400
Oh, come on. I always back
you up when you need me.

13:14.410 --> 13:17.440
When have you ever backed me up?

13:17.820 --> 13:20.990
Okay, let's just stay
focused on my problems.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.690
Listen, Charlie, I'm not gonna argue
that we didn't have a difficult childhood,

13:23.720 --> 13:25.860
but really, who had a good one?

13:25.910 --> 13:28.670
And isn't it time we forgive and forget?

13:28.680 --> 13:30.030
Where's this coming from?

13:30.070 --> 13:33.070
No, I'm just saying that
maybe our lives would be richer

13:33.110 --> 13:36.640
if we let go of this pointless
resentment toward our mother and,

13:36.650 --> 13:39.480
and just moved on with our lives.

13:39.510 --> 13:42.040
She got to you, didn't she?

13:42.050 --> 13:43.510
What are you talking about?

13:43.550 --> 13:46.640
What did she do? Pay off your car?

13:47.390 --> 13:50.400
Get that dead black tooth fixed?

13:50.710 --> 13:53.290
Oh, listen to yourself. Excuse
me. I have to go to work.

13:53.750 --> 13:56.260
- Hold it.
- What?

13:56.610 --> 13:59.080
- Your watch.
- What about it?

13:59.090 --> 14:02.170
It doesn't have Hamburglars
on the wristband.

14:04.600 --> 14:06.260
So?

14:06.300 --> 14:08.460
- Let me see it.
- No, it's mine.

14:09.320 --> 14:12.420
Let me see it! Let me see it!

14:14.910 --> 14:17.180
This is a Rolex.

14:17.210 --> 14:19.080
You sold me out for a watch.

14:19.110 --> 14:21.450
Hey, I did not sell you out for a watch!

14:21.490 --> 14:24.780
I sold you out for a
certified Swiss chronometer.

14:26.240 --> 14:30.070
Stainless steel Submariner,
waterproof up to 300 mets.

14:30.080 --> 14:32.860
And look, it winds itself.

14:36.050 --> 14:38.840
Put it on your right
arm, it'll run forever.

14:45.060 --> 14:47.160
Oh, good thinking.

14:47.180 --> 14:49.210
Oh, hey, look what else I got.

14:49.220 --> 14:52.400
Genuine porcelain veneer.

14:53.200 --> 14:56.030
From an English-speaking dentist.

14:56.640 --> 14:59.990
From an English-speaking dentist.

15:02.220 --> 15:03.780
Hey, Jake, I need a favor.

15:03.810 --> 15:06.900
Sorry, I can't say bad
things about Grandma.

15:06.910 --> 15:09.080
Okay, what did she buy you?

15:09.110 --> 15:11.420
A new guitar? Minibike?

15:11.430 --> 15:13.620
Pizza.

15:14.310 --> 15:16.680
You sold me out for a pizza?

15:16.690 --> 15:20.200
Not just a pizza. A meat-lover's pizza.

15:26.110 --> 15:31.800
* M is for the misery she caused me

15:32.870 --> 15:37.150
* O is for the other things she did

15:38.600 --> 15:45.280
* T is for the traitor who's my brother

15:45.290 --> 15:51.660
* H is for the... hump who is his kid

15:52.730 --> 15:57.330
No, it's true. They can
bleach anything these days.

15:57.340 --> 16:00.070
Really? It's gotta burn like hell.

16:00.080 --> 16:02.770
Oh, like a lit cigar.

16:03.720 --> 16:07.690
But it's worth. Curb appeal
isn't just for the front door.

16:08.270 --> 16:13.730
* E is for extremely
frightening girl talk.

16:14.450 --> 16:15.420
Hey, honey.

16:15.450 --> 16:16.580
How was shopping?

16:16.600 --> 16:19.030
Mom, pick up any new souls?

16:20.780 --> 16:22.940
Charlie, that's uncalled for.

16:22.960 --> 16:26.440
It's okay, Chelsea.
He can't help himself.

16:26.450 --> 16:27.820
Yes, he can.

16:27.840 --> 16:31.080
There's no excuse for speaking
to your mother that way.

16:31.090 --> 16:33.540
You don't know that.

16:34.030 --> 16:36.250
Evelyn, thank you for a wonderful day.

16:36.280 --> 16:40.300
The pleasure was mine. It's nice
to be appreciated for a change.

16:40.310 --> 16:42.720
- Are we on for yoga tomorrow?
- Can't wait.

16:44.270 --> 16:47.270
Oh, and of course, you and Charlie
are coming for dinner on Saturday.

16:47.310 --> 16:50.800
- We wouldn't miss it.
- Um, uh, actually...

16:51.130 --> 16:53.700
Chels, we have plans
on Saturday, remember?

16:53.930 --> 16:55.100
What plans?

16:55.130 --> 16:58.110
Oh, for God's sake,
can't you just play along?

17:00.000 --> 17:03.180
- We'll be there.
- Wonderful. Ta-ta.

17:05.720 --> 17:09.339
- Are you proud of yourself?
- Not really. I lost that one.

17:11.569 --> 17:16.690
* R is for the rifle in my mouth

17:19.220 --> 17:25.720
* Put them all together,
they spell "mother"

17:25.730 --> 17:31.310
* A word that's only half of how I feel.

17:41.340 --> 17:45.330
Hello, I am Alan Cousteau.

17:47.810 --> 17:53.600
I left the Calypso at... 0500 hours,

17:54.160 --> 17:58.450
and have descended to
a depth of 60 fathoms.

17:58.460 --> 18:03.720
And yet my Rolex is
keeping perfect time.

18:06.020 --> 18:09.590
Oh, ok, there goes a giant squid.

18:10.210 --> 18:12.050
Alan?

18:16.330 --> 18:18.540
Yes?

18:18.560 --> 18:21.110
What are you doing?

18:24.160 --> 18:27.010
I got no good answer.

18:28.230 --> 18:31.090
It's Saturday night, and I'm all alone.

18:31.100 --> 18:32.290
Do you know where Charlie is?

18:32.330 --> 18:35.250
We're supposed to be at
your mother's at 7:00.

18:35.260 --> 18:38.170
Oh, you are cutting it close.

18:40.350 --> 18:41.730
Have you seen him?

18:41.770 --> 18:43.950
Uh, not for a couple of
hours. Have you tried his cell?

18:43.960 --> 18:47.280
I did. There's no answer.
I'm getting worried.

18:47.290 --> 18:49.250
Chelsea, I'm home.

18:49.280 --> 18:51.170
Thank goodness.

18:52.300 --> 18:54.950
I return to the deep.

18:56.170 --> 18:57.590
Where have you been?

18:57.620 --> 19:01.490
Picking up a little
surprise for you. Come on in.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.240
Mom?

19:04.260 --> 19:06.930
Hello, sweetie.

19:07.840 --> 19:11.230
Ooh, feels like you gave
up on the Jenny Craig, huh?

19:13.060 --> 19:14.280
What are you doing here?

19:14.310 --> 19:15.970
I flew her in from Illinois.

19:15.990 --> 19:18.410
First class. Very swanky.

19:18.420 --> 19:22.560
Of course, I had some rich Jew lawyer
chewing my ear off the whole way.

19:23.290 --> 19:25.000
Tell her about the food.

19:25.050 --> 19:30.420
Oh, the food was terrific, but the
flight attendant was a colored homo.

19:32.680 --> 19:38.210
I'm glad they make 'em pick up the dinner
rolls with tongs 'cause I can't risk the AIDS.

19:40.540 --> 19:41.880
I hope you didn't fill up.

19:41.910 --> 19:43.560
We're going to my mom's for dinner.

19:43.580 --> 19:45.900
Oh, how nice.

19:45.910 --> 19:47.810
Now be honest with me, Charlie.

19:47.850 --> 19:52.250
You're sdark and handsome, you
gotta have some dago in ya, right?

19:55.610 --> 19:58.490
God, I love your mom.

20:03.890 --> 20:06.860
That was the worst dinner of my life.

20:07.640 --> 20:10.970
Really? I thought the
two moms hit it off.

20:10.980 --> 20:14.030
Kinda country mouse, city mouse.

20:14.060 --> 20:18.370
I especially liked the partrt when
country mouse kicked off her shoes,

20:18.410 --> 20:22.850
put her big yellow bunions on
city mouse's mahogany coffee table

20:22.860 --> 20:27.040
and asked her how she liked having
a commie A-rab for a president.

20:28.670 --> 20:30.660
You've made your point, Charlie.

20:30.690 --> 20:33.610
Point? Whatever do you mean?

20:33.970 --> 20:36.820
You leave my mother alone,
and I'll leave yours alone.

20:36.850 --> 20:38.520
Well, gosh, I don't know.

20:38.550 --> 20:41.310
I've really taken a shine to your mom.

20:41.330 --> 20:44.880
She promised to teach me how to
chew tobacco and burn a cross.

20:45.390 --> 20:47.170
Do we have a deal or not?

20:47.200 --> 20:48.920
Deal. Come here.

20:48.930 --> 20:51.030
I'm not in the mood.

20:51.060 --> 20:55.240
All right, but don't be rubbing up
against me in the middle of the night.

20:55.760 --> 20:58.710
Don't worry. I won't. Good night.

20:58.720 --> 21:01.140
Good night.

21:08.980 --> 21:11.730
All right, I was bluffing.

21:12.990 --> 21:15.200
Feel free to rub.

21:15.210 --> 21:17.930
Ruyourself.

21:19.590 --> 21:22.080
- Chels?
- What?

21:23.270 --> 21:26.300
Can you watch me so it's not weird?
