02:01.741 --> 02:03.868
The subject's name is John Kramer,

02:03.943 --> 02:06.776
a 52-year-old male Caucasian.

02:09.582 --> 02:11.447
He's seen better days.

02:46.186 --> 02:48.407
We have a recent rectangular
transection

02:48.621 --> 02:50.748
to the left occipital lobe.

02:51.891 --> 02:53.984
Some kind of backdoor
brain surgery.

04:25.285 --> 04:27.583
Let's check the stomach.

04:45.638 --> 04:48.630
What the hell?

04:50.910 --> 04:53.743
Get homicide here, now.

05:01.521 --> 05:02.988
Where is it?

05:03.056 --> 05:05.752
It was in his stomach.

05:07.627 --> 05:09.094
Cut it out.

05:42.562 --> 05:44.530
<i>Are you there, Detective?</i>

05:44.597 --> 05:46.792
<i>If so, you are probably</i>

05:46.866 --> 05:49.164
<i>the last man standing.</i>

05:49.235 --> 05:51.635
<i>Now perhaps you will succeed</i>

05:51.704 --> 05:54.138
<i>where the others have failed.</i>

05:54.207 --> 05:57.108
<i>You think you will
walk away untested?</i>

05:57.176 --> 05:58.973
<i>I promise</i>

05:59.045 --> 06:01.479
<i>that my work will continue.</i>

06:01.548 --> 06:04.540
<i>You think it's over
just because I'm dead?</i>

06:04.617 --> 06:06.585
<i>It's not over.</i>

06:06.653 --> 06:09.213
<i>The games have just begun.</i>

06:21.167 --> 06:25.263
What the fuck? What the fuck?

06:26.306 --> 06:28.274
What the fuck?

06:28.341 --> 06:31.139
My eyes!

06:31.210 --> 06:33.576
What the fuck?
What the fuck?

06:33.646 --> 06:36.046
What the fuck is this?

06:45.925 --> 06:47.222
Who's that?

06:48.695 --> 06:51.061
Talk to me.
What are you doing?

06:51.130 --> 06:53.098
Talk to me.

07:06.579 --> 07:07.739
Talk to me.

07:15.121 --> 07:16.713
Stop it!

07:18.224 --> 07:19.714
Stop.

07:26.799 --> 07:27.959
Stop it.

07:50.857 --> 07:53.485
What are you doing to me?

07:53.559 --> 07:55.993
What did I do?
Help!

07:56.062 --> 07:57.427
Help!

07:57.497 --> 07:59.931
Who's doing this to me?

08:14.814 --> 08:16.714
Just get away from me!

08:23.256 --> 08:25.247
What did I do?

09:57.917 --> 10:00.977
- Right side clear.
- Left side clear.

10:01.053 --> 10:02.315
<i>Clear.</i>

10:06.126 --> 10:08.356
<i>In position.
Standing by.</i>

10:08.828 --> 10:10.796
Hold right there.

10:12.732 --> 10:14.165
I see movement.

10:19.005 --> 10:21.098
We have a device.

10:21.174 --> 10:22.641
You get eyes in there
before you go in.

10:22.708 --> 10:24.938
Get some eyes in here.

10:25.011 --> 10:26.979
Moving now.

10:42.862 --> 10:44.124
The doorway is clear.

11:19.866 --> 11:21.094
It's Kerry!

11:21.167 --> 11:23.533
- Rigg!
- Don't do it! We're not secure!

11:23.603 --> 11:25.571
- Rigg, I said no!
- Kerry!

11:25.638 --> 11:27.833
- Stop him!
- Do not go through that door.

11:28.875 --> 11:30.843
Kerry!

11:30.910 --> 11:32.878
Shit.

11:56.502 --> 11:58.470
- Get me the coroner's office.
- Copy.

11:58.537 --> 12:00.505
Somebody get those rats off her.

12:05.878 --> 12:08.210
Let's get the light on this.

12:11.584 --> 12:13.575
Cut her down.

12:13.653 --> 12:15.484
You know I can't do that.

12:17.690 --> 12:20.022
I said cut her down.

12:21.460 --> 12:23.655
Please.

12:30.369 --> 12:32.132
Are you trying
to get yourself killed?

12:34.173 --> 12:36.471
You know never to go
through an unsecured door, ever.

12:36.542 --> 12:38.407
I thought she was still alive,

12:38.477 --> 12:41.105
thought I could save her.

12:42.281 --> 12:44.249
Did you ever think
that we would end up here

12:44.317 --> 12:46.285
when we first started?

12:47.920 --> 12:50.047
No.

12:50.122 --> 12:52.522
I didn't see it
happening like this.

12:55.628 --> 12:57.118
Why the hell do we still do it?

12:57.196 --> 12:59.756
It's in our nature to save them.

12:59.832 --> 13:02.528
- It's what we do.
- Right.

13:03.602 --> 13:05.934
"Cherish Your Life."

13:06.005 --> 13:07.802
- What?
- The fucking motto.

13:07.873 --> 13:11.001
We're supposed to cherish
our lives.

13:11.077 --> 13:12.635
How the hell are we
supposed to do that

13:12.712 --> 13:14.680
when this is our life?

13:18.784 --> 13:20.809
We chose this.

13:20.886 --> 13:22.751
- You go home.
- Hoffman, there are two agents

13:22.822 --> 13:25.222
- here to see you.
- Copy.

13:28.094 --> 13:30.289
- Detective Hoffman?
- Yes.

13:30.363 --> 13:32.729
I'm special agent Lindsey Perez.

13:32.798 --> 13:34.561
This is special agent Peter Strahm.

13:34.633 --> 13:36.692
How can I help the FBI?

13:36.769 --> 13:40.136
We're here about Detective Kerry.
She was our liaison.

13:40.206 --> 13:41.935
"Open the door
and you will find me."

13:42.975 --> 13:44.499
What?

13:49.181 --> 13:51.342
- What's this?
- The key that came

13:51.417 --> 13:53.317
with out last message
from Detective Kerry.

13:53.386 --> 13:55.877
"Open the door and you will find me"
mean anything to you?

13:55.955 --> 13:57.582
No.

14:05.664 --> 14:07.359
Where's the body?

14:07.433 --> 14:10.925
The crime scene photographer's flash
picked up this bullet casing.

14:11.003 --> 14:13.130
It was lodged between the body
and the device.

14:13.205 --> 14:15.173
Run it for prints.

14:22.214 --> 14:24.444
Give us the room for a minute,
would you? Thanks.

14:30.689 --> 14:32.623
The lock was open.

14:32.691 --> 14:34.124
She couldn't get out.

14:34.193 --> 14:38.095
It was constructed for her execution.
Betrayed the rules.

14:38.164 --> 14:39.893
Not a Jigsaw trap then?

14:39.965 --> 14:42.456
No, Amanda Young,
the accomplice...

14:42.535 --> 14:45.265
- This wasn't done by Amanda Young.
- Excuse me?

14:45.337 --> 14:47.601
Detective Kerry weighed
approximately 130 lbs.

14:47.673 --> 14:49.641
Amanda Young's arrest report
has her at 107.

14:49.708 --> 14:51.903
- She couldn't get her up there alone.
- John Kramer was...

14:51.977 --> 14:54.445
The bedridden cancer patient?
He's brains, not brawn.

14:54.513 --> 14:56.640
He was also an engineer.
He could have rigged pulleys...

14:56.715 --> 14:59.775
Or someone else
could have helped him.

14:59.852 --> 15:02.912
Special agent, if you're here for any
other reason than just to assist...

15:02.988 --> 15:05.479
We're here to find the person
your department couldn't, Detective,

15:05.558 --> 15:07.321
the one helping Jigsaw
and Amanda Young.

15:08.394 --> 15:10.362
Excuse me.

15:16.335 --> 15:19.361
We found a harlequin doll in your
possession. What's that about?

15:19.438 --> 15:21.633
It's a toy.
The kids play with toys.

15:21.707 --> 15:24.141
That's all it is.

15:24.210 --> 15:27.304
How about the tricycle?

15:27.379 --> 15:29.472
The tricycle is from John's youth.

15:29.548 --> 15:32.608
A grown man has
a tricycle his whole life?

15:32.685 --> 15:34.880
I'm sure you've kept things
that were important to you.

15:34.954 --> 15:37.047
Look, Ms. Tuck,

15:37.123 --> 15:39.091
is there any reason
we should be concerned

15:39.158 --> 15:41.217
for your safety?

15:41.293 --> 15:43.625
Perhaps you should be
more concerned for yourself.

15:43.696 --> 15:45.664
Why don't you tell me
everything you know about John?

15:45.731 --> 15:47.221
And let's start at the beginning.

15:47.299 --> 15:50.962
John's life defies chronology
and linear description.

15:51.036 --> 15:54.369
So why don't we start at the end
and work our way backwards?

15:54.440 --> 15:55.998
I represent Ms. Tuck.

15:58.310 --> 16:00.039
She knows something.

16:00.112 --> 16:02.171
I thought you were going home.

16:02.248 --> 16:05.945
You have vacation time, right?
Take it.

16:06.018 --> 16:08.350
Finish the remodeling,
spend some time with Tracy.

16:08.420 --> 16:10.888
- She understands.
- Then don't take her for granted.

16:11.924 --> 16:15.257
- Eric is still out there, man.
- Eric's been missing for six months.

16:15.327 --> 16:18.319
Kerry was gone for four days.
I can only be as optimistic

16:18.397 --> 16:20.865
- as the facts allow.
- Yeah, well, I'm in it till I find him.

16:20.933 --> 16:22.730
Finding his body is not gonna
vindicate us.

16:22.801 --> 16:24.666
Finding him alive will.

16:24.737 --> 16:26.864
It's time to let go.

16:26.939 --> 16:28.873
I want you to go home.

16:28.941 --> 16:31.739
I'll call you later to make sure
everything is okay.

16:36.615 --> 16:37.877
Who's he?

16:37.950 --> 16:39.713
Lieutenant Rigg,
our SWAT commander.

16:39.785 --> 16:43.152
- What's his problem?
- Everyone around him keeps dying.

17:04.210 --> 17:06.644
What's it say?

17:06.712 --> 17:09.771
It says, "I tried calling you
four times."

17:09.848 --> 17:12.180
It says, "Dinner is in the fridge."

17:13.986 --> 17:17.353
And at the bottom it says,
"I love you."

17:17.423 --> 17:19.482
I need to help my mom

17:19.558 --> 17:21.788
for a few days.

17:21.859 --> 17:23.691
Just...

17:23.762 --> 17:26.856
come with me, okay? Now.

17:26.932 --> 17:28.866
I can't.

17:30.436 --> 17:32.802
You can,

17:32.871 --> 17:35.271
but you won't.

17:35.341 --> 17:37.605
What you can't do

17:37.676 --> 17:39.871
is save everyone.

17:49.121 --> 17:50.918
Tracy.

17:50.990 --> 17:53.584
Tracy, please listen to me.

18:06.372 --> 18:09.808
John Kramer owned a company called
The Urban Renewal Group.

18:09.875 --> 18:11.968
No irony in that, huh?

18:12.044 --> 18:14.103
What was Rigg watching?

18:14.179 --> 18:18.081
Jill Tuck's interrogation.
She was Jigsaw's ex. It's old.

18:18.150 --> 18:20.118
Why is a SWAT guy watching that?

18:20.185 --> 18:24.087
Strahm, I really think
we should tell Hoffman

18:24.156 --> 18:26.090
what Detective Kerry said
in her last message.

18:26.158 --> 18:29.457
She said two officers
might be in danger,

18:29.528 --> 18:31.519
but until we know who,
we're not causing a panic.

18:31.597 --> 18:34.065
If Detective Hoffman or anyone else
in this precinct is in danger,

18:34.133 --> 18:35.964
- I think they should know it.
- Not your call.

18:39.872 --> 18:41.737
Making any progress?

18:43.475 --> 18:46.035
We're fine, thanks.

18:46.111 --> 18:48.841
Hey, boss, looks like another doctor
went missing from the hospital.

18:48.914 --> 18:50.848
- Maybe it's...
- Thanks.

18:50.916 --> 18:52.884
I'll check it out.

18:52.951 --> 18:55.920
If you need me, call my cell.
Coffee machine is around the corner.

18:55.988 --> 18:58.456
- A boy or a girl?
- A girl.

18:58.524 --> 19:00.116
- I didn't know you were married.
- I'm not.

19:00.192 --> 19:02.717
It's a short story, believe me.

19:24.316 --> 19:26.284
Tracy.

19:41.667 --> 19:42.895
Tracy?

21:27.940 --> 21:29.908
Hello, Officer Rigg.

21:29.975 --> 21:31.966
Welcome to your rebirth.

21:32.044 --> 21:33.238
Fuck.

21:33.312 --> 21:35.610
For years you've stood by
and witnessed

21:35.681 --> 21:37.649
as your colleagues have fallen.

21:37.716 --> 21:40.310
You have remained untouched

21:40.385 --> 21:42.819
while Eric Matthews
has disappeared.

21:42.888 --> 21:45.914
But with your survival
came your obsession...

21:45.991 --> 21:47.959
obsession to stop
those around you

21:48.026 --> 21:50.085
from making the wrong choices,

21:50.162 --> 21:53.188
thus preventing you
from making the right ones.

21:53.265 --> 21:55.233
You wanted to save everyone.

21:55.300 --> 21:57.427
Tonight I give you
the opportunity

21:57.503 --> 22:00.131
to face your obsession.
Look closely.

22:00.205 --> 22:03.368
Eric Matthews is still alive.

22:03.442 --> 22:06.138
- Eric.
- The block of ice he stands upon

22:06.211 --> 22:08.042
is melting.

22:08.113 --> 22:11.173
He has but 90 minutes
to save himself.

22:11.250 --> 22:15.243
Detective Hoffman's fate is linked
to Eric's survival.

22:15.320 --> 22:18.483
Heed my warning,
Officer Rigg.

22:18.557 --> 22:20.718
Their lives hang in the balance

22:20.792 --> 22:22.760
of your obsession.

22:22.828 --> 22:26.025
Will you learn how to let go
and truly save them?

22:26.098 --> 22:28.362
The choice is yours.

23:03.201 --> 23:05.465
Don't fucking move.

23:19.418 --> 23:21.283
Jesus.

23:21.353 --> 23:23.947
Take off the mask.
Put your hands in the air.

23:24.022 --> 23:26.388
I can't!

23:38.604 --> 23:40.538
Officer Rigg, your first test.

23:40.606 --> 23:43.939
The person in front of you
is in desperate need of help.

23:44.009 --> 23:46.569
But it is not your job
to save them.

23:46.645 --> 23:48.545
You view this person as a victim.

23:48.614 --> 23:50.605
But if you want to see what I see,

23:50.682 --> 23:53.242
beneath the mask lies a criminal

23:53.318 --> 23:55.286
undeserving of the life she leads.

24:01.727 --> 24:04.890
Your obsession tells you
to save the victim.

24:04.963 --> 24:09.127
I tell you to walk away.
The choice is yours.

24:10.302 --> 24:12.429
- Are you a cop?
- What?

24:12.504 --> 24:14.631
- Are you a cop?
- Yeah, I'm a cop.

24:17.709 --> 24:20.803
What is that?
What did you do?

24:29.388 --> 24:32.118
- They're in the gears.
- What's in the gears?

24:32.190 --> 24:35.489
The combination.
Get me out.

24:37.562 --> 24:40.087
Cut my hair. Just get me out.
Cut my hair.

24:40.165 --> 24:41.632
- Relax, relax.
- Hurry!

24:43.235 --> 24:45.635
Fucking cut my hair, please.

24:45.704 --> 24:47.194
Get me out!

24:49.808 --> 24:51.799
Please.
Where are you going?

24:51.877 --> 24:54.141
Wait wait wait wait.

24:54.212 --> 24:56.112
Wait wait.

24:56.181 --> 24:57.239
- Shit.
- Wait!

24:58.483 --> 25:00.246
Stop!

25:01.286 --> 25:02.651
Fucking let me out!

25:03.722 --> 25:06.156
Get back here, you fucking...!

25:07.225 --> 25:10.592
Okay, I'm sorry.
Please come back.

25:30.248 --> 25:32.978
Where the hell is the combination?

25:33.051 --> 25:34.882
Shit. Shit.

25:38.990 --> 25:40.958
Hold on! Hold on!

25:43.895 --> 25:46.295
I got one.

25:46.364 --> 25:48.730
I got one. Hold on!

25:48.800 --> 25:50.961
- Hold on.
- Hurry!

25:53.605 --> 25:55.368
Oh, God.

25:58.477 --> 26:01.071
- Yeah?
- We pulled a print off that casing.

26:01.146 --> 26:03.114
We've got a match.

26:03.181 --> 26:05.649
Jesus. Did you check this?

26:05.717 --> 26:06.775
Twice.

26:09.955 --> 26:11.388
Come on, come on, come on.

26:11.456 --> 26:14.254
I got another one. Hold on!

26:16.261 --> 26:18.058
- Hold on. Hold on.
- Hurry!

26:18.130 --> 26:20.257
I got it. 617. 617.

26:20.332 --> 26:22.300
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

26:28.273 --> 26:31.174
Go!

26:31.243 --> 26:34.110
Shit.

26:34.179 --> 26:36.613
Okay okay okay, listen,

26:36.681 --> 26:38.808
stay here. Don't touch anything.

27:00.972 --> 27:03.133
What the fuck?

27:05.911 --> 27:08.379
What the fuck are you doing?
What are you doing?

27:08.446 --> 27:09.743
Drop the fucking knife!

27:09.815 --> 27:11.680
- Please.
- Put the knife down.

27:11.750 --> 27:13.718
Put the knife down.

27:13.785 --> 27:16.379
I just saved your fucking life.

27:18.223 --> 27:20.657
- I'm gonna kill you!
- Drop the knife.

27:28.433 --> 27:32.233
Hey, these prints just came in.
They're from Officer Rigg.

27:32.304 --> 27:33.896
- Fisk.
- Not now.

27:33.972 --> 27:36.600
We just got a call of "shots fired"
from 23 Park Place.

27:36.675 --> 27:39.075
That's Rigg's apartment.

27:46.184 --> 27:48.152
Hello, Brenda.

27:48.220 --> 27:50.245
I want to play a game.

27:50.322 --> 27:53.189
An officer will try to save you.

27:53.258 --> 27:57.024
If he is successful,
then your game begins.

27:57.095 --> 27:59.563
This man will use these photos

27:59.631 --> 28:02.259
to sentence you for your crimes.

28:02.334 --> 28:04.302
And the only way to stop him

28:04.369 --> 28:06.360
is taped underneath the TV.

28:08.573 --> 28:10.541
Let him save your life

28:10.609 --> 28:12.975
and accept your fate
to rot in prison,

28:13.044 --> 28:15.512
or kill him

28:15.580 --> 28:17.810
and guarantee your freedom.

28:17.883 --> 28:20.249
Make your choice.

29:24.582 --> 29:26.550
I'll fucking kill you,

29:26.618 --> 29:29.052
you fucking bitch!

30:24.209 --> 30:26.336
Rigg!

30:27.379 --> 30:30.109
- Rigg, you in here? Rigg!
- Go! Move move move!

30:32.017 --> 30:33.985
Christ.

30:34.052 --> 30:36.020
I got one.

30:37.856 --> 30:39.824
I got one.

30:49.868 --> 30:51.836
It's started.

30:53.505 --> 30:56.030
An APB has been issued for Rigg.
Everybody's looking.

30:56.107 --> 30:59.133
- He has a wife. Where is she?
- We haven't located her yet.

30:59.210 --> 31:01.872
Strahm...

31:01.946 --> 31:04.312
two detectives. You see this?

31:05.350 --> 31:07.181
Hoffman... you got a 20 on him?

31:07.252 --> 31:08.583
Not yet.

31:08.653 --> 31:10.211
- Hoffman.
- Calling.

31:10.288 --> 31:12.381
How do you explain
Detective Matthews?

31:12.457 --> 31:14.288
- He's alive.
- Six months.

31:14.359 --> 31:17.487
- Jigsaw never kept anyone that long.
- No one but Amanda Young.

31:18.530 --> 31:20.395
You think he's been fixed?

31:20.465 --> 31:22.296
Why these six?

31:26.271 --> 31:28.933
Hoffman's a decorated lieutenant.
He doesn't fit the profile.

31:29.007 --> 31:31.976
That's what you see.
But what does he see?

31:33.244 --> 31:35.439
- Rigg trying to save his two friends.
- Maybe.

31:35.513 --> 31:37.947
You got names and locations
on any of these people?

31:38.016 --> 31:39.881
- Working it.
- This is overkill.

31:39.951 --> 31:42.579
It's a setup to announce
Rigg is the accomplice.

31:42.654 --> 31:45.521
Or a setup for his alibi.
Everyone around him keeps dying.

31:45.590 --> 31:48.320
Where is he to tell us he's innocent
or what the hell these photos

31:48.393 --> 31:51.521
are doing in his apartment?
Look there.

31:52.564 --> 31:55.533
Move, please.

31:55.600 --> 31:57.795
"Four Walls Build a Home."

31:57.869 --> 31:59.837
What does he want us to see
on these walls?

31:59.904 --> 32:01.838
The victims?

32:01.906 --> 32:04.670
One of these pictures
doesn't belong.

32:11.716 --> 32:13.684
This is who we're looking for.

32:14.752 --> 32:17.312
Let's talk to her, now.

32:22.494 --> 32:24.462
Jill Tuck... where is she?

32:32.837 --> 32:35.397
Have them turn off the air in there.

32:42.413 --> 32:44.005
Ms. Tuck,

32:44.082 --> 32:47.142
I'm special agent Perez.
This is special agent Strahm.

32:47.218 --> 32:49.743
I'd like to apologize for pulling
you out of your place of work.

32:49.821 --> 32:51.413
What more do you think
I can offer you?

32:51.489 --> 32:54.356
My 100 hours of interrogation tapes

32:54.425 --> 32:56.655
and the volumes of evidence
taken from my house

32:56.728 --> 32:59.060
weren't enough for you
to understand John?

33:00.131 --> 33:03.100
Actually, it's not John we want
to talk about, Ms. Tuck. It's you.

33:03.168 --> 33:04.658
Me?

33:04.736 --> 33:07.296
Why do you want to talk about me?
This isn't about me.

33:07.372 --> 33:10.205
So stop wasting both of our time
and get to the real reason

33:10.275 --> 33:12.675
why you've brought me here.

33:37.902 --> 33:39.870
Hey, you.

33:45.677 --> 33:48.077
Let me go!

33:48.146 --> 33:49.875
Hey!

33:51.783 --> 33:54.343
You hear me?

33:54.419 --> 33:56.182
You fucking hear me,

33:56.254 --> 33:59.052
you fucking motherfucker?

34:16.174 --> 34:17.801
Who's my girl?

34:21.012 --> 34:22.980
What the fuck are you looking at?

34:23.047 --> 34:24.775
Huh? What the fuck...?

34:24.849 --> 34:27.248
Hey, you!

34:27.318 --> 34:29.911
Sir, sir,

34:29.987 --> 34:32.013
sir, can I help you?

35:39.624 --> 35:41.592
Hello, Officer Rigg.
In order for you

35:41.659 --> 35:43.854
to fully understand my way,

35:43.928 --> 35:47.386
you must...
feel what I feel.

35:47.465 --> 35:49.831
The photo before you is of a man

35:49.901 --> 35:53.200
- in desperate need of help.
- Sir?

35:53.271 --> 35:56.866
In the next room are the tools
to his salvation.

35:56.941 --> 35:59.603
His life is in your hands.

35:59.677 --> 36:03.010
But in the end
only he can save himself.

36:04.582 --> 36:08.177
Be careful.
There are cameras watching...

36:10.455 --> 36:13.219
and you must hide your identity.

36:14.325 --> 36:16.850
Make your choice.

36:17.962 --> 36:19.987
- Sir?
- What the fuck's he doing?

36:20.064 --> 36:22.191
I don't know. You're gonna have to...
Look, look,

36:22.266 --> 36:24.257
- you're gonna have to go.
- People are trying to sleep.

36:24.335 --> 36:26.769
Yeah, I know people are
trying to sleep. You're the one...

36:26.838 --> 36:29.204
Yeah, you can't sleep here.
You have to go.

36:29.273 --> 36:31.605
Yeah, well, you can't sleep
in here, okay?

36:31.676 --> 36:34.042
That's not a bed.
No, you've got to go.

36:34.112 --> 36:36.376
No, you can't use the bathroom.
Look, look, no.

36:36.447 --> 36:37.880
You're gonna have to go.
All right...

36:44.122 --> 36:46.113
Chance, here, girl.

36:49.227 --> 36:53.186
Chance. Chance.

36:54.699 --> 36:57.327
Chance.

36:58.936 --> 37:00.904
What are you doing?
Come on.

37:00.972 --> 37:02.940
Chance.

37:09.647 --> 37:11.979
Chance, come here.
Come here.

37:20.158 --> 37:22.649
What you got there, huh?
What you got?

37:22.727 --> 37:25.093
Come here. Come here.
What do you got there?

37:33.805 --> 37:38.572
Okay, "Four walls build a home."

37:38.643 --> 37:41.874
- Care to shed any light on that?
- Light on what?

37:41.946 --> 37:44.039
On what your photos are doing
at the crime scene.

37:47.218 --> 37:49.379
"Four walls build a home"
ring any bells?

37:51.222 --> 37:53.656
"Cherish your life"?

37:55.026 --> 37:56.994
"Cherish your life"
is the concept

37:57.061 --> 37:59.029
that this whole clinic
was built on...

37:59.096 --> 38:01.121
cherish your life... your life.

38:01.199 --> 38:04.066
- That's his motto.
- No, it's your motto...

38:04.135 --> 38:06.831
of the clinic you run.

38:06.904 --> 38:10.203
Fuck, man.
I've been here for three fucking hours!

38:10.274 --> 38:12.674
- Shut the fuck up.
- You shut up.

38:12.743 --> 38:14.506
Are you out of your fucking mind?

38:14.579 --> 38:16.570
Hey hey.

38:16.647 --> 38:18.547
Hey, guys, come on.
Calm down.

38:18.616 --> 38:20.641
Cecil!

38:20.718 --> 38:22.845
Stop it, Gus.

38:22.920 --> 38:25.218
Knock it off now, please!

38:29.961 --> 38:31.826
You don't want to do that.

38:31.896 --> 38:34.057
- What the fuck is your problem?
- You're my problem.

38:35.099 --> 38:38.000
You're becoming
everybody else's too.

38:45.576 --> 38:49.569
How do you feel about a husband

38:49.647 --> 38:52.172
who takes a motto
from your drug clinic,

38:52.250 --> 38:54.548
designed to help people,
and twists it

38:54.619 --> 38:57.679
into some manic torture mantra?

38:57.755 --> 39:01.282
That part of John
has nothing to do with me.

39:04.428 --> 39:06.396
Look, Ms. Tuck,
I just left a room

39:06.464 --> 39:08.432
with more blood on the walls
than paint.

39:08.499 --> 39:11.332
Two officers are missing and
there's a growing pile of bodies

39:11.402 --> 39:14.838
in their wake.
And every detail we unearth

39:14.906 --> 39:17.568
about your Hall of Fame
psychopath husband...

39:17.642 --> 39:19.269
- Ex.
...points to you

39:19.343 --> 39:21.140
as a possible accomplice.

39:21.212 --> 39:24.477
I am just curious as to why.

39:24.549 --> 39:26.574
You know, there's a lot of people
out there

39:26.651 --> 39:28.619
looking for answers,

39:28.686 --> 39:30.916
wanting to place blame
on someone.

39:30.988 --> 39:33.821
That person is you.

39:33.891 --> 39:35.984
But you know
what the best part is?

39:36.060 --> 39:38.290
I don't have to
convince everybody.

39:38.362 --> 39:40.557
Just 12 people.

39:42.867 --> 39:46.030
Okay, tell me
about his workshop.

39:52.076 --> 39:54.442
Stay there.
Let me get the lights.

39:57.949 --> 39:59.314
Wow, it's big.

39:59.383 --> 40:02.614
This is exactly
what you've been looking for.

40:02.687 --> 40:03.949
Nice, huh?

40:05.122 --> 40:06.749
Ta-da!

40:06.824 --> 40:10.419
This is the clock?
What's so special about it?

40:10.494 --> 40:12.655
Except for the fact
the whole deal hung on it?

40:12.730 --> 40:14.630
The mechanism inside it.

40:14.699 --> 40:16.929
It's 300 years old.

40:17.001 --> 40:18.935
Still ticking.

40:19.003 --> 40:21.995
Withstood the test of time.

40:24.475 --> 40:27.501
Wait till you see this space.

40:32.249 --> 40:34.649
I've got a surprise for you.

40:49.033 --> 40:51.001
Why are you doing this?

40:52.770 --> 40:54.738
Why?

40:58.509 --> 41:00.636
This was... this was a mistake.

41:00.711 --> 41:04.147
It happened a long time ago.
And I paid for this.

41:04.215 --> 41:06.012
Just let me...
just let me go, okay?

41:09.253 --> 41:11.517
What's behind that door?

41:11.589 --> 41:14.922
"One saves a life.
One takes it away."

41:17.461 --> 41:19.429
Try that on the door.
Try that.

41:25.102 --> 41:27.127
- Oh, no no.
- Get back. Get back. Get back.

41:27.204 --> 41:28.796
Let's go. Go.

42:02.139 --> 42:05.267
Eric. Jesus.

42:05.342 --> 42:08.106
- Help! Help me!
- Get away from there.

42:09.780 --> 42:12.749
What do you know about the guy on TV?
What do you know about Eric Matthews?

42:12.817 --> 42:14.785
I don't know who that is.

42:16.787 --> 42:18.982
- What the fuck is this?
- I don't know.

42:22.827 --> 42:25.421
What are you gonna do to me?

42:27.665 --> 42:30.657
If you are playing this tape,
then you are one step closer

42:30.735 --> 42:33.863
to truly understanding
how to save a life.

42:33.938 --> 42:36.736
As an officer of the law,
you find yourself torn...

42:36.807 --> 42:38.502
- Who is that?
- Shut up.

42:38.576 --> 42:41.739
- is the man before you a victim
or a perpetrator of violence?

42:43.547 --> 42:45.014
You sick fuck.

42:45.082 --> 42:47.312
His salvation is out of your hands.

42:50.154 --> 42:51.985
It is your choice, if you wish,

42:52.056 --> 42:54.024
to put it into his own.

42:54.091 --> 42:56.059
Once this lesson is learned,

42:56.127 --> 42:58.118
you will find yourself
one step closer

42:58.195 --> 43:00.755
to truly saving Eric Matthews.

43:00.831 --> 43:03.800
Without you this man's game
cannot begin.

43:03.868 --> 43:07.395
Force him into position
to face his demons

43:07.471 --> 43:10.463
and let him make the decision.

43:16.080 --> 43:19.140
Shh. Don't wake up our neighbors.

43:21.485 --> 43:24.579
Fuck. Is this what you do
with your spare time, huh?

43:24.655 --> 43:25.781
No.

43:25.856 --> 43:28.654
Take it all, little girl.
Be a good little whore.

43:28.726 --> 43:31.388
Get on the fucking bed.
Get on the bed!

43:31.462 --> 43:33.828
Move!

43:33.898 --> 43:36.458
Strap yourself in.
Strap yourself in.

43:36.534 --> 43:38.661
Please don't make me do this.
I know...

43:38.736 --> 43:40.897
I know I was wrong.
I know.

43:42.873 --> 43:45.000
Hurry up. Hurry up.

43:45.075 --> 43:47.908
Put your fucking hands up.

43:49.280 --> 43:51.475
I don't know. I don't know.

43:51.549 --> 43:52.880
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

43:57.121 --> 44:00.181
Listen, I'm really sorry.

44:00.257 --> 44:03.385
What does that say?
What does that say?

44:04.728 --> 44:06.559
What is that?

44:10.568 --> 44:12.866
- Take them.
- Why?

44:17.141 --> 44:19.507
Hello, Ivan. As a voyeur,

44:19.577 --> 44:22.273
you've kept photos of those
you have victimized.

44:23.314 --> 44:25.282
- Let me go!
- Can you see the pain

44:25.349 --> 44:27.317
you have brought them?

44:27.384 --> 44:29.579
You have torn apart their lives.

44:29.653 --> 44:33.350
You have used your body
as an instrument of abuse.

44:33.424 --> 44:35.756
Now I give you the chance
to decide

44:35.826 --> 44:38.795
what is more important...

44:38.863 --> 44:42.230
your eyes which have led you
blindly astray

44:42.299 --> 44:44.597
or your body

44:44.668 --> 44:46.636
which has caused those around you

44:46.704 --> 44:49.104
endless suffering.

44:49.173 --> 44:52.233
You have been handed the tools
which can save your life.

44:52.309 --> 44:55.107
Decide quickly, though.
In 60 seconds

44:55.179 --> 44:58.876
the choice will be made for you.

45:10.761 --> 45:13.127
I can do it. One more.
I can do it.

45:43.127 --> 45:45.095
You're gonna have to tell me
how you got

45:45.162 --> 45:48.598
those bruises on your hand
and your neck.

45:49.667 --> 45:53.364
Was this an accident or did someone
do this to you on purpose?

45:53.437 --> 45:57.567
You can stop it from happening
if you tell me the truth.

45:58.676 --> 46:00.940
Take a seat, please.

46:01.011 --> 46:02.706
I want to go home now.

46:08.052 --> 46:09.883
The son of a bitch is lying.

46:09.954 --> 46:12.787
He's done this before.
She's allowing it.

46:12.856 --> 46:16.348
The child's story doesn't corroborate.
What can I do?

46:16.427 --> 46:18.861
Jane, I can't let you go home
right now, okay?

46:18.929 --> 46:20.692
Go back to class, honey.

46:20.764 --> 46:22.891
I told you, Officers,
sometimes these kids...

46:22.967 --> 46:25.060
they just get out of control.

46:25.135 --> 46:27.103
- Get your hands off me!
- Hey, take it easy.

46:27.171 --> 46:28.968
Rigg! Rigg!

46:29.039 --> 46:32.805
No. Get out. Get out now.

46:32.876 --> 46:35.071
You just made the biggest
mistake of your life.

46:35.145 --> 46:36.908
You hear me?
I will take him

46:36.981 --> 46:39.677
for everything he's got,
that fucking cocksucker.

46:40.784 --> 46:42.752
That's sweet, Ms. Tuck,

46:42.820 --> 46:45.721
but if you love the guy so much,
why leave him?

46:45.789 --> 46:48.451
- He left me long before I left him.
- Okay, people break up.

46:48.525 --> 46:50.652
Relationships end.
It's called life.

46:50.728 --> 46:53.390
I mean, he started
massacring people.

46:53.464 --> 46:55.932
- Gideon meant everything to him.
- Gideon? I'm sorry, who?

46:56.000 --> 46:58.992
Do you know anything
about the Chinese zodiac?

46:59.069 --> 47:01.094
Aw, Jill, no no.

47:01.171 --> 47:03.139
I didn't just get pregnant.

47:03.207 --> 47:05.175
It was carefully planned.

47:05.242 --> 47:08.234
Everything with John was.

47:11.115 --> 47:12.639
- Thanks.
- See you.

47:12.716 --> 47:14.684
- Bye-bye.
- Bye. Let me get that for you.

47:14.752 --> 47:17.448
Thank you.

47:17.521 --> 47:19.682
- Thanks. Have a good night.
- You too.

47:19.757 --> 47:21.349
- Good night.
- Good night.

47:26.063 --> 47:28.759
Hey, honey,
you want some company?

47:28.832 --> 47:31.460
What are you doing?

47:31.535 --> 47:33.503
You know what this building is?

47:36.640 --> 47:38.904
It's a health clinic.

47:38.976 --> 47:41.877
You're a beautiful girl.
Go home.

47:48.485 --> 47:50.316
My jacket.
I forgot my jacket.

47:50.387 --> 47:52.355
- I forgot my jacket.
- Cecil, no.

47:52.423 --> 47:54.118
Oh, please please, Jill.
It's right there.

47:54.191 --> 47:57.592
Look, it's right there.
Please please. Come on.

47:58.629 --> 48:00.597
Thank you.

48:08.672 --> 48:10.640
Thanks.

48:12.476 --> 48:14.637
Listen to me.
I don't want to hurt you, all right?

48:14.711 --> 48:16.269
You're gonna open up
that fucking door.

48:16.346 --> 48:18.814
Open that fucking door.
Open it.

48:18.882 --> 48:21.180
Open it.

48:21.251 --> 48:23.981
Fuck!
What fucking key?

48:24.054 --> 48:26.181
- What key?
- That one.

48:26.256 --> 48:28.019
Fuck.

48:30.394 --> 48:31.986
Fucking stay there.

48:35.299 --> 48:37.267
Cecil?

48:56.086 --> 48:59.419
Don't cry.
No no, hey, you're gonna be okay.

49:02.526 --> 49:04.494
Fuck.

49:17.274 --> 49:18.901
I need some help here.

49:18.976 --> 49:21.035
Orderly.

49:21.111 --> 49:22.840
This is my wife.
She's pregnant.

49:22.913 --> 49:25.711
- How far along is she, sir?
- Seven months.

50:06.924 --> 50:09.324
All I wanted to do was help them.

50:10.594 --> 50:13.062
You can't help them.

50:14.198 --> 50:16.166
They have to help themselves.

50:27.044 --> 50:30.172
Okay, let's review:

50:30.247 --> 50:32.215
Girl loves boy.
Boy loves girl.

50:32.282 --> 50:36.218
Boy gets girl pregnant.
Girl loses baby.

50:36.286 --> 50:39.483
Boy turns into a serial killer.

50:39.556 --> 50:42.684
Jill, I'm not buying it.

50:43.727 --> 50:45.854
You're gonna want
to take a look at this.

50:45.929 --> 50:47.897
All right, she doesn't leave.

50:59.443 --> 51:02.207
He's been identified
as Ivan Landsness.

51:02.279 --> 51:04.304
Acquitted of rape three times.

51:04.381 --> 51:07.407
Had to gouge out his own eyes
in order to release himself.

51:08.652 --> 51:11.712
How does something like this
get into a motel room undetected?

51:11.788 --> 51:13.756
Piece by piece.

51:13.824 --> 51:15.849
The room's been rented
for the past six days

51:15.926 --> 51:19.225
to a lawyer named Art Blank.
Get this: he went missing two weeks ago.

51:19.296 --> 51:20.991
Run his name.
Get his addresses.

51:21.064 --> 51:24.500
Two out of five people on Officer Rigg's
apartment walls are dead.

51:24.568 --> 51:27.435
Every partner
he's ever worked with... dead.

51:27.504 --> 51:30.803
Rigg didn't kill Ivan.
Ivan made his own choice.

51:30.874 --> 51:32.808
Isn't that the whole Jigsaw mantra?

51:32.876 --> 51:34.673
This wasn't about Ivan.
It wasn't his test.

51:34.745 --> 51:37.680
It was about Rigg.

51:37.748 --> 51:39.841
Look at these photos.
Tell me how you feel.

51:39.916 --> 51:41.713
Look at these women and tell me
how you feel.

51:41.785 --> 51:43.776
- Angry. Enraged.
- Exactly.

51:43.854 --> 51:48.018
The pimp, the rapist...
Jigsaw wanted Rigg to see what he sees.

51:48.091 --> 51:51.424
He wants him to feel what he feels.

51:51.495 --> 51:53.861
This wasn't about Rigg
saving his friends.

51:53.930 --> 51:56.694
He's being recruited.

51:56.767 --> 51:59.736
Thanks. Art Blank's got
a bunch of properties.

51:59.803 --> 52:02.169
Last known address
is a couple of blocks from here.

52:08.679 --> 52:11.739
- Right side clear.
- Left side clear.

52:11.815 --> 52:13.544
- Clear.
- Clear.

52:13.617 --> 52:15.585
Clear.

52:34.738 --> 52:37.138
What does this mean?

52:37.207 --> 52:40.005
We're the two Jigsaw targets.

52:53.790 --> 52:55.758
Fuck you.

53:00.931 --> 53:02.865
Hey.

53:03.900 --> 53:06.892
Hey. Hey.

53:22.953 --> 53:25.751
Hey, asshole,
you jump off that block,

53:25.822 --> 53:27.346
you electrocute him.

53:27.424 --> 53:30.882
If that ice had melted more,
he'd be fried. You understand?

53:30.961 --> 53:32.929
Listen to him.

53:41.972 --> 53:44.099
You just made the biggest
mistake of your life,

53:44.174 --> 53:45.471
- cocksucker!
- Calm down.

53:45.542 --> 53:47.601
We'll get somebody to take
a look at it, all right?

53:47.677 --> 53:50.908
My client has a broken nose
and a fractured cheekbone.

53:50.981 --> 53:54.678
Administrative leave with pay
is not acceptable.

53:56.019 --> 53:58.385
The IA investigation is underway.

53:59.790 --> 54:02.418
Into this precinct? Wow.
What's that gonna get me, huh?

54:02.492 --> 54:04.687
- The truth.
- I'll tell you what the truth is.

54:04.761 --> 54:07.321
The truth is,
I have an eyewitness.

54:07.397 --> 54:10.025
The man's wife? She stands to gain
as much as he does

54:10.100 --> 54:12.068
if there were to be
a financial settlement,

54:12.135 --> 54:13.796
which is not gonna happen
because he's lying.

54:13.870 --> 54:15.838
He attacked Officer Rigg first.

54:15.906 --> 54:17.874
That's according to whom?

54:17.941 --> 54:20.307
Me. I saw the whole thing.

54:21.478 --> 54:23.571
You want to testify
before the grand jury?

54:23.647 --> 54:26.946
I've already signed IA's affidavit.
The charges are being dismissed.

54:27.017 --> 54:29.247
Oh, you guys are... you're good.

54:29.319 --> 54:32.288
You know, you're obviously as thick
as thieves in this precinct.

54:32.355 --> 54:34.653
But it'll come back to you.
You know that, right?

54:34.724 --> 54:37.420
I mean, one day someday it will.
It will come back to you.

54:45.635 --> 54:47.603
You understand?

54:47.671 --> 54:49.195
Motherfucker.

54:49.272 --> 54:51.502
Hey, do you understand?

54:54.611 --> 54:56.670
Okay.

55:01.885 --> 55:03.648
Motherfucker.

55:19.002 --> 55:20.993
You're gonna have to tell me
how you got

55:21.071 --> 55:24.370
those bruises on your hand
and your neck.

56:15.592 --> 56:17.685
Rigg! Rigg!

56:39.449 --> 56:42.714
I did it! I won!

56:42.786 --> 56:44.413
What the hell did you do?

56:44.487 --> 56:46.751
I...

56:55.298 --> 56:57.266
What's happening?

57:00.971 --> 57:03.633
The human body is
a fascinating organism.

57:03.707 --> 57:05.937
It can withstand
the most brutal injury...

57:06.977 --> 57:10.071
and yet repair itself miraculously.

57:10.146 --> 57:12.114
But you know this all too well.

57:12.182 --> 57:14.173
How many broken bones
have you suffered

57:14.250 --> 57:16.878
at the hands of your husband?

57:16.953 --> 57:19.683
How many flesh wounds
have you endured?

57:19.756 --> 57:21.018
Help!

57:21.091 --> 57:24.959
With time, the bruises have healed,
but your pain has not.

57:27.864 --> 57:31.960
Today I empower you
to take control of your life.

57:32.035 --> 57:34.094
Can you disconnect
from the one thing

57:34.170 --> 57:36.934
that has brought you and others
so much pain?

57:37.007 --> 57:39.441
With time your wounds will heal.

57:41.211 --> 57:43.202
His, however, will not.

57:47.684 --> 57:50.482
Remove the ties that bind...

57:50.553 --> 57:51.679
Get me out of here!

57:51.755 --> 57:53.985
...or bleed to death
from you inactivity.

57:54.057 --> 57:56.025
The choice is yours.

57:56.092 --> 57:58.822
Okay.
Okay okay!

57:58.895 --> 58:00.226
Here we go.

58:04.200 --> 58:06.725
I'm sorry.

58:10.273 --> 58:13.037
Morgan, Morgan,
what the fuck are you doing?

58:45.442 --> 58:48.673
Help me.
Please help me. I can't do this.

58:48.745 --> 58:50.838
- Please help me!
- Calm down.

58:50.914 --> 58:53.041
No, don't go. Don't go.
Don't go. Wait for me.

58:53.116 --> 58:55.107
Please get me out.
Please get me out.

58:55.185 --> 58:57.779
Don't. Don't go. Don't leave me here.

58:57.854 --> 59:00.755
Help me down.

59:00.824 --> 59:03.793
Hello, Officer Rigg.
What have you learned thus far?

59:03.860 --> 59:06.192
Experience is a harsh teacher.

59:06.262 --> 59:08.253
First comes the test.

59:08.331 --> 59:11.027
Second comes the lesson.

59:11.101 --> 59:13.569
If you are to save as I save

59:13.636 --> 59:16.434
then you will see
that the person before you

59:16.506 --> 59:18.064
is but a student.

59:18.141 --> 59:20.871
So I ask you, Officer Rigg,

59:20.944 --> 59:22.912
has the pupil learned her lesson?

59:22.979 --> 59:26.415
Has she been taught
the error of her ways?

59:26.483 --> 59:28.178
Does she now

59:28.251 --> 59:30.242
- view the world differently?
- Please help.

59:31.488 --> 59:34.719
Officer Rigg,
the key to this person's freedom

59:34.791 --> 59:37.624
lies in the palm of your hand.

59:37.694 --> 59:40.094
But only after she has done
her own part

59:40.163 --> 59:43.690
can you play your role
in her salvation.

59:43.767 --> 59:46.065
Once judgment has been made,
though,

59:46.136 --> 59:48.798
the key to finding
your next destination

59:48.872 --> 59:51.238
is just off the map.

59:51.307 --> 59:54.401
- Who did this to you?
- I don't know.

59:55.979 --> 59:57.742
Help, please.
Help, please.

59:57.814 --> 59:59.941
Stay still.
I'm gonna try to take this out.

01:00:12.162 --> 01:00:13.356
Thank you.
Thank you.

01:00:13.429 --> 01:00:15.397
Oh, fuck.

01:00:16.499 --> 01:00:19.195
That's it.
"Just off the map."

01:00:19.269 --> 01:00:21.237
Just off the map.

01:00:22.505 --> 01:00:25.133
Tracy.

01:00:27.210 --> 01:00:28.541
"Go home."

01:00:31.414 --> 01:00:33.109
Where is she?

01:00:33.183 --> 01:00:35.879
I'm so cold. Please.

01:00:43.193 --> 01:00:45.161
I want to live.

01:00:49.098 --> 01:00:51.066
You have to save yourself.

01:00:55.071 --> 01:00:56.834
Don't leave me.
Please don't leave.

01:00:56.906 --> 01:00:58.931
Help me, please.
Don't leave.

01:01:03.947 --> 01:01:06.040
I want to stop playing.

01:01:09.853 --> 01:01:11.980
Why don't you fucking kill me?

01:01:12.055 --> 01:01:13.886
No.

01:01:16.259 --> 01:01:19.922
- Shut up!
- I don't want to play anymore.

01:01:22.498 --> 01:01:24.466
"Save as I save."

01:01:24.534 --> 01:01:26.661
So what did he do,
free her and let him die?

01:01:26.736 --> 01:01:28.897
This guy didn't have a chance.
He's got rods going through

01:01:28.972 --> 01:01:31.668
every major artery in his body.
"Your life is in her hands."

01:01:31.741 --> 01:01:33.709
Rigg didn't kill this guy.
His wife did.

01:01:33.776 --> 01:01:36.711
She identified Officer Rigg,
said he saved her.

01:01:36.779 --> 01:01:38.440
- Saved?
- Yeah.

01:01:38.514 --> 01:01:41.074
She passed Rigg's judgment,
got fixed and got her freedom back.

01:01:45.421 --> 01:01:47.753
- Yeah.
- Second address?

01:01:50.126 --> 01:01:52.924
Really? Okay, yeah.
That's good. Good.

01:01:52.996 --> 01:01:55.294
But I still need that address.
Text me.

01:01:55.365 --> 01:01:58.596
I just found out something interesting
about the three people in the traps.

01:01:58.668 --> 01:02:02.069
They were all represented by a lawyer
named Art Blank.

01:02:02.138 --> 01:02:04.368
- He got them all off?
- Yeah. But wait, it gets better.

01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:05.873
He's also Jill Tuck's lawyer.

01:02:07.243 --> 01:02:09.143
Look out!

01:02:13.249 --> 01:02:16.309
- The lair... where's the lair?
- Raided. It doesn't exist.

01:02:16.386 --> 01:02:18.946
Jigsaw wanted us to find that place.
Where's the new game being played?

01:02:19.022 --> 01:02:20.455
We find that place... we find Rigg.

01:02:20.523 --> 01:02:22.889
We got a second address.
There's a co-owner.

01:02:22.959 --> 01:02:24.290
- Who?
- Jill Tuck.

01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:27.158
- Jill Tuck? Where's the building?
- Here. This building.

01:03:36.332 --> 01:03:38.061
Hello, Agent Perez.

01:03:38.134 --> 01:03:41.968
And welcome to the world
that you have long studied.

01:03:42.038 --> 01:03:43.869
Your partner Agent Strahm

01:03:43.940 --> 01:03:47.569
will soon take the life
of an innocent man.

01:03:47.643 --> 01:03:50.134
Heed my warning, Agent Perez.

01:03:50.213 --> 01:03:53.376
Your next move is critical.

01:03:53.449 --> 01:03:55.417
Open the door...

01:03:58.187 --> 01:04:00.155
What is that?

01:04:11.768 --> 01:04:13.736
I got you.

01:04:18.107 --> 01:04:19.904
Paramedics!

01:04:19.976 --> 01:04:21.876
Help!

01:04:23.246 --> 01:04:25.578
Stay with me.
Okay, come on.

01:04:25.648 --> 01:04:27.616
Shallow breaths. Come on.

01:04:27.683 --> 01:04:29.207
Stay with me. All right.

01:04:29.285 --> 01:04:31.685
All right. You're gonna be fine.
You're gonna be fine.

01:05:02.985 --> 01:05:04.816
Hey.

01:05:05.855 --> 01:05:07.823
Hey, you. Come here.

01:05:07.890 --> 01:05:09.448
Look.

01:05:09.525 --> 01:05:12.358
Hey. Hey.

01:05:12.428 --> 01:05:14.055
Come on.

01:05:14.130 --> 01:05:16.997
Hey. Hey.

01:05:18.301 --> 01:05:19.734
Fuck.

01:05:24.841 --> 01:05:27.002
- Stop. Stop.
- Son of a bitch!

01:05:27.076 --> 01:05:28.839
Fuck.

01:05:31.547 --> 01:05:33.879
Stop. Fuck.

01:05:33.950 --> 01:05:35.747
Hey.

01:05:35.818 --> 01:05:38.446
Listen to me. I'm not the one
you've got to worry about.

01:05:38.521 --> 01:05:41.319
You understand me? I'm not
the one you've got to worry about,

01:05:41.390 --> 01:05:43.517
asshole.

01:05:43.593 --> 01:05:46.926
As a matter of fact,
I recommend you stay alive

01:05:46.996 --> 01:05:50.488
until the fucking clock
counts down.

01:05:51.667 --> 01:05:55.569
Here's the good news:
If this other guy passes his test,

01:05:55.638 --> 01:05:58.835
the three of us can go free.

01:05:58.908 --> 01:06:00.773
Hey, look at me.

01:06:00.843 --> 01:06:02.674
Look at me.

01:06:02.745 --> 01:06:05.839
If you don't stay on the block,
your partner gets electrocuted.

01:06:05.915 --> 01:06:08.179
Now for my final task.

01:06:10.153 --> 01:06:12.519
There you go.

01:06:13.656 --> 01:06:15.556
Live or die.

01:06:15.625 --> 01:06:17.388
You make the choice.

01:06:18.728 --> 01:06:21.162
Mrs. Perez?

01:06:21.230 --> 01:06:24.927
Hi. This is Peter Strahm.
I work with your daughter Lindsay.

01:06:25.001 --> 01:06:28.027
Yeah.
I have some bad news.

01:07:05.408 --> 01:07:08.434
See that, Jill? That's a federal fucking
indictment. It's got your name on it.

01:07:08.511 --> 01:07:11.605
Wanna put somebody else's name on it?
You start talking to me, okay?

01:07:11.681 --> 01:07:13.376
What's with the doll?
What's with the tricycle?

01:07:13.449 --> 01:07:15.747
Who were John's business associates
before he went insane?

01:07:15.818 --> 01:07:17.911
He wasn't the associate type.

01:07:18.955 --> 01:07:20.889
Where the hell is Art Blank?

01:07:20.957 --> 01:07:23.050
Obstruction of justice.
Aiding and abetting.

01:07:23.125 --> 01:07:25.389
Conspirator to murder.

01:07:25.461 --> 01:07:26.792
Talk to me!

01:07:26.862 --> 01:07:29.888
In 15 minutes, more people
are gonna die, Jill... police officers.

01:07:29.966 --> 01:07:31.729
He's a business partner.
He's a friend.

01:07:31.801 --> 01:07:33.996
He's the accomplice
we have been looking for

01:07:34.070 --> 01:07:35.799
and he is your fucking lawyer.

01:07:38.074 --> 01:07:41.168
You see this?
This is my partner's blood.

01:07:41.244 --> 01:07:43.610
She's fighting for her life right now

01:07:43.679 --> 01:07:46.773
because of your lunatic husband.

01:07:46.849 --> 01:07:49.579
What happened between Jigsaw
and Art Blank?

01:07:49.652 --> 01:07:51.620
John?

01:07:53.889 --> 01:07:55.857
John.

01:07:57.426 --> 01:07:59.394
I guess he's not here either.

01:07:59.462 --> 01:08:02.829
What the fuck is this place, Jill?

01:08:08.604 --> 01:08:10.799
- Don't be mad.
- What?

01:08:14.443 --> 01:08:16.968
Hey, are you all right?

01:08:17.046 --> 01:08:20.913
You weren't returning
my calls, buddy.

01:08:20.983 --> 01:08:24.783
Listen, John, I...

01:08:24.854 --> 01:08:26.822
I'm sorry.
I understand.

01:08:26.889 --> 01:08:29.790
What happened was a tragedy.

01:08:29.859 --> 01:08:32.487
But I gotta tell you...

01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:34.995
listen, John, I gotta tell you,
those buildings we're working on...

01:08:35.064 --> 01:08:37.032
You take 'em.
You give my share to Jill.

01:08:37.099 --> 01:08:40.158
That's not the way it works, John.
You see, we're partners.

01:08:40.236 --> 01:08:42.670
Your designs will make
those buildings special.

01:08:42.738 --> 01:08:45.206
We've got 40 families ready to move in...
40 families, John,

01:08:45.274 --> 01:08:47.469
low-income families.

01:08:47.542 --> 01:08:49.272
You can't just walk away.

01:08:49.345 --> 01:08:51.313
You're their savior, John.

01:08:51.380 --> 01:08:53.439
Get the fuck out of here.

01:08:53.515 --> 01:08:55.711
Who are you talking to like that?
It's me, John.

01:08:55.785 --> 01:08:58.515
- Did you hear what I said?
- Oh, I heard you, John.

01:09:01.991 --> 01:09:03.959
Get the fuck...

01:09:05.961 --> 01:09:07.622
You heard me.

01:09:10.466 --> 01:09:14.162
Okay, John.
You take good care of yourself.

01:09:15.705 --> 01:09:18.229
Gimme a call
when you're feeling better.

01:09:37.059 --> 01:09:38.993
He blamed me.

01:09:39.060 --> 01:09:41.654
I don't think he could
ever forgive me.

01:09:41.731 --> 01:09:44.198
In his mind
our time was over.

01:09:45.468 --> 01:09:47.834
He was diagnosed with cancer
soon after that.

01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:00.612
Did you try to contact him again?

01:10:00.683 --> 01:10:02.378
I tried.

01:10:03.586 --> 01:10:06.054
But a different person
crawled out of the wreckage.

01:10:06.122 --> 01:10:08.454
Someone else survived.

01:10:39.989 --> 01:10:41.820
- I asked you not to come here.
- I need to talk to you.

01:10:41.891 --> 01:10:43.859
John, John,

01:10:43.926 --> 01:10:47.123
look at this.
What is this, hmm?

01:10:47.196 --> 01:10:49.164
Why do you have Cecil's picture?

01:10:49.231 --> 01:10:51.199
What have you done to him?

01:10:51.267 --> 01:10:55.795
I told him not to take life
for granted.

01:10:55.871 --> 01:10:57.839
I want to play a game.

01:10:57.907 --> 01:11:00.933
Your life is a lie.

01:11:01.010 --> 01:11:02.978
Now comes your moment of truth.

01:11:03.045 --> 01:11:05.013
As a drug user and a hustler,

01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:08.413
you've played roulette
with other people's lives.

01:11:08.484 --> 01:11:10.679
Today you play with your own.

01:12:14.450 --> 01:12:16.418
Fuck.

01:12:21.223 --> 01:12:23.248
Fuck!

01:12:28.564 --> 01:12:30.532
Hey, it's you.

01:12:30.599 --> 01:12:32.157
You did this to me.

01:12:32.234 --> 01:12:35.203
No, you did this to yourself.

01:12:36.605 --> 01:12:38.971
Your greed took the life
of an innocent child.

01:12:39.041 --> 01:12:42.067
Could you give me time
to explain, please?

01:12:42.144 --> 01:12:44.738
I can't give you time.
No one can.

01:12:44.813 --> 01:12:46.303
Time's an illusion.

01:12:46.382 --> 01:12:49.613
Look, look, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

01:12:49.685 --> 01:12:51.710
I forgive you, Cecil. I do.

01:12:51.787 --> 01:12:53.584
Addiction has ruined your life.

01:12:53.656 --> 01:12:55.351
I'm bleeding, man.

01:12:55.424 --> 01:12:57.892
Please just let me go.

01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:00.087
I could let you go.

01:13:00.162 --> 01:13:03.063
That wouldn't serve you.

01:13:03.132 --> 01:13:07.159
I'll tell you what I will do, though.
I'll give you a tool

01:13:07.236 --> 01:13:10.205
to reclaim your life,

01:13:10.272 --> 01:13:13.469
to discard the vices that have
so corrupted your soul.

01:13:13.542 --> 01:13:15.510
I don't have a fucking soul.

01:13:15.578 --> 01:13:17.569
Maybe you will in the next life, Cecil.

01:13:17.646 --> 01:13:19.944
You see, things aren't sequential.

01:13:20.015 --> 01:13:22.643
Good doesn't lead to good,
nor bad to bad.

01:13:22.718 --> 01:13:24.413
People steal,
don't get caught,

01:13:24.486 --> 01:13:26.454
live the good life.

01:13:26.522 --> 01:13:28.581
Others lie, cheat

01:13:28.657 --> 01:13:30.591
and get elected.

01:13:30.659 --> 01:13:33.287
Some people stop
to help a stranded motorist

01:13:33.362 --> 01:13:37.059
and get taken out
by a speeding semi.

01:13:37.132 --> 01:13:39.498
There's no accounting for it.

01:13:39.568 --> 01:13:42.833
How you play the cards you're dealt...
that's all that matters.

01:13:42.905 --> 01:13:45.237
Look at me.

01:13:45.307 --> 01:13:47.138
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

01:13:47.209 --> 01:13:49.871
Oh, yeah.

01:13:49.945 --> 01:13:52.072
I understand.

01:13:53.415 --> 01:13:55.315
You're fucking nuts!

01:14:08.797 --> 01:14:11.823
Whoa! What the fuck is that?

01:14:13.268 --> 01:14:15.031
It's the tool...

01:14:15.104 --> 01:14:17.004
the tool that's going to
save your life.

01:14:18.307 --> 01:14:19.899
I want to play a game.

01:14:21.210 --> 01:14:23.735
Your life is a lie, Cecil.

01:14:24.813 --> 01:14:27.043
Now comes your moment of truth.

01:14:27.116 --> 01:14:30.051
As a drug addict and a thief,

01:14:30.119 --> 01:14:32.280
you've preyed on the kindness
of others

01:14:32.354 --> 01:14:34.345
to fuel your addiction.

01:14:34.423 --> 01:14:36.755
Today we're bringing

01:14:36.825 --> 01:14:39.419
the ugliness inside you
out into the open.

01:14:39.495 --> 01:14:41.622
Now in order for you
to stay alive

01:14:41.697 --> 01:14:44.165
we have to match your face

01:14:44.233 --> 01:14:47.031
with the ugliness of your soul.

01:14:48.404 --> 01:14:52.704
Just lean forward into the knives
with your face.

01:14:52.775 --> 01:14:55.005
Press hard enough

01:14:55.077 --> 01:14:58.103
and you'll release
the arm and the leg restraints

01:14:58.180 --> 01:15:00.614
that bind you.

01:15:00.683 --> 01:15:02.674
Press hard, though.

01:15:04.119 --> 01:15:05.848
And you'll be free.

01:15:05.921 --> 01:15:08.651
You sick fuck! Fuck you!

01:15:08.724 --> 01:15:13.661
Or you can sit idly
and bleed out on the floor.

01:15:14.697 --> 01:15:16.995
Live or die, Cecil.

01:15:17.066 --> 01:15:19.034
Make your choice.

01:15:28.944 --> 01:15:31.276
Fuck you, you sick fuck!

01:15:31.346 --> 01:15:32.904
Help!

01:16:24.700 --> 01:16:26.099
You're dead.

01:16:26.168 --> 01:16:28.796
You're fucking dead.

01:16:30.305 --> 01:16:32.432
Fucking dead.

01:16:46.021 --> 01:16:47.989
What's happened to you?

01:16:50.559 --> 01:16:53.027
What's happened to me?

01:16:53.095 --> 01:16:54.926
What's happened
to me?

01:17:03.539 --> 01:17:05.564
Now you don't come back.

01:17:07.142 --> 01:17:09.372
You do it for yourself
if you can't do it for me.

01:17:10.879 --> 01:17:12.847
I lost him too.

01:17:48.684 --> 01:17:51.084
"Four Walls Build a Home."

01:17:59.394 --> 01:18:01.658
Your son was named
after John's first building, right?

01:18:01.730 --> 01:18:04.028
- Yes.
- Where is it?

01:18:04.099 --> 01:18:06.659
Where is it?
Where is it?

01:18:06.735 --> 01:18:09.295
Where is it?

01:18:29.958 --> 01:18:31.482
What the fuck does that mean?

01:19:25.047 --> 01:19:29.108
Fuck. Oh, fuck.

01:19:32.487 --> 01:19:34.648
You'd better hope he doesn't
come through that door.

01:19:34.723 --> 01:19:37.817
Who? Who's coming
through the door?

01:19:42.331 --> 01:19:44.731
Who is it?

01:20:17.599 --> 01:20:19.897
Where the fuck are you?

01:20:19.968 --> 01:20:23.631
Gideon Meat Packing,
11235 Blake Drive.

01:20:23.705 --> 01:20:25.673
I don't have two minutes.

01:21:27.169 --> 01:21:29.603
Who's coming through the door?

01:21:41.016 --> 01:21:42.984
Fuck.

01:22:02.471 --> 01:22:04.564
Congratulations, Art.

01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:40.704
Who is it?

01:22:43.712 --> 01:22:46.203
Who's coming through the door?

01:22:46.281 --> 01:22:48.841
Here he comes.

01:22:48.917 --> 01:22:50.043
Who the fuck is it?

01:22:51.553 --> 01:22:54.386
Shit.

01:22:57.392 --> 01:22:59.189
Shit.

01:23:01.163 --> 01:23:03.563
Fix me, motherfucker!

01:23:06.001 --> 01:23:08.834
I'm standing right here.

01:23:10.105 --> 01:23:12.596
Your time's running out.

01:23:12.674 --> 01:23:14.699
Please think about
what you're doing.

01:23:18.113 --> 01:23:22.106
Think about
what you promised me.

01:23:22.184 --> 01:23:23.651
Think about tomorrow.

01:23:23.718 --> 01:23:25.686
Lynn?

01:23:27.489 --> 01:23:30.458
Lynn! Lynn!

01:23:39.401 --> 01:23:41.369
Who is it?

01:23:50.845 --> 01:23:52.972
What is that?

01:23:53.048 --> 01:23:56.040
This will release us
when the timer's up.

01:24:00.455 --> 01:24:02.821
Release me!

01:24:07.562 --> 01:24:09.530
Which is it gonna be, Jeff?

01:24:09.598 --> 01:24:11.566
Live or die, Jeff.

01:24:11.633 --> 01:24:13.726
You've got a choice.

01:24:13.802 --> 01:24:15.497
I forgive you.

01:24:16.538 --> 01:24:18.506
Jeff.

01:24:18.573 --> 01:24:20.541
Jeff!

01:24:24.846 --> 01:24:26.746
- Eric!
- Don't open the door!

01:24:26.815 --> 01:24:28.680
What the fuck?

01:24:30.952 --> 01:24:32.180
Shit.

01:25:12.327 --> 01:25:14.625
"Open the door and you will find me."

01:25:26.574 --> 01:25:29.372
- Let me see your fucking hands.
- Where is my daughter, you mother...?

01:25:31.746 --> 01:25:32.906
Fuck.

01:25:41.256 --> 01:25:43.383
Jesus.

01:25:54.536 --> 01:25:57.528
- Fuck!
- Aw, you stupid motherfucker.

01:25:57.605 --> 01:25:59.630
- What did you do?
- I had more time.

01:25:59.708 --> 01:26:03.337
- I still had fucking time.
- Why did you open that door?

01:26:03.411 --> 01:26:05.106
- You fucking did this!
- No, you idiot.

01:26:05.180 --> 01:26:09.241
No, Jigsaw's testing you,
you fucking piece of shit.

01:26:09.317 --> 01:26:11.911
Put your fucking hands
where I can see them!

01:26:11.986 --> 01:26:14.250
- Jigsaw's fucking testing you.
- Don't fucking move!

01:26:18.193 --> 01:26:19.990
Hello, Officer Rigg.

01:26:20.061 --> 01:26:22.689
If you are hearing this,
then you have reached

01:26:22.764 --> 01:26:25.562
Detective Matthews
and Detective Hoffman

01:26:25.633 --> 01:26:28.101
in under 90 minutes,

01:26:28.169 --> 01:26:30.262
resulting in their deaths.

01:26:30.338 --> 01:26:32.533
The rules were clear.

01:26:32.607 --> 01:26:34.472
You were warned.

01:26:34.542 --> 01:26:36.271
- It's Kerry!
- Do not go through that door.

01:26:36.344 --> 01:26:39.279
You know never to go
through an unsecured door, ever.

01:26:40.448 --> 01:26:42.780
Tonight you face your obsession.

01:26:42.851 --> 01:26:45.615
What you can't do
is save everyone.

01:26:45.687 --> 01:26:47.712
Will you learn how to let go?

01:26:48.757 --> 01:26:51.317
- Eric is still out there, man.
- It's time to let go.

01:26:51.393 --> 01:26:53.861
Detective Matthews has
but 90 minutes.

01:26:53.928 --> 01:26:56.192
I recommend you stay alive

01:26:56.264 --> 01:26:58.357
until the fucking clock
counts down.

01:26:58.433 --> 01:27:00.424
They had to save themselves.

01:27:01.469 --> 01:27:03.266
Take 'em.

01:27:05.407 --> 01:27:09.036
Their salvation was
out of your hands.

01:27:09.110 --> 01:27:11.078
Time was on your side,

01:27:11.146 --> 01:27:13.842
but your obsession
wouldn't let you wait.

01:27:13.915 --> 01:27:16.782
Instead of saving
Detective Matthews,

01:27:16.851 --> 01:27:18.819
you cost him his life.

01:27:18.887 --> 01:27:21.014
You failed your final test.

01:27:28.763 --> 01:27:31.789
What I don't understand is
how the hell could Jigsaw do all this?

01:27:31.866 --> 01:27:33.800
He was damn near on his deathbed
the last time we saw him.

01:27:33.868 --> 01:27:35.836
I'm not so sure he did.

01:27:42.510 --> 01:27:44.774
- This wasn't done by Amanda Young.
- Excuse me?

01:27:44.846 --> 01:27:46.837
- She couldn't get her up there alone.
- John Kramer was...

01:27:46.915 --> 01:27:48.644
He's brains, not brawn.

01:27:48.716 --> 01:27:51.651
We're here to find the person
helping Jigsaw and Amanda Young.

01:28:01.896 --> 01:28:04.126
Looks like another doctor
went missing from the hospital.

01:28:08.203 --> 01:28:09.465
You go home.

01:28:12.474 --> 01:28:14.066
We chose this.

01:28:31.359 --> 01:28:33.327
Game over.

01:29:01.356 --> 01:29:03.688
<i>You feel you now have control,
don't you?</i>

01:29:05.793 --> 01:29:08.387
<i>You think you will
walk away untested?</i>

01:29:15.737 --> 01:29:19.173
<i>I promise that my work
will continue.</i>

01:29:19.240 --> 01:29:22.368
<i>That I have ensured.</i>

01:29:22.443 --> 01:29:26.643
<i>By hearing this tape
some will assume that this is over.</i>

01:29:26.714 --> 01:29:30.047
<i>But I am still among you.</i>

01:29:30.118 --> 01:29:33.383
<i>You think it's over
just because I am dead?</i>

01:29:33.454 --> 01:29:37.254
<i>It's not over.
The games have just begun.</i>

01:29:38.305 --> 01:29:44.264
