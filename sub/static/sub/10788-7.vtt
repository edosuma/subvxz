WEBVTT

00:03.834 --> 00:05.708
Jen: 15 MORE MINUTES.

00:05.708 --> 00:08.458
Dawson: YEP.

00:08.458 --> 00:12.458
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO STAY WITH ME
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO.

00:12.458 --> 00:14.875
YOU'RE NOT THINKING
ABOUT CHICKENING OUT
AGAIN, ARE YOU?

00:14.875 --> 00:17.792
I DON'T--NO,
I'M NOT THINKING
ABOUT CHICKENING OUT.

00:17.792 --> 00:22.375
I MIGHT DITCH,
BUT THAT'S SOMETHING
DIFFERENT ENTIRELY.

00:22.375 --> 00:25.208
YOU KNOW,
IT'S NOT REALLY SO BAD.

00:25.208 --> 00:27.166
THERAPY?
YEAH.

00:27.166 --> 00:28.500
SO, I JUST TALK, RIGHT?

00:28.500 --> 00:30.000
I GO INTO
A TOTAL STRANGER'S OFFICE,

00:30.000 --> 00:32.500
I TELL THEM
MY DEEPEST FEARS,

00:32.500 --> 00:34.834
AND THIS IS SUPPOSED
TO SOLVE SOMETHING?

00:34.834 --> 00:37.500
NO, NOT NECESSARILY.

00:37.500 --> 00:39.875
FREUD ACTUALLY
CONSIDERED HIMSELF
QUITE LUCKY

00:39.875 --> 00:41.250
IF HE COULD
MANAGE TO CONVERT
HYSTERICAL MISERY

00:41.250 --> 00:44.125
INTO COMMON,
EVERYDAY UNHAPPINESS.

00:44.125 --> 00:46.542
SO, THE GOAL HERE
IS UNHAPPINESS?

00:46.542 --> 00:47.667
EXACTLY.

00:47.667 --> 00:48.625
GREAT.

00:48.625 --> 00:51.542
AW, WHAT DID HE KNOW,
ANYWAY?

00:51.542 --> 00:52.875
ALL THAT CRAP
ABOUT PENIS ENVY

00:52.875 --> 00:53.875
AND OVEREMPHASIS
ON LIBIDO.

00:53.875 --> 00:56.875
I LOVE COLLEGE, JEN.

00:56.875 --> 00:59.000
I FEEL LIKE I'M
IN A FRENCH MOVIE.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.125
[GIGGLES]

01:00.125 --> 01:03.875
REALLY, IT'S NOT SO BAD.
TRUST ME.

01:03.875 --> 01:06.333
90% OF PEOPLE
ON THIS EARTH
COULD BENEFIT

01:06.333 --> 01:10.375
FROM A LITTLE
HONEST-TO-GOODNESS
TIME ON THE COUCH.

01:10.375 --> 01:12.083
YOU ACTUALLY LAID
ON A COUCH?

01:12.083 --> 01:15.208
ONCE, BUT IT WAS NOT
VERY COMFORTABLE.

01:15.208 --> 01:17.000
THE WHOLE
TOM FROST OFFICE...

01:17.000 --> 01:21.208
THEY WERE VERY STARK,
VERY DANISH.

01:21.208 --> 01:23.083
HOWEVER, I PREDICT
THAT THIS RACHEL WEIR
OF YOURS

01:23.083 --> 01:25.667
WILL PROBABLY
BE MUCH WARMER.

01:25.667 --> 01:28.250
I'M SURE SHE'S
LIKE A SPIDER PLANT
IN THE WINDOW

01:28.250 --> 01:29.166
KIND OF CHICK.

01:29.166 --> 01:30.750
YOU NEVER FELT RIDICULOUS

01:30.750 --> 01:33.417
BLATHERING ON
ABOUT YOUR PROBLEMS
TO A TOTAL STRANGER?

01:33.417 --> 01:34.417
NO MORE RIDICULOUS
THAN I FEEL

01:34.417 --> 01:36.959
BLATHERING ON TO NO ONE
ON THE RADIO.

01:36.959 --> 01:37.625
HEY, THAT'S NOT TRUE.
I LISTEN.

01:37.625 --> 01:39.917
YOU AND GRAMS.

01:42.083 --> 01:44.708
THANK YOU FOR
DOING THIS WITH ME.

01:44.708 --> 01:47.333
ANYTIME.

02:42.291 --> 02:43.792
[DOOR OPENS]

02:43.792 --> 02:45.291
Boy: OK, SO JUST--

02:45.291 --> 02:46.125
I GOT IT. LOVE YA.

02:46.125 --> 02:48.417
MEAN IT. REALLY.
SERIOUSLY.

02:48.417 --> 02:50.000
UH, AUDREY, CALL ME
IF YOU NEED ME.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.166
HOW COME YOUR FILM GEEK
LOOKS LIKE TOM CRUISE

02:52.166 --> 02:53.917
AND THE ONE
WHO WORSHIPS ME
LOOKS LIKE THE KID

02:53.917 --> 02:57.000
WHO DOESN'T WANT
TO GO TO THE DANCE
IN SIXTEEN CANDLES?

02:57.000 --> 02:58.875
YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD
BE NICER TO GEORGE.

02:58.875 --> 03:00.542
I'M SURE HE'S GOING
TO BE VERY FAMOUS
SOME DAY.

03:00.542 --> 03:02.834
WHATEVER. ALL I KNOW
IS THAT I PRACTICALLY
HAD TO SLEEP WITH HIM

03:02.834 --> 03:05.959
TO GET HIM TO
LOAN ME HIS DIGITAL
VIDEO CAMERA.

03:05.959 --> 03:08.250
WHAT DO YOU NEED
THAT FOR, ANYWAY?

03:08.250 --> 03:09.500
MY AUDITION TAPE.

03:09.500 --> 03:11.500
REAL WORLD, IBIZA,
HERE I COME.

03:11.500 --> 03:11.875
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

03:11.875 --> 03:13.583
NO.

03:13.583 --> 03:15.333
AND IT'S NOT THAT
I WOULDN'T MISS YOU, JO,

03:15.333 --> 03:17.083
IT'S JUST, WHO WOULDN'T
RATHER WINTER IN SPAIN?

03:17.083 --> 03:19.667
OK. I'M HAVING PROBLEMS
WITH THE TONE OF
THE TAPE, THOUGH.

03:19.667 --> 03:22.500
DO I GO FOR VAMP, VIXEN,
OR ALL-OUT SLUT?

03:22.500 --> 03:24.667
WELL, JUST AS LONG
AS YOU'RE PLANNING

03:24.667 --> 03:26.583
ON REPRESENTING
ALL THE COLORS
OF THE RAINBOW.

03:26.583 --> 03:29.458
WHAT IS ALL THIS STUFF,
ANYWAY?

03:29.458 --> 03:32.834
I'M TRYING TO GET UP TO SPEED
FOR THIS ROSE LAZARE PROJECT.

03:32.834 --> 03:34.041
WE'RE HAVING
ANOTHER MEETING TONIGHT.

03:34.041 --> 03:34.875
OH, SHOULDN'T YOU
BE GETTING READY?

03:34.875 --> 03:36.208
I'M TRYING,
BUT THESE BOOKS--

03:36.208 --> 03:39.875
I MEAN, YOU PRACTICALLY
NEED FOOTNOTES
FOR THE FOOTNOTES.

03:39.875 --> 03:41.542
NOT THAT, YOU FOOL!

03:41.542 --> 03:43.542
WARDROBE!

03:43.542 --> 03:46.792
AUDREY, I REALLY DON'T THINK
ANYONE'S GONNA BE NOTICING
WHAT I'M WEARING.

03:46.792 --> 03:48.000
OK, AND WHERE
WOULD MADONNA BE

03:48.000 --> 03:49.500
IF SHE HAD
THAT ATTITUDE?

03:49.500 --> 03:51.041
I'M SERIOUS HERE.

03:51.041 --> 03:52.500
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THESE MEETINGS
ARE LIKE.

03:52.500 --> 03:55.834
I MEAN, EVERYONE ELSE
IS, LIKE, A JUNIOR
OR SENIOR.

03:55.834 --> 03:58.125
THEY'RE DROPPING NAMES
SO FAST AND FURIOUSLY

03:58.125 --> 04:00.166
THEY'RE PRACTICALLY LEAVING
DENTS IN THE CARPET.

04:00.166 --> 04:03.750
AND THEN WILDER WILL
THROW IN THESE LITTLE
OFF-THE-CUFF EXPLANATIONS

04:03.750 --> 04:04.834
OBVIOUSLY INTENDED FOR ME.

04:04.834 --> 04:06.208
I MEAN, THE GUY KNOWS
I'M AN IDIOT.

04:06.208 --> 04:08.750
WHY WOULD HE EVEN
BOTHER PICKING ME
FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS?

04:08.750 --> 04:10.208
PLEASE.
BECAUSE YOU'RE HOT,

04:10.208 --> 04:13.208
AND HE'S A TEACHER.
AND DON'T TELL ME

04:13.208 --> 04:14.917
YOU DIDN'T CONSIDER THAT
A POSSIBILITY.

04:14.917 --> 04:16.708
I MEAN,
WOULD IT BE SO AWFUL

04:16.708 --> 04:19.125
IF SOME INCREDIBLY
GORGEOUS GUY
FOUND YOU ATTRACTIVE?

04:19.125 --> 04:20.791
WELL, HAS IT EVER
OCCURRED TO YOU

04:20.791 --> 04:22.583
THAT THE GOAL OF
THE COLLEGE EXPERIENCE

04:22.583 --> 04:24.291
IS NOT TO BE REDUCED
TO A PIECE OF MEAT?

04:24.291 --> 04:27.208
OH, SO YOU'D RATHER
BE A BRAIN IN A JAR?

04:27.208 --> 04:28.542
WELL, THEN I WOULDN'T
HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT
WHAT I'M WEARING.

04:31.166 --> 04:31.542
DEFINITELY THIS.

04:38.417 --> 04:42.083
SO, HOW MANY PEOPLE
ARE ACTUALLY COMING
TO THIS ANNIVERSARY THING?

04:42.083 --> 04:43.417
MAYBE 300,
ALMOST ALL OF WHOM

04:43.417 --> 04:46.000
WILL BE EATING YOUR
MUSHROOM-DUCK CREPES,

04:46.000 --> 04:49.583
WHICH YOU HAVE
APPROXIMATELY 39 HOURS
LEFT TO PERFECT.

04:49.583 --> 04:50.583
AND THESE ARE FRIENDS.

04:50.583 --> 04:53.458
FRIENDS...BACKERS,
PATRONS, REVIEWERS,

04:53.458 --> 04:56.166
WHO ARE ALL HAPPY
TO KEEP BEING OUR FRIENDS

04:56.166 --> 04:57.750
SO LONG AS THEY'RE
KEPT HAPPY.

04:57.750 --> 04:58.834
ROB CALLED.

04:58.834 --> 05:00.458
AND WHAT DID YOUNG ROB
HAVE TO SAY FOR HIMSELF?

05:00.458 --> 05:01.792
HE CALLED TO CONFIRM
THE WHITE ASPARAGUS

05:01.792 --> 05:02.875
SHOULD BE HERE
TOMORROW MORNING.

05:02.875 --> 05:04.125
THIS IS TOO EARLY.

05:04.125 --> 05:04.875
LOOK, YOU'VE GOTTA WAIT
FOR THE SAUCE TO CARAMELIZE.

05:04.875 --> 05:06.792
TRY IT AGAIN.

05:06.792 --> 05:08.291
HE ALSO SAID
CONGRATULATIONS.

05:08.291 --> 05:09.792
THAT MEANS A LOT.

05:09.792 --> 05:11.291
ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING
THAT LAST YEAR

05:11.291 --> 05:13.792
HE DEMANDED CASH
FOR EVERY DELIVERY

05:13.792 --> 05:15.583
AND KEPT SENDING US
THE WILTED LETTUCE.

05:15.583 --> 05:17.041
I KNOW. AND YOU
SLEPT HERE EVERY NIGHT

05:17.041 --> 05:18.166
TO WAIT
FOR THE DELIVERIES.

05:18.166 --> 05:20.000
WELL, I HAD TO BE THERE
IN ENOUGH TIME

05:20.000 --> 05:20.708
SO THAT THEY COULD
UNPACK THE STUFF

05:20.708 --> 05:22.333
AND THEN REPACK IT AGAIN.

05:22.333 --> 05:23.625
ROB HATED YOU FOR THAT.

05:23.625 --> 05:26.333
HE DID. HOWEVER,
HE STARTED SENDING US
THE FRESH STUFF.

05:26.333 --> 05:27.750
SO, YOU WERE ACTUALLY
THE SECOND CHEF HERE.

05:27.750 --> 05:31.834
YEP. THEY HIRED ME
AFTER THE FIRST ONE'S
COKE HABIT

05:31.834 --> 05:32.708
BECAME A BIT TOO HABITUAL.

05:32.708 --> 05:34.166
AND YOU REALLY
USED TO LIVE HERE?

05:34.166 --> 05:35.500
FOR MONTHS AT A TIME.

05:35.500 --> 05:38.625
THAT HAS GOT TO BE
HELL ON A MARRIAGE.

05:38.625 --> 05:41.250
HEY, SPEAKING OF,
IS EMILY GONNA
BE HERE TOMORROW?

05:41.250 --> 05:44.667
NO.
SHE CAN'T MAKE IT.

06:03.417 --> 06:05.333
SOMETHING FUNNY?

06:05.333 --> 06:08.375
NO, I--IT'S
A LONG STORY.

06:08.375 --> 06:10.542
LONGER THAN
50 MINUTES?

06:10.542 --> 06:15.000
NO, IT'S JUST,
MY FRIEND JEN
AND I WERE

06:15.000 --> 06:16.291
TRYING TO GUESS
WHAT YOU'D BE LIKE,

06:16.291 --> 06:18.750
AND SHE...

06:18.750 --> 06:21.000
RIGHT. RIGHT.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.583
I USED TO HAVE
PLASTIC ONES,

06:22.583 --> 06:23.708
BUT I GOT RID
OF 'EM.

06:23.708 --> 06:25.708
MAKES THE PATIENTS
NERVOUS.

06:25.708 --> 06:26.792
NO ONE WANTS
A THERAPIST

06:26.792 --> 06:28.083
THAT CAN'T EVEN
KEEP A PLANT ALIVE.

06:28.083 --> 06:29.041
RIGHT.

06:29.041 --> 06:31.625
SO, WHAT ELSE
DID YOU EXPECT?

06:31.625 --> 06:33.542
I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT ANYBODY EXPECTS.

06:33.542 --> 06:35.583
ROBIN WILLIAMS
IN GOOD WILL HUNTING?

06:35.583 --> 06:39.458
OR JUDD HIRSCH
IN A BIG SWEATER?

06:40.875 --> 06:42.542
DO YOU WANT TO, LIKE,
START OVER OR SOMETHING?

06:42.542 --> 06:44.458
I WANT TO DO THIS RIGHT.

06:44.458 --> 06:46.417
YOU ARE DOING IT RIGHT.

06:46.417 --> 06:50.542
SO, UH, I GUESS YOU KNOW
WHY I'M HERE.

06:50.542 --> 06:53.875
I WOULD KINDA LIKE
TO HEAR THAT FROM YOU,
IF I COULD.

06:53.875 --> 06:56.083
I'VE BEEN HAVING
THESE ATTACKS.

06:56.083 --> 06:58.875
PANIC ATTACKS?

06:58.875 --> 07:00.083
YEAH.

07:00.083 --> 07:01.250
AND I KNOW THEY'RE
MY WAY OF DEALING

07:01.250 --> 07:03.834
WITH MY FATHER'S DEATH.

07:03.834 --> 07:06.291
AND YOU'RE SURE
ABOUT THAT?

07:06.291 --> 07:07.875
WELL, I MEAN,
NOTHING ELSE IS REALLY

07:07.875 --> 07:09.708
ALL THAT DIFFERENT
IN MY LIFE RIGHT NOW.

07:09.708 --> 07:10.959
NOTHING ELSE?

07:12.708 --> 07:14.166
I GUESS THAT'S
NOT REALLY TRUE, IS IT?

07:14.166 --> 07:17.208
DID IT FEEL TRUE?

07:17.208 --> 07:20.000
WELL, 6 MONTHS AGO,

07:20.000 --> 07:24.166
THIS IS NOT WHAT I THOUGHT
I'D BE DOING WITH MY LIFE.

07:24.166 --> 07:26.583
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

07:26.583 --> 07:28.750
NOTHING.

07:29.917 --> 07:31.458
I MEAN, I'M HELPING
MY MOM, I GUESS.

07:31.458 --> 07:33.458
AND YOU'RE NOT
IN SCHOOL?

07:33.458 --> 07:36.417
NO. I WAS...AT USC.

07:36.417 --> 07:39.667
THAT'S A GOOD SCHOOL.
IT'S FAR AWAY.

07:39.667 --> 07:41.500
YEAH.

07:41.500 --> 07:43.375
I'M THINKING
ABOUT GOING BACK.
I MEAN, NOT NOW.

07:43.375 --> 07:45.583
OBVIOUSLY, I MEAN,
MY MOM STILL NEEDS ME.

07:45.583 --> 07:47.458
I'VE GOT A BABY SISTER
WHO'S NOT EVEN ONE.

07:47.458 --> 07:50.208
BUT NEXT SEMESTER,
MAYBE?

07:50.208 --> 07:54.250
YEAH, I'VE BEEN--

07:54.250 --> 07:55.583
I'VE BEEN MEANING TO--

07:55.583 --> 07:57.083
TO CALL THEM AND FIND OUT
ABOUT THAT.

07:57.083 --> 07:59.291
IS THIS SOMETHING
THAT YOU WANT TO DO?

07:59.291 --> 08:00.208
I DON'T KNOW.

08:00.208 --> 08:01.792
MAYBE THAT'S
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME.

08:01.792 --> 08:05.583
I DON'T--I DON'T REALLY
DO ANYTHING.

08:05.583 --> 08:07.792
I THINK I'M FROZEN
BETWEEN THE PAST
AND THE FUTURE.

08:07.792 --> 08:08.625
I MEAN, THERE'S NO REASON
I COULDN'T GO BACK.

08:08.625 --> 08:10.500
EXCEPT FOR
THE PANIC ATTACKS...

08:10.500 --> 08:13.500
AND YOUR MOM,
WHO OBVIOUSLY NEEDS YOU,

08:13.500 --> 08:15.125
AND YOUR BABY SISTER.

08:15.125 --> 08:17.792
RIGHT.

08:17.792 --> 08:19.041
I GUESS--

08:19.041 --> 08:21.917
I GUESS THAT WASN'T
ALL THAT TRUE EITHER,
WAS IT?

08:21.917 --> 08:26.208
WELL, THE BRAIN WORKS
IN MYSTERIOUS WAYS.

08:26.208 --> 08:28.083
SO, AM I JUST LYING
TO MYSELF?

08:28.083 --> 08:33.125
DAWSON, LOSING SOMEONE
YOU LOVE--

08:33.125 --> 08:36.166
LOSING THEM SUDDENLY,
WITH NO LOGICAL
EXPLANATION--

08:36.166 --> 08:40.667
THE BRAIN ISN'T SET UP
TO COPE WITH SOMETHING
LIKE THAT.

08:40.667 --> 08:43.291
AND ALONG THE WAY,

08:43.291 --> 08:45.959
A FEW LIES HERE
AND THERE...

08:45.959 --> 08:47.625
IT'S PROBABLY PAR
FOR THE COURSE.

08:47.625 --> 08:49.708
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS

08:49.708 --> 08:51.708
WHEN YOU START
CONVINCING YOURSELF

08:51.708 --> 08:53.625
THAT THE LIES ARE TRUE.

08:59.375 --> 09:00.667
IF YOU ASK ME,

09:00.667 --> 09:02.542
I THINK THIS WHOLE THING
MUST BE EVIDENCE

09:02.542 --> 09:05.625
OF SOME BIG
LESBIAN AFFAIR.

09:05.625 --> 09:08.000
THAT'S WHY THE HUSBAND
NEVER SHOWED ANYBODY
THESE LETTERS

09:08.000 --> 09:09.250
DURING HER LIFETIME.

09:09.250 --> 09:12.708
AND IT WOULD EXPLAIN
ALL THE REFERENCES
TO SAPPHO.

09:12.708 --> 09:13.708
YOU KNOW, ALAN, JUST
BECAUSE A TEENAGE GIRL

09:13.708 --> 09:16.417
HAPPENS TO APPRECIATE
THE LYRIC POETRY

09:16.417 --> 09:18.708
OF THE ANCIENT WORLD'S
MOST FAMOUS LESBIAN,

09:18.708 --> 09:21.417
DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN
SHE WANTS TO SLEEP

09:21.417 --> 09:22.834
WITH OTHER
TEENAGE GIRLS.

09:22.834 --> 09:24.333
YEAH, BUT ROSE DID.

09:24.333 --> 09:25.542
AS LITERARY SLUTS GO,

09:25.542 --> 09:28.875
SHE WAS RIGHT UP THERE WITH
EDNA ST. VINCENT MILLAY

09:28.875 --> 09:30.208
AND ANAIS NIN.

09:30.208 --> 09:32.542
OK, BEFORE CASSANDRA
DROPS ANYMORE NAMES
ON US,

09:32.542 --> 09:35.792
UH, JOEY, ANY THOUGHTS
ON WHAT MAKES

09:35.792 --> 09:37.625
THESE PARTICULAR
ROSE LAZARE LETTERS

09:37.625 --> 09:39.500
SO DIFFERENT
FROM THE HUNDREDS
OF OTHERS

09:39.500 --> 09:41.708
WE'VE BEEN
SLOUGHING THROUGH?

09:41.708 --> 09:43.625
UH...

09:47.417 --> 09:50.708
WELL, FOR STARTERS,
THEY'RE INTERESTING.

09:53.291 --> 09:55.250
AND THIS MAY SOUND
LIKE A STUPID QUESTION,

09:55.250 --> 09:58.583
BUT WHO'S I.V.?

09:58.583 --> 10:00.041
THAT IS A FAR
FROM STUPID QUESTION.

10:00.041 --> 10:02.333
IN FACT,
THAT IS THE QUESTION.

10:02.333 --> 10:04.417
I.V. "I" PERIOD,
"V" PERIOD.

10:04.417 --> 10:05.291
THE PERSON TO WHOM
ALL THESE LETTERS
ARE WRITTEN

10:05.291 --> 10:07.417
COULD BE ANYBODY.

10:07.417 --> 10:09.500
SHE NEVER USES
A FULL NAME?

10:09.500 --> 10:11.166
NOT WITHIN
THE LETTERS THEMSELVES.

10:11.166 --> 10:12.000
WHAT ABOUT THE ENVELOPES?

10:12.000 --> 10:13.750
SHE COULD HAVE
DESTROYED THEM,

10:13.750 --> 10:15.250
THINKING
THAT THE LETTERS
WERE STILL INSIDE,

10:15.250 --> 10:17.917
OR THEY ALL POSSIBLY
MAY BE IN A SHOEBOX

10:17.917 --> 10:19.792
STUFFED UNDER A BED
IN NEW JERSEY.

10:19.792 --> 10:20.500
SO, ESSENTIALLY,
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS

10:20.500 --> 10:22.667
WE HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA

10:22.667 --> 10:25.041
WHO THESE LETTERS
WERE WRITTEN TO.

10:25.041 --> 10:26.083
NONE.

10:26.083 --> 10:29.000
ALL THAT WE KNOW
ARE THAT THESE

10:29.000 --> 10:31.583
ARE THE MOST INTIMATE,
MOST REVEALING LETTERS
OF HER CAREER.

10:31.583 --> 10:32.792
FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN THESE LETTERS,

10:32.792 --> 10:35.583
WE CATCH A GLIMPSE
OF SOMEBODY WHO IS REAL.

10:35.583 --> 10:36.875
SOMEBODY WHO
DOUBTS THEMSELF.

10:36.875 --> 10:39.458
SOMEBODY WHO IS NOT
AFRAID OF LOOKING STUPID

10:39.458 --> 10:43.500
WHILE ASKING
ESSENTIAL QUESTIONS
ABOUT LIFE.

10:43.500 --> 10:45.959
AND ROSE OBVIOUSLY
WROTE THEM TO SOMEBODY

10:45.959 --> 10:46.834
THAT SHE
CARED A LOT ABOUT.

10:46.834 --> 10:48.291
OTHER THAN THAT,
WE KNOW NOTHING.

10:48.291 --> 10:50.917
SO, IT'S A MYSTERY.

10:50.917 --> 10:55.792
COOL. LIKE DERRIDA'S
POST CARD  FOR REAL.

10:55.792 --> 10:57.291
DON'T YOU THINK, JOEY?

10:57.291 --> 10:59.708
UM, I PROBABLY WOULD

10:59.708 --> 11:00.834
IF I HAD ANY IDEA
WHO YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT.

11:03.625 --> 11:06.583
OK. I THINK
THAT'S A GOOD NOTE
TO END ON.

11:06.583 --> 11:11.083
UM, SO NEXT TIME,
I WANT YOU ALL
TO HAVE IDEAS

11:11.083 --> 11:12.834
ON WHO THIS MYSTERY
PERSON COULD BE.

11:12.834 --> 11:15.333
MANY, MANY IDEAS.

11:15.333 --> 11:15.792
TILL THEN.

11:21.083 --> 11:23.291
SO, YOU GOT A DATE
FOR WEDNESDAY?

11:23.291 --> 11:26.834
NOPE.

11:26.834 --> 11:29.667
WHAT HAPPENED
TO THAT BLOND GIRL
I USED TO SEE YOU WITH?

11:29.667 --> 11:30.500
MELISSA?

11:30.500 --> 11:32.166
MALANIE.
RIGHT.

11:32.166 --> 11:35.000
SHE'S A LAW STUDENT.
THAT TENDS TO TAKE UP
A LOT OF YOUR TIME.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.917
THAT'S TOO BAD.
YOU WITH A LAW STUDENT.

11:38.917 --> 11:41.166
PROBABLY COULD HAVE
COME IN HANDY SOME DAY.

11:43.125 --> 11:44.583
SO, LISTEN,

11:44.583 --> 11:46.166
YOU WANT ME TO
SET YOU UP WITH ONE
OF MY FRIENDS?

11:46.166 --> 11:48.083
NO.

11:48.083 --> 11:50.417
WHY NOT? I'VE GOT
SOME HOT FRIENDS.

11:50.417 --> 11:53.542
I SAID NO, OK?

11:53.542 --> 11:55.000
HEY, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
WITH PACEY?

11:55.000 --> 11:57.041
HE USED TO BE
SUCH A LOVABLE GALUMPH.

11:57.041 --> 11:59.458
WELL, HE'S A LITTLE
FED UP RIGHT NOW.

11:59.458 --> 12:02.542
YEAH, ABOUT WHAT?

12:02.542 --> 12:05.625
BELIEVE ME,
YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW.

12:05.625 --> 12:07.041
MAYBE I DO.

12:10.166 --> 12:12.708
OK. YOU KNOW
THAT BOYFRIEND OF YOURS?

12:12.708 --> 12:14.166
THE ONE I'VE BEEN
HEARING SO MUCH ABOUT?

12:14.166 --> 12:16.417
HE WOULDN'T BY ANY CHANCE
BE COMING TOMORROW NIGHT,
WOULD HE?

12:16.417 --> 12:18.542
NO, NOT EXACTLY.

12:18.542 --> 12:20.208
YOU SEE, NOW HERE
IT'S BEEN MONTHS,

12:20.208 --> 12:21.875
AND I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY
SEEN THE GUY.

12:21.875 --> 12:23.375
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

12:23.375 --> 12:24.750
WELL, IT'S LIKE I SAID,

12:24.750 --> 12:27.708
HE'S GOT A REALLY
CRAZY SCHEDULE.

12:27.708 --> 12:31.417
HMM. AND WHEN HE'S NOT
STANDING YOU UP,

12:31.417 --> 12:32.917
DOES HE EVER TAKE YOU
ANYPLACE SPECIAL?

12:32.917 --> 12:37.458
I DON'T KNOW,
MAYBE BOSTON HARBOR,
A GIGANTIC SAILBOAT?

12:39.500 --> 12:42.375
SO, WHAT?
HE TOLD YOU?

12:42.375 --> 12:45.542
NO, HE DIDN'T TELL ME.
IT'S MY BOAT.

12:47.750 --> 12:49.750
ALL THIS TIME YOU'VE
BEEN COMPLAINING TO ME

12:49.750 --> 12:50.792
ABOUT YOUR BOYFRIEND,

12:50.792 --> 12:52.708
AND HERE I'VE
BEEN STUPID ENOUGH

12:52.708 --> 12:54.125
TO ACTUALLY
HAVE SYMPATHY FOR YOU.

12:54.125 --> 12:55.750
I NEVER ASKED YOU
TO HAVE SYMPATHY FOR ME.

12:55.750 --> 12:56.917
YOU DIDN'T ASK ME
TO HAVE SYMPATHY,

12:56.917 --> 12:59.750
AND BELIEVE ME,
I'VE BEEN TRYING NOT TO.

12:59.750 --> 13:02.250
SO, WHAT, YOU'RE JUST
GONNA LAY YOUR LITTLE
GUILT TRIP ON ME NOW?

13:02.250 --> 13:03.250
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT MY LIFE, PACEY.

13:03.250 --> 13:06.333
WHAT I KNOW IS THAT
THIS RELATIONSHIP

13:06.333 --> 13:08.250
IS GOING TO BRING YOU
NOTHING BUT GRIEF.

13:08.250 --> 13:11.667
AND I ALSO KNOW
THAT I HAD TO LOOK
HIS WIFE IN THE EYES

13:11.667 --> 13:15.291
AND LIE FOR YOU.

13:15.291 --> 13:17.792
BELIEVE ME, THAT WAS NOT
TOO ENJOYABLE.

13:17.792 --> 13:20.417
YEAH. WELL, YOU KNOW,
IN THE REAL WORLD,

13:20.417 --> 13:21.708
SOMETIMES PEOPLE
ACTUALLY HAVE
TO DO THINGS

13:21.708 --> 13:24.291
THAT ARE NOT
SO ENJOYABLE
AND ACCEPT THINGS

13:24.291 --> 13:25.792
THAT ARE A LITTLE
LESS THAN PERFECT,

13:25.792 --> 13:27.917
AND COMPROMISE
FOR REASONS
THAT SOMETIMES

13:27.917 --> 13:29.208
PEOPLE ARE TOO IMMATURE
TO COMPREHEND.

13:29.208 --> 13:31.959
IN WHICH CASE,
THEY SHOULD JUST
STAY THE HELL OUT OF IT.

13:40.834 --> 13:44.792
SO, UH, HOW WAS
YOUR THERAPY?

13:44.792 --> 13:46.625
IT WAS FINE.

13:46.625 --> 13:49.083
DID SHE HAVE AN OPINION
ABOUT USC?

13:49.083 --> 13:51.041
NOT REALLY.

13:51.041 --> 13:52.333
WELL, YOU KNOW, DAWSON,

13:52.333 --> 13:53.959
EVENTUALLY THINGS
ARE GONNA HAVE TO START

13:53.959 --> 13:55.166
GETTING BACK TO NORMAL
AROUND HERE.

13:57.458 --> 14:00.083
WERE THINGS EVER NORMAL
AROUND HERE?

14:01.667 --> 14:05.417
AH. HERE WE GO.

14:07.375 --> 14:10.333
THIS LAST ITEM
IS THE LIVING TRUST.

14:10.333 --> 14:14.041
AS YOU KNOW,
THE TRUST PROVIDES MONEY
FOR HEALTH CARE,

14:14.041 --> 14:17.667
EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE,
FINANCIAL SUPPORT.

14:17.667 --> 14:19.750
YOU AND DAWSON ARE
THE LISTED RECIPIENTS.

14:19.750 --> 14:21.542
BUT NOT LILY?

14:21.542 --> 14:23.959
TO MY KNOWLEDGE,
MITCH NEVER FILED
A CODICIL

14:23.959 --> 14:25.500
INCLUDING HER
IN THE TRUST,

14:25.500 --> 14:30.500
WHICH MEANS THAT
TECHNICALLY SHE WON'T
HAVE ACCESS TO IT,

14:30.500 --> 14:33.208
WHICH ISN'T NECESSARILY
A CONCERN RIGHT NOW.

14:33.208 --> 14:35.291
THERE ARE WAYS THAT
WE CAN WORK AROUND THAT,

14:35.291 --> 14:36.583
PERFECTLY LEGAL WAYS.

14:36.583 --> 14:38.959
BUT THAT'S NOT IDEAL?
NO.

14:38.959 --> 14:41.959
I WOULD TAKE A LOOK
AROUND FOR IT. I MEAN,

14:41.959 --> 14:43.834
YOU NEVER KNOW
WHERE THESE THINGS
CAN TURN UP.

14:43.834 --> 14:47.375
A FOLDER, AN ENVELOPE,
THE BACK OF A DRAWER.

14:47.375 --> 14:49.875
WELL, WE'LL CERTAINLY
LOOK FOR IT.

14:49.875 --> 14:50.917
AND THANK YOU.

14:50.917 --> 14:53.250
WELL, GOOD LUCK.

14:53.250 --> 14:55.041
THANKS.

15:03.917 --> 15:05.542
SO, I TAKE IT
YOU'VE BEEN FINDING

15:05.542 --> 15:09.834
OUR LITTLE ROSE LAZARE
PROJECT SOMEWHAT
SNOOZE-INDUCING.

15:09.834 --> 15:11.875
WELL, I WOULDN'T
GO THAT FAR.

15:11.875 --> 15:13.625
BUT YOU HAVE IMPLIED
THAT MOST OF
ROSE'S LETTERS

15:13.625 --> 15:15.708
WERE UNINTERESTING.

15:15.708 --> 15:17.875
WELL, IT'S JUST THAT,

15:17.875 --> 15:19.083
YOU KNOW,
UP UNTIL THIS POINT

15:19.083 --> 15:21.333
THEY'VE ALL BEEN
SO STIFF AND FORMAL,

15:21.333 --> 15:22.750
AS IF SHE'S
WRITING TO SOMEONE

15:22.750 --> 15:23.792
WHO'S GRADING HER
OR SOMETHING.

15:23.792 --> 15:25.583
PEOPLE CAN'T BE AT EASE
WITH OTHER PEOPLE

15:25.583 --> 15:27.583
WHO ARE GIVING THEM
GRADES?

15:27.583 --> 15:30.667
NO. OR AT LEAST
THEY SHOULDN'T BE.

15:30.667 --> 15:32.166
GOOD POINT.

15:32.166 --> 15:33.875
SO, YOU DON'T THINK
SHE COULD HAVE
WRITTEN THEM

15:33.875 --> 15:35.583
TO A TEACHER, SAY,
OR A MENTOR.

15:35.583 --> 15:39.250
KEEP IN MIND
THAT SHE WAS QUITE YOUNG
WHEN SHE WROTE THESE.

15:39.250 --> 15:41.333
AROUND 18 OR 19,
I THINK.

15:42.750 --> 15:43.750
I DON'T KNOW.

15:43.750 --> 15:45.708
I THINK
THEY WERE WRITTEN
TO A FRIEND.

15:45.708 --> 15:48.083
INTERESTING. SO YOU'RE
NOT BUYING CASSANDRA'S

15:48.083 --> 15:51.333
TORRID LESBIAN
LOVE AFFAIR THEORY?

15:51.333 --> 15:54.375
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

15:54.375 --> 15:57.083
IT'S JUST THAT
IF THEY WERE LOVE LETTERS,
WOULDN'T SHE BE--

15:57.083 --> 16:00.458
WHAT, BE MORE OBVIOUS
ABOUT IT?

16:00.458 --> 16:02.959
NOT IF SHE WAS WRITING
TO ANOTHER WOMAN
BACK IN THE TWENTIES.

16:02.959 --> 16:04.125
NO, THAT'S NOT
WHAT I MEANT.

16:04.125 --> 16:06.792
I MEAN, IF THEY WERE
LOVE LETTERS,

16:06.792 --> 16:08.083
WOULDN'T SHE BE
LESS HONEST?

16:08.083 --> 16:09.834
THERE'S A PARADOX
IN THERE SOMEWHERE.

16:09.834 --> 16:12.792
I READ ALL OF THEM
LAST NIGHT,

16:12.792 --> 16:14.500
AND ROSE TOTALLY
POURS HER HEART OUT
INTO THESE LETTERS.

16:14.500 --> 16:18.458
AND WHO IS THAT HONEST
WITH SOMEONE THEY'RE
SEXUALLY ATTRACTED TO?

16:18.458 --> 16:20.750
PEOPLE CAN BE FRIENDS,
RIGHT, BEST FRIENDS,

16:20.750 --> 16:21.959
BUT THE SECOND
SEXUAL ATTRACTION
COMES INTO IT,

16:21.959 --> 16:24.625
IT'S LIKE
ALL BETS ARE OFF

16:24.625 --> 16:27.125
AS FAR AS HONESTY
IS CONCERNED.

16:27.125 --> 16:31.875
SO, YOU DON'T THINK
PEOPLE CAN BE BOTH
FRIENDS AND LOVERS?

16:31.875 --> 16:35.166
I DO.
I HOPE I DO, BUT...

16:37.458 --> 16:40.333
NOT AT 18.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.000
WELL, THEN I THINK
YOU BETTER CONCENTRATE
ON THIS FRIEND ANGLE.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.625
YOU KNOW, I WOULD,
BUT TO BE HONEST,

16:45.625 --> 16:46.708
I DON'T HAVE
THE SAME BACKGROUND

16:46.708 --> 16:48.000
AS EVERYBODY ELSE.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.542
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHERE TO START.

16:50.542 --> 16:52.083
SURE YOU DO.

16:52.083 --> 16:56.500
WHERE DO MOST PEOPLE
MAKE THEIR MOST LASTING
FRIENDSHIPS?

16:56.500 --> 16:57.667
AND DON'T SAY
HIGH SCHOOL.

16:57.667 --> 17:01.000
COLLEGE.
EXACTLY.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.666
AND WHICH PROGRESSIVE,
IF OVERPRICED,
LIBERAL ARTS COLLEGE

17:04.666 --> 17:05.666
DID ROSE LAZARE
HAPPEN TO GO TO?

17:05.666 --> 17:08.333
THIS ONE.

17:08.333 --> 17:11.165
WHICH MEANS
HER FRIENDS...

17:11.165 --> 17:12.333
PROBABLY WENT HER, TOO.

17:14.583 --> 17:16.165
WHY ARE YOU HELPING ME?

17:16.165 --> 17:19.791
LET'S JUST SAY
I LIKE UNDERDOGS.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.917
HONEY?

17:51.917 --> 17:53.750
YOU DON'T THINK IT COULD
BE AT THE RESTAURANT, DO YOU?

17:53.750 --> 17:55.250
LIKE, IN A DRAWER SOMEWHERE
IN THE OFFICE?

17:55.250 --> 17:57.708
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
GOING TO STOP LOOKING.

17:57.708 --> 17:59.834
YEAH, SO DID I,
BUT I CAN'T.

17:59.834 --> 18:02.041
BUT YOU HEARD
WHAT MR. BREZNY SAID,
DIDN'T YOU?

18:02.041 --> 18:03.417
IT'S A TECHNICALITY.
IT DOESN'T MATTER,
HONEY.

18:03.417 --> 18:04.792
EVERYTHING IS GOING
TO BE FINE.

18:04.792 --> 18:06.041
WELL, IT'D BE BETTER
IF WE COULD FIND IT.

18:06.041 --> 18:07.083
I MEAN, IT'S GOTTA
BE HERE SOMEWHERE.

18:07.083 --> 18:09.166
DAWSON, STOP.
WHY?

18:09.166 --> 18:11.125
BECAUSE YOU'RE
SCARING ME A LITTLE.

18:14.417 --> 18:16.959
YOU FOUND IT, DIDN'T YOU?

18:16.959 --> 18:20.375
PAGE 63 OF THE STEPHEN KING
NOVEL ON HIS NIGHT STAND.

18:21.750 --> 18:23.375
AND IT'S NOT SIGNED.

18:24.291 --> 18:26.500
I NEVER THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE.

18:27.959 --> 18:29.375
HONEY, YOUR FATHER
WAS A LOT OF THINGS,

18:29.375 --> 18:33.291
BUT HE, UH,
WASN'T GOOD WITH DETAILS.

18:58.375 --> 19:00.166
HI.

19:00.166 --> 19:01.667
OH, HI.

19:01.667 --> 19:02.959
CAN I?

19:02.959 --> 19:04.166
SURE.

19:04.166 --> 19:05.834
THANKS.

19:05.834 --> 19:07.708
DON'T TELL ME
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THIS?

19:07.708 --> 19:10.166
YEAH.

19:11.708 --> 19:13.750
SO, GOT ANY THEORIES YET?

19:13.750 --> 19:16.792
WELL, I WAS LOOKING
INTO HER ROOMMATE,
SHIRLEY BROWN.

19:16.792 --> 19:18.458
THEY CAUGHT
THE CHICKEN POX
TOGETHER.

19:18.458 --> 19:20.041
YEAH, BUT THAT'S DOUBTFUL.

19:20.041 --> 19:23.458
ROSE MENTIONS HER LATER
IN HER LETTERS TO LOLA MURRAY.

19:23.458 --> 19:24.166
CALLS HER SMALL-MINDED.

19:24.166 --> 19:27.166
AND WOULD YOU BEAR YOUR SOUL

19:27.166 --> 19:29.208
TO SOMEONE YOU THOUGHT
WAS SMALL-MINDED

19:30.917 --> 19:32.125
I GUESS NOT.

19:32.125 --> 19:33.333
BUT THE WHOLE
COLLEGE FRIENDS THING,

19:33.333 --> 19:34.834
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

19:34.834 --> 19:36.500
I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE BOTH HAD IT.

19:36.500 --> 19:40.458
BUT IT'S OK. I MEAN,
THIS WHOLE THING
IS JUST AN EXCUSE

19:40.458 --> 19:42.291
TO BE AROUND
PROFESSOR WILDER
ANYWAY, RIGHT?

19:44.500 --> 19:46.792
YOU CAN HAVE THE YEARBOOK
IF YOU WANT IT.

19:47.708 --> 19:49.959
THANKS.

19:56.500 --> 19:58.291
HEY.

20:00.125 --> 20:01.625
WITTER.

20:01.625 --> 20:03.625
TORRES.

20:03.625 --> 20:09.125
I THOUGHT I MIGHT APOLOGIZE
FOR THE STUFF I SAID.

20:10.667 --> 20:11.959
WHAT STUFF YOU SAID?

20:11.959 --> 20:14.875
YOU KNOW WHAT STUFF.

20:14.875 --> 20:20.375
WELL, IT'S OK
'CAUSE I WASN'T EXACTLY
PRINCE CHARMING, EITHER.

20:20.375 --> 20:25.250
NO, BUT YOU GOT
PUT IN THE MIDDLE
OF SOMETHING, PACEY,

20:25.250 --> 20:26.542
WHICH WASN'T FAIR.

20:26.542 --> 20:28.875
AND WHEN YOU
CALLED ME ON IT,

20:28.875 --> 20:33.458
I WAS DEFENSIVE
AND JUDGEMENTAL,
WHICH WASN'T FAIR, EITHER.

20:35.750 --> 20:38.708
BESIDES, WHAT DO I REALLY
KNOW ABOUT YOU?

20:41.625 --> 20:43.750
I COULD SAY THE SAME
ABOUT YOU.

20:43.750 --> 20:48.792
ME? ABOUT ME
THERE'S REALLY
NOT MUCH TO KNOW.

20:48.792 --> 20:50.542
OH, COME ON.
THAT'S NOT AN ANSWER.

20:53.250 --> 20:55.000
YOU REMIND ME OF HIM.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.083
I REMIND YOU OF A GUY
WHO COULD CHEAT
ON HIS WIFE?

20:57.083 --> 20:58.959
STOP.

21:00.291 --> 21:01.500
YOU KNOW,
WHEN WE GOT TOGETHER,

21:01.500 --> 21:03.542
IT WASN'T EXACTLY CHEATING.

21:03.542 --> 21:05.542
EMILY HAD WALKED OUT ON HIM.

21:05.542 --> 21:07.291
SHE FELT THAT
HE SPENT TOO MUCH TIME
AT THE RESTAURANT,

21:07.291 --> 21:08.583
AND SHE WAS RIGHT.

21:08.583 --> 21:10.583
BUT WHAT SHE
DIDN'T UNDERSTAND
WAS THAT WITHOUT HIM,

21:10.583 --> 21:13.750
CIVILIZATION
WOULD HAVE FOLDED
IN 6 MONTHS.

21:13.750 --> 21:19.417
DANNY JUST HAS THIS
KIND OF INFECTIOUS IDEALISM.

21:19.417 --> 21:23.417
THIS BELIEF THAT THINGS
CAN WORK OUT.

21:26.375 --> 21:29.083
I THINK THAT'S
WHAT HE SEES IN YOU.

21:31.750 --> 21:33.917
YOU KNOW, WE DON'T
HAVE TO STAY OUT HERE
ON THE DOCK.

21:33.917 --> 21:34.625
YOU WANNA COME IN?

21:34.625 --> 21:38.959
NO. I CAME TO SAY I'M SORRY,

21:38.959 --> 21:43.458
AND NOW THAT I HAVE,
I SHOULD PROBABLY GO HOME.

21:43.458 --> 21:44.583
YOU SURE?

21:44.583 --> 21:46.917
YEAH.

21:46.917 --> 21:51.333
OK.

21:51.333 --> 21:54.959
WELL, GOOD NIGHT, KAREN.

21:54.959 --> 21:56.792
GOOD NIGHT, PACEY.

22:12.125 --> 22:15.000
SO, YOU LIKE HER?

22:15.000 --> 22:19.166
YEAH. YEAH, I DO.
SHE'S COOL, YOU KNOW?

22:19.166 --> 22:22.500
SHE WANTS ME TO COME
3 TIMES A WEEK.

22:22.500 --> 22:24.500
GOOD.

22:24.500 --> 22:27.417
GOOD? MY LACK
OF MENTAL HEALTH IS GOOD?

22:27.417 --> 22:31.542
YES, BECAUSE IT MEANS
THAT I WILL GET
TO SEE YOU MORE OFTEN.

22:33.500 --> 22:35.083
WHAT?

22:35.083 --> 22:39.333
WELL, WE JUST FOUND OUT
THAT MY DAD NEGLECTED
TO ADD LILY TO HIS WILL.

22:39.333 --> 22:42.583
AND WHAT DID
YOUR MOM SAY?

22:42.583 --> 22:45.417
WELL, MY MOM
SAID THE SAME THING
THE LAWYER SAID,

22:45.417 --> 22:46.417
WHICH IS THAT
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

22:46.417 --> 22:48.250
IT'S A TECHNICALITY
WE CAN WORK AROUND.

22:48.250 --> 22:50.667
WELL, IT PROBABLY IS.

22:50.667 --> 22:53.000
IT'S NOT. IT CAN'T BE.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.750
I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE,
I DON'T KNOW, LIKE,

22:55.750 --> 22:57.750
HANGING ONTO
THE WRONG THING HERE.

22:59.208 --> 23:00.458
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

23:00.458 --> 23:03.542
UM, MAYBE YOUR MOM
IS RIGHT, YOU KNOW?

23:03.542 --> 23:05.875
MAYBE THE WILL
ISN'T SUCH A BIG DEAL.

23:05.875 --> 23:07.917
IT'S PROBABLY--
IT'S PROBABLY NOTHING.

23:07.917 --> 23:11.708
IT'S PROBABLY
A RED HERRING,
OR SOMETHING.

23:11.708 --> 23:12.667
A MEANINGLESS
LITTLE DETAIL

23:12.667 --> 23:13.834
SENT TO YOU
BY THE UNIVERSE

23:13.834 --> 23:17.708
TO THROW YOU OFF TRACK
OF THE REAL CULPRIT.

23:17.708 --> 23:19.250
AND WHO IS THAT?

23:19.250 --> 23:23.708
I MEAN, HE JUST
MADE A MISTAKE, DAWSON.

23:25.208 --> 23:27.166
I KNOW. I'M NOT SAYING
HE'S PERFECT.

23:27.166 --> 23:29.417
I KNOW,
BUT YOU JUST SEEM--

23:31.333 --> 23:33.000
YOU'RE SO AFRAID
TO GET MAD AT HIM.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.375
I'M NOT.

23:34.375 --> 23:36.208
WHAT GOOD--

23:36.208 --> 23:39.583
IT'S NOT GONNA
CHANGE ANYTHING.

23:39.583 --> 23:43.083
BUT IT MIGHT CHANGE YOU.

23:43.083 --> 23:44.750
AND CALL ME CRAZY,
BUT IT THINK THAT IS

23:44.750 --> 23:47.000
THE POINT OF THERAPY.

23:49.500 --> 23:51.166
IT WAS ON THIS SITE THAT...

23:51.166 --> 23:53.041
OK, SO THIS IS THE STUFF
OF ME GIVING THE TOUR.

23:53.041 --> 23:54.959
GEORGE TOOK THIS.
IT'S NICE, ISN'T IT?

23:54.959 --> 23:57.083
THE LIGHTING'S GOOD,
AND I THINK IT'S BETTER
THAN THE STUFF

23:57.083 --> 23:58.458
OF ME PRETENDING
TO STUDY, RIGHT?

23:58.458 --> 24:01.417
THEY'RE ALL GREAT,
AUDREY, BUT, YOU KNOW,
I'M GONNA BE LATE.

24:01.417 --> 24:02.750
JUST CHILL. THERE'S ONLY
ONE MORE OPTION, OK?

24:08.125 --> 24:12.083
I KNOW, GREAT BIRTHDAY
PRESENT, RIGHT?

24:12.083 --> 24:17.583
I MEAN, WHAT 14-YEAR-OLD
WANTS TO FEND FOR THEMSELVES
LIKE AN ADULT?

24:17.583 --> 24:24.375
BUT I HAVE TO FORGIVE HER,
I KNOW THAT.

24:24.375 --> 24:27.875
'CAUSE FORGIVING HER
IS THE ONLY WAY

24:27.875 --> 24:29.959
THAT I'M EVER GONNA BE GOOD
TO ANYONE ELSE.

24:29.959 --> 24:34.417
THE PART THAT'S JUST
REALLY JUST TERRIFYING

24:34.417 --> 24:35.625
IS THAT I THINK
THAT I'M ACTUALLY...

24:35.625 --> 24:39.667
I DON'T KNOW, I'M, LIKE,
TURNING INTO HER.

24:39.667 --> 24:44.625
I'M LOUD AND SHAMELESS
AND BOSSY

24:44.625 --> 24:48.625
AND I...I FREAK PEOPLE OUT
SOMETIMES.

24:51.750 --> 24:56.458
BUT I DON'T THINK
THAT I CAN CHANGE THAT,

24:56.458 --> 24:58.375
'CAUSE EVEN IF I DON'T
PARTICULARLY LIKE WHO I AM,

24:58.375 --> 25:03.166
I--AT LEAST I KNOW
WHO THAT IS.

25:03.166 --> 25:06.083
I MEAN, IF I TRIED
TO CHANGE...

25:08.834 --> 25:10.792
WHO THE HELL KNOWS
WHO I'D BE?

25:16.083 --> 25:17.959
WHAT? WHAT'S WRONG?

25:17.959 --> 25:19.500
NOTHING'S WRONG.
THAT--THAT--
THAT'S GREAT.

25:19.500 --> 25:21.291
THAT'S IT. THAT IS...

25:21.291 --> 25:24.041
THAT'S THE ONE.

25:24.041 --> 25:26.208
BUT I'M JUST SITTING THERE
TALKING TO MYSELF.

25:26.208 --> 25:27.500
EXACTLY.

25:27.500 --> 25:29.458
BUT ISN'T IT KIND OF
CHEESY AND VULNERABLE?

25:29.458 --> 25:31.625
NO, IT'S YOU.
IT'S THE REAL YOU.

25:31.625 --> 25:32.625
I MEAN, THAT GIRL
IN THE VIDEO

25:32.625 --> 25:33.291
WHO'S NOT AFRAID
TO LOOK STUPID...

25:33.291 --> 25:35.834
THAT'S THE REAL YOU.

25:35.834 --> 25:39.333
AND FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,
I'VE MET YOUR MOM.

25:39.333 --> 25:41.458
I MEAN, YOU'RE
NOTHING LIKE HER.

25:41.458 --> 25:42.500
BYE.

25:42.500 --> 25:43.917
BYE.

25:56.208 --> 25:58.291
YOU KNOW, I'M SO SORRY
YOU'RE GONNA BE STUCK
BACK HERE ALL NIGHT.

25:58.291 --> 25:59.959
I MEAN, I FEEL LIKE
THE WICKED STEPMOTHER

25:59.959 --> 26:01.875
THAT'S KEEPING YOU
FROM THE BALL.

26:01.875 --> 26:04.500
I THINK
MY INNER PRINCESS
WILL GET OVER IT.

26:06.750 --> 26:07.875
WOW!

26:07.875 --> 26:12.875
YOU LOOK FANTASTIC.
I'M SO GLAD I HIRED YOU.

26:14.792 --> 26:17.125
YOU KNOW, I THINK
I WOULD LOOK PRETTY GOOD

26:17.125 --> 26:18.667
WITH A ROSE
BETWEEN MY TEETH.

26:20.875 --> 26:22.291
UH, HEY, EMILY!

26:23.667 --> 26:26.417
HI, PACEY.
STILL BURNING THE CREPES?

26:26.417 --> 26:28.166
YEAH. IT'S HARD
TO GET A HAND IN HERE,
YOU KNOW?

26:28.166 --> 26:29.625
EVERYBODY'S ALWAYS
GOOFING AROUND.

26:29.625 --> 26:32.083
HEY. I--I THOUGHT
YOU WEREN'T COMING.

26:32.083 --> 26:34.125
SO DID I.
IT'S KIND OF HARD
TO CELEBRATE THE SUCCESS

26:34.125 --> 26:36.625
OF THE RESTAURANT
THAT ALMOST RUINED
YOUR MARRIAGE.

26:36.625 --> 26:38.417
YEAH, I IMAGINE
THAT WOULD KINDA SUCK.

26:38.417 --> 26:40.959
DANCE WITH ME.
ANY TIME.

26:42.291 --> 26:43.250
YOU OK?

26:43.250 --> 26:45.875
YEAH.
SURE. FINE.

26:45.875 --> 26:48.583
WHAT DO YOU CARE?
YOU PROBABLY CALLED HER.

26:48.583 --> 26:50.792
WELL, YOU KNOW
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

26:50.792 --> 26:51.834
DO I?

26:55.083 --> 26:56.542
LOOK, KAREN,
I KNOW YOU THOUGHT

26:56.542 --> 26:58.125
TONIGHT WAS GONNA BE
YOUR DATE WITH DESTINY,

26:58.125 --> 26:59.166
BUT I'M JUST TRYING
TO BE A FRIEND HERE, OK?

26:59.166 --> 27:01.417
IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK
I NEED, IS A FRIEND?

27:01.417 --> 27:03.834
YEAH, 'CAUSE YOU OBVIOUSLY
DON'T HAVE TOO MANY OF 'EM,

27:03.834 --> 27:05.834
OR THEY WOULD'VE ALREADY
TOLD YOU HOW BADLY

27:05.834 --> 27:08.625
THIS IS GONNA END
FOR YOU, FOR HIM,
FOR EVERYBODY.

27:08.625 --> 27:10.208
THEY WOULD'VE TOLD YOU
THAT THINGS LIKE THIS--

27:10.208 --> 27:11.417
TOLD ME WHAT, PACEY?

27:11.417 --> 27:13.125
THAT MARRIED MEN
DON'T LEAVE THEIR WIVES

27:13.125 --> 27:14.667
FOR WAITRESSES
THEY'RE SLEEPING WITH?

27:14.667 --> 27:18.000
YEAH. THANKS
FOR THE NEWS FLASH.

27:21.125 --> 27:22.291
I THINK THE WORST PART
ABOUT IT

27:22.291 --> 27:24.625
WAS THAT MY MOM
DIDN'T EVEN SEEM TO CARE.

27:24.625 --> 27:26.959
IT'S LIKE SHE EXPECTED HIM
TO HAVE MESSED THIS THING UP.

27:26.959 --> 27:28.834
MAYBE THAT'S WHY
I GOT SO MAD.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.208
SO...YOU WERE MAD?

27:35.708 --> 27:38.375
YEAH. YEAH, I WAS.

27:38.375 --> 27:40.500
AT YOUR MOTHER...

27:40.500 --> 27:42.834
OR AT HIM
FOR NOT SIGNING IT?

27:44.875 --> 27:47.708
AT HIM, BUT I CAN'T BE
MAD AT HIM RIGHT NOW.

27:47.708 --> 27:48.542
SURE YOU CAN.

27:48.542 --> 27:51.375
WASN'T YOUR FATHER
MAD AT YOU?

27:51.375 --> 27:53.875
YOU TOLD ME
HE LAID DOWN THE LAW,

27:53.875 --> 27:55.208
BOUGHT YOU A PLANE TICKET.

27:55.208 --> 27:57.250
YEAH. I GAVE IT
RIGHT BACK TO HIM.

27:57.250 --> 27:58.834
AND YOU HAD REASONS
FOR THAT.

27:58.834 --> 28:00.500
YEAH, BUT HE OBVIOUSLY
HAD REASONS

28:00.500 --> 28:01.708
FOR WANTING ME
TO GO BACK TO USC.

28:01.708 --> 28:03.333
YES, HE DID.

28:03.333 --> 28:04.792
AND MAYBE HE WAS WRONG.

28:04.792 --> 28:07.834
IF HE WERE HERE
AND WE COULD ASK HIM,

28:07.834 --> 28:11.834
WE'D PROBABLY FIND OUT
THAT ALL THOSE REASONS

28:11.834 --> 28:13.792
WERE MORE ABOUT HIM--

28:13.792 --> 28:16.417
HIS HOPES,
HIS EXPECTATIONS.

28:16.417 --> 28:20.000
AND JUST BECAUSE HE DIED,

28:20.000 --> 28:22.542
DOESN'T MEAN THAT HE GETS
TO WIN THE ARGUMENT.

28:22.542 --> 28:25.667
WHEN I REMEMBER
THAT NIGHT,

28:25.667 --> 28:31.083
ALL I FEEL...
IS FURIOUS.

28:31.083 --> 28:32.917
THAT'S OK.

28:32.917 --> 28:35.834
THAT'S HOW YOU FEEL.

28:37.417 --> 28:40.625
SO WHAT DO I DO NOW?

28:40.625 --> 28:42.917
WHAT EVERY 18-YEAR-OLD
HAS TO DO:

28:42.917 --> 28:47.417
DECIDE WHAT TO DO
WITH YOUR OWN LIFE.

28:49.959 --> 28:51.375
AND WHAT IF
I DON'T KNOW?

28:51.375 --> 28:53.208
THAT'S FINE, TOO.

28:53.208 --> 28:56.208
ALTHOUGH, PERSONALLY...

28:56.208 --> 28:58.458
I THINK YOU DO KNOW.

29:28.083 --> 29:29.417
HEY, TORRES.

29:31.166 --> 29:33.291
HEY, PACEY.
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

29:33.291 --> 29:35.750
WELL, WHEN I WAS RUNNING
MY MOUTH OFF BACK THERE,

29:35.750 --> 29:39.208
I FORGOT TO MENTION
ONE THING.

29:39.208 --> 29:41.375
YOU LOOK AMAZING TONIGHT.

29:43.959 --> 29:47.917
YOU EVER WISH
YOU WERE SOMEONE ELSE?

29:47.917 --> 29:51.166
YEAH. HARRISON FORD,
RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK.

29:51.166 --> 29:52.792
NO. I DON'T MEAN
SOMEONE SPECIFIC.

29:52.792 --> 29:54.083
I JUST MEAN
SOMEONE ELSE,

29:54.083 --> 29:57.250
SOMEONE...
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
FROM WHO YOU ARE.

29:57.250 --> 29:59.917
THAT'S WHAT I WANT
RIGHT NOW.

30:02.083 --> 30:05.583
WELL, HI, I'M SCOTT.

30:05.583 --> 30:07.000
AND YOU ARE?

30:07.000 --> 30:08.667
I'M...I'M MARIE.

30:08.667 --> 30:11.000
NICE TO MEET YOU,
SCOTT.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU,
TOO, MARIE.

30:12.000 --> 30:15.500
YOU ARE WITHOUT A DOUBT
THE SINGLE MOST

30:15.500 --> 30:17.500
JAW-DROPPINGLY
BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
IN THIS ROOM.

30:17.500 --> 30:20.875
AND I WAS WONDERING
IF YOU WOULD HONOR ME
WITH A DANCE.

30:22.708 --> 30:24.291
YEAH.

30:34.458 --> 30:37.125
SO, TELL ME, MARIE,

30:37.125 --> 30:37.708
WHERE ARE YOU FROM?

30:37.708 --> 30:41.583
JUST DROP IT, PACEY.

30:41.583 --> 30:43.542
PACEY?
WHO IS THIS PACEY?

30:43.542 --> 30:46.417
I HAVE A FUNNY FEELING
I SHOULD BE INSULTED.

30:46.417 --> 30:48.417
HOW CAN HE...

30:48.417 --> 30:49.583
I MEAN,
HOW CAN HE JUST--

30:49.583 --> 30:50.834
YOU KNOW,
JUST CALM DOWN, KAREN.

30:50.834 --> 30:52.583
I NEED TO GO
TALK TO HIM.

30:52.583 --> 30:55.500
I THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE
A REALLY BAD IDEA.

30:55.500 --> 30:57.625
I DON'T CARE.

30:57.625 --> 31:00.000
KAREN, WHAT WOULD
YOU SAY TO HIM?

31:00.000 --> 31:03.083
SERIOUSLY,
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?

31:09.375 --> 31:10.667
HERE YOU GO,
JOEY.

31:10.667 --> 31:12.333
THANK YOU.
SORRY.

31:12.333 --> 31:15.333
WE'LL FORGIVE YOU
IF YOU BROUGHT
STRING CHEESE.

31:15.333 --> 31:17.625
NO? OK. GUESS
YOU HAD TO BE THERE.

31:17.625 --> 31:20.208
CASSANDRA,
YOU WERE WOWING US
WITH YOUR THEORY.

31:20.208 --> 31:23.125
IT'S NOT A THEORY,
REALLY, JUST A NOTION.

31:23.125 --> 31:26.041
I THINK WHOEVER
ROSE WAS WRITING
THOSE LETTERS TO

31:26.041 --> 31:28.458
MUST ALSO HAVE BEEN
A WRITER.

31:28.458 --> 31:31.458
I MEAN, BESIDES SEX,
THAT'S PRACTICALLY
ALL SHE TALKS ABOUT,

31:31.458 --> 31:33.250
HER INSECURITIES
ABOUT WRITING.

31:33.250 --> 31:35.834
AND WHO CARES
ABOUT WRITING
EXCEPT OTHER WRITERS?

31:35.834 --> 31:37.041
WELL,
IT'S HIGHLY POSSIBLE.

31:37.041 --> 31:39.333
JOEY, AGREE OR DISAGREE?

31:39.333 --> 31:40.708
UH, I STRONGLY AGREE.

31:40.708 --> 31:45.375
SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE
A THEORY OF YOUR OWN
YOU'D LIKE TO SHARE.

31:45.375 --> 31:49.375
I THINK ROSE LAZARE'S
GREATEST CONFIDANT
WAS ANOTHER WRITER.

31:49.375 --> 31:51.792
I THINK
SHE WAS ROSE LAZARE.

31:51.792 --> 31:54.750
I'LL BITE.

31:54.750 --> 31:58.083
WELL, I--I THINK
SHE WAS WRITING
THE LETTERS TO HERSELF.

31:58.083 --> 31:59.959
I THINK THEY WERE
LIKE A JOURNAL OR A DIARY

31:59.959 --> 32:02.542
OR A CONFESSIONAL
OF SOME KIND

32:02.542 --> 32:04.458
BECAUSE THEY'RE
ALL ABOUT WRITING,

32:04.458 --> 32:06.166
AND THERE ARE NO ENVELOPES,
AND THERE'S NO SMALL TALK

32:06.166 --> 32:07.792
LIKE IN ALL
THE OTHER LETTERS.

32:07.792 --> 32:10.208
THE UNINTERESTING ONES?

32:10.208 --> 32:12.583
RIGHT. I MEAN,
THEY'RE ALL FILLED
WITH REFERENCES

32:12.583 --> 32:14.458
ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON
AROUND HER.

32:14.458 --> 32:16.000
YOU KNOW, EVERYDAY LIFE,
POLITICAL EVENTS,

32:16.000 --> 32:19.625
UH, MUTUAL FRIENDS,
PUBLISHERS, EDITORS.

32:19.625 --> 32:22.083
AND THESE LETTERS
ARE ALL ABOUT HERSELF.

32:22.083 --> 32:24.333
YOU KNOW, HER FEARS
AND INSECURITIES--
THE REAL HER.

32:24.333 --> 32:25.625
AND I THINK THE ONLY PERSON

32:25.625 --> 32:27.542
THAT SHE WAS BRAVE ENOUGH
TO SHARE THAT WITH

32:27.542 --> 32:29.166
WAS HERSELF.

32:31.625 --> 32:34.417
AM I A TOTAL IDIOT?

32:34.417 --> 32:36.834
NO, JOEY POTTER.

32:36.834 --> 32:37.917
I THINK THAT HUSH
YOU'RE HEARING

32:37.917 --> 32:40.708
IS THE SILENCE
OF 5 PEOPLE

32:40.708 --> 32:42.750
SIMULTANEOUSLY
ASKING THEMSELVES,

32:42.750 --> 32:44.834
"WHY DIDN'T I
THINK OF THAT?"

32:54.583 --> 32:57.959
KAFKA WRITES SOMETHING
VERY SIMILAR TO FELICE.

32:57.959 --> 33:00.291
"WRITING LETTERS IS LIKE
COMMUNICATING WITH GHOSTS,

33:00.291 --> 33:02.708
"AND NOT JUST THE GHOST
OF THE PERSON ADDRESSED,

33:02.708 --> 33:04.667
BUT WITH YOUR OWN GHOST
AS WELL."

33:04.667 --> 33:06.041
WHO'S FELICE?

33:06.041 --> 33:08.333
KAFKA'S FIANCE.
THEY HAD THIS
INTENSE ROMANCE,

33:08.333 --> 33:10.458
A KIND OF WILL-THEY,
WON'T THEY THAT WENT
ON FOR YEARS.

33:10.458 --> 33:13.125
ULTIMATELY...
NOTHING HAPPENED.

33:13.125 --> 33:14.208
OH.

33:14.208 --> 33:15.583
YOU WANNA HAND ME
THAT GLASS?

33:15.583 --> 33:18.208
YEAH.

33:18.208 --> 33:20.125
DO YOU REALLY THINK
I WAS RIGHT ABOUT
THOSE LETTERS?

33:20.125 --> 33:23.500
YOURS WAS THE BEST IDEA
I'VE HEARD SO FAR.

33:23.500 --> 33:25.500
I'M NOT SURPRISED.
YOU'RE A FRESHMAN.

33:25.500 --> 33:27.250
YOUR BRAIN HAS YET
TO BE ENCODED

33:27.250 --> 33:29.166
WITH YOUR DISCIPLINE'S
RECEIVED IDEAS.

33:29.166 --> 33:31.500
OH, SO,
IN NONACADEMIC TERMS,

33:31.500 --> 33:33.333
I'M JUST TOO STUPID
TO KNOW ANY BETTER?

33:33.333 --> 33:35.458
WOULD YOU SETTLE FOR
HAVING AN OPEN MIND?

33:35.458 --> 33:37.291
FOR MOST PEOPLE
IN COLLEGE,

33:37.291 --> 33:38.792
THAT'S THE FIRST THING
TO GO.

33:38.792 --> 33:43.792
WOW. I HADN'T PEGGED YOU
FOR SUCH A HARDCORE CYNIC.

33:43.792 --> 33:45.792
I'M NOT.

33:47.375 --> 33:49.291
LOOK.
IT'S LIKE THIS.

33:49.291 --> 33:51.959
MOST PEOPLE, WHEN
THEY GET TO COLLEGE,

33:51.959 --> 33:54.166
FEEL
REALLY INSECURE.

33:54.166 --> 33:57.041
IT SEEMS LIKE
EVERYBODY AROUND THEM
KNOWS SO MUCH MORE.

33:57.041 --> 33:59.250
SO THEY RACE
TO TRY TO CATCH UP,

33:59.250 --> 34:00.375
PRETEND TO KNOW THINGS,

34:00.375 --> 34:03.000
INSTEAD OF SLOWING DOWN
TO ACTUALLY LEARN THEM.

34:04.041 --> 34:05.208
BECAUSE
THEY DON'T REALIZE

34:05.208 --> 34:07.792
THAT THE DISCOMFORT
OF UNCERTAINTY

34:07.792 --> 34:10.875
IS THE MOST PRECIOUS PART
OF THE EXPERIENCE.

34:12.792 --> 34:14.708
SEE, IF YOU CAN FEEL
COMFORTABLE...

34:14.708 --> 34:16.875
NOT KNOWING,

34:16.875 --> 34:18.792
YOU CAN LEARN ANYTHING,

34:18.792 --> 34:20.542
ANYTHING.

34:20.542 --> 34:21.875
AND IF NOT,

34:21.875 --> 34:25.375
WELL, THEN YOU'VE STOPPED
BEFORE YOU'VE BEGUN.

34:28.417 --> 34:33.375
FOR A WHILE, I WAS...
FEELING INSECURE.

34:33.375 --> 34:33.875
NO.

34:33.875 --> 34:37.000
AND I JUST...

34:37.000 --> 34:40.667
I GUESS WHAT
I'M SAYING IS, UM...

34:40.667 --> 34:43.875
THANKS FOR CHOOSING ME
TO BE ON THIS PROJECT.

34:43.875 --> 34:46.291
THANK YOU
FOR STICKING WITH IT.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.708
GRAB THAT STUFF.
I'LL CLEAN THE REST
TOMORROW.

34:50.708 --> 34:52.417
CAN I ASK YOU ONE MORE
STUPID QUESTION?

34:52.417 --> 34:53.291
SHOOT.

34:53.291 --> 34:55.417
WHO THE HELL
IS DERRIDA ANYWAY?

34:55.417 --> 34:57.750
HA HA! WELL, UH,
LET'S JUST SAY

34:57.750 --> 34:59.708
IF LITERATURE WERE
THE STAR WARS  UNIVERSE,

34:59.708 --> 35:01.375
HE WOULD BE LIKE
THE DARTH MAUL.

35:11.750 --> 35:12.834
Radio: WBCW.

35:12.834 --> 35:15.417
UH, THIS IS JEN LINDLEY,

35:15.417 --> 35:17.208
AND I'VE BEEN
LETTING YOU PEOPLE

35:17.208 --> 35:18.417
MAKE REQUESTS
FOR LONG ENOUGH NOW.

35:18.417 --> 35:21.583
TONIGHT I HAVE
A DEDICATION OF MY OWN.

35:21.583 --> 35:24.834
AND THIS ONE GOES OUT
TO A VERY OLD FRIEND

35:24.834 --> 35:26.875
WHO'S SEEN ME AT MY BEST

35:26.875 --> 35:29.291
AND AT MY WORST,

35:29.291 --> 35:32.792
AND ONE NIGHT
AT MERCER POND,

35:32.792 --> 35:36.625
GOT A PRETTY GOOD VIEW OF ME
IN NOTHING AT ALL.

35:50.458 --> 35:51.291
Dawson: HERE I COME.

35:54.083 --> 35:55.708
WHOO!

35:58.125 --> 36:01.417
OHH! INVIGORATING!

36:02.500 --> 36:04.875
[LAUGHING]

36:21.375 --> 36:24.500
YOU REALLY GOT THE IDEA
FROM MY TAPE?

36:25.750 --> 36:29.333
YES.

36:29.333 --> 36:32.000
AND...
WAS WILDER IMPRESSED?

36:32.000 --> 36:34.750
I DON'T KNOW.
I THINK SO.

36:34.750 --> 36:37.625
HMM. HOW IMPRESSED?

36:38.000 --> 36:39.959
AUDREY.

36:39.959 --> 36:41.959
JOEY, YOU SAID
YOU WERE THERE

36:41.959 --> 36:43.583
AFTER EVERYONE ELSE LEFT.

36:43.583 --> 36:46.792
OHH, AUDREY,
PLEASE SHUT UP.

36:46.792 --> 36:48.583
YOU DON'T CARE THAT
YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY
IMPRESSED HIM

36:48.583 --> 36:50.834
AND THAT HE OBVIOUSLY
THINKS YOU'RE SPECIAL?

36:50.834 --> 36:53.208
HEH. NO.

36:53.208 --> 36:56.875
I JUST DON'T CARE
AT ALL.

36:56.875 --> 36:58.875
[SCOFFS]

37:27.291 --> 37:28.417
HEY.

37:28.417 --> 37:30.208
HEY.

37:30.208 --> 37:32.750
I FIGURED IT WAS MY TURN
TO COME VISIT YOU.

37:35.333 --> 37:36.417
WHAT'S THAT?

37:36.417 --> 37:38.750
IT'S A SAMPLE PLATTER
OF TONIGHT'S MENU.

37:38.750 --> 37:42.625
I NOTICED
YOU DIDN'T REALLY EAT
TOO MUCH OF ANYTHING

37:42.625 --> 37:43.708
AT THE RESTAURANT.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.458
YOU KNOW, I HATE YOU
FOR MAKING ME SAY THIS,

37:53.458 --> 37:55.917
BUT...THANK YOU.

37:55.917 --> 37:57.208
FOR WHAT?

37:57.208 --> 37:59.417
FOR THIS--
FOR BRINGING ME DINNER,

37:59.417 --> 38:02.083
FOR LISTENING
THE OTHER NIGHT,

38:02.083 --> 38:04.333
FOR TRYING TO SAVE ME
WHEN I TOLD YOU NOT TO,

38:04.333 --> 38:06.542
FOR NOT SAYING,
"I TOLD YOU SO."

38:06.542 --> 38:08.583
THAT LAST ONE MAY BE
A BRIDGE TOO FAR,

38:08.583 --> 38:10.083
BECAUSE
I DID TELL YOU SO,

38:10.083 --> 38:12.208
AND I HAVE NO PROBLEM
TELLING YOU THAT I DID.

38:12.208 --> 38:14.417
HE JUST--
HE KISSED HER...

38:14.417 --> 38:15.125
RIGHT THERE
IN FRONT OF ME,

38:15.125 --> 38:17.500
LIKE I WASN'T EVEN THERE.

38:17.500 --> 38:20.250
WELL, PUBLIC KISSING IS
ONE OF THE TRADITIONAL
BENEFITS OF MARRIAGE.

38:20.250 --> 38:22.792
I NEED TO BREAK IT
OFF WITH HIM.

38:22.792 --> 38:24.041
I MEAN, I JUST--
I NEED TO END THIS.

38:24.041 --> 38:25.166
I NEED TO MOVE ON.

38:25.166 --> 38:28.166
BECAUSE HE'S OBVIOUSLY
NOT GONNA LEAVE HER AND...

38:28.166 --> 38:30.458
WHICH MEANS WE'RE
NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

38:31.875 --> 38:34.959
THAT'S GOOD.

38:36.500 --> 38:37.333
GOD, THIS IS EMBARRASSING.

38:37.333 --> 38:39.417
I'M JUST
ANOTHER SINGLE FEMALE

38:39.417 --> 38:40.625
WITH A DESTRUCTIVE
DATING PATTERN.

38:40.625 --> 38:43.208
WELL, THEN DO
LIKE YOU SAID.
CHANGE IT.

38:43.208 --> 38:44.875
WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN,
CHANGE IT?

38:44.875 --> 38:46.417
I MEAN, TO WHAT?
TO YOU?

38:47.959 --> 38:50.458
SORRY.

38:51.458 --> 38:52.500
JUST DIG IN, OK?

38:54.458 --> 38:56.542
DO YOU WANT TO JOIN ME?

38:56.542 --> 38:59.041
I MIGHT EVEN HAVE A TABLE
UNDER THERE SOMEWHERE.

38:59.041 --> 39:01.250
SURE.

39:01.250 --> 39:02.625
Answering Machine:
HI, THIS IS KAREN.

39:02.625 --> 39:03.458
IF YOU WANT ME
TO KNOW WHO YOU ARE,

39:03.458 --> 39:06.041
I SUGGEST
YOU LEAVE A MESSAGE.

39:06.041 --> 39:06.959
[BEEP]

39:06.959 --> 39:08.834
Brecher:
HEY, UH, IT'S ME.

39:08.834 --> 39:12.333
SO, YOU LEFT.

39:12.333 --> 39:14.500
UH, I CAN'T SAY
I BLAME YOU.

39:14.500 --> 39:16.208
GOD, WHAT A MESS, KAREN.

39:16.208 --> 39:18.083
I'M SO SORRY YOU HAD
TO GO THROUGH THAT.

39:18.083 --> 39:22.333
MY, MY LIFE IS SO...
COMPLICATED RIGHT NOW,

39:22.333 --> 39:24.583
AND I'M SORRY THAT YOU'RE STUCK
IN THE MIDDLE OF IT.

39:24.583 --> 39:28.000
I...I KNOW THAT THAT MEANS
PRACTICALLY NOTHING TO YOU,

39:28.000 --> 39:30.208
AND I KNOW THAT YOU JUST WANT
TO PUNCH ME IN THE FACE,

39:30.208 --> 39:31.125
AND YOU HAVE
EVERY RIGHT TO, BUT...

39:31.125 --> 39:33.542
I LOVE YOU, KAREN.

39:33.542 --> 39:36.000
I--I REALLY DO...

39:36.000 --> 39:38.583
IN WAYS BIG AND SMALL.

39:39.875 --> 39:43.083
I NEVER WANTED YOU
TO GET HURT.

39:43.083 --> 39:45.125
PLEASE, KAREN,
IF YOU'RE THERE,

39:45.125 --> 39:46.542
PICK UP, PLEASE.

39:46.542 --> 39:47.500
I JUST--I WANNA TALK.

39:47.500 --> 39:50.708
I JUST WANT TO KNOW
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

39:55.917 --> 39:57.708
YOU STILL UP?

39:57.708 --> 39:59.417
OHH, IF I DON'T
KEEP READING,

39:59.417 --> 40:02.041
I'LL WIND UP ONLY
SPEAKING BABY TALK.

40:02.041 --> 40:04.375
[CHUCKLES]

40:04.375 --> 40:06.875
OH, YOU'VE GOT,
UH, MAIL.

40:06.875 --> 40:07.708
WHAT IS IT?

40:07.708 --> 40:10.542
I DON'T KNOW.
OPEN IT AND SEE.

40:19.500 --> 40:23.166
I SEEM TO HAVE WON
A FILM FESTIVAL

40:23.166 --> 40:24.750
IN HOOKSETT,
NEW HAMPSHIRE.

40:24.750 --> 40:26.333
WHICH IS...
REALLY BIZARRE

40:26.333 --> 40:27.667
BECAUSE I NEVER ENTERED

40:27.667 --> 40:29.417
A FILM FESTIVAL IN
HOOKSETT, NEW HAMPSHIRE.

40:29.417 --> 40:30.583
NO, BUT YOUR FATHER DID.

40:30.583 --> 40:33.959
YEP. HE WASN'T VERY GOOD
WITH LITTLE DETAILS,

40:33.959 --> 40:36.708
BUT...HE ALWAYS
BELIEVED IN YOU.

40:41.291 --> 40:44.500
I'M NOT GOING
BACK TO USC.

40:44.500 --> 40:46.250
OK.

40:46.250 --> 40:47.667
OK?

40:47.667 --> 40:49.792
THE LAST THING I WANT
YOU TO DO IS GO BACK

40:49.792 --> 40:51.917
TO A SCHOOL
THAT YOU DON'T LIKE

40:51.917 --> 40:54.500
OUT OF SOME
MISPLACED DESIRE TO HONOR
YOUR FATHER'S MEMORY.

40:54.500 --> 40:56.708
BUT HE WAS SO SET
ON ME GOING BACK THERE.

40:56.708 --> 40:59.208
NO. HE WASN'T READY
TO GIVE UP ON THE DREAM,

40:59.208 --> 41:01.792
BUT HE WOULD'VE.

41:01.792 --> 41:03.667
YOU HAD YOUR REASONS
FOR LEAVING.

41:03.667 --> 41:05.542
YOU'D HAVE WON HIM OVER.

41:05.542 --> 41:07.208
YOU THINK?

41:07.208 --> 41:09.625
OH, HONEY, UNDER ALL
THAT BLUSTER AND CONCERN,

41:09.625 --> 41:13.500
HE KNEW IT WAS
YOUR DECISION TO MAKE.

41:27.125 --> 41:30.500
I MISS HIM.

41:30.500 --> 41:32.291
SO DO I.

41:34.291 --> 41:36.667
HE COULD BE SO--

41:36.667 --> 41:37.333
I KNOW. I KNOW.

41:37.333 --> 41:39.959
HE COULDN'T MAKE A PB&J

41:39.959 --> 41:41.625
WITHOUT GETTING JELLY
IN THE PEANUT BUTTER JAR.

41:41.625 --> 41:44.542
AND HE WOULD REFUSE
TO BUY SOCKS.

41:44.542 --> 41:48.708
HE WOULD JUST
BORROW MINE.

41:51.708 --> 41:53.917
I LOVED HIM...

41:55.125 --> 41:56.834
YOU KNOW?

41:59.333 --> 42:00.917
ME, TOO.

42:08.792 --> 42:10.333
