(grunting)

00:04.305 --> 00:06.440
(roaring)

00:06.474 --> 00:09.443
- There is dark potential
in this boy.

00:09.477 --> 00:11.946
He deserves a trophy
for his kill.

00:11.980 --> 00:13.982
- I'm here to clean.
- Cool.

00:14.015 --> 00:16.617
- I know I promised
we'd get you a nuke,

00:16.651 --> 00:18.953
but it's not exactly like
running down to the corner store

00:18.987 --> 00:21.322
for a loaf of bread.
- The world is dying.

00:21.355 --> 00:24.525
You and Mr. Quinlan
are its last hope.

00:24.558 --> 00:26.961
- Hey...
- Oh...

00:26.995 --> 00:29.630
- Quinlan, this is
my new friend Roman.

00:29.664 --> 00:33.001
Roman used to work at a missile
base down the street.

00:33.034 --> 00:35.036
- Is there a weapon?
- So he says.

00:35.069 --> 00:37.205
- Goodweather
is out there somewhere.

00:37.238 --> 00:40.041
- My legion is searching
for them.

00:40.074 --> 00:42.877
As well as rounding up
every nuclear weapon.

00:44.545 --> 00:46.047
- You two are blowing up buses

00:46.080 --> 00:47.215
and you don't even know
they use them

00:47.248 --> 00:48.883
to transport human prisoners?

00:48.917 --> 00:50.885
- If we waited for the perfect,
polite moment to revolt,

00:50.919 --> 00:52.520
it would never happen.

00:52.553 --> 00:55.056
- Those big Partnership
buildings, I saw them pumping

00:55.089 --> 00:57.892
tankerfuls of blood
into the pipes.

00:57.926 --> 00:59.828
If you could
put something poisonous

00:59.861 --> 01:01.830
into that blood,
you could take out

01:01.863 --> 01:03.998
thousands of strigoi
and they wouldn't know

01:04.032 --> 01:06.534
what hit them.
- Okay. Let's do that.

01:10.538 --> 01:12.874

01:12.907 --> 01:15.409

01:57.118 --> 01:59.553
I guess that means, uh...

01:59.587 --> 02:01.622

02:08.830 --> 02:11.432

- VELDERS: Oh, yeah?
How can you tell?

02:14.468 --> 02:16.905
- My sinuses.
They're very sensitive

02:16.938 --> 02:18.907
to the barometric pressure.

02:18.940 --> 02:21.409
- Bullshit.

02:21.442 --> 02:24.745
- Your missile silo
is not marked on the map.

02:24.779 --> 02:26.747
- That would kind of defeat
the whole

02:26.781 --> 02:28.649
secret base thing,
wouldn't it?

02:28.682 --> 02:30.318

02:34.956 --> 02:36.925
- How many people
are we gonna to find there?

02:36.958 --> 02:38.960
- Five, plus my C.O.

02:38.993 --> 02:40.461
- You think they're still there?

02:40.494 --> 02:43.597
- Why would they leave?
They had supplies for two years.

02:43.631 --> 02:45.599
If... You know, if anything,

02:45.633 --> 02:48.769
I think more folks
will be there.

02:48.803 --> 02:50.939
- I hope they didn't run into

02:50.972 --> 02:54.175
that muncher convoy that we saw.

02:54.208 --> 02:56.177
- How will your friends react
to us taking the warhead?

02:56.210 --> 02:58.646
- Oh, they're cool.

02:58.679 --> 03:00.781
What the hell
they gonna do with it, right?

03:00.815 --> 03:04.185
Military's gone
and we're living in a...

03:04.218 --> 03:06.187
nuclear winter.

03:06.220 --> 03:08.622
Who gives a shit?

03:08.656 --> 03:10.658

03:10.691 --> 03:12.994

their missiles.

03:13.027 --> 03:16.130
You got any idea who did?

03:16.164 --> 03:18.166

03:20.168 --> 03:22.136
India and Pakistan?

03:22.170 --> 03:24.138
Iran and Israel?

03:24.172 --> 03:27.008
- Don't forget the Russians.

03:27.041 --> 03:29.143

to hunting, gathering,

03:31.179 --> 03:33.314
and dodging predators.

03:35.183 --> 03:37.051

05:21.289 --> 05:23.657

a powerful blood thinner.

05:23.691 --> 05:26.094
My thinking is these creatures

05:26.127 --> 05:28.096
are streamlined

05:28.129 --> 05:30.598
blood-processing machines.
So they should be

05:30.631 --> 05:33.134
highly susceptible
to systemic damage.

05:39.473 --> 05:42.643
My son, Scott,

05:42.676 --> 05:45.779
he used to love to help me cook.

05:45.813 --> 05:48.449
That boy developed
a very complicated relationship

05:48.482 --> 05:50.284
with food.

05:50.318 --> 05:52.453
He wrote an essay
in the third grade

05:52.486 --> 05:55.456
called "Meat Loaf Makes Me Sad."

05:55.489 --> 05:57.525
- Why sad?

05:57.558 --> 05:59.793

meatloaf in the fall.

05:59.827 --> 06:01.996
You know, comfort food
for cold weather.

06:02.030 --> 06:05.166
So, when Scott
smelled meat loaf,

06:05.199 --> 06:07.535
he knew that summer was over.

06:07.568 --> 06:09.537
- Well, sounds like
an observant kid.

06:09.570 --> 06:12.340
- Yeah. Funny. Oh.

06:12.373 --> 06:15.009
Nobody could make me laugh
like him.

06:46.574 --> 06:48.542

roll up, and pump it

06:48.576 --> 06:50.878

Security's too tight.

I was living in New York.

20:12.880 --> 20:15.482

- After the...

20:15.515 --> 20:18.886
nukes went off, I had
to get away from the fallout.

20:18.919 --> 20:22.322

a car. He was going to Philly.

It was totally random.

20:30.763 --> 20:33.066

they can't cross moving water.

29:41.313 --> 29:44.551
- Is it true?
- Some are sick.

29:44.584 --> 29:48.054
But not because of the food.
It's because of the fallout

29:48.087 --> 29:50.222
from the bombs the humans
dropped on each other.

29:50.256 --> 29:52.224

30:04.937 --> 30:06.906
For thousands of years

30:06.939 --> 30:10.610

has been at war with itself:

30:12.612 --> 30:14.581
religion, Marxism,

30:14.614 --> 30:16.749
fascism, capitalism.

30:16.783 --> 30:19.285
Sound ideas in theory,

30:19.318 --> 30:22.489
but each defeated
by an essential flaw

30:22.522 --> 30:25.291
in the human psyche.

30:25.324 --> 30:27.326
- What flaw?

30:27.359 --> 30:29.629
- Human selfishness and vanity

30:29.662 --> 30:32.765
are ingrained, indelible.

30:32.799 --> 30:34.767
I know this

30:34.801 --> 30:36.769
because the minds
of millions of humans

30:36.803 --> 30:38.971
exist within me.

30:41.307 --> 30:43.275
- Seriously?

30:43.309 --> 30:46.613
- I possess the consciousness

30:46.646 --> 30:48.615
of every individual

30:48.648 --> 30:50.783
my spawn have turned.

30:50.817 --> 30:53.486
And of all the creatures
in the natural world...

30:55.522 --> 30:58.024
the human animal
is the most dangerous,

30:58.057 --> 31:01.661
given to impulsive acts
of violence.

31:04.230 --> 31:06.198
- But what about the others?

31:06.232 --> 31:09.368
The ones down there?
The survivors.

31:09.401 --> 31:13.305
- Their leaders cast them
into darkness.

31:13.339 --> 31:16.643
But, fortunately,

31:16.676 --> 31:19.546
a new species has risen
to supplant them,

31:19.579 --> 31:22.649
united by
a single consciousness,

31:22.682 --> 31:24.817
a single purpose.

31:24.851 --> 31:28.054
There will be no more wars.

31:28.087 --> 31:30.990
I will make sure
their vicious impulses

31:31.023 --> 31:33.860
never ravage this world again.

31:36.863 --> 31:38.698
And you, Zack,

31:38.731 --> 31:41.701
can help me do that.

31:44.203 --> 31:46.072
Or you can return

31:46.105 --> 31:49.175
to being an ordinary,
lonely boy.

31:49.208 --> 31:51.210
The choice is yours.

31:51.243 --> 31:54.046
Of course, you will
no longer live here.

31:54.080 --> 31:57.016
I wonder how the girl will feel

31:57.049 --> 31:59.185
when she has no job

31:59.218 --> 32:02.221
and you have nothing
to offer her.

32:06.959 --> 32:08.928
- No.

32:08.961 --> 32:11.463
I want to help you.

32:13.299 --> 32:15.735
- Very good, my son.

32:43.596 --> 32:47.466
- This is a Whiskey 8-5-Mod-4
variable-yield nuclear warhead.

32:47.499 --> 32:49.568
- The Lumen says that the Face
of God is

32:49.602 --> 32:51.904
"a light of such
majestic brilliance

32:51.938 --> 32:53.740
that the Master's essence
is destroyed."

32:53.773 --> 32:57.443
Sounds like this'll
do the job, huh?

33:07.286 --> 33:09.255
- I wouldn't get, uh...

33:09.288 --> 33:11.958
too excited just yet.

33:11.991 --> 33:15.762
- What's wrong?
- It's missing the pit assembly.

33:15.795 --> 33:19.098
- What the hell is a pit
assembly?

33:19.131 --> 33:21.300
- The pit would be a 10-pound
hollow plutonium sphere

33:21.333 --> 33:25.271
that the exploding PBX
squishes into critical mass,

33:25.304 --> 33:27.640
which then produces
the big bang.

33:27.674 --> 33:30.276
- And that's what
used to be in the center here?

33:30.309 --> 33:32.111
- Exactly.
- So we're screwed.

33:32.144 --> 33:33.946
You led us
on a wild goose chase.

33:33.980 --> 33:35.948
- If we find
the number 1-2-A pit,

33:35.982 --> 33:38.951
this is a perfectly functional
nuclear weapon.

33:38.985 --> 33:41.487
- If we find the pit.

33:43.489 --> 33:45.792
- The muncher convoy we saw.

33:45.825 --> 33:47.794
Maybe that's
what they were doing.

33:47.827 --> 33:49.796
- The Master used
a nuclear weapon

33:49.829 --> 33:51.798
to eliminate the Ancients.
Now he wants

33:51.831 --> 33:53.132
to take the others out of play.

33:53.165 --> 33:55.134
- And destroy them.

33:55.167 --> 33:58.137
- I'd say more likely, uh...
stash them somewhere.

33:58.170 --> 34:01.007
- Well, why would he do that?
- Thermonuclear pits

34:01.040 --> 34:03.009
are designed
to survive a plane crash

34:03.042 --> 34:04.476
without blowing up.

34:04.510 --> 34:07.714
And it would be suicidal

34:07.747 --> 34:11.150
to try to take one of these
apart if you didn't know exactly

34:11.183 --> 34:13.185
what you were doing.

34:15.521 --> 34:17.924
- We've got to find that convoy.

34:33.740 --> 34:37.509
- Still no movement inside?
- Nothing.

34:37.543 --> 34:40.579
- No strigoi have gone in or
come out since the tanker left.

34:40.612 --> 34:43.049
- It's been over two hours.

34:45.217 --> 34:48.187
- I'm going in.
- Wait, you can't be serious.

34:48.220 --> 34:50.222
There could be
a thousand strigs in that place.

34:50.256 --> 34:52.892
- Well, they're probably dead.

34:52.925 --> 34:54.894
- Then why go in?

34:54.927 --> 34:57.696
- Because "probably"
isn't good enough.

34:57.730 --> 34:59.698
- I'm coming with you.

34:59.732 --> 35:01.600
- Really.

35:01.633 --> 35:04.904
- "Probably" isn't good enough
for me either.
