00:02.903 --> 00:05.206
(Beck's "Mixed Bizness" playing)

00:07.675 --> 00:11.712
* I'm mixing business
with leather *

00:11.779 --> 00:15.116
* Christmas with Heather

00:15.183 --> 00:18.252
* Freaks flock together

00:18.319 --> 00:20.821
* Makin' all the B-boys scream *

00:20.888 --> 00:22.290
(camera shutter clicks)

00:22.356 --> 00:23.824
* All right

00:23.891 --> 00:25.593
* All right *

00:25.659 --> 00:27.328
* Turn it up, now

00:27.395 --> 00:28.862
* Turn it up now *

00:28.929 --> 00:30.764
* All right

00:30.831 --> 00:32.766
* All right... *

00:32.833 --> 00:33.867
* Turn it up now

00:33.934 --> 00:36.070
(over PA): Now, at the Sklar
Graphics booth,

00:36.137 --> 00:40.741
Miles Sklar will be unveiling
Ultraworld number one,

00:40.808 --> 00:42.710
the world's rarest and
most valuable comic book.

00:42.776 --> 00:47.581
* I'll comb your hair,
rewrite your diary *

00:47.648 --> 00:48.882
I present...

00:48.949 --> 00:52.786
the long lost, and only copy

00:52.853 --> 00:56.757
of Ultraworld Number One.

00:56.824 --> 00:59.360
(applause, cheering)

00:59.427 --> 01:01.162
* She can look
right through me *

01:01.229 --> 01:04.132
* And make
all the B-boys scream *

01:04.198 --> 01:07.535
And that completes
the greatest

01:07.601 --> 01:10.104
comic book collection
in existence.

01:10.171 --> 01:11.472
(applause, cheering)

01:11.539 --> 01:13.006
MAN (shouting):
Okay, everybody!

01:13.073 --> 01:15.176
On the ground! Now!

01:15.243 --> 01:18.279
(several gunshots)

01:18.346 --> 01:20.714
Open it! Open it!

01:20.781 --> 01:21.849
Do it!
Okay, okay.

01:25.052 --> 01:26.520
Let's go, let's go!

01:26.587 --> 01:28.222
(over walkie-talkie):
What's going on over there?

01:28.289 --> 01:32.226
(gunshots, screaming)

01:32.293 --> 01:36.264
(people screaming)

01:39.867 --> 01:44.071
...how game theory can be
applied to casual relationships.

01:44.138 --> 01:46.006
Between friends,

01:46.073 --> 01:47.341
what's the strategic goal?

01:47.408 --> 01:50.311
After all, there's no commodity
being sought, right?

01:50.378 --> 01:51.812
Let's think
about this.

01:51.879 --> 01:54.648
Even the most
causal relationship

01:54.715 --> 01:58.852
is built around
a very important commodity.

01:58.919 --> 02:00.688
Thank you.

02:00.754 --> 02:02.390
Information.

02:02.456 --> 02:05.459
When a friend shares
information, they place a value

02:05.526 --> 02:08.896
on our intention
not to use it against them.

02:08.962 --> 02:10.398
And we, in turn,

02:10.464 --> 02:13.734
are expected to share
our information with them.

02:13.801 --> 02:16.970
We can call this
symmetrical information,

02:17.037 --> 02:17.838
and it's the foundation

02:17.905 --> 02:20.073
of partnerships
between countries,

02:20.140 --> 02:22.976
corporations,
lovers and friends.

02:23.043 --> 02:24.612
You are very popular.

02:24.678 --> 02:26.414
You have 17
new text messages.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.249
Okay, so for next week,

02:28.316 --> 02:31.452
chapter 15 of Theory of
Games and Economic Behavior

02:31.519 --> 02:33.587
by John von Neumann
and Oskar Morgenstern.

02:33.654 --> 02:36.290
So... you're done.
Thank you all.

02:36.357 --> 02:38.292
Uh, Professor Eppes?

02:38.359 --> 02:40.294
Yeah, hi.
Peter Lange.

02:40.361 --> 02:41.862
Yeah, uh,
biochemistry, right?

02:41.929 --> 02:43.664
Uh, no, uh, Vanity Fair.

02:43.731 --> 02:45.699
I'm writing
a profile on you.

02:45.766 --> 02:47.701
So, um...

02:47.768 --> 02:49.637
have you always
taught game theory?

02:49.703 --> 02:53.106
Uh, yeah, yes.
It's applied mathematics.

02:53.173 --> 02:54.342
I don't always

02:54.408 --> 02:55.576
have this many students.

02:55.643 --> 02:57.110
That's due to the
popularity of the book.

02:57.177 --> 02:58.279
Right.
Oh, I'm also gonna

02:58.346 --> 03:00.781
have to talk to friends
and your family members.

03:00.848 --> 03:02.583
Really?

03:02.650 --> 03:04.017
Well, because
your book,

03:04.084 --> 03:06.854
The Attraction Equation,
is on the best-sellers list,

03:06.920 --> 03:09.457
you're seen as, you know,
a friends expert,

03:09.523 --> 03:11.225
a kind of, uh...
relationship guru.

03:11.292 --> 03:14.695
So I want to know about
your own relationships.

03:17.164 --> 03:18.766
(sirens wailing)

03:18.832 --> 03:21.402
DAVID: Private security guard.
Christopher Jenssen.

03:21.469 --> 03:23.170
Off-duty cop?

03:23.237 --> 03:24.638
High school
football coach.

03:24.705 --> 03:26.807
Wife says he moonlights
to make extra money.

03:26.874 --> 03:29.042
Has four kids, one starts
college next year.

03:29.109 --> 03:30.944
Robber shot Jenssen,

03:31.011 --> 03:33.514
then he fired into the crowd
and hit one.

03:33.581 --> 03:35.516
This is all for
a comic book?

03:35.583 --> 03:36.817
Worth lots of money.

03:36.884 --> 03:38.252
This Sklar has one
of the biggest

03:38.319 --> 03:39.587
comic collections
in the world.

03:39.653 --> 03:42.723
Including the ashcan edition
of Ultraworld number one.

03:42.790 --> 03:44.057
What's the what?

03:44.124 --> 03:45.426
Ashcan edition of a comic,

03:45.493 --> 03:48.095
it's when a publisher,
he only prints one copy,

03:48.161 --> 03:49.363
never intended
for sale.

03:49.430 --> 03:51.832
Often times, it was
thrown in the ashcan.

03:51.899 --> 03:54.001
This one in particular,
the one that was stolen,

03:54.067 --> 03:56.604
was drawn in 1962 by Ross Moore.

03:56.670 --> 03:57.638
He's a visionary.

03:57.705 --> 03:58.972
He's a legendary artist.

03:59.039 --> 04:00.674
How do you know all this?

04:00.741 --> 04:01.609
(chuckles)

04:01.675 --> 04:03.043
I started my first collection
when I was nine.

04:03.110 --> 04:05.045
I still have a few thousand.

04:05.112 --> 04:06.146
Aha.

04:06.213 --> 04:07.548
A comic book geek in the FBI.

04:07.615 --> 04:09.049
Sweet.

04:09.116 --> 04:10.318
Oh, man.

04:10.384 --> 04:11.752
Absolute pleasure
to meet you, man.

04:11.819 --> 04:13.020
I'm a big fan
of your work.

04:13.086 --> 04:15.589
I have a first edition
of NanoPunk. Mint.

04:15.656 --> 04:18.426
Oh, yeah? Well, I'm a big fan
of your work, too.

04:18.492 --> 04:20.227
Bank robberies and stuff.

04:20.294 --> 04:21.395
(chuckles)

04:21.462 --> 04:22.396
Don, this Seth Marlowe.

04:22.463 --> 04:23.931
He's an incredible artist,

04:23.997 --> 04:26.099
and he's also an expert
in comic history.

04:26.166 --> 04:27.000
Ah...

04:27.067 --> 04:28.402
You know this guy Miles Sklar?

04:28.469 --> 04:29.937
Oh, yeah, yeah.

04:30.003 --> 04:31.171
He is, uh, everything
that's wrong

04:31.238 --> 04:32.205
with the comic book industry.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.541
How's that?

04:33.607 --> 04:35.409
He started out
as a promising young artist,

04:35.476 --> 04:37.845
but he said that there
wasn't enough money

04:37.911 --> 04:40.914
in comic books, and so
he created a character

04:40.981 --> 04:43.183
that he would sell to TV
and, uh, the toy companies,

04:43.250 --> 04:44.284
and he made millions.

04:44.352 --> 04:46.086
What would you say this...
What is it?

04:46.153 --> 04:47.287
Ultraworld number one.

04:47.355 --> 04:48.088
What's that worth?

04:48.155 --> 04:50.223
Uh, maybe $2 million.

04:50.290 --> 04:53.026
If it's actually
authentic.

04:53.093 --> 04:54.628
He never had it authenticated?

04:54.695 --> 04:56.397
So, what, you're saying
it could be fake?

04:56.464 --> 04:57.765
Yeah.

04:57.831 --> 05:00.468
If it's real, it belongs to the
guy who created it, Ross Moore.

05:00.534 --> 05:03.437
business.legend in this

05:03.504 --> 05:04.972
Ross Moore, that hack?

05:05.038 --> 05:07.107
Yeah, he wrote it--
decades ago.

05:07.174 --> 05:11.311
Look, he sold it,
he lost it, whatever.

05:11.379 --> 05:13.146
I paid for it,
so it's mine.

05:13.213 --> 05:16.517
He can't come around now asking
for it because it's valuable.

05:16.584 --> 05:18.386
- How did you get it?
- I found it.

05:18.452 --> 05:21.722
It was at an estate sale
in Syracuse, New York.

05:21.789 --> 05:24.224
It was in a box
with 300 other comics.

05:24.291 --> 05:27.961
And you got it
for an investment?

05:28.028 --> 05:29.296
Yes, I will sell it

05:29.363 --> 05:31.198
when it's at its peak value,

05:31.264 --> 05:33.333
which should be
right after Moore dies.

05:33.401 --> 05:34.835
He's not doing
very well,

05:34.902 --> 05:36.504
so that shouldn't be very long.

05:36.570 --> 05:37.905
Nice for you, I guess.

05:37.971 --> 05:40.307
Comics are a business.

05:40.374 --> 05:42.976
I'm rich because
I understand that.

05:43.043 --> 05:45.312
And this was the first time
it was shown?

05:45.379 --> 05:47.280
Yes. I normally keep it in
an undisclosed location

05:47.347 --> 05:48.749
in a locked safe.

05:48.816 --> 05:50.183
I only brought it
to the convention

05:50.250 --> 05:51.985
because there were
these rumors that it's fake.

05:53.086 --> 05:55.456
In retrospect, a bad idea.

05:57.324 --> 05:59.827
MEGAN:
Talk about arrested development.

05:59.893 --> 06:01.629
You can't deny
the cultural impact

06:01.695 --> 06:03.330
that comics have had
on this country.

06:03.397 --> 06:05.332
You got Lichtenstein, Warhol...

06:05.399 --> 06:07.267
Hugh Jackman in a
Wolverine outfit--

06:07.334 --> 06:08.502
that was hot.

06:08.569 --> 06:10.771
Agent Sinclair!
There's a wild rumor

06:10.838 --> 06:13.441
that Ultraworld just sold
on the black market

06:13.507 --> 06:15.042
for 50,000 bucks.

06:15.108 --> 06:16.276
What? Who bought it?

06:16.343 --> 06:18.846
MAN: Who says they bought it?
That's impossible.

06:18.912 --> 06:20.247
- How would you know?
- Because I know.

06:20.313 --> 06:21.915
Hey, sir? FBI.

06:21.982 --> 06:23.350
We need to speak
to you for a second.

06:23.417 --> 06:24.418
Uh, I don't know anything.

06:24.485 --> 06:25.853
He didn't ask you
anything yet.

06:25.919 --> 06:28.522
Three guys are fighting
over there-- they all say

06:28.589 --> 06:30.658
they bought Ultraworld.
- No way! I...

06:30.724 --> 06:32.893
You what?
Let me see your hands.

06:36.329 --> 06:37.631
Oh, God.

06:37.698 --> 06:40.133
There's copies
everywhere.

06:42.202 --> 06:45.573
So much for our rare
one-of-kind comic.

06:57.985 --> 07:01.088
So people bought a stolen comic,
even though a man died.

07:01.154 --> 07:03.691
That's just obsessive
collecting.

07:03.757 --> 07:04.858
Three hours after
the robbery,

07:04.925 --> 07:06.727
buyers got an e-mail
from someone claiming

07:06.794 --> 07:09.963
to have acquired the actual
comic from the robbers.

07:10.030 --> 07:11.699
Mm, hey there.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.934
- You with us?
- Yeah. What?

07:14.001 --> 07:15.435
I mean...

07:15.503 --> 07:16.770
How did the buys go down?

07:16.837 --> 07:19.773
It was cash only, ranging from
five to 40,000 dollars.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.909
The seller met with buyers
over a six-hour period,

07:21.975 --> 07:23.711
each at a different
public place.

07:23.777 --> 07:26.379
General description
is a white guy, mid-20s.

07:26.446 --> 07:27.648
MEGAN: Is there any chance that
the real one

07:27.715 --> 07:29.483
was sold along with the fakes?

07:29.550 --> 07:31.151
Tech said all the copies
are of similar quality,

07:31.218 --> 07:32.486
all done in old paper.

07:32.553 --> 07:34.655
But because Sklar never
had his authenticated,

07:34.722 --> 07:35.789
there's no way of knowing

07:35.856 --> 07:37.057
if it's the real Ultraworld
number one.

07:37.124 --> 07:39.226
Well, someone thought
it was worth killing for.

07:39.292 --> 07:40.828
MEGAN: You know, that shooter

07:40.894 --> 07:43.564
reacted to minor
resistance with rage.

07:43.631 --> 07:45.599
Maybe there's
an aggression disorder.

07:45.666 --> 07:47.234
There'd probably be
a violent record.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.101
Yeah, and check it out.

07:48.168 --> 07:49.570
Those locations are

07:49.637 --> 07:50.671
pretty evenly
spaced, huh?

07:50.738 --> 07:51.739
We know what that means.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.240
Somebody tried to make them

07:53.306 --> 07:54.808
look random, but they're not.

07:54.875 --> 07:56.443
Yeah, why don't you
run it by Charlie?

07:56.510 --> 07:57.578
All right.

07:57.645 --> 08:00.113
You doing okay?

08:00.180 --> 08:03.050
Yeah.

08:04.284 --> 08:05.553
CHARLIE:
So the fakes were sold

08:05.619 --> 08:07.588
at 14 locations
within a five-mile radius.

08:07.655 --> 08:08.922
Well, that's
excellent,

08:08.989 --> 08:11.191
because I can get you a probable
base for the seller.

08:11.258 --> 08:12.793
All right, how about
the copies themselves?

08:12.860 --> 08:14.027
Dude, I love
forgery problems,

08:14.094 --> 08:15.563
because I can
compare the copies,

08:15.629 --> 08:17.164
see if they're drawn
by the same person.

08:17.230 --> 08:19.032
I just wish I knew more
about comic books.

08:19.099 --> 08:20.768
Well, you've come
to the right place.

08:20.834 --> 08:24.237
Hey, you're the, uh,
FBI math guy.

08:24.304 --> 08:25.105
Yeah, yeah, that's me.

08:25.172 --> 08:26.506
I've been getting a lot
of press.

08:26.574 --> 08:27.507
I'm Charles Eppes.

08:27.575 --> 08:28.408
Seth Marlowe.

08:28.475 --> 08:29.877
All right, Seth.

08:29.943 --> 08:32.212
And I guess you're an expert
on comic collecting and history.

08:32.279 --> 08:34.181
And I see that you're
an artist yourself.

08:34.247 --> 08:36.516
Yeah, these are my people.

08:38.619 --> 08:39.452
(chuckling):
All right.

08:39.519 --> 08:40.754
What do you want to know?

08:40.821 --> 08:42.222
What makes
a comic valuable?

08:42.289 --> 08:44.792
Rarity, age and condition.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.994
Which is why a lot of collectors
don't even read them.

08:47.060 --> 08:49.429
They just buy them
and seal them up.

08:49.496 --> 08:50.898
The book's condition.

08:50.964 --> 08:54.602
This one's mint, perfect.
Never been read.

08:54.668 --> 08:56.937
And now it never
will be.

08:57.004 --> 08:58.471
It's only good
for showing off.

08:58.538 --> 09:02.275
And, uh, what does this...
this yellow sticker mean?

09:02.342 --> 09:04.845
That it's been doctored.
Cuts the value.

09:04.912 --> 09:06.279
People paint
faded copies,

09:06.346 --> 09:07.314
spray them
with cooking oil

09:07.380 --> 09:09.617
to make them shiny,
use tape on smudges,

09:09.683 --> 09:11.151
which takes off
some of the original ink.

09:11.218 --> 09:13.120
How about forgery,
is that common?

09:13.186 --> 09:14.287
If you're good enough
to fake a comic,

09:14.354 --> 09:15.623
you're good enough
to be drawing your own.

09:15.689 --> 09:17.625
CHARLIE: Highly rare comic is
valuable,

09:17.691 --> 09:19.793
that'd be motivation
for forgery?

09:19.860 --> 09:21.995
Rare ones are well-known
to the collectors.

09:22.062 --> 09:25.465
All right, so all I'll need
is copies of Ross Moore's work

09:25.532 --> 09:28.836
drawn around the same time that
he drew Ultraworld number one.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.137
You know Ross Moore?

09:30.203 --> 09:34.107
He's a friend.
I'll talk to him.

09:37.244 --> 09:38.679
MOORE:
That's the old stuff you want.

09:38.746 --> 09:40.213
That's from 1962.

09:40.280 --> 09:43.851
Two weeks after I drew
Ultraworld one.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.686
It's exactly
what we need.

09:45.753 --> 09:47.655
Thank you so much.

09:47.721 --> 09:49.757
How are you feeling today, Ross?

09:49.823 --> 09:51.158
(groans)
All right, as long as

09:51.224 --> 09:53.694
I don't try to do
anything too fast.

09:53.761 --> 09:56.396
I got emphysema,
kidney problems...

09:56.463 --> 09:57.698
I beat the big "C"

09:57.765 --> 09:59.232
a couple years ago.

09:59.299 --> 10:01.669
Mr. Moore,
it's a real honor.

10:01.735 --> 10:03.203
I've always loved
your books.

10:03.270 --> 10:04.504
I own a lot of them.

10:04.571 --> 10:06.006
Probably more than I do.

10:06.073 --> 10:09.442
I sold most of my collection,
years ago.

10:09.509 --> 10:10.343
Hey, you had no way of knowing

10:10.410 --> 10:11.845
how crazy the market
was going to get.

10:11.912 --> 10:14.381
Threw old books out.
Gave them away.

10:14.447 --> 10:21.221
We left behind boxes of
stuff when we moved offices.

10:21.288 --> 10:23.223
I didn't mean to lose
Ultraworld,

10:23.290 --> 10:27.027
but somewhere back then,
it got misplaced.

10:27.094 --> 10:29.562
I'd sure like to have it back.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.231
Why that one?

10:31.298 --> 10:33.400
Well... Iris...

10:33.466 --> 10:37.637
supported me when I
was getting started,

10:37.705 --> 10:40.040
stuck with me
all this time.

10:40.107 --> 10:44.044
With my health problems,
we're pretty broke.

10:44.111 --> 10:46.379
But after I'm gone,

10:46.446 --> 10:50.250
she could sell it,
live well the rest of her life.

10:50.317 --> 10:52.419
And that'll happen.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.554
If there's any justice
in this world.

10:54.621 --> 10:56.990
Huh... justice?

10:57.057 --> 11:00.393
Kid, you read
too many comic books.

11:05.432 --> 11:07.334
Charlie's sending over
a hot zone map

11:07.400 --> 11:09.569
so we can target
the seller's locations.

11:09.636 --> 11:10.603
That's great.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.539
You asked for these
files from Karen Silver

11:12.605 --> 11:14.241
in the Art Crime Unit?

11:14.307 --> 11:19.046
Um, yeah, it's just some stuff
on known forgers in the area.

11:19.112 --> 11:20.047
Mm.

11:20.113 --> 11:21.982
Hey, what do you
know about Karen?

11:22.049 --> 11:23.817
Does she, uh...
she got a boyfriend?

11:23.884 --> 11:25.252
What's her story?

11:25.318 --> 11:26.553
She's married.

11:26.619 --> 11:27.888
Oh, really?

11:30.690 --> 11:32.592
Why? You looking
to meet someone?

11:32.659 --> 11:35.362
You know, it's just back
in Idaho

11:35.428 --> 11:37.597
it was pretty easy
to meet girls.

11:37.664 --> 11:38.465
Knew just about everybody

11:38.531 --> 11:40.333
who lived in the town
where I grew up.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.102
I know some
pretty interesting women.

11:42.169 --> 11:45.906
Hmm, I'm sure you do.
Smart, successful,

11:45.973 --> 11:47.074
great sense of humor,

11:47.140 --> 11:50.043
but you'll leave out
"big-boned, owns 17 cats."

11:50.110 --> 11:53.346
I will bet you 20 bucks
I can set you up

11:53.413 --> 11:54.882
with someone
and you'll like it.

11:54.948 --> 11:58.886
20 bucks?
All right, you're on.

11:58.952 --> 12:00.453
ALAN:
You know what I really liked?

12:00.520 --> 12:02.790
I loved those Fabulous
Furry Freak Brothers

12:02.856 --> 12:06.794
or anything by R. Crumb
or Harvey Pekar.

12:06.860 --> 12:09.596
Yeah? Me, no,
I wanted adventure.

12:09.662 --> 12:11.799
The quest for cosmic answers.

12:11.865 --> 12:13.533
Oh, you were
into superheroes.

12:13.600 --> 12:16.736
Well, Daredevil, Fantastic Four.

12:16.804 --> 12:18.305
Of course, my favorite
was Galactus.

12:18.371 --> 12:20.974
That's the guy
who ate planets.

12:21.041 --> 12:23.510
Yeah, well, he was
stellar Darwinism.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.712
He was necessary to the survival
of the universe.

12:25.779 --> 12:26.847
Huh?

12:26.914 --> 12:29.749
Yeah, he was the third force
along with eternity and death.

12:29.817 --> 12:31.584
Larry, he wanted
to eat the Earth.

12:31.651 --> 12:34.354
But he didn't.

12:34.421 --> 12:36.589
Hey, David,
I found a printing house

12:36.656 --> 12:38.125
that deals in
vintage paper.

12:38.191 --> 12:40.427
They had a request
for '50s-era pulp paper.

12:40.493 --> 12:41.728
That's what the forgeries
are printed on.

12:41.795 --> 12:44.231
Yeah, and the guy used a fake
name and paid cash,

12:44.297 --> 12:46.967
but I got a description,
and he was wearing

12:47.034 --> 12:48.168
a Dr. Strange T-shirt.

12:48.235 --> 12:50.303
"By the hoary hosts
of Hoggoth!"

12:50.370 --> 12:51.371
What?

12:51.438 --> 12:53.974
Uh, Dr. Strange's
catchphrase.

12:54.041 --> 12:56.676
You know, when
he'd use... Yeah.

12:56.743 --> 12:59.179
Charlie's map shows
an area that's central

12:59.246 --> 13:00.713
to all the forgery sales.

13:00.780 --> 13:03.050
All right,
we can run down records

13:03.116 --> 13:04.784
of all the male residents
in the area.

13:04.852 --> 13:05.986
Might not need to.

13:06.053 --> 13:07.587
I checked out the businesses
in the hot zone.

13:07.654 --> 13:09.589
There's a comic book
store right there.

13:09.656 --> 13:10.690
So I called to see

13:10.757 --> 13:11.959
if there was any unusual
activity recently.

13:12.025 --> 13:13.560
Like the way
you're thinking.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.562
Day after the robbery,
a guy walked in,

13:15.628 --> 13:18.098
he bought $20,000 worth
of collectible comic books.

13:18.165 --> 13:20.433
He was wearing
a Dr. Strange T-shirt.

13:20.500 --> 13:22.903
Same as the guy who bought
the vintage-era paper.

13:22.970 --> 13:24.437
Yep. He might
be trying to launder

13:24.504 --> 13:25.939
the money from the
forgery sales.

13:26.006 --> 13:27.474
This guy a regular
customer?

13:27.540 --> 13:28.909
The kind they might
know by name?

13:28.976 --> 13:32.045
He's the kind that puts in
in an order for more books.

13:32.112 --> 13:33.046
You're kidding me.

13:33.113 --> 13:34.781
So they not only
know his name...

13:34.848 --> 13:37.117
...they have his
home phone number.

13:45.692 --> 13:47.527
(knocking)

13:49.462 --> 13:51.264
I think I hear
water running.

13:51.331 --> 13:53.666
MAN:
Gentlemen, I'm in the shower!

13:53.733 --> 13:54.734
(glass breaks)

13:54.801 --> 13:57.237
He's going out
the back.

14:14.087 --> 14:16.089
Man, who's gonna
tackle this guy?

14:16.156 --> 14:18.191
Whoever gets there last.

14:29.669 --> 14:32.672
Hey, give me the keys
to your car now!

14:37.978 --> 14:40.213
(blows landing)

14:41.714 --> 14:43.816
(suspect groaning)

14:43.883 --> 14:44.817
Ladies, ladies, FBI!

14:44.884 --> 14:47.487
Please, let him go, okay?

14:47.554 --> 14:48.055
Please, let him go.

14:48.121 --> 14:49.656
Thank you.

14:49.722 --> 14:53.160
You dropped your
cape, Super Boy.

15:02.369 --> 15:04.837
So we know you bought
vintage paper.

15:04.904 --> 15:07.474
Same paper you used to make the
forgeries of Ultraworld #1.

15:07.540 --> 15:09.842
It's not a crime to buy paper.

15:09.909 --> 15:12.079
You don't have anything else.

15:12.145 --> 15:15.148
How about indecent exposure?

15:16.516 --> 15:17.584
What?

15:17.650 --> 15:19.186
Naked carjacking.

15:20.087 --> 15:22.055
It's the worst kind.

15:22.122 --> 15:24.391
Mark Vaughn, gentlemen,
classic con personality,

15:24.457 --> 15:26.726
goes along with the mail fraud
and the scams.

15:26.793 --> 15:28.295
Yeah? You think robbery?

15:28.361 --> 15:30.497
Yes, but he's not our shooter.

15:30.563 --> 15:32.966
He knows how
to control his emotions.

15:33.033 --> 15:33.900
He's not our forger.

15:33.967 --> 15:34.467
He's got no background in art.

15:34.534 --> 15:36.469
I'm kinda thinking
he might be on a team,

15:36.536 --> 15:37.470
maybe two other people.

15:37.537 --> 15:39.406
Right, maybe one's an artist...

15:39.472 --> 15:41.308
...and the other's the killer.

15:41.374 --> 15:42.609
Yeah, so we run down
his associates,

15:42.675 --> 15:43.810
look for the trigger-happy
psycho?

15:43.876 --> 15:45.612
Yeah, that sounds good.

15:45.678 --> 15:47.380
Thanks, guys.

15:49.382 --> 15:52.285
Anybody else think Don's been
a little off these days?

15:52.352 --> 15:54.921
Kinda hard to say,
but maybe a little.

15:54.988 --> 15:56.689
Especially since
he broke up with Liz.

15:56.756 --> 15:58.191
Maybe one of us should go and...

15:58.258 --> 16:00.527
you know, see if he wants
to talk about it.

16:00.593 --> 16:01.094
You volunteering?

16:01.161 --> 16:02.029
Hell, no.

16:02.095 --> 16:03.596
(laughs)

16:05.432 --> 16:07.600
I'd spent my entire life
with comic-book art,

16:07.667 --> 16:08.601
especially Ross Moore's

16:08.668 --> 16:10.603
and I can't tell
if this is real or not.

16:10.670 --> 16:13.773
Well, that's 'cause what you do
is you look at the style,

16:13.840 --> 16:14.907
the form of drawing techniques.

16:14.974 --> 16:16.609
Silly me.
What do you do?

16:16.676 --> 16:17.644
Fractal number estimate.

16:17.710 --> 16:21.281
It's based on Mandelbrot's
use of fractal dimension

16:21.348 --> 16:24.517
to measure the jaggedness
of a coastline.

16:24.584 --> 16:26.419
So what's going on
in here?

16:26.486 --> 16:27.587
Oh, hello.

16:27.654 --> 16:31.024
Other than a very hot woman
looking very hot?

16:31.091 --> 16:36.396
Charlie, I'm sorry,
I've been swept off my feet.

16:36.463 --> 16:39.599
I'm going to have to run off
with this man

16:39.666 --> 16:40.900
because he is so smooth.

16:40.967 --> 16:42.569
Oh, you mock me.

16:42.635 --> 16:43.803
Seriously,
what are you doing?

16:43.870 --> 16:46.806
I am using
the fractal-dimension analysis

16:46.873 --> 16:51.444
to evaluate the wrinkliness
of these lines.

16:51.511 --> 16:52.545
The wrinkliness?

16:52.612 --> 16:55.482
An authentic piece of
handwriting or drawing

16:55.548 --> 16:59.452
will have a smoother ink edge
than one that is forged.

16:59.519 --> 17:03.056
So for instance,
when I sign my own name,

17:03.123 --> 17:05.625
the pen moves quite rapidly.

17:05.692 --> 17:08.027
The movements of my hand
are fast and fluid,

17:08.095 --> 17:11.098
thus minimizing the contact
between paper and pen.

17:11.164 --> 17:12.399
The faster the hand movement,

17:12.465 --> 17:14.334
the smoother the edge
of the ink.

17:14.401 --> 17:16.636
However, when someone copies
my signature,

17:16.703 --> 17:18.571
it's an imitation
of my movement.

17:18.638 --> 17:20.907
It's not as natural for the
forger, so it's slower.

17:20.973 --> 17:22.275
The slower the pen,

17:22.342 --> 17:24.344
the longer the contact
with the paper,

17:24.411 --> 17:27.080
the more time for ink to be
absorbed into the paper

17:27.147 --> 17:30.583
which creates an irregular
or wrinkly edge.

17:30.650 --> 17:33.586
Fractal dimension allows us
to compare the wrinkliness

17:33.653 --> 17:34.821
and detect the fake.

17:34.887 --> 17:37.990
These fractal comparisons
are telling us the same thing.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.726
That none of the copies
we analyze

17:39.792 --> 17:40.827
were drawn by Ross Moore.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.329
Yet there are
similarities

17:42.395 --> 17:44.897
across multiple points
of edge comparison.

17:44.964 --> 17:46.533
Which means?

17:46.599 --> 17:48.501
The same artist drew
all the forgeries.

17:48.568 --> 17:50.203
And we can try
to match

17:50.270 --> 17:51.238
the forger's style

17:51.304 --> 17:54.341
to a specific comic book
artist if you can get us samples

17:54.407 --> 17:56.276
of artists that are capable
of copying Ross Moore.

17:56.343 --> 18:01.781
He did inspire an entire
generation of artists,

18:01.848 --> 18:03.583
but, uh, yeah,

18:03.650 --> 18:06.953
I-I can help you
round up the usual suspects.

18:07.019 --> 18:08.588
Great.

18:08.655 --> 18:13.126
This guy you got, Mark Vaughn,
he's your basic grifter.

18:13.193 --> 18:15.128
Any real bad guys he knows

18:15.195 --> 18:17.096
he met courtesy of the state
of California.

18:17.164 --> 18:17.997
In prison.

18:18.064 --> 18:19.366
During a stint
a couple years ago,

18:19.432 --> 18:19.966
he bought protection

18:20.032 --> 18:22.001
from Gordon Garrity, 44.

18:22.068 --> 18:23.102
A real sweetie.

18:23.170 --> 18:24.671
Armed robbery,
home invasion,

18:24.737 --> 18:27.807
assault with intent,
voluntary manslaughter.

18:27.874 --> 18:28.675
I ran a check for you.

18:28.741 --> 18:29.976
He skipped two parole
appointments.

18:30.042 --> 18:31.278
There's a warrant out.

18:31.344 --> 18:33.580
Well, thanks very much.

18:33.646 --> 18:35.615
Thanks for running the check.

18:35.682 --> 18:36.683
Appreciate it.

18:39.986 --> 18:42.489
This guy is not going
to be easy to find.

18:42.555 --> 18:43.823
Doesn't sound like it.

18:43.890 --> 18:45.892
But, um,
what about her?

18:45.958 --> 18:47.427
She your type?

18:51.498 --> 18:53.600
Of course,
form flourished

18:53.666 --> 18:55.602
all through
the '30s and '40s,

18:55.668 --> 18:56.869
particularly
during World War II, you know,

18:56.936 --> 18:59.439
when people felt so
frightened and futureless.

18:59.506 --> 19:01.774
The comic book heroes
embodied the hope

19:01.841 --> 19:03.643
that good would triumph,

19:03.710 --> 19:05.812
power was in the hands
of the right.

19:05.878 --> 19:08.315
With great power comes
great responsibility.

19:08.381 --> 19:10.283
That's right,
and the way of the hero

19:10.350 --> 19:12.819
is the path
of self-sacrifice.

19:12.885 --> 19:15.322
CHARLIE: Hey, Seth, you got
anything for us?

19:15.388 --> 19:17.089
Yes, sir.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.292
These are all
done by artists

19:19.359 --> 19:22.229
who could draw like Ross Moore
if they wanted to.

19:22.295 --> 19:23.563
Oh, it's surely not
Harry Hoodle.

19:23.630 --> 19:25.265
Come on. I've read
all his books.

19:25.332 --> 19:27.234
This is all based
on drawing style.

19:27.300 --> 19:28.968
Look, man, I'm
giving you stuff

19:29.035 --> 19:31.471
from some
of my best friends here.

19:32.639 --> 19:34.341
I see you bought my book.

19:34.407 --> 19:35.342
Oh, yeah, yeah.

19:35.408 --> 19:36.676
You want to sign it for me?

19:36.743 --> 19:37.910
Might be worth something
someday.

19:37.977 --> 19:40.112
Yeah. I'll tell you what.
I'll sign one of mine

19:40.179 --> 19:41.113
if you sign one of yours
for me.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.516
How about a NanoPunk?

19:43.583 --> 19:46.085
Cool.

19:46.152 --> 19:47.787
LARRY: You know that magazine
writer called me?

19:47.854 --> 19:49.856
Do you think
I should talk to him?

19:49.922 --> 19:51.691
Oh. Both my publisher

19:51.758 --> 19:54.026
and my publicist think
you should.

19:54.093 --> 19:55.228
Yeah, but do you?

19:55.295 --> 19:57.664
Larry, it was never
my intent to go down

19:57.730 --> 19:59.766
in history as
some crackpot expert.

19:59.832 --> 20:00.967
There's something
to be said

20:01.033 --> 20:02.502
for being an expert.

20:02.569 --> 20:04.604
So, have you found
your mystery forger?

20:04.671 --> 20:05.872
No, not yet.

20:05.938 --> 20:07.707
There's still
a lot of artists to test.

20:07.774 --> 20:11.811
I think you should
consider economics.

20:11.878 --> 20:13.780
What was the result

20:13.846 --> 20:15.782
of the robbery
and the forgeries?

20:15.848 --> 20:18.851
Uh, somebody made money
on those forgeries

20:18.918 --> 20:20.086
and at this point,

20:20.152 --> 20:22.889
Sklar's copy has been
totally discredited.

20:22.955 --> 20:25.792
So fake books, a real book.

20:25.858 --> 20:28.495
Now, what does economic theory
say about the value

20:28.561 --> 20:32.332
of false goods commingled
with genuine.

20:32.399 --> 20:34.567
Genuine goods lose value, right?

20:34.634 --> 20:36.769
Okay, so putting our thinking
caps on here,

20:36.836 --> 20:42.642
who would want to devalue
Ultraworld and discredit Sklar?

20:47.314 --> 20:49.682
I think I know whose art
I need to analyze next.

20:52.118 --> 20:55.322
(crowd cheering over TV)

20:58.190 --> 20:59.191
Hey.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.627
Oh!

21:00.693 --> 21:03.930
Hey, I know
who the forger is.

21:03.996 --> 21:05.998
Yeah.

21:06.065 --> 21:07.099
It's Seth Marlowe.

21:07.166 --> 21:09.135
Yeah? Can you prove that?

21:09.201 --> 21:10.870
No, but I have a theory.

21:10.937 --> 21:13.440
And it's far too elegant
not to be true.

21:23.616 --> 21:25.184
It's elegant
because it all fits.

21:25.251 --> 21:26.486
It's not just
about theft,

21:26.553 --> 21:27.887
it's about making
people doubt

21:27.954 --> 21:29.622
that Sklar's
Ultraworld was real.

21:29.689 --> 21:31.858
Well, we know
that Seth hates Miles Sklar.

21:31.924 --> 21:33.860
Right, and if
Sklar's was fake,

21:33.926 --> 21:36.696
then he can't claim the real one
when it shows up,

21:36.763 --> 21:37.764
and it will.

21:37.830 --> 21:39.799
You think the real one
is in Seth's possession?

21:39.866 --> 21:41.801
He's gonna try and make his
ownership look legitimate?

21:41.868 --> 21:43.370
He didn't steal it
for himself.

21:43.436 --> 21:45.838
He wants to give it
to Ross Moore.

21:45.905 --> 21:47.807
Charlie's telling me
his theory on Seth Marlowe.

21:47.874 --> 21:48.641
It's "elegant."

21:48.708 --> 21:49.876
Yeah, I know all about it,

21:49.942 --> 21:51.544
but he doesn't have any proof.
It's a hunch.

21:51.611 --> 21:53.012
You have hunches.
You follow them.

21:53.079 --> 21:54.180
Yeah, well, Charlie,
you know, look,

21:54.246 --> 21:56.015
we don't exactly think of you
as our hunch guy.

21:56.082 --> 21:59.285
Hey, you know, I had a hunch
about the Eppes Convergence

21:59.352 --> 22:00.520
way before
I had the math.

22:00.587 --> 22:02.355
Einstein had a hunch
about relativity

22:02.422 --> 22:04.056
decades before
it could be proven.

22:04.123 --> 22:05.091
Hey, I don't want to get

22:05.157 --> 22:06.926
in the middle of
a brother thing here,

22:06.993 --> 22:07.960
but, um, do you want
my professional opinion?

22:08.027 --> 22:10.229
- Of course.
- Seth doesn't fit the profile.

22:10.296 --> 22:11.531
He has no
criminal record.

22:11.598 --> 22:12.799
He's a really
well-known artist.

22:12.865 --> 22:14.801
He's a historian, a collector.

22:14.867 --> 22:16.869
He stands more to lose
than he stands to gain.

22:16.936 --> 22:18.905
Those are both excellent
professional opinions

22:18.971 --> 22:20.940
to consider, however once
considered...

22:21.007 --> 22:24.043
they don't change my hunch,
but thank you.

22:25.445 --> 22:26.546
Hunch.

22:26.613 --> 22:27.947
Gordon Garrity,

22:28.014 --> 22:29.782
our robber's prison buddy--
he's not turning up.

22:29.849 --> 22:31.350
We're going through
his known associates

22:31.418 --> 22:33.319
trying to put together
a geographical map

22:33.386 --> 22:34.320
of his past crimes.

22:34.387 --> 22:35.888
So, what's Charlie got?

22:35.955 --> 22:38.124
Elegance, no proof.

22:45.131 --> 22:46.466
Uh, excuse me.

22:46.533 --> 22:47.634
I'm Peter Lange.

22:47.700 --> 22:48.668
Yes.

22:48.735 --> 22:50.202
I'm writing the piece
on Charles Eppes.

22:50.269 --> 22:53.105
I was unaware that Vanity Fair
has a mathematics section.

22:53.172 --> 22:54.441
LANGE:
Well, we don't.

22:54.507 --> 22:56.976
Culture, society,
media, celebrity--

22:57.043 --> 22:58.911
where Professor Eppes
now finds himself.

22:58.978 --> 22:59.979
Around here,

23:00.046 --> 23:02.014
he was famous before
he wrote the book.

23:02.081 --> 23:04.784
I, uh...

23:04.851 --> 23:08.821
I want to write about...
you and his other friends.

23:08.888 --> 23:12.892
Okay, well,
he's well-liked on campus.

23:12.959 --> 23:14.093
- Wherever he goes...
- Yeah, I know,

23:14.160 --> 23:16.128
he's the most popular
professor on campus,

23:16.195 --> 23:18.998
but he has few close friends.

23:19.065 --> 23:21.601
A former teacher,
a former student.

23:21.668 --> 23:23.169
Yeah, well,

23:23.235 --> 23:24.671
I think he just
chooses to live

23:24.737 --> 23:27.039
by Benjamin Franklin's
old adage:

23:27.106 --> 23:28.808
"Be civil to all,

23:28.875 --> 23:31.944
social with many,
known to few."

23:32.011 --> 23:34.447
Few. Being... two?

23:35.748 --> 23:36.749
Come on.

23:36.816 --> 23:40.086
You know, I was a total geek
in high school.

23:40.152 --> 23:41.387
I know what it's like.

23:41.454 --> 23:43.222
You know, Charlie's passionate
about the world,

23:43.289 --> 23:46.959
but he thinks about it in terms
of numbers and patterns.

23:47.026 --> 23:48.695
How many people
can he share that with?

23:48.761 --> 23:50.062
Other mathematicians?

23:50.129 --> 23:53.332
Yeah, but few of us started
college at 13.

23:53.399 --> 23:56.068
Charlie wasn't part
of a social peer group

23:56.135 --> 23:57.036
until he was an adult.

23:57.103 --> 23:58.471
So the fact that
he's as compassionate

23:58.538 --> 24:00.707
and engaged as any of us...

24:00.773 --> 24:02.942
I mean, I think that's his
greatest accomplishment.

24:11.250 --> 24:13.953
Hey, Seth,

24:14.020 --> 24:15.755
this is Charlie.

24:15.822 --> 24:18.625
Charlie, yeah,
we... we know each other.

24:18.691 --> 24:21.528
He's helping the
FBI find Ultraworld.

24:21.594 --> 24:22.795
Trying to.

24:22.862 --> 24:25.097
Yeah, you've been great.

24:25.164 --> 24:27.700
So, um...

24:27.767 --> 24:30.036
what brings you here?

24:30.102 --> 24:32.371
I could use a couple more
samples of Ross' work.

24:32.438 --> 24:35.307
I wanted to meet the man
everybody's talking about.

24:35.374 --> 24:40.479
These kids today, they make too
much about us old guys.

24:40.547 --> 24:42.515
We were just trying
to make a little money,

24:42.582 --> 24:44.751
have some fun.

24:44.817 --> 24:47.119
You created
a new art form.

24:47.186 --> 24:48.855
What, comic books?

24:49.689 --> 24:51.958
What's all this?

24:52.024 --> 24:54.193
This guy, always
bringing stuff.

24:56.362 --> 25:00.700
Seth, I don't know what Iris and
I would do without you.

25:00.767 --> 25:03.069
You give us so much
of your time.

25:03.135 --> 25:06.939
I know you've got
more important things to do.

25:07.006 --> 25:09.241
No, not more important
than this.

25:16.182 --> 25:17.383
You guys, we found
something on Garrity.

25:17.449 --> 25:19.385
Let me guess-- he's a fan of
comic books.

25:19.451 --> 25:20.419
Yeah. How'd you know?

25:20.486 --> 25:22.021
'Cause I was just
telling Don

25:22.088 --> 25:23.823
that some of Seth Marlowe's
fans live in state prisons.

25:23.890 --> 25:25.925
And they write their favorite
comic book artists letters.

25:25.992 --> 25:27.493
Yeah, we found the same link.

25:27.560 --> 25:29.128
Garrity wrote a letter
a year ago--

25:29.195 --> 25:31.130
sent it from the
High Desert State Prison

25:31.197 --> 25:32.098
to Seth Marlowe.

25:32.164 --> 25:33.766
Right, well, I'm sure the guy

25:33.833 --> 25:35.134
gets a thousand of these a year.

25:35.201 --> 25:36.836
Yeah, but how many of them
are from inmates?

25:36.903 --> 25:38.104
And how many
are from guys

25:38.170 --> 25:40.306
who have a direct connection
to Mark Vaughn?

25:43.042 --> 25:45.111
SETH: What do I think of
Miles Sklar?

25:45.177 --> 25:48.681
I think he got a
mega-dose of vitamin K.

25:48.748 --> 25:50.016
K for Karma.

25:50.082 --> 25:50.917
(laughing)

25:50.983 --> 25:52.985
Parades around
claiming he owns

25:53.052 --> 25:55.722
Ultraworld #1--

25:55.788 --> 25:57.423
but he never got it
authenticated.

25:57.489 --> 26:00.693
I wonder if that's because
he knew that it was fake.

26:00.760 --> 26:02.795
It's not a fake.

26:02.862 --> 26:04.196
I'm an artist,
not a forger.

26:04.263 --> 26:05.932
Come on, if you
were a real artist

26:05.998 --> 26:07.266
you would have given
the comic back to Moore.

26:07.333 --> 26:10.870
But you were waiting
for him to die,

26:10.937 --> 26:11.871
ya freakin' vulture.

26:11.938 --> 26:14.273
An artist... like you,

26:14.340 --> 26:15.742
the creator

26:15.808 --> 26:17.043
of that lame NanoPunk?

26:17.109 --> 26:18.945
Oh, yeah, and your
Mr. Bobble Head

26:19.011 --> 26:20.412
is a superhero for the ages.

26:20.479 --> 26:22.348
(laughter)

26:22.414 --> 26:25.451
SKLAR:
Hey, I was robbed.

26:25.517 --> 26:26.886
I was robbed and a man died,

26:26.953 --> 26:28.587
and it's all a big joke to you.

26:28.655 --> 26:30.189
I don't think it's a joke.

26:30.256 --> 26:32.424
In fact,

26:32.491 --> 26:35.194
I have an idea about how
some good can come of this.

26:35.261 --> 26:38.297
The final event of this
convention is the comic auction.

26:38.364 --> 26:40.599
Let's add some items
to that list, shall we?

26:40.667 --> 26:43.235
Everybody who bought
a fake Ultraworld

26:43.302 --> 26:44.570
can put it up for sale.

26:44.637 --> 26:46.205
Yeah, I know,
they're forgeries,

26:46.272 --> 26:48.908
but, hey, come on,
they're famous.

26:48.975 --> 26:51.778
And the money that we raise
can be split between the buyers

26:51.844 --> 26:53.279
that got ripped off,

26:53.345 --> 26:54.847
and Ross Moore.

26:55.848 --> 26:57.316
I'll buy one myself.

26:57.383 --> 26:59.652
(applause)

27:00.720 --> 27:02.354
What do I get out
of something like that?

27:02.421 --> 27:04.323
(crowd grumbling)

27:06.092 --> 27:07.459
Hey, I'm not a bad guy!

27:07.526 --> 27:09.328
I'm a victim!

27:12.131 --> 27:13.565
(chuckles)

27:13.632 --> 27:15.634
Interesting proposal.

27:15.702 --> 27:16.836
An auction.

27:16.903 --> 27:21.407
It wasn't too
"we-are-the-worldish"?

27:21.473 --> 27:23.309
No, not at all. It's great.

27:23.375 --> 27:25.878
So what brings you back to
the land of the Uber Nerds?

27:25.945 --> 27:27.346
I just came down
to let you know

27:27.413 --> 27:29.481
that my analysis is close
to identifying

27:29.548 --> 27:30.549
the forger in this case.

27:30.616 --> 27:33.452
How exactly does
a mathematical analysis

27:33.519 --> 27:35.587
turn into a criminal conviction?

27:35.654 --> 27:36.588
I mean,
you're working

27:36.655 --> 27:38.124
with probabilities, right?

27:38.190 --> 27:40.392
It's not like hard
physical evidence.

27:40.459 --> 27:43.830
Given the right circumstances,
it can lead to that.

27:43.896 --> 27:46.398
Yeah, but, in that case,

27:46.465 --> 27:48.901
even if he math does
implicate someone,

27:48.968 --> 27:51.904
if there's no evidence,
if there's no...

27:51.971 --> 27:53.740
no link to the crime,

27:53.806 --> 27:55.975
you can't prove anything.

27:57.476 --> 28:00.312
Yeah. I guess you're right.

28:00.379 --> 28:01.513
Although,

28:01.580 --> 28:03.916
if you're not privy
to the FBI's case files

28:03.983 --> 28:06.018
and you're not part
of the actual crime,

28:06.085 --> 28:07.820
you can't know
that there's no evidence.

28:10.189 --> 28:13.893
Yeah. I guess
I wouldn't know that.

28:15.928 --> 28:17.830
The ballistics report on the
nine millimeter

28:17.897 --> 28:19.498
used at the robbery.

28:19.565 --> 28:21.600
Stolen from a retired
cop's apartment

28:21.667 --> 28:23.535
in an assisted-living
residence.

28:23.602 --> 28:25.204
How does that help us?

28:25.271 --> 28:27.173
Well, it wouldn't
if it weren't

28:27.239 --> 28:28.440
for this other piece
of information here.

28:28.507 --> 28:31.143
Garrity's mom--
look where she lives.

28:31.210 --> 28:32.845
Rancho Vista Assisted Living.
Same address.

28:32.912 --> 28:35.147
This guy stole a gun
while visiting his mother?

28:35.214 --> 28:37.383
Maybe he was doing more
than just visiting.

28:37.449 --> 28:38.284
Oh, yeah.

28:38.350 --> 28:40.219
Violent ex-con who
wants to get back

28:40.286 --> 28:42.088
into his old ways
of doing business.

28:42.154 --> 28:43.555
Can't hang out with
his former associates.

28:43.622 --> 28:45.892
Doesn't want a residence
with his name on the lease.

28:45.958 --> 28:48.027
He can say he lives
with his mom.

28:50.529 --> 28:52.799
Mrs. Garrity, ma'am, we need you
to come with us, okay?

28:52.865 --> 28:54.867
- What the hell?!
- It's okay, we're FBI.

28:54.934 --> 28:56.368
You can just
come with us over...

28:56.435 --> 28:57.369
Gordy! Gordy!

28:57.436 --> 28:58.771
A little help, please.

28:58.838 --> 29:00.206
- Gordy, it's the damn feds!
- Ma'am, stop with the cane!

29:00.272 --> 29:02.541
Ma'am, ma'am
please, please.

29:03.542 --> 29:05.044
Let's do it.

29:23.462 --> 29:25.197
Guys, go that way.

29:26.532 --> 29:28.968
(indistinct shouting)

29:41.047 --> 29:42.148
Garrity, freeze!

30:08.674 --> 30:10.409
(grunts)

30:12.244 --> 30:13.779
Tell them I'm on the other side
of the building.

30:13.846 --> 30:15.047
That's not going to happen.

30:15.114 --> 30:16.715
- Do it.
- No way.

30:16.782 --> 30:18.517
I said do it!

30:32.698 --> 30:34.366
(gunshot)

30:38.804 --> 30:39.805
He shot himself.

30:39.872 --> 30:40.973
Yeah, he's dead.

30:41.040 --> 30:43.175
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

30:50.482 --> 30:54.220
David, I found this
at the mother's apartment.

30:54.286 --> 30:56.388
Oh, great, let's
get it to Charlie.

30:56.455 --> 30:58.390
Right. Hey,
how you doing?

30:58.457 --> 31:01.160
I'm okay, man.
Thanks for asking.

31:01.227 --> 31:03.062
You know, for
a minute there,

31:03.129 --> 31:05.998
I almost believed
a man could fly.

31:08.134 --> 31:11.037
So, I analyzed the copy that you
guys found with Garrity.

31:11.103 --> 31:12.738
What'd you come up with?

31:12.804 --> 31:14.140
It's not authentic.

31:14.206 --> 31:15.507
It's another forgery.

31:15.574 --> 31:18.710
Okay, was it done by whoever
made the other forgeries?

31:18.777 --> 31:20.079
Yeah, same artist.

31:20.146 --> 31:21.647
Okay, well, assuming
it was a copy

31:21.713 --> 31:23.815
stolen from Sklar, that
means Sklar owned a fake.

31:23.882 --> 31:28.120
No, I just think that's what
Seth wants everyone to believe.

31:31.790 --> 31:33.025
(footsteps approaching)

31:34.260 --> 31:38.197
So, uh, are you doing a slam job
on my son?

31:38.264 --> 31:41.433
No, but I am profiling the
man behind a self-help book

31:41.500 --> 31:43.269
supposedly based
on real science

31:43.335 --> 31:47.839
that offers a simplistic
fix to difficult issues.

31:47.906 --> 31:50.742
Well, let me say this right off,
it's not a supposed science.

31:50.809 --> 31:52.979
Yeah, but we're talking about
people's emotional lives,

31:53.045 --> 31:55.381
talking about making money on
their desire for easy answers.

31:55.447 --> 31:56.715
There's nothing simplistic

31:56.782 --> 31:58.650
about Charlie's thinking,
I can tell you that.

31:58.717 --> 32:01.020
And he didn't write the book
to make money.

32:01.087 --> 32:02.788
Then why did he write it?

32:02.854 --> 32:05.891
You mean now
or when he was nine?

32:05.958 --> 32:08.260
Both.

32:08.961 --> 32:10.262
Okay...

32:10.329 --> 32:12.564
Charlie was an awkward kid.

32:12.631 --> 32:14.033
But he trusted math.

32:14.100 --> 32:16.235
I mean, he felt
safe with math,

32:16.302 --> 32:19.171
so I guess it was natural
to try to use math

32:19.238 --> 32:21.007
to help him get along
with other kids.

32:21.073 --> 32:21.974
Did it work?

32:22.041 --> 32:24.143
Uh, no, not at all.

32:24.210 --> 32:25.677
(chuckles)
Well, then...

32:25.744 --> 32:28.514
Why write the book now?
It's not like it's gonna add

32:28.580 --> 32:31.283
to his professional standing,
and it could even diminish it.

32:31.350 --> 32:33.152
You know, uh, to be honest,

32:33.219 --> 32:35.087
I don't think he really thought
that one through.

32:35.154 --> 32:36.322
- Really?
- He just thought it was

32:36.388 --> 32:38.857
an interesting application of
game theory,

32:38.924 --> 32:40.292
and that everyday people
would read it.

32:40.359 --> 32:44.596
So, he wanted to write it
for a wider audience.

32:44.663 --> 32:46.598
Charlie thinks math
is beautiful.

32:46.665 --> 32:48.234
And he wants everyone

32:48.300 --> 32:50.336
to love it the way he does.

32:50.402 --> 32:53.572
Hmm.

32:53.639 --> 32:55.241
DAVID:
You found something?

32:55.307 --> 32:56.508
CHARLIE:
Yeah.

32:56.575 --> 32:59.411
You know, most forgers
want their forgeries

32:59.478 --> 33:02.414
to fool everybody forever.
Right? Not Seth.

33:02.481 --> 33:04.216
Yeah, 'cause at some point,

33:04.283 --> 33:06.052
he wants the real copy to be
acknowledged.

33:06.118 --> 33:08.854
Right, he has to prove
that the fakes are fake,

33:08.920 --> 33:10.156
so you know what he did?
He marked them.

33:10.222 --> 33:12.324
You found this mark?

33:12.391 --> 33:14.493
Only 'cause I went
looking for it.

33:14.560 --> 33:16.328
See these lines
of varying length?

33:16.395 --> 33:17.663
Yeah.

33:17.729 --> 33:20.966
They are identifiable as a
simple representational code.

33:21.033 --> 33:25.003
Each length represents a
different letter or number.

33:25.071 --> 33:27.106
And look what it spells out.

33:27.173 --> 33:28.340
(chuckles)

33:28.407 --> 33:31.077
"Miles Sklar 2007."

33:31.143 --> 33:32.811
Why would he put
Sklar's name on it?

33:32.878 --> 33:34.946
Ah, 'cause Seth's got
a wicked sense of humor.

33:35.013 --> 33:37.716
Charlie, this is really wild
stuff, but you understand

33:37.783 --> 33:40.186
it really doesn't give us
evidence against Seth Marlowe.

33:40.252 --> 33:41.920
That evidence'll come
at the auction.

33:41.987 --> 33:44.890
Oh, you think that's how he
plans to launder the real copy--

33:44.956 --> 33:46.192
throw it in with the fakes.

33:46.258 --> 33:48.494
A genuine good commingled
with false goods.

33:48.560 --> 33:51.430
In auction theory, we talk about
equilibria or symmetry.

33:51.497 --> 33:53.832
All the bidders have the
exact same information,

33:53.899 --> 33:55.801
except Seth knows something
the other bidders

33:55.867 --> 33:58.537
don't know, which is
that the original copy

33:58.604 --> 34:00.939
of Ultraworld #1 will be
an item up for bid.

34:01.006 --> 34:03.742
So, asymmetrical information
creates asymmetrical bidding.

34:03.809 --> 34:05.077
Charlie, this guy,

34:05.144 --> 34:07.146
he already knows that we suspect
him, right?

34:07.213 --> 34:08.980
So, he's gonna have to use
a straw man

34:09.047 --> 34:10.616
or a proxy
to do the bidding for him.

34:10.682 --> 34:12.784
Right, and that straw man
will be bidding

34:12.851 --> 34:13.785
off of Seth's information.

34:13.852 --> 34:14.620
Now, this asymmetry will

34:14.686 --> 34:15.954
almost certainly create
a situation

34:16.021 --> 34:17.123
called jump bidding,
which is when

34:17.189 --> 34:19.291
a person enters a far larger bid
than necessary

34:19.358 --> 34:21.026
to be the current
winning bidder.

34:21.093 --> 34:24.062
I don't understand.
What's the advantage of that?

34:24.130 --> 34:25.231
It's like a bike race.

34:25.297 --> 34:26.365
Typically, there's no advantage

34:26.432 --> 34:28.267
to jumping ahead of the pack,

34:28.334 --> 34:30.269
so racers tend
to stay clustered together

34:30.336 --> 34:32.037
and switch off the leads.

34:32.104 --> 34:34.240
But there is a strategy
of taking the lead early

34:34.306 --> 34:35.641
to exhaust the competition.

34:35.707 --> 34:38.277
Jump bidding is like quickening
the speed of the race.

34:38.344 --> 34:40.612
It encourages the early exit
of some bidders,

34:40.679 --> 34:42.514
and discourages the
late entry of others.

34:42.581 --> 34:45.117
So, when someone makes
a big bid during the auction...

34:45.184 --> 34:46.552
That Seth's straw man.

34:46.618 --> 34:47.953
And you're going to be able
to tell the real one?

34:48.019 --> 34:50.589
It's the one without
Seth's code drawn into it.

34:50.656 --> 34:51.857
Okay.

34:57.329 --> 34:59.265
(overlapping chatter)

34:59.331 --> 35:00.966
Hiya, Seth.

35:01.032 --> 35:03.669
Professor Eppes.

35:03.735 --> 35:05.437
You come here to catch

35:05.504 --> 35:06.638
the evil mastermind?

35:06.705 --> 35:09.107
I'm here to bid on one
of the famous forgeries.

35:11.177 --> 35:14.846
Who knows?
The real one could be here.

35:16.848 --> 35:19.785
I think they're all fakes,
if you ask me.

35:25.991 --> 35:28.927
What, exactly,
are you looking for, Charlie?

35:28.994 --> 35:31.663
Just looking.

35:31.730 --> 35:33.832
AUCTIONEER: Okay, let's get
started on this special auction

35:33.899 --> 35:37.769
of 14 versions
of the famous Ultraworld #1,

35:37.836 --> 35:41.573
proceeds to benefit the sellers,
and the renowned artist

35:41.640 --> 35:42.774
Ross Moore.

35:47.813 --> 35:49.481
Item one: Ultraworld #1.

35:49.548 --> 35:52.651
Not authenticated.
Believed to be a forgery.

35:52.718 --> 35:55.521
We'll start the bidding at $500.
Do I have $550?

35:55.587 --> 35:57.289
- $550!
- I have $550.

35:57.356 --> 35:59.057
- $600.
- $600. I have $600.

35:59.124 --> 36:00.826
Do I hear $650?

36:00.892 --> 36:02.494
I have $650.

36:02.561 --> 36:04.863
$650 going once, twice and sold.

36:04.930 --> 36:06.632
Moving to Item number two.

36:06.698 --> 36:08.867
$650 going once, twice and...

36:08.934 --> 36:10.168
This is item number five.

36:10.236 --> 36:11.570
Moving to item number five.

36:11.637 --> 36:14.072
Again, we'll start the bidding
at $500. I have $550.

36:14.139 --> 36:17.243
I have $700. Do I have $750?
Sold.

36:17.309 --> 36:19.545
Moving now to item number nine.
Sold.

36:19.611 --> 36:22.248
Going once, twice and sold.

36:22.314 --> 36:25.751
This is item 11,
Ultraworld #1,

36:25.817 --> 36:29.020
again unauthenticated,
possible forgery.

36:29.087 --> 36:30.589
- What do I hear?
- $700!

36:30.656 --> 36:32.524
I have $700. Do I have $750?

36:32.591 --> 36:35.093
$750. Do I have $800?

36:35.160 --> 36:37.729
$2,000.

36:37.796 --> 36:39.231
Here we go.

36:39.298 --> 36:41.767
- $2,050.
- I have $2,050.

36:41.833 --> 36:42.901
$3,000.

36:42.968 --> 36:45.103
I have $3,100 over here.

36:45.170 --> 36:45.971
$4,000.

36:46.037 --> 36:47.906
- I have $4,000.
- $5,000.

36:49.708 --> 36:52.210
$5,500.

36:55.046 --> 36:56.248
$8,000.

36:56.315 --> 36:58.049
- $10,000.
- I have $10,000.

36:58.116 --> 37:00.185
Do I hear $10,500?

37:00.252 --> 37:03.322
- $15,000.
- $20,000.

37:03.389 --> 37:07.158
$20,000. Going once, twice,

37:07.225 --> 37:08.927
three times, and sold!

37:23.208 --> 37:24.776
(alarm chirps)

37:25.877 --> 37:27.779
You figured it out.

37:27.846 --> 37:30.516
Your math stuff worked.

37:32.818 --> 37:34.720
Sklar had the
real one, huh?

37:34.786 --> 37:36.822
The authentic copy
of Ultraworld #1,

37:36.888 --> 37:38.357
and then you stole it.

37:38.424 --> 37:41.126
Ultraworld #1
belongs to Ross Moore.

37:41.192 --> 37:44.996
Not to me, and
certainly not to Miles Sklar.

37:45.063 --> 37:46.298
A man was killed.

37:48.600 --> 37:52.338
Unfortunately,
nothing can change that.

37:52.404 --> 37:54.340
But giving
the comic back

37:54.406 --> 37:55.874
to Ross is going
to change a lot.

37:55.941 --> 37:57.609
Your fan from prison
almost shot my brother.

37:57.676 --> 37:59.445
Charlie, please. Come on.
Please, man.

37:59.511 --> 38:01.012
I know you understand
what this is all about.

38:01.079 --> 38:02.314
Why I did this.
Let me give

38:02.381 --> 38:03.682
the comic back to Ross.

38:03.749 --> 38:06.251
It doesn't work like that, Seth.

38:06.318 --> 38:07.686
Charlie.

38:07.753 --> 38:10.188
Okay, Seth, get your hands
behind your back, please.

38:10.255 --> 38:14.726
We're taking you in
for some questioning.

38:20.666 --> 38:28.774
Vaughn and Garrity, both fans,
read my stuff in prison.

38:28.840 --> 38:31.377
How did you sneak the real copy
into the auction?

38:31.443 --> 38:34.846
I'm the Ross Moore expert,
right?

38:34.913 --> 38:37.649
Everybody

38:37.716 --> 38:40.952
let me examine
their Ultraworld #1.

38:41.019 --> 38:42.721
I swapped the real one
for a fake

38:42.788 --> 38:46.692
owned by a guy who promised
to sell it in the auction.

38:46.758 --> 38:50.862
What were you going
to do with it, genius?

38:50.929 --> 38:53.865
Give it to Ross.

38:53.932 --> 38:54.933
And then,

38:55.000 --> 38:57.736
in six months or so,

38:57.803 --> 38:59.638
I'd pretend to have found
the hidden message

38:59.705 --> 39:02.107
with Sklar's name
in the forgeries.

39:17.723 --> 39:19.224
Well, if it isn't

39:19.290 --> 39:21.560
the crime-fighting professor.

39:21.627 --> 39:25.096
Come to help me
engineer my escape?

39:25.163 --> 39:26.632
No.

39:26.698 --> 39:29.668
Yeah, it was kind
of a long shot.

39:29.735 --> 39:30.769
You heard that Miles Sklar

39:30.836 --> 39:34.105
got the real copy
of Ultraworld #1 back?

39:34.172 --> 39:37.175
Figured that would happen.

39:37.242 --> 39:39.445
He gave it to Ross Moore.

39:39.511 --> 39:41.413
What?

39:41.480 --> 39:43.482
Why?

39:43.549 --> 39:44.950
Partly the intense
public pressure.

39:45.016 --> 39:46.452
I mean,
the guy was being vilified.

39:46.518 --> 39:47.786
That never bothered him before.

39:47.853 --> 39:50.522
And, of course, he made
a big publicity splash

39:50.589 --> 39:51.923
over giving
it to Moore,

39:51.990 --> 39:53.825
just in time
to promote his new comic.

39:55.794 --> 39:58.964
Okay, that's...
that's the Sklar I know.

40:04.035 --> 40:07.405
Still...

40:07.473 --> 40:09.107
he gave it back.

40:24.122 --> 40:25.757
Hey, boys. Good job.

40:25.824 --> 40:26.692
Thanks.

40:26.758 --> 40:27.793
What are you guys
doing this weekend?

40:27.859 --> 40:28.960
Anyone want to grab a bite

40:29.027 --> 40:30.328
or something?

40:30.395 --> 40:31.597
Yeah. Sure.
Sounds good.

40:31.663 --> 40:32.664
We haven't
done anything

40:32.731 --> 40:33.899
outside of work
for a while, right?

40:33.965 --> 40:36.234
There's life outside of work?

40:36.301 --> 40:37.168
News to me.

40:37.235 --> 40:38.837
Colby Granger,

40:38.904 --> 40:40.438
someone at my desk
for you to meet.

40:40.506 --> 40:41.740
Her name's Simone Voray.

40:41.807 --> 40:43.008
She's in my
Krav Maga class.

40:43.074 --> 40:46.011
She's French.
She has a little accent.

40:46.077 --> 40:47.979
And a degree
in literature.

40:48.046 --> 40:50.482
She was a star gymnast
in college.

40:50.549 --> 40:52.818
Now she's an acrobat.

40:52.884 --> 40:54.352
You say she's
a professional acrobat?

40:54.419 --> 40:56.054
Yeah. Cirque du Soleil.

40:56.121 --> 40:57.956
Ready?

41:00.458 --> 41:03.862
Guess it might just be me
and you this weekend, huh?

41:04.663 --> 41:06.197
Yeah. Yeah.

41:09.868 --> 41:11.302
You know, it's funny.

41:11.369 --> 41:13.104
I remember reading all those
comics when I was a kid,

41:13.171 --> 41:14.973
but I never saw
anyone drawing one.

41:15.040 --> 41:16.842
Well, this one should be fun.

41:16.908 --> 41:21.446
Reminds me a little of
the comics I wrote in the '60s.

41:21.513 --> 41:23.248
I wrote under the name

41:23.314 --> 41:24.449
Paisley McNasty.

41:24.516 --> 41:26.451
Really?

41:26.518 --> 41:28.920
I have a little trouble
picturing you as a hippie.

41:28.987 --> 41:29.921
What?

41:31.256 --> 41:32.490
Right.

41:32.558 --> 41:33.692
You know, Charles,

41:33.759 --> 41:36.528
you have a rather
distinguished chin there.

41:36.595 --> 41:37.696
He's going

41:37.763 --> 41:39.430
to be a superhero,

41:39.497 --> 41:40.799
along with
his brother.

41:40.866 --> 41:42.133
Hold on.
Wait a minute.

41:42.200 --> 41:44.703
You think someone actually
might publish this?

41:44.770 --> 41:46.838
An FBI agent who solves crimes

41:46.905 --> 41:48.974
with the help
of his mathematician brother?

41:49.040 --> 41:50.876
(laughing):
It's great!

41:50.942 --> 41:52.544
Aw, nobody would believe it.

41:52.611 --> 41:54.345
Oh, that reminds me.
Charlie, look

41:54.412 --> 41:56.815
what came in the mail
from that magazine.

41:56.882 --> 41:58.917
That's the proof
of the article?

41:58.984 --> 42:00.085
I don't even know
why I'm looking at this.

42:00.151 --> 42:01.252
This guy was totally
out to get me.

42:01.319 --> 42:03.622
No, no, no, no.
It's not a hit piece.

42:03.689 --> 42:05.190
Sure, he makes some jokes
at your expense,

42:05.256 --> 42:07.425
but, actually,
they're quite funny.

42:07.492 --> 42:09.294
"His brother Don,
a special agent

42:09.360 --> 42:11.797
"in the Los Angeles office
of the FBI,

42:11.863 --> 42:13.865
"believes Charles Eppes
has recently conquered

42:13.932 --> 42:15.400
"the greatest challenge
of friendship.

42:15.466 --> 42:17.502
'Charlie and I had
our issues growing up.'"

42:17.569 --> 42:19.237
Yeah, to say the least.

42:19.304 --> 42:20.806
"But if there's
anything stronger

42:20.872 --> 42:22.173
"than the bond between brothers,

42:22.240 --> 42:25.376
"it's the bond between brothers
who have become friends.

42:25.443 --> 42:26.878
'Charlie's my friend.'"

42:26.945 --> 42:29.648
ALAN: Donnie.
CHARLIE: Aw...

42:29.715 --> 42:32.050
I didn't even know the writer
wanted to talk with you.

42:32.117 --> 42:33.885
I had to get my name
in the magazine somehow, right?

42:33.952 --> 42:35.754
ALAN:
Yeah, yeah. Right.

42:35.821 --> 42:37.388
You can keep your
disposable media.

42:37.455 --> 42:38.624
A magazine is
old in a week.

42:38.690 --> 42:41.559
A comic book...
well, that's forever.

42:41.627 --> 42:42.661
DON:
That's right.

42:42.728 --> 42:44.996
Well, let's get back in
our Charlie's Angels pose.

42:45.063 --> 42:47.966
This is more
like Tango & Cash.
