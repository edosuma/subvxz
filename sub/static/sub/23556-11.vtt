<font color="#fff00">Corrected & Synced by Bakugan</font>

00:05.339 --> 00:07.639
So, we know there's a
traitor in the relatives.

00:07.708 --> 00:09.742
I've narrowed it down to four suspects.

00:09.810 --> 00:12.144
All right, so there's Bernard, Rinus,

00:12.213 --> 00:13.645
Martin and Diane.

00:13.714 --> 00:15.614
One of them is the mole.

00:15.683 --> 00:17.282
There's a mole?

00:17.351 --> 00:18.384
That's right, Evie.

00:18.452 --> 00:19.985
Don't moles live underground?

00:20.054 --> 00:21.653
Not an actual mole.

00:21.722 --> 00:24.390
A mole is like a... a rat.

00:24.458 --> 00:25.391
A rat?!

00:25.459 --> 00:26.425
Yuck!

00:26.494 --> 00:27.726
I thought we were looking for people.

00:27.795 --> 00:28.761
You know what?

00:28.829 --> 00:29.862
I'll just explain it later.

00:29.930 --> 00:31.363
Come on, come on.

00:31.432 --> 00:33.532
A rat, like, figures...

00:33.601 --> 00:35.501
I don't know...

00:36.837 --> 00:39.538
Now to enhance the audio levels.

00:41.275 --> 00:42.341
I think Bernard.

00:42.410 --> 00:43.575
Why?

00:43.644 --> 00:45.277
Because "ard" rhymes with "card,"

00:45.346 --> 00:46.845
so he's a wildcard.

00:46.914 --> 00:48.280
- Yes, it's working!
- That makes zero sense.

00:48.349 --> 00:49.348
My money's on Diane.

00:49.417 --> 00:50.816
Diane?! Why?

00:50.885 --> 00:51.817
She's great.

00:51.886 --> 00:52.951
I'd love to be like her.

00:53.020 --> 00:55.054
She's like the warmest, nicest lady.

00:55.122 --> 00:56.455
That's why I think it's her.

00:56.524 --> 00:58.057
Too warm, too nice.

00:58.125 --> 00:59.091
What do you think, Sal?

00:59.160 --> 01:00.092
I don't know.

01:00.161 --> 01:01.693
I can't tell just by looking at photos.

01:01.762 --> 01:02.694
I need more to go on.

01:02.763 --> 01:03.695
Evidence.

01:03.764 --> 01:05.197
True.

01:05.266 --> 01:07.466
But maybe there's another way
of getting them to tell us.

01:07.535 --> 01:08.734
Here's what we're gonna do.

01:08.803 --> 01:10.369
We'll tell all four relatives separately

01:10.438 --> 01:11.670
that Erik is gonna flee the country

01:11.739 --> 01:13.272
to make a run for it.

01:13.340 --> 01:14.306
The first one to leave
to warn the cops...

01:14.375 --> 01:15.307
Is our mole.

01:15.376 --> 01:16.308
Exactly.

01:16.377 --> 01:17.309
Huh?

01:17.378 --> 01:18.477
How do you figure?

01:18.546 --> 01:19.912
The mole doesn't want Erik getting away.

01:19.980 --> 01:21.447
He wants him in jail.

01:21.515 --> 01:23.482
That's why he framed him
in the first place.

01:23.551 --> 01:26.318
He or she will try to
stop Erik from getting away.

01:26.387 --> 01:27.920
This could actually work.

01:27.988 --> 01:29.354
Good plan, Jake.

01:29.423 --> 01:31.757
So, uh, the question is...

01:31.826 --> 01:32.825
how are we gonna get them here?

01:35.563 --> 01:36.662
I will stop them

01:36.730 --> 01:38.263
and I know just what to do.

01:45.005 --> 01:45.938
Warning.

01:46.006 --> 01:47.306
Temperature rising.

01:49.643 --> 01:51.610
Can't we just call them up
and invite them over?

01:52.880 --> 01:56.081
Anika, that's... actually a good idea.

01:56.150 --> 01:57.382
No, it's not.

01:57.451 --> 01:59.284
Don't you think they'd be
a little suspicious,

01:59.353 --> 02:01.620
especially after they
told us to stay out of it?

02:01.689 --> 02:03.856
But what if the invitation
didn't come from us?

02:03.924 --> 02:05.824
What if it came from Erik?

02:05.893 --> 02:06.825
How are we gonna pull that off?

02:09.830 --> 02:12.164
Sal, can't you make it
look like there's an email

02:12.233 --> 02:13.665
coming from Erik's computer?

02:13.734 --> 02:15.267
It's tricky.

02:15.336 --> 02:17.269
I'll have to go through
the house network...

02:17.338 --> 02:18.904
You'll make it work, right?

02:18.973 --> 02:19.905
Easy peasy.

02:19.974 --> 02:21.440
Yeah, yeah.

02:21.509 --> 02:23.842
And... sent.

02:23.911 --> 02:24.843
Awesome.

02:24.912 --> 02:26.044
All we need to do now is wait.

02:26.113 --> 02:27.079
That was peasy easy.

02:28.482 --> 02:29.414
Whoa.

02:29.483 --> 02:30.449
Wait.

02:32.119 --> 02:33.152
It's not responding anymore.

02:33.220 --> 02:34.987
What do you mean?

02:35.055 --> 02:36.455
"System overheated.

02:36.524 --> 02:38.724
"Shut down in four, three

02:38.792 --> 02:40.626
two, one."

02:45.099 --> 02:46.398
Did someone turn up the heat?

02:49.770 --> 02:51.703
It's like something's
wrong with the whole system.

02:51.772 --> 02:52.871
Well, can't you turn it off?

02:52.940 --> 02:54.373
The climate control for the paintings

02:54.441 --> 02:56.308
is on the same system.

02:56.377 --> 02:57.743
Can't risk it.

02:57.811 --> 02:59.378
They're too valuable.

02:59.446 --> 03:01.980
Ugh... I hope it doesn't get any hotter.

03:02.049 --> 03:04.283
What time did you tell
the relatives to get here?

03:04.351 --> 03:06.185
I can't wait any longer in this heat.

03:06.253 --> 03:07.653
Here, try my laptop.

03:07.721 --> 03:09.555
Can't we just go outside for awhile?

03:09.623 --> 03:11.156
We can't leave.

03:11.225 --> 03:12.658
We have to be here when they show up.

03:12.726 --> 03:13.859
Hey, guys.

03:13.928 --> 03:15.894
Looks like the thermostat
has gone haywire.

03:15.963 --> 03:17.062
Don't worry.

03:17.131 --> 03:18.630
If we can't figure it out soon,

03:18.699 --> 03:20.766
we'll all go stay in a hotel.

03:20.834 --> 03:22.501
We don't have to do that.

03:22.570 --> 03:23.535
It's not that hot.

03:23.604 --> 03:24.736
Yeah.

03:24.805 --> 03:27.339
As a matter of fact,
I could use a jacket.

03:27.408 --> 03:29.341
Perfect temperature
if you ask me.

03:29.410 --> 03:30.542
Besides, we have to wait here

03:30.611 --> 03:31.843
because we're waiting for the rela...

03:31.912 --> 03:33.979
Waiting for Sal to play relaxing music.

03:34.048 --> 03:35.314
Yeah.

03:37.985 --> 03:40.619
Soothing sounds of a humpback whale.

03:40.688 --> 03:42.020
My all-time favorite.

03:42.089 --> 03:43.021
Okay.

03:46.994 --> 03:48.026
Oh!

03:48.095 --> 03:49.928
I can't take another minute in here.

03:49.997 --> 03:51.396
You know what will make
everything better?

03:54.134 --> 03:55.467
- Ice cream.
- Yay!

04:00.741 --> 04:01.673
How'd you get back the video

04:01.742 --> 04:03.575
of the museum robbery?

04:03.644 --> 04:05.177
I recovered the file
when Janine was here.

04:06.714 --> 04:09.615
If only we could see
who's behind the mask.

04:09.683 --> 04:10.749
Maybe we could use

04:10.818 --> 04:12.484
the face-recognition software I created.

04:12.553 --> 04:13.485
Right.

04:13.554 --> 04:15.053
Recofize 2.1.

04:15.122 --> 04:16.755
Recofize 2.1 won't.

04:18.892 --> 04:21.892
But the new-and-improved
Recofize 2.2 just might!

04:23.063 --> 04:24.062
Warning.

04:24.131 --> 04:26.198
Face recognition in progression.

04:28.335 --> 04:29.368
Warning.

04:29.436 --> 04:31.169
Face recognition in progression.

04:31.238 --> 04:33.071
I don't know how they
still have the video.

04:33.140 --> 04:36.008
I deleted all the files of the system.

04:36.076 --> 04:37.376
But don't worry, boss.

04:37.444 --> 04:39.344
They won't be able to recognize my face.

04:39.413 --> 04:40.779
I mean, those Hunters are smart

04:40.848 --> 04:42.648
but we're way smarter.

04:42.716 --> 04:44.950
- I'll stop them...
- whatever it takes.

04:49.056 --> 04:50.656
Guys, I have something
important to tell you.

04:53.694 --> 04:55.694
Is it me, or is it really hot in here?

04:55.763 --> 04:57.229
We hadn't noticed.

04:57.298 --> 04:58.730
What's on your mind, Daniel?

05:01.268 --> 05:03.402
The judge decided that
there's enough evidence

05:03.470 --> 05:05.203
to put Erik on trial.

05:05.272 --> 05:06.438
But what about all the evidence

05:06.507 --> 05:08.140
that he's being framed?

05:08.208 --> 05:09.875
Can't you just give him that?

05:09.943 --> 05:11.543
We're... we're this close
to a breakthrough.

05:11.612 --> 05:13.779
Tell... tell them
you almost solved the case.

05:13.847 --> 05:15.080
That's another thing.

05:15.149 --> 05:16.915
I can't have anything to do
with the case anymore.

05:18.986 --> 05:19.918
Erik...

05:19.987 --> 05:21.887
I heard.

05:21.955 --> 05:23.255
I really wanna help.

05:23.324 --> 05:24.656
I know.

05:24.725 --> 05:25.657
You tried.

05:25.726 --> 05:26.892
That's what matters.

05:26.960 --> 05:28.026
Thanks for everything.

05:28.095 --> 05:30.062
Isn't there, like,
something you can do or...

05:30.130 --> 05:33.498
We are not gonna let Daniel
lose his job over this.

05:33.567 --> 05:36.301
Erik and I will fix this.

05:36.370 --> 05:38.637
The relatives sent me a message.

05:38.706 --> 05:40.305
They're coming over.

05:40.374 --> 05:42.674
I don't know why but...

05:42.743 --> 05:44.076
I hope it's good news.

05:48.315 --> 05:49.781
Can you fix it?

05:49.850 --> 05:51.016
I think so.

05:51.085 --> 05:53.352
It's basically a small computer.

05:53.420 --> 05:54.720
Hey, do you guys think that

05:54.788 --> 05:56.688
Daniel was acting kind of weird?

05:56.757 --> 05:58.290
Yeah.

05:58.359 --> 06:00.125
He only drank two glasses of lemonade.

06:00.194 --> 06:01.993
Normally he guzzles a whole pitcher.

06:02.062 --> 06:04.429
No, I mean like he was hiding something.

06:07.234 --> 06:09.267
System overload,
system error.

06:09.336 --> 06:11.803
- System overload, system error.
- I'm gonna guess
you didn't fix that.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.238
System overload, system error.

06:13.307 --> 06:14.439
I think I made it worse.

06:14.508 --> 06:15.440
System error.

06:17.000 --> 06:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:25.619 --> 06:26.651
What?

06:26.720 --> 06:27.986
Nobody hungry?

06:28.055 --> 06:29.654
It's too hot to eat boiled peas.

06:29.723 --> 06:32.491
Frozen peas... that's another story.

06:34.762 --> 06:35.694
What time are the relatives coming?

06:37.197 --> 06:39.331
They didn't give me an exact time.

06:39.400 --> 06:41.032
But it should be soon.

06:41.101 --> 06:42.834
I'm just curious to why?

06:45.038 --> 06:46.705
This is taking forever.

06:51.211 --> 06:52.911
Look, I have fans following me.

06:53.981 --> 06:55.614
Funny, Anika.

06:55.682 --> 06:57.382
Is all that really necessary?

06:57.451 --> 06:59.484
Well, it's getting
even hotter now, so...

07:12.099 --> 07:13.031
You're gonna overload

07:13.100 --> 07:14.266
the electrical system with all those.

07:14.334 --> 07:15.500
Nah, don't worry.

07:15.569 --> 07:17.636
This old house has
good old-fashioned wiring.

07:17.704 --> 07:19.938
I... I don't think that's right.

07:20.007 --> 07:21.540
I thought Daniel would do a little more

07:21.608 --> 07:22.774
to help out Erik.

07:22.843 --> 07:24.109
He's our brother, Tess.

07:24.178 --> 07:26.044
I'm sure he's doing everything he can.

07:29.249 --> 07:31.149
Where did you get all these fans?

07:31.218 --> 07:32.184
All over.

07:32.252 --> 07:33.552
I get new fans where ever I go.

07:36.623 --> 07:37.556
And this...

07:39.993 --> 07:41.927
...is my biggest fan.

07:44.331 --> 07:45.263
Guys, check this out.

07:47.801 --> 07:48.733
We're over 50%.

07:48.802 --> 07:49.734
It's speeding up.

07:49.803 --> 07:51.136
Oh, no.

07:51.205 --> 07:53.572
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

07:58.145 --> 07:59.077
I'm sorry.

07:59.146 --> 08:00.178
I've got one last trick.

08:08.355 --> 08:09.688
What happened?

08:09.756 --> 08:11.756
I think... we blew a fuse.

08:12.893 --> 08:13.825
Sorry.

08:14.895 --> 08:15.827
Kids!

08:18.832 --> 08:20.265
Where are you?

08:20.334 --> 08:21.666
Kids.

08:21.735 --> 08:22.667
Everybody okay?

08:22.736 --> 08:23.668
Yeah, sort of.

08:23.737 --> 08:25.003
What happened?

08:25.072 --> 08:28.340
Oh, Anika just used up
all the power in the world.

08:28.408 --> 08:29.541
It wasn't me.

08:29.610 --> 08:31.476
It was my fan base.

08:31.545 --> 08:33.078
Yeah.

08:39.953 --> 08:40.885
Let's do this.

08:48.061 --> 08:49.261
Connection established.

08:49.329 --> 08:50.529
Yes!

08:50.597 --> 08:52.430
"And then they kissed

08:52.499 --> 08:55.333
and lived happily ever after."

08:55.402 --> 08:56.468
Another story!

08:56.537 --> 08:58.670
No, honey, you have to go to sleep.

08:58.739 --> 09:00.672
I'm pretty tired myself.

09:00.741 --> 09:01.773
Everything okay?

09:01.842 --> 09:03.074
Yeah, we're fine, Jake.

09:03.143 --> 09:04.843
Great, great.

09:04.912 --> 09:06.745
Just, uh, just checking.

09:06.813 --> 09:08.413
Look, the dark is fun.

09:08.482 --> 09:10.415
You can read scary stories.

09:10.484 --> 09:12.083
There's nothing to be afraid of.

09:12.152 --> 09:13.618
Oh, wow.

09:13.687 --> 09:14.619
You're very brave, Evie.

09:16.356 --> 09:17.656
Okay.

09:23.597 --> 09:24.729
Has anyone got a spare flashlight?

09:34.441 --> 09:36.341
Oh, I think this is python.

09:36.410 --> 09:38.276
There are snakes in here?!

09:38.345 --> 09:40.512
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

09:40.581 --> 09:42.881
Python is a programming language.

09:42.950 --> 09:45.083
Oh... yeah, right.

09:45.152 --> 09:46.751
I knew that, I was...
I was just playing around.

09:51.124 --> 09:52.057
Who's there?

09:58.799 --> 09:59.731
Who's there?

10:09.242 --> 10:10.175
Oh!

10:10.243 --> 10:11.209
Right...

10:12.879 --> 10:13.979
Do you mind?!

10:14.047 --> 10:15.046
Right, sorry, um...

10:16.717 --> 10:17.649
It's Bernard.

10:17.718 --> 10:18.817
Well, let him in.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.720
Yeah, come on in.

10:21.788 --> 10:23.021
Do you want a drink or anything?

10:23.090 --> 10:24.022
Yeah, that'd be nice.

10:25.459 --> 10:27.592
You know, why is it so dark in here?

10:27.661 --> 10:28.660
And the doorbell didn't work.

10:30.497 --> 10:31.429
Whoof.

10:31.498 --> 10:32.430
It's hot in here.

10:32.499 --> 10:34.265
Yeah, it's a long story.

10:34.334 --> 10:35.300
Erik will be down in a minute,

10:35.369 --> 10:38.370
so, uh, you can just
wait in the kitchen.

10:38.438 --> 10:39.504
- Okay.
- Yeah.

10:39.573 --> 10:40.505
Follow me.

10:53.687 --> 10:54.886
Anika.

10:54.955 --> 10:56.855
Hmm...

10:56.923 --> 10:59.491
It's time, the relatives are showing up.

10:59.559 --> 11:01.493
Of course the bears are made of carrots.

11:04.665 --> 11:06.197
Anika, wake up!

11:06.266 --> 11:07.632
It's time for the plan.

11:07.701 --> 11:10.001
Oh, right, the plan.

11:10.070 --> 11:11.436
Uh, what plan?

11:11.505 --> 11:12.604
We're gonna tell the relatives

11:12.673 --> 11:13.838
that Erik's flying the coop.

11:13.907 --> 11:14.973
Right.

11:15.042 --> 11:17.008
Tell Erik that
the relatives are in the coop.

11:18.712 --> 11:19.644
Anika!

11:21.048 --> 11:22.280
Are you sure you can handle this?

11:22.349 --> 11:24.182
Yeah, I can handle this.

11:24.251 --> 11:25.283
I got it.

11:26.720 --> 11:28.253
Hey, Rinus.

11:28.321 --> 11:29.721
Welcome.

11:29.790 --> 11:31.623
Let's go to the museum.

11:31.692 --> 11:33.558
You can wait for Erik in there.

11:33.627 --> 11:35.794
I don't mind waiting in here.

11:35.862 --> 11:38.897
Is it just me, or is it
incredibly hot in here?

11:38.965 --> 11:41.966
Uh, it's cooler in the museum.

11:42.035 --> 11:43.768
You'll be much more comfortable.

11:43.837 --> 11:45.003
Come on.

11:46.606 --> 11:47.539
Okay.

11:49.943 --> 11:51.376
I don't think we're
supposed to tell you this.

11:51.445 --> 11:52.811
Okay, listen.

11:52.879 --> 11:54.212
Erik got a fake passport,

11:54.281 --> 11:56.014
signed on as a crewman on a freighter

11:56.083 --> 11:57.148
bound for Brazil.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.884
He's flying out tonight to Indonesia.

11:59.953 --> 12:02.287
Erik's got a car
waiting to take him to France.

12:02.355 --> 12:04.222
Hi, Diane.

12:04.291 --> 12:06.291
Can I, uh, take your tag?

12:07.861 --> 12:09.494
I beg your pardon.

12:09.563 --> 12:11.129
He's making a run for it?

12:11.198 --> 12:12.997
Uh... I just

12:13.066 --> 12:14.799
don't understand why he would do that.

12:14.868 --> 12:16.801
That wouldn't be wise.

12:16.870 --> 12:18.036
I know.

12:18.105 --> 12:19.370
That doesn't sound like Erik.

12:26.780 --> 12:28.179
Uh...

12:28.248 --> 12:30.048
Erik... yeah.

12:30.117 --> 12:31.549
Erik's gonna ride his bicycle

12:31.618 --> 12:32.550
all around the world.

12:32.619 --> 12:33.618
Yeah.

12:33.687 --> 12:34.819
I don't know how you can
ride your bicycle

12:34.888 --> 12:35.987
across the ocean,

12:36.056 --> 12:37.222
but if anybody can do it, it's Erik.

12:37.290 --> 12:38.289
You know why?

12:38.358 --> 12:40.125
Because he's determined and fast.

12:40.193 --> 12:41.559
Erik is leaving?

12:41.628 --> 12:43.795
Well, it's what he wants.

12:43.864 --> 12:46.131
I'm afraid he's
gonna do something stupid.

12:46.199 --> 12:47.532
He doesn't wanna go to jail.

12:47.601 --> 12:50.235
And he's pretty sure
he can disappear over there.

12:50.303 --> 12:51.603
Before his trial?

12:53.140 --> 12:55.373
It's scorching in here, isn't it?

12:55.442 --> 12:57.475
Please don't say I told you.

12:57.544 --> 12:58.810
Oh, of course.

13:02.883 --> 13:04.415
Diane.

13:04.484 --> 13:05.884
So nice to see you again.

13:05.952 --> 13:07.218
Likewise, Erik.

13:07.287 --> 13:08.586
I suggest we start the meeting.

13:10.457 --> 13:11.656
In private.

13:16.797 --> 13:17.796
Come this way, everyone.

13:37.284 --> 13:38.216
What's going on?

13:41.521 --> 13:42.453
Shh...

13:49.629 --> 13:50.662
What can you hear?

13:52.098 --> 13:53.031
Anika!

13:54.167 --> 13:55.099
Cakes are flying.

13:55.168 --> 13:56.401
- Shh!
- Shh!

13:59.439 --> 14:00.371
I can't hear anything.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.273
The door's too thick.

14:02.342 --> 14:03.875
- The vent.
- The vent.

14:07.113 --> 14:08.446
So, what's the plan?

14:13.253 --> 14:14.185
From inside this vent

14:14.254 --> 14:16.521
I'll be able to hear everything.

14:16.590 --> 14:19.224
Are you sure you wanna do this?

14:19.292 --> 14:21.759
It's even hotter in there.

14:21.828 --> 14:22.994
You're not scared?

14:23.063 --> 14:23.995
You know me.

14:29.135 --> 14:31.336
I have a feeling we'll
find out who the mole is.

14:31.404 --> 14:32.337
Or... or the rat.

14:51.057 --> 14:52.257
Did we miss it?

14:52.325 --> 14:53.258
Are they still talking?

14:55.362 --> 14:57.996
The conversation isn't over... over.

14:58.064 --> 14:59.464
Can you hear what they're saying?

14:59.532 --> 15:00.465
Don't get me wrong.

15:00.533 --> 15:02.133
I'm glad you came, but...

15:02.202 --> 15:03.301
I don't know why you're here.

15:03.370 --> 15:04.802
Because of the message.

15:04.871 --> 15:06.671
The message?

15:06.740 --> 15:08.172
What message? From who?

15:09.943 --> 15:11.976
You asked us to meet and we're here.

15:12.045 --> 15:13.378
I didn't ask to meet.

15:13.446 --> 15:14.913
You asked me.

15:18.051 --> 15:20.585
Well, this seems like a waste of time.

15:20.654 --> 15:23.187
I need to go and attend
to more important matters.

15:23.256 --> 15:24.222
Good evening.

15:25.825 --> 15:27.025
Diane is leaving.

15:27.093 --> 15:28.793
I'm coming over... over.

15:28.862 --> 15:31.529
No, we may be able to
learn something else.

15:31.598 --> 15:33.498
Stay there 'til it's over... over.

15:44.644 --> 15:46.744
If there's no reason for us to meet,

15:46.813 --> 15:49.047
I suggest we adjourn.

15:49.115 --> 15:50.381
What... what's going on?

15:50.450 --> 15:53.584
I think this conversation
is just about over... over.

15:53.653 --> 15:55.053
But since we're all together anyway,

15:55.121 --> 15:56.988
there is something that
I'd at least like to say.

15:58.191 --> 15:59.924
Erik, we need to talk about
the turnover.

16:02.362 --> 16:03.795
Yes.

16:03.863 --> 16:04.829
The turnover.

16:06.099 --> 16:08.733
They're talking about
a turnover... over.

16:08.802 --> 16:09.734
What do they mean by "turnover"?

16:09.803 --> 16:11.169
Over!

16:11.237 --> 16:13.004
How am I supposed to know
what they mean by "turnover"?

16:13.073 --> 16:14.005
Over!

16:27.087 --> 16:28.453
Diane's the rat.

16:28.521 --> 16:29.454
You mean the mole.

16:29.522 --> 16:30.455
The whatever.

16:30.523 --> 16:31.689
She just left.

16:31.758 --> 16:33.358
So let's follow her
and catch her in the act.

16:33.426 --> 16:34.592
Sal, you stay here, yeah?

16:34.661 --> 16:36.094
Why do I have to stay?

16:36.162 --> 16:37.662
Because you need to get
the lights back on.

16:37.731 --> 16:40.031
And turn the heat off.

16:40.100 --> 16:41.466
And maybe put this one back to bed.

16:41.534 --> 16:42.467
No.

16:42.535 --> 16:44.235
We can't eat those waffles.

16:44.304 --> 16:45.603
They're my guests.

16:46.906 --> 16:48.439
- Right, will do.
- Cool.

16:49.976 --> 16:50.942
Anika?

16:51.011 --> 16:52.010
No...

17:00.620 --> 17:03.421
You really need to get that
heating system fixed, Erik.

17:03.490 --> 17:04.622
I know.

17:04.691 --> 17:07.492
Well, thanks for coming by.

17:07.560 --> 17:09.493
And sorry about the confusion.

17:09.561 --> 17:12.463
I can't just fathom
what's going on here.

17:12.531 --> 17:14.632
And you're sure there's nothing else

17:14.701 --> 17:16.099
you'd like to tell us?

17:16.169 --> 17:17.801
Well, no.

17:17.871 --> 17:19.037
Nothing that I can think of.

17:20.173 --> 17:21.105
Well, good night.

17:25.744 --> 17:26.911
Good night.

17:26.980 --> 17:28.012
Good night.

17:40.160 --> 17:41.359
Diane's going into
the restaurant.

17:46.633 --> 17:47.598
Let's follow her inside.

17:59.279 --> 18:00.812
You think she's meeting someone?

18:00.880 --> 18:01.879
Could be.

18:01.948 --> 18:02.980
Come on, let's get a little bit closer.

18:06.920 --> 18:08.386
Excuse me.

18:08.455 --> 18:09.487
Do you have a reservation?

18:10.890 --> 18:11.923
Do you have a reservation?

18:11.991 --> 18:13.191
Uh, uh...

18:13.259 --> 18:14.826
Of course we have a reservation.

18:14.894 --> 18:16.127
Do we look like the kind of people

18:16.196 --> 18:18.663
to just wander into
a fine-dining establishment?

18:18.731 --> 18:20.731
It's under...

18:20.800 --> 18:22.266
Johnson, it's under Johnson.

18:22.335 --> 18:24.235
Yeah, table for two, yes.

18:24.304 --> 18:26.104
I have a Johnson table for four.

18:26.172 --> 18:27.438
That's us.

18:27.507 --> 18:28.639
The other two got the flu.

18:28.708 --> 18:30.041
Tragic, I know.

18:30.110 --> 18:31.576
Right.

18:31.644 --> 18:32.710
One moment please.

18:35.448 --> 18:36.514
I can't believe there was actually

18:36.583 --> 18:38.716
a reservation under Johnson.

18:38.785 --> 18:41.219
There's always a Johnson reservation.

18:41.287 --> 18:42.753
Hmm...

18:42.822 --> 18:43.988
What's Diane doing now?

18:44.057 --> 18:45.456
She's still just sitting there.

18:45.525 --> 18:46.724
We have to go closer.

18:48.862 --> 18:51.662
May I delight you with
a complimentary amuse-bouche,

18:51.731 --> 18:53.097
crispy chicken katsu

18:53.166 --> 18:55.099
topped with a horseradish aioli?

18:55.168 --> 18:56.367
Uh, no thank you.

18:56.436 --> 18:57.368
Just water for me.

18:57.437 --> 18:58.536
Cold water, please.

18:58.605 --> 19:00.071
Certainly, ma'am.

19:00.140 --> 19:01.172
What was that?

19:01.241 --> 19:03.941
About a compliment mousse bouche?

19:04.010 --> 19:05.409
Amuse-bouche, sir.

19:05.478 --> 19:08.279
A little taste to awaken the appetite.

19:08.348 --> 19:09.914
Complimentary means free.

19:09.983 --> 19:10.915
Free?

19:10.984 --> 19:11.916
Oh yeah!

19:11.985 --> 19:12.917
Bring 'em on.

19:12.986 --> 19:14.185
I'll take four, please.

19:14.254 --> 19:15.319
No, better make that six.

19:15.388 --> 19:16.420
You know, eight.

19:16.489 --> 19:19.157
Keep those bad boy
mousse-bouches coming, yeah?

19:19.225 --> 19:20.224
Thank you.

19:30.103 --> 19:31.702
Hello.

19:31.771 --> 19:33.671
Uh, who's this?

19:33.740 --> 19:34.672
A friend.

19:34.741 --> 19:35.673
Friend?

19:35.742 --> 19:37.208
Jake, Tess?

19:37.277 --> 19:38.609
Is this some kind of joke?

19:38.678 --> 19:39.977
No, I can help you.

19:40.046 --> 19:41.312
I fixed your heating system.

19:48.888 --> 19:50.021
Who are you?

19:50.089 --> 19:51.322
Call me Apollo.

19:53.493 --> 19:55.493
Okay.

19:55.562 --> 19:56.794
Apollo what?

19:56.863 --> 20:00.431
Just Apollo, with a zero at the end.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.833
Okay, Apollo Zero.

20:02.902 --> 20:05.203
No, the zero replaces
the "O" at the end.

20:05.271 --> 20:07.004
Just say Apoll0.

20:07.073 --> 20:08.773
Okay, well, if you just
pronounce it Apollo,

20:08.841 --> 20:10.975
then why bother
replacing the zero with...

20:11.044 --> 20:13.444
Get your computer back online.

20:13.513 --> 20:15.813
By the way, I fixed the power.

20:15.882 --> 20:16.914
Uh, no.

20:16.983 --> 20:19.116
The power still isn't working.

20:20.853 --> 20:22.320
You're welcome.

20:22.388 --> 20:23.387
Wha...

20:40.907 --> 20:42.006
Mmm.

20:42.075 --> 20:43.441
These are actually pretty good.

20:43.509 --> 20:44.442
Stay here.

20:44.510 --> 20:45.476
I'm gonna get closer to Diane.

21:01.628 --> 21:03.227
Excuse me.

21:03.296 --> 21:04.729
I have a party of four waiting.

21:06.866 --> 21:08.032
The Johnsons.

21:09.969 --> 21:11.202
Um, well...

21:14.641 --> 21:15.673
Ha...

21:21.414 --> 21:22.813
- So good of you to come.
- Hi.

21:24.417 --> 21:28.319
Daniel, I trust you kept
our little meeting secret.
