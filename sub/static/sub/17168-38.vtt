00:51.017 --> 00:52.584
ALL: Ninja!

00:54.854 --> 00:57.556
-BEAST BOY: Hey, guys!
-Why are you dressed
like that?

00:57.558 --> 00:59.224
I thought this was
a slumber party.

00:59.226 --> 01:01.993
This is not a slumber
party, dude.
This is a mission.

01:01.995 --> 01:04.896
So, how come you're
all wearing those
footie pajamas?

01:04.898 --> 01:07.366
We are not wearing
the footy pajamas.

01:07.368 --> 01:09.434
These are Shinobi Shozoku,

01:09.436 --> 01:11.470
the traditional garb
of the ninja.

01:11.472 --> 01:13.205
They are designed
for stealth operations.

01:13.207 --> 01:15.640
And without them, we'll never
complete our mission.

01:15.642 --> 01:18.777
Capture the McGuffin
hidden inside this fortress.

01:19.545 --> 01:20.746
What's a McGuffin?

01:20.748 --> 01:23.048
-It's what we're after.
-But what is it?

01:23.050 --> 01:25.517
That's not important.
What's important is we move...

01:26.586 --> 01:29.020
(WHISPERING) Quietly.

01:29.022 --> 01:30.856
(MUSIC PLAYING)

01:42.435 --> 01:44.136
Oh, snap! A penny!

01:44.138 --> 01:46.405
Ha-ha! Guys, look! A penny!

01:47.473 --> 01:49.040
(ALARM BLARING)

01:50.410 --> 01:51.743
My bad.

01:55.281 --> 01:57.883
Behold! Inside that box is

01:57.885 --> 01:59.251
the McGuffin.

01:59.253 --> 02:01.253
You still have
not told us what it is.

02:01.255 --> 02:02.821
It is what we've
come here for.

02:02.823 --> 02:05.457
-But why?
-When you see it,
you'll understand.

02:05.459 --> 02:07.859
The McGuffin needs
no explanation.

02:07.861 --> 02:10.028
BEAST BOY: Well,
let's open it up, yo.
CYBORG: Stop!

02:10.030 --> 02:11.096
(BLOWS)

02:12.965 --> 02:14.766
-Whoa... Cool.
-(EXCLAIMS)

02:14.768 --> 02:16.768
Touching those lasers
will trigger the alarm

02:16.770 --> 02:18.470
and this mission will
be a failure.

02:18.472 --> 02:19.738
ROBIN: Go!

02:23.109 --> 02:24.910
-Dude!
-The lasers!

02:24.912 --> 02:28.480
Please, I'm so cool,
these lasers ain't
even going to feel me.

02:28.482 --> 02:30.115
(ALARM BLARING)

02:32.151 --> 02:33.218
My bad.

02:35.254 --> 02:36.521

-(ALL SCREAMING)

02:38.392 --> 02:39.658
(BUZZER)

02:43.029 --> 02:45.063
We may have failed to acquire
the McGuffin,

02:45.065 --> 02:48.500
but we're not giving up.
It must be acquired
at all costs.

02:48.502 --> 02:50.669
You still haven't told us what
this McGuffin is exactly.

02:50.671 --> 02:53.405
Yeah, I haven't heard
of a McGuffin and I've
heard of a lot of things.

02:53.407 --> 02:55.507
Let's just say that it's
a desired object

02:55.509 --> 02:57.442
that for a long time has
both motivated me

02:57.444 --> 02:59.144
and driven my actions.

02:59.146 --> 03:01.913
That still does not inform us
of what it is.

03:01.915 --> 03:04.583
-I think it's Scotch.
-I've never heard of it.
He's saying it wrong.

03:04.585 --> 03:07.219
Whatevs!
Being a ninja is lame.

03:07.221 --> 03:11.122
Lame? What about all that
cool stuff we were doing
on the mission?

03:11.124 --> 03:13.325
I wasn't really paying
attention, bro.

03:13.327 --> 03:15.026
Then is this lame?

03:22.168 --> 03:23.835
Wow!

03:24.937 --> 03:26.571
Whoa.

03:30.076 --> 03:31.576
Sick!

03:31.578 --> 03:33.812
ALL: Ninja!

03:35.248 --> 03:36.948
So, what do you think now?

03:36.950 --> 03:39.384
You gots to teach me
the art of the Ninjajitsu.

03:39.386 --> 03:43.688
Very well. But you must swear
to follow my instructions
to the letter.

03:43.690 --> 03:45.957
And call me Master.

03:45.959 --> 03:48.159
How abouts I call you
Tiny Face?

03:48.794 --> 03:50.595
-No.
-(LAUGHS)

03:50.597 --> 03:52.364
Uh, Fish Lips?

03:52.366 --> 03:54.299
-No.
-Iron Buns?

03:54.301 --> 03:55.867
Hmm, no.

03:55.869 --> 03:58.370
Call me Master or forget
learning the Art of the Ninja.

03:58.372 --> 04:00.772
(GRUNTING)

04:00.774 --> 04:03.441
-Can't do it, Iron buns.
-Then I cannot teach you.

04:03.443 --> 04:05.911
-Ninjas, we go.
-See you, bro.

04:06.612 --> 04:08.613
(SQUEAKING)

04:08.615 --> 04:11.816
Uh, I'm not comfortable
by myself.

04:11.818 --> 04:14.486
I'll call you Master!
I'll call you Master!

04:14.488 --> 04:17.455
Then your training begins now.

04:17.457 --> 04:21.126

04:21.128 --> 04:23.962

in plain sight.

04:24.597 --> 04:26.064
Huh? Where did he go?

04:26.066 --> 04:27.132
Ninja!

04:28.000 --> 04:29.067
Ninja.

04:29.902 --> 04:31.436
Ninja.

04:31.438 --> 04:33.371
So ninja trippy!

04:33.373 --> 04:35.240
I know, right?

04:35.242 --> 04:37.208
Ninja!

04:37.210 --> 04:39.044

04:39.046 --> 04:41.780
You fools are blowing my mind!

04:42.248 --> 04:44.282
(ROBIN READING)

04:44.284 --> 04:48.286
Ninjas are masters
of both hand-to-hand
and thrown weapons.

04:48.288 --> 04:50.755
Most notably, the shuriken.

04:50.757 --> 04:53.058
(ALL READING)

04:53.060 --> 04:55.060
Oh, is that why Robin's
so short?

04:55.062 --> 04:57.596
-He was shurikened?
-He was born that way.

04:57.598 --> 04:59.698
If he was the shurikened,
he would be

04:59.700 --> 05:01.633
even smaller.

05:01.635 --> 05:05.370
Actually, shuriken is another
name for the throwing star.

05:05.372 --> 05:07.572
Oh, yeah.
That's what I'm talking about.

05:07.574 --> 05:08.740
-Ow!
-Careful.

05:08.742 --> 05:10.275
Ow, it's so pointy.

05:10.277 --> 05:12.911
Ha-ha, how are you supposed
to hold it? You take it.

Whoa.

05:17.618 --> 05:20.719
(ROBIN READING)

05:20.721 --> 05:24.389
I will test your stealth
by seeing if you can walk
across that bubble wrap

05:24.391 --> 05:26.024
without popping any bubbles.

05:28.594 --> 05:30.095
Observe.

05:34.400 --> 05:35.834
Now, you.

05:35.836 --> 05:39.037
(GIGGLES) Aw, yeah.

05:39.039 --> 05:40.171
No.

05:41.641 --> 05:43.308
(ALL LAUGHING)

05:45.578 --> 05:47.145
Oh, yeah.

05:47.147 --> 05:50.482
The pops are so satisfying.
I cannot stop.

05:50.484 --> 05:52.017
(CLAMORING)

05:52.019 --> 05:53.451
Enough!

05:53.453 --> 05:55.086
Take your training seriously.

05:55.088 --> 05:56.988
We have to capture
that McGuffin.

05:56.990 --> 05:59.024
Everything depends on it.
Now, train!

06:36.163 --> 06:38.630
Nah, I bet he's being
all stealthy.

06:38.632 --> 06:42.200
Excellent. Then I was able
to get him to embrace
the ninja life.

06:42.202 --> 06:46.004
Oh, Robin. You truly
are the Ninja Master.

06:46.006 --> 06:49.107
I have been the wrong
to dismiss your affections.

06:49.109 --> 06:52.310
I have the in loveness
with you.

06:56.415 --> 06:58.516

up together.

Enough! The student can't
become the master.

07:42.195 --> 07:45.063
-Whoever heard of that?
-Then, I'll prove I'm
the master.

07:45.065 --> 07:46.131
How?

07:46.133 --> 07:48.900
I'm going to get
that McGuffin first.

07:48.902 --> 07:50.835
(GASPS) You can't.

07:50.837 --> 07:52.504
It's too important.

goes down.

what it is and I still want
to get it so bad.

isn't the master.
Where is he anyway?

-Haven't seen him since
he gassed us.

-That is the McGuffin?
-This whole thing
was about a sandwich?

09:52.826 --> 09:55.093
Yes, a delicious egg sandwich.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.961
We did all this
for an Egg McGuffin?

09:56.963 --> 10:00.798
I know Beast Boy couldn't beat
me 'cause there's only
one master.
