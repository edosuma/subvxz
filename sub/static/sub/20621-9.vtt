WEBVTT

01:00.811 --> 01:01.979
Good, good.

01:02.104 --> 01:04.273
- Yeah, that's funny. That's funny.
- Mouth open?

01:04.356 --> 01:05.816
How about
back-to-back, guys?

01:05.900 --> 01:06.734
- Sure.
- All right.

01:06.817 --> 01:08.903
Yeah, good, good, good.
Yeah, ah, that's nice.

01:08.986 --> 01:10.780
Jeff, have a look
over your shoulder.

01:10.863 --> 01:12.073
There we go. Look at that.

01:12.156 --> 01:13.491
It's magic, gold
dust, gold dust.

01:13.574 --> 01:15.451
- Watch this.
- Right.

01:15.534 --> 01:18.204
Yeah, all right, guys.
We got the portraits.

01:18.287 --> 01:20.164
Let's have a little fun.

01:20.247 --> 01:21.957
I got some props here.
You guys like props?

01:22.041 --> 01:23.334
- Uh...
- Uh, no.

01:23.417 --> 01:25.086
Oh, come on, guys,
just one idea.

01:25.169 --> 01:26.295
That's all I need, just one.

01:26.378 --> 01:27.505
Let's give him his one idea.

01:27.588 --> 01:28.923
- You know what? Go ahead.
- I'll be right back.

01:29.006 --> 01:30.633
I got this great idea
you guys are gonna dig.

01:30.716 --> 01:31.717
- Okay, great.
- Great.

01:32.301 --> 01:35.346
So Francesca's coming by, huh?

01:35.429 --> 01:36.347
Interesting.

01:36.430 --> 01:37.765
It's not like that.

01:37.848 --> 01:40.559
She's engaged now.
I turned it off.

01:41.268 --> 01:42.394
Oh, you turned it off, huh?

01:42.478 --> 01:44.188
- Yeah, we're just friends.
- Okay.

01:44.271 --> 01:45.689
Well, just be careful, okay?

01:45.773 --> 01:47.358
I'm concerned for you.

01:47.441 --> 01:49.110
I'll be fine.

01:49.193 --> 01:50.694
All right, guys-.

01:50.778 --> 01:52.655
Let's have a little fun.

01:52.738 --> 01:54.532
All right. What
the fuck is this?

01:54.615 --> 01:56.242
It's a party sub.

01:56.325 --> 01:57.409
Let's party!

01:57.493 --> 01:58.744
Uh, Dev, let's get you inside.

01:58.828 --> 02:01.330
Jeff, let's get you around the
back, with your mouth wide open.

02:01.413 --> 02:03.082
Take a massive bite.

02:03.165 --> 02:03.999
Jeff, come on.

02:04.083 --> 02:05.709
- Just one?
- Yeah, come on, just one.

02:05.793 --> 02:07.128
All right.

02:07.211 --> 02:09.380
Come on, guys, let's give
him a hand in there.

02:09.463 --> 02:11.632
Let's get you nice, laid out
on that bed of tomatoes.

02:11.715 --> 02:12.842
- Beautiful.
- All right.

02:12.925 --> 02:14.218
Oh, my God.

02:14.301 --> 02:16.220
Oh, Jesus.

02:16.303 --> 02:18.305
That's great, yeah,
mouth wide open.

02:18.389 --> 02:19.765
Wider.

02:19.849 --> 02:21.142
Yeah, yeah-- Take a big bite.

02:21.225 --> 02:23.102
That's a really tasty sub.

02:23.185 --> 02:25.187
I-I really-- I don't
know about this, guys.

02:25.229 --> 02:27.022
Oh, guys, it looks great, though.
Come on.

02:27.106 --> 02:27.940
No, it's terrible.

02:28.023 --> 02:29.191
Come on, take that off.

02:29.275 --> 02:30.860
- Get out here, Dev.
- Yeah.

02:30.943 --> 02:31.986
- All right.
- Can you lift the bread up?

02:32.069 --> 02:33.404
- Thank you.
- Come on, buddy.

02:34.405 --> 02:36.240
Right, how about this, guys?

02:36.323 --> 02:38.284
I've got this giant bowl
of spaghetti, right?

02:38.367 --> 02:39.827
Both of you climb inside.

02:39.910 --> 02:41.203
You pop your head out
through the meatballs,

02:41.287 --> 02:42.663
and you look to each other like,

02:42.746 --> 02:44.331
"Hey, what's going on here?"

02:44.415 --> 02:46.542
- No, that's...
- Oh, wait, wait, wait, mock-up here.

02:49.461 --> 02:50.838
Okay. No.

02:50.921 --> 02:52.923
No? All right, I hear you.
I hear you.

02:53.007 --> 02:54.341
I got a really good idea.

02:54.425 --> 02:56.343
How about we-- We
call it a wrap here,

02:56.427 --> 02:57.928
we use the portraits
we took earlier,

02:58.012 --> 03:00.556
we slice up that sandwich,
call it lunch, okay?

03:00.639 --> 03:02.016
- Yeah, that works.
- All right, good.

03:04.518 --> 03:06.103
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:07.354 --> 03:08.898
- All right.
- Careful, Little D.

03:11.358 --> 03:12.276
Hi.

03:12.359 --> 03:13.652
Hi. Good to see you.

03:13.736 --> 03:14.653
Good to see you, too.

03:14.737 --> 03:15.696
Um, we just finished up.

03:15.779 --> 03:16.864
Uh, take care, Jeff.

03:16.947 --> 03:17.948
- See ya. Bye, guys.
- Bye.

03:18.032 --> 03:19.575
Thank you, everyone.

03:19.658 --> 03:22.912
- Everything all right?
- Yeah, uh-huh.

03:22.995 --> 03:24.705
So how is the new show going?

03:24.788 --> 03:26.749
It's good. Um...

03:26.832 --> 03:28.167
- We film four episodes...
- Mm-hmm.

03:28.250 --> 03:29.835
...and after this
little mini premiere,

03:29.919 --> 03:32.254
uh, we film the other
12 for the full season.

03:32.338 --> 03:33.923
Oh. That's cool.

03:34.006 --> 03:36.425
Yeah. So how long are
you here this trip?

03:36.508 --> 03:38.302
Um, about a month.

03:38.385 --> 03:39.887
Ah, that's great.

03:39.970 --> 03:42.514
Damn! Your girl fine.

03:42.598 --> 03:43.974
You know that, right?

03:44.058 --> 03:46.227
Got you an Indian dude.
I like it.

03:46.310 --> 03:48.479
What did he say?

03:48.562 --> 03:50.397
Uh, well, he thinks
we're together.

03:50.481 --> 03:54.485
And he's very excited that you're
dating someone of my ethnicity.

03:54.568 --> 03:55.861
- Really? This is what he said?
- Mm-hmm.

03:58.530 --> 03:59.740
I love it.

03:59.823 --> 04:02.660
Oh. It's me.

04:03.869 --> 04:05.079
- It's Pino.
- Oh.

04:05.162 --> 04:06.789
You can take it if you need to.

04:06.872 --> 04:08.916
No, I don't want to.

04:08.999 --> 04:10.292
- I'm mad at him.
- Uh-oh.

04:10.376 --> 04:11.961
We're arguing a lot.

04:12.044 --> 04:13.879
- Like, a lot.
- Oh.

04:13.963 --> 04:17.675
But since we are engaged, he's just
taking everything for granted.

04:17.758 --> 04:19.510
Oh, I'm sorry.

04:19.593 --> 04:20.552
Yeah, I know.

04:20.636 --> 04:21.679
Like, this trip, for example,

04:21.762 --> 04:23.973
he's gonna be in Boston
and then Philadelphia,

04:24.056 --> 04:26.433
all those works,
meetings everywhere,

04:26.517 --> 04:28.310
and I'm gonna be on
my own all the time.

04:28.394 --> 04:29.561
Aw. Well, I'll be here.

04:31.981 --> 04:32.898
That's true.

04:34.692 --> 04:37.528
Um, are you guys gonna do
any fun New York stuff?

04:37.611 --> 04:40.114
Well, we're supposed to go

04:40.197 --> 04:42.783
to this cool museum upstate.

04:42.866 --> 04:43.951
It's called Storm King.

04:44.034 --> 04:45.119
Have you ever been there?

04:45.202 --> 04:46.745
No, I've heard it's
great, though.

04:46.829 --> 04:48.455
Yes, this is what I heard, too.

04:48.539 --> 04:49.665
I can't wait.

04:49.748 --> 04:52.293
- I have a fun trip if you're up for it.
- Mm-hmm?

04:52.376 --> 04:54.920
My friend Lawrence that worked
on Clash of the Cupcakes with me

04:55.004 --> 04:56.797
got me a parting gift--

04:56.880 --> 05:00.301
a helicopter tour
of New York City!

05:00.384 --> 05:01.218
Really?

05:01.302 --> 05:02.761
Yeah, you want to go?

05:02.845 --> 05:03.887
- Can I?
- Yeah.

05:03.971 --> 05:06.515
- Can I come with you?
- Yes.

05:06.598 --> 05:07.433
Awesome!

05:07.516 --> 05:10.102
I mean, I lo-- I never been
to a helicopter before.

05:10.185 --> 05:11.729
Yeah, me neither. I've had
the certificate forever.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.731
- I got to use it at some point.
- That would be so cool.

05:15.774 --> 05:16.734
Oh, my God.

05:16.817 --> 05:17.943
Can we go in?

05:18.027 --> 05:19.737
Please? Please? Please?

05:19.820 --> 05:20.904
Can we?

05:20.988 --> 05:22.323
Uh, yeah, sure.

05:23.198 --> 05:24.825
Oh, thank you.

05:27.202 --> 05:28.412
Wow.

05:29.621 --> 05:30.998
I love this place.

05:31.081 --> 05:33.125
Why are you freaking out?

05:33.208 --> 05:34.793
Because I love pharmacies--

05:34.877 --> 05:37.463
and in Italy are
so tiny and old,

05:37.546 --> 05:40.549
and here are so big, and you
can have everything you need.

05:40.632 --> 05:41.550
Look at this.

05:41.633 --> 05:43.552
Look how many toothpastes
you can have.

05:43.635 --> 05:44.553
A lot of them.

05:44.636 --> 05:45.721
I love it.

05:45.804 --> 05:48.223
Oh, miniatures.

05:48.307 --> 05:51.185
Aw, oh, I love miniatures.

05:51.268 --> 05:52.853
Look at this.

05:54.271 --> 05:56.065
Wow.

05:56.148 --> 05:58.942
Little, tiny Vaseline.

05:59.026 --> 06:00.778
This is so cute.

06:00.861 --> 06:03.572
I should take one as a gift
for my friend Lucrezzia.

06:03.655 --> 06:05.366
Kind of a shitty gift, no?

06:05.449 --> 06:07.951
Mm, you're right.

06:08.035 --> 06:09.161
I'm gonna take two.

06:09.244 --> 06:10.204
Mm.

06:10.287 --> 06:14.375
Oh, creme brulee flavor.

06:14.458 --> 06:17.586
That means that when you kiss someone,
you're gonna taste creme brulee.

06:17.669 --> 06:18.504
Ooh.

06:18.587 --> 06:20.464
French kiss.

06:21.673 --> 06:23.050
I love this place.

06:23.133 --> 06:24.343
I just want to live here.

06:24.426 --> 06:25.844
Can we stay here forever?

06:25.928 --> 06:27.721
It'd be an odd
New York itinerary.

06:27.805 --> 06:31.433
Oh, look how many medicine
you have over here.

06:31.517 --> 06:33.811
I mean, that's my paradise.

06:36.188 --> 06:37.773
Look.

06:37.856 --> 06:41.443
Look how many diarrhea medicines
you can have in America.

06:41.527 --> 06:43.404
You can have the green one

06:43.487 --> 06:46.490
or the pink one.

06:46.573 --> 06:48.409
What's that?

06:48.492 --> 06:50.994
Chocolate diarrhea medicine?

06:51.078 --> 06:55.124
Means that you can eat chocolate and
you're gonna stop having diarrhea?

06:56.959 --> 06:58.377
Dev...

06:58.460 --> 07:01.130
this is an amazing
time to be alive.

07:02.131 --> 07:05.384
Especially if you're having
issues with your bowel movements.

07:09.388 --> 07:13.392
Can I eat this chocolate even
if I don't have diarrhea?

07:19.273 --> 07:21.733
Wow. You really
bought a lot of shit.

07:21.817 --> 07:24.445
Well, I told you I
love pharmacies.

07:25.571 --> 07:27.322
What you doing now? You
want to get a bite to eat?

07:27.406 --> 07:29.283
No, I can't. I have
to see Pino now.

07:29.366 --> 07:30.200
Oh.

07:30.284 --> 07:32.536
But he's going to Boston
on Thursday night.

07:32.619 --> 07:33.871
So do you want to have a dinner?

07:33.954 --> 07:35.998
Uh, sure. What do
you want to eat?

07:36.081 --> 07:37.082
Italian food.

07:37.166 --> 07:39.293
- Ugh, you're so Italian sometimes.
- I know.

07:39.376 --> 07:40.752
What about something else?

07:40.836 --> 07:42.963
How about, uh, tapas?

07:43.046 --> 07:44.173
Do you like tapas?

07:44.256 --> 07:45.466
Uh, I like eating tapas.

07:45.549 --> 07:46.675
I like saying tapas.

07:46.758 --> 07:48.051
I love everything about tapas.

07:48.135 --> 07:49.928
Okay, then let's do tapas.

07:50.012 --> 07:51.889
'Tapas night! 'Tapas night!

07:59.605 --> 08:01.106
- Hello.
- Hi.

08:01.190 --> 08:03.025
There's two of us. How long
do you think the wait'll be?

08:03.108 --> 08:04.109
It's gonna be about an hour.

08:04.193 --> 08:05.486
And also the kitchen
closes at 10:00 tonight,

08:05.569 --> 08:06.695
so you may not even make it.

08:06.778 --> 08:08.238
I'm so sorry.

08:08.322 --> 08:09.656
What do we do?

08:09.740 --> 08:11.366
I gotta have my tapas.
I just gotta.

08:11.450 --> 08:12.701
Me too.

08:12.784 --> 08:14.244
I don't know. Should we wait?

08:14.328 --> 08:15.829
What if the kitchen closes?

08:15.913 --> 08:17.372
Uh, should we just go
to the people and say,

08:17.456 --> 08:18.582
"Come on, eat faster, faster"?

08:18.665 --> 08:20.000
That's a good idea. Hold on.

08:20.083 --> 08:21.335
Finish your food!

08:21.418 --> 08:23.128
Sorry. Just joking.

08:23.212 --> 08:25.672
- Sorry.
- Take your time.

08:25.756 --> 08:27.591
All right, I think
we'll make it.

08:27.674 --> 08:29.676
I have faith. I know we will.

08:29.760 --> 08:31.929
Okay, let's put our
name down for it.

08:38.393 --> 08:40.187
What's up? Is anyone
about to finish?

08:40.229 --> 08:41.730
What about that
couple over there?

08:41.813 --> 08:43.899
Uh, I think they're
ordering more.

08:43.982 --> 08:45.943
Those tapas-loving fucks!

08:47.069 --> 08:49.821
Also, this Asian
couple is ahead of us.

08:49.905 --> 08:51.949
It's 9:45. We're
never gonna make it.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.575
Whoa, come on. You
can't talk like that.

08:53.659 --> 08:55.160
You got to have faith.
We're gonna be fine.

08:55.244 --> 08:56.161
- I promise, all right?
- Mm-hmm.

08:56.245 --> 08:58.288
Look at these guys. They're losing faith.
They're about to leave.

08:58.372 --> 08:59.540
- No.
- Look at them. I can tell.

08:59.623 --> 09:02.376
They're sitting there like, "Oh, I can't
believe we waited this long for tapas.

09:02.459 --> 09:03.377
I didn't even want tapas."

09:03.460 --> 09:05.754
"What are you talking about? You're
the one that suggested tapas."

09:05.837 --> 09:07.172
"No, I suggested Thai food."

09:07.256 --> 09:09.383
"Oh, I can't believe this. I
should have never married you.

09:09.466 --> 09:11.385
I should have listened
to my father."

09:11.468 --> 09:12.761
See? They're leaving.

09:12.844 --> 09:15.389
They're leaving. They're leaving.
They're leaving.

09:15.472 --> 09:16.390
They're leaving.

09:16.473 --> 09:17.975
They're leaving.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.935
They left.

09:20.018 --> 09:21.270
I told you.

09:22.646 --> 09:24.731
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

09:24.815 --> 09:26.483
No, you have to tap first.

09:26.567 --> 09:29.027
Cheers, tap.

09:29.111 --> 09:30.153
And drink.

09:31.697 --> 09:32.781
What happens if you don't tap?

09:32.864 --> 09:34.575
If you don't tap and
don't look in the eyes,

09:34.658 --> 09:36.577
it's, like, seven
years of bad sex.

09:36.660 --> 09:37.995
Oh, no.

09:38.078 --> 09:39.580
- You don't want that, right?
- No.

09:39.663 --> 09:40.956
What happens if you do this?

09:41.039 --> 09:43.250
Cheers...

09:44.501 --> 09:45.961
That's solo sex.

09:46.044 --> 09:49.006
Seven years of fantastic
masturbation.

09:50.674 --> 09:52.676
Okay basta, it's enough for you.

09:52.759 --> 09:53.885
Don't drink anymore.

09:53.969 --> 09:55.721
You're drunk.

09:57.848 --> 09:59.808
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

09:59.891 --> 10:01.018
This is really good.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.019
I told you.

10:02.102 --> 10:05.188
Aren't you glad you expanded your
culinary horizons beyond Italian?

10:05.272 --> 10:06.898
- Yes, I am.
- Mm-hmm.

10:06.982 --> 10:08.525
You were right.

10:08.609 --> 10:10.152
What else should I try
while I'm in New York?

10:10.235 --> 10:11.903
Mm...

10:13.113 --> 10:14.531
Indian food?

10:14.615 --> 10:16.283
Mm, I don't really like curry.

10:16.366 --> 10:18.952
- Racist.
- I said I don't like curry food.

10:19.036 --> 10:20.454
I didn't say I don't
like curry people.

10:20.537 --> 10:23.415
All right, I was kidding earlier,
but the phrase "curry people" --

10:23.498 --> 10:24.625
definitely racist.

10:24.708 --> 10:25.792
I'm not racist.

10:25.876 --> 10:26.918
You can't say "curry person."

10:27.002 --> 10:28.045
I-I'm not a curry person.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.672
I'm not defined by the
flavors my people enjoy.

10:30.756 --> 10:31.673
Okay, I didn't say--

10:31.757 --> 10:34.593
What do you call Chinese people?
Soy sauce people?

10:34.676 --> 10:35.802
No.

10:35.886 --> 10:37.220
I don't call them like this.

10:37.304 --> 10:38.597
Oh. Well...

10:38.680 --> 10:40.140
even though you are
a little racist...

10:40.223 --> 10:41.558
...I'm glad you're here.

10:41.642 --> 10:42.643
It's fun hanging out
with you again.

10:42.726 --> 10:44.686
Yes, it is. I missed it.

11:36.613 --> 11:37.614
- Hey.
- Hmm?

11:37.698 --> 11:38.949
Let's play a game.

11:39.032 --> 11:42.119
Let's pretend we're a couple,
but we're in a huge argument.

11:42.202 --> 11:43.995
Uh, what do you mean?

11:44.079 --> 11:45.038
Uh...

11:45.122 --> 11:47.374
like this, like this, like this.

11:47.457 --> 11:49.751
I can't believe you fucked
him on the Ping-Pong table!

11:49.835 --> 11:51.878
The one I got for our
anniversary, how could you?

11:51.962 --> 11:55.298
Well, I'm sorry, but you
were sleeping in our bed!

11:55.382 --> 11:57.509
- Where are we supposed to go?
- Uh, anywhere else!

11:57.592 --> 12:00.262
Oh, really? So next time,
I will do that! Thanks!

12:01.638 --> 12:03.557
All right, you do one.
You start one.

12:03.640 --> 12:05.434
- Uh, okay, okay.
- Yeah.

12:06.560 --> 12:08.270
You gave our dog a blow job?

12:08.353 --> 12:10.147
No, I did not do that.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.441
Yes, you did! I saw the video.

12:12.524 --> 12:14.735
You were giving a
blow job to the dog!

12:14.818 --> 12:16.153
- No. That's too far.
- Poor dog!

12:16.236 --> 12:17.946
- Shit, I think that is him.
- You can't do that.

12:18.029 --> 12:20.323
Hey, yo! Clash of the
Cupcakes rules, baby!

12:20.407 --> 12:22.117
- Hey, can we get a pic?
- Oh, shit.

12:22.200 --> 12:23.410
- Can we get a pic?
- Uh, no, I'm sorry!

12:23.493 --> 12:25.287
Um, so sorry.

12:25.370 --> 12:26.872
Just run away from this guy.

12:26.955 --> 12:28.331
Those guys think I blew a dog.

12:28.415 --> 12:29.374
- I know.
- Thank you very much.

12:29.458 --> 12:32.753
I'm sorry. I think I just
ruined your reputation forever.

12:32.836 --> 12:33.962
I'm a public figure, Francesca.

12:34.045 --> 12:36.465
- I host a very popular cupcake show.
- Now hide behind the tree.

12:38.049 --> 12:39.092
Shh.

12:39.176 --> 12:40.552
I think they know we're here.

12:40.635 --> 12:41.762
It's not a very
good hiding place.

12:41.845 --> 12:43.221
I think so, too.

12:43.305 --> 12:45.015
Hold on. Let's see
if they're coming.

12:45.891 --> 12:47.184
Okay, they're not.

12:47.267 --> 12:48.560
I'm so sorry.

12:48.643 --> 12:49.978
It's okay.

12:50.061 --> 12:51.980
I think I won the game.

12:52.063 --> 12:53.940
Yes, you did.

12:54.024 --> 12:55.400
I did. I did.

12:55.484 --> 12:57.694
Fun game, though.

13:01.114 --> 13:03.116
This is exciting, man.

13:03.200 --> 13:05.327
This is scandalous.

13:05.410 --> 13:08.205
But I got to be honest-- I saw
this coming from a mile away.

13:08.288 --> 13:10.207
You guys have a connection.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.959
There's always
been a vibe, right?

13:13.043 --> 13:14.544
Yeah, but she's engaged.

13:14.628 --> 13:15.712
I know.

13:15.796 --> 13:19.466
But she doesn't seem
into it, you know?

13:19.549 --> 13:20.884
She has one foot out the door.

13:20.967 --> 13:23.804
I mean, it's maybe not out the
door, but it's near the doorway.

13:23.887 --> 13:26.515
And when we're together,
oh, it's great.

13:26.598 --> 13:27.766
It feels so good.

13:27.849 --> 13:29.017
There's an energy.

13:29.100 --> 13:30.727
I felt it after the
Chef Jeff dinner.

13:30.811 --> 13:31.812
I felt it tonight.

13:31.853 --> 13:32.771
Yeah.

13:32.854 --> 13:35.190
Tonight definitely seemed
more romantic than friendly.

13:35.273 --> 13:37.234
I would play it cool for
the next couple weeks

13:37.317 --> 13:38.735
and see where it goes.

13:38.819 --> 13:42.197
By the way, I just popped a Lunesta, so
I might be a little sleepy in a bit.

13:42.280 --> 13:44.241
Hold on.

13:44.324 --> 13:47.452
- Incoming, Francesca!
- Ooh.

13:47.536 --> 13:49.204
"I had so much fun tonight.

13:49.287 --> 13:51.081
Thanks for a wonderful evening."

13:51.164 --> 13:52.958
Kissy emoji.

13:53.041 --> 13:54.000
We got kissies?

13:54.084 --> 13:55.585
♪ We got kissies ♪

13:55.669 --> 13:57.170
♪ We got kissies ♪

13:57.254 --> 13:58.672
Hold on, hold on.

13:58.755 --> 14:01.132
"I'm having a small
birthday party for Pino.

14:01.216 --> 14:02.717
Can you come?"

14:02.801 --> 14:05.762
I don't want to go
to no Pino party.

14:05.846 --> 14:07.639
Hell no, you're not
going to that party.

14:07.722 --> 14:09.349
But...

14:10.642 --> 14:12.394
maybe it'd be good to go

14:12.477 --> 14:13.979
to kind of feel out
what their vibe is.

14:14.104 --> 14:15.981
No.No.No.

14:16.064 --> 14:17.607
You're definitely not going.

14:17.691 --> 14:19.442
I don't understand. Why
isn't it a good idea?

14:19.526 --> 14:20.861
You're being a little baby.

14:20.944 --> 14:21.862
What?

14:21.945 --> 14:23.280
"I need to be around her.

14:23.363 --> 14:24.698
We have such good chemistry."

14:24.781 --> 14:25.615
No.

14:25.699 --> 14:27.784
Number one, her bozo
fiance's gonna be there.

14:27.868 --> 14:30.245
Number two, from now
on, you're triple B--

14:30.328 --> 14:32.622
busy, beautiful, badass.

14:32.706 --> 14:34.791
Fine.

14:36.293 --> 14:39.087
"I'll try, but I
might not make it."

14:39.170 --> 14:40.672
Good.

14:40.755 --> 14:42.257
She's writing back.

14:42.340 --> 14:43.842
She's writing back.

14:43.925 --> 14:46.553
♪ She's writing back to me ♪

14:48.054 --> 14:51.600
"Please come. I really
want to see you."

14:51.683 --> 14:53.435
Then she threw in a
couple more emojis.

14:53.518 --> 14:56.229
- What kind of emoji?
- This guy.

14:56.313 --> 14:57.480
That's huggy, bro.

14:57.564 --> 14:59.900
Get that fucking
huggy away from me.

14:59.983 --> 15:01.318
I want kissy,

15:01.401 --> 15:04.571
or I want red hearts only.

15:04.654 --> 15:05.906
Ah, come on, man. Let's just go.

15:05.989 --> 15:08.450
It'll be good to see
what's up with them.

15:08.533 --> 15:11.077
All right, I'll go with you.
It's fine.

15:11.161 --> 15:12.412
You Okay?

15:12.495 --> 15:14.873
I think my Lunesta's
kicking in hard,

15:14.956 --> 15:16.958
and I just got to
take a little nap.

15:17.042 --> 15:18.919
All right, well, I'll
probably head out.

15:19.002 --> 15:19.920
Cap...

15:20.003 --> 15:21.421
will you tuck me in?

15:23.256 --> 15:24.633
I'm not tucking you in.

15:24.716 --> 15:28.553
The problem is I don't have my
sheets on me, and I'm cold.

15:28.637 --> 15:30.847
Come on, man. I
can't tuck you in.

15:32.974 --> 15:34.142
But...

15:35.685 --> 15:37.896
maybe I can throw a
little blankie on you.

15:45.445 --> 15:47.447
Night-night, buddy.

15:48.365 --> 15:49.866
Night-night.

15:56.247 --> 15:58.375
I'm starting to
get a little freaked out.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.168
I think it's gonna be weird
seeing her together with him.

16:00.251 --> 16:01.962
Yeah, I told you this
was a terrible idea.

16:02.045 --> 16:04.214
But then you agreed it'd be
good to check out the vibe.

16:04.297 --> 16:06.591
That was Lunesta Arnold.
You never trust that guy.

16:06.675 --> 16:09.052
By the way, thanks for that tuck-in.

16:10.136 --> 16:11.805
- Dev, hey.
- Hey, happy birthday, Pino.

16:11.888 --> 16:13.515
Hey, thank you. Nice
to see you.Ciao.

16:13.598 --> 16:15.183
- DiGiorno.
- Ciao.

16:15.266 --> 16:18.103
So, looks like the who's who of
the Northeast tile market here.

16:18.186 --> 16:20.146
Listen, Syed Ahamed is here.

16:20.230 --> 16:21.856
He's the marble king
of the Southeast.

16:21.940 --> 16:24.275
Believe me, he's a legend.

16:24.359 --> 16:27.237
Uh, should I ask him about
how he did the fireplace

16:27.320 --> 16:29.531
at the Park Hyatt
hotel in Shanghai?

16:29.614 --> 16:32.409
No, maybe-- I mean, it's too obvious.
Everybody ask him about that.

16:32.492 --> 16:33.994
- Yeah, probably.
- Hey, guys. Hi.

16:34.077 --> 16:35.161
- Hi.
- Hey.

16:35.245 --> 16:36.329
Thanks for coming.

16:36.413 --> 16:37.414
Yeah.

16:37.497 --> 16:38.999
Come on, come on,
let's have a drink.

16:39.082 --> 16:40.041
All right.

16:43.086 --> 16:45.171
You know which stone you
should use for your fireplace?

16:45.255 --> 16:46.214
Hmm?

16:46.297 --> 16:48.133
Black Galaxy. What do you think?

16:48.216 --> 16:50.719
That'll be good, but he
can use Carrara, too.

16:50.802 --> 16:51.720
Carrara will look better.

16:53.805 --> 16:55.765
See? He's the king, I told you.

16:55.849 --> 16:58.435
- Carrara is wonderful idea.
- That sounds really cool.

16:58.518 --> 17:00.603
I just don't have a
fireplace in my apartment.

17:00.687 --> 17:01.646
Oh. What a shame.

17:01.730 --> 17:04.441
If you don't have a fireplace,
at least do your kitchen, Arnold.

17:04.524 --> 17:08.486
Yeah. Once he did a
countertop for a football player...

17:08.570 --> 17:10.655
for the Miami Dolphin. Hmm?

17:10.739 --> 17:12.490
We cut the island in
the shape of the dolphin,

17:12.574 --> 17:14.576
and it was very good,
means, very good.

17:14.659 --> 17:17.746
Uh, I love lasers.

17:17.829 --> 17:20.123
Wonderful. So?

17:20.206 --> 17:22.083
I'm renting right now,

17:22.167 --> 17:23.668
and I just don't want to put
a couple thousand dollars

17:23.752 --> 17:25.879
into a dolphin-shaped
countertop.

17:25.962 --> 17:27.881
No, no, no, no, no.
It's not expensive.

17:27.964 --> 17:31.009
It's not. You know, at least you
can do the bathroom countertops?

17:31.092 --> 17:32.218
Yeah.

17:32.302 --> 17:33.887
Hey! Guys.

17:33.970 --> 17:37.265
Can I humbly request a
tile-talk moratorium?

17:37.348 --> 17:40.018
Meaning we talk about anything
besides tiles for a little while?

17:40.101 --> 17:41.186
Oh, yes, please.

17:41.269 --> 17:42.103
I'm sorry.

17:42.228 --> 17:43.813
We brought work to the party.

17:43.897 --> 17:47.275
It's-- It's just I'm-- I'm
overexcited that Syed, you're here!

17:47.358 --> 17:49.027
My friend. Great.

17:50.153 --> 17:51.404
- Syed.
- I know, I know.

17:51.488 --> 17:52.822
Yeah, yeah, si, si.

17:52.906 --> 17:56.326
Syed, Syed...

17:56.409 --> 17:57.410
I'm talking in Italian
with my wife.

17:57.494 --> 17:58.495
- Sorry.
- Uh...

17:58.578 --> 18:00.663
No, I'm not married yet.

18:00.747 --> 18:03.208
- My future. In the future, maybe.
- Yes.

18:03.291 --> 18:05.210
- You never know with Italians, you know.
- Yeah.

18:05.293 --> 18:07.378
- Maybe one day.
- Okay.

18:07.462 --> 18:09.130
B-by the way-- Sorry.

18:09.214 --> 18:12.300
Uh, the countertop in the bathroom,
I think it's a good idea.

18:12.383 --> 18:14.052
- Let's do it.
- It's cheap, not expensive.

18:14.135 --> 18:15.512
What you think?

18:15.595 --> 18:17.472
Can you cut other animal shapes?

18:17.555 --> 18:19.766
Yeah, with the laser,
we can cut anything you want.

18:19.849 --> 18:21.893
And if you have any favorite
animals, we can cut it.

18:21.976 --> 18:23.561
Well, I did have
a lizard named Lucien

18:23.603 --> 18:25.063
that might look cool there.

18:25.146 --> 18:28.108
We have some green jade. We can
put a lizard into the countertop.

18:28.191 --> 18:29.567
- Yeah.
- It would look good.

18:31.027 --> 18:33.154
Captain's update.

18:33.238 --> 18:35.657
Look at this.

18:35.740 --> 18:38.118
Whoa. You guys are
doing secret texts?

18:38.201 --> 18:40.078
Yes.

18:40.161 --> 18:41.538
Look.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.248
Is that you and her dancing?

18:43.331 --> 18:44.958
I don't see no Pino emoji.

18:45.041 --> 18:46.167
I just see my little bud.

18:46.251 --> 18:47.293
Mm-hmm.

18:47.377 --> 18:48.837
Scroll down.

18:48.920 --> 18:51.381
Oh, my fucking God.

18:51.464 --> 18:54.551
You bopped a kissy emoji
at Pino's birthday party?

18:54.634 --> 18:56.469
Ooh, you're a bad boy.

18:56.553 --> 18:57.387
I know.

18:57.470 --> 19:00.223
And guess what she did
after I sent the kissy.

19:00.306 --> 19:01.224
What?

19:01.307 --> 19:03.351
She winked at me.

19:03.434 --> 19:05.061
Casual wink or flirty wink?

19:05.186 --> 19:06.062
Flirty.

19:06.146 --> 19:07.105
Like this?

19:07.188 --> 19:08.565
No, like this.

19:08.648 --> 19:09.899
Ooh, baby!

19:09.983 --> 19:11.234
This is huge, man.

19:11.317 --> 19:12.318
I know.

19:12.402 --> 19:14.404
What do you think? Should I put
in a little face time now?

19:14.487 --> 19:15.488
Absolutely.

19:15.572 --> 19:17.574
Where is she?

19:20.034 --> 19:22.787
Fuck! She's
canoodling with Pino.

19:22.871 --> 19:24.914
Dude, triple B.

19:24.998 --> 19:28.001
Let's get out of here. Let's move on.

19:28.084 --> 19:30.670
All right. Let's just,
like, wave goodbye.

19:36.050 --> 19:37.135
All right.

20:32.440 --> 20:33.650
Holy shit.

20:33.733 --> 20:35.860
This is amazing.

20:35.944 --> 20:36.945
Wow.

20:38.321 --> 20:39.656
Beautiful.

20:50.333 --> 20:52.418
Thanks for inviting me to this.

20:52.502 --> 20:53.795
Thanks for coming along.

20:56.214 --> 20:58.675
So...

20:58.758 --> 21:01.386
What is the Wi-Fi password?

21:05.431 --> 21:06.724
Ah, this is awesome.

21:08.226 --> 21:09.644
Look at this.

21:09.727 --> 21:10.937
I never do anything.

21:11.020 --> 21:13.147
I never go to stuff.
This is great.

21:13.231 --> 21:15.024
You just go to
restaurant and eat.

21:15.108 --> 21:17.860
I know!
'Cause I'm always hungry.

21:17.944 --> 21:19.487
Take a picture of me.

21:19.570 --> 21:20.488
All right, all right.

21:20.571 --> 21:21.990
I'm gonna
be underneath, okay?

21:22.073 --> 21:23.658
All right, okay, okay.

21:23.741 --> 21:25.410
Wow.

21:25.493 --> 21:26.869
So cool.

21:26.953 --> 21:28.746
Mm, can we stay here forever?

21:30.707 --> 21:33.126
I mean, no disrespect
to the art, but...

21:33.209 --> 21:36.296
the red leaves are
really awesome.

21:36.379 --> 21:37.463
I'm gonna give you a gift.

21:37.547 --> 21:38.840
- Close your eyes.
- Okay.

21:42.552 --> 21:44.012
Open.

21:45.847 --> 21:47.390
Thank you. What a nice gift.

21:47.473 --> 21:49.517
And ano-- Another one?

21:49.600 --> 21:52.562
Here we go. Autumn in New York.

21:52.645 --> 21:53.855
One, two, three.

21:55.398 --> 21:58.109
Uno, due, tre.

21:58.192 --> 22:00.987
- How's it?
- Good. Va bene.

22:01.070 --> 22:02.613
Let me see.

22:04.449 --> 22:06.534
- Okay, let me...
- All right, you got to clean me up.

22:08.077 --> 22:09.245
Let me...

22:11.914 --> 22:12.832
Okay.

22:12.915 --> 22:14.292
You look cute.

22:14.375 --> 22:17.170
I'm gonna leave you like this with
the little leaves around you.

22:17.253 --> 22:18.880
- Mm-hmm?
- Then I'm gonna...

22:18.963 --> 22:22.258
just let people think that
you are my piece of art.

22:22.342 --> 22:23.259
All right.

22:24.052 --> 22:25.636
Come on! Are you racing?

22:25.720 --> 22:28.056
I am racing! I'm
just really, really bad!

22:28.139 --> 22:29.640
You're so slow!

22:29.724 --> 22:32.143
No,
it's just bad, see?

22:32.226 --> 22:34.312
Are you saving your
energy for the later part?

22:34.395 --> 22:35.521
Yes, I think so.

22:35.605 --> 22:38.232
I feel like you should probably
start going now, though, no?

22:38.316 --> 22:39.609
I guess you won!

22:39.692 --> 22:41.277
I guess I win.

22:44.322 --> 22:45.239
I won!

22:45.323 --> 22:46.449
You did!

22:47.575 --> 22:49.619
I'm kind of tired.

22:49.702 --> 22:51.120
Can you carry me on your
shoulders for a little while?

22:51.204 --> 22:52.288
No. Not at all.

22:52.372 --> 22:53.414
And by the way, I'm the girl.

22:53.498 --> 22:55.208
I should be carry-on, not you.

22:55.291 --> 22:57.210
- I'll carry you.
- Really?

22:57.293 --> 22:58.586
You know what?
Here, let's do it.

22:58.669 --> 22:59.587
You don't think I can do it?

22:59.670 --> 23:01.005
I think you--

23:01.089 --> 23:03.007
No, don't run!

23:05.093 --> 23:06.886
No, no, no, no, no, no!
Okay, okay, okay.

23:06.969 --> 23:08.012
You can do it. You
definitely can do it.

23:08.096 --> 23:10.681
- I told you. You didn't believe me.
- Go! Run!

23:13.309 --> 23:15.186
You know what,
this is the longest time

23:15.228 --> 23:18.022
I've been without actually
working in the shop with Nonna.

23:18.106 --> 23:19.065
Whoa.

23:19.148 --> 23:21.192
How's it feel not to
make pasta every day?

23:21.859 --> 23:23.736
Uh...

23:23.820 --> 23:25.863
good.

23:25.947 --> 23:28.574
I feel so bad saying it.

23:28.658 --> 23:30.493
Don't feel bad.

23:30.576 --> 23:32.078
Can I ask you...

23:32.161 --> 23:35.373
it sounds like you never really
pursued the whole art history thing.

23:35.456 --> 23:38.334
Um, why did you start
working at the shop?

23:40.211 --> 23:45.299
My mom passed away when I finished school,
so I had to help Nonna in the shop,

23:45.383 --> 23:46.968
and I never left.

23:47.051 --> 23:48.094
Oh.

23:48.177 --> 23:49.512
You think you could leave now?

23:49.595 --> 23:51.389
Maybe Mario can take over.
He seems ready.

23:51.472 --> 23:52.557
Mario?

23:52.640 --> 23:54.183
He's definitely ready to eat.

23:56.352 --> 23:58.646
- No.
- Seriously, have you ever thought about...

23:58.729 --> 24:00.857
doing something else?
Living somewhere else?

24:00.940 --> 24:02.567
Move to New York.

24:02.650 --> 24:03.818
Yeah, I wish,

24:03.901 --> 24:05.987
but I have Pino with me.

24:06.070 --> 24:09.282
I mean, unless I convince
him to move over here,

24:09.365 --> 24:12.952
I just think we're gonna
start our life in Modena,

24:13.035 --> 24:15.121
have family, kids.

24:15.204 --> 24:16.456
Yeah.

24:16.539 --> 24:19.083
Yeah.

24:19.167 --> 24:21.252
Congratulations on the
engagement, by the way.

24:21.335 --> 24:23.129
- Tell you in person.
- Thank you. Thank you.

24:23.212 --> 24:24.672
Thank you.

24:24.755 --> 24:27.216
He finally proposed.

24:27.800 --> 24:30.011
Yeah. Well, how long has it been?
Ten years?

24:30.094 --> 24:31.220
Yes, ten years.

24:31.304 --> 24:32.430
Wow.

24:32.513 --> 24:34.307
Ten years.

24:34.390 --> 24:36.476
I mean, this is
what you do, right?

24:36.559 --> 24:39.270
After ten years that
you are with a person,

24:39.353 --> 24:41.147
YOU just...

24:41.230 --> 24:42.982
you just get married.

24:44.692 --> 24:46.194
Right?

24:48.279 --> 24:49.614
How did he propose?

24:49.697 --> 24:52.116
Did he pull out all the stops?

24:52.200 --> 24:53.701
Do you know what "pull out
all the stops" means?

24:53.784 --> 24:54.619
Yes, I do.

24:54.702 --> 24:56.329
How do you know that and you
don't know what cashews are?

24:56.412 --> 24:58.581
I don't know. I just do.

24:59.540 --> 25:00.500
Wait. What cashews is?

25:00.583 --> 25:01.709
They're nuts.

25:01.792 --> 25:03.711
- They're just those curved nuts.
- Okay.

25:03.794 --> 25:05.129
Okay.

25:05.213 --> 25:06.714
So tell me. Set the scene.
What did he do?

25:06.797 --> 25:08.549
We got candles?
What's happening?

25:09.592 --> 25:12.345
Um, he propose in the elevator.

25:14.013 --> 25:15.348
- What?
- Hey, no, it's nice.

25:15.431 --> 25:17.433
It's-- It's simple.

25:17.517 --> 25:19.393
It's elegant. It's intimate.

25:19.477 --> 25:21.521
Yes, just right
after the grocery.

25:22.605 --> 25:24.315
Why are you laughing for?

25:24.398 --> 25:25.858
No, it's nice. It's very unique.

25:25.942 --> 25:27.151
It's...

25:27.235 --> 25:28.361
it's a good proposal.

25:28.444 --> 25:29.779
Mm-hmm.

25:29.862 --> 25:32.823
Hey, it's not about the proposal.
It's about the guy, right?

25:33.574 --> 25:36.035
Pino is a very unique person.

25:37.745 --> 25:38.788
He is.

26:26.460 --> 26:27.837
Can we eat something else?

26:27.920 --> 26:29.171
We just ate pasta.

26:29.255 --> 26:32.133
I know, but now we
need a movie food.

26:32.216 --> 26:33.884
Ooh... want to get some popcorn?

26:33.968 --> 26:35.469
- Yes.
- Mm.

26:37.096 --> 26:40.182
Mm, but it's pretty bad outside.

26:40.266 --> 26:42.977
Oof, yeah.

26:43.060 --> 26:45.521
It's okay. Let's just stay in.

26:45.605 --> 26:46.606
Sure.

26:58.075 --> 27:00.244
Can I have the blanket?
It's a bit cold.

27:00.328 --> 27:01.495
Of course.

27:07.918 --> 27:10.755
Thank y-o-o-o...

27:10.838 --> 27:12.923
I got to warn you, though--
once you put this blanket on,

27:13.007 --> 27:16.260
you will leave New
York City and enter...

27:16.344 --> 27:17.261
Cozyville.

27:17.345 --> 27:18.638
Cozyville?

27:18.721 --> 27:20.389
Mm-hmm.

27:20.473 --> 27:22.099
Do you like it here?
It's very cozy.

27:22.183 --> 27:23.476
Let me see.

27:23.559 --> 27:25.227
Ah, yeah, I like Cozyville.

27:57.843 --> 28:00.179
What was that?

28:00.262 --> 28:01.972
Um...

28:03.391 --> 28:04.934
It's an emergency alert.

28:05.017 --> 28:06.310
"Due to blizzard conditions,

28:06.394 --> 28:10.106
all MTA bus and subway
service is suspended,

28:10.189 --> 28:13.317
and all non-emergency
vehicles must be off roads

28:13.401 --> 28:15.528
until further notice."

28:18.280 --> 28:20.408
How can I get home now?

28:22.535 --> 28:23.994
I don't know.

28:28.416 --> 28:31.043
It's too far just to walk.

28:33.546 --> 28:35.881
And with this weather...

28:39.802 --> 28:41.470
May I stay here?

28:42.430 --> 28:45.099
Yeah.

28:46.475 --> 28:52.398
Uh, okay, is this a shirt from
when you were really, really fat?

28:52.481 --> 28:54.233
No, that's Arnold's shirt.

28:55.443 --> 28:57.069
It makes sense. You're right.

28:57.153 --> 28:59.280
It's my new nightgown.

28:59.363 --> 29:00.656
It looks very nice.

29:00.740 --> 29:01.699
Thank you.

29:03.033 --> 29:06.162
So I need, um, a
pillow and a blanket.

29:06.245 --> 29:08.956
Nope. You take the bed.
I'll take the couch.

29:09.039 --> 29:11.000
Why? Come on, it's your place.

29:11.083 --> 29:13.377
You're my guest. Please.

29:13.461 --> 29:15.087
Take the bed.

29:15.171 --> 29:16.088
You sure?

29:16.172 --> 29:17.173
I'm sure.

29:17.256 --> 29:18.924
- Okay.
- All right.

29:30.561 --> 29:31.604
Good night!

29:31.687 --> 29:32.897
Buonanotte!

29:47.244 --> 29:49.330
I can't sleep!

29:49.413 --> 29:51.457
Yeah, I'm not that tired.
Are you?

29:51.540 --> 29:53.083
No.

29:55.252 --> 29:57.588
Should we have a
pajama dance party?

30:00.174 --> 30:02.218
- Do you know?
- Mm-mm.

30:02.301 --> 30:03.761
Do you know how to
dance the twist?

30:03.844 --> 30:05.054
I don't know.

30:05.137 --> 30:07.139
- No?
- I don't think so.

30:07.223 --> 30:09.433
Come on. Do you know this?

30:12.561 --> 30:14.522
Do this.

30:14.605 --> 30:16.106
You ready?

30:18.901 --> 30:20.569
Go down, go down, go down.

30:20.653 --> 30:22.571
No, not down here, down like...

30:22.655 --> 30:24.240
Oh, okay. Well, that's back.
That's not down.

30:24.323 --> 30:25.491
Oh, oh, you get it.

30:29.745 --> 30:31.956
Oh, you have to move
the back, like this.

30:32.039 --> 30:33.958
Yeah, twist your back.

30:34.041 --> 30:34.959
Am I doing it right?

30:35.042 --> 30:36.085
Kind of.

30:37.628 --> 30:40.506
You're so cute when
you dance the twist.

30:40.589 --> 30:42.758
I'm cute when I do everything.

30:42.842 --> 30:44.343
No.

30:44.426 --> 30:45.761
Go down.

30:45.845 --> 30:47.429
- Now you have to go down.
- Oh, now down?

30:47.513 --> 30:49.932
Oh, notice you said down again.
But you were wrong.

31:12.413 --> 31:14.373
Where you going? Come
over-- Come here.

31:15.291 --> 31:17.084
- You ready?
- Yeah.

31:21.380 --> 31:23.924
Now this way.

31:24.008 --> 31:26.427
Do this.

31:38.480 --> 31:41.525
Do you know that I've
been dating Pino

31:41.609 --> 31:45.529
since I was 18 years old?

31:45.613 --> 31:49.033
So, technically,
I've been dating him

31:49.116 --> 31:51.118
for all my adult life.

31:51.911 --> 31:54.830
I mean, he's the only guy

31:54.914 --> 31:56.290
I ever been with,

31:56.373 --> 32:00.294
like, properly been with.

32:00.377 --> 32:01.962
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

32:02.046 --> 32:04.089
The only "pino"
you've had is Pino's?

32:05.633 --> 32:07.885
Yes

32:07.968 --> 32:09.929
You guys never took
breaks or anything?

32:10.012 --> 32:12.181
Uh, We did.

32:12.264 --> 32:14.016
We did.

32:14.099 --> 32:17.227
But I haven't done anything.

32:17.311 --> 32:18.854
I'm sure he did.

32:18.938 --> 32:20.814
- Mm.
- But I don't want to know.

32:20.898 --> 32:23.943
You have never seen another
"pino" besides Pino's?

32:25.778 --> 32:26.654
No.

32:26.737 --> 32:27.696
Wow.

32:27.780 --> 32:30.240
Not even, like, by accident?

32:30.324 --> 32:33.369
Like, you're at the spa, and
you went into the wrong room

32:33.452 --> 32:36.038
and just walked in on a roomful
of "pinos" in a steam shower?

32:36.121 --> 32:38.248
What kind of spa you are in?

32:38.332 --> 32:39.833
What do you mean
"what kind of spa"?

32:39.917 --> 32:42.086
That's what it's like
in a spa for guys.

32:42.169 --> 32:43.879
You know, there's just
"pinos" everywhere.

32:43.963 --> 32:46.382
I'll change, and my "pino" will be out,
but I don't, like, leave it out there

32:46.465 --> 32:48.968
and, like, flaunt it around
everywhere in front of everybody.

32:49.051 --> 32:50.803
Some guys are just like,
"All right, I'm in a place

32:50.886 --> 32:53.514
where my 'pino' can be out, and it's
gonna be out there having a great time."

32:53.597 --> 32:55.766
They just don't care. It's
just out, like, in my face.

32:55.849 --> 32:57.476
I'm like, "All right, man.
Let's take it easy."

32:57.559 --> 32:58.978
Oh, okay.

32:59.103 --> 33:01.605
So maybe you have,
actually, a shy "pino."

33:01.689 --> 33:03.065
No, my "pino" is not shy.

33:03.148 --> 33:04.817
He's very gregarious.

33:04.900 --> 33:05.818
He plays tennis.

33:05.901 --> 33:07.528
He has a poker
game on Thursdays.

33:07.611 --> 33:09.530
- He's a good guy, but...
- Poker game?

33:09.613 --> 33:12.950
He just doesn't want to be out there in
the spa and around all these old guys.

33:13.033 --> 33:14.159
Okay.

33:14.243 --> 33:15.828
Old? Are they old?

33:15.911 --> 33:17.287
A lot of times.

33:19.456 --> 33:20.416
All right.

33:20.499 --> 33:22.501
Mm, but still...

33:23.627 --> 33:25.379
One sexual partner.

33:25.462 --> 33:27.131
And you guys are
gonna get married.

33:27.214 --> 33:29.508
That may be it, right?

33:29.591 --> 33:31.677
You ever been...

33:31.760 --> 33:34.805
curious what it's like to
just be with somebody else?

33:36.432 --> 33:37.933
Um...

33:39.393 --> 33:45.482
We actually did make one of those
celebrities list, you know?

33:45.566 --> 33:46.775
Mm.

33:46.859 --> 33:47.943
Who was on yours?

33:48.027 --> 33:50.112
Ryan Gosling.

33:50.195 --> 33:51.780
- Oh.
- I mean...

33:51.864 --> 33:53.949
- Sure.
- Absolutely.

33:54.033 --> 33:56.577
Uh, Robert Redford...

33:56.660 --> 33:58.704
when he was young.

33:58.787 --> 34:00.080
And...

34:00.164 --> 34:02.458
Marlon Brando.

34:02.541 --> 34:04.877
When he was alive, obviously.

34:04.960 --> 34:07.463
So two of yours, you'd have
to use a time machine.

34:07.546 --> 34:09.006
That's not an ideal list.

34:09.089 --> 34:11.216
No.

34:11.300 --> 34:13.052
Actually, it's not.

34:14.887 --> 34:16.430
What about you?

34:16.513 --> 34:17.765
Uh, I don't know.

34:17.848 --> 34:19.933
Come on, you never done it?

34:20.017 --> 34:21.310
I'll-- I'll make it now.

34:21.393 --> 34:22.978
- Okay.
- Let's see.

34:23.062 --> 34:25.147
Definitely that lady
from L'Avventura.

34:25.230 --> 34:26.482
Monica Vitti.

34:26.565 --> 34:27.608
Mm.

34:27.691 --> 34:29.068
Yeah, good choice.

34:29.151 --> 34:31.612
Um, I liked the lady in 8 1/2,

34:31.695 --> 34:32.613
Claudia...

34:32.696 --> 34:34.239
Claudia Cardinale.

34:34.323 --> 34:35.532
Mm-hmm.

34:36.742 --> 34:39.244
You like the Italians.

34:42.206 --> 34:44.583
I like some of them.

35:07.106 --> 35:08.774
Hey.

35:10.526 --> 35:12.611
Hey.

35:12.694 --> 35:14.530
You're sleeping on my ankles.

35:14.613 --> 35:15.614
Oh, I'm sorry.

35:15.697 --> 35:17.574
It's okay.

35:17.658 --> 35:20.077
I'll head over to the couch.

35:20.160 --> 35:23.080
You can sleep on the
pillow if you want.

35:23.163 --> 35:24.540
Mm, okay.

35:33.006 --> 35:35.259
Come on, it's cold outside.

35:35.342 --> 35:37.761
You can get under the blanket.

35:39.429 --> 35:40.556
Okay.

35:48.188 --> 35:50.107
Buonanotte.

35:50.190 --> 35:52.359
Buonanotte.

36:02.828 --> 36:04.997
Oh, my God,
she slept over?

36:05.080 --> 36:07.583
Yes! In my bed! With me!

36:07.666 --> 36:09.126
It was intense.

36:09.209 --> 36:10.419
Wow.

36:10.502 --> 36:11.920
Forbidden love.

36:12.004 --> 36:13.005
Arnie's jealous.

36:13.088 --> 36:14.590
I mean,
there was definitely moments

36:14.673 --> 36:16.717
where I was like, "What
is going on here?

36:16.800 --> 36:18.510
Do I just make a move?"

36:18.594 --> 36:20.846
Bro, come on,
what are you doing?

36:20.929 --> 36:22.806
She was in your bed with you.

36:22.890 --> 36:25.601
I know, but...
she's engaged.

36:25.684 --> 36:27.227
I'm sitting there,
looking at her,

36:27.311 --> 36:30.522
and then just staring at that
gigantic engagement ring.

36:30.606 --> 36:32.316
You're going on
all these fake dates.

36:32.399 --> 36:33.692
You're snuggling all over town.

36:33.775 --> 36:34.943
How is any of that different?

36:36.737 --> 36:38.363
You know what it is?

36:38.447 --> 36:40.073
This whole thing,

36:40.157 --> 36:41.700
it's horrible.

36:41.783 --> 36:43.243
It's causing me so much stress.

36:43.327 --> 36:44.494
I feel it in my chest.

36:44.578 --> 36:47.539
I can physically feel pain here.

36:47.623 --> 36:50.584
But at the same
time, it's amazing.

36:50.667 --> 36:52.878
It's like we're living
in this fantasy.

36:52.961 --> 36:56.673
And if I make a move and
it doesn't go well,

36:56.757 --> 36:58.217
the fantasy's over.

36:58.300 --> 37:00.219
Yeah, think about
it this way, though.

37:00.302 --> 37:02.471
She's leaving soon,
so it's over anyways.

37:02.554 --> 37:04.598
You might as well go for it.

37:04.681 --> 37:05.933
Yeah.

37:06.016 --> 37:08.352
Maybe it's time to
just go for it.

37:08.435 --> 37:11.188
You're bringing her to
my DJ night. That's perfect.

37:11.271 --> 37:13.941
Have a couple drinks,
do a little dancing.

37:14.024 --> 37:17.236
You know DJ Arnie's
supplying those sexy beats.

37:17.319 --> 37:20.280
Mm. That could be good.

37:20.364 --> 37:22.282
Or, I mean, maybe
it's better to just

37:22.366 --> 37:25.285
have a private conversation
in the apartment.

37:25.369 --> 37:26.662
I like that, too.

37:26.745 --> 37:28.413
But either way,

37:28.497 --> 37:30.499
you got to talk to
her from your heart.

37:32.793 --> 37:34.253
I just...

37:34.336 --> 37:36.797
I really don't know
how I'd say it.

37:38.674 --> 37:41.343
There's something going on.

37:41.426 --> 37:43.262
I can feel it inside.

37:43.345 --> 37:45.430
And I know you can, too.

37:45.514 --> 37:48.475
I know you're engaged,
and everything's complicated,

37:48.558 --> 37:50.310
but I had to say something,

37:50.352 --> 37:53.480
'cause if I didn't, I'd regret
it for the rest of my life.

37:53.563 --> 37:56.525
Bro, that was very powerful.

37:56.608 --> 38:00.279
If I'm Francesca, I'm
giving you kissies, 100%.

38:00.362 --> 38:01.613
Want to run it again?

38:01.697 --> 38:03.740
No, this is getting
a little weird.

38:03.824 --> 38:05.284
Want to switch roles?

38:05.367 --> 38:08.370
I mean, I'm not
sure why, but sure.

38:10.831 --> 38:15.002
Francesca, there's a chemical bond
between us that we cannot deny.

38:15.085 --> 38:17.254
I want to pick you up and
carry you away from Pino

38:17.337 --> 38:18.714
and toss you in the ocean

38:18.797 --> 38:20.590
and then give you kissies.

38:20.674 --> 38:23.010
Take my hand and
come to the ocean?

38:25.595 --> 38:28.015
Ah, I think I'm probably
gonna go with mine.

38:43.447 --> 38:45.073
What'd you like to drink?

38:45.157 --> 38:47.576
Urn, can I have just water?

38:48.660 --> 38:50.412
Yeah. Sure.

38:55.250 --> 38:56.835
Staying hydrated?

38:58.587 --> 39:01.214
I think I'm just gonna
take it easy tonight.

39:01.298 --> 39:02.507
All right.

39:30.911 --> 39:34.373
Uh, I'm gonna get another drink.
Do you want one?

39:34.456 --> 39:35.999
No.

39:36.083 --> 39:38.210
All right, um...

39:38.293 --> 39:39.753
I'll wait for you here.

39:39.836 --> 39:41.296
Okay.

39:58.814 --> 40:01.608
You seem tired. You want to--
You want to grab a Red Bull?

40:01.691 --> 40:03.527
- It'll wake you u--
- No, I'm okay.

40:03.610 --> 40:04.820
I am fine.

40:04.903 --> 40:06.738
You normally like
to dance and stuff.

40:06.822 --> 40:09.825
I'm fine. Just stop
taking care of me, okay?

40:09.908 --> 40:11.326
I'm fine.

40:12.786 --> 40:13.703
All right, I'm sorry.

40:20.335 --> 40:22.045
Dude, we got to talk.

40:22.129 --> 40:23.755
Wait. Hold on one second.

40:23.839 --> 40:26.049
Make some noise for DJ Arnie!

40:26.133 --> 40:28.135
- Did you have to do that then?
- Yeah, I kind of had to.

40:28.218 --> 40:30.220
Oh, dude, give me the
Captain's update.

40:30.303 --> 40:32.013
Captain's update is the
ship's fucking sinking.

40:32.097 --> 40:32.931
What?

40:33.014 --> 40:34.850
She's gone cold.
Everything's changed.

40:34.933 --> 40:36.726
I don't know. I think she got
freaked out or something.

40:36.810 --> 40:38.520
Did we not
rehearse enough last night?

40:38.603 --> 40:40.564
- Shit. Talk about something else.
- Um...

40:40.647 --> 40:44.901
So I was like, "Hey, man, this is
not the iguana that you listed.

40:44.985 --> 40:46.278
This is obviously a
different lizard."

40:47.863 --> 40:49.197
Hey, guys.

40:49.281 --> 40:50.782
Uh, I'm a bit tired.

40:50.866 --> 40:52.451
I think I'm gonna go back home.

40:52.534 --> 40:53.660
Okay?

40:53.743 --> 40:55.579
Sure. All right.

40:55.662 --> 40:56.872
Dev!

40:57.789 --> 40:59.791
Hey, Kristy, what's up?

40:59.875 --> 41:01.376
Not too much. What
are you doing here?

41:01.460 --> 41:02.627
Uh, my buddy Arnold is DJ'ing.

41:02.711 --> 41:04.504
Arnold, this is Kristy.
Kristy, Arnold.

41:04.588 --> 41:06.131
DiGiorno.

41:06.214 --> 41:07.883
I got to run, but you should
meet up with me later.

41:07.966 --> 41:09.926
My friend's having a party
at her yoga studio.

41:10.010 --> 41:11.511
It's their one-year anniversary.

41:11.595 --> 41:12.846
Oh, cool.

41:12.929 --> 41:14.473
Oh, my God, yoga party?

41:14.556 --> 41:16.558
That sounds hot! You mind
if Arnold tags along?

41:16.641 --> 41:17.851
You're DJ'ing.

41:17.934 --> 41:19.269
None of this is functional.

41:19.352 --> 41:21.354
I had a DJ'ing cooking
the whole time.

41:22.314 --> 41:24.691
- Text me later, okay?
- All right, bye.

41:28.403 --> 41:31.364
Uh, all right, well, um, I
guess I'll see you later.

41:31.448 --> 41:34.159
I'm probably gonna hang out with Arnold,
then maybe go to this yoga thing.

41:35.410 --> 41:36.786
Sure.

41:36.870 --> 41:38.038
Good night.

41:38.121 --> 41:39.206
Bye.

41:53.553 --> 41:56.139
Hey. I thought you were leaving.

41:56.223 --> 41:57.724
Yes, I was about to leave,

41:57.807 --> 42:00.727
but my driver went to the
wrong address, so...

42:00.769 --> 42:02.562
Mm.

42:06.024 --> 42:07.150
What?

42:07.734 --> 42:08.944
What's wrong with you?

42:09.694 --> 42:11.530
I'm just... tired.

42:12.322 --> 42:14.741
So you're tired? That--
That's what it is?

42:14.824 --> 42:17.369
Yes, I'm really tired.

42:21.456 --> 42:23.500
Well, uh, have fun with Kristy.

42:23.583 --> 42:25.043
Why are you saying it like that?

42:25.794 --> 42:27.379
I don't know.

42:27.462 --> 42:31.007
I didn't think that you would
like some girl like her. I mean--

42:31.091 --> 42:33.218
- Really?
- Yeah.

42:33.301 --> 42:35.428
Well, what kind of girl do
you think I should be with?

42:37.973 --> 42:41.393
Well, someone more charming,

42:41.476 --> 42:42.644
funny,

42:42.727 --> 42:44.020
less taller.

42:44.104 --> 42:46.106
- Less taller?
- Yeah.

42:46.189 --> 42:48.066
Isn't there a word for that?

42:49.317 --> 42:51.152
Smaller.

42:51.236 --> 42:53.029
Bravo.

42:53.113 --> 42:54.698
Yeah.

42:56.783 --> 42:58.493
So...

42:58.577 --> 43:00.203
someone smaller...

43:00.287 --> 43:01.538
Mm-hmm.

43:01.621 --> 43:03.540
...more charming and funny.

43:05.083 --> 43:06.626
Sound pretty great.

43:06.710 --> 43:08.086
It is.

43:15.051 --> 43:17.512
What if I told you I met
someone like that...

43:18.888 --> 43:20.390
but they're engaged?

43:25.770 --> 43:27.814
Well, I would say,

43:27.897 --> 43:30.317
it's a tricky situation...

43:31.610 --> 43:33.903
but for both of them.

43:42.203 --> 43:44.080
I have to go.

44:17.656 --> 44:18.573
Hey.

44:18.657 --> 44:20.325
Hey.

44:20.408 --> 44:23.536
Um, I'm sorry about tonight.

44:23.620 --> 44:25.288
I need to talk to you.

44:25.372 --> 44:26.998
Can I meet you at
your apartment?

44:27.082 --> 44:29.918
Yeah. I-I-I can be there
in, like, 20 minutes.

44:30.001 --> 44:30.919
Okay. Thanks.

44:31.002 --> 44:32.253
All right. Bye.

44:32.337 --> 44:33.672
Bye.

44:35.965 --> 44:37.926
I'm sorry.

44:38.009 --> 44:40.637
I've been acting really weird.
I'm so sorry.

44:42.180 --> 44:43.765
I'm just confused, you know?

44:43.848 --> 44:46.017
I'm leaving soon, and...

44:46.101 --> 44:47.977
and I can't believe it.

44:50.814 --> 44:52.440
I'm really gonna miss you.

44:52.524 --> 44:54.818
I'm really gonna miss you, too.

44:54.901 --> 44:57.320
No, Dev, I'm...

44:57.404 --> 44:59.614
really gonna miss you.

45:00.865 --> 45:03.743
I feel sad because I
don't want to leave you.

45:04.494 --> 45:06.788
I don't want you to leave.

45:12.043 --> 45:13.420
What are you doing?

45:15.880 --> 45:18.133
Are you trying to kiss me?

45:19.467 --> 45:21.511
I thought you wanted me to. I--

45:22.220 --> 45:23.555
Why?

45:24.431 --> 45:26.474
I thought there was something
going on between us.

45:26.558 --> 45:28.727
Do you have feelings for me?

45:30.729 --> 45:33.815
Oh, my God, you do
have feelings for me.

45:33.898 --> 45:35.650
Oh, no!

45:35.734 --> 45:36.651
No!

45:55.003 --> 45:56.087
Oops.

46:00.467 --> 46:03.136
I thought she actually
had feelings for you.

46:04.554 --> 46:06.055
Sorry it didn't work out.

46:13.354 --> 46:16.065
Wow. Oh, wow.

46:24.824 --> 46:26.576
Really? Yes,
yes, yes, sir.

46:26.659 --> 46:28.620
Of course. Of sour--
Yeah, yeah, no problem.

46:28.703 --> 46:29.621
No problem. I can come.

46:29.704 --> 46:31.414
Okay, fantastic. We'll
see you on Saturday.

46:31.498 --> 46:34.834
Great.Ciao. Ciao. Grazie.
Ciao, ciao.

51:49.982 --> 51:52.610
Wow, this is so cool.

51:52.693 --> 51:54.362
Look at this.

51:54.445 --> 51:56.030
Yeah, it's nice.

51:56.114 --> 51:58.116
Nice? I mean, it's amazing.

51:58.199 --> 52:00.201
Come on, what's
going on with you?

52:02.995 --> 52:05.623
Dev, what's wrong with you?

52:10.670 --> 52:12.630
What's wrong is...

52:16.551 --> 52:20.138
I'm in love with you,
and you're engaged.

52:30.565 --> 52:32.358
I wasn't expecting
you to say that.

52:32.441 --> 52:36.028
Francesca, come on, there's obviously
something going on between us, right?

52:37.905 --> 52:38.948
Hey.

52:39.031 --> 52:40.449
What do you want me to say?

52:40.533 --> 52:42.451
I want you to say...

52:42.535 --> 52:44.537
that you feel the same
way I feel inside

52:44.620 --> 52:46.122
and that I'm not crazy.

52:47.623 --> 52:48.541
DO you?

52:48.624 --> 52:50.001
Yes! I do!

52:50.084 --> 52:51.127
Okay?

52:51.210 --> 52:52.503
I do feel something for you.

52:52.587 --> 52:54.714
I do like you. I
probably love you.

52:54.797 --> 52:56.424
I think of you. I dream of you.

52:56.507 --> 52:58.342
When I'm with Pino, I
wish he could be you.

52:58.426 --> 53:00.011
But it's not. It's Pino,
and I'm with him.

53:00.094 --> 53:02.889
And I'm engaged, and there's
nothing I can do about it.

53:02.972 --> 53:05.099
Of course there is.

53:05.183 --> 53:07.602
We can figure this out.

53:07.685 --> 53:09.103
We can.

53:10.813 --> 53:12.982
Francesca, it's your life.

53:13.065 --> 53:16.194
You really want to be with Pino? Is
that what you want in your heart?

53:16.277 --> 53:18.321
You can't be lukewarm.

53:20.281 --> 53:21.616
What's "lukewarm"?

53:23.618 --> 53:26.120
It means not hot, not cold.
It's in the middle.

53:28.497 --> 53:30.208
I don't want to be lukewarm.

53:30.291 --> 53:31.626
No.

53:31.709 --> 53:33.211
See? I just want to
do this with you.

53:33.294 --> 53:36.047
I want to laugh with you. I want
to define random English words.

53:36.130 --> 53:38.174
I-I just want to be with you.

53:38.257 --> 53:42.511
You make me so happy, and I think
I make you pretty happy, too.

53:44.055 --> 53:46.807
These past few weeks
have been so amazing.

53:46.891 --> 53:49.894
And there's so many times I just
wanted to grab you and kiss you.

53:49.977 --> 53:51.646
You don't even know.

53:53.147 --> 53:56.150
Well, probably I would
have kissed you back.

54:03.991 --> 54:07.078
Hey, guys, just so you know, I
can hear everything you're saying,

54:07.161 --> 54:09.580
and it sounds like you're having
a fairly intimate conversation.

54:09.664 --> 54:12.959
Just let me know if you'd like to
switch over to a private channel.

54:52.206 --> 54:56.168
Can we go somewhere and talk?

54:56.252 --> 54:59.297
Dev, I need you to
give me time, okay?

54:59.380 --> 55:00.756
Just give me some time.

55:00.840 --> 55:03.884
We will talk, I promise,
but give me time now.

55:03.968 --> 55:05.052
Okay.

55:06.387 --> 55:08.306
Ciao.
