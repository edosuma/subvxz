23:51.197 --> 23:52.997
Bullshit.

23:52.999 --> 23:54.799
[foley] <i>so the southern</i>
<i>poverty law center</i>

23:54.801 --> 23:58.068
<i>Has just labeled us</i>
<i>an extremist hate group.</i>

23:58.070 --> 24:01.038
<i>But we're just regular</i>
<i>people who're standing up</i>

24:01.040 --> 24:04.241
<i>And saying, "enough's enough,</i>
<i>we're sick and fricking tired."</i>

24:04.243 --> 24:06.110
<i>Something needs</i>
<i>to be done.</i>

24:09.482 --> 24:12.917
<i>I believe that everybody</i>
<i>has a purpose,</i>

24:12.919 --> 24:16.687
<i>All roads lead to one spot</i>
<i>and this is where I am now.</i>

24:19.592 --> 24:21.959
<i>I left home</i>
<i>when I was 15,</i>

24:21.961 --> 24:24.695
<i>I was tired</i>
<i>of the physical and mental,</i>

24:24.697 --> 24:29.200
Emotional, whatever you want
to call the abuse by my father.

24:29.202 --> 24:32.570
<i>So I tried to drown out the feelings and everything out</i>

24:32.572 --> 24:34.939
<i>With alcohol and drugs.</i>

24:36.309 --> 24:38.676
<i>I tried meth</i>
<i>for a year or so,</i>

24:38.678 --> 24:41.345
<i>Couldn't even</i>
<i>control myself.</i>

24:41.347 --> 24:43.581
<i>And one day</i>
<i>I stopped at a bar</i>

24:43.583 --> 24:45.349
And had
a few too many.

24:45.351 --> 24:50.020
And I was passing this semi,
and somebody was coming head on.

24:50.022 --> 24:52.356
And I got in front of the semi
and started sliding sideways,

24:52.358 --> 24:56.527
And I remember looking up at him and
he just threw his hands up and said,

24:56.529 --> 24:58.395
"can't do anything, sorry."

25:00.566 --> 25:04.368
<i>The truck rolled six times</i>
<i>and I climbed out</i>

25:04.370 --> 25:09.773
<i>Looked down and there was my wallet</i>
<i>and the pictures of my two kids,</i>

25:09.775 --> 25:12.576
<i>And so I said,</i>
<i>"okay, I got it."</i>

25:12.578 --> 25:16.647
So 18 years ago
I quit everything.

25:16.649 --> 25:23.821
Realized that I needed
to deal with, uh, my issues.

25:25.090 --> 25:28.092
And so, I dealt with them.

25:35.034 --> 25:39.136
<i>Once I got cleaned up</i>
<i>I was working construction,</i>

25:39.138 --> 25:43.307
<i>But back in late '08 when the</i>
<i>economy started falling apart</i>

25:43.309 --> 25:44.909
<i>I lost my job overnight,</i>

25:44.911 --> 25:48.846
<i>I lost my house,</i>
<i>I had to sell everything.</i>

25:50.850 --> 25:53.384
<i>I hit the road for a year,</i>
<i>year and a half,</i>

25:53.386 --> 25:59.023
<i>But everywhere I went there was illegals</i>
<i>working on every construction job.</i>

25:59.025 --> 26:01.125
A lot of them are doing
work under the table,

26:01.127 --> 26:04.828
They're not paying taxes,
they're sucking into the system.

26:05.864 --> 26:07.565
<i>So I said,</i>
<i>"well I got to</i>

26:07.567 --> 26:09.033
Try to help and do
something about this."

26:09.035 --> 26:13.704
So that's how arizona border recon came in existence.

26:18.110 --> 26:21.645
<i>I took the last of my savings,</i>
<i>came down to the border.</i>

26:21.647 --> 26:25.716
<i>Lived in my truck for the first</i>
<i>two months in the mountains.</i>

26:25.718 --> 26:28.852
<i>I would drive the roads,</i>
<i>find the trails,</i>

26:28.854 --> 26:32.289
<i>And apprehend illegals</i>
<i>coming out of that area.</i>

26:32.291 --> 26:34.992
[speaking spanish]

26:40.933 --> 26:45.169
[foley] <i>but once I learned how the
cartels pretty much controlled,</i>

26:45.171 --> 26:48.472
<i>Both the human smuggling</i>
<i>and the drug smuggling.</i>

26:48.474 --> 26:50.674
<i>We had shifted</i>

27:37.623 --> 27:43.027
There's more people joining survivalist groups, militias,
now than ever before

27:43.029 --> 27:45.729
Because they're scared
that the country's collapsing,

27:45.731 --> 27:48.666

<i>They're tired of sitting,</i>
<i>they're tired of waiting.</i>

01:33:43.619 --> 01:33:46.252
<i>They're tired of nobody</i>
<i>doing anything,</i>

01:33:46.254 --> 01:33:49.422
<i>So they take the law</i>
<i>into their own hands.</i>

01:33:54.730 --> 01:33:56.563
<i>The cycles do stop,</i>

01:33:56.565 --> 01:33:58.531
<i>You just got to want</i>
<i>to change them.</i>

01:33:58.533 --> 01:34:01.301
[whistles] let's go, rocko.

01:34:03.605 --> 01:34:09.042
[foley] <i>I left home because of the
physical and mental abuse by my father</i>

01:34:11.013 --> 01:34:14.948
<i>But at one point he finally</i>
<i>got to meet my daughters.</i>

01:34:14.950 --> 01:34:16.416
<i>And he complimented</i>
<i>me, and says,</i>

01:34:16.418 --> 01:34:18.952
<i>"hey, they're great kids</i>
<i>they're well behaved,</i>

01:34:18.954 --> 01:34:22.956
They're articulate, they're intelligent,
and everything else.

01:34:22.958 --> 01:34:26.226
And I told him
I had him to thank,

01:34:26.228 --> 01:34:31.464
<i>Because everything</i>
<i>that he did to me,</i>

01:34:31.466 --> 01:34:33.700
<i>I did the exact opposite.</i>

01:34:34.468 --> 01:34:37.504
So the cycles can change,

01:34:37.506 --> 01:34:39.806
It just takes somebody
to change them.

01:34:39.808 --> 01:34:45.879
<i>But we're stuck in a cycle</i>
<i>where nobody wants to change.</i>

01:34:45.881 --> 01:34:47.514
<i>When they're spouting,</i>
<i>they're changing</i>

01:34:47.516 --> 01:34:49.282
<i>But they're not</i>
<i>doing anything.</i>

01:34:50.652 --> 01:34:53.920
They're doing the same thing,
but just with a different look.

01:35:23.752 --> 01:35:25.251
[man speaking english]

01:37:01.249 --> 01:37:04.050
[loud clock ticking]

01:37:05.305 --> 01:37:11.180
