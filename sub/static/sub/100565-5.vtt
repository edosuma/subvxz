WEBVTT

00:01.069 --> 00:02.703
How long are we
supposed to wait?

00:04.505 --> 00:06.574
To feel comfortable
with women having power?

00:08.842 --> 00:11.279
How much time do we give people
to adapt to change?

03:42.890 --> 03:46.026
So, Jamie.
Tell me...

03:46.059 --> 03:48.896
What exactly is the story
between you and Lily?

03:50.298 --> 03:52.900
Actually, don't tell me.
I'm gonna guess.

03:54.268 --> 03:56.937
You're a puppy dog.

03:56.970 --> 03:58.972
And you're devoted to her,
forever and ever.

03:59.006 --> 04:00.474
And you'll do
anything she wants,

04:00.508 --> 04:02.276
in case she chucks you a bone.

04:05.846 --> 04:08.081
I hit the bull's-eye, didn't I?

04:56.196 --> 04:58.332
Okay.

04:58.366 --> 04:59.967
You're good.
Let's talk.

05:03.236 --> 05:06.306
So, uh, in case you don't know,

05:06.340 --> 05:08.676
my name is Kenton.

05:08.709 --> 05:11.211
I'm the head of security
at Amaya.

05:12.546 --> 05:14.047
And I've got a problem.

05:15.349 --> 05:18.552
My problem is
I have to contain

05:18.586 --> 05:20.954
a very complex situation,

05:20.988 --> 05:24.825
but the situation
is refusing to be contained.

05:24.858 --> 05:27.695
In fact...

05:27.728 --> 05:29.162
...it's cascading.

05:30.531 --> 05:34.067
Once a cascade starts,
the impulse is to panic.

05:34.101 --> 05:36.303
You feel like you're standing
in front of an avalanche

05:36.336 --> 05:38.772
with a fucking bucket and spade.

05:40.608 --> 05:43.010
But I'm not panicking.

05:44.211 --> 05:46.079
I'll tell you why.

05:46.113 --> 05:47.615
Long ago...

05:50.518 --> 05:52.820
...when I was about your age,

05:52.853 --> 05:55.523
maybe a little older,

05:55.556 --> 05:57.357
I was in the CIA.

05:57.391 --> 06:00.093
I was based in Hong Kong.

06:00.127 --> 06:03.196
And we were working
toward what we called

06:03.230 --> 06:05.433
the American century.

06:05.466 --> 06:08.368
The 20th century
was all about war in Europe

06:08.402 --> 06:11.271
and communism in Russia
and Asia,

06:11.304 --> 06:14.041
but the 21st century
was gonna be

06:14.074 --> 06:17.611
all for the stars and stripes.

06:17.645 --> 06:20.414
Things seemed to be
going pretty well.

06:20.448 --> 06:22.450
The Soviet Union had collapsed,

06:22.483 --> 06:25.919
Europe was nicely
weak and stable.

06:25.953 --> 06:27.755
And on my beat,

06:27.788 --> 06:31.725
a popular uprising
had started on mainland China.

06:31.759 --> 06:33.927
The focus point was Beijing.

06:33.961 --> 06:36.029
Hundreds of thousands
of demonstrators

06:36.063 --> 06:38.766
had occupied Tiananmen Square.

06:38.799 --> 06:40.734
Wouldn't fucking budge.

06:40.768 --> 06:42.936
And at a certain point,

06:42.970 --> 06:46.440
my bureau chief called us
into his office and said...

06:46.474 --> 06:48.809
China was finished.

06:48.842 --> 06:51.378
Whatever the government did
wouldn't make a difference.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.814
The protests would spread
across the country,

06:53.847 --> 06:55.849
the system would collapse.

06:57.317 --> 06:59.286
The tipping point was reached.

06:59.319 --> 07:02.422
The cascade was unstoppable.

07:02.456 --> 07:04.458
You know what happened next?

07:06.960 --> 07:08.596
The Chinese government

07:08.629 --> 07:12.265
sent in soldiers and tanks
to Tiananmen Square,

07:12.299 --> 07:14.668
shot everybody they could.

07:14.702 --> 07:18.171
Took the revolution by the neck

07:18.205 --> 07:20.207
and crushed the fucking life
out of it.

07:24.011 --> 07:27.114
Today, China is the most
powerful force on the planet,

07:27.147 --> 07:30.484
the most powerful force
the world has ever known.

07:32.152 --> 07:34.622
And it turned out to be

07:34.655 --> 07:36.657
the Chinese century.

07:41.895 --> 07:43.864
Story over.

07:43.897 --> 07:45.398
My point?

07:47.367 --> 07:49.537
Everything's containable.

07:49.570 --> 07:51.839
But only if you're willing
to do what it takes.

07:53.507 --> 07:55.509
I'm willing to do what it takes.

07:57.010 --> 07:58.478
Do you believe me?

08:00.548 --> 08:02.516
You are a dissident,

08:02.550 --> 08:03.951
I am a tank.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.485
Do you believe me?

08:06.754 --> 08:09.557
Y-Y... Y-Yes.

08:11.525 --> 08:14.161
I think you believe me.

08:14.194 --> 08:15.929
But I need to be sure.

08:27.875 --> 08:29.843
Shut up.
Shut up.

08:29.877 --> 08:32.279
-Shut up.

08:35.616 --> 08:37.651
Whatever you and Lily
were doing,

08:37.685 --> 08:40.353
whoever you were talking to,

08:40.387 --> 08:44.191
whatever you're planning,
it stops right now.

08:44.224 --> 08:47.695
Unless you do
exactly as I say...

08:47.728 --> 08:49.730
no one you care about is safe.

08:51.632 --> 08:53.133
Are we clear?

08:55.268 --> 08:57.771
Y-Y... Yes.

09:00.440 --> 09:01.942
Good.

11:30.623 --> 11:32.059
Oh, Jesus.

11:38.565 --> 11:40.033
...wanted me to do.

11:40.067 --> 11:42.102
So I told him...
Well, I told him everything.

11:42.135 --> 11:44.271
I told him,
"This is what we're gonna do..."

11:55.415 --> 11:57.417
Hey.
Are you okay?

11:59.887 --> 12:02.522
Sorry. Yeah.
I'm fine.

12:06.626 --> 12:08.261
If you want to be left alone,
that's okay.

12:08.295 --> 12:09.562
I can leave you alone.

12:09.596 --> 12:12.299
It's nothing serious.
No one died.

12:15.102 --> 12:16.236
You just broke up.

12:21.942 --> 12:25.779
Well... that counts as serious.

12:27.514 --> 12:29.482
I guess.

12:30.918 --> 12:34.788
So... yeah, I feel like shit.

12:37.624 --> 12:40.627
Presumably you broke up
for a reason.

12:42.662 --> 12:44.164
Mm-hmm.

12:46.199 --> 12:47.968
Because he's not the right guy.

12:49.803 --> 12:51.304
Yeah.

12:53.006 --> 12:56.676
So... it is what it is.

12:58.711 --> 12:59.847
That was blunt.

13:04.017 --> 13:07.320
You're absolutely right.
I-I'm sorry.

13:09.789 --> 13:12.625
You know what, I-I was
talking to myself, not you.

13:13.660 --> 13:14.828
What do you mean?

13:17.330 --> 13:19.366
I'm in the same boat.

13:19.399 --> 13:22.202
Except a few months further
down the line.

13:22.235 --> 13:24.671
And I've become seriously expert

13:24.704 --> 13:26.473
at beating myself up.

13:26.506 --> 13:29.476
So I say shit like
"it is what it is"

13:29.509 --> 13:32.579
because it makes me
feel like I am assertive...

13:33.981 --> 13:35.715
...instead of a punching bag.

13:39.319 --> 13:40.921
In other words, ignore me.

13:44.324 --> 13:46.326
Actually...

13:46.359 --> 13:48.361
to be honest, you're right.

13:48.395 --> 13:49.863
It is what it is.

13:49.897 --> 13:51.498
Don't worry.

13:52.699 --> 13:54.401
Break-ups aren't all bad.

13:54.434 --> 13:56.536
It means you have the endless
pleasure of dating ahead of you.

13:56.569 --> 13:58.638
Christ.

13:58.671 --> 14:00.640
What a thought.

14:00.673 --> 14:03.343
Seriously, however bad
you remember it,

14:03.376 --> 14:05.512
it's so much worse.

14:05.545 --> 14:07.915
I mean, the app thing
is out of control.

14:07.948 --> 14:10.317
But there's no choice
if you want to meet someone.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.319
And I don't mean
meet someone special,

14:12.352 --> 14:15.422
I mean, literally, meet anyone.

14:20.093 --> 14:23.330
Well, I think I've done enough
cheering you up.

14:23.363 --> 14:26.499
Yeah.
Great job.

14:26.533 --> 14:29.169
I'll see you around. On Tinder.

14:29.202 --> 14:30.904
No.

14:32.940 --> 14:34.541
No, me neither.

14:35.976 --> 14:37.710
I'll see you around here.

14:39.079 --> 14:40.780
Sure.

15:43.943 --> 15:46.346
Look down there.

15:46.379 --> 15:47.847
Would you really feel any pity

15:47.880 --> 15:51.184
if one of those dots
stopped moving forever?

15:51.218 --> 15:54.187
If I offered you Â£20,000
for every dot that stopped,

15:54.221 --> 15:57.190
would you really, old man,
tell me to keep my money?

15:57.224 --> 15:59.959
Or would you...
calculate how many dots

15:59.993 --> 16:01.794
you could afford to spend?

16:01.828 --> 16:04.964
Free of income tax, old man.
Free of income tax.

16:04.998 --> 16:06.233
The only way...

16:07.500 --> 16:09.502
Lily.

16:14.007 --> 16:15.508
I'm in love with you.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.715
Whoa.

16:22.749 --> 16:25.985
It's the first time
either of us have said that.

16:26.019 --> 16:28.021
You are creative.

16:29.056 --> 16:30.723
You are unexpected.

16:30.757 --> 16:32.792
Funny.

16:32.825 --> 16:34.694
Clever.

16:34.727 --> 16:36.196
Hot.

16:36.229 --> 16:38.231
Awesome in every way.

16:39.499 --> 16:42.169
So, yeah-- I'm in love with you.

16:44.937 --> 16:46.939
I'm in love with you too.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.409
Really?

16:50.710 --> 16:52.379
Mm-hmm.

16:56.283 --> 16:57.750
Cool.

17:01.754 --> 17:04.357
...you can save money nowadays.

17:04.391 --> 17:06.025
Lot of good your money'll
do you in jail.

17:06.059 --> 17:08.428
That jail is in another zone.

17:08.461 --> 17:10.863
There's no proof against me.

17:10.897 --> 17:12.532
Besides you.

17:12.565 --> 17:15.568
I should be pretty easy
to get rid of.

17:17.237 --> 17:19.439
Pretty easy.

17:37.557 --> 17:40.427
Gun. Barrier. Sensor.

17:42.462 --> 17:44.531
The dual-slit experiment.

17:44.564 --> 17:46.933
I'm sure you are all familiar.

17:46.966 --> 17:49.736
A stream
of single quantum particles--

17:49.769 --> 17:51.238
let's say photons--

17:51.271 --> 17:53.740
are fired at two slits
in a barrier.

17:53.773 --> 17:56.643
Mysteriously, the single photon

17:56.676 --> 17:58.077
appears to pass through

17:58.111 --> 18:01.080
both slits at the same time,

18:01.114 --> 18:03.316
as evidenced
by the interference pattern

18:03.350 --> 18:04.984
that starts to appear

18:05.017 --> 18:07.454
when the photon
hits the back sensor.

18:07.487 --> 18:10.390
We conclude
that the single photon

18:10.423 --> 18:13.760
is somehow
interacting with itself.

18:13.793 --> 18:15.762
And now we have
prima facie evidence

18:15.795 --> 18:18.431
of the superposition
of quantum particles.

18:18.465 --> 18:21.401
That they can exist
in more than one place

18:21.434 --> 18:23.636
at the same time.

18:25.638 --> 18:28.741
That idea...

18:28.775 --> 18:31.978
makes us uncomfortable.

18:32.011 --> 18:33.680
We're not used to things

18:33.713 --> 18:36.683
being in more than one place
at the same time.

18:36.716 --> 18:40.587
It's in conflict with our direct
experience of the world.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.922
I am not in a superposition,

18:42.955 --> 18:46.526
I am standing only here.
And you

18:46.559 --> 18:47.827
are not in a superposition,

18:47.860 --> 18:50.697
you are sitting only there.

18:50.730 --> 18:52.432
So we decide
we need more information.

18:52.465 --> 18:55.302
We place a detector
on one of the two slits,

18:55.335 --> 18:58.605
so we can tell when the photon
is passing through.

18:58.638 --> 19:01.941
But as soon
as the detector is activated,

19:01.974 --> 19:03.443
the interference pattern

19:03.476 --> 19:06.446
on the back sensor disappears.

19:06.479 --> 19:09.849
The superposition photon
has suddenly collapsed

19:09.882 --> 19:12.385
to a classical single position.

19:12.419 --> 19:14.120
The photon is now

19:14.153 --> 19:16.856
only in one place.

19:16.889 --> 19:20.327
The act of our
observing the particle

19:20.360 --> 19:23.563
has somehow changed it.

19:23.596 --> 19:25.365
It's a complex problem,

19:25.398 --> 19:27.867
which leads
to a simple question.

19:27.900 --> 19:30.370
-What the hell just happened?
-Now watch--

19:30.403 --> 19:32.739
I asked the professor
to provoke her.

19:32.772 --> 19:35.208
There's no shortage
of proposed answers

19:35.242 --> 19:37.677
to that question.
The Copenhagen interpretation,

19:37.710 --> 19:40.146
which states
that the act of measurement

19:40.179 --> 19:43.015
-affects the system.
-Please.

19:43.049 --> 19:45.818
The Penrose interpretation,
which suggests

19:45.852 --> 19:47.987
that the wave function collapse

19:48.020 --> 19:51.224
is caused
by space-time curvature.

19:52.292 --> 19:53.760
But I want to talk to you

19:53.793 --> 19:57.397
about the von Neumann-Wigner
interpretation,

19:57.430 --> 20:00.333
which states
that human consciousness

20:00.367 --> 20:03.670
is the key modifier
in decoherence.

20:03.703 --> 20:05.037
Are you fucking kidding?

20:06.406 --> 20:07.507
Katie.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.509
You're offering a lecture

20:09.542 --> 20:11.444
on von Neumann-Wigner?

20:11.478 --> 20:13.780
Uh... Are you serious?
The...

20:13.813 --> 20:15.382
Half the people in this room
are undergrads.

20:15.415 --> 20:17.016
They might actually
believe what you're saying.

20:17.049 --> 20:19.619
There are many
interesting conjectures

20:19.652 --> 20:21.120
within the theory.

20:21.153 --> 20:22.755
It's dualist bullshit.

20:22.789 --> 20:24.391
Which is the worst kind
of bullshit.

20:24.424 --> 20:27.294
-You would prefer...
-The Everett interpretation.

20:27.327 --> 20:30.297
-Which you didn't even mention.
-Ah. Everett.

20:30.330 --> 20:32.432
Whose interpretation states

20:32.465 --> 20:34.867
that there is no change
to the superposition

20:34.901 --> 20:37.870
of the humble quantum particle.

20:37.904 --> 20:41.474
Rather, there is a change
to the entire universe.

20:41.508 --> 20:45.312
It states that the macroscopic
superposition exists.

20:45.345 --> 20:47.280
And just so we're all clear
what that means--

20:47.314 --> 20:50.283
it means the universe
is constantly splitting,

20:50.317 --> 20:53.486
like the trunk
and branches and twigs

20:53.520 --> 20:55.988
of an infinitely large tree.

20:56.022 --> 20:57.390
And on that tree,

20:57.424 --> 21:01.093
all possible worlds will exist.

21:01.127 --> 21:04.230
All possible events will happen.

21:04.263 --> 21:06.265
All histories and all futures,

21:06.299 --> 21:09.235
a near infinite number of times.

21:09.268 --> 21:11.070
It's deterministic.

21:11.103 --> 21:12.405
It's supported by the math

21:12.439 --> 21:14.307
and it's supported
by the experiment.

21:15.542 --> 21:18.010
But it's not supported
by the real world.

21:21.981 --> 21:23.683
Whatever.

21:23.716 --> 21:26.152
Enjoy, dweebs.

21:26.185 --> 21:28.888
-Bye.

21:33.125 --> 21:36.996
Von Neumann-Wigner.
What a fucking joke.

22:03.055 --> 22:05.057
Katie... Katie...

22:05.091 --> 22:06.859
Katie... Katie... Katie...

22:06.893 --> 22:08.395
Katie?

22:13.500 --> 22:15.001
Yes?

22:18.738 --> 22:21.040
Uh, one of your professors
is a friend of mine.

22:23.610 --> 22:26.078
She told me you're the best
student she's had in years,

22:26.112 --> 22:28.080
perhaps ever.

22:28.114 --> 22:30.349
That's nice.

22:31.384 --> 22:33.052
She also told me...

22:33.085 --> 22:36.856
your family can no longer
cover your college fees.

22:39.225 --> 22:41.428
I want to pay
for your college fees...

22:43.430 --> 22:46.098
...and offer you a job
when you graduate.

22:48.535 --> 22:49.869
Who are you?

22:57.243 --> 22:59.245
Do you understand
what I'm asking?

23:02.381 --> 23:03.883
Yes.

23:05.985 --> 23:07.487
I do.

23:08.555 --> 23:10.557
Is it madness?

23:12.992 --> 23:14.994
Is there a world
in which it could work?

25:34.266 --> 25:36.235
Whoa.

25:36.268 --> 25:38.871
This is way better
than last time.

25:38.905 --> 25:41.908
My sugar cube doesn't have
a single error package.

25:43.375 --> 25:45.377
I got a few here in the shell.

25:49.415 --> 25:50.783
Are those errors?

25:52.384 --> 25:54.621
I think those are actual gaps
in the structure.

25:55.655 --> 25:57.123
Oh.

25:57.156 --> 25:58.991
Yeah, you might be right.

26:09.669 --> 26:11.170
Skull is good, too.

26:12.304 --> 26:15.107
I'm now at 1.2 times ten

26:15.141 --> 26:17.476
to the power of 18.

26:19.245 --> 26:20.747
Still clean.

26:22.348 --> 26:25.351
I mean, look at these
sucrose molecules.

26:26.853 --> 26:29.889
My sugar is sweet.

26:29.922 --> 26:32.258
I think the mouse is sweet.

26:32.291 --> 26:34.293
The mouse is dead.

26:34.326 --> 26:36.162
Well, he's still sweet.

26:36.195 --> 26:38.264
He's got a cute little face.

26:38.297 --> 26:41.100
Forest.
I think we're good.

26:41.133 --> 26:43.135
We can try
to extrapolate inwards.

26:44.436 --> 26:46.405
Cool.

26:46.438 --> 26:47.940
So do it.

26:49.541 --> 26:51.343
Okay.

26:51.377 --> 26:53.379
Let's see.

28:03.349 --> 28:05.351
Silence from the team.

28:09.288 --> 28:11.290
So it worked.

28:14.794 --> 28:17.696
Yeah.

28:17.730 --> 28:19.732
It worked.

28:20.767 --> 28:22.735
Keep going.

28:22.769 --> 28:24.771
Keep extrapolating?

28:25.872 --> 28:27.539
You mean outwards?

28:27.573 --> 28:29.375
Why not?

28:33.245 --> 28:36.215
We'll run out of memory
pretty fucking quick, but...

28:36.248 --> 28:38.550
yeah, why not?

28:38.584 --> 28:40.086
No harm it can do.

29:18.524 --> 29:20.526
Fuck.

30:00.833 --> 30:03.469
"And he made a house
called a cocoon

30:03.502 --> 30:06.038
"and he stayed in there
for, like,

30:06.072 --> 30:09.708
"two weeks.

30:09.741 --> 30:11.610
"More than two weeks,

30:11.643 --> 30:13.479
"and poof...

30:13.512 --> 30:16.015
"and poof,
he was a butterfly.

30:16.048 --> 30:19.852
"A beautiful, nice,
beautiful butterfly.

30:20.752 --> 30:22.321
The end."

30:22.354 --> 30:24.190
Is that the end?

30:24.223 --> 30:25.691
Yes.

30:25.724 --> 30:27.226
The end.

30:47.880 --> 30:49.581
Hey, sweetheart.

30:49.615 --> 30:51.417
Just wondering where you are.

30:54.520 --> 30:56.022
The milk.
Shit.

30:57.056 --> 31:00.026
No, totally forgot.

31:00.059 --> 31:03.195
I was going over papers
all morning and I...

31:03.229 --> 31:05.597
Uh, anyway, yeah, I forgot.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.102
Are you?

31:24.483 --> 31:25.985
Yeah, I see you.

31:28.420 --> 31:30.056
So, look, bring Amaya back
and then

31:30.089 --> 31:31.857
I'll take the car
and go to the store.

31:31.890 --> 31:33.492
I'll get stuff for dinner, too.

31:35.794 --> 31:37.796
I don't know.
Pasta?

31:40.832 --> 31:42.901
I know we can discuss it
in 30 seconds.

31:42.935 --> 31:44.603
-We can also discuss it now.

32:02.154 --> 32:03.655
No.

32:07.293 --> 32:08.794
No.

32:17.036 --> 32:18.537
No.

32:19.871 --> 32:21.373
No.

32:23.442 --> 32:24.943
No.

32:25.877 --> 32:28.647
No. No... No!

32:28.680 --> 32:30.149
No! No!

32:30.182 --> 32:32.784
No! No! No!

33:40.386 --> 33:42.354
Do you think any of them

33:42.388 --> 33:44.390
understand what we're really
doing here?

33:45.857 --> 33:47.359
I'm not sure.

33:52.364 --> 33:55.367
I'm not sure you even understand
what we're really doing here.

33:59.271 --> 34:00.772
What do you mean?

34:03.475 --> 34:06.912
I think Devs is how
you've put yourself on trial.

34:06.945 --> 34:08.447
It's judge and jury.

34:10.082 --> 34:11.717
If it works,

34:11.750 --> 34:13.885
determinism precludes
free will,

34:13.919 --> 34:16.122
and you're absolved,
you did no wrong.

34:16.155 --> 34:18.757
But if it doesn't work,

34:18.790 --> 34:21.460
you had choices.

34:21.493 --> 34:22.994
And you're guilty.

34:26.598 --> 34:28.600
If it doesn't work, I'm damned.

34:32.104 --> 34:34.106
Yes.
Pretty much.

34:40.412 --> 34:42.281
What's my place in this trial?

34:45.451 --> 34:47.419
You're a witness.

34:47.453 --> 34:49.455
No.

34:50.756 --> 34:52.758
I'm the lawyer for the defense.

34:57.629 --> 34:59.598
I'm gonna make
my opening argument.

34:59.631 --> 35:02.134
Are you ready?

35:04.002 --> 35:05.604
Um...

35:05.637 --> 35:07.139
no.

35:10.709 --> 35:12.211
Yeah.

36:24.450 --> 36:27.886
If I, uh...

36:27.919 --> 36:29.888
if I asked you
to do me a favor,

36:29.921 --> 36:32.424
but I couldn't tell you why,

36:32.458 --> 36:35.427
do you think
you could trust me, and...

36:35.461 --> 36:37.896
and not ask any questions,
and just do it?

36:39.698 --> 36:42.067
Ne...
I'm being serious.

36:46.472 --> 36:50.242
Okay.
So, I need you to get Mom.

36:50.276 --> 36:52.244
And get Lucy and Tom

36:52.278 --> 36:55.080
and their kids.

36:55.113 --> 36:58.016
And take them to the place
we used to go on vacation

36:58.049 --> 37:00.051
when me and Lucy were kids.

37:02.321 --> 37:04.323
Ne, the hotel by the lake.

37:09.160 --> 37:11.530
An...
For one week.

37:11.563 --> 37:14.032
And I don't care what
any of them say about school

37:14.065 --> 37:17.803
or jobs or feeding pets
or anything, I just...

37:17.836 --> 37:20.339
They have to do it.
You have to make them do it.

37:24.109 --> 37:26.111
I said I can't tell you why.

37:29.915 --> 37:31.417
No, Dad, you...

37:33.452 --> 37:36.121
You know how I work
for an Internet security firm?

37:38.457 --> 37:41.327
Well, we've been
subcontracting for the NSA

37:41.360 --> 37:43.061
and a foreign power
hacked our system

37:43.094 --> 37:45.964
and got all
our personal details.

37:45.997 --> 37:48.600
So the NSA instructed us
to-to make sure

37:48.634 --> 37:49.935
our immediate families were safe

37:49.968 --> 37:52.704
until they made everything...
okay.

37:57.108 --> 37:59.511
Yeah, we've got
major protection here.

37:59.545 --> 38:01.980
Guys with guns, you name it,
'round the clock.

38:03.114 --> 38:04.916
So, will you do it, Dad?

38:04.950 --> 38:06.452
Jebal.

38:11.457 --> 38:12.958
Thank you.

38:18.364 --> 38:21.032
Yeah, I'm totally fine.

38:21.066 --> 38:23.702
I love you too.
All you guys.

38:26.538 --> 38:28.173
Okay, Dad.
I got to go.

38:33.412 --> 38:34.913
Okay. Bye.

39:02.107 --> 39:04.510
So I need to add
an important caveat

39:04.543 --> 39:07.579
to our working relationship.

39:07.613 --> 39:09.581
I'm not going to prison.

39:09.615 --> 39:11.650
Do you understand?

39:11.683 --> 39:14.252
You need to fully
take that on board.

39:14.285 --> 39:17.055
You don't need to worry
about going to prison, Kenton.

39:17.088 --> 39:19.190
I disagree.

39:19.224 --> 39:21.993
I killed a guy,
I put his girl in a nuthouse

39:22.027 --> 39:25.731
and I terrorized her friend
into silence.

39:25.764 --> 39:28.567
Hopefully that does the trick.
But if it doesn't,

39:28.600 --> 39:31.870
and I feel this shit
is catching up with me,

39:31.903 --> 39:34.606
then the terms of our deal
are null and void.

39:34.640 --> 39:36.408
I will act

39:36.442 --> 39:38.877
in a self-interested manner.

39:41.312 --> 39:42.781
What does that mean?

39:42.814 --> 39:45.517
I just told you.
I'm not going to prison.

39:45.551 --> 39:48.219
You can't fuck me
without fucking yourself.

39:48.253 --> 39:50.856
Lily Chan is a threat.

39:50.889 --> 39:53.258
It's not in your power
to kill her, Kenton.

39:54.560 --> 39:56.061
Have we met?

39:57.429 --> 39:59.798
I didn't say you lack
the ability to kill her.

39:59.831 --> 40:01.867
I said it's not in your power.

40:01.900 --> 40:04.803
Well, I'll tell you what.

40:04.836 --> 40:06.838
You just let me
worry about that.

43:18.196 --> 43:19.698
Lily?

43:21.266 --> 43:22.768
Lily?

43:24.269 --> 43:26.437
I'm getting you out.

43:28.139 --> 43:29.574
What?

43:29.607 --> 43:31.476
I love you, baby.

43:31.509 --> 43:33.578
Oh, I wish you did,
but you don't.

43:33.611 --> 43:35.580
It's just the dope talking.

43:35.613 --> 43:36.782
Come on, let's go.

43:40.351 --> 43:43.822
-That's it.

43:45.691 --> 43:48.026
-There you go.

43:48.059 --> 43:51.129
-Okay.

46:13.471 --> 46:15.473
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

46:20.511 --> 46:21.679
What is Devs?

46:23.849 --> 46:25.583
What is Devs?

46:25.616 --> 46:26.885
What is Devs?

46:27.785 --> 46:29.687
What is Devs?

46:29.720 --> 46:31.489
-What is Devs?

46:32.390 --> 46:33.524
What is Devs?

46:34.492 --> 46:35.526
What is Devs?

46:50.976 --> 46:53.178
I had no idea
what I would find

46:53.211 --> 46:55.013
when I went searching
for my father.

46:55.046 --> 46:57.815
They flashed the Zodiac Killer,
and my heart stopped.

46:57.849 --> 47:00.551
He believes
he is the son of the Zodiac.

47:06.491 --> 47:08.059
I'm gonna miss you so much,

47:08.093 --> 47:10.161
but we can speak on the computer
so you'll see my face.

47:10.195 --> 47:12.230
But we won't be able
to touch you.

47:12.263 --> 47:13.731
Hey, look.
You'll still have me.

47:13.764 --> 47:16.701
-Just you?
-Yes. Just-- Your father. Hi.

47:22.440 --> 47:25.010
-I'm a
once-in-a-generation artist.
-Oh.

47:25.043 --> 47:28.146
Who just got verified
on Twitter, about,
what, nine days ago?

47:28.179 --> 47:30.415
I'm glad you feel good
that a robot told you
you're worth it.

47:38.789 --> 47:40.091
-Mom.
-Yes?

47:40.125 --> 47:42.527
-Okay. I want
a big party this year.
-Serious?

47:42.560 --> 47:44.762
-I want a quinceaÃ±era.
-QuinceaÃ±era?

47:44.795 --> 47:48.133
We can't do that.
We're too white for that.
We're not allowed.

47:54.639 --> 47:57.675
Looks like one
of my codpieces.

47:57.708 --> 48:00.045
-Except not as big.

48:00.078 --> 48:02.880
What are you waiting for?
Take your instrument,
use my body

48:02.914 --> 48:05.083
and perform your special
blood ritual.

48:05.116 --> 48:07.618
Kyle.

48:13.424 --> 48:14.425
Hey!
