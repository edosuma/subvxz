WEBVTT

00:10.411 --> 00:11.948
<i>Tessa, honey, you home?</i>

00:11.950 --> 00:14.453
Oh, she wanted to stay
at Kimmy's one more night.

00:14.454 --> 00:15.598
Well, of course.

00:15.600 --> 00:17.458
Parents aren't nearly as cool
as Kimmy.

00:17.461 --> 00:19.552
Mm, not a chance.

00:21.515 --> 00:24.970
- We having a red or a white?
- A pink.

00:24.972 --> 00:28.427
Raul the towel boy taught me
his secret cocktail recipe.

00:28.430 --> 00:31.585
- It's on my phone.
- Raul with the muscles?

00:32.850 --> 00:34.675
When were you mixing cocktails
with him?

00:34.678 --> 00:36.270
Right after my husband

00:36.273 --> 00:38.796
decided to cut our
Mexican vacation short

00:38.799 --> 00:40.925
so he could make
a business meeting.

00:40.926 --> 00:42.720
You think I'm jealous, but I'm not.

00:42.721 --> 00:45.776
- I know you love this dad bod.
- I do.

00:45.778 --> 00:49.367
- Now, slice me a lemon.
- Yes, ma'am.

00:49.368 --> 00:52.026
You think Raul would go all
the way into the kitchen

00:52.028 --> 00:54.916
- to get you a lemon?
- Thanks, sweetie.

01:01.167 --> 01:04.822
- Gonna have to be a lime, hon.
- That's fine.

_

01:23.103 --> 01:26.008
<i>Thank heaven for tiny miracles, huh?</i>

01:26.043 --> 01:28.180
<i>If Banyan hadn't left his blood
on that cutting board,</i>

01:28.183 --> 01:30.208
<i>we wouldn't be starting the trial today</i>

01:30.211 --> 01:31.504
<i>and he wouldn't be looking</i>

01:31.507 --> 01:33.731
<i>at a long sentence for robbery
and homicide.</i>

01:33.734 --> 01:36.158
- Witness list?
- Yep.

01:36.159 --> 01:39.183
M.E. report confirming Banyan's
blood on the cutting board?

01:39.185 --> 01:42.340
- Yep.
- Initial response report indicating

01:42.343 --> 01:44.101
that Hammonds' side door
was open?

01:44.104 --> 01:45.231
Yes.

01:45.233 --> 01:46.961
Search warrant
for Banyan's apartment?

01:46.963 --> 01:48.888
Yep.
Fat lot of good it did us.

01:48.889 --> 01:50.848
No knife, no red emeralds.

01:50.851 --> 01:52.211
Oh, maybe Nina can provide us

01:52.212 --> 01:54.040
with some up to the minute
good news?

01:54.042 --> 01:55.722
Sorry, I double checked with NCIC,

01:55.724 --> 01:57.504
and all the local pawn shop records.

01:57.506 --> 01:59.085
<i>Unfortunately, the red emeralds</i>

01:59.088 --> 02:01.003
stolen from the house
haven't turned up.

02:01.005 --> 02:02.719
Finding them after two years
was a long shot.

02:02.720 --> 02:05.476
- Thanks for making the calls.
- Thanks.

02:05.479 --> 02:07.394
So, we have no murder weapon,

02:07.397 --> 02:09.883
and without the gems,
we have no motive.

02:09.886 --> 02:11.969
There's no chance we're gonna
lose this case, are we?

02:11.972 --> 02:14.694
Oh, we've won cases with less
than DNA on a cutting board.

02:14.697 --> 02:18.161
I'm just glad we have this.

02:18.162 --> 02:19.438
Oh. We have to meet
Banyan's lawyer

02:19.440 --> 02:21.085
at the evidence warehouse
in five minutes.

02:21.088 --> 02:24.216
Okay. Rizzoli.

02:24.217 --> 02:27.391
What do you mean it's gone?

02:29.229 --> 02:30.708
I have no idea what happened.

02:30.710 --> 02:33.701
After you checked out the cutting
board for trial prep last week,

02:33.704 --> 02:35.518
I put it right back
where it belonged.

02:35.521 --> 02:36.965
And nobody's checked it out since?

02:36.966 --> 02:41.373
Uh... no. Other than you, it's
been in the same spot for two years.

02:41.374 --> 02:44.231
Then when the defense sent their
request to review the evidence,

02:44.233 --> 02:47.460
I made myself a little note to have
it ready first thing this morning.

02:47.462 --> 02:49.715
So, as soon as defense made
the request, it disappears?

02:49.716 --> 02:54.997
Yeah. Here we are.
B572.

02:54.999 --> 02:57.351
<i>No cutting board.</i>

02:57.354 --> 02:59.269
- Did you check the adjacent boxes?
- Yes.

02:59.271 --> 03:01.896
Okay, we need to search
every box in here.

03:01.898 --> 03:03.091
There's four floors of evidence.

03:03.094 --> 03:04.554
I really don't have the manpower
for that.

03:04.556 --> 03:08.012
- You will.
- Thanks.

03:08.013 --> 03:10.670
We got to call Banyan's lawyer
and tell him it's gone.

03:10.673 --> 03:12.732
The lawyer's gonna move
to dismiss the case.

03:32.885 --> 03:35.535
7x09 - 65 Hours

03:36.536 --> 03:39.525
Hey, ma.
It come yet?

03:39.527 --> 03:43.082
Honey, you have the strangest
shopping habits.

03:43.084 --> 03:46.838
You opened it?
What if it was private?

03:46.841 --> 03:49.066
You had it shipped to a bar!

03:49.067 --> 03:51.958
So Nina wouldn't see it.
She likes magic shows.

03:51.959 --> 03:53.652
Thought I'd learn a few
tricks, surprise her.

03:53.655 --> 03:55.947
You're such a sweet, sweet boy.

03:57.411 --> 03:59.604
Awesome.

04:03.928 --> 04:05.321
Rizzoli.

04:05.323 --> 04:09.078
What?
All right, I'm there.

04:10.243 --> 04:12.801
Sorry, ma.
I got to go.

04:12.804 --> 04:15.527
- Work.
- Of course it's work.

04:15.528 --> 04:19.615
- My kids always work.
- Bye!

04:19.618 --> 04:20.911
Bye!

04:25.136 --> 04:26.995
Is it possible that someone
from your office

04:26.997 --> 04:29.554
- got the cutting board?
- I'm afraid not.

04:29.557 --> 04:30.951
And there's no other
physical evidence

04:30.953 --> 04:34.076
- that ties Banyan to the scene?
- No, but here's what we have.

04:34.078 --> 04:36.835
We have the swab that we used
to retrieve Banyan's DNA.

04:36.838 --> 04:39.527
We have photos of the cutting
board from the crime scene

04:39.529 --> 04:42.188
and in the lab,
and DNA documentation proving

04:42.190 --> 04:43.650
that it was Banyan's blood.

04:43.651 --> 04:46.475
The defense won't be able to
dispute chain of custody.

04:46.477 --> 04:49.068
It's a hail Mary,

04:49.070 --> 04:50.831
but it might be enough
to put in front of a judge.

04:50.832 --> 04:53.209
"Hail Mary"
is such an odd phrase.

04:53.210 --> 04:55.212
You know, when it was coined in 1975 ...

04:55.214 --> 05:00.322
Maura, Jane, go, court, now.
Thanks. Bye.

05:01.330 --> 05:04.045
<i>Along with the
photographs and lab report,</i>

05:04.047 --> 05:07.308
the sworn testimony of Chief
Medical Examiner Dr. Maura Isles

05:07.310 --> 05:09.515
should be more than
enough to proceed.

05:09.518 --> 05:11.792
Your Honor, defense
simply can't run its own

05:11.794 --> 05:14.067
forensic analysis on
a series of photographs.

05:14.070 --> 05:16.888
If the people can't produce the
cutting board for our review,

05:16.890 --> 05:18.654
this case needs to be dismissed.

05:18.656 --> 05:20.115
Counselors, approach the bench.

05:22.155 --> 05:25.720
- Jane?
- Yeah.

05:25.722 --> 05:28.880
- What's going on?
- Tessa, something happened, okay?

05:28.883 --> 05:31.191
But we're ... we're working
on it. Okay?

05:31.193 --> 05:33.296
- Detective Rizzoli.
- Just hang tight.

05:33.298 --> 05:35.641
I've been told there's a problem
with evidence management.

05:35.643 --> 05:37.883
Uh, yes, Your Honor.

05:37.885 --> 05:41.722
We, um ... we're working hard to
produce the physical evidence

05:41.724 --> 05:46.919
that the defense has asked for.
Um...

05:46.921 --> 05:48.891
we just need some more time.

05:48.892 --> 05:52.355
I sympathize with your
predicament, Detective,

05:52.357 --> 05:56.126
but without evidence,
this case cannot go to trial.

05:56.128 --> 05:58.084
<i>As it is 4:00 p.m. Friday,</i>

05:58.086 --> 06:01.019
you have until 9:00 a.m. Monday
to find this evidence,

06:01.022 --> 06:03.364
or else I'll be forced to grant
defense's motion to dismiss.

06:04.385 --> 06:05.334
<i>Next case.</i>

06:08.971 --> 06:10.702
Banyan did this.

06:12.131 --> 06:14.302
I don't know how he did it,
but he did it.

06:14.304 --> 06:17.836
Well, we better get going, 'cause
we've only got 65 hours to undo it.

06:38.313 --> 06:40.994
We've already finished
with rows 1 through 8.

06:40.998 --> 06:43.611
You can check rows 9
through 11 down there.

06:44.903 --> 06:47.009
Any luck?

06:47.011 --> 06:49.115
No cutting board
in the first two sections.

06:49.116 --> 06:51.426
We got 10 more sections to
search on this floor.

06:51.427 --> 06:53.395
Any evidence missing
from any other cases?

06:53.397 --> 06:55.807
It's definitely looking like
a targeted job.

06:55.810 --> 06:58.764
Did you speak to the evidence
officers who were on duty?

06:58.765 --> 07:01.278
None of them saw
any suspicious activity.

07:01.280 --> 07:03.248
Banyan could've paid
one of them off.

07:03.250 --> 07:05.387
I ran background checks
on all employees

07:05.389 --> 07:07.188
with access to the evidence room.

07:07.191 --> 07:10.551
All of them long-term employees,
no apparent financial motive,

07:10.554 --> 07:13.677
- no apparent ties to Banyan.
- So, if it's not an inside job,

07:13.679 --> 07:15.478
someone from the outside broke in.

07:15.480 --> 07:17.755
Only way in is the way we came.

07:23.770 --> 07:25.601
What's up?

07:25.604 --> 07:27.537
Banyan got someone to break in
and steal the cutting board.

07:27.540 --> 07:29.101
Trying to figure out
how they might've got in.

07:29.103 --> 07:31.853
- Is this the only point of entry?
- Yeah. To be granted access,

07:31.855 --> 07:34.843
you have to enter a six-digit
code that's changed every week.

07:34.845 --> 07:36.886
Yeah, and I'm sure the system
logs in the date

07:36.887 --> 07:38.157
and time of everyone's entry.

07:38.159 --> 07:39.631
Yeah. Those records are already
on their way.

07:39.633 --> 07:41.406
Okay.

07:43.014 --> 07:44.754
Tell me about the security system.

07:44.755 --> 07:46.426
The evidence officer we spoke to

07:46.428 --> 07:48.469
said they recently upgraded
the facility.

07:48.471 --> 07:51.181
Beside the keypad they put in
a new climate-control system

07:51.183 --> 07:53.424
and additional security cameras.

07:53.426 --> 07:55.903
Get the footage from the last week.
We need to review that.

07:55.904 --> 07:57.039
If boa was only
taken in the last day or two,

07:57.041 --> 07:58.279
maybe it's still out there.

07:58.282 --> 08:01.687
It's a good thing Ming's Palace
is open all night.

08:06.450 --> 08:09.661
Okay, what are we looking at?

08:09.663 --> 08:11.806
<i>Left side is a list
of every date and time</i>

08:11.808 --> 08:13.815
<i>that someone entered
the evidence room.</i>

08:13.816 --> 08:15.554
<i>And the right side is different</i>

08:15.556 --> 08:17.329
<i>security camera feeds
from the warehouse.</i>

08:17.332 --> 08:20.578
We're going through to see
if we can identify the thief.

08:21.584 --> 08:23.524
Oh, right there, right there!
Bottom right.

08:23.526 --> 08:26.838
- Blow that up.
- Back it up.

08:28.982 --> 08:33.133
Now enhance it.
There's the code, clear as day.

08:33.135 --> 08:35.342
Nina, is this camera system
closed circuit?

08:35.345 --> 08:38.321
Yes, but sometimes these systems
have a remote login function

08:38.323 --> 08:40.130
so that supervisors can check in.

08:40.131 --> 08:42.440
If our thief could log in remotely,
he could get the code.

08:42.441 --> 08:44.583
- Mm-hmm.
- Hang on.

08:44.584 --> 08:47.429
<i>Most of these logins look like
warehouse supervisors,</i>

08:47.430 --> 08:51.581
- but this one's anonymous.
- That's how our crooks got the code.

08:51.583 --> 08:53.556
Is there any way to trace that login?

08:53.557 --> 08:55.933
Yes, but it could take more time
than we have.

08:55.934 --> 08:58.076
Okay, well, we know
when they got the code,

08:58.077 --> 09:00.820
so let's just look for it every
time it was used going forward.

09:02.731 --> 09:05.809
Hey, um, can I have
the honey walnut shrimp?

09:05.810 --> 09:10.563
- Uh, yeah.
- Thanks.

09:10.566 --> 09:14.011
- There's no shrimp.
- There's a lot of honey, a lot of walnuts.

09:14.014 --> 09:16.557
<i>Hey, wait, someone
just blacked out the camera</i>

09:16.558 --> 09:18.699
<i>covering the entrance
to the evidence room.</i>

09:18.702 --> 09:20.870
<i>Could they have
gotten into the building</i>

09:20.870 --> 09:22.316
<i>from another room down there?</i>

09:22.318 --> 09:24.525
Well, the only rooms down there
are the maintenance room

09:24.526 --> 09:25.630
and the evidence room.

09:25.631 --> 09:28.006
They're made of concrete.
No way in.

09:28.009 --> 09:30.083
We need to look at all
of Banyan's associates,

09:30.084 --> 09:32.259
figure out who's smart enough
to pull this off.

09:44.581 --> 09:48.012
CSRU didn't find any physical
evidence at the warehouse.

09:48.013 --> 09:50.042
So, our thief got in and out
without a trace?

09:50.045 --> 09:52.240
Yeah, and no prints
on the evidence box,

09:52.243 --> 09:56.704
- but we will do a full battery of tests.
- Thank you.

09:56.707 --> 09:59.003
<i>Kent?
What are you working on?</i>

09:59.005 --> 10:01.700
Oh, I, uh...

10:01.702 --> 10:05.133
I found him in the pond
by my house this morning.

10:06.734 --> 10:08.797
- Is it sick?
- Yeah.

10:08.799 --> 10:11.495
Won't even take any water,
not even this fancy stuff

10:11.497 --> 10:13.526
with added electrolytes and vitamins.

10:13.528 --> 10:15.858
I got you a few liters
I stuck on your desk.

10:15.859 --> 10:17.357
Thank you.

10:17.360 --> 10:20.654
Yeah, you're both healing.
You ladies deserve the best.

10:20.657 --> 10:25.018
- Was the pond you found it in dirty?
- Aren't all ponds?

10:25.021 --> 10:27.584
Well, if the water was polluted,
a duck can contract botulism.

10:27.585 --> 10:31.082
Oh, of course.
Good one, Sergeant.

10:31.084 --> 10:33.163
When I was a kid, my aunt had a place up

10:33.165 --> 10:35.245
on Lake Winnipesaukee.
I used to feed the ducks.

10:35.248 --> 10:37.044
We may have some antitoxin on hand.

10:37.045 --> 10:38.941
Or you can just give it
water with Epsom salt.

10:38.944 --> 10:42.573
- Right! Old wives' remedy.
- The old wives are the ones

10:42.574 --> 10:44.872
that gave me the bread
to feed the ducks.

10:44.873 --> 10:47.969
You know, you two are alike.
Both animal lovers.

10:48.971 --> 10:51.966
- I don't think we're alike.
- No, me neither.

10:51.969 --> 10:54.432
Call me if you get something.

10:55.999 --> 10:58.595
I'm thinking of calling her
Mary, as in Mary Stuart.

10:58.598 --> 11:00.495
As in Mary, Queen of Scots?

11:00.496 --> 11:02.292
She deserves a royal name,
don't you think?

11:02.295 --> 11:03.492
Such a regal creature.

11:03.495 --> 11:06.024
<i>Well, except Mary Stuart
was executed by her cousin,</i>

11:06.025 --> 11:08.789
Queen Elizabeth.
So, maybe she should have the name

11:08.790 --> 11:10.220
of a queen that wasn't beheaded.

11:10.223 --> 11:12.719
Well, I'm not gonna call
her Elizabeth.

11:12.720 --> 11:15.201
No English queen is a queen to me.

11:24.180 --> 11:26.275
Billy Mags was arrested
with Banyan in the '90s,

11:26.278 --> 11:28.108
<i>but he's doing a 20-year bit
at Walpole.</i>

11:28.111 --> 11:29.840
"Whitey" McCormick
was hanging his hat

11:29.843 --> 11:31.572
at Souza-Baranowski
for the last year.

11:31.575 --> 11:34.169
Well, Jones got in trouble
with the law in Mexico.

11:34.171 --> 11:36.080
And Finch has been dead for two years.

11:36.083 --> 11:38.677
Frankie, what's going on
with the prison logs?

11:38.678 --> 11:43.698
And the ball magically melds
with the cup.

11:43.699 --> 11:46.021
- Frankie!
- What?

11:46.022 --> 11:48.171
I'm on hold. They're taking
forever to pull the logs.

11:48.173 --> 11:51.144
Moving at a snail's pace.

11:51.145 --> 11:52.747
No.

11:52.748 --> 11:54.644
I saw the second ball hit the
table before the cup dropped.

11:54.647 --> 11:56.477
You did not.
Yeah.

11:56.480 --> 11:59.226
No, yeah, I'm still here.
Mm-hmm.

11:59.227 --> 12:00.993
Are you sure?

12:00.994 --> 12:03.054
All right, thank you very much.

12:03.055 --> 12:06.654
So, apparently the only person
who visited Banyan in prison

12:06.656 --> 12:08.550
is his 82-year-old mother.

12:08.552 --> 12:10.154
No friends, barely any family.

12:10.157 --> 12:13.126
Who the hell is helping Banyan?

12:13.130 --> 12:17.678
- Pizza and Chinese, eh?
- Yeah, it was a long night.

12:17.679 --> 12:19.842
And there was a shrimp deficiency.

12:19.845 --> 12:24.448
I did a particle trace analysis
on the empty evidence box.

12:24.451 --> 12:26.412
Found traces of
urea-formaldehyde foam.

12:26.413 --> 12:28.783
- Which is used for what?
- It's an insulation

12:28.784 --> 12:31.151
most commonly found in
old commercial buildings.

12:31.154 --> 12:32.473
Like the evidence warehouse.

12:32.474 --> 12:35.893
Yeah, except the only place we
found it was on the evidence box.

12:35.894 --> 12:39.583
Well, that means that the thief
must have left it on the box

12:39.586 --> 12:41.230
when he opened it to steal
the cutting board.

12:41.233 --> 12:44.096
Didn't you say something about
a, uh, climate system?

12:44.099 --> 12:46.107
Yeah, they installed it six months ago

12:46.109 --> 12:48.346
for better temperature
and humidity control.

12:48.349 --> 12:50.619
To install a new system, wouldn't
you need to cut through walls?

12:50.622 --> 12:51.971
Yes, you would.

12:51.972 --> 12:54.615
Yes, you would.
Thank you.

12:54.906 --> 12:57.143
You're... welcome.

13:08.810 --> 13:11.443
All these vents required a cut
through the wall

13:11.445 --> 13:16.452
- and the interior insulation.
- Mm-hmm.

13:16.454 --> 13:18.823
<i>Hey, Korsak, look at this.</i>

13:18.825 --> 13:21.623
- You see the insulation?
- Mm.

13:21.625 --> 13:23.732
That vent looks bigger
than the other ones?

13:23.735 --> 13:25.664
Yeah.

13:30.688 --> 13:32.232
It's magnetized.

13:35.605 --> 13:37.954
Guess we know how they
got into the building.

13:48.886 --> 13:51.748
So, the thief built
a tunnel from outside

13:51.748 --> 13:54.609
to the maintenance room,
walked across the hall,

13:54.612 --> 13:57.488
entered the entrance code
to the evidence room,

13:57.491 --> 13:59.070
and stole our cutting board.

13:59.071 --> 14:03.776
- Seems like something out of "Ocean's 11."
- Or "12." Or "13."

14:03.777 --> 14:06.936
Somebody's been planning this
for a long time.

14:06.938 --> 14:09.043
Six months at least,

14:09.044 --> 14:12.870
since they installed
the climate-control system.

14:12.873 --> 14:15.117
Whoever's helping Banyan
was on that crew.

14:15.120 --> 14:18.102
Yeah. I already got a list
from the contractor.

14:18.105 --> 14:21.231
- 50 people altogether.
- Well, we better start digging.

14:22.397 --> 14:25.888
- We only have 41 hours left.
- Dig fast.

14:31.181 --> 14:33.375
Hi, I got your text.
You found something?

14:33.378 --> 14:36.437
Yes. CSRU found several hairs
in that tunnel.

14:36.438 --> 14:39.897
DNA analysis shows they belong
to a Caucasian woman.

14:39.899 --> 14:42.591
Okay, well, that'll help
narrow our search

14:42.594 --> 14:44.256
for the construction crew.

14:44.257 --> 14:46.584
- Thanks, Maura.
- You look tired.

14:46.587 --> 14:48.447
Jane, are you sure you don't
want to lie down,

14:48.449 --> 14:50.178
take a little power nap,
maybe 20 minutes?

14:50.179 --> 14:51.975
- I don't have 20 minutes.
- I'm serious.

14:51.976 --> 14:55.035
Sleep deprivation could cause
cognitive dysfunction,

14:55.037 --> 14:57.365
memory problems, even hallucinations.

14:57.366 --> 14:58.712
I'm fine.

14:58.713 --> 15:01.572
You should tell the octopus in
the corner to stop waving at me.

15:12.529 --> 15:14.817
Yeah.

15:17.006 --> 15:18.048
Good girl.

15:18.049 --> 15:20.673
Okay, this is the weirdest thing

15:20.676 --> 15:22.355
I've seen in the last week
and a half.

15:22.358 --> 15:24.881
I'm sorry.
She's sick.

15:24.882 --> 15:26.496
I couldn't very well leave her
in the lab, could I?

15:26.497 --> 15:28.043
You have to take her back!

15:28.045 --> 15:30.871
Somebody might call
the Health Department on me.

15:30.874 --> 15:33.530
The rights of nursing mothers
should not be infringed upon

15:33.533 --> 15:35.584
- in the commonwealth.
- What?

15:35.585 --> 15:38.243
All right, well, I know
it's not the same thing,

15:38.244 --> 15:40.464
but surely the same principle applies.

15:40.465 --> 15:44.032
Okay, now I'm more worried
about you than I am the duck.

15:44.033 --> 15:47.898
- Even though she's kind of sweet.
- Isn't she?

15:49.284 --> 15:51.988
Hello.
Yes, say hello, Cleopatra.

15:51.990 --> 15:54.637
- That's a good girl, yeah.
- Fancy name.

15:54.640 --> 15:56.550
Yeah, Egyptian queen
of the desert.

15:56.551 --> 15:58.963
<i>- Beloved by all.
- Mm.</i>

15:58.966 --> 16:01.243
I learned in my G.E.D. class
that, uh,

16:01.246 --> 16:05.067
her brother tried to overthrow
her, so she had him killed.

16:05.068 --> 16:08.252
Oh, right.
So, maybe not Cleopatra, then.

16:10.131 --> 16:11.237
What?

16:13.350 --> 16:16.166
Okay, so the food's ready,

16:16.167 --> 16:18.714
and that's so nice of you
to bring it to them.

16:18.717 --> 16:21.306
- Thank you.
- Well, I guess we're just not

16:21.410 --> 16:24.617
as slammed down in the M.E.'s
office as they are upstairs.

16:24.618 --> 16:27.467
By the way, do you see, uh,
Frankie and Nina a bit?

16:27.468 --> 16:30.384
- How's that going?
- I guess you're gonna have to ask them.

16:30.385 --> 16:32.597
We keep it strictly
professional at work.

16:32.598 --> 16:35.313
Yeah. I can see.

16:36.556 --> 16:37.995
Hmm, fair point.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.503
Do you mind if I break her
a wee bite off,

16:39.506 --> 16:40.509
see if she's hungry?

16:40.512 --> 16:42.991
- Oh, no, not that one.
- Why not?

16:42.993 --> 16:44.920
<i>Duck a l'orange.</i>

16:46.293 --> 16:48.972
Hey there. It's okay.

16:48.975 --> 16:51.193
Yeah.

16:57.993 --> 17:00.148
<i>There were only four
Caucasian women</i>

17:00.149 --> 17:01.879
on the construction crew that installed

17:01.882 --> 17:03.578
the climate-control system.

17:03.581 --> 17:06.617
One of them, Ashley Marks, was
hired two weeks before the job

17:06.619 --> 17:07.924
and quit immediately after.

17:07.926 --> 17:11.194
- That's more than a little suspicious.
- Turns out she's a licensed

17:11.194 --> 17:14.036
heating and cleaning service
tech, but in Chicago.

17:14.038 --> 17:15.570
Could she have been in town working?

17:15.573 --> 17:17.509
Sure, if she hadn't
been severely injured

17:17.511 --> 17:19.036
in an accident three years ago.

17:19.037 --> 17:22.871
<i>According to these disability
records, she hasn't worked since.</i>

17:22.874 --> 17:25.068
This also popped up in the search.

17:26.186 --> 17:29.697
- Who's Donna Marks?
- Ashley's sister.

17:29.700 --> 17:32.017
<i>She had several run-ins
with the law back in Chicago.</i>

17:32.020 --> 17:33.853
<i>She could've used
her sister's work I.D.</i>

17:33.855 --> 17:35.819
since she's been living here
for six months.

17:35.820 --> 17:40.459
- She could be the one helping Banyan.
- Is there anything linking them?

17:40.461 --> 17:42.649
E-mails, cellphone records,
love letters?

17:42.652 --> 17:45.516
- I'm looking, but nothing so far.
- All right.

17:45.519 --> 17:48.352
Hey, will you text me her address?

17:48.354 --> 17:50.153
It's already in your phone.

17:58.600 --> 18:01.184
Sounds like she's home.

18:12.329 --> 18:14.596
We got a runner!

18:18.023 --> 18:19.662
<i>Boston police!</i>

18:21.690 --> 18:24.971
<i>Hey!
Boston police!</i>

18:24.973 --> 18:26.823
All right, get down!
Get down.

18:26.824 --> 18:28.290
<i>You're under arrest.</i>

18:30.528 --> 18:31.888
What'd you do with
the cutting board, Donna?

18:31.890 --> 18:34.019
- Huh?
- I found it.

18:48.130 --> 18:51.375
<i>You destroyed evidence that could've
convicted a double murderer. </i>

18:51.377 --> 18:53.471
Do you have any idea how much
trouble you're in?

18:53.473 --> 18:56.196
<i>What I can't figure out
is why you did it.</i>

18:56.197 --> 18:58.221
You don't seem to
know Steve Banyan.

18:58.223 --> 19:01.156
There's no correspondence
between the two of you at all.

19:01.158 --> 19:04.019
There's no e-mails, no texts,
no phone calls, nothing.

19:04.021 --> 19:05.837
You only moved to Boston
six months ago.

19:05.839 --> 19:07.529
Banyan's been locked up
for two years.

19:09.189 --> 19:11.828
Why would you do something like
this for a complete stranger?

19:12.236 --> 19:14.095
Maybe it felt like a thrill.

19:14.099 --> 19:17.346
Yeah, you brought quite the rap
sheet with you from Chicago.

19:17.348 --> 19:20.290
- Assault and battery, prostitution ...
- Yeah, I know. I was there.

19:20.293 --> 19:21.847
<i>What I don't see there</i>

19:21.849 --> 19:24.081
is any higher education
or technical training.

19:24.083 --> 19:27.196
- So?
- So you have no technical knowledge

19:27.199 --> 19:28.889
to bypass a security system.

19:28.890 --> 19:32.556
If you don't think I did it,
then let me go.

19:32.591 --> 19:35.117
No, no, no. We know you did it.
We have your DNA.

19:35.120 --> 19:37.319
What we want to know is
who planned it.

19:39.520 --> 19:41.405
I don't know
what you're talking about.

19:42.930 --> 19:44.716
You know that if you give us a name,

19:44.718 --> 19:47.233
we can talk to the D.A. about
reducing your sentence.

19:50.316 --> 19:53.094
Understand this, Donna.

19:53.096 --> 19:57.896
Whoever planned this risked
your ass, not theirs.

19:59.588 --> 20:03.425
You really want to stand up
for somebody like that?

20:07.435 --> 20:09.420
<i>It's a pretty ring.</i>

20:10.945 --> 20:12.301
Yes, it is.

20:20.515 --> 20:22.700
Tell me you have good news.

20:22.702 --> 20:25.347
It appears she burned it,
doused it in lighter fluid,

20:25.349 --> 20:28.328
and then she burned it again.
No traces of DNA.

20:28.331 --> 20:30.646
I can't even confirm that this
is the same cutting board

20:30.649 --> 20:33.197
- from the victim's kitchen.
- So, you're telling me

20:33.199 --> 20:36.838
that the only piece of evidence
we have against Banyan ...

20:36.840 --> 20:39.023
Exists only in photographs
and test results.

20:39.025 --> 20:41.508
But you know that she broke in
and she stole it,

20:41.510 --> 20:42.733
so can't you use that?

20:42.734 --> 20:45.680
No, not without a connection
between Banyan and Donna,

20:45.681 --> 20:49.156
- which we don't have.
- So, what are you gonna do?

20:49.158 --> 20:50.945
Keep digging, I guess.

20:50.947 --> 20:53.496
Well, I do have an extra set
of clothes in my office

20:53.497 --> 20:56.167
if you'd like to dig in a fresh shirt.

20:57.571 --> 21:00.549
At this point, it'd be a public service.

21:02.428 --> 21:06.211
Hey.
This ring belonged to Donna.

21:06.212 --> 21:08.256
What kind of stone is that?

21:10.065 --> 21:13.581
It's too light to be a sapphire
or blue topaz.

21:13.584 --> 21:17.903
My off-the-cuff assessment
might be a blue benitoite.

21:17.904 --> 21:19.545
Extremely rare.

21:20.852 --> 21:22.647
Rare like red emeralds

21:22.649 --> 21:25.340
that were stolen from the Hammond house?

21:25.343 --> 21:28.053
Well, depends on clarity and color,

21:28.056 --> 21:30.936
but stones like this could go
for $20,000 each.

21:30.937 --> 21:33.380
Are you thinking that Donna
and Banyan pulled another job?

21:33.382 --> 21:35.155
Maybe.

21:35.157 --> 21:37.267
Or maybe it was Donna
and the guy she's working for.

21:37.269 --> 21:40.080
- Who's that?
- I don't know yet.

21:40.082 --> 21:42.124
Here we go.

21:42.929 --> 21:48.120
Come on!
Looks like a radioactive booger.

21:48.122 --> 21:51.681
Okay, this is citrine.
It's very fashionable.

21:52.343 --> 21:56.462
Also has the added benefit of
being visible from space.

21:58.274 --> 22:00.852
You can't see it from space.

22:02.052 --> 22:04.831
I don't think.

22:18.375 --> 22:22.225
- Morning, Holiday.
- Is it morning? I'm losing track.

22:22.227 --> 22:24.089
Walk with me.

22:24.092 --> 22:27.241
Donna had a rare gemstone on
her person ... blue benitoite.

22:27.243 --> 22:30.158
- Search for thefts involving that stone.
- Okay.

22:30.160 --> 22:32.124
I'd expand my search
outside of Boston.

22:32.125 --> 22:33.921
We're looking for
Donna's accomplice.

22:33.922 --> 22:36.327
Whoever she's protecting
will connect back to Banyan.

22:36.329 --> 22:38.395
Any cities you want me to focus on?

22:38.397 --> 22:39.955
Well, Chicago's Donna's hometown.

22:39.957 --> 22:42.440
- How is this gonna help?
- It might not, but if we can find

22:42.442 --> 22:44.661
who Banyan was working
with, maybe we can get him

22:44.662 --> 22:46.882
to turn on Banyan in exchange
for special treatment.

22:46.883 --> 22:48.373
- Got it.
- I'll meet you in BRIC.

22:48.374 --> 22:49.964
I got to take this to Kent.

22:49.967 --> 22:53.609
- What, he can't fetch his own coffee?
- This isn't coffee.

22:55.865 --> 23:00.039
Ew! I must be delusional from
lack of sleep this weekend.

23:00.042 --> 23:01.532
Things are moving.

23:01.534 --> 23:03.951
They're wormies for the wee duck.

23:03.952 --> 23:06.569
- Wormies?
- What would you call them?

23:06.570 --> 23:07.993
Disgusting?

23:08.890 --> 23:12.102
- I'll see you in BRIC.
- Ugh.

23:15.222 --> 23:17.342
- Hi.
- Hi, what's up?

23:17.343 --> 23:20.162
I just put on a fresh pot.
Should be ready soon.

23:23.674 --> 23:27.575
I'm trying to do the
coin-through-the-hand trick.

23:30.236 --> 23:33.051
No, you're not.
Okay, give me the coin.

23:33.053 --> 23:35.834
- What?
- Give me the coin.

23:35.836 --> 23:37.161
You're doing it all wrong.

23:37.162 --> 23:39.349
You have to make it look
effortless, okay?

23:39.350 --> 23:41.336
- Yeah.
- Seamless. Cup your hands.

23:41.338 --> 23:42.894
<i>- Like that?
- Yeah, exactly.</i>

23:42.896 --> 23:46.110
<i>- Ready? One, two, three.
- What?!</i>

23:46.111 --> 23:48.496
- That was amazing!
- Yes, I know.

23:48.498 --> 23:49.557
How'd you learn that?

23:49.559 --> 23:52.242
Do you remember
when we were little

23:52.243 --> 23:54.394
I always got to go to bed
an hour after you?

23:54.397 --> 23:56.980
- Yeah.
- Well, that's because Mom and Dad

23:56.982 --> 23:58.870
and I were up having
really fun magic parties.

23:58.871 --> 24:01.587
I always knew you guys were
doing awesome stuff without me.

24:01.590 --> 24:02.913
We were.

24:02.915 --> 24:05.365
They also paid me 100 bucks
for every trick I learned.

24:05.367 --> 24:06.982
Okay. You're joking.

24:06.984 --> 24:09.576
- No, I'm not.
- Mm-hmm. You're joking.

24:09.577 --> 24:11.528
Come on, Nina's got
something for us.

24:11.530 --> 24:14.526
- Seriously, you're joking, right?
- No.

24:14.527 --> 24:17.220
<i>What do you mean?
You are joking about that.</i>

24:17.222 --> 24:20.081
Okay, what do we got?

24:20.084 --> 24:22.877
Three unsolved gem thefts
in the Chicago area.

24:22.879 --> 24:25.133
<i>All private residences
in wealthy suburbs.</i>

24:25.134 --> 24:26.714
No arrests were made.

24:26.716 --> 24:28.870
Jadeite and musgravite in Glencoe,

24:28.872 --> 24:31.470
<i>painite in Lake Forest,</i>

24:31.473 --> 24:33.661
<i>and your blue benitoite
in Highland Park.</i>

24:33.663 --> 24:37.218
Okay, whoever Donna is working for
has to have his hand in all of these.

24:37.221 --> 24:39.373
Did the Chicago departments
connect these robberies?

24:39.375 --> 24:40.912
No, but I called and let them know.

24:40.914 --> 24:46.318
- Maybe it's not just Chicago.
- You think he hit other cities?

24:46.321 --> 24:49.912
Well, he's got Donna in Chicago,
Banyan in Boston.

24:49.913 --> 24:53.503
- I'll widen the search nationwide.
- Okay.

24:53.505 --> 24:57.438
- I know.
- Well, it's just so... bright.

24:57.441 --> 25:00.038
I think my pupils are still adjusting.

25:00.039 --> 25:02.227
It's citrine.

25:02.229 --> 25:05.135
You know, technically I think
that's a jewel tone.

25:05.137 --> 25:09.891
You know, technically I
think you're Ma's daughter.

25:09.894 --> 25:11.260
Here we go.

25:14.205 --> 25:16.769
Wow. Five more cities.

25:16.770 --> 25:18.102
Total of eight more places.

25:18.104 --> 25:19.951
We're gonna need case files
for all of them.

25:19.953 --> 25:23.575
And 2 1/2 more weeks to go through them.

25:28.895 --> 25:31.357
We talked to cops on all eight
other gem thefts.

25:31.359 --> 25:33.410
The pattern's the same as our victim's.

25:33.412 --> 25:36.009
In every case, the thieves
stole distinctive stones

25:36.012 --> 25:37.413
from wealthy gem collectors,

25:37.415 --> 25:40.011
and they all got through
high-end security systems.

25:40.014 --> 25:42.305
Canton, Ohio, was the only
other case besides ours

25:42.306 --> 25:44.083
where the victims were home.

25:44.086 --> 25:47.232
They were also murdered.
Amy and Sam Reichart.

25:47.234 --> 25:50.823
Eight thefts with two
additional murders.

25:50.824 --> 25:52.808
How did we not see this
two years ago?

25:52.811 --> 25:54.039
Well, we had no reason to look for it.

25:54.041 --> 25:55.169
They were all out
of our jurisdiction,

25:55.171 --> 25:56.673
and we had an open and shut case.

25:56.676 --> 26:00.184
The Cleveland cops are calling the case
"the Houdini whodunit."

26:00.220 --> 26:01.258
And why's that?

26:01.261 --> 26:04.133
Because they have no idea how
the thieves got in or out.

26:04.134 --> 26:05.740
What about the other locations?

26:05.741 --> 26:08.648
Entry point was unclear for all
the other cases, except for Canton.

26:08.649 --> 26:09.982
The front door was open.

26:09.985 --> 26:11.864
So, we have no idea
how they got in or out,

26:11.866 --> 26:13.644
but they left the door open
in the homes

26:13.646 --> 26:15.447
where they murdered someone?

26:16.417 --> 26:18.530
What if Banyan was already
in the house

26:18.533 --> 26:19.941
when the Hammonds got home?

26:19.943 --> 26:21.452
And killing them is what forced
him to leave through a door?

26:21.454 --> 26:24.207
Exactly.
He deviated from his original plan.

26:24.209 --> 26:26.893
- Which was what?
- Go out the same way he came in.

26:26.896 --> 26:27.968
Which was how?

26:27.971 --> 26:30.688
I don't know,
but the evidence warehouse,

26:30.691 --> 26:32.167
they came in through the vent,

26:32.169 --> 26:34.805
so maybe there's something
we missed.

26:43.555 --> 26:46.576
- Kent!
- Oh.

26:46.577 --> 26:49.228
And your friend.
Still here.

26:49.230 --> 26:52.084
Yeah.

26:52.085 --> 26:53.897
Rihanna and I have just
been out shopping.

26:53.900 --> 26:58.162
- Rihanna?
- Oh, yeah, the Queen of Barbados.

26:58.164 --> 27:00.546
That's the reason I got some bling.

27:01.825 --> 27:03.436
Well, I got something for you, too.

27:03.437 --> 27:07.064
- Does it sparkle?
- Ha, ha, very funny.

27:07.066 --> 27:08.709
It's a new restorative yoga clinic

27:08.711 --> 27:10.724
that's opened up next door
to the pet store.

27:10.725 --> 27:11.799
Oh.

27:11.800 --> 27:14.552
Yeah, Rihanna was feeling so much
better after a little exercise,

27:14.555 --> 27:16.367
I thought that maybe you
could... you know.

27:16.368 --> 27:19.423
Thank you.
I'll check it out.

27:19.425 --> 27:21.471
So, does this mean
she's fully recovered?

27:21.474 --> 27:25.165
Yeah. Better than ever,
aren't you, Rihanna?

27:26.679 --> 27:29.231
Aww.
Well, you know what this means.

27:29.232 --> 27:32.355
Yep.
I am the duck whisperer.

27:32.357 --> 27:34.571
"A" ... you need more
human friends.

27:34.573 --> 27:36.654
And "B" ...
she's ready to go home.

27:37.428 --> 27:40.616
Yeah...
I guess you're right.

27:40.619 --> 27:43.572
I guess I just got a
little bit attached.

27:43.574 --> 27:45.218
Oh, I know it's hard.

27:45.220 --> 27:47.837
But sooner or later,
you have to let go.

27:47.840 --> 27:50.322
Mm.

27:50.324 --> 27:52.708
Bye, Rihanna.

27:56.773 --> 27:59.560
What does she know?

27:59.562 --> 28:01.547
Exactly. That's what I thought.
Come on.

28:08.662 --> 28:11.313
- Hey, Nina!
- Angela.

28:11.316 --> 28:13.802
Hi. Jane and Frankie are out
on a case.

28:13.804 --> 28:15.859
Oh, that's okay.
I was just bringing in

28:15.860 --> 28:18.877
- some reinforcements for everybody.
- Ah, thank you.

28:18.879 --> 28:20.601
We ran right through the last batch.

28:20.603 --> 28:22.955
- Italian is my favorite.
- Is that right?

28:22.958 --> 28:24.615
<i>Frankie's been teaching me to cook.</i>

28:24.616 --> 28:28.562
- We did chicken parm last week.
- Well...

28:28.563 --> 28:32.509
- that's a first.
- Is that right?

28:32.510 --> 28:34.863
Well, he only cooks for me
on Mother's Day.

28:34.866 --> 28:36.820
Maybe I'll get him
to work on that.

28:36.821 --> 28:40.568
You two seem to have a lot
in common, don't you?

28:40.570 --> 28:44.249
Well, we have a few differences.
I love the opera.

28:44.251 --> 28:48.432
Oh, opera, no.
He was brought up on Motown.

28:48.434 --> 28:51.044
No way!
Well, that would explain

28:51.046 --> 28:53.621
<i>why I could never get him
to a show with me.</i>

28:53.622 --> 28:55.293
Yeah, he'd much rather be
at any game, any sport.

28:55.296 --> 28:57.805
- He can have them.
- Oh, tell me about it.

28:57.807 --> 29:01.184
Frankie Sr. used to get us
Bruins tickets.

29:01.186 --> 29:03.862
<i>Front row, blue line.</i>

29:03.864 --> 29:06.740
Anybody who got checked
into the boards,

29:06.742 --> 29:09.820
Frankie would cheer!
I would scream.

29:09.822 --> 29:12.196
You had front-row tickets?

29:12.197 --> 29:17.215
Well, his father used to say,
"I know a guy who knows a guy."

29:18.858 --> 29:22.336
- Can I tell you a little secret?
- Okay.

29:22.339 --> 29:24.779
I don't think Frankie will ever
be as good of a cook as you.

29:24.781 --> 29:28.193
- Does he think he will be?
- He thinks he's close.

29:28.195 --> 29:32.410
Well, other than a healthy sense
of delusion,

29:32.411 --> 29:35.589
- he's a great son.
- Yeah.

29:35.591 --> 29:38.132
He really is a great guy.

29:54.032 --> 29:58.447
I haven't been back here
since Mom and Dad were...

29:59.521 --> 30:00.622
Hey, Tessa.

30:00.624 --> 30:02.162
Why don't you go back
to your aunt's house.

30:02.164 --> 30:05.040
Okay? We can lock up
when we're done.

30:10.229 --> 30:14.344
- I really wanted to help.
- And you have.

30:14.345 --> 30:16.051
<i>Detective Rizzoli's
in the squad car outside.</i>

30:16.052 --> 30:17.490
<i>Why don't you let him
take you home.</i>

30:17.492 --> 30:20.903
Okay.
Thank you.

30:35.164 --> 30:37.906
There's the A/C vent.

30:37.907 --> 30:40.182
That can't be more than
10 inches wide.

30:40.183 --> 30:43.294
- Nobody getting through there.
- No.

30:43.296 --> 30:45.302
All right, let's search the rest
of the house.

30:45.303 --> 30:48.448
- Hey, court's first thing tomorrow.
- Did you see her face?

30:48.449 --> 30:50.141
We can't leave
until we find something

30:50.142 --> 30:52.277
that keeps that bastard in jail.

31:36.372 --> 31:38.978
<i>Korsak!</i>

31:38.980 --> 31:41.422
Look at this.

31:50.900 --> 31:53.506
<i>The frame's a little scratched,</i>

31:53.507 --> 31:56.445
but there doesn't seem to be any
other signs of tampering.

31:56.447 --> 31:58.756
All the screws are intact.

31:58.758 --> 32:01.595
Well... Thanks.
...his buddy was meticulous.

32:01.597 --> 32:05.591
So he could've had him just replace
everything as he went.

32:05.592 --> 32:10.048
- Except look here.
- The sheathing's sticking out.

32:10.050 --> 32:11.731
Right, so if the seal was broken,

32:11.734 --> 32:14.076
that would explain the
condensation on the table,

32:14.078 --> 32:15.331
the water mark on the rug.

32:15.333 --> 32:17.526
When we photographed the
crime scene, they wouldn't have

32:17.528 --> 32:19.721
been here, but two years of
rain and snow, there you go.

32:19.723 --> 32:21.535
I just got off the phone with Nina.

32:21.537 --> 32:23.626
All the other robbery sites
had skylights.

32:23.628 --> 32:25.298
And they're not usually
meant to be open,

32:25.301 --> 32:27.251
so they wouldn't be wired
to the security system.

32:27.253 --> 32:30.004
Hey, guys, I know I've not been
to the gym in a while, but...

32:30.005 --> 32:33.413
there's no way one man could've
lifted that down on his own.

32:33.415 --> 32:35.997
No, you're right.
Somebody was here with him.

32:35.998 --> 32:38.082
Banyan and his partner
pulled this job together.

32:38.084 --> 32:41.159
Whose blood is that?

32:41.856 --> 32:46.291
- You' sure that's blood?
- It's a little eroded and oxidized, but yeah.

32:46.293 --> 32:48.509
We always thought that Banyan
cut his hand on a knife

32:48.511 --> 32:50.859
on the cutting board ...
he could've done it right there.

32:50.860 --> 32:52.879
If that's Banyan's blood,
we can lock him up for good.

32:52.881 --> 32:54.094
If it's his partner's blood,

32:54.096 --> 32:55.751
he could walk out of
the courthouse today.

32:55.754 --> 32:57.668
How long's it take to get DNA results?

32:57.670 --> 33:00.505
As soon as we get a swab to
the lab, best bet's an hour.

33:00.506 --> 33:02.753
It's 8:02.
Court starts at 9:00.

33:02.755 --> 33:05.036
That's cutting it close.

33:06.217 --> 33:08.758
Hi, this is Detective Jane Rizzoli.

33:08.761 --> 33:11.375
I need to speak to
the District Attorney, please.

33:11.377 --> 33:14.653
Yes, immediately.
Thank you.

33:20.423 --> 33:23.331
Are the people seriously
standing before me

33:23.332 --> 33:25.172
asking for another continuance?

33:25.175 --> 33:27.420
Your Honor, if I may,
the police department

33:27.421 --> 33:29.079
just needs a little more time.

33:29.081 --> 33:32.430
This is outrageous, Your Honor.
We had a deal.

33:35.642 --> 33:36.629
Sorry, Sergeant.

33:36.631 --> 33:39.472
<i>Ms. Stanwick,
Mr. Dayton is correct.</i>

33:39.475 --> 33:40.956
<i>Defense's motion is granted.</i>

33:40.958 --> 33:43.306
This case is hereby dismissed
without prejudice.

33:44.420 --> 33:46.406
Mr. Banyan, you're free to go.

34:07.738 --> 34:09.824
What the hell's going on here?

34:09.827 --> 34:12.049
<i>My client would like to go home.</i>

34:12.051 --> 34:13.902
I thought I was a free man.

34:13.904 --> 34:17.574
- Yeah, we wanted you to think that.
- Mr. Banyan had a partner.

34:17.578 --> 34:20.101
He orchestrated multiple
robbery-homicides across the country.

34:20.103 --> 34:22.158
And he had Donna Marks break

34:22.159 --> 34:25.391
into the evidence warehouse
and destroy the cutting board.

34:25.395 --> 34:27.685
Okay, well, who is
this mystery partner?

34:27.687 --> 34:29.059
That's what we need to know.

34:29.061 --> 34:30.534
And we needed you
to look like a free man

34:30.536 --> 34:31.812
so we could draw your partner out.

34:31.813 --> 34:35.188
- My charges have been dismissed.
- About that.

34:35.190 --> 34:37.382
We found new evidence that'll
put you away for good.

34:37.384 --> 34:40.199
You left a little DNA on the skylight
at the Hammonds' house.

34:40.203 --> 34:42.429
Well, you can't charge me again.
That's double jeopardy.

34:42.429 --> 34:43.935
I dismissed the case
without prejudice.

34:43.937 --> 34:46.893
Which means I can re-file
charges any time.

34:47.443 --> 34:48.817
If you tell us who this guy is,

34:48.819 --> 34:50.750
the D.A. will consider
the possibility of parole

34:50.752 --> 34:54.170
- on your life sentence.
- Come on, Steve. We get it.

34:54.172 --> 34:56.753
You kept your mouth shut 'cause
he said he would get you out.

34:56.755 --> 34:58.664
He's not gonna destroy
your evidence twice.

34:58.666 --> 35:02.152
<i>We will get him
with or without you,</i>

35:02.154 --> 35:03.627
so you have only one choice,

35:03.628 --> 35:07.109
and that's if you ever want
to see a sunset again.

35:24.922 --> 35:27.299
I told you I'd come through for you.

35:27.302 --> 35:30.083
I told you I'd keep my mouth shut.

35:30.085 --> 35:33.134
Check the trunk.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.111
Boston police!
Get out of the car!

35:47.421 --> 35:49.127
Now, now, now!

35:49.498 --> 35:51.810
<i>Shit!</i>

35:55.703 --> 35:58.383
<i>- Boston P.D.!
- Freeze!</i>

36:02.643 --> 36:03.948
Stay down!

36:03.950 --> 36:06.866
Stay down! Stay down!
Don't move.

36:06.868 --> 36:08.721
<i>Hands behind your back.</i>

36:16.418 --> 36:19.668
<i>♪ Bye, bye love ♪</i>

36:19.670 --> 36:22.317
<i>♪ Bye, bye happiness ♪</i>

36:22.319 --> 36:24.899

36:24.901 --> 36:27.447
<i>♪ I think I'm gonna cry ♪</i>

36:27.449 --> 36:29.224
You want to come talk about it?

36:29.226 --> 36:31.873
<i>♪ Bye, bye love ♪</i>

36:31.875 --> 36:33.047
<i>♪ Bye, bye... ♪</i>

36:33.291 --> 36:35.536
- I'm fine.
- I've got wine.

36:35.538 --> 36:38.721
Oh, well, that changes
everything, then, doesn't it?

36:38.723 --> 36:41.468
Take a seat.

36:45.121 --> 36:47.965
I don't know why I feel like
this over a silly duck.

36:47.966 --> 36:49.875
An adorable duck.

36:49.877 --> 36:52.118
When I put her back in the pond,
she just swam away,

36:52.120 --> 36:53.893
not even so much
as a "thank you" quack.

36:53.895 --> 36:57.712
- You think you know someone.
- Well, that's right.

36:57.714 --> 36:58.851
Make fun of me, why don't you?

36:58.853 --> 37:00.693
I was just trying to make you laugh.

37:00.695 --> 37:02.936
Well, this'll definitely help.

37:02.938 --> 37:05.416
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

37:07.661 --> 37:11.780
- Ahh.
- Well, I think you should be proud

37:11.782 --> 37:13.622
that you got the duck
healthy enough to go home.

37:13.624 --> 37:17.439
Mm.
I just hope the duck thinks so.

37:17.441 --> 37:20.689
I know it sounds ridiculous, but...

37:20.691 --> 37:24.675
it just hurts to think that
she doesn't need me anymore.

37:24.677 --> 37:29.463
When she swam away, I...
I even called out her name.

37:29.465 --> 37:31.405
Not so much as a look back.

37:31.407 --> 37:34.966
She may not have responded
because she was actually a he.

37:34.968 --> 37:38.192
What are you talking about?
Female mallards are brown.

37:38.194 --> 37:40.754
So are males this time of year.
They're in molt.

37:40.756 --> 37:44.717
They only sprout colorful
plumage during mating season.

37:46.045 --> 37:47.683
Oh.

37:51.865 --> 37:55.984
Let me say what Rihanna should have.

37:56.422 --> 38:00.746
Thank you for helping her get
through this really awful time.

38:00.748 --> 38:03.672
<i>She couldn't have gotten
through it without you.</i>

38:03.674 --> 38:06.966
You took wonderful care of her.

38:06.968 --> 38:10.880
And she should've told you sooner.

38:13.421 --> 38:16.679
Rihanna does seem
a little bit ridiculous now

38:16.681 --> 38:18.375
in the light of things.

38:18.377 --> 38:20.638
Thank you... for saying that.

38:22.202 --> 38:24.196
I think the duck
would've also added

38:24.198 --> 38:27.024
- that I'm a very handsome chap.
- Yeah, don't push it.

38:37.238 --> 38:39.265
<i>Hey.</i>

38:39.267 --> 38:41.328
You're starting
to look like Grandma

38:41.329 --> 38:43.191
with those bags under your eyes.

38:43.193 --> 38:45.819
I'm too tired to be insulted.

38:45.821 --> 38:50.376
And tonight...
I sleep for a week.

38:50.378 --> 38:54.367
I think the record for sleep
deprivation is about 19 days.

38:54.369 --> 38:56.129
Hold up.
This is something

38:56.131 --> 38:59.057
that you don't know
the exact factoid on?

38:59.059 --> 39:02.084
Wow, maybe the both of you
are sleep deprived.

39:02.086 --> 39:04.246
Well, the "Guinness Book
of World Records"

39:04.249 --> 39:07.141
no longer keeps statistics
on this subject for fear that

39:07.143 --> 39:10.034
those competing for the title
would suffer ill effects.

39:10.036 --> 39:13.128
Sometimes I think
you're actually a robot.

39:13.130 --> 39:16.421
I do know how to do the robot.

39:16.623 --> 39:20.079
- No, you don't.
- Yeah, I do. You taught me.

39:20.081 --> 39:21.343
Not like that.

39:21.345 --> 39:23.840
- Like this?
- No. You're hurting me.

39:25.006 --> 39:27.198
- I have a little surprise for you.
- Yeah?

39:27.200 --> 39:30.027
So, your mom was telling me
how much you love the Bruins.

39:30.029 --> 39:33.785
Oh, of course.
Oh!

39:33.787 --> 39:36.213
Bruins tickets? Front row?
How did you get these?

39:36.215 --> 39:37.744
Oh, I know a guy
who knows a guy.

39:37.746 --> 39:42.434
<i>Well, thank you. I have a
little surprise for you, too.</i>

39:42.436 --> 39:44.395
Oh. Okay.

39:44.397 --> 39:46.458
You got something right there.
Oh, what's that?

39:46.460 --> 39:47.793
It's a coin.

39:47.795 --> 39:49.028
Look. Boom.

39:49.030 --> 39:53.200
Aww. Look at him.
He's putting on a show for her.

39:53.202 --> 39:55.737
Does that mean that
they're getting serious?

39:55.739 --> 39:57.371
Oh, definitely.

39:57.373 --> 39:59.540
Yeah, Ma, 'cause it goes first base,

39:59.542 --> 40:04.012
- second base, third base, magic tricks.
- Stop!

40:04.014 --> 40:07.350
- Ugh, and he's the worst magician.
- Now I'm gonna need you to hold out your hand.

40:07.352 --> 40:10.087
<i>- Okay.
- Now, all right,  now make a fist.</i>

40:10.089 --> 40:11.822
<i>Okay.</i>

40:11.824 --> 40:13.858
<i>- Here it comes.
- Okay.</i>

40:13.860 --> 40:16.728
- Okay, here we go. Ready?
- Mm-hmm.

40:16.729 --> 40:20.432
- Okay, open your hand.
- Oh!

40:20.433 --> 40:23.003
- Hey! You did it!
- Uh-huh.

40:23.005 --> 40:24.170
You're the Fabulous Frankie!

40:24.172 --> 40:28.441
Well, I learned everything I know
from the... Jazzy Jane.

40:28.444 --> 40:29.977
- Is that right?
- Mm-hmm.

40:29.979 --> 40:32.280
- How did you learn, Jane?
- Well, she won't tell me.

40:32.281 --> 40:35.150
I learned from my high-school
boyfriend, Johnny.

40:35.152 --> 40:36.985
- Was he cute?
- Mm.

40:36.987 --> 40:39.921
- Oh.
- Very cute.

40:39.923 --> 40:41.457
You showed me his photo.

40:41.459 --> 40:43.492
It was the two of
you at the beach, remember?

40:43.495 --> 40:45.228
It doesn't look like
he has any clothes.

40:45.230 --> 40:47.431
- Oh!
- Oh!

40:47.433 --> 40:49.433
- Really?
- No.

40:51.537 --> 40:53.003
So, whatever happened to Johnny?

40:53.006 --> 40:57.710
- He pulled a real disappearing act.
- Did you say...

40:57.712 --> 41:00.846
- disappearing act?
- No, I did not.

41:00.848 --> 41:02.115
Oh, I think I know that trick.

41:02.117 --> 41:04.684
- No. You really don't.
- Hold this for me, please.

41:04.686 --> 41:08.689
- Okay.
- Okay.

41:08.692 --> 41:11.091
- Now you see me.
- Uh-huh?

41:11.093 --> 41:12.326
And now...

41:12.328 --> 41:15.030
Whoo!

41:15.032 --> 41:17.829
- ...you ... you still see me.
- Yeah.

41:17.864 --> 41:18.968
<i>You see, there was supposed
to be more smoke.</i>

41:18.970 --> 41:21.970
So, what, so you could, like,
run out the door and disappear?

41:21.973 --> 41:24.007
I mean, it's not like there's
a trap door here.

41:24.009 --> 41:25.308
- Okay, fine, you know what?
- Hmm?

41:25.311 --> 41:26.744
- Do it again.
- Okay.

41:26.746 --> 41:29.179
This time, really run out
the back door and disappear,

41:29.181 --> 41:32.550
- and Nina, tickets.
- No, you will not take these tickets.

41:32.553 --> 41:34.385
No, we're ... you're not gonna
take these tickets.

41:34.388 --> 41:36.533
- Please do the trick again.
- I'm not gonna do the ...

41:36.536 --> 41:41.778
You're so good at it.
Please?
