WEBVTT

00:07.607 --> 00:09.842
Hey-- ooh.

00:09.844 --> 00:13.278
Did you play your last game
of basketball under a car?

00:15.181 --> 00:17.483
Your blouse is, um,
filthy, maddie.

00:17.485 --> 00:19.351
First of all,
it's not a blouse.

00:19.353 --> 00:20.919
It's my jersey,
and by jersey I mean

00:20.921 --> 00:23.589
Halloween costume.
Bam!  Boo!

00:23.591 --> 00:25.224
( laughs )

00:25.226 --> 00:26.759
( chuckles )

00:26.761 --> 00:29.328
Okay, so Halloween is
the one night of the year

00:29.330 --> 00:30.696
That you can go
as whatever you want,

00:30.698 --> 00:32.431
And you chose
a basketball player.

00:32.433 --> 00:33.565
No.

00:33.567 --> 00:36.935
A dead basketball player!
( laughs )

00:36.937 --> 00:39.671
Yeah, willow and I are going
to screamfest as team death.

00:39.673 --> 00:40.939
Oh, speaking
of screamfest.

00:40.941 --> 00:42.808
So, I have been thinking
about the theme--

00:42.810 --> 00:45.878
No, liv,
when you say "thinking,"
you mean "changing,"

00:45.880 --> 00:47.880
And these details
have been locked.

00:47.882 --> 00:52.451
Right, um, I just think
that death has been kind of...

00:52.453 --> 00:53.952
You know,
done to death.

00:53.954 --> 00:56.355
And as your new
screamfest co-chair,

00:56.357 --> 00:58.290
I have come up
with a new theme,

00:58.292 --> 00:59.892
So you might want to sit down
so you can rise to applaud me.

00:59.894 --> 01:01.994
It's gonna be
more dramatic.

01:03.696 --> 01:05.731
No?  Okay.
So...

01:05.733 --> 01:08.700
I have come up with a theme
that is so fright-tacular,

01:08.702 --> 01:12.271
So scare-diculous,
that screamfest will
never be the same again.

01:12.273 --> 01:13.338
Are you ready?

01:13.340 --> 01:15.607
The theme is...

01:15.609 --> 01:17.810
Brown!
( gasps )

01:20.281 --> 01:23.615
That's not a theme,
that's a carpet color.

01:23.617 --> 01:24.917
Well, we might as well
make the theme

01:24.919 --> 01:26.785
I-- uh-- turtle necks.

01:26.787 --> 01:30.522
You know what?  We should
dog-ear that for next year.

01:31.825 --> 01:33.358
Liv, I'm being serious.

01:33.360 --> 01:35.294
Screamfest is supposed
to be scary.

01:35.296 --> 01:36.528
And it will be.

01:36.530 --> 01:38.430
I mean, no one
looks good in brown.

01:39.999 --> 01:41.767
All right, come here.

01:41.769 --> 01:43.902
Look me in the eyes.
I'm going to even say this

01:43.904 --> 01:46.472
In slow motion so that it can
really sink in, yeah?

01:47.707 --> 01:50.709
No-o-o-o-o-o.

01:53.580 --> 01:56.615
Great, so you're gonna
think about it.

Your child
peacefully
sleeping,

02:59.980 --> 03:02.581
Trying to rest
her growing
teenage body?

03:03.650 --> 03:04.950
I haven't had
a nap since you
were born,

03:04.952 --> 03:06.752
So too bad,
so sad.

03:06.754 --> 03:09.121
Mmm!
I remember this.

03:09.123 --> 03:11.023
This is from
my old Halloween
costume, right?

03:11.025 --> 03:12.457
Mm-hmm, you were six.

03:12.459 --> 03:14.026
You and liv were wizards...

03:14.028 --> 03:16.695
And joey was
a kitten being
eaten by a shark.

03:16.697 --> 03:17.829
( laughing )

03:17.831 --> 03:20.032
Things went
wrong so young
for that boy.

03:21.067 --> 03:23.669
Yeah, and liv fought me so hard

03:23.671 --> 03:24.903
For this because she was
convinced

03:24.905 --> 03:27.105
That it had magical powers.
( laughs )

03:27.107 --> 03:30.542
Okay, it does
have magical powers.

03:30.544 --> 03:32.044
I mean, maddie wished
to be a great basketball player

03:32.046 --> 03:33.912
And I wished to be famous.
So...

( chuckles )

03:36.684 --> 03:40.152
Man, I love Halloween.

03:40.154 --> 03:43.088
Not nearly as much though
as I love walking around

03:43.090 --> 03:44.990
- Without my knee brace.
- ( laughs )

03:44.992 --> 03:46.992
Now that your knee's
so strong,

03:46.994 --> 03:49.595
Our hypnotherapy sessions
will get your mental edge back

03:49.597 --> 03:51.496
In a snap.
( snaps fingers )

03:51.498 --> 03:53.765
That's so weird.
( chuckles )

03:53.767 --> 03:55.601
When you snapped just now,
I had this sudden urge

03:55.603 --> 03:57.069
To go clean
the entire kitchen.

03:58.071 --> 03:59.071
Huh.

03:59.073 --> 04:01.773
I wonder where
that came from.

04:04.043 --> 04:06.111

04:10.149 --> 04:13.819
Mother, father,
we're so happy to see you.

04:13.821 --> 04:15.954
Have you been
working out, dad?

04:15.956 --> 04:17.456
Show me the guns.

04:18.424 --> 04:20.192
Bang!  Bang!

04:20.194 --> 04:23.462
Whoa, papa got swole.

04:23.464 --> 04:25.464
Okay, holster
the guns, pete.

04:25.466 --> 04:27.065
This much butt-smoochery
can only mean

04:27.067 --> 04:28.767
That they want
something.

04:29.902 --> 04:31.670
Still feels nice.

04:33.072 --> 04:35.474
So... We were wondering--

04:35.476 --> 04:37.142
Spill it
so we can kill it.

04:39.112 --> 04:41.113
We want to go
to mutilator mike's
haunted house

04:41.115 --> 04:43.482
Of terrifying frights
and scares.

04:43.484 --> 04:45.884
There's a mad scientist,
he clones himself

04:45.886 --> 04:48.954
But the clones turn on him,
unscrew the top of his skull,

04:48.956 --> 04:50.922
And eat his brains
like a bowl of cereal.

04:52.492 --> 04:54.993
But the brains are rotted,
so there's squirming maggots--

04:54.995 --> 04:56.962
( clears throat )
you're not going.

04:56.964 --> 04:59.131
Guys, we discussed this.

04:59.133 --> 05:02.067
Mutilator mike's
is not age-appropriate.

05:02.069 --> 05:04.503
How is it not
age-appropriate for me?

05:04.505 --> 05:06.705
I am in my prime
maggot years.

05:07.874 --> 05:10.208
The movie "pony princess"
gave you nightmares.

05:10.210 --> 05:14.012
It was a horse in a dress,
mother, can you blame me?

05:16.015 --> 05:17.516
Come on, mom.

05:17.518 --> 05:19.518
Isn't there any way
we could go?

05:19.520 --> 05:20.952
Yeah, well, you know,
there might be one way.

05:20.954 --> 05:21.987
- ( gasps )
- what is it?  What is it?

05:21.989 --> 05:23.121
You could clone yourselves

05:23.123 --> 05:24.122
And we'd never know you left.

05:24.124 --> 05:26.858
- ( laughing )
- hey-y!

05:26.860 --> 05:28.994
How cruel can you be?

05:28.996 --> 05:33.065
You know I'm still
five years from mastering
cloning technology.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.119
Who is too old
to be trick-or-treating.

You're supposed to be
in your team death jersey.

06:07.067 --> 06:09.234
It's my brown costume.

06:09.236 --> 06:11.002
Liv texted the whole school
and said you guys decided

06:11.004 --> 06:13.572
To change the theme.
Go big and go brown!

06:13.574 --> 06:15.207
Go home

- Yeah.

10:04.036 --> 10:06.037
Helga:
<i>Helga jumps!</i>
<i>( thuds )</i>

10:06.039 --> 10:07.072
<i>( chains rattle )</i>

10:07.074 --> 10:08.473
Liv:
<i>Double owsies.</i>

10:10.009 --> 10:11.409
( growl )

10:13.346 --> 10:16.114
Helga:
Helga is ready.
We go now!

10:16.116 --> 10:17.983
-  <i>( underwear stretches )</i>
<i>- oh!  Ooh!</i>

10:17.985 --> 10:20.151
Wow!  Okay.

10:20.153 --> 10:21.987
Helga wedgie,
I guess I go now.

10:21.989 --> 10:24.155
Ooh, I go now.
( groans )

10:24.157 --> 10:26.925
A magic amulet?
( chuckles )

10:26.927 --> 10:28.860
A world without helga?

10:28.862 --> 10:31.262
Well, maddie's
finally lost it.

10:31.264 --> 10:33.264
I know, right?

10:35.134 --> 10:38.269
Hey, magic amulet, I wish
we had clones of ourselves

10:38.271 --> 10:40.271
So we could go
to mutilator mike's.

10:40.273 --> 10:42.340
- Ooh.
-  <i>( ominous tone )</i>

10:42.342 --> 10:44.342
( both gasp )

10:44.344 --> 10:45.510
Witchcraft!

10:45.512 --> 10:47.379
( splash )

10:47.381 --> 10:50.849
Ugh, nice job, munch.

10:50.851 --> 10:53.251
If that thing had
any shot of being magic,

10:53.253 --> 10:55.120
It's ruined now.

10:55.122 --> 10:57.155
Dude, relax.

10:57.157 --> 10:59.524
We'll rinse it off.

10:59.526 --> 11:03.461
For the record, hummus does not
shield magical powers.

11:04.530 --> 11:05.964
Hey, you don't know that.

11:05.966 --> 11:08.199
Hummus is a very
powerful spread.

11:14.106 --> 11:16.608
( grunts ) whoo!

11:18.411 --> 11:20.145
Both: Whoa.

11:21.580 --> 11:23.148
( british accent )
cheerio, mates.

11:23.150 --> 11:26.251
The name's plus.
Parker plus.

11:27.353 --> 11:29.187
Come along then, ooey.
Chop chop.

11:29.189 --> 11:31.256
( panting, giggling )

11:36.062 --> 11:37.395
Both:
We have clones!

11:37.397 --> 11:40.231
We have clones!
We have clones!

11:40.233 --> 11:44.202
Wow, the amulet
really was magic.

11:44.204 --> 11:45.904
Ooey, ooey, ooey.

11:48.174 --> 11:49.908
Ooey.

11:49.910 --> 11:51.276
Ooey.

11:51.278 --> 11:54.045
Ooey says it's jolly good
to meet you blokes,

11:54.047 --> 11:56.281
And he has an itch.

11:57.483 --> 11:59.884
( sighs )
ooey.

11:59.886 --> 12:01.086
He found the spot.

12:02.021 --> 12:05.356
Okay, is it just me
or is my clone...

12:05.358 --> 12:08.326
Like, the coolest guy ever?

12:10.930 --> 12:12.664
Ooey.
( chuckles )

12:13.966 --> 12:15.166
It's just you.

12:16.268 --> 12:18.403
Ooey, ooey.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.271
Ooey.
( whimpers )

12:20.273 --> 12:23.074
The poor lad says he was
starting to take form

12:23.076 --> 12:24.609
When something
went wonky.

12:24.611 --> 12:27.145
Like the magic
was shielded somehow.

12:27.147 --> 12:28.613
See?

12:28.615 --> 12:30.982
Told you--
hummus!

12:33.252 --> 12:35.153
I don't care
what happened to him.

12:35.155 --> 12:36.654
I love him
just the way he is.

12:38.124 --> 12:40.291
Hi, little fella.

12:40.293 --> 12:41.426
Ooey.

12:42.595 --> 12:43.962
Okay, here's the deal:

12:43.964 --> 12:45.463
We are going
to a haunted house.

12:45.465 --> 12:48.066
You two are staying here
to distract our parents.

12:48.068 --> 12:50.235
Yeah, yeah, and if they ask
any questions,

12:50.237 --> 12:52.303
Your tux is
your Halloween costume.

12:52.305 --> 12:56.040
Tell them you're going
as parker with class.

12:56.042 --> 12:57.208
And you're going as...

13:01.480 --> 13:03.448
Eh, they probably won't
notice the difference.

13:10.089 --> 13:12.157
<i>( ominous music playing )</i>

13:15.661 --> 13:18.530
- ( gong chimes )
- helga is near!

13:18.532 --> 13:21.166
Do not run
or we will hunt you down

13:21.168 --> 13:24.202
And you will wind up
like our math teacher,

13:24.204 --> 13:26.437
Mr. Cove!

13:28.107 --> 13:30.508
He gave helga a "c"!

13:30.510 --> 13:31.976
( gasping )

13:35.181 --> 13:37.015
- ( gasps )
- ( gong chimes )

13:37.017 --> 13:38.049
She arrives!

13:38.051 --> 13:40.151
All hail helga!

13:40.153 --> 13:42.520
- All hail helga!
- Students: All hail helga!

13:42.522 --> 13:45.156
- Willow:  <i>All hail helga!</i>
<i>- Students: </i> <i>All hail helga!</i>

13:45.158 --> 13:47.225
( chanting continues )

13:51.630 --> 13:54.499
Yeah, things have
definitely taken

13:54.501 --> 13:57.135
A little turn
for the crazy.

13:57.137 --> 14:02.073
Helga declares
helgafest open!

14:02.075 --> 14:03.641
( gong chimes )

14:05.511 --> 14:06.778
( sighs )

14:08.180 --> 14:10.248
( snarls )

14:16.488 --> 14:19.023
More fish for helga!

14:28.701 --> 14:31.502
Ooey, stop that.
I'm making us a spot of supper.

14:31.504 --> 14:33.238
Ooey, ooey, ooey.

14:35.074 --> 14:36.708
Ooh, parker,
you're cooking.

14:36.710 --> 14:38.276
How unusual.

14:38.278 --> 14:40.245
And joey, you're
licking a chicken.

14:41.213 --> 14:42.313
How joey.

14:43.582 --> 14:45.450
Ooey, ooey, ooey.

14:45.452 --> 14:47.318
Oh, I get it.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.254
That's your
Halloween costume

14:49.256 --> 14:51.256
You're gonna be talking
like that all night.

14:51.258 --> 14:53.491
No, that's not gonna
get annoying.

14:55.294 --> 14:57.428
So, what are you making?

14:57.430 --> 15:00.265
Well, the cupboards
are dreadfully bare,

15:00.267 --> 15:03.268
But I believe I can whip up
a lovely pot pie.

15:03.270 --> 15:04.302
Oh, heavens.

15:04.304 --> 15:06.170
We don't have any meat.

15:06.172 --> 15:07.538
I'm stymied.

15:09.742 --> 15:12.310
Oo-eey?

15:13.445 --> 15:15.146
Ooey, no,
that's ghastly.

15:16.181 --> 15:17.248
Ooey?

15:19.585 --> 15:21.552
Righty-o, they're not
really our mum and dad.

15:21.554 --> 15:23.521
Parent pot pie
it is.

15:27.359 --> 15:30.094
W-why are you
doing this?

15:30.096 --> 15:31.329
We're sorry.
Look-- look,

15:31.331 --> 15:33.231
You can go
to the haunted house.

15:34.667 --> 15:36.267
Simmer down,
mumsy.

15:37.303 --> 15:38.536
"simmer."

15:38.538 --> 15:40.538
Oh, I'm terrible.

15:44.143 --> 15:46.210
<i>( ominous music playing )</i>

15:51.750 --> 15:52.750
( gong chimes )

15:52.752 --> 15:54.385
Time's up, carvers.

15:54.387 --> 15:56.287
Reveal your work.

15:59.625 --> 16:00.692
Approved.

16:03.462 --> 16:05.463
( cackles )

16:07.132 --> 16:08.232
Approved.

16:10.903 --> 16:13.838
( demonic voice )
unacceptable!

16:19.545 --> 16:21.612
( gasping )

16:23.916 --> 16:25.750
Maddie,
what are you doing?

16:25.752 --> 16:27.318
Helga said to keep
our hoods on.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.220
Yeah, I am done
with helga.

16:29.222 --> 16:31.389
If giant skeleton
and wolf guy had a baby,

16:31.391 --> 16:32.924
They would not be
nearly as bad as her.

16:32.926 --> 16:34.659
( chuckles )

16:34.661 --> 16:36.627
Okay, well what are you
gonna do?  We're triplets.

16:36.629 --> 16:38.262
No, we're not.

16:38.264 --> 16:40.298
We're twins, and I know
that deep down inside

16:40.300 --> 16:41.466
Part of you
still knows that.

16:41.468 --> 16:42.934
I just, like,
really need you

16:42.936 --> 16:44.836
To go distract helga,
so that I can sneak out,

16:44.838 --> 16:46.704
Get the amulet
and save us.

16:46.706 --> 16:49.340
Okay, maddie, you are
making literally no sense,

16:49.342 --> 16:51.609
But if there is even
the tiniest chance

16:51.611 --> 16:53.478
That we can get rid
of helga, I'm in.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.847
I mean, I am done
sharing a bathroom with her.

16:55.849 --> 16:57.682
The litter box is there
for a reason, helga.

16:59.251 --> 17:00.318
Okay.

17:01.553 --> 17:03.287
Um, hey, helga!

17:04.890 --> 17:07.291
I think that this party
needs a diva moment.

17:07.293 --> 17:10.561
♪ helga-aa

17:10.563 --> 17:13.898
♪ is a big meanie, yow!

17:16.268 --> 17:18.970
Only helga
has diva moments!

17:18.972 --> 17:20.838
( demonic voice )
seize her!

17:22.641 --> 17:24.709
( chuckles )

17:26.678 --> 17:28.546
♪ helga-aa

17:28.548 --> 17:32.383
♪ is just misunderstood.

17:32.385 --> 17:33.885
Yow!

17:37.756 --> 17:39.490
Clap for helga!

17:41.260 --> 17:42.560
( demonic voice ) or die.

17:42.562 --> 17:44.629
- ( yelping )
- ( applause )

17:51.603 --> 17:53.971
The only thing
mutilator mike's mutilated,

17:53.973 --> 17:56.641
Was my love for Halloween.

17:56.643 --> 17:57.942
I know, right?

17:57.944 --> 18:01.913
I brought an extra pair
of underpants for nothing.

18:04.049 --> 18:05.283
What does a guy have to do

18:05.285 --> 18:07.452
To get a decent scare
around here?

18:07.454 --> 18:10.755
Karen:
Help, I'm being cooked alive!

18:13.025 --> 18:14.592
He-elp--

18:17.262 --> 18:18.830
( gasps )
evil clones!

18:18.832 --> 18:21.566
We made evil clones!

18:21.568 --> 18:24.001
I told you hummus
messes up magic!

18:25.838 --> 18:28.306
It is just so hard
watching your clones

18:28.308 --> 18:30.808
Grow up and make
bad choices.

18:31.743 --> 18:32.977
Snap out of it.

18:32.979 --> 18:35.413
Our selfish wish
is killing mom and dad.

18:35.415 --> 18:36.614
You're right.

18:36.616 --> 18:38.983
We must risk life
and limb to rescue them,

18:38.985 --> 18:40.985
And then tell them that
we have learned our lesson.

18:40.987 --> 18:44.689
Or we could get the amulet
and wish our clones away.

18:45.924 --> 18:48.493
Yeah, that sounds like
a shortcut I can get behind.

18:48.495 --> 18:49.660
( grunting )

18:49.662 --> 18:51.562
Stop struggling, mumsy,

18:51.564 --> 18:53.998
Or your muscles will flex
and make the meat chewy!

18:57.603 --> 18:58.970
Okay.

18:58.972 --> 19:00.338
Ooh.

19:02.641 --> 19:04.075
( sighs )
okay.

19:04.077 --> 19:05.343
I wish I was
a twin again.

19:05.345 --> 19:07.411
<i>( ominous tone )</i>

19:13.318 --> 19:14.719
Helga?

19:14.721 --> 19:16.654
<i>I-- no, 'cause I just</i>
<i>wished you away.</i>

19:16.656 --> 19:18.890
Where's liv?
Where's my twin sister?

19:18.892 --> 19:20.091
Who's liv?

19:20.093 --> 19:22.026
Helga's your twin sister.

19:24.029 --> 19:26.330
Give helga hug.

19:27.065 --> 19:29.066
Okay, you would think
I'd know by now

19:29.068 --> 19:32.103
To be incredibly specific
with that amulet.

19:33.805 --> 19:35.907
We need the magic
wish amulet.

19:35.909 --> 19:37.074
It's a matter
of life and mom.

19:37.076 --> 19:39.110
- And dad.
- Oh, yeah, him too.

19:42.981 --> 19:46.384
Seriously, munch?
The hummus again?

19:47.519 --> 19:48.719
Mmm...

19:48.721 --> 19:50.755
Helga loves hummus.

19:56.028 --> 19:57.061
- ( crunching )
- ( gasps )

19:57.063 --> 19:58.763
No!

19:58.765 --> 20:00.898
You destroyed the amulet,

20:00.900 --> 20:02.900
The only way to get
back to normal,

20:02.902 --> 20:05.069
And now we're stuck
this way forever.

20:05.071 --> 20:06.938
And you stuck
your dirty fish fingers

20:06.940 --> 20:09.941
In the hummus!
Come on, helga!

20:09.943 --> 20:12.043
-  <i>( underwear stretches )</i>
<i>- ( yelps ) sorry, helga.</i>

20:12.045 --> 20:13.544
I love your fingers.

20:13.546 --> 20:15.513
You could be
a hand model.

20:18.617 --> 20:20.551
I'm never gonna
see liv again.

20:20.553 --> 20:24.021
I just wish my family
would go back to normal!

20:24.023 --> 20:26.090
<i>( ominous tone )</i>

20:29.428 --> 20:31.128
Maddie?

20:31.130 --> 20:32.530
- Maddie?
- ( snoring )

20:32.532 --> 20:33.531
Maddie?

20:33.533 --> 20:35.733
- Liv! ( gasps )
- oh.

20:35.735 --> 20:38.002
Ooh, oh.

20:38.004 --> 20:39.637
I'm still in my knee brace.

20:39.639 --> 20:41.038
Oh, yeah, of course.

20:41.040 --> 20:42.673
Wow, you were
really under.

20:42.675 --> 20:44.642
What are you
talking about?

20:44.644 --> 20:45.643
Hypnotherapy.

20:45.645 --> 20:47.411
We just spent
the last hour

20:47.413 --> 20:51.415
Of using your injured knee
to shoot a three-pointer,

20:51.417 --> 20:53.050
Remember?
You kept saying,

20:53.052 --> 20:56.187
"I can make a three.
I can make a three."

20:58.023 --> 21:00.091
I did make a three.

21:02.027 --> 21:04.996
We even made your
fear into a monster
and gave it a name.

21:04.998 --> 21:06.097
What, helga?

21:09.501 --> 21:11.102
Hey, mads, I really need
to talk to you.

21:11.104 --> 21:14.071
- Liv! ( chuckles )
- hi. ( chuckles )

21:14.073 --> 21:16.540
Um, I just wanted to apologize
for trying to change

21:16.542 --> 21:17.808
The theme
of screamfest to brown.

21:17.810 --> 21:18.976
-  <i>I just--</i>
<i>- no no no no no.</i>

21:18.978 --> 21:20.945
I love brown.
And I love you.

21:20.947 --> 21:22.513
And don't try
to change anything,

21:22.515 --> 21:23.948
Because I like things
just the way they are.

21:23.950 --> 21:25.883
( sighs )

21:25.885 --> 21:27.718
Perfect.
Because the two of us

21:27.720 --> 21:30.087
Can go as the scariest
combination of brown of all...

21:30.089 --> 21:31.956
Beige and taupe.
( gasps )

21:31.958 --> 21:33.457
It's like blah
meets blah.

21:33.459 --> 21:34.525
( laughs )

21:36.828 --> 21:39.497
Yeah, and I have
a tan suede vest

21:39.499 --> 21:40.998
If you wanna go
as triplets.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.501
Yeah, definitely not triplets.

21:43.503 --> 21:45.136
Ew.

21:49.474 --> 21:52.076
When you awake,
you will feel ready

21:52.078 --> 21:53.944
To take on
the world.

21:55.914 --> 21:57.081
( chuckles )
I've never
tried this

21:57.083 --> 21:59.150
Without the amulet,
so how do you feel?

22:00.118 --> 22:01.185
Ooey.
( chuckles )

22:01.187 --> 22:02.653
What?

22:03.655 --> 22:04.655
Ooey.

22:05.590 --> 22:06.624
Ooey?

22:06.626 --> 22:07.925
Ooey?!

22:07.927 --> 22:09.260
Ooey!  Ooey!

22:09.262 --> 22:11.062
Ooey!  Ooey!  Ooey!
Ooey!  Ooey!

22:12.497 --> 22:14.565
Really have
to finish that
online course

22:14.567 --> 22:16.500
Before I try
that again.

22:16.502 --> 22:17.768
Helga:  <i>Kneel before helga!</i>
