00:25.242 --> 00:26.243
Where are you headed?

00:32.902 --> 00:33.772
East.

00:34.556 --> 00:36.036
Are we even going east?

00:36.079 --> 00:38.386
Yeah.
Northeast to be exact.

00:38.429 --> 00:39.430
Where are you headed?

00:41.215 --> 00:42.477
Providence.

00:42.520 --> 00:44.261
What's in Providence?

00:44.305 --> 00:45.045
A guy?

00:45.697 --> 00:46.742
A guy. It's a guy.

00:47.438 --> 00:48.483
It's always a guy.

00:49.397 --> 00:51.051
-What's his name?
-Roger.

00:51.094 --> 00:53.792
- What's his name?
- Roger.

00:53.836 --> 00:55.011
Have you known each other long?

00:56.143 --> 00:57.796
No, we are 16.

00:57.840 --> 00:59.972
We fall in love much later
but that's when we met.

01:00.016 --> 01:01.452
I first saw his face through
a window.

01:03.150 --> 01:04.498
It was raining
and he was wearing

01:04.542 --> 01:05.717
a black pea coat.

01:07.154 --> 01:07.806
Oh, he had...

01:09.286 --> 01:11.810
the funniest way of
telling stories about his past.

01:11.854 --> 01:14.987
Each time, he re-tells one
he gets a little bigger,

01:15.031 --> 01:16.467
a little more dramatic.

01:16.511 --> 01:17.642
A little bigger.
A little more dramatic.

01:17.686 --> 01:19.992
Like he was constantly
work-shopping them.

01:20.036 --> 01:23.126
He was trying to will,
the eventual story,

01:23.170 --> 01:25.041
the not real one,

01:25.085 --> 01:28.175
into something much better
than the truth ever was.

01:28.218 --> 01:29.437
Or ever could be.

01:30.699 --> 01:31.743
Yeah.

01:33.310 --> 01:34.920
Sounds so strange
with ever something so...

01:37.532 --> 01:38.794
endearing about it.

01:39.664 --> 01:40.883
When did you last see him?

01:42.276 --> 01:43.625
"Fuck You"

01:43.668 --> 01:45.844
♪ You wanna tell me
how to do it♪

01:47.933 --> 01:50.458
♪ You wanna tell me
what's going on ♪

01:52.547 --> 01:55.115
♪ Hey man do you know
how to do it♪

01:57.682 --> 02:01.033
♪ Fuck you I know
what'’s going on♪

02:07.388 --> 02:11.609
♪ Do you wanna tell me
where to end♪

02:17.615 --> 02:18.616
Uh!

03:28.991 --> 03:29.992
Ah!

03:53.233 --> 03:54.234
Okay.

04:37.755 --> 04:40.932
- Hmm, oh, oh, hey,
- Hi.

04:40.976 --> 04:42.717
Ah! Hi!

04:44.588 --> 04:45.720
Who are you?

04:47.156 --> 04:49.376
-George.
-Hi, George.

04:50.115 --> 04:51.203
Ah, where are we?

04:51.943 --> 04:52.770
In my apartment.

04:53.510 --> 04:54.555
Yeah, and where is that?

04:56.731 --> 04:57.819
Santa Monica.

04:58.385 --> 04:59.560
Okay.

04:59.603 --> 05:01.213
And how did I get here?

05:02.302 --> 05:03.607
I don't know.

05:03.651 --> 05:05.087
Who are you?

05:05.130 --> 05:06.131
I'm Izzy.

05:07.089 --> 05:09.265
-Did we, uh...
-Yeah.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.398
Well, I mean, I saw
a condom wrapper but...

05:11.441 --> 05:13.182
-Yeah, we--
-Well that's good.

05:13.225 --> 05:13.965
That's good.

05:15.402 --> 05:17.360
I mean, not that I think
you're sketchy or anything.

05:17.404 --> 05:19.754
No, no, I get it and you know.

05:19.797 --> 05:21.408
Same, at least we got
that part right.

05:21.451 --> 05:23.061
What are...

05:23.105 --> 05:24.889
Please, tell me I've got nothing
to do with that.

05:24.933 --> 05:26.891
-All that.
-No, don't worry about that.

05:26.935 --> 05:29.416
That was earlier in the night
at work, that I do remember.

05:29.459 --> 05:30.504
This...

05:31.896 --> 05:33.594
You read all 'em?

05:35.030 --> 05:37.728
Are you asking me
if my books are for show?

05:37.772 --> 05:38.773
Yeah.

05:39.730 --> 05:41.602
Nah, I try to read every night,

05:41.645 --> 05:43.560
you know, at least an hour
before I go to sleep.

05:45.432 --> 05:46.128
Ah!

05:46.911 --> 05:48.086
What are you reading now?

05:49.044 --> 05:50.306
Uh...

05:50.350 --> 05:53.265
- Moby Dick actually.
- Oh, damn!

05:53.309 --> 05:56.399
-Yeah.
-You re-reading or never read?

05:56.443 --> 05:59.794
Might be a surprise
but I never read.

05:59.837 --> 06:01.230
No, I don't know you,

06:01.273 --> 06:03.580
so I dunno
if it would be a surprise.

06:03.624 --> 06:06.627
So, what's going on here?

06:06.670 --> 06:11.196
George got a well curated
literature collection.

06:11.240 --> 06:16.158
Sparse design sense. You make
some money but not too much.

06:16.201 --> 06:17.812
You are doing
something creative,

06:17.855 --> 06:20.510
cause, freaking everybody in LA
does something creative.

06:22.382 --> 06:23.992
Writer's too obvious,

06:24.035 --> 06:25.776
you're an editor?

06:27.343 --> 06:30.477
No, I'm a helicopter pilot.

06:30.520 --> 06:33.088
Uh, yeah, I fly
from North Beach Harbor

06:33.131 --> 06:34.785
to Catalina Bay and back.

06:36.265 --> 06:37.614
All day, every day.

06:37.658 --> 06:41.052
Wait, that's reality,
you're not making that up?

06:41.096 --> 06:44.012
-Yeah, that's real.
-That's amazing.

06:44.055 --> 06:45.274
I mean, you are saying that

06:45.317 --> 06:47.058
cause you don't do it
all day, every day.

06:47.102 --> 06:49.496
Sure, but I mean, I still think
you're seriously underplaying

06:49.539 --> 06:51.759
the importance of being
able to say,

06:51.802 --> 06:54.109
"I'm a fucking helicopter pilot
and it not be a lie."

06:56.111 --> 06:59.027
-Well, yeah, it has its perks.
-Yeah.

06:59.070 --> 07:00.942
Well, I think we just solved
90 percent of the mystery

07:00.985 --> 07:02.073
of how I ended up here.

07:02.944 --> 07:04.336
Hmm.

07:04.380 --> 07:05.773
And what's the other 10 percent?

07:07.818 --> 07:09.080
Your post card collection.

07:11.866 --> 07:13.781
I do road trips, you know.

07:13.824 --> 07:16.131
Every couple of years
I did a cross country

07:16.174 --> 07:19.264
and everywhere I went
I picked up a post card.

07:19.308 --> 07:20.309
Why?

07:22.180 --> 07:22.877
No reason.

07:23.617 --> 07:24.661
Can you take me home?

07:25.967 --> 07:27.272
How'd you know
you didn't drive here?

07:27.316 --> 07:28.360
My car's at the mechanic.

07:29.144 --> 07:29.840
Ah!

07:31.015 --> 07:33.017
Yeah, I don't even know
if I drove here.

07:33.061 --> 07:34.584
I hope not.

07:34.628 --> 07:35.846
What are your instincts saying?

07:39.720 --> 07:40.808
Here.

07:44.159 --> 07:45.769
-No, God, no it's okay.
-It's all right.

07:46.901 --> 07:48.163
-Yeah,
-I know you...

07:48.206 --> 07:50.905
No, no, it didn't-- I mean...
it was weird.

07:50.948 --> 07:52.210
-Yeah.
-Just thought maybe...

07:52.254 --> 07:54.212
- Okay.
- So, yeah.

07:54.256 --> 07:55.213
So bye.

08:15.930 --> 08:17.061
It's called America.

08:19.890 --> 08:21.196
You're disgusting.

08:31.685 --> 08:32.729
What a bitch!

08:37.908 --> 08:38.953
What the fuck!

08:42.826 --> 08:44.611
No, no, no, no, no...

08:48.049 --> 08:49.529
Fucking pick up! Hi!

08:50.834 --> 08:53.358
Yeah, yeah, no shit, that's why
I'm calling.

08:53.402 --> 08:55.012
What do you mean,
"Don't be mad."

08:55.056 --> 08:57.580
I shouldn't be finding out about
this on your fucking Instagram.

08:57.624 --> 08:59.451
Because you should've told me.

09:01.323 --> 09:03.281
I can't believe
you are fucking engaged.

09:04.979 --> 09:06.023
Okay.

09:07.590 --> 09:09.461
When? You mean tonight?

09:10.245 --> 09:11.725
At fucking five!

09:11.768 --> 09:12.987
Oh my God! Where?

09:14.554 --> 09:16.991
What?
No, you better fucking tell me.

09:17.034 --> 09:18.862
Fucking tell me,
you shallow cunt!

09:22.387 --> 09:23.388
Hello?

09:24.259 --> 09:25.260
Hello?

09:31.179 --> 09:32.180
Fu...

09:34.922 --> 09:36.532
...uck!

09:46.760 --> 09:48.109
I need my fucking car, Dick.

09:49.719 --> 09:51.112
Oh blessed Santa, whoa, whoa.

09:51.155 --> 09:52.461
-I need my fucking car, Dick.
-Izz.

09:52.504 --> 09:54.115
Izzy, what's crackin'?
What're you doing here?

09:54.158 --> 09:56.857
-I need my fucking car, Dick.
-You wanna-- you want it now?

09:56.900 --> 09:58.641
Yes. Now.

09:58.685 --> 10:00.904
You said, "It would be done,"
two weeks ago.

10:00.948 --> 10:03.472
I pay you every time I have.
Where are my fucking keys?

10:03.515 --> 10:05.256
Okay, here's your keys.

10:05.300 --> 10:06.301
-Jeez.
-Thank you.

10:07.432 --> 10:08.651
Keep your car, have it.

10:08.695 --> 10:11.611
Great, yeah.

10:11.654 --> 10:14.918
Cause you ain't going nowhere.

10:14.962 --> 10:16.267
You see that?

10:16.311 --> 10:17.660
Good, that's what we've got.

10:18.574 --> 10:20.097
Ah! Fuck!

10:20.141 --> 10:22.491
No! Fuck! God damn it!

10:22.534 --> 10:24.580
-Fuck!
-And it goes that.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.800
I know exactly what you need.

10:26.843 --> 10:29.063
Yup, I know what you need,
hold on girl.

10:29.106 --> 10:30.542
That's way too much,
that's a lot.

10:30.586 --> 10:32.066
- Oh God.
- That is a lot.

10:32.109 --> 10:33.894
I know exactly what you need.
Look.

10:33.937 --> 10:35.286
-Here you go.
-Whoa, whoa.

10:35.330 --> 10:37.245
What are you doing with that?

10:37.288 --> 10:38.942
-I'm putting it in your drink.
-No.

10:38.986 --> 10:40.814
No, you're not putting it in my
fucking drink. I can't get sick.

10:40.857 --> 10:43.860
I've got to... get somewhere
and fuck some shit up.

10:43.904 --> 10:45.906
This is fine, it's European egg.

10:45.949 --> 10:47.037
What?
Is that supposed to mean

10:47.081 --> 10:48.648
- something to me?
- Really?

10:48.691 --> 10:52.216
Like these eggs here in America.
All being genetically

10:52.260 --> 10:55.393
processed by Monsanto.
Monsanto is killing us.

10:55.437 --> 10:56.873
-Don't you understand that?
-Okay, stop.

10:56.917 --> 10:58.222
This is not your fucking
twitter feed.

10:58.266 --> 11:00.703
-Just give me the drink.
-Take it, take it.

11:00.747 --> 11:02.792
Take it, drink it. Yup.

11:03.837 --> 11:05.708
It helps you feel better.

11:05.752 --> 11:07.710
- Oh God, that yolk.
- Yup.

11:07.754 --> 11:09.233
That happens every time.

11:10.495 --> 11:12.323
Gotta calm down, Izzy.

11:13.890 --> 11:15.326
I need my fucking car, Dick.

11:15.370 --> 11:17.328
When is it gonna be done?

11:18.678 --> 11:19.853
I took the money,

11:20.767 --> 11:21.376
bought some parts.

11:22.986 --> 11:25.641
Man, now, this-- this-- this car
have been through a lot, man.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.208
a lot of war wounds
under that hood.

11:34.084 --> 11:34.694
Hey!

11:35.782 --> 11:36.870
What's this?
What's going on here?

11:36.913 --> 11:38.436
What? Huh? About that?

11:38.480 --> 11:39.960
-What? Nothing.
-Yeah.

11:44.138 --> 11:45.139
Okay.

11:46.923 --> 11:47.707
You see her?

11:48.620 --> 11:49.665
She stands there every day.

11:50.753 --> 11:54.757
Same place. Same time.
She smokes.

11:54.801 --> 11:56.541
A single bud. Alright.

11:57.629 --> 12:00.328
And she savors
every moment of it.

12:00.371 --> 12:01.938
Have you ever talked to her?

12:01.982 --> 12:06.073
Hmm-mm.
No, no, no, no.

12:06.116 --> 12:07.161
You can't talk to her.

12:08.205 --> 12:09.511
-Let me talk to her for you.
-No.

12:09.554 --> 12:10.642
-Yeah.
-No.

12:10.686 --> 12:11.861
-Yes.
-No, you can't.

12:11.905 --> 12:13.167
Yeah, I'll just figure out
what she's about.

12:13.210 --> 12:14.690
I won't say your name,
I won't make it obvious.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.866
-I'll just get a sense of her.
-No. It's not about that.

12:16.910 --> 12:19.173
It's about the way...

12:19.216 --> 12:19.869
I wanna see her.

12:20.783 --> 12:22.785
You know.
Like her truth...

12:23.830 --> 12:26.267
for me is... is in here.

12:28.486 --> 12:30.619
Now, look, the other day

12:30.662 --> 12:31.838
she was just here, right,

12:31.881 --> 12:33.709
and it was raining,
it was gushing rain.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.232
Like the type of rain, it just--

12:35.276 --> 12:38.322
gets rid of all the smog,
like that smell of rain.

12:38.366 --> 12:42.326
And she went under the overhang
and just stood there.

12:42.370 --> 12:44.589
Just stoic, like she is now.
Look, look, look, look.

12:46.591 --> 12:47.810
Just like that.

12:47.854 --> 12:48.768
Like she has something

12:49.769 --> 12:52.206
that she don't wanna tell
anybody.

12:52.249 --> 12:53.381
She keeps it inside.

12:54.338 --> 12:55.775
But, man, let me tell you...

12:57.298 --> 12:57.907
I saw it.

12:59.256 --> 13:01.476
It was like droplets just
running down her face.

13:01.519 --> 13:03.173
And if you didn't know
or look closely,

13:03.217 --> 13:05.654
you would've thought
it was the rain.

13:05.697 --> 13:06.786
but it wasn't.

13:07.395 --> 13:08.526
It was her tears.

13:10.006 --> 13:12.269
And that tears were just mixing
with the rain, and...

13:12.313 --> 13:14.445
'Cause she can't hide it,
she let it go.

13:16.273 --> 13:18.536
Look, I don't know, it's like--

13:18.580 --> 13:20.495
I got-- I got nothing for you,
okay.

13:21.888 --> 13:23.585
Don't worry about it.

13:23.628 --> 13:25.021
I'll just a...

13:26.631 --> 13:27.894
See you next week.

13:27.937 --> 13:29.591
I won't-- the car won't be done.

13:31.680 --> 13:33.290
-See you soon.
-All right.

13:38.339 --> 13:40.907
Oh, here you are.
Who's got the time?

13:43.344 --> 13:45.259
Oh you got the fucking time
or what?

13:45.302 --> 13:47.565
Oh, shit, alright, yeah.

13:47.609 --> 13:48.871
It's 11:45.

13:52.440 --> 13:53.441
A.M.?

13:55.312 --> 13:56.313
Uh...

13:57.097 --> 13:58.054
yeah.

13:59.099 --> 14:00.100
Right.

14:00.970 --> 14:02.711
Gotta fucking run.

14:14.810 --> 14:16.072
Really good.

14:31.696 --> 14:32.741
Case...

15:14.826 --> 15:16.654
- Hey.
- Hi.

15:16.698 --> 15:18.221
What are you doing?

15:18.265 --> 15:20.397
I think I misplaced my passport.

15:20.441 --> 15:23.531
-Oh, you taking a trip?
-Yeah, Machu Picchu.

15:23.574 --> 15:25.794
Zika. Risky and expensive.

15:25.837 --> 15:27.013
I heard different.

15:27.056 --> 15:28.318
Who are you going with?

15:28.362 --> 15:29.406
Char Davies.

15:30.407 --> 15:33.367
-Char?
-Yes, Casey, Char Davies.

15:33.410 --> 15:35.021
Is that short for Charles,
or something?

15:35.064 --> 15:36.500
No, it's just Char.

15:36.544 --> 15:37.980
Put that on my baby name list.

15:38.024 --> 15:39.764
I do have a thought though...

15:39.808 --> 15:42.985
What about using this trip money
and moving off my couch?

15:43.029 --> 15:44.204
Do you know what?

15:44.247 --> 15:46.336
The trip's on Char,
so no dice just yet.

15:48.251 --> 15:49.470
Blood or wine?

15:49.513 --> 15:50.079
Both?

15:51.037 --> 15:52.473
Fuck, Izzy, that catering job

15:52.516 --> 15:54.170
-was good fucking job.
-I know.

15:54.214 --> 15:55.867
I stuck my neck out for you
on that one.

15:55.911 --> 15:57.739
I know, okay, I know,
I'm sorry.

15:57.782 --> 15:59.741
Is that why you were rummaging
through my drawers for money?

15:59.784 --> 16:00.481
Okay.

16:02.135 --> 16:04.572
If time travel existed, I'd make
sure that it would never happen.

16:04.615 --> 16:05.703
That.

16:05.747 --> 16:07.357
Not like, taking a bullet
for Lincoln?

16:07.401 --> 16:08.402
Oh, I don't know...

16:09.838 --> 16:12.058
What would that be,
like a time machine scenario,

16:12.101 --> 16:14.712
-or more of a monkey--
-What's the money for?

16:14.756 --> 16:16.671
I have to get
somewhere, tonight.

16:16.714 --> 16:19.326
Or now, fuck.
I have to get somewhere now.

16:19.369 --> 16:20.370
Fuck.

16:25.201 --> 16:26.159
What?

16:28.204 --> 16:29.205
I was invited.

16:32.556 --> 16:33.862
Casey wait.

16:33.905 --> 16:35.385
-Take me with you.
-No, I'm not fucking going.

16:35.429 --> 16:37.866
-Fuck Whitney!
-Go, take me with you.

16:37.909 --> 16:39.911
What, 'cause you are gonna
break up their engagement?

16:39.955 --> 16:41.130
-It's over.
-No, no, no.

16:41.174 --> 16:42.479
Nothings over till I say it is.

16:42.523 --> 16:43.915
You're aware of how insane
that sounds, right?

16:43.959 --> 16:45.308
-It's gonna work.
-Based on what?

16:45.352 --> 16:46.657
Rock solid intelligence.

16:46.701 --> 16:48.050
-From where?
-Peter Percy.

16:48.094 --> 16:49.225
-Roger's dad?
-Yes.

16:49.269 --> 16:50.574
-Why?
-We are Facebook friends. Here.

16:50.618 --> 16:53.012
-Oh my God!
-Read the message. All of it.

16:57.059 --> 16:58.321
Sweet shorts, Tom.

16:59.975 --> 17:01.672
I know you are being sarcastic.

17:01.716 --> 17:03.196
But the shammy on these shorts

17:03.239 --> 17:06.025
were precisely designed
with multiple densities of foam

17:06.068 --> 17:07.852
to minimize saddle fatigue.

17:07.896 --> 17:11.030
And they are road tested
by Vincenzo Nibali himself.

17:11.073 --> 17:13.771
So, yeah,
they are pretty fucking sweet.

17:13.815 --> 17:16.165
Okay, sorry, my brain
just murdered itself

17:16.209 --> 17:18.079
after he heard the word
'saddle fatigue'.

17:18.124 --> 17:19.951
Nobody says 'sweet' anymore.

17:19.994 --> 17:22.606
It just your people
that talk like that.

17:22.650 --> 17:24.086
What do you mean, "your people?"

17:24.130 --> 17:28.308
Other people of your ilk,
i.e. assholes.

17:28.351 --> 17:30.179
Have you packed your shit yet?

17:30.223 --> 17:32.486
Baby, has she packed
her shit yet?

17:32.529 --> 17:33.574
What's he talking about?

17:35.924 --> 17:37.708
We decided, it's time
for you to go.

17:38.796 --> 17:40.233
What?

17:40.276 --> 17:42.626
Forty-eight hours.
And your ass is out.

17:42.670 --> 17:45.412
No, Casey, I don't have anywhere
else to go.

17:45.455 --> 17:47.414
I'm not gonna just throw you out
on the street.

17:47.457 --> 17:50.112
But baby,
we talked about this.

17:50.156 --> 17:51.853
We can't just kick her out.

17:51.896 --> 17:53.898
-Yes, we can.
-No, Tom, listen.

17:53.942 --> 17:56.423
I'm sorry, okay.
I was being a dick.

17:56.466 --> 17:58.338
I love your shorts.

17:58.381 --> 18:00.427
I don't give a fuck.

18:00.470 --> 18:03.299
We are starting a family,
and you don't fit those plans.

18:03.343 --> 18:05.475
Can you at least give me
some time to find a new place?

18:05.519 --> 18:08.043
How long you need?
Another week?

18:08.087 --> 18:10.045
-Another month?
-I don't know.

18:10.089 --> 18:12.874
What do you know, Izzy?
Why did you move here?

18:12.917 --> 18:15.137
Why is the guitar still
in the fucking box?

18:15.181 --> 18:19.359
Because I'm waiting on a couple
West Coast booking agents.

18:19.402 --> 18:21.143
Labels keep fucking
standing me up, okay?

18:21.187 --> 18:22.797
Virginia quit on me
with no warning.

18:22.840 --> 18:25.321
-Two years ago.
-Fine Tom, you caught me.

18:25.365 --> 18:27.062
It takes fucking time
to start over.

18:27.106 --> 18:29.151
Then you need to speed
that shit up.

18:29.195 --> 18:32.415
-I played South by Southwest.
-Three years ago!

18:32.459 --> 18:35.505
"Dig This" was on heavy rotation
on Sirius XMU.

18:35.549 --> 18:36.419
Four years ago!

18:37.333 --> 18:39.683
My songs are all over Spotify.

18:39.727 --> 18:42.033
Oh yeah? Which ones?

18:42.077 --> 18:43.644
The ones with Virginia?

18:43.687 --> 18:45.559
Cause I was on Spotify earlier,

18:45.602 --> 18:47.865
and I didn't see your shit
anywhere on there.

18:47.909 --> 18:49.171
You are an asshole.

18:49.215 --> 18:50.346
I'm right.

18:50.390 --> 18:52.653
You're a fucking asshole.

18:52.696 --> 18:55.090
Listen, you played
the Mercury Lounge,

18:55.134 --> 18:56.483
right after she quit.

18:56.526 --> 18:57.875
And as much as it pains me

18:57.919 --> 19:00.617
to say this with every fiber
in my body,

19:00.661 --> 19:01.966
you killed it.

19:02.010 --> 19:04.273
Straight crushed it.
Un-fucking-believable.

19:04.317 --> 19:06.057
But you weren't this.

19:06.928 --> 19:08.451
Whatever this is.

19:08.495 --> 19:10.018
You are fucking mess.

19:15.632 --> 19:16.894
Move!

19:18.200 --> 19:20.420
I'm trying to take a shower.
Casey!

19:20.463 --> 19:22.248
Come get your friend.
Oh, oh!

19:29.255 --> 19:30.734
-What the fuck...
-Hey!

19:30.778 --> 19:32.301
-...is wrong with you?
-Let me borrow your car, Casey.

19:32.345 --> 19:34.521
-I have work tonight.
-No, I'll drop you off.

19:34.564 --> 19:36.523
You pulled me out of the gutter
when my sister died.

19:36.566 --> 19:38.481
So, I've put up with a lot,
a lot.

19:39.787 --> 19:40.831
I have limits.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.531
And protecting this engagement
is one of them?

19:44.574 --> 19:45.793
No.

19:45.836 --> 19:48.230
No, I'm just not gonna enable
you anymore.

19:48.274 --> 19:50.754
Casey, you read the messages.

19:50.798 --> 19:53.279
Roger's dad wished things
turned out differently.

19:53.322 --> 19:57.065
Yeah.
And he's sure Roger does too.

19:57.108 --> 19:59.415
No, that's just something
people say to be polite.

19:59.459 --> 20:01.591
-No, not in this case.
-Sweetie...

20:01.635 --> 20:03.985
Okay, listen to me.
I had this dream last night

20:04.028 --> 20:05.247
that I was trying
to get to Providence.

20:05.291 --> 20:06.596
-A dream?
-Right?

20:06.640 --> 20:08.076
This morning, I wake up
in this guys' apartment,

20:08.119 --> 20:10.383
and he has this postcard hanging
on his bathroom wall.

20:10.426 --> 20:11.732
I'm sorry, where did you
get this?

20:11.775 --> 20:13.255
-It's irrelevant.
-It actually sounds

20:13.299 --> 20:15.431
-the opposite of irrelevant.
-Okay, here.

20:15.475 --> 20:18.739
Look, at the address on Roger
and Whitney's invitation.

20:18.782 --> 20:21.132
-Providence Road?
-You are reaching.

20:21.176 --> 20:22.351
No, no, no, no.

20:22.395 --> 20:24.135
Don't you fucking act like
I'm a batshit.

20:24.179 --> 20:26.007
You believe in this stuff too.
I know you do.

20:26.050 --> 20:28.662
You told me tons of stuff
like this about you and Tom.

20:28.705 --> 20:30.968
- That was different.
- Why?

20:31.012 --> 20:32.231
Why was it different?

20:32.274 --> 20:34.624
Because he wasn't engaged
to a fucking snake

20:34.668 --> 20:36.147
that used to be
your best friend?

20:37.236 --> 20:39.107
It-- it doesn't end well
for you,

20:39.150 --> 20:40.413
Izzy, I'm promising you that.

20:40.456 --> 20:41.457
Casey...

20:42.763 --> 20:46.288
I am 35 dollars overdrawn
on my bank account.

20:46.332 --> 20:47.550
-Okay?
-Right.

20:47.594 --> 20:49.117
-My credit is blown to shit.
-Right, okay.

20:49.160 --> 20:52.338
So you need to understand
that that's what this is about.

20:52.381 --> 20:53.687
Your life is fucked,

20:53.730 --> 20:56.994
and now you want Roger
to come in and save you.

20:57.038 --> 20:58.474
Please, help me.

20:58.518 --> 21:01.521
You're the only person
I know in Los Angeles.

21:01.564 --> 21:02.696
What about Virginia?

21:04.263 --> 21:05.873
The only person
that would help me.

21:08.179 --> 21:08.745
Please, Casey.

21:10.094 --> 21:12.401
Please, let me borrow your car.
I'm begging you.

21:14.795 --> 21:17.363
No, absolutely not.
Take the bus.

21:19.190 --> 21:20.191
The bus?

21:20.931 --> 21:22.803
Oh, fuck you.

21:22.846 --> 21:27.111
Name me one person, that's ever
taken a fucking bus in LA, ever.

21:27.155 --> 21:30.071
-Tom loves the bus.
-I... fucking hate Tom.

21:30.114 --> 21:32.639
Look, I'm sorry, but if you
get there, that's on your own.

21:32.682 --> 21:33.814
Please, no.

21:51.048 --> 21:54.138
♪ You follow me
on the fucking street♪

21:54.182 --> 21:57.751
♪ You make me feel like
a piece of meat♪

21:57.794 --> 22:01.842
♪ You think I don't know
what war means♪

22:01.885 --> 22:05.367
♪ Now I'm the terrorist
see how it feels♪

22:05.411 --> 22:08.805

gouge out your eyes♪

♪ You laugh at me

22:38.400 --> 22:40.054
Oh, shit, this is taking
too long.

22:41.447 --> 22:42.709
Hello!

22:42.752 --> 22:43.405
Walt, hi!

22:44.450 --> 22:46.016
Come on, I know
you are in there.

22:46.060 --> 22:48.323
Hey, can you--
can you let me in?

22:48.367 --> 22:49.368
Can you just open the door?

22:50.760 --> 22:53.720
Hey, I paid the errands service.
I know you got paid.

22:53.763 --> 22:55.199
No, no, no, I did.
Thank you for that.

22:55.243 --> 22:58.246
-Okay, what do you want?
-I need a job, Walt.

22:58.289 --> 23:00.509
Wha-- I didn't engage
the TaskRabbit app so...

23:00.553 --> 23:02.598
No, I know, I'm working as
an independent contractor now.

23:02.642 --> 23:04.121
I'm just looking to run
a really quick

23:04.165 --> 23:05.601
errand for you
to make a little bit of money.

23:05.645 --> 23:07.255
-I don't have anything.
-Come on, man.

23:07.298 --> 23:10.389
Everyone got something, and you,
especially are someone that--

23:10.432 --> 23:12.260
generally, I mean this
in the best possible way,

23:12.303 --> 23:13.827
it needs a lot done for them.

23:13.870 --> 23:15.306
I asked you
to write a breakup letter

23:15.350 --> 23:17.047
-for my girlfriend.
-I did, and you loved it.

23:17.091 --> 23:18.092
It didn't work.

23:18.135 --> 23:19.833
She's still my girlfriend.

23:19.876 --> 23:22.096
The website said, "satisfaction
guaranteed." I'm not satisfied.

23:22.139 --> 23:23.445
You were when I handed it in.

23:23.489 --> 23:24.925
Because I thought it would work.

23:24.968 --> 23:26.492
You know what, Walt...

23:26.535 --> 23:29.451
Not to split hairs here,
but that really has more to do

23:29.495 --> 23:31.235
with her satisfaction
than yours.

23:31.279 --> 23:33.063
And, those snickerdoodles
you baked for my book club?

23:33.107 --> 23:34.674
They went stale the next day.

23:34.717 --> 23:36.415
You put them in the fridge,
didn't you?

23:36.458 --> 23:38.199
I told you,
that would ruin them.

23:38.242 --> 23:39.243
Fridge keeps things safe.

23:40.288 --> 23:41.811
You know, what you need?
Tupperware.

23:41.855 --> 23:43.117
I'll go get it for you,
right now.

23:43.160 --> 23:44.510
-That's an errand.
-Tomorrow.

23:44.553 --> 23:45.989
I don't have time for this
right now. I'm coding.

23:46.033 --> 23:47.251
-I'm on a tough deadline.
-Please, man.

23:51.212 --> 23:53.127
No!

23:53.170 --> 23:54.911
God damn it.

23:54.955 --> 23:56.217
Jesus!

23:57.261 --> 23:58.785
No, it looks like...

23:58.828 --> 24:00.177
All right.

24:01.440 --> 24:02.571
Cause it looks like this chick
came over,

24:02.615 --> 24:03.659
drank a shit ton of beer

24:03.703 --> 24:04.878
and then passed out
on that chair.

24:06.053 --> 24:08.621
Okay, so, it's exactly
what it looks like.

24:10.318 --> 24:12.276
Jesus! How'd she get here?

24:12.320 --> 24:13.452
I'm on a date.

24:14.453 --> 24:15.454
This is how it ended up.

24:18.152 --> 24:20.981
I'll remove her for you.
There, that's a task.

24:21.024 --> 24:22.896
She looks a bit
on a sketchy side, so...

24:22.939 --> 24:24.288
Forty bucks, we'll call it even.

24:24.332 --> 24:26.465
I don't want her to leave.

24:26.508 --> 24:27.814
- Okay?
- Oh.

24:29.250 --> 24:30.251
Okay.

24:32.558 --> 24:33.472
Okay.

24:35.256 --> 24:37.171
It's okay. Um...

24:39.956 --> 24:42.263
Just... follow my lead okay?

24:42.306 --> 24:43.351
-Just trust me.
-No, Izzy no--

24:43.394 --> 24:45.135
Walt, just get down here.

24:46.136 --> 24:47.137
Okay.

24:48.487 --> 24:49.966
- Oh! Fuck me.
- What?

24:50.010 --> 24:51.315
What?

24:51.359 --> 24:52.621
Nothing, um...

24:54.580 --> 24:55.885
So, you...

24:57.060 --> 24:58.932
love this girl, right?

25:00.020 --> 25:02.065
-I do.
-Yes, okay.

25:02.109 --> 25:03.023
You need to tell her.

25:04.154 --> 25:07.375
-I know. I will, eventually.
-No, now.

25:07.418 --> 25:09.246
-Do it now.
-Now she's passed out.

25:09.290 --> 25:11.205
Exactly. This is the best time.

25:11.248 --> 25:13.555
-No, what are you talking about?
-Listen...

25:13.599 --> 25:18.647
Until you say them, the words,
that you feel so deeply in here,

25:18.691 --> 25:22.042
that you so desperately want
to say to her....

25:22.085 --> 25:22.912
Don't be afraid.

25:24.218 --> 25:26.481
You won't know,
if you can find the courage.

25:26.525 --> 25:29.136
But, once you say them out loud,
even just to yourself,

25:29.179 --> 25:30.441
then you'll know.

25:30.485 --> 25:32.443
-You can do it.
-No, this is ridiculous.

25:32.487 --> 25:34.445
So what? What do you have
to lose by trying?

25:34.489 --> 25:35.925
It's-- it's embarrassing.

25:35.969 --> 25:37.405
-I don't wanna be embarrassed.
-It's just impossible.

25:37.448 --> 25:39.276
-She is passed out.
-You are not.

25:40.495 --> 25:41.540
Walt.

25:42.236 --> 25:42.976
Hey.

25:43.933 --> 25:46.109
I've done a lot of stuff
for you.

25:46.153 --> 25:47.154
Odd stuff.

25:47.981 --> 25:49.199
Have I ever judged you?

25:50.984 --> 25:52.289
-No.
-Exactly.

25:53.029 --> 25:54.640
This is a safe space.

25:55.902 --> 25:58.078
Now, say it.

25:58.121 --> 25:59.383
Do it. Feel.

26:01.734 --> 26:04.258
What! No, you fucking psycho.
Say it what you feel.

26:04.301 --> 26:05.346
-Okay.
-Jesus!

26:05.389 --> 26:07.261
No, I can't do this,
it's impossible.

26:07.304 --> 26:08.871
-It's not gonna happen.
-Just say it.

26:08.915 --> 26:10.743
Woo her.
Just like in the movies.

26:10.786 --> 26:12.353
This isn't like the movies.

26:12.396 --> 26:14.050
No, fine, not even the movies
are like the movies anymore.

26:14.094 --> 26:16.923
-What? I already told you.
-No-- okay.

26:16.966 --> 26:18.968
Just watch me, okay,
I'll go first.

26:25.235 --> 26:26.236
I...

26:28.325 --> 26:30.371
should've told you this sooner.

26:33.374 --> 26:35.115
God, I should've told
you every day.

26:37.508 --> 26:39.598
Your touch still...

26:40.860 --> 26:42.426
echoes.

26:44.951 --> 26:47.606
I can still feel your hand
cupping my cheek.

26:49.869 --> 26:52.741
Your lips,
pressing against mine.

26:57.703 --> 27:00.270
The first time I saw your face,
it was through a window.

27:02.664 --> 27:05.319
It was raining, and...

27:05.362 --> 27:06.755
you know, bla bla bla.

27:07.800 --> 27:09.018
That was amazing.

27:10.411 --> 27:12.587
Yeah, fine. Now you do it.

27:12.631 --> 27:14.720
No, you already said it,
you know,

27:14.763 --> 27:15.764
Walt.

27:20.203 --> 27:20.943
Okay,

27:22.075 --> 27:23.685
Remember the first time
last night.

27:23.729 --> 27:25.556
Come on, dude. Start over.

27:26.906 --> 27:28.168
When-- when...

27:29.343 --> 27:32.215
You know, we mash together
really well.

27:32.259 --> 27:33.390
Okay, Walt.

27:35.349 --> 27:37.046
Feel. Okay.

27:39.048 --> 27:40.180
Okay.

27:42.269 --> 27:43.270
I've gone--

27:45.054 --> 27:46.621
There's moment when your...

27:47.927 --> 27:51.017
your finger looped over
the rim of your glass.

27:51.060 --> 27:52.888
And your-- your lip curled.

27:54.194 --> 27:55.369
And you said,

27:55.412 --> 27:57.197
"This is the moment
everything changes."

27:59.242 --> 28:02.202
And, you grabbed the back
of my neck really hard, and...

28:02.245 --> 28:04.334
squeezed as hard as you could,
and...

28:04.378 --> 28:06.032
and you laughed when I flinched.

28:08.382 --> 28:10.689
And, it felt infinite.

28:14.867 --> 28:16.564
I wanna hold you.

28:16.607 --> 28:18.305
I'm terrified,
it'll never happen.

28:24.877 --> 28:26.008
That was good.

28:27.401 --> 28:29.533
-That was good?
-Yeah.

28:29.577 --> 28:30.621
That was perfect.

28:33.059 --> 28:35.104
You know,
when she's lucid again,

28:35.148 --> 28:36.410
you can do it for real.

28:39.413 --> 28:41.197
Yes, okay.

28:41.241 --> 28:42.459
So...

28:42.503 --> 28:43.852
my work is done.

28:43.896 --> 28:45.898
What do you think?
Like 40 bucks feels appropriate?

28:45.941 --> 28:48.465
Less, of course
the price of this water.

28:48.509 --> 28:51.381
I'm sorry Izzy, I don't have any
cash right now.

28:51.425 --> 28:52.121
What?

28:52.905 --> 28:54.558
You didn't feel like...

28:54.602 --> 28:56.386
-like, mentioning that before?
-I didn't know

28:56.430 --> 28:57.823
you need to get paid
like this minute.

28:58.911 --> 29:01.130
I need to get somewhere now.

29:01.174 --> 29:02.653
Can you help me get there?

29:04.090 --> 29:05.918
-Where are you headed?
-Huh?

29:05.961 --> 29:11.097
Uh, uh, up in the hills,
past Silver Lake and Los Feliz.

29:11.140 --> 29:13.316
-Los Feliz?
-Whatever.

29:13.360 --> 29:14.361
Yeah.

29:14.970 --> 29:16.493
-Yeah.
-What!

29:16.537 --> 29:18.060
-I'll give you a ride.
-Amazing.

29:18.104 --> 29:19.845
I live in Glendale so it's
definitely on the way somewhere.

29:19.888 --> 29:21.411
-Amazing!
-No, I was--

29:21.455 --> 29:22.935
I was gonna make us
poached eggs

29:22.978 --> 29:24.023
-and cinnamon toast.
-No.

29:24.066 --> 29:26.895
Well, that does sound dope.

29:26.939 --> 29:30.116
It does and, I really want
to but, I really can't.

29:30.159 --> 29:31.117
We gotta...

29:32.858 --> 29:34.468
-Let's go, girlfriend.
-Okay.

29:34.511 --> 29:35.991
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

29:36.035 --> 29:37.123
Oh.

29:37.950 --> 29:39.429
You still owe me 40 bucks.

29:41.910 --> 29:44.652
Walt, let'’s do this again
sometime.

29:44.695 --> 29:45.566
Yeah.

29:46.088 --> 29:46.959
For real.

29:49.048 --> 29:50.092
Okay?

29:52.834 --> 29:53.966
Yeah.

30:04.367 --> 30:06.717
Sorry, you had to see me
that way.

30:06.761 --> 30:08.850
It's not really me, I'm just...

30:08.894 --> 30:11.026
having a bit
of a rough patch lately.

30:12.288 --> 30:13.333
Tell me about it.

30:14.987 --> 30:15.988
Oh yeah?

30:17.032 --> 30:18.338
You mean to tell you right now?

30:19.730 --> 30:20.514
Yeah.

30:21.254 --> 30:23.212
No, I mean like, same.

30:39.272 --> 30:40.186
I get the Benson.

30:41.796 --> 30:42.753
It's my name.

30:43.798 --> 30:44.799
Don't worry, though.

30:55.723 --> 30:56.724
Whatever.

31:00.249 --> 31:02.295
So, I ended up
with the Masters.

31:02.338 --> 31:04.601
- From Princeton?
- In bio science.

31:04.645 --> 31:06.603
But, you know,
I'm a little bit of a... legacy.

31:06.647 --> 31:08.127
My dad went there, so...

31:08.170 --> 31:09.389
The whole system
was a bit rigged.

31:09.432 --> 31:10.825
St-- Why are we stopping?

31:10.869 --> 31:13.436
I just gotta run a quick errand.
You are still okay.

31:13.480 --> 31:14.481
Uh...

31:15.656 --> 31:17.049
How far are we?

31:17.092 --> 31:19.747
You are gonna be fine.
That isn't a problem, right?

31:19.790 --> 31:20.487
You got like...

31:21.357 --> 31:22.793
two and a half hours. Right?

31:22.837 --> 31:25.144
It's only like a 10,
20 minutes'’ drive, tops.

31:26.449 --> 31:29.235
- Who's house is this?
- My friends'.

31:29.278 --> 31:30.366
She's out of town.

31:32.978 --> 31:36.155
Anyways,
like I was saying.

31:36.198 --> 31:38.200
I got this degree, right?

31:38.244 --> 31:39.854
-Yeah, from Princeton.
-Yeah.

31:39.898 --> 31:41.160
And, I realized...

31:42.726 --> 31:44.337
that my life didn't turn out

31:44.380 --> 31:46.469
the way I imagined it would
at all.

31:47.731 --> 31:50.038
God, the more and more
I talk to people,

31:50.082 --> 31:52.562
the more it seems to be
everyone's story.

31:52.606 --> 31:53.346
Really?

31:55.000 --> 31:56.871
Cause see, I'm starting to think
it's the exact fucking opposite

31:56.915 --> 31:59.308
and that there are a lot
of people out there who...

31:59.352 --> 32:00.570
are actually living...

32:01.702 --> 32:03.443
exactly what they dreamed.

32:03.486 --> 32:05.706
Right? Like Steven Spielberg.

32:05.749 --> 32:07.316
Okay? The director.

32:07.360 --> 32:10.711
That fucker, is definitely
living the life he dreamed.

32:10.754 --> 32:11.712
Uh, yeah.

32:12.887 --> 32:14.628
That's a pretty
extreme case, though.

32:14.671 --> 32:16.630
I mean, you don't think
he's in the minority.

32:19.067 --> 32:20.677
I mean, he's a Jew,

32:21.591 --> 32:22.592
but um...

32:24.072 --> 32:26.466
but, I don't wanna make
this like a race...

32:26.509 --> 32:28.381
issue or whatever so...

32:30.383 --> 32:32.776
While we're on the subject,
what about

32:32.820 --> 32:34.822
Barack fucking Obama, right?

32:34.865 --> 32:35.997
Boom!

32:36.041 --> 32:39.087
That guy is definitely
living his dream.

32:39.131 --> 32:40.784
I mean, you don't think he's

32:40.828 --> 32:42.743
even got further
than he imagined?

32:42.786 --> 32:44.310
No, I think,

32:44.353 --> 32:48.096
he knew exactly, exactly,
that he's gonna be a President.

32:48.140 --> 32:50.011
I mean, and he's black,
I mean...

32:50.055 --> 32:51.970
you might as well say he's...

32:52.013 --> 32:53.449
half white, but that's
beside the point.

32:53.493 --> 32:55.103
He willed that shit to happen.

32:55.147 --> 32:56.757
So you just don't believe
in fate.

32:56.800 --> 32:59.325
No, hell no, and--

32:59.368 --> 33:01.588
I mean, really,
I don't understand how you can.

33:01.631 --> 33:02.415
Because...

33:03.807 --> 33:05.592
what I never understood about
believing in fate,

33:05.635 --> 33:08.508
is how pointless it makes
everything seem.

33:08.551 --> 33:10.118
-No.
-It's like, why try

33:10.162 --> 33:12.033
if everything just gonna happen
the way it's gonna happen.

33:12.077 --> 33:13.556
You know,
it's like who gives a shit.

33:13.600 --> 33:16.037
Like with you
and this-- this party.

33:16.081 --> 33:17.778
-You know...
-Yeah.

33:17.821 --> 33:22.130
I mean, every place I go today,
there is some sign,

33:22.174 --> 33:24.089
confirming for me
that this is exactly

33:24.132 --> 33:26.395
-what I'm supposed to be doing.
-Right.

33:26.439 --> 33:28.267
So, if you believe in that

33:28.310 --> 33:30.965
then essentially,
no matter what you do today,

33:31.009 --> 33:33.533
you are gonna end up there.

33:33.576 --> 33:35.752
-So, why try so fucking hard.
-No, no, no, no.

33:35.796 --> 33:38.277
You can't just sit on your ass
totally inert.

33:38.320 --> 33:40.975
I mean, if you do then that
was your fate to begin with.

33:41.019 --> 33:43.064
Fate and will
have to work together.

33:43.108 --> 33:45.980
Well, that's what you said,
but that's not like you.

33:46.024 --> 33:47.112
Really, no.

33:47.155 --> 33:49.897
Oh, no, it's just
belief in an idea

33:49.940 --> 33:51.029
that were all interconnected.

33:52.247 --> 33:54.510
-You need some help?
-No, no.

33:59.907 --> 34:00.777
I'm fine.

34:01.256 --> 34:02.301
Keep going.

34:02.344 --> 34:04.390
Okay, how I think about it
is that

34:04.433 --> 34:06.479
like all our fates are colliding
all the time, right.

34:06.522 --> 34:07.915
-Mm-hmm.
-I mean, look at us.

34:07.958 --> 34:09.482
Over the course
of each of our lives

34:09.525 --> 34:12.789
we've both made a billion
tiny choices that led both of us

34:12.833 --> 34:15.400
to be at Walt's
at the exact same time today.

34:15.444 --> 34:16.402
-Aha.
-Well, come on,

34:16.445 --> 34:17.793
there is meaning in that.

34:17.838 --> 34:22.321
There is no meaning in the fact
that I saw, uh...

34:22.364 --> 34:25.280
-Walt.
-A-- yes, that I saw...

34:26.760 --> 34:29.415
-Walt.
-Walt, yes, I saw fucking Walt,

34:29.458 --> 34:31.938
his photo, on my Tinder feed,
and I thought,

34:31.982 --> 34:34.027
he looks all right,
so we decided to meet up,

34:34.072 --> 34:36.683
and then it turns out, he's just
a grade-A chicken shit.

34:36.726 --> 34:39.728
So, I got wasted,
and I passed out.

34:39.773 --> 34:42.775
There's absolutely no meaning
in that.

34:45.648 --> 34:46.301
Oh!

34:47.476 --> 34:49.391
It's just a bunch
of random fucking chaos.

35:09.150 --> 35:10.282
Wanna give me a boost?

35:12.066 --> 35:13.154
Look, my--

35:13.198 --> 35:14.982
I'm... I'm house sitting
for my friend

35:15.025 --> 35:16.157
and I lost--

35:16.201 --> 35:17.289
The key's inside.

35:25.427 --> 35:27.125
So, what do you want?

35:27.168 --> 35:30.606
A drink or beer or anything
while you're waiting?

35:30.650 --> 35:32.217
-Sure, yeah, I'll have a beer.
-Yeah.

35:34.480 --> 35:35.350
Thanks.

35:36.873 --> 35:38.571
Yes, lukewarm, microbrew.
Just like the Europeans drink.

35:38.614 --> 35:40.573
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
they don't drink this.

35:40.616 --> 35:43.184
And they wonder why
they lost World War II.

35:43.228 --> 35:44.229
What?

35:49.103 --> 35:49.799
See.

35:51.105 --> 35:53.107
Yeah listen, I really have to go
to this party.

35:53.151 --> 35:55.936
Yes, I know. Two seconds
in and out, I promise.

36:34.496 --> 36:35.671
Fuck, motherfucker.

36:37.934 --> 36:39.762
-Hey.
-Oh, hey.

36:39.806 --> 36:41.677
-Where are you going?
-Emergency, gotta bounce.

36:41.721 --> 36:43.331
Who the fuck
is this guy?

36:43.375 --> 36:45.028
This is Rabbit, he's harmless.

36:45.072 --> 36:46.378
Fuck you, he's harmless!

36:46.421 --> 36:47.857
Put that needle down,
you shithead!

36:47.901 --> 36:49.642
-Don't call me names.
-Can you tell him

36:49.685 --> 36:51.034
to put this fucking thing down.

36:51.078 --> 36:52.558
Don't talk through me,

36:52.601 --> 36:54.255
talk to me.
I'm right here, ma'am.

36:54.299 --> 36:56.431
He's my boyfriend okay,
we are in love.

36:56.475 --> 36:58.390
-Yeah.
-Rabbit, come on let's go.

36:58.433 --> 37:00.305
Move, get the fuck out of there.

37:01.654 --> 37:04.439
You just robbed
your friends place?

37:04.483 --> 37:06.789
Long and short answer, yes.
Okay.

37:06.833 --> 37:08.008
Hey, thank you for that boost.

37:08.051 --> 37:10.010
What the fuck am I supposed
to do now?

37:10.053 --> 37:11.490
You believe in fate, right?

37:12.795 --> 37:15.189
-I don't know, where I am.
-Well, then...

37:15.233 --> 37:16.277
That's your fate.

37:17.931 --> 37:18.932
Let's go, Rabbit.

37:21.456 --> 37:22.849
I'm sorry.

37:24.329 --> 37:25.808
Rabbit!

37:27.810 --> 37:28.637
Damn it!

37:29.334 --> 37:31.031
No, you're driving.

37:31.074 --> 37:32.250
You're driving.

37:32.293 --> 37:34.687
What the fuck is wrong with you?

38:01.235 --> 38:03.324
-Yeah?
-Hi. I'm returning this to you.

38:03.368 --> 38:05.500
-I don't want this garbage.
-Would you please just take it.

38:05.544 --> 38:06.719
So you can feel better

38:06.762 --> 38:08.329
like you did a good deed
or something.

38:08.373 --> 38:10.418
Yes, actually, I think
you'll regret it if you don't.

38:10.462 --> 38:11.854
Says you.

38:14.074 --> 38:15.641
Hey, what are you thinking?

38:15.684 --> 38:17.425
I didn't say, you could come in.

38:17.469 --> 38:18.600
-Sorry.
-No, no, no.

38:18.644 --> 38:20.036
Just take--

38:20.080 --> 38:22.125
I'll take it, I'll take it,
fine. Alright. Jesus.

38:22.169 --> 38:23.126
Go, go.

38:24.389 --> 38:26.391
Can you at least tell me
where I am?

38:31.396 --> 38:33.746
What do you mean,
where you are?

38:33.789 --> 38:37.271
Look, it's a long story
but my...

38:37.315 --> 38:39.404
friend left me here, and...

38:40.970 --> 38:44.452
I'm new to LA, I don't know--
what neighborhood is this?

38:44.496 --> 38:46.933
It's called
the Miracle Mile.

38:46.976 --> 38:49.196
I don't know why they
call it but they just do.

38:49.239 --> 38:51.590
Okay, is it, close to Los Feliz?

38:51.633 --> 38:52.895
Is it-- can I walk there?

38:54.244 --> 38:57.770
Well, you could but...
it would be late.

38:57.813 --> 38:58.814
How late?

38:59.511 --> 39:00.555
Tomorrow.

39:06.996 --> 39:08.084
Okay.

39:12.132 --> 39:14.526
What if...
I can hitchhike or something.

39:15.701 --> 39:17.355
What's in Los Feliz?

39:18.530 --> 39:19.400
What?

39:20.358 --> 39:21.707
A party, an engagement party.

39:23.186 --> 39:27.190
I'm guessing that maybe
you weren't exactly invited.

39:27.234 --> 39:28.104
Yeah.

39:29.584 --> 39:30.324
Okay, well...

39:31.673 --> 39:35.068
I don't have a car
but I can give you directions.

39:35.111 --> 39:39.986
And... maybe a beer for the trip
or something. Come on.

39:40.029 --> 39:41.030
Come on.

39:42.380 --> 39:44.251
You can come in now.

39:46.253 --> 39:49.952
Can you grab me some,
hydrogen peroxide too?

39:49.996 --> 39:50.692
Don't worry.

39:52.215 --> 39:55.523
Nothing a tetanus shot
and a good AIDS test won't fix.

39:57.046 --> 39:58.483
Don't make me change
my mind.

39:59.875 --> 40:00.746
Shoes off.

40:28.643 --> 40:30.036
- Don't touch it.
- Sorry.

40:32.342 --> 40:33.343
Wha--

40:35.520 --> 40:37.522
Why are you painting this?

40:37.565 --> 40:39.959
Well, you see,
I don't leave here now.

40:40.002 --> 40:42.440
Well, I mean, I should say
I'm working on it.

40:42.483 --> 40:44.833
Well, I'm actually trying
to do that but...

40:44.877 --> 40:47.619
When I paint this stuff,
you know...

40:47.662 --> 40:48.881
I think...

40:48.924 --> 40:50.665
if I paint it and I
look at it every day,

40:50.709 --> 40:53.494
then eventually it'll just
sort of...

40:53.538 --> 40:56.062
It'll drag me out to see them.

40:59.674 --> 41:00.675
Thanks.

41:06.681 --> 41:07.769
What's in there?

41:10.293 --> 41:14.297
Just, you know, memories
and things I wished for.

41:20.565 --> 41:21.522
Sorry.

41:23.916 --> 41:25.091
Did they come true?

41:29.182 --> 41:30.357
Let's see.

41:35.449 --> 41:36.450
This...

41:37.495 --> 41:39.497
This is my husband, Ethan.

41:39.540 --> 41:41.063
-Whoa!
-Yeah.

41:41.847 --> 41:43.152
Is he still alive?

41:43.196 --> 41:44.197
He is.

41:45.590 --> 41:46.808
But you are not together?

41:48.593 --> 41:49.942
And this...

41:49.985 --> 41:51.813
This is what is known,

41:51.857 --> 41:54.555
as the lost art form
of the mix tape.

41:55.643 --> 41:57.079
And here's your great bands.

41:57.123 --> 41:58.428
Susie and the--

41:58.472 --> 41:59.517
-Ohh.
-I saw her.

41:59.560 --> 42:01.040
You-- you know, I saw--

42:01.083 --> 42:03.172
I saw her at
the Palladium in 1933.

42:03.216 --> 42:04.391
-Stop.
-Yeah.

42:04.434 --> 42:06.524
-It changed my life.
-Oh, my God.

42:06.567 --> 42:08.917
You see, we used to use these--
we used to use these

42:08.961 --> 42:11.572
to tell stories to each other,
you know, we would...

42:11.616 --> 42:12.921
Now, Ethan,

42:12.965 --> 42:14.444
He used to--
he used to start off

42:14.488 --> 42:16.664
and the opening songs
would always be

42:16.708 --> 42:20.538
like totally full of hope
and optimism and everything.

42:20.581 --> 42:23.105
And, you know, by the time
he got to the end,

42:23.149 --> 42:25.586
it was like
all about loss and...

42:25.630 --> 42:26.848
sadness.

42:33.246 --> 42:34.682
I could show you this.

42:46.651 --> 42:48.783
Because I miss you,
that's why.

42:48.827 --> 42:49.915
Yeah, I miss you.

42:52.395 --> 42:53.353
Hmm.

42:54.093 --> 42:55.834
Just a moment in time.

42:55.877 --> 42:57.270
Three seconds.

43:03.972 --> 43:06.105
Because I miss you
that's why.

43:06.148 --> 43:07.193
Yeah, I miss you.

43:09.543 --> 43:10.413
Hmm.

43:14.156 --> 43:15.767
You hope you imagine,

43:17.420 --> 43:19.640
you know, that all of this
will be a story

43:19.684 --> 43:22.338
that's told to somebody
some time.

43:22.382 --> 43:23.992
Maybe your children to theirs.

43:25.124 --> 43:27.779
We putt off having kids
and then...

43:27.822 --> 43:29.476
it was too late, you know.

43:30.999 --> 43:32.566
Too old.

43:34.437 --> 43:36.875
And then it's over,
and the story just starts to...

43:36.918 --> 43:38.093
disappear.

43:39.268 --> 43:40.356
Hmm.

43:41.401 --> 43:42.402
And then...

43:43.533 --> 43:44.534
young love...

43:46.058 --> 43:47.581
the one that meant the most...

43:49.409 --> 43:50.802
it's just in that box.

43:56.068 --> 43:57.852
Well, you better get going,

43:57.896 --> 43:59.593
or you never have a chance
to make it.

44:11.910 --> 44:14.956
Okay, where are you going
in Los Feliz?

44:15.000 --> 44:17.176
Uh... Providence Road.

44:18.090 --> 44:20.483
Oh yeah, I see it.

44:20.527 --> 44:23.051
It's up there
in the hills there.

44:23.095 --> 44:24.705
It's pretty straight shot.

44:24.749 --> 44:27.926
A couple of twist and turns
at the end but you know...

44:27.969 --> 44:30.406
I'm sure
you'll make it alright.

44:30.450 --> 44:32.582
Oh, look at this. Hey!

44:34.280 --> 44:35.847
All right.

44:35.890 --> 44:37.544

Well, you making it, of course.

44:42.070 --> 44:43.419
You making it.

44:44.377 --> 44:45.639
All right.

44:45.683 --> 44:47.032
All the way to the end.

44:47.075 --> 44:48.120
All the way.

44:52.080 --> 44:53.255
Ugh!

44:53.299 --> 44:54.648

44:54.692 --> 44:56.737

I can see my future when,
I look into your eyes, Leo.

48:52.407 --> 48:55.410
Every time you're gone,
it feels fucking endless, Leo.

48:55.454 --> 48:58.761
Listen, the sound of your voice,
and touch of your lips

48:58.805 --> 49:00.850
is like fucking heaven
to me, Leo.

49:02.026 --> 49:03.941
Your cock, it's fucking perfect.

49:03.984 --> 49:06.334
Nothing ever fit
like that before.

49:06.378 --> 49:10.425
I've never cum so hard
before in my fucking life, Leo.

49:10.469 --> 49:13.211
-No, no, I mean...
-No?

49:13.254 --> 49:14.560
Listen.

49:14.603 --> 49:16.127
You are not the first.

49:16.170 --> 49:18.956
You are
just the fucking creepiest!

49:18.999 --> 49:20.131
Izzy.

49:20.174 --> 49:21.610
Is that you?

49:21.654 --> 49:23.699
- Hey.
- Hey, oh my God it is.

49:23.743 --> 49:25.571
Izzy. Get over here.

49:26.833 --> 49:29.053
-Hey, Bennett.
-Give me a break.

49:29.096 --> 49:30.315
How are you?

49:30.358 --> 49:32.056
Good, Ben. How are you?

49:32.099 --> 49:34.754
Amazing.
I'm so excited that you're here.

49:34.797 --> 49:36.756
-Thanks, me too.
-Leo, you're taking off?

49:36.799 --> 49:39.715
-Yeah, man, see you later.
-Okay, man, love you.

49:39.759 --> 49:41.717
-Um...
-God, it's so good to see you.

49:41.761 --> 49:44.242
Why didn't you respond
to my e-vite?

49:44.285 --> 49:46.070
I didn't hear from you,
I didn't know you were coming.

49:46.113 --> 49:47.549
-E-vite?
-Yeah.

49:47.593 --> 49:50.030
I sent it to you, man.
I sent it to...

49:50.074 --> 49:51.597
Izzy69@aol.

49:52.685 --> 49:56.167
-I-- I-- Did you say "aol"?
-Yeah.

49:56.210 --> 49:58.212
I don't think that's anyone'’s
email anymore.

49:58.256 --> 50:00.475
Well,
it didn't bounce back so,

50:00.519 --> 50:01.999
somebody definitely got it.

50:06.873 --> 50:08.135
So psyched you're here.

50:08.179 --> 50:10.703
Virginia, did you say hello
to your sister?

50:10.746 --> 50:11.530
I didn't.

50:12.922 --> 50:15.360
Alright, I'm gonna let
you guys catch up.

50:15.403 --> 50:16.535
I'll be right back.

50:16.578 --> 50:17.971
That is a very cool jacket
by the way.

50:26.588 --> 50:27.589
I need a ride.

50:39.949 --> 50:41.908
Alright, that's tonight.

50:41.951 --> 50:43.040
Roger and Whitney.

50:44.215 --> 50:45.912
You were invited?

50:45.955 --> 50:48.436
Uh, no,
not even she's that dumb.

50:48.480 --> 50:49.916
For the record, I would've gone.

50:49.959 --> 50:51.091
Whitney's mom is known

50:51.135 --> 50:52.397
for the legendary food
at her parties.

50:52.440 --> 50:54.181
Apparently one of
Jose Andre's underlings

50:54.225 --> 50:55.313
is preparing the menu.

50:55.356 --> 50:56.749
All molecular gastronomy

50:56.792 --> 50:58.229
which of course is cliché
at this point

50:58.272 --> 50:59.882
but who cares,
it still tastes amazing.

50:59.926 --> 51:02.842
Okay, the party's starting soon.
I need to get there.

51:02.885 --> 51:03.886
For what?

51:04.539 --> 51:05.540
We're in love.

51:06.324 --> 51:07.934
This isn't how it ends.

51:07.977 --> 51:10.415
Um, actually this seems to be
exactly how it ends.

51:13.374 --> 51:14.375
I need your help.

51:15.768 --> 51:17.465
If you don't help me,
I won't get there in time.

51:17.509 --> 51:21.382
Will you please for once
just fucking do that?

51:21.426 --> 51:23.428
I think your time
might be better spent

51:23.471 --> 51:25.647
meditating on the series
of brilliant and impressive

51:25.691 --> 51:27.127
life choices you made
to end up here,

51:27.171 --> 51:29.129
looking like that without
even forty dollars for cab fare.

51:29.173 --> 51:31.000
Fuck you. Fuck you!

51:31.044 --> 51:32.045
Choices?

51:33.699 --> 51:35.092
You abandoned me.

51:35.135 --> 51:36.919
I stepped off the Titanic
before it hit an iceberg.

51:36.963 --> 51:39.139
-What? We were so close.
-To what?

51:39.183 --> 51:40.923
Going on tour
and losing less money?

51:40.967 --> 51:42.708
We lived in a van
for three years.

51:42.751 --> 51:44.318
You're a fucking sell-out.

51:46.190 --> 51:47.452
Fate, right?

51:47.495 --> 51:49.845
This is your destiny - Roger.
Just like that...

51:49.889 --> 51:51.804
song you could never finish.

51:51.847 --> 51:53.849
That sad fantasy of yours

51:53.893 --> 51:57.026
where's it all empty
and beautiful and she's there.

51:57.070 --> 51:58.811
He still loves you Izzy.
It's not too late.

51:58.854 --> 51:59.942
You can make it

51:59.986 --> 52:01.770
Uh, some what? Future you?

52:01.814 --> 52:03.163
Some alternate you?

52:03.207 --> 52:04.991
Oh and then there's
the younger one,

52:05.034 --> 52:06.601
three times the Izzy,

52:06.645 --> 52:09.256
three times the never ending
exhausting drama.

52:09.300 --> 52:12.520
So, let's say you do make it
to good old brilliant Roger

52:12.564 --> 52:15.393
and his affluent world of tech.
Then what?

52:15.436 --> 52:17.003
Uh, destiny fulfilled?

52:17.046 --> 52:20.049
He snaps his fingers and-- and
all your problems disappear,

52:20.093 --> 52:21.660
and you end up years later
someplace like this,

52:21.703 --> 52:23.140
everything in its right place?

52:29.146 --> 52:30.364
Take me.

52:32.366 --> 52:33.715
Or I'll tell Bennett.

52:35.978 --> 52:38.198
Go ahead, he's right there.

52:38.242 --> 52:39.765
- Bennett.
- Yeah, babe?

52:39.808 --> 52:42.202
-Izzy has something to tell you.
-What's up?

52:42.246 --> 52:43.899
Izzy was sneaking around
this side of the house

52:43.943 --> 52:46.989
when she saw me cheating on you,
sleeping with another man.

52:50.515 --> 52:52.821
I don't get it. What's going on?

52:54.780 --> 52:57.086
Go on Izzy, tell him.
That's what you saw, right?

53:04.964 --> 53:05.878
No.

53:06.835 --> 53:08.576
No Bennett, it was just a joke.

53:12.798 --> 53:14.321
I'm sorry, it was just a joke.

53:16.410 --> 53:18.238
That's a really fucked up joke.

53:20.501 --> 53:21.502
Sorry.

53:22.851 --> 53:23.548
I mean...

53:24.766 --> 53:27.116
it's fucking dark,
I guess that's funny.

53:27.160 --> 53:28.596
No, it wasn't, you're right.

53:28.640 --> 53:30.555
I should've thought it through.
It was really...

53:33.471 --> 53:34.950
Hey, what's going on
with your music?

53:34.994 --> 53:36.952
Do you play shows around?

53:36.996 --> 53:39.955
Oh, yeah, I... I got this
new booking agent and she's...

53:39.999 --> 53:42.523
she's done booking me a couple
small things around town,

53:42.567 --> 53:45.700
just to try out new material
but, um...

53:45.744 --> 53:47.572
Um, but yeah, nothing big.

53:47.615 --> 53:49.400
But-- but it's going well.

53:49.443 --> 53:50.705
- It's freaking awesome.
- Yeah.

53:50.749 --> 53:52.577
I was always such a fan
of you, guys.

53:52.620 --> 53:54.274
I was always a groupie,
you know.

53:54.318 --> 53:56.581
- Yeah.
- Yeah I'd love to...

53:56.624 --> 53:57.973
hear something at some point.

53:58.017 --> 53:59.975
I'd love to hear you guys
play a song together.

54:00.019 --> 54:01.020
Yeah.

54:02.978 --> 54:05.024
Why don't you guys play
a song right now?

54:05.067 --> 54:05.938
What?

54:06.852 --> 54:08.680
Us?

54:08.723 --> 54:10.421
Kinda feel
like you owe me for...

54:10.464 --> 54:12.292
No, Bennett I really
would rather not.

54:12.336 --> 54:14.294
Izzy, come on,
it's not a big deal. One song.

54:15.730 --> 54:17.863
One song, um...

54:17.906 --> 54:21.301
Hey everybody, uh, this is Izzy.
This is Virginia's sister.

54:21.345 --> 54:23.172
And they used to play
in a band together

54:23.216 --> 54:25.262
and they wanna
play a song for you guys.

54:25.305 --> 54:27.742
-Bennett I don't wanna--
-It's fine, Virginia.

54:27.786 --> 54:29.004
Come on.

54:29.048 --> 54:30.267
Virginia, come on.

54:31.355 --> 54:32.399
There.

54:32.443 --> 54:34.575
You can pay with kids' guitars.

54:36.273 --> 54:39.711
And now play that song you guys
used to close your shows with.

54:56.336 --> 54:58.164
Hi, we're Kissie Dickens.

55:02.734 --> 55:03.604
And...

55:04.518 --> 55:06.303
this is a Heavens to Betsy song.

55:11.395 --> 55:12.787

What? Fuck you,
those bottles are still open.

01:00:11.608 --> 01:00:13.000

-What are you doing here?

01:01:12.973 --> 01:01:15.802
-Hello, Mrs. Percy. How are you?
-Let's try not to make a scene.

01:01:15.846 --> 01:01:16.542
Shall we?

01:01:18.152 --> 01:01:19.850
I think it's best for everyone
if you come to your senses,

01:01:19.893 --> 01:01:21.721
and leave quietly
with your dignity intact.

01:01:21.765 --> 01:01:22.766
Clearly you overestimate

01:01:22.809 --> 01:01:23.941
how much I care
about my dignity.

01:01:23.984 --> 01:01:25.638
You, help me escort her out.

01:01:25.682 --> 01:01:27.292
- Izzy!
- Oh, fuck you!

01:01:41.262 --> 01:01:43.308
-You are leaving right now.
-Mom, I'll handle this.

01:01:43.351 --> 01:01:44.831
Toast is in five minutes
I need you there.

01:01:44.875 --> 01:01:46.267
Mom, I'll handle it.

01:02:24.262 --> 01:02:25.567
I wanna be with you.

01:02:26.655 --> 01:02:27.569
What?

01:02:27.613 --> 01:02:28.919
Izzy, no, Izzy.

01:02:29.528 --> 01:02:30.529
Please, um...

01:02:35.795 --> 01:02:36.796
This is right.

01:02:38.798 --> 01:02:40.887
-We belong to each other.
-No.

01:02:40.931 --> 01:02:42.628
You do not get to come here
and say this.

01:02:42.671 --> 01:02:43.716
-Yes.
-Okay?

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:44.978
You know this is right.

01:02:45.892 --> 01:02:47.807
You believe in this.

01:02:47.851 --> 01:02:49.766
-I know, you do.
-S-- stop it.

01:02:53.247 --> 01:02:54.292
Look at me.

01:02:56.773 --> 01:02:58.165
Do you remember that night?

01:02:59.863 --> 01:03:01.821
When we were still friends.

01:03:01.865 --> 01:03:03.954
You were in UCLA,
I was in Chicago.

01:03:03.997 --> 01:03:06.565
We went to that party back home.
Over Thanksgiving.

01:03:06.608 --> 01:03:08.697
-That girl Eve's party.
-This is over. Okay?

01:03:08.741 --> 01:03:09.873
And we stood by the window

01:03:09.916 --> 01:03:11.570
and the light
was fucking perfect.

01:03:11.613 --> 01:03:13.398
And you even said
how perfect it was.

01:03:15.269 --> 01:03:17.881
And there was this
freaking moment...

01:03:19.230 --> 01:03:21.841
when we were talking,
and we were laughing,

01:03:21.885 --> 01:03:22.973
and we were drinking,

01:03:23.016 --> 01:03:24.888
and in the mid-sentence,
everything...

01:03:27.368 --> 01:03:28.413
just stopped.

01:03:30.197 --> 01:03:31.808
And the light outside
turned red.

01:03:35.289 --> 01:03:38.815
You looked down at my hands
because they were shaking.

01:03:38.858 --> 01:03:41.208
And you fingers reached out.

01:03:41.252 --> 01:03:43.036
And held them
until they were still.

01:03:45.909 --> 01:03:47.258
And, you said,

01:03:48.346 --> 01:03:49.477
"Are you cold?"

01:03:51.479 --> 01:03:52.480
God...

01:03:53.307 --> 01:03:54.526
I smiled.

01:03:56.354 --> 01:03:58.486
And said... no.

01:04:02.577 --> 01:04:03.970
We moved closer.

01:04:06.712 --> 01:04:07.974
I could feel your breath...

01:04:09.584 --> 01:04:11.064
across my bottom lip.

01:04:12.979 --> 01:04:15.286
Your closed left hand
and brushed my cheek.

01:04:17.070 --> 01:04:18.071
And...

01:04:35.393 --> 01:04:36.568
So softly.

01:04:38.526 --> 01:04:39.832
So deep.

01:04:43.357 --> 01:04:45.359
Oh, I miss that silence.

01:04:51.322 --> 01:04:52.497
It ended.

01:05:03.769 --> 01:05:05.075
We didn't just...

01:05:07.860 --> 01:05:09.253
Drift apart.

01:05:09.296 --> 01:05:10.297
Izzy.

01:05:11.472 --> 01:05:12.778
It was a fucking mess.

01:05:15.085 --> 01:05:16.477
Things got ugly.

01:05:18.218 --> 01:05:19.437
We...

01:05:20.133 --> 01:05:21.134
we did...

01:05:21.830 --> 01:05:22.353
awful...

01:05:23.267 --> 01:05:25.834
terrible things to each other.

01:05:25.878 --> 01:05:29.534
Or have you just conveniently
forgotten about that?

01:05:29.577 --> 01:05:30.535
No.

01:05:31.405 --> 01:05:33.277
A mistake...

01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:35.583
We made a lot of mistakes,
but I'm sorry.

01:05:35.627 --> 01:05:37.498
-I know you're sorry.
-I-- I'm getting married.

01:05:37.542 --> 01:05:38.586
Do you understand?

01:05:39.936 --> 01:05:40.893
This. Us.

01:05:41.589 --> 01:05:43.591
-It's over.
-No.

01:05:43.635 --> 01:05:47.291
No, we-- we can start over,
we have to.

01:05:47.334 --> 01:05:48.596
I know we can.

01:05:50.642 --> 01:05:52.470
You don't love her
like you love me.

01:05:54.646 --> 01:05:55.864
Please, Roger.

01:05:56.865 --> 01:05:58.606
We can make it right, again.

01:06:00.086 --> 01:06:03.655
I promise and-- and-- and--
you believe me.

01:06:03.698 --> 01:06:05.700
I know you do,
I can see it in your eyes.

01:06:05.744 --> 01:06:06.875
Please.

01:06:06.919 --> 01:06:07.920
I'm sorry.

01:06:08.660 --> 01:06:10.314
I'm sorry. I have to go.

01:07:33.310 --> 01:07:36.008
Roger and Whitney!

01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:41.725
Well, uh...

01:08:42.988 --> 01:08:44.424
I could say
this was a pleasant surprise,

01:08:44.468 --> 01:08:45.295
but of course...

01:08:46.644 --> 01:08:49.863
I'm not surprised
and this is far from pleasant.

01:08:49.908 --> 01:08:52.563
I wanted to call you,
so many times.

01:08:52.606 --> 01:08:54.304
I'm glad you didn't.

01:08:54.346 --> 01:08:56.915
But-- I-- I...

01:08:56.957 --> 01:08:58.656
I wanted to tell you
how sorry I am,

01:08:58.698 --> 01:09:02.180
and how awful I feel I-- I
didn't mean for this to happen.

01:09:02.225 --> 01:09:03.356
Oh.

01:09:03.399 --> 01:09:04.531
Yet here we are.

01:09:04.575 --> 01:09:06.707
Roger didn't either, okay?
It just did.

01:09:06.751 --> 01:09:07.795
No.

01:09:09.448 --> 01:09:11.103
You were my best friend,
Whitney.

01:09:13.888 --> 01:09:15.238
I loved you.

01:09:15.281 --> 01:09:16.890
We can still be friends, we--

01:09:16.935 --> 01:09:18.154
Really?

01:09:18.197 --> 01:09:19.328
Cool.

01:09:21.157 --> 01:09:23.376
So, let's all go see
a movie this weekend.

01:09:23.420 --> 01:09:26.292
Or better yet, shall we can go
on a lake trip?

01:09:26.336 --> 01:09:27.554
That way when you guys kiss

01:09:27.598 --> 01:09:28.859
I can pretend
I don't give a shit

01:09:28.903 --> 01:09:30.209
and wonder if in the next room

01:09:30.252 --> 01:09:32.385
you're doing all the butt stuff
that he likes.

01:09:32.429 --> 01:09:33.995
-What butt stuff?
-Ask him.

01:09:34.038 --> 01:09:35.171
His butt or mine?

01:09:35.214 --> 01:09:36.389
Whatever, both.

01:09:36.433 --> 01:09:37.738
Figure it out, ask him.

01:09:38.652 --> 01:09:39.957
But it makes him cum super hard,

01:09:40.001 --> 01:09:42.002
so it will give you
a sense of accomplishment.

01:09:42.046 --> 01:09:44.223
Ew, I shouldn't have asked.

01:09:44.267 --> 01:09:45.398
You're a fraud.

01:09:46.791 --> 01:09:48.009
Do you know that?

01:09:48.966 --> 01:09:49.620
I mean...

01:09:50.577 --> 01:09:52.926
the worst person
I've ever known.

01:09:52.970 --> 01:09:54.842
Our whole friendship,
all those years

01:09:54.886 --> 01:09:57.280
of me going back for you
and protecting you

01:09:57.323 --> 01:09:59.673
and sticking up for you,
all of the--

01:09:59.717 --> 01:10:02.894
fucking amazing wonderful places
we went,

01:10:02.937 --> 01:10:06.245
Iceland, South America,
Australia, all of that...

01:10:06.289 --> 01:10:07.246
is ruined.

01:10:08.465 --> 01:10:10.684
It doesn't exist,
you stole that from me.

01:10:11.859 --> 01:10:13.774
Look if you wanna make
a speech to me

01:10:13.818 --> 01:10:15.211
to make yourself feel better
then...

01:10:15.254 --> 01:10:17.735
I understand it, I deserve it.
I'm sure, just...

01:10:17.778 --> 01:10:19.693
Be done with it, okay?
You don't have to pile on all--

01:10:19.737 --> 01:10:21.260
Oh, fuck you.

01:10:21.304 --> 01:10:23.175
You followed me out here.

01:10:23.219 --> 01:10:24.655
You're not the victim here.

01:10:24.698 --> 01:10:27.875
This is supposed to be
the happiest day of my life.

01:10:27.919 --> 01:10:29.137
You don't deserve it.

01:10:30.356 --> 01:10:31.488

01:18:39.105 --> 01:18:40.150
-Right?
-Ah, fuck.

01:18:40.193 --> 01:18:41.325
Yeah.

01:18:41.368 --> 01:18:42.892
-Am I right?
-No, I can only imagine

01:18:42.935 --> 01:18:44.415
-what he was like at ten. Jesus.
-Yeah.

01:18:44.458 --> 01:18:45.677
He was a maniac.

01:18:45.721 --> 01:18:48.158
He looked like
he didn't even have parents.

01:18:48.201 --> 01:18:49.855
You know, he always had the...

01:18:49.899 --> 01:18:52.815
-snot running down his nose...
-Yeah.

01:18:52.858 --> 01:18:55.513
...and wiping food
on his clothes all the time...

01:18:55.556 --> 01:18:56.906
Y-- yeah he was the whole deal.

01:18:57.820 --> 01:18:59.822
So, anyway, we, uh...

01:18:59.865 --> 01:19:01.824
we're heading up
to this mountain

01:19:01.867 --> 01:19:05.653
and he's been there before.
He-- he'd gone up to...

01:19:05.697 --> 01:19:07.177
just to find his sea legs,

01:19:07.220 --> 01:19:09.657
you know he did
a couple of lessons, and...

01:19:09.701 --> 01:19:12.225
He-- he attacked
the bunny slopes, you know,

01:19:12.269 --> 01:19:14.053
he-- I mean he did a couple
that were like--

01:19:14.097 --> 01:19:15.359
like this kinda thing.

01:19:16.099 --> 01:19:17.709
Izzy, like, uh...

01:19:17.753 --> 01:19:19.798
sort of like, a-- you know but
never anything bigger than that.

01:19:19.842 --> 01:19:21.626
-Yeah.
-But you know, decent.

01:19:21.669 --> 01:19:23.280
We wanted to...

01:19:23.323 --> 01:19:25.282
ski the black diamonds.

01:19:25.325 --> 01:19:26.762
And he chickened out.

01:19:27.588 --> 01:19:28.764
Cried.

01:19:28.807 --> 01:19:29.634
And went home.

01:19:30.504 --> 01:19:32.202
And it was just eating at him.

01:19:32.245 --> 01:19:34.682
You know, it's like he had
to do it.

01:19:34.726 --> 01:19:36.423
His entire life

01:19:36.467 --> 01:19:38.164
was just meaningless.

01:20:06.323 --> 01:20:07.846
...in that car ride
on the way home.

01:20:07.890 --> 01:20:10.849
I'll just never forget that look
on his face.

01:20:16.986 --> 01:20:18.335
It's not how it happened.

01:20:19.945 --> 01:20:21.251
That's exactly how it happened.

01:20:21.294 --> 01:20:22.861
-No, it's not.
-Yeah, Evan I were just talking

01:20:22.905 --> 01:20:24.515
about it last week.

01:20:24.558 --> 01:20:27.997
No you guys were older,
you were like... 14.

01:20:29.999 --> 01:20:30.651
But it's...

01:20:31.957 --> 01:20:34.133
less interesting for the story,
if you're older.

01:20:34.177 --> 01:20:36.788
Alright, fine,
whatever Izzy.

01:20:43.012 --> 01:20:44.796

before the show starts.

01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:45.928
