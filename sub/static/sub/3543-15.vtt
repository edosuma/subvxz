WEBVTT

00:00.984 --> 00:02.410
My name is Elena Gilbert.

00:02.411 --> 00:04.213
I'm a vampire
in search of the cure.

00:04.214 --> 00:05.626
It's a cure
for immortality?

00:05.627 --> 00:08.169
You dig up Silas,
and you've got your cure.

00:08.170 --> 00:09.784
There is only
one dose.

00:09.785 --> 00:11.833
I really want to get
that cure for you.

00:11.834 --> 00:13.744
If I gave you the cure
to save yourself,

00:13.745 --> 00:15.724
you'd give it to Elena,
wouldn't you?

00:15.725 --> 00:18.220
We all wanted to help
Elena get the damn thing...

00:18.221 --> 00:20.107
We risked everything
to get it.

00:21.167 --> 00:23.465
- She's here.
- Aagh!

00:23.466 --> 00:25.580
It's been too long,
little Gilbert.

00:31.949 --> 00:33.620
And we failed.

01:00.048 --> 01:03.217
Jeremy!
Oh, no. No. No.

01:03.218 --> 01:06.787
Oh, no.
Oh, God, no.

01:06.788 --> 01:09.823
Oh, God...

01:09.824 --> 01:11.558
It's fine.
It's fine. It's fine.

01:11.559 --> 01:13.093
You're gonna be ok.

01:13.094 --> 01:14.628
The ring will
bring you back.

01:14.629 --> 01:18.298
It's ok. It's ok.
You're gonna be ok.

01:18.299 --> 01:19.900
You're gonna
be ok, Jeremy.

01:19.901 --> 01:21.368
You're gonna be fine.

01:23.004 --> 01:24.271
How'd this happen?

01:24.272 --> 01:25.706
It was Katherine.

01:25.707 --> 01:26.740
She must have been
following us this whole time.

01:26.741 --> 01:28.509
What about the cure
or Silas?

01:28.510 --> 01:31.145
If there was anything
in there at all, it's all gone.

01:31.146 --> 01:32.379
Where the hell
is Bonnie?

01:32.380 --> 01:33.427
I have no idea.

01:33.428 --> 01:34.581
She went looking
for Jeremy last night.

01:34.582 --> 01:36.517
She never came back.

01:36.518 --> 01:39.353
Damon, Elena is in there
waiting for the Gilbert ring

01:39.354 --> 01:40.988
to bring Jeremy
back to life.

01:40.989 --> 01:42.689
Ok. Fine.
We'll wait with her.

01:42.690 --> 01:45.150
Damon, listen to me.

01:45.927 --> 01:48.762
Jeremy was
one of the five,

01:48.763 --> 01:51.064
a hunter.

01:53.625 --> 01:56.153
He's supernatural.

01:56.967 --> 01:58.905
The ring
won't work anymore.

02:02.641 --> 02:04.977
She won't
survive this.

02:06.613 --> 02:08.082
I'll find Bonnie.

02:08.083 --> 02:09.681
You get Elena
off this island.

02:25.091 --> 02:26.934
Hey, you're home.

02:26.935 --> 02:30.177
I was trying to clean
the burn mark where Kol...

02:32.642 --> 02:35.069
I couldn't
get the spot out.

02:35.703 --> 02:37.543
Come on.
Let's get him upstairs.

02:54.266 --> 02:57.064
Can I get you
anything?

02:57.065 --> 02:58.999
No. I'm fine.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.334
I'm just
gonna sit here

03:00.335 --> 03:02.568
and wait with him
until he wakes up.

03:05.288 --> 03:07.524
Let me know if you hear
anything about Bonnie, ok?

03:08.656 --> 03:10.614
Yeah. Sure.

03:39.974 --> 03:41.975
Unless you're a blond,
a Bennett witch,

03:41.976 --> 03:46.078
or a doppelganger,
I suggest you steer clear.

04:06.099 --> 04:08.969
Where is it,
the cure?

04:08.970 --> 04:11.071
I know someone
has it.

04:11.072 --> 04:13.189
Yes, someone...
Katherine.

04:13.190 --> 04:15.623
Katherine?
The doppelganger?

04:15.624 --> 04:19.046
Yeah. Sneaky, little bitch must've
been spying on us for weeks.

04:19.047 --> 04:22.000
She killed Jeremy...

04:22.000 --> 04:25.185
Or somebody did.

04:25.186 --> 04:27.688
He killed your brother.
Let's not with the fake sad face.

04:27.689 --> 04:29.690
I didn't say I was
going to miss him,

04:29.691 --> 04:30.857
but I'm not heartless.

04:30.858 --> 04:32.046
He was Elena's
only family.

04:32.047 --> 04:33.493
Good. Well, you
can send flowers

04:33.494 --> 04:35.896
- after you help me find Bonnie.
- We need to find Katherine.

04:35.897 --> 04:37.197
If there's one thing
that's a guarantee

04:37.198 --> 04:38.465
in this miserable,
little world,

04:38.466 --> 04:39.733
it's that Katherine Pierce is gone.

04:39.734 --> 04:41.368
We need
to find Bonnie.

04:41.369 --> 04:44.037
Oh, and beware of
the immortal Silas.

04:44.038 --> 04:47.907
If he was asleep in that cave,
he's awake now.

05:11.798 --> 05:14.501
Don't touch it.

05:14.502 --> 05:16.703
I used some of
the island's herbs and berries

05:16.704 --> 05:18.038
to help
treat the wound,

05:18.039 --> 05:19.406
but not being
an actual witch,

05:19.407 --> 05:21.575
I can't guarantee much.

05:21.576 --> 05:23.677
How are you healed?

05:23.678 --> 05:27.648
It was Silas.
He helped me.

05:27.649 --> 05:29.082
You did it, Bonnie.
He's risen.

05:29.083 --> 05:30.217
Get away from me.

05:30.218 --> 05:31.718
I know you're angry
with me, ok,

05:31.719 --> 05:33.620
but now you'll see,
everything I did,

05:33.621 --> 05:35.756
all those lives lost,
they weren't in vain.

05:35.757 --> 05:38.425
Silas is gonna
bring them back.

05:38.426 --> 05:40.160
What you want to do
isn't natural, Shane.

05:40.161 --> 05:42.229
You can't
bring back the dead.

05:42.230 --> 05:45.032
I think you'll
change your mind now.

05:45.033 --> 05:47.534
What do you mean, now?

05:47.535 --> 05:49.936
When Silas awoke,

05:49.937 --> 05:51.805
he had to feed to
gain his strength.

05:51.806 --> 05:54.074
He'd been desiccating
for almost 2,000 years.

05:54.075 --> 05:56.810
He needed blood.

05:56.811 --> 05:58.178
Jeremy was there.

05:58.179 --> 06:00.047
- What are you saying?
- He had...

06:00.048 --> 06:01.248
What are you
saying to me?

06:01.249 --> 06:03.483
He drained him
of his blood, Bonnie.

06:03.484 --> 06:06.085
Jeremy is dead.

06:21.535 --> 06:23.470
How long has she
been like that?

06:23.471 --> 06:24.971
Ever since
we found his body.

06:24.972 --> 06:26.473
She hasn't
said anything

06:26.474 --> 06:27.774
except that she's waiting
for him to wake up.

06:27.775 --> 06:29.343
But he's not
going to wake up.

06:29.344 --> 06:31.711
She knows that, right?

06:34.848 --> 06:38.952
Look. Deep down,
I think she has to,

06:38.953 --> 06:40.754
but we're talking
about Elena here.

06:40.755 --> 06:43.123
She feels grief more
powerfully than anyone else.

06:43.124 --> 06:44.658
I think her denial
is the one thing

06:44.659 --> 06:46.426
protecting her
from letting it all in.

06:46.427 --> 06:48.462
She can't stay
like that forever.

06:48.463 --> 06:51.365
I know, but I don't want to be
the one to break her out of it,

06:51.366 --> 06:53.333
not until we know
that Bonnie is safe,

06:53.334 --> 06:56.636
not until we get Damon
over here to, you know...

06:56.637 --> 06:58.505
Use the sire bond
to convince her

06:58.506 --> 07:00.474
that everything
is ok?

07:00.475 --> 07:03.743
I'm not in denial.

07:07.769 --> 07:10.417
I know that he
was supernatural,

07:10.418 --> 07:13.653
but did you see?

07:13.654 --> 07:15.522
His tattoo is gone.

07:15.523 --> 07:18.725
The tattoo had the spell
that opened Silas' chamber.

07:18.726 --> 07:20.427
Maybe it
being gone means

07:20.428 --> 07:22.195
that he fulfilled his
supernatural destiny.

07:22.196 --> 07:23.864
Maybe he's
back to normal.

07:23.865 --> 07:25.866
- It's possible, right?
- Elena...

07:25.867 --> 07:29.536
It's possible, Caroline.
There's a chance.

07:29.537 --> 07:32.139
It may be miniscule,
but it's hope,

07:32.140 --> 07:33.940
and I'm gonna hold
on to that hope

07:33.941 --> 07:37.659
with everything
that I've got because there's no way...

07:42.449 --> 07:46.886
There's absolutely no way
that my brother is dead.

07:52.926 --> 07:55.227
I'm not in denial.

08:09.468 --> 08:13.032
Hey. I know that I'm not
supposed to be calling,

08:13.033 --> 08:16.402
but something happened, and
I need to talk to you, Tyler.

08:16.403 --> 08:19.236
So please call me.

08:19.237 --> 08:21.307
Do you know
where he is?

08:21.308 --> 08:23.710
As far away from Klaus
as he can get.

08:23.711 --> 08:25.945
Klaus said he wouldn't stop
until he found him.

08:25.946 --> 08:28.615
Well, Katherine has been running
from Klaus for 500 years.

08:28.616 --> 08:31.017
It's not easy,
but it's possible.

08:31.018 --> 08:32.885
It's probably why
she stole the cure.

08:32.886 --> 08:34.486
She wants to bargain
for her freedom.

08:34.488 --> 08:35.889
I just can't believe
after all that,

08:35.890 --> 08:39.926
the cure
is just gone.

08:39.927 --> 08:42.495
Yeah.

08:42.496 --> 08:44.164
I mean, talk
about denial.

08:44.164 --> 08:45.565
In my head,
I was thinking there was no way

08:45.566 --> 08:49.134
Elena was gonna stay
a vampire forever...

08:50.403 --> 08:53.973
And now without
any family.

08:53.974 --> 08:55.742
Well, we can't think
about that right now.

08:55.743 --> 08:57.377
We need to make
plans, lists.

08:57.378 --> 08:59.245
We need a funeral

08:59.246 --> 09:00.613
or a cover story

09:00.614 --> 09:02.482
or a funeral
and a cover story.

09:02.483 --> 09:05.251
I should go tell my mom.
I guess she'll know what to do.

09:05.252 --> 09:06.419
We should get Matt
over here.

09:06.420 --> 09:07.954
You're right.
I will do that.

09:07.955 --> 09:09.255
I will call Matt,
and then I will go tell my mom,

09:09.256 --> 09:12.158
and then I will
make a list or a casserole

09:12.159 --> 09:15.695
or... I don't know...
Whatever people are supposed to do

09:15.696 --> 09:18.363
or make in
these situations.

09:22.769 --> 09:24.600
What's that smell?

09:31.377 --> 09:34.414
It's his body.

09:34.415 --> 09:36.715
He's starting
to decompose.

09:38.785 --> 09:41.687
Tell you mom to get
Dr. Fell over here.

09:44.624 --> 09:46.526
Do you think
Bonnie is dead?

09:46.527 --> 09:49.128
Never thought I'd say this,
but I hope not.

09:49.129 --> 09:50.930
I don't like being out
in the open like this.

09:50.931 --> 09:52.332
What, afraid of
the big, bad Silas?

09:52.333 --> 09:54.300
No.
â™ª Scaredy cat

09:54.301 --> 09:56.035
I'm not a scaredy cat.

09:56.036 --> 09:59.172
My brother Kol drove himself
mad worrying about Silas rising.

09:59.173 --> 10:01.541
It would benefit us all
to be a bit concerned,

10:01.542 --> 10:03.810
and you're one to talk
about being afraid.

10:03.811 --> 10:05.445
You're so scared, you're 1,200 miles
away from where you're supposed to be.

10:05.446 --> 10:07.614
Hey, somebody needed
to find Bonnie.

10:07.615 --> 10:08.915
Stefan could've
done that.

10:08.916 --> 10:10.583
Aren't you Elena's
current love?

10:10.584 --> 10:12.085
It's so hard to keep
track these days.

10:12.086 --> 10:14.087
Shouldn't you be
home comforting her,

10:14.088 --> 10:17.523
or are you terrified of being there
when she realizes her brother is dead?

10:17.524 --> 10:19.492
Ow!
Sorry.

10:19.493 --> 10:21.426
Better you than me.

10:32.171 --> 10:33.506
Aagh! Uh!

10:33.507 --> 10:37.277
Uh! Uh!

10:37.278 --> 10:39.812
Mm, just the guy
I wanted to see.

10:39.813 --> 10:42.314
Not really.

10:49.322 --> 10:51.924
Bonnie, here.
Drink this.

10:51.925 --> 10:53.293
It'll calm you down.

10:53.294 --> 10:55.194
I don't want any of
your stupid teas, Shane.

10:55.195 --> 10:57.629
Bonnie...

10:58.631 --> 11:01.501
Jeremy is dead.

11:01.502 --> 11:02.802
Bonnie, be careful.

11:02.803 --> 11:04.103
Don't let your magic
get out of control.

11:04.104 --> 11:05.672
Bonnie! Come on.

11:05.673 --> 11:07.573
Bonnie, I am not gonna
let you fall apart.

11:07.574 --> 11:10.710
I'm not gonna let you.
Silas needs you.

11:10.711 --> 11:14.280
He can bring Jeremy back.

11:14.281 --> 11:16.949
He can bring
everyone back,

11:16.950 --> 11:19.651
and you're
gonna help him, ok?

11:21.487 --> 11:24.489
You're gonna
see Jeremy again.

11:52.352 --> 11:57.023
Elena?

11:57.024 --> 11:59.225
Meredith? What are
you doing here?

11:59.226 --> 12:01.661
I came to check
on your brother.

12:01.662 --> 12:03.329
May I?

12:03.330 --> 12:05.630
Yeah. Um...

12:10.236 --> 12:12.672
You're not gonna
find any vitals.

12:12.673 --> 12:14.674
It's the same thing that
Ric used to go through.

12:14.675 --> 12:17.477
He'd just be dead
until then he wasn't.

12:17.478 --> 12:19.379
Once, I remember
he was gone

12:19.380 --> 12:23.349
for almost
an entire day.

12:23.350 --> 12:26.919
Ric died, like,
4 times before he lost his mind,

12:26.920 --> 12:29.856
and Jeremy has died
a few times, too...

12:29.857 --> 12:34.360
3, I think... so we're
gonna have to...

12:34.361 --> 12:36.028
So we'll have to
keep an eye on him

12:36.029 --> 12:38.190
because I don't want him to
go crazy just like Ric did.

12:44.470 --> 12:46.873
Elena...

12:46.874 --> 12:49.909
It looks like Jeremy died
of extreme blood loss.

12:49.910 --> 12:52.245
His neck also appears
to be broken.

12:52.246 --> 12:54.514
The lack of blood explains
why there's no lividity,

12:54.515 --> 12:56.149
but his muscles
have tightened

12:56.150 --> 12:57.884
past the point of rigor mortis. No.

12:57.885 --> 13:01.354
If he's left unattended to,
soon he'll start to bloat.

13:01.355 --> 13:03.389
Within a few hours,
his skin will discolor, and...

13:03.390 --> 13:04.957
no. Stop, ok?

13:04.958 --> 13:07.360
Just stop.
He's not dead.

13:07.361 --> 13:09.429
I need you to release
the body to me.

13:09.430 --> 13:10.930
We'll get him
to a funeral home

13:10.931 --> 13:12.398
and prepare him
for a viewing

13:12.399 --> 13:14.567
where you and his friends
can say good-bye to him.

13:14.568 --> 13:17.370
- He's not dead, ok?
- Elena, stop it.

13:17.371 --> 13:19.338
Now you're
all about science?

13:19.339 --> 13:22.408
Where was your science when you used
vampire blood to save my life, huh?

13:22.409 --> 13:25.478
There is no science here.
It's just magic.

13:25.479 --> 13:27.647
We need magic.
We have to find Bonnie.

13:27.648 --> 13:29.649
Bonnie can fix this.
Somebody just get me Bonnie!

13:29.650 --> 13:31.283
Elena...

13:47.300 --> 13:50.670
No. No.

13:50.671 --> 13:55.975
No, Matt. It's fine.
It's ok. It's ok.

13:55.976 --> 13:57.877
Bonnie will
be here soon,

13:57.878 --> 14:00.480
and she'll fix everything,
and it'll be all fine.

14:00.481 --> 14:03.115
Everything
is gonna be fine.

14:03.116 --> 14:05.284
It'll be fine.

14:05.285 --> 14:07.519
It'll be fine.
It'll be fine.

14:23.157 --> 14:25.459
You're not dosing me
again, are you?

14:25.460 --> 14:27.512
Poison your
best friend once,

14:27.513 --> 14:30.498
and suspicion
follows you forever.

14:30.499 --> 14:31.963
Where are Bonnie
and Damon?

14:31.964 --> 14:33.665
We lost Bonnie
on the island.

14:33.666 --> 14:35.730
Damon stayed back
to try and find her.

14:35.731 --> 14:37.969
That's funny.
Doesn't he hate her?

14:37.970 --> 14:40.338
He doesn't hate her.

14:40.339 --> 14:42.607
I think he actually
kind of loves her.

14:42.608 --> 14:45.009
You're mean to the people
that you care about.

14:45.010 --> 14:46.978
That's some
messed-up logic.

14:46.979 --> 14:50.056
- Damon logic.
- Damon logic.

14:55.623 --> 14:57.758
Listen.

14:57.759 --> 14:59.193
I want you to go
somewhere with me.

14:59.194 --> 15:01.062
I can't leave Jeremy. Elena...

15:01.063 --> 15:03.864
There's nothing you
can do right now, ok?

15:03.865 --> 15:05.800
Stefan can
stay here with him.

15:05.801 --> 15:07.934
Come with me.

15:10.371 --> 15:12.439
Please.

15:18.195 --> 15:19.463
Here's the thing.

15:19.464 --> 15:21.298
I was completely willing
to accept the fact

15:21.299 --> 15:23.934
that you were one man on
a lonely mission to kill ol' Silas,

15:23.935 --> 15:27.938
and then I got boned by my Vixen
Nemesis miss Katherine Pierce,

15:27.939 --> 15:29.640
and then I start
thinking

15:29.641 --> 15:31.875
there's no way that
this is a coincidence.

15:31.876 --> 15:36.913
So what
do you know, huh?

15:36.914 --> 15:38.315
Took you long enough.

15:38.316 --> 15:40.083
Sorry. I had to dig
the arrow out of my spine.

15:40.084 --> 15:41.918
Thank you for that.

15:41.919 --> 15:43.587
Well, if you want a lead on
Katherine Pierce, here's your guy.

15:43.588 --> 15:45.188
Torture me
all you want.

15:45.189 --> 15:46.657
You can't kill me.

15:46.658 --> 15:48.292
The hunter's curse
will torment you forever.

15:48.293 --> 15:50.427
- It'll be worth it.
- He's right.

15:50.428 --> 15:52.629
You can't kill him,
but that doesn't mean

15:52.630 --> 15:56.400
we can't tear him
apart piece by piece,

15:56.401 --> 15:59.169
nerve by nerve
until the pain is so severe,

15:59.170 --> 16:00.637
that your brain
shuts it off

16:00.638 --> 16:03.640
to give you one tiny
moment of blessed relief,

16:03.641 --> 16:05.208
and then
we'll heal you

16:05.209 --> 16:08.945
and do it again
and again and again.

16:08.946 --> 16:10.980
- You are creepy.
- Thank you.

16:15.452 --> 16:19.556
I was tracking dens of
vampires across Colorado.

16:19.557 --> 16:23.093
Katherine found me,
said she could help me find Silas.

16:23.094 --> 16:24.961
She already knew
about the hunter's mark,

16:24.962 --> 16:26.330
- the cure.
- How?

16:26.331 --> 16:28.665
Oh, she had someone
on the inside,

16:28.666 --> 16:31.435
some werewolf girl,
friends with your Professor.

16:31.436 --> 16:33.870
Hayley,
Tyler Lockwood's old friend.

16:33.871 --> 16:36.807
Ah, I knew she was shady.
Where'd Katherine find her?

16:36.808 --> 16:40.843
New Orleans.
That's all I know.

16:42.375 --> 16:44.981
Ah. Good.
Let's throw him in a well.

16:44.982 --> 16:46.316
If he starves to death,
it's not our fault.

16:46.317 --> 16:47.551
I'm gonna go find Bonnie.

16:47.552 --> 16:49.152
We've got a lead
on the cure, Damon.

16:49.153 --> 16:50.721
I'm gonna find
I but I suppose you don't mind.

16:50.722 --> 16:53.357
You never wanted Elena to
be human again, anyway.

16:53.358 --> 16:56.193
I wanted that cure for her
because it's what she wanted.

16:56.194 --> 16:57.594
You might think
I'm afraid to go back,

16:57.595 --> 16:59.763
but I'm not because
I know what she needs.

16:59.764 --> 17:03.132
She needs me to bring
her best friend home.

17:08.819 --> 17:12.008
We got to get you home if
you're gonna help Silas raise the dead.

17:12.009 --> 17:13.844
I don't understand
what I can do.

17:13.845 --> 17:15.512
Well, Silas
can't do magic.

17:15.512 --> 17:18.013
He was a witch, but after
he became immortal, that ended.

17:18.015 --> 17:19.816
He can be a witch or a vampire,
but never both.

17:19.817 --> 17:21.550
That's why I've been
teaching you expressions,

17:21.551 --> 17:22.786
so you can do
his work for him.

17:22.787 --> 17:26.723
What? How?

17:26.723 --> 17:28.992
Using the power
of 3 massacres.

17:28.993 --> 17:33.397
Each massacre of 12
marks the earth with power,

17:33.398 --> 17:37.267
and you can use expression
to tap into that power.

17:37.268 --> 17:38.502
3?

17:38.503 --> 17:39.803
You've had
36 people killed?

17:39.804 --> 17:41.772
No. I've had
24 people killed...

17:41.773 --> 17:43.340
12 humans at the Young farm,
12 hybrids.

17:43.341 --> 17:44.875
You and I are gonna
complete the triangle.

17:44.876 --> 17:46.476
- We're what?
- Look.

17:46.477 --> 17:47.978
There needs to be another massacre,
but it's ok.

17:47.979 --> 17:49.346
They're gonna come back.
It's worth it.

17:49.347 --> 17:50.881
I'm not helping you
kill 12 people, Shane.

17:50.882 --> 17:54.050
Won't you if it meant
you can see Jeremy again,

17:54.051 --> 17:55.886
your grams,

17:55.887 --> 17:59.689
everybody you and
your friends ever lost?

17:59.690 --> 18:02.926
I think you would.

18:02.927 --> 18:06.061
No.

18:09.933 --> 18:12.369
Bonnie?
Jeremy?

18:12.370 --> 18:13.737
It hurts.
Jeremy.

18:13.738 --> 18:15.972
Help me. I can help you.
I'll help you.

18:15.973 --> 18:19.109
I can help you.

18:38.995 --> 18:40.529
No.

18:46.625 --> 18:50.006
He asked you to help
him, didn't he?

18:50.007 --> 18:52.943
He needs your help.

18:52.944 --> 18:55.911
You can do this,
Bonnie.

18:57.498 --> 18:59.415
You know you can.

19:00.984 --> 19:03.118
I'll do
whatever it takes.

19:15.355 --> 19:17.133
I'm bumping the AC.

19:17.134 --> 19:19.336
We're not gonna be able to leave
him in there for much longer.

19:19.337 --> 19:21.337
Yeah. I know.

19:23.073 --> 19:26.676
I've been alive for
almost two centuries now.

19:26.677 --> 19:29.346
You'd think with the amount
of people that I've seen die,

19:29.347 --> 19:33.316
it would hurt less
each time.

19:33.317 --> 19:35.252
Never does.

19:35.253 --> 19:40.023
No. No.
It never does.

19:40.024 --> 19:42.158
I see this
every day.

19:42.159 --> 19:45.629
Sometimes I think that denial is
the worst part for people like us

19:45.630 --> 19:47.430
because we
know the truth.

19:47.431 --> 19:50.433
We can see they're on
a collision course with it,

19:50.434 --> 19:54.971
and all we can do is brace
ourselves for impact.

20:00.678 --> 20:01.945
Did you find her?

20:01.946 --> 20:03.613
I'm still looking.
How is she?

20:03.614 --> 20:04.948
She's losing it,
Damon.

20:04.949 --> 20:06.616
We can do what we can
to delay things here,

20:06.617 --> 20:08.818
but we got to get Jeremy to
the morgue before it gets ugly.

20:08.819 --> 20:09.986
Damn it.

20:09.987 --> 20:11.488
I can't just
leave her behind.

20:11.489 --> 20:13.723
I can't show up
without Bonnie.

20:13.724 --> 20:14.958
I think you have to.

20:14.959 --> 20:16.760
At this point,
the sire bond

20:16.761 --> 20:18.328
is probably the only thing
that's gonna keep Elena together.

20:18.329 --> 20:20.195
I can go back
to find Bonnie.

20:22.866 --> 20:25.100
I'm on my way.

20:41.084 --> 20:44.820
I could actually
hug you right now.

20:46.745 --> 20:50.360
Where have you been?
How'd you find me?

20:50.361 --> 20:52.562
Shane led the way.

20:52.563 --> 20:56.666
He told me
what to do, Damon.

20:56.667 --> 20:59.935
I know how to bring
Jeremy back.

21:14.018 --> 21:16.386
You brought me
to the stoner pit?

21:17.254 --> 21:19.956
I want you
to see something.

21:25.462 --> 21:27.865
Vicki.

21:27.866 --> 21:30.734
Remember when Jer
was so into my sister?

21:30.735 --> 21:34.305
When our parents died.
It was his rebel phase.

21:34.306 --> 21:36.941
I found this
after Vick died.

21:36.942 --> 21:39.109
It made me smile...

21:39.110 --> 21:41.177
And this.

21:45.816 --> 21:49.085
Jeremy and Vicky.
Did he do that?

21:51.121 --> 21:53.290
After they found
Vick's body,

21:53.291 --> 21:56.160
I remember thinking that
things didn't feel over,

21:56.161 --> 21:58.629
you know, that there
was no possible way

21:58.630 --> 22:01.098
that she could be
gone forever.

22:01.099 --> 22:03.367
Then she wasn't.

22:03.368 --> 22:07.504
My point is, this town,

22:07.505 --> 22:09.406
this crazy-ass world
we live in,

22:09.407 --> 22:12.109
sometimes not being willing
to accept that someone is gone

22:12.110 --> 22:15.980
is because
maybe they're not...

22:15.981 --> 22:19.950
At least not completely.

22:19.951 --> 22:23.020
Is that really
what you believe?

22:23.021 --> 22:24.488
Yes.

22:24.489 --> 22:25.990
If I compelled you
to tell me the truth,

22:25.991 --> 22:28.859
is that what
you would say?

22:28.860 --> 22:33.096
I would tell you that
it's ok to have hope...

22:35.132 --> 22:39.235
Because sometimes that's
all that keeps me going.

22:41.705 --> 22:43.406
Thanks, Matt.

22:51.449 --> 22:52.783
- Stefan?
- Hey.

22:52.784 --> 22:54.551
Damon found Bonnie.

22:54.552 --> 22:55.986
The plane is there waiting for
them when they get off the island.

22:55.987 --> 22:57.388
They'll be home
in a few hours.

22:57.389 --> 22:59.323
- Thank God. Is she ok?
- Yeah.

22:59.324 --> 23:01.659
He said she's fine.
Listen, Elena.

23:01.660 --> 23:04.128
You might have been right.
There might be something.

23:04.129 --> 23:06.430
She knows what
to do, doesn't she?

23:06.431 --> 23:08.766
Let's just see what she says
when she gets home, ok?

23:08.767 --> 23:10.334
Ok. We'll be
home soon.

23:14.371 --> 23:17.474
Uh! Ha ha!

23:17.475 --> 23:21.879
You know,
if you're smart,

23:21.880 --> 23:23.747
you'll use the cure
to kill Silas.

23:23.748 --> 23:26.750
Killing Silas is
your supernatural destiny, not mine.

23:26.751 --> 23:28.085
All right. Ok.

23:28.086 --> 23:29.353
Well, you be careful up there,
you know,

23:29.354 --> 23:32.156
because he's up there
running about.

23:32.157 --> 23:34.024
You sure about that?

23:34.025 --> 23:36.759
You don't believe me?
Check my pack.

23:44.134 --> 23:47.004
I found it in the
chamber where he lay.

23:47.005 --> 23:49.173
They say no one
has seen him.

23:49.174 --> 23:52.176
No one knows his face.

23:52.177 --> 23:53.510
How do you hide
from the devil

23:53.511 --> 23:56.947
when you don't know
what he looks like?

23:56.948 --> 23:59.216
Who knows?

23:59.217 --> 24:02.585
Maybe I'm him.

24:04.121 --> 24:06.390
Mark my words,

24:06.391 --> 24:08.559
if you don't use
the cure to kill him,

24:08.560 --> 24:11.595
doesn't matter if you're
human or vampire.

24:11.596 --> 24:14.731
You're doomed.

24:15.699 --> 24:18.234
We all are.

24:19.770 --> 24:21.105
Good luck
to you, Lass.

24:21.106 --> 24:23.207
You've all brought this
upon yourselves.

24:23.208 --> 24:28.112
May you rot in it!
Ha ha ha!

24:28.113 --> 24:30.814
Tyler, it's me again.

24:30.815 --> 24:32.683
So I was thinking about it,

24:32.684 --> 24:34.351
and you probably
ditched your phone,

24:34.352 --> 24:36.019
which is the smartest thing
that you could do.

24:36.020 --> 24:37.921
So I don't know
when you're gonna get this,

24:37.922 --> 24:40.624
but things were looking
kind of bleak for a minute,

24:40.625 --> 24:42.526
and... I don't know...
Maybe they're turning around.

24:42.527 --> 24:44.495
So when you get this,
call me back,

24:44.496 --> 24:46.230
and I'll tell you everything.

24:49.501 --> 24:51.435
Thank God.

24:51.436 --> 24:55.739
We were
so, so worried.

24:55.740 --> 24:57.441
I'm ok.

24:57.442 --> 25:00.110
Could you get
Stefan out here?

25:00.111 --> 25:01.779
They said that she
knows what to do.

25:01.780 --> 25:05.648
Caroline, I need to
talk to my brother.

25:07.084 --> 25:08.785
What's wrong?

25:10.821 --> 25:13.724
I'll do
whatever it takes.

25:13.725 --> 25:17.227
Whatever you ask of me,
I'll do.

25:17.228 --> 25:21.098
Then you will
see him again.

25:21.099 --> 25:23.967
There's just a few things
we have to do first.

25:23.968 --> 25:25.736
It's called
an expression triangle.

25:25.737 --> 25:28.806
I need to complete it
for Silas.

25:28.807 --> 25:30.140
What?

25:30.141 --> 25:31.742
She's out of her
mind, Stefan.

25:31.743 --> 25:33.911
The nutty Professor has got
her totally brainwashed.

25:33.912 --> 25:36.079
Bonnie,
you can't kill 12 people.

25:36.080 --> 25:39.283
I know it sounds crazy, but it's
the only way to get enough power.

25:39.284 --> 25:40.784
To do what?

25:40.785 --> 25:42.553
When Silas was buried
by the witch Qetsiyah,

25:42.554 --> 25:44.621
she left him with the cure
and two choices...

25:44.622 --> 25:46.323
Stay mortal and rot
or take the cure

25:46.324 --> 25:47.791
and eventually die
in there of old age.

25:47.792 --> 25:49.993
He's been trapped
in there for 2,000 years.

25:49.994 --> 25:51.461
At some point,
wouldn't death

25:51.462 --> 25:53.163
by old age
have been better?

25:53.164 --> 25:55.032
No, because, you see,
Qetsiyah had already one-upped him.

25:55.033 --> 25:56.633
She knew that
he wanted to die

25:56.634 --> 25:58.435
so that he could
find peace,

25:58.436 --> 26:02.506
be reunited with
his one true love.

26:02.507 --> 26:05.275
So she created
the other side

26:05.276 --> 26:08.145
as a purgatory for all
supernatural beings,

26:08.146 --> 26:09.513
ensuring
that if he died,

26:09.514 --> 26:11.148
he'd end up
there forever.

26:11.149 --> 26:14.117
- That's where you come in.
- Why me?

26:14.118 --> 26:15.986
Because you, as
Qetsiyah's descendant

26:15.987 --> 26:18.589
can make the other
side go away.

26:18.590 --> 26:20.023
How?

26:20.024 --> 26:21.491
I mean, the whole
flight back home,

26:21.492 --> 26:23.260
all she could talk about
was how she's the one

26:23.261 --> 26:26.063
that can drop the veil between
this side and the other side.

26:26.064 --> 26:27.564
Drop the veil?
What does that even mean?

26:27.565 --> 26:29.466
What it means is,
the myth about Silas

26:29.467 --> 26:30.868
being able
to raise the dead

26:30.869 --> 26:32.736
is not just one
or some.

26:32.737 --> 26:35.305
It's every supernatural
being over there.

26:35.306 --> 26:37.875
Once the veil is dropped,
the other side doesn't exist anymore.

26:37.876 --> 26:40.544
There's nothing separating us.
We're all just one.

26:40.545 --> 26:42.379
3 massacres,
3 hot spots,

26:42.380 --> 26:44.448
and the witch spell
of the century,

26:44.449 --> 26:47.351
every supernatural being over
there is back with a vengeance.

26:47.352 --> 26:49.319
- I can't do that.
- What? Oh, no.

26:49.320 --> 26:51.188
Yes, you can.
Yes, you can.

26:51.189 --> 26:52.990
All the witches,
your ancestors,

26:52.991 --> 26:54.758
who've been persecuted
throughout time,

26:54.759 --> 26:59.196
your grams, Jeremy,
they'll all be back.

26:59.197 --> 27:00.963
You can do this.

27:02.733 --> 27:07.004
You will do this.

27:07.005 --> 27:09.940
Bonnie, you are
talking like a crazy person.

27:09.941 --> 27:13.243
You are not killing
12 people,

27:13.244 --> 27:15.545
and you sure as hell
can't invite every monster

27:15.546 --> 27:17.547
who has ever died
back into this world.

27:17.548 --> 27:19.116
Caroline, I think
she knows that.

27:19.117 --> 27:21.518
No. I can do it.
I have the power.

27:21.519 --> 27:23.787
I can bring
everyone back...

27:23.788 --> 27:26.556
Jeremy, Alaric,
Vicki.

27:26.557 --> 27:29.592
Bonnie, stop it.
You can't just say these things.

27:37.568 --> 27:38.635
I'll get it.

27:38.636 --> 27:39.736
Hey, look.
I'll get it.

27:39.737 --> 27:42.105
I said I'll get it.

27:47.244 --> 27:49.046
Hello?

27:49.047 --> 27:51.782
Elena, hey.
It's April... Young.

27:51.783 --> 27:54.051
I was looking for Jeremy,

27:54.052 --> 27:57.754
and his cell phone keeps
going straight to voicemail.

27:57.755 --> 27:59.523
Jeremy can't come
to the phone right now.

27:59.524 --> 28:02.960
He's not...

28:02.961 --> 28:06.729
I'm sorry. He's dead.

29:25.760 --> 29:27.094
Elena...

29:30.498 --> 29:32.633
He's dead.

29:35.937 --> 29:38.573
He's dead.

29:38.574 --> 29:40.241
Damon, he's dead,

29:40.242 --> 29:42.810
and he's been dead
this entire time,

29:42.811 --> 29:44.712
and I...

29:44.713 --> 29:46.880
Oh, my God.

29:48.816 --> 29:50.685
I can smell him.

29:50.686 --> 29:52.320
How long has he
smelled like that?

29:52.321 --> 29:54.355
Hey, talk to me.
I can help you.

29:54.356 --> 29:58.993
How? How are you
gonna help me? How?

30:00.229 --> 30:01.529
Ok. Ok.

30:01.530 --> 30:04.732
We have to take care
of his body.

30:04.733 --> 30:06.401
- Bring him downstairs.
- We shouldn't...

30:06.402 --> 30:08.936
Just carry him
down, please.

30:15.945 --> 30:17.779
Where's Bonnie?

30:17.780 --> 30:20.048
We told Matt to take her home.
We thought it'd be best.

30:20.049 --> 30:22.684
Ok. Guess we're gonna have to
do this the old-fashioned way.

30:22.685 --> 30:25.420
- Do what?
- Put his body on the couch.

30:25.421 --> 30:28.056
Elena?

30:28.057 --> 30:33.027
Elena, you need help
finding something?

30:33.028 --> 30:34.796
Got it.

30:34.797 --> 30:36.431
What are you doing?

30:36.432 --> 30:38.433
We need a cover story,
right?

30:38.434 --> 30:40.134
You think I didn't hear you guys
talking earlier?

30:40.135 --> 30:43.137
Well, what are we gonna say...
Animal attack,

30:43.138 --> 30:44.639
tumble down the stairs?

30:44.640 --> 30:47.275
No. We burn the house down
with him inside of it.

30:47.276 --> 30:48.576
Elena, stop it.

30:48.577 --> 30:51.279
Why, because you want me
to not be in denial?

30:51.280 --> 30:52.647
You want me
to face the truth?

30:52.648 --> 30:54.415
This is
the truth, Stefan.

30:54.416 --> 30:56.751
I don't want to live
here anymore.

30:56.752 --> 30:59.053
I don't want
these sketches.

30:59.054 --> 31:01.288
I don't want this Xbox.

31:03.124 --> 31:05.660
Not gonna need
this bourbon anymore.

31:05.661 --> 31:07.328
Alaric is not here
to drink it, I mean,

31:07.329 --> 31:09.097
unless you guys are
willing to bring back

31:09.098 --> 31:12.400
every supernatural creature on
the other side to get him hick.

31:12.401 --> 31:13.701
Would you?

31:13.702 --> 31:16.971
I know you want your
drinking buddy back.

31:16.972 --> 31:19.407
Would you, Damon?

31:19.408 --> 31:22.509
Because I wouldn't.

31:23.845 --> 31:25.046
I don't know.

31:25.047 --> 31:27.248
I mean, does that make me
a bad person?

31:27.249 --> 31:31.185
I have no idea.

31:31.186 --> 31:32.520
He's not gonna need that
anymore.

31:32.521 --> 31:34.355
Elena, stop it.
You're scaring me.

31:34.356 --> 31:36.924
What else are we supposed to
do with the body, Caroline?

31:36.925 --> 31:40.495
I mean, there's no room in
the Gilbert family plot.

31:40.496 --> 31:43.564
Jenna and John took
the last spots.

31:43.565 --> 31:45.166
No, no, Elena. Stop.

31:45.167 --> 31:48.136
There's nothing here
for me anymore, Stefan.

31:48.137 --> 31:52.106
Every inch of this house
is filled with memories

31:52.107 --> 31:54.809
of the people that
I love that have died...

31:54.810 --> 31:59.814
My mom, my dad, Jeremy,
and Jenna and Alaric,

31:59.815 --> 32:01.349
John, even John.

32:01.350 --> 32:03.317
I mean, they're all dead.
Everyone is dead.

32:03.318 --> 32:04.819
So what am I
supposed to...

32:04.820 --> 32:06.020
I mean, how am I
gonna...

32:06.021 --> 32:07.321
I can't even...

32:07.322 --> 32:10.591
There's nothing
left for me. Aah!

32:11.994 --> 32:14.328
- Elena, I need you to calm down.
- No, no, no.

32:14.329 --> 32:17.165
I can't. I can't.
I can't. I...

32:17.166 --> 32:20.501
I can't.
I can't.

32:20.502 --> 32:25.740
No. It hurts. It hurts.
Just make it stop.

32:25.741 --> 32:29.210
Please make it stop.
It hurts. Ah...

32:29.211 --> 32:31.612
Damon...

32:31.613 --> 32:34.048
Help her.

32:38.619 --> 32:41.456
I... I...

32:43.258 --> 32:45.026
I can help you.

32:45.027 --> 32:46.927
I want you
to let me help you.

32:54.969 --> 32:58.072
I can help you.

32:58.073 --> 33:00.574
How?

33:02.577 --> 33:04.278
Turn it off.

33:04.279 --> 33:06.881
What? No, no.

33:06.882 --> 33:09.784
Just turn it off,

33:09.785 --> 33:13.788
and everything
will go away.

33:13.789 --> 33:17.191
That's what
you have to do.

33:17.192 --> 33:20.060
It's what
I want you to do.

33:24.665 --> 33:27.267
Just turn it off.

34:06.667 --> 34:08.936
Hey, it's me. Look.

34:08.937 --> 34:11.339
I hate to leave this
on your voicemail,

34:11.340 --> 34:14.741
but I think that
you need to know.

34:17.344 --> 34:21.482
Jeremy is dead, Tyler.
I'm so sorry.

34:21.483 --> 34:24.217
I thought that you would call
and I could tell you,

34:24.219 --> 34:27.188
but then you didn't, so...

34:27.188 --> 34:30.157
Just call me
when you get this, ok?

34:31.893 --> 34:34.661
I need you,

34:34.663 --> 34:36.531
and there's no way that
yesterday was the last time

34:36.532 --> 34:39.433
that I'm ever going to see you
or talk to you.

34:39.434 --> 34:44.603
It can't be.
So just... Call me, Tyler.

34:46.706 --> 34:49.744
Please.

35:03.424 --> 35:08.196
It's gonna be ok, Matt,
you'll see.

35:08.197 --> 35:10.998
I'll bring him back.

35:10.999 --> 35:13.867
Get some sleep, Bon.
We can talk tomorrow.

35:30.218 --> 35:32.886
Did you tell them?

35:35.323 --> 35:37.058
They don't think
I can do it.

35:37.059 --> 35:41.963
Oh, they're just scared.
They're afraid to believe.

35:41.964 --> 35:43.864
You know,
I've been thinking.

35:43.865 --> 35:46.067
You said if I dropped
the veil to the other side,

35:46.068 --> 35:48.002
that the dead'll return,

35:48.003 --> 35:49.537
but that's only
for the supernatural.

35:49.538 --> 35:52.873
What about the 12 people
that died on the Young farm?

35:52.874 --> 35:56.611
They were
a necessary sacrifice

35:56.612 --> 35:58.846
for the greater good.

35:58.847 --> 36:01.549
They've passed on.
They've found peace.

36:01.550 --> 36:04.285
It's all anyone wants.

36:04.286 --> 36:05.752
That's all Silas wants.

36:07.855 --> 36:11.725
We'll do this together,
you and I.

36:13.594 --> 36:17.330
We are the beginning.

36:40.289 --> 36:42.355
Blast it.

36:57.138 --> 36:59.673
Shane.

37:13.120 --> 37:14.321
Aah!

37:16.924 --> 37:19.125
Silas.

38:25.292 --> 38:27.228
It was a mistake.

38:27.229 --> 38:29.530
It wasn't,
and you know it.

38:29.531 --> 38:31.699
This is the only way
she's gonna survive.

38:31.700 --> 38:33.601
We'll help her,
keep an eye on her.

38:33.602 --> 38:35.503
When she's ready, I'll use
the sire bond to bring her back.

38:35.504 --> 38:38.139
Her humanity, Damon,
it was all she had left.

38:38.140 --> 38:39.640
Humanity means nothing
when you don't have

38:39.641 --> 38:42.675
anyone to care
about, Stefan.

38:44.078 --> 38:46.379
She had you.

38:49.583 --> 38:51.384
She lost
her brother.

38:53.988 --> 38:58.191
I'm not enough,
not this time.

39:03.898 --> 39:06.600
Listen, Damon.

39:06.601 --> 39:10.271
I know that you and I,
we've been through some...

39:10.272 --> 39:13.007
Bad spots lately,

39:13.008 --> 39:15.676
especially
when it comes to her.

39:15.677 --> 39:18.512
Yeah. Well...

39:18.513 --> 39:21.815
Guess none of that
matters anymore.

39:25.920 --> 39:28.321
I just, um...

39:30.624 --> 39:34.427
I want you to know
that, um...

39:38.899 --> 39:41.434
I know, Stefan.

40:15.269 --> 40:19.106
Elena, don't do this.

40:19.107 --> 40:23.077
We can find
another cover story.

40:23.078 --> 40:25.179
This is the best one.

40:25.180 --> 40:27.982
No one'll ask questions.

40:27.983 --> 40:33.287
Ok. If you burn down the house,
it'll be gone.

40:33.288 --> 40:36.090
What if one day
when this is all over,

40:36.091 --> 40:39.259
you want to come home again?

40:43.197 --> 40:45.298
I won't.
