"Apartment For Rent
Furnished Spacious Loft $ 700"

02:01.888 --> 02:03.688
MANAGER

02:04.990 --> 02:06.237
Here you go.

02:06.272 --> 02:09.090
Well, the furniture's not new
but it's in pretty good shape.

02:09.094 --> 02:10.753
And it's just been steamed today.

02:11.595 --> 02:14.308
- It's beautiful!
- Yes it is.

02:16.264 --> 02:20.404
The morning sun can be pretty intense,
especially if you're a night owl like me.

02:20.987 --> 02:24.202
No, no, I'm a morning person.
Best light for painting.

02:24.237 --> 02:25.185
You an artist?

02:25.486 --> 02:27.642
Well that's what I'm here to find out.

02:27.843 --> 02:29.638
Well, then this place
is perfect for you.

02:29.939 --> 02:31.600
Quiet building...
Nice neighborhood...

02:32.801 --> 02:35.986
A fairly nice neighborhood...
considering the area.

02:36.316 --> 02:37.151
Besides,

02:37.252 --> 02:39.892
you got me.
Right next door.

02:43.645 --> 02:44.645
Yeah...

02:45.340 --> 02:46.458
So...

02:47.048 --> 02:49.760
The bathroom is over
here behind the stairs.

02:50.005 --> 02:53.617
And the bedroom is
right upstairs in the loft.

03:12.730 --> 03:14.725
Is this the only closet?

03:15.426 --> 03:17.220
Yeah, I'm afraid it is.

03:23.830 --> 03:26.485
This... used to be a real wood
burning fire place here...

03:26.687 --> 03:28.382
but now it just operates on gas.

03:28.483 --> 03:30.509
You know...
no fuss no muss, huh?

03:32.110 --> 03:32.945
I'll take it!

03:33.313 --> 03:35.504
Great!
When would you like to move in?

03:35.705 --> 03:36.705
Next week?

03:37.106 --> 03:38.207
That soon?

03:38.608 --> 03:42.798
Okay well, you can sign the lease
now and Elaine can sign it tonight.

03:43.061 --> 03:44.721
- Elaine?
- My wife.

03:44.857 --> 03:47.183
She's the one that
actually owns the building.

03:47.584 --> 03:49.145
And I guess should warn you...

03:49.181 --> 03:51.897
She's a bit... eccentric.

03:53.708 --> 03:56.027
- What do you mean?
- Oh!  She's harmless...

03:56.076 --> 03:58.534
It's just that she still
thinks that it's 1969.

03:59.303 --> 04:00.821
You still want to move in?

04:01.635 --> 04:02.970
I... yeah!

04:03.071 --> 04:05.308
Well then.  Welcome, neighbor.

04:05.498 --> 04:06.498
What's your name?

04:06.999 --> 04:08.000
Paige Benedict.

04:08.101 --> 04:10.293
Paige... well, I'm
Jonas Lowrey.

04:10.394 --> 04:14.440
If you need anything, you
call me... day or night.

04:14.851 --> 04:17.564
I think I'll be fine.
Thanks.

05:01.677 --> 05:02.877
Oolaa...

05:02.978 --> 05:06.521
You're the new girl in unit "C" right?

05:06.622 --> 05:09.645
Yeah, and you must be Jonah's wife.

05:10.246 --> 05:11.388
How did you know that?

05:12.190 --> 05:13.490
Lucky guess.

05:14.949 --> 05:16.392
Elaine Lowrey.

05:17.593 --> 05:19.093
Paige Benedict.

05:19.695 --> 05:21.247
And this is  Doo.

05:22.396 --> 05:24.689
Far out!
He likes you.

05:26.290 --> 05:27.591
Oh boy!

05:31.393 --> 05:33.785
I named him after the song...

05:34.987 --> 05:36.229
The song?

05:36.897 --> 05:39.916
You know?  Me and you
and a dog named "Doo".

05:40.217 --> 05:44.337
Well, I think the song is
"Me, you and a dog named Boo".

05:45.445 --> 05:46.480
What...?

05:46.781 --> 05:47.881
No...

05:48.582 --> 05:52.759
Who name their dog "Boo".
That's a a stupid name.

05:52.771 --> 05:55.654
Isn't it, baby?
Yes it is.

05:59.490 --> 06:02.339
Wow, that looks like it weighs a ton.

06:03.340 --> 06:05.210
Yeah.  Feels like it too.

06:06.272 --> 06:09.740
What are you standing here
rapping with me for?

06:09.775 --> 06:12.711
Get it inside before
it breaks your back.

06:13.967 --> 06:16.558
Good idea!
Thanks.

06:50.746 --> 06:53.995
Get a grip, Paige.
It's only a Ouija board.

07:29.139 --> 07:31.265
Okay!
The phones all hooked up.

07:31.366 --> 07:33.556
You got any cold beers in there?

07:35.558 --> 07:36.658
No.

07:36.793 --> 07:38.251
All I got is a coke.

07:38.286 --> 07:39.920
Oh!  That's all you got.

08:01.627 --> 08:02.662
Hello!

08:02.762 --> 08:04.220
Anybody home?

08:05.928 --> 08:07.428
YES

08:35.837 --> 08:36.937
Hello?

08:38.339 --> 08:40.104
Is there anybody there?

08:43.541 --> 08:44.741
Hello?

08:46.943 --> 08:48.739
Is there somebody here?

08:52.708 --> 08:54.963
Oh my God!
These things really work?

08:54.970 --> 08:56.165
YES

08:59.967 --> 09:01.267
Who are you?

09:02.700 --> 09:05.472
S... U...

09:06.062 --> 09:06.897
S...

09:07.399 --> 09:08.399
A...

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
N...

09:11.302 --> 09:12.602
Susan!

09:12.868 --> 09:14.003
YES

09:14.504 --> 09:15.605
Hi Susan,

09:15.606 --> 09:16.906
I'm... I'm Paige.

09:18.207 --> 09:19.508
Hello

09:20.009 --> 09:21.309
What are you doing here?

09:23.411 --> 09:26.210
P... R...

09:27.303 --> 09:28.238
O...

09:28.636 --> 09:29.571
M...

09:29.973 --> 09:30.908
O...

09:34.010 --> 09:35.210
A promo ...?

09:37.111 --> 09:38.412
A promotion!

09:39.413 --> 09:41.539
You know about the promotion?

09:42.640 --> 09:44.040
Am I going to get it?

09:46.642 --> 09:47.942
Susan?

09:50.744 --> 09:52.209
GOODBYE

09:58.712 --> 10:00.013
Sorry.

10:00.014 --> 10:01.653
I didn't mean to startle you.

10:02.612 --> 10:05.938
Mitch, what are you doing here?

10:06.497 --> 10:07.840
You forgot this.

10:07.841 --> 10:10.254
I thought you might
need it for your CPA exam.

10:11.656 --> 10:13.251
And really, Paige...

10:13.252 --> 10:14.352
the question is...

10:14.888 --> 10:16.853
What are you doing here?

10:17.355 --> 10:19.416
I mean... look at this place,
it's a dump.

10:21.017 --> 10:22.813
It's an artist loft...

10:23.281 --> 10:25.482
And living here is going
to make you an artist...

10:27.410 --> 10:29.164
I am an artist!

10:29.241 --> 10:30.277
Why?

10:30.278 --> 10:32.598
Because you did a couple of
drawings when you were a kid?

10:32.599 --> 10:34.130
You know, if you really
wanted to paint, Paige,

10:34.131 --> 10:35.857
you could have just set
your stuff up in the garage.

10:35.958 --> 10:37.624
You didn't have to move out.

10:39.359 --> 10:40.824
You don't understand...

10:42.127 --> 10:43.392
Yeah, you're right, I don't understand.

10:43.393 --> 10:45.124
Why don't you explain it to me?

10:45.592 --> 10:48.510
I tried to...
You wouldn't listen.

10:48.812 --> 10:50.543
Well, I'm all ears now.

10:52.209 --> 10:53.609
Mitch... I...

10:54.210 --> 10:56.436
I can't do this anymore.
I'm sorry.

10:58.237 --> 10:59.437
Can't do what?

10:59.539 --> 11:00.804
Mitch, please!

11:00.805 --> 11:01.970
Talk to me, Paige!

11:01.971 --> 11:05.315
- I can't!
- Just talk to me, God dammit!

11:05.716 --> 11:07.216
Excuse me.

11:11.419 --> 11:13.779
Is everything alright in here?

11:16.881 --> 11:19.352
Yes, everything's fine.

11:22.739 --> 11:23.539
You know, man...

11:23.540 --> 11:26.031
maybe you should go find yourself
some business or something...

11:26.032 --> 11:28.227
because right now
you're in mine, okay?

11:28.328 --> 11:29.429
Well...

11:30.330 --> 11:33.171
Actually this is my business.

11:34.816 --> 11:36.547
You see, my sister
owns the building...

11:36.576 --> 11:39.900
And , I'm pretty
sure she has a policy

11:39.906 --> 11:42.334
against her tenants being harassed.

11:42.768 --> 11:43.868
So?

11:44.169 --> 11:45.270
So.

11:47.271 --> 11:50.127
You're not really going to
make me call the police, are you?

12:02.631 --> 12:04.232
I am the police.

12:19.737 --> 12:21.000
Are you still here?

12:21.138 --> 12:23.164
25-O-5,
Right?

12:24.165 --> 12:25.365
What?

12:25.366 --> 12:26.667
Your badge number.

12:26.802 --> 12:28.827
I just want to make
sure I had it right.

12:28.828 --> 12:30.159
So, when you call your superiors

12:30.160 --> 12:31.460
so I can tell 'em...

12:31.495 --> 12:34.874
what great work you're doing
for public relations down here!

13:05.923 --> 13:07.224
Thanks.

13:09.625 --> 13:12.674
- Russell Upton.
- Paige Benedict.

13:13.575 --> 13:16.294
You must have a whole hell
a lot of unpaid parking fines...

13:17.595 --> 13:20.186
No... he's my ex-boyfriend.

13:23.298 --> 13:25.158
MENTONE & SONS
ACCOUNTING FIRM

13:38.263 --> 13:39.463
Carla?

13:40.465 --> 13:42.065
Wait.
Hold on a second.

13:45.301 --> 13:47.985
Have you seen my books
for the Eden account?

13:48.151 --> 13:52.273
I left them on Henry's desk
last night but he can't find them.

13:52.839 --> 13:54.634
Why are you asking me?

13:56.736 --> 13:58.036
Well I... am...

13:58.737 --> 14:00.533
you were the last one in there.

14:02.902 --> 14:05.722
George, I'll call you back.
Okay.

14:09.066 --> 14:10.732
What are you accusing me of?

14:12.233 --> 14:13.233
Nothing...

14:13.334 --> 14:15.235
I. .. I just... um

14:16.436 --> 14:17.440
Well you know...

14:17.441 --> 14:21.912
we're both up for this
CPA position, and I...

14:23.813 --> 14:25.213
Listen to me, Paige...

14:25.715 --> 14:28.220
Do you really think I
need steal your work

14:28.221 --> 14:30.317
in order to beat you
out of this promotion?

14:31.418 --> 14:32.453
No!

14:33.055 --> 14:36.626
I don't... know...

14:36.713 --> 14:37.948
I guess not.

14:38.149 --> 14:40.244
Then why don't you go and
look for it somewhere else?

14:49.953 --> 14:51.188
Oolaa!

14:51.490 --> 14:54.402
Have you met any of
the other tenants yet?

14:54.437 --> 14:55.347
No... not yet.

14:56.348 --> 14:58.373
What about the guys behind you?

14:58.608 --> 15:01.429
You haven't heard any strange noises?

15:02.831 --> 15:05.019
Oh, what do you mean?

15:05.232 --> 15:06.633
Well.

15:06.934 --> 15:08.959
They claim they're just roommates,

15:08.960 --> 15:11.029
but I have my doubts.

15:11.352 --> 15:13.147
Not that I would
say anything though

15:13.148 --> 15:15.139
because like I don't dig gossip.

15:15.850 --> 15:17.911
Not like Wanda Esbell.

15:19.012 --> 15:20.112
Who?

15:20.413 --> 15:22.533
The writer in unit "B".

15:24.110 --> 15:25.372
Never smiles.

15:26.279 --> 15:28.912
Never sets foot out of her apartment.

15:29.171 --> 15:33.215
Never has a pleasant thing
to say about anybody.

15:34.916 --> 15:37.637
You know everyone in
this building, don't you?

15:39.308 --> 15:41.381
I am the landlady.

15:41.937 --> 15:44.578
Did you ever know anyone named Susan?

15:46.272 --> 15:48.938
You mean Susan Sidney?

15:49.064 --> 15:51.444
I. .. I don't know.
Or maybe ...

15:51.445 --> 15:53.297
Did she use to live here?

15:53.698 --> 15:56.040
Two years ago.
Why?

15:56.053 --> 15:58.755
I found a Ouija board in the closet...

16:03.558 --> 16:04.652
Hi, Paige!

16:04.701 --> 16:07.320
- Get settle in okay?
- Oh yeah, thanks.

16:09.005 --> 16:11.278
Oh, Christ!
I'm sorry about that.

16:12.207 --> 16:13.738
Oh, it's okay.

16:13.925 --> 16:16.107
Listen, I'm the handyman around here.

16:16.110 --> 16:17.523
So if you ever need anything,

16:17.674 --> 16:19.746
and I mean anything,

16:19.747 --> 16:21.188
just let me know.

16:21.539 --> 16:23.429
Ahhh... thanks.

16:24.282 --> 16:27.495
You're making a fool
of yourself, Jonas.

16:29.597 --> 16:30.897
Come on.

16:30.956 --> 16:33.769
The shower drain is clogged again.

16:33.770 --> 16:36.531
It's because you keep washing
your goddamn mud in there.

16:36.732 --> 16:39.314
Well, I have to clean him, don't I?

16:39.315 --> 16:41.378
Well, hose him off in the backyard.

16:41.433 --> 16:43.305
He's a dog, for Christ sakes!

16:44.107 --> 16:46.409
Shhh!  He's sensitive...

16:46.708 --> 16:51.081
You know he doesn't
dig being called a D-O-G.

16:52.173 --> 16:53.215
Come on, Doo,

16:53.216 --> 16:55.509
Mommy and Daddy are going upstairs.

16:55.610 --> 16:58.623
Elaine, you get way too
many drugs and weird stuff.

18:09.130 --> 18:12.013
Russel!  Are you crazy?
You nearly scared me to death!

18:12.295 --> 18:14.535
Yeah.
My death.

18:17.441 --> 18:19.172
I'm... I'm... I'm
so sorry.

18:19.243 --> 18:20.671
God I'm sorry...

18:21.846 --> 18:23.906
Oh God, it must have hurt.

18:24.746 --> 18:26.277
I don't know what came over me.

18:27.178 --> 18:29.074
Is there anything I can do for you?

18:29.375 --> 18:30.575
Yeah!

18:30.876 --> 18:32.176
Kill me!

18:34.678 --> 18:36.078
I'm sorry.

18:36.280 --> 18:38.597
I don't mean to laugh.

18:40.007 --> 18:41.907
Oh here, let me.

18:50.711 --> 18:51.811
There.

18:52.617 --> 18:54.082
How are you feeling now?

18:54.418 --> 18:55.419
Better?

18:55.420 --> 18:57.080
Oh, yeah, yeah!

18:57.681 --> 18:59.508
I always welcome new
tenants by writhing around

18:59.509 --> 19:02.029
in the dust and he's
groaning in agony.

19:03.501 --> 19:05.491
I still can't believe I did that.

19:05.492 --> 19:07.553
I'm usually not that aggressive.

19:08.290 --> 19:09.921
What are you doing
down here, anyway?

19:10.222 --> 19:11.552
Checking the boiler for leaks.

19:12.688 --> 19:14.184
Shouldn't Jonas be doing that?

19:14.985 --> 19:16.580
He is the handyman, isn't he?

19:17.682 --> 19:19.613
I'm the handyman is more like it.

19:25.886 --> 19:27.781
You've got a great
face, you know that?

19:30.084 --> 19:33.154
I'm not coming on to you.
I'm a photographer.

19:35.683 --> 19:38.173
Would you consider
posing for me some time?

19:39.676 --> 19:43.800
I don't think so.
I'd be way too self-conscious.

19:43.817 --> 19:47.716
Okay I don't to push it.
But ...

19:48.376 --> 19:51.509
Here is my card.
In case you change your mind.

19:56.917 --> 19:59.110
Did Susan Sidney pose for you?

19:59.111 --> 20:02.449
- You knew Susan?
- Uh, Elaine mentioned her.

20:03.467 --> 20:04.667
Figures.

20:05.168 --> 20:07.654
There's 3 forms of mass
communication around here.

20:07.660 --> 20:10.481
Telephone, telefax and tell-Elaine.

20:12.465 --> 20:15.126
What was she like?
Susan I mean?

20:15.959 --> 20:20.912
Smart, sexy,
totally independent.

20:21.323 --> 20:22.696
And very tough.

20:22.982 --> 20:26.577
She'd kicked me just like you did,
but she never would have apologized.

20:26.589 --> 20:29.153
So what were you and Elaine
talking about her anyway?

20:29.273 --> 20:33.197
I found a ouija board and
I think it might be hers.

20:33.821 --> 20:34.863
Probably is.

20:35.655 --> 20:38.467
She was really into
all that occult stuff.

20:40.369 --> 20:42.903
And yes, she did pose for me.

23:42.056 --> 23:44.365
I can't believe I'm doing this...

23:44.510 --> 23:45.652
Susan!

23:45.711 --> 23:47.286
Are you still here?

23:50.567 --> 23:51.709
Susan?

23:53.726 --> 23:56.394
Susan, is your last name Sidney?

23:57.110 --> 23:58.353
YES

23:58.912 --> 24:00.200
And, um...

24:00.214 --> 24:01.759
this is your ouija board.

24:02.716 --> 24:03.958
YES

24:05.260 --> 24:06.700
What are you doing here?

24:07.261 --> 24:08.361
A...

24:09.163 --> 24:10.264
R...

24:10.965 --> 24:12.065

24:12.566 --> 24:13.667
I...

24:14.068 --> 24:15.168
S...

24:15.427 --> 24:16.906
T...
Artist?

24:17.041 --> 24:18.480
Are you an artist?

24:20.140 --> 24:21.318
H...

24:22.542 --> 24:23.655
E...

24:24.887 --> 24:26.077
L...

24:26.979 --> 24:28.893
P...
Help?

24:29.961 --> 24:33.402
You need help?
Or you mean you're here to help me?

24:37.938 --> 24:39.081
Susan?

24:42.984 --> 24:44.709
Susan, what do you mean?

25:12.958 --> 25:14.158
Whoa!

25:15.659 --> 25:17.112
Who did that?

25:24.874 --> 25:26.705
Susan, what are you doing?

25:31.397 --> 25:33.150
What the hell...?

27:41.597 --> 27:43.366
Susan!
Are you alright?

27:44.932 --> 27:46.067
E...

27:46.968 --> 27:48.104
D...

27:48.370 --> 27:49.505
E...

27:50.107 --> 27:51.170
N...

27:51.174 --> 27:52.009
Eden?

27:52.210 --> 27:53.860
The Eden account?

27:54.012 --> 27:55.559
You know where my books are?

27:56.143 --> 27:57.278
C...

27:58.446 --> 27:59.581
A...

28:00.982 --> 28:02.083

28:02.749 --> 28:03.884
L...

28:04.185 --> 28:06.735
A...
Carla?

28:10.790 --> 28:12.290
That bitch!

28:41.302 --> 28:43.533
EDEN COSMETICS FISCAL YEAR 1993

28:44.439 --> 28:45.999
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

28:46.001 --> 28:49.690
This is my office, my desk!
How dare you come in here like this.

28:49.794 --> 28:51.988
- And you get out of here before...
- Shut the fuck up.

28:53.296 --> 28:56.756
If you ever...
pull a stunt like this again,

28:57.060 --> 29:00.323
you're going to need a calculator and
count all the teeth you'll be missing.

29:19.294 --> 29:20.819
Hello!
Paige Benedict.

29:20.820 --> 29:22.321
Paige!
It's Mitch.

29:22.922 --> 29:24.714
Listen, I think we should talk.

29:24.854 --> 29:26.354
Mitch, I'm at work.

29:26.555 --> 29:29.249
Well, you wouldn't talk to
me in your apartment, so...

29:29.382 --> 29:31.113
You weren't talking,
you were yelling...

29:31.114 --> 29:33.100
and I'm not putting
up with it anymore.

29:33.111 --> 29:35.485
Damn it, Paige!
Just listen to what I have...!

29:52.409 --> 29:54.410
UPTON PHOTOGRAPHY
Russell Upton

29:58.312 --> 30:00.137
Beautiful, Paige!
... Beautiful!

30:00.538 --> 30:01.739
Now be sexy.

30:02.440 --> 30:04.201
This is the sexiest I can...

30:04.937 --> 30:06.897
Come on!
You're not even trying...

30:08.500 --> 30:10.825
It has nothing to do with trying...

30:11.426 --> 30:14.548
- I'm just not sexy.
- I don't believe it!

30:14.960 --> 30:16.794
Here, lick your lips!

30:19.563 --> 30:21.923
I said lick them, not swallow them.

30:23.626 --> 30:26.504
I'm sorry.
I just feel silly...

30:27.829 --> 30:29.429
That's because you're posing.

30:29.931 --> 30:32.257
Try to be more natural.
Pretend I'm not here.

30:32.258 --> 30:35.362
Oh!
Easier said than done.

30:35.363 --> 30:36.505
Okay

30:36.506 --> 30:39.111
Then, forget the camera.
Just talk.

30:39.161 --> 30:43.084
- Tell me about yourself.
- What do you want to know?

30:43.622 --> 30:47.320
- Whatever you want to tell me.
- Okay.

30:47.326 --> 30:52.601
I'm an only child, born and
raised on a farm in Indiana.

30:52.648 --> 30:57.583
My parents were very
old fashioned and very strict.

30:57.869 --> 31:01.257
- I could have guessed that much.
- How come?

31:01.286 --> 31:05.695
- You dress like Mary Poppins.
- I beg your pardon.

31:05.898 --> 31:08.167
Perfect!
See, there's a natural pose...

31:08.437 --> 31:11.579
Good enough for my
driver's license, I'm sure.

31:14.581 --> 31:16.147
So how long you've
been interested in art?

31:16.372 --> 31:19.144
Oh!  Guys lyings I can remember...

31:19.552 --> 31:24.481
When the other little girls were playing
jump rope, I was doing charcoal sketches.

31:25.071 --> 31:26.753
Then how did you end up an accountant?

31:27.536 --> 31:31.532
Well, I wanted to go to Art School
and become a painter

31:31.793 --> 31:35.085
but my father wanted me to go
to college and study business.

31:35.440 --> 31:39.509
He said a career in art was too risky.

31:40.098 --> 31:44.484
So we compromised.  I went to
college and studied business.

31:45.666 --> 31:47.673
You always do what your father wants?

31:47.936 --> 31:50.109
Until he died last year.

31:50.410 --> 31:52.802
And then I decided to do what I want.

31:52.803 --> 31:54.986
Move out here, and become a painter.

31:55.787 --> 31:58.700
- So what happened?
- I met Mitch ...

31:58.721 --> 32:04.285
and fell into the same doormat
relationship I had with my father.

32:04.340 --> 32:06.635
And you eventually give up painting.

32:07.437 --> 32:12.409
Well, that didn't take much.
I hadn't drawn anything in 4 years.

32:12.501 --> 32:16.050
I don't ... sorry, it's like I have
writer's block or something.

32:16.551 --> 32:22.457
And I'm not very good at confrontation.
At least not until today.

32:22.568 --> 32:25.760
- What happened today?
- I don't know.

32:25.762 --> 32:30.195
I guess I just got tired
of always playing it safe.

32:31.472 --> 32:33.997
Is that what made you
change your mind about posing?

32:37.699 --> 32:39.201
POLICE

32:48.404 --> 32:49.806
CORONER

33:17.315 --> 33:18.615
What happened?

33:18.816 --> 33:21.475
It's Jonas.
He's had an accident.

33:21.485 --> 33:23.281
What?
How?

33:23.282 --> 33:24.582
The boiler.

33:24.883 --> 33:28.245
I begged him to stop drinking...!
I begged him!

33:28.246 --> 33:29.758
He must have been
drunk out of his mind.

33:29.759 --> 33:33.244
She said it looked like he hit the
boiler room door with every tool he had.

33:34.119 --> 33:36.552
Where is Doo?
Where is my dog?

33:36.587 --> 33:38.908
I'm sure he's fine.  He's probably
in the apartment somewhere.

33:39.241 --> 33:42.017
- Don't believe I knew!
- Okay, okay, okay.

36:12.516 --> 36:13.751
Hello?

36:13.752 --> 36:16.450
Paige?  It's Henry.
Are you coming in today?

36:20.257 --> 36:24.960
You know...?  Um...
I'm really not feeling that good, Henry.

36:24.980 --> 36:27.207
I think I'm getting
the flu or something.

36:27.308 --> 36:29.033
Oh well, that explains it then.

36:29.034 --> 36:30.795
I figured it had to be
something pretty serious

36:30.796 --> 36:32.656
in order for you to
miss a day of work.

36:32.757 --> 36:37.090
Oh, yeah!  You know.
I'm sorry I didn't call.

36:37.093 --> 36:38.888
I slept right through my alarm.

36:38.889 --> 36:40.619
No, no, no!
I understand.

36:40.755 --> 36:44.256
- You just get well quick, okay?
- Yeah okay.  Thanks, I will.

37:01.102 --> 37:02.302
Who is it?

37:02.303 --> 37:03.507
Paige, it's me.

37:04.605 --> 37:06.005
What do you want?

37:06.306 --> 37:08.133
Well, I heard about the
accident here yesterday

37:08.134 --> 37:11.388
and I wanted to make
sure that you are alright.

37:16.827 --> 37:18.904
Can I come in, please?

37:32.934 --> 37:35.165
Christ, you look like shit!

37:36.036 --> 37:38.657
You came all the way over
here just to tell me that?

37:38.658 --> 37:39.780
No.

37:39.781 --> 37:41.331
I came over here because
I wanted to make sure

37:41.332 --> 37:43.406
that you are alright.
I was worried.

37:47.719 --> 37:49.068
You did this?

37:50.522 --> 37:51.722
Yeah?  So?

37:52.624 --> 37:55.284
Well, it's .. it's great!

37:59.386 --> 38:00.888
Do you really think so?

38:01.089 --> 38:02.480
Hell, yes I think so!

38:02.485 --> 38:04.441
Paige, when you told
me you wanted to paint

38:04.442 --> 38:07.660
I had absolutely no idea
that you were capable of...

38:13.664 --> 38:16.483
I guess I wasn't
very supportive, was I?

38:20.986 --> 38:22.287
Right...

38:22.688 --> 38:26.000
Well, I should go.
I've got a watch.

38:27.238 --> 38:28.438
Mitch!

38:30.506 --> 38:32.037
Could you do me a favor?

38:32.438 --> 38:33.739
Name it.

38:34.040 --> 38:35.936
A woman named Susan Sidney.

38:36.337 --> 38:38.398
She used to lived here about 2 years ago.

38:39.633 --> 38:41.529
Could you find out how she died?

38:41.931 --> 38:43.432
What for?

38:46.934 --> 38:48.134
Okay.

38:49.236 --> 38:51.067
Might take a couple of days.

38:52.170 --> 38:54.460
Okay.  Thanks.

39:42.484 --> 39:45.277
Ashes to ashes.
Dust to dust.

39:45.787 --> 39:48.074
The Lord giveth and
the Lord taketh away.

39:48.845 --> 39:50.500
Rest in peace, brother Jonas.

39:52.047 --> 39:56.618
In the name of the Father, the
Son, and the Holy Ghost.  Amen.

39:59.220 --> 40:01.710
- Thanks for coming.
- You're welcome.

40:02.812 --> 40:03.948
Thanks for coming.

40:16.855 --> 40:20.949
- You okay?
- Yeah.

40:22.495 --> 40:23.995
I'm glad you came.

40:25.396 --> 40:29.090
- You look great.
- Thanks.

40:30.032 --> 40:34.252
- I didn't see Elaine anywhere.
- She hasn't accepted it yet.

40:34.926 --> 40:38.888
- I suppose it will take time.
- More than you know.

40:39.290 --> 40:42.366
Our parents died in '69,
that's why she's stuck there.

40:43.219 --> 40:44.850
Russel,  I'm sorry.

40:45.951 --> 40:49.400
It was a long time ago.
I was just a kid.

40:50.986 --> 40:54.395
Luckily we inherit a lot of property,
got us through the tough times.

40:55.244 --> 40:58.195
Now if there's anything I
can do, you let me know.

40:58.661 --> 40:59.797
Thanks.

41:01.198 --> 41:02.498
Actually, she's better off without him.

41:02.499 --> 41:04.190
I mean, he was a drunk and a cheat.

41:04.191 --> 41:05.930
- Russel!
- What?

41:06.169 --> 41:08.326
You gonna tell me he
never made a pass at you.

41:12.228 --> 41:13.363
I suppose.

41:13.429 --> 41:14.566
You suppose.

41:15.132 --> 41:17.736
Trust me, he went
after anything in a skirt.

41:18.396 --> 41:19.696
Poor Elaine !

41:20.197 --> 41:21.562
She doesn't know.

41:24.165 --> 41:25.961
How could she not know?

41:26.262 --> 41:28.653
She lives in her own little world.

41:29.255 --> 41:31.521
Reality very rarely intrudes.

41:34.183 --> 41:37.462
Do you think Jonas had an
affair with Susan Sidney?

41:38.064 --> 41:39.365
I know he did.

41:39.566 --> 41:41.332
That's how she paid her rent.

41:43.567 --> 41:45.472
And Elaine never knew?

41:46.235 --> 41:47.712
I made sure she didn't.

41:47.802 --> 41:49.798
And Jonas, he wasn't gonna tell her.

41:52.800 --> 41:54.166
So how did she die?

41:54.767 --> 41:57.498
- Who?
- Susan of course.

41:57.835 --> 42:00.112
Susan's not dead.
She moved.

42:00.369 --> 42:02.200
I made Jonas kick her out.

42:02.902 --> 42:04.202
What?

42:16.308 --> 42:17.708
Okay.

42:18.111 --> 42:19.411
Who are you?

42:20.013 --> 42:21.478
I know you're here.

42:22.380 --> 42:24.010
Answer me, God damn it!

42:27.013 --> 42:29.273
You're not Susan Sidney, are you?

42:30.941 --> 42:31.776
YES.

42:31.777 --> 42:32.878
Okay.

42:32.879 --> 42:33.980
You are Susan...

42:34.981 --> 42:36.281
How did you die?

42:36.882 --> 42:48.582
M-U-R-D-E-R.
Murder?

42:48.789 --> 42:49.982
You were murdered?

42:52.958 --> 42:53.993
No...

42:55.695 --> 42:59.720
I don't believe you.
Russel says Susan's still alive.

43:00.574 --> 43:16.123
R-I-F-L-E   C-A-P-E.

43:17.002 --> 43:18.203
Rifle Cape?

43:18.804 --> 43:20.592
What's that suppose to mean?

43:21.005 --> 43:22.207
Susan...

43:22.208 --> 43:23.432
What does it mean?

43:24.510 --> 43:28.406
Susan, I can't help you unless
you tell me what you want.

43:31.100 --> 43:32.535
BYE.

43:46.044 --> 43:47.739
- Hello?
- Paige.

43:48.342 --> 43:50.267
Hey listen, I got
that info you wanted.

43:50.368 --> 43:53.987
But there is no death certificate
on file for Susan Sidney anywhere.

43:55.328 --> 43:57.093
<i>Are you sure she's dead?</i>

43:58.995 --> 43:59.930
No.

44:00.931 --> 44:04.772
Okay, I've got to run trace and see if
I can find out if she's moved and where.

44:05.075 --> 44:07.894
And I should have the information
for you by tonight, okay?

44:12.931 --> 44:14.832
Hello?
You still there?

44:15.029 --> 44:18.990
Ehhh...  yeah.
I gotta go Mitch.

44:20.233 --> 44:21.433
Okay.

44:21.735 --> 44:22.735
That's it!

44:22.736 --> 44:25.167
I'm through with you,
whoever you are!

44:25.730 --> 44:28.250
This thing is going out
with tonight's garbage!

44:28.316 --> 44:29.352
NO.

45:02.834 --> 45:04.199
Are you sure you're alright?

45:04.701 --> 45:06.251
Maybe we should call a doctor.

45:06.286 --> 45:09.070
No. .. I'm fine.
I just fainted.

45:10.468 --> 45:13.030
You did more than that...

45:13.065 --> 45:18.909
You... You screamed like you
were having a bad acid flashback.

45:19.694 --> 45:23.884
Whats going on, Paige?
When did you paint this?

45:25.829 --> 45:29.162
What do you guys know
about Ouija boards?

45:29.754 --> 45:32.356
Not much.
I mean supposedly

45:32.357 --> 45:35.116
ghosts can spell out messages
with that pointer thing, right?

45:35.642 --> 45:37.443
Do you believe that?

45:37.578 --> 45:38.646
No.

45:39.148 --> 45:42.208
I figure it's probably just
your own subconscious.

45:42.768 --> 45:44.339
How about you?

45:45.606 --> 45:47.458
Last week I would have said no.

45:47.493 --> 45:50.878
It's only a game,
like checkers or chess.

45:52.281 --> 45:53.919
But now I...

45:53.954 --> 45:55.689
I believe it.

45:56.684 --> 45:57.784
You do?

45:58.287 --> 46:01.135
I'm not the only one, Russel...

46:01.270 --> 46:07.000
Lots of people believe in spirits and
that you reach them with the Ouija board.

46:07.016 --> 46:09.691
You can!
I mean I have!

46:11.486 --> 46:15.783
I have been in contact with a
spirit since the day I moved in.

46:17.639 --> 46:19.864
It claims to be Susan Sidney.

46:21.542 --> 46:23.107
But Susan isn't dead.

46:23.109 --> 46:24.840
Well, how do you know that?

46:24.942 --> 46:27.584
I mean... you haven't seen
her in two years, right?

46:28.939 --> 46:31.081
And so I've been painting again.

46:31.637 --> 46:33.039
Susan helped me.

46:34.239 --> 46:37.554
What are you talking about?
Susan was an exotic dancer.

46:39.202 --> 46:43.666
- Susan wasn't an artist?
- A con artist maybe.

46:43.667 --> 46:44.403
Halt...

46:44.404 --> 46:48.190
There is only one way
to find out for sure.

46:49.678 --> 46:50.880
Susan?

46:51.817 --> 46:53.182
If you are Susan...

46:54.283 --> 46:55.284
Are you here?

46:59.788 --> 47:00.888
Susan?

47:00.989 --> 47:04.014
Ladies, this is really weird.

47:04.049 --> 47:06.560
- Hold it, Russel!
- I feel stupid.

47:06.661 --> 47:08.892
Well, so did I at first.

47:16.897 --> 47:18.500
That's Doo.

47:20.199 --> 47:22.378
Susan must be close by.

47:27.199 --> 47:28.970
Susan, is that you?

47:29.632 --> 47:30.768
YES.

47:32.770 --> 47:35.318
And you still claim
to be Susan Sidney?

47:35.353 --> 47:36.528
YES.

47:38.564 --> 47:40.790
Then you know these people with me.

47:41.756 --> 47:42.892
YES.

47:44.195 --> 47:45.330
Good.

47:45.366 --> 47:47.427
They want to ask you some questions.

47:47.992 --> 47:49.127
NO.

47:49.228 --> 47:50.064
No?

47:50.665 --> 47:52.067
Why not?

47:52.669 --> 47:54.664
You are Susan Sidney, right?

47:55.165 --> 48:05.481
U-P-T-O-W-N

48:05.772 --> 48:07.172
Uptown?

48:07.473 --> 48:08.673
Uptown...?

48:08.810 --> 48:10.971
Susan, what's uptown.
You?

48:11.571 --> 48:29.046
2-1-7   P-A-R-K-W-O-O-D

48:29.892 --> 48:34.169
Wow!  217 Parkwood

48:34.909 --> 48:36.410
It's an address.

48:37.311 --> 48:38.512
Susan?

48:39.179 --> 48:40.646
Is that where you murdered?

48:41.247 --> 48:43.586
Come on, guys!
This is not Susan.

48:43.621 --> 48:44.676
YES.

48:47.478 --> 48:49.886
Then, what's your middle name?

48:50.881 --> 48:53.013
When is your birthday?

48:54.514 --> 48:56.743
Where are you from originally?

48:57.716 --> 48:59.172
She's getting agitated...

48:59.173 --> 49:01.014
Why?  Because she can't
answer the lightning round?

49:01.015 --> 49:02.478
Or maybe she's just confused.

49:02.479 --> 49:04.560
Oh, I am sure death
is very disorientating.

49:04.563 --> 49:07.380
Shut up, Russell!
You're upsetting her.

49:07.381 --> 49:09.875
Upsetting who?
This is not Susan.

49:22.982 --> 49:24.782
That's it!

49:25.185 --> 49:28.919
I don't think that's it all.
I'm splitting.

49:40.327 --> 49:42.027
That was incredible!

49:48.497 --> 49:50.971
Maybe you shouldn't
use this thing anymore.

49:58.895 --> 50:03.145
There's a ...
map in the side table.

50:03.803 --> 50:06.362
See if you can find
Parkwood Street.

50:07.289 --> 50:09.229
You sure you want to do this?

50:09.521 --> 50:12.266
Yeah ... I'm sure.

50:26.326 --> 50:28.352
- Hello?
- Paige...

50:28.465 --> 50:32.490
Listen here.  There is absolutely
no paper on this Susan Sidney at all.

50:33.382 --> 50:35.151
Oh so, what does that mean?

50:35.384 --> 50:36.944
Well, it means that when
she moved from there,

50:36.945 --> 50:38.741
she never reestablish her new address,

50:38.748 --> 50:42.627
not with the phone company, the
post office.  None of the utilities.

50:43.003 --> 50:44.833
Oh, that's unusual isn't it?

50:45.299 --> 50:47.850
Well ... not if she moved out of state.

50:47.870 --> 50:49.430
She could have moved
in with somebody here,

50:49.431 --> 50:51.922
who just has all the
utilities in his own name.

50:54.024 --> 50:56.186
Mitch, what's a Rifle Cape?

50:56.986 --> 50:58.287
I have no idea.

50:58.830 --> 51:00.971
It's not part of a gun or something?

51:01.056 --> 51:02.192
No.

51:02.794 --> 51:03.929
Okay.

51:04.065 --> 51:06.392
I can't find Parkwood Street anywhere.

51:06.693 --> 51:07.828
What?

51:17.134 --> 51:21.141
Mitch, do you know where
217 Parkwood Street is?

51:21.880 --> 51:23.346
Never heard of it.

51:23.881 --> 51:26.007
You must have, it's uptown somewhere.

51:26.073 --> 51:27.309
No.

51:27.711 --> 51:30.302
- Not unless...
- Unless what?

51:30.467 --> 51:32.694
Are you sure you're not
talking about Park Woods?

51:32.995 --> 51:34.295
Park Woods?

51:34.296 --> 51:35.956
Right.  The Woods.

51:36.068 --> 51:38.689
Outside the city limits,
near the Interstate...

51:38.724 --> 51:40.421
Yes! Yes!
That must be it!

51:40.522 --> 51:42.188
Thanks, Mitch.
I got to go.

51:46.392 --> 51:47.793
What's up?

51:50.396 --> 51:52.456
Are there any shovels in the basement?

51:52.828 --> 51:54.693
WARNING!
NO TRESPASSING

52:11.722 --> 52:14.568
You know, if I were to
list every stupid stunt

52:14.569 --> 52:17.316
I've ever pulled in my entire life,

52:17.317 --> 52:19.713
this would rate in the top two.

52:19.907 --> 52:22.260
We don't even know
what we're looking for!

52:22.667 --> 52:25.712
I think this is where
Susan was killed and buried.

52:31.200 --> 52:34.018
Oh, man!  I have a
bad feeling about this...

52:43.518 --> 52:44.879
So where do we start?

52:44.986 --> 52:48.682
She said 217 Parkwoods.
That must mean something.

52:48.773 --> 52:51.386
What do you think?  We gonna
find a sign that says 217,

52:51.387 --> 52:52.947
the big "X" that marks the spot?

52:52.982 --> 52:55.052
I don't know, Russell!
It's a mystery!

52:55.154 --> 52:56.585
You don't want to
help me figure it out, fine.

52:56.685 --> 52:59.778
But I've spent all my
entire life playing it safe.

52:59.779 --> 53:03.676
I'm sick of it!
Now I need to do this.

53:04.440 --> 53:07.942
Not just for Susan, but for me.

53:10.343 --> 53:11.809
What was that?

53:16.777 --> 53:18.042
It's footsteps.

53:18.043 --> 53:21.527
- Someone else is here!
- Or something...

53:21.875 --> 53:23.570
We are in the woods, Paige.

53:23.971 --> 53:26.850
It could be a bear... or a cat.

53:28.305 --> 53:30.036
Let's get the hell out of here.

53:47.871 --> 53:49.531
What the hell are you two doing here?

53:50.032 --> 53:53.036
Mitch...
Something's chasing us.

53:53.134 --> 53:54.672
Alright, go to the
car, I'll check it out.

53:54.673 --> 53:57.738
- No, don't go.
- Just do what I'm asking you to, ok?

53:57.779 --> 54:00.404
Come on, Paige, let
him play Dirty Harry.

54:27.735 --> 54:29.202
Who's there?

54:39.337 --> 54:40.867
Here's your bogeyman.

54:44.302 --> 54:47.156
Have you both completely
lost your minds?

54:48.859 --> 54:51.536
Us?   You're the one
who just shot Rocky.

54:51.590 --> 54:54.343
Hey listen, Chuckle Head.
Now is not the time for you

54:54.346 --> 54:57.040
to impress me with your wit.
Do you understand?

54:57.075 --> 54:57.843
Mitch...

54:57.944 --> 54:59.447
No, Paige.
You don't even know this guy.

54:59.448 --> 55:01.478
What are you doing out in the
middle of nowhere with him?

55:01.548 --> 55:04.750
She invited me.  The question is,
what are you doing out here?

55:05.110 --> 55:07.573
I was looking for Paige.
I was worried about her.

55:07.732 --> 55:09.889
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

55:10.034 --> 55:12.389
I wonder if wasn't you
chasing us back there.

55:12.855 --> 55:13.955
What ?

55:14.357 --> 55:17.200
Maybe you trying to scare...
Get her to move back in.

55:17.319 --> 55:19.280
Your charm sure isn't gonna do it.

55:21.482 --> 55:22.876
Stop it!
Both of you.

55:22.877 --> 55:25.205
- You're very brave with that gun.
- Then you want me to get rid of it?

55:25.208 --> 55:29.117
- Yeah!  Give it to me!
- Shut up!  Just shut the fuck up!

55:31.569 --> 55:33.299
Come on.
I'm taking you home.

55:36.771 --> 55:40.028
Are you asking me or telling me?

55:42.827 --> 55:48.372
I'm asking you.
Please...

55:58.296 --> 56:00.228
I'll call you tomorrow, okay?

56:25.430 --> 56:27.227
What's happening to you, Paige?

56:28.530 --> 56:30.094
What do you mean?

56:31.396 --> 56:33.256
Now look at the way you're dressed...

56:36.493 --> 56:39.464
- What about it?
- Baby, that's not you.

56:41.093 --> 56:44.476
Same as the first time I've
ever heard you swear, ever.

56:44.819 --> 56:47.481
Since when did you notice
anything I said ...?

56:48.082 --> 56:50.900
Or wanted, or cared about?

56:51.202 --> 56:52.768
I noticed...

56:53.968 --> 56:55.693
I'm not an idiot, Paige.

56:56.435 --> 56:58.164
I knew you were unhappy, I just ...

56:59.707 --> 57:01.394
I don't know, I was
afraid to mention it to you

57:01.395 --> 57:03.445
because I thought you would leave.

57:04.498 --> 57:06.028
But I left you anyway.

57:06.930 --> 57:09.304
Well, I didn't say it was a good plan.

57:13.391 --> 57:15.587
It really hurt me when you left.

57:16.386 --> 57:18.278
And you know how I get when I'm hurt.

57:18.279 --> 57:21.003
I'm angry and nasty...

57:22.238 --> 57:24.663
It doesn't mean that
I don't care about you.

57:25.164 --> 57:26.566
I know.

57:27.066 --> 57:28.887
I want you to move back in.

57:31.997 --> 57:35.109
- I can't.
- Why not?

57:36.300 --> 57:40.096
This Russell character, I
suppose he's the sensitive type.

57:40.097 --> 57:45.731
- Knows exactly what you need?
- I don't even know exactly what I need.

59:15.017 --> 59:18.386
PANPIPES
MAGICKAL MARKETPLACE

59:19.513 --> 59:21.855
I know what you're thinking.

59:22.239 --> 59:24.595
You've never seen
a Jewish occultist before.

59:25.031 --> 59:27.374
Not to worry, I'm not orthodox.

59:27.629 --> 59:30.351
First thing you gotta understand,

59:30.528 --> 59:35.762
is that spirits are all
around us all... the time.

59:36.650 --> 59:39.438
But they can't reach us
without some kind of help.

59:39.473 --> 59:40.864
Like the Ouija board!

59:40.898 --> 59:42.265
Correct!

59:42.664 --> 59:44.459
When you use the Ouija...

59:44.660 --> 59:46.089
you open the door...

59:46.289 --> 59:47.657
and the spirits...

59:48.657 --> 59:50.120
can step through.

59:50.122 --> 59:52.742
So that's how she was
able to break my mirror?

59:52.743 --> 59:54.503
Because we were using the Ouija.

59:54.604 --> 59:55.803
Right!

59:56.004 --> 59:58.093
No Ouija, no broken glass.

59:58.264 --> 59:59.859
Couldn't that be dangerous?

59:59.960 --> 01:00:01.162
Sure.

01:00:01.863 --> 01:00:03.922
You get an evil spirit...

01:00:06.559 --> 01:00:11.581
You could have furniture and
silverware flying all over the place.

01:00:11.976 --> 01:00:14.037
This spirit of yours,
she was murdered.

01:00:14.538 --> 01:00:16.518
Yes... How...?
How did you know that?

01:00:17.998 --> 01:00:19.627
They all say that.

01:00:19.828 --> 01:00:22.286
Being dead must be really dull.

01:00:22.486 --> 01:00:25.314
Because they love to "talk" to us.

01:00:25.342 --> 01:00:27.101
But they know we won't talk to them

01:00:27.102 --> 01:00:30.204
if they're some boring
schmuck who died of old age.

01:00:30.553 --> 01:00:33.100
So they say they were murdered.

01:00:33.418 --> 01:00:37.149
I guess even in the spirit world,
sex and violence sells.

01:00:37.508 --> 01:00:40.776
So what are you saying?
All spirits are liars.

01:00:41.072 --> 01:00:43.611
To a degree, yeah.

01:00:43.646 --> 01:00:47.411
- What's a a rifle cape?
- You got me.

01:00:48.030 --> 01:00:50.831
It isn't some spiritual
term of some kind?

01:00:51.350 --> 01:00:52.792
Not that I know of.

01:00:53.317 --> 01:00:55.437
Are you sure she didn't misspell it?

01:00:56.478 --> 01:00:59.189
- Is that possible?
- Are you kidding?

01:00:59.310 --> 01:01:01.104
Spirits are terrible spellers.

01:01:01.305 --> 01:01:04.781
Their communication skills in
general leave a lot to be desired.

01:01:05.568 --> 01:01:06.696
Look...

01:01:07.104 --> 01:01:09.887
assuming that all this stuff

01:01:09.971 --> 01:01:14.113
isn't just a bunch of "mumbo jumbo".

01:01:14.469 --> 01:01:18.872
How can we be sure this
spirit really is who it says it is?

01:01:19.322 --> 01:01:20.672
You're not sure?

01:01:21.887 --> 01:01:25.666
- Did you know her when she was alive?
- I did.

01:01:25.750 --> 01:01:30.899
I got just the thing ... for you.

01:01:31.075 --> 01:01:36.621
- What is it?
- An automatic writer.

01:01:37.226 --> 01:01:40.657
You use it just like
a regular planchet.

01:01:41.023 --> 01:01:45.117
You put it on a sketch pad
instead of a Ouija board.

01:01:45.511 --> 01:01:50.380
And ... you stick
a pen ... in this hole.

01:01:50.631 --> 01:01:56.673
Then this, Susan of yours will actually
have to write out her messages.

01:01:56.851 --> 01:01:58.724
Well, what good is that?

01:01:58.811 --> 01:02:01.794
If it's really her, it will be
her handwriting, not yours.

01:02:02.723 --> 01:02:04.476
That's incredible!

01:02:05.487 --> 01:02:07.465
When did they come up with this?

01:02:07.466 --> 01:02:11.000
What's today?  The fifth.
About two thousand years ago.

01:02:11.790 --> 01:02:17.168
They actually predate Ouija boards
been around since at least 540 BC.

01:02:17.468 --> 01:02:20.572
Which makes them only slightly
older than my mother-in-law.

01:02:21.297 --> 01:02:26.342
You got any other questions ...
Read this.

01:02:28.322 --> 01:02:30.864
The Complete History Of
OUIJA

01:02:32.322 --> 01:02:36.253
So, as soon as we get back, see if
find a sample of Susan's handwriting.

01:02:37.177 --> 01:02:38.738
Can't wait to use this.

01:02:38.897 --> 01:02:42.146
Maybe you should read the book first.
Find out what you're doing.

01:02:43.301 --> 01:02:45.835
You read the book.
I know what I'm doing.

01:02:46.193 --> 01:02:47.755
What's the big hurry?

01:02:47.973 --> 01:02:50.130
Why can't you wait one lousy day?

01:02:50.131 --> 01:02:52.700
- What for?
- What for?

01:02:53.035 --> 01:02:55.757
Paige, look at yourself.
You're obsessed with that Ouija board.

01:02:56.138 --> 01:02:59.250
Russell, why do you even care?
You don't even believe in it.

01:02:59.274 --> 01:03:00.416
No, I don't.

01:03:01.218 --> 01:03:03.023
You were there, Russell.

01:03:03.058 --> 01:03:06.029
You saw the pointer move
with your own eyes.

01:03:06.704 --> 01:03:12.158
It was your subconscious,
or Elaine's or maybe even mine.

01:03:12.293 --> 01:03:15.151
So who's subconscious
shattered the mirror?

01:03:15.427 --> 01:03:16.720
I don't know.

01:03:16.724 --> 01:03:19.436
But there's a logical
explanation somewhere.

01:03:19.536 --> 01:03:20.779
Yes!

01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:24.936
Susan Sidney is dead and
she wants me to find her body.

01:03:35.985 --> 01:03:42.500
Promise me, you won't use the Ouija or
the writer till I read this book, okay?

01:03:42.712 --> 01:03:45.564
Okay, Mom, I promise.

01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:10.001
CAR  FILE

01:05:23.693 --> 01:05:25.364
FIRE  PLACE

01:06:35.668 --> 01:06:36.811
Hello?

01:06:37.070 --> 01:06:38.783
Paige, it's Mitch.

01:06:39.114 --> 01:06:41.653
Listen, I think I found
your friend Susan Sidney.

01:06:41.914 --> 01:06:43.478
You're kidding?
Where?

01:06:43.568 --> 01:06:45.671
Well, it seems a couple
of years ago, Parks Woods

01:06:45.672 --> 01:06:48.594
was going to be
developed into tract homes.

01:06:48.685 --> 01:06:52.137
The plans fell through but not before
they subdivided the land into lots.

01:06:52.138 --> 01:06:54.841
And one of the lots is number 217.

01:06:55.298 --> 01:06:57.060
Mitch, that's great!

01:06:57.363 --> 01:06:59.160
Yeah... Well, I'm going to
head up to it right now.

01:06:59.161 --> 01:07:01.452
- Okay yeah.  I'll meet you there.
- No!

01:07:01.491 --> 01:07:04.001
Listen.  It's police business.
If there is a body out there

01:07:04.002 --> 01:07:06.425
you're out of it, as of now.
You got it?

01:07:07.796 --> 01:07:09.920
- Wait, I was the one who...
- No!

01:07:09.921 --> 01:07:12.805
No "buts", Paige.
And I mean it, okay?

01:07:14.205 --> 01:07:17.401
Okay, but you call me as
soon as you find something.

01:07:17.436 --> 01:07:19.380
I will.
Goodbye.

01:07:34.381 --> 01:07:35.681
Susan?

01:07:36.483 --> 01:07:37.982
Susan are you here?

01:07:40.984 --> 01:07:42.184
Susan...?

01:07:49.887 --> 01:07:51.415
Susan, I have good news.

01:07:51.850 --> 01:07:54.833
Mitch found your body.
He's driving out there right now.

01:08:02.170 --> 01:08:04.470
Stop.

01:08:04.974 --> 01:08:06.238
Stop?

01:08:06.772 --> 01:08:08.736
Isn't that what you want?

01:08:09.669 --> 01:08:10.869
Susan!

01:08:11.870 --> 01:08:13.673
Susan!
What do you want?

01:12:08.674 --> 01:12:10.665
Paige...
Paige!

01:12:10.866 --> 01:12:12.431
Snap out of it!

01:12:17.932 --> 01:12:19.497
What happened?

01:12:21.698 --> 01:12:25.222
You had to use it, didn't you!
You just couldn't wait.

01:12:26.689 --> 01:12:28.880
Please, no lectures.

01:12:29.315 --> 01:12:32.578
- Still feeling a little faint?
- It's nothing.

01:12:32.911 --> 01:12:35.037
No, it's not.

01:12:35.272 --> 01:12:38.788
I've been reading this book on Ouija's
and it scared the hell out of me.

01:12:39.296 --> 01:12:41.190
Do you know what
they used to be called?

01:12:41.659 --> 01:12:42.924
Before this century...?

01:12:43.025 --> 01:12:44.289
"Witch boards".

01:12:44.590 --> 01:12:45.650
Yeah.

01:12:45.659 --> 01:12:47.782
Witches used them to contact demons.

01:12:48.584 --> 01:12:50.181
Remember when I said
you were obsessed.

01:12:50.551 --> 01:12:51.916
Well, I was right.

01:12:52.017 --> 01:12:55.000
According to this book,
when you use the Ouija alone

01:12:55.012 --> 01:12:58.915
like you've been doing, you're very
susceptible to the spirit you contact.

01:12:59.733 --> 01:13:02.154
At first they'll be
helpful and friendly

01:13:02.155 --> 01:13:05.138
so it can get you to use
the board over and over.

01:13:06.609 --> 01:13:10.082
And each time you do, he gets
stronger and you get weaker.

01:13:10.368 --> 01:13:13.050
Soon you're so weak, you have to
use it whether you want to or not.

01:13:13.231 --> 01:13:15.850
What are you telling me?
I'm a Ouija junkie?

01:13:15.851 --> 01:13:17.381
It's no joke, Paige!

01:13:17.449 --> 01:13:20.397
It's called "progressive
entrapment" and it gets worse.

01:13:20.599 --> 01:13:23.055
After you're addicted,
the spirit changes.

01:13:23.355 --> 01:13:25.872
He starts to threaten
and terrorize you

01:13:26.441 --> 01:13:29.554
breaking down your
resistance like brainwashing.

01:13:29.868 --> 01:13:32.490
So eventually it can possess you.

01:13:32.791 --> 01:13:35.219
Why would Susan want to possess me?

01:13:35.254 --> 01:13:36.445
It's not Susan!

01:13:36.545 --> 01:13:37.847
Yes, it is!

01:13:39.047 --> 01:13:40.147
Look...

01:13:40.914 --> 01:13:43.351
She lost this when she was killed.

01:13:43.742 --> 01:13:45.760
This could be anybody's.

01:13:45.795 --> 01:13:47.067
It's Susan's!

01:13:47.669 --> 01:13:48.934
Oh, yeah?

01:13:49.035 --> 01:13:50.899
Here, take a look at this.

01:13:51.267 --> 01:13:52.532
What is it?

01:13:52.701 --> 01:13:54.230
Susan's lease agreement.

01:13:54.332 --> 01:13:57.115
Compare the "S"s in her
signature to the "S" in STOP.

01:14:03.851 --> 01:14:05.015
It doesn't match!

01:14:05.615 --> 01:14:07.110
No!  It doesn't!

01:14:07.713 --> 01:14:09.307
Well, then who the fuck is it?

01:14:09.408 --> 01:14:11.014
It doesn't matter who it is!

01:14:11.049 --> 01:14:13.109
Well, what it is, you have
to stop using the Ouija

01:14:13.110 --> 01:14:15.281
and the automatic writer right now!

01:14:15.587 --> 01:14:19.601
Russel, I'm not falling
into progressive entrapment.

01:14:19.844 --> 01:14:21.573
Oh, no?  Here...

01:14:21.774 --> 01:14:23.930
Let me read you some of the symptoms.

01:14:24.365 --> 01:14:27.554
Fainting spells, aggression,

01:14:27.933 --> 01:14:30.156
excessive use of profanity,

01:14:30.692 --> 01:14:34.171
overtly sexual,
provocative behaviour.

01:14:36.645 --> 01:14:38.505
Sound like anyone you know?

01:14:38.906 --> 01:14:40.700
Russell, what am I going to do?

01:14:42.803 --> 01:14:44.413
I'm glad you asked.

01:14:47.933 --> 01:14:51.381
Here, take these and toss
them into the dumpster.

01:14:51.382 --> 01:14:54.604
- Should I take the earring too?
- No!  All on to it.

01:14:55.476 --> 01:14:57.996
Good night, Paige.
I'll call you tomorrow.

01:16:34.900 --> 01:16:35.899
Hello?

01:16:35.900 --> 01:16:39.674
<i>Hi Paige?  I'm Officer Rogers.
I hope you remember me...</i>

01:16:39.768 --> 01:16:41.594
I remember you.
Mitch's friend, right?

01:16:41.595 --> 01:16:43.453
<i>Right.
Mitch has been in an accident.</i>

01:16:43.454 --> 01:16:44.455
What?

01:16:44.657 --> 01:16:45.657
Where?

01:16:45.658 --> 01:16:46.987
<i>Ah, in the County Hospital.</i>

01:16:47.287 --> 01:16:49.250
Yeah... yeah...
Thanks.  Okay.

01:18:03.153 --> 01:18:06.470
- Russel?
- Elaine!

01:18:07.188 --> 01:18:10.820
- Something wrong?
- You tell me.

01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:12.486
What do you mean?

01:18:12.688 --> 01:18:16.140
You forged that lease
agreement you showed to Paige.

01:18:16.878 --> 01:18:18.543
What are you talking about?

01:18:20.045 --> 01:18:22.080
I found the real one.

01:18:22.876 --> 01:18:24.077
Look.

01:18:24.378 --> 01:18:26.502
The "S"s all match perfectly.

01:18:28.303 --> 01:18:31.123
It really is Susan's spirit, isn't it?

01:18:31.424 --> 01:18:32.792
I think so.

01:18:33.924 --> 01:18:36.238
And I think she
caused Jonas's accident.

01:18:41.381 --> 01:18:43.944
Elaine!
Wait!

01:19:07.785 --> 01:19:09.213
All right you bitch!

01:19:09.548 --> 01:19:11.378
I know you're not Susan.

01:19:11.715 --> 01:19:13.941
So what the hell do you want from me?

01:19:15.276 --> 01:19:16.904
I know you're here!

01:19:20.106 --> 01:19:21.835
What do you want from me?

01:19:24.437 --> 01:19:26.332
Answer me, God damn it!

01:19:27.534 --> 01:19:29.099
What do you want?

01:20:03.499 --> 01:20:05.756
Russel, I don't want
to talk about it ...

01:20:05.757 --> 01:20:08.245
Just leave me alone!
Go home!

01:21:27.655 --> 01:21:29.056
Come on!

01:21:34.356 --> 01:21:36.540
Official Mitchell!
What are you doing out of bed?

01:21:36.575 --> 01:21:37.748
Going checking out.

01:21:37.749 --> 01:21:40.239
But Dr. Gillano hasn't released you.

01:23:16.944 --> 01:23:18.109
Russel?

01:23:31.710 --> 01:23:32.875
Russel!

01:23:37.178 --> 01:23:38.343
Russel...?

01:23:41.978 --> 01:23:43.143
Paige!

01:24:00.445 --> 01:24:01.544
Listen.

01:24:01.845 --> 01:24:03.770
We need to go back Park Woods.

01:24:03.906 --> 01:24:07.004
I know where Susan is buried
and I know how she died.

01:24:07.864 --> 01:24:09.258
The only thing I don't know

01:24:09.259 --> 01:24:10.948
is why she said the
woods were uptown

01:24:10.949 --> 01:24:12.982
when they were actually
up by the interstate.

01:24:13.346 --> 01:24:16.203
I thought you were going
to stop using the Ouija.

01:24:16.305 --> 01:24:17.835
I don't think I can.

01:24:18.336 --> 01:24:21.470
You were right.  I've fallen
into progressive entrapment.

01:24:21.864 --> 01:24:24.617
God damn it!
Why don't you just leave it alone!

01:24:27.054 --> 01:24:29.993
Russel.
What's the matter with you?

01:24:30.110 --> 01:24:31.821
Why are you so angry?

01:24:45.371 --> 01:24:46.739
Oh my God!

01:24:50.906 --> 01:24:53.132
She wasn't saying "uptown".

01:24:54.832 --> 01:24:57.194
She misspelt Upton.

01:25:01.793 --> 01:25:04.941
You said you inherited property.

01:25:05.774 --> 01:25:07.239
Park Woods?

01:25:09.442 --> 01:25:11.205
You murdered Susan!

01:25:15.905 --> 01:25:17.005
Paige!

01:25:17.006 --> 01:25:18.208
Stay away from me!

01:25:18.210 --> 01:25:19.730
Let me explain...

01:25:25.474 --> 01:25:26.675
Paige...

01:25:27.275 --> 01:25:29.896
Open the door, and let me
tell you what happened!

01:25:33.577 --> 01:25:34.841
Susan!

01:25:35.775 --> 01:25:37.636
Susan, I need your help!

01:25:37.738 --> 01:25:40.293
No!
Don't use the Ouija!

01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:48.725
Paige!

01:25:54.996 --> 01:25:56.690
Susan, please!

01:26:02.159 --> 01:26:03.524
Hold it!

01:26:04.825 --> 01:26:06.124
I got you!

01:26:08.461 --> 01:26:09.826
Scumbag...

01:26:15.627 --> 01:26:17.057
Drop the pick axe.

01:26:22.259 --> 01:26:23.458
We have to stop her.

01:26:23.894 --> 01:26:26.004
Like you stop Susan Sidney?

01:26:26.888 --> 01:26:29.610
I didn't kill Susan!
Elaine did!

01:26:29.619 --> 01:26:31.780
She must have found out
about her affair with Jonas.

01:26:32.283 --> 01:26:33.647
Yeah, right.

01:26:35.882 --> 01:26:38.337
You just helped her hide
the body, didn't you?

01:26:38.538 --> 01:26:39.968
No!  That was Jonas!

01:26:40.304 --> 01:26:44.775
I didn't know anything about it!
I really thought Susan moved.

01:26:45.392 --> 01:26:46.864
I'm sure you did.

01:26:46.964 --> 01:26:51.651
Paige!  Come on out here, babe.
Everything's under control!

01:26:53.084 --> 01:26:54.516
Listen to me...

01:26:54.817 --> 01:26:58.453
Susan came back for revenge...
To kill Jonas and Elaine.

01:26:58.506 --> 01:27:00.431
But now I think she wants more.

01:27:00.531 --> 01:27:01.890
She wants her life back!

01:27:01.891 --> 01:27:04.484
And she's going to possess
Paige unless we stop her.

01:27:04.750 --> 01:27:06.922
What ...?
Possess Paige?

01:27:07.177 --> 01:27:09.336
What the hell are you
talking about, man?

01:27:12.039 --> 01:27:13.338
Paige!

01:27:40.673 --> 01:27:42.140
Who the hell are you?

01:28:08.441 --> 01:28:09.742
Official Mitchell...

01:28:10.443 --> 01:28:12.731
So nice of you to drop by.

01:29:07.135 --> 01:29:08.896
What's with the gun, Russel?

01:29:09.898 --> 01:29:11.826
Aren't you happy to see me.

01:29:16.027 --> 01:29:17.759
You can't kill me...

01:29:20.359 --> 01:29:22.089
I'm already dead.

01:29:37.525 --> 01:29:38.988
Look, Russell...

01:29:40.659 --> 01:29:42.289
I have nothing against you.

01:29:43.390 --> 01:29:46.093
After all, Elaine was
the one who killed me.

01:29:46.484 --> 01:29:49.207
Just let me walk out of here...
and we'll call it even.

01:29:50.206 --> 01:29:52.843
I can't.
I can't do that.

01:29:53.275 --> 01:29:54.904
You don't have a choice.

01:29:54.906 --> 01:29:57.366
You shoot me, you shoot Paige.

01:29:59.100 --> 01:30:01.011
And it would be a
shame to put a hole

01:30:01.012 --> 01:30:03.625
in such a nice body
when I just got it.

01:30:05.946 --> 01:30:07.971
It is a nice body, isn't it?

01:30:09.513 --> 01:30:12.258
Not as nice as mine,
but then I was a dancer.

01:30:12.441 --> 01:30:16.071
You were a bitch!
And you still are.

01:30:16.274 --> 01:30:20.214
But you wanted me
anyways, didn't you?

01:30:20.868 --> 01:30:22.838
And you wanted Paige...

01:30:24.164 --> 01:30:25.858
Put the gun down, Russell!

01:30:26.761 --> 01:30:29.654
And you can have us
both at the same time.

01:30:33.382 --> 01:30:34.722
Come on, Russell!

01:30:35.120 --> 01:30:38.434
It's not everyday you get
a chance to fuck a ghost.

01:30:38.669 --> 01:30:40.960
Stay back!
I mean it...

01:31:25.662 --> 01:31:30.273
Let her go ... Susan!
She's innocent...

01:31:33.882 --> 01:31:39.359
Nobody's innocent!
And I want my life back!

01:32:07.996 --> 01:32:09.262
Paige!

01:32:37.598 --> 01:32:39.395
Evening, officer Mitchell...

01:32:40.994 --> 01:32:42.104
Where is she?

01:32:42.295 --> 01:32:44.156
You tell me where
she is, where's Paige.

01:32:44.658 --> 01:32:46.633
Tell me where she is,
you little bitch!

01:32:48.018 --> 01:32:49.647
Where is she?

01:32:51.349 --> 01:32:53.144
Right here, officer Mitchell...

01:32:54.045 --> 01:32:55.246
Mitch...

01:32:55.546 --> 01:32:57.012
Help me, please!

01:32:59.012 --> 01:33:00.212
Paige...?

01:33:17.714 --> 01:33:19.739
Seven years bad luck!

01:33:28.541 --> 01:33:29.740
Please!

01:33:31.073 --> 01:33:32.406
Whoever you are...

01:33:34.907 --> 01:33:36.473
Let Paige go...

01:33:37.875 --> 01:33:40.000
Actually, I'm doing her a favor...

01:33:41.236 --> 01:33:43.261
She was always afraid of life.

01:33:45.096 --> 01:33:47.981
Now she doesn't have
to be afraid anymore.

01:33:51.681 --> 01:33:53.111
Paige!
Don't!

01:33:54.679 --> 01:33:56.144
You can fight her!

01:33:56.446 --> 01:33:58.142
I know you can stop her!

01:33:58.376 --> 01:33:59.841
I know you can!...

01:34:00.744 --> 01:34:03.041
You fight her, Paige!
You fight her!

01:34:03.410 --> 01:34:05.536
That's it!
Fight her!

01:35:03.138 --> 01:35:05.494
Don't tell me you're having
second thoughts about moving.

01:35:06.095 --> 01:35:07.295
No.

01:35:08.194 --> 01:35:12.195
Now that found Susan's body has
finally been found and laid to rest...

01:35:12.224 --> 01:35:14.183
I'm ready to move on with my life.

01:35:14.484 --> 01:35:16.775
And I'm definitely going to
go to art school this time ...

01:35:16.776 --> 01:35:18.405
and nothing is going to stop me.

01:35:18.840 --> 01:35:21.095
So, can I call you
once you're settled in?

01:35:21.795 --> 01:35:24.077
I'll be insulted if you didn't.

01:35:24.699 --> 01:35:27.217
You should know by now,
I'm not so easy to get rid off.

01:35:28.319 --> 01:35:30.643
Who says I want to get rid of you?

01:35:42.146 --> 01:35:44.504
Chuck, you and Linda
finally have that baby, huh?

01:35:44.539 --> 01:35:46.846
Yeah.
A boy.  Named him Brandon.

01:35:46.899 --> 01:35:48.598
Yeah alright Chip.

01:35:51.301 --> 01:35:53.900
- Hey!  Look at this!
- What?

01:35:54.132 --> 01:35:55.960
Well, it looks like one of those...

01:35:55.963 --> 01:35:58.189
You know, the pointer
things, to a Ouija board.

01:35:58.892 --> 01:36:00.616
Oh man, those things
give me the creeps.

01:36:00.852 --> 01:36:02.713
Look, this one's got a pen in it.

01:36:02.750 --> 01:36:04.423
Huh, you can actually write with it.

01:36:04.847 --> 01:36:06.276
Mike, come on!
Put it back!

01:36:06.277 --> 01:36:07.426
We got to go.

01:36:07.929 --> 01:36:09.955
You don't think these
things really work, do you?

01:36:16.057 --> 01:36:18.388
YES.
