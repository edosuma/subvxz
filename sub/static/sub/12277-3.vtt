00:01.126 --> 00:02.115
CARTER:
Previously on Eureka...

00:03.170 --> 00:06.662
I'm locked out of the system,
the ship is about to launch
and I can't stop it!

00:09.593 --> 00:10.503
Where'd they go?

00:10.677 --> 00:12.213
BEVERLY: The greatest
scientists of our time

00:12.387 --> 00:14.594
are wired into
an artificial world
that we control.

00:15.140 --> 00:17.426
ALLISON: | see a lot of things
have changed since I left.

00:18.101 --> 00:18.931
What the hell?

00:19.102 --> 00:20.137
Zane, can you hear me?

00:20.312 --> 00:21.301
DEKKER: We're losing him.

00:22.314 --> 00:23.429
But we understand our orders.

00:23.982 --> 00:25.438
Should any of
the Astraeus crew

00:25.609 --> 00:27.065
threaten to
expose the construct,

00:27.236 --> 00:28.351
they will be retired.

00:28.529 --> 00:31.145
We could all be inside
some totally advanced
computer construct

00:31.323 --> 00:33.109
that just looks and feels
like the real world.

00:33.283 --> 00:35.274
And we wouldn't
even know it.

00:35.702 --> 00:37.283
I'm really sorry
you said that.

00:37.454 --> 00:39.695
You're killing her.
She's dangerous.
You know it.

00:40.290 --> 00:41.450
(INCESSANT BEEPING)

00:43.544 --> 00:44.829
CARTER: Want to know
how they knew we were coming?

00:45.003 --> 00:47.870
Because I told her.

00:57.182 --> 00:59.389
Widen the search protocols
and shift to level seven.

00:59.560 --> 01:00.549
Yes, sir.

01:00.811 --> 01:01.971
Jack,lhave
nothing so far...

01:02.145 --> 01:03.681
Yeah, I've just been
looking through the, uh,

01:03.855 --> 01:05.516
pre-launch
footage again,

01:05.983 --> 01:09.475
and could Senator Wen
have a device that
affected the launch?

01:12.614 --> 01:14.991
If there was
a Trojan horse virus

01:15.158 --> 01:16.944
buried in the launch code,

01:17.119 --> 01:18.950
maybe she triggered it,

01:19.830 --> 01:22.913
but they're written
so they disappear
after they do theirjob.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.745
There'd be no evidence.

01:26.587 --> 01:27.702
Hmm.

01:31.008 --> 01:34.421
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
come on, you,
you saw her face, right?

01:34.595 --> 01:37.052
When that ship disappeared,
she looked relieved, she...

01:37.222 --> 01:39.804
Jack, look...

01:41.935 --> 01:44.176
I'm not doubting
your instincts,

01:44.354 --> 01:45.810
all I'm saying is
you can't accuse

01:45.981 --> 01:48.097
a United States senator
without proof.

01:48.275 --> 01:51.233
She will bury you
and that helps no one,

01:51.403 --> 01:53.644
so we have
to tread lightly.

01:53.822 --> 01:55.813
Oh, Senator Wen.

01:56.658 --> 01:58.239
So good to see you.

01:58.410 --> 02:00.492
Sheriff Carter.
Dr. Deacon.

02:00.662 --> 02:01.617
How are you
both holding up?

02:02.164 --> 02:04.906
Oh, we were just
discussing the next
phase of the search.

02:05.292 --> 02:08.159
Right. Well, I've gone
through all the reports

02:08.337 --> 02:10.749
and it's become clear
that this was an
elaborate tech theft.

02:11.256 --> 02:15.124
The experts tell me
that an organization
as sophisticated as this,

02:15.302 --> 02:17.918
odds are,
they won't be leaving
any witnesses behind...

02:18.096 --> 02:20.428
And no offense
to your experts,

02:20.599 --> 02:22.339
but we're just gonna
keep on looking.

02:24.686 --> 02:27.393
Of course.
We all will.

02:28.857 --> 02:30.313
Stay strong.

02:36.198 --> 02:39.190
So Senator Wen insists
it was a tech theft?
Yeah.

02:39.368 --> 02:40.733
But you don't
believe her?
No.

02:40.911 --> 02:42.447
Because you think that
the crew was kidnapped?
Yeah.

02:42.621 --> 02:44.737
Okay, but wouldn't we
have received some
kind of ransom demand?

02:44.915 --> 02:47.702
Not if the kidnappers
didn't want us to know
that the crew was taken.

02:47.876 --> 02:48.911
Okay, so they
hijacked the launch

02:49.086 --> 02:50.826
to take the crew,
not the ship.

02:51.004 --> 02:51.868
Exactly.

02:52.047 --> 02:54.208
Okay, but this would
take months to plan...
Yeah.

02:54.383 --> 02:56.465
And Senator Wen couldn't
do this on her own.

02:56.635 --> 02:58.216
No, I mean...

02:58.762 --> 03:01.845
Yeah, I guess the question
is who would she... Okay.

03:02.015 --> 03:03.391
Henry said,
for this to be possible,

03:03.558 --> 03:06.300
a virus would have
to have been planted.

03:06.478 --> 03:08.764
We had one
security breach
in the last year.

03:08.939 --> 03:10.554
Beverly Barlowe.
Right.

03:12.818 --> 03:14.809
She could have accessed
the computer when she
brain-jacked Allison.

03:14.986 --> 03:16.442
And, and, it was
during that time

03:16.613 --> 03:17.819
that she was named
interim head of
Global Dynamics by...

03:17.989 --> 03:22.358
Senator Wen. They've...
They've been working
together this entire time.

03:22.536 --> 03:24.447
Maybe. Yeah. I mean,
we were so focused
on what was taken,

03:24.621 --> 03:26.122
we didn't think that
something could have
beenleﬁ.

03:26.289 --> 03:29.577
A virus to
take over the launch.
Right.

03:29.751 --> 03:30.831
Beverly's the
key to this thing.

03:31.002 --> 03:32.913
We find her,
we find the crew.

03:33.630 --> 03:35.086
She's been on every
"Most Wanted" list

03:35.257 --> 03:37.293
since the OD. break-in
and we have no leads.

03:37.467 --> 03:40.800
It's like
she's a ghost.

03:45.100 --> 03:48.137
You two look like
you could use
a little help.

04:02.743 --> 04:03.903
I came to you.

04:06.621 --> 04:07.827
Oh, let me think... Yes.

04:07.998 --> 04:11.240
Now, again.
Where is the crew?

04:11.793 --> 04:13.658
That's a complicated
question, Sheriff.

04:14.129 --> 04:15.790
I know an easy way
to make her answer.

04:15.964 --> 04:17.500
Their minds are in
a total immersion...

04:17.674 --> 04:19.539
simulated reality program.

04:19.718 --> 04:21.879
They think they're in Eureka
four years in the future.

04:23.013 --> 04:26.005
They're connected
to a photonic plasma
computer mainframe,

04:26.183 --> 04:28.845
housed in a mobile
neural networking lab.

04:29.352 --> 04:30.307
But I don't know
where it is.

04:30.479 --> 04:31.514
Oh, here's a thought,

04:31.688 --> 04:33.929
why don't you
call your buddies
and find out?

04:34.608 --> 04:36.394
I had a falling out with
one of my associates.

04:37.861 --> 04:39.977
Would that be
a Senator Wen?

04:40.822 --> 04:43.985
You always were good
at yourjob, Sheriff, yes.

04:44.159 --> 04:45.319
She's out of control.

04:45.494 --> 04:47.701
So your boss fired you and
now you're here for payback?

04:47.871 --> 04:48.860
She's not my boss.

04:49.039 --> 04:50.245
She deviated
from the plan

04:50.415 --> 04:52.406
and now the entire
crew's in jeopardy.

04:52.584 --> 04:55.246
To be clear, I never
intended to hurt anyone,

04:55.420 --> 04:57.706
I just wanted
to borrow their
intellect for a while.

04:57.881 --> 04:59.837
Oh, that's good of you.
You're a real humanitarian.

05:00.008 --> 05:00.838
I think so.

05:01.009 --> 05:03.375
Rather than building
better weapons for the
Department of Defense...

05:03.553 --> 05:05.885
This is crazy.
I say we hand her
over to the Feds.

05:06.056 --> 05:08.422
You make that call,
Wen finds out I'm here.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.932
She finds out I'm here,
she pulls the plug
on the operation,

05:11.102 --> 05:14.310
and her version
of pulling the plug
leaves no witnesses.

05:22.113 --> 05:23.239
All right.

05:24.783 --> 05:26.114
Why are you here?

05:26.284 --> 05:29.321
The program is glitching
and the crew is
questioning their reality.

05:29.496 --> 05:30.360
It's only a matter of time

05:30.539 --> 05:31.494
before they
discover the truth.

05:31.665 --> 05:32.620
Seems like a good thing.

05:32.791 --> 05:34.372
It's a death sentence.

05:34.543 --> 05:35.407
One of the crew members

05:35.585 --> 05:37.496
already learned that
the hard way.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.081
Who?

05:39.256 --> 05:40.871
Dr. Holly Marten.

05:42.300 --> 05:44.256
Holly's dead?

05:44.427 --> 05:47.590
By Wen's hand.
It's a tragic loss.

05:47.764 --> 05:50.096
Look, I am here
to help you get
the others back.

05:50.267 --> 05:52.553
Allison, Zane,
all of them.

05:54.312 --> 05:57.804
Beverly, why would
we trust you?

05:58.316 --> 06:00.648
Because today
we're on the same team.

06:00.819 --> 06:02.810
You want to
save your friends
and so do I.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.609

(BIRDS CHIRPING)

06:35.729 --> 06:39.563

Disrupter test are minimal.

06:39.733 --> 06:42.270
Everything is
looking good.

06:47.657 --> 06:49.522
Except for that.

06:50.827 --> 06:53.819
Hey, uh,
check this out, the...

06:55.874 --> 06:58.866
Okay, that rock,
itjust had a bird on it.

07:01.463 --> 07:05.081
Um, I didn't
see anything.

07:06.635 --> 07:08.375
We should get going.

07:09.554 --> 07:10.464
Yeah.

07:12.474 --> 07:14.339
How did we get
a collision mesh error?

07:14.517 --> 07:17.350
The termination of
Dr. Marten should've
fixed the program,

07:17.520 --> 07:18.896
but it's still glitching.

07:19.064 --> 07:21.305
Donovan's
a computer programmer.

07:21.483 --> 07:24.065
If anyone else is
going to figure this out,
it's going to be him.

07:24.235 --> 07:26.191
We'll keep him from
pursuing it further.

07:28.239 --> 07:29.695
You better.

07:30.575 --> 07:32.861
I'd hate to have
to retire another one.

07:39.542 --> 07:41.954
Sheleﬁ.
No warning.
Just gone.

07:42.128 --> 07:43.459
Fargo, breathe,
what's going on?

07:44.464 --> 07:46.295
Holly dumped me.
By memo.

07:46.466 --> 07:49.082
Oh, even I
wouldn't do that.
I know. Right?

07:49.260 --> 07:50.670
Okay, what exactly
did she say?

07:50.845 --> 07:54.633
Just that she's flying
to DC today as
a permanent transfer,

07:54.808 --> 07:56.514
that she doesn't do the
long distance relationships.

07:56.685 --> 07:58.425
I mean, I keep calling her
but she's not answering.

07:58.603 --> 07:59.843
| just don't understand.

08:00.021 --> 08:01.010
Did I do
something wrong?

08:01.189 --> 08:04.181
Zane, you know women.
No, I thought I did.

08:05.527 --> 08:07.267
Now, not so much.

08:08.530 --> 08:10.395
Hey, sorry, Fargo,

08:10.573 --> 08:13.155
I couldn't help but overhear,
could I offer you an opinion?

08:13.326 --> 08:14.566
Uh, sure.

08:15.954 --> 08:20.664
I know this is hard,
but, um, let her go.

08:21.167 --> 08:21.952
You're a catch.

08:22.127 --> 08:23.617
There are lots of
eccentric geniuses in town

08:23.795 --> 08:25.831
who would love to
have a shot at you.

08:26.006 --> 08:28.418
Some of them even women.

08:28.591 --> 08:31.128
Really? That's your advice?

08:31.302 --> 08:32.803
What? Yeah,
I'm just trying to
give him perspective.

08:32.971 --> 08:34.757
I mean,
if Holly can't appreciate
what he has to offer,

08:34.931 --> 08:37.968
l... I say move on.
Life is short.

08:38.810 --> 08:41.176
Okay.
You're going to be late.

08:42.689 --> 08:45.726
Remind me to never
let you give Jenna
relationship advice.

08:45.900 --> 08:47.936
Fargo, I'm sorry.

08:48.319 --> 08:49.445
Yeah.

08:55.243 --> 08:56.483
(SIGHING)
All right.

08:57.454 --> 08:59.240
I really thought
she was the one.

09:01.207 --> 09:03.869
Well, when's her flight?
Maybe you still have time
to catch her at the airport.

09:04.044 --> 09:04.954
That's terrible advice.

09:05.128 --> 09:07.039
That is awesome advice,

09:07.213 --> 09:08.749
to show her
how much I love her.

09:08.923 --> 09:10.629
First, I'll need
some Peter Gabriel!

09:11.134 --> 09:12.123
Got to go!

09:13.887 --> 09:15.969
Oh.
What?

09:16.973 --> 09:18.679
Someone besides you
deserves to be happy.

09:19.142 --> 09:21.633
Shouldn't you be at G.D.
working on something for
the betterment of mankind?

09:21.811 --> 09:23.096
Actually I'm heading
out to the forest.

09:23.271 --> 09:24.226
I saw something
weird this morning

09:24.397 --> 09:26.058
that I can't wrap
my head around.

09:26.232 --> 09:27.392
But whatever.

09:27.567 --> 09:30.309
Eat your muffin.
I'll come with you.

09:34.407 --> 09:35.988
Better safe than sorry.

09:39.996 --> 09:42.237
If what
she's saying is crazy,
then I'll lock her up,

09:42.415 --> 09:43.825
but if what she's saying
is right about Senator Wen,

09:44.000 --> 09:45.365
and I think it is,

09:46.086 --> 09:47.371
then this may be
our only chance
to get the crew back.

09:47.545 --> 09:49.081
Jack, this is insane.

09:49.255 --> 09:51.211
You expect me
to trust her after
everything that she's done?

09:51.716 --> 09:53.252
We're running out of time.
May I continue?

09:53.426 --> 09:54.461
Don't push it.

09:55.261 --> 09:56.671
The crew's in
a mobile lab.

09:56.846 --> 09:59.633
I think I have a way
to locate it from
inside the program.

09:59.808 --> 10:02.140
Inside?
I know Wen's
remote access code.

10:02.310 --> 10:04.426
I can log on from here
and turn off the
engineer's ability

10:04.604 --> 10:05.593
to see what's happening.

10:05.772 --> 10:07.979
That will buy us time.
To do what?

10:08.149 --> 10:10.936
Jack you into the
program from here.
Why?

10:11.111 --> 10:12.396
Well, once you're inside,

10:12.570 --> 10:15.152
you can blow up
something big enough
to overheat the computer.

10:15.323 --> 10:16.312
We're thinking
the Astraeus.

10:16.825 --> 10:18.440
The original one.

10:18.618 --> 10:21.155
The mainframe has
a particular |.R. signature

10:21.329 --> 10:23.365
rendering a large
enough explosion
in the simulation

10:23.540 --> 10:25.576
should cause
a thermal surge in the
computer processors.

10:25.750 --> 10:28.492
Which would emit a
particular |.R. heat spike.

10:28.670 --> 10:30.661
And we can trace that
from the real world.

10:30.839 --> 10:32.420
We'll have
a security team
on standby,

10:33.007 --> 10:34.258
and once we
find the computer,

10:34.425 --> 10:35.585
we'll find the people
hooked up to it.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.000
Once you're in,
you'll have to be

10:37.178 --> 10:39.294
very careful
around the NPCs.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.133
What...uh, NPCs?

10:41.307 --> 10:45.266
Non-Player Characters,
anyone, anything that
is not a real person.

10:45.436 --> 10:47.688
The NPCs are programed
to stop the crew from

10:47.856 --> 10:49.812
figuring out they're
in a computer construct.

10:49.983 --> 10:52.269
With the engineers blinded,
they'll be put on high alert.

10:52.443 --> 10:54.399
If they realize
you're a threat,
they'll eliminate you.

10:54.571 --> 10:56.402
Eliminate like boot you
out of the program?

10:56.573 --> 10:58.438
I don't think that's
what she means, Jack.

11:00.076 --> 11:03.409
If you die in the program...
Yeah, you die here, too.

11:03.997 --> 11:05.032
Got it.

11:09.377 --> 11:10.583
I'll do it.

11:11.963 --> 11:13.874
I think I should go.
What?

11:14.048 --> 11:15.629
Uh, blowing stuff up is
something that I can do.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.336
If something
goes wrong here,

11:17.510 --> 11:18.374
we need a scientist.

11:18.553 --> 11:19.793
And Jo, you have to
lead the strike team.

11:19.971 --> 11:24.340
So... I think I should go.

11:29.105 --> 11:31.187
Should we get
started then?

11:36.362 --> 11:38.353
The bird came
from here, swooped down,

11:38.531 --> 11:40.988
straight back and
right through the rock.

11:42.368 --> 11:44.825
Well, it looks like
a perfectly normal rock.

11:45.622 --> 11:46.828
Right, oh.

11:47.540 --> 11:48.529
What?

11:50.376 --> 11:52.628
No. No. No stuck birds.

11:53.963 --> 11:55.169
Very funny.

11:55.340 --> 11:56.375
Wasn't exactly
stuck to it,

11:56.549 --> 11:57.459
it was more
like a videogame.

11:57.634 --> 12:00.000
Oh, I'm sure
there's a perfectly
reasonable explanation.

12:11.147 --> 12:14.105
This is going to be
a little tougher to explain.

12:17.111 --> 12:18.191
Zane!

12:24.953 --> 12:26.909
You know what to do?
Yeah.

12:27.580 --> 12:28.740
Wrote in on my hand.

12:29.916 --> 12:32.703
Carter, think about that
just for a second.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.544
Right.
Well, I'll memorize it.

12:37.215 --> 12:38.204
Okay.
(BEEPING)

12:38.383 --> 12:40.214
HENRY: Beverly just
blocked their visuals.

12:40.385 --> 12:45.345
We're, um, ready
to jack you in, Jack.

12:47.225 --> 12:48.431
Nice.

12:49.060 --> 12:51.426
Look, um, no matter
what happens to me,

12:51.604 --> 12:53.686
do not let Beverly
escape again.

12:54.274 --> 12:56.356
(SCOFFS) No argument there.

12:57.277 --> 12:58.141
All right.

12:58.778 --> 13:01.110
Right, so how does this
"matrix me" thing work?

13:01.281 --> 13:03.693
Have a seat, Sheriff.
Yeah. I figured.

13:03.866 --> 13:07.358
You'll replace the
NPC Jack Carter that's
already in the program.

13:07.537 --> 13:09.619
All the NPCs are
independent sub-routines.

13:09.789 --> 13:11.950
They'll only know
something's different
if you tip them off.

13:12.125 --> 13:13.410
So don't.

13:13.710 --> 13:14.324
Right. Okay.

13:14.877 --> 13:16.162
Blow the ship up quickly,

13:16.337 --> 13:18.544
once we see
the heat spike,
we'll pull you back.

13:19.382 --> 13:20.588
Right.

13:21.384 --> 13:23.249
| sort of wish
I'd played more videogames.

13:23.428 --> 13:24.793
Except in this one,
there are no extra lives,

13:24.971 --> 13:27.428
and we won't
have a way to see
what's going on in there.

13:27.598 --> 13:28.633
You'll be on your own.

13:28.808 --> 13:29.672
Great pep talk.

13:35.315 --> 13:36.646
One other thing.
Uh-huh.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.181
In the program,
you're dating Jo

13:38.359 --> 13:40.736
and raising Allison's kids
for the past few years.

13:40.903 --> 13:41.733
Yeah. What?

13:48.161 --> 13:48.820
Zane!

13:57.045 --> 14:01.835
Zane, wait,
whatever I did
to piss you off,

14:02.008 --> 14:02.963
it wasn't me.

14:03.134 --> 14:04.544
Okay, I know this is
going to sound crazy.

14:04.719 --> 14:06.675
We're in a
total emersion
simulation program?

14:08.765 --> 14:10.630
Yes.
Mmm-hmm.

14:10.808 --> 14:11.888
And you're a part of it.

14:12.060 --> 14:13.220
No, no, no, no, no! No.

14:13.394 --> 14:14.804
The me who was
here before was.

14:14.979 --> 14:17.516
The me who is here now,
this is, this is, is me.

14:17.690 --> 14:20.272
My, my body's actually
in Henry's garage.

14:20.443 --> 14:24.436
He had to, to jack me
to get at my MP3s.

14:24.614 --> 14:25.820
NPCs.
Yes, right!

14:25.990 --> 14:28.322
(STAMMERING)
Because what we have
to do is build a thing

14:28.493 --> 14:31.109
to blow up the ship
and then there's

14:31.287 --> 14:33.369
going to be
a heat spike
and then Henry,

14:33.539 --> 14:36.076
he can trace it with
Jo in the real world.

14:40.129 --> 14:41.164
Yeah.

14:41.547 --> 14:42.536
No computer
version of you

14:42.715 --> 14:43.955
could have come up with
something that incoherent.

14:44.133 --> 14:45.634
While you were holding
a gun in my face.

14:45.802 --> 14:48.259
But you were
trying to kill me.
What? Oh.

14:48.888 --> 14:51.004
It feels very real.
Mmm-hmm.

14:52.600 --> 14:54.591
Okay, so we're going
to try to blow up
the Astraeus?

14:54.769 --> 14:55.633
That's not
going to be easy.

14:55.812 --> 14:57.222
That ship was made
to take a pounding.

14:57.397 --> 15:00.230
I know. But that's why
I wrote on, on...

15:00.400 --> 15:01.685
Oh, I wrote, I wrote...

15:03.111 --> 15:03.725
Great.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.985
This is a virtual hand now.
Mmm-hmm.

15:06.155 --> 15:10.615
Um, it's, it's, um, ironic.
Mmm-mmm.

15:10.785 --> 15:12.696
I got this. That means
that's a different word.

15:12.870 --> 15:14.735
lt's, uh, bionic.

15:15.373 --> 15:16.783
(STAMMERING) Ionic.

15:16.958 --> 15:18.118
Resonator!
Yes!

15:18.292 --> 15:19.281
That could do it.
But we're going to need

15:19.460 --> 15:20.370
the others to
help us though.

15:20.545 --> 15:21.455
Okay, we'll tell them
to watch out.

15:21.629 --> 15:23.210
If the NPCs suspect us,
they will take us out.

15:23.381 --> 15:25.212
I know. I was
just dealing with one.

15:27.677 --> 15:28.917
It is really good
to see you, though.

15:29.387 --> 15:30.251
Thanks.

15:30.680 --> 15:32.011
Sorry.
It's all right.

15:33.015 --> 15:34.175
That really hurt.

15:51.993 --> 15:53.153
What the frak?

16:07.925 --> 16:08.914
Uh-oh.

16:12.305 --> 16:15.138
Program monitoring is
still offline, so we're
flying blind here.

16:15.308 --> 16:17.890
Could take hours to get
the visuals back up.

16:19.729 --> 16:21.515
I understand, Senator.

16:23.357 --> 16:27.020
Put the primary
NPC security settings
on highest alert.

16:27.820 --> 16:29.105
Can't take
any chances now.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.733
Allison. Allison.

16:35.912 --> 16:37.903
Oh. Oh. Hey.

16:38.372 --> 16:39.908
What? Carter,
have you lost your...

16:40.082 --> 16:41.618
No, it's not Carter.

16:41.792 --> 16:43.407
lt's Jack. It's me.

16:43.586 --> 16:46.828
Yes. And you are with Jo.
What is wrong with you?

16:47.006 --> 16:48.041
All of this is fake.

16:49.217 --> 16:51.674
The town, the people,
everything except for
the crew of the Astraeus,

16:52.178 --> 16:54.134
you and me.

16:54.889 --> 16:57.631
We're inside of
a computer program and
it hasn't been four years.

16:57.808 --> 16:58.797
It's been a month.

16:58.976 --> 17:00.091
I'm not seeing...

17:00.269 --> 17:02.260
(HI-PITCHED VOICE) Jo. Hi.

17:02.939 --> 17:04.349
How's it going, sweetheart?

17:04.524 --> 17:06.105
Okay.
Oh.

17:06.275 --> 17:08.266
Is everything...
Fine.

17:09.028 --> 17:11.735
I'm fine. Allison's fine.
Things are, things are...

17:11.906 --> 17:13.316
Fine.
Fine.

17:13.491 --> 17:15.573
Yeah, I don't know what...
(LAUGHS)

17:16.619 --> 17:19.076
She... Did you
say something? No.

17:19.247 --> 17:21.329
We were, we were,
um, just talking
about a work thing,

17:21.499 --> 17:24.411
and Allison, um,
you need to look
into that.

17:24.585 --> 17:27.076
So, um, we should go. Sorry.

17:28.047 --> 17:32.165
Yeah.
Jack, are we still on
for lunch at the house?

17:34.428 --> 17:35.508
You bet.

17:37.265 --> 17:38.846
Fist bump.
Here we go.

17:39.016 --> 17:40.267
Okay.
All right.

17:40.434 --> 17:41.423
Yeah.

17:41.602 --> 17:43.843
Now, um, as
you were saying,
we better go.

17:44.021 --> 17:45.272
Come on.

17:49.735 --> 17:51.350
This is the most
ridiculous thing
that I've ever heard.

17:51.529 --> 17:52.769
Allison, it's me, Jack.

17:52.947 --> 17:55.438
The, the, the real Jack
and I'm in love with you.

17:55.616 --> 17:56.856
I need you
to trust me.

17:57.034 --> 17:58.774
Do you trust me?
No.

18:00.079 --> 18:02.161
Really? I thought that
would go differently.

18:02.623 --> 18:05.490
Carter, adjusting
to this reality has
not been easy for me.

18:05.668 --> 18:07.579
Missing all these years
with my kids,
seeing you with Jo...

18:08.170 --> 18:10.252
This isn't reality.
l'm reality.

18:10.423 --> 18:12.379
This is
all the fake stuff.

18:12.550 --> 18:14.006
| wish that
I could believe that.

18:14.510 --> 18:15.716
Believe this.

18:24.645 --> 18:25.634
(CLEARS THROAT)

18:25.855 --> 18:27.436
GRACE: Hey, guys.

18:31.819 --> 18:33.855
Okay, guys, we have
most of the components

18:34.030 --> 18:35.770
for an ionic resonator
here at G.D.,

18:35.948 --> 18:37.859
but I'll have to get
the remote detonator
from Henry's garage.

18:38.034 --> 18:40.992
And we can power it
with the fuel cell from
SARAH's backup generator.

18:41.162 --> 18:46.452
Where's Fargo?
So, we really are lying
somewhere unconscious?

18:48.127 --> 18:50.334
Everything that
we've experienced
since the launch,

18:50.504 --> 18:52.040
none of that happened?

18:52.214 --> 18:54.375
You two
actually believe this?

18:54.550 --> 18:55.505
Yeah.

18:55.676 --> 18:57.667
When I got zapped
by Martha last month,

18:57.845 --> 19:01.008
I saw these
flashes of lights and
people standing over me.

19:01.182 --> 19:03.218
I thought it was
just a dream.

19:03.392 --> 19:05.769
Then I saw a collision
mesh error this morning

19:06.145 --> 19:07.681
and your boyfriend, he...
Other boyfriend.

19:07.855 --> 19:09.391
He "de-res-ed"
right in front of me.

19:09.565 --> 19:10.850
So, yeah,
I'm pretty convinced.

19:11.359 --> 19:13.691
So I haven't lost
all that time with
Kevin and Jenna?

19:13.861 --> 19:16.728
With you?
No. Some kiss though, huh?

19:16.906 --> 19:17.861
Great kiss.

19:18.032 --> 19:20.739
Guys, we're trapped
in the matrix.

19:20.910 --> 19:23.151
We know.
Well, you could have
told me in your message.

19:23.329 --> 19:24.990
We're going to
get you out of here.

19:25.164 --> 19:25.789
Not without Holly.

19:25.956 --> 19:27.662
It's impossible
to leave the town,

19:27.833 --> 19:29.118
so she's got to
be here somewhere.

19:29.293 --> 19:30.794
And I'm not going
anywhere without her.

19:35.591 --> 19:37.798
Fargo, there's something
you should know.

19:38.386 --> 19:43.221
Uh, Holly's already out.

19:44.558 --> 19:45.343
Are you sure?

19:47.061 --> 19:48.050
Yeah.

19:49.021 --> 19:50.557
That's my girl.

20:14.130 --> 20:15.336
(GASPS)

20:16.674 --> 20:18.585
I'm disappointed.

20:18.759 --> 20:21.250
You know, Grace, we, um...

20:25.891 --> 20:27.847
We don't talk
much anymore.

20:31.439 --> 20:33.270
I think it's time
to catch up.

20:36.360 --> 20:39.318
You're right.
Uh, we really
should catch up.

20:39.488 --> 20:43.447
Um, how about,
say, dinner tonight?

20:43.617 --> 20:47.576
Right now, though,
I really have to
meet Allison.

20:47.747 --> 20:49.112
(DOOR RATTLING)

20:52.626 --> 20:56.460
Yeah, you know, um,
I think you should call her.

21:00.301 --> 21:01.962
You're not
going to make it.

21:09.685 --> 21:10.640
Wow.

21:13.314 --> 21:15.475
This is my exact bat!

21:15.649 --> 21:19.483
Like, are you telling me
that Beverly got
all of this information

21:19.653 --> 21:21.518
from inside the
G.D. computers?

21:22.531 --> 21:25.614
The G.D. personnel files
are very comprehensive.

21:27.161 --> 21:28.526
Oh.

21:30.080 --> 21:31.035
Look at me.

21:31.457 --> 21:32.913
l'm coaching
Jenna's T-ball.

21:33.459 --> 21:34.995
I would
totally do that!

21:35.169 --> 21:38.753
That's Kevin's
graduation, and...

21:47.056 --> 21:52.346
This is un-real.

21:54.855 --> 21:56.356
I thought
I heard you come in.

21:56.524 --> 21:58.014
Yeah.

21:59.068 --> 22:00.683
That's me.

22:02.446 --> 22:04.607
I love our
lunches at home.

22:04.782 --> 22:06.022
(MOANS)

22:07.618 --> 22:08.733
Yeah.

22:10.037 --> 22:14.246
How about I spread out
a picnic in the bedroom?

22:15.376 --> 22:19.085
Ah! Oh! We got...
We got company.

22:21.048 --> 22:22.754
Well, he'll have
to wait downstairs.

22:23.717 --> 22:25.924
(STAMMERING)
Yeah. Oh. You!

22:26.428 --> 22:28.510
What's the matter, Jack?

22:28.681 --> 22:29.841
You don't like
what you see?

22:30.224 --> 22:35.890
Yeah. I'm, I'm all about
the eye contact...

22:36.355 --> 22:39.939
lt's... Yeah, but actually,
Fargo said that I got
to drive him to work,

22:40.109 --> 22:43.567
which is urgent,
so sort of a rock
and a hard place.

22:43.737 --> 22:45.352
You know, "Oh, Fargo!"

22:45.739 --> 22:50.278
Got it! We can take...
our own sweet time.

22:50.452 --> 22:51.658
There's no rush.

22:52.121 --> 22:54.783
We can get back
to picnicking later.

22:55.291 --> 22:56.576
I can't wait!

22:58.127 --> 22:59.617
Yeah. Ah! Bye.

23:03.215 --> 23:05.206
The attention to
detail is astounding.

23:05.384 --> 23:06.419
CARTER: Stop staring.

23:08.220 --> 23:09.426
It's hard not to.

23:18.188 --> 23:19.894
My team has a chopper
ready to move out.

23:20.065 --> 23:21.726
I want to be in the air
when you get
those coordinates.

23:21.901 --> 23:23.607
Make sure you trust them.
If Wen finds out...

23:23.777 --> 23:27.770
They're my team.
And my trust
doesn't come easy.

23:28.782 --> 23:30.067
You okay alone?

23:30.868 --> 23:31.857
Yeah.

23:37.291 --> 23:40.783
Henry, I know trusting me
can't be easy for you.

23:40.961 --> 23:43.498
I don't trust you.

23:44.131 --> 23:46.167
I never intended
to hurt them.

23:46.342 --> 23:47.923
I wanted their ideas,
not their lives.

23:48.093 --> 23:49.299
I would have sent
the crew home,

23:49.470 --> 23:50.801
and it all would have
been a bad dream.

23:50.971 --> 23:51.596
Wen changed that.

23:52.097 --> 23:55.009
Don't try to justify
your actions with me
because you can't.

23:55.184 --> 23:57.846
I know you've struggled
with Eureka's mission, Henry.

23:58.020 --> 24:00.261
Look, Einstein himself said
we cannot simultaneously

24:00.439 --> 24:01.679
prepare for peace
and for war.

24:01.857 --> 24:03.939
We need balance
in the world.

24:04.652 --> 24:06.859
Think of what's
at stake, Henry.

24:07.529 --> 24:09.315
Philosophically,
we're not that different.

24:09.823 --> 24:12.439
Their lives are at stake,
and that's all
I care about right now.

24:12.618 --> 24:14.154
And it's the only reason
you're still breathing.

24:14.328 --> 24:18.287
And do not ever
compare yourself
to me again.

24:42.690 --> 24:44.681
Grace was delayed by Henry.
If he suspects something...

24:44.858 --> 24:45.847
She'll cover.

24:49.113 --> 24:51.069
We still need
the remote detonator.
It won't work.

24:51.240 --> 24:54.152
No, it'll work.
You'll just have to
activate it manually.

24:55.119 --> 24:55.983
Manually?

24:56.161 --> 24:57.776
Stuff this baby
into the engine core,

24:57.955 --> 25:00.321
flip that switch and then
get the hell out of Dodge.

25:00.499 --> 25:02.911
Wow. How much time
between the switch flipping

25:03.085 --> 25:04.450
and the fireball
of destruction?

25:04.628 --> 25:06.334
I could rig
a detonation delay.

25:06.505 --> 25:09.622
That should buy you
10, 12 seconds.

25:11.927 --> 25:13.588
No problem.

25:48.005 --> 25:49.120
Hi there, Sheriff.

25:50.549 --> 25:51.914
Business on the premises?

25:52.092 --> 25:55.175
What, um...
(CHUCKLES) Funny thing...

25:55.721 --> 25:57.507
The, um, uh...
I got nothing!

25:58.682 --> 25:59.888
(BEEPING)

26:05.147 --> 26:06.887
We have a security breach
in pod five!

26:36.804 --> 26:37.759
There.

26:37.930 --> 26:39.636
They're on the Columbia,
headed out to sea.

26:39.807 --> 26:41.513
That's got to be them.
It worked.

26:41.683 --> 26:44.595
Jo, we found them.
I'm uploading
the coordinates.

26:45.229 --> 26:47.265
JO: I got it. I'm tracking
the heat signatures.

26:47.439 --> 26:50.306
You're about
an hour out.

26:51.235 --> 26:52.350
Not the way I fly!

26:58.033 --> 26:59.148
We're still flying blind.

26:59.701 --> 27:02.989
The overheating is
causing a system-wide
cascade failure.

27:03.163 --> 27:04.073
Should I pull the crew?

27:04.248 --> 27:05.237
WEN: No. No.

27:05.415 --> 27:08.202
Our only concern is
salvaging the program.

27:08.377 --> 27:10.117
And if it fails
with them inside?

27:10.295 --> 27:12.752
Then the crew's loss
is on Beverly.

27:12.923 --> 27:15.335
We can't have this
coming back to haunt us.

27:15.509 --> 27:17.921
Dump the container overboard
and save the data.

27:18.095 --> 27:19.426
Understood.

27:19.596 --> 27:22.087
We're going to need
to shut down all
non-essential systems,

27:22.266 --> 27:24.757
so I'd have to log you
out of the program.

27:24.935 --> 27:25.799
But I'm not logged in.

27:25.978 --> 27:30.517
Someone's using your
log-in code from
a Eureka IP address.

27:31.984 --> 27:33.645
That clever bitch.

27:34.444 --> 27:35.194
What the...

27:35.362 --> 27:36.898
All right, now get Jack
the hell out of there.

27:37.281 --> 27:40.523
I'm trying. I can't.
What are you
trying to pull?

27:40.701 --> 27:43.113
Someone severed my link
to the neural computer.

27:43.287 --> 27:44.902
Well, there's got to be
another way to get him
out of there.

27:45.080 --> 27:47.446
Not safely. l have
to eject him from
within the system.

27:47.624 --> 27:49.410
Any other way
could be fatal.

27:59.011 --> 27:59.966
Jack.
Hi.

28:00.137 --> 28:02.219
Are you okay?
Yeah. Relatively.

28:02.389 --> 28:04.471
Ten to 12 seconds.

28:05.559 --> 28:07.766
Have we got our
heat spike?
Yeah, you bet we did.

28:07.936 --> 28:09.142
We broke the matrix.

28:17.446 --> 28:19.983
We really
broke the matrix.

28:25.537 --> 28:27.198
CARTER: So I take it,
this wasn't
supposed to happen?

28:27.372 --> 28:28.236
ZANE: Yeah, you think?

28:28.415 --> 28:31.498
Run! The entire program is
"de-res-ing" with us inside!

28:31.668 --> 28:33.283
We must have created
a cascade failure.

28:33.462 --> 28:34.668
If that void
reaches us,
we're dead!

28:34.838 --> 28:36.453
So, run is sort of
a short-term plan then?

28:36.632 --> 28:37.792
Well, we have
to slow it down.

28:37.966 --> 28:38.921
Give Jo time
to get us out.

28:39.092 --> 28:41.344
Wait, wait,
the computer world
only renders areas

28:41.511 --> 28:43.763
that we're looking at,
so we need to make
those areas smaller.

28:43.931 --> 28:46.388
Right. So if we gather
the entire Astraeus crew
to the same place,

28:46.558 --> 28:47.673
the program won't have
to render the whole town.

28:47.851 --> 28:49.091
And the computer won't
have to work as hard,

28:49.269 --> 28:50.554
which should slow down
the "de-res-ing" process.

28:50.729 --> 28:52.060
All right,
but the crew's
at Global, right?

28:52.231 --> 28:53.346
We get them
to the rotunda.
Yes.

28:53.523 --> 28:55.263
Let's roll.
Grace! She's still
with Henry!

28:55.442 --> 28:56.477
All right,
I'll get Grace.
Okay, careful.

28:56.652 --> 28:57.983
Hey, hey, hey.

28:58.779 --> 28:59.768
Be careful.

29:07.996 --> 29:10.112
Henry, um,
I really have to go.

29:10.290 --> 29:13.407
For your
geological detonation?

29:16.463 --> 29:17.623
Yes.

29:18.924 --> 29:19.913
You're lying.

29:22.219 --> 29:24.426
Uh, you're right.

29:24.596 --> 29:28.680
Actually, um,
I'm working on
a new project.

29:29.142 --> 29:30.222
But it's a surprise.

29:31.436 --> 29:35.270
Uh, and l have
a surprise for you.

29:37.693 --> 29:39.934
I don't think that this...

29:43.824 --> 29:49.535
...relationship is
going to work out.

29:52.082 --> 29:54.448
Henry! Don't move!

29:56.962 --> 30:01.080
Jack. Uh, what's wrong?

30:02.175 --> 30:03.460
(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)

30:03.635 --> 30:04.966
(GROANS)

30:06.972 --> 30:08.553
Oh, God.
That was
a little unsettling.

30:08.724 --> 30:09.930
You okay?
Not even close.

30:10.100 --> 30:11.089
Let's go.

30:16.315 --> 30:18.681
Just trust me!
Go to the rotunda now!

30:18.859 --> 30:19.564
Go!

30:31.121 --> 30:33.954
Looks like you and l
have a problem.

30:34.541 --> 30:35.246
Big time.

30:37.294 --> 30:38.374
(GRUNTS)

30:40.505 --> 30:42.837
I could keep
batting you around

30:43.008 --> 30:46.171
like a helpless
little mouse.

30:46.345 --> 30:49.587
But I am tired of
playing with my food.

31:00.859 --> 31:02.065
(SCREAMS)

31:10.535 --> 31:11.524
Bet that felt good.

31:14.331 --> 31:15.696
It didn't suck.

31:16.625 --> 31:17.705
Oh, my God.

31:23.632 --> 31:25.213
Oh, my, thank God
you guys made it.

31:25.384 --> 31:26.464
Barely.
Are you okay?

31:26.635 --> 31:27.590
Yeah. Yeah I'm fine.

31:27.761 --> 31:29.376
Eureka's coming apart
at the seams.

31:29.554 --> 31:30.805
Yeah, waiting
to be rescued
is not an option.

31:30.972 --> 31:32.303
This is a nightmare.

31:32.474 --> 31:33.634
(LOW RUMBLING)

31:34.309 --> 31:36.345
You're right. That's it.

31:36.520 --> 31:37.555
All we have to do
is wake up,

31:37.729 --> 31:39.344
the same way that
Zane woke up when
Martha shocked him.

31:40.232 --> 31:41.096
Right.

31:41.274 --> 31:44.562
Okay. A big enough shock
could have disrupted
the electrical impulses

31:44.736 --> 31:46.522
between Zane's brain
and the matrix computer.

31:46.696 --> 31:48.903
So, so there might be
a way to completely
eject from the inside?

31:49.074 --> 31:51.565
But Zane was lucky that
he didn't get electrocuted.

31:51.743 --> 31:53.859
You could wake up
for a second or
never wake up again.

31:54.037 --> 31:55.743
| feel lucky,
and when I wake up,

31:55.914 --> 31:56.744
I can get all of you out.

31:56.915 --> 31:58.701
But you're not with us
in the real world.

31:59.292 --> 32:00.077
Small issue.

32:01.336 --> 32:02.086
I'll do it.

32:02.254 --> 32:04.745
I'll do it. Jinx.
Justjoking.

32:04.923 --> 32:07.255
You go it, so lucky you.

32:08.927 --> 32:09.916
Hit me.

32:11.888 --> 32:13.094
Hit me.

32:18.728 --> 32:19.763
(GRUNTS)

32:58.185 --> 32:59.300
(GUN CLICKING)

32:59.644 --> 33:01.145
Going somewhere?

33:06.485 --> 33:07.474
Move in.

33:09.488 --> 33:10.227
To the left.

33:10.405 --> 33:11.941
Hey, remember me?

33:16.411 --> 33:18.197
We got to get
the others out.

33:18.371 --> 33:20.453
Give me a hand
to that control panel.

33:20.624 --> 33:21.784
| feel kind of limp here.

33:21.958 --> 33:24.370
I'm going to
let that one go.

33:25.086 --> 33:26.166
I missed you, JoJo.

33:34.179 --> 33:35.385
Anytime, Zane!

33:35.555 --> 33:36.840
If he even
got out alive!

33:37.015 --> 33:38.004
Jack, what about you?

33:38.183 --> 33:39.844
Well, Henry and Beverly
are working on it.

33:40.018 --> 33:41.758
Well, Henry is.

33:43.396 --> 33:44.385
Damn it.

33:44.564 --> 33:46.896
Try something else.
You have to reestablish
a connection to him.

33:47.067 --> 33:49.353
I am doing everything
I can. Trust me.

33:49.861 --> 33:52.068
Beverly! Stop! Stop!

33:52.447 --> 33:55.689
Dr. Deacon,
I don't know what
Miss Barlowe has told you,

33:55.867 --> 33:57.573
but we just recovered
the bodies of the crew.

33:58.328 --> 34:01.195
The invasive
neurological experiment
she was performing

34:01.373 --> 34:02.488
left no survivors.

34:02.666 --> 34:03.906
She is lying, Henry.

34:04.084 --> 34:05.870
This is our only chance
to get everyone out.

34:06.044 --> 34:09.286
Henry, whatever
she did to your wife
and the rest of the crew,

34:09.464 --> 34:10.829
she is doing
to Sheriff Carter.

34:11.007 --> 34:12.463
We have to unhook him
from all this...

34:12.634 --> 34:14.750
If you do that,
he will die.

34:16.263 --> 34:18.925
Henry, that is how
she killed Holly Marten.

34:22.060 --> 34:23.175
Can't we just
unplug them?

34:23.353 --> 34:25.639
No. It's like
ejecting a flash drive
on the computer.

34:25.814 --> 34:27.930
You can't just
yank it out or...

34:28.108 --> 34:29.564
Fatal system error.

34:30.318 --> 34:32.980
Henry, think about
everything that this woman

34:33.154 --> 34:36.112
has done to you,
all the lies
that she's told.

34:36.283 --> 34:38.990
Do you really think
that she has the Sheriff's
interests at heart?

34:41.830 --> 34:43.616
I'm going to
arrest her now.

34:43.790 --> 34:46.657
Please don't force me
to arrest you too.

34:50.880 --> 34:52.666
Okay. Just wait.

34:53.842 --> 34:57.050
Uh, before
you do that,
Beverly, duck!

35:06.605 --> 35:09.096
Jack, just don't let go!
Never.

35:10.734 --> 35:12.690
Love it when you
call me Jack.

35:22.037 --> 35:23.197
Welcome back, Allison.

35:23.371 --> 35:24.451
Jack is still in there.

35:24.623 --> 35:26.739
He doesn't have much time.
Can you get him out?

35:26.916 --> 35:28.577
No, he's integrated
at a different source.

35:29.002 --> 35:30.367
He has to be
ejected from there.

35:30.545 --> 35:32.160
Henry, come in.
We have the crew.

35:32.339 --> 35:33.579
ls Carter okay?

35:35.008 --> 35:35.633
Henry?

35:36.843 --> 35:37.673
JO: He's not answering.

35:39.054 --> 35:41.170
JO: Henry, do you copy?

35:42.182 --> 35:43.422
Beverly!

35:44.643 --> 35:46.975
Henry, can you hear me?

35:49.064 --> 35:52.682
Can anyone hear me?
Can you copy, please?

35:54.235 --> 35:55.566
BEVERLY: I'm here, Jo.

35:55.737 --> 35:57.853
Log me back on and
I'll pull Sheriff Carter out.

35:58.031 --> 36:00.818
You take this one.
Go ahead.

36:08.958 --> 36:10.289
Henry, anytime now!

36:10.460 --> 36:11.119
Anytime now!

36:18.176 --> 36:18.835
Whoa!

36:19.010 --> 36:20.216
(SCREAMING)

36:31.439 --> 36:32.724
(GROANING)

36:45.036 --> 36:47.027
Henry. Henry, you okay?

36:47.205 --> 36:49.161
You okay?
Oh, hey!

36:49.332 --> 36:50.833
:Lz’éi'éiiéé
fang»?

36:51.000 --> 36:52.035
Welcome back.
Thanks.

36:52.210 --> 36:53.370
What about the others?

36:53.545 --> 36:55.456
They got out.
What happened here?

36:55.630 --> 37:00.169
Uh, I had to.
I had to trust Beverly
with your life.

37:00.552 --> 37:02.543
She got you out, Jack.
Where is she?

37:04.973 --> 37:05.962
Don't know.

37:06.808 --> 37:07.797
You...

37:08.643 --> 37:10.144
| asked you to do
one simple thing.

37:10.311 --> 37:11.437
Hey.
One.

37:19.946 --> 37:21.777
I call next on the phone.

37:22.323 --> 37:24.063
Holly must be worried sick.

37:28.079 --> 37:29.410
Can you just...

37:30.415 --> 37:33.907
Hey, Fargo, why don't you
take a little walk with me?

37:34.085 --> 37:36.542
Yeah, I don't think so.

37:37.088 --> 37:39.329
My legs ain't
working so well.

37:42.427 --> 37:44.588
Yeah. It's okay.

37:46.055 --> 37:47.591
l'll hold you up.

38:20.131 --> 38:22.167
Welcome back, Captain.
Sorry about the mess.

38:22.342 --> 38:24.128
We're still
under construction.

38:24.302 --> 38:26.338
Planked fig with
pancetta and goat cheese?

38:26.513 --> 38:27.798
Sounds wonderful.

38:27.972 --> 38:29.428
Thank you.
You're welcome.

38:33.144 --> 38:34.554
Could you stop
grinning at me?

38:34.729 --> 38:35.809
It's kind of
freaking me out.

38:35.980 --> 38:39.973
Oh, come on, Grace,
now when could this face
ever freak you out?

38:48.159 --> 38:49.865
Still feeling limp?

38:51.663 --> 38:52.743
Funny.

38:53.498 --> 38:55.989
I heard you cut
your walkabout short
because of us.

38:56.167 --> 38:58.283
So, you going to
head back out?

38:59.796 --> 39:01.002
We'll see.

39:01.506 --> 39:02.495
Oh, yeah?

39:03.550 --> 39:05.791
Well... I'll drinkto
"we'll see."

39:09.514 --> 39:11.345
Still haven't got
the squeezing out of
your system, have you?

39:11.516 --> 39:14.178
Sorry. I'm just happy
to have my family back.

39:14.352 --> 39:17.469
My very young, young family.

39:17.647 --> 39:20.013
Well, we're happy
not to be old,
aren't we, Jenna?

39:20.191 --> 39:21.727
(LAUGHS)

39:22.443 --> 39:23.694
It's nice to have
things back to normal.

39:23.862 --> 39:25.568
Yes, normal.

39:26.573 --> 39:29.155
How is the happy
reunited couple?

39:30.326 --> 39:31.315
Happy.

39:32.453 --> 39:33.784
Okay.
Okay.

39:34.205 --> 39:35.445
How are you doing?
Good!

39:35.623 --> 39:37.488
I got to get
drinks! I got...

39:42.046 --> 39:43.297
There you go.
Thanks.

39:48.219 --> 39:49.629
Sorry. One sec.

39:51.139 --> 39:52.504
Hey, Andy.
Hey, boss.

39:53.141 --> 39:53.891
You okay?

39:55.226 --> 39:56.636
| just don't understand.

39:56.811 --> 39:58.051
Everyone on the crew
seems to be afraid of me.

39:58.229 --> 40:00.515
Did I do
something wrong?

40:02.108 --> 40:04.474
No. I think it'll pass.

40:04.652 --> 40:08.895
Sometimes it just takes
people a little while
to adjust to...

40:12.243 --> 40:13.483
To reality.

40:16.080 --> 40:17.069
Would you excuse me
for a sec?

40:17.248 --> 40:18.363
Okay.

40:34.849 --> 40:36.180
Hey, Fargo.

40:38.144 --> 40:39.475
You lied to me.

40:43.816 --> 40:45.727
l was trying
to protect you

40:45.902 --> 40:48.109
until we got back. Uh...

40:51.366 --> 40:52.446
Sorry.

40:52.617 --> 40:54.403
But I couldn't protect her.

40:56.037 --> 40:57.322
I know.

41:00.875 --> 41:02.456
Neither could I.

41:47.839 --> 41:49.704
You put me in here.

41:49.882 --> 41:51.463
It seemed appropriate.

41:52.093 --> 41:54.004
Are you really that naive?

41:54.470 --> 41:57.177
I'm a US senator and
you're a wanted felon.

41:58.016 --> 42:00.428
No one's going to take
your word over mine.

42:00.601 --> 42:02.102
l'm untouchable.

42:02.770 --> 42:03.759
I know.

42:26.377 --> 42:27.332
Hello?

43:05.833 --> 43:09.792
