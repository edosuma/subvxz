00:00.467 --> 00:03.469
Previously on
"Hunting Hitler"...

00:03.570 --> 00:07.673
This is from June 12th, 1945.

00:07.775 --> 00:11.611
At this time, the decision had been taken
to divide the ministries in two parts

00:11.713 --> 00:14.347
and establish one government in
the north and one in the south.

00:14.449 --> 00:17.450
What this file tells me
is they're splitting up,

00:17.552 --> 00:20.152
creating multiple escape routes.

00:26.094 --> 00:29.028
Tim found both the U-boat and
the seaplane near each other.

00:29.130 --> 00:33.165
Look at this.
OSS, predecessor of the CIA.

00:33.267 --> 00:39.038
"I have spoken about refuelling
seaplanes from U-boats."

00:39.140 --> 00:44.043
What these U-boats are are gasoline
stations in the middle of the Atlantic.

00:44.145 --> 00:47.880
This document opens up a whole new set of
options for Hitler to get out of Europe.

00:47.982 --> 00:51.384
This is the logical end
of the northern route.

00:51.486 --> 00:53.886
We now have to figure out
whether the southern route

00:53.988 --> 00:56.188
would've also gotten him
to South America.

00:58.593 --> 01:04.163
The Red Cross was actually producing
legitimate documents with false identities.

01:04.265 --> 01:06.565
The documents were something
that was secure,

01:06.668 --> 01:10.002
so if they had those documents,
they could easily get out of Rome.

01:10.104 --> 01:12.905
Once they'd got a real
passport, they're home free.

01:13.007 --> 01:16.142
This is the last piece of the puzzle,
then. All roads lead to Rome,

01:16.244 --> 01:18.744
and then from there
to Buenos Aires.

01:25.153 --> 01:27.653
We've established
two routes, and they worked.

01:27.755 --> 01:30.256
We're talking about thousands
upon thousands of Nazis

01:30.358 --> 01:32.658
who got out using
one of these two routes.

01:32.760 --> 01:39.031
21-year CIA veteran Bob Baer and former
terrorist targeting officer Nada Bakos

01:39.133 --> 01:43.669
are using an asset-mapping strategy,
tracking Hitler's known associates

01:43.771 --> 01:47.273
to pinpoint where he could
have gone after the war.

01:47.375 --> 01:51.343
After investigating across
four countries in Europe,

01:51.446 --> 01:55.715
the team has found two well-organized
and highly sophisticated escape routes

01:55.817 --> 01:58.884
that could have been used to get
Hitler safely to South America...

01:58.986 --> 02:03.589
One to the north through Norway
and one to the south through Italy.

02:03.691 --> 02:07.293
The core of this story is,
had Hitler gotten out,

02:07.395 --> 02:09.294
he could have made it
to South America.

02:09.396 --> 02:13.599
Hitler could have taken either the
northern or the southern escape routes.

02:13.701 --> 02:15.968
What we found in Europe
was extraordinary.

02:16.070 --> 02:20.806
These routes were planned to perfection,
and they were all organized

02:20.908 --> 02:24.376
to get Hitler and senior Nazis
to Argentina.

02:24.479 --> 02:27.313
We showed that,
if Hitler got to South America,

02:27.415 --> 02:30.783
he would have had multiple
safe houses in Argentina.

02:30.885 --> 02:35.755
Previously in the investigation, Bob and
the team uncovered multiple locations

02:35.857 --> 02:39.925
that Hitler could have used to hide
within the interior of Argentina,

02:40.027 --> 02:41.961
one in Misiones...

02:42.063 --> 02:46.465
You have observation posts,
structures, defense positions.

02:46.567 --> 02:51.270
This is way more than a hideout in the
jungle. and another in Bariloche.

02:52.774 --> 02:54.940
It's perfect for a high-value target.

02:55.042 --> 02:57.309
Looks like a little guard shack.

02:57.411 --> 03:01.347
You put a machine gun right there,
you can cover this entire body of water,

03:01.449 --> 03:02.615
and nothing could get through.

03:02.717 --> 03:07.353
We've looked into Argentina, but we
have not been looking at Buenos Aires.

03:07.455 --> 03:09.421
That is the end of the route.

03:09.524 --> 03:13.159
For me, Buenos Aires
is still a question mark.

03:13.261 --> 03:16.662
Adolf Eichmann, we know,
gets captured up there.

03:16.764 --> 03:21.200
In 1950, Adolf Eichmann fled
to Buenos Aires, Argentina,

03:21.302 --> 03:25.504
where he lived in a modest house and
worked as a foreman for Mercedes-Benz

03:25.606 --> 03:28.340
under the alias
Ricardo Klement.

03:28.442 --> 03:32.144
Essentially, living in the open,
he felt safe.

03:32.246 --> 03:33.879
What were the
Nazis doing there?

03:33.981 --> 03:35.514
What's the connection?

03:35.616 --> 03:38.384
We'd never really looked at any
of the reports from there,

03:38.486 --> 03:40.052
and I think it's time we do.

03:40.154 --> 03:43.155
Let's do a search...
Nazis, Buenos Aires.

03:45.726 --> 03:50.362
We have a report
from March 24, 2015.

03:50.464 --> 03:55.367
"In Laguna de Rocha, a seaplane
had to make an emergency landing

03:55.469 --> 04:00.539
on October 31, 1945,
then continued to Buenos Aires.

04:00.641 --> 04:03.075
Incognito, it was rumoured

04:03.177 --> 04:06.979
there were former Nazi officials
and a cargo of gold on board."

04:07.081 --> 04:08.747
We have a seaplane.

04:08.850 --> 04:13.552
Supposedly, it's got Nazis on it
and a cargo of gold on board,

04:13.654 --> 04:15.621
and then they go
to Buenos Aires.

04:15.723 --> 04:17.790
This is totally incredible.

04:17.892 --> 04:20.091
Here's Laguna de Rocha.

04:20.194 --> 04:22.127
Here's Buenos Aires.

04:22.230 --> 04:24.797
It's 230 miles.

04:24.899 --> 04:26.699
We're connecting the dots.

04:26.801 --> 04:28.400
We know we have
a seaplane in Norway.

04:28.502 --> 04:29.635
We found it.

04:29.737 --> 04:33.472
If this report turns out to be true,
we know where the seaplanes are going.

04:33.574 --> 04:35.574
They're going to Buenos Aires.

04:35.676 --> 04:39.478
I'm interested in why they think there
were former Nazi officials on board.

04:39.580 --> 04:41.480
We have to get
to the bottom of this story.

04:41.582 --> 04:44.149
I want some evidence this
plane really did land there

04:44.252 --> 04:50.556
and if there were Nazis and gold on this
airplane, or is it just more mythology?

04:50.658 --> 04:52.424
We need to get the team
to Laguna de Rocha

04:52.526 --> 04:54.326
to see if there's anybody
they can talk to.

04:54.428 --> 05:00.232
We keep coming back to Argentina,
and now we're coming back in a big way.

05:02.000 --> 05:08.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:10.945 --> 05:13.078
Everything coming out of Europe,

05:13.180 --> 05:16.115
whether it's the northern
route line, southern route line,

05:16.217 --> 05:19.418
everything comes back
into Buenos Aires. Yeah.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.921
U.S. Army Special Forces
Tim Kennedy,

05:22.023 --> 05:26.926
U.S. Army Green Beret Mike Simpson,
and their local contact, Dante,

05:27.028 --> 05:32.464
Land in Laguna de Rocha, Uruguay, where
a seaplane carrying high-ranking Nazis

05:32.566 --> 05:35.000
was rumoured to have made
an emergency landing.

05:35.102 --> 05:37.169
This has to be
the lagoon right here.

05:37.271 --> 05:39.471
Yep.

05:39.573 --> 05:41.273
It is a very real possibility

05:41.375 --> 05:44.443
that even Adolf Hitler could
have arrived in South America

05:44.545 --> 05:46.111
on a plane just like this.

05:46.213 --> 05:49.348
We're going to investigate to determine
if the seaplane did, in fact,

05:49.450 --> 05:54.553
make an emergency landing here in Uruguay
and see if there's any possibility

05:54.655 --> 05:57.957
that there were any Nazis
using this seaplane to escape.

05:58.059 --> 05:59.825
Let's go talk to him.

05:59.927 --> 06:02.628
The team makes contact with Don Tito,

06:02.730 --> 06:07.666
a local resident who lives only 500 yards
away from the alleged landing site

06:07.768 --> 06:10.602
and who claims to have
witnessed the crash first hand.

06:10.705 --> 06:15.541
We were told that you were
a witness to an airplane,

06:15.643 --> 06:18.444
a seaplane crash that
happened in the lagoon.

06:18.546 --> 06:21.780
How old were you
when the plane crashed?

06:27.455 --> 06:31.357
Can you tell us everything that you
remember about when that plane crashed?

06:39.000 --> 06:42.301
He remembers
there was a crash and a splash.

06:42.403 --> 06:47.906
He has the image and the sound of that,
and he says he saw it from here,

06:48.009 --> 06:51.377
from this place,
two blocks that way.

06:57.018 --> 06:58.517
Around 40 and 50.

06:58.619 --> 06:59.885
Okay.
- 50 passengers.

06:59.987 --> 07:01.920
And they were mainly German.

07:04.425 --> 07:08.093
The local enforcement took
a very quick action on it,

07:08.195 --> 07:12.531
and they had ambulance
waiting for them on the shore.

07:14.301 --> 07:18.105
So, without the aid of cellphones,
they responded very, very quickly.

07:18.205 --> 07:19.738
Do I have that right?

07:19.840 --> 07:24.176
The local enforcement
appeared very quickly. Yes.

07:24.278 --> 07:29.715
He remembers this plane
coming towards the lagoon

07:29.817 --> 07:34.420
followed by three...
Tres aviÃ³nes?

07:34.522 --> 07:38.123
By three little planes
like a convoy

07:38.225 --> 07:40.426
trying to rescue
or guide them to the lagoon.

07:42.730 --> 07:46.098
What kind of a commercial
plane flies with an escort?

07:46.200 --> 07:48.700
The fact that there were three
planes accompanying the seaplane

07:48.803 --> 07:50.469
is something I find
very interesting.

07:50.571 --> 07:53.972
This tells me this was not
a typical airliner of any sort.

07:54.075 --> 07:55.441
This was something important

07:55.543 --> 07:58.610
possibly containing
a high-value target.

07:58.712 --> 08:01.780
Have you ever heard
that there were Nazis

08:01.882 --> 08:04.716
or Nazi gold on this airplane?

08:12.426 --> 08:16.228
He cannot say
or confirm that's true.

08:17.898 --> 08:24.303
Do you personally believe that these
men that were on the plane were Nazis

08:24.405 --> 08:26.238
or that there was Nazi gold?

08:30.945 --> 08:33.479
No.
- He can't get into that,

08:33.581 --> 08:40.054
but one of the passengers had
bodyguards, and that's all he recalls.

08:41.956 --> 08:44.022
I mean, he's afraid.

08:44.125 --> 08:46.825
He's scared even after
all these years.

08:46.927 --> 08:50.529
This is something that we have seen
time and time again in this investigation.

08:50.631 --> 08:54.700
People don't want to talk about it.
Even 70 years after the war has ended,

08:54.802 --> 08:57.503
people are still scared
to talk about Nazis.

08:57.605 --> 09:01.073
For Mike and I,
this is the biggest red flag.

09:01.175 --> 09:07.581
In 1945, if you have 40 people on a
seaplane with bodyguards and escort,

09:09.383 --> 09:16.054
this couldn't be anybody but the highest
level, upper echelon of the Nazi Party.

09:16.157 --> 09:18.690
If we can find something
physical from that plane,

09:18.792 --> 09:20.959
that could propel
this investigation forward.

09:21.061 --> 09:22.528
Let's go take a look.

09:26.467 --> 09:29.134
Don Tito leads the team
to the shore of the lagoon

09:29.236 --> 09:33.138
where the seaplane reportedly
landed over 70 years ago.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.174
So where was it?

09:35.276 --> 09:37.756
About 300 meters from here.

09:40.281 --> 09:41.647
300 meters out?

09:44.752 --> 09:48.520
We now have a specific
reference point to the search.

09:48.622 --> 09:52.024
Evidence could be waiting for us to
find on the bottom of that lagoon.

09:52.126 --> 09:57.196
This could be the launch point to finding
out if the seaplane did land on the lagoon

09:57.298 --> 10:02.167
and if this plane was truly
transporting high-level Nazis.

10:02.269 --> 10:03.671
If there's something there,
we'll be able to find it.

10:03.771 --> 10:06.872
Absolutely.

10:10.978 --> 10:12.978
This is secluded.
- Very.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.980
You don't get more rural than this.

10:15.082 --> 10:19.585
In Laguna de Rocha, Uruguay,
Tim Kennedy and Mike Simpson

10:19.687 --> 10:24.756
investigate a report claiming
that in 1945, a seaplane

10:24.858 --> 10:27.826
rumoured to have been carrying
high-ranking Nazis

10:27.928 --> 10:31.496
made an emergency landing
at a local lagoon.

10:31.599 --> 10:34.766
We need to find anything
that would definitively prove

10:34.868 --> 10:40.072
if this plane was here and if it's
truly transporting high-level Nazis

10:40.174 --> 10:42.774
from Europe to Buenos Aires.

10:42.876 --> 10:44.443
These might be our guys right here.

10:44.545 --> 10:50.015
In hopes of uncovering evidence that a
seaplane landed here over 70 years ago,

10:50.117 --> 10:53.418
Tim and Mike are joined by a
local marine surveying team...

10:53.520 --> 10:55.120
How you doing?

10:55.222 --> 10:57.289
To help them scan
the waters of the lagoon

10:57.391 --> 11:00.993
for any pieces of the plane
that may still remain.

11:01.095 --> 11:04.229
Let's get the equipment on the
boat and see what we can see.

11:04.331 --> 11:06.465
All right?

11:06.567 --> 11:09.635
Something could be preserved
in this lagoon very easily.

11:09.737 --> 11:11.005
You know, you don't
have lots of swell.

11:11.105 --> 11:12.471
You don't have
a lot of movement.

11:12.573 --> 11:14.339
There's very little tide shift.

11:14.441 --> 11:17.409
If something dropped off
70 years ago from this aircraft,

11:17.511 --> 11:20.045
there's a good chance we're
going to be able to find it.

11:20.147 --> 11:22.881
Tim, this is Mike.
Radio check.

11:22.983 --> 11:24.549
Mike, I got you, Lima Charlie.

11:24.652 --> 11:27.085
We are approaching
our target area.

11:27.187 --> 11:30.255
We're going to go ahead
and put the side-scan sonar

11:30.357 --> 11:33.091
into the water
and start our search.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.761
Although the water
is only four feet deep,

11:35.863 --> 11:38.163
a heavy silt layer
and poor visibility

11:38.265 --> 11:41.600
make it difficult
to locate any objects below,

11:41.702 --> 11:47.339
so the team will deploy side-scanning
sonar to penetrate to the lagoon floor.

11:47.441 --> 11:52.210
Using a grid-pattern search, they'll
investigate the 300-square-yard crash site

11:52.313 --> 11:55.280
identified by the eyewitness.

11:55.382 --> 11:58.717
One boat will survey with sonar
while the other drops buoys

11:58.819 --> 12:00.952
to mark any points of interest.

12:05.759 --> 12:09.494
Right now, we're in our target
area, and we are recording.

12:09.596 --> 12:11.196
GPS is running.

12:11.298 --> 12:13.801
If something is going to be down
there, we should be able to see it.

12:13.901 --> 12:15.167
I hope you're right.

12:16.637 --> 12:19.171
There's no telling what's
actually in the lagoon...

12:19.273 --> 12:23.375
You know, fishing nets, motors,
transmissions out of cars.

12:23.477 --> 12:25.877
That silt can cover
and disguise anything,

12:25.979 --> 12:28.280
so we have to be precise
in our movements,

12:28.382 --> 12:30.682
and we have to be methodical
in our search pattern.

12:30.784 --> 12:34.386
All right. We're going to be doing
our turn here in a couple minutes,

12:34.488 --> 12:36.555
finishing this line.

12:36.657 --> 12:39.991
And nothing on there.

12:43.564 --> 12:44.632
Hey, hey, hey,
right here, right here.

12:44.732 --> 12:47.132
We got something right here.

12:47.234 --> 12:53.305
About a foot in width and maybe
a foot and a half in length.

12:59.747 --> 13:02.314
Copy that, Tim. We'll go ahead
and mark it with a buoy.

13:02.416 --> 13:03.815
Standing by for countdown.

13:05.252 --> 13:09.121
Five, four, three, two...

13:13.360 --> 13:20.098
Located 275 yards offshore, the team
has identified a small man-made object

13:20.200 --> 13:21.900
on the lagoon floor.

13:24.338 --> 13:27.005
We're almost at the end
of the search line.

13:27.107 --> 13:28.107
All right.

13:28.208 --> 13:33.879
We got about another 50 to 100
meters of our search area.

13:33.981 --> 13:35.280
Copy that.

13:39.119 --> 13:41.622
Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Right
here, right here, right here.

13:41.722 --> 13:43.123
All right. Hey.
We got another target.

13:43.223 --> 13:45.457
Look at that.
That's a big one.

13:45.559 --> 13:49.694
This thing is a clear line.
Solid, flat line.

13:49.797 --> 13:53.465
It's about 5 or 6 feet
in length,

13:53.567 --> 13:56.968
and it's a solid return,
hard return coming back.

13:57.070 --> 14:00.639
That sonar is coming off
something dense, for sure.

14:00.741 --> 14:02.774
All right. 10 feet.
Get set. Here we go.

14:02.876 --> 14:07.813
Three, two, one.

14:07.915 --> 14:10.816
Drop, drop, drop.

14:10.918 --> 14:13.151
Buoy is in.

14:19.426 --> 14:21.226
These are more or less
in a straight line.

14:24.031 --> 14:28.133
This is where Don Tito said things are
going to be, and now we're finding stuff.

14:28.235 --> 14:31.336
The team has located
two areas of interest

14:31.438 --> 14:34.973
within 100 yards of each other,
positioned in a straight line

14:35.075 --> 14:38.076
following the general path
the seaplane reportedly took

14:38.178 --> 14:41.646
when it landed in this lagoon
over 70 years ago.

14:41.748 --> 14:45.617
All that's left to do now
that we've got them marked

14:45.719 --> 14:47.853
is get suited up
and get in the water.

14:47.955 --> 14:50.522
Let's head back to shore,
grab our wet suits,

14:50.624 --> 14:53.692
and then try to recover whatever
the buoys are sitting on top of.

14:53.794 --> 14:59.264
With two anomalies identified on the
floor of the shallow-water lagoon,

14:59.366 --> 15:03.602
the team will conduct a reconnaissance
of the target area on foot.

15:03.704 --> 15:08.306
We're hopeful that these are something
left over from this aircraft,

15:08.408 --> 15:13.712
something to give me a clue as to if
the seaplane did land on the lagoon

15:13.814 --> 15:16.047
and who was on board
and what it was carrying.

15:16.149 --> 15:17.349
We have our targets.

15:17.451 --> 15:20.819
Now we just need to go see
what's underneath those buoys.

15:20.921 --> 15:22.389
All right.
Got the first buoy right there.

15:22.489 --> 15:24.489
Perfect.

15:24.591 --> 15:27.058
I'm getting in.

15:27.160 --> 15:29.327
So stay kind of, like,
feet distance apart.

15:29.429 --> 15:30.896
Yeah. Sounds good.

15:30.998 --> 15:35.066
Let's try not to get cut
on anything either, though.

15:35.168 --> 15:36.701
You have anything over there?

15:36.803 --> 15:38.136
Nothing.

15:41.775 --> 15:43.875
Something just moved
in my fingers.

15:43.977 --> 15:45.577
That...
Whoa, that's big.

15:45.679 --> 15:47.879
Yeah.

15:47.981 --> 15:50.382
It's coming
all the way out to here.

15:50.484 --> 15:52.584
A little bit stuck.
- Yeah.

15:52.686 --> 15:54.019
I got it.
I got it.

15:54.121 --> 15:57.389
One, two, three.
Three.

15:57.491 --> 15:59.891
Holy That... The
hell is this thing?

15:59.993 --> 16:02.193
Looks like it's been
down there a while?

16:02.296 --> 16:04.229
It's busted up for sure.

16:04.331 --> 16:05.564
Yeah, it is.

16:05.666 --> 16:07.067
This looks like where
it was torn off...

16:07.167 --> 16:08.867
Yeah.
- right here on this end.

16:08.969 --> 16:11.036
This looks like
it's an engine part.

16:11.138 --> 16:12.537
This is coming off
something big.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.773
That is not from a boat motor.
Yeah.

16:14.875 --> 16:17.842
This has no business
being out here. No.

16:17.945 --> 16:19.578
We found something
in our target area.

16:19.680 --> 16:24.249
Clearly, it's a part of a motor, but I
don't know if this is part of our aircraft.

16:24.351 --> 16:26.284
We have to keep looking.

16:26.386 --> 16:30.355
With anomaly one identified
as a potential engine part,

16:30.457 --> 16:34.559
Mike and Tim walk 100 yards
to the area of anomaly two.

16:34.661 --> 16:38.430
Last marker.
This was the biggest echo.

16:38.532 --> 16:40.231
All right.

16:46.807 --> 16:48.273
Aah!

16:48.375 --> 16:49.641
What do you got?

16:49.743 --> 16:51.610
There's, like,
a sharp edge right here.

16:51.712 --> 16:54.779
Something here.

16:54.881 --> 16:56.081
How big is this?

16:56.183 --> 16:57.782
Tim, this is big,
whatever it is.

16:57.884 --> 17:00.251
Loosen it?
- No, I can't move mine.

17:00.354 --> 17:01.319
All right.
It's moving now.

17:01.421 --> 17:02.621
Back and forth?
- Yeah.

17:02.723 --> 17:03.991
This is metal.
- Yeah, go left and right.

17:04.090 --> 17:05.323
Go left and right.

17:05.425 --> 17:06.758
It's way in the muck.

17:06.859 --> 17:08.827
Let me get my
feet up under me.

17:08.929 --> 17:10.228
Ready?

17:13.400 --> 17:18.670
Holyshit. Is this aluminium?

17:18.771 --> 17:20.505
Yep.
- Look at the damage.

17:20.607 --> 17:22.440
It just sheared at the end here.

17:22.541 --> 17:23.808
This is an airplane propeller.

17:23.910 --> 17:25.276
100 percent.

17:25.378 --> 17:27.112
Mike, we got it.

17:27.214 --> 17:29.347
This is exactly what we're looking for.
Yeah.

17:29.449 --> 17:31.516
I mean, this is exactly
where Don Tito

17:31.618 --> 17:33.918
said the airplane landed.

17:34.021 --> 17:35.520
You want corroborating evidence?

17:35.622 --> 17:37.422
This is it right here.
Yeah.

17:37.524 --> 17:41.526
Is there any other reason that this
propeller would be out in this lagoon?

17:41.628 --> 17:43.094
None whatsoever.

17:43.196 --> 17:46.197
It's in the lie of where we know
the aircraft came in.

17:46.299 --> 17:48.433
It's an aircraft propeller.

17:48.535 --> 17:51.002
Certainly has been
down there a long time.

17:51.104 --> 17:55.840
We have now found physical evidence
that there was a plane here,

17:55.942 --> 17:59.310
but that doesn't tell us what
that plane was doing here.

17:59.413 --> 18:05.316
We still have to get more information to be
able to know if there were Nazis on board.

18:10.490 --> 18:13.024
Who could possibly
be on this airplane?

18:13.126 --> 18:16.528
This thing is huge, enormous.

18:16.630 --> 18:19.364
Bob and Nada review the
findings from the field team

18:19.466 --> 18:23.468
235 miles outside
of Buenos Aires, Argentina,

18:23.570 --> 18:28.606
where they have uncovered physical evidence
of a 1945 emergency seaplane landing

18:28.709 --> 18:34.112
that, according to a Uruguayan report, was
transporting Nazi war criminals and gold.

18:34.214 --> 18:37.082
The team scanned the area,
and they found two items.

18:37.184 --> 18:40.418
One was possibly an engine part,
and the other one is a propeller,

18:40.520 --> 18:42.487
and it's a fairly large
propeller.

18:42.589 --> 18:44.389
It's not off a small plane.

18:44.491 --> 18:47.492
We at least have some evidence
to place the seaplane there.

18:47.594 --> 18:49.828
Now the question becomes
how do we confirm

18:49.930 --> 18:53.231
that the passengers on board
were actually Nazi officers?

18:53.333 --> 18:56.601
Our eyewitness, Don Tito,
told us that the seaplane

18:56.703 --> 18:59.604
had three other planes
accompanying it.

18:59.706 --> 19:02.941
He talked about at least one of
the passengers having bodyguards.

19:03.043 --> 19:08.680
Who takes bodyguards with him in a plane
travelling through South America?

19:08.782 --> 19:12.283
None of this makes
any sense at all.

19:12.385 --> 19:14.185
If what the eyewitness
said is true,

19:14.287 --> 19:17.122
this does not sound like
a typical commercial flight.

19:17.224 --> 19:18.992
We don't know for sure
what those other planes were.

19:19.092 --> 19:21.793
Were they there
for deterrent or defense?

19:21.895 --> 19:25.130
We need to see how many more
pieces we can add to the puzzle.

19:25.232 --> 19:27.532
We know this plane
could have landed there.

19:27.634 --> 19:30.969
It begs the question,
who was on it?

19:31.071 --> 19:34.405
We have to separate the myth
from the fact here.

19:46.052 --> 19:48.386
We're coming up to the main
point in Montevideo.

19:48.488 --> 19:54.025
Tim and Mike land
125 miles east of Buenos Aires

19:54.127 --> 19:59.264
where their local contact, Dante, has
arranged a meeting with Jose Aldunate,

19:59.366 --> 20:02.433
a man whose father
was one of the first people

20:02.536 --> 20:05.436
to respond to the
seaplane crash in 1945.

20:07.874 --> 20:11.376
Now we know that plane made the
emergency landing in Laguna de Rocha.

20:11.478 --> 20:14.879
What we don't know is what this
flight was and who was on it.

20:14.981 --> 20:17.549
Thanks for taking the time
to talk to us.

20:17.651 --> 20:21.119
Your father was present
during the evacuation?

20:22.689 --> 20:26.424
When they evacuated everybody off
the plane, what did that look like?

20:26.526 --> 20:28.960
Can you describe to me
what the people look like?

20:29.062 --> 20:30.328
Did they take all the cargo?

20:30.430 --> 20:32.831
Did they take everything
that was in the plane?

20:40.340 --> 20:42.774
They took everything
from the plane.

20:42.876 --> 20:44.342
Right away?
- Right away.

20:52.786 --> 20:54.986
The commander,
the pilot of the seaplane,

20:55.088 --> 20:57.989
and his father,
they became close friends.

20:58.091 --> 21:01.759
They spent about two days
together fixing the plane

21:01.862 --> 21:05.163
and speaking about
previous flights.

21:05.265 --> 21:07.265
Do you think that the
commander of the seaplane

21:07.367 --> 21:12.437
was working directly for the Germans
after the war and flying Nazis?

21:29.890 --> 21:31.970
What was the present
that the pilot gave your father?

21:36.496 --> 21:37.896
You have it?

21:39.900 --> 21:43.401
You have the thing that
the pilot gave to your father?

21:43.503 --> 21:46.738
I want to see it, please.

21:49.075 --> 21:53.244
Everything that Mr. Aldunate
tells us is very interesting,

21:53.346 --> 21:55.713
but at this point,
it's all just conjecture.

21:55.815 --> 21:57.181
It's all speculation.

21:57.284 --> 22:02.186
We need some physical proof to
link Nazis with this aircraft.

22:06.359 --> 22:07.825
What is this?

22:10.897 --> 22:14.432
It's in German.
Schwimmweste.

22:17.203 --> 22:19.938
My God.
Is that what I think it is?

22:22.275 --> 22:23.942
This is a swastika.

22:27.681 --> 22:30.281
The life vest from the pilot
was German-made,

22:30.383 --> 22:34.185
German-manufactured,
has a swastika on it.

22:34.287 --> 22:39.023
This can prove that there
were Nazis on board that flight.

22:39.125 --> 22:44.562
Did your father ever speculate as to
what he thought this pilot was doing?

22:51.972 --> 22:55.640
He says that this pilot
flew through South America

22:55.742 --> 22:58.042
where there was
some Nazi communities.

23:00.513 --> 23:03.648
And he would land at
the ParanÃ¡ River in Misiones?

23:03.750 --> 23:06.584
Yes, ParanÃ¡ River.

23:06.686 --> 23:10.221
We know that the Nazis
were in Misiones.

23:10.323 --> 23:14.225
This feels
like military barracks.

23:14.327 --> 23:15.662
You could shoot
straight across this.

23:15.762 --> 23:19.464
This is going to give you an
elevated position to rain down hell.

23:19.566 --> 23:22.734
Another layer of protection
for who is behind it.

23:24.671 --> 23:27.605
He also mentioned
the Atlantic Coast of Argentina

23:27.707 --> 23:29.474
in Santa Cruz and Buenos Aires,

23:29.576 --> 23:32.844
and he mentioned the final
destination, which is Patagonia.

23:32.946 --> 23:35.146
Do you know what specific
lakes in Patagonia?

23:36.649 --> 23:39.417
That's the lake next to Bariloche.
- Yes.

23:43.189 --> 23:46.290
So he would fly, and he would
land in the ParanÃ¡ River,

23:46.393 --> 23:48.426
and he would land in Bariloche

23:48.528 --> 23:53.598
where we know there are a dense
population of high-ranking Nazis.

23:53.700 --> 23:56.834
Hundreds of Nazis came here
at the end of World War II.

23:56.936 --> 23:58.302
This is a refuge.

24:04.878 --> 24:07.979
We're talking a mansion
40 miles away from anywhere.

24:09.749 --> 24:11.618
Hey, I've found what I think
is a ramp for seaplanes

24:11.718 --> 24:14.018
coming right up to the front
of this property.

24:16.990 --> 24:19.657
This is massively significant,
that this plane could fly

24:19.759 --> 24:23.961
all the way from Europe to here
and then go to Bariloche.

24:24.064 --> 24:26.964
This seaplane and this pilot
were making landings

24:27.067 --> 24:30.201
all throughout South America...
Places that we've been before.

24:30.303 --> 24:31.736
This is not a coincidence.

24:31.838 --> 24:35.473
This was part
of a Nazi shuttle service.

24:41.181 --> 24:42.647
We look at the evidence,

24:42.749 --> 24:45.917
and no individual piece
tells a whole story,

24:46.019 --> 24:49.220
but when you start
stacking them up, they do.

24:49.322 --> 24:52.924
Bob and Nada review the
findings from South America

24:53.026 --> 24:57.061
where the team has uncovered evidence
that a seaplane was shuttling Nazis

24:57.163 --> 25:00.865
from Buenos Aires
to key outposts in Bariloche

25:00.967 --> 25:03.601
and the ParanÃ¡ River
near Misiones.

25:03.703 --> 25:07.505
So the eyewitness tells us
that the seaplane lands.

25:07.607 --> 25:09.740
His father actually
helps repair the plane,

25:09.843 --> 25:13.411
talks to the captain,
who's pilot of the plane,

25:13.513 --> 25:17.281
who tells him this plane went to
some of these other designated areas

25:17.383 --> 25:18.749
that you've already looked at.

25:18.852 --> 25:20.952
Yeah.
All the key areas...

25:21.054 --> 25:26.757
Bariloche, Misiones, and Buenos Aires,
to me, this looks like Nazi Air.

25:26.860 --> 25:28.559
It was like
a Nazi charter flight.

25:28.661 --> 25:32.463
This is a legitimate way for Nazis to
be able to travel within South America.

25:32.565 --> 25:33.731
Yeah.

25:33.833 --> 25:37.902
We are starting to connect
these Nazi facilities

25:38.004 --> 25:41.572
with a way to transport
people back and forth.

25:41.674 --> 25:48.079
I think we found the transportation system
the Nazis used to get around South America,

25:48.181 --> 25:52.550
and that's a seaplane leaving from
Buenos Aires into the interior.

25:52.652 --> 25:56.254
You need connections between
the various German areas,

25:56.356 --> 25:59.323
and this seaplane
would give you that.

25:59.425 --> 26:01.659
When we started
this investigation,

26:01.761 --> 26:06.430
it was Nazis made it to some
remote area and hid out.

26:06.533 --> 26:09.767
But now we've got airplanes that
are going around South America.

26:09.869 --> 26:12.236
The evidence is stacking up.

26:12.338 --> 26:15.907
Everything we've seen...
Communications, transportation,

26:16.009 --> 26:23.414
facilities, gold, they actually have the
makings of a Nazi state in South America.

26:23.516 --> 26:26.017
The Nazis
really did have a plan.

26:26.119 --> 26:28.186
They were going to flee Europe,

26:28.288 --> 26:32.690
and they were going to start
the Fourth Reich in Argentina.

26:32.792 --> 26:35.193
The question is,
where was the capital?

26:35.295 --> 26:36.594
We know it wasn't Misiones.

26:36.696 --> 26:37.828
It's too remote.

26:37.931 --> 26:40.264
Was it Buenos Aires?

26:40.366 --> 26:42.300
We got to get the team
to find out.

26:52.111 --> 26:55.313
There are still people out there
that do not want this story told,

26:55.415 --> 27:00.484
so anything that can actually firm up
this end of the story would be brilliant.

27:00.587 --> 27:04.622
Tim Kennedy, Gerrard Williams
and their local contact, Dante,

27:04.724 --> 27:08.893
are in Buenos Aires, Argentina,
following a new lead that could change

27:08.995 --> 27:11.295
the course
of their investigation.

27:11.397 --> 27:14.398
In Argentina, they do not talk
about the Nazis.

27:14.500 --> 27:16.067
There's a wall of silence.

27:16.169 --> 27:20.338
70-something years on after the end
of World War II, it's still here.

27:20.440 --> 27:21.841
If we're going to break
through that wall,

27:21.941 --> 27:24.675
it has to be handled
very, very sensitively.

27:24.777 --> 27:31.015
The team has secured an exclusive meeting
with investigative journalist HÃ©ctor Amudo,

27:31.117 --> 27:34.885
who has spent his career infiltrating
Nazi networks in South America.

27:34.988 --> 27:36.721
HÃ©ctor Amudo.
Nice to meet you.

27:36.823 --> 27:41.158
He is rumoured to have access to a
collection of never-before-seen documents

27:41.261 --> 27:43.995
outlining the Nazis' escape
through Buenos Aires.

27:44.097 --> 27:51.769
We were told that you have information
about the movement of Nazis in Argentina,

27:51.871 --> 27:53.437
specifically in Buenos Aires.

28:10.723 --> 28:13.891
Did you ever get to meet
this informant in person?

28:16.629 --> 28:20.097
Day after that,
he received an e-mail

28:20.199 --> 28:23.367
with some documents
related to the right links.

28:30.410 --> 28:32.543
5,000 documents?

28:32.645 --> 28:38.282
There were migration documents,
and he believes they don't exist

28:38.384 --> 28:40.117
anywhere in the world nowadays.

28:42.822 --> 28:46.157
So there are no public archive
versions of this or anything?

28:46.259 --> 28:47.591
No. No.

28:47.694 --> 28:50.895
These documents may be key
to discovering

28:50.997 --> 28:54.665
how the Nazis actually
operated in Argentina.

28:54.767 --> 29:00.971
It's vitally important that we get to
the real source of this information.

29:01.074 --> 29:03.341
That means seeing
the documents for ourselves

29:03.443 --> 29:05.776
and talking to the man
who has them.

29:05.878 --> 29:07.011
What's this man's name?

29:11.117 --> 29:14.285
It's paramount that we talk
to him, your informant.

29:17.223 --> 29:20.791
He says he's going to call
and try to convince him.

29:22.128 --> 29:23.661
If we want to see
these documents,

29:23.763 --> 29:25.696
if we want to go and talk
to this informant,

29:25.798 --> 29:27.998
HÃ©ctor is our chance.

29:32.071 --> 29:33.071
How dit go?

29:40.279 --> 29:42.213
Great.
- Well-done.

29:42.315 --> 29:43.848
There's some conditions,
you know.

29:49.355 --> 29:51.589
There's no showing of his face.
- Right.

29:54.160 --> 29:56.494
We agree to those conditions.
- Yes.

29:56.596 --> 29:59.263
You know, just tell us
when and where to meet him.

29:59.365 --> 30:01.932
This level of effort
to remain anonymous

30:02.034 --> 30:04.402
means that he could have
ground-breaking evidence

30:04.504 --> 30:06.937
and information
about this investigation.

30:07.039 --> 30:09.907
There's no telling
what this informant has,

30:10.009 --> 30:13.677
but this could break
this investigation wide open.

30:20.420 --> 30:21.685
We have one more turn.

30:21.788 --> 30:22.987
Okay.

30:23.089 --> 30:27.458
In Buenos Aires, Argentina,
Tim and Gerrard's local contact

30:27.560 --> 30:30.661
has arranged for the team
to meet with an informant

30:30.763 --> 30:34.732
who claims to have in his possession
a large quantity of documents

30:34.834 --> 30:38.335
regarding the movement of escaped
Nazis through Buenos Aires.

30:38.438 --> 30:41.505
He sounds really nervous, so we're
just going to have to make sure

30:41.607 --> 30:43.207
that, even though
the cameras are there,

30:43.309 --> 30:45.342
that the cameras feel
like they're not there,

30:45.445 --> 30:50.514
and if he focuses in on it and gets
really shy, then we have a problem.

30:50.616 --> 30:55.719
There's no telling how important or
significant this interview could become.

30:55.822 --> 31:00.090
This might give us actual documentation
of what happened to Adolf Hitler

31:00.193 --> 31:02.526
and other high-ranking Nazis.

31:02.628 --> 31:04.895
Let's do it.

31:04.997 --> 31:07.398
Just keep the camera down.

31:09.702 --> 31:11.569
This is it?

31:14.373 --> 31:15.573
How you doing?
- Hi.

31:15.675 --> 31:17.208
Tim.

31:17.310 --> 31:19.777
Due to the sensitive
nature of his documents,

31:19.879 --> 31:21.912
the informant has requested
that the team

31:22.014 --> 31:24.114
keep his identity a secret.

31:24.217 --> 31:27.685
Really appreciate you taking
the time to talk to us.

31:27.787 --> 31:30.855
We're not going to use anything

31:30.957 --> 31:34.959
that will put you
or your family in jeopardy.

31:35.061 --> 31:36.129
We can disguise your voice.

31:36.229 --> 31:37.795
We can blur your face.

31:37.897 --> 31:39.964
We just want to see
the information.

31:40.066 --> 31:42.366
We understand
that you have documents

31:42.468 --> 31:46.470
that detail the movement
of Nazis in Argentina postwar.

31:52.912 --> 31:54.545
That's correct.

31:54.647 --> 31:58.682
Could you tell us where
you got these documents from,

31:58.784 --> 32:02.620
how you came to get your
hands on this information?

32:08.060 --> 32:10.961
He's a senior party member,
your granddad?

32:15.835 --> 32:20.437
There's an organization that
was founded by major Nazis.

32:20.540 --> 32:24.842
His grandfather, being part of this
community, received these documents.

32:24.944 --> 32:30.281
Then when his grandfather passed
away, he found files, documents.

32:30.383 --> 32:31.916
Was there a name for that group?

32:33.753 --> 32:36.487
Die Spinne was operating
in Argentina?

32:44.096 --> 32:46.864
We have investigated
Die Spinne before.

32:46.966 --> 32:52.870
On the 10th of August, 1944,
many wealthy German expats

32:52.972 --> 32:56.941
as well as many Nazi officials, under
the supervision of Martin Bormann,

32:57.043 --> 32:59.643
met to plan the formation of...

33:01.380 --> 33:04.815
This was a network that could,
with great numbers and ease,

33:04.917 --> 33:08.385
transfer the highest-level Nazis
out of Europe.

33:08.487 --> 33:11.021
His grandfather
was at the center of Die Spinne.

33:11.123 --> 33:14.558
He helped and facilitated the
movement of high-ranking Nazis,

33:14.660 --> 33:17.461
maybe even Adolf Hitler
himself, into Argentina.

33:21.067 --> 33:23.300
Do you want to see
the accountant's book?

33:23.402 --> 33:25.436
Yeah.

33:37.917 --> 33:39.817
The numbers, is that money?

33:42.521 --> 33:47.324
This is $288,000.

33:47.426 --> 33:50.060
Somebody is moving over
a quarter of a million dollars.

33:50.162 --> 33:52.529
Dollars?
- Dollars.

33:52.632 --> 33:55.165
These are massive sums of money.

33:55.267 --> 33:59.737
This is them counting every single
dollar of them moving people from Europe

33:59.839 --> 34:01.672
to Argentina and South America.

34:01.774 --> 34:03.440
Somebody was funding it.

34:03.542 --> 34:08.078
Somebody is financing it to a
huge level, so much money.

34:08.179 --> 34:10.681
What we have in our hands
is a ledger

34:10.783 --> 34:15.052
which details transactions
that pay for the ships

34:15.154 --> 34:17.454
that are bringing the Nazis
across the Atlantic

34:17.556 --> 34:19.255
to their new home
in Buenos Aires.

34:19.358 --> 34:23.460
Do you have any other
documents of specific individuals

34:23.562 --> 34:26.630
about their movement, how
they came here, immigration?

34:30.569 --> 34:31.768
Said we should go upstairs.

34:31.871 --> 34:34.271
Can we see them?

34:47.286 --> 34:50.888
These are all related
to the immigration?

34:56.929 --> 35:01.832
So every one of these is an
individual document of immigration.

35:01.934 --> 35:05.969
This is a massive amount of
information and a ton of documents.

35:06.072 --> 35:08.672
In the hopes of finally
setting history straight,

35:08.774 --> 35:12.342
the informant has granted the team
exclusive permission to review,

35:12.445 --> 35:15.846
for the very first time, his
cache of hundreds of documents

35:15.948 --> 35:19.650
that have been kept under lock
and key for nearly 70 years.

35:19.752 --> 35:22.119
What this informant
was showing us is amazing...

35:22.221 --> 35:27.658
Stack after stack of immigration documents,
and if Adolf Eichmann, Martin Bormann,

35:27.760 --> 35:31.795
or even Adolf Hitler is in
there, that changes history.

35:31.897 --> 35:34.465
This is a treasure trove
of information.

35:34.567 --> 35:37.935
This is the Atlantis of
how Nazis are being moved.

35:46.645 --> 35:50.848
So every one of these is an
individual document of immigration.

35:50.950 --> 35:54.885
In Buenos Aires, Tim and
Gerrard prepare to inspect

35:54.987 --> 35:58.388
a private collection of secret,
never-before-seen documents

35:58.491 --> 36:01.391
that could shed new light
on Nazi war criminals

36:01.494 --> 36:05.562
moving into Argentina
after World War II.

36:05.664 --> 36:10.334
These are proof of these Nazis
coming into the country.

36:10.436 --> 36:12.369
Yeah.

36:12.471 --> 36:18.575
The potential of what these documents
may contain could rewrite history.

36:18.677 --> 36:23.981
This could be hard evidence on paper
of Nazis entering Buenos Aires.

36:24.083 --> 36:29.853
Whatever information we gather, it could
lead us directly to Adolf Hitler himself.

36:29.955 --> 36:33.257
These are amazing.

36:33.359 --> 36:35.993
I've not seen documents
like this before.

36:36.095 --> 36:39.196
I would like to call a friend
in the archives in Buenos Aires

36:39.298 --> 36:42.099
and see if she can come
and just take a look at these

36:42.201 --> 36:43.934
and tell us they're real.

36:44.036 --> 36:45.002
No problem.
- Brilliant.

36:45.104 --> 36:46.436
Okay.

36:46.539 --> 36:49.439
It is imperative when you
come across information,

36:49.542 --> 36:54.678
documentation that is this significant to
history, that it has to be authenticated.

36:54.780 --> 36:56.213
You know, it has to be vetted.

36:56.315 --> 36:59.349
It has to be shown
to be truthful and accurate.

37:01.821 --> 37:03.453
Lucrecia, thank you very much.

37:03.556 --> 37:05.856
Good to see you.
And you.

37:05.958 --> 37:12.062
Tim and Gerrard enlist the help of Lucrecia
Kessig, document verification expert

37:12.164 --> 37:15.866
from the Argentine National
Archives, whose extensive knowledge

37:15.968 --> 37:19.369
will help the team
authenticate the documents.

37:19.471 --> 37:21.405
So, these are our documents.

37:21.507 --> 37:23.073
Okay.

37:23.175 --> 37:26.210
Lucrecia from the National Archive
has been helpful before,

37:26.312 --> 37:28.545
especially in some of
my research in Buenos Aires.

37:28.647 --> 37:31.548
She knows her stuff,
so she'll be able to tell us

37:31.650 --> 37:34.818
whether this mound  of
documentation that we have before us

37:34.920 --> 37:37.287
is real and is from the period.

37:37.389 --> 37:39.823
We're going to get
a professional in to tell us.

38:02.581 --> 38:03.680
Okay.

38:19.698 --> 38:21.378
So in your professional
opinion...

38:24.870 --> 38:26.103
Thank you.

38:26.205 --> 38:28.205
What Gerrard and I
have to do now

38:28.307 --> 38:32.276
is go through every single
one of these documents.

38:32.378 --> 38:35.679
We're trying to find
high-ranking Nazis.

38:35.781 --> 38:37.881
We can't miss a single detail.

38:51.997 --> 38:53.397
How many boxes?

38:53.499 --> 38:56.800
We're getting through them.

38:56.902 --> 39:02.739
So 1945, 300,000 people
came to Argentina.

39:02.841 --> 39:07.311
In 1946, 351,000
came to Argentina.

39:07.413 --> 39:10.247
That's a lot of people moving
in and out of the country.

39:10.349 --> 39:11.517
How many of them are Nazis, Tim?

39:11.617 --> 39:13.483
How many of them were fascists?

39:13.585 --> 39:15.886
How many of them were the
worst creatures on the planet?

39:19.291 --> 39:20.857
Some more...

39:20.960 --> 39:22.194
More immigration?
- Disembark. Yeah.

39:22.294 --> 39:23.660
Yeah.
- Immigration disembarks.

39:23.762 --> 39:25.162
Recognize any of these people?

39:29.368 --> 39:32.269
The ship manifest, Tim.
Passenger numbers?

39:32.371 --> 39:34.404
Yeah.

39:34.506 --> 39:39.343
And number 920 sticks out
like a sore thumb.

39:41.180 --> 39:45.849
Last name on the list,
typed in black.

39:45.951 --> 39:51.355
Gregor Helmut, Gregor Helmut,
NN, Gregor Helmut.

39:51.457 --> 39:54.725
Helmut Gregor, Tim,
is Josef Mengele.

39:56.795 --> 40:00.130
And Josef Mengele is one
of the most foul creatures

40:00.232 --> 40:03.867
the world has ever produced,
the camp doctor at Auschwitz,

40:03.969 --> 40:06.903
Auschwitz's Angel of Death.

40:07.006 --> 40:09.272
This is his alias?
This is Josef Mengele's alias?

40:09.375 --> 40:13.210
One of the many he uses,
but it's the first one he uses.

40:13.312 --> 40:14.778
It looks like
it's been added on.

40:14.880 --> 40:16.813
Maybe he's late
to join the ship.

40:16.915 --> 40:19.449
Holyshit.

40:19.551 --> 40:23.487
We know how Helmut Gregor
is actually Josef Mengele,

40:23.589 --> 40:25.922
one of the worst criminals
in the Holocaust,

40:26.025 --> 40:29.726
very, very senior
in that Nazi network

40:29.828 --> 40:34.631
and a man who is being not
just given refuge in Argentina,

40:34.733 --> 40:37.501
but being welcomed here.

40:37.603 --> 40:42.005
We know, after World War II,
Josef Mengele was never caught.

40:42.107 --> 40:46.777
Following Mengele could lead us
directly to Adolf Hitler himself.

40:50.516 --> 40:52.983
Next time
on "Hunting Hitler"...

40:53.085 --> 40:54.451
Look at that light bulb.

40:56.255 --> 40:58.422
It is a swastika.
It's a beacon.

40:58.524 --> 41:02.526
We now have a hydroelectric
power plant here in Uruguay

41:02.628 --> 41:04.661
that could have been
producing heavy water,

41:04.763 --> 41:09.199
one of the most important components
to a nuclear weapon from the Nazis.

41:18.544 --> 41:20.024
The house that you
saw Adolf Hitler...

41:26.919 --> 41:28.718
Look at this fence.

41:28.821 --> 41:32.689
Why do you need that out here?

41:32.791 --> 41:36.059
This could be a perfect spot for an ambush,
a couple of guys with machine guns.

41:36.161 --> 41:37.494
Nobody is getting through.

41:39.832 --> 41:42.065
This might be a guard shack.

41:42.167 --> 41:46.369
From this one position alone, you
could almost walk down this valley.

41:46.472 --> 41:50.173
This is where Adolf Hitler
could stay safe and secure

41:50.275 --> 41:54.111
and live out his old age, move his
plans forward for the Fourth Reich.
