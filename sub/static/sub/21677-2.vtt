WEBVTT

00:12.500 --> 00:13.042
Previously on "Below Deck"...

00:14.208 --> 00:15.208
- Hey, kiddo.
- Hi!

00:15.250 --> 00:16.875
- Hey, Captain.
How you doing?

00:16.917 --> 00:18.167
- We got a pretty good crew
for you.

00:18.208 --> 00:19.333
You've got a senior deckhand.

00:19.375 --> 00:20.958
- Kate?
Trevor, senior deckhand.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.375
- I'm Emily.
- Trevor. I'm senior deckhand.

00:23.417 --> 00:24.708
- Hey, I'm Trevor.
I'm senior deckhand.

00:24.708 --> 00:26.875
- Are you dating anyone?
- I actually am.

00:26.917 --> 00:28.542
She had just come back
to the town.

00:28.542 --> 00:29.917
- Oh, it's a she.
- Yeah.

00:31.542 --> 00:33.542
- I think it's wild.

00:33.583 --> 00:35.458
- Is this our stew?

00:35.500 --> 00:37.625
- I don't know what happened.
I missed my plane.

00:39.417 --> 00:41.375
- We have our primary,
Alison.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.333
- Hi!

00:43.375 --> 00:45.625
- She's Instagram friends
with all of the other girls,

00:45.667 --> 00:47.125
but they've never, ever met.

00:47.167 --> 00:48.167
- Hey.
- Kelley.

00:48.208 --> 00:49.417
- Kelsey.
Nice to meet you.

00:49.458 --> 00:50.708
- It's been five months
of no sex.

00:50.750 --> 00:53.042
Ooh, I'm in trouble.

00:53.083 --> 00:55.750
- Just make sure, when you're
done with any hose, drain it.

00:55.750 --> 00:58.250
So, yeah, these windows
and then flats.

00:58.292 --> 01:00.167
Just scrub this deck.
- All right.

01:00.208 --> 01:02.750
Trevor telling us to do, like,
every little thing.

01:02.750 --> 01:04.750
Don't treat me
like I'm a green deckhand.

01:04.750 --> 01:06.708
- Hey, Trevor!

01:06.750 --> 01:08.583
- Got to be smarter
than that.

01:26.042 --> 01:27.333
- Hey, Kelley.

01:27.375 --> 01:29.250
- The other two deckhands
are having

01:29.292 --> 01:31.208
a little issue with Trevor.

01:31.250 --> 01:35.292
- He's your responsibility now,
and just say, "Listen...

01:35.333 --> 01:37.542
"if you think
you're indispensable,

01:37.583 --> 01:38.625
you're not."

01:38.667 --> 01:40.750
Nobody is.

01:40.792 --> 01:42.583
- Okay.
Thanks, Captain.

01:42.625 --> 01:43.792
- Thank you.

01:46.625 --> 01:49.542
- I'm here to make a great first
impression on Captain Lee.

01:49.583 --> 01:51.125
He said, "Figure it out."

01:51.167 --> 01:53.125
I'm trying to,
but I'm trying to also dip into

01:53.167 --> 01:55.125
the pool of experience
that you have,

01:55.167 --> 01:58.583
and this problem this early on
is terrifying.

01:58.625 --> 02:00.458
Trevor, Trevor, this is Kelley.

02:00.458 --> 02:01.625
- Put some vinegar
in this water here.

02:01.667 --> 02:03.083
- Yeah, there's some
in there.

02:03.125 --> 02:04.750
- Go ahead, Kelley.
- Where you at?

02:04.792 --> 02:06.625
- Meet you at the forward beam.
- Roger that.

02:10.292 --> 02:11.500
- Actually, I don't know
how to AirDrop.

02:11.500 --> 02:13.000
- Kate, what's our itinerary?

02:13.042 --> 02:14.292
- We're gonna have
a beach picnic.

02:14.333 --> 02:16.500
- Are you looking for some?

02:16.542 --> 02:18.917
- Yeah.
- You want to send it to me?

02:18.958 --> 02:20.667
- I probably do.
I love you.

02:20.667 --> 02:22.625
- I wish all guests were
this social media-obsessed.

02:22.667 --> 02:24.292
I could just lay in my bunk,

02:24.333 --> 02:27.125
Tweeting them dinner times
and menu options.

02:27.167 --> 02:30.000
- Oh, your body is--
I mean, they're all insane.

02:30.042 --> 02:31.500
- Your body.
- Your body!

02:31.542 --> 02:33.125
- How's it going?

02:33.167 --> 02:35.125
- Come to our stool.

02:37.333 --> 02:40.125
I'm very appreciative
that I have you here.

02:40.167 --> 02:41.792
I'm glad that you have
leadership experience,

02:41.833 --> 02:43.583
and, yes,
you're the senior deckhand.

02:43.625 --> 02:46.333
But I have Nico and Lauren
getting frustrated

02:46.333 --> 02:48.333
because sometimes
you kind of bark orders

02:48.333 --> 02:50.750
to the other two.

02:50.792 --> 02:52.333
- Um...

02:52.333 --> 02:53.708
- Day one, I was like,
"All right.

02:53.708 --> 02:55.333
he doesn't really know
our experience."

02:55.375 --> 02:56.792
- Yeah.
He does, though.

02:56.833 --> 02:58.667
We both talked about it
together, about--

02:58.708 --> 03:00.125
- Yeah, if it's gonna be
every day...

03:00.167 --> 03:01.458
- Every day.

03:01.500 --> 03:03.000
- Seeing everybody's rÃ©sumÃ©,
I know

03:03.042 --> 03:04.500
everybody knows
what the hell they're doing,

03:04.542 --> 03:05.542
and I've seen it in action.

03:05.583 --> 03:07.542
- I feel undermined.

03:07.542 --> 03:09.542
If Nico and Lauren
have a problem with me,

03:09.542 --> 03:12.208
they need to come
discuss it with me firsthand,

03:12.208 --> 03:13.542
not go talk behind my back.

03:13.542 --> 03:15.542
Everybody can get
a little snappy sometimes.

03:15.583 --> 03:17.208
I happen to sometimes too.

03:17.208 --> 03:18.542
- I understand, man.

03:18.583 --> 03:20.375
- Are you finished?
- Yeah, go ahead.

03:20.417 --> 03:22.583
Yep.

03:26.208 --> 03:27.542
- Have you done beach parties
before?

03:27.583 --> 03:29.458
- No.
- So get excited.

03:29.500 --> 03:32.042
I'm gonna go over and show you
how everything's set up.

03:32.083 --> 03:34.833
I'll pack the coolers
with Pinot Grigio, champagne,

03:34.875 --> 03:37.500
diet Coke, sparking water.

03:37.542 --> 03:38.833
- Okay,
so we're just serving.

03:38.875 --> 03:40.167
- Yeah.
- Oh, that's awesome.

03:40.208 --> 03:41.208
- Super easy.

03:41.250 --> 03:42.708
- I love getting off the boat

03:42.750 --> 03:44.208
and being on the beach,
even if I'm working.

03:44.250 --> 03:46.500
- It's just like serving
on the boat.

03:46.542 --> 03:49.208
- But it's windy, sandy...

03:49.250 --> 03:51.875
- I used to love
beach picnics...

03:51.917 --> 03:54.333
until I became a chief stew.

03:54.375 --> 03:57.167
So if there's one service
where I'm not gonna be present,

03:57.208 --> 03:58.375
it's gonna be that one.

03:58.417 --> 03:59.917
And so get excited.

04:01.583 --> 04:03.542
- F---ing undermine me.

04:03.583 --> 04:05.750
- Whoo!

04:05.792 --> 04:08.833
- Hey, I've got some provisions
that are on island.

04:08.875 --> 04:10.542
Is there any way
we can get it picked up?

04:10.583 --> 04:12.083
- Let me check with Captain
on that, but yeah.

04:12.125 --> 04:13.583
- All right.
That would be awesome.

04:13.583 --> 04:15.000
- Do you need 'em today?
- Yeah, yeah.

04:15.042 --> 04:16.583
It's for this evening's dinner.

04:16.583 --> 04:18.458
We're running out of
gluten-free, fat-free,

04:18.458 --> 04:21.125
dairy-free,
tasteless ingredients.

04:21.125 --> 04:22.208
Doesn't eat red meat.

04:22.250 --> 04:23.375
Someone doesn't like
seafood.

04:23.417 --> 04:24.917
Others do like seafood.

04:24.958 --> 04:26.875
Somehow, I'm gonna have to
make this crap

04:26.917 --> 04:28.917
actually taste like something.

04:30.417 --> 04:32.042
- Ben needs provisions
picked up from Road Town

04:32.083 --> 04:33.625
for tonight's dinner.

04:33.625 --> 04:35.542
- If you got to have 'em,
got to have 'em.

04:35.583 --> 04:37.542
- I'll take Lauren with me.

04:37.583 --> 04:39.083
- Make it quick.
- Thanks, Captain.

04:39.125 --> 04:40.583
- Okay, Emily?

04:40.625 --> 04:42.875
You being second stew,
you are lead on service.

04:42.917 --> 04:44.458
- Okay.
- Wow, babe.

04:44.500 --> 04:46.708
We're moving up in the world,
aren't we?

04:46.750 --> 04:47.750
- Oh, she's so...

04:52.750 --> 04:54.542
- We got to run to Road Town.
- Oh, yeah?

04:54.583 --> 04:55.875
- Yeah, and Nico?

04:55.917 --> 04:58.000
Can you start loading
the inflatable

04:58.000 --> 04:59.667
with all of the beach stuff?
- Yes.

04:59.667 --> 05:01.083
- You'll have Trevor
helping you

05:01.125 --> 05:02.417
and Barry helping you.

05:02.458 --> 05:03.500
Thank you so much.

05:06.792 --> 05:08.458
- Yay!

05:10.000 --> 05:11.500
- I like Ben.
He's nice.

05:11.542 --> 05:13.167
- Yeah.
- Are him and Kate...

05:13.167 --> 05:15.083
- No.
Kate's got a girlfriend.

05:15.125 --> 05:16.833
- What? Really?
A girlfriend?

05:16.833 --> 05:17.875
I had no idea.

05:27.208 --> 05:28.833
Why?
Are you interested?

05:28.833 --> 05:30.833
- Yeah, that's why
I was asking.

05:36.667 --> 05:38.750
- I don't know
where a cooler is.

05:40.708 --> 05:42.708
- Yeah, yeah.
For sure.

05:42.708 --> 05:44.500
I hate these picnics.
It sucks.

05:44.542 --> 05:46.542
It's a pain in the ass.
They always are.

05:46.542 --> 05:47.792
Trevor, Trevor?

05:47.833 --> 05:49.375
- Are you on the beach
right now?

05:49.417 --> 05:51.333
- I am on the beach, yes.

05:51.375 --> 05:53.208
- Pick a good spot.
Give 'em a little palm tree.

05:53.250 --> 05:54.875
I got to finish something
up here on the boat.

05:54.875 --> 05:56.208
I'll meet you at the beach
soon.

05:56.208 --> 05:58.625
Nico sold me out to Kelley,

05:58.667 --> 06:00.208
so if you're gonna
sh--talk me,

06:00.208 --> 06:02.208
you're gonna have to do
the sh-- work.

06:02.208 --> 06:04.208
- F---.

06:10.833 --> 06:12.792
- Come on, Trevor.
Where the f--- are you?

06:14.208 --> 06:15.542
- Talk to me.

06:15.542 --> 06:18.208
- Grilled asparagus
with lemon and pine nut.

06:18.208 --> 06:19.792
Oh, that felt good,
that cool air.

06:19.833 --> 06:21.542
- Really?
- Yeah, baby.

06:21.583 --> 06:24.250
- I was dating this guy,
and every morning,

06:24.250 --> 06:26.583
he would put cornstarch
on his balls

06:26.583 --> 06:29.250
and then stand in front
of the oscillating fan.

06:29.250 --> 06:32.667
It was like,
"My fan's broken."

06:34.583 --> 06:36.750
- Trevor, Trevor.
Come in, Trevor.

06:36.750 --> 06:38.500
- Go ahead, Nico.
- Yeah, Trevor,

06:38.542 --> 06:40.333
if I could maybe
get a hand out here?

06:40.375 --> 06:43.708
- So you were flapping
his corn starched balls.

06:43.750 --> 06:45.583
- I sat on the toilet.
He's like, "Ready? Go!

06:45.625 --> 06:47.667
So I went like this
really hard,

06:47.708 --> 06:49.375
and I whacked him
with the magazine.

06:50.708 --> 06:52.417
We're just talking
about balls.

06:52.458 --> 06:53.500
- All right.

06:59.208 --> 07:00.917
- I need this dry.

07:04.167 --> 07:05.708
- Probably 'cause there's
a lot of provisions.

07:05.750 --> 07:06.958
- Oh, is that what's happening?
- Yeah.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.292
- More drinks?

07:08.292 --> 07:09.458
- Actually, can I get
a glass of rosÃ©?

07:09.458 --> 07:10.917
- Glass of rosÃ©?

07:10.958 --> 07:13.542
- We need to write #beach party
with sticks.

07:19.917 --> 07:22.792
- There we go.

07:22.833 --> 07:24.250
You f---!

07:27.250 --> 07:28.542
Come on, man.

07:28.583 --> 07:30.708
At least act like
you're working.

07:30.750 --> 07:32.917
It's day three, and I'm ready
to throw this guy overboard.

07:32.958 --> 07:33.958
There's no "I" in "team."

07:33.958 --> 07:35.708
It's me and you, canopy.

07:35.750 --> 07:38.042
Oh, f---, yes.

07:42.458 --> 07:43.917
- Here you go.
Hold these.

07:43.958 --> 07:45.583
Two on each corner.
Wait to do that side.

07:45.625 --> 07:48.125
- What?
F---.

07:48.167 --> 07:50.458
Come on, man.

07:50.500 --> 07:53.625
- Kids that eat more
than 20 hot dogs a year

07:53.667 --> 07:56.667
have, like, a 15% higher chance
of getting childhood leukemia.

07:56.708 --> 07:58.125
- What?
- It's that bad.

08:00.042 --> 08:01.833
- Abandon ship.

08:04.833 --> 08:06.667
- What's in this thing?
A body?

08:07.833 --> 08:09.292
- Sorry that took so long.

08:09.333 --> 08:10.833
It was rough
on the south side of Tortola.

08:10.833 --> 08:12.333
- I'm sure it was.

08:12.375 --> 08:13.667
- You want to drop us off
over there and help?

08:13.667 --> 08:15.500
- Yeah, right, man.

08:15.500 --> 08:17.500
- It's a beach party.

08:17.542 --> 08:19.000
- Think this is
enough rosÃ© for them?

08:19.000 --> 08:20.750
- Yeah, I think so.

08:20.792 --> 08:24.167
- And then serving utensils
are also in that bag.

08:24.208 --> 08:26.667
It's refreshing
to finally have stewardesses

08:26.708 --> 08:30.042
who look up to me and respect me
and want to learn.

08:30.042 --> 08:32.042
- Oh, it's a bottle opener.
- It's in the bag

08:32.083 --> 08:34.375
that we just brought over.
- Okay.

08:34.375 --> 08:35.875
- 'Cause I would love
to pass on

08:35.917 --> 08:37.542
what I've learned.

08:37.583 --> 08:38.792
- Ready?
- Yup.

08:38.833 --> 08:40.042
- Isn't this rad?

08:40.083 --> 08:42.542
- I put in "#beach party"
in sticks, baby.

08:42.542 --> 08:44.333
- Y'all did a good job.
I like it.

08:44.375 --> 08:46.042
- Yeah.
It looks good.

08:46.083 --> 08:48.708
- Really? All he did was
move around a few sticks.

08:48.708 --> 08:50.375
Played in the sand like a child.

08:50.375 --> 08:52.542
- Trevor, when she goes back,
go on back with her.

08:52.583 --> 08:54.625
Wipe down the metal.
Have the boat looking good.

08:54.667 --> 08:56.792
And once this is all wrapped up,
we pick up.

08:56.833 --> 08:58.042
Then we'll take our break.

08:58.083 --> 08:59.792
- Come on.
Get in there.

08:59.833 --> 09:01.375
- It's cool!

09:03.542 --> 09:05.167
- How's it going?
- Good.

09:05.208 --> 09:07.000
- I think we're just ready
for our beach party.

09:07.042 --> 09:08.583
- Okay, great.

09:09.583 --> 09:11.042
- Go like that.

09:11.083 --> 09:12.917
And this can go like this.

09:12.917 --> 09:14.917
- No, I got it.

09:14.917 --> 09:17.917
- Chicken salad,
grilled asparagus...

09:17.917 --> 09:19.917
- Okay, the tender's ready
to take you to the beach.

09:19.917 --> 09:21.542
- Thank you.
- Great.

09:21.583 --> 09:23.750
- Ah!

09:23.750 --> 09:26.917
- Whoo!

09:26.917 --> 09:28.500
- Can you do waters?

09:28.542 --> 09:29.833
And then we can ask about
alcohol.

09:33.417 --> 09:36.000
- Shut up.
I love it.

09:36.042 --> 09:37.750
- Can I get anyone a drink?

09:37.792 --> 09:38.917
- I want to bronze.

09:41.792 --> 09:43.833
- This is unreal.
- You guys are beyond.

09:43.875 --> 09:45.083
- Cheers.

09:45.083 --> 09:47.000
- Cheers, ladies.

09:48.625 --> 09:50.042
- You know what?

09:50.083 --> 09:51.792
My phone actually locks
every two seconds.

09:51.833 --> 09:53.125
- Free chicken? No?

09:53.167 --> 09:55.083
- Is that gluten-free, right?
- Yes.

09:56.750 --> 09:58.542
- Kate, Kate.
- Go ahead.

09:58.583 --> 09:59.792
- The guests
are all doing great.

09:59.833 --> 10:00.917
- Good job, girls.

10:00.958 --> 10:02.375
- Copy that.
Okay.

10:02.417 --> 10:03.958
- What's your ideal time
for dinner?

10:04.000 --> 10:05.458
Because--
- 9:00, 10:00.

10:05.458 --> 10:07.250
Probably the same sh--
as last night, yeah?

10:07.292 --> 10:09.708
- If they say anything else,
you know what's coming out.

10:09.750 --> 10:10.875
- The bitch.

10:10.917 --> 10:11.792
- Mm-hmm.

10:11.833 --> 10:13.792
- Bring out Megabitch.

10:13.833 --> 10:17.375
- Why don't you go jump
off the boat and drown?

10:20.583 --> 10:22.125
- All right, we're going.

10:22.125 --> 10:23.750
- I'm gonna swim
as soon as I'm done eating.

10:23.792 --> 10:26.125
- Me too.
- Whoa, there it is.

10:26.167 --> 10:27.875
Mm.

10:27.917 --> 10:29.292
Ooh, Kelsey.

10:29.333 --> 10:31.417
Thank you, God,
for women like her.

10:34.167 --> 10:36.292
- Look at them.

10:36.333 --> 10:37.958
- Merci.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.167
- I only know German.
Bitte.

10:39.208 --> 10:41.292
- What did you say?
- Bitte.

10:41.333 --> 10:43.250
- Okay, bitte?
- Yeah, it's--

10:43.292 --> 10:44.667
You say danke for
thank you

10:44.667 --> 10:47.250
and bitte
for you're welcome.

10:47.292 --> 10:49.167
- It's gonna be great.
- Yup.

10:49.167 --> 10:50.500
- We're gonna drown.

10:50.500 --> 10:52.292
- They're really hands-on.

10:56.875 --> 10:58.833
You think they're hot?
- Yeah.

10:58.875 --> 11:00.667
- You good?

11:00.708 --> 11:02.333
That smile, man.

11:06.167 --> 11:07.458
Wow.

11:08.667 --> 11:10.792
- Those girls--

11:10.833 --> 11:12.167
hate to say it--

11:12.167 --> 11:14.542
will never marry
a guy like us.

11:15.875 --> 11:18.875
You got that right.

11:18.875 --> 11:20.542
- Coming up...

11:20.583 --> 11:22.208
- Hey, you want to come
down here to main deck?

11:22.208 --> 11:23.875
- I'm busy.

11:23.875 --> 11:26.375
- Guy has no respect
for anybody on this boat.

11:26.375 --> 11:27.958
Hey, next time
you tell me you're busy

11:28.000 --> 11:29.708
over the f---ing radio
where Captain Lee can hear,

11:29.750 --> 11:31.458
we're gonna have
serious f---ing issues.

11:35.875 --> 11:36.542
- Let's get the ladies.

11:36.292 --> 11:36.542
We got to go.

11:38.417 --> 11:41.042
- All right, ladies,
when you're ready!

11:41.083 --> 11:43.333
- One, two, three.
Run and jump.

11:46.500 --> 11:48.667
- Thank you, guys!

11:48.708 --> 11:50.833
- Beach party?

11:50.875 --> 11:52.792
First day
with all three stews.

11:52.833 --> 11:55.083
And I got two really good ones.

11:55.083 --> 11:58.708
- Kate is just tickled
with her interior crew.

11:58.750 --> 12:02.167
She feels like she just died
and went to stewardess heaven.

12:02.208 --> 12:04.333
- I feel like
God answered my prayers.

12:10.250 --> 12:11.875
- Thank you.

12:11.917 --> 12:14.333
- Did you have a good day?
I had such a good day.

12:14.375 --> 12:16.083
- I was here for, like,
a solid hour

12:16.083 --> 12:18.083
just 'cause I had to empty
all the sh-- by myself.

12:18.083 --> 12:19.708
Trevor came
at, like, the end.

12:19.750 --> 12:21.375
I was like, "I need
someone else out here."

12:21.417 --> 12:24.042
- Did you ask for that?
- Yeah, I had to.

12:24.083 --> 12:25.875
- Nico and I, like,
get along so well.

12:25.917 --> 12:27.333
If Trevor's, like,
annoying us,

12:27.375 --> 12:29.083
we can vent to each other
about it

12:29.125 --> 12:31.042
because it feels like we've
known each other for ages

12:31.083 --> 12:32.792
and it's like it's the first
charter, which is insane.

12:35.042 --> 12:38.125
Um, this is, like,
awkwardly romantic.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.750
- Skipping into the sunset?

12:44.333 --> 12:45.792
- Oh, my God, snacks?

12:45.792 --> 12:47.208
- Yay.

12:47.250 --> 12:48.458
- Okay, riddle me this:

12:48.500 --> 12:50.125
who doesn't like
a really big dick?

12:50.125 --> 12:51.125
You don't like a big dick?

12:51.125 --> 12:52.458
Explain to me why.

12:52.500 --> 12:54.083
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

12:54.125 --> 12:56.458
- Put it in.

12:56.500 --> 12:58.042
- I just have never met anyone

12:58.083 --> 12:59.208
who liked a small dick
over a big dick.

12:59.250 --> 13:00.458
So, like--
- Yeah.

13:00.458 --> 13:01.875
- Come here
for a second, girls.

13:01.917 --> 13:03.292
After turndowns are done,

13:03.292 --> 13:04.458
I'm gonna let you
knock off.

13:04.500 --> 13:06.125
- I'm 6:00 a.m.,
7:00 a.m.

13:06.125 --> 13:07.375
8:00 a.m., 9:00 a.m.

13:07.417 --> 13:08.917
- You're gonna be
the early girl.

13:08.958 --> 13:10.125
- Okay.
- I'll be up late with you.

13:10.125 --> 13:11.208
But I'll be up early.

13:11.250 --> 13:12.250
- I'm happy to do dishes.

13:12.292 --> 13:13.292
I'll help upstairs.

13:13.292 --> 13:14.292
- Sounds good, man.

13:14.292 --> 13:16.708
- Okay, thank you.

13:20.333 --> 13:23.083
- Got three more likes
from my #beach party

13:23.125 --> 13:24.333
with all the sticks and rocks.

13:24.333 --> 13:25.958
Maybe that'll boost tips.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.500
- Maybe what?
- What was it? Sticks? What?

13:29.500 --> 13:32.292
Ordinarily, I am a fan
of the underdog.

13:32.333 --> 13:34.333
- I raked the beach out,
and I found sticks,

13:34.333 --> 13:36.083
and I put a hashtag with sticks

13:36.125 --> 13:38.167
and spelled out "beach party"
into it.

13:38.167 --> 13:41.292
- But Trevor does strike me
as an odd duck.

13:41.333 --> 13:43.000
All right.
Nice job, mate.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.125
- Yeah.

13:47.708 --> 13:48.833
- So I'm here to help.

13:48.833 --> 13:50.750
- Look at that.
You look adorable.

13:50.792 --> 13:52.000
- I've had a lot
of kitchen experience.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.333
I used to work in restaurants.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.167
And so to be
in another department

13:55.167 --> 13:58.000
where it's almost like
refreshing and quite therapeutic

13:58.000 --> 14:00.042
when I do dishes and stuff,
'cause I just zone out.

14:00.083 --> 14:01.542
All right,
where would you like me?

14:01.583 --> 14:03.375
- Why don't we start stacking
the trays,

14:03.417 --> 14:06.208
stack them all up here,
and then put them away?

14:09.667 --> 14:11.625
- Emily, is there anything
we can do for you?

14:11.667 --> 14:13.208
- I don't think so.
We're all good.

14:13.250 --> 14:15.792
- All right, perfect.
- What are you doodling?

14:15.833 --> 14:17.875
Just doodling?
- I don't know, man.

14:17.875 --> 14:19.375
- Just say "doodling"
one more time for me.

14:19.417 --> 14:21.375
- Doodling.
- Yes, thank you.

14:21.417 --> 14:23.208
- What's wrong
with me saying "doodling"?

14:23.208 --> 14:25.875
- It's been five months, people.
Five.

14:25.875 --> 14:27.042
Women with accents

14:27.042 --> 14:28.708
is just wonderful
on the ears.

14:28.750 --> 14:30.333
- Whoo!
- That's a good one.

14:30.375 --> 14:32.000
- That is good! Yep.

14:32.042 --> 14:34.042
That's just like
1 of 20--yep.

14:34.083 --> 14:37.208
- Okay, all the guests are out
and ready when you are.

14:37.208 --> 14:38.292
- Thank you, baby.

14:39.875 --> 14:42.000
- I'm sorry.
- No, you're totally fine.

14:42.042 --> 14:43.417
- Pretty.

14:43.458 --> 14:45.833
- My love, can we get these--
just those--

14:45.875 --> 14:47.333
- Yeah, I can.
- It's all good.

14:47.375 --> 14:48.500
- Okay, what am I serving?

14:48.542 --> 14:50.167
- Pork scaloppini with...

14:50.208 --> 14:52.042
- Almonds, barley, butternut?

14:52.083 --> 14:53.250
What's the sauce?

14:53.292 --> 14:55.208
- It's a veal demi-glacÃ©.

14:55.250 --> 14:56.542
- Anything on the chicken?
Same way?

14:56.583 --> 14:58.000
Demi-glacÃ©?
- Yeah, yeah.

14:58.042 --> 15:00.042
No, no demi-glacÃ©.
- What is it?

15:00.083 --> 15:01.917
Teriyaki?
- Truffle balsamic.

15:01.958 --> 15:03.250
- Whatever.

15:03.250 --> 15:05.333
This is chicken
with almonds, barley,

15:05.375 --> 15:06.833
butternut squash,
and a demi-glacÃ©.

15:06.875 --> 15:08.542
- I don't think
I can have the barley.

15:08.583 --> 15:11.167
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
Let me get you another plate.

15:11.208 --> 15:13.917
I have no idea
why Ben is serving barley

15:13.958 --> 15:15.250
to a gluten-free guest.

15:15.292 --> 15:16.583
- What's up?
Is everything okay?

15:16.625 --> 15:17.917
- Everything's great.

15:17.958 --> 15:19.583
I just didn't want
to give Kelsey

15:19.583 --> 15:22.417
any that had touched barley,
if I could, you know?

15:22.458 --> 15:24.125
- Oh, f---.

15:24.167 --> 15:26.458
Barley has gluten in it.

15:26.458 --> 15:28.292
Yes, I did slip up.

15:28.333 --> 15:30.458
It's just really tough
to keep up

15:30.458 --> 15:32.125
with all of these restrictions.

15:32.125 --> 15:33.792
- How good is this food?

15:33.833 --> 15:36.083
- You did not have to do that.
Thank you so much.

15:37.792 --> 15:40.125
- I'm totally following Kelsey.
- But it might be weird.

15:40.167 --> 15:41.417
Like, this is a bit soon,
isn't it?

15:41.458 --> 15:42.917
- I just want to find her,

15:42.958 --> 15:44.292
and then I have her saved
in my searches.

15:44.333 --> 15:45.583
- Okay.
- Duh.

15:45.625 --> 15:47.125
- Kelley is
the sweetest thing ever.

15:47.125 --> 15:48.292
- He's adorable.
- He's so cute.

15:48.292 --> 15:49.542
- He's very cute.

15:49.583 --> 15:52.417
- She was giving me
googly eyes.

15:52.458 --> 15:55.208
- She's like, "Oh, my God."

15:55.250 --> 15:57.417
- I found love!
- They're all cute, though.

15:57.458 --> 15:59.250
I mean, what's going on, girls?
Get it on.

15:59.292 --> 16:00.458
- Yeah.
- We can make this happen.

16:00.500 --> 16:02.125
- I'm not into rich girls.

16:02.125 --> 16:03.458
You got to understand
that some rich girls

16:03.458 --> 16:05.250
just want to have fun.

16:05.292 --> 16:06.500
- Sierra, Sierra, Emily.

16:06.542 --> 16:07.667
- She in there?

16:07.667 --> 16:09.167
- Oh, Sierra.

16:09.208 --> 16:10.667
Sierra, want to join
the conversation?

16:10.708 --> 16:12.625
- Oh, sh--.

16:12.667 --> 16:14.333
- If you really want to know
what's going on in the boat,

16:14.333 --> 16:16.333
hide in the laundry room
for a couple hours.

16:16.333 --> 16:18.000
- Sierra,
did you copy that?

16:18.000 --> 16:19.333
- Yeah, I did. I'm sorry.
- Oh, hello.

16:19.333 --> 16:21.000
I'm--yeah.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.500
No, come down and help me
with turn-down.

16:22.500 --> 16:24.333
- My wi-fi is not working,

16:24.375 --> 16:27.500
and it's driving me up
up a f---ing tree.

16:27.500 --> 16:29.167
- Oh, my God!
Stop it!

16:29.167 --> 16:33.167
- Hi, guys.

16:33.167 --> 16:35.167
- Sorry about the barley.

16:35.167 --> 16:37.250
It slipped my mind.
- No, no, not at all.

16:37.292 --> 16:39.333
- You guys get
my Instagram post?

16:40.958 --> 16:42.500
- Mine just dinged really loud.

16:42.500 --> 16:45.000
- That was my ding.
"Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding."

16:45.042 --> 16:47.667
- Oh, wait, you're not even
through your filter.

16:47.708 --> 16:49.208
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, my God.

16:50.708 --> 16:52.208
- I'm actually starting
to question

16:52.250 --> 16:53.375
whether they're eating the food

16:53.417 --> 16:55.375
or just posting it on Instagram.

16:55.417 --> 16:57.000
- Your Instagram...

16:57.042 --> 16:58.500
- Okay, guys, thank you.

17:01.583 --> 17:03.542
F---ing hell.
Wow.

17:03.583 --> 17:05.042
Next time, like,
it would be nice

17:05.083 --> 17:06.375
if they spoke English.

17:15.042 --> 17:17.208
- Can we get
on the walkie-talkies?

17:17.208 --> 17:18.875
- Wait, wait, wait.
- How do we do it?

17:18.875 --> 17:19.958
Kelley, Kelley?

17:21.375 --> 17:23.375
- Kelley for Kiki.

17:23.375 --> 17:25.125
- This is Kelley.
Go ahead, Kiki.

17:25.167 --> 17:28.208
- Hi.
- Hi. How are you?

17:28.250 --> 17:30.708
I have a rule.

17:30.750 --> 17:33.250
I can't...touch her.

17:33.292 --> 17:35.167
Even though I'd love to put
my hands all over her.

17:35.208 --> 17:36.917
- Lisa on behalf of Kiki.

17:36.958 --> 17:39.583
She's requesting your presence
on the sky deck.

17:41.958 --> 17:44.083
- Roger that.
I'll be up in a few.

17:44.125 --> 17:46.417
But it's Kelsey calling.
It's like an angel.

17:46.417 --> 17:48.375
I laid this rule out
with my deckhands,

17:48.417 --> 17:50.083
so I sure in the hell
can't break it.

17:50.083 --> 17:51.583
- Get off the radio.

17:51.583 --> 17:54.083
- Okay.
- Oh!

17:54.125 --> 17:56.667
- Uh-uh.
- Whoo!

17:56.708 --> 17:58.042
- When a charter guest
hits on you,

17:58.083 --> 17:59.583
you have to be kind of polite,

17:59.625 --> 18:01.500
'cause you're stuck on a boat
with them.

18:04.208 --> 18:06.333
But in this case,
the charter guest

18:06.375 --> 18:08.500
is clearly interested,
as is he.

18:08.542 --> 18:09.750
It's cute.

18:09.750 --> 18:11.250
- I did not do this.

18:11.292 --> 18:12.458
- Yeah, uh-huh.

18:12.500 --> 18:14.125
Sure.
- It wasn't, I swear.

18:14.167 --> 18:15.458
- You red or yellow?

18:15.458 --> 18:17.083
- The yellow has
the smiley faces on it,

18:17.125 --> 18:19.125
so you get that,
and I want the emojis.

18:19.167 --> 18:21.208
The emojis are
my favorite part.

18:22.625 --> 18:24.542
Current mood.

18:24.583 --> 18:26.125
- That's your current mood?

18:26.125 --> 18:28.708
- Yeah, this one.

18:30.792 --> 18:32.458
- Someone out there,
tell me a story

18:32.500 --> 18:34.958
where a girl like this
hooks up with a guy like me.

18:34.958 --> 18:36.458
I'm basically a butler.

18:36.500 --> 18:38.458
I'm an outside butler
that sets up toys.

18:38.458 --> 18:41.042
Like, seriously, though,
when does the butler

18:41.083 --> 18:43.625
ever get the hot girl
that's rich?

18:43.625 --> 18:45.625
- Oh, I'm so sorry!

18:45.625 --> 18:47.625
- Oh, my God!
No!

18:47.625 --> 18:49.292
I wasn't even
paying attention.

18:49.292 --> 18:50.625
Oh!

18:50.667 --> 18:52.500
- I'm sorry.

18:52.500 --> 18:54.667
- You guys,
we should all go to bed.

18:54.708 --> 18:56.250
- Thank you
for coming up with us.

18:56.292 --> 18:58.583
- Yeah, you're welcome.
- Good night, ladies.

18:58.625 --> 19:00.000
- Bedtime.

19:00.042 --> 19:02.000
- Do you like her?

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
- F---.
She's so pretty.

19:04.042 --> 19:06.583
- Is she?
- Yeah.

19:06.625 --> 19:07.833
- Coming up...

19:07.833 --> 19:09.167
- But it's your job
to do the toast.

19:09.208 --> 19:10.833
- They just asked me
to do the toast.

19:10.833 --> 19:12.667
I didn't know there was
even toast happening.

19:12.667 --> 19:14.792
- Oh, okay! I realize
you don't give a f---, Kate,

19:14.833 --> 19:16.333
but I still do.

19:16.333 --> 19:18.125
- Come here.
- For, like, to show the kids.

19:18.167 --> 19:19.667
- He's just being
the biggest hypocrite

19:19.667 --> 19:20.958
I've ever seen.

19:28.667 --> 19:32.125
- Are you guys not liking
the fact that?

19:32.167 --> 19:34.042
- Chelsea's pretty cute, huh?

19:34.042 --> 19:36.708
I think Kelsey, and then it goes
to Nicole, maybe.

19:36.708 --> 19:38.208
- Which Nicole?
Top one?

19:38.250 --> 19:40.542
- I think the top one,
though, is 34.

19:40.542 --> 19:43.208
See, the bottom one's 26,
so I'm gonna go with the 26.

19:43.208 --> 19:45.625
How old are you?
- 22 this year.

19:45.667 --> 19:48.208
- 22? How old are you?
- I'm 22 now.

19:48.250 --> 19:50.292
- 24, going on 25.
- Oh, wow.

19:50.333 --> 19:51.792
- Young crew.
- Yeah.

19:51.833 --> 19:54.042
That's what I am liking
about this crew so far.

19:54.083 --> 19:56.042
And everybody seems to know
their sh-- real well.

19:56.042 --> 19:57.375
Me and Kelley were
a little bit nervous

19:57.375 --> 19:58.625
at the start.

19:58.667 --> 20:00.708
What's your wrist say?

20:00.708 --> 20:02.333
- "Relentless."

20:04.833 --> 20:06.625
- This one's just
a giant jellyfish.

20:06.667 --> 20:08.458
- What's the meaning?

20:08.500 --> 20:10.875
- A good friend in Puerto Rico
passed away surfing big waves,

20:10.875 --> 20:12.625
and then on my ribs, it says,

20:12.667 --> 20:15.125
"Wash out the fading away
with the rising tide."

20:15.167 --> 20:16.333
- Were you with him?
- Yeah.

20:16.375 --> 20:17.833
- That's really hard.

20:17.875 --> 20:19.833
- It's just a reminder,
like, you know,

20:19.875 --> 20:21.750
anybody can be taken
at any time.

20:21.792 --> 20:23.583
You know, enjoy life
to the fullest.

20:23.583 --> 20:25.417
You got one chance.
Take it.

20:25.417 --> 20:26.708
And be who you want to be.

20:26.750 --> 20:28.500
- It's good
that they mean something.

20:28.542 --> 20:30.667
- This one's a black sheep
eating a mushroom,

20:30.708 --> 20:32.833
so it means never follow
the herd.

20:32.875 --> 20:34.375
Always be willing to get weird.

20:34.417 --> 20:36.750
That's way cool.

20:36.750 --> 20:39.708
- Trevor definitely is
f---ing weird.

20:39.750 --> 20:41.375
- This one says,
"Live and let live."

20:41.417 --> 20:42.542
The old oxen skull.

20:49.417 --> 20:51.667
- Oh, man.
Take it in.

20:54.250 --> 20:55.750
- Good morning.
- Hi, Kate.

20:55.792 --> 20:57.208
- Hi.
Did you all sleep well?

20:57.250 --> 20:58.583
- It was amazing.
- Awesome.

20:58.625 --> 21:00.542
- I slept well,
but I'm so sad to leave.

21:00.583 --> 21:03.625
- Aw.
- That's a very high compliment.

21:03.625 --> 21:05.917
- Sierra, Sierra, Lee.

21:07.583 --> 21:09.708
Is anybody from Interior
up yet?

21:09.750 --> 21:12.458
I'd just like a cup of coffee
if somebody's got a second.

21:12.458 --> 21:14.958
- I've got it.
I'm on my way.

21:14.958 --> 21:16.708
I was a nanny
prior to working on a boat,

21:16.750 --> 21:18.583
so there's a lot of similarities

21:18.625 --> 21:20.625
between charter guests
and a baby.

21:20.625 --> 21:23.750
They need a lot of catering to
and attention.

21:23.792 --> 21:24.958
So it helped me a lot.

21:26.958 --> 21:29.292
Wait'll you see this.

21:29.292 --> 21:31.292
Maybe she's not
the domestic type.

21:31.292 --> 21:33.250
What do you think?

21:33.292 --> 21:35.292
The sugar's still in it,
though.

21:35.292 --> 21:36.417
Time release.

21:36.458 --> 21:37.792
- Kate?
- Yeah, hi.

21:37.792 --> 21:39.333
- Just gonna fess up to you.

21:39.333 --> 21:40.833
I overslept this morning.

21:40.875 --> 21:42.917
- Okay.
- I'm so sorry.

21:42.958 --> 21:44.667
- Um, I don't really care
if it happens once,

21:44.708 --> 21:46.000
but if it happens
a couple times--

21:46.000 --> 21:47.833
- It won't.

21:47.833 --> 21:49.833
- You know that you didn't
do it on purpose.

21:49.875 --> 21:52.917
She's learning, and there's
error when you're learning.

21:52.958 --> 21:54.833
- I'm so sorry.
- It happens.

21:54.875 --> 21:57.333
- Stand by; we'll be pulling
the hook and getting under way.

21:57.333 --> 21:59.583
- Roger that.
- I'll give the direction.

21:59.625 --> 22:01.000
- I'm ready.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.292
What the f--- does that mean?

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
I'm not quite sure
where Trevor's going

22:13.000 --> 22:15.167
with this whole
arm signal stuff.

22:15.167 --> 22:16.625
Just tell me
it's off the bottom.

22:16.667 --> 22:18.458
Don't sit there like--
you know,

22:18.500 --> 22:20.333
I don't know,
with a limp dick motion

22:20.375 --> 22:22.875
or whatever the hell that means.

22:22.875 --> 22:25.792
- Okay, Captain,
anchor's at the water line.

22:25.833 --> 22:27.375
- Bring it up and put it home.

22:27.375 --> 22:30.792
You see, I just need
clear, precise communication.

22:30.833 --> 22:32.500
It's really simple.

22:39.750 --> 22:42.375
- All right, lovelies.
- Thank you.

22:42.375 --> 22:43.958
- Wait, did you get his number?

22:44.000 --> 22:45.542
- No.
It'll be fine.

22:47.333 --> 22:48.833
- We're following each other
on the 'Gram,

22:48.875 --> 22:50.625
so there will be DMs.

22:50.667 --> 22:52.708
- Oh! Aw, well,
that didn't work, did it?

22:52.750 --> 22:54.333
Guys, you need
a toaster up here.

22:54.375 --> 22:55.792
Did we do that?
Did we do that?

22:55.833 --> 22:57.542
- Why--
- Did we do that?

22:57.542 --> 22:58.875
- No.
Why are you yelling?

22:58.875 --> 22:59.958
Why are you shouting?

23:00.000 --> 23:01.458
- Because I just burnt
the toast,

23:01.500 --> 23:02.667
and I burnt it yesterday,
and it's not my job.

23:02.708 --> 23:04.333
It's your job.
That's why.

23:04.375 --> 23:06.542
- Then just give me the bread
and stop screaming.

23:06.583 --> 23:08.167
- Just bring the toaster
up here.

23:08.208 --> 23:09.917
- Let's hide this,
because we've got a chef.

23:09.917 --> 23:11.667
- What are we hiding?
- The toaster.

23:11.708 --> 23:13.708
Keep it handy in the bilge.
- Come on.

23:13.750 --> 23:15.417
It's the stewardesses' job
to do the toast.

23:15.458 --> 23:18.167
- Okay, I'll handle the toast.
Put it in the bilge.

23:18.208 --> 23:19.750
I love working with Ben,

23:19.792 --> 23:22.875
but there is one time
that is a no-safe zone.

23:22.917 --> 23:25.750
Anything that happens
during breakfast service,

23:25.750 --> 23:28.083
Ben is going to have
a freak-out.

23:28.125 --> 23:31.417
- I realize you don't give
a f---, Kate, but I still do.

23:31.417 --> 23:32.542
Is that all right?

23:32.583 --> 23:34.042
- I totally care

23:34.083 --> 23:35.750
about the level
of service and quality.

23:35.750 --> 23:37.583
I just don't appreciate
being interrupted--

23:37.583 --> 23:38.875
- But it's your job
to do the toast.

23:38.917 --> 23:40.583
- Then just ask me
to do the toast.

23:40.625 --> 23:42.417
I didn't know there was
even toast happening.

23:42.458 --> 23:43.708
- Oh, okay.
I get it.

23:43.750 --> 23:45.042
You take it real personally.

23:45.083 --> 23:46.417
- All right, Ben.

23:46.458 --> 23:47.792
- Ready to go.

23:47.792 --> 23:49.042
- This was an amazing
experience.

23:49.083 --> 23:50.542
- I like that everyone, like,

23:50.583 --> 23:52.042
went out of their comfort zone

23:52.083 --> 23:53.875
and, like, went along with
the energy of it.

23:53.917 --> 23:55.625
- It's a testament to you.

23:55.625 --> 23:57.875
- Aw, it's not.
It's a testament to everybody.

23:57.917 --> 23:59.583
- Thank you so much
for organizing this.

23:59.625 --> 24:01.125
- Cheers to you guys.

24:01.125 --> 24:03.417
Cheers to you guys for coming.

24:03.458 --> 24:05.208
- Sorry about that.
- Things are exploding.

24:06.583 --> 24:07.958
- I know; you're an artist.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.625
You had time
to sit with your thoughts.

24:09.625 --> 24:11.458
- Yeah, I'm good now.

24:11.500 --> 24:13.125
- Any peace between Ben and I

24:13.125 --> 24:15.292
is always a temporary peace...

24:15.292 --> 24:17.042
We're happy again.
- I'm telling you that.

24:17.083 --> 24:18.958
- I don't want to talk
about the past.

24:18.958 --> 24:21.458
'Cause you know there's always
gonna be another charter

24:21.500 --> 24:23.542
that wants to eat breakfast.

24:23.583 --> 24:24.792
- Hugs, a little bit?

24:24.833 --> 24:26.333
Just a--

24:26.333 --> 24:28.000
I know; it's awkward
and weird.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.667
Okay, that was--

24:29.708 --> 24:32.083
- Let's get ready
on the aft deck.

24:32.125 --> 24:34.625
- Cap, you have 40 feet
and closing

24:34.667 --> 24:36.000
on your starboard aft quarter.

24:36.042 --> 24:38.458
- Got it?
- Lock that bow down.

24:38.500 --> 24:39.667
- Lock the bow down.

24:39.667 --> 24:41.458
Docking's extremely dangerous,

24:41.500 --> 24:43.833
because you're moving
a couple hundred-ton vessel

24:43.833 --> 24:45.417
next to a floating dock

24:45.458 --> 24:47.458
that, if you nudge it,
gives way.

24:47.500 --> 24:50.000
Keep going. Keep going.
Keep going. Keep going.

24:50.042 --> 24:52.000
All right. No, that line
needs to come tighter.

24:52.042 --> 24:53.833
- Copy that.

24:53.875 --> 24:55.500
- Tight, tight.
Come on.

24:55.500 --> 24:57.792
- Tighten up on him.
- Hey, hey, wait.

24:57.833 --> 24:59.500
Tighten up, or he's
bringing it back over.

24:59.542 --> 25:01.833
- You don't need
to take 14 wraps before you...

25:01.875 --> 25:03.500
- Lock it down?
- Yeah.

25:03.542 --> 25:04.792
- You're f---ing killing me,
guys.

25:06.167 --> 25:07.667
Trevor needs to control
his mouth.

25:07.708 --> 25:09.208
Just do it.

25:09.250 --> 25:11.042
- Pull, pull.
- Let's go. Let's go.

25:11.042 --> 25:13.000
- Let's go. Lock it down.
- Get that bow line tight.

25:13.042 --> 25:14.667
- Copy.

25:14.708 --> 25:16.042
- Happy, Cap?

25:16.042 --> 25:17.625
- Can't get it
any closer than that.

25:20.208 --> 25:21.708
- You never back
to the captain,

25:21.750 --> 25:23.125
especially Captain Lee.

25:23.167 --> 25:24.208
It's just disrespectful.

25:24.208 --> 25:25.792
- Whoo!

25:25.833 --> 25:27.125
- Coming up...

25:27.167 --> 25:28.542
- My deckhands
don't listen to me.

25:28.542 --> 25:29.792
- You should be guiding them.

25:29.833 --> 25:31.542
You shouldn't be
bossing them around.

25:31.583 --> 25:33.542
I don't boss them around,
and I'm the boatswain.

25:33.542 --> 25:35.125
- F---.

25:38.250 --> 25:39.042
- I just want a picture.

25:38.708 --> 25:39.042
- How's it going?

25:41.000 --> 25:42.875
- Can you have Kelley, Nico,
and Trevor come?

25:42.917 --> 25:43.875
- Yeah.

25:43.917 --> 25:44.958
I need all the deck crew

25:45.000 --> 25:46.333
in the sky lounge, please.

25:46.375 --> 25:47.875
They want to take photos
with y'all.

25:47.917 --> 25:50.000
- Let's go, Trevor.
I don't mind attention.

25:50.042 --> 25:51.500
I'll eat it up all day long.

25:51.542 --> 25:52.917
- Kelley's just look so good.

25:52.958 --> 25:54.208
- This is so cute.

25:54.250 --> 25:55.667
- You guys all have
very nice feet.

25:55.708 --> 25:57.167
- They must get pedicures.

25:57.208 --> 25:59.917
- I'm gonna be famous now
on Instagram.

25:59.958 --> 26:02.083
Let me--let me do this.

26:02.125 --> 26:04.083
- Come here.
- For, like, to show the kids.

26:04.125 --> 26:06.083
- Where's the ring?
- Where's Skipper?

26:06.125 --> 26:07.708
- I don't know.

26:07.750 --> 26:09.542
- Kelley gives us
this huge splurge

26:09.583 --> 26:11.750
on how not to get close
to the guests,

26:11.792 --> 26:14.583
and then all of a sudden,
he's all about Kelsey

26:14.583 --> 26:16.500
and just being the biggest
hypocrite I've ever seen.

26:16.542 --> 26:18.667
- Guys, like,
we're all taking selfies?

26:18.708 --> 26:20.542
- All crew, I need you
on the aft deck

26:20.583 --> 26:22.583
in ten.

26:22.583 --> 26:25.583
- Is this yours?
- Yes.

26:25.583 --> 26:27.083
- Well, we had them
on three carts

26:27.083 --> 26:28.500
on the way here.

26:28.542 --> 26:30.250
- Bags, bags.
This one ready?

26:30.292 --> 26:31.792
- But we only have two carts?

26:31.792 --> 26:34.708
Kelley, Kelley, Trevor.

26:34.750 --> 26:36.625
- Yeah, this is Kelley.
- You want to run and go get

26:36.625 --> 26:38.208
another cart for me?
- F---ing idiot.

26:40.292 --> 26:41.958
- I can--I can do it.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.792
- I can't say anything;
there's no say-so,

26:43.833 --> 26:46.083
'cause he just comes back with,
"I'm your f---ing boss."

26:46.125 --> 26:47.750
The captain's our boss.

26:47.792 --> 26:49.542
You know, we have
the exact same experience.

26:49.583 --> 26:52.292
You got to give me
some f---ing control.

26:52.292 --> 26:54.292
- Oh, my God, I'm, like,
sad that it's over.

26:54.292 --> 26:56.292
- I thought it was like
sleep-away camp for adults.

26:56.292 --> 26:57.958
Like, living with girls
you don't know,

26:57.958 --> 26:59.583
and you're like,
"Hi, I'm so-and-so."

26:59.625 --> 27:01.125
It's like the best experience
of your life.

27:01.125 --> 27:02.917
- I don't want to disembark.

27:03.958 --> 27:05.292
- Thank you guys so much.

27:05.333 --> 27:06.625
It was so awesome.

27:06.625 --> 27:09.208
- Good-bye.

27:09.250 --> 27:10.792
- Farewell.

27:12.125 --> 27:13.667
It was so nice meeting you.

27:13.708 --> 27:16.125
See you later.

27:16.167 --> 27:18.667
- Okay.
- I love you.

27:18.667 --> 27:20.750
You're an amazing team.
You're so kind.

27:20.792 --> 27:22.667
Like, I kind of felt like
you were my friends.

27:22.667 --> 27:25.500
Your meals--I came out feeling
like a little pregnant.

27:25.542 --> 27:27.667
I'm leaving feeling like
I'm about to have triplets.

27:27.667 --> 27:28.833
Everybody was amazing.

27:28.833 --> 27:30.000
Your hashtags--

27:30.000 --> 27:31.833
Just all of you
were unbelievable.

27:31.875 --> 27:34.500
So that's for all of you.
- Thank you.

27:34.500 --> 27:35.667
- #LoveYouAll.

27:35.667 --> 27:36.917
Bye, guys!

27:36.958 --> 27:39.083
- Whether me and Kelsey
continue talking

27:39.125 --> 27:41.750
after she gets off charter
is to be foreseen,

27:41.792 --> 27:43.333
but I'll keep my fingers
crossed.

27:43.333 --> 27:45.000
I want that to happen.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.167
- Time to go to work.

27:48.042 --> 27:49.292
- So what now?

27:49.333 --> 27:51.083
- Now we get
the boat ready again.

27:51.125 --> 27:53.333
Are you loving it?
- Yes.

27:56.750 --> 27:58.667
- Nico's really cute.
How old are you?

27:58.708 --> 27:59.875
- 21.

27:59.917 --> 28:01.958
- He's 22.
He's a year older.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.958
- My last boyfriend,
he was boatswain,

28:04.000 --> 28:05.875
and I was a junior stewardess.

28:05.917 --> 28:07.333
And then I ended it with him.

28:07.375 --> 28:09.375
- In, like, six years,

28:09.417 --> 28:12.208
he's gonna be
the hottest thing on the planet.

28:12.208 --> 28:13.875
- Really?
- Yes.

28:13.875 --> 28:15.125
- If I were to have
some magic dust

28:15.167 --> 28:16.708
and build my own boyfriend,

28:16.750 --> 28:20.042
he'd have brains, experience,
be witty,

28:20.083 --> 28:23.208
not too hairy.

28:23.250 --> 28:26.792
And I'm not too fussed
about hands or feet or...

28:28.042 --> 28:30.958
Genitalia size.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.125
- You guys would be
a really cute couple.

28:32.167 --> 28:33.958
- Maybe.

28:34.000 --> 28:35.542
- If he wasn't 22
and I wasn't a lesbian...

28:35.583 --> 28:37.083
- Attention, all crew.

28:37.083 --> 28:39.083
I need everybody
in the crew mess in two minutes.

28:39.083 --> 28:40.750
Two minutes, please.

28:40.792 --> 28:42.333
- Hey, girl.

28:42.375 --> 28:44.583
- Come on.
Yup, yup, sit here.

28:44.625 --> 28:45.833
Sit here.

28:45.875 --> 28:47.083
I just want to see my tip.

28:47.083 --> 28:49.250
I want to taste it.

28:49.292 --> 28:50.667
I want to eat it.

28:50.708 --> 28:52.333
I want to have it in my pants.

28:52.375 --> 28:54.917
- All in all, I think
everything went really good.

28:54.958 --> 28:59.417
Your interior staff, I think,
is going to be very good.

28:59.417 --> 29:01.917
- Captain Lee never really gives
a full compliment.

29:01.917 --> 29:04.083
He really means we're amazing.

29:04.125 --> 29:07.167
- Your deck staff, I think,
is doing okay.

29:07.208 --> 29:08.708
What I'd like to see

29:08.750 --> 29:11.333
is everybody just
dial it back a little bit,

29:11.375 --> 29:13.083
especially the new guys.

29:13.083 --> 29:14.917
- "Dial it back"?
Just, like,

29:14.917 --> 29:17.708
I haven't gotten congratulated
on anything I've done.

29:17.750 --> 29:18.958
I know I raised
the charter tips.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.292
- This is not a sprint.

29:21.292 --> 29:22.917
This is a marathon.

29:22.958 --> 29:26.083
And I don't want to see
anybody crash and burn.

29:26.125 --> 29:30.250
And on that note,
the charter was very happy.

29:30.292 --> 29:31.958
15 large.

29:31.958 --> 29:34.125
$1,360 per person.

29:34.125 --> 29:35.292
Not a bad way
to start out.

29:35.292 --> 29:36.958
- I'm so happy with the tip.

29:36.958 --> 29:38.958
We pulled it off.
It was our first charter.

29:38.958 --> 29:42.125
And so far, so good.
I think we've got a good team.

29:42.125 --> 29:43.958
- I'll get up for that,
for sure.

29:45.250 --> 29:47.625
- Thank you.

29:47.667 --> 29:50.125
$1,300 and s--

29:50.167 --> 29:51.792
or it evened out to--

29:51.792 --> 29:54.208
it broke down to 13 and...

29:54.250 --> 29:55.708
Um, whatever.

29:55.750 --> 29:56.792
My mind was blown.

29:56.792 --> 29:58.292
- You can go out this evening,

29:58.292 --> 30:00.000
grab dinner, couple pops.

30:00.042 --> 30:01.833
But tomorrow is a work day.

30:01.833 --> 30:04.000
Exercise good judgment
this evening.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
Okay, good job, everybody.

30:05.042 --> 30:07.000
- Thank you.
- Whoo!

30:07.000 --> 30:08.958
- Go to work.

30:13.333 --> 30:15.167
- We have to do the decks
as well, don't we?

30:15.208 --> 30:16.750
- Okay, I'm gonna grab
one more bucket

30:16.792 --> 30:18.125
and put this down here.

30:18.167 --> 30:20.833
- Let's go around
and strip all the beds,

30:20.875 --> 30:23.500
put all the sheets
in a large pillowcase.

30:23.542 --> 30:25.167
You guys can go through
this cabin.

30:25.208 --> 30:28.125
You do the other one.
And then maybe split that one.

30:28.167 --> 30:29.292
- You look so happy.

30:29.333 --> 30:31.292
- She always looks so happy.

30:31.333 --> 30:33.417
- Yay.

30:33.458 --> 30:35.250
- Where's Trevor at?

30:38.833 --> 30:40.583
- You bought a car?

30:40.625 --> 30:43.000
- Toyota 4Runner.
- 4Runner, okay.

30:43.042 --> 30:45.958
- You've got 154 foot of yacht
to clean,

30:46.000 --> 30:48.167
and with me sitting
right in front of you,

30:48.208 --> 30:49.667
you're buying a truck?

30:49.708 --> 30:51.500
- I got to go down
and get my account number

30:51.542 --> 30:53.000
and routing number.

30:53.042 --> 30:54.375
- Moron.

30:56.042 --> 30:57.208
- Sorry, where you up to here?

30:57.250 --> 30:58.958
- The stainless needs
washing--

30:59.000 --> 31:00.875
- Nico, Nico, Lauren.
- Go ahead.

31:00.917 --> 31:02.125
- I'm down here
trying to figure out

31:02.167 --> 31:03.708
this accounting stuff,

31:03.750 --> 31:06.500
but could you just continue on
on both stairwells

31:06.542 --> 31:08.375
before you start washing
the main deck?

31:08.417 --> 31:10.625
- Yeah, yeah, we're already
on bridge deck aft.

31:10.667 --> 31:12.292
- Thank you.

31:12.333 --> 31:14.542
- Thanks, boss.
- That's ridiculous.

31:14.542 --> 31:16.292
If I have a radio,
I wouldn't be like,

31:16.333 --> 31:17.375
"Oh, hey, I'm up here.

31:17.375 --> 31:19.167
Can you please get started
on this?"

31:19.208 --> 31:21.000
- "Hey, I can't finish this.
Can you start it out for me?"

31:21.042 --> 31:23.375
- Yeah, exactly.
- It's just a nonstop battle

31:23.417 --> 31:24.708
that we're having
with this guy

31:24.750 --> 31:26.208
making us work twice as much

31:26.250 --> 31:28.000
'cause we're spending
half our day

31:28.042 --> 31:30.583
talking about Trevor,
half our day talking to Trevor.

31:30.625 --> 31:33.042
So it's just affecting us all
as a team.

31:33.083 --> 31:35.167
- Hey, Lauren, what's been
going on with our toilet?

31:35.208 --> 31:36.583
- I don't think
it's flushing properly.

31:36.625 --> 31:38.250
- You know who to call for that?

31:38.250 --> 31:40.167
- Yeah, boss man.

31:40.208 --> 31:42.417
Trevor's the second engineer
on the boat,

31:42.458 --> 31:44.083
so when you have
a clogged toilet,

31:44.125 --> 31:45.375
who are you gonna call?

31:45.417 --> 31:47.083
Number two.

31:47.083 --> 31:48.583
- Listen, y'all.
Karma's real.

31:50.375 --> 31:53.542
- Trevor, Trevor, Kate.
- Go ahead, Kate.

31:53.583 --> 31:56.250
- There's a plumbing issue
in the crew cabin.

31:56.292 --> 31:59.250
There's just some stuff
that shouldn't be there,

31:59.250 --> 32:01.167
and it still is there.

32:01.208 --> 32:04.208
If you could get that
to go away, that'd be great.

32:04.250 --> 32:05.750
- Soon as I finish,
I'll come check it out.

32:05.792 --> 32:07.958
- Yeah, it'll be there waiting.

32:08.000 --> 32:11.292
Sierra, Sierra, Kate.

32:11.292 --> 32:13.542
- Hello.
- Hi.

32:18.500 --> 32:21.292
- Why aren't you flushing,
you f---ing bastard?

32:24.458 --> 32:25.458
Ugh!

32:25.458 --> 32:27.042
Girls, lay off the fiber.

32:27.083 --> 32:29.042
God damn!

32:29.083 --> 32:31.125
- Just so you know,
the roller iron was still on.

32:31.125 --> 32:32.958
Just turn it off.
- Yeah, it was in the restroom.

32:32.958 --> 32:34.458
I'm so sorry.
- No, that's okay.

32:34.458 --> 32:36.083
I am a little bit worried,

32:36.125 --> 32:37.917
because Sierra
is always smiling.

32:37.958 --> 32:39.542
- It won't happen again.

32:39.583 --> 32:41.458
- Just always turn it off
when you leave the room.

32:41.458 --> 32:43.083
She has happy resting face.

32:43.125 --> 32:45.125
You know who has those?
Lunatics.

32:45.125 --> 32:46.292
And Labradors.

32:46.333 --> 32:48.000
- Okay. Thank you.
- Thank you.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.292
- Oh, so gross.

32:55.792 --> 32:58.292
I want a cocktail.

32:58.333 --> 32:59.833
- Trevor, hey,

32:59.875 --> 33:01.417
you want to come down here
to main deck?

33:01.458 --> 33:03.458
- I'm busy.

33:03.500 --> 33:05.917
- Uh, yeah.
Come down here.

33:05.958 --> 33:07.083
- Okay.

33:09.000 --> 33:10.083
- "I'm busy."

33:10.125 --> 33:11.667
F---ing out of your mind.

33:11.667 --> 33:13.417
Meet me on main deck aft.

33:13.458 --> 33:16.458
Guy has no respect
for anybody on this boat.

33:18.167 --> 33:20.500
- This is Kelley's first time
as a boatswain.

33:20.500 --> 33:22.000
I've actually been a boatswain.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.333
Oh, f---.

33:23.375 --> 33:25.167
If Kelley didn't have
such a big ego,

33:25.208 --> 33:27.583
he'd realize that I could
actually show him

33:27.625 --> 33:29.333
how to be a good boatswain.

33:29.375 --> 33:31.000
- Hey, next time
you tell me you're busy

33:31.042 --> 33:32.958
over the f---ing radio,
where Captain Lee can hear,

33:33.000 --> 33:34.208
I'm gonna have
serious f---ing issues.

33:34.208 --> 33:35.667
I'm your f---ing boss,

33:35.708 --> 33:37.292
so you don't tell me
you're f---ing busy.

33:37.333 --> 33:38.292
- Coming up...

33:38.333 --> 33:39.792
- I'm gonna go to bed now.

33:39.833 --> 33:41.500
I'm not dealing with this.

33:41.542 --> 33:43.292
- Why do you take everything
so harsh?

33:43.333 --> 33:45.417
- Good job, senior deckhand.
- Hey, hey, hey.

33:48.417 --> 33:49.750
- Next time

33:48.667 --> 33:49.750
you tell me you're busy

33:49.875 --> 33:51.125
over the f---ing radio,

33:50.292 --> 33:51.125
where Captain Lee can hear,

33:51.208 --> 33:53.083
I'm gonna have

33:51.500 --> 33:53.083
serious f---ing issues.

33:53.208 --> 33:54.625
The way you communicate

33:53.625 --> 33:54.625
is not working out.

33:54.708 --> 33:55.542
- I'm trying my best.

33:55.167 --> 33:55.542
I'm sweating my ass off.

33:57.667 --> 33:59.375
And then, yeah, I get chewed
the f--- out by Kelley,

33:59.417 --> 34:01.208
and I don't know how much more
I can bite my tongue.

34:01.208 --> 34:02.792
- All right.
- All right.

34:06.208 --> 34:07.667
- Ugh, we just finished.

34:07.708 --> 34:09.208
- Yes.

34:09.208 --> 34:10.583
Favorite shirt.

34:12.375 --> 34:14.750
- You happy now?
- Not yet. Can't feel it yet.

34:14.750 --> 34:16.375
- Did you get an IV
or something?

34:16.417 --> 34:17.375
Little alcohol drip?

34:17.417 --> 34:18.417
Look at your face.

34:18.417 --> 34:19.583
Like, "This kid's serious."

34:19.583 --> 34:21.417
- Seriously douchey.

34:23.125 --> 34:26.333
- That was a good one,
dude. Ah!

34:29.250 --> 34:30.250
- You guys almost ready?

34:30.292 --> 34:32.333
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

34:32.375 --> 34:35.083
- Are you ready?
- Freedom!

34:35.083 --> 34:36.708
- Yeah.
- I'm so happy right now.

34:42.208 --> 34:43.917
- What got us through
the last day of the charter

34:43.917 --> 34:45.417
is knowing
that we can just, like,

34:45.458 --> 34:48.083
crack open that first drink
and be like, "Ah!"

34:48.125 --> 34:49.167
Just shower in it.

34:49.208 --> 34:50.708
- All right, you guys.

34:50.750 --> 34:52.292
To an awesome crew,
an awesome first charter,

34:52.333 --> 34:54.125
and to the rest
of the f----ing season.

34:54.125 --> 34:56.125
- Yay!
- Right on!

34:56.125 --> 34:57.458
- Chhhh!

34:57.458 --> 34:58.875
Glug, glug, glug, glug, glug,
glug.

34:58.917 --> 35:00.708
- What did y'all think
of the tip?

35:00.750 --> 35:02.750
- They were super generous,
and it was such a short time.

35:02.792 --> 35:04.458
- For three days,
it's pretty damn good.

35:04.500 --> 35:06.375
- Actually,
they set the bar very high.

35:06.417 --> 35:08.417
- Yeah, they did.
This season's gonna be great.

35:08.458 --> 35:10.375
Like, for you,
it's gonna be awesome.

35:16.458 --> 35:19.125
- If you ever, ever need
anybody just to vent to,

35:19.125 --> 35:20.375
just come talk to me.

35:20.417 --> 35:22.042
- Got it. Thank you.

35:22.083 --> 35:24.125
- Kelsey's beautiful.
She's stunning.

35:24.167 --> 35:26.458
But she's not here,
whereas Emily's cute.

35:26.458 --> 35:28.542
She's got an amazing accent,

35:28.583 --> 35:29.792
and she's here.

35:33.333 --> 35:35.250
- Can I get a Long Island,
please?

35:35.292 --> 35:39.500
- Lentil rice
and the pan-sued solmon...

35:42.167 --> 35:43.625
- Ben, order for us.

35:43.667 --> 35:45.583
- Can we get one of everything
apart from--

35:45.625 --> 35:47.333
- First order is jerky.

35:47.375 --> 35:49.333
- Just to start,
get the ball rolling.

35:56.458 --> 35:57.750
- I want to get next round.

35:57.792 --> 35:59.583
- I'm doing fine,
thank you.

36:00.833 --> 36:03.250
- Taste mine.
Taste mine.

36:05.292 --> 36:06.583
- No.

36:08.625 --> 36:10.917
- Trevor is looking to go
a lot harder

36:10.958 --> 36:12.500
than everyone else wants to.

36:12.500 --> 36:14.458
- I'll take another Long Island,
please.

36:14.500 --> 36:16.292
- He just strikes me
as the type

36:16.333 --> 36:18.333
that could get out of control.

36:18.375 --> 36:21.375
- Sierra, you have
the f---ing smile of a god.

36:21.375 --> 36:24.208
You have the attitude
and personality of a god.

36:24.208 --> 36:25.375
If I could combine you two...

36:25.417 --> 36:27.208
My God.

36:27.250 --> 36:30.042
- I'm just an asshole.
Don't mind me.

36:30.042 --> 36:31.875
Everybody hates me here.

36:31.875 --> 36:33.125
- I'm gonna get a drink.

36:33.167 --> 36:34.208
- Yeah, let's get one.

36:34.208 --> 36:35.542
- Get me a Long Island.

36:35.583 --> 36:36.708
- Okay.

36:43.542 --> 36:44.792
- The first charter,

36:44.833 --> 36:46.458
a little bit of sh--
hit the fan,

36:46.500 --> 36:48.208
but I just want to push
forward, forget it,

36:48.250 --> 36:50.125
and let's go let our hair down.

36:50.167 --> 36:51.792
I'm getting everybody shots.

36:51.833 --> 36:54.167
- I'm good.
- It's not fun if you do that.

36:54.208 --> 36:55.833
Ben, would you take a shot?
- No.

36:55.875 --> 36:57.542
I'm shotted.

36:57.583 --> 36:59.375
- I mean, I would rather
go back to the boat.

36:59.417 --> 37:02.208
- Oh, can we go back?
Please.

37:02.250 --> 37:04.208
- Liquor, wi-fi...
- Let's go!

37:04.250 --> 37:06.875
- F--- this bullsh--.
No one's gonna just sit here.

37:06.917 --> 37:08.208
Are you gonna dance?

37:08.250 --> 37:09.542
- What?
- Are you gonna dance?

37:09.583 --> 37:11.042
- Yeah, man.

37:22.875 --> 37:25.417
- You all ready?
Where's the truck?

37:25.417 --> 37:27.208
- I'm gonna get more twisted
than all you guys,

37:27.250 --> 37:28.750
and you guys are gonna be like,
"Wow, Trevor can handle

37:28.750 --> 37:30.250
a lot of liquor."

37:30.250 --> 37:31.583
In the morning,
I'm gonna be like...

37:31.583 --> 37:33.208
- We're gonna go back.

37:33.250 --> 37:34.417
- Don't make me stare
at your boobs anymore.

37:34.458 --> 37:36.333
- Oh, my God, really?

37:36.375 --> 37:38.583
- You ready?
- It's f---ing bullsh--.

37:38.583 --> 37:39.792
- Dude, you need to calm down.

37:39.833 --> 37:41.625
Chill, bro, chill.

37:41.667 --> 37:42.792
- F---ing kidding me?

37:42.792 --> 37:43.875
- It's our first night out.

37:43.917 --> 37:45.125
We need to be responsible.

37:45.167 --> 37:46.542
- It's not my style.

37:46.583 --> 37:47.792
We're making
a sh-- ton of money.

37:47.792 --> 37:49.292
We're having fun.

37:49.292 --> 37:50.792
And yeah,
we're going back early,

37:50.792 --> 37:52.292
but we're gonna kick it
in the hot tub, man.

37:52.292 --> 37:53.792
F---.
- Oh, are we?

37:53.792 --> 37:55.125
- Yeah, I'm not going
to bed right now.

37:55.125 --> 37:56.917
- Okay, 'cause I thought
the whole crew

37:56.958 --> 37:58.917
was ready to go to bed,
'cause everybody wouldn't dance.

37:58.958 --> 38:00.750
I've never been
on a charter yacht

38:00.792 --> 38:03.375
that everybody was this f---ing
blatant stagnant mother----er.

38:03.417 --> 38:05.875
- What a f---ing twat.
- Please trust me.

38:05.917 --> 38:07.250
- It'll be good.
I do trust you.

38:07.292 --> 38:09.292
I'm just saying
I can't have--

38:09.292 --> 38:12.750
You don't understand how
f---ing undermined I feel.

38:12.792 --> 38:15.542
I mean, I feel super,
like...pfft.

38:15.583 --> 38:17.042
Like, dude,
I'm just not that--

38:18.458 --> 38:20.458
- Your deckhands know
everything.

38:20.500 --> 38:22.500
You're treating them like
they're greenies, though.

38:22.500 --> 38:24.167
- No, I'm not.
- You are.

38:24.208 --> 38:25.500
How you speak to them
on deck, I've heard you.

38:25.500 --> 38:26.667
You should be guiding them.

38:26.708 --> 38:28.500
You shouldn't be
bossing them around.

38:28.500 --> 38:29.667
I don't boss them around,
and I'm the boatswain.

38:29.667 --> 38:31.500
- You've got to understand

38:31.542 --> 38:32.917
that they're undermining me
when you're gone.

38:32.958 --> 38:34.500
- F--- that, man.
F--- that.

38:34.542 --> 38:36.125
- Right? It's so rude.
- No, he's a twat.

38:36.167 --> 38:37.833
- Look, let's talk
about this in the morning.

38:37.875 --> 38:39.167
I want to go
get in the hot tub.

38:39.167 --> 38:40.500
- Let's talk about it.
Talk about it.

38:40.542 --> 38:42.167
- Not, like,
after you've been drinking.

38:42.167 --> 38:43.833
You need to be able
to bring it to me sober...

38:43.875 --> 38:45.417
- Okay.
- With the facts...

38:45.458 --> 38:47.250
- I'm talking about
I'm being undermined.

38:47.292 --> 38:49.500
Okay, this is not alcohol.
F--- that sh--.

38:49.500 --> 38:50.833
Don't f---ing bring that up.

38:50.833 --> 38:52.000
- Why can't he
just let it go?

38:52.000 --> 38:53.500
If he just chills out...

38:53.542 --> 38:54.958
- All right, I'm heading in.

38:58.875 --> 39:00.000
- F---.

39:03.583 --> 39:06.958
- I'm gonna go grab
board shorts.

39:07.000 --> 39:08.708
This is my night off.

39:08.708 --> 39:10.792
I just want to jump
in the Jacuzzi

39:10.833 --> 39:12.083
and relax.

39:14.375 --> 39:16.500
- Where you going?
Where you going?

39:18.917 --> 39:22.292
- No, I will come back up.

39:25.583 --> 39:27.542
- Who's all up there?
- It's the deck crew.

39:27.542 --> 39:29.542
You should come too,
'cause there's heaps of tension,

39:29.542 --> 39:31.000
and it's really awkward.

39:31.042 --> 39:33.917
- I can't wait.
Let me get on my bikini, okay?

39:35.542 --> 39:37.458
- I was, like, 14.

39:40.375 --> 39:41.708
- What?

39:41.708 --> 39:43.208
Just shut your mouth.

39:43.208 --> 39:44.667
- I'm being honest, dude.

39:44.708 --> 39:47.917
- I'm sitting in a Jacuzzi
on a Sunday

39:47.958 --> 39:51.250
in some dude's basement
when I was 14 years old.

39:51.250 --> 39:53.333
What does some 14-year-old
or 15-year-old kid

39:53.375 --> 39:54.750
you're talking about...

39:55.958 --> 39:57.250
F---. I'm right.

39:57.292 --> 39:58.583
- You weren't being
undermined.

39:58.583 --> 40:00.167
That was just
f---ing plain rude, bro.

40:02.417 --> 40:04.750
- How do you expect
to lead anybody

40:04.750 --> 40:06.417
if you're that disrespectful?

40:06.417 --> 40:07.667
- I'm gonna go to bed now.

40:07.708 --> 40:09.000
No, I'm not dealing with this.

40:09.042 --> 40:10.708
I don't want to hear it.

40:10.750 --> 40:12.000
- Why are you taking it
so harsh, though?

40:12.042 --> 40:13.542
- Because it's sh--.

40:13.583 --> 40:15.375
- Why don't you keep
your opinion to yourself?

40:15.417 --> 40:17.375
'Cause I don't care how
you think about my shading.

40:17.417 --> 40:19.417
- Okay, hey.
Take him down.

40:19.458 --> 40:21.583
- Good job, senior deckhand.
- Hey, hey.

40:21.625 --> 40:23.667
- I'm not talking sh--
about you, bro.

40:23.708 --> 40:25.042
- F---.

40:25.083 --> 40:26.458
- Do you have two brain cells?

40:26.458 --> 40:27.792
Or do you just have one

40:27.792 --> 40:29.417
rubbing up on the side
of your head?

40:29.458 --> 40:30.958
That right there
was the perfect example

40:30.958 --> 40:32.583
of what's wrong
with your leadership.

40:32.625 --> 40:34.125
You don't respect anybody.

40:34.125 --> 40:35.792
- That's not true.
- That is.

40:35.792 --> 40:37.625
Anybody below you,
you don't respect.

40:37.625 --> 40:38.792
I want you to go down
and go to bed.

40:38.833 --> 40:40.125
Go.
We'll talk in the morning.

40:40.167 --> 40:41.583
- You're saying--
- No, no.

40:41.625 --> 40:43.042
I'm done
with this conversation.

40:43.083 --> 40:44.625
Go down. Legit order.
Go to bed. Go.

40:44.667 --> 40:45.917
- Holy f---.

40:49.500 --> 40:51.292
- No, no, I'm done

40:49.833 --> 40:51.292
with this conversation.

40:51.375 --> 40:52.000
Go down. Legit order.

40:51.792 --> 40:52.000
Go to bed. Go.

40:53.917 --> 40:55.625
- Holy f---.

40:55.625 --> 40:57.583
Sure enough, Kelley has to
blow it out of proportion.

40:57.625 --> 40:58.958
He thinks he should step in

40:58.958 --> 41:00.542
and be some type of
father figure.

41:00.583 --> 41:01.625
Like, I don't care
who you are.

41:01.625 --> 41:03.250
You're not gonna do that,

41:03.292 --> 41:05.292
'cause my dad's my dad,
and you're not it.

41:05.292 --> 41:06.917
- The amount of times
he's said sh--,

41:07.000 --> 41:08.833
like, he's literally
digging himself a hole.

41:08.833 --> 41:11.917
- Who?
Oh, Trevor.

41:11.958 --> 41:13.750
- He's being a dick.

41:13.792 --> 41:15.125
He's like, "Oh,
so where's your tattoo from?

41:15.167 --> 41:16.833
Oh, it looks like sh--."

41:16.833 --> 41:18.667
- I really actually like
your tattoo.

41:18.708 --> 41:20.000
I was gonna say that.
- Something's got to be done

41:20.000 --> 41:21.958
with whatever the f---'s
going on.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.083
- It's negative.
- Right.

41:26.125 --> 41:28.833
- He always takes it
to a negative tone, always.

41:28.875 --> 41:30.292
- All I'm thinking is,

41:30.333 --> 41:32.000
"I got to go back to my cabin,

41:32.042 --> 41:34.625
and he's rooming with me."

41:34.667 --> 41:35.917
- Nico, I'd prefer
if you slept

41:35.958 --> 41:37.792
in the guest room.

41:37.833 --> 41:39.000
Sleep in one of them,
please.

41:43.167 --> 41:44.958
- I need to get some space
right now.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.458
I can't be around this guy.

41:47.500 --> 41:49.000
- Nico.

41:50.875 --> 41:52.875
- It's not worth it.
I don't know what's going on.

41:52.875 --> 41:54.875
I really don't,
'cause I wasn't there.

41:54.875 --> 41:58.042
It doesn't matter.
- I just want you to go to bed.

41:58.083 --> 41:59.708
I told you no,
we'd talk in the morning...

41:59.708 --> 42:02.375
- F---.
- Once we've all calmed down,

42:02.375 --> 42:03.625
so I want you to go to bed.

42:03.667 --> 42:04.875
Dude, go to bed.

42:04.875 --> 42:06.708
It's not that hard.
Go to bed.

42:10.875 --> 42:12.375
- So just go to bed.

42:12.375 --> 42:14.792
- I'm going to bed.
- All right, good.

42:14.833 --> 42:17.208
- This is a yacht
and we work together,

42:17.208 --> 42:18.917
and we got to figure this out.

42:21.708 --> 42:23.667
Or sh--'s hitting the fan soon.

42:25.542 --> 42:27.625
- It's either him or me.
That's it.

42:30.875 --> 42:32.375
- Next time on "Below Deck"...

42:32.417 --> 42:35.250
- We have some yachtees,
and then we have Scupper.

42:35.250 --> 42:37.167
- He has a tuxedo.
- Oh.

42:37.208 --> 42:38.917
- I'm prepping dog food
right now.

42:38.958 --> 42:40.167
Please don't disturb.

42:41.750 --> 42:43.750
- Could we push dinner to 9:00?
- Yes, of course.

42:43.750 --> 42:45.750
- When people don't listen
to me, this is what happens.

42:45.750 --> 42:47.083
I just want to make sure

42:47.125 --> 42:48.417
that's clear.
- Okay, great, yeah.

42:48.458 --> 42:50.083
I don't know
what your problem is.

42:50.125 --> 42:51.917
You don't know what
communication is.

42:51.917 --> 42:53.333
- Well, that was the problem,
wasn't it?

42:53.375 --> 42:55.042
- Last night is unacceptable.

42:55.083 --> 42:57.333
If I see anything happen,
I will personally have you gone.

42:57.375 --> 42:58.750
- What, you think
you're f---ing special?

42:58.750 --> 43:00.417
- You're the only problem
that I have.

43:00.417 --> 43:02.333
- I can cheers one with you
if it's the last night.

43:02.375 --> 43:03.917
- This is a total no-no.

43:03.917 --> 43:06.833
- What's one shot
gonna do to a guy like me?

43:06.875 --> 43:08.583
Oh, sh--.

43:08.583 --> 43:10.833
- Know what?

43:10.875 --> 43:12.917
You're done with that.

43:12.958 --> 43:15.958
