00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
[ Laughter ]

00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
What's got Joe dealing under the table?

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
Sal: Oh, Joey!

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
And which losing Joker will be crashing computers

00:22.000 --> 00:23.000
in tonight's punishment?

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
Sal: Prepare for something amazing.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
I take that money!

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
Today, we're at Pace University working with

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
HeyTutor to get one-on-one computer lessons.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
While being taught, we've got to do and say

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
what the other guys tell us.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
If you refuse to do or say anything you're told, you lose.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
I'm excited that we'll actually learn something today.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
That's not gonna happen.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
[ Laughs ]

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Sal, this is Juan.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Juan? Hey. Sal.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
"Mr. Juan." You have to say "mister"

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
before his name every time.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Nice to meet you, Mr. Juan.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Nice to meet you.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
So, what are you working on?

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
I'm deciding that I might be taking some real estate

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
courses next semester. Okay.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
And I just wanted, like, a introduction to --

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
to PowerPoint.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
If I'm being honest, Mr. Juan,

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
I have no clue about anything. That's okay.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
That's great. Just call me Juan.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
No "mister." No "mister."

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Just Juan. Okay, just Juan.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
Yes. Okay.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
"Now, what's the difference between PowerPoint and e-mail?"

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
Okay. And Mr. -- oh, Juan. Yes.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
What is the difference between, let's say, PowerPoint...

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
Mm-hmm. ...and e-mail?

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
Um, well the difference is presentation.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
If you want to, for example, you want a quick presentation...

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
-This guy's the best. -Yeah.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
So we're gonna create a PowerPoint presentation,

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
very simple.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
"Let me do it!"

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
So you can choose from -- Let me do it!

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
Yeah, great.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
Right here, you select the box.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
"Click to add a tit-le?"

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
And then it's just click to add a tit-le

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
or click to add a sub-tit-le, and that's it.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
Always, yes.

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
"People love bigger tit-les, right?"

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
Should it be all caps?

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
Ah, that's up to you. It's your own style.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
Okay. Well, I like a big healthy tit-le, so.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Yeah.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
[ Laughter ]

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
And then since this is your presentation,

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
then you're gonna add your name here.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
Sal, when he points out things on the screen,

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
circle it with a marker.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
Like, you could put your major -- anything you like.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
And then this -- this here is what everyone's gonna see,

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
and then right here in this area here

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
is where I'm gonna add if my name is Sal.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
-There you go. -If I have a --

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
I'm a student at Pace. There you go.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
And then the date. Yes.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
Shake the screen like an Etch A Sketch

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
to make it go away.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
Uh, I don't know. My niece does it like that.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
Oh. [ Laughs ]

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000

-Oh! -Oh, my God!

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
-There you go! -There it is.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
Oh, that was crazy.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
Uh, do you remember how to create a new slide?

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
Yes. Okay.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
"I can't wait to sell houses to rich assholes."

There you go, okay.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
I can't wait to sell houses to rich assholes.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
And, you know, take their money.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
I know. "White mother[bleep]"

03:14.000 --> 03:21.000
These -- These white mother[bleep]

God bless, God bless. Yeah.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
I'll sell houses to anybody.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
"I'll sell houses to [bleep] Martians, I don't care."

"Green -- Green mother[bleep]"

I don't care, those green mother[bleep]

"Outer-space sons of bitches!"

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
Outer-space sons of bitches.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
I know. "Body-snatching bastards!"

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
Those body-snatching, probing bastards.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
"I take that money!"

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
I take that [bleep] money, Mr. Juan!

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
[ Laughter ]

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
All right. Um, so, I think next since

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
we did this page... Yeah.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
...how 'bout "Top Websites to Visit"?

[ Buzzer ]

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
Joe: Here we go.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Um, so, what -- basically, I want to learn

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
how to use PowerPoint. Okay.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
You want everything to be really jazzy.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
I'm looking for, like, a template

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
that's like, super jazzy and just,

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
like, really jumps out at you, you know?

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
Joe: "Whoa, jazz alert!"

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
Wow! Jazz alert, right there!

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
That's super jazzy, right?

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
Murr, you get him to say "jazzy."

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
Isn't that jazzy?

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
What is that, this -- I think the pattern gets you.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
It's super -- right? It's super --

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Eye-catching, man.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
[ Laughter ]

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
All right. So, when you open it up,

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
it'll automatically take you to a title slide.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
Mm-hmm. "Do you have Adderall?"

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
So we just click on the box itself.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
This stuff takes a lot of focus.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
It can be tedious. But once you get it going --

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Do you have Adderall?

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
No, okay.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
Yeah. So, I mean, if you want name

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
any kind of presentation, you're gonna --

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
Oh, so you just type it right into the box.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
Yeah, if you're gonna work on a specific one.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
We decided we're gonna make you do a presentation

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
on your grandma, buddy.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
Um, I want to design a presentation

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
specifically about my grandmother.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
Okay.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
Um, so, I'll make the title, uh --

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
"Percocet"?

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
"My Nana Is the Best."

No.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
So now I have photos, for example.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
There's Grandma.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
It's the same coat, Murr!

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
Joe: It looks like he's wearing the coat!

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
Q: Oh, my God, Murr.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
See, this is actually her -- Is that her coat?

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
Yeah, it's the coat from the photo.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Oh, nice. Isn't that great?

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
"She think just 'cause I borrow her underwear

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
she can wear my jackets."

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
I mean, you know, she thinks she can wear my jackets

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
just 'cause I borrow her bloomers.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
It's not the same.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
32 years old, and I'm gonna get yelled at by Grandma?

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
What is there -- What does that thing do up there?

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
That's the rotation.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
Joe: Put Grandma upside-down. Put Grandma upside-down.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
Flip her upside-down. That's hysterical.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
"She's on her way out, anyway."

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
Yeah, flip her upside-down. She's on her way out, anyway.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
You know.

I'm doing pretty good. I'm getting it.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000

Okay, so, now -- Now, if I wanted to insert

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
another slide, what else can I do?

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
So, what else could I do?

see him again.

I can't believe this. Where is the bathroom?
