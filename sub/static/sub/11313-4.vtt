WEBVTT

00:10.144 --> 00:13.312
My head hurts <i> so</i> bad!

00:13.314 --> 00:14.913
There was a female figure.

00:14.915 --> 00:17.249
She was hitting me.

00:17.251 --> 00:19.818
She does attacks in here.

00:19.820 --> 00:20.953
This is one of
the worst stories

00:20.955 --> 00:22.821
I've ever heard
about a guy's life.

00:22.823 --> 00:26.592
Get it away.
Get it away from me now.

00:26.594 --> 00:29.528
I'm overwhelmed.
I need answers.

00:29.530 --> 00:33.065
This is my room.
Get the **** out.

00:33.067 --> 00:36.201
He's a problem.
He's a problem.

00:37.571 --> 00:38.904
I just hear death.

00:38.906 --> 00:41.206
My name is Amy Allan.

00:41.208 --> 00:42.741
God.

00:42.743 --> 00:44.810
He was like,
"I'm going to get you."

00:44.812 --> 00:45.944
I see dead people.

00:45.946 --> 00:47.179
Her face was all demonic.

00:47.181 --> 00:48.981
I speak to dead people...

00:48.983 --> 00:51.717
He's like, "You think you can
stop me? Because you can't."

00:51.719 --> 00:53.118
...and they speak to me.

00:53.120 --> 00:54.653
- What is he trying to do?
- Kill them.

00:54.655 --> 00:57.790
But there's only one way
to know if my findings are real.

00:57.792 --> 00:59.792
Something happened.
Bam, bam, bam.

00:59.794 --> 01:01.293
I rely on my partner.

01:01.295 --> 01:02.928
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:02.930 --> 01:04.663
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

01:04.665 --> 01:06.165
Am I seeing
what I think I'm seeing?

01:06.167 --> 01:09.735
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:09.737 --> 01:11.937
- They're everywhere.
- It's my job to reveal them.

01:11.939 --> 01:14.840
This guy's got the markings
of a serial killer.

01:14.842 --> 01:16.809
But Steve and I never speak...

01:16.811 --> 01:18.877
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:18.879 --> 01:20.079
...until the very end.

01:20.081 --> 01:21.680
Is this dead guy
doin' that to her?

01:21.682 --> 01:23.849
When we uncover if it's safe
for you to stay...

01:23.851 --> 01:25.584
That's it.

01:25.586 --> 01:27.753
Or time to get out.

01:27.755 --> 01:31.223
Somebody is gonna die
over there soon. Yeah.

01:33.000 --> 01:39.074

01:45.706 --> 01:48.373
I'm out here in the small town
of St. Charles, Michigan.

01:48.375 --> 01:51.477
It's about 45 minutes northwest
of Flint.

01:51.479 --> 01:53.178
I got a frantic call
from a woman

01:53.180 --> 01:56.415
who says she and her daughter
are under attack.

01:56.417 --> 01:58.884
They're both scared
for their lives, and they said,

01:58.886 --> 02:00.953
"If we don't get there fast,
somebody's gonna get hurt."

02:06.861 --> 02:09.261
Before Amy arrives,
I clear the area

02:09.263 --> 02:12.998
of anything that could influence
her findings.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.833
This home is filled
with family photos,

02:14.835 --> 02:18.670
so it's important that I cover
or remove them all.

02:18.672 --> 02:22.107
When I'm done, the location will
be ready for tonight's walk.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.254
There's something about, like,

02:35.256 --> 02:39.458
this male that lived here.

02:39.460 --> 02:40.726
He had a family.

02:40.728 --> 02:46.498
He has this strange idea

02:46.500 --> 02:50.035
that him and his family
were cursed.

02:50.037 --> 02:53.739
And he's saying that
because of the curse,

02:53.741 --> 02:56.108
everybody died.

02:56.110 --> 02:58.577
He's a problem.
He's a problem.

03:05.319 --> 03:07.052
When we spoke on the phone,

03:07.054 --> 03:11.757
the only word that can describe
how you sounded was pure panic.

03:11.759 --> 03:13.825
Yeah.
It's like a pressure cooker.

03:13.827 --> 03:16.929
Like, everything's falling to
a head And it's gonna explode.

03:16.931 --> 03:18.664
I mean, that's how I feel
in the house.

03:18.666 --> 03:20.299
Okay. So what's goin' on?

03:20.301 --> 03:22.501
We hear banging and knocking,

03:22.503 --> 03:24.670
screams, voices,

03:24.672 --> 03:27.673
things being thrown,
and now physical attacks.

03:30.644 --> 03:35.514
My daughter, Kaleigh,
has woken up with scratches.

03:35.516 --> 03:37.816
Um, her health
is pretty bad.

03:37.818 --> 03:38.617
What's she dealin' with?

03:38.619 --> 03:40.118
with?

03:40.120 --> 03:43.388
Stomach migraines
and a racing heart.

03:43.390 --> 03:45.591
Okay.
How old is Kaleigh now?

03:45.593 --> 03:47.092
-20.
-20.

03:47.094 --> 03:50.229
And she won't
stay in here by herself.

03:50.231 --> 03:53.432
Okay. Now who's
living here right now?

03:53.434 --> 03:54.633
Me and my daughter.

03:54.635 --> 03:56.768
My husband, he's overseas.

03:56.770 --> 03:59.037
And he comes back
in 18 months.

03:59.039 --> 04:00.405
What's he doin' over there?

04:00.407 --> 04:02.574
Construction in Africa.

04:02.576 --> 04:05.077
When exactly did you guys,
move in here?

04:05.079 --> 04:06.245
2002.

04:06.247 --> 04:08.313
When the activities start?

04:08.315 --> 04:10.515
Immediately,
but it was small.

04:10.517 --> 04:11.883
When did it get violent?

04:11.885 --> 04:15.454
2013, after Mike's mom
passed away.

04:15.456 --> 04:17.221
She had cancer.

04:17.224 --> 04:19.757
We have her ashes.

04:19.760 --> 04:20.959
Where? Here in the house?

04:20.961 --> 04:23.562
- Yes. I...
- You're kiddin' me.

04:30.704 --> 04:32.271
What can you tell me
about your mother-in-law?

04:32.273 --> 04:34.640
Um, she was 65
when she died.

04:34.642 --> 04:37.042
- Okay.
- Her name was Ruth.

04:37.044 --> 04:39.778
And those are
some pictures of her.

04:39.780 --> 04:42.381
How was Mike's relationship
with his mom?
Bad.

04:42.383 --> 04:44.116
- It was bad?
- It was bad.

04:44.118 --> 04:46.551
She was
a very controlling woman.

04:53.360 --> 04:55.627
You all right?

04:55.629 --> 05:00.565
She brought men home
in front of Mike.

05:00.567 --> 05:02.401
I know there was infidelity.

05:02.403 --> 05:03.602
So let me get this
straight...

05:03.604 --> 05:06.138
While Mike's mother
and father were married?

05:07.641 --> 05:09.374
So how did he deal
with it?

05:09.376 --> 05:12.144
From what I gather,
at the time that he was 16,

05:12.146 --> 05:14.746
he quit talking for a year.

05:14.748 --> 05:16.381
Quit talking to her
or just quit talking?

05:16.383 --> 05:18.283
Quit talking.

05:18.285 --> 05:19.818
This looks like
it upsets you.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.053
It does.

05:21.055 --> 05:23.422
Yeah.
Here, take those.

05:28.162 --> 05:33.565
I don't think a child
should have to go through that.

05:37.371 --> 05:40.639
When we got together,
she didn't like me.

05:40.641 --> 05:41.673
Do you know why?

05:41.675 --> 05:44.409
I was 26
when I ended up pregnant.

05:44.411 --> 05:47.713
When we told her that I was
pregnant, she's like,

05:47.715 --> 05:49.981
"Well, I thought you weren't
that type of girl."

05:52.052 --> 05:53.985
She wasn't a nice lady.

06:01.195 --> 06:03.061
So there's this dead lady.

06:05.733 --> 06:08.166
She gives a creepy vibe.
I don't like her.

06:08.168 --> 06:11.169
She's, like, young mentally.

06:11.171 --> 06:12.671
She's a pretty girl.

06:12.673 --> 06:14.339
She was disgraceful.

06:14.341 --> 06:16.842
I think that she might have been
married a few times.

06:16.844 --> 06:19.644
Something about babies.
I don't know.

06:19.646 --> 06:21.113
And I don't even know
who the ****

06:21.115 --> 06:22.948
she was with to have the babies.
Like, you know what I'm sayin'?

06:22.950 --> 06:25.150
Like, these other men...

06:25.152 --> 06:28.453
She's creeping me out.
She's creeping me out.

06:37.398 --> 06:39.464
Okay, so why'd you bring
me into the kitchen?

06:39.466 --> 06:40.832
One day,
I was doin' the dishes...
Okay.

06:40.834 --> 06:43.001
...and a box of tea bags
came flyin' at me

06:43.003 --> 06:45.670
and almost hit me,
landed behind my feet.

06:45.672 --> 06:47.272
- A box like that?
- Yes.

06:47.274 --> 06:49.441
Okay, so what you're tellin' me
is it was up here?

06:49.443 --> 06:53.812
Yes. Laying flat, yes.

06:53.814 --> 06:56.748
- All right, so...

06:56.750 --> 06:59.384
Me flingin' it a little bit,
it only lands here.

06:59.386 --> 07:00.719
- Yes.
- All right.

07:00.721 --> 07:02.854
Well, you got a main road
out here. Trucks go by a lot.

07:02.856 --> 07:04.256
I saw when I was comin' up.

07:04.258 --> 07:06.324
Right, but that won't make
a box of tea bags fall off.

07:06.326 --> 07:08.660
- Well, not to where you were.
- No.

07:08.662 --> 07:10.896
Okay. Anything else
in the kitchen?

07:10.898 --> 07:14.132
I always have the unnerving
feeling of being watched.

07:14.134 --> 07:16.368
- You feelin' it right now?
- Yeah.

07:16.370 --> 07:18.036
Where you feelin'
it's comin' from?

07:18.038 --> 07:21.239
Like, right here,
like I'm in its space.

07:21.241 --> 07:23.375
Interesting.

07:23.377 --> 07:25.343
All right, anything else?

07:25.345 --> 07:27.813
I hear a woman's voice
saying, "Where's Mike?"

07:27.815 --> 07:30.315
- "Where's Mike?"
- "Where's Mike?"

07:30.317 --> 07:32.150
All right.
The obvious question is,

07:32.152 --> 07:34.219
did it sound like
your mother-in-law?

07:34.221 --> 07:37.656
Yeah.

07:37.658 --> 07:40.091
You got some strange
stuff goin' on.

07:40.093 --> 07:41.293
- Yeah.
- You okay?

07:41.295 --> 07:43.728
Yeah.

07:43.730 --> 07:45.497
It's a lot.

07:49.736 --> 07:52.337
The dead lady,

07:52.339 --> 07:55.674
she's, like, um,
a creeper, man.

07:55.676 --> 07:57.476
She gets creepy
up on the back of you.

07:57.478 --> 07:59.744
So then your --
your hair goes up.

07:59.746 --> 08:01.546
She just smothers everybody.

08:01.548 --> 08:03.615
She just starts screaming
and being weird.

08:06.887 --> 08:10.689
<i> What</i> the ****?

08:12.659 --> 08:16.127
Really likes this room, a lot.

08:16.129 --> 08:18.964
She -- she very much likes
the closets.

08:21.502 --> 08:27.372
I saw her, like,
throwing shoes or something.

08:34.481 --> 08:36.581
Okay, so what's goin' on
in here?

08:36.582 --> 08:40.352
I've been wakin' up
with bruises,

08:40.354 --> 08:43.788
I just started
noticing them, like fingers.

08:43.789 --> 08:45.624
- Just recently?
- Yes.

08:45.626 --> 08:46.958
Have you had
any blood work done

08:46.960 --> 08:48.894
to see if you have
any immune system problems?

08:48.896 --> 08:51.096
Nothing's wrong.

08:51.098 --> 08:52.964
Okay.

08:52.966 --> 08:55.233
So this seems like a pretty
terrifying room for you.

08:55.235 --> 08:57.702
Yeah.
Um, this morning,

08:57.704 --> 08:59.604
at 4:00 in the morning,
woke up,

08:59.606 --> 09:02.474
and there was a female figure,
saw the outline.

09:02.476 --> 09:04.543
She was hitting me.

09:04.545 --> 09:06.811
Who'd the female
look like to you?

09:06.813 --> 09:09.347
Short hair. I mean,
the outline was short hair.

09:09.349 --> 09:10.782
Do you think
it's your mother-in-law?

09:10.784 --> 09:12.684
Yeah.

09:12.686 --> 09:15.186
But I don't wanna say
that it was her.

09:15.188 --> 09:17.756
Why would she slap me?

09:17.758 --> 09:19.724
- Well, she didn't like you.
- I know.

09:22.396 --> 09:25.096
You okay? Okay.

09:25.098 --> 09:29.467
To see something
coming at me to hit me...

09:29.469 --> 09:32.103
I don't know
how to explain it.

09:32.105 --> 09:34.005
What do you think's
goin' on here?

09:34.007 --> 09:36.541
I think
I made somebody angry.

09:36.543 --> 09:38.076
Why do you say that,
sweetie?

09:38.078 --> 09:40.412
Possibly angry
because Mike's overseas,

09:40.414 --> 09:43.014
and she didn't want him
to go.

09:43.016 --> 09:44.382
And who are you gonna tell?

09:44.384 --> 09:47.452
I mean, people are gonna
think I'm crazy.

09:47.454 --> 09:49.921
I don't think you're crazy.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.156
All right?

09:52.326 --> 09:54.793
All right. It's okay.

09:56.296 --> 09:59.831
Somebody yelling in here,
"Don't be a stupid ****!

09:59.833 --> 10:02.734
Don't be a stupid ****!"

10:02.736 --> 10:05.270
It seems like

10:05.272 --> 10:08.373
she does attacks in here.

10:08.375 --> 10:10.041
What does she do?

10:10.043 --> 10:13.979
Very slowly opening the door...

10:13.981 --> 10:15.313
then she'll rush.

10:19.753 --> 10:24.589
I feel like the living people
feel her open, open, open, open

10:24.591 --> 10:26.758
and then attacking.

10:26.760 --> 10:28.627
It's really bad in here.

10:28.629 --> 10:30.528
I guess this is her space.

10:30.530 --> 10:33.031
Like, I think
she's claimed this room.

10:33.033 --> 10:34.232
It's, like, direct.

10:34.234 --> 10:36.501
"This is my room.
Get the **** out."

10:57.791 --> 10:59.024
So, Kaleigh, I had

10:59.026 --> 11:01.359
a pretty emotional,
discussion with your mom.

11:01.361 --> 11:03.495
Are you worried about her?
- Yeah.

11:03.497 --> 11:05.130
What about Dad bein' away?

11:05.132 --> 11:06.464
I don't like that he's gone.

11:06.466 --> 11:09.768
But, I mean,
it's also kind of nice

11:09.770 --> 11:13.705
because we don't have
to walk on eggshells.

11:13.707 --> 11:15.106
What do you mean by
"eggshells"?

11:15.108 --> 11:19.010
He gets really mean
when he's in the basement.

11:19.012 --> 11:22.681
But after he's up here
for a while, it's fine.

11:22.683 --> 11:23.882
Interesting.

11:23.884 --> 11:25.917
So, Kaleigh, when I was
talkin' to your mom,

11:25.919 --> 11:29.054
she said the activity
picked up enormously

11:29.056 --> 11:32.557
after your grandmother's ashes
came into the house.

11:32.559 --> 11:34.092
So do you agree with mom

11:34.094 --> 11:36.394
that she may be here
and haunting you guys?

11:36.396 --> 11:39.998
Yeah.
She was just a mean old lady.

11:40.000 --> 11:40.999
Okay.

11:41.001 --> 11:43.835
She treated me like crap.

11:43.837 --> 11:45.937
Okay. So I know you guys
are havin' experiences.

11:45.939 --> 11:47.072
I wanna hear about yours.

11:47.074 --> 11:50.608
I hear knocking
coming from the closet

11:50.610 --> 11:52.610
that's connected
to my bedroom.

11:52.612 --> 11:57.148
Like, you know, like,
almost like something's falling.

11:57.150 --> 11:59.951
But there's nothing in there
that could have fallen.

11:59.953 --> 12:02.887
That's strange.
Anything else?

12:02.889 --> 12:06.024
Um, I sometimes wake up
with scratches on my face.

12:06.026 --> 12:08.026
- On your face?
- Yes.

12:08.028 --> 12:10.962
So the scratches,
how often do you get them?

12:10.964 --> 12:13.398
Maybe
once every couple weeks.

12:13.400 --> 12:16.634
Let me see your fingernails.

12:16.636 --> 12:19.471
Well, it's not your nails.
What about the cats?

12:19.473 --> 12:20.872
The cats
don't come in here.

12:20.874 --> 12:23.541
So, Kaleigh, do you think
you and mom

12:23.543 --> 12:25.477
are in danger in this house?

12:25.479 --> 12:27.946
- I do.
- Okay.

12:30.450 --> 12:32.617
There's, like, a child here.

12:32.619 --> 12:37.388
He has on, like,
overalls, lederhosen.

12:37.390 --> 12:40.492
And there's some relationship
between him

12:40.494 --> 12:43.328
and the guy who thinks
he's cursed.

12:43.330 --> 12:47.465
Some of the things
that he does...

12:47.467 --> 12:49.601
It's terrible. It's terrible.

12:49.603 --> 12:51.803
He touches people.

12:51.805 --> 12:54.773
You know, he touches them.

12:54.775 --> 12:58.176
What he does to other kids,
not good.

12:58.178 --> 13:01.579
The thing with him
with other kids, he'll glom on.

13:01.581 --> 13:03.148
Like, get in them
for a little bit,

13:03.150 --> 13:05.016
just a short period.

13:05.018 --> 13:07.952
How people would see the kids

13:07.954 --> 13:10.655
being influenced
by this dead kid...

13:10.657 --> 13:13.024
Yeah?
...Is that
they would see, like,

13:13.026 --> 13:16.127
the living kid
being, like, spaced out

13:16.129 --> 13:19.030
because they're absorbing
dead energy.

13:19.032 --> 13:20.698
They could have
heart problems.

13:20.700 --> 13:22.901
And the more he does it
and the more the living kids

13:22.903 --> 13:24.903
are exposed to him,
the worse...

13:24.905 --> 13:26.104
You see what I'm sayin'?

13:26.106 --> 13:28.273
It could be bad,
really, really bad.

13:36.216 --> 13:39.050
Lord, what the ****?

13:39.052 --> 13:42.654
Get it away.
Get it away from me now.

13:42.656 --> 13:44.455
What just happened?

13:44.457 --> 13:48.059
Something...impacted my head.

13:48.061 --> 13:50.328
I was talking about the little
boy, and that happened.

13:50.330 --> 13:54.966
My head hurts
so ****<i> bad.</i>

13:54.968 --> 13:57.001
Ooh!

14:03.910 --> 14:05.910
Even though
Mike's halfway across the world,

14:05.912 --> 14:08.680
I need to know what he thinks
is goin' on at home.

14:08.682 --> 14:10.849
So I've arranged a meeting
with him over the Internet

14:10.851 --> 14:12.517
to see what he's got to say.

14:12.519 --> 14:15.119
So, Mike, I understand you're
over in Africa, correct?

14:15.121 --> 14:16.454
<i> -Yes.</i>
- Okay.

14:16.456 --> 14:18.056
I'm gonna be blunt.
Are you -

14:18.058 --> 14:19.824
Do you believe what your wife
and daughter are sayin'?

14:19.826 --> 14:22.126
<i> I believe it</i>
<i> to a certain extent.</i>

14:22.128 --> 14:24.162
Okay. Your wife thinks
when your --

14:24.164 --> 14:26.464
your mom's remains
came into the house,

14:26.466 --> 14:27.498
things changed then.

14:27.500 --> 14:29.400
Do you -- Does that make
any sense to you?

14:29.402 --> 14:30.568
<i> It does.</i>

14:30.570 --> 14:32.337
<i> And I'm beginning to wonder</i>

14:32.339 --> 14:35.540
<i> if we need to do something</i>
<i> sooner than later.</i>

14:35.542 --> 14:37.709
Okay. Talkin' to your wife,
she said that

14:37.711 --> 14:40.178
you and your mom
had a difficult relationship.

14:40.180 --> 14:43.047
<i> Yeah. It wasn't -- </i>
<i> it wasn't very pleasant.</i>

14:43.049 --> 14:46.117
<i> You know, and she was always,</i>
<i>...you know,</i>

14:46.119 --> 14:47.919
<i> trying to get</i>
<i> into everybody's business</i>

14:47.921 --> 14:51.589
<i> and trying to tell them how</i>
<i> to live, and stuff like that.</i>

14:51.591 --> 14:53.258
Okay.

14:58.131 --> 15:01.733
The dead man who thinks
he's cursed likes it down here.

15:01.735 --> 15:03.268
I think that people
get really sad --

15:03.270 --> 15:05.436
really, really sad down here.

15:05.438 --> 15:07.205
There's a living male here.

15:07.207 --> 15:09.674
The male has issues,
big-time issues.

15:09.676 --> 15:12.477
It's, like, emotional ****.
Like, emotional problems.

15:12.479 --> 15:15.580
He comes and goes.
He comes and goes.

15:15.582 --> 15:18.182
I mean, I don't think
he was A-okay to begin with.

15:18.184 --> 15:19.183
You know what I mean?

15:19.185 --> 15:21.052
So he was, like,
a really easy target

15:21.054 --> 15:23.354
for this cursed dead guy.

15:23.356 --> 15:24.622
And what does he do
to him?

15:24.624 --> 15:29.360
He influences him to act angry.

15:32.599 --> 15:35.633
Mike, have you had
any experiences in the house?

15:35.635 --> 15:37.702
<i> I've, you know,</i>
<i> seen, like, shadows</i>

15:37.704 --> 15:39.137
<i> out of the corner of my eye.</i>

15:39.139 --> 15:41.472
<i> You know, I'd be</i>
<i> in my workout room,</i>

15:41.474 --> 15:43.274
<i> and I got some big mirrors</i>
<i> down here.</i>

15:43.276 --> 15:45.410
<i> And -- and it would seem</i>
<i> like I'd see it</i>

15:45.412 --> 15:47.779
<i> out of the corner</i>
<i> of my eye in the mirror.</i>

15:47.781 --> 15:49.981
So how often
were you seein' this?

15:49.983 --> 15:52.617
<i> Maybe once every couple</i>
<i> of weeks or so.</i>

15:52.619 --> 15:55.053
Okay. Anything else?

15:55.055 --> 15:57.855
<i> I've had, like,</i>
<i> a-a breath or something,</i>

15:57.857 --> 16:01.359
<i> like, on my neck when I was,</i>
<i> you know, on the treadmill.</i>

16:01.361 --> 16:02.727
Okay.

16:02.729 --> 16:05.530
Could you figure out if it came
from a vent or anything?

16:05.532 --> 16:08.366
<i> There -- there's not</i>
<i> a vent, right there.</i>

16:08.368 --> 16:10.134
All right. So I don't know
how much of a skeptic you can be

16:10.136 --> 16:12.003
after experiencing
something like that.

16:12.005 --> 16:13.404
<i> Right.</i>

16:16.943 --> 16:19.677
The guy
who thinks he's cursed,

16:19.679 --> 16:22.814
he feels like this is <i> his</i> hell.

16:22.816 --> 16:24.048
But his main focus

16:24.050 --> 16:26.451
is just to get these
living people out of here.

16:26.453 --> 16:30.421
He pushes weird,
emotions on them.

16:30.423 --> 16:33.024
They feel ashamed for no reason.

16:33.026 --> 16:35.093
They feel guilt for no reason.

16:35.095 --> 16:37.228
They feel sad for no reason.

16:37.230 --> 16:40.164
How do you think
prolonged exposure to this guy

16:40.166 --> 16:41.532
would affect the living?

16:41.534 --> 16:46.704
I think that he would drive
the living male insane.

17:00.787 --> 17:02.954
The second I get
to a town, I work the phones --

17:02.956 --> 17:05.957
cops, historians,
local journalists.

17:05.959 --> 17:07.525
I try to see if anyone has
a lead.

17:07.527 --> 17:09.627
I just got a call back
from a genealogist

17:09.628 --> 17:12.230
who says one of
the original owners of the land

17:12.232 --> 17:14.265
has pretty amazing
and tragic story

17:14.267 --> 17:15.867
I'm definitely gonna
wanna hear about.

17:22.809 --> 17:24.041
You had mentioned
on the phone

17:24.044 --> 17:25.410
one of the original owners
of the property

17:25.412 --> 17:28.279
I'm investigating
had a pretty tragic time there.

17:28.281 --> 17:30.314
But before we get to that,
who was this guy?

17:30.316 --> 17:31.682
Well, John Baumler.

17:31.684 --> 17:35.753
He came over from Germany,
immigrated in 1880.

17:35.755 --> 17:37.455
He was 29 years old.

17:37.457 --> 17:40.158
This is John Baumler's
immigration record.

17:40.160 --> 17:42.093
He came with his wife Anna

17:42.095 --> 17:45.296
and two children --
Leonard and Frederica.

17:45.298 --> 17:47.165
Okay. It says here
he's a farmer.

17:47.167 --> 17:50.001
He's a farmer.
Six days after they got here,

17:50.003 --> 17:53.104
their 9-month-old daughter
dies.

17:53.106 --> 17:56.674
And 8 days after that,
their son dies.

17:56.676 --> 17:57.875
My god.

17:57.877 --> 18:00.044
I managed to track down
the death records.

18:00.046 --> 18:02.847
And here they are,
the two children.

18:04.117 --> 18:06.384
Do we know what
they died of?

18:06.386 --> 18:07.552
No.

18:07.554 --> 18:10.021
They may have contracted
something on the boat.

18:10.023 --> 18:11.556
Okay, so at some point,

18:11.558 --> 18:13.124
they make it to St. Charles
with no kids.

18:13.126 --> 18:14.125
Correct.

18:14.127 --> 18:15.126
Do they try to start
a family again?

18:15.128 --> 18:17.195
Yes.
They had two more children.

18:17.197 --> 18:20.198
And then tragedy strikes again
for John Baumler.

18:20.200 --> 18:21.432
What happened?

18:21.434 --> 18:23.768
In 1884, his wife dies.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.636
Do we know why or how?

18:25.638 --> 18:27.572
No, we don't have
the records,

18:27.574 --> 18:30.174
but we think it probably
was childbirth.

18:30.176 --> 18:31.442
Okay.

18:36.216 --> 18:39.283
This cursed guy,
he's very much like,

18:39.285 --> 18:41.919
"I lived here.
I lived here. I died here."

18:41.921 --> 18:45.456
So he...
I don't know how he died.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.592
Do you know what
he did in life?

18:47.594 --> 18:50.795
I believe he was a farmer.

18:50.797 --> 18:55.233
I saw him working with land
and cows and horses and stuff.

18:58.471 --> 19:00.638
Something happened
to his entire family.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.406
He feels responsible.

19:04.777 --> 19:07.111
Already this guy's life
is a sad story.

19:07.113 --> 19:08.880
- Yes.
- Wh-- what happens next?

19:08.882 --> 19:11.215
Well,
over the next 31 years,

19:11.217 --> 19:15.319
he actually marries three times
and loses each of his wives.

19:15.321 --> 19:16.587
What the hell happened?

19:16.589 --> 19:19.657
The next wife,
whose name was Minnie Kutzbach,

19:19.659 --> 19:21.826
she died in 1890.

19:21.828 --> 19:23.828
Okay, so she dies, say it --
what is says here is,

19:23.830 --> 19:26.464
"consumption," which is...
- Tuberculosis.

19:26.466 --> 19:29.934
The next wife's name
was Wilhelmina Wall.

19:29.936 --> 19:31.068
Okay.

19:31.070 --> 19:34.205
She dies in 1913
of an infection

19:34.207 --> 19:39.277
which affects her heart
and her kidneys.

19:39.279 --> 19:41.979
He marries again
in less than a year,

19:41.981 --> 19:43.514
in 1914.

19:43.516 --> 19:44.615
Okay.

19:44.617 --> 19:46.751
And their marriage
was the shortest of all.

19:46.753 --> 19:49.921
And within a year
and a half, she dies.

19:49.923 --> 19:53.925
She is struck and killed
by an automobile.

19:53.927 --> 19:55.960
Okay, I'm almost
even afraid to ask

19:55.962 --> 19:57.395
if this guy
got married again.

19:57.397 --> 19:59.096
Yes, he did, Steve.

19:59.098 --> 20:03.000
In 1918, he marries
a 47-year-old widow

20:03.002 --> 20:06.604
by the name
of Christina Barnekow.

20:06.606 --> 20:08.206
Okay.

20:08.208 --> 20:09.774
And in 1920,

20:09.776 --> 20:11.943
he buys
your client's property.

20:11.945 --> 20:14.345
All right, so they're on
my client's property.

20:14.347 --> 20:15.680
Please tell me it went well
for these guys.

20:15.682 --> 20:17.515
Well, it did for a while.

20:17.517 --> 20:19.217
But in 1929,

20:19.219 --> 20:21.953
John Baumler
was struck and killed

20:21.955 --> 20:24.622
by a hit-and-run driver.

20:24.624 --> 20:26.357
A hit-and-run,
so nobody ever got caught?

20:26.359 --> 20:28.659
No one ever was caught.

20:28.661 --> 20:30.161
This is one of
the worst stories

20:30.163 --> 20:31.662
I've ever heard
about a guy's life.

20:31.664 --> 20:33.164
It was a very tragic life.

20:37.937 --> 20:40.504
I think that a lot
of things went wrong, like,

20:40.506 --> 20:44.475
with his business
and his family.

20:44.477 --> 20:47.578
His whole family dies.

20:47.580 --> 20:50.014
L- like, I feel a wife.

20:50.016 --> 20:53.484
I feel like there were kids.

20:53.486 --> 20:56.621
But I do think

20:56.623 --> 20:58.556
that they died from an illness.

20:58.558 --> 21:01.325
And I think
that he feels responsible.

21:01.327 --> 21:03.127
They got sick
and -- and they died,

21:03.129 --> 21:06.030
and he feels that somehow
he contributed to that.

21:07.767 --> 21:11.068
And then he said
that everybody died.

21:11.070 --> 21:15.473
And so he felt
like he was cursed.

21:15.475 --> 21:18.409
It feels like there's still
a curse here existing,

21:18.411 --> 21:20.044
like it never ceased.

21:23.283 --> 21:25.516
This curse, he thinks
it's like a monster.

21:31.624 --> 21:34.058
If you need us to investigate
unexplained activity

21:34.060 --> 21:35.893
in your home,
go to the "Dead Files" page

21:35.895 --> 21:37.828
at travelchannel.com.

21:37.830 --> 21:39.730
Click on "Help me, Dead Files!"
to submit your story,

21:39.732 --> 21:40.865
and we'll help if we can.

21:49.008 --> 21:50.508
So far, I've got
a mother and daughter

21:50.510 --> 21:51.942
being terrorized on a property

21:51.944 --> 21:54.412
that's had several
tragic deaths.

21:54.414 --> 21:56.013
But I need to see
if there's anything more

21:56.015 --> 21:59.283
that could help
my investigation.

21:59.285 --> 22:01.419
Searchin' through old records,
I find a man

22:01.421 --> 22:03.587
who was crushed to death
right in front of his son.

22:03.589 --> 22:05.323
Turns out it happened
in a coal mine

22:05.325 --> 22:08.092
just a few thousand feet
from my client's property.

22:09.595 --> 22:11.295
So I just spoke
to a mining expert

22:11.297 --> 22:14.699
who says that tragedy
is just the tip of the iceberg.

22:14.701 --> 22:16.033
He says that St. Charles' mines

22:16.035 --> 22:17.601
were nothing less
than deathtraps,

22:17.603 --> 22:19.770
and he's got the headlines
to prove it.

22:25.011 --> 22:27.578
So I came across
that tragic accident

22:27.580 --> 22:29.947
that happened in the mine
right near my client's property.

22:29.949 --> 22:31.649
But before we get to that,

22:31.651 --> 22:34.452
what was mining like
in St. Charles at that time?

22:34.454 --> 22:37.188
Well, it starts
right around 1896, Steve.

22:37.190 --> 22:39.290
Okay.
Um, and it's kind
of an accident in and of itself,

22:39.292 --> 22:40.691
what all that happens.

22:40.693 --> 22:43.627
Um, you got a guy
that's diggin' a water well...

22:43.629 --> 22:44.895
Okay.

22:44.897 --> 22:46.330
...and, he basically hits
a bunch of black rock.

22:46.332 --> 22:48.132
Turns out to be coal.

22:48.134 --> 22:50.334
And,
the next thing you know,

22:50.336 --> 22:52.169
basically you got a little bit
of an economic boom goin' on.

22:52.171 --> 22:53.838
Who would have worked
these mines?

22:53.840 --> 22:56.040
A lot of,
Eastern European immigrants

22:56.042 --> 22:57.308
that came into the area.

22:57.310 --> 22:58.542
And you know,
you gotta remember,

22:58.544 --> 23:00.077
this is before labor laws.

23:00.079 --> 23:03.381
And so you got literally kids
workin' in these mines.

23:04.884 --> 23:06.584
So, T.J., I know
mining's dangerous,

23:06.586 --> 23:07.985
but what were
the conditions like

23:07.987 --> 23:09.453
for the mines
here in St. Charles?

23:09.455 --> 23:11.122
You got cave-ins.

23:11.124 --> 23:12.289
You got,

23:12.291 --> 23:14.225
highly explosive gases
that are down there.

23:14.227 --> 23:16.827
I mean, all you gotta do
is look at pictures like this.

23:16.829 --> 23:19.930
And all you can see there's --
there's the guy's legs.

23:19.932 --> 23:22.133
Jeez.

23:22.135 --> 23:24.001
Okay, so now the accidents
that happen

23:24.003 --> 23:25.903
near my client's property,
what're we talkin' about?

23:25.905 --> 23:27.104
How close was it?

23:27.106 --> 23:29.006
Well, you're lookin' at
less than a 1/2-mile.

23:29.008 --> 23:30.841
I got a map here

23:30.843 --> 23:34.812
that actually shows
the Robert Gage No. 8 mine.

23:34.814 --> 23:37.381
And, your client's
property's right about here.

23:37.383 --> 23:38.682
Okay, almost towards
the end of the mine.

23:38.684 --> 23:40.518
Yeah, exactly.

23:40.520 --> 23:42.453
So when did
this accident happen?

23:42.455 --> 23:44.155
The year was 1901.

23:44.157 --> 23:47.992
And, the victim's name
is Albert Newman.

23:47.994 --> 23:49.927
He and his son,
were working

23:49.929 --> 23:51.729
in one of the rooms
in the mine.

23:51.731 --> 23:53.330
And, he was evidently

23:53.332 --> 23:55.733
testing out the roof
of that room

23:55.735 --> 23:58.035
to, get ready
to drill into it.

23:58.037 --> 23:59.670
Sent his son
out to another room,

23:59.672 --> 24:03.040
and, the son heard what
he thought was water rushing.

24:03.042 --> 24:06.811
And it turned out it's,
basically his dad's own blood.

24:06.813 --> 24:09.346
He walked back
into the room to find that,

24:09.348 --> 24:12.817
about 50 tons had,
dropped onto his dad.

24:12.819 --> 24:14.318
That's a pretty sad story
when, you know --

24:14.320 --> 24:16.887
you know, a son's finding
his father like that.

24:16.889 --> 24:18.456
So now, T.J.,
you mentioned on the phone,

24:18.458 --> 24:20.958
you found some more accidents
near my client's property.

24:20.960 --> 24:24.295
Basically December of 1907,
we have a Ray Clipper.

24:24.297 --> 24:27.431
Again, here's a guy
that's crushed to death.

24:27.433 --> 24:29.433
What a way to go. Mnh.

24:29.435 --> 24:31.569
This guy's only 21 years old.
- Yeah.

24:31.571 --> 24:33.437
In April 1920,

24:33.439 --> 24:36.474
Nelson Carl Smith
fell 20 feet.

24:36.476 --> 24:37.808
All right, so, T.J.,

24:37.810 --> 24:39.977
you said it started in 1896
with the mining.

24:39.979 --> 24:43.481
Do we know how long the mine
by my client's property lasted?

24:43.483 --> 24:47.418
The Robert Gage No. 8 mine
lasted until roughly about 1931.

24:49.722 --> 24:53.624
This cursed dead guy
is talking about tunnels,

24:53.626 --> 24:55.326
something about a tunnel.

24:55.328 --> 24:56.827
Tunnels, tunnels, tunnels.

24:59.165 --> 25:01.565
There's, like, multiple bodies,

25:01.567 --> 25:03.434
and he's just, like,
rambling about it.

25:03.436 --> 25:04.668
Where are they?

25:04.670 --> 25:06.036
They're just lyin' on the floor.

25:09.108 --> 25:11.642
How many?

25:11.644 --> 25:13.077
Three or four.

25:13.079 --> 25:14.345
Can you describe them?

25:14.347 --> 25:17.047
It's, like,
this mangled mess of flesh.

25:17.049 --> 25:19.049
He just says, "There's tunnels
all over the place,"

25:19.051 --> 25:21.685
and that we should put
the bodies in the tunnel

25:21.687 --> 25:23.087
'cause that's where they belong.

25:29.095 --> 25:32.062
I saw a lot of disturbing things
on my walk,

25:32.064 --> 25:33.998
but the dead lady
tormenting a living woman

25:34.000 --> 25:36.634
had me the most concerned.

25:36.636 --> 25:41.238
It was in
a small, blue room.

25:44.243 --> 25:45.843
She had eyes...
- Okay.

25:45.845 --> 25:48.479
...but they were not
human-looking.

25:49.782 --> 25:53.918
And then her face
looked like a witch.

25:57.957 --> 26:00.424
Is this what you saw?

26:00.426 --> 26:02.226
Yes, that's what I saw.

26:22.348 --> 26:25.182
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

26:25.184 --> 26:26.483
we're ready
to reveal our findings

26:26.485 --> 26:30.120
to each other and our clients
for the first time.

26:30.122 --> 26:31.422
Amy, I'd like you
to meet Janice.

26:31.424 --> 26:33.223
This is her daughter Kaleigh.

26:33.225 --> 26:37.328
Um, to put it bluntly,
what's goin' on here sucks.

26:37.330 --> 26:40.397
These two have no life.
They live in fear.

26:40.399 --> 26:42.399
And the worst part is they're
goin' through this alone.

26:42.401 --> 26:45.769
Now Janice's husband Michael...

26:48.441 --> 26:51.875
He's away in Africa working
for about 18 months.

26:51.877 --> 26:54.878
Now, they can't afford to leave,

26:54.880 --> 26:57.181
but they can't go on like this,

26:57.183 --> 27:00.584
so hopefully we can
help them out tonight.

27:00.586 --> 27:02.052
So now that Amy
knows just a little bit

27:02.054 --> 27:03.253
about who you are,

27:03.255 --> 27:06.123
I'm gonna ask her
to describe her walk.

27:06.125 --> 27:10.060
There are three conscious,
dead people

27:10.062 --> 27:13.464
that are causing issues here.

27:13.466 --> 27:16.934
But before I get
into discussing them,

27:16.936 --> 27:19.436
I wanted to tell you something

27:19.438 --> 27:22.806
that I got when I was
in the basement.

27:22.808 --> 27:26.710
When I was down there,
one of the deceased individuals

27:26.712 --> 27:30.614
was going on and on
about something about tunnels.

27:30.616 --> 27:35.019
And he was showing me maybe,
like, three or four dead people.

27:35.021 --> 27:36.920
But they were such a mess.

27:36.922 --> 27:40.124
Just, like, a clump of gore.

27:40.126 --> 27:45.929
And he told me that
these bodies needed to be moved

27:45.931 --> 27:48.532
into the tunnels
where they belonged.

27:48.534 --> 27:50.801
I didn't really have to think
about this one too long.

27:50.803 --> 27:52.169
Back in 1896,

27:52.171 --> 27:54.872
St. Charles became a really big
mining town for coal.

27:56.208 --> 27:59.677
Take a look at this map of...

27:59.679 --> 28:02.279
the Robert Gage No. 8 mine.

28:02.281 --> 28:04.682
Your house sits right here.

28:04.684 --> 28:06.350
This is the end of the mine.

28:06.352 --> 28:08.452
Yeah, that makes sense.

28:08.454 --> 28:10.821
As you guys probably know,
mining's dangerous work.

28:10.823 --> 28:11.989
The expert I spoke to told me

28:11.991 --> 28:13.257
there was a ton
of accidents here --

28:13.259 --> 28:15.559
cave-ins, explosions,
the whole nine yards.

28:15.561 --> 28:16.760
I've actually got a photo.

28:16.762 --> 28:18.629
This is a picture
of what it would look

28:18.631 --> 28:20.597
like when a mine
caved in on somebody.

28:20.599 --> 28:23.500
- My god.
- Wow.

28:23.502 --> 28:24.835
In 1901,

28:24.837 --> 28:27.771
an accident just like this
happened within 5,000 feet

28:27.773 --> 28:29.039
from your property here.

28:29.041 --> 28:33.477
The man working was basically
crushed to death.

28:33.479 --> 28:34.611
Wow.

28:38.784 --> 28:41.819
The first dead person
that I'm going to talk about

28:41.821 --> 28:44.488
is the female
that I encountered.

28:44.490 --> 28:46.090
She's very creepy.

28:46.092 --> 28:47.891
She kind of spooked me.

28:47.893 --> 28:51.095
She likes to torture
living people.

28:51.097 --> 28:53.864
One of the things
that I saw her doing

28:53.866 --> 28:56.667
was messing around
with shoes and, like,

28:56.669 --> 28:59.436
throwing them
and moving them about.

28:59.438 --> 29:04.775
And in the very back bedroom,
um, I saw her smother people.

29:04.777 --> 29:06.443
Like, they couldn't breathe.

29:06.445 --> 29:08.545
Is it possible that these guys
would be able to see her?

29:08.547 --> 29:10.547
It's possible.

29:10.549 --> 29:12.549
Janice encountered a female.

29:12.551 --> 29:13.951
Tried to slap me.

29:13.953 --> 29:16.720
Ooh! Okay.

29:16.722 --> 29:18.021
Tell her what happened
in the kitchen.

29:18.023 --> 29:19.523
I was doin' the dishes,

29:19.525 --> 29:21.391
and the tea bags
were on the top shelf.

29:21.393 --> 29:24.862
And they came flying off
and landed, um, behind my feet.

29:24.864 --> 29:26.396
Okay.

29:26.398 --> 29:28.132
Does she do anything else,
this woman?

29:28.134 --> 29:32.836
Yes. One of her things to do
is to creep up behind people.

29:32.838 --> 29:36.240
One of her favorite areas
is this blue room here.

29:36.242 --> 29:41.812
I saw her, like,
creeping out of the closet.

29:41.814 --> 29:45.716
Very slowly opening the door,

29:45.718 --> 29:47.084
then she'll rush.

29:52.391 --> 29:55.259
I thought that maybe
the living would experience,

29:55.261 --> 29:58.362
like, kind of a panic attack
kind of feeling...

29:58.364 --> 30:00.764
- Associated with this.

30:00.766 --> 30:05.202
That closet, um,
is also connected to my bedroom.

30:05.204 --> 30:07.304
- And I'll here, like,

30:07.306 --> 30:09.640
knocking noises, almost like
stuff is falling over.

30:09.642 --> 30:11.975
- Interesting.
- She watches.

30:11.977 --> 30:13.143
- I feel...
- Yeah.

30:13.145 --> 30:15.546
...constantly watched
wherever we are.

30:15.548 --> 30:18.382
I mean, I always feel like
I have to look over my shoulder

30:18.384 --> 30:21.485
and make sure that, you know,
there's nobody there.

30:21.487 --> 30:25.255
I did have a sketch done
of what I saw her doing.

30:28.661 --> 30:29.960
****.

30:33.332 --> 30:35.599
- My god.
- My god.

30:40.840 --> 30:42.439
I don't like that.

30:48.647 --> 30:51.415
That's creepy.

30:51.417 --> 30:53.984
She's...in my room as well?

30:53.986 --> 30:55.118
Which room is yours?

30:55.120 --> 30:57.654
- The pink one.
- Ä°n the closet.

30:57.656 --> 31:00.757
And that's why I don't
like my closet.

31:06.098 --> 31:07.564
Who do you think
this woman might have been

31:07.566 --> 31:08.899
when she was alive?

31:08.901 --> 31:11.668
She was actually pretty.

31:11.670 --> 31:15.172
I got that she had either
a lot of men in her life

31:15.174 --> 31:18.175
or was
married multiple times.

31:18.177 --> 31:21.745
Um...her family tried

31:21.747 --> 31:24.248
or did have her locked away
at some point.

31:24.250 --> 31:28.518
They thought that she was kind
of a disgrace to the family.

31:28.520 --> 31:32.856
And I got that she is jealous
of a female here,

31:32.858 --> 31:35.325
and that's why
she's acting out so much.

31:38.230 --> 31:41.465
Well, we got the elephant
in the room to talk about.

31:41.467 --> 31:44.568
I know the three of us are
thinking about the same person.

31:44.570 --> 31:46.970
You know what? This is
who we're talking about.

31:49.074 --> 31:51.108
These are the remains
of her mother-in-law Ruth.

31:51.110 --> 31:53.644
In 2013, Ruth dies of...
leukemia?

31:53.646 --> 31:54.778
Yes.

31:54.780 --> 31:56.246
Now, when they brought
the ashes home

31:56.248 --> 31:57.614
is when things got violent.

31:57.616 --> 31:58.949
Wow.

31:58.951 --> 32:01.084
Do me a favor, Janice.
Tell her how she was in life.

32:01.086 --> 32:04.621
She wasn't a very good person.
She traumatized Mike.

32:07.159 --> 32:10.761
When she was married
to Mike's dad,

32:10.763 --> 32:15.032
she had multiple lovers,

32:15.034 --> 32:17.868
and did it in front of Mike.

32:18.971 --> 32:20.203
She didn't like you either.

32:20.205 --> 32:22.606
No, she didn't like me.

32:22.608 --> 32:24.574
I got photos of her
at different ages.

32:26.712 --> 32:29.947
Wow.

32:31.717 --> 32:33.684
Any idea if this might be
who you saw?

32:33.686 --> 32:35.085
- Yes.
- Okay.

32:35.087 --> 32:37.521
Her face is
exactly like that.

32:46.932 --> 32:48.598
What else is goin' on?

32:48.600 --> 32:51.969
Then I saw a dead child.

32:51.971 --> 32:56.206
So I'd actually put him
between 7 and 8 years of age.

32:56.208 --> 32:58.642
And he was wearing
a funny outfit,

32:58.644 --> 33:00.777
kind of resembled
lederhosen.

33:00.779 --> 33:06.550
He interacts consistently
with the living here.

33:06.552 --> 33:08.752
I saw him touching
living people.

33:08.754 --> 33:12.356
Um, specifically,
caressing faces,

33:12.358 --> 33:14.358
playing with their hair.

33:14.360 --> 33:18.528
The problem with him is that if
there's any living children

33:18.530 --> 33:20.230
within the vicinity,

33:20.232 --> 33:25.535
he will try to, like,
glom on to them.

33:26.972 --> 33:31.908
It's very bad for the living
because it can make them sick.

33:31.910 --> 33:34.578
It can cause
major health problems,

33:34.580 --> 33:39.016
one of which
could be heart issues.

33:40.319 --> 33:42.919
He can also become
violent.

33:42.921 --> 33:46.089
When I was talking to him
in the middle room,

33:46.091 --> 33:51.862
I suddenly had, like,
a horrible blow to my head.

33:52.831 --> 33:56.033
Well, that just about hit
every friggin' experience

33:56.035 --> 33:57.401
you guys are goin' through.

33:57.403 --> 34:02.239
I have had stomach problems
ever since I was a baby.

34:02.241 --> 34:04.141
Now on top of that,

34:04.143 --> 34:07.277
there's something wrong
with my heart.

34:07.279 --> 34:08.545
Wow.

34:08.547 --> 34:10.246
They still have no idea
what's wrong.

34:16.621 --> 34:20.824
See, I think she's doing this.
I think she's doin' you.

34:23.027 --> 34:25.262
I think the kid's doin' you.

34:27.699 --> 34:31.101
It's like you're his toy.

34:34.005 --> 34:35.138
You said there are
three dead people

34:35.139 --> 34:36.840
you're concerned about.

34:36.842 --> 34:40.243
The other person was
this guy,

34:40.245 --> 34:42.512
and he is
a pretty serious threat.

34:42.514 --> 34:45.715
He's somehow related
to this little kid.

34:45.717 --> 34:48.618
I don't know if it was father
or grandfather.

34:48.620 --> 34:50.087
One of the things
about this guy

34:50.089 --> 34:53.356
is that he feels
extreme sense of guilt.

34:53.358 --> 34:55.625
Um, I saw him at one point

34:55.627 --> 34:57.294
where he, like,
falls to his knees.

34:57.296 --> 34:59.963
And he's like,
"Aah! It's all the curse.

34:59.965 --> 35:02.332
It's the curse.
I caused the curse."

35:02.334 --> 35:04.768
Somehow he lost
his entire family

35:04.770 --> 35:07.471
and he feels completely
responsible for it.

35:07.473 --> 35:09.806
What I got about him was
that he worked outside a lot.

35:09.808 --> 35:11.475
I felt like he was a farmer.

35:11.477 --> 35:13.477
He lived on the property,
died on the property,

35:13.479 --> 35:15.345
was buried on this property.

35:15.347 --> 35:16.847
So I do have one guy
in my research

35:16.849 --> 35:18.615
that fits that bill.

35:18.617 --> 35:19.850
One of the first owners

35:19.852 --> 35:22.152
of the property
was a guy named John Baumler.

35:22.154 --> 35:23.520
He was a German immigrant

35:23.522 --> 35:26.123
who came to the country in 1880
at the age of 29.

35:26.125 --> 35:29.226
So when she said "lederhosen,"
it kind of made sense.

35:29.228 --> 35:31.294
Now you mentioned he lost
his entire family.

35:31.296 --> 35:32.796
When he crossed the Atlantic
with his wife,

35:32.798 --> 35:35.031
he had a baby girl
and a 2-year-old boy.

35:35.033 --> 35:36.867
But within 2 weeks
of arriving in America,

35:36.869 --> 35:38.502
they were both gone, both dead.

35:38.504 --> 35:39.903
Jeez.

35:39.905 --> 35:42.639
We think they died of some kind
of disease on the boat.

35:42.641 --> 35:44.141
There's no records of it.

35:44.143 --> 35:46.409
He must have felt guilty
about putting his family at risk

35:46.411 --> 35:48.211
by bringing them over here.

35:48.213 --> 35:50.480
Now I wish this was the end
of John Baumler's story,

35:50.482 --> 35:52.716
but this was just the beginning.

35:52.718 --> 35:56.186
Four years after gettin'
into town, Baumler's wife dies.

35:56.188 --> 35:58.488
Now, get this --
over the next 30 years,

35:58.490 --> 35:59.890
he's married three more times,

35:59.892 --> 36:01.858
and every single one
of them died.

36:01.860 --> 36:04.828
- That's insane!
- He marries a fifth time.

36:04.830 --> 36:07.364
No.
He should've just stopped.

36:07.366 --> 36:09.799
For 9 years, until 1929,

36:09.801 --> 36:11.968
he lived right here on your land
where the house is built.

36:11.970 --> 36:15.639
And, he gets killed
by a hit-and-run.

36:15.641 --> 36:17.607
What?
I got
his death certificate here.

36:18.677 --> 36:20.810
This guy had one of the most
miserable lives I've...

36:20.812 --> 36:22.245
My god.

36:22.247 --> 36:25.048
...ever come across.
- Wow.

36:25.050 --> 36:27.884
Do you think this is
who you might've seen?
Yes.

36:31.757 --> 36:33.757
Now you said you were worried
about this guy.

36:33.759 --> 36:35.825
What's he do?
- This was interesting.

36:35.827 --> 36:38.762
He can't do
anything physical,

36:38.764 --> 36:43.733
but he's, like,
mastered emotional abuse.

36:43.735 --> 36:46.603
Living people will become
extremely overwhelmed

36:46.605 --> 36:49.639
by these sudden emotions.

36:49.641 --> 36:53.610
One of them is shame, feeling
an intense amount of shame

36:53.612 --> 36:56.880
for no reason,
guilt for no reason,

36:56.882 --> 36:59.683
feeling sad for no reason.

36:59.685 --> 37:02.919
I...

37:02.921 --> 37:07.324
I feel guilty for not bein' able
to take care of her.

37:07.326 --> 37:12.796
I feel guilty about things
that happened in my past.

37:12.798 --> 37:15.332
I've been constantly saying
that I'm overwhelmed.

37:15.334 --> 37:19.035
Do you think that this guy
could be influencing her?

37:19.037 --> 37:20.370
Yeah.

37:22.674 --> 37:25.875
His favorite area
is the basement.

37:28.046 --> 37:31.181
When I was down there,
I got,

37:31.183 --> 37:35.252
that he had his sights
set on a male.

37:37.889 --> 37:39.656
He felt like this male was

37:39.658 --> 37:42.792
an extremely easy target
for him.

37:42.794 --> 37:46.396
I got that the living male comes
and goes from the house a lot.

37:46.398 --> 37:49.933
I got that he does have
emotional issues.

37:49.935 --> 37:53.103
And he will act out,

37:53.105 --> 37:55.605
in anger and lash out.

37:55.607 --> 37:57.040
I got that
if this living male

37:57.042 --> 38:00.577
is exposed
to this dead male

38:00.579 --> 38:03.380
for a long period of time,

38:03.382 --> 38:06.783
that it would, like,
drive him insane.

38:06.785 --> 38:07.984
You know we're talkin'
about Mike.

38:07.986 --> 38:10.453
He's the only living male
in this house.

38:10.455 --> 38:13.189
When he spend a lot
of time in the basement,

38:13.191 --> 38:15.358
it's like
walking on eggshells.

38:15.360 --> 38:18.295
He's agitated, angry.

38:18.297 --> 38:20.730
We can't do anything right.

38:20.732 --> 38:22.399
You know, he should be nicer.

38:22.401 --> 38:26.136
But, I mean,
if he's in the basement,

38:26.138 --> 38:28.004
it's horrible.

38:28.006 --> 38:30.974
Does he recall these outbursts
that he has?

38:30.976 --> 38:33.877
No.
Okay. It's worse --
worse than I thought.

38:35.947 --> 38:37.380
This dead guy
you're talkin' about,

38:37.382 --> 38:38.648
what does he want?

38:38.650 --> 38:44.354
He views this entire space
as his personal hell.

38:44.356 --> 38:48.491
He's very depressed
and he wants to be alone.

38:48.493 --> 38:50.960
He is at the point
where he's willing to do

38:50.962 --> 38:55.365
whatever it takes
to get y'all out of this space.

39:14.753 --> 39:16.119
Well, Janice,
it's been a tough night,

39:16.121 --> 39:18.021
but at least you got
a lot of answers.

39:18.023 --> 39:19.656
The only thing
we haven't told you yet

39:19.658 --> 39:22.325
is whether you can
make this home safe again

39:22.327 --> 39:24.294
so you can finally
get the peace

39:24.296 --> 39:28.698
you deserve for you
and your family.

39:28.700 --> 39:32.335
For that, I'm gonna
turn it over to Amy.

39:32.337 --> 39:35.605
The first thing
that you would need to do

39:35.607 --> 39:39.609
is to find a male medium

39:39.611 --> 39:42.812
and a priest.

39:42.814 --> 39:45.515
The first day,

39:45.517 --> 39:49.552
you're going to deal
with Grandma.

39:49.554 --> 39:54.190
And the male medium
will start with her.

39:54.192 --> 39:58.094
My hope is that
you'll let her vent,

39:58.096 --> 40:02.465
and some things can be
just kind of laid to rest.

40:02.467 --> 40:04.000
And then she'll move on.

40:04.002 --> 40:06.569
Now if she doesn't do this,

40:06.571 --> 40:10.407
then the priest
will then make her leave.

40:10.409 --> 40:12.776
Okay, so how's he gonna
take care of that?

40:12.778 --> 40:14.778
He'll exorcise her.

40:16.948 --> 40:20.950
For the boy,
bring the male medium back.

40:20.952 --> 40:23.186
Male medium
will engage the boy --

40:23.188 --> 40:25.088
this might be
for a few hours --

40:25.090 --> 40:26.556
and will move him on.

40:26.558 --> 40:29.392
Now another day,

40:29.394 --> 40:32.862
again for a few hours,
male medium comes back,

40:32.864 --> 40:36.699
and he's going to focus
on the cursed dead male.

40:36.701 --> 40:40.804
Now, this male, as well,
may have a lot to talk about.

40:40.806 --> 40:42.572
Just sit back
and listen,

40:42.574 --> 40:45.542
and then he'll move on.

40:48.280 --> 40:53.216
The look on your face
went from sobbing to, like,

40:53.218 --> 40:54.784
"Hey, I can stay in my house."

40:54.786 --> 40:56.486
I can stay in my house.
Yeah.

40:56.488 --> 40:59.756
- How's that make you feel?
- Wonderful. Yeah.

40:59.758 --> 41:02.792
I'm gonna take Amy's advice.
Yeah.

41:02.794 --> 41:04.294
Okay.

41:04.296 --> 41:06.162
That's the first time
I've seen you smile in a week.

41:06.164 --> 41:07.530
Yeah.

41:07.532 --> 41:10.266
- How do you feel, Kaleigh?
- Relieved that we can stay.

41:10.268 --> 41:12.936
Will her health issues
get better?

41:12.938 --> 41:14.304
- Yes.
- Cool.

41:14.306 --> 41:16.306
What about Mike,
when he comes home?

41:16.308 --> 41:17.607
If they do all this,

41:17.609 --> 41:19.843
will his attitude change
when he's in the basement?

41:19.845 --> 41:23.546
Yeah. Yeah.

41:23.548 --> 41:25.582
I'm very happy with...

41:25.584 --> 41:28.084
That we got answers, for one.

41:28.086 --> 41:31.754
Yeah, 'cause we've been dealing
with this for a while.

41:35.093 --> 41:37.727
With the help
of a male medium and a priest,

41:37.729 --> 41:40.997
Janice and Kaleigh
can set the dead free,

41:40.999 --> 41:44.434
giving them a safe and peaceful
home for Mike to return to.
