01:37.069 --> 01:38.986
Hold it right there!

01:38.987 --> 01:40.822
What do you think you're doing?

01:40.823 --> 01:42.940
The charges stand as follows.

01:44.376 --> 01:47.545
A man identified as John Wilkinson Thackery

01:47.546 --> 01:50.381
was apprehended inside a pharmacy

01:50.382 --> 01:52.884
at number 745 Hudson Street

01:52.885 --> 01:55.503
at 3:00 this morning.

01:55.504 --> 01:58.055
At that time, he was observed

01:58.056 --> 02:00.892
to have in his possession
an assorted half dozen

02:00.893 --> 02:04.312
stolen bottles of cocaine and paregoric.

02:04.313 --> 02:05.730
Paregoric?

02:05.731 --> 02:07.732
The man doesn't have enough problems.

02:07.733 --> 02:09.984
He suffers from diarrhea, too.

02:09.985 --> 02:12.186
Ever since this country's cargo ships

02:12.187 --> 02:14.071
became bottled up in the Far East,

02:14.072 --> 02:17.108
not a night goes by we don't
arrest a couple desperate hopheads

02:17.109 --> 02:19.110
or them that would sell it to them.

02:19.111 --> 02:21.362
Surely you don't mean to include

02:21.363 --> 02:24.448
Dr. Thackery among those miscreants?

02:24.449 --> 02:27.084
He is a white man, those
are immigrant crimes.

02:27.085 --> 02:29.253
He was holding a hypodermic needle.

02:29.254 --> 02:31.455
He is also a practicing doctor.

02:31.456 --> 02:33.341
And he had removed his shoes.

02:33.342 --> 02:35.208
Captain...

02:37.012 --> 02:41.132
if I can convince the owner of the pharmacy

02:41.133 --> 02:46.187
to drop his complaints
against Dr. Thackery...

02:47.856 --> 02:52.610
...will this sufficiently
satisfy your understanding

02:52.611 --> 02:55.011
of the letter and the spirit of the law?

02:56.448 --> 02:59.617
Breaking and entering carries
with it a minimum sentence

02:59.618 --> 03:02.820
of five years at Sing Sing.

03:08.327 --> 03:12.112
And something for the
roundsmen who apprehended him.

03:22.007 --> 03:25.508
So I think this makes
us even, don't you think?

03:28.347 --> 03:30.481
You need a lift?

03:30.482 --> 03:32.099
No, thank you.

03:32.100 --> 03:34.684
I need to stretch my legs.

03:49.451 --> 03:51.401
Where do you live?

03:52.504 --> 03:55.339
Park Avenue just below the train station.

03:55.340 --> 03:57.457
Climb aboard.

04:08.270 --> 04:11.588
Oh, to your health, sir.

04:15.060 --> 04:17.343
Ah.

04:18.613 --> 04:20.982
What are you even about?

04:20.983 --> 04:22.566
What?

04:22.567 --> 04:25.152
I always assumed the reason Dr. Thackery

04:25.153 --> 04:28.406
never decamped to a
more prestigious hospital

04:28.407 --> 04:31.774
is because he was in
some way indebted to you.

04:32.794 --> 04:36.414
Let me ask you a question, Mr. Barrow.

04:36.415 --> 04:39.250
I'm not going to find out to my displeasure

04:39.251 --> 04:44.088
that you've known about Dr.
Thackery's condition all along, am I?

04:44.089 --> 04:47.892
I can say that I never
wanted to believe this

04:47.893 --> 04:50.428
about Dr. Thackery.

04:50.429 --> 04:53.431
I bought myself a hospital full of doctors.

04:53.432 --> 04:57.850
You ought to be able to
find one who can treat him.

04:58.770 --> 05:00.271
Here's something that'll interest you.

05:00.272 --> 05:04.408
"Narcotic shortages caused
by the war wreak havoc here.

05:04.409 --> 05:07.361
A case in point... last
night a man identified

05:07.362 --> 05:09.196
as a prominent New York doctor

05:09.197 --> 05:12.199
was arrested after breaking
into a Greenwich Village pharmacy

05:12.200 --> 05:15.619
in order to meet the increasingly
desperate needs of his patients.

05:15.620 --> 05:17.338
Informed of the doctor's motives,

05:17.339 --> 05:20.708
the proprietor of the
pharmacy, Mr. W.A. Cleveland,

05:20.709 --> 05:24.711
hailed his selflessness and
subsequently withdrew the complaint."

05:39.978 --> 05:42.345
John?

05:43.532 --> 05:46.015
John, let me in!

05:48.570 --> 05:50.371
You alone?

05:50.372 --> 05:53.656
Of course I am. Who would I be with?

06:01.833 --> 06:03.834
"When sorrows come,

06:03.835 --> 06:06.003
they come not single spies,

06:06.004 --> 06:08.172
but in battalions."

06:08.173 --> 06:11.142
- I beg your pardon?
- Who sent you?

06:11.143 --> 06:14.011
- Nobody sent me.
- Was it Robertson?

06:14.012 --> 06:15.479
- Miss Robertson?
- Her father.

06:15.480 --> 06:17.264
Did that son of a bitch
send you to spy on me?

06:17.265 --> 06:19.599
John, did something
happen to you last night?

06:24.823 --> 06:26.407
You look terrible.

06:26.408 --> 06:28.859
- When did you last eat?
- I'm not hungry.

06:28.860 --> 06:30.361
Have you slept?

06:30.362 --> 06:33.080
That is the question.

06:33.081 --> 06:36.200
I've never been more tired in my life.

06:36.201 --> 06:37.952
Why don't you let me give you a bath

06:37.953 --> 06:39.420
and put you to bed?

06:39.421 --> 06:42.789
I can't go to bed. I have bedbugs.

06:43.708 --> 06:45.209
You don't have bedbugs.

06:45.210 --> 06:47.428
I can feel them under my skin.

06:47.429 --> 06:50.381
I've treated people with bedbugs
and that's not what they do.

06:50.382 --> 06:53.750
Wait a minute. How did you know
something happened to me last night?

06:58.106 --> 07:00.256
Barrow sent you, didn't he?

07:01.726 --> 07:03.861
It was in the morning newspaper.

07:03.862 --> 07:05.946
- I don't believe you.
- It didn't name you.

07:05.947 --> 07:06.950
But the way you've been...

07:06.951 --> 07:08.400
- acting, I just assumed...
- I don't believe you.

07:08.401 --> 07:10.618
It was Barrow who sent you
to spy on me, wasn't it?

07:10.619 --> 07:12.935
Wasn't it?!

07:18.910 --> 07:21.277
Oh, God.

07:22.998 --> 07:25.331
Oh, God.

07:55.780 --> 07:57.980
What can I do to help?

07:58.950 --> 08:01.317
Nothing.

08:04.289 --> 08:07.740
Just tell me what I can do.

08:17.269 --> 08:19.502
You can find me...

08:21.056 --> 08:24.056
an ocean of cocaine.

08:25.894 --> 08:27.144
Look here.

08:27.145 --> 08:28.562
What's your game?

08:28.563 --> 08:32.399
Well, I assure you there
is no game, Mr. Collier.

08:32.400 --> 08:35.486
You don't think I know why you're here?

08:35.486 --> 08:37.988
You think I don't know how to read

08:37.989 --> 08:39.907
between the lines?

08:39.908 --> 08:42.909
That was your man Thackery, wasn't it?

08:42.910 --> 08:46.914
Your top doctor's turned out
to be a fucking cocaine fiend.

08:46.915 --> 08:49.833
You see what dire straits we're in

08:49.834 --> 08:52.386
when a man of Dr. Thackery's
reputation must resort

08:52.387 --> 08:54.672
to burglary for the sake of his patients.

08:54.673 --> 08:56.340
Oh, for Christ's sake.

08:56.341 --> 08:58.175
I'm in the hooker trade.

08:58.176 --> 09:01.844
You don't think I recognize
a burny blower when I see one?

09:02.931 --> 09:04.815
Then you also know

09:04.816 --> 09:06.900
that it is in your best interest

09:06.901 --> 09:10.187
to get Dr. Thackery back on his feet.

09:10.188 --> 09:13.556
Because I can never repay you without him.

09:14.826 --> 09:17.528
Well, I ain't gonna
loan you any more money,

09:17.529 --> 09:18.829
I'll tell you that right now.

09:18.830 --> 09:22.866
But I may find it in my heart

09:22.867 --> 09:26.670
to advance your man some
few bindles of the drug.

09:26.671 --> 09:28.672
You can do that?

09:28.673 --> 09:32.543
Ain't you been listening?
I'm in the hooker line.

09:32.544 --> 09:34.845
How do you think these dumb young clucks

09:34.846 --> 09:37.631
are able to face each day of
their miserable fucking lives?

09:37.632 --> 09:40.718
Cocaine, morphine, ether...

09:40.719 --> 09:44.438
I can get my hands on practically anything.

09:44.439 --> 09:47.891
Consider it part of your loan.

09:47.892 --> 09:50.343
Mr. Collier...

09:51.529 --> 09:54.730
I don't know how to thank you.

09:55.400 --> 09:57.484
Oh. Oh.

09:57.485 --> 09:59.737
Oh.

09:59.738 --> 10:02.906
You can thank me

10:02.907 --> 10:06.994
by never again fucking telling me

10:06.995 --> 10:10.297
what's in my fucking best interest,

10:10.298 --> 10:12.498
you fucking mutt!

10:13.718 --> 10:16.786
That's no problem at all. And thank you.

10:36.358 --> 10:38.609
Dr. Johnston from Metropolitan

10:38.610 --> 10:40.778
did black out at the
last surgical conference.

10:40.779 --> 10:42.863
It was a bit of a scandal, really.

10:42.864 --> 10:44.865
I'd wager anything it was Thackery.

10:44.866 --> 10:46.583
Don't let me interrupt.

10:46.584 --> 10:49.670
I believe you were all
talking about Dr. Thackery.

10:49.671 --> 10:53.340
It would account for the
superhuman energy he has.

10:53.341 --> 10:56.993
Perhaps it's what distinguishes
a great man from an ordinary one.

10:58.296 --> 11:01.265
I'd say it's more likely
some sort of drug addiction.

11:01.266 --> 11:04.218
What's the man accused of stealing?

11:04.219 --> 11:07.638
- Cocaine and paregoric.
- Why paregoric?

11:07.639 --> 11:09.973
They drink it for the
camphorated opium it contains

11:09.974 --> 11:12.643
so they're able to sleep on those
rare occasions when they actually do.

11:12.644 --> 11:14.978
Thackery shows all the signs.

11:14.979 --> 11:19.149
Boundless energy, euphoria
alternating with exhaustion.

11:19.150 --> 11:21.235
Insomnia, paranoia,

11:21.236 --> 11:24.320
a compulsion to itch, hallucinations.

11:25.790 --> 11:28.542
In nursing school, I treated
some soldiers who were addicted.

11:28.543 --> 11:30.794
Nurse Elkins,

11:30.795 --> 11:34.280
do you have a moment to
discuss next week's rotation?

11:37.969 --> 11:39.636
I don't know.

11:39.637 --> 11:43.589
Johnston has this very weird laugh.

11:48.930 --> 11:52.566
I mean, we shouldn't rule him out.

11:52.567 --> 11:55.018
Tell me what you know
about Thackery's condition.

11:55.019 --> 11:57.488
I don't know anything.

11:57.489 --> 11:59.656
Your loyalty is commendable,

11:59.657 --> 12:02.493
but I need to know everything right now.

12:02.494 --> 12:05.027
I don't know a thing.

12:06.030 --> 12:10.751
Let's both of us be frank here, shall we?

12:10.752 --> 12:13.170
You're betraying no confidences here.

12:13.171 --> 12:17.373
I was the one who fetched him from
the police station this morning.

12:19.878 --> 12:21.879
Is there really no cocaine to be found?

12:21.880 --> 12:23.881
No, there is not.

12:23.882 --> 12:25.883
And I ought to know.

12:25.884 --> 12:28.218
Since this war began,
I've been horse-trading

12:28.219 --> 12:31.555
every manner of drugs from
every reputable hospital

12:31.556 --> 12:33.557
and pharmaceutical
company on the East Coast.

12:33.558 --> 12:35.591
What about the disreputable ones?

12:48.072 --> 12:50.489
Is there anything I can do?

12:51.626 --> 12:54.495
Pray for peace in the Philippines.

12:54.496 --> 12:56.246
Not now.

12:56.247 --> 12:58.131
Well, I suppose you get what you pay for.

12:58.132 --> 12:59.800
How did this happen?

12:59.801 --> 13:01.635
He stubbed his toe against a table leg.

13:01.636 --> 13:03.971
Looks like he gave it a good swift kick.

13:03.972 --> 13:06.006
It wasn't nothing but
a little cut at first.

13:06.007 --> 13:09.176
But it won't close and
that was two weeks ago.

13:09.177 --> 13:10.928
Was he always like this?

13:10.929 --> 13:13.897
A couple of times a day
whenever he's not eating,

13:13.898 --> 13:16.149
and he's always eating. I
never knew a boy who ate...

13:16.150 --> 13:18.735
Dr. Edwards, when you're finished,

13:18.736 --> 13:21.137
I need to talk to you in your office.

13:23.825 --> 13:25.808
Wait for me there.

13:51.686 --> 13:53.502
You're late?

13:54.439 --> 13:56.756
Three weeks late.

14:07.235 --> 14:08.735
Could it be Phillip's?

14:08.736 --> 14:10.487
No.

14:10.488 --> 14:12.938
That's impossible.

14:37.515 --> 14:40.850
Algie, do you want to keep the child?

14:42.487 --> 14:44.354
Yes.

14:44.355 --> 14:47.723
Stop and think about it a little.

14:49.027 --> 14:51.495
I don't need to think about it.

14:51.496 --> 14:53.196
It's our child, Cornelia.

14:53.197 --> 14:55.397
Keep your voice down.

14:58.536 --> 15:00.569
Don't you?

15:02.540 --> 15:04.824
I do.

15:06.427 --> 15:10.380
And I wouldn't even hesitate to lie
about who the father is if only...

15:10.381 --> 15:15.217
If only it wasn't a colored man.

15:18.139 --> 15:21.557
Everyone will know when they see the child.

15:35.707 --> 15:37.574
Does it...

15:37.575 --> 15:39.909
does it have to be a procedure?

15:40.828 --> 15:43.664
Is there a medicine?

15:43.665 --> 15:45.664
No.

15:47.885 --> 15:50.137
A girl I knew at school said she heard

15:50.138 --> 15:52.172
there was an old Indian remedy.

15:52.173 --> 15:56.041
There's no proven method except surgery.

16:24.338 --> 16:27.124
Edwards, stop right there.

16:27.125 --> 16:28.792
I really haven't the time, Doctor.

16:28.793 --> 16:30.427
If you'll kindly excuse me.

16:30.428 --> 16:32.763
Edwards.

16:32.764 --> 16:35.932
You cannot change treatment
on one of my patients

16:35.933 --> 16:37.768
without my prior approval.

16:37.769 --> 16:40.103
To do so is nothing less than
a breach of medical ethics.

16:40.104 --> 16:42.305
- Which patient are you...
- Miss Gibson.

16:42.306 --> 16:44.141
Which is she?

16:44.142 --> 16:47.060
She's the woman who ingested
the so-called sanitized tapeworm

16:47.061 --> 16:49.863
in order to slim her figure.

16:49.864 --> 16:51.565
You cannot be serious.

16:51.566 --> 16:53.483
- Do you remember her or not?
- Yes.

16:53.484 --> 16:56.620
Yes, I remember her. Miss
Gibson, the rich, fat white lady.

16:56.621 --> 16:58.205
- Edwards.
- I remember thinking

16:58.206 --> 17:00.073
no one will ever make the
mistake of confusing her

17:00.074 --> 17:01.491
with the real "Gibson Girl."

17:01.492 --> 17:03.577
Don't walk away from me!

17:03.578 --> 17:05.996
You prescribed castor oil as a purgative.

17:05.997 --> 17:07.464
And what is wrong with that?

17:07.464 --> 17:10.717
They have been prescribing
castor oil as an anthelmintic

17:10.718 --> 17:13.167
since the time of the Egyptian pharaohs.

17:17.090 --> 17:19.259
Eleanor?

17:19.260 --> 17:21.877
Darling, what are you doing here?

17:23.347 --> 17:25.714
Are you feeling all right?

17:26.851 --> 17:30.020
I fear it's another brain fever.

17:30.021 --> 17:32.105
Are you feeling ill?

17:32.106 --> 17:34.324
No, it's the baby, Everett.

17:34.325 --> 17:37.527
But never you mind. I
think you'll be proud of me.

17:37.528 --> 17:39.412
I took a page from your book

17:39.413 --> 17:42.231
and put its little head in an ice bath.

17:44.752 --> 17:49.706
♪ I don't want to play in your yard ♪

17:49.707 --> 17:53.927
♪ I don't like you anymore ♪

17:53.928 --> 17:58.497
♪ You'll be sorry when you see me ♪

17:59.383 --> 18:03.052
♪ Sliding down our cellar door. ♪

18:07.391 --> 18:09.725
Don't stop.

18:13.614 --> 18:18.151
♪ You can't holler
down our rain barrel ♪

18:18.152 --> 18:21.770
♪ You can't climb our apple tree ♪

18:22.740 --> 18:26.827
♪ I don't want to play in your yard ♪

18:26.828 --> 18:30.746
♪ If you won't be good to me. ♪

18:36.470 --> 18:39.256
Where'd you get this?

18:39.257 --> 18:41.623
Barrow got it for you.

18:56.908 --> 18:59.308
Salt water.

19:33.978 --> 19:36.029
Now...

19:36.030 --> 19:40.099
what can I do for you this afternoon?

19:41.535 --> 19:43.769
I'm a friend of Dr. Thackery's.

19:45.323 --> 19:47.940
I thought you might know how
to get the cocaine he needs.

19:51.128 --> 19:54.331
It is difficult enough to acquire opium

19:54.332 --> 19:57.050
for my customers here.

19:57.051 --> 19:59.502
Please tell Dr. Thackery

19:59.503 --> 20:01.837
sorry.

20:06.978 --> 20:09.962
You have quite a dainty foot.

20:10.982 --> 20:13.733
In Chinese we say it is Jin ping Mei.

20:13.734 --> 20:17.821
A golden lotus.

20:17.822 --> 20:20.806
Here, I'll write it down for you.

20:25.029 --> 20:27.364
During the act of passion,

20:27.365 --> 20:31.584
a man's pleasure may
be enhanced immeasurably

20:31.585 --> 20:33.837
by having his concubine

20:33.838 --> 20:38.375
place her foot in his mouth.

20:38.376 --> 20:40.710
Do this for me,

20:40.711 --> 20:44.547
and I shall trade you

20:44.548 --> 20:47.050
10 grains of opium

20:47.051 --> 20:49.418
and...

20:51.389 --> 20:54.890
100 Yankee dollars.

21:32.480 --> 21:34.630
You heard the news?

21:35.649 --> 21:38.433
The whole hospital is in tears.

21:40.021 --> 21:43.055
Two little girls in as many months.

21:44.909 --> 21:47.776
If I was Everett, I don't
know what I would do.

21:49.196 --> 21:53.116
I suppose you'd find comfort in your faith.

21:53.117 --> 21:55.867
Faith isn't always a comfort.

21:57.838 --> 22:00.656
I've lost so many over the years.

22:02.793 --> 22:07.047
God blesses every child born and unborn

22:07.048 --> 22:09.381
with an immortal soul.

22:10.634 --> 22:12.769
All I can do is pray for them,

22:12.770 --> 22:16.722
especially the unbaptized
ones, wherever they may go.

22:18.776 --> 22:21.310
Aren't they all allowed into heaven?

22:22.780 --> 22:25.564
I just assumed.

22:28.369 --> 22:30.153
But we can hope

22:30.154 --> 22:33.706
that God in His infinite mercy

22:33.707 --> 22:37.859
will one day still welcome
them into His eternal communion.

22:39.830 --> 22:42.864
And may He do the same for me.

24:14.425 --> 24:16.092
What have you got for me?

24:16.093 --> 24:19.177
Lamb chops. I thought you might be hungry.

24:20.397 --> 24:23.632
Oh, Lucy, please don't tell
me you've come empty-handed.

24:25.269 --> 24:27.020
What is it?

24:27.021 --> 24:29.304
A few grains of opium.

24:35.863 --> 24:38.397
How did you know where to get this?

24:39.450 --> 24:43.336
Don't be angry, but I
followed you one night.

24:43.337 --> 24:45.954
You got it from Ping Wu?

24:48.509 --> 24:51.543
I'm sure he took quite a liking to you.

24:52.713 --> 24:55.014
As long as you didn't have
to put your golden lotus

24:55.015 --> 24:57.217
in his mouth to pay for it.

24:57.218 --> 25:00.669
Could you grab that lamp and matches?

25:06.560 --> 25:09.594
And light the lamp for me.

25:30.551 --> 25:33.418
Just hold that over the flame.

25:39.059 --> 25:40.876
Am I doing it right?

25:49.486 --> 25:52.437
Just hold it over here.

26:31.195 --> 26:33.929
How did you pay for this?

26:35.566 --> 26:37.599
My bicycle.

27:24.665 --> 27:26.532
Good morning, Dr. Edwards.

27:26.533 --> 27:28.000
Good morning.

27:28.001 --> 27:29.502
Nurse.

27:29.503 --> 27:32.288
I'm afraid it's just the
two of us on the ward today.

27:32.289 --> 27:36.291
Oh, well, doesn't appear to be
anything the pair of us can't handle.

27:37.711 --> 27:39.628
Shall we?

27:42.299 --> 27:44.634
Mr. Oates.

27:44.635 --> 27:46.886
I want you to open your eyes for me.

27:46.887 --> 27:48.971
And, please, don't be alarmed.

27:48.972 --> 27:50.640
I'm a colored man.

27:50.641 --> 27:53.808
Don't make any difference to me.

28:02.152 --> 28:03.653
Doctor?

28:03.654 --> 28:06.823
Patient presents capsulocretaceous
cataracts in both eyes.

28:06.824 --> 28:08.324
I advise surgery.

28:08.325 --> 28:09.742
Anesthetic?

28:09.743 --> 28:12.611
In the absence of cocaine,
I'd recommend Holocaine.

28:19.503 --> 28:21.554
Looks like we are meeting halfway.

28:21.555 --> 28:23.556
It would seem so.

28:23.557 --> 28:27.510
My father says that's a sure
sign of any good relationship.

28:27.511 --> 28:30.813
I was just headed to see if
Dr. Thackery needed anything.

28:30.814 --> 28:32.515
Mmm.

28:32.516 --> 28:35.902
You've been awfully solicitous
of Dr. Thackery lately.

28:35.903 --> 28:38.053
Should I be jealous?

28:39.072 --> 28:41.190
What do you mean?

28:41.191 --> 28:43.743
No, I just...

28:43.744 --> 28:45.727
What did you think?

28:46.580 --> 28:48.281
Nothing.

28:48.282 --> 28:50.867
Mr. Barrow is looking for you.

28:50.868 --> 28:54.203
No, sir, I did not say that.

28:54.204 --> 28:56.088
And I do sympathize with your situation.

28:56.089 --> 28:58.657
I just wish you'd show a
bit of sympathy for mine.

29:00.427 --> 29:02.879
No, sir, I have not had that privilege.

29:02.880 --> 29:04.713
Good-bye.

29:06.216 --> 29:07.717
Horse-trading?

29:07.718 --> 29:10.770
The army's requisitioned the
lot from the German Hospital.

29:10.771 --> 29:12.104
Waiting to arrange shipment

29:12.105 --> 29:14.056
to the US military post at Havana harbor.

29:14.057 --> 29:15.608
They can't be persuaded to part

29:15.609 --> 29:17.610
with a lousy hundred bindles or so?

29:17.611 --> 29:19.228
The army would never miss 'em.

29:19.229 --> 29:21.096
Not for love or money.

29:22.149 --> 29:25.067
Well, that's the Germans for you.

29:25.068 --> 29:28.654
Never been a race better at
squeezing the life out of a dime.

29:28.655 --> 29:30.989
I thought that was the Jews.

29:32.242 --> 29:35.026
Nice of you to grace us with
your presence this morning.

29:37.414 --> 29:38.998
How's Dr. Thackery? Better?

29:38.999 --> 29:42.784
No better. The drugs you
gave me were salt water.

29:44.254 --> 29:47.139
- Can you get your money back?
- I don't think so.

29:47.140 --> 29:49.308
Do you happen to speak any German?

29:49.309 --> 29:50.760
- What?
- Nothing.

29:50.761 --> 29:52.728
Go to work, Lucy.

29:52.729 --> 29:55.463
It's going to be a very long day.

29:59.820 --> 30:03.155
Dr. Thackery. Always a pleasure.

30:03.156 --> 30:05.608
What can I do for you today?

30:05.609 --> 30:08.160
It's more a question of
what I can do for you.

30:09.613 --> 30:14.250
I have agreed to accept your offer

30:14.251 --> 30:18.120
to endorse Thackery's
Rejuvenating Liniment.

30:18.121 --> 30:20.655
Uh-huh.

30:22.626 --> 30:24.544
I think you mean

30:24.545 --> 30:27.295
Peter's Rejuvenating Liniment.

30:28.298 --> 30:30.466
Perhaps you're acquainted with Dr. Peter

30:30.467 --> 30:32.935
of Cornell Medical.

30:32.936 --> 30:35.137
He's a fine doctor.

30:35.138 --> 30:36.722
Natural-born salesman, too.

30:36.723 --> 30:38.357
Can't you peddle two of them?

30:38.358 --> 30:40.726
That ship has sailed, Doc.

30:40.727 --> 30:43.896
In fact, it might be the only ship
that's sailed around here lately.

30:43.897 --> 30:46.032
That damn war in the Philippines

30:46.033 --> 30:48.234
has interrupted my supply of narcotics.

30:48.235 --> 30:51.320
They're prohibitively expensive
if they can be found at all.

30:51.321 --> 30:54.206
I venture to guess that's the reason

30:54.207 --> 30:55.875
for your coming here today?

30:55.876 --> 30:57.460
What's in this stuff anyway?

30:57.461 --> 31:00.997
Oh, blackstrap and whatever else
I can find for an added kick.

31:00.998 --> 31:03.948
- Cocaine?
- Would if I could find any.

31:11.892 --> 31:14.175
Mr. Luff...

31:15.679 --> 31:19.515
would you consider
giving me a small advance

31:19.516 --> 31:23.185
in earnest of the day when the war is over

31:23.186 --> 31:26.855
and you can sell one of
these with my name on it?

31:27.908 --> 31:30.225
I'm afraid I can't help you.

31:32.362 --> 31:34.696
Well, then I'm afraid...

31:36.033 --> 31:39.067
I will be forced to go to your competition.

31:40.037 --> 31:42.620
I'm afraid they won't help you either.

31:44.041 --> 31:45.791
You see, in our line of work,

31:45.792 --> 31:48.344
a man has to present to the customer

31:48.345 --> 31:52.580
a convincing air of healthful vitality.

31:54.301 --> 31:56.802
Not to mention trustworthiness

31:56.803 --> 31:58.220
and incorruptibility.

31:58.221 --> 32:00.222
Please, please, please, please.

32:00.223 --> 32:01.891
I'll do anything.

32:01.892 --> 32:05.361
Yes, that is exactly my point.

32:05.362 --> 32:08.114
Now, if you'll unhand me, sir,

32:08.115 --> 32:11.900
this moldy rogue has some
business to attend to.

32:37.094 --> 32:40.596
Nurse. Nurse. Nurse!

32:40.597 --> 32:43.065
I don't think I know you.

32:43.066 --> 32:44.684
No, ma'am.

32:44.685 --> 32:47.319
They sent me over from the
hospital's nursing school.

32:47.320 --> 32:48.688
Surgical specialty.

32:48.689 --> 32:51.691
Well, you should have come
to see me straightaway.

32:51.692 --> 32:55.444
I'm Nurse Braun, Superintendent of Nurses.

32:55.445 --> 32:57.279
Nurse...?

32:57.280 --> 32:58.948
Thackery.

32:58.949 --> 33:01.000
Welcome, Nurse Thackery.

33:01.001 --> 33:04.086
Scrub in and report to Herr Dr. Schmidt

33:04.087 --> 33:05.788
in the main surgery.

33:05.789 --> 33:07.540
Where is that, ma'am?

33:07.541 --> 33:10.259
The other end of this corridor on the left.

33:10.260 --> 33:12.128
And where is the drug dispensary, ma'am,

33:12.129 --> 33:14.130
in the event I'm asked to fetch something?

33:14.131 --> 33:16.215
Across the hall from it.

33:16.216 --> 33:18.216
Thank you, ma'am.

34:11.855 --> 34:14.356
What do you think you are doing?

34:14.357 --> 34:16.942
Dr. Schmidt asked me to fetch
him some supplies, ma'am.

34:16.943 --> 34:19.527
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- What's under your cape? Show me.

34:19.529 --> 34:22.248
I said remove your cape. Stop her!

34:22.248 --> 34:24.699
Stop that woman!

35:00.287 --> 35:02.236
Get undressed in there.

35:14.301 --> 35:17.670
Do you want me to get completely undressed?

35:17.671 --> 35:19.954
Yes, it's advisable.

35:27.397 --> 35:29.347
Because they'll be bleeding?

35:32.936 --> 35:36.572
The procedure is called
dilation and curettage.

35:36.573 --> 35:39.108
The cervix is dilated

35:39.109 --> 35:41.110
and an instrument called a curette

35:41.111 --> 35:44.695
is inserted to remove the...

35:45.749 --> 35:47.782
tissue.

35:48.952 --> 35:50.786
Will it hurt?

35:50.787 --> 35:53.738
No, you'll be etherized.

35:57.294 --> 35:59.293
Cover yourself with this.

36:23.787 --> 36:25.820
Algie.

36:27.073 --> 36:29.023
Algie.

36:31.661 --> 36:34.946
Algie, why won't you look at me?

36:47.644 --> 36:49.311
I can perform the procedure,

36:49.312 --> 36:51.347
but I cannot perform it on you.

36:51.348 --> 36:54.348
You have to.

36:55.852 --> 36:57.685
Please.

36:59.322 --> 37:02.607
I can't kill my own child.

37:03.660 --> 37:06.110
What are the alternatives?

37:13.086 --> 37:15.570
We could sail to Europe.

37:19.009 --> 37:21.075
Liberia.

37:23.263 --> 37:24.930
They're more tolerant there.

37:24.931 --> 37:26.548
Europe? Liberia?

37:26.549 --> 37:28.851
There's no place on earth
we can raise it, Algie.

37:28.852 --> 37:31.387
- Shh.
- Are you insane?

37:31.388 --> 37:33.838
We have no choice.

37:46.987 --> 37:49.070
I'm sorry.

37:52.409 --> 37:54.609
I...

37:55.912 --> 37:58.863
- I can't.
- Algie.

38:00.417 --> 38:03.117
- Please.
- I can't.

39:34.227 --> 39:37.345
Well done, Nurse Elkins.

39:53.997 --> 39:55.896
Here, let me do it.

40:07.427 --> 40:09.994
You're a resourceful girl.

40:12.382 --> 40:14.215
You're the most...

40:15.351 --> 40:17.585
resourceful...

40:19.856 --> 40:22.139
most wonderful...

40:23.810 --> 40:25.676
beautiful girl...

40:27.947 --> 40:30.097
I have ever known.

40:40.577 --> 40:43.160
Oh, you.

40:55.475 --> 40:58.092
Wait, let's douse your sex with it.

41:09.656 --> 41:11.773
No.

41:11.774 --> 41:14.024
Let's douse yours.
