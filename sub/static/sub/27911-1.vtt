Subtitles by explosiveskull

00:24.843 --> 00:27.544
My name is Grey Gideon.

00:27.546 --> 00:28.714
District C-11.

00:31.817 --> 00:32.884
Night division.

00:34.686 --> 00:37.687
I'm about to tell you a story.

00:37.689 --> 00:41.992
A story about how the
world is going to shit.

00:41.994 --> 00:44.764
A story where the bad guys win.

00:46.665 --> 00:48.632
In the not too distant future,

00:48.634 --> 00:52.736
governments created false
wars over religion and land.

00:52.738 --> 00:55.638
The wars started protests,

00:55.640 --> 00:57.840
the protests turned
into looting sprees

00:57.842 --> 00:59.945
which enacted Marshal Law.

01:01.612 --> 01:04.581
The military flexed their
muscles with tanks, jets,

01:04.583 --> 01:08.754
and helicopters, all paid
for by civilian tax payers.

01:09.755 --> 01:11.720
Ain't that a bitch?

01:11.722 --> 01:13.789
And the chaos
changed everyday life

01:13.791 --> 01:16.026
for those people
as they know it.

01:16.028 --> 01:19.799
Some resisted, and those
who did disappeared.

01:21.800 --> 01:23.632
The U.S. was
relatively unaffected

01:23.634 --> 01:25.768
until police killings
became too much

01:25.770 --> 01:27.670
for the public to bear.

01:27.672 --> 01:29.574
The people fought back.

01:30.809 --> 01:35.010
There was nothing for us to
do except maintain order.

01:35.012 --> 01:37.513
Most of this was
going on in the West,

01:37.515 --> 01:39.418
we were fine in Boston.

01:40.351 --> 01:42.722
Until someone killed the mayor.

01:43.788 --> 01:45.690
Until someone killed...

01:46.791 --> 01:47.626
My father.

01:54.398 --> 01:55.631
It's been too
long since we've had

01:55.633 --> 01:57.399
a night with just the two of us.

01:57.401 --> 02:00.772
Even longer since
you've cooked for me.

02:01.907 --> 02:04.577
Grey's gone all weekend and...

02:05.676 --> 02:08.345
We could always skip dinner.

02:08.347 --> 02:10.547
I'm up for that.

02:13.517 --> 02:14.854
Who can that be?

02:18.456 --> 02:20.757
Wait a minute, will ya?

02:21.892 --> 02:24.296
God damn it, give me a second.

02:31.635 --> 02:32.871
Mayor, Mayor!

02:35.974 --> 02:37.043
Mayor, Mayor.

02:38.809 --> 02:40.643
You scared yet?

02:41.480 --> 02:42.648
You should be.

02:45.984 --> 02:47.853
Well, here we are.

02:49.121 --> 02:50.823
Good guy, bad guy.

02:51.856 --> 02:53.325
Same old story.

02:54.892 --> 02:56.793
Except I think the
ending doesn't look

02:56.795 --> 02:58.794
so promising this time.

02:58.796 --> 02:59.631
For you.

03:01.599 --> 03:02.434
You...

03:03.100 --> 03:04.969
You should be proud.

03:05.970 --> 03:07.005
He's a good man

03:08.807 --> 03:12.978
who never, never, never
stops chasing the bad guys.

03:14.413 --> 03:16.881
Never could just leave us alone.

03:18.450 --> 03:22.185
Problem here, is that
your "war on drugs",

03:22.187 --> 03:25.023
whoa, it is causing
me a headache.

03:27.192 --> 03:29.192
And you know what else?

03:29.194 --> 03:32.095
You're costing me
a lot of money.

03:32.097 --> 03:35.764
Headache, money, headache,
money, headache, money.

03:35.766 --> 03:39.668
You gotta ask yourself
a question, you know?

03:39.670 --> 03:40.703
Is it worth it?

03:40.705 --> 03:43.173
You know what I'm talking about?

03:43.175 --> 03:44.573
Good man...

03:44.575 --> 03:45.041
Don't you hurt her.

03:45.043 --> 03:46.775
Oh relax.

03:46.777 --> 03:48.877
I want to know if this
notion you have of justice,

03:48.879 --> 03:50.979
which I don't even fucking
know what that means,

03:50.981 --> 03:52.982
but this notion of
justice that you have,

03:52.984 --> 03:54.150
is it worth it?

03:54.152 --> 03:55.752
Kill him.

03:55.754 --> 03:56.786
Kill him!

03:56.788 --> 03:58.954
Is it worth your life...

03:58.956 --> 04:00.956
Or maybe your family's life?

04:00.958 --> 04:02.525
No?

04:02.527 --> 04:03.226
No?

04:03.228 --> 04:04.127
Is it worth her life?

04:04.129 --> 04:05.929
No!

04:05.931 --> 04:06.766
Don't!

04:09.767 --> 04:10.902
I got an idea.

04:12.170 --> 04:13.470
Good guy, bad guy.

04:13.472 --> 04:14.640
I got an idea.

04:18.810 --> 04:19.745
You have...

04:21.212 --> 04:23.011
A single shot.

04:23.013 --> 04:24.984
One round, one round.

04:26.051 --> 04:28.551
You think you got all
the fucking answers?

04:28.553 --> 04:31.753
One round, you decide
who lives and who dies.

04:31.755 --> 04:32.989
Please!

04:32.991 --> 04:33.890
Look it...

04:33.892 --> 04:34.991
Why
are you doing this?

04:34.993 --> 04:36.059
So you can be the bad guy!

04:36.061 --> 04:37.227
That's why.

04:37.229 --> 04:39.662
You decide who
lives and who dies.

04:40.866 --> 04:42.064
This one...

04:42.066 --> 04:44.099
God, I would love
to shut her up.

04:44.101 --> 04:44.934
No?

04:44.936 --> 04:45.969
Oh okay.

04:45.971 --> 04:46.802
You will.

04:46.804 --> 04:47.736
Take my life.

04:47.738 --> 04:49.875
Take my life, take my life!

04:51.575 --> 04:52.775
You better...

04:52.777 --> 04:53.243
Take, take my life!

04:53.245 --> 04:54.042
Take his...

04:54.044 --> 04:55.744
Take his, his wife!

04:55.746 --> 04:57.046
His wife he said!

04:57.048 --> 04:57.881
Take his wife!

04:57.883 --> 04:58.648
No!

05:08.092 --> 05:09.092
Fuck you!

05:23.875 --> 05:25.073
Fuck!

05:25.075 --> 05:27.109
Hit it
Trenton, hit it Trenton.

05:33.118 --> 05:35.018
What the fuck?

05:35.020 --> 05:37.052
Hit it
Trenton, hit it Trenton,

05:37.054 --> 05:38.854
hit it Trenton, hit it Trenton.

05:40.926 --> 05:42.792
Aw, look at that.

05:42.794 --> 05:44.126
I'm getting tired
of making other men

05:44.128 --> 05:45.962
look bad, Rogers.

05:45.964 --> 05:47.963
That's hard work baby,
that's all that is.

05:47.965 --> 05:48.998
Hard work.

05:49.000 --> 05:49.866
Try that shit again.

05:49.868 --> 05:53.105
Check
ball baby, let's go.

05:55.739 --> 05:57.106
Take
his cookies, Rogers!

05:57.108 --> 05:59.778
I got
him, I got him.

06:01.012 --> 06:02.014
Hell yeah!

06:06.818 --> 06:09.152
Basketball's a
man's sport, Trenton.

06:09.154 --> 06:10.152
And maybe you shouldn't play.

06:10.154 --> 06:11.854
What?

06:11.856 --> 06:13.922
Maybe I should stop playing
to kick your fucking ass.

06:13.924 --> 06:16.191
Hey,
it's just a game guys.

06:16.193 --> 06:17.926
Let's do that you...

06:21.299 --> 06:23.999
I'm tired of
this bullshit with you man!

06:24.001 --> 06:26.369
That ain't
worth it, relax.

06:26.371 --> 06:28.304
Nice
shot, I woulda pump faked.

06:28.306 --> 06:29.806
I don't wanna hear that, man.

06:29.808 --> 06:31.039
Where the hell was your ass

06:31.041 --> 06:31.974
when I was getting
tackled in mid-air?

06:31.976 --> 06:33.142
I knew you could take him.

06:33.144 --> 06:34.309
Besides, you can't
have me drop everything

06:34.311 --> 06:36.311
come running over.

06:36.313 --> 06:38.047
Thanks a lot, partner.

06:38.049 --> 06:39.248
No problem.

06:39.250 --> 06:41.120
That's why I'm here.

06:42.053 --> 06:45.755
I heard there's a new
position opening up.

06:45.757 --> 06:48.758
Commissioner's leaving
town, headed up to New York.

06:48.760 --> 06:51.294
Rumor has it your name's
in the running for the gig.

06:51.296 --> 06:52.128
Is that right?

06:52.130 --> 06:53.996
Yeah it's right.

06:53.998 --> 06:55.698
I mean come on, brother.

06:55.700 --> 06:57.767
There's no way
I want that job.

06:57.769 --> 07:00.837
And trust me partner, you
don't want that job either.

07:00.839 --> 07:02.237
So what, you're gonna
let Rogers have it?

07:02.239 --> 07:04.941
You've naive, anyone
ever tell you that?

07:04.943 --> 07:07.210
Rogers already has the job.

07:07.212 --> 07:10.078
He's got the right friends
in the right places.

07:10.080 --> 07:11.914
People like me and you...

07:11.916 --> 07:13.215
We don't even get that nod.

07:13.217 --> 07:15.818
And what's people
like me and you?

07:15.820 --> 07:17.156
The good guys.

07:19.858 --> 07:20.957
You know, I bet
he's the one behind

07:20.959 --> 07:24.126
all the evidence going
missing from the locker room.

07:24.128 --> 07:25.695
Who else but him?

07:25.697 --> 07:28.196
And he's gonna get
away with it too.

07:28.198 --> 07:29.234
Shit.

07:30.234 --> 07:31.302
He already has.

07:44.015 --> 07:45.982
All right, everybody.

07:45.984 --> 07:46.818
Settle in.

07:47.986 --> 07:48.820
All right.

07:50.087 --> 07:52.155
Look around, officers.

07:52.157 --> 07:56.124
This is a special group of
men and women we have here.

07:56.126 --> 07:57.926
We have a brand new
division of special agents,

07:57.928 --> 08:01.229
specifically hand selected by me

08:01.231 --> 08:03.165
to patrol Boston once it's dark.

08:03.167 --> 08:06.436
A task that is not
to be taken lightly.

08:06.438 --> 08:09.037
Our precinct loses the
most officers in the state,

08:09.039 --> 08:12.241
and the number rises
every damn year!

08:12.243 --> 08:14.210
These people...

08:14.212 --> 08:15.143
No.

08:15.145 --> 08:17.181
Our people need a savior.

08:19.150 --> 08:21.286
That's exactly what C-11 is.

08:26.724 --> 08:28.890
Bring in the gear.

08:31.161 --> 08:33.028
Knock it off, shut the hell up!

08:33.030 --> 08:34.263
This isn't funny.

08:34.265 --> 08:36.331
This isn't a game.

08:36.332 --> 08:41.037
This gear is not for your
amusement, it's for your life,

08:41.039 --> 08:42.941
it's for your survival.

08:47.145 --> 08:48.176
Now...

08:48.178 --> 08:50.115
This is military grade.

08:52.049 --> 08:55.017
High tech combatant eye wear.

08:55.019 --> 08:56.518
It's equipped with facial
recognition software

08:56.520 --> 08:58.387
embedded to catch
wanted criminals

08:58.389 --> 09:00.757
already in our system.

09:00.759 --> 09:04.930
It also has night vision
and can detect body heat.

09:05.929 --> 09:06.765
Next.

09:08.132 --> 09:09.167
Flak jackets...

09:10.268 --> 09:11.300
With extra armor.

09:11.302 --> 09:12.969
Not only bulletproof,

09:12.971 --> 09:15.370
but designed with more
pockets to allow more room

09:15.372 --> 09:18.009
for ammunition and artillery.

09:22.212 --> 09:25.181
This will definitely
save your life.

09:25.183 --> 09:26.782
GPS voice communicator.

09:26.784 --> 09:30.319
An instant communication
with anyone on the force

09:30.321 --> 09:32.324
within a 24 mile radius.

09:35.326 --> 09:38.194
Ladies and gentlemen...

09:38.196 --> 09:41.163
We have all we
need to go to war.

09:41.165 --> 09:41.999
And win.

09:45.403 --> 09:47.235
We are the night watch,

09:47.237 --> 09:49.305
we are the guardians
of the night.

09:49.307 --> 09:51.807
That dude watches
way too much TV.

09:52.976 --> 09:54.944
Why are you
always the loudest?

09:54.946 --> 09:56.311
And the sweatiest.

09:56.313 --> 09:57.379
Hey, whoa, whoa.

09:57.381 --> 09:59.315
What's all this hostility, man?

09:59.317 --> 10:00.118
Can't a brother live?

10:01.149 --> 10:02.350
Harry, shut your
fat ass up man.

10:04.087 --> 10:07.156
Hey Courtney, you look a
little lonely over there.

10:07.158 --> 10:08.490
You want some company tonight?

10:08.492 --> 10:10.560
I'd rather fuck
fatass over there.

10:10.562 --> 10:11.561
Really?

10:11.563 --> 10:12.427
Really?

10:12.429 --> 10:13.799
Cold as ice.

10:16.500 --> 10:18.367
Hey, listen up.

10:18.369 --> 10:20.873
Eddie, my office, ten minutes.

10:22.273 --> 10:23.442
Trenton, 20.

10:27.411 --> 10:28.845
Somebody's in trouble.

10:28.847 --> 10:30.312
What the hell's
that all about?

10:30.314 --> 10:31.113
I hear the chief brought
in some heavy hitters

10:31.115 --> 10:32.281
from internal affairs.

10:32.283 --> 10:34.182
A hundred and fifty thousand
just vanished overnight.

10:34.184 --> 10:35.383
We don't need
an investigation,

10:35.385 --> 10:37.286
all they gotta do is
look in Rogers desk.

10:37.288 --> 10:38.454
Yo Trent.

10:38.456 --> 10:40.956
Break into that bitch, let's
see what's really in there!

10:40.958 --> 10:42.425
You see, that's the
shit I'm talking about.

10:42.427 --> 10:43.292
What?

10:43.294 --> 10:44.359
Why I gotta go
check the man's desk?

10:44.361 --> 10:45.393
Cause I'm black?

10:45.395 --> 10:46.595
Dude, I'm black too!

10:46.597 --> 10:48.263
So then you take
your ass and go do it!

10:48.265 --> 10:50.199
All right guys,
enjoy the night off.

10:50.201 --> 10:51.933
We're gonna get moving, big boy.

10:51.935 --> 10:53.235
Hey, hey, hey.

10:53.237 --> 10:54.369
Be careful out there
huh, it's dangerous.

10:54.371 --> 10:55.872
Save it, loverboy.

10:55.874 --> 10:58.110
This is not my first rodeo.

10:59.209 --> 11:00.375
Get your shit
together, we gotta go.

11:00.377 --> 11:03.446
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think
she gets it from her Aunt...

11:03.448 --> 11:04.379
Oh, look.

11:05.549 --> 11:06.916
How are you?

11:06.918 --> 11:09.284
Fantastic, I am so proud.

11:09.286 --> 11:10.386
I know, she did a great job.

11:10.388 --> 11:11.354
Oh yes.

11:11.356 --> 11:12.321
How you doing man?

11:12.323 --> 11:13.489
Good man, how are you?

11:13.491 --> 11:15.191
Not bad, ain't
seen you in a minute.

11:15.193 --> 11:15.992
I know man, it's been a
while, it's good to see you.

11:15.994 --> 11:17.125
You're looking good.

11:17.127 --> 11:17.926
Thank you brother,
you as well.

11:17.928 --> 11:18.527
How you doing buddy?

11:18.529 --> 11:19.896
Hey second son.

11:22.567 --> 11:23.398
Hey Isabella.

11:23.400 --> 11:24.432
Hi.

11:24.434 --> 11:25.268
How you doing?

11:25.270 --> 11:26.201
I'm doing good.

11:26.203 --> 11:26.969
Yeah.

11:26.971 --> 11:28.003
How's Dash?

11:28.005 --> 11:29.004
He's doing good.

11:29.006 --> 11:31.072
Still a cute little kitty?

11:31.074 --> 11:32.340
Running around all
over the place?

11:32.342 --> 11:33.475
Yeah, how's Zeke?

11:33.477 --> 11:34.944
Zeke's doing good.

11:34.946 --> 11:36.479
He likes to run too.

11:36.481 --> 11:37.312
That's what dogs do.

11:37.314 --> 11:39.382
That's what dogs do.

11:39.384 --> 11:41.017
Is Dash really fast,
can you catch him?

11:41.019 --> 11:41.950
Yeah, no.

11:41.952 --> 11:42.551
No?

11:43.954 --> 11:46.154
Isabella, get over here.

11:46.156 --> 11:49.260
See you later.

11:50.495 --> 11:51.560
Guess who?

11:51.562 --> 11:53.028
Whoa, I hope it's
someone who knows

11:53.030 --> 11:55.064
not to sneak up on
a dangerous man.

11:55.066 --> 11:56.132
Grey, you're not dangerous,

11:56.134 --> 11:57.233
you're just about as dangerous

11:57.235 --> 12:00.101
as that stupid goldfish you
got me when I turned 16.

12:00.103 --> 12:01.137
Again with the goldfish.

12:01.139 --> 12:02.370
Again with the goldfish,

12:02.372 --> 12:03.439
you're never gonna
live that down,

12:03.441 --> 12:05.340
it was the worst gift
anyone has ever given to me.

12:05.342 --> 12:06.474
No, no, no, I
can't accept that,

12:06.476 --> 12:07.676
there's no way it's the worst,

12:07.678 --> 12:09.644
what about the comic
books I got you

12:09.646 --> 12:10.713
the last year for Christmas?

12:10.715 --> 12:12.148
Right, the comic books

12:12.150 --> 12:13.449
mixed in with the
porno magazines,

12:13.451 --> 12:15.618
that was really fantastic.

12:15.620 --> 12:16.585
Still not as bad
as the goldfish.

12:16.587 --> 12:17.686
Congratulations, Farrah.

12:17.688 --> 12:18.620
Thank you.

12:18.622 --> 12:20.122
You're welcome.

12:20.124 --> 12:21.456
I forgot I bought
the two together.

12:21.458 --> 12:23.091
Oh, well...

12:23.093 --> 12:24.627
You still got 'em?

12:24.629 --> 12:26.061
Are you serious?

12:26.063 --> 12:26.696
Really, Grey?

12:26.698 --> 12:28.129
No.

12:28.131 --> 12:29.598
Oh come on, we'll
get you a girlfriend.

12:29.600 --> 12:30.532
So many nice girls here.

12:30.534 --> 12:31.734
You don't need to, no, no, no,

12:31.736 --> 12:33.268
you don't need to
find me a girlfriend.

12:33.270 --> 12:34.202
But if you really wanna help,

12:34.204 --> 12:34.737
you know what you can do?

12:34.739 --> 12:35.571
What?

12:35.573 --> 12:36.973
Find me a beer.

12:38.409 --> 12:39.240
It's not a joke.

12:39.242 --> 12:42.043
Here come on,
come meet Patrick.

12:42.045 --> 12:43.412
What, what?

12:43.414 --> 12:45.147
Let's go meet Patrick.

12:45.149 --> 12:46.415
Yeah, he really
wants you guys to like him.

12:46.417 --> 12:48.249
Come on, come on, for me.

12:48.251 --> 12:49.484
Fine, fine.

12:49.486 --> 12:50.386
For me,
thank you, thank you.

12:53.091 --> 12:55.193
Thank you all for coming.

12:58.663 --> 12:59.498
So...

13:01.098 --> 13:05.368
I started this journey
into law school because...

13:05.370 --> 13:06.171
I was tired.

13:07.472 --> 13:10.439
I was tired of walking
down the street

13:10.441 --> 13:12.774
and worrying about
what dangers await me

13:12.776 --> 13:14.409
when I got home.

13:14.411 --> 13:17.446
I was tired of turning on the TV

13:17.448 --> 13:20.117
and seeing a criminal that
deserves to be locked up

13:21.149 --> 13:22.151
get set free because
of a fucked up system.

13:22.153 --> 13:23.185
Farrah!

13:23.187 --> 13:24.423
Watch your mouth.

13:25.490 --> 13:26.325
Okay.

13:27.158 --> 13:27.790
Sorry.

13:27.792 --> 13:29.425
Sorry kids.

13:29.427 --> 13:33.329
Well, she's going out
into the real world now.

13:33.331 --> 13:36.264
This is when you really
gotta start worrying.

13:36.266 --> 13:38.133
She's got a good
head on her shoulders,

13:38.135 --> 13:40.572
it's what scares me the most.

13:42.039 --> 13:44.572
If there's one person I
want on my team, it's her.

13:44.574 --> 13:46.709
I think she's really
gonna make a difference.

13:46.711 --> 13:48.811
She already has.

13:48.813 --> 13:50.779
Just want her to be safe.

13:50.781 --> 13:53.648
Trenton, you know there's
nowhere safe in Boston.

13:53.650 --> 13:56.654
The night brings
out all the demons.

13:58.423 --> 14:00.156
My brother Trenton.

14:00.158 --> 14:01.159
He is a cop.

14:03.593 --> 14:07.396
And he and his partner
risk their lives

14:07.398 --> 14:10.769
every day so we can
have moments like this.

14:12.770 --> 14:15.439
So we can live our lives, right?

14:16.506 --> 14:18.206
And...

14:18.208 --> 14:21.277
They work so hard to bring
in a criminal and book him,

14:21.279 --> 14:23.515
and then have him just leave?

14:25.482 --> 14:27.117
And that's not fair, right?

14:28.149 --> 14:28.484
That's not right.

14:28.486 --> 14:29.718
It's not the way it should be,

14:29.720 --> 14:32.524
and I'm not going
to stand for it.

14:37.361 --> 14:41.533
I don't wanna bring my child
into a world like this.

14:43.134 --> 14:43.769
So...

14:45.870 --> 14:49.341
You bring them in,
and I will make sure

14:50.408 --> 14:52.177
that they stay there.

14:53.577 --> 14:54.413
Cheers.

14:55.880 --> 14:59.348
Congratulations on
both your bits of news.

14:59.350 --> 15:01.484
Thanks mom, thank you.

15:01.486 --> 15:03.451
Okay, so which one's from you?

15:03.453 --> 15:04.386
This one.

15:04.388 --> 15:05.321
Come on, it's the purple one.

15:05.323 --> 15:05.787
Purple one, right?

15:07.757 --> 15:08.724
Mommy...

15:08.726 --> 15:10.758
Oh my goodness, you kept them?

15:10.760 --> 15:12.228
Did you actually
play with these?

15:12.230 --> 15:13.428
I used to love these,

15:13.430 --> 15:14.662
I used to play with
these every day.

15:14.664 --> 15:16.599
And now you can teach
them to somebody new.

15:16.601 --> 15:19.167
Yes, my baby's having a baby.

15:19.169 --> 15:20.469
Your baby's having a what?

15:20.471 --> 15:23.239
You're gonna be an uncle.

15:23.241 --> 15:24.507
Farrah...

15:24.509 --> 15:25.541
You're pregnant?

15:25.543 --> 15:26.474
- Yeah.
- You didn't tell him?

15:26.476 --> 15:27.276
You were supposed to tell him.

15:27.278 --> 15:28.511
I was supposed to?

15:28.513 --> 15:29.446
Yes, you
said you would...

15:29.448 --> 15:30.446
You're
pregnant with his kid?

15:30.448 --> 15:31.247
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

15:31.249 --> 15:32.348
Yes, yes, it's...

15:32.350 --> 15:34.249
What the hell is wrong
with you man, I told you!

15:34.251 --> 15:35.518
Get the hell off of me!

15:35.520 --> 15:37.552
What the hell are you
doing with my sister?

15:37.554 --> 15:39.555
She just graduated law school!

15:39.557 --> 15:40.556
You're gonna knock her up?

15:40.558 --> 15:41.757
Now listen...

15:41.759 --> 15:43.224
I wanted to be the
one to tell you okay,

15:43.226 --> 15:44.159
so if you're gonna
be mad at anyone,

15:44.161 --> 15:46.628
just be mad at me, all right?

15:46.630 --> 15:48.464
But man to man I'm
coming to you now

15:48.466 --> 15:50.899
because I respect you,
I respect your family...

15:50.901 --> 15:54.702
Ms. Higgins, all right, and
I'm gonna marry your sister

15:54.704 --> 15:57.605
and she's gonna
bear my children.

15:59.843 --> 16:01.645
Wait, wait, wait.

16:03.280 --> 16:07.182
Trent, I promise you if
you give him one chance

16:07.184 --> 16:08.686
he is so charming.

16:09.953 --> 16:11.753
I doubt it, Farrah.

16:11.755 --> 16:14.590
You've been dating the dude
for what, three months now?

16:14.592 --> 16:16.691
You barely know him.

16:16.693 --> 16:17.625
I love him.

16:17.627 --> 16:18.761
You love him?

16:18.763 --> 16:19.598
I do.

16:20.798 --> 16:23.632
Farrah, what is it
about this kid, huh?

16:23.634 --> 16:24.899
Is he a basketball player?

16:24.901 --> 16:26.435
He can't be, he's
short as all hell.

16:27.837 --> 16:29.404
What, does he got
money, family got money?

16:29.406 --> 16:30.239
What is it?

16:30.241 --> 16:30.873
No, no.

16:30.875 --> 16:32.144
He is driven.

16:34.712 --> 16:36.148
It's important.

16:37.747 --> 16:39.415
It is important but
I still don't like him.

16:41.318 --> 16:44.253
Look, I need to
ask you a favor.

16:44.255 --> 16:44.920
Stop.

16:44.922 --> 16:45.753
Trenton, come on.

16:45.755 --> 16:46.622
What is it, Farrah?

16:46.624 --> 16:48.257
Okay, um...

16:48.259 --> 16:48.891
Don't get mad.

16:48.893 --> 16:49.724
What is it, Farrah?

16:49.726 --> 16:51.259
Don't get mad.

16:51.261 --> 16:52.795
Patrick works at
the Mayor's office.

16:52.797 --> 16:53.628
Jesus Christ, Farrah.

16:53.630 --> 16:55.330
Stop.

16:55.332 --> 16:57.666
He says he's gonna get a new
job but he can't find one

16:57.668 --> 16:59.734
and I feel like he's meeting
a lot of the wrong people.

16:59.736 --> 17:00.572
Farrah.

17:01.738 --> 17:03.638
That man stands
against everything

17:03.640 --> 17:05.944
that we fight for, everything.

17:07.377 --> 17:08.243
You understand that?

17:08.246 --> 17:08.880
I know.

17:10.448 --> 17:13.749
But that's why I gotta
come to you, right?

17:13.751 --> 17:14.953
Just help me out.

17:16.853 --> 17:19.454
Patrick cannot work at the
Mayor's office anymore.

17:19.457 --> 17:23.361
You put yourself in
this predicament, Farrah.

17:24.594 --> 17:25.761
Come on.

17:25.762 --> 17:26.794
You're smarter than that.

17:26.796 --> 17:27.631
I know.

17:28.632 --> 17:29.467
Look.

17:31.669 --> 17:32.834
Just help me out, okay?

17:32.836 --> 17:34.436
You know I'd do
anything for you.

17:34.438 --> 17:35.273
Okay.

17:36.673 --> 17:40.344
You don't have to like him,
just gotta respect him.

17:42.479 --> 17:45.648
Let me know by the
end of the week, okay?

17:45.650 --> 17:46.484
Yeah.

17:48.718 --> 17:49.720
Thank you.

17:51.022 --> 17:51.853
Bring it in.

17:51.855 --> 17:52.821
All right.

17:54.659 --> 17:55.690
Be safe, okay?

17:55.692 --> 17:56.527
I will.

17:59.729 --> 18:01.496
Jesus.

18:01.498 --> 18:02.564
Jesus.

18:02.566 --> 18:04.366
We should probably leave
before you shoot him.

18:04.368 --> 18:06.371
Take it easy, will ya?

18:07.638 --> 18:10.708
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey.

19:14.839 --> 19:15.840
Mr. Mayor.

19:21.544 --> 19:22.380
Mr. Mayor.

19:27.717 --> 19:29.650
Look, it's already past one
o'clock we're running late,

19:29.652 --> 19:31.890
so we really gotta get going.

19:34.758 --> 19:35.759
Mr. Mayor...

19:38.027 --> 19:39.061
Listen, I don't...

19:39.063 --> 19:39.895
Let's go.

19:39.897 --> 19:41.562
What?

19:41.564 --> 19:42.598
Boss wants
to see you, let's go.

19:42.600 --> 19:44.002
What do you mean?

19:45.835 --> 19:47.002
Fucking Patrick.

19:47.004 --> 19:47.869
Patrick!

19:47.871 --> 19:49.605
Yes?

19:49.607 --> 19:50.539
Did I not ask you
to keep an eye on the clock?

19:50.541 --> 19:51.674
I tried to tell you...

19:51.676 --> 19:54.475
Did I not ask you to not
let me lose track of time?

19:54.477 --> 19:57.044
What's the matter with you?

19:57.046 --> 19:58.813
Fucking useless worm.

19:58.815 --> 19:59.747
Can I have the jacket please?

19:59.749 --> 20:00.919
Now, let's go!

20:03.888 --> 20:05.186
Unbelievable.

20:05.188 --> 20:07.859
This kid's unfuckingbelieveable.

20:08.993 --> 20:10.626
Thank you sir, thank you.

20:10.628 --> 20:11.526
Let's go.

20:11.528 --> 20:12.896
Come on, come on.

20:15.765 --> 20:16.767
Jeez Louise.

20:17.967 --> 20:19.901
Can you fucking
step on it please?

20:19.903 --> 20:22.137
You get over in that
lane, all right?

20:22.139 --> 20:23.772
Christ.

20:23.774 --> 20:24.907
This fucking piece of shit,

20:24.909 --> 20:26.007
could it go any faster?

20:26.944 --> 20:28.744
Got some place to be, man.

20:28.746 --> 20:31.914
It's him, he wants to
know why you're late.

20:31.916 --> 20:33.048
Yeah, fuck him.

20:33.050 --> 20:34.750
All right?

20:34.752 --> 20:35.650
I'm the God damn Mayor right?

20:35.652 --> 20:38.454
Nothing happens until
I get there, right?

20:38.456 --> 20:40.555
Am I right guys?

20:40.557 --> 20:43.125
Damn it, step on it, let's go!

20:43.127 --> 20:44.959
Mayor, what
is Stanton Creed's...

20:50.467 --> 20:51.934
Unemployment rate
has more than doubled

20:51.936 --> 20:52.901
since you took office,

20:52.903 --> 20:54.469
allowing big business
to pay their employees

20:54.471 --> 20:56.638
next to nothing without
answering to anyone.

20:56.640 --> 20:57.840
What is your
administration doing

20:57.842 --> 20:58.807
to remedy this situation?

20:58.809 --> 21:00.175
We have a five point program

21:00.177 --> 21:02.677
that deals with that
issue primarily.

21:02.679 --> 21:03.846
I have always stood behind,

21:03.848 --> 21:08.750
and I will continue to stand
by hard working Bostonians

21:08.752 --> 21:12.087
that have been forced to
accept these unlawful wages

21:12.089 --> 21:13.589
due to the current job market.

21:13.591 --> 21:14.822
Next question?

21:14.824 --> 21:16.157
Mr. Mayor,
Mr. Mayor, Mr. Mayor?

21:16.159 --> 21:17.658
Are you
aware that Stanton Creed

21:17.660 --> 21:20.061
is linked to multiple
accusations of murder,

21:20.063 --> 21:23.264
hostile intimidation,
blackmail and fraud?

21:23.266 --> 21:24.933
No.

21:24.935 --> 21:25.734
Mr. Mayor,
what is your relationship

21:25.736 --> 21:26.968
with Stanton Creed?

21:26.970 --> 21:28.203
Stanton Creed is
an innocent man.

21:28.205 --> 21:29.040
Who...

21:30.140 --> 21:34.076
You guys, your media
syndicates have this evil plan

21:34.078 --> 21:36.043
to tarnish his good name?

21:36.045 --> 21:38.513
I mean, we stand by a
saying here in Boston,

21:38.515 --> 21:39.281
maybe you've heard of it...

21:39.283 --> 21:40.983
Innocent until proven guilty,

21:40.985 --> 21:44.887
and Mr. Creed has never been
found guilty of anything,

21:44.889 --> 21:47.054
he's never even been arrested,

21:47.056 --> 21:47.923
so will you please...

21:47.925 --> 21:48.991
Mr. Mayor...

21:52.963 --> 21:55.531
Mayor has
no further comments.

21:55.533 --> 21:56.264
No.

21:56.266 --> 21:58.000
Only the Mayor.

21:58.002 --> 21:58.934
Really?

21:58.936 --> 22:00.538
Just the Mayor.

22:01.906 --> 22:03.138
All right, guys...

22:03.140 --> 22:07.010
Break for lunch, I'll see you
back at the office, all right?

22:15.686 --> 22:18.089
You're late, Mayor.

22:21.958 --> 22:22.960
I'm sorry.

22:24.161 --> 22:27.329
I had a crazy morning, look,
there was terrible traffic...

22:27.331 --> 22:28.696
It takes a while to get across...

22:28.698 --> 22:30.064
Nobody is interested
in your excuses,

22:30.066 --> 22:33.237
cause the fact is
you are late, again.

22:35.038 --> 22:36.907
I'm sorry.

22:39.810 --> 22:42.043
Water under the bridge.

22:42.045 --> 22:43.914
Let's talk business.

22:45.682 --> 22:48.085
Come on, let's talk business.

22:52.989 --> 22:54.791
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

22:56.092 --> 22:58.563
Nobody told you to sit down.

23:03.833 --> 23:05.833
So you expect me
to just stand here

23:05.835 --> 23:09.039
and watch you eat
while we talk business?

23:14.143 --> 23:16.945
Put your hand on the table.

23:16.947 --> 23:18.983
Come on, Stanton.

23:21.317 --> 23:24.021
Put your hands on the table.

23:27.390 --> 23:29.858
Look, I said I was sorry,
we was caught in traffic man.

23:29.860 --> 23:32.894
Right,
I know, I heard you.

23:32.896 --> 23:33.995
Put your hands on the table,

23:33.997 --> 23:35.999
don't make me ask again.

23:37.634 --> 23:40.068
Can't we just talk, let's
have a conversation, all right?

23:40.070 --> 23:42.307
Let's move on with the day.

23:45.042 --> 23:46.174
Come on, can't we...

23:46.176 --> 23:48.746
Put them on the fucking table!

24:09.867 --> 24:11.099
You're fucking wack!

24:11.101 --> 24:13.435
Anybody wanna clean
this fucking blood up?

24:13.437 --> 24:16.040
This place is a fucking mess.

24:25.716 --> 24:28.716
You know what's
amazing, Mr. Mayor...

24:28.718 --> 24:32.890
How different Boston is when
the sun starts to go down.

24:34.158 --> 24:36.925
The air starts to change,

24:36.927 --> 24:38.062
and the smell...

24:39.729 --> 24:41.899
Gradually changes with it.

24:44.701 --> 24:49.071
Blood, Mr. Mayor, blood
has a very unique smell.

24:49.073 --> 24:53.175
That is what Boston
smells like at night.

24:53.177 --> 24:54.712
Blood, and fear.

24:57.246 --> 25:00.081
And that is what
drives them crazy.

25:00.083 --> 25:03.284
The very toxic but
addicting smell

25:03.286 --> 25:06.420
of human blood and fear,
and can you blame them?

25:06.422 --> 25:07.923
Can you?

25:07.925 --> 25:09.724
If your home smells of booze,

25:09.726 --> 25:11.225
and you invite an
alcoholic over,

25:11.227 --> 25:14.865
could you blame them
for craving alcohol?

25:16.365 --> 25:17.200
No.

25:18.267 --> 25:19.501
Boston, Mr. Mayor...

25:19.503 --> 25:23.041
Boston has its share
of wolves, and sheep,

25:24.073 --> 25:25.243
who fall prey.

25:26.209 --> 25:28.979
That's just the
world we live in.

25:29.813 --> 25:30.982
And I love it.

25:34.284 --> 25:36.350
Have a drink, Mayor.

25:36.352 --> 25:37.185
Mon ami.

25:37.187 --> 25:38.219
No?

25:38.221 --> 25:39.154
No.

25:39.156 --> 25:42.290
Oh that's right, I forgot...

25:42.292 --> 25:43.127
Fuck!

25:44.428 --> 25:45.827
What is your problem, Creed?

25:45.829 --> 25:47.763
You know, you are wack.

25:47.765 --> 25:50.064
You are certifiably wack,

25:50.066 --> 25:53.267
you're rambling, I don't
know what you want,

25:53.269 --> 25:57.004
just tell me what you want
from me and let me go.

25:57.006 --> 25:57.842
Please.

25:58.842 --> 26:01.176
Oh, don't you fucking
worry, I'll let you go.

26:01.178 --> 26:04.111
I will let you go
when I make my point.

26:04.113 --> 26:06.183
Which is this, Mr. Mayor.

26:09.319 --> 26:12.154
I bought you that
seat in that office,

26:12.156 --> 26:14.321
and I paid for you to keep it.

26:14.323 --> 26:17.294
Don't you forget who
fucking owns you!

26:19.162 --> 26:20.995
God damn it,
what is your problem,

26:20.997 --> 26:22.196
what do you want from me?

26:22.198 --> 26:23.130
I'll tell you what I want.

26:23.132 --> 26:24.331
Creed, just let me go.

26:24.333 --> 26:26.267
Tell me what you
want and let me go.

26:26.269 --> 26:28.003
Shut up and listen!

26:28.005 --> 26:29.170
Listen.

26:29.172 --> 26:30.906
Are you listening?

26:30.908 --> 26:32.874
I make a fucking
call, you pick it up.

26:32.876 --> 26:34.141
Okay.

26:34.143 --> 26:35.577
I tell you what
to do, you do it.

26:35.579 --> 26:37.048
Okay!

26:40.851 --> 26:44.186
There is gonna come
a time, Mr. Mayor,

26:44.188 --> 26:46.221
where I need you
and your position

26:46.223 --> 26:49.057
to make sure that I stay in
my position and trust me,

26:49.059 --> 26:50.859
you do not wanna
make the wrong choice

26:50.861 --> 26:51.493
when that time comes.

26:51.495 --> 26:52.561
I won't, Creed.

26:52.563 --> 26:54.196
But you said it, you need me.

26:54.198 --> 26:55.967
Shut the fuck up!

26:58.134 --> 27:02.036
Enough with you,
it's enough, get out.

27:02.038 --> 27:02.873
Get out!

27:22.226 --> 27:23.524
I don't even
understand why you listen to it,

27:23.526 --> 27:25.359
it's just a dumb song.

27:25.361 --> 27:26.128
It's
catchy as hell, man.

27:26.130 --> 27:27.262
Hey,
because it's catchy

27:27.264 --> 27:28.929
that doesn't mean it's good.

27:28.931 --> 27:30.999
You know, the songs these
kids come up with nowadays, bro.

27:32.268 --> 27:34.569
♪ The Bootyburg, the Bootyburg

27:34.571 --> 27:37.105
♪ I'll take you to the Bootyburg

27:40.944 --> 27:42.276
Go head, Dispatch.

27:46.149 --> 27:46.982
I hate that place.

27:46.984 --> 27:48.215
It ain't that bad.

27:48.217 --> 27:49.317
- It is that bad.
- It's not that bad.

27:49.319 --> 27:50.551
- It's the Burg.
- It is that bad.

27:50.553 --> 27:51.485
Yeah it's the Burg, it
ain't the Bootyburg.

27:51.487 --> 27:52.454
Dispatch, Trenton here.

27:52.456 --> 27:55.259
Grey and I are on the way over.

27:57.226 --> 27:58.426
It's catchy, I told you.

27:58.428 --> 28:00.427
We're not going
to the Bootyburg.

28:00.429 --> 28:01.431
Bootyburg.

28:20.249 --> 28:24.151
Hey Dispatch, what was the
name of that location again?

28:24.153 --> 28:24.988
Dispatch.

28:28.525 --> 28:29.360
Dispatch.

28:31.995 --> 28:33.461
Fuck.

28:33.463 --> 28:35.166
Bad news is close.

28:36.332 --> 28:37.499
They always block our
radio transmissions

28:37.501 --> 28:40.037
when they know we're around.

28:42.538 --> 28:43.440
Dispatch.

28:46.944 --> 28:48.111
You all right?

28:53.115 --> 28:54.315
Hey, you all right?

28:54.317 --> 28:56.083
Help.

28:56.085 --> 28:58.154
Hey, hey you all right?

29:01.958 --> 29:02.590
You all right?

29:02.592 --> 29:04.428
No.

29:11.200 --> 29:12.399
Die motherfucker!

29:17.373 --> 29:19.175
Come on, come on.

29:24.480 --> 29:26.046
Fuck.

29:26.048 --> 29:26.982
How many are out there?

29:26.984 --> 29:28.183
There's about six of them.

29:28.185 --> 29:29.283
All right, you're
gonna have to cover me.

29:29.285 --> 29:30.118
Cover you?

29:30.120 --> 29:30.752
Yeah, cover me.

29:30.754 --> 29:32.454
Grey, don't be dumb.

29:32.456 --> 29:33.687
We need to wait for backup,

29:33.689 --> 29:34.488
there's too many
of them out there.

29:34.490 --> 29:35.756
I need to get the car.

29:35.758 --> 29:37.458
Grey, fuck you that's
an order, you stay here.

29:37.460 --> 29:39.526
Don't do anything stupid.

29:39.528 --> 29:40.361
Cover me.

29:40.363 --> 29:41.428
Grey, Grey!

29:47.371 --> 29:49.236
Dispatch, Grey!

29:49.238 --> 29:50.571
Welcome to the
party motherfuckers!

29:53.142 --> 29:54.077
Dispatch!

29:56.412 --> 29:58.480
Officer under fire in the
corner of Blue and Seaver.

29:58.482 --> 29:59.580
Officer under fire!

30:02.486 --> 30:03.551
Grey!

30:03.553 --> 30:05.320
Fuck, Grey!

30:39.288 --> 30:40.357
Fucking shit.

30:52.436 --> 30:54.135
I'm ready to party!

31:46.622 --> 31:47.655
Hey.

31:47.657 --> 31:48.490
Oh, look at you.

31:49.758 --> 31:51.394
You look amazing.

31:53.263 --> 31:54.529
Thank you.

31:54.531 --> 31:55.362
Mister...

31:55.364 --> 31:56.630
New suit.

31:56.632 --> 31:58.699
Yeah, I just picked
it up today for tonight.

31:58.701 --> 31:59.667
Nice.

31:59.669 --> 32:01.503
How's Trenton doing?

32:01.505 --> 32:02.570
He's good.

32:02.572 --> 32:03.471
Yeah?

32:03.473 --> 32:05.506
Yeah, no, he's
better, he is better...

32:05.508 --> 32:06.674
Okay.

32:06.676 --> 32:07.675
Back to his
normal, bossy self.

32:07.677 --> 32:08.542
Oh, classic Trenton.

32:08.544 --> 32:09.878
Classic Trenton.

32:11.547 --> 32:13.348
Look, I know things have
been really stressful lately,

32:13.350 --> 32:16.384
but I want you to know tonight
is just about you and I,

32:16.386 --> 32:17.619
and our future.

32:17.621 --> 32:18.453
All right?

32:18.455 --> 32:19.686
Okay.

32:19.688 --> 32:21.488
And celebrating
Trenton's recovery.

32:21.490 --> 32:23.724
And we can pick baby names.

32:23.726 --> 32:25.392
So you're gonna make
me cancel this dinner.

32:25.394 --> 32:28.196
Oh, I'm gonna make you cancel
this big fancy dinner that...

32:28.198 --> 32:30.665
Okay, hey, hey shh.

32:30.667 --> 32:33.534
That's not really
something I want overheard.

32:33.536 --> 32:34.569
All right?

32:34.571 --> 32:35.602
Okay.

32:35.604 --> 32:37.237
But...

32:37.239 --> 32:39.340
I think you're really gonna
like this place, so...

32:39.342 --> 32:40.574
Just wait and see.

32:40.576 --> 32:42.609
All right.

32:42.611 --> 32:44.448
All right, let's go.

32:50.553 --> 32:51.552
Fucking bitch.

32:51.554 --> 32:53.724
Oh yes, fuck me.

32:55.691 --> 32:57.724
Oh, you fucking whore.

33:07.637 --> 33:08.636
Right there!

33:17.546 --> 33:18.381
Oh yeah.

33:19.983 --> 33:20.818
Oh fuck.

33:25.889 --> 33:27.589
Enough!

33:27.591 --> 33:28.425
Enough.

33:29.426 --> 33:30.427
God damn it.

33:31.628 --> 33:33.727
Haven't you have your fill?

33:35.931 --> 33:37.732
Have I had my fill?

33:37.734 --> 33:38.666
Yes.

33:38.668 --> 33:40.968
Um, well, like...

33:40.970 --> 33:42.403
Enough is enough.

33:42.405 --> 33:43.507
No, no, no.

33:44.673 --> 33:45.505
I'm the Mayor!

33:45.507 --> 33:47.442
I'll tell you when
I've had enough.

33:47.444 --> 33:48.642
You see I'm busy here,

33:48.644 --> 33:50.378
don't just fucking come in.

33:50.380 --> 33:51.411
Now good night.

33:51.413 --> 33:52.347
Mayor...

33:52.349 --> 33:53.548
Close the door behind you.

33:53.550 --> 33:54.683
Go!

33:54.685 --> 33:55.917
Don't just come in here,
I'm in a meeting, all right?

33:55.919 --> 33:56.751
Good night.

33:56.753 --> 33:57.985
You disgust me.

33:57.987 --> 34:00.254
You're relieved,
good, I disgust you.

34:00.256 --> 34:01.923
Fuck you, cunt.

34:01.925 --> 34:02.927
God damn it.

34:04.561 --> 34:05.693
Can't get any good help.

34:05.695 --> 34:06.961
Oh...

34:06.963 --> 34:09.463
I can get good help, can't I?

34:09.465 --> 34:10.563
Where's my baby?

34:10.565 --> 34:11.399
I'm right here, baby.

34:11.400 --> 34:12.331
Come back.

34:12.333 --> 34:13.800
Come back to daddy.

34:13.802 --> 34:14.635
Yeah.

34:14.637 --> 34:15.637
Baby.

34:15.639 --> 34:17.504
Are you serious?

34:17.505 --> 34:18.572
Patrick...

34:18.574 --> 34:20.341
That's like the 20th time
you looked over there.

34:20.342 --> 34:21.007
No it's not.

34:21.010 --> 34:22.542
Yes it is.

34:22.543 --> 34:23.710
Is there another pair of
tits you're looking at?

34:23.713 --> 34:24.745
Really?

34:24.746 --> 34:25.679
Yeah.

34:25.681 --> 34:26.414
No, not at all, not at all.

34:27.717 --> 34:29.617
I'm just...

34:29.619 --> 34:31.717
Waiting for my destiny to come
walking through that door.

34:31.719 --> 34:32.719
What?

34:32.722 --> 34:33.820
Your destiny?

34:33.822 --> 34:34.655
Yeah.

34:34.657 --> 34:35.489
Really?

34:35.492 --> 34:36.724
Yeah.

34:36.726 --> 34:37.556
This guy we're waiting
for is more important

34:37.559 --> 34:38.760
than your pregnant
soon-to-be wife?

34:38.762 --> 34:40.661
I wouldn't say
all that, but...

34:40.664 --> 34:42.062
Okay.

34:42.063 --> 34:43.797
Okay, he's here.

34:43.800 --> 34:44.630
What, who's here?

34:44.632 --> 34:45.766
No, no,
no, play it cool,

34:45.768 --> 34:47.668
play it cool, play it cool.

34:47.670 --> 34:48.803
Patrick, that's Stanton Creed.

34:48.804 --> 34:49.803
I know, right?

34:49.804 --> 34:51.705
Patrick, we can't be here.

34:51.706 --> 34:54.475
He steals, he kills people,
fucking gets away with it.

34:54.476 --> 34:55.708
Farrah, calm
down okay, please.

34:55.710 --> 34:56.643
What do
you mean calm down?

34:56.646 --> 34:57.678
Don't ruin this for me.

34:57.680 --> 34:59.479
Ruin this for you?

34:59.481 --> 35:00.747
What do you mean?

35:00.749 --> 35:01.783
Are you serious?

35:01.785 --> 35:02.749
We can't stay here.

35:02.751 --> 35:03.850
Look, if this is the kind of man

35:03.852 --> 35:04.684
that you're trying to impress,

35:04.686 --> 35:06.521
I don't wanna fucking
be here, okay?

35:06.523 --> 35:07.454
We're not
going anywhere, okay?

35:07.456 --> 35:07.988
We're leaving.

35:07.990 --> 35:09.423
No we're not.

35:09.425 --> 35:10.691
Come
on, we're leaving.

35:10.693 --> 35:11.358
I'm not leaving, this
is the only opportunity

35:11.360 --> 35:11.959
that I have.

35:11.961 --> 35:13.428
I'm going, okay?

35:13.430 --> 35:14.329
I'm leaving.

35:14.331 --> 35:14.928
- Farrah, sit...
- Shut up.

35:14.930 --> 35:15.896
Farrah, sit down.

35:15.898 --> 35:17.597
Sit down.

35:17.599 --> 35:19.767
I don't think your lady
friend likes that very much.

35:19.769 --> 35:20.771
Mr. Creed.

35:23.807 --> 35:26.410
I'm sorry, I wasn't thinking.

35:27.443 --> 35:29.577
Everything okay?

35:29.579 --> 35:30.678
You don't need to
be concerned about me,

35:30.680 --> 35:32.579
you need to be concerned
about all those dead bodies

35:32.581 --> 35:33.448
you have popping
up around the city.

35:33.450 --> 35:34.082
Whoa.

35:34.918 --> 35:37.551
The balls on this one.

35:37.553 --> 35:39.820
These black ones are fiery,
I like that, like that.

35:39.822 --> 35:41.988
It's a real honor
to finally meet you.

35:41.990 --> 35:44.459
I'm actually the one who
reserved this table for you,

35:44.461 --> 35:46.861
and I picked out
the wine as well.

35:46.863 --> 35:48.065
It's a good year.

35:50.633 --> 35:51.566
It's a good wine.

35:51.568 --> 35:52.834
Thank you.

35:52.836 --> 35:53.934
You work for the Mayor?

35:53.936 --> 35:55.836
Yeah, I do actually.

35:55.838 --> 35:56.771
But honestly, I
gotta tell you...

35:56.773 --> 36:00.408
I would much prefer
to be working for you.

36:00.410 --> 36:03.077
He's not the type of person
who should be idolized.

36:03.079 --> 36:04.711
I'm sorry Farrah, please...

36:04.713 --> 36:05.912
Just keep your
comments to yourself.

36:05.914 --> 36:06.916
It's okay.

36:08.117 --> 36:10.885
I wouldn't wanna work
for the Mayor either.

36:10.887 --> 36:13.854
But the good news is,
the Mayor works for me.

36:13.856 --> 36:14.856
So, so do you.

36:14.858 --> 36:15.789
Excuse me.

36:15.791 --> 36:18.027
Can we get the check please?

36:20.697 --> 36:21.995
The check, two please.

36:21.997 --> 36:23.830
Whenever you get the
chance, thank you.

36:23.832 --> 36:24.765
Thank you so much.

36:24.767 --> 36:26.903
You can leave the check.

36:29.939 --> 36:33.408
You're not gonna
taste your dessert?

36:33.410 --> 36:35.843
Come on, you gotta
try it, right?

36:35.845 --> 36:36.943
I mean I don't know
about you guys,

36:36.945 --> 36:40.180
but it's a shame
to waste, right?

36:40.182 --> 36:41.017
No?

36:43.653 --> 36:44.852
It'll be a shame to
just not taste it,

36:44.854 --> 36:46.390
don't you think?

36:48.057 --> 36:49.923
Don't you think?

36:49.925 --> 36:51.959
Excuse me.

36:51.961 --> 36:53.964
Farrah please, Farrah.

36:55.164 --> 36:59.800
She's fine, just using
the bathroom probably.

36:59.802 --> 37:01.803
Farrah listen, Farrah
just wait, Farrah.

37:01.805 --> 37:03.171
Shut, shut up!

37:03.173 --> 37:04.838
What is your problem?

37:04.840 --> 37:05.673
You don't need to be like
that with me, all right?

37:05.675 --> 37:06.974
You've gotta be
kidding me Patrick,

37:06.976 --> 37:08.542
you are such a fucking joke!

37:08.544 --> 37:09.776
Do you think that man is gonna...

37:09.778 --> 37:10.977
You don't even
understand, okay?

37:10.979 --> 37:12.446
He sees potential in me!

37:12.448 --> 37:13.613
Look...

37:13.615 --> 37:14.215
Okay, a man's
gotta make sacrifices

37:14.217 --> 37:15.015
to get what he deserves.

37:15.017 --> 37:15.950
The only thing you...

37:15.952 --> 37:16.950
What's wrong with that?

37:16.952 --> 37:17.617
Is your wedding day!

37:22.992 --> 37:24.093
Get off me!

37:24.961 --> 37:26.827
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

37:26.829 --> 37:29.162
Baby it's fine, he just
wants to talk to you.

37:29.164 --> 37:30.933
Oh fuck, oh my God.

37:39.575 --> 37:41.876
You look ravishing.

37:41.878 --> 37:44.881
What the hell do
you want from me?

37:47.517 --> 37:49.617
Right to the chase, huh?

37:49.619 --> 37:52.787
Figured you'd like a little
foreplay first but, sure.

37:52.789 --> 37:55.025
Let's get down to business.

37:59.496 --> 38:02.064
You
need to let me go.

38:03.599 --> 38:05.265
Do you even know
why you're here?

38:05.267 --> 38:07.033
No I don't know.

38:07.035 --> 38:07.869
Farrah, right?

38:07.871 --> 38:09.206
Yeah.

38:11.907 --> 38:13.274
Let me tell you.

38:13.276 --> 38:14.478
Your date...

38:15.611 --> 38:17.079
He wanted something.

38:18.180 --> 38:19.015
Surprised?

38:20.182 --> 38:22.885
Well I saw you,
and I wanted you.

38:27.289 --> 38:28.958
So we struck a deal.

38:30.660 --> 38:32.029
I give him a job...

38:33.530 --> 38:36.533
Men respect him,
even die for him...

38:38.267 --> 38:40.001
And I get you.

38:40.003 --> 38:42.206
For one night, all to myself.

38:43.840 --> 38:45.008
For one night.

38:47.010 --> 38:48.943
Fucking liar.

38:48.945 --> 38:49.780
No.

39:08.831 --> 39:10.765
You're gonna regret that.

39:10.767 --> 39:12.033
I was gonna keep
you all to myself,

39:12.035 --> 39:14.301
but I think I'll let the
boys have a turn now.

39:14.303 --> 39:16.673
Jimmy come on, go get 'em.

39:24.012 --> 39:25.114
Here we come!

39:56.613 --> 39:57.711
We have
a material witness

39:57.713 --> 39:59.981
on an aggravated battery,

39:59.983 --> 40:02.850
with a handgun and they believe

40:02.852 --> 40:06.787
it might be a retaliation
to her testimony.

40:15.664 --> 40:16.963
So what happened again?

40:16.965 --> 40:19.166
She said she wanted a job.

40:19.168 --> 40:20.767
I'd bring her back to my place,

40:20.769 --> 40:23.137
next thing I know she's
making a pass at me.

40:23.139 --> 40:27.110
She starts crying about being
lonely and pressure and...

40:29.077 --> 40:30.343
She jumps.

40:30.345 --> 40:31.979
You lying son of a bitch!

40:31.981 --> 40:33.914
You fucking bastard, you
killed her, you killed her!

40:33.916 --> 40:36.149
Stay back,
we got it from here.

40:36.151 --> 40:39.021
Ask her fiance, he'll tell ya.

40:40.222 --> 40:43.059
What's he talking
about Patrick?

40:46.061 --> 40:48.995
Patrick, what is
he talking about?

40:48.997 --> 40:50.266
I don't know.

40:52.001 --> 40:55.702
What don't you know?

40:55.704 --> 40:58.107
What don't you know, Patrick?

41:00.175 --> 41:01.108
I'm sorry.

41:01.110 --> 41:02.776
You're sorry?

41:02.778 --> 41:05.412
What are you sorry about?

41:05.414 --> 41:09.149
What are you sorry
about, Patrick?

41:09.151 --> 41:13.153
Patrick, how did Farrah
get with Stanton Creed?

41:13.155 --> 41:14.354
I didn't mean for
any of this to happen.

41:14.356 --> 41:15.958
What to happen?

41:18.160 --> 41:20.794
Patrick, talk to me right now.

41:20.796 --> 41:22.896
My sister is dead.

41:22.898 --> 41:24.798
I need answers and
I need them now.

41:24.800 --> 41:26.166
How did she end up
with Stanton Creed?

41:27.970 --> 41:29.736
Talk to me you son of a bitch!

41:29.738 --> 41:31.838
How did Farrah get
with Stanton Creed?

41:31.840 --> 41:33.073
I'm sorry!

41:33.075 --> 41:34.475
Randy, Randy is a chemist.

41:34.477 --> 41:36.811
He's also the head
of operations.

41:36.813 --> 41:39.113
I believe Stanton has
one building where he

41:39.115 --> 41:41.247
produces and
distributes everything.

41:41.249 --> 41:42.916
And what's everything?

41:42.918 --> 41:45.385
Coke, weed, meth, you name it.

41:45.387 --> 41:48.055
It's all under one roof.

41:48.057 --> 41:51.158
We get our hands on
Randy, and we kill him.

41:51.160 --> 41:53.260
We take Stanton Creed,
and we kill him.

41:53.262 --> 41:55.262
Grey, we don't kill.

41:55.264 --> 41:57.164
We are not killers.

41:57.166 --> 41:58.399
We make sure
there's no one left,

41:58.401 --> 42:01.068
there'll be no one to
answer for any of this.

42:01.070 --> 42:02.336
We do this the right way,

42:02.338 --> 42:05.075
we bring them in,
they face a judge.

42:07.276 --> 42:08.142
Okay.

42:26.796 --> 42:28.162
Good chance you're trying
to get me killed, Grey.

42:28.164 --> 42:30.497
Just relax
and act normal.

42:30.499 --> 42:33.767
Don't show that you're afraid.

42:33.769 --> 42:36.102
They sense fear, they'll attack.

42:36.104 --> 42:37.805
What can I get
you guys to drink?

42:37.807 --> 42:39.810
Three tequilas.

42:41.410 --> 42:42.376
You sure this is
the right place?

42:42.378 --> 42:44.144
Yeah, it's the right place.

42:44.146 --> 42:46.312
This is where I met
Randy the first time.

42:46.314 --> 42:48.515
He has a room for
making the drugs,

42:48.517 --> 42:52.054
and he has a room for
selling the drugs.

42:54.856 --> 42:56.256
This fucking guy has got a room

42:56.258 --> 42:58.057
filled with mountains of cash.

42:58.059 --> 42:59.126
At least a half
of million dollars

42:59.128 --> 43:01.995
is counted and
tagged in this room.

43:01.997 --> 43:04.231
Every element of
Creed's operation

43:04.233 --> 43:06.267
is run out of this place.

43:06.269 --> 43:07.867
I'm telling you.

43:07.869 --> 43:08.505
Address.

43:10.405 --> 43:12.205
You bring that money
you pigs confiscated

43:12.207 --> 43:14.108
from that drug bust...

43:14.110 --> 43:16.242
I'll give you the address.

43:16.244 --> 43:18.312
How do I know I can trust you?

43:18.314 --> 43:20.414
You need the money, don't you?

43:20.416 --> 43:21.251
Yeah.

43:37.032 --> 43:39.265
Don't
skin on the tip, nigger.

43:39.267 --> 43:41.303
We need to talk to Randy.

43:42.604 --> 43:44.238
Now!

43:44.240 --> 43:47.541
I don't listen to
no nigger lovers.

43:49.244 --> 43:50.544
Funny guy, huh?

43:50.546 --> 43:51.915
Nigger lovers.

43:59.155 --> 44:00.254
Where the fuck is Randy?

44:00.256 --> 44:01.088
Fuck you.

44:01.090 --> 44:02.356
Fuck me?

44:02.358 --> 44:03.224
Listen, I'm gonna ask
you this one more time,

44:03.226 --> 44:04.892
and I'll do it in
more simple terms

44:04.894 --> 44:06.626
cause I know you hicks
have a little trouble

44:06.628 --> 44:09.296
understanding things sometimes.

44:09.298 --> 44:11.368
So where the fuck is Randy?

44:12.200 --> 44:13.202
Gentlemen.

44:14.236 --> 44:17.070
It seems you guys found me.

44:17.072 --> 44:18.472
We're not looking
for any trouble, Randy.

44:18.474 --> 44:22.575
We just want the
information you promised us.

44:22.577 --> 44:24.510
Oh, you don't
want any trouble...

44:24.512 --> 44:27.314
But you bring a
nigger into my home.

44:27.316 --> 44:28.948
You want something from me,

44:28.950 --> 44:31.151
but you have nothing
to offer me in return.

44:31.153 --> 44:33.254
I don't think you thought
this through, partner.

44:33.256 --> 44:34.222
You're looking
for a way out Randy,

44:34.224 --> 44:36.457
I'm still the guy that
can get that for you.

44:36.459 --> 44:40.463
I just need an address,
or a name, or something.

44:42.298 --> 44:45.131
I wanted you
dead, but good help

44:45.133 --> 44:48.035
is just so hard to come by.

44:48.037 --> 44:49.303
Now look at my luck,

44:49.305 --> 44:52.039
you two morons come right to me.

44:55.144 --> 44:56.410
Kill him.

44:56.412 --> 44:58.211
Have fun being Stanton
Creed's personal bitch.

44:58.213 --> 44:59.914
I'm no man's bitch.

44:59.916 --> 45:03.149
I do everything on my
terms and my terms alone.

45:03.151 --> 45:04.984
Stanton Creed needs me,

45:04.986 --> 45:07.057
not the other way around.

45:44.193 --> 45:45.428
Grey, let's go!

45:53.501 --> 45:55.438
Not without my gun.

45:59.275 --> 46:01.108
We can't let anyone else
get involved in this,

46:01.110 --> 46:02.309
especially not a whore.

46:02.311 --> 46:03.309
I'm not a whore,
I'm an escort.

46:03.311 --> 46:04.244
You're a whore.

46:04.246 --> 46:05.445
I've been following you.

46:05.447 --> 46:08.314
I've been following
you for a while.

46:10.753 --> 46:13.354
We don't have
time for this shit.

46:13.356 --> 46:15.691
Why were you following me?

46:16.691 --> 46:19.093
Why were you following me?

46:19.095 --> 46:22.129
The girl in the
backseat wanted revenge.

46:22.131 --> 46:23.366
I could relate.

46:25.334 --> 46:27.133
She went on to tell us
about how her sister

46:27.135 --> 46:29.438
was with the Mayor frequently.

46:30.606 --> 46:32.271
She said she got a
call from her sister

46:32.273 --> 46:34.274
the night we got
ambushed in the Burg,

46:34.276 --> 46:36.709
saying how this was her
last time with the Mayor,

46:36.711 --> 46:38.414
with the business,

46:39.414 --> 46:43.419
saying she hated the guy
but he paid top dollar.

46:47.389 --> 46:50.559
I guess he's violent
with his escorts.

46:52.528 --> 46:57.296
But it looks like it was just
her last night all together.

46:57.298 --> 47:00.466
I found her hours
later in that corridor.

47:00.468 --> 47:03.403
Our fates
are predetermined.

47:03.405 --> 47:04.238
I heard about your sister,

47:04.240 --> 47:06.372
and I knew that you
would understand.

47:06.374 --> 47:08.642
You don't anything
about my sister.

47:08.644 --> 47:10.244
Okay listen, I'm sorry
about your sister,

47:10.246 --> 47:11.077
but I'm not the type of guy...

47:11.079 --> 47:12.546
Don't, just don't.

47:12.548 --> 47:14.150
You will help me.

47:15.284 --> 47:16.383
We'll help you.

47:16.385 --> 47:18.184
What?

47:18.186 --> 47:20.086
We will help her.

47:20.088 --> 47:21.622
Because I believe in revenge,

47:21.624 --> 47:23.657
and I believe in evil.

47:23.659 --> 47:25.494
And I see evil in you.

47:27.063 --> 47:29.562
Listen, I didn't tell
them anything, okay?

47:29.564 --> 47:31.398
They came in, they
cleaned house,

47:31.400 --> 47:33.300
but I didn't tell them anything.

47:33.302 --> 47:36.803
You just ran and hid
like a little coward bitch.

47:36.805 --> 47:37.838
So you're telling
me it was just some

47:37.840 --> 47:39.439
tall white dude with long hair,

47:39.441 --> 47:41.642
and a younger black guy,
and that's all you got?

47:41.644 --> 47:43.412
That's all I got.

47:44.313 --> 47:46.146
That's really all we need.

47:46.148 --> 47:47.784
Should I call it in?

47:48.784 --> 47:51.251
Nah, call the boss.

47:51.253 --> 47:53.187
This is getting outta control.

47:53.189 --> 47:55.421
This is not what
we signed up for.

47:55.423 --> 47:58.459
No, this is exactly
what we signed up for.

47:58.461 --> 48:02.232
We are here on this
earth for one reason.

48:05.300 --> 48:06.135
Rule...

48:07.135 --> 48:08.404
Conquer, greed.

48:11.474 --> 48:13.075
We've got the cops.

48:14.209 --> 48:16.376
We've got the
business leaders...

48:17.813 --> 48:19.546
We've even got the Mayor.

48:19.548 --> 48:20.582
Dick.

48:22.318 --> 48:25.352
Boston fellas, well
Boston is the center.

48:25.354 --> 48:28.521
It is the center of our empire.

48:28.523 --> 48:32.191
And what you see
before you now...

48:32.193 --> 48:34.197
Well, that is the weapon

48:36.599 --> 48:38.832
that will give us the strength

48:38.834 --> 48:41.267
to make the East our
stomping grounds.

48:41.269 --> 48:44.440
Enough with the
cheap talk, Stanton.

48:45.340 --> 48:47.841
Get to the fucking point.

48:47.843 --> 48:49.175
Don't interrupt me.

48:49.177 --> 48:50.443
I'm not sure why any of you

48:50.445 --> 48:51.245
would jump at the
chance to team up

48:51.247 --> 48:53.446
with this petty crook.

48:53.448 --> 48:54.881
We were doing just fine
before you showed up

48:54.883 --> 48:56.316
shooting up everything.

48:56.318 --> 48:58.519
You know, he's
got a point Creed.

48:58.521 --> 49:02.321
Why the fuck would we want
to partner up with you, huh?

49:02.323 --> 49:03.559
I understand.

49:04.526 --> 49:05.360
Kill him.

49:17.673 --> 49:19.305
Let's try it again.

49:19.307 --> 49:21.341
Maybe less interruptions.

49:21.343 --> 49:22.542
This is Eve.

49:22.544 --> 49:24.611
She's been with Creed
since the beginning.

49:24.613 --> 49:27.280
Her family took him in
after his parents died.

49:27.282 --> 49:28.548
She's been with him
since high school,

49:28.550 --> 49:29.483
and the rest is history.

49:29.485 --> 49:31.285
How long you've been
following her, Grey?

49:31.287 --> 49:32.586
Five months.

49:32.588 --> 49:34.220
She's surrounded by armed guards

49:34.222 --> 49:36.390
and she carries a
pistol in her purse.

49:36.392 --> 49:38.758
You're telling me this
woman has all the intel?

49:38.760 --> 49:41.562
She's the closest
thing he has to family.

49:41.564 --> 49:45.666
First you take the woman,
then you get the intel,

49:45.668 --> 49:48.204
and then you send a message.

49:59.682 --> 50:01.715
Just try not to
think about her.

50:01.717 --> 50:03.749
Eventually all the pain
and the hate will go away.

50:03.751 --> 50:06.452
I don't want the pain
and the hate to go away.

50:06.454 --> 50:07.720
I need it to consume me so

50:07.722 --> 50:08.655
I'd have enough hate
in me to kill a man

50:08.657 --> 50:09.722
and not feel any remorse for it.

50:09.724 --> 50:10.957
That's not the person you are.

50:10.959 --> 50:13.329
Maybe it is, Francheska.

50:15.597 --> 50:16.696
Trenton.

50:16.698 --> 50:17.698
What's up, Grey?

50:17.700 --> 50:18.532
We've got trouble.

50:18.534 --> 50:19.932
Trenton, what the
hell's going on?

50:19.934 --> 50:20.769
What?

50:21.936 --> 50:22.602
Look this is over,
we've gotta go.

50:22.604 --> 50:23.736
Let go of me.

50:23.738 --> 50:24.671
Francheska...

50:24.673 --> 50:25.805
This is not over for me.

50:25.807 --> 50:28.374
We have her right in front
of us, why are we running?

50:28.376 --> 50:30.309
You see those
two men over there?

50:30.311 --> 50:31.678
Hm?

50:31.680 --> 50:33.012
Those are two of
Stanton Creed's elite.

50:33.014 --> 50:34.314
I don't care.

50:34.316 --> 50:34.948
So we do nothing?

50:34.950 --> 50:36.416
We do nothing.

50:36.418 --> 50:37.617
I did nothing last
time and my sister

50:37.619 --> 50:39.686
lost her life because of it.

50:39.688 --> 50:40.754
We have a deal.

50:40.756 --> 50:43.756
I help you, and you help me.

50:43.758 --> 50:44.860
Francheska.

50:47.528 --> 50:48.528
Fuck!

50:48.530 --> 50:49.762
Hello.

50:49.764 --> 50:50.597
Hello, how are you?

50:50.599 --> 50:51.867
Good, thank you.

50:52.834 --> 50:54.501
I will do...

50:54.503 --> 50:58.372
Oh, I will do the
"Supreme Queen" package.

50:58.374 --> 50:59.439
Has a nice ring to it.

50:59.441 --> 51:01.742
Yeah, you would click
the most expensive package.

51:01.744 --> 51:03.577
You gonna pay, love?

51:03.579 --> 51:06.646
It's 88 dollars, you're
not serious, are you?

51:06.648 --> 51:07.580
Are you?

51:07.582 --> 51:08.649
Just pay up.

51:08.651 --> 51:09.983
Come on, don't be so cheap.

51:09.985 --> 51:12.354
Yeah, don't be so cheap.

51:17.559 --> 51:21.231
I'm gonna have a seat
in the waiting room.

51:24.300 --> 51:24.930
Hey.

51:24.932 --> 51:26.468
How you doing?

51:27.503 --> 51:28.871
You come with me.

51:32.340 --> 51:33.976
Come on, come with me.

51:38.414 --> 51:39.546
Don't move!

51:39.548 --> 51:40.950
What are you doing?

51:41.849 --> 51:43.082
What do we do when we find her?

51:43.084 --> 51:44.550
I don't know Trenton,
are you kidding me?

51:44.552 --> 51:45.051
What the hell do you
mean you don't know?

51:45.053 --> 51:46.289
I don't know!

51:48.423 --> 51:49.726
That feels nice.

51:51.727 --> 51:52.658
So last week was my birthday,

51:52.660 --> 51:53.926
and Stanton bought me this pad...

51:53.928 --> 51:55.662
Hands up, hands up,
back up to the wall.

51:55.664 --> 51:56.930
Shut up
and get on the ground.

51:56.932 --> 51:58.597
You
shut the fuck up.

51:58.599 --> 51:59.399
Do you two idiots know
who the fuck my husband is?

51:59.401 --> 52:00.334
Shut up!

52:00.336 --> 52:00.966
Shut up!

52:00.968 --> 52:01.801
Bitch!

52:01.803 --> 52:03.537
Shut up!

52:03.539 --> 52:04.671
I will have your head in
a trophy case after this.

52:04.673 --> 52:06.106
Get the fuck off me!

52:06.108 --> 52:07.841
The fuck off me!

52:07.843 --> 52:09.742
All right that was
easy, now what do we do?

52:09.744 --> 52:11.644
You,
where's the back door?

52:11.646 --> 52:12.678
Where is the back door!

52:12.680 --> 52:13.814
Don't tell her shit!

52:13.816 --> 52:15.015
Where is it?

52:15.017 --> 52:17.850
I'll show you, it's
right over there.

52:17.852 --> 52:20.354
Let's go.

52:20.356 --> 52:20.986
Come on, bring her out.

52:20.988 --> 52:21.821
Get the fuck off me!

52:21.823 --> 52:23.557
Shut up!

52:23.559 --> 52:24.457
You shut up, I bet you're
a real professional out here

52:24.459 --> 52:25.624
in the broad daylight.

52:25.626 --> 52:26.859
Aw, shut up!

52:26.861 --> 52:27.693
Get in
the fucking car.

52:27.695 --> 52:28.729
Get in
the car, let's go.

52:28.731 --> 52:29.963
Let's go!

52:29.965 --> 52:32.869
Wait 'til Stanton
hears about this.

52:34.635 --> 52:36.005
Where is my wife?

52:38.740 --> 52:40.573
We don't know.

52:40.575 --> 52:41.408
We've
been looking all day,

52:41.410 --> 52:43.046
and the trail is cold.

52:46.115 --> 52:47.580
Are you crazy?

52:47.582 --> 52:49.885
You just struck
a police officer!

52:51.820 --> 52:53.323
I write the law!

52:55.124 --> 52:56.392
Yeah, fine.

52:57.126 --> 52:58.828
I do what I want.

52:59.695 --> 53:00.894
Fine.

53:00.896 --> 53:02.028
Wait.

53:02.030 --> 53:03.530
We have a lead.

53:03.532 --> 53:04.164
Oh, you have a lead?

53:04.166 --> 53:05.564
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

53:05.566 --> 53:07.501
The two guys who stuck
up Randy's joint.

53:07.503 --> 53:09.669
We think they're involved with
the kidnapping, all right?

53:09.671 --> 53:11.838
These
cops, who turned vigilantes.

53:11.840 --> 53:13.073
Who, who?

53:13.075 --> 53:15.876
Trenton Higgins, and
Officer Grey Gideon.

53:15.878 --> 53:19.749
Trenton's sister committed
suicide at your place.

53:20.916 --> 53:22.352
Mayor Gideon.

53:24.820 --> 53:26.686
Where are these
guys right now?

53:26.688 --> 53:27.921
We don't know, they're MIA,

53:27.923 --> 53:28.789
they haven't been
to their apartments

53:28.791 --> 53:30.559
or to work for weeks.

53:31.427 --> 53:32.762
What do we do?

53:37.832 --> 53:38.867
We wait.

53:45.039 --> 53:47.974
Tell me what I need to know.

53:47.976 --> 53:49.979
I don't know, I swear.

53:58.486 --> 54:00.088
I don't know anything.

54:06.695 --> 54:07.626
Please...

54:07.628 --> 54:08.160
Just tell me where he is.

54:08.162 --> 54:08.995
I don't know.

54:08.997 --> 54:09.930
Tell me where he...

54:09.932 --> 54:10.863
I wouldn't, I wouldn't...

54:10.865 --> 54:11.965
Tell me where Creed is!

54:11.967 --> 54:14.403
You fucking motherfucker!

54:16.972 --> 54:18.905
The mornings
remind me of her.

54:18.907 --> 54:21.841
It's like I can't escape it.

54:21.843 --> 54:24.811
I would've loved
to have met her.

54:24.813 --> 54:27.079
Besides my sister,
I can honestly say

54:27.081 --> 54:30.986
there was no one else
who ever really loved me.

54:32.119 --> 54:34.153
That's not
necessarily a bad thing.

54:34.155 --> 54:35.588
It means less people
to worry about, right?

54:35.590 --> 54:38.658
You can't protect
everyone, Trenton.

54:38.660 --> 54:39.758
When that moment comes,

54:39.760 --> 54:42.963
when that Mayor's standing
right in front of you...

54:42.965 --> 54:43.763
Will you be able to do it?

54:43.765 --> 54:45.798
I've made it
this far on a dream

54:45.800 --> 54:47.867
that I would one day
get my hands on him.

54:47.869 --> 54:49.669
You better believe
I will kill him

54:49.671 --> 54:50.870
the first chance I get.

54:50.872 --> 54:52.638
It will mean
more if you don't.

54:52.640 --> 54:53.876
That's my call!

54:55.977 --> 54:57.010
Why did you
think I could help?

54:57.012 --> 55:01.180
I didn't know anything,
I went with my gut.

55:01.182 --> 55:02.615
There's a kindness in your eyes

55:02.617 --> 55:04.453
that I saw that night.

55:07.122 --> 55:10.055
And I knew you were my guy.

55:10.057 --> 55:12.758
I like the sound of that.

55:12.760 --> 55:13.959
What?

55:13.961 --> 55:17.229
I don't
know, me being your guy.

55:17.231 --> 55:18.500
Is that so?

55:20.735 --> 55:21.934
Are you hitting on me, loverboy?

55:24.238 --> 55:27.073
Francheska if I
was hitting on you...

55:27.075 --> 55:28.244
You'd know it.

56:03.744 --> 56:07.613
Jesus Christ Grey, what
the hell is going on?

56:07.615 --> 56:08.247
Grey!

56:08.249 --> 56:10.018
Oh, it's in my gun.

56:12.053 --> 56:13.954
Some of us were
trying to get answers

56:13.956 --> 56:15.622
while the others were
trying to get laid.

56:15.624 --> 56:16.856
Get a grip on yourself, Grey.

56:16.858 --> 56:18.291
We don't do this,
this isn't our M.O.

56:18.293 --> 56:19.158
We're the good guys.

56:19.160 --> 56:20.926
Good guys lose.

56:26.901 --> 56:28.602
The bitch speaks.

56:28.604 --> 56:29.336
What'd she say?

56:29.338 --> 56:30.269
She gave me an address.

56:30.271 --> 56:31.671
Good, what was it?

56:31.673 --> 56:32.271
I
could take you there

56:32.273 --> 56:33.205
and it'd be easy,

56:33.207 --> 56:34.073
but I'm not gonna do that.

56:34.075 --> 56:35.008
Francheska...

56:35.010 --> 56:36.108
Don't you fuck with me.

56:36.110 --> 56:38.010
What are you
gonna do Grey, drown me?

56:38.012 --> 56:40.280
I don't care what you do,
I'm not telling you shit.

56:40.282 --> 56:41.981
Put the fucking gun down.

56:41.983 --> 56:43.850
You want me to tell you?

56:43.852 --> 56:45.619
You get me in the
same room as the Mayor

56:45.621 --> 56:47.122
like you promised.

56:48.289 --> 56:50.923
We do need him
outta the picture.

56:50.925 --> 56:51.957
They all need to die.

56:51.959 --> 56:54.093
So we have a deal?

56:54.095 --> 56:55.662
Yeah.

56:55.664 --> 56:56.599
Not dead.

56:58.066 --> 57:00.166
It'll mean more if we bring
the Mayor in, not kill him.

57:00.168 --> 57:03.068
We put him behind bars.

57:03.070 --> 57:03.905
Sure.

57:11.113 --> 57:12.181
We're fucked.

57:14.015 --> 57:15.050
Shit.

57:16.218 --> 57:17.283
What is this?

57:17.285 --> 57:18.117
I'm sorry.

57:18.119 --> 57:19.588
You're sorry?

57:44.211 --> 57:45.046
Really?

57:48.150 --> 57:51.283
You left her in
the fucking street?

57:51.285 --> 57:53.053
Left her in the fucking street?

57:53.055 --> 57:55.088
All right,
all right, all right.

57:55.090 --> 57:56.923
Take her home.

57:56.925 --> 57:57.923
Take her home.

57:57.925 --> 57:58.725
Take her...

57:58.727 --> 57:59.325
We'll...

57:59.327 --> 58:01.394
Take her home.

58:01.396 --> 58:02.829
It's gonna be more...

58:02.831 --> 58:04.129
Well we needed a
true Conservative,

58:04.131 --> 58:05.330
that was the problem.

58:05.332 --> 58:07.399
It wasn't our ideas,
it was you know,

58:07.401 --> 58:09.102
it was that we had this guy

58:09.104 --> 58:10.202
and we tried to make him
into a real conservative,

58:10.204 --> 58:11.236
you think that's a mistake?

58:11.238 --> 58:12.439
That's not where the country is,

58:12.441 --> 58:14.106
that's what Richard was
talking about before

58:14.108 --> 58:16.175
in terms of that's not
how you expand the map,

58:16.177 --> 58:19.845
by going more you know,
cuckoo crazy to the right.

58:19.847 --> 58:20.981
That's not gonna get you there.

58:20.983 --> 58:24.017
And
equality and social issues like

58:24.019 --> 58:26.318
marriage equality and
reproductive rights,

58:26.320 --> 58:27.986
the Republicans...

58:27.988 --> 58:29.388
We
ran, obviously it worked.

58:29.390 --> 58:30.789
Mayoral campaigns

58:30.791 --> 58:32.959
as well as city council
offices as well.

58:32.961 --> 58:35.428
Fucking pieces of shit!

58:35.430 --> 58:36.829
That's bullshit.

58:36.831 --> 58:37.997
For me, as a Republican

58:37.999 --> 58:39.198
looking at the
Republican Party...

58:39.200 --> 58:42.167
It was a horrifying
primary process,

58:42.169 --> 58:44.504
the damage the republicans...

58:44.506 --> 58:46.205
Come on!

58:46.207 --> 58:48.108
More than
any negative advertising...

58:49.778 --> 58:51.211
Hey,
we're gonna get right at it.

58:51.213 --> 58:52.111
There's a lot of good
things going on over here...

58:53.481 --> 58:55.215
You're late!

58:55.217 --> 58:56.283
So we're
gonna hit it hard tomorrow.

58:56.285 --> 58:58.084
What do
you think was the key thing

58:58.086 --> 59:01.220
of being re-elected
for your first time?

59:01.222 --> 59:03.726
Well, I...

59:05.059 --> 59:08.995
You're late, and
you're not who I ordered.

59:08.997 --> 59:10.796
Where's the blonde?

59:10.798 --> 59:12.231
They sent me.

59:12.233 --> 59:15.203
I can leave if
you don't want me.

59:21.209 --> 59:22.111
Jacket off.

59:23.512 --> 59:24.345
Off.

59:26.247 --> 59:27.082
Come in.

59:28.082 --> 59:29.084
Turn around.

59:35.122 --> 59:37.390
Mayor, I am your biggest fan.

59:37.392 --> 59:38.858
Oh, are you?

59:38.860 --> 59:41.193
You have no idea how
long I've been waiting

59:41.195 --> 59:43.095
to get the chance to meet you.

59:43.097 --> 59:44.233
How do you do?

59:45.233 --> 59:46.836
Nice to meet you.

59:54.276 --> 59:55.207
How do you like it?

59:55.209 --> 59:57.109
How don't I like it?

59:57.111 --> 59:59.412
I think tonight, let's go...

59:59.414 --> 01:00:02.448
Let's go a little rough, eh?

01:00:02.450 --> 01:00:04.283
You like it rough?

01:00:04.285 --> 01:00:05.584
Well I like it kinky.

01:00:05.586 --> 01:00:07.253
Oh, you do?

01:00:07.255 --> 01:00:10.189
Oh, you kinky little
bitch you huh?

01:00:10.191 --> 01:00:12.325
I'm gonna tie you up.

01:00:12.327 --> 01:00:15.093
Oh, you're gonna tie me up?

01:00:15.095 --> 01:00:15.930
All right.

01:00:17.164 --> 01:00:20.166
Tie me up, I think
I'll like that.

01:00:20.168 --> 01:00:21.466
I'm down.

01:00:21.468 --> 01:00:23.937
This is gonna be fun.

01:00:23.939 --> 01:00:26.876
Oh, but now I can't
see you baby...

01:00:28.410 --> 01:00:31.280
I can't see your beautiful body.

01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:33.613
You mean business.

01:00:33.615 --> 01:00:36.452
All right Ms.
Kinky, what you got?

01:00:44.392 --> 01:00:47.126
Come on, come on where'd you go?

01:00:47.128 --> 01:00:50.198
Let's go, I'm ready
to have some fun.

01:00:51.265 --> 01:00:52.599
But I'm along for
the ride, let's go,

01:00:52.601 --> 01:00:54.166
where did you go?

01:00:54.168 --> 01:00:57.405
Come on, I'm ready
for some fun, where...

01:00:58.506 --> 01:00:59.341
What's up?

01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:07.048
What are you doing?

01:01:10.318 --> 01:01:12.220
Do you know who I am?

01:01:13.421 --> 01:01:14.256
No?

01:01:15.590 --> 01:01:17.358
You knew my sister.

01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:19.524
You knew my sister very well.

01:01:19.526 --> 01:01:21.593
I don't know anybody.

01:01:21.595 --> 01:01:23.262
I don't know anybody.

01:01:23.264 --> 01:01:25.398
Get the knife away from me!

01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:28.871
She was young, and
she was beautiful,

01:01:29.570 --> 01:01:32.104
and she was everything to me.

01:01:32.106 --> 01:01:34.407
Uncuff me.

01:01:34.409 --> 01:01:35.975
Catherine.

01:01:35.977 --> 01:01:39.412
Her name was Catherine,
you piece of shit!

01:01:39.414 --> 01:01:41.180
I have money, you want money?

01:01:41.182 --> 01:01:42.148
I don't
want your fucking money!

01:01:42.150 --> 01:01:45.050
I have a safe in the
closet, how much money?

01:01:45.052 --> 01:01:46.986
I'll set you up for my...

01:01:46.988 --> 01:01:48.086
Shut up!

01:01:48.088 --> 01:01:49.289
You want money?

01:01:49.291 --> 01:01:50.590
I don't want
your fucking money.

01:01:50.592 --> 01:01:51.624
I got a
boatload of money,

01:01:51.626 --> 01:01:52.658
there's a safe in the closet.

01:01:52.660 --> 01:01:54.994
Shut up, don't lie to me.

01:01:54.996 --> 01:01:57.129
Don't you dare lie to me!

01:01:57.131 --> 01:01:59.432
Look at me, look at me,
look at me, all right?

01:01:59.434 --> 01:02:04.070
You're a good lady, you don't
need to do this, all right?

01:02:04.072 --> 01:02:06.405
About Catherine, I'm sorry
what happened to Catherine,

01:02:06.407 --> 01:02:07.472
I loved her.

01:02:07.474 --> 01:02:09.374
Shut up!

01:02:09.376 --> 01:02:11.077
I have a
problem, all right?

01:02:11.079 --> 01:02:11.711
Shut up!

01:02:11.713 --> 01:02:12.644
I need help!

01:02:12.646 --> 01:02:13.646
Shut up!

01:02:13.648 --> 01:02:15.347
Don't, don't...

01:02:15.349 --> 01:02:17.550
Just get me help, okay?

01:02:20.421 --> 01:02:22.254
I need help!

01:02:22.256 --> 01:02:23.323
Stop it!

01:02:23.325 --> 01:02:24.157
Shut up!

01:02:24.159 --> 01:02:25.224
No, stop!

01:02:25.226 --> 01:02:27.126
Get away from me!

01:02:27.128 --> 01:02:29.131
You crazy fucking whore!

01:02:31.131 --> 01:02:33.968
This isn't just
for my sister...

01:02:37.439 --> 01:02:38.537
Don't...

01:02:38.539 --> 01:02:39.604
This is for Boston.

01:02:39.606 --> 01:02:41.610
Don't do it...

01:03:55.550 --> 01:03:56.485
Hey baby.

01:03:57.818 --> 01:03:59.785
You wanna help a girl out?

01:03:59.787 --> 01:04:01.254
Yeah, baby.

01:04:01.256 --> 01:04:02.321
You're sure far from the city,

01:04:02.323 --> 01:04:04.222
you'll get yourself in
trouble looking that good.

01:04:04.224 --> 01:04:06.091
I can handle myself.

01:04:06.093 --> 01:04:07.325
Are you gonna help me out

01:04:07.327 --> 01:04:08.394
or am I gonna have to
walk home all alone?

01:04:08.396 --> 01:04:09.562
We gotta help her now, Grey.

01:04:09.564 --> 01:04:11.000
No, we don't.

01:04:12.767 --> 01:04:15.300
This isn't a
fucking game, Grey.

01:04:15.302 --> 01:04:18.573
This is Francheska
we're talking about.

01:04:30.251 --> 01:04:31.086
Not bad.

01:04:32.253 --> 01:04:35.090
Now we need to get
rid of the body.

01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:41.260
No, that can't be...

01:04:41.262 --> 01:04:42.562
What are you doing?

01:04:42.564 --> 01:04:43.428
Use your damn head.

01:04:43.430 --> 01:04:44.396
Use my head?

01:04:44.398 --> 01:04:45.798
He was there the night
my sister was murdered,

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:47.200
I know he had something
to do with it Grey,

01:04:47.202 --> 01:04:47.834
I fucking know it!

01:04:47.836 --> 01:04:48.667
Calm down.

01:04:48.669 --> 01:04:49.501
Calm down?

01:04:49.503 --> 01:04:50.535
If there's a chance,

01:04:50.537 --> 01:04:51.437
you can take it.

01:04:51.439 --> 01:04:53.539
But don't go risking
our lives over it.

01:04:53.541 --> 01:04:54.774
Wait for the right moment.

01:04:54.776 --> 01:04:55.774
Well when's the
right moment, Grey?

01:04:55.776 --> 01:04:57.410
You'll know.

01:04:57.412 --> 01:04:59.281
It's when they slip up.

01:05:03.550 --> 01:05:04.619
Looks good.

01:05:06.287 --> 01:05:08.153
Dude, you're gonna
blow us all up man.

01:05:08.155 --> 01:05:10.058
All right, all right.

01:05:13.227 --> 01:05:14.827
That's it, mix it up.

01:05:14.829 --> 01:05:16.365
Rock and roll.

01:05:24.706 --> 01:05:26.606
Make sure these
counts are accurate,

01:05:26.608 --> 01:05:27.573
I don't wanna get through
that sad bullshit...

01:05:27.575 --> 01:05:28.610
I know.

01:05:29.677 --> 01:05:32.577
I already told you the
last time wasn't my fault.

01:05:32.579 --> 01:05:36.084
I don't wanna hear
it, just get it done.

01:05:46.293 --> 01:05:49.464
You can go ahead and
take a break now.

01:05:52.599 --> 01:05:55.570
It means get the
fuck outta here!

01:06:06.581 --> 01:06:07.847
Man, fuck this shit.

01:06:07.849 --> 01:06:09.215
I'm not letting him get
away from me this time.

01:06:09.217 --> 01:06:10.716
Use your damn head.

01:06:10.718 --> 01:06:13.452
We have to kill Randy.

01:06:13.454 --> 01:06:14.320
Let it go.

01:06:14.322 --> 01:06:15.655
What do
you mean let it go?

01:06:15.657 --> 01:06:16.658
Let it go!

01:06:18.293 --> 01:06:19.624
Grey, you're
talking to a brother

01:06:19.626 --> 01:06:20.559
of a murdered sister,

01:06:20.561 --> 01:06:22.928
you're gonna tell me let it go?

01:06:22.930 --> 01:06:25.367
Farrah was your family too.

01:06:31.539 --> 01:06:33.506
They're here.

01:06:33.508 --> 01:06:34.606
Where?

01:06:34.608 --> 01:06:35.443
Inside.

01:06:36.744 --> 01:06:38.477
Good.

01:06:38.479 --> 01:06:39.579
Right where we want 'em.

01:06:39.581 --> 01:06:41.914
You find them, you kill them...

01:06:41.916 --> 01:06:44.483
And spread the rest out.

01:06:44.485 --> 01:06:45.320
Done.

01:06:50.724 --> 01:06:51.756
What you
got there, Randy?

01:06:51.758 --> 01:06:53.693
Motherfucker.

01:06:53.695 --> 01:06:54.526
Say goodbye.

01:06:54.528 --> 01:06:55.461
Wait, wait, wait.

01:06:55.463 --> 01:06:57.597
Think Grey, just think
for a minute here.

01:06:57.599 --> 01:06:58.497
Come on, buddy.

01:06:58.499 --> 01:07:00.666
Look at all this cash
just sittin' here.

01:07:00.668 --> 01:07:02.001
Come on buddy, give me help.

01:07:02.003 --> 01:07:03.669
You wanna help me, Randy?

01:07:03.671 --> 01:07:05.570
No, I wanna help both of us.

01:07:05.572 --> 01:07:07.506
Make sure we all get
outta here unnoticed

01:07:07.508 --> 01:07:08.841
with all Creed's dirty money.

01:07:08.843 --> 01:07:11.343
Hey, you
would betray Stanton.

01:07:11.345 --> 01:07:13.312
Let's make a deal,
what do you say?

01:07:13.314 --> 01:07:14.713
There's no one out there.

01:07:14.715 --> 01:07:16.582
We cleared out the
entire first floor.

01:07:16.584 --> 01:07:17.582
It's a trap.

01:07:17.584 --> 01:07:18.984
How stupid are you?

01:07:18.986 --> 01:07:20.753
Creed wanted you to
come here and find him,

01:07:20.755 --> 01:07:21.820
he's ready for you.

01:07:21.822 --> 01:07:23.488
Shut up.

01:07:23.490 --> 01:07:25.024
I don't believe a
word you're saying.

01:07:25.026 --> 01:07:27.325
And I don't have
any reason to lie.

01:07:27.327 --> 01:07:29.894
Just hear me about
before it's too late.

01:07:29.896 --> 01:07:31.030
You're not gonna
get outta here alive

01:07:31.032 --> 01:07:32.265
without my help.

01:07:32.267 --> 01:07:34.736
Then you better start talking.

01:07:35.769 --> 01:07:37.672
God damn that's good.

01:07:38.805 --> 01:07:40.705
Fucking Randy.

01:07:40.707 --> 01:07:41.740
"Aw, make sure the money,

01:07:41.742 --> 01:07:42.941
make sure the counts are right!"

01:07:42.943 --> 01:07:44.410
Fucking asshole.

01:07:44.412 --> 01:07:46.412
I know what I'm doing,
I know what I'm doing.

01:07:46.414 --> 01:07:47.713
All right, I'm the
fucking man now,

01:07:47.715 --> 01:07:48.648
I'm running the show now.

01:07:48.650 --> 01:07:51.450
Now it's me, and Stanton...

01:07:51.452 --> 01:07:54.287
I'm fucking, I'm Stanton's
left hand man right now.

01:07:54.289 --> 01:07:56.592
I fuckin' know what I'm doing.

01:08:06.434 --> 01:08:07.666
Where the fuck did they

01:08:07.668 --> 01:08:09.068
get their hands on
her God damn it?

01:08:09.070 --> 01:08:10.736
It was you!

01:08:10.738 --> 01:08:14.606
She was my fucking world,
she was my everything!

01:08:14.608 --> 01:08:16.309
You son of a bitch.

01:08:16.310 --> 01:08:17.609
Wait, wait, wait.

01:08:17.612 --> 01:08:19.481
Shut up!

01:08:25.853 --> 01:08:27.520
Why!

01:08:27.522 --> 01:08:29.453
Stanton just said he
wanted her for one night.

01:08:29.456 --> 01:08:32.760
He wasn't supposed to
kill her, I'm sorry!

01:08:34.328 --> 01:08:34.962
What?

01:08:37.631 --> 01:08:38.634
I'm sorry!

01:09:01.356 --> 01:09:03.055
This room and
others just like it

01:09:03.057 --> 01:09:07.091
is filled with enough
cash to start a new life.

01:09:07.094 --> 01:09:08.493
This is wrong.

01:09:08.495 --> 01:09:09.694
Creed and the Mayor
have been working

01:09:09.696 --> 01:09:11.696
this angle for years.

01:09:11.698 --> 01:09:12.733
Exactly.

01:09:13.835 --> 01:09:17.535
Take it all with you, and
let me walk out of here.

01:09:17.537 --> 01:09:19.002
That's all I'm asking you.

01:09:19.005 --> 01:09:20.773
I can show you how to get
out without being seen.

01:09:20.774 --> 01:09:21.707
I really wish I
could trust you.

01:09:21.709 --> 01:09:22.975
He needs help.

01:09:22.977 --> 01:09:24.542
It's the only thing
he won't see coming.

01:09:24.545 --> 01:09:25.877
What the hell are
you talking about?

01:09:25.879 --> 01:09:28.479
He just said he's
waiting for you two.

01:09:28.482 --> 01:09:30.649
He's not gonna be
prepared for a small army.

01:09:30.651 --> 01:09:32.584
Where do you suppose
we find a small army?

01:09:32.586 --> 01:09:33.886
We call the police!

01:09:33.888 --> 01:09:34.953
Stanton owns the police.

01:09:34.955 --> 01:09:36.087
He doesn't own me.

01:09:36.089 --> 01:09:37.523
And if I'm not under his pay,

01:09:37.524 --> 01:09:39.557
maybe there are others
who aren't as well.

01:09:39.559 --> 01:09:41.761
Spare my life and I'll
get you out of here,

01:09:41.763 --> 01:09:44.629
we don't have to be
wishing on some miracle.

01:09:46.433 --> 01:09:47.966
What the hell
is wrong with you?

01:09:47.969 --> 01:09:49.702
You didn't have to kill him!

01:09:49.703 --> 01:09:52.037
He would've betrayed us
the first opportunity he got.

01:09:52.038 --> 01:09:55.474
We're not killers, you're
supposed to be the law.

01:09:55.476 --> 01:09:56.909
Let's call it in.

01:10:05.753 --> 01:10:07.419
Who can hear that?

01:10:07.421 --> 01:10:09.821
It's a secure channel
that only District C-11

01:10:09.823 --> 01:10:10.791
has access to.

01:10:12.994 --> 01:10:15.160
We're trained to keep these
radios on us at all times

01:10:15.162 --> 01:10:18.767
in case an emergency
message is sent out.

01:10:20.535 --> 01:10:22.371
What does that mean?

01:10:23.504 --> 01:10:25.503
You arrogant fuck.

01:10:25.505 --> 01:10:28.774
It means that every officer
in the night division

01:10:28.776 --> 01:10:32.177
that is and is not
on your payroll

01:10:32.179 --> 01:10:34.482
just heard the challenge.

01:10:35.215 --> 01:10:36.050
Good.

01:10:40.787 --> 01:10:43.788
Some people think I
should leave town.

01:10:43.790 --> 01:10:45.059
Go on vacation.

01:10:46.227 --> 01:10:49.727
Wait for those mall cops
to get killed, or...

01:10:49.729 --> 01:10:52.765
Stop fucking everything up.

01:10:52.767 --> 01:10:56.668
But those people, they
don't know me very well.

01:10:56.670 --> 01:11:00.004
I don't run away from
fights, I win fights.

01:11:00.006 --> 01:11:02.106
And then I eat the
hearts of my enemies,

01:11:02.108 --> 01:11:06.912
so it's very important that
you guys pay attention.

01:11:06.914 --> 01:11:09.614
I pay each and every
one of you very good

01:11:09.616 --> 01:11:11.749
to kill anything
that gets in the way,

01:11:11.751 --> 01:11:14.252
so listen to this one thing.

01:11:14.254 --> 01:11:17.122
They are coming, they
are coming for me,

01:11:17.124 --> 01:11:18.891
and they are coming
for all of you,

01:11:18.893 --> 01:11:20.829
and they will kill you!

01:11:21.995 --> 01:11:24.799
So please, do not
let that happen.

01:11:34.107 --> 01:11:35.975
He should be back by now.

01:11:35.977 --> 01:11:38.610
This place is a maze,
he'll never find us.

01:11:38.612 --> 01:11:40.846
Well I hope he's okay.

01:11:40.848 --> 01:11:42.882
Jesus Christ.

01:11:42.884 --> 01:11:45.117
I heard you since
the last corner.

01:11:45.119 --> 01:11:47.785
Did you kill Patrick?

01:11:47.787 --> 01:11:49.821
No, let's keep moving.

01:11:49.823 --> 01:11:51.824
We should wait for backup.

01:11:51.826 --> 01:11:53.829
No, let's keep moving.

01:12:06.706 --> 01:12:07.541
Shit.

01:12:10.811 --> 01:12:14.012
You pigs are really starting
to fucking piss me off!

01:12:14.014 --> 01:12:15.980
I don't know, a lot.

01:12:15.982 --> 01:12:16.817
Fuck.

01:12:34.235 --> 01:12:35.900
Nice toss, Eddie.

01:12:35.902 --> 01:12:37.035
We gotta go, man.

01:12:37.037 --> 01:12:38.736
We gotta go right now.

01:12:38.738 --> 01:12:40.138
Look, we're not going
'til we bring Stanton in.

01:12:40.140 --> 01:12:42.708
Hey, we've got strick
orders to extract you

01:12:42.710 --> 01:12:43.775
and then get out to the front,

01:12:43.777 --> 01:12:46.177
and wait for him with the
SWAT and the military.

01:12:46.179 --> 01:12:48.047
You know I'm
not gonna do that.

01:12:48.049 --> 01:12:50.118
We can do this ourselves.

01:12:52.085 --> 01:12:53.953
Not you.

01:12:53.955 --> 01:12:55.020
Look, we have backup now.

01:12:55.022 --> 01:12:56.955
No please, I can help.

01:12:56.957 --> 01:12:58.190
Francheska, I know you can

01:12:58.192 --> 01:12:59.658
but you done enough
already, trust me.

01:12:59.660 --> 01:13:01.060
I can't leave you,
I'm not gonna do it.

01:13:01.062 --> 01:13:02.794
I need you to go to
Stanton Creed's cashew

01:13:02.796 --> 01:13:05.163
and get the money, and
meet us at our spot.

01:13:05.165 --> 01:13:06.731
Our spot, I don't understand.

01:13:06.733 --> 01:13:09.068
Just think about it.

01:13:09.070 --> 01:13:09.905
Think.

01:13:10.839 --> 01:13:12.303
Look, if Grey and I
aren't back by the time

01:13:12.305 --> 01:13:15.807
the sirens go off, get far away.

01:13:15.809 --> 01:13:18.110
You're gonna trust
her with my money?

01:13:18.112 --> 01:13:19.214
Your money?

01:13:20.380 --> 01:13:22.614
I didn't know it was
about the cash, Grey.

01:13:22.616 --> 01:13:26.787
We'll give you a distraction
so you can get away.

01:13:27.722 --> 01:13:28.557
Come on.

01:13:30.090 --> 01:13:31.026
Our spot.

01:13:38.064 --> 01:13:38.931
Everybody good?

01:13:38.933 --> 01:13:40.101
Grey, Trenton?

01:13:41.235 --> 01:13:42.668
Guns down, now!

01:13:42.670 --> 01:13:43.968
What the fuck
are you doing, Rogers?

01:13:43.970 --> 01:13:44.970
Rogers, what are you doing?

01:13:44.972 --> 01:13:47.338
Shut the fuck up!

01:13:47.340 --> 01:13:48.873
Put it down, put 'em down!

01:13:48.875 --> 01:13:50.008
Put it down, Rogers.

01:13:50.010 --> 01:13:52.677
Put the guns down now!

01:13:52.679 --> 01:13:54.148
Kick 'em over to me.

01:13:57.785 --> 01:13:58.353
Back up.

01:14:07.094 --> 01:14:08.092
What the fuck is going on?

01:14:08.094 --> 01:14:09.028
Don't ask questions.

01:14:09.030 --> 01:14:10.663
You're working with Rogers?

01:14:10.665 --> 01:14:12.830
We couldn't do this alone.

01:14:12.832 --> 01:14:14.766
This is only gonna
work if you kill Creed.

01:14:14.768 --> 01:14:17.168
Don't you worry about that.

01:14:17.170 --> 01:14:20.939
You get got, don't even
think about mentioning my name.

01:14:20.941 --> 01:14:21.873
I may be a lot of things,

01:14:21.875 --> 01:14:24.376
but a rat's not one of them.

01:14:24.378 --> 01:14:27.145
Once we get all the cash
from Stanton's operation,

01:14:27.147 --> 01:14:29.914
we'll have enough to
start our own empire.

01:14:29.916 --> 01:14:31.984
I needed someone I could trust.

01:14:31.986 --> 01:14:34.990
Someone who would
take out the boss.

01:14:35.990 --> 01:14:38.023
This had nothing to do
about your father, Grey.

01:14:38.025 --> 01:14:39.224
Oh it does.

01:14:39.226 --> 01:14:41.827
And I'm gonna kill him
and have my revenge.

01:14:41.829 --> 01:14:44.062
But I want more than vengeance.

01:14:44.064 --> 01:14:46.164
I want everything.

01:14:46.166 --> 01:14:49.034
I just had to cut a few
deals to make it happen.

01:14:49.036 --> 01:14:50.905
All this effort...

01:14:52.772 --> 01:14:56.175
This is how you
want it to be, Grey?

01:14:56.177 --> 01:14:57.112
You got me.

01:14:58.179 --> 01:15:00.779
You got me Grey, shoot me.

01:15:00.781 --> 01:15:02.247
Shoot me!

01:15:02.249 --> 01:15:04.419
I'm not gonna shoot you!

01:15:05.786 --> 01:15:07.185
You hit like a bitch.

01:15:07.187 --> 01:15:09.790
Shut the fuck up!

01:15:18.432 --> 01:15:22.167
The son of the
father I murdered.

01:15:22.169 --> 01:15:23.101
I should've hunted you down

01:15:23.103 --> 01:15:25.837
and killed you a long time ago.

01:15:25.839 --> 01:15:28.740
But I suppose the past
catches up with all of us,

01:15:28.742 --> 01:15:30.077
sooner or later.

01:15:35.515 --> 01:15:37.449
Do you remember, huh?

01:15:37.451 --> 01:15:41.823
What it what was like before
it all went to shit, do you?

01:15:48.995 --> 01:15:50.962
That's good, you think...

01:15:50.964 --> 01:15:54.166
You think I'm afraid of dying?

01:15:54.168 --> 01:15:55.501
Here we are.

01:15:55.503 --> 01:15:57.903
Good guy and the bad guy.

01:15:57.905 --> 01:15:59.471
Same old story, only
this time the ending

01:15:59.473 --> 01:16:02.377
doesn't look too
promising for you.

01:16:35.442 --> 01:16:36.874
There's no way around it.

01:16:36.876 --> 01:16:40.546
You make it quick, or
you can make it painful.

01:16:40.548 --> 01:16:42.446
That's up to you.

01:16:42.448 --> 01:16:43.382
Let me go!

01:16:43.384 --> 01:16:45.453
That's up to you!

01:16:48.822 --> 01:16:49.456
Fuck.

01:16:58.299 --> 01:17:00.399
No wait Grey, Grey!

01:17:05.577 --> 01:17:08.172
