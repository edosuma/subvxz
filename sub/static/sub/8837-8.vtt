WELL, MAYBE FRED

12:36.964 --> 12:38.131
Caroline:
HE PROBABLY
WOULD...

12:38.299 --> 12:40.216
AFTER HE ATE
THE TOMATOES,
THE SQUASH,

12:40.384 --> 12:42.302
THE PEAS,
AND THE BEETS.

12:42.470 --> 12:44.721
YOUR MOTHER'S RIGHT.
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO DO BETTER THAN THAT.

12:44.889 --> 12:46.514
Mary: OH, PA...
I LOOKED UP
CATTAIL LEAVES

12:46.682 --> 12:48.224
IN A BOOK
AT SCHOOL TODAY.

12:48.392 --> 12:52.228
THEY USE THEM TO MAKE
CHAIR SEATS AND ALL
KINDS OF FINE FURNITURE.

12:52.396 --> 12:53.688
I FRANKLY DON'T CARE
WHAT THEY DO WITH THEM,

12:53.856 --> 12:55.273
AS LONG AS I JUST SELL
THEM TO PHINEAS JENKS,

12:55.441 --> 12:58.985
GET RID OF THEM,
AND GET MY $8.00.

12:59.153 --> 13:00.487
OHH.

13:02.239 --> 13:05.909
THAT BED'S GOING TO LOOK
AWFUL GOOD TO ME TONIGHT.

13:06.076 --> 13:07.160
Laura: PA?

13:07.328 --> 13:10.079
DID YOU KNOW THAT FRED
WAS A VERY SPECIAL GOAT?

13:10.247 --> 13:12.582
HE'S THE LAST
OF HIS KIND.

13:12.750 --> 13:14.334
I CERTAINLY HOPE SO.

13:20.966 --> 13:22.926
[BLEATS]

13:33.604 --> 13:37.023
MARY...ARE YOU AWAKE?

13:37.191 --> 13:39.234
NO.

13:39.401 --> 13:43.321
IF YOU WERE ASLEEP,
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
SAID, "NO."

13:48.452 --> 13:50.286
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS?

13:50.454 --> 13:52.497
I MEAN, ABOUT FRED.

13:52.665 --> 13:55.416
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING
A GOAT CAN DO.

13:55.584 --> 13:58.419
SEEMS LIKE HE'S DONE
TOO MUCH ALREADY.

13:58.587 --> 14:00.296
NOT BAD THINGS...

14:00.464 --> 14:02.799
I MEAN GOOD THINGS.

14:02.967 --> 14:06.094
WELL, I'VE READ WHERE
THEY MAKE REAL EXPENSIVE
PURSES AND GLOVES

14:06.262 --> 14:07.595
OUT OF GOAT LEATHER.

14:07.763 --> 14:10.640
- MARY!
- I'M SORRY.

14:10.808 --> 14:14.686
ANYWAY, WORRYING ABOUT
IT WON'T DO MUCH GOOD.

14:14.854 --> 14:17.313
AND MAYBE PA WILL
FEEL BETTER ABOUT FRED
IN THE MORNING...

14:17.481 --> 14:19.774
AFTER HE'S HAD
A GOOD REST.

14:19.942 --> 14:21.192
GOOD NIGHT, LAURA.

14:21.360 --> 14:23.862
YEAH.
GOOD NIGHT, MARY.

14:32.621 --> 14:34.163
[YAWNING]

14:34.331 --> 14:36.165
OHH.

14:36.333 --> 14:37.500
HMM.

14:37.668 --> 14:40.962
WHY DON'T YOU
SLEEP IN TOMORROW?
AT LEAST UNTIL 6.

14:41.130 --> 14:43.631
HMM...I WISH I COULD,
BUT I CAN'T.

14:43.799 --> 14:46.759
HARVESTING THOSE RUSHES
HAS GOT ME WAY BEHIND
IN THE REST OF MY WORK.

14:46.927 --> 14:49.178
I'LL BE FINE.
DON'T WORRY.

14:49.346 --> 14:50.346
Both: HMM...

14:50.514 --> 14:51.973
YOU HAVE
A GOOD SLEEP.

15:15.039 --> 15:16.122
[CRASH]
AAH!

15:16.290 --> 15:17.457
OH, NO.

[BARKS]

15:32.056 --> 15:33.681
COME BACK HERE!
STAY THERE!

15:33.849 --> 15:35.350
I DON'T WANT YOU
SCARING FRED.

15:35.517 --> 15:36.559
BE BACK
IN A MINUTE, MA.

15:36.727 --> 15:39.437
I HAVE TO FEED FRED
HIS BREAKFAST.

15:42.107 --> 15:46.361
OH, NO.

15:46.528 --> 15:47.570
FRED!

15:47.738 --> 15:49.948
[FRED BLEATS]

16:01.710 --> 16:03.086
OH, NO!

16:04.713 --> 16:07.048
HOW COULD YOU
DO THIS?

16:07.216 --> 16:09.467
HERE...COME HERE.

16:09.635 --> 16:11.427
COME ON.

16:13.555 --> 16:15.223
YOU KNOW IT'S GOING
TO TAKE ME HOURS
IN THAT SWAMP

16:15.391 --> 16:17.642
TO REPLACE WHAT
HE'S EATEN SO FAR?

16:17.810 --> 16:19.102
IT WAS MY FAULT, PA.

16:19.269 --> 16:21.771
I SHOULD'VE
FED FRED SOONER.

16:21.939 --> 16:23.189
HALF-PINT, THERE COMES
A TIME IN EVERYBODY'S LIFE

16:23.357 --> 16:24.565
WHEN THEY HAVE
TO FACE THE FACTS,

16:24.733 --> 16:26.109
AND THE FACTS ARE THAT
THAT GOAT IS DESTRUCTIVE,

16:26.276 --> 16:28.903
THAT GOAT IS A MENACE,
AND THAT GOAT IS GOING TO GO!

16:29.071 --> 16:30.613
BUT, PA, IF WE BUILD
A PLACE FOR HIM--

16:30.781 --> 16:32.156
NO IFS, ANDS, OR BUTS.

16:32.324 --> 16:34.993
I WANT THAT GOAT GONE,
AND I WANT HIM GONE TODAY.

16:35.160 --> 16:36.536
[FRED BURPS]

16:39.915 --> 16:41.416
TODAY.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.628
NOW SEE
WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

16:48.632 --> 16:50.216
OH! DAD BURN IT!

16:52.970 --> 16:54.929
JACK, WILL YOU
GET AWAY FROM ME?

16:58.600 --> 16:59.600
[HUMMING]

16:59.768 --> 17:01.144
OLD DAN TUCKER
WAS A FINE OLD MAN

17:01.311 --> 17:02.603
WASHED HIS FACE
IN A FRYING PAN

17:02.771 --> 17:04.522
COMBED HIS HAIR
WITH A WAGON WHEEL

17:04.690 --> 17:06.274
DIED WITH A TOOTHACHE
IN HIS HEEL

17:06.442 --> 17:07.984
GET OUT OF THE WAY
FOR OLD DAN TUCKER

17:08.152 --> 17:09.652
IT'S TOO LATE
TO GET YOUR SUPPER

17:09.820 --> 17:11.320
SUPPER'S OVER
AND DINNER COOKIN'

17:11.488 --> 17:14.615

A-STANDIN' THERE LOOKIN'

18:03.040 --> 18:04.499

18:09.546 --> 18:10.713
WHAT IN SASSAFRAS--

18:10.881 --> 18:12.840
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
SNEAKING UP ON A MAN
LIKE THAT?

18:13.008 --> 18:14.675
I WASN'T SNEAKING...

18:14.843 --> 18:16.719
JUST WALKING SOFT,
THE WAY YOU TAUGHT ME.

18:16.887 --> 18:18.012
OH.

18:18.180 --> 18:19.180
WHAT YOU DOING?

18:19.348 --> 18:20.389
I'M SUPPOSED
TO ASK YOU THAT.

18:20.557 --> 18:21.557
AIN'T YOU SUPPOSED
TO BE IN SCHOOL?

18:21.725 --> 18:23.226
THAT'S WHERE
I WAS GOING.

18:23.393 --> 18:25.394
I SAW YOU AND THOUGHT
MAYBE YOU FOUND A NEW
SHORTCUT TO TOWN.

18:25.562 --> 18:27.438
NOW, YOU FESS UP.
YOU THOUGHT I WAS GOING
FISHING, DIDN'T YOU?

18:27.606 --> 18:28.815
I GUESS I WAS HOPING.

18:28.982 --> 18:31.400
I AIN'T GOT TIME
FOR FISHING TODAY.
TOO BUSY.

18:31.568 --> 18:33.820
I'M TOO BUSY FOR A PASSEL
OF QUESTIONS, TOO,
SO YOU JUST GO ON.

18:33.987 --> 18:35.404
GET ON TO SCHOOL.
GO ON.

18:35.572 --> 18:37.907
NOW, HOLD ON THERE
JUST A MINUTE.

18:38.075 --> 18:40.576
WHAT I'M DOING HERE...
THIS, UH...

18:40.744 --> 18:41.869
THIS IS
KIND OF A SECRET.

18:42.037 --> 18:44.080
YOU MEAN YOU DON'T
WANT ME TO TELL MA?

18:44.248 --> 18:46.124
WELL, IT...IT DON'T
JUST MEAN YOUR MA.

18:46.291 --> 18:47.416
SEE, I DON'T WANT
YOU TELLING ANYBODY

18:47.584 --> 18:49.460
ABOUT THIS PLACE
OR WHAT I'M DOING.

18:49.628 --> 18:51.504
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

18:51.672 --> 18:52.672
OH.

18:52.840 --> 18:54.966
WELL, UM...
I'M INVENTING.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.218
THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING.
I'M INVENTING IN HERE.

18:57.386 --> 19:00.930
HAD SOMETHING IN MY HEAD.
THOUGHT I'D GIVE HER A TRY.

19:01.098 --> 19:02.306
SURE SMELLS BAD.

19:02.474 --> 19:04.433
WELL, YOU GOT TO
PUT UP WITH SOME
OF THAT AT FIRST.

19:04.601 --> 19:07.478
AFTER I GET IT FINISHED,
IT'LL SMELL FINE.

19:09.606 --> 19:10.606
WHAT IS IT?

19:10.774 --> 19:12.859
OH, IT'S A...A...

19:13.026 --> 19:14.986
IT'S A NEW BRAND
OF TURPENTINE.
THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

19:15.154 --> 19:16.445
IT'S VERY DANGEROUS.

19:16.613 --> 19:19.198
IT'S, UH...IT'S GOING TO
BE A BOON TO MANKIND--

19:19.366 --> 19:21.409
THIN PAINT, TAKE SPOTS
OUT OF YOUR CLOTHES,

19:21.577 --> 19:24.078
AND THE SNAP OUT
OF YOUR SUSPENDERS.

19:24.246 --> 19:25.746
WILL IT TAKE THE PITCH
OFF MY HANDS?

19:25.914 --> 19:29.208
IT'S A MITE STRONG
FOR THAT. LIKELY TO
BURN HOLES IN YOU.

19:29.376 --> 19:30.459
I'LL STAY CLEAR
FROM IT.

19:30.627 --> 19:32.795

WITH A WAGON WHEEL

19:44.016 --> 19:45.558

IN HIS HEEL

19:45.726 --> 19:48.644
GET OUT OF THE WAY

20:15.964 --> 20:17.924
I GOT SOMETHING
SPECIAL TO SHOW YOU.

20:18.091 --> 20:19.634
WHAT'S THAT THING?

20:19.801 --> 20:20.927
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"THING"?

20:21.094 --> 20:23.512
IT'S A GOAT, AND
A VERY SPECIAL GOAT.

20:23.680 --> 20:25.848
THE LAST
OF HIS KIND.

20:26.016 --> 20:28.476
CAN'T BE SO SPECIAL
IF YOU OWN HIM.

20:28.644 --> 20:30.311
WHAT GOOD'S A GOAT,
ANYWAY?

20:30.479 --> 20:32.647
A LOT YOU KNOW,
WILLIE OLESON.

20:32.814 --> 20:35.650
WHY, A GOAT LIKE
THIS IS PRACTICALLY
PRICELESS.

20:35.817 --> 20:36.943
I COULDN'T EVEN
BEGIN TO TELL YOU

20:37.110 --> 20:38.778
ALL THE THINGS
HE'S GOOD FOR.

20:38.946 --> 20:40.821
YEAH? NAME ONE.

20:40.989 --> 20:44.116
WELL, THERE'S
NOTHING LIKE A GOAT FOR
PROTECTING YOUR BARN.

20:44.284 --> 20:47.536
WE AIN'T GOT A BARN.

20:47.704 --> 20:50.373
WELL...
THEN THERE'S CHEESE.

20:50.540 --> 20:51.791
EVERYBODY KNOWS
THAT GOAT'S MILK

20:51.959 --> 20:54.877
MAKES JUST ABOUT
THE BEST CHEESE
THAT THERE IS.

20:55.045 --> 20:58.547
CHEESE...I GUESS
I SORT OF LIKE CHEESE.

20:58.715 --> 21:01.342
THAT'S REGULAR CHEESE
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

21:01.510 --> 21:03.719
BUT GOAT'S CHEESE IS
BETTER THAN ANYTHING.

21:03.887 --> 21:08.391
IT'S SO YUMMY,
YOU'LL NEVER WANT
TO EAT ANYTHING ELSE.

21:08.558 --> 21:10.559
WELL, I'D BEST BE
GETTING TO SCHOOL.

21:10.727 --> 21:11.894
COME ON, FRED.

21:12.062 --> 21:14.939

21:15.107 --> 21:18.150
I WANT TO HEAR SOME MORE
ABOUT THAT GOAT CHEESE.

21:18.318 --> 21:22.071
BOY, THAT LAURA INGALLS
THINKS SHE'S SO SMART.

21:22.239 --> 21:24.573
I JUST PUT ONE OVER
ON HER, MA.

21:24.741 --> 21:29.245
I TALKED HER INTO SELLING ME
THIS HERE GENUINE GOAT

21:29.413 --> 21:31.038
FOR PRACTICALLY NOTHING.

21:31.206 --> 21:33.666
UH-HUH.
THAT'S NICE, DEAR.

21:33.834 --> 21:36.419
ONLY YOU SHOULDN'T
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HER.

21:36.586 --> 21:39.672
AFTER ALL, WE'RE
THE BUSINESS PEOPLE,
AND SHE'S NOT.

21:39.840 --> 21:40.923
BUSINESS IS RIGHT!

21:41.091 --> 21:43.884
I'M GOING TO MAKE
A FORTUNE SELLING CHEESE.

21:44.052 --> 21:46.262
UH-HUH.
THAT'S NICE, DEAR.

21:46.430 --> 21:47.722
YOU BETTER HURRY ON
NOW TO SCHOOL,

21:47.889 --> 21:49.307
OR YOU'RE GOING

22:12.080 --> 22:13.748
YOU MEAN
YOU OWNED A GOAT?

22:13.915 --> 22:15.666
AN HONEST-TO-GOODNESS
GOAT?

22:15.834 --> 22:18.294
YEP. AND I NAMED
HIM FRED.

22:18.462 --> 22:20.004
AND YOU SOLD HIM
TO WILLIE?

22:20.172 --> 22:22.631
BOY, IF I OWNED A GOAT,
I'D NEVER SELL HIM.

22:22.799 --> 22:23.799
WELL, I SORT OF
HAD TO.

23:50.053 --> 23:52.138
WELL, I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT HAPPENED.

23:52.305 --> 23:55.975

FOISTED OFF
ON MY POOR WILLIE.

24:01.648 --> 24:04.108
I DIDN'T SWINDLE
WILLIE, MRS. OLESON.

24:04.276 --> 24:05.276
DID SO!

24:05.444 --> 24:08.028
HOW'D SHE
DO IT, MA?

24:08.196 --> 24:11.449
A BILLY GOAT...
TO MAKE CHEESE?

24:11.616 --> 24:13.159
- OH.
- OH.

24:13.326 --> 24:14.326
OH!

24:14.494 --> 24:15.536

MY STUFF!

24:15.704 --> 24:17.413

9 CENTS, AND A GENUINE
BARLOW KNIFE.

IT'S ALL THERE.

24:24.129 --> 24:25.796
AND I DIDN'T
CHEAT YOU!

24:25.964 --> 24:29.091
DID SO! AND YOU
CAN HAVE YOUR
OLD GOAT BACK.

24:29.259 --> 24:30.426
WHERE IS HE?

24:30.594 --> 24:34.305
HUH! THAT, YOUNG LADY,
IS YOUR CONCERN.

24:35.515 --> 24:36.765
I'M NOT SURE WHAT
THIS IS ALL ABOUT,

24:36.933 --> 24:38.642
BUT I DO KNOW IT'S TIME
TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL.

24:38.810 --> 24:40.769
COME ON, CHILDREN.

24:47.694 --> 24:48.777
OH, NO!

24:48.945 --> 24:49.904
MY ESSAY!

24:50.071 --> 24:51.780
LAURA, GET THAT
GOAT OUT OF HERE!

24:51.948 --> 24:53.449
HE'S EATEN MY ESSAY.

24:53.617 --> 24:55.367
[CHILDREN LAUGHING]

24:55.535 --> 24:56.744

25:00.123 --> 25:02.208
TAKE HIM, LAURA.

25:02.375 --> 25:04.210
[FRED BLEATS]

25:04.377 --> 25:05.711
MY ESSAY.

25:39.913 --> 25:42.581
I KNOW HOW YOU
FEEL, LAURA.

25:42.749 --> 25:44.708
BUT I LIKE FRED.

25:46.336 --> 25:49.004
YOU'RE ABOUT
THE ONLY ONE.

25:49.172 --> 25:52.299
EVEN MY SISTER
IS MAD AT HIM.

25:52.467 --> 25:56.178
BEING POPULAR JUST
AIN'T ONE OF HIS
MAIN POINTS.

25:58.807 --> 26:01.058
WHAT AM I GOING
TO DO WITH HIM?

26:01.226 --> 26:03.394
I CAN'T TAKE
HIM BACK HOME.

26:03.562 --> 26:05.354
OR BACK
TO MR. PARSONS.

26:05.522 --> 26:09.441
OR...OR ANYWHERE
AS FAR AS I CAN THINK.

26:11.361 --> 26:12.444
THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMEONE

26:12.612 --> 26:15.197
WHO WOULD LIKE
A NICE GOAT LIKE FRED.

26:15.365 --> 26:18.200
LOOK, WE ASKED ALL
THE KIDS IN SCHOOL

26:18.368 --> 26:21.078
AND THEY ALL SAID NO.

26:21.246 --> 26:23.539
CAN'T BLAME THEM
FOR BACKING OFF...

26:23.707 --> 26:28.043
AFTER SEEING WHAT FRED
DID TO MARY'S ESSAY
AND MRS. OLESON.

26:28.211 --> 26:30.254
HE DIDN'T MEAN
TO BE BAD.

26:30.422 --> 26:33.549
PEOPLE JUST DON'T
UNDERSTAND HIM,
THAT'S ALL.

26:33.717 --> 26:36.385
THAT'S IT!
MY PA!

26:38.054 --> 26:40.889
DO YOU THINK YOUR PA
WOULD LET US KEEP FRED
AT YOUR PLACE?

26:41.057 --> 26:43.309
THERE AIN'T NO ONE
LIKES ANIMALS LIKE PA.

26:43.476 --> 26:45.686
COME ON!

26:45.854 --> 26:46.895
PA HAS A WAY
WITH CRITTERS.

26:47.063 --> 26:48.397
WHY, OLD FRED'LL
TAKE TO PA

26:48.565 --> 26:51.859
LIKE THAT DAMON
AND PYTHIAS BOOK
WE'VE BEEN READING.

26:52.027 --> 26:54.862
HEY, I BET
YOU'RE RIGHT!

26:55.030 --> 26:57.781
I REMEMBER MY PA SAYING
THAT YOUR PA

26:57.949 --> 27:01.160
SWEET-TALKED A BEAR
OUT OF A HONEY TREE ONCE.

27:09.461 --> 27:10.628
HI, PA!

27:10.795 --> 27:12.171
HELLO, SON!

27:16.718 --> 27:20.095
YES, SIR, FRED,
YOU DONE FOUND
YOURSELF A NEW HOME.

27:25.352 --> 27:27.561
FRED, NO!

27:27.729 --> 27:29.063
WHOA!

27:33.526 --> 27:37.488
THERE'S ANOTHER IDEA
THAT SURE DIDN'T LAST LONG.

27:37.656 --> 27:40.157
IT'S GETTING NEAR

WE GOING TO DO NOW?

27:44.412 --> 27:45.663
TOMORROW'S SATURDAY.

27:45.830 --> 27:48.040
WE'LL HAVE MOST ALL THE DAY
TO THINK OF SOMETHING.

27:48.208 --> 27:50.626
BUT WHAT ARE WE
GOING TO DO WITH HIM
FOR TONIGHT?

27:50.794 --> 27:52.878
I'VE BEEN THINKING
SOME ON THAT, TOO.

27:53.046 --> 27:56.799
I KNOW A REAL GOOD PLACE,
BUT YOU GOT TO PROMISE
YOU'LL NEVER TELL.

27:56.966 --> 27:58.300
SURE! BUT--

27:58.468 --> 27:59.968
CROSS YOUR HEART?

28:00.136 --> 28:01.637
WORD OF HONOR?

28:01.805 --> 28:04.390
HOPE THE RATS
WILL EAT YOU UP?

28:04.557 --> 28:06.308
I WON'T
TELL ANYBODY.

28:06.476 --> 28:09.061

A REAL SECRET

28:17.987 --> 28:19.071
HOW'D YOU FIND IT?

28:19.239 --> 28:20.322
PA FIXED IT UP.

28:20.490 --> 28:23.492
I FOUND HIM
HERE ONE DAY,
ACCIDENTAL LIKE.

28:23.660 --> 28:25.285
IT'S HIS
THINKING PLACE.

28:25.453 --> 28:27.913
HE MADE ME PROMISE
NOT TO TELL ANYBODY
ABOUT IT,

28:28.081 --> 28:29.790
BUT THIS HERE'S
AN EMERGENCY.

28:29.958 --> 28:32.751

BE JUST FINE
FOR ONE NIGHT HERE.

28:34.129 --> 28:37.131
WHAT'S THIS CROCK
AND STUFF FOR?

28:37.298 --> 28:41.009
PA SAID HE'S
INVENTING SOME NEW
KIND OF TURPENTINE.

28:41.177 --> 28:43.011
I WASN'T SUPPOSED
TO TELL ABOUT THAT,
EITHER.

28:43.179 --> 28:46.849
THEY USE RAISINS AND SUGAR
TO MAKE TURPENTINE?

28:47.016 --> 28:49.727
I GUESS MY PA DOES.

28:49.894 --> 28:50.936
IT'S GETTING DARK.

28:51.104 --> 28:53.522
WE'D BEST BEAT IT
ON HOME.

28:53.690 --> 28:55.691
GOOD-BYE, FRED.
DON'T YOU FRET.

28:55.859 --> 28:58.944
WE'LL BE BACK

30 POUNDS HERE, INGALLS?

29:16.671 --> 29:19.089
I GAVE YOU FULL MEASURE,

YOU'RE SATISFIED.
I'D LIKE MY MONEY.

WELL, NOW, INGALLS,
I HATE TO SAY THIS,

29:28.391 --> 29:30.768
BUT THE BEST
I CAN DO IS $5.00.

29:30.935 --> 29:32.603
WHAT DO YOU MEAN $5.00?
YOU PROMISED ME 8!

29:32.771 --> 29:35.731
IT AIN'T MY FAULT.

A DEAL WITH A MAN,

IN WRITING, INGALLS.

OR LEAVE IT.

THESE OATS,

OLD GOAT LIKE FRED.

FIND OUT THAT HE'S

TAKE CARE OF HIM?

OF EVERYTHING.

WAS LEAVE HIM.

WILL TAKE CARE OF HIM.

CLOSEST TO GOD?

36:07.874 --> 36:10.458
SETTING THE ROOM UP
FOR CHURCH TOMORROW.

36:10.626 --> 36:13.044
IF THERE'S ANYBODY
THAT CAN HELP US,
IT'LL BE HIM.

36:13.212 --> 36:15.380
WE BETTER GO NOW.
COME ON.

36:17.466 --> 36:19.384
COME ON, FRED.

36:21.387 --> 36:26.057
YES, LOVE ALL CREATURES,
GREAT AND SMALL.

36:26.225 --> 36:28.894
THAT IS A GREAT LESSON
FROM THE LORD.

36:29.061 --> 36:32.189
IT TELLS US IN THE BIBLE
THAT THE LORD
GAVE MAN DOMINION

36:32.356 --> 36:35.650
OVER THE FISH OF THE SEA
AND OVER THE BIRDS OF THE AIR

36:35.818 --> 36:37.152
AND OVER THE CATTLE...

36:37.320 --> 36:39.696
AND OVER EVERYTHING
THAT MOVETH ON THE EARTH.

36:39.864 --> 36:41.990
Both: AHEM.

36:43.534 --> 36:46.494
WELL, THIS IS
A NICE SURPRISE
ON THIS FINE DAY.

36:46.662 --> 36:48.830
CAN'T STAY AWAY FROM SCHOOL
EVEN ON SATURDAY?

36:48.998 --> 36:51.791
YES, SIR.
I MEAN, NO, SIR.

36:51.959 --> 36:53.335
WE CAME TO SEE YOU.

36:53.502 --> 36:55.378
ABOUT FRED.

36:55.546 --> 36:57.130
FRED?

36:57.298 --> 37:00.133
YOU SEE,
NOBODY LIKES FRED.

37:00.301 --> 37:02.427
ME AND CARL,
WE LIKE HIM,

37:02.595 --> 37:04.387
BUT MY PA
DOESN'T LIKE HIM,

37:04.555 --> 37:06.765
AND CARL'S PA
DOESN'T LIKE HIM.

37:06.933 --> 37:08.683
MARY DON'T LIKE HIM.

37:08.851 --> 37:11.770
MRS. OLESON
CAN'T STAND HIM,

37:11.938 --> 37:14.356
AND MR. PARSONS WAS
GOING TO SHOOT HIM.

37:14.523 --> 37:17.192
DOC BAKER DOESN'T
EXACTLY HUNKER
TO HIM, EITHER.

37:17.360 --> 37:19.361
OH, COME, COME.
SURELY YOU EXAGGERATE.

37:19.528 --> 37:21.029
THOSE FOLKS YOU MENTIONED,
I KNOW THEM WELL.

37:21.197 --> 37:22.656
THEY'RE GOOD PEOPLE.

37:22.823 --> 37:26.409
THEY HAVE ROOM IN
THEIR HEART FOR COMPASSION
AND UNDERSTANDING.

37:27.870 --> 37:31.039
WELL, I THINK MOST
FOLKS HAVE RUN OUT
OF ROOM FOR FRED.

37:34.543 --> 37:36.169
THIS FRED...

37:36.337 --> 37:37.837
I DON'T KNOW ANY FRED.

37:38.005 --> 37:40.382
IS HE NEW
TO WALNUT GROVE?

37:40.549 --> 37:45.720

ON THAT COMPASSION
AND UNDERSTANDING STUFF.

38:05.992 --> 38:08.827
WELL, THAT'S WHAT
MADE ME MAKE UP MY MIND.

38:08.995 --> 38:11.413
IF FRED CAN'T GET ALONG
WITH A MINISTER, WELL...

38:11.580 --> 38:13.707
WE JUST GOT TO DO IT,
THAT'S ALL.

38:13.874 --> 38:17.544

AS GOOD A PLACE AS ANY.

THERE'S LOTS
OF GRASS.

38:29.181 --> 38:32.309
THERE'S A BROOK
TO DRINK FROM.

38:32.476 --> 38:33.768
I CAN'T DO IT.

38:33.936 --> 38:35.312
YOU HAVE TO.

38:35.479 --> 38:36.563
YOU EVEN SAID YOURSELF,

38:36.731 --> 38:40.608
HE CAN'T EVEN GET ALONG
WITH A MINISTER.

38:40.776 --> 38:42.736
SOMEONE'S
GOT TO LOVE HIM.

38:42.903 --> 38:46.740

WITH BISCUITS AND GRAVY.

38:46.907 --> 38:50.243
I'M SORRY, LAURA.
YOU BETTER SAY GOOD-BYE.

THERE'S JUST
THE TWO OF US.

HIS MIND.

ANOTHER SCHEME

I'M INTERESTED.

42:03.062 --> 42:06.314

42:08.150 --> 42:10.443
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE
WHAT HAPPENED, INGALLS.

42:10.611 --> 42:13.613
IT WAS ET BY A GREAT,
EVIL, MONSTROUS GOAT

42:13.781 --> 42:14.948
WHILE I WAS SLEEPING.

42:15.115 --> 42:18.284
