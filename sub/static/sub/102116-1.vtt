Thank you.

28:33.178 --> 28:35.613
Uh, you said missing.

This morning at the station,
you didn't-- you didn't
mention a struggle.

28:38.783 --> 28:40.151
Well, I tried to tell you.

28:40.218 --> 28:41.920
But then all those

your husband was missing?

28:47.859 --> 28:49.294
I realized Karl
hadn't come home last night.

28:49.360 --> 28:51.196
And then I came down
and saw the kitchen

28:51.262 --> 28:53.164

-And I knew something
was wrong.

No. I...
Well, it was my birthday,

29:01.172 --> 29:03.408
and we had dinner reservations
at La Femme Aimée.

29:03.475 --> 29:05.910

French restaurant downtown.

29:05.977 --> 29:08.046
But I was exhausted
when I got home,

29:08.113 --> 29:10.648
so I went upstairs
to close my eyes for a minute
and do some affirmations,

29:10.715 --> 29:12.951
and I knew something was wrong
'cause Karl never woke me.

29:13.017 --> 29:14.419
And I came downstairs,
and then I saw this,

29:14.486 --> 29:17.355
and Karl was gone.

29:19.958 --> 29:21.559

45:24.154 --> 45:27.725
and that's when I...
I put two and two together.

45:27.791 --> 45:30.894
GLORIA: Even if you
didn't know who Emma Rose--

45:30.961 --> 45:35.132
Hey, Sue. Didn't you know
who Emma Rose was?

45:35.199 --> 45:36.500
What?

45:36.567 --> 45:38.035
Before you went
to Gloria Michaels,

45:38.102 --> 45:39.770
when you and I were together,

45:39.837 --> 45:40.971
you called her
"the missing girl."

45:42.106 --> 45:43.841
That was Emma Rose's
parents on the phone.

45:43.907 --> 45:45.742
Wow. Wait, what--
What did they want?

45:45.809 --> 45:49.646
They-they want to meet me...
to talk.

45:49.713 --> 45:51.115
Okay, I know what to do.

45:51.181 --> 45:53.317
We're-we're gonna do
a joint interview

45:53.383 --> 45:55.085
while there's still buzz about
a possible connection

45:55.152 --> 45:56.353
between Karl and Emma.

45:56.420 --> 45:58.055
I-- I don't know.

45:58.122 --> 46:00.524
Sue, the media
is your best friend right now.

46:00.591 --> 46:03.193
The bigger the story,

46:03.260 --> 46:05.796
the bigger the chances
of finding Karl and Emma.

46:07.397 --> 46:08.665
Okay.

46:08.732 --> 46:10.868
Yes! Ooh! Yes, yes, yes!

46:10.934 --> 46:12.669
Okay, I'm gonna do
the whole thing,

46:12.736 --> 46:15.205
and we're gonna
solve this together.

Hi.

47:21.104 --> 47:22.239
What can I get you?

47:23.073 --> 47:24.841
I want a new TV.

47:24.908 --> 47:27.044
Do I know you from somewhere?

47:27.911 --> 47:29.613
You look very familiar.

47:34.785 --> 47:36.854
Oh, bless your heart.

47:36.920 --> 47:39.423
Your husband Karl
was kidnapped.

47:39.489 --> 47:41.024
That's right.

47:42.559 --> 47:44.628
I want to make love
to this bag of bling.

47:44.695 --> 47:47.231
We should keep some
for our ladies.

47:47.297 --> 47:48.832
Deb would have
sex with me so hard

47:48.899 --> 47:50.601
if I gave her a diamond.

47:50.667 --> 47:52.302
No, come on. You can't keep
the shit you steal.

47:52.369 --> 47:53.537
That's how
they catch you, okay?

47:53.604 --> 47:54.838
Karl and I would

47:54.905 --> 47:57.641
watch TV together every morning,

47:57.708 --> 48:00.677
and our TV was destroyed
during the abduction.

48:00.744 --> 48:04.248
And I just want something
to go back to normal.

48:05.115 --> 48:06.583
Do you think I'm crazy?

48:06.650 --> 48:08.118
Oh, no. Not at all.

48:08.185 --> 48:11.054
I can't imagine
what you're going through.

48:11.121 --> 48:13.890
I tell you,
if anybody ever hurt my Rita,

48:13.957 --> 48:16.126
I would stab 'em
right in the heart.

48:16.193 --> 48:18.128
Now let's get you a TV.

48:18.195 --> 48:19.896
Okay. Okay.

48:19.963 --> 48:21.498
This looks like at least
20 grand, right?

48:21.565 --> 48:24.601
So I'll set a drop,
I'll give them the jewels,

48:24.668 --> 48:26.203
I'll get Karl.

lead with that.

what his kids think.

I will tell your husband.

how you caught us cheating,

I mean, the community
has been really supportive.

Yeah. Who's the lady
you were talking to?

54:42.512 --> 54:44.047

54:44.114 --> 54:46.349
That didn't look like
a friendly conversation.

Well, she hasn't made the time

54:48.585 --> 54:50.320
to show her support
like others have.

My friend Janet,
she made me a casserole.

54:52.555 --> 54:53.857
Oh, I love a casserole.

54:53.923 --> 54:55.592
I shouldn't have
snapped at her.

54:55.659 --> 54:57.394
It's just,
I can't expect everyone

54:57.460 --> 54:58.728
to drop their lives
and rush to my aid

54:58.795 --> 55:00.830
because my husband is missing.

55:00.897 --> 55:04.601
Yeah. So listen, do you
have any new information for me?
Hm?

55:04.668 --> 55:06.569

find it out on the news tonight

-with the rest of the world?
-Oh.

to celebrate
your birthday that night,

1:26:00.054 --> 1:26:01.689
Get on your fucking knees,

1:26:01.756 --> 1:26:03.725
and put your hands
above your head!

1:26:04.926 --> 1:26:06.528
I... You saved me.

1:26:06.594 --> 1:26:08.329
I'm gonna tell them
you saved me

1:26:08.396 --> 1:26:09.831
at the--
at the next press conference.

1:26:09.898 --> 1:26:11.332
No more press conferences
for you, Sue!

1:26:11.399 --> 1:26:13.568
-(GRUNTS)
-(HARRIS SCREAMS)

1:26:14.636 --> 1:26:16.004
-(SCREAMS)
-SUE: No, no, no...

1:26:16.070 --> 1:26:17.172
No, no.

1:26:17.238 --> 1:26:18.540
(HARRIS GROANING)

1:26:18.606 --> 1:26:20.942
No, no, no, no. I'm sorry.

1:26:21.009 --> 1:26:22.577
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1:26:22.644 --> 1:26:24.245
I didn't mean
for any of this to happen.

1:26:24.312 --> 1:26:25.813
I didn't.

1:26:25.880 --> 1:26:29.050
I'll tell everyone
that you saved me,

1:26:29.117 --> 1:26:31.052
and you'll be famous

1:26:31.119 --> 1:26:33.555
and no one will forget you.

1:26:33.621 --> 1:26:35.356
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

1:26:35.957 --> 1:26:37.191
Fuck you.

1:26:37.258 --> 1:26:38.927
(GROANING)

1:27:19.467 --> 1:27:22.403
SUE: My story matters.

1:27:22.470 --> 1:27:24.505
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

1:27:27.008 --> 1:27:28.276
I am enough.

1:27:30.311 --> 1:27:32.046
(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING)

1:27:37.385 --> 1:27:39.487
I am confident.

1:27:42.757 --> 1:27:45.693
My life
is unfolding beautifully.

1:27:45.760 --> 1:27:48.830
REPORTER: This is Channel Five
with breaking news.

1:27:48.896 --> 1:27:53.468
Thirteen-year-old Emma Rose
was found alive and well today

1:27:53.534 --> 1:27:56.104
at a bus stop
in Miami, Florida.

1:27:56.170 --> 1:27:57.972
Her relieved family says

1:27:58.039 --> 1:28:00.975
she had apparently run away
from home.

1:28:01.042 --> 1:28:03.745
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

1:28:03.811 --> 1:28:07.181
GLORIA: It was a weekend
of horror for Sue Buttons.

1:28:07.248 --> 1:28:09.717
A weekend of chaos and loss.

1:28:09.784 --> 1:28:12.153
A weekend many of us
in her position

1:28:12.220 --> 1:28:13.955
would not have survived.

1:28:14.756 --> 1:28:17.125
But you did survive.

1:28:17.191 --> 1:28:20.461
And you had the courage
to share your story.

1:28:21.362 --> 1:28:24.232
A year ago, I lived through

1:28:24.298 --> 1:28:26.100
the worst three days
of my life.

1:28:26.167 --> 1:28:27.535
I lost my husband.

1:28:27.602 --> 1:28:30.171
I thought my life was over.

1:28:30.238 --> 1:28:31.839
But through my daily
affirmations,

1:28:31.906 --> 1:28:34.542
I was able to find
my inner strength to keep going.

1:28:34.609 --> 1:28:37.412
And I wanted to give
that power to others.

1:28:37.478 --> 1:28:39.013
So I wrote a book.

1:28:39.080 --> 1:28:41.983
A New York Times
best-selling book.

1:28:43.351 --> 1:28:45.019
Take Your Life Back.

1:28:45.086 --> 1:28:49.390
America, I'd like you
to meet my friend, Sue Buttons.

1:28:50.692 --> 1:28:54.395
Hello, America.
It's nice to meet you.

1:28:59.500 --> 1:29:01.936
(LIVELY INSTRUMENTAL
MUSIC PLAYING)

1:29:32.300 --> 1:29:33.668
Now, you have a quote

1:29:33.735 --> 1:29:36.003
on the cover of this book
that says,

1:29:36.070 --> 1:29:40.208
"If you make them see you,
they will finally look."

1:29:40.274 --> 1:29:41.943
Tell me about that.

1:29:42.009 --> 1:29:45.146
That's right.
That quote is so special to me.

1:29:45.213 --> 1:29:47.148
It came to me in a dream.

1:29:47.215 --> 1:29:51.018
Dreams are so important.

1:29:51.085 --> 1:29:52.720
I'm writing a book.

1:29:52.787 --> 1:29:54.922
I made that decision
right now.

1:29:54.989 --> 1:29:56.924
It's called Dreamscape.

1:29:56.991 --> 1:29:58.626
-(LAUGHS) I love it.
-It's like escaping.

1:29:58.693 --> 1:30:00.228
-Yes. That's lovely.
-Yeah.

1:30:00.294 --> 1:30:02.463
I'm gonna say this
right here and now.

1:30:02.530 --> 1:30:04.799
I think I have
another book in me.

1:30:04.866 --> 1:30:07.301
So perhaps we can
go on a book tour together.

1:30:07.368 --> 1:30:09.871
-Oh...
-I haven't thought of
my title yet.

1:30:09.937 --> 1:30:14.409
It might be
Continue Taking Your Life...

1:30:14.475 --> 1:30:15.743
Back?

1:30:15.810 --> 1:30:17.311
Oh, yes, of course. (CHUCKLES)

1:30:17.378 --> 1:30:18.613
Of course.Back.

1:30:18.679 --> 1:30:19.947
Take Your Life Back.

1:30:20.014 --> 1:30:21.449
Continue Taking Your Life Back.

1:30:21.516 --> 1:30:22.917
(WHISPERS) You're so brave.
