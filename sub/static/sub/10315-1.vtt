00:41.541 --> 00:45.294
My name is Steven Arthur Younger.

00:45.378 --> 00:47.379
l am an American citizen.

01:02.187 --> 01:07.232
My name is Steven Arthur Younger
and l am an American citizen.

01:07.317 --> 01:09.068

01:12.238 --> 01:15.324
l have... l have...

01:16.326 --> 01:18.577
l have certain demands.

01:34.010 --> 01:38.764
ln the name of Allah the merciful,
and his prophet Muhammad,

01:38.848 --> 01:41.934
peace be upon him.

01:42.018 --> 01:46.647
My name is Yusuf Atta Mohamed.

01:46.731 --> 01:50.234
My former name is Steven Arthur Younger.

02:46.708 --> 02:49.710
Trace has been on him for three weeks now,
turned up nothing.

02:49.794 --> 02:53.755
Goes to mosque, spends time
with his family, he meets friends for tea.

02:53.840 --> 02:57.384
Okay, l'll keep the surveillance guys on him
another week, then l'll pull.

02:57.468 --> 02:59.928
Sorry l'm late.
l was going over the phone logs.

03:00.013 --> 03:01.763
What else do we got? D.J.?

03:01.848 --> 03:03.015
Yeah.

03:03.099 --> 03:05.559
Threat Squad sent us a poison pen.

03:05.643 --> 03:09.146
Another flight school called
about an Arab-sounding man

03:09.272 --> 03:11.190
wanting to take flying lessons.

03:11.274 --> 03:13.692
Flight school?
My record's three in one week.

03:13.776 --> 03:15.027
Hang-gliding schools don't count.

03:15.111 --> 03:18.947
Okay, guys, but we got to check him out.
l'm sorry, but, get into it, please.

03:23.369 --> 03:26.079
Headquarters are doing their review
next week.

03:26.164 --> 03:27.539
We don't have much for show-and-tell.

03:27.624 --> 03:29.082
We're on top of things.

03:29.167 --> 03:30.834
Yeah.

03:30.919 --> 03:33.420
Helen, l think that l may have
something here.

03:33.504 --> 03:37.758
l went back over those new files from ClA
and l found this. Henry Humphries.

03:37.842 --> 03:39.551
Now there's actually nothing about him
in the file,

03:39.636 --> 03:42.721
it's all been redacted,
but his wife Rina is a Bosnian.

03:42.805 --> 03:43.889
-Bosnian?
-Yes.

03:43.973 --> 03:45.974
And from what l can tell
through all the redacting,

03:46.059 --> 03:49.436
she was involved in certain objectionable
activities during the war there.

03:49.520 --> 03:52.564
lt doesn't say what, but she's
a devout Muslim, she lives this side of town.

03:52.649 --> 03:55.984
So why doesn't she go to our mosque?
So, l called ClA and asked for open. . .

03:56.069 --> 03:57.402
Phil.

03:57.487 --> 03:58.904
A, we have no Bosnian connection,

03:58.988 --> 04:00.656
B, Muslim women
don't have to go to mosque,

04:00.740 --> 04:05.494
and C, if anyone is going to ask a favor
of another agency, it will be me.

04:06.162 --> 04:07.371
Oh, shoot.

04:08.748 --> 04:11.750
Right. Okay, l'm sorry.

04:11.834 --> 04:12.834
Phil?

04:16.422 --> 04:19.757
lt's good work. Why don't you look into it?

04:21.886 --> 04:23.053
Okay.

04:23.137 --> 04:24.721
Yes. Thank you.

04:26.808 --> 04:28.934
You were a first office agent once too,
you know.

04:29.018 --> 04:31.019
Yeah, l don't really remember.

04:32.313 --> 04:34.606
l'm gonna go inside,
fix you guys some lunch, okay?

04:34.691 --> 04:35.691
Okay.

04:42.198 --> 04:43.699
Who's that?

04:45.702 --> 04:47.452
Oh, it's the mailman.

04:49.205 --> 04:51.039
No. lt's the mailwoman today.

04:51.916 --> 04:53.208
She's cute. You want to see?

04:53.293 --> 04:55.711
You always check out the postal workers?

04:55.795 --> 04:57.129
Every day.

04:57.839 --> 04:59.798
...and we want to cooperate here on this.

04:59.882 --> 05:02.509
Now a dangerous fugitive
is apparently wanted

05:02.593 --> 05:05.762
in connection with a shooting
that took place earlier today.

05:06.681 --> 05:08.473
Yeah, l understand,

05:08.558 --> 05:09.850
but just because he's buying fertilizer,

05:09.934 --> 05:12.853
doesn't necessarily mean
he's making a bomb.

05:13.354 --> 05:16.940
l don't know, maybe he's planting
a garden full of roses for all l know.

05:17.025 --> 05:19.026
Do you recognize this man?

05:19.110 --> 05:23.822
His name is Steven Arthur Younger,
he's originally from Akron, Ohio.

05:23.906 --> 05:26.325
He is considered extremely dangerous
and should not be approached...

05:26.409 --> 05:27.826
You guys seen this?

05:27.910 --> 05:30.871
Aroused by the news girl, Vince?
Sexy voice, sexy blond hair.

05:31.831 --> 05:34.416
Aroused? Last time he got aroused
was 1 978.

05:34.500 --> 05:36.668
Yeah, with your mother.

05:38.546 --> 05:39.838
A nationwide...

05:39.922 --> 05:44.134
ln addition, authorities have given us
pictures of these locations.

05:44.218 --> 05:49.014
lf you can identify these places,
please call the 800 number on your...

05:49.682 --> 05:50.849
Federal authorities
are asking for your help...

05:50.933 --> 05:53.185
lt's on every channel. Who authorized this?

05:53.269 --> 05:56.063
Leo, call the Phoenix PD, will you?
Find out what's going on.

05:56.147 --> 06:00.025
That suspect has been identified
as Steven Arthur Younger,

06:00.109 --> 06:02.527
and he's wanted in connection
with the murder of a police officer...

06:02.612 --> 06:03.987
l recognize this guy.

06:05.990 --> 06:07.866
Phoenix PD
doesn't know anything about this.

06:07.950 --> 06:09.284
All their guys are accounted for.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.286
Who's covering this guy, Younger?

06:11.371 --> 06:13.288
-Oh, shit, he's one of mine.
-Get his file.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.832
Vince, get the Phoenix Field Office
on the line.

06:15.917 --> 06:17.876
Why does the TV have this before we do?

06:17.960 --> 06:21.880
All right. Steven Arthur Younger,
member of the King Fahad Mosque.

06:21.964 --> 06:24.841
No current address, no record,
no history of extremism.

06:24.926 --> 06:28.136
Says here that he served U.S. Army,
but his military file must be classified

06:28.221 --> 06:30.514
-because there's nothing in it.
-Why isn't that on the board?

06:30.598 --> 06:34.184
Hi, this is Special Agent Paul Vincent
from the FBl Los Angeles Field Office.

06:34.268 --> 06:35.310
l need everything you've got

06:35.395 --> 06:39.106
-on a Steven Arthur Younger, age 38.
-Helen?

06:40.233 --> 06:41.817
Have you seen these news reports?

06:41.901 --> 06:43.610
This guy, Younger,
you got anything on him?

06:43.694 --> 06:47.447
The suspect has been identified
as Steven Arthur Younger,

06:47.532 --> 06:50.742
and he's wanted in connection
with the murder of a police officer

06:50.827 --> 06:53.328
and the abduction of two young children.

06:56.165 --> 06:59.126
-We need to bring them all in.
-What?

06:59.210 --> 07:01.503
Can l talk to you in your office?

07:06.467 --> 07:10.053
We need to question their families,
their friends, their business associates,

07:10.138 --> 07:11.972
every single potential terrorist link

07:12.056 --> 07:13.890
you've been tracking
for the last nine months,

07:13.975 --> 07:16.017
and we have to do it right now.

07:16.102 --> 07:17.102
That's hundreds of people, Jack.

07:17.186 --> 07:18.270
We don't have the manpower to do that.

07:18.354 --> 07:20.480
We're getting them.
As many agents as we want.

07:20.565 --> 07:23.442
And we can enlist local law enforcement
if we need it.

07:23.526 --> 07:26.111
We need to find this guy and those places.

07:26.195 --> 07:28.447
Drop everything else. This is top priority.

07:28.531 --> 07:31.366
Okay. Can l know what this is about?

07:31.451 --> 07:32.909
lt's a classified directive from D.C.

07:32.994 --> 07:36.496
You'll be briefed soon enough,
but you better get on it.

07:39.959 --> 07:44.504
"So Papa Bear, Mama Bear and Baby Bear
all fell fast asleep."

07:46.549 --> 07:48.091
-You believe it's true?
-No.

07:48.968 --> 07:50.010
Yeah.

07:50.094 --> 07:51.636
-Think l'm making it up?
-Yeah.

07:51.721 --> 07:54.055
-No! You?
-No.

07:58.936 --> 08:01.396
Why don't you guys go to your room,

08:01.481 --> 08:06.234
find the bears, make sure they're all asleep,
okay? Go! Go ahead. Hurry. Run.

08:11.449 --> 08:12.449
Hello?

08:12.533 --> 08:14.993
Hi, l'm Agent Phillips,
Federal Bureau of lnvestigation.

08:15.077 --> 08:16.703
l'd like to come in and ask you
a few questions, please.

08:17.079 --> 08:18.788
-We found them !
-We got them !

08:18.873 --> 08:22.542
Good ! Good, sweetie pie.
Come, let's put them all to bed. Let's go!

08:26.881 --> 08:28.381
Hey, l was just about to call you.

08:28.466 --> 08:30.926
-Do l have a problem?
-With what? What's happened?

08:31.302 --> 08:34.596
Well, there's some guys outside my gate
claiming to be from the FBl.

08:34.679 --> 08:36.806
That's impossible.
Nobody knows where you are.

08:36.890 --> 08:37.974
You don't know anything about this?

08:38.058 --> 08:40.977
No. But l'm on it. l'll get straight back to you.

08:41.062 --> 08:44.606
No, l'll take care of it.
But you need to relocate us immediately.

08:44.690 --> 08:45.690
H, listen to me.

08:45.775 --> 08:47.484
This is my family.

08:47.568 --> 08:49.194
Goddamn it.

08:50.738 --> 08:53.198
We've got 80 suspects down there,
more on the way.

08:53.282 --> 08:54.950
These are a yes, these are a no.

08:55.034 --> 08:59.120
You make it damn clear that it may be
a military facility, but we have custody.

08:59.288 --> 09:01.581
Of course you read them their rights.
What kind of question is that?

09:01.666 --> 09:02.707
Can you hold, please?

09:02.792 --> 09:05.210
Just found out that Younger has an ex-wife
and two small children.

09:05.294 --> 09:07.128
They left the house five days ago,
haven't been seen since.

09:07.213 --> 09:10.882
Put a material witness warrant on her.
She's bound to know something. Find her.

09:13.469 --> 09:15.470
Hey, Mike, l'm gonna have to call you back.

09:16.973 --> 09:18.139
-Brody.
-Special Agent Brody,

09:18.224 --> 09:19.474
my name is Charles Thompson.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.726
I'm connected
with the Defense lntelligence Agency.

09:21.811 --> 09:24.563
l need to discuss with you
a matter of extreme national security.

09:24.647 --> 09:26.064
What do you mean, connected?

09:26.148 --> 09:28.942
-Listen to me.
-How did you get my personal number?

09:29.026 --> 09:30.735
You got a thousand new files today.

09:30.820 --> 09:33.280
l wouldn't know that or your number
if l wasn't for real, right?

09:33.364 --> 09:34.823
l'm not gonna discuss this with you.

09:34.907 --> 09:39.661
Listen to me, please.
A ClA file was sent earlier to you in error.

09:39.912 --> 09:44.040
Name of Henry Humphries. lt's a mistake.
He's an extremely dangerous man.

09:44.125 --> 09:45.709
-PIease hoId.
-No!

09:45.793 --> 09:49.296
-Who is that?
-l don't know. Nobody has this number.

09:49.380 --> 09:50.672
l have a lot of files here.

09:50.756 --> 09:52.632
l know you got the goddamn file!

09:52.717 --> 09:55.468
lf you sent people there,
withdraw them immediately.

09:55.553 --> 09:59.097
Do not approach him.
l repeat, you must not approach him.

09:59.181 --> 10:00.223
Can you hold?

10:01.350 --> 10:03.643
-Phillips and Huntley went there.
-Call them.

10:05.104 --> 10:07.606
"Personal information restricted.
This man is armed and dangerous.

10:07.690 --> 10:11.109
"No approach to be made to subject
or family under any circumstances.

10:11.193 --> 10:15.864
"Department heads, contact
Charles Thompson before any other action."

10:15.948 --> 10:17.449
-They're not answering.
-Oh, shit.

10:17.533 --> 10:19.409
Okay, l'm on it. D.J. , let's go!

10:31.380 --> 10:33.048
That's their car.

10:42.558 --> 10:45.226
-Camera.
-The door is open. Go.

10:52.777 --> 10:53.777
l'm in here.

10:53.861 --> 10:56.821
FBl ! Move to the door so l can see you !

10:57.406 --> 10:59.074
Show me your badge.

11:00.951 --> 11:02.452
-Right here.
-Let me see it!

11:03.621 --> 11:04.913
Right here!

11:06.374 --> 11:07.707
Coming out.

11:16.926 --> 11:18.593
You take one more step and l'll shoot.

11:18.678 --> 11:19.761
Oh, please.

11:22.473 --> 11:24.933
-Put the gun down.
-No way.

11:25.017 --> 11:26.726
Not you. Her.

11:26.811 --> 11:29.354
Put it on the mantel. Back away, slowly.

11:33.150 --> 11:35.110
Hands on your head !

11:35.194 --> 11:36.695
-Hands on your head !
-Lower your voice!

11:36.779 --> 11:38.571
Do not frighten my children.

11:39.782 --> 11:42.450
Who the fuck sent you idiots to my house?

11:54.964 --> 11:57.382
-l'm Special Agent Brody.
-Where are my children?

11:57.466 --> 11:58.925
With your wife. They're fine.

12:00.761 --> 12:02.095
You have a file on me?

12:02.179 --> 12:06.224
Henry Harold Humphries.
ls that your real name?

12:06.809 --> 12:09.310
-What do you think?
-You've been read your rights?

12:09.395 --> 12:11.604
-My guy's coming.
-No one knows you're here.

12:11.689 --> 12:14.691
Did you send these assholes to my house?
Are you responsible for that?

12:14.775 --> 12:16.401
Do you have a first name you can give me?

12:16.485 --> 12:17.485
A real one?

12:18.446 --> 12:20.572
Okay, okay, let's play the game.

12:21.323 --> 12:23.116
You can call me H.

12:23.200 --> 12:24.826
What's your first name, Agent Brody?

12:24.910 --> 12:27.078
You kidnapped and detained
two federal agents.

12:27.163 --> 12:28.872
-You admit to that, right?
-They came to my house.

12:28.956 --> 12:31.207
My children were there.
l could've killed them.

12:31.292 --> 12:33.835
So you think you're above the law, is that it?

12:37.757 --> 12:39.424
Do you recognize this man?

12:39.508 --> 12:41.718
Yeah. He's on TV, right?

12:43.220 --> 12:44.804
Helen, l'm sorry, this interview is terminated.

12:44.889 --> 12:46.306
l depend on you. Come on !

12:46.390 --> 12:50.268
lt's a screw-up.
Your name is on some list ClA sent the FBl.

12:50.352 --> 12:52.771
No one told me.
l can't believe you let this happen.

12:52.855 --> 12:54.773
You sent us his file. Don't blame FBl.

12:54.857 --> 12:57.692
Really? Did you check the leads
against the DlA priority list

12:57.777 --> 12:59.611
with the little red tags saying
"Do Not Touch"?

12:59.695 --> 13:00.862
Wait, he's under protection?

13:00.946 --> 13:02.739
This is my life.
How could you screw this up?

13:02.823 --> 13:05.909
He's a target. He thought your guys
were killers. Sorry about that.

13:05.993 --> 13:08.119
Thanks for your heartfelt fucking apology.

13:08.204 --> 13:09.204
Who are you?

13:09.288 --> 13:11.331
Probably best not to ask.

13:15.336 --> 13:17.003
Jack, what's going on?

13:17.087 --> 13:19.380
Can l talk to you for a second?

13:23.302 --> 13:25.470
l can't give you all the details right now,

13:25.554 --> 13:29.098
but we're being moved
to a centralized command facility.

13:30.476 --> 13:31.935
You gonna help me with this one, okay?

13:32.019 --> 13:33.269
Okay, of course.

13:34.480 --> 13:36.064
But where is this facility?

13:37.441 --> 13:39.734
lt's classified.

14:00.548 --> 14:03.091
What the hell is this place?

14:10.641 --> 14:13.476
- Agent Brody? All right, follow me, please.
-Yep?

14:27.157 --> 14:29.409
At this point,
l need to take all of your firearms.

14:29.493 --> 14:32.036
-You're not taking my gun.
-Ma'am, l'm sorry. The rules. . .

14:32.121 --> 14:35.039
-lt's okay, son, let her keep it.
-Yes, sir.

14:35.916 --> 14:39.002
l'm General Paulson,
l'm leading the operation here.

14:39.086 --> 14:40.503
-You're Brody?
-Yes.

14:40.588 --> 14:43.423
l know you haven't been briefed on this,
but you guys will be assisting us

14:43.507 --> 14:46.301
with investigative duties
under my command here.

14:46.385 --> 14:47.510
So l'll show you to your offices and. . .

14:47.595 --> 14:49.387
No disrespect, sir, but outside martial law,

14:49.471 --> 14:51.890
the military has no jurisdiction
on home soil.

14:51.974 --> 14:53.892
Well, there's the Defense Authorization Act.

14:53.976 --> 14:56.311
The President has the authority
to use the armed forces

14:56.395 --> 15:00.106
to suppress any insurrection,
unlawful combination or conspiracy.

15:01.191 --> 15:02.859
This all went through Congress in '07.

15:02.943 --> 15:05.320
Agent Helen ! Good to see you again.

15:05.404 --> 15:08.406
-General, nice to see you.
-Charlie. You all know each other?

15:08.490 --> 15:10.074
Yeah, we met earlier. A little mix-up.

15:10.159 --> 15:12.201
What are you doing here?
Who are you guys?

15:12.286 --> 15:14.412
-lndependent contractors?
-What agency?

15:14.496 --> 15:17.290
Oh, no agency would claim us.
Right, General?

15:17.374 --> 15:19.042
Okay, everyone.
lf you could follow me, please.

15:24.757 --> 15:25.965
Right in here, please.

15:29.178 --> 15:31.346
Where are the rest of my people?

15:31.430 --> 15:33.348
We're working with the staff we have here
from this room.

15:33.432 --> 15:37.101
Secure lines are being set up with all
field offices as well as other agencies.

15:37.186 --> 15:38.227
What is this place?

15:38.312 --> 15:41.189
Nowhere. lt doesn't exist. Neither do we.

15:42.149 --> 15:44.609
Hey, guys, l need you to see this.

15:48.656 --> 15:52.450
ln the name of Allah the merciful,
and his prophet Muhammad,

15:53.410 --> 15:54.494
peace be upon him.

15:55.454 --> 15:58.456
My name is Yusuf Atta Mohamed.

16:00.125 --> 16:03.711
My former name is Steven Arthur Younger.

16:05.631 --> 16:06.965
This is Location One.

16:07.049 --> 16:10.301
We took a screen capture
of all the locations, cleaned them up,

16:10.386 --> 16:13.388
took him out and then took that thing out.

16:13.472 --> 16:17.058
Some of you will recognize this.

16:19.019 --> 16:20.478
It is a bomb.

16:20.562 --> 16:22.230
You've seen this?

16:26.193 --> 16:31.447
l've placed three bombs
in three American cities.

16:32.992 --> 16:37.412
All three are identical,
all three are in urban areas,

16:38.747 --> 16:40.248
and aII three

16:43.919 --> 16:45.211
are nucIear bombs.

16:46.255 --> 16:47.213
Jesus.

16:47.297 --> 16:50.758
l have demands which will be met by you,

16:51.844 --> 16:53.970
or these bombs will explode.

16:56.974 --> 16:59.225
l will give you these demands

17:01.270 --> 17:02.645
at a Iater date.

17:05.523 --> 17:07.483
This is Location Two.

17:11.405 --> 17:13.321
This is Location Three.

17:18.537 --> 17:21.329
All three bombs are set to explode

17:22.165 --> 17:27.002
on Friday the 21 st, at noon Pacific Time.

17:27.087 --> 17:30.048
Jesus. That's only four days from now.

17:30.132 --> 17:35.428
The fissionabIe materiaI
is shielded effectively in lead and water...

17:35.512 --> 17:38.806
You can check the tech details later
if you want.

17:38.891 --> 17:43.269
People, if there's a one percent chance
the threat is serious,

17:43.353 --> 17:44.562
this is a 1 00%.

17:44.646 --> 17:47.565
How could an individual
manufacture nuclear weapons?

17:47.649 --> 17:51.861
He's one of us. A specialist.
Career military, Delta Force.

17:51.945 --> 17:55.031
Expert in explosives, bomb disposal,

17:55.157 --> 17:58.242
specialized in field nuclear weapons.

17:58.327 --> 18:02.246
Served in lraq to check out nukes.
He knows what he's doing.

18:02.331 --> 18:04.123
He's 1 00% American.

18:04.208 --> 18:07.418
When he was a teenager,
his father moved the family to lslamabad

18:07.503 --> 18:09.087
to work at the embassy there.

18:09.171 --> 18:11.130
He's fluent in Farsi and Arabic.

18:11.215 --> 18:14.759
Do we know if there's a way he could
get his hands on fissionable material?

18:14.843 --> 18:19.138
Three years ago, he was on a team
checking nuclear facilities in Russia.

18:19.223 --> 18:22.683
The Russians can't
account for 1 5 to 1 8 pounds.

18:22.768 --> 18:26.479
They can't be accurate.
Around five pounds on each bomb.

18:26.563 --> 18:29.690
That's six to ten million casualties, folks.

18:30.943 --> 18:34.112
But do we have any direct evidence
that this is real?

18:34.196 --> 18:38.574
Tehran paid him 20 million to get
nuclear materials out of Russia and into lran.

18:38.659 --> 18:40.952
Then they lost track of him and the money.

18:41.036 --> 18:42.120
How do you know that?

18:42.204 --> 18:43.579
They told us themselves.

18:43.664 --> 18:46.457
They didn't want us using Younger
as an excuse to bomb the crap out of them.

18:46.542 --> 18:48.167
What does he want? Why is he doing this?

18:48.252 --> 18:52.088
We don't know. So far,
he's made no demands, no further contact.

18:52.172 --> 18:55.258
So we have 72 hours to figure out
where he's hiding.

18:55.342 --> 18:58.594
The focus of your investigation isn't
going to be about Younger's whereabouts.

18:58.679 --> 19:02.932
lt's about the location of those three bombs.
That is your immediate priority.

19:03.016 --> 19:05.017
But surely, if we find him,
we'll find the bombs.

19:05.102 --> 19:07.436
Not necessarily, Agent Helen.

19:10.649 --> 19:13.442
You already have him, don't you, General?

19:14.403 --> 19:18.281
He was arrested 24 hours ago?
Why didn't you come out and tell us?

19:18.365 --> 19:21.284
You didn't have clearance.
lt's classified through military intelligence.

19:21.368 --> 19:23.828
"Military intelligence." The great oxymoron.

19:23.912 --> 19:24.954
How was he caught?

19:25.038 --> 19:27.999
A security officer saw him in a mall
in Phoenix.

19:28.083 --> 19:32.587
His picture is plastered all over the country
and he goes to a mall?

19:32.671 --> 19:36.257
People, this is Colonel Kerkmejian.
He'll escort you to view the prisoner.

19:36.341 --> 19:38.342
You're allowed to observe and that's it.

19:38.427 --> 19:41.429
General, when can we interrogate this man?

19:41.513 --> 19:44.098
At the moment, the military is in charge
of any interrogation.

19:44.183 --> 19:46.601
lf that changes, we'll let you know.

19:46.685 --> 19:48.477
Colonel, if you would.

19:48.562 --> 19:50.605
-This way, please.
-Please.

20:01.783 --> 20:06.537
We have experts from multiple agencies,
the military, nuke specialists, psychologists,

20:06.622 --> 20:09.123
analyzing every word and movement
he makes.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.833
Who authorized this?

20:10.918 --> 20:13.628
Everything here
is within operational parameters.

20:13.712 --> 20:14.712
We never strike him.

20:14.796 --> 20:19.550
Hot, cold, sleep deprivation, intense noise,
bright lights, threats of violence.

20:19.635 --> 20:21.385
He must be terrified.

20:21.470 --> 20:24.347
Where are the dogs? There should be dogs.

20:24.973 --> 20:27.475
lt's the amateur hour here, Charlie.
This is never gonna work.

20:27.559 --> 20:30.561
Yeah, well,
you're gonna have to make it work.

20:34.524 --> 20:36.734
You want to get in there and talk to him?

20:36.818 --> 20:39.654
Yes. But l don't need your help to do that.

20:39.821 --> 20:41.822
Believe me, you will.

20:53.001 --> 20:55.044
Tell me he's not here.

21:08.517 --> 21:09.517
What's he doing?

21:11.019 --> 21:13.104
Oh, shit, here we go.

21:18.026 --> 21:19.527
What the hell?

21:22.572 --> 21:26.033
No. No way, you fucking animal.
You keep away from him.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.745
-Hello.
-Back the fuck. . .

21:30.872 --> 21:31.914
Get in there now!

21:40.215 --> 21:43.092
l never laid a hand on the prisoner.

21:43.176 --> 21:45.886
Don't hurt him ! You'll need him later.

21:50.434 --> 21:51.434
l'm going in now, Colonel.

21:51.518 --> 21:53.728
What? No, you don't have authorization.

21:53.812 --> 21:55.479
Do you intend to obstruct the FBl?

21:55.564 --> 21:58.149
Where the hell is Paulson?
And get him out of here!

22:07.159 --> 22:08.284
Shit.

22:08.702 --> 22:12.747
Mr. Younger, l'm Special Agent Brody, FBl.

22:12.831 --> 22:14.915
Your situation here is illegal.

22:15.000 --> 22:18.252
And l'm going to get you out of here,
so you and l can sit down and talk.

22:18.337 --> 22:22.631
l think you'll find that this is entirely legal.
And necessary.

22:23.675 --> 22:25.009
Necessary?

22:25.093 --> 22:27.011
ln the War on Terror.

22:27.262 --> 22:30.097
The FBl woman, she's in the cell alone.

22:30.557 --> 22:34.435
Thank you. Could you please dry my arms?
They're really cold.

22:38.565 --> 22:41.359
You looked at my watch.
Would you like to know the time?

22:41.443 --> 22:43.444
1 0: 1 5 in the morning.

22:47.532 --> 22:49.533
Mr. Younger,

22:49.618 --> 22:51.869
l'd like to ask you a few questions.

22:51.953 --> 22:53.913
About your wife Jehan
and your two children.

22:55.040 --> 22:56.624
What do you want to know?

22:56.708 --> 22:59.919
You must have been very upset
when she left you.

23:00.796 --> 23:04.340
l'm not upset. l accept my fate.

23:05.717 --> 23:07.593
You should accept yours.

23:07.677 --> 23:10.221
-Why are you doing this, Mr. Younger?
-Yusuf. My name is Yusuf.

23:10.305 --> 23:11.972
All right, Yusuf.

23:13.308 --> 23:15.726
They're gonna ask me about this

23:15.811 --> 23:18.813
and l would really like to be
able to tell them something.

23:20.440 --> 23:24.193
l'm sorry, nice lady. lt's too soon.

23:27.906 --> 23:29.824
Get her out of here.

23:31.368 --> 23:33.327
Ma'am. Ma'am.

23:35.831 --> 23:39.834
And you, soldier,
get some goddamn results!

23:45.465 --> 23:47.550
That's what l'm asking you.

23:48.176 --> 23:49.552
Call me back.

23:50.262 --> 23:53.764
You saw what's going on in there?
lt's arguably illegal and ineffective.

23:53.849 --> 23:56.142
Any information he gives
is probably unreliable.

23:56.226 --> 23:57.685
lf we work with these people, our integrity. . .

23:57.769 --> 24:00.521
At the moment, they have official sanction.

24:00.605 --> 24:02.356
Jack, l can't believe that.

24:02.441 --> 24:06.235
What about the General Counsel memo on
coercive interrogations? There's no way. . .

24:06.319 --> 24:09.780
Look, the Director's Office has ordered us

24:09.865 --> 24:11.907
to assist the military wherever possible.

24:12.033 --> 24:16.787
For now, we observe
and run our investigation simultaneously.

24:16.872 --> 24:19.915
Just keep me informed, okay?

24:23.920 --> 24:26.464
We have the guy but we can't say so.
Why the hell not?

24:26.548 --> 24:28.466
Because officially, he doesn't exist.

24:28.550 --> 24:29.925
His face is all over the country!

24:30.010 --> 24:31.135
And we keep it there.

24:31.219 --> 24:35.306
Faces lead to places. Our absolute priority
is finding these locations.

24:35.390 --> 24:38.142
Someone must know where they are,
and it's likely to be friends or family.

24:38.226 --> 24:40.269
Why can't we interrogate this guy?

24:40.353 --> 24:42.313
We are currently negotiating that.

24:42.397 --> 24:44.690
-Negotiating?
-Guys.

24:44.774 --> 24:46.358
Please.

24:46.443 --> 24:50.237
-D.J. , anything new on the ex-wife?
-Yeah, l just talked to the guys at LAX.

24:51.406 --> 24:54.158
Two days ago, the wife and kids
tried to board a plane to Saudi Arabia,

24:54.242 --> 24:56.702
but were denied a visa at the last minute.

24:56.786 --> 24:58.412
They're likely still in the country.

24:58.497 --> 25:01.749
Phillips, l need you to coordinate a check
with rental agencies.

25:01.833 --> 25:04.668
He must have transported the bombs
cross-country in some kind of truck.

25:04.753 --> 25:05.753
He wouldn't have used his real name.

25:05.837 --> 25:08.672
Okay, l'll get local PDs out at port cities
and border towns.

25:08.757 --> 25:12.176
Vince, get on to Frank and his team.

25:12.260 --> 25:16.805
Organize a trace on his lnternet, phone,
credit cards, travel bookings.

25:16.890 --> 25:19.225
Get National Security Letters
for anyone who gives you a hard time.

25:19.309 --> 25:20.309
You got it.

25:21.436 --> 25:23.229
Helen. Can l have a word with you?

25:24.439 --> 25:26.815
We need you to negotiate. With H.

25:26.900 --> 25:28.567
He's asking for you.

25:37.911 --> 25:42.164
l hear you're a specialist interrogator.
Ex-Army?

25:42.249 --> 25:43.832
Made me the man l am today.

25:44.626 --> 25:47.336
ls that how you work with colleagues?
You beat them?

25:47.420 --> 25:50.923
He's a cheap sadist.
Younger knows all about those techniques.

25:51.007 --> 25:52.883
He was trained by the Army
to withstand them.

25:52.968 --> 25:54.343
That stuff's not gonna work on him.

25:54.427 --> 25:57.763
What are the chances they'll use you
after that little show?

25:57.847 --> 25:59.348
You thought that was a show?

26:00.267 --> 26:02.643
You wanted the other interrogators
to look like the bad guys.

26:02.727 --> 26:04.812
They are the bad guys.

26:05.981 --> 26:09.233
So, you talked to Younger.
Learn anything else about him?

26:09.317 --> 26:11.986
A little. You?

26:12.070 --> 26:13.988
Oh, no, that's his file there.

26:14.072 --> 26:16.282
This is yours.

26:18.451 --> 26:20.035
lt's classified.

26:20.120 --> 26:22.580
l see why they picked you, though.

26:22.831 --> 26:25.791
-Harvard Law, graduated with honors.
-Who gave that to you?

26:25.875 --> 26:28.961
Counter-terrorism. Good choice.
Let me see what else.

26:29.588 --> 26:31.297
No boyfriends.

26:31.381 --> 26:34.592
And no children.
Chose a career over a family.

26:34.676 --> 26:37.011
Better watch that,
they gonna think you're a lesbian.

26:39.889 --> 26:43.726
So, you didn't get anything
out of him yet, huh? What a surprise.

26:43.810 --> 26:46.520
Yeah, well, the General here
has a great deal for you.

26:46.605 --> 26:50.524
The price is right but you can't beat up
any more interrogators.

26:50.609 --> 26:51.609
l'm in charge.

26:51.693 --> 26:55.613
You'll be brought in as we deem necessary,
take turns interrogating with the others.

26:55.697 --> 26:59.241
l work alone with an assistant
and one other interrogator of my choice

26:59.326 --> 27:00.576
who takes over when l need a break.

27:00.660 --> 27:02.036
You don't call the shots here, l do.

27:02.120 --> 27:07.291
You want me to do my work,
you will treat me with respect.

27:08.043 --> 27:09.793
Especially in front of a lady.

27:09.878 --> 27:11.378
Look, we're all under a lot of pressure here.

27:11.463 --> 27:14.173
-Why don't we just back off. . .
-You're a grown man. Deal with it.

27:14.257 --> 27:16.508
Future of this country is in your hands.

27:16.593 --> 27:20.304
Lose the committee, l lead with one other.

27:21.264 --> 27:22.264
Who?

27:24.351 --> 27:25.392
Her.

27:25.935 --> 27:28.646
No way.
She's part of a side investigation here,

27:28.730 --> 27:30.898
she doesn't know the first thing
about military interrogation.

27:30.982 --> 27:33.651
-There's absolutely no. . .
-Give him what he wants.

27:33.735 --> 27:36.236
And get him in there now, General.

27:38.365 --> 27:39.657
Why do you want me?

27:39.741 --> 27:41.992
You've got integrity, l like that.

27:42.077 --> 27:46.455
And these people are dangerous.
l may need protection.

27:48.875 --> 27:50.918
Do you have a plan?

27:51.002 --> 27:54.421
l shake him up, you shake him down, okay?

28:03.431 --> 28:04.973
Outstanding !

28:05.266 --> 28:09.645
ClA Human Resources Training Manual,
circa 1 983.

28:09.729 --> 28:10.896
"The Honduran Edition," right?

28:10.980 --> 28:12.856
People, we have a new specialist joining us.

28:12.941 --> 28:16.318
From now on, there will be no observers.
Everyone out, please.

28:16.403 --> 28:20.114
Lubitchich, have you told him how small his
penis is? They really hate that.

28:20.281 --> 28:22.950
All military personnel will leave at once.

28:23.034 --> 28:25.536
The rest of you, consult with your agencies.

28:25.620 --> 28:26.620
What the hell is happening?

28:26.705 --> 28:28.914
l am. You're out.

28:32.001 --> 28:33.210
ls my equipment here yet?

28:33.294 --> 28:35.671
Yeah, it's right over there,
and Alvarez is here.

28:35.755 --> 28:38.298
Hello, my friend. Wheel it right in.

28:42.345 --> 28:46.140
Can one of you guys get me
that fire ax over there, please?

28:48.351 --> 28:49.643
Fire ax, over there.

28:53.857 --> 28:56.900
Charlie, could you call my wife?
Ask her to bring my food down here, please.

28:56.985 --> 29:00.863
-She can't come in here, it's top secret.
-l need my wife here.

29:00.947 --> 29:03.031
And he's very particular about his food.

29:04.826 --> 29:07.536
-Thanks.
-Colonel Kerkmejian, you're in command.

29:07.620 --> 29:09.413
Me, sir? Aren't you?

29:12.250 --> 29:13.250
l'm doing it now.

29:15.920 --> 29:17.337
Let's get him down.

29:19.466 --> 29:21.383
So, how does this work?

29:21.468 --> 29:22.926
l never know that.

29:23.011 --> 29:25.179
And the really great thing is

29:25.263 --> 29:26.805
he doesn't either.

29:37.358 --> 29:38.442
Agent Brody?

29:38.943 --> 29:40.360
We're gonna need your eyes.

29:40.820 --> 29:44.323
Could you look for any interesting tics,

29:44.407 --> 29:47.075
eye movements, fear, jitters,

29:47.160 --> 29:49.161
things like that, please?

29:50.205 --> 29:53.207
Mr. Younger! My name is H.

29:53.291 --> 29:56.293
l'm going to be conducting
your interrogation from here on out.

29:56.377 --> 29:57.628
We've met.

29:57.712 --> 30:00.756
That's right. Sorry you had to see that.

30:01.049 --> 30:05.177
And l want you to know,
my interest lies only with you.

30:05.470 --> 30:10.557
Now, l have one question for you.
lt's a simple one.

30:10.850 --> 30:15.145
PIease teII me
where you placed the three bombs.

30:15.730 --> 30:17.356
This is not what we talked about.

30:17.440 --> 30:19.858
That's because you were only listening
to yourself.

30:20.151 --> 30:23.320
Start with the furthest location, please.

30:32.080 --> 30:33.539
Mr. Younger?

30:36.000 --> 30:38.460
You understand
what l'm about to do to you?

30:43.633 --> 30:44.675
Oh, my God !

30:52.475 --> 30:54.101
What? What? lt's only a finger.

30:54.185 --> 30:57.145
What, not really a whole finger, it's. . .

30:57.772 --> 30:59.314
Tape him, then leave him.

30:59.399 --> 31:01.817
-Get him out!
-All right!

31:03.611 --> 31:07.406
So that's your technique?
You're a fucking joke.

31:08.116 --> 31:09.867
You expect me to be part of that?

31:09.951 --> 31:11.493
All right, all right, no more fingers.

31:11.578 --> 31:13.704
You think you're going back in there?

31:13.788 --> 31:15.455
Well, why don't we ask the man?

31:15.540 --> 31:19.960
He's got direct access, highest levels,
back door, no names, no records.

31:20.753 --> 31:24.464
Well, tell me. Do l have authorization or not?

31:24.549 --> 31:26.800
Higher authority believes
that we should all do

31:26.885 --> 31:31.054
what we think is best for our country
and its people.

31:33.641 --> 31:34.808
Alvarez, bag him.

31:35.935 --> 31:38.395
Colonel, would you lose the gorillas?

31:38.479 --> 31:40.564
-lf l'm in charge here, l. . .
-You're not.

31:40.648 --> 31:42.900
He is and we need to do something
about that.

31:43.860 --> 31:45.402
l won't authorize him to continue. . .

31:45.486 --> 31:49.156
So let it happen without your authorization.
Then you're covered, right?

31:52.994 --> 31:55.245
-One of my guys stays.
-Deal.

31:55.330 --> 31:58.415
We need to stop this at once.
That man needs to be pulled out right now!

31:58.499 --> 32:00.792
You want to leave, that's fine.

32:06.007 --> 32:08.842
Lay everything out on this table, please.

32:25.777 --> 32:28.737
l haven't seen you since Afghanistan, right?

32:32.283 --> 32:35.035
When you're done, you can wait outside.

32:50.343 --> 32:53.971
Mr. Younger, are you ready for this?

32:55.765 --> 32:56.765
No.

32:57.892 --> 32:59.601
No one ever is.

33:08.695 --> 33:11.279
All your worst fears,

33:11.364 --> 33:13.490
all your nightmares

33:13.574 --> 33:15.409
are right here.

33:22.500 --> 33:24.209
Oh, my God ! Oh, my God !

33:24.293 --> 33:25.419
Get General Paulson here right now!

33:25.503 --> 33:26.670
Colonel, the Geneva Convention
states that. . .

33:26.754 --> 33:29.631
The Military Commissions Act,
no unlawful enemy combatants

33:29.716 --> 33:30.966
may invoke the Geneva Convention.

33:31.050 --> 33:32.634
That act declares torture illegal.

33:32.719 --> 33:34.845
Unlawful combatants have no right
to habeas corpus.

33:34.929 --> 33:36.763
They can't bring any claims to court,
so how do they prove it?

33:36.848 --> 33:40.142
That's alien unlawful enemy combatants.
This man is an American citizen.

33:40.226 --> 33:43.270
That was revoked yesterday.
He's now stateless.

33:44.063 --> 33:45.188
You can't do that.

33:45.273 --> 33:48.316
Sir, General Paulson
can't come back right now.

33:48.401 --> 33:49.985
He says you're in charge, and carry on.

33:50.069 --> 33:51.361
-He says what?
-Carry on, sir.

33:51.446 --> 33:54.114
This is illegal.
l will not allow this to happen !

33:55.616 --> 34:00.162
The plutonium pit consists of

34:00.246 --> 34:02.998
three canisters of plutonium E,

34:04.584 --> 34:06.460
one and a half pounds.

34:08.420 --> 34:10.297
Another one and half pounds,

34:12.425 --> 34:15.052
and another one and a half pounds.

34:16.262 --> 34:18.054
We have to stop this.

34:19.056 --> 34:20.849
Let me call you back.

34:21.266 --> 34:23.518
Can you shut the door, please?

34:27.482 --> 34:28.899
What he's doing in there
is a violation of every. . .

34:28.983 --> 34:31.359
Did you interview the suspect again?

34:31.444 --> 34:32.985
-No.
-Then why have you left the room?

34:33.071 --> 34:36.989
Jack, the suspect is being tortured.
This is unconstitutional.

34:37.074 --> 34:42.329
Helen, if those bombs go off,
there will be no fucking Constitution !

34:53.382 --> 34:56.384
Main Justice and the Director's Office
are aware of what's going on here,

34:56.469 --> 35:01.014
but we are powerless to stop it
and the situation is too grave to pull out.

35:01.766 --> 35:04.684
When you're in there you act as a witness,
and when this is over,

35:04.769 --> 35:08.480
we'll bring a civil rights prosecution
against these bastards.

35:08.564 --> 35:11.483
ln the meantime,
you are lncident Commander.

35:12.401 --> 35:16.363
We need you to do everything in your power
to find those bombs.

35:17.657 --> 35:19.366
Do you understand?

35:37.885 --> 35:39.386
You've removed your name tag.

36:10.918 --> 36:12.711
Do you mind if l. . .

36:19.343 --> 36:20.677
You all right?

36:22.388 --> 36:26.600
You know, it hits everybody like that at first.
You get used to it.

36:29.770 --> 36:31.229
You didn't even question him.

36:32.106 --> 36:35.150
So this blood on my jacket would be all right
if l'd gotten some information?

36:35.234 --> 36:36.943
Well, you're not gonna get any.

36:37.028 --> 36:40.363
You do this and he'll say anything you want,
and none of it will be true.

36:40.448 --> 36:43.241
Physical torture doesn't work.

36:43.326 --> 36:46.703
So, l guess that's why they've been using it

36:46.787 --> 36:49.664
since the beginning of human history, huh?

36:49.749 --> 36:50.749
For fun?

36:50.833 --> 36:54.878
That's what makes you so special, is it?
Our secret weapon against the enemy?

36:56.130 --> 36:59.466
lt's not about the enemy. lt's about us.

36:59.634 --> 37:01.134
Our weakness.

37:03.137 --> 37:05.388
We're on the losing side, Helen.

37:07.516 --> 37:09.559
We're afraid, they're not.

37:10.645 --> 37:12.771
We doubt, they believe.

37:12.980 --> 37:14.105
We have values.

37:14.190 --> 37:17.025
And our values have cost us
how many lives?

37:17.526 --> 37:20.946
lt's not about that guy out there.
He's not the problem. You are.

37:21.030 --> 37:22.739
Whatever happened to rapport building?

37:22.823 --> 37:25.325
Takes time, possibly months.

37:25.409 --> 37:29.037
Look, this is a process.
He has to believe l have no limits.

37:29.121 --> 37:31.915
-You're not even asking him questions.
-That's your job.

37:31.999 --> 37:32.958
Well, then, let me do it.

37:33.042 --> 37:34.251
-You want to work with me?
-No!

37:34.335 --> 37:37.671
How about working beside me? Take turns?

37:50.059 --> 37:51.351
Go ahead.

38:14.792 --> 38:16.876
Yusuf, he's not gonna stop.

38:18.921 --> 38:23.341
Why are you letting him do this?

38:25.386 --> 38:27.971
We're gonna find these bombs anyway.

38:28.055 --> 38:32.058
You talk to me,
and maybe we can make it easy.

38:32.560 --> 38:35.395
Otherwise that bastard is gonna keep at you.

38:36.063 --> 38:37.480
lt's okay.

38:38.858 --> 38:40.525
l'm all prepared.

38:43.321 --> 38:47.532
Your friends at the mosque. Your family.

38:49.160 --> 38:50.910
Did you want to impress them with this?

38:52.371 --> 38:53.705
Your wife?

38:54.915 --> 38:56.291
Your kids?

38:59.879 --> 39:01.212
Oh, my God.

39:02.214 --> 39:03.548
Your kids.

39:04.091 --> 39:06.009
Nobody told you, did they?

39:06.093 --> 39:08.720
Your wife tried to leave the country,

39:08.971 --> 39:10.805
go to Saudi Arabia,

39:11.474 --> 39:13.224
but she was denied a visa.

39:13.309 --> 39:15.560
They could be hiding anywhere.

39:16.020 --> 39:18.605
You don't want them blown to pieces.

39:19.315 --> 39:21.941
Yusuf. Yusuf, you love them.

39:23.402 --> 39:25.653
You must love them so much.

39:28.824 --> 39:31.117
You have two days to agree to my demands.

39:32.286 --> 39:34.037
God damn it,
you haven't made any demands.

39:34.121 --> 39:37.332
Don't swear. God hears you.
He sees everything.

39:37.416 --> 39:38.792
He sees you.

39:39.251 --> 39:41.711
Allah loves those that do good, not evil.

39:43.047 --> 39:45.215
l read the Koran. l admire it.

39:45.299 --> 39:47.717
Allah blesses a just war.

39:47.802 --> 39:51.262
Give me one of the bombs.
Just one of the bombs. Just give me proof.

39:51.347 --> 39:53.014
Then they'll listen to you,
they'll know you're serious.

39:53.099 --> 39:54.432
Tomorrow.

39:55.142 --> 39:56.684
They'll listen tomorrow.

39:56.769 --> 39:58.353
What happens tomorrow?
The deadline is Friday.

39:58.437 --> 39:59.437
-Time's up.
-Wait!

39:59.522 --> 40:02.232
What happens tomorrow? Tell me, please!

40:02.316 --> 40:04.692
Help me to help you, okay?

40:04.777 --> 40:06.736
l don't need your help.

40:06.821 --> 40:09.572
l can take it. l deserve it.

40:09.657 --> 40:12.492
-You can stay if you want.
-What happens tomorrow?

40:12.660 --> 40:13.660
Hit him.

40:48.529 --> 40:50.989
Would you like me to kill you now?

40:52.241 --> 40:54.492
Do what you have to.

40:55.244 --> 40:57.203
l can't lose.

41:03.210 --> 41:05.336
You're practical.

41:05.421 --> 41:09.799
You're a relativist, a consequentialist.

41:09.884 --> 41:11.718
You know what l mean?

41:13.095 --> 41:15.472
Nah, of course you don't.

41:15.556 --> 41:18.516
You only read religious books.

41:21.437 --> 41:25.565
What l'm doing here is good for my people

41:26.066 --> 41:29.736
if l get results, if l save them.

41:30.654 --> 41:31.905
You see,

41:32.781 --> 41:36.743
there is no H and Younger.

41:36.827 --> 41:38.995
There's only victory and defeat.

41:39.079 --> 41:41.498
The winner gets to take
the moral high ground

41:41.582 --> 41:44.417
because they get to write the history books.

41:44.502 --> 41:47.504
The loser just loses.

41:50.216 --> 41:52.759
The only miscalculation in your plan

41:53.636 --> 41:54.969
was me.

41:56.597 --> 42:01.559
You see, l will tear your eyes out,
but you'll not tear my building down.

42:03.103 --> 42:07.524
Every man, no matter how strong he is,
lies to himself about something.

42:08.526 --> 42:11.069
l will find your lie

42:11.153 --> 42:12.487
and l will break you.

42:14.573 --> 42:16.324
You'll be a hero.

43:29.565 --> 43:30.648
Yes?

43:32.526 --> 43:33.693
Good.

43:34.653 --> 43:35.945
His wife is here.

43:36.030 --> 43:37.655
About time.

43:38.365 --> 43:39.949
H, Rina's here.

43:50.878 --> 43:52.128
Alvarez.

43:53.589 --> 43:56.341
Dim the lights, take an hour break.

43:59.136 --> 44:00.637
Okay, Colonel?

44:01.180 --> 44:03.723
Tell your wife nothing. You understand?

44:03.807 --> 44:06.392
-l'm going in.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey.

44:08.312 --> 44:09.937
Wait ten minutes.

44:10.022 --> 44:13.566
When the adrenaline wears off
he'll start to weep.

44:13.651 --> 44:16.819
Then you can talk to him. Not before.

44:17.071 --> 44:19.405
lf he's asleep, zap him.

44:19.990 --> 44:22.408
Just press this green button,
send a little shock through him

44:22.493 --> 44:24.327
and it'll wake him up, okay?

44:24.411 --> 44:26.621
But only you can press the button.

44:26.705 --> 44:28.081
You got that? Just her.

44:28.165 --> 44:29.499
l'm not gonna do it.

44:29.583 --> 44:31.501
Well, then you stay here.

44:31.585 --> 44:33.795
You can't run away from this.

44:34.713 --> 44:36.255
Run away?

44:36.924 --> 44:40.218
Some of us don't have that option, Helen.

44:40.302 --> 44:45.014
l got nowhere to run.
l'm a prisoner here myself.

44:45.099 --> 44:46.933
Ask the ClA.

44:48.435 --> 44:49.686
Ask them.

44:56.026 --> 44:58.194
What the hell is that about?

44:58.278 --> 45:01.364
He's done some bad things.
People out there are looking for him.

45:01.448 --> 45:03.032
They want payback.

45:03.117 --> 45:06.828
So he's done this many times before.
Does it ever work?

45:08.288 --> 45:10.248
You've become one of us.

45:10.332 --> 45:13.584
"That's terrible," we say, "but does it work?"

45:26.807 --> 45:29.642
You haven't been sleeping, you poor thing.

45:35.482 --> 45:36.816
-He's fallen asleep.
-What?

45:36.900 --> 45:39.152
-He's asleep.
-We need H back in here.

45:39.236 --> 45:41.738
Brody, push the damn button.
The bastard's not supposed to sleep!

45:41.822 --> 45:43.239
-You heard H.
-l'll do it.

45:43.323 --> 45:44.657
Don't, don't do it.

45:46.493 --> 45:48.244
That's enough. Turn it off.

45:48.328 --> 45:51.038
-Turn it off! For God's sake!
-l can't!

45:52.207 --> 45:54.167
My God, it's killing him !

45:56.086 --> 45:59.005
-Where is it? Where the fuck is it?
-Fuck!

46:13.896 --> 46:16.314
That's beautiful, Katie May.
Did you make that for me?

46:16.398 --> 46:18.149
I did it at schooI.

46:21.779 --> 46:23.196
You bastard.

46:23.363 --> 46:24.614
You mind?

46:24.698 --> 46:28.576
Kids, Daddy's got to go.
But l'll be home soon, okay?

46:28.994 --> 46:30.369
Bye-bye, Daddy.

46:30.454 --> 46:32.330
-l love you.
-Love you, too.

46:34.458 --> 46:36.626
Current ran for 1 5 seconds, he'll be fine.

46:36.710 --> 46:37.710
You nearly killed him.

46:37.795 --> 46:40.505
And you all tried to save him, right?

46:40.589 --> 46:42.882
l wanted him to see that.
He needs to feel hope.

46:42.966 --> 46:46.302
-You gonna find these fucking bombs?
-Nope, that's your job.

46:46.386 --> 46:49.263
Special Agent Brody, this is my wife, Rina.

46:52.476 --> 46:55.770
-Got to go, doll. Duty calls.
-Okay, love. Good-bye.

47:01.568 --> 47:03.653
You know. You know what he does.

47:03.737 --> 47:04.821
Of course.

47:04.905 --> 47:07.949
How can you? Your family, your children.

47:08.033 --> 47:11.410
You live in the same house with him.
He's not normal.

47:11.745 --> 47:12.912
Normal?

47:13.789 --> 47:15.998
Let me tell you something.

47:16.083 --> 47:19.210
l lost my first family in Bosnia.

47:19.294 --> 47:21.128
Three men come to my house.

47:21.964 --> 47:25.675
They rape me in front of my family,
then kill everyone.

47:25.759 --> 47:28.261
My little boy, they kill last.

47:29.429 --> 47:31.180
These were my neighbors,

47:31.265 --> 47:32.849
they knew me.

47:32.933 --> 47:34.934
Very normal men.

47:51.869 --> 47:55.413
We got him in Yemen, Pakistan, Russia,
all over. He used several passports.

47:55.497 --> 47:58.374
Okay, but did they put him and
the nuclear material together at any time?

47:58.458 --> 48:01.127
lt's only circumstantial. The Russians
don't know exactly how much. . .

48:01.211 --> 48:05.131
lf he did have 1 5, 1 8 pounds of it,
how did he transport it internationally?

48:05.215 --> 48:06.215
He had lots of money.

48:06.300 --> 48:08.801
Once it's properly sealed,
it's not that hard to move.

48:08.886 --> 48:10.386
Anything new on the ex-wife?

48:10.470 --> 48:13.055
Yeah, we tracked her to Oregon.
She used an ATM in Eugene.

48:13.140 --> 48:15.474
Local PD's hardcore on all motels
and B and Bs.

48:15.559 --> 48:16.726
We'll get her within the next 1 2 hours.

48:16.810 --> 48:19.270
Vince, Younger was arrested in a mall.
There must be a tape.

48:19.354 --> 48:22.565
The Military lntel has it. They're working out
whether we're allowed to see it.

48:22.649 --> 48:24.775
-Oh, Jesus.
-Boss, check it out.

48:24.860 --> 48:27.904
l got a Hertz employee in Jersey
who lD'd him. lt's a definite lD.

48:27.988 --> 48:29.947
He rented a two-ton truck,
he never returned it.

48:30.032 --> 48:31.490
Great. Trace its movements.

48:31.575 --> 48:34.160
Put a want on it to
all law enforcement agencies in major cities.

48:34.244 --> 48:36.287
Find someone who's seen that truck.

48:38.790 --> 48:41.918
Okay, he was arrested here.
That means he went cross-country.

48:42.002 --> 48:44.420
Three bombs. One East Coast.
Got to be Manhattan.

48:44.504 --> 48:48.090
One West Coast. Probably LA.
Jesus, we're right in the blast zone.

48:48.175 --> 48:51.761
Okay, third one, somewhere in the middle.
Maybe Chicago.

48:51.845 --> 48:52.803
Texas?

48:52.888 --> 48:55.640
-Okay, focus on these locations first.
-Doing it now.

48:55.724 --> 48:58.267
Hey, Brody, H wants you.

49:06.860 --> 49:08.361
Tell him l'm here.

49:08.820 --> 49:10.404
He can come out.

49:11.823 --> 49:14.033
H, she'd like you to come out.

49:16.328 --> 49:18.663
Helen, could you come in here?

49:20.207 --> 49:21.415
Please?

49:25.420 --> 49:26.837
Just here.

49:30.217 --> 49:31.384
Sorry.

49:32.970 --> 49:34.887
Yusuf, it's Thursday.

49:36.098 --> 49:38.265
What will happen today?

49:38.350 --> 49:40.101
Look at her, Yusuf.

49:44.314 --> 49:48.192
You know anything about massage?
lt would be very helpful.

49:49.361 --> 49:51.988
What? No, not for me, for him.

49:52.072 --> 49:56.617
His neck is in spasm and he needs a break.

49:56.702 --> 49:57.910
Please.

50:08.714 --> 50:10.756
Mind if l play some music?

50:20.017 --> 50:22.435
Like one of these? Keep you going.

50:25.772 --> 50:27.773
Just in case, for later.

50:30.235 --> 50:32.611
Go as deep as you can,
he's blocking the pain,

50:32.696 --> 50:34.405
l don't want him to lose sensation right. . .

50:34.489 --> 50:36.323
No, don't stop.

50:46.752 --> 50:49.420
Some subjects can take it from a male.

50:50.464 --> 50:51.714
Female?

50:52.716 --> 50:54.759
Breaks them right down.

50:55.510 --> 50:58.054
l had a nurse who used to assist me.

50:58.805 --> 51:01.182
She was very good.

51:01.266 --> 51:03.142
lt's why l married her.

51:03.894 --> 51:06.896
Did Rina tell you
what happened to her family?

51:07.647 --> 51:09.648
Yeah, of course she did.

51:10.734 --> 51:14.612
She tells complete strangers sometimes.
lt's embarrassing.

51:16.323 --> 51:18.657
Did she tell you the end of the story?

51:18.742 --> 51:21.494
What happened
when they took the village back

51:21.578 --> 51:23.704
and captured the three men?

51:24.498 --> 51:27.833
She killed their wives and kids
in front of them.

51:28.877 --> 51:31.962
And just as our troops arrived,
she killed those three men.

51:33.673 --> 51:36.759
They arrested her, handed her over to me.

51:40.347 --> 51:45.184
Did l tell you our children
were born prematurely, Helen?

51:46.394 --> 51:48.145
We were so worried.

51:48.855 --> 51:52.274
Childbirth was the most beautiful thing.

51:54.861 --> 51:59.281
When the tops of their heads start to crown,

51:59.366 --> 52:02.076
it's almost as if God actually exists.

52:05.705 --> 52:07.498
How about you, Yusuf?

52:08.542 --> 52:11.210
Where you there
when your wife gave birth to Ali?

52:12.879 --> 52:15.381
How about Samura?

52:15.465 --> 52:19.802
Agent Brody here would say yes
because she thinks you're a good father.

52:21.054 --> 52:25.683
Me? l don't think you were
anywhere near that hospital.

52:31.815 --> 52:33.107
Yes.

52:34.067 --> 52:36.610
Yes! That's what l want to see.

52:38.321 --> 52:40.656
No, don't! H, don't! Stop!

52:40.740 --> 52:41.782
Stop him, please!

52:41.867 --> 52:44.994
l can stop him, but you have to talk to me.
Tell me something !

52:45.078 --> 52:48.247
Okay! l'll talk, l'll talk! l'll talk! l'll. . .

52:59.384 --> 53:00.926
l am now willing

53:04.890 --> 53:07.558
to make a statement of my terms.

53:11.438 --> 53:13.522
This is a waste of time.

53:13.607 --> 53:16.859
Put him in front of a camera, he gets a break,
that's what he needs.

53:16.943 --> 53:19.737
Now make us an offer, we'll consider it.
More time.

53:19.821 --> 53:22.364
lf he talks at all, that's progress.

53:22.449 --> 53:23.866
And we don't make deals with terrorists.

53:23.950 --> 53:27.077
Oh, please, we do it all the time.

53:27.162 --> 53:29.330
He'll say he's been tortured, we'll deny it.

53:29.414 --> 53:31.582
He'll say he wants a broadcast,
we'll refuse it.

53:31.666 --> 53:35.461
He'll make crazy demands, and we'll reject it.
What's the goddamn point?

53:35.545 --> 53:36.879
Sir, we're recording.

53:39.424 --> 53:40.925
Mr. President,

53:43.637 --> 53:47.765
l am currently being held
on charges of terrorism.

53:52.312 --> 53:56.232
l am a Muslim and a loyal American.

53:57.984 --> 53:59.818
l love my wife.

54:05.158 --> 54:06.700
l love my kids.

54:08.745 --> 54:10.454
l love my country.

54:12.082 --> 54:16.418
Since my capture, l have been treated well

54:16.503 --> 54:21.006
by the honorable men and women
of our armed forces and police.

54:21.091 --> 54:22.258
He's stalling.

54:23.343 --> 54:26.637
l do not require you
to broadcast this statement.

54:26.721 --> 54:29.556
That would set a dangerous precedent.

54:30.433 --> 54:34.103
l've placed three bombs
in three American cities.

54:35.230 --> 54:37.982
I wiII reveaI their Iocations

54:38.066 --> 54:41.193
when you make
the following public announcements.

54:42.153 --> 54:43.946
First,

54:44.197 --> 54:48.993
no further financial or military support
will be given

54:49.077 --> 54:53.580
to puppet regimes and dictatorships
in any lslamic nations.

54:55.375 --> 54:56.583
Second,

54:57.377 --> 55:02.715
that all U.S. forces will be withdrawn
from all lslamic countries.

55:04.509 --> 55:08.971
l am willing to accept
a reasonabIe timeframe for these demands.

55:10.390 --> 55:13.559
Mr. President, l know you want to bring
our men and women home

55:13.643 --> 55:15.519
to the nation we love.

55:19.232 --> 55:21.191
Thank you

55:21.276 --> 55:23.777
and Allah bless America.

55:32.370 --> 55:33.996
Some kind of fucking joke.

55:34.080 --> 55:36.665
What if we persuade him that we're willing
to work toward his objectives?

55:36.750 --> 55:38.334
We could get the locations of the bombs.

55:38.418 --> 55:42.504
And allow a lone terrorist
to dictate U.S. foreign policy?

55:42.589 --> 55:46.091
He didn't ask for a broadcast.
He didn't ask us to show it to the public.

55:46.176 --> 55:47.343
He just wants to negotiate.

55:47.427 --> 55:49.511
Oh, negotiate. Are you out of your mind?

55:49.596 --> 55:53.182
lf we release this to the public, he knows
that we could never make a deal with him.

55:53.266 --> 55:56.727
-He just wants to negotiate.
-Just take the deal !

55:57.312 --> 55:59.521
His requests are reasonable, achievable,

55:59.606 --> 56:01.565
and l believe the American people
would go along with them.

56:01.649 --> 56:04.276
Which is why you can be damn sure
they won't ever get to hear them.

56:04.361 --> 56:06.779
Well, maybe they should.
What are you afraid of?

56:06.863 --> 56:09.948
He didn't ask us to do anything.
He just asked the President to announce it.

56:10.033 --> 56:11.617
Might save a few million people.

56:11.701 --> 56:14.286
We've got 21 hours left.
We're running out of time.

56:14.371 --> 56:16.205
lt's what he wants.

56:16.289 --> 56:19.625
And he's gathering his strength.
Bargaining for time.

56:19.709 --> 56:21.627
lf you don't cut this deal,

56:21.711 --> 56:24.254
l may have to crank this up a notch or two.

56:24.339 --> 56:28.634
To what? What's a notch or two
beyond what you're already doing?

56:29.803 --> 56:32.388
What are you getting by torturing him?

56:32.472 --> 56:35.599
He's given us nothing.
We've played right into his hands.

56:35.683 --> 56:37.726
Someone's gonna have to make a call here.

56:37.811 --> 56:39.770
The call is this,

56:39.854 --> 56:42.272
l'm not phoning upstairs
to tell the President he has to change

56:42.357 --> 56:46.819
a century's worth of Middle East policy
because some asshole made a video.

56:48.113 --> 56:50.823
You haven't even figured out
if the bombs are real !

56:51.199 --> 56:52.533
Okay then.

56:53.618 --> 56:55.494
Pending further developments,
we can assume

56:55.578 --> 56:58.080
that the current open protocols
of interrogation continue

56:58.164 --> 57:00.624
until otherwise directed by higher authority.

57:00.708 --> 57:04.628
So, in other words,
you want me to go on my way

57:04.712 --> 57:08.132
without telling me to go on my way?

57:17.892 --> 57:22.438
Yusuf, you could make a deal.
You've got these guys cold.

57:22.522 --> 57:25.941
They can't take you to court, they can't
prosecute a man with no fingernails.

57:26.025 --> 57:28.610
Give us your accomplices,
tell us where the bombs are,

57:28.695 --> 57:30.612
we put you on a flight to Pakistan.

57:30.697 --> 57:33.031
-With my kids?
-They'll negotiate.

57:33.116 --> 57:36.285
No one outside knows this ever happened.

57:36.369 --> 57:39.913
Give us the bombs and you could be free.

57:39.998 --> 57:42.040
He doesn't want to be free.

57:42.125 --> 57:43.625
Everyone wants to be free.

57:43.710 --> 57:47.087
An assumption the U.S. has screwed up
all over the world.

57:47.172 --> 57:50.799
What you call freedom is a false God.

57:50.884 --> 57:53.218
See? Like minds.

57:53.303 --> 57:55.220
Don't you get it, Brody?

57:55.305 --> 57:57.598
He placed himself here.

57:57.682 --> 57:59.808
He knew what we'd do to him.

58:00.268 --> 58:03.562
Yusuf, tell me where the bombs are.

58:03.646 --> 58:04.938
Make the deal.

58:05.023 --> 58:07.524
The bombs

58:07.609 --> 58:11.028
will explode if my terms are not met.

58:11.112 --> 58:13.322
But they will be.

58:13.406 --> 58:17.159
No other choice.
You have to tell them that, Brody.

58:19.913 --> 58:22.331
You really don't want to be here for this.

58:35.637 --> 58:37.429
How long does he stand there?

58:37.514 --> 58:38.764
23 minutes.

58:38.848 --> 58:41.141
Security told the cops,
they came in and got him.

58:41.226 --> 58:42.559
Speed it up, can you?

58:46.314 --> 58:47.606
Zoom in.

58:48.149 --> 58:51.527
He walks in, he stands
directly in front of a security camera,

58:51.611 --> 58:54.321
and he stays there for 23 minutes
until he gets caught?

58:54.405 --> 58:57.157
Same day he sent in the tape.
He wanted to get caught.

58:57.242 --> 59:01.453
He let himself get captured
even though he knew we could torture him.

59:01.788 --> 59:03.163
He was prepared for it.

59:03.248 --> 59:05.958
"l'm all prepared," that's what he said.

59:07.794 --> 59:08.794
Goddamn it!

59:08.878 --> 59:11.380
He's making monkeys out of us, people.

59:11.464 --> 59:15.759
He rented a truck.
That's loose circumstantial evidence at best.

59:15.843 --> 59:19.513
We have no direct evidence
that he even possesses nuclear material.

59:19.597 --> 59:21.473
Except a video with three bombs on it.

59:21.558 --> 59:23.559
And he knows how to make those bombs
look just right, doesn't he?

59:23.643 --> 59:27.771
He had the time, the means, the capability,
the finance, the contacts.

59:27.855 --> 59:29.231
There's the lranian connection.

59:29.315 --> 59:34.278
Some asshole waves a toy gun in the air
and forces the cops to shoot him.

59:34.362 --> 59:37.864
Suicide by police.
How about torture by government?

59:37.949 --> 59:40.492
You're saying he wanted to get captured
so we could torture him?

59:40.577 --> 59:41.577
Just to make a point.

59:41.661 --> 59:43.412
Well, what if it is a hoax?

59:43.496 --> 59:47.332
He could ask for anything
and we'd have no way of finding out.

59:47.834 --> 59:51.837
Brody, you better get back in there. Now.

01:00:03.516 --> 01:00:05.434
You can leave him.

01:00:05.518 --> 01:00:07.853
l've been ordered to take over.

01:00:09.188 --> 01:00:10.689
Okay, Alvarez.

01:00:20.199 --> 01:00:21.783
He's all yours.

01:00:32.670 --> 01:00:34.338
We know, Yusuf.

01:00:36.716 --> 01:00:38.717
We know about the bombs.

01:00:39.719 --> 01:00:42.387
You're very skillful.

01:00:43.014 --> 01:00:45.599
You can fake a nuke in a video, right?

01:00:47.226 --> 01:00:49.603
-The bombs are real.
-All right.

01:00:49.687 --> 01:00:52.147
Then give me one.

01:00:52.231 --> 01:00:54.066
Come on, prove it.

01:00:55.068 --> 01:00:56.693
Just give me one.

01:00:59.072 --> 01:01:01.323
You don't want me to give you proof.

01:01:01.407 --> 01:01:03.408
Nobody believes you, Yusuf.

01:01:04.118 --> 01:01:08.664
They're only doing this crap
because they want your accomplices.

01:01:08.748 --> 01:01:10.916
-What's she doing?
-But l don't even think they exist.

01:01:11.042 --> 01:01:12.000
You'll see.

01:01:12.085 --> 01:01:14.044
Don't ask me for proof.

01:01:14.128 --> 01:01:18.256
We need it in order to believe
the bombs are real.

01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:23.095
They'll give you what you want.

01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:26.264
You'll be such a hero.

01:01:31.479 --> 01:01:33.438
Your wife will come back,

01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:35.899
your children will love you.

01:01:38.695 --> 01:01:41.697
You let yourself be captured.

01:01:41.781 --> 01:01:45.158
You knew what they might do to you,
and they did it.

01:01:48.955 --> 01:01:51.748
Can't you see that you've already won?

01:01:51.833 --> 01:01:57.337
You've proved that we are exactly
the kind of people we say we aren't.

01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:00.799
Look what they did to you.

01:02:02.135 --> 01:02:04.469
You are the bravest man l know.

01:02:05.138 --> 01:02:06.805
But it's over now.

01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:08.682
There's no proof.

01:02:11.310 --> 01:02:13.395
There are no bombs, are there?

01:02:23.448 --> 01:02:25.782
No. No, there never were.

01:02:29.537 --> 01:02:31.663
There are no bombs.

01:02:32.915 --> 01:02:34.875
l just want my wife

01:02:35.376 --> 01:02:37.377
and my kids.

01:02:38.713 --> 01:02:41.423
Please, there are no bombs!

01:02:41.507 --> 01:02:45.469
Why did you let him keep on?
You could have told me at any time.

01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:49.347
l fucked up so bad.

01:02:50.224 --> 01:02:51.558
My wife,

01:02:52.727 --> 01:02:56.813
my religion, my country.

01:02:56.898 --> 01:02:58.064
l'm so sorry.

01:02:58.149 --> 01:03:00.650
Did you have nuclear material at any time?

01:03:00.735 --> 01:03:04.362
Nothing. The bombs are empty shells,
there's nothing in them.

01:03:04.447 --> 01:03:05.864
Where did you make the video?

01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:09.242
No, l don't want them to hear.

01:03:11.204 --> 01:03:13.246
Just whisper it in my ear.

01:03:18.753 --> 01:03:20.253
ls that right?

01:03:21.714 --> 01:03:27.344
Please don't let him hurt me anymore.
Please? Please, please.

01:03:42.235 --> 01:03:43.235
lt's a hoax.

01:03:44.278 --> 01:03:45.570
l knew it was a hoax.

01:03:45.655 --> 01:03:47.280
The man has been tortured.

01:03:47.365 --> 01:03:50.659
l was leading with my questioning.
He would say just about anything right now.

01:03:50.743 --> 01:03:52.619
She's right, you know.

01:03:53.579 --> 01:03:55.831
We always knew
it was only a one percent chance

01:03:55.915 --> 01:03:57.332
anyone could ever pull
something like this off.

01:03:57.416 --> 01:03:58.416
We've got an address.

01:03:58.501 --> 01:04:01.461
He said something
was going to happen today.

01:04:02.088 --> 01:04:03.588
We need to take that seriously.

01:04:25.403 --> 01:04:27.445
-Okay, go, now.
-Let's move.

01:04:27.613 --> 01:04:30.031
l'm Special Agent Brody.
This is Special Agent Vincent.

01:04:30.116 --> 01:04:31.741
-Major Pierce.
-What do you got?

01:04:31.826 --> 01:04:34.870
Not much. EOD is inside now,
checking for booby traps,

01:04:34.954 --> 01:04:37.539
doing environmental monitoring.
Looking for a source.

01:04:37.623 --> 01:04:38.957
Let's go.

01:04:42.128 --> 01:04:45.213
Helen, if this is a hoax,
then we're all off the hook.

01:04:45.298 --> 01:04:47.883
Something's not right, Vince.

01:04:47.967 --> 01:04:49.843
He planned all of this.

01:04:57.143 --> 01:04:58.977
Hand me the printout.

01:05:02.815 --> 01:05:04.149
This one.

01:05:06.652 --> 01:05:07.903
lt's the same, l'm sure.

01:05:07.987 --> 01:05:10.322
Has this area been cleared yet?

01:05:11.490 --> 01:05:12.991
Oh, shit.

01:05:13.868 --> 01:05:15.076
Pierce?

01:05:15.661 --> 01:05:20.498
We have a possible location, second floor,
southwestern corner.

01:05:21.667 --> 01:05:24.044
Send a team immediately, please.

01:05:24.128 --> 01:05:25.712
On our way, copy that.

01:05:26.172 --> 01:05:29.132
God, this whole area
could be booby trapped.

01:05:34.764 --> 01:05:36.765
Stay there! Don't move!

01:05:40.519 --> 01:05:42.479
Sir, we found something on the roof.

01:05:50.071 --> 01:05:51.237
Vince.

01:05:56.535 --> 01:05:58.620
He wants us up here.

01:05:58.704 --> 01:05:59.913
Why?

01:06:06.837 --> 01:06:07.837
What the hell is this?

01:06:07.922 --> 01:06:09.547
Don't touch that!

01:06:10.049 --> 01:06:11.049
Shit.

01:06:21.435 --> 01:06:24.854
Experts on the scene think that a bomb
probably made from C4 plastic explosives

01:06:24.939 --> 01:06:28.024
has been deliberately detonated
in a downtown shopping mall.

01:06:28.109 --> 01:06:30.151
They did not rule out terrorism.

01:06:30.236 --> 01:06:33.822
So far, we've seen several bodies come out.
They wouldn't give us a count.

01:06:33.906 --> 01:06:36.950
l got no idea
how many casualties we've got in there,

01:06:38.411 --> 01:06:40.912
but there are badly injured people.

01:06:42.456 --> 01:06:44.040
People are screaming for help.

01:06:44.125 --> 01:06:46.042
The whole building, it just blew up.

01:06:53.634 --> 01:06:55.176
You stupid son-of-a-bitch.

01:06:55.261 --> 01:06:59.264
Okay, okay! lmagine what
three goddamn nukes would do!

01:07:03.769 --> 01:07:05.603
How could you do this?

01:07:05.688 --> 01:07:06.855
How could you?

01:07:06.939 --> 01:07:08.565
You wanted proof,

01:07:09.608 --> 01:07:12.235
l needed a break. l can hold out now.

01:07:12.319 --> 01:07:16.531
lt was a shopping mall !
Fifty-three people are dead !

01:07:16.615 --> 01:07:20.452
That was your fault.
God loves them, they're martyrs, all martyrs.

01:07:20.536 --> 01:07:23.705
Fifty-three of them.
Fifty-three bodies blown to pieces!

01:07:23.789 --> 01:07:24.873
-Don't do it, Brody.
-Shut up!

01:07:24.957 --> 01:07:27.167
-Don't.
-Where are those bombs?

01:07:27.251 --> 01:07:28.877
Where are those fucking bombs?

01:07:28.961 --> 01:07:30.754
Do it! Do it!

01:07:30.838 --> 01:07:34.424
l love my country, you people crap on it!

01:07:34.508 --> 01:07:38.344
l love my religion and you people spit on it!

01:07:38.429 --> 01:07:42.557
Just remember something,
l'm here because l want to be here!

01:07:42.641 --> 01:07:46.561
l let myself be caught
because l'm not a coward.

01:07:46.645 --> 01:07:51.316
l chose to meet my oppressors face to face!

01:07:52.651 --> 01:07:55.653
You call me a barbarian.

01:07:56.322 --> 01:07:57.572
Then what are you?

01:07:57.656 --> 01:08:01.242
What, you expect me to weep
over 50 civilians?

01:08:01.327 --> 01:08:04.704
You people kill that number every day!

01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:09.793
How does it feel, Brody?
This is not about me. This is about you !

01:08:09.877 --> 01:08:14.589
How does it feel?
You have no authority here! None!

01:08:14.757 --> 01:08:18.760
There is but one authority and it is not you !

01:08:18.844 --> 01:08:20.345
You are a blight!

01:08:20.429 --> 01:08:22.930
You are a cancer!

01:08:23.015 --> 01:08:24.974
How does it feel, Brody?

01:08:36.444 --> 01:08:38.363
What's going on, Helen?

01:08:39.907 --> 01:08:42.533
Do you want me to take that?

01:09:02.345 --> 01:09:05.055
Boss, Younger got a parking ticket in Dallas.

01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:08.143
They traced the address
to a derelict warehouse. They found a bomb.

01:09:08.227 --> 01:09:09.477
They think it's real. lt's nuclear.

01:09:09.562 --> 01:09:12.897
lt may contain four, four and a half pounds,
set to detonate Friday at noon.

01:09:12.982 --> 01:09:14.524
lt was well hidden, perfectly shielded.

01:09:14.608 --> 01:09:16.734
We got real lucky,
but there's less than three hours left.

01:09:16.819 --> 01:09:18.236
Airborne detection came up empty.

01:09:18.319 --> 01:09:19.904
There's almost no chance
to find the other two in time.

01:09:19.988 --> 01:09:24.701
Brody? l need you to come in,
he's in a state.

01:09:24.785 --> 01:09:26.452
Of course he's in a state.
He's being tortured to death.

01:09:26.537 --> 01:09:28.787
Not Younger, H. He wants you.

01:09:49.268 --> 01:09:50.727
He might not crack.

01:09:52.270 --> 01:09:53.313
What are you saying?

01:09:55.024 --> 01:09:56.441
He might not crack.

01:09:56.525 --> 01:09:57.984
There's only three hours left.

01:10:01.822 --> 01:10:04.782
Look, ten million people are about to die.

01:10:04.867 --> 01:10:06.868
Are you still in, or not?

01:10:20.841 --> 01:10:23.801
lf you tell me to stop, l will.

01:10:24.970 --> 01:10:26.304
l'll stop.

01:11:09.515 --> 01:11:10.515
Yes.

01:11:12.017 --> 01:11:14.936
Brody, they got Jehan Younger.

01:11:18.774 --> 01:11:22.068
Where are my children?
l want to see them right now.

01:11:22.152 --> 01:11:23.778
They're in protective custody.
Please calm down.

01:11:23.862 --> 01:11:27.615
Don't tell me to calm down.
l want my children !

01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:29.826
Mrs. Younger, please take a seat
and we'll talk about this.

01:11:29.910 --> 01:11:33.204
l am not saying a word to you
until you let me see my kids!

01:11:33.289 --> 01:11:35.873
Mrs. Younger,
you are in very serious trouble.

01:11:35.958 --> 01:11:39.544
You'll be charged with supporting terrorism
if you do not cooperate with us immediately.

01:11:39.628 --> 01:11:41.087
That is a life sentence.

01:11:41.171 --> 01:11:44.465
Your children will be put in foster care
and you will never see them again.

01:11:44.550 --> 01:11:48.136
Now, sit the fuck down
and start telling us what you know.

01:11:48.220 --> 01:11:50.138
Brody, come out here, please.

01:11:59.606 --> 01:12:01.316
-l'm taking her in there with him.
-What?

01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:04.485
The wife is our ace in the hole.
You can talk to him now, get some answers.

01:12:04.570 --> 01:12:05.653
But we haven't interrogated her.

01:12:05.738 --> 01:12:06.863
She could tell us where the bombs are.

01:12:06.947 --> 01:12:10.658
We don't have time. We have to take her
in there, question her and him.

01:12:10.743 --> 01:12:14.037
But we have to do it right
and we got to do it now.

01:12:21.795 --> 01:12:23.880
What are you doing to me?

01:12:25.257 --> 01:12:26.924
What kind of animals are you?

01:12:27.009 --> 01:12:29.135
You saw the tape. We didn't make it, he did.

01:12:29.219 --> 01:12:30.803
He's a liar, he would never do that.

01:12:30.888 --> 01:12:32.847
lt's real and we think you're in on it.

01:12:32.931 --> 01:12:34.474
Do you ever want to
see your children again?

01:12:34.558 --> 01:12:36.017
l never knew anything about this.

01:12:36.101 --> 01:12:39.145
We don't believe you, Jehan.
Tell us something.

01:12:51.617 --> 01:12:53.326
Jehan.

01:12:53.410 --> 01:12:55.411
What have you done to him?

01:12:57.873 --> 01:12:59.415
You pigs.

01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:03.211
Now, Jehan, for your sake and ours,

01:13:03.295 --> 01:13:06.631
l want you to ask him where the bombs are.

01:13:07.174 --> 01:13:11.719
Say, "Yusuf, please tell me
where the bombs are, darling?"

01:13:13.639 --> 01:13:15.473
-Say it!
-Yusuf,

01:13:16.725 --> 01:13:19.102
where are the bombs?

01:13:19.186 --> 01:13:21.729
l think she still loves you, Yusuf.

01:13:21.814 --> 01:13:24.190
She wants to save you.

01:13:24.274 --> 01:13:26.901
Tell him. Tell him you love him.

01:13:30.906 --> 01:13:32.782
l love you, Yusuf.

01:13:34.785 --> 01:13:37.328
This is what you wanted, Yusuf.

01:13:37.413 --> 01:13:39.914
What you wanted !

01:13:42.334 --> 01:13:46.671
So, now l'm gonna cut some little pieces off
Jehan and give them to you.

01:13:46.755 --> 01:13:48.464
-Oh, no.
-No.

01:13:48.549 --> 01:13:50.091
-What the hell are you doing?
-Alvarez, hold the chair.

01:13:50.175 --> 01:13:52.009
-No, please.
-H, you can't do this!

01:13:52.094 --> 01:13:54.887
Please, stop him ! Please!
l'm an American citizen !

01:13:54.972 --> 01:13:56.597
-H.
-Shut up, Charlie.

01:13:56.682 --> 01:13:59.559
We're not gonna let you do this.
lt's not just me now.

01:13:59.643 --> 01:14:02.353
Oh, so now you're all working against me?

01:14:02.438 --> 01:14:07.108
Do you want to know where the bombs are
or not? lt's my responsibility!

01:14:07.192 --> 01:14:08.818
You want me to win,
or you want him to win?

01:14:08.902 --> 01:14:10.319
H, put the knife down.

01:14:10.404 --> 01:14:12.989
So you made a choice, you want him to win?

01:14:13.073 --> 01:14:14.949
You're all so fucking selfish.

01:14:15.033 --> 01:14:17.618
This is not about you !

01:14:17.703 --> 01:14:20.663
This is war. This is sacrifice.

01:14:22.499 --> 01:14:23.833
Take her back.

01:14:26.962 --> 01:14:28.379
No!

01:14:31.425 --> 01:14:33.301
-There's no time!
-No! Jehan !

01:14:33.385 --> 01:14:34.510
There's no time!

01:14:34.595 --> 01:14:36.137
No!

01:14:36.221 --> 01:14:38.473
There's no time!

01:15:04.082 --> 01:15:05.082
H.

01:15:12.257 --> 01:15:14.133
Government officials in each city

01:15:14.218 --> 01:15:20.515
are currently being evacuated
to nuclear shelters.

01:15:23.268 --> 01:15:25.728
Our own families have already gone.

01:15:28.607 --> 01:15:31.567
Bound to be some rumors, panic.

01:15:36.156 --> 01:15:38.282
We need you to finish this.

01:16:24.663 --> 01:16:27.707
You're gonna die here today.

01:16:27.791 --> 01:16:29.625
You know that, right?

01:16:31.628 --> 01:16:33.671
We both know it.

01:16:35.173 --> 01:16:37.258
They won't stop me now.

01:16:38.343 --> 01:16:40.011
There's no limits.

01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:13.210
What are you doing?

01:17:14.588 --> 01:17:16.130
He needs a little break.

01:17:16.214 --> 01:17:18.716
For God's sake, we have no time.

01:17:19.676 --> 01:17:21.636
Well, what do you think l should do, Helen?

01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:24.013
You son-of-a-bitch.
What do you want me to say?

01:17:25.015 --> 01:17:26.599
Just do what you have to do!

01:17:30.479 --> 01:17:33.606
What l have to do, Agent Brody, is

01:17:37.569 --> 01:17:39.070
unthinkable.

01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:46.619
Bring me the children.

01:17:46.703 --> 01:17:48.162
Jesus.

01:17:48.246 --> 01:17:52.583
Give me the children, l'll give you
the answers you want. Just bring them in.

01:17:52.668 --> 01:17:54.460
l'm not doing that.

01:17:54.544 --> 01:17:57.171
Just let him see them.
Let him see them with me.

01:17:57.255 --> 01:17:58.255
No.

01:17:59.007 --> 01:18:00.091
Over my dead body.

01:18:00.175 --> 01:18:01.801
-Kids are right outside.
-No!

01:18:01.885 --> 01:18:04.345
-You just don't get it, do you?
-You're not gonna hurt those children.

01:18:04.429 --> 01:18:05.429
-Do you think l would?
-Yes!

01:18:05.514 --> 01:18:06.889
Good ! Then so will he.

01:18:06.973 --> 01:18:10.351
lt's all been leading up to this.
He has to believe H will do anything.

01:18:10.435 --> 01:18:13.062
Look, all you have to do is bring them in,

01:18:13.146 --> 01:18:15.648
take them in the room and strap them down.
That's it.

01:18:15.732 --> 01:18:19.360
-No.
-l won't harm them. l give you my word.

01:18:19.444 --> 01:18:20.861
But he has to believe l will.

01:18:20.946 --> 01:18:24.865
Then he will tell us anything we want,
all right?

01:18:25.242 --> 01:18:27.284
All right, l'll do it.

01:18:27.619 --> 01:18:29.954
lf you hurt those children, l will kill you.

01:18:30.038 --> 01:18:31.539
Fine, Agent Brody.

01:18:31.623 --> 01:18:34.125
That's if we don't all die
from an explosion first.

01:18:34.918 --> 01:18:36.252
Jesus, fuck it.

01:19:02.446 --> 01:19:04.196
Come on, this way.

01:19:11.329 --> 01:19:12.705
You ready, Yusuf?

01:19:12.789 --> 01:19:14.915
Gonna keep you safe.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.251
This is the end.

01:19:17.335 --> 01:19:21.088
Nothing l do to you could make you talk.

01:19:21.173 --> 01:19:22.173
Not now.

01:19:34.853 --> 01:19:36.729
Look at your children.

01:19:37.439 --> 01:19:39.440
Aren't you proud of them?

01:19:44.029 --> 01:19:45.196
Don't.

01:19:46.031 --> 01:19:47.948
Don't let him do it, don't let him, l beg you.

01:19:48.033 --> 01:19:50.367
Yusuf. Yusuf, talk to us.

01:19:51.870 --> 01:19:54.538
You leave my fucking babies alone.

01:19:54.623 --> 01:19:56.040
Talk to us, Yusuf.

01:19:59.461 --> 01:20:00.461
No!

01:20:04.883 --> 01:20:08.385
Fuck! You fuck! You fuck!

01:20:11.181 --> 01:20:12.473
New York! There's a bomb in New York!

01:20:12.557 --> 01:20:14.058
Where in New York? Give me an address.

01:20:14.142 --> 01:20:15.476
Fuck you ! Stop him !

01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:18.896
-Get him away from my fucking babies!
-Give me an address!

01:20:18.980 --> 01:20:21.106
701 West 83rd, second floor!

01:20:21.191 --> 01:20:22.399
-Stop him !
-Second one?

01:20:22.484 --> 01:20:24.860
-Fucking stop him now!
-Give me the second one!

01:20:24.945 --> 01:20:29.782
Los Angeles, 1 8750 Centinela,
garage underneath it! Fucking stop him !

01:20:29.866 --> 01:20:31.575
Give me the third one!
We don't fucking believe you, Yusuf!

01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:35.496
Fuck! Please! l beg you, please stop him !

01:20:35.747 --> 01:20:37.289
Give me the third one, Yusuf.

01:20:37.374 --> 01:20:40.835
Dallas. Basement, 1 533 Smith.
Don't let him hurt them, please!

01:20:40.919 --> 01:20:41.919
Dallas, basement.

01:20:42.003 --> 01:20:43.128
Please, please don't let him
hurt them. Please.

01:20:44.589 --> 01:20:46.590
H, he told us. He told us where they are.

01:20:47.425 --> 01:20:49.343
-He's lying.
-No, he's not!

01:20:49.427 --> 01:20:51.971
The bomb we already found in Dallas.
He gave the right address.

01:20:52.055 --> 01:20:53.764
How long before you verify the others?

01:20:54.266 --> 01:20:56.642
-Twenty.
-Twenty minutes.

01:20:56.726 --> 01:20:58.310
Well, l have 20 minutes with them then.

01:20:59.020 --> 01:21:01.605
"We will assume that the current methods
of interrogation will continue

01:21:01.731 --> 01:21:03.983
"unless otherwise directed
by a higher authority."

01:21:04.276 --> 01:21:06.527
He sounds serious. He can't be serious?

01:21:06.611 --> 01:21:08.779
H, this operation is terminated !

01:21:08.864 --> 01:21:11.740
None of you respect my work, do you?

01:21:11.825 --> 01:21:16.954
None of you understand!
We don't stop until this all checks out!

01:21:17.497 --> 01:21:18.873
-Shit.
-That's the ruIe!

01:21:18.957 --> 01:21:21.709
lt's my duty to continue!

01:21:21.793 --> 01:21:22.960
H?

01:21:23.044 --> 01:21:25.212
They're children, innocent children !

01:21:25.297 --> 01:21:29.508
There are no innocent children !
Not his children anyway.

01:21:29.885 --> 01:21:34.680
Too selfish and weak
to carry out his own plan? No.

01:21:34.764 --> 01:21:38.893
No, l don't think so. l don't believe it!
Not from him.

01:21:38.977 --> 01:21:41.145
No! Stop him ! Please!

01:21:41.229 --> 01:21:43.647
Yusuf! There's more, isn't there?

01:21:43.732 --> 01:21:44.857
No, no, no!

01:21:44.941 --> 01:21:46.817
Do you believe l can do this?

01:21:46.902 --> 01:21:49.069
H, he believes it! He believes it!

01:21:49.154 --> 01:21:51.405
Faith is not enough, he has to know it.

01:21:51.489 --> 01:21:52.489
He knows it!

01:21:52.574 --> 01:21:55.826
Knowing it is not enough, he has to see it.

01:21:55.911 --> 01:21:57.578
No! Get him out of there!

01:21:57.662 --> 01:22:01.999
All right, that's enough ! Winston,
get over here and blow that goddamn door!

01:22:02.083 --> 01:22:03.083
Clear the door!

01:22:05.503 --> 01:22:06.962
Check, check!

01:22:07.047 --> 01:22:08.756
Goddamn it! Take it out!

01:22:10.216 --> 01:22:11.383
Check!

01:22:12.344 --> 01:22:13.385
Move it!

01:22:13.470 --> 01:22:15.346
H ! Stand down ! Stand down !

01:22:20.727 --> 01:22:22.811
All right, that's enough. That's enough !

01:22:24.814 --> 01:22:28.776
-Get the medic!
-No! Get them out of here!

01:22:28.860 --> 01:22:31.612
No one else sees them, you understand me?
Nobody sees them !

01:22:31.696 --> 01:22:33.948
What's the matter with you?

01:22:34.032 --> 01:22:36.033
Get up! Get up!

01:22:41.873 --> 01:22:43.040
You knew.

01:22:43.124 --> 01:22:44.124
You knew he could do this.

01:22:44.209 --> 01:22:47.252
-You had those kids lined up for him !
-l didn't know he'd go crazy!

01:22:56.763 --> 01:22:59.974
That man over there killed 53 people.

01:23:00.058 --> 01:23:03.435
Some of them women and children,
and yet somehow l'm the villain?

01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:06.480
You keep your mouth shut, you maniac.
You're fucking evil !

01:23:06.564 --> 01:23:07.690
Oh, and he's not?

01:23:13.071 --> 01:23:15.155
You hear that, Yusuf?

01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:16.907
You win.

01:23:16.992 --> 01:23:20.077
You got them all on your side now.

01:23:20.161 --> 01:23:21.745
You're in the clear.

01:23:23.957 --> 01:23:26.542
You don't even have to tell them
about the fourth bomb.

01:23:30.422 --> 01:23:32.423
What do you mean?

01:23:32.507 --> 01:23:33.966
Don't you know him by now?

01:23:34.050 --> 01:23:36.677
He's planned this every step of the way.

01:23:36.761 --> 01:23:38.804
l mean, what if he couldn't hold out?

01:23:38.888 --> 01:23:41.056
All he's got to do
is give us the three bombs, right?

01:23:41.683 --> 01:23:48.397
Now l remember 1 5 to 1 8 pounds
of nuclear material missing.

01:23:50.608 --> 01:23:51.984
Can't you fucking count?

01:23:53.194 --> 01:23:58.907
Four and a half times three is 1 3 and a half,
times four is 1 8.

01:24:00.618 --> 01:24:02.411
Give you three guesses what he did.

01:24:03.079 --> 01:24:04.913
-Ask him.
-You think there's another bomb?

01:24:04.998 --> 01:24:08.250
Course there's another bomb.
There's always another bomb.

01:24:08.334 --> 01:24:11.754
He didn't tell you about the mall bomb.
But he gave you the other three.

01:24:12.964 --> 01:24:15.799
Yes, Agent Brody, there's a fourth bomb.

01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:19.011
Oh, Christ! Get those kids back in here.

01:24:19.095 --> 01:24:22.890
lf anyone tries to stop you, shoot him.
That is a direct order!

01:24:22.974 --> 01:24:24.391
No. No bomb.

01:24:24.476 --> 01:24:25.809
We can't do this.

01:24:25.894 --> 01:24:29.229
-Brody, if there's a one percent chance. . .
-He's a maniac,

01:24:29.314 --> 01:24:32.316
you just said so! We have no evidence.

01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:34.276
But if we did it would be all right. Right?

01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:36.320
You'll get the children back.

01:24:36.446 --> 01:24:38.030
Really?
And what shall l do with them this time?

01:24:38.114 --> 01:24:40.157
-How far can l go?
-Just do the job, H.

01:24:43.495 --> 01:24:44.703
l have a condition.

01:24:45.538 --> 01:24:47.498
You. You go out there

01:24:47.582 --> 01:24:51.085
and drag those kids back in here kicking,
screaming and begging.

01:24:51.169 --> 01:24:53.587
You take them in there
and strap them down,

01:24:53.671 --> 01:24:56.673
'cause you're the only person here
with any decency.

01:24:56.758 --> 01:25:01.095
Fuck Alvarez, fuck Charlie.
Fuck all the rest of these fucks.

01:25:01.179 --> 01:25:03.305
-You do it.
-Why me?

01:25:03.807 --> 01:25:06.600
'Cause if you can do it, then anybody can.

01:25:08.061 --> 01:25:10.062
H, there is no time for games.

01:25:10.146 --> 01:25:11.772
l'm not playing games.

01:25:12.774 --> 01:25:14.274
l need your help.

01:25:15.276 --> 01:25:17.694
Tell me l can do this.

01:25:17.779 --> 01:25:21.115
Brody, this is his two kids
against thousands of ours.

01:25:21.199 --> 01:25:23.450
Justify me,

01:25:23.535 --> 01:25:24.785
tell me it's okay.

01:25:24.869 --> 01:25:26.703
-lf there's another bomb out there. . .
-You can't do this!

01:25:26.788 --> 01:25:28.747
We're fucking human beings.

01:25:28.832 --> 01:25:32.042
Let the bomb go off! We cannot do this!

01:25:41.845 --> 01:25:43.095
That's it.

01:25:50.728 --> 01:25:52.104
You're a free man, Yusuf.

01:25:52.689 --> 01:25:55.274
They can't prosecute
a man with no fingernails.

01:25:55.358 --> 01:25:56.525
What the hell are you doing?

01:25:56.609 --> 01:25:58.944
This is it. l'm letting him go.

01:26:00.029 --> 01:26:01.655
We're done here.

01:26:06.119 --> 01:26:07.995
We're not finished.

01:26:08.079 --> 01:26:10.330
Where are those fucking kids?

01:26:10.415 --> 01:26:12.249
What are you gonna do? Shoot me?

01:26:13.376 --> 01:26:15.794
Who's gonna do your dirty work for you?
You gonna do it yourself?

01:26:15.879 --> 01:26:18.422
You don't think l have that covered?

01:26:18.756 --> 01:26:21.258
We have your children, H.

01:26:21.885 --> 01:26:22.926
Do you understand?

01:26:23.511 --> 01:26:26.430
-Just get back to it. Right now!
-We need to calm down, okay?

01:26:27.098 --> 01:26:28.098
Shit.

01:26:29.434 --> 01:26:31.685
Put your fucking weapon down
or l'll fucking shoot you.

01:26:31.769 --> 01:26:35.189
No, don't shoot him. Don't shoot him !
lf he dies, we're screwed.

01:26:35.273 --> 01:26:36.648
Yusuf, put that gun down.

01:26:37.817 --> 01:26:38.942
Yusuf!

01:26:44.449 --> 01:26:45.490
lt's okay.

01:26:51.289 --> 01:26:53.290
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:26:54.584 --> 01:26:57.294
Please look after my children.

01:26:57.962 --> 01:26:59.046
-Jesus.
-No.

01:27:16.397 --> 01:27:18.023
We've done all we can.

01:27:20.777 --> 01:27:22.611
Let's just hope.

01:27:24.948 --> 01:27:26.782
We'll know soon enough.

01:27:31.329 --> 01:27:33.080
Been nice working with you, Agent Brody.

01:27:45.343 --> 01:27:47.177
This never happened.

01:27:48.137 --> 01:27:49.471
They never existed.

01:27:49.555 --> 01:27:54.226
Younger, the children, none of them.

01:28:43.568 --> 01:28:46.695
1 8570 CentineIa. That's the address.
We got it in sight.

01:28:48.698 --> 01:28:50.574
Location has been confirmed. You are a go.

01:28:52.577 --> 01:28:54.202
Get bomb disposal !

01:28:54.287 --> 01:28:56.705
We're at the northeast corner
of the building. We've located the device.

01:28:56.789 --> 01:28:57.873
Copy that.

01:28:58.916 --> 01:29:01.084
All right, stand clear and make room.

01:29:01.419 --> 01:29:03.503
Bomb disposal, you are clear at the scene.

01:29:27.028 --> 01:29:28.028
We're good.

01:29:28.112 --> 01:29:31.073
The bomb is disarmed.
l repeat, the bomb is disarmed.

01:29:35.620 --> 01:29:37.746
Congratulations, Major.
