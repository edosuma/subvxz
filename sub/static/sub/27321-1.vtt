01:45.730 --> 01:49.499
Hey!
This is the Sisters Brothers.

01:49.501 --> 01:54.337
The Commodore sent us.
He knows you have Blount.

01:54.339 --> 01:58.376
Hand him over
and the rest of you will live.

02:16.963 --> 02:18.764
Oh, Jesus.

02:22.102 --> 02:23.669
Goddamn!

02:26.707 --> 02:29.040
I can't see shit.

02:29.042 --> 02:30.775
- Ready?
- Yeah.

02:30.777 --> 02:32.045
Okay.

02:40.621 --> 02:42.355
Fuck. It's not him.

02:42.357 --> 02:43.722
Kick it.

02:47.461 --> 02:49.730
Holy shit!

03:35.844 --> 03:38.413
Blount? Blount?

03:38.415 --> 03:39.848
No! No!

03:46.522 --> 03:48.990
Please!

03:50.593 --> 03:53.863
Charlie.
Hey, did you get him?

03:54.563 --> 03:56.397
Yeah, he's dead.

03:56.399 --> 03:58.299
- The barn.
- What?

03:58.301 --> 03:59.934
The barn!

04:18.221 --> 04:21.391
- What are you doing?
- I'm not walking home.

04:21.392 --> 04:24.895
Eli! Eli!

04:25.562 --> 04:27.798
Don't be fucking stupid!
Let's go!

04:29.734 --> 04:32.803
Come on! They're
just fucking horses! Eli!

04:35.340 --> 04:36.641
Eli!

04:39.877 --> 04:42.014
How many you think
we killed?

04:42.780 --> 04:46.551
I don't know.
Six, seven?

04:49.955 --> 04:50.954
What?

04:50.956 --> 04:53.926
Well, we fucked
that up real good.

05:31.532 --> 05:33.666
What did the Commodore say?

05:34.768 --> 05:36.768
Did you mention the horses?

05:36.770 --> 05:38.939
Let's go get a drink.

05:43.977 --> 05:46.044
He said
if there'd been a lead man,

05:46.046 --> 05:48.713
we wouldn't have had problems
at the Blount ranch.

05:48.715 --> 05:52.719
He says for the next job,
we need to have a lead man.

05:53.922 --> 05:55.822
What's it mean
about money?

05:55.824 --> 05:57.657
It means more for me.

05:57.659 --> 06:01.494
No. My money, I mean.
Same as before?

06:01.496 --> 06:04.299
Well, no. Less, obviously.

06:06.701 --> 06:09.203
If the Commodore wants to pay
for a lead man, that's fine.

06:09.205 --> 06:11.806
But it's bad business
to short the man underneath.

06:12.707 --> 06:15.275
You're not asking
what the job is?

06:15.277 --> 06:16.644
No.

06:17.446 --> 06:19.114
Are you pouting?

06:21.816 --> 06:25.553
Hey.
Fuck off, we're not done yet.

06:25.555 --> 06:27.654
I'll tell you anyways.

06:27.656 --> 06:30.160
We have to go south
and find Morris.

06:31.094 --> 06:34.361
- The Commodore's John Morris?
- Mm-hmm.

06:34.363 --> 06:36.098
Why do we have to find Morris?

06:37.266 --> 06:41.102
He's after a prospector
named Hermann Kermit Warm.

06:41.104 --> 06:44.172
Great. He can find him
and kill him, then.

06:44.174 --> 06:45.473
End of story.

06:45.475 --> 06:48.108
Morris is a scout,
he's not a killer.

06:48.110 --> 06:50.979
The mission is, Morris finds
Warm, he holds him,

06:50.981 --> 06:54.184
we come in and finish the job.
That's the mission.

06:55.452 --> 06:57.051
What about the horses?

06:57.053 --> 06:58.786
What's your goddamn problem
with the horses?

06:58.788 --> 07:01.323
The Commodore told us he would
get us new horses.

07:01.325 --> 07:02.558
Isn't that what he did?

07:02.560 --> 07:04.459
No. For you he got a new horse.

07:04.461 --> 07:05.960
For me, he made room
in his stable

07:05.962 --> 07:07.896
and got rid of some horse meat.

07:07.898 --> 07:10.865
Don't you think we
should talk about this later?

07:10.867 --> 07:12.601
No, I don't need
the horse later.

07:12.603 --> 07:14.436
I need it now, for the job.

07:14.438 --> 07:16.640
The horse is fine.
Stop being a baby.

07:16.642 --> 07:19.874
Is it the words
"go halves" you don't like?

07:19.876 --> 07:22.146
The lead man is paying.

07:23.948 --> 07:26.050
- It's open.
- Thanks.

07:27.452 --> 07:29.820
Hyah! Hyah!

07:37.596 --> 07:41.400
Hey, come cut the back
of this for me.

07:58.618 --> 08:00.484
Just cut it off.

08:01.788 --> 08:03.856
You look funny.

08:20.474 --> 08:22.374
What did this
Hermann Warm do?

08:22.376 --> 08:24.775
He stole something
from the Commodore.

08:24.777 --> 08:26.143
Don't you find it strange,

08:26.145 --> 08:27.945
all these men
foolish enough to steal

08:27.947 --> 08:29.181
from such a dangerous man?

08:29.183 --> 08:32.351
How do they even steal
anything at all?

08:32.352 --> 08:34.852
We know how cautious
the Commodore is.

08:34.855 --> 08:37.457
Caution has nothing
to do with it.

08:37.458 --> 08:39.823
He does business
in every corner of the country,

08:39.826 --> 08:41.092
even overseas.

08:41.095 --> 08:43.696
The man can't be
everywhere at once.

08:43.698 --> 08:45.866
It stands to reason
he'd be victimized.

08:48.203 --> 08:49.903
Victimized?

08:50.771 --> 08:53.275
Yes, victimized.

08:55.043 --> 08:57.976
The Commodore is victimized?

08:57.978 --> 08:59.880
Well, what would you call it?

09:00.649 --> 09:02.849
If a man is forced
to protect his fortune

09:02.851 --> 09:05.285
with the likes of us,
what would you call it?

09:05.287 --> 09:06.953
Not victimized.

09:06.955 --> 09:08.788
You're not gonna start
nitpicking

09:08.790 --> 09:10.891
over every word, are you?

09:10.893 --> 09:14.029
What's your problem?
Are you upset?

09:14.863 --> 09:17.797
You're upset because
I'm the lead man? Is that it?

09:17.799 --> 09:20.634
If that's it, say so,
but stop splitting hairs.

09:20.636 --> 09:22.338
I'm not splitting hairs.

09:23.005 --> 09:26.374
You're using a strange word,
and I'm making you take notice.

10:12.590 --> 10:14.424
Tell me something.

10:14.426 --> 10:17.161
Could it be your
Miss Emilia Partridge?

10:17.695 --> 10:19.530
What are you talking about?

10:20.264 --> 10:21.664
Could it be the schoolteacher

10:21.666 --> 10:24.436
that gave you
that silly red scarf?

10:25.337 --> 10:28.705
The one you keep folding
and unfolding in secret.

10:28.707 --> 10:30.376
It's called a shawl.

10:30.844 --> 10:33.311
Am I not entitled
to any privacy?

10:34.112 --> 10:38.281
- You made plans with her?
- Plans?

10:38.283 --> 10:41.819
Start a family, have children,
marry her, something like that.

10:41.821 --> 10:43.353
I don't know.

10:43.355 --> 10:45.958
Why are you so interested
all of a sudden?

10:46.826 --> 10:49.094
I was just wondering
about family.

10:50.864 --> 10:53.165
You remember how Pa was with Ma?

10:53.867 --> 10:55.602
Yes, Charlie, I remember.

10:58.538 --> 11:00.306
Makes you think.

11:02.175 --> 11:04.411
You're not scared
to reproduce yourself?

11:07.714 --> 11:10.883
You do realize that our father
was stark-raving mad

11:10.885 --> 11:13.852
and we got his foul blood
in our veins?

11:13.854 --> 11:15.788
Our father drank, Charlie.

11:15.790 --> 11:17.756
TouchÃ©.

11:17.758 --> 11:20.759
That was his gift to us.

11:20.761 --> 11:22.795
That blood.

11:22.797 --> 11:25.466
That's why we're good
at what we do.

11:33.941 --> 11:35.576
The wheel of the wagon!

11:36.844 --> 11:38.546
Get that wheel down.

12:03.004 --> 12:04.405
Pull!

12:05.942 --> 12:08.575
- Come on, heave!
- Ho!

12:08.577 --> 12:09.777
- Heave!
- Ho!

12:09.779 --> 12:10.878
Come on, pull!

12:10.880 --> 12:13.248
Harder!

12:18.387 --> 12:21.890
- Pull!
- Pull!

12:21.892 --> 12:23.759
Forty cents, half a day.

12:28.264 --> 12:29.665
Want some water?

12:33.837 --> 12:37.205
<i>May 15th. Myrtle Creek, Oregon.</i>

12:37.207 --> 12:39.206
Want a little bit more
of that...?

12:39.208 --> 12:43.346
<i>The gold rush has made the
detective's job much easier.</i>

12:44.247 --> 12:46.982
<i>When you look
for a woman, a man,</i>

12:46.984 --> 12:50.585
<i>a horse or a dog,
just follow the gold.</i>

12:52.256 --> 12:55.490
<i>And soon enough, you'll find
whom or what you're after.</i>

13:01.799 --> 13:03.635
<i>Hermann Kermit Warm.</i>

13:04.602 --> 13:05.768
<i>Eats messily...</i>

13:05.770 --> 13:11.874
<i>five foot six, lean,
dark skin, no friends,</i>

13:11.876 --> 13:14.844
<i>no baggage, no money.</i>

13:27.960 --> 13:29.960
Sheamus, do you have
any cigarettes?

13:29.962 --> 13:32.663
No, I don't got any more.

13:32.665 --> 13:38.470
Sisters.
S-I-S-T-E-R-S, like "sisters."

13:43.207 --> 13:46.712
No, uh, nothing.
I would have remembered.

13:48.414 --> 13:51.950
Well, let's hope no news
is good news.

13:51.952 --> 13:54.117
What's the next town
on the trail?

13:54.119 --> 13:55.753
Myrtle Creek.

13:55.755 --> 13:58.258
- How far?
- Two days.

14:11.171 --> 14:13.641
Does that interest you, sir?

14:14.742 --> 14:16.209
What is it?

14:16.910 --> 14:18.576
It's a toothbrush, sir.

14:18.578 --> 14:22.915
To keep your teeth longer
and your breath fresher,

14:22.917 --> 14:25.886
and you use it with this powder.

14:28.924 --> 14:30.289
Thank you.

14:30.291 --> 14:32.057
Hey.
What kind of boots do you have?

14:32.059 --> 14:34.228
I'll be right with you, sir.

14:35.429 --> 14:37.665
What size do you take, sir?

15:01.456 --> 15:02.725
Hmm.

15:36.492 --> 15:39.628
It's good. Is it vegetables?

15:39.630 --> 15:41.096
Borscht.

15:41.098 --> 15:43.500
- I taste dill.
- Borscht.

16:05.091 --> 16:06.890
Get out!

16:06.892 --> 16:08.693
Stop!

16:09.393 --> 16:11.861
- Get outta here!
- Five, six...

16:11.863 --> 16:14.597
Seven, eight, nine...

16:14.599 --> 16:17.400
Oh, where did you go?
Where did you go?

16:17.402 --> 16:19.069
Go home, you fools.

16:19.071 --> 16:21.337
Fucking cowards!

16:21.339 --> 16:23.172
Oh come on!

16:23.174 --> 16:25.209
No one wants
to measure themselves up

16:25.211 --> 16:26.879
against Charlie Sisters?

16:27.780 --> 16:29.014
No one, really?

16:47.566 --> 16:51.335
- Stand up. Come on.
- Wait.

16:56.642 --> 16:57.944
I'm okay.

17:01.581 --> 17:03.884
Don't judge me, please.

17:04.384 --> 17:06.887
Some days we're stronger
than others.

17:11.290 --> 17:13.560
More planks!

17:16.263 --> 17:19.598
<i>May 17th, Wolf Creek.</i>

17:19.599 --> 17:24.237
<i>I travel through places that
didn't exist three months ago.</i>

17:24.239 --> 17:26.939
<i>First there are tents,
then houses.</i>

17:26.941 --> 17:30.242
<i>Then two months later,
shops with women</i>

17:30.244 --> 17:33.312
<i>fiercely discussing
the price of flour.</i>

17:33.314 --> 17:35.982
<i>I found this line by Thoreau.</i>

17:35.984 --> 17:37.483
<i>"This town too lies out..."</i>

17:37.485 --> 17:39.353
Have we seen each other before?

17:42.491 --> 17:43.489
We know each other.

17:43.491 --> 17:45.192
No, I don't think so.

17:45.194 --> 17:47.393
You were in Myrtle Creek
two days ago.

17:47.395 --> 17:51.364
Yes, I was,
like many other folk.

17:51.366 --> 17:54.068
Oh. Are you heading
to San Francisco?

17:54.070 --> 17:58.041
No, just to Jacksonville.

17:58.974 --> 18:00.440
To work?

18:00.442 --> 18:02.044
- Yes.
- Oh.

18:08.417 --> 18:12.121
Remember when that bull
charged in the theater?

18:14.624 --> 18:16.958
You?

18:16.960 --> 18:19.927
San Francisco?

18:19.929 --> 18:21.963
Gold?

18:21.965 --> 18:24.732
Yes, like many other folk.

18:30.274 --> 18:32.141
May I tell you something, sir?

18:33.042 --> 18:34.642
Of course.

18:34.644 --> 18:37.411
Typically, when a man wishes
another man good day,

18:37.413 --> 18:39.581
he smiles while facing
the other person;

18:39.583 --> 18:40.749
but once he passes by,

18:40.751 --> 18:42.851
the smile drops from his face.
Not you.

18:42.853 --> 18:46.057
Your smile remains on your lips
after you've turned away.

18:46.790 --> 18:51.193
Well, I... hadn't noticed.
It's common courtesy.

18:51.195 --> 18:53.196
Not only that.
Not everybody does it.

18:53.198 --> 18:58.301
You... take a genuine pleasure
in communing with others.

18:58.303 --> 19:00.505
Am I mistaken?

19:01.072 --> 19:03.540
I honestly do not know.

19:05.576 --> 19:07.611
Would you like
to join me for lunch?

19:08.512 --> 19:11.147
I would love to,
but I'm hard up at the moment.

19:11.149 --> 19:12.851
As my guest, of course.

19:13.752 --> 19:15.551
What takes you to Jacksonville?

19:15.553 --> 19:17.621
Business to settle. I'm meeting
two associates there.

19:17.623 --> 19:20.759
How are you making your way
down south?

19:21.327 --> 19:23.762
Uh, I have a seat
in a covered wagon.

19:25.164 --> 19:27.097
How long till you get to Frisco?

19:27.099 --> 19:29.233
The question is not how long
before I get there,

19:29.235 --> 19:33.539
the question is what state
will I be in when I do, if I do?

19:34.241 --> 19:36.175
To be honest with you...

19:38.044 --> 19:40.911
...my faith in my hosts
is very limited.

19:40.913 --> 19:43.281
They've rifled through
my belongings several times.

19:43.283 --> 19:46.184
Whenever I take out my money,
their eyes are like daggers.

19:46.186 --> 19:50.323
Mr. Warm! You ought to not
endanger yourself in that way.

19:50.325 --> 19:52.223
You have to be more careful
than that.

19:52.225 --> 19:54.292
What other choice do I have?

19:54.294 --> 19:56.328
Fifty, horseshoes included.

19:56.330 --> 19:57.429
Thirty-five.

19:57.431 --> 19:58.863
No, 35 is for a mule.

19:58.865 --> 20:00.498
Forty, with saddle bag
and shoes.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.634
Listen, you want to buy a horse,

20:02.636 --> 20:03.868
you pay the price for a horse.

20:03.870 --> 20:05.637
You're never gonna sell
this horse.

20:05.639 --> 20:07.372
Not at 50, not at 40.
She has a bad hip.

20:07.374 --> 20:10.508
Anyone would see that
with an eye. Forty.

20:10.510 --> 20:12.744
- Forty.
- What...?

20:12.746 --> 20:15.081
<i>Gentlemen, I have found him.</i>

20:15.083 --> 20:16.882
<i>I have managed to make
his acquaintance</i>

20:16.884 --> 20:19.453
<i>and have arranged
to travel with him.</i>

20:19.455 --> 20:20.820
<i>If all goes well,</i>

20:20.822 --> 20:23.257
<i>we should be in Jacksonville
in seven days.</i>

20:23.757 --> 20:26.158
<i>I will try to hold him
until your arrival</i>

20:26.160 --> 20:29.362
<i>and find a secluded place
to hand him over.</i>

20:29.364 --> 20:32.498
"Make haste. John Morris."

20:32.500 --> 20:34.535
Well, chalk one up for Morris.

20:34.970 --> 20:37.503
Even if I don't like
the "make haste."

20:37.505 --> 20:39.805
Who does that asshole
think he is?

20:39.807 --> 20:41.607
When did they pass through?

20:41.609 --> 20:43.243
Four days ago.

20:43.245 --> 20:46.413
Is there a faster way
to Jacksonville, off trail?

20:46.415 --> 20:48.483
Well, it's rougher
to go up the mountains,

20:48.485 --> 20:50.619
but you'll save
a couple of days.

21:11.874 --> 21:15.577
The rain muddied it
all up. I can't see a thing.

21:16.746 --> 21:20.050
We must be able to pick up
the trail somewhere.

21:51.249 --> 21:52.781
Charlie.

21:52.783 --> 21:54.250
- Charlie...
- Peek-a-boo!

21:57.489 --> 21:58.720
Damn fool.

21:58.722 --> 22:03.093
I thought you
were gonna kiss me.

22:04.329 --> 22:09.599
Fuck you.

23:14.335 --> 23:16.437
Ah! Let me relieve you of this.

23:22.243 --> 23:25.013
I've only just noticed
that's the only bag you have.

23:25.880 --> 23:29.516
I guess you're gonna
have to buy gear

23:29.518 --> 23:31.086
when you get to San Francisco.

23:32.687 --> 23:34.087
I don't need equipment.

23:35.990 --> 23:38.891
You're going to look
for gold in a river

23:38.893 --> 23:41.161
without a shovel,
a pail, a cradle?

23:41.163 --> 23:44.266
This is the great challenge
that all prospectors face.

23:44.900 --> 23:47.369
How do I get at what's
just beneath my feet?

23:47.937 --> 23:49.803
There's only two solutions,
of course:

23:49.805 --> 23:51.904
hard labor and good luck.

23:51.906 --> 23:54.508
I've been working
on a third solution

23:54.510 --> 23:55.809
for many years.

23:55.811 --> 23:59.349
One that is simpler, faster,
more certain.

23:59.815 --> 24:01.917
And I think today, I found it.

24:03.954 --> 24:05.787
You don't believe me.

24:05.789 --> 24:09.158
No offense, Warm.
Frankly, I'm having a hard time.

24:11.261 --> 24:14.497
You know it's funny,
people usually don't believe me.

24:16.166 --> 24:18.502
And then when they do,
they want to kill me.

24:20.371 --> 24:22.206
What is this idea?

24:25.909 --> 24:28.111
Well, I told you I'm a chemist.

24:29.846 --> 24:33.150
It's the idea of a chemist,
it's a formula.

24:33.651 --> 24:35.217
Abracadabra?

24:35.219 --> 24:36.488
No.

24:37.321 --> 24:39.323
A divining substance.

24:42.126 --> 24:47.198
A divining substance you...
you mix in the river water?

24:55.707 --> 24:58.807
This formula, this diviner,

24:58.809 --> 25:00.811
call it what you may...

25:02.481 --> 25:07.953
...as a man of science,
have you ever tested it?

25:15.728 --> 25:17.227
Eli, wake up.

25:17.229 --> 25:18.995
- I don't feel good.
- What?

25:18.997 --> 25:22.902
- I don't feel good.
- You don't feel good?

25:26.172 --> 25:28.572
Oh, shit. What happened
to your face?

25:28.574 --> 25:29.740
I don't know.

25:29.742 --> 25:31.575
It's all swollen,
and your neck...

25:31.577 --> 25:34.078
You look like one of those dogs.

25:34.080 --> 25:36.247
What is it?
The... the mastiff.

25:36.249 --> 25:38.483
Fuck you! I'm sick.

25:38.485 --> 25:39.751
All right, sit up.

25:39.753 --> 25:42.154
- Let me look at you.
- Ow!

25:42.156 --> 25:45.191
Oh, God. Got blood
sloshing around in there.

25:47.494 --> 25:49.594
Can you sit in your saddle?

25:49.596 --> 25:51.098
I don't know.

25:51.765 --> 25:53.267
I'm freezing.

26:44.554 --> 26:46.352
I'm tired, Charlie.

26:46.354 --> 26:49.258
- I know.
- I'm really tired.

26:50.192 --> 26:51.594
Sleep.

26:53.262 --> 26:54.530
I'm here.

27:01.138 --> 27:04.204
There you are,
my sweeties.

27:04.206 --> 27:05.408
Pa!

27:06.443 --> 27:08.710
I've looked
all over for you.

27:08.712 --> 27:09.910
Pa?

27:09.912 --> 27:11.946
Come closer.

27:11.948 --> 27:14.884
Let me take you in my arms.

27:16.587 --> 27:18.952
No. No!

28:08.373 --> 28:09.741
You okay?

28:21.588 --> 28:24.323
What... What happened?

28:26.225 --> 28:29.229
Well, this gentleman wandered
into camp last night.

28:30.330 --> 28:35.235
He got your horse real good.
He went right for him.

28:36.135 --> 28:39.437
Fuck. The horses?

28:41.842 --> 28:43.642
It's the horses that woke me up.

28:45.513 --> 28:47.146
What a fucking night.

28:54.822 --> 28:57.289
I had a dream about Pa
last night.

28:57.291 --> 28:59.391
Well, that's perfect.

28:59.393 --> 29:01.527
I'm sick of this place.
It reeks of death.

29:01.529 --> 29:04.599
Everything is fucking soaked.
Let's go.

29:06.434 --> 29:08.835
Why you taking off your clothes?
Let's go.

29:08.837 --> 29:11.138
I'm hot. I'm too hot.

29:41.705 --> 29:43.839
Third house, on the right.

29:45.173 --> 29:47.476
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

30:36.494 --> 30:37.595
Shit.

30:39.163 --> 30:41.265
Oh.

30:42.868 --> 30:44.903
Are you looking for this?

30:48.206 --> 30:49.842
Get back.

30:50.441 --> 30:51.844
Get back!

30:57.083 --> 30:58.817
What's the matter?

31:00.486 --> 31:01.686
Are you not going to say,

31:01.688 --> 31:03.589
"Listen, Hermann,
I can explain"?

31:04.657 --> 31:05.924
Huh?

31:06.992 --> 31:09.660
Pick that up.

31:09.662 --> 31:11.163
Face that way.

31:12.498 --> 31:14.901
Put it on your left hand.

31:20.305 --> 31:21.875
Let me see your hand.

31:24.010 --> 31:26.746
Good, now the other one.

31:51.605 --> 31:54.442
If I take it off,
will you keep quiet?

32:15.263 --> 32:16.898
Are we waiting for your friends?

32:22.336 --> 32:24.571
How could you be so two-faced?

32:24.573 --> 32:26.539
What taught you such duplicity?

32:26.541 --> 32:29.844
Is it greed? I hadn't noticed
that in you, I really hadn't.

32:29.846 --> 32:32.782
You keep quiet
or I'll put it back in.

32:36.153 --> 32:38.320
You think they'll kill me?

32:39.122 --> 32:41.758
They won't kill me.

32:42.825 --> 32:44.594
Not right away.

32:47.463 --> 32:49.900
What do you think
your Commodore wants?

32:51.434 --> 32:54.135
He's the one who tried
to rob me in Oregon City.

32:54.137 --> 32:55.369
He's after my formula.

32:55.371 --> 32:57.340
- My invention.
- So what?

32:58.909 --> 33:01.408
So your friends, your friends

33:01.410 --> 33:03.347
are on their way here to
torture me.

33:06.117 --> 33:08.552
To torture me,
did you know that?

33:14.758 --> 33:19.896
They'll cut off my fingers,
they'll burn my feet...

33:19.898 --> 33:21.931
gouge out my eyes.

33:24.035 --> 33:26.070
They'll torture me till I talk.

33:28.206 --> 33:30.541
Morris, can I ask you something?

33:33.444 --> 33:35.446
Are you gonna watch?

33:39.450 --> 33:42.453
Are you gonna write it down
in your book of adventures?

33:44.189 --> 33:45.690
Warm...

33:53.232 --> 33:54.767
I'm...

33:56.735 --> 33:58.434
It's this world.

33:58.436 --> 34:00.773
It's an abomination.

34:09.380 --> 34:11.449
It's an abomination.

34:14.553 --> 34:18.489
<i>He stopped talking,
didn't say another word.</i>

34:21.828 --> 34:25.565
<i>He watched the sun rise
through the window.</i>

34:58.066 --> 35:01.203
Let's go.

35:01.936 --> 35:05.272
You don't think
you're making a mistake?

35:05.274 --> 35:07.042
I don't know.

35:09.778 --> 35:11.113
Probably.

35:47.918 --> 35:50.584
How do we go
about this with Warm?

35:50.586 --> 35:51.919
Like we usually do.

35:51.921 --> 35:54.555
Well, usually
there's no Morris.

35:54.557 --> 35:56.058
Morris hands over Warm.

35:56.060 --> 35:58.128
We go someplace quiet
and finish the job.

35:59.263 --> 36:00.329
You done?

36:00.331 --> 36:02.132
- Yes.
- Okay.

36:32.664 --> 36:34.266
You go round back.

36:58.657 --> 37:00.192
You're a good boy.

37:05.664 --> 37:07.564
You heard me!

37:14.640 --> 37:15.806
Whoa!

37:15.808 --> 37:17.709
Christ, Charlie, I almost shot!

37:17.711 --> 37:20.247
- They're not here.
- Where are they?

37:21.148 --> 37:23.848
They left, four days ago.

37:23.850 --> 37:26.420
Morris left a note. Shit!

37:27.087 --> 37:30.321
"Dear gentlemen,
I'm sorry to inform you

37:30.323 --> 37:35.294
"that Hermann Kermit Warm has
made a precipitate departure.

37:35.296 --> 37:38.130
"He must have hopped
a wagon train and left town.

37:38.132 --> 37:41.401
"I am going after him
as of today. Good luck.

37:41.403 --> 37:43.068
Sincerely, John Morris."

37:43.070 --> 37:47.341
"Hermann Kermit Warm has made
a precipitate departure."

37:48.342 --> 37:50.878
Who the fuck is he kidding?

37:52.180 --> 37:56.018
Who's this pretentious
fucking asshole kidding?

38:04.826 --> 38:09.229
Well, we tried.
So what now?

38:09.231 --> 38:10.864
We keep on.

38:10.866 --> 38:12.899
We said between Jacksonville
and Mayfield,

38:12.901 --> 38:15.070
and we're only in Jacksonville.

38:16.839 --> 38:20.140
God damn it, the job isn't
Jacksonville or Mayfield,

38:20.142 --> 38:21.975
the job is to kill Warm.

38:21.977 --> 38:24.948
Why don't you say it louder?
I don't think he heard you.

38:26.883 --> 38:31.051
Wherever the fuck Warm is,
Mayfield or wherever,

38:31.053 --> 38:33.822
we go there
and get it over with.

38:34.524 --> 38:36.656
When will we be back home?

38:36.658 --> 38:40.296
Once we're done
with the job, Eli.

38:45.069 --> 38:48.371
I get the idea they're farther
and farther ahead of us.

38:51.708 --> 38:53.708
How long were we in that forest?

38:53.710 --> 38:55.944
Well, your spells and illnesses

38:55.946 --> 38:58.548
didn't save us any time,
that's for sure.

38:58.550 --> 39:00.284
What does that mean?

39:01.286 --> 39:02.783
This is my fault?

39:02.785 --> 39:04.953
Yeah, a little. Isn't it?

39:04.955 --> 39:07.424
You want to talk about
your constant drunkenness?

39:08.192 --> 39:11.294
Huh? That cost us any time?

39:11.296 --> 39:13.862
Days when you can't even sit up
in the saddle straight?

39:13.864 --> 39:16.566
The other morning
when you puked on yourself?

39:16.568 --> 39:19.101
My spells.

39:19.103 --> 39:20.771
My ass.

39:23.275 --> 39:24.574
What we need to do

39:24.576 --> 39:26.677
is to put an end
to all this barbarity.

39:27.078 --> 39:29.245
Put an end to all this violence,

39:29.247 --> 39:30.780
find a solution for it.

39:30.782 --> 39:33.016
By inventing a new society.

39:33.018 --> 39:35.018
A society where
the relationships

39:35.020 --> 39:37.520
among men is governed
by respect

39:37.522 --> 39:39.458
and the absence of profit.

39:40.025 --> 39:43.429
Thus a society without greed.
Do you agree?

39:45.097 --> 39:47.466
What does this have to do
with your formula?

39:48.067 --> 39:51.167
You're looking for gold too,
like everyone else.

39:51.169 --> 39:55.474
But, but... for me, the gold
is just a stepping stone.

39:58.377 --> 40:01.313
John, I'm serious.
To found a new society.

40:01.315 --> 40:03.481
One... one that will
consecrate itself

40:03.483 --> 40:07.251
not to profit or gold,
but its spiritual development,

40:07.253 --> 40:08.986
its own subsistence,
nothing more,

40:08.988 --> 40:10.890
the education of its children.

40:11.325 --> 40:14.394
And where do you intend
to create this society?

40:17.599 --> 40:19.333
Dallas.

40:21.402 --> 40:23.036
Northern Texas.

40:23.937 --> 40:26.340
There are already many people
waiting there.

40:27.374 --> 40:30.177
More are on the way from Europe.

40:41.822 --> 40:46.794
Well, I can see I've lost you.
John?

40:48.129 --> 40:49.398
John?

40:56.137 --> 40:58.237
One evening, you told me
about your father,

40:58.239 --> 41:02.411
that you left him because
there was no place for you.

41:04.680 --> 41:07.749
As for me,
all I can say is that I...

41:07.751 --> 41:09.583
I left my family out of hatred

41:09.585 --> 41:10.950
and that my father was
the person

41:10.952 --> 41:13.053
I despised most in this world.

41:13.055 --> 41:16.890
I despised everything about him.

41:16.892 --> 41:18.726
I sincerely thought
I had been freed

41:18.728 --> 41:20.261
of all that until tonight.

41:20.263 --> 41:24.198
Listening to you,
what do I realize?

41:24.200 --> 41:27.034
That most of the things
that I thought I'd been doing

41:27.036 --> 41:29.539
these past years, freely...

41:30.540 --> 41:34.077
...the opinions that I thought
I had of my own volition...

41:37.147 --> 41:40.351
...were in fact dictated
by my hatred towards that man.

41:47.924 --> 41:50.494
I'm 35 years old and my...

41:51.696 --> 41:54.899
...life is like
an empty cylinder.

42:14.820 --> 42:18.055
<i>My dear solicitor,
my dear friend,</i>

42:18.790 --> 42:21.424
<i>after much thought,
I've changed my mind</i>

42:21.426 --> 42:23.828
<i>about the measures
concerning my finances</i>

42:23.830 --> 42:26.398
<i>related to you
in my last letter.</i>

42:27.099 --> 42:29.099
I accept my father's inheritance

42:29.101 --> 42:31.201
<i>and ask you to wire
3,000 dollars</i>

42:31.203 --> 42:33.803
<i>to the Project Bank
in San Francisco.</i>

42:35.040 --> 42:36.741
<i>Finally, I will not be</i>

42:36.743 --> 42:38.444
<i>in Washington until next year.</i>

42:40.912 --> 42:44.384
<i>I send you my friendship
and I shake your hand.</i>

42:45.417 --> 42:48.388
<i>Yours, John Morris.</i>

42:50.956 --> 42:55.993
It's us. W&M, Warm and Morris.

42:55.995 --> 42:59.564
Our company's insignia.
What do you think?

43:01.401 --> 43:02.867
I like it.

43:02.869 --> 43:05.670
Hey! Come on over here!

43:05.672 --> 43:07.508
I'm glad to hear that.

43:10.878 --> 43:12.413
I like it.

43:30.165 --> 43:33.999
You think this man came here
because it was called Mayfield,

43:34.001 --> 43:37.202
or they started calling it that
once he got here?

43:37.204 --> 43:39.407
Maybe it all belongs to him.

43:40.107 --> 43:42.444
Well, they sure like that name.

43:52.554 --> 43:56.557
Hello, we're looking for a man
named Warm.

43:56.559 --> 43:58.090
Short, dark skinned.

43:58.092 --> 44:00.729
We think he passed through here
a few days ago.

44:01.564 --> 44:03.530
I can't help you, mister.

44:03.532 --> 44:07.601
No? What about a tall man,
brown hair, around 40?

44:07.603 --> 44:10.204
I don't know, mister.
I don't get mixed up in it.

44:10.206 --> 44:12.973
You don't
get mixed up in it, do ya?

44:12.975 --> 44:14.608
Give us some whiskey.

44:14.610 --> 44:16.176
Normal or Mayfield'

44:16.178 --> 44:18.648
Normal. Bottle, two glasses.

44:19.649 --> 44:21.682
You're looking for someone?

44:21.684 --> 44:24.786
Because usually I'm the one
people ask for news in this town.

44:24.788 --> 44:27.122
Who are you?

44:27.624 --> 44:28.656
Mayfield.

44:28.658 --> 44:31.292
Ah. The great man himself.

44:31.294 --> 44:34.062
My brother and I are looking
for someone named Hermann Warm.

44:34.064 --> 44:35.798
Short, dark skinned.

44:35.800 --> 44:38.800
Probably passed through
what, five, six days ago?

44:38.802 --> 44:41.571
Warm? No, I don't recall.

44:42.672 --> 44:44.474
This man a friend of yours?

44:45.810 --> 44:48.744
He ran out on a debt
to our employer,

44:48.746 --> 44:51.082
the Commodore, in Oregon City.

44:52.750 --> 44:54.685
We're the Sisters Brothers.

44:56.721 --> 45:00.658
Good to meet you men.
You planning on staying long?

45:02.593 --> 45:05.795
Hmm, well, that depends.

45:05.797 --> 45:07.964
We'll be leaving first thing.

45:07.966 --> 45:10.666
That depends.

45:10.668 --> 45:13.068
Why do you keep telling
everyone your life story?

45:13.070 --> 45:14.771
The Commodore,
the Sisters Brothers.

45:14.773 --> 45:17.674
Did you not see how honored
that woman was to put us up?

45:17.676 --> 45:21.044
And besides, I like to know if
our reputation has preceded us.

45:21.046 --> 45:24.514
Unlike you, brother,
I'm proud of what I do.

45:24.516 --> 45:27.417
What does that mean?

45:27.419 --> 45:29.084
It means things will be
as usual:

45:29.086 --> 45:30.720
you'll get drunk
as a fish tonight

45:30.722 --> 45:32.023
and be sick as a dog tomorrow.

45:32.025 --> 45:33.858
You're forgetting something.

45:33.860 --> 45:35.826
I'm gonna fuck like a rabbit.

45:35.828 --> 45:37.193
Another day up our ass.

45:37.195 --> 45:38.963
Don't pay attention to him.

45:38.965 --> 45:40.331
He's crabby and he's old.

46:26.313 --> 46:28.314
- Thank you.
- He can pour his own liquor.

46:28.316 --> 46:29.848
- Hey!
- Pardon me?

46:29.850 --> 46:32.351
- He can pour his own liquor.
- Sure thing.

46:32.353 --> 46:36.356
Hey!
Look who's awake! Look at that.

46:36.358 --> 46:39.728
Big night with the big boy.
Where are you going?

46:40.963 --> 46:42.595
Hey, have you noticed
how many raccoons

46:42.597 --> 46:45.299
there are in this town,
like, dead raccoons?

46:47.068 --> 46:48.935
It's a shitty town
to be a raccoon in.

46:48.937 --> 46:50.505
How much just to talk?

46:53.609 --> 46:58.144
We can act like
you're giving me this shawl

46:58.146 --> 47:01.884
and you consider it
a valuable object.

47:04.720 --> 47:06.187
Understand?

47:08.658 --> 47:10.359
With a kind word.

47:18.334 --> 47:21.201
- Here.
- No. With a kind...

47:21.203 --> 47:22.737
What?

47:22.739 --> 47:25.106
- I don't know what...
- Simple words.

47:25.108 --> 47:29.911
"I thought it might get cold."
I'm leaving

47:29.913 --> 47:31.513
- and you're giving me this.
- I...

47:31.515 --> 47:33.213
"I thought
it might get cold."

47:33.215 --> 47:35.652
- I thought it might get cold.
- No, you have to...

47:37.120 --> 47:40.255
"This shawl..." Take it.

47:40.257 --> 47:42.225
- "This shawl..."
- This shawl...

47:44.962 --> 47:47.932
"..is a little piece of me
that's traveling with you."

47:48.666 --> 47:50.532
This shawl is a little piece
of me...

47:50.534 --> 47:54.371
You have to... with your eyes.
You have to look at it.

47:56.407 --> 47:58.843
Like it means something.

48:00.979 --> 48:04.114
This shawl is like

48:04.116 --> 48:06.984
a little part of me
is traveling with you.

48:11.222 --> 48:13.657
I put a drop of
my perfume on it.

48:13.659 --> 48:15.357
Good.

48:15.359 --> 48:17.694
"Can I steal a kiss from you?"

48:17.696 --> 48:21.767
- Yes.
- No, you say that.

48:22.400 --> 48:24.837
Can I steal a kiss from you?

48:26.105 --> 48:27.639
Yes.

48:34.781 --> 48:36.015
Yes.

48:50.064 --> 48:51.966
You're not well?

48:52.900 --> 48:57.337
- Did I hurt you?
- No. No, not at all. I...

49:00.440 --> 49:02.575
You're just very kind...

49:04.512 --> 49:07.746
...and gentle,
and I'm not used to it.

49:07.748 --> 49:09.482
Please let me go.

49:11.085 --> 49:14.119
- Let me go.
- But I'll pay you.

49:14.121 --> 49:17.057
I need to go, please.

49:23.632 --> 49:24.833
Be careful.

49:25.199 --> 49:26.567
About what?

49:27.635 --> 49:29.037
Mayfield.

50:12.082 --> 50:13.681
Charlie?

50:13.683 --> 50:16.085
Charlie?

50:16.552 --> 50:19.622
Charlie? Charlie?

50:21.557 --> 50:24.127
There you are.

50:27.664 --> 50:30.000
- You have to go.
- Okay, okay, okay.

50:30.968 --> 50:32.603
Charlie.

50:33.837 --> 50:36.039
Charlie, wake up.

50:37.007 --> 50:39.509
Charlie, you have to wake up.

50:40.278 --> 50:42.377
They're coming. You get up.

50:42.379 --> 50:44.315
- You get up!
- I don't want to.

50:44.649 --> 50:48.119
You get up.
Mom says get up.

50:48.518 --> 50:50.088
- Get up!
- Okay.

50:51.656 --> 50:53.524
Put your boots on.

50:54.225 --> 50:55.660
Come on.

50:57.662 --> 50:59.462
Hey, Charlie, Charlie.

50:59.464 --> 51:02.430
Can you shoot? Can you shoot?

51:02.432 --> 51:03.935
I'm not at my best.

51:05.371 --> 51:07.605
Don't you puke on me.

51:18.583 --> 51:21.452
Getting ready to leave Mayfield?

51:24.523 --> 51:26.558
All right.

51:30.063 --> 51:31.965
Let's just calm down.

51:33.098 --> 51:35.233
We have money.

51:35.235 --> 51:37.304
Just tell us what Mayfield
is paying you.

51:37.670 --> 51:39.736
I don't think you're going
to live long enough

51:39.738 --> 51:41.339
to find that out. Boys?

51:41.341 --> 51:44.275
It's funny that there's
so many few words

51:44.277 --> 51:46.544
to describe things
here in Mayfield.

51:46.546 --> 51:48.047
Charlie?

51:48.049 --> 51:50.048
Mayfield's whiskey
and Mayfield's hotel.

51:50.050 --> 51:52.449
- Mayfield's fucking Mayfield.
- Charlie?

51:52.451 --> 51:55.086
- Mayfield bullshit.
- Please let me handle this.

51:55.088 --> 51:56.489
Mayfield's raccoon...

51:57.325 --> 51:59.657
- Look...
- Mayfield's horses.

51:59.659 --> 52:01.228
My brother's drunk.

52:01.862 --> 52:04.864
Why don't you just tell us
how much you want?

52:06.499 --> 52:09.234
No, Eli...

52:09.236 --> 52:12.106
It's not about the money.

52:14.041 --> 52:16.577
It's about reputation.

52:18.847 --> 52:21.814
Being the guys that killed
the Sisters Brothers.

52:21.816 --> 52:24.118
You shut up now.

52:26.154 --> 52:28.156
Prestige.

52:59.455 --> 53:00.957
Oh, my God!

53:02.258 --> 53:06.096
Warm said he needed an investor
for some prospecting scheme.

53:07.197 --> 53:09.997
I couldn't make heads
or tails of his story.

53:09.999 --> 53:13.970
I thought he was a clown,
but when I saw Morris...

53:14.804 --> 53:18.206
...I reckoned if
the Commodore's interested,

53:18.208 --> 53:19.841
it might be worthwhile.

53:19.843 --> 53:21.243
Did Morris leave a letter
for us?

53:21.245 --> 53:23.945
No. He was
just traveling with Warm.

53:23.947 --> 53:26.716
- Really?
- Hm-hmm.

53:28.118 --> 53:30.218
And why did you want to kill us?

53:35.626 --> 53:38.163
I'll repeat and then I'll
strike.

53:38.830 --> 53:41.663
When I realized Warm
had something of value,

53:41.665 --> 53:44.099
I sent some guys after them
to bring him back.

53:44.101 --> 53:46.436
So now there's more men
on Warm's tail?

53:46.438 --> 53:48.538
Yeah.

53:48.540 --> 53:51.441
Well, all right, Mayfield,

53:51.443 --> 53:53.477
you're not gonna like
what comes next,

53:53.479 --> 53:57.113
but it's the price to pay
for messing with our business.

53:57.115 --> 53:59.084
Open your safe.

54:01.186 --> 54:04.789
No, never.

54:09.594 --> 54:12.031
Oh, shit.

54:26.580 --> 54:28.814
I think you should
say something to them.

54:33.652 --> 54:35.255
Uh...

54:38.925 --> 54:43.163
After a series
of dramatic events...

54:44.630 --> 54:49.134
...that she had only herself
to blame for,

54:49.136 --> 54:50.670
um...

54:53.307 --> 54:54.975
Mayfield is dead.

54:55.675 --> 54:58.077
No, no, no, not like that.

54:58.079 --> 55:00.780
You don't have anything
more positive to say?

55:02.048 --> 55:04.416
My brother and I have
some good news for you people.

55:04.418 --> 55:07.253
You can change the name
of your fucking town. Ya!

55:26.608 --> 55:29.910
Anyway,
we know one thing now.

55:29.912 --> 55:32.114
We know Morris
has joined the enemy.

55:32.914 --> 55:34.980
I never liked that gentleman,

55:34.982 --> 55:38.787
but I must say
this is the icing on the cake.

55:39.521 --> 55:41.457
Still something
I don't understand.

55:41.857 --> 55:45.092
What does this Warm have
that's so interesting?

55:45.094 --> 55:47.694
The Commodore
sends men after him,

55:47.696 --> 55:49.865
Mayfield sends men after him,

55:50.332 --> 55:54.368
and now Morris falls in
with him. What does he have?

55:54.370 --> 55:56.805
He has a formula.

55:58.942 --> 56:01.177
It's a chemical product.

56:01.945 --> 56:04.313
Supposedly,
you pour it in the river,

56:04.315 --> 56:05.745
it lights up all the gold,

56:05.747 --> 56:07.748
and you just bend down
to pick it up.

56:07.750 --> 56:10.420
You don't believe that stuff,
Charlie, come on.

56:11.355 --> 56:14.722
We've seen our fair share of
hucksters with miracle products.

56:14.724 --> 56:19.363
Yeah, but the Commodore
believed in this one. Yeah.

56:20.030 --> 56:22.131
Why didn't you tell me
about this before?

56:23.334 --> 56:25.035
I had orders not to.

56:26.570 --> 56:28.270
Anything else you're hiding
from me?

56:28.272 --> 56:33.010
Well... The Commodore's orders
are clear cut.

56:33.678 --> 56:36.812
Before we kill Warm,
we are to extract from him,

56:36.814 --> 56:38.981
by whatever violent means
necessary,

56:38.983 --> 56:41.684
the recipe for his formula.

56:41.686 --> 56:44.922
- In other words, torture him?
- More or less.

56:46.091 --> 56:47.259
Huh.

56:51.497 --> 56:52.930
Hyah!

57:02.308 --> 57:05.244
How far ahead do you
think Mayfield's guys got?

57:05.745 --> 57:07.311
Well, if they're as stupid

57:07.313 --> 57:10.815
as the last guys we killed,
I'd say we're about even.

57:12.851 --> 57:17.121
I like it here.
There's a fortuitous energy.

57:17.123 --> 57:19.857
What the hell
is a "fortuitous energy"?

57:19.859 --> 57:23.130
You feel it, dummy.

57:25.331 --> 57:27.133
You know what, brother?

57:27.900 --> 57:30.669
I don't think you and I
have ever gone so far.

57:30.671 --> 57:33.804
You mean between us,
in our conversation?

57:33.806 --> 57:35.707
What are you talking about?

57:35.709 --> 57:37.679
I meant in a straight line.

57:38.211 --> 57:41.247
You and I have never gone
so far in a straight line.

58:45.013 --> 58:48.183
Goddamn, this place is Babylon!

58:54.257 --> 58:56.357
You know,
when we find Warm,

58:56.359 --> 58:59.227
it won't be worth looking
for a quiet spot.

58:59.229 --> 59:01.664
There isn't one in this whole
place.

59:02.365 --> 59:04.932
More importantly,
nobody will care.

59:04.934 --> 59:07.034
We can kill anyone
we want here.

59:07.036 --> 59:11.275
Fuck! Everyone's mind
is focused on something else.

59:19.949 --> 59:21.452
What is in there?

59:22.453 --> 59:24.121
Hmm, hotel?

59:25.556 --> 59:27.158
Let's stay there.

59:29.093 --> 59:32.696
- Looks kind of expensive, no?
- Exactly.

59:33.831 --> 59:36.131
That is the water closet
in there.

59:36.133 --> 59:39.336
And that is the bathroom,
with hot water.

59:40.739 --> 59:43.275
And here is your room.

01:00:16.375 --> 01:00:19.243
Charlie, Charlie!
Come and see this!

01:00:19.245 --> 01:00:21.247
Come here, look at this.

01:00:23.449 --> 01:00:26.285
A bit of comfort
in uncertain times.

01:00:27.654 --> 01:00:30.054
You know, I was thinking.

01:00:30.056 --> 01:00:31.857
We could just go back to Oregon
City

01:00:31.859 --> 01:00:33.460
and say we couldn't find them.

01:00:36.063 --> 01:00:37.896
And tell what to the Commodore?

01:00:37.898 --> 01:00:41.668
The truth. Morris ran off
with Warm, destination unknown.

01:00:42.369 --> 01:00:44.069
We can't be expect
to find them

01:00:44.071 --> 01:00:46.340
without a single clue
to guide us.

01:00:46.975 --> 01:00:49.809
And we don't even know
if Mayfield's men

01:00:49.811 --> 01:00:51.111
already found him.

01:00:51.946 --> 01:00:56.149
Okay, what are you getting at,
brother?

01:00:58.185 --> 01:01:00.419
Between what we made
in Mayfield,

01:01:00.421 --> 01:01:02.388
what we have at home
and the rest,

01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:05.694
we have enough to ditch
the Commodore for good.

01:01:06.561 --> 01:01:07.963
Why would we do that?

01:01:08.563 --> 01:01:12.734
You've never thought
about stopping?

01:01:14.202 --> 01:01:17.470
- And do what?
- I don't know.

01:01:17.472 --> 01:01:19.373
We could open a store together.

01:01:19.375 --> 01:01:21.577
What store?

01:01:22.177 --> 01:01:26.813
Look, we've had a good
long run, we're still alive,

01:01:26.815 --> 01:01:29.785
we've a bit of our youth left.
It's a chance to get out.

01:01:30.586 --> 01:01:36.358
A store? A way out?
What is this fucking nonsense?

01:01:40.563 --> 01:01:42.264
Well...

01:01:44.133 --> 01:01:49.606
...we've established
that you want to quit, so quit.

01:01:50.206 --> 01:01:51.741
Meaning what?

01:01:52.709 --> 01:01:54.477
If I stop, you'll continue?

01:01:54.979 --> 01:01:57.313
Of course I continue.

01:01:59.316 --> 01:02:01.718
I just need a new partner.

01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:05.756
Rex has asked for work
in the past.

01:02:06.323 --> 01:02:07.758
Rex?

01:02:09.125 --> 01:02:11.395
Rex is a talking dog.

01:02:11.997 --> 01:02:14.230
He's obedient like a dog.

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:18.834
I could ask Sanchez.

01:02:18.836 --> 01:02:20.336
Sanchez?

01:02:20.338 --> 01:02:23.940
You would really trust Sanchez

01:02:23.942 --> 01:02:26.578
and that idiot Rex
to protect you?

01:02:28.346 --> 01:02:31.182
Because you protect me?

01:02:32.350 --> 01:02:34.350
Is that what you have
to tell yourself

01:02:34.352 --> 01:02:36.822
to stay "nice guy Eli"?

01:02:38.322 --> 01:02:41.491
But we are the Sisters Brothers.

01:02:41.493 --> 01:02:45.296
The Sisters Brothers,
you and me.

01:02:48.033 --> 01:02:50.867
Huh! You made your decision.

01:02:50.869 --> 01:02:52.638
And it's fine by me.

01:02:53.205 --> 01:02:55.908
It'll be welcome news
to the Commodore also.

01:03:00.646 --> 01:03:03.049
Alright, so...

01:03:03.682 --> 01:03:07.685
...we finish this last job
and then part ways.

01:03:07.687 --> 01:03:11.990
Why do you have to say it
like that? "We'll part ways"?

01:03:11.992 --> 01:03:13.624
How would you like me to say it?

01:03:13.626 --> 01:03:18.161
If I stay with the Commodore
and you open your store...

01:03:18.163 --> 01:03:20.731
You're saying we won't
see each other any more?

01:03:20.733 --> 01:03:24.335
Of course we'll see each other,
any time I come to town.

01:03:24.337 --> 01:03:26.471
If I need a shirt
or some under things.

01:03:26.473 --> 01:03:29.274
Why do you have
to speak to me so rudely?

01:03:29.276 --> 01:03:30.609
To choose those words?

01:03:30.611 --> 01:03:33.344
To keep the level
of the conversation so low?

01:03:33.346 --> 01:03:35.481
Is it 'cause you're drunk?

01:05:03.373 --> 01:05:04.876
Here, I'll get it.

01:05:12.516 --> 01:05:15.953
Hey, brother.
What are you doing here?

01:05:18.422 --> 01:05:20.589
Hey, I've got some great
fucking news.

01:05:20.591 --> 01:05:24.562
I know where they are.
What do you say to that?

01:05:26.464 --> 01:05:29.134
- Did you hear me?
- Yes.

01:05:29.767 --> 01:05:33.538
And you don't even care?
What's wrong with you?

01:05:34.305 --> 01:05:36.973
You remember
what happened last night?

01:05:36.975 --> 01:05:38.942
Yes. And?

01:05:38.944 --> 01:05:42.645
- You remember that you hit me?
- I hit you?

01:05:42.647 --> 01:05:44.047
I hit you?

01:05:44.049 --> 01:05:48.418
Stop pretending and spare me
the "I don't remember" routine.

01:05:48.420 --> 01:05:50.487
You hit me in public, Charlie,

01:05:50.489 --> 01:05:53.925
so as sure as you're looking
at me right now, I'm leaving.

01:05:53.927 --> 01:05:55.762
No, wait. Wait, wait, wait.

01:05:57.362 --> 01:05:59.698
All right, what do you want?

01:06:00.300 --> 01:06:02.365
This is about slapping
each other in public?

01:06:02.367 --> 01:06:05.536
So I slap you,
you slap me back, we're even?

01:06:05.538 --> 01:06:07.839
So go ahead, hit me. Hit me.

01:06:12.979 --> 01:06:15.815
Jesus fucking Christ!

01:06:17.517 --> 01:06:20.087
What is your goddamn problem?

01:06:21.922 --> 01:06:24.056
I slapped you,
I didn't whack you in the head

01:06:24.058 --> 01:06:27.428
- with a fucking shovel!
- See? You do remember.

01:06:29.296 --> 01:06:31.564
I think I lost my hearing.

01:06:32.700 --> 01:06:35.167
This morning I woke up
in a whorehouse

01:06:35.169 --> 01:06:38.737
and I figured I might as well
stop by the claims office.

01:06:38.739 --> 01:06:41.207
So I went down
and I asked if there was

01:06:41.209 --> 01:06:44.776
a certain Hermann Kermit Warm
who'd recently staked a claim.

01:06:44.778 --> 01:06:46.213
Nothing.

01:06:46.714 --> 01:06:50.283
I was about to give up,
when boom, it hit me.

01:06:50.285 --> 01:06:54.020
I asked if there was anything
in the name of John Morris.

01:06:54.022 --> 01:06:57.757
And there it is:
American River, Folsom Lake.

01:06:57.759 --> 01:07:00.694
Bingo. Now we know
where they're heading.

01:07:46.743 --> 01:07:49.512
I'd like to see
how they go about it.

01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:52.446
Oh, another idea
for a career change?

01:07:52.448 --> 01:07:55.852
First selling shirts,
now prospecting?

01:07:56.520 --> 01:07:59.756
I'm gonna go on ahead,
you do as you please.

01:08:06.463 --> 01:08:09.131
Come on, Tub. Tub.

01:08:20.477 --> 01:08:23.113
Hey, come here.

01:08:33.459 --> 01:08:36.894
Hey. Folsom Lake?

01:08:37.328 --> 01:08:39.562
Folsom Lake!

01:08:39.564 --> 01:08:41.031
That-a-way.

01:08:41.033 --> 01:08:43.000
How far?

01:08:43.002 --> 01:08:45.004
About a day.

01:08:46.305 --> 01:08:48.241
We'll get them tomorrow.

01:08:50.243 --> 01:08:51.774
Come on, Tub.

01:08:59.752 --> 01:09:03.054
Come on, Tub.
Eat some grass.

01:09:04.691 --> 01:09:08.794
Oh, Tub, I'm sorry, my friend.

01:10:14.262 --> 01:10:15.929
You think it's them?

01:10:15.931 --> 01:10:20.203
Yes. They got here
faster than I thought.

01:10:34.451 --> 01:10:36.218
- What now?
- We kill them.

01:10:36.220 --> 01:10:38.153
- No, not that.
- Not what?

01:10:38.155 --> 01:10:39.955
This is no way
to kill people.

01:10:39.957 --> 01:10:42.457
We have to. Kill them,
bury them, no one finds them.

01:10:42.459 --> 01:10:44.959
By the time it dawns on the
Commodore, we'll be far gone.

01:10:44.961 --> 01:10:47.195
We don't work
for the Commodore anymore.

01:10:47.197 --> 01:10:50.031
Then what are you doing here?

01:10:50.033 --> 01:10:53.935
We... We don't work
for the Commodore anymore.

01:10:59.410 --> 01:11:01.678
And it just came out?

01:11:03.313 --> 01:11:04.681
Yeah.

01:11:05.450 --> 01:11:08.419
You said, "We don't work
for the Commodore any more."

01:11:09.587 --> 01:11:10.989
Yeah.

01:11:12.924 --> 01:11:17.395
You're a genius, Eli.
A goddamn genius.

01:11:18.496 --> 01:11:21.833
How did that even pop into your
head, just out of the blue?

01:11:23.636 --> 01:11:24.969
Hey, Morris.

01:11:26.539 --> 01:11:29.707
Morris. What are you
gonna do with us?

01:11:30.809 --> 01:11:33.075
Ask us to run
and shoot us like rabbits?

01:11:33.077 --> 01:11:35.980
Dump us in the forest?

01:11:37.016 --> 01:11:39.018
What are we going
to do about them?

01:11:40.886 --> 01:11:42.453
We leave them here.

01:11:42.455 --> 01:11:44.688
They'll end up killing each
other or getting eaten alive.

01:11:44.690 --> 01:11:46.056
I couldn't care less.

01:11:46.058 --> 01:11:47.525
We take the horses
and the mules,

01:11:47.527 --> 01:11:49.726
we extract what we can
from the river one last time,

01:11:49.728 --> 01:11:52.431
and then we leave here
without ever coming back.

01:11:55.168 --> 01:11:58.303
All right. Um, and leave
all our gear behind?

01:11:58.305 --> 01:12:01.506
We travel light, ride up
to Sacramento, buy more gear

01:12:01.508 --> 01:12:03.241
and ride up the river
from there.

01:12:03.243 --> 01:12:05.245
Anyone there?

01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:11.584
I said, anyone there?
Can you hear me?

01:12:11.586 --> 01:12:14.154
Yes, what do you want?

01:12:14.988 --> 01:12:17.323
We're working
the river downstream.

01:12:17.325 --> 01:12:21.926
We're running out of supplies.
You've got any for sale?

01:12:21.928 --> 01:12:24.630
We'll pay you
San Francisco prices.

01:12:24.632 --> 01:12:26.699
They don't look
like prospectors.

01:12:26.701 --> 01:12:28.000
They're not prospectors.

01:12:28.002 --> 01:12:29.635
I didn't hear
your answer.

01:12:29.637 --> 01:12:31.403
'Cause I didn't give one.

01:12:31.405 --> 01:12:32.905
Don't take a step closer.

01:12:32.907 --> 01:12:35.475
Hermann, we have to fight.
Is your gun loaded?

01:12:35.477 --> 01:12:36.675
Yes, I think so.

01:12:36.677 --> 01:12:38.346
Well, take it out,
God damn it.

01:12:40.314 --> 01:12:43.516
I told you not to move
and I won't tell you again.

01:12:43.518 --> 01:12:45.454
We have nothing to sell.

01:12:46.754 --> 01:12:49.756
Go back to where you came from!

01:12:49.758 --> 01:12:52.157
Go to hell!

01:12:52.159 --> 01:12:57.397
Hey, Morris. Hey.
Hey, don't leave us here.

01:12:57.399 --> 01:12:58.698
Morris!

01:12:58.700 --> 01:13:01.303
John, look out.

01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:06.340
- Hermann! Hermann!
- I'm all right.

01:13:06.342 --> 01:13:07.375
I'm all right.

01:13:07.377 --> 01:13:09.976
Let us help you.
Let us help you!

01:13:09.978 --> 01:13:12.212
Give us the keys,
you fucking idiots.

01:13:12.214 --> 01:13:14.715
You don't stand
a fucking chance, come on.

01:13:14.717 --> 01:13:17.118
John, we're badly outnumbered.

01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:19.455
Are you waiting
for us all to get killed?

01:13:26.862 --> 01:13:29.198
Over there!

01:13:33.970 --> 01:13:35.970
Damn you!

01:13:35.972 --> 01:13:37.739
Fuck.

01:13:39.376 --> 01:13:41.144
Oh, man!

01:13:43.580 --> 01:13:45.880
You think it's Mayfield's
raccoons?

01:13:45.882 --> 01:13:47.184
Sure looks like 'em.

01:13:48.085 --> 01:13:50.085
Hey, guys!

01:13:50.087 --> 01:13:54.357
Before things sour,
we've got some news for you.

01:13:54.359 --> 01:13:55.425
Mayfield is dead.

01:13:55.427 --> 01:13:57.392
Fuck!

01:13:57.394 --> 01:14:01.363
You'll never get paid. Do you
really think this is worth it?

01:14:03.468 --> 01:14:06.469
As long as you can see us,
you shoot at them like crazy.

01:14:06.471 --> 01:14:07.805
We make it to the other side

01:14:07.807 --> 01:14:11.307
and you can't see us anymore,
stop shooting.

01:14:11.309 --> 01:14:13.278
- Get it?
- Yep.

01:14:13.611 --> 01:14:15.010
- Ready?
- Yeah.

01:14:15.012 --> 01:14:16.247
Go.

01:14:35.634 --> 01:14:37.503
Son of a bitch!

01:14:56.757 --> 01:14:58.556
Our Father, who art in heaven,

01:14:58.558 --> 01:15:00.792
hallowed be Thy name...

01:15:00.794 --> 01:15:02.861
What are you talking about?

01:15:04.798 --> 01:15:06.798
- Charlie?
- Huh?

01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:08.635
- Charlie?
- Yeah.

01:15:43.605 --> 01:15:46.973
If Morris agrees to it,
here is what I suggest.

01:15:46.975 --> 01:15:50.142
You two keep half of what
you pull from the river,

01:15:50.144 --> 01:15:52.714
with the remaining half
going to the company.

01:15:53.215 --> 01:15:56.183
The company being you
and Morris?

01:15:56.185 --> 01:15:58.385
Uh, yes.
Well, no, no, not quite.

01:15:58.387 --> 01:16:00.755
The company
is our phalanstery project.

01:16:00.757 --> 01:16:02.224
Phalan-what?

01:16:03.559 --> 01:16:05.160
Phalanstery.

01:16:07.029 --> 01:16:09.732
It's a community
we're founding, in Texas.

01:16:10.165 --> 01:16:12.165
An ideal living space,
ruled by the laws

01:16:12.167 --> 01:16:14.735
of true democracy and sharing.

01:16:16.072 --> 01:16:18.007
Whatever you say.

01:16:18.642 --> 01:16:22.443
- Does something bother you?
- Oh... That's your business.

01:16:22.445 --> 01:16:24.812
Then we're agreed,
half of what you extract?

01:16:24.814 --> 01:16:28.418
Fine with me.

01:16:28.985 --> 01:16:30.786
I'm with him.

01:16:30.788 --> 01:16:32.523
Excellent. John?

01:16:33.390 --> 01:16:35.224
Don't ask my opinion, Hermann.

01:16:35.226 --> 01:16:37.862
You know I don't agree
with what's going on here.

01:16:38.294 --> 01:16:42.096
I'm still in, of course,
but I remain on my guard.

01:16:42.098 --> 01:16:44.635
Why won't you look at me
when you say that?

01:16:45.803 --> 01:16:46.970
Look at me,
you son of a bitch.

01:16:46.972 --> 01:16:48.170
Gentlemen.

01:16:48.172 --> 01:16:49.906
I am looking at you,
Charlie Sisters.

01:16:49.908 --> 01:16:51.373
Do you want me
to tell you what I see?

01:16:51.375 --> 01:16:55.312
That's quite enough,
please. Please?

01:16:57.749 --> 01:16:58.948
I'm going to sleep.

01:16:58.950 --> 01:17:00.349
Do your legs still hurt?

01:17:00.351 --> 01:17:02.687
I'm all right.
Good night, Hermann.

01:17:03.121 --> 01:17:04.556
Good night.

01:17:05.824 --> 01:17:07.458
He's gonna have to change.

01:17:11.496 --> 01:17:13.765
He doesn't trust you,
and you can't blame him.

01:17:16.268 --> 01:17:19.605
He will change.
We'll all change.

01:17:21.908 --> 01:17:23.475
We don't have any other choice.

01:17:38.124 --> 01:17:39.456
It's the formula.

01:17:39.458 --> 01:17:42.293
It's, uh... very caustic
in its purest form.

01:17:42.295 --> 01:17:44.728
I thought diluting it would
make it harmless. I was wrong.

01:17:44.730 --> 01:17:47.701
Next time we'll have to
grease up our skins beforehand.

01:17:48.401 --> 01:17:50.537
So you... you prospected
already?

01:17:50.871 --> 01:17:52.372
Two days ago.

01:17:52.973 --> 01:17:55.207
Did it work?

01:17:57.476 --> 01:18:00.480
Better than I had ever imagined.

01:18:58.273 --> 01:19:01.744
Come on, Tub! Come on!

01:20:12.951 --> 01:20:15.953
If you look at the back
of a horse long enough,

01:20:15.955 --> 01:20:17.188
you get caught.

01:20:19.191 --> 01:20:20.790
What are you doing?

01:20:20.792 --> 01:20:22.859
What?

01:20:22.861 --> 01:20:24.629
We can't sleep.

01:20:25.131 --> 01:20:26.897
What's the point of me
standing guard

01:20:26.899 --> 01:20:28.432
if you all don't go to sleep?

01:20:28.434 --> 01:20:30.801
Charlie, come down
and join us. It'll do you good.

01:20:30.803 --> 01:20:34.039
Come on.
Come on, there's no point.

01:20:34.041 --> 01:20:36.642
We're not going to sleep.

01:20:56.362 --> 01:20:57.696
Do you really believe

01:20:57.698 --> 01:21:01.468
in that old two-bit
ideal society nonsense?

01:21:02.237 --> 01:21:04.038
What do you want me to say?

01:21:05.006 --> 01:21:06.340
I don't know...

01:21:06.875 --> 01:21:08.907
but I'd say a guy
with a little bit of smarts

01:21:08.909 --> 01:21:12.145
has to realize that it sounds
like solid-gold bullshit.

01:21:12.147 --> 01:21:14.147
Why do you think I'm here?

01:21:14.149 --> 01:21:16.481
Like us. For the gold.

01:21:16.483 --> 01:21:19.053
Well, sure, for the gold.

01:21:19.888 --> 01:21:22.122
What will you do with it?

01:21:22.124 --> 01:21:23.455
Spend it, obviously.

01:21:23.457 --> 01:21:25.691
You really think
you'll have time to?

01:21:25.693 --> 01:21:27.527
With all the corpses
you've left behind,

01:21:27.529 --> 01:21:29.864
the Commodore,
your famous drunkenness?

01:21:30.298 --> 01:21:31.831
Your pockets are full to boot.

01:21:31.833 --> 01:21:34.300
Something tells me you won't
be living to a ripe old age.

01:21:34.302 --> 01:21:36.502
And would your ideal society
make a difference?

01:21:36.504 --> 01:21:41.810
Well, I can't say for you.
But for me, yes.

01:21:44.213 --> 01:21:47.082
Or it's a scam.

01:21:48.150 --> 01:21:49.852
A trap for suckers.

01:21:51.053 --> 01:21:52.786
Is that it?

01:21:54.356 --> 01:21:56.223
Let me tell you something,
John Morris.

01:21:56.225 --> 01:21:58.358
You are one goddamn arrogant
asshole.

01:21:58.360 --> 01:22:00.761
Let me tell you
something, Charlie Sisters.

01:22:00.763 --> 01:22:05.001
I don't care what you think.
That is to say if you think.

01:22:23.254 --> 01:22:24.856
Shit.

01:22:39.036 --> 01:22:40.605
Tub!

01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:44.574
Tub?

01:22:46.043 --> 01:22:47.678
Tub?

01:23:02.995 --> 01:23:04.428
Tub?

01:23:12.071 --> 01:23:13.740
Eli.

01:23:14.774 --> 01:23:16.808
What are you doing down here?

01:23:17.242 --> 01:23:18.877
Nothing much.

01:23:19.411 --> 01:23:20.744
I'm headed up to the dam.

01:23:20.746 --> 01:23:22.714
Going to see
if the water's settled.

01:23:26.252 --> 01:23:27.551
You see that?

01:23:27.553 --> 01:23:30.688
Yeah. I get the impression
Charlie's changing.

01:23:30.690 --> 01:23:31.956
Hmm.

01:23:31.958 --> 01:23:35.762
Oh, you mean he's not going
to try and kill us anymore?

01:23:38.564 --> 01:23:39.830
It's a little strange,

01:23:39.832 --> 01:23:42.036
me talking to you about this,
isn't it?

01:23:44.171 --> 01:23:46.740
It's better,
facing up to things.

01:23:48.808 --> 01:23:53.378
You know,
I once asked John Morris

01:23:53.380 --> 01:23:55.714
how he ended up working
for the Commodore.

01:23:55.716 --> 01:23:57.983
And he said something
along the lines of,

01:23:57.985 --> 01:24:00.552
he wanted to break
free from his family,

01:24:00.554 --> 01:24:02.422
wanted to seek
a sense of adventure.

01:24:02.424 --> 01:24:04.858
And I thought, those reasons
are honest enough.

01:24:08.062 --> 01:24:10.898
How about you?
How did you end up here?

01:24:12.133 --> 01:24:13.600
Eh...

01:24:14.269 --> 01:24:16.135
Does my question upset you?

01:24:16.137 --> 01:24:19.807
No. No, it's just a long story.

01:24:22.743 --> 01:24:25.113
Charlie was always violent.

01:24:25.714 --> 01:24:29.851
And when he got in a fight,
it usually ended badly.

01:24:31.053 --> 01:24:32.585
And when you kill a man,

01:24:32.587 --> 01:24:34.722
you end up with his father
or his brother

01:24:34.724 --> 01:24:36.089
or his friends on your tail,

01:24:36.091 --> 01:24:38.660
and you have to start
all over again.

01:24:39.728 --> 01:24:44.700
One thing leads to another...
and I had to help him.

01:24:46.302 --> 01:24:48.037
He's my brother.

01:24:55.244 --> 01:24:57.046
You all right?

01:24:58.315 --> 01:24:59.849
Sit down.

01:25:02.252 --> 01:25:05.856
I... I don't know.
I don't know.

01:25:07.189 --> 01:25:09.857
It's, uh... probably the heat.

01:25:09.859 --> 01:25:12.095
Sit here for a moment.
It'll pass.

01:25:14.031 --> 01:25:15.799
I'm sorry.

01:25:19.603 --> 01:25:21.671
I lost my horse.

01:25:24.041 --> 01:25:25.842
He died, I mean.

01:25:27.478 --> 01:25:29.080
Tub's dead.

01:25:32.417 --> 01:25:34.619
He was a middling horse, but...

01:25:36.522 --> 01:25:40.091
Just didn't expect it
to affect me like this.

01:25:45.497 --> 01:25:47.832
When we were kids...

01:25:49.368 --> 01:25:52.071
...Charlie killed our father.

01:25:58.009 --> 01:26:01.679
And I'm the older one.
It should have been me.

01:26:11.156 --> 01:26:12.791
Do you regret that?

01:26:15.194 --> 01:26:16.795
Yes.

01:26:21.034 --> 01:26:24.204
'Cause after that,
Charlie was never the same.

01:26:32.879 --> 01:26:35.414
It was a very pleasant day,
wasn't it?

01:26:35.416 --> 01:26:36.950
Hmm.

01:26:39.819 --> 01:26:41.889
You get on well with Warm?

01:26:44.290 --> 01:26:46.259
And you with Morris?

01:26:50.297 --> 01:26:51.799
What did you talk about?

01:26:54.001 --> 01:26:55.836
Um...

01:26:56.304 --> 01:27:01.140
About us, about the Commodore.

01:27:04.245 --> 01:27:05.413
About Pa.

01:27:08.682 --> 01:27:10.986
He's an easy man to talk to.

01:27:12.954 --> 01:27:14.389
You know...

01:27:15.122 --> 01:27:17.225
I've been thinking about
something.

01:27:18.093 --> 01:27:20.126
What do you think the Commodore
is gonna do

01:27:20.128 --> 01:27:22.831
when he realizes
we're not coming back?

01:27:23.431 --> 01:27:25.434
He'll send men after us.

01:27:26.636 --> 01:27:28.703
We'll have to get rid of 'em.

01:27:29.972 --> 01:27:31.971
And the ones after that,

01:27:31.973 --> 01:27:34.276
and all the ones he sends
on our trail.

01:27:36.077 --> 01:27:38.181
And to think you wanted to stop.

01:27:39.549 --> 01:27:42.151
We've got a season of blood
ahead of us.

01:27:44.287 --> 01:27:47.856
Then, sooner or later,
to put an end to it...

01:27:48.790 --> 01:27:51.194
...we'll have to kill
the Commodore.

01:27:58.734 --> 01:28:00.137
And after that?

01:28:07.511 --> 01:28:09.479
You're gonna take his place?

01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:18.122
Charlie?

01:28:20.157 --> 01:28:22.826
Are you gonna take
the Commodore's place?

01:28:32.270 --> 01:28:34.473
How long have you been
thinking about it?

01:30:02.063 --> 01:30:05.665
Once you've emptied
the solution...

01:30:05.667 --> 01:30:08.702
Morris and I will agitate
the water

01:30:08.704 --> 01:30:10.403
to increase the field
of illumination.

01:30:10.405 --> 01:30:14.374
Now once the formula starts
to activate,

01:30:14.376 --> 01:30:16.411
grab your buckets and get to
work.

01:30:17.112 --> 01:30:19.614
Not a moment to lose.
Ready, John?

01:30:20.515 --> 01:30:21.950
- Ready.
- Ready.

01:30:51.247 --> 01:30:53.116
And stop.

01:31:03.025 --> 01:31:04.661
What's going on, Warm?

01:31:05.763 --> 01:31:07.331
Just wait.

01:31:20.310 --> 01:31:22.745
There, there!

01:31:22.747 --> 01:31:24.480
Look!

01:31:24.482 --> 01:31:26.651
Yes!

01:31:55.181 --> 01:31:56.747
Gentlemen, remember.

01:31:56.749 --> 01:32:00.720
If you start to feel the burn,
take a moment and wash off.

01:32:42.563 --> 01:32:44.332
Careful, careful.

01:32:47.001 --> 01:32:49.101
Charlie, come wash off.

01:32:49.103 --> 01:32:50.437
- Come on.
- Wait.

01:32:52.339 --> 01:32:53.774
Here.

01:33:02.049 --> 01:33:05.118
It's going away.
It's going away.

01:33:05.120 --> 01:33:07.219
- What was that?
- What?

01:33:07.221 --> 01:33:09.923
- It's going away.
- It's going away.

01:33:40.122 --> 01:33:42.823
What are you doing?
Charlie, what are you doing?

01:33:42.825 --> 01:33:44.458
We have to throw it all in!

01:33:44.460 --> 01:33:46.427
No, Charlie. Charlie!

01:33:46.429 --> 01:33:48.529
Put that down!

01:33:48.531 --> 01:33:50.933
- John!
- Charlie, you damn fool!

01:33:50.935 --> 01:33:52.634
John!

01:33:52.636 --> 01:33:54.435
- Hermann, no!
- John!

01:33:54.437 --> 01:33:58.539
Charlie!

01:33:58.541 --> 01:34:03.245
John! John! Close your eyes.

01:34:03.247 --> 01:34:05.814
Come on,
we're gonna wash it off!

01:34:09.186 --> 01:34:11.655
Charlie!

01:34:36.247 --> 01:34:37.883
Charlie?

01:34:41.621 --> 01:34:43.421
Charlie?

01:34:48.894 --> 01:34:50.295
Help.

01:34:52.365 --> 01:34:54.200
Help.

01:34:56.602 --> 01:34:58.203
Help me.

01:35:18.959 --> 01:35:20.761
Help me.

01:35:23.530 --> 01:35:24.798
Help me.

01:35:33.206 --> 01:35:34.641
Hermann?

01:35:35.442 --> 01:35:38.512
- Huh?
- Can I do something for you?

01:35:40.581 --> 01:35:42.215
Morris.

01:35:43.017 --> 01:35:45.520
Is that you, Morris?

01:35:50.091 --> 01:35:52.293
Yes, it's me.

01:35:54.328 --> 01:35:57.700
Oh, John,
where did you disappear to?

01:35:59.034 --> 01:36:01.737
I was out getting some firewood.

01:36:25.895 --> 01:36:26.996
Oh, John.

01:36:29.766 --> 01:36:32.635
I feel I've known you
a long time.

01:36:33.536 --> 01:36:36.005
I'm sorry you died before me.

01:36:38.041 --> 01:36:41.711
I... I wanted to help you.

01:36:44.848 --> 01:36:47.417
I wanted to be your friend.

01:36:50.386 --> 01:36:52.856
You are my friend, Hermann.

01:37:13.677 --> 01:37:15.312
Thank you.

01:39:03.192 --> 01:39:04.657
<i>I must confess</i>

01:39:04.659 --> 01:39:07.160
<i>that the very happiest moments
of my life</i>

01:39:07.162 --> 01:39:10.998
<i>have been spent in the
wilderness of the far west</i>

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:16.236
<i>with the plentiful supply
of dry pine logs on the fire.</i>

01:39:16.238 --> 01:39:17.973
<i>I would not...</i>

01:39:18.507 --> 01:39:21.008
<i>I would sit cross legged,</i>

01:39:21.010 --> 01:39:24.112
<i>enjoying the genial warmth,</i>

01:39:24.114 --> 01:39:28.485
<i>and watch the blue smoke
as it curled upwards.</i>

01:39:29.619 --> 01:39:35.356
<i>Scarcely did I ever wish
to change such hours of freedom</i>

01:39:35.358 --> 01:39:38.595
<i>for all the luxuries of
civilized life.</i>

01:39:55.112 --> 01:39:56.781
Tighter.

01:40:55.308 --> 01:40:57.375
What are you doing here?

01:40:57.377 --> 01:41:00.980
Sir, there are some men...

01:41:01.581 --> 01:41:04.648
Tell them to wait here.

01:41:06.552 --> 01:41:10.123
Sir, there are men
out there asking about you.

01:41:12.092 --> 01:41:13.691
Wha... what men?

01:41:13.693 --> 01:41:16.130
In the street, three of 'em.

01:41:32.414 --> 01:41:34.447
Rex. Shit!

01:41:34.449 --> 01:41:36.416
Eli?

01:41:36.418 --> 01:41:38.285
Yes!

01:41:38.685 --> 01:41:41.320
Is it true
Charlie's out of the game?

01:41:41.322 --> 01:41:45.158
- What do you want?
- Me? Nothing.

01:41:45.160 --> 01:41:46.659
The Commodore sent me.

01:41:46.661 --> 01:41:48.594
- Is there a back door?
- Yeah.

01:41:48.596 --> 01:41:50.431
He's growing impatient.

01:41:50.433 --> 01:41:53.002
All right, go, go, go, go, go.

01:41:53.202 --> 01:41:55.334
Charlie, Charlie, get up.
We gotta go.

01:41:55.336 --> 01:41:57.136
- No.
- Yeah, come on!

01:41:57.138 --> 01:41:59.939
Come on out
so we can talk about it.

01:41:59.941 --> 01:42:01.277
No.

01:42:02.111 --> 01:42:03.611
All right.

01:42:06.516 --> 01:42:08.717
Hey, did you hear me?

01:42:10.618 --> 01:42:12.855
Yeah, I'm coming.

01:42:14.023 --> 01:42:15.825
Get out of here.

01:42:25.502 --> 01:42:26.836
Shit.

01:42:27.069 --> 01:42:29.372
Do I have to come in
and get you?

01:42:30.207 --> 01:42:32.075
I'm coming out!

01:42:34.644 --> 01:42:36.010
First you toss your guns

01:42:36.012 --> 01:42:38.815
and come out
with your hands up. Good.

01:43:04.242 --> 01:43:05.508
God damn.

01:43:05.510 --> 01:43:08.179
Fucking bastard.

01:43:14.886 --> 01:43:17.054
Are there others behind you?

01:43:53.793 --> 01:43:57.462
Stop it, stop.
Just give me...

01:43:57.464 --> 01:43:59.864
Come on. Let's go.

01:44:26.126 --> 01:44:28.760
Come on, Charlie.

01:44:28.762 --> 01:44:32.200
Go hide the horses.
Go on, go hide the horses!

01:44:35.970 --> 01:44:38.705
Shh!

01:44:40.375 --> 01:44:43.044
Shh! Shh!

01:44:43.578 --> 01:44:47.780
Shh! Come on.
Come on, come on.

01:44:47.782 --> 01:44:52.320
Shh! Shh!

01:45:18.114 --> 01:45:21.550
Hold still, Charlie.

01:45:31.862 --> 01:45:33.897
You want some of this?

01:45:36.734 --> 01:45:42.205
Rex and Sanchez and those
other guys we didn't even know.

01:45:44.074 --> 01:45:45.708
You really think it's a good
idea

01:45:45.710 --> 01:45:47.842
to go back up north?

01:45:47.844 --> 01:45:50.479
Well, you know very well
why we're going north.

01:45:50.481 --> 01:45:53.251
And you know
what we still have left to do.

01:45:56.253 --> 01:45:58.955
I lost the hand
that I work with.

01:46:01.659 --> 01:46:03.928
You'll be on your own on this.

01:46:10.001 --> 01:46:12.070
Are you ashamed of me?

01:46:17.509 --> 01:46:19.378
Do you mean what you're saying?

01:46:23.115 --> 01:46:25.117
Things have changed so much.

01:46:33.158 --> 01:46:34.826
In a week,
we'll be in Oregon City

01:46:34.828 --> 01:46:36.463
and I'll kill the Commodore.

01:47:21.976 --> 01:47:25.110
Hey, have you noticed
how long it's been

01:47:25.112 --> 01:47:26.981
since anyone tried to kill us?

01:47:27.849 --> 01:47:30.951
I don't know.
Three or four days?

01:47:31.986 --> 01:47:34.021
Don't you find that strange?

01:47:36.190 --> 01:47:37.325
Come on.

01:47:50.272 --> 01:47:52.238
You walk in the front door.

01:47:52.240 --> 01:47:55.409
Take the staircase on
the right, go up, make a left.

01:47:55.411 --> 01:47:57.979
His office is the second door
on the left.

01:47:58.414 --> 01:48:00.581
How many guys are up there
with him usually?

01:48:00.583 --> 01:48:03.719
Usually there's a guy sitting
right outside the office.

01:48:04.420 --> 01:48:07.523
And one in the room
farther down.

01:49:02.615 --> 01:49:04.249
Your remembrances.

01:49:28.707 --> 01:49:30.109
Fuck!

01:49:32.111 --> 01:49:34.347
You must be disappointed.

01:49:36.816 --> 01:49:40.319
Yeah, kinda.

01:49:43.623 --> 01:49:46.991
Sir? I think no one else
may be coming.

01:49:48.328 --> 01:49:50.430
May we close the casket?

01:49:56.603 --> 01:49:58.305
Sure.

01:50:04.679 --> 01:50:06.113
Hold on.

01:50:22.163 --> 01:50:24.265
Sir, please!

01:50:25.700 --> 01:50:27.435
Just making sure.

01:50:38.413 --> 01:50:40.347
Think she's changed a lot?

01:50:40.349 --> 01:50:42.517
Not as much as us.

01:50:45.921 --> 01:50:47.789
Check this out.

01:51:01.638 --> 01:51:03.339
Whoa!

01:51:04.107 --> 01:51:08.142
Hey, if you come any closer,
I'll shoot you!

01:51:08.144 --> 01:51:10.177
It's us, Ma.

01:51:10.179 --> 01:51:13.850
It's your sons.
It's Charlie and Eli.

01:51:15.051 --> 01:51:16.686
My sons?

01:51:17.787 --> 01:51:20.421
Oh, my God!
Well, why, why did you come...

01:51:20.423 --> 01:51:22.258
Why did you come back?

01:51:23.394 --> 01:51:25.462
To see you, Ma.

01:51:26.797 --> 01:51:30.264
If you came here to hide
or to run away from something,

01:51:30.266 --> 01:51:33.635
you just turn around.
I don't wanna see ya.

01:51:33.637 --> 01:51:36.571
No, we're just tired, Ma.
We just want to come home.

01:51:36.573 --> 01:51:40.577
We just came here
to see you. I swear.

01:51:43.815 --> 01:51:45.349
Please?

01:51:56.028 --> 01:51:57.729
You smell bad.

01:52:01.166 --> 01:52:03.768
I see you're missing something.

01:52:04.335 --> 01:52:06.504
Talk about that later.

01:52:35.234 --> 01:52:36.769
Coffee?

01:52:39.773 --> 01:52:41.273
Thank you.

01:53:07.001 --> 01:53:09.103
You know, uh...

01:53:09.871 --> 01:53:12.807
I wasn't expecting you,
I guess you know that.

01:53:14.475 --> 01:53:16.477
You, you know that?

01:53:17.278 --> 01:53:19.746
Oh, it's hot.

01:53:19.748 --> 01:53:21.348
Too hot?

01:53:22.083 --> 01:53:23.415
Too hot?

01:53:23.417 --> 01:53:25.720
No, it's good, yeah.
