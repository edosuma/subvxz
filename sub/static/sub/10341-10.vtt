WEBVTT

02:02.497 --> 02:04.915
Sarah.

02:05.083 --> 02:07.793
I'd like you to take this.

02:11.714 --> 02:13.590
Doc,

02:13.758 --> 02:18.137
I don't want it.

02:18.304 --> 02:20.430
I wanna be there.

02:20.598 --> 02:23.725
Every part of me needs to be there.

02:23.893 --> 02:25.936
For both of them.

02:27.814 --> 02:30.858
Today I bury my husband.

02:31.693 --> 02:34.486
Next to my only child.

02:36.114 --> 02:38.574
Her grave is still so...

02:38.741 --> 02:42.619
...new. There's only
a little bit of grass on it.

02:46.207 --> 02:51.336
Mrs. Palmer, there are things
dark and heinous in this world.

02:51.504 --> 02:54.298
Things too horrible
to tell our children.

02:55.383 --> 02:58.010
Your husband fell victim
to one of these long ago,

02:58.178 --> 03:01.638
when he was innocent and trusting.

03:01.806 --> 03:05.517
Leland did not do these things.
Not the Leland that you knew.

03:05.685 --> 03:07.269
No.

03:07.437 --> 03:10.063
That man I saw.

03:11.274 --> 03:15.736
Long, dirty, disgusting hair.

03:15.904 --> 03:18.822
He's gone. Forever.

03:22.660 --> 03:25.495
So is everything I loved.

03:26.873 --> 03:28.749
Sarah.

03:29.542 --> 03:34.630
I think it might help to tell you what
happened just before Leland died.

03:36.382 --> 03:41.136
It's hard to realize here and here

03:41.304 --> 03:44.181
what has transpired.

03:44.349 --> 03:50.020
Your husband went so far as
to drug you to keep his actions secret.

03:50.188 --> 03:51.980
But before he died,

03:52.148 --> 03:56.318
Leland confronted the horror
of what he had done to Laura

03:56.486 --> 04:00.322
and agonized over the pain
he had caused you.

04:01.866 --> 04:04.660
Leland died at peace.

04:05.828 --> 04:09.957
In his last moments, he saw Laura.

04:10.124 --> 04:12.834
He kept saying
how much he loved her.

04:13.002 --> 04:16.004
And I believe she welcomed him,

04:16.172 --> 04:18.632
that she forgave him.

04:23.888 --> 04:25.097
It's time.

04:41.447 --> 04:44.658
Mrs. Palmer, I would be honored
to drive you.

04:53.251 --> 04:56.920
Leland always found
the other earring.

06:25.426 --> 06:28.637
- I don't know about you...
- Excuse me.

06:28.805 --> 06:33.392
Get some of this Waldorf salad here.
There we go.

06:33.559 --> 06:36.937
- Nice to see you too.
- Yeah.

06:50.993 --> 06:53.120
I got this for Sarah.

06:58.334 --> 07:00.335
Here you go.

07:00.503 --> 07:04.131
- While it's hot.
- Oh, thank you very much.

07:04.298 --> 07:05.757
Mm-hm.

07:09.512 --> 07:13.014
Do they invite people to these things,
or do they just show up?

07:14.267 --> 07:17.227
At a time like this,
people just naturally come together.

07:17.395 --> 07:20.480
It's a time of reaching out.

07:20.648 --> 07:23.483
I remember when my mother died,

07:23.651 --> 07:26.111
there must have been
a hundred people.

07:31.868 --> 07:34.953
Seems like the whole town
is falling apart.

07:36.080 --> 07:39.291
Somehow James thinks it's his fault.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.960
First Laura, then Maddy.

07:42.128 --> 07:45.338
Maybe he blames me, I don't know.

07:45.506 --> 07:48.758
Two people in love couldn't have
caused all this, could they?

07:48.926 --> 07:51.136
Oh, honey.

07:51.929 --> 07:54.055
He'll come back.

07:54.724 --> 07:57.100
Everything's gonna get better.

08:03.733 --> 08:05.942
- Welcome home, Dr. Jacoby.
- Major.

08:06.277 --> 08:09.446
You appear to be fully recovered
from your recent setback.

08:09.614 --> 08:14.284
Well, nothing beats the restorative
powers of Hanalei Bay.

08:15.244 --> 08:17.621
- Sheriff, how are you?
- Major.

08:18.122 --> 08:19.581
What's the matter?

08:19.749 --> 08:21.082
Doesn't she feed you?

08:24.712 --> 08:28.715
- You're just jealous.
- Jealous?

08:28.883 --> 08:34.012
Oh, I... I... I wouldn't... I wouldn't
spend my time changing diapers.

08:34.388 --> 08:36.139
What's next for you, sir?

08:36.474 --> 08:38.767
Well, major, I'm not exactly sure.

08:38.935 --> 08:41.603
I've stockpiled a few weeks
of vacation time.

08:41.771 --> 08:44.481
Now might be the time
to cash them in.

08:44.649 --> 08:46.566
For starters,
would you care to join me

08:46.734 --> 08:50.445
for an incredibly pleasant evening
of night fishing?

08:51.364 --> 08:52.447
Aces.

08:52.657 --> 08:54.199
Eddie,

08:54.367 --> 08:59.496
can you see my underpants
in my shoes?

09:01.707 --> 09:05.752
I looked down and I thought
I could see the reflection.

09:08.589 --> 09:12.342
Do you think boys
are looking up my dress?

09:13.970 --> 09:16.721
Sweetheart, I can't see a thing
in your shoes.

09:16.931 --> 09:18.932
I promise.

09:19.809 --> 09:21.351
Okay.

09:28.776 --> 09:31.820
Donna came over to see Laura.

09:31.988 --> 09:34.489
Do you know what they did?

09:34.657 --> 09:37.742
It was late. We'd made popcorn.

09:37.910 --> 09:43.290
And they made this very serious
promise to each other,

09:43.457 --> 09:46.001
to be best friends forever.

09:47.211 --> 09:50.046
I... I think it was a kind of bond

09:50.214 --> 09:51.881
against...

09:52.049 --> 09:53.800
Dying.

09:57.722 --> 10:00.557
I need to remember all this.

10:01.809 --> 10:05.186
Besides, she's cursed.

10:08.649 --> 10:11.526
Aah! Oh! Aah! Aah!

10:11.694 --> 10:14.070
Boys, take it easy.
Take it easy. Come on.

10:14.238 --> 10:17.699
I'm gonna stick his head in the gutter
where it belongs.

10:20.077 --> 10:23.496
Dwayne, now knock it off.
Knock it off.

10:23.664 --> 10:26.583
Remember where you are
and why we're here.

10:26.751 --> 10:28.376
Please.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.759
They seem to be having fun.

10:38.804 --> 10:40.889
The mayor and his brother.

10:41.057 --> 10:43.183
Dougie owns the newspaper.

10:43.351 --> 10:46.978
They've had a running feud
going for 50 years.

10:47.146 --> 10:48.480
Nobody knows how it started.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.940
Something about an old flame
and a rumble seat.

10:51.108 --> 10:53.193
I don't even think
they remember anymore.

10:53.361 --> 10:55.737
Well, the nest's a little stirred up
right now.

10:55.905 --> 11:00.033
Dougie's engaged to be married
to a babe.

11:00.201 --> 11:06.081
- For the fifth time.
- She's still in her teens, he's 110.

11:06.248 --> 11:10.460
One of those January-December
sort of deals.

11:10.628 --> 11:14.130
You remember the first time Dwayne
ran for mayor? When was that?

11:14.965 --> 11:19.678
Oh, um... Sixty-two? Yeah, 1962.

11:20.096 --> 11:23.056
Dougie wrote an editorial,
came out against Dwayne.

11:23.224 --> 11:25.350
And Dwayne was
running unopposed.

11:28.521 --> 11:31.356
Harry, I'm really gonna miss
this place.

11:40.491 --> 11:44.202
You're asking me to admit
a 35-year-old woman

11:44.370 --> 11:46.037
to the senior class.

11:46.872 --> 11:48.915
You got me there.

11:49.083 --> 11:52.001
Eddie, how much longer?
Class is starting.

11:52.169 --> 11:54.963
We'll be right out, Nadine.
Just a few more minutes.

11:55.131 --> 11:58.216
Guess what.
Cheerleading tryouts today.

11:58.384 --> 12:00.385
I just saw a notice
on the bulletin board.

12:00.553 --> 12:03.888
That's great, honey. Um...

12:04.557 --> 12:07.058
Why don't you go
practice your splits?

12:07.226 --> 12:08.601
Okay.

12:24.285 --> 12:25.952
Bellman?

12:27.955 --> 12:29.956
Customer relations.

12:30.124 --> 12:33.460
Has everything been satisfactory
during your stay with us, Mr. Cooper?

12:33.919 --> 12:36.087
Audrey, I have no complaints.

12:37.840 --> 12:41.551
- When are you leaving?
- Going fishing.

12:42.553 --> 12:44.012
But you are leaving.

12:45.639 --> 12:47.974
Yes, in effect I am.

12:54.648 --> 12:58.151
So this is it? You save my life,
then break my heart?

12:59.361 --> 13:02.280
Audrey, I've explained to you
my personal policy about involving...

13:02.448 --> 13:05.283
Yeah, I know, I know.
I'm a teenager.

13:05.451 --> 13:07.619
And you were involved
in a case I was working on.

13:16.045 --> 13:18.755
Someone must have hurt you once
really badly.

13:21.759 --> 13:24.928
No. Someone was hurt by me.

13:25.304 --> 13:27.639
And I will never let that
happen again.

13:30.434 --> 13:32.894
What happened,
did she die or something?

13:33.354 --> 13:35.480
As a matter of fact, she did.

13:35.648 --> 13:36.940
You wanna know how?

13:42.613 --> 13:46.574
She was a material witness
to a federal crime.

13:46.742 --> 13:48.618
We were supposed to protect her.

13:48.786 --> 13:50.954
Twenty-four hours a day.

13:51.747 --> 13:53.706
My partner and I.

13:54.250 --> 13:56.626
Windom Earle was his name.

13:57.378 --> 13:59.921
He taught me everything I know
about being a special agent.

14:01.340 --> 14:04.759
And when the attempt on her life
was finally made,

14:05.427 --> 14:07.262
I wasn't ready.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.764
Because I loved her.

14:12.893 --> 14:15.061
She died in my arms.

14:18.983 --> 14:21.359
I was badly injured,

14:21.527 --> 14:23.695
and my partner lost his mind.

14:26.198 --> 14:27.866
Need to hear any more?

14:33.122 --> 14:36.958
Audrey, I like you
and I care about you.

14:37.126 --> 14:39.460
I'll always consider you my friend.

14:41.130 --> 14:44.382
Friendship is the foundation
of any lasting relationship.

14:45.384 --> 14:47.260
It's nice to be quoted accurately.

14:49.638 --> 14:51.890
Well, let me tell you something,
Agent Cooper.

14:52.057 --> 14:54.017
One of these days,
before you know it,

14:54.184 --> 14:56.561
I'm gonna be grown-up
and on my own,

14:56.729 --> 14:58.730
and you better watch out.

14:59.815 --> 15:02.108
Okay, Audrey. It's a deal.

15:05.946 --> 15:08.031
You know, there's only
one problem with you.

15:08.198 --> 15:10.074
You're perfect.

15:27.885 --> 15:29.719
It's big.

15:30.387 --> 15:32.972
But it is bad.

15:38.062 --> 15:40.605
Leo just got that suit.

15:41.273 --> 15:43.942
Fits him a little tighter.

15:45.027 --> 15:48.863
Yeah, it's a shame to let good threads
go to waste.

15:49.031 --> 15:50.573
What do you think?

15:50.741 --> 15:54.035
Green or yellow?

15:54.995 --> 15:59.374
I gotta look good. Ben Horne is a man
who notices these things, you know?

15:59.541 --> 16:02.335
Bobby, honey, you look great.

16:03.420 --> 16:06.714
Can you take me out tonight, please?
I'll get all dressed up.

16:07.633 --> 16:10.468
What about Leo?
We just leave him here? Heh.

16:14.682 --> 16:17.934
I don't know. I'll get a sitter.
I've gotta get out of this house.

16:18.227 --> 16:21.771
Sweetheart, lover, listen to me.

16:21.939 --> 16:28.069
If I land this job with Ben Horne,
we're on easy street.

16:28.237 --> 16:31.155
I'll take care of you in ways
you never even dreamed of.

16:31.824 --> 16:33.366
Hang in there,

16:33.534 --> 16:37.662
and let Bobby do his thing.

16:37.830 --> 16:41.666
It's for both of us, okay?

16:43.961 --> 16:46.379
I gotta ramble.

16:46.880 --> 16:51.134
Cross your fingers, cross your toes.
This is the big time. Whoo!

16:51.301 --> 16:52.844
Later.

17:13.615 --> 17:15.158
Hello, Harry.

17:17.286 --> 17:19.871
Forgive my saying so, Catherine...

17:20.539 --> 17:22.123
...but aren't you dead?

17:24.501 --> 17:26.210
Does Pete know?

17:26.378 --> 17:29.630
My husband and I
will be duly reunited.

17:29.798 --> 17:33.843
Well, all things considered,
welcome home.

17:34.678 --> 17:38.556
- Any questions?
- Yeah, a couple.

17:38.724 --> 17:41.392
Am I under suspicion?

17:41.560 --> 17:43.561
I guess that depends
on the answers I get.

17:43.729 --> 17:46.522
Maybe you'd like to call your lawyer.

17:48.192 --> 17:49.984
That won't be necessary.

17:50.152 --> 17:54.238
- I have nothing to hide.
- Good. Good.

17:54.406 --> 17:56.574
Well, for starters,

17:56.742 --> 17:59.786
where the hell have you been
the past two weeks?

18:00.079 --> 18:01.913
Harry.

18:02.831 --> 18:05.500
Do you believe in guardian angels?

18:05.667 --> 18:08.044
Guardian angels?

18:08.212 --> 18:10.421
Catherine, to tell you the truth,

18:10.589 --> 18:13.883
I'm not so sure what I believe
these days.

18:15.636 --> 18:20.598
I believe an angel saved my life.

18:22.142 --> 18:24.727
I was home the night of the fire.

18:24.895 --> 18:28.356
A man called.
The voice, I didn't recognize.

18:28.524 --> 18:30.983
He asked me to meet him
at the drying shed.

18:31.151 --> 18:35.488
There was a vague threat implied.
So I went and I took my gun.

18:35.656 --> 18:37.907
And that girl... What's her name?

18:38.575 --> 18:40.868
- Shelly Johnson.
- Johnson. She was there.

18:41.036 --> 18:43.329
She was tied up inside.

18:43.622 --> 18:46.082
I think a bomb went off. I...

18:46.250 --> 18:52.296
I have nothing but impressions after
that, just walls of flame, screaming...

18:52.464 --> 18:57.927
I have no idea of how I escaped.
But I found myself in the woods.

19:00.556 --> 19:02.598
I was afraid.

19:05.310 --> 19:08.437
I was afraid for the first time
in my life.

19:08.856 --> 19:12.441
I dragged myself through the night.

19:12.609 --> 19:16.237
Then, as the sky lightened,

19:16.405 --> 19:19.198
things began to look familiar.

19:19.408 --> 19:24.787
The woods. The path.
A rock formation.

19:25.789 --> 19:27.915
And I was...

19:29.168 --> 19:31.377
...flooded with...

19:32.254 --> 19:34.672
...memories of my childhood.

19:35.299 --> 19:39.760
I thought, "This is what heaven is."

19:39.928 --> 19:44.223
And that's when I saw
our old summer cabin in the woods.

19:46.768 --> 19:52.481
Heaven was Pearl Lakes.
I'd walked miles through the night.

19:52.649 --> 19:56.485
Only a guardian angel
could have brought me there.

20:01.325 --> 20:03.534
Thank you.

20:03.702 --> 20:07.455
Thank God we always kept
a well-stocked pantry.

20:07.623 --> 20:12.168
I went in and I...
I opened a can of tuna fish.

20:12.336 --> 20:16.547
And I waited for whoever it was that
was trying to kill me to finish the job.

20:17.466 --> 20:20.259
A loaded gun by my side.

20:20.427 --> 20:24.764
I was terrified that every moment
was going to be my last.

20:24.932 --> 20:27.934
What made you come back?

20:29.061 --> 20:31.604
I ran out of tuna fish.

20:32.481 --> 20:35.107
Great news. I quit smoking.

20:35.275 --> 20:38.277
- What are you doing here?
- I wanted to see you.

20:38.445 --> 20:40.279
I wanted...

20:40.447 --> 20:45.243
To be honest, I wanted to talk
about our bambino.

20:45.452 --> 20:47.036
Our bambino?

20:47.204 --> 20:50.915
Lucy, I have been in a ghastly turmoil,
and do you know what I've discovered?

20:51.083 --> 20:54.752
I, Richard Tremayne,
am a terrible, crashing bore.

20:54.920 --> 20:59.006
And what I desperately require
in my life is something...

20:59.174 --> 21:05.972
No, someone.... more important
than myself to think about, to care for.

21:06.139 --> 21:10.059
So perhaps you can see why that,
as a result, I must say,

21:10.227 --> 21:13.729
parenthood is suddenly
so appealing.

21:13.897 --> 21:16.774
- Parenthood?
- Fatherhood, more specifically.

21:16.942 --> 21:19.402
And since I have no skills
in this area...

21:19.611 --> 21:21.946
Nurturing is a relatively
foreign concept.

21:22.114 --> 21:23.155
Shh.

21:23.323 --> 21:28.202
- I've enlisted myself in
the Happy Helping Hand program.

21:28.370 --> 21:33.874
Part-time big brother
to some adorable, homeless waif.

21:35.460 --> 21:37.586
Excuse me,
are you the same Dick Tremayne

21:37.754 --> 21:40.965
that works at
Horne's Department Store?

21:41.133 --> 21:44.468
Yes. And, Lucy, I must say,

21:44.636 --> 21:49.348
I have absolute confidence
that the child is mine.

21:50.726 --> 21:52.560
Lucy.

21:53.979 --> 21:58.858
Lucy, Dick, I have something
I'd like to say.

21:59.943 --> 22:02.653
What is it, Andy?

22:02.821 --> 22:08.075
I would like to say that we're all
in a very difficult position.

22:08.285 --> 22:11.329
I come from a large family.
And Mama always said

22:11.538 --> 22:13.581
she couldn't have
fussing and fighting around her

22:13.749 --> 22:15.583
when she had a bun in the oven.

22:16.335 --> 22:20.671
And until we know for sure
who's gonna be throwing that baseball,

22:20.839 --> 22:25.384
or building that dollhouse,
we should all be friends.

22:44.029 --> 22:48.532
So you two go right ahead and talk,
and I'll see you.

22:53.163 --> 22:55.039
Andy, are you crazy?

22:55.207 --> 22:57.750
Hawk, I know Lucy
and I know what'd get her:

22:57.918 --> 23:01.087
Morals and manly behavior.

23:01.922 --> 23:04.048
You think I went too far?

23:06.218 --> 23:08.636
- Harry?
- Hey.

23:11.264 --> 23:14.141
Well, I guess this is goodbye.

23:14.309 --> 23:18.020
Major Briggs says there's a frying pan
full of steelhead trout out there

23:18.188 --> 23:19.688
with my name on them.

23:19.856 --> 23:23.275
That's why I figure
you're gonna be needing this.

23:33.537 --> 23:34.829
Harry...

23:38.166 --> 23:40.876
...this is unbelievable.
- Yeah.

23:41.586 --> 23:44.213
Now, when those steelhead
are running upstream,

23:44.381 --> 23:48.217
they're only thinking
about one thing. Sex.

23:48.385 --> 23:51.595
A Green Butt Skunk
breaks their concentration.

23:51.763 --> 23:54.765
A Green Butt Skunk.

23:55.600 --> 23:57.810
Yeah.

23:57.978 --> 24:01.564
Tied it myself.
My dad taught me how.

24:02.065 --> 24:04.191
His dad taught him.

24:04.359 --> 24:06.193
Harry, I don't know what to say.

24:06.403 --> 24:09.280
Oh, one more thing.

24:13.452 --> 24:15.911
I'll recycle this.

24:20.584 --> 24:23.210
Bookhouse Boy patch.

24:25.380 --> 24:28.966
We all agreed.
You're one of us now.

24:31.511 --> 24:36.265
Harry, I am honored beyond
my ability to express myself.

24:36.433 --> 24:38.309
You wear that in good health.

24:38.518 --> 24:42.438
You ever need us, we'll be there.

24:55.535 --> 24:57.286
Deputy Hawk.

24:57.913 --> 25:01.248
If I'm ever lost, I hope you're
the man they send to find me.

25:01.666 --> 25:05.002
May the wind be always at your back.

25:06.505 --> 25:08.214
Deputy Andy.

25:08.423 --> 25:11.550
Your bravery is only exceeded
by the size of your heart.

25:11.718 --> 25:13.511
A rare combination, indeed.

25:16.765 --> 25:19.642
Lucy, my best to you and yours.

25:19.851 --> 25:21.852
Now, you better invite me
to that wedding,

25:22.020 --> 25:24.313
whoever the lucky man might be.

25:28.401 --> 25:31.529
- Sheriff Truman?
- Yeah.

25:31.738 --> 25:34.406
This is Special Agent Roger Hardy
of the FBI.

25:34.616 --> 25:36.325
Roger, what are you doing here?

25:36.535 --> 25:38.786
Dale, we've got a problem.

25:38.954 --> 25:41.372
Effective immediately, without pay,

25:41.540 --> 25:45.960
I regret to inform you
of your suspension from the FBI.

25:54.761 --> 25:56.637
Cooper, I suspect you know
why I'm here.

25:56.805 --> 25:58.764
- I don't.
- Internal Affairs.

25:58.932 --> 26:01.100
We're the agents
who watch the agents.

26:01.268 --> 26:03.894
And his presence refers
to my crossing into Canada.

26:04.062 --> 26:07.273
Hold on, that was directly related
to a case we were investigating.

26:07.440 --> 26:09.441
Not without my knowing
about it, it wasn't.

26:09.609 --> 26:11.819
What's the charge, Roger?
Misfeasance?

26:11.987 --> 26:13.112
"Mis"-what?

26:13.280 --> 26:15.322
The improper and unlawful execution
of an act

26:15.490 --> 26:17.241
that is in itself proper and lawful.

26:17.409 --> 26:19.618
- The rescue of Audrey Horne.
- In part.

26:19.786 --> 26:23.956
There's also the disturbing allegation
as to your motives and your methods.

26:24.124 --> 26:25.332
What allegation?

26:25.500 --> 26:28.002
Well, I'm waiting
for some evidence to arrive.

26:28.169 --> 26:30.087
We'll convene in one hour.

26:30.255 --> 26:32.214
Alone.

26:35.010 --> 26:38.095
Come on. Think.

26:45.979 --> 26:47.563
Mr. Horne wasn't expecting you.

26:47.731 --> 26:52.610
He said that possibly we could
set something up for you next month.

26:52.777 --> 26:55.696
Could you tell him it's about the tape
he got in the mail yesterday,

26:55.864 --> 26:57.072
and it's urgent?

26:57.240 --> 27:00.117
Could you tell him that, please?

27:05.540 --> 27:08.083
A little late for Halloween, isn't it?

27:09.002 --> 27:10.794
What?

27:12.464 --> 27:14.923
Oh, what are you supposed to be,
a lounge lizard?

27:16.676 --> 27:19.553
Shouldn't you be in school?

27:20.764 --> 27:23.766
School numbs my buns.
What about you?

27:24.184 --> 27:27.227
Oh, I'm just trying to get a meeting
with your father.

27:28.688 --> 27:31.106
What on earth do you wanna
talk to him about?

27:31.566 --> 27:35.069
A job. Business. It's personal.

27:36.071 --> 27:39.990
Hmm. I didn't know
Daddy dearest was hiring.

27:40.200 --> 27:44.161
Oh, you know me.
I just gotta talk to him first.

27:45.455 --> 27:47.873
Yeah. You're up to something,
Bobby Briggs,

27:48.041 --> 27:50.959
but I'm sure that's
none of my business.

27:51.127 --> 27:53.045
Count to ten.

27:57.300 --> 27:58.926
One,

27:59.094 --> 28:00.469
two,

28:00.637 --> 28:02.429
three,

28:02.597 --> 28:04.515
four,

28:04.683 --> 28:06.809
five...

28:10.689 --> 28:14.566
First rule of business
is you have to know who to speak to.

28:14.776 --> 28:16.568
Audrey.

28:19.906 --> 28:21.949
I owe you one.

28:28.123 --> 28:31.458
I know you're a busy man,
I respect that. I'll get right to the point.

28:33.211 --> 28:34.878
Samantha, bring in a fly swatter.

28:35.046 --> 28:37.131
There's a bug in my office.

28:39.968 --> 28:42.761
Hey! You're making
a big mistake. Let me go!

28:42.929 --> 28:47.057
Hey, hey, hey! Leave him alone.
He's a friend of mine.

28:52.105 --> 28:55.899
You could tell your boss
that that tape was not the original.

28:58.153 --> 29:01.655
- You okay?
- Yeah.

29:03.032 --> 29:06.326
I can't imagine what all this
is about, Bobby Briggs.

29:06.494 --> 29:09.455
You know, that's twice
you saved my bacon, Audrey.

29:09.622 --> 29:11.832
Could be talking sainthood.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.418
Is there anything I can do for you?

29:15.503 --> 29:17.629
How about an ice cream?

29:17.797 --> 29:22.634
- Cup or cone?
- Mm. Mm.

29:22.802 --> 29:26.430
Cone. I like to lick.

29:27.766 --> 29:30.601
What was the purpose
of your first visit to One-Eyed Jack's?

29:30.769 --> 29:34.104
To gather information about the death
of Laura Palmer from Jacques Renault.

29:34.314 --> 29:36.940
Who you apparently lured
back across the border,

29:37.108 --> 29:38.984
where he was wounded
while being arrested,

29:39.152 --> 29:41.361
and subsequently murdered
that night in the hospital.

29:42.071 --> 29:45.407
Renault was a material witness
to events leading up to Laura's death.

29:45.575 --> 29:49.411
Leland Palmer confessed to Jacques'
murder, which I believe he committed.

29:49.579 --> 29:51.538
Am I being held responsible
for this, Roger?

29:53.124 --> 29:54.792
Let's talk about your second visit.

29:55.001 --> 29:57.711
To rescue Audrey Horne
from her kidnappers.

29:58.254 --> 30:00.881
- And both are dead.
- You know procedure.

30:01.049 --> 30:03.467
Crossing the border without contacting
Canadian authorities

30:03.635 --> 30:06.470
is a serious breach
under any circumstances.

30:06.888 --> 30:09.056
I'm not disputing that, Roger.

30:09.224 --> 30:12.184
Is it the Bureau's position
that I'm responsible for these deaths?

30:12.352 --> 30:13.852
That's what we're trying
to determine.

30:14.479 --> 30:16.396
This matter was brought
to our attention

30:16.564 --> 30:18.941
because Mountie King was involved
in a sting operation

30:19.108 --> 30:21.318
to nail this Jean Renault.

30:22.946 --> 30:25.322
We worked six months to set this up.

30:25.490 --> 30:27.407
One night you march in,

30:27.575 --> 30:31.370
Renault escapes, two men are dead,

30:31.746 --> 30:33.956
and the cocaine we were using
for the setup

30:34.123 --> 30:35.582
was stolen from the premises.

30:35.750 --> 30:39.044
I don't know anything about
the cocaine, but you've miscounted.

30:39.212 --> 30:42.756
Three people were killed.
Jean Renault killed Blackie,

30:42.924 --> 30:45.384
I didn't know about
the Battis murder until now,

30:45.593 --> 30:48.470
and the bodyguard who turned his gun
on me was killed in self-defense.

30:48.638 --> 30:51.056
So what we have
is crossing jurisdictional borders,

30:51.224 --> 30:54.434
three dead bodies
and international drug trafficking.

30:54.644 --> 30:56.645
I admit to the border crossing.

30:56.813 --> 31:00.607
I told you the extent of my involvement
with the killings.

31:00.775 --> 31:02.359
Roger, I hope you know me better

31:02.527 --> 31:05.404
than to suspect I would have anything
to do with a drug transaction.

31:05.613 --> 31:07.823
I won't know that
until you prove it, Cooper.

31:07.991 --> 31:11.743
And I might add, the DEA's been
brought in to investigate.

31:11.911 --> 31:15.247
You have 24 hours
to assemble your defense.

31:15.957 --> 31:20.711
In the meantime, I'll require
that you surrender your gun.

31:20.879 --> 31:23.005
And your badge.

31:33.516 --> 31:35.642
Sheriff Truman.

31:47.697 --> 31:51.450
Sheriff, please.
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

31:52.452 --> 31:54.119
I'll stand.

31:54.662 --> 31:57.831
Well, let me begin by saying

31:57.999 --> 32:01.919
whatever Agent Cooper's guilty of
will not be held against you.

32:02.086 --> 32:06.465
And your cooperation will be useful
and greatly appreciated.

32:08.927 --> 32:13.096
If I understand the law correctly,

32:13.264 --> 32:17.434
you need extradition papers
in order to get a statement from me.

32:17.602 --> 32:20.812
And you need a subpoena
from a judge.

32:20.980 --> 32:24.566
Now, unless you gentlemen
have that paperwork,

32:24.734 --> 32:27.903
I suggest you take
your cooperation...

32:28.321 --> 32:29.488
...and stuff it.

32:31.491 --> 32:37.079
That attitude will not serve you
or Agent Cooper.

32:37.288 --> 32:40.332
That's not an attitude.
That's a promise.

32:40.500 --> 32:44.753
Agent Cooper is the finest lawman
I've ever known.

32:44.921 --> 32:49.675
I've had nothing but respect for him
since he arrived in Twin Peaks.

32:51.010 --> 32:54.096
Now, I don't know
what information you have

32:54.263 --> 32:56.515
or where you got it from,

32:56.683 --> 32:58.892
but it is dead wrong.

33:00.853 --> 33:02.604
Thank you for your time.

33:05.525 --> 33:10.112
Help yourself to a coffee
on the way out.

33:16.911 --> 33:21.206
Steeplejacks, Steeplejacks, roll them!

33:25.294 --> 33:27.295
Too short.

33:27.463 --> 33:30.382
And Nadine.

33:31.884 --> 33:33.510
Nadine Butler.

33:36.389 --> 33:40.684
All right, Nadine. Let's start you off
with a little tumbling.

33:49.360 --> 33:52.237
- Next event, corkscrew.
- My gosh. Did you see her do this?

33:52.572 --> 33:53.989
Hold on. I'm gonna throw you.

33:54.157 --> 33:55.323
Yeah, sure, you are.

33:55.491 --> 33:56.867
Corkscrew!

34:10.214 --> 34:12.966
- Can you believe that?
- No, I don't.

34:22.810 --> 34:25.228
I'm not answering that.

34:28.775 --> 34:31.651
All day and not one word.

34:39.619 --> 34:41.912
Johnson's Nursing Home.

34:42.997 --> 34:45.207
That's great, Bobby.
I'm glad things went so well.

34:45.374 --> 34:48.210
Must have been
the longest meeting in history.

34:49.712 --> 34:52.130
Yeah, I still love you.

34:52.298 --> 34:55.050
Bobby, I've been thinking.

34:55.218 --> 34:59.137
We have to do something with Leo.
Put him in a home.

34:59.305 --> 35:03.016
It's not worth it.
I don't want the money.

35:04.602 --> 35:07.145
Bobby, I want a life.

35:12.902 --> 35:14.903
He moved.

35:15.863 --> 35:17.531
Bobby...

35:18.366 --> 35:19.908
...Leo moved.

35:26.541 --> 35:28.583
What's with the tablecloths?

35:28.751 --> 35:32.212
The critic has spoken.
I feel like a fool.

35:32.380 --> 35:36.800
Norma, pick your lower lip up
off the floor. It wasn't that bad.

35:36.968 --> 35:39.219
Mother, please don't tell me
how to feel.

35:39.387 --> 35:42.681
This business is all I've got.
I wanna keep my regular customers.

35:42.849 --> 35:45.934
I don't care if anyone new
ever comes in here again.

35:46.102 --> 35:47.978
They probably won't.

35:48.146 --> 35:51.481
Not after, "If you want local color,
stop in.

35:51.649 --> 35:56.528
But if it's good food you want,
find a wider berth."

35:56.696 --> 35:59.906
It was "local charm," not "color."

36:01.242 --> 36:06.580
- You memorized that piece of trash?
- No. I wrote it.

36:08.166 --> 36:13.086
You might as well know, so that we
can get this little melodrama over with.

36:18.092 --> 36:20.677
I don't believe it.

36:20.845 --> 36:24.639
Is that why you came to visit,
so you could run me into the ground?

36:24.807 --> 36:28.810
No. Darling, I wanted to give you
a good review.

36:28.978 --> 36:32.522
This is just not a good restaurant.

36:32.690 --> 36:35.650
I can't violate my professional ethics.

36:35.985 --> 36:37.652
Ethics?

36:38.404 --> 36:39.988
I'm your daughter.

36:41.407 --> 36:43.450
Some standards have to prevail.

36:45.786 --> 36:49.372
What about the standards
of common decency and kindness?

36:50.291 --> 36:53.168
Or don't those standards
fit into your profession?

36:53.336 --> 36:55.545
Of course they do.

36:56.047 --> 36:58.798
I wouldn't treat a dog like this,
no less my own daughter.

36:58.966 --> 37:01.092
Oh, as usual you're overreacting.

37:01.260 --> 37:02.594
- Am I?
- Mm-hm.

37:03.888 --> 37:05.931
Maybe I am,

37:06.098 --> 37:08.225
but they're my reactions.

37:08.392 --> 37:10.977
And the hurt I feel is my hurt,

37:11.145 --> 37:14.189
and how I react
is none of your damn business.

37:15.566 --> 37:18.735
- Dear, be sensible.
- I'm being very sensible.

37:19.695 --> 37:22.155
I want you out of this place.

37:22.323 --> 37:25.367
I want you out of my life.
I don't wanna be hurt by you anymore.

37:26.744 --> 37:28.370
Norma.

37:29.538 --> 37:31.498
Goodbye.

37:32.333 --> 37:34.292
Go.

37:47.306 --> 37:49.683
Yeah. Yeah.

37:52.812 --> 37:55.522
- Yes.
- Oh, yeah.

37:55.690 --> 37:58.358
Okay, kids, come on,
we'll take you another time.

37:58.526 --> 38:01.278
- Go on, go.
Whoo, whoo.

38:02.905 --> 38:06.157
Whoa. We bagged our limit
and we didn't even fire a shot.

38:06.325 --> 38:10.412
- Get off me, man.
- Welcome to the fighter zone.

38:10.579 --> 38:12.205
- I remind you.
- What?

38:12.373 --> 38:14.582
I'm a happily married man.
Recently married.

38:14.750 --> 38:17.294
To an extremely wealthy woman.

38:17.461 --> 38:21.715
As we discussed, we're really eager
to do business with you.

38:21.882 --> 38:24.384
Look, I will not steal
my wife's money.

38:24.552 --> 38:27.637
I feel guilty enough about lying to her
about this hunting trip.

38:27.805 --> 38:29.222
- Hey, no harm, no foul.
- Get off.

38:29.390 --> 38:32.267
- She bought it, didn't she?
- I don't know. She doesn't miss much.

38:32.435 --> 38:34.519
And I don't like
this stealing business.

38:34.687 --> 38:36.396
Stealing?
Who said anything about stealing?

38:36.564 --> 38:39.607
- I've had enough of this.
- You're the computer expert, buddy.

38:39.775 --> 38:42.068
Just hit the keys,
and she won't see a ripple.

38:42.236 --> 38:43.778
- Look at it this way.
- Get off.

38:43.946 --> 38:46.156
You don't help us, how long
you think she'll stay your wife?

38:46.324 --> 38:48.325
- I'm getting mad.
- You want me to release you?

38:48.492 --> 38:50.327
Hold it or I'll have to kill you.

38:50.494 --> 38:52.704
You better get with the program, pal.

38:52.913 --> 38:54.831
Get off.

38:58.336 --> 39:01.713
So this is him?

39:02.965 --> 39:04.758
Ernie,

39:04.925 --> 39:07.093
- meet Jean Renault.
- Hi.

39:08.637 --> 39:12.349
I met him one night in the woods,
when he stuck a pistol in my ear.

39:12.516 --> 39:16.603
Lucky for me, I had my state
prosecutor's badge with me.

39:16.771 --> 39:19.647
Never leave home without it.

39:19.815 --> 39:22.108
Jean, this is the Professor.

39:22.276 --> 39:25.278
What he can do with numbers would
make a 1000-dollar-a-night hooker

39:25.488 --> 39:27.989
- blush like a nun.
- Ah.

39:28.157 --> 39:32.369
Well, a recent investment opportunity
fell through,

39:32.536 --> 39:34.913
leave us in a cash-poor position.

39:35.081 --> 39:39.417
We need 125,000 immediately.

39:42.171 --> 39:44.381
I understand completely.

39:45.216 --> 39:48.843
- You do?
- Yeah, this will not be difficult.

39:49.053 --> 39:52.305
Just so you know
a little bit more about me,

39:52.473 --> 39:54.891
I've been associated

39:55.059 --> 39:58.561
with some of the most prestigious
financial institutions in this country.

39:59.188 --> 40:01.523
I've laundered
massive amounts of money.

40:01.690 --> 40:04.192
I've brokered tremendous deals
for the Colombian

40:04.360 --> 40:06.194
and the Bolivian industries.

40:06.362 --> 40:10.407
In other words, I'm wired in, okay?
I mean, I'm hardwired.

40:10.574 --> 40:13.910
I'm your man. Definitely.
I'm definitely your man. Yeah.

40:14.578 --> 40:18.331
- Well, you say the magic words.
- Good.

40:20.459 --> 40:22.419
Nicely done, Ernie.
Are you making this up?

40:22.586 --> 40:24.796
No, no.

40:27.842 --> 40:32.554
This is the Professor,
our new broker.

40:35.391 --> 40:36.975
Hi.

40:48.195 --> 40:51.197
You can handle a puny little bundle
like this, can't you?

40:51.365 --> 40:53.366
Yes, he can take care of it for us,
can't you?

40:53.534 --> 40:55.827
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:55.995 --> 40:59.706
Hank, take the Professor
down to the tables.

40:59.874 --> 41:02.792
I understand you have
a very good system

41:02.960 --> 41:04.878
for the craps and roulette.

41:05.045 --> 41:06.880
Very scientific, eh?

41:07.047 --> 41:10.008
I don't gamble anymore.
I used to, but I don't gamble anymore.

41:10.176 --> 41:13.386
- It's a mug's game, you know?
- Mm. Tsk, tsk, tsk. No.

41:13.554 --> 41:15.346
- We all gamble here.
- Ah.

41:15.514 --> 41:18.183
You must enjoy life.

41:20.227 --> 41:22.437
- Yeah, I'll try it. Thank you.
- Yes. Come on.

41:22.605 --> 41:24.939
Come on. Let's go.

41:30.070 --> 41:33.198
I don't like the look of him.
Too nervous.

41:33.365 --> 41:35.575
We'll see, won't we?

41:36.368 --> 41:42.665
Four for us, and just a little
to put the last nail in Cooper's coffin.

41:45.669 --> 41:49.964
- I'll call you when I'm done.
- Where will you put it?

41:51.592 --> 41:53.384
The car.

41:53.552 --> 41:57.889
Won't take much,
just a trace of this.

41:59.266 --> 42:03.394
I want him crucified.

42:59.451 --> 43:01.077
- Oh...
- Josie. Josie.

43:01.245 --> 43:02.704
Help me, Harry.

43:29.106 --> 43:31.107
At the time,
I did what I thought was right.

43:31.275 --> 43:33.526
I must now face the consequences.

43:33.694 --> 43:35.570
You can do no more.

43:38.282 --> 43:42.285
You know, major,
I find myself thinking a lot about Bob.

43:42.453 --> 43:45.538
If he truly exists.

43:45.706 --> 43:49.959
I've pondered that same question
continuously

43:50.127 --> 43:52.962
since this horror was revealed to us.

43:54.965 --> 43:58.051
I try to imagine him
out there incarnate,

43:59.720 --> 44:03.097
looking for another victim to inhabit.

44:04.433 --> 44:09.395
There are powerful forces of evil.

44:10.481 --> 44:16.069
It is some men's fate
to face great darkness.

44:17.237 --> 44:19.572
We each choose how to react.

44:20.616 --> 44:23.076
If the choice is fear,

44:23.243 --> 44:25.787
then we become vulnerable
to darkness.

44:25.954 --> 44:28.206
There are ways to resist.

44:28.374 --> 44:32.377
You, sir, were blessed
with certain gifts.

44:32.544 --> 44:35.296
In this respect, you're not alone.

44:36.799 --> 44:41.094
Have you ever heard
of the White Lodge?

44:42.805 --> 44:45.348
The White Lodge?

44:45.974 --> 44:48.142
No, I don't believe I have.

44:58.070 --> 45:01.656
Major, I'm gonna take
a moment here.

45:02.533 --> 45:04.909
I feel the call of nature.

45:05.911 --> 45:09.539
There's nothing quite like urinating
out in the open air.

45:09.707 --> 45:13.918
I look forward to hearing more
about this White Lodge.

45:17.172 --> 45:20.758
When I return from my journey.

45:59.006 --> 46:02.550
Cooper!

46:07.014 --> 46:08.723
Major Briggs?

46:10.601 --> 47:21.462
Major!
