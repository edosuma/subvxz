WEBVTT

00:04.046 --> 00:07.048
On your right.
On your right. On your right.

00:07.174 --> 00:08.216
Back, back, back,
back, back.

00:08.342 --> 00:09.967
Come on, buddy.

00:12.846 --> 00:15.181
Yeah, Dan! Yeah!

00:15.307 --> 00:16.974
Yeah!
Yeah!

00:17.142 --> 00:18.768
Back, back,
back, back, back.

00:18.894 --> 00:21.062
Come on!
Watch the winger!

00:32.199 --> 00:33.199
Yeah!

00:58.016 --> 00:58.850
You okay?

00:59.810 --> 01:04.063
Dan? Dan, talk to me.
Dan. Dan.

01:05.899 --> 01:07.734
Get a doctor!

01:48.817 --> 01:50.735
- Hey.
- Close the door.

01:50.861 --> 01:52.195
Close the door.

01:55.616 --> 01:58.159
Is Cuddy down the hall
counting to 50?

01:58.827 --> 02:01.579
She knows I'm in here,
in the clinic, as she commanded.

02:01.705 --> 02:03.122
She just doesn't know
I'm alone.

02:03.457 --> 02:05.166
Well, you've got
a full waiting room.

02:05.292 --> 02:06.751
How long do you think
you can ignore them?

02:06.877 --> 02:08.377
I'm off at 4:00.

02:09.546 --> 02:12.548
You're doing this
to avoid five minutes of work?

02:12.674 --> 02:14.842
If I go out there, I get assigned
a kid with a runny nose.

02:14.968 --> 02:16.135
That's 30 seconds
looking at the nose,

02:16.261 --> 02:18.179
25 minutes
talking to a worried mom

02:18.305 --> 02:20.640
who won't leave until she's sure
it's not meningitis or a tumor.

02:20.766 --> 02:23.059
Yes. Concerned parents
can be so annoying.

02:23.352 --> 02:25.561
Just tell Cuddy you've got
an urgent case. You had to leave early.

02:25.687 --> 02:27.980
- That would be lying.
- And that would be wrong.

02:28.106 --> 02:31.567
But luckily the definition
of "urgent" is fungible.

02:31.985 --> 02:34.695
Not the definition
of "case", though.

02:37.699 --> 02:43.120
You have no cases?

02:43.956 --> 02:46.624
You've got handpicked doctors,
specialists

02:46.750 --> 02:49.877
working for you,
and they're sitting on their hands?

02:50.003 --> 02:53.631
- Cameron's answering my mail.
- Oh, time well spent, I'm sure.

02:53.757 --> 02:55.341
Foreman and Chase?

02:56.343 --> 02:57.385
Research?

03:04.393 --> 03:07.144
Nine letters.
Iodine deficiency in children.

03:07.271 --> 03:08.688
Cretinism.

03:18.448 --> 03:21.826
So, 4:03 p.m.,
Dr. House checks out.

03:21.952 --> 03:24.495
- Please write that down.
- Dr. House.

03:24.621 --> 03:27.373
Sorry. Done for the day.
Plenty of docs here to take care of you.

03:27.499 --> 03:29.083
But we had
an appointment.

03:29.209 --> 03:31.002
Nice try,
but this is a walk-in clinic,

03:31.128 --> 03:32.128
which means there
are no appointments.

03:32.254 --> 03:34.088
You walk in, sign the chart
and a doctor will see you.

03:34.214 --> 03:35.214
Just not me.

03:35.340 --> 03:38.134
Your letter says
that we'd see you.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.971
- Not a big letter writer.
- Here.

03:44.892 --> 03:47.351
When did my signature
get so girlie?

03:48.270 --> 03:49.270
I can explain.

03:49.396 --> 03:50.688
See that "G"?

03:50.814 --> 03:52.356
See how it makes
a big loop on top?

03:52.482 --> 03:54.734
Doesn't even look
like my handwriting.

03:54.860 --> 03:57.320
Think I have something?
What's the differential diagnosis

03:57.446 --> 03:59.322
for writing G's like
a junior high school girl?

03:59.448 --> 04:01.282
It's impossible to get to you
through normal channels.

04:01.408 --> 04:02.533
They have called, e-mailed.

04:02.659 --> 04:04.035
Perseverance does
not equal worthiness.

04:04.161 --> 04:06.787
Next time you want to get my attention,
wear something fun.

04:06.914 --> 04:10.333
- Low-rider jeans are hot.
- Sixteen-year-old male.

04:10.459 --> 04:12.752
Sudden onset of double vision
and night terrors,

04:12.878 --> 04:14.045
with no apparent cause.

04:14.171 --> 04:16.797
- The kid's been to two neurologists...
- Night terrors?

04:16.924 --> 04:20.092
- As in big scary monsters?
- Yes.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.932
- Where are you going?
- To see the family.

04:26.058 --> 04:27.058
You're going to
examine a patient?

04:27.184 --> 04:29.810
Nine times out of 10,
there's no reason to talk to a patient.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.729
But night terrors
in a 16-year-old

04:31.855 --> 04:35.900
is a very good reason to talk
to this family. Good work.

04:38.820 --> 04:40.738
Margins are fine.

04:41.365 --> 04:42.823
No lesions.

04:44.117 --> 04:45.868
Color is good.

04:46.536 --> 04:48.746
How long have you been
having night terrors?

04:48.872 --> 04:50.957
- Three weeks.
- He's afraid to go to bed.

04:51.083 --> 04:53.751
He's exhausted,
can barely function.

04:55.087 --> 04:56.087
What does that tell you?

04:56.213 --> 04:58.631
Nothing. It's just fun
watching him blink.

04:59.132 --> 05:00.633
Name as many animals
as you can

05:00.759 --> 05:03.302
that begin with
the letter "B". Go.

05:10.435 --> 05:11.435
Baby elephant?

05:11.561 --> 05:13.437
Baby elephant is
actually a good answer.

05:13.563 --> 05:15.398
- "B" is a bear of a letter.
- What does that tell you?

05:15.524 --> 05:17.608
Proves two things,
no neurological damage,

05:17.734 --> 05:19.735
and your son is never gonna
be chief fry cook.

05:20.570 --> 05:24.031
In teens, there are
two likely causes of night terrors.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.116
Post-traumatic stress.

05:25.242 --> 05:26.993
Any recent shoot-outs
at your high school?

05:27.119 --> 05:28.327
- No.
- Well, then, Dave...

05:28.453 --> 05:29.996
- Dan.
- If there's no trauma,

05:30.122 --> 05:33.040
the other cause
is sexual abuse.

05:36.128 --> 05:37.670
So who's molesting you?

05:37.796 --> 05:39.839
Teacher?
Extra-friendly neighbor?

05:40.424 --> 05:42.425
I'd ask if either of you were involved,
but you'd deny it.

05:42.551 --> 05:44.135
No. We would never do
anything to hurt Dan.

05:44.261 --> 05:46.220
I say it here,
it comes out there.

05:46.763 --> 05:49.181
This lack of response is
consistent with abuse.

05:49.307 --> 05:51.308
There's no one, okay?
I swear.

05:52.144 --> 05:53.227
There was trauma.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.980
I got hit in the head
during a lacrosse game.

05:56.857 --> 05:59.608
Did you know that
he got hit in the head?

06:00.110 --> 06:02.069
They didn't mention it. No.

06:02.195 --> 06:03.654
Yeah. Why bother?

06:06.658 --> 06:09.660
No, no. We took him to
the ER after the game.

06:09.786 --> 06:12.163
He was scanned. They tested him.
They said he was fine.

06:12.289 --> 06:13.330
No concussion.
It's gotta be...

06:13.457 --> 06:17.209
You hound me for my opinion,
and then you question my diagnosis.

06:17.335 --> 06:18.419
Cool.

06:18.545 --> 06:20.796
ER obviously screwed up.
Kid's got a concussion.

06:20.922 --> 06:22.381
I had double vision
before I was hit.

06:22.507 --> 06:24.341
Well, that changes everything.

06:24.468 --> 06:27.136
You need glasses.
That's why you had double vision,

06:27.262 --> 06:29.138
which is why you got hit,
which is why you have a concussion,

06:29.264 --> 06:31.557
which is why you
have night terrors.

06:31.683 --> 06:34.685
You need to see an ophthalmologist,
which I am not.

06:35.187 --> 06:36.604
You enjoyed that.

06:36.730 --> 06:38.147
I brought a reasonable case
to your attention,

06:38.273 --> 06:40.149
and you shoved it in my face
just to humiliate me.

06:40.275 --> 06:43.152
- You're an only child, aren't you?
- Why would you say that?

06:43.278 --> 06:44.862
Because everything
is about you.

06:46.114 --> 06:47.948
This may seem
incredibly controversial,

06:48.075 --> 06:50.284
but I think
sexual abuse is bad.

06:50.410 --> 06:53.788
I just wanted to make sure he wasn't
being diddled by daddy or mommy.

06:53.914 --> 06:55.956
Anything else is
just a bonus.

07:06.468 --> 07:09.136
- I'm not an only child.
- Interesting.

07:10.347 --> 07:12.515
- What?
- Don't move.

07:13.350 --> 07:17.061
- Did I bore you in there?
- What? No. Not really.

07:17.187 --> 07:18.020
Are you tired?

07:19.523 --> 07:21.607
- Sometimes.
- He never sleeps. Of course he's tired.

07:21.733 --> 07:23.651
- Right now. Are you tired?
- No. No.

07:23.777 --> 07:27.029
That twitch in your leg.
Did you feel that?

07:28.198 --> 07:30.491
- Didn't hurt.
- His leg twitched. I don't see what...

07:30.617 --> 07:32.326
It's called
a myoclonic jerk.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.078
It's very common
when you're falling asleep.

07:34.204 --> 07:35.412
Respiration rate falls,

07:35.539 --> 07:38.082
and the brain sometimes
interprets this as the body dying,

07:38.208 --> 07:39.166
so it sends
a pulse to wake it up.

07:39.292 --> 07:42.878
- So?
- So, he's not asleep. He's awake.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.257
Admit him.

07:49.553 --> 07:52.346
I recognize
that loopy "G".

07:53.223 --> 07:55.057
So, what does
the jerk tell us?

07:55.183 --> 07:57.810
Nothing good.
The brain's losing control of the body.

07:57.936 --> 07:59.145
Can't order
the eyes to focus,

07:59.271 --> 08:00.729
regulate sleep patterns
or control muscles.

08:00.856 --> 08:03.107
A movement disorder
or a degenerative brain disease.

08:03.233 --> 08:05.109
Either way, this kid's gonna be
picking up his diploma

08:05.235 --> 08:06.277
in diapers and
a wheelchair.

08:06.403 --> 08:08.529
Maybe not that bad.
Could be an infection.

08:08.655 --> 08:10.948
You wish.
No fever, no white count.

08:11.074 --> 08:13.868
Anyone think this differential
diagnosis might be compromised

08:13.994 --> 08:16.245
because we don't have
an accurate family history?

08:16.371 --> 08:17.872
I took
an accurate family history.

08:17.998 --> 08:20.499
You didn't even take
an accurate family.

08:20.625 --> 08:22.543
- His father's not his father.
- Why would you say that?

08:22.669 --> 08:23.919
Thirty percent of all
dads out there

08:24.045 --> 08:25.838
don't realize they're
raising someone else's kid.

08:25.964 --> 08:27.673
From what I've read,
false paternity's more like 10%.

08:27.799 --> 08:29.300
That's what our moms
would like us to believe.

08:29.426 --> 08:31.927
Who cares? If he got it from his
parents, they'd both be dead by now.

08:32.053 --> 08:33.554
Can we get on with
the differential diagnosis?

08:33.680 --> 08:34.847
Fifty bucks says I'm right.

08:34.973 --> 08:36.849
- I'll take your money.
- Hit a nerve?

08:36.975 --> 08:37.933
Don't worry, Foreman.

08:38.059 --> 08:39.852
I'm sure the guy who tucked you in
at night was your daddy.

08:39.978 --> 08:41.520
Make it $100.

08:41.646 --> 08:44.815
What about leukoencephalopathy
in a 16-year-old?

08:44.941 --> 08:47.026
It doesn't necessarily
have to be that bad.

08:47.152 --> 08:47.943
If we exclude
the night terrors,

08:48.069 --> 08:49.028
it could be
something systemic.

08:49.154 --> 08:51.739
His liver, kidneys.
Something outside the brain.

08:51.865 --> 08:55.201
Yes. Feel free to exclude any symptom
if it makes your job easier.

08:55.327 --> 08:57.578
The night terrors were anecdotal.
He could've had a bad dream.

08:57.704 --> 08:59.496
No. Parents said he was
conscious during the event

08:59.623 --> 09:01.749
and didn't remember
anything afterwards.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.292
- That's a night terror.
- Parents said?

09:04.169 --> 09:05.127
That's a good point.

09:05.253 --> 09:08.756
Before we condemn this kid, maybe we
should entertain Dr. Chase's skepticism.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.382
I want a detailed
polysomnograph.

09:10.508 --> 09:13.719
If he's having night terrors,
I want to see them.

09:36.868 --> 09:38.994
I usually don't move
during night terrors.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.621
I'm not
restraining you for them.

09:43.583 --> 09:47.127
EEG revealed
abnormalities in your brain,

09:47.254 --> 09:49.505
caused nerve damage
in your toes.

09:55.929 --> 10:00.015
- What are you doing?
- Fixing it.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.101
Can I talk to my parents?

10:02.644 --> 10:06.981
- Oh, they know all about this.
- I'd really like to see them.

10:15.865 --> 10:19.076
Please.
I'd really like them here.

10:21.204 --> 10:23.122
This is gonna hurt, Dan.

10:23.248 --> 10:24.957
Oh. Oh, God.

10:41.641 --> 10:43.475
That's a night terror.

10:55.113 --> 10:59.033
We did a CT, MRI,
CBC, CHEM-7 and chest X-ray.

10:59.159 --> 11:00.159
All the tests
came back normal.

11:00.285 --> 11:01.493
There's nothing to
explain his symptoms.

11:01.619 --> 11:04.121
Okay, but let's pretend
there's something and go from there.

11:04.456 --> 11:06.040
Who sees something
on this MRI?

11:08.293 --> 11:11.420
- No lesions in the white matter.
- No structural abnormalities.

11:11.546 --> 11:13.005
No space-occupying tumors.

11:13.131 --> 11:16.717
He's 16, so he should have
an absolutely pristine brain.

11:16.843 --> 11:19.178
The smallest thing
is abnormal.

11:19.554 --> 11:21.388
Meningeal enhancement.

11:22.140 --> 11:24.808
- My bet is viral meningitis.
- Excellent.

11:25.185 --> 11:26.769
Do you see
what he did there?

11:26.895 --> 11:29.063
Took a small clue
that there's a neurological problem

11:29.189 --> 11:30.314
and wasn't afraid
to run with it.

11:30.440 --> 11:32.900
There's no evidence of meningitis
on that MRI.

11:33.026 --> 11:35.277
No, there's not.
He's completely wrong.

11:35.403 --> 11:36.945
Then what clue are
you talking about?

11:37.072 --> 11:38.781
He knew that
I saw something on the MRI,

11:38.907 --> 11:41.742
so he figured there must be
something there and took a guess.

11:41.868 --> 11:45.245
- Clever, but also pathetic.
- So what did you find?

11:45.955 --> 11:48.707
Take a close look
at the corpus callosum.

11:51.086 --> 11:53.045
Looks okay.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.922
Are we all looking
at the same thing?

11:55.048 --> 11:57.257
Two hundred million
interhemispheric nerve fibers.

11:57.384 --> 12:01.720
The George Washington Bridge between
the left and right side of the brain.

12:01.971 --> 12:02.805
It's subtle.

12:06.684 --> 12:10.312
There's some bowing. There.
An upward arch.

12:10.438 --> 12:13.524
- Are you guessing?
- Yes.

12:13.691 --> 12:16.610
- Too bad. You're right.
- He probably just moved.

12:16.736 --> 12:19.405
Nobody stays perfectly still
for the entire MRI.

12:19.531 --> 12:21.407
Yeah. Probably got restless

12:21.533 --> 12:23.325
and shifted
one hemisphere of his brain

12:23.451 --> 12:26.537
to a more comfortable position.
Something is pushing on it.

12:26.663 --> 12:28.122
If there was bowing,
could be a tumor.

12:28.248 --> 12:30.040
Do you see
a tumor on this MRI?

12:30.166 --> 12:31.917
No, but I don't see
any bowing either.

12:32.043 --> 12:35.170
There's no tumor. Just a blockage
causing pressure causing symptoms.

12:35.296 --> 12:39.091
Today, night terrors.
Tomorrow, he's bleeding out of his eyes.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.552
Get him a radionucleotide
cisternogram.

12:41.678 --> 12:43.512
I guarantee
you'll see a blockage.

12:50.061 --> 12:51.228
Okay.

12:54.816 --> 12:55.816
Easy.

12:55.942 --> 12:57.776
Okay. Squeeze my hand.

13:02.240 --> 13:04.199
All right. Squeeze hard.

13:06.953 --> 13:08.412
All right.

13:15.170 --> 13:18.464
Now I'm injecting a material
that's tagged with a radioisotope.

13:19.424 --> 13:23.093
It's gonna enter your spine
and travel up to your brain.

13:23.636 --> 13:26.513
It'll make you able
to think deep thoughts,

13:26.764 --> 13:28.348
run 100 miles an hour.

13:30.059 --> 13:31.101
Easy.

13:45.283 --> 13:48.410
Their eyes aren't the same color,
but that fleck in the eyes,

13:48.536 --> 13:51.079
that's maybe a 1-in-10 chance
if they're not related?

13:51.206 --> 13:53.499
No. House isn't gonna
pay you based on that.

13:54.876 --> 13:57.336
Any excuse we can give the folks
to justify a DNA test?

13:57.462 --> 13:59.213
We could tell them
he's got Huntington's,

13:59.339 --> 14:02.508
whole family should be tested
or they'll all die.

14:05.136 --> 14:06.345
Hey.

14:07.055 --> 14:08.847
There's a lot of blockage.

14:08.973 --> 14:10.807
I've scheduled him
for surgery.

14:10.934 --> 14:12.643
We're gonna put a shunt
into one of the ventricles

14:12.769 --> 14:14.853
to give the cerebrospinal fluid
an out.

14:14.979 --> 14:17.773
No more pressure,
everything goes back to normal.

14:17.899 --> 14:20.400
He's lucky to have
you as his doctors.

14:28.826 --> 14:32.454
No formula. Just Mommy's healthy,
natural breast milk.

14:33.748 --> 14:35.040
Yummy.

14:35.166 --> 14:38.252
Her whole face just got
swollen like this overnight.

14:40.421 --> 14:41.797
No fever.

14:42.966 --> 14:46.260
Glands normal.
Missing her vaccination dates.

14:46.386 --> 14:47.970
We're not vaccinating.

14:54.435 --> 14:55.477
Think they don't work?

14:55.603 --> 14:57.896
I think some multinational
pharmaceutical company

14:58.022 --> 15:01.108
wants me to think they work,
pad their bottom line.

15:02.819 --> 15:04.152
- May I?
- Sure.

15:10.493 --> 15:13.495
Yeah. All-natural, no dyes
is a good business.

15:13.621 --> 15:15.455
All-natural children's toys.

15:15.582 --> 15:18.542
Toy companies, they don't arbitrarily
mark up their frogs.

15:18.668 --> 15:22.045
They don't lie about how much they
spend on research and development.

15:22.171 --> 15:24.423
The worst that a toy company
could be accused of

15:24.549 --> 15:27.175
is making
a really boring frog.

15:29.929 --> 15:32.472
You know another
really good business?

15:32.724 --> 15:35.183
Teeny, tiny baby coffins.

15:36.936 --> 15:40.647
You can get them in frog green,
fire-engine red. Really.

15:41.608 --> 15:45.527
The antibodies in yummy mummy
only protect the kid for six months,

15:45.653 --> 15:48.113
which is why these companies
think they can gouge you.

15:48.239 --> 15:51.867
They think that you'll spend whatever
they ask to keep your kid alive.

15:51.993 --> 15:53.994
Want to change things?
Prove them wrong.

15:54.120 --> 15:56.455
Few hundred parents like you
decide they'd rather let their kid die

15:56.581 --> 15:58.498
than cough up 40 bucks
for a vaccination,

15:58.625 --> 16:01.335
believe me,
prices will drop really fast.

16:06.549 --> 16:08.050
Tell me what she has.

16:10.970 --> 16:11.970
A cold.

16:13.806 --> 16:15.390
There's a problem.

16:15.516 --> 16:16.850
Complications in surgery?

16:16.976 --> 16:18.268
Surgery went fine.
He's in recovery.

16:18.394 --> 16:20.270
But we took a vial
of CSF and tested it.

16:20.396 --> 16:21.355
Really?

16:21.481 --> 16:22.939
Turns out the bowing
wasn't the cause of his problems.

16:23.066 --> 16:24.066
It was a symptom.

16:24.192 --> 16:26.943
Oligoclonal bands
and increased intrathecal IgG.

16:27.070 --> 16:28.820
Which means
multiple sclerosis.

16:28.946 --> 16:30.864
And the reason it takes
three of you to tell me this?

16:30.990 --> 16:33.158
Because we're having a disagreement
about whether or not it is MS.

16:33.284 --> 16:34.618
No lesions on the MRI.

16:34.744 --> 16:36.370
It's early. He's had the disease
for maybe two weeks.

16:36.496 --> 16:39.289
McDonald criteria requires six months
to make a definitive diagnosis.

16:39.415 --> 16:41.041
Who cares about MacPhearson?

16:41.167 --> 16:43.001
- I hear he tortured kittens.
- McDonald.

16:43.127 --> 16:45.170
Oh, McDonald.
Wonderful doctor, loved kittens.

16:45.296 --> 16:47.881
The VEP indicates
slowing of the brain.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.091
Without the lesions,
we can't be sure.

16:49.217 --> 16:51.593
Well, if it is, it's gone
from 0 to 60 in three weeks,

16:51.719 --> 16:54.137
which would indicate
rapidly progressive MS.

16:54.263 --> 16:55.889
Not the fun MS
with the balloons

16:56.015 --> 16:57.641
and the bike rides
for cripples in wheelchairs.

16:57.767 --> 17:00.602
- We should wait until...
- Start treating him now,

17:00.728 --> 17:02.521
maybe he can walk
for another couple of years,

17:02.647 --> 17:05.023
maybe live for another five.

17:05.149 --> 17:07.317
Break it to the family.
I'm going home.

17:07.443 --> 17:10.195
It'll take months
for a definitive diagnosis.

17:10.321 --> 17:11.655
What'll happen to me?

17:13.199 --> 17:15.951
MS is an incredibly
variable disease.

17:16.077 --> 17:19.204
If it is MS,
and we're not 100% sure.

17:19.330 --> 17:21.790
What do you think
is gonna happen?

17:24.961 --> 17:27.003
There are some medications
to manage the symptoms,

17:27.130 --> 17:31.174
but as the disease progresses,
the problems will become more severe.

17:31.300 --> 17:33.218
Bowel and bladder
dysfunction,

17:33.344 --> 17:35.470
loss of cognitive function,
pain...

17:35.596 --> 17:37.013
So it's gonna hurt?

17:39.183 --> 17:41.727
The brain's like
a big jumble of wires.

17:41.853 --> 17:44.896
MS strips them of the insulation,
and the nerves die.

17:45.022 --> 17:47.065
Brain interprets it as pain.

17:47.191 --> 17:51.194
But by starting treatment, we're gonna
prevent that for as long as possible.

17:51.320 --> 17:52.946
We're looking into
a couple of specialists,

17:53.072 --> 17:56.825
and until we get you squared away,
you'll stay here, okay?

18:17.555 --> 18:20.140
Security checked the videotapes
from all perimeter cameras.

18:20.266 --> 18:21.266
He's still gotta be
in the hospital.

18:21.392 --> 18:22.350
Where's Chase?

18:22.477 --> 18:23.643
- Main floor.
- Okay.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.145
You take the cafeteria
and administration.

18:25.271 --> 18:27.606
I'll hit the research annex
and work my way back to you.

19:05.436 --> 19:06.603
Dan?

19:12.819 --> 19:14.903
I'm not here. Leave a message.

19:20.576 --> 19:23.328
Dr. Cuddy. Great outfit.

19:23.454 --> 19:25.539
What are you doing back here?
Patient?

19:25.665 --> 19:26.998
No. Hooker.

19:27.124 --> 19:28.917
Went to my office
instead of my home.

19:39.804 --> 19:41.012
Dr. House.

19:41.931 --> 19:43.139
Dan's missing.

19:43.266 --> 19:44.975
Yeah. I got that part
from the message.

19:45.101 --> 19:46.059
You said I was
needed immediately.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.061
He shouldn't move
after a lumbar puncture.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.939
I agree. He's gonna have
a very nasty headache.

19:51.065 --> 19:53.900
That would also be my opinion
if consulted tomorrow morning.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.402
We wanted to
keep you informed.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.946
He heard some
pretty heavy news.

19:59.073 --> 20:01.700
This is not a toddler
wandering around a department store.

20:01.826 --> 20:03.952
He's 16. You'll find him.

20:05.079 --> 20:06.705
I'm going home.

20:07.623 --> 20:09.916
When you say, "Call me if you need
anything", you mean, "Don't call"?

20:10.042 --> 20:12.294
No, I mean call me
if I could do something.

20:12.420 --> 20:13.503
I'm bad at search parties,

20:13.629 --> 20:16.715
and I'm bad at sitting around
looking nervous, doing nothing.

20:16.841 --> 20:18.633
What about his parents?
Should we call them?

20:18.759 --> 20:21.136
Why? Do you think
they're hiding him?

20:21.971 --> 20:23.972
Make sure someone
checks the roof.

20:24.098 --> 20:28.268
Some of the orderlies keep the door
propped open so they can grab a smoke.

21:03.054 --> 21:04.888
Dan. You okay?

21:12.313 --> 21:14.564
There are
experimental treatments.

21:14.690 --> 21:15.899
Ongoing research.

21:16.567 --> 21:18.944
Who knows what they'll discover
in a year or two.

21:19.070 --> 21:20.862
This is where
I dropped the ball.

21:20.988 --> 21:24.074
Dan, we're standing
on the roof of the hospital.

21:25.993 --> 21:27.077
Dan.

21:28.079 --> 21:29.996
Dan, you're
not on the field.

21:30.873 --> 21:32.666
- He doesn't know where he is.
- Dan!

21:32.792 --> 21:33.875
Foreman.

21:35.378 --> 21:36.544
Dan.

21:38.172 --> 21:39.756
- Dan?
- Dan, no!

21:51.227 --> 21:52.686
Dr. Foreman.

21:54.605 --> 21:56.314
I assume
you found the kid.

21:56.440 --> 21:58.942
- He almost walked off the roof.
- Suicidal?

21:59.068 --> 22:01.236
No, he thought he was
on his lacrosse field.

22:01.362 --> 22:03.321
Look, I was just gonna run home,
shower, change...

22:03.447 --> 22:05.323
- Conscious?
- Yeah.

22:06.701 --> 22:07.742
How'd you talk him down?

22:07.868 --> 22:10.996
- Actually, Chase tackled him.
- How come you didn't do it?

22:11.122 --> 22:13.498
Right. Well, I am black,
but he was closer.

22:16.669 --> 22:18.920
Come on.
You can ride up with me.

22:24.760 --> 22:27.178
Anybody tell the family that their boy
almost stepped off a roof?

22:27.304 --> 22:28.346
They must be thrilled.

22:28.472 --> 22:31.057
They're not suing,
but I think only because Chase asked...

22:31.183 --> 22:33.184
Why does everybody
always think I'm being sarcastic?

22:33.310 --> 22:36.396
This is great news.
He doesn't have MS.

22:36.522 --> 22:38.648
Parents should be thrilled.
Well, the mom anyway.

22:38.774 --> 22:39.899
Of course, the dad
probably doesn't know...

22:40.026 --> 22:41.568
Why doesn't he have MS?

22:41.694 --> 22:43.737
He was on the roof,
thinking he was on a lacrosse field.

22:43.863 --> 22:45.155
Conscious, and
therefore not a night terror.

22:45.281 --> 22:47.657
- You want some of this?
- Yeah, sure.

22:48.075 --> 22:50.201
He was in an acute
confusional state,

22:50.327 --> 22:52.662
which doesn't fit with
a demyelinating disease like MS.

22:52.788 --> 22:53.788
Oligoclonal bands...

22:53.914 --> 22:55.040
Were real.

22:55.166 --> 22:56.958
They just mean
something other than MS.

22:57.084 --> 22:58.752
So, what are they telling us?

22:58.878 --> 23:00.003
That the immune system
is working?

23:00.129 --> 23:01.171
Right.

23:01.297 --> 23:02.964
He has
an infection in his brain.

23:03.090 --> 23:06.718
- What about sex?
- Well, it might get complicated.

23:06.844 --> 23:07.886
I mean, we work together.

23:08.012 --> 23:09.429
I'm older, certainly,
but maybe you like that.

23:09.555 --> 23:11.264
I meant maybe he
has neurosyphilis.

23:12.141 --> 23:13.141
Nice cover.

23:13.267 --> 23:14.517
Sorry. RPR was negative.

23:14.643 --> 23:16.352
We don't need
a definitive test to confirm this.

23:16.479 --> 23:18.271
Sure. Didn't need
one to confirm MS.

23:18.397 --> 23:20.982
Okay. Let's wait for you to
run titers on 1,400 viruses

23:21.108 --> 23:23.026
while this kid's
brain turns to mush.

23:23.152 --> 23:24.944
So the fact that
he doesn't have MS,

23:25.071 --> 23:27.030
it's really not
good news after all.

23:27.156 --> 23:28.990
Well, it is if
it's neurosyphilis.

23:29.116 --> 23:32.118
The likelihood of
a false negative on an RPR test, 30%.

23:32.244 --> 23:35.872
Likelihood of a 16-year-old having sex,
roughly 120%.

23:35.998 --> 23:37.040
I'll start him
on IV penicillin.

23:37.166 --> 23:38.166
No. We're not
gonna wait for that.

23:38.292 --> 23:39.876
The most effective way
to deliver the drug

23:40.002 --> 23:41.294
is right into his
brain via the spine.

23:41.420 --> 23:43.379
We can't. In a cramped
space like the brain,

23:43.506 --> 23:46.257
increased intracranial pressure
from a high-volume drug like penicillin

23:46.383 --> 23:48.676
could herniate his brain stem.
It'd kill him.

23:48.803 --> 23:50.804
No neurologist in his right mind
would recommend that.

23:50.930 --> 23:53.681
Show of hands.
Who thinks I'm not in my right mind?

23:54.391 --> 23:57.644
And who thinks I forget
this fairly basic neurological fact?

23:58.270 --> 24:00.772
Who thinks
there's a third option?

24:02.191 --> 24:04.109
Very good.
What's the third choice?

24:04.235 --> 24:07.278
No idea. You just asked
if I thought there was one.

24:09.740 --> 24:11.491
The patient has
a shunt in his brain.

24:11.617 --> 24:12.784
There'll be no
increased pressure.

24:12.910 --> 24:15.203
We can put as much penicillin
into his body as we want.

24:15.329 --> 24:18.164
Excellent.
Inject him through a lumbar puncture.

24:21.168 --> 24:25.463
One of us is gonna do this to you
twice a day for the next two weeks.

24:27.633 --> 24:28.633
I'm ready. Go.

24:28.759 --> 24:32.387
He could get syphilis
even if he's not sexually active?

24:33.389 --> 24:36.850
Well, it's unusual,
but it's possible.

24:37.810 --> 24:39.727
Okay. Relax.

24:52.783 --> 24:56.077
It's infected,
with a really big hole,

24:56.203 --> 24:58.538
like you stuck a nail in it
to relieve the pressure.

24:58.664 --> 24:59.622
I wouldn't do that.

24:59.748 --> 25:00.790
Although
the wound is irregular.

25:00.916 --> 25:02.917
It's not cylindrical.
It's shaped like a triangle.

25:03.043 --> 25:05.211
So, not a nail.

25:05.337 --> 25:07.255
- Steak knife?
- Wife's nail file.

25:07.381 --> 25:08.965
Nail file.

25:09.800 --> 25:12.594
Yeah. Pain will make
you do stupid things.

25:13.012 --> 25:14.888
Something to
take the edge off?

25:15.014 --> 25:15.889
Yeah.

25:18.434 --> 25:19.809
Cheers.

25:24.148 --> 25:26.941
So, you have family
here in Princeton?

25:27.067 --> 25:28.109
No.

25:29.028 --> 25:30.028
Here on work?

25:30.154 --> 25:31.863
- No. Why are you...
- Does your penis hurt?

25:31.989 --> 25:34.240
No. What? Should it?

25:34.366 --> 25:38.077
No. Just thought I'd toss you
a really inappropriate question.

25:38.204 --> 25:39.412
Your lawyer's gonna love it.

25:39.538 --> 25:40.705
Why would I want
to sue you?

25:40.831 --> 25:41.789
I want you to treat me.

25:41.916 --> 25:42.957
You're from Maplewood,
New Jersey, right?

25:43.083 --> 25:44.083
Yeah.

25:44.210 --> 25:46.920
Now, why would you
drive 70 miles

25:47.046 --> 25:47.921
to get treatment
for a condition

25:48.047 --> 25:50.715
that a nine-year-old
could diagnose?

25:51.884 --> 25:54.302
It's the free-flowing pus
that's the tip-off.

25:54.428 --> 25:55.386
I was in town.

25:55.512 --> 25:57.347
Not for family.
Not for work.

25:57.473 --> 25:59.432
You drove 70 miles
to a walk-in clinic.

25:59.558 --> 26:00.850
You passed two hospitals
on the road.

26:00.976 --> 26:03.186
Now, either you've got a problem
with those hospitals,

26:03.312 --> 26:04.437
or they have
a problem with you.

26:04.563 --> 26:07.232
My guess is you've sued
half the doctors in Maplewood,

26:07.358 --> 26:09.067
and the rest are now
refusing to help you.

26:09.193 --> 26:10.443
It's ironic, isn't it?

26:10.569 --> 26:13.112
Sort of like
the boy who sued wolf.

26:13.697 --> 26:16.115
You know, I bet we have
a doctor here named Wolf.

26:16.242 --> 26:18.201
How perfect would that be?

26:18.744 --> 26:19.744
I'm gonna page him.

26:19.870 --> 26:21.037
Okay. You know what?
Thank you.

26:21.163 --> 26:23.539
I'm gonna find a doctor
to take care of this.

26:23.666 --> 26:25.667
I didn't say
I wouldn't treat you.

26:25.793 --> 26:27.919
We'll drain your knee,
run some lab work. Fix you right up.

26:28.045 --> 26:30.755
- Why would you do that?
- I'm a people person.

26:32.091 --> 26:33.508
You actually treated him?

26:33.634 --> 26:35.009
All I know is
he sued some doctors.

26:35.135 --> 26:37.679
Who am I to assume
they didn't have it coming to them?

26:37.805 --> 26:39.555
The cutest
little tennis outfit.

26:39.682 --> 26:41.641
My God, I thought
I was gonna have a heart attack.

26:41.767 --> 26:43.643
Oh, my. I didn't see you there.
That is so embarrassing.

26:43.769 --> 26:45.103
How's your hooker doing?

26:45.229 --> 26:46.980
Sweet of you to ask.
Funny story.

26:47.106 --> 26:48.564
She was gonna be
hospital administrator,

26:48.691 --> 26:50.858
but just hated having to
screw people like that.

26:50.985 --> 26:51.985
I heard you found
her on the roof.

26:52.111 --> 26:55.154
- You have very acute hearing.
- You notify the parents?

26:55.281 --> 26:56.406
In due course, of course.

26:56.532 --> 27:00.702
And is there a paternity bet
on the father of the patient?

27:00.828 --> 27:01.828
Doesn't sound like me.

27:01.954 --> 27:04.122
Well, it does, actually,
but doesn't mean you're guilty.

27:04.248 --> 27:06.457
- You think?
- I saw the parents in the lobby.

27:06.583 --> 27:09.127
Smart money's
obviously on the father.

27:09.253 --> 27:11.421
My guy knows a guy
who can get you in for 50 bucks.

27:11.547 --> 27:13.256
Fine.
Tell your guy, if I win,

27:13.382 --> 27:15.258
you attend the faculty symposium,
and you wear a tie.

27:15.384 --> 27:18.720
And if I win,
no clinic hours for a week.

27:18.846 --> 27:20.847
My guy will call your guy.

27:22.725 --> 27:24.851
She's very good at her job.

27:29.356 --> 27:31.566
The treatments
should start helping soon.

27:31.692 --> 27:35.653
Let us know if it gets easier
to focus on things, remember stuff.

27:36.905 --> 27:38.031
Hey, Dan.

27:38.157 --> 27:40.783
Isn't Dr. Cameron's necklace
a beauty?

27:40.909 --> 27:43.036
Something South American,
I think.

27:43.162 --> 27:44.912
Yeah. Guatemalan.

27:45.956 --> 27:47.957
It's a cool necklace.

27:49.585 --> 27:52.170
- Thank you so much.
- The kid's in pain.

27:54.131 --> 27:55.673
Don't fight it.
Just let it happen.

27:55.799 --> 27:56.758
No.

27:56.884 --> 27:58.051
- You'll be dead in two days.
- "No" what?

27:58.177 --> 27:59.135
I give it a day.

27:59.261 --> 28:00.970
Dan? You okay?

28:01.096 --> 28:02.388
- Dan?
- Night terrors.

28:02.514 --> 28:04.849
Body decomposition
once he's in the grave.

28:04.975 --> 28:06.267
Say goodbye to
your mother and father.

28:06.393 --> 28:07.393
He's hearing voices.

28:07.519 --> 28:09.979
You're dying.
It's all over, Dan.

28:11.982 --> 28:13.024
You're dying.
Dying. Dead!

28:13.150 --> 28:15.068
You're a dead man!

28:15.944 --> 28:17.987
Push 2 milligrams
IV Ativan, stat.

28:18.113 --> 28:19.947
It's all over.

28:20.282 --> 28:21.449
Come on, Dan.

28:21.575 --> 28:23.117
Get out of my head!

28:25.996 --> 28:28.581
Auditory hallucination shows
further brain degeneration.

28:28.707 --> 28:29.916
Penicillin's
not working.

28:30.042 --> 28:32.835
So either it's a
bad batch of penicillin,

28:32.961 --> 28:34.796
or our diagnosis
is wrong.

28:36.423 --> 28:39.425
Square one. MIDNIT.

28:39.551 --> 28:42.553
LFTs, BUN and
creatinine are all normal.

28:42.679 --> 28:43.805
Diabetes is out,
and no gap.

28:43.931 --> 28:46.474
- There goes metabolic.
- MRA rules out vasculitis.

28:46.600 --> 28:47.850
"I" for inflammation.

28:47.976 --> 28:49.268
Too young for
anything degenerative.

28:49.395 --> 28:50.853
"D", see ya.

28:50.979 --> 28:53.398
- "N" for neoplastic.
- MRI was clean.

28:54.691 --> 28:56.609
- "I" for inflammation.
- We already did that.

28:56.735 --> 28:59.028
Stupid to have two I's in one mnemonic.
What's the other one?

28:59.154 --> 28:59.987
Infection.

29:00.114 --> 29:01.489
Oligoclonal bands
still have to mean something.

29:01.615 --> 29:02.657
But no fevers.

29:02.783 --> 29:04.075
White count's elevated,
but within range.

29:04.201 --> 29:06.994
We've tested for anything remotely
possible. Everything's negative.

29:07.121 --> 29:08.663
CT scan rules out subdural.

29:08.831 --> 29:10.415
Trauma. Later much.

29:16.046 --> 29:17.255
You know the problem?

29:17.381 --> 29:20.800
"Midnight" is actually spelled
with a "G" and an "H".

29:21.135 --> 29:24.720
If we could just figure out
what those letters stand for.

29:27.975 --> 29:31.060
It's a sick brain,
having fun,

29:33.105 --> 29:35.773
torturing him,
talking to him.

29:40.946 --> 29:42.864
Scaring the hell out of him.

29:45.117 --> 29:49.370
Get him an EEG, left and right EOG,
esophageal microphones.

29:50.122 --> 29:53.875
If this thing wants
to talk, let's listen.

29:56.003 --> 29:59.964
We're missing something.
This is screwed up.

30:00.090 --> 30:03.885
That's why you came up with the brain
talking to the virus thing?

30:04.011 --> 30:06.095
I panicked, okay?

30:06.221 --> 30:08.681
Sounded cool, though.
They bought it.

30:12.352 --> 30:13.478
Crap.

30:14.021 --> 30:16.022
Another reason I don't
like meeting patients.

30:16.148 --> 30:19.025
If they don't know what you look like,
they can't yell at you.

30:19.151 --> 30:20.568
Here we go.

30:25.324 --> 30:27.450
How can you just sit there?

30:28.577 --> 30:29.994
If I eat standing up,
I spill.

30:30.120 --> 30:33.331
Our son is dying,
and you could care less?

30:34.124 --> 30:37.168
We're going through hell.
You're doing nothing?

30:38.504 --> 30:40.630
I'm sorry.
You need to vent. I understand.

30:40.756 --> 30:42.590
Don't be condescending.

30:43.091 --> 30:45.718
You haven't
checked in on him once.

30:45.928 --> 30:47.970
Blood pressure
is 110 over 70.

30:48.764 --> 30:51.182
His shunt is patent, well-placed
in the right lateral ventricle.

30:51.308 --> 30:53.059
The EKG shows a normal QRS

30:53.185 --> 30:55.937
with deep-wave inversions throughout
both limb and precordial leads.

30:56.063 --> 30:58.981
LFTs are elevated,
but only twice the normal range.

30:59.107 --> 31:01.400
Oh, yeah.
And he's hearing voices.

31:06.532 --> 31:08.115
Go hold his hand.

31:10.160 --> 31:12.245
Go on. I'll bus your tray.

31:25.842 --> 31:27.677
Got any sample bags on you?

31:27.803 --> 31:30.846
I don't believe you.
You're gonna run DNA tests?

31:30.973 --> 31:34.308
Their son is deathly ill.
I know. It's terrible.

31:34.434 --> 31:35.768
But the fact is,
if I don't keep busy

31:35.894 --> 31:38.229
with trivial things like this,
I'm afraid I might start to cry.

31:38.355 --> 31:39.480
You're an ass.

31:39.606 --> 31:41.816
Yeah?
You want to double the bet?

31:52.911 --> 31:55.705
General Hospital
is on Channel 6.

31:55.831 --> 31:58.833
Dan's brain's not showing
Channel 6 right now. Only mush.

31:58.959 --> 32:00.960
No epileptiform activity.

32:02.879 --> 32:03.921
What are you doing?

32:04.047 --> 32:07.758
- Waiting for CBC and CHEM-7.
- Good. Run DNA on these.

32:10.804 --> 32:13.222
- What's this?
- Parents' coffee cups.

32:14.641 --> 32:15.641
I can't believe you.

32:15.767 --> 32:16.934
I've had this
conversation once already.

32:17.060 --> 32:20.021
If you've got something else to do,
do it. Otherwise, do this.

32:28.155 --> 32:29.780
Dr. House?

32:29.906 --> 32:31.157
Hey. Mr. Funsten.

32:31.325 --> 32:32.867
I was wondering
when you'd be back.

32:32.993 --> 32:34.577
You got some papers for me?

32:34.703 --> 32:36.704
You've caused me
considerable mental distress.

32:36.830 --> 32:38.497
I certainly hope so.

32:39.041 --> 32:41.500
What? Too cheap to get your lawyer
to serve it for you,

32:41.627 --> 32:42.877
or is it just
more fun this way?

32:43.003 --> 32:45.087
I'm obviously prepared
to consider a settlement.

32:45.213 --> 32:46.881
You have gonorrhea.

32:49.426 --> 32:50.551
No, I don't.

32:50.677 --> 32:53.304
Well, maybe you're right,
but I have a lab result says you do.

32:53.430 --> 32:55.890
Could be a false positive,
and normally I'd run a second test,

32:56.016 --> 32:57.558
but since you're here,
I'll just go with the first.

32:57.684 --> 32:58.851
You're just
trying to scare me.

32:58.977 --> 33:01.020
It's reportable, you know.
Public health issue.

33:01.146 --> 33:02.897
I'll be sure to
let my wife know.

33:03.023 --> 33:04.982
Don't bother yourself.
The state will call for you.

33:05.108 --> 33:08.069
Look, if you're clean, I'm
sure it'll all blow over. No big deal.

33:08.195 --> 33:09.362
There's an easy
way to find out.

33:09.488 --> 33:11.447
Get one of your
doctors to run a test.

33:13.450 --> 33:14.450
Uh-uh.

33:15.202 --> 33:17.995
These are mine now.
I'll see you in court.

33:22.209 --> 33:25.294
West Nile, negative. Not
surprising since not too many mosquitoes

33:25.420 --> 33:26.754
passing through
Jersey in December.

33:26.880 --> 33:27.922
No eastern
equine encephalitis.

33:28.048 --> 33:29.298
You guys aren't
gonna believe this.

33:29.424 --> 33:30.466
What's that?

33:30.592 --> 33:33.010
House is right.
The father's not the father.

33:34.471 --> 33:36.263
Dude doubled up on me.

33:36.932 --> 33:39.058
You're not
gonna believe this.

33:39.184 --> 33:41.018
The mother's not
the mother either.

33:43.522 --> 33:46.273
It's not a good idea
to move your son in his condition.

33:46.400 --> 33:48.693
- We just want a second opinion.
- We need an answer.

33:50.195 --> 33:53.155
You idiots.
You lied to me.

33:53.281 --> 33:55.074
We didn't lie
about anything.

33:55.200 --> 33:58.035
You, on the other hand,
accused us of molesting our son.

33:58.161 --> 34:00.079
- Perfect.
- Can we get off my screw-ups

34:00.205 --> 34:02.164
and focus on theirs?
Theirs is bigger.

34:02.290 --> 34:04.917
- You're not Dan's parents.
- We're his parents.

34:05.043 --> 34:06.544
He was adopted.
He doesn't need to know.

34:06.670 --> 34:07.628
I do.

34:07.754 --> 34:09.171
Adoption makes
us just as much...

34:09.297 --> 34:13.175
Listen. When we were taking
his medical history, were you confused?

34:13.343 --> 34:15.678
Did you think we were looking
for a genetic clue to his condition,

34:15.804 --> 34:17.096
or did you think we were
trying to ascertain

34:17.222 --> 34:19.849
who loves him the most
in the whole wide world?

34:19.975 --> 34:22.101
How did you find
out about this?

34:22.853 --> 34:25.896
- I sampled their DNA.
- We didn't give you any DNA.

34:26.022 --> 34:27.982
Your coffee cups
from the cafeteria.

34:28.108 --> 34:29.400
You can't do that.

34:29.526 --> 34:31.986
Again, why are we getting hung up
on what I did?

34:32.112 --> 34:33.529
Your medical
history is useless.

34:33.655 --> 34:37.867
No. We gave you a detailed history
of his biological mother.

34:38.118 --> 34:41.162
Her history.
Non-smoker, good health,

34:41.288 --> 34:44.081
low cholesterol,
no blood pressure problems.

34:44.207 --> 34:46.125
Dan was adopted two weeks
after he was born.

34:46.251 --> 34:47.793
You have his history.
There's nothing you need to know

34:47.919 --> 34:50.087
- that we didn't tell you.
- Sounds reasonable.

34:50.714 --> 34:54.049
Well, if you want to transfer your boy,
that is your choice.

34:54.176 --> 34:55.301
I still think
it's the wrong...

34:55.427 --> 34:57.136
Was she vaccinated?

34:58.346 --> 34:59.764
The biological mother.

34:59.890 --> 35:01.474
When she was a baby,
did she get her vaccinations?

35:01.600 --> 35:04.185
Dan was vaccinated
at six months.

35:05.604 --> 35:08.856
Do you know why kids get
vaccinated at six months?

35:08.982 --> 35:10.441
Because before that
they are protected

35:10.567 --> 35:13.903
by their biological
mother's immune system.

35:14.029 --> 35:16.238
So, was she vaccinated?

35:19.785 --> 35:22.912
An infant picks up
a regular old measles virus.

35:23.288 --> 35:26.040
Gets a rash.
He's extremely uncomfortable,

35:26.166 --> 35:28.292
has a wicked fever,
but he lives.

35:28.418 --> 35:29.835
Here's the kicker.

35:29.961 --> 35:33.631
Once every million or so times,
the virus mutates.

35:34.633 --> 35:37.218
Instead of Dan having
a fever and a rash,

35:37.344 --> 35:41.305
the virus travels to his brain
and hides, like a time bomb.

35:41.932 --> 35:44.809
In this case, for 16 years.

35:44.935 --> 35:47.603
Subacute
sclerosing panencephalitis.

35:48.313 --> 35:50.147
I know.
There's only been 20 cases

35:50.273 --> 35:51.816
in the United States
in the last 30 years.

35:51.942 --> 35:55.236
I suppose you could make an argument
the kid's still in Stage 1.

35:55.362 --> 35:57.446
Once SSPE moves
to Stage 2, it's...

35:57.572 --> 36:00.866
Boom.
Stage 2 is universally fatal.

36:00.992 --> 36:01.951
I assume it's
impossible to know

36:02.077 --> 36:03.494
when he might
move into Stage 2.

36:03.620 --> 36:05.663
He's already
started showing symptoms.

36:05.789 --> 36:07.998
Could be a month.
Could be tonight.

36:08.375 --> 36:10.251
- Can we treat it?
- Ask the neurologist.

36:10.377 --> 36:12.586
Intraventricular interferon.

36:12.712 --> 36:14.004
Not gonna shove
a spike into his brain

36:14.130 --> 36:16.757
and drip interferon
without confirming this diagnosis.

36:16.883 --> 36:18.926
- Tap him.
- We won't get a reliable result

36:19.052 --> 36:20.594
for measles antibodies
in his CSF.

36:20.720 --> 36:21.762
Not after everything
we've given him.

36:21.888 --> 36:24.974
So the wrong treatment kills any hope
of the right diagnosis.

36:25.100 --> 36:27.017
Why do people lie to me?

36:29.145 --> 36:31.981
Could also kill him.
Your ball, Foreman.

36:32.107 --> 36:34.066
Tell me I don't have
to biopsy his brain.

36:35.986 --> 36:38.112
Well, there is one other way.

36:39.781 --> 36:41.824
You sure
this isn't gonna hurt?

36:41.950 --> 36:43.993
Yeah.
It's just scary as hell.

36:44.411 --> 36:45.995
See,
we go through the pupil.

36:46.121 --> 36:48.622
But you won't feel it.
The eye's been paralyzed.

36:48.748 --> 36:50.416
The needle travels to
the back of the eye,

36:50.542 --> 36:53.794
which is where we'll perform
the biopsy on your retina.

36:59.009 --> 37:02.177
So we've confirmed that the problem
is this mutated virus.

37:02.429 --> 37:05.848
The treatment for SSPE is
intraventricular interferon.

37:05.974 --> 37:08.976
We implant an Ommaya reservoir
under the scalp,

37:09.102 --> 37:10.853
which is connected to
a ventricular catheter

37:10.979 --> 37:13.939
that delivers the antiviral
directly to the left hemisphere.

37:14.065 --> 37:15.399
You want us to consent
to this?

37:15.525 --> 37:17.234
I don't even understand
what you're talking about.

37:17.360 --> 37:19.194
Well, the antiviral...

37:22.824 --> 37:24.325
Look. I'm sorry.

37:24.451 --> 37:26.493
I can explain this
as best I can,

37:26.620 --> 37:29.538
but the notion that you're gonna
fully understand your son's treatment

37:29.664 --> 37:33.000
and make an informed decision
is kind of insane.

37:35.045 --> 37:37.296
Here's what
you need to know.

37:38.089 --> 37:41.800
It's dangerous.
It could kill him.

37:42.844 --> 37:44.386
You should do it.

37:55.649 --> 37:57.816
Did you
need something else?

38:16.753 --> 38:19.964
You can't order a $3,200 DNA test
to win a bet.

38:20.090 --> 38:22.049
It's not an actual cost.

38:22.467 --> 38:23.509
I don't know
if you know this,

38:23.635 --> 38:26.011
but the hospital actually owns
the sequencing machine.

38:26.137 --> 38:27.262
- I'm serious.
- Tell the parents

38:27.389 --> 38:28.722
to submit
the bill to insurance.

38:28.848 --> 38:30.933
Insurance is not
gonna pay for a bet.

38:31.059 --> 38:32.017
It should.

38:32.143 --> 38:34.061
We don't make that bet,
the kid dies.

38:34.980 --> 38:37.398
If not for the paternity bet,
I never would have taken their DNA.

38:37.524 --> 38:39.024
Without their DNA,
we never would have discovered

38:39.150 --> 38:42.361
that Dan was adopted,
which was the key to this case.

38:42.904 --> 38:45.364
You just don't
want to pay your end.

38:45.782 --> 38:48.033
Big mistake.
My guy knows a guy.

38:48.159 --> 38:51.203
Fine. I will let you
out of clinic duty for one week,

38:51.329 --> 38:54.289
after you pay
the $3,200 for the PCR test.

39:03.925 --> 39:06.760
Well, now,
there's the $100 you owe me.

39:08.138 --> 39:10.264
Here's the $100
I won from Cameron.

39:10.390 --> 39:12.808
$200 I took off of Foreman.

39:14.144 --> 39:17.771
And $600 I got from Wilson.

39:20.859 --> 39:21.900
Very bitter.

39:25.947 --> 39:27.573
Hey. Good morning.

39:27.991 --> 39:29.575
Good news
on your EEG.

39:29.701 --> 39:30.951
Treatment is working.

39:31.077 --> 39:33.037
And your immune system
is responding.

39:33.747 --> 39:36.999
I know it's early,
but I just want to take a look.

39:38.084 --> 39:39.418
All right.

39:39.544 --> 39:41.920
Let's see what that
brain of yours can do.

39:42.047 --> 39:43.380
Name as many
animals as you can

39:43.506 --> 39:45.299
that start with
the letter "O".

39:46.092 --> 39:47.384
Ostrich.

39:48.386 --> 39:51.096
Ox. Old elephant.

39:51.806 --> 39:54.475
Well, that's two
better than last time.

39:54.851 --> 39:57.352
How you doing
with the whole adoption thing?

39:57.479 --> 39:58.854
I knew since fifth grade.

39:59.731 --> 40:00.898
How's that?

40:01.024 --> 40:02.274
Cleft chin.

40:03.693 --> 40:06.195
I have one.
My dad doesn't.

40:06.905 --> 40:07.821
Looked it up
on the Internet.

40:07.947 --> 40:10.532
It's one of
those trait things.

40:10.658 --> 40:13.202
That's right.
It's autosomal dominant.

40:13.828 --> 40:15.954
Since neither of your parents
have cleft chins,

40:16.081 --> 40:19.041
it's highly unlikely
you're biologically related.

40:21.002 --> 40:22.461
Are you sure you're okay?

40:22.587 --> 40:25.005
I've got no problems
with being adopted.

40:26.382 --> 40:27.966
I love my parents.

40:31.096 --> 40:32.096
How's he doing?

40:32.222 --> 40:35.140
He's doing pretty well.
He's a smart kid.

40:35.850 --> 40:37.184
I think he's gonna be fine.

40:41.189 --> 40:43.065
- Hey.
- Thanks.

41:19.102 --> 41:21.186
Wheels, 18. Wheels.
