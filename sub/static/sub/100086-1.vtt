00:01.097 --> 00:03.562
<i>Back in the '80s,
National Lampoon's Vacation</i>

00:03.650 --> 00:05.953
<i>was the best
road-trip comedy ever.</i>

00:06.072 --> 00:08.721
<i>Yep, the Griswold family
tore across America,</i>

00:08.809 --> 00:11.125
<i>and no one loved it
more than my mom.</i>

00:11.281 --> 00:14.653
Yes! This movie has everything
I love and deserve!

00:14.748 --> 00:17.263
So pack your bags
so I can unpack them

00:17.351 --> 00:18.932
and then repack them
again properly

00:19.019 --> 00:22.403
because the Goldbergs
are going on vacation!

00:22.490 --> 00:23.637
I don't know, Mom.

00:23.724 --> 00:26.073
That family's trip seemed
super stressful and difficult.

00:26.160 --> 00:27.474
And they
like each other.

00:27.561 --> 00:29.068
But we have one week left

00:29.156 --> 00:31.545
before Barry and Erica
jet off to college.

00:31.632 --> 00:32.713
It's 10 minutes away.

00:32.800 --> 00:33.914
On nice days,
I might walk.

00:34.001 --> 00:36.820
And Adam's starting life as
a high-school upperclassman.

00:36.908 --> 00:38.804
Now when the juniors
throw food at me...

00:39.132 --> 00:40.121
..they'll be my peers.

00:40.208 --> 00:42.203
- Such a dork.
- You shame us daily.

00:42.291 --> 00:45.810
So we're gonna take one last
unforgettable family vacation

00:45.898 --> 00:48.872
before everybody starts the
next big chapter in their lives!

00:48.960 --> 00:49.859
What do you say?

00:49.947 --> 00:51.595
We love you,
but pass.

00:51.698 --> 00:54.664
You're gonna pass
on a trip to Disneyland?

00:54.752 --> 00:57.035
- Oh, balls!
- I love you now!

00:57.123 --> 00:59.276
Ah, that's right!
Embrace your mama!

00:59.364 --> 01:00.909
Star Wars just opened
a ride there!

01:00.997 --> 01:02.109
It's called "Star Tours"!

01:02.196 --> 01:04.078
You get to travel to the
forest moon of Endor!

01:04.165 --> 01:06.447
Well, I "Endor" you.
Boop!

01:06.534 --> 01:07.997
Even you can't ruin this.

01:08.085 --> 01:10.901
Star Wars teaming up with
Disney is just so big!

01:10.989 --> 01:13.486
Sure, I wish they'd dedicate
a whole land to Star Wars,

01:13.574 --> 01:15.716
but that's just
a little boy's dream!

01:16.466 --> 01:17.491
Barry?

01:17.578 --> 01:20.294
Wanna give mama a huggy 'cause
she's the best in the game?

01:20.381 --> 01:22.229
I'm not going
to Disneyland!

01:22.317 --> 01:24.755
I'm a grown adult man
who will be starting

01:24.843 --> 01:26.799
a fully accredited
university in a week.

01:26.887 --> 01:28.917
But you love
that Snow White.

01:29.005 --> 01:31.424
You've had a crush on her
since you could talk.

01:31.512 --> 01:32.979
Which was late
for your age.

01:33.067 --> 01:33.640
But still.

01:33.727 --> 01:35.401
Sure, Ms. White
has pretty hair

01:35.489 --> 01:37.276
and she's... patient
with those dwarves

01:37.364 --> 01:38.816
in a way you know
you'd just vibe with her,

01:38.903 --> 01:39.880
but not at all!

01:39.967 --> 01:40.755
Who cares!

01:40.843 --> 01:42.794
I can't believe
we're flying to California!

01:42.882 --> 01:44.850
Oh, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no!

01:44.938 --> 01:46.481
That won't
give me enough time

01:46.584 --> 01:48.567
squished together
with my squishies.

01:48.660 --> 01:49.688
We're driving!

01:49.776 --> 01:52.091
To the airport
and then we're flying?

01:52.179 --> 01:53.493
When will I learn
not to hug

01:53.581 --> 01:54.934
until I hear
all of the details?

01:55.022 --> 01:57.698
It'll be just like the Griswolds.
We're gonna see America!

01:57.785 --> 01:59.916
This America?
I've seen it.

02:00.004 --> 02:01.201
It's all corn.

02:01.289 --> 02:04.705
Look, I just finished following the
Grateful Dead in a van with Geoff.

02:04.792 --> 02:06.707
- I'm not going back out there.
- Me neither!

02:06.794 --> 02:08.661
If you don't,
I won't pay for college.

02:08.771 --> 02:10.053
Yay, everyone's in!

02:10.163 --> 02:11.223
What's all the noise?

02:11.311 --> 02:13.377
I can barely hear myself
eat my creme cookies.

02:13.465 --> 02:15.148
We're driving
to Disneyland!

02:15.236 --> 02:17.083
I get the feeling
I don't have a say in this.

02:17.171 --> 02:18.985
Hmm, I get that
feeling, too! Yay!

02:19.073 --> 02:20.155
Why did I come in here?

02:20.243 --> 02:21.520
And I got a Polaroid

02:21.608 --> 02:23.542
so I can take a photo diary
of our trip!

02:23.630 --> 02:24.917
Come on,
squeeze together.

02:25.005 --> 02:25.892
I don't want
to be near your dad.

02:25.979 --> 02:27.162
He smells like
coffee and onions.

02:27.249 --> 02:28.551
- Squeeze in.
- You ain't exactly

02:28.639 --> 02:30.198
cinnamon and sugar,
sweetheart.

02:30.286 --> 02:32.199
I don't know where my body
ends and Adam's begins.

02:32.286 --> 02:34.368
This trip is already the worst
thing that's ever happened to me!

02:34.455 --> 02:35.809
Just take
the damn picture!

02:44.007 --> 02:45.739

02:45.826 --> 02:48.596
<i>Of course that meant my dad

02:49.926 --> 02:51.051
Lose the bathrobe.

02:51.138 --> 02:54.855
It's a traditional Jedi cloak
revered the galaxy over.

02:54.942 --> 02:57.354
Well, I'd revere a
tank top if I were you,

02:57.442 --> 02:59.360
because I'm not using
the air conditioning.

02:59.447 --> 03:01.534
You're not cheaping out
on this trip, Murray.

03:01.622 --> 03:02.856
We have
to make it perfect

03:02.944 --> 03:04.492
so that no matter
how old they get

03:04.580 --> 03:06.051
or where
they are in the world,

03:06.139 --> 03:07.958
they'll want to do this
for years to come.

03:08.046 --> 03:09.594
An annual trip?

03:09.690 --> 03:11.238
I was just sitting,
enjoying my cookies.

03:11.325 --> 03:13.140
Now our financial future
is in doubt?

03:13.227 --> 03:14.641
Good news, everyone!

03:14.728 --> 03:16.377
I'm bringing my banjo.

03:16.464 --> 03:17.747
No.
Roger that.

03:17.835 --> 03:20.497
Attention,
uneducated masses!

03:20.634 --> 03:21.731
As you all know,

03:21.819 --> 03:23.616
I'll be attending college
in a week,

03:23.704 --> 03:25.419
so I need to be
in tip-top shape...

03:25.506 --> 03:26.676
Mind and body.

03:26.766 --> 03:28.119
Is that why you're holding

03:28.207 --> 03:30.323
your mom's
titanium leg pretzel?

03:30.411 --> 03:31.992
This thigh-blasting
machine

03:32.079 --> 03:33.606
is my ticket
to physical dominance.

03:33.694 --> 03:35.551
Just do your dumb thing
in the car.

03:35.639 --> 03:37.021
Where's your sister?
We got to get going.

03:37.108 --> 03:38.464
Saying goodbye
to her boyfriend.

03:38.552 --> 03:39.676
You really
don't want to come

03:39.764 --> 03:42.214
and be jammed in a station
wagon with my family for a week?

03:42.302 --> 03:43.598
And I answered
my own question.

03:43.686 --> 03:44.801
Look, I'll be
on the road, too.

03:44.888 --> 03:46.716
The Dead have four more
concerts left this summer.

03:46.803 --> 03:48.684
I'm hoping by the last one,
I finally like them.

03:49.067 --> 03:50.926
Erica! Let's go!

03:51.411 --> 03:52.424
Um...

03:52.512 --> 03:54.551
One more thing,
we need to talk.

03:54.639 --> 03:55.630
Oh? What is it?

03:55.718 --> 03:57.731
Erica!
Gas is burning!

03:57.819 --> 03:58.630
You know what?
It's nothing.

03:58.725 --> 03:59.786
It... It can wait until
after your trip.

03:59.873 --> 04:01.778
I don't want to spoil it.

04:02.543 --> 04:04.825
I better get moving, too.
B-bye!

04:04.997 --> 04:06.223
Erica!

04:06.445 --> 04:07.630
<i>We're doing it!</i>

04:07.718 --> 04:10.002

04:10.090 --> 04:13.692

04:14.776 --> 04:16.935
We couldn't even leave!

04:17.024 --> 04:18.390
But eventually we did.

04:18.478 --> 04:20.873
And once we hit the highway,
it was smooth sailing.

04:20.961 --> 04:23.554
Of course, there were
some bumps inside the car.

04:23.686 --> 04:25.701
Gah! You keep smashing into me!
Stop it!

04:25.789 --> 04:27.480
No can do, Ad-Rock.

04:27.568 --> 04:30.116
And be warned,
as my muscles grow, expand,

04:30.203 --> 04:32.512
and explode outward,
I'll need more space.

04:32.600 --> 04:34.054
Why do I always have
to sit in the middle?

04:34.141 --> 04:35.710
'Cause windows
are for college men,

04:35.798 --> 04:37.079
not high school losers!

04:37.167 --> 04:39.149
Yeah, you keep calling
yourself a college man,

04:39.313 --> 04:41.495
but come next week,
you're in for a rude awakening.

04:41.582 --> 04:42.629
What's that
supposed to mean?

04:42.716 --> 04:44.374
It means you might be
in college,

04:44.462 --> 04:46.270
but you're just gonna be
a lowly freshman,

04:46.358 --> 04:48.168
totally starting
from scratch socially.

04:48.255 --> 04:50.704
Have you not seen the work
I've been doing on my thighs?

04:50.791 --> 04:51.972
College is gonna love me.

04:52.059 --> 04:54.508
Or the safety of the
only world you've known

04:54.595 --> 04:55.576
will have vanished,

04:55.663 --> 04:57.478
and you'll discover
that there's no place

04:57.565 --> 05:00.581
for an emotionally out-of-control
doof with a thigh device.

05:00.668 --> 05:03.184
What? I am not an emotionally
out-of-control doof!

05:03.272 --> 05:03.984
You are!

05:04.071 --> 05:05.677
Adam, quit working
your brother up.

05:05.765 --> 05:06.820
He's gonna
strain his groin.

05:06.907 --> 05:08.889
Erica, switch seats
with me, please.

05:08.976 --> 05:11.725
Hey, if a guy says he needs to
talk, is that bad?

05:11.812 --> 05:13.727
- Ooh.
- Is that a good "ooh"?

05:13.814 --> 05:15.562
- Uh.
- Is that a good "uh"?

05:15.649 --> 05:16.897
You and Geoff
are toast!

05:16.984 --> 05:19.333
And not good toast with tons
of marmalade and butter.

05:19.420 --> 05:21.768
Bad toast that's burnt
and breaking up with you.

05:21.855 --> 05:23.704
He's not
breaking up with me!

05:23.850 --> 05:25.406
He just got real serious,

05:25.493 --> 05:27.387
and then said he didn't
want to ruin my vacation

05:27.475 --> 05:29.186
by telling me something
and sped off and...

05:29.274 --> 05:30.689
Oh, my God, Geoff's
breaking up with me!

05:30.776 --> 05:31.757
You should call him.

05:31.845 --> 05:33.180
How?
He's on the road, too!

05:33.268 --> 05:34.883
I guess you just
won't know for a week.

05:34.971 --> 05:36.686
But hey,
look on the bright side...

05:36.774 --> 05:37.821
Star Wars.

05:37.909 --> 05:38.909
Yeah, that sounds fun

05:39.006 --> 05:41.508
and so much more important
than my relationship!

05:41.654 --> 05:42.834
You know what's fun?

05:42.976 --> 05:44.031
A sing-along!

05:44.119 --> 05:45.547

06:32.860 --> 06:35.075

06:35.162 --> 06:36.309
But when you see it

06:36.396 --> 06:37.836

she's eyeballing me.

06:45.272 --> 06:46.656
Move your melon, Murray,

06:46.744 --> 06:49.022
so I can enchant her
with a coy wink.

06:49.116 --> 06:50.565
This can't be real.

06:51.469 --> 06:53.118
Oh, it's real, all right.

06:53.206 --> 06:55.789
My fruit guy's nephew
was seduced by a road hussy

06:55.916 --> 06:57.431
and he woke up in a bathtub

06:57.549 --> 07:00.333
missing his kidney, spleen,
corneas, and rectum.

07:00.420 --> 07:01.908
There are road hussies?

07:02.122 --> 07:03.437
Geoff's on the road!

07:03.596 --> 07:04.675

07:04.763 --> 07:05.930

it was 1880-something.

07:17.249 --> 07:19.664
Would you look
at this place?

07:19.899 --> 07:22.054
It's like
stepping back in time!

07:22.142 --> 07:24.491
The hotel room prices
are certainly up-to-date.

07:24.630 --> 07:25.859
Howdy, folks.

07:25.946 --> 07:29.463
Welcome to Durango Gulch,
population 237.

07:29.669 --> 07:30.950
Oops.

07:31.151 --> 07:32.895
Looks like 236.

07:33.014 --> 07:34.387
Funny stuff,
Quick Draw McGraw.

07:34.479 --> 07:35.927
But, um,
where's the pay phones?

07:36.060 --> 07:37.808
It's the 19th century,
ma'am.

07:37.896 --> 07:41.173
I don't reckon to know what hifalutin
contraption you're speaking about.

07:41.261 --> 07:43.510
Okay, so you're just gonna
keep doing the thing?

07:43.817 --> 07:45.591
Great.
I'll be in the saloon.

07:46.451 --> 07:48.973
Ooh, looks like we got
a real cowboy here.

07:49.061 --> 07:50.750
You just step off the
trail, pardner?

07:50.838 --> 07:52.819
I'm walking like this
because I blasted my thighs

07:52.906 --> 07:54.921
with unbridled intensity
for 300 miles.

07:55.008 --> 07:56.389
How would
you two little wranglers

07:56.476 --> 07:58.348
like to be my deputies?

07:59.263 --> 08:01.178
"Little wrangler"?

08:01.266 --> 08:04.082
I'm a man who could grow
twice the mustache you have

08:04.207 --> 08:05.956
except then
you'd be humiliated,

08:06.051 --> 08:07.118
and I'd become sheriff,

08:07.206 --> 08:09.075
and I don't want
that responsibility.

08:09.875 --> 08:12.145
Ohh... Ow, ow. Ohh.

08:12.359 --> 08:15.114
Not cool, man!
Not cool!

08:15.434 --> 08:17.983
Yeah, I don't think he totally
gets what this place is.

08:19.362 --> 08:21.299
There's no way
he's breaking up with me.

08:21.391 --> 08:23.507
I mean, look at me.
I'm a catch.

08:23.799 --> 08:25.291
I guess
I am a little bossy,

08:25.379 --> 08:27.276
but what man
doesn't like that?

08:28.866 --> 08:30.747
Damn it!
He's so leaving me!

08:30.948 --> 08:31.925
Love isn't real!

08:32.011 --> 08:33.323
Neither is your ID.

08:33.410 --> 08:34.760
Oh, sure,
you don't have phones,

08:34.847 --> 08:36.525
but you check
my fake driver's license?

08:36.614 --> 08:37.628
Pick a century!

08:41.388 --> 08:43.698
Yo, wanna go ride
a dead-eyed mule in a circle?

08:43.785 --> 08:44.713
It's super sad!

08:44.801 --> 08:46.955
No! I'm not going on
some dumb kid's ride.

08:47.043 --> 08:48.007
Just leave me alone.

08:48.095 --> 08:50.511
Are you really still upset
that I accurately suggested

08:50.598 --> 08:52.679
you're not ready for the next
major step in your life?

08:52.766 --> 08:56.116
Please, your devastating words
had no effect on me.

08:56.297 --> 08:57.732
I know I'm a man!

09:00.320 --> 09:01.476
Oh, no!

09:01.564 --> 09:03.843
Bandits have surrounded
the stagecoach!

09:03.931 --> 09:04.945
And I'm gonna prove it!

09:05.033 --> 09:06.851
Is there
one man brave enough

09:06.939 --> 09:09.721
to stop these banditos
with this here lasso?

09:09.809 --> 09:13.029
I am that one man,
Fake Sheriff.

09:13.117 --> 09:14.735
You know your way
around a rope, son?

09:14.822 --> 09:16.002
Of course I know ropes.

09:16.089 --> 09:18.271
I've played tug-of-war
and the board game Clue...

09:18.358 --> 09:20.765
But we lost that piece,
so we use an old checker.

09:20.873 --> 09:24.310
Now just swing this thing
in a slow circular pattern.

09:25.337 --> 09:26.352
Yah!

09:26.486 --> 09:27.772
Yah!

09:28.010 --> 09:29.024
Yah!

09:29.112 --> 09:31.381
Yah! Yah!

09:33.206 --> 09:35.321
Is that one of those
cheap plate-glass windows

09:35.408 --> 09:36.790
that cowboys are always
crashing through?

09:36.877 --> 09:37.991
It is not.

09:40.091 --> 09:41.160
Morons!

09:41.248 --> 09:44.430
I mean, who gets kicked out
of an imaginary Western town?

09:44.517 --> 09:46.266
Those rooms
were non-refundable!

09:46.353 --> 09:47.459
Well,
this is just perfect.

09:47.547 --> 09:49.403
Where are we supposed
to stay tonight?

09:49.491 --> 09:51.358
Don't you worry
about me.

09:55.700 --> 09:57.781
Hey, Al.
Ready to go?

09:57.899 --> 09:59.334
You know it, sweetie.

10:00.003 --> 10:01.780
I'm gonna miss you guys.

10:01.869 --> 10:03.420
You know,
you're welcome to stay.

10:03.508 --> 10:05.920
I... I'm being polite.
Punch it!

10:07.975 --> 10:09.055
Okay.

10:09.178 --> 10:10.891
We're still together mostly.

10:10.978 --> 10:13.193
Don't worry,
I've already thought of

10:13.280 --> 10:15.028
a cheap, available place
for us to sleep.

10:15.115 --> 10:17.492
<i>That night,
our hotel didn't have four stars.</i>

10:17.594 --> 10:18.674
<i>It had four wheels.</i>

10:18.762 --> 10:20.733
Stop fluffing me,
I'm not a pillow!

10:20.821 --> 10:21.835
Then get softer!

10:21.922 --> 10:23.623
Will you two dopes
shut up?

10:23.908 --> 10:26.467
My God, this trip sucks.

10:26.561 --> 10:28.541
At least it's the last one
we'll ever take together.

10:28.628 --> 10:31.712
Until Mom forces us to do
this all again next year.

10:31.799 --> 10:34.547
Dummy, we're going off
to college.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.983
We're not doing
this again. Ever.

10:37.070 --> 10:39.219
Yeah, we're
not just moving out.

10:39.306 --> 10:41.154
We're moving on
for good.

10:41.241 --> 10:43.223
<i>In that moment,
I realized our family</i>

10:43.310 --> 10:45.225
<i>was truly going
their separate ways.</i>

10:45.312 --> 10:47.527
<i>No more crazy adventures
with my brother or sister.</i>

10:47.614 --> 10:49.114
<i>And no more middle seat.</i>

10:49.202 --> 10:50.273
I'm okay with it.

10:50.361 --> 10:53.218
<i>But there was one person who
would never be okay with it.</i>

10:55.482 --> 10:58.037
<i>Our family vacation
was still on track for Disneyland,</i>

10:58.125 --> 11:00.547
<i>but my mom's mind
was on a different path.</i>

11:00.635 --> 11:02.470
Murray, the kids aren't
gonna go away to college

11:02.557 --> 11:04.277
- and never come back, right?
- I dunno.

11:04.364 --> 11:06.218
Sure they're growing up,
but they love us

11:06.306 --> 11:08.682
- and want to stay in our lives forever!
- I dunno.

11:08.769 --> 11:10.951
My children will spend
every summer with me

11:11.038 --> 11:12.431
until the day I die!

11:12.519 --> 11:14.249
And even then,
they're gonna carry my urn

11:14.337 --> 11:15.856
on every vacation
they ever take.

11:15.943 --> 11:17.978
Of course! Well,
you're finally agreeing with me?

11:18.066 --> 11:19.981
Of course they're
screwing me at the pump!

11:20.138 --> 11:22.086
$9 to fill up a tank?

11:22.182 --> 11:25.538
Our babies are choosing to
de-latch from our collective bosom

11:25.626 --> 11:28.001
and all you care about
is gas mileage!

11:28.089 --> 11:29.270
What do you want from me?

11:29.358 --> 11:30.974
I don't know what those
morons are gonna do.

11:31.061 --> 11:32.375
But I do know
they're here now,

11:32.463 --> 11:35.306
so let's, uh, drive around
or, uh, whatever.

11:35.394 --> 11:36.441
That's right!

11:36.529 --> 11:37.911
They're with us now!

11:37.998 --> 11:40.046
So if we make this trip
extra special,

11:40.133 --> 11:41.858
they're gonna want
to come back for more!

11:41.946 --> 11:43.516
Yeah, I dunno.

11:43.603 --> 11:45.767
As my mom was trying
to keep her family together,

11:45.884 --> 11:49.155
my sister was trying to keep her
relationship from falling apart.

11:49.242 --> 11:50.814
Hey, Geoff, it's Erica.

11:50.986 --> 11:52.376
Just checking in to
see

11:52.464 --> 11:54.040
what you meant by,
"We need to talk."

11:54.158 --> 11:56.931
Probably just wanted to say
how we have no problems

11:57.019 --> 11:58.700
and we're a perfect couple.

11:59.027 --> 12:01.228
Okay, well, have fun
on the road, bye!

12:01.592 --> 12:04.525
Unfortunately, she couldn't
leave just one message.

12:04.613 --> 12:06.806
Here's what "We need
to talk" means to me.

12:07.094 --> 12:08.508
It means
we have a problem.

12:08.595 --> 12:09.810
So is... Is it me?

12:09.897 --> 12:11.150
You're the problem, Geoff!

12:11.264 --> 12:12.779
Maybe I don't want you!

12:12.866 --> 12:14.299
Come back to me,
my widdle Geoffy-weffy.

12:14.386 --> 12:15.423
You're a butt!

12:15.511 --> 12:17.226
And not just
the tiny part of the butt,

12:17.504 --> 12:18.530
but the whole mound.

12:18.618 --> 12:21.486
The cheeks, the smelly
region, all of it.

12:22.215 --> 12:24.030
Okey-doke.
I think I got it.

12:24.226 --> 12:25.207
Thanks, Dr. Schwartz.

12:25.295 --> 12:26.375
Oh, I almost forgot.

12:26.463 --> 12:28.491
Geoffrey called and passed on
a message of his own.

12:28.579 --> 12:29.495
What did he say?

12:29.582 --> 12:31.814
He said he needs to
tell you in person,

12:31.933 --> 12:34.181
but it's big
and possibly upsetting.

12:34.269 --> 12:36.369
That doesn't help at all.
It just makes everything worse!

12:36.456 --> 12:37.876
Sure thing, honey.
Bye now.

12:40.009 --> 12:41.141
Why didn't you
get a slushie?

12:41.228 --> 12:42.675
They had your favorite...
Blue.

12:42.762 --> 12:45.311
Real men don't drink
that delicious crap.

12:45.398 --> 12:46.780
They drink
boiling-hot coffee.

12:46.867 --> 12:48.087
But you hate coffee.

12:48.175 --> 12:49.939
That was Yesterday Barry.

12:50.027 --> 12:53.181
But now my taste buds and
skittish tummy have matured.

12:54.943 --> 12:56.792
How could you put this
in your body?

12:56.892 --> 12:57.993
Ugh!

12:59.046 --> 13:00.134
I love it.

13:00.222 --> 13:03.368
Okay, Bar, clearly I freaked you
out about starting college...

13:03.456 --> 13:04.603
I'm not freaked out!

13:04.691 --> 13:05.986
If anything,
I'm freaked in!

13:06.074 --> 13:08.323
- That doesn't mean anything.
- You don't mean anything!

13:08.411 --> 13:10.469
You're a tiny boy who
doesn't know the struggles

13:10.557 --> 13:13.212
of a fully grown
college gentleman!

13:14.928 --> 13:16.423
Hot! Hot!

13:18.655 --> 13:20.236
This is hard to watch.

13:20.362 --> 13:22.509
But the good news is we'll
be in Anaheim in two days.

13:22.619 --> 13:23.933
Change of plans!

13:24.021 --> 13:27.103
I've got a surefire way to make sure
everybody loves this vacation...

13:27.323 --> 13:29.321
Make it way longer!

13:29.409 --> 13:30.454
Oh, balls.

13:30.542 --> 13:33.692
We are gonna hit every major
attraction from here to California.

13:33.874 --> 13:34.821
But that'll
take forever.

13:34.909 --> 13:36.428
What about
my "Star Tours" ride?

13:36.516 --> 13:39.618
Schmoopie, it's about the
journey, not the destination.

13:39.752 --> 13:42.068
Ha! You have to
appreciate the journey!

13:42.155 --> 13:44.838
Ah, see? Barry's excited!
Who else?

13:44.925 --> 13:47.240
Might as well,
my relationship is probably over.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.585
See? Another one of my
babies didn't say no!

13:49.673 --> 13:50.310
Murray?

13:50.397 --> 13:51.845
I don't care what we do,
as long as it's free.

13:51.932 --> 13:52.806
Ah! See?

13:52.894 --> 13:55.877
Everyone's in and happy
and we're making memories,

13:55.965 --> 13:59.204
and this is gonna be the best
Goldbergs vacation ever!

14:00.040 --> 14:01.759
Say, "Cheese"!

14:01.847 --> 14:04.295
<i>And so we saw America.</i>

14:04.544 --> 14:06.875
<i>In all its weird
and magnificent glory.</i>

14:06.963 --> 14:08.754
<i>There were sculptures
made of cars,</i>

14:08.999 --> 14:10.814
<i>mountains made of faces,</i>

14:11.026 --> 14:12.969
<i>one big hole.</i>

14:13.165 --> 14:14.880
<i>But what took
our breath away the most</i>

14:15.155 --> 14:17.914
<i>was the crappy motel our dad
insisted staying at.</i>

14:18.125 --> 14:20.540
This is the kind of motel
where people live full-time.

14:20.627 --> 14:21.774
Uh, it's gross.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.000
It's cozy.

14:23.088 --> 14:24.669
There's police tape
around the pool.

14:24.831 --> 14:28.188
That shows the police have
already been here. So it's safe.

14:28.276 --> 14:30.928
Look! They got one of those
Magic Fingers bed massagers.

14:31.016 --> 14:31.873
No!

14:31.961 --> 14:33.094
Nobody touch anything

14:33.182 --> 14:35.097
until I hit it with
some Lysol Pine action.

14:35.185 --> 14:36.432
I'm turning it on!

14:36.535 --> 14:39.024
My thighs and tummy muscles
are still sore!

14:40.254 --> 14:43.090
Let's soothe
my aching bones!

14:44.517 --> 14:46.987
Lemme turn it down.

14:48.509 --> 14:49.891
Damn it, moron!

14:49.979 --> 14:51.774
They don't have
any more rooms!

14:51.883 --> 14:53.516
What do you do
with these things?

14:53.604 --> 14:56.516
I've got a super fun idea
that solves everything!

14:57.660 --> 14:59.341
Who can sleep like this?

14:59.616 --> 15:02.166
<i>Yeah,
we barely slept a wink that night.</i>

15:02.237 --> 15:03.850
<i>And we were so exhausted
the next morning,</i>

15:03.937 --> 15:05.586
<i>everyone passed out
in the car.</i>

15:05.674 --> 15:07.055
<i>And I mean everyone.</i>

15:26.945 --> 15:29.640
Do you think this will
affect our time at Disneyland?

15:31.482 --> 15:33.731
Barry,
this is all your fault!

15:33.967 --> 15:35.648
You and your stupid
bed massager.

15:35.735 --> 15:37.836
I know! I'm not a man!

15:38.057 --> 15:41.173
I'm starting college,
but the truth is I still feel like a boy.

15:41.308 --> 15:42.708
Like sad, pathetic
little Adam here.

15:42.797 --> 15:43.797
Hey!

15:43.922 --> 15:44.974
Will you shut up?

15:45.062 --> 15:46.226
I mean, look at this!

15:46.313 --> 15:48.328
Now I'll never get to a
phone and learn the truth

15:48.415 --> 15:49.762
that I definitely
don't wanna know!

15:49.849 --> 15:50.897
My God!

15:50.984 --> 15:52.999
You're both
just selfish jerks!

15:53.086 --> 15:54.167
You know,
I actually thought

15:54.254 --> 15:56.536
I was gonna miss you next
year, but good riddance!

15:56.623 --> 15:57.703
Stop!

15:57.790 --> 15:59.039
Tell me the truth...

15:59.126 --> 16:02.414
Are you all gonna head out the door
for college and never look back?

16:04.133 --> 16:05.768
I see.

16:06.800 --> 16:09.582
Every one of these pictures
breaks my heart.

16:09.936 --> 16:12.052
You all look sad or angry
or miserable.

16:12.139 --> 16:13.859
And that is not
what I wanted.

16:14.141 --> 16:16.056
- Bevy...
- No!

16:16.143 --> 16:18.594
Let's just go home
and be done with it.

16:19.312 --> 16:21.327
I can't take another day
of family vacation

16:21.414 --> 16:23.429
if this is the last one
I'm ever gonna have.

16:27.082 --> 16:30.002
<i>Our car and
our mom were broken,</i>

16:30.090 --> 16:31.938
<i>and all we wanted
was to go home.</i>

16:32.025 --> 16:33.706
I thought we had more
suitcases than this.

16:33.793 --> 16:34.774
We did.

16:34.861 --> 16:36.392
At least this
horrible trip is over.

16:36.480 --> 16:38.744
<i>But it wasn't.
Not for my dad.</i>

16:38.831 --> 16:41.847
<i>He was about to head down
a road we never expected.</i>

16:41.934 --> 16:43.449
You know what I think?

16:43.536 --> 16:45.085
I think you're all ****
in the head.

16:45.172 --> 16:46.786
- Whoa!
- Motel language!

16:46.873 --> 16:47.887
You're just
gonna give up?

16:47.974 --> 16:48.955
- Yeah.
- Kinda.

16:49.042 --> 16:49.793
Do we have a choice?

16:49.881 --> 16:53.058
Your mom worked her ass off
to plan you a great vacation,

16:53.180 --> 16:54.699
and I didn't know why.

16:54.881 --> 16:56.996
But, damn it, I do now.

16:57.517 --> 16:58.764
Murray,
what are you saying?

16:58.851 --> 17:00.566
I'm not sure
about the future,

17:00.769 --> 17:02.802
but right here, right now,

17:02.889 --> 17:05.605
there's no amount of money
I wouldn't spend

17:05.692 --> 17:07.640
for my family
to have a great vacation.

17:07.727 --> 17:08.808
Dad's suddenly
thoughtful!

17:08.895 --> 17:10.310
He must've banged his head
in the accident!

17:10.396 --> 17:11.411
Are you serious?

17:11.498 --> 17:13.519
To keep
this family together,

17:13.863 --> 17:15.801
I would spend
every last penny.

17:17.671 --> 17:19.019
Hey, Goldbergs,
need a lift?

17:19.107 --> 17:21.150
Thank God! Everybody get in!
Come on!

17:21.238 --> 17:22.746
Geoff!
How did you find us?

17:22.834 --> 17:25.392
Well, you left my dad a lot
of very upsetting messages,

17:25.480 --> 17:26.959
so I drove here
as fast as I could.

17:27.046 --> 17:28.928
I followed your suitcases
like bread crumbs!

17:29.015 --> 17:31.027
So, what did you want
to talk to me about?

17:32.997 --> 17:34.179
Well...

17:34.321 --> 17:37.770
I had such an amazing time
doing nothing this summer,

17:37.857 --> 17:40.058
that I want it
to continue.

17:40.237 --> 17:41.637
I'm not going to school
in the fall.

17:42.380 --> 17:43.861
Oh, my God!
That's it?

17:43.949 --> 17:46.346
Well, yeah. I mean,
it's a pretty big deal.

17:46.433 --> 17:47.680
My dad's not thrilled.

17:47.767 --> 17:48.981
And your messages
didn't exactly

17:49.068 --> 17:50.650
fill him with hope
for my future.

17:50.785 --> 17:52.785
You jerk! I thought you
were breaking up with me!

17:52.910 --> 17:54.187
What? Never.

17:54.274 --> 17:56.274
You're the greatest thing
that ever happened to me.

17:56.490 --> 17:57.771
I never doubted it.

17:57.881 --> 18:00.463
<i>Turns out some trips
are about finding your way,</i>

18:00.613 --> 18:02.613
<i>and not losing track
of where you're headed.</i>

18:02.749 --> 18:04.797
Hey, Bar.
About what I said.

18:04.884 --> 18:06.466
No, you were right.

18:06.553 --> 18:07.832
I'm not ready for college.

18:07.920 --> 18:08.967
Of course you are.

18:09.058 --> 18:10.536
You're Big Tasty.

18:10.623 --> 18:13.706
You attack everything you do with
the full force of your being.

18:13.793 --> 18:16.486
Trust me, college is gonna be
a piece of cake for you.

18:16.574 --> 18:17.710
You really think so?

18:17.797 --> 18:18.931
I know so.

18:19.622 --> 18:21.113
Thanks, Ad-Rock.

18:21.535 --> 18:23.089
<i>Venturing out
can be scary,</i>

18:23.187 --> 18:24.683
<i>but it's easier
to take that trek</i>

18:24.771 --> 18:26.863
<i>when you're riding
with the people you love.</i>

18:27.035 --> 18:28.855
<i>Family vacations are hard.</i>

18:28.943 --> 18:31.793
<i>They're stressful
and expensive,</i>

18:32.074 --> 18:33.566
<i>and uncomfortable.</i>

18:33.654 --> 18:35.069
<i>But the thing
that makes them great</i>

18:35.157 --> 18:37.582
<i>are the memories
of doing it all together.</i>

18:38.011 --> 18:39.730
We're really here.

18:40.253 --> 18:41.597
Thank you, Mama.

18:42.088 --> 18:43.569
Anything for you, schmoo.

18:43.656 --> 18:45.838
Maybe next year we can go
to Walt Disney World.

18:45.925 --> 18:46.906
That sounds pretty cool.

18:46.993 --> 18:48.074
Yeah, I guess I'd try it.

18:48.161 --> 18:50.310
Wait... You guys
would wanna do this again?

18:50.397 --> 18:51.877
I'm open to it.

18:51.964 --> 18:54.605
Ah! My schmoopies
will be with me forever!

18:56.769 --> 18:58.457
Are we too late?

18:58.599 --> 19:01.144
- We got lost.
- Intentionally.

19:01.232 --> 19:03.277
Just in time, Pops!
We're running for it!

19:22.161 --> 19:24.371
Oh, sorry,
park's closed.

19:24.531 --> 19:26.779
What? Oh, no!
S-someone do something!

19:26.866 --> 19:28.364
I'm here!

19:28.535 --> 19:30.590
Don't worry, schmoo.
Mama's got this.

19:30.798 --> 19:31.779
In that moment,

19:31.867 --> 19:33.908
<i>Beverly Goldberg
did what she did best...</i>

19:33.996 --> 19:35.973
<i>She lied her ass off.</i>

19:36.061 --> 19:38.776
<i>She told elaborate,
far-fetched tales of our journey.</i>

19:38.987 --> 19:41.270
<i>Apparently,
we were attacked by bald eagles</i>

19:41.381 --> 19:43.196
<i>and a motorcycle gang?</i>

19:43.283 --> 19:46.369
<i>There was a tornado,
and then a tsunami.</i>

19:46.457 --> 19:48.278
<i>And then another tornado.</i>

19:48.366 --> 19:52.168
<i>She wove a tapestry of lies
so intricate, so beautiful,</i>

19:52.359 --> 19:54.407
<i>by the end, none of us knew
what was real.</i>

19:54.494 --> 19:55.975
..and that is when
little Adam

19:56.062 --> 19:59.044
had to help his grandpa
by sucking out the venom.

19:59.131 --> 20:02.145
Wow, you guys have been through
a whole lot as a family.

20:02.233 --> 20:04.315
And you know what? I had no idea
there were zebras in Arizona.

20:04.402 --> 20:06.184
Zebras are the piranhas
of the sand.

20:06.272 --> 20:08.853
Well, you know what?
All I meant was the park is closed now.

20:08.947 --> 20:10.645
But it opens
in 15 minutes.

20:11.648 --> 20:13.309
Why didn't you
say something?

20:13.397 --> 20:15.489
Well, I tried, but you were
going on and on and on.

20:15.582 --> 20:17.330
But go on in!
Come on, the park's all yours!

20:17.417 --> 20:18.942
Rusty, you're the best!

20:19.052 --> 20:21.291
Let's do it, Adam!
Let's go ride "Star Tours"!

20:21.379 --> 20:22.302
No, no!

20:22.389 --> 20:25.171
I think I know something that would
be more fun for the whole family.

20:25.258 --> 20:26.639
<i>♪ Holiday road</i>

20:26.825 --> 20:29.434
<i>We finally made it
to the happiest place on Earth.</i>

20:29.522 --> 20:32.076
<i>And as magical as it was,
thanks to my mom,</i>

20:32.164 --> 20:35.121
<i>I realized the best part
of the Goldberg vacation</i>

20:35.209 --> 20:36.490
<i>was the journey.</i>

20:36.689 --> 20:39.405
<i>To this day,
we still travel as a family.</i>

20:39.539 --> 20:41.204
<i>Of course,
it never gets easier,</i>

20:41.292 --> 20:43.720
<i>but I wouldn't trade it
for the world.</i>

20:45.540 --> 20:50.204
<i>- ♪ Holiday ro-o-o-o-o-o-ad ♪

20:50.384 --> 20:55.336

- ♪ Oh whoa whoa, Oh whoa whoa! ♪</i>

21:05.147 --> 21:08.552
Wakey-wakey! Get out!
I was just dreaming about

21:08.640 --> 21:10.182
scoring a touchdown
for the Eagles!

21:10.269 --> 21:11.484
But I brought you
breakfast.

21:11.571 --> 21:12.585
Well, finally!

21:12.673 --> 21:15.029
I've been trying to take my
meals in my room for years.

21:15.117 --> 21:16.155
Gimme!

21:16.242 --> 21:17.623
This is
a whole lotta liquids.

21:17.710 --> 21:19.687
All part of
a balanced breakfast.

21:20.549 --> 21:21.863
No! My juices!

21:21.981 --> 21:23.863
Oh, no! My hot coffee!

21:23.950 --> 21:26.165
Oh, no! Adam! Hit stop!

21:26.252 --> 21:28.133
I should have never
stolen this from the motel!

21:28.220 --> 21:29.695
Yeah,
I'm gonna miss you.
