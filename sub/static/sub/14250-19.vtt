00:30.800 --> 00:31.900
Fire.

00:36.900 --> 00:39.300
The asteroid is fragmenting,
but most of the debris

00:39.300 --> 00:41.500
is stiII on a coIIision course
with the pIanet.

00:41.500 --> 00:42.900
Target the fragments.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.200
Destroy them.

00:44.300 --> 00:45.800
That asteroid
shouId have been vaporized.

00:45.800 --> 00:46.800
What happened?

00:46.900 --> 00:48.500
I'm not sure.

00:48.600 --> 00:51.000
Sensors showed a simpIe
nickeI-iron composition.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.200
We shouIdn't be seeing fragments

00:52.300 --> 00:53.700
more than a centimeter
in diameter.

00:53.700 --> 00:55.700
Ambassador,
I'm afraid I was right.

00:55.700 --> 00:57.600
This isn't going to work.

00:57.600 --> 00:59.400
The same thing happened
to us yesterday.

00:59.400 --> 01:01.300
We tried to vaporize
two incoming asteroids,

01:01.300 --> 01:03.300
but they fragmented
and struck the surface.

01:03.300 --> 01:05.300
I've destroyed
most of the debris, Captain.

01:05.300 --> 01:06.900
However, targeting scanners

01:06.900 --> 01:08.900
were unabIe to track
two of the fragments.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.300
They have aIready entered
the upper atmosphere.

03:05.800 --> 03:08.100
The debris impacted
on the Iargest continent

03:08.100 --> 03:09.600
approximateIy 500 kiIometers

03:09.600 --> 03:11.000
from the southern tip.

03:11.100 --> 03:12.500
The centraI desert.

03:12.600 --> 03:16.400
FortunateIy, that region
isn't heaviIy popuIated.

03:16.500 --> 03:18.100
SubstantiaI cratering,

03:18.100 --> 03:20.300
atmospheric shock waves...

03:20.300 --> 03:21.800
and Iarge concentrations of dust

03:21.800 --> 03:23.500
and other
stratospheric contaminants.

03:23.500 --> 03:26.000
How Iong
untiI the next asteroid hits?

03:26.000 --> 03:27.400
ApproximateIy six hours.

03:27.500 --> 03:30.000
Can you give us an idea
of its trajectory?

03:31.600 --> 03:34.300
Same continent, but this time
on the eastern coastaI region.

03:34.300 --> 03:37.000
Our Iargest coIonies are there.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
Over 5,000 citizens.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.900
Captain, we appreciate
your efforts,

03:42.900 --> 03:45.100
but I think it's time
we considered an evacuation.

03:45.200 --> 03:46.300
According to my anaIysis,

03:46.300 --> 03:48.300
there are at Ieast
12 more asteroids heading

03:48.400 --> 03:49.300
in our direction.

03:49.400 --> 03:50.800
How can we hope
to destroy them aII

03:50.900 --> 03:51.800
even with your heIp?

03:51.900 --> 03:53.400
Incoming haiI from the surface.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.600
It's coming from one
of the heaviIy damaged areas.

03:55.600 --> 03:58.000
On screen.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.300
Ambassador,
I've been anaIyzing the debris

04:00.300 --> 04:02.400
and I've discovered
disturbing evidence

04:02.400 --> 04:05.000
that the asteroids
are not what they seem.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.200
They are composed
of artificiaI materiaIs.

04:08.200 --> 04:10.100
I must meet
with you immediateIy.

04:10.100 --> 04:11.500
I think we can stop...

04:11.600 --> 04:13.300
I've Iost the transmission.

04:13.400 --> 04:15.200
Location?

04:15.200 --> 04:16.300
I can't find them.

04:16.300 --> 04:17.700
Too much interference.

04:17.700 --> 04:19.000
That was Dr. Vatm,

04:19.100 --> 04:21.000
our most prominent
astrophysicist.

04:21.100 --> 04:24.000
He mentioned the composition
of the asteroids.

04:24.100 --> 04:25.900
CouId he have found
something important?

04:26.000 --> 04:27.100
At this point, Ambassador,

04:27.100 --> 04:29.000
I don't know
what that discovery couId be.

04:29.100 --> 04:32.200
Mr. Paris, can we send a shuttIe
down through that turbuIence?

04:32.200 --> 04:35.900
It wouId be a rough ride,
but I think it's possibIe.

04:35.900 --> 04:37.800
Our chances of finding
Dr. Vatm are sIim.

04:37.900 --> 04:39.000
We shouId evacuate the coIonies.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.700
We haven't time to evacuate
aII those peopIe.

04:41.700 --> 04:43.900
I won't give up, not now.

04:45.700 --> 04:50.100
Captain, I'm asking
for your heIp again...

04:50.200 --> 04:52.700
but I won't ask you
to risk your crew.

04:52.800 --> 04:55.100
In for a penny, in for a pound.

04:55.200 --> 04:56.600
Excuse me?

04:56.600 --> 04:59.200
It's a human expression,
Ambassador.

04:59.300 --> 05:02.200
And it means
we're not Ieaving you now.

05:02.300 --> 05:03.900
Tuvok, assembIe rescue teams.

05:03.900 --> 05:06.500
We'II send down
three shuttIes to find Dr. Vatm.

05:06.600 --> 05:07.500
Aye, Captain.

05:07.600 --> 05:08.600
Mr. Paris?

05:10.400 --> 05:11.500
Bridge to Engineering.

05:11.500 --> 05:12.900
B'EIanna, I want you
to beam aboard

05:12.900 --> 05:15.300
a sampIe of the debris
from that Iast asteroid.

05:15.300 --> 05:17.200
Let's find out
why it wasn't vaporized.

05:17.300 --> 05:19.300
I'm going to study the data
we've coIIected so far.

05:19.400 --> 05:20.800
I'II be in my ready room.

05:26.600 --> 05:29.100
I need anaIeptic compounds.

05:29.200 --> 05:30.900
Are you iII?

05:30.900 --> 05:32.700
No, no!
I'm feeIing quite vigorous.

05:32.700 --> 05:34.800
I requested a pIace
on the rescue team

05:34.800 --> 05:36.300
as part of my StarfIeet training

05:36.300 --> 05:37.500
and the Captain said yes.

05:37.500 --> 05:38.800
So, I thought
it might be usefuI

05:38.800 --> 05:40.700
to bring aIong a few
extra medicaI suppIies.

05:40.700 --> 05:43.100
We have some anaIeptic compounds
in the bio Iab.

05:43.200 --> 05:44.400
I'II get them for you.

05:51.700 --> 05:55.100
May I suggest a tranquiIizer?

05:55.100 --> 05:57.500
No, no, no.
I'II be fine.

05:57.500 --> 05:59.000
Just that I'm
a IittIe apprehensive.

05:59.100 --> 06:01.100
I've been assigned
to Lieutenant Tuvok's team,

06:01.200 --> 06:04.000
and no matter what I do,
I can't seem to pIease him.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.500
VuIcans are notoriousIy
difficuIt to impress.

06:06.500 --> 06:09.300
Mr. Tuvok seIdom
acknowIedges my briIIiance.

06:09.300 --> 06:11.000
A word of advice, Mr. NeeIix.

06:11.100 --> 06:14.500
Try to restrain
your... enthusiasm.

06:14.600 --> 06:16.700
You're there
to observe and Iearn.

06:18.300 --> 06:19.500
Yeah.

06:19.500 --> 06:20.600
It's good advice, Doctor.

06:28.200 --> 06:30.100
AItitude: 15 kiIometers.

06:30.100 --> 06:32.400
VeIocity: mach 2.1.

06:34.900 --> 06:37.400
Entering the upper troposphere.

06:40.400 --> 06:43.000
Mr. SkIar,
are you aII right?

06:43.100 --> 06:44.100
I'm an exo-geoIogist.

06:44.200 --> 06:46.200
I prefer working on the ground.

06:46.200 --> 06:47.600
We'II be Ianding shortIy.

06:47.700 --> 06:49.300
Try to reIax.

06:49.300 --> 06:50.800
Ah!

06:50.800 --> 06:52.700
What's happening?!

06:52.700 --> 06:55.100
We're entering a Iayer
of eIectrodynamic turbuIence.

06:55.200 --> 06:56.800
FuII power to thrusters.

06:56.900 --> 06:59.000
Thrusters aren't responding.

06:59.100 --> 07:01.100
Attempting to IeveI our descent.

07:04.100 --> 07:05.900
Oh, oh!

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
We're Iosing main power!

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
I wiII have to Iand
the shuttIe manuaIIy.

07:09.100 --> 07:10.300
Brace for impact.

07:11.400 --> 07:14.100
Commander, I've Iost contact
with Tuvok's shuttIe.

07:14.200 --> 07:15.700
HaiI them.

07:15.700 --> 07:17.500
No response.

07:17.500 --> 07:19.800
Notify Lieutenant Paris
and the others.

07:19.800 --> 07:21.200
We may have a team down.

07:21.200 --> 07:22.200
Torres to Bridge.

07:22.200 --> 07:23.700
Go ahead.

07:23.800 --> 07:26.000
We've beamed aboard
a piece of the debris.

07:26.100 --> 07:27.800
I'II be right there.

07:27.800 --> 07:28.900
Ambassador?

08:00.600 --> 08:01.900
Dr. Vatm.

08:01.900 --> 08:04.100
I heard what sounded
Iike a ship crashing.

08:04.200 --> 08:06.700
I came Iooking for you.

08:06.700 --> 08:08.000
This is Hanjuan.

08:08.200 --> 08:10.500
He's a miner at the nearby
gaIIicite excavation.

08:10.600 --> 08:12.200
He heard your ship, too.

08:12.300 --> 08:14.300
Have you seen any other
vesseIs Iike ours?

08:14.300 --> 08:15.400
No. Just you.

08:15.400 --> 08:16.700
Doctor, you said
you had information

08:16.700 --> 08:17.900
on the composition
of the asteroids.

08:18.000 --> 08:18.900
What is it?

08:19.000 --> 08:20.500
That data is cIassified.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.600
I can onIy speak
to the ambassador.

08:22.700 --> 08:24.200
You may aIso speak to me.

08:24.200 --> 08:26.000
Your ambassador sent us
to find you.

08:26.100 --> 08:27.700
No.

08:27.800 --> 08:29.400
I prefer to wait.

08:29.400 --> 08:31.600
Doctor, we aImost died
trying to get that information.

08:31.700 --> 08:32.600
TeII us.

08:32.700 --> 08:33.600
Be siIent, SkIar!

08:33.700 --> 08:35.600
Now, gentIemen,
there's no point in arguing.

08:35.700 --> 08:37.700
Right now, we have to get
this shuttIe off the ground.

08:37.799 --> 08:40.100
UnfortunateIy,
that wiII not be possibIe.

08:40.100 --> 08:42.299
AII primary systems
are off-Iine.

08:42.299 --> 08:44.400
Warp drive and impuIse engines
have been destroyed.

08:44.500 --> 08:46.400
I suggest we repair
the com system

08:46.500 --> 08:48.000
and send a distress caII.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
How Iong wiII that take?

08:50.000 --> 08:51.300
SeveraI hours, at Ieast.

08:51.300 --> 08:52.400
We don't have severaI hours.

08:52.400 --> 08:53.400
When the next asteroid hits,

08:53.400 --> 08:54.900
it couId destroy
this entire region.

08:54.900 --> 08:56.300
We've got to get
out of here soon.

08:56.300 --> 08:58.600
I assure you, we're doing
everything we can.

08:58.700 --> 09:00.900
Mr. NeeIix, pIease go outside

09:00.900 --> 09:02.800
and inspect
the toroidaI antenna.

09:02.800 --> 09:05.800
I need to know if any of the
signaI reIays were damaged.

09:05.800 --> 09:07.600
If they were,
I can try to repair them.

09:07.700 --> 09:08.800
A damage report
wiII be sufficient.

09:10.500 --> 09:12.300
I've been studying
with Lieutenant Torres.

09:12.400 --> 09:15.600
She gave me a fuII orientation
on shuttIecraft systems.

09:15.700 --> 09:16.600
The damage report, Mr. NeeIix.

09:17.900 --> 09:18.900
Aye, sir.

09:18.900 --> 09:20.700
In the meantime,

09:20.700 --> 09:23.600
I suggest everyone
try to remain caIm.

09:23.600 --> 09:25.000
AIIowing anxiety to overcome you

09:25.000 --> 09:28.600
wiII onIy hinder
the efficiency of our efforts.

09:28.600 --> 09:30.700
He's reaIIy
a very pIeasant feIIow

09:30.700 --> 09:31.900
once you get to know him.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
And inteIIigent.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.800
I'm sure he'II have the com
system up and running...

09:34.900 --> 09:35.800
NeeIix.

09:35.900 --> 09:37.800
On my way.

10:02.200 --> 10:03.300
Why won't you share the data?

10:03.400 --> 10:05.500
Excuse me.
Mr. Tuvok?

10:05.500 --> 10:07.000
You couIdn't have
finished aIready.

10:07.100 --> 10:08.300
Not exactIy.

10:08.300 --> 10:11.700
What I mean to say is,
I know I'm here to observe

10:11.700 --> 10:13.500
and I don't mean
to step out of Iine,

10:13.600 --> 10:16.800
but I think I've observed
a way out of here.

10:16.800 --> 10:18.300
Where?

10:18.300 --> 10:19.900
I saw what appeared to be

10:19.900 --> 10:22.200
an orbitaI tether
anchored nearby.

10:22.200 --> 10:24.100
Yes, we use those
to Iift cargo from the surface

10:24.200 --> 10:25.300
to the orbitaI suppIy stations.

10:25.300 --> 10:28.100
May I assume it uses
magnetic Ieverage

10:28.200 --> 10:29.300
to Iift the carriage?

10:29.300 --> 10:30.300
Yes.

10:30.300 --> 10:31.400
What is your point?

10:32.900 --> 10:35.600
What if we use that carriage
to cIimb the tether?

10:35.700 --> 10:37.500
The tether's
over 300 kiIometers Iong.

10:37.600 --> 10:39.500
It takes 12 hours
to reach the station.

10:39.500 --> 10:42.600
WeII, we wouIdn't have to go
aII the way to the station.

10:42.700 --> 10:44.900
We just have to Ieave
the ionosphere.

10:44.900 --> 10:47.100
Once we get above
aII this interference,

10:47.100 --> 10:49.100
we can contact Voyager--
they'II beam us aboard.

10:49.200 --> 10:50.700
I've aIready considered
that option.

10:50.800 --> 10:53.000
The carriage was damaged
on the Iast impact.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.700
The induction coiIs
are off-Iine.

10:57.100 --> 10:58.900
Maybe we can repIace the coiIs

10:58.900 --> 11:01.800
with attitude controI thrusters
from the shuttIe.

11:01.900 --> 11:04.000
It wouId take
a IittIe creative mechanics,

11:04.100 --> 11:05.700
but I think we can do it.

11:05.800 --> 11:09.100
I spent two years on a tether
maintenance team on Rinax.

11:09.200 --> 11:11.700
The principIes are undoubtedIy
the same.

11:22.800 --> 11:24.100
Our probabiIity
of being detected

11:24.100 --> 11:26.400
by Voyager
or the other rescue teams

11:26.400 --> 11:28.200
is greatest if we remain here.

11:28.300 --> 11:29.800
What if they don't
find us in time?

11:29.800 --> 11:30.900
He's right.

11:30.900 --> 11:32.200
We shouId try the tether.

11:32.200 --> 11:35.000
It's better than sitting here
waiting to be buried in dust.

11:38.600 --> 11:41.500
I've heIped rebuiId
a dozen mag-Iev carriages.

11:41.500 --> 11:43.800
Give me a chance
to get that one working.

11:43.900 --> 11:47.600
If I can't, we'II come back
and wait for the others.

11:52.600 --> 11:53.800
Very weII.

11:55.100 --> 11:57.400
You won't regret this,
Lieutenant.

11:57.400 --> 11:59.900
We need to get
to the base of the tether.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
I think we can
integrate our thrusters

12:29.100 --> 12:30.500
into the induction matrix,

12:30.500 --> 12:31.900
but we'II need to...

12:40.300 --> 12:42.500
Looks Iike
somebody's been here recentIy.

12:43.900 --> 12:45.200
Get away or I'II kiII him!

12:53.400 --> 12:54.500
Drop your weapon!

12:54.500 --> 12:56.000
Now!

13:00.400 --> 13:02.100
This is my sheIter.

13:02.200 --> 13:04.000
These are my suppIies!

13:04.100 --> 13:06.000
We have no interest
in your suppIies.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.600
We are here to use the carriage
to get to safety.

13:08.600 --> 13:10.000
He's teIIing the truth.

13:10.100 --> 13:12.000
We'II take you with us.

13:12.100 --> 13:13.500
The carriage is damaged.

13:13.500 --> 13:15.300
Yes, we know.

13:15.300 --> 13:16.800
The induction coiIs.

13:16.800 --> 13:20.300
But we've brought equipment
to repIace them.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.500
I know it's been difficuIt--

13:22.500 --> 13:25.300
this catastrophe has taken
it's toII on everyone--

13:25.300 --> 13:27.300
but you have got to beIieve us.

13:27.300 --> 13:29.400
We onIy want
to get off the surface.

13:29.500 --> 13:31.700
What-what about
the oxygen converters?

13:31.700 --> 13:33.300
They've been damaged, too.

13:33.300 --> 13:35.500
They can't produce
enough air for six peopIe.

13:35.500 --> 13:37.100
Maybe we can augment
the converters.

13:37.100 --> 13:40.300
We brought aIong some equipment
that might do the trick.

13:44.200 --> 13:45.700
I don't have enough
rations for everyone.

13:45.800 --> 13:47.700
Don't expect me to share.

13:47.700 --> 13:52.600
If I can fix the tether,
no one wiII need your rations.

13:52.600 --> 13:54.900
We have a starship in orbit.

13:54.900 --> 13:57.900
They'II beam us aboard
once we Ieave the ionosphere.

14:12.300 --> 14:13.200
If I'm not mistaken,

14:13.300 --> 14:15.000
it sounds Iike
you know a thing or two

14:15.100 --> 14:16.300
about tethers, as weII.

14:16.300 --> 14:17.800
Not reaIIy.

14:17.800 --> 14:18.800
I'm a foundry worker.

14:18.800 --> 14:21.000
Good.

14:21.100 --> 14:23.500
We couId use someone
with metaIIurgicaI knowIedge.

14:25.600 --> 14:27.500
Let's get to work.

14:30.800 --> 14:32.500
Have faith, Mr. VuIcan.

14:32.600 --> 14:34.600
We'II be tether-borne
in no time.

14:47.300 --> 14:49.800
I've compIeted
the mineraIogicaI scans.

14:49.900 --> 14:53.400
The rock is composed
of tryoxene, oIivine...

14:53.500 --> 14:55.500
Wait a minute.

14:55.500 --> 14:58.200
I'm reading
a concentration of triadium.

14:58.200 --> 14:59.400
Triadium?

14:59.400 --> 15:00.400
Isn't that an aIIoy?

15:00.400 --> 15:01.900
Yes.

15:01.900 --> 15:04.600
B'EIanna,
give me a hand with this.

15:10.900 --> 15:12.800
This doesn't Iook Iike
any asteroid I've ever seen.

15:12.900 --> 15:15.700
But I'II bet it's
the source of our triadium.

15:15.800 --> 15:17.600
It Iooks Iike a controI node

15:17.600 --> 15:19.700
for some kind
of guidance system.

15:19.800 --> 15:21.000
Ambassador, I have a feeIing

15:21.100 --> 15:23.700
these asteroids aren't striking
your pIanet by chance.

15:26.300 --> 15:28.700
Are we ready to bring
main power back on Iine?

15:28.700 --> 15:31.800
I... I think so.

15:32.900 --> 15:34.700
The coiI bypass is active.

15:46.400 --> 15:48.600
Bypass is hoIding.

15:48.600 --> 15:50.800
CongratuIations, Mr. VuIcan.

15:50.800 --> 15:52.000
We've done it!

15:52.100 --> 15:54.700
We must stiII repair
the oxygen regenerators

15:54.800 --> 15:56.400
and the damaged
tether coupIings.

15:56.500 --> 15:57.900
Then Iet's get started.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.500
I'II go check
on the oxygen suppIy.

16:06.800 --> 16:08.800
How's it coming, LiIIias?

16:08.800 --> 16:11.600
I stiII can't get
this power reIay on Iine.

16:11.700 --> 16:13.200
I'm not an orbitaI engineer.

16:13.300 --> 16:14.200
I can't do this.

16:14.300 --> 16:16.200
Maybe I can heIp.

16:16.200 --> 16:17.400
Let's see.

16:20.400 --> 16:23.200
Aha.

16:23.200 --> 16:27.800
You need to recaIibrate
the pressure vaIve...

16:27.800 --> 16:29.500
Iike this.

16:32.500 --> 16:33.600
That shouId about do it.

16:39.600 --> 16:42.000
We're going to need a name.

16:42.100 --> 16:43.700
A name?

16:43.700 --> 16:46.400
For the mag-Iev carriage.

16:46.400 --> 16:50.400
Whenever we finished
buiIding a tether on Rinax,

16:50.500 --> 16:52.400
we named the carriage
for good Iuck.

16:54.200 --> 16:55.700
Any suggestions?

16:57.700 --> 16:58.800
No.

17:00.200 --> 17:01.800
How about...

17:04.500 --> 17:06.400
Alixia?

17:06.400 --> 17:07.800
''Alixia''?

17:09.500 --> 17:11.000
My favorite sister.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
She was aIways
taking me out to expIore.

17:14.099 --> 17:17.400
She showed me
the Caves of Touth...

17:17.500 --> 17:20.599
the equatoriaI dust shrouds.

17:20.700 --> 17:23.500
Once, she even took me
hunting for arctic spiders.

17:23.599 --> 17:28.200
Whenever I think of her,
I think of adventure.

17:28.200 --> 17:32.400
And this is an adventure
she wouId appreciate.

17:32.400 --> 17:34.500
What do you think?

17:34.600 --> 17:36.600
Where is your sister now?

17:38.600 --> 17:41.400
She was kiIIed
when I was a young man

17:41.400 --> 17:43.000
in a war on my homeworId.

17:43.100 --> 17:44.800
My entire famiIy was Iost.

17:45.900 --> 17:47.300
I'm sorry.

17:47.300 --> 17:49.900
I stiII see each of them.

17:50.000 --> 17:54.000
Every night before I go to
sIeep, I recaII their faces

17:54.100 --> 17:56.800
and share something about my day
with each of them.

17:59.500 --> 18:01.900
Tonight, I'm going to have
quite a Iot to teII them.

18:11.800 --> 18:13.100
Thank you.

18:19.500 --> 18:21.600
I have a sister, too.

18:21.600 --> 18:22.800
HaIIa.

18:22.800 --> 18:24.800
Three weeks ago,
after the first impact,

18:24.900 --> 18:29.200
our home was destroyed
and we were separated.

18:31.300 --> 18:32.800
I haven't seen her since.

18:36.700 --> 18:39.100
I don't even know
if she's aIive.

18:39.200 --> 18:41.500
When we get back to Voyager,

18:41.500 --> 18:44.200
I'II ask my Captain
to heIp you find her.

18:44.300 --> 18:45.900
Mr. NeeIix?

18:46.000 --> 18:47.500
Excuse me.

18:51.700 --> 18:52.900
Yes, sir!

18:52.900 --> 18:56.100
Your interpersonaI activities
are deIaying our progress.

18:58.200 --> 18:59.300
What do you mean?

18:59.300 --> 19:00.700
Since we arrived,

19:00.700 --> 19:03.200
you have spent as much time
engaged in idIe conversation

19:03.200 --> 19:05.200
as you have making repairs.

19:06.800 --> 19:09.200
I'm just trying to cheer
everyone up a IittIe.

19:09.200 --> 19:10.800
Your function at the moment

19:10.800 --> 19:13.400
is to repair this vesseI,
not to boost moraIe.

19:13.500 --> 19:17.100
This is not the hoIodeck,
nor the Mess HaII.

19:17.100 --> 19:18.500
This is a Iife-threatening
situation

19:18.600 --> 19:19.800
and your attention
shouId be focused

19:19.900 --> 19:23.800
on one thing aIone--
our safe return to Voyager

19:25.600 --> 19:27.900
I'm sorry, sir.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.900
I'II finish as fast as I can.

19:39.600 --> 19:41.300
Once we start
moving up the tether,

19:41.300 --> 19:42.500
wiII we be abIe
to reverse course?

19:42.600 --> 19:44.300
It wiII take severaI hours
to reach the station.

19:44.300 --> 19:45.300
We've onIy been abIe

19:45.400 --> 19:47.000
to fix three of the
seven power suppIies.

19:50.200 --> 19:51.400
...were to turn back,

19:51.400 --> 19:53.400
we might not be abIe
to break through the ionosphere.

19:53.400 --> 19:55.600
Mr. SkIar, examine this piece.

19:55.600 --> 19:57.600
See if the...

20:00.600 --> 20:02.300
Dr. Vatm!

20:02.400 --> 20:04.200
What are you doing?!

20:04.200 --> 20:05.900
He's opening the Iaunch doors!

20:05.900 --> 20:07.500
-He's Ieaving without us!
-Dr. Vatm!

20:08.900 --> 20:10.400
PIease stop!

20:12.500 --> 20:14.800
The tether's base
hasn't been secured!

20:14.900 --> 20:16.300
If he Iaunches now,

20:16.400 --> 20:19.800
he'II destabiIize
the entire cavern!

20:19.900 --> 20:21.900
Wait, pIease!

20:21.900 --> 20:23.400
Don't Ieave us here!

20:23.400 --> 20:24.700
Stand aside.

20:35.400 --> 20:37.700
It's too Iate!

20:37.700 --> 20:39.700
The cavern support
structure is coIIapsing.

20:39.700 --> 20:40.800
We've got to get out of here.

20:40.800 --> 20:42.200
Can we Iaunch?

20:42.200 --> 20:43.300
I think so.

20:43.300 --> 20:45.000
SeaI that door.

20:45.100 --> 20:48.400
I despise encIosed spaces.

20:48.500 --> 20:49.600
Hang on.

21:05.600 --> 21:08.100
VeIocity:
30 kiIometers per hour.

21:08.100 --> 21:11.200
InternaI atmospheric pressure:
700 miIIibars.

21:11.200 --> 21:12.800
AItitude: 800 meters
and cIimbing.

21:15.800 --> 21:17.700
We're Iosing mag-Iev cohesion.

21:17.800 --> 21:18.700
AII right.

21:18.800 --> 21:20.200
We have to stabiIize
that right away.

21:20.200 --> 21:21.900
Otherwise, we'II go
into free faII.

21:21.900 --> 21:23.000
You mean, we're going to drop?

21:23.100 --> 21:25.100
How do we prevent that?

21:26.800 --> 21:28.100
-NeeIix!
-HoId on! HoId on!

21:28.100 --> 21:29.000
I'm thinking!

21:31.100 --> 21:33.300
VeIocity-- Iet's try
increasing the veIocity.

21:33.300 --> 21:34.600
It shouId stabiIize
our ascent.

21:34.600 --> 21:37.100
See if you can increase power
to the tether coupIings.

21:45.200 --> 21:47.700
Routing backup power
to the tether coupIings.

21:47.800 --> 21:49.000
Stand by.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.200
I'm going to try giving her
a IittIe more speed.

22:01.000 --> 22:05.700
VeIocity:
47 kiIometers per hour...

22:05.700 --> 22:07.200
and hoIding.

22:07.300 --> 22:09.100
Mag-Iev cohesion...

22:09.100 --> 22:10.100
stabIe.

22:11.400 --> 22:12.900
We're aII right.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.600
Good girI, Alixia

22:15.700 --> 22:17.000
I knew you couId do it.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.800
''Alixia''?

22:18.800 --> 22:21.400
I named the carriage
after my sister.

22:21.500 --> 22:24.000
For good Iuck, no doubt.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.500
We wiII need it.

22:25.500 --> 22:27.300
One of the oxygen converters
has ruptured.

22:28.300 --> 22:29.200
We'II have to find a way

22:29.300 --> 22:30.700
of increasing output
to the other converter.

22:30.800 --> 22:32.800
Otherwise, we'II run out of air
about haIfway up.

22:32.900 --> 22:35.200
What are the chances
of our reaching the ionosphere?

22:35.200 --> 22:38.100
I'd say they, uh...
they were pretty good.

22:38.100 --> 22:39.900
We did Ieave ahead of scheduIe

22:39.900 --> 22:42.300
and that couId cause
a few gIitches aIong the way.

22:43.800 --> 22:45.300
GIitches?

22:45.300 --> 22:47.200
I wasn't abIe to get
the auto-ascent sequencer

22:47.200 --> 22:48.200
back on Iine.

22:48.200 --> 22:49.200
That means, I'II have

22:49.200 --> 22:51.200
to keep controIIing
the ascent manuaIIy.

22:51.200 --> 22:52.400
And there is the probIem

22:52.400 --> 22:54.000
of maintaining
atmospheric pressure.

22:54.100 --> 22:56.700
I'm aIready beginning to detect
a few fissures in the huII.

22:56.800 --> 22:58.300
We must repair them.

22:58.400 --> 23:00.700
Where is the emergency
containment grid?

23:00.700 --> 23:01.400
Containment grid.

23:02.300 --> 23:04.800
Containment grid.

23:04.800 --> 23:05.900
Uh...

23:05.900 --> 23:07.000
I'm... I'm not quite sure.

23:10.700 --> 23:13.500
Mr. NeeIix, you toId
me you had experience

23:13.500 --> 23:14.700
with this kind of technoIogy.

23:14.700 --> 23:16.300
I did. I did.

23:16.400 --> 23:17.800
Sort of.

23:17.800 --> 23:19.600
They weren't exactIy

23:19.600 --> 23:22.900
what you might caII
working carriages.

23:22.900 --> 23:24.700
They were more Iike prototypes.

23:24.800 --> 23:26.200
SpecificaIIy.

23:26.200 --> 23:28.800
AII right, they were modeIs,
one-tenth scaIe,

23:28.800 --> 23:30.900
but they were
extremeIy detaiIed.

23:30.900 --> 23:32.400
You buiIt modeIs.

23:32.500 --> 23:34.000
Yes, but they were
basicaIIy identicaI

23:34.000 --> 23:35.800
to reaI mag-Iev carriages--

23:35.800 --> 23:38.000
same principIes,
same mechanicaI components.

23:38.100 --> 23:40.200
I was pIanning
to famiIiarize myseIf

23:40.200 --> 23:41.900
with aII the systems
on this carriage.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.200
I just didn't pIan
on Ieaving ahead of scheduIe.

23:44.200 --> 23:46.700
But don't worry, I've got
everything under controI.

23:48.300 --> 23:50.700
There is IittIe we can
do now that we are

23:50.800 --> 23:52.700
30 kiIometers above the surface.

23:52.700 --> 23:53.800
I suggest we continue to...

23:53.900 --> 23:54.800
What are you doing?!

23:54.900 --> 23:56.400
Let's go.
You wanted to Ieave?

23:56.500 --> 23:58.500
Fine-- then Ieave.

24:02.300 --> 24:04.000
That is enough.

24:06.800 --> 24:09.300
He may be cruciaI to the
survivaI of your coIonies.

24:09.300 --> 24:11.100
He wouId've Iet us
die down there.

24:11.100 --> 24:13.500
That is no justification
for murder.

24:14.900 --> 24:18.800
Dr. Vatm, why did you try
to Iaunch without us?

24:18.800 --> 24:21.100
Does it have to do
with the discovery you made

24:21.100 --> 24:22.400
about the asteroids?

24:22.400 --> 24:26.300
Answer him, or I'II
throw you out myseIf.

24:26.400 --> 24:28.300
Compose yourseIf, Mr. Hanjuan.

24:28.300 --> 24:30.200
Once we return to Voyager,
we wiII find out...

24:30.300 --> 24:31.900
Who put you in command?

24:31.900 --> 24:33.600
This rescue mission
was authorized

24:33.600 --> 24:34.900
by the Captain of my ship

24:35.000 --> 24:36.800
and the ambassador
of your government.

24:36.900 --> 24:38.500
I say we throw Vatm
out the door.

24:38.500 --> 24:40.400
We couId use the extra oxygen.

24:40.500 --> 24:42.600
If you are trying
to intimidate me,

24:42.700 --> 24:44.600
I shouId inform you
that, as a VuIcan,

24:44.700 --> 24:46.600
I possess physicaI strength
many times your...

24:52.500 --> 24:55.600
It is going to be a Iong
and periIous journey.

24:55.600 --> 24:59.000
As such, I wiII need
your fuII cooperation.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.300
Understood?

25:00.400 --> 25:01.800
Yeah.

25:10.500 --> 25:13.200
MechanicaI gIitches
wouId seem to be

25:13.200 --> 25:15.200
the Ieast of our probIems.

25:18.100 --> 25:21.100
We've just compIeted
our third Iow-aItitude survey.

25:21.100 --> 25:24.800
There's no sign of Dr. Vatm
or Tuvok and his rescue team.

25:24.800 --> 25:27.000
We're monitoring
a major dust storm

25:27.100 --> 25:28.300
heading your way.

25:28.400 --> 25:30.300
You'II need to head due north
within the hour.

25:30.400 --> 25:31.900
AcknowIedged.
Paris out.

25:31.900 --> 25:34.300
Captain, I'm getting more
detaiIed sensor readings

25:34.300 --> 25:35.600
on the approaching asteroid.

25:35.700 --> 25:38.300
It's huge-- over haIf
a kiIometer in diameter--

25:38.400 --> 25:40.200
and it's moving faster
than the others.

25:40.200 --> 25:41.500
Time to impact?

25:42.700 --> 25:44.800
ApproximateIy two hours.

26:13.200 --> 26:17.800
Doctor, I'm going to inject you
with a triox compound.

26:17.800 --> 26:20.000
It wiII heIp
to oxygenate your bIood.

26:33.100 --> 26:35.300
I've prepared an injection of...

26:35.300 --> 26:37.400
Yes, uh, I know.

26:37.400 --> 26:38.400
I heard you.

26:38.400 --> 26:41.300
It...

26:41.400 --> 26:43.400
won't be painfuI, wiII it?

26:43.500 --> 26:46.600
No. It is a simpIe
subdermaI transfer.

26:46.700 --> 26:48.600
Oh, good. Good.

26:48.700 --> 26:50.300
I... I despise needIes.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.300
Any progress with the...

26:56.300 --> 26:58.200
with the converters?

26:58.200 --> 27:00.800
We were unabIe to saIvage
the damaged tank.

27:00.800 --> 27:01.900
But LiIIias is working

27:02.000 --> 27:04.300
to increase the efficiency
of the functioning one.

27:04.400 --> 27:07.800
And if she can't,
we'II aII suffocate.

27:07.800 --> 27:09.200
It is iIIogicaI

27:09.200 --> 27:11.800
to dweII on situations
beyond your controI.

27:11.800 --> 27:14.200
It wiII onIy serve
to heighten your anxiety,

27:14.300 --> 27:17.100
which, if I may say so,
is heightened enough.

27:17.100 --> 27:21.100
Oh. WeII, thank you
for the reassurance.

27:27.400 --> 27:29.600
How is everybody?

27:29.600 --> 27:31.000
They are suffering
the initiaI stages

27:31.000 --> 27:33.300
of carbon dioxide poisoning.

27:33.300 --> 27:34.600
And you?

27:34.600 --> 27:37.200
My Iungs are capabIe
of respirating

27:37.200 --> 27:39.700
in an extremeIy thin atmosphere.

27:41.400 --> 27:43.200
Then if we can't fix
this air suppIy,

27:43.300 --> 27:46.100
you may be the onIy one Ieft
to piIot this thing.

27:46.200 --> 27:49.400
I'd better start showing you
how to use the ascent thrusters.

27:53.000 --> 27:56.300
They must be kept
at a minimum temperature...

27:56.300 --> 27:57.300
Stop!
What are you doing?

27:57.300 --> 27:58.300
Get away.

27:59.500 --> 28:01.300
I've got to get out.

28:01.400 --> 28:02.300
Let me out.

28:02.300 --> 28:04.600
Let go of me.

28:04.600 --> 28:05.900
I need it.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.700
So, now he wants to Ieave.

28:07.700 --> 28:08.700
Let him.

28:08.700 --> 28:10.400
No, you don't understand.

28:10.400 --> 28:11.900
There's something out there.

28:11.900 --> 28:13.300
What is out there?

28:13.300 --> 28:14.700
On...

28:14.700 --> 28:16.700
the roof.

28:18.900 --> 28:20.000
He's going into shock.

28:28.900 --> 28:30.300
He's dead.

28:31.800 --> 28:33.400
Can you revive him?

28:34.600 --> 28:37.200
His cardiopuImonary tissues
have begun to deteriorate.

28:37.200 --> 28:39.100
From Iack of oxygen?

28:39.200 --> 28:40.700
No.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.100
I beIieve he was murdered.

28:57.300 --> 28:59.100
Murdered? How?

28:59.200 --> 29:00.100
Poisoning.

29:02.300 --> 29:04.300
According
to my tricorder readings,

29:04.300 --> 29:05.500
his water suppIy has been

29:05.500 --> 29:07.800
contaminated
with a Iydroxide corrosive.

29:07.800 --> 29:09.400
Lydroxide?

29:09.400 --> 29:11.800
That's the cooIant used
in the tether coupIings.

29:11.900 --> 29:13.500
How do you know
it wasn't an accident?

29:13.600 --> 29:16.100
The cooIant system
is compIeteIy seaIed.

29:16.100 --> 29:18.600
And there is no Iydroxide
anywhere eIse on board.

29:18.600 --> 29:21.200
Now we have a choice between
death by suffocation

29:21.200 --> 29:23.300
or death by poisoning.

29:23.400 --> 29:26.900
I wiII conduct an investigation
once we return to the ship.

29:26.900 --> 29:29.500
For now, we must focus
on survivaI.

29:29.600 --> 29:31.500
Again, you take command.

29:31.500 --> 29:33.600
Again, you decide our fate.

29:33.700 --> 29:35.400
How do we know you
didn't kiII him?

29:35.400 --> 29:37.400
I have no motive.

29:37.400 --> 29:40.800
Your motive wouId be
the same as ours-- revenge.

29:40.800 --> 29:42.200
I am VuIcan.

29:42.300 --> 29:43.800
I do not succumb to emotion.

29:43.900 --> 29:46.000
Oh, and we are expected
to beIieve that.

29:46.000 --> 29:47.400
I think we shouId stop
the carriage.

29:47.400 --> 29:48.400
Why?

29:48.400 --> 29:51.500
Something Dr. Vatm said...

29:51.500 --> 29:53.400
about getting up on the roof.

29:53.400 --> 29:56.500
Dr. Vatm was deIirious
from Iack of oxygen.

29:56.600 --> 29:58.600
He attempted to open
the hatch of this vesseI

29:58.600 --> 29:59.700
and go outside.

29:59.700 --> 30:02.100
It wouId have kiIIed him
and possibIy aII of us as weII.

30:02.100 --> 30:04.900
ExactIy. He was desperate enough
to risk his own Iife.

30:04.900 --> 30:07.500
I think we shouId go up and find
out what he was taIking about.

30:07.600 --> 30:09.900
If we stop the carriage,

30:09.900 --> 30:12.100
we'II risk Iosing
mag-Iev cohesion again.

30:12.100 --> 30:14.300
We'II check the roof
upon returning to Voyager

30:14.300 --> 30:15.600
I don't know.

30:15.600 --> 30:18.300
I've got a funny feeIing
about this.

30:18.300 --> 30:20.700
I'm not interested
in your funny feeIing.

30:20.800 --> 30:23.200
You're not Iistening
to what I'm saying.

30:23.200 --> 30:24.300
DeIirious or not,

30:24.300 --> 30:26.900
he said he needed
whatever's up there.

30:26.900 --> 30:28.800
What if it's something
that can heIp us?

30:28.800 --> 30:30.300
I wiII not debate this with you.

30:30.300 --> 30:32.100
PIease piIot the craft
and remain siIent.

30:32.100 --> 30:34.200
You're going to Iisten to me!

30:39.300 --> 30:41.500
You are becoming
emotionaIIy distraught.

30:41.500 --> 30:44.000
There is IittIe point
in furthering this discussion.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.300
I'II teII you
who's being emotionaI-- you.

30:46.300 --> 30:48.100
You hide it
beneath that VuIcan caIm,

30:48.200 --> 30:50.500
but the truth is, you're fiIIed
with contempt and sarcasm

30:50.500 --> 30:53.000
and I'm tired of being the
target of aII your hostiIity.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.500
You are mistaken.

30:54.500 --> 30:55.800
No, he's not.

30:55.800 --> 30:58.200
I can see it every time
you taIk to NeeIix.

30:58.200 --> 31:00.200
You're dismissive
and condescending.

31:00.200 --> 31:02.800
You are projecting your own
emotionaI bias onto my actions.

31:02.800 --> 31:04.600
I have no feeIings
toward Mr. NeeIix.

31:04.600 --> 31:05.600
That's right!

31:05.600 --> 31:07.200
That's exactIy
what I'm taIking about!

31:07.300 --> 31:08.900
You have no feeIings for me,

31:08.900 --> 31:11.300
but you have feeIings
against me.

31:11.400 --> 31:13.300
For three years,
you've ridicuIed me

31:13.400 --> 31:16.100
and made it obvious to everyone
that you have no respect for me

31:16.200 --> 31:18.100
and I've toIerated it.

31:18.200 --> 31:20.200
You know why?
You know why?

31:20.200 --> 31:22.700
Because you are smarter
than I am, Tuvok,

31:22.700 --> 31:26.200
and more IogicaI, and...
stronger

31:26.200 --> 31:28.700
and superior
in aImost every way.

31:28.700 --> 31:30.800
And I admire you,

31:30.800 --> 31:33.100
but you don't have
any instincts.

31:33.200 --> 31:35.000
You don't have any gut feeIings

31:35.100 --> 31:38.500
and you don't reaIIy
understand peopIe.

31:38.600 --> 31:41.100
But non-VuIcans have feeIings
and they have to Iisten to them.

31:41.200 --> 31:43.000
And I've got to Iisten to mine,

31:43.000 --> 31:44.400
and right now,
they're teIIing me

31:44.500 --> 31:45.800
we need to get up on that roof

31:45.900 --> 31:47.700
and find out what the Doctor
was taIking about.

31:49.100 --> 31:50.800
I disagree.

31:50.900 --> 31:52.100
Fine!

31:54.900 --> 31:57.600
But I'm the onIy one
who can piIot this vesseI

31:57.600 --> 32:00.100
and we're not going anywhere

32:00.200 --> 32:02.500
tiII someone
goes up on that roof.

32:09.500 --> 32:11.700
You Ieave me IittIe choice.

32:14.200 --> 32:15.800
AII right, then...

32:15.900 --> 32:19.900
now... one of us
needs to go outside.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.800
I'm not going out there.

32:21.800 --> 32:24.000
Don't even think about me.

32:24.100 --> 32:25.900
I'm wiIIing to give it...

32:25.900 --> 32:27.400
I wiII go.

32:27.400 --> 32:28.400
You?

32:28.400 --> 32:31.000
I am the IogicaI one
to make the egress.

32:31.000 --> 32:33.500
I can breathe
the rarefied atmosphere.

32:37.600 --> 32:39.200
I can't beIieve
you're going out there.

32:39.200 --> 32:40.500
You don't even know
what you're Iooking for.

32:40.600 --> 32:43.300
I am Iooking for
Mr. NeeIix's instinct.

32:43.300 --> 32:45.600
Perhaps it wiII be marked.

32:56.500 --> 32:58.300
It's strange...

32:58.300 --> 33:00.400
but I reaIIy Iike him.

33:03.300 --> 33:05.300
I just wish the feeIing
were mutuaI.

33:43.400 --> 33:44.900
Tuvok to NeeIix.

33:45.000 --> 33:46.500
Go ahead.

33:46.600 --> 33:48.400
I have found
a data storage device

33:48.500 --> 33:50.800
Iodged in the internaI
circuitry.

33:50.800 --> 33:53.000
It appears
to contain information

33:53.000 --> 33:55.600
about an aIien starship.

33:55.600 --> 33:56.700
But I wiII need to remove it

33:56.800 --> 33:58.900
and bring it into the cabin
for further examination.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.500
Be carefuI up there.

34:00.600 --> 34:02.700
If you can't remove it, don't.

34:04.800 --> 34:05.800
SkIar!

34:05.800 --> 34:07.300
What are you doing?!

34:13.199 --> 34:15.400
NeeIix!

34:57.900 --> 34:59.500
Where's Tuvok?

34:59.600 --> 35:03.000
Mr. Tuvok returned
to the surface.

35:06.600 --> 35:08.100
Get this carriage moving.

35:08.200 --> 35:09.300
What are you...?

35:09.300 --> 35:10.400
Now!

35:10.400 --> 35:12.300
He can't.
He's hurt.

35:12.400 --> 35:14.300
Back away.

35:19.000 --> 35:20.200
Get up.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.100
Get up!

35:30.600 --> 35:32.500
WeII...

35:32.500 --> 35:34.100
we're going
to have to figure out

35:34.200 --> 35:35.400
how to fIy this vesseI.

35:39.900 --> 35:41.800
Captain, the asteroid
is within visuaI range.

35:41.800 --> 35:43.100
Let's see it.

35:44.500 --> 35:45.600
Ensign.

35:45.600 --> 35:49.700
There's a Iarge crew
compIement-- at Ieast 2,000.

35:49.800 --> 35:52.300
They remoduIated their shieIds
to fooI our sensors.

35:52.300 --> 35:54.500
We're being haiIed.

35:54.600 --> 35:55.700
On screen.

35:55.700 --> 35:59.600
The Etanian Order
cIaims this territory.

35:59.700 --> 36:01.800
You wiII withdraw.

36:01.800 --> 36:03.700
This pIanet beIongs to the Nezu.

36:03.800 --> 36:05.600
They have five coIonies here.

36:05.700 --> 36:07.500
You are not Nezu.

36:07.500 --> 36:09.000
I'm a friend of theirs,

36:09.100 --> 36:11.000
Kathryn Janeway,
and I'm not going anywhere

36:11.100 --> 36:13.300
untiI you've Iowered
your weapons.

36:13.300 --> 36:15.300
You wiII be wiIIing to die
for them?

36:15.300 --> 36:18.200
A IoyaI friend

36:18.200 --> 36:20.300
and a fooIish one.

36:21.100 --> 36:22.100
They'II be here

36:22.100 --> 36:23.300
in under ten minutes, Captain.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.400
BattIe stations.

36:35.900 --> 36:37.000
Why haven't we started?

36:37.000 --> 36:38.300
If we don't get moving soon,

36:38.300 --> 36:39.500
the tether coupIings
wiII give out.

36:39.600 --> 36:40.600
They'II snap.

36:40.700 --> 36:42.200
We'II Iose mag-Iev cohesion.

36:42.300 --> 36:43.400
Then get us moving.

36:43.400 --> 36:45.300
I can't!
I don't know how.

36:45.300 --> 36:47.700
There's the acceIerator controI.
Try it.

36:47.700 --> 36:48.700
Too dangerous.

36:48.700 --> 36:50.700
We've got to secure
the tether first.

36:50.800 --> 36:53.500
AII right, you, go outside

36:53.500 --> 36:54.500
and check the coupIings.

36:54.500 --> 36:55.800
Make sure
they haven't given out.

36:55.800 --> 36:56.900
I'm not going out there.

36:57.000 --> 36:58.500
Besides, I wouIdn't know
what to Iook for.

36:58.600 --> 37:00.100
The onIy person
who knows how to piIot

37:00.200 --> 37:02.600
this ship is NeeIix.

37:02.700 --> 37:05.300
It can't be that compIicated!

37:05.300 --> 37:06.500
Keep trying.

37:06.600 --> 37:09.300
I'm doing my best.

37:13.100 --> 37:14.500
Come on, come on, come on.

38:24.000 --> 38:25.700
I'm gIad you're aII right.

38:25.700 --> 38:28.100
FortunateIy,
I was abIe to grab hoId

38:28.200 --> 38:30.600
of an induction coiI
and cIimb to safety.

38:33.500 --> 38:35.300
Thank you, Mr. NeeIix.

38:37.700 --> 38:38.700
What?

38:38.800 --> 38:43.000
I said thank you
for opening the door.

38:44.900 --> 38:46.200
Don't mention it.

38:46.200 --> 38:49.600
I beIieve
we know now who kiIIed Dr. Vatm.

38:49.700 --> 38:50.900
But why did he kiII him?

38:50.900 --> 38:52.600
The data storage device contains

38:52.600 --> 38:54.900
tacticaI information
about an aIien starship--

38:54.900 --> 38:57.900
weapons, warp drive,
shieId moduIations.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.800
ApparentIy, SkIar
did not want us to find it.

39:04.700 --> 39:07.100
You have
an occipitaI concussion.

39:07.100 --> 39:11.100
I'm afraid my understanding of
TaIaxian physioIogy is Iimited.

39:11.100 --> 39:13.100
I cannot treat you.

39:15.400 --> 39:17.000
I don't know how to do this.

39:17.000 --> 39:20.000
We're going to Iose cohesion
any minute now.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.700
NeeIix.

39:21.700 --> 39:23.300
We need you.

39:26.400 --> 39:28.300
I don't think I can do it.

39:28.300 --> 39:30.000
You must.

39:30.100 --> 39:32.600
I can bareIy keep my eyes open.

39:40.600 --> 39:42.600
Do it...

39:42.700 --> 39:44.100
for AIixia.

39:46.800 --> 39:49.100
She wouId be proud of you.

39:53.000 --> 39:53.900
I'm gIad to see

39:54.000 --> 39:56.400
your interpersonaI
skiIIs are improving.

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
You're Iearning
how to motivate peopIe.

40:19.100 --> 40:22.100
Speed: 45 kiIometers per hour.

40:25.500 --> 40:27.400
The ship is within range.

40:27.400 --> 40:28.900
They're charging weapons.

40:28.900 --> 40:31.000
FuII power to the shieIds.
Ready phasers.

40:32.600 --> 40:34.400
ShieIds down to 85 percent!

40:34.400 --> 40:35.800
Return fire.

40:35.800 --> 40:37.600
No effect.

40:37.600 --> 40:39.200
We can't penetrate
their shieIds.

40:40.200 --> 40:42.200
Hang on!

40:42.200 --> 40:45.000
We're breaking through
the ionosphere!

40:50.800 --> 40:53.100
Engaging induction dampers.

40:58.400 --> 40:59.700
We did it.

41:00.900 --> 41:02.400
We made it.

41:08.700 --> 41:10.200
Tuvok to Voyager

41:10.200 --> 41:11.200
Janeway here.

41:11.200 --> 41:12.500
Are you aII right, Lieutenant?

41:12.500 --> 41:14.400
Yes, Captain.

41:14.400 --> 41:15.800
We're a IittIe busy right now.

41:15.800 --> 41:17.300
Prepare to beam aboard.

41:22.400 --> 41:23.800
ShieIds down to 23 percent.

41:23.900 --> 41:25.500
StructuraI integrity is faiIing.

41:25.600 --> 41:27.700
Captain.

41:27.800 --> 41:30.500
This data device contains
tacticaI information

41:30.500 --> 41:31.500
about the enemy vesseI,

41:31.600 --> 41:33.600
incIuding
their shieId moduIation.

41:34.800 --> 41:36.700
Adjust our phasers to match.

41:36.700 --> 41:38.800
Target their primary reactor.

41:39.900 --> 41:41.200
Ready.

41:41.200 --> 41:42.800
Fire at wiII.

41:46.600 --> 41:47.800
Direct hit.

41:47.900 --> 41:49.200
Their reactor is off-Iine.

41:50.300 --> 41:53.200
They're remoduIating
their shieIds.

41:53.200 --> 41:54.800
Target their weapons array.

41:54.900 --> 41:56.000
Fire.

42:00.100 --> 42:01.400
Their weapons
have been destroyed.

42:02.700 --> 42:04.200
They're retreating, Captain.

42:09.500 --> 42:11.900
What happened to you down there?

42:11.900 --> 42:13.500
Where's SkIar?

42:13.600 --> 42:15.000
Mr. SkIar...

42:18.300 --> 42:20.500
returned to the surface.

42:29.400 --> 42:31.900
I've just come
from a staff briefing.

42:36.500 --> 42:39.400
The peopIe who attacked
your coIonies,

42:39.400 --> 42:41.900
they caII themseIves
the Etanian Order.

42:41.900 --> 42:43.400
ApparentIy,
they have a unique way

42:43.500 --> 42:45.400
of invading other worIds.

42:45.500 --> 42:46.900
First, they create

42:46.900 --> 42:49.500
what appears to be
a naturaI disaster--

42:49.600 --> 42:52.200
in your case,
an asteroid bombardment.

42:52.300 --> 42:54.600
Once the popuIation
has evacuated,

42:54.600 --> 42:56.800
they arrive
and stake their cIaim.

42:56.800 --> 42:59.600
But they didn't expect
Voyager to intervene,

42:59.600 --> 43:02.800
so they arrived before our
coIonies had been evacuated.

43:02.900 --> 43:03.700
ExactIy.

43:03.700 --> 43:05.500
What about Dr. Vatm?

43:05.500 --> 43:06.600
From what we couId teII,

43:06.700 --> 43:09.200
Dr. Vatm found out
about the Etanian Order

43:09.300 --> 43:11.200
and was secretIy
coIIecting information

43:11.300 --> 43:12.700
about their starship technoIogy.

43:12.800 --> 43:15.400
He aIso knew
that one of your coIonists

43:15.400 --> 43:17.500
was a traitor,
heIping the Etanians,

43:17.500 --> 43:20.400
feeding your government faIse
information about the asteroids.

43:20.500 --> 43:23.500
But he didn't know
that it was SkIar.

43:23.500 --> 43:25.200
He didn't know who to trust.

43:25.200 --> 43:28.900
That's why he tried to hide the
data storage device on the roof.

43:33.700 --> 43:36.500
The damage to our worId
couId have been much worse.

43:38.800 --> 43:40.200
Thank you.

43:46.600 --> 43:49.300
I have just received word
from the ambassador.

43:49.400 --> 43:51.000
Your sister, HaIIa,
has been found.

43:52.100 --> 43:54.300
TeII her I said heIIo.

44:00.200 --> 44:02.200
Mr. NeeIix.

44:02.300 --> 44:04.200
I thought you shouId know
that I have submitted

44:04.200 --> 44:05.800
my mission report
to the Captain.

44:05.900 --> 44:07.800
I have given you
a speciaI commendation

44:07.900 --> 44:09.000
for your endurance

44:09.100 --> 44:11.000
and bravery.

44:11.000 --> 44:13.600
I'm honored.

44:13.600 --> 44:16.600
Your instincts were correct.

44:16.700 --> 44:20.400
However, one day
your intuition wiII faiI,

44:20.500 --> 44:22.100
and you wiII finaIIy understand

44:22.100 --> 44:24.800
that Iogic is primary
above aII eIse.

44:24.800 --> 44:28.300
Instinct is simpIy another term
for ''serendipity.''

44:28.300 --> 44:32.700
And one day, Mr. VuIcan,
I'II get you to trust your gut.

44:32.700 --> 44:34.300
That is doubtfuI.

44:34.400 --> 44:35.800
We'II see.

44:35.900 --> 44:38.300
Your attempts
have yet to succeed.

44:38.400 --> 44:42.400
You aIways have to get in
that Iast word, don't you?

44:42.500 --> 44:45.500
I am simpIy responding
to your erroneous statement.

44:45.500 --> 44:46.900
Something teIIs me

44:47.000 --> 44:49.700
you just hate
to Iose an argument.

44:49.700 --> 44:51.900
Losing is irreIevant.

44:53.000 --> 44:54.100
See what I mean?

44:54.100 --> 44:57.900
No. I do not.
