01:05.649 --> 01:07.608
Oh, hello.

01:29.423 --> 01:33.968
Jean Francois?

02:07.211 --> 02:08.336
Jean Francois.

02:37.741 --> 02:40.868
You in the robes. Put down
the weapon of mass destruction

02:40.994 --> 02:44.121
and get on the ground.
You're under arrest.

02:56.885 --> 02:59.011
Put down your weapons now!

03:00.597 --> 03:02.765
Why can't they ever do this
the easy way?

03:12.442 --> 03:14.485
World Police. Get down on the ground!

03:24.079 --> 03:26.122
Hey, terrorist.

03:27.207 --> 03:29.333
Terrorize this.

03:40.345 --> 03:42.805
All right, let's make this interesting.

04:10.709 --> 04:12.418
You lose.

04:14.713 --> 04:17.882
- He's getting away with the WMD!
- I got him.

04:30.187 --> 04:31.354
Damn, I missed him.

04:31.480 --> 04:33.856
Sarah, he's got the bomb. You got a fix?

04:35.651 --> 04:38.277
I got him, Carson.
He's heading for the Louvre.

04:40.155 --> 04:41.530
Your plans are over.

04:53.543 --> 04:55.711
- All right, Sarah.
- Yeah, all right, team!

04:55.796 --> 04:57.546
Nothing to it.

04:57.756 --> 04:59.840
All right.

05:02.010 --> 05:05.972
Bonjour, everyone. Don't worry.
Everything is bon.

05:06.056 --> 05:08.015
We stopped the terrorists.

05:19.236 --> 05:21.988
I was doing a lot of thinking
on the ride over here.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.781
Oh, yeah? About what?

05:24.241 --> 05:27.910
I was thinking that I want you
to marry me.

05:28.537 --> 05:31.497
- Don't joke about that.
- Who's joking?

05:35.252 --> 05:38.379
Joe to Sarah. Looks like we may
need to order up a wedding cake.

05:38.505 --> 05:42.174
- He finally popped the question?
- Lisa, you're an amazing woman.

05:42.259 --> 05:46.595
And a damn fine cop. And I want
to spend the rest of my life with you.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.765
Oh, Carson. Carson...

05:52.352 --> 05:54.687
Carson!

05:59.985 --> 06:01.277
No!

06:07.284 --> 06:08.534
Carson.

06:08.994 --> 06:13.539
- Feel so cold.
- You have to hang on, Carson.

06:14.416 --> 06:17.626
Sorry, babe. Looks like this
was a one-way ticket.

06:18.003 --> 06:19.003
No.

06:20.464 --> 06:23.049
Lisa, you have to live on.

06:23.133 --> 06:26.969
Find someone else who will love you.
Find someone else and be happy.

06:27.262 --> 06:29.472
You deserve...

06:33.685 --> 06:40.483
No!

07:04.007 --> 07:06.175
Everyone has AIDS

07:07.135 --> 07:09.053
AIDS, AIDS, AIDS

07:09.679 --> 07:12.306
AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS
AIDS, AIDS

07:12.599 --> 07:14.391
Everyone has AIDS

07:17.062 --> 07:19.647
And so this is the end of our story

07:20.315 --> 07:22.858
And everyone is dead from AIDS

07:23.485 --> 07:26.237
It took from me my best friend

07:26.321 --> 07:29.031
My only true pal

07:29.116 --> 07:30.866
My only bright star

07:31.034 --> 07:32.451
He died of AIDS

07:32.536 --> 07:34.870
Well, I'm gonna march on Washington

07:35.038 --> 07:37.206
Lead the fight
And charge the brigades

07:38.416 --> 07:40.376
There's a hero inside of all of us

07:41.086 --> 07:43.712
I'll make them see
Everyone has AIDS

07:43.880 --> 07:45.047
- My father
- AIDS

07:45.132 --> 07:46.632
- My sister
- AIDS

07:46.716 --> 07:48.467
My uncle and my cousin
And her best friend

07:48.552 --> 07:49.802
AIDS, AIDS, AIDS

07:49.886 --> 07:53.139
The gays and the straights
And the whites and the spades

07:53.223 --> 07:56.600
Everyone has AIDS
My grandma and my dog Ole Blue

07:56.726 --> 08:00.312
- AIDS, AIDS, AIDS
- The Pope has got it and so do you

08:00.397 --> 08:03.190
Come on, everybody
We got quilting to do

08:03.275 --> 08:05.442
We're gonna break down
These barricades

08:05.527 --> 08:08.070
Everyone has
AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS

08:08.155 --> 08:10.573
AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS
AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS

08:10.657 --> 08:12.283
AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS
AIDS, AIDS

08:21.543 --> 08:24.253
- Great job, Gary.
- Thanks. You, too, Steve.

08:24.421 --> 08:26.380
That was the greatest acting
I've ever seen.

08:26.506 --> 08:28.257
I just don't know how you do it, Gary.

08:28.425 --> 08:30.301
How do you make yourself
so somber and emotional

08:30.427 --> 08:31.886
to make everybody cry like that?

08:32.011 --> 08:37.558
It's not that hard, really. I just think
about the saddest moment in my life.

08:41.855 --> 08:45.774
Man, wow. Gary is such a great guy.

08:52.657 --> 08:55.242
Gary. Oh, no. Help me! Help me!

08:55.327 --> 08:59.163
Get off of me!
Get this thing off of me! Gary!

08:59.706 --> 09:03.959
Hello, young man. Congratulations
on a terrific performance.

09:04.127 --> 09:07.171
Oh, thank you.
I don't believe we've met, Mr...?

09:08.131 --> 09:10.758
The name is Spottswoode.

09:12.928 --> 09:16.055
- Well, nice to meet you.
- And you are Gary Johnston.

09:16.181 --> 09:19.600
All-American actor who graduated
Iowa University summa cum laude

09:19.684 --> 09:22.561
with a double major in theatre
and world languages.

09:22.646 --> 09:25.439
You've been at the top of every
acting class since you were a child.

09:25.523 --> 09:27.983
Top-gun actor.

09:29.653 --> 09:32.238
Hey, hold on a second,
are you from Hollywood?

09:32.572 --> 09:37.993
I have an incredible offer for you, Gary.
If you're interested, follow me this way.

09:56.429 --> 09:59.640
Please, Gary, step into my car.

10:02.352 --> 10:03.686
Oh, I get it.

10:04.020 --> 10:06.647
I'm supposed to get in your car
and let you put your finger inside me.

10:06.773 --> 10:09.024
Then if I go down on you,
I get a movie part.

10:10.193 --> 10:13.028
No, I just want to show you something.

10:13.196 --> 10:14.363
Yeah, I'll bet you do.

10:14.489 --> 10:16.573
Please, Gary, I'm not from Hollywood.

10:16.658 --> 10:20.202
I'm not going to fuck your mouth,
and my time is extremely valuable.

10:31.298 --> 10:34.508
- Jesus, this is a nice limo.
- Yes, it is.

10:34.801 --> 10:36.885
Now, suck my cock.

10:38.263 --> 10:39.555
Just kidding.

10:47.188 --> 10:49.857
All right, just what the hell
is this about?

10:49.983 --> 10:52.526
I hate to break this to you, Gary,

10:52.819 --> 10:55.237
but some people out there
want you dead.

10:55.864 --> 10:58.073
- Dead?
- They're called terrorists, Gary.

10:58.241 --> 11:00.242
And they hate everything about you.

11:01.244 --> 11:04.747
Why? What did I do to them?
I'm just a Broadway actor.

11:04.873 --> 11:07.416
It's not who you are, Gary,
it's what you stand for.

11:07.584 --> 11:09.710
And every single minute
of every single day,

11:09.794 --> 11:11.462
the terrorists are planning new ways

11:11.588 --> 11:15.215
to kill you and everyone else
who lives in a free country.

11:15.800 --> 11:19.928
The only thing standing
in their way is us.

11:20.930 --> 11:22.097
You?

11:22.766 --> 11:26.101
Baxter, I think we can
valmorphanize safely now.

11:58.802 --> 12:02.679
Okay, a limousine that can fly.
Now I have seen everything.

12:02.806 --> 12:05.974
Really? Have you seen a man
eat his own head?

12:06.101 --> 12:08.769
- No.
- So then you haven't seen everything.

12:08.895 --> 12:10.813
And neither have we.

12:11.064 --> 12:13.273
Last week in Paris,
we caught four terrorists

12:13.358 --> 12:15.234
with a weapon of mass destruction.

12:15.819 --> 12:19.530
The terrorists are planning
something very big.

12:19.656 --> 12:21.949
And just what does this have
to do with me?

12:22.242 --> 12:24.952
Our only hope is to have somebody
act like a terrorist

12:25.036 --> 12:27.329
who wants to help them
carry out the attack.

12:27.831 --> 12:31.500
An actor convincing enough to make
the terrorists think he's one of them.

12:32.710 --> 12:35.003
This is crazy. I'm an actor, not a spy.

12:35.588 --> 12:39.299
That's all spying is, acting.
And they say you're the best.

12:39.384 --> 12:42.553
An actor with a double major
in theatre and world languages?

12:42.637 --> 12:44.972
Hell, you're the perfect weapon, Gary.

12:47.475 --> 12:48.517
Look out!

13:19.090 --> 13:22.176
Right this way, you maverick renegade.

13:34.439 --> 13:36.732
Welcome to Team Base.

13:37.567 --> 13:41.528
Gary, this is Joe, all-star quarterback
from the University of Nebraska.

13:42.071 --> 13:43.489
He's a natural-born leader.

13:43.615 --> 13:45.616
I've heard a lot about your acting,
Mr Johnston.

13:45.909 --> 13:47.659
Hope it's as good as they say it is.

13:48.077 --> 13:49.495
And this is Sarah,

13:49.579 --> 13:52.498
the top empath from Berkeley's
School for the Clairvoyant

13:52.582 --> 13:53.916
in San Francisco.

13:54.083 --> 13:58.253
I sense that you're slightly
confused right now.

13:59.255 --> 14:03.050
That's supposed to be Carson's
replacement, a fucking actor?

14:03.218 --> 14:05.928
Don't mind Chris.
He may be lacking courtesy,

14:06.012 --> 14:09.097
but he's the best martial-arts expert
Detroit has to offer.

14:09.224 --> 14:12.559
That's right, actor.
Just stay the fuck away from me.

14:13.645 --> 14:17.731
And finally, we have our
psychology expert. Where's Lisa?

14:18.358 --> 14:19.608
Right here.

14:27.784 --> 14:31.954
Gary, this is Lisa. She specializes
in how the terrorists think.

14:32.455 --> 14:36.083
Usually a case of malignant narcissism
brought on during childhood.

14:36.584 --> 14:39.086
We've been doing our best
to keep the world safe, Gary.

14:39.212 --> 14:42.297
But now somebody has supplied
the terrorists with WMDs.

14:42.382 --> 14:45.217
And intelligence tells us
they plan to use them.

14:45.301 --> 14:46.802
Isn't that right, I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E.?

14:47.929 --> 14:51.056
- That is affirmative.
- I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E.?

14:51.140 --> 14:53.892
The most sophisticated computer
in the world.

14:53.977 --> 14:57.229
I've intercepted communications
that several terrorist groups

14:57.313 --> 15:01.108
are being organized for one
massive worldwide attack.

15:01.192 --> 15:02.943
From what I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E.
has gathered,

15:03.027 --> 15:04.945
it would be 9/11 times 100.

15:06.990 --> 15:10.158
9/11 times 100? Jesus, that's...

15:10.243 --> 15:13.579
Yes, 91,100.

15:15.373 --> 15:18.875
Basically, all the worst parts
of the Bible.

15:19.043 --> 15:21.503
So now you see why we need you.

15:21.921 --> 15:25.841
We will disguise you as a terrorist and
take you deep into the Middle East.

15:26.009 --> 15:29.511
If your acting is successful, you'll be
able to get us the information we need

15:29.596 --> 15:31.847
to stop this whole thing
from happening.

15:31.931 --> 15:34.766
Of course, if you're not interested,

15:34.851 --> 15:35.892
there's the door.

15:39.439 --> 15:41.189
All right. Thanks.

15:52.410 --> 15:55.078
Gary. Hey, hold on a second.

15:55.538 --> 15:58.582
Don't you understand?
Every country in the world is in danger.

15:58.666 --> 16:01.293
How is it my responsibility
to do something?

16:01.878 --> 16:05.922
Because like it or not, you're the one
with the power to do something.

16:08.843 --> 16:12.554
I can't fight terrorists. I don't know
anything about guns or jets.

16:12.639 --> 16:15.766
That doesn't matter.
If you want to help people,

16:16.225 --> 16:20.354
all that matters, Gary,
is what you have here.

16:26.569 --> 16:29.946
Just think about it, okay?
Here, take this.

16:34.702 --> 16:38.288
Baxter will take you wherever
you wanna go. Just remember,

16:38.373 --> 16:41.291
your freedom's at stake, too.

16:53.429 --> 16:55.764
What do you think Spottswoode
sees in him?

16:55.848 --> 16:59.142
I don't know. But I think I see it, too.

17:16.285 --> 17:17.786
Hey, Baxter.

17:18.954 --> 17:21.123
I wanna take a detour.

17:22.458 --> 17:24.501
What would you do

17:24.585 --> 17:28.338
If you were asked to give up
your dreams for freedom?

17:29.966 --> 17:31.800
What would you do

17:31.968 --> 17:36.012
If asked to make
the ultimate sacrifice?

17:36.305 --> 17:39.516
Would you think about
all them people

17:39.642 --> 17:43.353
Who gave up everything they had?

17:43.479 --> 17:47.190
Would you think about
all them war vets

17:47.275 --> 17:51.486
And would you start to feel bad?

17:53.656 --> 17:56.324
Freedom isn't free

17:56.492 --> 18:00.162
It costs folks like you and me

18:00.329 --> 18:02.748
And if we don't all chip in

18:02.832 --> 18:07.461
We'll never pay that bill

18:08.796 --> 18:11.673
Freedom isn't free

18:11.799 --> 18:14.801
No, there's a hefty fucking fee

18:15.428 --> 18:21.892
And if you don't throw in
your buck-o-five, who will?

18:23.811 --> 18:25.729
Buck-o-five

18:26.022 --> 18:29.983
Freedom costs a buck-o-five

19:09.816 --> 19:12.818
Our dear leader, Kim Jong II, says
the weapons of mass destruction

19:12.944 --> 19:15.695
you requested are ready for you to take.

19:16.030 --> 19:17.656
I am still in the process of recruiting

19:17.740 --> 19:20.325
and training new terrorists
for the attack.

19:20.409 --> 19:22.994
We take weapons later.

19:30.503 --> 19:33.129
He asks what part of the deal
you did not understand.

19:33.214 --> 19:36.007
He says perhaps his translator
did not make it clear to you.

19:36.092 --> 19:39.594
He says he should fire his translator?

19:43.683 --> 19:46.810
Do you have any idea
how fucking busy I am?

19:46.936 --> 19:49.938
I cannot berieve that I actually have
a Chechnyan standing here

19:50.022 --> 19:51.857
terring me when
he's gonna take a derivery.

19:52.233 --> 19:53.275
Herro?

19:54.026 --> 19:56.403
Perhaps we can be ready sooner.

19:56.654 --> 19:58.780
Yes, perhaps you can.

19:59.156 --> 20:01.491
Now, take your weapons
of mass destruction

20:01.576 --> 20:03.493
and get the fuck out of here.

20:22.138 --> 20:24.764
I had to come back.

20:24.891 --> 20:27.976
- I know you did, son.
- I still say this is a fucking mistake.

20:28.144 --> 20:31.646
Stop it, Chris. I sense that you're
making him feel intimidated.

20:32.148 --> 20:33.648
Gary, I'm afraid there's no time.

20:33.774 --> 20:36.151
I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E. tells us
the attack is imminent.

20:36.319 --> 20:39.237
We need you to act like
a Middle Eastern terrorist right away.

20:39.614 --> 20:43.366
There's just one problem.
I don't look Middle Eastern.

20:45.161 --> 20:47.162
Leave that to us.

20:58.716 --> 21:02.385
Sarah's a professional at skin grafting
and laser valmoriphication.

21:03.638 --> 21:05.347
Just try to be still.

21:42.593 --> 21:44.135
Amazing.

21:44.303 --> 21:45.929
The valmoriphication
completely worked.

21:46.055 --> 21:48.056
Sit up and take a look, Gary.

21:54.814 --> 21:55.981
It's uncanny.

21:57.066 --> 21:59.734
You're going to fool everyone, Gary.

21:59.860 --> 22:00.902
Or should I say,

22:01.028 --> 22:02.696
Hakmed.

22:03.739 --> 22:06.282
All right, team, we've only got
one shot at this, so listen up.

22:07.493 --> 22:09.619
I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E.
has intercepted communications

22:09.745 --> 22:14.332
that terrorists from different countries
are gathering at a tavern here, in Cairo.

22:14.750 --> 22:17.460
Cairo. That's in Egypt.

22:17.920 --> 22:19.713
Exactly right, Joe.

22:19.797 --> 22:23.883
Now, team, your mission will be
to get Gary into that tavern.

22:23.968 --> 22:27.012
And once he's on the inside,
cover his back.

22:27.096 --> 22:29.014
Gary, you must use your acting

22:29.098 --> 22:32.058
to find out any information you can
from the terrorists.

22:34.061 --> 22:37.105
Gary, if for some reason
your cover is blown

22:37.189 --> 22:39.232
and the terrorists take you prisoner,

22:40.026 --> 22:42.861
well, you'll probably want
to take your own life.

22:42.945 --> 22:45.530
Here, you'd better have this.

22:51.287 --> 22:53.955
All right, team, that's it.
We've got a job to do.

22:54.290 --> 22:56.916
Let's go police the world.

22:57.918 --> 23:04.215
America

23:04.675 --> 23:07.427
- America
- Fuck, yeah

23:07.511 --> 23:10.096
Coming again to save
The motherfucking day, yeah

23:10.181 --> 23:13.141
- America
- Fuck, yeah

23:13.350 --> 23:16.144
Freedom is the only way, yeah

23:16.228 --> 23:18.730
Terrorists, your game is through

23:18.814 --> 23:21.691
'Cause now you have to answer to

23:21.776 --> 23:24.444
- America
- Fuck, yeah

23:24.528 --> 23:27.322
So lick my butt
And suck on my balls

23:27.406 --> 23:30.325
- America
- Fuck, yeah

23:32.495 --> 23:34.871
What if the old man is wrong
about him, huh?

23:35.206 --> 23:38.583
What if he's not the great actor
Spottswoode says he is?

23:39.668 --> 23:42.087
Why don't you trust actors, Chris?

23:44.131 --> 23:46.508
I got my reasons.

23:50.930 --> 23:52.514
You all right, Gary?

23:53.390 --> 23:55.183
I was just thinking.

23:55.351 --> 23:58.603
Onstage, if I mess up a line,
it could mean a bad review.

23:58.896 --> 24:00.939
If I mess up here,

24:01.065 --> 24:02.982
we're all dead.

24:04.110 --> 24:06.861
I believe you can do this, Gary.

24:07.154 --> 24:10.406
Why? What reason do you
have to believe?

24:11.826 --> 24:16.037
Sometimes believing is all we have.

25:10.259 --> 25:13.219
Fear not, Muslim friends.
We're here to find terrorists.

25:13.345 --> 25:16.556
I'm clearing your minds of all anxiety.

25:17.391 --> 25:20.768
All right, good job, Sarah.
Now, everyone make for the tavern.

25:20.936 --> 25:23.521
Let's get one thing straight, actor.
I don't trust you.

25:23.647 --> 25:26.858
And if you betray us, I'll rip your fucking
balls off and stuff them up your ass

25:26.942 --> 25:30.153
so that the next time you shit,
you'll shit all over your balls, got it?

25:30.279 --> 25:32.822
- What's your problem with me?
- Yeah, you wanna go?

25:32.907 --> 25:34.324
Guys, guys, guys!

25:34.408 --> 25:36.993
Don't you see this is just
what the terrorists want us to do?

25:37.077 --> 25:41.456
The war is out there, man. Out there.
Now, pull it together.

25:43.042 --> 25:46.252
All right, team, let's move
to the inner city. Keep it quiet.

25:58.474 --> 26:00.725
- Clear.
- Clear.

26:00.809 --> 26:02.560
All right, Gary, you follow me.
The rest of the team,

26:02.645 --> 26:04.812
take super-secret hiding positions
Alpha One.

26:07.983 --> 26:10.443
All right, that's the tavern
with the blue door.

26:10.903 --> 26:14.822
Act your way past those guards
and see what you can find out.

26:15.115 --> 26:17.992
Remember, if you think they're
onto you, give us the signal.

26:18.077 --> 26:19.827
You remember the signal?

26:21.830 --> 26:25.166
That's right. All right, good luck.

26:27.753 --> 26:29.420
Go get them, cowboy.

27:01.078 --> 27:02.537
Oh, shit.

27:02.705 --> 27:05.331
Come on, Gary, act.
You have the power.

27:24.143 --> 27:26.644
- All right, Gary!
- Told you he was top-gun.

27:26.812 --> 27:30.773
- I've never seen acting that good.
- He's amazing.

27:48.542 --> 27:51.252
Yeah, no, I know. It's terrible, terrible.

27:53.005 --> 27:56.758
We are Bashir rebels from
the country of Somalia. Who are you?

27:58.594 --> 28:02.263
My name is Hakmed. I'm a terrorist.

28:05.100 --> 28:08.936
Anybody know of any terrorist attacks
coming up soon?

28:22.117 --> 28:25.203
I sense that I'm becoming
attracted to Gary.

28:26.789 --> 28:29.290
My advice is not to get involved
with a team member, Sarah.

28:29.375 --> 28:32.460
It's too painful to see them die.

28:33.295 --> 28:35.630
I'm sorry, Lisa.
I didn't mean to bring up...

28:35.756 --> 28:38.800
It's okay, Sarah.
I treasure your friendship.

28:39.468 --> 28:41.803
I treasure yours, Lisa.

28:48.143 --> 28:51.979
Hey, have you ever thought
of telling Sarah how you feel?

28:53.107 --> 28:57.360
What would a girl like Sarah want
with a simple Nebraska boy like me?

28:57.444 --> 29:00.655
I don't know nothing about fancy cars
and fancy restaurants.

29:01.573 --> 29:05.493
Still, I'd love to show her
a full-moon night on the cornfields.

29:20.050 --> 29:21.759
What do you know?

29:22.511 --> 29:25.721
I heard there might be
a large terrorist attack.

29:25.848 --> 29:29.517
If you tell me what it is,
maybe I could help out.

29:29.685 --> 29:32.979
Get out of here. We have put out
a jihad on the infidels

29:33.147 --> 29:35.690
because they destroyed our lives.

29:36.400 --> 29:39.235
What do you know
about pain and sadness?

29:41.864 --> 29:44.699
Gary. Help me! Help me!

29:44.867 --> 29:48.369
Get him off!
Get this thing off of me! Gary!

29:50.497 --> 29:53.374
I was just a boy when the infidels
came to my village

29:53.459 --> 29:55.209
in their BLACK HAWK helicopters.

29:57.129 --> 30:01.591
The infidels fired at the oil fields
and they lit up like the eyes of Allah.

30:01.675 --> 30:05.511
Burning oil rained down from the sky
and cooked everything it touched.

30:05.596 --> 30:08.431
I could only hide myself and cry
as my goats were consumed

30:08.515 --> 30:10.391
by the fiery, black liquid death.

30:13.729 --> 30:15.396
In the midst of the chaos,

30:15.689 --> 30:19.942
I could swear that I heard my goats
screaming for help.

30:21.904 --> 30:25.323
As quickly as they had come,
the infidels were gone.

30:25.616 --> 30:29.911
It was on that day I put a jihad on them.

30:32.831 --> 30:36.959
And if you don't believe it,
then you better kill me now,

30:37.085 --> 30:40.421
because I'll put a jihad on you, too.

30:46.136 --> 30:49.055
I like you. You have balls.

30:49.515 --> 30:51.390
I like balls.

30:53.977 --> 30:56.771
All right, listen carefully.
The WMDs are located

30:56.855 --> 30:59.690
in a secret bunker 20 yards east
of this building.

30:59.775 --> 31:02.318
You can help us by guarding it
and making...

31:06.698 --> 31:08.241
Come. They're onto us!

31:08.659 --> 31:10.284
Hurry, friend.
We must make our escape.

31:14.623 --> 31:18.251
Shit. I've got five terrorists going
southeast on Baka laka daka Street.

31:18.585 --> 31:19.544
Don't let them get away.

31:25.676 --> 31:27.843
I sense Gary's trapped
inside the tavern.

31:28.178 --> 31:30.596
Copy, Sarah. You get Gary,
we'll go after the terrorists.

31:31.598 --> 31:34.642
America

31:35.102 --> 31:38.020
- America
- Fuck, yeah

31:38.105 --> 31:40.898
Coming again to save
The motherfucking day, yeah

31:40.983 --> 31:43.693
- America
- Fuck, yeah

31:43.777 --> 31:46.737
Freedom is the only way, yeah

31:47.656 --> 31:50.533
It's the dream that we all share

31:50.617 --> 31:53.494
It's the hope for tomorrow

31:53.662 --> 31:55.121
Go faster, you idiot.

32:01.169 --> 32:03.462
Die! Infidels!

32:10.679 --> 32:13.264
- They're not stopping.
- They had their chance.

32:22.357 --> 32:23.733
Missed. Wide right.

32:26.278 --> 32:28.362
One of the terrorists is trying
to tell us something.

32:28.947 --> 32:30.573
It's me. It's me.

32:31.033 --> 32:34.368
Looks like he's saying,
"Kiss me. Kiss me."

32:34.536 --> 32:35.870
Smartass motherfucker.

32:50.761 --> 32:52.970
- Gary?
- An infidel.

32:53.055 --> 32:54.930
Kill her.

33:05.567 --> 33:06.567
Gary?

33:10.697 --> 33:13.824
- Sarah to Team America 4.
- What you got, Sarah?

33:13.909 --> 33:17.411
Gary isn't in the tavern.
I think he may be with...

33:17.496 --> 33:20.790
- Say again, Sarah. You're breaking up.
- Joe, do you copy?

33:21.458 --> 33:24.335
- I'll get him.
- Lisa?

33:28.215 --> 33:29.799
I lost her.

33:29.883 --> 33:33.010
It's all right. We'll kill these guys,
then we'll find out what she wants.

33:33.095 --> 33:34.095
Right.

33:41.895 --> 33:43.604
Hey, guys, I think we should pull over.

33:43.730 --> 33:45.648
Pull over? Yes, of course.

33:45.732 --> 33:48.317
Pull over, let them pass us, and when
they turn around, we charge them.

33:48.402 --> 33:50.027
I love your balls.

33:53.907 --> 33:55.199
Shit, they got by me.

33:59.663 --> 34:02.873
- What are we doing?
- This jeep is filled with explosives.

34:02.958 --> 34:05.334
We're going to take their lives
and our own.

34:05.419 --> 34:07.253
We're gonna what?

34:08.338 --> 34:10.339
- Hang on, Joe.
- Die, infidels.

34:22.310 --> 34:23.476
Surprise, cockfags!

34:41.663 --> 34:43.831
All right. We fucking did it.

34:47.668 --> 34:52.255
Spottswoode, it's Lisa. Gary found
the WMDs and the terrorists are down.

34:52.591 --> 34:56.510
Great job, team. Head back to base
for debriefing and cocktails.

35:00.515 --> 35:03.893
This is breaking news
with Peter Jennings.

35:04.686 --> 35:07.855
Team America has once again
pissed off the entire world

35:07.939 --> 35:09.899
after blowing up half of Cairo.

35:09.983 --> 35:13.235
And now some Hollywood celebrities
are lashing out.

35:13.320 --> 35:16.697
Alec Baldwin is head
of the Film Actors Guild.

35:17.032 --> 35:19.158
The Film Actors Guild believes

35:19.242 --> 35:21.952
that what the world needs
is compassion, not violence.

35:22.037 --> 35:25.706
All that Team America
does is create new enemies.

35:25.832 --> 35:28.375
Let me explain to you how this works.

35:28.460 --> 35:31.837
You see, the corporations
finance Team America.

35:31.922 --> 35:35.633
And then Team America goes out,
and the corporations sit there in their...

35:35.717 --> 35:40.054
In their corporation buildings,
and, see, they're all corporation-y,

35:40.138 --> 35:41.347
and they make money.

35:42.974 --> 35:44.558
Last year I went to Iraq.

35:44.684 --> 35:47.728
Before Team America showed up,
it was a happy place.

35:47.813 --> 35:50.481
They had flowery meadows
and rainbow skies

35:50.565 --> 35:52.608
and rivers made of chocolate,
where the children danced

35:52.692 --> 35:55.653
and laughed and played
with gumdrop smiles.

35:55.779 --> 35:57.822
The actors are calling
for an emergency meeting.

35:57.906 --> 35:59.990
Already expected to attend
are Helen Hunt,

36:00.075 --> 36:05.246
George Clooney, Liv Tyler,
Martin Sheen, Susan Sarandon,

36:05.330 --> 36:07.832
Janeane Garofalo and Matt Damon.

36:07.916 --> 36:10.334
Matt Damon.

36:11.169 --> 36:14.421
In the meantime, the world wants
to deal with dangerous individuals

36:14.506 --> 36:15.631
their own way.

36:34.109 --> 36:36.610
Hans Brix? Oh, no.

36:38.321 --> 36:41.323
Oh, herro,
great to see you again, Hans.

36:41.616 --> 36:45.452
Mr II, I was supposed to be allowed
to inspect your palace today,

36:45.537 --> 36:48.622
and your guards won't let me into
certain areas.

36:48.748 --> 36:52.042
Hans, Hans, Hans. We've been
through this a dozen times.

36:52.210 --> 36:56.130
I don't have any weapons
of mass destruction, okay, Hans?

36:56.214 --> 36:59.466
Then let me look around
so I can ease the UN's collective mind.

36:59.593 --> 37:03.220
Hans, you're breaking my barrs here.
Hans, you're breaking my barrs.

37:03.305 --> 37:06.098
I'm sorry, but the UN must be
firm with you.

37:06.182 --> 37:09.518
Let me see your whole palace, or else.

37:09.603 --> 37:11.145
Or else what?

37:11.897 --> 37:15.900
Or else we will be very,
very angry with you.

37:15.984 --> 37:19.445
And we will write you a letter
telling you how angry we are.

37:21.031 --> 37:23.991
Okay, I'll show you, Hans. You ready?

37:24.117 --> 37:25.576
Stand a rittle to your reft.

37:28.246 --> 37:29.330
A rittle more.

37:30.916 --> 37:32.207
Good.

37:38.131 --> 37:39.423
There you go, Hans Brix.

37:39.507 --> 37:41.842
How you rike that,
you fucking cocksucker?

37:44.763 --> 37:48.307
Do you have any idea
how fucking busy I am, Hans Brix?

37:48.391 --> 37:50.726
Well, fuck you. You want inspection?

37:50.810 --> 37:54.188
Well, inspect that,
you buttfucking piece of shit.

37:55.190 --> 37:57.650
What, you think I'm just
a petty arms dearer?

37:57.734 --> 37:59.443
I'm pranning the attack.

37:59.527 --> 38:03.948
Congraturations, Team America,
you have stopped nothing.

38:23.218 --> 38:26.220
Congratulations, Gary.
You've done an amazing thing.

38:26.388 --> 38:30.224
It will be years before the terrorists
have the resources to attack again.

38:30.892 --> 38:33.268
We're gonna be unstoppable
with you on the team, Gary.

38:33.395 --> 38:35.813
Terrorists, your game is through.

38:36.272 --> 38:38.148
You're the best, Gary.

38:39.901 --> 38:43.112
So this terrorist is shooting at us
from the back of his jeep, and he...

38:43.405 --> 38:45.656
You might have all the others fooled,
but not me.

38:45.740 --> 38:48.325
Your acting was reckless
and it put us all in danger.

38:48.576 --> 38:51.495
The next time you pull a stunt like that,
I'll drill two holes through your dick

38:51.579 --> 38:55.624
so that when you pee, it shoots out
in all different directions. You got it?

38:58.086 --> 38:59.920
Hey, Sarah, do you mind
if I dance with you?

39:00.005 --> 39:01.922
No, of course not, Joe.

39:11.683 --> 39:14.643
Joe, do you think it's okay
for team members to date?

39:16.271 --> 39:17.855
Sarah, really?

39:18.773 --> 39:20.607
Yeah. Do you think it's all right?

39:20.692 --> 39:23.027
I think it's better than all right. It's great!

39:23.153 --> 39:25.279
Oh, good. I'm so glad you think so.

39:39.711 --> 39:41.253
Gary? You okay?

39:43.006 --> 39:47.176
I was just wondering if I can let go
of an old, painful memory.

39:48.553 --> 39:50.763
Is it anything that you wanna talk about?

39:51.723 --> 39:55.225
When I was a kid, I always looked up
to my older brother, Tommy.

39:55.935 --> 39:58.645
He was the jock,
and I was the little performer.

39:59.981 --> 40:02.483
We were all out at the zoo one day.

40:02.567 --> 40:06.945
I was doing some acting, walking
on the railing of the gorilla exhibit.

40:07.030 --> 40:08.363
I fell in.

40:08.990 --> 40:12.409
Everyone screamed,
and Tommy jumped in after me,

40:12.494 --> 40:14.953
forgetting that he had blueberries
in his front pocket.

40:16.956 --> 40:18.499
The gorillas just went wild.

40:19.417 --> 40:22.377
They jumped all over his body
and threw him around like a rag doll

40:22.462 --> 40:24.338
to get to those blueberries.

40:26.716 --> 40:30.844
One gorilla would throw him to another
gorilla, who tossed him to another.

40:31.346 --> 40:34.056
Everyone panicked and cried out
for somebody to help,

40:34.140 --> 40:35.891
but it was too late.

40:36.101 --> 40:40.020
The gorillas beat him to death before
the zookeepers could gas them all.

40:44.275 --> 40:46.276
My acting

40:46.361 --> 40:48.070
got my brother killed.

40:48.154 --> 40:50.030
I've had to live with that

40:50.115 --> 40:51.740
every single day.

40:52.700 --> 40:55.661
Gary, you can't blame yourself
for what gorillas did.

40:56.996 --> 40:59.331
I think I can finally let it go.

40:59.666 --> 41:02.417
Because my acting
saved the entire world.

41:03.336 --> 41:05.212
And something even better happened.

41:05.380 --> 41:06.463
What?

41:07.006 --> 41:11.051
I met somebody
who took my breath away.

41:16.391 --> 41:17.641
Gary, no.

41:19.144 --> 41:20.227
I'm sorry.

41:20.311 --> 41:23.438
It's just...
Things are really complicated, Gary.

41:24.482 --> 41:26.233
I know about Carson.

41:26.693 --> 41:28.443
I know how it feels.

41:29.362 --> 41:31.155
God, I'm so confused.

41:31.447 --> 41:34.283
It's too soon to be
having feelings for you.

41:35.285 --> 41:39.413
Maybe feelings are feelings
because we can't control them.

41:40.415 --> 41:42.040
But I have to control them

41:42.125 --> 41:44.793
because I can't go through losing
somebody again. It's too painful.

41:45.253 --> 41:47.296
So... So, what, you're just
gonna shut down?

41:47.964 --> 41:49.631
I really like you.

41:49.924 --> 41:52.092
There's no chance
we can ever be together?

41:54.429 --> 41:56.597
Only if you could promise me
you'll never die.

41:58.308 --> 42:00.434
You know I can't promise that.

42:00.518 --> 42:03.645
If you did that,
I would make love to you right now.

42:08.443 --> 42:12.112
I promise. I will never die.

42:31.049 --> 42:34.509
I need this, I need love
I need you

42:37.639 --> 42:42.226
I don't need one heartbeat
I need two

42:44.020 --> 42:46.897
There's an emptiness I need to fill

42:47.523 --> 42:50.984
And only one emptiness will do

42:51.736 --> 42:57.074
Only a woman
Can brighten up my day

42:58.868 --> 43:05.123
Only a woman
Can touch me the right way, yeah

43:05.750 --> 43:10.671
Only a woman
Is allowed to touch me there

43:12.548 --> 43:16.760
All I ask
Is that you're a woman

43:16.844 --> 43:20.013
Lisa, you're the most amazing person
I've ever met.

43:20.515 --> 43:24.184
It's only been a short time,
but I think that I'm completely in love...

43:25.186 --> 43:26.728
Let's not talk.

43:27.689 --> 43:30.440
I can't help it. This just feels so right,

43:30.525 --> 43:32.317
and I don't want anything to mess it up.

43:35.113 --> 43:38.490
There's not a thing in the world
that can mess this up.

45:27.642 --> 45:30.143
Team, I'm afraid I have bad news.

45:30.645 --> 45:34.481
At 7:15 this morning,
the terrorists carried out their attack.

45:36.609 --> 45:38.985
- What?
- But how can that be?

45:39.153 --> 45:41.238
Gary stopped the terrorists in Cairo.

45:41.364 --> 45:43.115
It appears now that
I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E. was wrong

45:43.199 --> 45:44.991
about the Chechnyans being in charge.

45:46.160 --> 45:47.661
That was bad, I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E.

45:48.162 --> 45:50.831
- Very bad I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E.
- I'm sorry.

45:51.833 --> 45:55.335
We have to find out who did this
and take them down. Fast.

45:56.671 --> 46:00.340
Sir, I am intercepting communications
about the terrorists' identities.

46:00.675 --> 46:02.175
On screen.

46:02.301 --> 46:05.512
This is breaking news
with Peter Jennings.

46:06.556 --> 46:09.599
An attack in Panama today
has left thousands dead.

46:09.684 --> 46:12.561
Taking credit were terrorists
from Derka Derkastan.

46:13.604 --> 46:15.689
Of course, Derka Derkastan.

46:16.065 --> 46:18.942
The terrorists claim that the attack
was a retaliation

46:19.026 --> 46:20.986
for Team America's actions in Cairo.

46:21.070 --> 46:24.990
Alec Baldwin is rallying all
the members of the Film Actors Guild.

46:25.199 --> 46:27.451
- Alec Baldwin?
- Gary?

46:27.618 --> 46:29.077
He's my hero.

46:29.704 --> 46:31.705
The single greatest actor of all time.

46:32.373 --> 46:35.041
Who is to blame for these attacks
in Panama?

46:35.710 --> 46:37.002
The terrorists?

46:37.086 --> 46:39.212
The person who supplied them
with WMDs?

46:39.755 --> 46:42.716
No. Blame Team America.

46:44.469 --> 46:47.929
Their reckless disregard in Cairo
brought on this violence today.

46:48.764 --> 46:54.311
Team America, the blood of the victims
of Panama is on your hands.

46:56.939 --> 46:58.732
Moved by Baldwin's
impassioned speech,

46:59.066 --> 47:02.402
hundreds of people turned out
at Mount Rushmore today to protest.

47:06.324 --> 47:07.949
Hey, that's here.

47:08.743 --> 47:10.994
Tom, it looks like filmmaker
Michael Moore

47:11.078 --> 47:14.664
is also jumping on the
"Fuck Team America" bandwagon.

47:15.917 --> 47:17.584
Protesting is not enough.

47:17.668 --> 47:21.671
We must take radical action against
the fascists in our own country.

47:22.048 --> 47:24.424
Bring it down! Bring it all down!

47:30.932 --> 47:34.017
Team, if the Derka Derkastanis
have weapons of mass destruction,

47:34.101 --> 47:38.063
I'm afraid it could be 9/11 times 1,000.

47:38.147 --> 47:40.106
- Jesus, you mean...
- Yes.

47:40.525 --> 47:42.943
Nine hundred and eleven thousand.

47:43.861 --> 47:46.154
Then forget all these assholes.
We got work to do.

47:46.697 --> 47:49.491
Yes, let's get Gary valmorphanized
so he can use his acting.

47:49.575 --> 47:50.909
My acting?

47:51.118 --> 47:55.205
My acting? My acting just got
a thousand people killed.

47:55.289 --> 47:56.748
Jesus, I've done it again.

47:56.832 --> 47:59.960
Pull yourself together, Gary.
We need you now more than ever.

48:00.044 --> 48:02.629
- I'm through with this.
- Gary, you can't go.

48:02.713 --> 48:04.297
Without you, the team is doomed.

48:04.382 --> 48:07.634
Remember, there is no "I"
in Team America.

48:07.969 --> 48:09.469
Yes, there is.

48:12.807 --> 48:14.391
I know it's hard, Gary.

48:14.475 --> 48:17.477
But you're still the only hope
to stop these newer terrorists.

48:17.562 --> 48:19.813
Why me? Why am I the only one?

48:21.357 --> 48:22.524
Because you're the one
with the power to...

48:22.608 --> 48:24.401
Well, I don't want the fucking power!

48:27.154 --> 48:29.030
I don't want the guilt,
I don't want the shame

48:29.115 --> 48:30.865
and I don't want the responsibility.

48:31.784 --> 48:34.619
Then what about all the things
you promised last night?

48:34.704 --> 48:36.830
You said you'd never leave.

48:37.331 --> 48:41.376
I said I'd never die.
But now I'm dead inside.

48:43.129 --> 48:44.879
You slept with Gary?

48:47.341 --> 48:50.093
- Sarah.
- But you knew I liked Gary.

48:50.177 --> 48:51.553
I told you.

48:52.513 --> 48:54.180
You like Gary?

48:55.433 --> 48:56.850
Oh, I see.

48:58.019 --> 49:00.729
- I didn't plan on it happening, Sarah.
- Save it, Lisa.

49:03.024 --> 49:05.692
You see? All I do is hurt people.

49:06.611 --> 49:09.821
Gary, you didn't kill your brother.
Those gorillas did.

49:14.201 --> 49:16.202
I'm sorry I'm not the man you think I am.

49:17.079 --> 49:18.747
I'm just bad news.

49:20.499 --> 49:22.292
I'll never act again.

49:30.217 --> 49:32.218
Fuck him. We don't need an actor.

49:32.303 --> 49:35.055
We can take out the Derka
Derkastanis the old-fashioned way.

49:35.681 --> 49:37.932
No. It would be a suicide mission.

49:38.017 --> 49:41.227
That's all right.
I feel a little bit like dying.

49:44.649 --> 49:46.274
God damn it, Gary.

49:52.740 --> 49:57.327
- America
- Fuck, yeah

49:58.371 --> 50:03.958
Coming again to save
The motherfucking day, yeah

50:04.293 --> 50:09.172
- America
- Fuck, yeah

50:09.507 --> 50:15.303
Freedom is the only way
Yeah

50:15.721 --> 50:20.725
Terrorists, your game is through

50:20.851 --> 50:26.022
'Cause now you have to answer to

50:26.440 --> 50:31.611
- America
- Fuck, yeah

50:32.405 --> 50:37.325
America
Fuck

50:37.702 --> 50:40.745
Gary! Help me!
Get this thing off of me! Gary!

50:44.333 --> 50:47.544
All right, team.
We're nearing Derka Derkastan.

50:48.504 --> 50:49.629
Let's get ready.

50:51.298 --> 50:54.092
Look out! We've got terrorist aircraft.

50:59.515 --> 51:01.725
There's only five of them, team.
This should be easy.

51:01.809 --> 51:03.435
I've got Korean aircraft at one o'clock.

51:05.521 --> 51:07.522
What are they doing here?

51:12.027 --> 51:14.195
Shoot them down. Rike dogs.

51:14.530 --> 51:16.990
Kim Jong II?
Why is he helping terrorists?

51:25.374 --> 51:26.666
I've got one on my tail!

51:28.544 --> 51:30.336
I got you, Sarah.

51:34.800 --> 51:36.801
Bring in the submarines.

51:39.513 --> 51:42.932
What the hell? Something's shooting
at us from the water.

51:43.350 --> 51:46.311
- It must be a Korean sub.
- Chris, you've gotta take them out.

51:46.395 --> 51:48.062
I'm already on it.

51:54.820 --> 51:56.529
These guys really snuck up on us.

51:56.614 --> 51:58.990
Yeah, there's a lot of that
going around lately.

51:59.366 --> 52:01.576
Sarah, you know I didn't mean
to hurt you.

52:01.660 --> 52:04.037
No, you just didn't care if you did.

52:05.581 --> 52:07.373
Now, come on, Sarah, that isn't fair.

52:07.792 --> 52:10.335
Lisa can't help it
if Gary has feelings for her.

52:10.419 --> 52:14.214
Just like nobody can help it
if you have feelings for Gary.

52:18.719 --> 52:20.136
What is that supposed to mean?

52:20.221 --> 52:22.055
Oh, come on, Sarah.
You mean you never realized

52:22.139 --> 52:24.432
Joe has feelings for you?

52:27.394 --> 52:30.021
Joe? But you're like a brother to me.

52:31.482 --> 52:34.442
That's all I ever am. Like a brother.
It isn't fair.

52:41.075 --> 52:43.743
Hang on, team.
Someone has broken into the hangar.

52:43.828 --> 52:46.579
- Baxter?
- Hey, Team America.

52:46.747 --> 52:48.748
I got something for you.

52:48.916 --> 52:51.835
- What the hell?
- Prepare to die.

52:55.256 --> 52:57.841
Jesus titty-fucking...

53:01.220 --> 53:02.762
...Christ!

53:03.597 --> 53:04.764
Spottswoode!

53:07.476 --> 53:08.518
Oh, my God!

53:09.854 --> 53:12.397
No. He can't be dead.

53:13.774 --> 53:15.525
We've lost I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E.

53:15.609 --> 53:18.361
I repeat,
we have no I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E.

53:18.445 --> 53:21.114
Their computers are down. Attack!

53:25.661 --> 53:28.413
- Sarah!
- I sense I'm going down.

53:30.833 --> 53:32.834
Sarah! God, Chris, you gotta help her.

53:32.918 --> 53:35.378
I'm on it. Just hang on, Sarah.

53:38.007 --> 53:40.133
Oh, fuck, I've been hit.

53:40.342 --> 53:42.010
Chris, come in.

53:42.970 --> 53:44.888
- Oh, Jesus, I'm hit!
- Lisa!

53:44.972 --> 53:46.222
- Going down.
- God damn it,

53:46.307 --> 53:48.349
I'm gonna have to breach.

53:51.395 --> 53:53.313
I'm gonna hit the water.

53:54.648 --> 53:56.399
Missile lock. I've got missile lock.

53:56.483 --> 53:58.276
I've gotta bail out.

54:15.336 --> 54:19.756
Salvage their ships. If you find anyone
arive, you know what to do with them.

54:22.718 --> 54:24.510
Terrorists on screen.

54:25.679 --> 54:28.806
Okay, who brew up Panama Canal?

54:29.892 --> 54:31.935
We were angry about Cairo.

54:32.186 --> 54:34.228
God damn it, how many times
do I have to tell you?

54:34.313 --> 54:37.273
You don't use the WMDs
until you see the signal.

54:37.358 --> 54:39.275
I have worked ten years on this pran.

54:39.401 --> 54:42.195
It is a very precise
and a compricated pran.

54:42.321 --> 54:44.364
I am sick of you terrorists fucking it up.

54:44.448 --> 54:46.366
Now, take the weapons where I told you

54:46.450 --> 54:49.827
and wait for the goddamn signal
this time. Goodbye.

54:51.747 --> 54:54.207
Why is everyone so fucking stupid?

54:55.793 --> 54:58.294
Why aren't more people interrigent?
Rike me?

55:01.632 --> 55:05.802
I'm so ronery

55:05.886 --> 55:07.136
So ronery

55:07.972 --> 55:11.391
So ronery and sadry arone

55:11.850 --> 55:16.270
There's no one

55:16.563 --> 55:20.483
Sitting on my rittle throne

55:20.567 --> 55:24.570
I work rearry hard
And make up great prans

55:24.655 --> 55:28.908
But nobody ristens
No one understands

55:29.076 --> 55:35.123
Seems rike no one
Takes me seriousry

55:35.749 --> 55:36.916
And so

55:37.376 --> 55:39.252
I'm ronery

55:41.255 --> 55:43.631
A rittle ronery

55:43.716 --> 55:47.760

There's nobody I can rerate to

55:58.272 --> 56:02.025

56:02.109 --> 56:05.903
It's kind of sirry

56:05.988 --> 56:09.782
Because it's firring my body
With rage

56:09.867 --> 56:14.662
I'm the smartest, most crever
Most physicarry fit

56:14.747 --> 56:18.833
But nobody else seems to rearise it

56:18.917 --> 56:25.131
When I change the world
Maybe they'll notice me

56:25.466 --> 56:26.883
And until then

56:26.967 --> 56:29.594
I'll just be ronery

56:30.763 --> 56:33.306

Poor rittle me

56:42.900 --> 56:48.863
I'm so ronery

57:05.839 --> 57:07.465
What would you do

57:08.175 --> 57:11.219
If you were asked to give up
Your dreams for freedom?

57:13.347 --> 57:16.682
What would you do if asked
To make the ultimate sacrifice?

57:16.809 --> 57:19.602
Hey, weren't you the actor
in that Broadway show?

57:20.020 --> 57:23.481
Hey, yeah, it is you. Do that scene
where everyone gets AIDS.

57:24.525 --> 57:27.401
I don't act any more. I gave that up.

57:28.403 --> 57:31.948
- Oh, come on, man, just a scene.
- I said, get away from me!

57:32.032 --> 57:35.785
I'm completely lost. I've hit rock bottom.

57:35.869 --> 57:38.955
Easy, easy.
You gotta calm down there, Chuck.

57:39.039 --> 57:41.207
I hurt people. I'm a dick.

57:42.209 --> 57:44.544
Well, being a dick ain't so bad.

57:44.878 --> 57:46.712
See, there are three kinds of people,

57:46.797 --> 57:48.923
dicks, pussies and assholes.

57:49.550 --> 57:53.136
Pussies think everyone can get along
and dicks just wanna fuck all the time

57:53.220 --> 57:54.804
without thinking it through.

57:54.888 --> 57:57.181
But then you got your assholes, Chuck.

57:57.391 --> 58:00.476
And all the assholes want
is to shit all over everything.

58:01.353 --> 58:04.772
So pussies may get mad at dicks
once in a while

58:04.857 --> 58:06.399
because pussies get fucked by dicks.

58:07.025 --> 58:10.528
But dicks also fuck assholes, Chuck.

58:10.612 --> 58:13.239
And if they didn't fuck the assholes,
you know what you'd get?

58:13.490 --> 58:17.118
You'd get your dick and your pussy
all covered in shit.

58:18.412 --> 58:21.372
All right, that does it.
Get out of here, you drunk lowlife.

58:28.755 --> 58:30.256
Get out of here, I said.

58:39.349 --> 58:40.600
Lisa!

58:41.602 --> 58:44.937
Lisa. Lisa, are you here?

58:47.316 --> 58:49.942
Get out of the street, you fucking bum!

58:55.282 --> 58:57.617
You gave up on life, didn't you?

01:00:21.326 --> 01:00:24.620
My fellow actors, we live in a dark time.

01:00:24.871 --> 01:00:27.164
The world is becoming more
and more violent

01:00:27.249 --> 01:00:29.292
and the idiots in charge
are making it worse.

01:00:29.710 --> 01:00:33.838
What the world needs is
an international advisory committee

01:00:33.922 --> 01:00:36.549
who truly understands global politics.

01:00:36.717 --> 01:00:38.217
Namely, us.

01:00:41.638 --> 01:00:44.140
The time has come for us
to start using our acting talents

01:00:44.224 --> 01:00:45.850
in a different way.

01:00:45.934 --> 01:00:49.478
Yes, we can use our powers
to change the world.

01:00:52.316 --> 01:00:55.735
We will persuade everyone
to drive hybrid cars and stop smoking.

01:00:55.986 --> 01:00:58.821
If we focus our acting on global politics,

01:00:58.905 --> 01:01:01.407
we can change everything and stuff.

01:01:04.494 --> 01:01:07.997
As actors, it is our responsibility
to read the newspapers

01:01:08.081 --> 01:01:12.043
and then say what we read
on television like it's our own opinion.

01:01:12.919 --> 01:01:14.295
Matt Damon.

01:01:15.088 --> 01:01:16.797
We've all done action films.

01:01:16.882 --> 01:01:19.592
If anyone tries to get in our way,
we'll show them just how tough

01:01:20.844 --> 01:01:22.636
us actors really are.

01:01:26.016 --> 01:01:27.767
I'm glad you all agree.

01:01:27.851 --> 01:01:31.812
Because I've just been contacted
by a very important political leader

01:01:31.897 --> 01:01:34.523
who is bringing all
the world leaders together

01:01:34.608 --> 01:01:37.485
for a massive
international peace conference.

01:01:37.569 --> 01:01:41.822
And he wants us to be
the keynote speakers.

01:01:44.451 --> 01:01:45.910
Matt Damon!

01:01:48.121 --> 01:01:50.331
Say hello to our new partner.

01:01:51.458 --> 01:01:52.666
Herro.

01:02:01.885 --> 01:02:04.053
Stop it! Stop it, you're killing him!

01:02:06.431 --> 01:02:08.516
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

01:02:08.642 --> 01:02:13.729
You're not in a position to kill anyone,
my red, white and brue friend.

01:02:14.481 --> 01:02:17.691
So you're the bastard
planning 9/11 times 1,000.

01:02:18.568 --> 01:02:20.778
No. You think so small.

01:02:21.405 --> 01:02:25.449
You see, I'm about to have
an eraborate peace ceremony.

01:02:25.534 --> 01:02:29.912
And while all the world's most
important people are distracted here,

01:02:29.996 --> 01:02:31.997
I will detonate the WMDs

01:02:32.290 --> 01:02:36.043
which I have given to terrorists
arr around the grobe.

01:02:37.504 --> 01:02:42.842
It will be 9/11 times 2,356.

01:02:44.136 --> 01:02:47.430
My God, that's...
I don't even know what that is.

01:02:48.598 --> 01:02:50.141
Nobody does.

01:02:50.684 --> 01:02:53.519
You heartless bastard.
Why would you do such a thing?

01:02:53.603 --> 01:02:55.771
Because then there will be barance.

01:02:55.856 --> 01:02:58.357
Every country will be
a Third World country.

01:02:58.692 --> 01:03:00.276
Just imagine it.

01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:04.280
All around the world, there will be
massive exprosions.

01:03:04.364 --> 01:03:05.656
With nobody to guide them,

01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:09.785
the people will break out into panic
and rioting all over the Earth.

01:03:09.870 --> 01:03:13.038
The true nature of humanity
is unreashed.

01:03:13.290 --> 01:03:16.250
Dog eats dog,
as everyone attacks everyone

01:03:16.334 --> 01:03:18.669
and fends only for themselves.

01:03:18.753 --> 01:03:20.838
Grobal stabirity unravels.

01:03:21.214 --> 01:03:26.218
By the time my show is over,
it will be far too rate.

01:03:33.143 --> 01:03:34.351
Your plan will fail.

01:03:34.436 --> 01:03:37.855
You'll never keep the world leaders
distracted here for nine hours.

01:03:38.023 --> 01:03:42.443
Oh, no? I've got Arec Barrwin.

01:03:43.445 --> 01:03:44.737
Dear God.

01:03:45.405 --> 01:03:50.242
You are the rast of a dying breed,
the frag-waving American.

01:03:50.911 --> 01:03:53.579
Well, your rittle dream
will soon be over.

01:03:55.248 --> 01:03:57.500
I must get back to pranning
the ceremony now.

01:03:58.126 --> 01:04:00.544
The film actors are on their way.

01:04:00.629 --> 01:04:03.255
Perhaps they'll stop in and say herro.

01:04:05.133 --> 01:04:09.762
Having so little faith in humanity
must make you a very lonely man.

01:04:17.896 --> 01:04:20.231
You shall have a front-row seat.

01:04:20.857 --> 01:04:22.650
Bring her upstairs.

01:04:22.817 --> 01:04:25.194
Leave her alone, you son of a bitch!

01:04:25.362 --> 01:04:28.280
Lisa, I treasure your friendship!

01:04:29.950 --> 01:04:32.034
Somebody has to stop this!

01:04:39.417 --> 01:04:44.421
I miss you more than Michael Bay
missed the mark

01:04:44.798 --> 01:04:47.508
When he made Pearl Harbor

01:04:47.634 --> 01:04:52.638
I miss you more than that movie
missed the point

01:04:52.973 --> 01:04:56.892
And that's an awful lot, girl
And now

01:04:57.102 --> 01:04:59.520
Now you've gone away

01:05:00.647 --> 01:05:03.482
And all I'm trying to say

01:05:03.817 --> 01:05:05.985
Is Pearl Harbor sucked

01:05:06.069 --> 01:05:09.154
And I miss you

01:05:12.701 --> 01:05:16.954
I need you like Ben Affleck
Needs acting school

01:05:17.581 --> 01:05:20.374
He was terrible in that film

01:05:20.709 --> 01:05:25.129
I need you like Cuba Gooding
Needed a bigger part

01:05:25.755 --> 01:05:29.592
He's way better than Ben Affleck
And now

01:05:29.843 --> 01:05:33.304
All I can think about is your smile

01:05:33.513 --> 01:05:36.056
And that shitty movie, too

01:05:36.641 --> 01:05:38.559
Pearl Harbor sucked

01:05:39.477 --> 01:05:42.396
And I miss you

01:05:45.275 --> 01:05:48.068
Pearl Harbor sucked

01:05:50.113 --> 01:05:54.283
Just a little bit more
Than I miss you

01:05:56.411 --> 01:05:58.871
Oh, my God. What the hell happened?

01:06:19.059 --> 01:06:21.352
Hello? Anybody?

01:06:24.064 --> 01:06:26.649
Greetings, Mr Johnston.

01:06:27.025 --> 01:06:29.026
I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E.,
what the hell happened?

01:06:29.152 --> 01:06:33.072
Our base was attacked by
a giant socialist weasel.

01:06:33.740 --> 01:06:35.491
But where's the team?

01:06:35.575 --> 01:06:39.662
They have been taken prisoner
by Kim Jong II in North Korea.

01:06:39.746 --> 01:06:42.665
I have intercepted communications
that he is planning

01:06:42.749 --> 01:06:45.668
the massive attack
during a peace ceremony.

01:06:46.211 --> 01:06:49.004
Don't move, protester,
or I'll blow your commie brains out.

01:06:49.464 --> 01:06:51.965
- Spottswoode.
- Johnston?

01:06:52.759 --> 01:06:54.343
What the hell are you doing here?

01:06:54.427 --> 01:06:55.552
Get away from I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E.

01:06:55.637 --> 01:06:57.930
I'm using it to blow up North Korea.

01:06:58.014 --> 01:06:59.973
No! The team is in North Korea.

01:07:00.058 --> 01:07:04.770
I know. And so are the triggers
to WMDs poised all around the globe.

01:07:05.063 --> 01:07:07.147
My only option now
is to blow up Kim Jong II

01:07:07.232 --> 01:07:09.274
and everything around him
before he can set them off.

01:07:10.110 --> 01:07:12.945
I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E., initiate
detonation sequence on the ships.

01:07:13.113 --> 01:07:14.697
You'll kill them all.

01:07:14.781 --> 01:07:16.699
It's what they would
want me to do, Gary.

01:07:17.033 --> 01:07:18.992
They would happily give their lives
for the good of the world,

01:07:19.077 --> 01:07:22.204
- something you don't understand!
- There has to be another way.

01:07:22.497 --> 01:07:24.748
There's nobody left to stop Kim Jong II.

01:07:26.084 --> 01:07:27.418
Let me go.

01:07:28.837 --> 01:07:31.296
You? You're a buttfucking quitter.

01:07:32.006 --> 01:07:34.675
You walked out, Gary. The team went
on a mission without you.

01:07:34.801 --> 01:07:36.677
And without an actor,
they were like pigs to the slaughter.

01:07:36.803 --> 01:07:39.471
I'm supposed to leave
the fate of the world in your hands?

01:07:39.556 --> 01:07:42.349
I know I walked out,
but I'd do anything to take it back.

01:07:42.434 --> 01:07:45.310
- Please, just let me help.
- You've done enough.

01:07:45.979 --> 01:07:48.480
Please, Spottswoode,
you have to believe in me.

01:07:51.234 --> 01:07:54.570
I want to believe in you, Gary,
I really do.

01:07:55.238 --> 01:07:57.489
But you've let me down before.

01:07:58.283 --> 01:08:00.492
Please, how can I make you trust me?

01:08:03.121 --> 01:08:05.664
I remember the first time we met.

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:08.751
You were a simple Broadway actor
afraid to get in my limo

01:08:08.835 --> 01:08:12.337
because you thought I wanted you
to perform oral sex on me.

01:08:12.422 --> 01:08:14.214
Do you remember that?

01:08:14.799 --> 01:08:15.883
Yeah.

01:08:16.718 --> 01:08:21.263
And now the tables are turned,
and I don't know if I can trust you.

01:08:23.683 --> 01:08:26.518
Just give me a chance.

01:08:30.231 --> 01:08:32.274
All right, I'll trust you.

01:08:33.359 --> 01:08:35.027
But only if you

01:08:35.444 --> 01:08:37.613
will perform oral sex on me.

01:08:39.823 --> 01:08:42.408
- What?
- Right here, right now.

01:08:45.455 --> 01:08:48.540
- You can't be serious.
- Oh, I am serious.

01:08:48.625 --> 01:08:51.752
Look, this is my serious face.

01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:56.631
- What will that prove?
- It will prove that you are truly ready

01:08:56.716 --> 01:08:58.133
to lay everything on the line.

01:08:58.218 --> 01:09:00.594
To throw away all your inhibitions
and give 100 %.

01:09:00.678 --> 01:09:03.263
We must go back to that first night
we met, that first issue of trust.

01:09:03.348 --> 01:09:06.140
- Don't you see?
- No. I thought you weren't gay.

01:09:06.225 --> 01:09:08.560
This isn't about sex, Gary,
it's about trust.

01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:12.481
It's the eye of the needle, Gary,
and we must both pass through it.

01:09:17.153 --> 01:09:18.904
Okay, let's do it.

01:09:21.658 --> 01:09:24.076
I'll make sure nobody's watching.

01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:25.953
Yeah, it looks clear.

01:09:26.371 --> 01:09:27.621
Okay, go.

01:09:29.624 --> 01:09:31.082
There must be another way.

01:09:32.126 --> 01:09:34.877
I guess you won't do everything
to take it all back, will you, Gary?

01:09:34.962 --> 01:09:37.296
No, no, no. Wait, wait, hold on.

01:09:37.674 --> 01:09:41.718
You're saying if I do that,
you'll let me help the team?

01:09:42.886 --> 01:09:45.264
I'll give you all the time I can.

01:09:48.350 --> 01:09:50.018
Okay, let's do it.

01:09:51.104 --> 01:09:52.437
Here we go.

01:09:53.231 --> 01:09:54.439
And go.

01:10:23.970 --> 01:10:25.804
You are dedicated.

01:10:26.514 --> 01:10:27.848
Now, let's go get cleaned up.

01:10:28.141 --> 01:10:30.642
If you're going to storm Kim Jong II's
palace single-handed,

01:10:30.727 --> 01:10:33.812
we have to make you
a complete soldier in very little time.

01:10:35.023 --> 01:10:36.815
How we gonna do that?

01:10:36.941 --> 01:10:40.193
I think I know just what we need.

01:10:44.741 --> 01:10:47.242
The hour's approaching
To give it your best

01:10:47.327 --> 01:10:49.953
And you've got to reach your prime

01:10:50.997 --> 01:10:53.790
That's when you need
to put yourself to the test

01:10:53.875 --> 01:10:56.168
And show us a passage of time

01:10:56.336 --> 01:10:59.796
- We're gonna need a montage
- Montage

01:10:59.881 --> 01:11:03.050
- It takes a montage
- Montage

01:11:03.134 --> 01:11:06.303
Show a lot of things
Happening at once

01:11:06.387 --> 01:11:09.473
Remind everyone
Of what's going on

01:11:09.557 --> 01:11:12.684
And with every shot
Show a little improvement

01:11:12.769 --> 01:11:15.270
To show it all would take too long

01:11:15.355 --> 01:11:18.440
- That's called a montage
- Montage

01:11:18.524 --> 01:11:22.444
- Girl, we want a montage
- Montage

01:11:22.528 --> 01:11:25.405
In anything, if you want to go

01:11:25.490 --> 01:11:28.325
From just a beginner to a pro

01:11:28.409 --> 01:11:31.203
- You need a montage
- Montage

01:11:31.287 --> 01:11:35.749
- Even Rocky had a montage
- Montage

01:11:35.833 --> 01:11:41.463
- Always fade out in a montage
- Montage

01:11:41.547 --> 01:11:44.883
If you fade out
It seems like more time has passed

01:11:44.968 --> 01:11:47.678
- In a montage
- Montage

01:11:58.356 --> 01:12:00.148
Radies and gentlemen.

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:04.403
The Film Actors Guild and Kim Jong II
are preased to welcome you

01:12:04.487 --> 01:12:09.157
to the International
World Peace Ceremony.

01:12:10.410 --> 01:12:13.161
The most important people
from every country

01:12:13.246 --> 01:12:17.666
are gathered here in soridarity
to cerebrate peace.

01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:20.627
There will be music, dancing
and, of course,

01:12:20.712 --> 01:12:23.338
the biggest stars in Horrywood.

01:12:23.423 --> 01:12:27.509
In the box to your reft is the
mastermind of this spectacurar show,

01:12:27.593 --> 01:12:30.762
the multitarented Kim Jong II.

01:12:32.098 --> 01:12:33.765
Oh, herro.

01:12:35.101 --> 01:12:40.063
And now we present to you
the very best in North Korean music.

01:12:59.167 --> 01:13:02.377
Ten years of pranning,
and finarry the night is here.

01:13:02.462 --> 01:13:06.840
The terrorists know to be in position by
the time Arec Barrwin takes the stage.

01:13:06.924 --> 01:13:10.927
That's when I trigger all the WMDs
to go off at the same time.

01:13:11.012 --> 01:13:13.055
When you see Arec Barrwin,

01:13:13.139 --> 01:13:16.933
you will see the true ugriness
of human nature.

01:13:17.518 --> 01:13:20.270
Your plan will never work.
Something will stop it.

01:13:21.856 --> 01:13:24.316
You stupid, naive Team Americans.

01:13:24.692 --> 01:13:26.568
You berieve in true rove
and happy endings

01:13:26.652 --> 01:13:29.488
even while the world around you
spirals downward.

01:13:30.907 --> 01:13:34.284
Sometimes believing is all we have.

01:13:37.163 --> 01:13:39.998
And as the leaders of your countries,
you have the power

01:13:40.083 --> 01:13:44.628
to bring the world together under
the principles of the Film Actors Guild.

01:13:45.755 --> 01:13:47.172
You're gonna knock them dead, Alec.

01:13:48.966 --> 01:13:51.009
Ten minutes, Mr Baldwin.

01:14:01.479 --> 01:14:03.271
Who the hell you?

01:14:03.356 --> 01:14:06.608
I'm with the Film Actors Guild.
I'm here to help with the broadcast.

01:14:06.692 --> 01:14:08.401
Then you show credentials.

01:14:08.486 --> 01:14:10.529
Hey, you don't need to see
my credentials.

01:14:10.613 --> 01:14:12.697
I left them at home and I'm running late.

01:14:13.699 --> 01:14:16.034
- I berieve him.
- Yeah, me, too.

01:14:16.369 --> 01:14:18.703
Okay, have a nice day.

01:14:18.788 --> 01:14:20.997
My God, his acting is better than ever.

01:14:37.265 --> 01:14:40.517
Don't worry, fellas,
I've got my pass right here.

01:14:50.570 --> 01:14:52.362
Please, Mr Sheen, Mr Robbins,

01:14:52.446 --> 01:14:54.406
you don't understand
what Kim Jong II is doing.

01:14:54.782 --> 01:14:58.577
Shut up. We have explicit instructions
to watch you.

01:14:58.744 --> 01:15:01.872
- Yeah. We're supposed to be guards.
- We're guards.

01:15:01.998 --> 01:15:05.167
- We're guards, huh? We're guards.
- We're guards.

01:15:05.251 --> 01:15:08.879
Mr Sheen, Mr Robbins. Someone
has broken into the main hall.

01:15:08.963 --> 01:15:10.964
What? Come on, Martin!

01:15:21.851 --> 01:15:24.686
- Gary?
- What the fuck are you doing here?

01:15:24.770 --> 01:15:26.730
Guys, are you all right? Where's Lisa?

01:15:27.690 --> 01:15:29.774
What the heck do you care?
You walked out on her.

01:15:30.026 --> 01:15:31.693
Look, I wanna make things right.

01:15:31.777 --> 01:15:33.695
Here, Spottswoode's monitoring
from the base.

01:15:33.779 --> 01:15:36.740
- Spottswoode is dead, Gary.
- Not as dead as you think.

01:15:36.824 --> 01:15:40.035
- Spottswoode!
- Yes, I'm here, Joe.

01:15:40.369 --> 01:15:43.538
- All right, you're alive!
- Great to hear your voices again.

01:15:43.623 --> 01:15:46.458
Now we've got to get Lisa
and stop Kim Jong II.

01:15:46.542 --> 01:15:48.752
I'm not going anywhere
with this fucking traitor.

01:15:48.836 --> 01:15:50.962
What makes you think
we'll take you back, douchebag?

01:15:51.130 --> 01:15:53.632
- We're doing this without you!
- Now, hold on, team.

01:15:53.799 --> 01:15:55.217
Gary has already proven to me

01:15:55.301 --> 01:15:57.761
that he is 100 % committed to the team.

01:15:57.845 --> 01:16:00.680
He proved it last night
by sucking my cock.

01:16:05.186 --> 01:16:07.646
All right. Come on, team,
we gotta find that stage.

01:16:08.564 --> 01:16:12.442
Rook how much they rove my show.
The entire audience is so captivated.

01:16:19.992 --> 01:16:23.203
And now you see,
the new world is inevitabre.

01:16:24.163 --> 01:16:27.457
- It's what?
- Inevitabre.

01:16:28.292 --> 01:16:30.085
- One more time.
- Inevitabre!

01:16:30.294 --> 01:16:32.254
Things are inevitabry going to change.

01:16:33.047 --> 01:16:35.298
God damn it, open your fucking ears.

01:16:37.843 --> 01:16:39.970
- Five minutes, Mr Baldwin.
- Thank you.

01:16:40.179 --> 01:16:44.182
- Alec, we have a problem.
- Team America escaped.

01:16:45.059 --> 01:16:47.936
What? You fools.
They'll ruin everything.

01:16:48.020 --> 01:16:49.980
We better warn everyone.
They'll be headed here.

01:16:50.773 --> 01:16:53.775
No. We can't look weak and powerless.

01:16:53.859 --> 01:16:57.279
If violence is all those bastards
understand, then violence they'll get.

01:16:57.363 --> 01:16:59.322
Every actor, grab a gun
and keep Team America

01:16:59.407 --> 01:17:01.574
from reaching this ceremony
at all costs.

01:17:06.831 --> 01:17:10.041
I swear they won't reach this stage.

01:17:27.810 --> 01:17:29.311
Jesus! What have we got?

01:17:29.395 --> 01:17:32.314
Looks like George Clooney
and Liv Tyler, 20 yards.

01:17:34.483 --> 01:17:36.526
Look out, it's Ethan Hawke
and Janeane Garofalo.

01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:44.367
Drop your weapons.

01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:46.077
Fucking die!

01:17:48.414 --> 01:17:49.539
We gotta split up.

01:17:49.623 --> 01:17:52.125
Sarah, you and Gary go that way.
Chris and I will go right.

01:17:52.418 --> 01:17:54.961
No, I think I'd rather team up
with you, Joe.

01:17:57.256 --> 01:17:59.591
I guess you're with me, cockfag.

01:18:01.594 --> 01:18:03.011
- Danny Glover!
- Come on, Penn.

01:18:03.095 --> 01:18:05.138
- We must protect the show.
- Right.

01:18:07.058 --> 01:18:09.642
- The stage must be that way.
- No. Joe, Sarah, it's a trap!

01:18:16.108 --> 01:18:17.859
Very impressive, warmongers.

01:18:17.943 --> 01:18:22.113
Now let's see how Kim Jong II's
panthers treat you.

01:18:25.117 --> 01:18:27.327
I went to Iraq, you know!

01:18:33.417 --> 01:18:36.044
- Susan Sarandon.
- Oh, thank God.

01:18:36.128 --> 01:18:38.630
We have to stop the ceremony.
Kim Jong II is mad.

01:18:38.714 --> 01:18:40.673
Here, let me loose.
I'll show you where the theatre is.

01:18:41.217 --> 01:18:43.885
- All right.
- No, Chris, stay away from her.

01:18:43.969 --> 01:18:48.306
- Fuck you. She wants to help us.
- No, Chris, she's acting.

01:18:49.517 --> 01:18:51.226
I am not. The others tied me up

01:18:51.310 --> 01:18:53.395
because I wouldn't go along
with their plans.

01:18:53.521 --> 01:18:55.855
Your skills are fading with age,
Miss Sarandon.

01:18:57.817 --> 01:19:00.151
You shall die a peasant's death!

01:19:09.829 --> 01:19:11.913
Jesus titty-fucking Christ.

01:19:11.997 --> 01:19:13.623
I could've sworn
she was telling the truth.

01:19:13.874 --> 01:19:17.252
That's why they call it acting.
Come on, we gotta find Lisa.

01:19:18.170 --> 01:19:22.006
I was 19 years old when
the musical Cats came to our town.

01:19:22.133 --> 01:19:24.175
I couldn't wait to see it.

01:19:25.553 --> 01:19:27.762
After the show, I was asked
if I wanted to go meet

01:19:28.180 --> 01:19:31.850
some of the performers backstage.
Man, I was thrilled.

01:19:31.934 --> 01:19:35.687
But when I got back there,
they were drunk and out of control.

01:19:36.689 --> 01:19:39.983
Rumpus Cat and Macavity
kept feeling up my leg.

01:19:40.067 --> 01:19:43.027
I tried to leave, but Rumpleteazer
held me down and...

01:19:45.239 --> 01:19:47.866
I was raped by Mr Mistoffelees.

01:19:52.329 --> 01:19:54.747
That's why you don't trust actors.

01:19:58.377 --> 01:20:00.587
I'm sorry I've been so hard on you.

01:20:00.671 --> 01:20:02.881
If there's still a world left
when this is all over,

01:20:03.257 --> 01:20:05.383
I'd like to buy you a beer.

01:20:08.262 --> 01:20:09.929
Come on, let's go.
We're running out of time.

01:20:14.727 --> 01:20:18.563
Sarah, before we die, I want to
finally tell you that I love you.

01:20:20.065 --> 01:20:23.610
No. No, I'm not gonna let it end like this.

01:20:24.153 --> 01:20:27.864
We are not your enemy, furry ones.
You will not attack us.

01:20:28.324 --> 01:20:32.076
Sarah, that isn't going to work.
You don't really have mental powers.

01:20:32.244 --> 01:20:36.080
Your captors are behind you, Shebas.
Show your anger to them.

01:20:57.269 --> 01:20:59.103
Sarah, you did it!

01:21:02.733 --> 01:21:04.192
Wait. Hold on.

01:21:05.361 --> 01:21:07.362
Spottswoode, I think we just found
the entrance to the theatre.

01:21:07.446 --> 01:21:09.614
Have Sarah and Joe lock on to our...

01:21:10.658 --> 01:21:11.950
Gary!

01:21:12.993 --> 01:21:15.662
- Actors, ho!
- Helen Hunt.

01:21:15.746 --> 01:21:17.455
Samuel Jackson.

01:21:18.624 --> 01:21:19.958
Matt Damon.

01:21:22.002 --> 01:21:23.670
Motherfucker.

01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:26.673
Gary, Chris, come in.

01:21:28.968 --> 01:21:33.179
And now, radies and gentlemen,
Mr Arec Barrwin.

01:21:45.651 --> 01:21:48.736
We are here to usher in a new era
without violence.

01:21:48.821 --> 01:21:51.197
By following the rules
of the Film Actors Guild,

01:21:51.282 --> 01:21:53.616
the world can become a better place

01:21:53.701 --> 01:21:57.745
that handles dangerous people
with talk and reasoning.

01:21:57.830 --> 01:22:00.331
That is the F.A.G. way.

01:22:01.667 --> 01:22:06.004
One day you'll all look at the world
us actors created and say,

01:22:06.088 --> 01:22:09.591
"Wow. Good going, F.A.G.

01:22:09.675 --> 01:22:13.636
"You really made the world
a better place, didn't you, F.A.G.?"

01:22:13.721 --> 01:22:18.766
Yes, Arec Barrwin. Too bad
there won't be a world reft.

01:22:18.851 --> 01:22:20.268
Oh, God, no.

01:22:20.978 --> 01:22:25.857
You see? No Prince Charming rode in
on a white stallion to save the day.

01:22:26.191 --> 01:22:28.067
This is the real world.

01:22:28.694 --> 01:22:32.780
I'm afraid your world is over.

01:22:33.073 --> 01:22:34.365
In five minutes.

01:22:37.369 --> 01:22:39.287
Yes, the ticking crock.

01:22:42.249 --> 01:22:46.294
Sorry, Team America, but you see,
we must live in a time of peace.

01:22:46.837 --> 01:22:49.130
Put down the gas can now.

01:22:49.465 --> 01:22:50.798
Kill them.

01:22:55.638 --> 01:22:56.971
Jackson!

01:22:59.475 --> 01:23:01.309
Team, you've got to hurry.

01:23:07.399 --> 01:23:09.609
Let's go, bitch. I've done action films.

01:23:10.235 --> 01:23:11.694
Come on.

01:23:33.884 --> 01:23:35.426
Matt Damon!

01:23:46.146 --> 01:23:48.398
Come on, stop trying to hit me
and hit me.

01:23:55.698 --> 01:23:57.448
Don't fucking move!

01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:00.118
Now, isn't that a shame.

01:24:00.202 --> 01:24:02.286
You came so close to stopping peace.

01:24:02.371 --> 01:24:05.540
But you see, peace always finds a way.

01:24:05.624 --> 01:24:07.500
Goodbye, Team America.

01:24:07.835 --> 01:24:10.336
I've just got one piece of bad news
for you, Robbins.

01:24:10.754 --> 01:24:14.132
- What's that?
- I'm a smoker.

01:24:33.152 --> 01:24:35.278
Now that the world
is going to be run peacefully,

01:24:35.362 --> 01:24:36.988
we should all drive hybrid cars.

01:24:37.072 --> 01:24:39.449
Right now famiries
are gathering in parks,

01:24:39.533 --> 01:24:43.327
children are walking to school,
friends are sitting in movie theatres.

01:24:43.412 --> 01:24:47.915
All compretery unaware that the world
is about to change forever.

01:24:48.167 --> 01:24:49.834
All because of me.

01:24:52.588 --> 01:24:54.088
Stop that man.

01:24:56.175 --> 01:24:57.341
Gary!

01:24:57.468 --> 01:25:00.428
- Team America?
- God damn it.

01:25:00.512 --> 01:25:03.014
Sorry to interrupt the show,
everyone, but Kim Jong II

01:25:03.098 --> 01:25:05.308
is an international criminal.
We're here to arrest him.

01:25:05.517 --> 01:25:07.351
Oh, no, you're not.

01:25:07.603 --> 01:25:09.604
This is a peace conference.

01:25:09.688 --> 01:25:12.148
And if you even try to touch Kim Jong II,

01:25:12.316 --> 01:25:15.401
this audience and I will rise up
against you.

01:25:19.114 --> 01:25:20.114
Fuck off, Team America!

01:25:20.199 --> 01:25:22.784
Team, there's no time.
You have to convince that audience

01:25:22.868 --> 01:25:24.994
to let you do your job.

01:25:26.747 --> 01:25:31.417
- Gary, you've got to take the stage.
- No. I can't upstage Alec Baldwin.

01:25:31.502 --> 01:25:34.045
- He's the best actor in the world.
- You have to try.

01:25:34.379 --> 01:25:37.423
- I'm not that good.
- Actually...

01:25:37.883 --> 01:25:41.052
You're the finest actor I've ever met.

01:25:48.852 --> 01:25:51.103
Come on, Gary, hurry.
You've got to act fast.

01:25:55.234 --> 01:25:58.236
I know you all don't like Team America
a whole lot right now,

01:25:59.238 --> 01:26:01.572
but Kim Jong II is a lot worse.

01:26:04.576 --> 01:26:06.911
You can't out-act me, boy.
Don't even try.

01:26:08.247 --> 01:26:12.792
For the truth is that Team America
fights for the billion-dollar corporations.

01:26:13.252 --> 01:26:17.964
They are just as bad
as the enemies they fight.

01:26:21.510 --> 01:26:24.095
Oh, no, we aren't. We're dicks!

01:26:29.268 --> 01:26:31.435
We're reckless, arrogant, stupid dicks.

01:26:34.273 --> 01:26:37.441
And the Film Actors Guild are pussies.

01:26:39.945 --> 01:26:42.989
And Kim Jong II is an asshole.

01:26:45.701 --> 01:26:50.079
Pussies don't like dicks,
because pussies get fucked by dicks.

01:26:50.622 --> 01:26:54.125
But dicks also fuck assholes,

01:26:54.626 --> 01:26:57.461
assholes who just wanna shit
on everything.

01:26:58.505 --> 01:27:01.716
Pussies may think they can deal
with assholes their way.

01:27:01.884 --> 01:27:04.135
But the only thing
that can fuck an asshole

01:27:04.344 --> 01:27:07.305
is a dick with some balls.

01:27:10.809 --> 01:27:14.395
The problem with dicks
is that sometimes they fuck too much.

01:27:14.605 --> 01:27:18.941
- Or fuck when it isn't appropriate.
- Yes, Gary, yes.

01:27:19.526 --> 01:27:22.403
And it takes a pussy to show them that.

01:27:22.487 --> 01:27:24.488
But sometimes pussies
get so full of shit

01:27:24.615 --> 01:27:26.616
that they become assholes themselves.

01:27:27.868 --> 01:27:30.828
Because pussies are only
an inch and a half away from assholes.

01:27:33.457 --> 01:27:36.250
I don't know much
in this crazy, crazy world,

01:27:37.002 --> 01:27:42.006
but I do know that if you don't
let us fuck this asshole,

01:27:43.133 --> 01:27:46.052
we are gonna have our dicks
and our pussies

01:27:46.762 --> 01:27:48.679
all covered in shit.

01:28:05.530 --> 01:28:07.657
Show us what you're doing, Kim Jong II.

01:28:10.202 --> 01:28:12.328
Do something, Arec Barrwin!

01:28:12.788 --> 01:28:16.499
The... Global warming and...
Corporate America...

01:28:19.002 --> 01:28:21.462
You are worthress, Arec Barrwin.

01:28:31.598 --> 01:28:34.517
Don't fucking move!
You were all going to be treated

01:28:34.601 --> 01:28:36.936
to a faburous show.
But now party's over.

01:28:37.020 --> 01:28:39.271
- For I am the great Kim Jong II.
- Lisa.

01:28:39.356 --> 01:28:43.025
And I am the greatest terrorist
ever to have rived.

01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:45.069
Terrorize this.

01:29:00.877 --> 01:29:03.212
- Lisa, are you okay?
- No, Gary, the countdown.

01:29:03.296 --> 01:29:04.714
You have to stop it.

01:29:04.798 --> 01:29:07.842
- What do I do?
- Hit the big "cancel" button!

01:29:14.850 --> 01:29:17.518
- Gary, how did you manage this?
- Spottswoode helped me.

01:29:17.602 --> 01:29:19.270
Spottswoode? He's alive?

01:29:19.354 --> 01:29:23.733
Lisa, I'm crazy about you.
Will you please forgive me if I...

01:29:23.817 --> 01:29:26.068
You had me at "dicks fuck assholes."

01:29:27.279 --> 01:29:30.072
Attention. Attention, everyone.

01:29:30.490 --> 01:29:32.867
All you in the audience should go
to your homes now.

01:29:32.951 --> 01:29:36.078
Your countries need you.
But the world will be safe,

01:29:36.163 --> 01:29:39.165
thanks to a brilliant actor
named Gary Johnston.

01:29:58.977 --> 01:30:01.645
Let me explain to you
the kind of man Gary is.

01:30:02.647 --> 01:30:03.689
He's a man who knows

01:30:03.774 --> 01:30:07.151
that when you put another man's cock
in your mouth, you make a pact.

01:30:07.235 --> 01:30:09.403
A bond that cannot be broken.

01:30:09.488 --> 01:30:12.573
He's a man so dedicated that
he will get down on his knees

01:30:12.657 --> 01:30:14.325
and put that cock right in his mouth.

01:30:17.245 --> 01:30:18.913
Wait a minute. Look!

01:30:24.169 --> 01:30:27.254
You have not heard the rast
of Kim Jong II.

01:30:27.339 --> 01:30:29.048
I will return!

01:30:30.175 --> 01:30:33.719
You shall see. I will be back!

01:30:40.143 --> 01:30:43.020
So rong, earthrings!

01:30:44.898 --> 01:30:47.191
We'll be here waiting for you,
Kim Jong II.

01:30:47.943 --> 01:30:49.610
All right, you guys, I hate to break up
this little party,

01:30:49.694 --> 01:30:52.071
but there's still a lot of bad guys
out there.

01:30:52.155 --> 01:30:56.367
Well, then let's go show the bad guys
the police are back in force.

01:30:57.035 --> 01:31:00.037
Fuck, yeah.

01:31:01.915 --> 01:31:07.419
America

01:31:08.171 --> 01:31:11.090
- America

01:31:11.174 --> 01:31:13.968

- America
- Fuck, yeah

01:31:16.763 --> 01:31:20.015
Freedom is the only way, yeah

01:31:20.100 --> 01:31:22.351
Terrorists, your game is through

01:31:22.435 --> 01:31:24.979
'Cause now you have to answer to

01:31:25.063 --> 01:31:27.982
- America
- Fuck, yeah

01:31:28.066 --> 01:31:31.110
So lick my butt
And suck on my balls

01:31:31.194 --> 01:31:33.487
- America
- Fuck, yeah

01:31:33.572 --> 01:31:37.616
What you gonna do
When we come for you now?

01:31:37.951 --> 01:31:40.411
It's the dream that we all share

01:31:40.495 --> 01:31:45.207
- It's the hope for tomorrow
- Fuck, yeah

01:31:48.211 --> 01:31:49.753
- McDonald's
- Fuck, yeah

01:31:49.838 --> 01:31:51.046

01:31:51.131 --> 01:31:52.339

- Baseball
- Fuck, yeah

01:31:53.508 --> 01:31:54.717
- NFL

01:31:54.801 --> 01:31:56.135
- Rock 'n' roll
- Fuck, yeah

01:31:56.219 --> 01:31:57.553
- The Internet

01:31:57.637 --> 01:31:58.971
- Slavery
- Fuck, yeah

01:32:00.807 --> 01:32:02.600
Fuck, yeah

01:32:09.065 --> 01:32:12.151
Everyone has AIDS
My grandma and my dog Ole Blue

01:32:12.235 --> 01:32:16.071
- AIDS, AIDS, AIDS
- The Pope has got it and so do you

01:32:16.156 --> 01:32:18.866
Come on, everybody
We got quilting to do

01:32:18.950 --> 01:32:20.951
We're gonna break down
These barricades

01:32:21.036 --> 01:32:23.746
Everyone has
AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS

01:32:23.830 --> 01:32:25.956
AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS
AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS

01:32:26.041 --> 01:32:28.125
AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS
AIDS, AIDS

01:32:28.460 --> 01:32:30.920
Freedom isn't free

01:32:31.004 --> 01:32:34.506
It costs folks like you and me

01:32:35.258 --> 01:32:37.301
And if we don't all chip in

01:32:37.385 --> 01:32:41.931
We'll never pay that bill

01:32:43.141 --> 01:32:45.726
Freedom isn't free

01:32:46.269 --> 01:32:49.897
No, there's a hefty fucking fee

01:32:49.981 --> 01:32:56.487
And if you don't throw in
your buck-o-five, who will?

01:32:58.114 --> 01:32:59.615
Buck-o-five

01:33:00.242 --> 01:33:03.953
Freedom costs a buck-o-five

01:33:06.289 --> 01:33:11.835
Only a woman
Can brighten up my day

01:33:13.171 --> 01:33:19.551
Only a woman
Can touch me the right way, yeah

01:33:20.095 --> 01:33:25.599
Only a woman
Is allowed to touch me there

01:33:26.768 --> 01:33:31.188
All I ask
Is that you're a woman

01:33:33.692 --> 01:33:37.569
I'm so ronery

01:33:37.988 --> 01:33:39.655
So ronery

01:33:40.031 --> 01:33:43.075
So ronery and sadry arone

01:33:44.035 --> 01:33:47.663
There's no one
Just me onry

01:33:48.707 --> 01:33:51.875
Sitting on my rittle throne

01:33:52.544 --> 01:33:56.672
I work rearry hard
And make up great prans

01:33:56.756 --> 01:34:01.135
But nobody ristens
No one understands

01:34:01.219 --> 01:34:07.224
Seems rike no one
Takes me seriousry

01:34:07.892 --> 01:34:09.059
And so

01:34:09.561 --> 01:34:11.812
I'm ronery

01:34:13.315 --> 01:34:14.565
A rittle ronery

01:34:15.817 --> 01:34:19.862
Poor rittle me

01:34:31.666 --> 01:34:36.128
I need you like Ben Affleck
Needs acting school

01:34:36.588 --> 01:34:39.465
He was terrible in that film

01:34:39.758 --> 01:34:43.844
I need you like Cuba Gooding
needed a bigger part

01:34:44.679 --> 01:34:48.349
He's way better than Ben Affleck
And now

01:34:48.767 --> 01:34:52.770
All I can think about is your smile

01:34:52.854 --> 01:34:55.773
And that shitty movie, too

01:34:56.149 --> 01:34:57.900
Pearl Harbor sucked

01:34:58.610 --> 01:35:01.612
And I miss you

01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:15.584
Why does Michael Bay
Get to keep on making movies?

01:35:15.752 --> 01:35:18.796
I guess Pearl Harbor sucked

01:35:20.590 --> 01:35:25.636
Just a little bit more
Than I miss you

01:35:33.269 --> 01:35:35.896
Show a lot of things
Happening at once

01:35:35.980 --> 01:35:39.024
Remind everyone
Of what's going on

01:35:39.109 --> 01:35:42.277
And with every shot
Show a little improvement

01:35:42.362 --> 01:35:44.905
To show it all would take too long

01:35:44.989 --> 01:35:48.409
- That's called a montage
- Montage

01:35:48.493 --> 01:35:51.870
- Girl, we want a montage
- Montage

01:35:51.955 --> 01:35:55.165
In anything, if you want to go

01:35:55.250 --> 01:35:57.918
From just a beginner to a pro

01:35:58.002 --> 01:36:00.796
- You need a montage
- Montage

01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:04.508
- Even Rocky had a montage
- Montage

01:36:05.343 --> 01:36:11.098
- Always fade out in a montage
- Montage

01:36:11.182 --> 01:36:13.767
If you fade out
It seems like more time has passed

01:36:13.852 --> 01:36:18.105
I was sent from planet Gyron
To conquer the Earth

01:36:18.189 --> 01:36:21.233
I had a terrific pran
I thought it would work

01:36:21.943 --> 01:36:25.195
Tried to get the earthrings
All to kill each other, you see

01:36:25.613 --> 01:36:29.450
But it all went wrong
And now I must decree

01:36:30.243 --> 01:36:34.538
You are worthress, Arec Barrwin
You are worthress, Arec Barrwin

01:36:34.789 --> 01:36:38.625
You failed in every way
And now my stock in you has farren

01:36:38.751 --> 01:36:42.254
Your career is starring
And you're worthress, Arec Barrwin

01:36:42.422 --> 01:36:46.884
That's why I brew your head off
And your children are all bawring

01:36:48.178 --> 01:36:52.097
Pranet Gyron is inhabited
With Zypods rike me

01:36:52.515 --> 01:36:55.726
But also with Barmacks
Who are giant bees

01:36:56.519 --> 01:37:00.063
The Zypods and the Barmacks
Are at constant war

01:37:00.356 --> 01:37:04.735
So we wanted a new home
And that's what Earth was for

01:37:05.278 --> 01:37:10.073
But you are worthress, Arec Barrwin
You are worthress, Arec Barrwin

01:37:10.158 --> 01:37:11.742
You fucked up my whole pran

01:37:11.826 --> 01:37:14.786
And now Gyron is smeared
With Barmack porren

01:37:14.871 --> 01:37:18.665
Your garbage needs some hauring
And you're worthress, Arec Barrwin

01:37:18.750 --> 01:37:21.835
Now I must return home a failure

01:37:22.170 --> 01:37:28.759
I'm afraid the Pit of Cryrock
Is carring

01:37:29.305 --> 01:37:35.366
