01:06.816 --> 01:11.000
Greetings.
Konnichiwa.

01:11.738 --> 01:14.000
Greetings.
Konnichiwa.

01:16.868 --> 01:20.000
Greetings.
Konnichiwa.

01:20.955 --> 01:24.000
Greetings.
Konnichiwa.

01:32.800 --> 01:35.000
I haven't seen that face for a while.
How was Miami?

01:35.929 --> 01:37.000
We opened Saturday.

01:38.140 --> 01:41.000
I hope you packed snowshoes.
JFK took me three hours.

01:41.726 --> 01:44.000
-You in town for a while?
-Next stop is Tokyo.

01:45.188 --> 01:47.000
-You're taking over the world!
-That's the idea.

01:47.941 --> 01:48.000
Merry Christmas.

01:59.119 --> 02:02.000
Central Mexico

02:52.297 --> 02:54.000
How long have you
been following me?

02:54.716 --> 02:56.000
Since you took my innertube.

02:58.636 --> 03:02.000
I was going to return it.
I hope you don't mind.

03:03.990 --> 03:05.000
-Keep it. He's in love with you.
-Shut up!

03:07.620 --> 03:10.000
How can you be in love
with someone you just met?

03:10.648 --> 03:14.000
When I am eighteen, I will come
to Las Vegas and find you.

03:15.945 --> 03:20.000
When you're eighteen,
I will be forty.

03:22.410 --> 03:24.000
Are you going to marry
the policeman?

03:32.300 --> 03:34.000
I wish I knew...

03:43.980 --> 03:44.000
Am I on the right floor?

03:45.160 --> 03:48.000
Who are you and why
don't you work for a living?

03:48.978 --> 03:51.000
-He's back.
-Mr. On Time and Under Budget.

03:51.940 --> 03:53.000
Long time, no see!

03:54.250 --> 03:56.000
-Why the fish?
-It's a keychain.

03:56.653 --> 03:59.000
Why the party?
We still design nightclubs?

03:59.614 --> 04:01.000
Not during the holidays.

04:01.533 --> 04:03.000
-Merry Christmas.
-Sushi?

04:09.791 --> 04:14.000
Yo, Hemingway!
Hold up. Not so fast.

04:15.338 --> 04:17.000
I see your divorce
left you shattered.

04:18.382 --> 04:23.000
I found two women who understand
my pain. Don't go in there.

04:23.304 --> 04:25.000
-Why?
-Charlie Peters got Tokyo.

04:25.640 --> 04:28.000
He leaves tomorrow.
You're taking Vegas.

04:28.643 --> 04:32.000
-I was supposed to get Tokyo!
-You do not want Tokyo!

04:32.355 --> 04:35.000
I don't?
I want Las Vegas?

04:35.817 --> 04:38.000
Everything famous about
Las Vegas is about leaving it!

04:38.945 --> 04:43.000
That movie, the song.
The mob left Las Vegas.

04:45.952 --> 04:48.000
Just get in there!

04:49.956 --> 04:52.000
Look.
This could get me fired.

04:53.209 --> 04:57.000
This morning, I closed a deal
to buy a 50,000 square foot space...

04:58.131 --> 05:00.000
...across from the Royalton.

05:00.633 --> 05:06.000
If you play your cards right, you come
home to the sweetest gig ever.

05:06.598 --> 05:10.000
-The Midtown Club.
-And who'll still be eating sushi?

05:10.602 --> 05:12.000
Charlie Peters!

05:17.317 --> 05:19.000
We have conference rooms.

05:23.114 --> 05:25.000
He just needed a hug, sir.

05:29.245 --> 05:34.000
It's the holidays that-
It's just so hard. Excuse me.

05:42.550 --> 05:44.000
I'm afraid I need you in Vegas.

05:45.345 --> 05:50.000
Did you say Vegas?
That's my favourite city in the world!

06:43.278 --> 06:47.000
It's a family business. Everybody
in town tried to steal this guy.

06:48.199 --> 06:51.000
That's why I want him.
Thanks for the hustle!

06:52.162 --> 06:54.000
Your keys.
I got you groceries.

06:55.248 --> 06:57.000
Are you sure you don't prefer a hotel?

06:58.168 --> 06:59.000
Too many distractions.

07:00.170 --> 07:02.000
Hot! Hot! Hot!

07:04.174 --> 07:06.000
It's January, for chrissake!

07:35.914 --> 07:41.000
Chuy, I'm not ready for marriage.
And I love you, but not like that.

07:41.711 --> 07:47.000
I think we should see other people.
What do you think?

07:47.467 --> 07:50.000
Lose the part about seeing
other people. You're right.

07:51.221 --> 07:55.000
My great-grandmother said
I should wait for a sign.

07:55.433 --> 07:58.000
That necklace he got me?
It broke.

07:58.478 --> 08:01.000
I must pee. I'll talk to you
when I get home.

08:02.691 --> 08:07.000
I haven't stopped since Nogales!
Okay? I got to go. Bye.

08:17.122 --> 08:22.000
-Excuse me, I was here.
-I would have noticed.

08:23.378 --> 08:28.000
I was on the phone, the line moved.
I couldn't move with it...

08:29.175 --> 08:32.000
...because the cord
wouldn't stretch that far!

08:32.886 --> 08:36.000
I'd like to believe you,
but your nose is growing.

08:37.808 --> 08:40.000
Come on!
That was pretty good.

08:44.357 --> 08:48.000
-You realize I could die for this?
-I pee really fast.

08:48.945 --> 08:51.000
I have five brothers, three cousins
and one bathroom.

08:52.240 --> 08:56.000
-I pee faster than anybody.
-A gold medalist.

08:57.787 --> 08:59.000
This I have to see!

09:11.634 --> 09:13.000
I was just about to say that.

09:15.180 --> 09:19.000
I said not to be a pig
in front of our new priest.

09:20.977 --> 09:25.000
-That's Father Alex, to you.
-I'm Isabel.

09:29.319 --> 09:32.000
All that "waiting for a sign" stuff...

09:33.310 --> 09:36.000
...is that religious or cultural?

09:36.576 --> 09:39.000
Do you always listen
to other's conversations?

09:40.914 --> 09:44.000
Do you want to go
to the end of the line?

09:45.100 --> 09:48.000
-Why do you want to know?
-It sounded a little deep for-

09:51.883 --> 09:55.000
It just sounded a little deep
for a Friday night.

09:56.346 --> 10:00.000
Religion is important in our culture,
at least in my family.

10:01.142 --> 10:04.000
Your destiny
has already been decided.

10:04.437 --> 10:07.000
You just have to read the signs.

10:09.609 --> 10:11.000
You don't believe that?

10:12.737 --> 10:16.000
If a bus hits a guy,
it's because he wasn't looking.

10:16.908 --> 10:19.000
Not because of a master plan.

10:19.369 --> 10:24.000
It wasn't fate that you were in
this line when I got off the phone?

10:25.792 --> 10:30.000
No, I think it was more
of a bladder thing.

10:31.214 --> 10:35.000
That's too bad.
Because, you see...

10:35.802 --> 10:42.000
...I think there's an explanation
beyond reason, beyond all logic...

10:42.767 --> 10:46.000
...that brought you
to this very spot...

10:46.813 --> 10:52.000
...at the exact same time
I showed up at this very spot.

10:53.194 --> 10:56.000
-You do?
-Absolutely.

10:57.991 --> 11:00.000
And why would fate go
to all that trouble?

11:02.996 --> 11:06.000
So I wouldn't have
to wait in line.

11:10.860 --> 11:11.000
Thanks.

12:25.995 --> 12:28.000
3 Months Later

12:41.261 --> 12:42.000
Thank you.

12:44.973 --> 12:50.000
-We meet Tracy, 5:30 at your place.
-Alcoholic Beverage Commission?

12:50.478 --> 12:54.000
-The power this woman abuses!
-I know she's important!

12:54.607 --> 12:57.000
She sounded blonde.
Audibly blonde.

12:59.571 --> 13:01.000
She's married to the
county supervisor.

13:01.906 --> 13:04.000
-Don't hit on her.
-I'll get wine.

13:05.535 --> 13:08.000
-Don't hit on this woman!
-I'll make it expensive.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.000
He's going to hit on her.

13:13.710 --> 13:14.000
Incoming!

13:22.344 --> 13:24.000
It's a long story...

13:30.226 --> 13:34.000
-I'm looking for Alex.
-You know, he just ducked out.

13:34.481 --> 13:37.000
Shoot!
I thought I might catch him.

13:38.568 --> 13:43.000
We've been trading calls for months,
but he's always so busy.

13:43.365 --> 13:48.000
-Leave him a note. There's a pad.
-No, no that's okay.

13:50.705 --> 13:54.000
I'm Catherine Stewart.
Our families are old friends.

13:55.210 --> 13:57.000
-Alex.
-He went to the store.

13:57.921 --> 14:01.000
-His car's outside.
-He took a bulldozer, okay?

14:05.929 --> 14:10.000
-He's always in three places at once.
-That is our Alex.

14:18.240 --> 14:21.000
-You've been avoiding that?
-Since third grade.

14:22.404 --> 14:27.000
No one plans to end up in Vegas.
It kind of sneaks up on you.

14:27.826 --> 14:29.000
It's the fastest-growing city.

14:29.911 --> 14:35.000
The economy is booming! Business too.
I'm drowning in paperwork.

14:36.167 --> 14:40.000
Frankly, it's not a whole lot of fun.

14:41.756 --> 14:44.000
Are you a whole lot of fun?

14:47.429 --> 14:52.000
Jeff said we may have problems
with our liquor license.

14:53.685 --> 14:56.000
I'll talk to the county supervisor.

14:56.563 --> 15:00.000
I'd pay more attention
to the ABC investigation.

15:01.260 --> 15:03.000
They'll ask personal questions.

15:04.279 --> 15:07.000
They'd love to catch you
with your pants down.

15:09.367 --> 15:15.000
Then they should look into Jeff.
He actually heads up our...

15:16.820 --> 15:18.000
...pants down department.

15:20.962 --> 15:23.000
Will you get some ice?

15:25.925 --> 15:28.000
And put some scotch in it!

15:30.138 --> 15:32.000
One scotch, coming up.

15:33.183 --> 15:36.000
I'm afraid I'm out of scotch,
so let's go eat.

15:38.480 --> 15:40.000
Quid pro quo, pal.

15:40.774 --> 15:46.000
-Give it to her, she gives it to us.
-I can't do this!

15:53.328 --> 15:54.000
Hello.

15:56.810 --> 15:57.000
I thought...

15:58.750 --> 16:02.000
-I must have the wrong house.
-No! Wait!

16:02.962 --> 16:06.000
-If you want Alex, he's inside.
-He is?

16:10.428 --> 16:12.000
Excuse me. Alex?

16:12.847 --> 16:15.000
-You have a visitor.
-I do?

16:17.852 --> 16:21.000
-Excuse me.
-Well, don't be long.

16:34.869 --> 16:35.000
Isabel!

16:36.955 --> 16:38.000
You remembered.

16:38.707 --> 16:42.000
How could I forget?
I've looked all over for you.

16:42.460 --> 16:46.000
I would have called,
but you disappeared on me.

16:46.673 --> 16:51.000
I didn't know what to do.
I never did anything like that before.

16:52.120 --> 16:55.000
-Going home with a stranger.
-You and me both!

16:56.160 --> 16:59.000
It was just one of those great...

17:00.186 --> 17:01.000
...phenomenal...

17:02.439 --> 17:05.000
...spontaneous things.

17:07.680 --> 17:08.000
Yes, it was.

17:13.157 --> 17:17.000
-So, how long has it been?
-Three months.

17:17.494 --> 17:21.000
Do you mind if I have some?
My stomach is not so good.

17:21.833 --> 17:26.000
Go ahead, help yourself.
Want something to drink? I've got...

17:27.500 --> 17:28.000
...water.

17:28.464 --> 17:30.000
Yeah, water's fine.

17:35.180 --> 17:36.000
You've done a lot here.

17:38.183 --> 17:40.000
Yeah, I've been kind of busy.

17:48.526 --> 17:50.000
You look great.

17:52.197 --> 17:53.000
Thank you.

17:54.199 --> 17:56.000
So, how you been?

17:58.286 --> 18:02.000
-Pregnant.
-Really? Pregnant?

18:02.999 --> 18:07.000
Well, that's great. Terrific.
Congratulations.

18:08.171 --> 18:10.000
Thank you. It's yours.

18:21.309 --> 18:25.000
Mine?
We were together one night.

18:26.640 --> 18:29.000
-That's all it took.
-And I used a condom.

18:29.984 --> 18:32.000
-Lots of them.
-One didn't work.

18:33.655 --> 18:39.000
But, its job is to work!
Its reason for being is to work!

18:41.454 --> 18:42.000
Look...

18:45.250 --> 18:47.000
...I've thought about this a lot.

18:47.877 --> 18:51.000
And there's only one thing to do.

18:52.700 --> 18:53.000
Oh, dear God!

18:55.593 --> 18:59.000
I mean... I understand.

18:59.514 --> 19:03.000
-And I respect your decision.
-You do?

19:03.435 --> 19:07.000
I believe in a woman's
right to choose.

19:07.272 --> 19:10.000
Good. Because I choose
to keep this baby.

19:15.739 --> 19:20.000
I don't want your money.
The honourable thing to do would be...

19:21.369 --> 19:26.000
...to come here and tell you
in person that I am pregnant.

19:27.709 --> 19:30.000
That I'm keeping this baby.

19:30.503 --> 19:32.000
And that it's yours.

19:33.965 --> 19:36.000
But- Yeah, I'm glad you...

19:39.471 --> 19:44.000
I'm feeling neglected out there!
It's time we went to dinner.

19:44.476 --> 19:47.000
Tracy, could you give me
a minute, please?

19:48.188 --> 19:52.000
-Sorry, I came at a bad time.
-I'll go get my purse.

19:52.525 --> 19:54.000
I'll let myself out.

20:00.408 --> 20:03.000
I know the perfect place.

20:09.417 --> 20:11.000
If you recommend it,
it'll be great.

20:12.450 --> 20:16.000
I'll catch up with you. I've got
a bit of a family emergency.

20:17.800 --> 20:20.000
What are you doing?
What're you doing?

20:22.681 --> 20:24.000
Alex, don't! Alex!

20:25.160 --> 20:27.000
Alex is going to meet us there.

21:08.143 --> 21:10.000
Shit! Sorry!
Shit!

21:29.800 --> 21:30.000
Oh, my God!

21:32.459 --> 21:33.000
Don't jump!

21:34.200 --> 21:37.000
-What're you doing here?
-Stay off the ledge!

21:37.630 --> 21:41.000
I won't kill myself! But if you come
closer I'll throw you over!

21:42.135 --> 21:46.000
You walked out on me at 5 a. m.
I never heard from you.

21:46.848 --> 21:50.000
Months later you show up pregnant,
and I'm supposed to know what to do?

21:51.190 --> 21:55.000
I'm sorry, but I don't know
exactly what to do!

21:56.649 --> 21:59.000
That's the best thing
you've said all night.

22:07.327 --> 22:11.000
-This is incredible.
-I love it here.

22:12.582 --> 22:14.000
My great-grandfather helped build it.

22:15.430 --> 22:17.000
He came from Aguascalientes
in the '30s.

22:17.754 --> 22:21.000
Really?
Where?

22:22.467 --> 22:24.000
Central Mexico.

22:24.469 --> 22:28.000
My great-grandmother is still there,
in a 400-year-old hacienda.

22:29.724 --> 22:33.000
Every time I drive back,
I make a wish at the state line.

22:33.353 --> 22:36.000
-Right in the middle of the dam.
-Does it ever work?

22:37.650 --> 22:38.000
It depends on the wish.

22:46.866 --> 22:48.000
My father's going to kill me.

22:58.461 --> 22:59.000
He doesn't know?

23:01.339 --> 23:04.000
No. Nobody does.

23:04.801 --> 23:06.000
Except Lanie, my roommate.

23:07.721 --> 23:11.000
He can be very passionate
about his only daughter.

23:12.976 --> 23:14.000
Isabel, what can I do?

23:16.146 --> 23:19.000
-I'll deal with it.
-No. Really. I want to help.

23:24.571 --> 23:26.000
Maybe one thing.

23:27.741 --> 23:29.000
Come meet them.

23:30.243 --> 23:33.000
-Your family?
-I want them to know you.

23:33.580 --> 23:37.000
Later, when they ask me
who the father is, I can say:

23:37.584 --> 23:41.000
"You met him, remember?
I brought him home once. "

23:42.130 --> 23:47.000
No problem. You just say when
and we'll go.

23:47.469 --> 23:48.000
When.

23:49.596 --> 23:53.000
-You eat with your family weekly?
-It's like a tradition.

23:53.767 --> 23:56.000
-Why? Don't you?
-No.

23:57.228 --> 24:00.000
-Holidays and stuff.
-That's it?

24:00.398 --> 24:02.000
With my parents, that's a lot.

24:03.860 --> 24:05.000
How'll we do this?

24:05.820 --> 24:08.000
Act like we've been dating
for a few months.

24:08.907 --> 24:12.000
And don't tell them I picked you up
outside a bathroom.

24:13.995 --> 24:17.000
I thought I picked you up.

24:22.170 --> 24:24.000
We've been dating a couple months.

24:25.715 --> 24:29.000
-Who are you?
-Oh, well, let's see.

24:29.969 --> 24:33.000
I am a camera girl at Caesar's.
"Would you like a souvenir?"

24:34.150 --> 24:38.000
That pays the bills. I'm doing
a photography book on the desert.

24:38.395 --> 24:42.000
I have five brothers.
The oldest one is Antonio.

24:42.273 --> 24:47.000
Then Carlos, Juan, Miguel,
Fernando and I am the baby.

24:47.654 --> 24:50.000
But anyone messes with me,
I take care of myself.

24:51.366 --> 24:55.000
Tio Roberto is my favourite.
He's married to Tia Rosa.

24:55.620 --> 24:59.000
She loves compliments.
But talk to her on her left...

24:59.416 --> 25:02.000
...because she's stone-deaf
on her right ear.

25:02.919 --> 25:06.000
Never say "Jesus Christ"
in front of my mother.

25:06.297 --> 25:10.000
My sister-in-law, Petra, and Antonio
have a baby named after me.

25:10.343 --> 25:13.000
-Any questions?
-What's your last name?

25:14.970 --> 25:17.000
Fuentes. Isabel Fuentes.
And you're Alex...

25:17.517 --> 25:21.000
-Whitman.
-Right. Alex Whitman.

25:21.438 --> 25:22.000
Isabel Fuentes.

25:25.525 --> 25:27.000
It's nice to meet you.

25:31.698 --> 25:35.000
Hi! I was getting ice.
Everyone's around back.

25:35.744 --> 25:38.000
Who's this?
New boyfriend?

25:38.329 --> 25:42.000
Juan, this is Alex.
Alex, this is my nosy brother, Juan.

25:42.834 --> 25:45.000
-Nice to meet you.
-Does Dad know about him?

25:47.380 --> 25:49.000
And I wasn't going to come!

25:50.800 --> 25:51.000
Good luck!

25:52.469 --> 25:55.000
So, your father,
is he a big man, or...?

25:55.889 --> 25:58.000
Come on, let's do this.

26:14.240 --> 26:18.000
-This is a family dinner?
-A lot of people couldn't come.

26:30.600 --> 26:31.000
Tough room.

26:32.258 --> 26:36.000
What's wrong with everyone?
Can't I bring a guy to dinner?

26:41.351 --> 26:42.000
Hello, Isa.

26:47.691 --> 26:49.000
Hi, Chuy.

26:51.695 --> 26:52.000
Fine.

26:53.863 --> 26:57.000
It's been a long time
since you came to one of these.

26:57.867 --> 27:02.000
-I was afraid we'd never be friends.
-That's where we started, isn't it?

27:05.410 --> 27:09.000
Alex, this is Chuy.
He's a good friend of the family.

27:09.754 --> 27:11.000
We grew up together.

27:11.589 --> 27:14.000
Chuy, hi. Luke Skywalker.
How are you?

27:22.580 --> 27:25.000
Sorry.
You probably get that a lot.

27:29.858 --> 27:35.000
Yes, Chuy. He is my boyfriend.
Do you have a problem with that?

27:40.577 --> 27:44.000
It's a pleasure to meet you, Alex.
You're a very lucky man.

27:45.165 --> 27:50.000
There's nobody like Isa.
Nobody.

27:58.845 --> 28:00.000
What happened to the music?

28:10.230 --> 28:11.000
Seems like a nice guy.

28:14.270 --> 28:15.000
He's going to kill me.

28:15.904 --> 28:20.000
He's not the one
you should worry about.

28:24.621 --> 28:25.000
My beautiful baby!

28:29.420 --> 28:30.000
Who is this?

28:31.586 --> 28:35.000
Mama, Papa,
this is Alex... Whitman.

28:36.591 --> 28:40.000
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Isabel talks about you all the time.

28:41.179 --> 28:44.000
Funny, she's never said
a word about you!

28:44.516 --> 28:46.000
Tomas, behave yourself.

28:46.267 --> 28:50.000
One minute she's engaged,
then she brings a man with a tie!

28:50.647 --> 28:52.000
I was not engaged!

28:52.982 --> 28:54.000
I was not engaged!

28:55.151 --> 29:01.000
That's one of my favourite things about
her. She's always full of surprises.

29:06.955 --> 29:10.000
Come on, Alex.
We'll be safer in the other room.

29:13.253 --> 29:15.000
Let me take your jacket.

29:18.383 --> 29:21.000
You'll have to excuse my husband.

29:21.636 --> 29:26.000
Sometimes I think he wishes
Isabel was still 6 years old.

29:27.767 --> 29:31.000
When you're a father,
you'll understand.

29:34.149 --> 29:38.000
-These pictures are incredible.
-They're Isabel's.

29:39.154 --> 29:43.000
-Haven't you ever seen her work?
-Yes, yes, yes, I have.

29:44.451 --> 29:47.000
It's just that
when I see her pictures...

29:49.664 --> 29:52.000
...it's like it's the first time.

29:53.293 --> 29:58.000
-That must be the house in Mexico.
-Aguascalientes. And that...

29:59.215 --> 30:03.000
...is Isabel's great-grandmother.
They have a special connection.

30:04.540 --> 30:08.000
You can see it in the eyes.
That same wild spirit.

30:08.516 --> 30:10.000
-I can handle my love life.
-Since when?

30:10.643 --> 30:12.000
I think that runs in the family.

30:25.825 --> 30:29.000
This is terrific!
The taste is amazing!

30:29.871 --> 30:34.000
You can't get tamales like this
in New York City!

30:34.876 --> 30:36.000
Why is he yelling at me?

30:36.920 --> 30:38.000
He thinks you're Rosa.

30:49.557 --> 30:51.000
This one's Rosa.

31:09.661 --> 31:11.000
She's beautiful.

31:15.750 --> 31:18.000
Would you hold her
while I fix myself a plate?

31:18.837 --> 31:23.000
-No, I don't think I should.
-You can.

31:23.883 --> 31:27.000
-Hold her head.
-Why? Does it come off?

31:28.179 --> 31:29.000
You'll do fine.

32:15.477 --> 32:19.000
How can so much stuff
come out of something so small?

32:21.941 --> 32:25.000
-Thank you for doing this.
-Are you kidding? They're great.

32:26.154 --> 32:29.000
I had no idea that families
actually talked at dinner.

32:32.786 --> 32:34.000
I'm glad they got to meet you.

32:45.632 --> 32:51.000
-They're going to hate me.
-No. I won't let them.

33:50.864 --> 33:55.000
Don't.
You'll just make it worse.

33:55.452 --> 33:58.000
Let me give you a number
so you can reach me.

33:59.831 --> 34:01.000
It's better this way.

34:02.167 --> 34:06.000
No complications.
Please, just don't.

34:16.306 --> 34:17.000
So...

34:18.159 --> 34:19.000
...take care.

34:20.476 --> 34:21.000
I will.

34:26.659 --> 34:27.000
You too.

34:55.949 --> 34:58.000
What're you doing?
Get out of the way!

35:02.560 --> 35:05.000
Don't do this!
There's nothing to say!

35:05.772 --> 35:07.000
Wait a minute.
There might be.

35:10.819 --> 35:14.000
This afternoon I couldn't decide
between a burger and tuna.

35:15.730 --> 35:18.000
But my life made sense.
You know?

35:19.786 --> 35:26.000
Now I know exactly what I want
and my life doesn't make any sense!

35:29.295 --> 35:34.000
I was doing fine this afternoon.
It was me then!

35:34.551 --> 35:37.000
Now, I don't know
what happened...

35:37.804 --> 35:41.000
...but between the tuna
and your aunt's tamales...

35:43.268 --> 35:46.000
I actually worried I had met
the woman of my dreams...

35:46.938 --> 35:49.000
...at the dry cleaners
and didn't notice.

35:49.733 --> 35:53.000
But then you show up
and I realize that's not true.

35:54.863 --> 35:56.000
Because you're the one.

35:57.157 --> 36:02.000
You are everything I never knew
I always wanted.

36:05.665 --> 36:07.000
I'm not sure what that means...

36:08.100 --> 36:11.000
...but I think it has
to do with the rest of my life.

36:14.700 --> 36:17.000
I think we should get married.
Right now!

38:36.274 --> 38:39.000
Look who decided
to grace us with his presence.

38:40.700 --> 38:42.000
Sorry, Jeff.
Could not be helped.

38:45.325 --> 38:48.000
You're not getting off so easy.
So?

38:49.370 --> 38:50.000
Who is she?

38:50.580 --> 38:54.000
I open the door and you're off
on a date with Jessica Rabbit.

38:54.376 --> 38:58.000
Her name is Isabel.
And it wasn't exactly a date.

38:59.381 --> 39:01.000
Okay.
That's informative.

39:02.800 --> 39:04.000
Jeff, what the hell is dating?

39:04.761 --> 39:09.000
A process of elimination where
you both present your best side...

39:09.432 --> 39:14.000
...and hide the real you.
That can only last three months.

39:14.437 --> 39:17.000
Then you spend three months
getting to know your real selves.

39:17.524 --> 39:21.000
Then one of you wants a commitment,
the other doesn't so you start over.

39:22.280 --> 39:23.000
I mean dating...

39:23.405 --> 39:25.000
...dating is stupid!

39:26.950 --> 39:29.000
What have you done
with my best friend?

39:29.577 --> 39:33.000
You and Karen dated five years before
you married. Look what happened.

39:33.915 --> 39:36.000
Wait, you're using the " M" word?

39:37.850 --> 39:40.000
There's a woman on line one.
She says she's your wife.

39:40.505 --> 39:43.000
The only wife around is my ex.
And I am not in.

39:43.633 --> 39:46.000
Ask her if I can call her back.
Get her phone number!

39:49.139 --> 39:52.000
You married her?
The one with the body?

39:53.143 --> 39:54.000
You're married?

39:56.521 --> 39:59.000
Alex, does my life
mean nothing to you?

39:59.983 --> 40:03.000
-It'll be okay.
-No, it won't!

40:03.737 --> 40:06.000
-Who says it will?
-You gamble either way!

40:06.656 --> 40:10.000
You're pissed I won on the first pull
instead of putting quarters...

40:10.785 --> 40:12.000
...in the wrong machine
for 5 years!

40:12.912 --> 40:17.000
Those were silver dollars. And that
slot machine now owns my house.

40:18.585 --> 40:22.000
-She says it's urgent.
-It's urgent. The nightmare begins.

40:23.214 --> 40:26.000
I can't believe it.
What were you thinking?

40:26.426 --> 40:29.000
It's out of character
for you.

40:29.304 --> 40:32.000
Why marry her... unless
you knocked her up?

40:34.392 --> 40:38.000
-You knocked her up?
-That had nothing to do with it.

40:39.314 --> 40:45.000
Not to burst your bubble,
but do you know this baby's yours?

40:45.362 --> 40:50.000
-Did you do a blood test?
-She's my wife. It's not like that.

40:50.617 --> 40:52.000
-You don't know her.
-Neither do you!

40:59.292 --> 41:00.000
Fool!

41:11.971 --> 41:16.000
I welcome you in my home
and this is how you repay me?!

41:16.726 --> 41:19.000
Stealing my only daughter?!

41:20.522 --> 41:23.000
Getting married in that joke
of a chapel!

41:23.817 --> 41:25.000
Without a priest?!

41:25.485 --> 41:29.000
Without her family?
Without my consent?

41:32.909 --> 41:37.000
You are not a man.
You are a thief, that's what you are!

41:45.338 --> 41:46.000
Jesus.

41:48.758 --> 41:50.000
In-laws.

41:51.761 --> 41:54.000
He disowns me? Fine.
I disown him twice.

41:54.848 --> 41:57.000
Me and the baby disown him.
See how he likes that.

41:57.976 --> 42:01.000
Elvis gave you away.
Can you blame him?

42:02.630 --> 42:05.000
-How'd your mom take it?
-I'm a sinner. She went to church.

42:06.109 --> 42:09.000
-That bad.
-She's lit every candle in the city.

42:09.612 --> 42:12.000
-Hello, my wife.
-Hello, my husband.

42:12.407 --> 42:17.000
-Did you decorate the house yourself?
-I realize it is a little dull.

42:17.787 --> 42:22.000
-It's the cosy institutional thing.
-Not after I spice it up.

42:22.751 --> 42:27.000
-It's just for the next 4 months.
-Then you turn back into a frog?

42:28.298 --> 42:31.000
No, then we go back
to New York.

42:31.634 --> 42:34.000
-We what?
-We go back to...

42:35.638 --> 42:36.000
...New York.

42:39.392 --> 42:41.000
You don't live here?

42:46.316 --> 42:50.000
-No, I live in Manhattan.
-I live here. I like it.

42:50.779 --> 42:56.000
My family, friends and work are here.
You can't raise a baby there.

42:56.743 --> 43:00.000
People do it all the time.
Have you ever been there?

43:00.997 --> 43:04.000
-No.
-Well, there you go.

43:04.918 --> 43:09.000
You've never been off the strip.
There's more to Nevada than Vegas.

43:09.839 --> 43:14.000
-Like legal prostitution?
-That's a guy thing to say.

43:15.345 --> 43:18.000
If it's any consolation,
I hated it at first.

43:19.150 --> 43:22.000
But Vegas grows on you
after a while.

43:23.478 --> 43:26.000
Let me explain something.
Las Vegas is a sandbox.

43:27.107 --> 43:31.000
A sandbox for adults with money.
New York is New York.

43:31.695 --> 43:35.000
You got culture, museums,
and the Yankees!

43:35.740 --> 43:39.000
Every New York guy thinks
there's nothing west of the Hudson!

43:39.369 --> 43:41.000
-Every Las Vegas girl-
-Shut up.

43:42.163 --> 43:43.000
We'll let them talk.

43:44.541 --> 43:47.000
I've saved to do
this book for five years.

43:47.794 --> 43:52.000
I just paid off my camera equipment.
My life is here.

43:55.969 --> 43:59.000
And my work
is in New York.

43:59.597 --> 44:03.000
This is what usually
happens on the second date.

44:42.640 --> 44:47.000
Small, ugly thing biting me!
Small, ugly thing biting me!

44:49.356 --> 44:52.000
Stop it!
Stop it. Stop it, baby.

44:53.443 --> 44:54.000
Hi.

44:54.903 --> 44:57.000
This is Che, my dog.
I mean, our dog.

44:57.614 --> 45:02.000
-Welcome home.
-I can't believe it's the same house.

45:02.452 --> 45:07.000
I know! Isn't it great?
It's their wedding present.

45:07.332 --> 45:09.000
See, not everyone
feels like my father.

45:10.210 --> 45:14.000
They wanted to do something
special for us. Say "thank you. "

45:14.297 --> 45:18.000
Thank you! It's very special.

45:21.638 --> 45:23.000
You don't like it.

45:23.932 --> 45:27.000
I just never lived in anything
so bright and-

45:27.602 --> 45:29.000
Jesus Christ!

45:30.522 --> 45:32.000
Isn't it beautiful?

45:32.440 --> 45:36.000
It's been in my family for centuries
and will protect us.

45:36.611 --> 45:38.000
Can't we just trade Cujo
for a Doberman?

45:38.988 --> 45:43.000
That isn't funny, Alex.
You're hurting my baby's feelings.

45:44.327 --> 45:46.000
What did your parents say?

45:47.205 --> 45:50.000
I forgot they went to
Europe for the summer.

45:52.502 --> 45:55.000
-It's April.
-They like to get there early.

45:56.890 --> 46:00.000
So you did all this in one day?
I should hire you to build the club.

46:01.177 --> 46:03.000
I don't know that you can afford us.

46:06.570 --> 46:07.000
You are so cute.

46:08.226 --> 46:13.000
Here. I'm going to get my camera
and take a picture of my family.

46:19.529 --> 46:20.000
What are you looking at?

48:07.971 --> 48:10.000
So this is where you go every day.

48:11.160 --> 48:13.000
It opened last night.
I got complaints.

48:13.601 --> 48:17.000
The fact that there are no
walls upset people.

48:18.273 --> 48:21.000
It's going to be wonderful.
I can tell.

48:22.277 --> 48:28.000
I wanted you to be the first guest
at our best table.

48:29.617 --> 48:32.000
And I'm very honoured.

48:36.207 --> 48:38.000
Oh, Alex, this is so romantic.

48:40.420 --> 48:41.000
The candles...

48:42.130 --> 48:44.000
And the wine.
I mean, the milk.

48:45.800 --> 48:46.000
And pizza.

48:47.677 --> 48:49.000
It's perfect.

48:49.637 --> 48:53.000
Perfect would be New York
and a Gray's Papaya hot dog.

48:53.850 --> 48:58.000
-What's a Gray's Papaya?
-Four blocks from my apartment.

48:58.355 --> 49:01.000
The best hot dog in the world.

49:03.610 --> 49:07.000
And if we were in Mexico
we would be eating...

49:07.947 --> 49:11.000
-... albondigas.
-Albondigas.

49:12.350 --> 49:15.000
They're this sort
of meatball soup.

49:15.288 --> 49:17.000
My great-grandmother
is famous for them.

49:18.833 --> 49:21.000
You have to come
with me one day.

49:21.711 --> 49:27.000
You'd love it. There are no
phones, no electricity, no people.

49:27.634 --> 49:29.000
No kidding.

49:31.721 --> 49:36.000
There's a spot in Central Park,
the Bethesda Fountain...

49:36.893 --> 49:41.000
...where if you sit there long enough,
the entire city walks by.

49:43.692 --> 49:48.000
And I know a canyon
where if you sit there long enough...

49:48.405 --> 49:51.000
...nobody finds you.
And you die.

49:53.159 --> 49:54.000
Really?

49:55.870 --> 49:57.000
I couldn't believe it.

49:57.414 --> 50:00.000
The whole night he changed
the subject to New York.

50:01.334 --> 50:04.000
What do you expect?
His life is not your life.

50:04.546 --> 50:08.000
-You're on my side?
-He has a family to support.

50:08.550 --> 50:10.000
We can do it together, here.

50:10.760 --> 50:13.000
Marriage is about finding
a middle ground.

50:13.471 --> 50:15.000
Learn to pick your battles.

50:16.474 --> 50:21.000
-I sure picked one this morning.
-What did you do?

50:21.980 --> 50:24.000
I had the guys drop by
to take him shooting.

50:25.817 --> 50:28.000
Alex is alone with your brothers?

50:28.903 --> 50:30.000
And Chuy.

50:31.114 --> 50:33.000
I better light another candle.

50:41.499 --> 50:44.000
Isabel said there's some interesting
canyons here.

50:44.836 --> 50:47.000
One in particular where people
go to die?

50:48.600 --> 50:49.000
That's the other way, right?

50:50.800 --> 50:52.000
What's this about you taking
Isabel to New York?

50:53.345 --> 50:57.000
That's just an idea.
There's nothing carved in stone.

50:57.432 --> 51:00.000
She won't go.
I bet my life on it.

51:00.810 --> 51:04.000
No one here expects someone
to give up his life.

51:04.564 --> 51:06.000
Do they, Chuy?

51:10.945 --> 51:13.000
What'll you be? Isabel Fuentes?
Isabel Whitman?

51:13.990 --> 51:16.000
Or do a Hilary and be Isabel
Fuentes-Whitman?

51:16.701 --> 51:18.000
That's Mrs. Alex Whitman to you.

51:18.953 --> 51:19.000
Pardon me.

51:20.288 --> 51:22.000
I'm sorry, excuse me.

51:22.665 --> 51:23.000
Excuse me.

51:24.918 --> 51:30.000
I didn't mean to eavesdrop.
Did you just say "Alex Whitman"?

51:30.340 --> 51:35.000
-From Connecticut?
-I think that's where he's from.

51:35.804 --> 51:39.000
Late 20s, 6 feet tall,
dark hair, talks with his hands?

51:39.974 --> 51:41.000
That's him.

51:44.979 --> 51:49.000
I'm sorry, I'm Cathy Stewart.
Our families are old friends.

51:49.401 --> 51:52.000
You're kidding!
Oh, that's fantastic.

51:52.821 --> 51:56.000
I don't know any of his friends
so I'm glad to meet you.

51:56.449 --> 51:58.000
I'm Isabel, this is Lanie.

52:01.329 --> 52:05.000
I've missed Alex the last couple
of trips out here.

52:05.458 --> 52:08.000
He's always so busy.
How do you know him?

52:10.422 --> 52:13.000
-I'm his wife.
-I beg your pardon?

52:15.260 --> 52:17.000
Alex and I,
we're married.

52:19.139 --> 52:21.000
And they're having a baby.

52:22.934 --> 52:25.000
A baby?
Really?

52:28.189 --> 52:30.000
Well, congratulations.

52:31.943 --> 52:33.000
Isn't this a surprise!

52:42.829 --> 52:47.000
This is some back yard.
I can see why you like it up here.

52:48.126 --> 52:51.000
It must've been fun growing up.

52:54.466 --> 52:59.000
You know, all these rocks,
the open space, the view...

53:00.263 --> 53:02.000
...the birds...

53:04.590 --> 53:05.000
...the snakes.

53:21.993 --> 53:23.000
Do not move.

53:25.800 --> 53:28.000
Okay, everybody.
We do this on three. Ready?

53:34.255 --> 53:35.000
-Wait!
-One.

53:35.965 --> 53:37.000
-What're you doing?
-Two.

53:37.801 --> 53:39.000
-What?
-Three.

53:45.934 --> 53:47.000
I'm coming!

53:50.605 --> 53:54.000
Lucy, you've got
some 'splaining to do!

53:54.776 --> 53:57.000
Oh, my God.
What did you do to him?

53:57.987 --> 53:59.000
He fell into some cactus.

54:00.281 --> 54:02.000
A lot of cactus.
We gave him tequila.

54:03.760 --> 54:07.000
-The desert made a big impression.
-I told you to make it special!

54:07.622 --> 54:09.000
Not to kill him!

54:10.166 --> 54:13.000
Get out! Get the hell out of here!
You too! Come on!

54:15.755 --> 54:17.000
Baby?

54:18.967 --> 54:20.000
Honey?

54:22.470 --> 54:25.000
Whatever you do,
don't turn over.

54:26.141 --> 54:28.000
I'll get the tweezers.

54:47.787 --> 54:49.000
I'm confused.

54:50.498 --> 54:54.000
If babies only see in black
and white, then why...

54:54.419 --> 54:59.000
-... is Barney purple?
-Dinosaurs come later, tontito.

55:01.900 --> 55:02.000
Wait, don't sit there.

55:03.110 --> 55:05.000
-I'm doing the floors.
-Again?

55:06.560 --> 55:09.000
I read about this.
This is the nesting period, isn't it?

55:10.185 --> 55:14.000
It must be, because I can't get
this place clean enough.

55:21.946 --> 55:25.000
-I'm sorry. Poor baby.
-I think there's still one in there.

55:26.117 --> 55:31.000
Then we'll have to take the pants
off so that I can take a closer look.

55:31.915 --> 55:35.000
-Whatever you say, doctor.
-I forgot to tell you...

55:36.127 --> 55:40.000
...I ran into an old friend of yours.
Cathy something.

55:40.298 --> 55:41.000
Cathy Stewart?

55:42.133 --> 55:44.000
Really? When?

55:44.636 --> 55:49.000
Last week. The day of the cactus.
I think she's jealous.

55:50.580 --> 55:51.000
Really?

55:52.894 --> 55:54.000
I'll get it.

56:00.318 --> 56:01.000
Coming!

56:05.310 --> 56:06.000
-Surprise!
-Mom!

56:07.117 --> 56:08.000
Dad!

56:09.828 --> 56:11.000
This was her idea.

56:11.830 --> 56:15.000
Cathy said we just had
to get out here...

56:15.500 --> 56:19.000
-... and see what you were up to.
-She insisted. What is that?

56:21.890 --> 56:22.000
A squirrel?

56:23.258 --> 56:26.000
-Who is it?
-I got it, hon.

56:28.130 --> 56:30.000
Now that is a housekeeper.

56:32.350 --> 56:33.000
Did we come at a bad time?

56:35.610 --> 56:38.000
She's just cleaning the oven,
and the fumes are...

56:39.941 --> 56:43.000
Well, you're here.
You're really here.

56:52.203 --> 56:56.000
-Are you going to introduce us?
-Yes. Yes. This is...

57:01.379 --> 57:05.000
-Isabel.
-Isabel, right. Right.

57:06.968 --> 57:08.000
It's nice to meet you.

57:08.887 --> 57:12.000
I'm Alex's mother, Mrs. Whitman,
and this is Mr. Whitman.

57:12.599 --> 57:15.000
Oh, my God, you're his parents!

57:16.190 --> 57:21.000
My God, look at me. I'm a mess.
It's so great to finally meet you.

57:22.150 --> 57:25.000
But please, come in.

57:25.987 --> 57:27.000
Very friendly.

57:27.572 --> 57:30.000
You must be exhausted.
Want a drink?

57:31.159 --> 57:34.000
That is a great idea.
Why don't you get the drinks.

57:34.871 --> 57:37.000
I love you.
And I'll think of something.

57:37.957 --> 57:39.000
Who wants a cold beer?

57:39.793 --> 57:42.000
-Terrific.
-I'd love one.

57:42.587 --> 57:45.000
Don't tell them anything
until I come back.

57:45.965 --> 57:47.000
She is wonderful.

57:48.218 --> 57:53.000
There must be a lot of good help
here, so close to Mexico.

57:54.150 --> 57:56.000
-Such a warm people.
-Is this a company house?

57:57.180 --> 58:00.000
You'd think they could afford
a decent decorator.

58:00.855 --> 58:03.000
Dad, Mom, why don't you sit down?

58:08.710 --> 58:09.000
What is this?

58:11.241 --> 58:14.000
Honey, is there something wrong?

58:17.414 --> 58:23.000
Yes. I have to tell Isabel
where the bottle opener is.

58:23.837 --> 58:27.000
So how was Europe?
You came back soon.

58:27.674 --> 58:32.000
-Europe?
-Alex said you went for the summer.

58:32.303 --> 58:35.000
You know better.
We hate Europe in the summer.

58:36.182 --> 58:38.000
-Too many tourists.
-Europe in the summer.

58:40.729 --> 58:44.000
You lied to me.
All this time.

58:47.652 --> 58:48.000
Listen-

58:55.326 --> 58:59.000
-What does that mean?
-You're a liar and a coward.

59:02.375 --> 59:06.000
It sounded much prettier
in Spanish.

59:07.213 --> 59:09.000
Will you excuse me?

59:11.900 --> 59:14.000
Sounds like somebody's
about to get fired.

59:20.101 --> 59:22.000
-I was going to tell them.
-When?

59:22.562 --> 59:26.000
-After the baby's born?
-I didn't want to on the phone.

59:26.483 --> 59:31.000
My father won't even speak to me!
But I told him the truth.

59:31.738 --> 59:36.000
But you don't even have the balls to
call and let them know!

59:36.785 --> 59:38.000
What is it?

59:39.790 --> 59:43.000
Do you want out?
I'm not good enough for you?

59:43.917 --> 59:48.000
My family's not like yours.
I never see them.

59:48.588 --> 59:52.000
Excuses, excuses, excuses.
You should have told them!

59:52.759 --> 59:57.000
I wanted to in person. Why is that
so hard for you to understand?

01:00:02.477 --> 01:00:04.000
Here is your big chance.

01:00:10.819 --> 01:00:12.000
Mom, Dad...

01:00:13.488 --> 01:00:17.000
...I have some interesting
and exciting news.

01:00:20.161 --> 01:00:25.000
I'd like you to meet
Isabel Fuentes... Whitman.

01:00:26.251 --> 01:00:27.000
Oh, my God!

01:00:37.846 --> 01:00:41.000
I let them come.
That doesn't mean I have to like it.

01:00:41.683 --> 01:00:44.000
-Mama, do something.
-Why're you being difficult?

01:00:44.936 --> 01:00:49.000
They aren't her in-laws
because she's not married!

01:00:49.983 --> 01:00:52.000
If she's not married,
she has no in-laws!

01:00:52.610 --> 01:00:56.000
Why am I celebrating Cinco de Mayo
with strangers?

01:00:56.698 --> 01:00:59.000
They're strangers
because you won't talk to them!

01:01:00.285 --> 01:01:01.000
Tomas...

01:01:01.619 --> 01:01:06.000
...either you act like the man I
married, or sleep with the dogs!

01:01:15.383 --> 01:01:17.000
I hope you have plenty of lotion on.

01:01:19.346 --> 01:01:22.000
The desert sun kicks off this water
like a mirror.

01:01:23.641 --> 01:01:28.000
No, I think that if we just stay
in the shade, we'll be fine.

01:01:28.438 --> 01:01:31.000
Suit yourselves.
Pity you didn't bring suits.

01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:35.000
Well, we didn't exactly plan for this.

01:01:37.155 --> 01:01:39.000
Jesus Christ, is it hot!

01:01:46.498 --> 01:01:49.000
Senor, I'd like to tell
you something.

01:01:50.251 --> 01:01:54.000
I don't think these kids have a clue
what they are getting into.

01:01:55.298 --> 01:01:57.000
I couldn't agree more.

01:01:57.384 --> 01:01:58.000
-Really?
-Absolutely.

01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:01.000
Marriage is a serious commitment.

01:02:02.138 --> 01:02:06.000
I think that it's terribly romantic.

01:02:06.935 --> 01:02:09.000
Hon, you're not helping.

01:02:10.230 --> 01:02:11.000
I must agree with her.

01:02:12.148 --> 01:02:15.000
You men forget how foolish
you once were chasing us.

01:02:16.236 --> 01:02:18.000
This is different.
They are different.

01:02:19.322 --> 01:02:22.000
They come from a different culture,
a different world.

01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:27.000
It's hard enough to make a marriage
work without adding to it.

01:02:27.664 --> 01:02:30.000
Listen to the man, Alex.
He has a point.

01:02:30.792 --> 01:02:34.000
I think they're going to
start spelling words soon.

01:02:34.379 --> 01:02:38.000
-Can't you just be happy for us?
-I'm afraid for you.

01:02:38.717 --> 01:02:41.000
This wouldn't have happened
if he hadn't gone after you-

01:02:42.262 --> 01:02:47.000
Wait just a second, Tomas.
It takes two to tango.

01:02:48.590 --> 01:02:52.000
-She's as guilty as he is.
-Now let's just calm down, shall we?

01:02:53.231 --> 01:02:58.000
They fell in love.
And love is a beautiful thing.

01:03:00.113 --> 01:03:04.000
Ask yourself. Where will you live,
how will you raise your child?

01:03:05.577 --> 01:03:06.000
We don't know yet.

01:03:07.287 --> 01:03:08.000
You see?

01:03:08.621 --> 01:03:11.000
Let's start with the economics.
They'll live in New York.

01:03:12.167 --> 01:03:16.000
-Because that's where his job is.
-And the religion must be Catholic.

01:03:17.422 --> 01:03:18.000
Says who?

01:03:19.257 --> 01:03:23.000
The mother is Catholic.
Whatever the mother is, the baby is.

01:03:24.540 --> 01:03:29.000
-What is the matter with Presbyterian?
-That is not a religion.

01:03:29.684 --> 01:03:32.000
-I beg your pardon?
-Thomas, Tomas, whatever...

01:03:33.313 --> 01:03:37.000
This country was founded by people
escaping religious persecution.

01:03:38.260 --> 01:03:40.000
The Whitmans were one of them!

01:03:41.112 --> 01:03:44.000
When the west was stolen
from Mexico...

01:03:44.324 --> 01:03:46.000
...the Fuentes made a vow.

01:03:46.451 --> 01:03:49.000
Even though they took our land,
they'd never take our culture!

01:03:50.246 --> 01:03:52.000
Culture?
You call this culture?

01:03:52.874 --> 01:03:56.000
Guacamole and a ghetto blaster
in the middle of a desert?

01:03:56.586 --> 01:04:00.000
You're offending Amalia's dip?
What's wrong with it?

01:04:01.700 --> 01:04:06.000
In case you didn't notice,
the white people are melting out here!

01:04:32.380 --> 01:04:35.000
It was 112 degrees.
I fried an egg on my head.

01:04:35.333 --> 01:04:37.000
And he didn't mean "white. "

01:04:38.503 --> 01:04:42.000
-He meant, not tan.
-Don't go there.

01:04:42.424 --> 01:04:45.000
Your father wasn't helpful
with that Catholic talk.

01:04:46.302 --> 01:04:49.000
Alex, the first time I realized
I was pregnant...

01:04:50.181 --> 01:04:54.000
...I got stopped at a stoplight
in front of Saint Viviana's.

01:04:54.894 --> 01:04:57.000
You know what it was?
It was a sign.

01:04:57.897 --> 01:05:01.000
-Of what?
-That the baby would be Catholic.

01:05:01.526 --> 01:05:05.000
-At least it wasn't before an IHOP!
-Think that's funny?

01:05:05.947 --> 01:05:09.000
Religion is the opiate
of the masses, okay?

01:05:09.576 --> 01:05:12.000
Country clubs
are filled with racists.

01:05:12.370 --> 01:05:16.000
Right, I agree. Do you think
a crucifix will protect you?

01:05:17.830 --> 01:05:21.000
Yes, I do. I believe
because I am a woman of faith.

01:05:21.296 --> 01:05:25.000
The faith I have
in that crucifix and in us...

01:05:25.633 --> 01:05:28.000
...comes from the same place
inside me!

01:05:28.345 --> 01:05:30.000
Now you, on the other hand...

01:05:31.723 --> 01:05:34.000
...you're not an active Presbyterian.

01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:40.000
So, why don't you want me to carry
my faith and belief to our child?

01:05:40.523 --> 01:05:45.000
-It's a good thing to do!
-It's not the only thing to do!

01:05:47.989 --> 01:05:49.000
Where're you going?

01:05:49.324 --> 01:05:52.000
-You aren't my favourite person now.
-Well, you either.

01:05:53.661 --> 01:05:58.000
Do you want my advice? Get out now.
I'll even file for you.

01:05:58.583 --> 01:06:02.000
-Who said lawyers don't have hearts?
-What did you expect?

01:06:02.962 --> 01:06:05.000
Your relationship
is built on heat.

01:06:05.632 --> 01:06:09.000
It's like Vegas.
Why didn't they build it on the sun?

01:06:09.511 --> 01:06:11.000
You're not the guy to talk to.

01:06:11.888 --> 01:06:14.000
I'm the perfect guy.
I know what you are trying to do.

01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:18.000
The longer you put this off,
the worse it'll be.

01:06:18.687 --> 01:06:21.000
Put what off?
I just said we had a fight.

01:06:21.731 --> 01:06:24.000
You said a lot more than that.
Look...

01:06:25.402 --> 01:06:28.000
...we're here to get a job done
and we're behind schedule.

01:06:29.197 --> 01:06:31.000
Cinco de Mayo fell
on a Tuesday!

01:06:31.533 --> 01:06:36.000
-The shit's going to hit the fan.
-Why? What's up?

01:06:36.538 --> 01:06:37.000
We had a visit from OSHA.

01:06:38.248 --> 01:06:42.000
Talk to the foreman. We came close
to a red-tag shutdown.

01:06:45.460 --> 01:06:46.000
Jesus.

01:06:46.715 --> 01:06:50.000
-I'll handle this, okay?
-Good.

01:07:01.271 --> 01:07:04.000
-May I help you?
-Isabel Fuentes... Whitman.

01:07:10.155 --> 01:07:14.000
-I thought you had work.
-I do, but I need to talk to you.

01:07:15.285 --> 01:07:17.000
I need to talk to you too.

01:07:17.579 --> 01:07:20.000
I feel really bad
about how things have been.

01:07:20.999 --> 01:07:23.000
Oh, no.
No, it was my fault.

01:07:25.837 --> 01:07:28.000
I haven't been honest with you.

01:07:30.717 --> 01:07:33.000
And I was thinking
on the way over...

01:07:34.471 --> 01:07:35.000
Hello, Isabel.

01:07:35.972 --> 01:07:39.000
-How are we today?
-We are fine.

01:07:39.976 --> 01:07:44.000
-You're the father. I'm Lisa Barnes.
-Alex Whitman.

01:07:44.314 --> 01:07:46.000
You're in time for the show.

01:07:48.234 --> 01:07:50.000
You want to watch?
Come over.

01:07:55.241 --> 01:07:58.000
-Will that hurt?
-Oh, no. It tickles.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.000
What is that?

01:08:06.860 --> 01:08:10.000
-That's your baby's heartbeat.
-It's so fast.

01:08:10.423 --> 01:08:11.000
It's normal.

01:08:11.758 --> 01:08:12.000
Neat, huh?

01:08:17.514 --> 01:08:19.000
There's the head.

01:08:20.517 --> 01:08:22.000
There's a leg.

01:08:24.229 --> 01:08:25.000
Wait a minute.

01:08:26.689 --> 01:08:28.000
Is that his...?

01:08:28.774 --> 01:08:30.000
Actually, I think that's an arm.

01:08:31.194 --> 01:08:34.000
It's too early to determine
the baby's sex.

01:08:37.450 --> 01:08:40.000
Let's take the first picture
of your baby.

01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:47.000
I'm sorry.

01:08:49.129 --> 01:08:50.000
Me too.

01:08:51.756 --> 01:08:56.000
I could hear its heartbeat
going " ba-doom-boom. "

01:08:56.803 --> 01:09:00.000
I spoke to New York.
Who's three weeks ahead of schedule?

01:09:01.569 --> 01:09:04.000
-Charlie Peters doesn't have a life.
-I'm just saying.

01:09:04.435 --> 01:09:08.000
-Where the hell is my crane?
-Foreman says tomorrow morning.

01:09:10.108 --> 01:09:11.000
Hello!

01:09:13.486 --> 01:09:15.000
What are you doing here?

01:09:16.310 --> 01:09:18.000
I've come to kidnap you.

01:09:18.742 --> 01:09:22.000
-This is really not a good day.
-Don't make me hurt you, gringo.

01:09:23.287 --> 01:09:26.000
It's his birthday
and I won't take no for an answer.

01:09:27.420 --> 01:09:28.000
Will you cover for me?

01:09:29.439 --> 01:09:32.000
-Please?
-Have a good time.

01:09:33.479 --> 01:09:35.000
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

01:09:39.804 --> 01:09:41.000
Where are we going?

01:09:41.639 --> 01:09:44.000
It's a surprise.
Big surprise.

01:09:48.772 --> 01:09:51.000
The very first time I came here...

01:09:51.941 --> 01:09:56.000
...my father told me about a family of
squirrels that lived on the plateau.

01:09:57.447 --> 01:10:00.000
He said that one day
the canyon split.

01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:03.000
Half the squirrels were
on the north rim...

01:10:03.953 --> 01:10:05.000
...and the other half
on the south.

01:10:06.331 --> 01:10:09.000
Over time, the two families
became different.

01:10:09.501 --> 01:10:12.000
Each one adjusted
to their environment.

01:10:12.545 --> 01:10:18.000
The ones to the north are dark,
bushy-tailed, and have bigger ears.

01:10:18.593 --> 01:10:23.000
The ones to the south are leaner,
meaner and much prettier.

01:10:25.475 --> 01:10:29.000
Even though they look different
and they act different...

01:10:29.938 --> 01:10:33.000
...they are the exact same squirrel.

01:10:33.775 --> 01:10:37.000
They just grew up
on different sides.

01:10:39.531 --> 01:10:43.000
And this canyon between them...

01:10:45.495 --> 01:10:48.000
...will they be able to cross it?

01:10:49.332 --> 01:10:50.000
Well...

01:10:52.127 --> 01:10:55.000
I've been thinking
of making you a deal.

01:10:56.470 --> 01:10:59.000
If we can stay here
until the baby's born...

01:11:00.218 --> 01:11:03.000
-... I'll move to New York.
-That's so great!

01:11:03.722 --> 01:11:07.000
I'm not saying I'll like it.
But I'll give it a try.

01:11:07.726 --> 01:11:09.000
You got a deal.

01:11:10.478 --> 01:11:13.000
Good, then I can give
you your present.

01:11:14.816 --> 01:11:16.000
You mean there's more?

01:11:18.319 --> 01:11:23.000
I called my new mother-in-law
and asked her to do me a favour.

01:11:25.827 --> 01:11:27.000
This arrived today.

01:11:42.594 --> 01:11:44.000
I can't believe you did this.

01:11:45.722 --> 01:11:49.000
Who said you can't have
the best of both worlds?

01:11:53.355 --> 01:11:57.000
This is the most wonderful birthday
I've ever had.

01:12:03.573 --> 01:12:07.000
You think this is good
wait till you try these.

01:12:09.954 --> 01:12:11.000
Let's see.

01:12:21.549 --> 01:12:23.000
This is good.

01:12:27.514 --> 01:12:30.000
You've got five men without hardhats,
no load statement...

01:12:31.226 --> 01:12:33.000
...the bathroom doesn't meet
handicapped standards...

01:12:34.229 --> 01:12:37.000
...and I told your foreman
two weeks ago to build that ramp.

01:12:38.149 --> 01:12:43.000
-I'm going to have to shut you down.
-Would you excuse us for a minute?

01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:46.000
Stanley, Stanley, walk with me.

01:12:47.242 --> 01:12:50.000
You're putting 25 guys out of work?

01:12:55.792 --> 01:13:01.000
I mean it. You got one week.
Anything goes wrong, it's your ass.

01:13:01.297 --> 01:13:05.000
If anything else goes wrong,
I'll red-tag this place myself.

01:13:05.927 --> 01:13:07.000
Let's go to lunch.

01:13:14.644 --> 01:13:15.000
What happened?

01:13:16.896 --> 01:13:20.000
-Jimmy, get over here!
-We could take my car.

01:13:20.608 --> 01:13:23.000
-It was a sign.
-Of course.

01:13:23.653 --> 01:13:26.000
God was saying to quit
and stay with you.

01:13:26.614 --> 01:13:30.000
No, Mama, it was
a real sign, with neon.

01:13:31.870 --> 01:13:34.000
Then it was a miracle
nobody got hurt.

01:13:34.706 --> 01:13:38.000
-When does your husband come home?
-Tonight.

01:13:38.335 --> 01:13:41.000
-He doesn't sound very good.
-Oh, wait.

01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:45.000
Which candle am I lighting?
To keep the job or lose the job?

01:13:46.968 --> 01:13:48.000
To keep.

01:13:53.266 --> 01:13:56.000
I should have sent you to Tokyo.

01:13:56.436 --> 01:14:00.000
Judd, I can open Vegas
in three weeks.

01:14:04.194 --> 01:14:06.000
If you could pull that off...

01:14:07.300 --> 01:14:11.000
...I might have to
give you the Midtown Club.

01:14:13.745 --> 01:14:18.000
-You'd still give it to me?
-You're the best field man I've got.

01:14:18.375 --> 01:14:20.000
We break ground July 1 st.

01:14:21.544 --> 01:14:23.000
Jeff said it wasn't starting
until October.

01:14:24.172 --> 01:14:26.000
Want me to give it to someone else?

01:14:29.636 --> 01:14:33.000
It's just that the baby's
due in October.

01:14:33.848 --> 01:14:37.000
-And I promised-
-Is there a problem?

01:14:39.854 --> 01:14:41.000
There's no problem.

01:14:54.911 --> 01:14:58.000
Look what Petra and Antonio got us.
Isn't it cute?

01:15:04.796 --> 01:15:07.000
We have clubs in New York.

01:15:07.382 --> 01:15:11.000
We have clubs in Dallas, in Hawaii.
We have clubs everywhere.

01:15:12.220 --> 01:15:15.000
So with your help,
and yours, and yours...

01:15:15.473 --> 01:15:19.000
...this can be the most successful
club we've ever had.

01:15:51.510 --> 01:15:53.000
Honey, let him get the club opened.

01:15:54.637 --> 01:15:58.000
He's changed, Lanie.
I can't reach him.

01:15:59.559 --> 01:16:03.000
-Something happened in New York.
-He's got a lot on his mind.

01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:08.000
No, it's more than that.
He's in trouble, but won't tell me.

01:16:08.693 --> 01:16:12.000
-Think he wants out?
-I don't know.

01:17:11.423 --> 01:17:14.000
-I've worried about you.
-Me too.

01:17:14.384 --> 01:17:17.000
You shouldn't worry.
It's your big night.

01:17:19.973 --> 01:17:23.000
Now that the club's open,
we should talk-

01:17:23.685 --> 01:17:26.000
I am so proud of you, Alex.
This looks fantastic.

01:17:28.898 --> 01:17:33.000
-Why aren't you more excited?
-Well, it's been a little hectic.

01:17:34.112 --> 01:17:37.000
It's been a lot going on.

01:17:38.241 --> 01:17:39.000
You look great.

01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:42.000
I look fat.

01:17:44.831 --> 01:17:46.000
Feel this.

01:17:49.878 --> 01:17:52.000
The baby likes the music.

01:17:54.883 --> 01:17:58.000
There's a teeny little problem
in the kitchen.

01:17:59.950 --> 01:18:02.000
I'll see you?
See you.

01:18:08.630 --> 01:18:10.000
You and Jeff seem
to be getting along.

01:18:11.660 --> 01:18:14.000
I hate talking to men
prettier than I am.

01:18:14.402 --> 01:18:15.000
Right.

01:18:16.905 --> 01:18:18.000
You okay?

01:18:18.490 --> 01:18:22.000
-This baby seems to be mad at me.
-Here. Come on, sit down.

01:18:23.244 --> 01:18:24.000
Let's go.
Excuse me.

01:18:25.288 --> 01:18:27.000
-I'll get Alex.
-No, you won't.

01:18:27.999 --> 01:18:32.000
-Just wait a minute. It'll pass.
-I'll get you some water.

01:18:55.944 --> 01:18:57.000
There you are.

01:18:58.655 --> 01:19:03.000
Judd, this is my wife, Isabel.
This is my boss, Judd Marshall.

01:19:04.285 --> 01:19:07.000
Nice to meet you.
It's a pleasure.

01:19:08.248 --> 01:19:09.000
Nice to meet you.

01:19:09.916 --> 01:19:12.000
You're in for an adventure.

01:19:12.961 --> 01:19:14.000
It has been so far.

01:19:14.963 --> 01:19:18.000
I knew if I dangled the Midtown Club
before Alex he'd get on track.

01:19:19.134 --> 01:19:21.000
-We don't need to talk-
-Excuse me?

01:19:21.594 --> 01:19:26.000
By this time next week
you'll both be New Yorkers.

01:19:26.975 --> 01:19:29.000
Great work,
but I must get out of here.

01:19:29.644 --> 01:19:33.000
Nightclubs give me a headache.
See you next week for dinner.

01:19:34.190 --> 01:19:35.000
Nice meeting you.

01:19:35.734 --> 01:19:36.000
I'll walk you out.

01:19:45.410 --> 01:19:48.000
There was nothing I could do.
It starts July 1 st.

01:19:48.913 --> 01:19:49.000
Have them wait.

01:19:50.123 --> 01:19:51.000
-I can't.
-Or won't?

01:19:52.125 --> 01:19:55.000
-I have worked too long to-
-To what?

01:19:55.295 --> 01:19:59.000
To share your life
with someone who loves you?

01:20:01.551 --> 01:20:07.000
-You have to be there, every day!
-Why've I been killing myself?

01:20:07.432 --> 01:20:11.000
You knew about this for a month,
but you don't include me.

01:20:11.519 --> 01:20:13.000
Why are you afraid of me?

01:20:14.230 --> 01:20:19.000
-Why do you alienate me?
-I don't, I don't know!

01:20:23.740 --> 01:20:25.000
I told you in the beginning...

01:20:26.284 --> 01:20:30.000
...I have no problem raising
this child on my own.

01:20:31.456 --> 01:20:35.000
-I thought we were a family!
-You don't understand the concept.

01:20:36.860 --> 01:20:40.000
To you it's something you put up with
on national holidays.

01:20:40.548 --> 01:20:42.000
Love, it's a gift, Alex.

01:20:43.426 --> 01:20:47.000
-Not an obligation.
-Look, this is the brass ring.

01:20:48.139 --> 01:20:50.000
I've worked my entire life
for this opportunity.

01:20:50.684 --> 01:20:54.000
I won't give it up
because I put a $5 ring...

01:20:54.354 --> 01:20:57.000
...on your finger in front of Elvis!

01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:18.000
Come here.

01:21:50.577 --> 01:21:51.000
Hello?

01:21:55.498 --> 01:21:56.000
What happened?

01:22:00.420 --> 01:22:02.000
-Maternity?
-Second floor.

01:22:09.554 --> 01:22:12.000
-Are you okay?
-I'm all right.

01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:19.000
Is the baby okay?

01:22:20.982 --> 01:22:22.000
There is no baby.

01:22:26.696 --> 01:22:28.000
What?

01:22:28.615 --> 01:22:33.000
If I hadn't been pregnant,
I wouldn't have gone to your house...

01:22:33.536 --> 01:22:36.000
...and we wouldn't have
gotten married.

01:22:36.706 --> 01:22:39.000
The baby was the reason
for us to be together.

01:22:41.127 --> 01:22:43.000
-Not true.
-I thought it was fate.

01:22:43.838 --> 01:22:46.000
But it was just a stupid,
superstitious dream.

01:22:47.258 --> 01:22:49.000
There are no signs, Alex.

01:22:50.470 --> 01:22:56.000
-We're different and always will be.
-So what are you saying?

01:22:56.476 --> 01:23:00.000
-We're not meant to be together.
-Don't do this. Not now.

01:23:01.106 --> 01:23:05.000
-Alex, this is not going to work.
-Let me help you!

01:23:06.611 --> 01:23:08.000
Get out, Alex.

01:23:11.157 --> 01:23:13.000
Get out!

01:23:15.453 --> 01:23:17.000
Get out!

01:26:57.676 --> 01:27:00.000
Now, come on,
don't be a putz.

01:27:00.428 --> 01:27:04.000
I can't believe you're turning down
seats to a Yankee game.

01:27:04.557 --> 01:27:07.000
-I have work to do.
-You are killing me.

01:27:07.686 --> 01:27:11.000
The girls come two to a bag.
You can't date one without the other.

01:27:11.356 --> 01:27:13.000
I am not up for it.
Okay, Jeff?

01:27:14.776 --> 01:27:17.000
Well, get up for it, okay, Alex?

01:27:17.529 --> 01:27:20.000
You know, this monk thing
is getting old.

01:27:21.740 --> 01:27:25.000
-Alex Whitman?
-That's me.

01:27:25.537 --> 01:27:28.000
Then this is for you.
Sign here.

01:27:30.500 --> 01:27:33.000
-What is this?
-Divorce papers.

01:27:33.837 --> 01:27:37.000
You have six days to contest.
Have a nice day.

01:27:38.133 --> 01:27:39.000
You too.

01:27:40.176 --> 01:27:43.000
There you go. Life sucks.
Welcome to the club.

01:27:44.140 --> 01:27:47.000
Now, about Friday.
Come with us.

01:27:53.732 --> 01:27:55.000
Nanita, it was the right thing to do.

01:27:56.260 --> 01:27:59.000
It is not your faith that has
betrayed you. It is your fear.

01:28:00.405 --> 01:28:02.000
I got lost... that's all.

01:28:02.741 --> 01:28:05.000
But now I make my own decisions.

01:28:05.744 --> 01:28:09.000
How selfish you are. To presume you
know better than love.

01:28:12.751 --> 01:28:17.000
He never would have left
if he knew I was still pregnant.

01:28:17.547 --> 01:28:20.000
He wanted to go.
I let him off the hook.

01:28:21.900 --> 01:28:22.000
No. You let yourself off the hook.

01:28:23.178 --> 01:28:26.000
You denied your heart and lied to the
man you love. Why?

01:28:38.234 --> 01:28:43.000
Because I had to. If I didn't leave
him, he would have left me.

01:28:45.909 --> 01:28:49.000
And I really don't think
I could've handled that.

01:28:54.793 --> 01:29:00.000
You will never know love
unless you surrender to it.

01:29:19.275 --> 01:29:24.000
-Whitman.
-It's Cathy. Is this a bad time?

01:29:24.447 --> 01:29:26.000
Cathy Stewart.

01:29:27.283 --> 01:29:32.000
-Your timing is impeccable.
-I heard about you and your wife...

01:29:32.580 --> 01:29:36.000
...and I wanted to tell you
how sorry I am.

01:29:37.961 --> 01:29:41.000
Okay, so listen. Your parents
are coming this weekend.

01:29:41.965 --> 01:29:45.000
Is there any chance
you couldjoin us?

01:29:47.595 --> 01:29:49.000
-Hello?
-You know what?

01:29:52.225 --> 01:29:53.000
You've got a date.

01:30:13.997 --> 01:30:15.000
There are signs everywhere.

01:30:26.301 --> 01:30:29.000
-What did you say?
-You look lost.

01:30:29.637 --> 01:30:33.000
There are signs everywhere
to help you find your way.

01:31:18.436 --> 01:31:20.000
South Street heliport.

01:32:16.661 --> 01:32:17.000
There you are.

01:32:21.166 --> 01:32:22.000
Hi, darling.

01:32:23.626 --> 01:32:25.000
Isn't this fun?

01:32:26.870 --> 01:32:30.000
I was telling Diane I can't remember
the last time we got together.

01:32:31.968 --> 01:32:35.000
Hear you've been doing
great things with that club.

01:32:38.892 --> 01:32:42.000
-Wait till you see Bruce's new boat.
-A weekend toy.

01:32:43.188 --> 01:32:46.000
-Let's get this show on the road.
-Let's go.

01:32:48.651 --> 01:32:50.000
A perfect weekend.

01:32:55.658 --> 01:32:59.000
-Are you all right?
-Yes, I am.

01:33:00.538 --> 01:33:03.000
I just have a thing
about helicopters.

01:33:04.834 --> 01:33:07.000
Well, you just stick by me then.

01:33:09.214 --> 01:33:10.000
Here, let me...

01:33:12.509 --> 01:33:13.000
Thank you.

01:33:26.106 --> 01:33:28.000
Isabel!
Come back inside!

01:35:11.544 --> 01:35:12.000
Tamazula?

01:35:15.340 --> 01:35:16.000
How do I get there?

01:35:30.105 --> 01:35:31.000
What the hell's a "tranvia"?

01:35:32.273 --> 01:35:34.000
That bus over there.

01:36:25.785 --> 01:36:30.000
No, she's not here. She went home to
give birth to your baby.

01:36:31.541 --> 01:36:33.000
I don't understand that.

01:36:34.252 --> 01:36:35.000
To Las Vegas.

01:36:37.964 --> 01:36:39.000
You must be kidding.

01:36:39.716 --> 01:36:42.000
So you are Isabel's great love...

01:36:44.346 --> 01:36:46.000
...my dear sweet boy.

01:37:14.167 --> 01:37:15.000
Lanie, please.

01:37:15.919 --> 01:37:19.000
I'm probably flying over her now.
When did she call?

01:37:19.714 --> 01:37:23.000
A few hours ago. She was in Nogales,
so she'll be here at 8.

01:37:23.968 --> 01:37:25.000
Why? What'll you do?

01:38:38.877 --> 01:38:40.000
What, are you nuts?

01:38:42.797 --> 01:38:44.000
Get off the road!

01:38:44.591 --> 01:38:48.000
What the hell!
Are you trying to get us killed?

01:38:49.554 --> 01:38:51.000
I'm not giving you a divorce!

01:38:52.724 --> 01:38:55.000
-You're too late.
-No, I still got till 12.

01:38:58.188 --> 01:39:01.000
-It's over!
-Get the hell off the road!

01:39:01.983 --> 01:39:05.000
There was a priest!
He said there were signs!

01:39:05.779 --> 01:39:06.000
What priest?

01:39:07.155 --> 01:39:10.000
By the hot dogs! You add
the Chihuahua, the Grand Canyon...

01:39:11.117 --> 01:39:15.000
...the child named Isabel.
There were signs everywhere!

01:39:16.289 --> 01:39:19.000
-I don't believe in signs, anymore.
-You do.

01:39:20.210 --> 01:39:22.000
Yes, you do!
And you were wrong.

01:39:22.754 --> 01:39:26.000
The baby didn't bring us together.
It was something bigger!

01:39:26.466 --> 01:39:32.000
-I just didn't believe in it till now.
-Don't do this.

01:39:34.641 --> 01:39:38.000
I love you.
I love you so much it hurts.

01:39:39.979 --> 01:39:42.000
What's going on
with your stomach?!

01:39:42.524 --> 01:39:45.000
-Oh, Alex, just go home!
-You're still pregnant!

01:39:46.611 --> 01:39:49.000
-You're still pregnant!
-I know!

01:39:49.489 --> 01:39:53.000
-How could you lie to me?
-I was afraid, all right?

01:39:54.350 --> 01:39:58.000
I tried to reach you, but I-
You lied to me, so I lied to you!

01:39:59.207 --> 01:40:00.000
I know, I know.

01:40:00.917 --> 01:40:04.000
But I was wrong and I'm sorry.
I'm here now.

01:40:05.213 --> 01:40:08.000
Don't you know what this means?
We have a baby!

01:40:08.883 --> 01:40:13.000
No. I'm having a baby.
You call 911.

01:40:13.847 --> 01:40:17.000
-Why?
-Because my water just broke.

01:40:19.436 --> 01:40:21.000
But we're on a dam!

01:40:31.823 --> 01:40:35.000
Excuse me. The ambulance
should be here in 10 minutes.

01:40:35.910 --> 01:40:37.000
Is this your wife?

01:40:38.413 --> 01:40:40.000
Can we move you
to the main building?

01:40:40.832 --> 01:40:42.000
The contractions are
on top of each other.

01:40:43.251 --> 01:40:45.000
The contractions are
on top of each other!

01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:48.000
I'm not deaf, I'm in labour!

01:40:49.632 --> 01:40:53.000
-We're having a baby!
-I hate you! I hate you!

01:40:53.428 --> 01:40:55.000
-I hate you!
-They always say that.

01:40:56.598 --> 01:40:59.000
You can do this.
You're the bravest person I know.

01:41:03.563 --> 01:41:07.000
-What'd she say?
-She loves me. Can't live without me.

01:41:07.567 --> 01:41:11.000
Looks like we're going to have
this baby right here, right now.

01:41:12.280 --> 01:41:13.000
Give her some air!

01:41:14.741 --> 01:41:19.000
-The baby's coming. But I'm here.
-Go away. You're bad luck.

01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:25.000
-I'm never leaving again.
-Get away from me!

01:41:26.252 --> 01:41:31.000
Oh, baby, don't go, please.
I'm so sorry for everything.

01:41:31.508 --> 01:41:33.000
I need you so much.

01:41:33.510 --> 01:41:35.000
I love you. I love you.

01:41:36.540 --> 01:41:38.000
You're breaking my hand!

01:41:38.556 --> 01:41:40.000
I need you to start pushing.

01:41:41.476 --> 01:41:44.000
There's a blanket in my car.
It's for the baby.

01:41:45.188 --> 01:41:47.000
-I'll get it.
-Push, push.

01:41:50.443 --> 01:41:55.000
-Oh, please, say anything.
-I rode a mule.

01:41:55.365 --> 01:41:59.000
-No wonder you stink.
-Your great-grandmother kissed me.

01:42:00.704 --> 01:42:03.000
You went to Aguascalientes?

01:42:05.333 --> 01:42:06.000
The blanket.

01:42:07.669 --> 01:42:11.000
-The head's out.
-Okay, breathe. This is it.

01:42:12.215 --> 01:42:13.000
Breathe!

01:42:16.678 --> 01:42:18.000
One more big push.

01:42:32.777 --> 01:42:37.000
-It's a girl!
-She's so beautiful.

01:42:39.284 --> 01:42:41.000
Oh, baby.

01:43:42.597 --> 01:43:47.000
-That was a little superstitious.
-I don't want to tempt fate.

01:43:58.113 --> 01:44:04.000
-Think she'll like living in New York?
-Not as much as camping in the desert.

01:44:06.204 --> 01:44:09.000
With a few Gray's Papaya hot dogs.

01:44:15.880 --> 01:44:16.000
Oh, no.

01:44:17.173 --> 01:44:19.000
-What?
-We're divorced.
