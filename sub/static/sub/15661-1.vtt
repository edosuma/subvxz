00:43.680 --> 00:44.966
Come on. This way.

01:08.520 --> 01:09.851
Go, go!

02:02.680 --> 02:03.727
Fuck!

02:29.480 --> 02:32.723
Got you! There's nowhere to run!

03:09.440 --> 03:12.125
Welcome, everybody,
to tonight's weighing in!

03:13.680 --> 03:18.527
First up onto the scales,
we have Wes "The Jailor" Baylor!

03:29.040 --> 03:30.610
170! Whoo!

03:35.960 --> 03:38.645
And his opponent, of course,
we cannot forget his opponent.

03:38.720 --> 03:40.324
For he cannot fight this fight
alone in the ring.

03:40.400 --> 03:41.447
Here we go, baby.

03:41.560 --> 03:45.360
- We have Jonny "Solid Gold" Sutherland!
- I'm proud of you.

03:52.240 --> 03:53.526
168.

04:00.800 --> 04:02.290
I'll see you in the ring, motherfucker.

04:02.360 --> 04:04.840
Get ready, 'cause I'm not playing.

04:07.160 --> 04:09.401
I will see you tomorrow night!

04:12.720 --> 04:13.960
Mmm.

04:22.160 --> 04:24.003
What a night.
I've been waiting for this night.

04:24.080 --> 04:25.161
Tension is so high.

04:25.240 --> 04:28.406
You know, Baylor is out to get Sutherland,
and Sutherland is out to get Baylor.

04:28.520 --> 04:30.124
It's just a matter of who wants it more,

04:30.200 --> 04:32.168
Baylor or Sutherland. That's it.

04:34.840 --> 04:36.365
Come on, use that jab!

04:38.360 --> 04:40.931
Oh, Sutherland gives a good first kick.
Couple of kicks.

04:41.040 --> 04:42.565
Baylor comes back.

04:43.600 --> 04:46.365
He punches, he kicks... Knees!

04:47.320 --> 04:51.325
This is crazy. Yeah. This is starting
faster than I thought it would.

04:53.040 --> 04:55.771
To the legs, to the legs,
and Baylor's on the floor!

04:55.840 --> 04:57.205
Baylor's on the floor.

04:57.640 --> 04:58.687
Sink it, sink it!

04:58.760 --> 04:59.761
Oh, Baylor...

05:00.040 --> 05:02.008
Baylor's got Sutherland in a headlock.

05:02.080 --> 05:03.286
And the first round is over.

05:03.720 --> 05:05.484
Go back to your corners.

05:08.400 --> 05:10.164
That was charged with energy, folks.

05:10.240 --> 05:11.890
That was insane. That was crazy.

05:15.080 --> 05:16.320
Here's some water. Come on.

05:22.360 --> 05:24.931
All right, folks, here we go.
Round two, round two.

05:34.840 --> 05:35.966
Move!

05:36.480 --> 05:37.925
Get in his head.

05:38.240 --> 05:39.730
- Move!
- Come on, Jonny!

05:39.800 --> 05:41.040
Come on, move!

05:47.240 --> 05:48.287
Move!

05:48.480 --> 05:49.891
He'll try to struggle out of it.

05:49.960 --> 05:53.521
Oh, and Baylor frees himself,
clenches, just missed Sutherland.

05:53.600 --> 05:56.809
Look at these longtime
sparring partners go at each other.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.331
Stay on him!

06:04.520 --> 06:08.206
Oh, my God! A roundhouse to Baylor's face!

06:16.120 --> 06:17.121
Come on.

06:17.400 --> 06:18.970
Back it up. Give him some room.

06:19.600 --> 06:20.726
Get up.

06:23.160 --> 06:24.685
In your corner.

06:32.920 --> 06:34.206
Yeah, baby!

06:39.360 --> 06:41.931
Don't know about the first,
but you definitely lost the second.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.571
You can't leave it up to the judges, okay?

06:44.640 --> 06:47.689
Remember out there, keep the jab.
Keep the jab always.

06:48.280 --> 06:50.760
Get out there and do your bloody business!

06:50.840 --> 06:53.081
Tell me what I gotta do, man.
Just tell me what I gotta do!

06:53.160 --> 06:55.367
You gotta knock him out.
You gotta take his head off.

06:55.440 --> 06:58.569
Now, get in there!
Come on! Pull it together!

07:00.600 --> 07:01.647
Go!

07:03.080 --> 07:04.206
Come on, Wes!

07:05.760 --> 07:07.524
Hey, hands up! Hands up!

07:30.480 --> 07:32.289
Finish him, Wes! Finish him!

07:39.560 --> 07:41.164
Put him away, Wes. Put him away!

07:43.680 --> 07:46.126
And Sutherland is down!

07:47.240 --> 07:48.571
Yes, yes!

07:50.320 --> 07:51.560
Come on, Wes!

08:27.160 --> 08:30.130
Oh, my God! And Sutherland is down!

08:46.520 --> 08:49.683
Oh, my God. He's still down.
Sutherland is still down.

08:52.120 --> 08:53.360
And he's not even moving.

08:53.440 --> 08:56.125
Oh, my God. Somebody help Sutherland!
Somebody go up...

09:05.800 --> 09:08.280
Wes, help him!

09:35.160 --> 09:37.083
Jonny!

10:04.360 --> 10:07.887
Jonny!

10:16.720 --> 10:18.051
I just want you to know,

10:18.120 --> 10:21.920
no matter how this turns out,
win or lose, you're family, all right?

10:23.200 --> 10:24.850
You're always gonna be welcome
out at the beach house.

10:27.720 --> 10:29.210
What beach house?

10:29.560 --> 10:32.848
The one I'm gonna buy with the money
I get from kicking your ass.

10:34.680 --> 10:36.011
What if I kick your ass?

10:36.080 --> 10:37.570
Well, then you can buy me the beach house.

10:43.640 --> 10:46.883
This is to remind you of all the time
we spent training for this,

10:47.000 --> 10:50.049
and how it paid off. Jonny.

11:22.360 --> 11:25.762
I really don't know how best friends
can do this to each other.

11:25.840 --> 11:27.444
Kay, don't worry about it.

11:27.520 --> 11:30.364
We kick the shit out of each other
in the gym on a daily basis.

11:30.440 --> 11:32.681
The only difference here?
We're gonna get paid for it.

11:32.760 --> 11:36.970
Wes, Jonny didn't make it. He's dead.

12:35.480 --> 12:37.164
Are you guys ready?

12:41.560 --> 12:44.848
I said, are you guys ready?

12:47.440 --> 12:48.680
Fight!

15:00.160 --> 15:02.731
- Hey. Good to see you.
- You, too.

15:02.800 --> 15:04.564
You having a good night?

15:04.640 --> 15:08.964
Hey, good to see you. Welcome.
I should put you in that fight.

16:54.640 --> 16:56.961
You just won me 3,000 bucks.

16:57.480 --> 16:58.606
Already got paid.

16:59.920 --> 17:01.410
Not enough for this shit.

17:03.720 --> 17:05.722
I'm Jonah Aldrich.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.924
I come from a family of fight promoters.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.047
Never heard of you.

17:11.119 --> 17:14.886
I'm not on the MMA circuit,
and neither are you these days.

17:16.520 --> 17:18.284
Look.

17:18.359 --> 17:22.001
For what it's worth,
I think it sucks how they treated you.

17:22.960 --> 17:25.486
After Sutherland,
you deserved a title shot.

17:25.560 --> 17:26.891
Wasn't your fault what happened,

17:26.960 --> 17:28.849
yet here you are,
risking your neck for chump change.

17:28.920 --> 17:30.684
It's just not right.

17:32.280 --> 17:34.169
Listen, uh, Mister...

17:34.280 --> 17:35.725
- Aldrich.
- Aldrich.

17:36.320 --> 17:39.244
I didn't just get the shit kicked out
of me by Bruce Lee over there,

17:39.320 --> 17:41.766
so that you could bullshit me to death.

17:41.840 --> 17:42.921
Want to tell me what it is you want?

17:43.040 --> 17:44.724
I want to give you a second chance.

17:44.800 --> 17:46.290
You want to give me a second chance?

17:46.360 --> 17:48.442
Yeah, I do.

17:50.320 --> 17:52.448
I'm putting together something special.

17:53.920 --> 17:55.524
A one-off fight in Myanmar.

17:56.800 --> 17:59.326
Winner takes home half a million.

18:01.280 --> 18:03.442
Not interested.

18:03.560 --> 18:04.607
Really?

18:06.760 --> 18:09.445
And how long is it before
some lunatic comes along

18:09.520 --> 18:11.170
and just caves your head in, huh?

18:11.240 --> 18:14.483
And for what?
A hundred bucks and a shot of tequila.

18:14.560 --> 18:18.610
Actually, it's 400
and two shots of tequila.

18:18.680 --> 18:19.727
One fight.

18:20.320 --> 18:24.211
One last payday, and you're set for life.

18:27.120 --> 18:30.124
Madden, give Mr. Baylor our particulars.

19:09.200 --> 19:11.521
You're always gonna be welcome
out at the beach house.

19:12.240 --> 19:13.571
What beach house?

19:13.640 --> 19:16.564
The one I'm gonna buy with the money
I get from kicking your ass.

19:16.640 --> 19:17.971
What if I kick your ass?

19:18.040 --> 19:20.088
Well, then you can buy me the beach house.

20:03.200 --> 20:06.090
Best view in Bangkok. Have a seat.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.365
You hungry?

20:10.840 --> 20:14.003
So, are you a fight promoter or a chef?

20:15.000 --> 20:17.970
Sushi requires precision.

20:19.440 --> 20:23.650
It helps me to focus.
Which helps me to relax.

20:24.960 --> 20:27.281
Are you calm and focused, Mr. Baylor?

20:27.560 --> 20:29.927
Because, given your history,

20:30.280 --> 20:32.408
killing your best friend
would destroy most men.

20:32.480 --> 20:34.926
Bury them in guilt and regret.

20:36.520 --> 20:38.966
Man might even try to
get himself killed in the ring

20:39.040 --> 20:42.522
as some sort of sad, pathetic penance.

20:44.160 --> 20:46.845
Are you that kind of a man, Mr. Baylor?

20:52.320 --> 20:53.845
I want one million.

20:57.680 --> 20:59.409
No bullshit gate percentages,

20:59.840 --> 21:02.844
no win-bonuses,
and I want the cash up front.

21:04.720 --> 21:07.007
You like to win, Mr. Baylor?

21:08.360 --> 21:10.806
Sure. Don't you?

21:12.400 --> 21:14.607
Abso-fucking-lutely.

21:36.720 --> 21:40.486
Welcome to the Republic of the Union
of Myanmar, Mr. Baylor.

22:42.960 --> 22:44.200
General.

22:46.480 --> 22:48.130
Good to see you.

22:52.800 --> 22:57.521
The Republic of the Union of Myanmar
gratefully accepts your donations.

22:58.880 --> 23:01.850
No worries.
We're just here to help the people.

23:06.480 --> 23:08.005
Come and meet the gang.

23:09.120 --> 23:13.250
Señor Esparto,
Spain's most celebrated bullfighter.

23:13.320 --> 23:15.687
Killed as much meat as a slaughterhouse.

23:15.760 --> 23:19.242
It will be an honor to see you
in the arena, Mr. Baylor.

23:23.360 --> 23:28.764
The Zimlings from Texas.
Jacob and his son, Tobias.

23:28.840 --> 23:31.411
Here for some father-son bonding.

23:31.480 --> 23:34.643
You're lucky, kid. My dad only
took me to Chuck E. Cheese.

23:34.720 --> 23:39.681
Holy shit.
You're Wes Baylor. The Executioner.

23:40.160 --> 23:42.162
Sorry, my ring name was The Jailor.

23:42.560 --> 23:45.882
Not after that last fight.
My boy and I were there.

23:45.960 --> 23:48.440
Fuckin' A, let me shake your hand.

23:49.680 --> 23:52.081
We're big fans.

23:53.080 --> 23:55.890
Like I promised, Mr. Zimling.
Only the best.

23:55.960 --> 23:59.521
Miss Sofia, heir to the third-richest
oil baron in the world.

23:59.600 --> 24:04.208
Taking Daddy's lifelong hobby
of big game hunting to the next level.

24:04.280 --> 24:05.884
Bit of a sore subject.

24:13.040 --> 24:15.281
They tell me you like punishment.

24:16.680 --> 24:19.160
Sorry, ma'am. You're not my type.

24:23.680 --> 24:25.250
That's bullshit.

24:25.720 --> 24:27.484
I'm everyone's type.

24:30.160 --> 24:31.764
Landon Marshall.

24:32.160 --> 24:35.289
You probably recognize
the face from Wired magazine.

24:35.360 --> 24:38.091
They called me the Mark Zuckerberg
of the first-person shooter.

24:38.160 --> 24:39.605
I've never heard of you.

24:41.040 --> 24:42.201
Never heard of you either, bro.

24:42.320 --> 24:44.721
- Where's Maduka?
- Probably sleeping off last night.

24:44.800 --> 24:46.165
Very well. Let's begin.

24:46.240 --> 24:47.571
Begin what?

24:47.640 --> 24:49.642
What exactly is going on here?

24:49.720 --> 24:52.963
Where's the ring?
Where's... Where's the opponent?

24:53.800 --> 25:00.331
Your opponents you've met, and the ring,
well, you're standing in it.

25:00.400 --> 25:03.290
A hundred square miles of jungle.

25:03.360 --> 25:05.124
The purse?

25:05.200 --> 25:07.726
A million dollars' worth of rubies.

25:08.840 --> 25:10.808
You get across the border, they're yours.

25:10.880 --> 25:13.087
Thailand's that way. Due east.

25:21.360 --> 25:24.489
What is this? Some sort of a joke?

25:24.560 --> 25:26.005
Is there a hidden camera
around here, or...

25:26.080 --> 25:28.321
You signed up for
a no-holds-barred contest,

25:28.400 --> 25:31.085
and that's exactly
what you're going to get.

25:33.680 --> 25:36.206
That's what you're all going to get.

25:36.280 --> 25:39.045
Time to find out where
you are on the food chain.

25:40.920 --> 25:42.490
Choose your weapon!

25:43.720 --> 25:44.960
Hey.

25:51.320 --> 25:55.006
I recommend the crossbow
for the real hunter.

25:55.800 --> 25:57.564
- And don't worry.
- Hey.

25:57.640 --> 25:59.722
Change your mind later,
there'll be plenty of time.

25:59.800 --> 26:00.847
They'll be following us.

26:04.080 --> 26:05.366
It's all yours.

26:14.480 --> 26:15.811
Yes, sir.

26:30.880 --> 26:33.167
A little demonstration of what lies ahead.

26:48.520 --> 26:50.522
That is just a start.

26:53.200 --> 26:55.487
You're facing the ultimate challenge.

26:55.640 --> 27:00.521
Hunting your equal
on the evolutionary scale.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.571
You rise to this challenge,

27:05.720 --> 27:09.167
you'll reach the pinnacle
of satisfaction as a hunter.

27:09.440 --> 27:11.044
Can I get a "Fuck, yeah"?

27:11.120 --> 27:13.407
Fuck, yeah!

27:20.680 --> 27:22.330
No weapon for you.

27:22.400 --> 27:25.290
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Baylor. Madden's right.

27:25.880 --> 27:27.882
But I will give you this.

27:28.280 --> 27:31.045
A two-minute head start.

27:32.480 --> 27:33.766
And a water bottle.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.729
Fill it when you can.

27:41.480 --> 27:44.211
What the hell is wrong with you people?

27:46.080 --> 27:49.687
This isn't a fight. That's murder.

27:49.760 --> 27:51.364
No, it's a hunt.

27:51.720 --> 27:53.529
It's fucking insane.

27:53.600 --> 27:55.090
Ninety seconds.

27:56.800 --> 28:00.771
This is bullshit, Aldrich.
I didn't sign up for this shit.

28:02.960 --> 28:05.406
Find yourself another piece of meat.
I'm out of here.

28:07.360 --> 28:08.850
You're right about that.

28:08.920 --> 28:14.131
One way or the other, you are out of here.
It's up to you to choose.

28:15.680 --> 28:16.886
Not a lot of choice here.

28:16.960 --> 28:18.007
Course there is.

28:18.080 --> 28:22.004
You can win, or you can lose.

28:22.560 --> 28:23.561
Oh.

28:24.280 --> 28:25.805
Seventy seconds.

28:30.040 --> 28:31.405
What's the matter?

28:31.520 --> 28:34.808
You need me to ring the bell? Ding-ding.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.525
This will be a good hunt.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.526
Mr. Maduka. So glad you could make it.

29:29.680 --> 29:31.409
Chief Lord Maduka.

29:32.040 --> 29:35.726
My apologies. Chief Lord.

29:36.760 --> 29:39.969
But cameras, cell phones,
any recording devices.

29:40.600 --> 29:41.965
You know the rules.

29:42.560 --> 29:44.801
No calls, just a few snaps?

29:44.880 --> 29:46.803
Take a mental picture, Mr. Marshall.

29:46.880 --> 29:49.087
You're about to join
a very exclusive club.

29:49.160 --> 29:51.288
We don't just share this with anyone.

29:51.360 --> 29:55.126
Besides, what you're about to experience
can't be captured on camera.

29:55.200 --> 29:58.283
You're gonna let it live in here forever.

29:58.400 --> 30:00.050
Jesus, ladies.

30:00.120 --> 30:01.884
You want to fuck or hunt?

30:02.560 --> 30:04.562
Let's go!

30:22.240 --> 30:23.401
Get him!

30:37.520 --> 30:39.887
Damn, you are in great shape.

30:41.360 --> 30:44.250
You CrossFit? Spinning?

30:45.000 --> 30:47.082
Krav Maga? That's my jam.

30:48.360 --> 30:50.601
Excuse me while I get my heart rate up.

30:53.600 --> 30:55.762
The pressure getting to you, kid?

30:56.280 --> 30:58.282
Why don't you shut the fuck up, old man?

31:14.200 --> 31:16.168
A hundred miles due east, huh?

31:16.240 --> 31:17.401
Fuck you, Aldrich.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.525
North border's only 40.

31:25.440 --> 31:27.920
He's run flat out for a mile,
knows we're right behind him.

31:28.640 --> 31:31.007
Probably doesn't like
his chances out in the open.

31:32.720 --> 31:34.643
Try to get in his head.

31:42.440 --> 31:43.646
Clever lad.

32:26.240 --> 32:27.446
Who's missing?

32:27.520 --> 32:28.681
Maduka.

32:36.720 --> 32:37.846
Shit.

32:51.040 --> 32:52.121
Fuck!

33:32.640 --> 33:33.926
Please, please! Please stop!

33:38.160 --> 33:39.241
Seriously?

33:42.800 --> 33:44.689
You like my little toy, huh?

33:44.760 --> 33:47.684
I make it special for monkeys like you.

34:38.880 --> 34:41.485
When we step into the arena,

34:42.760 --> 34:44.762
we don't always step out.

34:45.840 --> 34:47.763
Not so noble now, Chief Lord.

34:47.840 --> 34:50.446
They're called hard targets for a reason.

34:50.520 --> 34:51.931
Jesus.

34:52.280 --> 34:56.001
For the first time you're hunting
something as smart as you are.

34:56.320 --> 34:57.731
Doubt that.

34:57.800 --> 34:59.564
Baylor won't be an easy kill.

34:59.640 --> 35:00.971
As it should be.

35:01.400 --> 35:04.609
Lady and gentlemen, all bets are off.

35:04.680 --> 35:06.728
From now on, watch your backs.

35:07.360 --> 35:11.448
And I guarantee one of you will be wearing
his balls for breakfast by sundown.

35:16.880 --> 35:18.882
Wipe your goddamn mouth.

35:39.600 --> 35:40.681
This way!

35:43.640 --> 35:45.563
Stay alert. He's close.

35:56.720 --> 35:57.846
Shit.

36:03.440 --> 36:05.249
Target's in sight!

36:10.480 --> 36:12.369
We have the high ground!

36:14.640 --> 36:17.246
Man has hunted every
species on the planet.

36:17.760 --> 36:19.922
What makes you better than him, huh?

36:20.040 --> 36:21.769
It is time to find out!

36:37.440 --> 36:39.283
Fuck this bow-and-arrow shit.

36:40.240 --> 36:42.607
Like shootin' fish in a barrel, Baylor!

36:53.640 --> 36:54.880
Try this!

36:56.920 --> 36:58.365
Now you're talking.

37:00.120 --> 37:01.645
It's Christmas!

37:14.760 --> 37:18.003
Come on, let's go. Let's go. Fuck!

37:44.800 --> 37:46.802
You want to fight these elephants?

37:49.280 --> 37:50.930
He threw the first punch.

37:51.000 --> 37:54.846
You fell in their bath and scared them.
I saw the whole thing.

37:56.680 --> 37:58.205
You working for Aldrich?

37:58.720 --> 38:00.210
Who's Aldrich?

38:03.280 --> 38:04.486
Forget about it.

38:06.040 --> 38:07.326
Shit!

38:08.880 --> 38:11.724
Hey, you see a watch around here anywhere?

38:21.840 --> 38:23.046
Here you go.

38:26.280 --> 38:27.486
Thanks.

38:29.240 --> 38:31.208
What are you doing out here?

38:31.840 --> 38:33.922
Some people are hunting me.

38:35.840 --> 38:38.161
My brother was being hunted, too.

38:38.240 --> 38:39.366
Win.

38:40.520 --> 38:42.090
Have you seen him?

38:43.080 --> 38:44.320
No.

38:46.080 --> 38:47.411
I'm sorry.

38:49.680 --> 38:51.284
I have to get to the border.

38:55.600 --> 38:57.329
The border's not that way.

38:58.760 --> 39:00.250
Just follow me.

39:10.920 --> 39:13.526
Baylor is good. I'll give him that.

39:13.600 --> 39:16.126
Yeah. Maybe too good.

39:16.200 --> 39:19.522
Hey, perhaps we could
take a short break, huh?

39:19.600 --> 39:22.604
Fuck that. I'll kill him myself.

39:24.280 --> 39:27.682
I realize you didn't pay
good money to run a jungle 5K.

39:27.800 --> 39:29.484
You're here to hunt.

39:29.560 --> 39:33.451
But even good hunters
need their trusted steeds!

39:40.000 --> 39:43.527
Hey! Now you're talking.

39:44.600 --> 39:45.840
Come on.

39:57.320 --> 39:59.448
How do you know where we're going?

39:59.520 --> 40:01.921
Everything looks the same to me.

40:02.240 --> 40:04.607
My brother and I grew up here.

40:05.160 --> 40:08.004
That's how we got involved in all of this.

40:08.840 --> 40:10.524
Got involved in what?

40:11.160 --> 40:13.731
They told him he was doing a drug run.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.889
Then he disappeared.

40:16.880 --> 40:21.607
When someone in our village disappears,
we know they're being used in a game.

40:21.960 --> 40:23.769
So how are you here?

40:24.760 --> 40:26.285
I'm a fighter.

40:26.760 --> 40:29.411
They told me there was gonna be a fight.

40:29.480 --> 40:31.562
Fight turned out to be a hunt.

40:34.440 --> 40:36.886
My brother's a good fighter, too.

40:37.440 --> 40:39.920
He fights for me and our village.

40:40.840 --> 40:44.606
Well, the best fighters always
have something to fight for.

40:46.840 --> 40:48.729
What is your something?

41:01.880 --> 41:04.042
I love it when they take the temple route.

41:04.600 --> 41:05.601
Where did he pick up the girl?

41:06.120 --> 41:07.565
I don't know.

41:07.880 --> 41:10.406
Let's see if we can charge extra for her.

41:14.240 --> 41:16.846
Tell the gang there's another target.

41:19.080 --> 41:20.570
Which way now?

41:20.840 --> 41:23.161
Through the old
temple grounds, over there.

41:23.240 --> 41:25.720
Then we follow the train tracks
and the river for a long time

41:25.800 --> 41:27.564
before we get to the border.

41:27.640 --> 41:28.721
Okay.

41:28.840 --> 41:33.164
Train tracks, river, all the way to
the border. Thank you. Sorry, I...

41:33.920 --> 41:35.365
I didn't get your name.

41:35.440 --> 41:36.441
Tha.

41:37.080 --> 41:38.650
Tha? I'm Wes.

41:42.880 --> 41:44.848
All right, cool. Thank you.

41:44.920 --> 41:48.284
Thank you very much for your help,
and good luck finding your brother.

41:48.400 --> 41:50.448
I'm gonna make my own way now.

41:54.360 --> 41:55.441
Tha, listen.

41:55.520 --> 41:59.127
Your life is going to be a lot safer
without me in it. Trust me.

42:43.760 --> 42:45.649
I'll lead them away. Hide!

45:06.280 --> 45:09.489
I saw the girl.
We'll have to go on foot to get her.

45:11.440 --> 45:13.807
Hey. I love this.

45:15.880 --> 45:18.008
You think it's a good idea
to leave the bike?

45:18.800 --> 45:21.326
Shit. Dad.

45:28.160 --> 45:29.730
I can smell her.

45:40.640 --> 45:41.971
What are you doing?

45:42.040 --> 45:43.326
I saw someone.

45:45.160 --> 45:47.049
There's no one there.

45:47.120 --> 45:48.565
- Yeah.
- You fuckin' clown.

45:48.840 --> 45:50.763
Ow. You think I'm crazy?

45:50.840 --> 45:52.126
She's up ahead.

45:52.200 --> 45:54.123
I hate the fucking jungle!

46:02.360 --> 46:03.850
Little bitch.

46:08.440 --> 46:10.124
Won't be needing that anymore.

46:15.320 --> 46:17.527
You like the rough stuff, do you? So do I.

46:21.680 --> 46:24.763
Trouble is, you can
never get enough of it.

46:32.560 --> 46:34.961
I don't want anything to do with this.

46:35.360 --> 46:38.523
Tobias. Tobias!
Where the hell are you going?

46:38.600 --> 46:41.649
Get back here, you pussy! Tobias!

46:51.400 --> 46:54.051
Tobias! Tobias!

46:59.160 --> 47:01.242
What the hell is wrong with you, lady?

47:02.360 --> 47:06.081
There are infinite
privileges and side effects

47:06.160 --> 47:08.288
to being the only child

47:08.360 --> 47:12.482
of one of the greatest assholes
in the history of big game hunting.

47:23.600 --> 47:27.321
All the time and resources to train
your mind and body for combat.

47:45.280 --> 47:50.525
I just hoped that the day might come
that I get to hunt the hunter.

47:51.080 --> 47:53.845
Oh, so, that's what this is about.
Daddy issues, huh?

47:53.920 --> 47:57.163
Why don't you just get yourself
a sparring partner?

48:01.200 --> 48:04.170
Because it doesn't count
unless the hunt is real.

48:08.640 --> 48:10.608
That real enough for you?

48:36.680 --> 48:38.808
Not good, fuck! Not good.

48:38.880 --> 48:41.167
Not good. Not good.

48:48.800 --> 48:49.926
Tha!

48:50.920 --> 48:52.081
Tha!

48:53.960 --> 48:55.007
Tha!

48:56.360 --> 48:57.725
He's dead.

48:58.200 --> 48:59.884
Come on, let's go.

49:00.360 --> 49:01.646
Come on.

49:13.640 --> 49:14.926
Karma's a bitch.

49:17.800 --> 49:20.770
Cover him. This is not good for business.

49:27.720 --> 49:28.801
He's awake.

49:28.880 --> 49:30.484
- He's awake.
- No.

49:34.400 --> 49:35.686
What happened?

49:35.760 --> 49:36.966
I don't know.

49:37.040 --> 49:38.451
The woman.

49:39.560 --> 49:40.766
She did this.

49:42.120 --> 49:44.805
You let a girl do this to your father?

49:45.480 --> 49:47.005
How could you, huh?

49:49.240 --> 49:52.323
Your father spent a small fortune
so you could grow some balls,

49:52.400 --> 49:55.165
and that's exactly what you're
gonna do, right here, right now.

49:55.240 --> 49:56.605
You want to kill these people?

49:56.720 --> 49:57.721
No, no. I don't want to kill anyone.

49:57.800 --> 49:59.882
Say it.

49:59.960 --> 50:01.689
- I want to kill them.
- Louder.

50:01.760 --> 50:02.921
- I want to kill...
- Louder!

50:03.000 --> 50:04.240
I want to kill them!

50:04.320 --> 50:05.560
Like you mean it!

50:10.120 --> 50:11.360
I want to kill them.

50:15.520 --> 50:16.851
That's good.

50:18.760 --> 50:22.526
Hey, maybe...
Maybe we should head back, huh?

50:22.600 --> 50:24.250
Yeah, that's right.

50:24.320 --> 50:26.687
Why don't you run home to Mommy?

50:30.640 --> 50:32.802
We came here chasing death.

50:34.080 --> 50:36.560
We should not be surprised if we find it.

50:38.880 --> 50:40.530
You're wrong, sir.

50:41.160 --> 50:43.731
We did not come here to chase death.

50:48.560 --> 50:50.210
We came to deal it.

51:11.800 --> 51:13.370
Come on, we gotta keep moving.

51:13.440 --> 51:15.169
I didn't want to kill him.

51:15.640 --> 51:17.483
You didn't have a choice.

51:17.920 --> 51:21.481
No. We always have a choice.

51:23.680 --> 51:26.365
Look, you got two choices, all right?

51:27.680 --> 51:32.049
Either you fight,
or you stay here and you die.

51:33.720 --> 51:35.688
What's it gonna be?

51:42.760 --> 51:43.886
Good choice.

51:46.440 --> 51:47.851
You're hurt.

51:49.840 --> 51:52.286
- That needs to be treated.
- Yeah, with what?

51:52.360 --> 51:53.646
Let's go.

51:53.720 --> 51:55.245
I know a place.

51:57.760 --> 51:59.489
Ah, shit.

52:13.880 --> 52:15.644
Show me your wound.

52:29.880 --> 52:31.882
What are you going to do with your money?

52:35.160 --> 52:37.731
I'm gonna buy a big house by the sea.

52:39.200 --> 52:41.009
I'm trying to buy a whole village.

52:41.080 --> 52:42.081
Yeah?

52:45.200 --> 52:46.929
Did everybody leave?

52:47.800 --> 52:50.690
The soldiers told us they needed the land.

52:50.760 --> 52:53.969
But one of the soldiers
was from a nearby village.

52:54.040 --> 52:58.489
Told us that hunters had paid the General
to clear out this entire area.

53:00.160 --> 53:03.130
So, they moved us to a border town.
It's awful there.

53:03.920 --> 53:07.129
No way to make offerings
to the forest spirit.

53:07.920 --> 53:10.241
So, she's become very hungry.

53:10.920 --> 53:12.445
And very angry.

53:17.920 --> 53:21.288
Now that Y'wa is fed,
we will suffer no more.

53:22.120 --> 53:25.124
She'll return my brother
and village to me.

53:29.640 --> 53:30.641
Come.

53:31.800 --> 53:33.882
Show some respect.

54:24.880 --> 54:26.689
You got a position, yet?

54:26.960 --> 54:28.610
Two klicks over that ridge.

54:28.680 --> 54:30.250
Good. Get the kids.

54:30.840 --> 54:31.887
Team!

54:46.200 --> 54:49.124
Okay, great.
So, what, we follow the road now?

54:49.200 --> 54:51.771
No, we go through this field. See?

54:51.880 --> 54:55.521
Down the river and further down
is the bridge to the border.

54:55.600 --> 54:57.250
Come on, let's go.

54:58.040 --> 54:59.485
What's that smell?

54:59.560 --> 55:00.641
What?

55:00.720 --> 55:02.404
Smells like gasoline.

55:05.800 --> 55:07.006
Land mines.

55:07.080 --> 55:08.570
- What?
- Don't move!

55:09.480 --> 55:10.641
Shit.

55:17.200 --> 55:19.407
Grab a drink if you need one!

55:19.640 --> 55:20.926
Get down.

55:21.560 --> 55:23.085
They're here already?

55:25.240 --> 55:26.810
Get back there.

55:30.280 --> 55:31.520
Come on.

55:46.640 --> 55:48.130
That's right.

55:48.240 --> 55:49.924
Come on in, you bastards.

55:54.800 --> 55:55.961
There!

56:00.760 --> 56:02.444
Here we go.

56:11.400 --> 56:13.641
Stop! Everybody freeze!

56:16.160 --> 56:20.051
You've cornered your prey.
He's in the minefield, stuck, nowhere to go.

56:21.520 --> 56:22.646
Checkmate.

56:22.720 --> 56:26.964
All that remains is target practice.
Break out the M16s.

56:38.720 --> 56:40.563
- Hey, no, no, no! Tobias, wait!
- Die, motherfucker!

56:40.640 --> 56:41.880
Wait!

57:01.880 --> 57:03.006
Fuck!

57:04.560 --> 57:07.848
God damn it! Somebody kill this prick!

57:23.360 --> 57:25.044
You want to die?

57:26.320 --> 57:27.401
Get out of here.

57:27.560 --> 57:29.369
Leave me alone. Run!

57:32.080 --> 57:33.570
Pretty soon, they're
gonna find me, all right?

57:33.640 --> 57:36.211
And when they do, you shouldn't be here.

57:36.880 --> 57:38.086
Now, go!

57:39.000 --> 57:42.766
I'm not leaving.
I know a good hiding place.

57:56.960 --> 57:59.930
Wait, did you hear that?

58:00.680 --> 58:02.887
Someone else is here.

58:10.040 --> 58:11.166
Win?

58:11.720 --> 58:13.484
Win.

58:13.560 --> 58:14.766
Tha! Tha.

58:22.120 --> 58:23.610
Who are you?

58:25.240 --> 58:27.004
- What are you doing with him?
- No, it's okay.

58:27.080 --> 58:28.286
He's one of them!

58:28.400 --> 58:29.890
Take it easy, man. Take it easy.

58:29.960 --> 58:31.485
I'm not one of them, all right?

58:31.560 --> 58:32.971
I'm in the same position you are.

58:33.040 --> 58:37.090
It's okay, trust me.
We can trust him. Okay?

58:37.600 --> 58:39.090
Those guys are hunting me as well.

58:39.200 --> 58:40.611
Just trust me. It's okay.

58:40.680 --> 58:41.806
Okay.

58:42.960 --> 58:44.325
It's okay.

58:52.600 --> 58:53.931
This way.

59:09.960 --> 59:11.928
Tracks lead down here.

59:23.280 --> 59:24.281
What's wrong?

59:24.360 --> 59:25.486
I've lost the tracks.

59:25.560 --> 59:26.641
I lost the signal.

59:28.200 --> 59:29.326
Fuck.

59:30.560 --> 59:32.244
I'll handle this.

59:46.200 --> 59:48.601
Let's make camp here, everyone.

01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:06.250
Why do you care so much about that watch?

01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:08.209
A friend gave it to me.

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:10.723
Reminds me of something.

01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:12.370
Something good?

01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:16.205
Not really.

01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:20.008
Here. Let me take a look.

01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:30.847
Tomorrow, we cross the border.

01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:34.731
Then what?

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:40.243
Then I'll leave you.

01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:45.842
That's what you want, right?

01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:55.008
You should get some sleep.

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:03.090
Good night, Tha.

01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:11.050
Kind of burnt.

01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:14.720
What is this? Fucking summer camp?

01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:23.081
So, Aldrich, how'd you get into this
business, if you don't mind me asking?

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:29.286
CIA didn't have much appreciation
for my talents.

01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:32.330
Said I was too theatrical.

01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:35.604
Can you believe that?

01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:38.251
So, I came up with my own business.

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:39.890
Hunting with a twist.

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:43.649
Turned into international success.

01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:49.601
The General was escorting rebels
in the Yangon prison.

01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:53.681
I suggest he help us hunt.

01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:55.806
He bites.

01:01:57.120 --> 01:02:01.205
I mean, prisoners
are gonna die anyway, right?

01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:03.561
So, why not have some fun?

01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:07.565
They let them loose in the jungle,
we acted as trackers,

01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:09.927
grew the business from there.

01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:12.449
So, the money's good?

01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:14.006
Yeah.

01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:16.724
Killing's better.

01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:20.291
Didn't get your fill in the military, huh?

01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:22.882
I was never in the service.

01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:26.487
Didn't make the psych evaluation.

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:33.001
Pussies thought I was too crazy.

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:38.322
Well, they weren't wrong.

01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:46.721
No. No, no. No.

01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:48.806
Jonny.

01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:52.124
Jonny! No!

01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:53.407
Wes!

01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:56.361
Jonny!

01:02:57.280 --> 01:02:58.770
Be quiet!

01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:12.725
Who's Jonny?

01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:15.043
Jonny was my best friend.

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:20.484
We were both in line
for a shot at the title.

01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:25.726
They wanted us to fight each other.

01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:28.964
Offered us more money
than we'd ever known,

01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:32.525
so we did.

01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:35.561
I wanted to win.

01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:38.644
And I didn't want to leave it
in the hands of the judges,

01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:42.088
so I went for the knockout.

01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:46.880
I hit him so hard, he never woke up.

01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:49.450
It was an accident.

01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:54.366
You didn't mean for it to happen.

01:03:57.640 --> 01:03:59.563
But it still happened.

01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:33.007
Tha?

01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:41.961
Oh, shit.

01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:52.728
Nice to see you again, Win.

01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:56.327
How appropriate we caught you both
at this particular place.

01:04:57.280 --> 01:05:01.888
The Japanese killed nearly
100,000 workers building this railroad.

01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:05.130
Starvation,

01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:08.441
exhaustion, dysentery.

01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:13.245
Plenty of them got beaten to death.

01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:16.003
Where's Wes Baylor?

01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:17.491
I killed him.

01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:19.489
For the rubies.

01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:22.324
You killed him?

01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:29.448
No, he was asleep.

01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:32.284
I don't buy it.

01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:40.361
Please!

01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:44.126
Please.

01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:53.041
Please!

01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:57.806
Help!

01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:27.768
Shut up. Shut up.

01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:33.321
I didn't kill anybody.

01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:37.166
I'm just a shitty video game designer.
Please don't kill me.

01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:44.448
The Japanese killed nearly
100,000 workers building this railroad.

01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:47.963
Starvation. Exhaustion.

01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:55.404
- Move.
- Yeah.

01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:03.601
I saw a Burmese soldier do this.

01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:05.849
Just a length of bamboo.

01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:08.764
Took him only four shots
to get clean through the neck.

01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:10.569
I don't think you'll last two.

01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:11.926
Don't! Stop!

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.445
Don't do it!

01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:15.886
Stop it.

01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:17.200
Where's Baylor?

01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:20.647
Please! Stop it!

01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:22.726
Where's Baylor?

01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:24.040
No! Please!

01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:26.040
Aldrich!

01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:32.480
Let 'em go.

01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:35.404
What do you care about them?
They took your payday.

01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:36.641
Yeah, I'm taking it back.

01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:38.321
Cut 'em loose.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:44.686
Cut 'em loose and back up,
or I'll blow his fuckin' head off!

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.365
Let me take him.

01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:48.568
No. You'll only kill Marshall.

01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:49.801
So what?

01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:54.283
It's bad enough for business
losing clients to Baylor.

01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:57.569
It'd be a fucking catastrophe
if we start shooting them ourselves.

01:07:57.640 --> 01:07:59.244
Cut 'em loose.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.161
Give her the rubies.

01:08:27.479 --> 01:08:28.685
Wes.

01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:30.444
Save it. Get behind me.

01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:34.529
Now what, Baylor?

01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:38.202
Got you backed into a corner.
You got nowhere to go.

01:08:39.319 --> 01:08:41.890
Come on, dude. Game over.

01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:43.724
Please, just let me go.

01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:47.648
You and Win, go on, go.

01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:48.720
No.

01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:51.929
I'll hold 'em off, and then...
Then I'll jump.

01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:54.720
Go!

01:08:57.720 --> 01:08:58.960
Move!

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.569
Where's Baylor?

01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:23.170
I got this.

01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:24.241
Sorry.

01:09:26.279 --> 01:09:28.169
Meet me at the river.

01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:38.684
I will never tell you.

01:09:49.319 --> 01:09:50.890
Oh, I think you will.

01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:36.564
Wes, come here!

01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:51.407
Win!

01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:15.249
Ay.

01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:16.606
Not good.

01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:29.407
This guy is...

01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:34.846
Sorry about before.

01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:37.281
Don't do that again. It's crazy.

01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:41.131
The rubies.

01:12:56.280 --> 01:12:57.327
Found Sofia.

01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:03.486
Fuck.

01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:06.965
At least we know where they're going.

01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:24.242
They're called hard targets for a reason.

01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:29.282
First time you're hunting
something as smart as you are.

01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:31.090
Baylor won't be a...

01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:48.126
I don't blame you for being angry.

01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:51.011
When I save your ass, you rob me blind?

01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:52.686
We had no choice.

01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:54.683
We always have a choice.

01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:58.889
The rubies aren't for me.
They're for my village.

01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:04.010
If I pay the General, he'll let us
return home. They'll stop hunting us.

01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:06.567
That's why I took the rubies.

01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:10.522
How am I supposed to know
you're telling the truth?

01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:13.691
You can't.

01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:16.204
But you can choose to.

01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:24.405
You get me to the border,
we'll call it quits.

01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:38.290
Look, man. I'm not even a hunter.
I'm a gamer.

01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:40.601
Just give me back my phone.

01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:43.451
I'll call my assistant,
have someone pick me up.

01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:47.081
The memory card's missing.

01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:50.325
Where did this come from?

01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:54.321
I have no idea.
It must be that woman, or someone.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:57.240
Really?

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:03.040
A poor villager in bamboo flip-flops
can afford a $1,000 minicam?

01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:07.770
I told you, Mr. Marshall,

01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:12.687
no phones, no cameras.
No recording devices.

01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:14.888
Yeah, we cleared that up, remember?

01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:17.767
Like you said, I'm gonna carry it here,

01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:21.043
in my heart,
and my heart is full of the...

01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:22.730
- What did you film?
- I didn't film anything!

01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:25.770
No, stop! Okay, look.

01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:29.322
It was a few POV shots,
first-person-shooter stuff.

01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:30.721
Of us?

01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:32.166
You filmed us?

01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:34.408
I was stuck on my new game.

01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:37.524
The pressure to deliver is fucking insane.

01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:40.809
And the critics, man,
thirteen-year-olds are harsh.

01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:43.966
I just... I needed some new inspiration.

01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:46.566
Look, I know I screwed up,
I'm really sorry.

01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:50.690
Do you understand the concept
of a verbal contract?

01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:54.126
We can get that card back.
You guys are badasses.

01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:57.880
It's binding.

01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:00.811
And actionable.

01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:11.210
Congratulations, Señor Esparto.

01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:15.326
You're our last hunter.

01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:18.449
Let's bag that target. Signal's back.

01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:21.568
Let's see where they are.

01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:24.842
He's almost at the border.

01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:28.449
Wait. You had this all along?

01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:31.163
You're tracking with this?

01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:34.486
You have no honor.

01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:37.081
- Ah, give me a break.
- Ah.

01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:40.721
Trying to contain a situation,
you dumb, spic bastard.

01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:46.926
Easy, amigo. Back off.

01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:49.290
Did something get lost in translation?

01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:52.967
Mr. Marshall brought in a recording device.
Baylor's got the footage.

01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:56.648
Footage that might not sit too well
with your fans back home, or Interpol.

01:16:56.720 --> 01:17:00.970
So, do you want honor,
or do you want Baylor?

01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:07.481
Nobody calls me a spic. I'm a dago.

01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:15.885
We can't let Baylor get to the border.

01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:18.409
Call in the cleanup crew.

01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:21.086
- You think we need them?
- Call them!

01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:04.485
Shit, we can't pass here.
Follow me. Ready? Come on.

01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:37.200
Stay low.

01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:50.487
How the hell did they find us again?

01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:03.120
Wait a minute.

01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:07.566
They lost us when we went
in that cave, right?

01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:16.005
And they found you two when you
went outside with the rubies.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.241
We never even had a chance, then.

01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:21.640
We don't.

01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:24.160
But you do.

01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:26.522
I'm gonna hang on to this.

01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:33.202
GPS says he's around here somewhere.

01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:43.082
You two get to the border.

01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:48.250
You make him pay.

01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:49.890
Why would you do this for us?

01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:55.406
I guess I finally found
what I'm fighting for.

01:19:56.040 --> 01:19:57.246
Go.

01:19:58.160 --> 01:19:59.525
Go on.

01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:20.930
They've got to be here.

01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:29.967
What the fuck? Get him!

01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:53.443
Stop him! He cannot reach the border!

01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:55.363
No, no, no. I got you.

01:21:58.120 --> 01:21:59.451
Take him out, right now.

01:21:59.560 --> 01:22:02.325
You hear what I'm saying?
General wants to talk to you.

01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:07.569
Guess you want me to call for a boat.

01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:08.971
No. Something better.

01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:25.691
I see you, yes. I'm coming for you.

01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:31.641
I can see the look in your eyes.

01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:40.243
You remind me of a famous
Navarra bull. Murcielago.

01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:46.087
He survived 24 strikes of my lance.

01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:49.167
Come on.

01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:53.886
Come on!

01:22:59.160 --> 01:23:00.207
Win!

01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:14.084
Still on the move.

01:23:27.320 --> 01:23:28.765
Keep on your right.

01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:36.929
Bring it around again!

01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:43.163
He fought with such spirit

01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:47.006
that the crowd called
for his life to be spared.

01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:52.247
But sadly for you,
there is no crowd here today.

01:23:55.600 --> 01:23:58.001
No!

01:24:16.120 --> 01:24:19.363
He's almost at the border.
I don't think we can get him in time.

01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:22.646
Ah, it's a long walk to the other side.
Anything can happen.

01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:24.849
Let the troops know.

01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:27.128
Tell them to stop them
from getting to the Thai side.

01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:20.885
I ain't no bull.

01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:26.885
You son of a bitch.

01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:44.006
Wes.

01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:48.607
Keep him on the right.

01:25:49.640 --> 01:25:51.369
On the right. Don't lose his ass!

01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:12.483
Get us on that bridge!

01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:42.649
Fuck you, Aldrich. I win.

01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:44.006
Baylor!

01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:48.571
Wrong side of the bridge. Tough break.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:50.684
Guess you'll have to come through me.

01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:02.569
We'd like to invite you to join us
for a party in your honor!

01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:07.449
No regrets, please.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:09.240
Shit.

01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:21.163
This was meant for you.

01:28:37.640 --> 01:28:39.005
Come on.

01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:42.606
Come on.

01:28:57.800 --> 01:29:00.326
Aldrich! Let him go!

01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:11.320
And if I don't?

01:29:11.480 --> 01:29:14.086
They're called hard targets for a reason.

01:29:17.080 --> 01:29:19.606
You know what?
You look great in HD, Aldrich.

01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:22.646
Really captures what a prick you are.

01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:33.328
You have something that belongs to me.

01:29:33.720 --> 01:29:35.563
False sense of superiority?

01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:37.606
Memory card. Where is it?

01:29:38.200 --> 01:29:39.440
Ah, that.

01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:41.684
Yeah, it's safe.

01:29:43.240 --> 01:29:44.844
It's up my ass.

01:29:45.160 --> 01:29:47.242
Well, let me help you extract it.

01:29:53.880 --> 01:29:56.565
You know, I know you're not
that bright, Madden,

01:29:56.640 --> 01:29:59.086
but you do realize that wasn't my ass.

01:30:02.520 --> 01:30:04.568
I'm not the man you insult.

01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:12.166
I just can't tell what kind
of man you are, Baylor.

01:30:13.400 --> 01:30:15.880
So, I've been crawling,
rattling around in my brain,

01:30:15.960 --> 01:30:19.089
and then I suddenly realized,
you are just a nobody.

01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:21.407
You're just some savage animal.

01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:23.887
I mean, what you did to your best friend.

01:30:24.160 --> 01:30:29.291
Leaving a son without his father,
his wife a widow.

01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:31.403
I mean, if it was up to me,
I'd go out of my mind.

01:30:31.480 --> 01:30:33.847
Hell, I would just die.
I wouldn't be able to...

01:30:35.480 --> 01:30:38.563
Stop it. That's what he wants.
That's exactly what he wants.

01:30:38.760 --> 01:30:40.649
Death's just not enough for you, is it?

01:30:40.720 --> 01:30:42.529
You want to go out like your friend,
like a warrior.

01:30:42.680 --> 01:30:46.366
Just give me what I want,
and I'll be happy to oblige.

01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:48.883
No more shame, no more guilt.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:56.004
Unless, of course,
you don't have the card.

01:30:56.160 --> 01:30:57.889
You gave it to the girl.

01:30:58.080 --> 01:31:00.208
Then I'll hunt her down.

01:31:00.480 --> 01:31:02.448
But first, you know what?

01:31:03.720 --> 01:31:07.691
I think I deserve a little entertainment.
Did you bring the beer?

01:31:09.280 --> 01:31:12.489
You know, Baylor, I am going to enjoy

01:31:12.560 --> 01:31:14.483
watching you get your ass kicked.

01:31:14.560 --> 01:31:15.766
Thanks.

01:31:17.120 --> 01:31:19.885
So, I brought five friends.

01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:23.529
Let's see how they rip you apart
with their bare hands.

01:31:25.360 --> 01:31:29.729
One, two, three,
four guys and a little girl?

01:32:02.400 --> 01:32:03.811
Not you. Not yet.

01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:28.011
You know, you were
right about me, Aldrich.

01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:29.889
I was a nobody.

01:32:29.960 --> 01:32:33.806
No shot at redemption.
Not until you came along.

01:32:34.960 --> 01:32:36.564
Hell, son, you're welcome.

01:32:36.640 --> 01:32:40.850
Praise Jesus, you're saved.
Fighting spirit's back, huh?

01:32:42.360 --> 01:32:44.328
You gave me something to fight for.

01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:46.607
Now.

01:32:51.640 --> 01:32:55.531
What do you say, Baylor?
Don't pussy out on me now.

01:33:07.800 --> 01:33:10.690
Not bad, Baylor.
I thought you wouldn't have anything left.

01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:26.682
God damn, Baylor. You're the man.

01:33:29.280 --> 01:33:31.089
It's a shame to have to put you down.

01:33:52.920 --> 01:33:54.046
Wes!

01:33:55.720 --> 01:33:57.131
Don't do it!

01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:28.930
You know how this works, Aldrich.

01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:31.329
You get a two-minute head start.

01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:33.045
Get up.

01:34:34.760 --> 01:34:36.250
Get up!

01:34:57.800 --> 01:35:00.280
Ninety seconds.

01:35:23.720 --> 01:35:25.370
Sixty seconds!

01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:38.651
You're gonna have to kill me, Baylor.

01:35:39.560 --> 01:35:43.246
'Cause I have friends.
Rich, powerful friends.

01:35:53.040 --> 01:35:55.088
You think you can hunt me?

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.367
Who the hell do you think you are?

01:35:58.840 --> 01:36:01.161
You lose.

01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:08.647
General. Kill that asshole.

01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:09.966
Wait!

01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:19.045
Wait! Wait!

01:36:21.560 --> 01:36:24.166
General. I have the money.

01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:36.566
Lower your weapons.

01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:42.849
- What did you just say?
- It's okay.

01:36:42.960 --> 01:36:44.246
General.

01:36:45.720 --> 01:36:48.929
General, you dirty motherfucker!

01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:51.046
Shoot him!

01:37:26.200 --> 01:37:27.611
Thank you.

01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:45.091
So, you paid the General?

01:37:45.720 --> 01:37:46.960
Yes.

01:37:47.880 --> 01:37:50.645
Thanks to you,
he's letting us get back our lives.

01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:52.603
Return to our village.

01:37:54.520 --> 01:37:57.808
As long as we help him
look for the missing rubies.

01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:02.403
What missing rubies?

01:38:03.760 --> 01:38:05.524
The ones you lost in the jungle.

01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:08.804
Oh, you only gave him half?

01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:20.643
You're a good man, Wes.

01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:26.483
Get that house by the sea.

01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:08.682
I hope you don't blame yourself
for what happened.

01:39:08.920 --> 01:39:10.160
Fighters fight.

01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:13.369
What's important is finding
something to fight for.

01:39:14.520 --> 01:39:19.447
You asked for my forgiveness,
but I'm afraid I can't give it to you,

01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:22.808
because there is nothing to forgive.

01:39:22.880 --> 01:39:26.168
Thank you for what you've done for us.

01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:27.605
Love, Kay.

01:39:28.880 --> 01:39:32.202
P. S. We're still gonna keep
the beach house, though.

01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:44.169
As I said before,
pushing off the back leg,

01:39:44.280 --> 01:39:47.329
twisting, kicking with the shin.

01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:49.528
Twist all the way around.

01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:54.003
So, remember to twist that hip
all the way to the front.

01:39:54.080 --> 01:39:55.320
Twist the hip.

01:39:56.600 --> 01:39:58.728
I guess it's break time, guys.

01:39:59.080 --> 01:40:01.082
The boss says it's break time.

01:40:05.840 --> 01:40:09.686
Twist. See the hip? All the way around.
