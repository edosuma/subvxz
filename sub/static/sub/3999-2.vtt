WEBVTT

00:18.651 --> 00:20.152
JESS:
Hey, look who it is.

00:20.154 --> 00:22.221
It's Schmidt.
And, um...

00:22.223 --> 00:23.655
This is Barb.
Barb is leaving.

00:23.657 --> 00:24.857
Oh, Barb. Like the elephant.

00:24.859 --> 00:27.126
That's Babar, you dum-dum.

00:27.128 --> 00:30.129
Barbara.
A little potassium pick-me-up?

00:30.131 --> 00:31.230
Since I know
sleeping wasn't

00:31.232 --> 00:32.865
the main activity of the night.

00:32.867 --> 00:35.300
Thin walls. Just kidding.
They're very thick.

00:35.302 --> 00:37.536
You're just so loud!
(chuckles)

00:37.538 --> 00:40.239
You have a lot
of roommates.
So many of 'em. That's great.

00:40.241 --> 00:41.640
Bye, Barb.
- Bye, Barb.

00:41.642 --> 00:42.875
Bye, Schmidt.
(door shuts)

00:42.877 --> 00:44.710
That was the third piece
of nanny

00:44.712 --> 00:46.912
this week, am I right?
Sure is.

00:46.914 --> 00:49.048
Little shop talk from someone
who's also out there

00:49.050 --> 00:51.483
trying to crush butt herself.

00:51.485 --> 00:52.818
Um, where
are you meeting all

00:52.820 --> 00:55.521
these eligible singles,
these, uh, elly-sings?

00:55.523 --> 00:57.056
Dice.
- Hmm?

00:57.058 --> 00:59.191
It's kind of like Tinder.
Dice and Tinder.

00:59.193 --> 01:00.659
I've been to those bars.
They're downtown, right?

01:00.661 --> 01:02.728
(groans)
Dice is a dating app.

01:02.730 --> 01:04.496
Dating app.
- It's not for you.

01:04.498 --> 01:06.698
What? Schmidty.

01:06.700 --> 01:08.767
Come on.
I've Internet dated before.

01:08.769 --> 01:12.037
You send an e-mail, you
get excited, you wait,
you get an e-mail back.

01:12.039 --> 01:14.506
You are just describing
e-mailing.
Come on.

01:14.508 --> 01:17.042
You're gonna get eaten alive
on Dice. Do you want to see...
Come on, now.

01:17.044 --> 01:19.678
Do you want to see...
This is Dice. Come here.

01:19.680 --> 01:21.613
It's all about split-second
decisions, okay?

01:21.615 --> 01:23.182
You see a picture,
you swipe down for yes,

01:23.184 --> 01:24.683
you swipe up for no.
JESS: You're so fast.

01:24.685 --> 01:25.784
Instinct.
That's what it's about.

01:25.786 --> 01:27.619
Which you don't have.

01:27.621 --> 01:31.056
Now, I'm gonna go do
a deep-ass mouthwash.

01:31.058 --> 01:33.058
Don't go on Dice, Jess.

01:33.060 --> 01:34.626
I won't.

01:37.097 --> 01:40.365
Okay, now.

01:40.367 --> 01:42.734
New account.

01:42.736 --> 01:46.138
I am... darn tootin' fun.

01:46.140 --> 01:48.140
DTF.

01:48.142 --> 01:50.809
Seeks same.

01:50.811 --> 01:53.278
I'm Dicing.

01:53.280 --> 01:55.547
¶ Who's that girl? ¶

01:55.549 --> 01:57.983
¶<i> Who's that girl?</i> ¶
¶ It's Jess. ¶

02:02.455 --> 02:04.056
WINSTON:
<i>You know, I'm really enjoying</i>
<i>the police academy,</i>

02:04.058 --> 02:05.991
but, believe it
or not,

02:05.993 --> 02:08.160
I am not clicking socially
with the other cadets.

02:08.162 --> 02:09.294
What? Weird.
Oh, my God.

02:09.296 --> 02:11.130
No.
That's crazy.

02:11.132 --> 02:13.065
That is super shocking news.
I can't wrap my
head around that.

02:13.067 --> 02:14.933
That just doesn't add up.
Everyone's got
a nickname but me.

02:14.935 --> 02:17.769
Yo, Swoops! What up, Gunner?
(chuckles)

02:17.771 --> 02:19.838
Hey, Winston Bishop.

02:19.840 --> 02:21.173
Why don't you just go ask them

02:21.175 --> 02:22.641
if you can hang out
with them sometime?

02:22.643 --> 02:24.076
I mean, what's the worst
that could happen?

02:24.078 --> 02:26.478
Just invite myself?
Now, that's just rude.

02:26.480 --> 02:29.314
Winnie the Bish
wasn't raised to be rude.

02:29.316 --> 02:31.950
Now, save my seat.
I got to go make a caca.

02:31.952 --> 02:34.586
I can't believe we're
gonna live with a cop.

02:34.588 --> 02:37.356
I mean, can we still do illegal
things? Like, I don't know,

02:37.358 --> 02:39.091
what if I want to get
stoned or something?

02:39.093 --> 02:40.425
I've actually never
gotten stoned before.

02:40.427 --> 02:42.361
You've never been stoned?
What?

02:42.363 --> 02:43.695
Should I do it before
he becomes a cop?

02:43.697 --> 02:45.130
We could do this.
- Really?

02:45.132 --> 02:46.999
We're adults. We can
smoke a little weed.

02:47.001 --> 02:48.600
I think we should do it.
It's been a while.

02:48.602 --> 02:50.035
I pick up stuff
really quick.

02:50.037 --> 02:52.037
You can't just pick up
pot and be good at it.

02:52.039 --> 02:54.873
Like everything else in
life, it takes practice.
Yeah, if pot

02:54.875 --> 02:56.942
were a piano, Nick would be
a nine-year-old Chinese girl.

02:56.944 --> 02:59.144
Daddy's here to take
care of you. I'm gonna
guide you through it.

02:59.146 --> 03:00.946
I'll be your
spiritual guru.

03:00.948 --> 03:02.614
And Mommy's got nothing
to do this afternoon,

03:02.616 --> 03:04.016
so I'm gonna bake
some damn brownies

03:04.018 --> 03:05.284
so we can all freak out.

03:05.286 --> 03:07.719
Let's do it.
We're getting stoned?

03:07.721 --> 03:09.888
This is like watching a meeting
of idiot 12-year-olds.

03:09.890 --> 03:12.024
The hell is that?
What is that noise?
(ringtone playing)

03:12.026 --> 03:13.492
Your cellular technology.

03:13.494 --> 03:16.895
I haven't gotten
a non-text message in two years.

03:16.897 --> 03:18.530
Jess?

03:18.532 --> 03:21.533
Hey, uh... so, I Diced

03:21.535 --> 03:24.169
and it was great. Um,

03:24.171 --> 03:27.339
but could I
get a ride?

03:27.341 --> 03:29.942
You sure you don't want
to hop on for a second?

03:32.412 --> 03:35.847
Do you have a dog,
or is this all you?

03:35.849 --> 03:37.416
Which would you prefer?

03:37.418 --> 03:39.218
(barks)

03:40.720 --> 03:43.488
Schmidt, will you at least
just talk to me, please?

03:45.158 --> 03:46.825
He looked nice in his picture.

03:48.161 --> 03:49.895
The frame cut off the bottom
of his beard,

03:49.897 --> 03:51.997
so how was I to know it was
braided into a beardy tail?

03:51.999 --> 03:54.166
Mmm.
- He asked me

03:54.168 --> 03:56.001
to the food court
near his house.

03:56.003 --> 03:58.270
I thought that was
down-to-earth, and I liked that.

03:58.272 --> 03:59.738
He didn't bring
any money,

03:59.740 --> 04:01.907
so we had to go back
to his apartment.

04:01.909 --> 04:05.410
And also he wanted to show me
some of his old baby clothes.

04:05.412 --> 04:07.346
(groans)

04:08.548 --> 04:10.282
Maybe I'm not ready for Dice.

04:10.284 --> 04:12.251
Will you just
help me, please?

04:12.253 --> 04:14.620
I want to get back out there.
I have to...

04:14.622 --> 04:16.588
I need to get
back out there.

04:16.590 --> 04:17.623
And I know I'm gullible.

04:17.625 --> 04:18.924
'Cause people tell me that,

04:18.926 --> 04:20.926
and I have no reason not
to believe them.

04:22.195 --> 04:24.263
Teach me to Dice.

04:28.801 --> 04:31.136
Is that a yes?
(mutters)

04:31.138 --> 04:32.938
Schmidt?

04:32.940 --> 04:35.007
What's happening?

04:37.644 --> 04:39.211
Ah! What the hell?

04:39.213 --> 04:41.680
I will teach you Dice.

04:50.223 --> 04:52.557
Welcome and...

04:52.559 --> 04:54.159
good morning.

04:54.161 --> 04:56.461
It's weird here in the morning.
It is very sad.

04:56.463 --> 04:58.130
Now, over the next
1,000 minutes,

04:58.132 --> 05:00.065
your notions of dating
will be challenged.

05:00.067 --> 05:02.234
Jess, just listen. No notes.
I'm sorry.

05:02.236 --> 05:05.170
You put notebooks and pens
on the table, so I thought...
I totally get it.

05:05.172 --> 05:07.306
Look, Jess, you're nervous.
Would you like some water?

05:07.308 --> 05:08.740
Oh, thank you.
- Of course.

05:08.742 --> 05:10.776
That's really nice of...
Never show weakness.

05:10.778 --> 05:14.179
Write that down.
Now, you're on Dice

05:14.181 --> 05:16.081
and this hunk shows up.

05:16.083 --> 05:18.517
Hubba hubba, Mama in trubba.

05:18.519 --> 05:19.418
Don't ever do that again.

05:19.420 --> 05:20.786
Okay.
- So you find

05:20.788 --> 05:22.454
this man.
He looks like a Hemsworth,

05:22.456 --> 05:23.689
if you will.

05:23.691 --> 05:25.624
He swipes down,
you swipe down,

05:25.626 --> 05:28.627
you guys set a date. I show up.

05:28.629 --> 05:30.429
Hey, how you doing?
I'm Jack Steele.

05:30.431 --> 05:32.130
Hi, Jack.
(buzzing)

05:32.132 --> 05:35.167
Wrong.
Is that our Taboo buzzer?

05:35.169 --> 05:37.002
Not important. Why did I buzz?
Do you think
you could

05:37.004 --> 05:38.704
just return it to the box
when you're done with it?

05:38.706 --> 05:41.273
The reason I buzzed is because
I look nothing like this person.

05:41.275 --> 05:43.041
Look at this. There's
a sun-kissed sweetie.

05:43.043 --> 05:44.776
I am a rugged Semitic prince.

05:44.778 --> 05:46.978
I thought we were role-playing.
Role-playing?

05:46.980 --> 05:48.447
What about this feels
like a game to you?

05:48.449 --> 05:51.316
(buzzing)
(phone chimes)

05:51.318 --> 05:53.685
Ooh, I got a Dice match.

05:53.687 --> 05:54.686
Jacob.

05:54.688 --> 05:57.122
He has dreamy eyes.

05:57.124 --> 05:58.790
Them's joint-bank-account eyes.
Okay,

05:58.792 --> 06:00.692
if you're saying things like
"dreamy eyes" to my face,

06:00.694 --> 06:03.495
we have more work to do
than the Kings of Leon.

06:03.497 --> 06:06.298
Good band, but it feels
like they are stuck in
one place musically.

06:06.300 --> 06:07.632
Well, I have a good feeling
about this guy.

06:07.634 --> 06:08.533
Okay.
- I'm gonna
ask him out.

06:08.535 --> 06:09.835
Hey.

06:09.837 --> 06:11.370
You're not ready yet.

06:13.039 --> 06:15.474
I'm s...
I'm sorry about your phone.

06:15.476 --> 06:17.075
I'm sure you have
the protection plan.

06:17.077 --> 06:18.577
I do have the...
(buzzing)

06:18.579 --> 06:21.246
Never get the protection plan!

06:21.248 --> 06:23.215
NICK:
The oceans are very wild.

06:23.217 --> 06:25.851
No man or piece
of scientific technology

06:25.853 --> 06:28.186
has ever been to the bottom
of the ocean.

06:28.188 --> 06:30.355
<i>Titanic</i> did.
- Uh,<i> Titanic</i> sunk
down there,

06:30.357 --> 06:31.757
but that's not
to the bottom.

06:31.759 --> 06:33.525
No, the man who
made<i> Titanic</i> did.

06:33.527 --> 06:35.927
I don't know
what Manhoo is, but...

06:35.929 --> 06:37.529
You guys seem a lot higher
than me.

06:37.531 --> 06:39.865
Well, it hits everybody
at different times, Hoss.

06:39.867 --> 06:41.600
(door opens)
- But it's coming for you.

06:41.602 --> 06:43.435
My people!
(chuckles)

06:43.437 --> 06:45.704
Time to rally, everybody.
We are going to a party.

06:45.706 --> 06:48.106
I took Cece's advice
and decided to invite myself

06:48.108 --> 06:50.275
to hang out
with some of the other guys,

06:50.277 --> 06:52.444
and I think
y'all should roll with.

06:52.446 --> 06:54.045
Make me look cooler.

06:54.047 --> 06:56.782
I'll totally go to a
party on your butt.

06:56.784 --> 06:57.616
What?

06:57.618 --> 06:59.618
(laughing)
- No. No.

06:59.620 --> 07:02.220
Now, that is a humorous image.

07:02.222 --> 07:05.357
What?

07:05.359 --> 07:07.426
But, seriously, you have to go.
Oh, no, no, no, no.

07:07.428 --> 07:08.894
Know-know what? We're gonna go.

07:08.896 --> 07:09.961
We're gonna go.

07:09.963 --> 07:11.797
Okay.
We're gonna go.

07:11.799 --> 07:13.799
We're gonna go. We're gonna go.

07:13.801 --> 07:15.300
You're gonna go?
Hey, we're gonna go.

07:15.302 --> 07:16.802
We're gonna go.

07:16.804 --> 07:18.370
We're gonna go.
Right on, right on.

07:18.372 --> 07:20.138
Well, then we'll go.

07:20.140 --> 07:21.640
(chuckling):
Yeah.

07:21.642 --> 07:23.041
You guys are way too messed up
to be going.

07:23.043 --> 07:25.277
You're not an expert. I am.

07:25.279 --> 07:26.611
Nobody knows we're stoned.

07:26.613 --> 07:27.979
If we didn't go,
then they would know.

07:27.981 --> 07:29.214
You're saying that be...

07:29.216 --> 07:30.782
if we don't go to the party,

07:30.784 --> 07:32.150
they're gonna think
that we're high.

07:32.152 --> 07:34.319
Oh, the guy
who's never done weed.

07:34.321 --> 07:36.154
That's not the proper term.
It's "smoked weed."

07:36.156 --> 07:37.823
You don't "do weed."
That's a test.

07:37.825 --> 07:39.558
You said it.
- Listen to me,

07:39.560 --> 07:42.160
first order of business,
we eat their food.

07:42.162 --> 07:45.597
Okay.
- Then you look at the pool.
"Aw, what a great pool.

07:45.599 --> 07:49.568
I wish... I wish
I could dive for rings."

07:49.570 --> 07:53.104
Because if you were stoned,
you wouldn't dive for rings.

07:53.106 --> 07:56.475
Um, I was just thinking
of this impression.

07:57.977 --> 07:59.344
Who am I doing?

08:02.014 --> 08:03.915
Who am I doing?
- Al Pacino?

08:03.917 --> 08:06.985
Maybe. So, then,

08:06.987 --> 08:09.321
you get home,
you eat some pizza...

08:09.323 --> 08:11.857
Trust me. I just thought
of every single possibility

08:11.859 --> 08:14.593
of what could happen at that
party, and none of them are bad.

08:14.595 --> 08:16.695
Ooh. Wow.

08:16.697 --> 08:20.265
This is a big party.
I'm talking wall-to-wall cops.

08:20.267 --> 08:22.167
Man.

08:26.372 --> 08:28.340
Oh, I did not
think this through.

08:28.342 --> 08:30.876
(giggling)

08:30.878 --> 08:34.446
It just hit me.

08:34.448 --> 08:35.847
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey,

08:35.849 --> 08:37.449
hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Be cool.

08:37.451 --> 08:39.851
And that is why-- no matter
how tricked out it is--

08:39.853 --> 08:41.520
you never get into a van.

08:41.522 --> 08:43.889
"No van."
Okay. Moving on.

08:43.891 --> 08:45.123
Classic warning signs.

08:45.125 --> 08:46.491
Now, last night, the crazy man

08:46.493 --> 08:48.460
said he needed to meet you
near his house.

08:48.462 --> 08:50.128
What he was really saying was,

08:50.130 --> 08:51.863
"I expect tonight
to end in sex."

08:51.865 --> 08:54.633
Or maybe he doesn't like
to be far from his pets.

08:54.635 --> 08:56.801
Never date a man with pets.
The only acceptable pet

08:56.803 --> 09:00.205
for a man to have is a
saltwater fish. Okay, what now?

09:00.207 --> 09:02.007
Okay, first test.
Now, I'm gonna say something,

09:02.009 --> 09:04.643
and you tell me
what's really being said.

09:04.645 --> 09:07.078
Oh, you know, I'm just staying
in a hotel right now.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.647
"I like to travel."

09:08.649 --> 09:11.016
(buzzing)
Homeless. Pervert.

09:11.018 --> 09:14.185
Oh, my God, my mom is just
the most amazing woman.

09:14.187 --> 09:15.587
Oh. "I love my mother."

09:15.589 --> 09:16.888
(buzzing)

09:16.890 --> 09:19.491
Virgin. And somehow
also a pervert.

09:19.493 --> 09:22.093
I kind of prefer
public transportation.

09:22.095 --> 09:23.662
Oh. Earth-conscious.

09:23.664 --> 09:25.564
(buzzing)
Multiple DUIs.

09:25.566 --> 09:26.665
(buzzing)

09:26.667 --> 09:28.500
Pervert.

09:28.502 --> 09:30.001
Okay, time for the next phase.

09:30.003 --> 09:31.369
Next phase?
Jess?

09:31.371 --> 09:34.272
Hi. I'm Malcolm. From Dice?
Oh...

09:34.274 --> 09:35.907
Oh.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.909
Hi.
Hey.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.744
She'll be with you
in just a minute.

09:39.746 --> 09:41.513
Okay.

09:41.515 --> 09:43.582
You set me up on a date?
I'm wearing my

09:43.584 --> 09:45.784
lounge-around underwear.
I set you up on ten dates.

09:45.786 --> 09:47.452
What?
Ten years of experience
in one day.

09:47.454 --> 09:48.620
Expert by midnight.

09:48.622 --> 09:50.121
The Dice<i> Diez.</i>

09:50.123 --> 09:51.523
<i>"Diez"</i> is Spanish for ten.

09:51.525 --> 09:53.525
Are you insane, Schmidt?
I'm not ready.

09:53.527 --> 09:55.894
That's like taking a musical
from rehearsals

09:55.896 --> 09:58.263
straight to Broadway.
You got to workshop it first...

09:58.265 --> 09:59.731
If you are
for one second suggesting

09:59.733 --> 10:01.199
that I don't know
how to open a musical...

10:01.201 --> 10:03.201
How dare you? I'm trying
to help you out here.

10:03.203 --> 10:05.470
Now, of course you're
not ready, Jess.

10:05.472 --> 10:07.939
That's why I set up ten dates.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.741
Now, you can do this. Come on.

10:09.743 --> 10:11.943
All right.

10:11.945 --> 10:12.944
So...

10:12.946 --> 10:14.245
So.
Date talk.

10:14.247 --> 10:16.214
Okay.
- (chuckles) What do you do?

10:16.216 --> 10:18.750
Um, well, I don't have a job,
currently, right now,

10:18.752 --> 10:21.086
in the traditional
"nine to five" sense,

10:21.088 --> 10:23.588
but, uh, I got a lot cooking.

10:23.590 --> 10:27.158
I "grow" "raisins."

10:29.595 --> 10:31.896
I'm sorry, Malcolm, um,

10:31.898 --> 10:33.965
I'm gonna have to...

10:34.900 --> 10:36.067
(whispering):
Get out of there.

10:36.069 --> 10:38.069
...let you finish that story.

10:38.071 --> 10:41.172
Oh, okay. I grow
two types of raisins.

10:41.174 --> 10:42.941
There's the Leopold raisin,

10:42.943 --> 10:44.609
which is from Austria.
- Mm-hmm.

10:44.611 --> 10:46.111
And then there's
the Zwiebel raisin,

10:46.113 --> 10:47.879
which is also from Austria.

10:51.784 --> 10:52.917
But I think the main thing

10:52.919 --> 10:54.285
that got me
through my time in prison

10:54.287 --> 10:55.587
was the realization

10:55.589 --> 10:57.255
that a "raisin" can be anything.

10:57.257 --> 10:58.657
We got to go!

10:58.659 --> 11:00.425
(in Southern accent):
Ma called. The bees are back.

11:00.427 --> 11:01.760
Ma called. The bees are back.

11:01.762 --> 11:03.428
Oh, okay. Um...

11:03.430 --> 11:05.196
Should I just...
Should I wait for you?

11:05.198 --> 11:07.265
You know that was
a bad date, right?

11:07.267 --> 11:09.367
I know, but I just felt
so trapped.

11:09.369 --> 11:11.936
Just do what I did, make up
an excuse and then leave.

11:11.938 --> 11:14.105
Just-just say as little
as you need to, okay?

11:14.107 --> 11:15.173
Make it your own.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.274
You ready?
- Yeah.

11:16.276 --> 11:17.509
You can do this.
Okay.

11:17.511 --> 11:18.943
You have so much hair.
What?

11:18.945 --> 11:19.978
Where did all that
hair come from?

11:19.980 --> 11:21.046
You're like a lioness.

11:21.048 --> 11:22.681
So, did you know you could put

11:22.683 --> 11:24.849
a whole live chicken
in your mouth and eat it

11:24.851 --> 11:27.852
without plucking it
or preparing it at all?

11:29.321 --> 11:30.822
(whispering):
Keep it simple.

11:30.824 --> 11:31.956
Uh, let's keep it simple.

11:31.958 --> 11:33.124
You're a nice guy,

11:33.126 --> 11:34.626
and that's a neat outfit.

11:34.628 --> 11:36.494
Are you a chef?
Are you a beatnik?

11:36.496 --> 11:37.562
Are... Do you work on...

11:37.564 --> 11:38.997
on a submarine?
- Shh.

11:38.999 --> 11:40.131
No! No!

11:40.133 --> 11:41.299
Oh.
- Stand down,

11:41.301 --> 11:42.534
sir!
- We found your son.

11:42.536 --> 11:43.635
He's alive.

11:43.637 --> 11:45.470
They found my son; he's alive.

11:45.472 --> 11:47.806
I'm sorry.
It was nice meeting you.

11:47.808 --> 11:49.307
WINSTON:
All right, now, remember,

11:49.309 --> 11:50.408
y'all are my dogs, okay?

11:50.410 --> 11:51.643
So just stay by my side

11:51.645 --> 11:53.044
and make me look cool.

11:53.046 --> 11:55.747
If I tell a joke,
dogs got to bark.

11:55.749 --> 11:58.316
(laughs) I want to see those
tails wagging out there, okay?

11:58.318 --> 12:00.151
Oh, okay, look.

12:00.153 --> 12:01.486
Look, there's Dugan.
There's Dugan.

12:01.488 --> 12:04.355
That's the guy I was
telling you about. Come on.

12:04.357 --> 12:06.391
Over there is better.

12:06.393 --> 12:07.492
All right.

12:07.494 --> 12:09.594
What?
- Whatever the hell that means.

12:09.596 --> 12:11.696
Is there a cop
in the house? (laughs)

12:11.698 --> 12:14.332
I feel really calm.
Really relaxed.

12:14.334 --> 12:16.401
Oh, look, a hummingbird.
What the hell
are you talking about?

12:16.403 --> 12:18.269
There's no such thing
as a hummingbird.

12:18.271 --> 12:19.904
Birds don't hum.

12:19.906 --> 12:21.072
They sing.

12:21.074 --> 12:22.707
They basically
invented singing.

12:22.709 --> 12:24.409
You're so high
right now, man.

12:24.411 --> 12:26.711
You're so high, I couldn't
possibly even bring you back.

12:26.713 --> 12:28.747
Actually, dude,
I feel really good.

12:28.749 --> 12:30.348
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
when you walk,

12:30.350 --> 12:31.850
you look like an insane person.

12:31.852 --> 12:35.420
Okay? And your voice sounds
so stoned and crazy.

12:35.422 --> 12:36.855
Say something.

12:36.857 --> 12:38.389
Hello, Nick.

12:38.391 --> 12:40.291
(laughs)

12:40.293 --> 12:42.393
That took you, like, 20 minutes.

12:42.395 --> 12:44.362
"Hello, Nick."

12:44.364 --> 12:46.898
And now I'm a model
and a bartender.

12:46.900 --> 12:48.533
But I...

12:48.535 --> 12:50.902
I'm not sure what's next.
I feel a little lost.

12:50.904 --> 12:53.171
I'm not exactly sure
what I'm doing with my life.

12:54.273 --> 12:55.406
I'm so sorry.

12:55.408 --> 12:56.641
What was your question again?

12:56.643 --> 12:58.309
I didn't ask you anything.

12:58.311 --> 13:00.812
You just walked up
and started talking.

13:00.814 --> 13:02.380
So, man, I'm in the locker room,

13:02.382 --> 13:04.048
and I see a spider,
and I'm like,

13:04.050 --> 13:05.316
"I hope this is<i> Charlotte's Web</i>

13:05.318 --> 13:06.618
and you're nice."

13:09.555 --> 13:11.055
You haven't seen
<i>Charlotte's Web?</i>

13:11.057 --> 13:12.624
<i>Charlotte's Web,</i>
the, uh, cartoon.

13:12.626 --> 13:15.393
The tale about the spider who
was super chill and super cool.

13:15.395 --> 13:17.295
Then, well, series of events,
she ended up dying.

13:17.297 --> 13:18.730
So that was sad.

13:18.732 --> 13:20.899
That was sad, but spoiler alert,
if you haven't seen it.

13:20.901 --> 13:22.233
I'm sure you...
You haven't seen it.

13:22.235 --> 13:25.837
Where are my dogs?

13:25.839 --> 13:28.239
I took the liberty of writing
down some exit lines,

13:28.241 --> 13:30.608
because obviously, you can't
come up with any on your own.

13:30.610 --> 13:32.410
Here, take a look at those.

13:32.412 --> 13:34.078
I've got hockey practice?

13:34.080 --> 13:36.247
Sure.
My boss is trying to contact me

13:36.249 --> 13:38.449
about a project
that could save the company.

13:38.451 --> 13:39.417
Mm-hmm.
- Schmidt,

13:39.419 --> 13:40.752
these are such
obvious rejections.

13:40.754 --> 13:42.086
I don't want to hurt
their feelings.

13:42.088 --> 13:43.121
Hurt their feel...

13:43.123 --> 13:44.589
Do you just walk around all day

13:44.591 --> 13:45.790
thinking about other
people's feelings?

13:45.792 --> 13:46.958
Yeah. Don't you?

13:46.960 --> 13:48.459
No.

13:48.461 --> 13:49.627
How do you get anything done?

13:49.629 --> 13:51.596
It's hard.
- Okay, Jess,

13:51.598 --> 13:53.932
how can I put this?

13:53.934 --> 13:56.267
You're the prize here.

13:56.269 --> 13:58.303
Okay?

13:58.305 --> 14:00.605
You are the last piece of pie,
and all of these guys

14:00.607 --> 14:02.006
are the fat kids
in the cafeteria,

14:02.008 --> 14:04.442
and I can say that because
I used to be fat as a truck.

14:04.444 --> 14:06.144
You really think
I'm the last piece of pie?

14:06.146 --> 14:08.379
Damn right you're
the last piece of pie.

14:08.381 --> 14:10.281
You're the best
girl on Dice, Jess.

14:10.283 --> 14:12.617
And who cares what
these guys are feeling?

14:12.619 --> 14:14.485
You know, what do you feel?

14:14.487 --> 14:16.621
Jess, what do you want?

14:16.623 --> 14:17.689
I'm the pie.

14:17.691 --> 14:19.324
You're the pie.
- I'm the pie.

14:19.326 --> 14:20.725
Say it again.
- I'm the pie.

14:20.727 --> 14:22.227
Say it again.
- <i>I'm</i> the pie.

14:22.229 --> 14:23.962
There you go.

14:23.964 --> 14:25.129
Who are you?

14:26.065 --> 14:27.632
Never really thought about that.

14:27.634 --> 14:28.733
Mmm.

14:28.735 --> 14:30.301
I'm not gay,

14:30.303 --> 14:33.638
but I would go crazy
on Michael Strahan.

14:33.640 --> 14:38.209
A prominent U.S. senator
is trying to contact me.

14:40.179 --> 14:42.747
You know, I just think
Meryl Streep is a dumb bitch.

14:42.749 --> 14:45.383
An important document
has gone missing.

14:45.385 --> 14:47.452
I need to find it.

14:48.520 --> 14:49.754
I've been getting
into a lot

14:49.756 --> 14:51.222
of fist fights lately.

14:51.224 --> 14:52.357
Like, a lot.

14:52.359 --> 14:53.658
More than usual.

14:53.660 --> 14:54.993
But, you know,

14:54.995 --> 14:56.828
I'm kind of enjoying them now.

14:56.830 --> 14:59.063
I have an acquaintance
who's in jeopardy.

15:03.435 --> 15:04.936
Jess?

15:04.938 --> 15:07.338
Nope, not Jess.

15:08.274 --> 15:10.508
Velcro shoes, pervert.

15:11.343 --> 15:13.411
I didn't even see those.

15:14.713 --> 15:17.348
I would love for you to share...

15:17.350 --> 15:19.617
share...

15:19.619 --> 15:22.086
what you think
I should do with my life.

15:24.456 --> 15:26.691
Am I boring you now?

15:26.693 --> 15:28.760
Officer,
can I read you your rights?

15:30.062 --> 15:33.197
You have the right
to remain hugged.

15:33.199 --> 15:34.532
(laughter)

15:34.534 --> 15:36.234
Oh, no, Coach!

15:36.236 --> 15:37.869
And you have the right
to remain sweet.

15:37.871 --> 15:39.070
(laughter)

15:39.072 --> 15:41.039
Run! Diversion!

15:41.041 --> 15:43.207
Run! Run! Now! Now!
Uh, du...? Whoa. Hold on!

15:43.209 --> 15:45.376
What's with your friends,
Winston Bishop?

15:45.378 --> 15:48.379
They kicked over the grill,
and then they ran that way.

15:48.381 --> 15:49.814
Yeah... I know.

15:50.916 --> 15:53.084
Wow. Last date.

15:53.086 --> 15:54.819
It's a big moment.

15:54.821 --> 15:57.889
Oh, my God, is that
who I think it is?

15:57.891 --> 16:00.091
I give you
Dreamy Eyes Jacob.

16:00.093 --> 16:01.893
Happy Dice
birthday, Jess.

16:01.895 --> 16:04.228
You're ready for this.
Now, go get him.

16:04.230 --> 16:06.597
Thank you, sir.

16:06.599 --> 16:08.066
JESS:
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

16:08.068 --> 16:10.234
Are you from Portland?
The Jolly Cow Creamery.

16:10.236 --> 16:12.170
Yeah, I used to work there
summers in high school.

16:12.172 --> 16:14.439
No way. I'm from Portland, too.
Are you serious?

16:14.441 --> 16:16.441
Yes. I used to go there
all the time in high school.

16:16.443 --> 16:17.942
Oh, my God.
- That's so funny.

16:17.944 --> 16:19.811
(laughter)

16:21.580 --> 16:23.348
Yeah, I hope
you like this place.

16:23.350 --> 16:25.316
I live, like,
right across the street, so...

16:27.753 --> 16:30.121
Oh. (clears throat)
I get it.

16:30.123 --> 16:32.590
You asked me here
because

16:32.592 --> 16:34.859
you want me to go home
with you.
- Wait. What?

16:34.861 --> 16:36.527
No. Um, you know what?
I got to go.

16:36.529 --> 16:38.029
I have hockey practice.

16:38.031 --> 16:39.931
I'm center wing,
so they really need me.
- I... Wow.

16:39.933 --> 16:42.300
Okay, I just live
across the street.

16:42.302 --> 16:45.770
I'm not some weirdo trying to
lure you back to my apartment.

16:45.772 --> 16:47.605
I thought we were kind
of hitting it off.

16:47.607 --> 16:49.941
Guess you just make
a snap decision,

16:49.943 --> 16:51.642
and then that's it, so...

16:51.644 --> 16:53.945
All right, well,
have a good practice.

16:53.947 --> 16:58.516
And by the way, there's
no center wing in hockey.

17:02.287 --> 17:03.788
The Dice Diez!

17:03.790 --> 17:04.922
You did it!

17:05.891 --> 17:07.625
This thing is on!

17:07.627 --> 17:09.293
How do you open it?

17:09.295 --> 17:11.963
Oh, wow. This isn't
even champagne.

17:11.965 --> 17:14.132
Look, it's a super
fancy salad dressing.

17:14.134 --> 17:15.633
That is delightful.

17:20.839 --> 17:23.641
We are celebrating-- me and you.
Jess, you can have whatever

17:23.643 --> 17:25.810
you want on the menu.
They got pizza, gelato,

17:25.812 --> 17:27.578
tikka masala.

17:27.580 --> 17:29.580
A raw bar. This place
is doing too much.

17:29.582 --> 17:31.983
They can't be doing all this
right. What's wrong with you?

17:31.985 --> 17:33.518
I just don't understand how

17:33.520 --> 17:35.820
what we did today
is gonna help me find love.

17:35.822 --> 17:37.488
Love?

17:37.490 --> 17:38.856
Well, why would you want
to fall in love?

17:38.858 --> 17:40.658
Why else would I go on dates?

17:40.660 --> 17:43.361
The point of dating is just
to keep on dating,

17:43.363 --> 17:45.263
and then never stop.

17:45.265 --> 17:47.365
It's like burning fossil fuels
or seeing a therapist.

17:47.367 --> 17:49.667
No. Schmidt, the whole point

17:49.669 --> 17:53.271
of going on dates is to fall
in love and have a relationship.

17:53.273 --> 17:56.007
Like, don't you ever worry
that you're missing out?

17:56.009 --> 17:59.177
I mean, you're plowing
through all these girls,

17:59.179 --> 18:02.947
and some of 'em might be great,
but you'll never know.

18:02.949 --> 18:05.450
Do you want to go
through life that way?

18:06.685 --> 18:08.886
Yeah.

18:08.888 --> 18:11.589
I don't.

18:17.396 --> 18:19.897
Oh, hey, yeah.
I'll take the, um...

18:19.899 --> 18:21.866
the rock shrimp meatballs.

18:21.868 --> 18:23.734
What is this place?

18:23.736 --> 18:25.303
(shushing)

18:25.305 --> 18:28.039
I think
my life is going nowhere.

18:28.041 --> 18:29.540
Oh.
- Mmm.

18:29.542 --> 18:31.709
No, Cece. It's
wonderful here.

18:31.711 --> 18:33.044
Do you like to learn?

18:33.046 --> 18:34.479
I do.

18:34.481 --> 18:36.047
I see you going back to school.

18:36.049 --> 18:39.150
I see it, too.
- Yes, yes.

18:39.152 --> 18:41.219
I don't see it.
- Yes.

18:41.221 --> 18:43.654
She's a bartender.
How is she gonna pay for it?

18:43.656 --> 18:46.924
(Cece and Coach hum
"Pomp and Circumstance")
She's not very good at it.

18:46.926 --> 18:49.060
(all humming
"Pomp and Circumstance")

18:49.062 --> 18:51.129
(beatboxing)

18:53.332 --> 18:54.265
On the floor!
- Shut up!

18:54.267 --> 18:58.236
(yelling, overlapping chatter)

18:58.238 --> 19:00.071
(shouting and yelling)
CECE: Get the dog!

19:00.073 --> 19:02.840
Get down on the ground!
Yeah, and stay down!
- No!

19:02.842 --> 19:04.742
(indistinct,
overlapping chatter)
CECE: I'm a student!

19:04.744 --> 19:06.577
Both of you, butts up.
I'm trying.

19:06.579 --> 19:07.912
I'm trying.

19:07.914 --> 19:12.250
(laughter)

19:12.252 --> 19:13.851
See, I see you guys were high,

19:13.853 --> 19:16.921
so I got these guys
to come and mess with you.

19:16.923 --> 19:18.956
(laughter)

19:18.958 --> 19:20.591
Let's go, man.

19:20.593 --> 19:22.793
Let's never do drugs again.

19:22.795 --> 19:24.962
That was a lot
of fun... Toilet.

19:24.964 --> 19:27.198
"Toilet." Is that...
is that my nickname?

19:27.200 --> 19:28.799
DUGAN:
Yeah, 'cause living
with these guys,

19:28.801 --> 19:31.769
you got to put up
with a lot of crap.
Lot of crap. (laughs)

19:31.771 --> 19:32.770
DUGAN:
Let's get a beer.

19:32.772 --> 19:36.374
Thank you very much.

19:36.376 --> 19:38.376
Flush, flush, what's the rush?

19:38.378 --> 19:39.710
Toilet's coming!

19:39.712 --> 19:41.212
You guys want
to go back in?

19:41.214 --> 19:42.847
Yeah.
- Yeah.

19:43.815 --> 19:46.050
Thanks for coming back.
- Sure.

19:46.052 --> 19:48.286
Look, I'm...
I'm really sorry.

19:48.288 --> 19:50.655
Um, I was... I don't
know where to begin.

19:50.657 --> 19:52.823
Uh, my roommate
taught me all of these

19:52.825 --> 19:54.825
phony excuses to
get out of dates.

19:54.827 --> 19:58.129
Wow.
- Anyway, that
is not me.

19:58.131 --> 20:00.164
Okay.
- So...

20:00.166 --> 20:02.300
will you give me another
chance to get to know you?

20:02.302 --> 20:03.801
Yeah.

20:03.803 --> 20:05.236
Let's go back in
and get a drink.

20:05.238 --> 20:06.737
Yes. Great.

20:06.739 --> 20:10.341
Hey, uh, you know, we can just
make that last date disappear.

20:10.343 --> 20:13.611
Like... this coin.

20:19.351 --> 20:21.052
(laughing):
Oh.

20:21.054 --> 20:22.820
You're a magician.

20:22.822 --> 20:24.488
No. Ugh. No.

20:24.490 --> 20:26.490
I'm a comedy magician.

20:26.492 --> 20:29.026
Even better.

20:29.028 --> 20:31.028
And, like a lot
of people in comedy,

20:31.030 --> 20:34.332
I have a little problem
with, uh... nose candy.

20:34.334 --> 20:36.234
Uh-oh.

20:38.737 --> 20:40.438
Can't have this.
It's my last one.

20:40.440 --> 20:41.505
(laughing):
No...

20:41.507 --> 20:42.506
I'm kidding. Take it.

20:42.508 --> 20:43.674
I don't want it.
- Please take it.

20:43.676 --> 20:44.675
No, you take it.

20:44.677 --> 20:46.477
Okay. Let's go in.

20:48.347 --> 20:50.214
(quietly):
Schmidt?

20:50.216 --> 20:53.084
I totally didn't think I'd
ever hear from you again.

20:53.086 --> 20:55.386
Well, you know,
I just figured,

20:55.388 --> 20:57.121
why not see
if there's something here?

20:57.123 --> 20:59.357
You know, let's hang out,
get to know each other.

20:59.359 --> 21:01.292
There's a coffee place
down the street.

21:01.294 --> 21:04.929
Maybe we could go...
grab a cup of joe.

21:05.964 --> 21:08.032
I don't think you
understand Dice.

21:09.368 --> 21:10.868
Okay.

21:10.870 --> 21:12.870
(door closes)

21:12.872 --> 21:14.839
SCHMIDT:
<i>Jessica!</i>

21:16.041 --> 21:18.142
I'm late to officiate
a giant's wedding,

21:18.144 --> 21:19.477
and these are stuck.

21:19.479 --> 21:20.945
(Jacob giggles)

21:23.215 --> 21:24.715
Now the rings are free,

21:24.717 --> 21:27.018
but the groom
is imprisoned forever.

21:28.153 --> 21:30.221
I know how he feels.
You know what they say.

21:30.223 --> 21:32.657
You got to crack
a few eggs to, uh...

21:32.659 --> 21:34.392
make an Amish.

21:35.594 --> 21:36.894
It's an egg.

21:36.896 --> 21:38.596
It's an Amish person.

21:38.598 --> 21:40.898
My uncle is on fire.

21:40.900 --> 21:43.334
So, you've seen a rabbit
pulled out of a hat,

21:43.336 --> 21:47.138
but have you ever seen
a hat pulled out of a rabbit?

21:48.240 --> 21:49.507
No, no!

21:49.509 --> 21:51.475
<i>Oh, my...</i>
<i>Okay, this date is over.</i>

21:51.477 --> 21:55.079
