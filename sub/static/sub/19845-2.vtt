09:21.563 --> 09:22.862
All right.

09:22.864 --> 09:25.798
(grunts)

09:25.800 --> 09:28.678
Oh. Oh fuck.

09:42.350 --> 09:44.316
♪ ♪

09:49.126 --> 09:50.755
Male voice: Wake up, boy. Come on now.

09:50.757 --> 09:51.857
Get up, boy.

09:51.859 --> 09:54.359
Jacob. Jacob. Come to. Here we go.

09:54.361 --> 09:55.994
There you go, buddy.

09:55.996 --> 09:58.196
Eww! Come on, man. Are you serious?

09:58.198 --> 10:00.031
What? Where am I?

10:00.033 --> 10:01.466
There's no time to explain.

10:01.468 --> 10:03.934
We have a very big
date to get to, Jacob,

10:03.936 --> 10:05.636
that I personally cannot miss.

10:05.638 --> 10:07.105
I don't know what's going on.

10:07.107 --> 10:09.440
My name's Wild Capper. Nice to meet you.

10:09.442 --> 10:10.907
I'm gonna kick things off for you

10:10.909 --> 10:12.509
and really get the gears going, okay?

10:12.511 --> 10:13.610
Let's start moving, buddy.

10:13.612 --> 10:16.179
- (thunder crashes)
- (gasps) What the shit is that?

10:16.181 --> 10:19.249
Come now, Jacob. You're not
prepared to face what's coming.

10:19.251 --> 10:20.884
Hurry, boy. Come on, follow me.

10:20.886 --> 10:23.186
- All right, I'm coming. Oh!
- (thunder crashes)

10:24.323 --> 10:26.056
Natalie, Hi.

10:26.058 --> 10:27.789
How are you, honey?
I'm so sorry I'm late.

10:27.791 --> 10:29.025
- What the fuck is this?
- So sorry, baby.

10:29.027 --> 10:31.193
Do not tell me you brought
one of your missions with you.

10:31.195 --> 10:32.995
- For fuck's sake, Anthony.
- He dropped into my lap.

10:32.997 --> 10:34.430
You know what my work is.

10:34.432 --> 10:36.932
- And your work is more important than me?
- Nothing's been more import...

10:36.934 --> 10:38.901
Oh, okay, nothing's ever
been more important than me.

10:38.903 --> 10:40.536
What about the mushroom person

10:40.538 --> 10:41.670
- you were sleeping with?
- How many

10:41.672 --> 10:42.905
times do we have to go over this?

10:42.907 --> 10:45.006
Mushroom people have psychic powers.

10:45.008 --> 10:47.108
I was under its little spell.

10:47.110 --> 10:50.311
There's one now! Stop looking
at me! You're not gonna do it!

10:50.313 --> 10:52.287
Fuck you, bitch! You're
just pissed because

10:52.290 --> 10:54.082
mushroom people give the best blowjobs!

10:54.084 --> 10:56.151
- Look into my eyes!
- I'm not doing it!

10:56.153 --> 10:57.385
Look into my eyes!

10:57.387 --> 10:59.487
I'm not gonna fall for
it again! You hear me?

10:59.489 --> 11:01.355
Go back underground where you belong!

11:01.357 --> 11:04.058
That's fucking racist.
That is fucking racist!

11:04.060 --> 11:05.794
- Fuck you!
- Okay, okay, what

11:05.797 --> 11:07.661
the shit is going on here?

11:07.663 --> 11:10.164
Who are you people? Am I dead?

11:10.166 --> 11:12.566
Jesus fucking Christ. Here's the deal.

11:12.568 --> 11:15.102
You're on a spirit quest...
Facing your demons,

11:15.104 --> 11:18.571
- overcoming obstacles, et cetera.
- Spirit quest?

11:18.573 --> 11:21.607
So, all you gotta do is just
follow your heart and do your best.

11:21.609 --> 11:23.943
Can you hear me, buddy?
Am I coming through clear?

11:23.945 --> 11:25.311
- Uh...
- So cool.

11:25.313 --> 11:26.912
Anyway, where did I leave off?

11:26.914 --> 11:28.647
Natalie, I'm just gonna say this.

11:28.649 --> 11:32.017
I have not cum since you left me,
out of respect to you.

11:32.019 --> 11:33.786
Anthony, you need to move
on, okay? You are obsessed.

11:33.788 --> 11:35.887
Okay, I'm getting under the
table. Just step on my balls.

11:35.889 --> 11:38.090
- Please, just step on my balls.
- You know what? I'm outta here.

11:38.092 --> 11:39.691
- (rumbling, shattering)
- All right.

11:39.693 --> 11:42.794
Jacob, listen to me. Find
the best baker in the village.

11:42.796 --> 11:45.230
- Best baker?
- Buy a Key lime pie from him.

11:45.232 --> 11:48.100
It will contain a key
for a castle on the hill.

11:48.102 --> 11:50.402
That's where you'll find
your princess being held.

11:50.404 --> 11:52.003
- Princess?
- Go, Jacob, go.

11:52.005 --> 11:54.671
Get the fuck outta here, Jacob!
Go! What are you waiting for?

11:54.673 --> 11:56.440
- (whimpering)
- (thunder crashes)

11:59.412 --> 12:01.145
Oh. "Bakery."

12:01.147 --> 12:03.080
Okay. Pretty straightforward.

12:03.082 --> 12:04.681
Clear signage.

12:04.683 --> 12:05.616
(bell jingles)

12:05.618 --> 12:08.486
Oh, a customer. Hello.
(chuckles nervously)

12:08.488 --> 12:12.989
Hello, sir. May I have a Key lime pie?

12:12.991 --> 12:15.425
Yeah. Here you go, one Key lime pie.

12:15.427 --> 12:17.193
Mmm. (eating noisily)

12:19.063 --> 12:21.697
Oh. What the shit? Where's
the freaking key, man?

12:21.699 --> 12:25.201
The Wild Capper told me the best bakery
in town would have a freaking key!

12:25.203 --> 12:27.202
The best baker? Me? Oh, no, no.

12:27.204 --> 12:30.272
I'm the bad baker. The
good baker is next door.

12:30.274 --> 12:32.508
- (fanfare plays)
- (chattering)

12:32.510 --> 12:34.876
You came into what used
to be the good baker,

12:34.878 --> 12:36.811
that was when my dad ran the place.

12:36.813 --> 12:39.681
I tried to carry on his legacy, but...

12:39.683 --> 12:41.483
I'm not doing a great job. (laughs)

12:41.485 --> 12:43.184
I want to be a painter, actually.

12:43.186 --> 12:46.554
What do you think of "Multiple
Pieces of Fruit in a Bowl"?

12:46.556 --> 12:47.755
That's the title of this one.

12:47.757 --> 12:49.757
Oh, I don't know. Your hand's unsteady,

12:49.759 --> 12:51.359
and it lacks any real perspective.

12:51.361 --> 12:53.528
Clearly you studied
Cézanne too closely.

12:53.530 --> 12:55.630
(stammers) Don't... don't leave.

12:55.632 --> 12:58.366
- Let go of my head.
- Look, I can give you the key.

12:58.368 --> 12:59.459
- What?
- Yeah, all-all

12:59.462 --> 13:01.067
bakers have the baker key.

13:01.069 --> 13:02.439
Okay, just give me the key.

13:02.442 --> 13:04.671
Well, you also have to
pay for those pies.

13:04.673 --> 13:07.607
I'm on a vision quest.
I didn't bring my wallet.

13:07.609 --> 13:09.876
(sighs) Another kick in the pants.

13:09.878 --> 13:11.478
All right, I'll give you a deal.

13:11.480 --> 13:13.246
I need some documents notarized.

13:13.248 --> 13:16.049
Bring 'em to the town accountants,
Finkledoink and Feinstein,

13:16.051 --> 13:19.518
bring them back to me, and
then you shall receive the key!

13:19.520 --> 13:21.753
(groans) I hate chores.

13:21.755 --> 13:25.624
Hey, look, it's not easy to
keep this bakery going, okay,

13:25.626 --> 13:29.295
- because I'm not my father.
- I'm already gone.

13:29.297 --> 13:32.964
All right, on my way.
Hopefully nothing stops me.

13:32.966 --> 13:36.133
(yelps) Whoa, a fox.

13:36.135 --> 13:38.002
Hey there, little guy.

13:38.971 --> 13:41.706
Oh, you want me to follow you?

13:41.708 --> 13:44.342
Oh, well, I would, but
I'm currently on a mission

13:44.344 --> 13:46.244
to get some documents notarized,

13:46.246 --> 13:48.979
and I wanna be responsible
in my fantasy world.

13:48.981 --> 13:51.748
But your way looks
pretty cool, too, huh?

13:51.750 --> 13:55.452
Hmm. Which way should I go?

13:55.454 --> 13:58.988
Should I go to a cool path with this fox

13:58.990 --> 14:01.525
or to the accountants' office?

14:02.528 --> 14:05.762
Okay, I'll go to the
accountants' office.

14:05.764 --> 14:08.231
Good luck. Bye!

16:03.408 --> 16:05.675
Hello, young man. Come in! Come in.

16:05.677 --> 16:07.776
Come, sit, sit, sit, sit.
Sit down. Sit down.

16:07.778 --> 16:10.278
My name is Finkledoink.
This is my cohort.

16:10.280 --> 16:11.588
- Feinstein.
- We understand

16:11.591 --> 16:13.114
you're on a journey quest.

16:13.116 --> 16:14.451
Let's not make a
<i>megillah</i> out of a molehill.

16:14.453 --> 16:16.952
You'd like to get some documents
notarized. Is that correct?

16:16.954 --> 16:21.156
Uh, yeah, but this just
feels a little dated to me.

16:21.158 --> 16:22.424
What? That's nonsense.

16:22.426 --> 16:24.525
- Both: It's nonsense.
- Ya little boychick.

16:24.527 --> 16:26.160
- Ya little <i>faygala.</i>
- Ya <i>fershlugina.</i>

16:26.162 --> 16:28.863
Ya little <i>schmutzig.</i> Ya got
some <i>schmutz</i> on your face.

16:28.865 --> 16:31.232

we, Feinstein?

16:31.234 --> 16:33.267
(both vocalizing music)

16:33.269 --> 16:37.071
Oh... no. Is this my subconscious?

16:37.073 --> 16:38.439
Am I a racist?

16:38.441 --> 16:40.453
Okay, okay, okay, okay,
okay. I get the <i>schtick.</i>

16:40.456 --> 16:43.410
- All right, all right. Enough. Enough already.
- Calm down. All right, okay. Calm down.

16:43.412 --> 16:45.445
Jacob, my boy, we can
notarize this for you.

16:45.447 --> 16:49.082
- Okay, good.
- But first, we have a series of tasks,

16:49.084 --> 16:50.350
we'd like you to undergo.

16:50.352 --> 16:51.985
Can you do that, my little boychick?

16:51.987 --> 16:54.855
- Sure, whatever.
- My bright and shining star.

16:54.857 --> 16:57.591
Okay, initial here, Jacob. Sign here.

16:57.593 --> 16:59.291
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
- Right here.

16:59.293 --> 17:01.059
Now, are you single? Are you married?

17:01.061 --> 17:03.629
- Currently looking.
- Okay, you can initial right here.

17:03.631 --> 17:05.798
- You want to circle which one.
- Okay.

17:05.800 --> 17:09.067
- Okay, you drew a square. That's fine.
- All right. I'm done.

17:09.069 --> 17:11.103
- Well, hold on. Let's look it over.
- Take a look.

17:11.105 --> 17:12.938
- He initialed there.
- He signed there.

17:12.940 --> 17:15.007
(accountants hawking)

17:15.009 --> 17:17.942
Wow. This couldn't get more offensive.

17:17.944 --> 17:21.311
- (clears throat)
- Both: Notary!

17:21.314 --> 17:22.446
♪ Well... ♪

17:22.449 --> 17:25.817
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

17:25.819 --> 17:27.852
(whimpers) Okay, guys, thanks again.

17:27.854 --> 17:29.521
- It's another one! Quick!
- Grab the money!

17:29.523 --> 17:31.556
- Finkledoink, quick!
- Grab the jewelry.

17:31.558 --> 17:33.056
(whimpers)

17:33.058 --> 17:35.659
- (grunts)
- Baker: Jacob!

17:35.661 --> 17:37.895
Hey, I was just doing a little...

17:37.897 --> 17:39.930
one-way bungee jumping. (chuckles)

17:39.932 --> 17:41.598
- What?
- I was gonna kill myself.

17:41.600 --> 17:43.233
Oh shit, you got it notarized?

17:43.235 --> 17:45.702
Yeah, I did everything you
asked. Just give me the key.

17:45.704 --> 17:47.871
I want to get out of
here and get my princess.

17:47.873 --> 17:49.906
You are very brave, Jacob,

17:49.908 --> 17:53.375
and so I shall bestow upon you

17:53.377 --> 17:55.545
the baker's key.

17:55.547 --> 17:58.648
Hey, man, that's a
cookie. I need a real key.

17:58.650 --> 18:00.349
That's the key you want. That's it.

18:00.351 --> 18:02.752
This is a fairytale
land, so keys are cookies,

18:02.754 --> 18:05.822
underwear is edible, mushroom
people give the best blowjobs.

18:05.824 --> 18:09.223
It's a weird place. Look at
this noose. It's just licorice.

18:09.225 --> 18:11.726
(chuckles) This is not the
first time I've tried this.

18:11.728 --> 18:12.794
Jacob: Ooh! Nerds Rope.

18:12.796 --> 18:14.162
I am going to hit the ground,

18:14.164 --> 18:16.086
and then just sadly eat an entire

18:16.089 --> 18:18.066
- licorice noose.
- See ya. Buh-bye.

18:18.068 --> 18:19.300
Ugh.

18:19.302 --> 18:20.469
(grunts)

18:21.738 --> 18:23.637
You know, you can't kill yourself here,

18:23.639 --> 18:25.906
but the licorice is pretty good.

18:26.843 --> 18:28.742

18:28.744 --> 18:30.478
- (rain pattering)
- (thunder crashes)

18:30.480 --> 18:32.145
Come on, you can do it, man.

18:32.147 --> 18:34.014
(whimpering)

18:34.866 --> 18:36.416
Female (in ghostly voice): This way.

18:36.418 --> 18:38.719
Princess? I can hear her!

18:38.721 --> 18:40.487
Princess: Over here.

18:40.489 --> 18:42.589
It's making me stronger!

18:42.591 --> 18:45.391
I'm coming for you, baby!

18:45.393 --> 18:47.426
(grunting)

18:47.428 --> 18:49.796
(panting)

18:51.500 --> 18:53.867
What? No! No!

18:53.869 --> 18:57.636
Freaking baker! Fuck this shit.

18:57.638 --> 19:01.306
I'm sick of running.
I'm freaking tired of it!

19:01.308 --> 19:02.975
- (thunder crashes)
- You want a piece of me?

19:02.977 --> 19:07.045
I'm Jacob fucking Luciano,
and I'll skull-fuck you!

19:07.047 --> 19:09.915
Come on, shitbag! Come on!

19:09.917 --> 19:12.117
- (angelic chorus)
- (gasps)

19:12.119 --> 19:14.252
Miles: I told you you
were brave, big bro.

19:14.254 --> 19:16.721
Oh. Miles.

19:16.723 --> 19:19.924
Jacob, this journey was a lesson,

19:19.926 --> 19:22.560
a lesson about facing your past.

19:22.562 --> 19:23.928
Okay, that makes sense.

19:23.930 --> 19:27.197
See, the Capper, he was
obsessed with his ex-wife,

19:27.199 --> 19:29.266
instead of realizing that perhaps

19:29.268 --> 19:30.935
their love had run its course.

19:30.937 --> 19:33.302
The baker, he was so focused

19:33.304 --> 19:35.204
on carrying his father's legacy out,

19:35.206 --> 19:37.073
that he never pursued his own.

19:37.075 --> 19:38.942
Finkledoink and Feinstein,

19:38.944 --> 19:42.211
while crazy offensive,
are lessons in history,

19:42.213 --> 19:45.148
Oh, thank God. They served a purpose.

19:45.150 --> 19:46.716
Man, people would love to edit out

19:46.718 --> 19:48.651
the nasty parts of Dickens and Twain...

19:48.653 --> 19:51.520
Heck, even Disney... But we can't.

19:51.522 --> 19:54.389
We must learn from our past.

19:54.391 --> 19:57.426
We must face the past.

19:57.428 --> 19:59.929
I'm sorry I was mean to you, Miles.

19:59.931 --> 20:02.865
I'm sorry I told you to go
out onto the train track.

20:02.867 --> 20:05.833
I was jealous, but I was really wrong.

20:05.835 --> 20:08.269
Hey, it's okay, big bro.

20:08.271 --> 20:11.973
- I'm free now.
- Whoa. Oh.

20:11.975 --> 20:14.375
(gasps) He's weightless.

20:14.377 --> 20:16.778
- Hey, sweetie. What's your name?
- Angela.

20:16.780 --> 20:17.946
You too?

20:17.948 --> 20:19.981
What you guys think about
having a birdbath together?

20:19.983 --> 20:21.749
- Yeah, I'd love to. Let's get out of here.
- Okay, Miles.

20:21.751 --> 20:23.784
Miles: Cleanliness is next to godliness.

20:23.786 --> 20:25.518
See ya, Miles.

20:25.520 --> 20:28.622
I did it. I completed the journey.

20:28.624 --> 20:30.390
So sick. So dope.

20:30.392 --> 20:32.025
Oh yeah, and, Jacob,

20:32.027 --> 20:34.094

Well, I'm not too sure
if that's appropriate.

20:57.517 --> 21:02.186
I'm married, and you're a

21:02.188 --> 21:04.155

(laughs) He really didn't use
me to the fullest potential here.

When I was out doing
community service with Miles,

I told him to get a
penny on the middle track.

Miles went out and before I knew it,

22:28.503 --> 22:31.671
the train came. I... I killed him.

I killed my brother. I killed your son.

we've had die on us?

22:58.965 --> 23:00.431
- (laughs uncomfortably)
- (laughs) Yeah, right.

23:00.433 --> 23:03.868
Jacob, take a guess at how many
kids we've had before you and Miles.

23:03.870 --> 23:04.936
Uh... two?

23:04.938 --> 23:07.371
- Fifty-four.
- Let's see. There was a stop sign.

put him. Human heroine.

- Mike: Bored to death.

23:15.680 --> 23:17.413
- James Cordon.
- Loose roller coaster strap,

23:17.415 --> 23:19.816

good time. Gang violence.

23:19.818 --> 23:22.385

less than special, honey.

23:36.367 --> 23:38.100
Wow. I guess you're right.

23:38.102 --> 23:41.303
(laughs) Yup. And look,
honey, just to reiterate,

23:41.305 --> 23:42.504
you will die someday.

23:42.506 --> 23:44.339
I will die, your father will die,

23:44.341 --> 23:46.242
everyone you know will die. (laughs)
