00:15.849 --> 00:17.142
[narrator] <i>Conspiracy!</i>

00:17.225 --> 00:20.186
<i>After repeated setbacks</i>
<i>on the planet Anaxes,</i>

00:20.270 --> 00:22.772
<i>an elite clone squad</i>
<i>is deployed to investigate</i>

00:22.856 --> 00:25.358
<i>the Separatists' tactical advantage.</i>

00:25.442 --> 00:28.069
<i>This special unit, called the Bad Batch,</i>

00:28.153 --> 00:30.363
<i>infiltrates Admiral Trench's Cyber Center</i>

00:30.447 --> 00:32.574
<i>to steal a strategic algorithm</i>

00:32.657 --> 00:35.493
<i>capable of predicting</i>
<i>the Republic's every move.</i>

00:36.119 --> 00:37.662
<i>What our heroes found</i>

00:37.746 --> 00:41.124
<i>was a live signal</i>
<i>from the ARC trooper known as Echo,</i>

00:41.207 --> 00:44.210
<i>a clone long believed to be dead.</i>

00:59.559 --> 01:03.396
[Hunter] Word is the general staff
isn't completely behind this mission.

01:03.480 --> 01:07.484
I admit the idea that Echo
is still alive is a long shot.

01:07.567 --> 01:09.819
I'm sure the Council
will approve the mission.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.613
Just remember the primary goal

01:11.696 --> 01:14.491
is to learn how the Separatists
are predicting our strategy,

01:14.574 --> 01:16.284
whether it's Echo behind it or not.

01:16.701 --> 01:19.788
Well, if you want my opinion,
sounds like a trap,

01:19.871 --> 01:24.417
but me and the boys will tag along anyway,
if only to say "I told you so."

01:24.918 --> 01:26.461
Just make sure you're ready

01:26.544 --> 01:28.505
if we get the go-ahead
from General Kenobi.

01:28.588 --> 01:31.007
If you're certain
he'll approve the mission, why wait?

01:31.091 --> 01:35.428
-Let's get going.
-First, we have that thing to do.

01:35.512 --> 01:38.014
-Uh, what thing?
-You know.

01:38.723 --> 01:40.600
We don't have time for that, sir.

01:41.726 --> 01:43.061
Yes, we do.

01:44.396 --> 01:47.107
Well, I'll just let you two sort this out.

01:47.190 --> 01:49.776
I'll be waiting on the ship
with the rest of the team.

01:50.485 --> 01:52.445
Come on, Rex. I'm late as it is.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.603
[Padmé] <i>You're late again.</i>

02:28.481 --> 02:30.442
Padmé, I'm so sorry.

02:30.525 --> 02:33.570
We didn't anticipate
the Outer Rim Sieges would last this long.

02:33.653 --> 02:36.614
<i>That would be why</i>
<i>they call it a siege, Anakin.</i>

02:36.698 --> 02:38.366
I know, I just thought that I--

02:38.450 --> 02:43.329
<i>You thought you could bring a swift end</i>
<i>to the conflict single-handedly.</i>

02:44.039 --> 02:45.040
Yeah.

02:45.123 --> 02:49.669
[chuckles]
<i>Anakin, what you're doing is important.</i>

02:49.753 --> 02:54.966
<i>The Republic needs you on the front lines</i>
<i>just as they need my voice in the Senate.</i>

02:55.759 --> 02:56.760
I know.

03:10.690 --> 03:12.108
Oh, great.

03:15.653 --> 03:16.863
<i>What is it?</i>

03:17.280 --> 03:19.366
[sighs] Obi-Wan is coming.

03:20.492 --> 03:22.619
<i>No, that's not it.</i>

03:22.702 --> 03:24.204
<i>There's something else.</i>

03:25.997 --> 03:27.207
It's Rex.

03:27.290 --> 03:29.167
I'm worried he's letting
his personal feelings

03:29.250 --> 03:31.127
drive him too much on this mission.

03:31.961 --> 03:34.255
<i>I wonder where he learned that.</i>

03:35.173 --> 03:36.174
[scoffs]

03:37.926 --> 03:39.344
Rex, where's Anakin?

03:39.427 --> 03:41.179
I need to speak to him about this mission.

03:41.262 --> 03:43.348
Well, General, he's, um...

03:43.431 --> 03:45.642
Well, he's inside your barracks, isn't he?

03:45.725 --> 03:46.851
Yes, sir.

03:47.477 --> 03:48.853
What's going on here?

03:49.270 --> 03:50.271
Nothing, sir.

03:50.355 --> 03:53.024
I was just waiting for the General...
uh, General.

03:54.401 --> 03:57.070
You'll have to do
better than that, Captain.

03:57.946 --> 04:00.073
<i>You've known Rex a long time.</i>

04:00.865 --> 04:06.162
<i>When you throw caution to the wind</i>
<i>and take chances, where is he?</i>

04:06.663 --> 04:07.997
Right beside me.

04:08.748 --> 04:12.293
<i>Then maybe that's where you should be</i>
<i>for him, Ani.</i>

04:12.794 --> 04:16.423
<i>Trust his instincts like he trusts yours.</i>

04:16.881 --> 04:19.175
I'm just trying to look out for him.

04:20.010 --> 04:21.302
<i>I know you are.</i>

04:24.014 --> 04:25.390
<i>I love you, Ani.</i>

04:25.807 --> 04:26.808
[sighs]

04:27.392 --> 04:28.393
I love you too.

04:31.021 --> 04:33.314
Then what is Anakin doing in there?

04:33.398 --> 04:37.068
Ah, he's spot-checking my gear, sir.

04:37.152 --> 04:39.279
Really? Without you?

04:39.362 --> 04:40.822
Well...

04:41.781 --> 04:43.033
Here you go, Rex.

04:43.116 --> 04:44.784
-And try not to break it again.
-Anakin.

04:44.868 --> 04:47.370
About this mission, the Council thinks--

04:47.454 --> 04:49.330
That it's a good idea? I agree.

04:49.414 --> 04:50.707
Let's get moving, Rex.

04:50.790 --> 04:51.791
No, wait. That's not--

04:51.875 --> 04:52.959
[Anakin] No time.

04:54.586 --> 04:57.255
I hope you at least told Padmé
I said hello.

05:24.074 --> 05:27.077
So, how many missions
has your team been on, Sergeant?

05:27.660 --> 05:30.413
Honestly, sir, I've lost count.

05:30.497 --> 05:32.874
All the action sort of blurs together.

05:33.958 --> 05:38.254
I know you work with Cody sometimes,
but who do you guys report to?

05:38.755 --> 05:41.299
Hmm... good question.

05:41.383 --> 05:43.301
Can't say I've got an answer.

05:43.968 --> 05:44.969
Yeah!

05:47.013 --> 05:49.224
We are approaching Skako Minor.

05:49.307 --> 05:51.434
It looks to be a difficult landing.

06:33.560 --> 06:36.354
Rex, what do we know about this place?

06:36.438 --> 06:40.358
On this part of Skako,
there's a race of locals, the Poletecs.

06:40.442 --> 06:43.028
All we know is they're very primitive.

06:43.111 --> 06:44.779
"Primitive" is being kind.

06:44.863 --> 06:48.283
My intel says
the Poletecs worship flying reptiles.

06:49.325 --> 06:50.952
[screeches]

06:51.036 --> 06:53.663
Oh! What the heck was that?

06:53.747 --> 06:54.998
It's one of those reptiles.

06:55.081 --> 06:56.916
I want that thing off my ship.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.252
Hold on! Hold on!
Don't just run out there.

07:11.056 --> 07:13.433
Hey! Get off of there!

07:13.516 --> 07:16.144
Hey, calm down. We need to talk to them.

07:16.644 --> 07:18.688
-Why?
-The General's right.

07:20.315 --> 07:21.399
Look out, Rex!

07:34.662 --> 07:36.081
I have a thermal reading.

07:36.164 --> 07:38.750
Point-two-five east, elevation 175.

07:39.167 --> 07:41.419
Relax. I'll handle this.

07:45.674 --> 07:47.050
What are you doing?

07:47.133 --> 07:48.760
Going for a ride.

08:49.904 --> 08:52.907
Tech, I'm with the General.
Hone in on my signal.

08:55.076 --> 08:58.079
[speaking alien language]

09:00.457 --> 09:01.708
[growls]

09:03.585 --> 09:05.587
-[speaking alien language]
-[grunts]

09:08.965 --> 09:11.134
[speaking alien language]

09:12.886 --> 09:16.806
Okay, I think we're gonna have
a slight communication problem here.

09:17.349 --> 09:20.352
[speaking alien language]

09:36.743 --> 09:39.245
That creature still has
a hold of the General.

09:44.793 --> 09:47.212
We're going in,
but remember what the General said.

09:47.295 --> 09:50.256
"No casualties, disarm only."

09:50.340 --> 09:51.758
We're on it, Captain.

09:51.841 --> 09:53.802
Wrecker, Crosshair, rockslide!

10:15.365 --> 10:17.575
[speaking alien language]

10:33.800 --> 10:35.593
[alien screeching]

10:37.220 --> 10:39.097
[speaking alien language]

10:40.932 --> 10:42.892
[speaking alien language]

10:45.729 --> 10:47.564
Tech, translate what he said.

10:55.697 --> 10:59.909
He says
he does not want our war on his planet.

11:00.452 --> 11:02.120
That is why he took our leader.

11:02.203 --> 11:04.039
We didn't bring the war here.

11:04.122 --> 11:06.124
It was Wat Tambor and the Separatists.

11:06.708 --> 11:12.547
[speaking alien language]

11:12.630 --> 11:14.007
...Separatists.

11:14.090 --> 11:15.091
[beeping]

11:16.009 --> 11:18.178
Tell him we apologize for what's happened.

11:18.261 --> 11:23.016
But tell him the enemy is holding
one of our men prisoner in Purkoll.

11:23.099 --> 11:27.228
As soon as we rescue him,
we'll leave his planet, for good.

11:29.022 --> 11:33.818
[speaking alien language]

11:43.620 --> 11:46.498
[speaking alien language]

11:47.499 --> 11:50.794
[speaking alien language]

11:50.877 --> 11:53.046
The chief says
he will provide us with scouts

11:53.129 --> 11:55.298
and lead us to Tambor's city.

11:55.382 --> 11:56.925
From there, we're on our own.

11:57.759 --> 12:00.053
Any help is better than no help.

12:06.267 --> 12:10.355
We are receiving a transmission
from Admiral Trench on Anaxes.

12:11.106 --> 12:12.190
Put him through.

12:13.316 --> 12:17.112
<i>Pardon the intrusion, Minister Tambor...</i>

12:18.321 --> 12:20.865
<i>but I have disturbing news.</i>

12:21.408 --> 12:23.618
You may proceed, Admiral.

12:24.994 --> 12:30.333
<i>An infiltration team of clones</i>
<i>has traced the algorithm signal to Skako.</i>

12:30.917 --> 12:34.421
<i>I believe your operation there</i>
<i>is in jeopardy.</i>

12:35.839 --> 12:39.092
The Republic would not dare attack us.

12:39.175 --> 12:42.929
The Techno Union has corporate neutrality.

12:43.013 --> 12:45.557
<i>From what I have seen,</i>

12:45.640 --> 12:49.352
<i>that would not matter</i>
<i>to these Republic operatives.</i>

12:51.271 --> 12:53.773
Then we shall be ready for them.

13:03.992 --> 13:05.827
[speaking alien language]

13:09.456 --> 13:11.291
Hope nobody's scared of heights.

13:13.710 --> 13:15.378
Well, I'm not scared of nothing.

13:15.462 --> 13:20.550
I just... When I'm up real high,
I got a problem with gravity.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.260
Speaking of problems,

13:22.344 --> 13:24.429
I am no longer picking up Echo's signal.

13:24.512 --> 13:26.890
I... I don't understand.

13:26.973 --> 13:28.808
You said it was coming from this city.

13:28.892 --> 13:30.393
I can only speculate,

13:30.477 --> 13:34.689
but it is possible there's a latency issue
with the frequency

13:34.773 --> 13:37.734
caused by all these
atmospheric disturbances.

13:38.151 --> 13:42.405
Or... maybe they sent the signal
to lure us into a trap.

13:42.489 --> 13:44.783
And maybe your friend's actually dead.

13:45.450 --> 13:47.494
Well, I can't be the only one
thinking of that.

13:47.577 --> 13:49.704
Look, every mission could be a trap.

13:49.788 --> 13:51.414
This one is no different.

13:51.498 --> 13:55.794
I'm telling you that signal is being sent
by Echo himself! He's alive!

13:56.211 --> 13:59.464
[Crosshair] I think you're letting
your personal feelings get in the way

13:59.547 --> 14:02.133
because you left him for dead
at the Citadel.

14:02.217 --> 14:04.094
I had no choice. You hear me?

14:04.177 --> 14:06.054
Oh, I don't blame you.

14:06.638 --> 14:08.682
I would've left him for dead too.

14:09.057 --> 14:11.976
Besides, he's just another reg.

14:13.395 --> 14:14.604
Hey!

14:15.313 --> 14:18.650
Why don't you pick on someone
not your size?

14:20.402 --> 14:22.696
You'll be a whole lot smaller
when I'm through with you.

14:23.655 --> 14:24.698
That's enough!

14:26.741 --> 14:30.078
Sergeant, take your men
and scout the area for a tower entrance.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.539
I want to talk to my Captain alone.

14:42.298 --> 14:45.301
Rex, I hate to say it, but...

14:45.719 --> 14:49.723
you have to prepare yourself
for the possibility that Echo is dead,

14:49.806 --> 14:51.891
and this is all a Separatist trick.

14:51.975 --> 14:56.271
Sir, I have watched so many of my brothers
fall during this war,

14:56.354 --> 14:58.815
and I try not to hang on
to any one of them.

14:58.898 --> 15:02.944
But that changed
when I heard that Separatist transmission.

15:03.028 --> 15:04.904
It was no algorithm.

15:04.988 --> 15:07.657
That was Echo's voice. I know it.

15:08.408 --> 15:09.743
I hope you're right.

15:09.826 --> 15:12.704
But if, for some reason, you're wrong...

15:12.787 --> 15:14.831
Then I'll deal with it.

15:18.001 --> 15:20.378
[wind howling]

15:37.145 --> 15:40.315
We're in business, General.
Tech regained Echo's signal.

15:40.398 --> 15:43.151
It's coming from this tower.
How's it going, Tech?

15:51.368 --> 15:52.786
Sorry it took so long.

15:53.536 --> 15:55.288
Hey, Crosshair, check it out.

15:59.042 --> 16:01.002
Yeah, it's a lift.

16:01.419 --> 16:03.046
Well, we already knew that.

16:03.838 --> 16:06.007
Wait, wait, wait. A lift?

16:06.466 --> 16:08.093
How far up are we going?

16:08.510 --> 16:12.222
Don't worry, Wrecker. I'll hold your hand.

16:12.305 --> 16:14.140
Hey! Cut it out, Sarge.

16:14.224 --> 16:16.142
Just give me some droids to crush.

16:22.732 --> 16:25.443
Remember, this is a stealth mission.

16:25.527 --> 16:28.321
No blasting, no blowing things up.

16:28.405 --> 16:29.698
Nobody knows we're here.

16:31.574 --> 16:32.701
[yells]

16:32.784 --> 16:34.619
Intruders! Attack!

16:38.206 --> 16:39.749
Why?

16:41.584 --> 16:43.586
So much for stealth.

17:05.984 --> 17:07.527
Yeah! Hah! Ha-ha!

17:07.610 --> 17:09.279
Yeah!

17:10.071 --> 17:14.034
Uh... sorry. I just got excited.

17:16.703 --> 17:18.788
I've still got a lock on Echo's signal.

17:19.789 --> 17:22.500
All right, men. Let's hunt some droids.

17:22.917 --> 17:25.670
Now you're talking! Yeah!

17:42.520 --> 17:45.106
Where exactly
is Echo's signal coming from?

17:45.190 --> 17:47.859
Strange. I just lost the signal.

17:47.942 --> 17:49.444
What? How can that be?

17:50.028 --> 17:52.655
There's no "atmospheric disturbances"
up here.

17:52.739 --> 17:54.240
Well, I have a new theory.

17:54.324 --> 17:56.826
I'm surprised
I did not consider it earlier.

17:56.910 --> 18:00.413
The signal is only traceable
during data transmissions.

18:00.497 --> 18:04.668
So until Echo dispenses more intel,
I cannot pick up the signal.

18:04.751 --> 18:07.045
Okay, we're splitting up.

18:07.128 --> 18:08.588
Search every door.

18:08.672 --> 18:11.132
If someone finds Echo, contact the others.

18:11.216 --> 18:14.761
We go in together,
just in case there's trouble.

18:33.697 --> 18:35.323
Drop your weapon!

18:35.407 --> 18:37.200
You are surrounded!

18:49.838 --> 18:51.840
Ah! It appears the signal is back.

18:53.133 --> 18:54.426
It's from up ahead.

18:59.222 --> 19:01.016
In there.

19:16.114 --> 19:17.699
Tech, open this door.

19:21.369 --> 19:24.372
<i>You clones are so predictable.</i>

19:24.873 --> 19:26.541
Wat Tambor.

19:26.624 --> 19:32.547
<i>Your algorithm predicted nearly every move</i>
<i>you made to infiltrate Purkoll.</i>

19:32.630 --> 19:34.382
There is no algorithm.

19:34.841 --> 19:37.010
We know you're holding
a prisoner of war here.

19:37.385 --> 19:40.805
<i>Prisoner?</i>
<i>I don't know what you mean, Captain.</i>

19:40.889 --> 19:44.184
I am leaving here with my friend.

19:44.267 --> 19:46.519
<i>Your friend is dead.</i>

19:46.603 --> 19:48.772
<i>His mind is ours.</i>

19:49.439 --> 19:50.440
Liar!

19:54.986 --> 19:56.654
<i>Execute them.</i>

20:46.955 --> 20:49.582
Tech, open that door for Rex!

20:49.666 --> 20:50.667
Yes, sir!

20:51.167 --> 20:53.503
I hope you find
what you're looking for, Captain.

21:17.193 --> 21:19.612
I don't like the look of this.

21:26.494 --> 21:28.455
I'm definitely picking up a life-form
in there.

21:28.997 --> 21:31.291
It seems to be a stasis chamber.

21:31.916 --> 21:33.543
I think I can get it open.

21:48.641 --> 21:50.518
Echo. Tech.

21:51.102 --> 21:52.479
We got to get him out of here.

21:52.562 --> 21:55.648
Figure out how to unplug him from--
from this mess.

22:02.530 --> 22:04.532
What have they done to you?

22:04.616 --> 22:09.162
We-- We have to get to the shuttle
to escape the Citadel.

22:09.245 --> 22:11.456
-No! I'll go first.
-Echo.

22:11.539 --> 22:14.501
-No! No. No.
-Echo, it's Rex. I'm here.

22:14.584 --> 22:15.585
No.

22:16.378 --> 22:20.465
Rex? You, you came back for me.

22:21.341 --> 22:23.593
Yes. Yes, I did.

22:24.219 --> 22:25.220
What?

22:25.679 --> 22:28.848
What happened? Where am I?

22:29.182 --> 22:32.060
It's okay, Echo. You're safe now.

22:32.686 --> 22:33.937
Just sit tight, trooper.

22:35.021 --> 22:36.398
You're going home.

22:48.743 --> 22:52.455
