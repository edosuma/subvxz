00:27.300 --> 00:33.240
I should drink out of this
afternoon's heart

00:33.340 --> 00:36.480
So I fall asleep

00:36.580 --> 00:41.561
Before I go dark

00:44.780 --> 00:47.280
Back in

00:47.380 --> 00:50.480
Pouring rage

00:50.580 --> 00:55.685
I fell throwing up

00:58.860 --> 01:04.069
I can't shake it away

01:06.720 --> 01:11.641
Luck is like a marble

01:12.460 --> 01:16.406
On the stage

01:17.896 --> 01:20.669
It waits

01:22.540 --> 01:26.280
For our big break

01:26.380 --> 01:29.036
To fall

01:45.500 --> 01:49.460
The following Brooklyn-bound "L" train

01:49.560 --> 01:54.190
will depart in approximately
seven minutes.

01:55.260 --> 02:00.220
Why did you fly away?

02:00.320 --> 02:05.880
I've been dying a little death
since that very day

02:05.980 --> 02:09.300
I used to laugh

02:09.400 --> 02:12.248
when you told me

04:58.540 --> 04:59.926
Hello?

05:01.500 --> 05:04.680
- Hello?
- Franny.

05:04.980 --> 05:07.720
- Mom?
- Franny.

05:08.020 --> 05:09.723
Mom?

05:10.140 --> 05:11.474
Hello?

05:11.780 --> 05:15.760
Your brother was in an accident.

05:15.860 --> 05:18.760
He's in the hospital.

05:18.860 --> 05:20.849
You need to come home.

06:14.140 --> 06:16.059
The impact occurred in
what's called the Pterion,

06:16.159 --> 06:18.320
an especially vulnerable part
of the skull.

06:18.420 --> 06:21.938
You see this bright biconvex region here
that looks like a lens?

06:22.820 --> 06:26.540
This is what we call a hematoma to the
brain tissue, a sort of blood clot...

06:26.640 --> 06:30.201
Can you just tell me
if he's gonna be okay?

06:33.220 --> 06:36.600
I have to tell you,
he might never come out of this.

06:36.700 --> 06:40.078
We can't really say for sure.
In these situations,

06:40.178 --> 06:44.604
we have no recourse
other than to be patient and wait.

07:05.160 --> 07:07.660
You cut off all your hair.

07:08.100 --> 07:09.668
Not all.

07:11.040 --> 07:13.260
I loved it long.

07:13.360 --> 07:15.098
I wanted a change.

07:17.040 --> 07:20.600
Taxi driver's name is Rumnesh.

07:20.700 --> 07:24.260
He has a wife and two kids.

07:24.360 --> 07:27.700
They think he tried to stop
the car in time,

07:27.800 --> 07:29.260
but Henry had his headphones on,

07:29.360 --> 07:33.060
and I guess he didn't look
when he was crossing.

07:33.160 --> 07:35.680
I haven't been paying attention.

07:35.780 --> 07:38.660
He's been, just,
living somewhere in Brooklyn.

07:38.760 --> 07:42.460
He comes home sometimes to do his laundry,
but it's all about music for him,

07:42.560 --> 07:46.420
and I've been trying to finish
the book and just...

07:47.120 --> 07:49.740
You couldn't have stopped him
from crossing the street.

07:49.840 --> 07:53.953
I always told him to look both ways.

07:54.400 --> 07:58.860
You just do your best, you know?
You just do your best.

08:03.720 --> 08:08.180
Thankfully your father
isn't alive to see all this.

08:08.280 --> 08:11.702
It's just a lot for us
to handle, you know?

08:21.520 --> 08:24.900
You're gonna
have to sleep in Henry's room.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.600
There's so many boxes in your room.

08:28.700 --> 08:32.774
- It's okay. I'll just move the boxes.
- No, I gave your bed to Sylvia.

08:36.700 --> 08:38.299
Who's Sylvia?

08:38.400 --> 08:41.059
She delivers the mail.

08:41.159 --> 08:44.078
- Why'd you give her my bed?
- Because...

08:44.443 --> 08:48.980
you know, I asked her if she wanted a bed,
and she seemed so happy,

08:49.080 --> 08:54.280
and you're never here, Franny.
I mean, you haven't lived here in years,

08:54.380 --> 08:56.760
and you always complained
about that mattress anyway,

08:56.960 --> 09:02.220
- so just don't get all bent out of shape.
- I'm not bent out of shape.

10:07.700 --> 10:09.864
Hey, Franny, I...

10:16.300 --> 10:20.440
I know you're busy, and I know
you think this is a waste of time.

10:20.540 --> 10:22.640
I'm not sure if you've listened
to anything else I've sent,

10:22.740 --> 10:26.660
but here's another song I just finished,

10:27.060 --> 10:29.860
probably the first one
I'm really proud of.

10:29.960 --> 10:32.369
I hope you listen to it.

10:48.540 --> 10:52.060
I have walked so much farther

10:52.160 --> 10:53.880
I thought

10:53.980 --> 10:59.200
I should drink out
of this afternoon's heart

10:59.300 --> 11:01.740
So I fall asleep

11:01.840 --> 11:05.861
Before I go dark

11:12.340 --> 11:14.282
Henry.

11:14.940 --> 11:16.881
I don't really...

11:19.240 --> 11:20.989
I don't...

11:21.740 --> 11:23.880
I don't really know

11:23.980 --> 11:26.328
what to do now.

12:13.140 --> 12:14.166
Fuck!

12:26.900 --> 12:30.640
It waits

12:30.740 --> 12:33.960
For our big break

12:34.060 --> 12:36.537
To fall

13:39.220 --> 13:41.402
Okay. Enjoy.

14:20.780 --> 14:23.144
James Forester!

14:26.020 --> 14:27.888
James Forester!

14:30.620 --> 14:32.051
Hey.

14:35.740 --> 14:37.686
Hello, New York.

14:51.260 --> 14:55.060
You got your little hearts and

14:56.460 --> 14:59.838
Waitin' for the dawn

15:01.220 --> 15:04.960
You've been brainstormin'

15:05.060 --> 15:07.560
By my place

15:07.660 --> 15:10.160
In the sun

15:10.260 --> 15:14.040
And my bulb went black

15:14.140 --> 15:18.308
And a thousand diamondbacks

15:18.408 --> 15:21.000
Came slitherin'

15:21.100 --> 15:23.771
And hummin'

15:27.220 --> 15:31.164
We build a little bonfire

15:32.340 --> 15:35.757
By the two cent bridge

15:37.220 --> 15:40.701
You were dreaming of the crossing

15:41.100 --> 15:43.520
I was staring

15:43.620 --> 15:45.442
At the edge

15:46.040 --> 15:49.703
And my jaw went slack

15:49.803 --> 15:54.000
And a thousand razorbacks

15:54.100 --> 15:56.500
Came chargin'

15:56.600 --> 15:59.790
Screamin'

17:53.600 --> 17:55.640
Thank you, Forester.

17:55.740 --> 17:57.190
Take care.

18:00.620 --> 18:02.161
Thank you.

18:14.300 --> 18:15.890
Thank you.

18:19.620 --> 18:20.746
- All right, man.
- Bye.

18:25.725 --> 18:27.345
- James?
- Hey.

18:29.320 --> 18:32.015
- I really liked the show.
- Thanks.

18:33.580 --> 18:36.389
My brother was hit by a car this week.

18:36.680 --> 18:38.980
I'm... I'm so sorry to hear that.

18:39.080 --> 18:42.200
Henry Ellis. You're his favorite.

18:42.300 --> 18:46.360
- Is he okay?
- He's at Memorial intensive care.

18:46.460 --> 18:48.960
- He's in a coma.
- Jesus, I'm so sorry.

18:49.060 --> 18:51.820
You don't remember him, do you?

18:51.920 --> 18:55.840
He sent a letter to you
or to your record label.

18:55.940 --> 18:58.440
The... yeah, the label
gets a lot of letters,

18:58.540 --> 19:02.635
and then it takes 'em a while
to get to me, so unfortunately...

19:02.735 --> 19:04.326
Okay. Okay.

19:05.300 --> 19:08.240
Well, I brought you something
he was working on.

19:08.340 --> 19:11.366
I thought... It's really good.

19:13.500 --> 19:14.954
I guess I'm not the only one.

19:16.460 --> 19:18.400
Thank you. Thanks so much.

19:18.500 --> 19:20.591
- It was nice to meet you.
- Same here.

19:20.691 --> 19:24.841
- I'm Franny, Franny Ellis.
- I hope Henry gets better.

19:26.500 --> 19:27.606
Thank you.

19:39.700 --> 19:42.513
Hey, I made you eggs.

19:42.860 --> 19:44.360
Thank you.

19:44.460 --> 19:46.891
I just... I can't...
I can't eat right now.

19:50.420 --> 19:53.905
Hey, how does this sound for a title?

19:54.100 --> 19:59.331
Mythological foundations:
Tales of Monkokobaka and the Dekay tribes.

19:59.884 --> 20:01.641
Sounds good.

20:07.060 --> 20:09.278
It's so pointless.

20:10.100 --> 20:12.800
How can I even do this right now?

20:12.900 --> 20:14.868
Okay, write.

20:52.940 --> 20:55.359
Fall

21:08.152 --> 21:09.774
Hey.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.020
All dead and gone

21:16.305 --> 21:19.349
All dead and gone

21:22.020 --> 21:26.480
My old man, my grandpap
First white man to the cumberland gap

21:26.580 --> 21:31.570
My old man, my grandpap
First white man to the cumberland gap

21:34.206 --> 21:36.248
Cumberland gap

21:38.580 --> 21:41.740
Cumberland gap
All dead and gone

21:41.840 --> 21:46.524
All dead and gone
All dead and gone

22:27.480 --> 22:29.728
- Hey.
- I was...

22:32.900 --> 22:34.363
Hi.

22:34.700 --> 22:37.280
I was just in the area and thought,

22:37.380 --> 22:41.340
maybe I'd just, you know, stop by.

22:41.914 --> 22:44.246
Didn't know if you liked sugar.

22:46.660 --> 22:47.590
Thank you.

22:49.520 --> 22:51.000
Thanks.

22:51.300 --> 22:53.209
I'm okay. Thank you.

23:07.980 --> 23:10.640
Aren't you really busy?

23:11.280 --> 23:13.300
Depends on how you define "busy."

23:13.400 --> 23:16.337
I guess I always think
of people like you having...

23:18.340 --> 23:22.760
Things lined up
every millisecond of the day...

23:22.860 --> 23:25.122
Back-to-back meetings
with important people.

23:28.700 --> 23:31.217
I listened to Henry's song.

23:31.860 --> 23:35.240
It's great. I mean, I liked it a lot.

23:35.340 --> 23:38.128
I know. It's really good, isn't it?

23:41.660 --> 23:44.600
You know, he would really flip out
if he knew you were here.

23:44.700 --> 23:46.944
He's kind of obsessed.

23:48.620 --> 23:52.880
Not like in a freaky way or anything,
just, you know.

23:53.737 --> 23:58.560
I could play him something if...
Not if... Not if you don't want me to.

23:58.660 --> 24:00.160
- I don't have to.
- No, no.

24:00.260 --> 24:05.160
That would be great.
I'm sure he would love that.

24:41.380 --> 24:43.897
Dressed in white cotton

24:45.060 --> 24:47.657
Staring at the phone

24:49.140 --> 24:51.708
I was hiding in the attic

24:53.020 --> 24:55.160
The day you left home

24:55.260 --> 24:59.600
Mother, I thought that you

24:59.700 --> 25:02.548
Turned back

25:03.500 --> 25:10.080
That that big black Cadillac

25:10.180 --> 25:12.568
Took you

25:20.780 --> 25:23.615
Mother, I see you

25:24.500 --> 25:27.655
But only in dreams

25:28.180 --> 25:31.528
You put me in a basket

25:32.180 --> 25:34.880
And you push me upstream

25:34.980 --> 25:38.441
But I'm always

25:38.760 --> 25:41.843
Driftin' back

25:42.860 --> 25:49.320
Where that big black Cadillac

25:49.420 --> 25:51.772
Took you

26:06.600 --> 26:07.801
Oh, mom.

26:10.340 --> 26:12.363
This is James Forester.

26:14.500 --> 26:16.720
The singer?

26:16.820 --> 26:18.160
Yeah.

26:18.825 --> 26:20.449
Thank you.

26:26.100 --> 26:28.620
Thank you so much for coming

26:29.220 --> 26:30.651
and for the tea.

26:30.751 --> 26:33.864
Please, this is the least I could do.

26:36.020 --> 26:37.843
Oh, sorry.

26:45.260 --> 26:50.760
I'm going to this place tonight... this club
Henry likes... If you want to come.

26:50.860 --> 26:55.120
I've never been there before,
but the... there's a show at 11:00,

26:55.220 --> 27:00.240
and I'm probably gonna go to this place
beforehand, this other place that he likes.

27:00.340 --> 27:02.720
You're probably really busy
with a lot of other things.

27:02.820 --> 27:04.840
I'm not... I'm not playing tonight,

27:04.940 --> 27:08.100
and I don't have any meetings
or anything then either.

27:08.200 --> 27:11.760
Oh, good. Yeah, I got it. Good. Okay.

27:11.860 --> 27:14.088
- Cool.
- Great.

27:16.500 --> 27:18.680
- Oh, where?
- What?

27:18.780 --> 27:20.080
The place.

27:21.532 --> 27:25.080
Berry and 11th...
North 11th in Williamsburg.

27:25.180 --> 27:26.760
- 9:00?
- Okay.

27:26.860 --> 27:28.041
Okay.

27:53.100 --> 27:55.409
Father is sleepin'

27:56.760 --> 28:00.000
Upright in his vest

28:00.100 --> 28:01.620
I brush away the ashes

28:01.720 --> 28:06.100
He's the only 19-year-old
I ever saw with a gramophone.

28:07.100 --> 28:09.580
He was telling me that it broke
a couple of weeks ago.

28:09.680 --> 28:12.700
You turn back

28:14.800 --> 28:21.140
That that big black Cadillac

28:21.240 --> 28:25.442
Is turnin' round

28:52.699 --> 28:55.820
Where does Henry sleep?

28:56.376 --> 28:57.620
It's right over there.

28:57.720 --> 28:59.451
- Here?
- Yeah.

29:25.780 --> 29:26.960
- Hey.
- Hi.

29:27.660 --> 29:28.972
Do you have a gramophone?

29:29.952 --> 29:34.860
No. Junk Market might
have one down by the B.Q.E.

29:36.060 --> 29:37.806
Thank you.

29:43.300 --> 29:44.638
What about keyboards?

29:44.738 --> 29:49.766
Yeah, we just got in
a vintage '59 Rigaledo.

29:51.220 --> 29:55.103
- Can I... Can I see it?
- Yeah, sure.

30:00.540 --> 30:04.113
Check this sweet thing out here.

30:55.060 --> 30:56.794
So...

31:00.320 --> 31:02.423
What's your deal?

31:04.700 --> 31:07.006
Well, I...

31:08.540 --> 31:11.960
I... Yeah, I put out
an album five years ago,

31:12.260 --> 31:17.483
bought me indie fame
and sort of fortune.

31:20.580 --> 31:22.721
I'm a libra.

31:24.100 --> 31:25.718
Go on.

31:26.480 --> 31:29.986
Okay. I...

31:30.380 --> 31:32.980
I live in a cabin in Maine.

31:33.080 --> 31:37.481
It's where I normally am
when I'm trying to be creative.

31:39.280 --> 31:41.840
I haven't really been able
to write much of anything

31:41.940 --> 31:44.857
since the last album, though.

31:46.340 --> 31:49.280
Last time, I mean with the album,

31:49.380 --> 31:55.057
it was easy. I just got
in my car and drove.

31:55.220 --> 31:59.360
Me and Tessa, my ex-girlfriend.
I mean, well, we...

31:59.460 --> 32:02.780
Yeah, we broke up about a year ago.
We were together a long time.

32:03.380 --> 32:05.080
She found someone else.

32:05.180 --> 32:07.458
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

32:08.520 --> 32:10.080
What about you?

32:10.580 --> 32:15.400
I'm getting my PhD in anthropology.
Nomadic tribes in Morocco are my specialty.

32:15.500 --> 32:20.929
Cool. It must be a lot
of work getting a PhD.

32:21.029 --> 32:24.240
I get to ask a lot of questions,

32:24.340 --> 32:27.680
and I listen to people.
It's a lot of reading.

32:33.980 --> 32:36.639
I've been reading Henry's journal.

32:38.420 --> 32:42.371
His... reading his most
private thoughts. I...

32:45.220 --> 32:47.230
I've been going to places he went to.

32:47.330 --> 32:50.040
I've started recording sounds
he might recognize.

32:50.140 --> 32:53.240
- It's just really messed up.
- You're his sister. I get it.

32:53.340 --> 32:58.160
We had a fight, like,
our first real adult fight, you know?

32:58.260 --> 32:59.859
He...

33:01.540 --> 33:04.640
He dropped out of college
to be a musician.

33:04.740 --> 33:08.440
I said I thought that
he was making a huge mistake.

33:08.540 --> 33:11.076
I said so many awful things.

33:12.420 --> 33:15.562
We haven't talked in six months.

33:19.540 --> 33:22.360
He sent me all these links
to videos he'd made,

33:22.460 --> 33:24.845
songs he'd recorded, and...

33:27.380 --> 33:29.893
I didn't open a single one.

33:30.460 --> 33:33.040
- I'm sorry. I...
- Hey, it's...

33:33.140 --> 33:35.737
It's all right. I can't even imagine.

33:42.191 --> 33:44.440
- You're James Forester, right?
- Yeah.

33:44.540 --> 33:47.490
- Will you sign my iPod?
- Sure.

33:53.600 --> 33:54.803
Here you go.

33:54.903 --> 33:57.123
- Thank you. I love your music.
- Thanks.

34:01.800 --> 34:05.140
Call me aside and I will now be

34:05.240 --> 34:09.138
And I will be fine with that

34:09.800 --> 34:15.349
You don't leave me now
You might love me back

34:17.580 --> 34:20.840
Distance is fine
I know you can't care

34:20.940 --> 34:25.120
And nothing is big like that

34:25.920 --> 34:31.270
Don't see you now, I don't see you back

34:36.739 --> 34:41.226
One day I'll be fine with that

34:41.719 --> 34:47.293
Don't leave me now
Do you love me back?

34:49.460 --> 34:53.440
I don't speak Portuguese,
and so this isn't gonna be pretty,

34:53.540 --> 34:55.869
but I am the last guy of the night,
so here you go.

36:00.820 --> 36:03.000
How long are you here for?

36:03.100 --> 36:05.400
Two more shows in New York,

36:05.500 --> 36:07.120
a wedding.

36:07.396 --> 36:09.360
Who's getting married?

36:09.660 --> 36:13.607
I don't know them.
I'm the entertainment.

36:16.020 --> 36:18.200
I never would have pegged you
for a wedding singer.

36:18.300 --> 36:21.365
10,000. Three songs.

36:21.465 --> 36:23.640
- That's not bad.
- I'm not proud of it.

36:23.740 --> 36:28.240
Last show's in Philadelphia,
and then that's it.

36:28.540 --> 36:30.766
I'm going back home.

36:33.040 --> 36:36.520
I'm actually kind of
freaked out right now.

36:37.020 --> 36:39.920
They're trying to get me to go
and record in Berlin after this,

36:40.286 --> 36:43.352
but the truth is, I'm just stuck.

36:45.760 --> 36:50.204
What happens if you don't write
any more songs?

36:52.860 --> 36:55.081
I'm not really sure.

37:03.100 --> 37:06.280
You know, the best thing
about playing...

37:06.380 --> 37:08.000
You know when you have a feeling

37:08.100 --> 37:12.600
and you don't want to fade away,
but you don't really know how to keep it?

37:13.400 --> 37:18.980
Well, that feeling comes back when I play,
like I can keep it.

37:19.080 --> 37:24.400
No... No talking,
no disappointing anyone

37:24.500 --> 37:26.284
for three to five whole minutes.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.320
You should try playing longer songs.

37:30.420 --> 37:32.218
Yeah, I should.

37:33.120 --> 37:36.360
Why don't you try to choose something

37:36.460 --> 37:39.620
and write a song about it, like a nose?

37:39.720 --> 37:41.760
- Nose?
- A nose.

37:42.460 --> 37:46.260
I don't think nose songs are my thing.

37:46.360 --> 37:50.960
You could write
the greatest song in the world

37:51.060 --> 37:54.200
about a nose...

37:54.300 --> 37:57.560
Or ears.
There's a lot of different types of ears.

37:57.660 --> 38:00.325
There are endless possibilities.

38:01.440 --> 38:05.480
I wish I could turn this

38:05.580 --> 38:10.640
Into a s... into a song

38:10.740 --> 38:15.328
Ears and noses

38:16.700 --> 38:20.340
Rhymes with roses

38:20.440 --> 38:23.060
- And...
- Neurosis

38:23.160 --> 38:27.050
Halitosis

38:28.780 --> 38:34.873
Ears and noses, halitosis
Ears and noses

39:06.700 --> 39:08.529
I can get it from here.

39:12.580 --> 39:14.808
- You all right?
- Yeah.

39:17.260 --> 39:19.400
Guess I'll see you.

39:19.500 --> 39:20.960
Yeah.

39:21.060 --> 39:23.003
Thanks again.

39:35.180 --> 39:37.205
I don't know.

39:40.300 --> 39:42.767
I'm really sorry, Henry.

39:47.660 --> 39:50.889
I didn't mean you were stupid.
I'm stupid.

39:53.780 --> 39:55.611
I'm sorry.

39:56.940 --> 40:03.949
You know I say things. Sometimes
I get too opinionated, too stubborn.

40:05.180 --> 40:07.521
You have to be okay.

41:19.520 --> 41:22.600
So I heard when you're not on the road,
you spend most of your time in the country.

41:22.700 --> 41:24.780
What are you, like, a hermit?

41:25.183 --> 41:27.600
No. Not... Not really.

41:27.700 --> 41:30.640
You once said you have no interest
in modern technology,

41:30.740 --> 41:34.320
that all you need is music
and the person you love.

41:34.420 --> 41:38.529
Yeah. Yeah. Maybe... maybe I said that.

41:39.020 --> 41:42.940
What's the strangest thing
that's happened to you on tour?

41:43.140 --> 41:44.980
I was chased by a moose.

41:46.050 --> 41:48.945
- What?
- In California.

41:58.820 --> 42:04.780
I remember her red tank top
tucked into her Vanderbilt blue jeans

42:04.880 --> 42:09.000
Her eyebrows painted on
like arches of Saint

42:09.100 --> 42:12.000
Louis in the magazines

42:12.100 --> 42:15.240
I'll wait until

42:15.340 --> 42:18.280
Iris instilled

42:18.380 --> 42:21.280
I'll wait until

42:21.380 --> 42:24.420
Iris instilled

42:24.520 --> 42:28.297
I love your apron

42:30.520 --> 42:34.158
Heaven on your head

44:26.340 --> 44:28.422
- Mom?
- Franny.

44:31.100 --> 44:34.500
- What are you doing?
- I am making piaya.

44:34.600 --> 44:36.360
Right. It's June 4th.

44:37.180 --> 44:39.220
- Damn it!
- God!

44:41.200 --> 44:43.200
Get the pillowcase out of the oven.

44:43.300 --> 44:44.820
God.

44:45.097 --> 44:46.611
So loud!

44:48.820 --> 44:51.017
God, it's so loud.

44:51.380 --> 44:52.402
Thank you.

44:54.260 --> 44:55.282
Jesus.

44:57.980 --> 45:01.310
You... You be in charge of...

45:01.860 --> 45:06.640
You be in charge of the glasses
and the decorations, okay?

45:08.540 --> 45:10.165
Thanks.

45:12.380 --> 45:16.067
You got your little hearts and

45:17.580 --> 45:20.573
Waitin' for the dawn

45:22.320 --> 45:25.920
You've been brainstormin'

45:26.020 --> 45:28.360
By my place

45:28.460 --> 45:31.080
In the sun

45:31.180 --> 45:34.680
And my bulb went black

45:35.080 --> 45:38.427
And a thousand diamondbacks

45:39.200 --> 45:41.540
Came slitherin'

45:41.990 --> 45:44.499
And hummin'

45:48.140 --> 45:52.348
We build a little bonfire

45:53.180 --> 45:56.167
By the two cent bridge

45:56.900 --> 45:58.300
There's a cat waving at you.

45:58.400 --> 46:01.840
It's one of those mechanical
good luck ones.

46:01.940 --> 46:04.360
I was staring

46:04.460 --> 46:06.320
At the edge

46:06.420 --> 46:09.100
Looks really good in here now.

46:09.700 --> 46:12.724
Actually it looks
pretty horrible, but...

46:13.647 --> 46:16.197
it's better than it was.

46:18.220 --> 46:23.368
It's your half-birthday,
and we're celebrating it.

46:28.660 --> 46:32.480
Do you remember when we were
in Zurich for your half-birthday?

46:32.580 --> 46:34.200
You were, like, five.

46:34.300 --> 46:38.380
All you wanted were M&M's and lemonade,

46:38.980 --> 46:43.200
and we couldn't find any. It was just
expensive Swiss chocolate everywhere,

46:43.300 --> 46:48.420
and then finally, we found some M&M's
after hours of searching,

46:48.520 --> 46:53.277
and mom bought you, like, 50 packs,

46:53.620 --> 46:55.643
bought out the store.

47:23.080 --> 47:25.787
Happy half-birthday, Henry.

47:26.437 --> 47:28.560
Sorry about all this.

47:28.660 --> 47:31.001
Happy half, Henry.

47:37.392 --> 47:38.922
Hey.

47:40.527 --> 47:43.300
- Sorry if I'm interrupting.
- You... You are not.

47:43.400 --> 47:45.680
Come on in. Join the party.

47:45.780 --> 47:48.400
I think we even have an extra hat.

47:48.865 --> 47:50.440
Here you go.

47:50.906 --> 47:52.479
Looks nice.

47:53.420 --> 47:55.188
It's Henry's half-birthday.

47:57.740 --> 47:59.369
Keyboard looks good too.

48:01.040 --> 48:03.320
Hey, have some persecco.

48:03.520 --> 48:05.600
Don't tell the nurses.

48:05.924 --> 48:08.218
- Thanks.
- Sure.

48:09.580 --> 48:11.164
Cheers.

48:13.140 --> 48:14.605
Thank you.

48:18.280 --> 48:20.325
Turn left.

48:24.426 --> 48:26.311
Please.

48:26.411 --> 48:29.695
You didn't even speak Russian.
Why did you want Henry to learn it?

48:29.995 --> 48:33.403
I wanted us to learn it together.
Secret language.

48:34.660 --> 48:38.466
Yours and 150 million
other people's secret language.

48:40.176 --> 48:42.644
I don't speak Russian.

48:44.260 --> 48:47.040
Why do they always make you learn that?

48:47.140 --> 48:50.780
It is obvious you don't speak Russian.
Why do you have to go around stating that?

48:51.280 --> 48:55.220
Mom, I just... I wish you
could listen for two minutes.

48:59.340 --> 49:03.088
I'm so sorry.
That is good coming from...

49:04.753 --> 49:06.800
Never mind.
No, no, no, no. Come on, mom.

49:06.900 --> 49:09.026
Tell me. What were you going to say?

49:10.660 --> 49:15.000
I was going to say that that is good
coming from a girl who didn't even call

49:15.100 --> 49:17.907
her own brother back
to say she was sorry.

49:21.300 --> 49:26.600
You can't tell me that you thought that
dropping out of college was a good idea.

49:26.700 --> 49:30.040
Franny, he did not want to go back.

49:30.140 --> 49:33.760
- What was I supposed to do?
- You never would have let me do that.

49:33.860 --> 49:37.400
You never would have wanted
to have done that ever.

49:37.500 --> 49:42.080
And speaking of you, you basically
dropped off the grid for six months.

49:42.180 --> 49:45.600
For six months, we didn't hear
anything from you and...

49:45.700 --> 49:49.380
- Oh, is that okay?
- No, I called you. I did text.

49:49.480 --> 49:51.640
Oh, yeah. The famous text, yeah.

49:51.740 --> 49:54.340
Well, if you would empty your voicemail
every once in a while.

49:54.440 --> 49:57.900
That's it. Yup, that's it.
You're right. You have all the answers.

49:58.000 --> 50:00.700
You came out of my womb
havin' all the answers, man.

50:00.800 --> 50:03.885
- God!
- Oh, my God.

50:15.700 --> 50:17.498
James.

50:18.100 --> 50:21.200
Would you like to come over for dinner?

50:21.600 --> 50:23.560
I have a show tonight.

50:23.660 --> 50:26.520
- Okay. Tomorrow night then.
- Mom.

50:26.820 --> 50:29.460
You... You don't have to, really.

50:29.560 --> 50:31.847
I would love to.

50:33.780 --> 50:36.240
Temperature

50:36.340 --> 50:39.420
Keeps rising like

50:39.520 --> 50:42.440
A helium balloon

50:42.540 --> 50:45.800
Sound of the helicopters

50:45.900 --> 50:49.363
Echo in the bedroom

51:04.480 --> 51:06.487
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

51:07.860 --> 51:10.720
- I'm... I'm glad you came.
- Yeah?

51:10.820 --> 51:12.559
I just...

51:13.380 --> 51:16.415
Decided to last minute, yeah.

51:18.380 --> 51:20.700
Do you want...

51:22.020 --> 51:24.575
Do you want a star fruit?

51:27.620 --> 51:31.520
- No, thank you.
- Yeah, I'm not big on star fruit either.

51:32.002 --> 51:34.064
Let me see that.

51:34.760 --> 51:37.203
James, you're up.

51:40.980 --> 51:43.929
Good luck out there.
They're wild tonight.

51:59.520 --> 52:05.751
We slipped out under cover of champagne

52:06.660 --> 52:12.180
You tried to kiss me by the dollar save

52:13.180 --> 52:15.740
Instead I took your hand

52:15.840 --> 52:19.978
As we rode around the aisle

52:20.680 --> 52:25.980
Fillin' up our pockets with aspartame

52:26.580 --> 52:30.800
And your little yellow dress

52:30.900 --> 52:34.360
Made me go ballistic

52:34.460 --> 52:37.880
Begged you not to change it

52:37.980 --> 52:40.440
And you never did

52:40.540 --> 52:44.299
I'm so glad

52:44.420 --> 52:51.126
That you disappear when things got bad

52:51.460 --> 52:55.462
And I cut off all my hair

52:57.540 --> 53:00.700
You swore I would stay forever

53:00.800 --> 53:04.736
Piston boots and jeans

53:05.100 --> 53:10.600
Pegged at the ankle by the seams

53:11.800 --> 53:14.680
You checked out

53:14.780 --> 53:18.460
Before I started riding

53:19.260 --> 53:24.920
Could you hear the sirens
from the backseat?

53:25.420 --> 53:29.327
And your little yellow dress

53:29.540 --> 53:33.060
God, you're so sadistic

53:33.160 --> 53:36.560
Let me underneath it

53:36.660 --> 53:39.000
Now you keep it hid

53:39.100 --> 53:43.134
Oh, I'm so glad

53:43.234 --> 53:50.040
That you disappeared when things got bad

53:50.140 --> 53:54.206
And I cut off all my hair

53:56.140 --> 53:58.920
I still keep my money

53:59.020 --> 54:03.440
In the pillow on my bed

54:03.540 --> 54:07.218
Yes, the black dog still following

54:10.700 --> 54:13.856
You would find it funny

54:14.152 --> 54:17.584
Maybe hysterical

54:18.260 --> 54:22.814
But I still believe in miracles

54:24.500 --> 54:28.360
And your little yellow dress

54:28.660 --> 54:32.240
Thought you were a mystic

54:32.340 --> 54:34.680
Thought you could predict it

54:35.980 --> 54:39.320
But you never could

54:39.420 --> 54:42.260
Your little yellow dress

54:43.060 --> 54:46.660
Made me go ballistic

54:46.760 --> 54:50.120
Never will forget it

54:50.220 --> 54:52.421
And I never should

56:05.015 --> 56:08.000
- Discman.
- Yeah, I'm a bit old-fashioned.

56:08.300 --> 56:12.150
This is my favorite song in the world.

56:14.100 --> 56:15.823
I'm ready.

56:16.520 --> 56:18.940
I like it when you do it like that

56:19.040 --> 56:21.691
Yeah, like that

56:25.360 --> 56:26.777
This is your favorite song?

56:26.877 --> 56:27.980
I like it when you do it like that

56:28.080 --> 56:30.840
Okay, oh. Not that one.
That's a guilty pleasure.

56:30.940 --> 56:33.060
It's an old mix. Hold on. Wait.

56:34.140 --> 56:36.744
Okay, I think you're gonna love it.

56:45.260 --> 56:49.280
My baby don't care for shows

56:49.380 --> 56:53.420
My baby don't care for clothes

56:54.620 --> 56:56.320
My baby just cares...

56:56.420 --> 57:00.016
This is for you from Katie Johnstone.

57:00.540 --> 57:03.640
"Hey, James. Give 'er a listen."
I think he's trying to speak to you as you.

57:03.840 --> 57:06.643
- Give 'er. Give us a listen.
- Yeah, yeah.

57:07.110 --> 57:10.019
"Dear James, I have been"...

57:10.780 --> 57:13.020
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, it's an epic.

57:13.620 --> 57:17.109
"I would be extremely stoke...

57:17.340 --> 57:21.857
"Ed to get a coffee, or in my case,

57:21.957 --> 57:25.560
"a hot chocolate because
I don't like coffee very much."

57:26.526 --> 57:28.396
You're kidding me.

57:28.860 --> 57:30.880
"You would like it."

57:30.980 --> 57:33.804
She sounds like she just drank
a hell of a lot of coffee.

57:35.380 --> 57:36.535
Wow.

57:38.600 --> 57:41.072
She sort of got the eyes right.

57:41.980 --> 57:44.120
- What?
- Yeah, this is hilarious.

57:44.220 --> 57:48.835
Oh, my good...
"Die, James, die... James."

57:51.120 --> 57:53.160
And check out this side.

57:53.260 --> 57:55.920
"I'm coming, James.

57:56.120 --> 57:59.640
James, James, James, James."

57:59.740 --> 58:01.920
That's my favorite one.
Look at the eyes.

58:02.020 --> 58:05.080
- I just got kind of worried about you.
- Look at the eyes.

58:05.180 --> 58:07.339
They're gonna hypnotize me.

58:10.260 --> 58:12.952
Beautiful. You have to try it on.

58:13.052 --> 58:15.840
- It's gonna be way too small.
- It's a medium.

58:15.940 --> 58:19.380
- It's a children's medium.
- I don't... It's cotton. It'll stretch.

58:19.480 --> 58:21.164
- Really?
- Yeah.

58:24.860 --> 58:25.847
For you.

58:29.148 --> 58:30.720
Sorry.

58:31.400 --> 58:32.986
There.

58:38.180 --> 58:40.845
I'm ready to go out now.

58:42.380 --> 58:47.500
Well, I ask myself, what have you done
my sisters and brother?

58:47.600 --> 58:52.030
I don't know
I don't know

58:52.140 --> 58:57.205
Say you told your lie without no shame

58:59.792 --> 59:01.460
Listen, y'all

59:01.560 --> 59:03.813
It ain't easy

59:04.480 --> 59:07.087
There'll be nowhere to run

59:08.940 --> 59:12.080
Well, you shoulda gone and paid

59:12.180 --> 59:13.840
Yeah

59:13.940 --> 59:15.326
For what you done

59:37.400 --> 59:41.401
- You know, this is really good.
- It's not mine, the zombies.

59:49.580 --> 59:52.480
How does the melody line go?

59:52.580 --> 59:57.160
Something like... Can't nobody

59:57.260 --> 01:00:00.502
Love me

01:00:08.865 --> 01:00:13.760
Do you want to see the view from the top
of the empire state building?

01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:18.847
Definitely not, I'm afraid of heights

01:00:22.180 --> 01:00:25.360
You don't want to go up high?

01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:28.500
Don't want to touch the sky?

01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:32.402
- 'Cause you're afraid...
- Afraid of heights

01:01:01.780 --> 01:01:04.391
"Ulysses now left the haven

01:01:04.491 --> 01:01:08.220
"and took the rough track up
though the wooded country

01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:11.100
"and over the crest of the Mountain

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:14.740
till he reached the place
where Minerva had said."

01:01:14.940 --> 01:01:18.100
I actually don't mind
the smell of smoke in my house

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:23.180
because it reminds me
of presanitized times, you know,

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:26.180
like Paris in the '70s.

01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:29.464
- Were you there in the '70s?
- Who wasn't?

01:01:31.940 --> 01:01:35.400
Well, I... Okay, a lot of people weren't,
you two for example,

01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:38.880
but my God, I'm sorry you weren't.

01:01:38.980 --> 01:01:41.274
It was so great.

01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:44.546
I got...

01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:46.640
So much there.

01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:50.018
I got my master's,

01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:56.020
lovers... I won't say how many.
Don't worry.

01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:59.860
A husband.
I was an Arkansas girl in Paris.

01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:01.701
How great is that?

01:02:01.801 --> 01:02:05.486
And then of course,
I did date a famous rock star.

01:02:05.586 --> 01:02:06.780
Who?

01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:09.980
She hasn't even told me.
I'm not even sure it's true.

01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:12.980
Of course it's true.
Why would I make that up?

01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:14.200
This guy was amazing.

01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:17.660
He taught me one of the hardest songs
even to learn on the guitar.

01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:19.180
Blackbird by the Beatles.

01:02:19.725 --> 01:02:21.980
Great song. Never learned it.

01:02:23.137 --> 01:02:25.580
It is a great one, James.

01:02:26.313 --> 01:02:27.340
Oh, my God.

01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:31.960
I gave Henry one time for Christmas,

01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:36.700
and he loved it so much,
this unbelievable green accordion,

01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:38.820
and he slept with it.

01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:41.660
It was a Teddy bear.
It was like his Teddy bear, you know?

01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:44.979
My mom gave me my first guitar
when I was 13.

01:02:45.079 --> 01:02:48.320
Yeah, did it have a picture
of a hulu dancer on it?

01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:51.180
Nope, unfortunately...

01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:56.800
- Here it is.
- Oh, hey, come on.

01:02:58.780 --> 01:03:00.379
Thank you.

01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:04.460
You are a very good girl.
I don't know how you are my daughter.

01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:07.301
- Well, you raised me well.
- Yeah, so well.

01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:29.045
Oh, my God. That was so bad.

01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:33.262
Why, thank you.

01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:38.960
Franny, what was the song
that you were so obsessed with.

01:03:41.529 --> 01:03:45.420
Come on. By America? By America.

01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:49.260
- Oh, I don't remember.
- Oh, you remember.

01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:52.620
Oh, my God. Yes, you do. She remembers.

01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:56.080
She sang it nonstop, all the time,

01:03:56.180 --> 01:03:57.800
over and over and over and over.

01:03:57.900 --> 01:04:02.700
She sang it in the school talent show
because it was the '92 election,

01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:07.020
and she believed
that it had political subtext

01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:11.486
about how much the country needed
to have Bill Clinton elected as president.

01:04:11.586 --> 01:04:15.100
- I was eight.
- And here it is.

01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:17.540
- Oh, no. No!
- No, come on.

01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:18.740
- You did so good.
- No.

01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:21.380
Come on. You were so good.

01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:23.220
- No, I wasn't.
- So good.

01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:24.960
Mom, come on.
This... this is embarrassing.

01:04:25.060 --> 01:04:28.360
- I don't believe in embarrassment.
- I am kind of curious now.

01:04:28.460 --> 01:04:32.320
Come on, Franny.
It'll just make me so happy.

01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:36.052
We used to laugh

01:04:37.220 --> 01:04:39.060
We used to cry

01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:44.020
We used to bow our heads

01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:47.851
Then wonder why

01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:50.580
And now you're gone

01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:54.225
I guess I'll carry on

01:04:55.800 --> 01:05:00.611
And make the best
of what you've left to me

01:05:02.180 --> 01:05:05.635
Left to me

01:05:05.735 --> 01:05:08.756
Left to me

01:05:08.856 --> 01:05:11.274
I need you

01:05:11.780 --> 01:05:15.080
Like the flowers need the rain

01:05:15.180 --> 01:05:18.174
You know I need you

01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:22.060
Guess I'll start it all again

01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:25.650
You know I need you

01:05:25.900 --> 01:05:29.100
Like the winter needs the spring

01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:32.080
You know I need you

01:05:32.180 --> 01:05:35.795
I need you

01:05:40.740 --> 01:05:43.158
And every day

01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:44.929
I'd laugh

01:05:45.058 --> 01:05:46.930
Beautiful.

01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:48.630
Mom.

01:05:48.730 --> 01:05:53.380
Just knowing you were thinkin' of me

01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:57.126
- Mom.
- No. I have to go to bed.

01:05:58.780 --> 01:06:00.020
Beautiful.

01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:07.543
For every story told about me

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.340
About me

01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:12.060
She'll be okay.

01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:13.456
About me

01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:18.194
I need you

01:07:56.520 --> 01:07:58.608
Is that something new?

01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:04.160
Nah, just...
No, something been thinkin' of.

01:08:04.260 --> 01:08:05.307
Might be nothing.

01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:25.160
When are you heading back home?

01:08:25.260 --> 01:08:29.435
Day after tomorrow,
right after the show in Philly.

01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:35.774
Come on.

01:09:51.439 --> 01:09:53.175
Hey, James.

01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:54.620
- Hey.
- Hey, thanks, man.

01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:56.700
You were great,
really made Lisa's night.

01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:58.540
- Thanks. Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:01.400
James. Thank you.

01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:04.620
- I just want to get one picture.
- Sure.

01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:05.860
Oh, yeah.

01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:11.794
Good. Great.

01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:17.406
All right, that's enough.
Probably get back in, you know?

01:10:17.506 --> 01:10:20.222
- Thank you.
- I know. He's amazing. You're welcome.

01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:47.950
I know. This is kind of short.

01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:02.449
This... This is something
I've been working on...

01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:06.905
Something new,

01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:12.430
still in progress,
but I hope you like it.

01:11:18.500 --> 01:11:21.679
All right. That wasn't it.

01:11:52.900 --> 01:11:55.580
Henry! Henry.

01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:57.140
Hey.

01:11:57.240 --> 01:11:58.980
Hey.

01:11:59.180 --> 01:12:02.460
Henry. Henry?

01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:04.417
Henry, can you hear me?

01:12:04.517 --> 01:12:06.796
No. No, no, no, no. No, no, no.

01:12:06.896 --> 01:12:08.939
Come back. Come back.
Henry, come on. Come on, wake up.

01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:12.425
I need somebody. My brother...
I need a nurse. I need...

01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:31.380
He... He opened his eyes.
I saw it. He...

01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:33.740
I'm going to go talk to the doctor,

01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:35.824
and he'll talk to you.

01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:41.706
Come on, Henry.
Henry, wake up. Wake up, please.

01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:49.100
Henry.

01:12:49.300 --> 01:12:51.614
It's me and Franny.

01:12:53.380 --> 01:12:56.639
We know you can hear us, and we're here.

01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:15.300
I broke up

01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:19.491
With the man in the moon last night

01:13:24.660 --> 01:13:26.270
Sorry.

01:13:47.140 --> 01:13:49.120
Henry?

01:13:49.220 --> 01:13:51.882
Hey. Hey.

01:13:52.780 --> 01:13:54.564
Hey.

01:13:56.920 --> 01:13:58.870
Henry.

01:14:09.580 --> 01:14:11.266
Henry.

01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:22.986
- Franny?
- Yes. Yeah.

01:14:29.820 --> 01:14:31.460
Yeah.

01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:41.939
I'm so sorry.

01:14:49.420 --> 01:14:52.199
You need to keep your eyes open.

01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:57.380
- Oh, excuse me.
- Yes, dear?

01:14:57.480 --> 01:15:00.988
- Have you seen a guy with a guitar case?
- Sorry, I haven't.

01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:36.825
I finally realized how hungry I am.

01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:39.499
You want some?

01:15:49.340 --> 01:15:51.420
Franny, no. No.

01:15:52.980 --> 01:15:55.464
That is so, so bad for you.

01:15:55.864 --> 01:16:00.246
I know. I am a hypocrite,
the worst kind.

01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:09.846
Franny. He's gonna be fine.

01:16:11.060 --> 01:16:12.798
Hey.

01:16:18.660 --> 01:16:20.250
Hey.

01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:52.813
Floatin' in the motel pool until

01:16:53.413 --> 01:16:55.320
All the rooms were clean

01:16:55.420 --> 01:16:58.400
Imagine angels in the sky

01:16:58.500 --> 01:17:02.280
Were prettiest I'd ever seen

01:17:02.380 --> 01:17:05.220
I'll wait until

01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:08.220
Iris instilled

01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:11.140
I'll wait until

01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:12.790
Iris instilled

01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:39.060
- Can I buy a ticket inside?
- Right inside there.

01:17:39.834 --> 01:17:41.880
- I wrote something...
- Hi, one, please.

01:17:42.180 --> 01:17:43.920
Show's sold out.

01:17:44.803 --> 01:17:48.040
In fact, I've only played it
for two people.

01:17:48.340 --> 01:17:52.340
I started it in New York
for someone I met there.

01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:54.980
This one was a new experience for me.

01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:57.220
It's not finished, and I...

01:17:57.320 --> 01:18:01.260
I wasn't gonna play it tonight,
but for some reason...

01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:02.700
Last show.

01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:06.660
And... okay, I'll just...

01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:09.142
I'm gonna get it over with now.

01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:14.100
I remember that day

01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:17.460
And the arms said noon

01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:20.620
And my bed was in the dark

01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:24.180
Underneath the blue balloon

01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:26.580
Then a swarm of love

01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:30.340
Surrounded me

01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:33.540
And my head was standing on its end

01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:36.460
With electricity

01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:39.220
And as I looked out

01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:42.780
On my old life

01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:46.220
I was speeding through the forest

01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:48.540
On a motorbike

01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:51.740
I waved to you

01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:55.140
But you couldn't see

01:18:55.240 --> 01:18:59.848
I could hear a crowd of people
Calling after me

01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:04.180
Wake up, little dreamer

01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:08.660
It's time to rise

01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:13.215
Open up your eyes

01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:18.140
I've been holding out

01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:21.480
For a lifeline

01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:24.100
And I followed you

01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:26.800
To the depths of my own mind

01:19:26.900 --> 01:19:29.740
I've been wandering

01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:32.980
Kind of scattershot

01:19:33.080 --> 01:19:35.980
Bumpin' into other people's lives

01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:38.700
Without a second thought

01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:41.220
Now I do believe

01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:44.180
In the mystical

01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:47.260
That we have some vague connection

01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:49.960
To the other world

01:19:50.060 --> 01:19:52.620
And now all I've said

01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:56.000
May not all be true

01:19:56.100 --> 01:19:59.960
But this silver song I sing tonight

01:20:00.060 --> 01:20:03.303
I swear it's just for you

01:21:15.220 --> 01:21:19.980
Do you want to see the view
from the top of the empire state building?

01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:25.466
Definitely not, I'm afraid of heights

01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:31.500
You don't want to go up high?

01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:35.140
Don't want to touch the sky?

01:21:35.240 --> 01:21:39.744
- 'Cause you're afraid
- Afraid of heights

01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:57.420
No, I don't wanna go

01:21:57.520 --> 01:22:01.380
To the top of the empire state building

01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:05.640
'Cause I'm afraid of heights

01:22:05.940 --> 01:22:09.023
Oh, that's too bad.
It's real nice up there.

01:22:42.020 --> 01:22:46.947
No, 'cause I'm afraid of heights

01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:10.180
I remember her red tank top
tucked into her Vanderbilt blue jeans

01:23:10.280 --> 01:23:14.420
Her eyebrows painted on
like arches of Saint

01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:17.380
Louis in the magazines

01:23:17.480 --> 01:23:20.280
I'll wait until

01:23:20.380 --> 01:23:23.140
Iris instilled

01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:26.340
I'll wait until

01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:29.200
Iris instilled

01:23:29.400 --> 01:23:34.029
Heaven on your heaven

01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:37.700
Oh, heaven on your head

01:23:37.800 --> 01:23:40.193
Sun

01:23:51.820 --> 01:23:54.620
Floatin' in the motel pool

01:23:54.720 --> 01:23:57.360
Till all the rooms were clean

01:23:57.460 --> 01:24:00.540
Imagine angels in the sky

01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:04.540
Were prettiest I'd ever seen

01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:07.420
I'll wait until

01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:10.420
Iris instilled

01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:13.320
I'll wait until

01:24:13.420 --> 01:24:16.260
Iris instilled

01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:21.061
Heaven on your heaven

01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:24.940
Oh, heaven on your head

01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:27.381
Sun

01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:30.840
I'll wait until

01:24:30.940 --> 01:24:33.860
Iris instilled

01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:36.720
I'll wait until

01:24:36.820 --> 01:24:39.580
Iris instilled

01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:42.620
- I'll wait until
- I'll wait until

01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:45.380
Iris instilled

01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:48.500
- I'll wait until
- I'll wait until

01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:51.420
Iris instilled

01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:56.100
Heaven on your heaven

01:24:56.800 --> 01:25:00.540
Oh, heaven on your head

01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:02.794
Sun

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.860
The day we met my life was changed

01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:36.820
I always heard that love was strange
and painful

01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:40.033
Painful

01:25:40.920 --> 01:25:43.860
One night you slept upon your side

01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:48.822
Tangled in white you looked just like
an angel

01:25:49.880 --> 01:25:52.022
An angel

01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:55.260
So why

01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:58.060
Did you fly away?

01:25:58.160 --> 01:26:01.240
I've been dying a little death

01:26:01.340 --> 01:26:03.980
Since that very day

01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:07.320
I used to laugh

01:26:07.420 --> 01:26:09.860
When you told me

01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:15.898
You must forget and forgive to be free

01:26:20.060 --> 01:26:22.860
Down by water dressed in black

01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:27.859
I swore revenge to get you back, hateful

01:26:28.939 --> 01:26:31.060
Hateful

01:26:31.960 --> 01:26:34.780
I made my camp upon the hill

01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:39.810
Drank whiskey from the secret still
Blameful

01:26:40.982 --> 01:26:42.993
Blameful

01:26:43.620 --> 01:26:46.260
So why

01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:49.160
Did you fly away?

01:26:49.260 --> 01:26:52.180
I've been dying a little death

01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:54.820
Since that very day

01:26:54.920 --> 01:26:58.280
I used to laugh

01:26:58.380 --> 01:27:00.780
When you told me

01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:06.888
You must forget and forgive to be free

01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:14.510
And I never could admit

01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:19.179
The part I had in this

01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:22.660
So this is what I get

01:27:22.760 --> 01:27:24.820
My friend

01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:28.660
Now I know why

01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:31.060
You ran away

01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:34.080
And I've been dying a little death

01:27:34.180 --> 01:27:36.880
Since that very day

01:27:36.980 --> 01:27:40.220
I used to laugh

01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:42.820
When you told me

01:27:42.920 --> 01:27:45.820
You must forget and forgive

01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:48.820
You must forgive just to live

01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:52.381
You must forget and forgive

01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:54.949
To be free
