Have you ever seen people laugh less

than comedians at a comedy party?

00:11.344 --> 00:12.711
Oh, I know, right? All the laughs

00:12.712 --> 00:14.513
of a free AIDS test without the glamour.

00:14.514 --> 00:16.683
Carl retweeted my joke
about how Miles Teller

00:16.684 --> 00:18.351
looks exactly k.d. lang.

00:18.352 --> 00:19.252
How is Carl?

00:19.253 --> 00:20.387
He's super sweet,

00:20.388 --> 00:22.188
but he's almost too sweet.

00:22.189 --> 00:23.355
- Mm-hm.
- Sometimes I just think

00:23.356 --> 00:24.291
I want a guy to come up to me

00:24.292 --> 00:25.591
and be like, "Hey."

00:25.592 --> 00:27.392
And then within five minutes we're

00:27.393 --> 00:29.327
just videotaping ourselves having sex

00:29.328 --> 00:30.795
for some James Franco art project.

00:30.796 --> 00:32.162
Maybe you just don't want a boyfriend?

00:32.164 --> 00:33.632
Well, at least not one so kind.

00:33.633 --> 00:35.469
The only kind of kind I
like is Richard Kind.

00:35.470 --> 00:38.437
Oh, God, I would love
to fuck Richard Kind.

00:38.438 --> 00:40.338
I just want Carl to be a little meaner.

00:40.339 --> 00:41.640
Mean people are the ones you remember.

00:41.641 --> 00:43.644
Like, on my recaps, the only commenter

00:43.645 --> 00:46.612
I ever remembered is this happyhour37.

00:46.613 --> 00:49.080
She posts the nastiest
stuff about me every day.

00:49.081 --> 00:50.682
Like, what does she do,
just attack your writing?

00:50.683 --> 00:53.184
She used to. But now it's gotten personal.

00:53.185 --> 00:54.688
She found what I look like
and she started calling me

00:54.689 --> 00:55.988
Fat Reba.

Okay, well, guys,

01:20.279 --> 01:21.346
the podcast is for

01:21.347 --> 01:23.381
comedians who are atheists, so.

01:23.382 --> 01:25.083
I don't even know if you
guys are comedians.

01:25.084 --> 01:26.751
Yes, we are very much comedians.

01:26.752 --> 01:28.320
And we're very much atheists.

01:28.321 --> 01:29.688
I mean, we think people that do believe

01:29.689 --> 01:31.356
in God are huge dumb-dumbs.

01:31.357 --> 01:33.158
Yeah, if God exists,
then why isn't Monique

01:33.159 --> 01:34.428
one of the new Ghostbusters?

01:34.429 --> 01:37.163
And what kind of God

01:37.164 --> 01:40.499
would've taken away my mother's legs?

01:40.500 --> 01:41.534
Seriously?

Your mom lost her legs?

01:43.136 --> 01:45.303
One of them is cut off right at the hip,

if you get on a podcast network,

02:55.007 --> 02:56.875
podcasts can lead to a book deal,

which can lead to a basic
cable holding deal,

02:58.845 --> 03:00.946

07:29.317 --> 07:30.983
No, of course not.

07:30.984 --> 07:33.351
Anything used is crawling with bedbugs.

07:33.352 --> 07:35.019
You know, they found them on the 7 train?

07:35.020 --> 07:37.322
And the South Street Seaport Abercrombie.

07:37.323 --> 07:39.092

Carl.

What's happening?

15:54.954 --> 15:56.387
Doing some shopping, I see.

15:56.388 --> 15:58.189
Guilty. How's your stomach?

15:58.190 --> 16:00.360
Is it feeling better than the other night?

16:00.361 --> 16:02.361
Oh, yeah, yes, it is.

16:02.362 --> 16:04.328
Oh my God. Food poisoning is the worst.

16:04.329 --> 16:06.063
You've got to stop eating takeout.

16:12.070 --> 16:13.273
Oh, don't be sorry.

What's going on?

16:25.451 --> 16:26.818
Is this your dog?

16:26.819 --> 16:28.352
- He bit me.
- Me too!

16:28.353 --> 16:30.288
You can't just leave an
aggressive dog unattended.

16:30.289 --> 16:31.355
Where were you, dummy?

16:31.356 --> 16:32.959
Who's gonna pay for this, huh?

16:32.960 --> 16:34.226
Is this a scam?

16:34.227 --> 16:35.193
A scam?

16:35.194 --> 16:36.395
Oh man.

16:36.396 --> 16:38.429
I mean, if coming to a dog park

16:38.430 --> 16:40.965
to take advantage of sad, lonely gay guys

16:40.966 --> 16:42.433
with the offer of mutual jerking off...

16:42.434 --> 16:44.101
- Excuse me?
- ...and then

16:44.102 --> 16:46.003
having your a cappella
group extort as much money

16:46.004 --> 16:48.839
as possible from them
is a scam, then maybe.

16:48.840 --> 16:50.808
But I wouldn't use that word.

16:50.809 --> 16:52.243
You're telling me I blew off a nice guy

16:52.244 --> 16:53.778
for, what, a prostitute?

16:53.779 --> 16:54.445
- Hey...
- That's what you are,

16:54.446 --> 16:55.313
you're a prostitute,

16:55.314 --> 16:56.781
except with more steps.

16:56.782 --> 16:58.318
Hey, hey! Don't give them your money!

16:58.319 --> 16:59.451

Matthew?

17:02.088 --> 17:03.587
Oh, please, please,
please don't tell Barry.

17:03.588 --> 17:05.589
He can't take this stress,
he's so close to death.

17:05.589 --> 17:06.459
Are you kidding me?

17:06.460 --> 17:08.060
You jerked off Matthew?

17:08.060 --> 17:09.028
You two know each other?

17:09.029 --> 17:09.928
This city!

17:09.929 --> 17:11.230
It takes a real creep

17:11.231 --> 17:14.266
to spoil some innocent public jerk-off.

17:14.267 --> 17:17.367
Everyone who does a capella

17:17.368 --> 17:20.104
I knew my dogs wouldn't have
bitten three strangers.

17:20.105 --> 17:22.306
They're assholes, they're not monsters.

17:22.307 --> 17:23.507
I don't think you're paying attention

17:23.508 --> 17:25.175
