WEBVTT

00:05.660 --> 00:07.896
Ah... Three more,
Cocktail Johnny.

00:07.964 --> 00:10.364
Schmidt,
that is melon-flavored liquor.

00:10.932 --> 00:13.534
It's 4 proof, okay? That is safe
to drink while you're pregnant.

00:13.603 --> 00:15.369
- Melon balls.
WINSTON: Schmidt, no matter

00:15.370 --> 00:16.604
how much you get drunk,

00:16.671 --> 00:18.539
- Cece's still gonna be engaged.
SCHMIDT: Cece?

00:18.607 --> 00:21.175
- Now, I know you're down about it.
- I'm not down about Cece.

00:21.243 --> 00:25.012
- This is, this is a mess. -  Listen, there
are plenty of things to be down about:

00:25.080 --> 00:26.880
The air pollution
in China, the deficit,

00:26.948 --> 00:28.983
<i>The Hobbit</i> wasn't very good.
If I want to see

00:28.984 --> 00:31.351
dwarves in a real-time
dinner scene, I would've gone

00:31.352 --> 00:33.087
to Koreatown.
Booyah! Ball me.

00:33.654 --> 00:35.222
- Ball you?
- Ball me!

00:35.289 --> 00:36.923
What are you...
(Groans)

00:36.991 --> 00:38.625
How do you get these
toppy things off, Nick?

00:38.692 --> 00:40.212
Oh, Schmidt...
You look like a lab rat.

00:40.228 --> 00:41.361
NICK:
Okay, you know what?

00:41.429 --> 00:42.729
I'm adding that to your bill.

00:42.796 --> 00:43.997
(Chuckles)

00:44.064 --> 00:46.032
What the hell is this?

00:46.100 --> 00:48.300
What?!
You're giving us a check?

00:48.368 --> 00:50.569
- No more free drinks.
- I didn't even know you had these here.

00:50.637 --> 00:53.005
- Take all of my money and then get out of my room.
NICK: You guys, come on.

00:53.072 --> 00:54.740
Show a little respect.
This is my job.

00:54.807 --> 00:56.275
- Nick, I saw you pee in the register.
- Yeah, once.

00:56.343 --> 00:58.110
- You think I was sober for that?
- You once put

00:58.178 --> 01:00.379
a sign out that said
"Take a Drink, Leave a Drink."

01:00.447 --> 01:04.081
Okay, it's the only job I have,
and I'm trying to be... good.

01:04.150 --> 01:07.252
Okay? It's about time I got
a little responsibility.

01:07.319 --> 01:08.018
(Grunts)

01:08.019 --> 01:09.387
- Responsibility?
- I thought of

01:09.455 --> 01:11.523
a new promotion--
it's like Ladies' Night

01:11.590 --> 01:13.625
but it's the opposite:
It's Guys' Night.

01:13.693 --> 01:15.994
The new manager loved the idea,
and if it goes well--

01:16.062 --> 01:17.495
(Fading):
Maybe there's a promotion;

01:17.563 --> 01:19.131
I can start
moving up in the world.

01:19.198 --> 01:22.667

01:38.783 --> 01:40.583
I think Nick being ambitious

01:40.651 --> 01:42.518
about the bar is making me...

01:43.086 --> 01:45.421
want him more.
Is that, like, a thing?

01:45.489 --> 01:49.059
No. No woman's ever been
attracted to power and success.

01:49.126 --> 01:50.359
It's just like...

01:50.427 --> 01:52.795
I thought it was one kiss
and then it was over.

01:52.862 --> 01:54.830
(Groans) Hey, sorry,
I'm just putting a load on.

01:54.898 --> 01:56.231
Got a shift at the bar.

01:56.299 --> 01:57.800
You know that there's
a separate compartment

01:57.867 --> 01:58.801
to put the soap in?

01:58.868 --> 02:00.002
(Chuckles)

02:00.070 --> 02:01.704
(Chuckles)

02:04.007 --> 02:05.007
I didn't know that.

02:05.075 --> 02:06.341
Little soap house.

02:06.409 --> 02:08.743
Anyway, I'm getting
this mess cleaned up.

02:08.811 --> 02:11.012
I gotta say,
it feels really good.

02:11.080 --> 02:13.380
Do any of you guys know
where the iron is?

02:13.948 --> 02:16.117
- Get out!
- What? I want to iron my button-down.

02:16.185 --> 02:18.205
- Get out, Nick!
 - What is happening right now?

02:18.206 --> 02:19.505
- Get out!
- Why are you being so mean to me?

02:19.521 --> 02:20.454
Get out!

02:20.522 --> 02:22.790
What is going on with you?

02:26.560 --> 02:28.862
There's a new manager; That's
why I'm making you guys pay.

02:28.930 --> 02:31.264
And you actually care
about what he thinks?

02:31.332 --> 02:32.766
- Hey, Shane.
- Hey.

02:32.834 --> 02:34.567
Hey, guys. This is Shane.
This is my new manager.

02:34.635 --> 02:36.636
- Oh, got it.
- I'm really excited to have her here.

02:36.704 --> 02:39.039
We're really getting this
place in order. We're, uh...

02:39.107 --> 02:40.640
(Chuckles)

02:40.708 --> 02:42.174
Makes a lot more sense now.

02:43.542 --> 02:45.444
God, I can't stop thinking
about the other night.

02:45.761 --> 02:48.064
Hope you gave that bar
an extra wipe-down.

02:48.065 --> 02:49.831
NICK: Yeah.
SHANE: You're just like the opposite

02:49.899 --> 02:52.101
of everyone I went
to business school with.

02:52.168 --> 02:54.803
- I mean, look at you. You're just...
You're so real.     - Yeah.

02:54.871 --> 02:56.071
- Oh, yeah.
- He's incredibly real.

02:56.139 --> 02:57.571
- As real as they get.
- Yeah, the realest.

02:57.639 --> 02:59.573
- Shut up, both of you.
- You're a mess.

02:59.641 --> 03:02.043
- Yeah.   -  I got dirt on my
face after we made out.

03:02.111 --> 03:04.178
God, I loved it.
Get back to work.

03:04.246 --> 03:06.747
- You got it.
- Get back to work!

03:06.815 --> 03:08.682
- I'm joking. No, but seriously,
- Yeah. Joke. Seriously,

03:08.750 --> 03:10.651
- get back to work. Yeah.
- Get back to work. Yeah.

03:11.419 --> 03:13.086
I know this isn't
gonna end well,

03:13.154 --> 03:15.755
but the whole middle part's
gonna be awesome.

03:15.823 --> 03:17.624
- Good for you.
- What?

03:17.691 --> 03:19.959
Schmidt, stop drinking that.

03:21.028 --> 03:22.562
I'm gonna
take care of this.

03:22.630 --> 03:24.531
WINSTON:
<i>If I feel down, I come here.</i>

03:24.598 --> 03:27.401
I love this place, man.
You know, the sound of bubbles,

03:27.468 --> 03:29.468
soothing synth music.

03:29.536 --> 03:31.103
If this place doesn't
take your mind off of Cece,

03:31.171 --> 03:32.138
then I don't know, man.

03:32.205 --> 03:34.407
Look at that.

03:37.511 --> 03:38.444
So beautiful.

03:38.512 --> 03:40.112
And exotic.

03:40.180 --> 03:41.813
Perfect curves.

03:41.881 --> 03:44.450
Giant almond eyes.

03:44.518 --> 03:46.418
Caramel-colored stripes.

03:46.485 --> 03:47.519
Sumptuous lips.

03:49.355 --> 03:51.222
Are you talking about the fish?

03:51.990 --> 03:53.958
Excuse me.
You, sir, that works here.

03:54.026 --> 03:55.726
What is this fish-- the one
that floats like an angel?

03:55.794 --> 03:57.462
How much for this one?

03:57.530 --> 04:00.598
Ah, that is the lovely but
elusive California lionfish.

04:00.666 --> 04:02.132
It's perfect.
I must have it.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.967
(Chuckles)
S-Sadly, sir, you can't.

04:04.035 --> 04:06.036
- What do you mean I can't?
- It's... illegal, sir.

04:06.104 --> 04:08.505
This fish is protected by
the great state of California.

04:08.573 --> 04:10.006
Gimme it!

04:10.075 --> 04:10.707
No...?

04:13.744 --> 04:16.680
What are you doing? Why can't I
have the things that I want?

04:16.747 --> 04:17.646
WINSTON: Sorry about that.
SCHMIDT: Don't look at the fish, kids.

04:17.714 --> 04:18.914
You can't have any of them!

04:18.982 --> 04:20.283
None of them are for sale!

04:20.350 --> 04:22.385
Love is a lie.
It is.

04:22.453 --> 04:24.653
WINSTON: Calm down!
SCHMIDT: Love is a lie. Love is a lie.

04:24.721 --> 04:26.201
WINSTON: We're leaving.
We're leaving.

04:27.524 --> 04:29.058
(Sighs)

04:29.126 --> 04:31.060
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

04:31.128 --> 04:34.229
Schmidt, no.
Absolutely not.

04:34.297 --> 04:36.431
No!
I don't trust fish.

04:36.499 --> 04:38.266
They breathe water--
that's crazy.

04:38.334 --> 04:39.734
WINSTON: Yeah, he's got
a whole thing going.

04:39.802 --> 04:40.868
Schmidt-- an aquarium?!

04:40.936 --> 04:42.437
When did you become
a Bond villain

04:42.505 --> 04:44.172
that couldn't afford not
to live with roommates?

04:44.240 --> 04:45.773
This is where I will keep
my lionfish.

04:45.841 --> 04:47.008
- Your lionfish?
- A rare beauty.

04:47.076 --> 04:49.010
The result of generations

04:49.078 --> 04:50.744
of interracial fish breeding.

04:50.812 --> 04:53.180
Just undulating in that water
with that wry smile.

04:53.248 --> 04:54.848
Perfect, round fish breasts.

04:54.916 --> 04:56.950
- Pull it together.
- What is this hat?

04:57.018 --> 04:58.119
They say it'll be impossible
for me to have it.

04:58.186 --> 04:59.853
But I'll get it.
She will be mine, and...

04:59.921 --> 05:01.188
we will create a life together.

05:03.291 --> 05:04.925
-  We're not talking about
fish here, are we?    - No.

05:04.993 --> 05:06.193
- Clearly talking about Cece.
- Yes.

05:06.260 --> 05:07.660
Yeah, 'cause he said
"fish breasts."

05:07.694 --> 05:09.496
- He said "fish breasts."
- Yeah.

05:09.563 --> 05:11.197
I mean, fish don't have boobs.

05:12.265 --> 05:13.433
Hmm?

05:13.501 --> 05:15.968
- Hey, Jess.
- That's my name. What's yours?

05:16.036 --> 05:18.138
Just kidding. I know what it is.
It's Nick.

05:19.205 --> 05:20.607
You okay?

05:21.205 --> 05:22.507
- Yeah.
- You haven't stopped moving

05:22.508 --> 05:24.876
 - since we've been talking.
- Hmm?

05:24.944 --> 05:26.211
It's a nice-looking dress.
You look good in it.

05:26.279 --> 05:29.014
(Laughing):
Oh, God. Okay.

05:33.218 --> 05:36.888
NICK:
Jess! Jess, wait!

05:36.956 --> 05:40.557
Jess... Jess,
would you please wait?

05:40.625 --> 05:41.792
Hey, I was wondering,

05:41.860 --> 05:43.193
can I get a ride
to the hardware store?

05:43.261 --> 05:44.828
I want to throw
a punching bag up

05:44.896 --> 05:46.664
at the bar for Guys' Night,

05:46.731 --> 05:48.732
but my car's not working,
so can I get a ride?

05:48.800 --> 05:51.536
- No. Mm-mm. No.
- Come on, can I please have a ride?

05:52.103 --> 05:55.405
Wait, hold on.
Don't move. Hold on.

05:55.473 --> 05:57.207
(Chuckles) You got an eyelash.
- Why do you

05:57.275 --> 05:59.176
- smell so good?
- It's 'cause I did laundry.

05:59.243 --> 06:01.244
Ah. I smell like a
baby in a damn meadow.

06:01.312 --> 06:04.947
- Look at this. My underwear.
- What? What?

06:05.015 --> 06:07.651
 -They're blue now. I think it's 'cause
I put colors in the whites. - Uh-huh.

06:07.718 --> 06:10.085
I'm still figuring it out, but I'm
really excited about laundry.

06:10.153 --> 06:12.087
- Good job. - Hey, how do you
put your underwear back in?

06:12.155 --> 06:15.191
Just... I feel like it's too
big to get back in now.

06:15.258 --> 06:16.625
It's tricky to get it in.

06:16.693 --> 06:17.826
(Sighs)

06:17.894 --> 06:19.761
- Fine!
- Thank you.

06:19.829 --> 06:21.297
Do you mind if we stop along
the way? I'm thinking of getting

06:21.364 --> 06:22.498
a salad 'cause I want
to eat healthier.

06:22.566 --> 06:24.233
Oh! God! Nick!

06:24.301 --> 06:25.533
I'm thinking

06:25.601 --> 06:28.369
- of taking a vitamin today.
- Oh, God! Shut up!

06:36.521 --> 06:39.956
(Grunting)

06:40.024 --> 06:41.557
It's good.

06:41.625 --> 06:43.726
(Drill whirrs)

06:43.794 --> 06:47.430
(Grunting)

06:47.498 --> 06:49.332
WOMAN:
Yeah.

06:49.400 --> 06:52.168
Yank that chain.

06:52.536 --> 06:54.503
Yank it.

07:00.310 --> 07:01.644
(Exhales)

07:01.712 --> 07:04.714
I feel like Russell Crowe
in every movie he's ever done.

07:04.782 --> 07:07.750
- All right, Nick. Um, we have to go.
- We just got here.

07:07.818 --> 07:10.084
- We have tons of stuff
we need to get.    - Fine.

07:10.152 --> 07:12.754
- Let me see what we have left.
- A whole bunch of stuff.

07:12.822 --> 07:16.057
Long-shafted... drive drill?

07:16.625 --> 07:18.493
New nut wrench?

07:18.561 --> 07:19.761
Our old nut wrench is bad.

07:19.829 --> 07:21.830
Quick-hardening... caulk.

07:21.898 --> 07:23.331
You don't want to wait forever
for that caulk to harden.

07:23.399 --> 07:25.566
Lube for... drill shaft.

07:25.634 --> 07:28.502
And we-- also, can we get a
box of gummy sharks? (Groans)

07:30.472 --> 07:32.506
(Sighs)

07:32.574 --> 07:35.810
Just remember... you caught him
pleasuring himself

07:35.877 --> 07:38.579
to a mail-order steak catalogue.

07:38.647 --> 07:39.880
(Sighs)

07:39.948 --> 07:41.781
NICK:
Hey, Jess, I need the cart!

07:41.849 --> 07:43.015
(Groans)

07:44.051 --> 07:44.984
Look what I found!

07:45.052 --> 07:47.854
Look at this big ol' pipe.

07:47.922 --> 07:49.456
(Shouts)
(Grunts)

07:53.928 --> 07:56.896
Check it out, Schmidt--
I got you a clownfish.

07:56.964 --> 08:00.532
I don't want some janky
freshwater bitch fish, Winston.

08:00.600 --> 08:02.167
I want a lionfish.

08:02.234 --> 08:03.368
Let's just cut through the crap,

08:03.436 --> 08:04.570
okay, Schmidt?
We both know

08:04.637 --> 08:06.371
what you really want is Cece.

08:06.439 --> 08:08.239
- Cece the woman?
- Yeah.

08:08.307 --> 08:10.108
You can't put a woman
in a fish tank, Winston.

08:10.142 --> 08:11.643
That doesn't make any sense.

08:11.711 --> 08:13.178
Look, Winston,
if there was

08:13.245 --> 08:14.912
one thing that stood
between you and happiness,

08:14.980 --> 08:17.615
don't you think I would be there
to help you get it?

08:17.683 --> 08:19.817
- No matter how stupid it was?
- You're right, Schmidt.

08:19.885 --> 08:21.486
If I was doing something stupid,

08:21.553 --> 08:22.887
you definitely
would be involved.

08:22.955 --> 08:24.655
Yeah, you're damn right
I would be.

08:24.723 --> 08:27.091
And I would probably be there
to make it even stupider.

08:27.158 --> 08:30.527
Now, I'm going to
walk out that door,

08:30.595 --> 08:34.063
and I'm gonna pursue
the object of my dreams.

08:34.131 --> 08:37.010
And if you don't want to join me, then
I'm gonna carry that weight alone.

08:38.034 --> 08:39.434
I'm in.

08:39.504 --> 08:41.571
Let's get you a lionfish.
Where do we start?

08:41.639 --> 08:43.106
- We're gonna start at the source.
- The ocean.

08:44.173 --> 08:46.141
That's an even better idea.

08:48.812 --> 08:50.846
(Door opens)

08:50.914 --> 08:52.581
NICK:
Hey, Jess.

08:52.649 --> 08:54.282
I got some hot soup.

08:54.350 --> 08:56.952
I feel good...
(Chuckles)

08:57.020 --> 08:59.187
Jessy feel good...

09:00.255 --> 09:01.456
Mmm.

09:01.524 --> 09:03.925
I like to say words
with my mouth.

09:03.993 --> 09:05.860
Well, your jaw is super bruised,

09:05.928 --> 09:07.529
so you need to get some rest.
But you have some

09:07.596 --> 09:08.830
fun pain meds.

09:09.398 --> 09:10.297
Right?

09:10.365 --> 09:14.035
- I like you.
- Yeah, I like you, too, Jess.

09:14.102 --> 09:16.871
- Yeah... and I like, your little bubble belly.
- Oh, thank you.

09:16.939 --> 09:20.106
Blows up like a... bubble.

09:20.174 --> 09:21.441
Yeah, that's what it does.

09:21.509 --> 09:24.777
I want to have sex with you!

09:24.845 --> 09:26.213
Okay.

09:26.281 --> 09:28.480
I want to have sex with you.

09:28.481 --> 09:30.651
Whoa, do you know
what you're saying right now, Jess?

09:30.718 --> 09:32.553
Yeah.

09:32.620 --> 09:33.654
Are you sure?

09:33.721 --> 09:35.588
I want to have sex with you.

09:36.156 --> 09:39.659
Sexy time for you, says me.

09:39.726 --> 09:43.729
You are a beautiful white man,
Nick Miller.

09:43.797 --> 09:44.797
Okay.

09:44.865 --> 09:46.299
- Read all about it.
- Yeah.

09:46.367 --> 09:48.501
- I'm Judy Garland.
- Yeah, so it's the pills.

09:48.569 --> 09:50.036
This is nonsense.

09:50.103 --> 09:52.737
Whoa! Jess, hey, hey, hey,
no, no, no, no, no...

09:52.805 --> 09:55.174
Heck, no... no...

09:55.241 --> 09:58.043
- Don't do this right now.
- I'm Judy Garland.

09:58.111 --> 10:00.712
Hey, Judy,
let's get you to bed, doll.

10:00.780 --> 10:03.549
Whoa, whoa! You are way too
drugged-up for this... okay...

10:03.616 --> 10:05.917
This little piggy
went to the market.

10:05.985 --> 10:08.219
- That little piggy can't be touched
by you right now. - This little piggy

10:08.287 --> 10:11.189
went... (Laughs)... this
little piggy went to market!

10:11.256 --> 10:13.558
(Nick screaming)

10:13.625 --> 10:16.594
It's hot! I put my hand
in the hot soup!

10:16.661 --> 10:18.996
Ow! You... aah!

10:19.064 --> 10:22.665
(Pants, grunts)

10:23.433 --> 10:25.302
Hey, Nick!

10:25.369 --> 10:29.106
Will you be a doll
and get me some mustard?

10:32.216 --> 10:34.517
<i>That is not flattering on you.</i>
<i> You're an incredibly lovely man.</i>

10:34.585 --> 10:36.118
- Are you calling my phone?
- Yeah, I'm calling it right now, Winston.

10:36.686 --> 10:39.021
I can't find it.
(Phone buzzing)

10:39.089 --> 10:41.590
Are you kidding me?
Damn it, Winston!

10:41.658 --> 10:44.459
- It took me 20 minutes to fit this thing
over your hips. - Whoa, okay. Hey! Hey!

10:44.527 --> 10:46.428
- Careful! Hey! What are you...
- Why is your waist so weird?

10:46.496 --> 10:48.929
- That's my ass cheek! Sch-Schmidt!
- I'm getting your phone.

10:48.930 --> 10:50.698
(Laughs) That kind of tickles.
NICK: Hey! Stop saying

10:50.766 --> 10:53.067
"That's my ass cheek"
and stop touching his butt!

10:53.135 --> 10:55.069
- Look at that shiner.
- Not cool!

10:55.137 --> 10:57.672
Somebody messes with my boy,
that means we mean "bid-ness"!

10:57.739 --> 10:59.874
We doing this?
Let's do this!

10:59.942 --> 11:01.409
Are we not... are we not
doing it? It doesn't feel like

11:01.476 --> 11:02.977
- you guys want to do it.
- Let's just say

11:03.045 --> 11:04.845
hypothetically that a girl
says something

11:04.913 --> 11:06.514
to you
while she's on painkillers.

11:06.631 --> 11:08.298
- Mm-hmm.
- And that girl says that she might want

11:08.366 --> 11:11.134
to have sexual intercourse
with you.

11:11.202 --> 11:12.803
Please tell me
we're not talking about Jess.

11:12.871 --> 11:15.405
And you had no idea
that's how she felt.

11:15.473 --> 11:16.540
Like, no idea.
You thought

11:16.608 --> 11:17.708
the door was closed.

11:17.776 --> 11:19.097
In fact, you thought
that door was

11:19.110 --> 11:21.778
so closed that you went out
to another door,

11:21.845 --> 11:23.312
but had I known that the
first door was open,

11:23.380 --> 11:24.981
that's the door I
wanted to walk through.

11:25.049 --> 11:27.050
- Wait, okay, wait...
- I would've walked through that door.

11:27.117 --> 11:28.317
Do you see how
I'm in a tough spot?

11:28.385 --> 11:29.418
Can we stop calling it
"walking through a door"?

11:29.486 --> 11:30.419
Because for me, I feel like it's

11:30.487 --> 11:31.921
more like sliding past a drape.

11:31.989 --> 11:33.222
Okay, if a girl on painkillers

11:33.290 --> 11:34.724
says that she wants
to have sex with you,

11:34.792 --> 11:36.058
- Mm-hmm.
- is that the drugs or is that real?

11:36.125 --> 11:37.459
And if so,

11:37.526 --> 11:40.228
how do I end it with Shane
before Jess finds out?

11:40.296 --> 11:42.197
(Stammering):
I-I-I meant the door.

11:42.264 --> 11:43.732
(Clears throat)
Nick, Jess...

11:43.800 --> 11:45.200
NICK: All right,
good talking, guys.

11:45.201 --> 11:46.468
- Good stuff. Yeah, I love that.
- Hey, guys.

11:46.469 --> 11:47.502
What happened to your eye?

11:47.570 --> 11:49.905
You smashed me
in the face, remember?

11:49.973 --> 11:51.073
- Right here.
- That's funny.

11:51.140 --> 11:52.807
Seriously, what happened?

11:52.874 --> 11:54.475
Is your jaw okay?
I bit my face.

11:54.542 --> 11:55.476
Oh, you know what?

11:55.543 --> 11:56.944
I can't even feel it.

11:57.012 --> 11:58.212
The doctor's got me

11:58.279 --> 11:59.714
so goofy on these
painkillers,

11:59.781 --> 12:01.515
it's like it never happened.

12:01.583 --> 12:02.650
(Whispers): It's like it
never happened.

12:02.718 --> 12:04.785
But I sure got a chin shiner.

12:04.853 --> 12:06.687
(Chuckles): Yeah, you do.
- Right?

12:06.755 --> 12:08.387
So, I'll see you at Guys' Night.

12:08.455 --> 12:10.056
- Uh, no, no, no, you...
- I don't...

12:10.124 --> 12:12.358
- I think you should rest.
- Yeah, girl, you gotta protect that face.

12:12.426 --> 12:13.326
Yeah, hey, for real,
you should stay home

12:13.393 --> 12:14.327
and you should rest, Jess.

12:14.394 --> 12:15.428
That's so sweet.

12:15.496 --> 12:16.329
Thanks, guys.

12:22.636 --> 12:24.069
What are doing out here?

12:25.138 --> 12:26.071
This is crazy.

12:26.072 --> 12:27.640
We've been standing
in the ocean for two hours

12:27.641 --> 12:28.841
trying to steal an illegal fish.

12:28.908 --> 12:30.275
I don't know why you want

12:30.343 --> 12:31.943
that damn fish so bad.

12:32.011 --> 12:34.679
But what I do know is that
it's gonna make you happy.

12:34.747 --> 12:36.181
And that's all
I care about.

12:36.249 --> 12:37.449
Remember, I'm the one
who shaved your shoulders

12:37.517 --> 12:38.997
after you got
that scoop-neck sweater.

12:39.051 --> 12:40.918
- I appreciate it.
- I'd do the same to find

12:40.986 --> 12:43.755
whatever it is
that makes you happy.

12:43.822 --> 12:45.123
You want to lose
that last 55 pounds,

12:45.191 --> 12:46.257
I'll help you do that.

12:46.324 --> 12:47.524
I don't got 50 pounds to lose.

12:47.526 --> 12:49.426
It's very evident
in this outfit.

12:49.494 --> 12:50.427
Right there.
I see something.

12:50.495 --> 12:51.595
Lionfish!

12:51.663 --> 12:53.697
Son of a...

12:56.167 --> 12:57.434
(Shrieks)

12:57.502 --> 12:58.802
- What the...?
- Jellyfish!

12:58.870 --> 12:59.603
- What?
- Jellyfish!

12:59.671 --> 13:00.804
Whoa, Schmidt.

13:00.872 --> 13:01.938
- Jellyfish!
- What happened?

13:02.006 --> 13:03.173
(Screams)

13:03.240 --> 13:04.907
- It got me, it got me!
- What do I do?

13:04.975 --> 13:06.255
- What do I do?
- It got me, Winston!

13:06.277 --> 13:07.743
- It burns!
- Okay!

13:07.811 --> 13:09.546
- Burns!
- So what do I do?

13:09.613 --> 13:11.681
- I need you to pee on my face.
- What?

13:11.748 --> 13:13.049
- You need to pee on my face.
- I can't.

13:13.116 --> 13:14.551
It will sterilize the wound.
Please do it, Winston.

13:14.618 --> 13:15.818
I can <i>not</i> pee on your face.

13:15.886 --> 13:17.086
I thought you were
with me to the end.

13:17.154 --> 13:18.520
I just peed in the ocean,
so I'm all out.

13:18.588 --> 13:19.688
You peed in the ocean?

13:19.755 --> 13:21.390
- Yeah, look...
- Disgusting!

13:21.457 --> 13:23.458
Okay, look, look, I know
this is a dumb question,

13:23.526 --> 13:24.893
but will number two help?

13:25.360 --> 13:26.195
What?

13:26.262 --> 13:28.129
♪
♪
(Guys shouting jubilantly)

13:28.198 --> 13:29.298
(Guy belches loudly)

13:30.365 --> 13:32.601
Free beers, Gorilla
Bowl of nachos.

13:32.669 --> 13:34.268
Gonna be two dozen
dollars, boys.

13:35.036 --> 13:37.705
Didn't realize we could make
a $22 profit on nachos.

13:37.772 --> 13:40.107
- Guys' Night is genius.
- Right?

13:40.175 --> 13:43.176
Hey, um, look, uh,
I think you're great,

13:43.244 --> 13:45.446
I just, uh, I can't keep...

13:47.481 --> 13:48.782
I can't keep running to get

13:48.850 --> 13:51.518
cheese every time
somebody orders nachos.

13:51.586 --> 13:52.852
I love how worked up
you get over cheese.

13:52.920 --> 13:54.287
Get down there. Run.

13:55.690 --> 13:57.324
Ooh...

13:57.391 --> 13:59.158
who do I have to do around here

13:59.227 --> 14:00.560
to get a bucket of nachos?

14:00.628 --> 14:01.928
Right here. Right here.
How you doing?

14:01.995 --> 14:03.963
- I wasn't serious.
- Wendell. Hi.

14:04.031 --> 14:05.632
Gentlemen...
There's a really literal

14:05.700 --> 14:07.533
- vibe around here.
- What are you doing here?

14:07.601 --> 14:09.167
This morning you said
you weren't coming, Jess.

14:09.236 --> 14:11.037
I actually don't remember
this morning at all.

14:11.104 --> 14:13.504
- But I would never miss this. I'm
so proud of you.    - Free beers!

14:13.506 --> 14:14.940
Free beer.

14:15.007 --> 14:16.208
You guys went through those!

14:16.276 --> 14:17.776
- Wait a minute...
- More free beers.

14:17.844 --> 14:20.912
Guys' Night is men
drink for free?

14:20.980 --> 14:24.115
- Well, it's Guys' Night.
- Oh.

14:24.182 --> 14:25.617
You know...

14:25.684 --> 14:27.485
I...

14:27.553 --> 14:29.887
it's not a really good idea.

14:30.455 --> 14:33.491
You know, because women
won't show up, and...

14:34.826 --> 14:35.860
You know?

14:35.927 --> 14:37.027
He's our little idea man.

14:37.095 --> 14:39.496
- Hey... (Chuckles)
SHANE: So full of ideas.

14:39.564 --> 14:40.864
She just slap your ass?

14:40.931 --> 14:41.898
Sure. She's like a...

14:41.966 --> 14:43.533
she's my boss and like a coach.

14:43.601 --> 14:44.868
We're a team here.

14:44.935 --> 14:46.436
We all slap each other's butts

14:46.504 --> 14:47.671
all the time.

14:47.739 --> 14:50.140
Right here!
Keep up the good work!

14:50.207 --> 14:52.276
Why don't you go get us
some ice, Big Bob?

14:52.343 --> 14:53.744
Just slap my butt, Big Bob.

14:53.811 --> 14:54.977
Show me some butt love.

14:55.044 --> 14:56.044
Fire me off!

14:56.112 --> 14:57.313
Some butt love?

14:57.381 --> 14:58.714
SHANE:
Take a slice of that.

14:58.782 --> 14:59.915
NICK:
Oh, you got right up in there.

14:59.983 --> 15:01.049
Hey, hey...

15:01.117 --> 15:02.184
Oh, Shane, Shane, Shane...

15:02.252 --> 15:03.452
Wait...

15:04.520 --> 15:05.087
Is she...?

15:05.155 --> 15:06.255
(Chuckles) No.
- Uh, yeah.

15:06.323 --> 15:07.556
- Are you...?
- No. Yeah. Yeah.

15:07.624 --> 15:09.492
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We're sleeping together.

15:09.559 --> 15:11.259
- So what?
- We're <i>all</i> sleeping together.

15:11.327 --> 15:12.527
Big Bob is...

15:15.665 --> 15:16.331
I'm sorry, Jess.

15:16.399 --> 15:17.332
Why... I mean,

15:17.400 --> 15:18.300
why are you sorry?

15:18.367 --> 15:19.701
You're a free man.

15:19.769 --> 15:21.090
Just... you're just...
you know...

15:21.103 --> 15:22.904
getting some stank on it.

15:22.971 --> 15:25.307
Did you really just say
that to me in my own bar?

15:25.374 --> 15:26.907
- Nick, who is this?
JESS: Yeah, Nick,

15:26.974 --> 15:28.375
who am I?

15:28.443 --> 15:30.043
Shane, this is Jess.

15:30.811 --> 15:32.579
She's my, uh...

15:33.647 --> 15:34.415
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

15:34.482 --> 15:35.248
NICK:
Yeah.

15:35.917 --> 15:38.852
Hmm... my room... friend.

15:38.920 --> 15:42.323
I'm your "room friend," Nick?

15:42.390 --> 15:44.257
Jess, don't...

15:44.325 --> 15:45.892
I'm sleeping with Nick, too.

15:45.960 --> 15:47.861
You don't have to do this, Bob.

15:47.929 --> 15:49.296
I have to go.

15:49.363 --> 15:51.131
Big Bob, that was
really sweet.

15:51.499 --> 15:52.398
Thank you, Bob!

15:52.466 --> 15:53.433
Jess, wait!

15:57.576 --> 15:59.176
- Hey, hey.
- What are you doing here?

15:59.243 --> 16:00.943
He left me a voicemail
from the ambulance.

16:01.011 --> 16:03.145
He was rambling a lot,
but I brought him this.

16:03.214 --> 16:04.314
- Whoa, where'd you get that?
- You know,

16:04.381 --> 16:05.748
one of the perks
of being a model.

16:05.816 --> 16:07.183
You get to meet
a lot of sketchy people.

16:07.251 --> 16:09.619
The guy who got me this
also said he could get me

16:09.687 --> 16:12.755
a box of dolphin steaks
or a mostly white baby.

16:12.823 --> 16:13.956
Good to know.

16:14.024 --> 16:15.057
How's he doing?

16:16.125 --> 16:17.459
Uh, hey,

16:17.527 --> 16:19.194
listen, I think it might be
good for him

16:19.262 --> 16:21.363
if you just gave him some space.

16:21.431 --> 16:22.831
Space?

16:22.898 --> 16:24.199
(Sighs)

16:24.267 --> 16:25.467
Cece, you're getting married.

16:26.502 --> 16:28.970
It's killing him.

16:30.538 --> 16:32.005
- Okay.
- Yeah.

16:32.073 --> 16:33.608
- Um, just tell him I came...
- Mm-hmm.

16:34.175 --> 16:37.478
- ...by, or... or not.
- Uh-huh.

16:37.546 --> 16:39.680
(Sighs)

16:39.748 --> 16:41.014
He's waking up.
You should go.

16:41.082 --> 16:43.584
- Okay.
- You know... roommate.

16:52.926 --> 16:54.127
Winston.

16:54.194 --> 16:56.363
Hmm?

16:56.430 --> 16:57.830
I just realized something.

16:58.866 --> 17:00.767
It was never about a fish.

17:01.834 --> 17:03.202
It was a metaphor.

17:04.270 --> 17:05.337
It was about Cece.

17:05.905 --> 17:07.005
Don't feel bad about
not seeing it.

17:07.073 --> 17:08.940
Look, man, it was
subtle as hell.

17:09.008 --> 17:11.342
Oh, my God, is that a lionfish?

17:11.410 --> 17:12.443
Where'd that come from?

17:12.511 --> 17:13.811
The...

17:13.880 --> 17:15.146
The lion... the lionfish?

17:15.214 --> 17:17.015
(Stammers):
You. That came from you.

17:17.083 --> 17:18.083
When the paramedics
came, you...

17:18.151 --> 17:19.817
you had it in your hand.

17:19.885 --> 17:21.318
They were like, "Whoa, you
can't get one of these."

17:21.386 --> 17:22.586
And I was like,
"He caught it

17:22.654 --> 17:25.890
in a..." You did it.
(Chuckles)

17:26.457 --> 17:28.025
Hello, fish Cece.

17:28.994 --> 17:30.594
Gonna put you back in the sea.

17:30.662 --> 17:31.962
I'm sorry, what?
Look, Winston,

17:32.030 --> 17:33.750
I don't know if it was
the jellyfish's venom

17:33.799 --> 17:34.799
or the paramedic's urine, but

17:34.866 --> 17:36.032
it made me realize...

17:37.501 --> 17:39.068
...she's not mine to keep.

17:39.136 --> 17:40.703
She belongs out there.

17:40.771 --> 17:42.238
In the great, wide open ocean.

17:44.508 --> 17:46.509
Uh, Schmidt,

17:46.576 --> 17:47.476
that don't go to the ocean.

17:47.544 --> 17:49.712
What are you, the city planner?

17:55.352 --> 17:56.519
Hi.

18:00.524 --> 18:02.024
Well, I've got some
explaining to do.

18:02.091 --> 18:04.026
Shut up.

18:05.946 --> 18:08.180
I'm really happy
her name is Shane.

18:08.247 --> 18:09.448
- Mm... mm-hmm.
- Who's next?

18:09.515 --> 18:10.449
Cody?

18:10.516 --> 18:11.516
(Chuckles)

18:11.584 --> 18:13.185
- Tex? The sheriff?
- Mm.

18:14.587 --> 18:15.887
Hey, Jess...

18:15.955 --> 18:17.122
last night,

18:17.190 --> 18:18.756
when you were on pills...

18:19.858 --> 18:21.560
...you said you want me.

18:21.627 --> 18:22.427
(Scoffing):
Shut up.

18:22.495 --> 18:23.795
You put your hand in my pocket.

18:23.862 --> 18:24.962
- No, I didn't...
- You said, "This little piggy

18:25.029 --> 18:26.130
wants to go to the market."

18:26.198 --> 18:27.431
- Shut up, Nick.
- It's something you were

18:27.499 --> 18:28.799
just saying, that's fine,
that's cool,

18:28.866 --> 18:30.534
we'll move on
and not talk about it,

18:30.602 --> 18:32.562
but it is something
that I've thought a lot about.

18:32.571 --> 18:34.037
But you were never
clear about that,

18:34.106 --> 18:34.938
so that there were
other options.

18:35.006 --> 18:36.006
And this little piggy

18:36.074 --> 18:37.141
ran around to different markets,

18:37.209 --> 18:38.375
but he didn't know.

18:38.443 --> 18:39.643
What are you talking about?

18:39.711 --> 18:41.411
Do you want to have sex
with me, yes or no?

18:41.479 --> 18:42.045
Yes!

18:43.414 --> 18:46.316
No! Yes! I mean, I did.

18:46.383 --> 18:47.618
But that was before I knew

18:47.685 --> 18:49.285
that you were...
you were doing all that

18:49.353 --> 18:50.921
for your boss,
so you sleep with her.

18:50.989 --> 18:52.889
- Fine, forget-forget the boss.
- Okay.

18:52.957 --> 18:54.457
Well, I just, you know,
I thought it was...

18:54.525 --> 18:56.159
it was nice to see you

18:56.227 --> 18:59.028
actually trying at something.

18:59.796 --> 19:00.763
So...

19:00.831 --> 19:02.632
That's why you were
more attracted to me?

19:03.700 --> 19:05.100
- Wait a second.
- I thought it was

19:05.102 --> 19:06.902
- attractive that you were trying.
- That's why?

19:06.970 --> 19:08.738
You're a frickin'
gold digger, Jess.

19:08.805 --> 19:10.572
- What?!
- I think that's what you just said.

19:10.641 --> 19:12.108
If I were a gold digger,

19:12.175 --> 19:13.842
do you think I'd be
interested in you?

19:13.909 --> 19:16.611
I would be the worst
gold digger in the world.

19:16.679 --> 19:17.746
You're a friggin' gold digger.

19:17.813 --> 19:19.014
No, I'm not, Nick.

19:19.081 --> 19:20.515
- I'm so disappointed in you.
- Shut up!

19:20.582 --> 19:22.917
I'm not a gold digger.

19:24.120 --> 19:25.754
Then prove it.

19:33.995 --> 19:35.829
♪ ♪

19:39.768 --> 19:41.869
(Both moaning passionately)

19:43.838 --> 19:45.371
- Ow! My jaw.
- What?

19:45.438 --> 19:46.539
Then move your damn head.

19:46.606 --> 19:48.207
Then kiss me like a man!

19:50.377 --> 19:51.377
(Nick groans)

19:51.444 --> 19:52.779
Damn it!

19:52.846 --> 19:54.047
- What's wrong with your hand?
- I burnt it

19:54.114 --> 19:55.414
in your damn soup.
Is that what you wanted...

19:55.482 --> 19:57.283
Well, who burns
their hand in soup?

19:57.350 --> 19:58.284
I do!

19:58.351 --> 20:00.086
You're a mess!

20:00.154 --> 20:02.220
You are so annoying with your
little shorts.

20:02.288 --> 20:04.089
Why are you so angry
all the time?

20:04.157 --> 20:05.824
I told you, shut up.

20:05.892 --> 20:07.058
Shut up and take off
your clothes right now.

20:07.125 --> 20:08.659
And I mean it,
take off your clothes.

20:08.727 --> 20:11.562
You're just chaotic.
Everywhere you go.

20:11.629 --> 20:12.830
Stop talking!

20:12.898 --> 20:14.165
- Wherever you go! You are--
-This is not

20:14.232 --> 20:16.112
the time to talk, that is
the stupidest thing...

20:17.069 --> 20:18.268
Oh...

20:27.812 --> 20:29.679
I'm gonna grab
some paper towels.

20:30.247 --> 20:33.316
An aquarium the size
of a sixth grader just broke,

20:33.383 --> 20:35.051
and you're grabbing
paper towels?

20:35.119 --> 20:36.319
Yes, I'm getting paper towels.

20:36.353 --> 20:38.354
- What are you thinking?!
- Okay, you know what?

20:38.422 --> 20:39.988
- I'm out.  -  You can't clean
this up with paper towels.

20:40.056 --> 20:41.289
- I'm not...
- You don't want to clean it up.

20:41.357 --> 20:42.791
- No, that's not what it is.
- Well, you know what?

20:42.859 --> 20:44.492
If you're not cleaning it up,
I do not want to be told...

20:44.560 --> 20:46.294
- I'm not cleaning it up.
- ...what to do, by you, right this second!

20:46.362 --> 20:48.130
- I'm not... just 'cause I'm a woman?
- That's it! I'm out!

20:48.198 --> 20:49.397
Please.

20:49.465 --> 20:50.766
(Doors slamming)

20:50.834 --> 20:52.801
(Doors opening)

21:00.175 --> 21:02.343
- You piss me off!
- This is a bad idea.

21:02.410 --> 21:03.778
(Doors slam)

21:04.346 --> 21:05.679
I know you're going out
into the ocean

21:05.748 --> 21:07.148
lionfish, but...

21:07.216 --> 21:08.850
I ever see you
again, then...

21:08.917 --> 21:11.818
well...

21:12.386 --> 21:15.956
And should you meet
a charming... (Sniffs)

21:16.023 --> 21:18.491
physically fit, what-- I don't
know, whatever kind of fish

21:18.559 --> 21:19.559
gefilte fish come from...

21:21.362 --> 21:22.295
Treat him well.

21:25.699 --> 21:26.432
Be careful.

21:30.971 --> 21:32.571
You gotta be kidding me!

21:32.639 --> 21:34.006
- Oh, shoot.
- Stay alive!

21:34.074 --> 21:36.675
