01:06.833 --> 01:09.631
<i>I couldn't really remember</i>
<i>what Germany was like.</i>

01:09.903 --> 01:12.565
<i>I knew they had snow and seasons...</i>

01:12.972 --> 01:14.564
<i>and our family had lived there.</i>

01:14.707 --> 01:17.767
<i>Not only Mama and Papa,</i>
<i>but the whole family.</i>

01:18.311 --> 01:20.040
<i>And it was nice.</i>

01:24.984 --> 01:27.509
<i>But I also remember</i>
<i>that I was always afraid...</i>

01:28.021 --> 01:30.012
<i>of other children and people...</i>

01:30.256 --> 01:31.587
<i>and even dogs.</i>

01:32.425 --> 01:33.449
Watch out!

01:39.132 --> 01:41.600
Come here. Let me help you.

01:50.877 --> 01:54.472
NOWHERE IN AFRICA

01:56.082 --> 01:58.175
<i>I remember Germany as a dark place.</i>

01:58.651 --> 02:00.380
<i>Not as bright and hot as Kenya.</i>

02:00.820 --> 02:03.653
<i>A place with large buildings</i>
<i>and dismal rooms.</i>

02:04.057 --> 02:06.491
<i>Papa always says, "Germany is our home."</i>

02:06.826 --> 02:09.192
<i>I think he just misses his father...</i>

02:09.562 --> 02:10.926
<i>my grandfather.</i>

02:10.997 --> 02:14.489
<i>He couldn't eat cookies with nuts,</i>
<i>because he was allergic.</i>

02:14.901 --> 02:17.461
<i>He really liked Heinrich Heine's poems...</i>

02:17.670 --> 02:20.138
<i>especially the ones about Germany.</i>

02:23.710 --> 02:27.373
<i>I had two aunts in Germany</i>
<i>that I liked an awful lot.</i>

02:27.714 --> 02:30.774
<i>Aunt Käthe was Mama's sister.</i>
<i>Papa's sister was Liesl.</i>

02:30.950 --> 02:34.351
<i>Sometimes they helped out in Grandpa's</i>
<i>hotel, the "Adler" in Sohrau.</i>

02:35.522 --> 02:38.753
<i>That was in the good old days</i>
<i>before the Nazis came.</i>

02:47.634 --> 02:48.896
Can I help you?

02:50.403 --> 02:51.665
No, thank you.

03:07.320 --> 03:08.787
We have to go now.

03:13.293 --> 03:17.354
<i>The Nazis forbade Papa to work as a
<i>lawyer and took away Grandpa's hotel.</i></i>

03:18.164 --> 03:20.860
<i>Soon none of our family had a job.</i>

03:21.467 --> 03:25.130
<i>When I asked my parents why that was so,</i>
<i>I always got the same answer:</i>

03:26.472 --> 03:29.032
<i>"Because we're Jews, Regina. That's why."</i>

04:30.003 --> 04:31.129
What's wrong?

04:31.204 --> 04:32.831
An urgent message!

05:00.099 --> 05:01.259
Walter!

05:03.703 --> 05:04.795
Wake up!

05:05.271 --> 05:08.297
- This is quinine. It's good for you.
- Leave me alone!

05:08.775 --> 05:10.106
Come on! Wake up!

05:11.277 --> 05:12.744
Give me the coffee.

05:14.480 --> 05:15.538
Hurry!

05:19.986 --> 05:22.216
Good heavens, Walter, wake up!

05:38.204 --> 05:39.933
Come on, open your mouth!

05:47.246 --> 05:49.908
Breslau, January 1938

05:52.218 --> 05:55.813
- Jettel, can I have some apple juice?
- Ask Klara, please.

05:59.158 --> 06:02.389
Anna, I'm glad you could come
despite the snow. Come in.

06:03.930 --> 06:05.864
- Good evening, Mrs. Redlich.
- Good evening.

06:05.932 --> 06:07.024
Move it!

06:07.667 --> 06:09.430
Don't talk to Jews!

06:18.711 --> 06:20.736
Stop playing with those matches!

06:21.314 --> 06:24.715
- You're going to burn down the house!
- Sure thing, Klara!

06:29.288 --> 06:30.846
Here, a sausage.

06:31.624 --> 06:33.251
You gotta get used to it!

06:33.326 --> 06:35.385
Negroes always eat it black.

06:35.495 --> 06:38.293
- No, they don't.
- Or raw and bloody!

06:38.364 --> 06:41.527
I know they eat dogs
from my Geography book.

06:41.801 --> 06:44.998
They eat grasshoppers, too. Here, hold him.

06:45.905 --> 06:49.898
You wanna go to Africa?
You're even afraid to touch a dachshund.

06:50.810 --> 06:51.799
Grandpa!

06:53.546 --> 06:57.414
- Are there nuts in it?
- They're the only cookies I could get.

06:57.483 --> 07:00.941
- Oh, Klara.
- There aren't many nuts in them anyway.

07:01.154 --> 07:03.281
- You have to sneeze, right?
- Right.

07:03.356 --> 07:07.019
Every time I eat nuts I have to sneeze.
Every darn time.

07:10.730 --> 07:12.527
I really loved the green one.

07:13.666 --> 07:17.727
Walter bought me this for New Year's,
but it isn't really my style.

07:17.804 --> 07:19.601
I think it's very elegant.

07:19.739 --> 07:21.229
Then take it.

07:24.243 --> 07:26.711
You're such a sweetheart, Jettel. Thanks.

07:27.980 --> 07:30.608
Käthchen, don't cry today, okay?

07:31.217 --> 07:32.616
Do I dare to wear this?

07:32.785 --> 07:34.685
It fits your rear end!

07:34.787 --> 07:37.017
- Mrs. Redlich...
- Men like 'em round.

07:37.089 --> 07:38.556
That's for me!

07:38.624 --> 07:41.092
This is for you, Klara!
Glitter is what you need.

07:43.996 --> 07:45.395
Thank you.

07:45.965 --> 07:47.330
What's wrong?

07:48.534 --> 07:50.058
It's from Africa.

07:57.276 --> 08:00.905
<i>Rongai, Kenya, 2 December 1937.</i>

08:01.347 --> 08:02.780
<i>My beloved Jettel:</i>

08:02.849 --> 08:07.286
<i>I can imagine that this letter</i>
<i>will upset you, so try to be strong.</i>

08:08.020 --> 08:10.215
<i>Last week,</i>
<i>the Jewish community in Nairobi...</i>

08:10.289 --> 08:13.315
<i>agreed to pay for your immigration.</i>

08:13.392 --> 08:15.622
<i>After six months here...</i>

08:15.695 --> 08:18.721
<i>I'll finally be able</i>
<i>to organize the trip for you and Regina.</i>

08:21.234 --> 08:23.634
<i>I beg you not to wait another day.</i>

08:23.703 --> 08:25.568
<i>Go see Karl Silbermann at once.</i>

08:25.638 --> 08:28.004
<i>He can help you</i>
<i>with the tickets for the ship.</i>

08:29.342 --> 08:32.903
<i>It doesn't matter</i>
<i>what kind of ship or how long it takes.</i>

08:32.979 --> 08:34.344
<i>Just so it takes you.</i>

08:36.215 --> 08:38.808
<i>What we need here is a refrigerator.</i>

08:38.885 --> 08:43.049
<i>If it doesn't fit in our chests,</i>
<i>then throw out the Rosenthal china.</i>

08:43.289 --> 08:44.950
<i>It's useless here.</i>

08:45.057 --> 08:48.618
<i>Also, get kerosene lamps, mosquito nets...</i>

08:48.728 --> 08:50.958
<i>and sturdy shoes for you and Regina.</i>

08:51.464 --> 08:54.194
<i>Don't try to bring any cash</i>
<i>or jewelry with you.</i>

08:54.267 --> 08:58.670
<i>You know what Nazis do to smugglers.</i>
<i>And say as little as possible.</i>

08:58.971 --> 09:01.030
<i>There's no one you can trust...</i>

09:01.107 --> 09:03.940
<i>not even people we called our best friends.</i>

09:04.510 --> 09:09.277
<i>Oh, Jettel, my heart wants to burst</i>
<i>at the thought of embracing you two.</i>

09:10.082 --> 09:14.246
<i>But it grows heavy imagining how much</i>
<i>this letter will hurt your mother.</i>

09:19.492 --> 09:23.258
Walter, you've got malaria.

09:24.196 --> 09:27.131
You have to take this quinine.
It's very important.

09:28.200 --> 09:31.363
I have to get back to the farm.
Owuor will take care of you.

09:31.804 --> 09:34.329
He needs the quinine 3 times a day.

09:34.707 --> 09:36.868
3 times 40 drops.

09:42.415 --> 09:43.439
Understand?

09:43.849 --> 09:44.941
I understand.

10:00.933 --> 10:02.594
Max, we have to go!

10:03.536 --> 10:05.504
I hate having to say goodbye.

10:05.771 --> 10:08.239
I can't stand train stations either.

10:11.744 --> 10:14.542
This will all be over in one or two years.

10:24.223 --> 10:26.623
So you two are sticking together?

10:29.428 --> 10:32.363
Promise me that you'll stick it out together.

10:38.537 --> 10:42.303
One person always loves more.
That's what makes it so difficult.

10:44.610 --> 10:47.170
And the one who loves more is vulnerable.

10:54.587 --> 10:56.350
My son loves you...

10:57.723 --> 10:59.213
very much.

11:01.961 --> 11:04.452
I'm going to miss you so much, Max.

11:11.704 --> 11:13.262
Mama!

11:33.559 --> 11:36.585
Tell her goodbye, please.

12:32.585 --> 12:35.748
Eat this.
It will take the fire out of your body.

12:38.357 --> 12:39.824
Very good!

12:43.896 --> 12:47.354
- Ever heard of the "Silesian Heaven?"
- "Silesian?"

12:49.001 --> 12:52.664
Meat, potatoes,
bacon and dried fruit all mixed together.

12:54.707 --> 12:56.732
I don't understand a word!

13:01.547 --> 13:03.913
In my first life I was a lawyer.

14:41.013 --> 14:43.174
Owuor, this is for you.

14:44.383 --> 14:47.375
- You're giving me your coat?
- It's a robe.

14:49.088 --> 14:51.079
I was ill, and you looked after me.

14:51.657 --> 14:53.852
I am very grateful to you, Owuor.

14:55.661 --> 14:57.720
I wore the robe in my homeland.

14:59.999 --> 15:01.660
I wasn't a bwana there.

15:03.269 --> 15:05.635
I worked with my head.

15:09.008 --> 15:11.704
And here you don't want
to wear the robe anymore?

15:13.512 --> 15:15.537
You have to be smart to wear a robe.

15:15.648 --> 15:18.776
Here in Rongai you're smart. Not me.

15:23.188 --> 15:25.679
I'll have to say the word often...

15:25.758 --> 15:27.953
so I can pronounce it just like you do.

15:31.363 --> 15:32.830
Thank you.

15:38.404 --> 15:41.703
<i>We traveled 6 weeks</i>
<i>by steamship around Africa.</i>

15:42.274 --> 15:45.835
<i>On 20 April 1938, the Führer's birthday...</i>

15:45.911 --> 15:47.435
<i>we arrived in Nairobi.</i>

15:47.579 --> 15:49.479
Regina, take this please.

15:52.184 --> 15:53.446
Mrs. Redlich?

15:53.519 --> 15:57.182
<i>Mr. Morrison, who owned the cattle farm</i>
<i>where Papa worked...</i>

15:57.289 --> 15:59.348
<i>picked us up at the train station.</i>

16:22.948 --> 16:26.145
<i>It reminded me of chocolate</i>
<i>and what Mama told me on the ship.</i>

16:26.218 --> 16:27.685
<i>We were poor now.</i>

16:27.853 --> 16:30.754
<i>"So there's no chocolate for poor kids,"</i>
<i>she said.</i>

16:31.423 --> 16:33.721
<i>And I had promised to be brave.</i>

16:44.937 --> 16:46.598
Hey, come here!

16:47.973 --> 16:51.170
- What did the cow die of?
- We don't have enough water.

16:51.610 --> 16:53.578
Shit! It's always the same!

16:54.880 --> 16:56.780
You have to dig a well!

16:57.082 --> 16:58.276
A well!

17:14.767 --> 17:17.031
There's a car!

17:27.479 --> 17:28.673
Where?

17:29.681 --> 17:30.875
Over there!

18:07.586 --> 18:09.315
Everything's all right now.

18:09.388 --> 18:10.650
My dearest.

18:20.466 --> 18:21.694
Welcome.

18:22.534 --> 18:24.502
Welcome, little memsaab.

18:24.670 --> 18:26.001
Come here.

18:32.478 --> 18:34.207
Welcome to Rongai!

18:49.828 --> 18:52.092
Regina, my girl! Come here!

18:52.297 --> 18:56.256
Papa! We traveled by ship,
and we were in England and Morocco...

18:56.335 --> 18:57.962
and all over the harbor.

18:58.036 --> 19:01.563
I saw dolphins, and Mama danced.

19:37.009 --> 19:39.068
Bwana, he means water.

19:53.258 --> 19:54.987
Tell the man what to do.

19:55.060 --> 19:56.425
Yes, bwana.

20:43.709 --> 20:47.975
Your father took care of the paperwork,
the refugee tax and everything.

20:48.046 --> 20:52.278
We were lucky. In Hamburg they only
opened one chest full of clothes.

20:52.484 --> 20:54.247
Max gave me "Magic Mountain" for you.

20:54.319 --> 20:57.482
Thank goodness
the books were in the other chest.

20:58.690 --> 21:00.317
I'm sorry, Jettel.

21:00.759 --> 21:03.455
I know this isn't what you were expecting.

21:04.429 --> 21:05.828
It's lovely.

21:08.567 --> 21:10.467
But we can't live here.

21:25.517 --> 21:28.975
Not that one!
Don't unpack the patterned china.

21:29.054 --> 21:31.181
We won't be staying here long.

21:51.076 --> 21:53.772
Learn German if you want to talk to me.

21:54.813 --> 21:55.973
Plate.

22:03.021 --> 22:04.648
Careful!

22:40.692 --> 22:43.183
Jettel, my name is Süsskind.

22:44.429 --> 22:45.828
Also Walter.

22:46.732 --> 22:49.428
- But everyone calls me Süsskind.
- I see.

22:50.802 --> 22:54.533
Walter is showing Regina the farm.
They'll be back soon.

22:57.609 --> 23:00.772
- Like to have dinner with us?
- Very kind of you. Yes.

23:01.046 --> 23:03.606
I just spent four hours
driving through the desert.

23:04.049 --> 23:07.075
You'll probably have to
put up with me for the night.

23:10.122 --> 23:12.716
I brought you some onions and sugar.

23:14.526 --> 23:16.050
And cigarettes.

23:39.217 --> 23:40.548
Thank you.

23:54.800 --> 23:56.131
Thank you.

23:58.537 --> 24:00.266
Blessed Sabbath.

24:01.239 --> 24:03.434
I haven't heard the Kiddush for ages.

24:03.742 --> 24:06.438
Up to now I've never felt I needed God.

24:06.678 --> 24:09.238
If you take quinine every day,
you'll go blind.

24:09.314 --> 24:10.941
What about malaria?

24:11.016 --> 24:14.042
You can always combat it
if you catch it in time.

24:15.554 --> 24:19.217
Here's to the arrival of Jettel and Regina.

24:19.591 --> 24:21.024
To our second life.

24:22.093 --> 24:23.287
Cheers.

24:28.900 --> 24:30.868
How long have you been away from home?

24:30.936 --> 24:32.267
This is my home.

24:32.337 --> 24:35.397
Süsskind was smart enough
to leave Germany in '33.

24:35.474 --> 24:37.499
It was easier to leave back then.

24:38.009 --> 24:40.500
They let you take all your money, right?

24:42.247 --> 24:45.080
- And all your books.
- What about your wife?

24:45.484 --> 24:47.475
Weren't you ever married?

24:48.587 --> 24:50.054
No, I wasn't.

24:51.223 --> 24:52.850
- Why not?
- Jettel!

24:54.559 --> 24:59.019
It was always my bad luck to fall
in love with women who were already taken.

25:03.568 --> 25:06.833
My mother says
someone will have to stop the Nazis.

25:07.205 --> 25:11.039
Germany is rich in culture,
the home of Goethe and Schiller.

25:12.644 --> 25:15.078
Papa, I think I heard some lions.

25:15.480 --> 25:19.644
Nonsense. There aren't any lions around
here. Those are monkeys, baboons.

25:19.751 --> 25:23.619
Maybe the lion is just acting like a monkey.

25:23.822 --> 25:26.017
You have a great future here.

25:26.191 --> 25:28.716
You're already talking like a Negro.

25:35.967 --> 25:38.663
"The air is cool and darkling

25:39.137 --> 25:41.105
"And peaceful flows the Rhine

25:42.040 --> 25:45.635
"The mountain top is sparkling
The setting sunbeams shine

25:45.710 --> 25:49.168
"The fairest maid is reclining
in wondrous beauty there

25:49.548 --> 25:51.573
"Her golden jewels are shining

25:51.683 --> 25:53.708
"She combs her golden hair

25:54.719 --> 25:58.246
"With a golden comb she is combing,
and sings a song so free

25:58.323 --> 26:01.588
"It casts a spell on the gloaming,
a magical melody

26:04.396 --> 26:07.490
"The boatman listens, and o'er him
wild-aching passions roll

26:07.566 --> 26:11.366
"He sees but the maiden before him
He sees not reef or shoal

26:12.804 --> 26:16.865
"I think, at last the wave swallows
the boat and the boatman's cry

26:17.375 --> 26:19.775
"And this is the fate that follows

26:19.978 --> 26:22.071
"The song of the Lorelei"

26:22.314 --> 26:24.179
Sleep tight, my angel.

26:52.544 --> 26:55.138
You didn't bring the fridge, did you?

26:59.718 --> 27:01.015
No, I didn't.

27:01.086 --> 27:02.314
Why not?

27:03.588 --> 27:05.556
There was no room in the chests...

27:05.624 --> 27:07.990
But enough room
for your floral-patterned china?

27:08.126 --> 27:11.755
- There wasn't enough money, anyway.
- What did you do with the money?

27:13.665 --> 27:15.895
If you really want to know...

27:16.901 --> 27:19.836
I bought this at Wertheim's in Breslau.

27:19.904 --> 27:22.168
It cost 45 marks and is beautiful.

27:25.910 --> 27:28.003
You bought an evening gown.

27:29.681 --> 27:30.739
Yes.

27:43.228 --> 27:44.991
<i>... that he gives...</i>

27:46.931 --> 27:48.455
<i>his name to...</i>

27:49.567 --> 27:54.129
<i>... and leaves the mark of his personality...</i>

27:54.939 --> 27:56.736
<i>indelibly on his time...</i>

27:57.676 --> 28:00.110
I never thought I'd be happy
to hear his voice.

28:00.178 --> 28:03.614
I'll leave it here so you can stay in touch
with the outer world.

28:03.682 --> 28:04.706
And you?

28:04.816 --> 28:07.307
- Goodbye.
- We can't accept it.

28:07.786 --> 28:10.414
Of course you can. I have another one.

28:11.923 --> 28:16.121
Anyway, it'll give me a reason
to stop by now and then...

28:17.696 --> 28:19.357
to charge the battery.

28:19.431 --> 28:20.989
Do you have to go now?

28:22.734 --> 28:26.966
In this country we should forget
formalities and use the personal "you."

28:27.072 --> 28:28.835
Don't you think so?

28:33.344 --> 28:35.869
- Do you have a gun in the house?
- Yes, why?

28:35.947 --> 28:39.576
- Since Jettel and Regina are here.
- Morrison left me one.

28:40.685 --> 28:42.846
Good luck with the well.

29:03.374 --> 29:05.342
Come on, little memsaab!

29:06.945 --> 29:08.572
You see that mountain?

29:08.713 --> 29:10.442
That's Mount Kenya.

29:10.915 --> 29:12.246
It's holy.

29:13.551 --> 29:15.644
Mount Kenya.

29:17.589 --> 29:19.989
Come with me, little memsaab.

29:21.860 --> 29:25.660
Mama said I wasn't allowed
to go any further than this ridge.

29:57.195 --> 29:58.787
Can you help me?

29:59.764 --> 30:01.959
- Memsaab?
- Help me!

30:03.134 --> 30:05.932
I'm a cook. Cooks don't dig in the ground.

30:10.208 --> 30:12.073
The ground is thirsty.

30:13.044 --> 30:15.035
You need more water.

30:16.214 --> 30:17.704
Come with me!

30:18.850 --> 30:20.010
Water.

30:43.641 --> 30:44.938
No men?

30:45.176 --> 30:48.373
No, men don't carry water.

30:48.446 --> 30:50.437
That's women's work.

31:06.598 --> 31:08.998
Help me! It's so heavy!

31:24.749 --> 31:27.775
Owuor, help me, please!

31:28.887 --> 31:31.048
The water is so heavy.

31:31.623 --> 31:33.250
Help us, too!

31:51.910 --> 31:54.105
Please, give me the shovel!

32:13.431 --> 32:14.523
Fire.

32:17.201 --> 32:19.032
Yes, fire.

32:22.907 --> 32:24.898
There's no water in this ground here.

32:24.976 --> 32:27.206
- I told you so.
- You were right, Cepoi.

32:29.447 --> 32:30.880
I'm sorry.

32:33.184 --> 32:36.745
Go home!
And thank you. Thank you very much.

32:49.867 --> 32:51.391
6 months later.

32:51.970 --> 32:55.303
Why doesn't Owuor ever slaughter
a chicken? Nobody would notice.

32:55.573 --> 32:58.474
- Regina, put the doll down.
- We aren't allowed to eat them.

32:58.543 --> 33:01.637
It's our agreement with Morrison.
Only the eggs.

33:02.780 --> 33:05.715
I can't stand this muck anymore!
I need meat!

33:06.317 --> 33:07.944
Thank you, Owuor.

33:12.357 --> 33:13.619
Fire!

33:22.300 --> 33:24.325
You have to look at a fire...

33:24.402 --> 33:26.632
when it has slept for a long time.

33:29.807 --> 33:30.967
Don't worry, Jettel.

33:31.042 --> 33:34.478
It's just a common bushfire.
It won't reach the house.

33:53.297 --> 33:54.559
Where are you going?

33:54.632 --> 33:57.829
- To pack! I'm leaving!
- Nonsense!

33:58.102 --> 34:00.570
- I can't stand it here any longer!
- You have to.

34:00.638 --> 34:02.128
You always say that!

34:02.206 --> 34:05.972
But I want to go home to Mother
and Käthe, to people I understand.

34:06.077 --> 34:09.376
You don't earn a thing.
All we eat are eggs and cornmeal.

34:09.480 --> 34:13.678
How can we ever send Regina to school?
She can't always hang around with Owuor!

34:13.751 --> 34:16.413
- Damn it! We're alive!
- Yes, we're alive!

34:17.321 --> 34:18.879
But what for?

34:20.257 --> 34:24.217
To hope for rain,
so these cows that aren't ours don't die?

34:24.695 --> 34:27.630
My God, I feel like I'm dead,
and sometimes I wish I were!

34:28.099 --> 34:31.899
Don't ever say that again!
We just got out in the nick of time.

34:32.335 --> 34:34.360
What are you talking about?

34:36.306 --> 34:40.766
Last night the Nazis in Germany burned
down synagogues and looted Jewish shops.

34:42.080 --> 34:44.378
They smashed everything to pieces.

34:44.449 --> 34:47.418
People, buildings, stores, everything.

34:49.520 --> 34:52.114
How did you find out
on this goddamn farm?

34:52.422 --> 34:55.152
From a Swiss radio station this morning.

35:02.834 --> 35:05.428
The Nazis no longer see us as humans.

35:06.003 --> 35:09.302
Damn it. I saw it coming.

35:10.074 --> 35:12.201
I saw it from the beginning.

35:13.111 --> 35:17.241
Don't you realize that it doesn't matter
when and if Regina learns to read?

35:20.818 --> 35:23.810
What about Mama, Käthe...

35:24.255 --> 35:26.416
- your father?
- I have no idea!

35:26.757 --> 35:29.624
I kept telling them they had to leave!

35:47.411 --> 35:49.971
<i>10 November 1938.</i>

35:50.381 --> 35:51.746
<i>Dear Father:</i>

35:52.250 --> 35:56.186
<i>I am very upset about the news</i>
<i>I hear from Germany.</i>

35:56.754 --> 35:59.222
<i>People fear that war is inevitable.</i>

35:59.790 --> 36:01.451
<i>What do you think?</i>

36:02.894 --> 36:05.294
<i>If I only knew how you are doing.</i>

36:05.830 --> 36:08.822
<i>If I earned some money,</i>
<i>I'd have you come here.</i>

36:09.133 --> 36:12.227
<i>Don't you see any opportunity</i>
<i>to leave Germany?</i>

36:12.870 --> 36:14.337
<i>I beg you...</i>

36:15.540 --> 36:16.871
<i>Father...</i>

36:17.108 --> 36:19.804
<i>How I long for a conversation with you...</i>

36:20.344 --> 36:22.710
<i>for your advice, your sympathy.</i>

36:28.152 --> 36:32.714
<i>Being abroad, I have become aware how</i>
<i>blessed I am to have parents like you...</i>

36:32.857 --> 36:36.349
<i>and how grateful I am for everything</i>
<i>you did for me.</i>

36:36.627 --> 36:41.360
<i>Your money wasn't wasted by allowing me</i>
<i>to study so long after mother's death.</i>

36:41.732 --> 36:46.101
<i>One day your son will certainly be</i>
<i>the lawyer you were always so proud of.</i>

37:05.756 --> 37:07.781
Come here, little memsaab.

37:22.506 --> 37:26.636
It needs you. It is a child like you.

37:53.304 --> 37:56.967
- It's so cold!
- Do you want to run around like a Negro?

37:57.041 --> 37:58.099
I don't care.

37:58.175 --> 38:02.612
I don't have anything against Negroes,
and there aren't any other kids here...

38:02.680 --> 38:04.705
but be careful.

38:04.782 --> 38:07.080
They have illnesses like malaria and so on.

38:07.485 --> 38:11.080
They are very dirty,
and I don't want you to get sick.

38:11.222 --> 38:13.713
A white child is not a black child.

38:14.592 --> 38:17.618
And promise you don't eat anything
they give you.

38:17.695 --> 38:19.822
And never enter their huts.

38:21.032 --> 38:22.192
So...

38:24.001 --> 38:25.628
Now swallow this.

38:26.971 --> 38:30.338
It's too bitter.
And anyway, it'll make me go blind.

38:30.408 --> 38:32.308
Nonsense. Open your mouth.

38:35.913 --> 38:37.380
Hey, Mama.

38:38.149 --> 38:42.984
There's a ceremony tonight. They'll
slaughter a lamb and ask Ngai for rain.

38:43.054 --> 38:46.251
- Ask whom?
- Ngai, their god who lives on the mountain...

38:46.324 --> 38:48.758
Mount Kenya, and the fig tree, too.

38:49.293 --> 38:51.727
They're asking him for rain.
It's a big ceremony.

38:51.796 --> 38:53.559
You're not going.

38:53.631 --> 38:55.963
They're asking Ngai for rain.

38:56.033 --> 38:58.729
Could you tell me
why you always repeat everything?

38:58.803 --> 39:00.293
Do the Negroes do that, too?

39:00.371 --> 39:02.168
You can't repeat good things enough.

39:02.239 --> 39:04.036
- Who says?
- Everyone.

39:04.108 --> 39:06.474
- Everyone?
- You can't repeat good things enough.

39:06.544 --> 39:09.274
My God, Regina!
What should I do with you?

39:10.681 --> 39:12.979
- Remember Grandma?
- What?

39:13.050 --> 39:14.677
She always said:

39:14.752 --> 39:18.244
"Don't worry about Regina.
She has the luck of a Gentile."

39:21.392 --> 39:22.723
Exactly...

39:23.728 --> 39:25.195
the luck of a Gentile.

39:25.396 --> 39:27.387
That's what Grandma always said.

39:27.465 --> 39:30.457
So you don't have to worry, Mama.

39:30.634 --> 39:33.102
My angel. I'm so afraid
something might happen to you.

39:33.170 --> 39:36.037
Don't worry. It's nice here.

39:37.942 --> 39:39.671
Toto! Toto!

41:28.819 --> 41:31.686
Memsaab!
Bwana has gone out with the big gun!

41:57.214 --> 41:58.442
Kill it.

42:03.521 --> 42:06.354
I can't do it! You see that I can't!

42:09.760 --> 42:12.456
I just wanted you to have your damn meat!

42:23.941 --> 42:25.932
They don't want anything?

42:26.577 --> 42:29.740
No. They said they're not hungry.

42:46.030 --> 42:48.897
Good night.
I don't mind if you go on reading.

42:48.966 --> 42:50.729
I've read this book 3 times!

42:51.035 --> 42:53.833
Who cares if I read it a fourth time!

42:54.171 --> 42:55.502
Regina.

42:58.576 --> 43:03.036
I didn't expect you to be able to hunt.
I couldn't have done it either.

43:03.113 --> 43:05.013
You never killed an animal before.

43:05.082 --> 43:09.348
But I want to! I'm warning you,
don't treat me like a loser!

43:09.420 --> 43:12.184
Did I? I didn't ask you to go hunting!

43:13.257 --> 43:15.487
You act like I'm a leper!

43:15.659 --> 43:17.126
You've changed.

43:17.294 --> 43:21.993
The hell I have! Truth is, you only let
me under your skirt when I'm a lawyer!

43:22.399 --> 43:25.493
I got no chance in the desert,
unshaved and sweaty.

43:25.569 --> 43:28.470
- Watch your tongue!
- I'm your husband!

43:28.539 --> 43:31.770
I can tell you what I think,
even if you don't like it!

43:31.942 --> 43:34.638
You have no right to a privileged life!

43:38.248 --> 43:40.580
We've just been lucky up to now.

43:41.118 --> 43:44.884
Stop playing the spoiled daughter,
and wake up to what's going on here!

43:45.689 --> 43:46.986
Where are you going?

43:47.825 --> 43:49.087
To the bar.

43:49.627 --> 43:52.892
But now that we've brought it up,
the way you treat Owuor...

43:52.963 --> 43:55.022
reminds me of some people in Germany...

43:55.099 --> 43:57.499
to whom you certainly
don't want to be compared!

44:32.836 --> 44:34.098
It's nice and warm.

44:34.672 --> 44:36.435
Yeah, nice and warm.

44:44.815 --> 44:47.682
Hey, little dog. Where did you come from?

44:52.056 --> 44:55.583
- Cepoi, whose dog is this?
- This dog has no home.

44:55.726 --> 44:58.456
It's a wild dog. It comes from the huts.

45:00.497 --> 45:04.593
Daddy, this dog has no home.
Can I keep him, please?

45:04.702 --> 45:07.500
- But you're afraid of dogs.
- No, not here.

45:08.305 --> 45:11.763
Yes, I like him. We'll keep him.

45:13.110 --> 45:16.546
We'll call him Rummler,
like the Nazi chairman in Leobschütz.

45:16.780 --> 45:19.146
- Rummler is a nice name.
- Exactly.

45:19.583 --> 45:21.915
Every day we can say,
"Rummler, you bastard"...

45:21.985 --> 45:24.010
and nobody will arrest us.

46:26.450 --> 46:28.941
The trucks! They're driving fast!

46:40.564 --> 46:41.826
Süsskind!

46:42.933 --> 46:46.164
- What does it mean?
- Don't you listen to the radio?

46:46.236 --> 46:48.966
War has broken out. We're being interned.

46:49.139 --> 46:51.801
You don't think I'll leave Jettel
and Regina here!

46:51.875 --> 46:52.864
Don't worry.

46:53.010 --> 46:57.310
The British are reliable.
They're taking us to Nairobi.

46:57.381 --> 47:01.215
- Tell me I have nothing to fear.
- You have my word of honor.

47:04.321 --> 47:06.084
I'm not going away!

47:12.362 --> 47:14.262
Owuor! Take care of the two!

47:14.498 --> 47:16.022
Yes, bwana. I will.

47:38.188 --> 47:39.849
May I take this, too?

47:40.257 --> 47:42.987
No, only one thing.
Either the bear or the doll.

47:53.904 --> 47:55.895
Don't forget your passport.

47:55.973 --> 47:57.907
- You speak German?
- Yes.

47:59.476 --> 48:01.239
My mother is German.

48:04.214 --> 48:06.205
Don't cry, little memsaab!

48:06.550 --> 48:09.781
I'll find you everywhere, and follow you.

48:10.888 --> 48:11.877
Promise?

48:11.955 --> 48:15.584
Promise. I'll catch a new Toto for you.

48:15.926 --> 48:18.053
No, I don't want a new Toto.

48:19.563 --> 48:23.556
I didn't protect him very well.
His mother should have looked after him.

48:23.867 --> 48:27.064
I'm not a good mother for an antelope baby.

48:28.205 --> 48:30.571
You're wise, little memsaab.

48:33.644 --> 48:35.635
Take care of our things!

48:35.812 --> 48:38.508
Goodbye, Owuor! Goodbye, Rummler!

49:08.478 --> 49:12.141
<i>Suddenly, we were no longer refugees,</i>
<i>but enemy aliens.</i>

49:12.215 --> 49:15.946
<i>We really didn't know why</i>
<i>the British wanted to lock us up.</i>

49:16.019 --> 49:19.011
<i>We were Germans,</i>
<i>and England and Germany were at war...</i>

49:19.089 --> 49:22.650
<i>but, after all, we were Jews</i>
<i>who certainly didn't side with Hitler.</i>

50:29.926 --> 50:32.190
What a nice prison, Mama.

51:03.693 --> 51:06.093
- Do you understand all this?
- No.

51:08.198 --> 51:10.962
They probably didn't know where to put us.

51:13.737 --> 51:16.570
- I bet that's a plum pudding.
- What's that?

51:16.740 --> 51:18.708
Something English.

51:43.400 --> 51:45.698
This reminds me of better times.

51:45.769 --> 51:50.035
- In the end we'll have to pay for this.
- The chef worked on a luxury liner.

51:50.474 --> 51:52.999
- He can't help it.
- I'm really hungry!

51:56.113 --> 51:57.205
No, thanks.

51:58.315 --> 51:59.441
No, thanks.

52:07.224 --> 52:11.661
In Breslau, we were always going
to dinner parties and receptions.

52:14.464 --> 52:17.456
I tell you, it was such a nice life.

52:18.301 --> 52:21.168
Before emigration every jerk was a prince.

52:25.075 --> 52:27.270
Are you finished? Thank you.

52:43.894 --> 52:45.794
No message for your husband?

52:51.801 --> 52:53.632
<i>It's the feeling of being alone...</i>

52:54.070 --> 52:56.903
of knowing
that you really have nothing to say...

52:57.307 --> 53:01.641
nothing to share but the time you spend
together, and a child maybe.

53:02.612 --> 53:05.775
It's a painful realization.
You know what I mean?

53:06.583 --> 53:07.948
Oh, well.

53:08.285 --> 53:11.277
Being alone is one thing.
I know all about it.

53:12.255 --> 53:14.746
But with a woman like Jettel...

53:15.358 --> 53:17.189
such a beautiful woman...

53:18.061 --> 53:20.052
So cheerful and full of life.

53:21.531 --> 53:24.329
Maybe you aren't giving her a real chance.

53:25.535 --> 53:29.938
Back in Leobschütz everything was fine.
We both played our parts.

53:31.174 --> 53:32.402
You see.

53:33.777 --> 53:35.768
She won't accept reality.

53:37.147 --> 53:39.672
I want a mature woman I can talk to.

53:42.252 --> 53:45.449
I have to cope with everything, too.
My father, Liesl...

53:46.456 --> 53:48.083
Will you shut up!

54:01.871 --> 54:04.931
Sometimes I think we're like two packages.

54:07.077 --> 54:09.773
All tied up, lying in a train...

54:11.281 --> 54:14.011
which is taking us to an unknown address.

54:14.951 --> 54:19.149
We travel a long way together,
but we don't really know what's inside.

54:20.457 --> 54:22.186
You worry too much.

54:23.526 --> 54:25.687
Perhaps. Sleep well.

54:41.378 --> 54:44.814
<i>After a few weeks,</i>
<i>the hotel wanted to get rid of us.</i>

54:45.482 --> 54:49.578
<i>Every day we wandered with our mothers</i>
<i>from one shady spot to the next...</i>

54:49.653 --> 54:51.917
<i>wondering about</i>
<i>what we were having for dinner.</i>

54:51.988 --> 54:55.754
If only we could go out for a walk.
I'm going crazy in here.

54:56.726 --> 55:00.093
If my husband were interned,
I'd fight to have him released...

55:00.163 --> 55:02.529
instead of sitting here complaining.

55:02.599 --> 55:05.363
- But how?
- Mama, I'm hungry!

55:05.535 --> 55:08.470
- Hey, you greedy little pig.
- You're all Jews.

55:08.672 --> 55:12.506
Why don't you write a letter
to your community in Nairobi?

55:12.609 --> 55:15.100
Jews here have influence, don't they?

55:15.512 --> 55:16.979
That'd be the first time.

55:17.280 --> 55:19.077
Can anyone speak English?

55:19.249 --> 55:20.375
I can.

55:21.518 --> 55:24.783
<i>The Jewish community had no problem</i>
<i>convincing the British...</i>

55:24.854 --> 55:27.789
<i>that not every German sided with Hitler.</i>

55:28.091 --> 55:31.720
<i>Two weeks later, we were allowed</i>
<i>to visit the men at the internment camp.</i>

55:32.062 --> 55:35.190
<i>Wearing khakis, it was nearly impossible</i>
<i>to distinguish...</i>

55:35.398 --> 55:38.128
<i>between our imprisoned fathers</i>
<i>and the British soldiers.</i>

55:53.016 --> 55:56.281
Papa, I have a girlfriend, a real girlfriend!

55:56.353 --> 55:58.844
Her name is Inge. And she can read.

55:58.922 --> 56:00.890
And Mama wrote a letter.

56:01.024 --> 56:02.423
A letter?

56:02.492 --> 56:05.120
So we could visit you.

56:17.841 --> 56:21.538
- You wrote a letter to the British?
- Not just me. All the women.

56:21.978 --> 56:25.004
- Maybe we can return to Rongai soon?
- What's changed your mind?

56:25.081 --> 56:28.778
You were desperately unhappy there.
Like something to drink?

56:30.220 --> 56:33.383
- They all want to go back to their farms.
- I see.

56:42.732 --> 56:45.132
- We can't return to Rongai.
- What?

56:45.535 --> 56:48.129
Morrison fired me because of the war.

56:48.538 --> 56:50.836
He doesn't want an enemy alien on his farm.

56:50.907 --> 56:52.499
What does that mean?

56:52.642 --> 56:55.770
I'm out of work, and we have no home.

57:05.021 --> 57:08.149
We'll have to pick up our things at the farm.

57:08.992 --> 57:11.620
Maybe he's still waiting for us...

57:11.694 --> 57:14.254
because he thinks that we're coming back.

57:14.330 --> 57:16.059
Maybe Papa will see Owuor.

57:16.666 --> 57:19.567
- And he'll bring him here.
- Of course.

57:20.703 --> 57:22.068
Of course.

58:01.644 --> 58:03.635
Could I be of assistance?

58:03.880 --> 58:06.906
Yes, please. I need a "special permission."

58:07.183 --> 58:11.415
I have to leave the premises for a few
hours to meet Mr. Edward Rubens...

58:11.488 --> 58:14.821
the head of the Jewish community
in Nairobi. It's urgent.

58:24.934 --> 58:27.494
My husband and I were in Berlin...

58:27.570 --> 58:30.664
in '36 for the Olympics.

58:30.907 --> 58:34.638
That was our last time in Germany.
My God, we were naive!

58:34.744 --> 58:38.578
It was no different with us.
We believed to the bitter end...

58:38.915 --> 58:41.941
No, thanks.
That our civilized friends would stop Hitler.

58:42.118 --> 58:43.107
Friends?

58:44.254 --> 58:46.415
The Germans were never friends
to the Jews.

58:46.489 --> 58:47.581
I don't agree.

58:47.957 --> 58:50.721
Where are your "friends" now? And in '38?

58:50.827 --> 58:54.695
- Without Hitler...
- Hitler didn't invent anti-Semitism.

59:00.236 --> 59:01.828
How can we be of assistance?

59:02.272 --> 59:04.866
Mr. Morrison, the owner of our farm...

59:04.941 --> 59:07.171
won't employ any enemy aliens.

59:07.443 --> 59:10.276
But without work,
Walter can't leave the camp...

59:10.380 --> 59:12.780
and we don't know
where to find a job for him.

59:13.149 --> 59:15.379
So, I ask you to help us again.

59:15.652 --> 59:17.779
We'd do everything to be good farmers.

59:18.755 --> 59:20.689
And that's why you've come to me?

59:20.757 --> 59:24.955
You think you're the only people
to suffer from this stupid war?

59:25.495 --> 59:29.659
You think we're responsible for you,
because we let you enter this country?

59:29.766 --> 59:33.395
You're alive! You're here!
My God! Make something out of it!

59:42.745 --> 59:45.441
We have relatives in Europe, in Poland.

59:46.115 --> 59:49.050
My husband hasn't heard from them
for months.

59:49.485 --> 59:51.214
Sorry to hear that.

59:56.826 --> 59:59.659
- Thank you. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

01:00:43.272 --> 01:00:44.762
What are you doing here?

01:00:45.308 --> 01:00:47.469
Was your little outing successful?

01:00:55.551 --> 01:00:57.348
What do you mean?

01:01:01.257 --> 01:01:04.658
You're looking for a job
on a farm for your husband?

01:01:06.062 --> 01:01:09.293
I have a friend here in the army.

01:01:10.466 --> 01:01:11.797
He needs someone.

01:01:15.271 --> 01:01:17.034
I could talk to him.

01:01:22.145 --> 01:01:24.443
That would be very nice of you.

01:01:52.175 --> 01:01:54.439
- Come on.
- I tagged you!

01:01:55.278 --> 01:01:56.677
Catch me!

01:02:06.222 --> 01:02:09.783
Where have you been? A letter for you.

01:02:10.593 --> 01:02:12.390
It looks quite important.

01:02:16.666 --> 01:02:18.759
Darn it! How do you say "morgen?"

01:02:18.835 --> 01:02:21.303
My gosh, Jettel! It's "tomorrow!"

01:02:22.605 --> 01:02:24.266
Try to remember that!

01:02:27.076 --> 01:02:29.101
You see? You got it!

01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:39.185
Oh, Regina!

01:02:40.823 --> 01:02:42.188
Walter!

01:02:43.059 --> 01:02:44.924
- How did you manage it?
- What?

01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:05.709
Here we are, Owuor!

01:03:21.030 --> 01:03:24.124
The holy mountain
looks like a Chinaman's hat.

01:03:24.433 --> 01:03:27.425
Get down from there!
You're going to break your neck!

01:03:27.970 --> 01:03:31.303
This is the most beautiful place
in the whole world!

01:03:35.745 --> 01:03:37.076
Thank you.

01:03:40.516 --> 01:03:42.211
Süsskind, I'm afraid.

01:03:42.285 --> 01:03:43.650
Afraid of what?

01:03:43.786 --> 01:03:46.755
This place is further away
from your farm than Rongai.

01:03:46.823 --> 01:03:49.314
You can hardly ever visit us.

01:03:49.392 --> 01:03:51.519
I'd drive 20 miles more to see you.

01:03:51.627 --> 01:03:52.855
Promise?

01:03:53.963 --> 01:03:56.431
I'll be here more often than you like.

01:04:12.748 --> 01:04:15.740
At least we've gotten rid
of those damn cattle.

01:04:19.388 --> 01:04:21.356
Are you doing all right?

01:04:23.993 --> 01:04:27.429
- I'm your bwana, and I order you...
- Well, bwana?

01:04:27.496 --> 01:04:30.863
...to take off your blouse.
- Are you meshuga, or what?

01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:33.994
If you do you'll get a fried chicken.

01:04:41.577 --> 01:04:45.377
And now you have to walk down the path
like an African woman.

01:05:02.431 --> 01:05:05.195
Hey! Did you miss me in your hotel?

01:05:05.635 --> 01:05:07.500
Ouch! What are you doing?

01:05:38.534 --> 01:05:39.967
Good morning.

01:05:44.974 --> 01:05:47.738
My name is Walter Redlich.

01:05:50.112 --> 01:05:52.046
I'm the new bwana here.

01:05:55.818 --> 01:05:57.410
You'll need my help.

01:05:57.486 --> 01:06:01.047
- I've lived here for 40 years.
- I'd appreciate your help.

01:06:10.333 --> 01:06:13.427
- Is Bwana Gibson dead?
- No.

01:06:13.903 --> 01:06:17.236
Bwana Gibson can't be here.
He's serving in the Royal Army.

01:06:17.306 --> 01:06:19.433
He asked me to run his farm.

01:06:19.842 --> 01:06:21.434
Show me what to do.

01:06:21.978 --> 01:06:23.673
You aren't a British bwana?

01:06:23.746 --> 01:06:27.011
No, I didn't come here to get rich.

01:06:27.083 --> 01:06:30.246
I came here because I was chased
out of my own country.

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:33.811
- What country are you from?
- Germany.

01:06:33.889 --> 01:06:36.551
It is far away from here. It is at war.

01:06:40.463 --> 01:06:43.330
If someone steals your cow...

01:06:43.399 --> 01:06:45.890
it will be killed and eaten.

01:06:46.235 --> 01:06:48.760
And you can forget it.

01:06:49.138 --> 01:06:52.596
But if someone steals your land,
it is always there.

01:06:52.942 --> 01:06:56.173
You can visit it. It will always be there.

01:06:56.645 --> 01:06:58.670
You can never forget it.

01:07:36.152 --> 01:07:38.746
Daji Jiwan is Indian. He's a good Fundi.

01:07:39.188 --> 01:07:41.247
He can help you build the house.

01:07:42.625 --> 01:07:44.855
When you work for me you will get maize...

01:07:44.927 --> 01:07:48.158
firewood, 2 liters of milk a day
and 12 shillings a month.

01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:50.391
12 shillings aren't much.

01:07:50.833 --> 01:07:54.701
I don't bargain. If you don't want
to work, someone else will, Daji.

01:08:00.509 --> 01:08:04.138
- These men can't build a house for you.
- I'll teach them.

01:08:18.894 --> 01:08:22.158
Bwana, Kania is my brother.
He can sweep the floors.

01:08:22.231 --> 01:08:25.723
Can Kania cook, too? We need a cook.

01:08:25.868 --> 01:08:30.395
No, Kania isn't a cook.
Kania can sweep the floors.

01:08:32.341 --> 01:08:34.604
Kamau can cook for the dog.

01:08:34.844 --> 01:08:37.038
For what dog? We don't have a dog.

01:08:43.252 --> 01:08:45.685
Yes or no?

01:08:46.055 --> 01:08:47.716
It's very expensive!

01:08:50.326 --> 01:08:52.294
I've come for the mail.

01:09:13.115 --> 01:09:16.175
Letters with this stamp always bring tears.

01:09:16.252 --> 01:09:18.082
I will give it to bwana.

01:09:18.487 --> 01:09:20.955
That's good. You are his friend.

01:09:27.662 --> 01:09:30.631
<i>Sohrau, 2 October 1940.</i>

01:09:30.933 --> 01:09:32.332
<i>My dear son:</i>

01:09:33.102 --> 01:09:37.265
<i>It's wonderful to hear about</i>
<i>your good fortune with the second farm.</i>

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:40.331
<i>For us it's impossible to emigrate now.</i>

01:09:40.809 --> 01:09:43.538
<i>Hitler will be closing the borders soon.</i>

01:09:44.279 --> 01:09:47.545
<i>Anyway, we have nothing left</i>
<i>that we could sell for cash.</i>

01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:51.411
<i>They say that the Jews</i>
<i>are going to be taken to ghettos.</i>

01:09:51.554 --> 01:09:56.218
<i>If that happens, I'll have Grescheck</i>
<i>send you our new address immediately.</i>

01:09:57.826 --> 01:10:01.728
<i>Walter, I'm afraid</i>
<i>for the first time in my life.</i>

01:10:03.032 --> 01:10:04.363
<i>Afraid...</i>

01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:07.294
<i>for Liesl, but also for myself.</i>

01:10:10.906 --> 01:10:14.535
<i>We feel like our old Germany</i>
<i>is a desert island.</i>

01:10:14.910 --> 01:10:17.879
<i>Hardly anyone dares to talk to us.</i>

01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:19.870
<i>It is horrible.</i>

01:10:21.016 --> 01:10:22.210
<i>My son...</i>

01:10:22.518 --> 01:10:26.352
<i>I'm sending you some rose seeds</i>
<i>as you wanted.</i>

01:10:26.989 --> 01:10:30.117
<i>May these seeds</i>
<i>sprout in the African earth...</i>

01:10:30.626 --> 01:10:32.560
<i>and bring joy to Jettel, you...</i>

01:10:33.629 --> 01:10:35.893
<i>and my little Regina.</i>

01:10:36.865 --> 01:10:38.890
<i>My thoughts are always with you.</i>

01:10:38.968 --> 01:10:40.492
<i>Yours, Father.</i>

01:10:42.905 --> 01:10:44.998
They've taken a long journey.

01:10:45.207 --> 01:10:47.937
Yes, a long journey.

01:10:54.817 --> 01:10:57.650
I want us to register Regina at school soon.

01:10:57.886 --> 01:10:59.945
Five pounds a month, we can afford it.

01:11:00.022 --> 01:11:03.685
The next time Süsskind goes to Nakuru
he can ask about it.

01:11:18.841 --> 01:11:20.103
Rummler.

01:11:29.718 --> 01:11:30.844
Owuor?

01:11:36.125 --> 01:11:38.389
Have you learned to cook?

01:11:43.299 --> 01:11:44.891
You've found us!

01:11:45.267 --> 01:11:47.701
Memsaab doesn't have a cook
in Ol Joro Orok?

01:11:47.936 --> 01:11:49.631
No, we don't have a cook.

01:11:49.705 --> 01:11:52.105
How did you know?
And how did you find us?

01:11:52.174 --> 01:11:55.075
Rummler has a good nose.

01:12:03.319 --> 01:12:04.843
A bit of flour.

01:12:09.224 --> 01:12:10.555
Thank you!

01:12:12.528 --> 01:12:14.758
A little boy and a little girl...

01:12:15.197 --> 01:12:17.097
are lost in the forest.

01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:21.192
They are afraid.
The forest is dangerous at night.

01:12:21.770 --> 01:12:24.295
This is an angel. It lives in heaven.

01:12:24.673 --> 01:12:26.903
- And what's this?
- Those are his wings.

01:12:26.975 --> 01:12:28.875
He needs them to fly up to Heaven.

01:12:28.944 --> 01:12:30.673
Have you ever seen an angel?

01:12:30.746 --> 01:12:32.907
No. Angels are invisible.

01:12:33.048 --> 01:12:34.948
The ancestors are invisible, too.

01:12:35.017 --> 01:12:38.578
Yes. Angels protect us, too,
when we're in danger.

01:12:39.888 --> 01:12:43.153
I'm an angel,
and I'll drive away the evil spirits!

01:13:03.078 --> 01:13:04.409
Come here!

01:13:08.884 --> 01:13:09.942
No!

01:13:16.158 --> 01:13:17.557
Yummy, kids!

01:13:25.033 --> 01:13:26.193
Come to me!

01:13:27.403 --> 01:13:29.234
Go away! Go away!

01:13:47.823 --> 01:13:50.656
When you come back,
I won't be a child anymore.

01:13:50.726 --> 01:13:53.661
Nonsense.
I'll always come home for vacation.

01:13:53.762 --> 01:13:56.754
I'll be back for the next maize harvest.

01:14:10.446 --> 01:14:12.573
Swear that you'll come back.

01:14:15.417 --> 01:14:16.645
I swear.

01:14:42.744 --> 01:14:44.507
I think that's him.

01:15:00.195 --> 01:15:02.060
Learn all you can, angel.

01:15:04.533 --> 01:15:07.627
Mama, I'll be back for vacation.

01:15:07.703 --> 01:15:09.364
I know, my angel.

01:15:11.874 --> 01:15:15.037
When I come back,
I'll tell you all about it, Owuor.

01:15:49.778 --> 01:15:51.109
Come home!

01:16:31.386 --> 01:16:34.150
We're Jewish. We have to step out.

01:17:08.624 --> 01:17:11.320
<i>I learned very quickly</i>
<i>what it means to be an outsider.</i>

01:17:11.660 --> 01:17:14.356
<i>As Jews, we didn't have to pray...</i>

01:17:14.429 --> 01:17:16.954
<i>and we could eat what we liked on Fridays.</i>

01:17:17.132 --> 01:17:21.068
<i>Every once in a while a snake fell</i>
<i>on the playing field...</i>

01:17:21.269 --> 01:17:23.294
<i>the lost prey of a falcon.</i>

01:17:24.339 --> 01:17:26.307
<i>I was happy to have Inge.</i>

01:17:26.375 --> 01:17:28.309
<i>She didn't like sports either...</i>

01:17:28.377 --> 01:17:31.505
<i>at least not those stupid games</i>
<i>the British played.</i>

01:17:48.296 --> 01:17:51.322
<i>It's strange how some words</i>
<i>lose their meaning here.</i>

01:17:51.767 --> 01:17:54.736
<i>For example, "tax return" or "streetcar."</i>

01:17:58.006 --> 01:18:01.442
<i>Sometimes I wonder why</i>
<i>I even get dressed in the morning.</i>

01:18:01.610 --> 01:18:05.307
<i>I might as well wear a sack.</i>
<i>Nobody around here would care.</i>

01:18:05.414 --> 01:18:06.642
I would.

01:18:08.650 --> 01:18:10.675
Do you still find me attractive?

01:18:10.952 --> 01:18:12.920
You do have your great moments.

01:18:19.594 --> 01:18:21.994
<i>Did you get to know someone in Norfolk?</i>

01:18:22.664 --> 01:18:26.100
<i>Do you think people</i>
<i>should stay together for their entire life?</i>

01:18:26.635 --> 01:18:28.102
<i>I guess not.</i>

01:18:29.104 --> 01:18:33.404
<i>It's probably just some nonsense which</i>
<i>our ancestors persuaded us to adopt.</i>

01:18:36.378 --> 01:18:39.108
<i>If you had your choice, would you leave?</i>

01:18:41.717 --> 01:18:45.619
<i>I sometimes wonder if there could have</i>
<i>been a happier way of life for me.</i>

01:18:45.687 --> 01:18:47.245
<i>Do you understand?</i>

01:18:48.990 --> 01:18:51.720
If I'd decided differently at one time.

01:18:54.629 --> 01:18:58.622
Listen, I want to make it with you.
I want it to work for us.

01:18:58.700 --> 01:19:00.998
You're my wife and I love you!

01:19:05.107 --> 01:19:06.938
I miss them all so much...

01:19:08.143 --> 01:19:09.940
my mother, Käthe.

01:19:12.147 --> 01:19:13.774
It hurts so much!

01:23:26.301 --> 01:23:28.735
Well? Isn't that nice, Jogona?

01:23:28.803 --> 01:23:30.703
You can't talk to the night.

01:23:30.872 --> 01:23:33.670
You're right. You can't talk to the night.

01:23:37.545 --> 01:23:40.673
The poet imagined that the night had ears.

01:23:41.416 --> 01:23:44.010
It is lovely to make music with words.

01:23:45.787 --> 01:23:47.778
Your father is a wise man.

01:23:47.856 --> 01:23:50.120
He can talk to the thunder and lightning.

01:23:50.191 --> 01:23:53.092
He talks to the ancestors. That's different.

01:23:58.266 --> 01:24:01.565
You must take off your blouse,
or it will get dirty.

01:24:03.371 --> 01:24:05.134
I won't take off my blouse anymore.

01:24:05.206 --> 01:24:07.367
I'm no longer a little child.

01:24:07.609 --> 01:24:10.806
You're a stupid child
if you dirty your school blouse.

01:24:10.879 --> 01:24:14.679
I'm no longer a child.
You can't see my breasts anymore.

01:24:15.150 --> 01:24:18.381
They are no different than the breasts
of the women in the village.

01:24:19.287 --> 01:24:23.656
Yes, they are. The breasts of a Mzungus
are different. You can't see them.

01:24:23.725 --> 01:24:26.694
The Mzungus' schools
teach very strange things.

01:24:27.896 --> 01:24:31.093
Are Mzungus like you
still allowed to climb trees?

01:24:37.639 --> 01:24:41.769
Yes. But only when they don't
dirty their school uniform.

01:24:51.653 --> 01:24:53.120
Wait, Jogona!

01:25:31.693 --> 01:25:33.422
Be careful, Regina!

01:25:41.503 --> 01:25:44.165
<i>My dear loved ones, we are very nervous.</i>

01:25:45.006 --> 01:25:47.440
<i>We are being sent</i>
<i>to Poland tomorrow to work.</i>

01:25:48.042 --> 01:25:50.909
<i>Don't forget us. Mother and Käthe.</i>

01:25:51.679 --> 01:25:53.044
What does that mean?

01:25:54.382 --> 01:25:57.545
They weren't allowed to write more
than 20 words.

01:25:59.487 --> 01:26:01.216
They gave away one.

01:26:23.144 --> 01:26:26.841
They are bad days
when Memsaab Kidogo has to go to school.

01:26:27.749 --> 01:26:30.274
Maybe they want to leave via Poland.

01:26:36.090 --> 01:26:38.320
Maybe they've found a way out.

01:26:40.862 --> 01:26:44.662
Say something, Walter! Please! Talk to me!

01:26:48.736 --> 01:26:52.729
Your mother wanted you to know.
Or she wouldn't have written it.

01:26:54.909 --> 01:26:57.241
- Poland means death.
- No!

01:26:57.979 --> 01:27:02.143
You know what?
I envy you for getting this letter...

01:27:02.250 --> 01:27:05.947
for the certainty!
I have no idea how my father's doing...

01:27:08.523 --> 01:27:10.320
where he is...

01:27:10.558 --> 01:27:12.048
where my sister is.

01:27:22.704 --> 01:27:27.038
<i>Every day the German troops in the East</i>
<i>suffer a new defeat.</i>

01:27:27.742 --> 01:27:29.369
<i>German casualties are...</i>

01:27:29.444 --> 01:27:31.241
<i>no less significant.</i>

01:27:33.147 --> 01:27:36.446
<i>The number of Germans</i>
<i>who have died or been captured...</i>

01:27:36.551 --> 01:27:39.315
<i>since the beginning</i>
<i>of the Russian winter offensive...</i>

01:27:39.387 --> 01:27:42.254
<i>is now more than 400,000.</i>

01:27:59.173 --> 01:28:00.640
What are you doing?

01:28:00.908 --> 01:28:03.399
This woman needs no help.
She wants to die.

01:28:03.578 --> 01:28:05.978
And her family has left her here?

01:28:06.681 --> 01:28:09.115
The hyenas will take away her body
at night.

01:28:15.590 --> 01:28:18.218
Kimani, I can't allow this.

01:28:20.194 --> 01:28:24.062
I am the memsaab of this farm!
Carry the woman into the house!

01:28:24.198 --> 01:28:26.928
If she dies in the hut,
it will no longer be pure.

01:28:27.068 --> 01:28:30.299
It would be a great sacrifice
for the family to cleanse it.

01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:34.635
It would cost the family a lot of money.

01:28:34.909 --> 01:28:37.377
I don't care. It's an order!

01:28:37.845 --> 01:28:39.710
As soon as the memsaab is inside...

01:28:39.781 --> 01:28:43.217
she will be carried out again.
The woman wants to die outside.

01:28:43.518 --> 01:28:45.418
That is what the tradition requires.

01:28:45.987 --> 01:28:47.716
It's all right, memsaab.

01:28:47.989 --> 01:28:51.948
My mother won't die alone.
The ancestors are with her. She isn't afraid.

01:29:19.387 --> 01:29:22.254
If you like, you can be out of here soon.

01:29:23.224 --> 01:29:26.990
They call it "Operation J,"
the restructuring of troops in Kenya.

01:29:27.061 --> 01:29:29.052
They're really taking Germans?

01:29:29.530 --> 01:29:32.624
Jewish men your age stand a chance.

01:29:33.134 --> 01:29:36.103
Nobody will accuse them
of siding with Hitler.

01:29:36.170 --> 01:29:40.436
But don't be a fool and tell them
you're fed up with farm life...

01:29:40.508 --> 01:29:43.875
and you need a change.
They want to hear that you're for the Allies...

01:29:44.278 --> 01:29:46.769
and you're ready to fight for the right cause.

01:29:50.151 --> 01:29:53.552
- What about Jettel?
- She could live in Nairobi.

01:29:55.857 --> 01:29:59.452
I can hardly believe that I'll get
a chance to take part in this war.

01:30:01.095 --> 01:30:02.619
What about you?

01:30:04.399 --> 01:30:07.926
This isn't my war.
Germany has nothing more to do with me.

01:30:28.923 --> 01:30:31.289
- I'm not going with you to Nairobi.
- What?

01:30:31.359 --> 01:30:34.988
I'm staying here with Owuor.
I've made up my mind.

01:30:35.196 --> 01:30:37.756
Be reasonable.
It's too dangerous here for you.

01:30:37.832 --> 01:30:39.527
Leave us your gun.

01:30:43.004 --> 01:30:46.235
For the past few years
you've wanted to be somewhere else.

01:30:46.307 --> 01:30:50.209
You wanted to return to Germany,
then Rongai. You were never satisfied.

01:30:50.278 --> 01:30:54.339
- And now you don't want to leave here.
- I'm not afraid of being alone.

01:30:54.415 --> 01:30:58.818
- You'll be among people in Nairobi.
- I don't want to keep following you!

01:31:01.622 --> 01:31:04.216
What if something happens to you?

01:31:04.325 --> 01:31:08.125
You're the one who should watch out.
They're sending men to Burma.

01:31:10.765 --> 01:31:15.259
For the first time in years, I feel
I'm doing something out of conviction.

01:31:15.736 --> 01:31:19.502
I can't keep sitting around here.
I feel so useless.

01:31:22.577 --> 01:31:25.512
- I understand.
- Then come with me to Nairobi.

01:31:27.982 --> 01:31:29.916
I'm staying here with Owuor.

01:32:52.366 --> 01:32:55.096
If I don't see you for a day, where are you?

01:32:55.403 --> 01:32:57.837
I go see my wives and my children.

01:32:58.239 --> 01:33:00.230
On the lake. Near Kisumu.

01:33:00.408 --> 01:33:02.239
They don't often see you.

01:33:03.244 --> 01:33:06.771
They understand that I can't leave
the memsaab alone so often.

01:33:16.624 --> 01:33:20.526
- But your wife is always alone.
- That's different.

01:33:21.028 --> 01:33:23.588
White women are helpless,
black women are not.

01:33:25.666 --> 01:33:27.531
How many children do you have?

01:33:27.602 --> 01:33:30.036
I have six children and three wives.

01:33:31.272 --> 01:33:32.637
Three wives?

01:33:33.140 --> 01:33:36.405
- Then you have a lot to do!
- I bring them my money.

01:33:37.678 --> 01:33:41.136
It isn't much. 12 shillings isn't much.

01:33:41.349 --> 01:33:44.375
It's enough.
They have shambas with maize and beans...

01:33:44.452 --> 01:33:47.148
and fish from the lake.

01:33:48.155 --> 01:33:49.588
Do they respect you?

01:33:49.657 --> 01:33:50.919
They respect me.

01:33:51.292 --> 01:33:53.590
I work in the house of a bwana.

01:34:00.301 --> 01:34:02.496
I respect you very much, too.

01:34:03.104 --> 01:34:06.540
I don't know what we'd have done
in this country without you.

01:34:08.242 --> 01:34:10.210
Will you help me?

01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:15.313
I'm a cook, not a barber.

01:34:17.351 --> 01:34:19.819
Please! I can't do it alone.

01:34:59.260 --> 01:35:01.057
So your maize fields are fine?

01:35:02.163 --> 01:35:05.360
The maize? Yes, it's doing well.

01:35:08.736 --> 01:35:10.567
Like to go out for a drive?

01:35:11.105 --> 01:35:12.231
Yes.

01:35:12.573 --> 01:35:13.870
I'd love to.

01:35:14.709 --> 01:35:16.677
Then I'll wait for you outside.

01:35:19.380 --> 01:35:21.041
I'm glad you're here.

01:35:39.900 --> 01:35:42.095
This country is so beautiful!

01:35:43.237 --> 01:35:47.799
The Allies landed on the French coast
with over 300,000 men.

01:35:47.908 --> 01:35:50.934
Thank you. So is that good or bad?

01:35:51.479 --> 01:35:54.004
Bad for Hitler, so I'd say it's good.

01:35:55.883 --> 01:35:58.351
Don't you care what happens in Germany?

01:35:59.987 --> 01:36:01.215
And you?

01:36:02.890 --> 01:36:05.381
- What's wrong?
- Don't do this to me.

01:36:08.829 --> 01:36:10.421
What am I doing?

01:36:10.965 --> 01:36:13.195
Come on! It’ll be dark in two hours.

01:36:28.849 --> 01:36:30.510
You're already here?

01:36:31.185 --> 01:36:32.675
I was worried.

01:36:35.623 --> 01:36:36.817
Regina!

01:36:37.491 --> 01:36:41.484
I showed your mother Lake Bogoria.
We were very near your school.

01:36:49.203 --> 01:36:52.297
Why are you angry at me?
Because I wasn't here?

01:36:53.908 --> 01:36:56.274
Why didn't you go to Nairobi with Papa?

01:36:56.343 --> 01:36:59.642
You're asking me?
You're the one who loves this farm!

01:37:03.551 --> 01:37:05.678
You don't love him anymore.

01:37:07.888 --> 01:37:10.823
Süsskind took me out for a drive. That's all.

01:37:12.927 --> 01:37:17.023
Don't you think I was aware of what
happened at the Norfolk?

01:37:17.765 --> 01:37:20.290
You had an affair with that soldier.

01:37:22.570 --> 01:37:25.038
He organized this farm for us.
We had no home.

01:37:25.339 --> 01:37:28.570
I see. What can Süsskind do for you
when you sleep with him?

01:37:56.637 --> 01:37:58.400
Have you seen my child?

01:37:58.472 --> 01:38:00.440
The Mzungu child?

01:38:00.808 --> 01:38:02.901
- Back there in the hut.
- Thank you.

01:38:23.864 --> 01:38:25.889
I'll be right there, Mama.

01:38:47.721 --> 01:38:50.383
I've often spent the night
with Jogona and his mother.

01:38:50.457 --> 01:38:51.515
Often?

01:38:51.592 --> 01:38:54.755
You didn't notice,
because I was home by sunrise.

01:38:55.496 --> 01:38:59.057
My wild little girl. Don't disappear like that.

01:39:03.404 --> 01:39:07.135
It's so beautiful, Mama.
I understand why you wanted it.

01:39:07.541 --> 01:39:11.238
Don't tell Papa. He almost sent me back
to Germany because of that dress.

01:39:11.378 --> 01:39:14.677
- And you've never worn it?
- Never.

01:39:15.015 --> 01:39:18.746
I was just able to prevent him
from wrapping the meat in it.

01:39:19.954 --> 01:39:24.050
Your grandmother and I bought it
in Breslau for 45 marks.

01:39:25.259 --> 01:39:28.592
After that we had some cheesecake
at Café Mohnheim.

01:39:31.799 --> 01:39:34.029
I can't remember Germany at all.

01:39:35.169 --> 01:39:38.138
Only when I eat nuts.
Then I think of Grandpa.

01:39:43.577 --> 01:39:47.104
Mama, why are the Jews hated?

01:39:47.681 --> 01:39:50.912
You and Papa aren't really Jewish.

01:39:51.285 --> 01:39:54.812
You eat all kinds of meat,
and you never pray, do you?

01:39:54.989 --> 01:39:56.684
Here I do sometimes.

01:39:59.526 --> 01:40:02.791
At school they say that the Jews
killed the son of God.

01:40:05.699 --> 01:40:08.998
Judaism has never been
so important for Papa and me.

01:40:10.070 --> 01:40:12.834
We thought we were as German
as anyone could be.

01:40:14.274 --> 01:40:17.732
German culture, the language,
that was home to us.

01:40:18.912 --> 01:40:21.813
Maybe we Jews really are different.

01:40:22.216 --> 01:40:25.117
Do you remember Aunt Ruth
and Uncle Salomon?

01:40:25.252 --> 01:40:26.981
Of course they're different.

01:40:27.354 --> 01:40:31.450
They live according to the Jewish religion,
and that makes them different.

01:40:31.592 --> 01:40:35.358
Tolerance doesn't mean that everyone
is the same. That'd be stupid.

01:40:37.464 --> 01:40:41.560
What I've learned here
is how valuable differences are.

01:40:44.938 --> 01:40:46.906
Differences are good.

01:40:47.674 --> 01:40:50.905
And intelligent people
will never hold it against you.

01:40:54.915 --> 01:40:57.611
The Pokots are celebrating
a big <i>ngoma</i> tonight.

01:40:58.018 --> 01:41:01.920
They slaughtered a cow under the holy
tree. There'll be beer and singing.

01:41:06.427 --> 01:41:07.894
You have to see it.

01:41:08.429 --> 01:41:10.124
It is very "different."

01:43:50.924 --> 01:43:52.755
9 May 1945

01:44:30.497 --> 01:44:32.590
The war in Germany is over.

01:44:43.577 --> 01:44:47.206
A few days ago I got a letter
from a German teacher in Tarnopol.

01:44:47.281 --> 01:44:49.010
From whom?

01:44:49.349 --> 01:44:50.816
I don't know the man.

01:44:51.785 --> 01:44:54.015
He was a teacher before the war.

01:44:55.555 --> 01:44:57.489
<i>He knew Father and Liesl.</i>

01:45:05.999 --> 01:45:08.092
Father gave him my address.

01:45:08.869 --> 01:45:10.734
A week before his death.

01:45:21.148 --> 01:45:23.912
<i>Father and Liesl hid</i>
<i>in the basement of a school.</i>

01:45:25.385 --> 01:45:29.879
Father was beaten to death
by two SS men on 17 November 1942.

01:45:33.427 --> 01:45:37.193
Liesl was taken to Belsec a month later
with the third transport.

01:45:37.631 --> 01:45:39.189
Nobody returned.

01:45:44.571 --> 01:45:48.234
She got married while fleeing, to a Czech...

01:45:49.009 --> 01:45:50.533
Erwin Schweiger.

01:45:51.445 --> 01:45:53.242
He was a truck driver.

01:47:14.694 --> 01:47:17.595
<i>Wiesbaden, 4 November 1946.</i>

01:47:17.798 --> 01:47:19.425
<i>Dear Dr. Redlich:</i>

01:47:20.233 --> 01:47:24.397
<i>It is our pleasure to inform you</i>
<i>that your application...</i>

01:47:24.538 --> 01:47:29.498
<i>for a position in the Justice Dept.</i>
<i>Of Hesse has been accepted.</i>

01:47:29.676 --> 01:47:33.339
<i>You will be installed as a judge</i>
<i>at the Frankfurt District Court.</i>

01:47:33.413 --> 01:47:37.281
<i>Your wish to participate in rebuilding</i>
<i>a liberal system of justice...</i>

01:47:37.350 --> 01:47:40.877
<i>is seen as a sign of hope</i>
<i>for the budding democracy in our state.</i>

01:47:40.954 --> 01:47:44.913
<i>While expressing our best wishes</i>
<i>to you and your family...</i>

01:47:44.991 --> 01:47:49.587
<i>I remain yours sincerely,</i>
<i>Dr. Erwin Pollitzer...</i>

01:47:49.696 --> 01:47:52.358
<i>Department of Justice, Hesse, Germany.</i>

01:48:56.696 --> 01:49:00.564
- How did you get here?
- A uniform can work wonders.

01:49:01.701 --> 01:49:03.669
Want to see where I sit?

01:49:05.205 --> 01:49:07.298
I sit here, and Inge sits there.

01:49:07.374 --> 01:49:12.175
And a girl from the 9th grade sits
at the head, a stupid English cow!

01:49:17.651 --> 01:49:19.016
What's wrong?

01:49:19.819 --> 01:49:22.549
- Is something wrong with Mama?
- No, don't worry.

01:49:22.689 --> 01:49:24.486
Everything's fine.

01:49:26.026 --> 01:49:27.653
I need your help.

01:49:29.896 --> 01:49:31.693
I want to return to Germany.

01:49:33.133 --> 01:49:35.829
I know. You want to, and Mama doesn't.

01:49:37.771 --> 01:49:40.365
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

01:49:40.473 --> 01:49:42.532
I want to and I have to return.

01:49:42.776 --> 01:49:45.210
Please, don't make it so difficult for me.

01:49:48.048 --> 01:49:50.642
I could never forgive myself
for making you unhappy.

01:49:51.618 --> 01:49:53.745
Why do we have to go back to Germany?

01:49:53.820 --> 01:49:55.879
The others don't have to.

01:49:55.956 --> 01:49:59.448
Inge said her father's becoming
an Englishman. You can, too.

01:49:59.526 --> 01:50:01.551
You're in the army, and he isn't.

01:50:03.730 --> 01:50:07.723
Perhaps Inge's father
will get an English passport.

01:50:07.801 --> 01:50:10.531
But that doesn't mean
he'll ever be an Englishman.

01:50:10.604 --> 01:50:14.836
Do you really think an English family
would ever invite him over?

01:50:14.908 --> 01:50:16.876
For example, your headmaster Brinkley.

01:50:16.943 --> 01:50:19.343
- He never would.
- Or anyone else.

01:50:20.180 --> 01:50:22.273
An English passport isn't enough for me.

01:50:22.349 --> 01:50:25.716
I don't want to be a man
with a name that isn't mine.

01:50:25.785 --> 01:50:29.915
I would always be an outsider in Kenya.
Do you know what that means to me?

01:50:30.290 --> 01:50:31.621
Yes, I do.

01:50:34.361 --> 01:50:35.885
My brave angel.

01:50:38.298 --> 01:50:41.426
Promise you won't be sad
when we go back home.

01:50:42.469 --> 01:50:44.596
Promise you'll trust me.

01:50:50.810 --> 01:50:52.710
If we have to return to Germany...

01:50:56.850 --> 01:50:58.647
can Owuor go with us?

01:51:03.957 --> 01:51:05.356
Not this time.

01:51:35.989 --> 01:51:37.854
Hello, my friend.

01:51:43.263 --> 01:51:45.959
Very nice. Where is the memsaab?

01:51:46.032 --> 01:51:48.728
She's out on the field.
With Bwana Süsskind.

01:51:50.770 --> 01:51:53.000
Was Bwana Süsskind often here?

01:52:22.502 --> 01:52:25.835
Then a corncob fell out of his left pant leg.

01:52:27.173 --> 01:52:31.200
The maize is really tall this year.
The rain came at the right time.

01:52:31.578 --> 01:52:33.910
- Gibson can be...
- This isn't our farm!

01:52:33.980 --> 01:52:36.073
And I don't care about the maize!

01:52:52.232 --> 01:52:54.632
I applied for repatriation.

01:52:55.368 --> 01:52:56.630
For what?

01:53:04.244 --> 01:53:07.145
The army is required to send
its soldiers back home.

01:53:10.884 --> 01:53:13.182
In our case that means Germany.

01:53:14.087 --> 01:53:15.952
They pay for the ship.

01:53:17.991 --> 01:53:20.391
And you decided that all by yourself?

01:53:20.460 --> 01:53:23.452
But there are three of us.
Maybe Regina and I don't want to.

01:53:23.530 --> 01:53:25.327
I've already talked to her.

01:53:30.136 --> 01:53:32.036
Why are you doing this?

01:53:32.639 --> 01:53:35.107
Why don't you talk to me about it?

01:53:43.750 --> 01:53:46.947
I don't understand you!
How can you even consider returning?

01:53:47.020 --> 01:53:48.578
Stay out of this!

01:53:48.721 --> 01:53:51.349
You're not going to destroy my family!

01:53:52.826 --> 01:53:56.318
Know what your problem is?
You don't know who you are!

01:53:57.764 --> 01:54:01.495
We're Jews, Walter,
even if it doesn't mean much to you.

01:54:22.789 --> 01:54:24.757
I'll only say this once.

01:54:26.092 --> 01:54:28.526
If you like, you can stay with me.

01:54:30.697 --> 01:54:32.824
It would make me very happy.

01:54:51.818 --> 01:54:54.753
These will be
the best Königsberger meatballs...

01:54:54.821 --> 01:54:57.119
that memsaab has ever eaten.

01:54:57.724 --> 01:54:59.316
But you don't have any capers.

01:54:59.692 --> 01:55:02.183
And you don't even know what capers are!

01:55:02.262 --> 01:55:04.457
I don't know what capers are...

01:55:04.764 --> 01:55:07.255
but I know that capers aren't necessary!

01:55:15.008 --> 01:55:17.533
Happy New Year, Rummler!

01:55:32.959 --> 01:55:35.587
Maybe it's because she has a girlfriend.

01:55:35.662 --> 01:55:40.656
Those were the best meatballs I've ever had.

01:55:40.733 --> 01:55:41.825
Thank you.

01:55:45.738 --> 01:55:48.798
I believe she prefers your ugali.

01:55:52.312 --> 01:55:55.873
When she was four in Leobschütz
she loved Königsberger meatballs.

01:55:58.985 --> 01:56:00.543
Happy New Year, Jettel.

01:56:05.758 --> 01:56:10.388
We need more guards for the fields.
A lot of corn is being stolen at night.

01:56:12.699 --> 01:56:15.133
Perhaps you could talk to the men.

01:56:18.604 --> 01:56:22.904
Jettel, they're waiting
for my decision in Frankfurt.

01:56:26.379 --> 01:56:28.370
I'm not going back to Germany.

01:56:29.082 --> 01:56:31.642
What about us?
Are you really ready to give us up?

01:56:31.718 --> 01:56:34.186
How can you still believe in that country?

01:56:39.359 --> 01:56:42.453
I'm a lawyer, and I love my job.
Perhaps you'll laugh at me...

01:56:42.528 --> 01:56:45.656
but I feel I could be useful
in a new Germany.

01:56:46.332 --> 01:56:50.735
You're such a damn idealist! Do you
think the Nazis suddenly disappeared?

01:56:50.803 --> 01:56:53.169
We'd have to deal
with our parents' murderers.

01:56:53.239 --> 01:56:57.642
I'm proud to be an idealist, because
it shows that I believe in mankind!

01:56:57.710 --> 01:56:59.371
That may seem naive...

01:56:59.445 --> 01:57:02.312
but every other belief
will lead to destruction!

01:57:08.855 --> 01:57:12.222
This country saved our lives,
but it isn't our country!

01:57:39.085 --> 01:57:42.020
- Can't you sleep?
- No.

01:57:48.828 --> 01:57:52.286
In Germany there's lots of snow
in the winter, you see?

01:57:52.365 --> 01:57:55.027
Isn't all that snow very cold?

01:57:56.302 --> 01:57:57.360
Yes.

01:58:01.941 --> 01:58:03.340
I hate snow.

01:58:16.189 --> 01:58:19.090
Hey, busy beaver,
you're doing Owuor's work.

01:58:19.792 --> 01:58:21.919
Mama needs your help.

01:58:22.395 --> 01:58:23.987
It's harvest time.

01:58:25.364 --> 01:58:28.458
She's managed quite well without me
the past few years.

01:58:29.502 --> 01:58:31.629
I'd rather be at school than here.

01:58:36.209 --> 01:58:37.870
Why is that, Papa?

01:58:45.084 --> 01:58:46.551
I don't know.

02:00:35.995 --> 02:00:37.326
Locusts!

02:01:02.855 --> 02:01:04.482
The locusts are coming!

02:01:04.557 --> 02:01:06.787
Many of them! Many of them!

02:01:12.765 --> 02:01:16.326
When the locusts land on the field,
they'll eat everything!

02:03:23.028 --> 02:03:25.758
They're leaving, Mama! They're leaving!

02:04:17.416 --> 02:04:19.850
Like some? It's good for your voice.

02:04:19.985 --> 02:04:21.316
Thank you.

02:04:31.864 --> 02:04:33.764
Thanks for coming back.

02:06:11.697 --> 02:06:13.892
- You have to be careful.
- Why?

02:06:13.966 --> 02:06:15.729
Because I'm pregnant.

02:06:17.570 --> 02:06:20.630
- From me?
- You bet!

02:06:24.209 --> 02:06:26.609
Jettel, I don't want to lose you.

02:06:55.441 --> 02:06:57.841
Can't we sit like this all night?

02:07:58.637 --> 02:08:01.231
The men and the women in the village
never kiss.

02:08:01.306 --> 02:08:03.638
They don't even know what kissing is.

02:08:03.776 --> 02:08:04.800
Really?

02:08:05.477 --> 02:08:06.944
What a shame.

02:08:15.487 --> 02:08:18.615
Everything I love is lying on this bed.

02:08:36.141 --> 02:08:39.577
<i>The song of the Pokot women</i>
<i>inspired me more than usual.</i>

02:08:40.612 --> 02:08:43.581
<i>That morning,</i>
<i>Papa told me Mama was pregnant.</i>

02:08:45.484 --> 02:08:47.577
<i>I sensed Owuor close by and knew...</i>

02:08:47.653 --> 02:08:50.952
<i>he understood that this good news</i>
<i>was also sad news.</i>

02:09:12.644 --> 02:09:15.807
The letter, I'll tear it up.

02:09:16.281 --> 02:09:19.444
- What letter?
- From the Justice Dept. In Wiesbaden.

02:09:19.518 --> 02:09:21.543
I can't leave without you.

02:09:30.429 --> 02:09:33.592
My parents went to Frankfurt
on their honeymoon.

02:09:34.466 --> 02:09:38.095
The first night my father
got terribly drunk on apple wine.

02:09:39.338 --> 02:09:41.363
And Mama was very disappointed.

02:09:45.611 --> 02:09:48.603
I'm so afraid of the people there.
Aren't you?

02:09:49.782 --> 02:09:51.113
Yes, I am.

02:09:55.954 --> 02:09:57.478
Do you love me?

02:09:59.625 --> 02:10:01.115
If you let me.

02:10:10.736 --> 02:10:12.636
Then you decide for us.

02:12:11.590 --> 02:12:13.558
What are you doing here?

02:12:13.992 --> 02:12:16.426
- I'm waiting for the sun.
- And why?

02:12:16.862 --> 02:12:19.626
Are you going to sell the dog at the market?

02:12:20.599 --> 02:12:22.794
I didn't want you to see me.

02:12:22.868 --> 02:12:25.598
Rummler and I are going on a long safari.

02:12:25.938 --> 02:12:28.566
The first to go on safari has dry eyes.

02:12:34.579 --> 02:12:37.810
A man must go on safari
when his time has come.

02:12:50.095 --> 02:12:52.222
Tell little memsaab goodbye.

02:12:52.698 --> 02:12:56.065
Should I tell my daughter, "He left
and didn't want to see you again"?

02:12:56.201 --> 02:12:58.396
Should I tell her,
"Rummler is gone forever"?

02:12:58.537 --> 02:13:00.971
The dog is a part of my child.

02:13:01.340 --> 02:13:04.605
You were there
when Rummler and Regina became friends.

02:13:05.844 --> 02:13:10.508
The little memsaab will understand.
She always understands everything.

02:13:10.983 --> 02:13:12.974
She has eyes and a heart like us.

02:13:13.051 --> 02:13:16.043
Please, Owuor. Tell her goodbye.

02:13:16.855 --> 02:13:21.315
Papa, Owuor has to go,
or do you want his heart to dry up?

02:13:21.593 --> 02:13:25.893
- He doesn't want to die.
- What nonsense! Parting won't kill you!

02:13:25.998 --> 02:13:28.228
Otherwise I'd already be dead.

02:13:33.939 --> 02:13:36.874
Here is my black robe. You've forgotten it.

02:13:37.576 --> 02:13:40.773
I haven't forgotten anything.
The robe doesn't belong to me.

02:13:40.846 --> 02:13:44.009
But I gave it to you when you saved my life!

02:13:44.850 --> 02:13:48.183
At that time you told me,
"I don't need the robe anymore.

02:13:48.253 --> 02:13:50.778
"It is from a life which I have lost."

02:13:50.889 --> 02:13:53.289
Now you've found that life again...

02:13:53.458 --> 02:13:55.358
the life with the robe.

02:13:57.596 --> 02:14:01.225
Please, Owuor, take it!
Without the robe you'll forget me.

02:14:02.834 --> 02:14:04.631
My head won't forget you, bwana.

02:14:04.736 --> 02:14:07.364
I have learned so many words from you.

02:14:11.410 --> 02:14:15.642
No, Owuor. Pick me up again
like my first day in Rongai!

02:14:20.886 --> 02:14:23.980
Don't leave. You don't want to go on safari.

02:14:24.056 --> 02:14:26.820
Take care of bwana. He is still like a child!

02:14:26.892 --> 02:14:29.986
You are wise. You must show him the way!

02:15:10.902 --> 02:15:12.392
All the best.

02:15:13.071 --> 02:15:15.562
Same to you. Thank you.

02:15:29.621 --> 02:15:31.555
I hope you'll find happiness.

02:15:34.926 --> 02:15:36.860
Take care of yourself.

02:16:46.831 --> 02:16:48.628
I can't buy anything.

02:16:48.900 --> 02:16:50.959
I'm as poor as a monkey.

02:16:51.770 --> 02:16:54.102
- For the monkey.
- Thank you.

02:17:21.633 --> 02:17:24.966
<i>My brother was born on 6 June 1947.</i>

02:17:25.403 --> 02:17:29.736
<i>Thanks to the almighty god Ngai,</i>
<i>there were no complications.</i>

02:17:30.075 --> 02:17:33.202
<i>He was big and strong,</i>
<i>and my parents named him Max...</i>

02:17:33.278 --> 02:17:35.075
<i>after my grandfather.</i>
