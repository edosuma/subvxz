00:55.250 --> 00:58.250
<i>Kip is helping Tilly take a bath today.</i>

00:58.333 --> 01:03.666
It's splishy-splashy time,
starring Tilly the Tortoise!

01:04.750 --> 01:06.500
<i>Pào pào.</i>

01:06.583 --> 01:08.500
Yeah, there's a bubble!

01:09.083 --> 01:11.291
Hey, watch me do a magic trick.

01:11.375 --> 01:17.041
I, Kip the Magician,
shall now make this bubble disappear!

01:17.125 --> 01:18.875
Presto!

01:18.958 --> 01:20.583
The bubble is gone!

01:21.666 --> 01:25.750
Thank you, thank you,
and thank <i>you</i>, Tilly.

01:26.333 --> 01:29.333
All right, you're all clean now.
Bath time's done.

01:29.416 --> 01:31.291
Oh, it's Clickety Clock!

01:31.916 --> 01:35.583
Clickety, you made a bubble disappear.
You're a magician too.

01:36.958 --> 01:41.041
There he goes. Well, come on, Tilly.
Let's go. Let's catch him.

01:42.708 --> 01:44.041
Gotcha, Clickety!

01:44.125 --> 01:48.666
Hey, Franny! Bailey!
Lulu! Clickety's here!

01:49.416 --> 01:51.666
-Hi!
-Hi, Clickety Clock.

01:51.750 --> 01:54.083
What time is it, big kids?

01:55.583 --> 01:57.000
<i>Time to play!</i>

01:59.625 --> 02:01.666
Well, what should we play?

02:01.750 --> 02:06.166
Well, I liked being a magician
and making that bubble disappear, so…

02:06.916 --> 02:08.916
I know! Tilly, listen.

02:10.708 --> 02:11.916
Come with me!

02:12.000 --> 02:13.500
But, wait, Kip…

02:13.958 --> 02:16.416
-What are we going to play?
-I don't know.

02:16.500 --> 02:18.291
Come to the playroom in a bit,

02:18.375 --> 02:21.750
and then we'll have
a big surprise for you! Oh boy!

02:21.833 --> 02:22.666
But, Kip…

02:29.708 --> 02:30.583
Sorry.

02:31.500 --> 02:33.958
Lulu, why do you have your eyes closed?

02:34.041 --> 02:37.333
Because I love surprises!

02:37.416 --> 02:39.166
Surprise!

02:41.541 --> 02:42.583
Surprise?

02:44.125 --> 02:48.083
-What's that?
-Well, I think it's the surprise.

02:48.583 --> 02:50.000
Where's Kip?

02:52.583 --> 02:55.333
-Hello, playroom!
-Hi!

02:55.416 --> 02:59.625
Welcome to your surprise magic show!

03:02.750 --> 03:05.166
I love magic!

03:05.250 --> 03:10.208
Prepare yourself
for some magical razzle-dazzle.

03:10.291 --> 03:14.541
-Razzle-dazzle-zazzle!
-Yeah!

03:15.125 --> 03:20.958
This is not ordinary magic.
No, no! This is maths magic!

03:21.041 --> 03:26.166
And I'm Kip the Mathemagician!

03:31.208 --> 03:34.583
You know, like someone
who does maths and magic?

03:34.666 --> 03:37.500
Oh, I get it!

03:37.583 --> 03:40.333
Math-e-magician.

03:40.416 --> 03:42.291
Maths magic!

03:42.375 --> 03:44.125
-Yeah!
-Okay!

03:45.500 --> 03:46.333
Fun!

03:46.416 --> 03:50.375
Please welcome my assistant, Tilly!

03:50.458 --> 03:52.500
-Yay, Tilly!
-<i>N ho.</i>

03:53.625 --> 03:59.375
Now watch
as I put three Tyrannosaurus Rexes

03:59.458 --> 04:00.625
onto the stage!

04:02.208 --> 04:05.708
One, two, three.

04:06.291 --> 04:07.750
<i>Bà wáng lóng.</i>

04:08.375 --> 04:13.083
Yeah. <i>Bà wáng lóng</i> means
"Tyrannosaurus Rex" in Mandarin.

04:13.166 --> 04:14.708
That's right.

04:15.708 --> 04:18.375
-It's a magic show.
-Sorry.

04:18.458 --> 04:21.791
How many dinosaurs do we have, Tilly?

04:23.125 --> 04:24.208
<i>Sān.</i>

04:24.291 --> 04:25.250
"Three."

04:25.333 --> 04:30.666
Now watch
as I make one dinosaur disappear!

04:32.333 --> 04:36.500
Presto magico disappearo!

04:42.041 --> 04:46.416
Ta-da! Now there are only two!

04:47.333 --> 04:48.166
<i>Èr.</i>

04:50.666 --> 04:52.500
Is this magic?

04:52.583 --> 04:55.958
How did he do that?!
Where did the dinosaur go?!

04:56.041 --> 04:59.166
I think he just dropped it onto the floor.

04:59.250 --> 05:01.916
No! This is magic!

05:02.000 --> 05:07.666
Okay. Now watch
as I turn two toys into one.

05:09.750 --> 05:14.333
Presto magico disappearo!

05:19.291 --> 05:23.458
Behold! Now there is only one!

05:25.208 --> 05:26.250
<i>Yī.</i>

05:26.750 --> 05:27.958
-Yeah.
-Wow!

05:32.708 --> 05:33.583
Sorry.

05:33.666 --> 05:35.708
I just really liked that trick.

05:36.208 --> 05:42.625
And now, my final trick.
I'll turn one dinosaur into…

05:50.208 --> 05:52.041
I'll turn one into…

05:53.000 --> 05:54.083
Let's see…

05:54.166 --> 05:57.333
Well, there was one, and now there are…

05:59.125 --> 06:01.250
Tilly, what number's next?

06:12.041 --> 06:16.125
-Is the show over?
-I guess so.

06:16.208 --> 06:20.125
Oh, the suspense! I love magic.

06:21.708 --> 06:24.208
-Good job! Yay.
-Yay.

06:24.291 --> 06:29.250
No! It's not done! I just need
to see how many dinosaurs are left.

06:30.375 --> 06:31.291
None!

06:31.791 --> 06:36.833
But I need the number that means none,
or else it's not maths magic.

06:37.416 --> 06:40.708
But is there a number
that's less than one?

06:40.791 --> 06:42.375
I don't know.

06:47.000 --> 06:52.333
Ladies and gents, to solve this problem,
I will make something appear.

06:52.416 --> 06:57.333
With a presto magico, here we go!

06:57.416 --> 07:00.166
Maths Molly!

07:05.375 --> 07:07.083
-Come on!
-Maths Molly!

07:07.166 --> 07:08.166
Wow!

07:08.250 --> 07:12.500
I made Maths Molly appear. I'm that good!

07:13.291 --> 07:17.166
Thank you, thank you, and thank <i>you</i>.

07:18.125 --> 07:19.541
Wait! Wait for me!

07:22.458 --> 07:25.500
<i>The babies are here</i>
<i>to use maths to solve a problem.</i>

07:25.583 --> 07:29.000
We need to find the number
that's less than one.

07:29.083 --> 07:31.625
So I can finish my magic trick.

07:34.458 --> 07:38.250
Big kids,
that's how many Kip started with.

07:38.333 --> 07:39.458
How many is that?

07:41.458 --> 07:42.333
<i>Three.</i>

07:47.291 --> 07:48.958
One disappeared!

07:49.041 --> 07:51.625
How many now, big kids?

07:52.958 --> 07:53.958
<i>Two!</i>

07:59.291 --> 08:01.041
Another one disappeared!

08:01.625 --> 08:04.125
Just like magic!

08:04.208 --> 08:05.041
How many now?

08:07.250 --> 08:08.208
<i>One!</i>

08:13.208 --> 08:15.375
No more dinosaurs. None.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.791
So, what's that number called?

08:19.583 --> 08:20.791
<i>Zero.</i>

08:22.166 --> 08:23.041
Zero.

08:23.125 --> 08:25.583
That's the number we need.

08:28.083 --> 08:30.333
<i>-Líng.</i>
-That's perfect, Tilly!

08:30.416 --> 08:32.416
Now we can finish our trick!

08:32.916 --> 08:35.500
But first, behold!

08:35.583 --> 08:40.875
Kip the Mathemagician
will make a Maths Party!

08:40.958 --> 08:42.291
Yay!

08:44.375 --> 08:45.791
<i>We did it! We did it!</i>

08:45.875 --> 08:47.291
<i>We did maths</i>

08:47.375 --> 08:49.458
<i>We went down the maths path</i>

08:50.375 --> 08:53.291
<i>We stopped to think the problem out</i>

08:53.375 --> 08:56.750
<i>Now it's time to jump and shout</i>

08:56.833 --> 08:57.666
Yeah!

08:57.750 --> 08:59.375
<i>We did it! We did it!</i>

08:59.458 --> 09:00.791
<i>We did maths</i>

09:00.875 --> 09:03.291
<i>We went down the maths path</i>

09:03.791 --> 09:06.458
<i>Maths makes you a supersmartie</i>

09:06.541 --> 09:11.291
<i>So we had a big Maths Party</i>

09:11.375 --> 09:13.916
<i>We did it! We did it! We did maths</i>

09:14.000 --> 09:17.125
<i>We love maths!</i>

09:19.500 --> 09:24.666
Ladies and gents, are you ready
for my final maths magic trick?

09:24.750 --> 09:26.750
-We're ready!
-Ready!

09:27.333 --> 09:32.166
Okay. Presto magico disappearo!

09:35.208 --> 09:39.833
Ta-da! I made one dinosaur disappear!

09:39.916 --> 09:41.583
So now there are…

09:41.666 --> 09:45.291
Tilly, would you please
reveal the magic number?

09:47.791 --> 09:48.625
Yes!

09:48.708 --> 09:51.833
Zero dinosaurs left!

09:54.166 --> 09:55.791
Magic is real.

09:56.291 --> 09:59.125
-Yay!
-Magic, magic!

10:00.458 --> 10:02.250
Thank you!

10:02.333 --> 10:06.666
And a very special thank-you
to my wonderful assistant, Tilly!

10:06.750 --> 10:08.166
Tilly!

10:09.250 --> 10:14.375
That was so much fun!
I want to count down to zero again.

10:14.458 --> 10:17.125
Well, we could play the five babies game.

10:17.208 --> 10:19.500
-Yeah!
-That game counts down!

10:19.583 --> 10:23.791
Yeah! Let's hop, bop,
and disappear like magic!

10:23.875 --> 10:26.750
-Yay!
-Let's go!

10:28.458 --> 10:30.000
<i>Five babies hopping</i>

10:30.083 --> 10:32.625
<i>Hop-hop-hopping round a tree</i>

10:33.291 --> 10:35.500
<i>Kip hop-hoppity hops away</i>

10:35.583 --> 10:37.083
Look! A bumblebee!

10:38.125 --> 10:42.250
<i>Four babies tapping</i>
<i>Tap-tap-tapping on our knees</i>

10:43.041 --> 10:47.666
<i>Let's all get a snack in</i>
<i>Pass the ice cream please</i>

10:47.750 --> 10:49.833
<i>Tilly leaves to take a bath</i>

10:49.916 --> 10:51.791
<i>Now we're only three</i>

10:52.541 --> 10:56.583
<i>Three babies skipping</i>
<i>Skip-skip-skipping on their toes</i>

10:57.125 --> 11:01.291
<i>Skipping round the garden</i>
<i>Bailey stops to smell a rose</i>

11:01.375 --> 11:06.083
<i>So now there's two babies sliding</i>
<i>Slide-slide-sliding down a slide</i>

11:06.916 --> 11:10.875
<i>-Lulu keeps on sliding</i>
<i>-Franny takes off for a ride</i>

11:10.958 --> 11:11.791
See you later!

11:11.875 --> 11:15.708

<i>Dance with Raffe round the room</i>

11:16.333 --> 11:20.333
<i>Everybody join the fun</i>
<i>So I'm not the only one</i>

11:20.416 --> 11:21.250
Come on!

11:21.333 --> 11:25.333
<i>One, two, three, four, five</i>
<i>Count, everyone</i>

11:26.083 --> 11:30.125
<i>-Five, four, three, two, one</i>
<i>-And now we're done</i>

11:30.875 --> 11:33.750
And another way to say "none" is…

11:33.833 --> 11:34.666
<i>Líng.</i>

11:34.750 --> 11:36.291
Zero!

11:37.750 --> 11:43.250
Thanks, big kids! I couldn't have done
my magic trick without you. Yeah.

11:43.333 --> 11:46.291
Now watch me disappear to eat a snack!

11:46.375 --> 11:51.625
Presto magico
Mathemagician Kippo disappearo!

11:52.375 --> 11:53.208
Bye!

12:03.458 --> 12:07.333
<i>The babies are outside today,</i>
<i>playing on the playground.</i>

12:07.416 --> 12:08.291
Hello.

12:10.916 --> 12:13.375
Do you want to go down the slide, Tilly?

12:15.291 --> 12:17.041
I can help you with that.

12:18.500 --> 12:20.208
This way, Raffe.

12:24.041 --> 12:26.041
Here we go!

12:32.958 --> 12:38.708
-Oh no, Raffe!
-Oh no, Tilly!

12:40.333 --> 12:43.625
That was scary, Raffe, but you're okay.

12:46.500 --> 12:47.666
Uh-oh!

12:50.333 --> 12:53.000
-Are you all right, Tilly?
-<i>Shì.</i>

12:53.875 --> 12:54.875
My knee!

12:55.791 --> 12:57.500
Ouch!

12:57.583 --> 13:01.125
Well, hold on, Lulu.
I have just the thing.

13:02.166 --> 13:04.375
-What happened?
-Lulu!

13:04.958 --> 13:08.541
I got an ouchie. Tilly knocked me over.

13:09.791 --> 13:12.125
It's okay. You didn't mean to.

13:13.541 --> 13:18.333
Lulu, would a pretty purple bandage
make your knee feel better?

13:20.458 --> 13:23.125
-Yeah.
-Okay. Nice and clean.

13:24.291 --> 13:25.333
And now…

13:26.333 --> 13:29.208
There you go. Good as new.

13:34.208 --> 13:35.208
<i>Bào bào.</i>

13:37.333 --> 13:38.625
-"Hug."
<i>-Bào bào.</i>

13:38.708 --> 13:41.041
Yes. A hug for Bailey.

13:41.125 --> 13:42.666
Because I love you.

13:44.291 --> 13:45.583
I love you too.

13:46.541 --> 13:50.291
I love you a lot! All the way to ten!

13:50.791 --> 13:54.791
-Ten. That's a big number.
-Sure is. Yeah.

13:55.458 --> 14:00.875
I want to show you <i>how</i> big it is.
We're going to count to ten. Come!

14:00.958 --> 14:02.208
Okay!

14:05.791 --> 14:06.958
<i>One, two, three</i>

14:08.041 --> 14:09.250

14:34.875 --> 14:38.458
<i>When it's time to go to sleep</i>
<i>We can count sheep</i>

14:55.500 --> 15:00.291
Ten <i>is</i> a big number, Lulu.
Thank you for loving me that much.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.250
You're welcome.

15:03.958 --> 15:05.625
How much do you love <i>me</i>?

15:06.833 --> 15:07.958
A lot!

15:08.041 --> 15:10.708
Yeah, but how much?

15:11.583 --> 15:12.541
Well…

15:13.333 --> 15:18.458
I love you
as much as all the stars in the sky.

15:19.041 --> 15:21.708
-Wow!
-Wow!

15:21.791 --> 15:23.625
Is that more than ten?

15:23.708 --> 15:27.041
Well, I think so. There are lots of stars.

15:27.125 --> 15:28.791
How many stars?

15:29.958 --> 15:31.416
I'm not sure.

15:32.375 --> 15:33.625
I need to know.

15:34.291 --> 15:36.541
There's one way you can find out.

15:36.625 --> 15:37.625
-Really?
-How?

15:37.708 --> 15:42.958
You can go into space
in my rocket ship and count the stars!

15:43.041 --> 15:46.041
Yes! Let's go to outer space!

15:46.125 --> 15:47.416
Now, please.

15:47.500 --> 15:49.541
Okay!

15:51.791 --> 15:55.708
Major Bailey, Lieutenant Lulu,
this is Mission Control.

15:55.791 --> 15:58.041
Are you ready for takeoff?

15:59.041 --> 16:00.458
Ready!

16:02.750 --> 16:06.166
It's time to use your imaginations!

16:08.250 --> 16:09.750
We will!

16:10.250 --> 16:12.916
Big kids, can you help us count down?

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
<i>Yes.</i>

16:14.083 --> 16:15.416
<i>Five.</i>

16:15.500 --> 16:16.750
<i>Four.</i>

16:16.833 --> 16:18.000
<i>Three.</i>

16:18.083 --> 16:19.458
<i>Two.</i>

16:19.541 --> 16:21.125
<i>One.</i>

16:21.208 --> 16:24.083
<i>Blastoff!</i>

16:33.250 --> 16:37.708
-Look at all the stars.
-So pretty.

16:38.375 --> 16:41.291
But how many?

16:42.458 --> 16:44.666
Well, let's count them.

16:45.583 --> 16:46.416
There's…

16:47.083 --> 16:47.916
Lulu?

16:56.500 --> 17:03.500
One, two, three, four stars!

17:04.291 --> 17:06.000
But that's not ten.

17:06.875 --> 17:10.541
No, but, well, there are more over here.

17:10.625 --> 17:12.375
Five, six,

17:12.458 --> 17:14.458
seven, eight…

17:15.250 --> 17:16.416
And down there!

17:16.500 --> 17:18.416
…nine, ten…

17:18.500 --> 17:22.375
What about over there?

17:24.083 --> 17:25.166
Oh yeah.

17:25.250 --> 17:29.666
That's a lot more.
I never knew there were so many stars.

17:30.375 --> 17:36.541
Major Bailey, this is Mission Control.
Are you done counting the stars?

17:36.625 --> 17:37.958
Over!

17:40.708 --> 17:42.791
Still counting. Over!

17:44.416 --> 17:49.333
There are more stars over there and there.

17:50.125 --> 17:51.583
And there!

17:52.375 --> 17:54.125
And there!

17:54.208 --> 17:57.333
I don't think I can count all these stars.

17:57.416 --> 18:02.791
How do you count something
that goes on and on forever?

18:02.875 --> 18:08.541
Well, I don't know.
But I think I know someone who does!

18:09.333 --> 18:12.208
Maths Molly!

18:16.875 --> 18:18.375
It's Maths Molly!

18:18.458 --> 18:19.916
Let's follow her.

18:21.708 --> 18:24.750
<i>The babies are here</i>
<i>to use maths to solve a problem.</i>

18:24.833 --> 18:29.083
And we've got a problem.
There are too many stars to count.

18:34.833 --> 18:37.625
How many stars is that, big kids?

18:39.708 --> 18:44.333
<i>One, two, three, four, five, six,</i>

18:44.416 --> 18:47.666
<i>seven, eight, nine, ten!</i>

18:48.916 --> 18:52.416
And that's how much I love Bailey.

18:54.250 --> 18:55.333
Thanks, Lulu.

18:57.041 --> 18:58.750
Look! Even more stars!

18:59.708 --> 19:00.833
How many is that?

19:01.625 --> 19:05.583
I can help you count them.
I'm an excellent counter!

19:07.833 --> 19:10.583
One, two, three--

19:12.083 --> 19:14.000
Now there's even more stars.

19:14.083 --> 19:17.208
Four, five, six--

19:19.875 --> 19:21.458
Seven, eight…

19:21.541 --> 19:25.958
Okay. That's too many stars.

19:26.041 --> 19:27.916
I can't count that high.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.208
Well, me either, and that's the problem.

19:31.291 --> 19:32.500
Big kids,

19:32.583 --> 19:38.875
what do you call a number that's so big,
you could keep counting forever?

19:42.000 --> 19:44.083
<i>Infinity!</i>

19:44.583 --> 19:46.583
Wow!

19:46.666 --> 19:53.083
So, Lulu, that means I love you infinity!

19:55.958 --> 19:59.000
Infinity never ends!

19:59.083 --> 20:03.333
It goes on and on forever.

20:04.666 --> 20:07.958
Thank you, Bail-Bail,
for loving me so much.

20:08.041 --> 20:10.208
Yeah, of course, Lulu.

20:10.750 --> 20:13.125
And now, we can have a…

20:13.875 --> 20:17.166
Maths Party!

20:19.625 --> 20:21.041
<i>We did it! We did it!</i>

20:21.125 --> 20:22.541
<i>We did maths</i>

20:22.625 --> 20:24.708
<i>We went down the maths path</i>

20:25.625 --> 20:28.541
<i>We stopped to think the problem out</i>

20:28.625 --> 20:32.000
<i>Now it's time to jump and shout</i>

20:32.083 --> 20:32.916
Yeah!

20:33.000 --> 20:34.625
<i>We did it! We did it!</i>

20:34.708 --> 20:36.041
<i>We did maths</i>

20:36.125 --> 20:38.375
<i>We went down the maths path</i>

20:39.041 --> 20:41.708
<i>Maths makes you a supersmartie</i>

20:41.791 --> 20:46.541
<i>So we had a big Maths Party</i>

20:46.625 --> 20:49.166
<i>We did it! We did it! We did maths</i>

20:49.750 --> 20:52.333
<i>We love maths!</i>

20:55.666 --> 20:57.208
That's right, Raffe.

20:58.416 --> 20:59.708
Hi, Tilly!

21:00.791 --> 21:02.250
What's wrong?

21:03.541 --> 21:07.708
I think Tilly still feels sad
about hurting your knee.

21:07.791 --> 21:12.208
Well, it's okay, Tilly.
My knee feels fine now.

21:12.291 --> 21:16.583
I don't even need
my bandage any more. See?

21:20.875 --> 21:23.125
<i>W ài n.</i>

21:24.083 --> 21:26.375
I love you too, Tilly.

21:27.541 --> 21:31.041
I love you infinity!

21:33.791 --> 21:35.416
Oh, what's she doing?

21:35.500 --> 21:39.166
I think she's doing
the happy dance. Right, Tilly?

21:40.000 --> 21:41.625
Dance, Tilly, dance!

21:41.708 --> 21:44.666
-Hey! Yeah!
-Yeah!

21:45.625 --> 21:49.375
<i>When you want to cheer up</i>
<i>'Cause you feel a little down</i>

21:49.458 --> 21:52.708
<i>It's a whole lot of fun</i>
<i>To start dancing around</i>

21:52.791 --> 21:55.916
<i>Let your feet take you for a real fun ride</i>

21:56.000 --> 21:58.875
<i>Hop a little</i>
<i>Jump a little, go for a slide</i>

21:58.958 --> 22:01.583
<i>And in no time at all</i>

22:02.083 --> 22:04.625
<i>You'll be having a ball</i>

22:04.708 --> 22:07.750
<i>We can dance, dance, dance</i>
<i>To a happy place</i>

22:07.833 --> 22:11.291
<i>Put a big, big smile on your happy face</i>

22:11.375 --> 22:13.875
<i>Dance, dance, dance to a happy place</i>

22:13.958 --> 22:15.750
<i>When we're dancing together</i>

22:15.833 --> 22:17.583
<i>We feel a lot better</i>

22:17.666 --> 22:20.166
<i>-Get snappy</i>
<i>-And get clappy</i>

22:20.666 --> 22:23.875
<i>Right away you're gonna feel happy</i>

22:23.958 --> 22:26.500
<i>Dance, dance, dance to a happy place</i>

22:26.583 --> 22:29.875
<i>Put a big, big smile on your happy face</i>

22:29.958 --> 22:32.958
<i>Dance, dance, dance to a happy place</i>

22:33.041 --> 22:35.791
<i>Dance to a happy place</i>

22:36.291 --> 22:39.708
Thanks for your help
counting the stars today, big kids.

22:40.625 --> 22:45.416
-We love you infinity!
-We sure do!

22:45.500 --> 22:48.333
As much as all the stars in the sky.

22:54.458 --> 22:55.291
Yeah!

22:55.375 --> 22:57.041
-Bye-bye-bye!
-Bye!

22:57.125 --> 22:58.791
-Bye-bye!
-See you later!

22:58.875 --> 23:00.333
See you later!
