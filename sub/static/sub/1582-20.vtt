Original Air Date on May 4, 2014

00:06.485 --> 00:09.654
Homie! Homie, wake up!

00:09.688 --> 00:11.556
You're having a nightmare.

00:11.590 --> 00:13.758
It's not selling out.
It's co-branding.

00:13.792 --> 00:14.959
Co-branding!

00:14.993 --> 00:16.394
Wake up!

00:18.096 --> 00:20.498
Oh, honey, the best part
of every day

00:20.532 --> 00:22.800
is waking up
to your smiling face.

00:22.834 --> 00:24.168
Oh...

00:24.202 --> 00:26.671
Just like the best day
of my life was when you

00:26.705 --> 00:28.506
gave me your hand
in marriage.

00:28.540 --> 00:30.408
Ooh.

00:30.442 --> 00:32.209
I'd like it back, please.

00:33.679 --> 00:35.179
Hey! Drop it,
you stupid dog!

00:35.213 --> 00:37.081
That's one
of my wife's pieces!

00:37.115 --> 00:39.417
She needs it
to reciprocate high fives!

00:42.654 --> 00:44.755
That's okay, Homie.

00:44.790 --> 00:47.425
I'll just grab another.

00:47.459 --> 00:48.492
Mmm...

00:48.527 --> 00:50.528
Oh... I haven't worn this one

00:50.562 --> 00:52.463
since New Year's.

00:57.235 --> 01:00.204
Hmm. Is it just me,
or does something seem...

01:00.238 --> 01:01.872
weird today?

01:01.907 --> 01:04.208
You're right--
something <i>is</i> different

01:04.242 --> 01:06.444
about the Simpsons today.

01:06.478 --> 01:09.113
Your father's wearing a <i>tie.</i>

01:09.147 --> 01:10.648
Oh, <i>that's</i>
what's different!

01:10.682 --> 01:12.550
That's the one
and only thing.

01:12.584 --> 01:14.385
Maggie! Stop that!

01:14.419 --> 01:16.587
No more playing
with your food.

01:19.391 --> 01:22.059
Aw, they're so cute
when they're Duplo.

01:24.363 --> 01:27.131
Uh, yes, is this a toy store?

01:27.165 --> 01:30.001
Uh-huh. I'm supposed to get
my daughter a birthday present--

01:30.035 --> 01:31.836
hmm, what's it called?

01:31.870 --> 01:34.672
Here it is.
Perky Patty's Princess Shop.

01:36.908 --> 01:40.845
Oh! I'm so sorry--
but I have an awesome excuse:

01:40.879 --> 01:42.480
I was distracted driving.

01:42.514 --> 01:44.081
Oh, don't worry about it.

01:44.116 --> 01:46.584
Good thing
we don't feel pain.

01:46.618 --> 01:48.786
Hey! These are
the monkey's legs!

01:51.690 --> 01:53.491
Come back!
I'm a clown!

01:53.525 --> 01:55.493
I can't afford to
look ridiculous!

01:56.895 --> 01:59.497
Hey, Bart, check out
what I brought for share day.

01:59.531 --> 02:01.766
Whoa! A skunk!

02:01.800 --> 02:03.167
Who should we
stink first?

02:03.201 --> 02:05.403
It can't spray--
it's been de-sacked.

02:05.437 --> 02:06.437
Ew!

02:06.471 --> 02:09.407
The gypsy skunk-seller lied!

02:16.248 --> 02:17.915
He went in there!

02:19.584 --> 02:21.952
Stop it! If you pull
out those bricks,

02:21.987 --> 02:24.021
the whole school
could collapse!

02:24.056 --> 02:26.023
But there's a skunk
in there.

02:26.058 --> 02:28.426
Scottish steak!

02:30.000 --> 02:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:38.236 --> 02:41.772
You are going to rebuild
every brick of this school.

02:41.807 --> 02:43.941
This says:
ages 12 and up.

02:43.975 --> 02:46.777
Age guidelines are conservative,
and everyone knows it.

02:48.947 --> 02:51.182
And to motivate you,
some words of support

02:51.216 --> 02:53.084
from the school chum.

02:56.822 --> 02:58.389
Haw-haw!

02:58.423 --> 03:00.091
Thank you, Nelson.

03:04.863 --> 03:08.065
One Perky Patty's
Princess Shop, please.

03:08.100 --> 03:10.735
Ah. Always good to meet
a fellow AMFOP.

03:10.769 --> 03:13.270
Huh?
Adult Male Fan of Princesses.

03:13.305 --> 03:15.106
It's for my daughter.

03:15.140 --> 03:16.841
Yes, yes, it's always
for the daughter.

03:16.875 --> 03:18.242
Well, that's weird.

03:18.276 --> 03:20.511
I feel like I've seen
this toy before.

03:23.148 --> 03:24.949
Do you like it, honey?

03:24.983 --> 03:27.485
I love it, Dad!
Thank you.

03:27.519 --> 03:30.121
Well, have fun
putting it together.

03:30.155 --> 03:33.023
Wait, wha... Dad, don't you
want to build it <i>with</i> me?

03:33.058 --> 03:34.825
Well, there's no dad on the box.

03:34.860 --> 03:36.727
I don't want to get in trouble.

03:36.762 --> 03:39.396
Of course I do!

03:44.169 --> 03:45.469
Mm-hmm.

03:45.504 --> 03:47.138
Well, what do you know?

03:47.172 --> 03:49.373
I <i>enjoyed</i> playing with you.

03:49.407 --> 03:51.041
Me, too, Dad.

03:51.076 --> 03:52.777
No, no, no.
Listen to me.

03:52.811 --> 03:56.714
We played...
and it wasn't boring.

03:56.748 --> 03:58.249
We've played lots of times.

03:58.283 --> 03:59.650
Of course we have!

03:59.684 --> 04:01.886
Because you're my girl
and I love you.

04:01.920 --> 04:04.121
But I'm letting you in
on a secret.

04:04.156 --> 04:06.290
When parents play
with their kids,

04:06.324 --> 04:08.292
they don't like it.

04:08.326 --> 04:10.761
And I'm no different.
Oh.

04:10.796 --> 04:12.496
Suddenly I can't breathe.

04:12.531 --> 04:16.233
Every fiber of my being
screams out for a nap.

04:16.267 --> 04:18.636
And if someone handed me
an issue of <i>The New Yorker,</i>

04:18.670 --> 04:20.237
I would read the fiction.

04:20.272 --> 04:21.971
I swear to God I would.

04:22.007 --> 04:25.743
Wow. But there are millions
of parents in the world.

04:25.777 --> 04:27.745
Surely some of them like

04:27.779 --> 04:29.413
playing with...
Nope, not even one.

04:29.447 --> 04:32.249
Just look at the things
you kids like: tea parties

04:32.284 --> 04:33.818
with pretend food;

04:33.852 --> 04:36.520
hide-and-seek
with <i>flagrant</i> peeking;

04:36.555 --> 04:40.825
and the most inhumane torture
ever devised by man...

04:42.294 --> 04:44.261
Candy Land.

04:44.296 --> 04:46.163
Oh.
But this...

04:46.198 --> 04:49.133
this is tolerable!

04:50.802 --> 04:52.369
What a crazy vision.

04:52.404 --> 04:55.272
I was in a world where
nothing is made of bricks,

04:55.307 --> 04:56.674
except for toys!

04:56.708 --> 04:58.742
Hey, read the sign.

04:58.777 --> 05:00.544
Thank you.

05:02.647 --> 05:03.747
<i>Marge, I'm telling you,</i>

05:03.782 --> 05:06.016
it was so weird.

05:06.051 --> 05:07.818
My body was squishy,

05:07.853 --> 05:11.789
and my hands looked like
snakes made of meat!

05:11.823 --> 05:13.157
It was horrible!

05:13.191 --> 05:16.594
Oh, Homie, it was
probably just a mini-stroke.

05:16.628 --> 05:18.929
You're just saying that
to make me feel better.

05:18.964 --> 05:20.998
Whatever you saw,
it wasn't real.

05:21.032 --> 05:23.000
That's how the world works.

05:23.034 --> 05:25.202
Everything fits
with everything else,

05:25.237 --> 05:28.372
and nobody ever gets hurt.
I know.

05:28.406 --> 05:30.975
Oh, maybe you
just need someone to...

05:31.009 --> 05:33.677
you know, take
your mind off it?

05:33.712 --> 05:34.879
Hm?

05:34.913 --> 05:36.881
I always need that.

05:36.915 --> 05:40.184
I only don't ask
because being rejected...

05:40.218 --> 05:42.753
gets old.

05:47.092 --> 05:50.694
Oh, baby, I feel
so close to you right now.

05:57.669 --> 05:59.069
Hmm? Hmm?

05:59.104 --> 06:01.272
Marge? Did you replace
our regular mirror

06:01.306 --> 06:03.974
with a magical mirror
from a mystical salesman

06:04.009 --> 06:06.977
at a weird store that
if we went back to find it,

06:07.012 --> 06:08.746
it wouldn't be there anymore?

06:08.780 --> 06:10.881
No.

06:14.342 --> 06:17.574
Okay, Homer, get a grip.
I'm sure lots of people,

06:17.575 --> 06:19.209
every time they
look in the mirror,

06:19.244 --> 06:21.245
see a hideous flesh monster.

06:21.279 --> 06:22.679
Just a one-time thing.

06:24.015 --> 06:25.816
Oh, brick me!

06:25.850 --> 06:27.551
Leave me alone!

06:27.585 --> 06:30.287
Why don't you go back
where you came from!

06:30.321 --> 06:32.623
I have as much right
to be here as you!

06:32.657 --> 06:35.325
I, sir, am in
the Advent calendar!

06:35.360 --> 06:37.628
- Hmm?
- December 18,

06:37.662 --> 06:39.596
final week! Huh?

06:40.832 --> 06:42.332
Moe, I'm going
crazy-- I need

06:42.367 --> 06:44.568
to kill off as many of my
brain cells as possible.

06:44.602 --> 06:46.270
Well, I'm here to help.

06:49.774 --> 06:51.508
What the...?
This isn't beer.

06:51.543 --> 06:53.277
Beer is plastic circles.

06:53.311 --> 06:56.780
- How can I drink...
-  this?

06:58.116 --> 06:59.783
Did you guys see... that?

06:59.818 --> 07:01.852
Oh, it's
getting worse!

07:08.827 --> 07:11.295
Ugh! Rebuilding
the same boring old school.

07:11.329 --> 07:13.764
I could make this place
so much cooler

07:13.798 --> 07:16.300
if they just gave me a chance.

07:26.344 --> 07:28.846
What have you done to my school?

07:28.880 --> 07:30.614
I put in a rock-climbing wall,

07:30.648 --> 07:32.549
all the classrooms
are skate parks,

07:32.584 --> 07:35.853
we got zip-line stairwells,
Terminator gym teachers,

07:35.887 --> 07:38.622
your office is now
a haunted forest--

07:38.656 --> 07:41.024
extra ghosts--
and, if you can believe it,

07:41.059 --> 07:43.327
two tetherball poles.

07:43.361 --> 07:45.005
How will children learn

07:45.030 --> 07:46.804
if they don't feel like
they're in kid jail?

07:47.031 --> 07:48.866
Relax. I used
all the same bricks.

07:48.900 --> 07:50.067
Plus Ralph.

07:50.101 --> 07:52.069
<i>Yo soy</i> language lab.

07:55.373 --> 07:56.694
But I don't want
to go to church--

07:56.712 --> 07:58.542
I'm too busy going crazy.

07:58.543 --> 08:00.911
Come on, Homie.
When I'm troubled,

08:00.945 --> 08:05.382
I always find solace in the
airtight logic of religion.

08:05.416 --> 08:07.651
"Before the world began,

08:07.685 --> 08:10.354
"there was only table.

08:10.388 --> 08:14.658
"Then the Great Constructor
scissored open bag one

08:14.692 --> 08:17.194
"and dumped out the universe.

08:17.228 --> 08:19.663
"Then came the time
of the Great Sorting:

08:19.697 --> 08:22.766
"color to color, shape to shape,
and a pile of just

08:22.800 --> 08:24.835
"windows and doors.

08:24.869 --> 08:28.705
"And everything was made
of eternal, unchanging

08:28.740 --> 08:32.109
acrylonitrile
butadiene styrene,"

08:32.143 --> 08:34.845
or in the common tongue,
"plastic."

08:34.879 --> 08:38.015
But, Reverend, what if
everything <i>isn't</i> made of plastic?

08:38.049 --> 08:39.950
I think there's more
to this world.

08:39.984 --> 08:41.251
You mean like decals?

08:41.285 --> 08:43.120
Well, the Orthodox
don't use them,

08:43.154 --> 08:45.489
but we're
a Reform congregation.

08:47.959 --> 08:50.360
No. I mean a place
where nothing snaps together

08:50.395 --> 08:52.262
and you just
can't toss your kids

08:52.297 --> 08:54.031
in a dishwasher to clean 'em.

08:54.065 --> 08:55.966
Oh, Homer,
a place like that

08:56.000 --> 08:59.236
could only exist in some
kind of magic rock song.

08:59.270 --> 09:01.305
Look around-- we live
in a perfect world

09:01.339 --> 09:03.774
where everything fits together
and no one gets hurt.

09:03.808 --> 09:05.075
Mustache is right.

09:05.109 --> 09:06.743
But I'm having
all these hallucinations.

09:06.778 --> 09:08.579
Like right now
my hands look like

09:08.613 --> 09:10.480
they're these
weird wiggly things.

09:10.515 --> 09:14.084
I think they have a name,
but I can't put my finger on it.

09:16.020 --> 09:17.120
Don't look, boys!

09:18.256 --> 09:19.957
Wait! You guys see them, too?

09:19.991 --> 09:21.558
He's a freak!

09:21.593 --> 09:24.895
Take him apart and lose
the pieces under the couch!

09:24.929 --> 09:27.130
Well, I don't
find him disgusting.

09:27.165 --> 09:29.266
Oh, boy, that's mushy!

09:29.300 --> 09:31.101
Come on, Marge.
We need real answers,

09:31.135 --> 09:33.971
and there's only one
place we can get them!

09:34.005 --> 09:36.240
Let's see, "fingers."

09:36.274 --> 09:39.576
Come on, show me
something about fingers.

09:39.611 --> 09:41.745
Bad news, people.

09:41.779 --> 09:43.981
Our religion is not true.

09:44.015 --> 09:45.482
Sorry about that.

09:45.516 --> 09:46.850
Really sorry.

09:48.052 --> 09:49.686
If I'm right,

09:49.721 --> 09:52.022
when I touch this box,
it'll trigger another memory

09:52.056 --> 09:53.957
from some alternate
me's life.

09:53.992 --> 09:56.126
If I don't come back
from that other place,

09:56.160 --> 09:58.562
tell my wife I loved her.

09:58.596 --> 10:00.030
I'm right here.

10:00.064 --> 10:01.698
Promise me!

10:04.002 --> 10:07.604
I can't believe all the time
I wasted playing with Bart

10:07.639 --> 10:09.873
when I could have
been playing with you.

10:09.907 --> 10:11.308
Aw...

10:11.342 --> 10:14.378
Our little Springfield
is really turning out great.

10:14.412 --> 10:16.380
City Hall,
the weird-smelling bank,

10:16.414 --> 10:17.648
Rehab World...

10:17.682 --> 10:19.783
Krustyburger,
Krustyburger Express,

10:19.817 --> 10:22.019
the Krustyburger where
the governor got stabbed...

10:22.053 --> 10:23.854
Oh, you two.

10:23.888 --> 10:26.957
Hey, look what I found
in the "Arts-Weekend-Obituary" section

10:26.991 --> 10:28.392
of the paper.

10:28.426 --> 10:30.694
A builders competition!

10:30.728 --> 10:32.462
We got to enter
our mini-Springfield.

10:32.497 --> 10:33.797
We're a great team!

10:33.831 --> 10:35.899
We're there.
I'll clear my calendar.

10:37.735 --> 10:40.137
Hey, Lenny, remember those
two surfers we were gonna fight?

10:40.171 --> 10:41.738
Well, you're on your own.

10:41.773 --> 10:43.840
But you're the one
who sat on their fish tacos.

10:43.875 --> 10:45.275
Great talking to you, buddy.

10:48.713 --> 10:51.214
Lisa, Lisa,
I spent all day at work

10:51.249 --> 10:54.217
making a Duff brewery
for our mini-Springfield.

10:54.252 --> 10:58.221
I don't want to brag,
but... it really brews.

10:58.256 --> 11:01.024
Huh? Where is she?

11:01.059 --> 11:05.829
Okay, I got us tickets for
the 7:30 show of <i>Survival Games.</i>

11:05.863 --> 11:07.864
I've never been
to a PG-13 movie before.

11:07.899 --> 11:11.401
I wonder what the one
swear word will be.

11:11.436 --> 11:12.836
What if it's...

11:14.472 --> 11:16.740
Oh, I've never
heard that one.

11:16.774 --> 11:19.076
My grampa said it
at Thanksgiving.

11:19.110 --> 11:21.378
We usually don't hang out
with second graders,

11:21.412 --> 11:23.780
but we saw your <i>Survival Games</i>
book report

11:23.815 --> 11:26.917
hanging in the hallway,
and we were very impressed.

11:26.951 --> 11:30.721
You really understood that
the theme of the book was love.

11:30.755 --> 11:32.956
Hey, older girls,
I'm Homer Simpson.

11:32.990 --> 11:35.992
That's right. Lisa's
playtime partner and BFF.

11:38.429 --> 11:41.865
I assume Lisa told you
about the pretend tiny town

11:41.899 --> 11:44.701
she's building
with her overweight father.

11:44.736 --> 11:47.471
Oh, yeah,
it's gonna be mucho fresh.

11:47.505 --> 11:51.141
Come on, honey.
It's time to click some bricks.

11:51.175 --> 11:53.810
I don't know what
he's doing up here.

11:53.845 --> 11:56.279
He usually stays
in the basement.

11:56.314 --> 11:58.749
It's okay, Lisa.
We have dads, too.

11:58.783 --> 12:00.584
I have three dads.

12:00.618 --> 12:02.586
See you Friday.

12:02.620 --> 12:05.422
Friday? But that's
when Brick-Stock is.

12:05.456 --> 12:08.592
Um, actually,
Friday is the opening night

12:08.626 --> 12:11.328
of the new <i>Survival Games</i> movie,

12:11.362 --> 12:12.963
and they invited me.

12:12.997 --> 12:15.432
But this was <i>our</i> thing.

12:15.466 --> 12:17.000
I know. I'm sorry,

12:17.034 --> 12:18.835
but cool older girls
have never wanted

12:18.870 --> 12:20.470
to hang out with me before.

12:20.505 --> 12:22.139
One of them wears deodorant.

12:22.173 --> 12:23.774
I don't know which one.

12:23.808 --> 12:25.909
Oh. All right.

12:25.943 --> 12:28.345
Thanks for understanding, Dad.

12:29.847 --> 12:31.782
What just happened?

12:31.816 --> 12:33.950
It's not you.
Lisa's growing up.

12:33.985 --> 12:35.919
It's a really complicated time

12:35.953 --> 12:38.021
in a girl's life
from age eight to...

12:38.055 --> 12:40.524
actually,
all the rest of the way.

12:40.558 --> 12:44.127
Oh! I finally found something
I like doing with my daughter,

12:44.162 --> 12:45.629
and now I've lost it.

12:45.663 --> 12:48.064
I don't fit
into her world.

12:48.099 --> 12:49.833
This is for the tacos!

12:49.867 --> 12:52.102
Ow!

12:52.136 --> 12:54.471
Tacos, brah! Ow!

13:01.379 --> 13:02.746
What did you build?

13:02.780 --> 13:04.481
Mmm...

13:04.515 --> 13:06.917
Oh, that's the
teenage crossbow ace

13:06.951 --> 13:08.585
who stole my
daughter from me.

13:08.619 --> 13:11.588
Keendah Wildwill is
a modern feminist hero--

13:11.622 --> 13:13.824
strong, independent
and resourceful.

13:13.858 --> 13:16.860
She's a little...
bustier than I remember.

13:16.894 --> 13:19.229
My work on that front
is never done.

13:25.403 --> 13:28.705
I wish I lived
in little Springfield.

13:28.739 --> 13:32.476
Everything fits together,
and no one ever gets hurt.

13:38.683 --> 13:40.650
<i>Okay...</i>

13:40.685 --> 13:43.286
Apparently, our whole world
is a fantasy in the mind

13:43.321 --> 13:45.755
of an emotionally-devastated
Homer Simpson.

13:45.790 --> 13:49.326
One of the main questions
I have about that is, why?

13:49.360 --> 13:51.761
The real Homer fears
losing his daughter's love,

13:51.796 --> 13:55.532
so he invented this toy world
where nothing will ever change.

13:55.566 --> 13:56.800
How can you
be sure?

13:56.834 --> 13:58.168
I have devoted my life

13:58.202 --> 13:59.769
to second-rate science fiction.

13:59.804 --> 14:01.938
Trust me, that is what
we are dealing with here.

14:01.973 --> 14:04.207
So if I don't find
my way out of here,

14:04.242 --> 14:07.143
I could be trapped
in a fantasy forever?

14:07.178 --> 14:08.712
I'm afraid so.

14:10.248 --> 14:12.516
I'm trapped
in a fantasy forever!

14:12.550 --> 14:15.585
Kiss my flat plastic butt,
reality.

14:17.722 --> 14:18.955
Ooh.

14:18.990 --> 14:21.525
Daddy-daughter time
will never end!

14:24.976 --> 14:28.045
Inventing this toy world to
live in is the smartest thing

14:28.046 --> 14:30.368
my brain-damaged
brain ever did.

14:30.369 --> 14:32.904
Nothing bad can
ever happen here.

14:34.306 --> 14:36.307
Great throw, Homer.

14:38.544 --> 14:40.778
Put it in Tupperware, boys.

14:40.813 --> 14:43.447
We'll rebuild it tomorrow.

14:43.482 --> 14:44.949
Homie, ask yourself--

14:44.983 --> 14:46.651
can you really live
in a paradise

14:46.685 --> 14:48.653
if you know
it's just pretend?

14:48.687 --> 14:52.290
Marge, who would give up
eating steak in the Matrix

14:52.324 --> 14:54.525
to go slurp goo in Zion?

14:54.560 --> 14:56.394
We don't have
that movie here.

14:56.428 --> 14:59.831
Now Lisa can never ditch
me, and I can play with her

14:59.865 --> 15:01.499
forever.

15:03.068 --> 15:05.002
There, I finished.

15:05.037 --> 15:06.537
All 12 of them.

15:06.572 --> 15:09.040
I'll never build
what I want again.

15:09.074 --> 15:10.308
Then you've learned your lesson.

15:10.342 --> 15:12.577
Too bad I got these
for my birthday.

15:12.611 --> 15:14.912
They always give
me the school.

15:17.316 --> 15:18.683
Sparkle Unicorn,

15:18.717 --> 15:20.618
would like some more tea?

15:20.652 --> 15:24.822
Oh, yeah, hook me up with some
more of that imaginary nectar.

15:24.857 --> 15:26.824
I've never seen you
throw yourself

15:26.859 --> 15:28.626
into a tea party like this.

15:28.660 --> 15:31.662
Before, it always seemed like
you were kind of phoning it in.

15:31.697 --> 15:33.164
Not anymore, Lisa.

15:33.198 --> 15:34.699
I've created a perfect world

15:34.733 --> 15:38.302
with no PG-13 movies
to take you away from me.

15:39.838 --> 15:42.039
Ah! 'Cause in a toy town,

15:42.074 --> 15:44.375
everything stays
shiny and wonderful,

15:44.409 --> 15:46.010
just the way I want it.

15:46.044 --> 15:48.379
You'll always be
my little girl.

15:48.413 --> 15:51.015
Maggie will always
be my giant baby.

15:51.049 --> 15:53.050
Bart will never
move out of the house.

15:53.085 --> 15:55.286
I'll work for Mr. Burns forever.

15:55.320 --> 15:57.555
Marge and I will never
grow old together

15:57.589 --> 15:59.991
and live like fat cats
on Social Security.

16:00.025 --> 16:01.225
Good Lord,

16:01.260 --> 16:02.660
I'll never experience

16:02.694 --> 16:04.795
the ultimate reward
for a life well lived--

16:04.830 --> 16:08.032
the gentle
slumber of death.

16:08.066 --> 16:09.700
Marge, I made a
terrible mistake!

16:09.735 --> 16:11.569
The fact that
kids grow up is

16:11.603 --> 16:13.537
what makes time
with them special.

16:13.572 --> 16:15.339
I think I need to go back.

16:15.374 --> 16:16.741
I wish you'd told me that

16:16.775 --> 16:18.509
before I bought
all these groceries.

16:18.543 --> 16:20.278
But I understand.

16:20.312 --> 16:23.714
Lego Marge, you're just
as cool as Real Marge.

16:23.749 --> 16:25.783
Who?!
Nobody, nobody.

16:25.817 --> 16:28.286
Plastic Comic Book Guy,
I need to go back home.

16:28.320 --> 16:31.155
Home? But you've discovered
the joy of living in a world

16:31.189 --> 16:33.324
made of toys where nothing bad
can ever happen.

16:35.694 --> 16:39.263
But I miss
burning my mouth on pizza,

16:39.298 --> 16:43.434
and David Blaine stunts
where he could really die.

16:43.468 --> 16:45.303
Now tell me how to
get out of here!

16:45.337 --> 16:47.371
All you need to do
is open the box back

16:47.406 --> 16:49.473
to your so-called reality.

16:49.508 --> 16:52.843
But I can't let that happen.

16:54.680 --> 16:56.480
Huh? You're the bad guy?

16:56.515 --> 16:58.783
I thought you were
the rule-explainer guy.

16:58.817 --> 17:01.319
As an adult who surrounds
himself with child's toys,

17:01.353 --> 17:03.287
I represent the part
of your psyche

17:03.322 --> 17:05.522
that prefers
<i>this</i> artificial world.

17:08.393 --> 17:09.794
How did you do that?!

17:09.828 --> 17:12.630
Because,
as the ultimate collector,

17:12.664 --> 17:16.300
I have every play set ever made.

17:16.335 --> 17:17.601
Huh?

17:17.636 --> 17:20.037
Pirates!

17:21.673 --> 17:23.574
Pajama guys!

17:25.010 --> 17:27.044
I'll never get home.

17:27.079 --> 17:29.313
Who could build something
awesome enough to save me?

17:29.348 --> 17:30.715
Who?

17:30.749 --> 17:34.085
<i>Who?! Who?!</i>

17:34.119 --> 17:36.220
Don't you even think about it.

17:37.856 --> 17:40.358
You are thinking about it,
aren't you?

17:51.269 --> 17:54.271
You are going back
where you came from--

17:54.306 --> 17:55.673
Denmark.

17:55.707 --> 17:57.274
What is that thing?

17:57.309 --> 18:00.177
I have no idea,
but it's gonna kick his butt.

18:00.212 --> 18:02.246
That robot is made
out of Batmobile,

18:02.280 --> 18:04.348
Hobbit hole
and SpongeBob play sets.

18:04.383 --> 18:07.051
That's...
that's mis-set-genation.

18:07.085 --> 18:08.786
Kid power.

18:08.820 --> 18:11.122
Lion blast!

18:12.324 --> 18:13.891
Lightsaber barf!

18:19.664 --> 18:22.199
Fire Principal!

18:22.234 --> 18:24.535
This is strangely exhilarating.

18:24.569 --> 18:26.037
No. No.

18:26.071 --> 18:28.239
No!

18:28.273 --> 18:32.309
I am going to enjoy playing
with this thing forever!

18:34.012 --> 18:36.080
I'm a creative
but undisciplined builder!

18:50.429 --> 18:51.896
Good-bye, Homie.

18:51.930 --> 18:54.098
Your squishy meat family
is lucky

18:54.132 --> 18:56.067
to have a good man like you.

18:56.101 --> 18:58.636
Oh, baby, no matter
what the reality,

18:58.670 --> 19:01.105
you're the best
thing in it.

19:04.443 --> 19:07.011
Hmm. That was a
little weird, right?

19:08.680 --> 19:10.181
A little bit.

19:14.953 --> 19:16.587
Dad, wake up.

19:16.621 --> 19:18.222
Wake up.

19:22.360 --> 19:25.663
Oh, Meat Lisa, it's you.

19:25.697 --> 19:27.264
Are you okay?

19:27.299 --> 19:29.333
Oh, I had this crazy dream

19:29.367 --> 19:31.735
where I was in a world
made of Lego bricks

19:31.770 --> 19:34.472
and learned important lessons
about parenting.

19:34.506 --> 19:36.874
Mmm, isn't that kind of
the plot of the...?

19:36.908 --> 19:38.342
No. No, it's not.

19:38.376 --> 19:39.877
It's a <i>new</i> plot.

19:39.911 --> 19:41.345
Honey, what are you doing here?

19:41.379 --> 19:42.899
I thought you were
going to your movie.

19:42.914 --> 19:44.315
I changed my mind.

19:44.349 --> 19:46.150
I knew how much
this meant to you.

19:46.184 --> 19:48.552
No, no, go to the movie
with your friends.

19:48.587 --> 19:50.454
If there's one thing
I've learned,

19:50.489 --> 19:53.324
it's that I can't stop you
from growing up.

19:53.358 --> 19:54.725
I love you, Dad.

19:54.759 --> 19:56.861
Me, too, little girl.

19:59.331 --> 20:04.331
== sync, corrected by <font color=#00FF00>elderman</font> ==
<font color=#00FFFF>@elder_man</font>

20:30.513 --> 20:33.849
Thayson, Joshuel, don't make me
pick between you two

20:33.883 --> 20:36.518
on the night before I reenter
the Struggle Dome again.

20:36.552 --> 20:37.986
We'll never stop loving you,

20:38.020 --> 20:40.488
even if you string
us along forever.

20:40.523 --> 20:42.591
Forever.
Forever.

20:42.625 --> 20:45.160
How can I choose
between two boys,

20:45.194 --> 20:47.395
one who's dangerous
but good-looking,

20:47.430 --> 20:49.698
the other who's strong
but super cute?

20:49.732 --> 20:51.499
Ah!

20:51.534 --> 20:54.336
Oh, my God,
this is terrible.

20:54.370 --> 20:56.538
When do they get
to killing the children?

20:56.572 --> 20:57.873
Shh!

20:57.907 --> 20:59.774
Wait a second.
You're not into this...

20:59.809 --> 21:01.243
Shh!

21:01.277 --> 21:02.911
She's trying
on dresses.

21:02.945 --> 21:07.048
Oh, I just wanted to see kids
fight to the death, is all.

21:07.083 --> 21:09.718
Shh...!

21:52.471 --> 21:53.710
Shh!
