00:34.410 --> 00:37.696
On January 31, 2011, due to a
reduced demand for Sheetrock,

00:37.720 --> 00:43.011
US Gypsum shut down its plant
in Empire, Nevada, after 88 years.

00:44.480 --> 00:52.480
By July, the Empire zip code,
89405, was discontinued.

02:08.805 --> 02:11.988
- Okay. Here's what I owe you.
- Okay, thank you.

02:23.210 --> 02:25.550
You take care of yourself.

03:18.080 --> 03:23.949
♪ What child is this who lay to rest ♪

03:23.950 --> 03:29.249

03:52.580 --> 03:54.979
I don't see your reservation.

03:55.003 --> 03:57.780
I'm on the Amazon CamperForce list.

04:00.610 --> 04:02.186
Try MCD.

04:02.210 --> 04:03.750
- There it is.
- Yeah.

05:06.480 --> 05:09.550
Good morning everybody.
How's everybody doing today?

05:09.903 --> 05:13.356
All right. Let me get a safety tip.

05:13.380 --> 05:15.009
Three point contact.

05:15.010 --> 05:17.656
Why is it important to maintain
three points of contact?

05:17.680 --> 05:21.286
- So you don't fall down the stairs.
- We don't fall down the stairs.

05:21.310 --> 05:24.150
Can I guess that was work tip from you.

05:40.750 --> 05:42.609
- This is Carl.
- Hi.

05:42.610 --> 05:44.856
- This is Angela.
- Hey.

05:44.880 --> 05:48.749
Doug, Ryan, Teresa.

05:48.750 --> 05:50.279
- Karie.
- Good to meet you.

05:50.280 --> 05:53.256
- And your good ol' friend.
- Linda May. And I'm Fern.

05:53.280 --> 05:55.109
This is my friend, Fern.

05:55.110 --> 05:56.609
- Hi everybody.
- Hey, how are you doing?

05:56.610 --> 05:58.681
Another Smith lyric I have is:

05:58.705 --> 06:00.977
When you laughing, and dancing,
and finally living

06:01.001 --> 06:03.271
you hear my voice in your head
and think of me kindly.

06:03.295 --> 06:06.212
And then also the one
that means the most to me is:

06:06.236 --> 06:07.509
"Home", is it just a word

06:07.510 --> 06:11.464
or is it something that
you carry within you? So...

06:11.580 --> 06:13.577
- I like that one.
- Me too.

06:13.601 --> 06:16.280
Like his lyrics are very deep.

06:37.950 --> 06:39.243
- Yes.
- No.

06:39.267 --> 06:41.565
So, the guy that had the van
before he just had a mattress

06:41.589 --> 06:43.689
in the back but I didn't
want to keep it that way.

06:43.713 --> 06:46.456
I wanted to build a bed up,
so I can have the storage underneath.

06:46.480 --> 06:48.949
I got these storage drawers.

06:48.950 --> 06:52.149
One set in the front, so I can get in
to them from the inside.

06:52.150 --> 06:54.504
And then another on the outside.

06:54.528 --> 06:57.180
- Very smart.
- I thought so.

06:58.350 --> 06:59.980
Do you see that?

07:00.480 --> 07:04.009
This is my husband's old fishing
box. I put this little latch on it

07:04.010 --> 07:07.009
and then when I open it,
the stopper holds it

07:07.010 --> 07:09.879
and creates more counter space.

07:09.880 --> 07:12.157
And then I keep my
really nice stuff inside.

07:12.181 --> 07:14.079
My dishes that my dad gave me,

07:14.080 --> 07:17.086
he collected these, Linda
May, from yard sales.

07:17.110 --> 07:20.850
And when I graduated from high school
he gave me the whole set.

07:21.017 --> 07:23.149
- They are beautiful.
- Isn't that great?

07:23.150 --> 07:25.350
Yeah, it's called autumn leaf.

07:25.450 --> 07:27.786
I don’t have that many pieces with me,
but you know...

07:27.810 --> 07:29.980
What did you name your van?

07:30.530 --> 07:32.141
"Vanguard".

07:32.165 --> 07:34.440
Ah, that is very strong.

07:34.464 --> 07:36.189
She is.

07:52.750 --> 07:54.953
Hey, what are you doing?

08:00.680 --> 08:05.309
<i>The bears held at the polar bear
holding facility are troublemakers</i>

08:05.310 --> 08:08.209
<i>who are kept imprisoned
until they settle down.</i>

08:08.210 --> 08:11.913
<i>Which can take anywhere
from two to thirty days.</i>

08:31.680 --> 08:33.359
Fern?

08:33.610 --> 08:35.448
- Hey, Brandy.
- Hi, Fern.

08:35.450 --> 08:37.856
- Hey, kids.
- Hi.

08:37.880 --> 08:40.626
- How are you?
- I'm good.

08:40.650 --> 08:42.456
It's nice to see you. It's been a while.

08:42.480 --> 08:43.525
How have you been?

08:43.549 --> 08:45.709
- Good. Thanks.
- Good. You look good.

08:45.710 --> 08:47.229
- Cut your hair.
- Yeah, I cut it.

08:47.253 --> 08:48.887
- I like it. I like it a lot.
- Thank you.

08:48.911 --> 08:50.199
Are you working at Amazon again?

08:50.223 --> 08:51.581
- Yeah.
- Do you like it?

08:51.605 --> 08:52.986
Yeah, great money.

08:53.010 --> 08:55.026
Are you still doing the van thing?

08:55.050 --> 08:58.109
Yeah, I'm parked over
at the Desert Rose RV Park.

08:58.110 --> 09:00.198
We just drove by there today.

09:00.222 --> 09:02.109
- Didn't we, girls?
- How's your mom?

09:02.110 --> 09:04.526
She's wonderful, she
misses you a lot.

09:04.550 --> 09:06.711
- Please tell her I miss her too.
- I will. I will.

09:06.735 --> 09:08.632
But really, Fern, if...

09:08.656 --> 09:10.686
If you need a place to stay

09:10.710 --> 09:13.586
you can come over and stay with us,
we're worried about you.

09:13.610 --> 09:15.456
Thanks. Don't worry about me.

09:15.480 --> 09:17.238
I'll let you know, I promise.

09:17.262 --> 09:20.210
- Okay. Bye.
- See you, Aubrey.

09:25.850 --> 09:27.546
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:27.570 --> 09:29.626
You still the smartest kid in school?

09:29.650 --> 09:31.980
Yeah. Kinda.

09:32.110 --> 09:35.906
You remember anything that we worked on
when I tutored you?

09:36.880 --> 09:38.450
Yes.

09:38.550 --> 09:40.828
Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow

09:40.852 --> 09:42.109
and all our yesterdays

09:42.133 --> 09:44.449
have lighted fools the way to dusty death.

09:44.450 --> 09:46.710
Out, out, brief candle!

09:46.810 --> 09:51.250
- That's really good. Thank you.
- Thank you.

09:52.050 --> 09:55.386
My mom says that you're homeless,
is that true?

09:55.410 --> 09:57.411
No, I'm not homeless.

09:57.435 --> 09:59.826
I'm just house-less.

09:59.850 --> 10:02.556
- Not the same thing, right?
- Yeah.

10:02.580 --> 10:04.093
Don't worry about me. I'm okay.

10:04.117 --> 10:05.600
Okay.

10:29.710 --> 10:32.186
Before I moved into this Squeeze inn

10:32.210 --> 10:36.156
I was out looking for work
and putting in applications.

10:36.180 --> 10:39.450
2008, and it was just tough.

10:39.883 --> 10:44.610
I got to a really really low point.

10:46.480 --> 10:48.102
And I thought about suicide.

10:48.126 --> 10:50.676
And I decided I was gonna

10:50.700 --> 10:56.035
go buy a bottle of booze,
turn on the propane stove.

10:56.922 --> 11:00.756
And I was gonna drink that booze
until I'm passed out.

11:00.780 --> 11:02.750
And if I woke up

11:03.558 --> 11:07.310
I was gonna light a cigarette
and I was gonna blow us all up.

11:08.362 --> 11:11.479
And I looked at my two sweet little
trusting dogs.

11:11.480 --> 11:15.151
My Cocker Spaniel
and my little Toy Poodle.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.586
And I,

11:16.610 --> 11:19.356
I just couldn't do that to them.

11:19.380 --> 11:20.723
And I thought.

11:20.747 --> 11:22.256
Well,

11:22.280 --> 11:24.366
I can't do that to me either.

11:24.390 --> 11:29.326
So I was getting close to 62 and

11:29.350 --> 11:32.538
I went online to look at my
social security benefits.

11:32.562 --> 11:36.450
It said $550.

11:37.980 --> 11:40.556
Fern, I have worked my whole life.

11:40.580 --> 11:42.749
I've worked since I was 12 years old.

11:42.750 --> 11:45.650
Raised two daughters,
I couldn't believe it.

11:46.210 --> 11:50.551
So I'm online and I find
Bob Wells’ cheap RV living.

11:50.575 --> 11:54.710
I could live in a RV. Travel.

11:55.780 --> 11:58.349
And not have to work
for the rest of my life.

11:58.350 --> 12:03.756
<i>The RTR is a boot camp
for beginner nomads...</i>

12:03.780 --> 12:06.786
Bob Wells looks just like Santa Claus.

12:06.810 --> 12:09.849
Doesn't he? Everybody says that.

12:09.850 --> 12:11.626
What's RTR stand for?

12:11.650 --> 12:13.926
Rubber Tramp Rendezvous.

12:13.950 --> 12:17.779
It is in Quartzsite, Arizona,
out in the middle of the desert.

12:17.780 --> 12:19.286
On BLM land.

12:19.310 --> 12:21.479
You should come. I'm gonna make you a map.

12:21.480 --> 12:23.410
No, I don't think I'm gonna go.

12:23.680 --> 12:26.794
I hope you come, I'm gonna make you
a map either way.

12:26.818 --> 12:29.286
<i>That's what the RTR is.</i>

12:29.310 --> 12:35.380
<i>It is a support system for people
who need help now.</i>

12:51.350 --> 12:52.926
See you next year, Fern.

12:52.950 --> 12:55.780
- Happy holiday.
- Yeah, you too, Doug.

13:30.125 --> 13:32.686
Carl had a stroke.

13:32.710 --> 13:34.756
- Is he dead?
- No.

13:34.780 --> 13:38.780
His daughter came and took him back East.

13:39.100 --> 13:40.379
But they didn't take the dog?

13:40.380 --> 13:43.871
They couldn't take him.
Would you like to have him?

13:43.895 --> 13:45.269
He's really a good dog.

13:45.293 --> 13:46.801
- He's real friendly.
- No. No.

13:46.825 --> 13:51.255
Okay, so you are leaving
on Thursday, right?

13:51.279 --> 13:53.210
- Yeah.
- Okay.

13:53.280 --> 13:55.921
- I just finished Amazon yesterday.
- Okay.

13:55.945 --> 13:58.771
Amazon pays through Thursday.

13:58.795 --> 14:03.109
And then after that
it's $375 per month.

14:03.110 --> 14:06.326
Is there a discount
if I don't use the electrical dump?

14:06.350 --> 14:07.879
Because I just have my van you know.

14:07.880 --> 14:09.949
No, but since you're in the van

14:09.950 --> 14:11.649
it's easy for you to move

14:11.650 --> 14:13.881
and to go South to a warmer place.

14:13.905 --> 14:16.726
Yeah, but I wanted to get a job
around here first.

14:16.750 --> 14:18.680
Good luck with that.

14:19.019 --> 14:20.950
That's tough.

14:21.580 --> 14:22.723
- Bye, Patty.
- Bye, Fern.

14:22.747 --> 14:25.350
Will see you next year.

14:47.610 --> 14:51.279
My husband worked at the USG Mine
and Empire.

14:51.280 --> 14:54.049
And I worked in human resources
there for a few years.

14:54.050 --> 14:56.809
That was my last full-time job.
I did a lot of part-time jobs.

14:56.810 --> 14:58.572
The cashier at the Empire's store.

14:58.596 --> 15:01.161
I was a substitute teacher
at the school for five years.

15:01.186 --> 15:02.750
Didn't the Empire
mine shut down,

15:02.774 --> 15:05.421
and then all of the resident
workers had to relocate?

15:05.445 --> 15:07.051
Yeah, about a year ago.

15:07.075 --> 15:10.750
Wow. So when do you
need to get back to work?

15:11.028 --> 15:12.575
Now?

15:13.080 --> 15:15.656
It is a tough time right now.

15:15.680 --> 15:19.362
You may wanna consider
registering for early retirement.

15:19.386 --> 15:22.892
I don't think I can get
by on the benefits and...

15:26.250 --> 15:27.481
I need work.

15:27.505 --> 15:29.210
I like work.

15:29.750 --> 15:33.750
I'm not sure exactly
what you would be eligible for.

15:40.321 --> 15:42.111
- Hey!
- Hi.

15:42.135 --> 15:44.779
I'm Rachel. I'm the
manager here at Pop's Peak.

15:44.780 --> 15:47.110
- Hi, I'm Fern.
- Hi, Fern.

15:48.838 --> 15:51.786
I asked someone, they said
I can park here overnight.

15:51.810 --> 15:53.686
You're fine, you're more than welcome.

15:53.710 --> 15:56.249
But you know, the temperature gonna drop

15:56.250 --> 15:58.231
it gets really cold here at night.

15:58.255 --> 16:00.924
- Really cold.
- I can tell.

16:00.948 --> 16:05.586
I don't wanna overstep my bounds here,
there's a church down

16:05.610 --> 16:07.809
by 7/11. It's a Baptist church.

16:07.810 --> 16:09.879
And they do have open beds.

16:09.880 --> 16:13.301
- I'm gonna be good.
- Okay. Okay.

16:13.325 --> 16:16.480
- We're here if you need anything.
- Thank you.

18:19.010 --> 18:20.950
I'm so glad you came.

18:21.610 --> 18:25.703
- That's Bob Wells.
- You can sit here. Keep the chair.

18:28.150 --> 18:30.973
And the odd thing
is that we not only

18:30.997 --> 18:34.686
accept the tyranny of the dollar,
the tyranny of the marketplace.

18:34.710 --> 18:41.186
We embrace it. We gladly throw the yoke
of the tyranny of the dollar on

18:41.210 --> 18:43.956
and live by it our whole lives.

18:43.980 --> 18:46.886
I think of an analogy
as a work horse.

18:46.910 --> 18:50.526
The work horse that is
willing to work itself to death.

18:50.550 --> 18:52.426
And then be put out to pasture.

18:52.450 --> 18:54.709
And that's what happens to so many of us.

18:54.710 --> 18:56.609
If society was throwing us away

18:56.610 --> 18:59.081
and sending us as the work horse
out to the pasture.

18:59.105 --> 19:02.226
We, work horses have to gather together
and take care of each other.

19:02.250 --> 19:04.681
And that's what this is all about.

19:04.705 --> 19:07.086
The way I see it is the Titanic is sinking

19:07.110 --> 19:09.681
and economic times are changing.

19:09.705 --> 19:13.479
And, so my goal is to get the lifeboats out

19:13.480 --> 19:16.550
and get as many people
into the lifeboats as I can.

19:21.710 --> 19:24.011
- What's that?
- This is vegan.

19:24.035 --> 19:27.091
No, I'm a carnivore.

19:27.115 --> 19:29.286
Okay, thank you
though. Looks good.

19:29.310 --> 19:31.980
- Another carnivore? She's carnivore.
- Okay.

19:34.680 --> 19:36.456
You good? More?

19:36.480 --> 19:38.686
Oh, she likes the red pepper.

19:38.710 --> 19:41.450
- Cilantro?
- No.

19:49.280 --> 19:51.250
I'm a Vietnam vet.

19:52.250 --> 19:54.350
I got PTSD.

19:54.410 --> 19:57.521
I really can't handle loud noises.

19:57.545 --> 20:01.810
Big crowds. Fireworks.

20:01.880 --> 20:04.956
I got a pickup truck and a camper.

20:04.980 --> 20:06.780
I can live out here.

20:08.510 --> 20:10.380
Be at peace.

20:12.780 --> 20:18.134
I had finally convinced my grandpa,
and my papa, and my mama

20:18.158 --> 20:23.799
that we should take off an RV
and see the country.

20:23.823 --> 20:27.956
But then both of them were told
that they had cancer.

20:27.980 --> 20:30.526
They passed away three weeks apart.

20:30.550 --> 20:36.480
I began watching Bob
Wells' videos on van dwelling.

20:36.980 --> 20:39.856
Then I bought my van, PAINT.

20:39.880 --> 20:42.780
Because she takes me where I ain't.

20:43.080 --> 20:48.448
And started my healing journey
two and a half years ago.

20:48.472 --> 20:52.526
Um, I worked for corporate
America, you know, for 20 years.

20:52.550 --> 20:55.956
My friend Bill worked for the same company.

20:55.980 --> 20:57.726
And...

20:57.750 --> 20:59.686
He had liver failure.

20:59.710 --> 21:02.226
A week before he was due to retire.

21:02.250 --> 21:05.332
HR called him in hospice

21:05.356 --> 21:10.110
and said, you know, let's
talk about your retirement.

21:10.650 --> 21:12.785
He died 10 days later.

21:12.809 --> 21:15.520
Having never been
able to take that sailboat

21:15.544 --> 21:19.998
that he bought
out of his driveway.

21:20.022 --> 21:23.280
And he missed out on everything.

21:23.978 --> 21:25.709
Then he told me before he died,

21:25.710 --> 21:27.779
just don't waste any time, girl.

21:27.780 --> 21:29.426
Don't waste any time.

21:29.450 --> 21:31.786
So I retired as soon as I could.

21:31.810 --> 21:35.780
I didn't want my sailboat to be
in the driveway when I died.

21:36.810 --> 21:39.810
So... yeah.

21:40.180 --> 21:41.986
And it's not.

21:42.010 --> 21:44.580
My sailboat is out here in the desert.

21:53.610 --> 21:56.850
I can't imagine what you're going through.

21:57.750 --> 22:01.263
Loss of your husband and
the loss of your whole town

22:01.287 --> 22:04.210
and friends, and village and...

22:04.302 --> 22:08.026
That kind of a loss is never easy.

22:08.050 --> 22:12.286
And... I wish I had an
easy answer for you. But,

22:12.310 --> 22:15.179
I think you've come to the right place
to find an answer.

22:15.180 --> 22:16.980
I think that…

22:17.084 --> 22:19.922
I think connecting to nature and

22:19.946 --> 22:22.886
to the real true community and tribe will

22:22.910 --> 22:25.186
make all the difference for you.

22:25.210 --> 22:26.710
I hope so.

22:51.880 --> 22:54.486
- Hey, Fern.
- Hey, Linda.

22:54.510 --> 22:55.949
Come over and join us.

22:55.950 --> 22:57.786
No, I just good, talking a walk.

22:57.810 --> 23:00.250
- Okay.
- Be back soon.

24:03.210 --> 24:06.550
- Hey.
- Hey. Good morning.

24:28.250 --> 24:31.049
The only question I get all the
time is Bob, I have to live in the city

24:31.050 --> 24:32.843
I'd like to be out here but I can't.

24:32.867 --> 24:36.486
How can I avoid the famous
knock on the door?

24:36.510 --> 24:40.880
So I've developed what I call
the 10 commandments of stealth parking.

24:48.672 --> 24:50.078
And then in and out. Just...

24:50.110 --> 24:53.180
You gotta make the hole bigger.

24:53.697 --> 24:56.950
There you go. Yeah,
that's it. That's perfect.

24:58.150 --> 25:00.410
Then you gotta...

25:02.510 --> 25:03.949
I love this lifestyle.

25:03.950 --> 25:07.986
It is a lifestyle of freedom, and beauty,
and connection to the earth.

25:08.010 --> 25:10.756
Yet there is a tradeoff.

25:10.780 --> 25:14.180
You gotta learn how to take care
of your own shit.

25:14.710 --> 25:18.580
Most of us in this lifestyle
use the five-gallon bucket.

25:18.880 --> 25:23.056
Most of us are in vans.
Or something larger.

25:23.080 --> 25:24.980
I'm in a Prius.

25:25.580 --> 25:27.656
So I use a two gallon bucket.

25:27.680 --> 25:30.750
If you have bad knees,
you can use a seven-gallon bucket.

25:33.350 --> 25:35.314
- Hi, Fern.
- Hi, guys.

25:39.776 --> 25:42.750
- I got these for you.
- Thank you.

25:47.603 --> 25:50.010
You should take this one.

25:50.080 --> 25:51.830
That's one is kinda funky.

25:51.854 --> 25:54.481
- Oh, these are yours?
- Yeah.

25:54.505 --> 25:57.709
There's a black hole in every van,
especially in mine.

25:57.710 --> 26:00.156
One time I had seven of these can openers.

26:00.180 --> 26:01.926
Doesn't happen to me.

26:01.950 --> 26:04.849
Trade you for a pot holder, I make them.

26:04.850 --> 26:06.049
Okay, sure. Wow.

26:06.050 --> 26:07.386
What is this, crocheted?

26:07.410 --> 26:09.480
No, something different.

26:11.350 --> 26:13.150
That is nice.

26:13.850 --> 26:16.250
- It's going out with me.
- Okay.

26:16.650 --> 26:19.650
- See ya.
- Bye.

26:30.350 --> 26:32.726
Seems like the work
it's not gonna be...

26:32.750 --> 26:34.646
Oh, it's sliding.

26:34.670 --> 26:36.880
Do you take resumes?

26:38.150 --> 26:40.109
I'll leave it with you just in case.

26:40.110 --> 26:42.579
- No, just go...
- Go online?

26:42.580 --> 26:43.649
- Yeah.
- Okay.

26:43.650 --> 26:45.786
I got a four pack for a hundred.

26:45.810 --> 26:47.645
Just like that.

26:49.110 --> 26:51.279
- Did you feel it?
- That's what it does to people.

26:51.280 --> 26:53.380
- It scared me.
- It scares them away.

26:53.587 --> 26:55.986
You guys know,
how much money is sitting here?

26:56.010 --> 26:58.810
It's like they are dinosaurs.

27:01.426 --> 27:04.926
Watch out. Watch
out. Watch the steps.

27:04.950 --> 27:06.880
<i>Welcome aboard.</i>

27:07.610 --> 27:09.286
It's like a disco.

27:09.310 --> 27:11.010
Oh my Gosh.

27:13.010 --> 27:14.826
The lighting is beautiful.

27:14.850 --> 27:17.826
- Washer and dryer.
- Oh my god!

27:17.850 --> 27:19.510
You're kidding.

27:21.110 --> 27:22.981
Ladies, where are we going?

27:23.005 --> 27:24.085
Hawaii.

27:24.109 --> 27:25.756
- No.
- Well, yeah, well.

27:25.780 --> 27:27.886
There's water between here and there.

27:27.910 --> 27:29.956
Let's not go to the East Coast.

27:29.980 --> 27:33.756
There's no place big enough over there
to park something this size.

27:33.780 --> 27:36.810
This is the magic bus. We can go to Hawaii.

27:38.564 --> 27:41.167
♪ On our vans again ♪

27:41.750 --> 27:46.210
♪ Goin' places that we've never been ♪

27:46.410 --> 27:51.409
♪ Goin' places we may never go again. ♪

27:51.410 --> 27:55.910

28:05.280 --> 28:07.426
All right, in the Quartzsite, Arizona

28:07.450 --> 28:09.338
especially in the
Quartzsite Yacht Club where

28:09.362 --> 28:12.880
line dancing is the long
standing tradition. So here we go.

28:42.242 --> 28:43.367
Looks like you gotta

28:47.080 --> 28:48.642
No.

28:48.980 --> 28:50.705
You sure?

28:50.780 --> 28:53.880
- Okay.
- All right.

29:41.985 --> 29:44.610
Goodbye, Fern.

30:22.250 --> 30:24.010
Nice.

30:26.734 --> 30:30.156
<i>For your security while on
the road or out in the Bunyard.</i>

30:30.180 --> 30:32.361
<i>Any questions you may have</i>

30:32.385 --> 30:37.356

maintenance and troubleshooting.</i>

30:37.380 --> 30:40.226
<i>Stop on by today, and bring your rig.</i>

30:40.250 --> 30:45.080
<i>So we can help you take advantage
of what mother nature is offering for free.</i>

31:23.478 --> 31:26.410
Hey, Ron, can you come here for a second?

31:26.650 --> 31:29.110
This guy has some really nice stuff.

31:29.780 --> 31:31.256
This is Nudo, Roxy. It's Ron.

31:31.280 --> 31:32.479
How is it goin', Ron?

31:32.480 --> 31:34.109
- Roxy.
- Trying to make some gas money...

31:34.110 --> 31:35.385
Nice to meet you.

31:35.409 --> 31:38.950
Yeah, I think this is a really nice one.
Look at that work.

31:39.250 --> 31:41.126
It's got nice...

31:41.150 --> 31:44.050
Look. Look, Ron, look.

32:11.210 --> 32:12.750
Hello, ma'am.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.680
Can you by chance have an extra cigarette?

32:15.980 --> 32:17.780
Yeah, sure.

32:18.280 --> 32:19.781
Need a light?

32:19.805 --> 32:21.710
I'll have one.

32:25.080 --> 32:26.426
Need it?

32:26.450 --> 32:28.686
Well, sure. Thank you.

32:28.710 --> 32:30.451
- What's your name?
- Fern.

32:30.475 --> 32:32.224
- Fern, Derek.
- Hi, Derek.

32:32.248 --> 32:34.320
- Well, it's nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

32:34.344 --> 32:36.274
I'll be seeing you.

32:58.780 --> 33:01.209
What? What?

33:01.210 --> 33:04.280
It's Fern, It's Fern, Swankie. It's Fern.

33:06.350 --> 33:07.449
Hey.

33:07.450 --> 33:09.449
- Can't you see the flag?
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

33:09.450 --> 33:11.756
- It means I don't wanna be disturbed.
- I know.

33:11.780 --> 33:13.209
I need a ride to town.

33:13.210 --> 33:14.456
Why?

33:14.480 --> 33:15.996
I blew my tire.

33:16.020 --> 33:17.926
Well, go change it.

33:17.950 --> 33:19.026
I don't have a spare.

33:19.050 --> 33:20.326
You don't have a spare?

33:20.350 --> 33:22.880
You're on the boondocks
and you don't have a spare?

33:27.510 --> 33:29.826
You can die out here.
You are out in the wilderness.

33:29.850 --> 33:31.356
Far away from anybody.

33:31.380 --> 33:33.379
You can die out here,
don't you understand that?

33:33.380 --> 33:36.086
You have to take it seriously.
You have to have a way to get help.

33:36.110 --> 33:37.956
You have to be able to change
your on tires.

33:37.980 --> 33:39.563
I appreciate it, thanks, Swankie.

33:39.587 --> 33:41.156
All right.

33:41.180 --> 33:43.186
You think you can pay me back.

33:43.210 --> 33:45.791
I'm gonna go on this trip,
I'm getting ready to leave.

33:45.815 --> 33:48.536
I got a lot to do, can't get it all done
fast enough. - Sure.

33:48.560 --> 33:50.486
- You can you help me finish things up.
- Yeah.

33:50.510 --> 33:52.156
- I really appreciate it.
- You got it.

33:52.180 --> 33:55.129
Here's what I suggest, don't get AAA, okay.

33:55.153 --> 33:58.126
You gotta get something like a spot device,
a satellite tracking device.

33:58.150 --> 34:01.186
We need to soak the sandpaper.
It's called wet n' dry.

34:01.210 --> 34:03.210
We need it to be wet.

34:07.210 --> 34:09.126
Now we need a mask to fender off

34:09.150 --> 34:11.609
because the white paint
will land on the fender too.

34:11.610 --> 34:13.255
Put plastic over this.

34:13.280 --> 34:14.628
All right, let me just say,

34:14.652 --> 34:16.929
that this is a lot more
complicated than I thought.

34:16.954 --> 34:19.129
- Oh, it's very very complicated.
- Uh-huh.

34:19.152 --> 34:23.409
It has taken me a long time to patch
all the peeling paint on this van.

34:24.179 --> 34:25.849
So, are you quitting on me?

34:25.850 --> 34:27.826
No, I'm not quitting.

34:27.850 --> 34:30.562
When we get done with all of this,
I'm gonna give you all my paint.

34:30.585 --> 34:33.397
I don't wanna take anymore of it with me,
you can have it all. Cause

34:33.420 --> 34:36.409
you know, your van looks kinda...

34:36.650 --> 34:37.726
Ratty.

34:37.750 --> 34:39.480
No, it doesn't.

34:39.850 --> 34:41.909
She does not. She just needs a wash.

34:41.909 --> 34:44.949
No, take my paint.

35:02.410 --> 35:04.210
Ratty.

35:57.080 --> 35:59.649
Fern, it's Swankie.

35:59.650 --> 36:01.621
What? I'm indisposed.

36:01.645 --> 36:03.330
Where did I get all this stuff?

36:03.354 --> 36:05.495
- Yeah, well, it adds up.
- Where did it come from?

36:05.519 --> 36:08.849
I just put on Facebook
Quartzsite chatter the other day

36:08.850 --> 36:11.956
that I was giving all this stuff away
and asked people to come and get it.

36:11.980 --> 36:13.950
So I'm hoping they do.

36:14.450 --> 36:16.826
- Love this.
- Take it.

36:16.850 --> 36:18.756
- Are you kidding?
- It's yours.

36:18.780 --> 36:20.249
Wow, that's nice.

36:20.250 --> 36:22.272
You look really good in that chair.

36:22.296 --> 36:25.256
That's called red, white and blue jasper.

36:25.280 --> 36:28.556
- What's that?
- That's petrified palm wood.

36:28.580 --> 36:33.680
And that's part of the same rock.

36:34.510 --> 36:36.050
Ouch.

36:36.950 --> 36:38.818
- Careful with your arms.
- That's another one of the

36:38.842 --> 36:40.231
red, white and blue...

36:40.255 --> 36:42.083
and...

36:42.110 --> 36:43.286
- What's going on?
- What?

36:43.310 --> 36:46.010
I don't feel very good.

36:47.180 --> 36:49.750
Here, sit down.

36:52.480 --> 36:54.011
Got it?

36:55.850 --> 36:57.909
What's going on? What do you need?

36:57.910 --> 37:00.710
My head hurts really really bad
and I'm nauseated.

37:00.810 --> 37:03.550
- Water will help?
- Oh yeah.

37:08.980 --> 37:10.750
Careful with your arm.

37:25.280 --> 37:26.980
You all right?

37:27.780 --> 37:30.950
I... I guess I'm all right.

37:41.080 --> 37:42.923
Are you okay?

37:46.250 --> 37:48.011
Doctors told me that,

37:48.035 --> 37:52.586
well, I had cancer removed
from my lung a while back and

37:52.610 --> 37:55.380
small cell carcinoma.

37:56.050 --> 37:58.671
They told me it's spread to my brain and

37:58.695 --> 38:02.350
they've only given me
seven or eight months to live.

38:02.850 --> 38:06.286
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

38:06.310 --> 38:11.279
I'm gonna take my trip.
Gonna go back to Alaska again

38:11.280 --> 38:13.162
because of some good memories.

38:13.186 --> 38:15.099
And, um...

38:15.283 --> 38:17.586
Just do what I have to do.

38:17.610 --> 38:21.149
I have this book called "Final Exit"
by Dr. Kevorkian. They call him...

38:21.150 --> 38:23.426
Some people call him "Doctor Death".

38:23.450 --> 38:29.080
And it's like various ways
that you can end your life if you need to.

38:29.550 --> 38:31.680
It's kinda like a recipe.

38:31.780 --> 38:35.149
I have it if I have to fall back on it
for some ideas.

38:35.150 --> 38:39.850
But I'm not gonna spend anymore time
indoors in a hospital.

38:40.310 --> 38:41.910
No thanks.

38:47.080 --> 38:49.610
I'm gonna be 75 this year.

38:49.780 --> 38:51.626
I think I've lived a pretty good life.

38:51.650 --> 38:55.681
I've seen some really neat things
kayaking all of those places.

38:55.705 --> 38:56.708
And...

38:56.732 --> 38:59.310
You know, like a
moose in the wild.

38:59.334 --> 39:03.309
A moose family on
the river in Idaho and

39:04.780 --> 39:10.551
big white pelicans landed just six feet
over my kayak on a lake in Colorado.

39:10.575 --> 39:12.641
Or...

39:13.580 --> 39:16.721
Come around a bin, was a cliff

39:16.745 --> 39:20.879
and find hundreds and hundreds
of swallow nests on the wall of the cliff.

39:20.880 --> 39:23.426
And the swallows flying all around.

39:23.450 --> 39:25.486
And reflecting in the water.

39:25.510 --> 39:27.709
So it looks like I'm flying
with the swallows

39:27.710 --> 39:30.451
and they're under me,
and over me, and all around me.

39:30.475 --> 39:32.679
And little babies are hatching out,

39:32.680 --> 39:35.309
and eggshells are falling out of the nest
landing on the water and

39:35.310 --> 39:36.556
floating on the water.

39:36.580 --> 39:37.986
These little white shells.

39:38.010 --> 39:40.049
That was like, it's just so awesome.

39:40.050 --> 39:43.009
I felt like I've done enough.
My life was complete.

39:43.010 --> 39:45.349
If I died right then, at that moment,

39:45.350 --> 39:47.650
would be perfectly fine.

40:06.180 --> 40:08.086
I don't know.
Maybe when I die

40:08.110 --> 40:10.356
my friends will gather around the fire

40:10.380 --> 40:13.976
and toss a rock into the fire
in the memory of me.

40:19.750 --> 40:23.010
Oh I just want to
see something new.

40:35.750 --> 40:38.617
And then pull it up, close that.

40:38.641 --> 40:43.041
- How about that?
- Oh. Look at this.

40:51.380 --> 40:54.486
My grandmother made that for me,
and gave it to me. So...

40:54.510 --> 40:55.956
Enjoy, take good care of it.

40:55.980 --> 40:58.380
- Thank you.
- Bye.

42:11.085 --> 42:12.204
What?

42:12.228 --> 42:15.226
I've been thinking a lot
about my husband, Bo.

42:15.250 --> 42:16.803
When it got really
bad at the end

42:16.827 --> 42:19.586
they had him in the
hospital on morphine drippin'.

42:19.610 --> 42:22.310
I was sitting there at night
in the hospital.

42:23.719 --> 42:25.344
And...

42:26.310 --> 42:31.210
I'd wanna put my thumb down on that
morphine drip just a little bit longer.

42:32.310 --> 42:35.310
So I could let him go.

42:35.650 --> 42:39.150
Maybe I should've tried harder.

42:39.680 --> 42:43.750
So he could've gone sooner
without all that pain.

42:44.780 --> 42:46.681
Maybe he wouldn't have wanted that.

42:46.705 --> 42:50.050
Maybe he was trying to stay with you
as long as he could.

42:50.710 --> 42:53.410
I'm sure you took good care of him, Fern.

42:55.450 --> 42:57.080
I did.

43:02.950 --> 43:04.650
Goodbye, Fern.

43:41.210 --> 43:42.910
How about a drink?

43:43.950 --> 43:47.550
How about a toast to our friends?

43:47.780 --> 43:51.281
Not the friends you
gonna see every day. No.

43:51.305 --> 43:55.946
Instead we're gonna drink to the friends
who had to go away.

43:55.970 --> 43:58.586
I bet you know just who I mean.

46:30.742 --> 46:32.790
- Hey, how are you doing?
- Thank you very much.

46:32.814 --> 46:34.009
Yeah, sure.

46:34.010 --> 46:36.410
- This is black. So...
- It's good.

46:38.380 --> 46:40.680
Hello, coffee?

46:45.910 --> 46:47.281
- I know you.
- Yeah, hi.

46:47.305 --> 46:49.556
Dave, right? Guess.

46:49.580 --> 46:51.256
- Fern?
- Yes.

46:51.280 --> 46:53.126
I have your can opener.

46:53.150 --> 46:56.926
Yeah, you do. Are you working here now?

46:56.950 --> 46:58.580
Yeah, first year.

46:59.180 --> 47:00.710
So coffee?

47:01.650 --> 47:03.310
Yeah, sure.

47:09.918 --> 47:11.324
Black, go.

47:11.348 --> 47:13.415
If you want anything
you can put it in.

47:13.439 --> 47:15.109
- So, see ya.
- Yeah. Have a good day.

47:15.110 --> 47:16.290
I'm your camp post.

47:16.314 --> 47:20.479
One thing you wanna make sure
that you always do is put on gloves.

47:20.480 --> 47:21.949
You need to protect your health.

47:21.950 --> 47:24.751
We have people from all over the world
coming here.

47:24.775 --> 47:26.792
Give 'em a little puff.

47:37.010 --> 47:39.649
Walls too? Or just
that silver thing?

47:39.650 --> 47:41.950
Oh. Walls too. Yes.

47:42.048 --> 47:45.296
Where do you go and
find scenery like this?

47:45.320 --> 47:49.880
Right here is we'll go,
The badlands.

47:50.550 --> 47:53.310
We'd be the bitches of the badlands.

48:13.747 --> 48:14.886
Some people!

48:14.910 --> 48:16.949
Oh. That's almost a whole bag of burrito.

48:16.950 --> 48:20.310
- Excuse me.
- Yeah. Hey.

48:20.334 --> 48:22.009
Are you the camp post?

48:22.010 --> 48:23.965
Yes, I’m Fern, that’s Linda May.

48:23.989 --> 48:25.026
How are you guys doing?

48:25.050 --> 48:26.849
- Good.
- Hello, I'd shake your hand

48:26.850 --> 48:28.749
- but not now.
- You don't wanna touch this.

48:28.750 --> 48:30.269
The power is out here.

48:30.293 --> 48:33.110
We're trying to have our
daughter's birthday party.

48:34.550 --> 48:36.108
- Is it on?
- It's on.

48:36.132 --> 48:37.156
All right.

48:37.180 --> 48:40.081
Do you want me to tie this one
on your wrist too?

48:40.105 --> 48:42.249
Taking off.

48:44.280 --> 48:46.380
Which hand do you want it on?

48:46.410 --> 48:48.094
That one?

48:50.039 --> 48:52.086
Here you go.

48:52.110 --> 48:54.526
Welcome to Badland Spa.

48:54.550 --> 48:58.426
Can I please have a volunteer
from the audience?

48:58.450 --> 49:00.465
- Take me.
- Okay.

49:03.543 --> 49:06.426
Oh, doesn't that feel wonderful?

49:06.450 --> 49:07.686
What's your name, miss?

49:07.710 --> 49:10.010
- Linda.
- Linda.

49:19.250 --> 49:20.786
Hi, may I help you?

49:20.810 --> 49:22.526
Yes, we're here for the tour.

49:22.550 --> 49:24.726
The tour will be in about 15 minutes.

49:24.750 --> 49:26.056
Should we wait right here?

49:26.080 --> 49:29.407
You can wait if you want here. I have
got a great map of the local area here.

49:29.431 --> 49:32.156
We have a schedule of some
of the summer activities right here.

49:32.180 --> 49:34.587
You can take one with you if you like.

49:37.910 --> 49:40.107
- Here you go.
- Okay.

49:40.131 --> 49:42.010
This is gonna be really exciting.

49:42.310 --> 49:44.450
Rub two stones together.

49:44.850 --> 49:48.626
And you see what happens
as they start to get like sand.

49:48.650 --> 49:51.422
That's why it's so easy for

49:51.446 --> 49:53.736
paleontologists to
find fossils in here.

49:53.760 --> 49:55.179
Why are there holes in the rocks?

49:55.180 --> 49:57.526
Not bad. That's a
very good question.

49:57.550 --> 50:00.586
At one time there was air
inside these rocks.

50:00.610 --> 50:03.750
Like a little pockets,
little bubbles of gas.

50:04.160 --> 50:06.381
They were trapped inside the rock.

50:51.278 --> 50:52.864
Hey.

50:53.780 --> 50:56.250
Find anything interesting?

50:56.480 --> 50:58.310
Rocks.

51:17.110 --> 51:20.049
Hey Greg, line that up.

51:20.050 --> 51:22.626
Salute...
To the earth ship.

51:22.650 --> 51:24.486
To the earth ship.

51:24.510 --> 51:28.050
Thank you. Thank you.

51:32.180 --> 51:35.180
It makes your voice go high.

51:38.480 --> 51:41.579
This is, this is my land in Arizona.

51:41.603 --> 51:43.356
I could've built an earth ship.

51:43.380 --> 51:46.526
It's a totally self-contained house.

51:46.550 --> 51:49.626
Built out of tires and bottles and cans

51:49.650 --> 51:53.686
so it has no ways to, it,
in no way harms the land.

51:53.710 --> 51:55.956
- Self-sufficient.
- Self-sufficient.

51:55.980 --> 52:00.486
Looks like a living piece of art, that
you've made with your own two hands.

52:00.510 --> 52:03.726
It's something that I can
leave to my grandchildren.

52:03.750 --> 52:06.826
This house will be there for generations.

52:06.850 --> 52:08.750
Outlive us all.

52:08.780 --> 52:10.410
That's good thing.

52:13.550 --> 52:15.510
There. Now we're on.

52:15.810 --> 52:18.480
When you get old, you get personality.

52:19.710 --> 52:22.450
I am not gonna see you for a while.

52:28.150 --> 52:29.910
You come and see me.

52:30.380 --> 52:32.626
You come and stay as long as you like.

52:32.650 --> 52:34.750
Whenever you like.

52:35.410 --> 52:37.450
- Okay?
- Thank you.

52:37.510 --> 52:39.256
Thank you Linda May.

52:39.280 --> 52:44.010
Oh thank you. You've given me so much.

52:48.210 --> 52:50.580
- OK.
- Great, OK.

53:28.180 --> 53:29.326
Hi Fern.

53:29.350 --> 53:30.850
Hey.

53:31.380 --> 53:33.486
I was at the gas station and

53:33.510 --> 53:35.683
I think it's better if
you don't drive through

53:35.707 --> 53:37.856
the park when it's
dark for your cigarettes

53:37.880 --> 53:38.886
so I got you these.

53:38.910 --> 53:40.086
What are they?

53:40.110 --> 53:41.556
Licorice Sticks.

53:41.580 --> 53:44.126
- I can't smoke licorice sticks.
- I know.

53:44.150 --> 53:48.526
You can chew on these,
they help curb the urge.

53:48.550 --> 53:50.126
I am not gonna quit smoking Dave.

53:50.150 --> 53:52.780
I know, but you...
should try this.

53:52.850 --> 53:55.150
They're good for the digestion too.

53:55.610 --> 53:57.556
Fine, thanks.

53:57.580 --> 53:58.626
What's going on?

53:58.650 --> 54:00.456
Ants, I've got ants.

54:00.480 --> 54:01.926
Oh, ants, they are OK.

54:01.950 --> 54:04.586
No they're not. They are in my food, Dave.

54:04.610 --> 54:06.750
I can do it, thanks.

54:08.750 --> 54:10.310
Where do you want that?

54:14.150 --> 54:15.926
Fern I'm sorry.

54:15.950 --> 54:17.281
I'm sorry, I didn't know that.

54:17.305 --> 54:19.050
Go over there.

54:22.680 --> 54:23.726
You don't have to shout.

54:23.750 --> 54:27.010
- Stay over there.
- OK? I'm going.

55:16.280 --> 55:18.150
No, we're closed.

55:31.580 --> 55:35.426
You are one of those lucky
people that is from the United States.

55:35.450 --> 55:37.186
Of the U S of A.

55:37.210 --> 55:38.786
- Yes.
- Yes I am.

55:38.810 --> 55:41.086
- And you can travel anywhere.
- Yes ma'am, I know.

55:41.110 --> 55:44.386
And they sometimes call you NOMADS,

55:44.410 --> 55:46.926
or people who don't have a home.

55:46.950 --> 55:50.426
I see that you have this ring.

55:50.450 --> 55:52.056
Are you married?

55:52.080 --> 55:56.480
I am but my husband died.

55:57.550 --> 55:59.450
And so…

55:59.810 --> 56:01.256
I'm not gonna take that off.

56:01.280 --> 56:03.586
That ring is a circle

56:03.610 --> 56:05.910
and it never ends.

56:06.210 --> 56:10.380
And that means that
your love never ends.

56:11.150 --> 56:15.350
And you may not be able
to take it off, if you tried.

56:15.480 --> 56:17.780
- I don't think I can.
- No.

56:44.710 --> 56:47.350
It's a nice setup, best one.

57:00.380 --> 57:02.556
He has a case of diverticulitis.

57:02.580 --> 57:05.156
Which is an inflammation
of his intestines. - Uh-huh.

57:05.180 --> 57:07.977
So earlier the surgeon went
and did a laparoscopic surgery.

57:08.001 --> 57:09.491
He had surgery?

57:09.515 --> 57:13.710
- Whoo! Cup noodle.
- Well, it's good for you when you're sick.

57:13.880 --> 57:15.680
Animal crackers.

57:15.774 --> 57:19.210
And for you.

57:21.250 --> 57:23.880
- That's my favourite.
- I know.

57:24.210 --> 57:25.520
Thanks Fern.

57:25.544 --> 57:27.850
So, what are gonna do next?

57:28.950 --> 57:31.710
I'm gonna go to the
beat harvest in Nebraska.

57:32.310 --> 57:33.856
That doesn't start till October.

57:33.880 --> 57:35.380
How about you?

57:35.445 --> 57:37.856
I'm gonna start in Wall Drug.

57:37.880 --> 57:39.026
I did that last year.

57:39.050 --> 57:41.210
I can see if they have another opening.

57:41.780 --> 57:43.656
- For me?
- Yeah.

57:43.680 --> 57:45.810
Got a great place to park.

57:47.617 --> 57:49.780
Enjoy your clippers.

58:06.180 --> 58:08.310
- How you doing?
- I'm doing good.

58:09.380 --> 58:10.880
One...

58:14.980 --> 58:16.355
- Michael,
- Hey, how is it going?

58:16.379 --> 58:18.780
Good, can I take these tomatoes and onions?

58:19.250 --> 58:21.050
Thank you.

58:29.150 --> 58:30.256
I don't like it.

58:30.280 --> 58:32.880
- I'm gonna put it right side of you.
- Okay.

58:33.410 --> 58:36.250
Please don't let her face get near me.

58:37.294 --> 58:39.850
- Oh my gosh.
- Isn't she beautiful?

58:41.510 --> 58:44.080
I'm kinda kidding but I'm not really.

58:44.550 --> 58:47.186
Oh no, it's really squeezing my arm a lot.

58:47.210 --> 58:48.780
That's me.

58:52.010 --> 58:53.780
He didn't get it.

58:53.850 --> 58:56.650
Oh my God, look at how gross it is.

58:56.810 --> 58:59.126
No, no, get out of
there, Jerry, get out!

58:59.150 --> 59:01.810
- Get out!
- Fern, it's fine!

59:02.910 --> 59:05.510
No, what is this? What's he feeding him?

59:05.534 --> 59:09.450
- Oh no, it's rabbit.
- I thought, a chicken.

59:11.250 --> 59:14.310
He wants you, he wants you next.

59:14.680 --> 59:17.126
Get in there, I don’t want to be the one.

59:17.150 --> 59:19.980
It's gonna come right through the glass.

59:43.880 --> 59:45.880
Pack in, pack out.

59:47.210 --> 59:49.550
(Wall store 80-foot dinosaur model)

01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:24.436
Oh, it's right there.

01:00:24.460 --> 01:00:26.686
- Right straight up overhead.
- Uh-huh.

01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:28.850
That's the star Vega.

01:00:29.130 --> 01:00:31.740
But it's 24 light years away.

01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:35.050
So what that means

01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:40.760
that light that you're
looking at left Vega in 1987.

01:00:42.530 --> 01:00:45.350
And it just got here?
- And it just got here.

01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:48.230
So the telescope is set up on Jupiter.

01:00:49.060 --> 01:00:54.380
Jupiter is the largest planet
in our entire solar system.

01:00:54.750 --> 01:00:59.176
Stars blow up and they shoot
plasma and atoms out into space,

01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:01.050
sometimes land on earth

01:01:01.170 --> 01:01:02.940
nourish the soil.

01:01:02.970 --> 01:01:05.520
They become part of you.

01:01:05.660 --> 01:01:08.160
So, fold out your right hand

01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:10.740
and look at the stars.

01:01:11.550 --> 01:01:14.610
Because there are atoms

01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:16.650
from stars that blew up

01:01:16.970 --> 01:01:20.306
eons ago that landed on this planet

01:01:20.330 --> 01:01:22.600
and now they are in your hands.

01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:34.830
Hi, sorry, we are closed.

01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:37.210
I'm looking for Dave.

01:01:37.330 --> 01:01:39.230
I am his son.

01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:42.576
He's in the kitchen right
around the counter there.

01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:44.100
- That one?
- Yeah.

01:02:04.910 --> 01:02:06.560
I've been through here.

01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:09.210
- Oh yeah?
- A couple of times, yeah.

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:11.300
This place man,

01:02:11.347 --> 01:02:14.262
I don't know why anybody
wouldn’t wanna let go.

01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:17.370
Well. I can think of worst places.

01:02:19.582 --> 01:02:21.301
You wanna know a good
way to get to know a place?

01:02:21.325 --> 01:02:22.894
What?

01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:24.886
AA meetings.

01:02:24.910 --> 01:02:26.816
- Really?
- Well, for me.

01:02:27.350 --> 01:02:30.010
Back when I was with the
band I was traveling around

01:02:30.475 --> 01:02:32.346
they just go to AA meetings everywhere.

01:02:32.370 --> 01:02:35.430
It was a great way to get to know
people and get to know a place.

01:02:35.950 --> 01:02:37.450
How is the burger?

01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:41.816
Yeah? He's a good cook, your dad.

01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:43.780
It’s not that hard to make a burger.

01:02:46.324 --> 01:02:47.362
His wife Emily.

01:02:47.386 --> 01:02:50.050
She is cute, hope she's
older than she looks.

01:02:50.672 --> 01:02:52.680
She's gonna have a baby.

01:02:52.820 --> 01:02:54.360
You're gonna be a grandpa.

01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:55.546
When's she due?

01:02:55.570 --> 01:02:59.920
I don't know. Two weeks,
he is on his way home, now.

01:03:00.370 --> 01:03:03.070
- Wants me to come with him.
- You should go.

01:03:11.570 --> 01:03:13.070
I was.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.500
I was.

01:03:18.770 --> 01:03:21.526
He didn't like it very
much that I wasn't around

01:03:21.550 --> 01:03:23.686
when he was... he was young.

01:03:23.710 --> 01:03:26.320
I tried to be around when he was older but.

01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:29.740
But he was into his
thing, and I was into mine.

01:03:31.820 --> 01:03:35.470
I guess I just forgot
how to... be a dad.

01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:39.960
Anyway, I wasn't very good at it.

01:03:41.370 --> 01:03:45.460
Don't think about it too much,
Dave, just go, be a grandfather.

01:03:58.130 --> 01:03:59.750
Do you want to come with me?

01:04:03.450 --> 01:04:05.490
Maybe I can visit sometime.

01:04:06.930 --> 01:04:08.430
Great.

01:04:09.930 --> 01:04:11.416
Bye.

01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:12.940
Good night.

01:05:02.110 --> 01:05:06.550
<i>If you come to visit,
there's plenty more of these!</i>

01:07:48.739 --> 01:07:50.614
You made it, Swankie.

01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:30.201
I'm gonna get the Big
G right here for Georgia.

01:08:30.225 --> 01:08:32.225
And the big bulldog right here

01:08:32.250 --> 01:08:35.359
It will be a full wrist
for the Georgia Bulldogs.

01:09:14.220 --> 01:09:15.720
Oh Jesus!

01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:22.470
Overnight parking, you can't sleep here.

01:09:22.569 --> 01:09:25.100
I'm leaving, I'm leaving.

01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:56.676
OK. Uh, what we've got is

01:09:56.700 --> 01:10:00.406
parts and labor, $2300 and tax.

01:10:00.430 --> 01:10:03.236
I just looked up the value on your VIN.

01:10:03.260 --> 01:10:07.876
With that high mileage, you're looking
about five thousand dollars at the most.

01:10:07.900 --> 01:10:10.200
I would probably recommend

01:10:11.060 --> 01:10:13.776
taking that money and putting
it towards a different vehicle such as

01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:15.806
Yeah, no, well, I can't do that.

01:10:15.830 --> 01:10:18.600
I can't do that, see, cause, alright...

01:10:19.230 --> 01:10:24.032
I spent a lot of time and
money building the inside out and

01:10:24.056 --> 01:10:26.903
lot of people don't
understand the value of

01:10:26.927 --> 01:10:29.630
that but um, it's not
something like you can.

01:10:33.997 --> 01:10:36.036
I live in there.

01:10:36.550 --> 01:10:38.180
It's my home.

01:10:38.660 --> 01:10:41.376
Why can't you just wire to me?

01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:44.906
I can pay you back, Dolly,
listen, I can pay you back.

01:10:44.930 --> 01:10:48.776
I'm gonna do Amazon again
soon, I will be able to pay you back.

01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:51.860
As soon as I get that
check it's gonna be...

01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:59.412
Yeah, I'm being stubborn?
Well, I think you're being a bitch.

01:11:43.100 --> 01:11:44.176
Hi.

01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:45.760
Hi Fern.

01:11:45.819 --> 01:11:47.236
That doorbell works.

01:11:47.260 --> 01:11:51.020
Yeah, well, I didn't hear it so... Hey!

01:11:55.025 --> 01:11:57.546
- I got my famous four-egg cake.
- Alright.

01:11:57.570 --> 01:11:59.026
Dolly cutting it to everyone of you.

01:11:59.050 --> 01:12:02.280
- Okay. Put it there.
- Here? Okay.

01:12:02.940 --> 01:12:06.186
Ooh, that's looks
good. I want that one.

01:12:06.210 --> 01:12:08.220
Alright, that's yours.
I'll put your name on it.

01:12:08.244 --> 01:12:09.350
Double cheese.

01:12:09.374 --> 01:12:11.580
- Please.
- You want cheese?

01:12:11.604 --> 01:12:14.072
I want two slices, please.

01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:18.620
This is my sister Fern.

01:12:18.650 --> 01:12:20.043
- Fern.
- Fern, I'm Jim.

01:12:20.067 --> 01:12:22.499
I am on my hands - Nice to
meet you. this is my wife Pam.

01:12:22.523 --> 01:12:23.944
- Hi Pam. Wet hand.
- Hi.

01:12:23.968 --> 01:12:26.499
Jim has been working
with George for a long time.

01:12:26.523 --> 01:12:29.526
Yeah, George actually sold us our
first house, before I got in real estates.

01:12:29.550 --> 01:12:31.081
Did they tell you how they met?

01:12:31.105 --> 01:12:32.096
No.

01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:35.346
I introduced them, I
introduced you to George

01:12:35.370 --> 01:12:36.671
but I knew George before.

01:12:36.695 --> 01:12:39.455
So I took her out and I said listen.

01:12:41.220 --> 01:12:43.346
George is a really good friend of mine.

01:12:43.370 --> 01:12:45.450
I don't want you to mess this up.

01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:47.670
If you are not serious about him

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.046
don't mess with him.

01:12:50.070 --> 01:12:53.620
- And I didn't mess it up.
- And you said, what are you talking about?

01:12:53.900 --> 01:12:56.400
And, so how many years
have you been together?

01:12:57.350 --> 01:12:58.351
Thirty plus.

01:12:58.375 --> 01:13:00.376
- Worked out pretty good.
- Yeah, worked out pretty good.

01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:04.396
I was able to take care of that
on my own actually after that introduction.

01:13:04.420 --> 01:13:06.676
-You're welcome - Things
are looking good right now,

01:13:06.700 --> 01:13:09.824
the prices are going up,
you know, 2012, from winter.

01:13:09.848 --> 01:13:10.877
- Yeah.
- I mean

01:13:10.901 --> 01:13:14.850
I wish we would have the money in 2008
to buy everything so I could sell it now.

01:13:15.220 --> 01:13:17.760
Seems like real estate
always ends up on the upside.

01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:21.770
I don't want to disagree
with you but I have to say I do.

01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:26.826
It's strange, that you encourage people

01:13:26.850 --> 01:13:29.020
to invest their whole life savings

01:13:29.220 --> 01:13:30.596
go into debt

01:13:30.620 --> 01:13:32.950
just to buy an house they can't afford.

01:13:33.970 --> 01:13:35.470
Fern that's

01:13:35.700 --> 01:13:37.600
rather limited look

01:13:37.970 --> 01:13:40.026
- on what we do.
- Is it limited George?

01:13:40.050 --> 01:13:42.760
We're not all in a position to just

01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:44.846
chuck everything and hit the road.

01:13:44.870 --> 01:13:46.546
Oh, you think, that's what I've done?

01:13:46.570 --> 01:13:49.096
George, I chucked
everything to hit the road?

01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:51.920
- Is that what I did?
- Alright, I'm sorry.

01:13:56.523 --> 01:13:59.196
You know, I think that, um...

01:13:59.220 --> 01:14:03.579
what the nomads are doing is not
that different than what the pioneers did.

01:14:03.900 --> 01:14:06.420
I think Fern's part of
an American tradition.

01:14:06.850 --> 01:14:08.789
I think it's great.

01:14:13.970 --> 01:14:15.470
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:14:20.020 --> 01:14:21.520
Here you go.

01:14:22.850 --> 01:14:25.120
Okay, yeah, thanks.

01:14:25.770 --> 01:14:28.613
- You know, I'll pay you back, right.
- Uh huh.

01:14:28.950 --> 01:14:30.550
- I will.
- Uh huh.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.876
- Why don't you move in with us?
- I can't live here.

01:14:35.900 --> 01:14:39.350
I can't live in this room,
I can't sleep in this bed.

01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:40.576
Thank you but I can't.

01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:43.000
I know we are not as interesting
as the people you meet out there.

01:14:43.024 --> 01:14:44.200
That's not what
I'm talking about.

01:14:44.224 --> 01:14:45.450
No, that's what it is.

01:14:45.474 --> 01:14:49.669
It's always what's out
there that's more interesting.

01:14:49.981 --> 01:14:52.310
You left home as soon as you could.

01:14:52.334 --> 01:14:55.600
You married Bo after just
knowing him a few month.

01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:58.746
And then you moved in the
middle of nowhere with him.

01:14:58.770 --> 01:15:01.270
And then even after Bo passed away

01:15:02.100 --> 01:15:04.726
you still stayed in Empire.

01:15:04.750 --> 01:15:08.800
-I just didn't get it, I mean,
you could have left. .-Yeah.

01:15:11.907 --> 01:15:15.050
See, that's why I can't come here.

01:15:18.332 --> 01:15:21.450
I never said this to you
before, maybe I should have.

01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:24.376
You know, when you
were growing up, you were

01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:27.726
eccentric to other people,
you maybe seemed weird

01:15:27.750 --> 01:15:30.520
but it was just because you were braver

01:15:30.650 --> 01:15:32.950
and more honest than everybody else.

01:15:35.100 --> 01:15:39.670
And you could see me when
I was hiding from everybody.

01:15:40.670 --> 01:15:44.470
And sometimes she could see
me before I could saw myself.

01:15:48.870 --> 01:15:50.820
I needed that in my life.

01:15:51.670 --> 01:15:53.200
And you are my sister.

01:15:53.900 --> 01:15:57.070
I would have loved having
you around all these years.

01:15:59.029 --> 01:16:02.291
You left a big hole by leaving.

01:16:08.670 --> 01:16:10.370
That one's on me.

01:17:15.500 --> 01:17:17.000
Hey.

01:17:17.270 --> 01:17:19.770
Hi, want a sandwich, you hungry?

01:17:20.100 --> 01:17:22.100
I think I've met you before.

01:17:22.850 --> 01:17:26.496
Yeah, I’m Fern. I was
working at T Rock in Quartzsite.

01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:27.946
- Fern.
- Uh hmm.

01:17:27.970 --> 01:17:30.196
You let Noodle sell his
rocks there, didn't you?

01:17:30.220 --> 01:17:31.326
Yeah.

01:17:31.350 --> 01:17:32.850
Would you like a beer?

01:17:34.300 --> 01:17:36.746
Yeah, OK, I'll trade you for a sandwich.

01:17:36.770 --> 01:17:38.820
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

01:17:38.970 --> 01:17:41.101
It's cold, you know, you
should sit down by the fire.

01:17:41.125 --> 01:17:43.485
I got a little trouble from
my knees, can you help me?

01:17:43.509 --> 01:17:45.009
Of course.

01:17:45.770 --> 01:17:47.426
Yeah, I'll do it. Yeah.

01:17:47.450 --> 01:17:49.350
- Alright.
- Thanks.

01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:52.846
You gave me a light, back in Quartzsite.

01:17:52.870 --> 01:17:54.380
You still have it?

01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:58.576
No, that's long gone,
but I do have this for you.

01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:00.357
I want you to have it.

01:18:01.620 --> 01:18:03.850
Thanks, it's really beautiful.

01:18:04.070 --> 01:18:06.076
What is that, what's that stone?

01:18:06.100 --> 01:18:07.601
That there is dinosaur bone.

01:18:07.625 --> 01:18:08.496
Really?

01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:11.370
I think so, but I only
know what they tell me.

01:18:11.970 --> 01:18:13.670
Where are your mom and dad?

01:18:13.850 --> 01:18:15.196
Back home in Wisconsin.

01:18:15.220 --> 01:18:17.000
You think they worry about you?

01:18:20.727 --> 01:18:22.281
You don't get lonely?

01:18:23.100 --> 01:18:24.990
Got a girlfriend anywhere?

01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:29.950
To be truthful, there is one.

01:18:30.462 --> 01:18:33.862
She lives up in the
North Country, small farm.

01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:36.500
She is happy with her life there.

01:18:38.370 --> 01:18:39.870
I...

01:18:40.900 --> 01:18:43.422
- write letters to her.
- Ah, smart man.

01:18:43.446 --> 01:18:45.046
Very good, letters are good.

01:18:45.070 --> 01:18:46.968
I just can't ever

01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:50.670
write about anything I
reckon she cared about.

01:18:53.220 --> 01:18:55.101
You ever tried poems?

01:18:56.420 --> 01:18:57.970
Can't say I have.

01:18:58.570 --> 01:19:00.788
I don't think I know one.

01:19:01.220 --> 01:19:02.720
Do you know any?

01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:06.976
How about one, that I
used for my wedding vow?

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.596
When I was not
much older than you.

01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:11.120
Well, right on.

01:19:11.670 --> 01:19:13.270
Mind if I hear it?

01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:15.420
Okay, let's see if I can remember it.

01:19:19.650 --> 01:19:22.050
Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?

01:19:22.595 --> 01:19:24.970
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.

01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:28.446
Rough winds do shake
the darling buds of May,

01:19:28.470 --> 01:19:32.270
And summer’s lease
hath all too short a date;

01:19:33.551 --> 01:19:37.050
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,

01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:40.450
And often is his gold complexion dimm'd.

01:19:40.820 --> 01:19:44.626
And every fair from
fair sometimes declines,

01:19:44.650 --> 01:19:49.000
By chance or nature’s
changing course undimm'd;

01:19:50.150 --> 01:19:53.050
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,

01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:57.320
Nor lose possession
of that fair thou ow’st;

01:19:57.416 --> 01:19:59.110
Nor

01:19:59.134 --> 01:20:00.798
shall

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:05.576
Nor shall death brag thou
walk’st in his shade,

01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:08.950
When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st:

01:20:10.271 --> 01:20:14.849
So long as men can
breathe and eyes can see,

01:20:14.873 --> 01:20:19.420
So long lives this, and
this gives life to thee.

01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:20.985
Fern.

01:22:21.700 --> 01:22:22.752
Hi.

01:22:22.776 --> 01:22:24.791
Hey!

01:22:29.850 --> 01:22:31.570
- You made it.
- Yeah.

01:22:35.748 --> 01:22:36.746
Wow.

01:22:36.770 --> 01:22:38.980
- Yeah, it's nice.
- Wow.

01:22:41.770 --> 01:22:44.120
- Come on in. I've got...
- OK, OK.

01:22:47.570 --> 01:22:49.121
- This is Emily.
- Hi.

01:22:49.145 --> 01:22:51.321
- My daughter in law.
- So nice to meet you.

01:22:51.345 --> 01:22:53.650
- Hi.
- Welcome.

01:22:53.770 --> 01:22:57.050
Hey everybody, this is Fern.

01:22:58.733 --> 01:23:00.526
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

01:23:00.550 --> 01:23:02.146
- Welcome welcome.
- Thank you.

01:23:02.170 --> 01:23:05.500
- You know James.
- Hi James, how are you?

01:23:05.569 --> 01:23:06.890
Thanks for having me.

01:23:06.914 --> 01:23:09.553
- Who's that, is that the guy?
- This is Daniel, this is the guy.

01:23:09.577 --> 01:23:10.826
- Say hi.
- Hi, hi, Daniel.

01:23:10.850 --> 01:23:12.876
- Hi, Daniel.
- How's the drive?

01:23:12.900 --> 01:23:14.846
It was great, little hairy in the end.

01:23:14.870 --> 01:23:15.976
That's a scary road.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.846
- In your van? We've heard about your van.
- Yeah.

01:23:18.870 --> 01:23:19.976
I'd like to see it.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:24.361
Well, I'll introduce you, at
some point. Thanks, yeah.

01:23:24.385 --> 01:23:26.576
- Where are you coming from?
- That's Peter.

01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:27.526
- Hi.
- Can I get you something?

01:23:27.550 --> 01:23:30.665
- Yeah, water would be great, thanks.
- Water? Great. Sure.

01:23:32.148 --> 01:23:33.980
You've been on the road long.

01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:36.546
Yeah, I worked for a while

01:23:36.570 --> 01:23:39.671
uh, but I've been traveling
since I last saw you. Yeah.

01:23:39.695 --> 01:23:40.788
There you go.

01:23:40.812 --> 01:23:42.265
Uh oh!

01:23:42.289 --> 01:23:43.921
You go to mommy.

01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:02.849
You had a flat.

01:24:03.618 --> 01:24:04.776
Huh?

01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:06.496
You had a flat tire in your van Dave.

01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:08.276
Oh okay.

01:24:08.300 --> 01:24:09.800
I haven't noticed.

01:24:10.522 --> 01:24:12.608
Cause you're staying.

01:24:13.250 --> 01:24:14.496
Yeah.

01:24:14.520 --> 01:24:15.526
Good.

01:24:15.550 --> 01:24:17.600
Yeah, I never expected to...

01:24:17.820 --> 01:24:20.950
I never thought I'd spend
another night under a roof but...

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.296
This is a really nice place Dave.

01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:25.970
Ah, you can stay.

01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:28.950
Good, thanks, I need to do laundry.

01:24:32.937 --> 01:24:35.300
I meant stay longer, Fern.

01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:38.000
They do have a guest house.

01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:42.620
I'm serious.

01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:44.930
What'd they think about that?

01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:47.200
I already asked them.

01:24:49.420 --> 01:24:50.920
I like you.

01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:53.500
Now, you are a good person.

01:24:53.770 --> 01:24:55.076
You...

01:24:55.100 --> 01:24:58.570
You get along well with
people for the most part.

01:24:58.820 --> 01:25:00.320
And I...

01:25:01.270 --> 01:25:03.070
I like being around you.

01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:06.450
I like being around you.

01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:07.846
Oh, what's up, what's up

01:25:07.870 --> 01:25:11.893
you don't wanna be that way, you
wanna be like this, don't you? Yeah.

01:25:13.850 --> 01:25:18.970
♪ Sometimes you get into an
ocean, to jump into the ocean.

01:25:20.500 --> 01:25:22.970
Here, he might be getting a little tired.

01:25:23.420 --> 01:25:26.400
- I gotta go to the kitchen.
- Okay.

01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:29.250
Just, there.

01:25:34.470 --> 01:25:36.520
Don't be gone long, Dave.

01:25:37.420 --> 01:25:38.920
Okay?

01:26:07.897 --> 01:26:09.718
- Come on, let's go.
- Come here.

01:26:09.742 --> 01:26:11.381
Come here.

01:26:14.670 --> 01:26:17.060
Could you come,
look at all of those?

01:26:17.350 --> 01:26:19.000
How many do you have?

01:26:19.470 --> 01:26:21.420
I don't know how
many of they are.

01:26:25.750 --> 01:26:28.300
That one's beautiful,
look at those feathers.

01:26:37.873 --> 01:26:40.793
- Thank you.
- I think it needs more stuffing and...

01:26:40.817 --> 01:26:43.261
- Corn?
- Little corn.

01:26:44.170 --> 01:26:45.496
What is that called?

01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:47.170
Thanks Fern.

01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:48.900
Gravy?

01:26:49.050 --> 01:26:51.600
This turkey is so moist.

01:26:53.100 --> 01:26:56.084
- Incredible food.
- Thank you Emma, thank you James.

01:26:56.250 --> 01:26:58.250
Just wanna say a little something...

01:26:59.370 --> 01:27:01.370
to welcome to Fern.

01:27:03.170 --> 01:27:06.770
To this feast of a family and...

01:27:06.870 --> 01:27:08.426
the new one and

01:27:08.450 --> 01:27:10.600
and I guess the old one.

01:27:11.350 --> 01:27:12.996
And everybody in between, so...

01:27:13.020 --> 01:27:15.128
- Welcome, Fern.
- Thank you very much.

01:27:15.152 --> 01:27:17.350
Happy Thanksgiving.

01:27:20.413 --> 01:27:22.920
I have the bells of a Croissante.

01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:40.326
I like that name, Empire.

01:27:40.350 --> 01:27:43.476
You know, we had an airport, public pool.

01:27:43.500 --> 01:27:44.740
Golf course.

01:27:44.764 --> 01:27:47.120
Wow sounds nice.

01:27:47.470 --> 01:27:49.500
What was your house like there?

01:27:50.020 --> 01:27:51.338
Nothing special.

01:27:51.362 --> 01:27:53.933
Just a company Track house.

01:27:55.320 --> 01:27:57.070
Actually it was special.

01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:00.796
We were right on the edge of town.

01:28:00.820 --> 01:28:04.650
And our backyard looks
out at this huge open space,

01:28:05.100 --> 01:28:07.426
it was just desert, desert, desert

01:28:07.450 --> 01:28:09.150
all the way to the mountains.

01:28:10.470 --> 01:28:12.270
There was nothing in our way.

01:28:14.100 --> 01:28:16.823
You know, I'm really glad you're here.

01:28:16.870 --> 01:28:18.650
Dave really likes you.

01:28:18.770 --> 01:28:20.246
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:28:20.270 --> 01:28:22.183
He talks about you a lot.

01:33:24.030 --> 01:33:26.179
Happy New Year!

01:33:28.370 --> 01:33:31.150
Happy New Year!

01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:05.160
Because she loved rocks.

01:34:16.097 --> 01:34:18.810
See you down road, Swankie.

01:34:54.320 --> 01:34:57.882
Bo never knew his parents,
and we never had kids.

01:34:58.620 --> 01:35:00.804
If I didn't stay.

01:35:01.020 --> 01:35:02.176
If I left

01:35:02.200 --> 01:35:05.093
it would be like he never existed.

01:35:06.470 --> 01:35:09.620
I couldn’t pack up and move on.

01:35:10.120 --> 01:35:11.980
He loved Empire.

01:35:12.970 --> 01:35:14.996
He loved his work so much.

01:35:15.020 --> 01:35:17.850
He loved being there, everybody loved him.

01:35:20.602 --> 01:35:22.300
So I stayed.

01:35:23.134 --> 01:35:25.493
Same town, same house.

01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:33.063
Just like my dad used to say.

01:35:33.350 --> 01:35:35.600
What's remembered lives.

01:35:39.250 --> 01:35:44.615
I maybe spent too much
of my life just remembering, Bob,

01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:48.470
- you know what I mean?
- I can.

01:35:49.300 --> 01:35:50.865
I can relate.

01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:55.320
I rarely ever talk about my son.

01:35:55.950 --> 01:35:58.620
But today would be

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.850
today would be his 33rd birthday and

01:36:07.450 --> 01:36:09.980
five years ago, he took his life.

01:36:14.520 --> 01:36:17.320
And I can still barely
say that in a sentence.

01:36:21.370 --> 01:36:23.550
And, and for a long time

01:36:25.770 --> 01:36:27.650
everyday

01:36:29.850 --> 01:36:31.450
the question was

01:36:32.470 --> 01:36:35.720
how can I be alive on
this Earth, when he's not?

01:36:37.950 --> 01:36:39.770
And I didn't have any answer.

01:36:41.300 --> 01:36:43.350
And those were some hard hard days.

01:36:45.850 --> 01:36:47.350
But.

01:36:48.970 --> 01:36:50.570
I realized that.

01:36:51.970 --> 01:36:54.050
I could honor him by

01:36:55.670 --> 01:36:58.250
helping people and serving people.

01:36:59.470 --> 01:37:01.876
It gives me a reason
to go through the day.

01:37:02.420 --> 01:37:04.520
Some days, that's all I've got.

01:37:07.970 --> 01:37:10.446
And out here, there's lot of people our age

01:37:10.470 --> 01:37:12.726
inevitably there's grief and loss.

01:37:12.750 --> 01:37:15.570
And lot of them
don't get over it either.

01:37:15.870 --> 01:37:17.671
And that's okay.

01:37:19.050 --> 01:37:20.992
That's OK.

01:37:21.870 --> 01:37:24.750
One of the thing that I
love most about this life

01:37:25.820 --> 01:37:27.320
is that

01:37:27.350 --> 01:37:29.046
there is no final goodbye.

01:37:29.070 --> 01:37:32.196
You know, I've met hundreds
of people out here and

01:37:32.220 --> 01:37:34.370
they don't ever say a final goodbye.

01:37:34.825 --> 01:37:37.696
I always just say, I'll
see you down the road.

01:37:37.720 --> 01:37:39.278
And I do.

01:37:39.650 --> 01:37:43.476
And whether it's a month,
or a year, or sometimes years.

01:37:43.500 --> 01:37:45.020
I see them again.

01:37:45.220 --> 01:37:48.426
I can look down the road and
I can be certain in my heart

01:37:48.450 --> 01:37:51.520
that I'll see my son again.

01:37:53.957 --> 01:37:55.750
You will see Bo again.

01:37:56.950 --> 01:37:59.820
And you can remember
your lives together then.

01:38:42.350 --> 01:38:44.426
Are you sure you don't
need any of these stuff?

01:38:44.450 --> 01:38:46.870
No, don't need any of it, I'm good.

01:38:47.370 --> 01:38:49.420
I am not gonna miss one thing.
