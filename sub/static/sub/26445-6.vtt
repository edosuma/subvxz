WEBVTT

00:11.261 --> 00:12.554
Oh, I think we're early.

00:12.637 --> 00:14.681
Yeah, the movie phone guy said

00:14.764 --> 00:18.393
"You've selected The Truman Show,
9:00 p.m."

00:18.810 --> 00:21.479
-I love that guy.
-Hey, since we have a second

00:21.563 --> 00:26.651
I was wondering if you would like
to smoke some marijuana.

00:27.235 --> 00:28.528
You know, I would.

00:28.611 --> 00:31.656
I am pressing one for the chronic.

00:31.740 --> 00:35.910
Ho, ho-ho! You're the movie phone guy
calling the movie phone guy.

00:35.994 --> 00:38.496
-Yes.
-Sounds like you've already smoked.

00:38.580 --> 00:40.707
Maybe just a little bit.

00:40.790 --> 00:42.792
[inhales, coughs]

00:42.876 --> 00:45.420
Sorry, weed is just really bad
at this point in time.

00:46.588 --> 00:50.133
Am I high, or is Jim Carrey
not funny in this movie?

00:50.925 --> 00:52.761
[both chuckling]

00:53.094 --> 00:56.306
Wow, imagine finding out
everything in your life was fake

00:56.389 --> 00:59.017
and you were just a character
on some TV show.

00:59.100 --> 01:00.560
That would be rough.

01:00.643 --> 01:03.188
-You're real, right, Shannon?
-I'm real, Greg.

01:03.271 --> 01:07.275
That's good,
'cause I think I maybe love you.

01:07.358 --> 01:09.194
I think I maybe love you, too.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.200
-Jesus, Greg!
-What?

01:15.283 --> 01:17.035
How many goddamn times
do I have to ask you

01:17.118 --> 01:19.954
not to forget your Eggo waffles
in the toaster!

01:20.038 --> 01:21.456
Oh, please, Shannon.

01:21.539 --> 01:23.541
I left those in there three days ago.

01:23.625 --> 01:25.668
Maybe you would've noticed
if you ever came up for air

01:25.752 --> 01:27.045
from Cantor Dina's ass!

01:27.128 --> 01:30.924
Just pick one of your dad's CDs
to drown out their squabbling.

01:31.007 --> 01:33.551
Phish? Grateful Dead?
Widespread Panic?

01:33.635 --> 01:36.429
-What is this crap?
-They're jam bands, sweetie.

01:36.513 --> 01:41.267
They were created by Big Nitrus
to sell canisters in parking lots.

01:41.351 --> 01:43.895
-Whoa! Is this--
-Ganja?

01:43.978 --> 01:45.188
-The Devil's Lettuce?
-What?

01:45.271 --> 01:47.148
-Sticky Icky? Daddy Boom-balatti?
-That's not--

01:47.232 --> 01:48.149
-Turtle.
-Turtle?

01:48.233 --> 01:49.317
-Hot Snookum.
-Really?

01:49.400 --> 01:51.861
-Goat Cheese Omelette.
-I got it.

01:51.945 --> 01:53.404
-Snoop's Bunion!
-Stop!

02:26.271 --> 02:27.105
[bell rings]

02:29.357 --> 02:31.985
Andrew! Where do you think you're going?

02:32.068 --> 02:34.154
-Uh... home?
-Oh my God! What the hell?

02:34.279 --> 02:37.157
My dad wants me to help him
throw out old Newsweek 's.

02:37.240 --> 02:40.243
You're not going anywhere
without giving me a kiss goodbye.

02:40.326 --> 02:42.162
Now that you're my boyfriend,

02:42.245 --> 02:43.705
there are like, rules.

02:43.788 --> 02:45.832
Wait, I'm your boyfriend? Since when?

02:45.915 --> 02:48.918
Hello? Since we Frenched twice already.

02:49.002 --> 02:51.713
And her tongue was slick and meaty,
like a fresh trout.

02:51.796 --> 02:54.465
-I do like a nice flakey fish.
-Who doesn't?

02:55.008 --> 02:56.759
[coughs]
When did you start smoking?

02:56.843 --> 03:00.054
Around when you started dating this chick.
I don't think the two are connected.

03:00.138 --> 03:01.764
I could quit anytime.

03:01.848 --> 03:05.185
Um, maybe we could go someplace
a little more private to kiss

03:05.268 --> 03:08.688
like I don't know,
that abandoned Wendy's down the street?

03:08.813 --> 03:12.650
No, I want to do it right here
with everyone watching

03:12.734 --> 03:15.195
you clump of shower drain hair.

03:15.278 --> 03:16.738
[Shame Wizard laughing]

03:16.821 --> 03:21.868
This young woman truly appreciates that
you're a human refuse.

03:21.951 --> 03:23.578
You should be treated as such.

03:23.661 --> 03:25.371
That's some twisted shit, dude.

03:25.455 --> 03:28.708
-Indeed. Do you care for a drink?
-I'm good. The smokes are plenty

03:28.791 --> 03:30.877
But you're way more fun when you drink.

03:30.960 --> 03:32.337
Really? Is that what people say?

03:32.420 --> 03:35.298
Come on, Maurice. Just a quick nip.

03:35.381 --> 03:37.091
Nip? [chuckles] All right.

03:37.800 --> 03:40.261
Gachi-machi. Andrew, let's do it.

03:40.345 --> 03:42.180
Let's French this blonde meatball.

03:42.263 --> 03:43.389
Yeah.

03:47.769 --> 03:50.104
-Oh, wow.
-Andrew and Lola?

03:50.188 --> 03:52.565
This is how I felt
when I saw my pediatrician at Lids.

03:52.649 --> 03:54.859
I couldn't believe it was happening
right in front of me.

03:54.943 --> 03:57.320
-Who cares? My boy's getting it.
-Ooh!

03:57.403 --> 03:59.739
Take it, Andrew!
Get it and then take it.

03:59.822 --> 04:02.617
Oh, no. That's not good.
They're brother-sister.

04:02.700 --> 04:04.911
-No, they aren't.
-Then why are they kissing?

04:04.994 --> 04:07.080
Well, they're--
Because they're not brother and sister.

04:07.163 --> 04:08.122
-What?
-Wait, what?

04:09.207 --> 04:12.085
That was like, stupid romantic.

04:12.168 --> 04:14.420
Now hold my book bag. I need to go piss.

04:14.504 --> 04:17.173
-I had two Barq's root beer at lunch.
-Okay.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.509
Meet me outside.
You're walking me home!

04:19.592 --> 04:22.428
-[grunts]
-So, bud, how's it going?

04:22.512 --> 04:24.138
Oh, things are going well.

04:24.222 --> 04:25.682
Lola... You know Lola, right?

04:25.807 --> 04:26.933
I do indeed.

04:27.016 --> 04:28.601
She says that I'm her boyfriend

04:28.685 --> 04:31.646
-Oh, wow, that's really--
-It's terrible, Nick!

04:31.729 --> 04:34.315
Good, yeah.
It's really a nightmare to watch.

04:34.399 --> 04:37.694
-Yeah, it's not that great to live either.
-I can only imagine.

04:37.777 --> 04:40.154
I have to break up with her, or kill her.
Or fake my own death

04:40.238 --> 04:41.239
Maybe join the army.

04:41.322 --> 04:43.741
There's not a war on, is there?
Like, other than the three wars

04:43.866 --> 04:45.451
-No. Break up with her.
-You really should

04:45.535 --> 04:48.288
because right now,
you are Lola's boyfriend.

04:48.371 --> 04:50.081
-Stop it.
-I'm standing here...

04:50.164 --> 04:52.292
-with Lola's...
-Stop it. Please stop saying that.

04:52.375 --> 04:53.793
-...boyfriend.
-I have a name!

04:53.876 --> 04:56.087
-Okay, bye, LBW.
-LBW?

04:56.170 --> 04:58.798
-What's the W for?
-Lola's Boyfriend...

04:58.881 --> 05:00.049
Wow. [laughs]

05:00.133 --> 05:01.467
Wow, indeed.

05:01.551 --> 05:04.095
Dude, Andrew and Lola is like...

05:04.846 --> 05:07.390
-woof.
-Yeah, totally. Woof to the max.

05:07.473 --> 05:09.392
Uh... should we just make a left here now?

05:09.475 --> 05:12.478
-Why?
-I just don't have to talk to Gina.

05:12.562 --> 05:14.647
-It's still so awkward.
-Yeah, I know.

05:14.731 --> 05:16.733
-Everything is super weird right now.
-I know.

05:16.816 --> 05:19.527
-You know, we're going through changes.
-Exactly.

05:19.610 --> 05:21.779
It just feels like
we could try drugs for the first time

05:21.863 --> 05:23.448
-and it wouldn't even be a big deal
-What?

05:23.531 --> 05:25.158
-What?
-Did you say we should try drugs?

05:25.241 --> 05:26.951
-I didn't say that.
-I think you just--

05:27.035 --> 05:29.162
-I feel weird that you're saying it.
-I'm super confused

05:29.245 --> 05:31.205
-Look what I found in my dad's stash.
-Gummy Bears?

05:31.289 --> 05:32.582
It's weed. They're edibles.

05:32.665 --> 05:34.208
-Edibles? Jessi...
-Yes?

05:34.292 --> 05:35.835
-Are you suggesting...
-Maybe?

05:35.918 --> 05:37.920
-I mean, are we those kids?
-[scoffs]

05:38.004 --> 05:39.881
Look, Barack Obama smoked weed.

05:39.964 --> 05:42.216
He was our best president,
and his wife is perfect.

05:42.300 --> 05:43.384
God, don't you miss them?

05:43.468 --> 05:45.511
Everyday.
Their daughters, that dog...

05:45.595 --> 05:47.889
-Right.
-Hold on, are you peer pressuring me?

05:47.972 --> 05:49.432
No, of course not!

05:49.515 --> 05:52.060
If you want to have a little dick
and do little dick boys' stuff...

05:52.143 --> 05:54.729
-No! I want to be a big dick boy.
-All right.

05:55.563 --> 05:57.690
Hmm. I think I can kind of taste the weed.

05:57.774 --> 05:58.983
You know, I don't mind it

05:59.067 --> 06:00.360
-'cause I got a big dick!
-What?

06:00.443 --> 06:02.570
-Biddy-bee! Big dick boy!
-Argh!

06:02.653 --> 06:04.447
-Smoke chronic, big dick!
-What voice is that?

06:04.530 --> 06:07.450
-Biddy-bee smoke weed-ee-weed
-This might've been a mistake

06:07.992 --> 06:11.120
Like, welcome to my condo, Andrew.

06:11.704 --> 06:15.625
What a lovely home. Is your TV fake?

06:15.708 --> 06:18.961
Yeah, my mom staged the place to be sold,

06:19.087 --> 06:22.840
so like everything is, like,
not as it seems.

06:23.174 --> 06:25.843
Oh, I love this condominium.

06:25.927 --> 06:28.221
It simply reeks of shame.

06:28.304 --> 06:30.431
I think it's
all the Aerosmith Glade plugins.

06:30.515 --> 06:32.141
[hissing, shouting]

06:32.225 --> 06:34.268
This whole thing is giving me
a fucking migraine.

06:34.352 --> 06:35.395
I have something for that.

06:35.478 --> 06:36.479
KLO-LOLA-PIN
20 mg

06:38.564 --> 06:39.982
-Okay.
-Look!

06:40.066 --> 06:42.693
That's when my mom took me and Devin
to see Mow Mow

06:42.777 --> 06:45.071
-the barren koala.
-Wait, what?

06:45.154 --> 06:48.032
[Lola] It was on a baseball field.
It was awesome.

06:48.116 --> 06:51.077
Huh. It looks like
you're cut out of the frame.

06:51.160 --> 06:52.995
I know. My mom is so funny.

06:53.121 --> 06:54.163
This one time

06:54.247 --> 06:57.166
she always joke said
she wishes I was Devin.

06:57.250 --> 07:00.253
Yeah, my dad always jokes
that I was somehow responsible

07:00.336 --> 07:02.296
for Charlie Sheen
leaving Two and a Half Men.

07:02.380 --> 07:04.882
Oh my God. We're like the same.

07:04.966 --> 07:08.094
Ha-ha. Yeah! I need to end this
before it goes any further, right?

07:08.177 --> 07:09.178
Yeah, good call.

07:09.262 --> 07:12.390
So, Lola,
I was thinking that maybe we should--

07:13.850 --> 07:17.186
That maybe we should rub fronts?

07:17.812 --> 07:18.896
Oi va-voy.

07:18.980 --> 07:21.399
Hold on. Does he wanna dry hump?

07:21.482 --> 07:23.401
-Oh, God.
-You can't pass up the opportunity

07:23.484 --> 07:26.154
to grind your dick against
a rough denim pant.

07:26.237 --> 07:28.948
-But wasn't I about to break up with her?
-Yeah, right.

07:29.031 --> 07:31.993
-Let's stay focused.
-Need a little pick-me-up, friend?

07:32.076 --> 07:34.871
Wait, is that coke?
No, get that shit out of here

07:34.954 --> 07:36.414
Unless you're gonna throw it out

07:36.539 --> 07:38.958
then I'll just... [sniffs]
stick it up my nose for safe-keeping

07:39.041 --> 07:40.251
[sniffs]

07:40.334 --> 07:43.921
Hey, Humpty Dumpty,
last one to rub my front is a rotten egg

07:44.046 --> 07:46.757
-you, rotten egg.
-Oh, God.

07:47.091 --> 07:48.926
That actually sounds kind of nice.

07:49.010 --> 07:51.429
Spread 'em, so we can Lego our legs.

07:52.013 --> 07:53.890
Yeah! Lego her Eggo, you rotten egg!

07:53.973 --> 07:55.516
Okay, easy. Okay...

07:55.600 --> 07:58.102
-[Maury] Hmm! Yummy!
-[Shadow Wizard evil laughter]

07:59.061 --> 08:00.563
I don't think I feel anything.

08:00.646 --> 08:01.606
Yeah, me neither.

08:01.689 --> 08:05.026
-I will say your elbows are hilarious.
-Yeah, elbows.

08:05.109 --> 08:07.487
I guess they're the knees of the arms,
you know what I mean?

08:07.570 --> 08:09.071
If the elbows are the knees of the arms

08:09.197 --> 08:12.200
then are the knuckles
the knees of the finger?

08:12.283 --> 08:13.534
-Finger-knees.
-Finger...

08:15.411 --> 08:17.580
-Are we high?
-I don't know.

08:17.663 --> 08:20.124
I mean, I do feel very good right now

08:20.208 --> 08:23.085
and I can see
why my dad is addicted to this.

08:24.420 --> 08:27.798
-Am I allowed to laugh at that, too?
-Yes, it's really funny.

08:27.882 --> 08:30.009
-Oh my God.
-We are so funny right now.

08:30.092 --> 08:31.344
Whoa, whoa!

08:31.427 --> 08:33.304
-Look at my finger-knees move.
-Whoa!

08:33.387 --> 08:34.597
I'm literally not doing this.

08:34.805 --> 08:37.058
-It's so crazy.
-My fingers are moving, and...

08:37.600 --> 08:39.602
-[Nick] Whoa!
-[Jessi] Whoa!

08:39.810 --> 08:41.562
-That's crazy.
-[Nick] So crazy.

08:41.646 --> 08:43.606
[Jessi] Wait, did you hear me say that?

08:43.689 --> 08:45.942
Because I did not say it out loud.

08:46.025 --> 08:47.568
[Nick] Yeah, I can totally hear you.

08:47.652 --> 08:50.738
Jessi, are we speaking telepathically?

08:50.821 --> 08:53.074
[Jessi] Yeah, we are. This is nuts!

08:53.157 --> 08:55.409
I'm saying things back with my mind!

08:55.493 --> 08:57.495
Me too,
but my mouth isn't moving at all.

08:57.578 --> 08:59.038
No, mine's not moving either!

08:59.121 --> 09:02.917
This is the craziest thing
humanity has ever seen.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.710
[both panting]

09:04.794 --> 09:08.256
This feels real good,
but it's real wrong, right?

09:08.339 --> 09:10.091
We gotta get the fuck out of here.

09:10.174 --> 09:13.636
But, Maurice,
the party's just getting started.

09:13.719 --> 09:16.681
Lola, I can't help but think--
Oh my God.

09:16.764 --> 09:18.599
Okay, but after this, no more.

09:18.683 --> 09:19.517
Of course!

09:19.600 --> 09:22.687
It's actually very freeing to know
that this is the last time.

09:22.770 --> 09:23.813
[both moaning]

09:23.896 --> 09:25.565
[sniffing]

09:25.648 --> 09:27.358
-[groans]
-Aah!

09:27.441 --> 09:29.443
[hissing]

09:29.777 --> 09:31.779
[moans, grunts]

09:32.238 --> 09:34.448
A little more. A little bit more.

09:34.532 --> 09:35.533
[exhales deeply]

09:35.616 --> 09:37.285
Oh my God, Andrew.

09:37.368 --> 09:39.495
Is there supposed to be that much?

09:39.579 --> 09:42.415
But in the same token, I'm very flattered.

09:42.498 --> 09:44.292
I'm so sorry. I normally don't--

09:44.375 --> 09:46.752
[groaning]
A bit of an after-shock. Sorry.

09:46.836 --> 09:48.087
We should totally cuddle

09:48.170 --> 09:51.299
after I get a string cheese
from the garage.

09:51.799 --> 09:52.883
[Shame Wizard laughs]

09:52.967 --> 09:56.262
Poor Andrew.
You can't very well break up with her now.

09:56.345 --> 09:57.555
Oh, shit. I can't?

09:57.638 --> 10:02.977
You're not the sort of boy who rubs fronts
with the world's saddest girl

10:03.060 --> 10:05.438
and leaves right after, are you?

10:05.563 --> 10:07.481
No, I guess I'm not.

10:07.565 --> 10:10.776
Let's go for a string cheese.
You lost a lot of protein, brother.

10:12.111 --> 10:13.863
Finger-knees!

10:13.988 --> 10:17.450
I went on a vacation to the finger-knees!

10:17.867 --> 10:20.036
You were the right person
to get high with.

10:20.119 --> 10:21.746
-Stop laughing at me.
-[laughing]

10:21.829 --> 10:22.747
Stop it!

10:22.830 --> 10:25.750
-Um... Okay?
-I'm hungry and my teeth are too hard.

10:25.833 --> 10:27.668
Okay, no worries.

10:27.793 --> 10:30.630
Peace and love. We're all good.
Wait, look! Across the street.

10:30.713 --> 10:32.965
It's Missy's house.
She'll feed us, man.

10:33.049 --> 10:34.759
Yeah, Missy's good.
She's peace and love.

10:34.842 --> 10:37.011
She's totally peace and love.
Everything's fine.

10:37.094 --> 10:39.096
-Missy peace and love.
-Just keep it together, dude.

10:39.180 --> 10:40.389
[door bell rings]

10:40.473 --> 10:43.809
Jessi? Nick? Could it be?
A drop by playdate?

10:43.893 --> 10:45.186
What a nice surprise!

10:45.311 --> 10:46.979
Hello, friends of Missy.

10:47.063 --> 10:49.398
I am Embarrassing Robot Dad.

10:49.482 --> 10:50.524
-What?
-Dad!

10:50.608 --> 10:53.110
That's too funny!
Oh my God, this is already going great.

10:53.194 --> 10:55.196
What's this guy fucking deal?
Is he fucking with us?

10:55.279 --> 10:57.782
-Nick, chill out.
-Fuck this guy. He fucking knows.

10:57.865 --> 10:59.116
Whoa!

10:59.200 --> 11:02.578
I've never noticed how cool
your house is before, Missy.

11:02.662 --> 11:03.537
Uh, yeah.

11:03.621 --> 11:07.625
Monica, what is this hypnotic music
that's like giving me life right now?

11:07.708 --> 11:10.086
-I don't like it.
-It's Northern African tribal music,

11:10.211 --> 11:11.837
and Nick, you'll find this funny,

11:11.921 --> 11:14.256
the band's actually called Steely Sudan.

11:14.340 --> 11:15.716
Ha-ha, yeah. Oh, ha-ha.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.176
Is that how I laugh? I forget.

11:17.259 --> 11:19.595
I think I need to get some food
into my system.

11:19.679 --> 11:22.932
Oh, good! We were just about to do
an Ezekiel bread rising.

11:23.015 --> 11:26.143
And we have room temp carrot juice,
so hope your appetite's up.

11:26.227 --> 11:30.022
Oh my God,
that is exactly what I was craving.

11:30.147 --> 11:32.274
I guess my real question is

11:32.358 --> 11:34.193
-can you hear the beat?
-What?

11:34.276 --> 11:35.820
-Can anyone hear the beat?
-Oh my God!

11:35.903 --> 11:37.655
Can you hear the beat?

11:37.738 --> 11:39.490
-I saw your penis.
-Gina?

11:39.573 --> 11:40.825
-Tiny penis.
-What?

11:40.908 --> 11:43.327
-I saw your penis. Tiny penis!
-[Nick] Oh my God.

11:43.452 --> 11:45.162
Bonjour, little dick boy.

11:45.246 --> 11:48.165
Life is meaningless,
and you are all alone.

11:48.249 --> 11:49.333
-What?
-[man 1] Alone.

11:49.417 --> 11:50.710
-I am?
-[man 1] Forever.

11:50.793 --> 11:51.711
Alone.

11:51.794 --> 11:54.046
-[Jessi] Can you...
-[Missy] Stop saying that!

11:55.339 --> 11:57.925
-Can you, Missy, hear the beat?
-I can hear it!

11:58.217 --> 12:00.761
If I can just get everyone's attention,
I'd love to make a toast.

12:00.845 --> 12:02.888
You have a really cool house,
but it's freaking me out

12:02.972 --> 12:04.807
and I need to be alone right fucking now.

12:06.434 --> 12:08.352
Oh! Thank God. What?

12:09.061 --> 12:11.814
Alone Zone? Oh no.

12:12.815 --> 12:15.025
Thank you for lending me these pants?

12:15.109 --> 12:17.987
It's like I basically own you now.

12:18.070 --> 12:21.490
Hey, man, we gotta get out of here.
I feel like I've been awake for a month.

12:21.574 --> 12:24.034
Lola, this has been wonderful

12:24.118 --> 12:25.995
but I actually have to get home
for dinner.

12:26.078 --> 12:28.873
Well, I have dinner plans too,
Mr. Popular.

12:28.956 --> 12:33.085
I'm dying solo on a margarita fettuccine
Lean Cuisine I thawed in the sink

12:33.169 --> 12:35.546
because my microwave is broken.

12:35.629 --> 12:38.299
So you're just gonna leave her here
all alone

12:38.382 --> 12:40.384
while you waltz off in her pants,

12:40.468 --> 12:42.553
because you defiled yours?

12:42.636 --> 12:44.472
Oh God, he's right.

12:44.555 --> 12:48.142
Lola, do you want to come over
to my house for dinner?

12:48.225 --> 12:50.060
What? Are you joking me?

12:50.144 --> 12:51.312
Who would want that?

12:51.395 --> 12:53.647
No, but like, I definitely will.

12:54.148 --> 12:55.858
Hello? Is anybody here?

12:55.941 --> 12:56.859
I'm here.

12:56.942 --> 12:58.861
-What? Who are you?
-I'm you...

12:58.944 --> 13:00.488
in the future.

13:00.571 --> 13:03.407
Wait, what's future me doing
in the Alone Zone?

13:03.491 --> 13:04.825
-You live here.
-What?

13:04.909 --> 13:07.328
So come on in or shake your booty

13:07.411 --> 13:10.664
'cause this is your fabulous life.

13:10.748 --> 13:12.917
Whoa! This place is baller.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.376
What do I do in the future?

13:14.460 --> 13:17.463
You're a TV personality, Nick.
Star, of course...

13:17.546 --> 13:20.007
-Whoa!
-...and you have your own show on Nitflax.

13:20.132 --> 13:23.469
It's a cartoon
about how you rocked as a kid.

13:23.552 --> 13:25.262
-Do I like it?
-You don't mind it

13:25.346 --> 13:27.973
although you'd like to do
more dramatic roles.

13:28.057 --> 13:29.350
-How come?
-I don't know.

13:29.433 --> 13:31.227
It's a pure ego thing.

13:31.310 --> 13:33.062
So I'm happy, right?

13:33.145 --> 13:35.773
Nick, you make more money
than you could ever use

13:35.856 --> 13:38.734
and you feel alone every single day.

13:38.818 --> 13:41.821
So do I have a wife or kids?

13:41.904 --> 13:45.032
[chuckles] No way, Nick.
Those things have needs

13:45.115 --> 13:46.826
and you're allergic to that.

13:46.909 --> 13:51.121
You'll always have the company
of your best friend and robot Butler

13:51.205 --> 13:53.582
Andrew 3000.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.960
I cleaned your bidet, Mr. Star.

13:56.043 --> 13:59.839
If I am unneeded I will go
to my jack off cubby and jack off.

13:59.922 --> 14:02.258
See you later, simulated best friend.

14:02.341 --> 14:03.926
Correction: Only friend.

14:04.009 --> 14:05.261
Goodbye, Nick.

14:05.344 --> 14:07.847
Nick...

14:08.264 --> 14:10.140
Nick! Earth to Nick!

14:10.224 --> 14:11.475
Dude, are you all right?

14:11.559 --> 14:13.769
You farted,
and then you said we were at war.

14:13.853 --> 14:15.771
Oh, yeah. I just gotta...

14:15.855 --> 14:18.399
I think I'm just gonna
get the fuck out of here.

14:18.774 --> 14:20.401
-What?
-Nick, come back!

14:20.484 --> 14:22.820
-We were having so much fun!
-Oh, no.

14:22.903 --> 14:24.989
That little dude is going tweakie-deekie!

14:25.072 --> 14:27.616
-What's wrong with Nick?
-Don't tell her! She's a snitch!

14:27.700 --> 14:30.995
Okay, Missy, you seriously have to promise
not to say anything...

14:31.078 --> 14:32.079
-Of course.
-...to anyone.

14:32.162 --> 14:33.831
I'd be proud to be your confidant

14:33.914 --> 14:35.916
[deep exhales]

14:36.041 --> 14:38.127
Nick and I ate some weed gummies,
and got so high

14:38.210 --> 14:40.254
and now he's freaking out,
and I don't know what to do

14:40.337 --> 14:42.840
Ozari! You guys did marijuana?

14:42.923 --> 14:45.175
Don't you know what that will do
to your developing brains?

14:45.259 --> 14:47.636
You're probably never gonna be able
to remember anything again

14:47.720 --> 14:50.472
Do you know who I am right now?
God, I'm freaking out.

14:50.556 --> 14:52.850
Am I getting a contact high?
Are we going to jail?

14:52.933 --> 14:55.185
[groans]
I cannot deal with this nerd.

14:55.269 --> 14:57.479
I'm gonna lie down
and watch the Great British Bake Off.

14:57.563 --> 14:59.732
They're so nice to each other.

14:59.815 --> 15:02.401
Missy, can you please
just help me find Nick?

15:02.484 --> 15:04.695
Fine. But then you're going straight
to rehab

15:04.778 --> 15:05.779
Okay, yeah, right.

15:05.863 --> 15:08.240
-I'm gonna find a way to snitch you out.
-What?

15:08.324 --> 15:10.576
-[panting]
-Is that... Oh, shit.

15:11.076 --> 15:12.411
Nick. Hey!

15:12.494 --> 15:15.247
I was just trying out
that new Uber bicycle app

15:15.331 --> 15:17.666
and Lola is one of their drivers.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.418
Oh my God. He's lying.

15:19.501 --> 15:21.128
He blammo'd in his pants

15:21.211 --> 15:23.756
and now we're both literally starving.

15:23.839 --> 15:25.549
Me, too. We're all starving...

15:25.633 --> 15:27.760
-for human connection.
-What?

15:27.843 --> 15:30.346
Andrew, listen to me.
You gotta hold onto Lola.

15:30.429 --> 15:32.473
If you don't,
you're gonna meet your future self

15:32.556 --> 15:35.184
-and he's gonna remind you of Bill Maher.
-What?

15:35.267 --> 15:36.477
-[dog barking]
-[panting]

15:36.560 --> 15:38.771
-[dog] Nick!
-What? Who said that? Who's there?

15:38.854 --> 15:41.065
[dog] Over here, man. Behind the gate.

15:41.148 --> 15:42.191
Hey, Nick.

15:42.274 --> 15:46.195
You're Jay's Pitbull Featuring Ludacris,
and you can talk.

15:46.278 --> 15:48.364
You don't look so good.
Everything okay?

15:48.447 --> 15:50.449
No, I'm worried
that I'm gonna die alone.

15:50.532 --> 15:52.701
Hey, Brother. I get it.

15:52.785 --> 15:55.454
There was this beagle who lived next door
at the Goldbergs.

15:55.537 --> 15:56.747
We really hit it off.

15:56.830 --> 15:59.124
She was super funny, kind eyes.

15:59.208 --> 16:00.042
That's really nice.

16:00.125 --> 16:04.004
So I wanted to, you know,
jack hammer her so hard

16:04.088 --> 16:04.922
Oh.

16:05.005 --> 16:07.383
My back paws sliding across
the kitchen floor.

16:07.466 --> 16:09.468
-Sure.
-But she wasn't in heat

16:09.551 --> 16:12.096
-so I kind of bailed on her.
-Oh really?

16:12.179 --> 16:15.391
And then Jay's brother pegged her
in the eye with a slingshot.

16:15.474 --> 16:17.893
-And... she died.
-Oh my God.

16:17.977 --> 16:21.188
Yeah, man. Real connection is rare...

16:21.271 --> 16:23.565
like a white shit.

16:23.649 --> 16:25.693
Whoa! You are such a wise dog.

16:25.776 --> 16:26.902
Thanks, man.

16:26.986 --> 16:29.655
-I like you, too.
-Nick, what the hell?

16:29.738 --> 16:33.659
-We should hang out more.
-Featuring Ludacris will shred your balls.

16:33.742 --> 16:37.246
Just ask my neighbor, Darren.
His sack looks like a park basketball net

16:37.329 --> 16:39.415
-[laughs] What an idiot.
-There you are!

16:39.498 --> 16:42.292
-We've been looking all over for you.
-What are you guys doing here?

16:42.376 --> 16:44.378
Nick and Jessi got high
on marijuana drug candy

16:44.461 --> 16:46.463
and Nick is freaking out
and Jessi feels super guilty

16:46.547 --> 16:47.798
-Missy!
-I'm also disappointed

16:47.881 --> 16:50.134
Cuz I thought they're stopping by
for an impromptu playdate

16:50.217 --> 16:52.094
-but they weren't.
-Told you not to say anything!

16:52.177 --> 16:53.637
Oh shit, you guys are stoned?

16:53.721 --> 16:55.806
Oh! I haven't smoked pot
since the third grade.

16:55.889 --> 16:58.559
It was fucking with my libido.
I couldn't get hard...

16:58.892 --> 17:00.060
-enough.
-Ugh!

17:00.144 --> 17:01.645
Ugh! I think I need some food.

17:01.729 --> 17:04.773
Hey, isn't there that off-brand
ice cream place right around the corner?

17:04.857 --> 17:06.400
Ooh, Basket Roberts!

17:06.483 --> 17:10.112
If you guys take me to ice cream,
I will give blowjobs to everyone.

17:10.195 --> 17:11.822
-All right, let's do this.
-Jay!

17:11.905 --> 17:14.783
What? A blowjob's a blowjob.
Don't be gay.

17:14.867 --> 17:15.743
[door opens]

17:15.826 --> 17:16.660
You're late!

17:16.744 --> 17:18.954
I had to throw out
those Newsweek 's myself!

17:19.038 --> 17:20.247
Andrew, who's this?

17:20.330 --> 17:22.624
Mom, Dad, set an extra place.

17:22.708 --> 17:24.293
This is my friend, Lola.

17:24.376 --> 17:26.462
I'm your girlfriend, you putz!

17:26.545 --> 17:28.338
You be respectful, you putz!

17:28.422 --> 17:30.382
-He is a putz, isn't he?
-Um, yeah.

17:30.466 --> 17:32.801
Andrew,
why are you wearing Lola's sweatpants?

17:32.885 --> 17:35.888
-Um... because it's the new thing.
-I don't like new things!

17:35.971 --> 17:38.557
I stopped liking new things
at Who Wants to be a Millionaire.

17:38.640 --> 17:41.060
Oh my God.
I totally want to be a millionaire.

17:41.143 --> 17:42.394
No kidding! Me, too!

17:42.478 --> 17:45.022
Andrew, me and your dad
are total twinsies.

17:45.105 --> 17:47.149
This is unbelievable. Who are you?

17:47.232 --> 17:51.361
It's crazy, 'cause me and my dad
are like basically mortal enemies.

17:51.445 --> 17:53.072
You know who my mortal enemy is?

17:53.155 --> 17:55.032
-Ashton Kutcher!
-Jesus Christ.

17:55.115 --> 17:57.367
He thought he could replace Charlie Sheen.

17:57.451 --> 17:59.745
Please! Where's that show now?

17:59.828 --> 18:01.038
Off the air!

18:01.121 --> 18:02.873
And this one couldn't be happier about it.

18:02.956 --> 18:04.291
I had nothing to do with it!

18:04.374 --> 18:06.752
Oh, please! You love Kutcher.

18:06.835 --> 18:08.921
Walk me through how I did that.

18:09.004 --> 18:12.424
All I'm saying is that
sorbet is bullshit, okay?

18:12.508 --> 18:14.009
Missy, is that Gina?

18:14.093 --> 18:15.928
-Yes?
-It's not some weird bird statue, right?

18:16.011 --> 18:18.347
-Wow, you're really high.
-Should I go talk to her?

18:18.430 --> 18:21.767
-A hundred percent no.
-Okay, wish me luck.

18:21.975 --> 18:25.020
-Hey, Gina.
-Hey, Nick. What are you doing here?

18:25.104 --> 18:27.606
I thought I wanted ice cream,
but now I see you

18:27.689 --> 18:30.192
and I think I think I want to say,
like, I'm sorry?

18:30.275 --> 18:32.361
-I'm listening.
-We had this great connection

18:32.444 --> 18:34.363
and then I was like, "Do you like me?

18:34.446 --> 18:36.448
And if not, can't be friends. I'm Nick."

18:36.532 --> 18:38.867
That's actually
a really good impression of yourself.

18:38.951 --> 18:41.120
-Thanks. I've been working on it a lot.
-[giggling]

18:41.411 --> 18:42.579
Nick seems okay now.

18:42.663 --> 18:45.290
I'm glad he decided to be okay
as soon as he saw Gina

18:45.374 --> 18:47.417
[growls] Take two boobs
and call me in the morning.

18:47.501 --> 18:50.045
I don't know if the Surgeon General
would agree with that.

18:50.129 --> 18:51.839
Hey, Gina? Do you ever, like...

18:51.922 --> 18:53.799
Do you ever feel like, really alone?

18:53.882 --> 18:55.759
Uh... Sure, Nick.

18:55.843 --> 18:57.636
Yeah, sometimes. Are you okay?

18:57.719 --> 19:00.180
Why am I even asking?
I mean, you have DeVon, so..

19:00.264 --> 19:02.099
-Actually, I don't.
-What?

19:02.182 --> 19:03.100
We broke up.

19:03.183 --> 19:04.184
-You did?
-Yeah.

19:04.601 --> 19:06.687
'Cause I think he still likes Devin.

19:07.855 --> 19:09.773
-It's a call back to my voice.
-Yeah, it was.

19:09.857 --> 19:12.818
You're so funny,
and you have such kind eyes.

19:12.901 --> 19:14.027
You're like a white shit.

19:14.111 --> 19:16.029
-Excuse me?
-Oh, nothing.

19:16.113 --> 19:17.948
Can we please just be friends again?

19:18.031 --> 19:19.867
-Yeah, I'd like that.
-Great.

19:19.950 --> 19:24.288
So anyway, I think I'm almost for sure
having a heart attack right now

19:24.371 --> 19:27.332
-and I'm going to sprint to the hospital.
-Bye!

19:27.416 --> 19:31.086
Yeah, I'll have two scoops
of that white shit he was talking about.

19:38.927 --> 19:40.512
[chuckles] It's good.

19:40.596 --> 19:42.848
It's a family recipe. Cream of onion.

19:42.931 --> 19:44.933
It's saltless, 'cause I hate salt.

19:45.142 --> 19:47.436
-I think it's an overrated spice.
-Ew, me too.

19:47.519 --> 19:50.355
It tastes like the sea,
and it's in everything!

19:50.439 --> 19:51.273
[sighs]

19:52.024 --> 19:54.693
Hi there, my little Drew-Drew-train.

19:54.776 --> 19:57.070
It's me, Mo-la.

19:57.613 --> 20:00.532
-Oh! What the fuck is happening?
-Remember when we, like,

20:00.949 --> 20:03.368
rubbed fronts earlier today, baby?

20:03.452 --> 20:04.453
Oh, no...

20:04.536 --> 20:06.413
-Wake up, Maurice.
-[snoring]

20:06.496 --> 20:08.624
Andrew wants another kiss

20:08.707 --> 20:12.127
and he can't do that
without his beloved Hormone Monster.

20:12.211 --> 20:13.545
-[Shadow Wizard grunts]
-[gasps]

20:13.629 --> 20:15.172
What the hell is going on?

20:15.672 --> 20:17.716
I believe Andrew's in love.

20:17.799 --> 20:20.552
How about to make your own soup
for Mo-la?

20:20.636 --> 20:25.140
A little cream of undies?
It's a family recipe.

20:25.224 --> 20:26.808
Jesus, Andrew. Look at us.

20:26.934 --> 20:28.435
We're both in Lola's sweatpants.

20:28.518 --> 20:30.604
I'm drugged up,
you're about to fuck your dad.

20:30.687 --> 20:32.648
-We've hit rock bottom, brother.
-He's right.

20:32.731 --> 20:34.566
This here, this right here...

20:34.650 --> 20:36.610
This has to end now.

20:37.819 --> 20:40.739
-Lola, I need to talk to you outside.
-Uh-oh!

20:40.822 --> 20:42.866
You wanna get
your little butt grabbed again?

20:42.950 --> 20:45.994
No offense, but your son's a total perv.

20:46.078 --> 20:47.454
-[door opens]
-Tell me about it!

20:47.537 --> 20:49.456
I don't know what she sees in him.

20:50.165 --> 20:50.999
EMERGENCY ROOM

20:52.376 --> 20:55.837
-Oh! Oh my God.
-Oh! I know you.

20:55.921 --> 20:57.756
I held you when you were a baby.

20:57.839 --> 21:00.259
I'm sorry sir,
but I don't think that's true.

21:00.342 --> 21:01.176
[screams]

21:01.760 --> 21:03.303
Oh, Judd. Jesus!

21:03.387 --> 21:05.806
What are you doing here?
What happened your hand?

21:05.889 --> 21:07.849
I was training a battalion of raccoons,

21:07.933 --> 21:10.936
and I pushed them a little too hard.
What are you doing here, numb-nuts?

21:11.019 --> 21:14.398
I ate a weed gummy with Jessi,
and I think I'm having a heart attack.

21:14.481 --> 21:16.483
You're not having a heart attack.
You're just stoned

21:16.566 --> 21:18.485
-No one's ever died from pot.
-Thank God.

21:18.568 --> 21:20.237
Come on, little pecker.
I'll take you home

21:20.320 --> 21:22.656
-What do I tell Mom and Dad?
-Jack shit.

21:22.739 --> 21:24.491
-We just gotta sober you up.
-How?

21:24.574 --> 21:26.702
It's simple.
I drive you home at 100 miles an hour.

21:26.785 --> 21:28.870
-Does it have to be that fast?
-Yes.

21:28.954 --> 21:31.415
-You can't wear seat belt.
-[squeaks, growls]

21:31.498 --> 21:33.500
[engine starts]

21:33.834 --> 21:34.918
Asshole!

21:35.877 --> 21:37.921
-Jessi!
-Where were you? it's after nine.

21:38.005 --> 21:39.631
We were at Missy's house.

21:39.715 --> 21:42.009
We had to wait
for the Ezekiel bread to rise.

21:42.092 --> 21:44.594
-It's an ancient grain.
-Uh-huh. Look at me.

21:44.678 --> 21:46.888
Your eyes are very red.
Are you feeling okay?

21:46.972 --> 21:49.224
-Yeah. I'm just kinda tired.
-You're stoned.

21:49.308 --> 21:51.935
-[giggles] What? No way.
-Don't lie to me.

21:52.019 --> 21:53.979
I know what stoned looks like. Come here.

21:54.688 --> 21:56.565
See how my pupils
are dilating with the light

21:56.648 --> 21:58.066
but yours aren't? You're high.

21:58.150 --> 22:00.360
-Oh, shit. My gummies.
-What?

22:00.444 --> 22:02.404
I... I'm missing some of my edibles.

22:02.487 --> 22:04.614
At first I thought
maybe I forgot I ate them, but--

22:04.698 --> 22:06.575
-Jesus--
-I took them, okay?

22:06.658 --> 22:07.951
-It's not a big deal.
-Wow, Greg.

22:08.035 --> 22:11.038
Who could've possibly given her
the impression that it's not a big deal?

22:11.121 --> 22:12.914
-I'm sorry, Shannon-
-No, that's it!

22:12.998 --> 22:14.249
-I didn't mean--
-You're done.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.918
-It was an accident.
-You're moving out tonight.

22:17.002 --> 22:18.879
-No!
-Jessi, go to your room.

22:18.962 --> 22:20.422
It's not dad's fault.

22:20.505 --> 22:23.258
He didn't do anything.
I'm the one who got high.

22:23.342 --> 22:25.552
No, honey. Your mother's right.

22:25.635 --> 22:27.262
-This one's on me.
-Dad...

22:27.721 --> 22:29.097
I'll get my stuff.

22:31.183 --> 22:32.768
Oh, no!

22:32.851 --> 22:35.854
Lola, we've had
a very special day together

22:35.937 --> 22:39.775
but I think perhaps
we'd be better off as friends?

22:39.900 --> 22:41.610
Wait, hold on. What?

22:41.693 --> 22:43.737
Are you breaking up with me?

22:43.820 --> 22:45.197
Don't think of it that way.

22:45.280 --> 22:48.825
I thought we were genuinely,
like, a good couple.

22:48.909 --> 22:50.202
No Lola, don't cry.

22:50.285 --> 22:52.746
But you're weak and boring

22:52.829 --> 22:54.748
and, like, a nobody!

22:54.831 --> 22:58.543
What does it mean that
even you don't want to be with me?

22:58.627 --> 23:01.129
Let's not ask ourselves
these hard questions

23:01.213 --> 23:04.341
-but I really do hope we can be friends.
-[growls]

23:04.424 --> 23:06.676
Okay, Lola. You're hurting me.

23:06.760 --> 23:10.055
You sleezeball! I rubbed fronts with you

23:10.138 --> 23:13.183
and then you just, like,
dump me like a dump truck.

23:13.266 --> 23:15.352
Oh, God, you're so strong.

23:15.435 --> 23:18.063
I thought you were a good guy
like Dr. Phil

23:18.146 --> 23:21.024
but you're a bad guy like Dr. Oz!

23:21.108 --> 23:22.692
-Dr. Oz is a--
-[bones snapping]

23:24.736 --> 23:28.031
What did Dr. Oz do that was bad?
I never heard.

23:28.115 --> 23:30.367
Give me back my vanity sweats.

23:30.450 --> 23:33.120
I can't. I think you broke my wrist.

23:33.203 --> 23:35.872
Fine! I'll do it myself, Andrew.

23:37.416 --> 23:39.376
They're caught on the shoes.

23:39.459 --> 23:40.752
[grunts]

23:40.836 --> 23:43.547
Please. Please just take them.
Take the shoes!

23:43.630 --> 23:47.426
I can't believe you stole my sweats
on top of everything else!

23:48.718 --> 23:49.678
Oh!

23:50.137 --> 23:52.389
We're free. It's finally over.

23:52.472 --> 23:54.891
[groaning] My wrist is broken!

23:54.975 --> 23:58.228
Andrew!
Where'd you put the large scissors?

23:58.311 --> 24:00.647
We are so glad you're okay, Nickie.

24:00.730 --> 24:03.316
You're lucky Judd was around
when you sneezed into that wasp's nest.

24:03.400 --> 24:04.734
What a good big brother.

24:04.818 --> 24:07.320
-I'm mesmerized by you, Judd.
-Nope.

24:07.404 --> 24:10.073
I get it.
Not everyone's a cuddle-bug like me.

24:10.157 --> 24:11.992
-Sleep tight, Nickie.
-Sleep tight, Nick-Nick.

24:12.075 --> 24:12.993
-Hey, Judd?
-Yeah?

24:13.076 --> 24:14.536
Thanks for taking care of me.

24:14.619 --> 24:17.080
I thought I was alone,
but then then you were there.

24:17.164 --> 24:19.249
No big deal.
You're never alone, buddy.

24:19.332 --> 24:22.752
Like I said,
I was training a battalion of raccoons...

24:22.836 --> 24:26.756
-so that you'd never be alone again.
-What?

24:27.674 --> 24:30.969
Hey guys... He's the garbage!

24:31.052 --> 24:32.554
[evil laughter]

24:32.637 --> 24:34.264
[raccoons growling]

24:34.347 --> 24:35.348
[Nick] Judd?

24:35.682 --> 24:37.267
Judd!

24:37.350 --> 24:39.186
[screaming]

24:40.061 --> 24:41.688
[car door opens]

24:50.030 --> 24:52.491
-[Shadow Wizard] Was it worth it, Jessi?
-[gasps]

24:52.782 --> 24:55.535
-Just to get hella faded?
-No.

24:55.619 --> 25:00.290
Your sweet sad father thought
he was going to win your mother back.

25:00.373 --> 25:02.209
-Do you think that'd happen now?
-No.

25:02.292 --> 25:03.210
Yes...

25:03.335 --> 25:07.172
It appears those good old days
are gone forever.

25:07.255 --> 25:09.216
Oh! They look so happy.

25:09.633 --> 25:11.635
[Shame Wizard]
They do. What a shame.

25:11.718 --> 25:13.011
[Jessi] I came along...

25:13.094 --> 25:15.055
I never should have been born.

25:15.138 --> 25:16.890
Oh! Now that's interesting.

25:16.973 --> 25:18.892
[crying]
This whole thing is my fault.

25:18.975 --> 25:19.935
Oh, yes.

25:20.018 --> 25:22.896
Also, you should have been more aggressive

25:22.979 --> 25:25.482
volunteering for Hillary Clinton.

25:25.565 --> 25:27.567
If you made a few more phone calls...

25:27.984 --> 25:29.444
-Who knows.
-[sighs]

25:29.528 --> 25:30.695
It's true.

25:30.946 --> 25:32.697
It's so true.
