00:01.000 --> 00:03.936
McFumbles here with
a question of grave importance--

00:04.037 --> 00:06.705
who's ready for Tex Fest?!

00:06.806 --> 00:08.874
     - That's right cowboys
          and cowgirls,

00:08.975 --> 00:11.210
      it's the festival to
   celebrate our great state.

00:11.311 --> 00:13.679
     This Friday we're gonna
      Texas until it hurts.

00:13.780 --> 00:16.515
    We'll sing. We'll dance.

00:16.616 --> 00:18.183
   We'll deep fry everything.

00:18.284 --> 00:20.586
    I'm so excited, I hitched
     a ride with this fella.

00:22.489 --> 00:24.390
             - Hey!

00:24.491 --> 00:26.625
    Riding a horse in school?

00:26.726 --> 00:28.827
  Ho, ho, that means detention.

00:28.928 --> 00:30.896
 - You've gotta catch me first!

00:30.997 --> 00:32.998
            Yee-haw!

00:39.305 --> 00:41.407
  I will see you in detention.

00:44.010 --> 00:45.744
    - ♪ Dreamlike, teamlike ♪

00:45.845 --> 00:48.180
 ♪ Livin' like one of the boys ♪

00:50.617 --> 00:56.188
               - ♪

00:56.289 --> 00:59.358
   - Funnel cakes, kettle corn
     and foot-long churros.

00:59.459 --> 01:02.861
     There's only one thing
 that can make Tex Fest sweeter.

01:02.962 --> 01:06.265
      And there they are--
           excuse me.

01:06.366 --> 01:08.133
 - Troy, you do know those girls

01:08.234 --> 01:10.102
       are signing up for
     the choir performance.

01:10.203 --> 01:12.304
           - Uh, yeah.

01:12.405 --> 01:14.306
   - And you do know you have
       to sing in a choir.

01:14.407 --> 01:16.375
Oh, Sophie!

01:16.476 --> 01:20.112
   Choir isn't about singing.

01:20.213 --> 01:22.915
       They need guys for
    the Tex Fest performance.

01:23.016 --> 01:24.283
     This is another chance
          for The Troy

01:24.384 --> 01:26.251
to hang with some lovely ladies.

01:26.352 --> 01:31.857
- Um, I believe you already hang
  out with three lovely ladies.

01:31.958 --> 01:33.559
     - No, we just hang out
         with you guys.

01:33.660 --> 01:35.894
         Pay attention.

01:35.995 --> 01:41.300
Who's with me for "Operation
 Acquire  the Ladies?"

01:41.401 --> 01:43.102
    - Sorry, I'd love to go.

01:43.203 --> 01:45.971
     But I've got somethin'
       way bigger planned.

01:46.072 --> 01:47.306
             - Newt?

01:47.407 --> 01:49.074
      - I've never sung in
        front of people--

01:49.175 --> 01:51.043
   let alone all of Tex Fest.

01:51.144 --> 01:52.377
     That sounds terrifying.

01:52.479 --> 01:54.646
         - Come on, bro.
     You can be my wing man.

01:54.747 --> 01:56.982
        I promise I'll be
  by your side the whole time.

01:57.083 --> 01:58.283
         - I don't know.

01:58.384 --> 01:59.952
       - Aw, it's too bad.

02:00.053 --> 02:02.788
  I heard Sophie likes singers.

02:02.889 --> 02:03.989
            - I'm in!

02:04.090 --> 02:07.659
      Outta my way, Becky!

02:07.760 --> 02:09.394
            - My man!

02:09.496 --> 02:11.597
 - Sawyer, you're signing up for
 the Hot Pepper Eating Contest?

02:11.698 --> 02:13.098
          - You betcha.

02:13.199 --> 02:14.933
       I've always dreamed
       about bringing home

02:15.034 --> 02:16.535
    the Flaming Tongue award.

02:16.636 --> 02:19.271
       - And I'm going to
       crush that dream...

02:19.372 --> 02:23.175
   into a million tiny pieces.

02:23.276 --> 02:25.377
   - Why do I get the feeling
        this is personal?

02:25.478 --> 02:28.280
        - Because it is.
     You know what you did.

02:31.684 --> 02:34.453
               Oh!

02:34.554 --> 02:35.521
        - Got ya, Gerry!

02:35.622 --> 02:37.856
         Wait, I thought
    that was Gerry's locker.

02:37.957 --> 02:39.925
             - No...

02:40.026 --> 02:42.261
         it's my locker.

02:42.362 --> 02:44.930
     - Great. Now I've gotta
      do it all over again.

02:48.067 --> 02:50.169
        Payback's comin'
        for you, Huggins.

02:50.270 --> 02:51.637
And it's coming in hot.

02:51.738 --> 02:56.074
Bring it, de la Rosa.

02:56.176 --> 02:58.377
Hmph!

02:58.478 --> 03:01.547
   - Such a festive time, huh?

03:01.648 --> 03:03.115
      Looks like everyone's
          off planning

03:03.216 --> 03:06.418
    for Tex Fest but us, Pep.
          - Actually...

03:06.519 --> 03:08.720
   You know those short videos
      I posted on my blog?

03:08.821 --> 03:11.590
   - Of course. "Mr. Armadillo
       Meets Miss Cactus."

03:11.691 --> 03:13.825
           So moving.

03:13.927 --> 03:16.562
   - Well, one of the festival
   organizers saw them and...

03:16.663 --> 03:18.997
      they want me to make
     the video for Tex Fest!

03:19.098 --> 03:21.066
    - Pepper, that's amazing!

03:21.167 --> 03:23.402
      - It has to be about
      a trailblazing Texan,

03:23.503 --> 03:25.304
   so I chose Miriam Ferguson,

03:25.405 --> 03:27.139
        the first female
       governor of Texas.

03:27.240 --> 03:29.074
    She broke down barriers--
         just like you,

03:29.175 --> 03:31.043
   doing a job that previously

03:31.144 --> 03:32.811
       had only been done
        by stinky boys--

03:32.912 --> 03:34.613
         just like you.

03:34.714 --> 03:37.082
 So I'm thinking the part should
     be played by someone...

03:37.183 --> 03:38.984
         - Just like me?

03:39.085 --> 03:40.886
     - Well, if you insist.

03:40.987 --> 03:42.487
             - I do.

03:42.589 --> 03:44.856
  I can't believe we're making
       the Tex Fest video.

03:44.958 --> 03:46.625
     - This is huge for me!

03:46.726 --> 03:48.360
     My parents keep saying
          my videos are

03:48.461 --> 03:51.964
  "Just another hobby that I'll
   probably lose interest in."

03:52.065 --> 03:54.766
 But this is my chance to prove
  to them it's more than that.

03:54.867 --> 03:56.802
    - Pepper, you're the most
      creative girl I know.

03:56.903 --> 04:00.639
You're going to prove it to your
   parents and our whole town.

04:00.740 --> 04:02.674
            - Thanks.

04:04.777 --> 04:07.312
You're thinking of the armadillo
   and the cactus, aren't you?

04:07.413 --> 04:10.549
        - He hugged her,
    even though it hurt him.

So, welcome Troy and Newt.

I've just been elected the first
    female governor of Texas.

10:38.671 --> 10:41.973

         check this out.

             Ahhhh!

10:44.744 --> 10:45.910

10:46.012 --> 10:48.279

        gettin' so tough,

10:48.381 --> 10:51.516

    tastes like fruit punch.

And now I've
    got to go to the bathroom

10:53.953 --> 10:56.054

       unrelated reasons!

10:58.324 --> 11:01.126

 only have Tex Fest once a year.

      and left her hanging?

11:05.731 --> 11:08.566
     Sorry, Bella, but what
    you did was kinda harsh.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.535
       - I feel terrible.

11:10.636 --> 11:13.071

    ruining her movie anyway.

      found a replacement.

11:28.487 --> 11:30.255

   Just dropping off supplies.

11:30.356 --> 11:32.223

      the corn booth again.

11:33.859 --> 11:35.727
       - Oh, uh, she's not
       doing it any more.

11:35.828 --> 11:37.796
   She withdrew this morning.
           - She did?

11:37.897 --> 11:39.764
     - Yeah, it was too late
      to find a replacement

11:39.865 --> 11:41.766
         for you and Ace
     just wasn't convincing.

11:41.867 --> 11:46.137

      - No, as a governor.

11:46.238 --> 11:47.806

11:47.907 --> 11:49.908
        - No, no, Bella,
      don't worry about it.

11:50.009 --> 11:52.110
 This video was just another one
 of Pepper's passing interests.

11:52.211 --> 11:55.146

    But that's our Pepperoni.
