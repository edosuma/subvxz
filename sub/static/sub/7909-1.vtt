00:32.899 --> 00:36.391
Here's what's going to happen.
I'm going to read this...

00:36.703 --> 00:39.797
And you're going to listen, and
you're going to stay on the line.

00:39.906 --> 00:43.501
You're not going to interrupt. You're
not going to speak for any reason.

00:43.610 --> 00:47.376
Now, some of this you know. I'm going
to start at the top of the page.

00:50.016 --> 00:54.316
Meticulous, yes.
Methodical. Educated.

00:54.421 --> 00:56.389
They were these things.

00:56.489 --> 00:59.014
Nothing extreme. Like
anyone, they varied.

00:59.125 --> 01:03.289
There were days of mistakes
and laziness and infighting.

01:03.797 --> 01:07.665
And there were days, good days,
when by anyone's judgment...

01:08.001 --> 01:10.367
They would have to be
considered clever.

01:10.537 --> 01:13.768
No one would say that what they
were doing was complicated.

01:14.074 --> 01:18.443
It wouldn't even be considered new.
Except maybe in the geological sense.

01:18.812 --> 01:21.508
They took from their
surroundings what was needed...

01:21.614 --> 01:23.275
And made of it something more.

01:23.383 --> 01:27.012
- We haven't even set up an appointment.
- What order date did you put on this?

01:27.120 --> 01:30.283
- The 28th. Why?
- I don't know... yeah, I'm putting 28th.

01:30.390 --> 01:34.656
Have you thought any more about
what you want to put forward?

01:36.396 --> 01:38.762
- Not really.
- Because I was...

01:38.865 --> 01:41.561
I mean I haven't changed
my mind or anything.

01:41.668 --> 01:45.604
Phillip and I were talking, and we
think it could be good. It'd be fun.

01:48.441 --> 01:50.204
Nobody's saying it
wouldn't be fun.

01:50.310 --> 01:54.371
The time for jacking around with Tesla coils
and ball lightning in the garage is over.

01:54.481 --> 01:57.075
Maybe you should try it on
your own in your free time.

01:57.183 --> 02:00.243
My free time? The free time after
the 50 hours a week at work...

02:00.353 --> 02:04.346
Or after the 30 hours of free time
i already spend in that garage?

02:04.757 --> 02:06.748
And it's not a Tesla coil.

02:06.860 --> 02:09.419
I could save a few minutes a
day by eating on the toilet.

02:09.529 --> 02:12.225
How many patents do we have?
In the last 14 months?

02:12.332 --> 02:15.233
- Did you sign the agreement?
- Nobody signed the agreement.

02:15.335 --> 02:17.462
Doesn't matter, we're
sticking to the agreement.

02:17.570 --> 02:20.698
Name one thing out of that garage
that's remotely profitable.

02:20.807 --> 02:24.140
I don't see anybody quitting their
jobs because of it. Are you?

02:24.244 --> 02:26.906
Abe just means that right
now the jtag cards are it.

02:27.013 --> 02:31.313
When you look at the addresses, we have a
lot of apartments. A lot of residences.

02:31.417 --> 02:34.443
But these are not the bulk orders
to the oems or retail giants.

02:34.554 --> 02:36.749
- These are the quiet basement...
- Hackers.

02:36.856 --> 02:40.292
Yeah, hacker wannabes testing
their dads' old motherboards.

02:41.528 --> 02:45.464
And I know that a lot of that is
my fault, admittedly, you know.

02:45.698 --> 02:49.964
With everything last year, and the
doubletalk we were getting from platts...

02:50.069 --> 02:53.732
- And all the stuff we won't get into now...
- We should get into it.

02:54.607 --> 02:56.097
I'm sorry. What?

02:57.844 --> 02:59.641
Go ahead. Tell him.

03:01.047 --> 03:03.572
We should get into it. I
talked to my brother today.

03:03.683 --> 03:06.243
He knows of two other cases
like that at his firm.

03:06.352 --> 03:09.549
- Let platts know that we're talking about it.
- Look, forget platts.

03:09.656 --> 03:13.148
This has got to be about what has the
best chance of going to market...

03:13.259 --> 03:15.489
And what is going to
get us vc attention.

03:15.595 --> 03:18.962
Look, I stuck by you guys
when it was your turn.

03:19.065 --> 03:21.863
And I wasn't 100% sure
of what we were doing...

03:21.968 --> 03:24.266
Or even if I didn't
agree, maybe.

03:25.505 --> 03:27.632
But if it's my turn...

03:27.874 --> 03:31.605
If we're still playing by the rules,
then this is what I want to try.

03:34.814 --> 03:37.146
Here, take it. They said
it wouldn't hold a freeze.

03:37.250 --> 03:39.377
Robert, please. It's
not going to hold.

03:39.485 --> 03:42.750
- It's going to go bad in my car.
- It'll go bad here. Okay, thanks.

03:42.855 --> 03:44.550
- Good night, all.
- See you.

03:47.227 --> 03:50.890
- We just got done giving this huge speech...
- We gave the speech?

03:50.997 --> 03:53.022
We just got done. It
was five minutes ago.

03:53.132 --> 03:57.899
I'm the one that forced the issue. They're
onto us because I suck as the bad cop.

03:58.004 --> 04:01.371
- You should do it. You could fake it better.
- I don't know about that.

04:01.474 --> 04:04.841
As long as we're going down this road
where it's eighth grade physics...

04:04.944 --> 04:08.402
And happy fun time out in that garage,
i think we could stand to try this.

04:08.514 --> 04:11.540
Phillip and Robert are gung ho
on theirs, and that's fine.

04:11.651 --> 04:13.949
But you know I have
no interest in that.

04:14.053 --> 04:16.385
I know you have no interest,
besides the fact...

04:16.488 --> 04:20.322
That Phillip and Robert don't even need
us. They just want to use the equipment.

04:20.426 --> 04:22.758
For what I want to do?
We don't need them.

04:22.862 --> 04:25.660
Not even Phillip, because
it doesn't need software.

04:26.399 --> 04:29.232
- Is she asleep?
- No, and she needs a bath.

04:29.636 --> 04:33.003
- She'll wind up in the closet if I do it.
- That's fine.

04:33.906 --> 04:36.739
You know, even if Robert's
okay with it, and he won't be.

04:36.843 --> 04:41.246
- I don't understand what that thing will do.
- We'll let them go at it for two months.

04:41.347 --> 04:44.043
- They do theirs, we do ours.
- They said it'd take 14 hours.

04:44.150 --> 04:46.243
Don't eat that.
Seriously, it's bad.

04:46.352 --> 04:48.820
We threw the first couple
of batches out. The filter.

04:48.921 --> 04:50.616
What about crushed?

04:52.025 --> 04:53.549
These guys are funded.

04:53.826 --> 04:56.989
- These guys are... what?
- Liquid helium. These guys are funded.

04:57.096 --> 04:58.723
That's what this is.

04:58.831 --> 05:01.163
That's the whole difference.
That's what the box is.

05:01.267 --> 05:04.395
We don't have to play the game where
we're going back and forth...

05:04.504 --> 05:08.440
Coming up with innovative ways to make
it colder and unusable in the process.

05:08.541 --> 05:11.704
- Aaron, I need the hexagonal set.
- This is unmarketable.

05:11.811 --> 05:14.507
By coming at it from the back
end, rather than changing...

05:14.614 --> 05:17.777
The surrounding temperature, we'll
change the level it'll conduct...

05:17.884 --> 05:20.717
The transition temperature. And
by bombarding these edges...

05:20.820 --> 05:24.017
They're dropping the ceramic, the
temperature lower and lower.

05:24.123 --> 05:27.923
It makes the ceramic less resistant and
knocks out the interior magnetic field.

05:28.027 --> 05:30.757
What I'm saying is we
drop the box down on it.

05:31.331 --> 05:34.664
Focus our own magnetic field to
negate, knock out with the inverse...

05:34.767 --> 05:36.632
What's going on
inside the ceramic.

05:36.736 --> 05:40.763
That should change the transition
temperature to something we can work with.

05:40.873 --> 05:44.309
- What are we saying that is?
- Hopefully, near room temperature.

05:45.578 --> 05:48.274
What is that about? The best
mathematician is a lazy one?

05:48.381 --> 05:51.111
- What did you ask for?
- I asked. I need the hexagonal set.

05:51.217 --> 05:52.878
- What did you call it?
- Just come on.

05:52.985 --> 05:54.748
- Are these type one?
- The superconductors?

05:54.854 --> 05:56.515
Yeah, they're type one.

05:56.622 --> 05:58.249
Is that going to be a problem?

05:58.358 --> 06:01.225
There's plenty lying around at
work, but they're all bar coded.

06:01.327 --> 06:04.922
- Lf I have to, I'll buy the kits.
- What are you doing about the source?

06:05.031 --> 06:06.362
What?

06:07.066 --> 06:10.001
- I can get them.
- You can... are you sure?

06:10.103 --> 06:11.900
I thought you didn't
like this idea.

06:12.004 --> 06:14.973
Buy them if you have to. Everything
else we can take care of.

06:15.074 --> 06:16.439
What about the source here?

06:16.542 --> 06:19.067
You know that story about
how NASA spent millions...

06:19.178 --> 06:22.978
Developing this pen that writes in
zero-g? Did you ever read that?

06:23.082 --> 06:26.518
- And how Russia solved the problem?
- Yeah, they used a pencil.

06:26.819 --> 06:28.719
Right, a normal wooden pencil.

06:29.589 --> 06:32.717
It just seems like Phillip takes
the NASA route almost every time.

06:32.825 --> 06:35.487
- Palladium?
- You've got their diagram, what does it say?

06:35.595 --> 06:37.529
They use a ratio of
platinum and palladium.

06:37.630 --> 06:39.598
That's not necessary
with the changes I made.

06:39.699 --> 06:41.963
They're just showing off.
If you have it, use it.

06:42.068 --> 06:43.535
I want to get a
replacement router.

06:43.636 --> 06:46.730
- I'm putting down four ounces of palladium.
- Did Robert look at it?

06:46.839 --> 06:48.602
- I already got his.
- I can't fix it.

06:48.708 --> 06:52.371
- Okay. Where are you getting it?
- Wal-Mart. It's $50.

06:52.712 --> 06:55.374
- Okay. Can you get a receipt, please?
- Yeah.

06:55.481 --> 06:57.711
Wait, platinum or palladium
is less resistant?

06:57.817 --> 06:59.876
- Abe? It's not a...
- Yeah, I don't care.

06:59.986 --> 07:02.477
- So resistance doesn't matter.
- I need an aye or a yes.

07:02.588 --> 07:04.613
- Did you jiggle the...
- The collet nut?

07:04.724 --> 07:07.454
- Robert did it.
- Well, yes. I guess.

07:07.994 --> 07:11.395
- Well, then, which is cheaper?
- You're not going to buy it, are you?

07:11.497 --> 07:14.864
Well, unless you've got a few
grams of palladium lying around.

07:15.401 --> 07:18.131
Why would they put it in
there if you didn't need it?

07:18.237 --> 07:20.296
One catalytic
converter. It's fine.

07:20.406 --> 07:23.068
Remember to put it back. Your
emission just went up 300%.

07:23.176 --> 07:25.076
- Is there enough in here?
- Yeah, should be.

07:25.178 --> 07:29.046
If not, we'll pull the one out of
my truck. Okay, copper tubing.

07:36.556 --> 07:39.821
- This will be out of commission, right?
- Without the tubing?

07:40.760 --> 07:43.991
- We can use the freon, too.
- No, it's going to be room temperature.

07:44.096 --> 07:45.154
I know, just in case.

07:45.264 --> 07:49.291
No, wait. Stop. I'll just buy the
tubing. This isn't saving us money.

07:55.208 --> 07:58.268
- Jay? Hey, man. How are you?
- Good.

08:19.932 --> 08:22.093
Should we be wearing goggles?

08:24.470 --> 08:26.665
- Should we be wearing goggles?
- What?

08:26.772 --> 08:29.036
Goggles. Should we
be wearing goggles?

08:36.349 --> 08:38.783
Wait. Phillip, you don't
want to come out here.

08:38.885 --> 08:41.080
Phillip, grab a mask, okay?

09:21.928 --> 09:24.396
It is, though, right?
It's not just me?

09:24.497 --> 09:29.127
No, it's definitely smaller, but it just
seems that way. Take what they have.

09:29.835 --> 09:32.269
Minus the coolant
which we don't need.

09:32.772 --> 09:34.865
The rest of it is
the Mercury bath...

09:34.974 --> 09:39.240
Which you would know better than I do,
but they're probably just showing off.

09:39.946 --> 09:44.144
I mean, you have it, you
got to use it, right?

09:45.051 --> 09:47.451
- What? Does it hurt?
- No, I didn't feel anything.

09:47.553 --> 09:49.851
That sound is just
weirding me out.

09:55.528 --> 09:57.553
- What does it feel like?
- I don't know.

09:57.663 --> 09:59.824
I don't know if
I'm making it up.

10:01.033 --> 10:02.295
Here.

10:16.649 --> 10:19.447
- Next part. Let's do the next part.
- Yeah.

10:27.460 --> 10:30.793
Isn't there some sort of
glass or a transparent...

10:30.896 --> 10:33.456
Anything we can use
as a window? Pyrex?

10:33.566 --> 10:35.193
- Yeah, I'm in.
- Okay, drop it.

10:35.301 --> 10:38.361
I don't know of anything that
won't leave a gap in the field.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.462
But we got to see what's
going on in there.

10:40.573 --> 10:43.235
- How much did that cost?
- Yeah.

10:44.176 --> 10:46.872
- What?
- You want to put my camcorder...

10:46.979 --> 10:50.506
Inside the box that's so
dangerous we can't look into it.

10:53.986 --> 10:56.819
If something happens,
would you pay me back?

10:58.224 --> 11:01.716
So we have a slightly
negative pressure in the box.

11:01.994 --> 11:03.859
So we're ready for the argon.

11:04.597 --> 11:08.158
- Which one is that?
- It's the blue one.

11:08.668 --> 11:12.035
I weighed it at 77 grams.

11:12.171 --> 11:14.401
I set the scale to
decagrams, though.

11:14.940 --> 11:18.398
I'm showing 7.7 decagrams.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.275
Ready for...

11:21.814 --> 11:26.183
0.05 liters of argon.

11:34.794 --> 11:37.262
- You ready?
- Just the plate first, right?

11:37.363 --> 11:40.264
Right, first just the
plate, and then we'll...

11:45.805 --> 11:47.602
Let's just give it a second.

12:05.958 --> 12:08.051
- You want to do the box now?
- Yeah.

12:08.227 --> 12:10.889
Let's go through the checklist.
Aaron, hold on a second.

12:10.996 --> 12:14.693
Let's make sure everything's set
up right. Hold on, Aaron. Wait.

12:16.469 --> 12:17.902
Just wait.

12:29.181 --> 12:30.512
Okay.

12:39.992 --> 12:41.391
Anything?

12:42.595 --> 12:44.790
- Is this normal?
- I don't know.

12:46.031 --> 12:48.124
- I'm turning it off.
- Wait! No.

12:51.570 --> 12:54.971
- Okay, I didn't do that.
- Did we blow something?

12:56.942 --> 13:00.070
Yeah, we did. That's destroyed.

13:00.746 --> 13:03.408
- You want to check your camera?
- Yeah.

13:03.849 --> 13:05.783
- Let's get this.
- You ready?

13:05.951 --> 13:08.215
One, two, three.

13:21.467 --> 13:24.994
Hey. Tell me you're hungry. Kara's
at her mom's and I'm starving.

13:25.437 --> 13:27.530
Yeah, I'm hungry. What...

13:27.640 --> 13:31.804
Abe, it's 7:00. Abe,
it's 7:00 at night.

13:31.977 --> 13:34.309
- Okay, yeah, I have food...
- Okay.

13:34.413 --> 13:37.780
- Wait, are those kids there?
- Just a sec.

13:38.851 --> 13:40.250
Yeah, they're here.

13:40.352 --> 13:44.118
Okay, screw that, let's just go somewhere.
I just pulled in, so come on down.

13:44.223 --> 13:47.283
Come up first. I have some stuff
i want to take back to the shop.

13:47.393 --> 13:49.520
All right, but meet
me at the door.

13:49.628 --> 13:52.791
- Okay, all right.
- Seriously, meet me at the door.

13:52.932 --> 13:54.832
Okay. All right. See you.

14:08.948 --> 14:11.314
- What's up, Abe?
- Hey, Brad. How are you?

14:11.550 --> 14:12.642
Good.

14:22.928 --> 14:25.692
- How long did he say he would be there?
- Not long.

14:25.798 --> 14:28.824
If he's got problems, he's got
to fix them. You're not his dad.

14:28.934 --> 14:32.563
I know. I just thought it would be
good to do something charitable.

14:32.671 --> 14:35.469
It definitely is charity.
At least you admit that.

14:38.277 --> 14:41.508
You feel like a steak? To eat.

14:42.448 --> 14:45.884
I don't want a steak. Let's just grab
some tacos on the way to the shop.

14:45.985 --> 14:47.919
- I have some stuff I want to try out.
- Okay.

14:48.020 --> 14:52.013
We can get some tacos on the way,
or we can get a steak afterwards.

14:52.124 --> 14:55.389
What are you talking about?
I'm not paying for a steak.

15:00.199 --> 15:01.723
It's stable?

15:03.502 --> 15:05.402
Aaron, it's stable?

15:13.345 --> 15:16.041
- What did you do to this thing?
- What?

15:16.415 --> 15:20.010
- It looks like a dog digested it.
- Okay, that's the plate.

15:20.753 --> 15:23.551
I rigged this into the box
so I could control the feed.

15:23.656 --> 15:26.750
- I figured it's the easiest way...
- It's just controlling the box.

15:26.859 --> 15:30.693
The plate stays the same. What
you do is you gradually feed it.

15:34.700 --> 15:37.396
Okay. You hear that? How it's...

15:37.503 --> 15:40.836
See, I'm not touching it anymore.
It's growing with its own momentum.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.500
It's like a feedback loop, and
it just regulates itself.

15:43.609 --> 15:47.375
And what you do is when it gets
there, you bring it back...

15:48.347 --> 15:51.805
And there you go, it coasts.
It's stable. It stays like that.

15:54.586 --> 15:56.019
So it works?

15:56.722 --> 15:59.247
- Yeah, it does.
- What is that, like 10%?

15:59.558 --> 16:02.721
It knocks another couple of points
by the time it reaches the peak.

16:02.828 --> 16:05.854
You may want to come over
here and take a look at this.

16:06.031 --> 16:07.623
Okay, what am I looking at?

16:07.733 --> 16:11.032
- What are we pulling out of the batteries?
- Probably 24 volts.

16:11.136 --> 16:13.502
- I mean, no more than that, right?
- Okay.

16:13.605 --> 16:15.300
So your meter's jacked up.

16:15.774 --> 16:19.574
That's what I figured. So I tried three
others. I got the exact same thing.

16:19.678 --> 16:21.509
- I spent all last night...
- What was it?

16:21.613 --> 16:25.344
I spent last night and a two-hour break
just double-checking everything.

16:25.451 --> 16:29.444
There's something wrong here. We're not
pulling out more than we're putting in.

16:29.555 --> 16:31.785
- Slightly more.
- Well, yeah, whatever.

16:31.890 --> 16:34.791
It's not like a volt and a half
more than we're putting in.

16:34.893 --> 16:38.852
It's probably the batteries. They're
cheap batteries, not regulated right.

16:39.098 --> 16:40.656
That is weird, though.

16:43.969 --> 16:46.062
You want to see
something weirder?

16:46.372 --> 16:50.240
Okay, let's go over this again.
Two batteries, right? 24 volts?

16:51.110 --> 16:54.204
What are we pulling out of
this one? Just for fun.

16:56.915 --> 16:58.405
Twelve volts.

17:08.394 --> 17:11.921
- How about this one?
- Should be 12 volts.

17:20.705 --> 17:22.696
So, what the hell is this thing?

17:23.909 --> 17:25.877
It doesn't stay like that.

17:26.712 --> 17:29.545
No, it winds down in a few
minutes. What does that?

17:34.553 --> 17:38.546
I don't know. I'll tell them something.
I'll tell them we're spraying for bugs.

17:38.657 --> 17:41.023
It should just be a
day or two, anyways.

17:41.427 --> 17:45.420
- Unless you want to bring them in.
- No, they have their work in there, too.

17:45.531 --> 17:48.694
If Phillip finds out about that he's
going to have to take it apart.

17:48.801 --> 17:53.204
- No. I'm just putting a little tweak on it.
- Yeah, I know. No, you're right.

17:53.806 --> 17:57.242
Abe, it's my garage, okay? It's
not like they're paying rent.

17:57.743 --> 18:01.839
There was value in the thing. Clearly.
Of that they were certain of.

18:01.947 --> 18:04.279
But what is the application?
In a matter of hours...

18:04.383 --> 18:07.875
They had pinned it to everything from
mass transit to satellite launching.

18:07.986 --> 18:10.181
Imagining devices the
size of jumbo jets.

18:10.289 --> 18:13.349
Everything would be cheaper. It
was practical and they knew it.

18:13.459 --> 18:15.518
But above all that,
beyond the positives...

18:15.627 --> 18:17.788
They knew that the easiest
way to be exploited...

18:17.896 --> 18:20.160
Is to sell something they
did not yet understand.

18:20.265 --> 18:23.723
So they kept quiet. The
parties would continue.

18:23.836 --> 18:26.396
Any birthday,
anniversary, holiday...

18:26.505 --> 18:30.441
Maybe some obscure project launch. It
didn't matter. Any reason would do.

18:30.609 --> 18:35.012
What was important is that Thomas Granger,
their last best hope of funding, show up.

18:35.114 --> 18:39.483
If he left a little earlier than they
would've liked, he couldn't be blamed.

18:39.585 --> 18:42.611
He was only there to please
his daughter Rachel.

18:42.721 --> 18:45.281
And she was only
there to please Abe.

18:47.726 --> 18:49.785
What did you say to Mr.
Granger a while ago?

18:49.895 --> 18:52.659
- Did you flip my burger?
- You can't call him Mr. Granger.

18:52.764 --> 18:54.925
You have to call him, like,
Thomas or something.

18:55.033 --> 18:57.934
- Go ahead.
- No, because he won't take you seriously.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.732
- He thinks we're kids.
- Lf you call him Mr. Granger...

19:01.840 --> 19:06.573
He looks at you like you're a 6-year-old kid.
He does it with me. It won't work anymore.

19:06.845 --> 19:10.474
Abe had taken on the task of
quantifying and explaining the device.

19:11.450 --> 19:13.315
But as weeks became months...

19:13.418 --> 19:17.718
Their enthusiasm became a slow realization
that they were out of their depth.

20:00.566 --> 20:02.864
There he is. I've been
calling you all morning.

20:02.968 --> 20:05.994
- Where'd you call?
- Your work and your cell.

20:06.772 --> 20:08.239
I'm not there.

20:09.408 --> 20:10.602
Really?

20:12.578 --> 20:15.547
- March madness?
- It's Carolina and Michigan.

20:15.647 --> 20:17.774
- Who's up?
- I don't even know what.

20:19.284 --> 20:21.411
Do you have anything
important at work today?

20:21.520 --> 20:25.456
I hope you're not implying that any
day is unimportant at cortex semi.

20:26.892 --> 20:30.259
I was going to come give you this
big speech about how we've been...

20:30.362 --> 20:33.331
Friends for a long time and built
up trust, that whole thing.

20:33.432 --> 20:35.059
But how about this instead?

20:35.167 --> 20:39.365
If you ditch work this afternoon and promise
to do the few small things I ask you...

20:39.471 --> 20:42.201
I will in return show you
the most important thing...

20:42.307 --> 20:44.969
That any living organism
has ever witnessed.

20:46.011 --> 20:49.469
Well, it looks like
mustard to me.

20:49.581 --> 20:51.913
I know, but it's a film.
It's a protein...

20:52.017 --> 20:54.918
Secreted by a fungus
called aspergillus ticor.

20:55.020 --> 20:56.044
He told you that?

20:56.154 --> 20:59.123
No, he knew it was a protein but
didn't know where it came from.

20:59.224 --> 21:02.387
All he really did was just take
some pictures with their equipment.

21:02.494 --> 21:03.825
Guess where we're going.

21:03.929 --> 21:06.295
- Do you know where will is?
- No, why?

21:06.398 --> 21:08.730
The Ariel meeting is pushed
back till Wednesday.

21:08.834 --> 21:11.598
I thought he was waiting around
for it. Where are you going?

21:11.703 --> 21:13.933
What do they do with
engineers when they turn 40?

21:14.039 --> 21:16.439
- What, bradshaw?
- Exactly. You know what?

21:16.541 --> 21:19.442
I do know where will is. I'll
let him know on my way out.

21:19.544 --> 21:21.774
- Okay. Thanks.
- Can you meet me out front?

21:21.880 --> 21:24.974
- You got to drive.
- Okay, here. Take my keys.

21:25.083 --> 21:29.281
Okay, if you can, just pretend that
this is the first time I came in.

21:29.421 --> 21:32.913
And if you would just tell him
exactly what you told me...

21:33.759 --> 21:37.126
- Okay, so what is it?
- Protein buildup.

21:37.229 --> 21:40.858
- Okay, can you just tell him?
- Protein buildup.

21:41.366 --> 21:44.130
- But what kind?
- Some fungus.

21:44.403 --> 21:47.167
- Some fungus.
- Where did it come from?

21:47.339 --> 21:51.207
- I don't know. You were to take it to the lab.
- Yeah, that's next.

21:51.310 --> 21:54.074
- You were in design, weren't you?
- Yeah.

21:54.446 --> 21:56.004
How did you get over here?

21:56.114 --> 21:59.311
Do you know what they do with
engineers when they turn 40?

21:59.618 --> 22:01.245
They take them out
and shoot them.

22:01.353 --> 22:04.322
What the hell, Abe? You could
have just shown me the pictures.

22:04.423 --> 22:08.086
- I want you to believe it.
- Believe what, the protein?

22:08.327 --> 22:09.988
- I believe you.
- Okay, look...

22:10.095 --> 22:13.531
This guy already thinks it's a joke,
so he may be a little defensive.

22:13.632 --> 22:15.964
Really? Why would he think that?

22:28.680 --> 22:30.113
Please.

22:32.084 --> 22:33.949
Aspergillus ticor.

22:34.553 --> 22:36.680
This is a fungus
that's everywhere.

22:37.356 --> 22:41.622
It's in our bed, our skin, sometimes
even our gi tract. Everywhere.

22:42.661 --> 22:47.030
It's basically the reason you don't leave
things in dark, damp, closed-off places.

22:47.199 --> 22:49.963
Thank you. Do you have
that sample I brought?

22:55.240 --> 22:58.232
There it is. Terger.
T-e-r-g-e-r.

22:59.444 --> 23:02.538
Okay, when I showed you this,
tell him what you thought.

23:05.183 --> 23:08.414
- You thought it was a joke, right?
- It is a joke.

23:09.321 --> 23:11.346
Right, but how did you know?

23:14.459 --> 23:16.791
Will you show him? Please?

23:25.904 --> 23:29.340
This is how I get protein a out of
aspergillus ticor. We sweeten it.

23:29.441 --> 23:32.274
We agitate it. We spin it
around. We sweeten some more.

23:32.377 --> 23:35.608
- Takes about a month.
- To get the same amount I brought in.

23:36.648 --> 23:38.240
To get the same
amount I brought in.

23:38.350 --> 23:40.750
So if it's an Incubator for
fungus, is that valuable?

23:40.852 --> 23:42.649
- That's not what it is.
- Then what is it?

23:42.754 --> 23:46.121
There's another way to secrete that
much protein. Do it naturally.

23:46.224 --> 23:48.454
But that takes a lot longer.

23:48.593 --> 23:53.530
If it has a little moisture and it's left alone,
it'll start secreting and it'll build up...

23:53.632 --> 23:56.032
- And build up, but it takes a long time.
- How long?

23:56.134 --> 23:59.001
- A long time.
- More than a few days? Then how long?

23:59.104 --> 24:01.368
To get the same amount of
protein that we have...

24:01.473 --> 24:03.771
The amount that I was wiping
off every five days...

24:03.875 --> 24:06.070
And five days later it
would accumulate...

24:06.178 --> 24:08.840
He says it would take
about five to six years.

24:11.716 --> 24:13.240
I don't want to
belittle this guy.

24:13.351 --> 24:16.047
So, I said screw it and i
put my watch in there.

24:16.588 --> 24:18.715
- And?
- I want you to do it.

24:19.424 --> 24:22.257
- Where is it? The box?
- I took it back to the shop.

24:24.329 --> 24:27.856
- Wait, digital or old mechanical?
- Exactly. I did both.

24:29.201 --> 24:31.601
- And what?
- I want you to do it.

24:34.272 --> 24:36.536
We thought that we were
degrading gravity, right?

24:36.641 --> 24:38.632
That we were blocking
that information.

24:38.743 --> 24:42.372
I think we're doing more than that. I
think we're blocking more than that.

24:42.481 --> 24:46.611
When you were controlling the feed,
did you notice it was parabolic?

24:46.885 --> 24:50.150
It's important. Parabolas are
important. Here, look at this.

24:51.223 --> 24:52.656
I don't know, Abe.

24:52.757 --> 24:55.385
I'm going to start it up and
let it run for 60 seconds...

24:55.494 --> 24:57.758
With nothing in it.
It's empty this time.

24:57.863 --> 24:58.863
That's 22...

24:58.964 --> 25:01.694
In all the equations that describe
motion and heat and entropy.

25:01.800 --> 25:05.327
In all feynman diagrams what's the one
variable that you can turn negative...

25:05.437 --> 25:07.905
And still get rational
answers for? It's not mass.

25:08.006 --> 25:10.804
Twenty-two hours, 27
minutes in the box.

25:10.909 --> 25:14.208
- It's an odd number.
- That's 1,347 minutes.

25:15.914 --> 25:19.441
- 1,347, man, you got that fast.
- How did you know it's odd?

25:19.551 --> 25:23.612
Because this is it. This is what's going
on. There's an "a" end and a "b" end.

25:23.722 --> 25:26.691
Let's say the a end is 12:00,
and the b end is 12:01.

25:26.791 --> 25:29.692
All right? We start the machine
with the weeble at the a end.

25:29.794 --> 25:32.228
- It travels forward...
- You got to write this down.

25:32.330 --> 25:34.764
- There's nothing to write down.
- I'll write it down.

25:34.866 --> 25:36.925
It travels forward normally
towards the b end.

25:37.035 --> 25:39.469
When it gets there, the feed
runs down parabolically...

25:39.571 --> 25:42.699
Until it should stop, but it curves
back around towards the a end.

25:42.807 --> 25:45.970
When it gets back to the a end...
Curve that around. The weeble...

25:46.077 --> 25:49.410
Has experienced a total of two
minutes, and again it curves...

25:49.514 --> 25:51.641
- Back around. It curves parabolically.
- Right.

25:51.750 --> 25:54.378
It comes back around and it
does this about 1,300 times.

25:54.486 --> 25:56.215
When it finally exits
on the b end...

25:56.321 --> 25:59.154
It's traveled an odd number of
forward and backward trips.

25:59.257 --> 26:02.693
What is so special about 1,300? Why is
it about 1,300? Why isn't it exact?

26:02.794 --> 26:04.853
- This is not empirical.
- Here, give me that.

26:04.963 --> 26:08.763
I don't know why it's not exact. There's
some sort of probability there.

26:08.867 --> 26:11.392
Every time it hits the b
end there's a chance...

26:11.503 --> 26:14.404
A small chance it won't curve
back around towards the a end.

26:14.506 --> 26:18.203
And for some reason, it takes about
1,300 trips before it finally does.

26:18.310 --> 26:21.609
It does have to exit, or else we
wouldn't be able to see it afterwards.

26:21.713 --> 26:23.704
Okay, let's take a look at this.

26:24.382 --> 26:26.680
Twenty-two hours, 14 minutes.

26:30.722 --> 26:33.885
- 1,334 minutes.
- Even.

26:36.261 --> 26:37.990
Enter at the b end.

26:39.965 --> 26:41.694
Exit at the b end.

26:44.703 --> 26:48.104
- I just want you to see it the way I saw it.
- I am trying, okay?

26:48.206 --> 26:50.674
Everything we're putting in
that box comes ungrounded.

26:50.775 --> 26:53.539
And I don't mean grounded to the
earth, I mean not tethered.

26:53.645 --> 26:56.808
We're blocking whatever keeps it
moving forward, so they flip-flop.

26:56.915 --> 27:00.043
Inside the box, it's like a street,
and both ends are cul-de-sacs.

27:00.151 --> 27:04.144
This isn't frame dragging or wormhole
matching. It's basic mechanics and heat.

27:04.255 --> 27:06.348
This is not mechanics and heat.

27:10.662 --> 27:14.223
- We can publish.
- Yeah, we can publish.

27:14.332 --> 27:16.823
No, I mean we can
really publish.

27:17.636 --> 27:20.002
Aaron, the weeble's
stupid. It can't move.

27:20.105 --> 27:22.699
Even if we were to put the
weeble in at point b...

27:22.807 --> 27:27.506
It's still going to bounce back and forth
until it's kicked out at the b end.

27:31.116 --> 27:32.674
But if it were smart...

27:34.519 --> 27:38.717
It could enter at the b end and exit
at the a end before it flips back.

27:42.727 --> 27:46.857
You're talking about
making a bigger one.

27:48.166 --> 27:51.499
I didn't say anything. You're
the one talking about it.

27:52.971 --> 27:54.529
So, you believe me?

27:56.608 --> 27:57.870
No, I don't.

27:58.043 --> 28:00.409
Come on. Let's go get
a drink or something.

28:05.483 --> 28:07.917
- We're going to have to move it.
- We will.

28:11.322 --> 28:13.790
We need a box big enough for a person
to fit into. As far as turning it on...

28:13.825 --> 28:17.056
I was testing the box. It turns out
over half the rings are redundant.

28:17.162 --> 28:20.620
The inner ring is strong enough on its
own, so it makes the plate smaller.

28:20.732 --> 28:22.825
A lot more is unnecessary.
What we can do...

28:22.934 --> 28:27.234
Is take a lot of these small plates and
surround a container with a web of them.

28:28.506 --> 28:29.768
How small?

28:30.008 --> 28:34.069
It should be accumulative so a lot of
mini-fields equal one big one, right?

28:34.779 --> 28:36.747
Yeah, sum of series,
that makes sense.

28:36.848 --> 28:40.284
What I was going to say is we need to
find a place where we can put it...

28:40.385 --> 28:42.250
And turn it on and it
won't be disturbed.

28:42.353 --> 28:44.446
We could just lock
it in a closet.

28:44.856 --> 28:48.587
Someplace where someone's not going to
go poking around and messing with it.

28:48.693 --> 28:50.354
And climate-controlled.

28:50.995 --> 28:53.395
Yeah, so whatever,
we'll find some place.

28:53.765 --> 28:56.700
So, if we go your route with
what? A bunch of mini-fields?

28:56.801 --> 29:00.532
That's a lot of work. We'd have to...
I mean, how many days is that?

29:01.973 --> 29:05.170
Abe, you know what we could use?

29:06.177 --> 29:09.613
I know we've seen a lot of
crazy things lately, okay?

29:09.714 --> 29:13.650
I know you're still trying to put it all
together in a way that makes sense.

29:13.752 --> 29:17.347
Look, I just want you to understand
that what's next is not a prank, okay?

29:17.455 --> 29:20.219
I wouldn't do that to you and
I'm not doing that to you.

29:20.325 --> 29:24.728
So when you see this, you can't yell
or make any noise or run anywhere.

29:25.363 --> 29:29.322
I know you probably feel like you're being
tricked or made fun of. But you're not.

29:29.434 --> 29:32.301
I promise you, you're not. Okay?

29:58.696 --> 30:00.061
Who was that, Abe?

30:24.923 --> 30:27.153
Let's just wait. Six minutes.

31:28.019 --> 31:30.180
Look, you sure you're
okay to drive?

31:33.791 --> 31:36.453
What did you do all day?
The first time through?

31:39.631 --> 31:42.429
I spent the day in a hotel
room in russellfield.

31:44.269 --> 31:47.500
- I'll just meet you back at the shop.
- I wonder what I did.

31:49.540 --> 31:52.566
- I guess I went back to work.
- Yeah, probably.

31:52.677 --> 31:54.611
Probably just worked, I guess.

31:55.380 --> 31:57.678
Yeah, probably so.

32:01.986 --> 32:04.511
Look, now that I know
about this, Abe...

32:05.123 --> 32:07.956
don't do this again, okay?
Not where it affects me.

32:12.597 --> 32:14.121
Go ahead.

32:19.737 --> 32:21.170
Hey, Rachel.

33:03.514 --> 33:05.175
Why not the lottery?

33:05.550 --> 33:08.280
We can if you want, but
it's not until Saturday.

33:08.386 --> 33:12.914
And even if we win the full $10 million,
that's only $200,000 for the next 30 years.

33:13.891 --> 33:16.758
- And that's just one good trade.
- A couple days like this.

33:16.861 --> 33:20.262
- I was just running a test. In and out.
- I want to do what you did.

33:20.365 --> 33:21.764
Exactly what you did.

33:21.866 --> 33:24.767
- The first thing I did is call in sick.
- Okay, I did that.

33:24.869 --> 33:28.737
- Then I drove to the storage facility.
- But I need to drop Lauren at school first.

33:28.840 --> 33:31.434
Then meet me there. We're
going to need both cars.

33:31.542 --> 33:34.636
We need to park yours down the road,
out of sight of the facility.

33:34.746 --> 33:37.647
- Why are we doing that?
- Because we need a ride home.

33:37.749 --> 33:39.307
- What is that...
- It'll make sense.

33:39.417 --> 33:41.612
Okay, I'll be patient.

33:41.719 --> 33:45.211
When I got to the storage room,
i flooded the box with argon...

33:45.323 --> 33:49.054
And I had to tighten it
up to secure the leaks.

33:49.527 --> 33:52.052
- There's leaks?
- There's always leaks.

33:55.900 --> 34:00.496
At 8:30 A.M., I set the
timer for 15 minutes...

34:00.605 --> 34:04.006
I jumped in the car, and
drove to russellfield.

34:04.208 --> 34:05.368
Okay, I lost it.

34:05.476 --> 34:08.138
- What?
- Why the timer?

34:08.513 --> 34:12.380
Because the moment we start those
machines is the moment we'll end up...

34:12.483 --> 34:15.213
- Getting out of them, and-
- right. Got it. Sorry.

34:15.319 --> 34:18.014
I don't want to be standing
around when they do.

34:19.056 --> 34:23.460
While I was on the road at 8:45,
the machine kicked on by itself...

34:24.495 --> 34:27.623
And by 8:49, it was
completely warmed up.

34:35.406 --> 34:40.002
In russellfield, I got a hotel
room and tried to isolate myself.

34:40.710 --> 34:42.474
Wait, what do you
mean "isolate"?

34:42.580 --> 34:45.275
I closed the windows, I unplugged
everything in the room...

34:45.382 --> 34:47.351
The telephone, TV, clock,
radio, everything.

34:47.452 --> 34:50.444
I didn't want to take the chance
of running into someone I knew...

34:50.554 --> 34:52.523
Or seeing something on
the news that might...

34:52.623 --> 34:56.525
If we're dealing with causality,
and I don't even know for sure.

34:56.627 --> 34:58.822
- I just...
- What?

34:59.230 --> 35:02.393
- Took myself out of the equation.
- Err on the side of caution.

35:02.500 --> 35:03.592
Yes.

35:05.103 --> 35:07.230
Then what did you do all day?

35:10.308 --> 35:13.971
- I just sat there. I had some books, but...
- What? Were you nervous?

35:14.078 --> 35:17.206
Yeah. It's mind-numbing,
all the second-guessing.

35:22.153 --> 35:23.586
"Evacipate."

35:28.726 --> 35:32.253
At 3:30 P.M., I stopped by
Williams medical supply.

35:32.363 --> 35:34.456
Picked up a class e
oxygen tank and mask.

35:34.565 --> 35:38.228
I called my mutual fund company and asked
which stock in their mid-cap fund...

35:38.336 --> 35:40.236
Had the greatest
percentage gain that day.

35:40.338 --> 35:43.307
The idea was just to get enough
information for one good trade.

35:43.407 --> 35:46.103
Can we just download chart data
and trade on each movement?

35:46.210 --> 35:50.647
But if we do that, I want to use the library
in russellfield, use their computers.

36:04.695 --> 36:08.859
So, I got to the storage room at about
3:15 and cut off the power to the box.

36:09.767 --> 36:12.634
It cycled down to a tolerable
level at about 3:19.

36:12.803 --> 36:15.863
The trick is to get in after it
reaches a comfortable level...

36:15.973 --> 36:19.272
But before it shuts off completely.
There's a window there.

36:19.443 --> 36:21.377
So, does it hurt?

36:22.813 --> 36:24.508
Yeah, it does a little.

36:24.882 --> 36:28.511
It's not bad if you wait for the right
time. It's like a small static shock.

36:28.619 --> 36:31.179
- Once you're in, you're fine, though.
- What?

36:31.522 --> 36:34.719
I know you've done it, and I can
only assume that you don't have...

36:34.825 --> 36:36.793
Cancer or male impotence.

36:36.894 --> 36:39.590
But what is your opinion
on how safe this thing is?

36:39.697 --> 36:42.063
I can imagine no way in which
this thing would be...

36:42.166 --> 36:44.293
Considered anywhere
remotely close to safe.

36:44.402 --> 36:47.894
All I know is I spent six hours
in there and I'm still alive.

36:50.508 --> 36:52.408
You still want to do it?

37:09.327 --> 37:12.091
I set the alarm on my
stopwatch for six hours.

37:12.196 --> 37:16.292
I regulated the O2 tank, took some
dramamine, and tried to sleep.

37:16.968 --> 37:18.230
Did you?

37:18.502 --> 37:20.402
- What?
- Did you sleep?

37:20.905 --> 37:24.841
Not at first. I've never considered
myself claustrophobic...

37:24.942 --> 37:29.072
But I started sweating and I couldn't
find the right flow rate on the tank...

37:29.547 --> 37:33.608
And I was breathing differently than I was
when I was testing it on the outside.

37:33.718 --> 37:36.118
Eventually, I settled
down, and...

37:36.487 --> 37:40.446
I don't know, maybe it was the dramamine
kicking in, but I remember this moment...

37:40.558 --> 37:43.356
In the dark with the
reverberation of the machine.

37:43.928 --> 37:46.897
It was maybe the most
content I've ever been.

37:49.634 --> 37:52.000
I woke up on my own
without the alarm...

37:52.103 --> 37:55.595
And waited for the machine to cool
down. Cool down from my perspective.

37:55.706 --> 37:58.573
It got to a point where it
sounded safe to get out...

37:58.676 --> 38:01.236
But the stopwatch still
showed a couple minutes...

38:01.345 --> 38:03.711
So I trusted the
math and waited.

38:39.884 --> 38:43.581
That's not a static shock,
Abe. Okay, please stop it.

38:49.860 --> 38:51.589
You got out too soon.

38:53.030 --> 38:57.057
You have to wait for the stopwatch so
that you know the gain is low enough.

38:57.468 --> 38:59.163
So, we're back here?

38:59.603 --> 39:03.164
Yeah, we're here. It's
8:50, Tuesday morning.

39:07.278 --> 39:09.337
All right. Give
me a few minutes.

39:12.416 --> 39:15.943
From there it was easy. The
bulk of the work was done.

39:16.053 --> 39:19.386
I just left everything the way I found
it. I left the machine alone...

39:19.490 --> 39:22.459
And didn't turn it off, and
just cleared out of there.

39:22.560 --> 39:26.997
So your double would find everything the
same later that day and get in the box?

39:27.098 --> 39:31.626
Right, but also, I or my double or
someone was in the box coming backwards.

39:31.736 --> 39:34.967
So who knows what that would've
done if I'd turned the machine off.

39:35.072 --> 39:37.563
Definitely. So, they're
one-time use only.

39:37.675 --> 39:42.078
So then, at that moment, since my double
was on the way to the hotel in my car...

39:42.179 --> 39:46.206
I had to take a taxi home. But when we
go, we'll be able to use your truck.

40:06.570 --> 40:10.233
- You have a margin account, right?
- Yeah. I do now. What are we buying?

40:10.341 --> 40:14.243
Good. Today, before 12:30, we'll buy
as many shares as we can of rgwu.

40:16.313 --> 40:20.010
They'll say their earnings that quarter
are three and a half times consensus...

40:20.117 --> 40:23.109
And the stock will nearly
double in afternoon trading.

40:25.022 --> 40:27.149
- What do they do?
- What do you mean?

40:27.291 --> 40:29.555
What does this company do?
Do they make things or...

40:29.660 --> 40:32.254
I don't know. All that matters
is the price goes up.

40:32.363 --> 40:37.062
The volume is so high that the number of
shares we trade won't affect the price.

40:39.804 --> 40:41.931
You really don't
know what they do?

40:47.511 --> 40:51.311
That's why you spoke about a mid-cap fund,
so volume is high enough to hide us.

40:51.415 --> 40:53.508
- Do you think it's too cautious?
- I don't know.

40:53.617 --> 40:55.812
I know there's a lot of
other stocks out there...

40:55.920 --> 40:59.117
That do a lot more than double,
but this is my first day.

41:36.760 --> 41:38.591
- My god.
- She's not going to answer.

41:38.762 --> 41:40.457
I know, Abe. That's
the question.

41:41.599 --> 41:45.592
I know, so what's the answer?
You've got the $400 billion...

41:45.703 --> 41:49.298
You've gone the charity route, you
have this perfect 100-room mansion...

41:49.406 --> 41:51.772
With matching his and her
yachts and helicopter pads.

41:51.876 --> 41:54.845
Basically, you have absolute
impunity to do whatever you want...

41:54.945 --> 41:55.945
Nobody can touch you.

41:56.046 --> 41:58.105
- You're back from a two-year...
- Above the law.

41:58.215 --> 42:03.084
Absolutely, well above. You're fresh back
from this two-year world-galloping vacation.

42:03.187 --> 42:05.246
How do you fill your
day? What do you do?

42:05.356 --> 42:09.690
Abe, I know that's the question, but it's
not a real question, so why does it matter?

42:09.793 --> 42:11.192
So what's the answer?

42:11.295 --> 42:15.129
Babe, he knows that's the question,
okay? He's asking you the question.

42:15.533 --> 42:19.094
What do you mean? What would I do with
my life or what would I do tomorrow?

42:19.203 --> 42:20.465
My god, either.

42:22.172 --> 42:26.165
I'd have to do something constructive. I'd
have to do something that would help...

42:26.277 --> 42:29.940
- Something that would make me feel good.
- I know. That's fantastic. Good.

42:30.047 --> 42:34.916
- My wife. So good. So pure. You are pure.
- Shut up. Why did you ask, then?

42:35.152 --> 42:39.350
This is what I would do: I would
wake up tomorrow morning...

42:39.456 --> 42:41.890
And I'd go over to
Gabriel capital inc...

42:41.992 --> 42:45.758
And I would tell Joseph platts'
receptionist that I'm there to see him...

42:45.863 --> 42:47.558
And when he comes out...

42:49.066 --> 42:51.899
I would ram my fist through
the flat of his nose.

42:52.870 --> 42:56.863
Just one good punch,
one good pow.

42:58.409 --> 43:01.606
- That's amazing. It's about time.
- That is so great.

43:01.712 --> 43:04.408
Where did this come from? You're
always defending the guy.

43:04.515 --> 43:07.075
- It's unnatural.
- I'd only do it if I knew that...

43:07.184 --> 43:08.913
No one would find
out or get hurt.

43:09.019 --> 43:12.386
Like, I wish that there was
a way that I could do it...

43:12.489 --> 43:14.320
And then I go back and
tell myself not to.

43:14.425 --> 43:17.519
Because I just want to know what
it feels like. That's all, really.

43:17.628 --> 43:18.822
I'm so proud.

43:19.196 --> 43:22.723
Finally, my husband, the hero.

43:28.973 --> 43:32.170
- We can't do that.
- I know.

43:32.543 --> 43:34.238
Did you call pest control?

43:35.045 --> 43:38.879
Babe, they're birds. You don't want a bunch
of dead baby birds up there, do you?

43:38.983 --> 43:43.010
- They don't sound like birds.
- She thinks there are rats in the attic.

43:44.021 --> 43:46.012
But the idea had been spoken...

43:46.123 --> 43:49.251
And the words wouldn't go back
after they had been uttered aloud.

43:49.360 --> 43:50.952
So you are understanding
this, right?

43:51.061 --> 43:53.586
You don't have to sell me
on not doing this, okay?

43:53.697 --> 43:56.723
- I don't think I told you...
- Even if you do stop yourself...

43:56.834 --> 44:00.395
Your double, from hitting platts, why
would he, your double, get in the box?

44:00.504 --> 44:03.962
And with no need for it, no
possible real-world application...

44:04.274 --> 44:07.732
No advantage at all to be gained
from it, the idea stayed.

44:08.379 --> 44:11.837
- How would you do it?
- I wouldn't.

44:12.282 --> 44:14.773
- Just for fun.
- I still wouldn't.

44:14.885 --> 44:17.718
- But what if there was a way to...
- Look, Abe, look.

44:18.188 --> 44:21.316
I'm not going to pretend like i
know anything about paradoxes...

44:21.425 --> 44:24.826
Or what follows them, and honestly, i
really don't believe in that crap.

44:24.928 --> 44:28.728
Kill your mom before you were born, whatever.
It has to work itself out somehow.

44:28.832 --> 44:30.959
- I don't know.
- This is what I know for sure.

44:31.068 --> 44:35.129
The worst thing in the world is to know
that the moment you are experiencing...

44:35.239 --> 44:38.037
Has already been defined,
that this is the second...

44:38.142 --> 44:42.044
Or third time through, or whatever.
And do you ever feel like...

44:43.113 --> 44:46.879
I don't know, maybe things aren't right,
like maybe your life is in disarray...

44:46.984 --> 44:51.148
Or just not what you would like and
you start to wonder what caused this.

44:52.356 --> 44:54.483
People are always blaming
their parents...

44:54.591 --> 44:57.890
As if, if their mom had breastfed
them, their lives would be different.

44:57.995 --> 44:59.155
Bunch of whiners.

44:59.263 --> 45:02.426
Yeah, they are. But what if it
wasn't something you wonder about?

45:02.533 --> 45:05.525
What if you knew this is not the
way things are supposed to be?

45:05.636 --> 45:09.766
I'm not like that. I'm not into the whole
"destiny, there's-only-one-right-way" thing.

45:09.873 --> 45:11.773
I'm not, either.
But what's worse?

45:11.875 --> 45:14.969
Thinking you're being paranoid
or knowing you should be?

45:20.884 --> 45:23.648
You don't have to look at
me like that. I'm okay.

45:29.827 --> 45:32.625
No, I just assumed that
you would. I trust her.

45:32.730 --> 45:36.530
- I know that when I decided to tell you...
- Decided to tell?

45:36.900 --> 45:41.735
I knew that you are married and that there's
no secrets. Anything I tell you, she'll know.

45:41.839 --> 45:43.363
- It's not a matter of trust.
- I know.

45:43.474 --> 45:46.102
It's just how much better will
it be if in a few days...

45:46.210 --> 45:49.668
I surprise her and we all just fly to
Costa Rica or somewhere for a month?

45:49.780 --> 45:53.307
We'll let her understand it gradually.
Maybe do some real estate shopping...

45:53.417 --> 45:56.318
For now, you can tell her you
had a good day in the market.

45:56.420 --> 45:57.540
- You don't understand.
- No.

45:57.588 --> 46:00.056
You don't understand the
questions that come with that.

46:00.157 --> 46:02.682
But we'll explain it to her,
and we'll take some time...

46:02.793 --> 46:03.987
To figure out what's next...

46:04.094 --> 46:07.655
Which, I think, should be building a
bigger box, like the size of a room...

46:07.765 --> 46:09.596
Where more than one
person could fit in.

46:09.700 --> 46:12.828
Safe or not, the thing feels
like a coffin the way it is.

46:13.570 --> 46:15.333
By the way, this is our guy.

46:16.440 --> 46:20.206
- What's the volume?
- Five-and-a-half.

46:20.811 --> 46:23.439
What's the return? Holy...

46:26.283 --> 46:30.549
No, I can't beat that. But mainly, I guess i
was just talking about Robert and Phillip.

46:30.654 --> 46:31.848
I don't want to tell them.

46:31.955 --> 46:34.219
I know they have a lot
invested in the group...

46:34.324 --> 46:35.689
I don't want to tell them.

46:36.260 --> 46:39.024
If you need me to take the
guilt on this one, fine, okay?

46:39.129 --> 46:40.892
I accept it gladly. It's mine.

46:40.998 --> 46:43.660
At the end of this week, they
can have whatever they want.

46:43.767 --> 46:47.032
I'll turn over patent rights on
everything from the last two years.

46:47.137 --> 46:49.503
They can have the equipment,
the garage, the house.

46:49.606 --> 46:52.473
They can have my truck if
that makes you feel better.

46:52.576 --> 46:55.670
But I am not telling them a
thing about this. We're not.

47:10.460 --> 47:12.690
God, everything is so
different in there.

47:12.796 --> 47:14.855
You can feel how
cut off you are.

47:15.199 --> 47:18.168
It's this entirely separate world
and you encompass most of it.

47:18.268 --> 47:21.726
And the sound. Isn't the sound
different on the inside?

47:21.905 --> 47:25.238
It's like it's singing. I guess you
can't hear it on the outside...

47:25.342 --> 47:28.869
- I had this dream in there.
- About what?

47:30.747 --> 47:35.411
I was on or near the ocean, and
i just kept hearing the surf.

47:35.919 --> 47:37.409
It was so uneventful.

47:38.222 --> 47:41.191
At night. And the tide
kept coming in and out.

47:53.971 --> 47:56.735
Come here for a second,
man. What's on your hand?

47:57.307 --> 47:59.104
- Are you bleeding?
- That is blood.

47:59.209 --> 48:00.767
- Turn around.
- You see it?

48:00.878 --> 48:03.278
Where is it coming from?
It's your notebook.

48:03.380 --> 48:06.474
- It's you. My gosh, it's on your ear.
- What is this?

48:06.817 --> 48:10.116
- Your ear's bleeding. Man.
- Give me that. I got it.

48:13.724 --> 48:16.659
- Is that normal? This isn't normal.
- For the machine?

48:17.494 --> 48:20.827
For people. You think it's
the machine? I got it.

48:38.882 --> 48:40.941
Great. I can actually get
some work done today.

48:41.051 --> 48:42.416
Hi, guys, what's going on?

48:42.519 --> 48:45.352
I always seem to get a lot more
done when I'm not locked out.

48:45.455 --> 48:46.888
He says they had to spray again.

48:46.990 --> 48:49.959
But he can't tell us about it
in advance. Is hero even here?

48:50.060 --> 48:52.392
You never see anything around
here but those geckos.

48:52.496 --> 48:54.123
- I know.
- I think it's for the geckos.

48:54.231 --> 48:55.596
- What?
- Why?

48:55.766 --> 48:58.997
- Hey, man, thanks for the present.
- How is that working out for you?

48:59.102 --> 49:02.833
You know what? You guys, both of you, you
make fun, but there is a difference.

49:02.940 --> 49:04.202
Wait. What did you call him?

49:04.308 --> 49:06.367
- What?
- When you walked in? What did you say?

49:06.476 --> 49:07.943
- He didn't tell you about it?
- No.

49:08.045 --> 49:12.175
All right. Rachel's ex-boyfriend walks
into my birthday party with a shotgun.

49:12.282 --> 49:13.715
- What?
- Swear to god.

49:13.817 --> 49:15.614
I've already gotten
that speech from Kara.

49:15.719 --> 49:18.085
- Filby!
- You'll get it. You have a wife and kid.

49:18.188 --> 49:21.487
It's funny how you two are the only
people that have a problem with it.

49:21.591 --> 49:24.059
- Everybody else thinks I did a good thing.
- You didn't.

49:24.161 --> 49:27.562
You can't risk your life and especially
the welfare of Kara and Lauren...

49:27.664 --> 49:28.688
For someone like Rachel.

49:28.799 --> 49:30.858
She practically begs for
this to happen to her.

49:30.968 --> 49:32.560
I figured at least
you'd understand.

49:32.669 --> 49:34.637
Understand what? You've
never been like this.

49:34.738 --> 49:38.435
That's what I mean. You see
how different things are now.

49:39.109 --> 49:41.270
Different? How are
things different?

49:42.012 --> 49:44.879
You see it, okay? I know you do.

49:47.517 --> 49:49.280
Look, that was the night...

49:49.987 --> 49:51.978
You had told me everything
about the machine.

49:52.089 --> 49:55.786
Everything you showed me was so fresh
in my head and when I saw this guy...

49:55.892 --> 49:58.452
I'm looking at him. I wasn't
going to let him do that.

49:58.562 --> 50:01.326
I wasn't going to let him
scare people like that.

50:01.765 --> 50:03.665
I know it was stupid, okay?

50:03.867 --> 50:07.303
But I mean, this whole idea, this
whole thing that we're doing.

50:07.871 --> 50:12.433
It just took some getting used to for me.
I wasn't completely acclimated to it.

50:12.576 --> 50:16.068
If it was just you, you had to worry
about, I'd still think you're stupid.

50:16.179 --> 50:19.046
But you have a family now,
and god, especially now...

50:19.149 --> 50:20.980
Anything like this
would be crazy.

50:21.084 --> 50:24.076
- I know, okay.
- I know you know that, but you've got to...

50:24.187 --> 50:27.213
- I know, okay?
- Filby!

50:29.893 --> 50:33.351
You little sack of... even if
you see him, don't tell me.

50:33.463 --> 50:37.092
It's not my fault if I don't know,
and I just hope the thing runs away.

50:37.200 --> 50:38.929
Then what are we doing out here?

50:39.036 --> 50:42.870
She worries about the cat. So you
look for the cat. It's what you do.

50:52.849 --> 50:54.783
- I don't know.
- What do you mean?

50:54.885 --> 50:58.184
It's embarrassing that the storage
room guy sees us come in together...

50:58.288 --> 50:59.482
But he never sees us leave.

50:59.589 --> 51:02.057
Yeah, but what do you think
the receptionist thinks...

51:02.159 --> 51:05.651
About two guys that come and get
a room for six hours every day?

51:09.099 --> 51:10.566
Did you unplug this?

51:14.438 --> 51:16.565
You brought your cell phone?

51:18.075 --> 51:20.066
Can I check the caller ID?

51:22.112 --> 51:23.875
Yeah, we're not back.

51:24.981 --> 51:27.882
Yeah, but you can't take
it back with you, okay?

51:32.489 --> 51:34.821
This is Aaron. Hey, babe.

51:35.692 --> 51:39.924
I'm not there. I had to come downtown
and hold some of these guys' hands.

51:40.030 --> 51:41.224
Tell me.

51:42.399 --> 51:45.664
That sounds good. No, I've got
to eat with these offsite fags.

51:45.769 --> 51:48.067
Save mine, though.
I'll have it later.

51:48.638 --> 51:53.098
Okay. Yeah, 6:00.

52:55.939 --> 52:57.873
- What?
- What?

52:58.108 --> 53:01.908
We're supposed to win this by two, they
just turned over with 12 on the clock.

53:02.012 --> 53:05.880
- We have to foul.
- No.

53:06.283 --> 53:09.946
What? No, we foul here, they
miss the first free throw...

53:10.053 --> 53:12.214
- And they come back with the three.
- Three points.

53:12.322 --> 53:13.516
That's right.

53:19.896 --> 53:23.127
Man, are you hungry? I haven't
eaten since later this afternoon.

53:26.736 --> 53:28.169
What's up, you guys?

53:35.745 --> 53:39.112
- You have got to be kidding.
- I'm sorry. I forgot it was in my pocket.

53:39.216 --> 53:40.877
- It's Kara?
- Yeah.

53:44.354 --> 53:45.912
How do cell phones work?

53:46.022 --> 53:48.889
If there's two duplicate phones
and I call the same number...

53:48.992 --> 53:51.256
Do they both ring at the
same time, or is there...

53:51.361 --> 53:53.522
- That's not how they work.
- It's a radio signal.

53:53.630 --> 53:54.892
No, it's a network.

53:54.998 --> 53:58.058
It checks each area and when it
finds the phone, it stops ringing.

53:58.168 --> 53:59.760
It rings the first one.

54:02.205 --> 54:04.969
- This one is ringing.
- Right.

54:05.075 --> 54:07.373
So the one your double has
in russellfield can't be.

54:07.477 --> 54:09.536
Right. I think we
broke symmetry.

54:10.847 --> 54:14.112
- Are you sure that's how cell phones work?
- No.

54:15.819 --> 54:17.514
You feel all right?

54:18.321 --> 54:20.482
- I feel fine. Do you?
- Yeah.

54:49.653 --> 54:51.814
Is Kara asleep? Did
i wake you up?

54:51.921 --> 54:55.857
Yeah. No, not me, it
felt more like a nap.

54:56.459 --> 54:59.792
I think my body's getting used to
these 36-hour days. What's going on?

54:59.896 --> 55:02.160
We can do this, but
we have to do it now.

55:02.265 --> 55:05.029
- Do you have his home address?
- Why now?

55:05.135 --> 55:08.332
We were planning on taking a trip
tomorrow, right? Just like today?

55:08.438 --> 55:09.666
Yeah, for stocks.

55:09.773 --> 55:14.210
Okay, well, half an hour ago I was
asleep. This car alarm woke me up.

55:14.311 --> 55:17.075
These kids were down skating
by, hitting cars on the block.

55:17.180 --> 55:21.139
So we go right now, do our business
at platts', get back in the box...

55:21.251 --> 55:23.776
And come back before those
kids set off those alarms.

55:23.887 --> 55:27.846
All we really have to do is stand there in
plain sight. That should scare them off.

55:27.957 --> 55:29.925
That way my double sleeps
through the night...

55:30.026 --> 55:34.486
They don't have this conversation, and
they get in the box tomorrow as usual.

55:36.099 --> 55:39.865
- They'll be changed. But...
- Yeah, but at least they'll get in the box.

55:42.172 --> 55:45.938
Wait, how do we go back that far if
the machines haven't been running?

55:48.311 --> 55:51.644
- Have they been running?
- Yeah.

55:51.781 --> 55:55.239
I started going by at 5:00, and
turning them on, 5:00 P.M.

55:55.985 --> 55:58.180
I got tired of the whole
unanswerable question...

55:58.288 --> 56:01.280
Are we doing this as an experiment
or are we doing this for me?

56:01.391 --> 56:04.053
- A little of both.
- 5:00.

56:04.160 --> 56:07.926
If we get this done by 3:00,
that's 10 hours in the box.

56:09.065 --> 56:11.124
I've got the O2
tanks in the car.

56:26.783 --> 56:29.445
- Is that...
- Is that Rachel's car?

56:30.920 --> 56:34.549
No, that's not Rachel's, that's her
dad's. They have the same kind.

56:34.791 --> 56:36.122
Did you see that?

56:36.960 --> 56:40.555
That's Mr. Granger. That's Thomas.
He's sitting in that car.

56:40.964 --> 56:41.988
What?

56:42.532 --> 56:44.796
I swear that was him. What
the hell is he doing...

56:44.901 --> 56:47.734
Sitting outside my house
at 2:00 in the morning?

56:49.839 --> 56:52.307
I don't believe this.
What, is he following us?

56:52.409 --> 56:55.071
- What are you doing?
- Let's just see what he wants.

56:55.178 --> 56:58.113
No, let's just get out of my
neighborhood first. Come on.

56:58.214 --> 57:00.648
- Did you see him today?
- No.

57:02.585 --> 57:04.985
I did. I saw him
this afternoon...

57:05.555 --> 57:06.783
Around 6:00.

57:06.890 --> 57:09.154
Are you sure you didn't see
him when we drove past?

57:09.259 --> 57:10.385
No, what?

57:10.960 --> 57:13.986
I'm positive this afternoon he
was clean-shaven. I know he was.

57:14.097 --> 57:16.497
He was ready to go to some
function with his wife.

57:16.599 --> 57:19.193
He looks like he's got a two
or three-day growth now.

57:19.302 --> 57:22.430
- Are you sure?
- No, I'm not sure, but I think so.

57:27.343 --> 57:29.834
Rachel. This is Abe.
Did I wake you up?

57:31.648 --> 57:34.708
Can I get your dad's number
from you real quick?

57:35.318 --> 57:37.411
Yeah. Okay, go ahead.

57:39.756 --> 57:42.020
- Yeah, thanks.
- What's he doing?

57:42.926 --> 57:44.723
He's just sitting there.

57:45.094 --> 57:48.894
He got out for a second and i
thought he was coming over...

57:49.399 --> 57:52.425
And then he got back in the
car. I think he's drunk.

57:52.535 --> 57:55.129
Hi, sorry to call so late.

57:55.505 --> 57:58.133
May I speak to Thomas
Granger, please?

57:59.576 --> 58:02.739
Yeah, this is James Miller
from putney and Myers.

58:04.347 --> 58:05.678
Hi, Mr. Granger?

58:07.050 --> 58:08.540
Thomas Granger?

58:12.722 --> 58:15.190
What are you doing
here? Come here!

58:30.406 --> 58:31.873
What happened?

58:33.076 --> 58:34.839
I'm okay. I slipped.

58:45.722 --> 58:49.214
I want to know what box he used. You
built one for you, right? Just one.

58:49.325 --> 58:51.452
Yeah. How many do
you think I made?

58:54.964 --> 58:57.831
These are set right. I
turned them on at 5:00.

58:58.434 --> 59:00.868
He could have used one
and gone back to 5:00.

59:00.970 --> 59:03.200
He could be in one
of them right now.

59:06.543 --> 59:09.239
I say we shut them off and
see if he's in there.

59:10.380 --> 59:12.109
Were you planning
on talking to him?

59:12.215 --> 59:14.410
Just tell me if you were.
I'm not going to be mad.

59:14.517 --> 59:16.348
No, I promise you.
You know I wouldn't.

59:16.452 --> 59:17.680
Are you sure you wouldn't?

59:17.787 --> 59:20.722
You're the one he can't get
near without passing out.

59:22.792 --> 59:25.556
There is no way I would tell
anyone about this. No way.

59:25.662 --> 59:27.789
- Can you think of any reason you might?
- No.

59:27.897 --> 59:30.730
Sometimes we do things but don't
know how we got to that point.

59:30.833 --> 59:32.300
- No, I can't.
- Can't what?

59:32.402 --> 59:35.235
I can't think of any
reason why I would.

59:36.439 --> 59:38.202
Well, I can't either.

59:38.908 --> 59:41.001
What if it was an emergency?

59:41.844 --> 59:46.440
- So you'd do it if it was an emergency?
- No, I don't know. What, so you might then?

59:47.116 --> 59:49.346
I don't know. What
kind of emergency?

59:50.787 --> 59:52.687
The permutations were endless.

59:55.191 --> 59:56.886
They tried again going
to the source...

59:56.993 --> 59:59.723
But even while keeping him
separated from Abe by two rooms...

59:59.829 --> 01:00:00.829
Ask him his name.

01:00:00.930 --> 01:00:03.660
Granger's condition could
only be described as vegetative.

01:00:03.766 --> 01:00:05.165
What did he say?

01:00:05.268 --> 01:00:07.828
From this they deduced that
the problem was recursive...

01:00:07.937 --> 01:00:11.566
But beyond that, found themselves
admitting, against their own nature...

01:00:11.674 --> 01:00:14.165
And once again, that the
answer was unknowable.

01:00:14.277 --> 01:00:15.972
- What do you think he changed?
- Not much.

01:00:16.079 --> 01:00:19.674
We didn't have any contact with him in
the 3 hours he could've done anything.

01:00:19.782 --> 01:00:23.775
I know he changed this. I know we weren't
having this conversation the first time...

01:00:23.886 --> 01:00:25.183
So you don't know what we lost.

01:00:25.288 --> 01:00:26.812
It really could not
have been much.

01:00:26.923 --> 01:00:29.721
It doesn't matter how much. It
just matters that it's changed.

01:00:29.826 --> 01:00:31.054
I know what you're saying.

01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:32.457
The question should have been...

01:00:32.562 --> 01:00:34.996
What to do with the comatose
man in the guest bedroom.

01:00:35.098 --> 01:00:38.795
But in Abe's mind he was
already compiling the list.

01:00:45.041 --> 01:00:46.736
Two mg of oral triazolam...

01:00:46.843 --> 01:00:51.644
Every seven hours induces a safe sleep
state and a minimal metabolic rate.

01:00:53.249 --> 01:00:54.876
At this continued
state of rest...

01:00:54.984 --> 01:00:57.919
The human body breathes 0.3
liters of oxygen a minute...

01:00:58.021 --> 01:01:00.546
Or roughly 2,000
liters in four days.

01:01:01.257 --> 01:01:04.590
A class e oxygen tank
holds 625 liters.

01:01:05.428 --> 01:01:06.793
To maintain hydration...

01:01:06.896 --> 01:01:11.026
The body cycles through a minimum of
two-and-a-half liters of water per day.

01:01:11.367 --> 01:01:13.528
Any food would be a luxury...

01:01:13.770 --> 01:01:16.398
But the small tank of medical
grade nitrous oxide...

01:01:16.506 --> 01:01:18.565
Would be needed on
the other side.

01:01:19.242 --> 01:01:22.473
Past the room that contained their
machines and up two levels...

01:01:22.578 --> 01:01:24.341
He made his way to
another room...

01:01:24.447 --> 01:01:29.146
Where he had stored what I will refer to
from here on as the failsafe machine.

01:03:10.253 --> 01:03:12.915
There he is. I've been
calling you all morning.

01:03:14.624 --> 01:03:15.682
Really?

01:03:16.659 --> 01:03:18.320
Your cell and work.

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:24.892
I'm not there.

01:03:25.001 --> 01:03:26.161
Really?

01:03:31.407 --> 01:03:32.999
I don't even know what.

01:03:35.812 --> 01:03:37.074
I'm just tired.

01:03:37.246 --> 01:03:41.478
I hope you're not implying that any
day is unimportant at cortex semi.

01:03:54.564 --> 01:03:57.727
I was going to come give you this
big speech about how we've been...

01:03:57.834 --> 01:04:00.701
Friends for a long time and built
up trust, that whole thing.

01:04:00.803 --> 01:04:02.270
But how about this instead?

01:04:02.371 --> 01:04:06.501
If you ditch work this afternoon and promise
to do the few small things I ask you...

01:04:06.609 --> 01:04:09.373
I will in return show you
the most important thing...

01:04:09.478 --> 01:04:12.072
That any living organism
has ever witnessed.

01:04:13.649 --> 01:04:17.745
At this point there would
have been some discussion.

01:04:20.289 --> 01:04:23.315
Abe would, of course,
want to know how.

01:04:25.428 --> 01:04:28.727
Aaron would have to explain all
about the storage manifest...

01:04:28.831 --> 01:04:32.289
And how it showed two rooms
under the name Abram terger.

01:04:32.668 --> 01:04:35.796
Then Abe would need to know how.

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:39.401
Aaron would explain that
when he went up there...

01:04:39.508 --> 01:04:41.373
And found the
failsafe running...

01:04:41.477 --> 01:04:43.570
He knew exactly what it was.

01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:47.044
But Abe would ask how.

01:04:47.850 --> 01:04:50.751
And then the bit about the
modular design of the coffins...

01:04:50.853 --> 01:04:54.619
And how it meant he could fold one
up and take it back inside another.

01:04:55.091 --> 01:04:57.252
They are not one-time use only.

01:04:57.360 --> 01:04:59.920
They are recyclable,
Aaron would say.

01:05:05.701 --> 01:05:07.430
How, Abe would ask.

01:05:10.706 --> 01:05:13.573
And Aaron would describe how
simple things become...

01:05:14.410 --> 01:05:17.971
When you know precisely what
someone will have for breakfast...

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:20.310
Even in a world of
tamper-proof lids.

01:05:42.905 --> 01:05:43.905
How?

01:05:45.374 --> 01:05:47.808
And that's where I would
have entered the story.

01:05:47.910 --> 01:05:50.378
Or exited, depending
on your reference.

01:05:52.648 --> 01:05:56.311
Because when Aaron came back the
second time, it wasn't so easy.

01:05:58.587 --> 01:06:01.112
He wasn't expecting
me to put up a fight.

01:06:01.223 --> 01:06:04.386
And by that time, he was
too exhausted to take me.

01:06:05.761 --> 01:06:08.594
But for reasons that are
only evident to me now...

01:06:08.831 --> 01:06:11.265
I understood that he
simply wanted it more.

01:06:11.367 --> 01:06:14.825
That he just had more
invested. So I left.

01:06:15.504 --> 01:06:18.735
He had already performed the
task, as I had intended to...

01:06:18.841 --> 01:06:22.277
Of recording the conversations
of the day just in case.

01:06:22.478 --> 01:06:25.470
Through that earpiece he had a
three-second lead on the world.

01:06:25.581 --> 01:06:28.448
Aaron, you need some
sleep. Some real sleep.

01:06:29.051 --> 01:06:31.747
I can't. I've got a schedule.

01:06:33.422 --> 01:06:36.949
He had but to speak aloud the
words that came into his head...

01:06:37.059 --> 01:06:39.425
And those around him
would fall in line.

01:07:00.049 --> 01:07:01.448
This is track 3.

01:07:01.550 --> 01:07:04.951
Abe is bringing my car around and
i am on my way to the court.

01:07:05.054 --> 01:07:06.214
I'll see will there.

01:07:06.322 --> 01:07:10.383
I'll invite him to the party and make
sure he's bringing Rachel's boyfriend.

01:07:11.093 --> 01:07:12.151
Will.

01:07:13.596 --> 01:07:15.427
You pretentious prick.

01:07:15.531 --> 01:07:17.795
What the hell is that?
Is that your cell phone?

01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:20.494
- No, it's a radio, man.
- You look like secret service.

01:07:20.603 --> 01:07:23.970
- You look like secret service.
- Ariel meeting is moved to Wednesday.

01:07:24.073 --> 01:07:26.473
What? What the hell am i
hanging around here for?

01:07:26.575 --> 01:07:28.008
Yeah, I know. Sorry.

01:07:28.110 --> 01:07:29.839
Nice shot, Aaron.

01:07:32.114 --> 01:07:34.139
Brick. That is ugly, Aaron.

01:07:34.250 --> 01:07:36.377
We could have used that
last week against ti.

01:07:36.485 --> 01:07:39.716
At least you've got your golf game.
I see you've been practicing.

01:07:39.822 --> 01:07:43.519
You come out here with your $3 tie
and think you can play whiteball.

01:07:43.626 --> 01:07:45.560
What are you doing tonight?

01:07:45.661 --> 01:07:48.789
I was supposed to be in Raleigh.
Thanks to you I missed my flight.

01:07:48.898 --> 01:07:50.160
- You know Robert?
- Yeah.

01:07:50.266 --> 01:07:52.757
He's got a birthday tonight.
Why don't you come out?

01:07:52.868 --> 01:07:56.827
- I'm just going to hang out with my cousin.
- Bring him. Rachel will be there.

01:07:56.939 --> 01:07:59.066
- Big reunion.
- Exactly.

01:08:15.257 --> 01:08:17.417
I don't think I'm doing this.

01:08:19.328 --> 01:08:20.420
Why not?

01:08:21.596 --> 01:08:24.930
Because I can think of a million
different ways that this can happen...

01:08:25.033 --> 01:08:26.934
And nobody comes anywhere
near getting hurt.

01:08:27.036 --> 01:08:29.937
I can call her and see if she
wants to do something else...

01:08:30.038 --> 01:08:32.303
Or better yet, not even talk
to her about the party.

01:08:32.408 --> 01:08:35.468
That's good for tonight. What about
tomorrow? And every other day?

01:08:35.578 --> 01:08:38.546
- I'll take care of tomorrow, tomorrow.
- You'll watch her always.

01:08:38.647 --> 01:08:42.207
This guy is crazy enough to walk into
a room of people waving a shotgun.

01:08:42.318 --> 01:08:44.786
What do you think he'll do
if he ever finds her alone?

01:08:44.886 --> 01:08:48.323
This way, we know exactly what happens.
We have complete control over it.

01:08:48.424 --> 01:08:51.621
At the end of the night, this guy
is arrested and goes to jail.

01:08:51.727 --> 01:08:54.457
That's the way it goes.
Your words, not mine.

01:08:55.096 --> 01:08:56.462
Now come on, it has to be you.

01:08:56.564 --> 01:09:00.001
She said she was there because
you told her you would be there.

01:09:05.573 --> 01:09:08.407
Don't tell me I came back
and did this for nothing.

01:09:12.781 --> 01:09:14.112
He doesn't fire?

01:09:15.584 --> 01:09:17.279
- No. He didn't fire.
- He never fires?

01:09:17.386 --> 01:09:19.718
- Not even when you rushed him?
- No. He didn't.

01:09:19.822 --> 01:09:22.586
He didn't the time i
was, when I rushed him.

01:09:22.691 --> 01:09:25.285
And from what Robert tells
you, he didn't do it tonight.

01:09:25.394 --> 01:09:27.794
He doesn't have the nerve.
We know everything.

01:09:27.897 --> 01:09:29.455
Okay? We're prescient.

01:09:36.404 --> 01:09:37.895
We can still be careful.

01:09:38.006 --> 01:09:40.703
Maybe we can get to the
gun without him knowing.

01:09:41.076 --> 01:09:42.407
We definitely can.

01:09:42.511 --> 01:09:46.037
He leaves it in the truck before he
goes in. We don't even need to...

01:09:46.148 --> 01:09:49.709
- But if it makes you feel better...
- What's wrong with our hands?

01:09:51.953 --> 01:09:53.353
What do you mean?

01:09:53.455 --> 01:09:55.719
Why can't we write
like normal people?

01:09:58.127 --> 01:10:00.721
I don't know. I can
see the letters.

01:10:02.831 --> 01:10:07.632
I know what they should look like. I just
can't get my hand to make them easily.

01:10:08.470 --> 01:10:11.564
Try comparing it to your left
hand. Mine looks the same.

01:10:31.327 --> 01:10:33.591
Guess what today is.

01:10:36.065 --> 01:10:38.556
No, no. It's your friend
Robert's birthday.

01:10:40.002 --> 01:10:42.800
He says he likes records, so
i got him the best of bread.

01:10:42.905 --> 01:10:44.668
No, real records, like vinyl.

01:10:45.007 --> 01:10:49.273
I can tell you with certainty what i
did that night when it was my turn.

01:10:50.079 --> 01:10:54.243
But I think it would do little good,
because what the world remembers...

01:10:54.350 --> 01:10:58.047
The actuality, the last revision
is what counts, apparently.

01:10:59.255 --> 01:11:01.587
So how many times did
it take Aaron...

01:11:01.690 --> 01:11:04.284
As he cycled through the
same conversations...

01:11:04.393 --> 01:11:06.827
Lip-synching trivia
over and over?

01:11:07.296 --> 01:11:10.561
How many times would it take
before he got it right?

01:11:10.699 --> 01:11:12.530
Three? Four?

01:11:13.702 --> 01:11:14.862
Twenty?

01:11:16.071 --> 01:11:19.336
I've decided to believe that only
one more would have done it.

01:11:19.441 --> 01:11:22.433
I can almost sleep at night
if there is only one more.

01:11:23.312 --> 01:11:27.476
Slowly and methodically, he
reverse-engineered a perfect moment.

01:11:29.785 --> 01:11:32.276
He took from his surroundings
what was needed...

01:11:32.388 --> 01:11:34.583
And made of it something more.

01:11:47.136 --> 01:11:50.367
And once the details had been
successfully navigated...

01:11:50.472 --> 01:11:53.737
There would be nothing left to
do but wait for the conflict.

01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:01.278
Maybe the obligatory
last-minute moral debate...

01:12:01.383 --> 01:12:04.147
Until the noise of the room
escalates into panic...

01:12:04.253 --> 01:12:07.450
And background screams
as the gunman walks in.

01:12:08.857 --> 01:12:12.725
And eventually he must have got it perfect
and it must have been beautiful...

01:12:12.828 --> 01:12:15.524
With all the praise and
adoration he had coming.

01:12:15.631 --> 01:12:18.156
He had probably saved
lives, after all.

01:12:20.002 --> 01:12:23.233
Who knows what would have
happened if he hadn't been there?

01:12:38.220 --> 01:12:40.620
I know that things
are bad, okay?

01:12:42.424 --> 01:12:45.291
I know that you don't agree
with what I've done.

01:12:45.961 --> 01:12:47.053
I know that you're upset.

01:12:47.162 --> 01:12:50.791
And to be honest, I'm not too happy
with you, either, right now.

01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:54.233
But you know that this is
going to pass. Let's just go.

01:12:54.336 --> 01:12:57.271
Let's go somewhere where we
don't speak the language.

01:12:57.373 --> 01:12:59.398
Aaron, we don't have
the money back here...

01:12:59.508 --> 01:13:01.339
And we'd have to steal
our own passports.

01:13:01.443 --> 01:13:03.343
Money? We'll make money.

01:13:03.612 --> 01:13:05.773
They have sports betting
in Vegas. March madness.

01:13:05.881 --> 01:13:08.816
We'll make enough in one night
to finance a thousand vacations.

01:13:08.917 --> 01:13:11.977
Passports. You know they're
not using theirs, anyways.

01:13:12.788 --> 01:13:14.881
Now, come on. I'm
thinking star city.

01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:17.424
Check out the cosmonaut
training grounds.

01:13:17.659 --> 01:13:19.183
I'm staying here.

01:13:20.129 --> 01:13:21.187
Why?

01:13:31.473 --> 01:13:33.907
They'll be building their
own boxes in another day.

01:13:34.009 --> 01:13:36.239
And yours already knows
what they've built.

01:13:36.345 --> 01:13:39.508
You're not going to be able
to watch them forever.

01:13:40.616 --> 01:13:42.743
The box Abe is
building won't work.

01:13:43.285 --> 01:13:45.014
He's got it wired wrong.

01:13:45.721 --> 01:13:47.245
And if they fix that...

01:13:47.356 --> 01:13:50.325
I'll start actually taking pieces
out of it. It's just a gimmick.

01:13:50.426 --> 01:13:51.586
It doesn't work anymore.

01:13:51.693 --> 01:13:54.491
Your double will say they have
to move on to something else.

01:13:54.663 --> 01:13:56.528
And mine will agree.
They're friends.

01:13:56.632 --> 01:13:58.429
You're staying? Why?

01:13:58.634 --> 01:14:00.625
Why? Let's see, why
would Abe stay?

01:14:00.736 --> 01:14:03.728
What possible reason could
there be to be here?

01:14:06.241 --> 01:14:09.677
I guess that it just won't
go back far enough, will it?

01:14:11.113 --> 01:14:14.742
Tell you what, why don't you take Kara
and Lauren and put them in the box...

01:14:14.850 --> 01:14:19.014
And then you and Aaron can each keep a
set and you can stop feeding off it.

01:14:19.121 --> 01:14:21.954
- Don't come back.
- You can each keep a set and a hemisphere.

01:14:22.057 --> 01:14:24.992
There hasn't been a reason to
show you what I'm capable of...

01:14:25.093 --> 01:14:27.425
But I'm telling this
you now. Go out there.

01:14:27.529 --> 01:14:31.021
Do whatever the hell you want. There's
no way in the world I can stop you.

01:14:31.133 --> 01:14:32.828
But don't come back here...

01:14:32.935 --> 01:14:34.903
And don't come near them.

01:14:36.038 --> 01:14:37.164
Any of them.

01:14:52.855 --> 01:14:55.585
Now I have repaid any
debt I may have owed you.

01:14:56.225 --> 01:14:57.920
You know all that I know.

01:14:58.293 --> 01:15:01.820
My voice is the only proof that you
will have of the truth of any of this.

01:15:01.930 --> 01:15:04.626
I might have written a
letter with my signature...

01:15:04.733 --> 01:15:07.258
But my handwriting is
not what it used to be.

01:15:09.771 --> 01:15:12.501
Maybe you've had the presence
of mind to record this.

01:15:12.608 --> 01:15:14.132
That's your prerogative.

01:15:14.243 --> 01:15:16.234
You will not be
contacted by me again.

01:15:16.345 --> 01:15:17.539
Good morning.

01:15:20.115 --> 01:15:21.412
Every half-meter.

01:15:23.318 --> 01:15:24.615
Everywhere.

01:15:26.522 --> 01:15:29.116
And if you look, you
will not find me.

01:15:30.305 --> 01:15:36.927
