- He so in love with you.

even really think

04:48.792 --> 04:50.667

like that.

04:50.667 --> 04:53.667
Seriously, he's always
like, "Shoshanna,

04:53.667 --> 04:56.875
you're a really shiny star
at this company."

04:56.875 --> 04:58.125
He wants you.

04:58.125 --> 05:00.542
He wants to take you
to a love hotel

05:00.542 --> 05:03.041
- and check in for a year.
- ( laughs )

05:03.041 --> 05:05.542
First of all,
maybe I am a shiny star
at the company,

05:05.542 --> 05:07.792
because even though
I've only been here
for a very short while,

05:07.792 --> 05:10.834
I truly feel like
this is my home and
you people are my family.

05:10.834 --> 05:13.542
And I don't even
really care about people
in America anymore.

05:13.542 --> 05:15.542
But second of all,
I also kind of have
a boyfriend.

05:15.542 --> 05:19.041
And third of all,
he's my boss and Cheryl Semper
would fucking kill me.

you're overreacting.

- Hannah: No, you don't.
- I really do.

06:50.875 --> 06:52.834
Who cares what he looks at
when he's masturbating?

06:52.834 --> 06:55.458
Okay, is this some weird
new honeymoon Marnie?

06:55.458 --> 06:58.125
Next thing you're gonna
tell me that, like, monogamy
is a construct.

06:58.125 --> 06:59.959
I mean,
in a sense it is.

06:59.959 --> 07:02.000
Who stole your soul?

07:02.000 --> 07:03.875
Look, I'm not gonna
lie to you and pretend

07:03.875 --> 07:07.500
that Ecuador hasn't
been, like, a really
life-changing experience,

07:07.500 --> 07:10.083
but, I don't know,
this might be a little
bit enlightened of him.

07:10.083 --> 07:13.166
Enlightened?
Marnie, he keeps
a whole folder

07:13.166 --> 07:15.542
of ex-girlfriend pinups
to jerk it to, okay?

07:15.542 --> 07:17.750
And these aren't, like,
porn stars or strippers.

07:17.750 --> 07:20.333
They're, like, regular girls--
nurses and legal aides

07:20.333 --> 07:23.500
just, like, smiling
with their tits and
pussy flaps hanging out.

07:23.500 --> 07:25.583
- Ew.
- How is this different
than killing someone

07:25.583 --> 07:27.500
and keeping
their shrunken head
as a trophy?

07:27.500 --> 07:30.458
Oh, my God, you need
to take, like, a serious
step back here.

07:30.458 --> 07:33.000
He is not cheating on you.
He's not doing anything mean.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.750
In fact,
he's the nicest guy
you've ever dated

07:34.750 --> 07:36.250
by, like,
a planet distance.

07:36.250 --> 07:39.041
Well, I really thought
you would be on my side.

07:39.041 --> 07:41.667
Hannah, I am on your side.
I'm always on your side.

07:41.667 --> 07:44.792
Okay, I just fully saw
your husband's dick.

07:44.792 --> 07:48.000
Oh, my God, I love
hearing the word husband.

08:00.375 --> 08:02.208
Oh, my God, that is
so nice to hear.

08:02.208 --> 08:03.625
Seriously,
I'm loving it here.

08:03.625 --> 08:05.834
Like, this corporate
environment is the dream

08:05.834 --> 08:08.166
I'm living for every day
of my young life.

08:08.166 --> 08:10.000
I love it so much.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.583
You know how people say
that you can't run away
from your problems?

08:12.583 --> 08:14.333
Well, I moved away
from mine and it worked,

08:14.333 --> 08:17.375
so people are so wrong
so much of the time.

08:17.375 --> 08:20.417
Which is honestly why,
Shoshanna,

08:20.417 --> 08:23.834
like, this is so hard
for me to say.

08:23.834 --> 08:25.750
What-- what's so hard
for you to say?

08:25.750 --> 08:28.250
Let me start
at the beginning.

08:30.041 --> 08:32.082
As you know,
corporate Japan

08:32.082 --> 08:33.958
is in a little bit
of trouble.

08:33.958 --> 08:35.166
Okay.

08:35.166 --> 08:37.041
And so there's fewer jobs.

08:37.041 --> 08:42.417
And now it means
fewer of you and your job.

08:43.417 --> 08:45.250
Abigail, are you--

08:45.250 --> 08:46.708
are you firing me?

08:46.708 --> 08:48.583
No!
No, no, no, no, no.

08:48.583 --> 08:51.750
- No.
- Oh, my God, that just
scared the shit out of me.

08:51.750 --> 08:53.792
That literally
would have been,
like, the worst thing

08:53.792 --> 08:55.792
to ever happen to me
in my life.

08:55.792 --> 08:58.083
Um, it's act--

08:58.083 --> 08:59.792
it's called--

08:59.792 --> 09:01.708
we're managing you out.

09:01.708 --> 09:05.792
So I still have
my job, though, right?

09:05.792 --> 09:09.208
It's like
a very light ending
of a relationship

09:09.208 --> 09:12.625
and a business partnership
and, like, a salary.

09:12.625 --> 09:16.500
Wait, I'm sorry.
How is this different
from firing?

09:17.583 --> 09:20.333
I guess because it has
a different name.

09:21.458 --> 09:23.291
I moved to Japan.

09:23.291 --> 09:26.125
We are gonna pay
for your ticket back.

09:26.125 --> 09:30.417
And it's gonna be
in fucking business class.

09:30.417 --> 09:34.000
No, I don't want to go back
even in business class.

09:35.125 --> 09:38.417
Abigail, you cannot
make me go back.

09:40.458 --> 09:42.959
Why are you upset?
Because they're exes
or because they're not you?

09:42.959 --> 09:45.750
All of it, Ray.
I don't like any
of it, okay?

09:45.750 --> 09:48.458
And then he's taken
this radical anti-porn stance

09:48.458 --> 09:50.500
like he's Andrea
fucking Dworkin.

09:50.500 --> 09:53.583
So he's opposed to
the enslavement and
trafficking of young women.

09:53.583 --> 09:55.917
What a monster.
How outrageous!

09:55.917 --> 09:58.500
Listen, Ray,
I just need to know if you
think it's weird, okay?

09:58.500 --> 10:00.375
'Cause I talked to Marnie
and she doesn't.

10:00.375 --> 10:02.000
When did you talk
to Marnie?

10:02.000 --> 10:03.333
Don't be thirsty, Ray.

10:03.333 --> 10:06.583
Look, Hannah, I want
to take your side on this.

10:06.583 --> 10:08.208
Okay? I really do.

10:08.208 --> 10:10.875
But the moral
underpinnings of your
argument are at best,

10:10.875 --> 10:12.708
at very best,
extremely unclear.

10:12.708 --> 10:15.667
For the record,
I think it's very gross.

10:15.667 --> 10:18.000
Thank you, okay?
'Cause I was worried
I was getting, like, old

10:18.000 --> 10:21.834
and pedestrian about sex
and you know I pride myself
on my sexual openness.

10:21.834 --> 10:25.166
What I lack in skill,
I make up for in
extreme curiosity.

10:25.166 --> 10:27.458
So why are you getting
your panties in
a bunch, then?

10:27.458 --> 10:30.000
'Cause, Ray, I worked
very, very hard

10:30.000 --> 10:32.041
to overcome
the challenges

10:32.041 --> 10:33.708
of my nontraditional
body type

10:33.708 --> 10:35.208
and accept myself
for who I am.

10:35.208 --> 10:37.708
I'm not gonna be
edged out of my own life

10:37.708 --> 10:41.208
by girls who don't
even have any interesting
fat deposits on them.

10:41.208 --> 10:44.834
Until this happened,
I was basically Kate Upton
to myself.

10:44.834 --> 10:48.500
Hannah, you're still
hot... to Fran.

10:48.500 --> 10:50.625
You're gonna thank me later
for using the special lens.

10:50.625 --> 10:52.708
It's gonna really
distinguish these photos

10:52.708 --> 10:54.583
from all the other ones
he's jerking it to.

10:54.583 --> 10:57.083
Paint me like one
of your French girls, Ray.

10:57.083 --> 11:01.125
Okay, what I need from you,
Hannah, is less talking
and more animus.

11:01.125 --> 11:02.375
Okay.

11:02.375 --> 11:04.208
You look like you have
a spinal cord injury.

11:04.208 --> 11:06.708
- Put some life in those limbs.
- Like a kind of like a...

11:06.708 --> 11:09.959
Yeah, create
some lean lines.

11:09.959 --> 11:11.000
Nice.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.750
Try once with, like,
a coy smile.

11:12.750 --> 11:14.875
Like you know
a juicy secret.

11:16.375 --> 11:18.208
Not the Katie Holmes.

11:18.208 --> 11:19.875
Let me put this in terms
you'll understand.

11:19.875 --> 11:21.750
Like you know a cake
is coming later.

11:21.750 --> 11:24.750
- ( gasps )
There she is.
- ( camera clicking )

11:27.792 --> 11:31.917
I just don't
understand.

11:31.917 --> 11:34.083
It makes no sense.

11:34.083 --> 11:37.000
It's total
fucking bullshit.

11:37.000 --> 11:41.208
I know for a fact
we are keeping even
that hooker Erica.

11:41.208 --> 11:45.125
But now you go home
to your future husband, yes?

11:45.125 --> 11:47.417
And go out with
Ashley Tisdale.

11:47.417 --> 11:51.792
No, you guys,
I don't want to go
back to America.

11:51.792 --> 11:53.625
And I don't know
Ashley Tisdale.

11:53.625 --> 11:56.458
I saw her once
at a gynecologist
appointment

11:56.458 --> 11:58.208
and I tried to explain
that to you guys,

11:58.208 --> 12:00.959
but you misunderstood
and so I just let it go.

12:00.959 --> 12:02.834
Then why don't you stay?

12:02.834 --> 12:04.834
Because I can't
afford to, okay?

12:04.834 --> 12:07.417
My parents aren't rich.
They didn't invent Chuhai.

12:07.417 --> 12:10.417
Oh, really?

12:10.417 --> 12:11.959
You seem very wealthy

12:11.959 --> 12:14.458
because of your
spoiled attitude.

12:14.458 --> 12:15.959
Yeah.

12:15.959 --> 12:18.708
That's just how
Americans act.

12:18.708 --> 12:20.959
We're kind of assholes.

12:20.959 --> 12:23.166
You know, I really don't
want to talk about what
happened last night.

12:23.166 --> 12:24.708
I mean, you're kind
of a jerk-off.

12:24.708 --> 12:26.792
- So this woman's
the lead?
- Yeah.

12:26.792 --> 12:28.291
That's Detective Mosedale.

12:28.291 --> 12:29.583
She's been on the show
for 12 years.

12:29.583 --> 12:31.500
She's richer
than the president.

12:33.333 --> 12:36.291
- Okay, oh, it's back on.
- Oh, my God!

12:36.291 --> 12:37.792
Hey, that's him.

12:37.792 --> 12:39.500
Hey, you.

12:39.500 --> 12:41.667
Hey!

12:41.667 --> 12:43.708
Hey, slow it down!

12:43.708 --> 12:45.375
We're not
gonna hurt you.

12:46.375 --> 12:48.834
We got a car,
genius.

12:50.667 --> 12:52.708
Mosedale:
We're not gonna
hurt you, okay?

12:52.708 --> 12:54.500
Just want to ask you
some questions.

12:54.500 --> 12:56.500
All right.
All right.

12:56.500 --> 12:58.125
All right,
what's it worth to you?

12:58.125 --> 13:01.333
- ( laughs )
- They really messed up
your teeth, huh?

13:01.333 --> 13:02.834
It's just makeup.

13:02.834 --> 13:04.792
How long you been
living on the streets?

13:04.792 --> 13:07.583
Oh, what do you care?

13:07.583 --> 13:09.750
Want to hold on
to that 20 or not?

13:09.750 --> 13:11.291
I don't know.
I don't know.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.875
Maybe a year,
maybe five years.
Who knows?

13:13.875 --> 13:17.250
Time passes in strange
ways on the outside.
You can write that down.

13:17.250 --> 13:20.000
All I know is
I've been on my own
since I was 11 years old.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.208
( scoffs )
Cry me a river.

13:22.208 --> 13:24.750
I was born
in an orphanage,
all right?

13:24.750 --> 13:26.375
I've always
been on my own.

13:26.375 --> 13:28.458
Her character
had a fucked-up
childhood.

13:28.458 --> 13:30.708
There was a flashback
in season four.

13:30.708 --> 13:33.000
- That's why she's so...
- Right.

13:33.000 --> 13:37.166
Listen, brother,
we're both from
the streets.

13:37.166 --> 13:42.375
So let's help Trippi out
before it's too late, okay?

13:44.250 --> 13:45.875
What do you say?

13:51.542 --> 13:53.959
( groans )

13:53.959 --> 13:56.875
You were amazing.

13:56.875 --> 13:58.750
- No, I wasn't.
- Yeah.

13:58.750 --> 14:01.125
No, no, no.
I'm 100% serious.

14:01.125 --> 14:04.333
You-- I'm so impressed
right now.

14:04.333 --> 14:07.834
You were-- you were
tough and grimy

14:07.834 --> 14:09.375
and, like, streety,

14:09.375 --> 14:11.083
but you were
totally vulnerable.

14:11.083 --> 14:14.750
Like, you played
into that pain so well.

14:14.750 --> 14:16.041
I'm so impressed.

14:16.041 --> 14:17.583
You were amazing.
You really were.

14:17.583 --> 14:20.000
Subtle but forceful.
It was very strong.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.708
Thank you.

14:25.208 --> 14:27.417
All right, let's just
sit in silence now.

14:27.417 --> 14:30.834
Adam's gonna be famous.
Adam's gonna be famous!

14:30.834 --> 14:32.667
- Yes!
- ( laughing )

14:32.667 --> 14:35.417
( phone chimes )
Konnichi wa!

14:36.458 --> 14:38.625
Scott:
Well, hello, kitty.

14:39.542 --> 14:41.792
( sighs )
Hey.

14:41.792 --> 14:44.083
You don't sound great.

14:44.083 --> 14:46.625
I'm coming home.

14:46.625 --> 14:49.750
What?
That's great.

14:49.750 --> 14:51.917
Yeah.

14:51.917 --> 14:54.000
Unless it's not.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.458
Um...

14:56.458 --> 14:59.959
I lost my job
and I don't know why.

14:59.959 --> 15:02.542
Oh, man.

15:02.542 --> 15:05.291
Oh, man,
that sucks dicks.

15:05.291 --> 15:09.250
You know what?
Corporations don't
like visionaries.

15:09.250 --> 15:13.125
But I can't help but feel
a little bit excited

15:13.125 --> 15:15.583
on a very selfish level.

15:15.583 --> 15:17.458
That's, um,
really sweet,

15:17.458 --> 15:21.208
except I don't have
a job still, so...

15:21.208 --> 15:23.000
Okay, all right,
listen to me.

15:23.000 --> 15:26.208
Just get on a plane.
Like, right away.

15:26.208 --> 15:27.458
Just rip off the Band-Aid.

15:27.458 --> 15:29.750
Mm, I don't know.

15:29.750 --> 15:31.959
Trust me,
good-byes suck.

15:31.959 --> 15:33.875
You don't want
to drag it out.
Just come back.

15:33.875 --> 15:36.667
Come back to me
and I will take such
good care of you.

15:36.667 --> 15:39.291
And we'll just
move forward.

15:40.333 --> 15:43.458
I mean, yeah,
maybe you're right.

15:43.458 --> 15:46.625
I am. I am right.
Just get on a plane.

15:46.625 --> 15:48.542
I'll even pick you up
at the airport.

15:49.917 --> 15:52.250
Um, yeah.

15:52.250 --> 15:54.000
Yeah, you know what?

15:54.000 --> 15:55.583
I'm gonna do it.

15:55.583 --> 15:58.834
I'll just--
I'll just book
the first flight

15:58.834 --> 16:01.542
and I'll text you
the info.

16:01.542 --> 16:05.417
Shoshanna,
I'm really, really sorry
about your job.

16:05.417 --> 16:08.500
But now we get
to have you back.

16:08.500 --> 16:10.417
Yeah, okay.
I'll see you soon, okay?

16:10.417 --> 16:12.750
- Okay. Bye.
- Okay, bye.

16:21.667 --> 16:23.375
( sniffles )

16:45.083 --> 16:46.792
( sniffles )

16:46.792 --> 16:49.250
( moaning softly )

16:54.750 --> 16:59.500
It's like you're not
really here right now.

16:59.500 --> 17:03.000
- Is that--
- Oh, I'm fully here.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.083
It just seems like you're
kind of disassociated.

17:06.083 --> 17:07.834
Like you're someplace
else or something.

17:07.834 --> 17:09.208
I'm not.

17:09.208 --> 17:11.791
Look at me.
Look at me.

17:12.916 --> 17:15.416
I love you.

17:15.416 --> 17:17.708
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

17:17.708 --> 17:19.750
Are you all right?
Is this okay?

17:19.750 --> 17:21.834
Yeah, you shouldn't need me
to tell you I love you.

17:21.834 --> 17:24.791
All those pictures
of your ex-girlfriends can
tell you that they love you.

17:26.165 --> 17:29.125
Really?

17:29.125 --> 17:32.375
I can't get over
that it was the mother's
boyfriend the whole time.

17:32.375 --> 17:35.458
It's always
the mother's boyfriend.

17:35.458 --> 17:38.458
Do you think your character
is gonna stay off the streets
from now on?

17:38.458 --> 17:41.792
No, only way
of life he knows.

17:41.792 --> 17:43.792
( both laugh )

17:43.792 --> 17:46.333
All right, I'm trying
to get exactly 13 hours
of sleep a night,

17:46.333 --> 17:48.500
so Grandpa's got to
shut it down.

17:48.500 --> 17:50.250
- Good night.
- Good night.

17:50.250 --> 17:53.375
Let's try
to keep the volume
at a courteous level.

17:53.375 --> 17:55.375
Okay?
Thank you.

17:55.375 --> 17:57.000
( door closes )

17:57.000 --> 17:58.583
( laughs )

17:58.583 --> 18:01.125
( silent )

18:01.125 --> 18:03.750
I don't know
how you do it.

18:05.125 --> 18:06.959
( clear throat )

18:08.458 --> 18:09.667
What?

18:09.667 --> 18:11.500
Nothing.

18:15.834 --> 18:20.792
I wrote a haiku
up here

18:20.792 --> 18:25.125
like a--
like a month ago.

18:25.125 --> 18:27.458
- That's weird.
- It's like from your...

18:27.458 --> 18:29.583
- Why would you--
- ...perspective.

18:29.583 --> 18:31.125
Why would you do that?

18:31.125 --> 18:33.250
It was--
I forgot how
I got up there.

18:33.250 --> 18:35.166
How did--

18:36.875 --> 18:38.834
What are you doing?

18:40.000 --> 18:42.500
We're just friends.

18:44.041 --> 18:46.000
Are we?

18:47.875 --> 18:51.250
I'm not doing
this "will they,
won't they" shit.

18:52.208 --> 18:54.000
No fucking way.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.166
I'm sorry.

18:56.166 --> 18:58.208
Thank you.

18:58.208 --> 19:00.083
Bye.

19:00.083 --> 19:02.208
( door closes )

19:09.291 --> 19:10.875
( imitating gunshots )

19:10.875 --> 19:13.417
( groans,
imitating impact )

19:15.041 --> 19:17.917
- ( music playing )
- ( crowd cheering )

19:19.375 --> 19:21.208
( singing in Japanese )

19:21.208 --> 19:24.166
( crowd cheering )

20:08.834 --> 20:11.000
( music playing )

20:44.291 --> 20:46.458
( man speaks Japanese )

20:53.166 --> 20:56.000
( speaks Japanese )

21:00.333 --> 21:01.333
Shoshanna.

21:01.333 --> 21:02.708
- Hi.
- Hi.

21:02.708 --> 21:05.291
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

21:05.291 --> 21:08.625
( wincing, laughing )

21:08.625 --> 21:12.625
( speaking Japanese )

21:12.625 --> 21:13.500
( groaning )

21:13.500 --> 21:15.166
Shoshanna.
Shoshanna.

21:15.166 --> 21:16.625
You like it, yeah?

21:16.625 --> 21:18.500
Holy shit.

21:19.959 --> 21:22.208
- ( groaning )
- ( speaks Japanese )

21:22.208 --> 21:23.500
( speaks Japanese,
laughing )

21:23.500 --> 21:25.959
Shoshanna.
Shoshanna.

21:25.959 --> 21:28.250
- Your turn.
- What? No.

21:28.250 --> 21:30.166
You dress like nurse.

21:30.166 --> 21:31.875
- Please?
- No.

21:31.875 --> 21:33.708
- No.
- Come on.

21:33.708 --> 21:35.291
Shoshanna!

21:35.291 --> 21:37.875
- Shoshanna.
- ( men chanting )
Nurse, nurse, nurse,

21:37.875 --> 21:39.166
nurse, nurse...

21:39.166 --> 21:41.834
( speaks Japanese )

21:41.834 --> 21:44.417
Masa:
Shoshanna, look
what I'm doing.

21:44.417 --> 21:46.417
Wax dripped
into my asshole.

21:46.417 --> 21:47.959
Put the fucking
nurse costume.

21:47.959 --> 21:50.125
- Okay, okay.
Fuck it, okay.
- Yeah?

21:50.125 --> 21:53.917
- I'll do it.
- Oh, yeah!

22:02.667 --> 22:04.500
( speaking Japanese )

22:05.375 --> 22:07.875
Ah!

22:07.875 --> 22:09.959
Oh, Shoshanna.

22:09.959 --> 22:13.834
- Men: Oh! Kawaii!
- Shoshanna!

22:13.834 --> 22:16.291
- Come, come.
- Man: Sexy girl.

22:16.291 --> 22:17.375
Man #2:
Cutie.

22:17.375 --> 22:19.041
- Hey, Shoshanna.
- You try.

22:19.041 --> 22:21.250
- What? No.
- Yeah, yeah.

22:21.250 --> 22:24.208
- I don't want to--
- Yes.

22:24.208 --> 22:26.750
No.

22:26.750 --> 22:27.792
Shh.

22:27.792 --> 22:30.125
- Shoshanna, hard, hard.
- Okay, okay.

22:30.125 --> 22:32.250
Okay.

22:32.250 --> 22:33.583
Okay, just one.
Just one time.

22:33.583 --> 22:35.417
- Just one time.
- Yay!

22:35.417 --> 22:37.750
( clapping, chattering )

22:39.417 --> 22:41.542
- Shoshanna: Okay, okay, okay.
- Man: Yes, yes, yes.

22:41.542 --> 22:43.250
Shoshanna.

22:43.250 --> 22:45.417
- What?
- Is that all you got?

22:45.417 --> 22:47.417
( speaks Japanese )
Harder.

22:47.417 --> 22:50.750
- Oh.
- Men: Ooh!

22:52.291 --> 22:54.750
- Ryota: Big one.
Big one.
- Okay.

22:54.750 --> 22:57.667
- Okay.
- Ah!

22:58.667 --> 23:00.417
Bom! Bom! Bom!

23:00.417 --> 23:02.875
Okay, one more.
One more. One more.

23:02.875 --> 23:05.000
Ah!

23:05.000 --> 23:07.250
- Oh, shit.
- ( laughing )

23:07.250 --> 23:08.792
Oh, shit.

23:08.792 --> 23:12.458
- Oh, that fucking hurt.
- Shit. Shit.

23:12.458 --> 23:14.750
Are you okay?

23:14.750 --> 23:16.208
I'm sorry.

23:16.208 --> 23:18.667
Does that make
your pussy wet,
you sick fuck?

23:18.667 --> 23:20.959
- You love it, don't you?
- I'm sorry.

23:20.959 --> 23:23.125
- I'm--
- ( laughing )

23:23.125 --> 23:25.041
Yoshi.
Yoshi.

23:25.041 --> 23:28.291
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

23:28.291 --> 23:30.291
( laughing )

23:37.625 --> 23:40.291
I am so sorry,
Shoshanna.

23:40.291 --> 23:43.708
Ryota is really,
really motherfucker.

23:43.708 --> 23:45.625
Yeah.

23:47.500 --> 23:49.500
Are you okay?

24:29.875 --> 24:31.417
Where is it?

24:31.417 --> 24:36.083
Fucking secret
Ted Bundy life,
you fucking creep.

24:39.041 --> 24:42.125
What are you smiling about,
you little whore?

24:42.125 --> 24:43.708
Delete.

24:43.708 --> 24:46.291
Oh, cool.
A tramp stamp.
A star. Wow.

24:46.291 --> 24:49.417
You're, like, having
all these original thoughts.

24:49.417 --> 24:52.792
Oh, hey, indie nipples.
Looking good. Deleted.

24:52.792 --> 24:56.291
Oh, and cool, holding
a Brussels Griffin dog.

24:56.291 --> 24:58.708
Suck my fucking dick.

24:58.708 --> 25:00.708
Jesus fucking Christ.

25:08.083 --> 25:10.583
Here's a nice
picture of me.

25:10.583 --> 25:13.291
And we're just gonna
