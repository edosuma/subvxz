00:01.102 --> 00:01.235
.

00:06.474 --> 00:07.375
(male narrator)
In the criminal justice system,

00:09.610 --> 00:11.979
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:12.012 --> 00:14.482
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:14.515 --> 00:16.384
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:16.417 --> 00:17.851
are members
of an elite squad

00:17.885 --> 00:20.020
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:20.054 --> 00:23.824
These are their stories.

00:23.857 --> 00:27.695
Love is long suffering
and kind.

00:27.728 --> 00:29.930
Love never rejoices
at evil,

00:29.963 --> 00:33.701
but rejoices
in the triumph of truth.

00:33.734 --> 00:35.002
Repeat,

00:35.035 --> 00:37.271
love bears
with all things.

00:37.305 --> 00:39.340
(all)
Love bears with all things.

00:39.373 --> 00:42.843
(man)
Ever trustful,
ever hopeful, ever patient.

00:42.876 --> 00:45.879
(all)
Ever trustful,
ever hopeful, ever patient.

00:45.913 --> 00:47.181
(man)
Love never fails.

00:47.215 --> 00:50.084
(all)
Love never fails.

00:50.118 --> 00:53.187
Noah Porter,
now we celebrate you,

00:53.221 --> 00:55.523
and we welcome you
into our community.

00:55.556 --> 00:58.025
All say, "You are
a blessed gift,

00:58.058 --> 00:59.693
and we give you
our blessings."

00:59.727 --> 01:01.929
(all)
You are a blessed gift,

01:01.962 --> 01:04.198
and we give you
our blessings.

01:04.232 --> 01:09.803
Noah, may the future
bring love to your heart,

01:09.837 --> 01:15.143
joy to your mind, and truth
from those sweet lips.

01:15.143 --> 01:16.677
I didn't know
you were a Unitarian, Sarge.

01:16.710 --> 01:18.212
Oh, I'm not.

01:18.246 --> 01:20.214
Actually, I didn't grow up
with any religion.

01:20.248 --> 01:22.316
I just wanted Noah to have
something that would ground him.

01:22.350 --> 01:24.952
Then rebel against when
he's a teenager, am I right?

01:24.985 --> 01:26.320
I get it.
I'm Catholic.

01:26.354 --> 01:27.855
No kidding?

01:27.888 --> 01:30.991
Come on, little man.
You did great.

01:33.861 --> 01:37.298
Michelle, I'm glad you
keep coming back to services.

01:37.331 --> 01:38.699
And you're working
your program?

01:38.732 --> 01:39.700
Yeah, every day.

01:39.733 --> 01:42.336
I'm up to my ninth step.

01:42.370 --> 01:44.738
Making amends.

01:44.772 --> 01:46.907
To my father.

01:46.940 --> 01:48.242
Michelle,
your father's in prison.

01:48.276 --> 01:51.879
- That's not your fault.
- Yes, it is.

01:51.912 --> 01:53.514
I lied to the police.

01:53.547 --> 01:55.416
It's not enough
to apologize.

01:55.449 --> 01:56.717
I'm supposed
to restore justice.

01:56.750 --> 01:57.751
When possible.

01:57.785 --> 01:59.187
Don't you know
that lawyer,

01:59.220 --> 02:03.324
the one who gets
innocent people out of jail?

02:05.826 --> 02:09.297
Sound it out.
It's T-H--

02:09.330 --> 02:10.298
- Throw.
- No, no.

02:10.331 --> 02:14.435
- The O-U is "ooh" here.
- Through.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.237
Nice, nice.

02:16.270 --> 02:18.672
(both)
I walk through...

02:18.706 --> 02:20.341
The valley
of the shadow--

02:20.374 --> 02:22.243
(man)
Visitor's here.

02:22.276 --> 02:25.313
Oh, you know, just
find me later, Jose, okay?

02:25.346 --> 02:29.250
(man)
No, Thompson,
for you.

02:29.283 --> 02:31.118
For me?

02:35.889 --> 02:39.827
Michelle?

02:39.860 --> 02:41.229
Why are you here?

02:41.229 --> 02:44.232
I brought someone
to meet you.

02:44.232 --> 02:46.033
Bayard Ellis,
Mr. Thompson.

02:46.066 --> 02:49.437
I work with
Project Innocence.

02:49.470 --> 02:54.442
I told him, Daddy,
the truth.

02:54.475 --> 02:56.577
That you never
raped me.

03:01.882 --> 03:03.284
[sighs]

03:08.289 --> 03:11.259
[dramatic music]

03:54.335 --> 03:54.468
.

03:55.469 --> 03:56.370
(Olivia)
We just had
a dedication ceremony.

03:57.971 --> 04:02.310
Such a sweet boy.
He has your smile.

04:02.343 --> 04:04.211
If everything
goes as planned,

04:04.312 --> 04:06.947
then the adoption will be
official in a month.

04:06.980 --> 04:08.316
Oh, well,
congratulations, Olivia.

04:08.316 --> 04:10.183
Thank you.

04:10.217 --> 04:12.185
But I know that you didn't
invite me to dinner

04:12.219 --> 04:15.523
to talk about Noah,
so let's have it.

04:15.556 --> 04:17.057
Reverend Scott asked me
to look into a case

04:17.090 --> 04:19.793
involving a congregant,
Michelle Thompson.

04:19.827 --> 04:21.695
Her father, Derek,

04:21.729 --> 04:24.565
was convicted of raping her
17 years ago when she was six.

04:24.598 --> 04:27.134
Convicted of raping
his own daughter?

04:27.167 --> 04:30.003
That's a tough case for Project
Innocence to get behind.

04:30.037 --> 04:32.039
(Bayard)
It is, but this case
was primarily

04:32.072 --> 04:33.841
made on Michelle's
testimony.

04:33.874 --> 04:36.644
Now, she's saying that she was
pressured by her mother to lie.

04:36.677 --> 04:37.845
She wants to recant.

04:37.878 --> 04:39.347
17 years
after the fact.

04:39.380 --> 04:41.582
Oh, she tried once
before as a teen.

04:41.615 --> 04:45.519
The original ADA and detective
argued against reopening.

04:45.553 --> 04:48.055
Michelle went off the deep end
after that--drugs, alcohol.

04:48.088 --> 04:51.759
She's recently
found sobriety.

04:51.792 --> 04:54.528
Hold on, so her recant
is part of a 12-step program?

04:54.562 --> 04:56.930
That's not the most reliable
indicator of the truth.

04:56.964 --> 04:58.766
Believe me.
I've seen that pink cloud

04:58.799 --> 05:01.001
"I forgive everyone"
effect too.

05:01.034 --> 05:05.005
That's why I need you
to investigate.

05:08.208 --> 05:11.011
Any DNA, forensics,
any corroboration?

05:11.044 --> 05:13.381
No, only--only her testimony

05:13.381 --> 05:15.616
and some inconclusive
medical symptoms.

05:15.649 --> 05:18.652
Her mother, who has
her own substance abuse history,

05:18.686 --> 05:19.853
made the initial
911 call.

05:19.887 --> 05:21.389
Did you talk
to the father?

05:21.389 --> 05:23.391
Oh, sure, up at Green Haven.
He's a model prisoner.

05:23.391 --> 05:25.125
I found him credible.

05:25.158 --> 05:28.028
He's maintained
his innocence for 17 years.

05:28.061 --> 05:31.131
It's hard enough to prove that
someone is innocent of a crime.

05:31.164 --> 05:32.866
It's harder, still,
to prove that that crime

05:32.900 --> 05:35.736
itself never occurred.

05:35.769 --> 05:38.238
So you thought of me.

05:38.271 --> 05:40.674
Indeed, I did.

05:40.708 --> 05:42.075
Bayard Ellis wants us

05:42.109 --> 05:43.977
to reopen
a 20-year-old incest rape?

05:44.011 --> 05:45.846
Let him do
the legwork.

05:45.879 --> 05:47.415
Look, he just wants us to see
if there's anything there.

05:47.448 --> 05:50.183
I mean, obviously, it's tough
to get a conviction reopened,

05:50.217 --> 05:51.519
but Bayard Ellis,
the guy's a legend.

05:51.552 --> 05:53.086
If he thinks
it's worth looking into...

05:53.120 --> 05:54.755
Look, I know Ellis
is your friend,

05:54.788 --> 05:57.157
but do we really
need to work a closed case?

05:57.190 --> 05:59.527
Nick, this isn't
out of friendship.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.228
And SVU didn't handle
the case.

06:01.261 --> 06:04.064
It was the local precinct
who hated Derek Thompson,

06:04.097 --> 06:05.433
who really
worked him over,

06:05.466 --> 06:06.900
and when he finally
got a lawyer--

06:06.934 --> 06:08.836
Let me guess.
First-year legal aide.

06:08.869 --> 06:11.238
It was worse than that:
it was some down on her luck,

06:11.271 --> 06:12.506
18-B rent-a-lawyer

06:12.540 --> 06:15.275
who could hardly pay
for her transcript copies.

06:15.308 --> 06:17.110
We're just gonna
vet the case.

06:17.144 --> 06:20.481
So the lead detective
was a guy named Ted McCormack,

06:20.514 --> 06:24.017
and the ADA was O'Dwyer,
none of whom I've met.

06:24.051 --> 06:26.687
Before your time, wow.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.490
You missing
Staten Island, Carisi?

06:29.523 --> 06:32.493
But there is somebody
coming back to town who was here

06:32.526 --> 06:35.829
when they built the place.

06:35.863 --> 06:38.331
(Donald)
Eileen's grandkids--
we spent the winter with them

06:38.365 --> 06:41.101
in Fort Lauderdale
after the cruise.

06:41.134 --> 06:43.103
You know, I never thought
I would say it,

06:43.136 --> 06:46.507
but turns out
there's more to life than NYPD.

06:46.540 --> 06:48.175
Oh, yeah?

06:48.208 --> 06:49.943
Well, the place
is falling apart without you.

06:49.977 --> 06:51.278
- Thanks, Nick.
- Okay, come on.

06:51.311 --> 06:53.313
No more chitchat.
Why are we here?

06:53.346 --> 06:54.715
You have a victim
who wants to recant?

06:54.748 --> 06:56.349
17 years later.

06:56.383 --> 06:58.952
Between her ninth step, Reverend
Curtis, and Bayard Ellis,

06:58.986 --> 07:01.288
she's convinced the cops
and the DA blew the case.

07:01.321 --> 07:02.890
It wasn't SVU.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.525
It was up at your old house,
the 2-7,

07:04.558 --> 07:06.594
and we can't seem to get
in touch with this detective

07:06.627 --> 07:08.862
who caught the case,
Ted McCormack.

07:08.896 --> 07:10.130
Ted McCormack.

07:10.163 --> 07:11.699
Yeah, well,
you may have a problem.

07:11.732 --> 07:13.200
What, you knew
McCormack?

07:13.233 --> 07:15.703
Unfortunately, the guy
got bounced around a lot.

07:15.736 --> 07:17.304
Never met a corner
he didn't cut.

07:17.337 --> 07:20.140
Okay, any chance
you remember the DA,

07:20.173 --> 07:22.209
O'Dwyer, Kenneth O'Dwyer?

07:22.242 --> 07:23.877
O'Dwyer?

07:23.911 --> 07:25.646
That must've been
an early case of his.

07:25.679 --> 07:29.149
He had family connections,
got his hands dirty for a year,

07:29.182 --> 07:32.219
and then they bumped him up
to white collar.

07:32.252 --> 07:33.821
What does he say
about this?

07:33.854 --> 07:35.255
- Haven't called him yet.
- Okay, good.

07:35.288 --> 07:38.291
Hold off.
He rides a high horse.

07:38.325 --> 07:41.228
I know an old lifer
back at the 2-7.

07:41.261 --> 07:46.133
If I buy him lunch,
he'll dish like a gossip girl.

07:46.166 --> 07:47.968
My mama was out.

07:48.001 --> 07:50.638
She was drinking and drugging,
and my dad came home from work,

07:50.671 --> 07:52.640
saw me and my baby brother
making a mess.

07:52.673 --> 07:55.275
I tried to make hot dogs
and burned myself.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.678
- He got angry.
- At you?

07:57.711 --> 07:59.179
You shouldn't have
been cooking at six.

07:59.212 --> 08:00.881
Well, that's
what my dad said.

08:00.914 --> 08:03.951
My brother was crying.
He was hungry.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.553
Well, you tried.

08:05.553 --> 08:08.689
And Daddy asked where
Mama was, if she was--

08:08.722 --> 08:12.560
if she was drinking,
and he put us to bed.

08:12.593 --> 08:17.931
When she got home, they
started screaming at each other.

08:17.965 --> 08:20.300
I was crying,
so Mama came in.

08:20.333 --> 08:24.204
I told her my hand got burnt,
and she looked at me strange

08:24.237 --> 08:28.241
and said, "What did
your daddy do to you?"

08:30.811 --> 08:33.747
Do you remember
how you responded?

08:33.781 --> 08:35.949
Yeah.

08:35.983 --> 08:37.718
I did not want her
to be mad at me,

08:37.751 --> 08:42.389
so I said
it was daddy's fault,

08:42.422 --> 08:45.225
and she kept
asking questions.

08:45.258 --> 08:47.961
What else did he do?
Did he touch me down there?

08:47.995 --> 08:53.433
And every time I said no,
she got angry, so--

08:53.466 --> 08:55.302
so I finally
said yes.

09:00.273 --> 09:02.009
The next morning,
my daddy went to work.

09:02.042 --> 09:04.912
She called
the police.

09:09.449 --> 09:13.353
Okay, so you're saying
that your father never

09:13.386 --> 09:15.222
touched you at all
that night.

09:15.255 --> 09:19.426
No, he yelled
and scared me, but no.

09:19.459 --> 09:21.094
Okay, Michelle,
you repeated the story

09:21.128 --> 09:24.497
to the detective,
the DA, to the jury.

09:24.531 --> 09:26.934
Yeah, my mama said I had
to keep saying it,

09:26.967 --> 09:28.636
or people would be mad
at me for lying.

09:28.636 --> 09:33.540
Look, I just wanted
everyone to be quiet.

09:33.641 --> 09:37.544
Nothing happened
that night.

09:37.645 --> 09:39.880
I swear.

09:44.484 --> 09:45.853
That man's a curse.

09:45.886 --> 09:47.354
- Is he dead?
- He's not dead, ma'am.

09:47.387 --> 09:49.556
Maybe we could come up.
We could ask you some questions.

09:49.657 --> 09:51.258
I'm not letting
no police up in my house.

09:51.291 --> 09:52.960
What is this?
He's not getting out, is he?

09:52.993 --> 09:55.428
- We're looking into the case.
- He put you up to that?

09:55.462 --> 09:58.065
No, actually,
your daughter Michelle did.

09:58.098 --> 10:02.569
What is it this week?
She found Jesus?

10:02.602 --> 10:04.404
She finished looking
for the truth

10:04.437 --> 10:06.373
down at the bottom
of that bottle?

10:06.406 --> 10:09.442
You know, you wait a week,
she'll change her mind.

10:09.476 --> 10:11.278
She and her brother
are both messed up

10:11.311 --> 10:14.982
because of their father.

10:15.015 --> 10:16.750
I'm done talking.

10:16.784 --> 10:18.485
I'm late for work.

10:20.988 --> 10:23.156
She's right back
in that apartment, 17 years ago.

10:23.190 --> 10:24.624
Yeah.

10:24.658 --> 10:26.794
She's holding on so tight
to the story she told then.

10:26.827 --> 10:28.428
It's almost like
she has to.

10:28.461 --> 10:30.430
Well, this is why
I don't like reopening cases.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.499
It's tough enough to figure out
at the time.

10:32.532 --> 10:34.067
All these years later?

10:34.101 --> 10:36.269
How are we
ever gonna know?

10:41.008 --> 10:43.410
(Derek)
I never touched my little girl.

10:43.443 --> 10:46.446
My wife lied,
and she made Michelle lie.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.816
There a reason your wife would
do that to you, Mr. Thompson?

10:48.849 --> 10:51.451
You know, Audrey
was an addict back then.

10:51.484 --> 10:54.621
She used to come home
with this wild look in her eye.

10:54.654 --> 10:56.189
It was dangerous.

10:56.223 --> 10:58.091
But most of the time,
I knew to keep out of her way.

10:58.125 --> 10:59.592
But not that night.

10:59.626 --> 11:01.729
No, she left
the kids alone.

11:01.762 --> 11:03.530
They could've burned
the house down.

11:03.563 --> 11:05.999
All right, so you're saying
your wife made up a story

11:06.033 --> 11:08.035
about you raping Michelle,
convinced her to lie,

11:08.068 --> 11:10.537
and had you put in prison
because of a marital fight?

11:10.570 --> 11:12.605
Don't you think
I've been asking myself

11:12.639 --> 11:14.041
that for the last
17 years?

11:14.074 --> 11:15.408
Yeah, it's time
enough to make up

11:15.442 --> 11:16.744
a lot of excuses
for yourself.

11:16.744 --> 11:18.245
Yeah, but there
was no evidence.

11:18.278 --> 11:19.546
There were bruises.
She was crying.

11:19.579 --> 11:22.750
Not because of me.

11:22.750 --> 11:24.451
Well, the police asked
why there was semen

11:24.484 --> 11:25.585
on your daughter's
pajamas.

11:25.618 --> 11:27.020
You said your wife
had planted it.

11:27.054 --> 11:28.756
- There was no semen.
- Exactly.

11:28.789 --> 11:32.525
If you were innocent,
why didn't you just say that?

11:32.559 --> 11:34.962
Because the police
tricked me,

11:34.995 --> 11:36.764
like you're trying
to trick me right now.

11:36.764 --> 11:38.899
We're not trying
to trick you.

11:38.932 --> 11:41.234
We just want to know your side
of the story.

11:41.268 --> 11:44.972
You know, I've kept my back
to the wall in here.

11:45.005 --> 11:47.207
I've tried to be
a good father.

11:47.240 --> 11:48.641
How so?

11:48.675 --> 11:51.478
'Cause I write to Will
and Michelle every week,

11:51.511 --> 11:55.783
and I tell them
that I love them.

11:55.783 --> 11:57.951
Their mother, Audrey, she's
never been there for them, man.

11:57.985 --> 12:01.221
I'm still their father.

12:01.254 --> 12:03.590
My daughter has admitted

12:03.623 --> 12:07.594
that this whole story
was made up.

12:17.905 --> 12:18.038
.

12:18.872 --> 12:19.907
It's a real honor to meet you,
Counselor Ellis, sir.

12:21.809 --> 12:23.210
- Call me Bayard.
- Okay, wow.

12:23.243 --> 12:25.813
Okay, Carisi, about the meeting
with Derek Thompson?

12:25.846 --> 12:27.714
Right, right,
he maintains his innocence,

12:27.815 --> 12:29.416
which is to be expected,

12:29.449 --> 12:30.884
but his version of that night
does match up with Michelle's.

12:30.918 --> 12:32.853
- And she seemed credible.
- Yeah.

12:32.886 --> 12:35.222
We're gonna need more than that
to convince the judge to reopen.

12:35.255 --> 12:36.556
The detective
on the case,

12:36.589 --> 12:38.291
Ted McCormack,
has retired to Florida.

12:38.325 --> 12:40.527
I've left more than a few
messages, but no call back yet.

12:40.560 --> 12:42.395
Look who I picked up
on the street.

12:42.429 --> 12:44.731
- Captain.
- Amanda, it's good to see you.

12:44.832 --> 12:46.834
So Captain Cragen,
Councilor Ellis.

12:46.834 --> 12:48.235
You two remember
each other.

12:48.268 --> 12:49.502
And this is Carisi.

12:49.536 --> 12:51.571
- Call me Sonny.
- No one else does.

12:51.604 --> 12:54.074
(Olivia)
Captain Cragen has
some contacts up at the 2-7.

12:54.107 --> 12:56.409
I asked him
to look into this.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.078
And you found
something?

12:58.111 --> 13:00.280
No, I didn't, and I'm not
showing you this,

13:00.313 --> 13:02.983
but it is addressed
to Detective McCormack

13:03.016 --> 13:04.651
and ADA O'Dwyer.

13:04.684 --> 13:07.554
So if you were
to request it from his office

13:07.587 --> 13:10.157
because maybe you saw it
in a precinct evidence log,

13:10.190 --> 13:11.925
he would have
to produce it.

13:11.959 --> 13:13.927
And what is this
that you're not showing us?

13:13.961 --> 13:16.263
(Nick)
A letter Michelle's
first grade teacher wrote.

13:16.296 --> 13:17.730
It says Michelle
came to her crying

13:17.764 --> 13:19.532
because her mother
made her lie to the police.

13:19.566 --> 13:21.534
And this letter was sent
before the trial started?

13:21.568 --> 13:23.436
Counselor, if I may,

13:23.470 --> 13:26.373
if we can prove that the DA
had this potentially exculpatory

13:26.406 --> 13:28.175
evidence and didn't share it
with the defense,

13:28.208 --> 13:29.442
that's a slam dunk, right?

13:29.476 --> 13:32.445
Now, just hold
your horses there, Sonny.

13:32.479 --> 13:35.048
It's possible O'Dwyer
did forward the letter.

13:35.082 --> 13:37.017
And Thompson's defense
just didn't use it?

13:37.050 --> 13:38.685
Come on.
This is awesome.

13:38.718 --> 13:42.555
This means justice delayed does
not have to mean justice denied.

13:42.589 --> 13:46.159
So you're new here.

13:49.496 --> 13:51.464
(O'Dwyer)
Tamsin, thank you.

13:51.498 --> 13:52.699
This won't take long.

13:52.732 --> 13:54.701
Bayard Ellis,
how's life in Brooklyn?

13:54.734 --> 13:55.936
Nice to see you,
Counselor.

13:55.969 --> 13:57.905
This is
Sergeant Benson.

13:57.938 --> 14:00.407
- I've heard good things.
- Well, then we're even.

14:00.440 --> 14:01.909
The Thompson case.

14:01.909 --> 14:03.543
My first win
as lead prosecutor.

14:03.576 --> 14:06.279
The jury deliberated
for half an hour,

14:06.313 --> 14:08.615
found him guilty on all charges,
open and shut.

14:08.648 --> 14:11.919
Oh, you know me, Kenneth.
Absolutes give me hives.

14:11.919 --> 14:13.453
The jury
believed the victim.

14:13.486 --> 14:15.555
I would think that would give
you comfort, Sergeant.

14:15.588 --> 14:18.058
Usually, it does,
but the girl is now claiming

14:18.091 --> 14:21.028
that she was forced
to lie by her mother.

14:21.061 --> 14:22.662
Again?

14:22.695 --> 14:24.397
So you knew that she had
recanted before?

14:24.431 --> 14:25.999
As a teenager,
she came to the police.

14:26.033 --> 14:28.368
She said
she was sorry.

14:28.401 --> 14:30.370
The detective thought
she might've been on drugs.

14:30.403 --> 14:31.804
He didn't find
her credible.

14:31.838 --> 14:33.941
But Michelle also told
her first grade teacher

14:33.941 --> 14:36.509
that she lied, and that
was before the trial.

14:36.543 --> 14:38.211
Now, the teacher
wrote a letter

14:38.245 --> 14:40.480
to you and Detective McCormack
detailing the disclosure.

14:40.513 --> 14:42.415
I don't need to tell you
that such a letter

14:42.449 --> 14:43.583
would be exculpatory.

14:43.616 --> 14:46.319
- No, you don't.
- I read the transcript.

14:46.353 --> 14:48.388
Her letter was never mentioned
by the defense.

14:48.421 --> 14:50.590
Well, you should ask
the defense about that.

14:50.623 --> 14:53.526
I hope you're not accusing me
of prosecutorial misconduct.

14:53.560 --> 14:56.096
Are you saying you turned
that letter over to the defense?

14:56.129 --> 14:57.497
Absolutely.

14:57.530 --> 14:59.967
In 1998, the attorney's name
was Cassie Muir,

14:59.967 --> 15:02.802
and I have no idea why
she didn't bring it up at trial.

15:02.835 --> 15:04.972
Derek Thompson
raped his daughter.

15:04.972 --> 15:06.573
If he has regrets
about that now,

15:06.606 --> 15:10.610
if his daughter has decided
she suddenly misses him,

15:10.643 --> 15:14.214
that's a family tragedy, but
it doesn't make him innocent.

15:19.019 --> 15:20.620
(Sonny)
We spoke on the phone,
Ms. Muir.

15:20.653 --> 15:22.355
The Derek Thompson case.

15:22.389 --> 15:26.259
Oh, my experience
as a practicing lawyer

15:26.293 --> 15:27.627
is part of my past

15:27.660 --> 15:30.263
I choose to revisit
as seldom as possible.

15:30.297 --> 15:31.864
(Amanda)
So you don't practice
anymore?

15:31.898 --> 15:34.801
No, I did get
disbarred in '09,

15:34.834 --> 15:36.803
although they never
filed a complaint.

15:36.836 --> 15:38.638
They said they sent
a certified letter,

15:38.671 --> 15:41.308
but I never got it,
so by the time I could fight it,

15:41.341 --> 15:43.010
they'd already made up
their minds.

15:43.010 --> 15:46.546
Okay, well, we're here
about a different letter.

15:46.579 --> 15:49.516
Oh, this is
about the Derek Thompson case.

15:49.549 --> 15:52.652
- So you do remember?
- Oh, of course I do.

15:52.685 --> 15:55.688
The allegations
were horrific,

15:55.722 --> 15:59.692
but even a pedophile
is entitled to a defense.

15:59.726 --> 16:01.128
Do you think
he was guilty?

16:01.161 --> 16:03.196
Oh, honey,
they were all guilty.

16:03.230 --> 16:04.764
Okay.
Well, we found this letter.

16:04.797 --> 16:06.633
It's from Michelle's
first grade teacher.

16:06.666 --> 16:08.935
It says that her mother
was coaching her to lie.

16:09.036 --> 16:11.204
Uh-huh.

16:11.238 --> 16:15.208
So do you remember getting that
from the DA's office?

16:15.242 --> 16:18.378
Oh, Ken O'Dwyer and I
may have been adversaries,

16:18.411 --> 16:21.648
but he always treated me
with respect, so yes, of course,

16:21.681 --> 16:23.950
I remember getting
that letter.

16:24.051 --> 16:26.486
The teacher told us that
you never followed up with her.

16:26.519 --> 16:29.656
Can you tell us why?

16:29.689 --> 16:31.758
Well, I'm sure
I had a good reason.

16:31.791 --> 16:33.293
You must put a letter

16:33.326 --> 16:36.896
like that in the context
of your whole defense.

16:36.929 --> 16:38.931
Juries get upset.

16:38.965 --> 16:43.070
It could backfire if you go
at a young girl too hard.

16:47.974 --> 16:49.809
So Daddy's attorney
had that letter?

16:49.842 --> 16:51.478
She never even tried
to talk

16:51.511 --> 16:52.845
to your teacher,
Mrs. Morgan.

16:52.879 --> 16:54.781
Your teacher also says
that she sent a letter

16:54.814 --> 16:56.849
to the lead detective.

16:56.883 --> 16:58.418
So what do we do now?

16:58.451 --> 17:00.187
I'll be filing a motion
for 440 hearing

17:00.220 --> 17:02.755
on grounds of ineffective
assistance of counsel.

17:02.789 --> 17:05.825
The best case scenario--
your conviction is vacated,

17:05.858 --> 17:07.694
and O'Dwyer agrees
to drop the charges.

17:07.727 --> 17:10.497
O'Dwyer.
He hates me.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.365
I can't get my hopes up
on a scenario.

17:12.399 --> 17:13.833
(Bayard)
I can't promise
an outcome,

17:13.866 --> 17:15.702
but Judge Rosenbaum
is hearing the case.

17:15.735 --> 17:18.671
She's a progressive, outspoken
on reforming the system.

17:18.705 --> 17:21.941
Her track record tends to favor
the defense in appeals.

17:21.974 --> 17:24.844
Mr. Ellis is telling us
we got a good shot.

17:24.877 --> 17:28.248
Just have faith,
Daddy.

17:28.281 --> 17:30.117
I couldn't have
said it better myself.

17:33.453 --> 17:35.922
Yeah.

17:38.425 --> 17:40.693
Counselor Ellis.

17:40.727 --> 17:43.130
Oh, you look cheerful
considering Judge Rosenbaum

17:43.130 --> 17:45.031
is about to vacate all charges
against my client.

17:45.132 --> 17:46.533
You haven't heard?

17:46.566 --> 17:48.735
Judge Rosenbaum suffered
a mini-stroke last night.

17:48.768 --> 17:50.137
It's a shame.

17:50.137 --> 17:51.904
Yes, it is.
I'm willing to postpone.

17:51.938 --> 17:53.606
There's no telling
when she'll be back.

17:53.640 --> 17:56.143
The case has already been
reassigned--Bertuccio.

17:56.143 --> 18:00.613
Win some,
lose some, Bayard.

18:00.647 --> 18:02.815
Hey, everything
all right?

18:02.849 --> 18:04.617
There's been a change
in the judge for the case

18:04.651 --> 18:07.187
that might not
be in our favor.

18:07.220 --> 18:10.623
Bayard, this is
Michelle's brother, Will.

18:10.657 --> 18:11.891
So glad
that you're here.

18:11.924 --> 18:17.630
Thank you
for helping my father.

18:17.664 --> 18:19.599
(man)
All rise.

18:23.736 --> 18:25.472
Thank you all
for waiting,

18:25.505 --> 18:27.474
and you may be seated.

18:27.507 --> 18:29.041
Approach,
Your Honor?

18:29.075 --> 18:34.181
Whatever you need,
Mr. Ellis.

18:34.214 --> 18:35.648
Your Honor,
it's my understanding

18:35.682 --> 18:37.049
that you were just
assigned this case.

18:37.083 --> 18:38.418
Might I suggest
a postponement?

18:38.451 --> 18:40.220
Why?
Who's not prepared?

18:40.253 --> 18:42.855
The people are,
Your Honor.

18:42.889 --> 18:45.091
Well, I read
the paperwork.

18:45.192 --> 18:46.259
I'm good.

18:46.293 --> 18:48.995
Mr. Ellis, you need
a postponement?

18:49.028 --> 18:50.697
No, Your Honor.

18:50.730 --> 18:54.000
Well, then step back.

18:54.033 --> 18:55.702
People
versus Derek Thompson.

18:55.735 --> 18:57.604
- I have a 440 motion.
- Your Honor.

18:57.637 --> 18:59.906
We have a letter probative
of the defendant's innocence

18:59.939 --> 19:01.641
that was never shown
to the jury by defense.

19:01.674 --> 19:03.476
(Bertuccio)
And that's in the file,
Mr. Ellis?

19:03.510 --> 19:05.212
- Mm-hmm.
- Ah.

19:05.212 --> 19:07.347
A letter from Ms. Thompson's
first grade teacher.

19:07.380 --> 19:08.848
Mr. O'Dwyer?

19:08.881 --> 19:10.683
Your Honor, counsel
did indeed have this letter

19:10.717 --> 19:12.419
and chose not
to introduce it.

19:12.452 --> 19:14.921
I suspect the judge
would've ruled it as hearsay.

19:14.954 --> 19:16.456
Even if it were admitted,

19:16.489 --> 19:17.757
it strains credulity
it would've

19:17.790 --> 19:20.993
swayed that jury's unanimous
decision on all counts.

19:21.027 --> 19:22.695
All right,
just to be clear,

19:22.729 --> 19:25.398
she told her teacher she was
coached by her mother to lie?

19:25.432 --> 19:28.067
(Bayard)
A recantation
she adamantly maintains.

19:28.100 --> 19:30.637
But she testified
to the rape at trial

19:30.670 --> 19:31.938
after she spoke
to the teacher.

19:31.971 --> 19:33.573
We believe that testimony
at trial

19:33.606 --> 19:37.977
was given
under maternal pressure.

19:38.010 --> 19:40.247
Looking at this letter,
it may have been sufficient

19:40.280 --> 19:42.949
to cast reasonable doubt
on her testimony.

19:42.982 --> 19:46.453
However, it was up
to the defense to introduce it,

19:46.486 --> 19:48.788
and I'm curious as to why
the defendant didn't bring up

19:48.821 --> 19:50.990
the issue of inadequate counsel
at the time.

19:51.023 --> 19:53.593
My fear
is that this appeal

19:53.626 --> 19:56.496
is conveniently timed
to the victim's recent recant.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.998
The failure
to introduce this letter

19:59.031 --> 20:03.169
alone does not rise to the level
of lack of effective counsel.

20:03.202 --> 20:05.305
The motion is denied.

20:05.338 --> 20:06.906
Mr. Thompson,

20:06.939 --> 20:12.011
you are remanded back
to Green Haven Correctional,

20:12.044 --> 20:14.314
and this hearing
is adjourned.

20:14.347 --> 20:17.917
Daddy, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

20:17.950 --> 20:19.185
Look, you got to
do something.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.454
- Michelle, he tried.
- Another appeal.

20:21.488 --> 20:22.622
I don't know
that we can.

20:22.655 --> 20:25.191
No. No.
You got my hopes up.

20:25.224 --> 20:26.426
You got my Daddy's
hopes up,

20:26.459 --> 20:28.127
my little brother's
for nothing.

20:43.410 --> 20:43.543
.

20:45.678 --> 20:46.178
Happy hour
started early?

20:47.614 --> 20:49.248
What she's having.

20:49.282 --> 20:50.450
No good deed.

20:50.483 --> 20:52.084
- Hmm.
- How's Michelle?

20:52.118 --> 20:53.185
Reverend Curtis
is with her.

20:53.219 --> 20:54.887
He doesn't want
her to spiral down.

20:54.921 --> 20:57.089
- So the case is dead?
- It's on life support.

20:57.123 --> 20:59.091
We've exhausted
the state appeals.

20:59.125 --> 21:02.695
The last recourse is to file a
Federal Habeas Corpus petition.

21:02.729 --> 21:04.464
You'd need
new evidence for that.

21:04.497 --> 21:06.366
Well, if there is any,
I don't know where it's been

21:06.399 --> 21:07.967
hiding all this time.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.870
Amaro just texted.
McCormack's in town.

21:10.903 --> 21:12.339
The original detective.

21:12.339 --> 21:13.806
I thought he wasn't
returning our calls.

21:13.840 --> 21:15.475
He wasn't.
Cragen reached out.

21:15.508 --> 21:19.379
He said he was worried
that some nutjob, Bayard Ellis,

21:19.412 --> 21:22.014
was looking
to reopen the case.

21:22.048 --> 21:25.885
So McCormack's coming
in to help SVU

21:25.918 --> 21:30.357
make sure
it stays buried?

21:30.390 --> 21:31.991
(Donald)
It's good
to see you, Ted.

21:32.024 --> 21:33.192
I didn't know
if you'd remember me.

21:33.225 --> 21:34.961
Captain Cragen.

21:34.994 --> 21:36.996
We used to call you
Captain Crunch back in the day.

21:37.029 --> 21:39.499
They didn't make you for SVU.
How long'd you last?

21:39.532 --> 21:41.067
15 years.

21:41.100 --> 21:45.472
Wow, no kidding?
Who's the kid?

21:45.505 --> 21:46.873
Nick Amaro.

21:46.906 --> 21:48.375
Captain taught me
everything I know.

21:48.375 --> 21:51.378
Must not have
taken very long.

21:51.378 --> 21:53.380
Hey, so what can
you tell us about

21:53.413 --> 21:56.182
this piece of crap,
Derek Thompson?

21:56.215 --> 21:58.250
He's the lowest
of the low.

21:58.284 --> 22:00.219
Did his own daughter.

22:00.252 --> 22:01.388
Project Innocence, huh?

22:01.388 --> 22:02.955
I know they're
bleeding hearts,

22:02.989 --> 22:04.924
but you'd think
they'd steer clear.

22:04.957 --> 22:06.393
Well, his daughter
hit bottom,

22:06.393 --> 22:09.396
found Jesus, and the right
Reverend Curtis Scott.

22:09.396 --> 22:12.399
Ah, that charlatan.

22:12.432 --> 22:13.966
- Now I get it.
- He plays Ellis.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.135
Ellis plays his new friends
at City Hall--

22:16.168 --> 22:19.472
- And here we are.
- This city.

22:19.506 --> 22:25.144
Same crap, different century.
So what's going on?

22:25.177 --> 22:27.547
Well...

22:27.580 --> 22:31.484
The girl is claiming
that her mother made her lie.

22:31.518 --> 22:34.186
Audrey?
She would never.

22:34.220 --> 22:35.522
She had her troubles,

22:35.555 --> 22:37.624
but she was just trying
to protect those kids

22:37.657 --> 22:39.191
from that pedophile.

22:39.225 --> 22:42.128
She's all broken up
about this.

22:42.161 --> 22:44.263
So you spoke
to Audrey Thompson?

22:44.296 --> 22:46.132
Yeah.

22:46.165 --> 22:49.936
I mean, she called me when
you guys started poking around.

22:49.969 --> 22:51.438
After what she
went through,

22:51.471 --> 22:54.474
she still looks to me
when she needs a reality check.

22:54.507 --> 22:57.444
So you stayed in touch
after the case.

22:57.477 --> 22:58.945
And before.

22:58.978 --> 23:00.447
I broke up
domestic disputes

23:00.480 --> 23:02.214
there more times
than I can count.

23:02.248 --> 23:04.584
The guy
had a history.

23:04.617 --> 23:09.556
Escalated from slapping his wife
around to raping his kid.

23:09.589 --> 23:11.558
Well, his defense
found some letter

23:11.591 --> 23:15.361
sent to you from a teacher
saying Audrey made Michelle lie.

23:15.462 --> 23:17.964
Not a chance.

23:17.997 --> 23:21.367
Derek has made a career
out of convincing that poor kid

23:21.468 --> 23:24.303
he didn't do to her
what he did.

23:24.336 --> 23:26.573
And now
she's recanting.

23:26.606 --> 23:32.479
It shows you what a sick,
controlling waste of life he is.

23:32.512 --> 23:34.747
It's what we figured.

23:34.781 --> 23:36.148
Okay, Ted.
Thanks again.

23:36.182 --> 23:37.484
All right.

23:37.484 --> 23:39.619
Either of you guys
make it down to Florida,

23:39.652 --> 23:41.220
I'll take you
deep sea fishing, huh?

23:41.253 --> 23:43.923
Florida--somehow
I never make it there.

23:43.956 --> 23:45.492
Hey, it was good talking
to you, Nick.

23:45.525 --> 23:47.560
I'd like to stick around,
but Eileen

23:47.594 --> 23:49.496
has roped me
into a matinee.

23:49.529 --> 23:50.863
Good luck, Captain.

23:55.367 --> 23:57.504
So the detective
working the case keeps in touch

23:57.537 --> 23:59.071
with the ex-wife
of the accused?

23:59.105 --> 24:00.507
It's awfully cozy.

24:00.507 --> 24:01.774
Well, how many domestics
did he respond to?

24:01.808 --> 24:03.142
(Amanda)
Three.

24:03.175 --> 24:05.044
The last one,
a week before the accusation.

24:05.077 --> 24:06.979
What do we know about
McCormack's personal life?

24:07.013 --> 24:08.948
Well, I'm gonna guess drinking,
messy home situation.

24:08.981 --> 24:10.750
Yup, his wife
filed for a divorce

24:10.783 --> 24:11.818
two years
after the case.

24:11.851 --> 24:13.119
She died a year ago.

24:13.152 --> 24:14.787
Can you pull up
that divorce petition?

24:14.821 --> 24:16.623
I'm already on it.

24:16.656 --> 24:19.125
(Amanda)
Yeah, look.
Here we go.

24:19.158 --> 24:21.628
Grounds cited:
174, adultery.

24:21.661 --> 24:25.732
Co-respondent,
Audrey Thompson.

24:25.765 --> 24:28.334
So the detective on the case
was sleeping

24:28.367 --> 24:31.003
with the wife of the guy
he arrested.

24:31.037 --> 24:33.439
That might've been good
for a jury to know, right?

24:33.540 --> 24:35.407
New evidence.
Am I right, counselor?

24:35.441 --> 24:37.109
Yeah. it's a start,

24:37.143 --> 24:38.811
but we'd need to establish
the relationship

24:38.845 --> 24:40.179
began before the trial.

24:40.212 --> 24:41.914
Oh, McCormack
won't come clean on that.

24:41.948 --> 24:43.015
And hotbox Audrey
won't either.

24:43.049 --> 24:45.251
Michelle and Will,
six and four.

24:45.284 --> 24:47.019
- Pretty young.
- You'd be surprised.

24:47.053 --> 24:49.121
Kids pick up
on more than you realize.

24:49.155 --> 24:50.823
Michelle's fragile
as it is.

24:50.857 --> 24:53.660
Who wants to ask her
these kinds of questions?

24:58.731 --> 25:00.567
(Will)
Detective McCormack?

25:00.567 --> 25:03.102
Yeah, he came around a lot
when Dad went away.

25:03.135 --> 25:05.104
He'd come
to your apartment?

25:05.137 --> 25:07.206
Yeah, Mama said
he was looking after us.

25:07.239 --> 25:09.909
I just thought
that's what cops did.

25:09.942 --> 25:12.211
Do you remember
the first time you met him?

25:12.244 --> 25:14.714
- No.
- I do.

25:14.747 --> 25:18.585
Before Christmas,
Mama and Daddy were fighting.

25:18.585 --> 25:22.755
She knocked the tree over,
and Daddy shoved her away.

25:22.789 --> 25:24.190
She called 911.

25:24.223 --> 25:25.592
And Detective
McCormack responded.

25:25.625 --> 25:26.593
Yeah.

25:26.626 --> 25:28.027
Do you remember anything

25:28.060 --> 25:30.129
about the way he behaved
around your mother?

25:30.162 --> 25:34.066
She was crying.
I think he hugged her.

25:34.100 --> 25:38.605
Okay, do you remember any other
physical contact between them?

25:40.506 --> 25:43.109
Why are you
asking us this?

25:43.142 --> 25:45.712
Sergeant Benson
may have found evidence

25:45.745 --> 25:51.651
that your mother was involved
with Detective McCormack.

25:51.684 --> 25:54.754
They were together?

25:54.787 --> 25:56.055
Oh, my God.

25:56.088 --> 25:59.726
We're not sure.

25:59.759 --> 26:01.127
Do you either of you

26:01.160 --> 26:04.530
remember a time when
they may have left together?

26:04.631 --> 26:08.735
Yeah, she went away
once for a weekend.

26:08.768 --> 26:10.336
It was after Daddy
was in jail.

26:10.369 --> 26:13.139
I remember
we went to Grandma's.

26:13.172 --> 26:14.340
Oh, yeah,
she brought us back

26:14.373 --> 26:17.343
the snow globe
and the pink flamingo.

26:17.376 --> 26:20.179
So this is while
your father was in jail,

26:20.212 --> 26:25.551
but before the trial.

26:25.652 --> 26:29.255
I'm trying to remember.

26:29.288 --> 26:30.389
I don't know.

26:30.422 --> 26:32.024
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

26:32.058 --> 26:34.193
It's okay.

26:34.226 --> 26:36.095
I know
this is difficult.

26:41.668 --> 26:43.235
(Nick)
So Ted and Audrey

26:43.269 --> 26:45.437
had known each other six months
by the time of the trial.

26:45.471 --> 26:47.674
Can we prove that
the relationship was romantic?

26:47.707 --> 26:49.275
Yeah, we can prove
they were both in Key West

26:49.308 --> 26:50.843
on the same weekend in May.

26:50.877 --> 26:52.244
(Bayard)
Go on.

26:52.278 --> 26:53.946
That weekend, Detective
McCormack was picking up a perp

26:53.980 --> 26:55.314
at Monroe County
Detention.

26:55.347 --> 26:57.116
Oh, weekend getaway
on the taxpayer's dime.

26:57.149 --> 26:58.417
We know Audrey
was there how?

26:58.450 --> 27:00.019
I called the Monroe
County Sheriff's Office.

27:00.052 --> 27:01.688
Guess who was charged with

27:01.688 --> 27:04.290
disorderly intoxication
that same weekend?

27:04.323 --> 27:05.758
- Audrey Thompson.
- Yeah.

27:05.792 --> 27:07.326
She pleaded down
to a dis-con the next day.

27:07.359 --> 27:09.428
My guess, that's
when McCormack intervened.

27:09.461 --> 27:11.698
So these two
were hooking up

27:11.698 --> 27:13.532
while Derek Thompson
is awaiting trial.

27:13.565 --> 27:15.301
They railroaded
him, Sarge.

27:15.334 --> 27:16.803
I mean, that's got
to be enough

27:16.836 --> 27:18.304
for a Federal Habeas Corpus,
am I right?

27:18.337 --> 27:19.706
I mean, maybe
even ADA O'Dwyer

27:19.706 --> 27:21.207
just drops the charges
altogether.

27:29.882 --> 27:30.016
.

27:30.817 --> 27:31.851
(Bayard)
Audrey Jones was in Key West
the same weekend

27:33.152 --> 27:34.721
as Detective McCormack

27:34.721 --> 27:36.789
one month prior
to Derek Thompson's trial.

27:36.823 --> 27:38.925
That's called a coincidence,
not a conspiracy.

27:38.958 --> 27:40.793
The detective was there
on police business.

27:40.827 --> 27:42.594
(Bayard)
Well, perhaps,
but we believe

27:42.628 --> 27:44.263
that police business
provided him the cover

27:44.296 --> 27:46.598
to fly in Ms. Jones
for a romantic weekend.

27:46.632 --> 27:47.834
There's absolutely
no proof of that.

27:47.867 --> 27:49.101
(Bayard)
It's just common sense.

27:49.135 --> 27:51.570
Audrey Jones was named
as the sole co-respondent

27:51.603 --> 27:53.740
in Nora McCormack's
divorce papers.

27:53.740 --> 27:55.775
Detective McCormack never
should've been allowed

27:55.808 --> 27:57.977
to testify against the man
that he was cuckolding.

27:58.010 --> 27:59.045
The defense was deprived

27:59.078 --> 28:02.081
the opportunity
to question his motive.

28:04.150 --> 28:06.352
I agree with you,
Mr. Ellis.

28:06.385 --> 28:07.987
Given this evidence,

28:08.020 --> 28:11.457
I will grant the petition
for Habeas Corpus.

28:11.490 --> 28:15.762
Mr. Thompson will be held
pending retrial.

28:15.795 --> 28:17.263
Wait, it worked?

28:17.296 --> 28:18.931
Daddy, it's
really happening.

28:18.965 --> 28:20.800
Come here.

28:23.102 --> 28:26.238
Retrial--why didn't he just
drop all the charges?

28:26.272 --> 28:27.874
One step at a time.

28:27.907 --> 28:29.075
(Will)
This trial
will be different, Dad.

28:29.108 --> 28:30.642
We'll be right there
with you.

28:30.676 --> 28:31.811
With the new evidence,
it's possible

28:31.844 --> 28:35.081
that the jury
will find reasonable doubt.

28:35.114 --> 28:37.784
Congratulations, Counselor,
and you too, Mr. Thompson.

28:37.784 --> 28:40.586
I'm sure you're eager
to move on with your life.

28:40.619 --> 28:42.354
What can
we do for you, Ken?

28:42.388 --> 28:46.092
How would your client feel about
skipping a retrial altogether?

28:46.125 --> 28:47.794
(Bayard)
What are you offering?

28:47.794 --> 28:49.796
Criminal sexual act
in the first degree.

28:49.796 --> 28:51.130
We agree
to time served.

28:51.163 --> 28:55.701
Just think about it.

28:55.802 --> 28:58.871
- What does that mean?
- The DA wants to save face.

28:58.905 --> 29:00.572
So?
He'll let you out of jail.

29:00.606 --> 29:02.108
Yeah, but I'd have
a felony on my record.

29:02.141 --> 29:04.510
And you'd stay
on the Sex Offender Registry.

29:04.543 --> 29:06.478
You'd have to admit
to your guilt in open court

29:06.512 --> 29:07.613
as part
of the plea deal.

29:07.646 --> 29:09.015
And I can't take
that back.

29:09.048 --> 29:10.983
Mr. Thompson, if you take
Mr. O'Dwyer's offer,

29:11.017 --> 29:12.284
you will spare
your daughter

29:12.318 --> 29:13.820
from being cross-examined
on the stand.

29:13.853 --> 29:15.487
He'd really take this
to trial again?

29:15.521 --> 29:17.456
He really believes
that you're guilty.

29:17.489 --> 29:19.391
It's easier than accepting
he put an innocent man

29:19.425 --> 29:20.626
in jail for 17 years.

29:20.659 --> 29:22.394
No, all this time,

29:22.428 --> 29:24.864
all I've had is the fact
that I'm innocent,

29:24.897 --> 29:26.398
and I would never hurt
my daughter,

29:26.432 --> 29:28.200
and he can't ask me
to say I did.

29:28.234 --> 29:31.203
He could keep you in prison
for the rest of your life.

29:31.237 --> 29:32.638
Daddy, please.

29:32.671 --> 29:34.306
No, it's the truth
that's supposed

29:34.340 --> 29:36.876
to set you free,
not a lie.

29:48.754 --> 29:52.058
- Counselor, good morning.
- Sergeant Benson, Mr. Ellis.

29:52.091 --> 29:53.860
Well, your defendant
wanted his day in court.

29:53.860 --> 29:55.494
- I hope he's ready for it.
- Oh, he is.

29:55.527 --> 29:57.063
He's been thinking about it
for 17 years.

29:57.096 --> 29:58.865
Well, it didn't have
to come to this.

29:58.898 --> 29:59.999
I offered him
a way out.

30:00.032 --> 30:01.667
When a man refuses
to plead guilty

30:01.700 --> 30:03.836
to get out of jail,
that should tell you something.

30:03.870 --> 30:05.938
It tells me he's
a pathological narcissist.

30:05.972 --> 30:08.074
If he really cared about
his children, his daughter,

30:08.107 --> 30:09.508
he wouldn't
put her through this.

30:09.541 --> 30:10.877
He's not worried
about her.

30:10.910 --> 30:12.544
He's worried
about his name, his ego.

30:12.578 --> 30:14.680
Ego--it's funny
you should mention that.

30:14.713 --> 30:16.515
- Bayard--
- No, no, no.

30:16.548 --> 30:18.784
Let Mr. Ellis speak his mind.
It's his favorite activity.

30:18.817 --> 30:20.552
No one likes
to admit to a mistake,

30:20.586 --> 30:23.055
but Derek Thompson suffered a
horrible miscarriage of justice,

30:23.089 --> 30:25.958
and we have the opportunity
to right a terrible wrong.

30:25.992 --> 30:27.059
We?

30:27.093 --> 30:28.694
It's not up to a DA,
a lawyer,

30:28.727 --> 30:30.963
or even a judge to determine
guilt or innocence.

30:30.997 --> 30:33.365
It's up to a jury.

30:33.399 --> 30:34.934
Good luck.

30:38.737 --> 30:41.874
My daughter was crying
when I came home.

30:41.908 --> 30:43.910
I asked her why.

30:43.943 --> 30:46.979
She said, "Daddy hurt me
with his pee pee."

30:47.013 --> 30:49.048
(O'Dwyer)
And what did you do then?

30:49.081 --> 30:51.383
That next morning,
after Derek left,

30:51.417 --> 30:52.885
I called the police,

30:52.919 --> 30:55.454
and we made sure
we got Michelle to a doctor.

30:55.487 --> 30:58.790
Can you tell me the name
of the investigating officer?

30:58.824 --> 31:00.459
Detective McCormack.

31:00.492 --> 31:03.562
And Detective McCormack
was someone you already knew?

31:03.595 --> 31:08.467
Yes, he had responded to several
domestic violence calls.

31:08.500 --> 31:10.302
Back then, Derek and I
used to really go at it,

31:10.336 --> 31:11.971
but what we did
to each other

31:12.004 --> 31:15.341
was nothing compared to what
he did to Michelle that night.

31:15.374 --> 31:19.011
Why'd you form a relationship
with Detective McCormack?

31:19.045 --> 31:21.813
I knew me and my children
needed protection.

31:21.847 --> 31:23.983
After that night,
the only thing on my mind

31:24.016 --> 31:27.153
was making sure
that my children were safe.

31:27.186 --> 31:30.957
Thank you, Ms. Jones.

31:30.957 --> 31:33.392
You were involved
with Detective McCormack.

31:33.425 --> 31:36.395
You spent the weekend with him
in Florida, which we know

31:36.428 --> 31:41.968
because you received a citation
for drunk and disorderly.

31:41.968 --> 31:44.236
Was that vacation

31:44.270 --> 31:47.706
before or after
your ex-husband's trial?

31:47.739 --> 31:50.876
Before, but that had nothing
to do with this case.

31:50.977 --> 31:53.012
If that's true, why didn't you
or Detective McCormack

31:53.045 --> 31:54.613
disclose your
relationship to the DA

31:54.646 --> 31:56.715
or your husband's
defense counsel?

31:56.748 --> 31:58.384
He was married.

31:58.417 --> 32:00.419
It was wrong, but we didn't want
his wife to find out.

32:00.452 --> 32:02.989
Or maybe you were afraid
that if the jury

32:03.022 --> 32:05.124
knew about
your relationship,

32:05.157 --> 32:06.993
they would've believe
either of you.

32:06.993 --> 32:09.095
- Objection.
- Withdrawn.

32:09.128 --> 32:11.297
The night you claim
your daughter was assaulted,

32:11.330 --> 32:14.166
what time
did you come home?

32:14.200 --> 32:16.002
I'm not sure.

32:16.002 --> 32:18.004
Had you been
drinking?

32:18.004 --> 32:19.538
Yes.

32:19.571 --> 32:21.207
I'm not proud
about that.

32:21.240 --> 32:23.875
It was late.
You'd been drinking.

32:23.909 --> 32:25.477
Did you get into a fight
with your husband?

32:25.511 --> 32:27.013
(Audrey)
Yes.

32:27.046 --> 32:29.281
And immediately after that,
your daughter

32:29.315 --> 32:32.284
supposedly disclosed to you that
her father had assaulted her?

32:32.318 --> 32:34.186
She was hurt.
She was--she was crying.

32:34.220 --> 32:36.188
Yet you didn't seek
medical attention for her

32:36.222 --> 32:37.623
or call the police
that night.

32:37.656 --> 32:39.691
I wanted to wait until
my husband was out of the house.

32:39.725 --> 32:41.193
The next morning,
when you knew

32:41.227 --> 32:43.662
Detective McCormack
would be on duty.

32:43.695 --> 32:47.233
I wanted to wait until
my husband was out of the house.

32:47.266 --> 32:49.235
Did Detective McCormack
suggest to you

32:49.268 --> 32:51.170
that if you wanted to get
your husband out of your life,

32:51.203 --> 32:53.039
accusing him
of sexual assault

32:53.039 --> 32:55.907
was a far more potent weapon
than a domestic violence charge?

32:55.941 --> 32:57.409
No. No.

32:57.443 --> 33:02.414
So you came up
with that idea on your own?

33:02.448 --> 33:05.917
(O'Dwyer)
Objection.

33:05.951 --> 33:07.453
Withdrawn.

33:13.125 --> 33:15.594
I wasn't
the best father.

33:15.627 --> 33:20.399
I didn't
make enough money.

33:20.432 --> 33:22.968
I worked long hours.
I couldn't always be there.

33:23.069 --> 33:25.471
- But you tried to be?
- Yeah.

33:25.504 --> 33:28.174
I did the best I could
to raise my children.

33:28.207 --> 33:30.276
My wife--she wasn't
interested in that,

33:30.309 --> 33:32.411
Not after she turned
to drugs and alcohol.

33:32.444 --> 33:34.813
Is that why you kept in touch
with your children from prison?

33:34.846 --> 33:36.482
Yes.

33:36.515 --> 33:40.652
They needed parenting, even
if it was just through letters.

33:40.686 --> 33:45.657
So once again,
on the night in question,

33:45.691 --> 33:48.427
did you sexually assault
your daughter Michelle?

33:48.460 --> 33:52.598
Absolutely not.

33:52.631 --> 33:54.400
Thank you,
Mr. Thompson.

33:58.904 --> 34:00.706
When the police
initially questioned you

34:00.739 --> 34:04.543
about your daughter's injuries,
the semen on her pajamas,

34:04.576 --> 34:06.345
did you accuse your wife
of planting it?

34:06.378 --> 34:09.915
I only said that
because the police lied to me.

34:09.948 --> 34:11.117
There was no semen.

34:11.117 --> 34:12.718
Why didn't
you just say that?

34:12.751 --> 34:16.188
Because I was trying
to make sense of it.

34:16.222 --> 34:19.358
(O'Dwyer)
Okay.

34:19.391 --> 34:24.363
Mr. Thompson, the only reason
that we're here

34:24.396 --> 34:25.697
is because your daughter

34:25.731 --> 34:29.568
is now recanting
her original statement.

34:29.601 --> 34:31.603
You testified to writing
her letters.

34:31.637 --> 34:34.273
In those letters,
did you ask her

34:34.306 --> 34:35.407
to help you get
out of prison?

34:35.441 --> 34:37.409
Yes, because--

34:37.443 --> 34:39.445
Do you think it's possible
that she's recanting now

34:39.478 --> 34:41.213
because you manipulated
her into it?

34:41.247 --> 34:42.914
I only asked her
to tell the truth.

34:42.948 --> 34:45.984
Hadn't she done that already
to DAs, to detectives,

34:46.017 --> 34:47.486
to the jury, under oath?

34:47.519 --> 34:50.156
My ex told her
to say those things.

34:50.156 --> 34:52.558
(O'Dwyer)
And now you're telling her
to say other things.

35:07.406 --> 35:07.539
.

35:08.774 --> 35:09.641
(Michelle)
When Detective McCormack
got there,

35:10.942 --> 35:12.544
my mother made me tell him
that I'd been raped,

35:12.578 --> 35:14.780
but that wasn't
the truth.

35:14.813 --> 35:16.648
(Bayard)
Then why did you
continue to say it

35:16.682 --> 35:18.617
even months later
at trial?

35:18.650 --> 35:21.052
I was six.
I was scared of my mother.

35:21.086 --> 35:23.189
I did
what she told me to do.

35:23.189 --> 35:25.291
I've regretted it every day
of my life.

35:25.324 --> 35:27.092
Thank you,
Ms. Thompson.

35:34.733 --> 35:38.204
You say your father
did not rape you,

35:38.204 --> 35:42.474
yet in your original testimony,
you claimed otherwise.

35:42.508 --> 35:47.979
Will you read this
for the jury?

35:48.013 --> 35:50.081
"Daddy hurt me.

35:50.115 --> 35:51.817
"He tucked me in,

35:51.850 --> 35:54.753
"and then he tried
to put his penis in my vagina.

35:54.786 --> 35:56.888
"It hurt a lot.

35:56.922 --> 36:00.326
Then he put
his finger inside me."

36:00.359 --> 36:02.594
Do you recall saying
those words?

36:02.628 --> 36:04.796
Yes.
I was forced to.

36:04.830 --> 36:06.465
In a recent interview
with SVU,

36:06.498 --> 36:10.001
you said you burned your hand
that night

36:10.035 --> 36:11.570
trying to cook
hot dogs.

36:11.603 --> 36:15.241
Yes, my dad blamed my mom
for leaving us alone.

36:15.241 --> 36:16.275
He got angry.

36:16.308 --> 36:18.143
Oh, do you
remember that?

36:18.244 --> 36:20.479
I remember
hearing them fight.

36:20.512 --> 36:23.915
Do you remember
which hand was burned?

36:23.949 --> 36:27.152
My right hand.
It hurt a lot.

36:27.253 --> 36:29.955
(O'Dwyer)
But when you went to visit
a doctor the next morning,

36:29.988 --> 36:32.858
she examined the bruises
on your thighs, yet made no note

36:32.891 --> 36:34.159
of a hand injury.

36:34.260 --> 36:35.927
Did you forget
to tell her?

36:35.961 --> 36:38.096
I was there because my mom
made me say I'd been raped.

36:38.129 --> 36:41.467
Is it possible that you never
burned your hand at all,

36:41.500 --> 36:45.871
but your father convinced you
that this happened?

36:45.904 --> 36:48.540
I don't think so.

36:48.574 --> 36:50.108
But it is possible

36:50.141 --> 36:53.479
that your mother convinced you
that you were raped,

36:53.512 --> 36:57.283
even though
you say that never happened?

37:03.389 --> 37:07.626
Or maybe it's just easier
to believe that your father

37:07.659 --> 37:09.295
didn't rape you.

37:09.295 --> 37:11.897
- Objection.
- Sustained.

37:14.466 --> 37:19.305
Did your father
hurt you that night?

37:19.305 --> 37:22.207
I know he didn't.

37:22.308 --> 37:25.744
You know he didn't
or do you remember he didn't?

37:29.315 --> 37:30.949
I don't remember him
doing anything.

37:30.982 --> 37:32.384
(O'Dwyer)
Which isn't the same

37:32.418 --> 37:36.087
as remembering
that he didn't do anything.

37:36.121 --> 37:38.590
Is this a story
you've been told to remember?

37:38.624 --> 37:40.191
What?

37:40.225 --> 37:42.227
(O'Dwyer)
I'm gonna ask you
one more time, Ms. Thompson,

37:42.328 --> 37:44.330
and I'm gonna remind you
that you're under oath.

37:44.363 --> 37:46.332
Did your father
rape you?

37:46.332 --> 37:49.335
[somber music]

37:49.335 --> 37:54.340
*

37:54.340 --> 37:57.208
Did your father
rape you?

37:57.242 --> 38:02.381
I don't know.
I was six.

38:02.414 --> 38:04.383
[crying]
I can't--

38:04.416 --> 38:06.352
Daddy, I'm so sorry.

38:22.067 --> 38:25.371
- Redirect, Your Honor.
- I'll allow it.

38:35.381 --> 38:37.383
Michelle, I know it took a lot
for you to come up here

38:37.383 --> 38:40.586
and testify today.

38:40.619 --> 38:43.188
Just now, did you feel
as if Mr. O'Dwyer

38:43.221 --> 38:46.592
was bullying you?

38:46.625 --> 38:50.195
- Yes.
- Did that confuse you?

38:50.228 --> 38:51.863
Did you give him
the answer

38:51.897 --> 38:57.002
that you thought he wanted
to hear so that he would stop?

38:57.035 --> 38:58.837
Yes.

38:58.870 --> 39:01.773
Similar to what happened
to you with your mother

39:01.807 --> 39:03.108
when you were six?

39:03.141 --> 39:05.010
That's right.

39:05.043 --> 39:10.315
(Bayard)
Did your father ever do that
to you before you recanted?

39:10.416 --> 39:12.618
No, not at all.

39:12.651 --> 39:14.486
In fact, after your father
was taken away,

39:14.520 --> 39:16.021
you tried
to tell the truth

39:16.054 --> 39:18.490
to your teacher,
to Detective McCormack,

39:18.524 --> 39:21.493
and to ADA O'Dwyer.

39:21.527 --> 39:24.630
Yes, but they
wouldn't listen.

39:24.663 --> 39:28.834
I'm listening,
Michelle.

39:28.867 --> 39:32.738
Did your father
rape you that night?

39:37.543 --> 39:41.547
No.
No, he didn't.

39:43.915 --> 39:45.717
Thank you.

40:07.606 --> 40:12.377
Michelle,
you all right?

40:12.410 --> 40:14.345
What happened
to me up there?

40:14.379 --> 40:15.881
O'Dwyer
kept going at you

40:15.914 --> 40:17.549
until you said
what he wanted you to say,

40:17.583 --> 40:19.551
but Mr. Ellis is gonna
make sure that the jury

40:19.585 --> 40:21.219
saw that
for what it was.

40:21.252 --> 40:23.221
If you say so.

40:23.254 --> 40:26.024
When I was up there,
I started wondering.

40:26.057 --> 40:30.829
Am I doing all this
for my father or for me?

40:30.862 --> 40:33.264
You have no idea what
it's like having everyone

40:33.298 --> 40:37.268
think that my father
did that to me.

40:37.302 --> 40:39.404
I used to say
he was dead.

40:39.437 --> 40:41.573
I just want that part
of my life to be over.

40:41.607 --> 40:43.174
It is.

40:43.208 --> 40:46.211
You made sure that the truth
was heard this time.

40:46.244 --> 40:48.213
Right, the truth.

40:48.246 --> 40:51.449
The truth is,
I don't really remember.

41:07.633 --> 41:09.601
(Judge Kearns)
Ladies and gentleman
of the jury,

41:09.635 --> 41:10.969
have you reached
a verdict?

41:11.002 --> 41:13.138
(woman)
We have, Your Honor.

41:13.171 --> 41:15.707
On the charge of rape
in the first degree,

41:15.741 --> 41:20.378
we find the defendant,
Derek Thompson,

41:20.411 --> 41:21.813
not guilty.

41:21.847 --> 41:23.882
Yes.

41:23.915 --> 41:26.384
(Judge Kearns)
The State of New York
thanks you for your service.

41:26.417 --> 41:29.020
Derek Thompson,
if there are no holds,

41:29.054 --> 41:30.556
you are free to go.

41:38.730 --> 41:41.700

41:50.576 --> 41:51.910
Thank you, Olivia.

41:51.943 --> 41:53.912
We did
the right thing.

42:01.887 --> 42:04.122
Did we?
