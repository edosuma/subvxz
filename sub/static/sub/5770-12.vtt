00:01.871 --> 00:03.699
[Jeremy]
MINDY, I HAD THE MOST AMAZING
ENCOUNTER LAST NIGHT.

00:03.742 --> 00:05.396
I MET A WOMAN
AT THE MERCH TABLE

00:05.440 --> 00:06.876
OF A PERFORMANCE
OF THE LION KING.

00:06.919 --> 00:10.619
LET'S JUST SAY
SHE FELT THE LOVE LAST NIGHT.

00:10.662 --> 00:12.055
MINDY, DID A--

00:12.099 --> 00:14.275
OH, MY GOD!OH, GOD, JEREMY,
I'M SO SORRY.

00:14.318 --> 00:15.841
WOW. JEREMY, I'M SO SORRY.
I'M SO SORRY.

00:15.885 --> 00:17.321
I FORGOT I WAS WEARING THIS.

00:17.365 --> 00:19.062
I SPEND
SO MANY NIGHTS HERE NOW,

00:19.106 --> 00:20.194
AND I'M SCARED
OF GETTING MURDERED.

00:20.237 --> 00:21.238
SO I FIGURE,
IF I'M WEARING THIS,

00:21.282 --> 00:22.761
MURDERERS WILL THINK
I'M A MURDERER

00:22.805 --> 00:24.111
AND THEY'LL JUST GO,
"EH,

00:24.154 --> 00:25.329
TOO MANY COOKS
IN THE KITCHEN."

00:25.373 --> 00:26.939
YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE HERE CONSTANTLY.

00:26.983 --> 00:28.767
WELL, MY PLAN
WAS TO MARRY RICH

00:28.811 --> 00:30.334
AND THEN STOP WORKING,
OR TO MARRY OLD,

00:30.378 --> 00:32.380
AND THEN WHEN THE GUY DIED,
INHERIT ALL HIS MONEY.

00:32.423 --> 00:34.338
BUT OLD GUYS THINK
I HAVE SASS MOUTH.

00:34.382 --> 00:36.253
NO, YOU'RE GOING ABOUT IT
ALL WRONG, MINDY.

00:36.297 --> 00:38.168
I MEAN, YEAH, IT'S HARD
TO MIX WORK AND LOVE.

00:38.212 --> 00:40.562
BUT IT'S NOT HARD
TO MIX WORK AND SEX.

00:40.605 --> 00:42.912
I LIKE SEX.
TELL ME MORE.

00:42.955 --> 00:45.001
WELL, I HAD AN HOUR
BETWEEN DELIVERIES,

00:45.045 --> 00:47.395
AND I MET THIS VERY NUBILE
RUSSIAN BALLERINA

00:47.438 --> 00:49.092
AT AN INTERNET CAFE.

00:49.136 --> 00:51.225
HEY, MAN,
DON'T TELL ME SEX STORIES.

00:51.268 --> 00:52.400
OH.I MEAN, TELL ME MORE
ABOUT--YEAH.

00:52.443 --> 00:53.662
COME ON.ALL I'M SAYING IS,

00:53.705 --> 00:55.359
MAYBE YOU SHOULD CONSIDER
A MORE,

00:55.403 --> 00:57.100
I DON'T KNOW,
CASUAL ARRANGEMENT.

00:57.144 --> 00:58.449
I DON'T KNOW.
REMEMBER, WE TRIED THAT,

00:58.493 --> 00:59.885
AND IT KINDA SUCKED.THAT WASN'T CASUAL FOR YOU.

00:59.929 --> 01:02.323
YOU LOVED ME.OKAY. I DON'T KNOW
THAT I LOVED YOU--

01:02.366 --> 01:03.628
YOU WERE DEEPLY
AND FULLY IN LOVE WITH ME.

01:03.672 --> 01:05.630
I AGAIN--I THINK THAT--NO, IT'S OKAY.

01:05.674 --> 01:07.284
ALL I'M SAYING IS,
IF YOU WANT

01:07.328 --> 01:08.720
TO START ENJOYING LIFE,
SKIP THE DATE,

01:08.764 --> 01:10.244
MOVE ON TO THE GOOD PART.

01:12.768 --> 01:14.900
[screams]OW!

01:14.944 --> 01:16.815
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
WHY ARE YOU WEARING THAT?

01:16.859 --> 01:18.121
'CAUSE I DON'T WANT
TO GET MURDERED, DANNY!

01:18.165 --> 01:20.123
THAT DOESN'T CLARIFY
ANYTHING!

01:20.167 --> 01:23.126
[upbeat music]

01:23.170 --> 01:31.178
â™ª

01:34.964 --> 01:36.879
HEY, DANNY.
CAN YOU TRADE MOUSES WITH ME?

01:36.922 --> 01:38.402
MINE'S ALL OILY.

01:38.446 --> 01:40.274
WAIT,
WHY ARE THE MIDWIVES HERE?

01:40.317 --> 01:42.450
BECAUSE THIS MORNING
WHEN I CAME TO WORK

01:42.493 --> 01:44.365
I WAS GREETED BY WATER
COMING FROM MY CEILING,

01:44.408 --> 01:48.282
BECAUSE THEIR STUPID WATER BIRTH
TUB EXPLODED OVER THE WEEKEND.

01:48.325 --> 01:50.284
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS JOKER DOES?

01:50.327 --> 01:54.157
HE GIVES ME THIS HEALING ANGER
BOOK BY SOME NEW-AGE WEIRDO.

01:54.201 --> 01:57.291
I SUPPOSE SOME WOULD CALL
THE DALAI LAMA A NEW AGE WEIRDO.

01:57.334 --> 01:59.467
CHINESE COMMUNISTS, MAYBE.

01:59.510 --> 02:01.643
HI, MINDY.DON'T "HI" ME, DESLAURIER.

02:01.686 --> 02:03.253
YEAH, DON'T "HI" HER.

02:03.297 --> 02:04.602
YOU MIGHT TRICK
SOME OF OUR PATIENTS

02:04.646 --> 02:06.561
TO DEFECT TO YOUR
SHAM MIDWIFE OPERATION

02:06.604 --> 02:08.040
THAT YOU HAVE GOING ON,
BUT YOU CAN'T TRICK US

02:08.084 --> 02:09.216
INTO SAYING HI TO YOU.HI.

02:09.259 --> 02:12.001
HI. DAMN IT.WHAT DO YOU SAY, DUNCAN?

02:12.044 --> 02:14.308
SHALL WE TAKE OUR OOLONG
AND SAY SO LONG?

02:14.351 --> 02:16.179
[Dr. Castellano]
THAT'S LAME.GOT YOUR--

02:16.223 --> 02:18.790
OH, HEY, NO ONE TOLD ME
ABOUT THE COOL CONVENTION.

02:18.834 --> 02:20.270
HI, DUNCAN.HEY, MORGAN.

02:20.314 --> 02:23.143
DON'T TALK TO HIM.
THEY'RE NOT OUR FRIENDS, MORGAN.

02:23.186 --> 02:24.666
I GOTTA CHECK SOMETHING
IN MY FILE.

02:24.709 --> 02:26.276
[whispers]
HI, DUNCAN.

02:32.239 --> 02:34.458
PSST.
SHAUNA.

02:34.502 --> 02:37.200
HMM?
I KNOW THAT YOU'RE
WITH OFFICER STASSEN RIGHT NOW,

02:37.244 --> 02:39.811
BUT BEFORE THAT,
DID YOU EVER ENGAGE

02:39.855 --> 02:41.944
IN ANYTHING KIND OF,
LIKE, CASUAL?

02:41.987 --> 02:43.467
PEOPLE SEEM TO BE HAVING
THESE AWESOME SEX LIVES,

02:43.511 --> 02:45.469
AND I'M JUST TRYING TO, LIKE,
FIND A LIFE PARTNER

02:45.513 --> 02:47.732
TO GO APPLE-PICKING WITH.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?

02:47.776 --> 02:49.473
DR. L, ARE YOU THINKING
ABOUT HAVING A ONE-NIGHT STAND?

02:49.517 --> 02:51.301
'CAUSE, TAKE IT FROM ME,
THEY ARE THE PITS.

02:51.345 --> 02:52.607
THAT'S OKAY, MORGAN.

02:52.650 --> 02:54.130
I WASN'T REALLY OPENING IT UP
TO THE FLOOR,

02:54.174 --> 02:55.697
SO YOU CAN JUST--NO, NO, I'M INVESTED NOW.

02:55.740 --> 02:57.394
OKAY.
LISTEN TO ME.

02:57.438 --> 02:58.352
YOU ARE TOO PURE
TO BE HAVING

02:58.395 --> 03:00.223
A BUNCH OF GROSS SEX
WITH RANDOS.

03:00.267 --> 03:01.398
I WAS NEVER--

03:01.442 --> 03:02.573
YOU ARE LIKE
A LITTLE BABY DEER, YOU KNOW?

03:02.617 --> 03:04.227
YOU GOT LITTLE WHITE SPOTS
ON YOU,

03:04.271 --> 03:06.273
AND YOU'RE EATING
A BOTTLE OF MILK,

03:06.316 --> 03:08.971
AND YOU GOT TO WAIT
FOR YOUR TEN-POINT BUCK.

03:09.014 --> 03:10.538
AND THEN THE TWO OF YOU
GET MARRIED

03:10.581 --> 03:12.366
UNDER, LIKE,
A CANOPY IN THE FOREST,

03:12.409 --> 03:13.541
AND THE RABBITS ARE THERE,

03:13.584 --> 03:16.108
AND THERE'S, LIKE, A OWL
WHO'S THE PRIEST.

03:16.152 --> 03:17.588
AND I REALLY WANT THAT.

03:17.632 --> 03:20.025
JUST GETTING KIND OF IMPATIENT,
YOU KNOW.

03:20.069 --> 03:21.288
I WANT TO HAVE FUN.

03:21.331 --> 03:22.637
DON'T FEEL BAD, DR. L.

03:22.680 --> 03:24.987
WE'RE IN THE NO ONE-NIGHT STAND
CLUB TOGETHER.

03:25.030 --> 03:27.119
MAYBE SATURDAY NIGHT
YOU AND I COULD MEET UP

03:27.163 --> 03:29.905
AND MAKE OUR LUNCHES
FOR THE WEEK.

03:29.948 --> 03:30.949
OH, GOD.

03:31.950 --> 03:33.691
HEY.HI.

03:33.735 --> 03:35.606
CAN I ASK YOU SOME ADVICE?

03:35.650 --> 03:39.088
ABOUT THAT THING THAT WE WERE
TALKING ABOUT EARLIER.

03:39.131 --> 03:40.263
YES.
LASER HAIR REMOVAL

03:40.307 --> 03:41.656
CAN BE EXPENSIVE,
BUT THEN YOU WON'T HAVE

03:41.699 --> 03:43.397
THE SHADOW AT LEAST,
WHICH WILL HELP.

03:43.440 --> 03:44.920
NO, I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT THAT.

03:44.963 --> 03:46.443
OH, SORRY.

03:46.487 --> 03:49.968
I'M TALKING ABOUT HOW TO HELP
PICK A GUY FOR STUFF.

03:50.012 --> 03:51.840
OH. WELL, THE KEY, MINDY,
IS TO FIND A MAN

03:51.883 --> 03:53.276
WHO YOU'RE ATTRACTED TO... OKAY.

03:53.320 --> 03:55.583
BUT YOU DON'T RESPECT
AND YOU CAN'T SEE A FUTURE WITH.

03:55.626 --> 03:57.802
DRACO MALFOY.

03:57.846 --> 04:01.197
SOMEONE NOT FICTITIOUS.

04:01.241 --> 04:05.288
[Muzak playing]

04:05.332 --> 04:06.289
DOCTOR.

04:06.333 --> 04:07.856
UGH.

04:07.899 --> 04:10.641
LET'S EXAMINE
THAT "UGH" FOR A MOMENT.

04:10.685 --> 04:12.904
IT'S ACTUALLY
A VERY FASCINATING EMOTION.

04:12.948 --> 04:15.037
IT FINDS ITS ROOTS
IN AN EVOLUTIONARY FEAR

04:15.080 --> 04:16.125
OF CONTAMINATION.

04:16.168 --> 04:17.387
IT HAS VERY LITTLE
TO DO WITH DISGUST.

04:17.431 --> 04:18.475
OKAY, I GET IT, BRENDAN.

04:18.519 --> 04:19.346
YOU KNOW A LOT
ABOUT SCIENCE FACTS.

04:19.389 --> 04:21.435
CHOOSE TO IGNORE
IF YOU LIKE.

04:28.355 --> 04:32.141
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

04:32.184 --> 04:35.362
BRENDAN, UM...

04:35.405 --> 04:37.538
WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED

04:37.581 --> 04:42.325
IN, UM, ME COMING OVER...

04:42.369 --> 04:44.327
TO YOUR HOUSE...

04:44.371 --> 04:46.416
TOMORROW NIGHT...

04:46.460 --> 04:48.331
TO HANG OUT?

04:48.375 --> 04:50.290
I AM SO SORRY.

04:50.333 --> 04:51.334
YEAH, OKAY.I TAKE IT BACK.

04:51.378 --> 04:52.770
WAIT, WHAT?THAT SOUNDS FUN.

04:52.814 --> 04:55.295
LET'S DO IT.JUST TO BE 100% CLEAR,

04:55.338 --> 04:56.905
WHEN I SAY "HANG OUT,"

04:56.948 --> 04:59.777
I MEAN, LIKE--DO YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT?

04:59.821 --> 05:02.258
YEAH, I GET IT.WHOA.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.086
WE'RE GONNA HANG OUT.

05:04.129 --> 05:06.436
[bell dings]

05:09.352 --> 05:10.658
[Mindy]
GUYS, I AM SO NERVOUS

05:10.701 --> 05:11.833
ABOUT SEEING BRENDAN TONIGHT.

05:11.876 --> 05:13.965
OKAY, I LOVE YOU
HAVING RANDOM HOOK-UPS.

05:14.009 --> 05:15.445
I DON'T KNOW.
THE LAST TIME

05:15.489 --> 05:16.577
SHE TRIED THIS
WAS IN COLLEGE,

05:16.620 --> 05:17.926
AND SHE GOT SO FREAKED OUT

05:17.969 --> 05:19.536
THAT SHE PULLED THE FIRE ALARM
AT THE HILLEL HOUSE.

05:19.580 --> 05:21.973
GWEN, FIRST OF ALL,
AVI AND I WERE SITTING,

05:22.017 --> 05:23.540
LOOKING AT CDs
IN HIS CD BINDER.

05:23.584 --> 05:25.368
ALL OF A SUDDEN, HE STARTS
MASSAGING MY SHOULDERS.

05:25.412 --> 05:26.891
I FREAKED OUT.IF I CAN GIVE YOU

05:26.935 --> 05:27.892
ONE PIECE OF ADVICE?YEAH.

05:27.936 --> 05:29.285
DON'T WEAR UNDERWEAR.

05:29.329 --> 05:30.721
OKAY, I HAVE NEVER
NOT WORN UNDERWEAR.

05:30.765 --> 05:31.983
I WEAR UNDERWEAR
UNDER MY BATHING SUITS.

05:32.027 --> 05:33.724
OH, AND THIS
WILL DRIVE HIM CRAZY.

05:33.768 --> 05:34.986
UNDRESS HIM.

05:35.030 --> 05:36.118
LIKE I'M HIS MOM?

05:36.161 --> 05:37.598
CAN'T HE UNDRESS HIMSELF?

05:37.641 --> 05:38.773
NO, LIKE HE'S
A CHRISTMAS PRESENT

05:38.816 --> 05:40.078
THAT YOU JUST
CAN'T WAIT TO UNWRAP.

05:40.122 --> 05:41.123
OKAY, I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M AGREEING WITH THIS,

05:41.166 --> 05:42.516
BUT IT IS SO TRUE,
BECAUSE EVERY TIME

05:42.559 --> 05:43.821
I START TO UNBUTTON
CARL'S SHIRT,

05:43.865 --> 05:45.693
THAT CIVIL WAR BOOK
GETS CLOSED.

05:45.736 --> 05:47.390
ALL RIGHT,
I CAN UNDRESS THIS GUY.

05:47.434 --> 05:49.349
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHY HAVE WE
STOPPED DOING CRUNCHES,

05:49.392 --> 05:51.742
YOU MAGGOTS?HEY, WHY IS YOUR NURSE
RUNNING OUR BOOT CAMP?

05:51.786 --> 05:53.309
'CAUSE HE'S DIRT CHEAP.

05:53.353 --> 05:54.615
HEY, LESS QUESTIONS, MORE
CRUNCHES WITH YOUR FAT ASSES.

05:54.658 --> 05:56.921
WHAT'D YOU SAY?

06:00.360 --> 06:01.622
HI, I'M LOOKING
FOR DANNY.

06:01.665 --> 06:04.668
IS HE AROUND?OH, MY GOD.

06:04.712 --> 06:07.671
ARE YOU EYE PATCH?

06:07.715 --> 06:11.283
[laughs]
I'M JILLIAN, BUT, YEAH,
I'M WEARING AN EYE PATCH.

06:11.327 --> 06:12.589
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.HI, NICE TO MEET YOU.

06:12.633 --> 06:14.025
I'M MINDY.

06:14.069 --> 06:16.114
CAN I JUST SAY, EVEN THOUGH
YOU ONLY HAVE ONE EYE,

06:16.158 --> 06:17.638
YOU ARE SO PRETTY.

06:17.681 --> 06:19.248
I ACTUALLY HAVE TWO EYES.

06:19.291 --> 06:21.859
THIS ONE'S JUST INJURED
TEMPORARILY, BUT IT'LL BE BACK.

06:21.903 --> 06:23.774
HEY, CAN YOU PLEASE TELL ME
WHAT DANNY'S APARTMENT IS LIKE?

06:23.818 --> 06:26.298
IN MY MIND,
IT'S LIKE A SMOKY SPEAKEASY

06:26.342 --> 06:28.126
WHERE OLD MEN GO
TO COMPLAIN ABOUT TECHNOLOGY.

06:28.170 --> 06:30.041
BUT I COULD ALSO
SEE IT BEING--

06:30.085 --> 06:31.739
HEY, I TOLD YOU
TO GO RIGHT INTO MY OFFICE

06:31.782 --> 06:33.436
SO YOU DIDN'T HAVE
TO STOP IN THIS OUTER AREA.

06:33.480 --> 06:34.916
OH, NO,
COME ON.

06:34.959 --> 06:37.266
YEAH, BUT THEN WE WOULDN'T
BE ABLE TO INTERACT WITH HER.

06:37.309 --> 06:38.615
HI, I'M MORGAN TOOKERS.

06:38.659 --> 06:40.443
CAN I GET A QUICK PHOTO
WITH YOU?

06:40.487 --> 06:42.793
MORGAN, I DON'T WANT TO HAVE
THIS TALK AGAIN, OKAY?

06:42.837 --> 06:45.143
DANNY, YOUR GIRLFRIEND
IS SO PRETTY.

06:45.187 --> 06:46.841
AND SHE'S MUCH YOUNGER
THAN YOU.

06:46.884 --> 06:48.451
SHE'S NOT THAT MUCH YOUNGER.

06:48.495 --> 06:50.105
SHE LOOKS LIKE
SHE COULD BE MY DAUGHTER,

06:50.148 --> 06:52.934
AND I LOOK LIKE
I COULD BE YOUR DAUGHTER.

06:52.977 --> 06:54.109
WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS TONIGHT?

06:54.152 --> 06:55.415
WE'RE HEADING OUT OF HERE.

06:55.458 --> 06:57.329
WE'RE GONNA GO SEE A PLAY.

06:57.373 --> 06:59.027
WELL, IT'S MY FRIEND'S
CABARET SHOW.

06:59.070 --> 07:00.811
WHAT THEY DO IS THEY TAKE
THESE CLASSIC EPISODES

07:00.855 --> 07:03.814
OF GOLDEN GIRLS,AND THEY RECAST
ALL OF THE ROLES WITH GUYS.

07:03.858 --> 07:05.163
WHAT?IT'S VERY SEXUAL.

07:05.207 --> 07:07.165
THERE'S A HIGH, HIGH CHANCE
OF NUDITY.

07:07.209 --> 07:08.428
I MEAN, AREN'T WE GONNA SEE
A NORMAL PLAY,

07:08.471 --> 07:11.256
LIKE OUR TOWN
OR DEATH OF A SALESMAN?

07:11.300 --> 07:12.997
BACK IN OTISVILLE,
I WAS IN A PRODUCTION

07:13.041 --> 07:14.042
OF DEATH OF A SALESMAN.

07:14.085 --> 07:15.217
I PLAYED MOM.

07:15.260 --> 07:17.262
IRONICALLY,
THE GUY WHO PLAYED HAPPY

07:17.306 --> 07:20.918
HUNG HIMSELF IN HIS CELL.

07:20.962 --> 07:22.833
DID I USE IRONICALLY
CORRECTLY?

07:22.877 --> 07:24.052
OKAY, WE'RE GONNA HEAD OUT
TO DINNER,

07:24.095 --> 07:25.445
SO THANKS, GUYS.DINNER.

07:25.488 --> 07:27.011
IT'S LIKE 7:00.
WE'RE GONNA EAT AFTER.

07:27.055 --> 07:28.796
I MADE A RESERVATION
FOR SUSHI AT 11:00.

07:28.839 --> 07:30.972
11:00 AT NIGHT?
WOW, OKAY.

07:31.015 --> 07:32.930
WHEN ARE WE GONNA GO TO BED?

16:12.754 --> 16:14.321
THERE IS A STRONG LINK
BETWEEN PANIC

16:14.364 --> 16:15.539
AND ASTHMA, OKAY?

16:15.583 --> 16:17.019
YOU CAN'T JUST WAVE
A DREAM CATCHER

16:17.063 --> 16:18.716

BRENDAN.

16:18.760 --> 16:20.544

SINCE THE DAWN OF TIME.

16:59.105 --> 17:00.236
PRE-DAWN OF TIME.

17:00.280 --> 17:01.498
THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS PRE-DAWN OF TIME.

17:01.542 --> 17:02.978
THE NIGHT
BEFORE THE DAWN OF TIME.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.197
THE BEGINNING IS THE BEGINNING.
THERE'S NO BEFORE.

17:04.240 --> 17:05.589
JUST PLEASE STOP IT,

17:07.461 --> 17:09.332
AND YOU'RE STARTING

17:09.376 --> 17:11.291
HUGGED BY ROCKS.

17:11.334 --> 17:12.466
I FEEL SAFE.

17:12.509 --> 17:14.076
OKAY, NOW GIVE ME

17:19.777 --> 17:21.083
GIVE ME A STONE.HOW WAS I SUPPOSED
TO GLEAN THAT?

17:21.127 --> 17:23.085
WE'RE GONNA PLACE
THE STONE IN YOUR HAND

17:23.129 --> 17:24.956
AND SAY, "I'LL ALWAYS HAVE
THE QUARRY WITH ME."

17:25.000 --> 17:26.088
I'LL ALWAYS HAVE
THE QUARRY WITH ME.

17:26.132 --> 17:28.569
SO I CAN BREATHE.BREATHE...

17:47.109 --> 17:48.371
YOU CAN GO TO THE HOSPITAL.
IT'S COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY.

18:11.351 --> 18:12.743
I DIDN'T EVEN GET
TO GO.

18:12.787 --> 18:14.136
DR. L, THESE TWO COOL GUYS

18:14.180 --> 18:16.225
SPENT THE NIGHT TOGETHER,
JUST LIKE WE DID.

18:16.269 --> 18:18.053
MINDY, WAS YOUR TRYST
WITH MORGAN?

18:18.097 --> 18:19.315
WHAT?
NO.

18:19.359 --> 18:21.274
GUYS, I TRIED TO HAVE
A HOOK-UP TONIGHT,

18:21.317 --> 18:22.362
AND IT WENT HORRIBLY.

18:22.405 --> 18:24.103
MAYBE IT'LL BE BETTER
NEXT TIME.

18:24.146 --> 18:26.322
I DON'T THINK SO.
I TRIED FOR A GUY

18:26.366 --> 18:27.889
THAT I DON'T RESPECT.
GUESS WHAT, GUYS.

18:27.932 --> 18:29.760
NO SEX,
AND NOW I RESPECT HIM.

18:29.804 --> 18:31.414
SEE, I TOLD YOU
YOU GOT ATTACHED.

18:31.458 --> 18:32.676
YES, DANNY,
YOU WERE RIGHT.

18:32.720 --> 18:34.852
MY ONLY CONSOLATION
IS THAT YOU ARE HERE.

18:34.896 --> 18:37.246
SO IT MEANS THAT YOUR EVENING
WENT AS BADLY AS MINE.

18:37.290 --> 18:38.465
HEY.

18:38.508 --> 18:40.858
HEY.DAMN IT.

18:40.902 --> 18:43.122

18:43.165 --> 18:45.124
THANK YOU.

18:45.167 --> 18:46.777
OUT OF CURIOSITY,
DO THE FOUR OF YOU KNOW

18:46.821 --> 18:48.475
HOW TERRIBLE IT SMELLS
IN THIS DOCTORS' LOUNGE,

18:48.518 --> 18:49.650
OR ARE YOU USED TO IT?

18:49.693 --> 18:50.651
WE'RE USED TO IT.USED TO IT.

18:50.694 --> 18:51.652
I DON'T THINK
IT SMELLS BAD.

DR. JEREMY REED.

18:52.914 --> 18:54.176
PLEASURE TO MEET YOU,
MISS PATCH.

18:54.220 --> 18:55.960
YOU KNOW, YOUR EYE PATCH
GETS ALL THE ATTENTION,

18:56.004 --> 18:57.527
BUT I THINK YOUR NOSE
IS RATHER NOTEWORTHY.

18:57.571 --> 18:59.790
SHOULD YOU AND DANNY
FIND YOUR DIFFERENCES--

18:59.834 --> 19:01.401
OKAY, BUDDY,

19:03.881 --> 19:07.189
SO, I DON'T KNOW,
I JUST HAVE THIS FEELING

19:07.233 --> 19:09.191
LIKE MAYBE YOU LEFT
AND CAME HERE

19:09.235 --> 19:11.367
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T REALLY LIKE
OUR PLANS TONIGHT.

19:11.411 --> 19:13.630
I'M SORRY.
I JUST THINK

19:13.674 --> 19:16.720
WE'RE INTO DIFFERENT
THINGS, AND...

19:16.764 --> 19:18.244
AM I TOO OLD FOR YOU?

19:18.287 --> 19:20.202
I DON'T THINK SO.
I LIKE THAT YOU'RE 32.

19:20.246 --> 19:22.378
38.ARE YOU SERIOUS, DUDE?

19:22.422 --> 19:24.250
YEAH.

19:26.643 --> 19:28.079
WHAT?

19:28.123 --> 19:29.255
I'M JUST TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT

19:29.298 --> 19:31.909
HOW MANY OLYMPICS
YOU'VE BEEN AROUND FOR.

19:31.953 --> 19:34.085
WERE YOU ALIVE FOR BERLIN?

19:34.129 --> 19:36.697
IN 1936?

19:42.659 --> 19:44.008
[screams]

19:44.052 --> 19:45.227

19:53.583 --> 19:56.847
[romantic elevator music]

19:56.891 --> 19:59.372

20:01.591 --> 20:04.899
OKAY,
THIS IS MASSIVELY AWKWARD,

20:04.942 --> 20:07.249
SO I AM JUST GOING
TO START SAYING THINGS.

20:07.293 --> 20:09.425
BRENDAN,
I WAS NOT ABLE TO HAVE

20:09.469 --> 20:12.733
A CASUAL HOOK-UP WITH YOU.
THAT'S FINE.

20:12.776 --> 20:15.301
IN OTHER COUNTRIES,
THAT IS NOT EMBARRASSING.

20:15.344 --> 20:16.302
IT IS ACTUALLY A VIRTUE.

20:16.345 --> 20:18.173
MAYBE NOT FOR YOU

20:18.217 --> 20:20.131
AND WHATEVER WEIRD COMMUNE
THAT YOU WERE RAISED IN,

20:20.175 --> 20:22.090
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE
THAT INTERNATIONALLY

20:22.133 --> 20:23.091
I HAVE THE UPPER HAND.

20:23.134 --> 20:25.180
IT IS RUDE
TO NOT HAVE SNACKS

20:25.224 --> 20:26.921
AT YOUR HOUSE
WHEN SOMEONE'S COMING OVER.

20:26.964 --> 20:29.140
ALL RIGHT?
PRETZELS, CHIPS, SOME SODA--

20:29.184 --> 20:30.577
HOW HARD IS THAT?

20:30.620 --> 20:32.274
AND YOUR GUITAR PLAYING,
WHILE TECHNICALLY PROFICIENT,

20:32.318 --> 20:34.929
LACKS DEPTH.

20:34.972 --> 20:37.888
THERE IS A SMALL KNIFE
AT YOUR HOUSE.

20:37.932 --> 20:39.934
I BROUGHT IT WITH ME

20:39.977 --> 20:42.023
TO STAB YOU WITH IT
IN CASE YOU TRIED TO ATTACK ME.

20:42.066 --> 20:44.330
IT IS HIDDEN DISCREETLY
IN A WOMAN'S GLOVE.

20:44.373 --> 20:47.246
I WOULD HATE FOR DUNCAN
TO HURT HIMSELF.

20:47.289 --> 20:48.812
I DID NOT HOWEVER THANK YOU

20:48.856 --> 20:51.206
FOR HELPING MY FRIEND.
SO THANK YOU.

21:06.526 --> 21:10.007

IN AN ELEVATOR.

21:10.051 --> 21:12.880
YEAH, OF COURSE.

21:12.923 --> 21:14.229
