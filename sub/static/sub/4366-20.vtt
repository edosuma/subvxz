WEBVTT

00:02.695 --> 00:05.924
You are being watched.

00:05.926 --> 00:07.793
The government
has a secret system--

00:07.795 --> 00:12.328
A machine that spies on you
every hour of every day.

00:12.330 --> 00:13.894
I know because I built it.

00:13.896 --> 00:16.630
I designed the machine
to detect acts of terror,

00:16.632 --> 00:18.465
but it sees everything...

00:18.467 --> 00:21.242
Violent crimes
involving ordinary people,

00:21.244 --> 00:22.676
people like you,

00:22.678 --> 00:26.614
crimes the government
considered irrelevant.

00:26.616 --> 00:29.286
They wouldn't act,
so I decided I would.

00:29.288 --> 00:30.887
But I needed a partner--

00:30.889 --> 00:35.092
Someone with the skills
to intervene.

00:35.094 --> 00:38.833
Hunted by the authorities,
we work in secret.

00:38.835 --> 00:40.801
You will never find us.

00:40.803 --> 00:42.136
But victim or perpetrator,

00:42.138 --> 00:45.673
if your number's up,
we'll find you.

01:00.490 --> 01:02.125
Tell me where he is.

01:02.127 --> 01:03.760
We could do this all night.

01:03.762 --> 01:05.898
Look at me.

01:05.900 --> 01:07.333
Sooner or later,

01:07.335 --> 01:10.438
you're gonna start
talking to me.

01:10.440 --> 01:12.941
Let's try
some nonverbal communication.

01:12.943 --> 01:16.110
Aah!

01:36.201 --> 01:39.035
It's me.
Jessica, I mean.

01:39.037 --> 01:41.739
I don't even know if
you check this number.

01:41.741 --> 01:45.745
Um, I need to talk.

01:56.026 --> 01:59.462
Jessica, I got your message.

01:59.464 --> 02:03.835
I didn't know
if you'd call me back.

02:03.837 --> 02:06.505
We haven't talked in--
What, four years?

02:06.507 --> 02:07.973
What's wrong?

02:07.975 --> 02:10.911
Is everything okay with Peter?

02:10.913 --> 02:13.814
Yeah, he's fine.
We're both fine.

02:13.816 --> 02:15.384
I just...

02:15.386 --> 02:18.053
Needed a friend
that I could talk to.

02:18.055 --> 02:21.525
Something's wrong.
Talk to me.

02:21.527 --> 02:23.627
You know, you were right.

02:23.629 --> 02:27.365
In the airport,
the last time I saw you.

02:27.367 --> 02:32.138
You said that, in the end,
we were all alone.

02:32.140 --> 02:35.108
I should go.

02:35.110 --> 02:36.075
Jess.

02:36.077 --> 02:39.213
Bye, John.

02:39.215 --> 02:43.984
I'm coming to get you.
I'll be there in 24 hours.

02:43.986 --> 02:48.088
Wait for me.

02:48.090 --> 02:52.326
I'll wait.

02:56.764 --> 02:59.466
It all comes down
to a matter of trust,

02:59.468 --> 03:03.203
the foundation
of any healthy relationship.

03:03.205 --> 03:06.174
I just need to know
where this is headed.

03:06.176 --> 03:07.842
Trust is
a two-way street, Carter.

03:07.844 --> 03:08.977
I know.

03:08.979 --> 03:11.613
I do trust you
and your friend--

03:11.615 --> 03:13.816
The two people
I know the least.

03:13.818 --> 03:16.452
It's the job
I'm not sure about anymore.

03:16.454 --> 03:18.421
I don't know who's
got my back on the force.

03:18.423 --> 03:21.324
I'm pretty sure the guy across
the desk from me is dirty.

03:21.326 --> 03:25.462
Well, I'll keep my eye on him.

03:25.464 --> 03:28.466
I need to know more, John.

03:28.468 --> 03:31.135
I need to know just as much
as you and your friend do

03:31.137 --> 03:34.939
about these cases
we're working.

03:34.941 --> 03:38.209
Okay, let's work
this one together.

03:46.919 --> 03:50.021
This guy over here
with his girl?

03:50.023 --> 03:53.291
Yeah, only that's not his girl.

03:59.332 --> 04:02.768
That's his girl.

04:04.672 --> 04:08.241
You worthless, lying dirtbag!

04:11.614 --> 04:13.648
You're under arrest.

04:13.650 --> 04:16.250
I thought you said we were
working this one together.

04:16.252 --> 04:17.851
We are.

04:17.853 --> 04:19.253
You're taking care
of the shooter,

04:19.255 --> 04:20.988
and I'm making sure
the cheating boyfriend

04:20.990 --> 04:22.590
doesn't get hurt.

04:22.592 --> 04:25.092
Looks fine to me.

04:25.094 --> 04:27.628
Mr. Reese, a new number
has come in.

04:27.630 --> 04:28.596
Have you and Detective Carter

04:28.598 --> 04:30.698
wrapped things up
on the last one?

04:30.700 --> 04:33.233
Just about.

04:33.235 --> 04:35.802
You still haven't said
why you brought me in.

04:35.804 --> 04:39.139
Sit down.

04:39.141 --> 04:41.976
Police raffle.
You're the big winner.

04:49.653 --> 04:51.654
Where's the money you owe?

04:51.656 --> 04:54.458
What?
We don't pay the police.

04:54.460 --> 04:59.129
We kick back to the mob.

05:03.201 --> 05:06.970
That chapter's closed.
You pay HR now.

05:06.972 --> 05:10.507
Where is my money?

05:10.509 --> 05:11.741
- I can't hear you.
- All right.

05:11.743 --> 05:13.944
I'll get your money.

05:13.946 --> 05:18.515
But I gotta take you there.

05:20.986 --> 05:24.956
You go with him and get it.

05:24.958 --> 05:28.193
Based on her remarks
at the bar,

05:28.195 --> 05:31.530
sounds like Detective Carter
is eyeing Fusco.

05:31.532 --> 05:32.798
Isn't it time we told her

05:32.800 --> 05:35.435
that he's working with HR
at our behest?

05:35.437 --> 05:37.103
Not yet.

05:37.105 --> 05:38.705
And after all that talk
about honesty.

05:38.707 --> 05:40.606
It's safer for both of them.

05:40.608 --> 05:42.308
The less people
who know about Fusco,

05:42.310 --> 05:43.876
the less danger he's in.

05:43.878 --> 05:45.744
So now you're protecting Fusco?

05:45.746 --> 05:48.513
I'm protecting an asset.

05:48.515 --> 05:50.681
Who's the new number?

05:50.683 --> 05:54.385
Tommy Clay.
Lives in Queens.

05:54.387 --> 05:56.386
Married ten years
to wife Joyce.

05:56.388 --> 05:58.956
They have
a nine-year-old son.

05:58.958 --> 06:00.124
No criminal record.

06:00.126 --> 06:02.025
He pays his taxes,
goes to church

06:02.027 --> 06:04.427
every Sunday
except during football season.

06:04.429 --> 06:07.797
An ordinary guy.
What's the threat?

06:07.799 --> 06:10.967
Did I mention what
our number does for a living?

06:10.969 --> 06:13.703
Tommy Clay works
for Grayling Armored Services.

06:13.705 --> 06:16.739
You'll be a trainee
working under him,

06:16.741 --> 06:18.774
and today is training day.

06:18.776 --> 06:20.776
The crew consists of a driver,

06:20.778 --> 06:25.380
Murray Langston, been working
at grayling for 20 years.

06:25.382 --> 06:26.481
Tommy is the hopper,

06:26.483 --> 06:27.949
the most dangerous position
on the crew,

06:27.951 --> 06:29.117
because he has
to leave the truck

06:29.119 --> 06:30.951
to pick up and drop off cargo.

06:30.953 --> 06:34.288
And then there's the guard,
which is you.

06:34.290 --> 06:36.323
If the machine
gave us Tommy's number...

06:36.325 --> 06:38.892
Somebody's probably
planning a robbery.

06:38.894 --> 06:40.560
73% of all armored car robberies

06:40.562 --> 06:42.396
happen when the hopper's
away from the truck,

06:42.398 --> 06:47.668
so if they're gonna hit you,
that's when it'll happen.

06:47.670 --> 06:49.203
GSM link established.

06:49.205 --> 06:52.306
The plate reader will scan any
license in its line of sight.

06:52.308 --> 06:54.542
Let us know if anyone's
following the truck,

06:54.544 --> 06:57.312
casing it for a robbery.

06:57.314 --> 07:01.116
First thing, we don't always
know what we're carrying.

07:01.118 --> 07:02.851
It's not on the manifest?

07:02.853 --> 07:06.287
Not specifics, John.
Your name's John, right?

07:06.289 --> 07:07.989
Sometimes a client
tells us what it is.

07:07.991 --> 07:09.390
Sometimes they don't.

07:09.392 --> 07:11.158
So treat every day
as if you're gonna get hit.

07:11.160 --> 07:13.927
That's a good philosophy
for life.

07:13.929 --> 07:17.864
Hey, Murray,
Johnny here is a philosopher.

07:17.866 --> 07:19.866
Smart.

07:19.868 --> 07:22.703
He must have deep thoughts.

07:22.705 --> 07:26.774
Just don't get caught
napping on my watch.

07:28.143 --> 07:31.245
These guys aren't ready
for any real threat, Finch.

07:31.247 --> 07:32.280
Their vests are loose,

07:32.282 --> 07:34.048
magazines are stored
the wrong way...

07:34.050 --> 07:36.050
We need to put a face
to the threat.

07:36.052 --> 07:37.552
Cross-checking every plate
from the reader

07:37.554 --> 07:40.789
to see if
they're being followed.

07:43.593 --> 07:45.795
You almost look like
you know what you're doing.

07:45.797 --> 07:48.331
- Did you miss me?
- More than you know.

07:48.333 --> 07:50.768
- Watch my back, hero.
- Found something.

07:50.770 --> 07:53.304
One plate comes up
three times today.

07:53.306 --> 07:55.940
Someone's following the truck.

07:55.942 --> 07:57.909
I got guys headed
this way with guns.

07:57.911 --> 08:00.945
- Southeast corner.
- Go, go, go, go.

08:00.947 --> 08:04.816
What's happening,
Mr. Reese?

08:04.818 --> 08:08.386
John, back here!
Help!

08:08.388 --> 08:11.923
Mr. Reese?

08:18.699 --> 08:20.598
Smile, rookie!

08:20.600 --> 08:22.400
Hey, relax, Johnny.

08:22.402 --> 08:24.202
That's not a toy, you know.

08:24.204 --> 08:25.837
You could kill somebody
with that thing.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.808
All right, you got me.

08:29.810 --> 08:32.610
False alarm, Finch.
It was just a prank.

08:32.611 --> 08:34.746
Well, that's enduring.

08:34.748 --> 08:36.981
Unfortunately, the machine
never issues a false alarm.

08:36.982 --> 08:40.451
The robbery will happen.

08:40.453 --> 08:43.654
And when it does,
this crew's in big trouble.

08:56.951 --> 08:59.485
How's our guy doing?

08:59.487 --> 09:01.987
I'm making progress,
softening him up a bit.

09:01.989 --> 09:04.422
Doesn't matter.
You've been reassigned.

09:04.424 --> 09:07.825
You head out tonight.
China.

09:07.827 --> 09:09.794
No can do.

09:09.796 --> 09:12.930
I need to take leave--
Family emergency.

09:12.932 --> 09:14.932
You don't have
any family, Reese,

09:14.934 --> 09:17.834
and I've been assured
that the situation is... urgent.

09:17.836 --> 09:20.270
So find someone else.

09:20.272 --> 09:22.738
There's no time
to find someone else.

09:22.740 --> 09:25.074
We've lost control
of a certain item.

09:25.076 --> 09:27.042
Securing it is
the highest priority.

09:27.044 --> 09:29.944
- Do you understand?
- We understand.

09:29.946 --> 09:33.681
You lost something.
You need us to get it back.

09:33.683 --> 09:34.648
What are we looking for?

09:34.650 --> 09:37.217
Are you familiar with Stuxnet?

09:37.219 --> 09:38.652
Computer virus.

09:38.654 --> 09:42.456
Built by us to disable
the iranian nuclear program.

09:42.458 --> 09:44.725
The package you're looking
for is similar.

09:44.727 --> 09:46.560
Only this one
targets the Chinese.

09:46.562 --> 09:47.628
That's correct.

09:47.630 --> 09:49.630
We believe someone
inside the Pentagon

09:49.632 --> 09:50.965
sold a secure laptop containing

09:50.967 --> 09:54.301
some of the source code
to a Chinese firm.

09:54.303 --> 09:58.038
They may be studying the code
to inoculate their devices,

09:58.040 --> 09:59.340
or they may be
modifying the code

09:59.342 --> 10:02.476
to target the US
nuclear infrastructure.

10:02.478 --> 10:06.180
Either way,
we need the laptop returned.

10:06.182 --> 10:08.382
- Where are we going?
- Ordos.

10:08.384 --> 10:10.051
It's a company town
in the middle of China.

10:10.053 --> 10:11.986
It was built
for a million people,

10:11.988 --> 10:13.588
only the company
that built it folded.

10:13.590 --> 10:16.023
It's a ghost town.
No residents.

10:16.025 --> 10:18.226
So you're gonna
fly into Beijing.

10:18.228 --> 10:20.595
Diplomatic cover,
two weeks to gather intel,

10:20.597 --> 10:22.197
then you're going in.

10:22.199 --> 10:25.066
The laptop has to be handled
with extreme caution,

10:25.068 --> 10:29.371
so no phones.
No network devices of any kind.

10:29.373 --> 10:32.306
This software will exploit
any open communication channel.

10:32.308 --> 10:36.510
Understood?

10:39.181 --> 10:43.183
Let's go.

10:43.185 --> 10:44.518
Reese.

10:44.520 --> 10:47.921
One more thing.

10:47.923 --> 10:51.257
After you secure the package,

10:51.259 --> 10:55.160
you're to retire Agent Stanton.

10:55.162 --> 10:56.962
You're telling me
to kill my partner?

10:56.964 --> 10:58.564
We've intercepted
unauthorized communications

10:58.566 --> 11:01.233
between her and this man,

11:01.235 --> 11:03.268
a go-between
for Hezbollah.

11:03.270 --> 11:05.304
Large deposits
into an off-shore account.

11:05.306 --> 11:08.007
She's been compromised.

11:08.009 --> 11:11.544
As her partner,
you should have noticed.

11:11.546 --> 11:13.780
We clean up
our own mess, Reese.

11:13.782 --> 11:16.415
You know that.

11:16.417 --> 11:21.820
You get this done, you can
have all the leave you need.

11:21.822 --> 11:25.457
You understand?

11:43.910 --> 11:45.711
This is Jessica.
You missed me.

11:45.713 --> 11:49.681
Leave a message.

11:55.288 --> 11:57.556
What are we looking at?

11:57.558 --> 11:59.424
I've hacked
the truck company's servers

11:59.426 --> 12:01.460
and retrieved your route
for today.

12:01.462 --> 12:02.760
If I know the pickup locations,

12:02.762 --> 12:04.795
I can narrow down
where the robber might hit.

12:04.797 --> 12:05.763
Carter get back to you

12:05.765 --> 12:07.732
on the plate
of the car following us?

12:07.734 --> 12:10.935
Not yet.

12:12.772 --> 12:14.872
Lionel, you've been quiet.

12:14.874 --> 12:16.474
I was getting worried.

12:16.476 --> 12:19.476
Yeah, it's like the wild,
wild west out here with Lynch.

12:19.478 --> 12:21.945
HR's getting short on funds
since we took down Elias,

12:21.947 --> 12:25.414
so he's chasing down street
money with a baseball bat.

12:25.416 --> 12:28.117
Not like I didn't have
enough enemies on the street.

12:28.119 --> 12:29.118
Keep gathering intel.

12:29.120 --> 12:30.586
We need to know
their leadership.

12:30.588 --> 12:32.187
Take down
the remaining players.

12:32.189 --> 12:35.557
At least I'm getting a cut
for my efforts.

12:35.559 --> 12:36.892
What do you want me to do
with the money?

12:36.894 --> 12:39.428
I care about HR, Fusco,
not the money.

12:39.430 --> 12:42.297
What you do with it
is your business.

12:42.299 --> 12:43.798
Ah.

12:45.335 --> 12:48.837
- Hey, dad.
- Hey, buddy.

12:56.312 --> 12:57.646
What do you say
I take you after practice,

12:57.648 --> 12:58.747
get you some new gear?

12:58.749 --> 13:03.118
- Really?
- Yeah, why not?

13:04.420 --> 13:05.954
These pictures you sent over

13:05.956 --> 13:07.389
look suspiciously like the ones

13:07.391 --> 13:09.824
from <i>our</i> automated
license plate readers.

13:09.826 --> 13:11.292
Did you take one off my car?

13:11.294 --> 13:14.362
Well, no...
Not your car.

13:14.364 --> 13:15.797
I'll pretend
I didn't hear that.

13:15.799 --> 13:20.068
Anyway, the plate belongs
to a '95 gray Chevrolet van,

13:20.070 --> 13:23.039
registered to the 72-year-old
transit authority administrator.

13:23.041 --> 13:25.842
A 72-year-old that's
casing an armored car?

13:25.844 --> 13:28.511
That's why I dug
a little deeper.

13:28.513 --> 13:30.947
Apparently the owner's nephew,
Frank Lowell,

13:30.949 --> 13:32.616
was paroled two months ago.

13:32.618 --> 13:35.085
Busted back in '05
for armed robbery,

13:35.087 --> 13:38.556
along with buddy, Mick Norton,
released last year.

13:38.558 --> 13:41.626
I just sent the photos to you.

13:41.628 --> 13:43.427
You might need help
with these two.

13:43.429 --> 13:46.296
I got it covered.

13:52.903 --> 13:55.238
Hey, did you catch up
on your beauty sleep, sunshine?

13:55.240 --> 13:57.340
Not so much.

13:57.342 --> 13:59.876
I had a nightmare I was working
with a bunch of clowns.

13:59.878 --> 14:00.910
Yeah, well, that's Tommy.

14:00.912 --> 14:03.079
He's always clowning around.

14:03.081 --> 14:06.583
Is that Tommy's wife?

14:06.585 --> 14:08.919
Talk about a ball buster.

14:08.921 --> 14:11.789
I celebrate
the anniversary of my divorce

14:11.791 --> 14:13.291
like it's new year's Eve.

14:13.293 --> 14:14.592
This job is stressful enough.

14:14.594 --> 14:17.361
No one needs that nonsense
to come home to, no.

14:17.363 --> 14:21.298
Marriage is a racket.

14:21.300 --> 14:23.600
Back for more, John?

14:23.602 --> 14:26.470
Oh, I see Murray here skipped
his morning pilates again.

14:26.472 --> 14:29.806
Yeah, I'm starting
a new French toast regimen.

14:29.808 --> 14:31.641
- Who's your friend, Tommy?
- Hey.

14:31.643 --> 14:33.977
John the newbie, Ashley.

14:33.979 --> 14:36.713
He needs to learn the ropes,
and I'm the ropes master.

14:36.715 --> 14:37.814
What are you having, hon?

14:37.816 --> 14:39.549
Something you can
put in the bag.

14:39.551 --> 14:41.251
I always stick
with a fried egg sandwich.

14:41.253 --> 14:44.989
Yeah, but that's because you
can't read the rest of the menu.

14:44.991 --> 14:46.224
Coffee's fine, thank you.

14:46.226 --> 14:47.893
Whoa, that's
a nice bracelet, huh?

14:47.895 --> 14:49.928
Who's the lucky stiff, Ashley?

14:49.930 --> 14:52.197
It's nothing. It's just
a present from my grandma.

14:52.199 --> 14:53.599
She's got good taste.

14:53.601 --> 14:55.234
I threw in
a little extra hot sauce

14:55.236 --> 14:56.936
with your sandwich, Tommy.

14:56.938 --> 14:59.539
Whoa, Tommy, you got
a little extra hot sauce, huh?

14:59.541 --> 15:01.674
Hey, married man over here.

15:01.676 --> 15:03.809
Yeah, more like half a man.

15:03.811 --> 15:05.010
All right, ladies,
time to punch in.

15:05.012 --> 15:06.211
Let's go.

15:06.213 --> 15:08.514
So what's your story, John?

15:08.516 --> 15:10.516
You ever been a security guard
anywhere else?

15:10.518 --> 15:12.218
- Here and there.
- Mall cop?

15:12.220 --> 15:14.153
Supermarket stiff?

15:14.155 --> 15:15.921
Something like that.

15:15.923 --> 15:18.123
All I'm saying is,
this ain't Walmart.

15:18.125 --> 15:20.292
You ever been robbed before?

15:20.294 --> 15:22.294
Once.

15:22.296 --> 15:24.430
My partner and I were
servicing this ATM.

15:24.432 --> 15:25.798
These two guys
came up with guns.

15:25.800 --> 15:28.567
I tried to be a hero.
Took two in the vest.

15:28.569 --> 15:30.502
They got away.

15:30.504 --> 15:34.740
I got a set of cracked ribs
and a bump in hazard pay.

15:34.742 --> 15:37.009
Don't worry.
Most of the job is like this,

15:37.011 --> 15:38.845
you know?
Sitting around in traffic,

15:38.847 --> 15:42.716
trying not to get carsick.

15:42.718 --> 15:46.720
If the bullets don't get you,
the boredom will.

15:46.722 --> 15:49.456
I've just flagged
the gray van's license plate,

15:49.458 --> 15:51.024
so the plate reader
will alert us

15:51.026 --> 15:53.360
just as soon
as it appears again.

15:53.362 --> 15:54.862
I've also been able
to retrieve some information

15:54.864 --> 15:57.431
from the company's database
about your stops today.

15:57.433 --> 16:00.400
One state bank.

16:00.402 --> 16:03.136
Your cargo is

16:03.138 --> 16:06.806
their employees' tax returns.

16:08.743 --> 16:12.678
Your next stop,
Heliogem Incorporated.

16:12.680 --> 16:14.513
But the shipment
is just low-grade stones

16:14.515 --> 16:15.881
for industrial use.

16:15.883 --> 16:20.019
Next stop is
Regan Medical Supply,

16:20.021 --> 16:24.958
manufacturers of...
pacemakers, among other things.

16:24.960 --> 16:26.192
Those are expensive,

16:26.194 --> 16:29.696
hardly something
you can fence on the street.

16:32.868 --> 16:36.037
- Heading your way, Murray.
- Hang on.

16:36.039 --> 16:38.038
The internal manifest shows
that you're actually

16:38.040 --> 16:41.375
picking up raw materials
for pacemakers.

16:41.377 --> 16:44.578
Platinum.

16:46.414 --> 16:47.915
Platinum is priced at

16:47.917 --> 16:49.183
$1,600 an ounce.

16:49.185 --> 16:51.551
That approximately
$25,000 a pound.

16:51.553 --> 16:53.286
There's 50 pound--

16:53.288 --> 16:57.457
Mr. Reese, those cases are worth
about $1.25 million.

16:57.459 --> 16:59.926
That must be the target.

16:59.928 --> 17:01.428
Wow, bro.

17:01.430 --> 17:06.068
You need to relax.

17:12.777 --> 17:14.410
Come on, Murray, let's go.

17:18.982 --> 17:20.383
I don't understand.

17:20.385 --> 17:22.417
The robbery should have
taken place at the last stop.

17:22.420 --> 17:25.855
All you've got left is
DeWitt Grocery.

17:25.857 --> 17:27.756
That's inconsequential
compared--

17:53.718 --> 17:58.055
Stay here.

18:31.126 --> 18:33.362
Come on, let's go.

18:37.601 --> 18:40.902
Mr. Reese?
Mr. Reese?

18:58.969 --> 19:00.669
Alpha team is on-site.

19:00.671 --> 19:03.639
They've got their owners,
and we've got ours.

19:03.641 --> 19:08.877
I'll let you know
when it's done.

19:10.179 --> 19:11.680
This is where we part ways.

19:11.682 --> 19:13.048
You're going in alone.

19:13.050 --> 19:15.984
Intel says you can expect
only light resistance.

19:15.986 --> 19:19.254
I've got orders to confiscate
any comm devices you have.

19:22.091 --> 19:23.391
How do we signal for extract?

19:23.393 --> 19:26.359
Use these.
IR chem lights.

19:26.361 --> 19:28.862
A helo's going to meet you
at the LZ.

19:28.864 --> 19:30.563
You've got 72 hours.

19:30.565 --> 19:33.832
We got orders
to make our own way back.

19:42.008 --> 19:44.644
Bird flu must have been
a cover.

19:44.646 --> 19:46.079
The place is under quarantine.

19:46.081 --> 19:48.715
Scaring the locals.

19:48.717 --> 19:51.084
A lot of precautions
for a computer virus.

19:51.086 --> 19:53.687
I'm not sure we're being told
the whole story here.

19:53.689 --> 19:58.192
"Ours is not to reason why."
Isn't that what you taught me?

19:58.194 --> 20:01.695
And I thought
you weren't listening.

20:10.872 --> 20:15.075
Looks like we're
a little late to the party.

20:15.077 --> 20:16.643
Mr. Reese.

20:16.645 --> 20:18.678
Mr. Reese?

20:18.680 --> 20:20.346
You got that ID running?

20:20.348 --> 20:22.315
Mr. Reese?

20:22.317 --> 20:24.818
- What's happening, doctor?
- We're losing him.

20:24.820 --> 20:27.387
Standing by. OR three.

20:27.389 --> 20:30.958
- BP 70/52.
- I'm getting no pulse at all.

20:30.960 --> 20:34.060
All right, I'm calling.

20:43.639 --> 20:46.873
Looks like you
could use some help.

20:49.811 --> 20:52.412
Come on.
Hold on to me.

20:58.720 --> 20:59.753
Bruised ribs.

20:59.755 --> 21:01.354
Bullet hit the vest,
broke the skin.

21:01.356 --> 21:04.191
You're lucky it's not worse.

21:04.193 --> 21:07.195
I wasn't supposed
to help Tommy.

21:07.197 --> 21:08.930
I was supposed to stop him.

21:08.932 --> 21:10.398
Yeah, well, most inside jobs,

21:10.400 --> 21:13.269
guy leaves a door open,
takes a cut.

21:13.271 --> 21:15.838
Guy comes out
blasting like this,

21:15.840 --> 21:18.508
he better have a well-
thought-out exit strategy.

21:18.510 --> 21:20.709
This guy's got a family.

21:20.711 --> 21:22.978
Yeah, we're searching
his house right now,

21:22.980 --> 21:26.381
bringing his wife in
for questioning.

21:26.383 --> 21:28.349
He's got to be
working with somebody.

21:28.351 --> 21:30.851
Well, he needs a fence.

21:30.853 --> 21:32.720
He's still got
to flip that platinum.

21:32.722 --> 21:36.523
Hmm.

21:36.525 --> 21:38.325
Yeah?

21:38.327 --> 21:40.427
He's right here with me.

21:40.429 --> 21:41.795
Oh, thank God.

21:43.266 --> 21:45.199
I tracked your phone
to a hospital, but...

21:45.201 --> 21:47.301
- I didn't know--
- It's okay, Harold.

21:47.303 --> 21:49.204
I'm still ticking.

21:49.206 --> 21:50.505
Well, I'm watching
the feed that

21:50.507 --> 21:52.107
we piggybacked off the internal
camera in the truck.

21:52.109 --> 21:53.909
Tommy had a second phone.

21:53.911 --> 21:56.011
Sent a text just
before the robbery.

21:56.013 --> 21:58.681
He must have been signaling
the other robbers.

21:58.683 --> 22:00.283
Well, we gotta track him,
Finch.

22:00.285 --> 22:03.453
I've got to stop Tommy
before he hurts anyone else.

22:03.455 --> 22:06.456
Oh!

22:13.233 --> 22:15.767
Used to play pickup games here
when I was a kid.

22:15.769 --> 22:18.603
You were a kid?

22:18.605 --> 22:22.840
Got into some fights.
Learned how to use my fists.

22:24.943 --> 22:26.811
I need you to do something.

22:26.813 --> 22:29.914
What?

22:29.916 --> 22:31.816
Pick up something in Brooklyn.

22:31.818 --> 22:37.022
Details to follow.

22:37.024 --> 22:40.425
Failure's not an option.

22:40.427 --> 22:45.297
I know you understand
what I'm saying.

22:52.572 --> 22:54.807
Where's your husband,
Mrs. Clay?

22:54.809 --> 22:57.776
I don't know.

22:57.778 --> 22:59.978
I haven't talked
to Tommy all day.

22:59.980 --> 23:02.248
Yeah, well, he's been busy.

23:02.250 --> 23:05.151
He robbed his own truck,
shot two people,

23:05.153 --> 23:07.120
and you still
haven't heard from him.

23:07.122 --> 23:10.190
Tommy is a good person.

23:10.192 --> 23:13.326
He's never talked about
stealing anything off a truck.

23:13.328 --> 23:16.395
Is that right?

23:16.397 --> 23:20.399
Found this in a closet
in your house.

23:20.401 --> 23:22.335
It's for a diamond tennis bracelet,

23:22.337 --> 23:27.140
part of a shipment
Tommy delivered two days ago.

23:27.142 --> 23:30.243
But I guess
it just fell off the truck.

23:30.245 --> 23:34.214
A diamond what?

23:38.152 --> 23:41.387
Tommy didn't give you
a bracelet, did he?

23:47.728 --> 23:49.429
Tommy's having an affair,

23:49.431 --> 23:51.831
so if we find his girlfriend,
we'll find him.

23:51.833 --> 23:55.401
I'm way ahead of you,
Detective.

23:58.472 --> 24:02.842
- Top off?
- Absolutely.

24:06.981 --> 24:09.984
- Anything yet, Finch?
- Yes, as a matter of fact.

24:09.986 --> 24:11.886
One number in her call history

24:11.888 --> 24:13.921
comes up several times
in the last hour.

24:13.923 --> 24:15.189
No name on the account.

24:15.191 --> 24:17.825
Could be Tommy
on a burner phone.

24:17.827 --> 24:19.994
- Can you track him?
- We'll see.

24:19.996 --> 24:24.398
I'm texting him an alluring
photo from Ashley's archive,

24:24.400 --> 24:27.134
hoping it'll get
a quick response.

24:27.136 --> 24:29.269
When he opens the message,

24:29.271 --> 24:32.138
a spyware trojan
embedded in the file

24:32.140 --> 24:33.706
will send his GPS coordinates.

24:33.708 --> 24:35.008
Good.

24:35.010 --> 24:39.111
Mr. Reese, I got a hit
on Tommy's burner phone.

24:39.113 --> 24:41.881
He last checked it
from the Royce motel.

24:55.662 --> 24:59.298
Tommy's not here.

24:59.300 --> 25:01.466
It looks like the robbers
that were with him are dead.

25:01.468 --> 25:03.601
He's cutting his ties
to the heist,

25:03.603 --> 25:06.171
keeping the loot for himself.

25:06.173 --> 25:08.172
Bodies are still warm.

25:08.174 --> 25:11.775
Tommy's still here.

25:17.648 --> 25:20.083
Hold it.

25:40.086 --> 25:42.854
So much for the bird flu.

25:42.856 --> 25:44.890
These people were gunned down.

25:44.892 --> 25:48.860
Software engineers,
not soldiers.

25:48.862 --> 25:53.299
Why kill them?

25:55.770 --> 25:59.071
We got a live one here.
Mostly alive.

26:02.925 --> 26:05.079
_

26:06.910 --> 26:08.400
_

26:08.698 --> 26:09.822
_

26:10.479 --> 26:11.965
_

26:13.249 --> 26:14.803
_

26:15.779 --> 26:16.866
_

26:18.679 --> 26:20.905
_

26:23.865 --> 26:25.099
what did he say?

26:28.405 --> 26:32.273
He said he wanted
something for the pain.

26:34.176 --> 26:38.546
Action here was clean.

26:38.548 --> 26:41.648
Fast.

26:41.650 --> 26:46.353
BMR recon team maybe
or hired guns.

27:06.308 --> 27:09.577
Looks like the package.

27:18.254 --> 27:23.025
Why kill all these people
and leave it behind?

27:23.027 --> 27:25.128
Maybe they copied it.

27:25.130 --> 27:28.064
Or altered it
and left it for us to find.

27:28.066 --> 27:33.137
Helo won't be able
to pick us up till dark.

27:33.139 --> 27:36.907
We need a safe place
to wait for extract.

27:36.909 --> 27:38.608
Safe from whom?

27:38.610 --> 27:42.278
We're the only living people
in this city.

27:42.280 --> 27:45.480
After you.

27:54.656 --> 27:56.691
I should've shot you
and simplified my life.

27:56.693 --> 27:58.493
Pressure getting to you,
Lionel?

27:58.495 --> 28:00.496
- Why are you here?
- Len sent me over.

28:00.498 --> 28:02.164
Presupposed to meet a guy
by the name of Clay.

28:02.166 --> 28:03.899
HR looking
for a cut of the heist?

28:03.901 --> 28:05.401
HR helped set up the heist.

28:05.403 --> 28:06.569
They hand-picked the shooters.

28:06.571 --> 28:08.304
I'm supposed to be
picking up their cut.

28:08.306 --> 28:11.341
You've got a problem.
Tommy Clay's long gone.

28:11.343 --> 28:14.978
And he left his buddies behind.

28:18.783 --> 28:22.552
Ah, jeez.

28:25.255 --> 28:26.355
I don't come back
with the platinum,

28:26.357 --> 28:27.323
hr's gonna think I took it.

28:27.325 --> 28:28.390
That makes me a dead man.

28:28.392 --> 28:29.692
You gotta help me with this.

28:29.694 --> 28:31.560
You got me working with
these guys in the first place.

28:31.562 --> 28:32.928
I'll find Tommy.

28:32.930 --> 28:34.830
- Now off you go.
- Off I go?

28:34.832 --> 28:36.398
What am I gonna tell HR, huh?

28:36.400 --> 28:39.168
You're a talented liar,
Detective, remember?

28:39.170 --> 28:42.338
That's why I picked you.

28:45.009 --> 28:48.112
- You there, Finch?
- Always.

28:48.114 --> 28:50.047
If you're calling to ask
where Tommy is, I don't know.

28:50.049 --> 28:52.249
He destroyed his phone
as soon as he left the motel.

28:52.251 --> 28:54.318
Get anything off the phone?

28:54.320 --> 28:55.386
Only that he uses
the name Ashley

28:55.388 --> 28:58.188
as a password
on almost everything.

28:58.190 --> 29:00.023
Ashley from the diner?

29:00.025 --> 29:02.559
- Must be love.
- And it's mutual.

29:02.561 --> 29:04.961
I checked
her credit card transactions.

29:04.963 --> 29:07.263
She just charged
over $5,000 worth

29:07.265 --> 29:09.431
of Louis Vuitton suitcases.

29:09.433 --> 29:11.100
She's running off with Tommy.

29:11.102 --> 29:13.969
I'll try to intercept her,
and you try to track down Tommy.

29:13.971 --> 29:17.139
I'm not sure he deserves
our protection, Mr. Reese.

29:17.141 --> 29:18.640
He killed his friend
in cold blood

29:18.642 --> 29:20.709
and shot me in the back.

29:20.711 --> 29:22.377
I wasn't thinking
of protecting him.

29:22.379 --> 29:25.013
You're telling me this guy
killed two of our men

29:25.015 --> 29:26.781
and took off
with all the platinum?

29:26.783 --> 29:27.849
Maybe it's beginner's luck.

29:27.851 --> 29:30.452
Getting ambitious, Detective?

29:30.454 --> 29:32.987
Working an angle?

29:32.989 --> 29:34.289
Look, you don't believe me,
go to the hotel.

29:34.291 --> 29:36.658
There's two dead bodies
and two empty cases.

29:36.660 --> 29:38.226
Thing about angles, Fusco,

29:38.228 --> 29:41.028
you add 'em up,
always comes out the same.

29:42.165 --> 29:43.297
You know, the longer
we stand here talking,

29:43.299 --> 29:44.632
the further distance
this kid Tommy

29:44.634 --> 29:46.100
is gonna put
between us and our money.

29:46.102 --> 29:48.503
Assuming you're not
shining me on,

29:48.505 --> 29:50.872
there's only so many places
he could fence the platinum.

29:50.874 --> 29:52.307
So where are they?
We'll divvy them up.

29:52.309 --> 29:55.310
No.
We do it together.

29:55.312 --> 29:57.746
That way I can keep
an eye on you.

29:57.748 --> 30:00.681
- Such a long day.
- Oh, I know.

30:00.683 --> 30:01.616
Just want to go home.

30:01.618 --> 30:05.586
- Call me.
- Talk to you later? Bye.

30:12.359 --> 30:15.295
Hello, Ashley.

30:15.297 --> 30:17.029
- Get out of my car.
- No.

30:17.031 --> 30:20.566
Sorry.

30:20.568 --> 30:22.168
You work with Tommy.

30:22.170 --> 30:24.237
What do you want?

30:24.239 --> 30:26.339
You know,
that is a nice bracelet.

30:26.341 --> 30:30.343
Grandma didn't give it to you,
did she?

30:30.345 --> 30:31.711
But I know who did.

30:31.713 --> 30:35.915
Where is he?
Where's Tommy, Ashley?

30:35.917 --> 30:39.085
I don't know.

30:42.022 --> 30:43.489
Honestly, I don't.

30:43.491 --> 30:45.691
What do you mean?

30:45.693 --> 30:48.994
I'm supposed
to wait for him here.

30:48.996 --> 30:52.231
He was gonna pick me up
three hours ago,

30:52.233 --> 30:58.237
so either something terrible
has happened to him or...

30:59.606 --> 31:01.040
He's gone without me.

31:01.042 --> 31:04.610
What was your plan?

31:04.612 --> 31:07.847
I never should
have believed him.

31:07.849 --> 31:09.449
He said he was going
to take me away from all this,

31:09.451 --> 31:11.884
and we were gonna go
to Cabo together.

31:11.886 --> 31:17.556
Well, at least you got
your nice Louis Vuitton bags.

31:20.694 --> 31:23.328
This Tommy's turned out
to be a real operator, Finch.

31:23.330 --> 31:24.463
And right now,
he's putting everyone

31:24.465 --> 31:25.697
in his rearview mirror.

31:25.699 --> 31:28.233
- You got anything?
- Tommy's a creature of habit.

31:28.235 --> 31:30.435
Uses the same password
for everything.

31:30.437 --> 31:32.904
His other habit is buying
Symetel burner phones.

31:32.906 --> 31:36.141
Symetel leases their numbers
in consecutive blocks.

31:36.143 --> 31:38.811
I wrote a script trying
the password "Ashley"

31:38.813 --> 31:40.313
on all new numbers,

31:40.315 --> 31:42.950
and I found his new phone.

31:42.952 --> 31:45.386
Along with web-based voicemail
message he received. Listen.

31:45.388 --> 31:46.754
Got your message.

31:46.756 --> 31:49.390
Arturo's Boxing Club.
I'll be there in an hour.

31:49.392 --> 31:52.727
My guess is this is the man
Tommy's selling the platinum to.

31:52.729 --> 31:55.263
Message was received
45 minutes ago.

31:55.265 --> 31:57.465
On my way.
Give Carter the address.

31:57.467 --> 32:01.336
I'll wrap Tommy up,
give him to her.

32:08.911 --> 32:10.077
What's up?

32:10.079 --> 32:12.613
Got a location
on the armored truck robber--

32:12.615 --> 32:14.781
Arturo's Boxing Club in Queens.

32:14.783 --> 32:17.952
- John's on his way there.
- Carter.

32:17.954 --> 32:18.919
Detective, did you hear me?

32:18.921 --> 32:20.287
Hang up.
The CIA's onto me.

32:20.289 --> 32:23.391
You'll have to handle this
on your own.

32:23.393 --> 32:28.129
Agent Snow and...
whatever your name is.

32:28.131 --> 32:31.199
- Evans.
- What do you want?

32:31.201 --> 32:33.335
Oh, to say hi, see how you are.

32:33.337 --> 32:36.939
I'm fine.
What do you want?

32:36.941 --> 32:39.307
We know that you're talking
to the FBI about Reese.

32:39.309 --> 32:40.676
Is there a law against that?

32:40.678 --> 32:43.478
As they've proven
time and again,

32:43.480 --> 32:46.615
the FBI cannot be trusted with
matters of national security.

32:46.617 --> 32:48.984
Do not talk to Agent Donnelly.

32:48.986 --> 32:50.953
Oh, you mean
about our mutual friend.

32:50.955 --> 32:55.258
Why, you're afraid Donnelly's
gonna get to him first?

32:55.260 --> 32:58.462
What exactly are you worried
he's gonna tell him?

32:58.464 --> 33:01.098
Be careful, Detective.

33:01.100 --> 33:03.299
We're closing the net on John.

33:03.301 --> 33:07.171
He's good at hiding,
but I'm good at finding people.

33:07.173 --> 33:09.173
And when I do,
you're gonna want

33:09.175 --> 33:10.775
to be on the right side
of this thing.

33:10.777 --> 33:15.080
Don't talk to Donnelly.

33:19.953 --> 33:22.252
Mr. Reese, I'm afraid
you're on your own now.

33:22.254 --> 33:25.655
Carter just had a visit from
your old colleagues in the CIA.

33:25.657 --> 33:27.290
Copy that.

33:32.296 --> 33:37.266
Who is it?

33:37.268 --> 33:39.469
Hey, Tommy.

33:39.471 --> 33:40.704
Johnny.

33:44.910 --> 33:46.810
That's for shooting me
in the back.

33:50.915 --> 33:53.751
That's for Murray.

33:53.753 --> 33:55.486
Where's the platinum?

33:55.488 --> 33:58.522
I'm not telling you.

33:58.524 --> 34:00.491
You won't get away with this.

34:00.493 --> 34:02.293
You have no idea
who you're dealing with.

34:02.295 --> 34:03.528
You think?

34:03.530 --> 34:06.464
I'm just as smart
as every one of those jerks.

34:06.466 --> 34:09.868
Tommy, you were clean.

34:09.870 --> 34:12.538
You had a wife, a kid,

34:12.540 --> 34:14.239
no prior record.

34:14.241 --> 34:16.808
But you threw it all away.
Why?

34:16.810 --> 34:18.909
Because every day
for the last ten years,

34:18.911 --> 34:20.411
I've protected
other people's money,

34:20.414 --> 34:23.614
and I have nothing
show for it. Nothing.

34:23.616 --> 34:25.382
So the world owes you,
is that it?

34:25.384 --> 34:26.650
No, it doesn't.

34:26.652 --> 34:29.753
I figured that one out.
Took a while.

34:29.755 --> 34:31.221
You know what else
I figured out?

34:31.223 --> 34:33.190
Hauling around
all that money--

34:33.192 --> 34:35.458
You get what you take.

34:35.460 --> 34:38.629
- So I'm taking mine.
- That's not gonna happen.

34:38.630 --> 34:41.299
The thing about striking out
on your own, Tommy,

34:41.301 --> 34:43.702
is that's usually
how you end up.

34:43.704 --> 34:45.771
Oh, yeah?

34:45.773 --> 34:48.873
I think you got that
just about right.

34:50.612 --> 34:51.643
Hi, Tommy.

34:51.646 --> 34:54.347
Hi, babes.

34:54.349 --> 34:58.584
Help me get rid
of this mope, will you?

35:19.088 --> 35:25.093
Spent decades trying to invent
the perfect nutritional ration.

35:25.095 --> 35:27.696
And it's still inedible.

35:27.698 --> 35:31.734
It's just a matter of time
before this is all obsolete.

35:31.736 --> 35:34.770
We'll still have to eat.

35:34.772 --> 35:36.472
I'm not talking about the MREs.

35:36.474 --> 35:41.276
You got satellites
replacing surveillance teams,

35:41.278 --> 35:45.748
drones replacing
fighter pilots.

35:45.750 --> 35:50.552
So we've outlived
our usefulness?

35:50.554 --> 35:55.257
We'll be replaced by a push
of a button, is that it?

35:55.259 --> 35:59.461
What do you think?

35:59.463 --> 36:03.999
I think we're still here.

36:04.001 --> 36:08.570
You ever wonder
where we get our intel?

36:08.572 --> 36:14.007
I thought
you didn't ask questions,

36:14.009 --> 36:15.809
just followed orders.

36:15.811 --> 36:20.213
I never said it was easy.

36:24.017 --> 36:26.652
Sun's setting.

36:26.654 --> 36:31.057
Time to go.

36:54.015 --> 36:56.084
Yeah?

36:56.086 --> 36:57.752
Our friend is
in a bit of trouble.

36:57.754 --> 36:58.787
We need your help.

36:58.789 --> 37:00.556
Who are you talking to?

37:00.558 --> 37:03.959
Uh, I'm busy right now.
I can't talk.

37:03.961 --> 37:09.097
My ex.

37:09.099 --> 37:12.968
Now you're going to tell me
who's coming for us.

37:12.970 --> 37:14.302
Where's the platinum, Tommy?

37:14.304 --> 37:16.337
It's over there under the ring

37:16.339 --> 37:20.542
in that box with the gloves.

37:20.544 --> 37:23.278
So Ashley's the brains,
and you're the muscle.

37:23.280 --> 37:26.481
Is that right, Tommy?

37:26.483 --> 37:29.517
We're partners.

37:29.519 --> 37:33.988
She convinced you it was time
to make your move, didn't she?

37:33.990 --> 37:35.690
She said you deserve
more from life.

37:35.692 --> 37:40.161
Ignore him, Tommy.

37:47.469 --> 37:49.603
- I'm so sorry.
- Sorry?

37:49.605 --> 37:51.373
What are you sorry for?

37:51.375 --> 37:54.710
The law of the fishes.

37:54.712 --> 37:59.181
I should've seen it coming.

37:59.183 --> 38:01.017
What are you talking about?

38:01.019 --> 38:04.154
The people I help, I never know

38:04.156 --> 38:05.555
if they're gonna be
the victim or the perp,

38:05.557 --> 38:09.560
but I think, this time,
you're both.

38:19.406 --> 38:21.841
Now what?

38:21.843 --> 38:23.843
You think you're going
to walk out of here

38:23.845 --> 38:25.578
and live happily ever after?

38:25.580 --> 38:28.681
You're dealing
with some very bad people.

38:28.683 --> 38:29.682
Shut up.

38:29.684 --> 38:31.284
Right now, you have
what they want,

38:31.286 --> 38:34.954
and they won't stop
until they get it.

38:37.891 --> 38:41.159
First time you shot someone?

38:44.630 --> 38:49.667
First one's hard.

38:49.669 --> 38:53.070
You've probably been thinking
about it for a while,

38:53.072 --> 38:55.539
psyched yourself up.

38:55.541 --> 39:00.109
But the second one
can even be harder.

39:17.762 --> 39:19.296
All there?

39:19.298 --> 39:21.465
- Yeah.
- Heh, what do you know?

39:21.467 --> 39:24.001
You weren't lying after all.

39:24.003 --> 39:26.837
Well, look who's here...

39:26.839 --> 39:30.674
Carter's guardian angel.

39:30.676 --> 39:35.179
Thought our paths might
cross again at some point.

39:35.181 --> 39:39.083
I think it's your turn to hang
off the side of a building.

39:39.085 --> 39:42.519
Hey, forget him,
let's get out of here.

39:42.521 --> 39:44.754
You're right.

39:44.756 --> 39:47.291
I was gonna have some fun.

39:47.293 --> 39:51.795
But I'll just shoot him.

39:58.001 --> 40:00.469
Mr. Reese,
everything okay?

40:00.471 --> 40:02.571
Finch, we're going
to need your trunk.

40:02.573 --> 40:04.773
No, I got this one.

40:04.775 --> 40:07.209
I shot him with her gun.

40:07.211 --> 40:08.244
Simple enough to make it look

40:08.246 --> 40:11.881
like Lynch
botched the whole thing.

40:15.287 --> 40:17.488
You're getting good
at this, Lionel.

40:17.490 --> 40:19.390
I was always good at this.

40:19.392 --> 40:21.793
That's why you picked me
in the first place.

40:21.795 --> 40:27.098
Remember?

40:27.100 --> 40:30.268

Sorry, John.

40:54.127 --> 40:56.360
Nothing personal.

40:56.362 --> 40:58.295
They told me
you've been compromised,

40:58.297 --> 41:01.097
that as your partner,
it was my mess to clean up.

41:01.099 --> 41:04.601
Something funny?

41:04.603 --> 41:10.073
I got the same orders as you.

41:10.075 --> 41:14.645
Whoever sent us here doesn't
want us to retrieve the package.

41:14.647 --> 41:19.383
They want to confirm
it's destroyed.

41:19.385 --> 41:23.020
They want everyone who
had contact with it destroyed.

41:23.022 --> 41:26.591
And you just gave them
a beacon.

41:30.898 --> 41:34.433
- Target locked.
- You are clear to engage.

41:34.435 --> 41:35.868

We stopped Tommy

42:05.531 --> 42:08.198

Hey, we got a lead on Reese.

42:24.949 --> 42:26.582
An asset in North Korea,

42:26.584 --> 42:29.218
a dissident group helped
an injured CIA operative escape

42:29.220 --> 42:32.120
from a town near Ordos, China,
may 2010.

42:32.122 --> 42:33.788
Ordos?
Must be our guy.

42:33.790 --> 42:35.323
The asset pointed us
to a bank account

42:35.325 --> 42:36.357
out of Grand Cayman.

42:36.359 --> 42:38.292
Same account
was accessed two days ago

42:38.294 --> 42:40.895
at a bank across the street
