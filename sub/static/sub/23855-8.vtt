WEBVTT

00:16.516 --> 00:18.351
-Ms. Harper!
-Ms. Harper, have you arrested

00:18.435 --> 00:20.645
all four of the officers involved?

00:20.729 --> 00:22.480
-Is this a conspiracy?
-What are the charges?

00:22.564 --> 00:25.233
Is the JCPD cooperating
with your investigation?

00:25.316 --> 00:28.945
-What penalties are you seeking?
-Ms. Harper, was Brenton Butler murdered?

00:29.029 --> 00:30.613
Based on newly discovered evidence,

00:30.697 --> 00:34.200
we have arrested four police officers
from Jersey City's South District

00:34.284 --> 00:36.619
for their involvement in the death
of Brenton Butler.

00:36.703 --> 00:38.955
I'll announce formal charges
at a bail hearing tomorrow.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.332
When will you release the names
of the four cops arrested?

00:41.416 --> 00:42.584
Does this indicate a new...

00:44.127 --> 00:46.296
-They lawyered up yet?
-Before we got the cuffs on them.

00:46.379 --> 00:48.465
What do you expect?
They read the Miranda rights for a living.

00:48.548 --> 00:51.426
The way they treat suspects, didn't think
they knew what they were saying.

00:54.637 --> 00:57.140
Make sure you put them in separate cells.

00:59.392 --> 01:00.268
[scoffs]

01:02.562 --> 01:03.980
Do you understand?

01:04.064 --> 01:06.024
Because you don't look like you do.

01:08.651 --> 01:11.196
-[door alarm buzzes nearby]
-[inmates chattering]

01:11.780 --> 01:14.115
[inmate] Oh, shit. Look who it is!

01:14.199 --> 01:17.744
Man, yo! I'm about to make you my bitch,
pretty boy.

01:18.453 --> 01:19.954
[door alarm buzzes]

01:20.038 --> 01:21.331
[wolf whistle]

01:21.414 --> 01:23.416
[inmates continue chattering, hooting]

01:33.635 --> 01:35.970
[inmate 2] Hey, I'll see you in the yard!

01:36.054 --> 01:38.139
Fuck her. You guys are all in here.

01:48.566 --> 01:49.776
[keys clanking]

01:57.450 --> 02:00.787
-We gotta get our shit straight.
-[Pete] They don't got nothing on us.

02:00.870 --> 02:03.456
-They can't prove we did anything.
-Hey, fuck you!

02:04.332 --> 02:06.334
-This is on you! We ain't do shit!
-[Pete] Yeah?

02:06.417 --> 02:09.129
Well, you got rid
of that fucking grill guard off my car.

02:09.629 --> 02:10.755
That makes you an accessory.

02:10.839 --> 02:13.550
They're not gonna put us away,
we're fucking cops!

02:14.050 --> 02:16.803
The car's gone,
they're never gonna find it.

02:16.886 --> 02:19.055
-And we got alibis for that morning.
-"We"?

02:19.931 --> 02:20.765
Not me.

02:22.559 --> 02:24.894
You think I wouldn't find out
you left me off that report?

02:26.896 --> 02:29.899
-The fuck you talking about?
-He was gonna set me up to take the fall.

02:29.983 --> 02:32.735
That's crazy. Come on.
They can't even prove we were there.

02:32.819 --> 02:34.154
They got the witness.

02:35.405 --> 02:36.614
Yeah.

02:37.198 --> 02:38.867
Why you think we in here?

02:39.868 --> 02:40.952
Because of her.

02:48.251 --> 02:49.669
[indistinct chatter]

03:05.602 --> 03:08.396
[KJ] Sorry. Hi.
I have seats for us down here.

03:38.885 --> 03:39.844
[man] Murderers!

03:39.928 --> 03:42.347
[woman]
You're going down! Going down!

03:42.430 --> 03:45.266
[overlapping chatter, shouts]

03:51.731 --> 03:56.194
-[loud tapping]
-Remain seated. Court is now in session.

03:56.277 --> 03:58.738
The Honorable Steven Lafferty presiding.

03:58.821 --> 04:00.657
[chatter ceases]

04:08.539 --> 04:11.376
Case number 17-82439,

04:11.459 --> 04:14.337
the State of New Jersey
v. Michael DiAngelo,

04:14.420 --> 04:18.967
Emmanuel Gary Wilcox, Felix Osorio,
and Peter Jablonski.

04:19.968 --> 04:22.095
KJ Harper for the State, Your Honor.

04:22.512 --> 04:24.639
Barry Piumetti for the Defense,
Your Honor.

04:24.722 --> 04:27.558
Does the prosecution wish to be heard
on the issue of bail?

04:27.642 --> 04:28.768
Yes, Judge.

04:29.394 --> 04:34.190
The State asks that the defendants
be detained without bail pending trial.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.442
[overlapping chatter]

04:38.361 --> 04:43.116
Or alternatively held
on a $500,000 cash bail.

04:43.199 --> 04:45.743
-[loud chatter continues]
-Hold the noise down!

04:45.827 --> 04:48.579
Hold it down or you'll be ejected
from the courtroom.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.541
We have evidence connecting
one of the defendants

04:51.624 --> 04:54.210
to the vehicle
that very likely hit Brenton Butler.

04:55.628 --> 04:58.631
A witness places
the other three defendants at the scene.

05:00.383 --> 05:02.885
For this reason,
the State charges the defendants

05:02.969 --> 05:04.554
with aggravated manslaughter.

05:05.388 --> 05:09.434
A first-degree felony carrying
a maximum 20-year sentence.

05:09.517 --> 05:12.186
[loud overlapping chatter]

05:13.646 --> 05:14.731
[man] That's a joke!

05:18.818 --> 05:21.029
Guys, come on. I mean it.

05:21.112 --> 05:23.573
I can't let you disrupt
my judge's courtroom.

05:24.198 --> 05:26.909
Either you sit down or you leave.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.498
-Get out! Get out!
-Get out!

05:36.669 --> 05:38.212
[indistinct chatter continues]

05:52.810 --> 05:54.437
-[door shuts]
-Proceed.

05:55.730 --> 05:59.025
The seriousness of the crime charged
increases the chances that they'll flee.

05:59.358 --> 06:03.446
Additionally, defendant Jablonski
has already proved himself a flight risk.

06:08.159 --> 06:11.996
I'll set bail at $25,000 each,
cash or bond.

06:12.121 --> 06:13.790
-[overlapping protests]
-What?

06:14.540 --> 06:15.792
That ain't right!

06:16.209 --> 06:18.294
[man] No way! That's not justice!

06:18.878 --> 06:21.464
[bailiff] Settle down now!

06:22.006 --> 06:25.009
Your Honor, at least require a cash bail.

06:25.093 --> 06:27.220
Jablonski is a flight risk.

06:28.846 --> 06:30.848
Defendant Peter Jablonski is granted bail

06:30.932 --> 06:33.309
on the condition that he wear
a monitoring bracelet

06:33.392 --> 06:35.311
until the completion of the trial.

06:35.394 --> 06:36.437
[pounds gavel]

06:36.521 --> 06:37.480
Next case.

06:39.273 --> 06:42.026
Case number 17-82455,

06:42.110 --> 06:45.404
the State of New Jersey v. James Miller.

06:50.827 --> 06:52.954
My cousin Rusty got twice that bail
for burglary.

06:53.913 --> 06:56.499
The police kill Brenton
and they're on the way to their crib?

06:56.874 --> 06:59.669
-Some fucking bullshit.
-'Cause Brenton's life don't matter.

07:01.337 --> 07:03.297
He was nothing more
than a gangbanger to them.

07:03.381 --> 07:05.216
Brenton wasn't no Five King!

07:06.801 --> 07:07.969
What did you say?

07:10.221 --> 07:11.055
Hey.

07:12.849 --> 07:14.267
How'd he get that bike then?

07:18.855 --> 07:19.939
It was mine.

07:21.149 --> 07:22.358
Not Brenton's.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.028
What was he doing in the park?

07:30.283 --> 07:31.868
You better answer me, boy.

07:32.952 --> 07:34.537
What was Brenton doing there?

07:47.300 --> 07:48.968
Twenty years? Motherfucker!

07:49.051 --> 07:52.972
Look, I'm just General Counsel to
the National Association of Police, okay?

07:53.055 --> 07:54.891
I give advice, I make appearances.

07:54.974 --> 07:56.893
I've never handled a case
like this before.

07:57.351 --> 08:00.563
I'm not doing time behind bars
like a fucking animal, you understand me?

08:00.646 --> 08:02.607
You're getting new representation.

08:02.690 --> 08:06.027
Okay? Someone who has been to trial
multiple times.

08:06.110 --> 08:08.070
Sam Hennessy is a ballbuster.

08:08.154 --> 08:09.822
[door alarm buzzes, door opens]

08:10.490 --> 08:11.824
We were just talking about you.

08:20.500 --> 08:23.461
I'm Sam Hennessy.
Pleasure to finally meet you.

08:26.672 --> 08:28.674
[scoffs] Fuck me!

08:28.758 --> 08:31.385
[DiAngelo laughs]

08:32.345 --> 08:34.764
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, it's just, um...

08:36.224 --> 08:38.643
-I'm Mike DiAngelo.
-I know who you are.

08:39.268 --> 08:41.521
Half the fucking state knows who you are.

08:42.313 --> 08:43.481
That's the problem.

08:46.567 --> 08:48.861
Now that playtime's over,
I'm gonna need you to sign these

08:48.945 --> 08:50.905
if you agree to retain me
as your attorney.

08:50.988 --> 08:53.950
Fees will be paid
by the National Association of Police.

08:54.659 --> 08:55.826
Any questions?

08:56.285 --> 08:59.705
Only thing they got us on
is hindering an investigation, maybe...

09:00.957 --> 09:02.542
conspiracy to leave the scene.

09:02.625 --> 09:06.462
I see you've got it all figured out.
Shall I go ahead and leave now?

09:09.048 --> 09:11.551
From now on,
leave the legal arguments to me.

09:12.510 --> 09:15.972
None of what he says applies to me. Okay?
I was just riding in the back seat.

09:16.055 --> 09:18.349
Yeah, me, too.
I want my case tried separate.

09:18.432 --> 09:20.810
You want to go it alone?
Find your own attorney?

09:22.228 --> 09:23.271
There he is.

09:25.064 --> 09:27.608
Otherwise, you need to understand this.
It's simple.

09:27.692 --> 09:31.362
Alone, you're just an idiot
who got his hand caught down his pants.

09:31.821 --> 09:33.406
Together, you're cops.

09:33.489 --> 09:36.325
Together, they have to put
the entire police force on trial.

09:36.409 --> 09:39.704
And no jury ever convicts
the entire police force.

09:42.123 --> 09:43.416
So, you all on board?

09:46.711 --> 09:47.837
We're a team.

09:48.838 --> 09:51.173
-We do this together, right?
-[Osorio sighs]

09:51.257 --> 09:52.300
Yeah, okay.

09:52.883 --> 09:53.718
Yeah, sure.

09:53.801 --> 09:55.261
Good choice.

09:56.053 --> 09:57.638
Any other questions?

09:57.722 --> 09:59.473
What about the 20 years?

09:59.557 --> 10:03.519
My guess is this assistant prosecutor,
KJ whatever the fuck her name is,

10:03.603 --> 10:05.146
is overreaching.

10:05.229 --> 10:07.982
Typical ploy to scare the bad guys
and get them to plea out,

10:08.065 --> 10:09.275
you know how it goes.

10:09.358 --> 10:12.945
Now, I'm gonna need you to tell me
everything that happened that morning.

10:13.029 --> 10:14.030
Don't leave anything out.

10:16.032 --> 10:17.825
Also need those pens back when you're done

10:17.908 --> 10:19.994
so you don't turn them
into homemade shanks.

10:22.330 --> 10:23.331
[DiAngelo chuckles]

10:23.414 --> 10:27.793
If the grand jury hands down indictments
for manslaughter, we can revisit bail.

10:28.336 --> 10:30.254
I'm disappointed
we couldn't keep them locked up.

10:30.338 --> 10:32.423
-We need to talk to Howard.
-[Fish] Who?

10:32.757 --> 10:35.551
He's Jablonski's neighbor.
He lives across the street from him,

10:35.635 --> 10:37.803
and he knows things.
He knows about that blue car.

10:38.179 --> 10:39.889
And I can take you to his house

10:39.972 --> 10:41.974
-and make him tell me--
-You went to his house?

10:42.058 --> 10:44.352
That won't be necessary.
Hey, hey, that won't be necessary.

10:44.727 --> 10:45.853
I'll find this Howard.

10:45.936 --> 10:47.855
Then I probably should go back
to the hospital,

10:47.938 --> 10:50.024
because now we know
that Jablonski was there.

10:50.107 --> 10:52.234
Latrice, please.

10:57.782 --> 10:59.825
I have to prepare for a grand jury.

10:59.909 --> 11:03.579
We don't even get a trial
if the grand jury doesn't indict.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.915
And I need to put you on the stand.

11:06.582 --> 11:09.377
But right now,
you don't make a credible witness.

11:11.671 --> 11:14.590
Maybe you could talk to someone

11:14.673 --> 11:17.093
who understands
what you're going through.

11:19.678 --> 11:21.472
Can I ask where you're staying now?

11:23.182 --> 11:24.683
Are you still in that motel?

11:26.977 --> 11:28.104
I have a friend.

11:29.021 --> 11:30.439
And I can stay with her.

11:32.858 --> 11:35.152
I'll let you guys know
where you can reach me.

12:07.685 --> 12:09.812
[kids chattering indistinctly]

12:17.736 --> 12:20.322
[Messiah] Yo, yo, yo. He good, he good.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.243
[Seth] I won't be needing this.

12:25.661 --> 12:26.745
I say you do.

12:27.997 --> 12:30.416
That mission you went on
to put down Jablonski?

12:30.499 --> 12:32.084
It was sanctioned by a cop.

12:32.418 --> 12:34.503
His higher-up gave me the go-ahead.

12:34.587 --> 12:36.881
A cop green-lighting a hit on another cop

12:36.964 --> 12:40.426
sure as hell won't lose no sleep
killing your black ass.

12:43.262 --> 12:46.348
You knew from the get
the motherfuckers who killed my nephew?

12:47.224 --> 12:48.726
Look around you, man.

12:50.686 --> 12:54.857
Do you know how many motherfuckers eat
because of me?

12:56.400 --> 12:58.194
It's a delicate ecosystem.

12:59.069 --> 13:01.238
Certain alliances are necessary.

13:02.573 --> 13:05.117
I'm just playing the board
the way it's laid, bro.

13:06.452 --> 13:07.536
We all do.

13:16.045 --> 13:18.297
"Five to the sky till the day we die."

13:21.008 --> 13:22.134
[Seth] Mmm?

13:27.973 --> 13:29.642
This is where we part ways, bro.

13:37.608 --> 13:39.693
We can put them in the park.

13:39.777 --> 13:42.446
Their cell phones were pinging off
the closest tower.

13:42.530 --> 13:45.407
Jablonski was on the phone to DiAngelo
around the time of the accident.

13:45.491 --> 13:48.327
Which constitutes the reckless mens rea
for death by auto,

13:48.410 --> 13:49.828
not aggravated manslaughter.

13:51.539 --> 13:52.998
This is all circumstantial.

13:53.916 --> 13:55.543
-We have the witness.
-Who's a minor.

13:55.626 --> 13:57.670
How do her parents feel
about her testifying?

13:57.753 --> 13:59.421
They kicked her out a while ago.

13:59.505 --> 14:01.840
She's been under police protection since.

14:01.924 --> 14:03.717
I didn't see anything about that
in the file.

14:04.176 --> 14:05.386
We had to keep it need-to-know.

14:05.469 --> 14:07.805
Look at the nature
of who we're investigating.

14:08.097 --> 14:11.976
She's with Fish's ex-wife,
who's an NYPD cop, on Long Island.

14:12.059 --> 14:13.477
She is safe.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.105
They hired Sam Hennessy.

14:18.274 --> 14:19.233
Fine.

14:26.657 --> 14:27.533
Hey.

14:28.576 --> 14:29.535
Look at me.

14:33.247 --> 14:34.290
Are you okay?

14:43.757 --> 14:44.967
I am so sorry.

14:47.887 --> 14:50.598
-I hate that this happened.
-I just want to get on with this.

14:52.892 --> 14:53.893
She left.

14:55.227 --> 14:56.228
Took the kids.

15:07.656 --> 15:09.992
I wouldn't turn down a plea deal
if Hennessy offers.

15:10.075 --> 15:11.702
I'll have Jessie set up a meeting.

15:12.995 --> 15:14.121
Let me know how it goes.

15:19.251 --> 15:21.378
The PO's gonna want to know my address.

15:22.630 --> 15:25.174
They're gonna have to limit my movements
with the ankle bracelet.

15:25.257 --> 15:27.217
You can't come back to the house.

15:27.843 --> 15:29.345
Why didn't you leave?

15:29.970 --> 15:31.263
What were you thinking?

15:33.015 --> 15:34.683
I ain't a fucking coward.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.435
I'm sick of your secrets,

15:36.936 --> 15:39.647
I'm sick of being cut out of everything
in your life.

15:39.730 --> 15:41.899
-No, what are you talking about?
-Your past.

15:42.608 --> 15:45.110
This is about your dad, your childhood.

15:45.194 --> 15:48.280
You think I'm so weak
I can't handle the truth of things?

15:48.989 --> 15:50.908
Some things you don't need to know.

15:52.034 --> 15:55.120
That shit doesn't matter.
You know me better than anyone.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.039
Maybe.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.335
I know your heart,

16:02.378 --> 16:03.671
but not your life.

16:06.173 --> 16:07.675
What kind of marriage is that?

16:07.758 --> 16:10.552
[door opens, closes]

16:11.762 --> 16:14.848
[man] Gonna need you to put
your foot up on that to get this on.

16:14.932 --> 16:16.600
Yeah. I was just leaving.

16:19.687 --> 16:22.648
What we're witnessing here
is nothing more than a witch hunt

16:22.731 --> 16:24.858
against the Jersey City Police Department.

16:25.192 --> 16:27.361
It's one we've become accustomed to seeing

16:27.444 --> 16:31.699
in cities like Baltimore, Chicago,
New York... the list goes on.

16:32.074 --> 16:36.120
Every police officer in America is at risk
of becoming the next scapegoat

16:36.203 --> 16:40.249
for the racial ills of our society
and political correctness run amok.

16:40.708 --> 16:43.127
It's a shame and it's a sham.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.838
-Thank you.
-[camera shutters clicking]

16:45.921 --> 16:46.922
Thank you.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.424
[indistinct chatter]

16:49.174 --> 16:51.135
You've all been placed
on administrative leave.

16:51.218 --> 16:53.429
So stay home, keep a low profile.

16:54.513 --> 16:55.764
Yo, DiAngelo.

17:04.064 --> 17:05.774
I'm not visiting you in jail.

17:08.152 --> 17:11.405
Yo, man, if you want to get your story
on the record, I'll be fair to you, bro.

17:11.488 --> 17:13.115
I'm not your bro. Quit hassling me.

17:15.784 --> 17:16.869
[Luis sighs]

17:21.373 --> 17:22.458
[panting]

17:22.541 --> 17:24.793
I have to get up on the stand like on TV?

17:24.877 --> 17:27.796
[Fish] Forget whatever bullshit
you've seen on TV. Court is boring.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.506
People will barely be paying attention.

17:29.590 --> 17:31.633
We'll be lucky if the judge is even awake.

17:31.717 --> 17:33.969
No, don't do that. Don't do... Oh, Jesus.

17:34.053 --> 17:36.263
-I'm embarrassed for her.
-It's so she'll look cute.

17:36.346 --> 17:39.016
I gotta make her stand out
from all the other bitches.

17:39.099 --> 17:41.393
It's not a freaking Tinder profile.

17:42.227 --> 17:43.687
It's so she'll get adopted.

17:46.273 --> 17:47.775
Are you done thinking about it yet?

17:47.858 --> 17:49.985
I got seven dogs. I can't, I'm sorry.

17:50.069 --> 17:53.447
Oh, come on. That dog in Pampers
is gonna die any day now.

17:53.530 --> 17:55.032
It can't even move.

17:55.115 --> 17:58.368
I bet you're gonna see a lot of her
every day for a long time to come.

17:58.452 --> 18:01.038
She's gonna get adopted,
but probably not right away.

18:01.121 --> 18:02.998
This place is a fucking death camp.

18:04.124 --> 18:06.543
They give the dogs a couple weeks
to get adopted,

18:06.627 --> 18:08.670
and if they don't,
they gas them in the back.

18:10.005 --> 18:11.090
I saw the room.

18:12.382 --> 18:16.887
It's her personality that makes her cute,
but you can't see that in a picture.

18:17.888 --> 18:19.932
I'll take a picture of both of you,

18:20.015 --> 18:21.975
and then you'll have something
to remember her by.

18:22.059 --> 18:24.019
Because she's gonna get adopted
like tomorrow.

18:24.895 --> 18:25.938
Say cheese.

18:27.856 --> 18:28.899
Nadine.

18:30.359 --> 18:31.568
She's gonna be okay.

18:32.694 --> 18:33.654
Come on.

18:34.571 --> 18:36.406
There you go. Get in there.

18:36.490 --> 18:38.283
[chuckles] There we go.

18:38.367 --> 18:39.618
[camera clicking]

18:39.701 --> 18:40.702
Okay.

18:41.829 --> 18:42.788
See?

18:43.372 --> 18:46.500
I'll email that to you, and once you get
your phone and your internet back,

18:46.583 --> 18:49.336
you can use it as your wallpaper,
whatever, when all this is over.

18:51.547 --> 18:52.965
It's never gonna be over.

18:54.883 --> 18:56.802
[dog whimpers]

18:56.885 --> 19:01.682
I am so grateful to have found all of you.

19:01.765 --> 19:05.185
You know what it's like
to lose a child to violence.

19:05.269 --> 19:09.148
There's no explaining, no justifying.

19:09.940 --> 19:11.692
Just a lot of loving.

19:13.986 --> 19:15.070
Wes.

19:15.529 --> 19:16.822
You wanting to share?

19:18.282 --> 19:19.616
[Wes] Thanks, Ellie.

19:20.742 --> 19:22.119
So today, um...

19:24.246 --> 19:25.414
I woke up.

19:28.834 --> 19:30.836
And I heard Andrew's laugh.

19:32.838 --> 19:37.593
I know I share how quiet my son was,
but...

19:38.385 --> 19:39.845
that laugh...

19:41.096 --> 19:43.682
I don't even know where that came from,
you know.

19:44.391 --> 19:48.437
He had one of them contagious joints,
you know what I mean? Like...

19:49.104 --> 19:52.149
The next thing you know, you're laughing.
You don't even know why.

19:55.277 --> 19:57.863
I remembered it this morning.

19:59.281 --> 20:03.785
Made me think I'm the luckiest man
living on this earth...

20:04.328 --> 20:06.163
that I heard my son's laugh.

20:08.123 --> 20:09.625
[Wes chuckles]

20:09.708 --> 20:11.460
Yeah.

20:12.586 --> 20:15.172
Ms. Butler, you see how we do?

20:15.255 --> 20:17.674
You want to--
You want to share something?

20:19.801 --> 20:20.928
Oh, um...

20:22.512 --> 20:24.056
I don't know what to say.

20:29.937 --> 20:31.480
I saw the man that...

20:32.356 --> 20:33.857
that murdered my son.

20:34.650 --> 20:35.943
And he was...

20:38.403 --> 20:39.988
He wouldn't say it, he...

20:40.447 --> 20:41.990
He wouldn't say what he did.

20:42.783 --> 20:43.909
And I, uh...

20:44.910 --> 20:45.953
Now I...

20:49.039 --> 20:50.457
I don't know what to do.

20:50.540 --> 20:52.042
I just-- I feel...

20:52.834 --> 20:54.544
like I'm losing my mind.

20:54.628 --> 20:56.546
I feel like, um...

20:58.465 --> 21:00.926
like I don't know who I am.
I'm-- I'm just...

21:01.760 --> 21:06.348
I just don't know what to do anymore.
And I'm just really angry, and I...

21:07.683 --> 21:11.103
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I need to go.
-[chair clatters]

21:21.321 --> 21:22.489
Excuse me.

21:22.572 --> 21:25.284
-I have someplace I got to be.
-No, no, this-- this you, right?

21:30.122 --> 21:30.956
Thank you.

21:31.331 --> 21:32.374
No problem.

21:32.916 --> 21:33.917
Hey, listen.

21:35.294 --> 21:38.338
All I had was anger, for years.

21:38.964 --> 21:42.259
And it fueled me, gave me purpose.

21:42.884 --> 21:44.261
I didn't want to let that go.

21:44.344 --> 21:49.224
I felt like maybe I'm giving up on my son
or betraying him.

21:51.018 --> 21:52.311
It's all I got.

21:53.228 --> 21:56.148
I don't want to feel anything else.

21:58.066 --> 22:01.987
You know what?
Six days out of seven are good.

22:03.947 --> 22:05.449
It does get better.

22:08.035 --> 22:10.829
Your son, when did he...

22:10.912 --> 22:12.122
Ten years ago.

22:12.873 --> 22:15.042
And last month was the anniversary.

22:15.792 --> 22:16.877
Listen, just...

22:18.128 --> 22:19.880
just keep coming back, all right?

22:21.506 --> 22:22.674
Just holler at me.

22:23.175 --> 22:25.927
Look, we're just here for each other,
that's all. All right?

22:26.011 --> 22:30.182
So, ain't no shame, pick up the phone
if you want to, you know,

22:30.265 --> 22:32.184
cry, you want to rage.

22:32.267 --> 22:35.145
You know, you want to talk
about the weather. Whatever.

22:35.812 --> 22:36.813
All right?

22:39.483 --> 22:40.942
Take care of yourself.

22:51.286 --> 22:52.120
[doorbell rings]

23:00.587 --> 23:01.880
Yo, Seth here?

23:02.506 --> 23:03.924
He ain't been on the corner.

23:04.299 --> 23:06.551
No, I haven't seen him.

23:11.431 --> 23:13.016
Mind if I see Brenton's room?

23:59.479 --> 24:01.064
I used to tease him.

24:02.023 --> 24:05.652
Called him "rich boy"
because he had his own room.

24:08.238 --> 24:11.533
Me and my brother and my sister
shared a room when we was young.

24:21.585 --> 24:25.505
There was a seagull in the spokes
of my bike.

24:27.215 --> 24:29.092
You think maybe I could get it back?

24:29.718 --> 24:31.052
Police got your bike.

24:31.970 --> 24:33.597
It's part of the investigation.

24:35.807 --> 24:38.018
I'll see what I can do when they done.

24:39.895 --> 24:41.229
Yeah, okay. Thanks.

24:47.527 --> 24:50.280
Why was Brenton riding your bike
in the park that morning?

24:55.285 --> 24:56.494
Please.

24:56.870 --> 24:59.331
I need to know why this happened
to my son.

25:02.876 --> 25:06.046
He was using my bike
to get through the park.

25:06.755 --> 25:08.256
It was the fastest way home.

25:09.299 --> 25:11.635
He didn't want y'all to know
he was out all night.

25:15.889 --> 25:17.182
Brenton was...

25:18.850 --> 25:21.102
He was with me
the night before he got hit.

25:34.699 --> 25:36.243
He spent the night with me.

25:43.708 --> 25:45.043
You and Brenton?

25:58.306 --> 25:59.391
No.

26:00.642 --> 26:02.269
[scoffs]

26:02.352 --> 26:04.145
Nah. No.

26:06.106 --> 26:08.441
Brenton wasn't like that.
I didn't raise him that way.

26:08.525 --> 26:10.110
This ain't got nothing to do with you!

26:11.736 --> 26:14.698
When we was little,
they beat down Fernie Johnson.

26:16.616 --> 26:17.617
Remember that?

26:19.828 --> 26:22.789
I'll never forget the smell
of shit and blood coming off of him.

26:22.872 --> 26:26.668
They had him laid out on the block
with his pants down to his ankles.

26:27.961 --> 26:29.421
People wanted everybody to see it.

26:32.966 --> 26:34.551
I just remember his eyes.

26:38.555 --> 26:40.307
I protected Brenton.

26:42.058 --> 26:45.895
I was slanging to save up money
so we could get out of here.

26:48.565 --> 26:49.858
So we could be free.

26:56.197 --> 26:58.283
Boys like us don't make it out of here.

27:08.043 --> 27:09.961
Brenton made that seagull for me.

27:11.963 --> 27:13.173
I want it back.

27:16.843 --> 27:17.802
Get out.

27:20.430 --> 27:21.514
What did you say?

27:22.057 --> 27:23.475
I said get out!

27:24.267 --> 27:25.268
-Get out!
-Get the--

27:25.352 --> 27:26.561
Get out!

27:27.479 --> 27:29.230
Get out! Get out!

27:32.150 --> 27:33.026
[grunting]

27:36.237 --> 27:38.198
[breathing heavily]

27:47.791 --> 27:49.084
[breathing heavily]

28:07.936 --> 28:09.229
-[piano playing]
-[low chatter]

28:09.312 --> 28:10.980
[waitress] All right, here we are.

28:23.451 --> 28:27.122
-[Sam] KJ. Great to finally meet you.
-Yeah.

28:28.498 --> 28:31.251
So, what does "KJ" stand for?

28:32.669 --> 28:33.545
KJ.

28:35.296 --> 28:36.423
It's a rush, right?

28:36.923 --> 28:41.177
Walking into a room,
they expect to see "KJ" or "Sam,"

28:41.928 --> 28:42.929
and it's us.

28:44.347 --> 28:46.307
No better "fuck you" than that.

28:49.227 --> 28:51.813
I was going to reach out to you,
but you beat me to it.

28:52.230 --> 28:55.984
-It was my boss, not me.
-You'd rather go straight into the ring.

28:57.152 --> 29:00.989
You can take the girl out of Jersey City,
but not the JC out of the girl.

29:01.072 --> 29:02.157
[chuckles]

29:02.240 --> 29:04.534
-I'm from West Bergen.
-I'm from Brookdale.

29:05.952 --> 29:09.164
The difference is nobody knows
you're from Jersey City, but me?

29:10.290 --> 29:13.251
They always assume I'm from the hood,
even though I'm not.

29:14.711 --> 29:15.712
Let's get to it.

29:15.795 --> 29:17.088
What are you offering?

29:17.172 --> 29:20.008
You have a circumstantial case at best.

29:20.759 --> 29:23.261
I'm sure I can get my clients
to plead to hindering

29:23.344 --> 29:26.097
-and maybe assault by auto for Jablonski.
-[laughs]

29:26.890 --> 29:29.184
How about we just agree on jaywalking?

29:29.851 --> 29:31.519
They'd get more time for that.

29:32.312 --> 29:35.106
You can't even prove my client
was driving that car.

29:35.774 --> 29:41.112
With my offer, you'll get your conviction,
you'll be a hero without the bullshit.

29:41.196 --> 29:42.447
A kid died.

29:43.740 --> 29:44.908
You call that bullshit?

29:45.366 --> 29:48.495
-A gang member died.
-The press is wrong about Brenton Butler.

29:48.578 --> 29:49.662
Who cares?

29:50.538 --> 29:52.957
All that matters
is what the jury believes.

29:53.583 --> 29:56.461
You were in that courtroom.
It's only going to get worse.

29:57.629 --> 30:00.548
The cops will stop cooperating
on your cases,

30:00.632 --> 30:03.134
which means your boss
stops getting convictions.

30:03.885 --> 30:06.638
Last I heard,
Connelly's poll numbers were falling.

30:07.806 --> 30:10.475
Your case must be weak
if you have to threaten a plea out of me.

30:10.558 --> 30:12.060
I'm simply stating the facts.

30:12.519 --> 30:15.396
Whether you choose to accept them as such
is your choice.

30:16.147 --> 30:20.360
The police don't tolerate the prosecution
of one of their own. Ever.

30:21.236 --> 30:23.863
A lot of cops think the law
doesn't apply to them.

30:23.947 --> 30:26.825
But let me assure you, it does.

30:28.076 --> 30:29.536
Would you like a drink?

30:29.953 --> 30:32.497
My boozing days are over for good,
but feel free.

30:33.581 --> 30:34.749
I'm fine with water.

30:36.209 --> 30:38.795
Yeah, I used to match the boys
bourbon for bourbon.

30:39.045 --> 30:41.297
Woodford, that was my poison.

30:43.174 --> 30:45.635
I hear yours is Bombay Sapphire.

30:48.137 --> 30:51.140

No one sin is any greater than any other.

44:34.713 --> 44:36.298
But still, it's sin.

44:37.091 --> 44:38.008
Maybe.

44:38.384 --> 44:41.512
Or maybe God, in his infinite wisdom,

44:42.096 --> 44:45.599
made your son exactly
what he wanted him to be.

44:45.933 --> 44:47.768
Hey, where's that in the Book, Pastor?

44:50.521 --> 44:52.856
Is God gonna forgive Brenton
for what he was?

44:53.524 --> 44:56.193
I know what is in the Book, Isaiah.

44:56.276 --> 44:57.611
The real question is...

44:59.530 --> 45:01.115
can <i>you</i> forgive?

45:34.106 --> 45:35.274
Good afternoon.

45:35.357 --> 45:37.151
-Go ahead.
-Have your tickets ready.

45:37.234 --> 45:39.611
[people chatter indistinctly]

45:45.784 --> 45:48.745
So this is what you do all day long,

45:48.829 --> 45:50.581
go back and forth across the river?

45:51.665 --> 45:54.835
The address was on the card, so...

45:56.962 --> 45:59.089
I wouldn't have it any other way.

45:59.173 --> 46:00.757
Being out there on the water.

46:02.050 --> 46:04.094
The best views are up top though.

46:04.178 --> 46:05.596
It's cold down here.

46:06.388 --> 46:07.890
It gets even colder up there.

46:09.725 --> 46:11.894
Let me show you.
Save you some money too.

46:13.979 --> 46:15.981
[seagulls squawking]

46:16.273 --> 46:18.776
[boat horn blows]

46:20.486 --> 46:21.737
It's good to see you.

46:22.488 --> 46:24.448
I didn't think I was gonna hear from you.

46:25.991 --> 46:29.995
Yeah, I just... I don't know what to do
with myself. It's like...

46:31.288 --> 46:33.624
[sighs] My son's case...

46:34.875 --> 46:36.585
The waiting is the hardest part.

46:40.005 --> 46:41.215
Yeah, it is.

46:45.177 --> 46:46.970
Can I ask you something?

46:47.054 --> 46:48.555
How did Andrew die?

46:56.438 --> 46:59.024
He went into a 7-Eleven.

46:59.107 --> 47:00.734
These dudes were sticking it up.

47:01.818 --> 47:02.861
They shot him.

47:04.404 --> 47:07.032
He just went in for a soda and a snack.

47:10.786 --> 47:13.413
I didn't mean to bring up anything
that you'd rather not talk about.

47:13.497 --> 47:17.334
It's all right. I just... I don't really
think about it too much, you know.

47:24.007 --> 47:27.636
I still need to think about Brenton
every minute of every day. I...

47:29.930 --> 47:31.682
I don't want to do anything else.

47:34.017 --> 47:36.687
I think about my son
every minute of every day,

47:37.104 --> 47:40.023
but I just try to remember how he lived.

47:46.488 --> 47:48.115
It's beautiful out here, ain't it?

47:48.782 --> 47:50.200
Even when it's cold.

47:56.373 --> 47:59.001
[boat horn blows in distance]

48:04.756 --> 48:06.216
[ambient music playing]

48:09.720 --> 48:10.554
Thank you.

48:23.025 --> 48:24.901
Yo. Yo.

48:33.493 --> 48:36.163
Yeah, I once waited three days
for my number to be called,

48:36.246 --> 48:37.664
so I knew you'd be back.

48:37.748 --> 48:38.957
Saved a seat for you.

48:39.041 --> 48:40.000
Thanks.

48:44.421 --> 48:45.756
[watch beeping]

48:48.675 --> 48:49.593
Um...

48:50.469 --> 48:52.179
-Could you save my--
-Yeah. Yeah.

49:06.777 --> 49:07.694
[door closes]

49:18.580 --> 49:19.414
[door closes]

49:26.380 --> 49:27.881
[muffled speaking in Arabic]

49:33.804 --> 49:34.930
[praying]

49:45.899 --> 49:47.734
-Would you like to pray?
-Nah, I'm good.

49:47.818 --> 49:49.444
[Khalil] You are good, brother.

49:50.028 --> 49:51.071
You don't know that.

49:52.072 --> 49:53.782
You don't know shit about me, son.

49:55.200 --> 49:57.452
Two days ago, I almost killed a nigga.

49:58.245 --> 50:01.707
I had a gun in one pocket
and a photo of my nephew in the other.

50:02.082 --> 50:03.166
When time came...

50:07.546 --> 50:10.465
When time came, I took the photo out
instead of the gun.

50:14.261 --> 50:15.679
I don't know what happened.

50:18.849 --> 50:19.850
I don't know what...

50:22.352 --> 50:24.020
stopped me from killing that man.

50:28.066 --> 50:29.735
Maybe it was Allah, brother.

50:30.235 --> 50:32.362
He only wants peace for us in the end.

50:49.796 --> 50:52.507
You need to get the fuck out of here
with this bullshit, man.

51:02.142 --> 51:04.019
Yo, can you pass me my jacket?

51:19.326 --> 51:21.745
Do you recognize this man?

51:24.998 --> 51:27.083
Nadine, look at the photo.

51:30.545 --> 51:31.505
[KJ sighs]

51:32.005 --> 51:33.924
Gotta be more convincing than that.

51:34.925 --> 51:38.762
Grand jury's in a couple hours.
Come on, snap out of it.

51:40.138 --> 51:42.474
I already told you,
he looks like the asshole

51:42.557 --> 51:44.434
I saw stealing my shit
from the power plant.

51:44.518 --> 51:46.311
Looks like him or is him?

51:46.394 --> 51:48.063
It is him, okay? Fuck! Whatever.

51:49.689 --> 51:54.402
And in your witness statement, you said
the same man followed you to the diner

51:54.486 --> 51:56.279
on Jefferson Avenue and later--

51:56.363 --> 51:58.949
You know, you're such a fucking
lying asshole. You know that?

51:59.533 --> 52:01.451
If I can come here,
why can't I see Whiskey?

52:01.535 --> 52:05.080
I'm gonna be straight with you.
This is all on you, kid.

52:05.789 --> 52:10.126
If you don't testify,
the three of them are gonna go free.

52:11.127 --> 52:12.337
And why should I care?

52:13.088 --> 52:15.715
You don't give a shit about me,
leaving me in that fucking hellhole.

52:15.799 --> 52:19.052
That fucking hellhole is saving your life.

52:20.512 --> 52:22.222
They came at you.

52:23.223 --> 52:24.808
They came to your home.

52:25.475 --> 52:26.393
Think about that.

52:28.812 --> 52:33.733
They're not gonna stop
until you put them away.

52:34.609 --> 52:37.696
Your testimony to the grand jury tomorrow,
and if we're lucky, at trial,

52:37.779 --> 52:38.905
it's all we got.

52:40.198 --> 52:42.284
I wish it was different, I swear to God.

52:43.577 --> 52:44.828
But it is what it is.

52:51.543 --> 52:54.087
-He was the one that followed me.
-Okay, good.

52:57.716 --> 52:59.634
And he looked in the ditch.

53:02.804 --> 53:04.598
What do you mean, looked in the ditch?

53:05.974 --> 53:08.518
Nadine, you said all you saw
were three cops

53:08.602 --> 53:10.729
-get in their car and drive away.
-He looked, okay?

53:10.812 --> 53:11.980
They all looked!

53:13.523 --> 53:17.277
The cop with the baseball cap
threw the bike in and they all looked.

53:17.360 --> 53:20.488
And I should've too
because that kid would be alive if I had!

53:21.114 --> 53:22.741
I'm gonna prepare a new witness statement.

53:22.824 --> 53:23.742
Yeah.

53:28.330 --> 53:29.372
I'm sorry.

53:30.332 --> 53:31.166
No.

53:34.628 --> 53:38.340
-I was just too scared to look.
-It's okay, it's okay. Hey, it's okay.

53:39.299 --> 53:41.468
Don't worry. Don't worry, it's okay.

53:42.886 --> 53:47.349
The grand jury just handed down
a true bill for aggravated manslaughter.

53:48.058 --> 53:51.228
-All four defendants were indicted.
-[Fish] Did really good. Gonna be fine.

53:53.563 --> 53:55.899
Thanks to a new piece of evidence
provided by a witness,

53:55.982 --> 53:57.984
we're going into trial
with a very strong case.

53:58.526 --> 54:00.570
-Thank you.
-Can you give us the name of the witness?

54:00.654 --> 54:03.740
[Connelly] The identity of the witness
cannot be revealed at this point,

54:03.823 --> 54:05.784
but the witness
will be testifying at trial.

54:05.867 --> 54:07.327
-[woman] When?
-Needless to say...

54:07.410 --> 54:09.204
[KJ] You ready to make
a serious offer now?

54:09.287 --> 54:12.332
I wouldn't get too confident.
You had no opponent in there.

54:12.415 --> 54:13.458
Maybe not,

54:14.209 --> 54:16.419
but I also don't have to defend
four guilty men.

54:16.503 --> 54:19.714
-That's for the court to decide.
-What? No plea bargain?

54:20.799 --> 54:23.093
Assault by auto will always
be on the table.

54:24.678 --> 54:28.014
[Connelly] We have a long record
of listening to our citizens' concerns

54:28.098 --> 54:29.516
and acting on them.

54:29.599 --> 54:31.059
We'll continue to do so.

54:36.022 --> 54:40.235
When I asked you for a detailed account

54:40.652 --> 54:42.278
of what transpired that morning,

54:42.362 --> 54:45.240
somehow climbing to the top of the ditch,

54:45.949 --> 54:49.202
looking down at the victim, and then
making the decision to walk away,

54:49.285 --> 54:52.205
just, I don't know, slipped your minds?

54:52.622 --> 54:55.291
Well, I guess it's time to earn your keep,
Counselor.

54:56.960 --> 54:58.294
I thought he was dead.

54:59.004 --> 55:02.173
The amount of blood in that ditch,
the head wound...

55:02.674 --> 55:04.092
We all thought he was dead.

55:05.343 --> 55:08.304
-State of mind, that is a mitigating fac--
-Shut up.

55:09.472 --> 55:11.599
You think I need to be educated on the law

55:11.683 --> 55:14.227
by some cop
with a community college degree?

55:15.812 --> 55:18.732
Let me explain
an aggravating factor to you.

55:18.815 --> 55:22.569
As cops,
you've got this little obligation.

55:22.652 --> 55:24.112
It's called Duty of Care.

55:24.654 --> 55:28.575
Which means once you, all of you,
looked into that ditch,

55:28.658 --> 55:30.994
you are obligated
to notify the authorities.

55:31.077 --> 55:33.580
-They gotta prove that though.
-They have a witness!

55:35.790 --> 55:38.543
And she's gonna hang you
when we go to trial.

55:38.835 --> 55:40.587
What kind of time are we looking at?

55:41.463 --> 55:42.714
[Sam] Oh, I don't know.

55:44.299 --> 55:45.425
Twenty years.

55:46.551 --> 55:49.679
[Wilcox] Fucking Jablonski.
He's the cause of all this!

55:49.763 --> 55:52.515
He drove off that day,
he left us holding the bag.

55:58.438 --> 56:01.107
-You should've told me about the witness.
-What would you have done?

56:01.191 --> 56:03.359
Not taken the fucking case.

56:04.402 --> 56:08.531
If I thought that kid was alive,
I would've never walked away.

56:11.201 --> 56:12.702
That's the fucking truth.

56:15.455 --> 56:17.957
Welcome to the criminal justice system,
gentlemen.

56:19.167 --> 56:21.127
No one gives a fuck about the truth.

56:28.968 --> 56:30.553
[baby cooing]

56:33.098 --> 56:35.183
I thought you had to go see your lawyer.

56:38.061 --> 56:39.646
No, this is more important.

56:40.772 --> 56:42.649
I finished painting over the garage.

56:43.066 --> 56:48.822
I put dead bolts on all the doors
and security locks on the windows.

56:52.408 --> 56:53.910
These are the new keys.

56:54.744 --> 56:55.829
I'm gonna go.

57:08.675 --> 57:10.593
You want to know about my childhood?

57:13.972 --> 57:15.515
I hated my mother.

57:16.182 --> 57:17.934
I hated him worse. But her?

57:18.893 --> 57:20.103
She was weak.

57:22.856 --> 57:24.774
Couldn't stand up for herself.

57:27.402 --> 57:31.156
I'd hear him whaling on her, and she...
she's screaming.

57:33.074 --> 57:34.576
I never did nothing.

57:37.787 --> 57:41.583
Never stopped him, never...
never called the cops.

57:43.626 --> 57:45.253
I just stayed in my room.

57:47.380 --> 57:49.507
Hid in the closet like a fucking coward.

57:54.220 --> 57:55.305
[Pete sobs softly]

57:58.016 --> 57:58.933
I just...

58:00.435 --> 58:02.854
I just wanted to be
a different person for you.

58:03.521 --> 58:04.856
You know, and for Mikey.

58:10.320 --> 58:14.073
Face this thing... like a man.

58:17.619 --> 58:18.578
[sniffles]

58:19.537 --> 58:20.622
[Marie] Petey.

58:30.048 --> 58:31.591
You can stay on the couch.

59:02.830 --> 59:04.165
[dogs barking]

59:06.417 --> 59:07.794
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

59:10.922 --> 59:13.633
Hey. Hey, it's okay.
It's okay, Whiskey. I got you.

59:13.716 --> 59:15.635
Nothing's gonna happen to you, okay?

59:15.802 --> 59:17.470
Okay. You're okay.

59:31.401 --> 59:32.944
[Nadine] No! Get off me!

59:33.027 --> 59:34.237
[Nadine grunting]

59:34.320 --> 59:36.447
-Let me go!

Hey.

59:51.296 --> 59:52.171
Hey.

59:53.047 --> 59:54.257
[kissing]

59:55.049 --> 59:56.342
You lost?

[whimpering, gasping]

1:00:50.647 --> 1:00:51.731
[whispers] Get out.

1:00:51.814 --> 1:00:53.316
No. No.

1:00:56.402 --> 1:00:59.155
-[DiAngelo] Get the fuck out. Get out!
-No, no, no, no! [gasping]

1:01:06.621 --> 1:01:08.373
-[gasping] Please.
-[Wilcox] Relax.

1:01:08.456 --> 1:01:09.582
Please, please. I...

1:01:10.333 --> 1:01:12.752
I won't-- I won't tell anybody. I promise.

1:01:12.835 --> 1:01:14.545
I won't say anything, okay?

1:01:14.629 --> 1:01:18.216
I'll run away and nobody will find me,
okay? No one. I promise!

1:01:18.299 --> 1:01:19.175
[birds squawking]

1:01:19.258 --> 1:01:21.219
[whimpers, screams]

1:01:21.302 --> 1:01:22.887
-Hey! Hey, hey, hey!
-No! No! No!

1:01:22.970 --> 1:01:24.639
-Get her on the fucking ground!
-No!

1:01:24.722 --> 1:01:28.351
Get off of me! Get off! Please!

1:01:28.434 --> 1:01:29.727
Please don't hurt me! Please!

1:01:29.811 --> 1:01:32.939
-Hey, shut your fucking mouth! Shut up!
-Stop screaming!

-[muffled shrieks]
-Stop fucking screaming! Stop screaming.

1:01:35.483 --> 1:01:37.568
[muffled sobbing, wailing]

1:01:37.860 --> 1:01:39.696
Please. [whispers] Stop screaming.

1:01:40.697 --> 1:01:42.448
-Let's go, Mike.
-Come on, do it.

1:01:42.532 --> 1:01:45.118
I just want to go home.
I won't say anything.

1:01:45.201 --> 1:01:47.120
