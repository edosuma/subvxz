that his promotion was
affirmative action nonsense.

gonna do about it?

with just my word
against theirs.

00:12.346 --> 00:13.314

would never stick.

hard evidence.

Hi, Mom.

there's a real problem
with your liver?

You don't have
to worry about that.

my mom today.

to get what she wants.

00:46.447 --> 00:48.216
Which is what?
My liver, apparently.

to throw away everything

00:51.552 --> 00:53.821
I didn't ask him
for anything.

I thought I drained
the oil all out the pan.

And the oil filter?

01:41.669 --> 01:43.704
Oh. Yo.

01:43.837 --> 01:46.207
I'd say you're looking
fresh, kid, but that oil
looks anything but.

that my way is working.

02:36.557 --> 02:38.626
You said
you'd be a silent partner,

02:38.759 --> 02:41.929
and you wanted Darryl
to pick his own path.

02:42.062 --> 02:43.964
And he chose this.
That's why I'm so invested.

02:44.097 --> 02:47.435

it's finally starting
to come along,

03:18.366 --> 03:21.034
He will not be fired
from the L.A.P.D.

03:21.168 --> 03:23.036
Same for the other two,
Gibson and Ellis.

03:23.170 --> 03:24.705
They'll all be placed

of testimony that
Deacon gave the board?

03:31.679 --> 03:32.980
Sir, he's been
catching flak

03:33.113 --> 03:34.782
from other officers for
turning that tape in.

03:34.915 --> 03:35.883
What, it's all
just for nothing?

03:36.016 --> 03:37.184
No, the recording
carried weight.

03:37.318 --> 03:38.786
It prompted I.A.'s
integrity check

03:38.919 --> 03:40.421
on Durham
and the other officers.

03:40.554 --> 03:42.856

03:42.990 --> 03:45.025
no tangible evidence that
racism influenced their work.

03:45.158 --> 03:46.159
Yeah. Why would it?

03:46.294 --> 03:47.861

their arrest records?

03:47.995 --> 03:49.963

have all worked with officers
of color with no incident.

one missing shooter,

10:34.134 --> 10:35.969
two possible victims
in the wind.

10:36.103 --> 10:37.637
Odds are
the trafficking victims

10:37.771 --> 10:39.873
will be transported
within 48 hours,

10:40.007 --> 10:41.842
assuming the traffickers
don't kill them instead.

10:41.975 --> 10:45.045
We need to find out
how this ring operates
and who runs it, fast.

10:45.178 --> 10:46.714
The victim's name
is Shannon Gamble.

10:46.847 --> 10:47.881
Currently in our custody.

10:48.015 --> 10:49.649
The dead male suspect
is Paul Temple.

10:49.783 --> 10:51.985
The other male suspect
is Gabriel Cardenas.

10:52.119 --> 10:54.454
He's in surgery.
He's an interstate trucker
from Nevada.

10:54.587 --> 10:57.290
Misdemeanors for disorderly
conduct and drug possession,

10:57.424 --> 10:59.592
but no known ties to
Paul Temple or the ring.

10:59.727 --> 11:01.094
He's probably the john.

11:01.228 --> 11:02.830
Truckers are on the road
300 days a year.

11:02.963 --> 11:04.798
Many get lonely enough
to pay for affection.

11:04.932 --> 11:06.099
Anything else on Shannon?

11:06.233 --> 11:07.434
Nineteen years old.

11:07.567 --> 11:09.837
She's originally from Reno.
Rough upbringing.

11:09.970 --> 11:12.505
Spent some time in juvie,
couple arrests
for misdemeanors.

11:12.639 --> 11:14.274
It looks like she cycled
through the foster system,

11:14.407 --> 11:16.243
then in and out of rehabs
around the state

11:16.376 --> 11:17.845
till she fell off the grid
two years ago.

11:17.978 --> 11:19.479
With that background,
she'd be a perfect target
for...

11:19.612 --> 11:20.814
Romeo Pimps. Yeah.

11:20.948 --> 11:22.515
HICKS: If Shannon can
tell us who recruited her,

11:22.649 --> 11:24.617
it could help bring
this ring into focus,
lead us to find more victims.

11:24.752 --> 11:26.686
That may not be easy.

11:26.820 --> 11:29.122
Sex trafficking victims
often fear the cops

11:29.256 --> 11:30.824
and stay loyal
to their captors.

11:30.958 --> 11:32.459
Very loyal.

11:32.592 --> 11:34.461
I still remember
the questioning techniques
we used in Vice.

11:34.594 --> 11:35.896
Maybe I can help you
get Shannon to open up.

11:36.029 --> 11:37.364
All right, make it happen.

11:37.497 --> 11:39.132
Meantime, Deacon and Chris
are gonna talk to Gabriel

11:39.266 --> 11:40.600
once he gets out of surgery.

11:45.372 --> 11:48.008
Hey. When were
you gonna tell me?

11:48.141 --> 11:49.476
Tell you what?

11:49.609 --> 11:51.544
That you went to see my mom
about the liver donation.

11:51.678 --> 11:53.480
I just warned her
not to mess up
your life again.

11:53.613 --> 11:54.782
I guess it didn't work.

11:54.915 --> 11:56.116
You shouldn't have done that.
It's not your business.

11:56.249 --> 11:58.151
It's a major surgery.

11:58.285 --> 11:59.552
It can have its
complications.

11:59.686 --> 12:02.155
Infections, blood clots,
pneumonia.

12:02.289 --> 12:04.557
I'm aware.
What's your point?

12:04.691 --> 12:07.527
It can put
your career at risk,
maybe even your life.

12:07.660 --> 12:10.530
She's just manipulating
you into getting her way,
like always.

12:10.663 --> 12:12.665
I know what she's doing,
but it's my choice to make,

12:12.800 --> 12:15.035
not yours.
I need you to respect that.

12:18.605 --> 12:20.340
(QUIET CHATTER)

12:23.010 --> 12:25.879
Shannon. My name's
Lieutenant Piper Lynch.

12:26.013 --> 12:27.815
And this is
Officer Victor Tan.

12:27.948 --> 12:29.149
Am I under arrest?

12:29.282 --> 12:30.317
TAN: No.

12:30.450 --> 12:31.684
We just want to talk,
if that's okay.

12:31.819 --> 12:33.020
These are for you.

12:34.054 --> 12:35.055
I know it's a bit
stuffy in here.

12:35.188 --> 12:36.356
We can walk outside,
if you prefer.

12:36.489 --> 12:38.058
I want to go home.

12:40.193 --> 12:41.194
To Reno?

12:44.631 --> 12:45.765
Was Paul Temple
the person

12:45.899 --> 12:47.300
who brought you down here
from there?

12:47.434 --> 12:49.269
LYNCH: We believe
that Paul was part
of a trafficking operation,

12:49.402 --> 12:51.171
and that you were
one of his victims.

12:51.304 --> 12:52.840
(SCOFFS SOFTLY)

12:52.973 --> 12:53.874
Did he recruit you?

12:54.875 --> 12:56.844
No. Paul's a friend.

12:56.977 --> 12:58.711
Not many friends
force you to have sex

12:58.846 --> 13:00.013
with strangers
against your will.

13:02.282 --> 13:04.117
TAN: Paul's dead, Shannon.

13:04.251 --> 13:05.618
I normally wouldn't be
this blunt,

13:05.752 --> 13:07.254
but we don't want
the other two girls

13:07.387 --> 13:08.956
to end up like him.
We could use your help.

13:09.089 --> 13:10.423
The-the other girls...

13:11.724 --> 13:13.760
They're-they're going
to get hurt now

13:13.894 --> 13:14.761
because I ran away.

13:14.895 --> 13:16.729
It's all my fault.

13:16.864 --> 13:19.399
Can you tell us anything
about where they might be?

13:19.532 --> 13:20.767
How we can find them?
No.

13:20.901 --> 13:22.069
We moved around a lot.

13:22.202 --> 13:23.636
I-I didn't even know
where I was

13:23.770 --> 13:26.006
until I saw "L.A.P.D."
on your uniforms.

13:26.139 --> 13:27.174
What about the men
who worked with Paul?

13:27.307 --> 13:29.242
I-I don't know much.

13:32.245 --> 13:33.246
But...

13:34.481 --> 13:36.416
There's this guy
named "JC."

13:36.549 --> 13:38.151
Was he the one
who recruited you?

13:43.090 --> 13:44.257
What else can you
tell us about him?

13:47.961 --> 13:49.762
DEACON: Gabriel Cardenas?

13:49.897 --> 13:52.132
I'm Sergeant Kay,
this is Officer Alonso.
L.A.P.D. S.W.A.T.

13:52.265 --> 13:53.633
How is the girl?

13:53.766 --> 13:55.268
Unharmed...
Physically, at least.

13:55.402 --> 13:56.269
Good.

13:58.005 --> 14:00.307
It wasn't supposed
to go down that way.

14:00.440 --> 14:01.841
How was it supposed
to go down, exactly?

14:01.975 --> 14:03.643
You pay her to
service you,

14:03.776 --> 14:05.545
then you move on
to the next truck stop,

14:05.678 --> 14:06.646
the next girl?

14:06.779 --> 14:07.981
Whoa, I'm-I'm not
the bad guy here.

14:09.116 --> 14:10.283
I was trying to save her.

14:11.451 --> 14:12.652
I'm sorry.
Do you know this girl?

14:14.187 --> 14:15.688
Then how do you know
she needed saving?

14:15.822 --> 14:17.290
You know the signs
to look for.

14:18.225 --> 14:19.626
I'm with
Long Haul Protectors.

14:19.759 --> 14:21.628
I've got the
certification card
in my wallet, right there,

14:21.761 --> 14:23.763
if you need proof.
Long Haul Protectors?

14:23.897 --> 14:26.399
Yeah. We're a
national group working
to-to stop human trafficking.

14:26.533 --> 14:27.867
There-there are more
of us truckers

14:28.001 --> 14:29.169
on the road
than you cops,

14:29.302 --> 14:30.603
so we do what
we can to help out.
By what?

14:30.737 --> 14:33.040
Staging reenactments
of the shootout
at the O.K. Corral?

14:33.173 --> 14:34.641
I made a mistake, I know,
but those cabrones,

14:34.774 --> 14:36.009
they came out
guns blazing.

14:36.143 --> 14:37.577
I shot back in self-defense.

14:37.710 --> 14:38.845
CHRIS: Anything else
you can tell us

14:38.979 --> 14:40.880
about the shooter
or the victims?
Yeah.

14:41.014 --> 14:42.849
The girls' names.

14:42.983 --> 14:44.584
Before they drove off,
the-the shooters,

14:44.717 --> 14:47.020
they-they called out
for "Rosetta" and "Monica."

14:47.820 --> 14:48.956
All right, thank you.

14:50.223 --> 14:51.224
I was just trying to help.

14:53.326 --> 14:56.129
Just because you want
to help doesn't mean
it'll make things better.

14:56.263 --> 14:57.330
Next time, call the cops.

14:58.698 --> 15:01.268
Hey. I heard Shannon gave us
the name of her recruiter.

15:01.401 --> 15:02.669
JC Walker.

15:02.802 --> 15:05.038
Record for possession,
larceny, aggravated assault.

15:05.172 --> 15:06.906
Luca's getting a last known
for the bastard now.

15:07.040 --> 15:07.774
Wait a minute.

15:09.242 --> 15:11.344
You seem awfully fired up.

15:11.478 --> 15:14.247
Shannon's like this girl
I knew in high school...
Becca.

15:14.381 --> 15:17.550
She got lured in, trafficked
by a Romeo Pimp, too.

15:17.684 --> 15:19.752
She's a big part of why
I jumped onto Vice
when I had the chance.

15:19.886 --> 15:21.354
I'm guessing Becca
wasn't just "some girl."

15:22.389 --> 15:24.091
All right, when Luca
gets that address,

15:24.224 --> 15:25.258
we'll roll out.

15:30.330 --> 15:31.764
I didn't know y'all
were coming through.

15:31.898 --> 15:33.500
Well, the young fella
said it was urgent.

15:33.633 --> 15:35.368
So, uh, apparently,
I'm just the chauffeur.

15:36.469 --> 15:39.606
I, uh... I needed
to drop this off.

15:43.410 --> 15:44.711
What the hell is this?

15:44.844 --> 15:46.146
It's the money you invested
into the auto shop.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.348
Well, some of it.

15:48.481 --> 15:50.383
I got five grand now,
and the rest as soon
as I can get it.

15:50.517 --> 15:52.585
Darryl, how the hell
did you come up with
five large all of a sudden?

15:52.719 --> 15:54.554
Did Leroy give you this
and send you to me?

15:54.687 --> 15:56.189
He said you'd say that.

15:56.923 --> 15:57.924
You knew about this?

15:58.058 --> 15:59.926
If I knew
he had that kind of cash,

16:00.060 --> 16:01.461
I'd have got him
to spring for gas.

16:01.594 --> 16:03.963
Look, the money's clean,
I promise.

16:04.097 --> 16:05.765
It's everything we earned
from the auto shop so far.

16:05.898 --> 16:07.667
Neither one of us
is taking a paycheck

16:07.800 --> 16:09.402
until we pay you back
the full 25 grand.

16:11.638 --> 16:12.905
You keep that
for the shop.

16:13.040 --> 16:14.041
I don't need it
back right away.

16:14.174 --> 16:15.075
No. I need you
to take it back.

16:16.876 --> 16:17.677
It's a buyout.

16:19.046 --> 16:20.780
Listen, I appreciate
everything you've done.

16:20.913 --> 16:23.150
But my dad's right.

16:23.283 --> 16:26.419
I got to be my own man,
stand on my own two feet.

16:31.058 --> 16:32.292
Just think it over.

16:32.425 --> 16:33.426
Please.

16:37.297 --> 16:39.599
Well, you did encourage
the boy to be independent.

16:39.732 --> 16:41.301
Now's not the time, Pop.

16:41.434 --> 16:44.604
Is there any reason
that he wouldn't want you
to come by his new business?

16:44.737 --> 16:47.507
Hey. Got an address for
our recruiter in Reseda.
Team's gearing up now.

16:47.640 --> 16:48.741
I'll be right there, Luca.
Okay.

16:50.210 --> 16:51.978
Take it home.
I got to go.

16:52.112 --> 16:53.446
Definitely more
on this later.

16:58.651 --> 16:59.852
STREET: JC Walker.

16:59.986 --> 17:00.887
L.A.P.D. S.W.A.T.

17:02.489 --> 17:03.656
(GRUNTS)

17:06.593 --> 17:08.261
(PANTING)

17:09.396 --> 17:10.397
(GRUNTS)

17:10.530 --> 17:11.964
Deacon, Street,
stay on him!

17:12.099 --> 17:13.466
Tan, you're with me!
Let's move!

17:19.472 --> 17:20.473
(GRUNTING)

17:24.911 --> 17:25.745
(GRUNTS)

17:27.114 --> 17:28.515
(GRUNTING)

17:33.320 --> 17:34.487
(GRUNTS)

17:39.492 --> 17:40.493
(SIGHS)

17:43.663 --> 17:45.898
Nice to see almighty S.W.A.T.
can do some grunt work
now and then.

17:47.834 --> 17:49.402
Have we met?
No.

17:50.503 --> 17:51.638
But I know you.

17:51.771 --> 17:53.406
Officer Kay, right?

17:59.146 --> 18:00.713
It's Sergeant Kay.

18:00.847 --> 18:02.915
Oh, yeah.
I heard about you.

18:03.049 --> 18:05.552
You go around taping fellow
officers in your free time,

18:05.685 --> 18:07.154
and then report
on them, right?

18:07.287 --> 18:09.088
Guess you're gonna
have to turn us both in
now, too, huh?

18:09.222 --> 18:10.823
How about
conduct unbecoming?

18:10.957 --> 18:13.693
Or neglect of duty...
Officer Mitchell.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.198
Billings, right?

18:18.331 --> 18:19.632
Glad I'm so memorable.

18:19.766 --> 18:20.867
Not in the good way.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.735
Hondo, I got this.

18:26.139 --> 18:27.507
Officer Mitchell,

18:27.640 --> 18:29.409
take that suspect
down to S.W.A.T. HQ.

18:29.542 --> 18:30.710
Now.

18:35.515 --> 18:37.684
I guess I'll get started
on the investigation.

18:37.817 --> 18:39.186
Probably a lot of
damage to sort out.

18:45.225 --> 18:46.559
Listen, Deacon...
It's fine.

18:57.237 --> 18:59.439
I never met this
Paul Temple guy in person.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.441
I swear.

19:01.574 --> 19:02.975
What about the girls
he trafficked?

19:03.876 --> 19:04.844
Trafficked?

19:04.977 --> 19:06.613
I got a witness who says
you recruited her.

19:07.414 --> 19:08.548
(SCOFFS) Who?

19:08.681 --> 19:10.783
Shannon? (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

19:10.917 --> 19:12.785
Try the other way around.
She recruited me.

19:12.919 --> 19:15.188
She hit me up
on social media,
and we flirted a bit.

19:15.322 --> 19:17.590
She was cute, and I'd just
gotten out of a breakup.

19:18.258 --> 19:19.526
You were a john.

19:19.659 --> 19:21.861
I guess,
but she approached me.

19:21.994 --> 19:24.130
Yeah. That's because
she was forced to.

19:24.264 --> 19:25.698
She seemed eager enough.

19:25.832 --> 19:27.934
Yeah, well, consent's
not really an option
for trafficking victims.

19:28.067 --> 19:29.769
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
A hooker wearing
different lipstick

19:29.902 --> 19:30.870
is still a hooker.

19:31.003 --> 19:32.439
They're not hookers,
they're hostages.

19:32.572 --> 19:33.940
Girls like Shannon
get abducted

19:34.073 --> 19:35.375
and forced to turn tricks.

19:35.508 --> 19:36.843
And if they don't service
ten guys a day,

19:36.976 --> 19:38.645
their pimps would beat 'em
within an inch of their life.

19:38.778 --> 19:39.846
Does that sound
like "eager" to you?

19:39.979 --> 19:41.214
CHRIS: And just so
you're crystal clear,

19:41.348 --> 19:45.252
solicitation is a misdemeanor,
but trafficking is a felony,

19:45.385 --> 19:47.287
and it comes with a hefty
prison sentence.

19:47.420 --> 19:49.722

19:49.856 --> 19:51.491
This is where you
start talking till
we tell you to stop.

19:51.624 --> 19:54.193
(SIGHS)

19:54.327 --> 19:56.629
Uh, Paul coordinated
everything online,
so I never met him.

19:56.763 --> 19:58.331
I paid through Venmo,

19:58.465 --> 20:00.600
and he sent an Uber
to bring me back and forth.
Where?

20:00.733 --> 20:02.001
I never got the address,

20:02.134 --> 20:03.903
but I think it's somewhere
in Sun Valley.

20:06.306 --> 20:07.307
(DOOR OPENS)

20:08.775 --> 20:09.642
(DOOR CLOSES)

20:14.414 --> 20:17.317
Chris and Tan got JC Walker
to cough up a location
for the missing girls.

20:17.450 --> 20:18.651
Good.

20:19.586 --> 20:20.887
I'll take any progress
right now.

20:27.527 --> 20:31.163
You know, I can handle
blowback from jerks like
Mitchell and Billings.

20:31.298 --> 20:33.433
(EXHALES)
It just sucks.

20:33.566 --> 20:36.068
Everything we did,
nothing came of it.

20:38.004 --> 20:38.838
I know.

20:40.307 --> 20:43.242
Deacon, I've been saying it.
The system needs to change.

20:43.376 --> 20:44.644
But if it's not gonna
change on its own,

20:44.777 --> 20:45.878
then maybe
we need to force it.

20:46.479 --> 20:47.480
How do you mean?

20:48.815 --> 20:50.517
Maybe we got
one last card we can play.

20:50.650 --> 20:52.051
Hey, I did
everything I could.

20:53.553 --> 20:54.854
What more do you
want me to do?

20:54.987 --> 20:56.489
Not you, man.

20:56.623 --> 20:57.590
You've done enough.

20:58.491 --> 20:59.592
Talking about me.

21:02.462 --> 21:03.663
I don't like
the sound of that.

21:03.796 --> 21:05.698
You know
how bureaucracy works,

21:05.832 --> 21:07.434
how slow things move
in the L.A.P.D.

21:07.567 --> 21:09.436
Nothing's gonna change
without outside pressure.

21:09.569 --> 21:11.871
But if Durham's actions
are made public,

21:12.004 --> 21:13.606
maybe we can force
the department's hand.

21:13.740 --> 21:14.874
You talking
about going to the press?

21:16.343 --> 21:17.377
No.

21:17.510 --> 21:19.011
No, no. No way in hell.

21:20.347 --> 21:21.781
You will get it ten times
worse than me out there.

21:21.914 --> 21:23.282
Do you see
any other option?

21:23.416 --> 21:25.485
Yeah. We take a hard look
at-at S.W.A.T.'s
recruiting methods.

21:25.618 --> 21:27.420
We revise them
if we have to.

21:27.554 --> 21:29.021
And we spot
the next Durham
a mile away.

21:29.155 --> 21:30.390
There shouldn't be
a next Durham, Deacon.

21:31.824 --> 21:32.925
We're just supposed
to let the union

21:33.059 --> 21:35.495
leave these guys
out on the street?

21:35.628 --> 21:38.297
It's not your family
that officers like Durham
and his buddies target.

21:38.431 --> 21:39.231
It's...
I know.

21:42.034 --> 21:44.571
But what
you are talking about
is career suicide.

21:51.978 --> 21:55.482
Hey. I got your message.
Why would Shannon lie
about JC being her recruiter?

21:55.615 --> 21:57.650
Some of these girls get
so psychologically scarred,

21:57.784 --> 21:59.719
they'll feed cops fake intel
to cover for their handlers.

21:59.852 --> 22:01.654
Now, the more abusive
the handlers...

22:01.788 --> 22:04.090
Trauma caused by physical
and emotional abuse,

22:04.223 --> 22:06.626
it's-it's...
It's hard to explain.
It's like a vicious cycle.

22:06.759 --> 22:08.361
It makes people
do strange things.

22:08.495 --> 22:11.431
And these creeps like JC
are why trafficking exists
in the first place.

22:11.564 --> 22:12.932
Supply and demand.

22:13.065 --> 22:14.567
I don't know how
you break that cycle.
Yeah, me, neither.

22:14.701 --> 22:16.836
But I'll sleep better
if we can help
these girls escape it.

22:16.969 --> 22:18.004
We all will.

22:18.137 --> 22:19.606
LUCA: There are dozens
of social media profiles

22:19.739 --> 22:20.940
affiliated with
Paul Temple's account,

22:21.073 --> 22:23.876
but only six were active
within the last month.

22:24.010 --> 22:25.478
So there's six girls
in this trafficking ring.

22:25.612 --> 22:27.279
And five of them must
still be in the wind,
being used.

22:27.414 --> 22:29.348
Rosetta, Monica, Dani,
Julie and Laura.

22:34.587 --> 22:35.922
We arrested JC.

22:36.055 --> 22:37.256
We know he's not the
one who recruited you.

22:37.390 --> 22:38.458
(DOOR CLOSES)

22:39.792 --> 22:41.160
But he won't be able
to use you again.

22:44.130 --> 22:47.266
Lying only makes it harder
for us to help you.

22:47.400 --> 22:49.536
Especially when there
are five other girls
who need our help.

22:49.669 --> 22:50.703
Your help.

22:57.343 --> 22:59.011
I knew a girl
in high school.

22:59.145 --> 23:00.880
Her name was
Becca Matonik.

23:01.013 --> 23:03.149
She was
my first big crush.

23:03.282 --> 23:04.717
And she had everything
going for her.

23:04.851 --> 23:07.720
And a few weeks
after I-I got up the courage

23:07.854 --> 23:09.722
to ask her out,
she disappeared.

23:11.290 --> 23:12.992
We found out later
she'd been abducted
and trafficked.

23:15.862 --> 23:17.997
Her friends and family
never saw her again
until it was...

23:18.130 --> 23:18.998
It was pretty bad.

23:20.967 --> 23:22.835
I don't want Becca's story
to be your story, Shannon.

23:23.836 --> 23:24.837
Please.

23:28.307 --> 23:30.843
I hated when
JC came around.

23:32.278 --> 23:33.546
He was cruel

23:34.481 --> 23:36.549
and very rough.

23:39.385 --> 23:40.953
Sorry for lying.

23:41.087 --> 23:42.755
Can you tell us about
where you and the
other girls were kept?

23:42.889 --> 23:44.857
It was at Barry's place.

23:44.991 --> 23:46.759
Barry was the other shooter
at the truck stop?
They ran the ring?

23:46.893 --> 23:50.429
Paul, Barry and,
uh, one other guy.

23:50.563 --> 23:53.666
I-I never heard his name,
but he had a real bad temper.

23:54.901 --> 23:57.804
There was this
old rusty birdhouse

23:57.937 --> 23:59.606
outside my window
at that place.

23:59.739 --> 24:01.240
When things got bad,

24:01.373 --> 24:04.043
I always looked out
the window at the birds.

24:07.580 --> 24:08.715
But they weren't there.

24:10.883 --> 24:12.485
What do you mean?

24:12.619 --> 24:16.155
That thing outside
wasn't a real birdhouse,
so there weren't any birds.

24:17.590 --> 24:22.294
But pretending there were
helped me.

24:22.428 --> 24:24.897
Anything was better
than being in that room.
TAN: This birdhouse.

24:25.031 --> 24:26.298
What did it
look like, exactly?

24:28.067 --> 24:29.602
The birdhouse Shannon
saw outside her window

24:29.736 --> 24:31.303
is actually a decommissioned
Cold War siren.

24:31.437 --> 24:32.805
This map shows
all of them in L.A.

24:32.939 --> 24:34.306
Maybe we can use it
to find the location

24:34.440 --> 24:35.542
where the girls
are being kept.

24:35.675 --> 24:37.243
That's gonna be tough.

24:37.376 --> 24:39.546
From the looks of it,
there's more of these sirens
than Starbucks in town.

24:39.679 --> 24:42.515
JC said the Uber
took him somewhere
in Sun Valley.

24:42.649 --> 24:45.451
Two of those sirens
are in the Sun Valley
manufacturing corridor.

24:45.585 --> 24:47.086
That's all warehouses
and factories.

24:47.219 --> 24:48.821
Third one's
in a residential area.

on that block.

be the brothel.

JC paid into

27:14.767 --> 27:17.036
had a second email
associated with it,

Also suspected in the murder
of two 20-year-old women
in Barstow.

27:28.915 --> 27:30.482

believed to be part

of a different

up in San Jose.

27:32.351 --> 27:34.586

killed those victims
to cover his tracks,
