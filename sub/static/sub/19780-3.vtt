WEBVTT

00:02.255 --> 00:04.125
*** is blue.

00:04.175 --> 00:06.676
Red. Blue.

00:06.678 --> 00:07.944
You can drive them around.

00:07.946 --> 00:09.711
Vroom!

00:09.713 --> 00:10.712
Vroom!

00:10.714 --> 00:11.746
Vroom!

00:11.748 --> 00:13.582
Vroom, vroom!

00:15.000 --> 00:21.074

00:24.194 --> 00:26.494
Should we go answer the door?

00:26.496 --> 00:27.228
Yeah.

00:27.897 --> 00:28.929
It's Auntie Maggie!

00:28.931 --> 00:30.731
Ready for your birthday breakfast?

00:30.733 --> 00:32.133
You know what, Mags?

00:32.134 --> 00:33.568
That was... that was really,
really, really kind of you,

00:33.570 --> 00:34.868
but you shouldn't have bothered.

00:34.870 --> 00:36.036
Oh, right... I forgot

00:36.038 --> 00:37.705
you're one of those anti-birthday people.

00:37.707 --> 00:38.872
Maybe. Kinda.

00:38.874 --> 00:43.143
Well, waffles à la Maggie
aren't really optional.

00:43.145 --> 00:43.978
Ta-da!

00:45.781 --> 00:47.681
Mmm, just like my mom used to make,

00:47.683 --> 00:49.282
or like I used to make for myself

00:49.284 --> 00:50.751
because she was still asleep.

00:50.753 --> 00:52.252
Somebody has to help you

00:52.254 --> 00:54.121
shake that negative birthday attitude, Reid.

00:54.123 --> 00:55.623
It's supposed to be a celebration.

00:55.625 --> 00:58.425
Hmm. Historically, hasn't
been the best day for me.

00:58.427 --> 01:00.760
And now with Luke, birthdays are for him.

01:00.762 --> 01:02.329
I remember you and Charlie

01:02.331 --> 01:04.797
always having these
crazy fancy birthday plans.

01:04.799 --> 01:07.567
It made him happy spoiling me.

01:07.569 --> 01:09.536
Any second thoughts?

01:09.538 --> 01:11.371
No. No second thoughts.

01:11.373 --> 01:12.839
Actually, I don't see him very much.

01:12.841 --> 01:15.842
He comes and visits Luke
when the nanny's here.

01:15.844 --> 01:18.011
Ohh, sorry.

01:18.013 --> 01:20.446
Sorry I'm late, Dr. Reid.

01:20.448 --> 01:22.548
My friend's deejay night
went super late again.

01:22.550 --> 01:24.416
Gorgeous flowers. Who are those from?

01:24.418 --> 01:27.053
A card says "Dana."

01:27.055 --> 01:28.287
Boy Dana or girl Dana?

01:28.289 --> 01:30.156
Maybe I could stop having a birthday.

01:30.158 --> 01:31.323
Or you could just tolerate the fact

01:31.325 --> 01:32.558
that it's a 24-hour period

01:32.560 --> 01:33.859
where the people who love you

01:33.861 --> 01:35.461
can treat you extra special.

01:35.463 --> 01:36.795
Do you mind if I use your shower

01:36.797 --> 01:38.130
when Luke goes down for his nap?

01:38.132 --> 01:39.965
Sure. Knock yourself out.

01:39.967 --> 01:40.966
Oh, thank you.

01:40.968 --> 01:42.601
Is she new?

01:42.603 --> 01:46.004
Ooh. You gonna finish that?

01:50.477 --> 01:51.843
No, no, not at all.

01:51.845 --> 01:53.444
I mean, I think it's actually
kind of strangely sexy.

01:53.446 --> 01:55.280
You think my CPAP machine is sexy?

01:55.282 --> 01:57.382
Sort of sci-fi sexy, like I'm sleeping

01:57.384 --> 01:59.818
next to a hot android
that needs to recharge.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.053
Such a liar.

02:01.055 --> 02:02.453
But it is more sexy

02:02.455 --> 02:03.722
than listening to me snore all night.

02:03.724 --> 02:05.590
It is nice to sleep again, yes.

02:05.592 --> 02:07.492
But even if I never slept again,

02:07.494 --> 02:09.160
it's all worth it.

02:09.162 --> 02:10.995
So, I've been thinking.

02:10.997 --> 02:12.197
Uh-oh.

02:12.199 --> 02:15.433
Nothing good has ever come from those words.

02:15.435 --> 02:17.335
You've been at my place a lot.

02:17.337 --> 02:18.002
Too much?

02:18.004 --> 02:21.138
No, not at all.

02:21.140 --> 02:23.107
You would save a lot of time and money

02:23.109 --> 02:25.676
if you got rid of your place.

02:25.678 --> 02:27.644
You could buy a car that didn't smell

02:27.646 --> 02:29.479
like it had a thousand juice boxes

02:29.481 --> 02:30.547
that exploded in it.

02:30.549 --> 02:31.982
Move in with me.

02:34.887 --> 02:36.020
No, I'm...

02:36.022 --> 02:38.222
No, no, no, no. Y...

02:38.224 --> 02:40.757
Yeah.

02:40.759 --> 02:41.925
Yes?

02:41.927 --> 02:43.893
Yeah.

02:43.895 --> 02:45.295
Let's do it.

02:48.767 --> 02:50.701
It'll be great.

02:54.639 --> 02:55.571
Dr. Miller!

02:55.573 --> 02:56.773
Jesus!

02:56.775 --> 02:58.908
I have a problem... lice.

02:58.910 --> 03:00.043
You've got lice?

03:00.045 --> 03:01.244
No, no.

03:01.246 --> 03:03.913
I was checking bed 5 for
concussion, and I saw them.

03:03.915 --> 03:05.348
I think one tried to jump on me.

03:05.350 --> 03:06.883
Okay, and you're distressed about this?

03:06.885 --> 03:08.417
Yeah, I-I have a thing about parasites,

03:08.419 --> 03:09.652
you know, crawly things.

03:09.654 --> 03:10.786
Dev one time had bed bugs,

03:10.788 --> 03:12.388
and I had to incinerate all my clothes.

03:12.390 --> 03:14.223
Oh, God,
what if I'm already infested?

03:14.225 --> 03:15.324
I could shave your head if you'd like.

03:15.326 --> 03:17.260
No, thanks, Supercuts.

03:17.262 --> 03:18.361
Incoming.

03:18.363 --> 03:20.162
Dr. Miller,
please take the lice lady.

03:20.164 --> 03:22.298
- Please.
- You're gonna see a lot worse than lice

03:22.300 --> 03:23.966
during your residency in the E.R., okay?

03:23.968 --> 03:25.735
I went through
14 pairs of shoes last year.

03:25.737 --> 03:27.069
I can't do it! I can't!

03:27.071 --> 03:29.537
Look, I will take whatever comes
through that door next.

03:29.539 --> 03:31.406
Just please don't make me go back there.

03:31.408 --> 03:33.375
Are you sure about that?

03:33.377 --> 03:34.542
Do we have a deal?

03:34.544 --> 03:36.511
Yeah. I guess we have a deal.

03:36.513 --> 03:37.780
En route from the airport,

03:37.782 --> 03:40.115
brother and sister being
airlifted out of Malawi.

03:40.117 --> 03:41.349
You better brush up

03:41.351 --> 03:43.985
on your tropical infections and parasites.

03:43.987 --> 03:45.987
Seriously, take
a really good look at that.

03:45.989 --> 03:47.889
I'm so excited for you.

03:53.463 --> 03:54.763
Happy birthday, Alex!

03:54.765 --> 03:58.566
Hey, uh, uh, thank you, Shahir.

03:58.568 --> 03:59.567
But, actually, it's not my birthday.

03:59.569 --> 04:00.634
Yes, it is.

04:00.636 --> 04:02.536
My birthday calendar reminders are flawless.

04:02.538 --> 04:04.172
Okay, it was. It's just not anymore.

04:04.174 --> 04:06.507
I don't feel like having
a birthday, so I'm skipping it.

04:06.509 --> 04:09.277
Oh. Well, I got you a gift.
Should I return it?

04:09.279 --> 04:10.678
No, no,
you don't have to return it.

04:10.680 --> 04:11.946
That was very thoughtful of you.

04:11.948 --> 04:12.847
I'll return it.

04:15.484 --> 04:16.416
How's the wing doing?

04:16.418 --> 04:17.451
Not bad. Comes and goes.

04:17.452 --> 04:18.851
I need to get back in the O.R.

04:18.853 --> 04:20.187
I'm sick of riding the pine.

04:20.189 --> 04:22.255
You, uh, talk to Alex today?

04:22.257 --> 04:23.890
Yes, I know it's her birthday, Dana.

04:23.892 --> 04:26.193
And my gift to her is all
the space she's asked me for.

04:26.195 --> 04:27.761
- You want to talk about it?
- Nope.

04:27.763 --> 04:29.296
- Fair enough.
- How's trauma treating you?

04:29.298 --> 04:30.731
Mm. Like a doormat.

04:30.733 --> 04:33.266
I'm really hoping today's gonna
be a slower day for once.

04:34.436 --> 04:37.304
Dana, may I borrow you for two secs?

04:39.274 --> 04:41.007
You have a mischievous glint, Lin.

04:41.009 --> 04:43.509
So, I know Alex hates her birthday.

04:43.511 --> 04:44.711
Right.

04:44.713 --> 04:45.846
She's still kind of in a funk

04:45.848 --> 04:46.980
about the whole Charlie breakup thing.

04:46.982 --> 04:48.281
Kind of hard to miss.

04:48.283 --> 04:50.717
I think her friends should be proactive,

04:50.719 --> 04:51.818
take back her birthday.

04:51.820 --> 04:53.720
It's all about bad memories, right?

04:53.722 --> 04:55.822
So we give her some new ones, good ones,

04:55.824 --> 04:58.458
by throwing her a surprise party tonight.

04:58.460 --> 05:00.693
And you're sure this is what
she's gonna want right now?

05:00.695 --> 05:04.096
I'm sure.
Spread the word, but quietly.

05:04.098 --> 05:05.898
The key to my longevity at this hospital...

05:05.900 --> 05:07.032
I can keep a secret.

05:07.034 --> 05:08.734
Perfect.

05:08.736 --> 05:09.935
Garth Blackmore, 32,

05:09.937 --> 05:12.104
fell through the floor
of an abandoned house.

05:12.106 --> 05:14.106
Medics suspect a spinal fracture

05:14.108 --> 05:16.641
in addition to the more obvious issue here.

05:16.643 --> 05:18.810
Mr. Blackmore, can you wiggle
your big toe for me, please?

05:18.812 --> 05:20.179
I can't.

05:20.181 --> 05:21.646
So, uh, what made you

05:21.648 --> 05:23.382
- want to walk around an abandoned building, sir?
- My job.

05:23.384 --> 05:25.884
Place is supposed to be haunted
by the ghost of a young boy.

05:25.886 --> 05:27.652
- Pressure's good.
- Running a F.A.S.T.

05:28.756 --> 05:29.821
Can you feel this?

05:29.823 --> 05:31.723
Sort of. It's tingly, though.

05:31.725 --> 05:33.525
So, you're into haunted houses?

05:33.527 --> 05:36.661
I write books and blog about
paranormally tainted properties.

05:36.663 --> 05:38.730
Sometimes a homeowner brings me
in to assess a situation.

05:38.732 --> 05:39.730
A situation?

05:39.732 --> 05:40.899
What's that, like, slamming doors

05:40.901 --> 05:42.133
and floating entities over your bed?

05:42.135 --> 05:44.068
Usually, it's noisy pipes,

05:44.118 --> 05:46.556
overactive imaginations, mental illness.

05:46.606 --> 05:48.706
Yeah, I thought I saw a ghost once in a B&B.

05:48.756 --> 05:49.807
I screamed like hell.

05:49.857 --> 05:51.794
Turned out the owner was a peeping Tom.

05:51.844 --> 05:53.044
Cross and type him.

05:53.046 --> 05:54.645
We're gonna need
a lot of blood on standby.

05:54.647 --> 05:56.447
So, tell me, Garth, did you see the ghost?

05:56.449 --> 05:58.749
Take it from an expert.
There's no such thing as ghosts.

06:18.089 --> 06:19.321
How's the pain, Garth?

06:19.323 --> 06:21.423
My back hurts more than the...

06:21.425 --> 06:23.492
this, which I really, really
want you to take out

06:23.494 --> 06:25.227
- like right now.
- F.A.S.T. is challenging,

06:25.229 --> 06:26.996
but I'm not seeing anything alarming yet.

06:26.998 --> 06:29.165
You're very lucky.
Missed all the vital organs.

06:29.167 --> 06:30.366
The tingling's getting worse.

06:30.416 --> 06:31.302
I got to tell you

06:31.352 --> 06:32.984
this is the first time I've
ever worked on a ghostbuster.

06:33.034 --> 06:35.271
A ghostbuster fights ghosts.
I prove they don't exist.

06:35.273 --> 06:36.872
Dr. Kinney, a quick word.

06:36.874 --> 06:39.941
He's hemodynamically stable,
so that buys us some time.

06:39.943 --> 06:41.577
Yeah, but we need to
rule out a progressive
neurological deficit.

06:41.579 --> 06:43.479
- So impending paralysis.
- Yeah.

06:43.481 --> 06:45.013
But the more immediate threat
is the massive internal bleed,

06:45.015 --> 06:46.182
so we need to rule that out first.

06:46.184 --> 06:47.416
We're gonna have an imaging problem.

06:47.418 --> 06:49.017
We can't get him into the MRI
with the impalement,

06:49.019 --> 06:50.285
and if there's a nail in that wood...

06:50.287 --> 06:51.720
Yeah, the magnetism will shred his insides.

06:51.722 --> 06:53.822
- So, portable C.T.?
- Sounds good. Let's do it.

06:53.824 --> 06:55.290
Let's move him, guys. Let's go.

06:57.161 --> 06:58.727
Leo and Anna Timblin.

06:58.729 --> 07:01.129
Welcome home. We've been expecting you.

07:01.131 --> 07:02.798
Oh, we're home?

07:02.800 --> 07:04.465
Oh, Anna, we're home.

07:04.467 --> 07:06.568
So, we've received some files from Lilongwe,

07:06.570 --> 07:08.269
and there's no fear for contagion,

07:08.271 --> 07:11.138
but the doctors there suspected malaria,

07:11.140 --> 07:14.209
dysentery, hep "A," and larval infestations.

07:14.211 --> 07:15.743
I can feel things moving in my feet.

07:15.745 --> 07:17.712
Great. Okay.

07:17.714 --> 07:19.046
Uh, you guys were airlifted

07:19.048 --> 07:21.148
before all of the test results were back,

07:21.150 --> 07:23.217
but we should be receiving them shortly.

07:23.219 --> 07:25.720
You know, maybe you could take
them into the isolation room

07:25.722 --> 07:27.188
and just give them a once-over.

07:27.190 --> 07:28.589
I have to go to the bathroom.

07:28.591 --> 07:30.424
- Is it an emergency?
- Like, now. Like, right now.

07:30.426 --> 07:32.093
Yeah, good idea. Go with her.

07:32.095 --> 07:34.628
Maybe get a, uh, stool culture
while you're in there.

07:34.630 --> 07:35.996
No time like the present.

07:37.633 --> 07:39.966
My dad's been here for 34 minutes.

07:39.968 --> 07:41.000
He's in agony.

07:41.002 --> 07:42.902
But I see you had time to get a coffee,

07:42.904 --> 07:44.504
so I guess that's nice for you.

07:44.506 --> 07:46.640
Well, my shift starts at 10:00,

07:46.642 --> 07:49.710
which is actually, hmm,
a minute away, but okay.

07:49.712 --> 07:51.044
Let's see how your dad is.

07:51.046 --> 07:53.747
Dion. Don't worry about Aisha.

07:53.749 --> 07:55.449
She's so used to bossing me around,

07:55.451 --> 07:56.950
she thinks she can do it to everyone.

07:56.952 --> 07:58.317
You know what?

07:58.319 --> 08:00.720
She'd make an excellent
chief of surgery someday.

08:00.722 --> 08:01.988
I'm Dr. Reid.

08:01.990 --> 08:03.990
I hear that you're having
a sickle cell crisis.

08:03.992 --> 08:05.491
You must be in a lot of pain.

08:05.493 --> 08:07.426
Misshapen cells
are blocking his capillaries,

08:07.428 --> 08:08.862
so, yeah, it hurts.

08:08.864 --> 08:11.131
Aisha.

08:11.133 --> 08:13.366
I was setting up for her birthday party.

08:13.368 --> 08:14.933
Chest pains bowled me over.

08:14.935 --> 08:16.235
It's never been so bad.

08:16.237 --> 08:17.737
He's been working too hard,

08:17.739 --> 08:19.905
and he won't let me help enough at home.

08:19.907 --> 08:23.075
Pain's been pretty steady, so
I've been leaning on medication,

08:23.077 --> 08:24.310
putting off the doctor.

08:24.312 --> 08:25.844
It's my own damn fault.

08:25.846 --> 08:28.514
I have your C.T. angio of your
chest you got when you arrived.

08:28.516 --> 08:30.015
You have a pulmonary infarction

08:30.017 --> 08:32.549
caused by the compromised blood
flow from your sickle cell.

08:32.552 --> 08:33.885
That's not good.

08:33.888 --> 08:36.587
I'm gonna move you to the ICU
for some tests,

08:36.590 --> 08:39.024
and we'll see how you respond
to the antibiotics.

08:39.025 --> 08:41.626
Ideally, if that works,
no other steps are necessary.

08:41.628 --> 08:44.362
- Sounds like a plan.
- Great.

08:44.364 --> 08:45.764
Happy birthday,

08:45.766 --> 08:47.365
and you're gonna take good care
of your dad, all right?

08:47.367 --> 08:48.633
Great.

08:48.635 --> 08:49.934
Enjoy your coffee.

08:56.176 --> 08:57.475
Hey.

08:57.477 --> 08:58.810
I thought you weren't working today.

08:58.812 --> 09:01.646
I am putting in some study work
on my day off.

09:01.648 --> 09:04.248
Also, I finally caved
on Zach's online dating plan,

09:04.250 --> 09:06.851
and I'm meeting a few people
downstairs for coffee.

09:06.853 --> 09:08.189
- You're meeting them here.
- Yeah.

09:08.239 --> 09:09.258
Anyone who dates me

09:09.308 --> 09:12.190
has to get used to the fact
that I work all the time,

09:12.192 --> 09:16.027
so, yes, I'm meeting them here.

09:16.029 --> 09:19.296
Got to go.
Bachelor número uno is up.

09:19.298 --> 09:22.666
If I'm not back in five minutes, page 911.

09:22.668 --> 09:25.336
Yeah. This should go well.

09:26.772 --> 09:28.639
Roland.

09:28.641 --> 09:32.108
Wow. Maggie.

09:32.110 --> 09:33.344
- You're pretty.
- Ah.

09:33.346 --> 09:35.045
No one ever looks
like their profile picture.

09:35.047 --> 09:36.246
It usually goes the other way.

09:36.248 --> 09:38.448
Well, I'm so glad
I didn't disappoint you.

09:38.450 --> 09:39.382
Sit.

09:39.384 --> 09:41.218
I ordered you a Guillermo...

09:41.220 --> 09:43.453
iced espresso, lime, and soda water.

09:43.455 --> 09:46.389
Ooh, that sounds like an abomination.

09:48.593 --> 09:49.625
You're hilarious.

09:49.627 --> 09:50.793
So, you're a doctor?

09:50.795 --> 09:52.528
I am. I just started a study...

09:52.530 --> 09:53.896
I'm an app developer,

09:53.898 --> 09:56.532
about to roll out a pretty dope
dating app, actually.

09:56.534 --> 09:57.667
It rates women.

09:57.669 --> 10:00.169
I know that sounds bad, but hear me out.

10:00.171 --> 10:02.505
Let's say I go out on a date, okay?

10:02.507 --> 10:05.408
Her picture is like an 8,
but she's maybe a 6.

10:05.410 --> 10:06.876
Her personality is like a 4,

10:06.878 --> 10:09.611
so someone else, for sure,
wrote her profile for her.

10:09.613 --> 10:12.948
I can rate her using the app,
which aggregates profiles,

10:12.950 --> 10:16.418
so the next guy that goes in...
He's got the full picture.

10:16.420 --> 10:18.520
- You've got to be kidding me.
- Don't worry.

10:18.522 --> 10:20.990
I'm rolling out another
version... for the ladies.

10:20.992 --> 10:22.992
So I could rate you.
You sure you'd want that?

10:22.994 --> 10:24.526
Pretty sure I'd do just fine.

10:24.528 --> 10:26.060
I'm leaving now.

10:26.062 --> 10:27.529
- Stay.
- Okay.

10:27.531 --> 10:29.364
I want to hear all about you...

10:29.366 --> 10:31.433
hopes, dreams, the whole nine yards.

10:31.435 --> 10:34.002
Ooh, is that a mole on your cheek?

10:34.004 --> 10:35.504
Yeah, what about it?

10:35.506 --> 10:37.305
I really think you should get it
checked out, Roland.

10:37.307 --> 10:39.073
Like, immediately.

10:40.444 --> 10:42.310
Really? Seriously?

10:42.312 --> 10:45.346
I'm getting paged.
Um, good luck with the app.

10:45.348 --> 10:48.883
I-I really hope you're around
to see it launched.

10:54.057 --> 10:56.090
Leo, Anna, we've got your test results.

10:56.092 --> 10:57.525
10 years in the E.R.,

10:57.527 --> 10:59.427
I've never seen anything quite like you two.

10:59.429 --> 11:01.762
You're like a tropical infection
ice cream shop,

11:01.764 --> 11:04.097
and all the flavors are bad. Jump in.

11:04.099 --> 11:08.669
Leo, you've contracted malaria,
E. coli, schistosomiasis,

11:08.671 --> 11:12.973
a flatworm parasite,
and chigoe fleas in your feet.

11:12.975 --> 11:15.542
And, Anna, you have amoebic
dysentery, infected bites,

11:15.544 --> 11:17.277
and tumbu fly larvae in your leg.

11:17.279 --> 11:19.579
But the good news is Dr. Williams

11:19.581 --> 11:22.316
is dedicated to your care
head-to-toe all day.

11:22.318 --> 11:23.984
Why was Malawi so mean to us?

11:23.986 --> 11:25.652
What were you guys doing there?

11:25.654 --> 11:26.553
Relief work.

11:26.555 --> 11:27.487
Sounds noble.

11:27.489 --> 11:29.823
- Yeah. Right.
- Anna, please.

11:29.825 --> 11:31.558
God, please, not now.

11:31.560 --> 11:33.092
Get them prepped.

11:33.094 --> 11:36.329
So, Dr. Williams, they're gonna
need fluids, blood cultures,

11:36.331 --> 11:39.098
antibiotics, malaria smears,
liver function tests.

11:39.100 --> 11:41.601
Oh, and best for last...

11:41.603 --> 11:42.936
larvae extraction.

11:42.938 --> 11:45.171
So have fun.

11:45.173 --> 11:46.573
Mm.

11:48.977 --> 11:51.110
He's not getting better.

11:51.112 --> 11:52.778
I know.

11:52.780 --> 11:55.514
So, Dion, the infected tissue in your lung

11:55.516 --> 11:57.950
isn't responding to the antibiotics,

11:57.952 --> 12:00.152
which means I'm gonna have to
drain the abscess,

12:00.154 --> 12:02.221
and we'll likely remove
the necrotic section,

12:02.223 --> 12:04.990
which, as you know, is not ideal.

12:04.992 --> 12:06.625
Is it really the only option?

12:06.627 --> 12:10.829
I'll sign the consent forms.
Let's get this done.

12:10.831 --> 12:12.197
It's gonna be okay.

12:12.199 --> 12:13.832
Promise me he won't die.

12:13.834 --> 12:17.836
Nobody can make a promise like that, baby.

12:17.838 --> 12:19.137
She's gonna do her best.

12:19.139 --> 12:21.739
Aisha, I promise that
I will work as hard as I can

12:21.741 --> 12:22.974
for your father.

12:22.976 --> 12:24.542
And if everything goes well, then we'll...

12:24.544 --> 12:26.378
Dr. Reid, they're ready in the O.R.

12:26.380 --> 12:28.446
Okay, will you stay with Aisha, please?

12:28.448 --> 12:31.016
I'll come and find you
as soon as the surgery's over.

12:31.018 --> 12:33.284
I'll see you soon.

12:47.491 --> 12:49.025
You okay, Charlie?

12:49.027 --> 12:51.360
Yep. So long as he's still not paralyzed.

12:51.362 --> 12:52.995
Dr. Sekara, how's he doing?

12:52.997 --> 12:55.431
Uh, all's well in the neuromonitor.

12:55.433 --> 12:57.399
- Dr. Sharpe?
- B.P.'s steady so far.

12:57.401 --> 12:59.101
I don't know how you two are so calm.

12:59.103 --> 13:01.770
No, no. I'm not calm. I'm screaming inside.

13:01.772 --> 13:03.439
If that makes you feel any better.

13:03.441 --> 13:05.674
- Actually, no.
- You got this, Dana.

13:05.676 --> 13:06.942
No, of course I do.

13:06.944 --> 13:08.277
I mean, I've got a plan.

13:08.279 --> 13:10.278
I've got Dr. Sekara here to assist.

13:10.280 --> 13:12.580
And it looks way worse than it is, right?

13:12.582 --> 13:15.550
Is it true this guy's some
sort of paranormal debunker?

13:15.552 --> 13:17.385
Maybe he can do an exorcism on Hope Zion.

13:17.387 --> 13:19.755
This place must be full
of ghosts after all these years.

13:19.757 --> 13:22.190
Well, like the man says...

13:22.192 --> 13:24.459
no such thing, right?

13:26.963 --> 13:28.396
Sorry about my daughter.

13:28.398 --> 13:31.666
She can be a bit... intense.

13:31.668 --> 13:33.901
I'm in a pretty bad way, aren't I?

13:36.473 --> 13:40.007
Dion, if there are relatives
that can be here for Aisha

13:40.009 --> 13:43.677
in a worst-case scenario, now's the time,

13:43.679 --> 13:45.980
like her mother?

13:45.982 --> 13:50.050
I met Aisha's mom up here
from Florida for work.

13:50.052 --> 13:52.452
We met in a club,

13:52.454 --> 13:54.688
ended up spending the weekend together.

13:54.690 --> 13:58.458
It was nice, but that was that.

13:58.460 --> 14:01.227
Six years later, she calls me,

14:01.229 --> 14:03.363
tells me she's dying of cancer,

14:03.365 --> 14:06.633
and that I have a little girl.

14:06.635 --> 14:09.336
That is quite a phone call.

14:09.338 --> 14:11.971
I flew up, met Aisha.

14:11.973 --> 14:14.374
Love at first sight.

14:14.376 --> 14:15.909
Her mom's dying of cancer,

14:15.911 --> 14:20.079
and she's trying so hard to be brave.

14:20.081 --> 14:23.649
So three years ago, I moved up here,

14:23.651 --> 14:26.019
became a dad full time.

14:26.021 --> 14:28.654
Did she inherit the sickle cell?

14:28.656 --> 14:29.823
No...

14:29.825 --> 14:33.526
but she didn't inherit any family, either.

14:33.528 --> 14:35.394
I'm working on it,

14:35.396 --> 14:38.764
talking to some folks from our church.

14:38.766 --> 14:42.034
I know how it goes with this disease.

14:42.036 --> 14:46.305
With proper management, you
could have 20 years, maybe more.

14:46.307 --> 14:49.942
Just, please, don't let it be today.

14:51.778 --> 14:54.947
I know what it's like
to lose a father so young.

14:54.949 --> 14:56.448
I will do everything I can

14:56.450 --> 14:59.885
to make sure that she doesn't
have to go through that.

14:59.887 --> 15:01.686
I'll see you soon.

15:09.796 --> 15:11.730
So, what kind of relief work was it?

15:11.732 --> 15:13.865
The kind that completely backfires.

15:13.867 --> 15:17.101
I called it Operation Save the People

15:17.103 --> 15:20.338
because we wanted to go there and, uh...

15:20.340 --> 15:21.606
s-save people.

15:22.376 --> 15:24.508
My brother watched
a documentary about Malawi

15:24.510 --> 15:26.043
one night after a party,

15:26.045 --> 15:27.378
a party where he found out

15:27.380 --> 15:29.380
that all our friends
were calling us "trustafarians"

15:29.382 --> 15:30.381
behind our backs.

15:30.383 --> 15:32.716
Useless trust-fund hippies.

15:32.718 --> 15:34.151
Next morning, he wakes me up

15:34.153 --> 15:36.754
and guilts me into
getting onto a plane to Malawi.

15:36.756 --> 15:38.389
So, not a lot of time to prepare.

15:38.391 --> 15:43.193
No malaria prophylaxis,
no water purifier, no maps?

15:43.195 --> 15:44.395
Before we knew it,

15:44.397 --> 15:46.830
we were in the middle of nowhere
digging a well.

15:46.832 --> 15:50.267
Did you know that wells
have to go, like, really deep,

15:50.269 --> 15:52.936
and you can't just dig them
on the side of the road?

15:52.938 --> 15:54.438
Yeah, that makes sense.

15:54.440 --> 15:57.374
We... we wanted to live like the locals.

15:57.376 --> 15:58.574
We drank the water,

15:58.576 --> 16:00.676
ate the food that
we didn't really recognize,

16:00.678 --> 16:02.045
and slept in the open.

16:02.047 --> 16:04.814
By the end of it, the people
that we went to go save...

16:04.816 --> 16:06.482
They had to save us.

16:06.484 --> 16:08.584
- I'm gonna throw up again.
- Oh. Okay.

16:08.586 --> 16:10.820
Dr. Williams, can...

16:10.822 --> 16:12.555
- Yep?
- You good?

16:12.557 --> 16:13.723
Nope.

16:13.725 --> 16:15.224
Great.

16:18.897 --> 16:20.863
- Oh, hey, um...
- Hey.

16:20.865 --> 16:22.832
Surprise party for Alex tonight.
Can you and Dawn come?

16:22.834 --> 16:25.668
Sure. Yeah.

16:25.670 --> 16:27.136
Well, don't get too excited.

16:27.138 --> 16:28.737
Is everything okay with you two?

16:28.739 --> 16:30.372
Yes, actually.

16:30.374 --> 16:32.574
She invited me to move in with her.

16:33.911 --> 16:37.980
Dr. Bell, not wasting any time
locking it down, huh?

16:37.982 --> 16:40.349
What did you say?

16:40.351 --> 16:41.516
I felt no, and I said yes.

16:41.518 --> 16:43.218
I don't know, it just seems too practical,

16:43.220 --> 16:44.986
and I feel like
it's kind of moving too fast.

16:44.988 --> 16:47.155
And I just have been in this
situation before, you know?

16:47.157 --> 16:48.490
Can I...

16:48.492 --> 16:49.925
back out of saying yes at this point?

16:49.927 --> 16:51.760
Oh, no, I am the last person
you should be asking.

16:51.762 --> 16:53.662
Don't, don't, don't, don't,
don't, don't, don't, don't.

16:53.664 --> 16:55.396
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:55.398 --> 16:58.600
I was just inviting you both to
Alex's surprise party tonight.

16:58.602 --> 16:59.968
- Oh, that sounds good.
- Yeah?
- Yep.

16:59.970 --> 17:01.235
Yeah, what can we bring?

17:01.237 --> 17:03.771
I'm gonna e-mail the details.
I, uh, have to go.

17:03.773 --> 17:05.806
I have a coffee date.

17:05.808 --> 17:07.474
Oh, good. You're doing that.
Any good prospects so far?

17:07.477 --> 17:10.944
Let's just hope this one
goes better than the last.

17:16.286 --> 17:18.551
Are you okay with what we talked
about this morning?

17:18.554 --> 17:19.987
What? Yeah, of course. Why?

17:19.989 --> 17:22.823
Because you're acting weird.

17:22.825 --> 17:23.924
No, I'm not.

17:23.925 --> 17:25.626
- Yeah, you are.
- No, I'm not.

17:25.627 --> 17:27.394
I'm walking down the hall

17:27.396 --> 17:31.699
going to check on some test
results of a test that I did.

17:31.701 --> 17:32.766
So...

17:35.270 --> 17:37.371
- I'll see you soon.
- Okay.

17:39.475 --> 17:40.607
Not weird.

17:42.744 --> 17:45.512
Sorry. Sorry.

17:45.514 --> 17:48.015
Trying to close a thing.

17:48.017 --> 17:51.217
Has to happen now.

17:51.219 --> 17:53.219
And...

17:53.221 --> 17:55.021
okay, I'm done.

17:55.023 --> 17:57.891
So, you said you're a gynecologist?

17:57.893 --> 17:59.893
I trained as one, but that's not all I do.

17:59.895 --> 18:02.562
I actually just... just embarking on a fellowship.

18:02.564 --> 18:04.063
Um, ohh, it never stops.

18:04.065 --> 18:07.166
I should have this thing
surgically attached to my hand.

18:07.168 --> 18:08.434
I'm sure I could arrange that.

18:08.436 --> 18:11.137
Just one more second.

18:11.139 --> 18:13.572
I'm so interested
in what you're saying.

18:13.574 --> 18:15.241
I really don't think you are.

18:15.243 --> 18:16.375
I beg your pardon?

18:16.377 --> 18:18.344
It's just the phone. It's rude.

18:18.346 --> 18:20.212
Wow!

18:20.214 --> 18:21.347
Here we go.

18:21.349 --> 18:23.715
Five minutes,
and you're already a clinger.

18:23.717 --> 18:26.885
No, I'm not, and I'm gonna prove
it to you by saying goodbye.

18:26.887 --> 18:28.921
I hope you and your phone
have a beautiful life together.

18:28.923 --> 18:30.121
Sorry. What?

18:30.123 --> 18:32.257
No, I'm sorry
that we've wasted our time.

18:33.661 --> 18:36.361
This isn't about my phone, is it?

18:36.363 --> 18:37.629
If you ask me,

18:37.631 --> 18:40.465
I think you're not sure what
you're actually looking for.

18:40.467 --> 18:43.301
Maybe not, but I am sure
that I'm not looking for you.

18:43.303 --> 18:44.936
Take care.

18:46.873 --> 18:49.441
A little bird tells me
it's your birthday, Alex.

18:49.443 --> 18:51.109
Another year on earth. Congrats.

18:51.111 --> 18:52.477
Little bird tells you wrong.

18:52.479 --> 18:54.179
Oh, someone's here with a cake
for you, Dr. Reid.

18:54.181 --> 18:55.380
They're very insistent.

18:55.382 --> 18:58.449
Well, tell them I'm in surgery,
and I don't want it.

19:00.687 --> 19:02.119
Actually, you know what?

19:02.121 --> 19:03.854
Why don't you share it
with the other nurses?

19:03.856 --> 19:04.922
You sure? It looks fancy.

19:04.924 --> 19:06.791
Yeah, I'm sure. Thanks.

19:08.728 --> 19:09.560
What is it?

19:09.562 --> 19:10.695
S.T. elevation.

19:10.697 --> 19:12.763
Arterial pressure's dropping. Venous is up.

19:12.765 --> 19:14.098
Must be a third-degree heart block.

19:14.100 --> 19:15.132
Rate's only 30.

19:15.134 --> 19:16.233
I wonder if the sickle cell

19:16.235 --> 19:18.068
is blocking the blood flow
to the heart muscle.

19:18.070 --> 19:19.736
Haven't finished with the lung yet.

19:19.738 --> 19:20.704
We need pacing.

19:20.706 --> 19:21.871
Get Dawn Bell down here right now.

19:23.875 --> 19:27.478
Come on, Dion.

19:27.480 --> 19:29.679
Dr. Kinney, it's all yours.

19:29.681 --> 19:31.748
Give me a shout.

19:46.897 --> 19:49.665
So, you followed him here from the house.

19:49.667 --> 19:53.236
I followed him.
Not from there.

19:53.238 --> 19:56.639
Then from where and why?

19:56.641 --> 19:57.840
Miles.

19:57.842 --> 19:59.609
It can't be you.

19:59.611 --> 20:01.377
It's me, Garth.

20:01.379 --> 20:02.678
Okay, what is happening here?

20:02.680 --> 20:05.714
I've been with you
the whole time.

20:05.716 --> 20:08.283
That's not possible.

20:08.285 --> 20:10.352
I killed you.

20:19.039 --> 20:20.171
B.P.'s dropping fast, Dr. Kinney.

20:20.173 --> 20:21.872
- Yeah.
- What's going on, Dana?

20:21.874 --> 20:24.208
Moving him must have let loose
a bleed tamponaded by the impalement.

20:24.210 --> 20:25.576
Okay, here we go.

20:25.578 --> 20:27.845
Three, two, one.

20:27.847 --> 20:30.648
- Whoa! There's so much blood.
- I need a clamp.

20:30.650 --> 20:32.616
I'm seeing fecal matter here.
The colon must have torn.

20:32.618 --> 20:34.251
- Clamp.
- Tell me what I can do.

20:34.253 --> 20:35.486
Dr. Kinney, he's bottoming out.

20:35.488 --> 20:36.554
We need a decision, Dana.

20:36.556 --> 20:38.055
The wood must have splintered.

20:38.057 --> 20:40.423
It's perforated the colon,
severed the iliac artery.

20:40.425 --> 20:41.791
Hang more blood. All we've got.

20:41.793 --> 20:44.094
The artery's too damaged to repair.

20:44.096 --> 20:45.428
We're gonna tie it off at both ends

20:45.430 --> 20:46.663
and bridge-graft the opposing iliac

20:46.665 --> 20:48.098
to keep the leg from going ischemic.

20:48.100 --> 20:50.433
We didn't save his mobility
just to have him lose the leg.

20:50.435 --> 20:52.269
What about the contamination
from the pierced colon?

20:52.271 --> 20:53.870
We're gonna place the graft retroperitoneal.

20:53.872 --> 20:55.204
That'll keep it out of the bad stuff.

20:55.206 --> 20:57.173
Everyone clear on this?

20:57.175 --> 20:58.140
It's a good plan, Dana.

20:58.142 --> 21:00.109
Then let's do it.

21:02.347 --> 21:03.813
Are you okay, Alex?

21:03.815 --> 21:04.914
Yeah, I'm fine.

21:04.916 --> 21:07.384
I'm just hoping for a good outcome.

21:07.386 --> 21:10.052
- That's all.
- Aren't we all?

21:10.054 --> 21:12.688
The patient's a single father.
It's his daughter's birthday.

21:12.690 --> 21:14.991
My dad died on my birthday
when I was around her age.

21:14.993 --> 21:16.492
I just...

21:16.494 --> 21:19.262
I don't want her
to go through the same thing.

21:19.264 --> 21:20.930
Pacing pads in place. Clear.

21:27.004 --> 21:29.405
It's working. Keep transfusing him.

21:29.407 --> 21:31.206
With his lung surgery, cardiac issues,

21:31.208 --> 21:32.741
risk of another crisis, it's...

21:32.743 --> 21:34.075
Yeah. I know.

21:34.077 --> 21:35.944
Alex, I didn't know about your father.

21:35.946 --> 21:37.780
I'm sorry.

21:37.782 --> 21:38.914
That little girl...

21:38.916 --> 21:40.115
she's lucky to have you in her dad's corner.

21:40.117 --> 21:44.219
I hope so.

21:44.221 --> 21:46.021
Pericostal sutures, please.

21:48.940 --> 21:52.135
Okay, time to extract your larva.

21:52.185 --> 21:53.895
Awesome.

21:54.344 --> 21:55.940
He's not feeling any better?

21:55.990 --> 21:57.432
Mnh-mnh.

21:57.978 --> 22:01.199
Mad as I am at him for getting
me into this, he was right.

22:01.387 --> 22:03.422
We needed to do something with our lives.

22:03.472 --> 22:04.939
It's just it probably would have been

22:04.941 --> 22:06.307
a really good idea to have a plan.

22:07.222 --> 22:09.143
I have to ask...

22:09.145 --> 22:10.844
When you got there and you realized

22:10.846 --> 22:12.379
you were in over your heads,

22:12.381 --> 22:14.348
why didn't you
just turn around and come home?

22:14.857 --> 22:17.317
We were too ashamed to fail.

22:17.319 --> 22:19.719
E-Especially when people started
laughing at us,

22:19.721 --> 22:21.488
like, when we tried to build a school

22:21.490 --> 22:23.924
out of... out of mud blocks...

22:23.926 --> 22:25.158
We built one wall,

22:25.160 --> 22:27.761
and then...
and then it just fell down.

22:29.798 --> 22:32.165
Hey, are... are you okay, Dr. Williams?

22:32.167 --> 22:33.499
I, um...

22:33.501 --> 22:38.271
I have a real phobia of parasites.

22:38.273 --> 22:39.939
How did this thing get in your leg?

22:39.941 --> 22:42.375
Oh, the... the tumbu fly...

22:42.377 --> 22:45.244
It lays its eggs in your clothes
when they're drying.

22:45.246 --> 22:48.047
And then, when you put them
back on, the eggs hatch,

22:48.049 --> 22:50.683
and the larvae burrow themselves
into your skin.

22:50.685 --> 22:52.417
I know this now.

22:52.419 --> 22:54.252
Oh, my God.

22:54.254 --> 22:57.089
Why do these things exist?

22:57.091 --> 23:00.359
Hey, I know this is, like, your
worst nightmare and everything,

23:00.361 --> 23:01.861
but it would be so cool

23:01.863 --> 23:05.097
if you could just get
the maggots out of my leg now.

23:05.099 --> 23:07.732
Okay.

23:16.576 --> 23:19.444
Ohh!

23:19.446 --> 23:22.680
Okay! I did it!

23:22.682 --> 23:24.482
That wasn't so bad!

23:33.393 --> 23:34.826
Hey.

23:34.828 --> 23:36.694
- Are you Maggie?
- Spencer?

23:36.696 --> 23:38.496
You've been right here this whole time?

23:38.498 --> 23:40.097
Yeah, I just gave up on you.

23:40.099 --> 23:41.532
I was actually kind of relieved.

23:41.534 --> 23:44.068
Oh, this dating thing's been going
that well for you, too, huh?

23:44.070 --> 23:46.270
Last three weeks, I've been thrown up on.

23:46.272 --> 23:47.538
I've been punched by an ex-husband.

23:47.540 --> 23:49.073
I had one woman threaten to kill herself

23:49.075 --> 23:50.274
if we didn't go on a second date.

23:50.276 --> 23:51.342
Memorable first date?

23:51.344 --> 23:53.444
Uh, she wanted to look at baby furniture.

23:53.446 --> 23:55.112
Maybe jumping the gun a little.

23:55.114 --> 23:58.181
I keep telling myself
it will all be worth it

23:58.183 --> 23:59.249
if I meet the right person.

23:59.251 --> 24:02.485
So, what are you looking for?

24:07.259 --> 24:09.927
What's anybody looking for, I guess?

24:09.929 --> 24:10.994
Ever been married?

24:10.996 --> 24:13.163
Once. Three years.

24:13.165 --> 24:15.898
- What went wrong?
- Oh, so many things.

24:15.900 --> 24:18.000
I do own up to being
a less-than-ideal player

24:18.002 --> 24:19.235
in my failed relationship,

24:19.237 --> 24:21.304
but I wasn't unfaithful or mean or anything.

24:21.306 --> 24:22.838
You sure she'd say the same?

24:22.840 --> 24:24.607
You sure you're not a lawyer?

24:25.810 --> 24:27.444
I'm sorry. I'm grilling you.

24:27.446 --> 24:30.713
I think this isn't for me.

24:30.715 --> 24:33.049
Um, I'm sorry I wasted your time.

24:33.051 --> 24:34.383
Hey.

24:34.385 --> 24:36.719
I understand how weird
this can be, believe me.

24:36.721 --> 24:39.488
So if you change your mind,

24:39.490 --> 24:41.090
I'm up to try again.

24:43.194 --> 24:44.560
Well, any doubts anyone had

24:44.562 --> 24:45.994
about you cutting it in trauma, Dana,

24:45.996 --> 24:48.029
I'd say they're eating them right about now.

24:48.031 --> 24:50.132
I don't know, Charlie.

24:50.134 --> 24:52.401
My heart's beating like 500 times a minute.

24:52.403 --> 24:54.470
I haven't felt so alive in years.

24:54.472 --> 24:56.472
- Ready with more suction, Dr. Sekara?
- You got it.

24:56.474 --> 24:58.073
Dr. Sharpe?

24:58.075 --> 24:59.841
Stabilizing.

24:59.843 --> 25:02.376
You look like you've got
everything under control.

25:02.378 --> 25:03.578
You mind if I step out?

25:03.580 --> 25:06.081
Thank you for your help, Charlie.

25:19.729 --> 25:22.330
You need to tell me what's going on.

25:22.332 --> 25:23.697
Garth said he killed you.

25:23.699 --> 25:24.932
It's what he believes.

25:24.934 --> 25:26.234
What do you believe?

25:28.804 --> 25:30.438
Garth was my best friend.

25:30.440 --> 25:33.407
We liked doing things
that we weren't supposed to,

25:33.409 --> 25:36.677
like going to abandoned
buildings and stuff like that.

25:36.679 --> 25:38.712
Garth found an ax in one,

25:38.714 --> 25:42.549
smashed it on a post
over and over again

25:42.551 --> 25:44.752
until the ceiling collapsed.

25:44.754 --> 25:47.054
Garth was hurt real bad.

25:47.056 --> 25:50.290
Needed a liver transplant.

25:50.292 --> 25:52.359
I saw it all
before I figured it out.

25:52.361 --> 25:53.793
That you were dead.

25:53.795 --> 25:55.995
It was my liver he got.

25:55.997 --> 25:59.732
So you've been following him
for 20 years. Why?

25:59.734 --> 26:02.235
To tell him
that it wasn't his fault.

26:02.237 --> 26:05.639
All the time he spends
proving there's no ghosts...

26:05.641 --> 26:08.641
That's just him trying to deny
that he has one of his own.

26:08.643 --> 26:11.544
That's pretty smart for a 12-year-old.

26:11.546 --> 26:14.047
I've been 12
for 20 years, mister.

26:14.049 --> 26:17.784
This could be my only real
chance to get through to him.

26:17.786 --> 26:19.052
I need your help.

26:26.327 --> 26:27.125
Aisha?

26:27.127 --> 26:29.328
How is he?

26:29.330 --> 26:32.364
Well, we were able to take care
of his lung infection,

26:32.366 --> 26:34.933
but there were complications during surgery,

26:34.935 --> 26:36.468
so his condition is still very serious.

26:36.470 --> 26:39.004
People are coming to my party.

26:39.006 --> 26:41.139
He's got to be there or it won't happen.

26:41.141 --> 26:42.941
Aisha, your father
is fighting for his life.

26:42.943 --> 26:44.876
There is no way, even
in a best-case scenario,

26:44.878 --> 26:45.977
that he's going home today.

26:47.815 --> 26:50.015
You don't know anything!

26:57.806 --> 26:58.639
Dr. Williams.

26:58.641 --> 27:00.607
Dr. Williams.

27:00.609 --> 27:01.809
- Dr. Williams.
- Hmm?

27:01.811 --> 27:03.310
You okay?

27:03.312 --> 27:06.847
- Ohh. Oh, no, I fainted.
- Yeah.

27:06.849 --> 27:08.281
- My patients.
- They're fine.

27:08.283 --> 27:09.650
Just... just take it easy, okay?

27:09.652 --> 27:11.617
I'm not fine. My head's killing me.

27:11.619 --> 27:12.852
Does Dr. Miller know?

27:12.854 --> 27:14.955
Now, don't worry about him. Are you okay?

27:14.957 --> 27:16.923
Yeah, I'm fine.

27:16.925 --> 27:17.857
Is that Leo?

27:17.859 --> 27:19.092
Some more imaging.

27:19.094 --> 27:22.295
Radiology said
you'd want to take a look.

27:24.166 --> 27:26.532
Oh, we need Dr. Hamza.

27:29.571 --> 27:31.270
I just made a little girl cry.

27:31.272 --> 27:33.506
Her father... her only family...
is hanging by a thread.

27:33.508 --> 27:36.876
Today is her birthday.
I am a monster.

27:36.878 --> 27:38.945
I just... I'm ... I'm sorry.

27:38.947 --> 27:41.614
It's just really hitting me
how much I hate him.

27:41.616 --> 27:43.449
Hate who?

27:43.451 --> 27:44.950
My dad!

27:44.952 --> 27:47.519
Of all the days that he could
have killed himself, why today?

27:47.521 --> 27:51.156
I mean, I know he was sick
and in pain, but why this day?

27:52.994 --> 27:56.228
Alex, did I ever tell you about high school?

28:03.637 --> 28:08.206
I wasn't the most accepted kid.

28:08.208 --> 28:13.044
I thought I'd be on the outside
looking in forever, you know?

28:13.046 --> 28:14.880
And at that time...

28:17.484 --> 28:20.851
there was only one way I could see out.

28:20.853 --> 28:22.786
Shahir, I'm... I'm... I'm sorry.

28:25.525 --> 28:28.059
When you don't see
anything good in yourself...

28:30.463 --> 28:32.830
ending your life might seem like a favor

28:32.832 --> 28:33.998
to those you love.

28:36.602 --> 28:38.301
So I think your father,

28:38.303 --> 28:42.740
in his own tortured way,

28:42.742 --> 28:44.441
was trying to spare you.

28:46.445 --> 28:48.879
I know. I-I know that most of the time.

28:48.881 --> 28:51.481
It's just with everything

28:51.483 --> 28:53.016
that's been going on between Charlie and me,

28:53.018 --> 28:54.851
I've been thinking about
growing up without a father.

28:54.853 --> 28:58.255
And I-I don't want Luke to have that life.

28:58.257 --> 29:02.759
But it's you and Charlie.

29:02.761 --> 29:04.561
See, whatever the two of you
are going through,

29:04.563 --> 29:06.696
I don't think you're gonna let
that make you bad parents.

29:06.698 --> 29:09.231
I hope you're right.

29:11.202 --> 29:12.401
Shahir, thank you.

29:12.403 --> 29:14.571
Yes, you're welcome.

29:14.573 --> 29:15.805
I'd better go find that girl.

29:18.577 --> 29:20.009
- Alex?
- Yeah?

29:20.011 --> 29:21.010
The nurses wouldn't touch this.

29:21.012 --> 29:22.178
They thought you should see it first.

29:22.180 --> 29:24.313
Thank you.

29:26.117 --> 29:29.452
Hey, we're
a couple of ace surgeons.

29:29.454 --> 29:32.088
Do you think we could turn
that "Alex" into an "Aisha"?

29:37.395 --> 29:39.295
Garth?

29:39.297 --> 29:40.528
Garth, where are you at?

29:40.530 --> 29:42.898
I'm here.

29:42.900 --> 29:46.501
I needed
to get away from him...

29:46.503 --> 29:49.071
and from you, too.

29:49.073 --> 29:51.106
Me? Why... Why me?

29:51.108 --> 29:54.409
Because I'm pretty sure
I'm a ghost right now,

29:54.411 --> 29:56.078
so if you can see me,

29:56.080 --> 29:58.379
I need to rethink
my career choices.

30:00.183 --> 30:03.585
Well, just because some ghosts are real

30:03.587 --> 30:06.387
doesn't mean that all ghosts are real.

30:06.389 --> 30:08.889
Miles is real.

30:08.891 --> 30:11.626
Yeah, Miles is real.

30:11.628 --> 30:13.327
But he doesn't mean you any harm.

30:13.329 --> 30:17.999
I killed him...
the best friend I ever had,

30:18.001 --> 30:21.636
the friend who saved my life.

30:21.638 --> 30:24.639
Miles needs to move on, but he can't.

30:24.641 --> 30:27.474
Maybe it's your turn to help him.

30:30.712 --> 30:32.279
I'll talk to him like you say.

30:32.281 --> 30:34.648
I owe him everything.

30:34.650 --> 30:37.951
The least I can do is set him free.

30:42.791 --> 30:46.026
Well, if it isn't the oath breaker.

30:46.028 --> 30:47.827
What's this?

30:47.829 --> 30:50.396
It's Leo's brain. See the abnormalities?

30:50.398 --> 30:52.465
I needed to check
with Dr. Hamza to confirm.

30:52.467 --> 30:55.368
Leo, you have neurocysticercosis.

30:55.370 --> 30:57.370
A parasitic worm has found
its way into your brain.

30:57.372 --> 30:59.105
It's relatively safe while it's still alive,

30:59.107 --> 31:00.874
but if it dies, it can be quite serious,

31:00.876 --> 31:02.142
so we do need to move quickly.

31:02.144 --> 31:04.410
It's likely you had it
before you went to Malawi.

31:04.412 --> 31:06.879
Um, improperly handled pork
is usually the culprit.

31:06.881 --> 31:08.214
Oh, my God!

31:08.216 --> 31:09.415
The dumplings from Galen's cottage...

31:09.417 --> 31:11.116
the ones that made everyone sick.

31:11.118 --> 31:13.819
You're telling me that I have
a worm living in my brain?

31:13.821 --> 31:16.222
- Yeah.
- Oh, God, I'm gonna die.

31:16.224 --> 31:17.890
I do one humanitarian act in my whole life,

31:17.892 --> 31:19.357
and now I'm gonna die?

31:19.359 --> 31:21.293
Well, we booked an O.R., and
we'll get you there right away.

31:21.295 --> 31:23.195
You're gonna be okay, Leo.

31:23.197 --> 31:24.462
You're gonna get through this.

31:24.464 --> 31:25.964
Yeah, that sounds great, Anna. Thanks.

31:25.966 --> 31:28.500
Just let me get the worm
out of my head, okay?

31:28.502 --> 31:30.235
Mm. I so get that.

31:30.237 --> 31:32.304
That was another great catch, Dr. Williams.

31:32.306 --> 31:34.006
You really should consider neuro.

31:34.008 --> 31:37.141
- Don't you think, Dr. Miller?
- Mm-hmm.

31:37.143 --> 31:39.877
In the meantime, you can finish
with the extraction.

31:39.879 --> 31:42.380
I got a ham sandwich I need to throw out.

31:48.689 --> 31:49.954
Hey.

31:51.258 --> 31:54.325
- Uh, I got your, "I'm sorry," text?
- Mm-hmm.

31:54.327 --> 31:56.694
I was still here, so I found you.

31:56.696 --> 31:57.862
Why were you still here?

31:57.864 --> 31:59.563
I remembered I knew someone
who used to work here,

31:59.565 --> 32:00.397
but he was busy.

32:00.399 --> 32:01.565
Uh, you know Dr. Sharpe?

32:01.567 --> 32:02.867
He's an old friend from college.

32:02.869 --> 32:04.035
You know Wayne?

32:04.037 --> 32:06.437
Oh, let's just say
we called him "The Sandman"

32:06.439 --> 32:08.172
long before he was an anesthetist.

32:08.174 --> 32:09.573
Wayne was a drug dealer?

32:09.575 --> 32:11.742
Oh, no, he was just really good
at beach volleyball.

32:11.744 --> 32:12.843
Oh.

32:12.845 --> 32:14.111
But I got to ask,

32:14.113 --> 32:15.713
with so many good-looking
doctors around here,

32:15.715 --> 32:17.047
why'd you go looking online?

32:18.070 --> 32:21.619
Uh, well, I got into a bad habit
of dating my co-workers,

32:21.621 --> 32:23.387
and I want to change that.

32:23.389 --> 32:26.689
So, um...

32:26.691 --> 32:29.192
do you want to go for a drink close by

32:29.194 --> 32:31.094
when you finish your shift?

32:31.096 --> 32:32.229
I can't.

32:32.231 --> 32:34.430
I have to plan this surprise
party for my friend.

32:34.432 --> 32:37.000
Well, then, you are in luck,
because I am an event planner.

32:37.002 --> 32:38.101
Parties is my business.

32:38.103 --> 32:41.238
We can do an
Enchantment Under the Sea theme,

32:41.240 --> 32:45.875
a Teddy Bear Picnic,
whatever your heart desires.

32:45.877 --> 32:46.976
I don't know.

32:46.978 --> 32:48.611
Oh, come on. Let me help you.

32:55.820 --> 32:58.487
Dion?

32:58.489 --> 32:59.554
How are you feeling?

32:59.556 --> 33:01.390
I'm still here,

33:01.392 --> 33:03.625
which sounds more like
good news than it feels.

33:03.627 --> 33:06.929
Well, you suffered
a cardiac event during surgery,

33:06.931 --> 33:08.397
so recovery's gonna be tough.

33:08.399 --> 33:10.299
You're gonna have to make a change.

33:10.301 --> 33:11.566
You're gonna have to slow down.

33:11.568 --> 33:13.602
Easy to say when you're not
the single parent

33:13.604 --> 33:15.504
of a 9-year-old perpetual motion machine.

33:15.506 --> 33:18.307
True, but...

33:18.309 --> 33:20.809
I know that you're gonna want
to watch her grow up,

33:20.811 --> 33:23.044
to celebrate all the great
things she's gonna do

33:23.046 --> 33:26.147
and cheer her up the first time
her heart's broken.

33:26.149 --> 33:27.516
I know she'll want that, too.

33:27.518 --> 33:30.419
I'm not gonna put her through
this again if I can help it,

33:30.421 --> 33:31.452
I'll tell you that.

33:31.454 --> 33:33.822
That's good to hear.

33:33.824 --> 33:34.956
Believe me.

33:34.958 --> 33:37.992
Great dads aren't easy to come by.

33:37.994 --> 33:40.628
Dr. Reid.

33:40.630 --> 33:43.364
I'm sorry. I was selfish.

33:43.366 --> 33:46.067
I just thought
if he could come to the party

33:46.069 --> 33:48.502
that everything would be okay.

33:48.504 --> 33:49.970
Not like with my mom.

33:52.141 --> 33:54.675
You know what?

33:54.677 --> 33:56.744
I'm sorry, too.

33:56.746 --> 33:59.079
You know those kids that were
gonna come to your party?

33:59.081 --> 34:01.349
Do you think you could
convince them to come here?

34:01.351 --> 34:03.818
I know it's not exactly party central,

34:03.820 --> 34:05.819
but we do have a cake for you.

34:05.821 --> 34:07.221
You do?

34:07.223 --> 34:08.889
Yeah.

34:08.891 --> 34:11.757
Happy birthday, Aisha.

35:00.172 --> 35:02.072
Want to read?

35:33.906 --> 35:35.204
Hey.

35:35.206 --> 35:36.540
Hey.

35:36.542 --> 35:38.174
I, uh, saw you on the boards today.

35:38.176 --> 35:39.275
How'd the arm do?

35:39.277 --> 35:42.145
Oh, it was fine.

35:42.147 --> 35:44.314
Happy birthday, by the way.

35:44.316 --> 35:45.214
Thank you.

35:45.216 --> 35:47.417
Why didn't you go in?

35:47.419 --> 35:50.987
Oh, well, I'm just waiting
for you to get home, actually.

35:50.989 --> 35:53.222
I just need to pick up a few things, then...

35:53.224 --> 35:54.590
then I'll be on my way.

35:54.592 --> 35:56.859
I may have wanted to, you know,

35:56.861 --> 35:59.395
see Luke, kiss him good night.

35:59.397 --> 36:02.031
Sure. Yeah.

36:04.436 --> 36:05.701
While you're in there, could you tell me

36:05.703 --> 36:07.069
if the nanny's as terrible
as I think she is?

36:07.071 --> 36:09.404
Oh, no.

36:12.076 --> 36:13.843
- Shall we go in?
- Sure.

36:21.652 --> 36:24.419
Surprise!

36:24.421 --> 36:29.191
Hey!

36:33.025 --> 36:36.527
Oh, my God!
Everybody, um, I had no idea.

36:36.658 --> 36:38.394
Wow.

36:38.396 --> 36:40.376
- Um.
- But you can thank Maggie

36:40.426 --> 36:41.683
for carrying the birthday ball.

36:41.733 --> 36:43.800
Maggs...

36:43.802 --> 36:45.735
you're the best.

36:45.737 --> 36:46.803
Happy birthday.

36:48.707 --> 36:53.043
Okay, everyone, we are here,
so, um, let's have some fun.

36:53.045 --> 36:56.212
All right?

36:56.214 --> 36:57.213
Wow.

36:57.215 --> 37:00.115
Welcome to your, uh, worst nightmare.

37:00.117 --> 37:02.951
- You weren't in on this, were you?
- No. No, no way.

37:02.953 --> 37:04.587
You weren't even invited.

37:04.589 --> 37:06.055
No.

37:06.057 --> 37:08.991
Maggie doesn't really know where
we're at, so I don't blame her.

37:08.993 --> 37:10.458
- You can stay.
- No.

37:10.460 --> 37:13.195
No, I'm gonna slip out of here.

37:13.197 --> 37:15.297
Tell Luke I'll see him tomorrow.

37:15.299 --> 37:18.834
And, um, it's your birthday.

37:18.836 --> 37:20.302
Try to have fun, Alex.

37:20.304 --> 37:22.537
Thanks.

37:22.539 --> 37:24.573
- Good night.
- Good night.

37:28.812 --> 37:29.777
Hey.

37:29.779 --> 37:30.712
Hmm?

37:30.714 --> 37:32.247
- Come here.
- Okay.

37:34.851 --> 37:36.184
Sit.

37:36.186 --> 37:38.687
Oh, sweetie, we never should
have thrown you this party.

37:38.689 --> 37:40.355
No, no. You know what? it's great.

37:40.357 --> 37:42.224
Oh, you are the worst liar ever.

37:42.226 --> 37:43.691
You hate your birthday.

37:43.693 --> 37:44.859
I do.

37:44.861 --> 37:46.327
But you know what?
Everyone I have ever known,

37:46.329 --> 37:48.295
including Charlie, has tried to fix it.

37:48.297 --> 37:50.998
Did we, um...
Did we interrupt something

37:51.000 --> 37:52.800
with the two of you when... ?

37:52.802 --> 37:55.770
No. Maybe. I-I don't know.

37:55.772 --> 37:58.072
What is going on?

37:58.074 --> 38:00.040
It's... It's really hard to explain.

38:00.042 --> 38:03.844
Try me. Please.

38:03.846 --> 38:04.978
Dana, you're just gonna have to trust

38:04.980 --> 38:06.012
that I'm doing the right thing.

38:06.014 --> 38:08.849
For me, for Charlie, Luke... everyone.

38:11.754 --> 38:13.554
I will.

38:13.556 --> 38:14.988
I'm sorry.

38:21.096 --> 38:22.295
Hey.

38:22.297 --> 38:23.997
Oh, hey.

38:23.999 --> 38:25.498
Everybody's having a great time.

38:25.500 --> 38:26.566
Why do you look so down?

38:26.568 --> 38:28.068
You saw her face when she walked in.

38:28.070 --> 38:29.236
This was a terrible mistake.

38:29.238 --> 38:30.670
Your friend hated her birthday.

38:30.672 --> 38:32.338
You tried
to turn that around for her.

38:32.340 --> 38:33.539
You can't fault your intentions,

38:33.541 --> 38:35.508
even if, you know, you misjudged a little.

38:35.510 --> 38:36.942
You think?

38:36.944 --> 38:38.444
You two will be laughing
about this tomorrow.

38:38.446 --> 38:40.680
This is a great party.

38:40.682 --> 38:43.983
Alex... She's, um... She's
lucky to have you as a friend.

38:43.985 --> 38:45.985
You're nice.

38:45.987 --> 38:50.756
Um, I was thinking maybe later next week,

38:50.758 --> 38:52.825
I could take you out to dinner
to say thank you.

38:52.827 --> 38:54.794
I'd like that.

38:54.796 --> 38:55.861
Can I bring Mother?

38:58.666 --> 39:02.067
I'm kidding.

39:02.069 --> 39:05.171
Anybody see a... a cocktail shaker?

39:05.173 --> 39:07.839
I'm gonna make some of my secret
recipe knockout bourbonades.

39:07.841 --> 39:12.277
The real secret is more alcohol.

39:14.682 --> 39:16.782
- Hey.
- I'm starving.

39:16.784 --> 39:18.383
I haven't eaten anything all day,

39:18.385 --> 39:19.651
and all I keep thinking about

39:19.653 --> 39:21.252
is what's squirming around
in the spinach dip

39:21.254 --> 39:23.621
or what laid eggs in the fruit.

39:23.623 --> 39:26.624
Don't even get me started
on the cheese mites.

39:26.626 --> 39:28.492
Look, I've always believed

39:28.494 --> 39:30.761
that tough love
is the way to go in the E.R.,

39:30.763 --> 39:34.699
but I might have maybe pushed
you a little bit too hard today.

39:34.701 --> 39:36.067
We're a team.

39:36.069 --> 39:39.102
We need to help each other out.

39:39.104 --> 39:40.904
Maybe I needed to face my phobia.

39:40.906 --> 39:42.906
I was impressed by your fortitude...

39:42.908 --> 39:44.975
before the fainting, that is, I mean.

39:44.977 --> 39:46.844
- You heard?
- Oh, yeah.

39:46.846 --> 39:50.514
Oh, and just so you know,
my phobia... snakes.

39:50.516 --> 39:51.949
One got loose in the hospital,

39:51.951 --> 39:53.884
and I had a panic attack on the drive home.

39:53.886 --> 39:55.052
It was...

39:55.054 --> 39:56.987
Anyway, just don't tell anybody.

39:59.758 --> 40:01.791
Dr. Williams.

40:01.793 --> 40:04.127
The surgery with Leo Timblin went perfectly.

40:04.129 --> 40:05.795
The entire tapeworm came out clean.

40:05.797 --> 40:07.030
Nothing left behind.

40:07.032 --> 40:08.165
Kind of looked like

40:08.167 --> 40:09.499
those noodles you're eating right there.

40:11.237 --> 40:14.771
I call this "The Surgical Glove."

40:14.773 --> 40:16.873
Hey, you should probably get Cassie home,

40:16.875 --> 40:17.940
make her some toast.

40:17.942 --> 40:19.709
I don't know.
She's looking a little green.

40:19.711 --> 40:21.378
- Just let me talk to my girlfriend.
- And I just got my car detailed.

40:21.380 --> 40:22.579
Okay.

40:24.483 --> 40:27.784
You know, listen, about this
morning, I just... forget it.

40:27.786 --> 40:30.686
- It was just a thought, and...
- No. I mean, yes.

40:30.688 --> 40:32.154
I was a little uneasy when you asked.

40:32.156 --> 40:34.857
It was just because I'm... afraid.

40:34.859 --> 40:36.492
What are you afraid of?

40:36.494 --> 40:37.960
I don't know.

40:37.962 --> 40:40.629
Been on my own for a while. I'm used to it.

40:40.631 --> 40:44.033
But I don't want to be used to it anymore.

40:50.908 --> 40:52.574
- Okay, I have another idea.
- Okay.

40:52.576 --> 40:55.010
How about instead of you moving
in to my place,

40:55.012 --> 40:56.845
which will never feel like yours,

40:56.847 --> 40:59.080
we look for a new place...

40:59.082 --> 41:01.682
something that would be ours.

41:01.684 --> 41:03.684
That is a great idea.

41:03.686 --> 41:05.287
- Right?
- Yeah.

41:05.289 --> 41:06.922
Well, since I'm gonna be moving out,

41:06.924 --> 41:09.190
what do you say we go home
and wreck the place?

41:09.192 --> 41:10.425
Yeah.

41:25.007 --> 41:27.041
I'm sorry. I should have listened.

41:27.043 --> 41:29.076
I thought I could change your mind

41:29.078 --> 41:31.211
about the whole anti-birthday thing.

41:31.213 --> 41:32.780
You know what? I'm glad I wasn't alone,

41:32.782 --> 41:35.682
and I'm happy now, so thank you.

41:35.684 --> 41:39.486
Good. Well, you relax,
and I'm gonna start tidying up.

41:39.488 --> 41:40.854
No, you won't.

41:40.856 --> 41:42.156
I'll help.

41:42.158 --> 41:44.825
But first, a bottle of wine.
A couple of glasses, huh?

41:44.827 --> 41:46.827
Why not?

41:46.829 --> 41:49.229
Did you see Shahir dancing?

41:49.231 --> 41:52.966
- I did. He was incredible.
- I know.

41:52.968 --> 41:54.334
Whatever happened to your date?

41:54.336 --> 41:55.602
- Spencer?
- Yeah.

41:55.604 --> 41:58.037
He disappeared into thin air.

41:58.039 --> 41:59.339
Like they all do.

41:59.341 --> 42:01.140
Must be something wrong with him.

42:01.142 --> 42:02.576
I'm beginning to think maybe it's me.

42:02.578 --> 42:03.643
Mnh-mnh.

42:03.645 --> 42:05.779
Okay, do you have any more paper towels?

42:05.781 --> 42:07.380
Yes. Bathroom cupboard.

42:07.382 --> 42:08.448
I'll go get them.

42:08.450 --> 42:11.084
Okay.

42:11.086 --> 42:12.452
Oh!

42:12.454 --> 42:14.586
- - Oh!
- Whoa! Uh, whoa!

42:14.588 --> 42:16.688
Oh, my God.

42:16.690 --> 42:17.956
Oh, my God.

42:17.958 --> 42:20.925
Hey... Dr. Reid.

42:20.927 --> 42:22.494
Summer.

42:23.730 --> 42:25.464
We should probably go.

42:25.466 --> 42:27.099
Yeah, that would be a good idea.

42:27.101 --> 42:31.135
And, uh, take the pillow with you...

42:31.137 --> 42:33.571
please.

42:35.575 --> 42:38.676
So sorry.
