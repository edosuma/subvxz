00:45.405 --> 00:47.565
Anybody there?

00:56.574 --> 00:58.534
You're losing your mind, dear !

01:57.814 --> 02:00.334
I assume you've been fully briefed?
Yes, sir.

02:00.334 --> 02:03.574
Your job's to tighten up security
in every area of the ARC.

02:03.574 --> 02:07.094
As you may know, we've had a number
of unfortunate lapses recently.

02:07.094 --> 02:09.174
I'm aware of that.

02:09.174 --> 02:11.374
You're also aware
of the work we do here?

02:11.374 --> 02:13.974
You detect anomalies
and fight dinosaurs.

02:13.974 --> 02:15.934
When necessary.

02:16.974 --> 02:19.054
Correct. You don't sound surprised.

02:19.054 --> 02:21.774
I have extensive experience
in dinosaur handling, sir.

02:21.774 --> 02:24.454
I assumed that was why
I was picked for the job !

02:26.854 --> 02:29.174
I take it that's some sort of joke?
Yes, sir.

02:29.174 --> 02:31.894
A lot of people are sceptical
when they join us, Becker.

02:31.894 --> 02:33.534
They don't stay that way for long.

02:34.574 --> 02:36.614
And, in future, I'll do the jokes.

02:36.614 --> 02:38.574
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

02:41.174 --> 02:44.014
You'll be with a highly strung
and temperamental team

02:44.014 --> 02:47.494
of rank amateurs who just happen
to be brilliant at what they do.

02:47.494 --> 02:50.374
Your job's to stop them
getting themselves killed.

02:50.374 --> 02:52.814
No matter what they say,
what excuses they use,

02:52.814 --> 02:54.894
you and your men
will stick to them like glue.

02:55.974 --> 02:58.254
We can't afford
another Stephen Heart. Clear?

02:58.254 --> 02:59.934
Crystal clear, sir.

03:01.734 --> 03:03.694
Good luck.

03:05.054 --> 03:07.694
Oh, by the way.
Professor Cutter won't like you

03:07.694 --> 03:10.294
and he'll go out of his way to make
your job impossible.

03:11.334 --> 03:13.174
Try not to take it personally.

03:21.014 --> 03:24.054
And that's the story
of Rameses the second.

03:24.054 --> 03:26.694
Now, this...this is Anubis.

03:26.694 --> 03:29.054
The Egyptian god of embalming.

03:29.054 --> 03:31.134
Now, when you died...

03:31.134 --> 03:33.774
they'd pull your brains out
from inside your nose,

03:33.774 --> 03:35.334
using one of these.

03:35.334 --> 03:39.694
Then, Anubis would rip out...
your bleeding heart.

03:40.734 --> 03:42.694
Now, if you hadn't been very good...

03:43.734 --> 03:45.774
..the demon goddess Ammut...

03:45.774 --> 03:47.894
would eat it.

03:47.894 --> 03:50.174
And then you're doomed
to spend eternity...

03:51.214 --> 03:52.454
..in the underworld.

03:56.014 --> 03:58.214
Erm...well, the museum's closed now.

03:58.214 --> 04:01.254
But I hope you all had a great day.

04:02.294 --> 04:04.054
Thank you.

04:05.414 --> 04:07.854
Marion...
Whatever you want, the answer's no.

04:08.894 --> 04:11.374
That jacket is gorgeous. Is it new?

04:11.374 --> 04:15.134
See this? All these items
have got to be ticked off overnight.

04:15.134 --> 04:18.534
We've got three exhibitions to move,
redress two others.

04:18.534 --> 04:21.134
The Sun Cage is already prepped
for transportation.

04:21.134 --> 04:23.214
Well, that's...

04:23.214 --> 04:26.454
really good, cos the museum director
told me I had until opening time

04:26.454 --> 04:28.534
tomorrow to finish my work.

04:28.534 --> 04:31.534
Come on, Marion. I've got one
final section left to study.

04:31.534 --> 04:33.614
Right there.

04:33.614 --> 04:37.374
With respect, Sarah, the greatest
Egyptologists of the 20th century

04:37.374 --> 04:40.334
decoded those hieroglyphics
decades ago.

04:40.334 --> 04:42.774
And they were much
more qualified than you.

04:42.774 --> 04:45.654
And some of those translations
have never made sense.

04:45.654 --> 04:48.134
All I'm asking is to let me
check it out for myself.

04:48.134 --> 04:50.534
Sorry. This exhibition is closed.
I'm moving on.

04:55.054 --> 04:57.014
(Witch!)

05:06.894 --> 05:09.894
'Stephen!'

05:09.894 --> 05:12.894
'Stephen, open the door!'

05:12.894 --> 05:15.254
'Stephen? No, open the door!'

05:15.254 --> 05:16.894
'Open it!'

05:16.894 --> 05:18.414
Cutter?

05:19.734 --> 05:23.334
Don't you ever go home? You can't
take this personally, you know.

05:24.414 --> 05:26.934
No-one blames you.
For what?

05:26.934 --> 05:28.974
For what happened to Stephen.

05:28.974 --> 05:30.854
It wasn't your fault.

05:32.614 --> 05:34.854
Yeah, I know. It was Helen's.

05:34.854 --> 05:37.254
Then, why are you blaming yourself?

05:37.254 --> 05:39.894
Because I should have stopped her.
That's my job.

05:40.734 --> 05:42.694
But you can't change the past.

05:44.494 --> 05:46.574
Yeah.

05:46.574 --> 05:49.414
You don't know the half of it,
Claudia Brown !

05:50.814 --> 05:52.774
OK. I'm out of here.

05:56.374 --> 05:58.414
Do you want to get something to eat?

05:58.414 --> 06:00.374
I'm starving.

06:17.534 --> 06:19.494
What on earth...?

06:43.294 --> 06:45.494
Perfect timing !

06:48.494 --> 06:50.774
Yeah.
We've got another one.

06:50.774 --> 06:52.934
Where?
Meet me in the British Museum.

06:52.934 --> 06:54.774
OK.

06:55.814 --> 06:58.374
Connor! We've got a new one.

07:01.134 --> 07:02.814
Mm.

07:08.534 --> 07:10.454
We need to move.
I need some help, Rex.

07:12.014 --> 07:14.054
Rex.

07:14.054 --> 07:16.374
Breakfast.

07:25.534 --> 07:27.614
Oh... Oh!

07:27.614 --> 07:29.614
Eurgh!

07:29.614 --> 07:31.574
Rex.

07:33.014 --> 07:34.734
Morning, mate.

07:49.894 --> 07:52.614
Connor Temple, Abby Maitland...

07:52.614 --> 07:55.934
This is Captain Becker. He's here
to protect us, so do as he says.

07:58.894 --> 08:00.614
Unless I think he's wrong.

08:01.654 --> 08:02.694
This way.

08:17.054 --> 08:19.134
CONNOR: You know, when I was a kid,

08:19.134 --> 08:22.974
I used to think that all
the exhibits came to life at night.

08:22.974 --> 08:27.934
When I was about eight, I decided
to stay behind one night, find out.

08:29.574 --> 08:31.854
ABBY: What happened?

08:31.854 --> 08:33.614
Nothing...really.

08:34.693 --> 08:37.214
Apart from I got locked
in the toilet for three hours.

08:37.214 --> 08:39.254
It's not funny.

08:39.254 --> 08:41.174
When they found me,
I was hysterical.

08:42.254 --> 08:45.374
I've had a problem with...
museums ever since.

08:45.374 --> 08:47.854
Shouldn't you have
a problem with toilets?

08:47.854 --> 08:49.814
Got over that.

09:07.894 --> 09:09.854
It's an animal kill.

09:12.334 --> 09:14.934
It could be anywhere
in the museum by now.

09:32.484 --> 09:34.604
I really don't like this place.

09:56.724 --> 09:59.444
BECKER: Which way now?

10:02.044 --> 10:04.284
Go, go, go!

10:07.884 --> 10:09.924
CUTTER: Stay where you are!

10:09.924 --> 10:11.844
Stay where you are!

10:15.084 --> 10:16.964
It's all right.

10:18.124 --> 10:19.284
Who are you?

10:20.484 --> 10:22.524
Doc...Doctor Page.

10:22.524 --> 10:24.444
Who are you?

10:24.444 --> 10:25.764
I'm Nick Cutter.

10:27.444 --> 10:29.404
OK. Um...

10:30.844 --> 10:33.124
I'm...I'm guessing...

10:33.124 --> 10:35.964
you're some kind of...of thief.

10:35.964 --> 10:38.364
No. Actually, I'm a professor.

10:42.324 --> 10:44.684
I've never seen a professor
with a gun before.

10:44.684 --> 10:47.244
Yeah.
It's a pretty specialised field.

11:03.484 --> 11:05.444
Marion!

11:10.404 --> 11:12.364
CONNOR: Professor?

11:13.404 --> 11:15.124
Dr Page?

11:15.124 --> 11:17.004
BECKER: Move it!

11:30.644 --> 11:32.604
Dr Page!

12:03.444 --> 12:05.404
Who's there?

12:06.484 --> 12:08.484
Who's there?!

12:18.164 --> 12:20.004
Aargh!

12:31.844 --> 12:33.644
Aargh!

12:50.004 --> 12:52.044
Aargh!

13:09.844 --> 13:10.884
You OK?

13:13.564 --> 13:15.284
I'm guessing not.

13:15.284 --> 13:17.444
What did you see?

13:19.644 --> 13:21.684
Ammut.

13:21.684 --> 13:24.244
I saw...I saw the goddess Ammut.

13:26.884 --> 13:30.364
Look. I know what I saw. OK?
And...and it looked...

13:30.364 --> 13:33.164
It looked like that.
Look. I believe you saw something.

13:33.164 --> 13:36.964
I've seen things that confused me,
too. I just don't think it was Ammut.

13:39.564 --> 13:42.124
I've found tracks.
Biped and quadruped.

13:42.124 --> 13:45.284
It's heading south.
I've got to get back to the ARC.

13:45.284 --> 13:46.804
The ark?
Not that one.

13:46.804 --> 13:49.884
I'm gonna brief Lester.
Becker, can you secure the area?

13:51.564 --> 13:54.524
Connor? Stay and work out
what period the anomaly's linked to.

13:54.524 --> 13:58.004
And find out what Dr Page knows
about the Sun Cage.

13:58.004 --> 14:00.044
Abby? You're with me.

14:04.924 --> 14:06.884
I bet I can read your mind.

14:09.244 --> 14:11.684
You wanna know who we are,
what the ARC is,

14:11.684 --> 14:13.964
and what the big flickering thing
is behind me.

14:13.964 --> 14:16.004
Actually um...

14:16.004 --> 14:18.084
I was wondering why...

14:18.084 --> 14:20.604
an Egyptian demon
was trying to eat me.

14:22.164 --> 14:24.644
'Sir? It's Whitehall.

14:24.644 --> 14:26.564
I have Christine Johnson
on line one.'

14:30.164 --> 14:32.404
Christine.
What an unexpected pleasure.

14:32.404 --> 14:35.404
James.
How lovely to hear your voice.

14:35.404 --> 14:38.244
I thought you were running
the MI6 station in Jamaica.

14:38.244 --> 14:40.644
I'm back in London.
I missed the rain.

14:41.684 --> 14:43.084
Let's have lunch.

14:43.084 --> 14:45.164
It's a charming offer, Christine.

14:45.164 --> 14:47.644
Unfortunately, I am rather busy
just at the moment.

14:47.644 --> 14:49.884
I have some news for you.

14:49.884 --> 14:53.244
The minister has put me in charge
of military liaison with the ARC.

14:57.084 --> 14:59.124
He didn't say anything to me
about it.

14:59.124 --> 15:01.724
Oh, didn't he? I'm sure
there's an e-mail on its way.

15:01.724 --> 15:03.604
We need to meet for a briefing.

15:03.604 --> 15:06.004
'How does this morning sound?'

15:06.004 --> 15:08.084
'Like irritatingly bad timing.'

15:08.084 --> 15:10.244
I'd forgotten how funny you are,
James.

15:10.244 --> 15:12.404
I'll see you in an hour.
'Well, actually - '

15:12.404 --> 15:14.684
We've got a problem.

15:14.684 --> 15:16.924
So have I.
It's called Christine Johnson.

15:16.924 --> 15:18.884
A velociraptor,
but better dressed.

15:18.884 --> 15:21.324
James, a creature has escaped
through the anomaly.

15:21.324 --> 15:23.564
What is it?
We don't know.

15:23.564 --> 15:27.164
Can't you look its picture up in
your Big Book Of Dinosaurs (?) Where?

15:27.164 --> 15:29.724
We don't know.

15:29.724 --> 15:31.804
Morning rush hour.

15:31.804 --> 15:34.044
And a creature loose
on the streets of London.

15:34.044 --> 15:36.204
Oh, wonderful !
Cutter's tracking it now.

15:36.204 --> 15:38.284
We have the anomaly site secured.

15:38.284 --> 15:40.604
But there's...something else.
Yeah?

15:40.604 --> 15:43.964
There was an eyewitness.
Erm, a young woman at the museum.

15:43.964 --> 15:47.484
Well, you know. Have her shot
and dispose of her body discreetly.

15:48.524 --> 15:50.364
Just kidding.

16:28.324 --> 16:30.804
So, Dr Page. What do
these hieroglyphs refer to?

16:30.804 --> 16:32.884
That's what I've been...working on.

16:33.964 --> 16:37.124
But there are so many
unanswered questions.

16:37.124 --> 16:39.164
Key fragments that are missing.

16:39.164 --> 16:41.644
And I've been trying
to figure it all out.

16:41.644 --> 16:43.684
If Marion had let me finish...

16:43.684 --> 16:46.724
Ammut would have got me and not her.

16:46.724 --> 16:48.844
I'm sorry. She was your friend?

16:48.844 --> 16:50.924
Oh, no. Not at all.

16:50.924 --> 16:54.964
But, you know. Given a choice,
I wouldn't want her dead.

16:56.684 --> 16:58.724
Cutter!

16:58.724 --> 17:00.684
What is it?

17:07.044 --> 17:09.284
CONNOR: Right.
Let's see what we've got here.

17:28.684 --> 17:31.364
I didn't do it.
So, it just...fell off by itself.

17:32.404 --> 17:33.444
Yep.

17:34.484 --> 17:37.244
The Sun Cage...is cursed.

17:41.364 --> 17:43.764
Anyone who touches it is...is...

17:43.764 --> 17:45.244
doomed for life.

17:46.284 --> 17:48.084
Really?

17:49.164 --> 17:51.324
Marion was the last person
to touch that.

17:52.244 --> 17:54.364
The dead one?

17:59.924 --> 18:02.564
Should have told you that earlier,
right?

18:02.564 --> 18:04.524
Sorry about that. Bad luck.

18:04.524 --> 18:06.884
Bad luck.

18:18.964 --> 18:21.044
I've lost the tracks.

18:21.044 --> 18:23.364
We're going round in circles,
Cutter.

18:23.364 --> 18:25.404
Stephen would have known what to do.

18:29.484 --> 18:31.164
Sorry.

18:34.204 --> 18:36.284
Yo.
'Connor, it's me. What have we got?'

18:36.284 --> 18:40.044
I took a reading.
Whatever came through is at least
55 million years old.

18:40.044 --> 18:42.124
Eocene epoch.

18:42.124 --> 18:45.604
It's fast, strong, switches from two
legs to four and it's carnivorous.

18:45.604 --> 18:48.084
Search the databases,
profile me some creatures.

19:06.724 --> 19:09.604
Cutter...
We're heading south.

19:09.604 --> 19:11.684
'I think we've got him.'

19:11.684 --> 19:14.964
Tell him I'm on my way.
Action Man said he's coming.

19:41.524 --> 19:44.804
Hey! Er... What's your name?
Connor. My name's Connor.

19:44.804 --> 19:49.484
It was staring me in the face. These
hieroglyphs have been misunderstood.

19:49.484 --> 19:51.564
The most important section is wrong.

19:51.564 --> 19:54.844
This depicts a monument
on the west bank of the Nile.

19:54.844 --> 19:58.804
Amentet. With what appears to be
the sun rising behind it.

19:58.804 --> 20:02.884
Now, one of Ammut's names is
The Dweller In Amentet.

20:02.884 --> 20:05.244
And I think that this monument...

20:05.244 --> 20:07.084
is the one depicted here.

20:07.084 --> 20:10.324
Except...the sun doesn't rise
in the west.

20:11.404 --> 20:14.564
This...this hieroglyph
has been misinterpreted for years.

20:14.564 --> 20:16.604
This isn't the sun!

20:16.604 --> 20:18.644
It's an anomaly.

20:18.644 --> 20:19.884
Exactly.

20:19.884 --> 20:22.724
And the Egyptians called it
the Sun Cage because...

20:22.724 --> 20:26.044
they thought that the rays
of the sun were locked inside.

20:27.124 --> 20:29.084
What is this made of?
What stone is this?

20:29.084 --> 20:30.444
Magnetite.
Which is?

20:30.444 --> 20:33.724
Which is the most magnetic form
of stone...on earth.

20:39.524 --> 20:41.164
I wanna try something.

20:56.844 --> 20:58.644
Perfect!

20:58.644 --> 21:00.444
Everybody ready?

21:00.444 --> 21:02.244
Yeah.
Yeah.

21:02.244 --> 21:03.724
On my count.

21:04.764 --> 21:06.804
One...

21:06.804 --> 21:08.684
two...three.

21:28.244 --> 21:30.284
OK. Leave this. Back to the doors.

21:30.284 --> 21:32.364
Right. When the Sun Cage moved...

21:35.924 --> 21:38.604
..so did the anomaly.

21:38.604 --> 21:40.604
Is that unusual?
Very.

21:40.604 --> 21:42.204
Why?

21:42.204 --> 21:44.004
Why would it do that?

21:45.244 --> 21:48.324
That's what this final section
of the hieroglyph refers to.

21:48.324 --> 21:52.164
The Egyptians thought that the..
the anomaly was part of the sun.

21:52.164 --> 21:54.804
So, they built the cage
out of magnetite...

21:54.804 --> 21:56.844
as the only way
they could contain it.

21:56.844 --> 21:59.844
So, wherever the Sun Cage goes,
the anomaly goes too.

21:59.844 --> 22:01.844
Exactly.
Wow.

22:03.044 --> 22:04.524
That's huge.

22:04.524 --> 22:06.444
I mean, if it was -

22:08.604 --> 22:11.124
Connor!

22:11.124 --> 22:12.764
Don't pull that trigger!

22:14.124 --> 22:15.564
Throw it!

22:15.564 --> 22:17.804
It's got my belt!

22:17.804 --> 22:19.404
Ow!

22:31.124 --> 22:33.084
You nearly let it eat me!

22:34.124 --> 22:35.604
That cat is priceless.

22:35.604 --> 22:37.364
So am I !

22:41.204 --> 22:43.244
How many of those things are there?

22:43.244 --> 22:45.164
I don't know.

22:46.164 --> 22:48.164
Could be hundreds.

22:48.164 --> 22:50.804
We need to get this thing blocked up.

22:54.604 --> 22:56.644
There's no pulse.

22:56.644 --> 22:58.644
He's gone.

23:00.724 --> 23:02.884
BECKER: Professor.
What have we got here?

23:02.884 --> 23:04.484
Abby? What do you make of that?

23:08.564 --> 23:10.604
Crocodile tooth.

23:10.604 --> 23:13.084
The river.

23:45.026 --> 23:48.066
Crocodiles usually drag their victims
into water to finish them.

23:48.066 --> 23:50.106
So, why did this croc
attack on land?

23:50.106 --> 23:51.706
Why is it walking on two legs?

23:53.866 --> 23:56.826
CONNOR: Come on, come on!
What are you?

23:56.826 --> 23:59.746
Eocene epoch,
looked like a crocodile. Erm...

24:02.543 --> 24:03.623
Cutter.

24:03.623 --> 24:07.583
Yep. I am just narrowing down the
list of creatures from that era now.

24:07.583 --> 24:10.103
I think I know
where you're gonna find it.

24:10.103 --> 24:12.183
Just give me a minute. Oh, yeah.

24:12.183 --> 24:14.423
Yeah. This is definitely the guy.
Hang on.

24:14.423 --> 24:17.823
His name is...
'Pristichampsus.' Bingo.

24:17.823 --> 24:21.023
Yep... Looks like the one.

24:22.983 --> 24:26.143
All right. So, it's in the Thames.
But it won't be for long.

24:26.143 --> 24:28.503
It's gonna come ashore,
looking for warmth.

24:29.903 --> 24:31.463
And food !

24:46.423 --> 24:48.383
BLEEP

24:50.343 --> 24:52.103
James.

24:52.103 --> 24:54.703
You're very well guarded.
It's fine.

24:54.703 --> 24:56.743
Let him pass.

24:56.743 --> 24:59.023
I'm sorry. I should have thought.

24:59.023 --> 25:01.183
Told them to whisk you
straight through.

25:01.183 --> 25:03.143
Thank you for coming.

25:05.143 --> 25:07.183
I like your suit.

25:07.183 --> 25:08.423
Italian?

25:08.423 --> 25:10.023
Yes. Yep.

25:10.023 --> 25:12.703
It looks great on you.
Matches your eyes.

25:12.703 --> 25:14.743
Shall we?

25:14.743 --> 25:15.823
Yep.

25:15.823 --> 25:19.183
The minister has asked me to
offer you support in any way I can.

25:19.183 --> 25:21.263
What kind of support?
You tell me.

25:22.303 --> 25:24.463
I think we're managing pretty well.

25:24.463 --> 25:26.783
I have to say -
and this isn't my own opinion -

25:26.783 --> 25:28.983
but that's not
the general perception.

25:28.983 --> 25:31.463
There's a feeling
that perhaps the...

25:31.463 --> 25:34.303
situation is too extreme
for you to handle alone.

25:34.303 --> 25:36.583
Well, that perception
would be entirely wrong.

25:37.783 --> 25:41.263
Even so. The minister is keen we
allow the military a greater role.

25:41.263 --> 25:43.983
After all, we are on the same side.

25:43.983 --> 25:47.143
I won't tolerate any interference.
Perish the thought, James.

25:47.143 --> 25:49.903
I can't tell you how much
I admire your work. Can't you?

25:49.903 --> 25:51.983
Oh, go on. Give it a go !

25:51.983 --> 25:56.223
Maybe later. First, I need briefing
on some operational protocols.

25:56.223 --> 25:59.783
I'm so sorry, James. We're going to
have to reschedule. Let's do dinner.

26:01.663 --> 26:03.703
I beg your pardon?
Claire.

26:03.703 --> 26:06.503
Would you mind escorting this
gentleman from the building?

26:06.503 --> 26:09.063
Follow me.
Well, actually...erm...

26:17.263 --> 26:20.023
I told you not to come back here
without it. What happened?

26:20.023 --> 26:22.183
It was a suicide mission.

26:27.503 --> 26:29.543
We got it.

26:29.543 --> 26:31.223
Now let's get out of here.

27:16.463 --> 27:18.703
Go on! Get out!

27:24.783 --> 27:25.903
Come on!

27:35.303 --> 27:37.223
We had to leave it behind.

27:37.223 --> 27:39.303
You had one objective, Captain.

27:39.303 --> 27:41.623
You have failed.
With respect, ma'am,

27:41.623 --> 27:43.783
my men died
trying to find that thing.

27:43.783 --> 27:46.503
With respect, Captain,
that is your responsibility.

27:46.503 --> 27:48.183
I want that artefact!

27:56.343 --> 27:58.423
If it's been living in Egypt...

27:58.423 --> 28:01.823
the Thames will be much colder
than what it's used to.

28:01.823 --> 28:04.423
It'll be looking to get out
pretty soon.

28:11.183 --> 28:12.743
Make that right now.

28:31.463 --> 28:34.063
It's too slow.
It's all taking too much time.

28:35.143 --> 28:38.983
We need this barricade up before
any more creatures can come through.

28:38.983 --> 28:40.943
What about the forklift?

28:44.143 --> 28:45.943
Forklift.

28:46.983 --> 28:48.743
Why didn't you say that before?

28:50.343 --> 28:53.623
Connor, I...I've been attacked
by prehistoric monsters.

28:53.623 --> 28:56.263
I'm...I'm staring at a gateway
to a distant past.

28:57.303 --> 28:59.143
I really wasn't thinking 'forklift'.

29:01.023 --> 29:03.983
Shoot it!

29:03.983 --> 29:05.423
Keep shooting it!

29:06.943 --> 29:08.983
Connor, do something!

29:16.423 --> 29:17.463
Connor!

29:29.863 --> 29:31.943
That's never happened before.

29:31.943 --> 29:34.703
What?
That.

29:46.863 --> 29:50.743
Usually, the magnetic pull sucks
anything metallic straight through.

29:50.743 --> 29:53.943
It's the electric current.
It must have done something to it.

29:58.863 --> 30:00.903
OK. I'll figure it out later.

30:00.903 --> 30:02.823
We need to get these boxes back up!

30:43.743 --> 30:46.503
If your first tranquiliser dart
doesn't floor this thing,

30:46.503 --> 30:48.823
we have no option
but to use live rounds.

30:48.823 --> 30:50.903
OK, Professor?

30:50.903 --> 30:53.623
Please - tell me
we haven't lost it again.

30:55.823 --> 30:57.463
Apparently not.

31:28.663 --> 31:30.623
Where is it?

31:44.783 --> 31:46.263
Upstairs?

31:47.903 --> 31:49.943
Yeah.
We need to get these people out.

31:49.943 --> 31:53.503
Ladies and gentlemen, can you follow
us, for your own safety? Thank you.

32:00.943 --> 32:03.263
Ladies and gentlemen,
if you'd just follow me.

32:03.263 --> 32:05.743
I promise you,
there's nothing to worry about.

32:05.743 --> 32:08.623
You know how these charity fun runs
can go way out of control.

32:42.623 --> 32:44.783
Go on, go on!
Abby?!

32:45.823 --> 32:48.023
For God's sake, shoot it!

32:55.343 --> 32:57.303
Sorry.

33:12.983 --> 33:14.543
Hey!

33:14.543 --> 33:15.863
Cutter!

33:18.583 --> 33:19.743
Hey!

33:29.783 --> 33:31.463
It's OK, it's OK.

33:31.463 --> 33:33.383
Come, come, come.

33:48.583 --> 33:51.103
No, just hang on. You'll be fine.

33:52.143 --> 33:54.463
Oh, Cutter!

34:05.863 --> 34:07.863
Are you OK?
Yes.

34:07.863 --> 34:10.023
Just enjoying the view.

34:14.263 --> 34:17.902
Seems it's heading for the river.
It probably wants to go home.

34:32.393 --> 34:34.873
OK. Nothing...
is getting through there.

34:36.753 --> 34:38.672
It's Cutter.

34:39.953 --> 34:42.913
Hello. 'Looks like Pristichampsus
is heading your way.'

34:42.913 --> 34:44.993
'So, make sure
it can get to the anomaly.'

34:49.672 --> 34:52.833
I am SO...cursed.

34:55.313 --> 34:57.112
Everything on this side has to go.

34:58.153 --> 34:59.513
Completely.

35:05.073 --> 35:08.913
And these two. It's following its own
scent. Coming through those doors.

35:12.153 --> 35:13.713
We need to get that open.

35:20.553 --> 35:21.713
Last few.

35:33.913 --> 35:35.433
Connor, I can't see it.

35:41.313 --> 35:45.993
Oh, you've got to be kidding me!
It's come through the other door.

35:52.713 --> 35:54.553
Connor! Out of the way!

36:00.353 --> 36:03.353
Guys...please, just get it back
through the anomaly.

36:03.353 --> 36:05.513
Don't...shoot it.

36:05.513 --> 36:07.313
It's my job to keep you alive.

36:07.313 --> 36:10.273
Aargh! I'm too young to die.

36:12.793 --> 36:15.313
It's injured. It wants to go home.

36:15.313 --> 36:17.433
I don't know how long I can hold on,
Cutter.

36:17.433 --> 36:18.393
Bow!

36:19.393 --> 36:21.393
What?
Bow down.

36:21.393 --> 36:23.473
What are you talking about?

36:23.473 --> 36:27.193
This creature is...is used to
being treated like a god.

36:27.193 --> 36:30.393
They would have bowed
as a sign of respect.

36:30.393 --> 36:32.553
If it doesn't think
we're a threat...

36:32.553 --> 36:34.553
it might not attack.

36:35.593 --> 36:37.673
I'm not bowing.

36:37.673 --> 36:39.593
Get down on the floor.
What?

36:39.593 --> 36:41.433
Do it.

36:41.433 --> 36:43.993
Keep the gun handy.

37:24.033 --> 37:26.073
Aargh!

37:26.073 --> 37:27.913
Ow!

37:27.913 --> 37:29.513
Nice call.

37:30.553 --> 37:31.793
(Thanks.)

37:35.153 --> 37:37.873
That's gotta be
the end of the curse now. Right?

37:38.913 --> 37:40.633
Here's hoping.

37:42.073 --> 37:44.073
The curse?

37:46.873 --> 37:48.553
(I made it up.)

37:48.553 --> 37:51.633
Don't tell him yet.
Course not.

37:54.273 --> 37:56.433
All right?
Oh, yeah. Brilliant !

37:58.753 --> 38:01.513
You know, I think Stephen
might have liked this one.

38:01.513 --> 38:04.433
I think he might have liked
our Dr Page even better !

38:05.873 --> 38:09.593
I want you to set up a research
programme into magnetite.

38:09.593 --> 38:11.673
Its effect on anomalies,

38:11.673 --> 38:15.233
how electricity
can be used to...lock 'em.

38:15.233 --> 38:16.873
Cool.

38:22.753 --> 38:26.113
Please tell me you got
that bad-tempered reptile

38:26.113 --> 38:27.873
back in his box.

38:29.393 --> 38:32.033
Yep.
Excellent.

38:32.033 --> 38:33.833
James Lester.

38:33.833 --> 38:35.593
Home Office.

38:35.593 --> 38:37.673
This is a government facility?

38:37.673 --> 38:39.953
What did you think it was?
The circus?

38:42.073 --> 38:44.273
You're Sarah Page.

38:44.273 --> 38:46.313
Dr Page.

38:46.313 --> 38:48.433
Yes. PhD in Egyptology...

38:48.433 --> 38:50.233
promising academic career,

38:50.233 --> 38:53.273
veteran of archaeological digs
all over the Middle East.

38:53.273 --> 38:56.393
Now you're giving lectures
to kiddies at the museum.

38:58.073 --> 39:01.553
How did that happen?
Just not very good at taking orders.

39:03.753 --> 39:05.833
You should fit right in, then.

39:07.793 --> 39:09.753
I've got a file?
Everyone's got a file.

39:10.833 --> 39:13.513
Dr Page, you can't say anything
about what you saw today.

39:13.513 --> 39:15.153
Do I need to repeat myself?

39:15.153 --> 39:17.633
Or should I have you arrested
for your own protection?

39:22.433 --> 39:24.753
Might need that.

39:28.993 --> 39:31.073
Is he always that rude?

39:31.073 --> 39:33.953
By his standards...he was actually
being pretty nice.

39:33.953 --> 39:37.153
So, this is what you do here, is it?
You um...

39:37.153 --> 39:40.193
You deal with these anomalies
as and when they occur.

39:41.233 --> 39:43.353
This is what we do.

39:43.353 --> 39:47.353
I can't believe I saw Ammut.
Well, what the Egyptians
thought was Ammut.

39:47.353 --> 39:49.433
A genuine living legend.

39:51.593 --> 39:54.273
Legends.

39:54.273 --> 39:55.393
Yes!

39:57.233 --> 39:59.393
If...anomalies have appeared
in the past,

39:59.393 --> 40:01.553
and they have,

40:01.553 --> 40:05.313
is Pristichampsus was sunning itself
by the Nile 3,000 years ago,

40:05.313 --> 40:07.673
that's the stuff of legend.

40:07.673 --> 40:10.073
Anything that seems out of place,
out of time,

40:10.073 --> 40:11.633
like...
Like er...

40:11.633 --> 40:13.993
Like Chimera. Pegasus.

40:13.993 --> 40:16.233
The yeti.
The hydra. Kraken.

40:16.233 --> 40:18.273
I've been looking at this all wrong.

40:18.273 --> 40:20.393
I've been thinking two-dimensionally.

40:24.273 --> 40:26.833
How much do you know
about mythological beasts?

40:26.833 --> 40:30.393
Well, erm...my thesis on it
is in the British Library.

40:31.713 --> 40:35.153
She stays.
Do I get a say in any of this?

40:35.153 --> 40:37.193
Yes. Yes, of course.
I would like you

40:37.193 --> 40:40.793
to join us here at
the Anomaly Research Centre.

40:40.793 --> 40:43.433
I want you working on the source
of all the great myths.

40:43.433 --> 40:45.513
Where they were first spotted,
when, by whom.

40:46.553 --> 40:48.073
Can you find a pattern?

40:51.393 --> 40:53.593
Or you can go back
to lecturing schoolkids.

40:54.633 --> 40:56.233
Your choice.

41:05.033 --> 41:07.713
OK... I'm in.

41:07.713 --> 41:09.833
Great news. I feel safer already.

41:09.833 --> 41:11.953
What do we do about the Sun Cage?

41:11.953 --> 41:15.993
Well, the anomaly's closed. Might
not open for 3,000 years - if ever.

41:15.993 --> 41:18.073
Yeah. But it's still a risk.

41:18.073 --> 41:20.433
It can't be on public display
any more.

41:20.433 --> 41:22.833
Happily...

41:22.833 --> 41:24.793
that's not our decision to make.

41:25.753 --> 41:28.673
The Culture Minister tells me
the exhibition's moving on.

42:17.273 --> 42:19.233
This'll do.

42:20.793 --> 42:24.113
Here. Put that somewhere safe
until I work out what it is.

42:36.153 --> 42:37.793
Now let's get out of here.

42:48.433 --> 42:50.473
Come on, move!

42:50.473 --> 42:52.793
Get out!

43:22.513 --> 43:24.513
It's a nice place, isn't it?

43:24.513 --> 43:26.433
Officer...?
Detective Constable Quinn.

43:30.033 --> 43:31.233
Brian.

43:36.353 --> 43:37.633
Get down! Now!

43:39.513 --> 43:40.913
Aargh!

43:41.305 --> 43:47.659
