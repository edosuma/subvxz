00:01.540 --> 00:04.120
Previously on "How to Get Away
With Murder"...

00:04.120 --> 00:05.330
Connor: Tell him that
I'll get his mom asylum.

00:05.330 --> 00:06.880
Your position at
the District Attorney's office

00:06.880 --> 00:08.460
is terminated,
effective immediately.

00:08.460 --> 00:10.040
It's for
a safe deposit box.

00:10.040 --> 00:11.620
Only one other person
has access.

00:11.620 --> 00:12.880
Annalise: It's Wes.

00:12.880 --> 00:14.540
...who the last person
to access this was?

00:14.540 --> 00:16.000
Laurel Castillo.
Three days ago.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.080
Vivian's talking
to the FBI.

00:18.080 --> 00:19.380
What do you want
from me, Annalise?

00:19.380 --> 00:21.460
Simple. Take your son
and go away.

00:21.460 --> 00:22.580
So you're a killer now?

00:22.580 --> 00:23.880
What?
Paul.

00:23.880 --> 00:24.790
My father's dead.

00:24.790 --> 00:26.460
He died in prison
last year.

00:26.460 --> 00:28.420
I could have met him
if you'd told me.

00:28.420 --> 00:30.620
And it's your fault! I hate you!

00:30.620 --> 00:32.920
Your fingerprints match those
on the murder weapon.

00:32.920 --> 00:34.000
I want my lawyer.

00:41.380 --> 00:42.920
Good morning, class.

00:42.920 --> 00:44.670
My name is Michaela Pratt --

00:44.670 --> 00:47.420
Professor Pratt for the duration
of our new case.

00:47.420 --> 00:50.750
Today's client -- my client --
Brandi Greene.

00:50.750 --> 00:52.620
Wait, wait, wait. We're supposed
to earn this case.

00:52.620 --> 00:53.960
I have like
a thousand pitches.

00:53.960 --> 00:55.380
Ms. Pratt did earn it.

00:55.380 --> 00:57.080
When?
Annalise: When I decided,

00:57.080 --> 00:58.580
just like I can decide
to rescind my offer

00:58.580 --> 00:59.960
to let you
in this clinic.

00:59.960 --> 01:02.210
Now, since you've all supposedly
read the case file...

01:02.210 --> 01:04.080
Translation --
she guilt-tripped Annalise

01:04.080 --> 01:05.500
for not telling her
about her dead dad.

01:05.500 --> 01:07.620
Yeah, well,
my dad's dead, too.

01:07.620 --> 01:09.580
Brandi is accused
of helping her husband, Troy,

01:09.580 --> 01:11.880
rob $5,000
from a cash lender.

01:11.880 --> 01:14.330
In the subsequent car chase,
Brandi's husband, Troy,

01:14.330 --> 01:18.670
was shot...and killed...
by a police officer.

01:18.670 --> 01:21.290
As a result, the prosecution
is charging Brandi

01:21.290 --> 01:23.420
with the following.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.620
We wanted to open
a food truck.

01:26.620 --> 01:28.880
We asked Troy's aunt
for money.
What about a bank?

01:28.880 --> 01:30.420
How do you think Troy
came up with the idea

01:30.420 --> 01:32.210
to rob the Check-n-Hurry
in the first place?

01:32.210 --> 01:33.670
They turned us down
even after we agreed

01:33.670 --> 01:35.120
to pay
like 300% interest.

01:35.120 --> 01:37.500
Money is god in this country.
We all know that.

01:37.500 --> 01:40.670
As such, I'll pay each of you
20 Pratt Dollars

01:40.670 --> 01:43.380
for every idea that eliminates
one of these charges.

01:43.380 --> 01:46.580
First one to 100 gets
to be my second chair.

01:46.580 --> 01:48.330
Any takers? Peyton.

01:48.330 --> 01:50.210
Go after
the trespassing charge.

01:50.210 --> 01:51.830
The security cameras
only show Troy

01:51.830 --> 01:53.830
going into the Check-n-Hurry,
not Brandi.

01:53.830 --> 01:55.540
Brandi: Troy made me stay
in the car.

01:55.540 --> 01:57.120
Only took him a few minutes
before he came running out.

01:57.120 --> 01:58.460
We thought we made it.

01:58.460 --> 01:59.620
Mr. Walsh.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.960
A "resisting arrest" charge
requires the accused

02:01.960 --> 02:04.000
to create
risk of bodily injury,

02:04.000 --> 02:05.460
but Brandi
was literally clutching

02:05.460 --> 02:07.920
her dead husband's head
at the time of her arrest.

02:07.920 --> 02:09.290
That's not resisting.
That's grieving.

02:09.290 --> 02:11.920
The cop car came out of nowhere,
forced us off the road

02:11.920 --> 02:13.670
without even giving Troy
a chance to pull over.

02:13.670 --> 02:15.330
So, you were ready
to surrender?

02:15.330 --> 02:16.960
Eliminate possession
of a deadly weapon.

02:16.960 --> 02:18.620
The police said they found
a knife on Brandi.

02:18.620 --> 02:19.790
The knife
was a nail file.

02:19.790 --> 02:21.500
There's no crime
in staying flossy.

02:21.500 --> 02:23.880
Please. Like I'd ever need
to carry a weapon.

02:23.880 --> 02:26.580
If a bitch comes to me, I just
take her out with my fists.

02:26.580 --> 02:28.540
Okay, money's running out.
Come on, people. Let's go.

02:28.540 --> 02:30.380
I want all these charges
eliminated from the board.

02:30.380 --> 02:32.750
The case against her
is entirely circumstantial.

02:32.750 --> 02:35.250
She never provided advice,
assistance, supplies.

02:35.250 --> 02:36.580
If there's no intent,
there's no burglary.

02:36.580 --> 02:40.120
Her culpability is insufficient
to prove complicity.

02:40.120 --> 02:42.080
That's 100 Pratt Dollars.
I did it!

02:42.080 --> 02:43.210
I'm second chair!

02:43.210 --> 02:45.170
Oh. Not true.

02:45.170 --> 02:46.620
First you need to pay me
an additional

02:46.620 --> 02:50.210
$100,000 in...restitution!

02:50.210 --> 02:51.960
What the hell's
restitution?

02:51.960 --> 02:54.170
What the court makes you pay
to compensate the victims.

02:54.170 --> 02:56.500
My husband died.
He's the victim.
As are you.

02:56.500 --> 02:58.710
But they are charging you
for the safe Troy cracked,

02:58.710 --> 02:59.960
the cell store damage,

02:59.960 --> 03:01.540
damage to the officer's
patrol car,

03:01.540 --> 03:03.000
the officer's ER bill,
therapy.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.210
What about my therapy?

03:04.210 --> 03:07.040
The grand total
is $102,085.

03:08.920 --> 03:09.830
This isn't fair.

03:09.830 --> 03:11.670
Oh, you think
our justice system is?

03:11.670 --> 03:13.170
Poor people pay
on every level.

03:13.170 --> 03:14.750
I'm not
letting that happen.

03:14.750 --> 03:16.170
I already told Brandi.

03:16.170 --> 03:18.000
You're not
gonna pay a cent.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.500
What?

03:19.500 --> 03:22.120
I'm gonna get the DA
to drop every single dollar

03:22.120 --> 03:23.920
of that restitution.

03:23.920 --> 03:25.540
Asher:
There's no way the prosecution's
gonna agree to that.

03:25.540 --> 03:28.670
Maybe if you were Brandi's
lawyer, but it me.

03:28.670 --> 03:31.080
And since none of you
were bold enough

03:31.080 --> 03:33.920
to suggest
dropping the restitution,

03:33.920 --> 03:35.210
I don't need a second chair.

03:35.210 --> 03:36.540
-Objection!
-Boo! You're the worst.

03:41.500 --> 03:43.540
Brandi's plea hearing
is at noon today.

03:43.540 --> 03:45.210
Come watch me slay.

03:49.920 --> 03:52.040
Next time you want to tell
everyone I'm a killer,

03:52.040 --> 03:53.210
say it to my face.

03:53.210 --> 03:54.790
It wasn't me.
It was Asher.

03:54.790 --> 03:56.540
It's not a decision
I regret.

03:56.540 --> 03:58.960
You kill a guy,
you gotta pay the price.

03:58.960 --> 04:00.790
I didn't kill anyone.
Annalise: Quiet.

04:00.790 --> 04:02.960
You want your problems
to go away?

04:02.960 --> 04:04.670
Take your ass
back to UVA.

04:04.670 --> 04:06.120
Let's go.

04:07.460 --> 04:08.710
Hey.

04:08.710 --> 04:10.170
I have to focus
on my case.

04:12.460 --> 04:14.080
It's over, boo-boo.

04:14.080 --> 04:17.170
Pack your knives
and go home.

04:24.420 --> 04:27.580
Put me on criminal cases,
litigation, international.

04:28.960 --> 04:30.210
And obviously,
I know how to work well

04:30.210 --> 04:31.710
with big
personalities.

04:31.710 --> 04:33.000
So if you have
a difficult partner

04:33.000 --> 04:34.290
that needs a second,

04:34.290 --> 04:35.790
I'm your lawyer.

04:35.790 --> 04:37.120
Nate send you here?

04:37.120 --> 04:38.670
Hmm?

04:38.670 --> 04:41.040
He accused me of being involved
in Emmett's death.

04:41.040 --> 04:42.830
You his spy?

04:42.830 --> 04:45.790
No one knows I'm here,
even Annalise.

04:45.790 --> 04:48.500
Why?
The only reason
I want you to hire me

04:48.500 --> 04:50.830
is because you know I can be
an asset to this firm.

04:50.830 --> 04:53.790
So, not because
you got fired from the DA's?

04:53.790 --> 04:56.290
I left the DA's

04:56.290 --> 04:59.000
because of everything
that happened with Ron.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.330
I needed a fresh start,

05:00.330 --> 05:02.210
as you can imagine.

05:02.210 --> 05:03.710
Connor Walsh
is on the line.

05:03.710 --> 05:06.540
He says it's urgent.

05:06.540 --> 05:08.880
We can make it a trial basis.
No pressure.

05:10.420 --> 05:12.420
Sadly, my budget's
all spent for the year.

05:14.540 --> 05:16.250
Thanks for thinking of us,
though.

05:38.420 --> 05:39.250
What now?

05:39.250 --> 05:40.420
Marisol's not coming.

05:40.420 --> 05:42.000
Why?

05:42.000 --> 05:44.830
Her boss said he'd fire her
if she took the day off.

05:44.830 --> 05:47.500
Hector's pretty upset.

05:47.500 --> 05:48.500
Okay.

05:48.500 --> 05:49.620
Drive to Maryland.

05:49.620 --> 05:50.920
Get her to sign
those papers.

05:50.920 --> 05:52.830
Put me on with Hector.

05:52.830 --> 05:54.330
Hector.

05:54.330 --> 05:56.170
Mama?

05:56.170 --> 05:57.750
No, Hectorcito, es Tegan.

05:57.750 --> 06:00.580
Tu mamà estarà
allí muy pronto.

06:12.920 --> 06:15.500
Hey.
Save the sexting for later.

06:15.500 --> 06:16.830
Just 'cause we're gay

06:16.830 --> 06:18.380
doesn't mean
we're obsessed with sex.

06:18.380 --> 06:19.380
Really?

06:19.380 --> 06:20.830
I am,
but that's not why I'm here.

06:20.830 --> 06:22.670
You sure? I could probably
help you out with that.

06:22.670 --> 06:24.040
Shut up and listen.

06:24.040 --> 06:26.420
First, no one can know
what I'm about to tell you.

06:26.420 --> 06:29.750
Swear you won't tell Connor,
Michaela -- nobody.

06:29.750 --> 06:31.420
Oh, God.

06:33.080 --> 06:34.620
Okay.

06:34.620 --> 06:36.380
Laurel had
a safe deposit box.

06:36.380 --> 06:37.920
I found a way in,
but she cleaned it out.

06:37.920 --> 06:39.080
Are you sure it was her?
Yes.

06:39.080 --> 06:41.170
How?
Because I found her.

06:43.380 --> 06:46.540
It's from a street camera
outside the bank.

06:46.540 --> 06:48.040
It's her.

06:56.120 --> 06:58.620
ADA Richt, I understand you've
come to a plea agreement

06:58.620 --> 07:00.330
with the defense.
Yes, Your Honor.

07:00.330 --> 07:02.750
Three years' incarceration
and restitution.

07:02.750 --> 07:05.830
Counsel for Ms. Greene,
do you agree to these terms?

07:05.830 --> 07:06.750
Michaela: No, Your Honor.

07:06.750 --> 07:07.880
While we accept
the three years,

07:07.880 --> 07:09.500
we require the restitution
be waived.

07:09.500 --> 07:10.580
Your Honor,
the defense should have

07:10.580 --> 07:12.250
informed us
of this earlier.

07:12.250 --> 07:14.000
The prosecution knows
that game-time decisions

07:14.000 --> 07:15.290
are a part
of the game.

07:15.290 --> 07:16.830
On what grounds
are you requesting

07:16.830 --> 07:18.170
this waiver, Ms. Pratt?

07:18.170 --> 07:20.120
The restitution's punitive
under the 8th amendment,

07:20.120 --> 07:21.540
unless the whole point
is to keep my client

07:21.540 --> 07:23.540
living below the poverty line
her entire life.

07:23.540 --> 07:24.580
Get it, girl.

07:24.580 --> 07:25.880
Not to mention
the 7th amendment

07:25.880 --> 07:28.290
forbids assessing
any unliquidated damages

07:28.290 --> 07:30.000
against defendants
without a jury.
What are you doing here?

07:30.000 --> 07:31.250
You speak so highly
of Annalise.

07:31.250 --> 07:32.880
I want to see
what all the hype's about.

07:32.880 --> 07:35.540
Asher Millstone.
Moms love me.

07:35.540 --> 07:38.500
The prosecution is not only
over-charging my client

07:38.500 --> 07:39.960
for the cost of the
Check-n-Hurry safe --

07:39.960 --> 07:41.250
The safe her
husband destroyed.

07:41.250 --> 07:42.790
...They also want her to pay
for the counseling

07:42.790 --> 07:45.670
of the officer who shot
and killed her husband.

07:45.670 --> 07:48.540
That charge does feel
out of bounds, Mr. Richt.

07:48.540 --> 07:49.460
Okay.

07:49.460 --> 07:50.880
The Commonwealth agrees

07:50.880 --> 07:52.750
to reduce restitution
to $80,000.

07:52.750 --> 07:54.500
Knock off another $80,000,
and we have a deal.

07:54.500 --> 07:57.120
$70,000.
Again,
zero dollars is our ask.

07:57.120 --> 07:59.120
$60,000. Final offer.

07:59.120 --> 08:00.250
Take the win.

08:00.250 --> 08:01.380
I can get them lower,
just like

08:01.380 --> 08:02.460
I got this case off you.

08:02.460 --> 08:03.500
You're not negotiating
for yourself.

08:03.500 --> 08:04.460
Consult your client.

08:06.540 --> 08:07.830
Let it ride.

08:09.880 --> 08:12.080
Do you.

08:12.080 --> 08:14.330
Michaela: Your Honor,
unless the restitution
is dropped to zero,

08:14.330 --> 08:16.750
we have no choice
but to reject the plea offer

08:16.750 --> 08:17.880
and take this to trial,

08:17.880 --> 08:19.790
where we will win.

08:19.790 --> 08:21.290
Judge Nanjani:
Mr. Richt?

08:21.290 --> 08:22.500
Does the Commonwealth
have a response?

08:22.500 --> 08:23.580
Yes.

08:23.580 --> 08:24.880
We withdraw
our current plea offer.

08:24.880 --> 08:26.080
Judge,
let's take a recess.

08:26.080 --> 08:27.290
We'd also like to add
an additional charge

08:27.290 --> 08:28.580
of felony murder.

08:28.580 --> 08:30.170
Objection!
Due process!
Vindictive prosecution!

08:30.170 --> 08:31.420
Murder?
I didn't kill no one.

08:31.420 --> 08:32.620
Troy Greene died
in the midst of a felony

08:32.620 --> 08:34.540
the defendant was ready
to plead guilty to.

08:34.540 --> 08:36.250
Troy died because some cop
shot him in the head.

08:36.250 --> 08:37.500
Judge,
this is a retaliatory charge!

08:37.500 --> 08:39.170
I watched him die.
He bled out in my lap.

08:39.170 --> 08:41.710
Quiet, everyone.
Let's reconvene tomorrow.

08:41.710 --> 08:44.000
I will hear
both of your arguments,

08:44.000 --> 08:47.620
and I will determine whether the
felony murder charge is valid.

08:47.620 --> 08:49.750
The judge won't let that murder
charge go through, I promise.

08:49.750 --> 08:51.580
Just like you promised I
wouldn't have to pay that money.

08:51.580 --> 08:52.880
And I was winning.

08:52.880 --> 08:54.250
They only tacked on
this new charge to save face.

08:54.250 --> 08:55.620
Yeah, 'cause you went too hard
at them, you dumb bitch!

08:55.620 --> 08:57.960
Hey. Ms. Pratt is the only thing
standing between you

08:57.960 --> 08:59.960
and a life in prison.

08:59.960 --> 09:01.120
Trust her.

09:02.460 --> 09:04.380
Alright.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.120
Professor Keating.

09:08.120 --> 09:10.250
I -- You're going?

09:10.250 --> 09:12.080
You're the one
who wanted to let it ride.

09:12.080 --> 09:13.500
Now it's on you
to fix it.

09:21.580 --> 09:23.620
Ivy League tuition,
and that's what you're teaching

09:23.620 --> 09:24.960
these kids
to do in court?

09:24.960 --> 09:26.750
I must be pretty good
because I got your son off

09:26.750 --> 09:28.710
after the FBI charged him
with terrorism.

09:30.790 --> 09:32.080
Gabriel didn't
tell you that, huh?

09:32.080 --> 09:33.670
He's got
quite a rap sheet.

09:33.670 --> 09:36.500
Look, I want the same thing
you want here --

09:36.500 --> 09:37.710
for my son
to come home.

09:37.710 --> 09:39.250
I just need your help
convincing him.

09:39.250 --> 09:40.710
I'm done
helping your son.

09:40.710 --> 09:42.250
I know.

09:42.250 --> 09:45.500
But Gabriel's all I got.
Please.

09:45.500 --> 09:47.080
You of all people know

09:47.080 --> 09:48.960
what it feels like
to lose your child.

09:55.420 --> 09:56.790
Sam told me.

09:58.620 --> 10:00.620
We spoke on the phone
a few weeks after it happened.

10:04.500 --> 10:07.960
Your son's alive.

10:07.960 --> 10:10.710
No way in hell
do you know my pain.

10:35.290 --> 10:37.580
You couldn't wait
to go back to her!

10:37.580 --> 10:39.290
Why?! You blame me?!

10:39.290 --> 10:41.000
It wasn't my fault, Sam!

10:41.000 --> 10:42.120
I wanted him!

10:42.120 --> 10:43.750
I loved him!
I loved him!

10:43.750 --> 10:47.120
I loved him! I loved him!
I loved him!

10:47.120 --> 10:48.710
I loved him!

10:58.540 --> 11:00.420
Oh, I loved him.

11:03.710 --> 11:05.790
I loved him.

11:12.620 --> 11:14.580
Here he is.
Felix Michel.

11:14.580 --> 11:17.920
His cab's license matches
the one Laurel got into.

11:17.920 --> 11:19.460
That his address?

11:19.460 --> 11:22.460
First, tell me why I can't tell
my husband about this --

11:22.460 --> 11:24.120
and be honest.

11:27.500 --> 11:28.830
I'm embarrassed.

11:28.830 --> 11:30.170
About what?

11:30.170 --> 11:31.500
All this time,

11:31.500 --> 11:33.330
I gave Laurel
the benefit of the doubt,

11:33.330 --> 11:37.710
and I just can't take everyone
telling me, "I told you so."

11:37.710 --> 11:39.540
You mean Bonnie?

11:39.540 --> 11:41.380
She never liked Laurel,

11:41.380 --> 11:43.880
especially that
you liked Laurel.

11:43.880 --> 11:47.290
That's enough chitchat.
Why did you choose Laurel,
anyway?

11:47.290 --> 11:49.380
I mean, I get it.
I --

11:49.380 --> 11:51.330
I chose Connor.
I don't get to throw stones.

11:51.330 --> 11:54.580
But you've known
Bonnie forever,

11:54.580 --> 11:56.000
to the point
that I sometimes wondered

11:56.000 --> 11:57.580
if you were
secretly together.

11:59.710 --> 12:01.250
I said enough.
Am I right?

12:02.790 --> 12:04.620
Just give me
the frigging address.

12:11.960 --> 12:13.710
We all know the DA's using
the felony murder charge

12:13.710 --> 12:14.920
against Brandi as payback.

12:14.920 --> 12:16.120
Payback for you
screwing up?

12:16.120 --> 12:17.790
For me humiliating them.

12:17.790 --> 12:20.380
So let's humiliate them
once again by accusing them

12:20.380 --> 12:21.880
of prosecutorial
vindictiveness.

12:21.880 --> 12:22.960
Under the doctrine
of stare decisis,

12:22.960 --> 12:24.330
find me precedents that --

12:24.330 --> 12:26.250
Why don't we just put Brandi
on the stand?
No.

12:26.250 --> 12:27.540
The police shot
her unarmed black husband.

12:27.540 --> 12:28.500
We can invite the press.

12:28.500 --> 12:29.580
Brandi can't handle that.

12:29.580 --> 12:31.170
We need the public
to be outraged.

12:31.170 --> 12:32.670
And we need you
to shut up

12:32.670 --> 12:34.120
and do
what Professor Pratt says.

12:34.120 --> 12:35.750
That goes
for everyone here, okay?

12:35.750 --> 12:38.290
We're gonna felony-murder this
felony murder charge together.

12:38.290 --> 12:40.290
I thought your case
was a plea hearing.

12:40.290 --> 12:42.420
Since when are you arguing
a felony murder?

12:42.420 --> 12:44.000
We're not.
I'm getting the charges dropped.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.540
With Annalise's help,
I assume?

12:47.880 --> 12:49.170
Where is she?

12:49.170 --> 12:50.500
It's fine.
I'm gonna fix it.

12:50.500 --> 12:52.580
It's Annalise's job to fix it.
And where's Connor?

12:52.580 --> 12:54.040
He should be back
with Marisol's paperwork by now.

12:54.040 --> 12:55.960
Uh, I bet he's stuck
in traffic.

12:55.960 --> 12:59.380
Find him. And Annalise.
Right now.

12:59.380 --> 13:00.790
Sir, yes, sir.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.330
Where are you?
Connor: Maryland.

13:05.330 --> 13:07.120
I brought Hector
to see his mom.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.790
You kidnapped him?
No.

13:08.790 --> 13:11.330
You took him across state lines.
That's kidnapping.

13:11.330 --> 13:13.250
His social worker
said she'd cover for me.

13:15.210 --> 13:17.120
Hey, I-I-I-I gotta go.
Marisol's here.

13:19.120 --> 13:21.210
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.
Just tell Tegan
I'm stuck in traffic.

13:21.210 --> 13:22.540
Just record
the reunion for me.

13:22.540 --> 13:24.670
I feel like a good cry.

13:56.540 --> 13:58.830
I'm not
on the clock yet.

13:58.830 --> 14:00.670
You recognize this girl?

14:00.670 --> 14:02.000
I think you gave her a ride
this past Friday.

14:03.500 --> 14:04.500
You a detective?

14:04.500 --> 14:05.580
No, not with my record.

14:05.580 --> 14:06.830
This is your cab,
right?

14:06.830 --> 14:09.080
Yeah, but I drive
over 100 people a day.

14:10.880 --> 14:12.330
This jog your memory?

14:14.830 --> 14:16.170
The old me
woulda told you

14:16.170 --> 14:18.210
whatever you wanted
to get that money.

14:18.210 --> 14:20.210
But I'm a nice guy
these days.

14:20.210 --> 14:22.000
Sorry.

14:26.790 --> 14:28.330
Unfortunately,
we have no updates

14:28.330 --> 14:31.290
on your father's case,
Mr. Lahey.

14:31.290 --> 14:32.880
Or none you can
share with me.

14:32.880 --> 14:34.000
That, too.

14:35.500 --> 14:37.000
At least you can tell me

14:37.000 --> 14:38.170
if you're still
circling the governor.

14:39.170 --> 14:40.830
Xavier Castillo?

14:40.830 --> 14:42.330
The investigation
is ongoing.

14:42.330 --> 14:43.580
That's all
we can tell you.

14:45.460 --> 14:47.120
What if I tell you
something?

14:48.830 --> 14:52.380
Tegan Price worked
for Jorge Castillo for a decade.

14:52.380 --> 14:54.000
Then her boss,
Emmett Crawford, goes dead

14:54.000 --> 14:55.750
the moment
after the governor accused him

14:55.750 --> 14:57.000
of murdering my pops.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.170
As you know,
there's no discussing

14:58.170 --> 15:00.120
an open investigation.

15:00.120 --> 15:03.120
I don't want
to discuss anything.

15:03.120 --> 15:05.210
I just want you to arrest
the right people, like her.

15:06.790 --> 15:08.210
Tegan:
How was your day off?

15:08.210 --> 15:09.580
You make time
for a mani-pedi?

15:09.580 --> 15:11.620
I was dealing with Vivian.
Yeah?

15:11.620 --> 15:13.670
And neglecting your client,
a poor widow

15:13.670 --> 15:15.460
who Michaela got charged
with murder.

15:15.460 --> 15:17.540
So vindictive prosecution
is my fault now?

15:17.540 --> 15:19.500
Let's talk
Hector and Marisol, then.

15:19.500 --> 15:21.380
Connor promised them asylum
like he's damn Santa Claus.

15:21.380 --> 15:23.080
I'll take over that case.

15:23.080 --> 15:25.500
No, you just take
sad-sack Bonnie off my hands.

15:25.500 --> 15:27.790
I got enough of your puppies
peeing on my floor already.

15:27.790 --> 15:29.420
What?
She asked me for a job.

15:30.500 --> 15:32.460
Don't pretend
like you didn't know.

15:32.460 --> 15:34.500
You know what?

15:34.500 --> 15:37.420
If you want to punch someone,
just go to the gym.

15:37.420 --> 15:38.580
I got work to do.

15:38.580 --> 15:40.420
Uh, you leave when I say so,
Annalise!

15:43.580 --> 15:47.960
A lesbian, woman of color
running a major law firm.

15:47.960 --> 15:49.790
I'm a damn unicorn.

15:49.790 --> 15:51.420
So, to have you,

15:51.420 --> 15:53.710
not one of the 321 other men
working here,

15:53.710 --> 15:55.420
making my job harder --

15:55.420 --> 15:58.120
someone I thought
was my friend --

15:58.120 --> 16:00.500
that's not salt
in the wound.

16:00.500 --> 16:02.540
It's a chain saw
to my neck.

16:04.710 --> 16:07.330
I feel safe with you.

16:07.330 --> 16:08.710
Too safe, clearly,

16:08.710 --> 16:11.420
'cause I could see
how this is coming off.

16:11.420 --> 16:12.790
Like you're taking
advantage of me?

16:15.330 --> 16:18.120
From now on,
I'll kick ass for this firm

16:18.120 --> 16:20.000
and let you take
all the credit.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.920
I deserve
all the credit.

16:21.920 --> 16:24.000
Anything you say, boss.

16:32.210 --> 16:33.120
Great news.

16:33.120 --> 16:34.620
We found
three precedents

16:34.620 --> 16:35.710
on prosecutorial
vindictiveness,

16:35.710 --> 16:37.120
including
a 9th circuit ruling.

16:37.120 --> 16:38.880
You have tangible proof
the DA broke the law?

16:38.880 --> 16:40.170
We're working on that.
So you have nothing?

16:40.170 --> 16:41.500
I have something.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.250
I just talked to Brandi.
She wants to take the stand.

16:43.250 --> 16:45.460
I told you no.
And "no" means no, bro.

16:45.460 --> 16:47.210
The judge needs
to see Brandi's grief.

16:47.210 --> 16:48.580
The judge doesn't care
about her grief.

16:48.580 --> 16:49.580
Or maybe you're just too scared
of your own.

16:49.580 --> 16:51.000
What?

16:51.000 --> 16:52.580
You just found out
your father's dead,

16:52.580 --> 16:53.670
and now you're acting
like you don't care.

16:53.670 --> 16:55.790
He shot my mother.
Maybe I'm relieved he's dead.

16:55.790 --> 16:57.710
You know that's not true.
Would you please stop
mansplaining her own emotions?

16:57.710 --> 16:59.620
All of you, stop.

16:59.620 --> 17:01.920
I agree with Mr. Maddox.
Brandi should take the stand.

17:01.920 --> 17:03.250
No, I'm her lawyer!
This isn't even his case.

17:03.250 --> 17:04.710
But you have
to do the direct.

17:04.710 --> 17:06.670
Michaela:

17:06.670 --> 17:09.380
If you fail and we lose
this case, you go home.

17:09.380 --> 17:10.500
Deal?

17:12.040 --> 17:13.290
Deal.

17:19.710 --> 17:22.830
Sign here and here.

17:22.830 --> 17:25.120
I'll mail the application to
Immigration Services tomorrow,

17:25.120 --> 17:26.330
and then I'll get
an interview date

17:26.330 --> 17:27.880
with the Asylum Officer.

17:27.880 --> 17:31.380
Hector had to go to court.
Me, too?

17:31.380 --> 17:32.580
You've never been
detained,

17:32.580 --> 17:35.620
so the officer
can grant asylum outright.

17:35.620 --> 17:38.170
For Hector, too.

17:38.170 --> 17:40.500
You have a lot of hope.

17:40.500 --> 17:42.460
I do.

17:42.460 --> 17:43.750
Woman: Marisol Diaz?

17:48.670 --> 17:49.830
It's okay.

17:52.880 --> 17:53.830
Hi. Can I help you?

17:53.830 --> 17:55.460
Believe so.

17:55.460 --> 17:56.580
Are you Connor Walsh?

17:58.960 --> 18:00.080
Knee repeaters three times.

18:00.080 --> 18:01.790
One.

18:01.790 --> 18:03.080
Two.

18:03.080 --> 18:05.540
Three.

18:07.250 --> 18:09.330
When are you getting home?
I want pizza?

18:09.330 --> 18:10.580
I messed up.

18:10.580 --> 18:12.080
What's wrong?

18:12.080 --> 18:14.670
The social worker
ratted me out to her boss.

18:14.670 --> 18:16.420
Border Control found out,
and they --

18:16.420 --> 18:18.500
they took Hector
and Marisol into custody.

18:18.500 --> 18:20.580
Where?
This detention center
in Maryland.

18:22.420 --> 18:23.580
Oli?

18:23.580 --> 18:26.420
Yeah.

18:26.420 --> 18:28.120
Tell me
it's gonna be okay.

18:36.460 --> 18:38.380
Hey.

18:38.380 --> 18:39.500
Bonnie:
Where you been all day?

18:39.500 --> 18:42.290
You gonna ask me that
every time I walk in now?

18:42.290 --> 18:44.170
I was asking in case
you hadn't eaten.

18:48.080 --> 18:49.380
You know
I can always eat.

18:52.080 --> 18:53.330
Sit.

19:07.580 --> 19:09.170
What?

19:11.540 --> 19:14.830
Sam really screwed things up
for us, huh?

19:14.830 --> 19:17.330
Which part?

19:17.330 --> 19:19.120
Us.

19:19.120 --> 19:21.120
You and me.

19:23.620 --> 19:24.620
Don't.

19:24.620 --> 19:27.000
What did I do?

19:27.000 --> 19:29.210
You miss her.

19:29.210 --> 19:30.710
It's fine.

19:30.710 --> 19:32.040
Just don't pretend

19:32.040 --> 19:34.620
that whatever you're feeling
right now is about me.

19:36.380 --> 19:38.620
You can clean up.

19:47.330 --> 19:49.170
Connor needs your help.

19:49.170 --> 19:50.460
What happened?

19:50.460 --> 19:53.000
He got his clients
detained by ICE.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.290
Did you call Annalise?

19:54.290 --> 19:55.830
He said
she would kill him,

19:55.830 --> 19:57.580
and I agree,
she probably should.

19:57.580 --> 20:00.210
Or Tegan. Somebody should
definitely kill him.

20:00.210 --> 20:01.210
Why Tegan?

20:01.210 --> 20:03.290
They're her clients,
too.

20:11.170 --> 20:13.500
Ms. Greene, when did you know
you first loved Troy?

20:13.500 --> 20:14.960
Second time
I ever saw him.

20:14.960 --> 20:16.750
Not the first?

20:16.750 --> 20:19.460
First time was after this guy
stole my jacket at a bar.

20:19.460 --> 20:20.960
Troy said
he would get it back,

20:20.960 --> 20:22.540
and I was like,
"Yeah, whatever."

20:22.540 --> 20:23.790
And the second time?

20:23.790 --> 20:26.000
He came back
like an hour later,

20:26.000 --> 20:29.380
all beat up,
with the jacket.

20:29.380 --> 20:31.420
You know, plenty of folks
took stuff from me.

20:31.420 --> 20:34.880
He was the first
to bring something back.

20:34.880 --> 20:36.750
He always brought
something back.

20:36.750 --> 20:41.040
Brandi, whose idea was it
to rob the Check-n-Hurry?

20:41.040 --> 20:42.790
Yours?

20:42.790 --> 20:44.750
It was Troy.

20:44.750 --> 20:46.920
So, everything
that happened after --

20:46.920 --> 20:50.960
the robbery, car chase,
the shooting,

20:50.960 --> 20:53.120
Troy dying --

20:53.120 --> 20:55.330
would you say
that any of that stemmed

20:55.330 --> 20:57.210
from a decision
that you made?

20:59.710 --> 21:02.670
My husband bled out
in my lap.

21:02.670 --> 21:05.460
I held his head.

21:05.460 --> 21:08.170
And there was a hole.

21:08.170 --> 21:11.290
And I felt
when he stopped breathing.

21:11.290 --> 21:13.420
Ain't no way
I decided that.

21:16.710 --> 21:18.620
That's all, Your Honor.

21:28.080 --> 21:31.040
Did you see that?!

21:31.040 --> 21:32.620
That's why I want
to stay here --

21:32.620 --> 21:34.290
so Annalise
can teach me that.

21:34.290 --> 21:35.830
Baby,
that was all you.

21:35.830 --> 21:38.380
How would you know?

21:38.380 --> 21:40.420
I know my son.
I know what he's capable of.

21:40.420 --> 21:41.880
No, how?

21:41.880 --> 21:44.170
This is the first time

21:44.170 --> 21:46.750
that you've showed up for me
and hadn't been nodding off.

21:49.120 --> 21:50.670
You're right.

21:52.250 --> 21:55.210
But I know
what I just saw.

21:55.210 --> 21:58.040
And watching you, baby,

21:58.040 --> 22:02.620
seeing you help that woman
open up, find her voice,

22:02.620 --> 22:04.580
baby, it was like --

22:04.580 --> 22:06.540
What, Ma?

22:06.540 --> 22:08.670
It was like watching
your father.

22:11.670 --> 22:13.710
You're great.

22:13.710 --> 22:16.170
God knows that
more than me.

22:16.170 --> 22:18.460
But you can
be great anywhere.

22:21.170 --> 22:23.290
Come home with me.

22:23.290 --> 22:26.080
I, um -- I think recess
is gonna be over soon.

22:28.540 --> 22:30.960
ADA Gibson:
Ms. Greene, did Troy cook,
or was that just you?

22:30.960 --> 22:32.830
Neither of us really did.

22:32.830 --> 22:35.250
But you still thought opening
a food truck was a good idea?

22:35.250 --> 22:36.830
We figured
we'd learn by doing.

22:36.830 --> 22:40.170
"We"? Because you wanted this
food truck just as much as Troy?

22:40.170 --> 22:41.580
I know what you're doing.
I'm trying to get
to the truth.

22:41.580 --> 22:42.620
Objection.
Zero foundation.

22:42.620 --> 22:44.670
No, you want me to say
it was my idea

22:44.670 --> 22:47.120
for the food truck,
so it's my fault Troy got shot.

22:47.120 --> 22:47.830
Do you believe
it's your fault?

22:47.830 --> 22:49.250
No, it's the cop's fault.

22:49.250 --> 22:50.670
So you don't feel bad
that Troy is dead?

22:50.670 --> 22:52.080
Of course I feel bad.

22:52.080 --> 22:54.380
Because it was you who suggested
to buy the truck, wasn't it?

22:54.380 --> 22:55.420
Sanction the ADA.
Badgering the witness!

22:55.420 --> 22:57.330
And you who made Troy
steal that money?

22:57.330 --> 22:58.710
Counsel is testifying!
Enough, Ms. Gibson.

22:58.710 --> 23:00.420
We were just doing what we
needed to do to survive.

23:00.420 --> 23:02.580
So you have no guilt
about stealing $5,000?

23:02.580 --> 23:04.170
Bitch, keep talking!
Or getting your husband shot?

23:04.170 --> 23:06.080
I'll cut your head off,
you stuck-up-ass skank!

23:06.080 --> 23:07.670
Judge Nanjani:
You are in contempt of court.

23:07.670 --> 23:11.250
Remove the witness.
We are in recess.

23:12.750 --> 23:14.880
I can fix this.
I just need to redirect Brandi.

23:14.880 --> 23:16.170
You've done enough.
True story.

23:16.170 --> 23:17.880
I gave the OK.
Blame me.

23:17.880 --> 23:18.880
Tegan: I'll blame you.

23:18.880 --> 23:20.460
Annalise: What's wrong?

23:20.460 --> 23:22.210
Connor got our clients
picked up by ICE.

23:22.210 --> 23:23.380
He did what?
Oh, no.

23:23.380 --> 23:24.670
Hector's social worker
just called,

23:24.670 --> 23:27.120
said Connor took him
over state lines.

23:27.120 --> 23:28.580
Now they're detained
in Thiede County,

23:28.580 --> 23:30.420
wherever the hell that is.
I'll go with you.

23:30.420 --> 23:31.920
Don't you have a murder charge
to get thrown out?

23:31.920 --> 23:33.000
Also a true story.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.710
Clean up your mess.

23:35.710 --> 23:37.500
I got Connor's.

23:52.170 --> 23:54.000
Hey.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.420
What are you doing here?

23:55.420 --> 23:58.080
Saving your ass.
Why didn't you call me?

23:58.080 --> 24:01.250
I called someone else.
She has a plan.

24:01.250 --> 24:02.620
Bonnie: It's a confidential
case.

24:02.620 --> 24:04.880
I can only share the details
with the Director in Charge.

24:04.880 --> 24:06.460
So take me to him,
or you'll have

24:06.460 --> 24:08.210
the Philadelphia DA
calling you directly.

24:08.210 --> 24:10.460
Okay, I'll check.
You're ADA...?

24:10.460 --> 24:11.540
Winterbottom.

24:14.120 --> 24:15.420
What the hell
are you doing?

24:15.420 --> 24:16.960
Helping your clients.

24:16.960 --> 24:18.960
By hiding that you just got
fired from the DA's office?

24:18.960 --> 24:20.420
Wait, you were fired?
Yes.

24:20.420 --> 24:21.920
Quiet.
This crazy?

24:21.920 --> 24:23.250
It's in all you
Annalise people.

24:23.250 --> 24:25.290
Lying, kidnapping,
God knows what else.

24:25.290 --> 24:27.210
Look, this is my fault,
not Bonnie's.

24:28.790 --> 24:31.620
Woman: Director Mayfield
will see you now.

24:31.620 --> 24:33.210
The crazy works.

24:35.170 --> 24:37.120
You're all
from the Philly DA's?

24:37.120 --> 24:38.670
Just me.

24:38.670 --> 24:40.500
Ms. Price
and her law clerk

24:40.500 --> 24:43.290
are helping Marisol and Hector
with their asylum application.

24:43.290 --> 24:45.790
I know Marisol
because she's agreed to testify

24:45.790 --> 24:48.830
in a human-trafficking case
I'm about to take to trial.

24:48.830 --> 24:51.250
I need her released
right away.

24:51.250 --> 24:53.000
Well, the kid has a file,

24:53.000 --> 24:55.380
but the mother was picked up
without papers.

24:55.380 --> 24:57.920
We were actually
about to submit

24:57.920 --> 24:59.960
her asylum application
today.

25:06.880 --> 25:08.540
I'll release them.

25:08.540 --> 25:10.830
I just need your ID,
Ms. Winterbottom.

25:17.750 --> 25:19.500
I mean your DA badge.

25:22.420 --> 25:24.960
Bonnie:

25:24.960 --> 25:27.960
Yeah, I must have, uh,
left it at the office.

25:27.960 --> 25:30.830
I will e-mail you a copy
as soon as I get back.

25:30.830 --> 25:32.710
Okay.

25:32.710 --> 25:36.080
I've seen a lot of scams,
but this one takes the cake.

25:36.080 --> 25:38.540
This is a simple
misunderstanding.

25:38.540 --> 25:41.920
Director Mayfield, sir,
th-- this is my fault.

25:41.920 --> 25:43.620
I just wanted Hector
to see his mother.

25:43.620 --> 25:45.000
So arrest me
if you have to, but...

25:45.000 --> 25:48.500
Hey.
I know. I'm sorry.

25:48.500 --> 25:50.540
But I'm in an ICE facility
in Maryland,

25:50.540 --> 25:53.170
and I need you to tell...

25:53.170 --> 25:56.330
Adrian Mayfield to release
my client and her son.

25:56.330 --> 25:58.290
Thank you.

25:58.290 --> 25:59.670
Who the hell's that?

25:59.670 --> 26:01.670
Cora Duncan,
Undersecretary for Intelligence

26:01.670 --> 26:03.330
and Analysis
at Homeland Security.

26:07.040 --> 26:08.210
Madam Undersecretary?

26:08.210 --> 26:09.830
You couldn't have called
this person

26:09.830 --> 26:11.620
when we were trying to get
Hector asylum last week?

26:11.620 --> 26:13.250
Mayfield:
Yes, I understand.
No.

26:13.250 --> 26:14.710
Why?

26:14.710 --> 26:15.750
Of course, ma'am.

26:15.750 --> 26:18.250
Because she's my wife.

26:34.330 --> 26:35.170
We're good.

26:35.170 --> 26:36.210
He agreed not to contest

26:36.210 --> 26:38.420
either Hector
or Marisol's case.

26:38.420 --> 26:40.000
Great.
You'll just have
to supervise their interviews

26:40.000 --> 26:41.250
with the asylum office.

26:42.880 --> 26:45.290
You won this case,
not me.

26:45.290 --> 26:47.210
Only 'cause your crazy
got us into that office.

26:48.500 --> 26:49.830
Don't thank me yet.

26:49.830 --> 26:51.080
No benefits
for three months

26:51.080 --> 26:52.580
until I know I made
the right decision.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.460
Comprende, Hector?

26:57.460 --> 27:00.540
Uh, n-no mas ICE.

27:00.540 --> 27:05.500
Tu y tu mama, uh,
stay together ahora.

27:05.500 --> 27:06.920
Vamos pequeño.

27:06.920 --> 27:08.670
Di le gracias.

27:08.670 --> 27:10.040
Gracias.

27:10.040 --> 27:12.040
De nada.

27:14.290 --> 27:16.000
That's great.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.750
I know.

27:17.750 --> 27:19.500
Just, thank you.

27:21.790 --> 27:25.420
Ahh! Well, Tegan just got
Hector and Marisol out.

27:25.420 --> 27:26.580
Great.

27:26.580 --> 27:29.170
So now I'm the only disaster
around here.

27:30.460 --> 27:33.000
Which I'm not going
to mope about,

27:33.000 --> 27:36.080
not when I have
a plan to argue.

27:37.210 --> 27:40.120
Transfer of intent.

27:40.120 --> 27:41.750
The Pennsylvania statute
for felony murder

27:41.750 --> 27:44.500
was on the books long before
the 8th amendment was adopted.

27:44.500 --> 27:45.830
You think you're
gonna take your first case

27:45.830 --> 27:47.460
to the Supreme Court?

27:47.460 --> 27:49.540
Right.

27:49.540 --> 27:51.040
Right, right, right,
right. Right.

27:51.040 --> 27:53.080
Was this the plan all along?

27:53.080 --> 27:54.920
You watch me fail,
I feel like an idiot,

27:54.920 --> 27:56.290
then you come in
and save the day?

27:56.290 --> 27:57.790
The plan is to get you
to pay attention.

27:57.790 --> 28:00.120
I am paying attention!
I just hate what I'm seeing!

28:00.120 --> 28:02.500
What are you seeing?
Tell me.

28:02.500 --> 28:04.080
Because I can see
the answer to this case

28:04.080 --> 28:05.290
is right in front of you.

28:05.290 --> 28:06.580
Then tell me what it is,
please!

28:06.580 --> 28:08.210
I'll never be bitchy
to you again.

28:12.830 --> 28:14.040
Sam.

28:15.460 --> 28:17.250
What?

28:17.250 --> 28:18.880
That would be considered
felony murder,

28:18.880 --> 28:20.920
just like Brandi.

28:20.920 --> 28:23.330
No, no.

28:23.330 --> 28:25.540
That was manslaughter

28:25.540 --> 28:28.250
that -- that Wes
committed.

28:28.250 --> 28:30.460
Who pushed him
over the railing?

28:37.380 --> 28:39.080
Why are you doing this?

28:39.080 --> 28:40.620
Again, Michaela,
I'm teaching you.

28:40.620 --> 28:45.210
I mean, why...

28:45.210 --> 28:47.880
why keep protecting us?

28:47.880 --> 28:50.540
The FBI knows things,
and you could have had us

28:50.540 --> 28:53.000
arrested from the start,
or I don't know,

28:53.000 --> 28:54.380
sued us
for wrongful death,

28:54.380 --> 28:56.210
not that I had any money,
but Laurel did.

28:56.210 --> 28:58.500
Michaela.
You could have had
all that Antares money.

28:58.500 --> 29:00.580
Stop. Think about
what you just said.

29:07.250 --> 29:09.330
Oh, my God.

29:11.500 --> 29:14.710
The DA is scared
of a wrongful death suit.

29:14.710 --> 29:16.080
Duh.

29:18.830 --> 29:21.710
Mr. Richt, what's the protocol
for your investigation

29:21.710 --> 29:23.380
after an officer-involved
shooting?

29:23.380 --> 29:25.380
The officer goes on leave while
the shooting is investigated.

29:25.380 --> 29:27.580
And when that investigation
concludes...?

29:27.580 --> 29:28.960
Two reports are issued --

29:28.960 --> 29:31.500
one by the police department's
Use of Force Review Board,

29:31.500 --> 29:33.330
the other by
the District Attorney.

29:33.330 --> 29:35.830
Mr. Richt,
why did the police board

29:35.830 --> 29:38.120
issue their report on Troy's
death three months ago,

29:38.120 --> 29:40.170
yet we're still waiting on
the report from your office?

29:40.170 --> 29:41.580
Objection.
Confidentiality.

29:41.580 --> 29:43.790
Confidentiality doesn't protect
a criminal act,

29:43.790 --> 29:45.170
as Ms. Pratt will show.

29:45.170 --> 29:48.540
Overruled.
Answer, Mr. Richt.

29:48.540 --> 29:51.380
DA Miller's death created
a large backlog for our office.

29:51.380 --> 29:52.880
So the delay
isn't because your report

29:52.880 --> 29:54.420
reached a different
conclusion?

29:54.420 --> 29:56.580
That the killing of Troy Greene
was, say, not justified?

29:56.580 --> 29:58.580
ADA Gibson:
Objection. Speculation.

29:58.580 --> 30:00.830
Sustained.
Were you worried that Brandi
would use your report

30:00.830 --> 30:02.670
to file
a wrongful death suit?

30:02.670 --> 30:05.000
That's why you needed her to
plead guilty yesterday, right?

30:05.000 --> 30:06.960
So that she couldn't sue the
city for millions of dollars!

30:06.960 --> 30:10.330
The law says the prosecutor
has a broad discretion

30:10.330 --> 30:11.790
to determine
what charges to file.

30:11.790 --> 30:14.420
Exactly! You choose how the law
is applied, Mr. Richt.

30:14.420 --> 30:16.080
So, tell me,
do you actually believe

30:16.080 --> 30:19.670
in this felony murder charge
against my client?

30:19.670 --> 30:21.250
Say yes, and that means
we should all be defined

30:21.250 --> 30:22.750
by our worst decisions,

30:22.750 --> 30:24.750
punished for them
for the rest of our lives.

30:24.750 --> 30:28.210
Even if that means calling an
innocent person a murderer,

30:28.210 --> 30:32.290
because Brandi only made
one mistake here,

30:32.290 --> 30:35.460
and that's to want
a better life.

30:35.460 --> 30:38.330
That's why she sat in that car
while Troy took that money.

30:38.330 --> 30:39.750
But apparently,
you think that means

30:39.750 --> 30:41.500
she should go down
for murder.
I didn't say that.

30:41.500 --> 30:42.880
Because you don't believe
in these charges.

30:42.880 --> 30:44.380
That is very clear.

30:44.380 --> 30:46.460
Your Honor, we make a motion
to subpoena the latest draft

30:46.460 --> 30:48.250
of the DA's report on the
killing of Troy Greene,

30:48.250 --> 30:50.210
along with ADA Richt's
e-mails.

30:50.210 --> 30:51.880
ADA Gibson: Objection.
Work product privilege.

30:51.880 --> 30:53.000
Judge Nanjani: Overruled.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.790
Either you drop
the felony murder charge,

30:54.790 --> 30:56.880
or I will subpoena
that report myself.

31:02.290 --> 31:04.540
Michaela:
Give us a moment to discuss.

31:04.540 --> 31:07.620
They're offering you two years
in jail and probation.

31:07.620 --> 31:09.580
Two years?
That's a year less
than where we started

31:09.580 --> 31:11.500
and you could still file
a wrongful death suit.

31:11.500 --> 31:13.040
What are
the other options?

31:13.040 --> 31:15.670
Only probation,
but if you take it --
I take it.

31:15.670 --> 31:17.120
If you take it,
then you'll have to waive

31:17.120 --> 31:19.380
your right
to sue the city.

31:19.380 --> 31:21.670
So, two years jail
and maybe money,

31:21.670 --> 31:23.250
or no jail and no money?

31:23.250 --> 31:25.750
I think we can
win you millions.

31:25.750 --> 31:28.170
No. No.
Brandi.

31:28.170 --> 31:30.580
Look, people like me
don't usually get one win,

31:30.580 --> 31:32.170
let alone two.

31:32.170 --> 31:35.250
So, go. Go over there
and tell them I take probation.

31:35.250 --> 31:36.790
You heard
your client. Go.

31:39.620 --> 31:41.040
Okay. We've made
a decision.

31:42.620 --> 31:44.040
Show's over.

31:44.040 --> 31:46.420
Question
before you go.

31:46.420 --> 31:49.170
Um, what Michaela
was saying up there --

31:49.170 --> 31:51.420
she felt that,
deeply.

31:51.420 --> 31:53.380
Like she knows firsthand
what it's like

31:53.380 --> 31:54.330
to play a part
in a man's death.

31:54.330 --> 31:55.750
You shooting up again?

31:55.750 --> 31:57.460
Look me in the eye.

31:57.460 --> 31:58.580
Tell me that wasn't
about Sam.

31:58.580 --> 32:01.250
Hey, Mom.

32:01.250 --> 32:03.620
Your problem is not
with Annalise. It's with me.

32:03.620 --> 32:05.920
For once,
I agree with your son.

32:07.750 --> 32:10.210
Why the hell do you keep
defending her?

32:10.210 --> 32:11.620
Because I can
handle her myself.

32:11.620 --> 32:13.920
She's brainwashed you!
So, enough.

32:13.920 --> 32:15.210
Either you come home
with me now,

32:15.210 --> 32:17.460
or I am going straight
to the FBI.

32:17.460 --> 32:19.250
You can't do that.

32:19.250 --> 32:21.460
Come here. Come here.
Come here.

32:22.790 --> 32:25.710
Baby,
what's happened?

32:25.710 --> 32:27.920
You can tell me.

32:27.920 --> 32:30.330
It's true,
what Annalise said.

32:30.330 --> 32:31.380
Paul?

32:33.960 --> 32:35.670
Paul?

32:39.750 --> 32:41.620
It was an accident.

32:41.620 --> 32:44.000
I did not mean
for him to --

32:46.040 --> 32:48.420
I just wanted you to realize
that he was no good.

32:50.040 --> 32:51.210
That's all I wanted.

32:51.210 --> 32:52.710
I just wanted
to take care of you.

32:52.710 --> 32:55.210
That wasn't your job, baby!

32:55.210 --> 32:56.540
I know that now.
I just --

32:57.830 --> 32:59.830
I was just trying to be

32:59.830 --> 33:03.170
the man that you needed.

33:03.170 --> 33:06.500
I-I had to.

33:06.500 --> 33:08.420
I'm not trying
to make excuses. I'm not.

33:08.420 --> 33:12.790
I-I know this is still
my fault, because it is.

33:12.790 --> 33:14.620
Because I did it.

33:14.620 --> 33:17.250
I did it, Ma.

33:17.250 --> 33:18.710
It's -- And It's not
felony murder.

33:18.710 --> 33:20.580
It's m--

33:20.580 --> 33:22.170
It's murder, Ma.
Shh!

33:28.120 --> 33:30.420
Do you think
I'm a bad man?

33:30.420 --> 33:33.210
No. No.

33:33.210 --> 33:35.210
No, baby.

33:35.210 --> 33:37.080
No.

33:41.250 --> 33:42.380
No.

33:42.380 --> 33:45.210
You have a good heart.

33:47.620 --> 33:50.710
'Cause you're
a good man...

33:50.710 --> 33:52.670
and a good son.

33:56.710 --> 33:57.920
I got you now.

33:58.880 --> 33:59.920
You hear me?

34:01.120 --> 34:03.580
I got you.

34:18.670 --> 34:20.290
Tegan:
I'm still mad at you.

34:20.290 --> 34:23.620
So no yelling at me
for hiring Bonnie.

34:23.620 --> 34:27.000
Can I yell at you for not
telling me that you have a wife?

34:29.620 --> 34:30.920
Cora.

34:32.380 --> 34:34.750
We just haven't filed
the divorce papers yet.

34:34.750 --> 34:35.920
"We"?

34:38.330 --> 34:40.080
Me.

34:52.170 --> 34:54.500
You call me here
to kill me?

34:54.500 --> 34:57.040
You recognize this girl?
I drive over 100 people a day.

34:57.040 --> 34:59.330
'Cause I don't get
all the run-around.

34:59.330 --> 35:01.710
They threatened me.
Who?

35:01.710 --> 35:03.960
I don't know who they are,
but they said they'd kill me

35:03.960 --> 35:06.750
if I talked to anyone
about where I dropped her.

35:06.750 --> 35:08.580
It's some kind
of safe house.

35:08.580 --> 35:09.880

Okay, this is a creepy

You all planted a nanny cam

Yeah.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.750
Got her pregnant, too.

38:49.750 --> 38:51.830

Your dad wasn't the client,

39:44.830 --> 39:45.920
You get something
on Price?

39:45.920 --> 39:48.750
No. It's about
Ronald Miller.

39:48.750 --> 39:50.620
We have new evidence
leading us to believe

39:50.620 --> 39:52.290
that he was not involved
in your father's death.

39:54.170 --> 39:56.210
What evidence?

39:56.210 --> 39:59.210
Something that will help close

39:59.210 --> 40:02.290

help to close one of ours.

40:02.290 --> 40:04.330
What case?

40:04.330 --> 40:05.880
Annalise Keating.

We have a dead informant

40:19.120 --> 40:22.420
Again, I invoke my right

40:22.420 --> 40:25.540
You sure? Ms. Pratt's next door

40:25.540 --> 40:27.670
We've offered her a deal
to cooperate.

40:27.670 --> 40:30.040
You want proof?

40:30.040 --> 40:31.880
Sure.

40:31.880 --> 40:33.420
Let me talk to Michaela.

40:33.420 --> 40:34.960
I mean proof
of the murder.

40:47.880 --> 40:50.620
You did this.

40:50.620 --> 40:52.210
Tell us why.

41:29.670 --> 41:31.540
Get a medic now!

41:31.540 --> 41:33.670

Help!
