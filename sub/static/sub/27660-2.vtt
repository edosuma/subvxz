00:04.257 --> 00:06.052
Previously
on "Future Man"...

00:06.053 --> 00:07.722
My name is Athena.

00:07.723 --> 00:09.475
My comrades and I traveled
back in time to find you.

00:09.476 --> 00:11.563
Everything that happens
in the Biotic Wars is real.

00:11.564 --> 00:13.107
The Biotics, the wars.

00:13.108 --> 00:14.986
The Tiger I know
didn't stand down.

00:14.987 --> 00:17.449
That was before a whole
unit died because of me.

00:17.450 --> 00:19.203
I lost everyone to get here.

00:19.204 --> 00:22.167
- Gosh, darn it!
- Jeepers creepers.

00:22.168 --> 00:24.631
Those bags, so rascally.
I never trust 'em.

00:24.632 --> 00:26.760
I don't know how to thank
you for this, Ty-Anne.

00:26.761 --> 00:28.639
I haven't had
a home-cooked meal since,

00:28.640 --> 00:30.308
well, I lived at home
with my mom.

00:30.309 --> 00:32.354
Oh, you hush now, Stu-bear.

00:32.355 --> 00:35.110
Goodnight, you sweet,
sad little man.

00:35.111 --> 00:36.989
How do we separate
Biotics from humans?

00:36.990 --> 00:38.909
This place is thick
with sewer mushrooms.

00:38.910 --> 00:40.328
Couple of seconds
after eating those,

00:40.329 --> 00:41.957
you puke, shit yourself,
and pass out

00:41.958 --> 00:43.084
with no memory
of what happened.

00:43.085 --> 00:44.671
Except for Biotics.

00:44.672 --> 00:46.215
They're immune to all poison,

00:46.216 --> 00:48.846
so they'll be the only ones
left standing.

00:48.847 --> 00:51.183
How?

00:56.361 --> 01:00.537
Oh, shiiit!

01:05.881 --> 01:07.592
Breathe, God damn it.

01:07.593 --> 01:11.600
How did we...

01:14.105 --> 01:16.985
Get out of there?

01:18.197 --> 01:19.783
It's such a mind-fuck.

01:24.752 --> 01:27.172
2162.

01:27.173 --> 01:29.886
We made it.

01:29.887 --> 01:32.015
"This reflecting pool

01:32.016 --> 01:33.769
"commemorates
the innocent lives

01:33.770 --> 01:37.109
"lost in the horrific
Kronish Tower

01:37.110 --> 01:38.904
Terrorist Attack."

01:38.905 --> 01:40.574
Oh, my God.

01:40.575 --> 01:42.829
- We fucking did it.
- We did.

01:42.830 --> 01:44.206
We did it!

01:44.207 --> 01:46.252
Oh, Tiger, we did it!

01:46.253 --> 01:48.005
Yay!

01:51.096 --> 01:52.472
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

01:52.473 --> 01:54.268
Whoo!

01:54.269 --> 01:56.773
- Whoo!
- Ah!

01:56.774 --> 01:58.151
So long, Biotics.

01:58.152 --> 02:00.488
You exist on a plaque now.

02:00.489 --> 02:02.492
That's what's left
of your filthy kind.

02:02.493 --> 02:04.204
Yeah.

02:04.205 --> 02:05.499
That's right.

02:06.878 --> 02:09.215
Not a-- not a single one left.

02:10.050 --> 02:12.556
So we can probably never talk
about it again.

02:13.892 --> 02:16.730
- That little guy did it.
- Yeah.

02:16.731 --> 02:19.401
His name should be
on that plaque.

02:19.402 --> 02:21.573
Not those fucking Perfs.

02:21.574 --> 02:23.326
That's the best and easy fix.

02:31.761 --> 02:34.516
- There we go. Yeah.
- Yeah.

02:34.517 --> 02:36.143
I guess we should say
something.

02:36.144 --> 02:37.563
Yeah, I mean he died
for the cause.

02:37.564 --> 02:38.941
We should probably say
a few words.

02:38.942 --> 02:40.986
- Yeah.
- How do you

02:40.987 --> 02:44.451
eulogize a man like Josh?

02:50.297 --> 02:51.967
- Oh, you're really asking--
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:51.968 --> 02:53.720
Public speaking's
not really my--

02:53.721 --> 02:55.933
It doesn't have to be
a formal thing.

02:55.934 --> 02:57.770
- No, no, no.
- We'll just keep it casual.

02:57.771 --> 02:59.649
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:59.650 --> 03:01.277
- Okay, so...
- So...

03:01.278 --> 03:04.617
He, uh, made a lot of kills.

03:04.618 --> 03:06.287
And look at those names.

03:06.288 --> 03:09.627
I mean, I did a good portion
of them, but it...

03:09.628 --> 03:11.965
You have anything
you wanna add or?

03:11.966 --> 03:15.013
Though his worldly body
was incinerated

03:15.014 --> 03:17.852
and turned to ash,
I take comfort in knowing

03:17.853 --> 03:20.356
that it has become one
with the elements,

03:20.357 --> 03:23.279
aerating the soil

03:23.280 --> 03:26.536
and the earth
that we walk upon,

03:26.537 --> 03:29.918
blowing in the wind
and the air that we breathe.

03:34.260 --> 03:36.806
- Except for his cock.
- That's still kicking around,

03:36.807 --> 03:38.267
- huh?
- Yep.

03:38.268 --> 03:40.480
The living embodiment of
Josh hangs off me

03:40.481 --> 03:42.902
like a medal of honor.

03:42.903 --> 03:45.323
Though it was once
a cause of great shame,

03:45.324 --> 03:48.622
I will wear it with pride
for the rest of my days.

03:48.623 --> 03:51.920
Like him, it's small,
but efficient.

03:51.921 --> 03:53.965
It packs the occasional wallop.

03:56.012 --> 03:58.015
Not as big of a wallop
as my original rod.

03:58.016 --> 04:01.063
- Ah, yeah okay.
- But this one's adequate.

04:03.276 --> 04:05.196
- Just like Josh.
- Mm-hmm.

04:05.197 --> 04:07.827
And when I hold it in my hand
it will be

04:07.828 --> 04:10.624
like I'm holding
his hand across timelines.

04:10.625 --> 04:13.379
- Okay, all right.
- All right, I think we're good.

04:13.380 --> 04:15.801
- I think we covered it.
- Oh, yeah, sure.

04:15.802 --> 04:20.351
Only sounded like a eulogy
for your incinerated cock.

04:20.352 --> 04:22.480
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

04:22.481 --> 04:24.861
I'm just--ah, how about you?

04:24.862 --> 04:26.614
Nah, I'm good. I mean,
a millimeter to the right

04:26.615 --> 04:28.117
probably would have hit
my heart over here.

04:28.118 --> 04:30.330
- Oh, yeah, close call.
- Yeah.

04:31.166 --> 04:34.421
Well, let's see how we fit
into this brave, new world,

04:34.422 --> 04:36.843
huh?

04:36.844 --> 04:38.889
I like what
I'm seeing so far.

04:51.372 --> 04:53.417
A little hotter than our 2162,

04:53.418 --> 04:55.088
- but I could get used to this.
- Yeah.

04:55.089 --> 04:57.383
Reminds me of all those
schvitzes I took

04:57.384 --> 04:59.514
with some pretty powerful
Hollywood Jews.

04:59.515 --> 05:01.183
- Mm-hmm.
- That's where all the real

05:01.184 --> 05:02.853
- deals got made.
- Mm-hmm.

05:02.854 --> 05:05.776
And some lasting friendships.

05:05.777 --> 05:08.197
So me, Bob Evans,
Lou Wasserman--

05:08.198 --> 05:11.370
Okay, okay,
we're closing in on something.

05:11.371 --> 05:13.875
Oh. No.

05:13.876 --> 05:15.546
No.

05:15.547 --> 05:18.510
It's the Three Strung Corpses
of Alamore.

05:18.511 --> 05:20.556
It's the Death Fields.

05:20.557 --> 05:22.475
I thought we changed things.

05:22.476 --> 05:24.940
Oh. Oh, God.

05:29.867 --> 05:32.663
Wait, those aren't corpses.

05:32.664 --> 05:34.750
They're Frighten-Birds.

05:34.751 --> 05:37.297
If there's Frighten-Birds,
there must be...

05:37.298 --> 05:39.092
Outdoor food!

05:48.195 --> 05:50.115
It's a...

05:51.577 --> 05:53.538
It's a bean.

05:53.539 --> 05:56.502
And what a bean.

05:56.503 --> 05:59.300
Have we created
the land of giants?

06:00.595 --> 06:01.972
Oh.

06:03.643 --> 06:06.188
Oh.

06:06.189 --> 06:09.654
Oh, I'm sensing hints of lima.

06:12.786 --> 06:14.538
And pinto.

06:14.539 --> 06:16.960
Kidney.

06:16.961 --> 06:20.049
Black-eyed.
And navy.

06:20.050 --> 06:21.761
Navy.

06:21.762 --> 06:24.307
This is like all beans
rolled into one.

06:24.308 --> 06:26.813
Like some kind of a...

06:26.814 --> 06:29.359
mega-bean.

06:29.360 --> 06:32.741
From the death fields
to the bean fields.

06:32.742 --> 06:34.537
What a magical world.

06:41.217 --> 06:45.057
Wolf, Younglings.

06:45.058 --> 06:46.561
Fresh and undead!

06:48.189 --> 06:51.529
Wolf, I think they want to play
Hunter v. Hunted.

06:51.530 --> 06:54.325
Wolf.

06:54.326 --> 06:55.495
Wolf.

07:03.428 --> 07:07.101
- Strays in the All-Bean field!
- Strays in the All-Bean field!

07:07.102 --> 07:08.855
Strays in the All-Bean field!

07:08.856 --> 07:10.650
Strays in the All-Bean field!

07:18.249 --> 07:20.545
- That's no stray.
- That's Torque!

07:20.546 --> 07:22.758
He's got two GX239
hand cannon wounds.

07:22.759 --> 07:25.972
Shoulder, thigh,
and I'm hit upper abdomen.

07:29.648 --> 07:33.571
- Weasel. Is that you?
- Who are you calling weasel?

07:33.572 --> 07:36.243
- 'Cause that's your name.
- My name is Wrench.

07:36.244 --> 07:38.330
And there's no outsiders
allowed in the NAG.

07:38.331 --> 07:40.710
It's Tiger. I'm with Wolf.

07:40.711 --> 07:43.633
That's Torque. I know him.

07:43.634 --> 07:46.556
I don't know you.
Maybe you're helping him.

07:46.557 --> 07:48.810
Or maybe you're the one
that gave him those injuries.

07:48.811 --> 07:52.358
Trying to use him for cover.
Sneak in, poach our beans.

07:52.359 --> 07:54.572
- That your game?
- Is she Bio-Tech?

07:54.573 --> 07:55.824
She sure smells like one.

07:55.825 --> 07:57.160
We'll know for sure after
she takes

07:57.161 --> 07:59.122
the sewer-mushroom test.

07:59.123 --> 08:03.798
Your pants make brown,
welcome to our town.

08:03.799 --> 08:06.387
Your pants stay dry...

08:08.099 --> 08:10.520
You're gonna die.

08:10.521 --> 08:13.693
Anvil! Go get the Bio-Tester.

08:20.207 --> 08:22.711
- Hey, you're back.
- Huh? What?

08:22.712 --> 08:24.255
- You're home.
- What?

08:24.256 --> 08:26.176
Come on.

08:26.177 --> 08:28.766
- Let's get you some help.
- Huh? What?

09:33.102 --> 09:35.481
If we succeed,
we go back to the future,

09:35.482 --> 09:38.362
the Biotics don't exist,
and our team is still alive.

09:38.363 --> 09:40.491
That's different people
who don't know us

09:40.492 --> 09:42.871
- or what we did.
- But I'll know.

09:42.872 --> 09:46.587
And you'll know.
And we'll have each other.

09:46.588 --> 09:48.256
I've given you my life

09:48.257 --> 09:49.761
because I trust you.

09:50.930 --> 09:52.766
It was all worth it
to get you back.

09:52.767 --> 09:55.229
You're the only family I need.

09:55.230 --> 09:58.110
You and your mutant race
deserve to die!

10:09.676 --> 10:11.637
Come!

10:11.638 --> 10:14.561
Come! C-come!

10:16.606 --> 10:19.193
Come!

10:19.194 --> 10:23.118
C-come! Come!

10:23.119 --> 10:25.038
Out with you, boy!

10:25.039 --> 10:26.918
C-come!

10:28.337 --> 10:31.009
Come!

10:31.010 --> 10:33.180
- Come!
- Reveal yourself!

10:33.181 --> 10:35.392
Devil child!

10:35.393 --> 10:37.355
C-come!

10:38.734 --> 10:40.779
Come!

10:40.780 --> 10:42.198
Come one, come all

10:42.199 --> 10:44.076
to the great red planet MARS!

10:44.077 --> 10:45.914
Yep, it's me:
Lil Jimmy McGurgan.

10:45.915 --> 10:47.166
Earth is dying.

10:47.167 --> 10:48.544
Lucky for us,

10:48.545 --> 10:50.464
the solar system gave us
a spare planet

10:50.465 --> 10:53.679
right next door, and I'm gonna
be the first boy on MARS.

10:53.680 --> 10:55.642
- What?
- But before I get there,

10:55.643 --> 10:57.478
we've all got some training
to do.

10:57.479 --> 11:00.735
Mons hab units are open now,
no Ethereum down!

11:00.736 --> 11:03.991
Come! Come one, come all to
the great red planet MARS.

11:03.992 --> 11:06.162
Yep, it's me:
Lil Jimmy McGurgan.

11:06.163 --> 11:07.456
Earth is dying.

11:07.457 --> 11:09.043
Lucky for us, the solar system

11:09.044 --> 11:10.462
gave us a spare planet

11:10.463 --> 11:11.799
right next door...

11:36.558 --> 11:38.101
You. Moon man.

11:38.102 --> 11:40.524
What the fuck's going on here?

11:56.890 --> 11:59.185
Hello and welcome to the Mons.

11:59.186 --> 12:01.397
I'm your automated guide
Cassini.

12:01.398 --> 12:03.234
How may I be of service?

12:03.235 --> 12:05.990
I want answers, Cassini,
and I want them now.

12:05.991 --> 12:08.244
Okeydokey,
what kind of answers?

12:08.245 --> 12:09.831
Commonly asked
questions include:

12:09.832 --> 12:11.752
what does it smell like
on MARS?

12:11.753 --> 12:13.506
Is it hot or cold on MARS?

12:13.507 --> 12:15.467
Will I need a jacket on MARS?

12:15.468 --> 12:17.722
- And are there Martians on MARS?
- Okay.

12:17.723 --> 12:21.647
Were all these people in
these bubble huts Bio-Techs?

12:21.648 --> 12:24.110
Oopsie.
Hate speech is a no-no.

12:24.111 --> 12:27.867
Please restate your question
using the term "human beings."

12:27.868 --> 12:31.457
Okay, are these human beings,
were they given a super-cure

12:31.458 --> 12:33.713
- for all diseases?
- You betcha.

12:33.714 --> 12:35.550
Their ancestors
were given the cure

12:35.551 --> 12:38.346
- more than 100 years ago.
- Fuck me.

12:38.347 --> 12:40.601
I personally cannot
perform that service,

12:40.602 --> 12:43.189
but here are some local
establishments that can.

12:43.190 --> 12:45.945
The Rub Hub,
The "O" -Zone, Spunknik.

12:45.946 --> 12:47.115
Okay.

12:48.618 --> 12:50.370
Was there a war
because the government

12:50.371 --> 12:52.959
forced a super-cure
on an unwilling populace?

12:52.960 --> 12:55.005
- No.
- Oh, thank God.

12:55.006 --> 12:56.800
There was a war
because the government

12:56.801 --> 12:58.971
withheld the cure
from a large portion

12:58.972 --> 13:01.142
of a desperate
and dying populace,

13:01.143 --> 13:04.023
kicking off 100 years
of global bloodshed,

13:04.024 --> 13:06.904
the likes of which our planet
has never seen.

13:06.905 --> 13:08.323
No, I can't believe this.

13:08.324 --> 13:10.578
Retrieving visual proof.

13:10.579 --> 13:13.083
I've curated
the most disturbing images

13:13.084 --> 13:15.462
to convey
maximum emotional impact,

13:15.463 --> 13:18.928
forgoing a traditional
narrative form of storytelling.

13:18.929 --> 13:21.600
Does it help if I go faster?

13:21.601 --> 13:24.438
- Stop. Stop.
- Cassini, stop!

13:24.439 --> 13:26.944
The next thing out
of your squawk box

13:26.945 --> 13:29.991
better be some good news
about the last 100 years.

13:29.992 --> 13:31.285
How about this?

13:31.286 --> 13:33.749
Thanks to
the Armistice of 2142,

13:33.750 --> 13:36.672
humanity has enjoyed 20 years
of lasting peace.

13:36.673 --> 13:38.926
Yeah, yeah, tell me more
about these peace accords.

13:38.927 --> 13:41.264
The Peace Accord
Bombings of 2094

13:41.265 --> 13:42.892
devastated Western Europe.

13:42.893 --> 13:46.482
Does that sound
like good news to you, Cassini!

13:46.483 --> 13:48.319
Ma'am? Ma'am!

13:48.320 --> 13:49.865
You are currently breaking

13:49.866 --> 13:53.079
the Violence Against
Machines Act of 2139.

13:53.080 --> 13:55.710
Yeah, I'm gonna break
a lot more than that

13:55.711 --> 13:57.589
you fucking Dork-a-tron!

13:57.590 --> 14:00.385
I am computer code and
cannot be physically harmed.

14:00.386 --> 14:02.389
You appear to be injured.

14:02.390 --> 14:06.105
Your current rate of blood loss
is 9.6 milliliters per minute.

14:06.106 --> 14:08.861
I advise you to seek
medical attention.

14:08.862 --> 14:11.658
Oh, uh, have a wonderful day.

14:34.956 --> 14:37.292
What the fuck is this shit?

14:44.432 --> 14:47.438
Fuck!

14:51.488 --> 14:52.908
Well... no.

15:21.883 --> 15:24.763
- Uh, is Tony in?
- I was hoping to have this clean

15:24.764 --> 15:26.684
by Mon... day.

15:29.481 --> 15:30.816
You do know
there's an infirmary

15:30.817 --> 15:32.319
two quads up, three over?

15:54.489 --> 15:58.037
Two quads up, three over.
Okay.

16:29.058 --> 16:31.646
- Where'd she go?
- She's right here.

16:40.206 --> 16:42.292
Now you found me,
what do you want?

16:42.293 --> 16:44.505
To invite you.

16:44.506 --> 16:46.175
Up there.

17:09.640 --> 17:11.268
Oh, come on.

17:15.777 --> 17:17.112
I can't believe it.

17:17.113 --> 17:18.907
You're here.

17:18.908 --> 17:21.538
Oh, you're hurt.
Doctor Hogeveen!

17:21.539 --> 17:24.459
- How are you here?
- How are you here?

17:24.460 --> 17:27.090
It's been 144 years,
7 months, and 3 days

17:27.091 --> 17:28.927
since that magical--

17:28.928 --> 17:31.223
since we met.

17:31.224 --> 17:32.602
You haven't aged a day.

17:32.603 --> 17:34.522
Yeah,
I've aged a day.

17:34.523 --> 17:37.444
- One really shitty day.
- Eunice, please, she's hurt.

17:37.445 --> 17:39.114
One day?

17:39.115 --> 17:41.035
How is that possible?

17:41.036 --> 17:44.333
- Time travel.
- But that doesn't exist.

17:44.334 --> 17:46.880
Well obviously it exists
because I'm here in your...

17:46.881 --> 17:49.384
what do you call this?
Mountain lair?

17:49.385 --> 17:51.848
You freeze yourself?
You're a cryo-slag now?

17:51.849 --> 17:53.560
- This is a miracle.
- It's...

17:53.561 --> 17:55.355
This is happiness
I don't deserve.

17:55.356 --> 17:57.067
- A bolt of joy.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:57.068 --> 17:59.697
- How did Kronish's cure get out?
- Kronish?

17:59.698 --> 18:03.412
- His work died with him.
- What--ow!

18:03.413 --> 18:05.249
- These wounds.
- It would help if I could see

18:05.250 --> 18:07.253
- the weapon that caused them.
- Yeah, we'll just pop back

18:07.254 --> 18:10.678
140 years and take them off
the chucklefucks who shot me.

18:10.679 --> 18:12.138
Who developed the cure?

18:12.139 --> 18:14.936
Ah you know,
I don't like to

18:14.937 --> 18:18.150
toot my own kazoo,
but it was me.

18:18.151 --> 18:19.529
It was my life's work.

18:19.530 --> 18:21.490
Why would you do that?

18:21.491 --> 18:23.829
Because tens of millions
of people were dying

18:23.830 --> 18:25.206
and I wanted to save them.

18:25.207 --> 18:27.670
You monster! Ah!

18:27.671 --> 18:31.679
- Fuck! What?
- Get it out of your system.

18:34.475 --> 18:36.563
Reveal yourself.

18:36.564 --> 18:38.357
- I'm not hiding.
- Come on!

18:38.358 --> 18:40.111
- Is this a joke?
- This is me.

18:40.112 --> 18:41.614
I'm a hologram.

18:41.615 --> 18:43.827
- It's true.
- He is a hologram.

18:43.828 --> 18:45.914
I appreciate you keeping
an open mind.

18:45.915 --> 18:48.335
What kind of sick fucking
techno nightmare

18:48.336 --> 18:50.381
did I just wake up in?

18:50.382 --> 18:52.428
Eunice, can you please
give us a moment?

18:54.600 --> 18:56.060
Look, I...

18:57.814 --> 19:02.656
I know this is a lot to take
in, but, um, I'm an AIS,

19:02.657 --> 19:04.284
an Augmented
Intelligence System.

19:04.285 --> 19:06.581
I uploaded my brain,
my memories.

19:06.582 --> 19:08.083
Everything about me
still exists.

19:08.084 --> 19:09.962
I just don't have a body.

19:09.963 --> 19:11.466
So you're a robo-ghost.

19:13.805 --> 19:16.308
Will you excuse me
one second?

19:16.309 --> 19:17.352
Fuck.

19:17.353 --> 19:18.814
Oh, that was a disaster.

19:18.815 --> 19:20.399
You're catastrophizing.

19:20.400 --> 19:22.445
- She hates me.
- She doesn't hate you.

19:22.446 --> 19:24.992
I waited 144 years

19:24.993 --> 19:26.579
for the only woman
I've ever loved

19:26.580 --> 19:27.957
to come walking
through the door

19:27.958 --> 19:30.879
and I immediately blow it.

19:30.880 --> 19:33.217
Why couldn't I have programmed
myself to be cool?

19:33.218 --> 19:35.179
Stu, take a deep breath.

19:39.230 --> 19:41.358
She probably blames me
for the war.

19:41.359 --> 19:42.778
But I wasn't the one
who decided

19:42.779 --> 19:43.864
who got the cure
and who didn't.

19:43.865 --> 19:45.199
It was those bastards

19:45.200 --> 19:46.578
at the World
Health Organization.

19:46.579 --> 19:48.790
And history reviles them
for it.

19:48.791 --> 19:52.088
I have dedicated my life
to healing humanity.

19:52.089 --> 19:55.219
I extended my life so that
I could continue trying.

19:55.220 --> 19:57.015
If only there was a way
I could program

19:57.016 --> 19:59.227
- that information into her.
- There is.

19:59.228 --> 20:00.689
It's called "telling her."

20:00.690 --> 20:03.820
Use your words, Stu.

20:03.821 --> 20:05.281
I'll probably
just mess it up.

20:05.282 --> 20:07.452
Try considering
how she feels.

20:07.453 --> 20:08.788
With your computing power,

20:08.789 --> 20:10.959
you've had
16 quadrillion lifetimes

20:10.960 --> 20:12.755
to process these feelings.

20:12.756 --> 20:14.675
She's had 12 minutes.

20:14.676 --> 20:16.470
Yeah.

20:16.471 --> 20:18.433
You're right.
Just...

20:19.811 --> 20:21.146
It's Ty-Anne.

20:21.147 --> 20:23.818
- It's the real Ty-Anne.
- I know.

20:23.819 --> 20:26.198
- I don't want to blow it.
- Stu.

20:26.199 --> 20:29.329
You're not just a person.
You're a good person.

20:29.330 --> 20:32.962
- No, no.
- Stuart, look at me.

20:32.963 --> 20:35.466
You're a person.

20:39.058 --> 20:40.393
Do you need a hug?

20:40.394 --> 20:42.230
Yeah.

20:42.231 --> 20:45.570
Can you be the bunny?

20:45.571 --> 20:47.448
We're inside
your operating system.

20:47.449 --> 20:49.286
I can be whatever you want.

20:53.336 --> 20:55.966
- There you go.
- There you go.

20:55.967 --> 20:58.012
Settle into that fur.

20:58.013 --> 20:59.640
Where were we?

20:59.641 --> 21:02.604
You were blabbing about
being a computer zombie.

21:02.605 --> 21:04.817
Your feelings are
understandable

21:04.818 --> 21:06.779
and valid,
Ty-Anne.

21:06.780 --> 21:10.327
- Ty-Anne? Ah, right, yeah.
- I was at your house yesterday.

21:10.328 --> 21:13.793
Well, no, I'm Tiger,
and I'm from the year 2162.

21:13.794 --> 21:15.839
But not this bullshit version.

21:15.840 --> 21:17.258
The version
where I was sent back

21:17.259 --> 21:19.220
to stop the cure
from ever getting out.

21:19.221 --> 21:21.183
You were just a mark
for my mission

21:21.184 --> 21:23.980
to blow up the Kronitorium and
destroy all Kronish's research.

21:23.981 --> 21:26.652
- What are you talking about?
- You didn't blow up the lab.

21:26.653 --> 21:28.447
That was the Krona-bomber.

21:28.448 --> 21:29.743
Joosh Futturman.

21:31.120 --> 21:32.873
Little Boy Blew.

21:32.874 --> 21:35.587
- Yeah, he was with us.
- You were working with him?

21:35.588 --> 21:37.549
He was a cold-blooded killer.

21:37.550 --> 21:39.804
He was remorseless
during the trial.

21:39.805 --> 21:42.058
This--this does not compute.

21:42.059 --> 21:43.978
Yeah, you know
what else doesn't compute?

21:43.979 --> 21:46.358
The world I come from, we were
in the midst of a 30-year war.

21:46.359 --> 21:49.030
Now, thanks to you,
we're up to 100.

21:49.031 --> 21:52.704
- It's 114, actually.
- We round down for morale.

21:52.705 --> 21:56.419
Do you understand now why you
being the father of the cure

21:56.420 --> 21:58.925
is not exactly the bee's knees.

21:58.926 --> 22:00.887
- Oh, boy.
- This next part...

22:00.888 --> 22:04.854
Look, I want you
to trust me, and, uh,

22:04.855 --> 22:07.275
the foundation to any healthy
relationship is honesty.

22:07.276 --> 22:09.195
So--
Out with it, phantom!

22:09.196 --> 22:11.032
When you stab me,
it doesn't hurt me physically,

22:11.033 --> 22:12.911
- but it does hurt my heart.
- Oh, that just makes me wanna

22:12.912 --> 22:15.374
- to stab you more.
- Okay, if...

22:15.375 --> 22:17.295
If I'm the father of the cure,

22:17.296 --> 22:20.343
then you're kinda the mom.

22:21.889 --> 22:23.808
What!

22:23.809 --> 22:25.979
When you saved my life

22:25.980 --> 22:28.192
by leaving me that note,
I wanted to thank you,

22:28.193 --> 22:29.612
but you vanished.

22:29.613 --> 22:30.906
I had no way to
get in contact with you.

22:30.907 --> 22:33.160
- Watch out!
- Fuck.

22:33.161 --> 22:34.955
Then I remembered
that I'm a scientist,

22:34.956 --> 22:37.376
so I could find you using
something that you left behind.

22:37.377 --> 22:38.672
Like what?

22:40.843 --> 22:42.512
The genomic structure
of your DNA

22:42.513 --> 22:44.349
was like nothing I'd ever seen.

22:46.563 --> 22:48.023
No, that's a hologram too.

22:48.024 --> 22:49.526
The original was purchased
by Elon Musk

22:49.527 --> 22:52.783
in a competitive
bidding situation.

22:52.784 --> 22:56.373
You used my Biotic DNA
to create the cure?

22:56.374 --> 22:58.210
I thought you were
an angel from heaven.

22:58.211 --> 22:59.797
I thought that this was
my life's purpose,

22:59.798 --> 23:02.009
to use this to heal the world.

23:02.010 --> 23:04.430
To save humanity,
the way you saved me.

23:06.520 --> 23:09.482
No, no, no, that's--

23:09.483 --> 23:11.444
Hologram. I'm so sorry.

23:11.445 --> 23:13.784
That was the worst time
for that to happen.

23:35.703 --> 23:37.496
- No, I get it.
- Oh, son of a--

23:37.497 --> 23:39.710
- I get it.
- You hate me.

23:39.711 --> 23:41.171
No, I don't.

23:41.172 --> 23:43.676
This isn't your fault, okay?
It's mine.

23:43.677 --> 23:45.972
I'm the one who left
behind body-relics,

23:45.973 --> 23:49.270
and that mistake... made it
so I destroyed humanity.

23:49.271 --> 23:51.358
No, you saved it.

23:51.359 --> 23:54.072
None of these people would be
alive if it wasn't for you.

23:54.073 --> 23:56.744
If you hadn't left
behind those body-relics,

23:56.745 --> 23:59.541
humanity would have gone
the way of the bees.

23:59.542 --> 24:02.881
And the bats.
All animals, really.

24:02.882 --> 24:04.843
Oh, great. Well I saved
the doofus brigade.

24:04.844 --> 24:07.264
Just in time for the planet
to die. Super proud.

24:07.265 --> 24:09.185
But we are not gonna die
with it.

24:09.186 --> 24:10.688
Look, all these people are not

24:10.689 --> 24:12.316
worrying about the end
of the world.

24:12.317 --> 24:14.237
They're looking forward
to starting a new one.

24:14.238 --> 24:17.284
Hey, Jimmy! You excited
about the MARS launch?

24:17.285 --> 24:18.913
- You bet, Stu.
- Check out my new suit.

24:18.914 --> 24:20.917
First boy on MARS!

24:20.918 --> 24:22.629
No one can take
that away from you.

24:24.258 --> 24:26.094
Really wish I could take
that away from him,

24:26.095 --> 24:28.892
but the rules of the radio
call-in contest were clear.

24:36.992 --> 24:38.579
This changes everything.

24:39.747 --> 24:42.544
For the first time,
humanity is working together

24:42.545 --> 24:44.756
- in pursuit of a single goal.
- Does that include

24:44.757 --> 24:46.969
the spear-wielding man-mountain
over at the NAG?

24:46.970 --> 24:49.307
'Cause his goal seemed to be
to make me shit myself.

24:49.308 --> 24:52.021
The good people of the NAG
are invited to MARS.

24:52.022 --> 24:53.941
I've reached out to them
countless times.

24:53.942 --> 24:57.574
But they're so anti-tech.
They don't trust me.

24:57.575 --> 24:59.912
When I finally made enough
cure, I sent it to them.

24:59.913 --> 25:01.874
They smashed it with rocks.

25:01.875 --> 25:05.130
When puppies went extinct,
I sent them PUP-E,

25:05.131 --> 25:08.178
an adorable robo-dog.
They smashed them with rocks.

25:08.179 --> 25:09.681
I can't blame them
on that one.

25:09.682 --> 25:11.434
I mean, you replaced
a stable food source

25:11.435 --> 25:13.480
with an inedible toy, so.

25:13.481 --> 25:16.152
I am trying really,
really hard.

25:16.153 --> 25:17.948
I know I can't force anyone

25:17.949 --> 25:21.079
to see the great thing
we're doing here,

25:21.080 --> 25:22.707
but I hope you will.

25:22.708 --> 25:24.670
Okay, Stu.

25:24.671 --> 25:26.590
Yeah, maybe
this world is better

25:26.591 --> 25:29.178
than the world
I came from, but...

25:29.179 --> 25:31.725
that doesn't mean
I have a place in it.

25:31.726 --> 25:33.896
I still don't know who I am.

25:33.897 --> 25:37.361
Or how I got this way.

25:37.362 --> 25:41.369
And now I have nobody.
I'm alone.

25:41.370 --> 25:42.872
Well, that's where
you're wrong.

26:01.578 --> 26:05.794
Tiger, meet Ty-Anne.
My daughter.

26:07.255 --> 26:08.925
Hi.
