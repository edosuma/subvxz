00:05.964 --> 00:07.591
<i>Previously on </i>Z Nation.

00:07.674 --> 00:08.759
<i>Where are we?</i>

00:09.343 --> 00:12.638
<i>Welcome to Zona.
I can't wait for you to meet The Founder.</i>

00:12.721 --> 00:14.264
We've met before.

00:14.348 --> 00:16.683
<i>Without him, all this wouldn't be here.</i>

00:16.767 --> 00:22.773
As I speak, the last of the unvaxed
homo sapiens are self-destructing.

00:24.566 --> 00:26.735
<i>We must hurry history along.</i>

00:27.778 --> 00:30.155
<i>It is time for The Reset.</i>

01:22.207 --> 01:24.293
[thump]

01:52.571 --> 01:54.323
[snarling and crunching]

02:10.088 --> 02:12.883
-Leave? Are you insane?
-You don't have a choice.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.051
Like hell I don't.

02:14.676 --> 02:17.179
I don't know if you've noticed,
I'm kind of a big deal around here.

02:17.262 --> 02:19.264
I can see that, but it's my duty
to get you out of here.

02:19.348 --> 02:22.184
How could I expect you to understand?
Can you back me up here, please?

02:22.267 --> 02:26.813
- Teller, what is this about?
- No time to explain. Things are changing.

02:26.897 --> 02:29.191
-This is a terrible idea.
-You're no longer safe here.

02:29.274 --> 02:32.778
- Looks safe to me.
- Compared to what? A raging apocalypse?

02:32.861 --> 02:37.866
The situation has progressed to a point
where... measures need to be taken.

02:37.949 --> 02:39.451
I don't know what the hell
he's talking about.

02:39.534 --> 02:42.245
- Murph!
- Hey! Surf and Turf Tuesday!

02:42.329 --> 02:43.455
Am I right? I'll call you!

02:44.915 --> 02:46.958
-I'll explain later.
-No, please explain now.

02:47.042 --> 02:49.711
-I'm missing appointments as we speak.
-They're no longer important.

02:49.795 --> 02:53.799
That's very easy for you to say!
You don't get invited to the things I do.

02:53.882 --> 02:55.759
-[man] Oh!
-Hey!

02:55.842 --> 02:59.596
-Where are the whites, M-dog?
-I still need to change. Hey!

02:59.679 --> 03:01.056
Terribly sorry, Mr. Winslow,

03:01.139 --> 03:03.725
but Mr. Murphy and I have
a very important engagement.

03:03.809 --> 03:05.811
-Well, surely it can wait.
-He's up third.

03:05.894 --> 03:08.522
-I'm up third!
-We can't hold up the entire event.

03:08.605 --> 03:09.689
-Right?
-Terribly sorry.

03:09.773 --> 03:12.776
-You should be. I'm reporting you.
-Let's go.

03:12.859 --> 03:14.611
-Man!
-Should we hold your spot?

03:14.694 --> 03:17.114
Absolutely! I'm getting my whites!

03:24.830 --> 03:26.998
-Come on.
-How long do we have?

03:27.082 --> 03:30.127
I'm afraid we're already too late.
It's gonna be leaving any minute.

03:30.210 --> 03:32.921
-What's gonna be leaving?
-You just have to trust me.

03:33.004 --> 03:35.882
-This will all make sense eventually.
-Well, that's very encouraging.

03:35.966 --> 03:38.260
Do you have any idea
how many people I'm disappointing,

03:38.343 --> 03:40.137
by missing this lawn bowling tournament?

03:40.220 --> 03:42.389
It's the back half
of the season, you know.

03:42.472 --> 03:44.641
I liked you better when you were blue.

03:44.725 --> 03:47.811
I don't understand why everything
always has to go straight to shit.

03:47.894 --> 03:49.229
It's called entropy.

04:07.456 --> 04:08.749
Arrived to the safe house.

04:08.832 --> 04:10.751
[man]
<i>Copy. Stand by for new coordinates.</i>

04:10.834 --> 04:13.670
-Let go of me!
-Keep them quiet.

04:19.676 --> 04:20.761
Move it.

04:26.057 --> 04:27.350
Get her in there. Now!

04:37.068 --> 04:38.528
Get a scope on those vehicles.

05:09.935 --> 05:13.480
We have no information regarding
its whereabouts or its position.

05:13.563 --> 05:16.274
What we do know
is that the convoy is overdue.

05:16.358 --> 05:19.361
It's possible they're lost
or have run into mechanical difficulties.

05:19.444 --> 05:22.781
This, however, does not change
our objective or our time frame.

05:24.407 --> 05:27.994
You've been telling us to
be patient, to stand by, to stay put.

05:28.078 --> 05:29.663
But what if this convoy isn't coming?

05:29.746 --> 05:32.207
Then we're staying put, wasting our
resources that we could be--

05:32.290 --> 05:34.751
-I understand your frustration.
-How can you?

05:35.669 --> 05:40.048
We've survived this long by moving,
hiding, trusting only ourselves.

05:40.340 --> 05:43.510
Now you want us to trust you,
but here, out in the open,

05:43.593 --> 05:46.805
exposed to the elements,
we're sitting zombie bait.

05:46.888 --> 05:47.973
We don't have a choice.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.976
Now we can sit and complain
about the state of things,

05:51.059 --> 05:53.562
or we can be proactive
and find a solution.

05:54.229 --> 05:55.730
And that's what I intend to do.

05:56.273 --> 05:58.316
The convoy was headed down this road.

05:58.400 --> 06:01.319
Based on our last contact,
it would have to be between here...

06:01.403 --> 06:04.114
-and here.
-That's almost ten miles.

06:04.197 --> 06:05.740
It is what it is.

06:06.449 --> 06:08.285
The convoy has
the munitions and supplies

06:08.368 --> 06:10.787
necessary to feed and protect us
on our trek North.

06:10.996 --> 06:14.040
Without it, we are at
a severe disadvantage.

06:14.124 --> 06:18.336
I am calling upon two able-bodied
volunteers to join myself,

06:18.420 --> 06:21.256
Sergeant Czarnecki,
and Private Lilley on a search party,

06:21.381 --> 06:23.925
to track down the convoy
and help lead it to camp.

06:24.009 --> 06:26.595
It's dangerous, but not acting
is more dangerous.

06:26.678 --> 06:28.346
-We'll go.
-Mm-hmm.

06:29.347 --> 06:32.392
-It's okay. We'll be back. I promise.
-I'll see to it.

06:35.395 --> 06:38.398
-Well, I ain't got nothing else to do.
-Good. Leave in 10.

06:38.481 --> 06:41.651
The rest of you need to rotate
standing guard until we return.

06:41.735 --> 06:44.154
Sergeant Czarnecki will give
you ammunition if you need it.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.994
Let's just all take a moment to
consider what you're proposing,

06:51.077 --> 06:53.246
so we can all be crystal clear.

06:53.330 --> 06:57.751
We need to leave this life of martinis
and fine dining and limbo parties,

06:57.834 --> 07:03.506
for a swift return to the zombie-infested
nightmare because of a few changes?

07:03.590 --> 07:06.593
[scoffing] I mean, I for one,
feel amenable to change.

07:06.676 --> 07:09.387
It's not going to be the Zona
you've come to know much longer.

07:10.055 --> 07:11.514
Hell's does that mean?

07:15.810 --> 07:18.188
What's really going on, Teller?

07:18.271 --> 07:20.899
-Everything will make sense in time.
-[scoffs]

07:20.982 --> 07:23.401
Teller.

07:23.485 --> 07:25.612
There's a helicopter's leaving
in the next 15 minutes.

07:25.695 --> 07:28.782
And if we're not on that chopper,
we don't survive.

07:28.865 --> 07:31.660
-Is that definitive enough for you?
-No, it's not.

07:31.743 --> 07:33.703
What the hell is going on?

07:34.871 --> 07:36.998
D-- degenerative brain function.

07:37.082 --> 07:39.042
They're--
they're all rapidly deteriorating.

07:39.125 --> 07:41.586
They're losing their minds.
They're going batshit crazy.

07:41.753 --> 07:43.838
-Who is?
-Everyone. who had the new vaccine.

07:43.922 --> 07:46.383
-It's failing.
-My vaccine? No way!

07:46.466 --> 07:48.385
-Why?
-We don't know.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.845
There must've been something else
in your blood, something--

07:51.221 --> 07:53.765
Okay, wait! Just-- just wait! Okay?

07:53.848 --> 07:56.518
Because this cannot be happening!

07:56.601 --> 07:59.938
Because-- [panting]

08:00.021 --> 08:01.898
I just...

08:01.982 --> 08:03.692
I've had such...

08:03.775 --> 08:05.944
a wonderful... time... here.

08:06.027 --> 08:07.946
-Murphy...
-Let me finish.

08:08.029 --> 08:11.199
I mean, all of these great people.

08:11.282 --> 08:14.536
Every day. I mean, the friendships...

08:14.619 --> 08:18.456
The-- the-- the casual sex.

08:18.540 --> 08:21.376
I mean, I haven't had it
this good since-- since--

08:21.459 --> 08:22.711
-[loud pop]
-Shit!

08:43.648 --> 08:48.236
Ah! Mr. Spears!
I thought I recognized that fade shot.

08:48.319 --> 08:51.406
My man, Murphy.
Where have you been, ya scoundrel?

08:51.489 --> 08:54.492
Uh, well... You know.

08:54.576 --> 08:56.786
You missed the tourney!

08:56.870 --> 08:59.539
Apologies. I apologize.
[chuckles]

08:59.622 --> 09:03.877
It seems that's all I do
these days is-- oh.

09:03.960 --> 09:07.297
Yeah.
I had to partner with Beardsley.

09:07.380 --> 09:10.508
Possibly the worst croquet player
on the island.

09:10.592 --> 09:12.135
That is unfortunate.

09:12.218 --> 09:14.471
It does seem, however,
that you've moved on.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.598
Yeah. Thank God we still have golf, hmm?

09:16.681 --> 09:18.141
Yes. A gentleman's sport.

09:19.225 --> 09:23.146
This is a new 4 iron.
Very difficult club to hit well.

09:23.229 --> 09:25.982
As I've been trying to explain
to Reynolds over here.

09:26.066 --> 09:28.568
Well, some people just
aren't great listeners.

09:28.651 --> 09:30.612
Some people aren't great golfers, Murphy!

09:30.695 --> 09:33.239
Some people spend their time
thinking about backswing.

09:34.657 --> 09:36.493
Well, here's some free advice, my friend.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.912
- Hmm?
- You'll thank me later.

09:40.080 --> 09:43.666
It's all... about... the follow-through.

09:43.750 --> 09:46.586
Oh. Well. Yes, of course.
I mean, I knew that.

09:46.669 --> 09:49.130
-And keeping your elbow straight.
-Naturally.

09:49.214 --> 09:52.717
And your damn head down!
Goddamn, it's frustrating!

09:54.010 --> 09:56.012
Well, it really is a mental sport.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.764
Christ, Murphy. You missed the tourney.

09:57.847 --> 10:01.267
-We already covered that, so--
-I had to partner with Beardsley.

10:02.352 --> 10:05.105
As you can imagine, first-round exit.

10:16.866 --> 10:19.577
If I've said it once,
I've said it a thousand times.

10:31.548 --> 10:35.051
You son of a bitch!
I told you not to grab my wood!

10:38.221 --> 10:39.264
Do you believe me now?

10:41.015 --> 10:42.350
This way.

10:46.062 --> 10:47.147
So long, Bill.

12:44.180 --> 12:45.890
-Clear.
-Clear.

12:45.974 --> 12:48.017
No sign of a struggle.

12:48.101 --> 12:50.436
Like they vanished into thin air.

12:50.520 --> 12:53.314
Supplies are all still here.
Even ammo. It makes no sense.

12:53.398 --> 12:55.775
Why am I not surprised?

12:55.858 --> 12:58.319
We need to get these vehicles started
and get back to camp.

13:06.369 --> 13:07.412
Czarnecki!

13:10.164 --> 13:11.499
What do you see?

13:12.542 --> 13:13.918
-There's a--
-[gunshot]

13:14.002 --> 13:16.087
-Take cover! Take cover!
-[Czarnecki groaning]

13:19.966 --> 13:21.342
Ah, crap.

13:25.221 --> 13:26.806
Private! Down!

13:27.890 --> 13:29.225
I gotta get Czarnecki!

13:29.308 --> 13:31.310
Stay down! That's an order, Private!

13:31.394 --> 13:32.562
[bullet whizzes]

13:36.190 --> 13:38.443
Damn it. Where's it coming from, kid?

14:04.469 --> 14:06.721
-Think I got him.
-Son of a bitch.

14:10.433 --> 14:12.602
Czarnecki! Can you stand?

14:12.685 --> 14:16.689
That's a negative, sir. I'm bleeding out.
[groans and coughs]

14:16.773 --> 14:18.357
Hold on!

14:20.193 --> 14:21.944
-Lieutenant!
-I'm good!

14:23.738 --> 14:26.032
The kid's a helluva shot, sir!

14:26.115 --> 14:27.575
If you got it, take it!

14:32.121 --> 14:33.414
Mayday, mayday.

14:33.498 --> 14:36.250
Doc, this is Red.
What's happening over there?

14:36.334 --> 14:39.045
<i>We're pinned. Sniper. We got a man down.</i>

14:39.128 --> 14:41.130
<i>Everybody's gone. The trucks.
There's no convoy.</i>

14:41.214 --> 14:42.298
What do you mean?

14:42.382 --> 14:44.884
<i>Damn. Red, everybody's gone.
They left the trucks behind.</i>

14:44.967 --> 14:46.719
What are your coordinates?
We'll send help.

14:46.803 --> 14:48.721
<i>-Every...
-Doc?</i>

14:48.805 --> 14:51.516
<i>-Every... Gone!
-Doc?</i>

14:51.599 --> 14:53.142
<i>-Red?
-10K!</i>

14:53.226 --> 14:54.811
We're coming to help. Where are you?

14:54.894 --> 14:58.022
<i>Stay put. Don't worry.
I'll be seeing you soon.</i>

14:58.106 --> 14:59.107
[static]

15:00.149 --> 15:01.609
Was that the Lieutenant?

15:01.692 --> 15:04.612
-Yeah. Um, we got cut off.
-Did they find the convoy?

15:06.280 --> 15:08.908
They're on their way.
I gotta talk to the doctor.

15:09.367 --> 15:11.869
-W-wait, did-- did they say when?
-We're fine. Don't worry.

15:20.128 --> 15:21.212
I just heard from them.

15:26.008 --> 15:28.928
-They're under attack.
-Did you get their position?

15:29.011 --> 15:30.138
They cut out.

15:33.850 --> 15:35.309
There's no convoy.

15:35.393 --> 15:39.897
They found the vehicles,
but they were abandoned.

15:39.981 --> 15:42.859
I couldn't tell the others.
I can't let them lose all hope.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.068
You did the right thing.

15:46.529 --> 15:47.655
Hand me that.

16:08.593 --> 16:09.760
We need uniforms.

16:09.844 --> 16:12.054
Is this really the best time
to be thinking about fashion?

16:12.138 --> 16:15.600
To get on the helicopter. They're only
evacuating a few unvaccinated soldiers.

16:15.683 --> 16:17.310
Otherwise, they'll never
let us leave willingly.

16:17.393 --> 16:19.103
-Who won't?
-Everyone.

16:19.187 --> 16:22.231
What did you mean when you said
that everything will make sense in time?

16:22.315 --> 16:24.108
-[crash]
-No!

16:24.192 --> 16:25.234
[whimpering]

16:27.695 --> 16:28.946
[screams]

16:29.030 --> 16:30.448
Come on.

16:36.829 --> 16:38.873
-What's wrong with the vaccine?
-It's failing.

16:38.956 --> 16:40.958
That's why they're all losing their minds.

16:41.042 --> 16:44.712
The first indications are mild dementia,
soon followed by homicidal psychosis.

16:44.795 --> 16:47.215
That's quite a leap.
There's no in-between phase?

16:47.298 --> 16:48.299
I'm afraid not.

16:48.382 --> 16:51.010
Apparently in addition to
the antibodies for the zombie virus,

16:51.093 --> 16:53.429
your blood contained contaminates.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.306
Contaminates? Says who?

16:55.389 --> 16:57.683
We don't even know what it is yet.

16:57.767 --> 17:00.811
The first people vaccinated
are already suffering side effects.

17:00.895 --> 17:04.232
Within the next 72 hours,
everyone who's received the vaccine,

17:04.315 --> 17:07.610
will descend into
complete predatory madness.

17:07.693 --> 17:09.529
That seems to be a pattern these days.

17:09.612 --> 17:12.823
What about us? Are we infected?

17:12.907 --> 17:15.826
You're the only ones
who never received the vaccine.

17:15.910 --> 17:18.829
Murphy didn't get it because he's Murphy.
He already had the immunity.

17:18.913 --> 17:20.957
And you because you were in a coma.

17:22.416 --> 17:23.501
What about you?

17:25.586 --> 17:29.131
[door opens, distant shouting]

17:29.215 --> 17:30.299
Let's go.

17:40.560 --> 17:43.145
Well, that's unpleasant.
Wait a minute.

17:44.814 --> 17:46.065
I know these people.

17:49.193 --> 17:52.446
These are my people. My Blends.

17:54.740 --> 17:57.034
It's Leon. Melissa.

17:58.953 --> 18:01.789
No, not little Tommy.

18:01.872 --> 18:03.833
Did they bring them here for their blood?

18:03.916 --> 18:05.793
Before we had Murphy, yes.

18:07.837 --> 18:12.383
Trust me, these are the lucky ones.
Let's go. We're running out of time.

18:14.844 --> 18:16.512
Hey.

18:16.596 --> 18:17.805
Come on.

18:25.521 --> 18:28.357
-[groans]
-Come on, man! You gotta crawl!

18:34.322 --> 18:37.283
I doubt he can hear you, sir!
Looks like he's losing consciousness.

18:37.366 --> 18:38.826
Sir, let me get him.

18:38.909 --> 18:41.871
That's a negative, soldier.
I can't afford to lose two right now.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.706
He's gonna die if we don't get him.

18:43.789 --> 18:46.208
Well, even if we do, we gotta get
all the way back to camp.

18:48.878 --> 18:50.963
We may need to take the merciful approach.

18:55.676 --> 18:56.844
How many, kid?

18:56.927 --> 18:59.722
Just one shooter, but I'm seeing movement.
He's not alone.

19:18.407 --> 19:21.118
Turn that cabin into swiss cheese, kid.

19:37.760 --> 19:41.055
10K will be okay. I know it.

19:41.138 --> 19:43.808
I know.

19:43.891 --> 19:46.769
But it's hard to sit still here,
knowing what I know.

19:52.858 --> 19:55.695
Hope is contagious.

19:55.778 --> 19:59.156
So is the opposite.

19:59.240 --> 20:02.410
Doc said the people
from the convoy disappeared.

20:02.493 --> 20:04.829
Like they were never even there.

20:07.123 --> 20:08.207
He sounded shook up.

20:14.171 --> 20:15.715
Nothing's worse than not knowing.

20:21.470 --> 20:24.348
10K? Doc?

20:25.850 --> 20:28.185
Can you hear me? Over.

20:28.269 --> 20:29.395
Anyone.

20:50.040 --> 20:52.543
-Oh. That's unpleasant.
-Oh, hey, Murph.

21:10.311 --> 21:11.896
[taser clicking, man screams]

21:28.621 --> 21:30.206
[yelps]

21:34.794 --> 21:36.837
Damn rotator cuff.

21:42.134 --> 21:43.302
You okay?

21:50.226 --> 21:52.853
The uniforms. Put them on.

22:12.206 --> 22:15.000
He's suffered enough! Show him some mercy.

22:32.476 --> 22:34.770
-You all right, kid?
-God dammit.

22:44.113 --> 22:45.698
You!

22:45.781 --> 22:49.243
Get over here! Get on that gun!

22:53.581 --> 22:55.666
Pick it up.

22:55.749 --> 22:58.836
You kill him or we kill you.

23:48.302 --> 23:49.928
[gunshots]

24:03.442 --> 24:04.485
Damn.

24:14.411 --> 24:15.537
Are they even zombies?

24:15.621 --> 24:17.414
No, something else.
We don't know what yet.

24:17.498 --> 24:20.376
What, another plague?
I can't. I just can't.

24:20.459 --> 24:22.169
[snarling]

24:22.252 --> 24:24.797
We need to go through the residence
to get to the helipad.

24:24.880 --> 24:26.382
Is he even still here?

24:27.841 --> 24:29.843
Oh, that's not good.

24:46.735 --> 24:49.697
Teller? What do you want?

24:49.780 --> 24:52.574
Uh, w-we need to get through, sir.
To the stairwell.

24:52.658 --> 24:53.826
Why?

24:53.909 --> 24:56.161
The next flight out,
they need to get on it.

24:56.245 --> 24:57.371
-Says who?
-Reset Command, sir. They needed more men.

24:59.540 --> 25:02.042
-Nobody told me.
-I understand.

25:02.126 --> 25:05.212
We didn't wanna burden you
with everything that's happening.

25:05.295 --> 25:07.256
And what is happening?

25:07.339 --> 25:09.633
Well, sir, I'm not sure
how much you're aware of.

25:09.717 --> 25:12.094
But things have taken a turn.

25:13.595 --> 25:19.518
I'll tell you what I am aware of.
The spreading of misinformation.

25:20.144 --> 25:25.065
It's insidious, and quite frankly,
it has to stop.

25:25.149 --> 25:26.900
These are problematic times, sir.

25:26.984 --> 25:31.321
You think you know what's happening.
But you don't.

25:31.405 --> 25:32.573
About what, sir?

25:37.327 --> 25:39.371
The bigger picture.

25:39.455 --> 25:44.626
Which makes you, precisely the most
dangerous man on the Earth.

25:45.878 --> 25:49.590
Are you aware
of the Dunning-Kruger effect?

25:49.673 --> 25:50.841
Excuse me, sir?

25:50.924 --> 25:56.263
It states that the most ignorant
ten percent of a group,

25:57.181 --> 26:01.518
believe that they have
comparable knowledge to those around them.

26:01.685 --> 26:04.855
They don't understand that--
that they don't know.

26:06.356 --> 26:11.653
They don't have that information,
so they assume that they do

26:11.737 --> 26:16.325
have the same information
as those who actually know!

26:16.408 --> 26:19.828
-Are you following me?
-Sir, we need to get on that helicopter.

26:19.912 --> 26:21.330
I don't think you do!

26:23.665 --> 26:26.043
-Alvin!
-Hey, buddy.

26:26.126 --> 26:30.464
[chuckles] My beautiful boy.
We missed you at bridge.

26:31.381 --> 26:34.134
I've been missing a lot of stuff lately.

26:34.218 --> 26:37.179
It's disappointing to say the least.

26:37.262 --> 26:38.472
What brings you here?

26:38.555 --> 26:42.976
Oh, uh, you know... little chopper ride.

26:43.101 --> 26:44.603
I love chopper rides!

26:46.355 --> 26:48.690
Y-you're not going to leave, are you?

26:48.774 --> 26:51.944
Oh, no, no, no. Not for good.

26:52.027 --> 26:53.695
Well...

26:53.779 --> 26:57.449
Who-- who is going to host the...

26:57.533 --> 26:59.535
the show?

26:59.618 --> 27:01.161
-Oh, the talent show?
-Yes.

27:01.245 --> 27:04.414
-Oh, that's still a few weeks away.
-But we have preparation.

27:04.498 --> 27:09.545
You know, I'm sure Eisenrich
can handle all the basic preparations.

27:09.628 --> 27:11.964
I'll just come in the end
to clean it up, you know?

27:12.047 --> 27:14.091
Ah. [chuckles]

27:15.467 --> 27:20.138
Do you remember last season?
Maybe it was the one before.

27:20.222 --> 27:23.350
We accidentally...

27:23.433 --> 27:25.435
lit Robertson on fire.

27:25.519 --> 27:26.937
[both laugh]

27:27.020 --> 27:30.691
How could I forget? You know,
he was a pretty good sport about that.

27:32.651 --> 27:35.487
It was the most fun I've ever had.
[laughs]

27:35.571 --> 27:39.366
I think that was the same night
that we drank all of Sichting's cognac,

27:39.449 --> 27:42.744
and drove the Bentley into the lake.
[laughs]

27:43.787 --> 27:46.665
-No, that was the second time.
-[coughing]

27:51.962 --> 27:53.130
[breathing deeply]

28:00.762 --> 28:02.973
Perhaps you're right.
My memory, it...

28:06.059 --> 28:07.603
It fails me.

28:07.686 --> 28:11.690
Yeah. You know, I wonder how he's healed.
You know, it's been some time.

28:11.773 --> 28:13.692
-Who cares?
-True.

28:14.985 --> 28:19.907
I have big plans for you, my boy.

28:19.990 --> 28:23.702
And I want you by my side at all times.

28:23.785 --> 28:28.040
-And I mean, at all times.
-And I want to be there.

28:28.123 --> 28:31.877
Whether I'm enjoying a lovely meal,
or passing water,

28:31.960 --> 28:34.588
I want you right there.

28:34.671 --> 28:37.215
Uh-- [chuckles] And I will be.

28:37.299 --> 28:40.636
But right now, we gotta go.

28:40.719 --> 28:45.432
You have no idea what's in store.
Such glorious things.

28:46.892 --> 28:50.354
In time, it will all be new soon.

28:50.437 --> 28:51.521
But-- but first...

28:53.398 --> 28:55.400
The Reset.

28:55.484 --> 28:58.612
The Reset. Right. Alrighty then.

28:58.695 --> 29:00.781
Well, I'll be seeing you.

29:03.784 --> 29:05.494
[mouths words]

29:14.378 --> 29:18.006
[breathes deeply, sighs]

29:18.090 --> 29:19.424
[chuckles]

29:35.732 --> 29:36.900
Damn, there's no end to this.

29:42.823 --> 29:44.324
We gotta show him some mercy!

29:45.450 --> 29:48.495
On three, everyone lays down fire.

29:48.578 --> 29:50.497
Lilley, you got a clean shot on him?

29:55.961 --> 29:57.212
Lilley?

30:00.299 --> 30:01.717
Yes, sir!

30:01.800 --> 30:05.595
On three! All right, here we go. One!

30:07.723 --> 30:10.559
Two! Three!

30:44.718 --> 30:45.802
Look!

31:02.944 --> 31:04.738
-You mercied him?
-Yes, sir!

31:04.821 --> 31:07.949
That was a head shot, man.
What the hell is going on?

31:18.293 --> 31:19.294
Damn.

31:23.256 --> 31:24.299
What the hell?

31:26.218 --> 31:27.469
[gunshot]

31:32.891 --> 31:34.893
[gunshots]

31:56.706 --> 31:57.749
What the hell?

32:03.422 --> 32:04.881
No!

32:07.717 --> 32:09.094
[no voice]

32:20.856 --> 32:22.566
Fall back!

32:22.649 --> 32:25.110
Fall back! Fall back!
We're going to the trucks!

32:25.193 --> 32:26.486
Go, go, go, go!

32:45.755 --> 32:47.132
Go.

32:50.427 --> 32:51.928
No.

32:52.012 --> 32:55.765
Go, I'll find you. Get to Newmerica.

32:59.769 --> 33:00.854
Get outta here!

33:14.743 --> 33:15.869
Let go of me!

33:18.622 --> 33:19.998
[grunting]

33:22.709 --> 33:23.835
Let me go!

33:35.680 --> 33:37.891
[screaming]

33:44.564 --> 33:46.107
[engine starts]

33:58.411 --> 33:59.496
[woman] Addy.

34:01.331 --> 34:03.250
<i>-</i>Addy.
-[whimpering]

34:03.333 --> 34:06.336
Addy!Go.

34:07.128 --> 34:10.924
Find the others, stay together.
I'll find you.

34:11.007 --> 34:12.133
Get to Newmerica.

37:08.226 --> 37:09.310
Helipad.

37:09.394 --> 37:12.147
[female voice]
<i>Of course, right away.</i>

37:12.230 --> 37:14.107
What happened to you back there?

37:14.190 --> 37:16.401
You looked like you went somewhere.

37:16.484 --> 37:18.069
I don't know.

37:18.153 --> 37:21.364
I don't know if it's a dream, a vision,
or a memory I can't hold.

37:21.448 --> 37:23.992
The more I think about it,
the farther it recedes.

37:24.075 --> 37:27.370
It's possible that something
is triggering these visions,

37:27.454 --> 37:29.289
interrupting your reality.

37:29.372 --> 37:33.042
It's totally common with people
waking from a comatose state.

37:33.126 --> 37:34.586
Where are we going anyway?

37:34.669 --> 37:37.881
What are we gonna do out there?
It's the apocalypse, for Christ's sake.

37:37.964 --> 37:39.632
There's something I have to tell you.

37:41.718 --> 37:43.136
Your daughter's alive.

37:44.596 --> 37:47.098
Lucy?

37:47.182 --> 37:48.391
How do you know that?

37:48.475 --> 37:50.977
Murphy. Murphy. Murphy.

37:55.148 --> 37:59.569
The population has been depleted,
but there's a small group of survivors,

37:59.652 --> 38:02.697
and they are led by military personnel.

38:02.781 --> 38:04.908
They've set up a refugee camp.

38:04.991 --> 38:08.077
There's an outpost in the North,
and they're all heading there.

38:08.161 --> 38:10.872
How do we find them?

38:10.955 --> 38:15.502
These are GPS coordinates.
The chopper will get you to the mainland.

38:15.585 --> 38:17.837
But from there,
you'll have to find your own way.

38:17.921 --> 38:20.006
Hey. What about you?

38:20.089 --> 38:21.841
-I'm staying here.
-Why?

38:21.925 --> 38:24.886
[coughs] You better get going.

38:24.969 --> 38:26.179
Why?

38:28.431 --> 38:30.266
These visions that you're having...

38:31.935 --> 38:33.978
don't ignore them.

38:34.062 --> 38:37.315
The unconscious is a very powerful thing.

38:42.237 --> 38:45.740
-The vaccine, you took it, too?
-Get going.

38:52.831 --> 38:54.874
[roaring]

39:15.562 --> 39:17.397
[both grunting]

39:34.372 --> 39:35.623
Thank you.

39:37.292 --> 39:39.544
-Yeah.
-We gotta move.

40:18.625 --> 40:20.209
Where the hell is everyone?

40:22.420 --> 40:23.546
Red.

40:29.385 --> 40:32.597
Red! Red?

40:34.974 --> 40:36.059
Red?!

40:40.104 --> 40:41.105
They're gone.

40:41.189 --> 40:44.067
All the gear is still here.
Just like the convoy.

40:44.150 --> 40:45.401
Makes no sense.

40:46.152 --> 40:48.571
-Red?
-Hey! 10K!

40:52.951 --> 40:55.620
-Red!
-10K! What are you doing, man?

40:58.331 --> 40:59.457
Damn!

41:17.266 --> 41:19.852
Do you believe Teller? About Lucy?

41:19.936 --> 41:22.230
-I believe it.
-I can't feel her.

41:22.313 --> 41:23.731
-At all.
-I can.
