WEBVTT

00:02.203 --> 00:04.437
So i heard you got a rape case
where the victim got burned up.

00:04.438 --> 00:06.672
Nurse from chicago med.
Raped, beaten.

00:06.674 --> 00:08.039
Perp torched the joint.

00:08.042 --> 00:09.708
Fire department!
Call out!

00:09.710 --> 00:11.477
Help me.

00:11.479 --> 00:14.146
Third-degree burns and
severe smoke inhalation.

00:14.148 --> 00:15.314
If you're looking to
kill somebody,

00:15.316 --> 00:17.282
Toxic smoke will
do the job fast.

00:17.284 --> 00:19.284
(rollins)
okay, so confirmed victim's
a nurse.

00:19.286 --> 00:21.453
5'5", brown hair, brown eyes.

00:21.455 --> 00:22.454
And she was raped.

00:22.456 --> 00:24.056
Think he did it before?

00:24.058 --> 00:26.325
Unfortunately...

00:26.327 --> 00:27.593
I know he has.

00:30.664 --> 00:33.799
[indistinct pa announcement]

00:33.801 --> 00:36.635
[sighs]

00:42.743 --> 00:44.777
Hey.

00:44.779 --> 00:46.612
- Oh, thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

00:51.118 --> 00:52.618
So?

00:52.620 --> 00:56.088
Third-degree burns
over 75% of her body.

00:56.090 --> 00:57.589
The damage
goes through to the muscle.

00:57.591 --> 01:00.092
Nerves are completely gone.

01:00.094 --> 01:01.760
The only good news right now

01:01.762 --> 01:04.063
Is that she probably
can't feel anything.

01:04.065 --> 01:05.764
Okay, any chance
she'll pull through?

01:05.766 --> 01:07.566
Even if we could hold off
the infection,

01:07.568 --> 01:08.567
And we'll do our best--

01:08.569 --> 01:10.235
Can she talk?

01:10.237 --> 01:12.237
She's coherent at the moment.

01:12.239 --> 01:13.672
So she can talk.

01:13.674 --> 01:17.810
Look, we're here to find out
who did this,

01:17.812 --> 01:20.079
So i think if she was able,

01:20.081 --> 01:22.448
She'd want to talk to us.

01:22.450 --> 01:24.349
Stay here.

01:24.351 --> 01:26.418
All right, thanks, man.

01:29.090 --> 01:30.422
Victim's sister's
on her way in.

01:30.424 --> 01:34.460
Have olinsky and atwater
talk to her, okay?

01:38.365 --> 01:42.634
- Hey.
- How's victoria? Any word?

01:42.636 --> 01:44.470
I saw the crime scene.
It can't be good.

01:44.472 --> 01:45.871
What happened?

01:45.873 --> 01:47.606
Fire department found her
in a burning building.

01:47.608 --> 01:49.741
She's got burns
all over her body.

01:49.743 --> 01:53.579
Her skull was fractured, and
she'd been sexually assaulted.

01:53.581 --> 01:56.882
This is--it's just horrible.

01:56.884 --> 01:59.651
She's the nicest person.

01:59.653 --> 02:01.253
You know her?

02:01.255 --> 02:03.188
Just in passing.

02:03.190 --> 02:07.559
She's a nurse
in maternity.

02:07.561 --> 02:10.395
Any idea who did it?

02:10.396 --> 02:12.698
Would i be standing here
if i did?

02:16.837 --> 02:18.437
- Keep it short.
- Okay.

02:18.439 --> 02:19.438
Thanks.

02:19.440 --> 02:21.240
[monitor beeping]

02:21.242 --> 02:24.309
[labored breathing]

02:29.350 --> 02:31.483
Victoria?

02:31.485 --> 02:35.420
Victoria, i'm sergeant benson.

02:36.524 --> 02:39.858
I'm so sorry.

02:39.860 --> 02:44.263
Do you remember anything about
the man who did this to you?

02:46.934 --> 02:51.503
I was in back of my building,

02:51.505 --> 02:54.506
Taking out the trash.

02:54.508 --> 02:55.774
Okay.

02:55.776 --> 02:59.878
Corner of my eye,

02:59.880 --> 03:03.916
Man in hospital scrubs

03:03.918 --> 03:05.884
Walking up behind me.

03:05.886 --> 03:08.353
I turned.

03:09.757 --> 03:14.593
I woke up,
i was in my apartment,

03:14.595 --> 03:17.362
And the wall was on fire.

03:17.364 --> 03:18.830
[crying]

03:18.832 --> 03:20.933
It's okay.

03:24.905 --> 03:26.972
Did you see his face?

03:26.974 --> 03:30.242
[crying]

03:32.279 --> 03:34.546
No.

03:37.418 --> 03:40.385
He was white.

03:40.387 --> 03:42.821
A little under 6 feet.

03:42.823 --> 03:43.822
Okay.

03:43.824 --> 03:45.257
[monitor sounding]

03:45.259 --> 03:46.858
All right, that's it.
That's it. Out of the way!

03:46.860 --> 03:47.859
Call the code!

03:47.861 --> 03:49.261
(woman)
code 2 call.

03:49.263 --> 03:50.729
[alarm beeping]

03:50.731 --> 03:52.598
(woman)
all right, check breathing.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.766
And prepping cpr.

03:54.768 --> 03:57.970
- Push...
- [gasping]

03:59.006 --> 04:00.772
[blows nose]

04:00.774 --> 04:02.374
I'm so sorry.

04:02.376 --> 04:04.443
Here. Sit here.

04:06.480 --> 04:07.646
We are too.

04:07.648 --> 04:11.984
I mean, it's--
it's hard to believe

04:11.986 --> 04:14.620
Something like this happening,
you know?

04:14.622 --> 04:16.654
Victoria was supposed
to come over tonight.

04:16.656 --> 04:19.757
Um, was she seeing anyone?

04:19.760 --> 04:21.493
No.

04:21.495 --> 04:23.495
Was there anybody
in victoria's life

04:23.497 --> 04:26.565
That you think was aggressive
at work or...

04:26.567 --> 04:29.768
No.
I mean, that would do this?

04:31.438 --> 04:34.273
I'm sorry, i just

04:34.275 --> 04:37.376
Can't imagine
what she went through.

04:37.378 --> 04:40.746
All that pain.
I just can't--

04:40.748 --> 04:44.349
Hey, it's okay.

04:44.351 --> 04:47.419
[crying]

04:53.627 --> 04:55.794
So the first victim,
alice whitlock,

04:55.796 --> 04:57.329
Raped and murdered.

04:57.331 --> 04:59.431
Cause of death
was blunt force trauma

04:59.433 --> 05:00.799
To the back of the skull.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.768
Blunt force trauma.

05:02.770 --> 05:05.337
She was a nurse
at columbia presbyterian.

05:05.339 --> 05:07.406
Second vic, lisa hoffman,

05:07.408 --> 05:10.075
She was raped and killed
in the same fashion as whitlock,

05:10.077 --> 05:13.612
But she was found completely
burned in her own car

05:13.614 --> 05:15.380
Along the harlem river.

05:15.382 --> 05:18.483
Green nail polish was applied
to both of these victims

05:18.485 --> 05:20.085
At some point during the crime.

05:20.087 --> 05:25.057
Debra mcculloch was last seen
exiting a bar on 53rd and 3rd.

05:25.059 --> 05:27.059
She was a nurse at mount sinai.

05:27.061 --> 05:32.664
So all three victims
in new york, 2004.

05:32.666 --> 05:33.932
Witnesses were consistent.

05:33.934 --> 05:36.635
They all saw a man
in medical clothing

05:36.637 --> 05:38.937
And his arm in a sling
approaching these women.

05:38.939 --> 05:41.373
The victim from here,
she have green nail polish on?

05:41.375 --> 05:43.125
Don't know yet.

05:43.126 --> 05:44.876
Lab tech's gonna check
when the doctor gives the okay,

05:44.878 --> 05:47.079
But there's no guarantees
we'll find out either way.

05:47.081 --> 05:48.814
Her hands were severely burned.

05:48.816 --> 05:50.549
She was trying
to cover her face.

05:50.551 --> 05:51.950
Also, there was no dna

05:51.952 --> 05:53.952
At either
of the new york crime scenes.

05:53.954 --> 05:56.621
Any theories
why he stopped for ten years?

05:56.623 --> 05:59.391
Sadly, we don't know
that he has.

05:59.393 --> 06:03.729
So our suspect is
a male, white, 5'9",

06:03.731 --> 06:05.397
Approximately 40 years old.

06:05.399 --> 06:06.765
He's either in the medical field

06:06.767 --> 06:08.934
Or, obviously,
posing as somebody who is.

06:08.936 --> 06:10.902
There's nothing physically
distinctive about him.

06:10.904 --> 06:13.071
All the witnesses,
again, were consistent.

06:13.073 --> 06:15.424
When they described him,

06:15.425 --> 06:17.776
They said that he was
average-looking and normal.

06:17.778 --> 06:19.578
These details of the crimes

06:19.579 --> 06:21.379
Have gone out to every news
and radio station in town.

06:21.382 --> 06:23.548
We check city wide
and in the suburbs

06:23.550 --> 06:26.485
On missile x cards
and information reports

06:26.487 --> 06:28.520
On any attempted abductions
or suspicious calls.

06:28.522 --> 06:29.788
[phone rings]

06:29.790 --> 06:31.723
I'm gonna have mouse
triangulate the cell towers

06:31.725 --> 06:34.626
On the girl's phone
and check all social media.

06:34.628 --> 06:35.961
We can find out
if she electronically

06:35.963 --> 06:36.962
Checked in anywhere
during the day.

06:36.964 --> 06:38.013
Thanks.

06:38.014 --> 06:39.063
I'll check
the sex offender files

06:39.066 --> 06:40.065
And recently released parolees.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.533
Good.

06:41.535 --> 06:44.803
That was olinsky
at chicago med.

06:44.805 --> 06:47.139
Victoria didn't make it.

06:50.677 --> 06:52.744
Let's get to work.

06:56.950 --> 06:58.150
[sighs]

07:04.691 --> 07:05.690
We'll get him.

07:05.692 --> 07:07.692
Yeah, yeah, we will.

07:07.694 --> 07:10.695
[dramatic music]

Yep.

07:25.546 --> 07:27.012
- Mind holding?
[phone rings]

07:27.014 --> 07:28.713
I need to put you on hold.

07:28.715 --> 07:31.450
Well, i'm putting you on hold.

07:31.452 --> 07:32.818
Start taking statements.

07:32.820 --> 07:35.554
All these people
think they've seen this guy.

07:35.556 --> 07:36.988
Work left to right.

07:36.990 --> 07:38.156
Our left or your left?

07:38.158 --> 07:40.192
Both. Neither.

07:40.194 --> 07:42.727
Forget i said anything.
Just take their statements.

07:44.898 --> 07:46.565
Hey, i'm so sorry i'm late.

07:46.567 --> 07:49.468
Lindsay's 30th
has me totally scrambled.

07:49.470 --> 07:50.969
Can you hold me
behind the desk for me?

07:50.971 --> 07:53.472
Everyone in the metro area
thinks they saw this guy.

07:53.474 --> 07:54.973
Whatever i can do to help.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.608
The hotline rings
on your phone.

07:56.610 --> 07:58.610
Since you were late,
i had it transferred down here,

07:58.612 --> 08:00.946
So plant your ass upstairs
and start taking notes.

08:00.948 --> 08:03.114
You got it. Thank you.

08:03.116 --> 08:06.084
Okay, guys,
cross-match any details

08:06.086 --> 08:08.220
From the chicago case
with ours,

08:08.222 --> 08:10.222
And i'm gonna
need all of our files

08:10.224 --> 08:12.991
Electronically scanned and sent,
like, yesterday.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.526
We're on it.

08:14.528 --> 08:19.030
Why don't you bring them out
yourself?

08:19.032 --> 08:20.966
We could use all the help
we can get.

08:20.968 --> 08:23.034
We're happy to do it.

08:23.036 --> 08:26.705
Okay, guys,
then get on the next flight.

08:26.707 --> 08:28.073
Bring the files.

08:28.075 --> 08:30.809
Have rollins and carisi
reopen the investigation,

08:30.811 --> 08:31.810
Okay, from there.

08:31.812 --> 08:33.245
- Got it.
- Great.

08:33.246 --> 08:35.580
Thanks, guys.
See you soon.

08:35.582 --> 08:37.716
(ruzek)
so he was dressed as a doctor,
arm in a sling,

08:37.717 --> 08:40.284
Hanging out around the building
just down the block.

08:40.287 --> 08:42.254
This is five days ago.

08:42.256 --> 08:44.556
- Anything? No?
- No.

08:46.560 --> 08:48.026
Offender balled up newspaper

08:48.028 --> 08:52.097
And shredded rubber,
piled it near the victim.

08:52.099 --> 08:54.733
Then he left a trail of
the same combo to the back door.

08:54.735 --> 08:58.036
Used lighter fluid
as an accelerant, lit it,

08:58.038 --> 09:00.972
And then left
out the back door.

09:03.243 --> 09:05.143
Some burning rubber

09:05.145 --> 09:09.848
Dropped down a coax cable hole
in the floor, right here,

09:09.850 --> 09:13.251
Which is why we initially
thought it started downstairs.

09:14.988 --> 09:20.725
Okay, so the offender
drags the victim

09:20.727 --> 09:25.597
Up the back staircase
into the bedroom.

09:27.234 --> 09:30.302
There's no way we're pulling
any dna out of here.

09:30.304 --> 09:32.637
No.

09:32.639 --> 09:35.607
I heard whoever did this
has done it before?

09:36.710 --> 09:39.077
Yeah, it's looking like it.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.079
[scoffs]

09:41.081 --> 09:42.247
[lindsay sighs]

09:45.719 --> 09:47.786
Check it out.

09:49.990 --> 09:52.291
It's nail polish.

09:52.292 --> 09:54.593
What color did the offender
use on the victims?

09:54.595 --> 09:56.194
Green.

09:57.331 --> 10:00.098
[dramatic music]

10:00.100 --> 10:01.733
Well, now there's no doubt.

10:09.376 --> 10:10.826
(ruzek)
all right, listen, ask around.

10:10.827 --> 10:12.277
If anybody's seen
anything like that, please,

10:12.279 --> 10:13.678
Give 21st district a call.

10:13.680 --> 10:14.679
We appreciate it.

10:14.681 --> 10:17.315
Thank you.

10:17.317 --> 10:19.117
All right, listen,
i'll start knocking on doors.

10:19.119 --> 10:20.385
Somebody's got to have
a security system

10:20.387 --> 10:21.820
Around here or saw something.

10:21.822 --> 10:23.989
The g also hides cameras
all over the place,

10:23.991 --> 10:25.924
So have mouse request
all the ip addresses

10:25.926 --> 10:26.925
In a four-block vicinity.

10:26.927 --> 10:27.926
Okay.

10:27.928 --> 10:29.027
[phone rings]

10:29.029 --> 10:31.863

10:31.865 --> 10:32.864
[phone rings]

10:32.866 --> 10:34.132
Sorry.

10:34.134 --> 10:38.136
Chicago police intelligence,
can you hold?

10:38.138 --> 10:41.740
There's 150 places that sell
medical supplies in chicago,

10:41.742 --> 10:43.458
So we're reaching out

10:43.459 --> 10:45.175
To see if any of them have sold
an arm sling to someone

10:45.178 --> 10:47.178
Fitting our description
in the last three months

10:47.180 --> 10:48.413
And if there's
video surveillance.

10:48.415 --> 10:49.381
Patrol's helping out.

10:49.383 --> 10:50.849
Yeah, well,
we also need a list

10:50.851 --> 10:53.385
Of every doctor, surgeon,
nurse, x-ray tech,

10:53.387 --> 10:55.086
Dentist, orderly, janitor,

10:55.088 --> 10:56.855
Anybody in the medical field
who wears scrubs.

10:56.857 --> 10:58.790
Ah, don't forget
mental institutions.

10:58.792 --> 11:01.192
Yeah, and check practicing
and non-practicing.

11:01.194 --> 11:04.229
[phone vibrates]
- benson.

11:04.231 --> 11:06.131
Hey, sarge, you alone?

11:06.133 --> 11:08.099
Close enough.
What's up?

11:08.101 --> 11:10.135
Well, i'm going
over the witness statements

11:10.137 --> 11:12.370
From the debra mcculloch
disappearance in '04.

11:12.372 --> 11:15.273
Detectives interviewed
a med student who knew debra

11:15.275 --> 11:17.275
Named will halstead.

11:17.277 --> 11:19.077
The name bumped for rollins,
so we did some digging.

11:19.079 --> 11:22.781
It turns out he's a doctor
at chicago med right now.

11:22.783 --> 11:23.782
Okay.

11:23.784 --> 11:25.917
And his brother, jay,

11:25.919 --> 11:27.786
He's a detective
in voight's unit.

11:27.788 --> 11:30.088
I see. Go on.

11:30.090 --> 11:32.991
And i'm guessing
you can't really talk right now.

11:32.993 --> 11:34.859
Good luck, sarge.

11:34.861 --> 11:36.261
Good to know.

11:36.263 --> 11:38.463
Thank you.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.867
(halstead)
all good?

11:42.869 --> 11:44.235
Oh, yeah.
That's, uh--

11:44.237 --> 11:47.038
That was just my son's nanny
checking in.

11:49.976 --> 11:51.376
Okay.

11:56.883 --> 11:59.417
[rock music]

11:59.419 --> 12:01.953
- Hank.
- Olivia.

12:01.955 --> 12:04.189
Hey.

12:04.191 --> 12:06.024
I went ahead
and ordered you a manhattan.

12:06.026 --> 12:08.159
I see, and i'm gonna go ahead
and drink it.

12:08.161 --> 12:10.729
Cheers.

12:10.731 --> 12:12.797
So i got to run something
past you.

12:12.799 --> 12:14.866
Okay.

12:14.868 --> 12:18.203
Detective halstead, uh,
his brother will,

12:18.205 --> 12:20.138
You know him?

12:20.140 --> 12:22.273
A little.

12:22.275 --> 12:26.377
So my ex-partner
questioned him ten years ago.

12:26.379 --> 12:29.147
He knew one of the victims
in the new york.

12:29.149 --> 12:31.282
I'd like to bring him in,
you know,

12:31.284 --> 12:32.784
Ask him a few questions,

12:32.786 --> 12:35.086
Just check his temperature.

12:38.458 --> 12:41.226
Without jay knowing
why you're bringing will in?

12:41.228 --> 12:42.761
That's correct.

12:42.763 --> 12:45.396
You want to ambush will.

12:45.398 --> 12:46.865
[sighs]
well, i wouldn't--

12:46.867 --> 12:50.335
That's okay. I mean,
you can call it what it is.

12:50.337 --> 12:53.138
Yes, i want to ambush will.

12:53.140 --> 12:54.906
Hmm.

12:54.908 --> 12:57.408
Look, he knew the woman
who went missing in new york,

12:57.410 --> 12:59.944
And now, suddenly,
the killer activates

12:59.946 --> 13:04.382
After he gets a job
at chicago med.

13:05.919 --> 13:10.488
I've been carrying around
this case for ten years.

13:10.490 --> 13:14.526
I just need to see the look
on his face.

13:14.528 --> 13:16.561
Look, i know
this is your house,

13:16.563 --> 13:17.896
And i don't want
to disrespect you.

13:17.898 --> 13:20.032
- That's why i just...
- Yeah.

13:20.033 --> 13:22.167
I wanted to run it past you.
Just--

13:22.169 --> 13:26.104
Let me think about it.

13:26.106 --> 13:27.172
Okay.

13:39.419 --> 13:41.119
Thanks, sarge.
We got it from here.

13:41.121 --> 13:45.323
Uh, sergeant voight likes
everything just the way it is,

13:45.325 --> 13:48.493
So i wouldn't be
moving anything around.

13:48.495 --> 13:50.795
Well, i'm glad you told me.

13:50.796 --> 13:53.096
I was planning
on stealing the copier.

13:54.367 --> 13:55.533
I'm kidding.

14:01.508 --> 14:03.792
[chuckles]

14:03.793 --> 14:06.077
Awesome. After you, all i need
is ruzek to sign the card.

14:06.079 --> 14:07.178
Careful with ruzek.

14:07.180 --> 14:09.347
He's terrible
at keeping secrets.

14:09.349 --> 14:12.417
Okay, so i'm gonna steal her
car keys to pick up the cake,

14:12.419 --> 14:14.385
And if that doesn't work,
can i use yours?

14:14.387 --> 14:16.054
- Yep, no problem.
- Awesome.

14:16.056 --> 14:17.355
What's no problem?

14:17.357 --> 14:20.024
It's--it's all
under control.

14:22.929 --> 14:25.129
You better not be
planning me a surprise party.

14:25.131 --> 14:27.198
I'm not.

14:27.200 --> 14:30.101
I know where you live.

14:31.905 --> 14:33.538
So this is everything pertinent
from our files

14:33.540 --> 14:36.474
On the new york victims.

14:36.476 --> 14:37.942
Sergeant.

14:37.944 --> 14:40.078
Thanks for coming,
both of you.

14:40.080 --> 14:42.013
- Of course.
- Thank you.

14:42.015 --> 14:44.315
Hey, i guess that tip line
must have paid off.

14:44.317 --> 14:46.317
Apparently some woman
just called over in bucktown.

14:46.319 --> 14:48.519
She said that some guy
two weeks ago was asking

14:48.521 --> 14:50.188
For help unloading boxes
from his car.

14:50.190 --> 14:51.389
Was she attacked?

14:51.391 --> 14:53.358
No, she got a weird feeling
and took off.

14:53.360 --> 14:56.327
Get this, though,
the guy was wearing scrubs.

14:56.329 --> 14:58.162
Hey.
Here he is.

14:58.164 --> 14:59.297
What's up, baby?

14:59.299 --> 15:01.332
- Man, you all good?
- You know.

15:01.334 --> 15:02.567
You need anything,
just holler at me.

15:02.569 --> 15:04.903
Where's my hello?
Hey, what's up, man?

15:04.905 --> 15:06.404
What's up, man?
It's nice to see you.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.239
- Good to see you again.
- How are you?

15:08.241 --> 15:11.409
I'll go interview this woman.

15:11.411 --> 15:13.244
Know what,
maybe i'll come with.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.546
Hey, jay, you know,

15:15.548 --> 15:17.181
I'm still trying to get
some more information

15:17.183 --> 15:19.417
About this nurse
from chicago med who was killed.

15:19.419 --> 15:22.053
Her sister, unfortunately,
wasn't much help.

15:22.055 --> 15:24.055
Now, your brother's
a doctor there, am i right?

15:24.057 --> 15:25.189
Mm-hmm.

15:25.191 --> 15:26.324
Did he know her?

15:26.326 --> 15:28.059
He said he bumped into her
a few times.

15:28.061 --> 15:30.061
Okay, do you think
he'd be willing to come in

15:30.063 --> 15:31.396
And maybe point us

15:31.398 --> 15:33.264
In the direction of somebody
that knew her better?

15:33.266 --> 15:35.066
Uh, i doubt he knows much,

15:35.068 --> 15:36.935
But i can give him a call.

15:36.937 --> 15:38.136
That'd be really helpful.
Thanks.

15:38.138 --> 15:40.338
- Okay.
- Great.

15:51.651 --> 15:52.650
First floor, right?

15:52.652 --> 15:54.052
Yeah, first floor.

15:54.054 --> 15:56.120
[doorbell rings]

15:59.626 --> 16:01.192
Charlotte reegan?

16:01.194 --> 16:03.278
Yes.

16:03.279 --> 16:05.363
Hi, i'm detective dawson.
This is detective amaro.

16:05.365 --> 16:07.298
You called in
the tip line last night?

16:07.300 --> 16:09.434
Yeah.
Wow.

16:09.436 --> 16:10.468
You guys got here quick.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.470
Hey, charlotte...
Would you mind

16:12.472 --> 16:14.072
Taking us through
what happened?

16:14.074 --> 16:15.273
Of course.

16:15.275 --> 16:16.607
Come in.

16:18.378 --> 16:20.011
Oh, sorry about the mess.

16:20.013 --> 16:22.613
This place is so small,
my stuff gets everywhere.

16:22.615 --> 16:25.083
[sighs]
you know, when i was your age,

16:25.085 --> 16:27.352
I slept in a closet
in new york.

16:27.354 --> 16:30.421
- Yeah.
- 600 a month.

16:30.423 --> 16:32.457
So what happened
two weeks ago?

16:32.459 --> 16:36.060
Uh...It gets claustrophobic
in here.

16:36.062 --> 16:37.662
So i went for a walk.

16:37.664 --> 16:39.097
I was over by the park,

16:39.099 --> 16:42.200
And there was this guy
standing by his car.

16:42.202 --> 16:47.372
Said he needed help moving a box
to the passenger seat.

16:47.374 --> 16:50.074
He had a sling on his arm

16:50.076 --> 16:51.743
And doctor pants on
under a jacket.

16:51.745 --> 16:54.345
So i walked over to help,

16:54.347 --> 16:58.783
But when i got to the car, i saw
this, like, a carjack thingy

16:58.785 --> 17:00.718
In the backseat,

17:00.720 --> 17:03.254
And he was just
a little too, um,

17:03.256 --> 17:05.522
I don't know, uh,
too friendly.

17:05.525 --> 17:07.492
Too chatty.

17:07.493 --> 17:10.595
Did you get
a good look at him?

17:10.597 --> 17:12.262
Not really.

17:12.265 --> 17:13.464
It was night.

17:13.465 --> 17:14.732
He was a white guy.

17:14.733 --> 17:16.567
He was wearing a cap.

17:16.569 --> 17:18.136
Was there an emblem
on the cap?

17:18.137 --> 17:20.637
No, just a black ball cap.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.406
What kind of car
was he driving?

17:22.409 --> 17:24.242
Subaru. Wagon.

17:24.243 --> 17:26.477
I remember because my aunt
has one.

17:26.479 --> 17:28.445
Dark green.

17:28.448 --> 17:30.248
I didn't get the license plate
though.

17:30.250 --> 17:33.518
I just...Turned
and gripped my keys in my hand,

17:33.520 --> 17:37.155
And...Started walking.

17:37.157 --> 17:38.222
If you saw
this guy again,

17:38.224 --> 17:39.657
Would you be able
to identify him?

17:43.496 --> 17:45.463
Sergeant benson,
this is my brother will.

17:45.465 --> 17:47.065
If he insists on you
calling him dr. Halstead,

17:47.067 --> 17:49.067
You smack him
upside the head.

17:49.069 --> 17:50.134
Nice to meet you, sergeant.

17:50.136 --> 17:51.469
And don't listen to him.

17:51.471 --> 17:53.337
You've probably already
figured that out though.

17:53.339 --> 17:55.840
Okay, if you go by will,
then i'll go by olivia.

17:55.842 --> 17:58.476
I like you already. Hank.

17:58.478 --> 18:00.445
How you doing, will?

18:00.447 --> 18:01.512
He's got an hour
till his shift.

18:01.514 --> 18:02.814
I told him
we'd get him in and out.

18:02.816 --> 18:05.750
Of course. We just have
a couple of questions.

18:05.752 --> 18:09.554
- Why don't we go in here?
- All right.

18:11.691 --> 18:14.692
Hey, you mind if i join?

18:14.694 --> 18:16.227
Um...

18:16.229 --> 18:18.362
Yeah, sure.
Why not?

18:18.364 --> 18:20.198
- Okay. Here, have a seat.
- Oh, all right.

18:20.200 --> 18:21.632
- Thanks.
- Sure.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.502
I didn't know her well.

18:24.504 --> 18:28.372
Like i told jay, she was
just a really friendly person.

18:28.374 --> 18:31.476
Seemed to be well liked
by everyone on the staff,

18:31.478 --> 18:33.744
Although i would have to assume
there are other people

18:33.746 --> 18:35.746
At chicago med
who could give you more insight.

18:35.748 --> 18:38.483
Well, we were hoping that you
could do that for us, you know.

18:38.485 --> 18:40.485
We're just trying
to piece together

18:40.487 --> 18:43.321
Who she was as a person.

18:43.323 --> 18:45.490
Of course.
Whatever i can do.

18:45.492 --> 18:47.492
(benson)
did you know her
outside of work?

18:49.262 --> 18:51.762
No. I just
started a couple weeks ago,

18:51.764 --> 18:53.764
So i'm still in
the "getting to know you" stage,

18:53.766 --> 18:55.566
Meeting everyone.

18:55.567 --> 18:57.367
Been there.
That can take a while.

18:57.370 --> 19:02.373
So while you're here,

19:02.375 --> 19:05.243
Do you know this woman?

19:05.245 --> 19:07.245
Wow.

19:07.247 --> 19:10.348
Yeah, debra.

19:12.385 --> 19:14.285
It's been a while.

19:14.286 --> 19:16.186
She went missing a long time
ago back in new york.

19:16.189 --> 19:17.788
(benson)
yeah.

19:17.790 --> 19:20.658
How do you know debra, will?

19:23.663 --> 19:24.929
What's going on here?

19:29.569 --> 19:33.304
Well, we just found out
that will was in new york

19:33.306 --> 19:34.839
At the time
of the other two incidents.

19:34.841 --> 19:37.942
You just found out, my ass.

19:37.944 --> 19:40.878
Sarge,
she's ambushing my brother.

19:43.316 --> 19:45.850
You signed off on it.

19:45.852 --> 19:48.486
I'm a little confused here.

19:48.488 --> 19:49.854
Don't say another word.

19:49.856 --> 19:51.322
What--what are you
talking about?

19:51.324 --> 19:53.491
We're done.
Let's go.

19:56.496 --> 19:58.930
Are you asking
if i did these crimes?

19:58.932 --> 20:01.532
I am.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.384
I didn't.

20:03.385 --> 20:05.235
Don't say another word
until you get a lawyer.

20:05.238 --> 20:06.237
I don't need a lawyer.
I didn't do anything.

20:06.239 --> 20:07.572
It doesn't matter.

20:07.573 --> 20:08.906
If they want to, they'll find
a way to stitch you up.

20:08.908 --> 20:10.341
- Careful, jay.
- Come on!

20:10.343 --> 20:11.742
Back off!

20:14.981 --> 20:16.647
No, i saw what happened
to that girl,

20:16.649 --> 20:19.283
And if it were my sister
or my daughter or my mom,

20:19.285 --> 20:22.286
I'd want you to do exactly
what you're doing right now.

20:22.288 --> 20:24.655
Ask me anything you want
anytime.

20:24.657 --> 20:27.458
Appreciate that.

20:27.460 --> 20:29.560
If you could write down
where you were the night

20:29.562 --> 20:31.662
Of victoria's murder,
i would like a full statement.

20:31.664 --> 20:33.898
No, no, no, he's not writing
anything down. Come on, get up.

20:33.900 --> 20:35.933
- Jay.
- We're leaving now! Come on.

20:35.935 --> 20:38.903
[tense music]

20:38.905 --> 20:42.506
¶ ¶

20:42.508 --> 20:43.774
[sighs]

20:49.015 --> 20:51.482
[knock at door]
- yeah, come on in.

20:51.484 --> 20:53.384
Will's gonna write down
a statement, i'm gonna read it,

20:53.386 --> 20:54.652
And then i'll submit it to you.

20:54.654 --> 20:56.654
He was home
that night watching tv.

20:56.656 --> 20:58.156
Okay.

20:58.157 --> 20:59.657
- Can anyone put him there?
- No.

20:59.659 --> 21:00.958
He ordered a pay-per-view movie.

21:00.960 --> 21:02.376
I'm checking now to see
if i can get the records.

21:02.377 --> 21:03.793
You have any more questions
for my brother,

21:03.796 --> 21:05.263
You can go through me.

21:05.265 --> 21:08.266
Look, i understand
how you're feeling, jay,

21:08.268 --> 21:10.468
But you're not running point
on questioning your brother,

21:10.470 --> 21:12.270
And i think you understand why.

21:15.008 --> 21:17.541
I'll get you that report
after i've read it.

21:19.012 --> 21:21.246
[sighs]
okay.

21:21.247 --> 21:23.481
Tip lines in new york
are heating up as well.

21:23.483 --> 21:25.016
I need to get back there,

21:25.018 --> 21:26.784
See what new information
has popped up,

21:26.786 --> 21:28.919
If any, reinterview
some of the witnesses

21:28.921 --> 21:32.490
From the '04 cases.

21:32.492 --> 21:34.892
- About an hour and a half.
- Hmm.

21:34.894 --> 21:36.527
Look, i hope
i didn't put you in a bad spot.

21:36.529 --> 21:38.045
No, not at all.

21:38.046 --> 21:39.562
I would have done the same thing
with one of your guys.

21:39.565 --> 21:40.665
[sighs]

21:40.667 --> 21:42.833
Except i probably
wouldn't have asked.

21:42.835 --> 21:44.001
You'll let me know
if he checks out?

21:44.003 --> 21:45.069
Of course.

21:46.806 --> 21:48.072
Okay.

21:48.074 --> 21:49.507
Sure you got to go?

21:49.509 --> 21:50.741
[chuckles]

21:50.743 --> 21:54.612
You'll be in good hands
with fin and amaro.

21:54.614 --> 21:56.914
- Do me a favor.
- Hmm?

21:56.916 --> 22:00.384
Play this one
by the book, please?

22:00.386 --> 22:01.786
If this ever
goes to trial--

22:01.788 --> 22:05.523
I get it.
You have my word.

22:05.525 --> 22:07.591
You take care of yourself,
hank.

22:15.401 --> 22:18.002
So you ready?
You ready?

22:18.004 --> 22:20.805
All right, the witness said
that it was a dude

22:20.807 --> 22:23.541
In a dark-colored subaru wagon.

22:23.543 --> 22:26.043
Well, i was able
to access a security camera

22:26.045 --> 22:28.713
On a private residence
near the corner of the block

22:28.715 --> 22:30.581
Where victoria lewyn lives--

22:30.583 --> 22:32.683
Lived, rather.

22:32.685 --> 22:35.720
And check this out.

22:35.722 --> 22:36.921
Ah, there.

22:36.923 --> 22:39.056
Dark green subaru wagon.

22:39.058 --> 22:40.658
And that was an hour

22:40.660 --> 22:43.361
Before cfd responded
to the blaze in her apartment.

22:43.363 --> 22:44.862
- Now you're talking.
- Right?

22:44.864 --> 22:47.064
- You get the plates?
- No, i'm getting to that.

22:47.066 --> 22:50.401
We can only read
the first three digits.

22:50.403 --> 22:53.104
But there's only
one subaru wagon in that color

22:53.106 --> 22:54.805
With those three first numbers.

22:54.807 --> 22:58.843
Now, the car is registered
to elizabeth kendall.

22:58.845 --> 23:00.411
She's 78 years old.

23:00.413 --> 23:01.479
Okay, let's have the address.

23:01.481 --> 23:04.148
We can get a patrol out there.

23:06.085 --> 23:08.953
There it is.

23:08.955 --> 23:10.688
2113 squad.

23:10.690 --> 23:12.022
(dispatch)
go ahead, 2113.

23:12.024 --> 23:14.091
Can you roll an assist car,
no emergency,

23:14.093 --> 23:16.961
To the intersection
of throop and fillmore?

23:16.963 --> 23:18.562
Tell them
to throw an anchor down.

23:18.564 --> 23:21.399
We've located the vehicle
intelligence had the bolo on.

23:21.401 --> 23:22.967
- Copy that.
- Look at this.

23:22.969 --> 23:24.552
Be advised, squad,

23:24.553 --> 23:26.136
We have a male subject
approaching the vehicle.

23:26.139 --> 23:28.706
Hold us down on a stop
at this location.

23:28.708 --> 23:30.408
Will advise
if we need backup.

23:30.410 --> 23:31.409
(dispatch)
roger that.

23:31.411 --> 23:34.478
[siren wails]

23:48.961 --> 23:50.694
How's it going today, sir?

23:50.696 --> 23:52.196
Very well, thank you.

23:52.198 --> 23:54.899
Can i see your license
and registration?

23:54.901 --> 23:56.033
Is there a problem?

23:56.035 --> 23:59.437
No, you want there to be?

23:59.439 --> 24:02.573
(burgess)
can you pop your trunk, sir?

24:05.111 --> 24:07.211
(man)
uh, the car
is not in my name yet.

24:07.213 --> 24:08.679
I'm--i'm buying it
from a woman.

24:08.680 --> 24:10.146
We just haven't filed
the official paperwork.

24:10.149 --> 24:14.118
There is a note
attached from her stating that.

24:14.120 --> 24:15.686
New york.

24:15.688 --> 24:16.954
Yeah, just moved here
three months ago.

24:16.956 --> 24:19.557
Still waiting
on the illinois license.

24:19.559 --> 24:21.959
Can you take the key out of
the ignition and hand it to me?

24:24.130 --> 24:26.030
Officer, respectfully,

24:26.032 --> 24:28.666
I would like an explanation
as for why you're doing this.

24:28.668 --> 24:32.069
You're not entitled to one.
Now hand me the keys.

24:36.876 --> 24:38.876
Sit tight.

24:44.016 --> 24:45.249
Dude.

24:48.054 --> 24:50.955
We're bringing him in.

24:53.259 --> 24:54.658
He's clean.

24:54.660 --> 24:55.926
Nothing outstanding.

24:55.928 --> 24:57.828
No warrants, nothing.

24:57.830 --> 25:01.499
We're bringing him in.

25:01.501 --> 25:03.033
Okay.

25:10.910 --> 25:13.577
Mr. Yates, it looks like
your car was reported as being

25:13.579 --> 25:16.247
Involved in a hit-and-run
where a pedestrian was injured.

25:16.249 --> 25:18.082
Do you know anything about that?

25:18.084 --> 25:20.251
No, i don't.

25:20.253 --> 25:22.253
I've owned the car
for three weeks.

25:22.255 --> 25:24.221
Besides,
if you check the front bumper,

25:24.223 --> 25:26.590
Does it look like
anything's been hit?

25:26.592 --> 25:28.726
It's probably a false report,

25:28.728 --> 25:29.960
But you're still gonna need
to come in

25:29.962 --> 25:31.962
Until we clear this up, sir.

25:31.964 --> 25:34.632
So if you could
get out of the car.

25:34.634 --> 25:37.167
[sighs]

25:42.575 --> 25:45.743
Home address, employer
information, and what else?

25:45.745 --> 25:47.778
- Cell phone number.
- Oh, of course.

25:47.780 --> 25:50.180
So what brings you to chicago,
mr. Yates?

25:50.182 --> 25:51.582
Employment.

25:51.584 --> 25:53.851
- Where?
- Medhelp.

25:53.853 --> 25:56.654
It's an urgent care facility
on the south side.

25:56.656 --> 26:01.191
So you were a professor
at columbia in new york,

26:01.193 --> 26:04.862
Residency at presbyterian.

26:04.864 --> 26:05.863
That's correct.

26:05.865 --> 26:07.865
When was this?

26:07.867 --> 26:10.301
Well, i'm sure
that file states it.

26:10.303 --> 26:12.336
I'm asking you.

26:13.739 --> 26:16.140
[exhales]
ten years or so.

26:16.142 --> 26:17.908
Where have you been
since then?

26:17.910 --> 26:20.611
Oh, all over.

26:20.613 --> 26:22.846
Traveling.

26:22.848 --> 26:24.982
Lots of time
in new orleans.

26:24.984 --> 26:30.354
Now, oh,
there is a lawless town.

26:30.356 --> 26:33.357
My job as a physician, you know,
there's always a need.

26:33.359 --> 26:37.328
Always a spot to fill.

26:42.101 --> 26:44.635
How'd you go
from being a doctor

26:44.637 --> 26:46.236
At one of the best hospitals
in the country

26:46.238 --> 26:49.106
To working
at an urgent care?

26:49.108 --> 26:52.610
Man does not control
his own fate.

26:52.612 --> 26:56.146
The women in his life
do that for him.

26:57.717 --> 26:59.116
Groucho marx?
Oh.

26:59.118 --> 27:01.885
See, i bet
you don't even know who that is.

27:01.887 --> 27:03.821
You ever been to chicago med?

27:03.823 --> 27:05.322
Oh, sure.

27:07.093 --> 27:09.126
- As a patient or...
- [chuckles]

27:09.128 --> 27:13.330
No, actually,
i have lunch there sometimes.

27:14.634 --> 27:16.634
Recognize him?

27:17.970 --> 27:20.404
He wore a baseball cap,
and it was night.

27:20.406 --> 27:22.139
I mean, it could be him.

27:22.141 --> 27:26.410
I'm sorry.
I can't say for sure.

27:26.412 --> 27:29.413
Do you, uh--
you know this woman?

27:31.684 --> 27:34.818
No.

27:34.820 --> 27:36.286
Her?

27:38.791 --> 27:40.891
Her?

27:44.130 --> 27:46.997
Her, hmm?

27:46.999 --> 27:47.998
- No.
- No?

27:48.000 --> 27:50.167
No.

27:50.169 --> 27:54.271
No, are any of these
the pedestrian

27:54.273 --> 27:57.374
That the car i'm purchasing
supposedly struck?

27:57.376 --> 28:00.310
That is the reason
that i was brought in,

28:00.312 --> 28:03.313
Am i correct?

28:03.315 --> 28:05.082
You shave your arms, doctor?

28:11.824 --> 28:12.890
My whole body, actually.

28:12.892 --> 28:14.792
It's for cycling.

28:14.794 --> 28:18.128
Helps reduce drag.

28:18.130 --> 28:20.197
You know, i'm new to the city.

28:20.199 --> 28:22.332
What's the best spot
around here for cycling?

28:22.334 --> 28:24.201
I don't know.
My bike's still in storage.

28:24.203 --> 28:25.969
Am i under arrest?

28:28.841 --> 28:33.210
I do have a general sense
of my rights as a u.S. Citizen.

28:36.782 --> 28:38.282
You're free to go.

28:38.284 --> 28:41.285
[tense music]

28:41.287 --> 28:47.391
¶ ¶

28:47.393 --> 28:49.226
(lindsay)
thanks for coming in.

28:49.228 --> 28:51.862
Oh, i'm happy to help.

28:51.864 --> 28:55.899
Hmm, do you have
any travel plans, mr. Yates?

28:55.901 --> 28:56.934
None.

28:56.936 --> 28:58.268
Are you kidding?

28:58.270 --> 29:00.437
I just got
to your beautiful city.

29:00.439 --> 29:02.406
I can't wait to explore it.

29:02.408 --> 29:10.481
¶ ¶

29:16.288 --> 29:19.389
Hello.

29:19.391 --> 29:27.464
¶ ¶

29:32.204 --> 29:34.905
Get a state's attorney
on board asap.

29:34.907 --> 29:37.040
Give him the particulars,
probable cause,

29:37.042 --> 29:40.310
And let him know we believe
this guy is good for it.

29:40.312 --> 29:42.168
One of you figure out

29:42.169 --> 29:44.025
Who's gonna be
the affiant on his phone.

29:44.026 --> 29:45.882
- I'm on it, boss.
- We are gonna run this clean.

29:45.885 --> 29:47.451
We're gonna run it thorough.

29:47.453 --> 29:50.154
We're gonna run it by the book.

29:50.156 --> 29:52.823
Everybody understand?

29:52.825 --> 29:54.024
You got a sec?

29:54.026 --> 29:56.894
Go ahead.

29:56.896 --> 29:59.263
My brother ordered a pizza

29:59.265 --> 30:00.364
The night
victoria was assaulted.

30:00.366 --> 30:01.865
The delivery guy will vouch.

30:01.867 --> 30:03.867
Jay, he's been cleared
as a suspect.

30:03.869 --> 30:07.337
Wonderful. Moving on,
i told him about greg yates.

30:07.339 --> 30:09.156
Get this.

30:09.157 --> 30:10.974
They worked together for
a minute in the same hospital.

30:10.976 --> 30:13.043
Yates was one of his professors
in med school.

30:13.045 --> 30:14.411
He's got an opinion about him.

30:14.413 --> 30:16.180
- Al right, where's will now?
- He's downstairs.

30:16.182 --> 30:19.049
Go get him.

30:19.051 --> 30:20.117
Sir.

30:24.323 --> 30:25.589
He was one of those instructors

30:25.591 --> 30:27.991
That made the students
call him by his first name.

30:27.993 --> 30:30.127
Liked to hang out
at the bars we went to.

30:30.129 --> 30:33.030
Some bought into it,
but i always got a creepy vibe.

30:33.032 --> 30:35.432
Someone invited him out
to a party one night,

30:35.434 --> 30:37.201
And yates corners me,

30:37.203 --> 30:39.436
Starts talking
about who has the best ass,

30:39.438 --> 30:41.405
Who he'd like
to have sex with first.

30:41.407 --> 30:43.941
Debra mcculloch
was at that party,

30:43.943 --> 30:45.475
The nurse who went missing.

30:45.477 --> 30:47.411
Was it the night
she went missing?

30:47.413 --> 30:50.013
No, i think it was,
like, three nights before that,

30:50.015 --> 30:52.049
But they were both there.

30:52.051 --> 30:54.184
Could have easily met her
that night.

30:54.186 --> 30:56.386
(nadia)
lindsay, you have a call.

30:56.388 --> 30:58.388
It's greg yates.

31:08.133 --> 31:09.533
Detective lindsay.

31:09.535 --> 31:11.068
(yates)
i can't help but think

31:11.070 --> 31:13.337
That we got off
on the wrong foot.

31:13.339 --> 31:15.439
(lindsay)
how do you mean?

31:15.441 --> 31:17.040
Oh, i just feel like
i made a bad impression

31:17.042 --> 31:19.376
On your coworkers back there.

31:19.378 --> 31:21.311
I would--i would love to try
and win you guys back.

31:21.313 --> 31:24.948
Are you free to meet
for a short conversation?

31:24.950 --> 31:28.619
Sure, why don't you
come by the district?

31:28.621 --> 31:31.121
No, just you and me.

31:31.123 --> 31:32.923
The pavilion
at millennium park.

31:32.925 --> 31:34.258
Three hours.

31:34.260 --> 31:36.526
Thank you for your time
in advance.

31:40.299 --> 31:41.665
I'm meeting him.

31:47.072 --> 31:48.472
All right,
so voight will be able

31:48.473 --> 31:49.873
To communicate with you
through that.

31:49.874 --> 31:51.274
Now, i'd use your phone
in your other ear,

31:51.277 --> 31:53.010
Assuming you like
to hear over 4,000 hertz.

31:53.012 --> 31:54.511
- Okay, good?
- Yep.

31:54.513 --> 31:55.579
Just stay
where we can see you.

31:55.581 --> 31:57.514
I got it.

31:57.515 --> 31:59.448
We'll be nearby
in case anything goes sideways.

31:59.451 --> 32:01.151
Al, you guys
find a good lookout yet?

32:01.153 --> 32:03.620
We'll be near the pedestrian
bridge a few hundred yards away.

32:03.622 --> 32:06.523
Fin, amaro, you're on the ground
with ruzek and antonio.

32:06.525 --> 32:09.459
[phone rings]
- stay sharp.

32:11.196 --> 32:13.997
- Sergeant benson.
- Lindsay.

32:13.999 --> 32:17.401
Fin told me you're going
to meet with yates alone.

32:17.403 --> 32:19.536
(lindsay)
yeah.

32:19.538 --> 32:22.706
I figure he's either looking
to confess, he's playing us,

32:22.708 --> 32:24.441
Or he's looking
to do something stupid.

32:24.443 --> 32:27.177
And even if it's the last one,
he's been at this for ten years.

32:27.179 --> 32:29.980
It's--it's worth it if
we can finally bring him down.

32:29.982 --> 32:33.450
Look, just remember,
if he's reaching out to you,

32:33.452 --> 32:36.119
He's feeling the pressure,
all right?

32:36.121 --> 32:38.388
He could be capable
of anything right now.

32:38.390 --> 32:40.390
I'll be ready, sergeant.

32:41.560 --> 32:43.060
Be safe.

32:43.062 --> 32:45.028
Thanks, i will.

32:50.069 --> 32:53.203
[tense music]

32:53.205 --> 32:54.604
[sighs]

32:54.606 --> 33:02.746
¶ ¶

33:06.418 --> 33:08.719
Anybody got eyes on yates?

33:08.721 --> 33:10.687
(voight)
halstead, you got eyes on him?

33:15.627 --> 33:17.094
Nothing.

33:17.096 --> 33:18.395
Wait.

33:20.399 --> 33:21.598
(halstead)
i got him.

33:21.600 --> 33:23.533
He's approaching
from the west.

33:30.409 --> 33:33.410
Sorry i'm a little late.

33:33.412 --> 33:36.279
You look great,
by the way.

33:36.281 --> 33:39.216
So what was it you could only
tell me in the park at night?

33:39.218 --> 33:42.219
Want to go
grab a cup of coffee?

33:42.221 --> 33:43.653
It's too cold to sit.

33:45.624 --> 33:47.691
Come on.

33:49.094 --> 33:50.160
I'm harmless.

33:56.168 --> 33:58.368
(lindsay)
we can talk right here.

33:59.605 --> 34:02.072
No.

34:04.710 --> 34:06.410
I want some coffee.

34:08.614 --> 34:11.214
It's close, i promise.

34:14.219 --> 34:16.219
Or you can sit here

34:16.221 --> 34:20.389
And i'll see you
when i see you.

34:20.391 --> 34:28.465
¶ ¶

34:30.569 --> 34:33.203
(antonio)
yates and lindsay
are on the move.

34:42.246 --> 34:44.714
We're shifting positions.
We lost sight of lindsay.

34:48.152 --> 34:49.152
Yeah, i got them.

34:49.154 --> 34:50.253
They're headed
towards the walkway.

34:50.255 --> 34:51.588
We'll stay back.

34:54.226 --> 34:55.859
I do this walk at night.

34:55.860 --> 34:58.595
The skyline,
it's so beautiful.

34:58.597 --> 35:00.297
It stuns me every time.

35:00.299 --> 35:02.866
Hmm.

35:02.868 --> 35:04.367
Why'd you ask me
to meet you in the park

35:04.369 --> 35:06.236
If you wanted
to get coffee?

35:06.238 --> 35:08.105
Oh, it's nothing nefarious.

35:08.107 --> 35:09.706
I changed my mind.

35:09.708 --> 35:11.108
It's cold.

35:11.110 --> 35:12.676
You know what i think?

35:12.678 --> 35:16.279
I think it's a move to assert
control over the situation

35:16.281 --> 35:17.614
And over me.

35:17.616 --> 35:19.249
Your sergeant has gotten
in your head.

35:19.251 --> 35:20.750
Don't let him think for you.

35:20.752 --> 35:23.153
You're better than that.

35:23.155 --> 35:26.356
Have you been following
what's been going on in egypt,

35:26.358 --> 35:27.390
Post revolution?

35:27.392 --> 35:30.110
No.

35:30.111 --> 35:32.829
Well, they finally
got rid of mubarak in 2011.

35:32.831 --> 35:34.598
Do you remember this at all?

35:34.600 --> 35:36.867
There's much fanfare
and jubilation.

35:36.869 --> 35:40.370
The people are free.
The people have spoken.

35:40.372 --> 35:43.874
But when the euphoria ebbs,
as it inevitably does,

35:43.876 --> 35:45.876
What are they left with?

35:45.878 --> 35:49.713
High crime,
raided antiquities, unrest.

35:49.715 --> 35:53.517
See, you can unclench
the iron fist of that dictator,

35:53.519 --> 35:55.285
And that--
that's great,

35:55.287 --> 35:59.523
But you are not really prepared
for what's on the other side.

35:59.525 --> 36:02.392
You know what they call that,
detective?

36:02.394 --> 36:04.728
The law
of unintended consequences.

36:04.730 --> 36:06.964
Why did you want
to meet with me, greg?

36:06.965 --> 36:09.199
Well, you know what my favorite
example of that law is?

36:09.201 --> 36:12.202
In hanoi,
under french colonial rule,

36:12.204 --> 36:15.272
They established a bounty
for each rat tail turned in

36:15.274 --> 36:18.608
To try and reduce
the number of rats.

36:18.610 --> 36:20.710
You know what happened?

36:20.712 --> 36:24.548
People started breeding rats
for the tails,

36:24.550 --> 36:26.783
And that charming little country

36:26.785 --> 36:29.920
Ended up with more rats
than it started with.

36:29.922 --> 36:33.256
You want to know why i think
you wanted to meet me?

36:33.258 --> 36:37.327
Because i'm 5'5"
and i have brown hair,

36:37.329 --> 36:41.298
Exactly like all those women
that were murdered.

36:41.300 --> 36:43.533
Is that so?

36:43.535 --> 36:46.236
Why don't we talk about that
instead of hiding

36:46.238 --> 36:48.638
Behind all this
history 101 crap?

36:48.640 --> 36:50.974
Tell me what happened.

36:50.976 --> 36:54.311
I know that you want to.

36:56.548 --> 36:58.715
Who do i remind you of?

36:58.717 --> 37:01.685
Your mom?

37:01.687 --> 37:05.322
An ex-girlfriend maybe?

37:05.324 --> 37:06.623
Come on.

37:08.727 --> 37:11.394
More rats, detective.

37:14.533 --> 37:17.534
Remember that.

37:17.536 --> 37:25.609
¶ ¶

37:34.920 --> 37:37.554
(olinsky)
we've got him.
He's headed for the taxi.

37:44.830 --> 37:45.829
(voight)
you all right?

37:45.831 --> 37:48.431
Yeah, i'm fine.

37:48.433 --> 37:50.267
Patrol says he took the cab
to water tower place

37:50.269 --> 37:51.935
And then he slipped them
once he got inside.

37:51.937 --> 37:53.503
He's playing a game.

37:53.505 --> 37:54.938
He knows it's just
a matter of time.

37:54.940 --> 37:56.506
[phone rings]
- we'll get him.

37:56.508 --> 37:57.507
Voight.

37:57.509 --> 37:59.409
Sergeant.

37:59.411 --> 38:01.511
Chief wallace boden.

38:01.513 --> 38:04.581
[police radio chatter]

38:05.651 --> 38:07.917
We've got another body.

38:14.526 --> 38:17.427
[police radio chatter,
sirens wailing]

38:20.832 --> 38:22.932
- Hank.
- How you doing, chief?

38:22.934 --> 38:26.369
Sorry to see you again
like this.

38:26.371 --> 38:28.071
Detectives fin and amaro.

38:28.073 --> 38:30.407
- They're in from new york.
- Nice meeting you, chief.

38:30.409 --> 38:31.941
Chief boden, house 51.

38:31.943 --> 38:33.810
Pleasure.

38:33.812 --> 38:35.945
This way.

38:38.583 --> 38:42.018
Fire was started
in the bedroom.

38:42.020 --> 38:44.454
(fin)
you said "was started"?

38:44.456 --> 38:46.790
Yeah, the amount of damage
in the room,

38:46.792 --> 38:49.693
Lack of accidental causes,

38:49.695 --> 38:51.328
This is arson,
if you ask me.

38:51.330 --> 38:53.630
I just can't prove that
right now.

38:53.632 --> 38:57.500
Is there any way to tell whether
or not it was started remotely?

38:57.502 --> 38:59.369
We'll search
for an incendiary device,

38:59.371 --> 39:01.037
But even the device
survived the fire,

39:01.039 --> 39:02.972
It would be weeks, maybe months
before any conclusion,

39:02.974 --> 39:04.774
And that's if we are lucky.

39:04.776 --> 39:07.777
That's why he was with lindsay
when it started.

39:07.779 --> 39:10.347
Plausible deniability.

39:17.789 --> 39:20.423
What is she, 18?

39:23.862 --> 39:25.128
Mm.

39:25.130 --> 39:27.430
What's this?

39:31.670 --> 39:33.536
Green nail polish.

39:45.751 --> 39:47.784
- Was it him?
- Yeah.

39:47.786 --> 39:49.386
So he was using me
as an alibi?

39:49.388 --> 39:51.154
That's right.

39:51.156 --> 39:53.456
Yo, i got a location
on his phone.

39:53.458 --> 39:54.691
It's an apartment
on the west side.

39:54.693 --> 39:56.693
Get everyone over there now.

39:56.695 --> 39:58.962
- Give me the address.
- Yeah.

39:58.964 --> 40:00.997
Look, it's up to you, but--

40:00.999 --> 40:04.901
But if you're with me,
you better know what that means.

A lot of it.

Nothing.

40:51.917 --> 40:53.483
Clear.

40:59.024 --> 41:01.491
He was just here.
