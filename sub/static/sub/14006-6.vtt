00:01.490 --> 00:03.310
Previously on damages.

00:03.320 --> 00:08.330
Pulling the settlement now is
a move wherein tremendous risk...

00:08.570 --> 00:10.270
This is my legacy.

00:10.280 --> 00:12.040
I want my name back.

00:12.050 --> 00:13.350
I want redemption.

00:13.360 --> 00:16.340
I met a guy down in florida.

00:16.350 --> 00:18.580
Gregory turns out to
be our missing link.

00:18.590 --> 00:23.050
Gregory malina dumped his frobisher
stock the exact day arthur frobisher did.

00:23.060 --> 00:26.120
I burned her as a witness.It's done.

00:26.130 --> 00:27.600
Do you hear me?I'm done!

00:27.610 --> 00:30.100
Patty hewes will be
looking to depose you.

00:30.110 --> 00:31.190
How's it all been going?

00:31.200 --> 00:33.070
Great.We had our first fight.

00:33.080 --> 00:36.960
The last thing I want is for
my job to come between us.

00:37.250 --> 00:41.270
I heard you telling that other doctor
that you were gonna go see a movie?

00:41.540 --> 00:46.320
I want you to know that we are doing everything
that we can to make your grandfather comfortable.

00:46.330 --> 00:48.470
I know.Thanks.

00:48.480 --> 00:50.680
I'm not available.

00:50.990 --> 00:53.060
I...I'm engaged.

00:53.070 --> 00:56.460
We can...play this any way you'd like.

00:57.520 --> 00:59.870
There won't be room for him and patty.

00:59.880 --> 01:03.080
With patty hewes,there's only...patty.

01:05.000 --> 01:11.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

01:24.040 --> 01:26.380
I didn't kill,david.

01:27.350 --> 01:29.540
Someone tried to kill me.

01:29.550 --> 01:33.830
But,ellen,there was no
other body in your apartment.

01:34.680 --> 01:36.940
I wasn't in my apartment.

01:56.290 --> 01:58.600
Did you identify the body?

01:58.610 --> 01:59.850
There was no body.

01:59.860 --> 02:03.330
Well,that's impossible.

02:07.340 --> 02:09.850
There are things that I...

02:09.860 --> 02:12.210
I can't talk about.

02:12.220 --> 02:15.170
Why not?

02:16.170 --> 02:18.450
It's about the case.

02:18.850 --> 02:21.740
The frobisher case?

02:25.290 --> 02:28.060
3 1/2 MONTHS EARLIER

02:28.590 --> 02:30.020
Is this seat taken?

02:30.030 --> 02:31.600
No,no.Go ahead.

02:35.260 --> 02:37.280
What happened to your face?

02:38.020 --> 02:41.440
Consulting,you know.It's
a contact sport.

02:41.960 --> 02:44.350
My friend dated a consultant.

02:44.360 --> 02:46.060
Major heartbreak.

02:46.070 --> 02:47.400
Sorry to hear that.

02:47.410 --> 02:48.680
Yeah.

02:49.230 --> 02:52.600
He lied to her,pretended he was married.

02:53.160 --> 02:56.670
Made up some shit about
a guy in a limousine.

03:01.910 --> 03:04.070
I'm here alone,gregory.

03:04.080 --> 03:07.290
So,what,you're katie's
lawyer friend,right?

03:07.300 --> 03:09.110
She asked me to come talk to you guys.

03:09.120 --> 03:10.660
Why didn't you?

03:10.670 --> 03:12.860
'Cause I didn't know
anything about your case.

03:15.730 --> 03:18.270
How is katie?I liked her.

03:18.280 --> 03:22.330
Is that why you lied to her,humiliated
her and got her to perjure herself?

03:22.340 --> 03:24.290
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

03:26.950 --> 03:29.500
Katie thinks someone put you up to this.

03:29.510 --> 03:32.370
Given the shape your face
is in,maybe she's right.

03:33.310 --> 03:34.860
Who's pulling your strings,gregory?

03:34.870 --> 03:37.030
Nobody.Is patty hewes pulling yours?

03:37.040 --> 03:38.530
Patty doesn't know I'm here.

03:38.540 --> 03:39.520
Bullshit.

03:39.530 --> 03:43.070
If she did,you'd be holding a
subpoena or facing criminal charges.

03:43.530 --> 03:45.080
For what?

03:45.430 --> 03:48.770
Obstruction of justice,conspiracy
to cover up a felony.

03:49.230 --> 03:51.820
You know,if you're
lucky,that's ten years.

03:51.830 --> 03:53.840
You people are amazing.

03:54.920 --> 03:58.150
Just give me a name,gregory.I'll
keep you out of this.

03:58.480 --> 04:01.070
So when I give you a
name,you won't come after me?

04:01.080 --> 04:03.810
Not if you give us a bigger fish.

04:06.620 --> 04:08.130
Barney.

04:08.710 --> 04:10.410
What's his last name?

04:10.420 --> 04:13.800
Rubble.Lives in
bedrock.Hell of a right hook.

04:18.529 --> 04:20.060
You got 24 hours.

04:20.070 --> 04:21.589
Till what?

04:22.110 --> 04:24.570
Until patty hewes finds out about you.

04:24.580 --> 04:29.030
And once that happens,we subpoena
you,and we do it the hard way.

05:17.940 --> 05:19.890
Do you think gregory believed you?

05:20.710 --> 05:22.610
I don't know.He's kind of a mess.

05:22.620 --> 05:24.150
You mentioned katie.

05:24.160 --> 05:26.710
Yeah.But he's pretty hard to read.

05:26.950 --> 05:30.850
He kept acting like he was being watched,and
he may have reason to be paranoid.

05:30.860 --> 05:32.610
What makes you say that?

05:32.620 --> 05:36.150
He had a bruise on his face.Looked
like he'd been in a fight.

05:36.160 --> 05:37.310
Really?

05:38.400 --> 05:41.410
I don't understand why we
haven't just subpoenaed him.

05:42.130 --> 05:44.130
Well,it would be better
if he came in willingly.

05:44.140 --> 05:46.390
If we subpoena him,he could clam up.

05:46.400 --> 05:48.590
Do you think he'll talk to us?

05:48.600 --> 05:53.210
I think he's scared,and I think he may
feel guilty about what he did to katie.

05:53.850 --> 05:55.970
What about you?

05:56.430 --> 05:57.970
What do you mean?

05:59.060 --> 06:01.050
This was a big step.

06:01.060 --> 06:03.100
Approaching a witness...

06:03.110 --> 06:05.490
under false pretenses...

06:05.500 --> 06:08.280
offering protection you can't provide.

06:08.290 --> 06:11.020
Don't they teach that in law school?

06:13.200 --> 06:15.240
So now what?

06:15.560 --> 06:19.200
You don't hear from gregory
in 24 hours,we subpoena him.

06:19.460 --> 06:21.640
And in the meantime?

06:22.020 --> 06:25.920
Dinner,8:00 tomorrow night,my apartment.

06:27.180 --> 06:29.300
Don't be late.

06:29.310 --> 06:32.150
So let her subpoena you.You
knew this might happen.

06:32.160 --> 06:33.980
All you've got to do is tell the truth.

06:33.990 --> 06:36.570
Just leave out a few details.

06:37.060 --> 06:39.750
Here.What were you doing in florida?

06:39.760 --> 06:40.760
Vacationing.

06:40.770 --> 06:42.840
Why was the apartment in your name?

06:42.850 --> 06:44.330
I rented it with some friends.

06:44.340 --> 06:45.820
What about your job?

06:45.830 --> 06:49.230
Applied for a training program,discovered
i had a knack for consulting.

06:49.240 --> 06:50.950
So what's the problem?

06:52.700 --> 06:54.530
Something you want to say?

06:54.690 --> 06:56.520
I want to talk to him.

06:56.530 --> 06:59.050
He doesn't talk to
you.You know how it works.

06:59.060 --> 07:01.040
Look,he's the whole reason
I got pulled into this thing.

07:01.050 --> 07:04.470
I'm tired of protecting him.I
just want to talk to him.

07:06.080 --> 07:08.020
Hold this a second.

07:09.590 --> 07:11.960
My advice to you?

07:12.730 --> 07:15.940
Anytime you get the urge
to think for yourself?

07:16.840 --> 07:17.660
Resist it.

07:17.670 --> 07:19.100
I told you...

07:19.110 --> 07:21.130
I want my life back.

07:21.140 --> 07:22.590
This is your life.

07:22.600 --> 07:25.140
Throw that away for me,will ya?

07:29.350 --> 07:30.190
You want one of these?

07:30.200 --> 07:33.270
No,I'm good with my espresso,thanks.

07:36.400 --> 07:39.330
You look a little sleepy
there,partner.Everything all right?

07:39.810 --> 07:45.310
It's just a touch of insomnia and
pesky dreams-- nothing too worrisome.

07:46.250 --> 07:48.810
I got just the person for you,ray.

07:48.820 --> 07:53.020
I couldn't get a good night's sleep
through that whole government trial.

07:53.030 --> 07:55.480
This therapist did wonders for me.

07:55.490 --> 07:56.810
Doesn't matter
what you have--

07:56.820 --> 08:02.690
either bruxism,you know,hypnic
jerks,exploding head syndrome-- she's terrific.

08:03.240 --> 08:05.090
Trust me,seriously.

08:07.990 --> 08:09.420
So...

08:09.430 --> 08:11.860
at your son's basketball game...

08:11.870 --> 08:13.120
Last night.

08:13.130 --> 08:15.360
I'm sitting up in the stands with holly.

08:15.660 --> 08:20.380
Other parents are up there,you know,and
this woman about two rows behind me...

08:20.390 --> 08:22.210
she spits on me.

08:23.760 --> 08:25.610
Back of my head.

08:25.620 --> 08:27.800
And you'd like me to...

08:27.810 --> 08:28.720
what?

08:28.730 --> 08:33.360
All this woman knows about me is what she
reads in the newspaper or sees on television,

08:33.370 --> 08:37.120
and she hates me so much
that she can to spit on me?

08:38.960 --> 08:42.230
Look,I'm not exactly
a young man anymore.

08:42.500 --> 08:44.270
Worried about your legacy.

08:44.280 --> 08:46.900
Yeah,I'm not a monster,ray.

08:46.910 --> 08:49.310
I don't want to be remembered as one.

08:49.320 --> 08:51.140
So what are you proposing?

08:53.140 --> 08:55.320
a memoir.You know?

08:56.700 --> 09:02.280
Show these people the real me,the family
me,you know,the-the husband,the father.You know.

09:02.780 --> 09:04.940
Maybe,uh...I don't know.

09:04.950 --> 09:08.140
Show 'em a picture of my childhood home.

09:08.150 --> 09:10.100
You know,I grew up poor.

09:10.110 --> 09:12.930
Maybe a chapter on my dyslexia.

09:13.620 --> 09:16.500
You know,that's
actually a terrific idea.

09:16.940 --> 09:20.260
We'll set you up with a
publisher right after the trial.

09:20.270 --> 09:22.370
No.No,no,no.Now.

09:22.380 --> 09:23.510
Art,no,no,no.

09:23.520 --> 09:25.590
You do this now,

09:25.600 --> 09:30.260
people could perceive it as a sign
of desperation-- or worse,guilt.

09:30.270 --> 09:32.640
Not if we do it right.Just
get me a ghostwriter,

09:32.650 --> 09:34.950
somebody who has a lot of
experience in this sort of thing.

09:34.960 --> 09:38.200
You're gonna allow some complete
stranger to poke into your life?

09:38.210 --> 09:40.760
No,ray...he'll be working for me.

09:40.770 --> 09:42.910
He'll be working for the publisher.

09:42.920 --> 09:46.430
You'll never be able to
control the flow of information.

09:46.440 --> 09:49.670
First thing you know,they'll be down
in your basement digging for bodies.

09:49.680 --> 09:51.130
Hey,you know something?

09:51.140 --> 09:53.260
Set this up for me.

09:53.590 --> 09:56.040
- Get me a writer,and stop being an asshole.
- Art...

09:56.050 --> 09:58.040
You're being an asshole.She spat at me!

09:58.050 --> 10:00.350
You know something?She spat at me.

10:01.490 --> 10:03.590
In front of my kids.

10:06.450 --> 10:08.760
The book's a good idea.

10:11.470 --> 10:13.670
I can't wait to read it.

10:18.820 --> 10:20.500
Ellen?

10:22.280 --> 10:24.110
You still awake?

10:25.390 --> 10:29.410
Demonstrators say if the three buildings
behind them and one other come down this week,

10:29.420 --> 10:33.120
it could be a very long time before
anything goes up in their place

10:33.130 --> 10:36.070
because there are a number of lawsuits
against the atlantic yards project

10:36.080 --> 10:39.470
that could take months
or even years to decide.

10:39.480 --> 10:42.820
Daniel goldstein heads the group
develop don't destroy brooklyn.

10:42.830 --> 10:45.930
He is one of 13 homeowners
in federal court challenging

10:45.940 --> 10:49.170
the developers' use of eminent
domain to take away their homes

10:49.180 --> 10:52.490
where forest city ratner plans
to build an arena for the nets...

10:52.500 --> 10:56.240
Oh,I had the tv on.I must have left
this morning without turning it off.

10:56.250 --> 10:58.670
Well,I'm just glad that you're okay.

10:58.680 --> 11:01.580
Oh,hey,listen i forgot to tell you.

11:01.590 --> 11:05.460
Tomorrow night,patty asked
us to dinner at her place.

11:05.960 --> 11:07.560
You forgot?

11:07.570 --> 11:09.270
I know,I screwed up.

11:09.280 --> 11:11.250
It's our one night together.

11:11.260 --> 11:13.630
We were going to try
that new mexican place.

11:13.640 --> 11:15.840
I know,I'm sorry,babe.

11:15.850 --> 11:19.020
Well,who's gonna be there?

11:19.410 --> 11:22.040
I think it's just her and her husband.

11:22.050 --> 11:24.680
And us?Jesus,ellen...

11:24.690 --> 11:27.930
I know,maybe it'll be fun.They
have this great apartment.

11:27.940 --> 11:29.350
Ellen,after everything
that happened with katie,

11:29.360 --> 11:32.780
why would I possibly want to
socialize with patty hewes?

11:32.790 --> 11:34.140
She's my boss.

11:34.150 --> 11:37.310
She wants to meet you.What
am I supposed to say?

11:41.170 --> 11:42.970
I don't want to go.

11:42.980 --> 11:45.710
David,can you please do this for me?

11:50.460 --> 11:51.470
Fine.

11:55.010 --> 11:57.740
I'll be a couple more hours.

12:06.110 --> 12:08.350
Lila.Hey.

12:08.360 --> 12:10.540
The nurse at your station
said you'd be here.

12:11.540 --> 12:14.640
Well...is everything okay?

12:17.060 --> 12:20.060
I know when you guys discharged my
grandfather from the hospital last week,

12:20.070 --> 12:21.840
he was doing really great.

12:22.290 --> 12:25.360
But,uh,saturday night
things took a turn.

12:26.200 --> 12:28.630
Did you call the paramedics?

12:28.640 --> 12:30.080
Yeah.

12:30.370 --> 12:32.890
He was dead by the time they got there.

12:34.650 --> 12:36.510
Oh,my god.

12:37.310 --> 12:39.360
I-I'm so sorry.I...

12:39.370 --> 12:42.420
I've been so busy that
i didn't even hear.

12:42.790 --> 12:45.130
Is there anything that I can do?

12:45.140 --> 12:46.890
Actually...

12:47.450 --> 12:49.010
I hate to ask.

12:49.020 --> 12:50.360
What?

12:50.950 --> 12:54.580
There's all this medical equipment
in our apartment-- his machines.

12:54.590 --> 12:56.660
The nurse said that I could
sell them on craig's list,

12:56.670 --> 12:59.310
but I just don't know
what they're worth.

12:59.320 --> 13:01.340
Do you know what kind
of machines they are?

13:01.350 --> 13:04.340
I'm not sure.I'd need
someone to tell me.

13:05.660 --> 13:08.170
Do you think maybe
you could take a look?

13:10.690 --> 13:11.340
Lila...

13:11.350 --> 13:13.850
Look,I know I acted
inappropriately before.

13:13.860 --> 13:17.040
You're engaged.I respect that.

13:19.760 --> 13:22.400
I could just really
use your help right now.

13:29.190 --> 13:31.890
Well...where do you live?

13:37.260 --> 13:38.970
David conner's phone records.

13:38.980 --> 13:40.350
And?

13:40.680 --> 13:43.560
Someone called him a half dozen
times the night before he was killed.

13:43.570 --> 13:44.810
Who?

13:46.000 --> 13:48.780
Her name is lila dimeo.

13:56.690 --> 13:58.190
What's the occasion?

13:58.200 --> 14:01.440
The occasion,ray,is gratitude.

14:01.450 --> 14:02.640
Thank you.

14:02.650 --> 14:06.850
No,ray,thank you.16 years of service.

14:06.860 --> 14:12.460
Government trial-- head to head in a ring
with patty hewes and we're still standing.

14:12.810 --> 14:15.110
Miracles do happen.

14:15.120 --> 14:16.750
You're a good friend,ray.

14:16.760 --> 14:18.640
Thank you.

14:20.220 --> 14:22.690
means a lot to hear you say that.

14:23.830 --> 14:25.490
Bottoms up.

14:29.760 --> 14:33.090
What's the matter?What is it?

14:35.180 --> 14:37.910
Oh,goddamn it,man,what...

14:58.040 --> 15:00.920
Mr.Fiske,it's time to leave
for the frobisher meeting.

15:01.440 --> 15:03.770
Thank you,kitty.

15:11.710 --> 15:14.030
You talk to the sleep
therapist yet,buddy?

15:14.040 --> 15:16.870
No,no,I haven't had the time.

15:17.660 --> 15:19.940
Ray,you got dark circles
under your eyes,man.

15:19.950 --> 15:22.300
You're walking like a corpse.

15:22.610 --> 15:24.840
You should call her.

15:26.310 --> 15:27.620
Hey,owen.

15:27.630 --> 15:29.070
What's up,dad?

15:30.540 --> 15:32.810
So,have you heard from
the publisher or not?

15:32.820 --> 15:35.080
They chose your writer.

15:35.090 --> 15:36.110
Fella from yale.

15:36.120 --> 15:41.170
Writes fiction no one reads,but
he's one hell of a biographer.

15:42.170 --> 15:43.500
Fantastic.

15:43.510 --> 15:45.350
Yeah,it is.

15:45.360 --> 15:47.600
Look,I want you to know,

15:47.610 --> 15:52.090
the publisher intends to have you
talk about your current litigation.

15:54.110 --> 15:58.610
It won't be the sole focus of the
book-- you can still get your story out--

15:58.620 --> 16:03.680
but they're insisting that candid
insight into your company's collapse

16:03.690 --> 16:08.760
and your perspective on the ensuing
trials will be a major selling point.

16:09.180 --> 16:12.690
Now,obviously,you can still back out.

16:13.360 --> 16:15.700
Frankly,that would be my advice.

16:19.030 --> 16:20.590
No.

16:20.880 --> 16:22.880
I want to do this.

16:25.510 --> 16:27.450
I have to do this.

16:27.460 --> 16:30.010
Tread lightly,art.

16:33.430 --> 16:36.670
People need to know who I am,ray.

16:37.960 --> 16:40.190
Don't be afraid to put
your nose right in there.

16:41.290 --> 16:43.460
Inhale that.It's an incredible vintage.

16:43.470 --> 16:47.370
This is a 2001 cabernet merlot blend.

16:47.810 --> 16:50.210
Intense concentration.

16:52.290 --> 16:54.030
What do you think?

16:54.810 --> 16:59.760
Uh,yes.It's got a
fantastic concentration.

17:00.550 --> 17:03.780
Really,it'S...incredible.

17:05.589 --> 17:08.020
Do you like wine,david?

17:08.030 --> 17:10.390
Wine?Sure.

17:11.750 --> 17:15.950
Oh,come on,david,we had pinot
grigio the other night.What was that?

17:18.050 --> 17:19.819
I don't remember.

17:20.349 --> 17:22.180
Phil knows everything about wine.

17:22.190 --> 17:25.109
I only know two things Red and white.

17:32.120 --> 17:36.340
Your sister must know a lot about
wine,what with a restaurant and all.

17:40.080 --> 17:42.620
Yeah,she does.

17:43.370 --> 17:45.460
How is katie?

17:46.420 --> 17:47.660
Not good.

17:47.940 --> 17:49.770
Oh,I'm sorry to hear that.

17:49.780 --> 17:51.540
Please send her my best.

17:52.820 --> 17:54.780
don't beg.

17:56.280 --> 17:59.280
So how did you guys meet?

18:00.440 --> 18:02.900
You tell,phil.I always get it wrong.

18:02.910 --> 18:05.670
Not a romantic bone
in this woman's body.

18:05.990 --> 18:08.450
It was '94.I was working for
the indonesian government.

18:08.460 --> 18:11.300
I was in jakarta.I was
restructuring the national bank.

18:11.310 --> 18:13.660
She was walking through
the hotel lobby...

18:13.670 --> 18:16.060
I'm terribly sorry.Excuse me.

18:17.200 --> 18:20.240
It's dubai.The market
is just opening there.

18:20.250 --> 18:22.600
I'm sorry.Excuse me,please.

18:22.610 --> 18:24.970
Bob?Yes.

18:32.500 --> 18:34.550
So how did you two meet?

18:35.430 --> 18:39.290
Berger?Berber,it's with a B.

18:39.300 --> 18:40.700
George is fine.

18:42.030 --> 18:45.130
So,george,I hear you're a smart guy.

18:45.140 --> 18:47.520
I understand you're writing a novel.

18:47.530 --> 18:50.070
Yeah,that's right.

18:50.840 --> 18:52.770
That's very impressive.

18:53.150 --> 18:54.600
Thank you.

18:54.610 --> 18:55.920
So how does this work?

18:55.930 --> 18:57.970
Should I just start telling
stories about myself?

18:57.980 --> 19:00.180
Or do you want to ask me questions?

19:00.190 --> 19:02.140
It's up to us.

19:02.640 --> 19:08.090
Although I do have a couple things to get
started,just to understand some basics.

19:08.100 --> 19:09.330
Yeah,shoot.

19:09.580 --> 19:10.800
Okay?

19:14.650 --> 19:20.710
So when the accounting irregularities
in your company were first discovered...

19:21.880 --> 19:25.410
and this is just because I don't
have a degree in economics...

19:25.830 --> 19:30.990
Yeah,listen,george,we're
going to get to it.

19:31.310 --> 19:33.950
I have a lot I want to say about that.

19:33.960 --> 19:35.510
Trust me.

19:36.940 --> 19:41.920
But why don't I just tell
you things about who I am?

19:42.290 --> 19:45.030
You know,like my childhood.

19:45.040 --> 19:46.440
Absolutely.

19:46.450 --> 19:48.370
Okay,great,great.

19:50.800 --> 19:54.760
Um,well,are you familiar with dyslexia?

19:55.710 --> 19:59.300
Glass of port?I have a ferreira
lagrima that will make you weep.

19:59.310 --> 20:02.280
Oh,thank you,but i think that
we've got to get going,so...

20:02.290 --> 20:05.830
No,we can stay for a glass.I've
always wanted to try port.

20:06.370 --> 20:10.040
Ellen,come into the kitchen
with me.We can choose a dessert.

20:10.050 --> 20:11.370
Sure.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.590
You like cigars?

20:21.370 --> 20:22.930
Like some coffee?

20:22.940 --> 20:23.890
Sure.Thanks.

20:23.900 --> 20:25.290
There you are.

20:26.180 --> 20:28.570
- Sugar?
- Thank you.

20:28.580 --> 20:30.520
Thank you so much for
having us to dinner.

20:30.530 --> 20:32.170
Our pleasure.

20:32.180 --> 20:35.900
I always like to get to know my new
associates and their significant others.

20:35.910 --> 20:38.420
Well,we really
appreciate the invitation.

20:38.430 --> 20:42.200
It's our pleasure.Fun for us.

20:44.210 --> 20:48.420
I'm really sorry about david.I
think he's still upset about katie.

20:48.630 --> 20:49.900
He's lovely.

20:49.910 --> 20:52.130
But he's started his surgical rotation.

20:52.140 --> 20:54.320
He's doing these endless
shifts.He's very sleep-deprived.

20:55.440 --> 20:58.590
I really understand,but I
don't think it's just that.

20:59.310 --> 21:00.990
What do you mean?

21:02.250 --> 21:04.170
Let's be honest Men are sensitive.

21:04.180 --> 21:06.990
They don't like to be dragged anywhere.

21:07.000 --> 21:11.150
We may not like it,but we
know how to play second fiddle.

21:11.160 --> 21:13.060
We're bred for it.

21:13.340 --> 21:15.910
Men can't do it.

21:16.190 --> 21:20.320
At least,not the ones
worth sharing a bed with.

21:20.870 --> 21:24.090
Ellen,we got to go.I got work.

21:25.220 --> 21:26.960
Biscotti?

21:27.340 --> 21:29.500
And then she's got to bring up katie?

21:29.510 --> 21:31.420
Because patty's concerned about her.

21:31.430 --> 21:32.920
Bullshit.

21:32.930 --> 21:36.530
David,you were acting like you didn't want
to be there long before patty mentioned katie.

21:36.540 --> 21:37.870
Because I didn'T.

21:37.880 --> 21:39.690
Yeah,you made that perfectly clear.

21:39.700 --> 21:45.360
I'm so sorry if I'm not interested
in international arbitrage.

21:45.370 --> 21:47.240
Phil was just trying
to make conversation.

21:47.250 --> 21:48.910
And when patty asked
you about the hospital...

21:48.920 --> 21:50.240
I answered her question.

21:50.250 --> 21:52.950
No,you grunted like a caveman.

21:53.250 --> 21:55.380
I answered her,didn't I?

21:55.390 --> 21:57.270
I had to apologize for you.

21:57.280 --> 21:59.180
You what?

22:05.070 --> 22:07.350
You can't do this to me,david.

22:07.910 --> 22:09.740
Patty knew you were miserable.

22:10.920 --> 22:13.430
These events are part my
job.There are going to be more.

22:13.440 --> 22:15.430
I get it.Patty's your boss.

22:15.440 --> 22:18.490
That doesn't mean that
I have to like her.

22:23.960 --> 22:25.510
Hello?

22:28.350 --> 22:31.430
Hello.Who is this?

22:31.440 --> 22:33.060
It's gregory malina.

22:34.620 --> 22:36.440
Want to talk.

22:43.960 --> 22:46.180
Wouldn't y Where did
you meet david connor?

22:47.440 --> 22:48.770
At the hospital.

22:48.780 --> 22:50.420
Where he worked?

22:50.430 --> 22:53.130
David treated my grandfather.

22:53.390 --> 22:54.970
I'm sorry.I just can't believe this.

22:54.980 --> 22:57.230
Miss dimeo,how long were you dating***?

22:57.240 --> 22:59.160
Almost four months.

23:01.320 --> 23:02.680
What?

23:03.040 --> 23:06.740
Any idea why ellen parsons didn't
move out until two days ago?

23:07.050 --> 23:09.230
She moved out the day
she found out about us.

23:09.240 --> 23:12.500
So he was cheating on
miss parsons with you?

23:13.670 --> 23:16.150
3 1/2 MONTHS EARLIER

23:18.200 --> 23:19.250
Can I take your jacket?

23:19.260 --> 23:21.470
Yeah,thank you.

23:22.570 --> 23:23.750
Thanks.

23:25.160 --> 23:26.870
Caught up there.

23:27.320 --> 23:28.450
Sorry.

23:32.940 --> 23:35.250
Oh,that's me and my parents.

23:35.260 --> 23:37.340
They passed away when I was a kid.

23:38.420 --> 23:40.790
Your grandfather raised you?

23:42.520 --> 23:44.650
Uh,machine's in here.

23:55.710 --> 23:57.850
Oh,it's a defibrillator.

23:59.480 --> 24:00.720
Uh,you know,

24:00.730 --> 24:05.940
on tv in hospitals when they put the
paddles on people's chest and yell,clear?

24:07.100 --> 24:08.320
Oh,right.

24:08.330 --> 24:10.620
That's what that is.

24:12.370 --> 24:17.380
Um,did my grandfather ever tell you
that he was a medic in world war ii?

24:17.390 --> 24:18.780
No.

24:19.200 --> 24:21.130
Did he go to med school?

24:21.140 --> 24:22.380
He was a butcher.

24:22.390 --> 24:24.780
I guess that qualified him.

24:25.090 --> 24:26.940
check it out.

24:29.590 --> 24:31.160
Is that a bullet?

24:31.170 --> 24:34.350
From iwo jima.Made a
movie about it,actually.

24:34.360 --> 24:37.310
My,uh,grandfather got shot in the leg,

24:37.650 --> 24:40.960
and he got this as a reminder.

24:41.310 --> 24:43.000
Of what?

24:44.690 --> 24:48.560
Well,life is short.He had it inscribed.

24:49.530 --> 24:51.740
Words to live by.

25:00.030 --> 25:01.610
- I need to go.
- Okay.

25:01.620 --> 25:05.190
But,um,the defibrillator,it's used.

25:05.200 --> 25:07.370
So you'll probably get
400 or 500 bucks for it.

25:07.380 --> 25:13.620
But,um,just make sure that you
list it as aed m series,okay?

25:17.160 --> 25:19.770
Um,I'll get your jacket.

25:27.170 --> 25:28.780
I hate that bitch.

25:29.430 --> 25:31.530
Stare at her every day at work.

25:31.540 --> 25:35.600
Stands there holding her
torch,lcoming everybody.It's bullshit.

25:36.400 --> 25:38.160
She don't look after anybody.

25:38.720 --> 25:42.350
No,she doesn'T.You got
to look out for yourself.

25:43.520 --> 25:48.280
When I first moved here,I thought I'd
just,you know,figure out what I was good at.

25:49.290 --> 25:50.630
And?

25:50.640 --> 25:53.600
Turns out the only talent I have
is getting people to like me.

25:55.050 --> 25:57.110
This is crazy.

25:57.570 --> 26:00.700
This all comes down to getting
attention of someone at a bar.

26:01.450 --> 26:02.850
I'm glad you called.

26:02.860 --> 26:05.030
Yeah,you're glad i called.

26:05.040 --> 26:07.340
- What?
- What,are we friends now?

26:07.950 --> 26:12.100
Look,I'm only here because I'm sick of
these assholes,and i want it to stop.

26:12.340 --> 26:15.630
Tell me who ordered you to
set up katie and maybe it will.

26:17.740 --> 26:19.140
Who was it,gregory?

26:19.150 --> 26:21.920
Do you understand the risk I'm
taking talking to you right now?

26:21.930 --> 26:23.400
I can protect you.

26:23.410 --> 26:26.310
Like you protected
katie?Give me a break.

26:31.050 --> 26:32.960
This isn't safe.I shouldn't be here.

26:32.970 --> 26:33.880
Wait.

26:33.890 --> 26:37.590
Gregory,just give me a name,okay?Was
frobisher's broker in the car?

26:37.600 --> 26:39.660
Forget about him.It's
not about the broker.

26:39.670 --> 26:40.760
What do you mean?

26:40.770 --> 26:42.790
It's more...

26:48.690 --> 26:50.430
Gregory!

26:51.460 --> 26:52.660
Shit.

27:12.050 --> 27:14.550
If this is bad news,I
don't want to hear it.

27:14.560 --> 27:16.490
They're talking to the kid.

27:16.870 --> 27:19.030
It was only a matter of time.

27:19.700 --> 27:21.400
He has been prepped,hasn't he?

27:21.410 --> 27:22.580
Of course.

27:22.590 --> 27:24.160
So what's the problem?

27:24.170 --> 27:26.210
The problem is gregory's conscience.

27:26.220 --> 27:27.610
You...

27:28.330 --> 27:29.960
I don't want to hear
this shit right now.

27:29.970 --> 27:31.300
We need a new strategy,arthur.

27:31.310 --> 27:32.980
So find one.

27:32.990 --> 27:34.720
You guys said that you
were going to handle this.

27:34.730 --> 27:36.600
Look,this wasn't my mess.It was his.

27:36.610 --> 27:39.530
I don't care whose mess it
is.Just deal with it.Jesus.

27:39.540 --> 27:44.550
You know,next time you call
me,make sure it's for good news.****

27:51.280 --> 27:52.150
Gregory said what?

27:52.160 --> 27:54.790
He said,forget about the broker.

27:55.680 --> 27:56.790
What does that mean?

27:56.800 --> 28:00.760
I don't know.I think he wanted
to say more,but he seemed spooked.

28:01.840 --> 28:03.690
We have to bring him in.

28:03.700 --> 28:05.990
Tom,draft the subpoena.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.730
You got it.

28:10.410 --> 28:12.480
What,ellen?

28:12.490 --> 28:15.070
We know what frobisher
did to katie's dog.

28:15.080 --> 28:16.780
Yes.

28:17.210 --> 28:20.550
So is there anything we
can do to protect gregory?

28:29.090 --> 28:30.750
Want a game of horse?

28:31.290 --> 28:32.020
All right.

28:32.030 --> 28:33.490
You first.

28:34.900 --> 28:37.820
I talked about you all
yesterday afternoon.

28:41.320 --> 28:43.310
I'm writing a book,you know?

28:43.850 --> 28:45.980
Yeah,mom told me.

28:46.340 --> 28:48.560
I used to be able to dunk this sucker.

28:48.570 --> 28:50.110
Yeah,you always say that.

28:51.680 --> 28:57.370
Yeah,I told him the story about
our camping trip.You remember that?

28:58.000 --> 29:02.040
You got all scared 'cause you thought
the jabberwocky was hiding behind a tree,

29:02.050 --> 29:06.940
but you got all mixed up and you started
screaming,liberace's behind a tree!

29:07.970 --> 29:09.410
I was six.

29:10.240 --> 29:11.710
Yeah,you were.

29:13.460 --> 29:19.320
Hey,look,I know being my son these
days,you're catching a lot of grief.

29:20.620 --> 29:22.620
I don't listen to that crap.

29:22.630 --> 29:24.950
That shit they're saying about me,

29:25.280 --> 29:29.470
someday,soon,they're going to eat that.

29:30.260 --> 29:34.620
Then we'll just be,you
know,a normal family again.

29:35.460 --> 29:37.430
I believe you,dad.

29:42.970 --> 29:44.850
Doesn't mean you're any
good at this game,though.

29:45.140 --> 29:47.220
Look at that.You're
not bending your legs.

29:47.230 --> 29:50.920
You got to go from your
knees,right,knees,elbow,follow through.

29:56.490 --> 29:57.590
- Hey.
- Hey.

29:58.800 --> 29:59.540
Mr.Frobisher.

29:59.550 --> 30:01.270
I know.I know.I know.It's late.

30:01.280 --> 30:03.230
Yeah,look,I'm not
expecting you right now.

30:03.240 --> 30:05.070
I know you weren'T.I'm sorry,george.

30:05.080 --> 30:07.360
- This is nice.Very nice.
- Thank you.

30:08.870 --> 30:10.000
I'm arthur frobisher.

30:10.010 --> 30:11.700
That's my girlfriend,indira.

30:11.710 --> 30:13.340
Ah,that's nice.

30:15.440 --> 30:18.250
actually,look,I had
some thoughts,you know?

30:18.960 --> 30:22.780
Do you have a couple of glasses,'cause
i bought us one hell of a bottle.

30:22.790 --> 30:26.550
This is sipping whiskey.*****

30:26.560 --> 30:28.870
Hey,were you ever in
the boy scouts,george?

30:28.880 --> 30:31.320
I stopped after webelos,but,yeah.

30:31.330 --> 30:34.120
That's not boy scouts,man.

30:37.860 --> 30:39.900
- Pinewood derby,right?
- Yeah.

30:39.910 --> 30:41.710
Last place,this guy.

30:42.080 --> 30:43.780
Ask me why I'm proud.

30:44.390 --> 30:46.610
Because I made this myself.

30:46.620 --> 30:49.420
The other kids,they had
their dads do it for them.

30:52.740 --> 30:54.890
It's after midnight,mr.Frobisher.

30:54.900 --> 30:57.090
No,see,look,this...this stuff.

30:57.100 --> 31:00.440
All...this is my integrity.

31:01.130 --> 31:03.250
See what I'm say...here,look,look,look.

31:03.260 --> 31:05.640
Uh,what?Oh,yeah.

31:06.670 --> 31:10.230
third...third prize,middle
school spelling bee.

31:11.420 --> 31:12.160
Great.

31:12.170 --> 31:15.770
No...I'm dyslexic.Remember
I told you that?

31:15.780 --> 31:18.020
So that's determination.

31:18.030 --> 31:20.780
Here,look,look.Yeah,all right,varsity.

31:20.790 --> 31:21.740
This is interesting.

31:21.750 --> 31:25.220
Varsity-- that's the first time I
realized that I was a natural leader.

31:25.230 --> 31:29.450
Yeah,you know,all this stuff
that you're giving me is great.

31:30.130 --> 31:31.330
But this book...

31:31.340 --> 31:34.070
All right,look,look,look,all
right,here.Come here.

31:34.080 --> 31:36.900
This shirt,right?The
shirt you're wearing?

31:36.910 --> 31:38.790
You own other shirts,right?

31:38.800 --> 31:41.840
So,you know,if I come
along and say,you know,

31:41.850 --> 31:47.370
define you as the guy who wears
this shirt,I'd be wrong,right?

31:47.380 --> 31:49.830
'Cause...you know,you're
not just one thing.

31:49.840 --> 31:52.870
See,that's what I'm trying to
say You're not just one thing.

31:54.650 --> 31:57.220
Hey,I told you,right,that
i started off dirt-poor?

31:57.230 --> 31:59.110
You told me yesterday about that.

31:59.120 --> 32:01.130
Well,why don't you write...See...

32:01.140 --> 32:02.860
all right,hey,listen.

32:03.200 --> 32:07.290
17-- I came this close to
joining the army,you realize that?

32:07.300 --> 32:10.800
Look,look,mr.Frobisher,I haven't
seen indira for two weeks.

32:10.810 --> 32:15.350
She has been traveling,understand?This
is our night together,so...

32:15.520 --> 32:17.700
we'll just cut it short.

32:17.710 --> 32:20.150
Wait.All right,let's back up here.

32:21.430 --> 32:22.870
Tell me about your book.

32:22.880 --> 32:23.970
My novel?

32:23.980 --> 32:26.040
Sorry,your novel.

32:26.740 --> 32:29.010
It'S...it's hard to describe.

32:29.020 --> 32:31.260
Just tell me what it's about,will ya?

32:32.870 --> 32:35.490
On the face of it,it's a love story.

32:36.560 --> 32:42.620
It's about nostalgia and how that
affects our core relationship.

32:42.630 --> 32:46.780
Jesus,george.I mean
that sounds like crap.

32:46.790 --> 32:49.550
Are you kidding me?Look
what you're doing here.

32:49.560 --> 32:53.050
I mean,you're living
on...you're sleeping on a futon.

32:53.060 --> 32:55.380
Come on.You know...

32:55.390 --> 32:56.900
of course you're writing about my life.

32:56.910 --> 32:58.860
You don't have one,you know?

32:58.870 --> 33:01.320
And you're screwing the
immigrant because what...

33:01.330 --> 33:02.060
Excuse me?

33:02.070 --> 33:04.400
- You-you appreciate
their culture? - Excuse me?

33:04.410 --> 33:06.020
Is that what you say to yourself?

33:06.030 --> 33:08.490
The truth is you're just
trying to feel superior.

33:08.500 --> 33:12.680
Try running a $40 billion
industry.See how that makes you feel.

33:12.690 --> 33:13.280
Get out!

33:13.290 --> 33:16.550
Yeah,try managing 11,000 employees.

33:16.560 --> 33:17.960
I bet that gives you
a hard-on,you little...

33:17.970 --> 33:18.870
Just leave!

33:19.430 --> 33:20.510
Shit!

33:21.100 --> 33:25.000
You want to know why they're suing
me,you invisible piece of shit?

33:25.010 --> 33:26.430
'Cause I'm worth it.

33:26.440 --> 33:29.210
I hope that you lose everything.

33:29.220 --> 33:30.100
Now you be careful.

33:30.110 --> 33:32.650
'Cause you are an arrogant asshole.

33:34.740 --> 33:37.760
Hey,guess what?You're fired.

33:43.190 --> 33:45.890
he's fired.Tell him that,will ya?

33:48.340 --> 33:50.500
MY LIFE

33:57.130 --> 33:59.530
ARTHUR FROBISHER

33:59.690 --> 34:00.680
Dad?

34:01.280 --> 34:03.420
Yeah?I'm writting

34:07.080 --> 34:07.830
what?

34:07.840 --> 34:10.170
The police are here to see you.

34:25.270 --> 34:27.050
You think they'll arrest him?

34:27.520 --> 34:31.219
Simp a they'll slap him on the wrist.

34:31.500 --> 34:35.020
But publicity like this is
never a bad thing for us.

34:35.610 --> 34:37.060
You heading out?

34:37.340 --> 34:40.170
No,david's working,so
I'm sticking around.

34:40.179 --> 34:42.590
I've been thinking about you and david.

34:42.600 --> 34:44.080
You want a drink?

34:44.290 --> 34:45.889
Sure.

34:48.210 --> 34:50.610
I hope it works out for you two.

34:51.590 --> 34:53.010
Well,why wouldn't it?

34:53.969 --> 34:57.870
It's really tough,Juggling
a man and a career.

35:00.480 --> 35:02.820
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

35:04.420 --> 35:05.630
Now...

35:06.480 --> 35:10.670
my college boyfriend was the sweetest,

35:10.680 --> 35:13.590
most loyal guy you'll ever meet.

35:13.950 --> 35:18.710
We moved in together after graduation
and he helped put me through law school.

35:19.090 --> 35:23.310
He worked two jobs--
thankless,menial stuff.

35:23.320 --> 35:26.920
And...he was my first love.

35:27.970 --> 35:30.990
I dumped him as soon as I got my jd.

35:31.950 --> 35:33.370
Why?

35:33.380 --> 35:35.330
He had no ambition.

35:35.340 --> 35:37.400
It disgusted me.

35:37.770 --> 35:39.590
Really?

35:42.380 --> 35:44.260
It's biology,ellen.

35:44.270 --> 35:47.220
A man should want to be in charge.

35:47.230 --> 35:49.230
Now the trick is...

35:49.490 --> 35:52.780
making him feel like he actually is.

35:52.790 --> 35:55.870
Is that why phil did all
the talking at dinner?

36:01.820 --> 36:04.140
Yeah,he likes to hold court.

36:08.290 --> 36:09.920
What?

36:11.130 --> 36:13.730
I didn't tell david I met with gregory.

36:14.150 --> 36:15.910
Really?

36:16.640 --> 36:19.180
I guess I didn't want him to worry.

36:20.680 --> 36:26.320
Ellen,most men can't
handle an ambitious woman.

36:27.090 --> 36:32.300
It may take you a few tries,but
make sure you find one who can.

36:36.950 --> 36:38.450
It's david connor.

36:38.900 --> 36:40.060
Hey.

36:40.070 --> 36:41.680
Hey,uh,listen.

36:41.690 --> 36:45.810
I'm sorry to bug you,but,uh,I'm just
leaving work and i can't find my keys.

36:45.820 --> 36:47.510
Ooh,that sucks.

36:47.520 --> 36:51.290
Yeah,I had them in my jacket pocket.I
don't know if they fell out at your place.

36:51.300 --> 36:54.350
No,no.I would've seen
them.I'll take another look.

36:54.360 --> 36:57.300
Uh,anyway,give me a call
if you find them,okay?

36:57.310 --> 36:59.510
- Yeah,no problem.
- Thanks.

36:59.970 --> 37:00.570
Who was that?

37:00.580 --> 37:01.540
How you feeling,grandpa?

37:01.550 --> 37:02.930
Like a hundred bucks.

37:02.940 --> 37:04.430
I'm going out,I'll see you later.

37:08.500 --> 37:12.310
To tell the truth,I'm not
really sure what to expect,

37:12.320 --> 37:15.730
but mr.Frobisher sings your praises.

37:15.740 --> 37:18.890
Oh,sleep therapy is more
of an art than a science.

37:18.900 --> 37:22.160
Well,I can't sleep...

37:23.270 --> 37:25.760
and when I do,I have nightmares.

37:25.770 --> 37:28.510
What's the nature of your dreams?

37:28.520 --> 37:32.770
In one,my teeth fall out.

37:32.780 --> 37:34.390
It's pretty common.

37:34.400 --> 37:35.770
It's thought to signify...

37:35.780 --> 37:37.500
Insecurity...

37:38.280 --> 37:40.120
anxiety--
I know.

37:40.130 --> 37:43.030
Well,that's one interpretation,but
it can also signify...

37:43.680 --> 37:45.980
a secret you're keeping.

37:45.990 --> 37:51.630
More specifically,your overwhelming
fear that people will find it out.

37:55.490 --> 37:59.130
What?What's going on,mr.Fiske?

38:00.380 --> 38:02.420
Tell me.

38:06.500 --> 38:08.450
Let it out.

39:18.620 --> 39:20.010
Remember me?

39:20.800 --> 39:21.870
From the other night?

39:21.880 --> 39:23.850
Of course,I remember you.

39:23.860 --> 39:25.690
I came to see if you were okay.

39:27.010 --> 39:29.010
I wanted to give you my number.

39:59.250 --> 40:00.380
Yeah?

40:00.390 --> 40:02.370
Your boy--
gregory malina?

40:02.380 --> 40:03.320
Yes?

40:03.330 --> 40:04.730
He's in danger.

40:04.740 --> 40:05.770
What happened?

40:05.780 --> 40:07.090
You don't need to know.

40:07.100 --> 40:08.620
And if I want to subpoena him?

40:08.630 --> 40:10.340
Better do it quick.

40:31.180 --> 40:32.490
I need to talk to you.

40:32.850 --> 40:34.110
You can't be here.

40:34.120 --> 40:35.530
Ray?Who is it?

40:35.540 --> 40:38.980
It's the wrong address!Just
go back to sleep,mallory!

40:39.310 --> 40:40.750
You need to leave.You...

40:40.760 --> 40:42.940
Just give me five minutes,ray.

40:42.950 --> 40:44.680
Just give me five minutes.

40:44.690 --> 40:46.850
I-I've got a doberman.

40:47.150 --> 40:48.730
Please?

40:57.380 --> 40:58.910
Please?

41:11.130 --> 41:12.730
Ellen?

41:16.110 --> 41:17.770
Ellen?

41:44.770 --> 41:46.440
Ellen?

42:11.650 --> 42:14.240
Surprise.

42:14.980 --> 42:17.430
I said hello,and you didn't answer.

42:17.440 --> 42:22.510
So you figured I was one of those murderers who
leads you to your death with music and bubble baths?

42:22.520 --> 42:23.400
No.

42:24.170 --> 42:27.910
No,I lost my keys and the door was open.

42:30.160 --> 42:32.720
I guess I forgot to lock it.

42:33.080 --> 42:34.480
Right.

42:38.930 --> 42:40.910
Are you going to get in?

42:42.580 --> 42:45.010
What's the special occasion?

42:46.130 --> 42:48.010
I miss you.

43:04.490 --> 43:08.550
Look...I'm not proud of
it,but it's what david wanted.

43:09.770 --> 43:11.730
And last night,where were you?

43:12.450 --> 43:16.140
Here,at home.Why aren't you
talking to ellen parsons?

43:16.150 --> 43:17.270
Why should we?

43:17.280 --> 43:20.310
Because she's crazy...and jealous.

43:21.300 --> 43:23.080
This is ellen parsons.

43:23.090 --> 43:28.310
Stay away from my fiance or I
swear to god,I will come after you.
