01:01.669 --> 01:03.137
A meeting at an underground garage

01:03.171 --> 01:04.805
in the middle of the night?
Did he say what it was about?

01:04.839 --> 01:07.107
Nope, but he sounded
scared and desperate.

01:07.142 --> 01:09.209
What if it's a conspiracy?
Like Watergate.

01:09.244 --> 01:10.277
Or Deep Throat!

01:10.311 --> 01:11.945
Oh, how cool would that be?

01:11.980 --> 01:13.147
How much coffee have you had?

01:13.181 --> 01:14.348
Well, I'm up a 4:00 in the morning,

01:14.382 --> 01:15.649
so... a lot.

01:15.683 --> 01:17.117
But it's got to be something big, right?

01:17.152 --> 01:18.886
Or... Or why all the cloak and dagger?

01:18.920 --> 01:20.821
What do <i>you think it is?</i>

01:20.855 --> 01:22.356
You know, there's two things
I've learned in life, Sam.

01:22.390 --> 01:23.991
Nothing good happens after 3:00 a.m.

01:24.025 --> 01:26.487
And it's never what you think it is.

01:37.872 --> 01:39.333
Must be our guy.

01:50.351 --> 01:52.898
Can I, uh... Can I see some ID?

02:00.395 --> 02:02.262
Okay.

02:02.297 --> 02:03.730
Hey.

02:18.046 --> 02:19.079
Todd Garlin.

02:19.114 --> 02:21.281
This is my brother, Hugh.

02:21.316 --> 02:22.382
Thanks for coming.

02:22.417 --> 02:23.717
Why are we here, Mr. Garlin?

02:23.751 --> 02:26.053
Uh, because I need your help.

02:26.087 --> 02:27.721
Someone's trying to kill me.

02:27.755 --> 02:28.956
You have any idea who?

02:28.990 --> 02:31.191
Yeah, a hitman.

02:31.226 --> 02:32.793
Why is a hitman trying to kill you?

02:32.827 --> 02:34.194
Because...

02:36.297 --> 02:37.431
...I hired him to.

02:39.434 --> 02:49.192
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

02:49.244 --> 02:50.477
I don't understand.

02:50.512 --> 02:52.312
Why would you hire someone to kill you?

02:52.347 --> 02:54.915
Two months ago, I found out

02:54.949 --> 02:57.417
that I had terminal pancreatic cancer.

02:57.452 --> 02:59.586
I didn't want my wife and kids

02:59.621 --> 03:02.389
to put up with the burden
of caring for me.

03:02.423 --> 03:05.159
Life insurance doesn't pay out
if you commit suicide, so...

03:05.193 --> 03:06.827
So you hired a hitman to do it for you?

03:06.861 --> 03:08.962
Yeah, he specializes in making the deaths

03:08.997 --> 03:10.430
look like accidents.

03:10.465 --> 03:14.568
Problem is, I just found out
that I was misdiagnosed.

03:14.602 --> 03:16.403
Turns out, I'm not gonna die after all.

03:16.437 --> 03:18.405
Not from cancer anyway.

03:18.439 --> 03:20.307
Well, can't you just call off the hit?

03:20.341 --> 03:21.775
I didn't want anyone to trace it
back to me,

03:21.809 --> 03:23.477
so I found someone on the dark web.

03:23.511 --> 03:25.946
I have no idea who he is,
what he looks like,

03:25.980 --> 03:27.649
or how to stop him.

03:28.449 --> 03:30.784
A lot of these people online
claim they'll kill for money,

03:30.818 --> 03:33.420
but they're scammers. They're
teenagers pulling pranks.

03:33.454 --> 03:34.388
N-no.

03:34.422 --> 03:37.524
This one's real.
He calls himself "Azrael."

03:37.559 --> 03:39.526
As in the biblical Angel of Death?

03:39.561 --> 03:41.461
Yeah. H-He's legit.

03:41.496 --> 03:44.298
A week ago, a falling air
conditioner almost crushed me.

03:44.332 --> 03:47.201
Three days ago, a car nearly hit me.

03:47.235 --> 03:49.303
I've been hiding out from him
in this cheap motel,

03:49.337 --> 03:52.172
but he must've found me. He made
my balcony railing collapse.

03:52.207 --> 03:55.409
If I hadn't fallen on that convertible...
I'd be dead.

03:55.443 --> 03:57.511
Look, I don't know where else to turn.

03:57.545 --> 03:59.613
I need you to find him
before he kills me.

04:04.252 --> 04:05.385
All right. Let's start at the hotel.

04:05.420 --> 04:06.386
Who else knew you were there?

04:06.421 --> 04:07.387
No one.

04:07.422 --> 04:09.389
What about your family?
Your brother? Your wife?

04:09.424 --> 04:10.857
No. Oh, no, my wife?

04:10.892 --> 04:12.559
No, she doesn't know anything about this.

04:12.594 --> 04:13.894
Wait, a hitman is coming for you,

04:13.928 --> 04:15.128
and you haven't told your wife?

04:15.163 --> 04:16.363
How could I tell her?

04:16.397 --> 04:17.564
She just found out I'm gonna live

04:17.599 --> 04:19.132
and now I could wind up dead again.

04:19.166 --> 04:20.334
Well, where does she think you are?

04:20.368 --> 04:21.902
At the Peterson Clinic in Kansas,

04:21.935 --> 04:24.171
making sure my scans are clear.

04:24.205 --> 04:26.473
How'd you get to the hotel?
Took a bus? Taxi? Lyft?

04:26.507 --> 04:29.643
No, I drove. But I wasn't followed.
I made sure of that.

04:29.677 --> 04:32.045
You may not have been followed,
but you probably were tracked.

04:32.080 --> 04:33.113
Where's you car now?

04:33.147 --> 04:35.482
It's back at the hotel.
It's the silver Forester.

04:35.516 --> 04:37.351
All right. We're gonna need the keys.

04:37.385 --> 04:39.519
We're gonna take you back to our office.
You're gonna be safe there.

04:39.554 --> 04:40.988
You and my assistant, you guys are gonna

04:41.022 --> 04:42.589
try to track down your hitman online.

04:42.624 --> 04:45.392
Sam and I will go to the hotel,
see if he left any trace.

04:51.866 --> 04:53.333
There's a lot of glass.

04:53.368 --> 04:54.768
You're sure this place is safe?

04:54.802 --> 04:56.203
All entrances and exits are secure

04:56.237 --> 04:57.571
with trip alarms and cameras.

04:57.605 --> 04:59.449
If someone's coming, we'll know.

05:00.141 --> 05:02.376
There's no trace of an Azrael
in the Perdition boards

05:02.410 --> 05:03.610
or in the Burn Web archives.

05:03.645 --> 05:05.679
Yeah, I-I know. I looked, too.

05:05.713 --> 05:07.748
He went dark right after I hired him.

05:07.782 --> 05:09.616
Maybe we could trace the money.

05:09.651 --> 05:10.877
How did you pay him?

05:11.619 --> 05:13.754
Bitcoin, with zero-coin add-on.

05:13.788 --> 05:14.921
Dude...
- Yeah, I-I-I know.

05:14.956 --> 05:17.858
But in my defense, it was
supposed to be untraceable.

05:17.892 --> 05:19.259
Is this the guy?

05:19.294 --> 05:21.261
Who are you? How'd you get in here?

05:21.296 --> 05:22.195
You said this place was secure!

05:22.230 --> 05:23.897
That's Monica.
That's Ms. Swift's assistant.

05:23.931 --> 05:26.033
- She's part of the team.
- Oh.

05:26.067 --> 05:27.634
Why is she wearing mouse ears?

05:27.669 --> 05:28.969
Death is coming for you.

05:29.003 --> 05:30.037
What is that? A threat?

05:30.071 --> 05:33.240
- It's just how she talks.
- And dresses. It's creepy.

05:33.274 --> 05:35.909
As a survivor of multiple
near-death experiences,

05:35.943 --> 05:37.444
you're a perfect subject.

05:37.478 --> 05:39.479
- She's a psych student.
- Subject for what?

05:39.514 --> 05:41.415
A test that measures personality traits

05:41.449 --> 05:44.051
and how extreme stressors,
like almost dying,

05:44.085 --> 05:45.419
can reveal who you really are.

05:45.453 --> 05:47.421
Uh, my whole world's upside down.

05:47.455 --> 05:49.956
I'm not sure I really know who I am.

05:49.991 --> 05:51.840
All the more reason to take the test.

05:54.629 --> 05:55.896
He survived that?

05:55.930 --> 05:57.631
What, does this guy have nine lives?

05:57.665 --> 05:58.899
He's going through them fast.

05:58.933 --> 06:00.567
Well, then we need to move faster,

06:00.601 --> 06:02.569
before the hitman tries again.

06:02.603 --> 06:05.599
We need to get into that room,
take a look at that balcony.

06:06.708 --> 06:08.608
What's our angle?

06:08.643 --> 06:11.011
David Addison. Safety Inspector.

06:11.045 --> 06:13.847
And I'm Madelyn Hayes. We're
investigating the accident.

06:15.049 --> 06:18.618
Careful. It's a pretty steep drop.

06:23.491 --> 06:24.791
I fell off a balcony once.

06:24.826 --> 06:26.293
Vodka.

06:26.327 --> 06:28.288
Luckily, I landed in the pool.

06:28.996 --> 06:31.298
You ever have a near-death experience?

06:31.332 --> 06:33.633
I was a cop, so yeah.

06:33.668 --> 06:35.086
What was the scariest?

06:37.205 --> 06:41.141
Actually, my closest call
came when I was 15.

06:41.551 --> 06:43.009
I was surfing Pipeline,

06:43.044 --> 06:45.472
and I nearly drowned
after a three-wave hold down.

06:46.581 --> 06:49.983
My buddies found me unconscious,

06:50.017 --> 06:51.685
floating face down in the water.

06:51.719 --> 06:53.553
I had to be airlifted to a hospital.

06:53.588 --> 06:55.055
Terrifying.

06:55.089 --> 06:56.656
What happened?

06:56.691 --> 06:58.625
I lived.

07:04.699 --> 07:05.988
Looks like someone used a welding torch

07:06.013 --> 07:08.802
to weaken the steel, rig it to fall.

07:08.836 --> 07:10.137
The guy was thorough.

07:10.171 --> 07:11.705
Oxidized the metal edges
to make it look like

07:11.739 --> 07:14.000
a pre-existing structural defect.

07:14.742 --> 07:16.343
But the hitman had
to find a way to make Todd

07:16.377 --> 07:18.512
come out to the balcony
and lean on the railing.

07:18.546 --> 07:20.580
Well, Todd said he heard a car alarm.

07:20.615 --> 07:21.638
I mean, that seems random.

07:21.672 --> 07:22.797
How would he know that
would draw Todd out?

07:22.832 --> 07:25.085
Are you kidding? Have you seen Todd?

07:25.119 --> 07:28.355
It doesn't take an actor to get
inside his paranoid mind set.

07:28.389 --> 07:30.424
I think the hitman could be
pretty confident

07:30.458 --> 07:31.691
that he'd come check it out.

07:31.726 --> 07:33.693
If we can identify which car he set off,

07:33.728 --> 07:35.228
maybe we can ID him.

07:35.263 --> 07:36.997
"Whatever plans you make,

07:37.031 --> 07:38.565
there's always something unexpected

07:38.599 --> 07:39.699
that will interfere with them."

07:39.734 --> 07:40.767
Strongly agree.

07:40.802 --> 07:42.536
Interesting.

07:42.570 --> 07:44.871
"People's misfortunes result
from the mistakes they make."

07:44.906 --> 07:46.339
Strongly disagree.

07:46.374 --> 07:49.109
Sometimes, they result
from a random misdiagnosis

07:49.143 --> 07:50.911
that destroys their entire world.

07:50.945 --> 07:51.945
Huh.

07:51.979 --> 07:53.113
What?

07:53.147 --> 07:54.714
What does it say about me?

07:54.749 --> 07:55.949
We have to get through all the questions

07:55.983 --> 07:58.084
before I can delve into analysis.
- Ah.

07:58.119 --> 08:00.020
Todd, it's for you.

08:00.054 --> 08:03.290
Todd, could you recognize
the car alarm if you heard it?

08:03.324 --> 08:04.623
<i>Yeah. I think so. Why?</i>

08:04.658 --> 08:07.394
Hey, Berto, pull up sound files
for car alarms,

08:07.428 --> 08:09.596
see if you can narrow down
which type of car it came from.

08:09.630 --> 08:10.931
<i>On it.</i>

08:10.965 --> 08:12.032
Do you think the car's still here?

08:12.066 --> 08:14.034
No idea. But Todd's car is.

08:14.068 --> 08:16.730
And I'm betting the hitman was
using it to track him.

08:19.273 --> 08:20.313
No, it was...

08:20.342 --> 08:23.410
It was less blurpy, more tooty.

08:23.444 --> 08:25.946
Okay. How about this one?

08:28.082 --> 08:29.616
A bit too brassy.

08:29.650 --> 08:31.785
Who knew there were so many car alarms?

08:33.154 --> 08:36.789
Warmer, but it was more
of a squawky waaank.

08:36.823 --> 08:39.960
Ugh, nothing but candy wrappers
and old bottles back here.

08:39.994 --> 08:41.328
Find anything down there?

08:43.798 --> 08:45.932
Yeah, found this.

08:45.967 --> 08:47.801
It's attached to the car's
electrical system.

08:47.835 --> 08:48.835
Is that a tracking device?

08:48.870 --> 08:50.670
Not like any I've ever seen.

08:52.106 --> 08:53.039
Yeah, Berto, what do you got?

08:53.074 --> 08:54.641
<i>Narrowed down the car alarm.</i>

08:54.675 --> 08:58.021
<i>Chevy, manufactured between 2013 to 2018.</i>

08:59.347 --> 09:01.248
Blue Spark.

09:06.888 --> 09:08.755
That's it! That's the one.

09:08.789 --> 09:11.858
That's great work. All right, hang tight.

09:11.893 --> 09:14.494
All right, let's see if the
hotel had video surveillance.

09:15.630 --> 09:18.598
So you're the people
who keep setting off my alarm?

09:18.633 --> 09:20.867
No. Why? Did it go off before?

09:20.902 --> 09:22.335
At like 3:00 in the morning.

09:22.370 --> 09:23.436
Did you see the railing collapse?

09:23.471 --> 09:24.671
Yeah, it scared the hell out of me.

09:24.705 --> 09:25.639
So you were out here?

09:25.673 --> 09:27.707
Did you see anyone else
in the parking lot?

09:27.742 --> 09:28.842
Just a guy standing by a pickup.

09:28.876 --> 09:31.778
When the railing collapsed,
he got in and drove away.

09:31.812 --> 09:34.014
You happen to see what he looked
like or the make of the truck?

09:34.048 --> 09:35.615
Didn't really get a look at him.

09:35.650 --> 09:38.485
But it was a black Silverado pickup.

09:43.224 --> 09:45.025
Black Silverado?
That's not much to go on.

09:45.059 --> 09:46.826
Yeah, and the hotel surveillance
stopped working

09:46.861 --> 09:48.662
during the Clinton administration.

09:48.696 --> 09:50.497
But your hitman did leave
something behind.

09:50.531 --> 09:52.699
This was attached to your car.

09:52.733 --> 09:54.701
We think this is how he followed you.

09:54.735 --> 09:56.036
So if we can find out who made it,

09:56.070 --> 09:57.704
we may be able to track down
a point of sale.

09:57.738 --> 09:58.838
Trace him from there.

09:58.873 --> 10:00.373
Oh.

10:00.408 --> 10:01.575
I can help with that.

10:03.778 --> 10:05.679
I think this is the first
time since I've met you

10:05.713 --> 10:07.681
that your hands weren't shaking.

10:07.715 --> 10:09.215
Yeah, I've always been

10:09.250 --> 10:11.718
more comfortable with machines
than with people.

10:11.752 --> 10:13.887
I work in quality control.

10:13.921 --> 10:15.488
You heard of MegaTech?

10:15.523 --> 10:16.890
They make that heart monitor watch?

10:16.924 --> 10:19.659
Yeah! The Aorta Recorda.

10:19.694 --> 10:21.928
And the Smarty Pans,
the Intelli-Brella...

10:21.963 --> 10:23.830
Anyway, that's where I work.

10:23.864 --> 10:26.600
I take things apart for a living,

10:26.634 --> 10:29.069
unlock their secrets,
find their vulnerabilities.

10:29.103 --> 10:31.204
You're a reverse engineer.

10:31.238 --> 10:32.839
You pull things apart,
figure out how they work,

10:32.873 --> 10:33.873
and all their flaws.

10:33.908 --> 10:37.996
Once I identify the problem,
I know how to fix it.

10:41.882 --> 10:44.217
Wish I could do that with my life.

10:44.251 --> 10:46.886
Took facing cancer to see some things.

10:46.921 --> 10:50.008
Like how I've been
a lousy husband and father.

10:50.825 --> 10:52.802
What makes you think that?

10:53.561 --> 10:55.695
I overheard my family talking,

10:55.730 --> 10:57.931
saying what a disappointment I was.

10:57.965 --> 10:59.466
Ouch.

10:59.500 --> 11:02.736
But, you know, finding out
you were cancer-free,

11:02.770 --> 11:04.938
didn't that feel like
you had a second chance?

11:04.972 --> 11:06.973
Yeah, it did.

11:07.008 --> 11:08.742
It made me determined to be a better man,

11:08.776 --> 11:09.976
turn things around.

11:10.011 --> 11:11.911
Don't you think being honest
with your wife

11:11.946 --> 11:13.313
would be a good place to start?

11:14.982 --> 11:16.108
And tell her what?

11:16.112 --> 11:17.753
That I thought I had terminal cancer,

11:17.818 --> 11:18.985
then I found out I didn't, but by then,

11:19.020 --> 11:21.988
I'd hired a hitman to kill me
and now I can't call him off?

11:22.624 --> 11:24.391
Yeah, that'd be a lot to take in.
- Yeah.

11:25.860 --> 11:28.995
Todd, if there's a way,
we'll find this guy.

11:30.097 --> 11:32.132
Well, not from this, you won't.

11:32.166 --> 11:35.001
Whoever fabricated this really
knew what they were doing.

11:35.036 --> 11:36.936
Custom components...

11:36.971 --> 11:40.840
definitely not store-bought,
which makes them untraceable.

11:42.943 --> 11:46.913
If we can't trace the parts,
maybe we can trace the skills.

11:48.816 --> 11:51.918
Who'd have the knowledge
to build something like this?

11:53.054 --> 11:54.821
- Any luck?
- Nothing.

11:54.855 --> 11:57.424
There's no video surveillance
in the area around the hotel.

11:57.458 --> 11:58.525
And there's over several thousand

11:58.559 --> 12:02.162
black Silverados registered
in L.A. County alone.

12:02.196 --> 12:05.598
Yeah, how many of them are owned
by electrical engineers?

12:12.073 --> 12:14.007
Avery Rush.

12:14.041 --> 12:16.209
This is the 10th black-
Silverado-owning engineer

12:16.243 --> 12:18.178
that we've checked out,
with a dozen to go.

12:18.212 --> 12:19.338
There has to be a better way.

12:19.373 --> 12:21.181
Shoe-leather's part of the job.

12:21.215 --> 12:24.317
Yeah, I prefer how we did it on my show.

12:24.351 --> 12:27.520
Cut to my character finding
where the bad guy was.

12:37.598 --> 12:39.117
Eddie.

12:40.534 --> 12:43.236
Acetylene torches and a welding mask.

12:43.270 --> 12:46.372
Maybe this guy's been doing
a little balcony work.

12:46.407 --> 12:48.253
Doesn't look like he's around.

13:05.526 --> 13:07.576
Eddie, look.

13:11.599 --> 13:13.733
Photos of the balcony railing.

13:16.537 --> 13:18.938
And plans to make it fall.

13:22.376 --> 13:24.110
- We should go.
- I thought we were here to negotiate.

13:24.145 --> 13:26.012
No, this is not the type of guy
you want to negotiate with.

13:26.046 --> 13:27.914
We know who he is. Now we call the cops.

13:29.635 --> 13:30.717
Aaah!

13:37.024 --> 13:38.509
Wha...

13:41.671 --> 13:43.271
It's electrified. High voltage.

13:43.306 --> 13:44.668
Do not touch it.

13:48.477 --> 13:51.046
I have no bars.

13:51.704 --> 13:53.048
Me neither.

13:53.082 --> 13:55.026
It's like the signal's being blocked.

13:55.777 --> 13:57.552
It's a Faraday cage.

13:57.586 --> 13:58.753
We had this in one of my episodes,

13:58.788 --> 14:02.558
where they used the metal grates
to block all radio signals.

14:02.592 --> 14:04.226
This guy's a pro.

14:04.261 --> 14:06.629
And if that warm cup of coffee
is any indication, he's nearby.

14:06.663 --> 14:07.763
We got to figure out a way out of here.

14:07.798 --> 14:09.136
How?
- I don't know.

14:09.170 --> 14:10.410
There's gotta be a switch, a trigger,

14:10.444 --> 14:12.268
something that's gonna turn off
that electrical field.

14:12.302 --> 14:13.970
There isn't.

14:15.002 --> 14:17.673
It's very well constructed.

14:17.708 --> 14:20.609
Somewhat of a passion project of mine.

14:20.644 --> 14:22.778
Who are you people?

14:22.813 --> 14:24.246
We're not here for you.

14:24.281 --> 14:27.684
We... We represent a man
named Todd Garlin.

14:28.452 --> 14:30.519
Th-The guy who hired you to kill him?

14:32.856 --> 14:34.256
Doesn't ring a bell.

14:34.291 --> 14:35.524
Sure it does.

14:35.559 --> 14:38.861
Air Conditioner Todd, Balcony Todd.

14:38.895 --> 14:41.030
All we're saying is
if you know a Todd Garlin

14:41.064 --> 14:43.265
a-and he did hire you to kill him,

14:43.300 --> 14:44.851
he just wants to terminate his contract.

14:44.886 --> 14:46.635
Bad choice of words.

14:46.670 --> 14:50.473
This guy, Todd, or anyone else
know the two of you are here?

14:50.507 --> 14:52.641
Yeah, plenty of people,
and if we don't check in,

14:52.676 --> 14:54.419
they're gonna come looking for us.

14:56.646 --> 14:57.947
I'll cancel the hit.

14:57.981 --> 15:00.383
Great. That's great!

15:00.417 --> 15:04.387
Yeah. But I can't let you leave.

15:04.421 --> 15:07.123
Wait. Come on! We'll triple your fee!

15:08.099 --> 15:09.892
Where's he going?

15:09.926 --> 15:11.827
He's gonna go check my SUV.

15:11.862 --> 15:13.062
He's gonna figure out who we are

15:13.096 --> 15:14.397
and he's gonna come back here and...

15:14.431 --> 15:16.065
A-And let us go?

15:16.767 --> 15:18.634
Oh, I was trying to be optimistic.

15:18.668 --> 15:21.137
He can't afford to let us go.

15:21.171 --> 15:22.905
Now that he's been exposed,
he's gonna come back here,

15:22.939 --> 15:24.740
he's gonna torch this place,
and he's gonna disappear.

15:24.775 --> 15:26.475
You think he's actually going to kill us?

15:26.510 --> 15:29.178
Yeah, and I don't know
what to do to stop him.

15:30.496 --> 15:32.014
So this could be it?

15:36.753 --> 15:38.921
I'm sorry, Sam.

15:39.556 --> 15:41.357
Shut up.

15:41.391 --> 15:43.559
Sam?

15:43.593 --> 15:44.827
Uh...
- Hey, if we're gonna die...

15:44.861 --> 15:46.695
What are you doing? Take off your belt.

15:46.730 --> 15:48.864
I-I don't... I don't think
this is the right time.

15:48.899 --> 15:50.699
Just stop talking. We're doing this.

15:53.236 --> 15:55.671
I am not going down without a fight,

15:55.705 --> 15:57.673
and I'm definitely not dying

15:57.707 --> 16:00.709
in some dank garage in the Valley.

16:00.744 --> 16:02.278
Fabric and leather are non-conductive.

16:02.312 --> 16:03.446
We need to get the gun.

16:11.755 --> 16:13.689
Be careful...

16:13.723 --> 16:15.925
Slowly...

16:19.429 --> 16:20.729
Okay, so close.

16:20.764 --> 16:22.089
Almost.

16:23.667 --> 16:25.634
I think that gun takes more than a C cup.

16:27.671 --> 16:28.737
Ooh! You got it!

16:28.772 --> 16:31.574
Slow.

16:31.608 --> 16:32.575
Hurry! He's coming.

16:36.780 --> 16:38.481
Clever.

16:38.515 --> 16:40.858
But not clever enough.

16:51.862 --> 16:53.662
Go! Go!

17:04.840 --> 17:06.474
Looks like Avery Rush was a victim

17:06.510 --> 17:07.843
of his own engineering.

17:07.877 --> 17:09.678
You're gonna find more evidence inside

17:09.713 --> 17:11.981
linking him to at least
a dozen contract killings.

17:12.015 --> 17:14.116
Cyber's been trying to track
down Azrael for years.

17:14.151 --> 17:15.184
How'd you find him?

17:15.218 --> 17:17.786
Our client suspected
he was on the guy's hit list.

17:17.820 --> 17:19.855
He hired us to track him down
before he can complete the job.

17:19.890 --> 17:21.063
Who's the client?

17:21.097 --> 17:22.790
Right now, he'd prefer to stay anonymous.

17:22.826 --> 17:24.660
But I'm pretty certain I can convince him

17:24.694 --> 17:25.994
to give you a statement.

17:26.654 --> 17:28.329
Thanks.

17:28.365 --> 17:29.832
Oh, and speaking of statements,

17:29.866 --> 17:32.134
how'd you like me to characterize this

17:32.169 --> 17:33.836
in my report?

17:33.870 --> 17:35.638
I believe...

17:35.672 --> 17:37.806
these are yours.

17:40.544 --> 17:42.789
How long were you guys
in that cage anyway?

17:50.153 --> 17:52.555
I don't know how to thank you.
I'd be dead without you guys.

17:52.589 --> 17:53.689
Well, you can start by going home

17:53.723 --> 17:55.724
and having your second chance.

17:55.759 --> 17:56.659
Thank you guys, too.

17:56.693 --> 17:57.843
Good luck, dude.

17:57.877 --> 17:59.695
Hey, we had your Forester
towed over here.

17:59.729 --> 18:01.463
Checked it over. Clean and ready to go.

18:01.498 --> 18:03.799
It's parked out front.
Still got the keys?

18:03.833 --> 18:06.969
Uh... yeah. Thanks.

18:07.003 --> 18:08.804
Well, I guess this is it.

18:08.838 --> 18:10.472
Wait, but we haven't finished the test.

18:10.507 --> 18:11.840
Sorry, Monica.

18:11.875 --> 18:14.810
I can't wait to start my life over again.

18:14.844 --> 18:16.746
Bye.

18:17.847 --> 18:19.982
I'll do the test.

18:20.016 --> 18:22.351
You know all this talk
about near-death experiences,

18:22.385 --> 18:23.919
and we, actually, almost died today.

18:23.954 --> 18:25.721
This has me thinking about all the stuff

18:25.755 --> 18:27.352
I still want to do that I haven't done.

18:27.386 --> 18:28.638
Yeah, like what?

18:28.672 --> 18:29.892
Climb the pyramids?

18:29.926 --> 18:31.060
I've done that.

18:31.094 --> 18:32.328
Hot air balloon over Europe?

18:32.362 --> 18:33.429
I've done that, too.

18:33.463 --> 18:34.897
So what haven't you done?

18:34.931 --> 18:36.765
I have a list.

18:36.800 --> 18:38.934
What about you, Eddie?
What do you want to do?

18:38.969 --> 18:41.570
Is there some big wave
off the coast of Tahiti?

18:41.605 --> 18:43.706
No, actually, I don't surf anymore.

18:43.740 --> 18:45.149
Not since that day.

18:46.977 --> 18:48.344
Well, there has to be something.

18:48.378 --> 18:49.845
You know, don't you have a bucket list,

18:49.879 --> 18:51.947
a goal, a dream?

18:51.982 --> 18:53.682
Used to.

18:58.287 --> 18:59.955
It's Todd.

18:59.990 --> 19:01.289
Hey, Todd.

19:01.324 --> 19:03.425
Did you forget something?
Everything okay?

19:03.460 --> 19:04.960
<i>No.</i>

19:04.995 --> 19:06.228
<i>I-I realized I'm about to go home,</i>

19:06.263 --> 19:08.464
<i>about to restart my life.</i>

19:08.498 --> 19:11.934
I know I need to tell Lisa
the truth about everything,

19:11.968 --> 19:13.636
but I-I don't know how.

19:13.670 --> 19:16.438
<i>I've spent so much time
focusing on dying,</i>

19:16.473 --> 19:17.640
<i>I-I haven't figured out how to live.</i>

19:17.674 --> 19:21.143
How do I become the husband
and the father I want to be?

19:21.177 --> 19:23.445
<i>You just do.</i>

19:23.480 --> 19:24.880
You just need to be present.

19:24.914 --> 19:27.149
Wh... Give them presents?

19:27.183 --> 19:28.651
What?

19:28.685 --> 19:30.653
No, I said, "be present."

19:30.687 --> 19:31.987
There's some weird noise on the line.

19:32.022 --> 19:33.756
That's EMF frequency interference.

19:33.790 --> 19:34.981
<i>Yeah... hear... too.</i>

19:35.016 --> 19:36.258
I don't know where it's coming from.

19:36.293 --> 19:37.993
Get out of the car.

19:38.028 --> 19:39.795
Get out! Now!

19:50.270 --> 19:51.702
Given the severity of the blast,

19:51.737 --> 19:53.708
your injuries were relatively minor.

19:53.734 --> 19:55.668
You're lucky you got away
from that car when you did.

19:55.703 --> 19:56.740
So I'll live?

19:56.774 --> 19:58.204
We still have a few more tests to run,

19:58.239 --> 19:59.339
but yes, you'll live.

19:59.373 --> 20:00.533
Thanks, Doctor.

20:01.842 --> 20:03.309
Hey, what the hell happened?

20:03.344 --> 20:05.445
I thought my hitman was supposed
to be out of commission.

20:05.479 --> 20:06.779
- He is.
- Then how d...

20:06.814 --> 20:08.781
Your hitman didn't plant that bomb.

20:08.816 --> 20:09.983
We swept your car

20:10.017 --> 20:10.950
when it was brought to the office.

20:10.985 --> 20:12.018
It was clean.

20:12.052 --> 20:14.854
The bomb was planted after
Avery Rush was in custody.

20:14.889 --> 20:18.358
Are you saying that someone else
tried to kill me?

20:18.392 --> 20:20.126
Sure looks that way.

20:20.160 --> 20:22.495
Do you know anyone
that might want you dead?

20:22.530 --> 20:25.632
Just me. Before. Back when I was dying.

20:25.666 --> 20:29.035
Anyway, this is like "Final Destination."

20:29.069 --> 20:30.803
Maybe I was really supposed
to die of cancer,

20:30.838 --> 20:32.572
and this is God's way
of fixing his mistake.

20:32.606 --> 20:34.474
God doesn't plant car bombs.

20:34.508 --> 20:36.876
Someone's after you.
We have to find out why.

20:36.911 --> 20:38.578
What am I supposed to do in the meantime?

20:38.612 --> 20:39.879
Go into hiding?

20:39.914 --> 20:41.014
What if they try to kill me again?

20:41.048 --> 20:44.517
I'm like a sitting duck here.
Might as well be dead.

20:45.786 --> 20:47.153
That's not such a bad idea.

20:47.187 --> 20:48.606
What?

20:49.390 --> 20:51.357
For Todd to be dead.

20:51.392 --> 20:53.026
That way, no one would be
trying to kill you.

20:53.060 --> 20:55.161
You'd be safe, and it would buy us time.

20:55.195 --> 20:57.764
Wait, you want to fake his death?
- It's perfect.

20:57.798 --> 20:59.899
We did it on an episode of "Hot Suspect."

20:59.934 --> 21:02.936
It keeps our witness safe
until we catch the killer.

21:02.970 --> 21:04.370
Really?

21:04.405 --> 21:06.773
A fake death helped catch
a fictional killer?

21:06.807 --> 21:08.274
That's amazing.

21:08.309 --> 21:10.710
Maybe if I'm dead, people will
stop trying to kill me.

21:10.744 --> 21:12.445
This isn't an episode of "Hot Suspect."

21:12.479 --> 21:14.881
You know what it takes to fake
a death in the real world?

21:14.915 --> 21:17.183
Cops, doctors, the hospital...

21:17.217 --> 21:18.952
They all have to be involved.

21:18.986 --> 21:21.688
Eddie, what do cops,
doctors, and hospitals

21:21.722 --> 21:23.289
all have in common?

21:23.324 --> 21:25.525
They're committed to saving lives.

21:25.559 --> 21:27.026
Don't you want to save Todd's?

21:32.266 --> 21:33.900
Fake his death?

21:33.934 --> 21:35.702
Do you have any idea what you're asking?

21:35.736 --> 21:37.804
Yeah, I know exactly what I'm asking.

21:37.838 --> 21:40.073
Chris, I'm just trying
to keep the guy alive.

21:40.825 --> 21:42.875
Look cops, doctors,

21:42.910 --> 21:45.311
aren't they all committed
to saving lives?

21:45.346 --> 21:48.047
No, they're committed to keeping
their jobs and pensions.

21:48.624 --> 21:49.983
This was her idea, wasn't it?

21:50.017 --> 21:51.718
That obvious?
- Mm-hmm.

21:51.752 --> 21:52.919
Along with the stupid speech

21:52.953 --> 21:55.005
about cops and doctors saving lives.

21:56.457 --> 21:58.925
But I got to admit,
I see the logic in it.

21:58.959 --> 21:59.959
You do?

21:59.994 --> 22:01.628
It might give us a chance to figure
out what the hell's going on

22:01.662 --> 22:03.571
without putting your client at risk.

22:03.571 --> 22:05.372
So you'll help us?

22:05.407 --> 22:06.707
Yeah.

22:06.741 --> 22:08.776
And she is right about
the saving lives thing.

22:08.810 --> 22:10.110
But whatever you learn, you share.

22:10.145 --> 22:12.279
Done. What'd you find at the bomb site?

22:12.313 --> 22:13.781
CSI found the detonator.

22:13.815 --> 22:16.683
Bomb was triggered remotely
by a cellphone.

22:16.718 --> 22:18.051
Cellphone?
- Mm-hmm.

22:18.086 --> 22:19.420
I pulled warrants to get tower logs

22:19.454 --> 22:20.888
from every wireless carrier.

22:20.922 --> 22:22.523
With any luck, we'll be able to pinpoint

22:22.557 --> 22:24.326
where the detonation call came from.

22:25.059 --> 22:29.029
Sam, if we do this,
I'm gonna need to tell Lisa.

22:29.063 --> 22:32.699
I can't have her and the kids
thinking I'm actually dead.

22:32.734 --> 22:34.920
She needs to be okay with this.

22:35.770 --> 22:37.623
Will you go to her?

22:37.658 --> 22:38.772
She loves you.

22:38.807 --> 22:41.408
She watched everything that you're in.

22:41.443 --> 22:43.210
She'll listen to you.

22:45.847 --> 22:48.816
So, you're saying my husband, Todd,

22:48.850 --> 22:51.752
sent Sam Swift to talk to me?

22:51.786 --> 22:53.387
How does he even know you?

22:53.421 --> 22:55.556
Actually, we just met.

22:55.590 --> 22:56.790
In Kansas?

22:56.825 --> 22:58.559
I'm sorry, Lisa.

22:58.593 --> 23:00.627
Todd's not in Kansas anymore.

23:00.662 --> 23:02.930
I can't believe after
everything we've been through,

23:02.964 --> 23:04.665
he would lie to me like this.

23:04.699 --> 23:05.917
Todd loves you and the kids.

23:05.951 --> 23:07.768
I think this was just his misguided way

23:07.802 --> 23:08.836
of trying to be noble.

23:08.870 --> 23:12.639
You said you... you stopped the hitman.

23:12.674 --> 23:14.908
S-So who is trying to kill him now?

23:14.943 --> 23:16.034
We don't know.

23:16.068 --> 23:17.311
That's why we need to fake his death,

23:17.345 --> 23:19.112
to give us time to find them.

23:19.147 --> 23:21.281
Did Todd have any enemies
that you know of?

23:21.316 --> 23:24.351
He didn't have a lot of friends,
but nobody hates him.

23:24.385 --> 23:26.653
Have you noticed anything
weird or out of the ordinary

23:26.688 --> 23:28.622
around here the last couple weeks?

23:29.725 --> 23:31.859
There was an Escalade I didn't recognize

23:31.893 --> 23:33.760
parked across the street a few times.

23:33.795 --> 23:35.662
I could've sworn there was someone in it,

23:35.697 --> 23:37.431
but the windows were blacked-out.

23:37.465 --> 23:40.601
Now, please, I need to see Todd.

23:44.172 --> 23:46.940
I am so sorry for all I put
you through with the illness,

23:47.743 --> 23:49.776
all I put you through after.

23:49.811 --> 23:51.612
Lisa, I swear, when this is all done,

23:51.646 --> 23:53.113
I'm gonna be the husband and father

23:53.147 --> 23:54.915
you always wanted me to be.

23:56.818 --> 23:58.019
Ow.
- Sorry.

23:58.053 --> 24:00.854
No, no. No, it's good.

24:04.492 --> 24:06.627
Just got word from Detective Rollins.

24:06.661 --> 24:09.396
The hospital staff says we're good to go.

24:09.430 --> 24:11.131
It's time to die, Todd.

24:11.165 --> 24:13.166
Can't you just say, "He died."

24:13.201 --> 24:15.168
Release a statement or something?

24:15.203 --> 24:16.904
We got to make it convincing
in case our killer's

24:16.938 --> 24:19.873
hanging around the hospital,
waiting to see what's happened.

24:19.908 --> 24:22.709
So how exactly are you
planning to kill me?

24:22.744 --> 24:25.746
<i>Blue team to ICU. Blue team to ICU.</i>

24:25.780 --> 24:28.715
First, the hospital staff
will make it appear

24:28.750 --> 24:30.786
that you've succumbed to your injuries...

24:31.586 --> 24:34.388
Then you'll be transported
to the coroner's office.

24:34.422 --> 24:37.024
And then, as far as most
of the world is concerned,

24:37.058 --> 24:38.759
Todd Garlin...

24:38.793 --> 24:40.796
will be deceased.

24:42.730 --> 24:44.565
Congratulations, you're dead.

24:44.599 --> 24:46.199
Now, let's find out who killed you.

24:52.769 --> 24:54.536
It's been two days.

24:54.570 --> 24:56.405
I was really hoping not
to be dead by now.

24:56.439 --> 24:57.439
Dude, enjoy it.

24:57.473 --> 25:00.409
No bills, no responsibilities,
no spam callers.

25:00.443 --> 25:02.337
Have you finished analyzing the test?

25:02.338 --> 25:03.771
I'm still crunching the numbers.

25:03.806 --> 25:06.407
But I'll add impatience to the data set.

25:06.442 --> 25:09.577
A-Any thoughts so far,
any clues telling you who I am?

25:09.612 --> 25:12.614
I mean, you said all that stress
would bring out the real me.

25:12.648 --> 25:14.415
Sounds like it has.

25:16.352 --> 25:17.819
Hey.

25:17.853 --> 25:19.787
Is there any news?

25:19.822 --> 25:23.124
Yeah, the warrants came in
for the cell tower phone logs.

25:23.159 --> 25:24.926
Great, so we can cancel my funeral.

25:24.960 --> 25:26.628
Y-You know, Todd, it's this afternoon.

25:26.662 --> 25:29.470
We just... We need time
to search the logs.

25:30.299 --> 25:31.866
This is ridiculous.

25:31.901 --> 25:33.201
There wasn't even supposed
to be a funeral.

25:33.235 --> 25:34.402
Yeah, I-I-I'm sorry.

25:34.436 --> 25:36.437
You know, we didn't know Lisa's
friends would plan one.

25:36.472 --> 25:37.619
And we wanted to stop it,

25:37.653 --> 25:39.040
but it would have looked suspicious.

25:39.074 --> 25:41.509
After all I put her through,
I should be there.

25:41.544 --> 25:43.344
She knows it's not real.

25:43.379 --> 25:44.946
But it's gonna seem real to her.

25:44.980 --> 25:47.515
She'll be looking at my coffin,
mourning me,

25:47.550 --> 25:49.217
thinking next time
I'll actually be in there.

25:49.251 --> 25:50.852
Yeah, but right now, you're not in it.

25:50.886 --> 25:53.354
But that's my point. Even if
I was dead, I'd be there.

25:53.389 --> 25:56.457
I promised her I'd be there.

25:56.492 --> 25:58.999
I bet my killer's there, gloating.

25:59.562 --> 26:01.863
I just hate her having
to deal with this alone.

26:04.533 --> 26:05.566
What?

26:08.871 --> 26:10.405
I'm cousin Larry from Harrisburg.

26:10.439 --> 26:13.041
I'm cousin Larry from Harrisburg.

26:13.075 --> 26:15.843
Well, you're walking like Todd
from Los Angeles.

26:15.878 --> 26:17.178
I don't know how else to walk.

26:17.213 --> 26:19.847
You're an old man.
Imagine your knees hurt.

26:19.882 --> 26:21.649
What if I'm a spry old man.

26:21.684 --> 26:25.220
Okay, uh... How about this?

26:25.254 --> 26:27.422
I said your knees hurt,
not that you have to pee.

26:27.456 --> 26:28.723
All right, just forget it.
Just don't make eye contact.

26:28.757 --> 26:29.724
Don't mingle.

26:29.758 --> 26:32.694
And don't touch your beard
or it'll come off.

26:32.728 --> 26:35.396
Look, that's Jane from HR.
I thought she hated me.

26:35.431 --> 26:38.233
That's Lisa's friend Meg.
I know she hated me.

26:38.267 --> 26:40.235
Well, they're here, right?
So maybe they didn't.

26:40.269 --> 26:41.669
Maybe they're hate-mourning.

26:41.704 --> 26:44.105
By the way, this is
a surprisingly good turn-out.

26:44.139 --> 26:45.186
All right, look around.

26:45.221 --> 26:46.574
See if you see anyone out of the ordinary

26:46.609 --> 26:48.109
or shouldn't be here.

26:48.143 --> 26:49.577
Oh, my God.
- What?

26:49.612 --> 26:51.179
It's Dave and Marty.
My freshman roommates.

26:51.213 --> 26:53.581
No, no, no, Todd. You can't. You can't.

26:53.616 --> 26:55.283
He had his head in the sand.

26:55.317 --> 26:57.952
I can't remember a time
he wasn't working.

26:57.987 --> 27:00.121
Was a lucky guy, though.

27:00.155 --> 27:02.590
Lisa's a great- looking woman.

27:02.625 --> 27:04.592
Careful, Marty, you're not divorced yet.

27:04.627 --> 27:05.773
Do you hear that?

27:05.808 --> 27:07.061
I'm dead less than a week,

27:07.096 --> 27:09.130
and Marty's already trying
to bang my wife.

27:09.164 --> 27:10.732
All right, come on.
You can kick his ass later.

27:10.766 --> 27:13.468
Crowd looked bigger from
back there, didn't it?

27:13.502 --> 27:14.869
Todd?

27:14.903 --> 27:17.905
Oh, wow. I thought...

27:17.940 --> 27:21.109
You sound exactly like Todd.
You must be related.

27:21.143 --> 27:25.613
Uh, I'm Cousin Harris from Larryburg.

27:25.648 --> 27:27.582
This is my wife, uh... Pamela.

27:27.616 --> 27:28.650
Pamela. It's so nice to meet you.

27:28.684 --> 27:32.553
Cheryl Axelrod, CEO of MegaTech,
where Todd works.

27:32.588 --> 27:33.588
Worked.

27:33.622 --> 27:37.158
Sorry, it's just so hard
to believe he's gone.

27:37.192 --> 27:38.760
Well, I'm sure it would
mean a lot to Todd

27:38.794 --> 27:40.161
that you came to pay your respects.

27:40.195 --> 27:42.096
And I bet he'd be surprised as hell.

27:42.131 --> 27:43.729
Will you excuse us?

27:44.133 --> 27:46.401
I told you to <i>find</i> someone who stand out,

27:46.435 --> 27:47.635
not someone who stands out.

27:47.670 --> 27:49.337
You want something out of the ordinary?

27:49.371 --> 27:51.906
It's pretty weird that Axelrod
would be here.

27:51.940 --> 27:53.107
She hardly knew me.

27:53.142 --> 27:54.342
Well, maybe you meant more to the company

27:54.376 --> 27:55.910
than you thought.

27:58.547 --> 28:01.983
1,300 calls within a 5-second window

28:02.017 --> 28:03.518
on just one of these cell logs,

28:03.552 --> 28:05.520
and so far, none of these names
connect to Todd.

28:05.554 --> 28:07.322
So how's your dead guy doing?

28:07.356 --> 28:08.790
Uh, he's going a little stir crazy.

28:08.824 --> 28:10.425
Being dead is killing him.

28:10.459 --> 28:12.293
I faked my death once.

28:12.328 --> 28:14.495
Who were you running from? A gang.

28:14.530 --> 28:17.198
A girl. She wouldn't leave me alone.

28:17.232 --> 28:20.034
When I was, like, 14, this girl,
Khloe, was sweating me.

28:20.069 --> 28:21.669
So I had a friend of mine
tell her that I was dead.

28:21.704 --> 28:23.604
You literally ghosted her.

28:23.639 --> 28:26.274
Yeah, I guess I invented that.

28:26.308 --> 28:28.476
Baby Boy, order us a pizza.

28:28.510 --> 28:30.445
We could be here for a while.

28:30.479 --> 28:32.152
I told you not to call me that.

28:33.362 --> 28:35.530
I don't think we're gonna
need that pizza.

28:37.019 --> 28:38.867
Look where this call originated.

28:39.488 --> 28:42.056
And if he hadn't
pushed me into that tree,

28:42.091 --> 28:44.525
I would have drowned.

28:44.560 --> 28:48.696
So I not only have Todd
to thank for my life,

28:48.731 --> 28:50.465
but also for the metal plate in my leg

28:50.499 --> 28:51.777
since that fateful day...

28:55.003 --> 28:56.969
I really miss you, big bro.

28:57.773 --> 28:59.930
You always looked out for me.

29:00.676 --> 29:03.725
And I plan to return the favor tenfold.

29:05.214 --> 29:07.982
I promise to be completely there
for Lisa and the kids.

29:12.688 --> 29:13.921
Hey, cut it out.

29:13.956 --> 29:15.356
You'll smear the great
makeup job I did on you.

29:15.391 --> 29:17.572
Sorry. It's just very moving.

29:19.261 --> 29:21.329
Who's the pro-wrestler with Lisa?

29:21.363 --> 29:22.764
That's Walter Bunch,

29:22.798 --> 29:25.032
head of corporate security at MegaTech.

29:25.067 --> 29:26.915
We've never even spoken.

29:27.803 --> 29:30.473
What's the head of security
doing at your funeral?

29:30.507 --> 29:32.874
Wait, Todd... I mean, Larry.

29:35.811 --> 29:37.578
Lisa.

29:37.613 --> 29:39.514
Oh, my God.

29:39.548 --> 29:41.249
What are you doing here?
You're supposed to be dead.

29:41.283 --> 29:42.383
I had to come see you.

29:42.418 --> 29:44.385
I was worried about you, honey.
How you holding up?

29:44.420 --> 29:45.887
This is all so surreal.

29:45.921 --> 29:47.922
Lisa, the guy you were just
talking to from MegaTech.

29:47.956 --> 29:48.990
What did he say?

29:49.024 --> 29:51.626
Well, he acted like he was
offering his condolences,

29:51.660 --> 29:54.395
but I think he just wants
the company laptop

29:54.430 --> 29:56.230
and files from the house.

29:56.265 --> 29:58.566
He said you were working on
sensitive projects.

29:58.600 --> 30:01.736
And he was concerned
that I hadn't called him back.

30:01.770 --> 30:03.638
That is, like, the definition
of "too soon."

30:03.672 --> 30:06.073
Yeah, I thought so, too.

30:06.108 --> 30:10.311
Sorry.

30:12.014 --> 30:13.247
Hi, Eddie.

30:13.282 --> 30:15.483
Hey, I hear voices. Where are you?

30:15.517 --> 30:16.818
A-At the funeral.

30:16.852 --> 30:18.453
What? You're supposed <i>to be with Todd.</i>

30:18.487 --> 30:19.473
I am.

30:19.507 --> 30:21.222
<i>You took him to his own funeral?</i>

30:21.256 --> 30:22.957
What are you thinking?
You could blow his cover.

30:22.991 --> 30:24.792
Forget his cover. I blew the case open.

30:24.827 --> 30:26.327
Eddie, I got a lead.

30:26.361 --> 30:28.062
Yeah. Well, so do we.

30:28.096 --> 30:29.897
You know, the call
that triggered that bomb.

30:29.932 --> 30:32.800
It was made by someone
inside Todd's company.

30:32.835 --> 30:34.635
Yeah, someone who drives a black Escalade

30:34.670 --> 30:36.337
with tinted windows.

30:36.371 --> 30:38.111
I think I know who killed Todd.

30:38.980 --> 30:41.393
You really think Walter Bunch
tried to kill me?

30:41.423 --> 30:43.841
Lisa said it was definitely
his car outside your house.

30:43.884 --> 30:45.151
And the call that triggered that bomb

30:45.185 --> 30:47.553
was made from a cellphone
inside MegaTech.

30:48.038 --> 30:49.989
What exactly does Bunch do
at the company?

30:50.023 --> 30:51.524
He's Axelrod's hatchet man.

30:51.558 --> 30:53.593
He protects the company's interests.

30:53.627 --> 30:55.862
Well, apparently,
that included your laptop.

30:55.896 --> 30:57.430
What's on it?

30:57.464 --> 30:59.332
Same stuff that's on the servers.

30:59.366 --> 31:01.434
Normal work stuff.
I could log in and show you.

31:01.468 --> 31:03.002
Wait, wait. Don't use your real name.

31:03.036 --> 31:04.054
Remember, you're dead.

31:07.074 --> 31:09.742
Yeah, everything's there,
just the way I left it.

31:10.531 --> 31:13.480
Except... Wait, that's weird.

31:14.147 --> 31:16.015
Some of the reports I wrote are missing.

31:16.483 --> 31:18.217
What were they about?

31:18.252 --> 31:21.287
Major security flaw in
the MegaTech Smart Detector.

31:21.321 --> 31:23.289
It's a Wi-Fi-enabled smoke alarm.

31:23.323 --> 31:24.957
And what was the flaw?

31:24.992 --> 31:27.093
Uh, it can be hacked

31:27.127 --> 31:29.295
and turned into a listening device.

31:29.329 --> 31:30.963
I tested one by installing it
in my house.

31:30.998 --> 31:32.632
That's how I found out

31:32.666 --> 31:34.867
what my family really thought about me.

31:34.902 --> 31:36.068
That's awful.

31:36.103 --> 31:37.436
Yeah, it was.

31:37.471 --> 31:40.139
But my brother made me see it as a gift,

31:40.173 --> 31:42.241
a chance to fix things with
my family, to really...

31:42.276 --> 31:44.110
Wait, wait. Hold on, Todd.

31:44.144 --> 31:45.978
Let me get this straight,
you're saying that

31:46.013 --> 31:47.580
the smoke detector could be hacked

31:47.614 --> 31:49.415
and turned into an eavesdropping device?

31:49.449 --> 31:50.983
It was a huge problem.

31:51.018 --> 31:53.286
The company already sold
five million units.

31:53.320 --> 31:55.121
I sent my report to management.

31:55.155 --> 31:56.289
They said they were gonna fix it.

31:56.323 --> 31:58.824
And what would happen if
the news of that flaw got out?

31:58.859 --> 32:01.227
Well, the company would take a big hit.

32:01.261 --> 32:03.229
Stock price. PR.

32:03.263 --> 32:04.330
Heads would've rolled.

32:04.364 --> 32:06.332
Including the CEO's?

32:06.366 --> 32:07.996
Axelrod had been on thin ice for awhile.

32:08.030 --> 32:10.336
Something like this, the board
would've canned her for sure.

32:10.370 --> 32:11.971
Potentially costing her millions.

32:12.005 --> 32:13.272
That's why they were at the funeral,

32:13.307 --> 32:14.473
to close out the cover-up.

32:14.508 --> 32:16.642
Yeah, but I wasn't gonna tell anybody.

32:16.677 --> 32:18.678
Maybe they couldn't take that chance.

32:22.015 --> 32:25.151
Cheryl Axelrod.
I am such a huge fan, Ms. Swift.

32:25.185 --> 32:26.524
Oh, yes, I noticed.

32:26.559 --> 32:29.088
You've been following my posts
since "Hot Suspect."

32:29.122 --> 32:31.157
I hate to trade on that,
but it's the only way

32:31.191 --> 32:32.458
to get a meeting with such a busy woman.

32:32.492 --> 32:33.593
Are you kidding?

32:33.627 --> 32:36.462
When I heard Sam Swift wanted
to get inside the mind

32:36.496 --> 32:38.598
of a tech titan for an upcoming role,

32:38.632 --> 32:39.932
I was all in.

32:39.967 --> 32:41.867
So what's the movie?

32:41.902 --> 32:44.537
Oh, it's a thriller about
a corporate conspiracy,

32:44.571 --> 32:46.539
a cover-up, and a killing.

32:46.573 --> 32:48.641
Starring me and a smoke detector.

32:48.675 --> 32:50.343
What is this?

32:50.377 --> 32:52.478
This is a little chat about
Todd Garlin's murder.

32:52.512 --> 32:54.814
- I'm calling security.
- Walter Bunch?

32:54.848 --> 32:57.550
Because that would be great.
W-We want to talk to him, too.

32:57.584 --> 33:01.020
Why did you have Bunch
surveilling Todd's house?

33:01.054 --> 33:04.557
Are you suggesting MegaTech
is responsible for Todd's death?

33:04.591 --> 33:07.660
I mean, he realized
the smoke alarm was a wire tap.

33:08.136 --> 33:10.062
That created a problem.

33:10.097 --> 33:12.732
We fixed that problem
with a security patch.

33:12.766 --> 33:14.200
So why did you bury his report?

33:14.234 --> 33:17.136
Why'd you go after the laptop, the files?

33:17.562 --> 33:21.340
Because if word got out,
it would've been disastrous.

33:21.375 --> 33:24.377
So I'm guessing him dying was
just wildly convenient.

33:24.411 --> 33:28.080
Was the fact that Todd passed
away an advance to us? Yes.

33:28.115 --> 33:29.915
Did we kill him? No.

33:29.950 --> 33:32.218
We may be sons-of-bitches,
but we're not murderers.

33:32.252 --> 33:33.819
Well, someone here is,

33:33.854 --> 33:35.588
because the call that blew up his car

33:35.622 --> 33:38.691
was placed at 2:53 p.m. Thursday
from this building.

33:42.863 --> 33:44.430
Well, neither Mr. Bunch nor I

33:44.464 --> 33:45.774
were in the building at the time.

33:45.809 --> 33:47.366
Well, we need the security
footage from the lobby

33:47.401 --> 33:48.625
to see who came in when.

33:48.659 --> 33:50.936
We don't do cameras.
We have body scanners.

33:50.971 --> 33:54.273
Like, at the airport?
That makes you a naked ghost?

33:54.307 --> 33:55.841
We don't care about faces.

33:55.876 --> 33:57.777
Our system is designed to make sure

33:57.811 --> 33:59.879
people don't leave
with proprietary materials.

33:59.913 --> 34:01.280
We'll need to see the scans.

34:01.314 --> 34:03.382
Not without a warrant.

34:03.417 --> 34:07.420
Do you know how many followers
I have, Ms. Axelrod?

34:07.454 --> 34:09.188
How do you think they'll feel
about the MegaTech brand

34:09.222 --> 34:12.224
if I start posting everything I know?

34:14.594 --> 34:17.463
Next time I fly, I am opting
out of the body scanner.

34:17.496 --> 34:19.264
That is way more revealing
than I thought.

34:19.299 --> 34:20.533
I don't know how the hell
we're gonna ID anyone.

34:20.567 --> 34:22.400
I can't tell one person from another.

34:23.295 --> 34:25.404
Pretty sure that's a woman.

34:25.438 --> 34:27.306
Yep, and that's a dude.

34:27.340 --> 34:29.641
- Wow.
- I know, right?

34:29.676 --> 34:31.444
Wait, see that?

34:31.478 --> 34:32.311
What?

34:32.344 --> 34:33.480
It's a metal plate.

34:34.114 --> 34:35.981
Todd's brother Hugh told us a story

34:36.016 --> 34:37.382
about a metal plate in his leg.

34:37.417 --> 34:39.552
Something from an accident
when they were kids.

34:40.270 --> 34:41.786
Look at the time stamp.

34:41.822 --> 34:44.389
That's five minutes before
the bomb detonated.

34:44.424 --> 34:47.092
What if Hugh was trying
to kill his brother?

34:47.127 --> 34:48.994
And made the call from Todd's work

34:49.029 --> 34:50.518
to cover his tracks.

34:50.552 --> 34:52.898
That way, if anyone looked
to see where the call came from,

34:52.933 --> 34:54.900
it would point to someone
from his company.

34:54.935 --> 34:56.945
Why would Hugh want to kill his brother?

34:56.978 --> 35:00.139
I don't know,
but it can't be a coincidence.

35:00.173 --> 35:02.441
As far as Hugh's concerned,
Todd was dead.

35:02.476 --> 35:04.744
No, wait.

35:04.778 --> 35:07.847
Todd told Hugh about
overhearing this family.

35:07.881 --> 35:10.182
So Hugh knew about the smoke detector.

35:10.217 --> 35:12.818
And he told his wife about faking
Todd's death at Todd's house.

35:12.853 --> 35:14.353
Under the smoke detector.

35:14.387 --> 35:15.654
What if Hugh was listening?

35:15.689 --> 35:17.274
He would've known Todd's still alive.

35:19.192 --> 35:20.292
Todd's not answering.

35:26.333 --> 35:28.334
Todd! Where are you?!

35:28.368 --> 35:29.635
Sam!

35:37.652 --> 35:39.986
Someone tried to kill me? Again?

35:40.021 --> 35:42.537
Well, the good news is, the doctors say

35:42.562 --> 35:44.075
you're gonna make a full recovery.

35:44.100 --> 35:46.802
What was it this time? It was a gas leak.

35:46.836 --> 35:48.904
Still trying to figure out
where it came from.

35:48.938 --> 35:50.405
I know exactly where it came from.

35:50.440 --> 35:52.274
- Your furnace.
- No, that's brand-new.

35:52.308 --> 35:53.842
There's no way it was equipment failure.

35:53.876 --> 35:55.844
Of... Of course it wasn't.
I know that unit.

35:55.878 --> 35:58.380
It's Wi-Fi-enabled and very hackable.

35:58.414 --> 36:01.883
W-Wait a minute, who tried to kill me?

36:01.918 --> 36:03.318
Everyone thought I was dead.

36:03.352 --> 36:05.313
Not everyone.

36:05.755 --> 36:07.357
We think Hugh knew.

36:08.519 --> 36:10.826
Hugh? N-No. No.

36:10.860 --> 36:12.561
It's the way it's breaking, Todd.

36:12.595 --> 36:14.729
He's a science teacher.
He's got the technical know ho...

36:14.764 --> 36:17.532
You need to leave. Both of you.

36:17.567 --> 36:19.696
Look, I know how hard this is,

36:19.730 --> 36:21.937
but can you think of any reason
he might want to hurt you?

36:21.971 --> 36:23.495
Get the hell out!

36:41.224 --> 36:42.725
Lisa, you here?

36:44.160 --> 36:45.687
Got your text.

36:47.130 --> 36:49.898
Lisa didn't send you that text.

36:49.932 --> 36:51.276
I did.

36:52.001 --> 36:53.535
Todd.

36:55.274 --> 36:56.531
What the hell?

36:57.442 --> 36:58.476
What's going on?

36:58.510 --> 37:00.344
You tell me, Hugh.

37:00.379 --> 37:01.703
Why'd you do it?

37:05.784 --> 37:06.884
I want the truth.

37:13.692 --> 37:16.560
The truth, big bro,

37:16.595 --> 37:19.053
is that you've been a ghost
in your own life.

37:20.198 --> 37:21.699
Who was there to help Noah with math,

37:21.733 --> 37:23.334
or show Kyle how to throw a curve?

37:23.368 --> 37:25.269
You? No. You were too busy working.

37:25.304 --> 37:26.904
Who was there to console Lisa

37:26.939 --> 37:28.406
when she learned that you were gonna die?

37:28.440 --> 37:29.505
You? No.

37:29.539 --> 37:31.042
You were too consumed with your illness

37:31.076 --> 37:33.744
to actually be there
for your wife or your family.

37:33.779 --> 37:36.681
So, what? You were just gonna step in?

37:36.715 --> 37:39.750
I stepped in years ago.

37:39.785 --> 37:42.753
Did you ever ask yourself
why I never got married, Todd?

37:43.494 --> 37:45.456
Why I never found someone?

37:45.490 --> 37:49.026
Hmm? Because I knew Lisa
and the kids needed me.

37:49.061 --> 37:50.861
They're more my family
than they are yours

37:50.896 --> 37:53.197
- at this point.
- I don't understand.

37:53.231 --> 37:55.032
You were the one telling me
to fix things with them.

37:55.067 --> 37:57.034
I've been telling you that forever.

37:57.069 --> 37:58.803
But with all that's happened,
I finally get it this time.

37:58.837 --> 38:00.037
I understand. I'm changing.

38:00.072 --> 38:01.539
Please.

38:01.573 --> 38:03.441
I never heard that happening.

38:09.481 --> 38:12.817
What, you were eavesdropping?
On us? On me?

38:12.851 --> 38:15.319
You are who you are, Todd.
You'll never change.

38:15.354 --> 38:16.787
You don't know that.

38:16.822 --> 38:18.656
I've got a second chance
with Lisa and the kids.

38:18.690 --> 38:20.725
No, you dying was my second chance.

38:20.759 --> 38:23.394
- You'd kill your own brother?!
- You had cancer.

38:23.428 --> 38:25.329
You even hired a hitman
to finish you off.

38:25.364 --> 38:27.431
It was your time.

38:27.466 --> 38:28.899
Then, it was gonna be my time.

38:30.268 --> 38:32.636
And now you'll be doing time.

38:32.671 --> 38:35.106
Nothing like a little confession
to clear things up.

38:35.140 --> 38:38.609
Especially when it's streaming
live to the LAPD...

38:38.643 --> 38:40.277
Technology's a bitch, Hugh.

38:40.312 --> 38:42.179
Hugh Garlin,

38:42.214 --> 38:43.914
you're under arrest for attempted murder.

38:43.949 --> 38:45.449
Todd, y...

38:48.954 --> 38:50.645
You'll never change.

38:51.656 --> 38:53.924
Wanna bet?

38:55.527 --> 38:56.794
Come on.

39:05.670 --> 39:07.304
This is Detective Rollins' card.

39:07.339 --> 39:09.673
She wants to take your statement
when you have a moment.

39:09.708 --> 39:10.875
Hugh...

39:10.909 --> 39:12.877
Just so hard to believe.

39:12.911 --> 39:14.278
What's gonna happen to him?

39:14.312 --> 39:16.781
Well, he did try to kill you. Twice.

39:16.815 --> 39:17.982
Yeah, but he's still my brother.

39:18.016 --> 39:19.850
I don't want him to be in prison
for the rest of his life.

39:19.885 --> 39:21.719
Well, then, let
the district attorney know.

39:21.753 --> 39:22.820
They'll take that into account.

39:24.723 --> 39:27.625
So guess this is finally over?

39:27.659 --> 39:30.694
Or it's just beginning.
What's next for you?

39:30.977 --> 39:35.066
Well, I have 87 vacation days stored up.

39:35.100 --> 39:37.201
I thought, maybe, I'd take some time off.

39:37.235 --> 39:41.005
Lisa has always wanted to go
on a road trip with the kids.

39:41.039 --> 39:43.340
Rent an RV, see the Grand Canyon,

39:43.375 --> 39:45.376
go where the road takes us...
What do you think?

39:45.410 --> 39:47.078
I think that you've
identified the problem

39:47.112 --> 39:48.846
and know how to fix it.

39:50.371 --> 39:52.850
Todd. Good.

39:52.884 --> 39:55.419
I have your test results.
They're revealing.

39:55.454 --> 39:58.923
You know what, I'm good.

39:58.957 --> 40:01.158
I don't wanna know what the test says.

40:01.193 --> 40:03.761
That's not what the test says
you would say.

40:03.795 --> 40:05.362
It's okay.

40:05.397 --> 40:06.831
I know who I am.

40:08.366 --> 40:10.234
Thanks again. For everything.

40:14.372 --> 40:15.606
Wait!

40:15.640 --> 40:17.074
What's your diagnosis?

40:17.109 --> 40:18.900
That's confidential.

40:20.712 --> 40:22.612
I think he's gonna be okay.

40:34.993 --> 40:36.927
What are <i>you</i> doing here so early?

40:36.962 --> 40:38.729
Waiting for you.

40:38.763 --> 40:40.631
That sounds ominous.

40:40.665 --> 40:43.216
You know, spending all the time
with Todd got me thinking.

40:43.902 --> 40:45.903
The things we care about most in life,

40:45.937 --> 40:48.405
we sometimes let drift away.

40:48.440 --> 40:50.441
Oh, so it is ominous.

40:50.973 --> 40:52.910
Come into your office.

40:52.944 --> 40:54.979
I have something to show you.

41:02.687 --> 41:04.788
Well, that looks just like
my old long board.

41:04.823 --> 41:08.292
It <i>I</i> your old long board.

41:08.326 --> 41:11.262
That's, uh... That's impossible.

41:11.296 --> 41:14.205
I gave mine away to my neighbor
in Venice years ago.

41:15.033 --> 41:16.734
Yep, and he gave it to his son,

41:16.768 --> 41:18.502
who gave it to his girlfriend,

41:18.537 --> 41:22.106
who sold it to her drug dealer,
who put it in a barn.

41:22.140 --> 41:24.441
It's had quite the chain of custody.

41:29.347 --> 41:31.916
I'm amazed it's still in one piece.

41:31.950 --> 41:34.285
The surf shop cleaned it up,
said it's in great shape,

41:34.319 --> 41:35.853
very sea-worthy.

41:39.057 --> 41:41.158
It seemed like surfing
meant a lot to you.

41:41.193 --> 41:42.993
I just thought maybe...

41:43.028 --> 41:44.944
you might want to get back on the board.

41:45.997 --> 41:48.966
I'm on my way...

41:49.000 --> 41:50.134
What?

41:50.168 --> 41:51.669
I'm sorry. Did I do something bad?

41:51.703 --> 41:54.538
I really...
- No. No.

41:54.573 --> 41:55.872
It's, uh...

41:56.684 --> 41:57.741
It's great.

41:57.776 --> 42:01.512
It's great.

42:03.715 --> 42:05.983
You think you might go out?

42:06.017 --> 42:09.520
You know, uh, maybe I will...

42:09.554 --> 42:11.095
one of these days.

42:12.591 --> 42:14.491
Well, let me know when you do.

42:14.526 --> 42:16.976
You might get to see me in a bikini.

42:21.933 --> 42:24.535
Surf's up.
