Aurora Ganteng - Subscene

00:09.898 --> 00:10.622
Richard.

00:10.945 --> 00:11.577
Ashens.

00:12.685 --> 00:13.789
Well this is the place.

00:14.713 --> 00:15.521
You sure?

00:15.860 --> 00:17.683
Bet my left hairy bollock on it.

00:18.098 --> 00:22.091
Thanks, Richard, that's a mental picture I'll treasure.

00:22.532 --> 00:23.896
Come on.

00:30.358 --> 00:31.945
I'm looking for Iqbal.

00:31.945 --> 00:34.001
Who is looking?

00:34.001 --> 00:35.236
I am.

00:35.236 --> 00:37.093
I don't understand.

00:45.954 --> 00:50.907
We. The two of us. Are looking for Iqbal.

00:51.275 --> 00:52.964
Where is he?

00:52.964 --> 00:54.312
Oh, why didn't you just say so?

00:54.312 --> 00:56.603
No need to get your knickers in a tit.

00:56.680 --> 00:58.865
He's in the back.

00:59.835 --> 01:01.349
Oh, no, you wait here.

01:01.349 --> 01:02.473
Again?!

01:02.473 --> 01:03.721
Why'd you bring me?

01:03.721 --> 01:05.689
You keep an eye on things, yeah?

01:05.733 --> 01:06.904
Fine.

01:19.883 --> 01:20.997
Are you Iqbal?

01:23.719 --> 01:25.095
You know why I'm here?

01:25.336 --> 01:28.635
Your very attractive friend tells me you're in the market for a Q-Mutt 17.

01:28.635 --> 01:30.161
Correct.

01:30.161 --> 01:31.175
Do you even know what that is?

01:31.175 --> 01:37.933
The Q-Mutt 17 is a rip-off of the Dancing Digidog, the most popular Christmas toy of 2002.

01:37.933 --> 01:41.933
It looks exactly the same as the real device, it was a quarter of the price,

01:41.933 --> 01:46.215
and rather than dancing, it simply emitted a series of loud beeps,

01:46.215 --> 01:48.141
and then fell over.

01:48.141 --> 01:49.721
Very impressive.

01:51.859 --> 01:53.190
So, can I see it then?

01:53.411 --> 01:55.342
Yeah. You may.

02:01.935 --> 02:02.971
Well can I see it then?!

02:03.018 --> 02:04.172
Alright mate, calm down!

02:04.172 --> 02:05.576
No need to get your knickers in a tit!

02:05.576 --> 02:07.082
What does that mean?

02:08.112 --> 02:09.388
Don't you worry.

02:23.400 --> 02:25.341
Who's your mama?!

02:25.632 --> 02:27.649
You are! Mummy!

02:27.992 --> 02:29.820
Why does she always need the reassurance?

02:31.591 --> 02:34.388
You guarantee that this is a rip-off Q-Mutt 17?

02:34.722 --> 02:35.640
Course!

02:35.640 --> 02:38.541
Look, do you want it or not? I've got ten buyers lined up, alright?!

02:38.793 --> 02:40.674
This tail is translucent.

02:40.674 --> 02:42.395
So? So what?!

02:42.395 --> 02:44.453
The Q-Mutt 17 had an opaque tail.

02:44.601 --> 02:47.420
This, is a genuine Digidog!

02:47.664 --> 02:49.314
You know nothin'!

02:49.320 --> 02:51.095
Oh, I think I do.

02:54.835 --> 02:58.881
The pain is indescribable!

03:00.870 --> 03:04.415
It's just water, mate. I was thirsty earlier on.

03:04.926 --> 03:09.156
Oh, sorry, I thought 'cause of the whole context, it was horrible chemicals or something.

03:09.156 --> 03:12.002
Oh, I can understand why you thought that, I mean, yeah, definitely tap water.

03:12.002 --> 03:14.293
Not filtered, but it's tap water.

03:18.904 --> 03:19.786
Do you want a towel?

03:19.786 --> 03:22.642
A towel, that'd be great, cheers man, I didn't see that there.

03:25.635 --> 03:27.626
Richard! Richard, he making a run for it!

03:27.626 --> 03:29.091
Cut him off in the alley!

03:29.091 --> 03:30.665
I'm on it!

03:30.665 --> 03:33.024
Sorry! I have to go!

03:33.484 --> 03:35.084
Remember me?

03:40.574 --> 03:42.486
Wait! My Facebook!

04:00.556 --> 04:01.825
Ugh! Not you!

04:01.825 --> 04:05.894
You always were a bit slow, weren't you, Rashens?

04:07.666 --> 04:08.814
Idiot!

04:21.387 --> 04:23.550
You were supposed to head that guy off!

04:23.550 --> 04:27.084
It turns out, that sniveling little turd, Nemesis was behind it all.

04:27.387 --> 04:28.950
I'm in the pub!

04:28.950 --> 04:29.673
Richard?

04:35.828 --> 04:37.683
This is why I work alone!

05:12.162 --> 05:15.462
# Nobody plays the game better,

05:16.127 --> 05:19.373
# But no one could play it much worse.

05:19.599 --> 05:23.145
# You alone know these rules to the letter,

05:23.404 --> 05:27.274
# And they spell out your mission, and curse.

05:27.518 --> 05:31.145
# Obsolete hardware from years ago,

05:31.393 --> 05:34.989
# Finding it all is your aim.

05:35.133 --> 05:38.628
# From thriftstores to eBay to Antique Roadshows,

05:38.958 --> 05:42.870
# Adventure is your favourite game.

05:42.128 --> 05:49.297
# Oh, and Ashens is your name.

05:54.011 --> 06:01.543
# But where will this lead in the end? For no man is an island of tat.

06:01.925 --> 06:08.705
# Perhaps what you need is a friend, could you imagine that?

06:09.449 --> 06:16.701
# Your mission's about to begin, if you don't lose then you might just win.

06:17.407 --> 06:22.827
# We're routing for you, you odd little bearded prat!

06:25.487 --> 06:28.849
# Terrible hardware from years gone by,

06:29.237 --> 06:32.793
# Worthless old relics, you claim.

06:32.883 --> 06:36.337
# There's one left to get now, don't give in and cry.

06:36.713 --> 06:39.816
# Adventure is your favourite game.

06:39.869 --> 06:46.893
# Oh, and Ashens is your name.

06:48.148 --> 06:50.400
# Or, is it Ashen?

06:50.874 --> 06:53.226
# I'm confused about the 'S'.

06:53.844 --> 06:56.101
# Ashen...s.

06:56.237 --> 06:58.933
# Ashen... uh... s.

07:55.840 --> 07:57.513
Hah! Stuart!

07:58.332 --> 07:59.424
Stuart!

07:59.737 --> 08:01.102
Sorry, do I know you?

08:01.102 --> 08:02.015
It's me.

08:04.821 --> 08:05.685
It's Chef.

08:05.817 --> 08:06.723
Chef... What?

08:07.376 --> 08:08.482
Oh my God... Geoff?

08:08.482 --> 08:09.481
Geoffrey Excellence?

08:09.481 --> 08:10.777
I didn't recognise you!

08:10.777 --> 08:11.523
Yeah...

08:11.523 --> 08:16.510
I didn't know you were back in town, and dressed as a chef.

08:16.821 --> 08:18.300
But I am a chef!

08:18.764 --> 08:20.008
I'm Chef Excellence.

08:20.008 --> 08:24.041
Oh yeah! You're the mascot for that uh, Kid's food line, weren't you?

08:24.041 --> 08:26.780
Yeah... Did you ever see any of my stuff?

08:27.374 --> 08:30.781
A bowl for you... Oh yes, and obviously one for you, honey.

08:30.781 --> 08:32.251
There you go, kiddies.

08:32.251 --> 08:35.303
What's wrong? Why you not eat food?

08:35.611 --> 08:37.880
Good kiddies, eat your food!

08:37.880 --> 08:39.900
If you do not, then Chef will be pretty sad.

08:39.900 --> 08:41.910
And when Chef gets sad.

08:44.771 --> 08:46.572
Chef get angry.

08:46.572 --> 08:48.379
Chef get angry!

08:48.379 --> 08:52.769
Angry! He gets so angry!!!

08:52.769 --> 08:58.485
Eat your food, kids! Eat it all up!!!

09:00.382 --> 09:02.501
Eat your food, please. For Chef.

09:05.416 --> 09:09.514
Very, very angry! Eat your food! Eat your food.

09:09.683 --> 09:11.572
Yeah, alright mate, calm down.

09:11.572 --> 09:14.306
I'm going to grab a bite to eat, so it was lovely to see you again... Yeah?

09:14.306 --> 09:16.924
I know a great place.

09:16.924 --> 09:19.951
Fine.

09:25.849 --> 09:27.068
When did you move back?

09:27.068 --> 09:29.292
A few months ago, I lost my job.

09:29.292 --> 09:32.551
If you lost your job, why are you dressed as a chef?

09:32.979 --> 09:37.516
I'll always be a chef. A true chef, is a chef regardless of his employment status.

09:38.112 --> 09:39.720
Fair enough.

09:39.720 --> 09:43.530
I loved that job. I had a company car in the shape of a baguette.

09:43.530 --> 09:46.106
The ladies loved it.

09:47.214 --> 09:49.092
Then they went and replaced me with...

09:51.978 --> 09:55.980
Ooh... Calm down, there. You were the Ronald McDonald of cheap italian food. I get it.

09:55.980 --> 09:57.731
Oh right, Stuart!

09:57.731 --> 09:59.600
I've seen the stuff you do on YouTube you know.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.454
Reviewing bits of tat on a brown sofa.

10:01.454 --> 10:03.490
It's not exactly The Matrix, is it?

10:03.490 --> 10:04.943
Maybe the Third one...

10:04.943 --> 10:07.359
See, Geoff?
This is exactly why we don't-

10:08.624 --> 10:12.011
Look um, it's getting late, I've got loads of stuff to do. Nice to see you again.

10:12.712 --> 10:15.072
Are you going? I mean... w-w-w... Do you live around here?

10:15.072 --> 10:17.761
Umm... Yeah, yeah, just up near the park.

10:17.761 --> 10:19.040
Anyway, see you later.

10:40.311 --> 10:41.691
Geoff?

10:42.032 --> 10:43.930
Hey!

10:44.132 --> 10:45.555
How's it going?

10:45.555 --> 10:47.262
You don't have anywhere to sleep, do you?

10:47.262 --> 10:49.018
What?!

10:49.850 --> 10:50.981
Please can I stay with you?

10:51.240 --> 10:54.919
Uhh... I'm not really a "come and stay on my sofa" kind of guy.

10:55.035 --> 10:56.571
Oh, come on Stuart!

10:56.571 --> 10:58.139
Please, just for old times sake. Please!

10:58.139 --> 11:00.059
Ple-ple-ple-ple-ple-please! Please!!!

11:00.059 --> 11:01.726
Please let me stay with you!!!

11:01.726 --> 11:04.293
Okay! Okay, but it's just for one night, yeah?

11:04.470 --> 11:06.081
Just for one night. Just one night.

11:06.081 --> 11:07.089
Come on.

11:08.766 --> 11:10.794
I have one question.

11:10.794 --> 11:14.049
Why were you there, when you had that right next to you?

11:18.739 --> 11:19.708
Don't judge me!

11:27.186 --> 11:29.813
Come on! Come on, you're letting all the heat out.

11:29.994 --> 11:32.182
There's heat?!

11:32.307 --> 11:34.251
I'll give you the tour.

11:35.195 --> 11:36.972
This is the living room.

11:37.684 --> 11:40.298
Wow! You sure do have a lot of crap.

11:40.298 --> 11:42.301
Yes, I do!

11:42.301 --> 11:45.374
Don't touch anything though, I like things a particular way.

11:45.673 --> 11:46.779
You won't even notice I'm here.

11:46.779 --> 11:47.588
Good.

11:47.650 --> 11:49.401
Come on, I'll show you the rest of the house.

11:50.247 --> 11:54.200
Okay, sink's here. There's the cooker. That's the fridge, obviously.

11:54.677 --> 11:56.082
Dining room is through here.

11:56.420 --> 11:57.872
You've seen the living room of course.

11:58.454 --> 11:59.721
What's in here?

11:59.940 --> 12:01.841
That's just a room I use for storage, don't worry about that.

12:01.841 --> 12:03.269
Oh... It's locked.

12:03.269 --> 12:04.419
Can I have a look?

12:04.419 --> 12:06.081
Oh no, no I just remembered I've lost the key.

12:06.081 --> 12:07.211
Let's get you sorted-

12:07.211 --> 12:08.331
Why is it locked?

12:08.331 --> 12:09.286
Just leave it alone! You're going to damage something.

12:09.286 --> 12:10.761
There's no reason for you to go in there.

12:10.761 --> 12:12.611
C'mon Stu, why is this locked?!!

12:15.825 --> 12:17.069
Oh, wow!

12:19.087 --> 12:21.798
No! Don't go down there!

12:25.533 --> 12:26.973
Come on, Geoff!

12:41.267 --> 12:42.460
Hello?

12:42.460 --> 12:44.272
Yeah, hi. It's Stuart from next door.

12:44.272 --> 12:47.343
Could you keep it down a bit please? I've got somebody over.

12:47.343 --> 12:49.471
Oh, sorry, I must have got carried away.

12:49.471 --> 12:50.981
Yeah, thanks, bye.

12:52.024 --> 12:54.459
It's my neighbour. He's a bit of a weirdo.

12:54.459 --> 12:57.421
Some kind of improvisational jazz musician or something.

12:57.421 --> 12:59.276
You never see him without his costume on.

12:59.568 --> 13:00.952
Weirdo.

13:03.541 --> 13:05.703
Come on, Geoff. Nobody is allowed in here.

13:06.716 --> 13:08.755
What is all this stuff, is this all the tat you've reviewed?

13:08.755 --> 13:14.715
No. No. This is something... Different.

13:15.192 --> 13:16.492
What is it?

13:16.673 --> 13:18.322
There's something you don't know about me,

13:18.322 --> 13:20.584
something very few people know.

13:22.153 --> 13:23.620
I'm a collector.

13:23.620 --> 13:27.963
I collect very rare, but absolutely worthless collectibles.

13:28.202 --> 13:30.505
That's so cool!

13:41.204 --> 13:42.459
What's this?

13:42.459 --> 13:44.046
It's nothing!

13:44.046 --> 13:45.875
What is it?

13:46.094 --> 13:48.787
Look, it's a long and boring story, and I'm tired.

13:49.409 --> 13:50.797
Come on, Stu.

13:51.002 --> 13:52.276
What's the Game Child?

13:52.532 --> 13:57.381
It's the one thing I have always desired, and never gotten hold of.

13:57.381 --> 14:00.350
That's very cryptic, Stu, but not very helpful.

14:00.629 --> 14:05.623
The Game Child is a rip-off of the first popular handheld games console.

14:05.623 --> 14:09.250
It was the first of its type, and to my knowledge, the only one.

14:09.250 --> 14:13.821
It was released around 1989, but only put out in very small numbers.

14:13.821 --> 14:15.336
But aren't those rip-off games everywhere?

14:15.336 --> 14:17.116
Usually.

14:17.486 --> 14:19.294
Do you really want to know?

14:20.421 --> 14:22.562
Ok, I'll start from the beginning.

14:24.599 --> 14:29.372
It was a different, more simple time.

14:29.932 --> 14:33.652
You have to remember, these were the very early days of handheld consoles.

14:34.493 --> 14:37.456
We knew that the Game Child was being released, but nobody knew where.

14:38.050 --> 14:40.228
However, my sources gave me a lead.

14:43.069 --> 14:44.644
Oh hey! Mashens!

14:44.943 --> 14:46.008
Stashens!

14:46.008 --> 14:47.078
Gashens!

14:47.078 --> 14:48.295
Fashens!

14:48.680 --> 14:51.436
Yes, I get it, Nemesis! God, you're a right pain in the arse!

14:51.695 --> 14:54.067
A right pain in your mum's arse!

14:54.620 --> 14:55.562
Guess where I'm going?

14:55.562 --> 14:56.079
Don't care.

14:56.079 --> 14:56.583
Guess.

14:56.583 --> 14:56.912
Don't care.

14:56.912 --> 14:57.522
Guess!

14:57.522 --> 14:57.992
Still don't care.

14:57.992 --> 14:58.548
Guess!!!

14:58.548 --> 14:59.868
Your weekly rectal exam.

15:00.158 --> 15:02.223
No! That's Thursday!

15:02.698 --> 15:05.153
I'm going to go buy the only Game Child in Norwich!

15:06.293 --> 15:08.660
Oh, that's where you're going, isn't it Stuart?

15:09.196 --> 15:11.163
You thought you were the only one who knew.

15:11.664 --> 15:13.676
Yeah well you're not getting this one first, you little git!

15:27.327 --> 15:28.281
Hey, Nemesis!

15:28.281 --> 15:29.995
It's 'Nee Mah Si' you idiot!

15:31.167 --> 15:32.736
Hey! Stuart, Stuart, Stuart!

15:32.736 --> 15:34.130
Where are you going?

15:34.130 --> 15:35.770
Sorry Geoff, I'm in the middle of something.

15:35.770 --> 15:38.189
Wait, do you want to try some of this, it's my own recipe?

15:38.442 --> 15:40.329
It's a Pakistani and Italian blend.

15:40.329 --> 15:41.616
Oh, no time! No time!

15:41.616 --> 15:42.525
Can I come with you?

15:42.525 --> 15:44.009
Not this time.

15:44.009 --> 15:45.030
Stuart!

16:08.658 --> 16:11.865
That's it. That little prat got the Game Child, and I didn't.

16:12.320 --> 16:15.787
Wow... And in all that time, you've not be able to come across another Game Child?

16:17.211 --> 16:18.272
No, I haven't.

16:18.427 --> 16:21.015
But I thought you were some sort of super collector of collectibles...

16:21.015 --> 16:23.587
Well it doesn't mean I can magic one out of thin air, does it?!

16:23.772 --> 16:25.789
Oh, I'm sorry. Okay.

16:26.125 --> 16:28.100
Look, there is more to the story than that.

16:29.993 --> 16:32.122
There was a total recall on the product.

16:32.246 --> 16:34.866
Turned out it was frying kids eyes, and burning their fingers.

16:35.233 --> 16:36.229
Oh, God!

16:36.821 --> 16:39.392
Only two hundred were sold, and do you want to know the weird thing?

16:39.890 --> 16:42.628
The company refunded more money than they were actually sold for.

16:43.111 --> 16:44.638
Even Nemesis handed his in.

16:45.176 --> 16:51.500
And it was the Terrifically Good Company... Your Terrifically Good Company, who issued the refunds.

16:51.500 --> 16:53.263
There's nothing 'terrific' or 'good' about them, Stuart.

16:54.982 --> 16:59.956
I've heard rumours that there's one still out there, but I've never been able to track it down.

17:00.065 --> 17:01.974
So there's a Game Child out there?

17:02.412 --> 17:04.526
Maybe. I don't know.

17:04.526 --> 17:06.651
Come on, you've got to be a bit curious, right?!

17:06.651 --> 17:09.451
I mean, look at all this stuff!

17:09.451 --> 17:12.170
You've got to be the best collector of collectibles.

17:12.170 --> 17:13.929
I'm sure you can find it.

17:13.929 --> 17:16.171
We could find it. It could be our quest!

17:16.171 --> 17:17.412
Our what?

17:17.412 --> 17:19.118
A quest, you know, a long arduous search for something,

17:19.118 --> 17:22.285
a kind of journey, to an ultimate goal.

17:22.285 --> 17:24.936
I know what a quest is, Doctor Thesaurus!

17:24.936 --> 17:26.746
But I'm not interested in going on one.

17:26.746 --> 17:27.848
Come on, it could be fun!

17:27.848 --> 17:28.913
Come on!

17:28.913 --> 17:29.784
No.

17:30.137 --> 17:31.501
I'm tired now.

17:31.516 --> 17:33.432
You can sleep in the back room.

17:34.215 --> 17:35.635
Stuart.

17:46.921 --> 17:48.135
Woah!

17:48.213 --> 17:49.235
Bloody Hell!

18:03.880 --> 18:06.112
Now then, Stuart. I'm gonna tell you something.

18:06.859 --> 18:08.485
Y'see this door, here?

18:08.485 --> 18:12.161
You're gonna have a ball of a time.

18:13.651 --> 18:15.348
Bloody sofa is talking to me again!

18:20.159 --> 18:20.743
What the?

18:24.860 --> 18:26.329
Argh! I'm no good at dodging these!

18:26.329 --> 18:28.565
Only the cool kids were allowed to be in goal!

18:31.661 --> 18:34.554
Oh, come on! This is unlikely at best!

18:48.231 --> 18:50.154
Oh great! Electricity.

18:59.706 --> 19:02.144
Woah...

19:06.694 --> 19:09.073
Sorry, what was that? I can't quite hear you.

19:14.356 --> 19:16.899
Do what? Could you speak up a bit?

19:16.899 --> 19:20.336
I said find the Game Child! You deaf git!

19:20.336 --> 19:22.876
Oh, right! Find the Game Child.

19:23.407 --> 19:26.556
Find the Game Child! It is your destiny.

19:26.556 --> 19:28.337
But where do I find it?!

19:28.337 --> 19:31.246
You know what you have to do.

19:31.246 --> 19:32.871
A little help would be good.

19:32.871 --> 19:35.688
Figure it out yourself, you lazy bastard!

19:37.190 --> 19:38.537
Oh, ow!

19:38.537 --> 19:40.216
That's starting to hurt now!

19:40.216 --> 19:42.170
Oh right, That's getting very painful now!!!

19:42.170 --> 19:44.495
Argh!!!

19:49.338 --> 19:50.975
Well that was bloody obvious, wasn't it?!

19:51.513 --> 19:53.710
There's nothing worse than a preachy claymation!

19:58.873 --> 19:59.805
Morning, Stu.

20:01.066 --> 20:02.413
Whatcha doing?

20:02.721 --> 20:04.267
I'm going on a trip.

20:04.450 --> 20:05.136
Where?

20:05.351 --> 20:06.796
To find the Game Child.

20:06.858 --> 20:07.533
A quest!

20:07.533 --> 20:08.956
It's not a quest!

20:08.956 --> 20:10.310
Okay, fine! Where do we begin?

20:10.814 --> 20:12.527
Not 'we', 'me'.

20:12.527 --> 20:14.139
But it was my idea!

20:14.139 --> 20:15.526
Yeah, well I work alone!

20:15.526 --> 20:16.778
Ooh I work alone!

20:16.778 --> 20:17.849
That's stupid!

20:17.849 --> 20:19.377
No it's not. You're stupid.

20:19.377 --> 20:20.574
You see?

20:20.574 --> 20:22.897
You say I haven't changed! You haven't changed either.

20:22.897 --> 20:25.256
Ooh, Mr. Secretive! "Oh don't touch my things!"

20:25.256 --> 20:26.953
"Everything's so precious!"

20:26.953 --> 20:29.475
Would it really kill you to let me join you?

20:30.398 --> 20:33.248
Okay, you can come, but don't slow me down, yeah?

20:33.840 --> 20:35.685
Oh great! Oh, this is going to be so good!

20:35.685 --> 20:37.237
This is going to be amazing!

20:38.985 --> 20:40.486
What are you wearing?!

20:41.844 --> 20:43.887
Well... Well you know... Uh...

20:43.887 --> 20:45.156
There's a time and place...

20:45.156 --> 20:48.621
You know I l- It's one of- You know what it's like- You never been-

20:51.116 --> 20:52.603
It keeps me warm!!!

20:55.110 --> 20:57.765
Go and get ready! And change out of that!

21:04.903 --> 21:06.424
Hi, Ashens!

21:07.066 --> 21:08.423
Hey, fella, I'm Richard.

21:08.423 --> 21:11.095
It's nice to meet you! I'm Chef Excellence!

21:11.095 --> 21:12.412
Fair enough...

21:12.412 --> 21:14.205
Well, it looks like we're going on another mission.

21:14.205 --> 21:15.118
Well, I am.

21:15.118 --> 21:16.503
Great! What are we tracking down?!

21:17.009 --> 21:19.146
Sorry, Richard. I'm doing this one alone.

21:19.935 --> 21:21.891
Well, Geoff here is going to tag along.

21:21.891 --> 21:23.554
W-w-why can't I go?!

21:23.554 --> 21:25.983
Because you've let me down too many times!

21:25.983 --> 21:28.820
I'm sorry, Stuart, I'll make it up to you!

21:28.820 --> 21:30.664
Maybe next time, eh?

21:31.833 --> 21:32.975
Sorry, buddy.

21:54.115 --> 21:55.239
So, where are we heading, Stuart?

21:55.489 --> 21:59.430
To see my old professor from uni, and he is not going to be happy to see me.

21:59.430 --> 22:01.149
Why?

22:01.149 --> 22:03.060
It's complicated.

22:03.060 --> 22:05.035
That's not very helpful, Stuart, what happened?

22:06.296 --> 22:08.519
I left his research team in the middle of a big project.

22:08.519 --> 22:09.829
Why?

22:09.829 --> 22:11.859
It was to do with my girlfriend at the time.

22:38.074 --> 22:38.879
Alright?

22:39.239 --> 22:41.283
Hey, Stu, let me handle this.

22:41.283 --> 22:43.965
A true Chef is a master of all communication.

22:46.545 --> 22:48.007
You alright there, my good man?

22:53.244 --> 22:54.664
Let me handle this.

23:23.757 --> 23:25.316
I didn't know you could speak Klingon.

23:25.624 --> 23:27.225
Go and find us somewhere to sit, yeah?

23:33.585 --> 23:34.620
'Scuse me.

23:36.208 --> 23:37.799
Pint of whatever's cheapest, please.

23:39.461 --> 23:40.233
Hi.

23:40.233 --> 23:41.094
Hello.

23:41.433 --> 23:43.257
So, uhh... Nice spoon you've got there.

23:43.257 --> 23:46.158
I'm trying to bend it, with my mind!

23:46.558 --> 23:47.071
You try.

23:47.202 --> 23:48.861
Oh, no, I'm alright, mate.

23:50.383 --> 23:51.651
Do not try to bend the spoon.

23:51.866 --> 23:52.983
But you said to bend the spoon.

23:52.983 --> 23:57.813
To bend the spoon is impossible. Only try to realise the truth.

23:57.813 --> 23:59.938
That there is no spoon.

23:59.938 --> 24:02.098
There is a spoon, you just gave it to me. I've got it right here.

24:02.098 --> 24:04.337
The spoon only exists in your mind!

24:04.337 --> 24:05.749
No, it exists in my hand! Look!

24:06.290 --> 24:07.280
Physically real spoon.

24:07.280 --> 24:08.734
It does not exist!

24:09.008 --> 24:09.498
Right!

24:09.729 --> 24:10.934
Peanuts on the spoon!

24:11.050 --> 24:11.756
Peanuts are real.

24:12.796 --> 24:13.886
But the spoon? No, sir.

24:13.886 --> 24:16.041
Yes! So what, are they floating in the air?

24:16.085 --> 24:16.745
No...

24:16.755 --> 24:18.086
Are they floaty-peanuts?

24:18.086 --> 24:19.062
It's a bloody spoon! It's in my hand

24:19.062 --> 24:19.953
It's not real!

24:19.953 --> 24:21.182
This is clearly a spoon, look!

24:21.182 --> 24:22.061
It's not real!

24:22.061 --> 24:23.183
Spoon! Spoon! Spoon!

24:23.183 --> 24:25.154
Lalalalalalala!

24:25.154 --> 24:25.773
There!

24:26.923 --> 24:27.853
See?!

24:28.597 --> 24:31.867
Cheers.

24:32.901 --> 24:34.726
I wish people would stop doing that to me.

24:35.710 --> 24:36.999
So, what was that about over there?

24:36.999 --> 24:41.008
Don't know, just some guy who's really confused about the existence of cutlery.

24:41.008 --> 24:43.277
Ah...

24:43.277 --> 24:45.305
So, how can this professor help us on our quest?

24:53.435 --> 24:55.284
He's the most brilliant man I've ever known.

24:56.173 --> 24:58.313
And he's as obsessed with the Game Child as I am.

24:59.576 --> 25:00.195
Oh.

25:06.247 --> 25:06.908
Ready?

25:07.631 --> 25:11.041
Stay here, yeah?

25:09.535 --> 25:10.831
Oh w-w-wait.

25:11.334 --> 25:12.490
Let me come with you, Stu.

25:12.659 --> 25:13.941
Come on, don't leave me out here.

25:14.205 --> 25:15.365
Not with...

25:16.181 --> 25:16.965
Spoon Boy...

25:17.865 --> 25:19.277
I mean, look at him!

25:21.012 --> 25:22.523
No, it's better that I go alone.

25:23.579 --> 25:24.345
Grab yourself a pint of something.

25:41.717 --> 25:43.344
Stuart Ashen.

25:44.641 --> 25:45.372
Professor.

25:45.624 --> 25:46.775
It's been a while.

25:47.317 --> 25:49.375
You've got a nerve, showing up here.

25:49.471 --> 25:51.685
Well I'm here, so surely we can forget about all that.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.914
You ruined me, Ashens!

25:54.914 --> 25:57.857
I ruined you?! You're the one who had sex with my girlfriend!

25:57.857 --> 26:01.687
You're still upset about that?! That was years ago!

26:01.687 --> 26:03.548
You hold a grudge, don't you?!

26:03.548 --> 26:06.389
She was just using me, if that's any consolation!

26:06.389 --> 26:08.178
No, it isn't!

26:08.178 --> 26:11.397
You were my lecturer, and you slept with the only girl I ever cared about!

26:11.397 --> 26:13.964
Okay, okay, point taken!

26:13.964 --> 26:16.554
You didn't have to tell the vice-chancellor!

26:16.554 --> 26:18.453
Not this again! I didn't tell anybody!

26:19.013 --> 26:22.398
Everything fell apart after you left.

26:22.398 --> 26:25.171
A year later I was thrown out of the university.

26:26.661 --> 26:28.672
So what do you want, Stuart?!

26:39.501 --> 26:39.911
Yes!

26:40.420 --> 26:41.206
Another!

26:54.244 --> 26:57.473
You're not still looking for the Game Child, after all these years?!

26:57.693 --> 26:58.923
Do you know where it is?

26:59.117 --> 27:00.185
I might.

27:00.727 --> 27:04.454
But, you'd have to prove yourself worthy of this quest!

27:04.717 --> 27:07.834
It's not a quest, I'm just looking for an old video game system!

27:08.065 --> 27:13.666
That was always one of your failings. You could never see the big picture.

27:14.429 --> 27:15.553
What do I have to do?

27:16.490 --> 27:18.192
You must pass the test.

27:18.962 --> 27:20.162
What is this test?

27:20.413 --> 27:25.967
You must beat me at the most intensive game of skill and wits ever devised by the human mind.

27:28.971 --> 27:30.012
Space Attack!

27:30.689 --> 27:31.603
Is that all?

27:31.829 --> 27:34.631
I'll have you know I am a very formidable opponent!

27:34.631 --> 27:35.628
Yeah.

27:35.628 --> 27:40.664
And I was Norfolk Space Attack Champion 1985, 1986, 87, and 89.

27:41.305 --> 27:43.918
88 was cancelled, due to illness.

27:45.070 --> 27:46.571
You can do it! You can do it!

27:46.571 --> 27:47.906
The spoon doesn't exist!

27:47.906 --> 27:50.196
It doesn't exist! It's not real!

27:50.196 --> 27:52.290
You can bend it with your mind!

27:52.290 --> 27:53.238
Do it!

27:59.218 --> 28:01.071
Push yourself! Bend the spoon!

28:01.075 --> 28:02.297
Come on! Come on!

28:07.967 --> 28:08.624
Yes!

28:08.624 --> 28:09.436
One-Nil to me!

28:09.908 --> 28:10.568
Boom!

28:10.568 --> 28:11.279
Hah!

28:11.279 --> 28:12.153
Oh, sod this!

28:12.892 --> 28:13.870
Where's the Game Child?!

28:14.092 --> 28:14.696
Ow! Stop it!

28:14.875 --> 28:15.605
Tell me.

28:15.675 --> 28:16.035
Ow!

28:16.663 --> 28:18.033
Yes! Yes!

28:19.047 --> 28:20.067
Oh my God!

28:20.324 --> 28:20.825
What's that?

28:21.092 --> 28:22.589
What am I looking at, where?!

28:24.630 --> 28:25.195
Yes!!!

28:25.745 --> 28:27.417
The spoon doesn't exist!

28:27.679 --> 28:28.583
It doesn't exist!

28:28.886 --> 28:30.004
I told you all!

28:30.743 --> 28:31.486
I know.

28:32.466 --> 28:33.062
I know!

28:33.671 --> 28:34.321
Dicks!

28:34.823 --> 28:38.343
Tell me!

28:35.439 --> 28:36.076
Tell me!

28:36.466 --> 28:37.747
Alright, alright! I'll tell you!

28:38.515 --> 28:40.384
You and your bloody quest!

28:40.590 --> 28:41.996
It's not a quest!

28:41.996 --> 28:46.154
Look, I don't know where the Game Child is.

28:47.054 --> 28:47.626
But!

28:48.716 --> 28:51.646
I can help you, on your journey.

28:50.776 --> 28:54.503
First, you must find the Oracle.

28:54.679 --> 28:56.857
That's the best you can do?!

28:57.429 --> 28:59.103
Oh, and there's this.

29:03.368 --> 29:07.149
Abadgh...

29:07.980 --> 29:09.431
Is that a place in Wales?

29:09.622 --> 29:11.042
I've never followed it up.

29:11.784 --> 29:13.769
Why couldn't you have just told me this in the first place.

29:14.340 --> 29:16.557
Uhh... Just a bit lonely back here.

29:18.850 --> 29:21.288
Do you uhh... Do you ever see her?

29:21.456 --> 29:22.259
Who?

29:22.537 --> 29:23.860
Your ex. Ashley.

29:23.999 --> 29:25.792
No, I haven't seen her since she dumped me.

29:26.129 --> 29:26.938
Why?

29:27.140 --> 29:28.936
As I said, very lonely.

29:30.860 --> 29:35.230
You know, I've never really apologised to you for what I did.

29:35.230 --> 29:36.527
No, you didn't.

29:37.427 --> 29:38.534
No, I didn't.

29:40.454 --> 29:41.843
And you still haven't.

29:42.107 --> 29:43.243
Oh right...

29:45.328 --> 29:46.258
Look, Stuart...

29:46.258 --> 29:51.044
I really am sorry, I hope you can forgive me.

29:53.567 --> 29:55.117
It's been good to see you again, professor.

29:55.484 --> 29:56.244
Good luck.

29:56.303 --> 29:57.108
Thanks.

30:15.004 --> 30:15.770
Stuart?

30:15.770 --> 30:16.614
Stuart!

30:16.614 --> 30:18.145
Stuart! Hey!

30:20.619 --> 30:21.439
I bent a spoon!

30:21.824 --> 30:23.654
With my frickin' mind, man!

30:24.591 --> 30:25.288
Good for you-

30:25.288 --> 30:25.891
With my mind!

30:25.891 --> 30:27.050
Good for you.

30:27.050 --> 30:29.661
Now, let's go. Put your hand around here...

30:30.058 --> 30:31.481
You should have took me with you.

30:31.481 --> 30:32.689
Get off the chair, come on.

30:32.689 --> 30:34.292
I could have helped!

30:34.965 --> 30:36.368
You're almost as bad as Richard!

30:36.840 --> 30:37.345
Who?!

30:38.076 --> 30:39.210
Who's Richard?!

30:53.853 --> 30:54.533
Hi there.

30:54.940 --> 30:56.766
My name, of course, is Chef Brilliance!

30:56.766 --> 31:00.430
And everything I make is, well, brilliant.

31:00.430 --> 31:02.996
I'm here to tell you about my brand new food for kiddies.

31:03.297 --> 31:05.275
Made by me, Chef Brilliance.

31:05.275 --> 31:09.708
Now just take a look at what you've been putting into your kids mouths.

31:09.708 --> 31:11.961
Eurgh.

31:11.961 --> 31:15.740
Now, did you know, that the more colourful your food is, the better it is?

31:16.571 --> 31:19.977
And all I have to do, is sprinkle a little bit of brilliance on it.

31:21.607 --> 31:23.679
That's why my brand new range only comes in colour.

31:23.679 --> 31:28.243
And that's what we, at the Terrifically Good Company, call Terrifically Good Food.

31:28.496 --> 31:32.256
Chef Brilliance's almost lasagne-like food products.

31:33.049 --> 31:34.185
Only in colour.

31:38.698 --> 31:40.149
What's the matter?

31:40.397 --> 31:41.403
I don't want to talk about it.

31:41.940 --> 31:43.405
That's fine, I respect your privacy.

31:46.405 --> 31:47.734
Get off my back, man!

31:47.734 --> 31:49.346
Shut up, and listen.

31:50.956 --> 31:52.166
I miss my job.

31:52.370 --> 31:53.612
What happened?

31:53.612 --> 31:56.204
I thought they were encouraging kids to eat more healthily,

31:56.204 --> 32:00.413
but then one night I was working late, and I wandered into the lab.

32:03.543 --> 32:06.078
One of the things I loved most about my job was that I was helping kids,

32:06.086 --> 32:08.647
and I thought all the foods being made were all natural, and organic,

32:08.728 --> 32:09.648
but I learned otherwise.

32:13.281 --> 32:14.269
What I saw in the lab...

32:16.114 --> 32:16.970
What I saw...

32:18.221 --> 32:19.274
It was unspeakable!

32:57.149 --> 32:59.187
I confronted them the next day, and they fired me on the spot.

32:59.602 --> 33:01.795
That's when they replaced me with...

33:01.795 --> 33:05.069
That's when they replaced me with Chef Brilliance!

33:05.483 --> 33:07.934
He's taken everything from me.

33:07.934 --> 33:09.072
Everything!

33:10.351 --> 33:15.038
I'd do anything to get my job back!

33:17.973 --> 33:22.004
There, there. Everything is going to be fine.

33:23.890 --> 33:26.464
Thanks, Stuart. You know, you're a really good friend.

33:30.672 --> 33:31.401
So, anyway...

33:31.912 --> 33:32.551
Yeah.

33:33.059 --> 33:34.159
Who's the Oracle?

33:34.637 --> 33:36.032
I don't know. That's what I'm trying to work out.

33:39.834 --> 33:42.302
"The answer is more obvious than you think"...

33:43.495 --> 33:44.021
What does that mean?

33:52.043 --> 33:52.540
What is it?

33:53.334 --> 33:54.340
Come on. Let's go.

33:59.225 --> 34:01.631
Oh, it's Ashens again.

34:01.631 --> 34:02.377
Hello, Stuart?

34:02.909 --> 34:04.048
Hello? Hello?!

34:04.844 --> 34:06.365
Ashens, you're arse-dialling me!

34:06.984 --> 34:08.266
Oh, that is so annoying!

34:09.393 --> 34:12.382
Now, where was I, he's totally interrupted my creative flow.

34:15.216 --> 34:19.415
Don't look behind us, I think we're being followed.

34:19.415 --> 34:19.665
Why are you wearing orange?!

34:21.094 --> 34:22.344
It's the only one they had at the store.

34:22.344 --> 34:23.780
I told you do wear black!

34:24.286 --> 34:24.954
Who would be following us?

34:25.376 --> 34:26.844
A right pain in my arse.

34:28.025 --> 34:29.789
On the count of three, we make a run for it.

34:29.789 --> 34:31.161
Wait, one, two and three?

34:31.588 --> 34:32.737
Or, one, two... and-

34:33.266 --> 34:34.012
Just run!

34:34.393 --> 34:35.725
I can't run, I've got asthma!

34:43.946 --> 34:44.547
Who was that?!

34:45.097 --> 34:46.341
I'll tell you later. Let's go.

34:56.949 --> 34:58.632
Stuart? Stuart.

34:59.089 --> 34:59.888
Where are we?

35:00.268 --> 35:01.619
It'd be nice to be included once in a while.

35:04.973 --> 35:05.802
Read this.

35:07.014 --> 35:09.810
"The Oracle Computer"... What is it?

35:10.266 --> 35:13.334
It's something that just happens to be in this very building.

35:13.799 --> 35:14.625
What is this place?

35:16.184 --> 35:16.970
It's a library.

35:17.321 --> 35:19.546
A library?! Wow!

35:26.241 --> 35:30.241
Stuart.

35:27.398 --> 35:28.232
Hi, Marian.

35:30.241 --> 35:30.904
It's been a while.

35:31.807 --> 35:34.363
Yeah... Yeah, sorry about that... I've been busy.

35:34.833 --> 35:35.893
Hmm... Let me guess.

35:35.893 --> 35:40.118
You've been busy with your "secret missions", that "must be undertaken alone."?

35:40.598 --> 35:43.562
Or is it "I'm an island!"? Or... I've got one for you...

35:44.126 --> 35:47.541
"I'm too stupid to know when I've got a really good thing going on!"?

35:48.013 --> 35:49.820
Uh, yeah... Something like that.

35:50.462 --> 35:51.743
This is Geoff.

35:51.743 --> 35:52.480
Have you met Geoff?

35:52.737 --> 35:53.493
Hello!

35:53.767 --> 35:54.486
Hello Geoff.

36:01.636 --> 36:04.157
This is really awkward!

36:04.775 --> 36:06.797
Marian, I said I'm sorry.

36:07.658 --> 36:09.894
Is there any chance we can get back into the archives?

36:10.385 --> 36:11.797
Not a chance!

36:12.232 --> 36:13.511
You know you're not allowed back there.

36:13.992 --> 36:14.684
Please?

36:15.254 --> 36:16.973
Plus, they've just installed a new security system.

36:17.670 --> 36:19.158
It'd be the last time. I promise.

36:21.188 --> 36:22.590
Why do you keep coming back here, Stuart?

36:24.489 --> 36:26.201
Yeah! Why do you keep on coming back here?!

36:27.778 --> 36:28.905
I don't understand you.

36:30.156 --> 36:33.185
Fine, but don't let anyone see you.

36:33.723 --> 36:35.224
Thanks Marian, I owe you one.

36:35.625 --> 36:36.630
You owe me more than one!

36:39.691 --> 36:41.024
Stuart, what was all that about?

36:42.355 --> 36:43.193
It's a long story.

36:45.178 --> 36:46.722
What's with all the big secrets?!

36:47.898 --> 36:52.429
Look, we went out on a couple of dates, but you know, my life's very complicated so umm...

36:52.867 --> 36:55.524
Stuart, life is only as complicated as you make it.

36:55.524 --> 36:57.799
Yes... Thanks Socrates!

36:57.997 --> 36:58.745
Come on.

37:03.591 --> 37:06.385
You know, Stuart, I really like it back here.

37:06.992 --> 37:10.010
Yeah, I like to think of it as the bowels of the library.

37:10.643 --> 37:11.662
This would be the lower intestine.

37:12.209 --> 37:14.710
Ah, well if this is the lower intestine, what does that make us?

37:17.809 --> 37:19.530
Euuuurgh!

37:19.530 --> 37:20.169
Let's go.

37:23.989 --> 37:26.279
I have no memory of this place!!!

37:26.503 --> 37:27.466
Oh, we're not lost are we?!

37:28.308 --> 37:29.840
Oh, no, it's just down here.

37:30.254 --> 37:31.393
Sorry, I don't know what I was thinking then.

37:43.844 --> 37:45.549
I don't know where we are.

37:47.805 --> 37:48.901
Maybe we should follow this sign.

37:58.217 --> 38:00.053
It's got to be through here somewhere.

38:04.432 --> 38:05.144
Hey, Geoff...

38:05.164 --> 38:05.945
Help us with this.

38:09.225 --> 38:09.912
Careful...

38:13.474 --> 38:14.343
Oh, a door!

38:15.030 --> 38:16.313
Yeah, a locked door...

38:16.403 --> 38:17.965
Hang on, I can take care of this...

38:21.295 --> 38:23.413
No, I can't, it's magnetically sealed.

38:24.978 --> 38:26.595
There's got to be a trigger around here somewhere.

38:27.076 --> 38:28.078
Well, what does the trigger look like?

38:28.349 --> 38:29.628
I'll know it when I see it.

38:35.773 --> 38:37.188
Well, this shouldn't be here.

38:43.365 --> 38:46.572
I reckon these are musical notes.

38:47.004 --> 38:48.226
Thank you, Professor.

38:50.357 --> 38:50.910
Something happened!

38:51.179 --> 38:51.949
That's good, Stuart...

38:52.976 --> 38:54.293
I don't think we have much time though.

38:56.480 --> 38:57.340
Argh!

38:58.406 --> 38:59.459
Umm...

38:59.870 --> 39:02.080
Oh God, right... Uhh...

39:03.107 --> 39:03.511
That's it!

39:07.291 --> 39:09.825
Oh, I wish I paid more attention in piano lessons.

39:10.567 --> 39:11.057
Uhh...

39:14.605 --> 39:15.528
There's no such note as "H"!

39:15.528 --> 39:16.458
What says "H"?!

39:30.933 --> 39:31.696
Oh... Thank God.

39:31.903 --> 39:34.357
See, that is why our Council Tax is so high!

39:34.744 --> 39:35.633
I thought we were going to die.

39:36.947 --> 39:40.168
Right! Well, Geoff. Meet the Oracle.

39:40.552 --> 39:42.217
Oh wow!

39:43.627 --> 39:45.649
It looks like total crap!

39:45.792 --> 39:49.730
Early '80s Z80 compatible, with proprietary serial buffer.

39:50.271 --> 39:52.482
Used as a localised teletext server.

39:53.217 --> 39:56.440
Stuart, some of the stuff you know is so inspiring!

39:57.212 --> 39:59.361
Or really... Really depressing!

40:00.988 --> 40:02.696
So, this shouldn't be too hard to access, then.

40:03.595 --> 40:06.066
Oi! Shift over!

40:06.513 --> 40:08.795
I'll find the back door. I always find the back door.

40:08.795 --> 40:10.300
Yeah, I've heard the rumours! Look, just shift!

40:10.674 --> 40:12.561
No! You shift!

40:19.269 --> 40:20.521
What is going on?!

40:21.277 --> 40:23.726
Half the bloody floor is missing out there!

40:23.901 --> 40:25.568
Oh, yeah! Sorry about that.

40:26.009 --> 40:27.715
I want you out! Now!

40:28.187 --> 40:29.961
Come on, Marian, we only just got in!

40:29.961 --> 40:32.364
The floor's already collapsed, so it's not going to get any worse.

40:33.794 --> 40:34.652
Okay, you can stay.

40:34.652 --> 40:36.533
On one condition.

40:36.928 --> 40:39.533
You have to let me join you on this mission.

40:40.400 --> 40:41.062
Oh... No.

40:41.535 --> 40:42.536
That's not a good idea.

40:42.536 --> 40:43.637
It'd be really boring.

40:43.872 --> 40:47.039
Stuart, I get about 3 people a month in here.

40:47.039 --> 40:49.630
Anything you're doing has to be more exciting than that!

40:49.840 --> 40:52.926
Come on, Stuart!!! Let her join us, it'll be great!!!

40:53.388 --> 40:54.549
Come on, we could do with the company!

40:55.031 --> 40:56.988
We'd be like The Three Musketeers!

40:56.988 --> 40:59.320
Except, you know, they were guys, and, you know...

40:59.320 --> 41:01.999
You're obviously a lady...

41:01.999 --> 41:04.374
A very, very lovely lady.

41:04.739 --> 41:06.040
Well, thank you, Geoff.

41:06.040 --> 41:07.115
That's enough of that!

41:07.520 --> 41:10.594
Fine, you can come, but don't slow us down, yeah?

41:10.926 --> 41:12.410
I won't! I promise!

41:12.605 --> 41:14.510
Right, do you need help with the password?

41:14.510 --> 41:15.822
No, of course not!

41:17.282 --> 41:18.393
Aren't you a clever boy?!

41:19.551 --> 41:22.343
Right. Time to find the Game Child.

41:27.761 --> 41:28.774
Oh...

41:29.437 --> 41:30.443
It looks like a map...

41:30.443 --> 41:33.363
But, what use is a map without any place names?

41:33.752 --> 41:35.033
I'll print it anyway.

41:36.419 --> 41:37.479
Come on, let's go!

41:37.680 --> 41:38.519
Yes!

41:41.465 --> 41:42.150
I've got it!

41:42.150 --> 41:43.377
Right, are we ready to go?!

41:44.005 --> 41:44.789
Yeah... I think that's it.

41:45.145 --> 41:46.312
Okay, I just need to lock up!

41:46.755 --> 41:47.903
Ooh, we're going on a little adventure!

41:47.903 --> 41:49.021
This is going to be so much fun!

41:52.394 --> 41:53.817
Come on, let's go!

41:53.817 --> 41:54.444
Let's go!

41:54.444 --> 41:55.017
What are you doing?!

41:55.526 --> 41:56.384
What about Marian?!

41:56.848 --> 41:57.288
What are we doing?

41:57.288 --> 41:58.248
Come on!

41:58.672 --> 41:59.779
She's still in there!

42:00.156 --> 42:01.466
I know, come on!

42:05.628 --> 42:09.380
Stupid! Stuart... Ashens...

42:10.294 --> 42:12.620
Ashens.... Ass Head!

42:13.290 --> 42:16.211
Stupid name, with his stupid YouTube channel.

42:16.522 --> 42:18.926
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

42:20.127 --> 42:23.073
Oh... Hello, sorry we're closed.

42:23.992 --> 42:27.319
We're not here to take out any books... You idiot.

42:27.319 --> 42:31.638
You know what? I've had a really horrible day, and you're very annoying.

42:31.970 --> 42:33.174
So leave.

42:36.838 --> 42:40.050
I was just telling your friend. We're closed. Now get out!

42:41.520 --> 42:42.275
Oh, we'll go...

42:43.035 --> 42:44.755
But you'll be joining us.

42:44.755 --> 42:48.779
What are you talking about?!

42:47.075 --> 42:49.442
Get off of me!

42:54.032 --> 42:56.017
We shouldn't have done that, Stuart, she seemed treally nice!

42:56.456 --> 42:59.371
She is, she is really nice.

42:59.371 --> 43:02.224
I just don't want to get her mixed up in this insanity.

43:02.224 --> 43:03.654
I knew it! You like her, don't you?

43:03.847 --> 43:04.430
You like her!

43:04.430 --> 43:07.087
# Ashens and Marian sitting in a tree...

43:07.087 --> 43:09.196
# K-I-S-S-I-N-G

43:09.196 --> 43:10.137
# F-U-

43:10.137 --> 43:10.797
Yeah! Alright!!!

43:10.797 --> 43:11.747
That's enough of that!

43:11.916 --> 43:14.076
So what's the problem? She obviously likes you!

43:14.076 --> 43:15.469
I don't want to talk about it.

43:15.469 --> 43:17.139
Oh, come on, Stuart, don't be like that.

43:17.621 --> 43:18.821
I like to keep my life simple.

43:18.821 --> 43:19.912
I'm not accountable to anybody else.

43:19.912 --> 43:21.455
Nobody is accountable to me.

43:21.455 --> 43:24.296
Otherwise things get messy.

43:24.296 --> 43:26.064
Oh, God, that is ridiculous!

43:26.064 --> 43:27.992
You're not an island, Stuart.

43:28.394 --> 43:30.957
# "No man is an island".

43:30.957 --> 43:31.852
Well it works for me.

43:31.852 --> 43:32.652
I don't think it does.

43:32.652 --> 43:33.618
Just drop it, yeah?

43:33.618 --> 43:36.152
Come on, Captain Unaccountable, what are you avoiding?

43:36.152 --> 43:37.310
Geoff. Enough.

43:37.807 --> 43:38.654
Ooh, what's the matter with you?

43:38.654 --> 43:41.569
Fine! Alright, you really want to know?

43:41.569 --> 43:42.550
Of course I do.

43:43.356 --> 43:47.701
Well, at school I was the weird kid, who knew all the answers,

43:47.701 --> 43:50.132
and was obsessed with tat, and you know...

43:50.132 --> 43:53.441
That's not really a recipe for popularity or friends...

43:54.030 --> 43:57.225
Then at university I thought I'd found somewhere I fit in, but...

43:57.225 --> 44:00.641
Then the Professor went and... Well...

44:00.641 --> 44:02.529
You know that story.

44:03.301 --> 44:06.206
Whenever I get close to people I get hurt.

44:07.991 --> 44:09.462
I was your friend at school.

44:11.752 --> 44:13.203
Yeah... Yeah, you were.

44:13.474 --> 44:15.241
Well, has it been that horrible having me about?

44:15.763 --> 44:19.883
Yes, it's been the worst thing that's ever happened to me in my entire life!

44:20.492 --> 44:21.524
Geoff's right, Ashens.

44:21.524 --> 44:23.614
You can't keep shutting people out forever.

44:24.395 --> 44:25.748
It makes for a very lonely life.

44:26.238 --> 44:27.591
Trust me, I know.

44:27.987 --> 44:28.478
Exactly.

44:28.880 --> 44:29.757
See, that's what I've been trying to tell him.

44:29.757 --> 44:30.725
He just doesn't listen.

44:31.153 --> 44:33.100
A life without risk is a life half-lived.

44:34.334 --> 44:36.146
Do you mind? This is a private conversation.

44:36.874 --> 44:37.838
I'm sorry.

44:39.791 --> 44:40.522
So where are we heading?

44:40.810 --> 44:42.660
Well, I know someone who would help us with the map.

44:43.089 --> 44:46.533
It's just that he's in a secure psychiatric facility.

44:46.533 --> 44:47.483
Seriously?!

44:47.667 --> 44:50.053
Are none of your acquaintances not total nutjobs?!

45:10.829 --> 45:11.996
Let me do the talking...

45:12.565 --> 45:14.398
I've got a fake I.D. Card.

45:15.402 --> 45:15.998
Okay.

45:19.283 --> 45:19.861
Hello, Wesley.

45:21.375 --> 45:22.304
Nice to see you again.

45:29.214 --> 45:31.114
Lovely weather we're having for this time of year...

45:32.275 --> 45:35.376
Nice for this month, on average... Umm...

45:39.653 --> 45:40.935
You've got ten minutes

45:45.539 --> 45:46.157
Hello!

45:53.160 --> 45:55.993
I can smell your thoughts!

45:56.598 --> 45:57.145
Eurgh!

46:16.963 --> 46:18.168
Oh! Hello there!

46:18.705 --> 46:19.437
How's it going?!

46:19.802 --> 46:20.449
I'm fine, cheers!

46:20.449 --> 46:21.093
How's you?

46:21.305 --> 46:24.285
I'm not too bad, considering I've been in here for several years for no good reason!

46:24.629 --> 46:28.884
You killed seventeen people because they beat your high score at Donkey Kong, Larry.

46:28.884 --> 46:30.953
Well... There's that...

46:31.759 --> 46:32.563
Who's your mate?

46:32.920 --> 46:33.873
I'm Chef Excellence!

46:34.231 --> 46:36.085
Well you want to be careful about going on adventures with him!

46:36.292 --> 46:38.312
Last time I was with him, I lost one of my fingers.

46:38.689 --> 46:39.825
But you've got five fingers!

46:39.825 --> 46:40.705
I had six!

46:40.705 --> 46:41.747
It's true...

46:42.207 --> 46:43.698
Look, we need some information.

46:43.698 --> 46:44.741
Anything you want, mate.

46:44.741 --> 46:45.878
About the Game Child.

46:45.878 --> 46:46.990
Anything except that, mate.

46:51.129 --> 46:54.054
Look, can you just have a look at this map, and tell us what place it is?

46:57.397 --> 46:59.021
I've told you about the Game Child before.

46:59.375 --> 47:00.385
I'm not telling you.

47:01.384 --> 47:02.709
Please! It's really important.

47:02.709 --> 47:04.212
-Oi! This I.D. Card's a fake!!!

47:04.365 --> 47:05.016
Run!

47:05.016 --> 47:06.004
It's in Sadonion!

47:06.503 --> 47:06.985
Run!

47:10.156 --> 47:11.080
Ashens?

47:13.655 --> 47:14.815
Sadonion...

47:15.361 --> 47:16.861
I know where that place is.

47:18.090 --> 47:19.364
Oh, damn it, Ashens!

47:20.744 --> 47:23.373
I had better go and find him,
otherwise he'll be calling me with his arse all day!

47:28.196 --> 47:28.757
Argh!

47:34.744 --> 47:35.199
Geoff?

47:36.619 --> 47:37.241
Geoff?

47:38.015 --> 47:38.696
Geoff!

47:54.969 --> 47:55.963
Geoff! Geoff!

47:55.963 --> 47:58.307
Over here, mate!
Where have you been?

47:58.307 --> 47:59.633
I got lost for a second.

48:00.304 --> 48:01.341
I was really worried.

48:01.341 --> 48:02.384
I'm fine.

48:02.384 --> 48:03.866
I just got sidetracked.

48:03.866 --> 48:05.214
I thought you'd been captured or something!

48:06.164 --> 48:07.356
Yeah, you would have loved that, wouldn't you?

48:07.356 --> 48:09.273
What? What are you talking about?

48:09.565 --> 48:12.989
Admit it. You don't want me on this mission, and you have never wanted me around!

48:12.989 --> 48:14.205
No! That's not true!

48:14.205 --> 48:14.983
It is true!

48:15.632 --> 48:16.501
You'll just ditch me.

48:16.501 --> 48:18.595
Just like everyone else has my entire life.

48:18.807 --> 48:22.853
Look, I don't know what's gotten into you, but I should have left you in there with all the other lunatics!

48:22.853 --> 48:25.345
Yeah...You're right...

48:27.875 --> 48:29.636
I'm not right, am I?

48:29.933 --> 48:32.805
At least you're not wearing that Chef's hat anymore.

48:33.447 --> 48:34.279
Come on, let's go.

48:42.757 --> 48:43.951
Stuart Ashen!!!

48:43.951 --> 48:45.140
Bloody hell!

48:45.546 --> 48:46.632
What are you doing here?!

48:46.632 --> 48:48.746
You've been arse-dialling me all day!!!

48:48.746 --> 48:49.728
Oh...

48:49.728 --> 48:50.798
Oh, sorry, I didn't realise!

48:50.798 --> 48:52.317
Yes, it was quite annoying,

48:52.317 --> 48:55.229
but it gives me the opportunity to apologise to you in person.

48:55.229 --> 48:59.548
I appreciate that my music may have been a trifle too loud, and for this, I am sorry.

48:59.548 --> 49:02.567
It's alright. Yeah. Um... This is my friend, Geoff.

49:02.567 --> 49:05.201
Hey! Great costume!

49:05.201 --> 49:06.303
It's not a costume!

49:06.816 --> 49:07.408
Weirdo.

49:07.913 --> 49:12.647
Anyway, I overheard your situation, and I have a necessary experience to help you on your quest.

49:12.647 --> 49:14.291
It's not a quest. It's a mission.

49:14.291 --> 49:17.373
Yeah whatever. I shall lead you to Sadonion.

49:17.373 --> 49:18.625
We're going to walk to Sadonion?

49:18.625 --> 49:21.518
One does not simply walk into Sadonion.

49:21.681 --> 49:22.742
Come with me.

49:33.139 --> 49:34.422
Stuart, I'm scared!

49:34.422 --> 49:38.450
I think I went to a hotel like this place.

49:36.075 --> 49:37.225
I want to turn back!

49:37.225 --> 49:38.523
It's not good.

49:41.379 --> 49:44.064
I swore I would never return to this place..

49:47.386 --> 49:51.035
So, you have returned, Champion of the Shining Death's Head!

49:52.166 --> 49:55.272
The nightmares beyond this fog all still hold much danger for thee.

49:56.226 --> 49:57.635
Ashens. Come with me.

50:02.604 --> 50:03.575
What happened here?

50:07.285 --> 50:10.886
The creatures beyond this wall have never proffered an explanation.

50:11.763 --> 50:15.644
And those that have sought one have found only madness!

50:16.236 --> 50:17.754
I bet the house prices are cheap, though.

50:18.152 --> 50:20.125
Eh... Not if you want a place by the seafront.

50:24.520 --> 50:25.724
You don't want to mess around in there.

50:26.045 --> 50:29.911
This will stop most of the horrors, but probably won't help me against the tentacle-headed things.

50:30.481 --> 50:31.546
But, what are you going to do?

50:33.494 --> 50:34.430
Can't be too careful.

50:34.703 --> 50:36.985
I can't let you do this. This is my mission.

50:36.985 --> 50:38.761
You would never survive in that place.

50:39.082 --> 50:41.171
Come on, Stu. Let someone help you for once.

50:42.592 --> 50:43.846
Okay. Okay.

50:43.944 --> 50:44.830
Good Luck.

50:44.947 --> 50:45.783
Thank you.

50:47.920 --> 50:49.506
Do not cross the fog wall!

50:49.966 --> 50:51.587
The Silver Skull will return!

51:02.723 --> 51:04.550
The Silver Skull forgot his lunch box.

51:05.648 --> 51:06.373
What?!

51:06.412 --> 51:07.446
Right, back in a minute.

51:17.145 --> 51:18.215
What the hell was that?!

51:18.215 --> 51:19.805
I don't know, man.

51:20.503 --> 51:23.388
Did you make the stick yourself? Or eBay?

51:24.359 --> 51:28.135
So do you guys wait here all day? Do you have somewhere to go, like, in the evening when it gets a bit cold?

51:39.384 --> 51:43.748
Are you in a union, or something? Or a civil partnership?

51:51.457 --> 51:52.503
You alright? Come on!

51:52.842 --> 51:53.631
You're alright, mate, I've got you!

51:53.816 --> 51:55.359
Come on. Come on.

51:56.845 --> 51:58.100
Oh...

52:00.155 --> 52:03.170
The tentacle-headed things. There were too many.

52:04.081 --> 52:04.815
I'm sorry.

52:04.815 --> 52:07.759
Help me take this mask off.

52:08.979 --> 52:10.704
Let me look on you with-

52:10.704 --> 52:12.319
With your own eyes. Yes.

52:12.319 --> 52:14.690
I'm dying here! I can quote whatever I like!

52:14.690 --> 52:15.790
Sorry! Sorry!

52:22.321 --> 52:22.571
But...

52:23.341 --> 52:26.080
You're quite obviously the famous actor, Warwick Davis!

52:26.413 --> 52:30.630
Yes. You may remember me from the Star Wars and Harry Potter franchises,

52:30.630 --> 52:32.841
as well as the 1988 fantasy film, Willow.

52:33.221 --> 52:34.684
But how can you be the Silver Skull?

52:34.928 --> 52:37.025
I just put this mask on. It's not rocket science!

52:37.426 --> 52:38.384
But, you're the wrong height!

52:38.384 --> 52:40.487
You don't have to be a certain height to wear a mask, you know!

52:40.812 --> 52:42.844
No, I meant, the Silver Skull is tall, isn't he?

52:42.881 --> 52:44.781
I'm an actor. It's called acting.

52:44.781 --> 52:46.861
I mean, it's like a, a matter of physics, isn't it?

52:46.861 --> 52:50.567
Oh, so now I have to be 5 foot 7 to understand the basic principles of science, now?

52:50.567 --> 52:52.103
No, that's not what I meant at all!

52:52.452 --> 52:54.713
Crestfallen guy! Help me out, here.

52:56.063 --> 52:58.859
You know what you are?! You're an idiot! And a bigot!

53:02.066 --> 53:03.561
You've got the wrong end of the stick!

53:04.989 --> 53:05.711
I got you!

53:06.161 --> 53:06.669
What?!

53:06.725 --> 53:07.795
I was just pulling your leg!

53:07.960 --> 53:09.245
I thought it up with that guy, over there.

53:14.058 --> 53:15.052
Unbelievable!

53:15.254 --> 53:16.221
So you're not really dying then?

53:16.221 --> 53:17.195
No! I'm fine!

53:17.561 --> 53:18.863
And you're not Warwick Davis.

53:18.863 --> 53:20.166
I'm quite clearly Warwick Davis.

53:20.166 --> 53:21.914
Oh... Right. Right.

53:23.125 --> 53:24.127
Here, give me a hand up.

53:28.197 --> 53:30.436
But.... Oh forget it.

53:31.972 --> 53:32.622
See you later!

53:34.698 --> 53:35.403
Weirdos...

53:36.183 --> 53:37.197
Hi. I'm Stuart.

53:37.635 --> 53:38.223
Who are you?

53:38.223 --> 53:40.591
Hey, dude, they call me the Guide.

53:40.591 --> 53:44.184
So, presumably, you guide people places?

53:44.184 --> 53:46.933
Yeah, man, that's pretty much it in a nutshell.

53:47.347 --> 53:51.602
Look, you have saved my life, and I am in your debt.

53:51.602 --> 53:55.364
The Silver Skull told me of your quest to find the Game Child.

53:55.826 --> 53:57.643
Why do people keep calling it a quest?

53:57.828 --> 54:00.272
I know where the Game Child is, man!

54:00.607 --> 54:01.891
Oh, fantastic! Where?!

54:02.299 --> 54:04.105
Follow me.

54:05.364 --> 54:09.332
But, before we go, I must warn you both...

54:10.323 --> 54:11.794
The path is not going to be easy.

54:12.632 --> 54:14.691
It's going to be filled with treacherous obstacles,

54:15.123 --> 54:18.734
and danger, and stuff.

54:20.107 --> 54:20.813
Understood.

54:22.321 --> 54:22.804
Very well.

54:22.655 --> 54:26.655
Stuart, it's filled with stuff! That could be anything!

54:26.655 --> 54:27.255
I know.

54:27.676 --> 54:29.205
I know, calm down.

54:31.377 --> 54:33.565
Oh, come on Guide. We've been walking for days!

54:33.972 --> 54:35.418
It's not too far now.

54:35.795 --> 54:37.088
My legs are killing me.

54:37.555 --> 54:38.459
My feet as well!

54:38.858 --> 54:39.894
His moaning is killing me.

54:40.205 --> 54:42.126
Treat the frisbee as if it was your own child.

54:42.543 --> 54:45.375
Throw it out of your hand like your first born son.

54:45.855 --> 54:48.005
You're really channeling Mother Earth's energy.

54:48.245 --> 54:50.299
This is like Tron Legacy, only less disappointing!

54:52.967 --> 54:53.893
There's stuff in my face!

54:55.242 --> 54:56.534
Nature's eating me!

54:56.666 --> 54:57.104
Come on, let it out.

54:57.227 --> 54:59.129
That is the lamest thing I've ever seen in my life.

54:59.175 --> 55:00.232
You can talk, hippy boy!

55:09.549 --> 55:10.918
There's someone I want to introduce you to.

55:11.454 --> 55:14.316
A good old friend of mine, isn't that right you old son of a birch?!

55:16.466 --> 55:17.491
We need to be cracking on, mate.

55:18.053 --> 55:19.837
Come on, Guide, let's not.

55:21.626 --> 55:23.365
Guide! Come on!

55:24.655 --> 55:25.874
We'll always have Woodstock.

55:26.326 --> 55:28.585
I'm about to channel the energy from the frisbee.

55:30.092 --> 55:31.737
Yeah, you keep doing that.

55:34.519 --> 55:35.887
A toast to a good time!

55:36.416 --> 55:37.249
And clean bowels.

55:37.819 --> 55:39.224
That's the best kind!

55:43.807 --> 55:44.761
We're here, man.

55:44.804 --> 55:46.327
You said it was going to be dangerous!

55:47.149 --> 55:48.717
Well, you know, that coffee was hot.

55:48.717 --> 55:50.932
And I hurt my finger playing frisbee.

55:50.932 --> 55:52.439
Fair enough...

55:52.905 --> 55:55.598
So, the Game Child's in here. What is this place?

55:55.995 --> 56:01.187
The Game Child has traveled across many paths, and this is its current home.

56:01.529 --> 56:06.016
A really, super-cool, hip, conceptual artist has used it in his latest exhibition.

56:06.505 --> 56:07.898
So how to we get past the electric fence?

56:07.898 --> 56:11.118
Oh, this fence isn't actually electrified.

56:11.118 --> 56:13.063
It's just an illusion, dude.

56:13.374 --> 56:15.065
It's designed to deter the uninitiated.

56:15.478 --> 56:16.322
Are you sure?

56:16.738 --> 56:18.859
Have I steered you the wrong way yet?

56:19.349 --> 56:20.403
Well, no, but look at the sign.

56:20.403 --> 56:21.565
Then just chill!

56:21.565 --> 56:23.443
Trust me, dude!

56:23.743 --> 56:25.493
Shouldn't we test it or something first, at least?

56:25.493 --> 56:31.085
There's no need for tests, when you have faith in your own knowledge.

56:33.456 --> 56:34.575
Bloody hell!

56:36.076 --> 56:36.732
Get a stick!

56:37.700 --> 56:39.182
Oh God, hang in there man, you'll be fine!

56:39.478 --> 56:40.596
Unless you're already dead!

56:40.596 --> 56:41.385
I can't tell!

56:41.709 --> 56:42.860
Electricity is your friend.

56:42.860 --> 56:43.787
Just go with the flow!

56:43.787 --> 56:46.591
I'm running out of reassuring things to say!

56:46.591 --> 56:48.497
It's the amps that kill you, not the volts!

56:54.996 --> 56:55.407
Guide?

56:56.801 --> 56:58.855
Guide, are you okay?

57:00.175 --> 57:03.337
Psst! Come on, sleepyhead!

57:03.337 --> 57:05.393
Time for school.

57:06.407 --> 57:07.500
Stuart, I don't think he's going to make it!

57:08.346 --> 57:09.186
Poor guy!

57:10.701 --> 57:13.274
On the plus side, I think he shorted out the electric fence.

57:26.629 --> 57:30.752
Well at least his death wasn't entirely in vain.

57:31.928 --> 57:33.005
What shall we do with the body?

57:33.773 --> 57:34.539
Don't worry, Stuart.

57:35.600 --> 57:38.412
A true Chef knows how to honor his fallen comrades.

58:01.786 --> 58:03.153
Woah! Hang on there!

58:03.853 --> 58:06.582
There could be alarms, and sensors, and red laser beams...

58:06.582 --> 58:08.219
You know, like those ones in the movies?

58:09.321 --> 58:10.208
Let me check.

58:10.473 --> 58:11.134
Don't worry, Stuart.

58:11.134 --> 58:14.189
A true Chef will always defer to a security expert.

58:14.617 --> 58:15.567
Good for you.

58:18.377 --> 58:21.172
Yep, just as I thought.

58:21.767 --> 58:23.780
Red lasers everywhere.

58:24.014 --> 58:24.417
Oh, God.

58:25.426 --> 58:26.804
I'm going to need to talk you through this.

58:27.443 --> 58:28.170
You up to it?

58:28.572 --> 58:29.370
I don't know, I jus-

58:29.370 --> 58:31.004
You can do this, Geoff.

58:31.718 --> 58:32.699
I believe in you.

58:33.211 --> 58:34.267
You believe in me?!

58:35.850 --> 58:36.689
I can do this, Stuart.

58:37.000 --> 58:37.855
I can do this!

58:38.676 --> 58:41.431
Right. Focus, look straight ahead,

58:41.431 --> 58:44.009
and do exactly as I say, when I say it, yeah?

58:47.130 --> 58:48.030
Three steps forward.

58:48.086 --> 58:48.621
Okay.

58:49.972 --> 58:50.488
Stop!

58:51.268 --> 58:53.367
Excellent, now raise your left arm in the air.

58:53.826 --> 58:54.392
Like this?

58:54.392 --> 58:56.724
Yep, higher, as far as you can get it.

58:57.106 --> 58:58.494
That's good, very good.

58:58.850 --> 59:00.417
Now, Left leg, bring it up.

59:01.151 --> 59:01.844
Little bit higher.

59:01.844 --> 59:02.322
Is that okay?

59:02.531 --> 59:02.971
Good.

59:02.971 --> 59:03.599
Very good.

59:03.933 --> 59:05.953
Now, spin your foot around in a circle.

59:06.987 --> 59:07.823
A little bit wider.

59:07.823 --> 59:09.292
I can't look at this, I'm not looking, Stu!

59:09.292 --> 59:11.843
Now, with your right arm, pat your head.

59:11.843 --> 59:12.489
Like this?

59:12.741 --> 59:13.619
That's it.

59:13.619 --> 59:14.592
Keep going, it's good!

59:14.954 --> 59:15.410
Calm down!

59:15.410 --> 59:15.945
Calm down!

59:16.089 --> 59:16.768
Keep going.

59:16.768 --> 59:17.403
I can't!

59:21.922 --> 59:22.737
There's nothing there!

59:24.501 --> 59:25.662
I thought I was going to die!

59:25.690 --> 59:27.141
Yeah, you always were gullible.

59:28.682 --> 59:30.197
Come on, let's get this thing.

59:44.083 --> 59:44.925
Stuart, it's-

01:00:16.067 --> 01:00:17.131
It's the Game Child!

01:00:18.605 --> 01:00:19.701
It's the Game Child.

01:00:24.621 --> 01:00:25.452
What's that?!

01:00:30.036 --> 01:00:31.989
Stuart, I'm sorry!

01:00:33.788 --> 01:00:37.483
What's happening? What are you doing?!

01:00:42.385 --> 01:00:44.486
So what's a Game Child when it's at home?

01:00:44.931 --> 01:00:47.245
I had it! I had it in my hands!

01:00:47.256 --> 01:00:47.697
I know!

01:00:48.996 --> 01:00:50.081
I don't understand!

01:00:50.081 --> 01:00:51.254
How did they know we were there?!

01:00:51.510 --> 01:00:53.500
I don't know, we must have tripped an alarm or something.

01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:56.247
They couldn't possibly have got there that quick though!

01:00:56.484 --> 01:00:57.709
I don't know!!!

01:00:58.199 --> 01:00:59.967
What's gotten into you?!

01:01:02.289 --> 01:01:05.563
Nothing's gotten to me! Nothing! I'm fine!

01:01:06.737 --> 01:01:07.551
You've been bailed.

01:01:07.988 --> 01:01:08.699
Excellent!

01:01:09.140 --> 01:01:09.992
Just him.

01:01:10.430 --> 01:01:10.988
What?

01:01:18.084 --> 01:01:22.135
Ashley? What the hell are you doing here?!

01:01:23.057 --> 01:01:24.501
And what are you doing with that prat?!

01:01:25.134 --> 01:01:25.802
Idiot!

01:01:26.477 --> 01:01:29.484
Stewie! Nice to see you again!

01:01:30.029 --> 01:01:30.980
How long has it been?

01:01:31.416 --> 01:01:33.661
What, since you slept with the Professor, dumped me, and disappeared?

01:01:34.479 --> 01:01:38.040
About ten years, five months, and two days.

01:01:38.641 --> 01:01:39.554
Oh, Stewie...

01:01:39.995 --> 01:01:42.751
It's Stuart! Not Stewie. I always hated "Stewie".

01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:44.278
Fine, Stuart.

01:01:44.621 --> 01:01:49.064
First off, Nemesis and I, we're... Friends.

01:01:50.390 --> 01:01:52.410
Nemesis... That's a ridiculous name!

01:01:52.766 --> 01:01:55.606
I told you! It's pronounced "Nee Mah Si"!

01:01:55.606 --> 01:01:56.886
Stress the "I"!

01:01:57.345 --> 01:01:58.277
It's Japanese!

01:01:58.277 --> 01:01:58.872
Yes!

01:01:59.326 --> 01:02:00.476
And more importantly,

01:02:00.476 --> 01:02:02.483
your friend Geoff here,

01:02:03.724 --> 01:02:05.080
he works for me.

01:02:05.577 --> 01:02:06.786
I'm really sorry, Stuart.

01:02:07.243 --> 01:02:08.231
They gave me my old job back.

01:02:08.392 --> 01:02:09.641
I just couldn't say no.

01:02:11.271 --> 01:02:12.524
You bastard!

01:02:12.524 --> 01:02:15.771
You ridiculous, fake chef, bastard.

01:02:15.771 --> 01:02:16.803
You can't even cook!

01:02:16.803 --> 01:02:20.991
A true Chef doesn't need to know how to cook, or boil water, or-

01:02:21.208 --> 01:02:22.734
And your friend, Marian.

01:02:22.734 --> 01:02:25.227
Well, she also works for me now.

01:02:29.044 --> 01:02:32.139
Fine. What has all this got to do with me?

01:02:32.430 --> 01:02:33.650
You still haven't worked it out?

01:02:34.518 --> 01:02:35.753
We want the Game Child.

01:02:36.003 --> 01:02:40.789
I always thought your obsession with the Game Child was so childish!

01:02:41.174 --> 01:02:43.629
If only I had known.

01:02:44.786 --> 01:02:46.082
But Daddy enlightened me.

01:02:46.568 --> 01:02:48.182
Oh, your father, yeah...

01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:50.995
Yeah the great man who spent the last half of his life in a straight jacket.

01:02:50.995 --> 01:02:53.860
And he never told you that you were pretty when you were a little girl.

01:02:54.327 --> 01:02:54.992
Tragic.

01:02:55.189 --> 01:02:56.730
I'm over that!

01:03:01.708 --> 01:03:03.575
We couldn't find the Game Child.

01:03:03.973 --> 01:03:05.088
But I knew you could.

01:03:05.725 --> 01:03:07.814
You just needed a little encouragement.

01:03:08.287 --> 01:03:10.272
So it was you who send the magazine with that text.

01:03:10.814 --> 01:03:11.879
Everybody leave.

01:03:12.990 --> 01:03:14.493
I want to be alone with Stuart.

01:03:16.380 --> 01:03:17.200
Idiot!

01:03:18.998 --> 01:03:20.880
I'm really... So sorry...

01:03:23.778 --> 01:03:26.269
Ashens... And Ashley...

01:03:28.493 --> 01:03:29.952
I always found that rather amusing.

01:03:30.412 --> 01:03:31.981
Yeah, and you always were easily amused.

01:03:32.768 --> 01:03:33.991
We did have fun back then.

01:03:34.861 --> 01:03:35.905
Young love, and all that.

01:03:37.081 --> 01:03:38.789
But I won't lie to you Stuart.

01:03:39.311 --> 01:03:41.401
You were just a stepping stone.

01:03:42.026 --> 01:03:46.067
In my youth, I was a bit... Insensitive.

01:03:47.357 --> 01:03:51.649
But who would have known that spending time with little old you,

01:03:51.870 --> 01:03:56.484
would reveal the importance of the Game Child!

01:03:57.511 --> 01:03:59.962
The Game Child is inherently worthless.

01:04:00.333 --> 01:04:05.227
Oh, Stuart. Even worthless things have their uses sometimes.

01:04:07.055 --> 01:04:11.425
Oh, and by the way, it was me all those years ago,

01:04:11.425 --> 01:04:14.850
who told the university about my affair with the Professor.

01:04:15.694 --> 01:04:16.489
Oopsie.

01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:19.898
Do you mind?!

01:04:20.145 --> 01:04:21.151
Sorry.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:22.999
Goodbye, Stuart.

01:04:23.774 --> 01:04:24.689
Enjoy your stay.

01:04:30.094 --> 01:04:33.548
Man! That is one crazy broad!

01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:35.349
You're not wrong.

01:05:39.063 --> 01:05:39.901
Oh my God...

01:05:40.667 --> 01:05:41.575
Are you who I think you are?!

01:05:41.995 --> 01:05:42.752
Maybe?

01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:44.980
You're the guy who does the comedy thing!

01:05:45.334 --> 01:05:46.184
Yeah... Yeah that's me.

01:05:46.184 --> 01:05:47.187
Oh my God!!!

01:05:47.236 --> 01:05:48.239
I love you!

01:05:48.585 --> 01:05:50.953
You're so funny, with your weird sense of humour!

01:05:51.444 --> 01:05:53.337
Thanks, thanks, yeah...

01:05:53.694 --> 01:05:56.766
You okay? You seem a bit down.

01:05:56.946 --> 01:06:00.074
Sorry, yeah, I just had a really bad couple of days.

01:06:00.226 --> 01:06:02.059
Do you want to tell me about it.

01:06:02.460 --> 01:06:05.251
I don't know, just sometimes I wonder why I bother.

01:06:05.251 --> 01:06:07.815
You can't be like that! Not you!

01:06:08.055 --> 01:06:11.855
Thousands of people cherish your work, and all the hilarious things you make!

01:06:12.221 --> 01:06:14.846
You're a hero of mine...

01:06:15.099 --> 01:06:16.380
Really?!

01:06:16.580 --> 01:06:17.448
Hell, yeah!

01:06:17.794 --> 01:06:21.178
Look, I know some people don't understand why you do what you do,

01:06:21.178 --> 01:06:22.547
but that's no reason to give up!

01:06:22.749 --> 01:06:23.684
Keep on going!

01:06:24.056 --> 01:06:24.974
Do it for your fans!!!

01:06:25.859 --> 01:06:26.591
Yeah!

01:06:26.724 --> 01:06:27.594
Yeah, you're right!

01:06:28.101 --> 01:06:30.829
People have always doubted me, and it's never stopped me before!

01:06:30.849 --> 01:06:32.139
Why should it stop me now?!

01:06:32.667 --> 01:06:35.017
Thanks anonymous stranger, you've been extremely helpful.

01:06:35.130 --> 01:06:36.610
Oh my God, no problem!!!

01:06:36.610 --> 01:06:37.709
Glad I could help!!!

01:06:40.536 --> 01:06:41.806
You're not going to believe this!

01:06:42.496 --> 01:06:43.508
Guess who I just met!

01:06:44.247 --> 01:06:44.994
Guess!

01:06:45.773 --> 01:06:46.274
Who?!

01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:49.237
I just met Simon Pegg!!!

01:06:49.448 --> 01:06:50.680
I know!!!

01:06:53.818 --> 01:06:54.768
Citizen!

01:06:56.300 --> 01:06:58.283
Get in the car, citizen. You're not safe here.

01:06:58.283 --> 01:06:59.862
Oh, no that's fin-

01:06:59.862 --> 01:07:01.212
Get in the back of the car!

01:07:01.603 --> 01:07:03.723
Your very life hangs in the balance, my friend.

01:07:09.014 --> 01:07:09.898
Quickly!

01:07:10.695 --> 01:07:13.822
Woo! Dodged a bullet there, mate.

01:07:14.191 --> 01:07:15.046
Really? How?

01:07:15.324 --> 01:07:17.060
Lot of weirdos around here, my friend.

01:07:17.465 --> 01:07:19.264
We've been beaten up in that alleyway, just there.

01:07:19.254 --> 01:07:23.254
Why did you keep going back?

01:07:19.264 --> 01:07:20.084
Five times.

01:07:20.084 --> 01:07:21.281
By the same old lady.

01:07:23.254 --> 01:07:23.886
It was kind of hot!

01:07:28.787 --> 01:07:29.994
Need a lift anywhere then, mate?

01:07:30.292 --> 01:07:32.565
Uh... yeah, that's why I got in the car.

01:07:32.998 --> 01:07:35.522
I'm going to the headquarters of the Terrifically Good Company.

01:07:35.897 --> 01:07:37.275
Are you going to the old industrial estate?

01:07:37.723 --> 01:07:38.446
Well, I dunno, we're pretty-

01:07:38.803 --> 01:07:40.543
Sure are, big balls!

01:07:43.258 --> 01:07:48.229
... Thanks, thanks... So are you two off
to a fancy dress party or something?

01:07:48.239 --> 01:07:49.334
What? No!

01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:52.360
- We're Knighthood and Decoy!
- Britain's best super heroes!

01:07:49.334 --> 01:07:53.730
Britain's only super heroes!

01:07:53.978 --> 01:07:55.299
Why, are you going to a party?!

01:07:55.621 --> 01:07:56.624
Oh, God no.

01:07:56.624 --> 01:08:00.475
I hate parties. I'm actually on a mission at the moment.

01:08:00.475 --> 01:08:01.362
Ooh...

01:08:01.485 --> 01:08:03.349
That's a shame. We love parties.

01:08:03.873 --> 01:08:05.818
# Everybody does!

01:08:06.268 --> 01:08:09.034
# Make love to the music!

01:08:09.305 --> 01:08:09.644
# And-

01:08:09.644 --> 01:08:12.578
Don't, don't ever, make love to the music.

01:08:12.578 --> 01:08:13.237
Sorry.

01:08:14.565 --> 01:08:16.081
Here we are, sugar-tits.

01:08:16.270 --> 01:08:17.108
... Thanks...

01:08:17.108 --> 01:08:19.175
You know, you really shouldn't do this mission of yours alone.

01:08:19.175 --> 01:08:19.999
Very Dangerous.

01:08:20.339 --> 01:08:22.394
Yeah, I've been thinking about that a lot recently.

01:08:22.627 --> 01:08:25.109
Thanks, ever so much for the lift. Very kind.

01:08:25.109 --> 01:08:25.863
Take these.

01:08:26.251 --> 01:08:27.202
Thanks.

01:08:27.202 --> 01:08:27.933
And this.

01:08:28.386 --> 01:08:30.635
Never know when that's going to come in handy.

01:08:30.819 --> 01:08:32.990
Probably for tying something, or someone up.

01:08:32.990 --> 01:08:36.535
And making objects far away seem nearer than they are, but it's up to you.

01:08:36.899 --> 01:08:38.600
Well, thanks, that's very kind of you.

01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:39.154
And here!

01:08:39.165 --> 01:08:39.712
Jesus!

01:08:39.712 --> 01:08:40.795
Have this.

01:08:41.238 --> 01:08:44.278
It's a complimentary Limited Edition Knighthood and Decoy Cheese Knife.

01:08:44.692 --> 01:08:45.578
That's great, great.

01:08:45.913 --> 01:08:46.680
Remember...

01:08:47.107 --> 01:08:50.425
"Cut the cheese, with Knighthood and Decoy!"

01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:52.913
Catchy...

01:08:53.127 --> 01:08:56.928
Thank you for the culinary utensils.

01:08:56.685 --> 01:08:57.381
No worries.

01:09:01.404 --> 01:09:04.323
You're a sweet, sweet man. Take care.

01:09:04.323 --> 01:09:05.331
Good luck with the Mish!

01:09:06.983 --> 01:09:07.785
Nice guy.

01:09:07.818 --> 01:09:09.305
Very nice! Very nice.

01:09:10.241 --> 01:09:11.005
Didn't leave a tip, though.

01:09:11.005 --> 01:09:12.321
Yeh, like petrol is free.

01:09:18.978 --> 01:09:19.761
I gave him a cheese knife.

01:09:19.761 --> 01:09:21.345
Yeah, but that's merchandise.

01:09:21.345 --> 01:09:22.232
That's marketing.

01:09:22.232 --> 01:09:23.630
Yeah, so he'll remember us.

01:09:24.058 --> 01:09:26.276
Everytime he cuts the cheese.

01:09:42.629 --> 01:09:44.184
You shouldn't have come here, Stuart.

01:09:46.392 --> 01:09:48.210
Oh look, it's Chef Judas!

01:09:48.407 --> 01:09:50.974
A true Chef knows how to stab his friends in the back!

01:09:51.410 --> 01:09:52.455
You just couldn't let it go, could you?!

01:09:52.455 --> 01:09:54.798
You couldn't stand to see my name in lights!

01:09:54.798 --> 01:09:55.677
What?

01:09:55.721 --> 01:09:56.321
Enough!

01:09:57.049 --> 01:09:57.827
Give me that.

01:10:00.490 --> 01:10:01.122
What are you doing?

01:10:01.571 --> 01:10:02.504
I'm sorry, Stuart.

01:10:07.241 --> 01:10:08.389
Drop your weapons. I said drop them!

01:10:09.108 --> 01:10:11.280
Put your hands up! I said down! Get Down!

01:10:14.851 --> 01:10:15.859
So it was all a trick then?

01:10:16.177 --> 01:10:19.652
Yeah... Yeah it was uhh... Just a ruse to help us on our quest-

01:10:19.652 --> 01:10:20.242
I mean on our-

01:10:22.358 --> 01:10:22.956
No.

01:10:23.511 --> 01:10:25.375
No, it wasn't, Stuart. I did betray you.

01:10:25.821 --> 01:10:28.713
I'm sorry, I just really wanted my old life back.

01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:32.077
But when I finally had it, I realised I didn't need it anymore.

01:10:32.822 --> 01:10:36.902
It's alright, it's been good having you along,

01:10:36.902 --> 01:10:39.058
and I know I haven't exactly been the best friend.

01:10:39.566 --> 01:10:40.454
Thanks, Stuart.

01:10:41.224 --> 01:10:43.432
Oh, God. I forgot! They've got Marian.

01:10:43.432 --> 01:10:45.233
Yeah, she's working with-

01:10:45.233 --> 01:10:46.611
No! They've taken her captive!

01:10:46.611 --> 01:10:47.697
Really?!

01:10:47.697 --> 01:10:48.443
Yeah!

01:11:06.513 --> 01:11:07.615
I've got an idea!

01:11:07.989 --> 01:11:09.313
You seen the original Star Wars?

01:11:09.313 --> 01:11:11.635
Yeah! Of course I have!

01:11:11.656 --> 01:11:13.236
I've seen all the Star Wars films.

01:11:13.390 --> 01:11:19.580
Now, you remember with Luke and Han, dress up in Stormtrooper armour to rescue Leia from the Death Star?

01:11:19.580 --> 01:11:21.386
Yeah...

01:11:21.608 --> 01:11:24.586
We could do exactly that!

01:11:36.271 --> 01:11:37.492
Hang on, mate.

01:11:38.902 --> 01:11:41.599
That's not the right holster for that blaster rifle!

01:11:56.674 --> 01:11:59.710
I think I know where we went wrong.

01:12:11.279 --> 01:12:12.649
Right, what's the plan?

01:12:12.832 --> 01:12:17.352
Well, the good thing about my betrayal was I was able to find out where they're keeping Marian and the Game Child.

01:12:17.359 --> 01:12:18.028
Excellent!

01:12:18.028 --> 01:12:21.402
All we have to do is hack into their computer system and override their security.

01:12:22.350 --> 01:12:23.852
Which you should be able to do in no time at all.

01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:26.796
Thanks, Geoff, but I'm sure you can handle this.

01:12:28.850 --> 01:12:29.681
Thanks, Stuart.

01:12:29.982 --> 01:12:32.619
Well, it's time to do some serious hacking!

01:13:10.893 --> 01:13:12.430
Good work, Geoff, good work.

01:13:12.784 --> 01:13:13.987
Uhh... Thanks...

01:13:14.887 --> 01:13:16.094
There they are, level B.

01:13:16.660 --> 01:13:17.858
This way.

01:13:36.270 --> 01:13:37.750
Twenty years! Twenty years!

01:13:38.195 --> 01:13:39.035
That's where we need to go.

01:13:40.031 --> 01:13:41.070
But wait a second...

01:13:41.376 --> 01:13:43.357
That's the guy they replaced me with.

01:13:43.956 --> 01:13:45.040
That's Chef Brilliance!

01:13:45.976 --> 01:13:48.056
But it looks like he's been booted down to security.

01:13:48.695 --> 01:13:49.509
Well that must make you happy.

01:13:51.037 --> 01:13:53.004
You know what? It doesn't.

01:13:54.348 --> 01:13:56.026
I'll create a distraction and draw him away from the door.

01:13:56.502 --> 01:13:58.641
No, don't worry about that. We'll work something out together.

01:13:59.606 --> 01:14:02.515
It's alright, Stuart. I want to do this.

01:14:02.938 --> 01:14:06.161
... women. Baguette cars! Living the high life! I was living the dream!

01:14:07.878 --> 01:14:10.484
Bloody security duty! If my mother could see me now...

01:14:10.484 --> 01:14:14.503
Oi!

01:14:46.947 --> 01:14:49.192
Ashens... With an "S"...

01:14:50.315 --> 01:14:52.699
Aren't you tired of losing to me?!

01:14:53.182 --> 01:14:54.671
Even I'm bored of it!

01:14:55.510 --> 01:14:56.915
You're not going to win this time!

01:14:57.691 --> 01:14:58.604
You're old.

01:14:59.247 --> 01:15:02.123
A Relic of a bygone era.

01:15:02.636 --> 01:15:06.573
I am the better man in every way.

01:15:07.823 --> 01:15:08.589
You're just an-

01:15:08.589 --> 01:15:09.175
Ow!

01:15:11.856 --> 01:15:12.659
Idiot.

01:15:23.269 --> 01:15:23.930
You!

01:15:24.678 --> 01:15:27.028
Why did you have to come back and take my job?!

01:15:27.249 --> 01:15:28.326
It was my job first!

01:15:28.326 --> 01:15:29.053
You were gone!

01:15:29.559 --> 01:15:31.382
It was mine! Mine! Mine!!!

01:15:35.171 --> 01:15:38.681
Oh, Marian, I am so sorry about this!

01:15:39.900 --> 01:15:40.599
Alright there?

01:15:40.599 --> 01:15:43.816
It's fine! Just bloody hurry up before they come back!

01:15:44.265 --> 01:15:46.104
Alright, I've never actually done this before.

01:15:47.045 --> 01:15:48.520
I met your ex-girlfriend.

01:15:48.842 --> 01:15:51.414
So that's the type you go for, is it? Completely mental?

01:15:51.857 --> 01:15:52.958
It was a long time ago!

01:15:53.765 --> 01:15:54.985
I'm going to have to cut this. Hold still.

01:15:54.985 --> 01:15:55.405
Quick!

01:15:58.138 --> 01:15:59.062
Yep, it's going.

01:15:59.510 --> 01:16:00.213
Stewie.

01:16:01.371 --> 01:16:03.703
Step away from your little girlfriend.

01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:08.989
Uh-uh! Back up!

01:16:10.184 --> 01:16:11.245
No misbehaving now.

01:16:12.003 --> 01:16:12.891
Stuart!

01:16:35.835 --> 01:16:37.876
I know I haven't been very nice to you, Stuart,

01:16:37.938 --> 01:16:39.428
but I still need your help.

01:16:40.104 --> 01:16:44.306
It seems that Game Child is encrypted, and I really need access to it.

01:16:44.683 --> 01:16:46.974
What you really need is access to psychiatric help!

01:16:47.662 --> 01:16:48.940
N-n-no! Don't do that!

01:16:49.271 --> 01:16:52.689
Aww, that's so sweet! Aww...

01:16:52.998 --> 01:16:55.136
I'll give you one minute before I pull the trigger.

01:16:55.636 --> 01:16:56.666
Starting...

01:16:57.916 --> 01:16:58.550
Now.

01:16:59.290 --> 01:17:01.703
This is ridiculous! This thing can't be encrypted!

01:17:02.009 --> 01:17:03.222
But it is...

01:17:15.528 --> 01:17:16.502
You want to do this?

01:17:16.502 --> 01:17:17.360
Bring it on!

01:17:18.912 --> 01:17:22.239
I'm sure you want to know what is so secret about the Game Child.

01:17:22.551 --> 01:17:26.992
It's something so special that even you didn't know.

01:17:27.301 --> 01:17:32.769
When assembled together correctly, the Game Child makes a nuclear bomb!

01:17:33.007 --> 01:17:35.072
Good God! What are you talking about?!

01:17:35.136 --> 01:17:36.629
You're as mental as your father!

01:17:36.629 --> 01:17:37.896
He wasn't mental!

01:17:37.896 --> 01:17:39.844
It was a misdiagnosis!

01:17:40.969 --> 01:17:42.102
45 seconds.

01:17:42.776 --> 01:17:44.428
It was all very Top Secret.

01:17:44.975 --> 01:17:46.301
It was at the end of The Cold War.

01:17:46.301 --> 01:17:49.769
You couldn't walk more than ten feet without tripping over some plutonium!

01:17:50.348 --> 01:17:52.185
A deranged factory worker had the idea.

01:17:52.185 --> 01:17:58.027
To smuggle a simple, yet effective nuclear weapon, in the first shipment of Game Childs.

01:17:58.483 --> 01:18:00.098
That's absolutely ridiculous!

01:18:00.470 --> 01:18:01.524
30 seconds!

01:18:02.355 --> 01:18:07.268
Our company was responsible for the shipment, but Daddy only realised after he shipped the first two hundred.

01:18:07.689 --> 01:18:09.761
He of course, recalled them.

01:18:10.858 --> 01:18:12.912
Daddy always wanted his own nuclear bomb.

01:18:24.048 --> 01:18:26.825
The Crazy Octopus! The Crazy Octopus!

01:18:27.042 --> 01:18:28.026
Argh!

01:18:28.476 --> 01:18:29.908
15 seconds!

01:18:30.256 --> 01:18:32.084
But there was one missing.

01:18:32.440 --> 01:18:35.081
One, with the trigger device, and we couldn't find it.

01:18:35.688 --> 01:18:37.201
Not until I pulled your strings.

01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:40.042
And here we are.

01:18:40.042 --> 01:18:44.047
So what was your plan? Were you going to set it off and hide in a fridge?

01:18:44.247 --> 01:18:45.382
10 seconds!!!

01:18:45.454 --> 01:18:46.557
Hurry, Stuart!

01:18:46.557 --> 01:18:47.965
My finger might slip!!!

01:18:48.422 --> 01:18:50.403
You know, I've always wanted to blow something up.

01:18:50.403 --> 01:18:51.591
I'm not sure what, yet.

01:18:51.992 --> 01:18:54.551
Maybe a pub, or a house full of collectibles!

01:18:56.669 --> 01:18:57.177
Five.

01:18:57.177 --> 01:18:57.497
Four.

01:18:57.497 --> 01:18:57.956
Three.

01:18:57.956 --> 01:18:58.389
Two.

01:18:58.413 --> 01:19:00.465
Hang on! Up Up Down Down Left Right Left Right...

01:19:00.465 --> 01:19:02.810
Got it! Thank you Konami!

01:19:05.181 --> 01:19:06.755
Thank you, Stuart.

01:19:07.196 --> 01:19:09.961
You see? We are good for each other.

01:19:10.435 --> 01:19:12.531
I know how to motivate you.

01:19:14.196 --> 01:19:15.277
Ashens!

01:19:15.821 --> 01:19:17.788
You got lucky this time.

01:19:17.788 --> 01:19:20.305
But don't think that changes anything!

01:19:20.305 --> 01:19:24.107
I am still your superior in every wa-

01:19:24.107 --> 01:19:24.906
Argh!

01:19:26.489 --> 01:19:28.607
I was expecting that, you idiot!

01:19:29.151 --> 01:19:31.465
So you were expecting it, but you didn't get out of the way.

01:19:31.465 --> 01:19:33.450
I like being punched in the face...

01:19:33.841 --> 01:19:35.675
You like being punched in the face?

01:19:36.508 --> 01:19:37.260
Yes...

01:19:38.326 --> 01:19:38.923
No!

01:19:39.504 --> 01:19:40.796
Let's see how you like it!

01:19:44.676 --> 01:19:48.865
There is no defense against The Crane Kick, old man!

01:19:52.235 --> 01:19:53.304
Walk towards me then!

01:19:53.420 --> 01:19:54.011
No.

01:19:54.011 --> 01:19:55.882
It doesn't work unless you're walking towards me.

01:19:55.882 --> 01:19:56.696
I don't care!

01:19:56.696 --> 01:19:57.245
Come on!

01:19:57.245 --> 01:19:58.038
No!

01:19:58.350 --> 01:19:59.646
Ah! I'm getting cramp!

01:19:59.646 --> 01:20:00.329
Good!

01:20:00.585 --> 01:20:04.335
I'm going to switch legs. Don't attack me while I'm changing over.

01:20:05.394 --> 01:20:06.302
Do you promise?

01:20:06.777 --> 01:20:07.242
No.

01:20:07.822 --> 01:20:08.540
Please promise.

01:20:08.909 --> 01:20:09.324
No!

01:20:09.324 --> 01:20:10.128
Pretty Please!

01:20:11.091 --> 01:20:12.178
Okay, fine.

01:20:14.217 --> 01:20:15.284
Argh!

01:20:17.284 --> 01:20:18.895
I should have seen that coming!

01:20:19.370 --> 01:20:20.711
Oh, my balls!!!

01:20:21.406 --> 01:20:23.336
My precious balls!

01:20:25.292 --> 01:20:27.383
You always were a pathetic excuse for a Chef!

01:20:27.383 --> 01:20:29.040
You never did deserve to wear the uniform!

01:20:31.469 --> 01:20:32.374
Aren't you going to fight back?!

01:20:32.374 --> 01:20:34.438
Of course not! I'm a strict pacifist!

01:20:34.438 --> 01:20:38.673
For a true Chef knows that he must never harm another person,

01:20:38.673 --> 01:20:41.964
for even his worst enemy is still a potential customer.

01:20:42.425 --> 01:20:44.959
Hm. I never thought of it like that.

01:20:45.247 --> 01:20:46.030
Argh!

01:20:46.030 --> 01:20:46.787
Argh!

01:20:56.140 --> 01:20:56.975
Stuart...

01:20:57.347 --> 01:20:59.130
I'll have the Game Child now!

01:21:00.021 --> 01:21:02.927
You know, this quest has taught me a lot of things,

01:21:03.086 --> 01:21:06.906
and it's taught me that this is not important.

01:21:08.628 --> 01:21:10.167
Don't make me laugh!

01:21:10.447 --> 01:21:13.519
The Game Child is the only thing that's important to you.

01:21:13.934 --> 01:21:14.684
Maybe once.

01:21:16.192 --> 01:21:17.543
But you're forgetting something.

01:21:17.998 --> 01:21:21.039
You told me that this is special, and of immense value.

01:21:21.793 --> 01:21:23.743
And? Your point is?

01:21:24.144 --> 01:21:27.009
Things of worth, are worthless to me!

01:21:31.076 --> 01:21:31.798
No!

01:21:32.316 --> 01:21:32.871
No!

01:21:32.871 --> 01:21:35.753
No, no, no!

01:21:36.796 --> 01:21:37.918
You ruined it!

01:21:38.218 --> 01:21:39.516
You ruined it all!

01:21:40.128 --> 01:21:40.837
Die!

01:21:44.059 --> 01:21:45.442
Great work, Marian!

01:21:46.047 --> 01:21:48.628
I'm so sorry I got you mixed up in all this.

01:21:49.128 --> 01:21:51.765
Don't apologise! That was amazing!

01:21:52.481 --> 01:21:54.339
I hardly ever get to punch anyone in the library!

01:21:56.218 --> 01:21:56.956
Stuart!

01:21:57.313 --> 01:21:58.080
Everything okay?

01:21:58.455 --> 01:21:59.173
It is now.

01:21:59.845 --> 01:22:00.605
It is now.

01:22:01.866 --> 01:22:05.135
So I guess someone should probably call the police or something.

01:22:05.471 --> 01:22:06.645
Yeah, definitely.

01:22:09.471 --> 01:22:10.495
Oh, I've lost my phone.

01:22:10.603 --> 01:22:12.132
I can't believe it, mine was in my satchel.

01:22:12.823 --> 01:22:14.445
There was a call-box when we came in.

01:22:14.445 --> 01:22:16.200
Just around the corner.

01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:17.521
Has anyone got any change?

01:22:18.282 --> 01:22:18.830
Uh...

01:22:19.300 --> 01:22:20.860
I had some, but I bought some mints.

01:22:21.217 --> 01:22:21.957
Don't look at me, I'm homeless.

01:22:21.957 --> 01:22:22.868
And I dropped the mints.

01:22:23.087 --> 01:22:24.134
Oh, it's 999, it's free!

01:22:24.728 --> 01:22:25.100
Is it?

01:22:25.100 --> 01:22:25.617
Yeah.

01:22:26.008 --> 01:22:26.335
It's not.

01:22:26.335 --> 01:22:27.861
It's only free after 6pm isn't it?

01:22:28.209 --> 01:22:29.392
No, it's always free, it's an emergency!

01:22:29.392 --> 01:22:31.337
No, they charge you, I've been charged for that.

01:22:32.509 --> 01:22:33.688
Oh God, she's waking up. Stamp on her!

01:22:33.718 --> 01:22:34.392
Stamp on her!

01:22:40.351 --> 01:22:41.355
That's him! That's him!

01:22:51.527 --> 01:22:52.906
I never loved you.

01:22:53.580 --> 01:22:54.353
I know.

01:23:03.127 --> 01:23:04.543
So what do we do now?

01:23:04.908 --> 01:23:07.491
Well, isn't it obvious? We're going to have a party!

01:23:07.869 --> 01:23:09.794
No, you know I don't like parties!

01:23:09.824 --> 01:23:10.700
I'm an island!

01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:12.666
Oh, come on, Stuart!

01:23:12.666 --> 01:23:14.928
Haven't you learn anything from this quest?!

01:23:15.395 --> 01:23:17.343
Alright, alright, we're going to have a party.

01:23:17.343 --> 01:23:19.054
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

01:24:02.752 --> 01:24:05.184
Hey guys, I'm Geoff Excellence, and welcome to my channel,

01:24:05.184 --> 01:24:07.101
where we talk about everything that's excellent.

01:24:07.517 --> 01:24:08.844
But you know, it's not just about me.

01:24:09.247 --> 01:24:10.225
I'd love to hear from you guys as well.

01:24:10.225 --> 01:24:11.841
So make sure you leave me a comment below.

01:24:11.984 --> 01:24:12.791
Thumbs up!

01:24:13.214 --> 01:24:14.307
So, yeah, basically that's it!

01:24:14.668 --> 01:24:16.198
You know, I realised I didn't need anybody else.

01:24:16.422 --> 01:24:17.538
I could do it on my own.

01:24:17.538 --> 01:24:18.688
Absolutely amazing.

01:24:18.819 --> 01:24:19.278
Yeah!

01:24:20.764 --> 01:24:22.052
Sorry, what are we looking at exactly?

01:24:22.580 --> 01:24:23.799
That was my YouTube channel.

01:24:24.166 --> 01:24:25.037
Oh... Okay...

01:24:25.037 --> 01:24:26.324
What's YouTube?

01:24:28.001 --> 01:24:28.742
YouTube!

01:24:29.268 --> 01:24:30.522
I'm just asking!

01:24:30.522 --> 01:24:31.499
No... You Tube.

01:24:32.133 --> 01:24:33.173
-Yeah, you're the Tube!

01:24:34.255 --> 01:24:35.598
-Taking the piss out of someone because they didn't understand...

01:24:48.503 --> 01:24:49.473
Richard?

01:24:49.496 --> 01:24:50.166
Hi, Stuart!

01:24:51.477 --> 01:24:52.518
You're not dead are you?

01:24:52.816 --> 01:24:53.753
No, no.

01:24:58.631 --> 01:25:01.766
Ever since you told me about the Game Child, I just had to try it.

01:25:02.323 --> 01:25:03.522
One of the ones full of plutonium?

01:25:03.695 --> 01:25:04.350
Yeah!

01:25:04.350 --> 01:25:05.856
So I called in a favour with MI:6...

01:25:06.952 --> 01:25:09.594
I think I might have radiation poisoning.

01:25:10.422 --> 01:25:11.936
Do you think I could sue someone?

01:25:11.937 --> 01:25:14.163
Maybe... Maybe.

01:25:14.163 --> 01:25:15.318
Yes!

01:25:15.318 --> 01:25:16.471
I'm going to be rich!

01:25:18.306 --> 01:25:19.310
See you back at the party.

01:25:26.220 --> 01:25:27.071
Stuart!

01:25:27.855 --> 01:25:29.198
Come back to the party!

01:25:41.539 --> 01:25:45.938

[goesaroundandaround@gmail.com]

01:25:59.408 --> 01:26:01.520
I am not supposed to be in here!

01:26:04.208 --> 01:26:05.749
Don't you people know who I am?!

01:26:06.999 --> 01:26:09.355
I am a master criminal!

01:26:10.649 --> 01:26:13.205
Why have you put me in here with these plebs?!

01:26:14.810 --> 01:26:16.308
What are you looking at?!

01:26:18.224 --> 01:26:21.257
And why do you have a hat on indoors?!

01:26:21.361 --> 01:26:22.851
Don't you know how hot it is?!

01:26:23.118 --> 01:26:24.771
You complete n00b!

01:26:26.254 --> 01:26:30.362
And you think that tough guy beard makes you look tough?!

01:26:32.250 --> 01:26:33.236
You are both,

01:26:33.988 --> 01:26:35.080
complete,

01:26:35.725 --> 01:26:36.823
IDIOTS!

01:26:38.602 --> 01:26:39.628
Oh, okay.

01:26:40.159 --> 01:26:41.216
You're going to beat me up.

01:26:41.504 --> 01:26:42.944
That old jail clich�!

01:26:44.132 --> 01:26:45.723
Okay, yep, this is happening.

01:26:46.674 --> 01:26:48.725
Okay. I'm not scared.

01:26:49.521 --> 01:26:50.570
Ow! That didn't hurt!

01:26:51.042 --> 01:26:51.767
That didn't hurt either!

01:26:52.214 --> 01:26:53.151
Argh!

01:26:54.763 --> 01:26:56.244
You just broke my pelvis!

01:26:56.927 --> 01:26:58.501
Ah! My sweet pelvis!

01:27:08.090 --> 01:27:14.805
# But where will this lead in the end? For no man is an island of tat.

01:27:15.434 --> 01:27:20.947
# Perhaps what you need is a friend, can you imagine that?

01:27:22.898 --> 01:27:30.011
# Your mission's about to begin, if you don't lose then you might just win.

01:27:31.111 --> 01:27:35.814
# We're routing for you, you odd little bearded prat!

01:27:39.088 --> 01:27:42.231
# Terrible hardware from years gone by,

01:27:42.697 --> 01:27:45.456
# Worthless old relics you claim.

01:27:46.420 --> 01:27:49.869
# There's one left to get now, don't give in and cry.

01:27:50.266 --> 01:27:52.736
# You said that adventure's your game.

01:27:53.370 --> 01:28:00.078
# Oh, but Ashens, is your actual name.

01:28:01.324 --> 01:28:03.492
# Or is it Ashen?

01:28:04.511 --> 01:28:07.444
# Why the extra 'S', Ashens?

01:28:08.364 --> 01:28:10.621
# I'm confused about the 'S'...

01:28:25.789 --> 01:28:31.032
"My Daddy, he likes to blow up the world. What does your daddy like to do?"

01:28:31.470 --> 01:28:37.094
"Well, my name is Ashens, and I collect tat!"

01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:38.613
"Hello!"

01:28:40.138 --> 01:28:43.467
"And maybe, I want a Game Child. Yeah, I do."

01:28:44.136 --> 01:28:45.239
"Hang about, no I don't!"

01:28:45.664 --> 01:28:46.682
You must die!

01:28:46.992 --> 01:28:49.980
Everybody must die!

01:28:50.170 --> 01:28:52.120
Kaboom! Whee!!!

01:28:52.510 --> 01:28:54.868
Everybody dies!

01:28:55.528 --> 01:28:56.659
Calm down now.

01:28:57.129 --> 01:28:59.527
Where are your slippers? Look, your feet will get cold, won't they?

01:29:00.667 --> 01:29:02.198
I don't want my slippers!

01:29:02.422 --> 01:29:04.517
They're full of plutonium!

01:29:05.112 --> 01:29:07.445
Well that will just keep your feet warm, won't it?

01:29:07.910 --> 01:29:09.059
Let's get them on shall we?

01:29:11.854 --> 01:29:12.928
Everybody died!

01:29:13.165 --> 01:29:14.840
I know they did, they all died.

01:29:15.281 --> 01:29:15.974
They went kaboom!

01:29:16.171 --> 01:29:18.747
Yeah, they went kaboom. Let's get you up, shall we?

01:29:19.392 --> 01:29:20.416
There we go.

01:29:21.156 --> 01:29:21.980
One foot in.

01:29:23.457 --> 01:29:24.588
Toasty!

01:29:25.529 --> 01:29:28.254
I like toast. I like eating toast.

01:29:28.652 --> 01:29:29.277
Do you?

01:29:29.277 --> 01:29:29.880
Yeah.

01:29:30.284 --> 01:29:33.532
Nice and toasty, like everybody dying.

01:29:34.914 --> 01:29:36.428
Kaboom.

01:29:39.251 --> 01:29:40.441
Goodbye!
