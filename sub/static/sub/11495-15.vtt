00:07.117 --> 00:08.100
Hey, buddy.

00:08.282 --> 00:09.581
Hey, Dad.

00:09.583 --> 00:10.715
Long time no talk.

00:10.717 --> 00:12.017
I was starting to think
maybe you weren't

00:12.019 --> 00:13.151
a part of this family anymore.

00:13.153 --> 00:15.937
What? I'm not that easy
to get rid of.

00:15.939 --> 00:17.555
Just been really busy lately,
you know,

00:17.557 --> 00:19.441
spending a lot of time
with my girlfriend.

00:19.443 --> 00:22.360
Oh, please, tell me it's not
the 35-year-old single mother

00:22.362 --> 00:23.695
with the two kids.

00:23.697 --> 00:27.732
No, Tammy's 36,
and she has three kids.

00:27.734 --> 00:29.918
Jake, she's almost
twice your age.

00:29.920 --> 00:32.753
No, she's not; I'm 19.

00:32.756 --> 00:33.872
Geez, do the math.

00:33.874 --> 00:36.591
How well do you even know
this woman?

00:36.593 --> 00:38.376
Enough to know that I love her.

00:38.378 --> 00:39.744
Jake, slow down.
I'm just not sure

00:39.746 --> 00:41.379
that you know
what you're getting into.

00:41.381 --> 00:42.814
You always do this.

00:42.816 --> 00:44.766
You think every decision I make
is wrong.

00:44.768 --> 00:46.751
You're wrong about that.

00:46.753 --> 00:48.386
You've already made up your mind
about Tammy,

00:48.388 --> 00:49.587
and you don't even know her.

00:49.589 --> 00:50.972
Let me ask you this question.

00:50.974 --> 00:53.859
If you've never tasted
a strawberry ice cream cone

00:53.861 --> 00:56.278
in your life, how do you know
what it tastes like?

00:56.280 --> 00:58.029
What?

00:58.031 --> 01:01.283
My point is,
you've never licked Tammy.

01:06.205 --> 01:08.273
I don't know
how to respond to that.

01:08.275 --> 01:09.474
Yeah, you don't.

01:09.476 --> 01:10.826
She's delicious.

01:10.828 --> 01:13.278
Fine, why don't you bring her
up here so I can meet her.

01:13.280 --> 01:14.963
Okay, I will.
Good.

01:14.965 --> 01:16.164
I've got leave next weekend.

01:16.166 --> 01:17.249

Well, I've got Jake's room
all ready for this weekend.

02:01.196 --> 02:02.529
You know, just
out of curiosity,

02:02.531 --> 02:04.697
when are we going to stop
calling it "Jake's room"?

02:04.699 --> 02:06.666
'Cause I'd really like it to be
referred to as

02:06.668 --> 02:11.254
"Walden's gym"
or "Walden's home theater,"

02:11.256 --> 02:15.258
or "Walden's room to do whatever
the hell he wants with it."

02:15.260 --> 02:17.177
Look, I don't mean
to split hairs,

02:17.179 --> 02:20.096
but a room can't really be both
a gym and a home theater.

02:20.098 --> 02:22.382
That's why
I also need "Alan's room."

02:23.684 --> 02:24.768
Touché.

02:24.770 --> 02:27.554
Truthé.

02:27.556 --> 02:29.355
Will you stop
futzing with my desk?!

02:29.357 --> 02:30.774
I'm sorry, I'm
sorry, I'm just...

02:30.776 --> 02:32.375
I'm nervous about meeting
Jake's girlfriend.

02:32.377 --> 02:33.943
I mean,
he's obsessed with this woman.

02:33.945 --> 02:35.945
It's like he's been brainwashed
by some cult.

02:35.947 --> 02:37.981
What guy hasn't?

02:41.118 --> 02:42.902
I'm sorry, you said "cult."

02:46.874 --> 02:48.608
You're enjoying this,
aren't you?

02:48.610 --> 02:50.493
Yep, I got to get something
out of you living here.

02:50.495 --> 02:52.078
You don't pay rent.

02:53.481 --> 02:56.132
Listen, I think you're getting
all worked up over nothing.

02:56.134 --> 02:58.451
Nothing? She's 36 years old.

02:58.453 --> 02:59.586
So? I'm 34.

02:59.588 --> 03:01.054
Yeah, and I don't want you

03:01.056 --> 03:02.505
dating my son, either.

03:02.507 --> 03:04.340
Ouch.

03:05.660 --> 03:07.143
That's probably them.

03:07.145 --> 03:08.244
It can't be.

Tammy.

03:24.362 --> 03:25.778
Uh, Tammy, this is my dad, Alan.

03:25.780 --> 03:26.996
It's a pleasure
to meet you.

03:26.998 --> 03:28.198
Likewise.
Come in.

03:28.200 --> 03:29.799
Wow!

03:29.801 --> 03:31.751
Yeah, it would take
the jaws of life

03:31.753 --> 03:33.303
to get me out of this house.

03:33.305 --> 03:35.955
Look, you already have
something in common.

03:37.591 --> 03:38.608
I'm, uh, Walden Schmidt.

03:38.610 --> 03:41.327
Good God,
you're prettier than I am.

03:41.329 --> 03:43.429
That's quite the grip.

03:43.431 --> 03:46.933
Yeah. I milked cows
when I was a kid.

03:46.935 --> 03:48.685
Then I discovered boys.

03:50.037 --> 03:51.671
I'm just kidding.

03:51.673 --> 03:53.356
Not really.

03:54.608 --> 03:56.893
This really is an
amazing house though.

03:56.895 --> 03:58.061
Thank you.

03:58.063 --> 04:00.980
Be much nicer with
a home theater.

04:00.982 --> 04:03.066
But, uh, I've been
very fortunate.

04:03.068 --> 04:04.183
Yeah, so I've heard.

04:04.485 --> 04:06.702
Jake tells me
you're stupid rich.

04:07.838 --> 04:11.824
He tells me
you're very resourceful.

04:11.826 --> 04:14.627
I'll take that as a compliment.

04:14.629 --> 04:16.295
Please, make yourselves
at home. Have a seat.

04:16.297 --> 04:18.414
Is there anything I can
get you to eat or drink?

04:18.416 --> 04:19.982
Oh, I'd love a drink,

04:19.983 --> 04:22.185
but it would set off
my ankle bracelet.

04:23.670 --> 04:24.804
Not really.

04:24.806 --> 04:27.940
I got that sucker
off a week ago.

04:27.942 --> 04:29.275
You hear that, Walden?

04:29.277 --> 04:31.360
She just got
her ankle bracelet off.

04:31.362 --> 04:33.696
I don't see how this
could get any better.

04:33.698 --> 04:37.200
Oh, oh, oh!

04:37.202 --> 04:40.620
It just got better!

04:40.622 --> 04:42.705
Well... look at you.

04:43.857 --> 04:45.575
Uh, now,
where would a skull be going

04:45.577 --> 04:47.410
that he would
even need a top hat?

04:48.412 --> 04:49.879
Oh, he might be going
to visit Yosemite Sam.

04:49.881 --> 04:50.997
Mm.

04:50.999 --> 04:53.699
Yeah, they're kind
of my business cards.

04:53.701 --> 04:55.134
I own a tattoo parlor.

04:55.136 --> 04:56.719

04:56.721 --> 04:59.672

my name's
written right here.

05:14.889 --> 05:16.439
Nice.

one called?

05:20.161 --> 05:21.226

So, so, so, how'd
you two meet?

05:31.256 --> 05:33.089
Oh, Jake came
into my shop.

05:33.091 --> 05:34.123
Tammy's Tatties.

05:34.125 --> 05:35.541
Exactly. See, once
you get it in your head,

05:35.543 --> 05:36.676
you can't get it out.

05:36.678 --> 05:39.378
No, you cannot.

05:39.380 --> 05:41.297
Yeah, a couple of us
guys from the base

05:41.299 --> 05:43.082
went out drinking, and
they bet me 100 bucks

05:43.084 --> 05:45.217
that I wouldn't get
this tattoo of two arms

05:45.219 --> 05:46.936
coming out of
my butt crack.

05:46.938 --> 05:49.305
Like, you know, someone
was trying to escape.

05:49.307 --> 05:50.523
Oh, Jake, you didn't.

05:50.525 --> 05:52.558
No, Tammy
wouldn't let me.

05:52.560 --> 05:54.277
Damn right.
Thank you for that.

05:54.279 --> 05:55.778
I took one
look at his ass

05:55.780 --> 05:57.780
and I thought,
I don't want to tattoo that,

05:57.782 --> 05:59.765
I want to bite that.

Isn't Tammy awesome?

06:35.970 --> 06:39.338

you have to acknowledge

06:39.340 --> 06:40.823
that this is
an unusual relationship.

06:40.825 --> 06:43.242
I mean, she's old enough

why you're with Jake.

09:16.964 --> 09:20.182
I'm with him
because I care about him.

09:21.635 --> 09:24.320
I mean,
he's sweet and kind and funny.

09:25.755 --> 09:27.823
And I don't when
the last time you had sex

09:27.825 --> 09:31.110
with a 19-year-old boy was,
but it is a lot of fun.

09:32.195 --> 09:36.248
Then eight minutes later,
it's a lot of fun again.

09:36.250 --> 09:39.919
Um, I'll-I'll take
your word for it.

09:39.921 --> 09:41.954
Alan, has anybody ever
looked at you

09:41.956 --> 09:44.156
like you were the greatest thing
on the planet?

09:44.158 --> 09:46.142
Do strippers count?

09:46.144 --> 09:47.209
No.

09:47.211 --> 09:48.644
Then no.

09:48.646 --> 09:51.714
Well, that's the way
Jake looks at me.

09:53.383 --> 09:55.301
He thinks I can do no wrong,

09:55.303 --> 09:57.269
and he worships the ground
I walk on.

09:57.271 --> 10:00.756
Uh, to be fair, for a while,
he worshipped Twinkies.

10:00.758 --> 10:03.225
Yeah, yeah, he still does.

10:03.227 --> 10:05.811
But don't worry, I don't let him
have sugar past 9:00.

10:05.813 --> 10:07.279
Mm.

10:07.281 --> 10:09.982
The bottom line is,
I think your son is terrific.

10:11.501 --> 10:13.485
And I know what we have
isn't gonna last forever,

10:13.487 --> 10:15.654
but it's what I want in my life
right now.

10:16.640 --> 10:18.857
I'm really sorry
if you don't approve.

10:18.859 --> 10:21.243
Well, you have
to understand,

10:21.245 --> 10:23.863
Jake is still my...

10:23.865 --> 10:25.648
baby.

10:25.650 --> 10:26.882
I hear you.

10:26.884 --> 10:29.218

the judge

10:29.220 --> 10:32.087

my oldest son as an adult.

you and Tammy being together.

16:44.105 --> 16:45.188

we were to get married,

16:50.361 --> 16:51.994

whole family there--

you and your father.

17:16.971 --> 17:20.772

this from a different angle.

17:23.728 --> 17:26.112

17:28.682 --> 17:31.317
I think, before we do
anything else,

17:31.319 --> 17:33.486
you need to make things right
with your dad.

17:33.488 --> 17:35.371
I think he needs to make
things right with me.

17:35.373 --> 17:37.707
It doesn't matter
who takes the first step.

17:37.709 --> 17:39.876
Jake, he loves you,

17:39.878 --> 17:42.378
and that's not something
you can just throw away.

17:42.380 --> 17:45.248
But you're more important
to me than he is.

17:45.250 --> 17:47.750
Thank you.

17:48.802 --> 17:51.804
But family is the most
important thing in the world.

17:51.806 --> 17:54.807
That's why I make sure
my kids get to see their dad,

17:54.809 --> 17:56.375
even if he is
behind Plexiglas,

17:56.377 --> 17:58.728
wearing an orange jumpsuit.

17:59.897 --> 18:02.098
I can't believe
I'm not going to be there

18:02.100 --> 18:04.183

18:04.185 --> 18:06.018
Well, if it makes
you feel any better,

18:06.020 --> 18:08.521
I'm pretty sure you'll have
many more opportunities.

18:09.890 --> 18:11.891
I got married
in Vegas,

18:11.893 --> 18:14.076

18:14.078 --> 18:16.779

Yeah, yeah, I-I need
to talk to you, too.

18:22.020 --> 18:26.122
Um, I want to tell you
both that I'm sorry,

18:26.124 --> 18:28.674
um, that...

18:28.676 --> 18:32.728
if marrying Tammy is the
right thing for you...

18:32.730 --> 18:34.747
you have my love
and support.

18:34.749 --> 18:35.865
We're not getting married.

18:35.867 --> 18:38.134
Oh, thank God!

18:38.136 --> 18:39.936
Jake...

18:39.938 --> 18:41.637
I'm also sorry.

18:41.639 --> 18:42.805
You're dead to me.

18:42.807 --> 18:45.875
And your room's a home theater.

18:46.810 --> 18:48.394
W-What made you
change your mind?

18:48.396 --> 18:50.613
I just decided that I don't want
to get married

18:50.615 --> 18:53.783
unless you're going to be the
one to walk me down the aisle.

18:54.918 --> 18:56.953
A-Actually the dad
walks the, uh...

18:56.955 --> 18:57.936
Let it go.

18:57.938 --> 18:59.872
Right.

18:59.874 --> 19:01.490
I just-- I want
you to be happy.

19:01.492 --> 19:03.942
Thanks, and, you know, someday
we are going to get married,

19:03.944 --> 19:08.881
maybe get a dog or a leopard,
have a couple kids of our own--

19:08.883 --> 19:11.917
maybe more than a couple,
maybe, like, two or three.

19:21.161 --> 19:23.746
You're going to need
a bigger house.

19:23.748 --> 19:26.048
♪ <i>Men.</i> ♪

19:33.493 --> 19:35.010
♪ <i>Men.</i> ♪

19:35.012 --> 19:38.130
You know, this place
could really use a home gym.

19:39.015 --> 19:41.850
That's a good idea.

19:41.852 --> 19:44.419
Where could we put it?

19:45.839 --> 19:47.222
I've been, uh,
thinking about names

19:47.224 --> 19:49.224
for when Tammy and I have
our first kid.

19:50.278 --> 19:52.227
You're enjoying
this, aren't you?

19:52.229 --> 19:53.479
Yep.

19:53.481 --> 19:54.947
Although I-I am

19:54.949 --> 19:56.448
a little worried
about a third generation

19:56.450 --> 19:58.651
of freeloaders living here.

20:00.269 --> 20:02.705
If it's a boy, what do you think
about Walden Harper?

20:02.707 --> 20:05.074
I like it.
No.

20:05.076 --> 20:06.709
All right, then, I guess
it's down to either

20:06.711 --> 20:09.111
Alan or Xiang Xao.

20:09.113 --> 20:11.814
Xiang Xao?

20:11.816 --> 20:13.632
Yeah, I got to be ready, Dad.

20:13.634 --> 20:16.719
They say one out of every three
babies born is Chinese.

20:20.024 --> 20:22.374
I love it.
