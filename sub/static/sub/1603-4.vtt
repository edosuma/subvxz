LUCIOUS:
<i> Previously on</i> Empire...

00:03.804 --> 00:05.838
<i>Well, the police think they got</i>
<i> a witness for Bunkie's murder.</i>

00:05.840 --> 00:07.673
<i> I want to find out who it is.</i>
<i> Can you get on that?</i>

00:07.675 --> 00:10.009
Yes, sir. LUCIOUS:
Kidd Fo-Fo signed

00:10.011 --> 00:11.777
with Billy Beretti.
He is my enemy.

00:11.779 --> 00:14.446
Go after him.

00:14.448 --> 00:15.481
DOCTOR:
<i> You've got ALS.</i>

00:15.483 --> 00:16.782
There's no cure for that.

00:16.784 --> 00:17.816
Just want to have sex
with me now 'cause

00:17.818 --> 00:19.818
I'm a celebrity and all, huh?

00:19.820 --> 00:21.520
I want to keep them
together.

00:21.522 --> 00:23.288
What am I to you?
My mama.

00:23.290 --> 00:25.024
I don't understand you!

00:25.026 --> 00:26.392
You don't have to understand me.

00:26.394 --> 00:28.327
My obedience
is no longer for sale.

00:28.329 --> 00:30.162
MICHAEL: <i> You sure you want</i>
<i> to give everything up?</i>

00:30.164 --> 00:32.698
I'm going after his empire.
I'm gonna take it.

00:33.733 --> 00:36.735
I'm gonna ask you one more time:

00:36.737 --> 00:38.904
what do you want?

00:38.906 --> 00:40.739
I just told you.
We could shoot a music video,

00:40.741 --> 00:43.242
pop some bottles, get
some pretty girls,

00:43.244 --> 00:44.676
and then we can
get some gigs.

00:44.678 --> 00:45.911
You want to run Empire one day?

00:45.913 --> 00:47.746
'Cause that's not gonna cut it.

00:47.748 --> 00:49.481
At least I got songs.

00:49.483 --> 00:52.251
Jamal doesn't have
any new songs.

00:52.253 --> 00:53.685
He's so busy complaining

00:53.687 --> 00:55.521
about how life sucks
living in Bushwick

00:55.523 --> 00:57.022
'cause he cut himself off.

00:57.024 --> 00:58.490
Look, I'm not talking
about Jamal.

00:58.492 --> 01:00.392
I'm asking you,
what do you want?!

01:00.394 --> 01:01.727
ANIKA:
Lucious, let's just

01:01.729 --> 01:02.928
think about pushing
back the release date

01:02.930 --> 01:04.196
for the album, so...

01:04.198 --> 01:05.397
No, no, we're
not pushing

01:05.399 --> 01:06.598
back the
release date.

01:06.600 --> 01:07.866
His album drops

01:07.868 --> 01:09.401
the day that Empire goes public.

01:09.403 --> 01:11.236
Why are you riding
everybody so hard?

01:11.238 --> 01:12.738
Okay, let me
explain to y'all

01:12.740 --> 01:14.239
what I want.
I want...

01:14.241 --> 01:15.674
COOKIE:
Let me tell you what I want.

01:15.676 --> 01:16.708
What I want

01:16.710 --> 01:18.043
is a better office,

01:18.045 --> 01:20.112
not a broom closet
on the 13th floor,

01:20.114 --> 01:21.580
next to Accounting.

01:21.582 --> 01:23.682
And I would
also like to have

01:23.684 --> 01:26.752
full benefits
for my assistant here.

01:26.754 --> 01:28.454
BECKY: Sir, there's
nothing I can do.

01:28.456 --> 01:32.024
Homegirl gave HR a dead person's
social security number.

01:32.026 --> 01:33.692
Uh, sorry, but I don't do taxes.

01:33.694 --> 01:35.427
Look, Cookie,
I will work on

01:35.429 --> 01:37.262
getting you a
better office,

01:37.264 --> 01:38.564
but right now I need
you to leave mine

01:38.566 --> 01:39.798
so I can
do my job.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.400
Yeah, 'cause your
little Mally Mal,

01:41.402 --> 01:42.935
he need all the help
he can get right now.

01:42.937 --> 01:44.636
You know what?

01:44.638 --> 01:47.806
You need to stop rapping
like you're from the streets

01:47.808 --> 01:49.708
'cause you're not
'bout that life.

01:51.244 --> 01:53.812
You want to know why
"No Apologies" was so good?

01:53.814 --> 01:55.614
It was the best thing
you ever did

01:55.616 --> 01:57.749
because it was about Bunkie,

01:57.751 --> 02:00.052
and that was
real for you.

02:00.054 --> 02:01.420
You rapped from here.

02:01.422 --> 02:03.122
Stay there.

02:03.124 --> 02:04.690
(laughs quietly)

02:06.092 --> 02:07.893
Where's your office,
boo boo kitty?

02:07.895 --> 02:10.162
You know what? You need to just
put me on in her office.

02:10.164 --> 02:11.997
I know what Hakeem needs.

02:11.999 --> 02:13.765
And it's not some

02:13.767 --> 02:16.468
debutante
with a bougie ear

02:16.470 --> 02:19.238
who doesn't want
to disturb her pearls.

02:19.240 --> 02:21.106
What I want

02:21.108 --> 02:22.574
is for everyone

02:22.576 --> 02:25.277
to be talking about Empire

02:25.279 --> 02:26.912
until this IPO
is launched.

02:26.914 --> 02:28.514
What I want is
everyone talking

02:28.516 --> 02:29.815
about Hakeem.

02:29.817 --> 02:31.250
What I want most of all

02:31.252 --> 02:33.252
is for you to put
Donkey Kong in a barrel

02:33.254 --> 02:34.920
and get the hell
out of my office.

I didn't steal a damn thing.

02:43.430 --> 02:45.264

Hey.

02:58.646 --> 02:59.811
Hey, girl.

02:59.813 --> 03:01.146
This is the office
they gave you?

03:01.148 --> 03:02.614
Uh, it's temporary.

03:02.616 --> 03:03.815
That's wrong.

03:03.817 --> 03:05.717
What you want, Tiana?

03:05.719 --> 03:07.819
I was wondering if you could
listen to my new demo.

03:07.821 --> 03:10.455
If... you know, if
you're not busy.

03:10.457 --> 03:12.824
Porsha, get her
something to drink.

03:12.826 --> 03:14.826

(clears throat)

03:23.037 --> 03:25.971
Uh... why do you want me
to hear your song?

03:25.973 --> 03:28.040
Well, it needs something,

03:28.042 --> 03:30.008
and I just can't
figure out what it is.

03:30.010 --> 03:32.411
Why didn't you ask Anika
what it needs?

03:32.413 --> 03:33.912
She's a suit.

03:33.914 --> 03:37.382
And that song you pulled
for Jamal was dope.

03:37.384 --> 03:39.518
Is he, like,
your only client,

03:39.520 --> 03:40.686

with other people, too?

03:40.688 --> 03:42.521
Tiana, sweetheart,

03:42.523 --> 03:44.656
I own half this company.

03:44.658 --> 03:46.825
And I will be
moving out of

03:46.827 --> 03:48.427
this little
hellhole soon.

03:48.429 --> 03:49.828
Soon as

Lucious can remember
that I'm the one

03:53.400 --> 03:56.568
who deserves to be across
that hall from him.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.437
Let me hear this song.

03:58.439 --> 03:59.871
Yeah. It's called
"Keep It Movin'."

03:59.873 --> 04:01.540
The hook is good,

04:01.542 --> 04:03.742

This is a closed status meeting.

09:21.228 --> 09:23.528
Y'all clear on that?
We'll discuss this later.

09:23.530 --> 09:25.397
No, there's nothing
to discuss, sweetheart.

09:25.399 --> 09:29.234
Why don't you go to the studio?
I'll catch up. All right.

09:29.236 --> 09:32.470
With your fierce self. Y'all
wait to see what I do with her.

09:33.940 --> 09:36.074
Are we gonna have some problems?

09:36.076 --> 09:39.411
(scoffs)
Cookie...

09:39.413 --> 09:41.513
I don't have time
for this right now.

09:41.515 --> 09:43.415
I have to run a meeting.
If you want to stay,

09:43.417 --> 09:46.184
you stay. I don't
care what you do.

09:46.186 --> 09:49.287
Okay, well, then I will stay.

09:49.289 --> 09:50.722
Good morning,
everyone.

09:50.724 --> 09:53.692
Um, first order
of business.

09:53.694 --> 09:55.694
Kidd Fo-Fo-- we don't
have him anymore.

09:55.696 --> 09:57.696
No, good riddance.

09:57.698 --> 09:59.698
Did y'all a favor,
as far as I'm concerned.

09:59.700 --> 10:00.932
As I said,
Kidd Fo-Fo--

10:00.934 --> 10:03.702
he's not on our roster.

10:03.704 --> 10:06.605
So: who do we have,
who can we get,

10:06.607 --> 10:10.141
who's making noise, who's
filling up the hip-hop blogs?

10:10.143 --> 10:12.110
Titan, basically.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.712
Nobody else exists.

10:13.714 --> 10:15.146
He's making a fortune
for Creedmoor.

10:15.148 --> 10:17.048
Outselling
every genre.

10:17.050 --> 10:19.451
Yeah, but we don't have Titan,
so we need somebody else.

10:19.453 --> 10:22.220
Y-Y'all don't understand the
difference between the real deal

10:22.222 --> 10:25.390
and a poseur. Get some
authenticity up in here.

10:25.392 --> 10:27.759
We need somebody like Titan.

10:27.761 --> 10:29.227
I don't want

10:29.229 --> 10:30.795
someone
like Titan.

10:30.797 --> 10:34.532
The Empire wants Titan.

10:35.768 --> 10:36.901
Bring him here.

10:36.903 --> 10:38.770
Ms. Calhoun,
can I

10:38.772 --> 10:41.139
see you
for a second?

10:41.141 --> 10:44.909
Don't worry about it.
I'll take it from here.

10:44.911 --> 10:47.812
So, how do we go
about getting Titan?

10:47.814 --> 10:51.349
Now do you know why
I've been so hard on you?

10:51.351 --> 10:53.752
And been pushing
Hakeem so hard?

10:53.754 --> 10:56.454
I need my successor
positioned

10:56.456 --> 10:59.157
and I need our company to be
stronger than it's ever been.

10:59.159 --> 11:02.761
I need you
to be strong now.

11:02.763 --> 11:05.930
What does Titan have
to do with this?

11:05.932 --> 11:07.766
You heard them
in the A&R meeting-- he's...

11:07.768 --> 11:10.301
the most authentic artist
since Tupac.

11:10.303 --> 11:11.870
They're not talking
about Empire.

11:11.872 --> 11:13.471
They're talking about him.

11:13.473 --> 11:14.706
I know what I'm saying, baby.

11:14.708 --> 11:16.508
He's with Creedmoor.

11:16.510 --> 11:19.878
Well, that's our added bonus.

11:19.880 --> 11:22.113
Because if we poach
him from Creedmoor...

11:22.115 --> 11:23.548
That's a bullet

11:23.550 --> 11:25.183
to Beretti's head.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.619
You're right.

11:27.621 --> 11:29.821
That's brilliant.

11:29.823 --> 11:31.356
Okay.

11:31.358 --> 11:32.957
I'll sign him.

11:32.959 --> 11:35.060
No, no, no.
I told Vernon to handle this.

11:35.062 --> 11:37.829
Um, he's involved
in some gang beef,

11:37.831 --> 11:40.165
and it's just dangerous.

11:40.167 --> 11:42.901
Lucious, stop treating me
like I'm some damn baby doll.

11:42.903 --> 11:44.636
Nobody's treating you
like a baby. I'm treating you

11:44.638 --> 11:45.804
like you're my...
Yo, what's this I hear about

11:45.806 --> 11:46.905
you trying to steal an artist

11:46.907 --> 11:48.640
from a competing label?

11:48.642 --> 11:50.842
You watch your tone
in my office.

11:50.844 --> 11:54.179
Everyone... steals artists.

11:54.181 --> 11:55.980
Yeah, it's a part
of the game, baby.

11:55.982 --> 11:58.249
Not right before a
public stock offering.

11:58.251 --> 12:01.720
I'm obliged to caution against
unsavory business practices.

12:01.722 --> 12:03.655
Mr. Menchel's right, Dad.
Poaching a jailed thug?

12:03.657 --> 12:05.523
It just sends the wrong message.

12:05.525 --> 12:09.094
I tried to tell you cats this
is a potentially great PR move.

12:09.096 --> 12:11.196
Truth is we're not poaching him.

12:11.198 --> 12:13.231
We are saving his life.

12:13.233 --> 12:16.067
To me, it looks like payback
for Beretti stealing Kidd Fo-Fo.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.736
He didn't steal Kidd Fo-Fo.

12:17.738 --> 12:19.504
Lucious dropped him
'cause he's wack.

12:19.506 --> 12:20.872
Because he was
too controversial.

12:20.874 --> 12:22.540
No, because he wasn't
good enough.

12:22.542 --> 12:24.676
Look, Titan's

12:24.678 --> 12:27.779
narrative is real.
He needs to be here.

12:27.781 --> 12:29.914
Beretti is gonna
come back at us... hard.

12:29.916 --> 12:31.116
So? Let him.

12:31.118 --> 12:33.118
It's about time we kicked

12:33.120 --> 12:34.953
that fake-ass pimp to the curb.

12:34.955 --> 12:37.455
And Beretti, the last thing

12:37.457 --> 12:40.425
he's expecting us to do
is to hit back.

12:40.427 --> 12:43.561
He thinks we're gonna play nice
since we're launching the IPO.

12:43.563 --> 12:46.564
Vernon, when does Titan get out?

12:46.566 --> 12:47.599
That boy ain't getting out.

12:47.601 --> 12:49.434
He's on a no-bail hold.

12:49.436 --> 12:51.603
Previous gun charge.
Lawyers ain't doing jack.

12:51.605 --> 12:54.205
And his face is all over
magazines and Web sites.

12:54.207 --> 12:56.474
And Beretti is
still making money.

12:56.476 --> 12:59.711
I will go to BCC.

12:59.713 --> 13:01.880
(laughs)
Andre, can you check

13:01.882 --> 13:04.716
with your contact
at the mayor's office and see

13:04.718 --> 13:06.251
if she can get me
a private meeting?

13:06.253 --> 13:07.385
VERNON: Hey, baby girl,
you ain't going nowhere.

13:07.387 --> 13:08.887
These cats are real.

13:08.889 --> 13:10.288
And you can't handle that.
(laughs)

13:10.290 --> 13:12.590
This is the dumbest thing
I ever heard.

13:12.592 --> 13:15.426
Lucious, you really gonna send
this bougie debutante

13:15.428 --> 13:17.428
to the county jail?

13:17.430 --> 13:19.297
Man, are you stupid?

13:19.299 --> 13:20.498
VERNON: Ain't nobody
gonna touch Titan when

13:20.500 --> 13:21.933
he's in Brooklyn Correctional.

13:21.935 --> 13:23.902
He shot Cashville's
top drug dealer.

13:23.904 --> 13:26.171
These cats are fighting
over territory.

13:26.173 --> 13:27.672
They want revenge.

13:27.674 --> 13:28.740
LUCIOUS:
Vernon,

13:28.742 --> 13:30.675
I need you to set up a meeting

13:30.677 --> 13:33.812
for Anika and Titan's manager

13:33.814 --> 13:36.781
where she can slide him an offer
somewhere in their hood.

13:36.783 --> 13:38.349
I'll go with her
to make sure she's safe.

13:38.351 --> 13:40.819
And, Cookie, you're
gonna stay out of this.

13:40.821 --> 13:42.587
You know I can handle
this, Lucious.

13:42.589 --> 13:44.255
What you need to handle
is your client.

13:44.257 --> 13:45.857
I hear he's having
a little trouble

13:45.859 --> 13:47.692
since he's been waving
his little rainbow flag

13:47.694 --> 13:50.929
around, telling everybody
he doesn't need my money.

13:58.671 --> 14:00.305
I know y'all hungry.

14:00.307 --> 14:04.042
I figured your gas hadn't
been turned on yet.

14:04.044 --> 14:05.310
Hi, sweetheart.
Thank you, Cookie.

14:05.312 --> 14:06.978
You're so sweet.

14:06.980 --> 14:10.782
In the whole apartment
ain't enough plugs.

14:10.784 --> 14:12.884
I have to get a power strip.

14:12.886 --> 14:14.853
Well, here, buy some. Here.

14:14.855 --> 14:16.487
And while you're at it,
get some things

14:16.489 --> 14:18.022
and fix this place up.

14:18.024 --> 14:20.325
I know how y'all divas
like to decorate.

14:20.327 --> 14:22.527
Please get that out of my face.
That's Lucious' money.

14:22.529 --> 14:24.829
Suit yourself.

14:24.831 --> 14:26.164
All right, Jamal, you're hungry.
Come have some pizza.

14:26.166 --> 14:28.399
Do you want a slice, Cookie?
Uh-uh.

14:28.401 --> 14:29.968
You know, this place
ain't half as bad

14:29.970 --> 14:33.037
as where we lived in Philly.

14:33.039 --> 14:35.240
But me and your daddy still
made some number-one hits

14:35.242 --> 14:36.975
in there, we sure did.

14:36.977 --> 14:39.477
Shooting rats in
between takes and all.

14:39.479 --> 14:41.212
(laughs)

14:41.214 --> 14:43.047
So, what you got?

14:43.049 --> 14:45.550
My songs ain't ready yet.

14:45.552 --> 14:47.852
They ain't.
Mal, don't you play me.

14:47.854 --> 14:49.654
Now, I'm trying
to build something for us.

14:49.656 --> 14:52.690
I'm managing Tiana now,
and I'm going after

14:52.692 --> 14:54.726
somebody else, baby,
somebody big.

14:54.728 --> 14:57.929
Somebody who knows how to fight
for what they believe in.

14:57.931 --> 14:59.430
Well, I'm happy for you.

14:59.432 --> 15:00.899
And I hope you get
everything that you want.

15:00.901 --> 15:01.933
Mal, you're the one who wanted

15:01.935 --> 15:03.568
to make your own music, okay?

15:03.570 --> 15:05.503
That's fine,
but we don't have time

15:05.505 --> 15:07.672
for you to be having
some mental artsy...

15:07.674 --> 15:10.608
block brain fart,
whatever you having!

15:10.610 --> 15:12.744
I'm not.

15:14.079 --> 15:16.047
I'm not!

15:16.049 --> 15:17.448
Okay, well, listen.

15:17.450 --> 15:19.684
I need you to get
to work, baby, okay?

15:19.686 --> 15:22.787
I need you to make me
some music, okay?

15:22.789 --> 15:24.322
Now, pull yourself together!

15:28.093 --> 15:30.194
Man, you'd better get off my
couch doing that. Wow, come on.

15:30.196 --> 15:32.196
You got a $2 million
apartment for that.

15:32.198 --> 15:34.198
This is business. In
case you haven't noticed,

15:34.200 --> 15:35.733
it ain't bad
for business.

15:35.735 --> 15:37.568
There's a gazillion
tribute pages.

15:37.570 --> 15:39.237
We're known as TaKeem.
Well, TaKeem,

15:39.239 --> 15:42.240
we need you guys to find

15:42.242 --> 15:44.943
a duet to record together.

15:44.945 --> 15:47.211
Because I just closed a deal
with the Teen Choice Awards.

15:47.213 --> 15:50.381
What? They have agreed
that they want to shoot

15:50.383 --> 15:53.651
the Nomination Announcement
Concert at Laviticus.

15:53.653 --> 15:55.987
As you
can imagine,

15:55.989 --> 15:58.823
the hottest talent
is gonna be there.

15:58.825 --> 16:02.160
And we want the both of you
to be representing Empire.

16:02.162 --> 16:03.828
That's genius.
(chuckles)

16:03.830 --> 16:05.563
I'm not watering my music down
for no tweens.

16:05.565 --> 16:07.298
Can't be afraid

16:07.300 --> 16:10.902
of mass appeal, son. You hook
these little white kids early,

16:10.904 --> 16:12.737
you've got 'em loyal for life.
You really think

16:12.739 --> 16:14.138
I'm afraid of something, Dad?
If you're not prolific,

16:14.140 --> 16:16.741
Jamal's gonna catch up to you.

16:16.743 --> 16:18.242
Jamal would never do
a teen show.

16:18.244 --> 16:20.144
That's why he'll never
be as big as you.

16:20.146 --> 16:22.246
(chimes)
Exactly.

16:22.248 --> 16:24.515
Cookie's down,
so let's get it crackin'.

16:24.517 --> 16:25.817
Oh, you ran it
by Cookie?

16:25.819 --> 16:28.019
Of course I did.
She's my manager.

16:28.021 --> 16:29.587
Dad, I tried
to talk her out of it,

16:29.589 --> 16:32.156
but you know how... Let me
tell you something, TaKeem.

16:32.158 --> 16:35.259
I have worked very hard
on my relationships

16:35.261 --> 16:37.762
in order
to get this done for you.

16:37.764 --> 16:40.798
And I am not gonna be having
Cookie messing this up for me.

16:40.800 --> 16:43.501
She's not. She's stoked about it.
Okay. Well,

16:43.503 --> 16:46.838
what exactly did Cookie promise
you when you signed with her?

16:46.840 --> 16:48.840
To do the same thing
she's doing for Jamal--

16:48.842 --> 16:51.676
protect the music
and make me a star.

16:51.678 --> 16:53.111
The same
thing

16:53.113 --> 16:55.213
she did for you back in the day,
right?

16:55.215 --> 16:57.048
Touché.

16:57.050 --> 16:58.783
(chuckles)

17:06.558 --> 17:08.659
As-salaam alaikum, my sister.

17:08.661 --> 17:10.028
Wa alaikum as-salaam.

17:10.030 --> 17:12.630
Um, I need to speak
to Sister Fatima

17:12.632 --> 17:14.799
regarding her son, Titan.

17:17.736 --> 17:20.738
I know your story, Sister.
Very well.

17:20.740 --> 17:22.073
I've followed you.

17:22.075 --> 17:24.509
They rip our families apart,

17:24.511 --> 17:27.512
and they lock up our strongest,
trying to keep us weak,

17:27.514 --> 17:29.213
killing us at the root.

17:29.215 --> 17:32.650
I missed my babies so much.
Thank you.

17:32.652 --> 17:34.986
Some, uh, Nation sisters
led prayer in lockup.

17:34.988 --> 17:38.823
Yeah, they helped me keep
my spirit intact.

17:38.825 --> 17:40.825
You must be happy
to be back home.

17:40.827 --> 17:42.727
(chuckles)

17:42.729 --> 17:46.397
I'm back, but I ain't home.

17:46.399 --> 17:50.168
I fall asleep now just as
lonely as I was on that cot.

17:50.170 --> 17:52.103
All those years,

17:52.105 --> 17:56.441
the thought of me holding my own
again gave me so much peace.

17:56.443 --> 17:58.209
(chuckles)

17:58.211 --> 18:00.044
But here I am.

18:00.046 --> 18:02.547
My husband left me.

18:02.549 --> 18:05.716
My oldest is too ashamed.

18:05.718 --> 18:08.386
My youngest don't even remember.

18:08.388 --> 18:10.421
FATIMA: I feel
your pain, Sister.

18:10.423 --> 18:12.423
You gave up your best years
for them kids,

18:12.425 --> 18:14.425
and now you have
to beg their forgiveness

18:14.427 --> 18:17.361
for the sacrifice you made?
It's not fair.

18:17.363 --> 18:20.298
But it's called being a mother,
ain't it?

18:20.300 --> 18:23.267
Yes, indeedy.

18:23.269 --> 18:25.269
Is Titan your only?

18:25.271 --> 18:28.106
FATIMA: (chuckles)
He's the provider. The youngest.

18:28.108 --> 18:30.308
You know, I tell people

18:30.310 --> 18:32.777
Allah saved the best for last.

18:32.779 --> 18:34.545
Yeah, my youngest
is talented, too.

18:34.547 --> 18:36.280
Strong-willed.

18:36.282 --> 18:39.217
I fear for him.

18:39.219 --> 18:40.885
My son protected himself.

18:40.887 --> 18:42.720
That animal that he shot

18:42.722 --> 18:45.590
burned down our community center
the night before.

18:45.592 --> 18:47.758
Titan went there
every day after school.

18:47.760 --> 18:49.160
He learned music
at that center.

18:49.162 --> 18:51.996
Kept him off the streets.

18:51.998 --> 18:54.832
Yeah, well, you...
you raised a good son.

18:54.834 --> 18:57.668
But from seeing
his videos,

18:57.670 --> 19:00.505
he ain't following the
Nation anymore, is he?

19:00.507 --> 19:01.906
Billy Beretti lured him.

19:01.908 --> 19:04.475
If he had stayed
with the Nation,

19:04.477 --> 19:06.410
he wouldn't be in jail.

19:06.412 --> 19:08.246
Look, Sister,

19:08.248 --> 19:12.350
Lucious Lyon's got an army
of lawyers and he wants to help.

19:14.253 --> 19:16.787
LUCIOUS: <i> I didn't write this.
</i> VERNON:<i> Of course</i>

19:16.789 --> 19:18.422
you didn't write it. Legal wrote it.
We sound smart

19:18.424 --> 19:20.525
as wack. BECKY: Come on
in, but Lucious only has

19:20.527 --> 19:21.759
five minutes. Okay?
I'm amazed by these.

19:21.761 --> 19:23.027
VERNON:
Legal did a good job.

19:23.029 --> 19:25.863
Ah, Detective Walker.
Good to see you.

19:25.865 --> 19:28.499
Thanks for squeezing me in, Mr.
Lyon. I understand

19:28.501 --> 19:30.101
you found Bunkie's car.
Uh, yeah.

19:30.103 --> 19:31.836
We found trace evidence
in the vehicle,

19:31.838 --> 19:34.972
so I'm obliged
to ask you all some questions.

19:34.974 --> 19:36.774
How often

19:36.776 --> 19:39.443
did you travel in his car?
Well, as...

19:39.445 --> 19:42.280
Maybe a couple times a week,
whenever we needed to talk.

19:42.282 --> 19:45.683
We all rode in his car. Yeah,
that's what I figured, but, um,

19:45.685 --> 19:48.819
we think Bunkie was shot
around 9:30 on the 12th.

19:48.821 --> 19:50.188
Do you recall

19:50.190 --> 19:51.756
where you were at that time?

20:00.632 --> 20:03.367
Probably have to check
with Becky, but I'm...

20:03.369 --> 20:05.269
sure I was home.

20:08.874 --> 20:10.208
You were at home?

20:10.210 --> 20:11.742
Yeah.

20:11.744 --> 20:13.010
Alone?

20:13.012 --> 20:15.546
I have 15 maids.

Is there a problem?

21:06.366 --> 21:08.432
OFFICER: We just need to
take a quick look around.

21:08.434 --> 21:11.969
Is that your boy?
That's my son Andre.

21:11.971 --> 21:13.871
Yeah, we were together
at his house watching the, uh,

21:13.873 --> 21:16.374
Mayweather fight.

21:16.376 --> 21:18.209
If you can call that
a fight. (chuckles)

21:18.211 --> 21:19.977
OFFICER:
Fan out and check it.

21:19.979 --> 21:21.212
All right, let's move.

21:21.214 --> 21:24.048
(indistinct chatter)

21:26.551 --> 21:28.085
How you doing, Andre?

21:28.087 --> 21:29.920
I had one too many. I spent
the night in your guest room.

21:29.922 --> 21:32.890
(chuckles)
I was there.

21:38.230 --> 21:40.464
You okay?

21:40.466 --> 21:42.199
Yes.

21:43.969 --> 21:45.803
Are you?

21:52.411 --> 21:53.878
All right.

22:04.856 --> 22:06.490
I understand that you're more
than Titan's managers.

22:06.492 --> 22:07.925
You're blood cousins?

22:07.927 --> 22:09.460
We grew up with him.

22:09.462 --> 22:11.128
Over in Marcy.

22:11.130 --> 22:12.830
Your beats inspired us, man.

22:12.832 --> 22:13.864
<i> Bueno.</i>

22:13.866 --> 22:15.766
For real, bro.
Appreciate that.

22:15.768 --> 22:17.802
Titan used to copy all your
rhymes when we were kids.

22:17.804 --> 22:19.804
That's how he
got started.

22:19.806 --> 22:21.872
Which is exactly why
he should be with Empire.

22:25.277 --> 22:27.812
Hey, look, um, yo, fellas,
want something to drink?

22:27.814 --> 22:29.980
Um, two black
and rums.

22:29.982 --> 22:32.016
Can I get a Scotch?
You take care of this.

22:34.119 --> 22:36.620
You know, in case
you were unaware,

22:36.622 --> 22:39.557
I am the head of A&R
for this company.

22:39.559 --> 22:41.559
Not his assistant.

22:41.561 --> 22:43.561
My bad.

22:43.563 --> 22:46.497
BRICK: Look,
baby girl, bottom line--

22:46.499 --> 22:48.499
Beretti got muscle
over at BC-squared.

22:48.501 --> 22:51.001
We ain't talked to Titan since
the night he got locked up.

22:51.003 --> 22:52.903
Oh, yeah, it's deep.

22:52.905 --> 22:54.171
Our boy shot
a Cashville gangster.

22:54.173 --> 22:55.206
(tires squeal)

22:55.208 --> 22:56.640
Get down,
they're clapping! Drive-by!

22:56.642 --> 22:58.042

Anika screams)

22:59.978 --> 23:02.246
Stay down! Stay down!

23:04.216 --> 23:06.217
I can't have you
around these people.

23:06.219 --> 23:08.219
Baby, I got
this, okay?

23:08.221 --> 23:09.387
I'll find another way... No.

23:09.389 --> 23:10.654
No, I will find
another way.

23:10.656 --> 23:11.722
You stay out of it.

23:16.094 --> 23:17.762
COOKIE:
<i> I went to see Titan's mother.</i>

23:17.764 --> 23:19.196
Did you?

23:19.198 --> 23:20.231
Yeah, she's serious, Lucious.

23:20.233 --> 23:22.666
I mean, bean pie, prayer rug,

23:22.668 --> 23:25.403
covered hair,
all of that, serious.

23:25.405 --> 23:28.005
She raised Titan
in the Nation of Islam.

23:28.007 --> 23:30.775
Titan is a part of the Fruit?

23:30.777 --> 23:32.276
Yeah, that's what
I'm telling you.

23:32.278 --> 23:34.712
(sighs)

23:34.714 --> 23:37.014
Nothing but
racist views.

23:37.016 --> 23:38.215
And?

23:38.217 --> 23:40.217
So is America.

23:40.219 --> 23:42.686
Every day, I worry
about my sons, don't you?

23:42.688 --> 23:44.688
I know how bad
you wanted Titan,

23:44.690 --> 23:47.057
but they're gonna break
his ass in prison.

23:47.059 --> 23:50.761
You lose your soul when you feel
like the world's forgotten you.

23:50.763 --> 23:52.963
I never forgot
about you.

23:54.566 --> 23:56.033
Couldn't.

23:56.035 --> 23:58.869
I did some things
that I had to do

23:58.871 --> 24:00.871
in order to make sure
that when you got out,

24:00.873 --> 24:02.606
you would have
all of this stuff.

24:02.608 --> 24:05.276
"This stuff," meaning
this material stuff?

24:06.611 --> 24:08.078
You just
stopped coming.

24:08.080 --> 24:11.582
No calls, no letter,
no explanation,

24:11.584 --> 24:14.885
just left me twisting
in the wind.

24:16.488 --> 24:18.489
(chuckles)

24:18.491 --> 24:20.057
Remember our first
Christmas?

24:20.059 --> 24:22.059
(chuckles)

24:22.061 --> 24:24.061
It was cold.

24:24.063 --> 24:26.464
We didn't have nothing,
we didn't need anything.

24:26.466 --> 24:28.265
You wrote me a song.

24:28.267 --> 24:30.568
(chuckles) You tried to get
me to steal a Christmas tree.

24:30.570 --> 24:31.802
Yeah, and you
punked out.

24:31.804 --> 24:32.970
(chuckles)

24:32.972 --> 24:34.839
I made inroads.

24:34.841 --> 24:37.475
I'm-a go back
and talk to Titan's mother.

24:37.477 --> 24:40.144
I think I can get her
to see the light.

24:42.080 --> 24:43.814
But getting in bed
with Titan means

24:43.816 --> 24:45.449
inviting the Nation
back into your life.

24:45.451 --> 24:46.951
Doesn't matter.

24:46.953 --> 24:49.687
I mean, this is business,
it's not personal.

24:49.689 --> 24:51.822
The Nation killed
your father.

24:54.593 --> 24:57.661
Just let me know if you want me
to go talk to his mother.

25:00.031 --> 25:02.333
You know, I never
forgot about you.

25:44.143 --> 25:45.543
So you're gonna
rerecord this.

25:45.545 --> 25:46.977
You're gonna go
to her house,

Tiana will be waiting

Hakeem, I can't make
you love your mother,

25:58.257 --> 26:00.691
but you will
respect her.

26:00.693 --> 26:02.593
Because she's lived
through a hell

26:02.595 --> 26:04.662
that you have
to understand

26:04.664 --> 26:06.664
if your music is
ever gonna elevate

26:06.666 --> 26:08.232
to the place of poetry

26:08.234 --> 26:11.168
where it resonates in the
hearts of its listeners.

26:11.170 --> 26:13.170

26:14.673 --> 26:16.740
Yeah, like Titan.

26:29.789 --> 26:31.789
Yeah, it's
disgusting.

26:31.791 --> 26:33.524
It's noisy as hell.

26:33.526 --> 26:35.259
Finding it hard to
work there, huh?

26:35.261 --> 26:36.293
Impossible.

26:37.796 --> 26:40.230
Well, you know nothing's
changed for me, man.

at Laviticus.

26:52.778 --> 26:54.111
He needed me,

26:54.113 --> 26:55.112

28:39.085 --> 28:42.519
Speaking of
the devil...

28:42.521 --> 28:43.921
Is that Beretti?

28:43.923 --> 28:45.689
(Lucious laughs)

28:45.691 --> 28:47.191
Hey, no, no, no.

28:47.193 --> 28:48.692
Jay, let him in. Let him in.

28:48.694 --> 28:50.060
Him and his girlfriend.

28:50.062 --> 28:52.196
Is that you
plus one?

28:52.198 --> 28:54.631
♪ ♪

28:57.235 --> 28:59.336
Wow.

29:01.272 --> 29:04.441
It's been a long time.

29:10.882 --> 29:13.751
So, your big mama
helped raise you?

29:13.753 --> 29:15.452
Big Mama was real strict.

29:15.454 --> 29:17.521
It explains
the good head on your shoulders.

29:17.523 --> 29:20.057
I always wanted
to raise a daughter.

29:20.059 --> 29:22.126
Hakeem's really lucky
to have you back.

29:22.128 --> 29:25.729
I was about your age
when I met Lucious.

29:25.731 --> 29:26.563
Really?

29:26.565 --> 29:28.098
Mm-hmm.

29:28.100 --> 29:30.367
He was freestyling down
on the corner of 23rd.

29:30.369 --> 29:33.036
Uh-huh. I started
doing the Wop.

29:33.038 --> 29:34.772
You don't even
know what that is.

29:34.774 --> 29:36.206
He tried to outdance me, girl.

29:36.208 --> 29:38.242
Next thing I know,
we got three sons.

29:38.244 --> 29:40.644
(both laugh)

29:40.646 --> 29:43.080
Where is Hakeem?

29:43.082 --> 29:45.282
He's always been late.

29:45.284 --> 29:47.084
Let's eat these dumplings
before they turn.

29:47.086 --> 29:50.254
Okay.

29:50.256 --> 29:53.390
I have tried to find it
in my heart to forgive you.

29:53.392 --> 29:55.793
To forgive me?

29:57.562 --> 30:01.665
You were the one
that broke the trust between us.

30:01.667 --> 30:05.469
That's why I left you. That's the
whole story. No, the whole story

30:05.471 --> 30:08.105
is, without me, you'd still be
selling CDs out of the trunk

30:08.107 --> 30:11.141
of your car. The whole
story is, without me,

30:11.143 --> 30:14.077
you don't have the maid
to look after your sons.

30:14.079 --> 30:15.779
You don't get into the studio.

30:15.781 --> 30:17.481
You don't have me
shape the album.

30:17.483 --> 30:18.849
Did you write

30:18.851 --> 30:20.584
one lyric on that album?

30:20.586 --> 30:23.120
No. Or play a single note?
Was it you

30:23.122 --> 30:26.590
that performed it all around
this planet and made it famous?

30:26.592 --> 30:29.927
No, but you saw fit
to put your name on my words

30:29.929 --> 30:30.961
without even
consulting me.

30:30.963 --> 30:32.830
You know how I found out?

30:32.832 --> 30:36.466
I was looking at the cover
of my CD and read the credits.

30:36.468 --> 30:38.468
You're not an artist, Bill.

30:38.470 --> 30:40.137
I don't care how many

30:40.139 --> 30:42.206
artists you steal from

30:42.208 --> 30:44.341
by putting your name
on their credits.

30:44.343 --> 30:48.178
You will never be an artist.

30:56.654 --> 30:58.222
(laughs)

30:58.224 --> 31:00.791
Let me ask
you something.

31:00.793 --> 31:03.527
Being a designer...

31:03.529 --> 31:05.362
When you're out there
doing your thing,

31:05.364 --> 31:07.397
do people try to
put you in a box?

31:07.399 --> 31:09.700
Especially when you're bringing
your new game.

31:09.702 --> 31:11.201
People are threatened.

31:11.203 --> 31:12.703
The more talent you have,

31:12.705 --> 31:15.072
the more they're gonna
keep you in a box.

31:15.074 --> 31:17.007
That's exactly what
they're trying to do.

31:17.009 --> 31:19.843
Everybody want me to be
what they want me to be.

31:19.845 --> 31:21.812
It's not gonna happen.

31:21.814 --> 31:24.014
There's a book
I'm gonna give to you.

31:24.016 --> 31:25.582
Yeah?

31:25.584 --> 31:27.317
I read it
when the industry tried

31:27.319 --> 31:29.553
to savage
my 2009 spring collection,

31:29.555 --> 31:31.889
and it changed
everything for me.

31:31.891 --> 31:34.925
It's called
<i> 48 Laws of Power.</i>

31:34.927 --> 31:36.693
Hey.

31:36.695 --> 31:38.695
Oh... You're such a douche bag.

31:38.697 --> 31:41.164
Your mother went through a lot
trying to make us dinner.

31:49.207 --> 31:50.908
I can't believe
you gave that little girl

31:50.910 --> 31:52.676
the keys
to your apartment, Hakeem.

31:52.678 --> 31:54.778
Amateur mistake.

31:54.780 --> 31:56.713
I'll make you a deal, Bill.

31:56.715 --> 31:59.583
If you promise
not to exploit Titan,

31:59.585 --> 32:00.918
I won't steal him from you.

32:00.920 --> 32:02.786
You're a powerful man, Bill.

32:02.788 --> 32:05.589
You can use your power
to help him get out of prison

32:05.591 --> 32:07.591
instead of letting him
twist in the wind

32:07.593 --> 32:10.027
while you capitalize
off of his, um...

32:10.029 --> 32:11.461
Misfortune.

32:11.463 --> 32:13.130
Yeah, his misfortune.

32:13.132 --> 32:16.033
I'm not here to negotiate
with you.

32:16.035 --> 32:17.634
What the hell are you here for?

32:17.636 --> 32:19.202
Give me my music back?

32:19.204 --> 32:21.238
Only when I stop
making money from it.

32:21.240 --> 32:23.373
Good for you.

32:23.375 --> 32:27.277
I'm here to tell you
not to go public.

32:27.279 --> 32:28.946
I'm here to tell you:

32:28.948 --> 32:31.415
cancel your IPO.

32:31.417 --> 32:33.417
Or what?

32:33.419 --> 32:34.785
BILLY:
If you go through with it,

32:34.787 --> 32:37.921
I will dig up the dirt
of your past

32:37.923 --> 32:42.392
and bury your Empire
and everyone in it.

32:44.996 --> 32:48.565
And I think I'm gonna
change the name of this place.

32:48.567 --> 32:50.567
I'm gonna call it Cookie's.

32:52.170 --> 32:54.404
VERNON: Get your ass
out of here, Beretti.

32:54.406 --> 32:55.706
Bye, Bill.

32:58.176 --> 33:00.243
(laughing)

33:01.446 --> 33:03.613
I've changed my mind.

33:03.615 --> 33:07.084
I'm gonna go visit Titan
in the prison tomorrow.

33:07.086 --> 33:10.320
I'm about to decimate
Beretti's ass.

33:15.360 --> 33:17.094
Ew!
Get it.

33:17.096 --> 33:19.096
Tiana gonna go ape
when she see me.

33:19.098 --> 33:20.964
I ain't even gonna make it
through sound check.

33:20.966 --> 33:22.699
Yeah, but you got to go
to sound check, Hakeem.

33:22.701 --> 33:23.767
You've got to be professional.

33:23.769 --> 33:25.469
(groans)
If Tiana pops off

33:25.471 --> 33:27.104
and acts crazy and messes
things up, then that's

33:27.106 --> 33:29.106
her problem with
her dumb ass.

33:29.108 --> 33:31.208
Dad can't blame you
for nothing.

33:31.210 --> 33:34.277

33:39.885 --> 33:41.518
it sounds even worse.

33:41.520 --> 33:44.988

Hell, no.

thumping) Hey, uh, listen.

33:48.060 --> 33:51.328

I'm cool with that.

34:44.183 --> 34:46.249
What I'm not cool with is

37:59.378 --> 38:01.278
Nobody getting in here tonight.

38:03.648 --> 38:05.749
I'm here to
see Titan.

38:05.751 --> 38:07.717
(panting):
What?

38:07.719 --> 38:09.753
(laughs):
Hey, y-you're my idol, man.

38:09.755 --> 38:11.054
Hey, um...

38:11.056 --> 38:12.255
uh, hold up, hold up.

38:12.257 --> 38:13.723
Dude, you are not gonna believe

38:13.725 --> 38:15.425
who just rocked up here, man--

38:15.427 --> 38:16.593
Lucious freakin' Lyon.

38:16.595 --> 38:18.128
You can call me Lucious,
Officer.

38:18.130 --> 38:20.797
Yes, sir.
Mr. Lucious, sir, I, uh...

38:20.799 --> 38:23.266
I can escort you in, but, uh...

38:23.268 --> 38:24.734
only you, sir.

38:26.103 --> 38:28.605
It's cool.

38:28.607 --> 38:29.939
(door buzzes)
Thank you, Officer.

38:29.941 --> 38:31.441
No problem. Uh, this way.

38:31.443 --> 38:33.810
Officer. Officer.

38:39.684 --> 38:42.252
My mama always told me the music
business wasn't nothing but the devil.

38:42.254 --> 38:44.321
Beretti was the devil.

38:44.323 --> 38:46.423
I see the devil in you.

38:46.425 --> 38:49.926
You lost your soul a long time ago.
Yeah.

38:49.928 --> 38:51.594
Maybe.

38:51.596 --> 38:55.265
Maybe I lost my soul.

38:55.267 --> 38:58.935
But... I've lived through
some hard times, man.

38:58.937 --> 39:00.870
You've seen a man die?

39:03.808 --> 39:05.408
You kill him?

39:07.778 --> 39:09.179
(exhales)

39:09.181 --> 39:12.015
If you stay with Beretti
long enough...

39:14.518 --> 39:17.787
...you'll sell your soul to him.

39:17.789 --> 39:19.155
After...

39:19.157 --> 39:22.459
he's robbed you
and broken you...

39:22.461 --> 39:25.028
like he tried to do to me.

39:25.030 --> 39:26.196
He stole from you, too?

39:26.198 --> 39:28.164
Robbed me of millions.
(laughs)

39:28.166 --> 39:31.301
So you want to use me
to get back at him, right?

39:31.303 --> 39:33.470
I heard that beef you had
with Cashville backstage

39:33.472 --> 39:35.372
was about him

39:35.374 --> 39:37.640
burning down your
community center.

39:37.642 --> 39:39.909
I made some
of my first demos there.

39:39.911 --> 39:42.145
That's what your mama said.

39:42.147 --> 39:44.214
One point seven.

39:44.216 --> 39:45.849
What?

39:45.851 --> 39:48.585
One point...

39:48.587 --> 39:50.687
seven million, right?

39:50.689 --> 39:54.391
That was the amount it'll cost
to rebuild the center.

39:54.393 --> 39:58.862
I cut a check for that and your
signing bonus this morning.

39:58.864 --> 40:01.731
So you want to help the Nation?
No. Never.

40:01.733 --> 40:05.201
But it's your money-- you
do with it as you choose.

40:05.203 --> 40:07.270
But if I was you, I would...

40:07.272 --> 40:10.440
rebuild the center
and put a studio in there,

40:10.442 --> 40:12.509
naming it after myself...

40:12.511 --> 40:14.778
so I could protect my legacy.
