WEBVTT

00:02.905 --> 00:04.338
<i>Well, there you have it, America. </i>

00:04.406 --> 00:09.070
<i>Tonight, we saw Ethan Williams</i>
<i>sing his heart out with Shakira</i>

00:09.144 --> 00:10.907
<i>and win his own recording contract. </i>

00:10.979 --> 00:12.105
<i>Give him a hand. </i>

00:13.348 --> 00:16.146
<i>Congratulations, Ethan. </i>
<i>We'll see you after the show. </i>

00:16.218 --> 00:19.016
<i>Which means we have to say goodbye</i>
<i>to these two adorable kids</i>

00:19.088 --> 00:21.318
<i>who really have</i>
<i>a fine career ahead of them</i>

00:21.390 --> 00:24.553
<i>as long as it doesn't involve singing. </i>

00:24.626 --> 00:27.789
<i>And I mean it, guys. </i>
<i>Not even</i> Happy Birthday.

00:30.699 --> 00:32.360
<i>Next week on</i> Singing With The Stars,

00:32.433 --> 00:34.425
<i>three new hopefuls</i>
<i>get their shot at a record deal</i>

00:34.503 --> 00:37.802
<i>and a chance to sing</i>
<i>with this teen pop sensation. </i>

00:37.873 --> 00:39.306
<i>Who is she?</i>

00:39.374 --> 00:41.399
<i>Hey, get up</i>

00:41.477 --> 00:43.502
<i>Me! Hannah Montana!</i>

00:45.881 --> 00:49.044
<i>See you all next week,</i>
<i>and we'll really pump up the party!</i>

00:49.118 --> 00:52.349
<i>Hey, get up</i>

00:52.421 --> 00:54.286
<i>Get loud</i>

00:54.389 --> 00:57.449
<i>Start pumpin' up the party now</i>

01:02.564 --> 01:04.759
I can't believe
you're gonna be the celebrity singer

01:04.833 --> 01:06.357
on <i>Singing With The Stars. </i>

01:06.435 --> 01:10.269
That makes Hannah Montana
just about the coolest person ever!

01:17.179 --> 01:19.238
- Must be you.
- Must be you.

01:20.082 --> 01:21.413
Guys, bad news.

01:21.483 --> 01:24.452
Amber and Ashley's
annual Cool List is out again.

01:24.520 --> 01:25.782
Well, that explains it.

01:25.854 --> 01:28.618
How far down
did they put us this year?

01:28.690 --> 01:31.955
Keep going. Keep going.

01:32.027 --> 01:34.461
Keep... Just skip to the last page.

01:34.530 --> 01:37.658
Oh, we're tied for dead last
with Dandruff Danny.

01:39.268 --> 01:41.702
Is someone actually talking to me?

01:43.572 --> 01:45.437
Look away, look away!

01:46.575 --> 01:48.372
- Okay, see you later.
- Where are you going?

01:48.443 --> 01:50.502
Look, I finally cracked the top 100.

01:50.579 --> 01:53.707
And there's no way I'm talking
to people from the last page.

01:53.782 --> 01:55.374
Stop begging.

01:56.785 --> 01:58.412
I'll see you after dark.

01:58.487 --> 02:02.150
That boy flip flops more than
a catfish in a moon bouncer.

02:04.059 --> 02:06.027
Oh, hey, look, everyone,

02:06.094 --> 02:09.928
it's a couple of last page losers
in their native habitat.

02:09.997 --> 02:15.368
So sad. Still eating.
As if they had a reason to live.

02:16.572 --> 02:18.540
Okay, that's it. Listen.

02:18.607 --> 02:21.906
This list is as bogus
as the people who wrote it.

02:21.977 --> 02:23.069
Come on, everyone!

02:23.145 --> 02:24.476
Let's show Amber and Ashley

02:24.546 --> 02:26.673
that they can't tell us
who's cool and who's not!

02:26.748 --> 02:29.410
Let's rip up these lists right now!

02:35.390 --> 02:36.948
Miley?

02:37.025 --> 02:39.721
I'm the only one doing it, aren't I?

02:39.795 --> 02:41.729
I'm with you, sister!

02:46.702 --> 02:48.602
How is he not below us?

02:56.645 --> 02:58.112
<i> Come on!</i>

02:58.180 --> 03:02.173
<i>You get the limo out front</i>

03:02.251 --> 03:05.743
<i>Hottest styles, every shoe, every color</i>

03:05.821 --> 03:09.416
<i>Yeah, when you're famous</i>
<i>it can be kind of fun</i>

03:09.491 --> 03:14.588
<i>It's really you</i>
<i>but no one ever discovers</i>

03:14.663 --> 03:17.928
<i>Who would have thought</i>
<i>that a girl like me</i>

03:18.000 --> 03:23.165
<i>Would double as a superstar?</i>

03:23.238 --> 03:27.368
<i>You get the best of both worlds</i>

03:27.442 --> 03:29.273
<i>Chill it out, take it slow</i>

03:29.344 --> 03:30.971
<i>Then you rock out the show</i>

03:31.046 --> 03:35.483
<i>You get the best of both worlds</i>

03:35.550 --> 03:36.949
<i>Mix it all together</i>

03:37.019 --> 03:40.318
<i>And you know that</i>
<i>it's the best of both worlds</i>

03:44.760 --> 03:47.320
So, maybe some people
care about the list.

03:47.396 --> 03:49.261
But there are plenty
of other decent people

03:49.331 --> 03:50.958
strong enough to think for themselves,

03:51.033 --> 03:54.025
and those are the people
I want for my friends anyways.

03:54.102 --> 03:55.569
Like Sarah.

03:56.338 --> 03:59.637
- Hey, Sarah.
- Oh, hi, guys.

03:59.708 --> 04:03.303
Listen, Miley, I'm really sorry
but I can't be your lab partner.

04:03.378 --> 04:06.370
Today after school
I have to read to the blind,

04:06.448 --> 04:08.382
serve punch at the blood drive

04:08.450 --> 04:11.317
and hose down cages
at the animal shelter.

04:12.187 --> 04:15.281
Wait a minute,
you read to the blind yesterday.

04:16.291 --> 04:18.521
I took an extra shift.

04:19.827 --> 04:22.262
Extra shift, my Aunt Petunia!

04:23.465 --> 04:26.434
You're just bailing on me because
I'm last on Amber and Ashley's list.

04:26.501 --> 04:28.492
- Aren't you?
- No, I'm not.

04:28.570 --> 04:32.301
Oh, no, here comes Amber.
Sorry, I'm charitable, not stupid.

04:32.374 --> 04:33.705
Okay, bye.

04:35.077 --> 04:37.910
Great, even Saint Sarah
is freezing us out!

04:38.647 --> 04:40.581
But, Amber,
you have to come to my party.

04:40.649 --> 04:42.913
It'll be a total disaster without you.

04:42.985 --> 04:46.284
Oh, that is so true.

04:47.589 --> 04:50.581
But my mom let me audition
for <i>Singing With The Stars</i>

04:50.659 --> 04:52.149
and if they have any taste,

04:52.227 --> 04:55.663
I'll be singing with Hannah Montana
Saturday night.

04:55.731 --> 04:57.790
Okay. Well, I gotta go to the bathroom.

04:57.866 --> 05:00.994
I haven't looked at myself
in like a half hour.

05:02.170 --> 05:05.537
Okay, so maybe we can't get rid
of that stupid list,

05:05.607 --> 05:07.268
but I can make darn sure

05:07.342 --> 05:09.902
that Amber never gets to sing
with Hannah Montana.

05:09.978 --> 05:14.176
<i>By day, I play</i>
<i>the part in every way</i>

05:14.249 --> 05:17.446
<i>Of simple, sweet, calm and collected!</i>

05:19.154 --> 05:21.247
Or I can make darn sure she does.

05:21.323 --> 05:22.881
You could do that?

05:22.958 --> 05:24.983
Sometimes you gotta fight fire with fire.

05:25.060 --> 05:26.721
Amber likes to make fun of people,

05:26.795 --> 05:28.626
and I'm gonna make sure
she knows what it feels like.

05:28.697 --> 05:30.688
Oh, boy!
Once the world hears her sing,

05:30.766 --> 05:34.224
she'll be at the bottom
of her own stupid list.

05:34.302 --> 05:36.361
Amber sounds like my pet pig, Luann,

05:36.438 --> 05:39.339
after she birthed
her first batch of piglets.

05:39.408 --> 05:42.172
- I can't believe it.
- I know, she's horrible.

05:42.244 --> 05:45.680
No, I can't believe
you had a pet pig named Luann!

05:46.548 --> 05:49.517
We thought it was a Lou
before the kids came.

05:54.990 --> 05:57.686
<i>If we were a movie</i>

05:57.759 --> 05:58.885
<i>I'd be the best friend... </i>

06:03.298 --> 06:04.322
<i>If we were a... </i>

06:07.569 --> 06:08.831
<i>If we... </i>

06:09.371 --> 06:10.497
<i>We... </i>

06:11.373 --> 06:12.772
Hey, Dontzig!

06:12.841 --> 06:16.208
Could you tell your dog
to keep his opinions to hisself?

06:16.278 --> 06:19.179
Oh, is Oscar bothering you, Stewart?

06:19.247 --> 06:20.271
Yeah!

06:20.348 --> 06:22.282
Good boy, Oscar!

06:23.418 --> 06:25.318
Please make it stop.

06:27.089 --> 06:28.351
Thank you.

06:28.423 --> 06:31.483
And about what I said
in traffic this morning,

06:31.560 --> 06:33.289
she cut me off.

06:35.030 --> 06:38.488
Hey, Dad, I finally got that dog
to stop barking.

06:38.567 --> 06:40.831
Just took that big T-bone
from the fridge

06:40.902 --> 06:43.132
and chucked it over the fence.

06:43.872 --> 06:46.033
You mean the one that I dry rubbed,

06:46.108 --> 06:48.872
tenderized and marinated
for 48 hours?

06:50.712 --> 06:53.681
No, the other one?

06:54.850 --> 06:56.579
Jackson Rod Stewart!

06:57.786 --> 07:01.813
I cook, I clean,
I work my fingers to the bone

07:01.890 --> 07:03.755
and what's my reward?

07:05.293 --> 07:07.056
Hello, Stewarts.

07:07.729 --> 07:10.721
Oscar just wanted to thank you
for the T-bone.

07:11.666 --> 07:15.762
Oh, and next time, he'd like
a twice-baked potato on the side.

07:17.172 --> 07:18.833
Oh, that's right, baby.

07:18.907 --> 07:22.673
No sour cream, it gives him gas.

07:30.619 --> 07:34.385
Sweet niblets,
this is worse than the barking dog!

07:36.000 --> 07:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:55.243 --> 07:58.974
- Hey. What's all this?
- Hey. So, check it out.

07:59.047 --> 08:00.639
I took some of Hannah's
concert speakers

08:00.715 --> 08:02.706
and I stuck them over
in Dontzig's yard.

08:02.784 --> 08:04.115
Next time that little dog barks,

08:04.186 --> 08:07.587
he's gonna find out that
my woofer's bigger than his.

08:08.623 --> 08:12.354
- You actually think this might work?
- There's only one way to find out.

08:12.427 --> 08:13.758
Oh, look, there he is.

08:17.299 --> 08:20.666
- Would you like to do the honors?
- Don't mind if I do.

08:29.578 --> 08:32.706
- And that's how the big dog does it.
- Oh, yeah.

08:34.381 --> 08:36.543
Hey, what's that little rat doing now?

08:36.618 --> 08:39.018
Hey! Get away from those speakers!

08:39.087 --> 08:41.248
Put your leg down. Put your leg...

08:41.323 --> 08:43.381
<i>Put your leg down!</i>

08:46.761 --> 08:50.424
Well, it may be dark,
but at least it's quiet.

08:52.968 --> 08:56.267
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, this is much better.

09:04.045 --> 09:07.776
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Cramp!

09:07.849 --> 09:11.615
I must've worked out
too hard last night.

09:11.686 --> 09:13.210
Y'all just go on without me.

09:13.288 --> 09:15.756
I'm just gonna sit at this random table

09:15.824 --> 09:19.920
with these random people
till the pain subsides.

09:20.662 --> 09:22.323
I miss you guys!

09:23.331 --> 09:26.357
- Listen, Oliver...
- Don't look at me when you talk.

09:26.434 --> 09:28.231
So, have you heard
from the producers yet?

09:28.303 --> 09:30.464
Are they actually gonna let Amber
be on the show?

09:30.538 --> 09:33.405
Hey, how's it going?
Just resting a cramp.

09:34.142 --> 09:36.303
If you're not gonna look at us,
we're not gonna tell you.

09:36.378 --> 09:38.573
Yeah, and it's really good.

09:40.982 --> 09:42.745
- Oliver!
- Okay.

09:42.817 --> 09:45.047
All right. Not only is she
gonna be on the show,

09:45.120 --> 09:46.485
guess who gets to give her
the good news?

09:46.554 --> 09:47.953
Okay, this is so worth it!

09:48.023 --> 09:51.857
I know. I'm just waiting
for the right mouthful of pasta salad.

09:51.926 --> 09:54.486
Oh, that's a good one! And send.

09:55.130 --> 09:56.529
Hide me.

10:01.036 --> 10:02.435
Hello?

10:03.438 --> 10:05.702
Hey, Amber, it's Hannah Montana.

10:07.442 --> 10:08.773
Gross!

10:10.945 --> 10:12.742
The producers asked me
to call you to tell you

10:12.814 --> 10:15.408
that you are
one of the three lucky people

10:15.483 --> 10:18.077
performing with me
on <i>Singing With The Stars!</i>

10:21.756 --> 10:24.782
Anywho, they'll call you with the deets.
I can't wait to meet you.

10:24.859 --> 10:27.054
Thank you, thank you so much!

10:27.128 --> 10:31.690
Oh, don't be silly, you deserve
everything you're gonna get. Bye.

10:34.035 --> 10:36.799
Hey, everybody, I'm gonna be
singing with Hannah Montana

10:36.871 --> 10:39.101
on <i>Singing With The Stars!</i>

10:43.278 --> 10:46.941
Okay, who wants to hear the song
I'm gonna sing on the show?

10:51.753 --> 10:53.687
I think we all do!

10:54.189 --> 10:55.713
I know I do!

10:56.591 --> 10:58.889
Well, if you insist. I mean...

11:00.528 --> 11:04.862
<i>By day, I play</i>
<i>the part in every way</i>

11:04.933 --> 11:10.667
<i>Of simple, sweet, calm and collected</i>

11:14.576 --> 11:15.873
- But she...
- Her voice...

11:15.944 --> 11:17.241
- You said...
- I know...

11:17.312 --> 11:18.779
But now...

11:19.414 --> 11:22.144
Then who did you guys
hear in the bathroom?

11:22.217 --> 11:24.412
<i>The other side, the other side</i>

11:24.486 --> 11:27.944
<i>The other side of me</i>

11:30.792 --> 11:35.024
I thought we had an agreement.
No singing. Snaps and claps only.

11:37.665 --> 11:41.863
Okay, let's just calm down.
Let's try to find the bright side in this.

11:44.873 --> 11:46.306
- I got nothing.
- Me, neither.

11:46.374 --> 11:48.239
Sweet niblets.

11:50.712 --> 11:53.078
<i>The other side, the other side</i>

11:53.148 --> 11:55.139
<i>I want you to see</i>

11:55.216 --> 11:58.913
<i>The other side, the other side</i>
<i>The other side of me</i>

11:58.987 --> 12:00.454
Yeah!

12:00.522 --> 12:01.750
That's great, Hannah.

12:01.823 --> 12:05.554
And after that
you're gonna hug Amber Addison.

12:05.627 --> 12:08.619
Brian will say something
he thinks is funny,

12:09.497 --> 12:12.694
try to laugh,
it'll be over before you know it.

12:12.767 --> 12:13.995
Don't worry, I'm used to it.

12:14.068 --> 12:17.367
My dad gets all his jokes
from bubble gum wrappers.

12:17.439 --> 12:20.431
Yeah, well, that would be
a step up for Brian.

12:22.644 --> 12:25.841
Look, this must be
where the losers stand.

12:25.914 --> 12:29.077
There's puddle stains
from all the drippy nervous sweat.

12:29.150 --> 12:31.209
Lola! Would you please focus!

12:31.286 --> 12:32.947
Amber's got a real shot at winning this.

12:33.021 --> 12:36.320
And if she does, that list
will be the least of our problems.

12:36.391 --> 12:38.985
- We've got to do something.
- You think?

12:41.029 --> 12:44.658
- Whoa, that is so cool. What is it?
- The beginning of the end.

12:44.732 --> 12:46.962
We enter through the smoke,
Amber sings great,

12:47.035 --> 12:50.061
then you and I are on the bottom
of the Cool List till we're seniors.

12:50.138 --> 12:54.598
And I'm talking blue haired,
Bingo playing, mitten knitting seniors.

12:56.377 --> 12:59.039
Maybe. And maybe not.

12:59.113 --> 13:00.580
What are you up to?

13:00.648 --> 13:05.176
Remember my exploding volcano
disaster at last year's science fair?

13:05.253 --> 13:06.481
Mount Saint Lilly?

13:06.554 --> 13:09.751
People were blowing lava
out of their nose for a week.

13:09.824 --> 13:11.689
Well, if I could do that by accident,

13:11.759 --> 13:14.990
imagine what I can do
to Amber on purpose.

13:15.063 --> 13:16.690
I'm imagining.

13:18.066 --> 13:19.693
And I'm liking.

13:30.512 --> 13:32.139
What the...

13:32.847 --> 13:36.339
Hey, Dad. Say hello to Rocky.

13:36.417 --> 13:40.080
Hey, Rocky, you big, drippy horse, you.

13:40.154 --> 13:42.748
What are you doing
in my Malibu dog house?

13:44.292 --> 13:45.816
I borrowed him from a friend.

13:45.894 --> 13:49.523
And then I invited Dontzig
and his little yapper over to play.

13:49.597 --> 13:52.122
Wait till that little yapper finds out
that he's playing lunch.

13:52.200 --> 13:53.599
Yes, he is.

13:53.668 --> 13:56.865
Son, I don't like that yapping little
purse puppy anymore than you do,

13:56.938 --> 13:58.872
but I don't wanna see him
swallowed whole.

13:58.940 --> 14:01.170
Don't worry, Dad.
I've got his leash tied to my wrist.

14:01.242 --> 14:02.641
Rocky's not going anywhere.

14:03.811 --> 14:05.745
Well, as long you're sure
it's just gonna scare him,

14:05.813 --> 14:07.872
I guess it's worth a shot.

14:14.255 --> 14:16.485
Oscar, no!

14:17.158 --> 14:21.185
- Oh, is little Oscar scared?
Not exactly.

14:27.035 --> 14:30.368
Very thoughtful, Stewart.
Osky needed a little exercise.

14:31.539 --> 14:34.406
- Yeah, well, so do you.
- So do you.

14:34.475 --> 14:37.967
- Well, so do you.
- So do you.

14:38.046 --> 14:40.909
- So do you.
- So do you.

14:40.982 --> 14:42.244
So do you.

14:42.483 --> 14:45.077
Rocky, Rocky. Heel, heel, heel, heel.

14:45.153 --> 14:47.553
Rocky, whoa. Heel. Oh, boy.

14:48.656 --> 14:52.353
Go ahead, primp all you want,
Little Miss Cool List.

14:52.427 --> 14:54.452
You're about to have
a make-up malfunction

14:54.529 --> 14:57.054
people will be downloading forever.

14:58.666 --> 15:00.031
She won't get hurt or anything, right?

15:00.101 --> 15:03.093
Just her pride, nationwide.

15:03.738 --> 15:07.606
Nowhere to hide, humilified, sad inside.

15:08.476 --> 15:09.704
Are you done?

15:09.777 --> 15:11.267
Just remember, you go through the red

15:11.346 --> 15:14.873
and she goes through the green
because she's mean

15:14.949 --> 15:17.850
like an evil queen. Now, I'm done.

15:17.919 --> 15:19.682
- How do I look?
- Like a star.

15:19.754 --> 15:23.690
I can't believe you're about to sing
in front of 30 million people.

15:23.758 --> 15:25.385
And that's just America.

15:25.460 --> 15:30.159
There's Canada and Europe
and the Soviet Reunion.

15:30.231 --> 15:34.429
Okay, that is so stupid.
The Soviet Reunion is in Europe.

15:35.937 --> 15:38.599
You know I'm not good in geology.

15:38.673 --> 15:41.506
I'm sorry, Ashley. I'm just nervous.

15:41.576 --> 15:45.137
Well, don't be.
Forget about the fact that it's live.

15:45.213 --> 15:46.646
Forget that if you screw up,

15:46.714 --> 15:49.706
everyone in the whole world
will be laughing at you.

15:49.784 --> 15:51.979
Just put that out of your head.

15:52.053 --> 15:54.578
It wasn't in my head. Until now.

15:55.757 --> 15:57.657
Oops. My bad.

15:58.326 --> 15:59.987
Have a good show.

16:05.033 --> 16:08.025
Hey, Amber!
You all ready for your big number?

16:09.637 --> 16:12.697
Hannah, I can't do this.
I can't go out there.

16:13.941 --> 16:15.238
Hey.

16:15.910 --> 16:17.138
Hey.

16:17.812 --> 16:19.905
Everything is gonna be fine

16:19.981 --> 16:22.882
as long as you go through
the green arch.

16:22.950 --> 16:25.544
I repeat, green arch.

16:30.958 --> 16:33.552
Oh, no, no, no. No, no, no.
I'm gonna screw up.

16:33.628 --> 16:34.959
I know I'm gonna screw up.

16:35.029 --> 16:38.465
Listen, sometimes
I have these worries, too.

16:38.533 --> 16:42.299
But you know what two words
always get me through it?

16:42.370 --> 16:44.736
Green arch. See you out there.

16:49.143 --> 16:51.907
Hey, come on. Get into position.

16:51.979 --> 16:53.844
It's gonna be a blast.

16:54.515 --> 16:56.244
You don't understand.

16:56.317 --> 16:59.252
- I can't be made fun of again.
- Again?

16:59.987 --> 17:02.387
When has anyone
ever made fun of you?

17:04.058 --> 17:08.050
Well, I know it's hard to believe
looking at how beautiful I am now,

17:09.196 --> 17:13.463
but when I was a kid,
I was the geeky girl with glasses,

17:14.202 --> 17:15.863
the one that everyone teased
all the time.

17:15.936 --> 17:17.165
Really? How geeky?

17:17.238 --> 17:20.366
You wouldn't happen to have
any pictures, would you?

17:20.441 --> 17:23.501
You know, because then
I could feel your pain.

17:25.179 --> 17:27.579
No, I burned them all.

17:27.647 --> 17:30.344
And I'm always afraid
it's going to happen again.

17:30.418 --> 17:32.978
So you make fun of people now

17:33.054 --> 17:36.285
because of what people did to you
when you were a geeky little kid?

17:36.357 --> 17:40.953
- Yes. Yes, I do.
- Well, you shouldn't do that.

17:41.028 --> 17:44.259
Don't you get it?
When you fight fire with fire,

17:46.701 --> 17:49.169
all you get is a bigger fire.

17:49.237 --> 17:51.797
I know, and now I'm gonna flame out

17:51.873 --> 17:55.400
in front of America, Asia
and the Soviet Reunion.

17:56.377 --> 17:59.471
- You mean Russia.
- Oh, man, we're on there, too.

18:01.916 --> 18:03.713
Okay, listen.

18:03.785 --> 18:06.879
If I can promise you that you're
gonna go out looking great,

18:06.954 --> 18:10.617
can you promise me that
you're gonna be a better person?

18:11.826 --> 18:13.691
And then buy a globe?

18:14.228 --> 18:17.391
Yeah. But could you really
make that happen?

18:17.465 --> 18:19.092
I can pretty guarantee you
that you're gonna come out

18:19.167 --> 18:21.192
looking a whole lot better than me.

18:21.269 --> 18:22.531
Places!
- Oh, no.

18:22.603 --> 18:25.128
Hey. You're gonna do fine. Just...

18:26.574 --> 18:28.201
Just enter through the red arch.

18:28.276 --> 18:30.506
- But you said green.
- And now I'm saying red.

18:30.578 --> 18:33.069
Just do it before I change my mind.

18:33.147 --> 18:35.877
Hey, remember, better person.

18:35.950 --> 18:37.645
And then a globe.

18:38.786 --> 18:40.413
Sweet niblets.

18:41.789 --> 18:45.350
And now our final contestant
from Malibu, California.

18:45.426 --> 18:47.951
Give it up for Amber Addison!

18:50.765 --> 18:54.861
<i>By day, I play</i>
<i>the part in every way</i>

18:54.936 --> 18:58.167
<i>Of simple sweet, calm and collected</i>

18:59.440 --> 19:02.568
<i>Pretend, to my friends</i>
<i>I'm a chameleon</i>

19:04.178 --> 19:07.204
<i>Can make a girl feel disconnected</i>

19:07.548 --> 19:11.575
<i>Feel like a star</i>
<i>A super hero</i>

19:11.652 --> 19:15.679
<i>Sometimes it's hard to separate</i>
<i>Got too much on my plate</i>

19:15.756 --> 19:19.920
<i>If you could see</i>
<i>the other side of me</i>

19:19.994 --> 19:22.462
<i>I'm just like every... </i>

19:24.732 --> 19:27.462
I may have a used
a little too much green.

19:29.971 --> 19:31.495
You think?

19:37.011 --> 19:39.002
I've been thinking about it
and you know what,

19:39.080 --> 19:40.377
I don't care what anybody else says,

19:40.448 --> 19:43.281
you're my real friends
and I'm sitting with you.

19:43.351 --> 19:46.582
Hey, how's it going?
I just dropped a taquito.

19:46.654 --> 19:48.747
Careful, green bean, you're showing.

19:48.823 --> 19:52.281
That's 'cause somebody didn't
make this gunk so easy to get off!

19:52.360 --> 19:54.658
Don't blame me, blame science.

19:55.229 --> 19:56.457
What are you gonna do now?

19:56.530 --> 19:59.090
Not only did Amber win,
she's gonna get a recording contract.

19:59.166 --> 20:01.498
All because
you had to be a good person.

20:01.569 --> 20:03.696
I hate when you do that!

20:03.771 --> 20:07.673
Guys, don't worry about it,
it's all gonna be worth it. Trust me.

20:13.781 --> 20:15.009
Ashley.

20:15.082 --> 20:17.880
Fine. Snaps and claps only.

20:18.686 --> 20:24.522
Anyway, as you all know,
last night I was the big winner.

20:24.592 --> 20:27.527
But before that happened,
I made a promise to myself

20:27.595 --> 20:31.190
and to my new best friend,
Hannah Montana.

20:31.265 --> 20:33.927
- Still worth it?
- Wait for it.

20:34.001 --> 20:37.402
So I'm doing something
really drastic to the List.

20:37.471 --> 20:38.961
Wait for it.

20:39.840 --> 20:43.469
Dandruff Danny, you and your flakes
are ahead of those flakes.

20:43.544 --> 20:45.705
I'm not at the bottom!

20:46.414 --> 20:48.006
In your face!

20:53.120 --> 20:54.644
Still waiting.

20:56.791 --> 20:58.019
Okay.

20:58.092 --> 21:01.255
Not exactly what I was hoping for,

21:01.329 --> 21:04.890
but at least she was being nice
to somebody.

21:04.966 --> 21:06.558
That's it?

21:06.634 --> 21:08.898
You're not even gonna try
to get her back?

21:08.970 --> 21:11.530
Come on, it's just a stupid list.

21:11.605 --> 21:13.596
Besides, I learned my lesson.

21:13.674 --> 21:16.643
When you fight fire with fire,
you just get burned.

21:16.711 --> 21:19.874
I wish you would have
told me that before.

21:19.947 --> 21:21.380
Before what?

21:21.449 --> 21:25.078
Well, I kind of arranged
a little surprise for Amber.

21:26.287 --> 21:28.312
Ew!

21:29.857 --> 21:31.757
Who did this?

21:33.995 --> 21:36.429
Come on, y'all, it's not funny.

21:38.599 --> 21:41.568
Although, I must say,
I do love her in green.

21:46.173 --> 21:49.540
<i>In the end we'd be laughing</i>

21:49.610 --> 21:52.443
<i>Watching the sunset fade to black</i>

21:52.513 --> 21:54.208
<i>Show the names</i>

21:54.281 --> 21:56.943
<i>Play that happy song</i>

21:58.419 --> 22:01.081
Finally got that dang dog
to hush up, didn't you?

22:01.155 --> 22:03.851
- Thank you, Son.
- You're welcome.

22:16.470 --> 22:18.495
Next time, trim the fat.

22:19.106 --> 22:23.065
We've got our figures to worry about.
Don't we, Osky baby?

22:24.245 --> 22:27.476
Come on, Osky wants another piece.
Cut faster!
