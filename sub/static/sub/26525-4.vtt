WEBVTT

00:01.784 --> 00:04.134
My name is Kara Zor-El.
I'm from Krypton.

00:04.178 --> 00:06.615
I'm a refugee on this planet.

00:06.658 --> 00:09.052
I was sent to Earth
to protect my cousin.

00:09.096 --> 00:11.054
But my pod
got knocked off course.

00:11.098 --> 00:12.621
And by the time I got here,

00:12.664 --> 00:17.408
my cousin had already grown up and become... Superman.

00:17.452 --> 00:19.932
I hid who I really was
until one day

00:19.976 --> 00:23.545
when an accident forced me to reveal myself to the world.

00:23.588 --> 00:27.244
To most people, I'm a reporter
at CatCo Worldwide Media.

00:27.288 --> 00:29.464
But in secret I work
with my adopted sister

00:29.507 --> 00:32.510
at the DEO to protect
this planet I call my home

00:32.554 --> 00:35.209
from anyone
that means to cause it harm.

00:36.253 --> 00:38.342
I am Supergirl.

00:39.517 --> 00:41.345
Previously onSupergirl...

00:41.389 --> 00:44.087
I need to find
Mercy and Otis Graves.

00:44.131 --> 00:45.393
They worked for Cadmus.

00:45.436 --> 00:47.351
I made a vow
to live a peaceful life,

00:47.395 --> 00:49.658
stand up for people
in a different way.

00:49.701 --> 00:50.963
This is Fiona.

00:51.007 --> 00:52.791
She's organizing
other monsters

00:52.835 --> 00:54.793
to defend themselves
against us.

00:54.837 --> 00:57.318
"Protect the aliens."
Who's gonna protect us?

00:57.361 --> 01:00.364
If Mr. Olsen were to
resume his role as Guardian,

01:00.408 --> 01:02.323
he will be subject
to immediate arrest.

01:02.366 --> 01:05.282
Your assistance
will be greatly noted.

01:05.978 --> 01:07.197
Earth first.

01:17.207 --> 01:18.600
Well, she's alive.

01:18.643 --> 01:20.906
It's only a matter of time
before she's conscious.

01:20.950 --> 01:22.125
She's strong.

01:22.169 --> 01:24.258
Emotionally maybe.

01:24.301 --> 01:25.346
But her pulse is erratic.

01:26.477 --> 01:28.305
She's sick.

01:28.349 --> 01:30.612
The suit is still filtering
the Kryptonite
out of her system.

01:30.655 --> 01:32.222
Well, then, we do
what we can while we wait.

01:33.267 --> 01:34.877
Starting with the atmosphere.

01:34.920 --> 01:36.748
Lena, I want you and Brainy to
work on getting the air clean.

01:36.792 --> 01:38.924
It's the only way we're going
to get her out of that thing.

01:38.968 --> 01:40.274
Will do.

01:40.926 --> 01:42.624
If you're in your mind palace,

01:43.668 --> 01:46.802
tell Streaky I said, "Hi."

01:46.845 --> 01:49.761
I have my shield on me.
I can help you find
Mercy and Otis.

01:49.805 --> 01:52.373
No. If you go out as Guardian,
you'll be arrested.

01:52.416 --> 01:55.245
She's right. We already have
enough boots on the ground.

02:16.527 --> 02:17.528
Hey.

02:18.399 --> 02:20.923
-No, I am not.

02:20.966 --> 02:22.185
Look, you saved her, J'onn.

02:22.229 --> 02:24.753
She came to me
to help her fight this, Alex.

02:24.796 --> 02:25.884
I turned her down.

02:25.928 --> 02:27.147
It was
more important for me

02:27.190 --> 02:28.278
to keep my vow
of non-violence

02:28.322 --> 02:29.758
than to fight by Kara's side.

02:29.801 --> 02:31.281
You chose to honor a new path.

02:31.325 --> 02:33.196
What if I'm just making
a big mistake?

02:34.502 --> 02:36.373
My father was
a great spiritual leader.

02:36.417 --> 02:38.984
Maybe I never will be.

02:39.028 --> 02:42.597
Maybe I've just spent
too many years steeped
in rage to really change.

02:45.426 --> 02:46.905
You know,
before I caught Supergirl,

02:46.949 --> 02:48.516
I was downtown at a rally.

02:48.559 --> 02:51.345
An anti-alien group.
Full of extremists.
It was awful.

02:51.954 --> 02:53.390
I almost...

02:56.480 --> 02:59.048
A friend of mine, Fiona,
she's missing, too.

02:59.091 --> 03:00.310
Another alien. Missing.

03:00.354 --> 03:02.486
Just because I chose
to lay down arms.

03:04.575 --> 03:08.013
And I left you here
to pick up the pieces
at the DEO.

03:08.057 --> 03:09.276
How are you managing?

03:10.712 --> 03:12.192
I'm good now.

03:14.803 --> 03:15.847
Look,

03:16.979 --> 03:18.110
if you really want to help,

03:18.154 --> 03:19.808
you can search
for them telepathically.

03:21.940 --> 03:23.028
All right.

04:08.813 --> 04:11.425
What's happening?

04:12.077 --> 04:14.123
Why am I in here? Get me out!

04:14.166 --> 04:17.344
Hey, it's okay.
Just breathe. I'm here.

04:19.389 --> 04:21.348
Mercy fired Kryptonite
into the air.

04:21.391 --> 04:23.741
I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.

04:23.785 --> 04:25.439
No, no. Hey, look at me.

04:25.482 --> 04:29.399
You're fine. This suit is
keeping you alive.

04:29.443 --> 04:31.836
Okay, so, just breathe.

04:33.838 --> 04:36.101
I'm okay.

04:36.145 --> 04:37.407
Tell me everything.

04:42.543 --> 04:43.631
What is this?

04:45.110 --> 04:46.416
Who are you people?

04:46.460 --> 04:48.462
Relax, man.
Anything for the cause.

04:48.853 --> 04:49.854
Okay.

04:51.029 --> 04:52.466
Make it look convincing.

04:52.509 --> 04:55.556
It's going to look
real convincing.

04:59.342 --> 05:00.735
I thought
we didn't kill humans.

05:00.778 --> 05:02.563
He wasn't human.

05:03.346 --> 05:04.652
He was loose ends.

05:08.351 --> 05:09.439
When can I take
this off?

05:09.483 --> 05:11.223
When the air is
100% Kryptonite-free.

05:11.267 --> 05:12.486
But I can't just sit here.

05:12.529 --> 05:14.879
This armor has
the exact amount of energy

05:14.923 --> 05:17.404
to filter out the Kryptonite
from your system.

05:17.447 --> 05:18.927
If you use this to fight--

05:18.970 --> 05:20.363
-But--
-But nothing.

05:22.278 --> 05:24.628
-I know what I'm doing.

05:24.672 --> 05:25.890
Director Danvers.

05:29.067 --> 05:30.068
I will check on you later.

05:32.723 --> 05:34.551
There's been
an incident at Site B.

05:34.595 --> 05:37.424
-It's Mercy Graves, ma'am.

05:37.467 --> 05:38.903
We need to get down there now.

05:38.947 --> 05:40.514
-They're already gone.

05:40.557 --> 05:41.863
-One.

05:42.472 --> 05:44.344
Another agent who turned.

06:10.457 --> 06:12.372
Man, you picked
the wrong house.

06:12.415 --> 06:13.634
Don't think so.

06:14.461 --> 06:16.419
Man, your age lives alone.

06:16.463 --> 06:19.117
No personal history
to be found.

06:19.161 --> 06:21.468
A bit dodgy, that. Red flags.

06:22.512 --> 06:25.080
So, tell me, J'onn J'onzz,

06:27.517 --> 06:29.432
how do you know Fiona?

06:29.476 --> 06:31.826
-You're her fiance.
-That I am.

06:32.870 --> 06:35.177
Luckiest man in the world.

06:35.220 --> 06:37.832
Only, Fiona dropped off
the radar.

06:39.616 --> 06:41.488
Not like her.

06:41.531 --> 06:44.665
And you seemed to have spent
some time following her about.

06:44.708 --> 06:46.710
-Fiona's just a friend.
-Well, friend,

06:47.711 --> 06:48.930
I'll ask you once more.

06:50.497 --> 06:51.672
Where is she?

06:53.587 --> 06:56.503
Today is not
the day to push me.

06:58.592 --> 07:00.594
Not from around here, are we?

07:00.637 --> 07:03.248
Relax, man.
Weren't going to hurt you.

07:03.292 --> 07:04.902
"Today is not
the day to push me."

07:08.428 --> 07:09.733
We're on the same side.

07:18.002 --> 07:21.658
-This is Fi's handwriting.
-Yeah, it's a badge number.

07:21.702 --> 07:23.530
And this is
the cop it belongs to.

07:23.573 --> 07:24.835
Fiona was looking into him.

07:24.879 --> 07:26.663
And I tried to follow up,
but I got derailed.

07:26.707 --> 07:29.840
-Family emergency.

07:29.884 --> 07:32.103
-I think so.

07:32.147 --> 07:34.497
Then I am
just buzzing to meet him.

07:34.541 --> 07:36.543
He's got tricks.
I'd be careful if I were you.

07:36.586 --> 07:39.763
Ah, don't worry.
You've got tricks,
I've got tricks, too.

07:39.807 --> 07:41.722
You got a name
to go with those tricks?

07:43.288 --> 07:45.595
Right. How rude of me.

07:50.992 --> 07:52.689
I'm Manchester Black.

07:58.390 --> 08:00.523
Do you know what we do
to people like you?

08:00.567 --> 08:03.787
Good morning,
Kopy and Hellgrammite.

08:03.831 --> 08:06.094
Careful. You so much
as touch that thing...

08:06.137 --> 08:07.530
What is that?

08:07.574 --> 08:10.402
It's a parasite. Like you.

08:11.621 --> 08:13.797
Scary talk
from a coward in a mask.

08:20.804 --> 08:23.981
"Coward in a mask."

08:24.025 --> 08:27.811
This mask signifies
that it doesn't matter
who I am. Who am I?

08:32.337 --> 08:34.383
I'm just a small piece

08:34.426 --> 08:37.865
of something much bigger,
something necessary.

08:39.736 --> 08:43.610
Something that will
restore this planet

08:44.306 --> 08:46.743
to its rightful inhabitants.

08:47.657 --> 08:48.702
Just a moment.

08:59.451 --> 09:01.366
Now you're a part of it, too.

09:01.410 --> 09:02.629
When we get out of here...

09:36.445 --> 09:37.838
All right, team, listen up.

09:40.623 --> 09:43.234
As you may have heard by now,

09:43.278 --> 09:46.716
two of our agents have
turned against us,

09:46.760 --> 09:49.893
against the very thing
that this agency stands for,

09:49.937 --> 09:54.245
and that is to protect
this planet from all threats.

09:54.289 --> 09:57.553
And that's from humans
and aliens alike.

09:57.597 --> 10:00.643
So, if at any point,
you find yourself wavering,

10:00.687 --> 10:04.125
I want you to take a moment
and look around

10:04.168 --> 10:06.954
and remember
why you signed up.

10:08.695 --> 10:11.611
We'll lean on each other,
like we always have.

10:12.263 --> 10:14.657
I believe in the DEO

10:14.701 --> 10:17.617
because I believe
in every one of you.

10:25.755 --> 10:28.932
I came for a pint.
I think you've got
the better idea.

10:29.716 --> 10:30.891
What he's having.

10:35.591 --> 10:36.592
Leave the bottle.

10:43.730 --> 10:46.167
Lost my job
to one of those roaches today.

10:48.082 --> 10:51.172
-Sorry. I get a few in me--
-No, no, no.

10:51.215 --> 10:52.913
I've been
hearing that a lot lately.

10:53.783 --> 10:55.655
-It's disgusting.
-It is.

10:57.569 --> 10:58.701
To us then.

11:20.418 --> 11:21.724
I'm trying, Father.

11:22.856 --> 11:24.727
Just like you taught me.

11:25.946 --> 11:29.297
But every time I reach out,
all I feel is anger.

11:29.340 --> 11:32.692
That scares me
because the anger is all mine.

11:36.783 --> 11:38.567
You said you'd be with me.

11:39.481 --> 11:40.656
So, prove it.

11:41.831 --> 11:42.832
Show me.

11:43.572 --> 11:44.965
J'onn.

11:46.270 --> 11:47.576
Fiona.

11:47.619 --> 11:50.274
And the next one. Huh?

11:50.318 --> 11:52.842
The next rally,
when might that be?

11:52.886 --> 11:55.802
Who cares?

11:55.845 --> 11:58.108
The real show is
happening tonight.

11:58.152 --> 12:00.807
Columbia and Fourth,
that's where
everyone is gonna go.

12:01.851 --> 12:02.939
What's happening tonight?

12:02.983 --> 12:05.942
-Can't tell you. She'd--

12:07.378 --> 12:09.076
Mercy. Mercy--

12:10.860 --> 12:14.168
Americans, man.
No idea how to drink.

12:16.779 --> 12:17.998
Did you get anything from him?

12:18.041 --> 12:19.477
Just kept whispering "Mercy."

12:20.043 --> 12:21.175
It mean something to you?

12:21.218 --> 12:23.525
Mercy Graves hurt
somebody I care about.

12:24.091 --> 12:25.657
I looked for her and...

12:27.659 --> 12:28.835
I heard Fiona's voice.

12:28.878 --> 12:30.706
I think Mercy may be
holding her captive.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.186
Heard her

12:33.448 --> 12:34.797
I'm a telepath.

12:36.625 --> 12:39.019
Let's lead
with that next time.

12:39.062 --> 12:41.151
I think Fiona is trying
to make contact with me.

12:41.195 --> 12:43.110
He said his mates had
something nasty
planned for tonight.

12:43.153 --> 12:45.721
Maybe that's where we can
meet this Mercy of yours.

12:46.504 --> 12:47.549
Columbia and Fourth.

12:55.078 --> 12:56.993
They're going for the precinct
on Fourth Street.

12:57.037 --> 12:58.473
Echo Team, I want you on me.

12:58.516 --> 13:01.171
Kilo Team, you're behind us
on overwatch. Let's go.

13:01.215 --> 13:03.783
I'm coming with you.
-The hell you are.

13:03.826 --> 13:05.959
I'm literally wearing armor.

13:06.002 --> 13:07.830
And I told you that
that armor is using

13:07.874 --> 13:09.876
everything it's got
to keep you safe.

13:09.919 --> 13:11.051
If you do
anything else in it--

13:11.094 --> 13:13.880
I've fought
at half capacity before.

13:13.923 --> 13:14.968
I can do this.

13:15.011 --> 13:17.013
There is
a chain of command here.

13:17.057 --> 13:20.190
I know what I'm capable of,
and you need my help.

13:20.234 --> 13:23.977
What I need is for you
to do exactly what I say.

13:31.636 --> 13:33.725
-Howdy.
-Evening.

13:35.162 --> 13:36.250
Howdy.

13:36.990 --> 13:38.034
Weren't you just...

13:39.993 --> 13:41.951
-Howdy.
-Howdy.

13:42.778 --> 13:45.128
-Howdy.
-Howdy.

13:45.172 --> 13:48.392
Sorry, we'll be providing
the excessive force today.

14:09.544 --> 14:11.198
It's a freaking Whac-A-Mole.

14:21.034 --> 14:22.557
I told you to stay put!

14:23.036 --> 14:24.428
You know I can't do that.

14:27.649 --> 14:28.911
[bullet shell casings
clatter]

14:43.883 --> 14:44.884
Supergirl!

14:54.894 --> 14:56.547
Brainy, I need you here now.

15:14.043 --> 15:15.697
Right. Up you get.

15:16.828 --> 15:18.656
I'm not gonna
hit you, but he will.

15:19.744 --> 15:21.398
-Ahimsa.
-Stop!

15:25.925 --> 15:27.752
It's Fi. Hey!

15:28.188 --> 15:29.493
J'onn.

15:31.756 --> 15:34.759
An alien attack
this evening
at NCPD Rampart Division,

15:34.803 --> 15:36.805
with reports
of wounded officers.

15:36.848 --> 15:40.200
We're told Supergirl was
on the scene
in some form of armor,

15:40.243 --> 15:41.810
but she appears injured

15:41.853 --> 15:43.159
and there's no official word
on her condition.

15:43.203 --> 15:45.161
She's fine.

15:45.205 --> 15:47.642
Thirty more seconds
and her suit would've
stopped filtering K-radiation.

15:47.685 --> 15:50.688
-And she would be dead.
-Horribly so.

15:50.732 --> 15:53.213
Is that Supergirl?
Or one of the blokes
from Daft Punk?

15:53.256 --> 15:55.258
Supergirl, unfortunately.

15:55.302 --> 15:57.782
-At your service.

15:57.826 --> 16:00.394
I'm told you are the one
to thank for the heads-up.

16:00.437 --> 16:02.396
-I'm sorry to hear about--
-Fiona.

16:02.439 --> 16:06.008
Yeah. Do you know
why Mercy and Otis have her?

16:06.052 --> 16:07.531
Fi's a psychic.

16:07.575 --> 16:09.098
We think they're using her
to control the other aliens.

16:09.142 --> 16:10.926
Targeted attacks
to scare humans.

16:10.970 --> 16:14.321
Director, President
on the line for you
over in Mobile Command.

16:15.061 --> 16:16.323
Excuse me.

16:18.890 --> 16:20.022
President of what?

16:21.458 --> 16:23.330
Director Danvers,
I have tolerated you

16:23.373 --> 16:26.986
while a proprietary device
was stolen on your watch,

16:27.029 --> 16:30.554
while a rogue agent
you recruited set
enemies of the state free.

16:30.598 --> 16:32.948
And I've done
everything possible
to lock down the situation.

16:32.992 --> 16:36.996
And on top
of that terrible Sunday
of incompetence,

16:37.039 --> 16:39.868
Supergirl goes on
a fun suicide mission.

16:39.911 --> 16:43.132
Supergirl is alive
and we're taking her
back to the DEO.

16:43.176 --> 16:47.702
Supergirl does not
leave the DEO
unless I give the order.

16:47.745 --> 16:48.746
Is that clear?

16:49.182 --> 16:50.357
Yes, sir.

16:50.400 --> 16:52.620
The country is
already nervous.

16:52.663 --> 16:55.536
They think an alien
in the White House has
undermined our democracy.

16:55.579 --> 16:57.668
It's created a powder keg.

16:57.712 --> 17:01.237
Your job is to make
the public feel safe,
not more at risk.

17:02.238 --> 17:03.848
So, handle this.

17:03.892 --> 17:05.981
Or so help me,
I will have you--

17:14.555 --> 17:16.122
That will be all, Director.

17:22.954 --> 17:25.435
Where are we
with filtering the Kryptonite
out of the air?

17:26.045 --> 17:27.394
Nowhere.

17:27.437 --> 17:30.179
We're wasting our time
because I've got nothing.

17:30.223 --> 17:31.702
We're sprocked!

17:34.009 --> 17:35.576
The best case scenario is
that Supergirl spends

17:35.619 --> 17:37.752
the rest of her life confined
in a life support suit.

17:37.795 --> 17:40.059
Unless, of course,
you've been hiding
some sort of giant vacuum

17:40.102 --> 17:42.844
that can suck
every particle of Kryptonite
out of the atmosphere.

17:42.887 --> 17:44.324
Okay. Wha...

17:47.283 --> 17:48.284
Wait, are you crying?

17:49.503 --> 17:50.547
No.

17:56.597 --> 17:59.513
That's unanticipated.

18:02.385 --> 18:03.386
What?

18:04.431 --> 18:06.607
I'm not a robot.

18:06.650 --> 18:09.349
I'm techno-organic.
I have feelings.

18:12.178 --> 18:13.527
You should be crying, too.

18:14.658 --> 18:16.356
These are tears of logic.

18:16.399 --> 18:17.661
Listen, I've been
where you are now,

18:17.705 --> 18:20.186
and believe you me,
I have feelings.

18:20.229 --> 18:24.190
Right now,
I'm feeling intense rage.

18:24.233 --> 18:27.106
I created this device
for good. To save Earth.

18:27.149 --> 18:29.369
And once again,
my technologies have
been stolen and abused.

18:29.412 --> 18:32.241
I could
murder someone right now.

18:32.285 --> 18:34.461
Do humans feel like this
all the time?

18:37.464 --> 18:40.815
It's intense and disruptive.

18:41.511 --> 18:42.904
How do you get anything done?

18:44.035 --> 18:45.167
My solution?

18:46.386 --> 18:49.171
-Boxes.
-Boxes.

18:49.215 --> 18:53.219
Yes. What variety
Wooden

18:53.262 --> 18:55.090
Imaginary.

18:55.134 --> 18:58.702
I want you to imagine
that you're full of tiny,
itty-bitty boxes.

18:58.746 --> 19:00.269
And then I want you
to take your feelings

19:00.313 --> 19:03.011
and I want you to shove them
into those itty-bitty boxes.

19:03.054 --> 19:05.100
And then I want you
to take those
and shove them way deep down

19:05.144 --> 19:07.189
till you forget
you even had feelings
in the first place.

19:07.233 --> 19:08.364
Then you and I are
gonna do science

19:08.408 --> 19:10.149
and get this air cleaned,
understand?

19:17.982 --> 19:19.114
Okay.

19:19.984 --> 19:21.029
I've done it.

19:22.291 --> 19:25.120
I feel much better.

19:26.469 --> 19:27.470
Excellent.

19:29.255 --> 19:30.604
Oh.

19:33.259 --> 19:35.391
Actually, I figured it out.

19:36.436 --> 19:37.785
It's nanites.

19:37.828 --> 19:40.179
L-Corp owns
a nano

19:40.222 --> 19:41.484
Formerly
Spheerical Industries.

19:41.528 --> 19:43.443
We just have to
reprogram the nanites

19:43.486 --> 19:45.662
so that they can detect
and filter the Kryptonite
out of the atmosphere.

19:45.706 --> 19:48.230
We don't need
a giant vacuum cleaner.

19:48.274 --> 19:50.232
Just trillions of small ones.

19:51.625 --> 19:54.149
I told you
not to leave the premises.

19:54.715 --> 19:56.282
I saved someone's life.

19:56.325 --> 19:58.371
By jeopardizing your own.

19:58.414 --> 20:00.373
I'm a hero, Alex.
I take risks.

20:00.416 --> 20:03.376
You are also an employee
of the DEO.

20:03.419 --> 20:04.681
We've been
working together for years.

20:04.725 --> 20:06.292
Why are you all of a sudden
acting like this?

20:06.335 --> 20:08.337
Because I am the director now!

20:09.686 --> 20:12.515
Okay? So if someone gets hurt,
that's on me.

20:13.473 --> 20:14.474
And if someone escapes

20:14.517 --> 20:16.040
and fills the air
with Kryptonite,

20:16.084 --> 20:17.433
that's on me!

20:18.260 --> 20:20.044
And if you had died--

20:20.088 --> 20:21.394
But I didn't die.

20:22.395 --> 20:23.874
And if it were you,

20:23.918 --> 20:26.703
you would have done
the exact same thing.

20:26.747 --> 20:28.401
I am not going to stop
using my own judgement.

20:28.444 --> 20:30.316
We have rules for a reason.

20:30.359 --> 20:32.970
Otherwise this place
would fall apart.

20:33.014 --> 20:35.277
So, if you want to
continue working with me,

20:35.321 --> 20:37.758
then you will obey orders.

20:37.801 --> 20:39.716
And as your
commanding officer,

20:39.760 --> 20:41.762
this is your final warning.

20:54.165 --> 20:55.602
I seem to recall

20:55.645 --> 20:58.213
you telling me
that Supergirl was dead.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.302
We never said it was official.

21:00.346 --> 21:02.043
We'll make her dead.

21:02.565 --> 21:04.437
The plan still stands.

21:04.480 --> 21:05.916
Your plan is small.

21:08.397 --> 21:09.442
Excuse me?

21:10.878 --> 21:12.880
You want to show people
that aliens are monsters.

21:12.923 --> 21:14.708
That's good,
but you don't do that

21:14.751 --> 21:18.015
by attacking their protectors,
the police, the DEO.

21:18.059 --> 21:19.495
Yeah, that will
make them afraid.

21:19.539 --> 21:21.889
That'll make them feel fear,
up here, in their mind.

21:21.932 --> 21:25.109
What you need to do is make
them feel it in their bones.

21:25.153 --> 21:30.854
And how do you plan
on doing that exactly?

21:30.898 --> 21:32.160
You show them

21:33.596 --> 21:35.555
that they need to be
afraid for their children.

21:38.906 --> 21:41.212
All right, forget the aliens.

21:41.256 --> 21:44.477
We're looking for this woman,
Fiona Byrne.

21:44.520 --> 21:46.783
We find her, we find them all.

21:47.393 --> 21:49.220
Sitrep.

21:49.264 --> 21:51.397
Lena and I have
found a way to clear
the atmosphere of Kryptonite.

21:52.659 --> 21:55.052
-We've reconfigured L-Corp--

21:55.096 --> 21:57.881
Uncertain. None of the nanites
have eaten Kryptonite before

21:57.925 --> 22:00.449
and they're understandably
very nervous.

22:00.493 --> 22:03.060
I don't wanna
ask too much of them,
they're just nanites.

22:04.975 --> 22:07.848
That word, "Ahimsa,"
it's Hindu?

22:08.892 --> 22:10.851
It means non-violence.

22:10.894 --> 22:12.766
Just something Fi used to say.

22:14.333 --> 22:15.334
Tell me about her.

22:16.073 --> 22:18.728
When I met Fi, I was...

22:18.772 --> 22:21.862
Well, I guess
you'd call it "ganged up."

22:21.905 --> 22:24.604
-Mmm.
-It was football hooligans.

22:24.647 --> 22:27.346
Sorry, soccer hooligans.

22:28.172 --> 22:29.870
Any excuse to break a window.

22:30.697 --> 22:31.959
We worked for my dad.

22:32.002 --> 22:33.613
He taught me
how to win a fight.

22:33.656 --> 22:36.137
It's easy,
once you know the trick.

22:36.180 --> 22:37.443
There's a switch in here.

22:38.966 --> 22:40.794
Keeps you from hurting
another person.

22:41.925 --> 22:43.405
You can turn it on...

22:44.624 --> 22:45.929
And off.

22:46.452 --> 22:48.541
So, why did you stop?

22:49.455 --> 22:50.804
I met Fi.

22:51.631 --> 22:53.372
She kept the books
for the gang.

22:54.460 --> 22:55.678
Didn't hurt no one.

22:55.722 --> 22:57.550
No one but me,
because one look from her,

22:57.593 --> 22:59.900
and I was
dead, man.

23:00.466 --> 23:02.119
Gone, hers.

23:04.470 --> 23:05.558
And she showed me...

23:06.776 --> 23:08.212
Showed me other ways.

23:09.953 --> 23:11.477
Non-violent ways.

23:12.695 --> 23:13.479
Ahimsa.

23:15.959 --> 23:18.658
Then the boys found out
she was an alien.

23:19.963 --> 23:22.618
Wasn't safe there anymore.
So, I told her...

23:26.187 --> 23:29.016
I told her to go to the States
so she'd be safe.

23:34.543 --> 23:35.805
Wait a minute.

23:37.938 --> 23:39.200
That ring...

23:41.681 --> 23:43.596
I saw something like this.

23:43.639 --> 23:46.033
Just a fragment,
right before I heard
Fiona's voice.

23:46.076 --> 23:47.556
Yeah, she has a matching one.

23:49.123 --> 23:50.429
This is what I need.

23:51.386 --> 23:52.692
A talisman.

23:52.735 --> 23:55.564
Something on her person
with emotional weight.

23:55.608 --> 23:58.480
I can use it like a cell tower
to amplify my link with her.

24:15.976 --> 24:18.500
-Mr. Olsen.
-Hey.

24:18.544 --> 24:21.242
-Of course, yeah. Um...

24:22.809 --> 24:25.115
I just wanted to mention
how thankful I am.

24:25.159 --> 24:27.683
'Cause, uh, I've been reading
about Ms. Grant,

24:27.727 --> 24:30.077
and CatCo, and you.

24:32.296 --> 24:35.648
You know what we do up here
is important, right?

24:37.824 --> 24:41.871
I've also been reading
about matters of the law.

24:43.220 --> 24:44.961
Did you know someone
could be prosecuted

24:45.005 --> 24:47.486
for continued instances
of the same crime?

24:47.703 --> 24:49.052
Yeah.

24:49.705 --> 24:51.620
-I have a lawyer.
-Of course.

24:51.664 --> 24:54.623
I'm not even saying
you're thinking
of taking up the shield again.

24:54.667 --> 24:56.799
But, if you were,

24:56.843 --> 25:00.542
especially with
Supergirl down... Don't.

25:00.586 --> 25:04.328
Is this the same Nia Nal
I'm talking to,
the cub reporter

25:04.372 --> 25:07.331
who convincingly
and rightfully
convinced her boss

25:08.594 --> 25:10.117
to act?

25:10.160 --> 25:11.945
And to speak out
when the innocent
are being attacked?

25:11.988 --> 25:14.338
I know. I don't
sound like myself.

25:14.382 --> 25:16.602
But that's
because this is different.

25:17.820 --> 25:19.735
If you go out there again,

25:21.563 --> 25:23.870
I have a feeling
something bad will happen.

25:26.916 --> 25:28.527
Heroes go out there,

25:30.180 --> 25:32.661
even when they know
something bad's gonna happen.

25:35.621 --> 25:37.361
That's what makes them heroes.

25:51.941 --> 25:53.987
-It's working.
'Ches.

25:54.814 --> 25:55.554
Fi?

25:56.772 --> 25:58.252
Can she hear me?

26:06.652 --> 26:07.914
Here you are, darling.

26:09.306 --> 26:11.178
You look an absolute state.

26:12.571 --> 26:13.746
And you look perfect.

26:15.661 --> 26:16.923
Did they hurt you?

26:17.750 --> 26:19.142
Nothing I can't handle.

26:21.405 --> 26:22.711
You were the first person
to see this.

26:22.755 --> 26:24.583
How can you not join me now?

26:24.626 --> 26:26.628
Because it's no longer
in my path to fight.

26:26.672 --> 26:28.630
I'm sorry, I cannot
join your battle.

26:32.939 --> 26:34.114
What's happening?

26:34.157 --> 26:36.072
We need to move quick.

26:36.116 --> 26:37.900
Fiona, do you know
where you are?

26:37.944 --> 26:40.903
I don't. They're using
a parasite to control
my telepathy powers

26:40.947 --> 26:42.644
to control other aliens.

26:42.688 --> 26:45.691
I think they've got me near
some sort of a crowd.

26:45.734 --> 26:48.563
I can smell cakes and sweets.

26:48.607 --> 26:50.739
Like the pick 'n' mix.
And there's music.

26:56.832 --> 26:58.878
-Bring her back.
-I can't.

26:58.921 --> 27:00.401
-I can't!

27:02.708 --> 27:03.926
I tried, Alex.

27:03.970 --> 27:06.276
I tried to use prayer,
the power of my mind

27:06.320 --> 27:07.669
to find Fiona, but...

27:09.192 --> 27:11.455
Every time I think
I'm getting somewhere,

27:11.499 --> 27:14.284
my mind is
just hijacked with anger.

27:15.111 --> 27:17.723
Violence, how I failed Kara.

27:17.766 --> 27:20.682
It's no use, I'm not the man
my father hoped I'd be.

27:20.726 --> 27:23.990
Only thing I've done right is
put you in charge of the DEO.

27:27.733 --> 27:29.691
No, that's...

27:29.735 --> 27:31.650
That's the only thing
that you've done wrong.

27:34.740 --> 27:35.784
What?

27:35.828 --> 27:38.831
Everything is my fault.

27:38.874 --> 27:43.009
I mean, all of this, it's...
It's on me, okay?

27:43.052 --> 27:46.186
A lot of bad things happened
here under my watch.

27:46.229 --> 27:48.754
But I prevailed
because I trusted my gut,

27:49.755 --> 27:51.365
and my people.

27:51.408 --> 27:53.715
Alex, you have to
trust your gut.

27:54.498 --> 27:57.763
You do that
and you will soar.

28:01.984 --> 28:05.640
You realize that, um, wisdom

28:06.859 --> 28:08.904
literally emanates from you?

28:10.776 --> 28:14.257
You are exactly who
your father saw
you would be.

28:18.697 --> 28:22.135
How do we reconcile who we are
with who we wanna be, Alex?

28:24.050 --> 28:25.486
We forgive ourselves.

28:26.182 --> 28:29.664
Pacifism doesn't
mean inaction.

28:29.708 --> 28:32.101
It just means that you have to
learn how to fight

28:32.145 --> 28:33.755
without raising the sword.

28:35.365 --> 28:37.280
I was right
to put you in charge.

28:37.324 --> 28:39.805
-Oh, that was too soon.

28:43.156 --> 28:47.595
Okay, so, you tell me
everything that you saw. Okay?

28:47.638 --> 28:50.424
We're gonna find Fiona
and the people who took her.

28:51.425 --> 28:52.600
Yes, boss.

28:52.643 --> 28:53.862
I'm scanning for anything
that draws a crowd

28:53.906 --> 28:55.951
within 100 miles
of National City.

28:55.995 --> 28:58.606
Cross-referencing those events
with every item of food sold

28:58.649 --> 28:59.825
at a pick 'n' mix

28:59.868 --> 29:02.610
and every known
psychic energy signature.

29:02.653 --> 29:04.046
So, have you found them?

29:04.090 --> 29:06.701
Yes, of course. They're
at the National City Fair.

29:06.745 --> 29:08.747
I'll go get Manchester.
Nice work, Brainiac.

29:08.790 --> 29:11.662
Okay,
assemble a strike team,
all available agents.

29:11.706 --> 29:13.708
And make sure
that they're ready to go
in five minutes.

29:13.752 --> 29:14.753
Yes, ma'am.

29:17.016 --> 29:18.365
Hypothetically,

29:19.627 --> 29:21.760
what are the odds of us
winning without Supergirl?

29:22.891 --> 29:25.415
Aliens being mind-controlled,

29:25.459 --> 29:27.809
with no instinct
to protect themselves.

29:27.853 --> 29:29.506
Only harm others.

29:30.943 --> 29:32.335
The odds are not great.

29:33.859 --> 29:35.382
And with her?

29:35.425 --> 29:37.166
If she can handle
the fight, you will win.

29:38.211 --> 29:40.039
But the atmosphere isn't
clear of Kryptonite.

29:41.997 --> 29:43.390
Then finish getting it clear.

29:53.922 --> 29:56.359
-You've been drafted.
Wait, what?

29:56.403 --> 29:58.100
Isn't there still Kryptonite
in the air?

29:58.144 --> 30:00.059
I thought you were
doing things by the book.

30:00.711 --> 30:01.800
I was.

30:03.976 --> 30:05.804
But I really need you
out there with me.

30:09.068 --> 30:10.460
I was scared.

30:11.722 --> 30:15.291
Of failing,
of letting everybody down.

30:15.335 --> 30:17.903
The president, the country.

30:18.817 --> 30:20.731
So, I thought

30:20.775 --> 30:25.475
the rules would protect me
from screwing everything up.

30:25.519 --> 30:28.217
Mmm. Danvers sisters
have never really been big
on rules.

30:28.261 --> 30:31.177
I know and I forgot that
for a minute.

30:33.179 --> 30:34.528
I'm sorry.

30:37.574 --> 30:39.750
The only way that
we're gonna win this thing,

30:39.794 --> 30:43.667
is if I trust my instincts
and I trust yours.

30:45.234 --> 30:46.540
And you're right.

30:47.410 --> 30:49.238
The air isn't fully clear.

30:50.936 --> 30:52.111
So, this is a risk.

30:54.113 --> 30:55.679
Do you think you can do it?

30:55.723 --> 30:56.724
I know I can.

30:57.899 --> 30:58.944
Then suit up.

30:58.987 --> 31:00.249
No choice.

31:21.662 --> 31:23.229
Hey!
You smashed my Beebo.

31:23.272 --> 31:25.927
That's a metaphor for life.

31:25.971 --> 31:28.712
Will you stop
drawing attention to yourself?

31:28.756 --> 31:31.324
We have a job to do.

31:31.367 --> 31:33.326
Aliens are
mind-controlled.

31:33.369 --> 31:34.631
So all good here.

31:42.074 --> 31:44.772
Reported attack
at the National City Fair.

31:44.815 --> 31:46.905
Police are on-scene
securing the area,

31:46.948 --> 31:49.864
and people are
being advised to stay clear
of the fairgrounds.

31:49.908 --> 31:51.300
The attack began earlier today

31:51.344 --> 31:53.302
as people packed
the fairgrounds...

31:53.346 --> 31:55.174
[reporter continues
indistinctly]

31:58.133 --> 32:00.092
Air quality at 75%.

32:02.181 --> 32:03.182
Drop her.

32:24.246 --> 32:26.161
Ooh, not the pies.

32:38.913 --> 32:40.088
I can't believe he went.

32:41.133 --> 32:42.134
Little boxes.

32:44.527 --> 32:46.007
Ninety percent.

32:46.051 --> 32:47.574
That's still lethal
if the suit fails.

32:47.617 --> 32:49.968
You need to back off.
You need to try and conserve.

32:54.189 --> 32:56.017
I've just gotta
handle one more thing.

33:07.289 --> 33:08.551
Over there.

33:16.733 --> 33:19.040
Guys?
Guys, we gotta go.

33:19.084 --> 33:20.085
Guys?

33:40.757 --> 33:42.890
What's happening?

33:42.933 --> 33:44.413
The suit's taking
too much damage.

33:44.457 --> 33:46.415
So, power's being diverted
to life support.

33:46.459 --> 33:48.026
I'll give you a jump.

33:49.940 --> 33:51.681
You're gonna wanna hold still.

33:53.596 --> 33:55.207
Thanks
for the charge.

34:04.912 --> 34:06.305
What's happening now?

34:07.523 --> 34:09.221
I'm reading
full systems failure.

34:09.264 --> 34:12.093
The suit's locking down.
I can't move.

34:12.137 --> 34:15.270
-We should leave, sis.
-Not till we finish
what we started.

34:17.490 --> 34:19.057
Make her dead, got it.

34:19.579 --> 34:20.841
Screw it.

34:36.030 --> 34:38.206
I call this move
"the can opener."

34:38.250 --> 34:40.904
Ah, there's still Kryptonite
in the air, right?

34:40.948 --> 34:42.689
So, uh, what happens if
I pull the trigger?

34:42.732 --> 34:44.560
-No, stop!
-Air check.

34:44.604 --> 34:47.911
The atmosphere is 99% clear.

34:47.955 --> 34:49.783
Why are you protecting her?

34:49.826 --> 34:52.742
Why are you protecting
any of them?

34:52.786 --> 34:56.572
-Look at what they do.
-They aren't doing this.

34:56.616 --> 35:00.707
-You are.
People need
to be afraid.

35:00.750 --> 35:03.275
Even if it means
we have to sell it to them.

35:04.363 --> 35:06.016
100%.

35:06.060 --> 35:08.323
Rerouting power away
from life support.
Unlocking suit now.

35:08.367 --> 35:10.369
Yeah, what she said.

35:10.412 --> 35:12.110
Welcome to Otis-- Oh.

35:12.153 --> 35:14.808
No! We're fighting
for freedom.

35:15.287 --> 35:16.810
From roaches.

35:16.853 --> 35:18.638
From

35:23.512 --> 35:24.948
Now, they're free.

35:34.393 --> 35:35.176
Fi?

35:36.960 --> 35:39.049
Hey, I'm here, love.
I'm here.

35:40.442 --> 35:42.140
-I'm here, I'm here.

35:47.014 --> 35:49.059
-Here you are, darling.

35:50.409 --> 35:52.672
Okay, okay. We need
to get her to a hospital.

35:53.325 --> 35:56.110
No. I held on for you.

35:56.154 --> 35:58.504
I know, love. But there has
to be something we can do.

35:58.547 --> 35:59.983
There has to be
something we can do.

36:00.027 --> 36:02.986
-I could take away her pain.
-Then do it!

36:04.379 --> 36:05.250
Please, man.

36:07.208 --> 36:08.514
Hey.

36:08.557 --> 36:10.037
I'm here, I'm here.

36:11.256 --> 36:13.388
Just promise me...

36:13.432 --> 36:14.476
No, stop it.

36:14.520 --> 36:16.304
-Promise me.
-No.

36:16.348 --> 36:18.263
Please don't be angry.

36:19.264 --> 36:21.091
I know you'll want to.

36:24.007 --> 36:25.835
-I love you, Manchester.

36:27.228 --> 36:28.316
I love you.

36:28.360 --> 36:29.970
I don't want you
to leave me.

36:32.146 --> 36:35.410
I'll look after you.
I promise I'll look after you.

36:36.455 --> 36:37.891
That's my girl.

36:43.244 --> 36:44.332
Fi?

36:48.075 --> 36:49.076
Fi?

36:58.694 --> 37:00.261
Why me, man?

37:03.873 --> 37:05.397
They took my baby.

37:06.528 --> 37:08.487
They took my baby, man.

37:08.530 --> 37:11.316
Why, man

37:34.077 --> 37:37.298
I know that
in all likelihood, you'll want
to jump right back into work.

37:38.386 --> 37:39.431
But?

37:40.432 --> 37:41.607
But...

37:43.957 --> 37:45.306
What's going on?

37:47.439 --> 37:50.746
Congratulations,
Director Danvers.

37:52.966 --> 37:56.448
All right, we put one
in the win column.

37:56.491 --> 37:59.494
And that's...
That's because of you.

37:59.538 --> 38:01.844
You all should be
so proud of yourselves.

38:06.022 --> 38:08.938
-Hi. I'm Colonel Lauren Haley.

38:08.982 --> 38:10.984
-Hi.
-POTUS sent me.

38:11.027 --> 38:12.377
Given how you disobeyed
direct orders,

38:12.420 --> 38:14.379
he thought you might
need some oversight.

38:16.119 --> 38:18.383
And how long
will you be with us, Colonel?

38:19.384 --> 38:20.515
As long as it takes.

38:23.257 --> 38:24.519
It just should've
been a discussion.

38:24.563 --> 38:27.174
What did you expect me to do,
just sit here?

38:27.217 --> 38:28.436
What if you'd been
sent to prison?

38:29.437 --> 38:32.005
Yeah, about that.
I talked to my lawyer.

38:32.048 --> 38:34.703
It's weird. I...
No new charges.

38:35.617 --> 38:36.705
No indictment.

38:36.749 --> 38:38.794
The cops might even
deputize Guardian.

38:40.056 --> 38:41.710
I know, it's, uh...

38:41.754 --> 38:43.146
It worked out better than...

38:43.190 --> 38:44.322
-...I could have
possibly imagined.

38:44.365 --> 38:46.715
-You're trending.

38:46.759 --> 38:47.760
Yeah?

38:49.718 --> 38:51.111
In a bad way.

38:51.154 --> 38:53.418
"Roaches crushed
by Guardian's boot." What?

38:53.461 --> 38:55.550
"Humans strike back strong."

38:57.770 --> 38:59.337
"Guardian of Liberty."

39:08.433 --> 39:09.477
Yes.

39:10.304 --> 39:12.219
Mmm, I really need those.

39:12.262 --> 39:14.264
-Do you have any, um--
Yeah, three.

39:14.308 --> 39:16.179
What do you think this is,
amateur hour?

39:16.223 --> 39:18.573
The queen of pies.

39:19.052 --> 39:20.488
Thank you.

39:24.013 --> 39:25.841
Hey, you okay?

39:25.885 --> 39:31.586
Oh, I've dealt with much worse
than G.I. Jane coming
to babysit me.

39:31.630 --> 39:35.764
Yeah, but she wouldn't be here
if I had followed your orders.

39:35.808 --> 39:38.506
I'm sorry, where was
this attitude six hours ago?

39:38.550 --> 39:40.465
-I'm sorry.
-Hey...

39:41.379 --> 39:42.554
You followed your instincts.

39:42.597 --> 39:45.818
And I followed mine,
so there's no apologies.

39:47.210 --> 39:49.561
Being a leader means
doing what needs to get done

39:49.604 --> 39:51.258
and taking the consequences.

39:51.301 --> 39:53.826
So, we did the right thing.

39:53.869 --> 39:57.046
Well, hell or high water,

39:57.090 --> 39:59.309
-I've got your back.
-Mmm.

39:59.353 --> 40:00.833
Hell or high water.

40:00.876 --> 40:03.792
Oh, speaking of,
can you please
scratch this one spot...

40:03.836 --> 40:07.405
-Oh, absolutely not.
-I was in a full body cast.

40:07.448 --> 40:10.451
-I know.
-I can't...
It's really bothering me.

40:10.495 --> 40:12.584
-No.
-It's... Ow!

40:25.814 --> 40:27.207
How much for the lot?

40:54.277 --> 40:55.627
They're dead.

40:56.236 --> 40:57.455
Mercy and Otis.

40:58.194 --> 40:59.544
Supergirl is back.

41:00.414 --> 41:01.676
What are we supposed to do?

41:01.720 --> 41:03.548
Stop! Stop. Stop.

41:03.591 --> 41:06.507
What did I tell you?
There is no "we."
It doesn't matter who we are.

41:06.551 --> 41:08.553
It doesn't matter
who leads us.

41:09.728 --> 41:10.990
Jensen, the only thing
that matters is that

41:11.033 --> 41:14.341
you joined up
for a reason. Right?

41:16.865 --> 41:18.214
And that reason is because

41:18.258 --> 41:20.521
you wanted to make something
of yourself. Right?

41:20.565 --> 41:23.219
Yeah.
-Okay.

41:24.743 --> 41:26.353
Let's see what we can make.

41:27.223 --> 41:28.486
Okay.
