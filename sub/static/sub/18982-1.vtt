02:00.280 --> 02:02.200
Jacques, you are my guest today.

02:02.280 --> 02:03.660
Yes.

02:03.740 --> 02:07.070
You are a school teacher,
you like nature

02:07.160 --> 02:09.500
you are a keen
talk-show viewer

02:09.570 --> 02:13.030
and you collect Russian watches
from the 70's.

02:13.110 --> 02:15.110
Yes, exactly.

02:15.200 --> 02:17.830
You are 54 years old.

02:17.910 --> 02:19.660
Yes, that is true.

02:19.740 --> 02:21.110
- You are a widower.
- Yes.

02:22.610 --> 02:23.860
Do you believe in god?

02:25.990 --> 02:29.400
If you mean an old guy
with a beard

02:29.490 --> 02:32.910
who lives
in the clouds... no.

02:33.490 --> 02:35.410
Okay.

02:35.490 --> 02:37.410
What are your goals in life?

02:39.110 --> 02:42.520
To be happy.
That's the main thing.

02:42.610 --> 02:47.110
Also I have a special project
that I'm quite keen on.

02:47.190 --> 02:51.270
I would like to start
my own line of sports clothes.

02:52.020 --> 02:53.850
Interesting.

02:53.940 --> 02:57.100
Please tell us a little bit about
the dessert that you have chosen.

02:57.190 --> 03:01.440
We are all very impatient
and very much listening.

03:01.520 --> 03:05.390
Uh, yes, I have chosen
the strawberry Charlotte.

03:05.480 --> 03:09.560
And tell us in a few words why you
have chosen the strawberry Charlotte.

03:09.650 --> 03:12.690
Well, it is a very simple cake

03:12.770 --> 03:16.270
and very easy to make. Um..

03:16.350 --> 03:18.020
What the fuck?

03:18.100 --> 03:21.470
And the ingredients
are very inexpensive

03:21.560 --> 03:26.470
and they are not
so gross to touch

03:26.560 --> 03:28.510
very well.

03:28.600 --> 03:29.510
This is no good, cut.

03:29.600 --> 03:31.100
Dennis, why do you keep
scratching yourself?

03:31.180 --> 03:32.640
It's getting worse and worse!

03:32.720 --> 03:35.220
What, what?

03:35.310 --> 03:37.150
You've been scratching
yourself like a dog

03:37.220 --> 03:39.050
for the last three days.
What's up?

03:39.140 --> 03:40.890
Oh, it's nothing.

03:40.970 --> 03:42.530
It's just a few rashes,
it will go away.

03:44.220 --> 03:45.800
Rashes from what?

03:45.890 --> 03:50.140
Uh, you know, I thinks it's
an eczema breakout or something

03:50.220 --> 03:54.880
but it's actually kind of all
over, it's itching like hell.

03:54.970 --> 03:56.530
But you can't see it
on camera, can you?

03:58.050 --> 04:00.090
We can see it on camera,
it's gross.

04:00.180 --> 04:02.470
How do you expect
to make people want to cook?

04:02.550 --> 04:04.250
You look like a leper!

04:04.340 --> 04:06.590
I don't know, it's actually
probably the costume I think.

04:06.670 --> 04:11.090
You know, Suzy changed the detergent
from what she normally uses so

04:11.170 --> 04:13.670
I guess I have sensitive skin and I've
had a little bit of allergic reaction.

04:13.760 --> 04:15.510
So, I don't know, that's all.

04:15.590 --> 04:19.459
I have asked her to go back to
the old stuff and she said no

04:19.550 --> 04:23.140
there you go, I don't know, I don't like
to tell, but that's what has happened.

04:23.210 --> 04:26.420
Alright, listen, we're gonna to finish
like this for the rest of the day.

04:26.500 --> 04:29.080
We don't really have
a choice, so just..

04:29.170 --> 04:31.210
And go see a specialist.
don't stay like this.

04:31.290 --> 04:33.080
Yeah, yeah, I promise,
I will do it.

04:33.170 --> 04:34.170
Okay, let's go.

04:34.580 --> 04:35.830
Okay.

04:35.920 --> 04:37.170
Put your head back on.

04:38.540 --> 04:41.000
Got it. Yeah. I'm ready.

04:41.080 --> 04:42.620
You know I was thinking
of something.

04:42.710 --> 04:47.000
What if I grab your arms from
behind but really discreetly

04:47.080 --> 04:49.950
as soon as I see you starting to
itch and then I can hold them

04:50.040 --> 04:51.160
there and that'll help.

04:51.250 --> 04:52.750
Yeah, yeah, Jacques!

04:52.830 --> 04:56.950
You know, thanks a lot but, uh, you
just focus on being a guest alright.

04:57.040 --> 04:58.920
This is complicated enough
as it is.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.420
Okay, let's go again people
right away.

05:00.490 --> 05:01.870
Denis, whenever you're ready.

05:01.950 --> 05:03.620
Yeah, okay, I'm ready.
Alright, lets..

05:04.240 --> 05:06.070
Okay.

05:06.160 --> 05:08.410
So, the strawberry Charlotte..

05:55.580 --> 05:58.370
What are those sticky things
in the tummy for, daddy?

05:58.450 --> 06:00.110
Nothing at all.

06:00.200 --> 06:02.240
That's why I'm takin'
it all out, honey.

06:02.320 --> 06:03.900
I already told you about this.

06:03.990 --> 06:05.740
It's the same
for all the animals.

06:05.820 --> 06:07.440
The insides serve no purpose.

06:10.490 --> 06:12.160
Yeah. Ah!

07:11.070 --> 07:15.070
Reality! don't touch that,
it's disgusting.

07:15.150 --> 07:16.940
Now go wash your hands
we're about to eat.

07:17.030 --> 07:18.030
Okay.

07:30.400 --> 07:32.480
You're a real pain!

07:32.570 --> 07:34.200
I did not change detergents!

07:34.280 --> 07:36.200
How many times
do I need to tell you?

07:36.270 --> 07:38.270
You know I'm right,
don't think I'm an idiot.

07:38.360 --> 07:41.030
It smells different. I noticed
the smell on the first day.

07:41.110 --> 07:43.860
You're completely crazy,
you have a real problem!

07:43.940 --> 07:47.520
Yeah, I have a problem, I'll show you.
I don't think you realize! Look. See?

07:47.610 --> 07:50.400
Rashes all over my arms.
Rashes everywhere!

07:50.480 --> 07:53.180
I mean, look! See! It itches so
much I can't sleep at night!

07:53.270 --> 07:55.730
Look at what your shitty
detergent is doing to me!

07:55.810 --> 07:59.350
Alright? I'm being eaten
all over! See?

07:59.440 --> 08:01.110
But there's nothing at all.

08:01.180 --> 08:04.350
What are you talking about?
There's nothing there!

08:04.430 --> 08:05.560
Nothing there?

08:05.640 --> 08:07.510
Look at this. You see?

08:07.600 --> 08:10.430
I mean, all of my skin
is covered in bumps!

08:10.520 --> 08:13.400
All that so you can save a couple
bucks on a pack of detergent.

08:13.470 --> 08:15.100
And look at the result.

08:15.180 --> 08:17.640
I can't even wear a t-shirt
anymore because of you!

08:17.720 --> 08:20.640
Everything okay here?
What's the matter?

08:20.720 --> 08:23.130
You know the matter is that
this bitch won't listen to me

08:23.220 --> 08:24.630
and go back
to our old detergent!

08:25.260 --> 08:26.670
This bitch?

08:26.760 --> 08:29.340
Yeah, that's what I said,
yeah. Bitch!

08:29.430 --> 08:32.970
Okay, listen to me, this
is going to be very simple.

08:33.049 --> 08:36.299
From now on, you can wash your own
stupid costume, is that what you want?

08:36.380 --> 08:37.590
Sure, yeah! Whatever, fine.

08:37.669 --> 08:39.630
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

08:39.720 --> 08:41.260
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

08:41.340 --> 08:42.590
Well, good luck.

08:42.669 --> 08:44.169
Okay fine,
I'll do my own laundry.

08:45.260 --> 08:46.260
It's not a big deal.

08:47.380 --> 08:49.960
Um, oh, yeah.

08:50.050 --> 08:52.640
We got some letters for you.
Mainly complaints.

08:52.710 --> 08:54.040
About what?

08:54.130 --> 08:55.580
Well, about you scratching
yourself.

08:55.670 --> 08:58.420
Apparently it doesn't look good
and the fans are not happy.

08:58.500 --> 09:01.670
Okay, I get it.
I'll go and see a specialist.

09:13.580 --> 09:14.580
Hey!

09:17.210 --> 09:21.290
I was real careful not to film
your hands earlier.

09:21.380 --> 09:25.550
And after a while I had
the idea to zoom in

09:25.620 --> 09:27.660
on your face as much as possible

09:27.750 --> 09:30.250
and it really worked. We couldn't
see you scratching yourself

09:30.330 --> 09:31.910
all we would see was your head.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.420
That's nice. But there
are three other cameras.

09:35.500 --> 09:38.960
Forget it. It was a nice
thought anyway, but thanks.

09:39.040 --> 09:41.840
Also, I wanted to ask.

09:41.910 --> 09:43.700
You started off as an actor,
didn't you?

09:43.790 --> 09:47.420
- Nope, not at all.
- No. Shit.

09:47.490 --> 09:50.240
Wait. Why? What difference
does that make?

09:50.330 --> 09:53.790
No, I was just thinking,
as I am about to make a movie..

09:53.870 --> 09:58.170
I'm going to have loads of
little parts to fill so

09:58.240 --> 10:01.860
as you came across great on
camera, close-ups, you know

10:01.950 --> 10:05.150
I was thinking maybe
suggesting, but I guess not.

10:05.240 --> 10:07.240
- Well, no.
- Okay. No problem.

10:08.240 --> 10:10.360
There you go.

10:10.450 --> 10:12.280
Yeah. See you
tomorrow then.

10:25.780 --> 10:27.900
Why was there a videotape
in the hog?

10:30.570 --> 10:32.860
What are you talkin'
about, darling?

10:32.950 --> 10:37.160
Well, I saw a videotape come out earlier,
when daddy was emptying the insides.

10:38.990 --> 10:41.330
Stop talking nonsense.

10:41.400 --> 10:42.690
Come on, eat.

10:42.780 --> 10:45.080
But it's true.
I saw it.

10:45.150 --> 10:47.860
No.

10:47.940 --> 10:50.520
Listen, there can't be videotapes
inside the tummy of animals, darling.

10:50.610 --> 10:52.610
It simply is impossible.

10:52.690 --> 10:55.520
Reality, my sweetie pie,
listen to me.

10:55.610 --> 10:58.570
How could a hog
swallow a videotape?

10:58.650 --> 11:02.850
It's much too big, it wouldn't
go down, it's just not possible!

11:02.940 --> 11:05.020
Well maybe
that's what killed him.

11:05.110 --> 11:07.900
He choked on the tape
and tried to swallow it

11:07.980 --> 11:10.140
but it got stuck in his throat.

11:10.230 --> 11:13.560
No, he died because
I shot him, honey.

11:13.640 --> 11:16.390
And even if he did swallow the tape, it
would have been completely crushed up

11:16.480 --> 11:18.090
by his chewing it, you see?

11:18.160 --> 11:20.530
I mean, he wouldn't have
swallowed it in one piece.

11:20.620 --> 11:22.780
Think about it!

11:22.870 --> 11:26.740
Well, I don't know how
it's possible, but I saw it.

11:26.830 --> 11:28.330
I'm not crazy!

11:28.410 --> 11:30.860
I think you're just tired.

11:30.950 --> 11:33.320
Come on, it's time
for you to go to bed.

11:33.410 --> 11:34.860
Come with mommy.

11:35.200 --> 11:36.450
Come on.

11:37.530 --> 11:38.650
Think about it, honey.

11:47.490 --> 11:49.400
After having dinner
with her parents

11:49.490 --> 11:52.240
the little girl quietly
brushed her teeth

11:52.320 --> 11:54.480
looking at herself in the mirror

11:54.570 --> 11:55.940
thinking back on her day.

11:59.070 --> 12:01.610
She put on her favorite pajamas

12:01.690 --> 12:04.230
"got into her cozy, little bed

12:04.320 --> 12:06.690
"convinced she had seen
that tape

12:06.780 --> 12:08.870
"come out
of the tummy of the hog.

12:11.730 --> 12:15.110
That night the little girl
had funny nightmares."

12:17.280 --> 12:18.820
That's it.

12:18.900 --> 12:22.560
- I like this book.
- I know.

12:22.650 --> 12:25.190
It's time for you
to go to bed. It's late.

12:27.230 --> 12:28.440
Goodnight.

12:36.350 --> 12:37.640
I saw that tape.

13:16.020 --> 13:18.970
 Tell Zog he's wasting film.
He shoots too much.

13:19.440 --> 13:21.480
He'll push us over budget.

13:21.560 --> 13:23.220
I'll tell him.

13:23.600 --> 13:26.100
Mr. Marshall says that you
must reduce your consumption

13:26.180 --> 13:29.140
of film or else
you'll go over budget.

13:29.220 --> 13:32.890
You tell him that it is very
tricky to film children.

13:32.970 --> 13:36.720
Reality is only 7, it's the first
time she's been in a movie.

13:36.810 --> 13:38.650
I have to adapt to her rhythms.

13:39.930 --> 13:42.140
He says filming kids is tricky.

13:42.220 --> 13:43.680
That's no excuse.

13:43.760 --> 13:47.180
Why keep on filming such a crappy shot?

13:48.180 --> 13:51.760
The kid's just lying in bed!
Why film her?

13:52.970 --> 13:56.880
He is asking why the camera is still
rolling for such a crappy shot?

13:56.970 --> 13:59.630
I was simply waiting
for her to fall asleep.

13:59.720 --> 14:02.430
I think she was struggling to
fall asleep because of the lights

14:02.510 --> 14:05.170
and the presence of the crew,
and it's not a crappy shot

14:05.260 --> 14:07.220
it is a crucial moment.

14:07.300 --> 14:11.000
She gently falls asleep
and her nightmare begins.

14:12.340 --> 14:14.540
He was waiting for her to fall asleep.

14:14.630 --> 14:15.630
Why?

14:16.130 --> 14:18.710
She doesn't have to sleep!
It's a movie.

14:18.800 --> 14:21.140
She can fake it.
That's what movies are!

14:21.210 --> 14:24.880
It costs money to keep rolling, dammit!

14:27.380 --> 14:30.870
Mr. Marshall, your
appointment is here.

14:31.630 --> 14:32.720
Yes.

14:32.790 --> 14:36.370
I'll see him when we're done.
Have him wait in my office.

14:36.460 --> 14:37.830
Very good, sir.

14:38.830 --> 14:40.120
Give him a fruit.

14:41.710 --> 14:42.960
Certainly.

14:47.500 --> 14:51.540
There you go.
She falls asleep. For real.

14:52.620 --> 14:55.830
She falls asleep for real.

14:55.910 --> 14:57.200
About time!

15:22.540 --> 15:26.240
I'm all yours.

15:26.330 --> 15:28.410
- How are you doing?
- Perfect.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.750
How long's it been?

15:32.830 --> 15:34.450
Ten years?

15:34.540 --> 15:36.250
That's right!

15:36.660 --> 15:38.280
You've hardly changed physically,

15:38.370 --> 15:40.030
I dyed my hair, that's all.

15:42.490 --> 15:43.660
- So?
- Yes!

15:44.070 --> 15:46.280
You've brought me something to read.

15:46.370 --> 15:48.500
Well... No.

15:48.570 --> 15:52.740
 I finally decided
to talk you through it because...

15:52.820 --> 15:56.110
Reading makes it seem complicated.

15:56.200 --> 15:57.700
Complicated?

15:58.070 --> 15:59.690
What's it about, brain surgery?

15:59.780 --> 16:01.150
No, no...

16:01.400 --> 16:02.400
Anything but!

16:02.490 --> 16:03.990
Good. Here.

16:04.530 --> 16:05.780
Have a cigar.

16:05.860 --> 16:07.360
No, thanks.

16:07.440 --> 16:08.940
Do, please.

16:09.030 --> 16:12.490
It's not my thing.
I'm not feeling my best, either.

16:12.570 --> 16:14.330
don't be a jerk.
These little ones are tasty.

16:15.520 --> 16:17.980
Mexican.
They dry them for four years!

16:19.440 --> 16:21.350
This beauty cost megabucks.

16:21.440 --> 16:23.140
Really, I don't like cigars.

16:23.690 --> 16:26.770
Have a cigarette at least.
I keep them, for non-smokers.

16:26.850 --> 16:30.310
don't be shy!
I'll light it for you, see?

16:35.060 --> 16:36.180
- Thanks.
- There you go.

16:39.100 --> 16:40.850
Aren't we more relaxed?

16:41.230 --> 16:42.310
True.

16:42.890 --> 16:44.060
True.

16:44.770 --> 16:48.720
 So, your movie.
Tell me, when is it set?

16:48.810 --> 16:52.970
It's set... In the present day.
Right now.

16:53.310 --> 16:55.560
Okay.
Do you have a title?

16:59.060 --> 17:00.110
Meaning what?

17:00.810 --> 17:04.060
Waves, like "microwaves."

17:04.140 --> 17:06.470
Okay. "Waves."

17:06.560 --> 17:07.770
Whatever.

17:07.849 --> 17:09.390
Carry on. It's set in the present.

17:10.510 --> 17:12.670
Yes, smack in the present.

17:12.760 --> 17:14.630
Stop, sorry. Give me that.

17:15.720 --> 17:18.170
You smoke so badly, it's annoying.

17:18.260 --> 17:22.550
- I'm not used to...
- It's no fun unless you do it right.

17:22.630 --> 17:25.210
How about we talk outside?

17:25.300 --> 17:26.920
Some fresh air?

17:27.010 --> 17:28.720
Yes, it's rather hot in here.

17:29.170 --> 17:31.750
Precisely. This room is poorly aired.

17:33.710 --> 17:37.170
I'll be on the deck,
doing business with a young director.

17:37.590 --> 17:39.000
No calls, please.

17:39.090 --> 17:40.090
Come on.

17:41.210 --> 17:43.460
Funny, you were the receptionist before.

17:43.540 --> 17:44.750
Yes.

17:45.090 --> 17:47.470
Now you're bringing me a project.

17:47.540 --> 17:49.000
Isn't life amazing?

17:53.170 --> 17:54.630
Give me a second.

17:55.630 --> 17:56.720
Hey Zog!

17:59.080 --> 18:00.370
Less film!

18:00.710 --> 18:03.010
- What'd he say?
- He said, less film.

18:03.080 --> 18:06.580
Oh, tell him to go fuck himself.
I'll film as much as I want.

18:06.660 --> 18:08.450
He says, he will try!

18:08.540 --> 18:11.950
We need to know
what's on the tape!

18:12.290 --> 18:14.790
- Who's he?
- An ex-documentary maker.

18:14.870 --> 18:17.830
I picked him out of the gutter.

18:17.910 --> 18:21.070
He's a handful, but talented.
His movie is stunning.

18:22.540 --> 18:26.710
He lets the camera roll too long,
but he's good.

18:28.370 --> 18:32.370
It's hard to relax, standing up.

18:32.450 --> 18:33.660
don't you think?

18:33.990 --> 18:35.320
I don't know.

18:42.490 --> 18:44.110
This is better.

18:44.990 --> 18:47.280
I'm dying to hear what you've got.

18:47.360 --> 18:48.530
Sit down.

18:49.280 --> 18:51.740
- I'm dying to tell you.
- Go ahead.

18:51.820 --> 18:53.260
- It's set in the present day.
- Yes!

18:54.400 --> 18:57.230
Wait a minute.
Do you smell stale tobacco?

18:57.820 --> 18:59.820
Probably because I smoked.

18:59.900 --> 19:03.320
- Isn't it unpleasant?
- It's kind of smelly.

19:03.400 --> 19:05.310
Makes me want to puke!

19:06.610 --> 19:10.560
Okay, I'll shut up and listen.
I’m ready to go.

19:14.440 --> 19:16.150
Let's go!

19:16.230 --> 19:18.100
Right. So...

19:18.520 --> 19:21.520
Like I said, it's set in the present,

19:22.520 --> 19:24.310
contemporary, on earth.

19:24.900 --> 19:26.820
Here's the idea.

19:27.230 --> 19:32.180
We don't know why,
but TV sets suddenly get vicious.

19:33.020 --> 19:34.060
Which TV sets?

19:34.580 --> 19:35.580
All of them.

19:35.910 --> 19:36.820
All?

19:36.910 --> 19:39.280
All tvs, everywhere.

19:39.370 --> 19:40.370
Every TV on earth?

19:40.990 --> 19:41.990
Yes.

19:42.860 --> 19:44.400
Okay, go on.

19:45.360 --> 19:46.400
So...

19:48.570 --> 19:51.190
People don't realize it, but...

19:51.280 --> 19:54.530
The TV sets beam waves at them

19:54.610 --> 19:57.690
that suck out their intelligence
day after day.

19:57.780 --> 20:00.740
They get completely stupid.

20:00.820 --> 20:05.110
The dumber they get,
the more TV they watch,

20:05.190 --> 20:07.650
and the dumber they get, and so on.

20:09.400 --> 20:10.400
Sci-Fi.

20:10.480 --> 20:11.610
Right.

20:12.860 --> 20:14.690
- That's it?
- No.

20:14.770 --> 20:15.810
That's only part one.

20:16.900 --> 20:18.020
After that,

20:18.310 --> 20:22.560
when the waves have made
everyone on earth completely stupid,

20:22.650 --> 20:25.320
the TV sets decide to wipe them out.

20:25.770 --> 20:28.770
And this is where it gets exciting,

20:28.850 --> 20:31.520
they start beaming waves that kill people.

20:32.690 --> 20:34.360
Wow. The whole works.

20:34.440 --> 20:37.900
Right. Everybody on earth dies.

20:37.980 --> 20:40.730
There's nobody left. No survivors.

20:40.810 --> 20:42.100
No hope.

20:43.060 --> 20:44.060
"The end."

20:44.270 --> 20:46.230
No hope? I like it.

20:46.310 --> 20:49.520
Me too.
There's usually a ray of hope. Not here.

20:49.600 --> 20:51.600
That's my idea.

20:51.680 --> 20:54.590
Go back to the tvs.
How do they kill people?

20:54.680 --> 20:56.220
It's a bit unclear.

20:56.300 --> 20:58.590
It's similar to part one.

20:58.680 --> 21:00.770
They beam very strong waves

21:00.840 --> 21:03.090
that burn people up inside.

21:04.220 --> 21:08.010
How do they react?
What do we see on the screen?

21:08.430 --> 21:10.810
They bleed, intensely, all over.

21:10.880 --> 21:13.800
It's sickening. Blood spewing
from their eyes, arms, chests...

21:15.800 --> 21:17.670
Nice! I love it.

21:17.760 --> 21:20.430
- Are they in pain?
- They're in pain. Agony.

21:21.420 --> 21:23.590
I'm impressed. I love it.

21:24.840 --> 21:28.630
But like I said before,
how do we see the pain?

21:29.880 --> 21:32.170
Hold it!
Tell me indoors, okay?

21:32.250 --> 21:33.670
We'll have a cigar.

21:35.960 --> 21:37.540
Come on.

21:37.630 --> 21:38.670
- I love it.
- You do?

21:38.960 --> 21:40.620
- Really?
- Really.

21:41.170 --> 21:43.670
You're not just being polite?

21:43.750 --> 21:45.870
No, I mean it.

21:58.540 --> 22:00.830
Shit! It's filthy!

22:01.750 --> 22:04.090
- Roughly, this is it.
- Just a sec.

22:05.830 --> 22:08.450
Send Daniel with a stain remover.

22:08.540 --> 22:10.090
Something strong.

22:11.370 --> 22:13.660
So, show me. Tell me.

22:13.740 --> 22:15.370
That's roughly it.

22:17.530 --> 22:20.240
- You draw like shit.
- It's a diagram.

22:20.660 --> 22:23.450
The TV beams the waves

22:24.120 --> 22:25.330
towards the person.

22:26.820 --> 22:29.610
He dies because of the waves.

22:29.700 --> 22:36.820
And then... He bleeds his guts out.
See?

22:36.900 --> 22:37.900
Okay, I get it.

22:38.860 --> 22:40.030
But look,

22:40.900 --> 22:41.780
these wavy lines show us the beams.

22:43.280 --> 22:44.780
Yes, it's beaming.

22:46.360 --> 22:48.900
We can't show it on film.

22:48.980 --> 22:51.360
You can't film invisible waves.

22:51.440 --> 22:53.650
How will people get it?

22:54.110 --> 22:58.400
Easy. We'll hear a humming,
like a microwave.

23:00.440 --> 23:02.560
We'll dub it in post.

23:04.480 --> 23:05.350
[Knock on door]
Okay.

23:05.440 --> 23:06.350
Yes?

23:06.440 --> 23:09.190
You asked for me, sir?
For the rug?

23:09.270 --> 23:11.430
It's too late, buddy. I've
already cleaned it myself.

23:11.520 --> 23:13.280
Please, shut the door,
I have an appointment.

23:19.390 --> 23:21.140
I love it.

23:21.230 --> 23:22.820
No kidding?

23:23.440 --> 23:25.730
I really do.
It fills my head with pictures.

23:26.430 --> 23:29.100
Tvs, waves, people bleeding,

23:29.180 --> 23:31.220
no hope, Sci-Fi... I love it.

23:31.310 --> 23:35.310
You couldn't make me happier.
I've been working on this for years.

23:36.270 --> 23:38.270
Can we go back to the pain?

23:38.970 --> 23:42.550
 How do we see the pain
when they start spewing blood?

23:42.640 --> 23:43.890
Tell me.

23:44.720 --> 23:48.470
They groan, I think.
With pain.

23:49.310 --> 23:50.900
How do they groan?

23:51.550 --> 23:53.300
They groan, I think, with pain.

23:53.390 --> 23:55.190
I'm not sure what you mean.

24:07.390 --> 24:08.770
Do it for me.

24:08.840 --> 24:10.420
What?

24:10.510 --> 24:13.260
The groan.
Give me the feel of your film.

24:15.010 --> 24:18.130
Well... I don't know...

24:19.550 --> 24:21.050
Actually...

24:21.880 --> 24:23.210
I haven't...

24:24.550 --> 24:27.500
I don't know exactly...

24:28.050 --> 24:29.460
What kind of groan it is.

24:29.550 --> 24:31.640
To be honest, I didn't think about it.

24:32.380 --> 24:34.130
It's a key detail.

24:35.130 --> 24:37.670
I've been focusing on the plot, but...

24:37.750 --> 24:38.750
You're right,
I should've thought about the groans.

24:42.420 --> 24:44.670
Jason, I know you well enough

24:45.040 --> 24:46.620
to give it to you straight.

24:47.340 --> 24:48.680
I like your project.

24:50.580 --> 24:51.750
I'm game to sign.

24:52.420 --> 24:54.090
Okay. Wow!

24:54.170 --> 24:56.170
I don't know what to say!

24:56.250 --> 24:58.700
don't say, listen.

24:58.790 --> 25:00.990
I'll sign, on one condition.

25:01.080 --> 25:02.830
Find the groan.

25:03.120 --> 25:04.700
It's key.

25:05.200 --> 25:07.120
I want the best groan
in movie history.

25:07.200 --> 25:08.200
Okay.

25:08.290 --> 25:10.210
don't say, “okay.” I'm serious.

25:11.950 --> 25:14.200
I want an Oscar for that groan.

25:15.330 --> 25:16.330
Right.

25:16.540 --> 25:17.670
Fuck the rest.

25:18.040 --> 25:21.330
Do your thing with it,
simplify it, I don't care.

25:22.200 --> 25:24.660
- Wow!
- I'll give you 48 hours.

25:24.990 --> 25:27.490
Get to work.
Call me when you're ready.

25:28.240 --> 25:31.070
If I like the groan, we'll sign.

25:31.870 --> 25:33.410
You'll make your movie.

25:34.780 --> 25:36.240
Is it a deal?

25:58.070 --> 25:59.400
Yes.

29:19.520 --> 29:21.440
Yes?

29:21.520 --> 29:23.310
Are you to old person
that lives in house?

29:23.400 --> 29:24.780
Yes.

29:24.860 --> 29:26.070
Why should I give a shit?

29:50.520 --> 29:52.060
And then what?

29:52.140 --> 29:54.140
That's it.
That's when I woke up

29:54.230 --> 29:56.840
I took out my notebook
and I wrote it all down

29:56.910 --> 29:59.390
and to be honest with you, I don't
know what to think about it.

30:02.950 --> 30:04.660
What bothers you
about this dream?

30:07.120 --> 30:11.780
The military Jeep?
The bouquet of flowers?

30:11.870 --> 30:14.710
Or is it that you're dressed
as a woman, tell me.

30:14.780 --> 30:16.110
None of that.

30:16.200 --> 30:18.950
It's just the presence
of an old man in my dreams.

30:19.030 --> 30:21.320
I'm not used to dreaming about
old people.

30:21.410 --> 30:23.160
I mean I never do that.

30:23.240 --> 30:24.240
What does that mean?

30:24.280 --> 30:26.030
It's really worrying me.

30:26.110 --> 30:28.110
I don't think it means anything.

30:28.200 --> 30:30.660
For me to be honest,
what worries me, Henri

30:30.740 --> 30:33.290
is the length of your dream.

30:34.570 --> 30:36.270
Really? The length?

30:36.360 --> 30:38.520
Let's say it's not
really finished.

30:38.610 --> 30:40.900
It's a very short dream.

30:40.980 --> 30:42.980
You have got me used
to more depth.

30:43.070 --> 30:46.490
Well, yeah. I just woke up
it's not my fault.

30:46.570 --> 30:48.490
Why do you think you woke up?

30:48.560 --> 30:49.560
In your opinion.

30:53.770 --> 30:56.600
Try to stay focused, Henri.

30:56.690 --> 30:58.190
Answer my question.

30:59.560 --> 31:01.690
Why did you wake up?

31:01.770 --> 31:04.810
I just woke up.
There's no reason.

31:04.900 --> 31:06.690
Are you at least sure
you had this dream?

31:11.390 --> 31:13.600
Think about what I just said.

31:13.690 --> 31:15.360
I'll be back in a second.

31:24.020 --> 31:26.690
Can you stop that moronic screaming?

31:26.770 --> 31:28.770
I'm with a patient!
What's the idea?

31:28.850 --> 31:30.640
I'm practicing for my film.

31:30.720 --> 31:33.550
You're a nuisance! Go away!

31:35.100 --> 31:36.310
For god's sake!

31:43.470 --> 31:45.380
Henri, we still have 10 minutes.

31:45.470 --> 31:47.720
I'm good. I think
we had enough for today.

31:47.800 --> 31:50.380
I think, I bored you
enough as it is.

31:50.470 --> 31:52.220
What are you talking about?

31:52.300 --> 31:54.260
Sit down, will you?
We have to finish the session.

31:54.300 --> 31:56.880
No. I'd rather go.

31:56.970 --> 31:59.600
And I'll come back to you when I have
more finished dream for you next time.

31:59.680 --> 32:02.470
I can tell you're not interested
in me at all today.

32:52.260 --> 32:53.220
- Sorry.
- Are you busy today?

32:54.670 --> 32:56.500
What's your schedule?

32:56.590 --> 32:58.510
I have to work.

32:58.590 --> 33:00.470
You mean, recording noises?

33:00.840 --> 33:04.630
Not just noises.
There's more to it...

33:04.710 --> 33:06.580
But whatever. Why do you ask?

33:06.920 --> 33:08.630
You drove my patient away.

33:10.250 --> 33:14.210
At a key moment,
you distracted me and he left.

33:14.290 --> 33:16.830
Sorry hon.
I didn't think you'd hear me.

33:16.920 --> 33:18.510
Stay in your car, please.

33:20.910 --> 33:21.950
Okay, I understand.

33:22.040 --> 33:23.200
All day. I finish at 6.
No screams before then.

33:25.370 --> 33:27.870
- I'll work here, no problem.
- Thanks!

33:28.330 --> 33:29.830
See you for lunch, though?

33:35.950 --> 33:36.950
All right.

33:46.040 --> 33:51.330
Well, okay. You can get dressed again.
I've seen what I wanted to see.

33:51.410 --> 33:53.160
Ah, what is it?

33:53.240 --> 33:55.200
That's exactly what I thought.

33:57.450 --> 34:01.240
It is indeed an eczema attack
but on the inside.

34:02.990 --> 34:04.900
On the inside?

34:04.990 --> 34:07.900
Yes. On the inside
of your head.

34:09.159 --> 34:10.330
What does that mean?

34:10.409 --> 34:12.750
Well, it means a lot
of unpleasant things

34:12.820 --> 34:15.360
that I'm just gonna
keep to myself.

34:15.449 --> 34:18.449
If you wanted a doctor's note,
you came to the wrong place.

34:18.530 --> 34:20.400
You can not play me
for an idiot.

34:20.489 --> 34:22.330
Oh, uh..
What?

34:22.400 --> 34:24.770
Get out of my office now.
Alright?

34:24.860 --> 34:26.139
You've wasted enough of my time.

34:26.190 --> 34:28.110
You are horrible.

34:28.190 --> 34:29.900
Yes, I know.
Thank you for reminding me.

34:29.980 --> 34:31.940
Now, get out, don't come back.

34:32.020 --> 34:33.230
You should be ashamed.

34:33.320 --> 34:34.989
Yeah, exactly I am ashamed.

34:35.060 --> 34:37.190
I can't go to the pool anymore.

34:37.270 --> 34:39.790
People keep looking at me like I
am gonna contaminate the water.

34:39.810 --> 34:41.600
Of course I am ashamed.
Look at me.

34:41.690 --> 34:44.030
I'm sick and you know it.
You've gotta help me!

34:44.100 --> 34:47.679
I can't keep scratching myself
forever, I'm gonna go crazy.

34:47.770 --> 34:49.219
Just stop acting right now.

34:49.310 --> 34:51.389
Because you're not believable
for a second.

34:51.480 --> 34:53.940
You don't have anything
and you know that very well.

34:54.020 --> 34:55.270
So get the hell out of here!

34:55.350 --> 34:56.760
Or I'm gonna file a complaint.

35:06.220 --> 35:07.600
Goodbye.

35:10.060 --> 35:15.270
Groan 44.

35:24.180 --> 35:25.760
Groan 45.

35:47.430 --> 35:50.100
Groan... 47?

36:20.920 --> 36:25.340
 And now, the award for
the best groan in movie history goes to...

36:39.130 --> 36:41.750
What the fuck are you doing?

36:46.340 --> 36:48.500
- Huh?
- It's late! Stop dicking around!

36:48.590 --> 36:50.420
I didn't notice the time.

36:50.880 --> 36:54.290
- What a crazy dream!
- Come on, I'm tired.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.330
Listen to this crazy dream I had!

37:02.420 --> 37:05.250
Tomorrow. I have a free slot at 11.

37:05.340 --> 37:08.720
- Just listen, don't analyze.
- Tomorrow!

37:10.880 --> 37:14.800
Jacques, now that our audience
knows you a little bit better

37:14.880 --> 37:18.170
why don't you tell them about
the dessert that you've chosen.

37:18.250 --> 37:22.870
We are all very impatient
and... and very much listening.

37:22.960 --> 37:27.170
Uh, yes. I've chosen
the strawberry Charlotte.

37:27.250 --> 37:30.620
The strawberry Charlotte, in a few words
tell us about the strawberry Charlotte.

37:32.960 --> 37:37.630
Uh, yes. Well, um, it's a very
simple cake and easy to make.

37:37.710 --> 37:39.250
Can you hurry, sugar pie?

37:39.330 --> 37:40.780
We're leaving in 5 minutes.

37:40.870 --> 37:42.370
Okay. Alright.

37:44.080 --> 37:45.830
And they are not
too gross to touch..

38:46.200 --> 38:47.910
Come on, reality, move it.

38:48.740 --> 38:50.070
We're late.

39:23.410 --> 39:25.210
Oh! Fuck.

39:27.950 --> 39:28.950
God dammit.

39:34.360 --> 39:35.690
Do we have a first aid kit?

39:35.780 --> 39:37.820
Okay. Fuck!
It hurts like hell.

39:37.900 --> 39:39.440
What the fuck were you thinking?

39:39.530 --> 39:40.830
- Argh, I really hurt myself.
- Just...

39:40.900 --> 39:42.400
Wait, alright?

39:42.480 --> 39:43.810
don't move just a second.

39:45.190 --> 39:46.190
Hello?

39:51.230 --> 39:53.610
Um. I just spoke to Denis
on the phone.

39:53.690 --> 39:55.100
Yeah, what's up with him?

39:55.190 --> 39:57.270
He's not getting better.
He can't come in today.

39:57.360 --> 40:01.240
And he didn't sound good at all.
He was crying.

40:01.310 --> 40:03.350
What a fucking pain in the ass.

40:03.440 --> 40:05.310
Apparently, he is itching
twice as much today.

40:11.400 --> 40:13.820
Good morning
this is your captain speaking.

40:13.900 --> 40:15.690
The leper is not
comin' in today.

40:17.230 --> 40:19.210
Let's pack it up people,
this day is over.

40:24.540 --> 40:25.540
Shit.

40:32.950 --> 40:34.160
Hey, hi.

40:35.120 --> 40:36.530
What?

40:36.620 --> 40:37.540
Yeah, we don't know each other.

40:37.620 --> 40:39.830
I am the camera 3 operator.

40:39.910 --> 40:42.000
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

40:42.070 --> 40:43.780
No..
I... I was just wondering..

40:43.860 --> 40:46.990
Do you think you could do the
same scream that you did earlier?

40:47.070 --> 40:48.690
You know when you hurt yourself.

40:48.780 --> 40:51.360
Aah! Could you do
the same?

40:51.450 --> 40:54.450
Scream exact
the same scream again?

40:54.530 --> 40:56.400
No. I don't think so.

40:56.490 --> 40:59.290
Oh, yeah. Okay.
Too bad.

40:59.360 --> 41:00.860
You know I really hurt myself.

41:00.940 --> 41:02.520
Are you stupid or somethin'?

41:02.610 --> 41:03.820
No, I was just asking.

41:03.900 --> 41:05.730
I thought your screaming
was great.

41:07.360 --> 41:08.690
Whatever.

41:09.440 --> 41:10.650
Moron.

41:12.440 --> 41:13.440
I'm sorry.

41:15.570 --> 41:19.200
So, before we look in detail
at its digestive system

41:19.270 --> 41:22.850
there is something really
important we need to understand.

41:22.940 --> 41:27.020
Now, the hog is an
omnivorous animal.

41:27.110 --> 41:29.570
Does anybody know what
omnivorous means?

41:29.650 --> 41:30.900
Uh, I do.

41:30.980 --> 41:31.980
Uh, I know, ma'am.

41:32.020 --> 41:33.850
Okay, serge, tell us

41:33.940 --> 41:36.110
omnivorous, that means
he'll eat everything.

41:36.190 --> 41:38.280
Good. Okay everything.

41:38.350 --> 41:41.010
But what does everything mean?

41:42.140 --> 41:43.760
Can you give us an example

41:43.850 --> 41:46.930
uh, well, he can eat
salad for example

41:47.020 --> 41:49.360
okay good, salad.
Uh, what else?

41:49.430 --> 41:50.760
Rotten fruit.

41:50.850 --> 41:53.100
Good. Rotten fruit. Uh, and?

41:53.890 --> 41:54.930
Mushrooms.

41:55.010 --> 41:56.640
Good. Mushrooms.

41:56.720 --> 41:59.760
Now, some of those
are what are known as plants.

41:59.850 --> 42:01.810
But what else does it eat?

42:03.180 --> 42:06.970
Oh, oh, um..
He also eats other animals too.

42:07.050 --> 42:08.720
Exactly. Animals.

42:08.800 --> 42:11.550
Okay, so this is really
important to remember.

42:11.630 --> 42:13.420
Everybody take your pens.

42:14.550 --> 42:17.960
Good, and I want you to write...
Teacher.

42:18.050 --> 42:20.000
Yes, reality.

42:20.090 --> 42:23.090
A hog can also swallow a
videotape without damaging it.

42:28.510 --> 42:30.050
But it's true.

42:38.800 --> 42:40.720
Whoo-hoo!

44:33.330 --> 44:35.750
What are you doing here?

44:35.830 --> 44:37.000
Nothing.

45:47.370 --> 45:50.490
You know you are not allowed in any
classroom during recess, right?

45:50.580 --> 45:53.670
You broke the rules.
I am very upset

45:53.740 --> 45:56.490
sorry, Mr. superintendent.

45:56.580 --> 45:58.620
I promise that
I won't do it again.

45:58.700 --> 46:00.860
What was on that tape
you wanted to watch?

46:00.950 --> 46:02.700
It's a videotape I found.

46:02.780 --> 46:05.280
It could be that there
is nothing on it.

46:05.360 --> 46:07.940
I just wanted to check.

46:08.030 --> 46:09.650
Let me see it.

46:09.740 --> 46:11.940
No. You'll take it away.

46:12.030 --> 46:14.860
I just wanna see what's written
on it. Give me the tape.

46:14.950 --> 46:16.700
There's nothing written on it.

46:16.780 --> 46:18.530
Well, I still wanna see it.

46:18.610 --> 46:19.900
No!

46:19.990 --> 46:21.580
You'll keep it.

46:21.650 --> 46:24.730
And then I'll never
get to see what's on it.

46:24.820 --> 46:28.320
Reality, give me the tape
or I'm gonna call your parents.

46:30.940 --> 46:33.150
If you call my parents..

46:35.360 --> 46:37.610
Then I'll tell everyone
you dress up like a woman.

46:39.440 --> 46:41.400
Wha..
Wha..

46:41.480 --> 46:42.730
Me?

46:44.730 --> 46:45.980
Are you kidding?

46:46.060 --> 46:47.640
I saw you.

46:47.730 --> 46:49.440
Driving a military Jeep.

46:50.400 --> 46:51.740
Dressed like a woman.

46:51.810 --> 46:53.600
No, you didn't.

46:57.480 --> 46:59.150
Groan 65.

47:02.310 --> 47:04.890
You're still at it?

47:04.980 --> 47:06.570
I can't believe it.

47:07.350 --> 47:10.260
I'm nearly done.
Just re-listening.

47:12.310 --> 47:13.850
Are you satisfied?

47:14.350 --> 47:15.690
Not especially.

47:17.470 --> 47:20.220
Did Kubrick spend hours
recording himself stupid?

47:20.850 --> 47:23.230
This is research. Why stupid?

47:23.300 --> 47:24.430
Am I stupid?

47:24.970 --> 47:26.380
You tell me.

47:26.470 --> 47:31.420
Did Kubrick research his movies
by taping groans in his pajamas?

47:32.720 --> 47:35.760
I don't give a shit for Kubrick.

47:35.840 --> 47:37.800
He works his way, I work mine.

47:38.380 --> 47:40.090
Why shouldn't I work in pajamas?

47:40.170 --> 47:44.090
Take it easy! I'm trying to understand.

47:44.170 --> 47:46.130
You just look a bit silly.

47:46.460 --> 47:47.460
Okay.

47:49.960 --> 47:52.000
Thanks for your support!

47:52.090 --> 47:53.390
Really!

47:54.920 --> 47:57.790
What do I know about movies?

47:58.880 --> 48:00.220
Kubrick, my ass!

48:01.670 --> 48:03.000
Kubrick, my ass!

48:34.670 --> 48:39.090
 And now, the award for
the best groan in movie history goes to...

48:46.750 --> 48:48.130
Jason tantra!

49:08.870 --> 49:13.120
 I can't stand up.
I can’t stand up!

49:13.210 --> 49:15.380
I'm stuck... to the seat.

49:18.580 --> 49:20.200
I'm stuck to the seat.

49:21.330 --> 49:22.580
I'm stuck!

49:24.910 --> 49:26.580
I'm stuck to the seat.

49:29.080 --> 49:30.780
I'm stuck!

49:32.450 --> 49:33.450
Stuck!

49:46.830 --> 49:48.540
Dirty little fuckers!

49:48.620 --> 49:50.420
Flaunting their boards.

49:56.320 --> 49:59.200
Jason tantra's on the line.

49:59.280 --> 50:00.450
What's he got?

50:02.910 --> 50:06.040
Mr. Marshall wishes to know
if you have anything.

50:06.110 --> 50:11.900
Well no, that's the problem.
I'm running around in circles.

50:11.990 --> 50:14.610
Could you tell him I...

50:15.610 --> 50:16.900
I lost track of what I'm looking for.

50:18.200 --> 50:21.040
It's harder than I thought.

50:21.570 --> 50:25.900
I'm scared
I'll miss the 48-hour deadline.

50:26.360 --> 50:28.230
Can Mr. Marshall reassure me?

50:29.030 --> 50:30.370
Hold on.

50:32.480 --> 50:35.560
He is working,
but he's lost track.

50:35.940 --> 50:38.730
He's running around in circles.
It’s starting to scare him.

50:39.070 --> 50:41.410
He's scared he'll go over 48 hours.

50:41.480 --> 50:42.900
He needs reassurance.

50:43.520 --> 50:44.770
So reassure him.

50:56.480 --> 50:58.520
Why don’t you take a break?

50:58.610 --> 51:00.610
It will do you good.

51:02.060 --> 51:04.060
- You think so?
- Yes.

51:04.150 --> 51:07.280
Why not go to the pool
for a change of scene?

51:07.690 --> 51:08.900
No, but...

51:09.150 --> 51:11.280
I don't like swimming.
I'm no good at it.

51:11.730 --> 51:14.680
Then why not a museum or a movie?

51:14.770 --> 51:17.350
There are many enjoyable movies out.

51:17.540 --> 51:19.290
They'll wash your brain.

51:21.870 --> 51:23.030
Yeah, yeah... maybe.

51:23.120 --> 51:24.990
don't stew in your own juice.

51:25.080 --> 51:26.670
You're freaking out.
It's not good.

51:27.830 --> 51:30.370
He can have 24 more hours.

51:30.450 --> 51:33.200
Mr. Marshall gives you 24 more hours.

51:34.780 --> 51:35.700
Great!

51:35.780 --> 51:37.690
I want an Oscar for the groan!

51:38.160 --> 51:40.620
Mr. Marshall says he wants
an Oscar for the groan.

51:41.610 --> 51:43.240
I know.

51:43.320 --> 51:44.940
That's the problem.

51:45.900 --> 51:47.030
Cheer up.

51:47.110 --> 51:48.230
Good luck.

51:49.780 --> 51:51.150
But then...

51:51.780 --> 51:55.320
How long do I have left
including the bonus?

51:57.490 --> 51:58.700
Hello.

53:52.900 --> 53:54.940
There you go.
Enjoy the movie.

53:55.020 --> 53:56.810
What kind of movie is it?

53:56.900 --> 53:58.900
Is it funny or more romantic?

53:58.980 --> 54:01.310
I'm not allowed to answer
that kind of question, ma'am.

54:01.400 --> 54:02.940
You'll see.
Uhhuh.

54:03.020 --> 54:05.060
Can you move along, please.
You're holding up the line.

54:05.140 --> 54:06.270
Okay.

54:06.350 --> 54:07.640
Okay.
Hmm.

54:10.230 --> 54:11.230
Hey.

54:12.600 --> 54:14.220
What?

54:15.680 --> 54:17.470
It's the title of my film.

54:18.720 --> 54:20.550
"Waves."
"Waves."

54:22.390 --> 54:24.600
That's your "awesome" title?

54:24.680 --> 54:26.840
Someone had the same idea.

54:26.930 --> 54:28.680
Sure it's your title?

54:28.760 --> 54:30.840
Yes! I know my own title.

54:30.930 --> 54:33.220
It's "waves." Like microwaves.

54:34.350 --> 54:37.730
It's a good time to change it.
"Waves" sounds awful.

54:37.800 --> 54:39.590
You're kidding! I love it!

54:44.340 --> 54:48.010
Excuse me. Uh, when does
this movie come out? Waves?

54:48.090 --> 54:50.420
It's already out, sir.
It's playing now.

54:50.510 --> 54:53.550
Can you move aside please,
you're blocking the other customers.

54:53.630 --> 54:55.300
Uh, we're gonna
change the tickets

54:55.380 --> 54:57.170
because we're going to watch it
instead. Is that possible?

54:57.260 --> 54:58.100
What?

54:58.170 --> 55:00.630
I'm sorry, it started
45 minutes ago.

55:00.710 --> 55:02.540
Yes. It's alright. It's good.

55:02.630 --> 55:04.790
Doesn't matter.
Can we change the tickets?

55:04.880 --> 55:05.880
As you wish.

55:05.920 --> 55:09.080
 Not if it's started
and it's called "waves!”

55:09.170 --> 55:11.540
I care about it, honey!

55:11.630 --> 55:12.760
Please move along.

55:12.830 --> 55:14.000
Thank you.

55:14.080 --> 55:15.160
Next.

55:15.250 --> 55:17.660
You're a pain!

56:07.040 --> 56:09.330
God! It's my film!

56:09.410 --> 56:10.830
I swear it's exactly my film.

56:30.290 --> 56:31.920
Fuck!

56:31.990 --> 56:35.620
Be quiet!
You're disturbing everybody.

56:35.700 --> 56:37.320
Two years of hard work!

56:37.410 --> 56:39.700
don't blame me!
I didn't want to see it.

56:41.910 --> 56:42.910
See?

56:47.950 --> 56:49.950
It's my film.

57:13.700 --> 57:15.610
I can't take this.

57:19.110 --> 57:23.490
I'm sorry. Listen to me,
you can't watch this.

57:23.570 --> 57:26.860
Uh, this film doesn't exist yet.

57:26.950 --> 57:29.120
I am the director, it's my film.

57:29.200 --> 57:31.950
I just finished the script
and you can't watch it now.

57:32.030 --> 57:33.190
Move!

57:33.280 --> 57:35.410
This film doesn't
really exist yet!

57:35.490 --> 57:38.700
We haven't shot it yet.

57:38.780 --> 57:41.990
So, you can go and see
another movie. Thank you.

57:42.070 --> 57:44.660
- Go?
- The groans are bad.

57:44.730 --> 57:47.480
They're gonna to be better
when I will work on it.

57:47.570 --> 57:50.480
So thank you, can we stop the...
Get out!

57:50.560 --> 57:52.640
- The screening?
- Move it.

57:52.730 --> 57:53.940
- Go!
- Please.

57:54.020 --> 57:56.430
The groans are... are bad.

57:56.520 --> 57:57.600
You don't understand.

57:57.690 --> 57:59.190
Get the fuck out of the way!

57:59.270 --> 58:00.850
I have to work on it.

58:00.940 --> 58:03.150
This movie doesn't
really exists.

58:03.230 --> 58:04.440
Move it.

58:04.520 --> 58:06.000
I'm tryin' to watch
the fuckin' movie.

58:14.020 --> 58:17.650
Work on it. Find the groan.

58:17.730 --> 58:19.480
It's key.

58:19.560 --> 58:22.510
I want the best groan in movie history.

58:22.600 --> 58:24.890
I'm going home.
You're too embarrassing!

58:24.970 --> 58:26.680
Thanks for the fun time!

58:28.560 --> 58:31.190
I want the best groan in movie history.

58:31.720 --> 58:33.340
I mean it.

58:34.220 --> 58:36.470
I want an Oscar for it. You hear me?

58:38.390 --> 58:39.680
Fine.

58:39.760 --> 58:41.090
Fuck the rest.

58:41.180 --> 58:44.180
Do your thing,
simplify it, I don't care.

58:44.260 --> 58:48.300
-  I don't know what to say.
- Take 48 hours.

58:48.390 --> 58:50.520
Call me when you're ready.

58:51.300 --> 58:54.170
If I like the groans, we'll sign,

58:54.800 --> 58:56.550
you'll make your movie.

58:56.630 --> 58:57.880
Is it a deal?

59:03.800 --> 59:07.090
Great to hear you. Jason here.

59:07.170 --> 59:09.300
- Sorry to bother...
- Just a sec.

59:11.340 --> 59:13.250
Weird! It's you on the line.

59:13.960 --> 59:15.000
Sorry?

59:15.800 --> 59:17.550
This is you on the line.

59:22.050 --> 59:23.680
What do you mean? I'm here.

59:27.590 --> 59:28.590
Where are you?

59:29.590 --> 59:31.380
Outdoors, on the street.

59:33.460 --> 59:37.210
An awful thing has happened.
I don't know how to say it.

59:37.290 --> 59:41.330
It's about the movie.
There's a big problem.

59:42.710 --> 59:46.210
I'm not sure how to explain
what happened.

59:46.290 --> 59:48.120
I may even pass out.

59:48.540 --> 59:52.330
Wait! Breathe deeply, don't faint.
What problem, Jason?

59:52.410 --> 59:54.910
Who are you talking to?
I'm here.

59:57.000 --> 59:58.130
Go on.

59:59.120 --> 01:00:01.120
It may sound insane,

01:00:01.830 --> 01:00:04.240
but I just saw my movie in a theater.

01:00:04.790 --> 01:00:06.210
What did you say?

01:00:06.290 --> 01:00:11.280
I know it sounds
crazy, but it's true.

01:00:11.370 --> 01:00:15.700
I just saw my film
in a theater with an audience.

01:00:17.330 --> 01:00:19.830
The film exists. I saw it.

01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:21.910
And it sucks.

01:00:23.950 --> 01:00:25.360
He says he saw his movie,
I mean your movie, and it sucks.

01:00:31.370 --> 01:00:34.370
I had the exact same dream last night.

01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:37.700
I saw my movie in a theater
and tried to stop it.

01:00:38.820 --> 01:00:39.820
That's it.

01:00:40.860 --> 01:00:44.610
- My nightmare.
- Listen Jason, don't panic.

01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:46.120
You're in a bad dream.

01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:48.830
Relax, try not to think about it

01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:50.900
and you'll wake up.

01:00:52.950 --> 01:00:55.990
Hello, Bob?

01:00:56.070 --> 01:00:57.650
Hello? Hello, Bob?

01:01:41.190 --> 01:01:42.100
Fuck!

01:01:42.190 --> 01:01:43.850
Baby, aren't you taping?

01:01:44.860 --> 01:01:47.530
That groan was awesome.
You should tape it.

01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:51.740
Where's the damn recorder?

01:01:51.810 --> 01:01:54.310
Look in the lining of your jacket.

01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:57.650
The hole, you know?
Where you always lose your keys.

01:01:57.730 --> 01:01:59.390
Ah, yes.

01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:01.390
Got it.

01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:03.340
Ha! Okay.

01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:25.570
Damn.

01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:27.120
I've stopped groaning.

01:02:29.910 --> 01:02:31.320
What, honey?

01:02:31.410 --> 01:02:32.610
The pain's gone.

01:02:35.950 --> 01:02:39.150
I didn't tape the perfect groan.

01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:40.320
Shit!

01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:05.870
Excuse me. Hi.

01:03:05.950 --> 01:03:07.490
Hello.

01:03:07.570 --> 01:03:11.730
I need to borrow your rifle,
just for a minute.

01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:15.320
I'm doing research for sounds,
I'm making movies.

01:03:20.860 --> 01:03:24.480
You can take this one.
It's an old thing, I don't use it much.

01:03:25.900 --> 01:03:27.690
Be careful though. It's loaded.

01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:28.780
Okay.

01:03:30.070 --> 01:03:32.530
Hey!

01:03:32.610 --> 01:03:33.890
You're going to be
late for work.

01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:38.190
Shit!

01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:48.820
Who was that guy, daddy?

01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:53.640
- Where?
- Well, there. Outside.

01:03:54.810 --> 01:03:56.310
You were talking to somebody.

01:03:56.390 --> 01:03:57.970
I wasn't talking to anybody.

01:03:58.060 --> 01:03:59.810
Go back to sleep, sugar pie.

01:03:59.890 --> 01:04:02.310
But I wasn't sleeping.

01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:06.220
What is that?

01:04:06.310 --> 01:04:08.150
That must be my alarm clock.

01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:10.720
Well turn it off!
It's unbearable!

01:04:22.510 --> 01:04:24.590
Hey! Hey!

01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:26.260
What are you doing?

01:04:26.350 --> 01:04:27.690
Where are going with that?

01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:30.220
I'm going to watch the tape.

01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:31.470
Not now.

01:04:31.550 --> 01:04:33.470
That isn't the plan.

01:04:33.550 --> 01:04:34.840
For now, you're sleeping.

01:04:34.930 --> 01:04:36.180
But I am sick of sleeping!

01:04:36.260 --> 01:04:37.920
I want to know
what's on the tape!

01:04:38.010 --> 01:04:40.180
Shh, shh, shh. You're going
to wake your parents up.

01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:42.260
Now come on, go back to bed.

01:04:44.130 --> 01:04:46.210
I'm the one who makes
the decisions, right?

01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:49.180
I am so sick of this movie!

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.670
This sucks! What a pain!

01:04:55.750 --> 01:04:57.670
I'd set my alarm, on purpose!

01:04:57.750 --> 01:04:59.460
Why can't I watch the tape?

01:04:59.540 --> 01:05:01.620
Just be a little patient.
Trust me.

01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:06.120
Come on, go back to sleep!

01:05:06.210 --> 01:05:09.160
Nobody's gonna want to watch
this scene where I am sleeping!

01:05:09.250 --> 01:05:11.000
Nobody cares!

01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:12.500
It's for the suspense!

01:05:14.250 --> 01:05:17.160
Close your eyes.
Sleep!

01:05:17.250 --> 01:05:20.250
There you go.
I'm sleeping.

01:05:20.330 --> 01:05:21.830
Great movie!

01:05:23.250 --> 01:05:25.250
Jacques, you are my guest today.

01:05:25.330 --> 01:05:26.910
Yes.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:31.340
You are a school teacher,
you like nature

01:05:31.410 --> 01:05:34.570
you are an avid viewer
of talk shows

01:05:34.660 --> 01:05:37.160
and you collect Russian watches
from the 70's.

01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:38.990
Yes. Exactly.

01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:40.670
You are 54 years old.

01:05:40.740 --> 01:05:44.080
Yes, that's the truth
you are a widower.

01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:45.660
Yes.

01:05:45.740 --> 01:05:48.200
Do you believe in god?

01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:50.700
Hmm? Yes.

01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:53.740
Yes.
Mmhmm.

01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:12.080
So what should we begin with?

01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:14.080
In... in your opinion?

01:06:14.150 --> 01:06:16.650
Maybe we could wash
the strawberries.

01:06:16.740 --> 01:06:18.790
Personally, that's
my favorite part.

01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:22.870
Well, okay.
Let's start.

01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:25.610
Do you have any
special technique?

01:06:25.690 --> 01:06:28.020
Yes.

01:06:28.110 --> 01:06:31.940
I put the strawberries
in a damp cloth

01:06:32.030 --> 01:06:35.320
and then I rub them
ever so gently.

01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:53.610
Jason, wake up! Hey! Wake up,
man. We've got work to do!

01:06:53.690 --> 01:06:55.350
- Jason!
- What's going on with him?

01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:56.610
I don't know, he just fell.

01:06:56.690 --> 01:06:58.280
Hey everyone, I'm here!

01:06:58.350 --> 01:07:00.350
I'm ready to shoot this,
so let's..

01:07:03.100 --> 01:07:06.430
Wake up! Hey, man,
it's not nap time.

01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:07.770
- Jason?
- We got work to do.

01:07:09.180 --> 01:07:10.350
Wake up!

01:07:10.430 --> 01:07:13.010
- Sorry.
- Up.

01:07:13.100 --> 01:07:15.010
Hey! Come on, wake up!

01:07:15.100 --> 01:07:17.180
Sir!

01:07:17.260 --> 01:07:18.760
Hello.

01:07:22.470 --> 01:07:23.590
Hey!

01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:26.010
Woo-hoo!

01:07:26.100 --> 01:07:27.520
Sir! Hey come on, wake up!

01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:31.300
You're missing the movie!

01:07:31.390 --> 01:07:33.980
Sir? Sir?

01:07:35.590 --> 01:07:36.630
Come on, wake up!

01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:38.380
Woo-hoo.

01:07:39.630 --> 01:07:41.210
Wake up!

01:07:41.300 --> 01:07:43.460
Sir? Sir?

01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:46.800
Wake up, dammit!

01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:48.960
I don't have time for this shit!

01:07:49.340 --> 01:07:50.670
Come on, wake up!

01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:53.920
Wake up!

01:07:58.710 --> 01:08:02.670
What's... what's happening?
I'm... I'm confused.

01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:05.680
It is indeed an eczema
attack, but on the inside.

01:08:05.750 --> 01:08:07.580
On the inside of your head.

01:08:09.590 --> 01:08:11.590
Wake up!

01:08:14.750 --> 01:08:17.500
Hey, come on, wake up! Sir?

01:08:58.670 --> 01:09:00.330
Come on. Wake up!

01:09:02.210 --> 01:09:03.620
Ha!

01:09:06.670 --> 01:09:09.260
What's the matter, dude?

01:09:09.330 --> 01:09:10.410
Are you okay?

01:09:11.210 --> 01:09:13.710
 Yeah.
I'm fine.

01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:24.660
Hey, come on, wake up!

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:28.000
Sir?

01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:35.960
Okay.

01:09:42.250 --> 01:09:46.340
We need to talk. Uh, I think
we are the same person.

01:09:49.330 --> 01:09:52.410
I've been having some weird
dreams where I'm you.

01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:56.750
I... I don't know, I know it
doesn't make any sense but..

01:09:56.830 --> 01:10:00.580
I think we are the same person.
I don't know why.

01:11:47.990 --> 01:11:49.740
What's going on?

01:11:49.820 --> 01:11:52.570
She's about to see
what's on the videotape.

01:11:52.650 --> 01:11:54.650
I see that, but it's badly shot!

01:11:55.570 --> 01:11:59.070
We can't see what she's seeing.
Why choose that angle?

01:11:59.820 --> 01:12:02.110
Mr. Marshall says
it is very poorly filmed.

01:12:02.190 --> 01:12:04.360
And he wants to know why you
chose this angle.

01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:06.520
Because it's beautiful.

01:12:07.860 --> 01:12:09.360
Because it's beautiful.

01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:11.110
Okay, it's beautiful,

01:12:11.190 --> 01:12:13.560
but what the fuck is she watching?

01:12:13.650 --> 01:12:16.440
We need to know what's on the tape!

01:12:16.940 --> 01:12:20.060
Bob wants to know
what's on the tape.

01:12:20.150 --> 01:12:21.980
He has to be patient.

01:12:22.060 --> 01:12:25.560
He asks you to be patient.

01:12:25.650 --> 01:12:26.820
My Patience is limited.

01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:34.810
Does he even know what's on it?
Maybe he hasn't thought it out yet.

01:12:35.270 --> 01:12:38.060
Bob is wondering if you
know what is on the tape.

01:12:38.140 --> 01:12:41.060
I know perfectly well
what is on this tape

01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:43.820
but I'm not going to tell him
before he finds out himself

01:12:43.910 --> 01:12:47.320
it'd ruin the surprise.
He has to be patient.

01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:51.080
He says, be patient.

01:12:51.450 --> 01:12:54.950
I'm warning you, Zog.
The more I wait, the more I want.

01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:17.580
-  Hello.
- Hello.

01:14:17.660 --> 01:14:19.450
I want to be locked up.

01:14:19.530 --> 01:14:22.110
I'm losing my grip.

01:14:23.620 --> 01:14:25.620
I need treatment and help.

01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:28.200
Fine.
Come with me.

01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:31.490
This way.

01:14:35.820 --> 01:14:37.030
Here we are!

01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:39.780
Make yourself comfortable.

01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:42.820
- I'll be back in a minute.
- Thanks.

01:14:42.900 --> 01:14:44.980
Shall I take your gun?

01:14:45.070 --> 01:14:46.270
Yes, sorry.

01:15:09.940 --> 01:15:11.440
Mr. Marshall,

01:15:11.530 --> 01:15:13.780
Jason tantra's on the line.

01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:16.900
Will he never give up?

01:15:24.780 --> 01:15:27.030
Keep it short, Jason. I'm busy.

01:15:27.110 --> 01:15:28.520
Sorry to bother you.

01:15:28.610 --> 01:15:35.020
I wanted to warn you
I may be late with the groan.

01:15:35.110 --> 01:15:36.360
What are you doing?

01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:40.690
I have other fish to fry, dammit!
I can't wait forever.

01:15:40.770 --> 01:15:43.350
I gave you 48 hours,
plus a 24 hour bonus.

01:15:43.650 --> 01:15:47.070
You need a week to find a groan.
How long to shoot a movie?

01:15:47.150 --> 01:15:51.180
Yes, but... Everything's
gone wrong.

01:15:52.100 --> 01:15:55.970
Nothing fits.
I need time to get myself together.

01:15:56.770 --> 01:15:59.100
What doesn't fit?
Are you sick?

01:15:59.180 --> 01:16:01.600
It may sound dumb,
but I'm stuck in a nightmare.

01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:04.470
I know it.

01:16:07.350 --> 01:16:09.050
But then again,

01:16:09.140 --> 01:16:13.800
the good news is, if it's a nightmare
I'll have to wake up.

01:16:13.890 --> 01:16:15.890
But...
I don't know when.

01:16:16.390 --> 01:16:22.090
I can't guarantee to deliver you a groan
as long as I'm stuck in the nightmare.

01:16:22.430 --> 01:16:23.840
Good god!

01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:29.600
Does that make sense
if you're not in the nightmare?

01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:30.760
Do you understand?

01:16:32.550 --> 01:16:33.800
Holy shit!

01:16:36.130 --> 01:16:38.340
Jason, I'll put you on hold...

01:16:38.590 --> 01:16:39.590
Hang on a second.

01:16:43.130 --> 01:16:44.840
I'm flabbergasted.

01:16:45.380 --> 01:16:47.710
He's a genius.
A fucking genius!

01:16:48.670 --> 01:16:50.500
Bob says you are a genius.

01:16:52.590 --> 01:16:54.170
You like it?

01:16:54.250 --> 01:16:57.420
I don't know how to tell you,
I'm flabbergasted.

01:16:57.500 --> 01:16:59.750
It's not finished.

01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:02.680
No, but right now
I'm speechless.

01:17:02.750 --> 01:17:04.830
My brain is in my socks
as they say.

01:17:17.130 --> 01:17:18.760
Hello.

01:17:20.710 --> 01:17:22.120
What's that?

01:17:22.210 --> 01:17:25.000
- A suppository, to help you sleep.
- No, no...

01:17:25.330 --> 01:17:29.290
No need. I'm in a nightmare.
I'm already fast asleep.

01:17:30.620 --> 01:17:32.620
No need for a suppository, thanks.

01:17:33.210 --> 01:17:36.210
Come on, now.
It's nothing at all.

01:17:36.290 --> 01:17:37.950
It won't take a second.

01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:40.490
You don't understand.
I am asleep.

01:17:40.580 --> 01:17:44.240
Anyway, can't it wait?
I'm on the phone here, see?

01:17:45.410 --> 01:17:46.950
It's not plugged in, sir.

01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:50.420
Roll over a little. Roll over.

01:17:50.490 --> 01:17:52.990
Please. It will help you relax.

01:17:57.280 --> 01:18:02.570
There! Not so awful, was it?

01:18:02.660 --> 01:18:05.450
Night-night, sleep tight!

01:18:05.530 --> 01:18:07.400
Sleep in my nightmare?

01:18:07.490 --> 01:18:08.650
Thanks a bunch!

01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:12.360
I'll leave you for an hour or so.

01:18:14.860 --> 01:18:17.190
Jason, you still there?

01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:18.780
- Yes.
- Your groan was perfect!

01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:20.790
Your movie is a go.

01:18:20.860 --> 01:18:23.610
We'll sign on Monday.
Till then, rest up.

01:18:24.690 --> 01:18:25.860
What?

01:18:28.860 --> 01:18:29.860
Hello, Bob?

01:18:30.070 --> 01:18:32.070
Bob, what groan?

01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:38.060
There you go.
That's all for today.

01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:40.240
Incredible!

01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:41.950
Really incredible!

01:18:42.020 --> 01:18:44.650
So beautiful, I could cry.
Let me kiss you.

01:18:45.940 --> 01:18:47.270
Thank you.

01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:51.780
Words fail me. I'm speechless!

01:18:54.900 --> 01:18:56.070
Thank you.

01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:15.980
Hey, Zog!

01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:19.270
You're a fucking genius!

01:19:19.350 --> 01:19:20.430
What'd he say?

01:19:20.520 --> 01:19:21.760
He said you're a fucking genius.

01:19:21.770 --> 01:19:22.770
Yeah.

01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:26.190
Thanks!

01:19:26.270 --> 01:19:27.730
His name is Zog?

01:19:27.810 --> 01:19:28.810
Yes.

01:19:28.890 --> 01:19:30.600
Just Zog? No surname?

01:19:30.930 --> 01:19:31.800
Yes.

01:19:31.890 --> 01:19:33.090
Who is he?

01:19:33.180 --> 01:19:35.010
An ex-documentary maker.

01:19:35.100 --> 01:19:37.810
I picked him up out of the gutter.

01:19:38.390 --> 01:19:39.600
He's a handful,

01:19:40.140 --> 01:19:41.600
but very talented.

01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:43.430
His movie is stunning.

01:19:51.140 --> 01:19:53.140
The end

01:20:24.140 --> 01:20:26.520
 Bye, Mr. Marshall.
I'm very happy.

01:20:26.590 --> 01:20:28.840
Call me Bob now.
Get to work, pal.

01:20:28.930 --> 01:20:30.220
Here I go.

01:20:30.300 --> 01:20:32.210
- 48 hours.
- Yes sir!

01:20:32.300 --> 01:20:33.840
- Good luck.
- Yes.

01:20:35.380 --> 01:20:37.090
So...
See you soon, Bob.

01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:13.250
Yes!

01:21:25.550 --> 01:21:28.890
So, do you have
a special technique?

01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:33.540
Yes, I put the strawberries
in a damp cloth

01:21:33.630 --> 01:21:37.680
and then I rub them
ever so gently.

01:21:37.750 --> 01:21:41.040
That way, you don't
damage the skin.

01:21:41.130 --> 01:21:43.220
You could show us,
it would be easier.

01:21:44.920 --> 01:21:46.010
Gladly.

01:21:51.370 --> 01:21:55.540
What's happening?
I'm confused.

01:21:55.620 --> 01:21:57.700
It is indeed an eczema attack

01:21:57.790 --> 01:21:59.120
but on the inside.

01:21:59.210 --> 01:22:01.460
On the inside of your head.
