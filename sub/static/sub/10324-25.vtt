<i>Ernie's Crab Shack was named after three things:</i>

00:07.820 --> 00:09.720
<i>The food they're most famous for...</i>

00:09.820 --> 00:13.250
<i>the type ofbuilding it was</i>
<i>and the owner- Ernie Belcher.</i>

00:13.350 --> 00:16.080
<i>And after 54 years ofbeing in business...</i>

00:16.190 --> 00:18.320
<i>the crabs and the Shack are still around...</i>

00:18.430 --> 00:20.520
<i>but old Ernie's been missin'for years.</i>

00:20.630 --> 00:23.890
<i>And until today, we never thought</i>
<i>we'd find out what happened to him.</i>

00:24.000 --> 00:26.660
It's comin' on! Oh, my God! It's comin' on!

00:26.770 --> 00:30.570
It's comin' on, it's comin' on,
it's comin' on, it's comin' on.

00:30.670 --> 00:32.830
Our <i>Inside Probe</i> is finally comin' on.

00:32.940 --> 00:35.140
- Man, I can't believe they're finally gonna air that.
- <i>[TVOn]</i>

00:35.240 --> 00:38.340
It's been, like, eight years.
I wonder what took 'em so long.

00:38.450 --> 00:41.510
Actually, that's my fault. Now that
I'm no longer in Witness Protection...

00:41.620 --> 00:43.520
I was able to finally sign
the release papers.

00:43.620 --> 00:45.310
Next week, my <i>Wheel of Fortune</i> will air.

00:45.420 --> 00:47.980
All day long
with that Witness Protection mess.

00:48.090 --> 00:49.490
How long you gonna milk that thing?

00:49.590 --> 00:51.580
We all got stories we're proud of.

00:51.690 --> 00:53.590
I went to the prom as a sixth grader.

00:53.690 --> 00:56.360
Now shut up. It's startin'.

Hi. I'm Geraldo Rivera
sitting in for Stone Phillips...

01:03.070 --> 01:05.940
who's recovering from
some pretty serious plastic surgery.

01:06.040 --> 01:08.470
Welcome to another edition of <i>Inside Probe.</i>

01:08.580 --> 01:11.600
Eight years ago, we visited
the small town of Camden...

01:11.710 --> 01:15.080
<i>where a search for the missing owner</i>
<i>of a seafood restaurant...</i>

01:15.180 --> 01:17.810
<i>uncovers some</i> fishy <i>details...</i>

01:17.920 --> 01:20.320
<i>and an</i> ocean <i>of possibilities.</i>

01:20.420 --> 01:23.480
Tonight on <i>Inside Probe-</i> a small-town bar.

01:23.590 --> 01:26.920
<i>A likable restaurant owner,</i>
<i>Ernie Belcher, disappears.</i>

01:27.030 --> 01:30.260
<i>Was it murder? And if so, who did it?</i>

01:30.360 --> 01:33.460
<i>Why would someone want</i>
<i>Ernie Belcher out of the picture?</i>

01:33.570 --> 01:36.870
<i>What surprises do the local police</i>
<i>have in store for them?</i>

01:36.970 --> 01:39.130
And what is this guy talking about?

01:39.240 --> 01:43.140
Two days to find a way
to get four Floridas on time...

01:43.240 --> 01:46.410
and ride out of here for where you
and your sister's bedpost...

01:46.510 --> 01:49.480
wanted me to go in the first place.

01:49.580 --> 01:53.420
Join us for the next 30 minutes
as we probe inside the case...

01:53.520 --> 01:56.820
of the disappearance
of the Crab Shack's Ernie Belcher...

01:56.920 --> 01:59.550
<i>in "Claws of Death: Unknown."</i>

02:06.170 --> 02:08.930
It's back on! It's back on!

02:09.040 --> 02:12.730
## [Theme Plays]

02:12.840 --> 02:15.600
To fully understand
the disappearance of Ernie Belcher...

02:15.710 --> 02:18.540
first you have to understand
the town of Camden.

02:18.650 --> 02:20.550
And to understand the town of Camden...

02:20.650 --> 02:23.170
you have to understand
the people who live here...

02:23.280 --> 02:25.910
in this town
nestled in the heart of America.

02:26.020 --> 02:27.720
- [Horn Honks]
- [Earl] Hey, "Gerardo"!

<i>Earl Jehosophat Hickey.</i>

02:34.130 --> 02:36.030
<i>Born and raised in Camden County...</i>

02:36.130 --> 02:38.890
<i>Earl epitomizes the Camden experience.</i>

02:39.000 --> 02:41.990
<i>Brought into the world</i>
<i>as an innocent young child...</i>

02:42.100 --> 02:45.400
<i>full ofhopes and dreams,</i>
<i>only to eventually realize...</i>

02:45.510 --> 02:48.530
<i>he is stuck in this dead-end town</i>
<i>for the rest ofhis life.</i>

02:48.640 --> 02:50.540
<i>Hope turns to despair.</i>

02:50.640 --> 02:52.540
<i>And often in towns like this...</i>

02:52.650 --> 02:54.910
- <i>crime is seen as the only way out.</i>
- <i>[Siren Wails]</i>

02:55.020 --> 02:57.850
- <i>And Mr. Hickey is no stranger to crime...</i>
- <i>[Police Radio Chatter]</i>

02:57.950 --> 03:00.390
<i>With 77 misdemeanors under his belt.</i>

03:00.490 --> 03:03.180
<i>Hickey steals anything</i>
<i>he can get his hands on...</i>

03:03.290 --> 03:05.590
<i>including, apparently, one of</i> our <i>cameras.</i>

03:05.690 --> 03:08.090
Whoo-hoo! Look at me!

03:08.200 --> 03:10.630
I'm Gerardo!
[Laughs]

03:10.730 --> 03:13.260
<i>And when he's not committing petty thefts...</i>

03:13.370 --> 03:16.460
<i>he's at his favorite restaurant,</i>
<i>Ernie's Crab Shack...</i>

03:16.570 --> 03:19.510
<i>enjoying his favorite food-beer.</i>

03:20.670 --> 03:23.700
Everyone loved Ernie. He was funny.

03:23.810 --> 03:26.610
Sometimes when you weren't
lookin', he'd drop a peanut in your beer.

03:26.710 --> 03:28.610
<i>Then when you'd get</i>
<i>to the end of your beer...</i>

03:28.720 --> 03:31.910
<i>you'd be, like, "Whoa, where'd</i>
<i>that peanut come from?"</i>

03:32.020 --> 03:34.450
<i>Sure enough, every time, you'd look up...</i>

03:34.560 --> 03:36.650
<i>and there'd be old Ernie</i>
<i>with a smile on his face.</i>

03:36.760 --> 03:39.490
Like that dude who ate a canary.

03:39.590 --> 03:41.490
<i>[Geraldo Narrating]</i>
<i>Randy Hickey-</i>

03:41.600 --> 03:44.760
<i>the younger and, if you can believe it,</i>
<i>stupider brother of Earl Hickey.</i>

03:44.870 --> 03:49.130
<i>Randall Doo Hickey</i>
<i>was Camden County's first ever...</i>

03:49.240 --> 03:51.530
<i>unintentional underwater birth.</i>

03:51.640 --> 03:54.610
<i>At an early age, he developed</i>
<i>a love for guns...</i>

03:54.710 --> 03:57.110
<i>smashing things with shovels...</i>

03:57.210 --> 03:59.510
<i>and balancing things on his head.</i>

03:59.610 --> 04:02.380
<i>But eventually,</i>
<i>Randy turned to crime as well.</i>

04:02.480 --> 04:05.610
<i>Also with 77 misdemeanors under his belt...</i>

04:05.720 --> 04:10.380
<i>Randy is a classic example</i>
<i>of"Dummy see, dummy do."</i>

04:10.490 --> 04:14.860
<i>Like everyone in this town,</i>
<i>Randy has his own fond memories of Ernie.</i>

04:14.960 --> 04:17.490
Ernie taught me how to tie my shoes.

04:17.600 --> 04:20.730
I've known him for a long time-
almost two years.

04:20.830 --> 04:23.460
Ernie used to let me play
the claw machine for free.

04:23.570 --> 04:27.200
<i>But if I got a prize bigger than my fist,</i>
<i>I had to throw it back.</i>

04:27.310 --> 04:30.330
<i>I don't know where he went,</i>
<i>but I'm sure he'll come home soon.</i>

04:30.440 --> 04:33.640
Sometimes people just go away for a while.

04:33.750 --> 04:36.220
Aliens take 'em for a ride
on their spaceship.

04:36.320 --> 04:38.550
<i>I'm always on the lookout for aliens.</i>

04:38.650 --> 04:40.550
<i>I'm not scared of'em.</i>

04:40.650 --> 04:43.320
<i>I just wanna make sure</i>
<i>I don't miss my turn to take a ride.</i>

04:43.420 --> 04:47.260
Randy! Are those your toenails
in the ice cube tray?

04:47.360 --> 04:50.820
<i>[Geraldo Narrating]</i>
<i>Joy Farrah Hickey- wife of Earl Hickey.</i>

04:50.930 --> 04:54.700
<i>Born Joy Farrah Darville,</i>
<i>this blonde-haired, blue-eyed beauty...</i>

04:54.800 --> 04:57.000
<i>always had dreams of stardom.</i>

04:57.100 --> 05:02.010
<i>But when those dreams faded,</i>
<i>she, too, turned to a life of crime.</i>

05:02.110 --> 05:04.840
<i>This low-rent Bonnie</i>
<i>to Hickey's half-wit Clyde...</i>

05:04.950 --> 05:09.250
<i>has a rap sheet with crimes ranging from</i>
<i>impersonating the handicapped...</i>

05:09.350 --> 05:12.680
<i>huffing stolen paint</i>
<i>and robbing the Afro Hut.</i>

05:12.790 --> 05:16.880
<i>We caught up with Joy at her home</i>
<i>in the Pimmit Hills Trailer Park.</i>

05:17.930 --> 05:19.830
<i>[Joy]</i>
<i>I knew Ernie...</i>

05:19.930 --> 05:22.450
<i>but I didn't know Ernie</i>
<i>as good as everybody else.</i>

05:22.560 --> 05:25.090
I'm not originally from Camden.

05:25.200 --> 05:29.030
I grew up one town over, in Nathanville-
much classier.

05:29.140 --> 05:32.470
<i>My family owns a very successful</i>
<i>water bed business.</i>

05:32.570 --> 05:34.800
<i>Anyway, Ernie was cool.</i>

05:34.910 --> 05:39.000
<i>One time, this drunk guy</i>
<i>tried to dry-hump me in the parking lot-</i>

05:39.110 --> 05:42.480
- <i>[Heavy Breathing]</i>
- <i>while I was bendin'over</i>
<i>picking up this nickel I found.</i>

05:42.580 --> 05:45.280
Ernie sprayed him with a water hose.

05:45.390 --> 05:48.250
He was always there for his customers.

05:48.360 --> 05:49.950
Oh, yeah. Ernie.

05:50.060 --> 05:53.960
That crazy son of a bitch
was always sprayin' me with a hose.

05:54.060 --> 05:55.960
<i>[Geraldo Narrating]</i>
<i>If you recognize this man...</i>

05:56.060 --> 06:00.120
<i>you may be among the dozens who have</i>
<i>enjoyed his work on the small screen.</i>

06:00.230 --> 06:03.400
<i>He is Camden County's own TV's Tim Stack.</i>

06:03.500 --> 06:05.600
<i>Supposedly born in Camden County...</i>

06:05.710 --> 06:09.970
<i>Tim was found naked,</i>
<i>except for a diaper, in a cucumber patch.</i>

06:10.080 --> 06:12.340
<i>He was 14 years old.</i>

06:12.450 --> 06:16.040
<i>Taken in by former FatherJoe</i>
<i>and former Father Ed...</i>

06:16.150 --> 06:20.020
<i>Tim has blocked out</i>
<i>nearly every memory ofhis childhood...</i>

06:20.120 --> 06:23.520
<i>and now considers himself</i>
<i>to have a healthy addiction to vodka.</i>

06:23.620 --> 06:25.850
I liked Ernie. We had a deal.

06:25.960 --> 06:29.550
I used to do a little dinner theater
here a couple nights a week...

06:29.660 --> 06:32.760
and he wouldn't bother me
when I needed to use the bathroom...

06:32.870 --> 06:35.800
to, uh, "powder my nose"...

06:35.900 --> 06:38.930
with a little <i>white lightning.</i>

06:39.040 --> 06:42.200
Let's just say it used to
<i>snow</i> a lot back in the day.

06:43.240 --> 06:45.300
I'm talking about cocaine.

06:47.280 --> 06:49.580
Tim, man, what was that pill you gave me?

06:49.680 --> 06:52.020
I don't know. What color was it?

06:52.120 --> 06:54.750
Is this real life, man?

06:54.860 --> 06:56.910
Is it gonna be like this forever?

06:57.020 --> 06:59.790
[Screaming]

<i>[Geraldo Narrating]</i>
<i>Wilfrid Dierkes- Tim Stack's agent.</i>

07:02.660 --> 07:05.630
<i>Wilfrid Dierkes</i>
<i>was a weird little kid...</i>

07:05.730 --> 07:08.500
<i>who grew into</i>
<i>a morbidly obese teenager...</i>

07:08.600 --> 07:11.400
<i>who shrunk back into a weird little adult.</i>

07:11.510 --> 07:15.000
Yeah. Tim's a pretty good actor,
and I've got an online law degree.

07:15.110 --> 07:17.470
We got a little side business
where Tim does slip-and-falls...

07:17.580 --> 07:19.480
and I settle things out of court.

07:19.580 --> 07:21.480
Last year, we did close to four figures...

07:21.580 --> 07:24.350
which pretty much covered
Tim's medical bills.

07:24.450 --> 07:26.610
Wilfrid, this one didn't go through either.

07:26.720 --> 07:28.950
I think it's your library card.

<i>[Geraldo Narrating]</i>
<i>Darnell Turner-A.K.A. "The Crabman."</i>

07:32.330 --> 07:35.560
<i>Ernie's favorite employee</i>
<i>was evasive about his past...</i>

07:35.660 --> 07:37.560
<i>which could only mean one thing.</i>

07:37.660 --> 07:39.150

Witness Protection.

<i>But he could not deny that</i>

<i>than anyone else in Camden.</i>

07:44.600 --> 07:47.000
Ernie was a genius.
He understood that if you introduced...

07:47.110 --> 07:50.080
a very low grade of seafood
to a population a little bit at a time...

07:50.180 --> 07:53.080
peoples' stomachs would adapt-
and he was right.

07:53.180 --> 07:56.240
You should see some of the stuff we serve.
Basically it's chum.

07:56.350 --> 07:58.380
Aside from coworkers
and the regular customers...

07:58.490 --> 08:00.390
did Ernie have any other friends?

08:00.490 --> 08:03.460
Oh, yeah. He was really good friends
with Michael Waltrip.

08:03.560 --> 08:05.490
<i>[Geraldo Narrating]</i>
<i>NASCAR's Michael Waltrip...</i>

08:05.590 --> 08:08.860
<i>an unlikely friend</i>
<i>to this small-town restauranteur.</i>

08:08.960 --> 08:13.260
<i>While in Camden, Michael Waltrip</i>
<i>likes to stay at the Palm Motel...</i>

<i>where, according to their brochure...</i>

<i>if a hooker comes to your room by mistake...</i>

08:18.000 --> 08:20.060
<i>you don't have to pay her.</i>

08:20.170 --> 08:23.800
I met Ernie at a autograph signing
at a NAPA auto parts store in Mount Trace.

08:23.910 --> 08:25.380
<i>And wejust hit it off.</i>

08:25.480 --> 08:27.500
<i>After that, we started hangin'out</i>
<i>whenever I came through town.</i>

08:27.610 --> 08:29.310
<i>He really understood me.</i>

08:29.420 --> 08:32.510
We both had brothers that competed with us
in the same business.

08:32.620 --> 08:35.320
My brother, Darrell,
was a race car driver also.

08:35.420 --> 08:38.410
And his brother, Quizno-
he invented the toasted sub.

08:38.530 --> 08:40.620
So how'd you guys blow off steam together?

08:40.730 --> 08:42.630
Walk me through a typical day...

08:42.730 --> 08:45.060

and Michael Waltrip.

08:45.170 --> 08:48.760
<i>Oh, pool, pinball, makin'left-hand turns.</i>

08:48.870 --> 08:50.630
<i>You know, guy stuff.</i>

08:50.740 --> 08:53.600
<i>Aside from you, is there anyone else</i>
<i>special in Ernie's life?</i>

08:53.710 --> 08:58.300
Oh, yeah. Ernie had some lady friends
he was very fond of.

08:58.410 --> 09:02.580
<i>[Geraldo Narrating]</i>
<i>One of those women was Catalina Rana Aruca...</i>

09:02.680 --> 09:04.670
<i>Camden County's first hot immigrant.</i>

<i>Catalina was born in the small town</i>
<i>of Guadalatucky...</i>

<i>was daytime hooker</i>
<i>Patricia Michelle Weezmer.</i>

09:27.710 --> 09:29.610
<i>on an Indian reservation...</i>

<i>before her mother divorced her father,</i>
<i>Chasing Squirrel...</i>

<i>and moved to their new home in Camden.</i>

09:35.420 --> 09:39.980
<i>Patty splits her time between selling</i>
<i>her body to strangers during the day...</i>

09:40.090 --> 09:43.680
<i>and starring in local community theater</i>
<i>productions in the evening.</i>

09:43.790 --> 09:48.390
Ernie was the best-
quick, clean, very polite.

09:48.500 --> 09:50.550
"No" really meant "no" with him.

09:50.660 --> 09:53.060
We both kinda dated Ernie as a team.

09:53.170 --> 09:55.930
<i>He'd come see me dance for a while,</i>
<i>get all worked up...</i>

09:56.040 --> 09:58.230
<i>and then take Patty out in the parking lot.</i>

09:58.340 --> 10:01.900
She'd shake up the bottle, and I'd pop the cork.
[Pops Lips]

10:02.010 --> 10:04.810
It seemed as if everyone loved Ernie...

10:04.910 --> 10:07.400
and they thought Ernie
would be around forever.

10:07.510 --> 10:12.750
And that was true,
if by "forever" they meant April 9, 2001.

10:12.850 --> 10:14.750
<i>It was a pretty quiet morning.</i>

10:14.860 --> 10:18.420
Um, Officer Lisa-

10:18.530 --> 10:21.430
I don't know her last name.
She's around here somewhere.

10:21.530 --> 10:25.190
- Tall, decent face. Small boobies.
- Oh.

10:25.300 --> 10:29.200
Anyway, she had brought in some bagels
with pumpkin cream cheese. Delicious.

10:29.300 --> 10:32.860
<i>It's like a little pumpkin pie,</i>
<i>but a bagel, you know, so it's good for you.</i>

10:32.970 --> 10:35.440
<i>We werejust enjoying the heck</i>
<i>out of those things.</i>

10:35.540 --> 10:36.940
- [Ringing]
- <i>Then the phone started lightin'up.</i>

10:37.040 --> 10:39.010
<i>[Woman On Tape]</i>

10:53.030 --> 10:54.930
<i>[Man On Tape]</i>

11:08.710 --> 11:10.730
- <i>[Beeps]</i>
- <i>[Woman On Tape]</i>

11:10.840 --> 11:12.740
- <i>[Randy On Tape]</i>
<i>Baba Booey! Baba Booey!</i>
- <i>[Beeps]</i>

11:12.850 --> 11:15.080
It's police policy not to waste resources...

11:15.180 --> 11:17.550
Iooking for a missing person
in the first 24 hours...

11:17.650 --> 11:19.550
because they usually show up on their own.

11:19.650 --> 11:22.650
<i>And after 24 hours,</i>
<i>if they're still missing...</i>

11:22.760 --> 11:25.730
usually means they're dead, so we don't look
for them that hard then either.

11:25.830 --> 11:27.820
- Are you wearing makeup?
- No.

11:27.930 --> 11:30.400
Anyway, when Ernie didn't show up,
we started to think the worst-

11:30.500 --> 11:32.430
murder.

11:35.740 --> 11:38.000
- You're wearing makeup.
- Fine. Yes. I am.

11:38.100 --> 11:41.470
You saw me on <i>Cops.</i>
I looked like I hadn't slept in weeks.

11:41.580 --> 11:43.740
<i>[Geraldo On TV]</i>
<i>Could Ernie have been killed?</i>

11:43.840 --> 11:46.240
It's possible. But if so, by who?

11:46.350 --> 11:48.250
In a town where all the Little League teams...

11:48.350 --> 11:52.610
are sponsored by bail bondsmen,
pawnshops and methadone clinics...

11:52.720 --> 11:54.980
how do you narrow down the suspects?

11:55.090 --> 11:57.110
<i>Was it the petty thief...</i>

11:57.220 --> 11:58.920
<i>his simpleton brother...</i>

11:59.030 --> 12:01.190
<i>the stay-at-trailer mom...</i>

12:01.290 --> 12:03.160
<i>the black coworker...</i>

12:03.260 --> 12:05.030
<i>the immigrant stripper...</i>

12:05.130 --> 12:07.120
<i>the so-called "celebrity"...</i>

12:07.230 --> 12:09.170
<i>the small-time agent...</i>

12:09.270 --> 12:10.600
<i>the black coworker...</i>

12:10.700 --> 12:12.430
<i>or the daytime hooker?</i>

12:12.540 --> 12:15.770
We'll learn more when <i>Inside Probe</i> returns.

12:18.410 --> 12:22.040
- Did they just show me twice?
- I don't think so.

12:22.150 --> 12:24.140
I think they showed me twice.

12:27.490 --> 12:29.850
## [Theme Plays]

12:29.960 --> 12:31.650
Now back to our story.

12:31.760 --> 12:35.560
Eight years ago,
local Camden restauranteur Ernie Belcher...

12:35.660 --> 12:37.630
<i>vanished without a trace.</i>

12:37.730 --> 12:42.230
<i>The problem was figuring out</i>
<i>which small-town lowlife was responsible.</i>

12:42.340 --> 12:44.900
With no motive, no body...

12:45.010 --> 12:47.570
and a police department fishing trip looming...

12:47.670 --> 12:50.840
Ernie Belcher's case looked like
it was going to be closed.

12:50.940 --> 12:52.840
But then police caught a break.

12:54.650 --> 12:57.080
Uh, we were just going through the victim's
office. You know, standard procedure.

12:57.180 --> 12:59.850
<i>We say we're looking for clues,</i>
<i>but it's reallyjust to find stuff...</i>

12:59.950 --> 13:03.480
to auction off at our department fund-raiser.
[Chuckles]

13:03.590 --> 13:07.360
<i>[Geraldo Narrating]</i>
<i>As they tried to raise money</i>
<i>for their break room foosball table...</i>

13:07.460 --> 13:10.360
<i>the police found one thing</i>
<i>they could not auction off-</i>

13:10.460 --> 13:13.190
<i>hundreds of threatening letters</i>
<i>addressed to Ernie...</i>

13:13.300 --> 13:16.460
<i>all from this man- Randy Hickey.</i>

13:19.540 --> 13:24.500
<i>[Randy's Voice] Dear Ernie,</i>
<i>how dare you stop providin'free toothpicks?</i>

13:24.610 --> 13:28.170
<i>What kind ofjerk serves</i>
<i>corn and pulled meat...</i>

13:28.280 --> 13:30.270
<i>and doesn't offer his customers...</i>

13:30.380 --> 13:34.620
<i>a way to get those items</i>
<i>unlodged from their teeth?</i>

13:34.720 --> 13:40.630
<i>Attached is everything I've had stuck</i>
<i>in my mouth for the last two weeks.</i>

13:40.730 --> 13:42.790
<i>I hope you choke on it.</i>

13:42.900 --> 13:45.060
And the threats didn't stop there.

13:45.170 --> 13:47.070
<i>[Randy's Voice]</i>
<i>Dear Ernie...</i>

13:47.170 --> 13:51.000
<i>how dare you only serve my favorite item-</i>

13:51.100 --> 13:54.600
<i>fish wings- on "Wenedsdays"?</i>

13:54.710 --> 13:58.940
<i>I have included a list</i>
<i>of famous people who agree...</i>

13:59.050 --> 14:02.500
<i>that fish wings should be sold every day.</i>

14:02.620 --> 14:06.210
<i>Do as we say, or somethin'bad will happen.</i>

14:06.320 --> 14:08.880
Is it possible that a man
could lose his life...

14:08.990 --> 14:11.650
over toothpicks and fish wings?

14:11.760 --> 14:13.730
That's what police wanted to know.

14:17.160 --> 14:20.390
"Bad things will happen
if fish wings aren't served every day"?

14:20.500 --> 14:22.660
What kind of bad things will happen, Randy?

14:22.770 --> 14:25.170
I don't know. People will be angry.

14:25.270 --> 14:27.670
Fish wings are great.

14:27.770 --> 14:31.970
The only bad part is sometimes
the real chewy pieces get stuck in your teeth...

14:32.080 --> 14:35.170
which wouldn't even be a problem
if they still offered free toothpicks.

14:35.280 --> 14:37.940
But no! Ernie got rid of the toothpicks...

14:38.050 --> 14:40.750
because he said people
were just usin' 'em to poke each other.

14:40.850 --> 14:42.750
[Shouting]
But what he didn't realize...

14:42.860 --> 14:46.310
is that some of us are usin' 'em
to get stuff out of our teeth...

14:46.430 --> 14:48.330
before we poked each other!

14:48.430 --> 14:50.760
Now we're gonna have to poke
each other with our fingers...

14:50.860 --> 14:53.300
while we got fish wings stuck in our teeth!

14:53.400 --> 14:56.860
Damn it! Why are you making me
relive this again?

14:57.040 --> 14:59.130
<i>[Geraldo Narrating]</i>
<i>Obviously full of rage...</i>

14:59.240 --> 15:02.700
<i>police were happy</i>
<i>to have this monster off the streets.</i>

15:02.810 --> 15:06.370
- <i>But even though they had a suspect in custody...</i>
- <i>[Toilet Flushes]</i>

15:06.480 --> 15:09.040
Police were not convinced
that a man who is routinely arrested...

15:09.150 --> 15:12.310
<i>for getting stuck in the return box</i>
<i>while trying to steal videos...</i>

15:12.420 --> 15:15.220
<i>could kill someone</i>
<i>and hide the body all by himself.</i>

15:15.320 --> 15:17.290
So they started looking for an accomplice.

15:17.390 --> 15:19.290
- [Gags]
- [Stomach Gurgling]

15:21.730 --> 15:23.700
<i>[Hoyne]</i>
<i>Would you like a cup of coffee?</i>

15:27.100 --> 15:30.800
Tell me where the hell you and your lowlife
brother were the night Ernie disappeared!

15:30.900 --> 15:32.800
Come on, man. It was night.

15:32.910 --> 15:35.240
I don't know where we were.
We were drunk.

15:35.340 --> 15:37.240
<i>We were getting pretty desperate...</i>

15:37.340 --> 15:41.210
so I had to deploy a somewhat advanced
interrogation technique-

15:41.310 --> 15:43.870
a little thing my grandma called "lying."

15:44.980 --> 15:46.680
Well.

15:46.790 --> 15:48.720
Your brother confessed.

15:48.820 --> 15:51.690
And if you want to get the same deal he got,
you'd better confess too.

15:51.790 --> 15:53.550
Or you're gonna get
the death penalty for sure.

15:53.660 --> 15:55.360
He didn't confess.

15:55.460 --> 15:58.160
You're just trying to get me
to admit something I didn't do.

15:58.260 --> 16:00.890
I know all about reverse biology, buddy.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.200
I'm not an idiot. This isn't gonna work.

16:03.300 --> 16:05.100
Think it'll work on your brother?

16:07.170 --> 16:09.840
My brother said <i>we</i> did it? <i>We</i> killed Ernie?

16:09.940 --> 16:11.740
Yep. He said you guys were drunk...

16:11.850 --> 16:13.610
and there wasn't anything
good on TV that night...

16:13.710 --> 16:16.340
so you decided to go down to the Crab Shack
and take Ernie's life.

16:16.450 --> 16:18.440
- Any of that ring a bell?
- Maybe.

16:18.550 --> 16:21.040
I mean, if he said we did it,
we probably did.

16:21.150 --> 16:23.050
But I don't know.
It sounds a little strange.

16:23.160 --> 16:25.750
There's usually something pretty good on TV.

16:25.860 --> 16:27.760
Randy! Don't do it!

16:27.860 --> 16:31.260
Don't confess! They're lyin' to you!

16:31.360 --> 16:33.230
- <i>[Muffled Pounding]</i>
- What's that?

16:33.330 --> 16:35.820
Oh, that's your brother.
They're bangin' his head against the wall...

16:35.940 --> 16:37.560
until you confess to killing Ernie.

16:37.670 --> 16:40.640
He'll probably die in the next few seconds
if you don't confess.

16:40.740 --> 16:42.770
Then we did it! We killed Ernie!

16:42.880 --> 16:46.110
We killed Ernie!
We killed Ernie! We killed Ernie!

16:47.810 --> 16:50.650
With a trial approaching
and very limited funds...

16:50.750 --> 16:55.650
the Hickey boys were forced
to hire the only lawyer they could afford.

16:55.760 --> 16:58.160
Wilfrid Dierkes- lawyer for poor people.

16:58.260 --> 17:01.460
"Se llamo Espanol."

17:01.560 --> 17:03.460
<i>[Geraldo Narrating]</i>
<i>After a brief negotiation...</i>

17:03.560 --> 17:07.900
<i>that ended with a $35 check</i>
<i>written by us to their lawyer...</i>

17:08.000 --> 17:11.600
<i>the Hickeys agreed to sit down</i>
<i>with</i> Inside Probe.

17:11.700 --> 17:15.440
Your trial's a couple days away.
It doesn't look good. What's your strategy?

17:17.440 --> 17:22.350
Oh. Oh, um, well, with the mustached one,
I'm gonna plead insanity.

17:22.450 --> 17:25.080
And for the big fella here,
I think I'm gonna plead, uh, retardity.

17:25.180 --> 17:26.650
Sounds good.

17:26.750 --> 17:28.780
Gerardo, we didn't do this.
You gotta help us, man.

17:28.890 --> 17:31.520
I can't go to jail.
I had a dream the other night.

17:31.620 --> 17:35.250
I went to jail, then I got out
and got hit by a car and was in a coma.

17:35.360 --> 17:38.730
Me in a coma?
Come on, man. Nobody wants to see that.

17:44.740 --> 17:47.540
With public opinion against them,
a confession...

17:47.640 --> 17:49.970
and a lawyer with a law degree
from Haiti...

17:50.080 --> 17:52.740
the Hickeys looked
to be going away for a long time.

17:52.850 --> 17:54.310
Or were they?

17:54.410 --> 17:58.320
<i>Remember this man-</i>
<i>two-time Daytona 500 winner Michael Waltrip?</i>

17:59.820 --> 18:01.510
Yeah, I remember the night
Ernie disappeared.

18:01.620 --> 18:04.780
<i>[Geraldo Narrating]</i>
<i>Waltrip agreed to reenact that night for us...</i>

18:04.890 --> 18:06.620
<i>with the help of our</i> Inside Probe <i>Actors.</i>

18:06.730 --> 18:10.360
- [No Audible Dialogue]
- <i>[Waltrip]</i>
<i>I was drivin'through Camden between races...</i>

18:10.460 --> 18:14.130
<i>and I thought why not stop off</i>
<i>and see my old buddy Ernie?</i>

18:14.230 --> 18:17.730
<i>I sat in the bar for about an hour or so</i>
<i>catching up with Ernie.</i>

18:20.640 --> 18:22.730
<i>That's about when this drunk woman</i>
<i>offered to flash me...</i>

18:22.840 --> 18:25.310
<i>if I agreed to buy her a beer</i>
<i>and share it with her.</i>

18:25.410 --> 18:27.970
<i>I wasn't drinkin</i>; <i>so I declined.</i>

18:28.080 --> 18:30.170
<i>But she flashed me anyway.</i>

18:32.620 --> 18:35.180
<i>The next thing I know,</i>
<i>the woman's husband is in my face...</i>

18:35.290 --> 18:38.990
<i>demanding that I not only</i>
<i>buy his wife a beer, but I get him one too.</i>

18:39.090 --> 18:40.990
<i>And then his brother-he comes up...</i>

18:41.090 --> 18:44.000
<i>and wants a cheeseburger</i>
<i>for pulling his pants down.</i>

18:45.260 --> 18:47.600
<i>Well, since beers were only a dollar...</i>

18:47.700 --> 18:50.430
<i>I went ahead and bought 'em all one,</i>
<i>along with the burger.</i>

18:50.540 --> 18:53.700
<i>Unfortunately for the woman,</i>
<i>I think that was her "one beer too many."</i>

18:56.110 --> 18:58.010
<i>The other two weren't doin'much better.</i>

<i>But since they were fun,</i>
<i>I decided to hang out with them...</i>

<i>and be their designated</i>
<i>two-time Daytona 500 winning driver.</i>

19:06.090 --> 19:09.890
Fortunately for those guys, I'm a bit
of a shutterbug, and I had my camera with me.

19:09.990 --> 19:12.750
<i>I got a pretty complete record</i>
<i>of what happened that night.</i>

<i>[Geraldo Narrating] With an airtight alibi</i>
<i>from a two-time Daytona 500 winner...</i>

19:17.160 --> 19:21.290
the Hickey boys were released
and sent home to their loved ones...

19:21.400 --> 19:24.200
and <i>Inside Probe</i> was there for the reunion.

19:24.300 --> 19:26.270
We're free!

19:26.370 --> 19:28.360
Hey.

19:30.340 --> 19:32.740
<i>[Geraldo Narrating]</i>
<i>With the Hickey brothers cleared of all charges...</i>

19:32.850 --> 19:35.010
<i>a lot of questions were answered.</i>

19:35.110 --> 19:37.740
<i>A lot of questions except one.</i>

19:37.850 --> 19:40.050
Where was Ernie Belcher?

19:40.150 --> 19:43.050
We thought our visit to Camden was over...

19:43.160 --> 19:48.030
but the more <i>Inside Probe</i> probed the inside,
the more we found.

19:48.130 --> 19:50.790
And you're not going
to believe the things we discover.

19:50.900 --> 19:53.200
<i>Next week on</i> Inside Probe...

19:53.300 --> 19:56.270
<i>the baffling case of Ernie Belcher continues.</i>

19:56.370 --> 19:59.930
<i>So ifhe wasn't murdered,</i>
<i>what did happen to him?</i>

20:00.040 --> 20:02.970
<i>Was it a long-standing historical grudge...</i>

20:03.080 --> 20:06.170
<i>or was it something from out of this world?</i>

20:06.280 --> 20:08.340
And what the heck is <i>this</i> all about?

20:08.450 --> 20:09.570

20:14.220 --> 20:15.690
<i>Inside Probe.</i>

20:15.790 --> 20:18.190
Next Thursday at 8:00. 7:00 Central.

20:20.960 --> 20:25.020
Are you kiddin' me? We have to wait
a whole week to find out what happened to Ernie?

20:25.130 --> 20:26.760
- That's ridiculous.
- I know.

20:26.870 --> 20:29.770
Why didn't they just show the whole thing
in a special one-hour episode?

20:29.870 --> 20:31.800
The network executives
probably didn't order...

20:31.900 --> 20:34.030
enough episodes of <i>Inside Probe</i>
for a whole season...

20:34.140 --> 20:36.040
so they had to stretch it out
over two weeks.

20:36.140 --> 20:38.200
That way, they don't have
to air a repeat during sweeps.

20:38.310 --> 20:41.510
Network executives- they sure take the cake.

20:41.610 --> 20:45.640
Plus they don't let people cuss anymore
on TV until a certain time at night.

20:49.890 --> 20:51.950
Douche bags.
