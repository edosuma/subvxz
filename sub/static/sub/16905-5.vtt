WEBVTT

00:04.526 --> 00:06.595
Hey, Liz. Package for you.

00:14.376 --> 00:15.626
Simon?

00:15.660 --> 00:18.596
Sorry, Liz.

00:19.681 --> 00:21.382
I had no other way
into the building.

00:21.433 --> 00:22.800
And I lost
all my contacts

00:22.835 --> 00:25.019
after I dropped my cell phone
into the penguin exhibit.

00:25.054 --> 00:26.104
Yeah.

00:26.138 --> 00:28.005
I had my birthday
at the Aquarium.

00:28.040 --> 00:29.273
What do you want?

00:29.308 --> 00:31.175
You're not my agent anymore.

00:31.210 --> 00:33.528
I'm still getting your
business mail at my parents' house.

00:33.562 --> 00:35.530
Your contract's almost up,
and Mr. Donaghy's office

00:35.564 --> 00:37.115
sent over that new one
for you to sign.

00:37.149 --> 00:39.484
I'm not just gonna sign
whatever Jack sends me.

00:39.518 --> 00:40.618
That's insulting.

00:40.652 --> 00:41.736
We haven't
even talked about this.

00:41.787 --> 00:44.522
Well, I am
the king of renegotiation.

00:44.556 --> 00:46.391
You watch <i>the Wonder Pets</i>
<i>on Nick Jr.?</i>

00:46.425 --> 00:49.227
I represent the turtle
that tuck is based on.

00:49.261 --> 00:50.211
Yeah.
No, thanks.

00:50.245 --> 00:52.864
I will deal
with this myself.

00:52.898 --> 00:54.132
Did you miss me yesterday,
Ms. Lemon?

00:54.166 --> 00:57.869
Awesome,
great story.

00:57.903 --> 00:59.337
So, Ms. Maroney,

00:59.371 --> 01:00.338
did you miss me
while I was gone yesterday?

01:00.372 --> 01:01.339
You weren't gone.

01:01.373 --> 01:03.341
I saw you.

01:03.375 --> 01:05.476
Kenneth!
Just move.

01:06.728 --> 01:07.979
No...

01:08.013 --> 01:10.448
Mr. Donaghy fired
all the pages for a day.

01:10.482 --> 01:12.550
Didn't you notice your food
wasn't pre-chewed?

01:12.584 --> 01:14.318
J-Mo,
Marty Goldstein

01:14.353 --> 01:15.520
is your accountant too,
right?

01:15.554 --> 01:16.771
I owe him a call.

01:16.822 --> 01:18.055
I bet he's going
to tell me

01:18.073 --> 01:19.090
I can't write off
all my shoplifting.

01:19.124 --> 01:20.441
No.

01:20.492 --> 01:22.743
He's calling you
about his son's Bar Mitzvah.

01:22.778 --> 01:25.246
Marty wants to pay us
crazy money just to show up.

01:25.280 --> 01:26.564
Well, you know I'm in.

01:26.582 --> 01:28.833
Getting paid
to help a boy become a man

01:28.867 --> 01:32.236
is kind of my wheelhouse.

01:32.254 --> 01:34.539
Hey, I have
a bone to pick with you.

01:34.573 --> 01:35.540
Look at this, Lemon.

01:35.574 --> 01:37.708
The Pentagon has hired GE

01:37.743 --> 01:39.277
to weaponize
microwave technology.

01:46.468 --> 01:47.468
This is amazing.

01:47.519 --> 01:49.086
That was my old division.

01:49.104 --> 01:50.471
If I were still there,

01:50.522 --> 01:51.772
I would've controlled
every aspect of that project.

01:51.807 --> 01:53.107
Planning, oversight,

01:53.142 --> 01:55.126
morale-boosting T-shirts
indicating

01:55.160 --> 01:57.028
everyone "survived"
a certain barbecue.

01:57.062 --> 01:59.831
There's nothing to challenge me
here at Kabletown.

01:59.865 --> 02:01.432
Lemon, when was
the last time I said,

02:01.467 --> 02:03.067
"no, senator,
you're out of order"?

02:03.101 --> 02:04.318
Well, I've got something
for you to do.

02:04.369 --> 02:06.838
You honestly thought
I would just sign

02:06.872 --> 02:08.806
the same deal
I got six years ago?

02:08.841 --> 02:10.907
Well, what would we
negotiate about, Lemon?

02:10.943 --> 02:11.909
What do you even want?

02:11.943 --> 02:13.077
Well, for starters,

02:13.111 --> 02:14.846
I would like
a hospital bed in my office.

02:14.880 --> 02:15.963
A real one.

02:15.998 --> 02:16.998
I don't care
if it's against the law

02:17.049 --> 02:17.999
to resell them.

02:18.050 --> 02:19.000
My God.

02:19.051 --> 02:20.635
How far I've fallen.

02:20.669 --> 02:22.186
I used to be a legend.

02:22.221 --> 02:23.855
When there was
a deal no one could close,

02:23.889 --> 02:25.256
they brought in Donaghy.

02:25.290 --> 02:26.491
So it's agreed.

02:26.525 --> 02:28.659
You'll be moving forward
with this partnership.

02:30.512 --> 02:32.063
You know what,
I'm insulted

02:32.097 --> 02:34.015
that you think it's beneath you
to negotiate with me.

02:34.066 --> 02:35.967
Without me,
there's no "TGS,"

02:36.001 --> 02:38.169
so like it or not,
we're getting into this.

02:38.203 --> 02:40.154
Call my assistant
to set up a meeting.

02:40.189 --> 02:41.355
And by your "assistant,"

02:41.406 --> 02:43.574
you mean you
with a British accent?

02:43.609 --> 02:44.808
I have a new assistant.

02:44.826 --> 02:46.977
She's a cool college student
from...

02:46.995 --> 02:48.646
South Africa.

02:48.664 --> 02:50.014
Yeah,
she'll be British.

02:52.000 --> 02:58.074

Sync and corrected by dr.jackson
for www.addic7ed.com

03:12.137 --> 03:14.138
Hello?
I'm back.

03:14.172 --> 03:15.556
What do you mean
"you're back"?

03:15.607 --> 03:18.025
I wasn't here
yesterday.

03:18.060 --> 03:19.176
Yes, you were.

03:19.194 --> 03:20.394
You were in the kitchen
all day.

03:20.445 --> 03:23.915
Right over...
That's a broom.

03:23.949 --> 03:27.952
I know my job
is to serve you all,

03:27.986 --> 03:30.238
but I thought
that after six years,

03:30.289 --> 03:31.389
you at least thought
of me the way

03:31.423 --> 03:33.491
an owner thinks of his dog.

03:33.525 --> 03:34.992
- Kenneth, look...
- No, sir!

03:35.027 --> 03:36.928
I am using my
once-in-a-lifetime interruption

03:36.962 --> 03:40.414
to point out
I am not even a dog to you.

03:40.465 --> 03:41.866
After all,
when a dog goes missing,

03:41.900 --> 03:44.552
everyone's upset
'cause there's no dog milk

03:44.586 --> 03:46.256
for the babies.

03:48.590 --> 03:50.908
Jack wants
a real negotiation?

03:50.943 --> 03:53.711
Well, I want a piece
of the "TGS" merchandising.

03:53.729 --> 03:56.397
The catchphrase,
"this smells,"

03:56.431 --> 03:57.448
I wrote that.

03:57.482 --> 03:58.882
And when 20 cult members

03:58.900 --> 04:01.769
jump off a bridge together
wearing "this smells" T-shirts,

04:01.820 --> 04:03.738
I should get
a cut of that sale.

04:03.772 --> 04:07.291
Merchandising.
That's smart.

04:07.326 --> 04:08.276
Here's the plan.

04:08.327 --> 04:11.395
I need
to find a bathroom.

04:22.808 --> 04:24.759
It's on,
Donaghy.

04:30.415 --> 04:32.133
Here they are!

04:32.184 --> 04:33.934
My favorite clients.

04:33.969 --> 04:35.886
Adam is going to be so excited
to meet with you.

04:35.920 --> 04:37.888
He is a huge, huge fan.

04:37.922 --> 04:40.458
Yes, many of our viewers
are obese.

04:40.492 --> 04:43.227
Now Marty,
how Jewish is everyone here?

04:43.261 --> 04:45.062
'Cause I may need
to change parts of my act.

04:45.096 --> 04:47.481
These are the best clients
you could get?

04:47.532 --> 04:49.233
Don't you represent
Gina Gershon?

04:49.267 --> 04:50.568
My Nemesis?
My Nemesis?

04:50.602 --> 04:51.569
Adam.

04:51.603 --> 04:52.987
You said
you loved "TGS."

04:53.038 --> 04:54.622
I was being sarcastic.

04:54.656 --> 04:56.574
God, I told mom I wanted

04:56.608 --> 04:58.809
<i>Transformer's</i> theme
for Bar Mitzvah.

04:58.844 --> 05:00.944
You know, this sucks.
I hate you.

05:00.962 --> 05:02.747
Son...

05:02.781 --> 05:04.415
Okay.

05:04.449 --> 05:05.416
We're going to go.

05:05.450 --> 05:06.417
Don't worry
about the fee.

05:06.451 --> 05:07.551
You can
just give it to us now.

05:07.586 --> 05:08.786
No.
You're not going anywhere.

05:08.820 --> 05:10.221
If my boy wants
<i>Transformers,</i>

05:10.255 --> 05:11.322
you're gonna be
<i>Transformers.</i>

05:11.356 --> 05:13.024
I don't think so, Marty.

05:13.058 --> 05:14.258
If you don't
help me out here,

05:14.292 --> 05:17.128
maybe the IRS finds out
that your nine dependents

05:17.162 --> 05:18.396
are just vibrators.

05:18.430 --> 05:20.348
And Tracy,
I'd hate for people to realize

05:20.399 --> 05:22.433
that your "charity"
is just a front

05:22.467 --> 05:25.102
that has done nothing
to make this country safer

05:25.136 --> 05:26.520
from Godzilla attacks.

05:26.571 --> 05:28.839
If anything,
I've increased the likelihood.

05:31.860 --> 05:34.078
Hey, Kenneth.

05:34.112 --> 05:35.696
No, I'm not Kenneth.

05:35.747 --> 05:37.882
But he told me
all about you guys.

05:37.916 --> 05:39.717
Let me guess who's who.

05:39.751 --> 05:41.952
You must be Toofer.

05:41.987 --> 05:43.320
I'm sorry,
who are you?

05:43.355 --> 05:46.190
I was asking
myself that same question.

05:46.224 --> 05:47.958
And I did not like
the answer.

05:47.993 --> 05:49.326
So I made a change.

05:49.361 --> 05:51.679
I'm Hazel Wassername,
and yes,

05:51.713 --> 05:54.331
you may recognize me
from one of my two

05:54.349 --> 05:56.183
background acting gigs.

05:56.218 --> 05:58.302
Dr. Lingard,
yesterday,

05:58.336 --> 06:01.522
we heard your daughter
take full responsibility

06:01.556 --> 06:03.674
for her roles
in these crimes.

06:03.692 --> 06:04.809
Where's Kenneth?

06:04.843 --> 06:06.811
He took my spot
<i>the Suze Orman show.</i>

06:07.846 --> 06:08.913
What a first day.

06:08.947 --> 06:10.981
But you got
to roll with the punches.

06:11.015 --> 06:14.452
Just like my hero,
Ivan Drago, from <i>Rocky IV.</i>

06:14.486 --> 06:16.187
This is pathetic.

06:16.221 --> 06:18.189
Kenneth's trying to make us
beg him to come back.

06:18.223 --> 06:20.157
Well,
we are not doing that.

06:20.191 --> 06:21.542
I've learned
from having children

06:21.576 --> 06:24.027
that when your kid throws
a tantrum and holds his breath,

06:24.045 --> 06:25.229
you hold your breath too.

06:25.263 --> 06:27.047
When you regain
consciousness,

06:27.082 --> 06:30.601
believe me, he's ready
to leave the toy store.

06:30.635 --> 06:34.872
Finally, my client
gets 5% gross merchandising,

06:34.906 --> 06:37.725
where gross means
income before expenses

06:37.759 --> 06:40.394
and not gross
like apples on a sandwich.

06:40.429 --> 06:42.213
2% salary decrease
to keep up with deflation...

06:42.247 --> 06:43.213
Thank Obama...

06:43.231 --> 06:46.684
And merchandising is a...

06:46.718 --> 06:47.885
Nonstarter.

06:47.919 --> 06:48.886
This meeting
is over.

06:48.920 --> 06:50.488
When you have
a serious offer,

06:50.522 --> 06:53.324
email me at
tatertotfreak@hotmail.Com.

06:53.358 --> 06:54.942
From now on,
you can deal with me directly.

06:54.993 --> 06:55.960
Simon, you're fired.

06:55.994 --> 06:57.578
Where did
that come from?

06:57.612 --> 06:58.796
Are you being coached?
Is it Pat Riley?

06:58.830 --> 07:00.414
Tell him the funmeister
says, "hi."

07:00.449 --> 07:01.432
He'll know
what that means.

07:01.466 --> 07:02.700
No one's helping me.

07:02.734 --> 07:04.502
Maybe you just weren't
giving me enough credit

07:04.536 --> 07:07.404
when you said
this was beneath you.

07:07.439 --> 07:09.507
Surprise.

07:09.541 --> 07:11.625
That's what the Donaghy method
is all about.

07:11.676 --> 07:13.744
Use my techniques
and I don't care

07:13.779 --> 07:16.597
who you're negotiating
against.

07:16.631 --> 07:17.615
You'll win.

07:17.649 --> 07:19.082
I'm negotiating against you,

07:19.100 --> 07:21.185
you magnificent bastard.

07:21.219 --> 07:23.520
You.

07:26.297 --> 07:28.397
Charlotte Bob is in trouble.

07:29.155 --> 07:32.724
This is the part of the movie
where I fell asleep.

07:32.742 --> 07:35.427
Jazz is gonna get you
out of this.

07:35.461 --> 07:38.530
Say, hey!
I am one slick brother.

07:38.564 --> 07:39.531
This blows.

07:39.565 --> 07:43.035
Be the robots
from <i>NFL on FOX.</i>

07:43.069 --> 07:45.404
Boo!

07:47.757 --> 07:48.907
You suck.

07:51.145 --> 07:52.228
Here's your tea,
Ms. Orman.

07:52.262 --> 07:54.230
- There you are.
- Who are you?

07:54.264 --> 07:55.498
What happened to Hazel?

07:55.532 --> 07:56.649
I'm sorry,
Ms. Orman.

07:56.700 --> 07:58.451
Hazel and I switched places.

07:58.485 --> 08:00.770
She's over at "TGS" now,
but don't worry.

08:00.804 --> 08:01.904
It's temporary.

08:01.939 --> 08:03.656
I just want all
the actors and writers there

08:03.707 --> 08:04.907
to realize
how much they miss me.

08:04.941 --> 08:06.642
And why should
they miss you?

08:06.677 --> 08:08.144
Well, I'd like
to think on some level,

08:08.178 --> 08:09.629
we're all friends.

08:09.663 --> 08:11.314
Do you socialize together
outside of work?

08:11.348 --> 08:12.748
Do you exchange gifts?

08:12.783 --> 08:15.685
Do you vacation together
on nonjudgmental cruise lines?

08:15.719 --> 08:17.053
Well, no, but...

08:17.087 --> 08:18.321
Listen, girlfriend.

08:18.355 --> 08:20.556
You're trying
to solve an emotional problem,

08:20.591 --> 08:23.426
but what you have
is a money problem.

08:23.460 --> 08:26.329
You want to be "friends"
with people like

08:26.363 --> 08:28.030
Tracy Jordan
and Jenna Maroney?

08:28.065 --> 08:30.600
They're rich,
so show me the money.

08:30.634 --> 08:31.601
How much do you make?

08:31.635 --> 08:32.602
I'm not sure.

08:32.635 --> 08:34.437
My church requires
a 110% tithe.

08:34.471 --> 08:36.155
- How old are you?
- Don't worry about it.

08:36.190 --> 08:37.523
How much have you saved?

08:37.573 --> 08:39.008
Are you talking about
saving squirrels from hawks?

08:39.042 --> 08:40.009
Zero.

08:40.043 --> 08:41.277
If you really
want to be friends

08:41.311 --> 08:42.528
with people this,

08:42.578 --> 08:44.647
you are going to have
to quit the page program,

08:44.681 --> 08:47.166
and get a real job so that you
can earn for your future.

08:47.201 --> 08:48.284
What?

08:48.318 --> 08:51.521
No, I can't quit
the page program.

08:51.555 --> 08:54.991
Well then, denied!

08:55.025 --> 08:56.893
You got the initiative.
How do you keep it?

08:56.927 --> 09:00.179
By making
a second first impression.

09:00.214 --> 09:01.631
You're going
to wear dark colors,

09:01.665 --> 09:03.399
with a single power accent.

09:03.433 --> 09:04.400
Every hair in place.

09:04.434 --> 09:06.669
Hair movement...

09:06.703 --> 09:07.870
Is a sign of weakness.

09:07.905 --> 09:09.906
And whatever you do,

09:09.940 --> 09:11.407
don't speak first.

09:11.441 --> 09:16.145
90% of negotiations are lost
by the person who speaks first.

09:16.180 --> 09:18.748
Because what is speaking
a sign of?

09:21.518 --> 09:22.485
Weakness?

09:22.519 --> 09:23.486
You, out.
Fired.

09:35.899 --> 09:37.199
I hate those shoes.

09:37.217 --> 09:39.752
Are we starting?
Please.

09:39.803 --> 09:41.070
All right.
Let's start with salary.

09:42.973 --> 09:44.090
What are you doing?

09:44.141 --> 09:45.975
I'm sorry.

09:46.009 --> 09:47.593
Are you on
some subconscious level

09:47.644 --> 09:49.512
seeing this as me
toying with your manhood?

09:49.546 --> 09:50.546
Of course I am.

09:50.564 --> 09:52.114
I invented that.

09:52.149 --> 09:53.900
<i>Boca 2002...</i>

09:53.934 --> 09:55.067
You've seen the tapes?

09:55.102 --> 09:56.519
What? No.
I-I just...

09:56.553 --> 09:58.554
You are
being coached by me.

09:58.572 --> 10:00.222
I'm sorry, Jack.
I have to take this.

10:00.240 --> 10:02.892
Yes, may I please speak
to pizza?

10:02.926 --> 10:04.860
The fake phone call
to buy time in an emergency?

10:04.895 --> 10:06.779
Classic Donaghy.

10:06.830 --> 10:08.598
Okay, fine.
You got me.

10:08.632 --> 10:09.599
Game over.

10:09.633 --> 10:10.583
No, no.

10:10.617 --> 10:12.101
This just levels
the playing field.

10:12.135 --> 10:13.769
Going mano a mano

10:13.804 --> 10:16.072
against a real adversary,
me...

10:16.106 --> 10:18.574
It's the ultimate game.

10:18.609 --> 10:23.379
Jack Donaghy...
Playing with himself.

10:23.413 --> 10:24.647
It's a Jack-off.

10:24.681 --> 10:26.299
Well, great job.

10:26.350 --> 10:28.134
Adam locked himself
in the bathroom.

10:28.185 --> 10:29.986
If we can get him
out of there,

10:30.020 --> 10:31.387
you two have
got to do better

10:31.421 --> 10:33.422
than that pathetic butchering
of <i>Who's on first?.</i>

10:33.457 --> 10:34.757
"Who's on first"!

10:34.775 --> 10:37.393
That's the phrase
I couldn't remember.

10:40.197 --> 10:41.897
What's going on here?

10:41.932 --> 10:44.467
I think we're waiting.

10:44.501 --> 10:45.468
I'm confused.

10:45.502 --> 10:47.336
We make other people wait.

10:47.371 --> 10:50.206
Forcing people to wait,
throwing things,

10:50.240 --> 10:52.942
making crazy demands
and never being satisfied...

10:52.976 --> 10:54.977
Adam's acting like us.

10:55.012 --> 10:56.612
But he's not famous.

10:56.647 --> 10:58.180
Why is the government
allowing this?

10:58.215 --> 11:00.166
Because today,
he's the star.

11:00.217 --> 11:01.584
A Jewish star.

11:01.618 --> 11:03.285
If we don't make
Adam happy,

11:03.303 --> 11:04.920
his dad is going
to tell the IRS

11:04.954 --> 11:06.172
my house isn't a church,

11:06.223 --> 11:09.141
although I do let children
drink wine there.

11:09.176 --> 11:10.893
Tracy,
as fellow stars,

11:10.927 --> 11:13.863
we may actually be able
to solve Adam's problem.

11:13.897 --> 11:15.131
I mean,
when we're acting out,

11:15.165 --> 11:16.232
what makes us happy?

11:16.266 --> 11:17.300
When I'm acting out,

11:17.334 --> 11:18.868
it's never
about the real problem.

11:18.902 --> 11:19.969
Like all actors,

11:20.003 --> 11:21.637
I'm not emotionally
mature enough

11:21.672 --> 11:23.306
to deal with my feelings,
you fart-face.

11:23.340 --> 11:24.440
I know you are,
but what am I?

11:24.474 --> 11:26.692
Adam isn't upset
about us.

11:26.743 --> 11:27.710
It's something else.

11:27.744 --> 11:29.245
We just have
to find out

11:29.279 --> 11:31.831
what it is
and save this Bar Mitzvah.

11:31.865 --> 11:35.117
So you've lost the initiative,
perhaps by being a woman

11:35.151 --> 11:36.118
or a shorter man,

11:36.152 --> 11:37.670
but you can regain it

11:37.704 --> 11:39.889
by fighting
on your home turf.

11:39.923 --> 11:42.925
No one has ever
won a land war in Russia.

11:42.959 --> 11:44.360
Not Napoleon,
not Hitler,

11:44.394 --> 11:46.962
not even Balki
in the unaired ninth season

11:46.997 --> 11:48.230
of <i>Perfect strangers.</i>

11:48.265 --> 11:49.765
So where's your Russia?

11:49.800 --> 11:51.734
What's your home turf?

11:51.768 --> 11:55.171
The one place in the world
where you cannot lose.

11:55.205 --> 11:57.039
Ice cream store.

12:02.957 --> 12:03.940
What are you doing?

12:03.958 --> 12:05.375
This is the men's room,
Jenna.

12:05.409 --> 12:07.177
Not the C-list skank's room.

12:07.211 --> 12:09.446
That's solid,
but that's not why we're here.

12:09.480 --> 12:11.448
Adam, we want to help.

12:11.482 --> 12:12.949
You're the star today.

12:12.967 --> 12:15.185
And we know
how hard that can be.

12:15.219 --> 12:17.787
Look, we know you're not
really mad about us.

12:17.805 --> 12:19.756
You acting out
is about something else.

12:19.790 --> 12:20.957
You can tell us.

12:20.991 --> 12:22.475
We're in S.A.G.

12:23.594 --> 12:24.311
It's just...

12:24.312 --> 12:27.180
Everyone expects me to
dance with a girl today.

12:27.231 --> 12:29.149
And I don't know
about girls.

12:29.183 --> 12:31.134
I mean, I've played
this Japanese video game

12:31.152 --> 12:32.819
where you slap prostitutes
to death,

12:32.853 --> 12:34.821
but you only ever dance
with this penguin

12:34.855 --> 12:35.872
named Yamagiku.

12:35.906 --> 12:37.507
Adam, trust me.

12:37.541 --> 12:39.409
Any girl would want
to dance with you.

12:39.443 --> 12:40.610
You're rich.

12:40.644 --> 12:43.363
And you're fat, so you'll die young.
Women love that.

12:43.414 --> 12:44.981
Ad-rock,
I'm going to tell you

12:44.999 --> 12:47.484
the same thing
I tell my son.

12:47.518 --> 12:49.252
Put money
in the girl's mouth.

12:49.286 --> 12:52.055
Also, my friend, Darryl,
is your real father.

12:52.089 --> 12:55.708
Now you go get 'em.

13:00.131 --> 13:01.798
Hazel,
why does my coffee order

13:01.832 --> 13:03.166
say "the black one"
on it?

13:04.685 --> 13:06.169
Did you put peanuts
on this?

13:06.203 --> 13:07.503
Yeah,
it's delicious, hat guy.

13:07.521 --> 13:08.688
I'm allergic!

13:08.722 --> 13:09.806
Damn it!

13:09.840 --> 13:13.643
I have to write a 40-word
exit evaluation of Kenneth!

13:13.677 --> 13:15.344
I wish I was dead!

13:23.537 --> 13:25.021
Okay, Kenneth.
You win.

13:25.055 --> 13:26.372
Please come back.

13:26.407 --> 13:28.324
Okay.
When is my birthday?

13:28.359 --> 13:29.859
I don't know.

13:29.894 --> 13:31.828
When is that party you throw
that we never go to

13:31.862 --> 13:34.914
'cause we don't know what to get
the man who has nothing.

13:34.965 --> 13:36.699
Suze Orman was right.

13:36.717 --> 13:41.471
I need to quit the page program
and get a real job.

13:47.595 --> 13:50.079
You know what
we did today?

13:50.114 --> 13:52.015
An amazing rendition
of "What's the guy's name

13:52.049 --> 13:53.349
who plays first base?"

13:53.383 --> 13:55.351
No, we solved a problem

13:55.385 --> 13:56.820
by just addressing it,
head on.

13:56.854 --> 13:58.254
Tracy,

13:58.289 --> 14:01.574
what if you and I dealt with
all of our problems that way?

14:01.609 --> 14:04.060
What if we were honest at work
about what's bothering us?

14:04.094 --> 14:07.096
That would make everyone's
lives a whole lot better.

14:07.131 --> 14:08.731
Like the polio vaccine.

14:08.749 --> 14:11.201
Or a no-bottom strip club
near a Wendy's.

14:11.235 --> 14:14.704
Let's do it, J-Mo.

14:14.738 --> 14:15.872
Hey, Jack.

14:15.906 --> 14:16.873
Sorry I'm so late.

14:16.907 --> 14:17.874
You're not.

14:17.908 --> 14:18.908
I changed
the clock on your phone.

14:18.943 --> 14:20.960
I just got here.

14:22.246 --> 14:23.913
Anyway,
I really appreciate

14:23.931 --> 14:25.581
you coming
to my neighborhood,

14:25.599 --> 14:28.935
my home turf,
if you will.

14:31.689 --> 14:32.655
I see.

14:32.690 --> 14:35.808
Well played, Jack.

14:41.298 --> 14:43.483
You anticipated
my counter move,

14:43.534 --> 14:45.602
employing
"A shortness is weakness"

14:45.636 --> 14:46.603
power axiom.

14:46.637 --> 14:48.454
However,
I knew that you might know

14:48.489 --> 14:50.106
that I knew
to bring my own furniture,

14:50.140 --> 14:54.277
so I also brought
my Jack Welch power pillow.

14:54.311 --> 14:56.829
I'm very sorry, sir.

14:56.881 --> 14:58.414
I thought
you might do that,

14:58.448 --> 15:00.116
which is why I'm going
to be the first person

15:00.150 --> 15:01.834
to do power quiet talking,

15:01.886 --> 15:04.520
forcing you to lean in
and wonder if you're missing

15:04.555 --> 15:05.588
any key phrases.

15:05.622 --> 15:07.090
Like an idiot.

15:07.124 --> 15:08.958
I thought you'd try
power quiet talking,

15:08.993 --> 15:11.661
which is why
I'm wearing a hearing aid.

15:11.695 --> 15:12.962
Stalemate.

15:12.980 --> 15:14.364
I'm everything
I hoped I'd be.

15:14.398 --> 15:15.848
Let's begin.

15:15.900 --> 15:17.033
2% raise,

15:17.067 --> 15:19.168
a show on Christmas,
no gross merchandising,

15:19.203 --> 15:20.436
and you have a run
in your stocking.

15:20.471 --> 15:22.338
8% raise,
two weeks off at Christmas,

15:22.373 --> 15:23.940
5% gross, and nice try.

15:23.974 --> 15:25.141
I'm not wearing stockings.

15:25.175 --> 15:26.142
That's a vein.

15:26.176 --> 15:27.377
No raise,
no vacation,

15:27.411 --> 15:28.945
and from now on,
you have to say,

15:28.979 --> 15:30.513
"go for Liz,"
when you answer your phone.

15:30.547 --> 15:32.148
Um, hold on a sec.

15:32.182 --> 15:33.449
Come on, Lemon.

15:33.484 --> 15:34.484
I'm just doing
the sorcerer's apprentice.

15:34.518 --> 15:35.952
You respond with
a pirate holiday,

15:35.986 --> 15:38.454
and I have no choice but
to play the hillbilly auction.

15:38.489 --> 15:40.456
It's all on the tapes.

15:40.490 --> 15:41.491
Forget it.
This is taking too long.

15:41.525 --> 15:42.959
I'll do both sides.

15:42.993 --> 15:44.060
If you think I won't

15:44.094 --> 15:45.461
do the show without Lemon,
think again.

15:45.496 --> 15:46.662
Jack, you're bluffing.

15:46.680 --> 15:47.997
Liz, we're out of here.

15:48.015 --> 15:49.999
If you walk out that door,

15:50.017 --> 15:51.534
you'll burn every bridge
she has here.

15:51.568 --> 15:52.835
It'll be back
to submitting

15:52.853 --> 15:55.738
topical menopause jokes
to joy behar by fax.

15:55.773 --> 15:56.739
Please.

15:56.774 --> 15:58.141
You'd be in breach.

15:58.175 --> 15:59.559
You'd have more lawyers on you
than a midtown hooker.

15:59.610 --> 16:00.860
You're all talk.

16:00.894 --> 16:01.861
It's like that time
you said you'd hit on

16:01.895 --> 16:03.546
Carla Bruni
in front of Sarkozy,

16:03.580 --> 16:04.847
and you totally backed down.

16:04.882 --> 16:05.949
So did you.

16:05.983 --> 16:07.233
Sorry, I have to take this.

16:07.284 --> 16:08.418
Hello?

16:08.452 --> 16:11.404
It's me. Nice try.

16:11.455 --> 16:14.157
I'm writing down a number.

16:17.211 --> 16:18.878
You're dreaming.

16:18.912 --> 16:21.381
Then I'd counter.
I'd reject that.

16:21.415 --> 16:24.867
Then an elegante,
parry with an elegante primo,

16:24.902 --> 16:28.838
5%, I demand three years...

16:28.872 --> 16:30.089
No, that can't be right.

16:30.140 --> 16:33.910
Elegante, elegante primo,
carry the one...

16:35.212 --> 16:37.046
Good God.

16:37.081 --> 16:38.581
- What?
- You won.

16:38.615 --> 16:39.582
I did?

16:39.616 --> 16:40.917
You got everything
you wanted.

16:40.951 --> 16:42.352
Kabletown Jack
made a mistake,

16:42.386 --> 16:45.621
and Lemon Jack
pounced on it.

16:45.656 --> 16:46.856
I-me lost.

16:46.890 --> 16:47.907
Yes!
I won!

16:47.941 --> 16:49.359
Nobody beats the Liz!

16:50.494 --> 16:51.444
Sorry.

16:51.495 --> 16:53.229
In your face.

16:53.247 --> 16:54.897
Mr. Hornberger.

16:54.915 --> 16:57.784
I got the message about
the good-bye Kenneth brunch.

16:57.835 --> 16:59.068
I can't tell you
how touched...

16:59.103 --> 17:01.204
Yeah, that was a lie.
But look who's here?

17:01.238 --> 17:02.772
- Double actor announcement.
- Double actor announcement.

17:02.806 --> 17:04.406
Over the years,

17:04.425 --> 17:06.575
we've wasted a lot of time
complaining about things

17:06.593 --> 17:08.444
other than
what's really bothering us.

17:08.479 --> 17:10.279
From now on,
Tracy and I

17:10.314 --> 17:12.265
are going
to be more "haw-naist."

17:12.299 --> 17:14.584
Instead of
just throwing tantrums,

17:14.617 --> 17:16.019
we're going
to talk things through.

17:16.053 --> 17:17.220
Who's that lady?

17:17.253 --> 17:19.255
It's her fault
that it's cold in here!

17:19.289 --> 17:20.256
Tracy...

17:20.273 --> 17:21.523
Be honest.

17:21.558 --> 17:23.592
It's not about
the air-conditioning, is it?

17:23.609 --> 17:25.928
Okay.

17:25.963 --> 17:27.396
It's just
that I see a new page,

17:27.431 --> 17:28.731
and I'm not used
to change.

17:28.765 --> 17:32.318
Because I was raised
in foster care.

17:35.155 --> 17:37.323
Sounds like
Tracy's missing someone.

17:37.374 --> 17:39.475
He's missing me.

17:39.510 --> 17:42.278
Boy, you are dumb sometimes.

17:42.296 --> 17:46.466
Tracy,
this new page is Hazel,

17:46.500 --> 17:47.616
Kenneth's replacement.

17:47.634 --> 17:50.153
Kenneth wants
to leave the page program

17:50.187 --> 17:52.004
so he can go
make more money.

17:52.056 --> 17:55.091
But you need him here,
don't you?

17:55.125 --> 17:58.594
Yes, I do need you, Kenneth.
I depend on you.

17:58.629 --> 18:00.129
But I'm telling you
to go,

18:00.164 --> 18:02.131
because now
that I'm being honest,

18:02.166 --> 18:04.100
this job
is a dead end for you.

18:04.134 --> 18:07.637
And it would be selfish
of me to make you stay.

18:07.671 --> 18:09.305
Are you serious?

18:09.339 --> 18:11.274
Yes.
Now go.

18:11.308 --> 18:13.993
Run, Kenneth.

18:14.027 --> 18:17.530
Run before I change my mind.

18:20.918 --> 18:22.034
Run, Kenneth!

18:22.086 --> 18:24.670
Run!

18:24.705 --> 18:28.174
Hey, your video says
that after a negotiation,

18:28.208 --> 18:31.194
the winner should get
the loser a gift.

18:31.228 --> 18:32.712
So I brought you
this popcorn tin.

18:32.763 --> 18:33.830
There's no popcorn left,

18:33.864 --> 18:36.516
but it makes
a great closet organizer.

18:36.550 --> 18:38.518
Socks, underwear,
bras.

18:38.552 --> 18:39.835
I used to be a winner.

18:39.853 --> 18:42.738
Men wanted to be me,
women wanted to sleep with me,

18:42.773 --> 18:46.008
bisexuals wanted to watch.

18:46.043 --> 18:47.276
Now look at me.

18:47.311 --> 18:50.046
A meaningless job,
I can't get my wife back.

18:50.080 --> 18:52.615
What's the point?

18:52.649 --> 18:55.485
Maybe I'll just quit
and...

18:55.519 --> 18:56.986
Go work
for a not-for-profit.

18:57.020 --> 18:58.955
Somewhere where
there's less pressure

18:58.989 --> 19:00.556
and the people are nice.

19:00.591 --> 19:03.092
And I can wear sneakers
and jeans on Friday.

19:03.127 --> 19:04.093
No, Jack, stop.

19:04.128 --> 19:05.361
It's okay.

19:05.379 --> 19:07.547
I hate myself.

19:07.581 --> 19:10.967
I want to be somebody else!
I want to be a baby again!

19:12.436 --> 19:13.920
No, no, no.
Look, you won.

19:13.971 --> 19:15.037
I'll sign whatever.

19:15.072 --> 19:17.640
Just don't cry.
Daddy doesn't cry.

19:17.674 --> 19:19.842
I don't need
gross merchandising.

19:22.346 --> 19:23.563
Excellent.

19:23.597 --> 19:25.281
What?
What are you doing?

19:25.315 --> 19:26.916
- Proving I could win.
- God!

19:26.950 --> 19:27.900
You were freaking me out.

19:27.935 --> 19:29.018
Exactly.

19:29.052 --> 19:31.220
Do you know
why I lost earlier?

19:31.255 --> 19:32.889
Because of our friendship.

19:32.923 --> 19:34.457
I want you
to have everything.

19:34.491 --> 19:36.159
And that made me
make a mistake.

19:36.193 --> 19:38.628
In other words,
I lost because of emotion,

19:38.662 --> 19:40.897
which I always thought
was a weakness,

19:40.931 --> 19:42.732
but now I've learned
it can also be a weapon.

19:42.766 --> 19:44.617
You didn't realize
emotion could be a weapon?

19:44.668 --> 19:46.619
Have you not read
the poetry of jewel?

19:46.670 --> 19:47.920
The point is,

19:47.955 --> 19:50.756
you had Liz's Jack
on your side.

19:50.791 --> 19:55.478
And that's why
he-me beat Kabletown Jack,

19:55.512 --> 19:59.048
until me-I turned
the tables on you-you.

19:59.082 --> 20:03.653
So that means that
my me-I taught your you-you

20:03.687 --> 20:04.954
a negotiation trick.

20:04.988 --> 20:08.157
Yes,
I suppose you did.

20:08.192 --> 20:09.192
Wow.

20:09.226 --> 20:11.060
After six years,
there's still room

20:11.094 --> 20:13.462
for growth
in this friendship.

20:13.497 --> 20:14.447
What... why are you
signing that?

20:14.481 --> 20:15.481
You won?

20:15.532 --> 20:16.949
Lemon,
I wanted to know I could win.

20:16.984 --> 20:18.301
I'm still going
to take care of you.

20:19.670 --> 20:22.205
Excuse me, sirs.

20:22.239 --> 20:23.322
Mr. Donaghy,

20:23.373 --> 20:24.840
do you remember
the other day when you said

20:24.875 --> 20:27.610
there are other opportunities
for me at the company?

20:27.644 --> 20:29.078
Of course.

20:29.112 --> 20:30.780
Well, I would like
to discuss those opportunities

20:30.814 --> 20:31.914
with you further.

20:31.949 --> 20:34.750
Because I am quitting
the page program.

20:34.784 --> 20:36.352
But you have
no other skills.

20:36.386 --> 20:38.754
He's a white male
with hair, Lemon.

20:38.789 --> 20:42.508
The sky's the limit.

20:44.961 --> 20:46.495
To white men!

20:50.675 --> 20:52.642
Adam, we hear you're a Yankees fan.

20:52.790 --> 20:54.524
Tracy, aren't you
a coach for the Yankees?

20:54.558 --> 20:55.942
You must know
all the players.

20:55.976 --> 20:57.026
Sure.

20:57.061 --> 20:58.745
Those players
have some crazy names.

20:58.779 --> 21:00.113
Like Derek and Alex.

21:00.164 --> 21:01.247
Who's on first?

21:01.281 --> 21:02.498
We're going to get confused.

21:02.533 --> 21:04.233
The guy who plays first
is who?

21:04.251 --> 21:05.234
No, thank you.

21:05.269 --> 21:06.469
I mean the fellow's name.

21:06.503 --> 21:08.705
- Everybody.
- The guy on first.

21:08.739 --> 21:10.289
His wife's name is <i> don't.</i>

21:10.340 --> 21:12.041
What's the guy's name
on first base?

21:12.075 --> 21:13.176
Know what
died in Vietnam.

21:13.210 --> 21:15.311
I'm not asking you
who's on second.

21:15.345 --> 21:16.746
Let's just agree
to disagree.

21:16.780 --> 21:18.347
- Fourth base!
- Fourth base!
