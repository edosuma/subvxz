MAN: This activity must be what
threw the satellite out of orbit.

01:04:56.142 --> 01:05:00.547
MEDDOWS: Correct. Our little experimental
virus seems to have grown up...

01:05:00.647 --> 01:05:04.509
into a plasmic life-form
that hunts its prey.

01:05:04.609 --> 01:05:07.721
A predator. It's fantastic.

01:05:07.821 --> 01:05:10.682
Sir, the organism is growing
at a geometric rate.

01:05:10.782 --> 01:05:14.311
By all accounts, it's at least a
thousand times its original mass.

01:05:14.411 --> 01:05:18.231
This'll put U.S. Defense
years ahead of the Russians.

01:05:18.331 --> 01:05:22.569
You don't understand. At this rate,
by next week there may be no U.S.

01:05:22.669 --> 01:05:23.737
MEDDOWS: Nonsense.

01:05:23.837 --> 01:05:26.072
All we have to do is
contain it properly.

01:05:26.172 --> 01:05:29.743
As far as the locals are concerned,
this is simply a medical quarantine.

01:05:29.843 --> 01:05:33.113

agree with any of this.

01:05:50.196 --> 01:05:53.683
This isn't one of your textbook
exercises, Mr. Jennings.

01:05:53.783 --> 01:05:58.563
This is an experiment in biological
warfare. Or hadn't you noticed?

01:05:58.663 --> 01:06:01.858
That organism is potentially the greatest
breakthrough in weapons research...

01:06:01.958 --> 01:06:03.943
since man split the atom.

01:06:04.043 --> 01:06:08.448
What we do here will affect
the balance of world power.

01:06:08.548 --> 01:06:11.576
Of course there are lives at stake...
whole nations, in fact.

01:06:11.676 --> 01:06:15.230
And that's far more important than a
handful of people in this small town.

01:06:16.389 --> 01:06:18.917

- Colonel, we've got an eyewitness

01:06:34.733 --> 01:06:37.310

some civilians into the sewers.

01:06:37.410 --> 01:06:40.563
It's got Kevin and Eddie and Meg
down there! You gotta do something!

01:06:40.663 --> 01:06:43.775
Excellent! We need a schematic
of the sewer system.

01:06:43.875 --> 01:06:47.070
We'll contain it down there.
I want that organism alive.
