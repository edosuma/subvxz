<i>It's amazing how much kids
stick out to their parents.</i>

00:03.979 --> 00:06.502
You know when I daydream
and go like this.

00:06.997 --> 00:09.634
- Dude you totally go like that.
- And checks him out.

00:10.522 --> 00:11.697
<i>I wonder what he's thinking.</i>

00:13.465 --> 00:16.245
Guys, Sam is hungry.
Can anybody help me out?

00:16.847 --> 00:19.780
Sure, sure. Pass him over
here, I'm boundary to burst.

00:20.301 --> 00:23.145
Thanks. I'd do it myself
but I'm all tapped out.

00:23.414 --> 00:25.692
Turk and I had a milk
fight in the parking lot.

00:26.355 --> 00:27.136
I lost.

00:27.378 --> 00:30.311
Ok, Chip, latch on,
it's right there. Latch.

00:30.832 --> 00:32.625
Letch. He's latch, he's latch.

00:32.662 --> 00:36.107
- Oh! Dude we said truce!
- Count it.

00:38.107 --> 00:41.758
- I'm off. You wanna to go shoo some hoops?
- I have a baby strapped to my chest.

00:42.162 --> 00:44.441
- So I just won't pass to you.
- Cool, same as always.

00:44.593 --> 00:46.899
Or you could spend some
quality time with your daughter.

00:47.231 --> 00:50.918
It seems like you're giving me a
choice but you're really not, are you?

00:51.052 --> 00:53.973
Nope. She's not. And the
only way to get freewill back

00:53.974 --> 00:57.769
is to stop caring of you ever
get to hit that again. Am I right?

00:57.996 --> 00:58.750
Pretty much.

00:59.754 --> 01:03.423
Hey Bob! Some of the other board members
were saying tomorrow is your birthday.

01:03.908 --> 01:05.039
So how old does that make you?

01:05.083 --> 01:09.524
Well, it depends. Are we talking dog
years or horny gold bastard years?

01:11.174 --> 01:12.726
I'll be fifty-eight.

01:13.119 --> 01:16.952
I didn't know it was your birthday tomorrow!
You're are definitely getting a cake.

01:17.051 --> 01:18.957
I'll play what do you
want. Chocolate or vanilla?

01:18.958 --> 01:21.002
Wait, don't answer.
I'm gonna surprise you.

01:21.851 --> 01:25.035
- It's gonna be chocolate. I like chocolate.
- Uuuh! Fun!

01:25.063 --> 01:28.498
Could you also have the right mind
your own damn business and I sing

01:28.499 --> 01:31.935
and then jam your face into it
so the message really sings in?

01:36.097 --> 01:38.950
How is your vacation going in
your firebreathing mother's house?

01:39.461 --> 01:43.802
Yeah, yeah, my mum's a dragon and I'm
her hellspawn, we eat children whatever.

01:44.313 --> 01:47.057
Listen Per, Jack misses you and he won't
go to sleep unless you say goodnight

01:47.058 --> 01:48.484
in that silly voice he loves.

01:48.547 --> 01:52.324
Jackie, you're getting all too old for
that now, pal. You're... You're four!

01:52.870 --> 01:55.876
I mean, people are actually even starting to
understand about the third of what you say.

01:56.254 --> 02:00.605
<i>I like like my mama when
bites a coast of pizza.</i>

02:01.643 --> 02:05.755
Fantastic. Anyway, so no more
silly voices. Ok there, Jumbo?

02:08.204 --> 02:09.280
Solid parenting.

02:10.050 --> 02:10.902
Glad I could help.

02:11.998 --> 02:16.042
- Damn, Izzie! You're looking good, girl!
- Thank you Sam!

02:16.043 --> 02:21.023
You not only have a sour spot in your
heart, but you have one in your head!

02:21.363 --> 02:23.753
What do you say we hit
up a Wiggles concert,

02:23.754 --> 02:27.925
then go back to my crib and pop up
on some formulas, see what happens?

02:28.290 --> 02:33.995
Come in taste this brown
sugar. Taste this brown sugar!

02:34.193 --> 02:37.431
Turk, we can't make them kiss until
Sam can hold his head up for real.

02:37.916 --> 02:39.091
I missed this man.

02:39.414 --> 02:41.495
If I'm not at work I'm
taking care of Izzie.

02:41.672 --> 02:44.688
I feel like I don't get to roll
with you. I just do goofy stuff.

02:45.102 --> 02:47.434
It's just that when I have
Sam I'm so busy, you know.

02:47.829 --> 02:53.229
We're up at six, I feed him, I bath him, and
it's poopy time, then it's his poopy time.

02:53.283 --> 02:55.491
But that's why we need to get
this two together right away.

02:55.492 --> 02:57.804
They need to get married
so we can hang all the time.

02:58.009 --> 03:01.221
There's no guarantees, Turk. The
other day I had Sam in the hospital,

03:01.517 --> 03:04.684
and when Dr. Cox brought in his
daughter, he definitely turned his head.

03:05.823 --> 03:08.173
Ok, I turned it. But I
can tell he wanted me to.

03:08.604 --> 03:12.210
There's plenty of fish in the
sea girl! I don't need you!

03:12.551 --> 03:16.256
Like look at that! You are
hot, baby! What is going on

03:16.319 --> 03:20.194
over there? I want to hit
that, I want to spank it good.

03:20.230 --> 03:23.190
I like to spank it, I
want to get it to you.

03:23.782 --> 03:26.823
I'm sorry. Kids, huh? I'll talk to him.

What's the last time we did some stupid?

03:57.388 --> 04:00.045
Well... We told Rex we'd
cover his shifts next weekend

04:00.046 --> 04:03.701
if he agreed to follow Hooch everywhere
he went and never tell him why.

04:05.837 --> 04:08.474

Hell... He'll know
by the end of the day.

04:26.937 --> 04:30.274
Anyways... What's the last time we
did something off the hook stupid?

04:30.714 --> 04:32.885
Probably last is the second
day at college. Remember?

04:33.306 --> 04:36.554
When it wasn't just the two
of us. It was the three of us.

04:37.182 --> 04:39.075
All right you guys? I know
that we only met yesterday,

04:39.245 --> 04:41.802
but I have the feeling we
gonna be best buds forever.

04:42.002 --> 04:43.035
Hands in.

04:43.469 --> 04:44.698

If we pool this prank off we're gonna be
the coolest freshmen on the all campus.

04:53.652 --> 04:55.835
- Here we are.
- Let me do it.

What?

04:57.982 --> 04:59.375
<i>Ijo les!</i>

05:06.183 --> 05:08.399
Rest in peace, Caramel Bear.

05:09.036 --> 05:12.722
Dude, just because we never saw Ricky
on campus again, it doesn't mean is dead.

05:12.723 --> 05:14.902
His parents came and packed
up all his stuff, Turk.

05:15.199 --> 05:18.383
And his roomie got straight As that
semester, had not even gone to class.

05:18.384 --> 05:21.738
All righty, then. How are
we feeling today there, Josh?

05:22.331 --> 05:25.130
I'm ok. Little tired,
Doc. How about you?

05:25.759 --> 05:29.898
Well, I'm 47 and recently lost the
ability to break down dairy products,

05:29.931 --> 05:31.902
but otherwise I'm dandy.
Thank you for asking.

05:32.492 --> 05:37.421
Whoa! T.M.I.! Right Josh?
Too much informations, huh?

05:38.832 --> 05:42.692
Tell you what, I'm gonna let you hang out
with nurse "Early 90s catchphrases" here,

05:42.709 --> 05:45.420
while your parents come out in the
hallway and we'll have a little discussion.

05:45.445 --> 05:46.463
We will be back.

05:49.199 --> 05:53.081
Look, Josh's bloodwork shows that he's
anemic with a high white cell count,

05:53.205 --> 05:55.138
Now, we are not gonna
know anything for sure

05:55.139 --> 05:59.089
until his bone marrow biopsy comes back,
but I'm afraid it might be leukemia.

06:00.063 --> 06:01.260
Oh, my God!

06:01.627 --> 06:03.460
Well, hope for the best.

06:08.732 --> 06:09.700
Ok, listen up!

06:10.059 --> 06:11.919
I need a volontaire to clear
these schedules for tomorrow

06:11.920 --> 06:14.486
beacuse we're going to have a
little party for Kelso's birthday.

06:14.781 --> 06:16.919
Kelso makes my life hell.

06:17.221 --> 06:21.139
Now, I know I usually cave, but
there's no way I'm going to his party.

06:21.857 --> 06:22.837
I understand, Ted.

06:23.003 --> 06:25.153
Fine, I'll go. Dammit.

06:25.474 --> 06:28.266
So, I'm getting the cake. I just need
someone to pick up the decorations.

06:28.374 --> 06:31.122
Fine, I'll get them. What's happening?!

06:31.459 --> 06:33.562
Uh, and make sure you get 58 candles.

06:34.029 --> 06:37.380
58? He told me turn 58 last year.

06:37.610 --> 06:39.411
He told me he was 58 three year ago.

06:39.748 --> 06:42.303
Great. Can anyone help me
find out Kelso's real age?

06:42.963 --> 06:43.968
<i>You rang?</i>

06:45.145 --> 06:46.409
I know you didn't, I
just like saying that.

06:46.626 --> 06:48.293
Although, actually, I do hear bells.

06:48.790 --> 06:51.316
But now They're gone. Anyway, I'll help.

06:51.897 --> 06:54.439
- Cool, ok, because, I swear on God, she...
- Hold it! They're back.

06:57.528 --> 06:58.445
They're gone.

06:59.662 --> 07:01.334
No. Ping up. Go.

07:01.894 --> 07:03.393
- Ok, because I thought...
- Stop. Bells.

07:03.990 --> 07:06.164
Bells, bells... No bells.

07:06.841 --> 07:08.094
- Why don't we start with that...
- Stop.

07:08.984 --> 07:10.499
Go. Stop.

07:13.095 --> 07:15.693
Ok, we are both off in an
hour, so I planned a plan.

07:15.880 --> 07:18.069
You just said the same word
twice in the same sentence.

07:18.136 --> 07:19.319
You just did it too.

07:19.554 --> 07:22.095
That is so weird that I did
even notice that I did that.

07:22.096 --> 07:23.678
Same word four times, one sentence.

07:23.711 --> 07:26.178
- Dude, you're in the zone.
- I feel it. What we're doing, today?

07:26.408 --> 07:29.688
Ok. We gotta go old school.
Brace yourself from my arm,

07:30.198 --> 07:32.278
World's most giant Black Doctor.

07:32.617 --> 07:34.752
Turk, I thought we are agreed to
save him from black history month.

07:34.785 --> 07:36.435
Then where we wanna
scare racist patients.

07:36.497 --> 07:39.551
I know but that guy into a Ford asked me
about I want to finish his fried chicken.

07:39.581 --> 07:40.713
But you love fried chicken...

07:40.714 --> 07:43.997
And I ate that bad boy like it was my
last meal, but I wasn't happy about it.

07:44.523 --> 07:46.290
- Fine, I'm in.
- Good, because...

07:46.956 --> 07:47.856
I need this.

07:48.315 --> 07:51.560
Oh, my God! That's awesome!
Carla, look what Turk made.

07:51.694 --> 07:53.556
Awesome! Idiots.

07:54.030 --> 07:55.681
- We heard that!
- We heard that!

07:57.624 --> 07:59.508
Josh's biopsy results.

08:03.475 --> 08:08.481
Unfortunately, that's what I thought...
Your son has hairy cell leukemia.

08:10.429 --> 08:13.486
Now, the good news is
it's very, very treatable.

08:14.203 --> 08:18.208
If you'd like, I'll be more than glad to go
in there and explain this whole to Josh myself.

08:18.691 --> 08:22.054
We already decided that if Josh
didn't help having cancer....

08:24.738 --> 08:26.023
We were gonna tell him.

08:28.607 --> 08:29.727
What just happened?

08:31.693 --> 08:35.009
Do you wanna put your hands on the back of
your head, like you do when you're upset?

08:36.429 --> 08:37.313
I do a little.

08:46.994 --> 08:49.183
So, how do we find that Kelso's age?

08:50.281 --> 08:53.259
We pay a hundred people,
age one to a hundred,

08:53.417 --> 08:57.479
line'em all up and see
which one Kelso looks like.

08:59.201 --> 09:02.991
I say, we cut off Kelso's
legs, and we count the rings.

09:03.550 --> 09:05.815
- That only works on trees.
- And puppets.

09:06.752 --> 09:09.350
Ok, you guys have been super-helpful.

09:09.587 --> 09:11.323
I told you we would be!

09:11.481 --> 09:15.047
Still, I think I'm gonna go tackle this on my own
and let the 2 of you get back to hallucinating.

09:15.492 --> 09:19.360
Or... you could use these keys
to get into personnel files.

09:28.735 --> 09:30.048
That almost burned me.

09:31.103 --> 09:33.508
- You know what I would have done if it did?
- No.

09:35.796 --> 09:37.899
Burn for a burn, baby.

09:38.631 --> 09:39.894
That's in the Bible.

09:44.888 --> 09:47.336
Ow, Hooch is crazy!

09:48.606 --> 09:49.962
Aren't your arms getting tired?

09:51.886 --> 09:53.235
Oh, yeah.

09:53.989 --> 09:55.058
You believe those people?

09:55.496 --> 09:57.756
Thier kid has leukemia and
they're not even gonna tell him?

09:58.065 --> 10:00.958
- Well, they're his parents, it's their right.
- Oh, come on.

10:01.488 --> 10:03.813
Deserves to know what he's
up against, he can handle it.

10:03.814 --> 10:06.327
Hell, he's more mature than
most of the Yahoos in this dump.

10:06.599 --> 10:09.383
Check it out. World's
most giant clipboard, huh!

10:09.864 --> 10:11.392
Exhibit A, through Z.

10:11.464 --> 10:14.622
Oh, what's that, Per? I didn't quite hear
you, I wanna make sure I get it all down.

10:15.598 --> 10:16.861
Write this down, instead.

10:17.306 --> 10:19.344
I, John Dorian... write it down!

10:19.660 --> 10:21.267
I, John Dorian,

10:21.389 --> 10:25.078
am a ridiculous 32-year-old
overgrown infant. I mean, my God,

10:25.079 --> 10:28.292
2 weeks ago you were asking
everybody if you shouldn't grow up.

10:28.293 --> 10:30.202
Here I thought you were having
some big epiphany, that...

10:30.496 --> 10:33.381
you were gonna be more than
adult, now that you have a child.

10:33.711 --> 10:36.718
My bad. However, if I
forgot to congratulate you,

10:37.558 --> 10:39.410
let me do that now. Way to go.

10:39.891 --> 10:41.407
We are all super-proud of you.

10:49.029 --> 10:51.770
Turkleton, I hired you
as a surgeon, right?

10:52.014 --> 10:54.382
- Yep!
- Great job, Bob!

10:57.034 --> 11:00.913
- Hey! What's up, you're ready?
- Yeah, I don't think I'm up for it, man.

11:01.315 --> 11:03.174
- Why not?
- I don't know, Turk.

11:03.188 --> 11:06.848
Maybe 'cause I'm 32, and I'm
a doctor, and I have a kid.

11:07.093 --> 11:08.901
I mean, look at yourself, man.

11:09.655 --> 11:11.363
You look like an infant.

11:12.073 --> 11:13.537
It's probably time for us to grow up.

11:14.987 --> 11:18.108
<i>They say that the truth
hurts. And sometimes it does.</i>

11:19.767 --> 11:21.482
<i>But sometimes it's just surprising.</i>

11:21.669 --> 11:24.216
Robert Kelso, born 1942.

11:24.718 --> 11:26.685
Holy frick! Kelso's 65?!

11:28.113 --> 11:32.190
<i>And other times, the truth just wasn't
suppposed to be heard, in the first place.</i>

11:32.340 --> 11:33.804
- How d'you stay, pal?
- Hey.

11:34.249 --> 11:36.581
- Mind if I join you here?
- No, go ahead.

11:38.547 --> 11:39.430
Little Josh,

11:39.832 --> 11:42.910
I wanted to take a minute here, and
explaining what's wrong with you.

11:43.004 --> 11:43.729
Ok.

11:43.931 --> 11:45.694
Inside your body...

11:57.394 --> 11:59.252
<i>It was a moring of dramatic walkups.</i>

11:59.560 --> 12:01.957
<i>After one person dramatically
walks up to another,</i>

12:02.222 --> 12:04.375
<i>Like me to Turk, cause
I knew he was mad at me,</i>

12:04.519 --> 12:05.057
Hey.

12:05.717 --> 12:07.612
<i>or like Ted, to Dr. Cox,</i>

12:08.075 --> 12:11.560
The Winstons are *** that you
told their son about his leukemia.

12:11.767 --> 12:12.766
You did what?

12:12.881 --> 12:13.478
I made a...

12:13.479 --> 12:15.120
<i>Or Elliott, to Dr. Kelso.</i>

12:15.453 --> 12:16.349
I've got a secret.

12:17.296 --> 12:20.299
What has 2 thumbs, a funny voice,
and still doesn't give a crap?

12:20.300 --> 12:21.413
<i>Bob Kelso!</i>

12:21.539 --> 12:23.416
I added the funny
voice to keep it fresh.

12:23.686 --> 12:26.511
Well, I've got 65 reasons
why you should give a crap.

12:27.894 --> 12:29.880
You're old! Yes!

12:30.133 --> 12:32.228
I've been saying that everytime the
doors opened for the last 2 hours,

12:32.349 --> 12:33.480
and I finally got my man!

12:33.733 --> 12:36.299
Come on, give it up, le this up
him. Still got time! We'll do later!

12:37.522 --> 12:39.600
Turk, I know you're probably
mad at me about yesterday.

12:39.996 --> 12:42.281
- No, we're cool.
- See, I knew you get it.

12:42.418 --> 12:45.105
It's just time to leave our
childish ways behind, right?

12:45.467 --> 12:47.671
Hell to the NO! I'm
bringing you back, buddy!

12:48.325 --> 12:49.037
I'll see you later.

12:52.772 --> 12:53.950
Are you following me?

12:53.951 --> 12:56.019
- 'Cause I would cut you.
- I'll go around the corner.

13:02.339 --> 13:05.936
The Winstons aren't ready to
litigate yet, but they're still angry.

13:06.112 --> 13:08.115
You need to mitigate the situation

13:08.116 --> 13:09.872
because they have a really good lawyer.

13:09.890 --> 13:13.415
Honestly Ted, I'm just surprised you know
the difference between litigate and mitigate.

13:13.610 --> 13:16.530
Their lawyer Tommy, I'm telling
you, the guy's really good.

13:16.560 --> 13:19.174
- Wish you'd have my back on this one.
- I don't have your back on this.

13:19.167 --> 13:20.784
I just wanna ring
sightsees for when you get

13:20.785 --> 13:22.854
- your bony white ass handed to it.
- Not gonna happen.

13:23.693 --> 13:25.455
Doctor Cox, we wanna talk to you.

13:25.837 --> 13:27.459
We'll set to Josh first. Come on.

13:29.032 --> 13:32.798
I really don't wanna go in
a mitigation on this one.

13:33.889 --> 13:35.933
Wait? Yeah... that's right.

13:37.110 --> 13:40.055
you tell your parents what you said
to me when I told of the gentlekemia?

13:40.739 --> 13:43.919
I already know I was sick, because
mom was doing that weird smile.

13:44.826 --> 13:45.791
Yeah, that one.

13:47.188 --> 13:50.206
The only other time you had that look
was when you told me grandpa died.

13:50.716 --> 13:52.818
Sweety, I'm so sorry.

13:53.520 --> 13:54.896
I'll be right outside
here if you need me.

13:56.521 --> 13:58.030
Oh my goodness, what's....

13:59.338 --> 14:02.984
It's my bony white ass... And it's
till very much intact, isn't it?

14:03.288 --> 14:05.039
You just don't get it, do you?

14:06.572 --> 14:07.243
Get what?

14:08.546 --> 14:09.447
Chicks, ah?

14:09.941 --> 14:13.506
They're all soft and cuddly, but
you'll never get to be with one.

14:19.041 --> 14:20.585
Hey JD, I need a little help.

14:21.246 --> 14:22.577
Relax, this is work stuff.

14:23.156 --> 14:25.442
I have a patient who needs a
perioperate betablocker and---

14:25.443 --> 14:29.140
Now I was wondering if I needed to the
continue his IV drip or intimateing bulses.

14:29.575 --> 14:31.298
- Well, I'd probably start them off...
- Yeah, don't care.

14:31.510 --> 14:34.266
Check this out. Hooch is on
the verge of  a major meltdown.

14:34.456 --> 14:36.982
- Why? Is Rex still following him?
- Not just Rex.

14:37.407 --> 14:39.865
Three other interns
are following him too.

14:40.159 --> 14:41.535
They're all after this fellowship.

14:41.741 --> 14:44.331
I said whoever sticks to to him the
longest, I'll give recomandation.

14:49.905 --> 14:51.754
I'm about to use the toilet right now.

14:52.052 --> 14:55.216
So I hope you all are happy with
the order that you're standing in,

14:55.217 --> 14:59.544
Because if you follow me in there, that
is the order that I'm going to kill you.

15:00.755 --> 15:04.544
Oh yeah! Today is gonna
be a good day. Yes it is!

15:05.615 --> 15:07.922
- Come on, buddy!
- See you later.

15:12.533 --> 15:14.680
You read my private personnel files.

15:14.919 --> 15:16.212
You could read mine if you want.

15:16.700 --> 15:19.950
Of course, it says my name is Captain
Billy Stinkwater, and that I'm half gopher.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.853
Sir, I know that you're
sensitive about your age.

15:23.854 --> 15:27.119
But getting older comes with tons of
perks. I mean... you can mend more respect,

15:27.120 --> 15:29.866
- you get discounts...
- People think it's adorable when you two.

15:30.145 --> 15:33.239
Look, I do not care about getting older.

15:34.256 --> 15:35.375
- Woooooooo.
- See?

15:36.254 --> 15:38.682
- And what your problem?
- None of your business.

15:39.144 --> 15:41.949
Well, if you don't care then let us
throw your party, there's gonna be cake,

15:41.950 --> 15:44.004
- And presents, and...
- We have to get a present?

15:45.829 --> 15:48.430
- Mh... You can have any you want of my toolbelt.
- Sweet.

15:48.993 --> 15:52.869
I'll take that 12-volt cordless rechargeable
nickel-metal hydrate battery power drill.

15:53.247 --> 15:53.856
I was kidding.

15:54.109 --> 15:55.969
Too late. Hand it over.

15:57.083 --> 15:58.713
- Looks expensive.
- It is.

15:58.943 --> 15:59.557
Thank you.

16:00.338 --> 16:03.903
Doctor Reid, let me make
this as clear as possible.

16:04.724 --> 16:07.107
I do not want a party.

16:07.745 --> 16:09.943
Fair enough. There's just one problem.

16:11.046 --> 16:12.148
<i>Surprise!</i>

16:13.429 --> 16:15.243
Ted, these are Hanukkah decorations.

16:15.363 --> 16:16.954
They were on sale.

16:18.149 --> 16:19.584
Make a wish.

16:22.094 --> 16:26.325
- Awesome, thanks. 
- I'm glad you like it. I stole it from my husband.

16:28.282 --> 16:31.279
Hey Carla, I got you some
Kelso cake, it's delish...

16:31.560 --> 16:33.908
- And a dreidel.
- I'm not talking to you.

16:33.982 --> 16:37.077
Ok, now if was anybody else, I'd
just say "Thank you" and let it die.

16:37.127 --> 16:40.320
But, since it' s you, I gotta
know what it is that I don't get.

16:40.820 --> 16:43.604
- Too bad.
- Oh, come on!

16:44.667 --> 16:47.256
<i>Ok, walk by, so he doesn't
even have a chance to tempt you.</i>

16:47.932 --> 16:49.431
<i>What the hell is behind his ear?</i>

16:49.811 --> 16:51.016
I know you see that.

16:51.440 --> 16:54.988
- Why don't you just go ahead and grab it?
- Turk, I am not playing "hide the saltine".

16:55.756 --> 16:57.318
You know you wanna.

16:58.058 --> 17:01.382
- That's 1-nothing
me! - Yes it is!

17:01.617 --> 17:03.925
- Wait! Why are you torturing me?
- Wait! Why are you torturing me?

17:06.882 --> 17:10.717
- Happy birthday Dr. Kelso.
- Ooooh, thank you.

17:12.226 --> 17:13.575
Oh, my God, is that a smile?

17:14.185 --> 17:18.334
Well, it's like the last year, when the
safety brake failed on Enid's wheelchair,

17:18.335 --> 17:21.598
and she started rolling toward
our pool, I told myself: "Bob,

17:21.733 --> 17:25.694
it's already too late to stop it so you
might as well sit back and enjoy it."

17:26.722 --> 17:28.840
Sir, I got you a power drill,

17:28.841 --> 17:30.930
I know you wanted one
for your hobby shop.

17:30.931 --> 17:34.656
The Janitor already gave me
one, nobody likes a copycat.

17:35.379 --> 17:36.780
So what do I do with this?

17:37.469 --> 17:38.881
Ooh! Thanks.

17:39.341 --> 17:40.294
Heeeey!

17:41.448 --> 17:45.432
So Bob, I just dropped by to tell you we
need to find an intrern motorpathic surgeon.

17:46.213 --> 17:49.307
Probably Dr. Hooch was involved
in some kind of hostage situation.

17:49.703 --> 17:51.477
Well, Hooch is crazy.

17:52.729 --> 17:54.916
- 65, huh?
- Yeah...

17:55.920 --> 17:57.992
- How about that?
- How about that?

18:01.684 --> 18:03.626
Baby, have you been in my
locket? 'Cause i can't seem

18:03.627 --> 18:05.525
to find my autographed
Michael Jordan basketball.

18:05.703 --> 18:06.568
- Autographed?
- Yeah.

18:06.695 --> 18:07.259
- Nooo.

18:07.839 --> 18:09.222
- Ok, we gotta talk!
- Ok, we gotta talk!

18:09.768 --> 18:12.305
If you speak simultaneously
with me again,

18:12.463 --> 18:14.453
I'm going to have to kill you!

18:13.536 --> 18:14.441
<i>{a6}to kill you!</i>

18:14.694 --> 18:16.163
I'll tell you why I'm torturing you.

18:16.468 --> 18:17.782
Why would you stop being you?

18:17.977 --> 18:19.889
- Because he called me an infant!
- Of course he did.

18:19.975 --> 18:22.139
Plus, two weeks ago you were
all over me about growing up!

18:22.328 --> 18:24.504
But I wasn't saying you
needed to change who you are!

18:24.831 --> 18:26.369
I just meant that once
you have a kid you gotta be

18:26.370 --> 18:28.075
more responsible, and you're doing that.

18:28.540 --> 18:30.561
Look at you, you spend
a ton of time with Sam.

18:30.744 --> 18:32.547
Hell, you even started
a college fund for him.

18:32.926 --> 18:35.113
He started a college fund? We
didn't start a college fund.

18:35.285 --> 18:37.478
Baby, we're being in team.
How often does it happen?

18:37.593 --> 18:38.682
- Get in the game!
- Right.

18:38.719 --> 18:40.125
You're just as dumb as he is!

18:40.326 --> 18:43.111
Of course Josh had to find out
what was wrong with him, eventually,

18:43.145 --> 18:46.136
but you were so cavalier about telling
him and taking his childhood away!

18:46.256 --> 18:48.225
I didn't take his childhood away!

18:48.513 --> 18:51.779
Oh, really? Because Josh was
spending so much time on his laptop,

18:51.854 --> 18:56.228
researching leukemia mortality rates, I had
to give'im a basketball just to distract him!

18:56.331 --> 18:58.076
- Wait, what?!
- Turk, we're a team.

18:58.363 --> 19:01.174
Who cares about losing your
childhood, I damn sure didn't!

19:01.175 --> 19:03.421
Yeah, because your parents were
volountarily abusive of alcoholics.

19:03.926 --> 19:06.371
Not that there's anything wrong with
that, it was probably... very exciting.

19:06.658 --> 19:08.799
Don't take your lead from this
train wreck, if you're lucky enough

19:08.800 --> 19:11.349
to still have a kid inside,
you-you gotta hold on to that!

19:11.583 --> 19:14.161
And if you don't have one,
I bet if you think about it,

19:14.437 --> 19:17.933
you want your kids to spend as much
time as possible just being what?

19:18.619 --> 19:21.563
Yeah the only thing I hate
more than simultaneous speaking

19:21.564 --> 19:24.206
Is when people try to get
me to finish their sentences.

19:25.030 --> 19:26.741
Just being kids!

19:27.372 --> 19:28.165
That's right!

19:29.158 --> 19:31.787
By the way, baby, you're getting my
basketball back from that cancer kid.

19:36.092 --> 19:36.856
Oh, sorry.

19:37.671 --> 19:40.921
<i>No matter how old you are, you should
never foget the importance of childhood.</i>

19:41.240 --> 19:43.630
<i>Whether it's letting
your kid hold onto his...</i>

19:43.797 --> 19:46.007
How're you doing, Jackie?

19:46.621 --> 19:48.154
Yord again!

19:48.693 --> 19:50.990
- I love daddy!
- I love Jackie!

19:51.306 --> 19:53.264
Get me a kiss!

19:53.649 --> 19:54.723
<i>Or holding onto your own...</i>

19:54.866 --> 19:56.646
Excuse me, young miss.

19:56.933 --> 20:01.491
Would you like to sign this petition to
make our hospital more giant-accessible?

20:04.195 --> 20:05.608
How many signatures do we have?

20:05.682 --> 20:07.072
- None.
- Dammit.

20:07.795 --> 20:08.644
Excuse me sir,

20:09.133 --> 20:12.784
Excuse me sir, would you like to sign this
petition to make our hospital more giant-accessible?

20:13.515 --> 20:15.350
<i>Because everithing happens so fast,</i>

20:16.326 --> 20:18.037
<i>it can all slip away before you know.</i>

20:18.691 --> 20:22.922
Uh, Bob, as you know it's a policy that
administrators step down when they are 65.

20:23.778 --> 20:26.562
Over the next few months we'll
be searching for your replacement.

20:27.202 --> 20:30.568
- Do me a favor and keep this between us.
- Of course.
