WEBVTT

00:08.060 --> 00:11.050
6 YEARS EARLIER

00:36.039 --> 00:37.090
Jesus!

00:54.200 --> 00:56.100
FERTILE DAY

00:59.179 --> 01:02.000
This little kitten gets me so
horny.

01:02.020 --> 01:04.129
6 YEARS LATER

01:09.060 --> 01:10.069
Hi.

01:18.120 --> 01:20.019
Oh, hang on, hang on.

01:31.140 --> 01:32.159
Do you like it that way, baby?

01:32.180 --> 01:35.159
Yeah, I love it, honey, it's so
sexy!

01:35.180 --> 01:37.140
Did you not take out your night
guard?

01:38.189 --> 01:41.189
What of it?
I can get you pregnant with it
too.

01:41.210 --> 01:43.229
-Jesus...
-Relax!

01:48.180 --> 01:49.200
Hello?

01:51.180 --> 01:52.210
What?

01:53.120 --> 01:55.120
No, no. Okay, it's fine.

01:55.189 --> 01:58.150
I'll take Paula to school
and deal with it, okay?

01:58.229 --> 02:00.010
Okay, thanks.

02:00.030 --> 02:01.120
Thanks, love you. Ciao.

02:01.219 --> 02:02.230
What's up?

02:03.079 --> 02:05.010
Genaro died!

02:05.140 --> 02:06.230
Jesus!

02:07.099 --> 02:10.069
Seems he's just there in the
garden...

02:10.090 --> 02:11.180
his body.

02:12.139 --> 02:13.090
Poor guy, huh?

02:15.199 --> 02:16.219
Jesus.

02:17.219 --> 02:20.180
But I didn't come, Cris.
Now what?

02:23.189 --> 02:25.060
I'll wake up the girls.

02:25.079 --> 02:27.229
PERFECT LIFE

02:28.120 --> 02:31.139
WHEN NOTHING IS WHAT IT SEEMS...

02:41.090 --> 02:44.099
-What are you doing?
-Nothing, I feel bloated.

02:48.039 --> 02:49.090
How are you doing?

02:50.000 --> 02:53.180
You spent all night
going to the fridge, then
vomiting.

02:53.199 --> 02:55.189
Are you making yourself vomit?

02:55.210 --> 02:56.150
As if!

02:57.159 --> 02:59.139
Why do you use loo paper
for a sanitary towel?

02:59.159 --> 03:00.210
Don't change the subject.

03:01.159 --> 03:03.099
Do you have an eating disorder?

03:03.229 --> 03:05.129
Of course I don't, Esther!

03:05.150 --> 03:07.219
I'm fine.
You're such a drama queen.

03:09.169 --> 03:12.060
I'm fine.
And you should use a mooncup.

03:14.150 --> 03:16.020
And I don't vomit!

03:18.009 --> 03:20.039
-Sorry about the delay.
-That's okay.

03:20.060 --> 03:23.050
Let's take a look at those
molars.
Open wide...

03:23.170 --> 03:24.180
A bit more.

03:25.099 --> 03:26.110
That's it...

03:27.159 --> 03:28.129
What the...

03:30.199 --> 03:31.229
María!

03:32.009 --> 03:33.199
I'm so sorry, Antonio!

03:42.039 --> 03:43.120
Of course.

03:44.060 --> 03:45.159
If there's no life on the Moon,

03:45.180 --> 03:48.189
we can send all of Earth's
rubbish there
and clean the planet.

03:48.210 --> 03:52.090
-But we'll ruin the lunar
landscape.
-There's no one there to see it.

03:52.170 --> 03:53.159
Excuse me.

03:53.180 --> 03:56.060
When are you going to remove the
body?

03:56.079 --> 03:58.110
It's like we told you,
we can't remove it,

03:58.129 --> 03:59.199
the police have to come.

03:59.219 --> 04:03.189
-I have to go to work.
-You're head of the residents'
association.

04:03.210 --> 04:06.120
I didn't run for it.
You take turns at it.

04:06.139 --> 04:09.050
-It's my turn next year.
-Prepare yourself.

04:09.069 --> 04:11.139
I'm in the middle of something,
Mery.

04:11.159 --> 04:13.210
-What's up?
-Genaro died.

04:13.229 --> 04:15.020
Who's Genaro?

04:15.039 --> 04:18.100
The caretaker,
the poor guy had a heart attack.

04:19.009 --> 04:20.029
Why are you calling?

04:20.050 --> 04:22.040
A colleague of mine
is looking for a gardener.

04:22.060 --> 04:25.189
Could you give me the details
of the guy who works at your
place?

04:25.209 --> 04:27.149
Which guy? There are loads.

04:27.209 --> 04:29.009
He was at Paula's party.

04:29.029 --> 04:30.069
Oh, Gari!

04:30.089 --> 04:32.139
-That's the one.
-He's a great lad.

04:32.159 --> 04:34.000
When they appointed me here,

04:34.019 --> 04:36.029
I insisted on hiring people like
him.

04:36.050 --> 04:38.139
-How do you mean?
-Sweetie, I've got to go.

04:38.159 --> 04:41.050
I'll send you the address now.
Love you.

04:41.069 --> 04:42.159
All right, love you. Ciao.

04:45.019 --> 04:47.159
-Will this take long?
-No.

04:50.060 --> 04:51.069
Let's go for it.

04:54.129 --> 04:57.000
-Cris.
-Sorry, Carlos. Genaro died.

04:57.019 --> 04:59.000
-Who's Genaro?
-My caretaker.

04:59.019 --> 05:00.209
-Your caretaker?
-It's awful...

05:34.230 --> 05:36.009
Hi there.

05:36.029 --> 05:37.079
-Good afternoon.
-How are you?

05:37.100 --> 05:39.159
A friend gave me your details,

05:39.180 --> 05:41.189
it's about hiring a gardener.

05:41.209 --> 05:44.069
Would that be for a regular
or one-off service?

05:44.090 --> 05:48.100
Well, it's for some bushes that
I have,
they're... a real mess.

05:48.120 --> 05:50.040
So it's a one-off service.

05:50.060 --> 05:51.090
Yes, yes.

05:51.180 --> 05:54.060
She recommended a young guy
who works here.

05:54.079 --> 05:55.189
-Yes?
-He's called Gari.

05:55.209 --> 05:59.009
Gari isn't available,
he's not here this week.

05:59.129 --> 06:02.029
But we do have other gardeners
if you're interested.

06:02.050 --> 06:06.120
The thing is, my friend really
liked Gari.

06:06.139 --> 06:08.120
Well, I don't mean she fancies
him.

06:08.139 --> 06:10.060
She likes how he tends to her
garden.

06:10.079 --> 06:11.230
I'll check the diary for you

06:12.009 --> 06:14.009
-and tell you when he's free.
-Perfect.

06:17.110 --> 06:19.089
SPECIAL EMPLOYMENT CENTRE

06:19.110 --> 06:21.120
Excuse me,
what's a special employment
centre?

06:21.139 --> 06:25.110
A centre where different people
with disabilities work.

06:26.029 --> 06:29.189
Learning disabilities,
functional or hearing
disabilities...

06:29.209 --> 06:30.110
Anna!

06:30.129 --> 06:32.170
-Yeah, what?
-Terranova are here!

06:32.189 --> 06:34.040
Can you come, please?

06:34.060 --> 06:36.060
-Yeah, I'll be there in a
second.
-Okay.

06:36.079 --> 06:37.129
I'll see to them.

06:37.149 --> 06:39.180
-Can you wait five minutes?
-Yes.

06:39.199 --> 06:43.029
-Do you all have disabilities?
-Yes, all of us.

06:43.050 --> 06:44.199
So...

06:46.050 --> 06:48.209
-Gari...
-Yes, we all have disabilities.

06:48.230 --> 06:52.009
All of us who work here
have disabilities.

06:52.029 --> 06:55.060
If you could just wait a second,
I'll see to them and be right
back.

07:04.079 --> 07:06.079
I don't care about social
networks!

07:06.100 --> 07:08.180
It's a great tool for your work.

07:08.199 --> 07:11.220
You become a slave to the
"likes",
think about it.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.220
No, really, you depend
on what the public thinks of
you.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.050
Artists engage with their public
through what they see.

07:18.069 --> 07:20.069
You need to use social media.

07:20.089 --> 07:23.009
You publish your photos,
people see you now and again.

07:23.029 --> 07:24.139
And so it's a brilliant way

07:24.160 --> 07:27.050
to stand the test of time
and be remembered when you die.

07:27.160 --> 07:29.230
But anyway, that's just my
opinion.

07:35.090 --> 07:37.069
Well, err...

07:37.149 --> 07:39.050
This is me. Yeah.

07:39.230 --> 07:41.139
This is me...

07:41.159 --> 07:44.159
Well, I'd invite you up,
but María is there.

07:45.019 --> 07:46.069
-Who's María?
-My sister.

07:46.090 --> 07:47.100
Oh, okay.

07:47.120 --> 07:50.060
She's going through a rough
patch
and I'd like to be with her.

07:50.079 --> 07:51.000
Oh, sure.

07:51.060 --> 07:52.120
She's bulimic.

07:52.139 --> 07:54.050
Shit. That sucks.

07:54.069 --> 07:56.090
A schoolfriend of mine
had a terrible time.

07:56.110 --> 07:58.220
I think it's the pressure to
look pretty.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.050
-We're totally forced to...
-Okay.

08:01.180 --> 08:04.029
-Thanks for the meal. It was
delicious.
-Sure thing.

08:04.050 --> 08:06.060
It got great ratings on the
Internet.

08:06.160 --> 08:07.230
-We'll be in touch.
-Okay.

08:08.009 --> 08:09.220
-Bye.
-Bye.

08:18.149 --> 08:20.189
What are you doing?
It's eleven at night!

08:20.209 --> 08:23.000
It's legal to do home repairs
until twelve.

08:23.019 --> 08:24.199
Will you quit that?

08:24.220 --> 08:26.089
-Will you quit that?
-No.

08:26.180 --> 08:29.100
You need a shelf.
All your books are on the floor.

08:29.120 --> 08:31.050
So what?
I love them on the floor!

08:31.069 --> 08:32.190
-It's vintage style.
-No.

08:32.210 --> 08:35.149
Vintage style means old
furniture,
not no furniture.

08:35.169 --> 08:38.000
Mery. Listen to me.

08:38.019 --> 08:40.230
I know you crawl into your shell
when you're having a bad time,

08:41.009 --> 08:43.059
but you can't go on this way.

08:43.120 --> 08:45.230
If you have bullimia,
you have to tell me.

08:46.059 --> 08:47.159
I don't have bullimia.

08:50.190 --> 08:52.100
I'm pregnant.

08:54.159 --> 08:55.230
You're what?

08:56.169 --> 08:58.169
-Is it Gustavo's?
-No, someone else.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.129
-Marc.
-What Marc?

09:01.149 --> 09:04.090
-Your ex.
-Come off it! That was ages ago.

09:05.169 --> 09:07.070
It was a one-night stand.

09:07.090 --> 09:10.100
-You screwed a guy without a
condom!
-Yes.

09:10.169 --> 09:13.159
What? I'm the only person in
Spain
who screwed without one.

09:13.179 --> 09:15.129
The rest of humanity is perfect.

09:15.149 --> 09:16.190
I didn't mean that.

09:16.210 --> 09:18.169
You know the shit you could
catch?

09:18.190 --> 09:21.220
If you get HPV
your fanny is a no-go zone for
life!

09:24.149 --> 09:26.220
I got tested the next day
and I'm fine.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.029
You're to blame: you drugged me.

09:29.049 --> 09:31.129
Did it happen
at Paula's birthday party?

09:32.080 --> 09:33.190
Who did you hook up with?

09:34.059 --> 09:36.049
-Who was it?
-I'm not telling you.

09:36.070 --> 09:37.149
-Tell me who!
-I don't want to!

09:37.169 --> 09:39.090
Tell me who got you pregnant!

09:39.110 --> 09:40.220
-No way.
-Tell me!

09:41.000 --> 09:42.059
A retard.

09:46.009 --> 09:47.120
Hey, come here. Come on.

09:48.090 --> 09:49.129
You don't get it.

09:49.200 --> 09:51.070
It's all right.

09:51.129 --> 09:53.220
Like I've never got off with
retards.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.009
A bunch of them.

09:57.090 --> 09:58.110
He's disabled.

10:00.029 --> 10:01.070
A paralysed guy?

10:01.090 --> 10:02.210
No, up here.

10:03.149 --> 10:05.080
Mentally disabled.

10:05.210 --> 10:08.019
-A retarded guy?
-Don't say that!

10:08.039 --> 10:10.000
You say "special needs".

10:10.059 --> 10:12.090
Do you really mean it?

10:13.029 --> 10:14.039
What do you think?

10:14.210 --> 10:18.149
But why?
Was it out of morbid
curiosity...?

10:19.059 --> 10:21.149
Morbid curiosity? No.

10:22.110 --> 10:25.179
Remember Forrest Gump? Sometimes
you could tell, sometimes you
couldn't?

10:25.200 --> 10:27.139
Well this guy is the same.

10:27.159 --> 10:30.179
But it was totally obvious all
the time
in the film.

10:31.090 --> 10:33.179
You couldn't tell he was all the
time!

11:11.059 --> 11:12.200
-Hi, love.
-Hi, darling.

11:13.120 --> 11:15.149
How are you? I'm exhausted.

11:17.220 --> 11:19.100
How was work?

11:20.000 --> 11:20.200
Great.

11:20.220 --> 11:23.029
We got a really important
client...

11:23.110 --> 11:24.190
So that was good.

11:24.210 --> 11:26.009
Brilliant.

11:31.179 --> 11:33.059
How about you, love?

11:35.039 --> 11:36.059
Love...

12:56.120 --> 13:00.049
It all depends whether
the father's disability is
genetic

13:00.070 --> 13:02.070
or due to external factors.

13:02.090 --> 13:03.230
What external factors?

13:04.009 --> 13:06.210
Medication that was wrongly
prescribed
during pregnancy,

13:06.230 --> 13:10.049
an accident,
a difficult birth...

13:10.169 --> 13:14.110
In all these cases, the person's
DNA
should remain intact.

13:14.129 --> 13:17.029
And the alteration is not passed
on
to the baby.

13:18.009 --> 13:20.129
Do you know if the disability...

13:20.190 --> 13:23.110
is genetic or due to an
accident?

13:24.039 --> 13:25.090
No.

13:25.210 --> 13:27.049
I don't know anything.

13:29.190 --> 13:31.059
Well in this case...

13:32.080 --> 13:34.000
you have two options:

13:34.169 --> 13:36.049
do this test...

13:37.129 --> 13:39.159
or ask the father.

13:45.220 --> 13:47.159
The plaintiff's documents

13:47.179 --> 13:50.129
include evidence that he has
100,000 euros in Panama.

13:50.149 --> 13:54.009
We could request a letters
rogatory
so they give us information.

13:54.139 --> 13:57.029
As it's Panama, it'll be tough.

13:57.049 --> 13:59.220
There needs to be solid proof
that this may be commission of a
crime.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.090
But you just said
your client had evidence.

14:02.110 --> 14:03.220
Just a second. This is urgent.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.059
-Sorry.
-Okay.

14:10.019 --> 14:11.049
Pablo.

14:11.070 --> 14:13.159
My mom sprained something,
she can't pick up the girls.

14:13.179 --> 14:14.230
Can you do it?

14:16.190 --> 14:18.029
What about your parents...?

14:18.139 --> 14:20.059
Right. Okay.

14:20.190 --> 14:22.080
No, no. I'll sort it out.

14:23.070 --> 14:24.129
Call you right back.

14:24.149 --> 14:26.090
Hey, what's up? We were just...

14:26.110 --> 14:28.110
We decided to take a break.

14:28.129 --> 14:29.159
-A cigarette break.
-Oh.

14:29.179 --> 14:31.139
-You don't smoke anymore?
-No.

14:32.110 --> 14:34.129
-Is everything okay?
-Yes. Absolutely fine.

14:34.149 --> 14:36.210
I may have to leave the meeting
a bit earlier.

14:36.230 --> 14:39.210
Okay. Listen,
I know it's not my business,
but...

14:40.080 --> 14:43.070
why don't you think about
reducing
your working day?

14:43.090 --> 14:45.070
You'd have more time
to be with the kids.

14:45.090 --> 14:48.009
María José asked for it
and she's over the moon.

14:48.149 --> 14:50.049
No, thank you so much.

14:50.070 --> 14:51.230
But I've got it all under
control.

14:52.009 --> 14:53.029
This is a one-off thing.

14:53.049 --> 14:54.049
-Sure?
-Yes.

14:54.120 --> 14:56.110
Hey, back here in 15 minutes.

15:03.110 --> 15:05.080
Two days ago I was getting
married...

15:05.230 --> 15:09.129
and now I don't know what kind
of disability my baby's father
has.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.049
And I don't know if I can go up
to someone
and say:

15:12.070 --> 15:15.009
"Excuse me,
what type of disability do you
have?

15:15.029 --> 15:17.169
It's important,
because I'm having your kid...".

15:20.100 --> 15:22.070
Or maybe I should do that.

15:22.179 --> 15:24.000
What do you think?

15:24.179 --> 15:27.110
-Esther, are you listening to
me?
-No.

15:27.179 --> 15:28.159
-Listen to me.
-Sorry.

15:28.179 --> 15:31.120
I'm looking
at this shitty social media
thing.

15:31.139 --> 15:33.179
Should I open an Instagram
account?

15:33.200 --> 15:35.159
Of course you should!

15:35.179 --> 15:37.190
Should have done it four years
ago.

15:37.210 --> 15:40.190
Otherwise, people don't know
you're a painter or what you do.

15:42.090 --> 15:44.090
Maybe Gari is on social media!

15:44.110 --> 15:45.190
-Shall I look for him?
-Yeah.

15:49.190 --> 15:50.200
Can I have it?

15:52.049 --> 15:53.009
Cris.

15:53.120 --> 15:54.220
-What's up?
-Mery...

15:55.000 --> 15:56.179
Could you pick up the girls?

15:56.200 --> 15:57.110
Sure.

15:57.230 --> 16:01.029
-I have to go to the funeral
home.
-Why? What happened?

16:01.049 --> 16:02.190
Jesus, Mery. Because Genaro
died.

16:02.210 --> 16:04.149
Oh, right. Sorry.

16:04.169 --> 16:07.200
Hey, did you speak to Gari?
Poor thing was really upset.

16:08.070 --> 16:10.049
Of course, he'll be at the
funeral home.

16:10.129 --> 16:12.139
-Funeral home?
-Cris's caretaker died.

16:13.019 --> 16:15.080
Okay, I'll pick them up
and take them there.

16:15.100 --> 16:17.000
All right, love you. Ciao.

16:19.200 --> 16:21.019
Got plans this afternoon?

16:21.230 --> 16:23.080
No way!

16:23.100 --> 16:25.200
-Come on.
-No, dead people creep me out!

16:25.220 --> 16:27.129
And you know what happens
afterwards.

16:27.149 --> 16:29.179
I dream I die
and no one goes to my funeral.

16:29.200 --> 16:32.200
I'm not going!
Wouldn't be seen dead there!

16:33.220 --> 16:37.070
If you were on social media
people would know you died.

16:39.009 --> 16:41.019
I promise I'll go to your
funeral!

16:41.200 --> 16:44.039
You plan to tell him you're
pregnant here?

16:44.059 --> 16:46.159
No, I'll ask him about his
disability.

16:47.009 --> 16:48.090
What do I do?

16:48.110 --> 16:50.100
Look after the kids,
give your condolences.

16:50.120 --> 16:53.100
I don't know how to.
I'll give them the chocolates
and I'm off.

16:55.110 --> 16:56.149
It gives me the willies.

16:57.049 --> 16:59.019
Looks like an airport departure
board.

16:59.039 --> 17:01.009
Where do dead people go?

17:01.090 --> 17:02.190
Nowhere.

17:03.090 --> 17:05.059
Depends on their faith.

17:05.190 --> 17:08.009
-Do you know Gari, your
gardener?
-Sure.

17:08.029 --> 17:11.000
Listen, you go and look for him
really quickly, okay?

17:11.019 --> 17:13.000
-If you find him, you get a
prize.
-Okay!

17:13.019 --> 17:15.059
Off you go! Look for him, fetch!

17:15.160 --> 17:18.079
You know a little girl and a dog
aren't the same thing?

17:19.109 --> 17:21.109
Paula, Paula!

17:46.180 --> 17:47.210
Sandra?

17:49.000 --> 17:51.029
Sorry, I didn't mean to bother
you.

17:51.049 --> 17:53.089
Come over here. You're no
bother.

17:59.210 --> 18:03.099
I'm so glad you came.
I thought nobody would turn up.

18:05.170 --> 18:08.009
Why wouldn't I come?

18:15.039 --> 18:17.130
Here, I brought you some...

18:18.160 --> 18:19.170
chocolates.

18:20.119 --> 18:21.140
Thanks.

18:31.210 --> 18:34.059
Hi, Cris. We're on a sort of
terrace

18:34.079 --> 18:37.069
at the back of the funeral home,
there are some bushes...

18:37.089 --> 18:39.039
I'm here with Paula and Martina.

18:39.059 --> 18:41.059
And Martina pooed herself!

18:42.029 --> 18:45.130
We're on a sort of terrace
at the back of the funeral home,

18:45.150 --> 18:48.039
there are some bushes.
I'm here with Paula and Martina.

18:48.099 --> 18:50.109
And Martina pooed herself!

18:53.059 --> 18:55.049
Jesus! For fuck's sake!

18:55.069 --> 18:56.079
Need a light?

18:56.190 --> 18:58.119
Yes, thanks.

18:59.079 --> 19:00.109
There you go.

19:04.220 --> 19:06.160
-Thanks.
-Keep it.

19:07.099 --> 19:09.140
I mean it. I always lose them.

19:10.039 --> 19:12.089
I like to think they help others
get a light.

19:12.109 --> 19:14.130
Giving a light to the needy.

19:17.160 --> 19:18.150
Sorry.

19:18.170 --> 19:20.000
So sorry.

19:20.019 --> 19:22.009
I'm having a bit of a full-on
day.

19:22.029 --> 19:24.049
We are at a funeral home after
all.

19:24.170 --> 19:26.039
That's quite normal.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.220
Was it someone close to you?

19:31.000 --> 19:32.150
A friend's granddad.

19:33.160 --> 19:36.039
-How about you?
-Our residential area's
caretaker.

19:36.220 --> 19:39.069
Very posh! You have a caretaker.

19:40.079 --> 19:41.230
Well, not anymore.

19:42.009 --> 19:43.079
Because he's dead.

19:45.200 --> 19:47.119
That's another typical thing.

19:47.210 --> 19:49.019
Laughing at funerals.

19:49.039 --> 19:50.150
Basic emotions.

19:50.210 --> 19:52.029
Exactly.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.019
-I have to go.
-Me too.

20:03.130 --> 20:04.140
Listen...

20:06.069 --> 20:08.019
Is it weird if I give you my
number?

20:08.119 --> 20:10.019
You can do.

20:10.119 --> 20:13.029
Thing is,
I don't think I'll be calling
you.

20:13.140 --> 20:15.089
I won't even be texting you.

20:15.210 --> 20:17.230
It's fine if you'd rather I
didn't.

20:18.119 --> 20:21.190
We say goodbye here: each to his
own
and God watching over everyone.

20:22.130 --> 20:24.079
I don't believe in God, either.

20:34.009 --> 20:35.150
Six what?

20:39.130 --> 20:40.190
Yeuch, disgusting.

20:40.210 --> 20:42.059
My sister is disgusting?

20:42.079 --> 20:44.109
Huh? No. Poo is disgusting.

20:45.039 --> 20:46.130
Gari!

20:46.210 --> 20:48.130
-There's Gari!
-What?

20:49.019 --> 20:51.089
Gari, Gari! Come here, come
here!

20:52.220 --> 20:54.009
No.

20:54.210 --> 20:56.210
We were looking for you.

20:56.230 --> 20:58.000
-Hi.
-Hi.

20:58.019 --> 20:59.000
How are you?

21:00.119 --> 21:02.220
Sorry, I don't remember your
name.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.099
-María.
-Oh, right. María.

21:05.119 --> 21:07.150
-I'm Gari.
-Give me some wet wipes.

21:07.170 --> 21:09.150
I don't know if you remember...

21:09.170 --> 21:10.200
Yes, I do remember.

21:10.220 --> 21:12.079
Oh, okay.

21:12.099 --> 21:15.119
-Glad to see you, Gari.
-Same here, María. Yeah.

21:16.230 --> 21:19.119
That's... poo you've got there.

21:19.140 --> 21:20.119
-Yes, it is.
-Martina's.

21:20.140 --> 21:22.130
Want me to hold her?
So you can clean it off?

21:22.150 --> 21:24.089
-Can you?
-Yeah, sure I can.

21:24.109 --> 21:26.039
I'll pick her up.

21:26.109 --> 21:27.140
Hiya.

21:27.160 --> 21:29.190
-Hiya, Martina!
-Pass me the wet wipes.

21:29.210 --> 21:32.079
Come to Gari!

21:32.099 --> 21:34.089
-How are you? Hiya!
-How many?

21:34.109 --> 21:36.160
-Two.
-You did a big poo, didn't you?

21:36.180 --> 21:38.130
Look at the poo you did.

21:38.150 --> 21:41.019
Here are a few.
For your trousers, too.

21:41.039 --> 21:42.049
Huh?

21:42.130 --> 21:43.190
Know what, Martina?

21:44.099 --> 21:47.220
You're going to be
a really clever little girl.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.170
Look, you have some poo as well.

21:59.109 --> 22:01.119
Before going on, I'd like to say

22:01.140 --> 22:06.089
that Genaro was really fond
of plumed cock's comb,

22:06.109 --> 22:10.119
which is a plant that blooms
from spring to autumn.

22:10.140 --> 22:13.069
He didn't like roses at all,
though.

22:14.170 --> 22:17.180
I'm sorry for the person
who placed them here, but

22:18.059 --> 22:19.109
I think...

22:20.019 --> 22:24.150
that you should take them off
the coffin. Thank you.

22:33.019 --> 22:34.210
Five years ago...

22:37.039 --> 22:39.130
I started working as a gardener.

22:40.130 --> 22:43.029
I was really scared to begin
with,

22:44.119 --> 22:46.160
but I was fortunate enough...

22:48.109 --> 22:50.160
to work with Genaro.

23:00.140 --> 23:02.150
Genaro...

23:03.140 --> 23:06.069
taught me a lot of things.

23:07.069 --> 23:08.130
An awful lot.

23:09.180 --> 23:11.029
In the beginning...

23:11.150 --> 23:13.230
I was afraid I wouldn't measure
up to it.

23:15.079 --> 23:16.200
I don't mean my height.

23:17.119 --> 23:20.130
I mean not doing things
properly.

23:22.009 --> 23:24.079
It was all so new to me and...

23:25.059 --> 23:27.049
I felt lost.

23:27.210 --> 23:31.059
Genaro always helped me in
everything.

23:31.079 --> 23:35.190
I remember that we used to play
dominoes
when we had time off.

23:36.079 --> 23:37.160
And Genaro...

23:39.009 --> 23:40.170
never let me win.

23:43.039 --> 23:46.150
Genaro never treated me
differently
because of the way I am.

23:50.029 --> 23:51.069
Never.

24:05.019 --> 24:06.049
Gari.

24:07.140 --> 24:08.170
-Hi.
-Hi.

24:08.190 --> 24:10.150
-That was a great speech.
-Thanks.

24:10.170 --> 24:11.160
You're welcome.

24:15.059 --> 24:16.170
Are you following me?

24:17.220 --> 24:19.190
No. It looks that way, right?

24:20.079 --> 24:22.210
-No.
-Listen, María, if...

24:22.230 --> 24:25.130
If you're here about the other
day,

24:25.150 --> 24:26.230
I'm sorry.

24:27.089 --> 24:29.069
What I mean is that, that...

24:29.190 --> 24:31.190
It shouldn't have happened.

24:32.109 --> 24:35.049
Especially not during my working
hours,
you know?

24:37.230 --> 24:39.069
I'm pregnant.

24:42.109 --> 24:43.130
Congratulations.

24:46.119 --> 24:47.190
It's yours.
