01:47:04.192 --> 01:47:07.110
Ha, ha. No, I didn't steal it.

01:47:07.278 --> 01:47:09.404
It's a present for you to keep.

01:47:09.572 --> 01:47:11.823
A Merry Christmas, Tiny Tim.

01:47:13.242 --> 01:47:15.493
You still don't recognize me,
do you, Bob Cratchit?

01:47:15.703 --> 01:47:17.829
Yes. Uh, no.

01:47:17.997 --> 01:47:20.415
- You're Father Christmas?
- No.

01:47:20.625 --> 01:47:21.666
[SHRIEKS]

01:47:21.834 --> 01:47:24.211
It's Mr. Scrooge. He's gone mad.

01:47:24.378 --> 01:47:26.963
It's all right, my dear.
There's nothing to be frightened of.

01:47:27.173 --> 01:47:28.506
No, I haven't gone mad.

01:47:28.674 --> 01:47:31.301
And on Monday
when your salary will be doubled...

01:47:31.469 --> 01:47:32.510
Doubled? He has gone mad.

01:47:32.678 --> 01:47:35.472
- We'll sit together and discuss
how I can help your family.

01:47:35.640 --> 01:47:39.893
To start with, we'll find the right
doctors to get Tiny Tim well.

01:47:40.061 --> 01:47:42.187
And we will get him well,
you know, Bob.

01:47:42.355 --> 01:47:45.023
Yes, I believe you.
I'll believe anything.

01:47:45.191 --> 01:47:49.778
And may this be the merriest
Christmas of all our lives.

01:47:49.987 --> 01:47:51.029
[CHEERING]

01:47:51.197 --> 01:47:53.114
Tom Jenkins, Tom Jenkins.

01:47:53.282 --> 01:47:55.033
About that 6 pounds you owe me.

01:47:55.201 --> 01:47:57.452
You agreed to give me
a few more days, I just need...

01:47:57.620 --> 01:48:01.289
You can keep it.
It's my Christmas present to you.

01:48:01.457 --> 01:48:04.793
God bless you this Christmas day,
Mr. Scrooge.

01:48:05.002 --> 01:48:06.836
Thank you very much.

01:48:07.004 --> 01:48:08.380
[SINGING]
Thank you very much

01:48:08.547 --> 01:48:12.676
That's the nicest thing
That anyone's ever done for me

01:48:12.885 --> 01:48:14.803
It sounds a bit bizarre

01:48:14.971 --> 01:48:20.392
But things the way they are
I feel as if another life's begun for me

01:48:22.561 --> 01:48:25.897
And that goes for anyone else
who owes me money, you can keep it.

01:48:26.065 --> 01:48:30.235
As of this day,
all my debts are ended.

01:48:30.861 --> 01:48:34.906
[ALL SINGING] And if I had a drum
I'd have to bang it

01:48:35.074 --> 01:48:39.661
To add a sort of
Humpty Dumpty touch

01:48:41.038 --> 01:48:44.499
But since I left my drummer at home
I'll simply have to say

01:48:44.667 --> 01:48:49.045
Thank you very, very, very much

01:48:49.213 --> 01:48:51.047
PUPPETS [SINGING]:
Thank you very much

01:48:51.215 --> 01:48:52.716
Thank you very much

01:48:52.925 --> 01:48:56.761
That's the nicest thing
That anyone's ever done for me

01:48:56.971 --> 01:48:58.805
It isn't every day

01:48:59.015 --> 01:49:00.807
Good fortune comes my way

01:49:01.017 --> 01:49:04.936
I never thought
The future would be fun for me

01:49:08.983 --> 01:49:12.861
And if I had a bugle I would blow it

01:49:13.029 --> 01:49:17.198
To add a sort of
How's your father touch

01:49:17.408 --> 01:49:21.119
But since I left my bugle at home
I'll simply have to say

01:49:21.287 --> 01:49:23.038
Gentlemen, Merry Christmas.

01:49:23.247 --> 01:49:25.206
ALL:
Merry Christmas, Mr. Scrooge.

01:49:25.416 --> 01:49:27.292
Come to my office
on Monday morning

01:49:27.460 --> 01:49:30.754
and I will give you a hundred guineas
for your most worthy cause.

01:49:30.963 --> 01:49:32.589
And the same every Christmas.

01:49:32.757 --> 01:49:35.216
Thank you very, very much,
Mr. Scrooge.

01:49:36.677 --> 01:49:41.973
[ALL SINGING]
Thank you very, very, very much

01:49:42.850 --> 01:49:46.686
Thank you very much

01:49:46.896 --> 01:49:50.690
That's the nicest thing
That anyone's ever done for me

01:49:50.858 --> 01:49:52.609
The future looks all right

01:49:52.777 --> 01:49:54.652
In fact it looks so bright

01:49:54.820 --> 01:49:59.157
I feel as if they're polishing
The sun for me

01:49:59.367 --> 01:50:04.287
- Sing a Christmas carol
- Sing a Christmas carol

01:50:04.497 --> 01:50:09.000
Sing a Christmas carol
Like the children do

01:50:09.210 --> 01:50:12.754
And if I had a cannon I would fire it

01:50:12.922 --> 01:50:17.008
To add a sort of celebration touch

01:50:17.385 --> 01:50:18.968
And enjoy the beauty

01:50:19.136 --> 01:50:22.347
All the joy and beauty
That a Merry Christmas...

01:50:22.556 --> 01:50:26.226
And since I left my cannon at home

01:50:26.435 --> 01:50:29.979
- I'll simply have to say
- Christmas is here

01:50:30.189 --> 01:50:37.904
Thank you very, very, very much

01:50:38.739 --> 01:50:41.783
Thank you very much

01:50:41.951 --> 01:50:46.121
That's the nicest thing
That anyone's ever done for me

01:50:46.288 --> 01:50:50.166
I may sound double Dutch
But my delight is such

01:50:50.334 --> 01:50:52.335
I feel as if a losing war

01:50:52.545 --> 01:50:54.212
- Has been won for me
- Come along, boys.

01:50:54.380 --> 01:50:58.133
And if I had a flag
I'd hang me flag out

01:50:58.342 --> 01:51:04.180
To add a sort of final victory touch

01:51:04.348 --> 01:51:07.725
But since I left me flag at home

01:51:08.436 --> 01:51:10.937
I'll simply have to say

01:51:11.105 --> 01:51:13.356
[PANTING]

01:51:13.524 --> 01:51:17.819
Thank you very much
Thank you very much

01:51:17.987 --> 01:51:19.946
Thank you very much

Thank you very, very, very much

01:51:36.130 --> 01:51:41.134
Merry Christmas.

[LAUGHING]

01:52:08.120 --> 01:52:10.079
Hello.

01:52:10.748 --> 01:52:14.459
I don't know whether you can hear me,
old Jacob Marley.

01:52:14.627 --> 01:52:19.214
And I don't know whether or not
I imagined the things I saw.

01:52:19.381 --> 01:52:21.799
But between the pair of us we...

01:52:21.967 --> 01:52:26.471
We finally made a Merry Christmas,
didn't we?

01:52:27.890 --> 01:52:29.891
I have to leave you now.

01:52:30.059 --> 01:52:32.310
Must go and get ready.

01:52:32.478 --> 01:52:37.190
I'm going to have Christmas dinner
with my family.
