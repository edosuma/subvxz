WEBVTT

00:16.884 --> 00:18.884
>> DEE: My apartment is not a
spa.

00:18.886 --> 00:20.953
>> FRANK: Dennis and I are gonna
take a soak.

00:20.955 --> 00:22.621
>> You and Dennis are going to
bathe together?

00:22.623 --> 00:24.323
>> It's that Turkish bath thing.

00:24.325 --> 00:26.792
What are you worried about?
>> I'm not worried about

00:26.794 --> 00:28.727
anything, but my apartment is
not a Turkish bath, okay?

00:28.729 --> 00:30.662
>> Well, Dee, you know, this is
Dennis's apartment now, too.

00:30.664 --> 00:31.663
>> No. No, goddamn it, it's not,

00:31.665 --> 00:32.865
all right?

00:32.867 --> 00:34.133
Mac and Dennis do not live here.

00:34.135 --> 00:35.334
Just... So sick of you guys

00:35.336 --> 00:36.568
doing your stupid shit in

00:36.570 --> 00:37.736
my place.

00:37.738 --> 00:40.139
(all grunting rhythmically)

00:40.141 --> 00:41.340
>> What the hell is this?!

00:41.342 --> 00:42.574
>> MAC: One more! Wah!

00:42.576 --> 00:43.709
>> CHARLIE: Stop!

00:43.711 --> 00:44.977
(whooping, glass breaking)

00:44.979 --> 00:46.145
>> Hey!

00:46.147 --> 00:47.346
>> Oh!

00:47.348 --> 00:48.547
>> Good set, boys!

00:48.549 --> 00:49.748
>> What are you doing?

00:49.750 --> 00:51.316
>> Oh, Dee, this is Jojo,

00:51.318 --> 00:52.351
Tiny, Charlie you know.

00:52.353 --> 00:53.652
>> I don't care.

00:53.654 --> 00:55.487
>> Together, we are Ass Kickers
United.

00:55.489 --> 00:57.756
>> Oh, you guys, come on,
please, I don't want you doing

00:57.758 --> 00:58.891
your weird routines in here!

00:58.893 --> 00:59.858
>> It's not a routine, Dee, and

00:59.860 --> 01:01.026
there is nothing weird about

01:01.028 --> 01:02.194
this, okay?

01:02.196 --> 01:03.395
Ass Kickers United is a way of

01:03.397 --> 01:04.663
life, based on the life

01:04.665 --> 01:07.066
improvement teachings of the
Master.

01:07.068 --> 01:09.435
>> What kind of cult shit is
that?

01:09.437 --> 01:11.703
>> No, no, it's not a cult,
Frank.

01:11.705 --> 01:12.671
The Master is the only human to

01:12.673 --> 01:13.739
ever achieve enlightenment

01:13.741 --> 01:14.706
through the way of the warrior.

01:14.708 --> 01:15.941
>> Stop, two, three.

01:15.943 --> 01:18.911
>> One, two, three, four. Stop.

01:42.303 --> 01:45.104
>> Come on! Goddamn it!

01:45.106 --> 01:46.405
Frank, I can't get this Fight

01:46.407 --> 01:48.140
Milk out of the goddamn couch!

01:48.142 --> 01:49.942
Oh! Shit!

01:49.944 --> 01:51.577
It burned a hole in the cushion!

01:51.579 --> 01:52.744
>> That's probably the crotein.

01:52.746 --> 01:53.946
Don't get that on your skin!

01:53.948 --> 01:55.147
>> DENNIS: Oh! Frank, Frank,

01:55.149 --> 01:56.315
sorry I'm late, man, but, uh,

01:56.317 --> 01:57.583
good news.

01:57.585 --> 01:58.784
I brought checkers.

01:58.786 --> 01:59.952
Oh, what's up, Dee?

01:59.954 --> 02:01.153
I got dominoes, and what the

02:01.155 --> 02:02.387
hell is going on?

02:02.389 --> 02:03.555
Your place looks like shit.

02:03.557 --> 02:04.790
What happened?

02:04.792 --> 02:05.924
>> Yeah, yeah, it does.

02:05.926 --> 02:06.925
I'll tell you what happened.

02:06.927 --> 02:07.960
Mac and his goddamn Ass Blasters

02:07.962 --> 02:08.961
Incorporated were in here

02:08.963 --> 02:10.095
jerking around all day.

02:10.097 --> 02:11.330
>> Mac, Charlie and a bunch of

02:11.332 --> 02:12.564
goons started a queer club.

02:12.566 --> 02:13.765
>> Hmm.

02:13.767 --> 02:14.933
>> They got a newsletter.

02:14.935 --> 02:16.135
>> Oh, shit.

02:16.137 --> 02:17.336
<i> Ass Kickers United.</i>

02:17.338 --> 02:18.303
Oh, my God.

02:18.305 --> 02:19.771
>> What?

02:19.773 --> 02:22.107
>> Dee, Mac didn't start this
club.

02:22.109 --> 02:23.308
I did.

02:23.310 --> 02:24.576
>> What are you talking about?

02:24.578 --> 02:25.744
>> Yeah. I, uh... I just made

02:25.746 --> 02:26.945
this shit up about Ass Kickers

02:26.947 --> 02:28.113
United to get Mac to stop eating

02:28.115 --> 02:29.348
my Thin Mints.

02:29.350 --> 02:30.516
>> Huh?

02:30.518 --> 02:31.750
>> You know how Mac is all

02:31.752 --> 02:32.985
irritating and shit?

02:32.987 --> 02:34.786
>> Of course.
>> The worst!

02:34.788 --> 02:36.355
>> Right, well, he was doing all

02:36.357 --> 02:37.689
this irritating shit, and he was
driving me crazy.

02:37.691 --> 02:39.525
Worst of all, he was eating all

02:39.527 --> 02:41.527
my Thin Mint cookies, and, so,
you know, playing on Mac's

02:41.529 --> 02:43.695
physical insecurities, I decided
I would get in his head a little

02:43.697 --> 02:46.031
bit, so I created this Master
character, all right?

02:46.033 --> 02:48.033
I typed up this newsletter,
which was, you know, mostly

02:48.035 --> 02:50.035
about fitness and, like, just
kicking ass at life in general,

02:50.037 --> 02:51.837
just kind of speaking Mac's
language.

02:51.839 --> 02:53.438
But mostly, I was speaking of

02:53.440 --> 02:55.607
the dangers of consuming too
many Thin Mint cookies.

02:55.609 --> 02:57.609
And I'll tell you, man, it
worked like a charm, 'cause he

02:57.611 --> 02:59.811
stopped eating Thin Mints almost
immediately.

02:59.813 --> 03:02.014
>> That is extremely impressive.
>> Oh.

03:02.016 --> 03:03.882
>> Dennis, I missed most of that
last part.

03:03.884 --> 03:05.450
Run it by me again.

03:05.452 --> 03:06.618
>> Frank, I just spoke for five
straight minutes.

03:06.620 --> 03:08.453
I'm not doing it again.

03:08.455 --> 03:10.389
>> Dennis started a cult.
>> No, I didn't start a cult.

03:10.391 --> 03:11.557
>> Yeah, sure sounds like a
cult.

03:11.559 --> 03:13.492
Hey, I got a great idea.

03:13.494 --> 03:15.360
Why don't you type up another
newsletter and tell Mac and his

03:15.362 --> 03:17.329
dum-dum friends to go and fix
up your apartment, right?

03:17.331 --> 03:19.198
That way, you guys can get the
hell out of my place.

03:19.200 --> 03:21.400
>> Or maybe get some broads
involved.

03:21.402 --> 03:23.468
Cults are great for attracting
New Age tail.

03:23.470 --> 03:25.304
>> No, guys, you can't go
straight to fixing apartments

03:25.306 --> 03:27.506
and getting young, New Age tail.
You can't do that.

03:27.508 --> 03:29.675
That takes years of
brainwashing.

03:29.677 --> 03:31.577
>> But here's the problem.
If you don't do that and write

03:31.579 --> 03:33.512
the newsletter and fix up the
apartment, then I'm just gonna

03:33.514 --> 03:35.347
rat you out.
>> No. Come on, Dee.

03:35.349 --> 03:37.015
>> I'm gonna have to, I'm gonna
have to. You know why?

03:37.017 --> 03:38.584
'Cause I'm up to here.

03:38.586 --> 03:40.586
All right, I've had a very bad
day, all right?!

03:40.588 --> 03:42.221
I'm at the end of my rope, if
I'm being honest.

03:42.223 --> 03:43.388
>> Okay, okay, Dee, calm down.

03:43.390 --> 03:44.423
All right, look, I'll test the

03:44.425 --> 03:45.557
waters a little bit, okay, see

03:45.559 --> 03:46.658
if we can get 'em there slowly.

03:46.660 --> 03:47.593
>> Maybe you can get 'em to eat

03:47.595 --> 03:48.594
a shit sandwich.

03:48.596 --> 03:49.661
That would be fun.

03:49.663 --> 03:50.729
>> Why the hell would I...?

03:50.731 --> 03:51.763
What? No, this isn't about fun.

03:51.765 --> 03:52.831
This is about... it's about Thin

03:52.833 --> 03:53.832
Mints, goddamn it! Right?

03:53.834 --> 03:54.766
And the reason I'm so good at

03:54.768 --> 03:57.336
this is because I take it
seriously.

03:57.338 --> 04:01.006
Now, just watch and learn.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.076
>> Listen up!

04:04.078 --> 04:05.711
According to the Master, guys,

04:05.713 --> 04:07.179
we're not getting enough vitamin

04:07.181 --> 04:09.214
D, so these stickers harness

04:09.216 --> 04:10.749
the power of the sun and deliver

04:10.751 --> 04:14.753
it directly to our bodies, okay?

04:14.755 --> 04:15.887
And, apparently, guys, there's

04:15.889 --> 04:17.089
another exercise.

04:17.091 --> 04:18.223
>> Yes, sensei!

04:18.225 --> 04:19.424
>> Yeah!

04:19.426 --> 04:20.459
>> All right, now, they're

04:20.461 --> 04:21.426
called hammer jerks, and it's

04:21.428 --> 04:23.061
sort of like a... hammer, then

04:23.063 --> 04:24.229
you bend.

04:24.231 --> 04:25.430
>> Mm-hmm.

04:25.432 --> 04:26.632
>> Then you snap, then you jerk.

04:26.634 --> 04:27.899
>> Ow.

04:27.901 --> 04:29.067
>> Then a hammer.

04:29.069 --> 04:30.235
>> Hammer.

04:30.237 --> 04:31.436
>> Ow! Bend.

04:31.438 --> 04:32.704
>> Bend, snap.

04:32.706 --> 04:33.872
>> Damn it.

04:33.874 --> 04:35.073
>> Jerk.

04:35.075 --> 04:36.241
>> Oh, yeah.

04:36.243 --> 04:37.476
>> Hammer, bend, snap, jerk.

04:37.478 --> 04:38.644
Hammer...

04:38.646 --> 04:39.711
>> I can't believe they went for

04:39.713 --> 04:40.812
the sticker thing.

04:40.814 --> 04:42.080
>> Thank you. Thank you.

04:42.082 --> 04:44.082
>> Okay, so, time to dial it up
a notch.

04:44.084 --> 04:46.251
Let's put 'em to work and get
'em to your apartment.

04:46.253 --> 04:48.487
>> Yeah, we can't just dive into
that shit.

04:48.489 --> 04:50.622
We talked about this.
It's a slow burn.

04:50.624 --> 04:52.724
>> They're wearing sticks on
their heads. They're there.

04:52.726 --> 04:54.660
>> Look, look, look, stop.
You guys are going crazy.

04:54.662 --> 04:56.928
You're gonna blow the Thin Mint
thing.

04:56.930 --> 04:59.097
Will you just trust me?
I got this.

04:59.099 --> 05:01.266
I am the Master.
I'm gonna get you what you want.

05:01.268 --> 05:03.335
You just got to let me do my
thing.

05:03.337 --> 05:04.336
>> That-that-that sounds good.

05:04.338 --> 05:05.737
>> Mm, yeah, okay.

05:05.739 --> 05:07.739
>> You gonna goddamn blow this
for me?

05:07.741 --> 05:09.141
>> No.

05:09.143 --> 05:11.276
>> You gonna blow the Thin
Mint thing?

05:11.278 --> 05:14.613
>> No.

05:14.615 --> 05:15.647
(typing)

05:15.649 --> 05:16.815
>> "The Master sayeth."

05:16.817 --> 05:17.983
>> Mm-hmm.

05:17.985 --> 05:20.952
>> "Kicking ass in life is all

05:20.954 --> 05:21.920
about drywall."

05:21.922 --> 05:23.288
>> And pussy. Put "pussy."

05:23.290 --> 05:25.691
>> Goddamn, Frank, don't say
"pussy."

05:25.693 --> 05:26.958
It's disgusting.

05:26.960 --> 05:28.160
I'm not putting it.

05:28.162 --> 05:29.328
>> Hmm.

05:29.330 --> 05:31.997
>> "To be a total badass, you

05:31.999 --> 05:34.299
must learn carpentry."

05:34.301 --> 05:35.467
>> Hmm.

05:35.469 --> 05:38.136
>> "Fixing apartments is what

05:38.138 --> 05:39.338
you must do."

05:39.340 --> 05:41.640
>> And buy Wolf Cola.

05:41.642 --> 05:42.808
Let's make some coin.

05:42.810 --> 05:44.009
>> Okay.

05:44.011 --> 05:47.346
"And buy Wolf Cola, the only

05:47.348 --> 05:48.547
cola for true refreshment."

05:48.549 --> 05:49.781
>> That's good.

05:49.783 --> 05:50.949
>> "Splash into the beast."

05:50.951 --> 05:52.050
>> Mm-hmm, that's great.

05:52.052 --> 05:53.318
>> I know it is.

05:53.320 --> 05:55.787
Cool it with the jerky, will
you?

05:55.789 --> 05:56.888
You're driving me nuts.

05:56.890 --> 05:57.956
>> Now, put-put "bring pussy."

05:57.958 --> 05:58.890
>> Goddamn it. All right.

05:58.892 --> 05:59.958
>> Just put it in.

05:59.960 --> 06:00.959
>> Fine. Hey, listen.

06:00.961 --> 06:02.961
This is what I'll do.

06:02.963 --> 06:04.696
"Ladies are now mandatory.

06:04.698 --> 06:07.165
"Each of you dick bags must

06:07.167 --> 06:08.333
recruit at least one woman."

06:08.335 --> 06:09.534
Should we put anything else?

06:09.536 --> 06:10.736
>> Make 'em eat a shit sandwich.

06:10.738 --> 06:11.970
>> What is it with you and the

06:11.972 --> 06:13.205
shit sandwich?

06:13.207 --> 06:14.339
Do you really want to see

06:14.341 --> 06:15.540
somebody take a roll and stick

06:15.542 --> 06:16.742
doody in it, and then they put

06:16.744 --> 06:17.976
it in their mouth?

06:17.978 --> 06:19.177
God, you are so gross.

06:19.179 --> 06:21.380
>> Eh...

06:21.382 --> 06:22.381
>> Okay, so, how much for the

06:22.383 --> 06:23.548
Wolf Colas?

06:23.550 --> 06:24.583
>> Five bucks a piece.

06:24.585 --> 06:25.751
>> Okay, great.

06:25.753 --> 06:27.018
Ma, how many you want?

06:27.020 --> 06:28.186
>> I'll take three.

06:28.188 --> 06:29.354
>> Okay. And Mrs. Mac?

06:29.356 --> 06:30.522
(coughs)

06:30.524 --> 06:31.757
>> She'll have one.

06:31.759 --> 06:33.925
>> Huh?
>> One. Any more caffeine than

06:33.927 --> 06:36.061
that, and she will not stop
talking.

06:36.063 --> 06:37.095
>> Really? Oh, kind of want to

06:37.097 --> 06:38.196
see that.

06:38.198 --> 06:39.231
>> Hey, Charlie, can I talk to

06:39.233 --> 06:40.399
you for a second?

06:40.401 --> 06:41.533
>> Yeah. What's up?

06:41.535 --> 06:42.534
>> Um, does all this seem kind

06:42.536 --> 06:43.602
of strange to you?

06:43.604 --> 06:44.603
>> Huh? Uh, oh, you mean the

06:44.605 --> 06:45.604
Wolf Cola thing?

06:45.606 --> 06:47.072
Yeah. I was wondering.

06:47.074 --> 06:49.274
Like, how does the Master know
about Wolf Cola?

06:49.276 --> 06:51.443
>> Oh, he's an aficionado of
all beverages.

06:51.445 --> 06:53.712
He's gonna know the finest of

13:18.965 --> 13:19.964
>> Yeah, how's-how's the neck

13:19.966 --> 13:21.332
feeling? How's the neck?

13:21.334 --> 13:22.834
>> You know, it's not bad.

13:22.836 --> 13:24.102
It's actually a little tight.

13:24.104 --> 13:25.503
>> It's a little tight.

13:25.505 --> 13:27.672
Well, how about if we hop in the
healing pool...

13:27.674 --> 13:29.674
>> Okay.
>> ...and I'll give you some

13:29.676 --> 13:30.675
touch therapy, so you don't seem

13:30.677 --> 13:31.910
too weak for the Master.

13:31.912 --> 13:33.578
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah.

13:33.580 --> 13:35.246
>> I don't suppose that could
hurt.

13:35.248 --> 13:36.181
>> No, that won't hurt.

13:36.183 --> 13:37.782
(meditative music playing)

13:37.784 --> 13:38.817
(Frank chuckles)

13:38.819 --> 13:40.351
>> Oh, shit.

13:40.353 --> 13:42.187
>> Oh, hi.

13:42.189 --> 13:44.489
The water's wonderful.

13:44.491 --> 13:45.657
>> When did you get in here?

13:45.659 --> 13:46.658
>> Oh, you don't mind that we

13:46.660 --> 13:47.826
came in first, do you?

13:47.828 --> 13:49.127
There's plenty of room.

13:49.129 --> 13:50.695
>> No, how long are you gonna
be?

13:50.697 --> 13:51.696
>> Well...

13:51.698 --> 13:52.997
>> (groans) Oh, man...

13:52.999 --> 13:54.265
>> She thinks she has a tear

13:54.267 --> 13:56.801
in her uterine wall, so it

13:56.803 --> 13:59.270
might be a while.
>> All right.

13:59.272 --> 14:02.941
Let's-let's go... (muttering)

14:02.943 --> 14:04.843
>> I'm gonna go do a few more
sets of KettlePops while, uh,

14:04.845 --> 14:06.511
running the block a few times.
>> Yeah, nice.

14:06.513 --> 14:08.813
>> Don't want to disappoint the
Master. >> Mm-hmm.

14:08.815 --> 14:10.348
>> You want to come?
>> Go, you go get yourself good

14:10.350 --> 14:12.116
and banged up.
>> Okay.

14:12.118 --> 14:14.052
>> Oh, yeah...
>> Guys, guys, guys, there's

14:14.054 --> 14:15.687
been a mistake, a terrible
mistake.

14:15.689 --> 14:17.689
I got a new newsletter from the
Master.

14:17.691 --> 14:18.890
There's gonna be no more women,

14:18.892 --> 14:20.024
no more Wolf Cola and no more

14:20.026 --> 14:22.293
carpentry in Ass Kickers United.

14:22.295 --> 14:23.328
This has all been a test

14:23.330 --> 14:24.729
designed by the Master to figure

14:24.731 --> 14:26.631
out who the true believers are.

14:26.633 --> 14:28.066
I passed, you failed and that's

14:28.068 --> 14:29.567
why I'm going to level two.

14:29.569 --> 14:31.569
(Dennis grunting)
Oh, also, uh, Dennis will be

14:31.571 --> 14:33.571
level two as well, but he'll be
directly under me.

14:33.573 --> 14:35.640
>> Wh-What?
Where'd you get that from?

14:35.642 --> 14:37.575
>> Uh, it was implied in the
newsletter.

14:37.577 --> 14:40.578
>> No. >> Well, how is
Dennis in level two?

14:40.580 --> 14:42.580
Or an Ass Kicker,
for that matter?

14:42.582 --> 14:43.648
>> Oh, he bought in.

14:43.650 --> 14:44.582
>> He... bought in?

14:44.584 --> 14:45.583
>> Come on, Ass Kickers, let's

14:45.585 --> 14:46.584
get out of here before we're

14:46.586 --> 14:48.586
tainted by these disgusting
women.

14:48.588 --> 14:49.587
>> All right. Crazy.

14:49.589 --> 14:50.588
>> Cool!

14:50.590 --> 14:52.657
>> Failed that test.

14:52.659 --> 14:54.392
>> Go kick some ass, huh?

14:54.394 --> 14:55.526
Go kick some ass!

14:55.528 --> 14:56.694
(chuckles)

14:56.696 --> 14:57.996
(Frank grumbles)

14:57.998 --> 14:59.063
Thought you could outmaster the

14:59.065 --> 15:00.064
Master, idiots?

15:00.066 --> 15:01.099
>> So you swayed 'em back.

15:01.101 --> 15:02.066
Uh, whatever.

15:02.068 --> 15:03.101
We can do that, too.

15:03.103 --> 15:04.102
>> Dee, you think this is easy?

15:04.104 --> 15:05.603
You need years of practice to

15:05.605 --> 15:08.406
even sniff my talent for
manipulation.

15:08.408 --> 15:09.440
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have

15:09.442 --> 15:11.776
a cult that needs a charismatic
leader.

15:11.778 --> 15:14.779
(chuckles)

15:14.781 --> 15:16.681
Yeah.

15:16.683 --> 15:18.349
>> Goddamn it, Frank.

15:18.351 --> 15:19.751
Goddamn it! No.

15:19.753 --> 15:20.852
No, we cannot let him get away

15:20.854 --> 15:21.886
with this.

15:21.888 --> 15:22.887
No, this is about something

15:22.889 --> 15:23.888
different now, something much

15:23.890 --> 15:25.056
more important.

15:25.058 --> 15:26.090
>> Shit sandwich?

15:26.092 --> 15:27.792
>> What? Why? What is that?

15:27.794 --> 15:28.960
No. God.

15:28.962 --> 15:31.129
No, this is about control now.

15:31.131 --> 15:32.230
This is about control and it's

15:32.232 --> 15:34.232
about beating Dennis.

15:34.234 --> 15:38.770
I know exactly what we need to
do.

15:38.772 --> 15:41.205
(snoring)

15:46.313 --> 15:48.313
>> (quietly): Deandra, we're all
set.

15:48.315 --> 15:49.314
>> Yeah?

15:49.316 --> 15:50.315
>> Yeah.

15:50.317 --> 15:51.316
>> He's out?

15:51.318 --> 15:52.383
>> He's lit.

15:52.385 --> 15:53.618
I have so much alcohol, and I

15:53.620 --> 15:55.787
gave him three bottles of Fight
Milk.

15:55.789 --> 15:56.988
>> Whoa. That's a lot.

15:56.990 --> 15:58.456
Okay, you ready? Got your cards?

15:58.458 --> 15:59.424
Okay.

15:59.426 --> 16:02.460
>> Okay. Here we go.

16:02.462 --> 16:05.263
>> (eerily): Charlie.

16:05.265 --> 16:07.498
Charlie.

16:07.500 --> 16:08.766
>> Say it louder.

16:08.768 --> 16:09.968
>> Charlie, wake up!

16:09.970 --> 16:11.002
>> Huh?

16:11.004 --> 16:14.005
What's... what's...

16:14.007 --> 16:15.273
What's happening?

16:15.275 --> 16:19.644
>> It is I... the Master!

16:19.646 --> 16:20.912
>> Am I dreaming?

16:20.914 --> 16:22.847
>> You're having a vision.

16:22.849 --> 16:24.315
>> Am I peeing?

16:24.317 --> 16:26.417
>> Uh...
(whispering): Is he peeing?

16:26.419 --> 16:28.152
>> Just read the card.

16:28.154 --> 16:30.588
>> You and the other Ass Kickers

16:30.590 --> 16:33.825
must con... con...

16:33.827 --> 16:35.827
What's that word?
>> Congregate.

16:35.829 --> 16:37.295
>> Congregate?
What does that mean?

16:37.297 --> 16:39.130
>> It doesn't matter.
Just say it.

16:39.132 --> 16:40.665
>> Congregate.

16:40.667 --> 16:41.666
>> What does that mean?

16:41.668 --> 16:42.633
>> Oh, God.

16:42.635 --> 16:43.801
You know what? Just...

16:43.803 --> 16:45.003
Hey, Charlie, hey.

16:45.005 --> 16:46.537
Get all the Ass Kickers together

16:46.539 --> 16:47.638
and meet at Mac and Dennis's

16:47.640 --> 16:48.806
apartment, okay?

16:48.808 --> 16:49.974
Lord Zolo is gonna get you on

16:49.976 --> 16:51.175
the mother ship.

16:51.177 --> 16:52.777
>> Lord Zolo?

16:52.779 --> 16:54.445
>> Charlie... you've graduated

16:54.447 --> 16:55.480
to the next level.

16:55.482 --> 16:56.614
Congratulations.

16:56.616 --> 16:58.049
And your reward is to get to

16:58.051 --> 17:00.118
know all the secrets of the
universe.

17:03.690 --> 17:04.822
>> Yeah, there's just a few

17:04.824 --> 17:06.157
things you have to do.

17:06.159 --> 17:07.191
>> Okay.

17:07.193 --> 17:08.860
I'll do them.

17:08.862 --> 17:10.061
I'm peeing.
>> Uh-oh.

17:10.063 --> 17:12.130
>> Oh...

17:17.537 --> 17:18.970
>> Okay, you guys, ready...

17:18.972 --> 17:20.872
Holy shit!

17:20.874 --> 17:22.740
>> Whoa! What the hell happened
in here?

17:22.742 --> 17:24.976
>> Hey, do you like it?
Yeah, well, before Master Rex

17:24.978 --> 17:27.378
said that we weren't supposed to
do carpentry, I talked to Tiny

17:27.380 --> 17:28.980
and Jojo and they got their
construction crew in here.

17:28.982 --> 17:30.581
>> There's a wall.

17:30.583 --> 17:32.583
>> Oh, you're goddamn right
there's a wall.

17:32.585 --> 17:34.585
I'm good.
Dennis is gonna shit his pants.

17:34.587 --> 17:36.487
>> Yeah... why?
What are you good at?

17:36.489 --> 17:37.722
>> Good at my... I'm a good

17:37.724 --> 17:39.090
person, and you know what?

17:39.092 --> 17:40.925
It's time to... to do the plan

17:40.927 --> 17:42.593
that the Master laid out, right?

17:42.595 --> 17:44.228
>> I'm gonna take Tiny in the

17:44.230 --> 17:46.164
other room and make the pods
ready. Come on, Tiny.

17:46.166 --> 17:47.932
>> You're so lucky.
>> Oh, we got pods?

17:47.934 --> 17:49.700
>> Yeah.
>> Of course we got pods.

17:49.702 --> 17:50.735
Lord Zolo's gonna take you guys

17:50.737 --> 17:51.736
on that mother ship with him,

17:51.738 --> 17:52.770
you need pods.

17:52.772 --> 17:53.871
Am I right, Master?

17:53.873 --> 17:55.106
>> Do-Do I get a pod?

17:55.108 --> 17:56.174
>> Okay, guys, guys, guys...

17:56.176 --> 17:59.277
We got a... wow.
Holy shit.

17:59.279 --> 18:00.378
>> That's a wall.

18:00.380 --> 18:02.013
>> Yeah.
This place looks great.

18:02.015 --> 18:03.581
>> You're goddamn right this
place looks great.

18:03.583 --> 18:04.615
>> Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's pretty

18:04.617 --> 18:05.850
impressive stuff, Dee, but,

18:05.852 --> 18:07.618
uh... it doesn't seal the deal.

18:07.620 --> 18:09.253
Guys, I've got an announcement
to make.

18:09.255 --> 18:10.788
Yeah, we've got some big news
here.

18:10.790 --> 18:11.756
The Master texted me while we

18:11.758 --> 18:12.857
were on our way over here.

18:12.859 --> 18:14.258
>> Oh, interesting.

18:14.260 --> 18:15.726
Uh, I wonder how it's possible

18:15.728 --> 18:16.894
that the Master could've texted

18:16.896 --> 18:18.196
you when he's been here with us

18:18.198 --> 18:19.630
the whole time.

18:19.632 --> 18:20.698
>> Rex is the Master?

18:20.700 --> 18:22.200
That makes so much sense.

18:22.202 --> 18:23.301
>> Yep. Yes.

18:23.303 --> 18:24.402
>> Oh, my...

18:24.404 --> 18:25.470
>> Of course I know that Rex is

18:25.472 --> 18:26.437
the Master, and of course I

18:26.439 --> 18:27.805
would never question the word of

18:27.807 --> 18:29.640
someone so... wise.

18:29.642 --> 18:31.609
But I actually got a text from

18:31.611 --> 18:33.611
the Supreme Overlord Master.

18:33.613 --> 18:34.645
And that's Rex's master.

18:34.647 --> 18:35.980
>> Oh, shit.

18:35.982 --> 18:37.315
>> "Oh, shit," is right, you
guys.

18:37.317 --> 18:38.549
That's the... he's the big guy.

18:38.551 --> 18:39.584
He sits right at the

18:39.586 --> 18:40.785
tippy-tippy-top, and he made it

18:40.787 --> 18:43.121
very, very clear to me that all

18:43.123 --> 18:45.990
of you are going to need to...

18:45.992 --> 18:47.725
commit suicide.

18:47.727 --> 18:50.228
>> Tits! I knew it!
The final circle.

18:50.230 --> 18:51.829
>> Yeah, okay, sure, but hang on
a second.

18:51.831 --> 18:53.564
Can I please talk to you for
just a quick second?

18:53.566 --> 18:55.466
>> Sure, sure, sure.
Now, why don't you guys get

18:55.468 --> 18:57.135
yourselves all lathered up in
lighter fluid and, uh, you're

18:57.137 --> 18:58.469
gonna get ready to light
yourselves ablaze.

18:58.471 --> 19:00.071
>> Thank you, thank you!
>> All right.

19:00.073 --> 19:01.672
>> Thanks for trusting me.
>> Yeah, of course.

19:01.674 --> 19:02.907
>> I did it. I won.

19:02.909 --> 19:05.676
I am the most charismatic
leader.

19:05.678 --> 19:07.645
I got Tiny to eat a shit
sandwich.

19:07.647 --> 19:08.779
>> Ugh!

19:08.781 --> 19:10.581
>> Oh! Goddamn it!
(sputters)

19:10.583 --> 19:12.683
>> I got him to eat a poopy.

19:12.685 --> 19:14.085
>> You idiot!

19:14.087 --> 19:15.086
I got these guys to think they

19:15.088 --> 19:16.454
were going to another dimension.

19:16.456 --> 19:17.421
I'm the winner.

19:17.423 --> 19:18.422
>> Are you kidding me?

19:18.424 --> 19:19.457
They were gonna light themselves

19:19.459 --> 19:20.424
on fire for me.

19:20.426 --> 19:21.692
I'm the winner.
>> Oh...

19:21.694 --> 19:22.760
>> Guys, guys, hang on a second.

19:22.762 --> 19:24.295
The winner of what?

19:24.297 --> 19:26.330
>> The... the Ass Kickers, okay?

19:26.332 --> 19:27.598
The winner of the Ass Kickers.

19:27.600 --> 19:28.966
It-it's mine, it's not theirs.

19:28.968 --> 19:30.168
>> What?

19:30.170 --> 19:31.269
>> It's mine, it's... the whole

19:31.271 --> 19:33.337
thing's made up, I made it up.

19:33.339 --> 19:34.972
>> Master Rex, is this true?

19:34.974 --> 19:36.641
>> Oh, don't ask Rex. What...?

19:36.643 --> 19:38.142
>> The fire is started.

19:38.144 --> 19:39.977
Thank you so much for trusting
me with this.

19:39.979 --> 19:41.812
This is good-bye!
>> No... goddamn it, no!

19:41.814 --> 19:43.347
>> No, man, don't do it!
>> Oh!

19:43.349 --> 19:44.849
(Jojo screams)
>> Run!

19:44.851 --> 19:46.317
>> Hey! We'll get you some
help, okay?

19:46.319 --> 19:47.552
We'll call the fire department.
>> Yeah.

19:47.554 --> 19:49.287
>> Oh, God.
>> Yeah.

19:49.289 --> 19:50.988
>> And then we'll go to Dee's.
>> Yeah, right?

19:50.990 --> 19:53.224
>> No, no, can't we go anywhere
else? >> No, Dee.

19:53.226 --> 19:55.459
>> What if the Supreme Overlord
