WEBVTT

00:00.444 --> 00:02.578
Our new guidance counselor,
Tami Taylor.

00:03.113 --> 00:05.148
- 46 absences last year.
- Yeah.

00:05.182 --> 00:08.051
These kids are just
being forgotten.

00:08.085 --> 00:09.485
I want this job real bad.

00:09.520 --> 00:10.920
I think it would be
really good for me

00:10.954 --> 00:13.890
to be around somebody
like you right now.

00:13.924 --> 00:15.625
Oh, my!

00:15.659 --> 00:18.428
Luke Cafferty just laid him
flat out.

00:18.462 --> 00:20.997
You are going to college.
That's a big deal.

00:21.031 --> 00:22.432
Bye, guys.

00:24.635 --> 00:25.868
My mom's out of town.

00:25.903 --> 00:27.670
I've been staying with my dad
and my stepmom,

00:27.704 --> 00:29.105
and I just...
I can't do it anymore.

00:29.139 --> 00:30.506
I need a place to stay.

00:30.541 --> 00:33.709
Cafferty...Oh!

00:33.744 --> 00:34.911
Lions win!

00:34.945 --> 00:37.046
Oh, the humanity!

00:40.317 --> 00:44.620
No one can deny that the Whataburger
classic was an eye-opener

00:44.655 --> 00:46.155
and that the Lions
showed some stuff

00:46.190 --> 00:49.425
that the world better sit up
and pay attention to.

00:49.460 --> 00:51.561
The eyes of Texas
will be on the teams

00:51.595 --> 00:52.995
that get ranked this year.

00:53.030 --> 00:54.997
Maybe things
are about to change

00:55.032 --> 00:58.034
for a little school
called East Dillon.

00:58.068 --> 00:59.869
<i>Dallas star.
Dallas star, man.</i>

00:59.903 --> 01:04.706
All right, it says, "the East
Dillon Lions shocked the world."

01:04.741 --> 01:07.043
I mean, that's awesome...
"shocked the world."

01:07.077 --> 01:08.778
You think
we're gonna get ranked?

01:08.812 --> 01:10.279
Oh, we got to get ranked.
Are you kidding me?

01:10.314 --> 01:11.948
We beat one of the top teams
in the state.

01:11.982 --> 01:13.950
Coach.
Coach.

01:13.984 --> 01:15.451
We're totally
gonna get ranked, right?

01:15.486 --> 01:16.519
Oh, oh, Crowley, look, man.

01:16.553 --> 01:18.554
There's a picture of you
in here too.

01:18.589 --> 01:20.323
And I got a quote.

01:20.357 --> 01:22.792
"East Dillon Lions are hungry
to feed on you.

01:22.826 --> 01:26.162
You can run,
but you cannot hide."

01:26.196 --> 01:28.464
You chalk the field yet?

01:30.000 --> 01:36.074

01:50.854 --> 01:53.322
Oh! Oh! Oh!

01:57.794 --> 01:59.795
Number 35!

02:07.571 --> 02:10.539
- Oh!
- Oh!

02:19.550 --> 02:23.286
I'm so sorry, but, uh...
My girlfriend is right over there,

02:23.320 --> 02:25.655
and I can't give you my jersey.
I'm sorry.

02:40.204 --> 02:43.172
Oh, all right.

02:43.207 --> 02:44.440
Oh.

02:44.474 --> 02:47.610
Oh, yeah.

02:47.644 --> 02:51.047
Come on!

02:51.081 --> 02:52.148
Who's it gonna be?

02:52.182 --> 02:54.850
Wide receiver?
Tight end?

02:54.885 --> 02:55.918
Oh!

02:59.223 --> 03:00.990
She's mine she's mine!

03:01.758 --> 03:03.793
She's mine, y'all.

03:03.827 --> 03:05.561
All right, who's next?

03:05.596 --> 03:06.562
Who's next?

03:06.597 --> 03:08.097
Come on!
Come on!

03:08.131 --> 03:09.232
Who's next?

03:19.276 --> 03:20.843
Hey.

03:24.381 --> 03:27.149
Are you Epyck?

03:27.184 --> 03:29.719
Yeah.

03:31.321 --> 03:33.756
You know there's no smoking
on school property, right?

03:33.790 --> 03:35.891
Everybody in Texas smokes.

03:35.926 --> 03:37.460
Babies smoke in this state.

03:37.494 --> 03:41.297
Well, even babies can't smoke
on school property.

03:41.331 --> 03:43.966
You need to be in class
right now.

03:44.001 --> 03:45.801
- I didn't eat yet.
- Oh.

03:45.836 --> 03:47.637
Can't think without eating.

03:47.671 --> 03:50.640
Well, you need to eat
before you come to class.

03:50.674 --> 03:51.941
You also need to come

03:51.975 --> 03:54.477
to your scheduled
guidance-counselor meetings.

03:54.511 --> 03:56.412
Mom said I didn't have to.

03:56.446 --> 03:59.148
Well, you do.

03:59.182 --> 04:01.050
My name's Tami Taylor.

04:01.084 --> 04:03.486
I'm the new guidance counselor
this year.

04:03.520 --> 04:05.988
And we're gonna be working
on your grades

04:06.023 --> 04:08.758
and making sure you go to class

04:08.792 --> 04:11.127
and making sure you're not
smoking on school property.

04:12.863 --> 04:14.530
Okay.

04:16.533 --> 04:19.101
Class is this way, Epyck.

04:22.539 --> 04:25.207
Hey, number 5, come here!

04:29.379 --> 04:31.580
What's up?

04:31.615 --> 04:34.583
Sit down.
What day is it today?

04:34.618 --> 04:36.585
- Tuesday?
- September 1st.

04:36.620 --> 04:38.587
It's the first day
of the NCAA contact period

04:38.622 --> 04:40.690
- for junior athletes.
- Cool.

04:40.724 --> 04:48.230
Georgia, university of Texas, 
Alabama, S.C.... Those are yours.

04:50.233 --> 04:52.768
- Those are for me?
- Well, they're not for me.

04:52.803 --> 04:54.236
They're letters of intent...

04:54.271 --> 04:57.907
Letters from universities
that have interest in you.

05:02.012 --> 05:04.847
- Don't open them now.
- No?

05:04.881 --> 05:06.215
Take them home
and open them up.

05:06.249 --> 05:08.451
- Oh, okay.
- Go on, take all this stuff.

05:08.485 --> 05:11.020
Get it off my desk.
You're cluttering it up.

05:11.054 --> 05:12.655
All right.

05:12.689 --> 05:13.989
Hey.

05:14.024 --> 05:16.125
That's pretty cool, huh?

05:16.159 --> 05:17.993
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

05:18.028 --> 05:19.795
Damn cool.

05:21.331 --> 05:23.666
Thanks, coach.

05:30.273 --> 05:40.280
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

06:19.589 --> 06:22.457
Let's go.
Off the ball.

06:22.492 --> 06:24.159
Wrap him up high.

06:24.193 --> 06:26.295
Wrap him up!
Here we go now!

06:26.329 --> 06:28.964
Go.
What you gonna do? Oh!

06:28.998 --> 06:30.132
That's it.

06:30.166 --> 06:31.333
Hustle!

06:31.367 --> 06:32.768
Run through it now.
Run through it.

06:32.802 --> 06:34.069
Let's go!

06:34.103 --> 06:35.537
Get off the ball, Sutherton!
Let's go!

06:35.571 --> 06:38.507
- Come on now, 98!
- Come on, get him!

06:38.541 --> 06:40.342
Attack the hole, baby!

06:40.376 --> 06:42.911
I know this year...
I know this year we'll be ranked.

06:42.946 --> 06:44.713
Hey, Luke, man.

06:44.747 --> 06:46.748
I heard one of those guys say
we're gonna be ranked top 20.

06:46.783 --> 06:48.951
After our last game,
I think we're gonna be

06:48.985 --> 06:49.985
ranked top 10 after this.

06:50.019 --> 06:51.353
Hell, yeah.
Hell, yes.

06:51.387 --> 06:53.155
I don't hear that crap
talked about out here anymore.

06:53.189 --> 06:54.156
Do you understand me?

06:54.190 --> 06:55.357
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

06:55.391 --> 06:57.092
Keep your mind focused
on what's going on.

06:57.126 --> 06:59.528
- You got it?
- Yes, sir.

06:59.562 --> 07:02.364
Let's go, Tinker.
Fire off the ball.

07:02.398 --> 07:04.266
Hastings, you got to stop
dancing on your route, son.

07:04.300 --> 07:06.001
You got to break on it.
You hear me?

07:06.035 --> 07:07.569
You break on the ball,
all right?

07:07.603 --> 07:09.705
What the hell are you doing?

07:09.739 --> 07:10.906
What the hell are you doing?

07:10.940 --> 07:12.607
I'm just taking a-a break.

07:12.642 --> 07:13.809
- What?
- Come on, Tinker!

07:13.843 --> 07:16.478
Relax, Billy. I'm just...
Do you have any protein on you?

07:16.512 --> 07:18.280
You call me coach Riggins,
or you call me sir.

07:18.314 --> 07:20.582
Do you hear me?
Put that damn helmet on.

07:20.616 --> 07:22.384
- Put the helmet on!
- All right.

07:22.418 --> 07:23.385
- Now!
- All right, all right.

07:23.419 --> 07:25.053
Do it again!
Let's go!

07:26.923 --> 07:28.590
Hey, coach.

07:28.624 --> 07:33.061
Sir, this kid's
a piece of work.

07:33.096 --> 07:35.063
Be easy on him.

07:35.098 --> 07:38.166
Yes, sir.

07:38.201 --> 07:42.838
Don't take your helmet off
on my field again.

07:42.872 --> 07:44.406
Let's go!

07:44.440 --> 07:46.942
Rankings, that's all they're
damn talking about out here.

07:46.976 --> 07:48.276
Oh, don't worry
about it, coach.

07:48.311 --> 07:49.978
We'll get their mind right.

07:50.013 --> 07:51.747
Are you worried about it?

07:51.781 --> 07:53.715
Do I look worried
about anything?

07:53.750 --> 07:55.384
I didn't think so.

07:59.055 --> 08:00.389
Aw, cookies.

08:00.423 --> 08:01.523
Oh, yeah.

08:01.557 --> 08:03.925
Rice krispie treats.

08:03.960 --> 08:06.261
I mean, these are, like,
the best.

08:06.295 --> 08:08.530
It's like two cookies stuck
together with peanut butter.

08:08.564 --> 08:10.165
Oh.

08:10.199 --> 08:12.200
Oh, my God, are you serious?
Are you serious?

08:12.235 --> 08:13.602
- Oh, man.
- Hey, guys.

08:13.636 --> 08:18.607
Uh, I got porn...
Lots of porn.

08:22.111 --> 08:23.612
All right.

08:23.646 --> 08:26.815
- Okay, I'll see you out there.
- All right, cool.

08:35.158 --> 08:37.392
- Hey, baby girl.
- Hey, baby.

08:37.427 --> 08:38.527
How you doing?

08:38.561 --> 08:40.028
- Good.
- Good?

08:40.063 --> 08:42.764
Did you, um, forget
the combination to my locker?

08:42.799 --> 08:45.300
Mm-mm.
I still remember it. Why?

08:45.334 --> 08:48.236
Mm, okay, well, just that
all the other players

08:48.271 --> 08:49.905
got something
from the rally girls...

08:49.939 --> 08:53.442
cookies, brownies, porn,
and stuff...

08:53.476 --> 08:56.344
and I just didn't see nothing
in my locker, so, you know,

08:56.379 --> 08:57.946
my baby must have forgot.

08:57.980 --> 08:59.181
Oh, yeah.

08:59.215 --> 09:00.549
About that, though.

09:00.583 --> 09:01.883
You know what?

09:01.918 --> 09:04.619
I don't really think
this rally-girl thing is for me.

09:04.654 --> 09:06.455
Okay.

09:06.489 --> 09:09.591
I mean, if that's
the way you feel, cool.

09:09.625 --> 09:11.626
And I'm just saying
that's how I think, you know.

09:11.661 --> 09:13.462
I know some other people
don't think that way,

09:13.496 --> 09:15.230
and that's cool too.

09:15.264 --> 09:18.233
And... and I'm not saying you
shouldn't have a rally girl.

09:18.267 --> 09:21.236
Jess, you would have a fit
if you seen another girl

09:21.270 --> 09:22.737
walking around the school
wearing my jersey.

09:22.772 --> 09:25.040
Boy, it's just a jersey.

09:25.074 --> 09:26.942
Why would
I actually have a fit?

09:26.976 --> 09:29.411
You telling me
I can go get a rally girl?

09:29.445 --> 09:31.546
Boy, go get yourself
a rally girl.

09:31.581 --> 09:32.714
All right, all right.

09:32.748 --> 09:34.983
- Thank you.
- Go on, now.

09:35.017 --> 09:37.252
Okay, all right.
Thank you.

09:37.286 --> 09:38.920
Well...

09:41.390 --> 09:46.194
So what I'm suggesting is an
after-school tutorial program...

09:46.195 --> 09:51.133
Maybe one day a week, and a
few teachers a week pitch in.

09:51.167 --> 09:55.137
The... the idea would be to give
some of these at-risk kids

09:55.171 --> 09:57.706
an opportunity
to improve, you know.

09:57.740 --> 09:59.241
They're not getting the help
at home.

09:59.275 --> 10:01.042
Let's give them a place
where they can come

10:01.077 --> 10:03.678
and do better in their studies.

10:03.713 --> 10:06.114
Tami, the thing is,
is that we are already,

10:06.149 --> 10:07.983
all of us, giving so much,

10:08.017 --> 10:10.218
and we basically get paid
nothing to do it.

10:10.253 --> 10:14.289
And we already know which kids
want help and which ones don't.

10:14.323 --> 10:16.391
Well, I-I hear what you're saying.

10:16.425 --> 10:18.260
You know, I don't know,
for me, as an educator,

10:18.294 --> 10:21.696
the challenge is getting to those
kids who are harder to reach.

10:21.731 --> 10:22.998
That's what I really love.

10:23.032 --> 10:24.366
You're right.

10:24.400 --> 10:26.168
But I just don't want it
to take away from my other kids.

10:26.202 --> 10:28.570
I think we're saying
the same thing,

10:28.604 --> 10:30.705
and I'll... I'll put up
a sign-up, and, you know,

10:30.740 --> 10:33.208
people who are willing
to volunteer, it would be great.

10:33.242 --> 10:34.309
Let's just see what happens.

10:34.343 --> 10:35.777
Good.
Well, thank you, Tami.

10:35.811 --> 10:38.013
Thank you so much.
Um...

10:38.047 --> 10:40.015
You know, we have
some other things to cover.

10:40.049 --> 10:44.719
We need to talk about supervising
the parking lot for lunch.

10:44.754 --> 10:46.688
Most historians believe

10:46.722 --> 10:52.427
that there were around
250 defenders of the Alamo.

10:52.461 --> 10:57.499
Not a soul who fought
at the battle of the Alamo

10:57.533 --> 11:01.203
was left to tell the story.

11:01.237 --> 11:03.772
In section this week,

11:03.806 --> 11:07.676
be ready to discuss
Davy Crockett and the Alamo

11:07.710 --> 11:13.882
as an example of myth versus
history in the American south.

11:15.451 --> 11:18.887
Hey, guys.
I'm Derek Bishop, head T.A.

11:18.921 --> 11:21.156
Look, the "deets"
are on the syllabi.

11:21.190 --> 11:22.424
Professor Nevins is holding

11:22.458 --> 11:24.993
his annual history department
mixer tomorrow.

11:25.027 --> 11:27.395
Even if you're not considering
history as your major,

11:27.430 --> 11:28.830
I recommend showing up,

11:28.864 --> 11:31.633
unless you know a better place
to eat free food

11:31.667 --> 11:33.401
and dodge old men
with halitosis.

11:33.436 --> 11:34.769
I'm just kidding.

11:34.804 --> 11:35.904
Professor Nevins
isn't that old.

11:35.938 --> 11:38.039
Anyway, rally
your study groups, okay?

11:38.074 --> 11:39.074
Let's come out.

11:39.108 --> 11:40.408
Thank you.
You're done.

11:58.594 --> 12:00.629
Hey, excuse me.

12:00.663 --> 12:02.464
Um, I was wondering,
do you have a study group?

12:02.498 --> 12:06.334
Oh, hey, uh...
Actually, I'm just pledging sigma chi.

12:06.369 --> 12:09.137
The brothers are making me
take notes for them.

12:09.171 --> 12:15.777
I'm not even in this class, but...
Oh, okay, thanks.

12:21.484 --> 12:24.552
Ladies, I'm home.

12:24.587 --> 12:25.887
Hey.
Sorry about the mess.

12:25.921 --> 12:28.156
Um, I'm trying to double
this oatmeal-cookie recipe

12:28.190 --> 12:31.026
for Tinker, and I don't think
I did it right,

12:31.060 --> 12:32.994
'cause that looks like a brick.

12:33.029 --> 12:34.729
Did you put all the flour
in there and everything?

12:34.764 --> 12:38.566
Yeah, I did that, and then, um...
I added four...

12:38.601 --> 12:39.901
You got to double the eggs.

12:39.935 --> 12:42.137
You got to double, like,
all the liquid that's in it too.

12:42.171 --> 12:43.371
So, like, more milk?

12:43.406 --> 12:46.074
Yeah, more milk, more eggs,
'cause if you double the flour,

12:46.108 --> 12:47.475
then you have to double
all the liquids.

12:47.510 --> 12:49.077
You can't just double up
the flour.

12:49.111 --> 12:51.313
Well, if it's, like, 1 3/4...

12:51.347 --> 12:53.281
Hey, baby, can I see you
outside for a minute?

12:53.316 --> 12:54.616
Um, yeah, all right.

12:54.650 --> 12:56.618
- Hey, Min, want some cookies?
- I really don't.

12:56.652 --> 12:59.020
We'll figure this out.
We'll get it figured out.

12:59.055 --> 13:00.455
What's up?

13:00.489 --> 13:02.357
So, I'm just gonna go
and say this now.

13:02.391 --> 13:03.425
I don't like it.

13:03.459 --> 13:04.693
Oh, she'll clean it up.

13:04.727 --> 13:07.429
I mean, it's not...
Yeah, I'm not worried about the kitchen.

13:07.463 --> 13:08.863
I'm worried about her
being all cute

13:08.898 --> 13:10.932
and you being all, "did you put
enough milk in the recipe?"

13:10.966 --> 13:12.334
<i>I read US Magazine.</i>

13:12.368 --> 13:14.636
That nanny with John and Kate...
Look what happened to them.

13:14.670 --> 13:16.604
Babe, she's not a nanny.
She's just...

13:16.639 --> 13:18.139
It's not about being a nanny!

13:18.174 --> 13:19.974
It's about her
wearing her short shorts

13:20.009 --> 13:21.643
and being all cute
in my house all the time.

13:21.677 --> 13:24.045
It's bigger than you,
and it's nature,

13:24.080 --> 13:26.781
and there's a fox in my
henhouse, and I don't like it.

13:26.816 --> 13:29.284
Baby, my brother,
who is in prison because of me,

13:29.318 --> 13:32.220
asked me to look after her,
all right?

13:45.134 --> 13:46.835
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, mama.

13:46.869 --> 13:48.970
- What are you doing awake?
- Waiting for you to come home.

13:49.004 --> 13:50.205
I got some stuff
I got to show you.

13:50.239 --> 13:52.841
Oh, baby, not tonight.
I am so tired.

13:52.875 --> 13:54.809
- It'll just take a second.
- My boss was on me.

13:54.844 --> 13:57.379
He was talking about the department
not being zoned properly.

13:57.413 --> 13:58.913
Then the next thing you know,
he sends me over there

13:58.948 --> 14:00.248
to relieve some people.

14:00.282 --> 14:01.983
I go and relieve them,
then later on tonight,

14:02.017 --> 14:04.219
he tells me I'm not doing
my job properly.

14:04.253 --> 14:05.353
Can you believe that?

14:05.388 --> 14:06.955
It's too much.
It just wore me out.

14:06.989 --> 14:08.656
But we'll be all right.

14:08.691 --> 14:09.724
Mm-hmm.

14:09.759 --> 14:12.227
- Really?
- Yeah.

14:14.563 --> 14:15.830
What's this?

14:15.865 --> 14:23.271
These are letters... From colleges...
Miami, Michigan, l.S.U.,

14:23.305 --> 14:26.875
Texas, Ohio state, Alabama.

14:26.909 --> 14:28.843
Mama, they want me.

14:28.878 --> 14:31.646
Where do you want to live?
You want the city, the beach?

14:31.680 --> 14:34.282
Florida?
California?

14:34.316 --> 14:35.850
Huh? Where... where do you
want to live?

14:35.885 --> 14:37.619
Girl, I'm gonna
take care of you, mama.

14:37.653 --> 14:39.954
I'm so proud of you, baby.

14:39.989 --> 14:41.556
You don't have to worry
about nothing anymore.

14:41.590 --> 14:42.991
- I promise.
- I'm so proud of you.

14:53.636 --> 14:56.638
Good morning.
How are my two favorite people?

14:58.307 --> 15:00.041
Morning, honey.

15:00.075 --> 15:01.576
What's the matter?
What's going on?

15:01.610 --> 15:03.912
I was just looking
at the rankings.

15:03.946 --> 15:06.014
And?

15:06.048 --> 15:07.715
Well, we didn't get ranked.

15:07.750 --> 15:09.317
That doesn't seem right.

15:09.351 --> 15:12.387
We went 2-8 last year.
What do you expect?

15:12.421 --> 15:13.922
What do you want for breakfast?

15:13.956 --> 15:15.223
Mac and cheese.

15:15.257 --> 15:18.059
- Mac and cheese, please.
- All right.

15:18.093 --> 15:23.231
Mac and cheese for breakfast...
That is one healthy diet, girl.

15:23.265 --> 15:24.432
You can't ask for blood, Tami,

15:24.467 --> 15:26.701
for something called
the homework club.

15:26.735 --> 15:28.369
Well, it's not called
the homework club.

15:28.404 --> 15:30.138
Well, that's what they call it
around here.

15:30.172 --> 15:31.940
Who's calling it
the homework club?

15:31.974 --> 15:34.909
This is tutoring.
It's... it's mentoring.

15:34.944 --> 15:37.479
This is what we're supposed
to be doing as educators.

15:37.513 --> 15:40.114
Well, you are a great counselor,
and you're a great educator,

15:40.149 --> 15:42.116
but the teachers feel
like you're lecturing them.

15:42.151 --> 15:43.751
I am not lecturing.

15:43.786 --> 15:46.321
I don't think it's wrong
about what you're doing.

15:46.355 --> 15:49.491
I just think you're going
about it the wrong way.

15:49.525 --> 15:51.960
Tami, build up
some allegiances,

15:51.994 --> 15:54.496
and then hit them up
for help, okay?

15:59.235 --> 16:00.935
Boy, stop looking.

16:00.970 --> 16:03.605
Strong right, power pass,
they switch the cover-2...

16:03.639 --> 16:05.106
What's your read?

16:05.140 --> 16:07.075
- Uh, wait for "x" to pass...
- Hey, Vince.

16:07.109 --> 16:09.077
Throw it to "z"...
In the post.

16:09.111 --> 16:10.778
- Hey, Maura, how you doing?
- I'm good.

16:10.813 --> 16:12.247
I just needed to get
your address,

16:12.281 --> 16:14.649
so I can deliver
your pregame package.

16:14.683 --> 16:19.554
2609 Travis, apartment 23.

16:19.588 --> 16:21.556
Yeah, the Cross Street
is grant too.

16:21.590 --> 16:22.991
It's near the chicken shack.

16:23.025 --> 16:24.859
Mm, yeah, I know where it is.

16:24.894 --> 16:26.828
- Cool.
- Thanks.

16:29.732 --> 16:31.099
You want to go to defense?

16:31.133 --> 16:32.867
Yeah, let's do that.

16:32.902 --> 16:34.135
Let's go to defense.

16:34.169 --> 16:35.904
On the half!
Let's go!

16:35.938 --> 16:36.938
Come on!

16:36.972 --> 16:38.840
You seeing anything
out here at all?

16:38.874 --> 16:40.375
Coach, we got no energy.

16:40.409 --> 16:41.876
We got no zip.

16:41.911 --> 16:43.645
We're just flat.

16:43.679 --> 16:45.580
Maybe we should just
have them run suicides

16:45.614 --> 16:46.581
for the rest of practice.

16:46.615 --> 16:47.949
I'm good with that.

16:47.983 --> 16:50.885
I think they're all
just so depressed.

16:50.920 --> 16:52.153
What?

16:52.187 --> 16:54.656
The Lions have been ignored.

16:57.393 --> 16:58.459
Let's go!
Come on!

16:58.494 --> 17:00.862
Hey, mo,
what's Croft ranked now?

17:00.896 --> 17:03.197
Uh, they're ranked 9.

17:03.232 --> 17:04.299
9.

17:04.333 --> 17:06.768
Last week, before you all
beat 'em, they were ranked 8.

17:06.801 --> 17:08.002
How we gonna beat
a top-10 team

17:08.037 --> 17:09.537
and they don't even put us
in the top 20?

17:09.571 --> 17:10.805
We went through the same thing.

17:10.839 --> 17:12.440
We walked all over Croft.
We beat 'em up.

17:12.473 --> 17:15.009
Man, I told y'all this was
some kind of damn conspiracy!

17:15.044 --> 17:16.511
They don't want to give us
no respect!

17:16.545 --> 17:18.079
They're not looking
at rushing yards.

17:18.113 --> 17:19.480
- Damn right!
- Mo, thanks, man.

17:19.515 --> 17:20.615
Hey, listen up.

17:20.648 --> 17:22.650
Hey, pick up your helmet
and shut your mouth.

17:22.685 --> 17:25.153
You know what? I told you
about this already, didn't I?

17:25.186 --> 17:27.989
I want you to run until I
tell you not to run anymore.

17:28.022 --> 17:29.457
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, sir.

17:29.491 --> 17:31.392
Let's see you hit the road
right now.

17:31.427 --> 17:32.694
Keep running.
You keep running.

17:32.728 --> 17:34.329
Start now and keep.
You can go join him.

17:34.363 --> 17:35.663
You can't keep
your mouth shut either?

17:35.698 --> 17:37.265
I talked to you
about this already.

17:37.299 --> 17:38.499
Listen up.

17:38.534 --> 17:40.368
I don't want to hear
any more crap out here

17:40.402 --> 17:42.203
about these rankings,
do you understand?

17:42.237 --> 17:43.538
No more!
That's it!

17:43.572 --> 17:44.872
Get back out there.
Let's go.

17:44.907 --> 17:46.307
We're starting practice
all over again.

17:46.342 --> 17:47.308
Come on, man.

17:47.343 --> 17:48.476
I got enough to worry about,

17:48.510 --> 17:49.978
and here you're riling
these kids up.

17:50.012 --> 17:53.014
Don't bring that out here,
all right?

17:53.048 --> 17:55.016
Thank you.

17:55.050 --> 17:56.918
Let's go!
Pick it up!

18:02.124 --> 18:04.559
Ah, sorry.

18:07.463 --> 18:10.698
Great.

18:10.733 --> 18:11.733
Hello?

18:11.767 --> 18:13.134
Hello.
Hey, sweetheart!

18:13.168 --> 18:14.602
Wait. Wait. Wait.
Hold on one second.

18:14.637 --> 18:15.603
Hold on one second.

18:15.638 --> 18:17.205
I only get, like, one bar

18:17.239 --> 18:19.741
in my office, so I have
to come... Can you hear me?

18:19.775 --> 18:21.576
Yeah, hey.

18:21.610 --> 18:23.478
Hi.
How are you, babe?

18:23.512 --> 18:24.879
I'm good.

18:24.913 --> 18:26.714
How's your roommate?
You like her?

18:26.749 --> 18:30.084
Yeah, she's just busy a lot.

18:30.119 --> 18:32.220
Well, how are your classes?

18:32.254 --> 18:34.622
Um, they're pretty
interesting, I guess.

18:34.657 --> 18:40.161
I'm trying to decide between great
myths of the American south and econ.

18:40.195 --> 18:42.630
I don't know.
I think, with econ, you know,

18:42.665 --> 18:44.699
it's always something
you can use in real life.

18:44.733 --> 18:48.870
Yeah, I... Mom, I wasn't really
asking your opinion.

18:48.904 --> 18:51.239
I know, honey,
and I wasn't pressuring you.

18:51.273 --> 18:54.142
I want you to do whatever it is
that excites you.

18:56.745 --> 18:57.712
Okay, mom.
I got to go.

18:57.746 --> 18:59.113
I'll talk to you later.
Bye-bye.

18:59.148 --> 19:01.582
All right, love you.
Bye.

19:03.218 --> 19:04.752
You can come back in now.

19:07.756 --> 19:10.024
Let me get
the chicken and ribs.

19:10.059 --> 19:11.592
Man, listen,
they're just letters.

19:11.627 --> 19:14.295
Yeah, recruitment letters,
a-a lot of recruitment letters.

19:14.329 --> 19:16.064
I'm not even thinking
about that right now.

19:16.098 --> 19:17.465
Let's just get these "w"s.

19:17.499 --> 19:18.800
It's a marathon...
Thank you...

19:18.834 --> 19:21.369
- not a sprint.
- Sausage, please, and the ribs.

19:21.403 --> 19:23.371
Is Hastings pissing you off too?
He's bugging me.

19:23.405 --> 19:25.473
You've been
very angry lately, Luke.

19:25.507 --> 19:27.075
You need a hug?
You need some love, don't you?

19:27.109 --> 19:28.109
Yes, I need a hug.

19:28.143 --> 19:29.844
Thank you.
Appreciate it.

19:29.878 --> 19:31.279
He's a fruitcake, though, man.

19:31.313 --> 19:33.881
He's a very fast fruitcake
with amazing hands.

19:33.916 --> 19:36.884
Vince Howard.
Howdy.

19:36.919 --> 19:40.288
Let me shake
them cannons there, son.

19:40.322 --> 19:42.724
Bob Short.
I own short garden supplies.

19:42.758 --> 19:45.293
"Whatever you want,
get it in Short supply."

19:45.327 --> 19:46.961
Well, it's nice
to meet you, sir.

19:46.995 --> 19:48.362
Bob, please.

19:48.397 --> 19:50.398
I should be calling you "sir"
after that game last week.

19:50.432 --> 19:52.400
Yeah, well, it was a tough win.

19:52.434 --> 19:53.668
I got his dinner.

19:53.702 --> 19:56.671
No...
All right, thanks.

19:56.705 --> 20:00.108
Uh, ha... have you met Luke
Cafferty, Lions star running back?

20:00.142 --> 20:01.743
- Oh, okay.
- Very nice to meet you.

20:01.777 --> 20:03.010
Transferred last year.

20:03.045 --> 20:04.011
Yeah, okay.

20:04.046 --> 20:08.416
I got, uh... - Luke.
- Luke's too.

20:08.450 --> 20:12.186
You ever need anything,
call me.

20:12.221 --> 20:13.287
All right.

20:13.322 --> 20:15.757
Keep those guns up.

20:15.791 --> 20:17.792
Good meeting you, son.
You too, kid.

20:17.826 --> 20:19.961
Yeah, thanks.
Appreciate it.

20:19.995 --> 20:22.096
Thanks, Bob.

20:22.131 --> 20:24.665
You got enough bulbs up there?

20:24.700 --> 20:26.567
There's another box
in the back.

20:29.972 --> 20:31.539
What are you doing here?

20:31.573 --> 20:34.041
Hey, Eric.

20:34.076 --> 20:35.243
I just wanted to give you
a heads-up.

20:35.277 --> 20:41.115
You're gonna get a phone call
from the athletic administration.

20:41.150 --> 20:42.517
About what?

20:42.551 --> 20:44.085
They're having a hearing

20:44.119 --> 20:47.155
on that awesome hit
that Luke made last week.

20:47.189 --> 20:48.823
Where'd you hear that?

20:48.857 --> 20:51.392
I play golf
with Hank's brother.

20:51.426 --> 20:52.560
Who's Hank?

20:52.594 --> 20:56.497
Hank Simmons...
Athletic administration Hank Simmons.

20:56.532 --> 20:58.166
What the hell do they want?
It was a clean hit.

20:58.200 --> 21:00.234
- I was standing right there.
- I know. I know.

21:00.269 --> 21:03.871
They're saying, you know,
it's some kind of safety issue.

21:03.906 --> 21:07.341
And there's a chance that Luke
might get suspended.

21:07.376 --> 21:08.843
- You got to be kidding me.
- Oh, I know.

21:08.877 --> 21:11.879
It's just a bunch of bureaucrats
trying to cover their asses!

21:38.307 --> 21:39.774
Come on.
Come on!

21:39.808 --> 21:41.242
Oh, come on, Jones!

21:41.276 --> 21:43.911
What are you, blind?

21:45.147 --> 21:46.781
Nice.
Nice!

21:48.984 --> 21:51.485
Oh!
Yeah!

21:54.056 --> 21:56.757
Oh...
Oh!

21:56.792 --> 21:58.159
Nice catch.

21:58.193 --> 21:59.894
It's a classic game.

21:59.928 --> 22:01.562
36 throwback.

22:01.597 --> 22:03.698
Classic, yeah,
but no throwback.

22:03.732 --> 22:05.733
No, I'm pretty sure
this is a throwback.

22:05.767 --> 22:07.368
It's my dad's favorite game.

22:07.402 --> 22:08.569
It's a great ending.

22:08.604 --> 22:10.705
Uh, I think you're wrong.

22:10.739 --> 22:13.274
You're pretty cocky
for somebody who's wrong.

22:13.308 --> 22:14.475
Yeah, I'm cocky.

22:14.509 --> 22:15.977
Hey.
Derek Bishop.

22:16.011 --> 22:17.211
Julie Taylor.

22:17.246 --> 22:19.080
You T.A. my history class.

22:19.114 --> 22:20.081
That's right.

22:20.115 --> 22:21.449
Nice to meet you, Julie Taylor.

22:21.483 --> 22:23.517
So you're a football fan?

22:23.552 --> 22:29.457
Uh... My dad's a high-school-football
coach, so not really.

22:29.491 --> 22:32.693
Yeah, there's no
36 throwback in this.

22:35.197 --> 22:37.198
There's a 36 throwback.

22:37.232 --> 22:39.200
I'd bet my life on it.

22:39.234 --> 22:42.937
So have a nice night.

22:42.971 --> 22:44.438
You're wrong.

22:44.473 --> 22:46.107
We'll see.

22:59.288 --> 23:01.956
Maura, I have a question.

23:01.990 --> 23:03.524
What's that?

23:03.558 --> 23:05.993
Isn't it a little demeaning
when a girl puts her panties

23:06.028 --> 23:07.795
in the locker
of a boy she barely knows?

23:07.829 --> 23:09.363
Ooh.

23:09.398 --> 23:11.666
Is someone getting
a little jealous?

23:11.700 --> 23:14.535
No, look, you don't get me.

23:14.569 --> 23:15.803
Hear me out.

23:15.837 --> 23:17.705
When you put your panties
in his locker,

23:17.739 --> 23:20.308
what does that say about
your self-respect, you know?

23:20.342 --> 23:23.511
What does that say about
how you feel about yourself?

23:23.545 --> 23:25.646
I think what that says about me

23:25.681 --> 23:28.416
is that I'm gonna have
your man in two weeks,

23:28.450 --> 23:31.218
and there isn't a thing
you can do about it.

23:31.253 --> 23:32.553
Okay.

23:32.587 --> 23:33.754
You know what?

23:33.789 --> 23:37.024
I was trying to enlighten
your heifer ass.

23:37.059 --> 23:38.893
But it's just not working.

23:38.927 --> 23:41.062
Well, you know what?
Enlighten this, you dumbass.

23:41.096 --> 23:42.964
Oh, bitch!

23:42.998 --> 23:44.332
Let go of me!

23:51.039 --> 23:52.373
Ehhh!

23:55.811 --> 23:57.812
You're an honor student.

23:57.846 --> 23:59.981
What are you doing
fighting in the bathroom?

24:00.015 --> 24:01.048
Okay, she pushed me first.

24:01.083 --> 24:03.351
Uh-uh.
I don't want to hear that.

24:03.385 --> 24:04.919
What's going on in your head?

24:04.953 --> 24:09.323
I didn't go in there trying
to... to fight her or anything.

24:09.358 --> 24:11.625
I mean, I was just going
in there to talk to her

24:11.660 --> 24:13.928
about this whole stupid
rally-girl stuff,

24:13.962 --> 24:16.330
'cause it's, like...
I think it's demeaning

24:16.365 --> 24:19.266
for her to put her panties
in my boyfriend's locker.

24:21.003 --> 24:23.037
It's a part of Texas football.

24:23.071 --> 24:25.006
Well, the thing is, like...

24:25.040 --> 24:27.408
I'm someone
who loves Texas football.

24:27.442 --> 24:30.978
You know, like, my father
played most of his life,

24:31.013 --> 24:33.447
and my little brothers
now play,

24:33.482 --> 24:35.583
and I had so much fun
this summer

24:35.617 --> 24:38.686
helping Vince get better
at his game and stuff.

24:38.720 --> 24:40.221
I don't know.
I love the game.

24:40.255 --> 24:43.324
I jus...
I understand it.

24:43.358 --> 24:45.026
I'm sorry for that.

24:45.060 --> 24:47.695
So I'm gonna find
some extracurricular things

24:47.729 --> 24:50.498
for you to do after school
so you can work this off,

24:50.532 --> 24:53.034
and you are not
gonna fight again.

24:53.068 --> 24:55.202
Yes, ma'am.

24:55.237 --> 24:56.971
You get Burnwell to sing
at happy hour,

24:57.005 --> 24:59.173
I will buy your drinks
for the entire semester.

24:59.207 --> 25:01.042
So same time, same place,
all that?

25:01.076 --> 25:02.376
Hey, y'all.

25:02.411 --> 25:03.944
Hey.

25:03.979 --> 25:05.179
What's going on?

25:05.213 --> 25:07.081
You just caught us
talking about happy hour.

25:07.115 --> 25:08.182
Oh, y'all do a happy hour?

25:08.216 --> 25:09.784
Rivera's every Thursday night.

25:09.818 --> 25:11.218
Yeah, you should come.

25:11.253 --> 25:12.853
Oh, thank you.

25:12.888 --> 25:15.689
Well, if I can get away
from the family, maybe I will.

25:15.724 --> 25:16.791
See y'all later.

25:16.825 --> 25:17.958
- Okay.
- See ya.

25:17.993 --> 25:19.193
Bye, Tami.

25:21.063 --> 25:23.431
Okay, now, if she came
to happy hour...

25:23.465 --> 25:26.333
Somebody's buying me drinks if
she comes to happy hour, right?

25:26.368 --> 25:27.768
I mean, come on.

25:27.803 --> 25:29.537
Hey, listen up.

25:29.571 --> 25:31.305
"Lion trouble: Inquiry
to focus on illegal hit."

25:31.339 --> 25:33.174
They're already saying
it's an illegal hit.

25:33.208 --> 25:35.409
See, first they screw us over
with the rankings, right?

25:35.444 --> 25:36.877
And now they're going
after Cafferty.

25:36.912 --> 25:37.945
Not even fair, dude.

25:37.979 --> 25:39.080
Why are they messing
with me, man?

25:39.114 --> 25:40.347
This is my life.

25:40.382 --> 25:41.582
They're gonna get me suspended
from a game.

25:41.616 --> 25:43.050
I know, it's messed up.
It's not right.

25:43.085 --> 25:45.853
It's a conspiracy.
They're trying to screw us.

25:45.887 --> 25:48.222
Hey, guys.
Listen to me.

25:48.256 --> 25:50.724
Coach, I speak for everybody
by saying...

25:50.759 --> 25:53.060
We feel like everybody's
out to get us.

25:53.095 --> 25:54.862
They're going after Luke,
saying his hit was illegal.

25:54.896 --> 25:56.297
He might get suspended.

25:56.331 --> 25:58.999
Doesn't it bother you
that nobody's respecting us?

26:04.873 --> 26:08.676
With all due respect, Vince, I
don't give a piss what you feel.

26:08.710 --> 26:10.177
Listen to me.

26:10.212 --> 26:11.912
There is no "they."

26:11.947 --> 26:15.649
It's an interleague
safety issue... That's it.

26:15.684 --> 26:17.485
It's a standard deal.
You've all seen it before.

26:17.519 --> 26:19.553
It's nothing more than that.

26:19.588 --> 26:21.956
If there was a problem,
I'd know about it.

26:21.990 --> 26:24.258
The staff would know about it.

26:24.292 --> 26:26.127
You would know about it.

26:26.161 --> 26:29.463
One day at a time,
one game at a time, right?

26:29.498 --> 26:30.598
- Yep.
- Yes, sir.

26:30.632 --> 26:33.200
One day at a time, one
game at a time, yeah?

26:33.235 --> 26:35.136
Yep.
Yes, sir.

26:36.805 --> 26:38.572
They give us no respect.

26:38.607 --> 26:40.474
I hope he's right.

26:50.886 --> 26:53.053
Look what the cat
dragged in here.

26:53.088 --> 26:55.256
- Mac, how you doing?
- How you doin', bud?

26:55.290 --> 26:57.525
- What are you doing here?
- I came over to say hello.

26:57.559 --> 26:59.627
You never come to see me.
Thought I'd come over here.

26:59.661 --> 27:01.028
- How are you?
- I got stuff to do here.

27:01.062 --> 27:02.630
Yeah?
You got a minute of time?

27:02.664 --> 27:05.132
- I need to talk to you.
- Sure.

27:05.167 --> 27:06.901
Of course
you're not ranked, Eric.

27:06.935 --> 27:08.435
What the hell's that mean?

27:08.470 --> 27:10.004
You're an outsider now.

27:10.038 --> 27:13.274
They're not gonna let you
back in.

27:13.308 --> 27:15.075
This inquiry wasn't the league.

27:15.110 --> 27:17.144
It was Jim Leland
over at Croft.

27:17.179 --> 27:19.747
- Jim?
- Yep.

27:19.781 --> 27:20.948
You know that for a fact?

27:20.982 --> 27:22.583
I know it for a fact.

27:22.617 --> 27:24.585
You ought to know it.

27:28.056 --> 27:29.456
I tell you what.

27:29.491 --> 27:34.929
We're still gonna kick y'all's
ass this year, no matter what.

27:34.963 --> 27:37.031
20 bucks and a shot
says your wrong.

27:37.065 --> 27:39.833
You're on.

27:51.146 --> 27:55.015
Uh, I'm not ready to turn
this into an office yet.

27:55.050 --> 27:57.885
She's only been gone a week.

27:57.919 --> 27:59.320
Yeah, well,

27:59.354 --> 28:01.789
it's not like we're renting out
her room or anything.

28:01.823 --> 28:04.892
I just don't want to get rid
of all her little things,

28:04.926 --> 28:07.394
little mementos and whatnot.

28:07.429 --> 28:09.563
So I just got asked out
to happy hour

28:09.598 --> 28:10.664
from the teachers at school.

28:10.699 --> 28:12.032
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

28:12.067 --> 28:13.867
Can't get any support
from any of these teachers,

28:13.902 --> 28:16.003
can't get them to sign up
for my mentoring workshop,

28:16.037 --> 28:18.038
none of that, but,
"oh, come on to happy hour."

28:18.073 --> 28:19.373
Where's the happy hour?

28:19.407 --> 28:20.641
Rivera's.

28:20.675 --> 28:22.776
Hey, Rivera's is a great place.

28:22.811 --> 28:24.845
You know what?
I'm gonna go to happy hour.

28:24.879 --> 28:27.314
And I'm gonna create
some allegiances,

28:27.349 --> 28:29.049
so maybe I can get some help
over there.

28:29.084 --> 28:30.217
You should do that.

28:30.252 --> 28:31.418
Rivera's is a happy place.

28:31.453 --> 28:34.221
You start having cocktails, everyone
will talk about everything.

28:34.256 --> 28:39.260
It's easier to get flies
with honey than it is vinegar.

28:41.062 --> 28:42.930
Come here.

28:44.833 --> 28:46.533
Oh, no,
that is our daughter's bed.

28:46.568 --> 28:47.735
Are you crazy?

28:47.769 --> 28:49.703
That is disgusting.

28:53.608 --> 28:55.209
Hi, sweetie.

29:03.785 --> 29:05.653
Who's smoking in here?

29:07.656 --> 29:09.089
Hey, Epyck.

29:09.124 --> 29:13.027
Aren't you supposed to be
in social sciences right now?

29:13.061 --> 29:15.763
I'll get there.

29:15.797 --> 29:17.398
What in the hell are you doing?

29:17.432 --> 29:19.500
Putting out your cigarette
and taking you to class.

29:19.534 --> 29:22.403
Come on.

29:22.437 --> 29:24.705
You want to hold my hand?

29:24.739 --> 29:26.540
How the hell do you know
my schedule, anyway?

29:26.574 --> 29:28.375
- It's none of your business.
- It is my business.

29:28.410 --> 29:29.710
I'm the guidance counselor.

29:29.744 --> 29:31.745
Well, the last one didn't care.

29:31.780 --> 29:34.615
Well, I care.

29:34.649 --> 29:37.351
And I expect to have you
and at least one parent

29:37.385 --> 29:40.087
in a meeting with me
within the next 48 hours.

29:40.121 --> 29:41.255
Yeah, my foster parents

29:41.289 --> 29:42.923
are really gonna give a crap
what you want.

29:42.957 --> 29:44.024
Hey.

29:46.461 --> 29:49.430
If you don't have somebody
at home that cares about you

29:49.464 --> 29:55.069
and cares about your grades,
I am sorry about that.

29:55.103 --> 29:58.138
You don't deserve that,
and it's not fair.

30:00.008 --> 30:01.508
Are you done?

30:01.543 --> 30:02.810
Yeah.

30:19.227 --> 30:21.061
You can watch it
five more times.

30:21.096 --> 30:22.429
Doesn't matter.

30:22.464 --> 30:25.299
That's a good, clean,
honest hit between the whistles.

30:25.333 --> 30:27.368
I stand by my player.

30:27.402 --> 30:30.104
I disagree.
Your player led with his helmet.

30:30.138 --> 30:32.306
His eyes were up.
His shoulders were squared.

30:32.340 --> 30:33.607
There was no flag thrown.

30:33.641 --> 30:34.975
So what you're saying, I think,

30:35.009 --> 30:37.778
is that referees were wrong
in not throwing the flag.

30:37.812 --> 30:40.714
In this case, yes,
the refs made a mistake.

30:40.749 --> 30:42.449
They should have thrown the flag.

30:42.484 --> 30:44.685
It's our right and our duty
to correct this,

30:44.719 --> 30:47.354
and what you think
is irrelevant, coach.

30:47.389 --> 30:48.822
I don't think we'd be here,

30:48.857 --> 30:51.024
if we hadn't beat a team
we weren't supposed to beat.

30:51.059 --> 30:57.297
Two days... two days after the
game, this complaint comes about.

30:57.332 --> 31:00.134
As we said,
it's a safety issue.

31:00.168 --> 31:02.369
We have to send a message.

31:02.404 --> 31:07.207
Boy, I got your message
loud and clear.

31:16.684 --> 31:17.851
Go!

31:19.687 --> 31:25.225
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

31:29.531 --> 31:31.231
Becky!
Get up here, girl!

31:31.266 --> 31:32.900
I don't do beer.
Sorry.

31:32.934 --> 31:35.035
Yeah, you go.

31:37.105 --> 31:38.372
Where's Tinker?

31:38.406 --> 31:40.207
He's, uh...
He's over there by the...

31:40.241 --> 31:42.209
Hey, but, hey, yo, dude,
none of us are drinking tonight.

31:42.243 --> 31:44.311
We got that big game
against Laribee tomorrow.

31:44.345 --> 31:45.979
I talked to coach.

31:46.014 --> 31:47.681
I got suspended for a game.

31:47.715 --> 31:50.517
Are you serious?

31:50.552 --> 31:52.486
Hey, hey, dude.

31:54.689 --> 31:56.123
Where's the quarterback?

31:56.157 --> 31:57.357
Maria.

31:57.392 --> 31:59.059
- Oh, Vince.
- Hmm?

31:59.093 --> 32:00.594
How about a kiss
for the winner?

32:00.628 --> 32:01.595
I can't.

32:01.629 --> 32:02.763
I can't.
Come on, yo.

32:02.797 --> 32:04.565
What, Jess,
you got something to say?

32:04.599 --> 32:08.402
You know, I wouldn't mind...
I do want to see this.

32:08.436 --> 32:10.804
Let's do this.
Come on.

32:10.839 --> 32:12.005
All right, go!

32:13.942 --> 32:17.277
Chug! Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

32:21.216 --> 32:22.549
Another day.
Cheers.

32:22.584 --> 32:24.251
Cheers.

32:24.285 --> 32:28.055
Cheers, y'all.

32:28.089 --> 32:30.657
What are you doing
drinking a beer?

32:30.692 --> 32:32.059
Just having a drink.

32:34.529 --> 32:37.431
Are you all talking
about Marilyn Monroe?

32:37.465 --> 32:39.766
Whoever she asks
gets to get it.

32:39.801 --> 32:41.168
What do you teach?

32:41.202 --> 32:43.604
- History of government.
- Uh-huh?

32:43.638 --> 32:45.806
Well, good.
That's always interesting.

32:45.840 --> 32:46.940
Uh-huh.

32:46.975 --> 32:51.044
Um, doesn't have to be
anything fancy, but, you know.

32:51.079 --> 32:54.548
And, you know, I think...
we talked about this last time.

32:54.582 --> 32:56.183
I'll drink on that one.
Tony Dorsett.

32:56.217 --> 32:57.718
Come on.

32:57.752 --> 32:59.586
Oh, no!

32:59.621 --> 33:02.389
- Oh!
- Oh, goodness gracious.

33:02.423 --> 33:03.624
Oh, heavens.

33:03.658 --> 33:05.225
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, no, it's fine.

33:05.260 --> 33:06.493
- I'm so sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

33:06.528 --> 33:08.128
That doesn't happen
every time, I promise.

33:08.162 --> 33:09.930
We actually make it
through several of these...

33:09.964 --> 33:11.632
No, actually, I'm gonna
head on home anyway.

33:11.666 --> 33:13.233
We got a baby
and all that, so...

33:13.268 --> 33:14.735
All right,
I'll see y'all later.

33:14.769 --> 33:16.603
- All right.
- Bye.

33:16.638 --> 33:17.971
Thank you.
Buh-bye.

33:18.006 --> 33:20.941
Y'all have a good one.

33:20.975 --> 33:22.609
Good lord.

33:22.644 --> 33:23.710
I swear.

33:23.745 --> 33:25.812
Tami, wait.

33:25.847 --> 33:28.081
- Oh, hey.
- I'm sorry about that.

33:28.116 --> 33:30.584
Oh, no, it's fine.
It's fine.

33:30.618 --> 33:32.019
It'll get easier.

33:32.053 --> 33:36.123
It's always hard to be new and
at a table of cynical people.

33:36.157 --> 33:38.091
No, everybody's fine.

33:38.126 --> 33:39.826
I know you must have thought
we were cynical.

33:39.861 --> 33:41.161
I'm sorry.

33:41.195 --> 33:42.696
No, you know what?

33:42.730 --> 33:45.065
Honestly, I am just trying
to help these kids,

33:45.099 --> 33:49.369
and I'm looking
for a little support, frankly.

33:49.404 --> 33:50.604
Yeah.

33:50.638 --> 33:54.107
Well, you know that after-school
mentor program?

33:54.142 --> 33:56.910
I can...
I'll volunteer for that.

33:56.945 --> 33:58.145
Oh, really?

33:58.179 --> 33:59.513
Sure, sign me up.

33:59.547 --> 34:00.981
Oh, good!

34:01.015 --> 34:02.482
Thank you.

34:02.517 --> 34:03.784
We'll talk about it.

34:03.818 --> 34:05.452
- Great!
- Okay.

34:05.486 --> 34:06.453
Good night.

34:06.487 --> 34:07.654
- Thanks, Laurel.
- Okay, sure.

34:07.689 --> 34:09.056
All right.
I'll see you tomorrow.

34:09.090 --> 34:10.257
All right.
See you tomorrow.

34:10.291 --> 34:12.092
Bye.

34:12.126 --> 34:13.393
Oh, good.

34:13.428 --> 34:15.195
Look at that.

34:15.228 --> 34:17.898
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug! Chug!

34:22.235 --> 34:24.504
Ew.
All right, now, get it out.

34:24.539 --> 34:25.672
Get it out.

34:25.706 --> 34:27.708
Come on.

34:27.742 --> 34:28.909
Ugh!

34:28.943 --> 34:30.177
Come on, go ahead.

34:30.210 --> 34:33.013
Go ahead, just...
Go ahead, yeah, mm-hmm.

34:34.114 --> 34:35.616
You're all right.

34:35.650 --> 34:36.949
Ugh.

34:36.985 --> 34:38.819
You want to sit down?

34:38.853 --> 34:40.587
Come here.

34:44.391 --> 34:46.159
I don't want you to think

34:46.194 --> 34:48.462
this has got anything to do
with Maura.

34:48.496 --> 34:51.197
Baby, I think it has a lot
to do with Maura.

34:51.232 --> 34:54.001
I...
I miss you.

34:55.268 --> 34:56.570
Miss...
Miss what?

34:56.603 --> 34:58.271
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm right here.

34:58.306 --> 34:59.706
I don't miss you.

34:59.741 --> 35:02.976
I miss the football of you.

35:03.011 --> 35:07.214
Like, the way we were practicing
over the summer, you know?

35:07.248 --> 35:10.817
Like, going over strategies
and stuff, and...

35:10.852 --> 35:13.320
And you got coach now.

35:13.354 --> 35:15.522
And I'm supposed to be
a rally girl.

35:19.594 --> 35:21.561
I know.
I'm just terrible.

35:21.596 --> 35:23.864
I'm a girl,
and I like football.

35:29.103 --> 35:30.270
You all right?

35:30.304 --> 35:32.472
Come here.

35:32.507 --> 35:33.740
Come on, champ.

35:33.775 --> 35:35.208
I'll get you home.

35:35.243 --> 35:36.610
At least you won.

35:40.982 --> 35:42.616
Ah, wait!

35:42.650 --> 35:44.551
What's he doing to her?

35:44.585 --> 35:46.253
No, no, no!
No, no!

35:46.287 --> 35:47.721
Y'all leave that girl alone!

35:47.755 --> 35:49.022
Take her home.

35:49.057 --> 35:52.025
Take her home!
Take her home!

35:52.060 --> 35:55.028
Oh, we're just
working it up a bit.

35:55.063 --> 35:56.229
They need to leave her alone.

35:56.264 --> 35:58.398
I'm gonna get you home
right now.

35:59.667 --> 36:00.701
Hey, hey.

36:00.735 --> 36:01.902
Douche bag!

36:01.936 --> 36:03.437
Why are you even on our team?

36:03.471 --> 36:05.138
You don't give a rat's ass.

36:05.173 --> 36:06.473
I asked you a question.

36:06.507 --> 36:08.575
I'm talking to you.

36:08.609 --> 36:10.811
Is there something going on
in there or not?

36:10.845 --> 36:12.279
You hearing me?

36:12.313 --> 36:13.914
Why don't you go dip your head
in some water, Opie, all right?

36:13.948 --> 36:15.382
Look at me
when I'm talking to you!

36:15.416 --> 36:18.418
Get your hands off me.

36:18.453 --> 36:20.353
Becky.

36:20.388 --> 36:22.022
Hey.

36:22.056 --> 36:24.291
- Give me your keys.
- Why?

36:24.325 --> 36:26.026
'Cause I'm gonna find you
a ride home.

36:26.060 --> 36:27.394
I'll be fine.

36:27.428 --> 36:29.896
Yeah, but, um...
Hastings!

36:29.931 --> 36:31.098
Hey, no, I know you are.

36:31.132 --> 36:32.799
I just... I really want
to get out of here,

36:32.834 --> 36:34.134
and you're a good excuse.

36:34.168 --> 36:35.435
Okay.

36:35.470 --> 36:39.573
Okay, so...
Come on.

36:39.607 --> 36:40.640
All right.

36:40.675 --> 36:41.975
Come on.
Let's go.

36:42.009 --> 36:44.077
Okay.

36:58.760 --> 37:00.527
Thanks, Becky.

37:00.561 --> 37:02.562
You're welcome.

37:02.597 --> 37:05.098
I traded my pig for you.

37:05.133 --> 37:07.134
What?

37:07.168 --> 37:08.235
Maribelle.

37:08.269 --> 37:11.171
Like, Tinker's in love with her,
and I said he could have her

37:11.205 --> 37:13.607
if I could have you
for my rally girl.

37:13.641 --> 37:16.743
Well, how does the pig feel
about that?

37:20.148 --> 37:23.683
You want to come up
for a second?

37:23.718 --> 37:25.685
Not tonight.

37:27.855 --> 37:29.990
I'll see you at school.

37:32.693 --> 37:34.728
Good night.

37:36.063 --> 37:38.064
Okay.

37:41.369 --> 37:43.236
- Bye.
- Bye.

38:00.221 --> 38:04.324
Thanks.
See you at school.

38:16.938 --> 38:18.338
Hey.

38:18.372 --> 38:20.373
If you are going to live
in this house,

38:20.408 --> 38:22.509
there are rules, because we
have been up half the night

38:22.543 --> 38:24.144
worried sick about you.

38:24.178 --> 38:26.279
I'm sorry.
I-I didn't think I had a curfew.

38:26.314 --> 38:27.781
You didn't think, did you?
That's the problem.

38:27.815 --> 38:29.282
Because you cannot
be out all night

38:29.317 --> 38:30.750
when we are responsible
for you.

38:30.785 --> 38:32.853
I'm sorry.

38:32.887 --> 38:34.988
I'm just not really used
to people noticing.

38:35.022 --> 38:38.058
Well, get used to it.

38:38.092 --> 38:41.761
Go to bed.

38:41.796 --> 38:44.297
Okay.
Good night.

38:51.572 --> 38:53.206
Morning.

39:00.181 --> 39:01.615
Morning.

39:01.649 --> 39:03.850
I'm here
for our stupid meeting.

39:03.885 --> 39:05.752
Come on in.

39:15.596 --> 39:17.931
All right,
I'll see you guys later, okay?

39:17.965 --> 39:19.532
Hey, football!

39:19.567 --> 39:21.701
Hey.

39:21.736 --> 39:23.570
You were right the other day.

39:23.604 --> 39:24.838
I googled the game.

39:24.872 --> 39:27.407
It was 36 throwback.

39:27.441 --> 39:28.441
Nice.

39:28.476 --> 39:30.410
So you trust Google
more than me.

39:32.346 --> 39:34.881
You know, I-I feel like
we should have bet something,

39:34.916 --> 39:36.583
and since you clearly
would have won,

39:36.617 --> 39:40.921
how about I buy you a coffee?

39:40.955 --> 39:42.155
Sure.

39:42.189 --> 39:45.292
And by the way,
my name's Julie, not football.

39:45.326 --> 39:47.761
Okay.

39:47.795 --> 39:49.629
You know where my office is.

39:49.664 --> 39:51.631
See you after class.

39:51.666 --> 39:53.099
Okay.

39:53.134 --> 39:54.668
Bye, Julie.

40:00.908 --> 40:04.277
About two years.

40:04.312 --> 40:07.314
Alamo freeze, Dillon, Texas.

40:07.348 --> 40:09.449
That was a fast-food job.

40:09.483 --> 40:12.252
Okay, where were you in 2008?

40:12.286 --> 40:13.620
This has nothing down here.

40:13.654 --> 40:16.523
Um...
I just had some...

40:16.557 --> 40:21.328
Some problems come up
during that time.

40:29.170 --> 40:30.770
Bye, now.

40:37.044 --> 40:38.678
- I got it.
- Got it, yes!

40:48.456 --> 40:50.123
With Luke Cafferty suspended,

40:50.157 --> 40:52.425
coach Taylor is gonna
have to take pause

40:52.460 --> 40:55.829
and think about what
his next move's gonna be.

40:55.863 --> 40:59.265
The U.I.L. has sent a loud
and clear message to the Lions...

40:59.300 --> 41:02.969
"y'all better watch
yourselves."

41:15.282 --> 41:17.050
We got it.
We got it.

41:22.156 --> 41:23.256
That's what we got to do.

41:25.926 --> 41:27.394
Let's go out and hit 'em
in the mouth.

41:27.428 --> 41:28.561
You understand?

41:30.598 --> 41:33.099
Quiet! Listen!
Quiet down!

41:48.282 --> 41:49.249
Mm-hmm.

41:49.283 --> 41:50.650
That's it, yeah.

41:58.859 --> 42:01.027
Let's go!
