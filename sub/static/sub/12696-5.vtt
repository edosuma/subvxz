00:08.300 --> 00:10.567
- *

00:10.667 --> 00:12.700
- Mom, Nora grew last night.

00:12.800 --> 00:16.033
- I'm finally tall enough
to go on Thunderman: The Ride!

00:16.133 --> 00:17.500
- That's great.

00:17.600 --> 00:19.533
I told you, if you
were only patient--

00:19.633 --> 00:23.400
and you're standing on
my romance novels.

00:23.500 --> 00:25.933
Honey, you can't walk around
Amazing Land like that.

00:26.033 --> 00:30.067
- Sure I can. Oops!

00:30.167 --> 00:33.467
- And she's down.

00:33.567 --> 00:35.500
- Honey, your Dad will be here
any second to measure you

00:35.600 --> 00:37.867
and then we'll know
if you can get on that ride.

00:37.967 --> 00:39.067
- I really hope so.

00:39.167 --> 00:40.767
I've been waiting for Nora
to be tall enough

00:40.867 --> 00:42.967
so our first ride
can be together.

00:43.067 --> 00:44.500
- We even made a special
friendship frame

00:44.600 --> 00:46.667
to hold the picture we're
gonna take on the ride.

00:46.767 --> 00:50.067
- And we've been practicing
our scream faces.

00:54.833 --> 00:56.933
- He's back!

00:57.033 --> 01:00.133
- I borrowed this
from Amazing Land.

01:00.233 --> 01:03.800
Funny story--the day this
picture was taken, it was 1997--

01:03.900 --> 01:05.067
- Blah, blah, blah,
you did stuff.

01:05.167 --> 01:07.767
Measure me!

01:07.867 --> 01:10.833
Yes, I'm a giant!

01:12.167 --> 01:13.833
- Congratulations.

01:13.933 --> 01:15.067
- Thank you. Thank you.

01:15.167 --> 01:17.867
You all finally recognized
my greatness.

01:17.967 --> 01:20.067
- Sorry, Max, I think
that was for me.

01:20.167 --> 01:22.633
I got my hair cut yesterday.

01:22.733 --> 01:25.533
- Actually, we don't care about
either of those things--

01:25.633 --> 01:28.100
because we are all going
to Amazing Land

01:28.200 --> 01:29.933
to ride Thunderman: The Ride!

01:33.400 --> 01:35.100
- Nora's finally tall enough.

01:35.200 --> 01:36.833
Come on, everyone,
let's get ready.

01:36.933 --> 01:39.233
- HANK: Yay!
- BILLY: Woo!

01:39.333 --> 01:44.067
- Thunderman: The Ride.
- This isn't happening.

01:56.333 --> 01:58.200
- That was the most
terrifying thing ever.

01:58.300 --> 02:00.667
- What kind of people
would enjoy that?

02:00.767 --> 02:03.133
- That was amazing!

02:03.233 --> 02:05.933
- Come on, kids,
off to the next ride.

02:06.067 --> 02:08.200
- BARB & HANK:

02:08.300 --> 02:11.600
- MAX & PHOEBE:
Never again.

02:11.700 --> 02:13.767
Never again!

02:14.600 --> 02:18.667
Never again.
Never again!

02:18.767 --> 02:20.067
- Also, let's never hug
each other again.

02:20.133 --> 02:22.600
- Totally.

02:22.700 --> 02:24.933
- *

02:25.067 --> 02:26.167
* What you see

02:26.267 --> 02:27.600
* Is not what you get

02:27.700 --> 02:30.933
* Livin' our lives
with a secret *

02:31.067 --> 02:32.700
* We fit right in

02:32.800 --> 02:34.200
* Bet you never guessed

02:34.300 --> 02:35.700
* 'Cause we're
livin' our lives *

02:35.800 --> 02:37.300
* Just like all the rest

02:37.400 --> 02:39.067
* A picture
perfect family *

02:39.167 --> 02:41.133
* Is what we try to be

02:41.233 --> 02:42.333
* Look closer,
you might see *

02:42.433 --> 02:44.100
* The crazy things we do

02:44.200 --> 02:45.867
* This isn't
make believe *

02:45.967 --> 02:47.433
* It's our reality

02:47.533 --> 02:48.833
* Just your average family

02:48.933 --> 02:52.100
* Trying to be normal
and stay out of trouble *

02:52.200 --> 02:55.767
* Livin' a double life *

02:58.667 --> 03:00.133
- I can't go on
that ride again.

03:00.233 --> 03:02.733
The automated voice still
haunts my dreams.

03:02.833 --> 03:05.833
"Secure personal objects
and enjoy the ride."

03:05.933 --> 03:07.533
I will not "enjoy the ride"!

03:07.633 --> 03:10.500
- And I will not
"secure personal objects"!

03:10.600 --> 03:12.200
- I'm sure if we just told
Mom and Dad the truth,

03:12.300 --> 03:13.367
they wouldn't make us go.

03:13.467 --> 03:14.833
- No one can know.

03:14.933 --> 03:16.200
If it got out that two supes

03:16.300 --> 03:18.333
are afraid of
amusement park rides,

03:18.433 --> 03:20.433
our lives would be ruined.

03:20.533 --> 03:23.333
Well, you don't have a life,
but I have everything to lose.

03:23.433 --> 03:25.100
- Yes, because
a talking rabbit

03:25.200 --> 03:29.300
and boy band hair
is everything.

03:29.400 --> 03:31.800
- I knew, one day,
Nora would be tall enough.

03:31.900 --> 03:34.300
- Curse her love of milk!

03:34.400 --> 03:37.100
- Which is why I have a plan.

03:39.067 --> 03:40.733
- We change our identities.

03:40.833 --> 03:44.733
I'll be Benito Sancho Gallini,
the Duke of Portugal,

03:44.833 --> 03:49.067
and you're "Steve."

03:49.133 --> 03:51.333
- Wait, Max, while you were
explaining your dumb idea,

03:51.433 --> 03:52.967
I just came up with
something a lot easier.

03:53.067 --> 03:55.400
Let's just tell Mom and Dad
we already have plans.

03:55.500 --> 03:59.333
- Okay, we'll do your idea.
- Great.

03:59.433 --> 04:00.533
Why won't this thing
come off?

04:00.633 --> 04:02.267
- It's the glue, Steve.

04:02.367 --> 04:05.333
- Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Ow! Ow! Ow!

04:07.200 --> 04:09.500
- Ow!

04:10.467 --> 04:13.767
- Oh, oh, yeah!
Watch that candy.

04:13.867 --> 04:17.700
Sure I'll buy more cherry chews.
Not my credit card.

04:17.800 --> 04:20.667
- HANK: Colosso!

04:20.767 --> 04:22.733
- Uh-oh.

04:22.833 --> 04:25.667
- I was just buying tickets
to Amazing Land

04:25.767 --> 04:28.767
when I found out someone else
has been using my credit card,

04:28.867 --> 04:32.800
playing an on-line game
called "Candy Squash"?

04:32.900 --> 04:34.933
- I'm sorry, I've never
heard of it.

04:36.667 --> 04:38.900
- MALE VOICE:
Your candy is squashed.

04:39.067 --> 04:41.233
Game over.

04:41.333 --> 04:45.600
- Oh, Candy Squash.

04:45.700 --> 04:49.367
- You just spent $2,000
on virtual candy?

04:49.467 --> 04:52.167
I mean, real candy, I get.
But virtual candy?

04:52.267 --> 04:56.833
You're gonna pay me back or
I will be playing Rabbit Squash.

04:56.933 --> 05:00.500
- Wait! How am I supposed
to come up with $2,000?

05:00.600 --> 05:03.400
You turned me into an animal.

05:03.500 --> 05:05.767
Hm...

05:07.433 --> 05:09.400
Hm...Hm!

05:14.567 --> 05:17.100
Coloss-O's cereal.

05:18.700 --> 05:21.267
I am evilly delicious.

05:23.167 --> 05:26.367
- BARB: Phoebe, Max,
let's go!

05:26.467 --> 05:28.333
- Actually, I'm off to
the mall with Cherry,

05:28.433 --> 05:30.067
so have fun at Amazing
Land without me. Bye.

05:31.700 --> 05:33.433
- I said I'm off to
the mall with Cherry,

05:33.533 --> 05:34.933
so have fun at Amazing
Land without me. Bye.

05:35.067 --> 05:37.167
- No, Phoebe, you're
coming with us.

05:37.267 --> 05:39.833
You know how important this day
is to Billy and Nora.

05:39.933 --> 05:42.467
- Yeah, but today is
the last day I can...

05:42.567 --> 05:46.067
return this vase.

05:46.133 --> 05:48.167
- We've had that
for six years.

05:48.267 --> 05:50.600
- I'm getting store credit.

05:50.700 --> 05:52.800
- PHOEBE: Oh!

05:54.433 --> 05:55.933
- That was a warning shot.

05:56.067 --> 05:58.467
Next time, you get
a second belly button.

06:00.833 --> 06:04.067
Sorry, I'm just real excited.

06:04.167 --> 06:07.567
- Listen, I would love to go to
Amazing Land, but I can't.

06:07.667 --> 06:09.267
I've got community service.

06:09.367 --> 06:11.533
I have to pick up trash
on the side of the highway.

06:13.833 --> 06:17.833
Done! And I found
a half-eaten granola bar.

06:21.067 --> 06:23.133
- PHOEBE & MAX:

06:23.233 --> 06:24.633
- Guys, stop! I get it.

06:24.733 --> 06:27.600
You guys think hanging out
with your family is lame.

06:27.700 --> 06:29.700
- Yeah, that's it.
- You guys are lame.

06:29.800 --> 06:31.800
- Well, I'm sorry,
but you're going.

06:31.900 --> 06:34.933
And I can guarantee you
this trip is not gonna be lame.

06:35.067 --> 06:37.167
- * Super villain has
the wedgiest tights *

06:37.267 --> 06:39.500
* Wedgiest tights
wedgiest tights *

06:39.600 --> 06:41.867
* Super villain has
the wedgiest tights *

06:41.967 --> 06:44.767
- * 'Cause I kicked him
in the butt *

06:44.867 --> 06:47.600
- HANK & BARB:

06:47.700 --> 06:49.333
- It's bad enough if everyone
knows we're gonna be afraid,

06:49.433 --> 06:52.900
but do we have to listen to this
offensive Super Villain song?

06:53.067 --> 06:56.533
- BILLY: One more time.
* Oh the Super Villain has--

06:56.633 --> 06:59.267
- Billy! You spilled
my chips!

06:59.367 --> 07:00.500
- It was an accident.

07:00.600 --> 07:03.300
I was just feeling the music.

07:03.400 --> 07:05.800
- Ow!

07:05.900 --> 07:07.700
- Hey, kids, come on,
no fighting.

07:07.800 --> 07:09.667
I will turn this car around
and we'll all go home.

07:09.767 --> 07:11.667
I'm as serious as
my limited edition

07:11.767 --> 07:14.067
Thunderman: The Ride hat.

07:17.933 --> 07:20.067
- I don't know what
that means.

07:22.667 --> 07:24.967
Oh, just tell me what
you're trying to say.

07:25.067 --> 07:26.900
- We'll use our powers to trick
Billy and Nora into fighting

07:27.067 --> 07:30.233
so Dad turns the car around
and we save our rep.

07:30.333 --> 07:31.733
- Max, that'll never work.

07:33.267 --> 07:35.367
- Stay on your own side.

07:35.467 --> 07:38.433
- Wow, it worked.
I'll get Nora.

07:40.167 --> 07:42.300
- I didn't. You did.

07:42.400 --> 07:46.700
- MAX & PHOEBE:

07:46.800 --> 07:49.200
- This won't end well.

07:49.300 --> 07:51.733
- Stop it.
- Quit it.

07:54.433 --> 07:56.600
* Hey there, kids,
it's me, Dr. C. *

07:56.700 --> 07:58.867
* With a breakfast treat
that's as good as can be *

07:58.967 --> 08:01.467
* So grab a spoon
and have a taste *

08:01.567 --> 08:03.700
* And shove Coloss-O's
in your face *

08:03.800 --> 08:05.767
- * Coloss-O's
Coloss-O's *

08:05.867 --> 08:07.733
- * It's got raisins
and lotsa healthy junk *

08:07.833 --> 08:10.700
* Now watch the rabbit
shaka shaka his punk *

08:10.800 --> 08:14.700
*

08:14.800 --> 08:17.433
- Wow, business is booming.

08:17.533 --> 08:20.933
My butt can sell anything!

08:21.067 --> 08:22.500
Mm-hm.

08:22.600 --> 08:25.833
- Quit touching me.
- Hey, outta my space.

08:25.933 --> 08:27.700
- You started it.
- You started it.

08:27.800 --> 08:29.733
- Okay, you kids have been
fighting this entire trip.

08:29.833 --> 08:31.600
Why don't you sing
another song?

08:31.700 --> 08:33.067
- Okay.

08:33.167 --> 08:35.067
* Billy's a jerk,
quit touching me *

08:35.133 --> 08:36.933
- * No you're the jerk,
stop touching me *

08:37.067 --> 08:38.933
- Enough!
You kids behave right now

08:39.067 --> 08:41.133
or I will turn
this car around.

08:45.633 --> 08:48.500
- If your dumb foot
touches me again,

08:48.600 --> 08:52.367
I'm gonna laser it right off.

08:52.467 --> 08:54.633
- You wouldn't dare.

08:54.733 --> 08:57.333
- Oh, she would.

08:59.333 --> 09:02.633
- That's it!
- Uh-oh.

09:04.967 --> 09:06.700
Oh, my promotional hat.

09:06.800 --> 09:09.733
That's it--we are going home.

09:12.067 --> 09:14.100
- *

09:14.200 --> 09:17.467
- * Oh we're not going on
Thunderman: The Ride *

09:17.567 --> 09:20.233
* 'Cause my evil plan was evil

09:20.333 --> 09:23.733
Phoebe, second verse,
a little bit worse.

09:23.833 --> 09:27.067
- Oh, it can't get worse.

09:27.167 --> 09:29.133
Should we be worried
about Billy and Nora?

09:29.233 --> 09:31.467
They'll get over this, right?
- Oh, they'll be fine.

09:31.567 --> 09:34.900
Unlike us, those little goobers
actually like each other.

09:35.067 --> 09:36.300
Trust me--they'll walk
through that door

09:36.400 --> 09:37.767
like nothing happened.

09:37.867 --> 09:41.067
- It's your fault we can't
go to Amazing Land.

09:41.133 --> 09:42.400
Apologize.

09:42.500 --> 09:44.600
- Unh-unh.
You need to apologize.

09:44.700 --> 09:46.733
I waited forever to go on
Thunderman: The Ride

09:46.833 --> 09:48.433
and now you've ruined it.

09:48.533 --> 09:49.600
I'm always waiting for you.

09:49.700 --> 09:51.067
- And what's that
supposed to mean?

09:51.167 --> 09:54.733
- Wait till Nora's old enough.
Wait for Nora to catch up.

09:54.833 --> 09:57.133
Wait for Nora to find
the perfect bow.

09:57.233 --> 09:59.367
- You know that's
my signature look.

09:59.467 --> 10:01.167
And you're always
waiting for me

10:01.267 --> 10:03.333
because you can't
do anything without me.

10:03.433 --> 10:04.933
- Starting now, I will.

10:05.033 --> 10:09.167
Watch me break our friendship
frame without you.

10:11.600 --> 10:13.533
- Once again, you need me.

10:16.800 --> 10:18.067
- No, I don't.

10:18.167 --> 10:20.400
In fact, I'm moving
out of our bedroom.

10:20.500 --> 10:24.200
- NORA: Good. I didn't like
sharing a room with you anyway.

10:26.933 --> 10:30.900
- Well, they're still
closer than we are.

10:33.933 --> 10:36.800
- *

10:36.900 --> 10:39.600
- Man, oddly-enough,
for a rabbit,

10:39.700 --> 10:41.400
you make a great cereal.

10:41.500 --> 10:44.133
Ow!

10:44.233 --> 10:45.600
What is this thing?

10:45.700 --> 10:47.733
- That's your tooth.

10:47.833 --> 10:51.800
I dumped a lotta sugar
in that stuff.

10:51.900 --> 10:54.567
- Max, this fight
is getting really bad.

10:54.667 --> 10:57.567
Billy won't even breathe
the same air as Nora.

10:57.667 --> 10:59.067
He's passed out--twice.

10:59.167 --> 11:00.867
We need to tell the truth
and fix this.

11:00.967 --> 11:02.600
You want
people finding out

11:02.700 --> 11:04.600
we're afraid of
an amusement park ride?

11:04.700 --> 11:06.467
- No, but I just feel bad.

11:08.433 --> 11:09.933
You guys should feel bad.

11:10.067 --> 11:12.933
Who's afraid of a silly ride?

11:13.067 --> 11:14.967
- Hey, there's nothing
silly about

11:15.067 --> 11:17.200
being strapped to
a two-ton death machine.

11:19.567 --> 11:22.200
- COLOSSO: Hey, I hope
the rest of your teeth fall out!

11:23.933 --> 11:25.733
- Look, Phoebe,
our secret is safe

11:25.833 --> 11:27.200
and that's all I care about.

11:27.300 --> 11:29.800
What's happening with Billy
and Nora--not my problem.

11:29.900 --> 11:31.600
- BILLY: Incoming!

11:31.700 --> 11:33.433
Ahhhhh!

11:37.867 --> 11:41.600
- I'm moving in, roomie.

11:41.700 --> 11:44.533
- Sure looks like it's
your problem now.

11:44.633 --> 11:49.533
- *

11:49.633 --> 11:51.100
- Eighteen hundred,

11:51.200 --> 11:52.800
nineteen hundred,
two thousand.

11:52.900 --> 11:54.067
Thank you, Colosso.

11:54.133 --> 11:55.767
- Hey, I make things right.

11:55.867 --> 11:58.133
And, Barb, here's 500 bucks.

11:58.233 --> 12:00.167
Buy yourself some
of those yoga pants

12:00.267 --> 12:03.400
you think are okay
to wear in restaurants.

12:03.500 --> 12:07.400
- Apologize, furball, or I'll
wear you to a restaurant.

12:07.500 --> 12:09.167
- Make it 700.

12:12.067 --> 12:14.133
- Apology accepted.

12:15.500 --> 12:17.967
- There's plenty more Colosso
cash where that came from.

12:18.067 --> 12:21.533
Now, let's check this
morning's cereal sales.

12:23.533 --> 12:24.867
"Site under investigation

12:24.967 --> 12:27.767
"by the Federal Bureau
of Cereal Crimes.

12:27.867 --> 12:30.900
This product is known to
cause teeth to fall out."

12:31.067 --> 12:33.533
Lies! Lies, I say!

12:38.100 --> 12:42.367
- *

12:42.467 --> 12:46.500
- Aw, Max, did you start wearing
footie pajamas again?

12:46.600 --> 12:49.700
- Billy was super-speed
sleepwalking last night.

12:54.133 --> 12:57.067
- No. Anyway, I've come
up with a way

12:57.100 --> 12:58.900
to make Billy and Nora
friends again.

12:59.067 --> 13:01.067
You and I act out
a fake fight,

13:01.100 --> 13:02.400
and then we apologize,

13:02.500 --> 13:04.467
reminding them how
siblings should behave.

13:04.567 --> 13:05.967
- Lying. I like it.

13:06.067 --> 13:07.833
- Great. Now I've written
out this script

13:07.933 --> 13:09.633
of how the fight
should go down.

13:09.733 --> 13:11.300
Your character's motivation is--

13:11.400 --> 13:14.767
- To conquer the world
and look good doing it.

13:14.867 --> 13:18.367
- Is it too late
to re

13:18.467 --> 13:22.167
And action!

13:22.267 --> 13:25.567
Max Thunderman, you are
the worst brother ever.

13:25.667 --> 13:28.133
- No, Phoebe,
you are the worst

13:28.233 --> 13:30.733
and I am now quarreling
with you.

13:30.833 --> 13:32.900
Okay, "quarreling"?
No one says that.

13:33.067 --> 13:36.667
- BILLY: I hear quarreling.
What's going on?

13:38.533 --> 13:40.900
- You have wrongly shoved me
and I demand an apology.

13:41.067 --> 13:42.600
- I will not apologize,

13:42.700 --> 13:44.500
for it is you
who has shoved me.

13:44.600 --> 13:46.167
Lookit, how long
is this thing?

13:46.267 --> 13:48.067
- Fine. Just skip
to the apology.

13:48.167 --> 13:49.967
- Before or after
the dance battle?

13:50.067 --> 13:51.467
- After. Page 73.

13:55.367 --> 13:57.833
- What are we doing,
brother Max?

13:57.933 --> 13:59.633
Siblings should not fight.

13:59.733 --> 14:01.733
I am sorry.

14:01.833 --> 14:04.067
- No, I am the sorry
one, Phoebe.

14:04.100 --> 14:06.333
I never should have said
that your face smells

14:06.433 --> 14:10.100
or that you have giraffe--
- Stick to the script.

14:10.200 --> 14:12.267
- Or that your hair clogs
the upstairs shower.

14:12.367 --> 14:15.400
- Okay! I accept
your apology.

14:16.700 --> 14:19.467
- MAX & PHOEBE: Family!

14:19.567 --> 14:21.133
- Here it comes.
- Mm-hm.

14:21.233 --> 14:23.333
- Don't apologize
to her, Max.

14:23.433 --> 14:26.067
She'll just make you
wait for everything.

14:26.167 --> 14:28.933
Sisters and their smelly
faces are the worst.

14:29.067 --> 14:30.300
- No, brothers are.

14:30.400 --> 14:32.067
They can't do anything
by themselves.

14:32.133 --> 14:33.600
They can't even
think for themselves.

14:33.700 --> 14:34.833
- That's not true.

14:34.933 --> 14:38.167
Max, help me think
of a comeback.

14:38.267 --> 14:40.367
- Come on, Phoebe, you can
be my new best friend.

14:40.467 --> 14:42.400
- Yeah, I...I don't think
that's gonna work for me.

14:42.500 --> 14:44.600
- Quiet, new Billy.

14:44.700 --> 14:46.167
- Ow!

14:46.267 --> 14:48.567
- Well, Max is my
new best friend.

14:48.667 --> 14:50.067
Let's go, buddy.

14:50.133 --> 14:52.533
You're thinkin'
for two now.

14:52.633 --> 14:56.733
- *

14:56.833 --> 14:57.867
- I just got off
the phone with

14:57.967 --> 15:02.167
the Federal Bureau
of Cereal Crimes.

15:02.267 --> 15:04.100
Apparently, they're coming
tomorrow to investigate

15:04.200 --> 15:06.300
an illegal cereal operation.

15:06.400 --> 15:09.167
- Max!
- That's what I thought.

15:09.267 --> 15:11.600
So, when I went down
to his lair,

15:11.700 --> 15:15.367
I found 1100 boxes of these.

15:17.167 --> 15:18.733
Where is that rabbit?

15:18.833 --> 15:21.500
- Panama.

15:21.600 --> 15:24.067
Now, Chloe, did you
teleport him there?

15:24.100 --> 15:25.800
- Uh...

15:25.900 --> 15:28.300
Mommy's pretty.
- Oh...

15:28.400 --> 15:33.667
- Chloe, I want you
to take me to Colosso.

15:39.767 --> 15:43.467
You just made
yourself an enemy, kid.

15:43.567 --> 15:46.933
- You just got busted.

15:47.067 --> 15:48.567
- Thanks to you, Colosso,

15:48.667 --> 15:50.567
the cereal police are coming
to my house tomorrow.

15:50.667 --> 15:54.500
- Evidently, your homemade
cereal causes severe tooth loss

15:54.600 --> 15:57.800
and the raisins
aren't really raisins.

15:59.300 --> 16:01.167
Colosso, what did you do?

16:01.267 --> 16:04.433
- You mean, what did
I doo

16:06.633 --> 16:09.600
- *

16:14.133 --> 16:16.100
- I'm done playing
with Nora.

16:16.200 --> 16:17.900
Her shooting lasers
and me yelling "Ouch"

16:18.067 --> 16:21.167
is only fun for one person!

16:21.267 --> 16:23.167
What's with
the walkie

16:23.267 --> 16:25.100
- Gotta feed Billy thoughts.

16:25.200 --> 16:26.567
- BILLY: Max, come in.

16:26.667 --> 16:27.767
I can't see.

16:27.867 --> 16:30.867
- Turn the lights on, buddy.

16:30.967 --> 16:32.700
- BILLY: Good thinking, Max.

16:32.800 --> 16:34.367
- I don't care, Colosso.

16:34.467 --> 16:36.233
You're going back
in your cage.

16:36.333 --> 16:37.400
And don't ever use Chloe

16:37.500 --> 16:39.600
to teleport you anywhere
ever again.

16:46.067 --> 16:47.867
Chloe can teleport
with other people.

16:49.200 --> 16:51.633
I haven't been walking
to school in two weeks.

16:51.733 --> 16:54.300
- BILLY: Max, there's
something on my head.

16:54.400 --> 16:57.633
- That's your hair, champ.

16:57.733 --> 17:00.200
We can use Chloe to teleport

17:00.300 --> 17:01.900
Billy and Nora
to Amazing Land,

17:02.067 --> 17:03.433
and if we can get
them on that ride,

17:03.533 --> 17:05.067
they'll forget
why they're mad.

17:05.167 --> 17:08.667
- NORA: Phoebe, it's time
to play "Ouch."

17:08.767 --> 17:10.467
- Oh, no, she found me.

17:10.567 --> 17:13.300
Okay, find Billy and Chloe
and meet me in the driveway.

17:17.300 --> 17:19.433
- PHOEBE: Ahh!

17:19.533 --> 17:26.200
- *

17:26.300 --> 17:27.700
- All right, Chloe says
she's ready

17:27.800 --> 17:29.200
to take us to Amazing Land.

17:29.300 --> 17:31.200
- Buckle up, baby.

17:31.300 --> 17:32.833
- Let's do this, Max.

17:39.100 --> 17:42.567
- Now, Chloe!
- To Amazing Land!

17:46.267 --> 17:50.867
- Whoa. How'd you get Amazing
Land in our driveway?

17:50.967 --> 17:53.833
- We're at Amazing Land,
old Billy.

17:53.933 --> 17:57.333
I'm so glad I don't have
to deal with that anymore.

17:57.433 --> 18:00.867
- Hey, Chloe, why don't
you go wait over by Thunderman?

18:00.967 --> 18:03.900
- That's Daddy!

18:04.067 --> 18:06.200
- Okay, now we brought you
guys here after hours

18:06.300 --> 18:07.800
so you can make up.

18:07.900 --> 18:09.833
So...

18:09.933 --> 18:12.433
here's Thunderman: The Ride.

18:12.533 --> 18:14.367
Come on, hurry up
and hop on

18:14.467 --> 18:16.367
and you guys can be
friends again.

18:16.467 --> 18:18.267
It'll be great.
Come on.

18:18.367 --> 18:19.900
Yay, we're two riding.

18:20.067 --> 18:21.200
- Come on, guys.

18:21.300 --> 18:22.800
Then, Billy, you can
move outta my lair

18:22.900 --> 18:26.533
and, Nora, no disrespect,
you can do whatever you want.

18:26.633 --> 18:28.067
- No way I'm gonna
ride that with him

18:28.100 --> 18:29.667
until he apologizes.

18:29.767 --> 18:32.467
- Of course. Let's
all wait for Nora.

18:32.567 --> 18:36.100
Wait. Wait. Wait.
Wait. Wait.

18:36.200 --> 18:37.633
- Max, we need to do

18:37.733 --> 18:39.400
what we should have done
in the first place.

18:39.500 --> 18:41.167
- Don't you say it.
- Tell the truth.

18:41.267 --> 18:42.767
- You're so weak.

18:42.867 --> 18:45.133
- NORA & BILLY: I'm never
talking to you again!

18:45.233 --> 18:48.200
- Wait, guys.
You can't go.

18:48.300 --> 18:51.467
Look, Billy, you never
kicked Nora

18:51.567 --> 18:54.800
and, Nora, you never
shoved Billy.

18:54.900 --> 18:56.300
We did.

18:56.400 --> 18:57.667
- Okay, look, the truth is

18:57.767 --> 19:00.700
Max and I are afraid of riding
Thunderman: The Ride.

19:00.800 --> 19:03.633
It's just so terrifying
with the up and the down

19:03.733 --> 19:05.567
and the barfing.

19:05.667 --> 19:07.700
- And we didn't want our
secret shame to get out,

19:07.800 --> 19:10.400
so we used our superpowers to
trick you guys into fighting,

19:10.500 --> 19:12.633
so Dad would turn
the car around.

19:15.633 --> 19:17.800
- Because you wanted to
keep your secret?

19:17.900 --> 19:20.233
- Yeah.

19:20.333 --> 19:22.100
We're sorry.

19:22.200 --> 19:24.300
- We have to talk
about this.

19:28.300 --> 19:30.267
- Look, Max, it's working.

19:30.367 --> 19:32.533
- I'll never forgive you.

19:32.633 --> 19:34.467
- Great, you jinxed it.

19:36.867 --> 19:41.167
Hey, Nora, it's okay.

19:41.267 --> 19:42.467
Don't cry.

19:42.567 --> 19:44.233
- NORA: I'm not crying.

19:44.333 --> 19:46.867
I'm laughing.

19:46.967 --> 19:48.367
Now, Billy!

19:50.067 --> 19:53.767
- Oh, just a little payback.

19:55.733 --> 19:58.367
- HANK'S RECORDED VOICE:
Prepare for blast off.

19:58.467 --> 20:00.067
- We apologized and all
that garbage.

20:00.167 --> 20:02.000
You can't do this.

20:02.100 --> 20:03.833
- Watch us.

20:03.933 --> 20:05.200
- HANK: Five, four, three...

20:05.300 --> 20:07.200
- Break the rule
and hold me.

20:07.300 --> 20:09.033
- Only if you hold me.

20:09.133 --> 20:13.367
- HANK: Thunderman, away!

20:15.267 --> 20:17.300
- Bye-bye.

20:19.400 --> 20:21.867
- Sorry about what
I said earlier.

20:21.967 --> 20:23.400
- No, you were right.

20:23.500 --> 20:25.367
I can't do anything
without you--

20:25.467 --> 20:28.300
because I have so much fun
doing everything with you.

20:28.400 --> 20:29.500
- Me, too.

20:29.600 --> 20:31.300
That's always why I make
you wait for me--

20:31.400 --> 20:33.867
so we can do fun stuff
like this together.

20:39.567 --> 20:42.133
- We're not really gonna
ride this thing, are we?

20:42.233 --> 20:45.000
- Absolutely not.
They look terrified.

20:52.100 --> 20:55.367
- Now that's a scream face.

20:55.467 --> 20:59.133
- It really captures
their fear and shame.

20:59.233 --> 21:01.800
Good call in making them
ride it 20 times.

21:06.267 --> 21:09.067
Come on, let's go put
this in our room.

21:09.100 --> 21:11.533
- BILLY & NORA: Family!

21:14.633 --> 21:16.600
- I'm really sorry.

21:16.700 --> 21:20.067
I had no idea it was illegal to
make cereal in my basement.

21:20.100 --> 21:25.400
But $5,000. That seems
like a pretty steep fine.

21:25.500 --> 21:29.067
Would you take
a bunny instead?

21:29.167 --> 21:30.467
- You know, some day

21:30.567 --> 21:32.333
I'm sure we'll look
back on this and laugh.

21:32.433 --> 21:35.500
- I'll be laughing,
you will be screaming.

21:35.600 --> 21:37.567
- Hey! Hey! Come on!

21:37.667 --> 21:38.800
Whoa! Oh!

21:38.900 --> 21:43.533
Ohhhhhhhhh!

21:46.900 --> 21:48.600
Hi, I'm Dr. Colosso.

21:48.700 --> 21:50.867
You know, we had a lotta
laughs here today.

21:50.967 --> 21:53.667
But there's one thing
that's no laughing matter--

21:53.767 --> 21:55.067
tooth decay.

21:55.133 --> 21:57.300
So, it's important to brush
your teeth after every meal

21:57.400 --> 22:00.500
with a doctor-recommended
toothpaste like mine--

22:00.600 --> 22:03.900
Dr. Coloss-O's toothpaste.

22:04.067 --> 22:05.600
Now in raisin flavor.

22:05.700 --> 22:07.833
- HANK: Colosso!
- Uh-oh.

22:10.900 --> 22:26.233
- *
