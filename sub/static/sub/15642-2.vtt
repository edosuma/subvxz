00:01.084 --> 00:02.802
<i>Previously on Hit the Floor:</i>

00:02.961 --> 00:05.259
If people found out,
that'd be it for me.

00:05.380 --> 00:08.224
I want you,
but we have to keep it a secret.

00:08.342 --> 00:11.186
Remember that Ohio small forward?
I bought him.

00:11.303 --> 00:13.931
- Zero, Pete.
- And one, two.

00:14.097 --> 00:16.896
- Jelena Howard, Captain.
- Sloane Hayes, Director.

00:17.059 --> 00:19.437
- This is a business.
- I know how you do business.

00:19.728 --> 00:21.275
- Isn't that...?
- My wife.

00:21.438 --> 00:24.317
Until our divorce,
those seats are 50 per cent mine.

00:24.733 --> 00:27.486
You are the sexiest woman
I've ever laid eye on.

00:27.653 --> 00:29.326
I'm way too much woman for you.

00:29.738 --> 00:33.914
- How do I come up with 350 grand?
- Who are these dudes?

00:34.076 --> 00:37.296
- High rollers that come to games.
- A good place to start.

00:37.704 --> 00:42.380
If you keep playing, you could blow out
your knee. It will end your career.

00:42.793 --> 00:44.636
- Good luck with your cheerleaders.
- They're dancers.

00:44.795 --> 00:46.217
Great.

00:46.380 --> 00:49.350
Olivia's planning on showing up
at the ground-breaking.

00:49.508 --> 00:52.227
If she does something stupid,
I'm holding you responsible.

00:53.845 --> 00:56.724
And so it is with great pride
that I break ground

00:56.890 --> 00:59.609
on the Devils' new Hollywood arena.

00:59.768 --> 01:01.065
Olivia.

01:17.494 --> 01:18.791
Over this way, please.

01:18.954 --> 01:22.458
Chase, any comment?
Any comment about your wife's murder?

01:24.126 --> 01:27.972
My wife was an amazing woman.
She was the love of my life.

01:28.589 --> 01:32.310
I'm gonna make sure whoever did this,
feels the pain I'm going through.

01:32.467 --> 01:34.595
<i>That's former Devils player
Chase Vincent</i>

01:34.761 --> 01:36.934
<i>making a statement
about his wife's death.</i>

01:37.097 --> 01:40.101
<i>Her body was discovered yesterday
on the construction site</i>

01:40.267 --> 01:42.690
<i>for the new Devils arena in Hollywood.</i>

01:42.853 --> 01:45.572
<i>Police have no suspects in custody
at this time.</i>

01:48.191 --> 01:49.909
Don't.

01:50.360 --> 01:53.830
- Don't get too caught up in the circus.
- How can I not?

01:53.989 --> 01:57.619
There are reporters swarming outside,
there are cops swarming inside.

01:57.743 --> 01:59.837
It's surreal.

02:06.043 --> 02:10.719
- I don't know if you can run away.
- I saw her. In the ground. I saw her.

02:10.881 --> 02:14.351
Hey, hey. Come here. Come here.

02:14.801 --> 02:19.181
Sorry to interrupt. Boss Mum's rounding
up the dancers for a heart-to-heart.

02:19.306 --> 02:21.684
OK. Thanks. Be there in a sec.

02:21.850 --> 02:25.024
This door locks. Just FYI.

02:25.854 --> 02:29.950
- We need to be more careful about this.
- You mean us? We're careful enough.

02:30.067 --> 02:33.537
- We're not. Someone just walked in.
- Kyle already knows.

02:33.695 --> 02:35.823
- What if it was anyone else?
- It wasn't.

02:35.989 --> 02:38.788
Dancers can't date players.
I can't lose my job.

02:38.950 --> 02:41.203
So when outside your house,
there's no us.

02:41.370 --> 02:45.000
No touching, no holding hands.
From now on, we keep our distance.

02:45.165 --> 02:47.213
- Look, Ahsha...
- I've gotta go.

02:52.297 --> 02:56.643
What happened to Olivia,
it's unthinkable.

02:57.427 --> 02:59.930
Not something you just shake off.

03:00.305 --> 03:05.562
So if any of you need to talk,
I'm here.

03:05.936 --> 03:08.985
For now, I think it's best
if we cancel today's rehearsal

03:09.106 --> 03:13.532
as well as tomorrow night's performance
at the L.A. County Museum of Art.

03:16.446 --> 03:18.323
A word?

03:26.039 --> 03:27.757
We're not cancelling.

03:29.167 --> 03:32.091
First, we don't make my decisions.

03:32.254 --> 03:35.133
Second, I know you and Olivia
didn't exactly get along,

03:35.298 --> 03:39.804
but you can understand we shouldn't be
out there doing high-kicks right now.

03:39.970 --> 03:43.850
Olivia and I had our differences but she
would never cancel a performance.

03:44.015 --> 03:45.312
It's respectful.

03:45.475 --> 03:47.819
Respectful is doing
what she would've wanted.

03:47.978 --> 03:51.027
The Devil Girls have never missed
an appearance.

03:53.066 --> 03:57.492
You may not feel anything, Jelena,
but Olivia was murdered.

03:57.654 --> 04:00.157
This is hardly
a "show must go on" situation.

04:00.323 --> 04:02.667
Don't presume to know how I feel.

04:02.784 --> 04:05.162
- You're too close to this.
- Excuse me?

04:05.787 --> 04:08.131
You took the woman's job.

04:08.540 --> 04:10.542
Your guilt is affecting
your judgment.

04:12.794 --> 04:15.798
Having the girls dance now
makes the wrong statement.

04:15.964 --> 04:17.966
Either way, we make a statement.

04:18.132 --> 04:21.137
- Only one's gonna make Oscar happy.
- Oscar?

04:21.261 --> 04:23.889
He wants the city to know
that we're still strong.

04:24.055 --> 04:27.400
But if you want him thinking
you're weak...

04:33.607 --> 04:36.656
- Do the police have a suspect?
- Not yet.

04:36.860 --> 04:40.034
It's just terrible.
It hits me right here in my heart.

04:40.197 --> 04:43.497
This is a PR nightmare.
My build site's a crime scene.

04:43.658 --> 04:47.629
The city's shut down construction.
My $2 billion construction.

04:47.746 --> 04:49.874
I've been on the phone
with my investors.

04:50.040 --> 04:54.591
- You'll figure something out.
- I need a hand, Jude, not a hand-job.

04:54.753 --> 04:58.053
I have to go to this LACMA thing,
show my face. The media...

04:58.215 --> 05:00.593
- The media's something else.
- What can I do?

05:01.301 --> 05:02.644
Get the word out.

05:02.803 --> 05:05.522
Anyone divulging Devils business
will be dealt with.

05:05.680 --> 05:08.604
- Can you handle that?
- Absolutely.

05:09.935 --> 05:13.109
Yeah.
Well, that's just terrific, isn't it?

05:17.859 --> 05:21.864
Someone was obviously sending
Oscar a message burying Olivia there.

05:22.030 --> 05:24.499
Oscar's been funnelling money
into this project

05:24.658 --> 05:26.877
by getting his investors
to bet on games.

05:27.035 --> 05:29.788
Fixing the point spread,
using casinos as middle men.

05:29.955 --> 05:32.128
Plenty of people
he could've pissed off.

05:32.290 --> 05:35.464
They could've chosen anyone
to send that message. Why Olivia?

05:35.627 --> 05:39.473
Add her to the long list of bad things
that happen around Oscar Kinkade.

05:40.423 --> 05:44.894
Well, all the security clearances
I got were revoked. Everyone's was.

05:45.053 --> 05:47.897
There's new passwords, firewalls...

05:48.056 --> 05:50.855
Because of what happened,
Oscar has the arena on lock.

05:51.017 --> 05:54.317
Yeah.
The league lost all our ways in too.

05:54.479 --> 05:57.699
What I'm trying to do just went
from difficult to impossible.

05:57.858 --> 06:02.409
Or this might be the best thing that
could've happened to our investigation.

06:02.571 --> 06:03.868
How can you say that?

06:04.030 --> 06:07.785
Something this big doesn't go down
without kicking up new dirt.

06:07.951 --> 06:10.955
Oscar just lost control,
and you are now the one person

06:11.121 --> 06:13.544
in the one place
to take advantage of it.

06:23.967 --> 06:25.264
No "thank you"?

06:25.427 --> 06:28.806
If I thanked everyone who held
a door for me, I'd have no voice.

06:28.972 --> 06:31.942
- I'll remember that on our date.
- Agreeing to that date

06:32.100 --> 06:36.071
- was for Terrence's benefit, not yours.
- I don't care who you said it for.

06:36.229 --> 06:37.947
You said yes.

06:38.064 --> 06:41.489
This is gonna happen.
So dinner at The Ivy?

06:41.651 --> 06:44.951
Or I can just hire Wolfgang Puck
to cook for us at my mansion.

06:45.113 --> 06:46.865
I'm worth millions.

06:47.032 --> 06:50.787
I don't know if you've heard,
but that doesn't impress me.

06:51.953 --> 06:55.423
Sorry, Junior, you're not tall enough
to ride this ride.

06:57.250 --> 07:00.504
You really think Terrence Wall's
the only one who deserves you?

07:00.670 --> 07:04.641
Mark my words. By the end of the week,
we're going out on a date.

07:06.176 --> 07:08.725
Because of what's going on,
I won't get a chance

07:08.887 --> 07:11.185
to explain everything
you're gonna be doing.

07:11.306 --> 07:14.276
- I can come back.
- Go find a film for the entire season

07:14.434 --> 07:17.313
study it, learn it,
then give me your take on defence.

07:17.479 --> 07:20.699
- Got it. Where should I set up?
- Right here.

07:31.409 --> 07:34.959
- We need our first target.
- Maybe you should find a newspaper.

07:35.121 --> 07:36.873
Someone's dead.

07:37.165 --> 07:39.133
Well, life goes on.

07:39.459 --> 07:42.429
Unless you wanna be Mrs Benny Wise
the rest of your life?

07:42.545 --> 07:44.639
I cannot afford to be tied to that man.

07:44.798 --> 07:47.347
He spends more time in a courtroom
than Dateline.

07:50.261 --> 07:51.979
Him.

07:52.138 --> 07:54.140
OK, who's Teddy Reynolds?

07:54.265 --> 07:56.688
Easy mark.
We already had some fun together.

07:56.851 --> 08:00.230
- Where?
- In Terrence Wall's locker.

08:02.190 --> 08:05.740
His daddy runs a movie studio.
Heard he just gave him a slush fund.

08:05.860 --> 08:09.080
Development money to make him think
he's a big-time producer.

08:09.489 --> 08:13.084
Teddy's been buying lots of garbage
he's not doing a damn thing with.

08:13.243 --> 08:16.087
- Like what?
- Well, he bought the rights to Pez.

08:16.246 --> 08:19.591
Not the dispensers, just the candy.
That should be a good one.

08:19.791 --> 08:21.259
Yeah.

08:22.085 --> 08:24.338
A moviemaker who makes nothing.

08:24.879 --> 08:26.631
That's something I can work with.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.761
You wanted to see me?

08:35.765 --> 08:37.813
How you holding up?

08:38.559 --> 08:42.155
- Have you talked to your mother?
- Not really.

08:46.860 --> 08:51.787
Listen, Sloane and Olivia,
their relationship was...

08:51.948 --> 08:53.791
It was complicated.

08:54.325 --> 08:58.876
So, it might not be a bad idea
if you tried to be there for her.

09:00.749 --> 09:02.877
That's not why you wanted to see me.

09:04.586 --> 09:10.514
I wish the timing was better, but I don't
want you to hear it from anybody else.

09:12.427 --> 09:14.304
I'm seeing Raquel.

09:15.930 --> 09:19.935
- Raquel. "Raquel" Raquel?
- "Raquel" Raquel.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.646
But weren't you just with my mum?

09:24.105 --> 09:26.608
When Sloane and I

09:26.775 --> 09:28.869
reconnected, it brought up

09:29.444 --> 09:31.617
old feelings for both of us.

09:33.156 --> 09:39.254
But we didn't work back then,
and we just don't work now.

09:40.288 --> 09:42.882
With Raquel,
we don't have all that baggage.

09:43.041 --> 09:45.510
It just feels nice.

09:54.469 --> 09:56.096
Is Raquel happy?

09:58.181 --> 10:00.024
I think so.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.569
Because she deserves to be.

10:05.313 --> 10:07.031
I know.

10:08.775 --> 10:10.197
Good.

10:11.778 --> 10:13.997
- Good?
- Good.

10:15.365 --> 10:16.912
Good.

10:37.595 --> 10:40.348
So you decided not to cancel
the dance.

10:40.849 --> 10:43.819
Well, it was important to Oscar.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.729
Thanks for rebounding so quickly.

10:47.021 --> 10:49.399
We're ready. Are you ready?

10:50.817 --> 10:54.196
- Yeah, I think I got it covered.
- Olivia always double-checked

10:54.362 --> 10:56.456
how much space we'd need
for the routine

10:56.614 --> 10:58.537
against the floor plan of the venue.

10:58.700 --> 11:00.452
Have you done that?

11:01.995 --> 11:03.668
No.

11:04.581 --> 11:06.208
I think the floor plan's M.l.A.

11:06.374 --> 11:11.551
You'll get one later. For now,
I'll mark the dance, you tape it. OK?

11:12.589 --> 11:14.262
OK.

11:14.966 --> 11:16.809
OK, so...

11:23.057 --> 11:25.025
We go about this far stage left.

11:25.143 --> 11:28.192
I'm sorry,
where did the first count start?

11:28.354 --> 11:29.697
Want me to do it again?

11:40.992 --> 11:43.586
- How's your girl?
- What are you talking about?

11:45.622 --> 11:49.092
The one I saw you walking out with
the other day.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.169
Not totally offensive-looking.

11:51.920 --> 11:54.594
It seems like you've zeroed-in
on someone new.

11:54.756 --> 11:58.556
Unless I wasn't supposed to hear
the date you made in front of my face?

11:58.718 --> 12:00.971
Don't flatter yourself.

12:01.137 --> 12:04.141
You said you wanted me
to have a nice life.

12:04.349 --> 12:06.693
This is what it looks like.

12:15.860 --> 12:18.534
- Lionel.
- How are you, Pete?

12:19.113 --> 12:21.912
- What are you doing here?
- Well, there was a death.

12:22.075 --> 12:25.670
- Checking on people is thing to do.
- I'm fine.

12:26.871 --> 12:29.499
- How's Chase? You talk to him?
- Why do you care?

12:29.624 --> 12:31.877
We used to socialise
with Olivia and Chase.

12:32.043 --> 12:34.421
- They've come to our house.
- You hated them.

12:34.587 --> 12:37.841
You said Olivia was duller
than her natural hair colour.

12:38.007 --> 12:40.009
That doesn't make this
any less tragic.

12:40.176 --> 12:43.055
I don't need you coming here
and checking in on me, OK?

12:43.221 --> 12:45.144
I have someone.
We check on each other.

12:45.265 --> 12:48.314
- Girl from the bar? Waitress? Rachel?
- Raquel.

12:48.476 --> 12:51.104
And she's not a waitress,
she manages the club.

12:51.271 --> 12:54.366
She can't be that important
if you're keeping her a secret.

12:54.524 --> 12:56.652
- That'll change tonight.
- Why's that?

12:56.818 --> 12:59.617
See, one of the nice things
about you and I divorcing,

12:59.779 --> 13:02.578
I don't have to answer
your questions anymore.

13:15.211 --> 13:17.885
- Hey.
- Hi.

13:18.047 --> 13:19.970
My dad told me
you were working here.

13:20.133 --> 13:23.137
I still can't believe it.
Me, coaching for the Devils.

13:24.178 --> 13:26.272
You worked hard for this.

13:26.431 --> 13:31.107
Ahsha, I know I wouldn't be here
if you hadn't given it your okay, so...

13:32.270 --> 13:33.692
Thank you.

13:33.855 --> 13:37.860
I'd never get in the way of your dream.
You've never got in the way of mine.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.451
Coach, Coach.

13:47.285 --> 13:50.664
- Welcome to the show, big baller.
- Derek.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.878
This is gonna be great.

13:53.041 --> 13:55.635
Now you get to watch
the magic up close.

13:56.294 --> 13:58.467
I'm excited.

13:59.714 --> 14:01.216
Good seeing you, Ahsha.

14:05.678 --> 14:07.146
- What was that?
- What?

14:07.263 --> 14:11.484
Did you not hear me yesterday?
You can't just rub up on me in public.

14:11.642 --> 14:15.567
- I was saying hi to the new guy.
- You were being a dick to the new guy.

14:15.855 --> 14:19.029
- Why did your dad hire him?
- My dad doesn't know about us.

14:19.192 --> 14:21.115
He knows dude punched me
in the face.

14:21.277 --> 14:23.700
Why would your gym teacher
even take this job?

14:23.821 --> 14:27.871
German doesn't have the same
opportunities that you do, Derek.

14:28.701 --> 14:30.669
I need you to be OK with this.

14:30.828 --> 14:34.878
- Please, for me, for now.
- OK. No problem.

14:35.041 --> 14:37.294
All right, I'll play nice, I promise.

14:48.596 --> 14:50.143
Raquel.

14:53.684 --> 14:57.609
Peter. Glad you could make it
on such short notice.

14:57.772 --> 14:59.866
We need to put on
our best face tonight.

14:59.982 --> 15:03.703
Yes, that's why I invited Raquel,
as my date.

15:07.907 --> 15:12.834
- Are you crazy? Ahsha...
- She knows. I told her.

15:12.995 --> 15:16.750
She cared more about you being happy
than me being happy.

15:22.004 --> 15:26.555
Glad you could make it, Lionel.
You look stunning, as usual.

15:26.717 --> 15:28.310
Thank you, Oscar.

15:28.469 --> 15:30.563
I hear we may start seeing
you at games.

15:30.721 --> 15:33.144
I can't tell you how delighted
that'd make me.

15:33.266 --> 15:35.268
Would you excuse me?
Just for a minute.

15:35.435 --> 15:36.812
Of course.

15:42.650 --> 15:44.823
Lionel. Wow, you look--

15:44.944 --> 15:48.494
Oscar heard I'll be coming to all
the games the rest of the season.

15:48.656 --> 15:50.909
What was the condition
for that happening?

15:51.075 --> 15:55.330
- No Pete and Raquel.
- And what is that right there?

15:55.496 --> 15:58.295
- Pete and Raquel.
- I wasn't sitting courtside while

15:58.458 --> 16:00.836
he was screwing another woman
on the down-low.

16:01.002 --> 16:03.926
I'm not sitting there
while he's screwing her in public.

16:04.088 --> 16:07.137
- I'm not taking that kind of a press hit.
- I'll fix it.

16:07.300 --> 16:10.930
In the meantime, I'm leaving.
Tell Oscar goodbye for me, would you?

16:15.391 --> 16:18.270
Ladies, OK. Ready?

16:18.436 --> 16:20.109
Beautiful. Beautiful.

16:22.940 --> 16:24.863
Don't you just hate PDAs?

16:28.237 --> 16:31.241
They do make a good-looking couple,
though.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.843
OK, ladies.

16:56.807 --> 16:59.686
<i>Don't know what you think you saw</i>

16:59.852 --> 17:02.651
<i>You didn't know at all</i>

17:02.813 --> 17:06.282
<i>Lost sight of who you are</i>

17:07.859 --> 17:09.156
<i>No, no</i>

17:09.319 --> 17:11.539
<i>Can I make a connection?</i>

17:12.281 --> 17:14.829
<i>Force myself in a dimension?</i>

17:15.451 --> 17:19.957
<i>Lost sight of myself</i>

17:20.330 --> 17:22.049
<i>No, no</i>

17:22.208 --> 17:25.051
<i>If I could force my heart
My ears, my mind</i>

17:25.211 --> 17:27.634
<i>And eyes to get in line</i>

17:28.172 --> 17:32.302
<i>Maybe I'd find something real
Not a fantasy so divine</i>

17:33.010 --> 17:35.104
<i>Let myself down each time</i>

17:36.222 --> 17:38.350
<i>Let myself down each time</i>

17:40.726 --> 17:45.726
<i>How could you be
What I wanna see?</i>

17:54.073 --> 17:56.622
<i>When my reality</i>

17:56.742 --> 18:00.246
<i>Could never live up
Could never live up</i>

18:00.413 --> 18:03.087
<i>To the fantasy</i>

18:29.942 --> 18:34.942
<i>How could you be
What I wanna see?</i>

18:43.331 --> 18:45.880
<i>When my reality</i>

18:46.042 --> 18:49.012
<i>Could never live up
Could never live up</i>

18:49.170 --> 18:52.515
<i>To the fantasy</i>

19:08.689 --> 19:11.533
Sarah, hi. Sloane Hayes.

19:11.692 --> 19:13.990
I'm so glad you could come.

19:14.445 --> 19:18.541
- So, how you holding up?
- I'm not.

19:19.116 --> 19:20.459
I still can't believe it.

19:22.036 --> 19:23.538
Listen.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.540
I know you quit after Olivia left,

19:25.665 --> 19:30.341
but I could sure use a good assistant.
Someone who knew all her ins and outs.

19:30.461 --> 19:32.429
I didn't quit. Oscar fired me.

19:34.340 --> 19:36.183
I'm sorry.

19:36.759 --> 19:40.229
I really could've used you.
I can't find even the simplest thing.

19:40.346 --> 19:41.973
Her desktop has nothing on it.

19:42.139 --> 19:45.188
- Oscar had it wiped clean.
- Why would he do that?

19:45.351 --> 19:47.149
I think it was just to spite her.

19:47.311 --> 19:51.612
He said she resigned, but she didn't.
He let her go.

19:51.774 --> 19:54.948
Probably why she was planning
to come to the ground-breaking.

19:55.111 --> 19:57.705
- To chew him out.
- She planned on being there?

20:00.908 --> 20:05.084
- Well, good luck to you Sarah.
- You too.

20:10.793 --> 20:13.387
Hope you don't mind
I'm still in my work clothes.

20:13.504 --> 20:16.804
I had a Devils event tonight
and didn't get a chance to change.

20:16.966 --> 20:19.594
I skipped out on the after-party
just for you.

20:20.177 --> 20:21.599
I don't mind.

20:21.762 --> 20:25.141
It's just another amazing night
in my little old life story.

20:34.024 --> 20:35.651
They're blank.

20:35.818 --> 20:40.073
When I procure rights,
there's usually a logline, a treatment...

20:41.407 --> 20:42.829
When I bought Lucky Charms,

20:42.992 --> 20:45.211
there was a box
with a maze on the back.

20:46.829 --> 20:49.708
That was awesome. I finished it too.

20:54.128 --> 20:58.929
If you're willing to pay $50,000
for the rights to my life story,

20:59.091 --> 21:01.469
I thought it'd be better
if I just showed you.

21:03.512 --> 21:08.359
This is the story of a small-town girl,

21:09.101 --> 21:10.728
the daughter of a preacher,

21:10.895 --> 21:14.570
who takes over Hollywood,
one star at a time.

21:18.611 --> 21:20.955
This is a pretty good story.

21:21.113 --> 21:23.957
I recently spent some time
with a couple of actors.

21:24.116 --> 21:29.464
Now, I can't name names,
but let's just say they were brothers,

21:29.580 --> 21:31.833
and only one of them
was an Avenger.

21:35.294 --> 21:38.264
He let me hold his hammer, Teddy.
You like to hammer?

21:40.174 --> 21:43.644
- I like to hammer, Kyle?
- Yeah? Yes? Yeah? Are you in, Teddy?

21:43.803 --> 21:45.396
- I'm in.
- Oh, yes.

21:45.554 --> 21:47.682
- I'm in.
- Yes.

21:50.059 --> 21:51.606
Get away from her.

21:54.021 --> 21:55.364
There's been a mistake.

21:55.523 --> 21:57.651
- You bet your ass.
- What are you doing?

21:57.817 --> 21:59.819
He was hurting you.
You were screaming.

21:59.944 --> 22:02.038
I'm not the quiet type.

22:03.906 --> 22:06.705
You're an investment.
I was protecting my investment.

22:06.826 --> 22:08.419
This is why I work alone.

22:11.080 --> 22:13.082
Goddamn.

22:14.500 --> 22:19.051
I prayed and God gave me a vision.

22:19.213 --> 22:22.968
You and me naked on a beach
under the stars.

22:23.133 --> 22:25.886
My private jet's waiting
to fly us to Cabo right now.

22:27.221 --> 22:29.474
Tweet me the pics.

22:33.143 --> 22:37.148
- Pete. There you are.
- Oscar need me for something?

22:37.314 --> 22:41.490
Actually, I do. There's a certain female
I wanted to talk to you about.

22:41.652 --> 22:44.872
Someone I got my eye on. Sloane.

22:46.323 --> 22:48.041
Sloane?

22:48.200 --> 22:50.328
- What about her?
- Is she single?

22:53.372 --> 22:55.500
You'd have to ask her that.

22:55.624 --> 22:57.922
I heard she was pretty wild
back in the day.

22:58.085 --> 22:59.632
You both were.

22:59.795 --> 23:03.095
Yeah, well,
that was a long time ago, Jude.

23:03.257 --> 23:05.476
- Excuse me.
- I'm serious.

23:05.634 --> 23:07.261
From what I've picked up,

23:07.428 --> 23:09.772
she's not qualified
for that director's gig,

23:09.930 --> 23:14.106
so she had to do something for Oscar
to get it.

23:14.935 --> 23:16.562
I might have some work for her.

23:23.986 --> 23:25.533
Satisfied? He's gone.

23:25.696 --> 23:29.291
I think you owe me an apology.
You were very mean to me back there.

23:29.450 --> 23:32.875
You know, I had him on the hook.
Now he's running around town

23:33.037 --> 23:36.632
with a crazy story about Kyle Hart,
and that's not good for business.

23:36.790 --> 23:40.545
I need to fix this. And I can't tomorrow
because I got Olivia's funeral.

23:42.963 --> 23:44.715
What?

23:53.140 --> 23:55.359
Hey, Teddy. It's Kyle.

23:55.517 --> 23:57.940
Listen, darling,
I am so sorry about that guy.

23:58.062 --> 24:01.111
He is just someone
I know who went off his meds.

24:01.649 --> 24:03.947
You have to let me make it up to you.

24:05.277 --> 24:09.908
How would you like a real
once-in-a-lifetime Devils experience?

24:10.950 --> 24:13.453
All the players are gonna be there.

24:16.330 --> 24:18.207
Jelena.

24:21.043 --> 24:23.216
You need a ride?

24:25.756 --> 24:29.511
If I didn't get into
your understated Escalade,

24:29.677 --> 24:33.272
what makes you think I'm getting
into this ostentatious Aston Martin?

24:33.430 --> 24:35.478
Well, from what I heard...

24:37.309 --> 24:40.779
...this is exactly what you'd wanna
pull up to Olivia's funeral in.

24:50.280 --> 24:54.626
<i>I go, I drink
I ball so much, I can't think</i>

25:18.976 --> 25:21.024
- You OK?
- What are you doing here?

25:21.145 --> 25:23.694
An extra set of eyes couldn't hurt.

25:29.111 --> 25:33.241
Sorry for your loss, Chase.
Olivia was a rare woman.

25:42.249 --> 25:45.469
- Looks like he pissed someone off.
- Yeah, me.

25:45.586 --> 25:47.179
You did that?

25:47.337 --> 25:49.715
You gave Oscar's son a black eye?

25:49.882 --> 25:52.476
Oscar's never been
very protective of him.

25:53.302 --> 25:55.225
You wouldn't believe
what he was saying.

25:55.554 --> 25:57.431
About what?

25:57.723 --> 25:59.691
Sloane.

26:09.485 --> 26:13.080
- Nice shiner.
- See how far I'll go for you?

26:14.073 --> 26:16.417
Apparently not far enough.

26:16.700 --> 26:18.418
Give it time.

26:32.966 --> 26:36.391
- You brought me to a funeral?
- Not any funeral.

26:36.553 --> 26:40.308
Olivia Vincent's.
Director of the Devil Girls.

26:40.474 --> 26:44.195
Look around.
The entire Devils Nation is here.

26:45.312 --> 26:49.317
Just another day
in the extremely affordable life of me.

27:08.585 --> 27:11.304
Hey. You ready?

27:24.935 --> 27:28.189
I speak for all of the Devil Girls

27:28.355 --> 27:33.156
in expressing our deep sorrow
at Olivia's passing.

27:33.443 --> 27:37.118
Olivia Vincent was the Devil Girls.

27:37.823 --> 27:40.372
She had strength...

27:40.909 --> 27:42.582
...beauty...

27:43.620 --> 27:45.793
...class.

27:48.292 --> 27:52.593
She had big ideas
and an even bigger heart.

27:54.756 --> 27:58.260
I know any time
any of us needed advice,

27:58.385 --> 28:03.266
she was the first person we ran to.

28:15.194 --> 28:19.040
I learned a lot from Olivia
these past four years.

28:21.408 --> 28:23.877
I hope that when I'm her age...

28:24.036 --> 28:26.334
...I'm half the woman...

28:26.872 --> 28:29.375
...that sh... That she wa...

28:31.752 --> 28:35.507
If I could just say a few words.

28:39.301 --> 28:41.269
Grief takes many forms.

28:42.137 --> 28:45.107
All we can be sure of is
mourning the loss of a loved one

28:45.224 --> 28:49.320
is a very personal, profound journey.

28:49.937 --> 28:51.484
Matthew 5, verse 4.

28:51.647 --> 28:55.242
"Blessed are those that mourn,
for they shall be comforted."

28:55.734 --> 28:59.784
God comforts us, loves us...

29:00.197 --> 29:04.122
...so that we will share that love
when we need it most.

29:04.868 --> 29:07.747
From Him to us...

29:08.413 --> 29:09.790
...through us.

29:11.375 --> 29:13.377
I didn't know Olivia.

29:13.502 --> 29:17.006
But it's a testament to who she was
that you are all here.

29:17.214 --> 29:20.593
May we all mourn her passing,
each of us in our own way.

29:21.051 --> 29:23.270
And may we find comfort...

29:23.762 --> 29:25.105
...in each other.

29:26.265 --> 29:27.767
- Amen.
- Amen.

29:27.933 --> 29:29.480
Amen.

29:53.709 --> 29:57.430
<i>Oh-eh, oh, oh
Oh, let's play a game</i>

29:58.797 --> 30:02.347
<i>I am the predator
I'm gonna make you my prey</i>

30:05.637 --> 30:07.981
<i>I'm coming straight for your heart</i>

30:08.640 --> 30:13.146
<i>I know what I want and I don't play shy
So baby boy I'm gonna hunt you down</i>

30:13.645 --> 30:17.991
<i>Get wild get rough get loud, baby
Take me higher</i>

30:18.650 --> 30:22.029
<i>I'm an animal
I'm going in for the kill</i>

30:23.905 --> 30:27.785
<i>So don't stop, go hard, get hot
Let's start a fire</i>

30:28.660 --> 30:33.006
<i>I'm an animal
I'm going in for the kill</i>

30:44.468 --> 30:46.812
At least she's got a five-star view.

30:48.597 --> 30:49.940
Where have you been?

30:50.098 --> 30:52.396
- Getting closer to God.
- Let's go.

30:57.397 --> 30:58.944
Jelena.

31:00.067 --> 31:01.444
Could you sign this?

31:01.610 --> 31:04.659
He is out of his mind devastated,
poordean

31:05.906 --> 31:08.955
Steady, Teddy. This is a funeral.

31:09.117 --> 31:11.870
This is your life. I want it.

31:12.204 --> 31:13.547
Well, get in line.

31:13.705 --> 31:18.131
- Whoa, hey, I don't want any trouble.
- Me either. Off you go.

31:18.293 --> 31:21.672
Look, I'm sorry about before,
but we're both producers.

31:22.255 --> 31:24.758
- You get it.
- You're a producer?

31:24.925 --> 31:27.849
You gotta fight for a woman like Kyle.
I have that chick

31:28.011 --> 31:30.639
from those Hunger <i>Games</i> movies
begging to play her.

31:30.806 --> 31:32.934
Told her to clean up
her Southern accent.

31:33.100 --> 31:35.353
She sounds like
she got kicked in the mouth.

31:36.770 --> 31:39.614
- Ninety-thousand.
- Teddy's gonna give me a cheque...

31:39.773 --> 31:41.070
One-hundred thousand.

31:41.233 --> 31:43.486
With him,
you'll get a movie of the week.

31:43.652 --> 31:46.701
With me, you'll walk the red carpet
at the Academy Awards.

31:46.822 --> 31:50.201
- Hundred and twenty-five.
- OK, let's not push our luck.

31:52.994 --> 31:56.840
One hundred and fifty thousand?

31:56.998 --> 31:58.671
- Take it or leave it.
- Take it.

32:00.919 --> 32:03.638
- You're obviously the better man.
- She's worth it.

32:04.840 --> 32:08.640
- Thank you, Teddy.
- No, thank you.

32:08.802 --> 32:10.520
Best funeral ever.

32:11.054 --> 32:13.352
I can't wait
to hear more of your stories.

32:19.062 --> 32:21.736
That was nice. Only 200,000 to go.

32:21.898 --> 32:26.074
You son of a bitch. This was your plan
from the beginning, to jack up the price.

32:26.236 --> 32:30.082
- Still only like working alone?
- I thought you were protecting me

32:30.240 --> 32:32.993
- when you busted into my apartment.
- Come on, Kyle.

32:33.160 --> 32:36.004
I've heard a woman scream in pleasure
plenty of times.

32:37.080 --> 32:38.707
See you.

32:42.919 --> 32:46.844
- I can't believe she's gone.
- I know.

32:53.472 --> 32:55.395
She's lovely.

32:59.769 --> 33:02.522
I get to move on too, Sloane.

33:08.904 --> 33:10.747
It's good, he thinks we're dating.

33:14.117 --> 33:16.040
It is good.

33:18.955 --> 33:20.957
Hey. He)'-

33:21.541 --> 33:24.135
- What's that about?
- Fighting the good fight.

33:24.294 --> 33:27.764
We haven't had a chance to talk
since I helped bring Zero to L.A.

33:27.923 --> 33:31.348
Look, I'm not his agent,
I know I'm not yours either,

33:31.510 --> 33:34.935
but I wanna tell you, I'm still your guy,
if you need something.

33:35.305 --> 33:36.648
We'll see.

33:44.231 --> 33:48.702
I wanted to thank you
for being cool with me and Pete.

33:48.860 --> 33:50.828
I know it has to be strange.

33:50.946 --> 33:53.415
Not stranger than this.

33:54.741 --> 33:57.961
Just promise me I'll never have
to walk in on the two of you.

33:58.203 --> 33:59.876
Why would you say that?

34:00.038 --> 34:03.633
Apparently I learned how not to lock
doors from my mother and father.

34:03.792 --> 34:07.296
Catching them was one of the more
scarring moments of my life.

34:07.420 --> 34:09.263
When was this again?

34:10.047 --> 34:11.425
A couple weeks ago.

34:12.300 --> 34:13.973
Right.

34:21.601 --> 34:23.569
Raquel? Hey, Raquel.

34:23.728 --> 34:26.356
You had sex with her, Pete.
Two weeks ago.

34:26.523 --> 34:28.275
Wait, wait, wait. Let me explain.

34:28.440 --> 34:31.320
I'm not gonna be your backup piece.

34:52.924 --> 34:55.393
It's been a great first date.

34:55.552 --> 34:57.054
This wasn't a date.

34:57.220 --> 35:00.394
I picked you up in a fancy car,
took you somewhere black-tie.

35:00.557 --> 35:04.812
I was your knight in shining armour.
We had biblical sex.

35:05.270 --> 35:07.489
Sounds like a date to me.

35:31.755 --> 35:33.223
It's crazy.

35:33.381 --> 35:37.102
One minute someone can be here
and the next minute...

35:41.848 --> 35:45.978
Derek, can you just stand here?
With me?

36:52.919 --> 36:54.262
Over here.

37:19.571 --> 37:23.121
Chase Vincent, you're under arrest
for the murder of Olivia Vincent.

37:23.283 --> 37:25.081
- What are you doing?
- Hands, sir.

37:25.243 --> 37:27.996
Are you crazy? I did not kill my wife.

37:28.413 --> 37:29.710
I didn't kill my Wife.

37:29.873 --> 37:33.673
We found the shovel used to bury her
in the trunk of your car. Let's go.

37:33.835 --> 37:35.758
You have the right to remain silent.

37:35.920 --> 37:38.514
Anything you say
can and will be used against you.

37:38.673 --> 37:41.392
You have the right to an attorney...

37:41.551 --> 37:43.599
Oh, my God.

37:44.262 --> 37:46.435
I did not kill my wife.

37:54.105 --> 37:55.652
<i>Next time on Hit the Floor:</i>

37:55.815 --> 37:58.910
You came. I can't tell you
what this means to me.

37:59.068 --> 38:00.615
How could you do this?

38:00.779 --> 38:03.453
You want the Malibu house?
What is it you want?

38:04.449 --> 38:06.827
Doesn't seem like a worthy adversary
for you.

38:06.993 --> 38:10.497
She's gotten smarter. She's doing
something that'll get her fired.

38:10.622 --> 38:12.624
- Pavli.
- Never should've let this one

38:12.791 --> 38:16.591
out of your sight. Someone else
was bound to snatch him up.

38:16.753 --> 38:19.882
You weren't kidding. Terrence
and Derek are on shaky ground.

38:20.048 --> 38:21.516
See why I sold you on L.A.?

38:21.674 --> 38:25.850
There's a murderer inside Devils Arena.
It's time to get out.
