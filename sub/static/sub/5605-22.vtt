00:03.771 --> 00:04.837
Hey, Ed.

00:04.839 --> 00:05.938
Hmm.

00:05.940 --> 00:07.239
Got you something.

00:09.010 --> 00:10.509
That better not
be your finger

00:10.511 --> 00:13.145
poking through the bottom
of that box again.

00:13.147 --> 00:15.180
That scared the pudding
out of me.

00:15.182 --> 00:18.183
25 years ago today,
we got in business together.

00:18.185 --> 00:20.119
This is my way
of saying thank you

00:20.121 --> 00:22.521
for letting me
make you rich.

00:23.791 --> 00:25.491
Come on, Mikey.

00:25.493 --> 00:26.859
Aww, look at that.
(chuckles)

00:26.861 --> 00:28.293
Wow.

00:28.295 --> 00:29.962
Well, you've done pretty well,
too, Mike.

00:29.964 --> 00:31.563
Look how much you just blew
on a --

00:31.565 --> 00:33.632
on a dumb
anniversary present.

00:33.634 --> 00:36.301
I'll take that
as a "thank you."

00:36.303 --> 00:37.469
Congrats.

00:37.471 --> 00:39.505
All right, pal.
(stammers)

00:39.507 --> 00:40.706
I've got something
for you.

00:40.708 --> 00:41.807
Just hold one second
here.

00:41.809 --> 00:44.309
Ah, yes.
(clears throat)

00:44.311 --> 00:47.379
A, um,
gold pen and pencil set.

00:47.381 --> 00:49.114
Oh, I can't accept that.

00:50.184 --> 00:52.785
I gave that to you
on our 20th.

00:54.221 --> 00:56.588
And I've seen you clean your ear
with that pen.

00:56.590 --> 00:59.091
Yeah. I'm sorry.
I just --

00:59.093 --> 01:01.193
I just can't remember
these damn anniversaries.

01:01.195 --> 01:03.495
Eh, don't worry.
It's not like we're married.

01:03.497 --> 01:06.065
Maybe that's why
we lasted so long.

01:06.067 --> 01:08.033
Thank you, pal.
Congratulations.

01:08.035 --> 01:09.268
All right, good.
Look at that.

01:09.270 --> 01:11.003
-Hey, hon.
-Hey, Dad.

01:11.005 --> 01:12.204
I'm a schmuck.

01:12.206 --> 01:15.541
Do you want me to argue
or agree?

01:15.543 --> 01:17.509
You dad just
gave me a watch

01:17.511 --> 01:20.279
to celebrate our being partners
for 25 years,

01:20.281 --> 01:23.582
and I tried to give him a pen
that had been in my ear.

01:23.584 --> 01:26.018
Oh, well, you know, Dad's
not really into fancy gifts.

01:26.020 --> 01:28.353
Why don't you just take him
to dinner or something?

01:28.355 --> 01:30.289
Well -- Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

01:30.291 --> 01:32.624
How about a tribute dinner
at Outdoor Man Grill?

01:32.626 --> 01:35.060
We could have speeches
and slide shows.

01:35.062 --> 01:36.462
It would blow him away.

01:36.464 --> 01:39.131
Wow. That would be a pretty
thoughtful gift, Ed.

01:39.133 --> 01:42.801
A lot more thoughtful
than this watch, I think.

01:42.803 --> 01:45.304
Damn, he had it engraved.

01:45.306 --> 01:46.738
(clears throat)

01:46.740 --> 01:49.374
(voice breaking)
I love you, too, buddy.

01:50.578 --> 01:53.645
-- Captions by VITAC --

01:57.384 --> 01:59.218
Well, that was
a waste of time.

01:59.220 --> 02:00.886
I just clicked through
25 questions

02:00.888 --> 02:03.622
to find out I should be
living in Colorado.

02:04.725 --> 02:06.558
I took that same test.

02:06.560 --> 02:09.895
It said I should be living
in 1956.

02:09.897 --> 02:13.332
Oh, my God! Guys!
Look at what I just got!

02:13.334 --> 02:17.102
Front Range Fashions wants
to buy Mandy Baxter Designs!

02:17.104 --> 02:19.171
Mandy!
Honey, that's amazing!

02:19.173 --> 02:22.341
Wow, the little company that you
run out of our little basement

02:22.343 --> 02:25.444
is somehow on the
fashion industry radar.

02:25.446 --> 02:26.979
Wow, Mom.

02:26.981 --> 02:29.848
Way to compliment me --
two "littles" and a "somehow."

02:29.850 --> 02:31.517
It<i> is</i> a compliment.

02:31.519 --> 02:33.785
You started this little company
all by yourself,

02:33.787 --> 02:35.754
and look at you -- radar!

02:35.756 --> 02:36.955
-I'm really psyched.
-Yeah.

02:36.957 --> 02:38.924
And now, after Kyle and I
get married,

02:38.926 --> 02:41.093
we can finally afford
one of those downtown lofts

02:41.095 --> 02:43.829
like he's always dreamed
of<i> me</i> having.

02:43.831 --> 02:45.364
And, you know,
then we'll have money

02:45.366 --> 02:46.999
left over
to grow the company.

02:47.001 --> 02:48.500
Yeah, one tiny thing --

02:48.502 --> 02:51.103
you make all that money
by selling your company.

02:51.105 --> 02:52.604
That's like
selling your kid

02:52.606 --> 02:54.706
so you can afford to send him
to college.

02:54.708 --> 02:56.208
No.

02:56.210 --> 02:57.609
I'd just be
selling the name,

02:57.611 --> 02:59.845
like Lincoln did
with that memorial.

02:59.847 --> 03:02.714
He ended slavery.
You make crop tops.

03:02.716 --> 03:03.849
Good comparison.

03:03.851 --> 03:07.052
There's also
a noncompete clause.

03:07.054 --> 03:09.888
Means you can't sell
or make clothes for two years.

03:09.890 --> 03:11.156
Oh. Yeah, sweetie,
you'd essentially

03:11.158 --> 03:12.558
be out of
the fashion business.

03:12.560 --> 03:14.860
Right. If you want my advice,
which you do,

03:14.862 --> 03:17.029
I say tell them to drop this
and just work hard

03:17.031 --> 03:18.630
and make your own company.

03:18.632 --> 03:21.066
Okay, so you're saying I should
pick years of hard work

03:21.068 --> 03:23.335
over lots of money now?

03:23.337 --> 03:26.471
It's like you don't
even know me.

03:26.473 --> 03:29.975
I know you,
and I know your generation.

03:29.977 --> 03:32.077
It's all about
instant gratification.

03:32.079 --> 03:35.080
You know, I blame the Internet
and that yogurt in a tube.

03:35.082 --> 03:36.682
Yeah.

03:36.684 --> 03:40.552
Get a spoon, sit down,
and do the work!

03:41.889 --> 03:44.223
Your father always says,
"Business isn't a sprint.

03:44.225 --> 03:45.691
It's a marathon."

03:45.693 --> 03:47.392
Um, actually,
Sprint<i> is</i> a business.

03:47.394 --> 03:48.927
Why am I taking advice
from you?

03:48.929 --> 03:50.596
(laughs)

03:50.598 --> 03:53.832
Honey, the bottom line is
there are no shortcuts.

03:53.834 --> 03:55.200
All right.
I appreciate it

03:55.202 --> 03:56.668
when you give me
one of your talks, Dad,

03:56.670 --> 03:58.837
but, uh, money also talks.

03:58.839 --> 04:01.173
And what makes this decision
so hard is that...

04:01.175 --> 04:03.675
I really love you both.

04:03.677 --> 04:05.777
Actually,
she did get you on one point.

04:06.680 --> 04:08.347
Sprint<i> is</i> a business.

04:08.349 --> 04:09.815
(scoffs)

04:20.060 --> 04:22.127
Did you have to touch
every one of them?

04:22.129 --> 04:24.563
I touched one...

04:24.565 --> 04:26.932
to move it out of the way
to get to the one I wanted.

04:28.602 --> 04:32.771
Legally, the first one you touch
should be the one you eat.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.673
Okay.

04:41.882 --> 04:43.382
Could I see you guys
a moment, please?

04:43.384 --> 04:45.217
Oh, great. Great.
Now we're both in trouble.

04:45.219 --> 04:46.184
Thanks a lot.

04:49.990 --> 04:51.890
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

04:51.892 --> 04:53.625
All right.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.394
I'm planning a surprise dinner
for Mike

04:55.396 --> 04:57.496
to honor his service
to the store.

04:57.498 --> 04:59.398
You know, I don't think you know
how surprise works.

04:59.400 --> 05:02.167
You're not supposed
to tell people.

05:02.169 --> 05:03.402
I-I'll be giving a speech.

05:03.404 --> 05:04.770
I want you guys
to give one, too.

05:04.772 --> 05:06.772
Why us?

05:06.774 --> 05:08.173
Because you're
his best friends.

05:08.175 --> 05:09.941
(both laugh)

05:09.943 --> 05:12.244
Yeah.

05:14.181 --> 05:16.581
I don't want to be the only one
giving a speech, all right?

05:16.583 --> 05:18.350
So, please, come up
with something,

05:18.352 --> 05:19.518
run it by me tomorrow.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.253
Come on.
Okay, thank you.

05:21.255 --> 05:22.521
Thank you, guys.
Thank you.

05:22.523 --> 05:24.656
Okay.
Good, good, good.

05:24.658 --> 05:26.925
And from now on,
you don't touch a doughnut

05:26.927 --> 05:28.527
unless you're
gonna eat it.

05:34.001 --> 05:36.668
Dad!
You're a genius.

05:36.670 --> 05:40.038
Now,<i> that</i> is how you
enter a room.

05:40.040 --> 05:42.774
Yeah, especially if your dad
is Albert Einstein.

05:42.776 --> 05:44.276
If your dad
was Ronald Reagan,

05:44.278 --> 05:46.712
you'd say, "Dad,
you're an airport."

05:46.714 --> 05:48.313
MANDY: That's good.

05:48.315 --> 05:49.948
Listen.

05:49.950 --> 05:51.983
I've thought about
Front Range Fashions' offer,

05:51.985 --> 05:53.618
and I'm<i> not</i>
going to take the buyout.

05:53.620 --> 05:55.821
Oh. I am going to build
the company myself.

05:55.823 --> 05:56.722
Good idea.
Yeah.

05:56.724 --> 05:58.023
Using<i> my</i> idea.

05:58.025 --> 06:00.992
You're being smart, Mandy.
Yeah.

06:00.994 --> 06:02.694
Slow and steady
wins the race.

06:02.696 --> 06:03.962
And that's exactly
how I want to do it.

06:03.964 --> 06:05.297
Except, instead of
slow and steady,

06:05.299 --> 06:06.631
I'm gonna do it,
like, super fast.

06:06.633 --> 06:08.467
Why don't you run upstairs

06:08.469 --> 06:10.068
and get that book,
"Tortoise and The Hare"?

06:10.070 --> 06:11.303
Maybe this time
she'll understand it.

06:11.305 --> 06:12.571
(chuckles)

06:12.573 --> 06:14.740
Uh, sweetie, what exactly
is your plan?

06:14.742 --> 06:16.842
Uh, we're actually still
working out the details.

06:16.844 --> 06:18.076
No, no, we're not.

06:18.078 --> 06:20.545
See, um, Kyle and I
have to face facts.

06:20.547 --> 06:22.848
Without the buyout,
we can't afford to get

06:22.850 --> 06:26.184
the bitchin' loft downtown
<i> and</i> put money into my company.

06:26.186 --> 06:28.754
MIKE: Yeah. Well, and
you're not gonna like this.

06:28.756 --> 06:31.189
Maybe you should wait
on the bitchin' loft.

06:31.191 --> 06:32.657
Yeah, exactly.

06:32.659 --> 06:36.228
Which is why
we're gonna move in with you!

06:43.837 --> 06:45.604
I know this might be
too late to say,

06:45.606 --> 06:48.240
but I'm not sure
we should have children.

06:48.242 --> 06:49.841
Dad, look.

06:49.843 --> 06:52.544
If Mandy Baxter Designs is
gonna grow like your company,

06:52.546 --> 06:55.080
this is the step
that Kyle and I need to take.

06:55.082 --> 06:57.616
Yeah? Kyle, what do you think
about this step?

06:57.618 --> 06:59.084
Well, I think --

06:59.086 --> 07:00.886
He<i> loves</i> the idea,
don't you, Kyle?

07:00.888 --> 07:02.954
Yeah, of course.

07:02.956 --> 07:05.557
You know, I-I've basically lived
on my own since I was 16,

07:05.559 --> 07:08.260
so it'll be fun living under
someone else's roof,

07:08.262 --> 07:11.129
by...someone else's
rules...

07:11.131 --> 07:13.031
like I'm in a cage.

07:13.967 --> 07:15.734
You see?

07:15.736 --> 07:17.302
I-I think,
for everyone's sake,

07:17.304 --> 07:19.104
I should probably start
wearing pants at night.

07:20.441 --> 07:23.375
Listen.
Give us a minute.

07:25.913 --> 07:27.979
Please tell me you think
this is a bad idea.

07:27.981 --> 07:29.648
It's a horrible idea.

07:29.650 --> 07:32.050
But once Mandy gets an idea
in her head, it sticks,

07:32.052 --> 07:34.719
like that marble she got stuck
up her nose in preschool.

07:36.423 --> 07:38.390
And again
in fourth grade.

07:38.392 --> 07:41.059
Yeah, well, that's when
we switched pediatricians.

07:41.061 --> 07:43.228
It just got embarrassing.

07:43.230 --> 07:45.263
Mandy's got to discover
on her own

07:45.265 --> 07:47.499
that this shortcut
is a terrible idea.

07:47.501 --> 07:49.167
Okay, all right.
How?

07:49.169 --> 07:52.504
Kyle is clearly
not into this, right?

07:52.506 --> 07:54.105
I say we let him move in.
He's gonna hate it.

07:54.107 --> 07:56.341
Nobody wants to go
from living alone

07:56.343 --> 07:58.510
to having to wear pants
at night.

07:58.512 --> 08:01.947
(laughs)
That's insane!

08:01.949 --> 08:03.782
You know, we might be
pushing our luck,

08:03.784 --> 08:06.551
but do they really need
the master bedroom?

08:08.288 --> 08:09.955
I-I just don't think
your parents

08:09.957 --> 08:11.756
are gonna like me
living here, Mandy.

08:11.758 --> 08:13.825
I'm a sleep-whistler.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.494
-Listen up.
-Okay.

08:15.496 --> 08:17.128
-We've talked about it...
-Yeah.

08:17.130 --> 08:20.031
...and I-I think before we think
about you guys moving in,

08:20.033 --> 08:21.433
there should be
a trial period.

08:21.435 --> 08:23.835
Yeah. Uh, Kyle can live here
for a week,

08:23.837 --> 08:25.504
and --
and we'll give it a try.

08:25.506 --> 08:27.839
Yay! And you know what just
occurred to me --

08:27.841 --> 08:29.674
what if we got
your bedroom?

08:29.676 --> 08:32.544
You will stay
in your room,

08:32.546 --> 08:34.613
and Kyle can have
the guest room.

08:35.516 --> 08:37.883
Yaay.

08:37.885 --> 08:40.785
Get some rest.
Calisthenics are at 5:00 a.m.

08:40.787 --> 08:43.221
With pants!

08:43.223 --> 08:45.857
Welcome to the cage!

08:53.500 --> 08:56.835
(clattering)
KYLE: Ah, dang it! Okay.

08:56.837 --> 08:59.237
Wow. Kyle's only been here
one night,

08:59.239 --> 09:01.373
and he already sounds like
he's having a tough time.

09:01.375 --> 09:02.707
Stop. Remember.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.342
When we get in there,
it's all about rules.

09:04.344 --> 09:05.911
Okay. No big smiles from you, Ms.
Sunshine.

09:05.913 --> 09:07.245
Leave the teeth
at the door.

09:08.815 --> 09:11.483
Listen, Kyle.
We have rules around here --

09:11.485 --> 09:13.919
Is that bacon?

09:13.921 --> 09:15.687
Yeah.

09:15.689 --> 09:17.689
And he cooked the eggs
in bacon,

09:17.691 --> 09:19.491
used bacon to butter
the toast.

09:19.493 --> 09:21.092
I may be going out
on a limb here,

09:21.094 --> 09:23.662
but I'm pretty sure
the boy's a genius.

09:23.664 --> 09:27.032
And a bacon genius.
That's the best kind.

09:27.034 --> 09:30.402
And, Mrs. B.,
I made you a veggie omelet.

09:30.404 --> 09:32.037
Oh.

09:32.039 --> 09:34.439
Certainly sounds healthy.

09:34.441 --> 09:35.840
He put bacon in it.

09:35.842 --> 09:38.176
(gasps) Yay!

09:38.178 --> 09:40.078
And I hope I didn't break
any rules,

09:40.080 --> 09:42.681
but I also organized the
refrigerator and the pantry.

09:42.683 --> 09:45.817
Oh,<i> and</i> my thoughts on violence
in media.

09:47.688 --> 09:49.354
It's bad.

09:49.356 --> 09:52.891
Hey, babe.
What are you doing?

09:52.893 --> 09:54.426
Oh, I made breakfast
for the family.

09:54.428 --> 09:56.394
Oh, and, Mr. B., I made<i> us</i>
breakfast to go.

09:56.396 --> 09:58.563
Wow.
Look at that.

09:58.565 --> 10:01.399
Having Kyle here certainly seems
to be a good idea.

10:01.401 --> 10:03.635
Hey, I'll have waffles.
-No, no.

10:03.637 --> 10:05.437
Waffles and I
are late for work.

10:05.439 --> 10:07.072
That's my new nickname
for Kyle.

10:07.074 --> 10:08.139
(chuckles)

10:08.141 --> 10:10.275
Come on, Waffles.

10:10.277 --> 10:13.211
I love that.
All right, bye, Mandy.

10:13.213 --> 10:14.512
Give me --

10:18.919 --> 10:21.319
Bring it, boys.
Dazzle me with your words.

10:21.321 --> 10:22.387
Come on.

10:22.389 --> 10:23.888
Good evening, folks.

10:23.890 --> 10:25.757
We're here to honor
Mike Baxter

10:25.759 --> 10:28.560
and talk about all the things
that make him such a great guy.

10:28.562 --> 10:30.595
-All right.
-So, good night, everybody!

10:30.597 --> 10:32.430
(both laugh)

10:32.432 --> 10:34.165
Okay. Okay.

10:34.167 --> 10:38.403
A friend, a co-worker,
an expert fisherman --

10:38.405 --> 10:41.606
these are just some of the
people Mike Baxter has fired.

10:41.608 --> 10:42.841
(both laugh)

10:44.277 --> 10:46.578
Hang on. I got one.
This is good.

10:46.580 --> 10:50.615
It's fair to say that a<i> majority</i>
of people like Mike Baxter.

10:50.617 --> 10:53.985
Because God knows
the minorities don't!

10:53.987 --> 10:56.421
(both laugh)

10:56.423 --> 11:00.291
What is this?
You think this is funny?

11:00.293 --> 11:02.160
I do. And you know something?
I know funny.

11:02.162 --> 11:04.829
For your information,
I did two open mike nights

11:04.831 --> 11:07.932
at the Comedy Kiosk
down at the mall.

11:07.934 --> 11:09.634
Listen.

11:09.636 --> 11:11.136
We're paying tribute to a man

11:11.138 --> 11:13.304
who has dedicated his life
to the store.

11:13.306 --> 11:14.506
And you mock him.

11:14.508 --> 11:17.676
We were also working
on a limerick.

11:17.678 --> 11:18.877
Give me those.
Come on.

11:18.879 --> 11:20.712
Give me that.
You're gonna start over.

11:20.714 --> 11:22.480
Write something respectful,
please.

11:22.482 --> 11:25.116
Here's a trick I learned
at Toastmasters, all right?

11:25.118 --> 11:27.018
You -- You pick
an admirable trait,

11:27.020 --> 11:29.788
and you write how
the dictionary defines it.

11:29.790 --> 11:31.990
Bravery, honesty,
integrity.

11:31.992 --> 11:34.259
Now I know how the dictionary
defines "boring."

11:35.829 --> 11:38.029
Are you sure you don't want
to hear the limerick?

11:38.031 --> 11:39.064
Ugh.

11:39.066 --> 11:40.498
I want something heartfelt,

11:40.500 --> 11:42.634
something that'll make
Mike feel special.

11:44.337 --> 11:46.237
"There was an Outdoor Man
named Mike..."

11:46.239 --> 11:47.906
Out, out, out, out,
out, out, out!

11:47.908 --> 11:50.008
Get out! Go on.
Out the door!

11:50.010 --> 11:51.710
Come on.
-It was good.

11:51.712 --> 11:54.679
♪♪

11:54.681 --> 11:58.416
So, the cloud says, "You can't
get a balloon to do that."

11:58.418 --> 12:00.251
(laughs)

12:00.253 --> 12:02.087
-Oh, boy.
-Oh. Look.

12:02.089 --> 12:04.089
It's the world's weirdest
bromance.

12:04.091 --> 12:06.991
Ah, commuting with your dad
all this week has been great.

12:06.993 --> 12:09.928
I listen, I laugh,
and I learn.

12:09.930 --> 12:12.497
I talk, I joke,
and I teach.

12:12.499 --> 12:16.534
I do that when I'm by myself,
but this is more fun.

12:16.536 --> 12:17.836
(sighs)

12:17.838 --> 12:19.170
Hey.

12:19.172 --> 12:21.740
Well, I'm gonna go see
what your dad's doing.

12:21.742 --> 12:22.907
No! Hey! Kyle!

12:22.909 --> 12:24.209
No, no, no, no, no.

12:24.211 --> 12:25.877
He just left the room.

12:25.879 --> 12:28.079
Come on. Um...

12:28.081 --> 12:30.415
I was hoping tonight,
you know,

12:30.417 --> 12:32.617
we could spend a little
quality time together.

12:32.619 --> 12:34.552
Oh.
Abso-tively.

12:34.554 --> 12:36.087
I'm gonna watch a movie
with your parents.

12:36.089 --> 12:37.088
You should join us.

12:37.090 --> 12:39.124
No.

12:39.126 --> 12:41.226
I meant something
just with the two of us.

12:41.228 --> 12:43.561
Oh. Uh, but I've already
promised your dad

12:43.563 --> 12:45.697
that I was gonna make homemade
ice cream again.

12:45.699 --> 12:48.733
He wants something with caramel,
pecans, vanilla, and bacon.

12:48.735 --> 12:51.302
It's gonna taste
like bacon.

12:51.304 --> 12:55.540
Kyle, you guys have watched
a movie every night this week.

12:55.542 --> 12:58.209
Well, Tuesday was
Baxter home movies.

12:58.211 --> 12:59.778
I didn't feel left out,

12:59.780 --> 13:02.380
even though I wasn't
in any of them.

13:02.382 --> 13:06.117
And you, young lady,
you were a handful.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.485
No!

13:07.487 --> 13:09.454
Don't try to distract me
with how cute I was.

13:09.456 --> 13:11.289
You're spending all your time
with my parents.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.591
Is this what it's gonna be like
for the rest of our lives?

13:13.593 --> 13:14.826
I don't know.

13:14.828 --> 13:16.694
What have you heard?
Do they like me?

13:19.599 --> 13:21.132
-Honey?
-Yeah?

13:22.936 --> 13:24.002
What's the matter?

13:24.004 --> 13:25.970
Well, I'm kind of sad.

13:25.972 --> 13:27.405
About what?

13:27.407 --> 13:30.141
Kyle goes back
to his apartment tomorrow.

13:30.143 --> 13:31.643
And -- And, I mean,
don't make fun of me,

13:31.645 --> 13:33.945
but...
I'm gonna miss him.

13:33.947 --> 13:35.413
I know what you mean.
I know.

13:35.415 --> 13:38.917
Now we got to go back
to stupid regular butter.

13:38.919 --> 13:41.519
All right, guys?

13:41.521 --> 13:45.023
Kyle is gonna love
the movie I got.

13:45.025 --> 13:46.858
"Babe."

13:46.860 --> 13:50.428
What are you thinking?!
He'll never make bacon again!

13:50.430 --> 13:51.663
Oh.

13:51.665 --> 13:52.997
Okay, well,
how about this?

13:52.999 --> 13:54.465
Maybe tomorrow night,

13:54.467 --> 13:57.035
instead of watching a movie,
we play charades?

13:57.037 --> 13:58.636
Dibs on Kyle!

13:58.638 --> 14:00.872
-Sweetie.
-What?

14:00.874 --> 14:02.540
He goes home tomorrow.

14:02.542 --> 14:06.678
So, Kyle leaves
and Mandy stays?

14:06.680 --> 14:09.814
Where's your God now,
Moses?!

14:09.816 --> 14:12.217
You know, it's weird.

14:12.219 --> 14:14.953
You thought Kyle wouldn't like
living here, but he does.

14:14.955 --> 14:16.454
And you know
what's even weirder,

14:16.456 --> 14:17.789
is --
is we love having him.

14:17.791 --> 14:19.657
Guess what
I called him today.

14:19.659 --> 14:22.961
Um...Waffles?

14:22.963 --> 14:25.463
Kyle.

14:25.465 --> 14:27.565
Not [Groaning] "Kyle!"

14:27.567 --> 14:30.501
Or [Grunting] "Kyle!"

14:30.503 --> 14:33.404
Just Kyle.

14:33.406 --> 14:35.473
Mm.
You know what?

14:35.475 --> 14:37.075
I really want them
to live here.

14:37.077 --> 14:38.142
Yeah.
Yeah.

14:38.144 --> 14:40.078
Hey.
You called me, Mr. B.?

14:40.080 --> 14:42.814
Uh, no. We were just talking
about you two moving in.

14:42.816 --> 14:45.550
Fingers crossed, applesauce,
let my dreams come true.

14:46.720 --> 14:48.987
And we'd be thrilled
if you did.

14:48.989 --> 14:49.921
Yes!

14:49.923 --> 14:50.822
No.
What?

14:50.824 --> 14:52.423
I hate this idea.

14:52.425 --> 14:55.059
There's no way we're living here
after we get married.

14:55.061 --> 14:58.796
Well, now we know applesauce
has no power.

15:07.607 --> 15:09.440
Listen. Took a vote.

15:09.442 --> 15:11.276
Kyle stays,
you're gonna leave.

15:13.446 --> 15:15.413
That's<i> so</i> funny, Dad.

15:15.415 --> 15:16.915
I've waited all my life
to get a son,

15:16.917 --> 15:18.449
and you make him leave
after one week?

15:18.451 --> 15:21.219
He's still got that
new-son smell.

15:21.221 --> 15:23.721
I'm supposed to be the center
of Kyle's universe,

15:23.723 --> 15:24.956
not you guys.

15:24.958 --> 15:27.225
A universe can only have
one center.

15:27.227 --> 15:28.559
That's science.

15:28.561 --> 15:30.428
Is that what
this is all about?

15:30.430 --> 15:32.730
You're jealous
of your mom and me?

15:32.732 --> 15:34.032
Look, we were supposed
to move in here

15:34.034 --> 15:35.733
and make it our love nest,

15:35.735 --> 15:37.268
and you guys were just supposed
to pay for everything.

15:37.270 --> 15:40.571
Yeah, why didn't we do that?
What's the matter with us?

15:40.573 --> 15:43.141
But instead,
you stole my fiancé.

15:43.143 --> 15:45.109
You know what? It was probably
your plan all along.

15:45.111 --> 15:47.211
Actually, I thought you'd be
miserable and you'd move out.

15:47.213 --> 15:48.713
<i> That</i> was the plan.

15:48.715 --> 15:51.783
Who knew the kid could make
homemade ice cream?

15:51.785 --> 15:55.553
When you think about it,
I'm the victim here.

15:55.555 --> 15:57.121
Okay, all that stuff Kyle
is doing

15:57.123 --> 15:58.589
is just him kissing up
to you.

15:58.591 --> 16:00.425
No, no, no.
I get that all the time at work.

16:00.427 --> 16:02.627
This -- This is
something different.

16:02.629 --> 16:05.930
He was so worried
about this whole idea.

16:05.932 --> 16:08.232
I mean, there's definitely
something going on with him.

16:08.234 --> 16:09.901
I just don't know
what it is yet.

16:09.903 --> 16:12.270
Yeah, well, I'm sure you'll get
to the bottom of it [sighs]

16:12.272 --> 16:14.372
sitting down here in
the basement all by yourself.

16:21.281 --> 16:23.614
Hey, hon.
What are you doing?

16:23.616 --> 16:26.784
Making you happy
by making you waffles.

16:26.786 --> 16:29.253
Waffles making waffles.

16:30.957 --> 16:33.791
Kyle, you don't always have
to make everyone else happy.

16:33.793 --> 16:35.526
You know,
like with my parents,

16:35.528 --> 16:37.962
they like a kid who challenges
them a bit more.

16:37.964 --> 16:40.865
VANESSA: No!
We -- We really don't!

16:42.936 --> 16:44.635
Yeah, uh, sorry.

16:44.637 --> 16:47.005
I, uh -- I got caught
in the garage

16:47.007 --> 16:50.274
and -- and didn't know
what to do, so, um...

16:50.276 --> 16:53.945
uh, carry on.

16:53.947 --> 16:56.647
I wasn't trying to make
your parents happy.

16:56.649 --> 16:58.783
I was doing all that
for me.

16:58.785 --> 17:00.218
Then I don't get it.
(scoffs)

17:00.220 --> 17:01.519
Mandy, I was nervous

17:01.521 --> 17:03.821
when you first suggested
all of this

17:03.823 --> 17:07.025
because I've never really lived
with a family before.

17:07.027 --> 17:09.127
Not a normal one, anyway.

17:09.129 --> 17:12.130
That's so sad.

17:12.132 --> 17:15.700
You think these people
are normal.

17:15.702 --> 17:18.836
My mom was just hiding
in the garage.

17:18.838 --> 17:21.305
Yeah, because she didn't want
to interrupt.

17:21.307 --> 17:23.574
She cares about
other people's feelings.

17:23.576 --> 17:26.044
Everyone around here does.
It's crazy.

17:26.046 --> 17:28.212
Yeah.

17:28.214 --> 17:30.214
And I'm really sorry
you'd never had that, you know?

17:30.216 --> 17:32.383
It must have been hard growing
up with your mean brothers

17:32.385 --> 17:37.822
and grandma who was only holding
onto reality with...yarn.

17:37.824 --> 17:40.491
I guess I just
got carried away

17:40.493 --> 17:42.593
'cause I finally get
what people mean

17:42.595 --> 17:44.862
when they talk
about "home."

17:44.864 --> 17:46.330
It's weird.

17:46.332 --> 17:47.832
You'd think something
so important

17:47.834 --> 17:49.700
would have a bigger word.

17:49.702 --> 17:52.703
Well, damn.

17:52.705 --> 17:55.173
I can't make you leave
after that.

17:56.676 --> 17:59.877
It doesn't matter
where we live, Mandy.

17:59.879 --> 18:01.546
Now I know what I want.

18:01.548 --> 18:03.614
I want a home.

18:03.616 --> 18:05.116
With you.

18:08.388 --> 18:11.689
This is all I need
to be happy --

18:11.691 --> 18:14.258
your complete
and total attention.

18:15.862 --> 18:18.563
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hope you're not keeping
the kid away from doing his cooking.

18:18.565 --> 18:20.031
No, Dad.

18:20.033 --> 18:23.234
He's making waffles
for the whole family.

18:23.236 --> 18:25.136
With homemade ice cream
on top.

18:27.874 --> 18:30.208
Can we keep him? Please?
I'll walk him. I will.

18:30.210 --> 18:31.876
I'll walk him all the time.
I really will.

18:35.648 --> 18:37.949
Hey, Mike Baxter here
for Outdoor Man.

18:37.951 --> 18:41.085
How come when someone says,
"I've got family in town,"

18:41.087 --> 18:43.321
our reaction is,
"You poor bastard"?

18:44.991 --> 18:47.492
Why can't we be more like
the African lions?

18:47.494 --> 18:49.127
They love sticking together --

18:49.129 --> 18:51.462
stalking, mauling, killing.

18:51.464 --> 18:54.398
Fun for the whole family.

18:54.400 --> 18:58.803
Lions love their family so much,
they even call it a pride,

18:58.805 --> 19:02.740
as opposed to most humans
who call it an embarrassment.

19:02.742 --> 19:04.308
Kind of sad everyone assumes

19:04.310 --> 19:07.612
our least favorite people
are the ones with our DNA.

19:07.614 --> 19:10.481
Which might be true
if you're Martin Sheen.

19:12.752 --> 19:16.254
But me, I'm actually happiest
when I'm with my whole family.

19:16.256 --> 19:17.855
George Bernard Shaw said,

19:17.857 --> 19:21.592
"A happy family is but
an earlier heaven."

19:21.594 --> 19:23.461
I don't know how he knew that.

19:23.463 --> 19:26.531
He was a kooky socialist
who never had any kids.

19:27.934 --> 19:29.467
But he was right.

19:29.469 --> 19:31.035
You want to appreciate
your family,

19:31.037 --> 19:32.937
talk to somebody
who doesn't have a family.

19:32.939 --> 19:35.606
That thing you take for granted,
some people pray for.

19:35.608 --> 19:37.108
And if you want to
make their day,

19:37.110 --> 19:38.876
take someone without a family

19:38.878 --> 19:40.711
and welcome them
into your family.

19:40.713 --> 19:42.346
It will help you realize
how lucky you are.

19:42.348 --> 19:43.981
Just make sure they really want
to be there,

19:43.983 --> 19:45.716
because otherwise,
it's kidnapping.

19:53.459 --> 19:57.328
The man has truly dedicated
his life to his family,

19:57.330 --> 19:59.497
both at home...

19:59.499 --> 20:00.865
and this store.

20:02.502 --> 20:04.335
In summary,

20:04.337 --> 20:06.804
Mike Baxter
is a model of integrity.

20:08.641 --> 20:10.508
That's right, Chuck.

20:10.510 --> 20:13.010
And Webster's Dictionary
defines integrity

20:13.012 --> 20:16.747
as a firm adherence to a code
of moral values.

20:16.749 --> 20:20.418
A better definition --
Mike Baxter.

20:22.922 --> 20:24.555
I didn't realize you and Joe
were so close.

20:24.557 --> 20:26.157
We're not.

20:26.159 --> 20:29.260
Thank you, gentlemen.
Thank you. (clears throat)

20:29.262 --> 20:32.430
Now I know how the dictionary
defines "boring."

20:34.033 --> 20:37.168
Ladies and gentlemen, we're here
tonight to honor Mike Baxter,

20:37.170 --> 20:41.072
to talk about all the things
that make him such a great guy.

20:41.074 --> 20:42.807
Good night, everybody!

20:46.346 --> 20:48.779
It's fair to say that
the majority of people

20:48.781 --> 20:50.848
like Mike Baxter because...

20:50.850 --> 20:52.950
God knows minorities don't,
right, Chuck, huh?

20:54.721 --> 20:57.455
He stole your jokes,
didn't he?

20:57.457 --> 21:00.625
Hey, if he does the limerick,
we're out of here.

21:00.627 --> 21:03.461
A friend, an expert fisherman,

21:03.463 --> 21:07.064
and a (clears throat)

21:07.066 --> 21:09.700
(voice breaking)
a giver of watches.

21:09.702 --> 21:11.802
I love you, buddy.
