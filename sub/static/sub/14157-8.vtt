00:11.645 --> 00:12.813
>> I JUST GOT WORD ABOUT A RAID

00:12.813 --> 00:13.747
ON THE EDEN GEMS.

00:13.747 --> 00:15.149
THE D.A. IS INVESTIGATING YOU

00:15.149 --> 00:16.184
FOR PARTICIPATING IN A STOLEN

00:16.184 --> 00:17.418
GEM RING.

00:17.418 --> 00:18.319
>> I REALLY LOVE A WOMAN THAT

00:18.319 --> 00:19.320
KNOWS HER WAY AROUND THE ROPES.

00:19.320 --> 00:20.188

00:27.728 --> 00:29.263
>> OH, WELL, I THINK YOU'RE A

00:29.263 --> 00:30.131
VISION.

00:30.131 --> 00:31.765
>> AWW, THANK YOU.

00:31.765 --> 00:33.501
>> APRIL WAS THE CLOSER.

00:33.501 --> 00:35.669
SERGIO REQUIRED A MORE DELICATE

00:35.669 --> 00:36.670
TOUCH.

00:36.670 --> 00:37.771
>> I DON'T WANT YOU DOING ANY

00:37.771 --> 00:39.273
BUSINESS WITH MY LITTLE BROTHER.

00:39.273 --> 00:40.674
SO THERE'S NOT GONNA BE ANY

00:40.674 --> 00:42.343
BUSINESS WITH MY BROTHER.

00:42.343 --> 00:43.811
>> LOOK, NO OFFENSE, DEACON, BUT

00:43.811 --> 00:45.479
CUT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU.

00:45.479 --> 00:46.480
>> NOT YET.

00:46.480 --> 00:48.216
>> MALCOLM, WE BOTH KNOW WHO

00:48.216 --> 00:49.217
DEACON REALLY IS.

00:49.217 --> 00:50.451
THEY DIDN'T CALL HIM "ROCK AND

00:50.451 --> 00:51.685
GLOCK" BACK IN THE DAY ON THE

00:51.685 --> 00:52.686
VIDEO SETS FOR NOTHING.

00:52.686 --> 00:54.488
>> [sighs] I'M SO TIRED OF

00:54.488 --> 00:55.456
GAMES, KEISHA.

00:55.456 --> 00:56.357
>> MM-HMM, WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT

00:56.357 --> 00:57.225
THEY SAY.

00:57.225 --> 00:58.259
IF YOU DON'T PLAY, YOU CAN'T

00:58.259 --> 01:01.295
WIN.

01:01.295 --> 01:02.863
>> * SINGLE

* I CAN FOLLOW, I CAN LEAD

01:13.807 --> 01:18.812
>> * I WON'T LOSE CONTROL *

01:18.812 --> 01:21.315
>> * YOU CAN'T GET MY LOVE *

01:21.315 --> 01:23.317
* I KNOW YOU WANT IT

01:23.317 --> 01:24.252

01:37.631 --> 01:38.566
WELL, THANKS FOR THE AFTERNOON,

01:38.566 --> 01:39.433
LADIES.

01:39.433 --> 01:40.368
I GOTTA GO, I GOTTA PREPARE FOR

01:40.368 --> 01:41.669
MY MEETING WITH SERGIO.

01:41.669 --> 01:43.937
>> MM.

01:43.937 --> 01:46.474
[giggles] DOING WHAT?

01:46.474 --> 01:47.441
>> READING EVERYTHING THAT HAS

01:47.441 --> 01:48.342
EVER BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT HIM ON

01:48.342 --> 01:49.009
THE INTERNET.

01:49.009 --> 01:50.744
>> SOUNDS LIKE CYBER STALKING.

01:50.744 --> 01:52.012
>> [laughs]

01:52.012 --> 01:53.247
THAT IS ONLY IF IT'S A

01:53.247 --> 01:54.315
PROSPECTIVE BOYFRIEND.

01:54.315 --> 01:56.417
IF IT IS A CLIENT, IT IS OKAY.

01:56.417 --> 01:58.018
ALL I KNOW IS DAVID AND I HAVE

01:58.018 --> 01:59.353
TO LAND SERGIO.

01:59.353 --> 02:00.654
>> OOH, WHAT'S GOING ON WITH

02:00.654 --> 02:01.522
DAVID?

02:01.522 --> 02:02.390
>> I DON'T KNOW.

02:02.390 --> 02:03.857
IT'S LIKE ONE SECOND I CAN SEE

02:03.857 --> 02:05.092
MYSELF DATING HIM, AND THEN THE

02:05.092 --> 02:06.059
NEXT SECOND IT'S LIKE I JUST

02:06.059 --> 02:07.027
WANT TO KILL HIM.

02:07.027 --> 02:07.961
>> OOH, BE CAREFUL.

02:07.961 --> 02:08.862
I FELT THAT WAY WHEN I MET

02:08.862 --> 02:09.863
MALCOLM.

02:09.863 --> 02:11.031
AND I STILL FEEL THAT WAY

02:11.031 --> 02:11.899
SOMETIMES.

02:11.899 --> 02:12.766
>> [laughs]

02:12.766 --> 02:13.734
>> IT'S EASY LIVING WITH A MAN

02:13.734 --> 02:15.403
IN FIVE-STAR HOTELS, BUT IT'S

02:15.403 --> 02:16.504
QUITE A DIFFERENT STORY WHEN

02:16.504 --> 02:17.471
YOU'RE THE ONE PICKING UP HIS

02:17.471 --> 02:18.872
DIRTY SOCKS OFF THE FLOOR.

02:18.872 --> 02:21.409
>> OH. [laughs]

02:21.409 --> 02:22.576
>> NO, NO, IT'S NOT FUNNY.

02:22.576 --> 02:23.611
>> NO, I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY.

02:23.611 --> 02:24.945
HOW IS MALCOLM?

02:24.945 --> 02:26.079
>> MOODY AS HELL WITH EVERYTHING

02:26.079 --> 02:27.548
GOING ON.

02:27.548 --> 02:30.017
HIS DAD, NAOMI, THE BUSINESS.

02:30.017 --> 02:31.685
BUT HE'LL BE OKAY, THOUGH.

02:31.685 --> 02:33.020
HE'S A STRONG MAN.

02:33.020 --> 02:34.822
>> WHO HAS A STRONG WOMAN.

02:34.822 --> 02:36.023
>> SEE, MY NEXT RELATIONSHIP

02:36.023 --> 02:36.924
NEEDS TO BE SUPPORTIVE LIKE

02:36.924 --> 02:37.791
THAT.

02:37.791 --> 02:38.692
>> YEAH, WELL, WHAT ABOUT THE

02:38.692 --> 02:39.560
NEW GUY?

02:39.560 --> 02:40.461
UM, GRANT.

02:40.461 --> 02:42.029
>> MM, WE'LL SEE.

02:42.029 --> 02:43.030
YOU KNOW, HE'S LETTING ME PACE

02:43.030 --> 02:43.931
OUT THE RELATIONSHIP, WHICH I

02:43.931 --> 02:45.299
LIKE.

02:45.299 --> 02:46.367
BUT YOU KNOW, HE'S VERY

02:46.367 --> 02:47.801
DEFERENTIAL.

02:47.801 --> 02:48.902
>> WELL, I LIKE A TAKE CHARGE

02:48.902 --> 02:50.371
KIND OF GUY MYSELF.

02:50.371 --> 02:51.372
>> I HEAR YOU.

02:51.372 --> 02:52.039
AND USUALLY I DO TOO, BUT I

02:52.039 --> 02:53.374
GOTTA TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

02:53.374 --> 02:54.408
I MEAN, IF I KEEP GOING AFTER

02:54.408 --> 02:55.409
THE SAME GUYS, I'M GONNA END UP

02:55.409 --> 02:56.076
IN THE SAME KIND OF

02:56.076 --> 02:57.077
RELATIONSHIPS.

02:57.077 --> 02:58.346
>> WHAT KIND IS THAT?

02:58.346 --> 02:59.713
>> THE ONES THAT DON'T WORK.

02:59.713 --> 03:00.881
>> YEAH, MM-HMM.

03:00.881 --> 03:01.749
>> YEAH.

03:01.749 --> 03:02.616
>> [laughs]

03:02.616 --> 03:05.553
>> I'LL GO WITH THAT.

03:05.553 --> 03:06.720
>> SO FELICIA DOESN'T JUST

03:06.720 --> 03:08.456
REPRESENT ARTISTS, SHE ALSO DOES

03:08.456 --> 03:09.890
BRANDING, SHE HAS HER HAND IN

03:09.890 --> 03:11.058
FASHION, SHE PRODUCES TELEVISION

03:11.058 --> 03:11.925
SHOWS.

03:11.925 --> 03:13.461
>> YEAH, YEAH, PRICE MANAGEMENT

03:13.461 --> 03:14.662
IS DIVERSIFIED.

03:14.662 --> 03:16.997
WE HAVE INROADS INTO ANY

03:16.997 --> 03:18.899
INDUSTRY YOU WANT.

03:18.899 --> 03:21.001
TELENOVELAS? WE GOT THAT.

03:21.001 --> 03:22.570
>> WHICH MEANS THE SERGIO BRAND

03:22.570 --> 03:24.638
WILL BE GOING MULTI-PLATFORM.

03:24.638 --> 03:26.173
>> MM.

03:26.173 --> 03:27.741
WELL, AFTER SEEING THIS PLACE,

03:27.741 --> 03:31.512
AND AFTER MEETING WITH EVERYONE,

03:31.512 --> 03:32.413
HOW COULD I NOT SIGN HERE?

03:32.413 --> 03:33.080
>> WHOO!

03:33.080 --> 03:34.081
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

03:34.081 --> 03:35.082
HEY, YOU MADE A GREAT CHOICE.

03:35.082 --> 03:35.983
CONGRATULATIONS.

03:35.983 --> 03:36.917
>> YEAH, CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU

03:36.917 --> 03:37.785
TOO.

03:37.785 --> 03:38.752
I'M ABOUT TO TWEET THIS TO MY

03:38.752 --> 03:39.653
5 MILLION FOLLOWERS.

03:39.653 --> 03:40.521

03:45.092 --> 03:46.760
>> AH, I HAD A FEELING YOU'D

03:46.760 --> 03:47.761
MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION.

03:47.761 --> 03:48.862
IN FACT, I'VE ALREADY NOTIFIED

03:48.862 --> 03:49.963
MY PEOPLE TO START PLANNING YOUR

03:49.963 --> 03:50.931

HEY, IS THERE ANYTHING SPECIAL

03:55.836 --> 03:56.704

03:57.571 --> 03:58.472
>> YES, AS A MATTER OF FACT I

03:58.472 --> 03:59.373

03:59.373 --> 04:00.841
I WOULD LIKE APRIL TO ACCOMPANY

04:00.841 --> 04:01.709

04:01.709 --> 04:02.576

>> OH. WHOA.

04:03.811 --> 04:05.646
DON'T MEAN TO BE A HATER, BUT WE

04:05.646 --> 04:06.714
HAVE A STRICT POLICY ABOUT

04:06.714 --> 04:08.115
FRATERNIZING WITH CLIENTS.

04:08.115 --> 04:09.216
SORRY, YOUR SERGINESS.

04:09.216 --> 04:10.484
CAN'T HAPPEN.

04:10.484 --> 04:11.452
>> HE'S ASKING ME TO ACCOMPANY

04:11.452 --> 04:12.786
HIM TO HIS SIGNING PARTY, DAVID.

04:12.786 --> 04:14.187
NOT A CANDLELIT DINNER FOR TWO.

04:14.187 --> 04:15.188
>> ALTHOUGH WE COULD ALWAYS DO

04:15.188 --> 04:16.557
THAT BEFORE THE PARTY.

04:16.557 --> 04:17.458
OR AFTER.

04:17.458 --> 04:18.158
>> WELL, I WOULD LOVE TO GO TO

04:18.158 --> 04:19.092
THE PARTY WITH YOU, SO I WILL

04:23.230 --> 04:24.598
LOS ANGELES WITH YOU, I WOULDN'T

04:24.598 --> 04:25.733
HAVE HAD TO FLY ALL THE WAY TO

04:25.733 --> 04:27.935
ATLANTA TO SIGN A CONTRACT.

04:27.935 --> 04:29.737
HASTA LUEGO, MI AMOR.

04:29.737 --> 04:32.973

HEY, WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT?

04:36.510 --> 04:37.578
LOOK, WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE

04:37.578 --> 04:38.546
SHARING A CLIENT.

04:38.546 --> 04:39.680
YOU'RE TRYING TO SQUEEZE ME OUT.

04:39.680 --> 04:40.781
>> NO, I'M NOT.

04:40.781 --> 04:41.715
>> YES, YOU ARE.

04:41.715 --> 04:42.650
I SAW THE WAY YOU UNDRESSED HIM

04:42.650 --> 04:43.517
WITH YOUR EYES.

04:43.517 --> 04:44.618
HE DAMN NEAR SALSA'D OUT OF HERE

04:44.618 --> 04:45.486
BUTT-NAKED!

04:45.486 --> 04:46.454
>> IT'S CALLED MAINTAINING EYE

04:46.454 --> 04:47.120
CONTACT.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.121
>> NO, YOU'RE TRYING TO USE THE

04:48.121 --> 04:48.989
P-CARD.

04:48.989 --> 04:49.857
>> THE WHAT?

04:49.857 --> 04:50.724
>> YOU KNOW THE P--

04:50.724 --> 04:51.592
>> OKAY, I GET IT.

04:51.592 --> 04:52.460
I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS.

04:52.460 --> 04:53.527
AND DON'T ACT LIKE YOU WOULDN'T

04:53.527 --> 04:55.929
USE THE D-CARD OR THE C-CARD.

04:55.929 --> 04:57.631
WHAT? OR THE P-CARD...

04:57.631 --> 04:58.932
WHATEVER, THE SEX CARD, IF HE

04:58.932 --> 04:59.900
WAS A WOMAN.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.001
AND IF HE WAS A MAN, YOU'D USE

05:01.001 --> 05:02.536
THE WHOLE DECK OF CARDS.

05:02.536 --> 05:04.071
>> AH, BECAUSE I USED THE D-CARD

05:04.071 --> 05:05.138
ON YOU YOU GOT A PROBLEM WITH

05:05.138 --> 05:08.809
IT, HUH?

05:20.287 --> 05:21.989
>> BRINGING ME TO YOUR OFFICE,

05:21.989 --> 05:24.625
DEACON, ISN'T EXACTLY THE

05:24.625 --> 05:26.927
SMARTEST THING TO DO RIGHT NOW.

05:26.927 --> 05:28.862
>> OH, I KNOW.

05:28.862 --> 05:30.964
AND IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

05:30.964 --> 05:32.265
>> SO WHAT DO YOU WANT?

05:32.265 --> 05:34.568
>> SHH. HOLD THAT THOUGHT.

05:34.568 --> 05:35.636
>> I ALREADY TOLD YOU, MAN.

05:35.636 --> 05:36.570
GET YOUR HANDS UP OFF ME.

05:36.570 --> 05:37.738
>> DEACON, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

05:37.738 --> 05:38.706
>> GETTING US ALL ON THE SAME

05:38.706 --> 05:39.640
PAGE.

05:39.640 --> 05:40.608
>> I DON'T WANT TO BE ON THE

05:40.608 --> 05:41.542
SAME PAGE AS YOU.

05:41.542 --> 05:42.576
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO BE IN THE

05:42.576 --> 05:43.811
SAME BOOK AS YOU!

05:43.811 --> 05:46.179
>> YEAH. IT'S TOO LATE, THOUGH.

05:46.179 --> 05:48.849
SEE, ME AND MALCOLM, WE'RE

05:48.849 --> 05:51.051
ALREADY ON THE SAME PAGE.

05:51.051 --> 05:52.152
RIGHT, MALCOLM?

05:52.152 --> 05:53.186
>> WHAT IS HE TALKING ABOUT?

05:53.186 --> 05:55.088
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

05:55.088 --> 05:56.156
>> DEACON WAS THE ONE WHO

05:56.156 --> 05:57.525
ASSURED ME OF YOUR PROTECTION IN

05:57.525 --> 05:58.626
PRISON, T.

05:58.626 --> 05:59.727
I KNOW WHAT HAPPENS INSIDE, AND

05:59.727 --> 06:00.861
I WASN'T ABOUT TO LET IT HAPPEN

06:00.861 --> 06:02.029
TO MY KID BROTHER.

06:02.029 --> 06:03.196
>> SO YOU GOT MIXED UP WITH HIM

06:03.196 --> 06:04.231
TO KEEP ME SAFE?

06:04.231 --> 06:06.199
>> OH, NO, NO. NO.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.935
WE'VE BEEN IN BUSINESS A LONG

06:07.935 --> 06:08.969
TIME.

06:08.969 --> 06:09.903
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, DEACON?

06:09.903 --> 06:10.771
>> WHAT IS HE TALKING ABOUT,

06:10.771 --> 06:12.005
MALCOLM?

06:12.005 --> 06:13.073
>> DON'T WORRY ABOUT WHAT HE'S

06:13.073 --> 06:14.975
TALKING ABOUT, T.

06:14.975 --> 06:16.009
LISTEN, YOU'RE OUT OF PRISON

06:16.009 --> 06:17.310
NOW, OKAY?

06:17.310 --> 06:18.579
YOU'RE OUT OF PRISON, AND ALL I

06:18.579 --> 06:20.347
WANT TO DO IS KEEP YOU OUT.

06:20.347 --> 06:22.783
>> THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

06:22.783 --> 06:24.785
I GO LEGIT, AND YOU'VE BEEN

06:24.785 --> 06:27.187
CROOKED THE ENTIRE TIME.

06:27.187 --> 06:28.088
MR. HIGH AND MIGHTY IS A

06:28.088 --> 06:29.990
CRIMINAL.

06:29.990 --> 06:33.193
WITH HIM!

06:33.193 --> 06:34.127
>> DOES POPS KNOW?

06:34.127 --> 06:35.829
>> OF COURSE POPS DIDN'T KNOW.

06:35.829 --> 06:40.067
>> OF COURSE HE DIDN'T.

06:40.067 --> 06:42.970
>> TERRENCE, LOOK AT ME.

06:42.970 --> 06:46.540
LOOK AT ME, T.

06:46.540 --> 06:47.875
CORPORATE BUSINESS IS VERY

06:47.875 --> 06:48.742
COMPLICATED.

06:48.742 --> 06:50.010
>> BUSINESS IS COMPLICATED?

06:50.010 --> 06:53.714
LIFE IS COMPLICATED, MALCOLM!

06:53.714 --> 06:55.082
>> WHEN I TRIED TO EXPAND

06:55.082 --> 06:57.851
FRANK'S JEWELS, NO BANK WOULD

06:57.851 --> 06:58.786
HELP ME.

06:58.786 --> 07:00.153
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

07:00.153 --> 07:01.622
NO ONE HELPED.

07:01.622 --> 07:04.124
SO YEAH. YEAH, I GOT CREATIVE.

07:04.124 --> 07:05.092
>> I THOUGHT YOU WERE BETTER

07:05.092 --> 07:05.993
THAN THAT, MAN!

07:05.993 --> 07:07.127
>> YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY BE THIS

07:07.127 --> 07:07.995
NAIVE.

07:07.995 --> 07:09.196
>> OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

07:09.196 --> 07:11.198
LOOK, YOU TWO CAN WORK OUT YOUR

07:11.198 --> 07:13.934
LITTLE FAMILY DRAMA ON YOUR OWN

07:13.934 --> 07:14.868
TIME.

07:14.868 --> 07:15.736
>> WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM US,

07:15.736 --> 07:17.370
DEACON?

07:17.370 --> 07:19.139
>> DADDY'S DEAD.

07:19.139 --> 07:20.207
THAT LEAVES AN EXTRA PIECE OF

07:20.207 --> 07:22.743
THE PIE, AND I WANT IT.

07:22.743 --> 07:24.812
LIKE I WANT A PIECE OF CUT.

07:24.812 --> 07:26.413
>> DEACON, YOU KNOW THE D.A.

07:26.413 --> 07:27.715
WANTS YOU JUST AS BADLY AS THEY

07:27.715 --> 07:29.717
WANT ME, RIGHT?

07:29.717 --> 07:30.417
>> MM.

07:30.417 --> 07:33.086
>> SO LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.

07:33.086 --> 07:36.657
IF WE PART WAYS NOW, I PROMISE

07:36.657 --> 07:37.691
THAT I'LL TAKE ALL THE HEAT FOR

07:37.691 --> 07:40.127
THE INVESTIGATION.

07:40.127 --> 07:41.261
I'LL EVEN GO TO PRISON IF IT

07:41.261 --> 07:42.129
COMES DOWN TO THAT.

07:42.129 --> 07:43.030
>> MALCOLM--

07:43.030 --> 07:45.232
>> TERRENCE, I'M TALKING.

07:45.232 --> 07:46.800
SO I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT YOUR

07:46.800 --> 07:50.003
NAME WILL NEVER BE MENTIONED.

07:50.003 --> 07:51.672
>> HOW CAN I BE SO SURE?

07:51.672 --> 07:52.940
>> YOU HAVE MY WORD, DEACON,

07:52.940 --> 07:53.941
WHICH HAS ALWAYS BEEN GOOD FOR

07:53.941 --> 07:55.308
YOU BEFORE.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.010
BUT OUTSIDE OF THAT, DEACON--

07:57.010 --> 07:58.278
I WANT YOU TO HEAR THIS.

07:58.278 --> 08:01.448
OUTSIDE OF THAT, YOU AND I ARE

08:01.448 --> 08:06.086
DONE.

08:06.086 --> 08:09.156
>> DONE.

08:09.156 --> 08:10.290
>> WE'RE DONE WHEN I SAY WE'RE

08:10.290 --> 08:11.992
DONE.

08:15.763 --> 08:16.830
>> * THAT'S WHY HE'S *

08:16.830 --> 08:18.932
* STAYING MINE

08:18.932 --> 08:21.802
* GIVE IT LIKE HE LIKES

08:21.802 --> 08:23.270
>> * BABY, DON'T WE KNOW *

08:23.270 --> 08:24.705
>> * I KNOW

08:24.705 --> 08:29.777
* HOW TO FREAK HIM SLOW

08:29.777 --> 08:30.778
* THAT IS WHY

08:30.778 --> 08:33.981
* HE'LL ALWAYS BE MINE *

08:33.981 --> 08:35.348
>> HI. OH.

08:35.348 --> 08:36.750
>> WOW.

08:36.750 --> 08:37.818
>> WOW.

08:37.818 --> 08:39.119
>> OH, I'M SORRY.

08:39.119 --> 08:40.120
I SHOULD'VE TOLD YOU WHAT I WAS

08:40.120 --> 08:41.354
PLANNING FOR OUR DATE.

08:41.354 --> 08:43.924
>> NO WORRIES. I CAN CHANGE.

08:43.924 --> 08:45.192
>> BUT YOU LOOK SO GORGEOUS IN

08:45.192 --> 08:47.027
THAT DRESS.

08:47.027 --> 08:48.395
>> THANK YOU.

08:48.395 --> 08:49.830
BUT I GUESS THAT'LL HAVE TO BE

08:49.830 --> 08:50.998
PUNISHMENT FOR NOT GIVING ME A

08:50.998 --> 08:51.865
HEADS UP.

08:51.865 --> 08:52.966
NO DRESS FOR YOU.

08:52.966 --> 08:54.234
>> WELL, IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

08:54.234 --> 08:55.335
SCOUT'S HONOR.

08:55.335 --> 08:57.270
>> [chuckles] HAVE A SEAT.

08:57.270 --> 08:58.672
I WON'T MAKE YOU WAIT TOO LONG.

08:58.672 --> 09:00.741
>> OH, I HOPE NOT.

09:00.741 --> 09:01.742
>> * DO YOUR THING

09:01.742 --> 09:02.475
* DO YOUR THING

09:02.475 --> 09:03.343
* DO IT

09:03.343 --> 09:04.211
* PARTY ALL NIGHT

09:04.211 --> 09:05.478
* YEAH, LET'S GET STUPID *

09:05.478 --> 09:06.947
* DO YOUR THING, DO YOUR THING

09:06.947 --> 09:07.815
* DO IT

09:07.815 --> 09:08.816
>> IT'LL ONLY BE A MINUTE.

09:08.816 --> 09:09.983
I PROMISE.

09:09.983 --> 09:11.084
FELICIA NEEDS ME.

09:11.084 --> 09:12.152
>> I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT WAS SO

09:12.152 --> 09:13.120
IMPORTANT THAT SHE NEEDED YOU TO

09:13.120 --> 09:14.121
DROP EVERYTHING AND COME OVER

09:14.121 --> 09:15.956
AFTER BUSINESS HOURS.

09:15.956 --> 09:17.357
>> OMAR! THERE YOU ARE.

09:17.357 --> 09:18.458
I JUST HAD AN EPIPHANY, AND I

09:18.458 --> 09:20.293
NEED YOUR ASSISTANCE RIGHT AWAY.

09:20.293 --> 09:21.228
>> I'M ALL EARS.

09:21.228 --> 09:22.763
>> OKAY, SO I WAS AT THE FOUR

09:22.763 --> 09:24.932
SEASONS VISITING A CLIENT, AND

09:24.932 --> 09:26.066
THE GIRL AT THE FRONT DESK

09:26.066 --> 09:27.467
REFUSED TO LET ME UPSTAIRS.

09:27.467 --> 09:28.869
I HATE DEALING WITH COMMON FOLK.

09:28.869 --> 09:29.803
>> I KNOW, ALL THOSE HORRIBLE

09:29.803 --> 09:30.804
PEOPLE DOING THEIR JOBS.

09:30.804 --> 09:31.739
>> SO ONE THING LED TO ANOTHER,

09:31.739 --> 09:32.472
I MIGHT'VE THROWN MY PHONE--

09:32.472 --> 09:33.340
WHO CAN REMEMBER?

09:33.340 --> 09:34.942
ANYWAYS, AS I'M STANDING OVER

09:34.942 --> 09:36.910
HER PORTLY BODY, INSPIRATION

09:36.910 --> 09:38.211
STRUCK.

09:38.211 --> 09:39.479
I HAD MY ASSISTANT PRY THAT OUT

09:39.479 --> 09:40.848
OF THE FLOOR OF THE LOBBY.

09:40.848 --> 09:41.982
ISN'T THE COLOR REMARKABLE?

09:41.982 --> 09:42.883
>> YEAH.

09:42.883 --> 09:43.817
>> AND YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I HATE

09:43.817 --> 09:45.118
COLOR.

09:45.118 --> 09:46.419
>> YOU HAD HIM PRY THIS FROM THE

09:46.419 --> 09:47.287
FLOOR?

09:47.287 --> 09:48.388
>> WELL, HE DIDN'T HAVE THE

09:48.388 --> 09:49.522
STRENGTH, SO I HAD CHUBBS AT THE

09:49.522 --> 09:51.759
FRONT DESK DO IT.

09:51.759 --> 09:53.026
WHAT?

09:53.026 --> 09:54.427
SHE WAS ALREADY DOWN THERE.

09:54.427 --> 09:56.396
LOOK, THE POINT IS WHATEVER YOU

09:56.396 --> 09:57.364
HAD PLANNED FOR ME TO WEAR

09:57.364 --> 09:58.999
TOMORROW NIGHT AT SERGIO'S

09:58.999 --> 10:00.834
PARTY, FORGET IT.

10:00.834 --> 10:02.535
YOUR NEW MISSION IS TO MAKE ME

10:02.535 --> 10:04.371
SOMETHING ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS

10:04.371 --> 10:08.408
USING THAT TILE AS INSPIRATION.

10:08.408 --> 10:11.011
>> FOR TOMORROW?

10:11.011 --> 10:12.179
>> OMAR?

10:12.179 --> 10:17.117
>> IS THERE A PROBLEM?

10:17.117 --> 10:18.451
>> N-NO.

10:18.451 --> 10:19.920
NO, NO PROBLEM AT ALL.

10:19.920 --> 10:20.821
>> GOOD.

10:20.821 --> 10:24.424
GOOD, GOOD, GOOD, GOOD.

10:24.424 --> 10:26.026
OH.

10:26.026 --> 10:28.161
YOUR DRIVER IS SHORT-TEMPERED,

10:28.161 --> 10:31.298
ISN'T HE? [giggles]

10:34.902 --> 10:36.770
>> OKAY, LISTEN.

10:36.770 --> 10:37.871
IF I CAN LIQUIDATE THESE TWO

10:37.871 --> 10:38.872
ACCOUNTS, THEN WE MIGHT HAVE

10:38.872 --> 10:40.340
SOME CASH TO OFFER DEACON, BUT,

10:40.340 --> 10:41.341
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN

10:41.341 --> 10:42.209
OVERNIGHT, T.

10:42.209 --> 10:43.811
>> YOU THINK HE'LL EVEN TAKE IT?

10:43.811 --> 10:44.878
YOU KNOW DEACON, MALCOLM.

10:44.878 --> 10:45.846
HE'S GONNA WANT MORE THAN THE

10:45.846 --> 10:46.880
ONE-TIME PAYOUT.

10:46.880 --> 10:47.915
HE WANTS THE RESIDUAL INCOME.

10:47.915 --> 10:49.182
>> I DON'T GIVE A DAMN WHAT

10:49.182 --> 10:50.918
DEACON WANTS.

10:50.918 --> 10:51.985
TERRENCE, DEACON CAN'T GET

10:51.985 --> 10:53.821
ANYWHERE NEAR OUR BUSINESS.

10:53.821 --> 10:56.089
YOU UNDERSTAND?

10:56.089 --> 10:57.290
>> THAT'S THE FIRST TIME YOU

10:57.290 --> 10:58.859
CALLED IT OURS.

10:58.859 --> 11:02.195
>> IT'S ALWAYS BEEN OURS.

11:02.195 --> 11:03.263
I JUST HAVE TO CLEAN UP THIS

11:03.263 --> 11:04.131
MESS THAT I MADE.

11:04.131 --> 11:05.065
>> MAYBE IF YOU WOULD'VE TOLD ME

11:05.065 --> 11:05.966
EARLIER, MALCOLM, THERE'S

11:05.966 --> 11:06.900
SOMETHING I COULD'VE DONE TO

11:06.900 --> 11:07.768
HELP.

11:07.768 --> 11:08.836
>> YOU DIDN'T DO THIS, T.

11:08.836 --> 11:10.303
I DID.

11:10.303 --> 11:11.839
>> LOOK, WE BOTH HAD OUR SHARE

11:11.839 --> 11:13.106
OF MESSES.

11:13.106 --> 11:15.408
BUT WE'RE IN THIS ONE TOGETHER.

11:15.408 --> 11:17.310
IF I RECALL CORRECTLY, POPS

11:17.310 --> 11:18.946
DIDN'T RAISE NO PUNKS.

11:18.946 --> 11:21.414
>> [chuckles] YEAH.

11:21.414 --> 11:22.349
FRANKS.

11:22.349 --> 11:25.485
>> FRANKS.

11:30.557 --> 11:33.126
[both laughing]

11:33.126 --> 11:34.127
>> OH, MY GOD, THAT WAS SO MUCH

11:34.127 --> 11:34.995
FUN.

11:34.995 --> 11:36.063
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'VE NEVER BEEN

11:36.063 --> 11:37.430
TO THE FERNBANK OBSERVATORY.

11:37.430 --> 11:38.832
>> WITH THE LARGEST TELESCOPE IN

11:38.832 --> 11:40.167
THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES.

11:40.167 --> 11:41.034
>> MM-HMM.

11:41.034 --> 11:41.902
[chuckles] THEY WERE REALLY

11:41.902 --> 11:42.936
PROUD ABOUT THAT.

11:42.936 --> 11:44.104
>> YEAH, YOU KNOW US MEN.

11:44.104 --> 11:45.038
WE LOVE IT WHEN WE HAVE THE

11:45.038 --> 11:46.106
BIGGEST ANYTHING.

11:46.106 --> 11:46.974
>> YEAH, YOU DO.

11:46.974 --> 11:48.909
[both laugh]

11:48.909 --> 11:51.011
BY THE WAY, I AM REALLY HAPPY

11:51.011 --> 11:51.945
THAT I CHANGED MY OUTFIT,

11:51.945 --> 11:53.080
BECAUSE THE OTHER ONE WASN'T

11:53.080 --> 11:55.148
EXACTLY, UH, FAMILY-FRIENDLY.

11:55.148 --> 11:56.116
>> THAT'S MY FAULT.

11:56.116 --> 11:57.117
I SHOULD'VE TOLD YOU WHAT I HAD

11:57.117 --> 11:58.085
PLANNED.

11:58.085 --> 11:59.052
>> SOUNDS LIKE I'VE GOT SOME

11:59.052 --> 12:00.187
TRAINING TO DO.

12:00.187 --> 12:01.554
>> IS THAT SO?

12:01.554 --> 12:02.455
>> [laughs]

12:02.455 --> 12:03.323
NO, I'M JUST KIDDING.

12:03.323 --> 12:06.426
>> OH, I HOPE NOT.

12:12.866 --> 12:15.002
>> YOU KNOW, I USED TO THINK YOU

12:15.002 --> 12:17.104
LOOKED GOOD IN A SUIT.

12:17.104 --> 12:20.373
BUT AFTER GOING A FEW ROUNDS, I

12:20.373 --> 12:21.508
THINK YOU LOOK BETTER WITHOUT

12:21.508 --> 12:22.976
IT.

12:22.976 --> 12:24.211
>> WELL, I ALWAYS KNEW YOU HAD

12:24.211 --> 12:25.112
GOOD TASTE.

12:25.112 --> 12:27.915
>> [chuckles]

12:27.915 --> 12:29.516
AND I TASTE GOOD.

12:29.516 --> 12:32.986
>> NO, YOU TASTE REALLY GOOD.

12:32.986 --> 12:34.988
>> AND I'M GOOD AT A LOT OF

12:34.988 --> 12:37.090
OTHER THINGS.

12:37.090 --> 12:40.127
>> AND A FEW THINGS BETTER.

12:40.127 --> 12:41.628
>> MM.

12:41.628 --> 12:43.530
NO, NO, NO, NO, I CAN'T.

12:43.530 --> 12:44.865
>> WHAT?

12:44.865 --> 12:45.632
>> I HAVE TO THINK ABOUT GETTING

12:45.632 --> 12:47.200
THIS PLACE PACKED UP.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.201
THE MOVERS COME AT THE END OF

12:48.201 --> 12:49.269
THE WEEK.

12:49.269 --> 12:50.871
>> HAVE YOU FOUND A PLACE YET?

12:50.871 --> 12:51.972
>> I DON'T HAVE ANY DEFINITE

12:51.972 --> 12:53.306
PLANS UNTIL WE GET SOME MONEY

12:53.306 --> 12:55.042
FROM THE CASE.

12:55.042 --> 12:56.443
>> AH...

12:56.443 --> 12:58.478
WELL, THAT'S NOT AS EASY AS IT

12:58.478 --> 13:02.182
SOUNDS.

13:02.182 --> 13:05.853
I CAN ONLY DO SO MUCH.

13:07.354 --> 13:10.891
I DON'T HAVE A LOT TO WORK WITH.

13:10.891 --> 13:12.192
>> WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO,

13:12.192 --> 13:14.227
SEAN?

13:14.227 --> 13:16.129
I FEEL ALL ALONE IN THIS.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.966
>> NAOMI.

13:18.966 --> 13:21.368
LOOK, COME ON.

13:21.368 --> 13:23.470
LOOK, I'M NOT MAC.

13:23.470 --> 13:27.007
I CAN'T BE YOUR SUGAR DADDY.

13:27.007 --> 13:29.009
LOOK, YOU'RE RESOURCEFUL.

13:29.009 --> 13:32.512
YOU'LL THINK OF SOMETHING.

13:43.156 --> 13:45.158
>> HEY.

13:45.158 --> 13:46.093
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

13:46.093 --> 13:47.494
>> FELICIA NEEDS SHOES.

13:47.494 --> 13:48.528
I THOUGHT YOU WERE ALREADY AT

13:48.528 --> 13:49.396
WORK.

13:49.396 --> 13:50.530
>> YEAH, NO, I WANTED TO STOP BY

13:50.530 --> 13:51.464
AND GET SOME ADVICE.

13:51.464 --> 13:53.200
SO I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

13:53.200 --> 13:54.434
OKAY, SO THERE'S THIS SIGNING

13:54.434 --> 13:55.368
PARTY THAT WE'RE HAVING FOR

13:55.368 --> 13:56.703
SERGIO TONIGHT, OUR NEW CLIENT,

13:56.703 --> 13:58.371
AND HE KIND OF SORT OF ASKED ME

13:58.371 --> 14:00.207
TO BE HIS DATE.

14:00.207 --> 14:01.541
>> WEAR SOMETHING SEXY, BUT NOT

14:01.541 --> 14:02.542
SLUTTY.

14:02.542 --> 14:03.743
HE'S LATIN, SO HE WAS RAISED

14:03.743 --> 14:04.777
CATHOLIC, WHICH MEANS HE HAS

14:04.777 --> 14:06.379
THAT WHOLE MADONNA/WHORE THING

14:06.379 --> 14:07.280
GOING ON.

14:07.280 --> 14:08.515
>> NOT FASHION ADVICE, OMAR,

14:08.515 --> 14:09.682
CAREER ADVICE.

14:09.682 --> 14:10.683
>> OH.

14:10.683 --> 14:11.551
>> I JUST FEEL LIKE DATING A

14:11.551 --> 14:12.685
CLIENT IS A LINE THAT I PROBABLY

14:12.685 --> 14:13.686
SHOULDN'T BE CROSSING.

14:13.686 --> 14:16.189
>> THEN DON'T.

14:16.189 --> 14:17.124
>> [clears throat]

14:17.124 --> 14:19.292
EXCUSE ME, BUT HAVE YOU SEEN A

14:19.292 --> 14:20.493
PICTURE OF SERGIO?

14:20.493 --> 14:21.694
GIRL, YOU NEED TO GOOGLE HIM,

14:21.694 --> 14:22.729
'CAUSE I DON'T THINK YOU KNOW

14:22.729 --> 14:24.197
WHO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

14:24.197 --> 14:26.399
>> OH, I KNOW EXACTLY WHO HE IS.

14:26.399 --> 14:27.700
I ALSO KNOW THAT DIPPING YOUR

14:27.700 --> 14:29.202
PEN IN THE COMPANY INK IS NEVER

14:29.202 --> 14:30.403
A GOOD THING, ESPECIALLY FOR

14:30.403 --> 14:31.271
WOMEN.

14:31.271 --> 14:33.040
IT ALWAYS ENDS UP BACKFIRING.

14:33.040 --> 14:34.041
>> WELL, I DON'T REALLY HAVE A

14:34.041 --> 14:35.442
PEN TO DIP, SO--

14:35.442 --> 14:36.743
>> YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, GIRL.

14:36.743 --> 14:38.711
LOOK, LET'S SAY YOU GUYS DATE

14:38.711 --> 14:40.147
FOR A HOT MINUTE, RIGHT?

14:40.147 --> 14:41.281
AND THEN YOU BREAK UP.

14:41.281 --> 14:42.549
AND THEN HE'S ALL SOURED OVER

14:42.549 --> 14:43.583
PRICE MANAGEMENT?

14:43.583 --> 14:45.018
I MEAN, IT'S A MESS, APRIL.

14:45.018 --> 14:46.253
>> OR YOU FALL IN LOVE, GET

14:46.253 --> 14:48.088
MARRIED, AND LIVE FILTHILY RICH

14:48.088 --> 14:49.389
EVER AFTER.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.324
>> OOH. I LIKE WHAT HE SAID.

14:51.324 --> 14:53.526
>> AND, EXCUSE ME, BUT DIDN'T

14:53.526 --> 14:54.661
YOU JUST GET OUT OF A

14:54.661 --> 14:56.263
BUSINESS/PERSONAL THING WITH

14:56.263 --> 14:57.130
TERRENCE?

14:57.130 --> 14:58.031
>> TERRENCE AND I WERE NEVER A

14:58.031 --> 14:59.332
THING.

14:59.332 --> 15:01.268
SECONDLY, THAT'S EXACTLY HOW I

15:01.268 --> 15:02.635
KNOW SHE'S MAKING A MISTAKE:

15:02.635 --> 15:04.371
EXPERIENCE.

15:04.371 --> 15:05.638
MOVING ON FROM TERRENCE WAS THE

15:05.638 --> 15:06.739
RIGHT THING TO DO.

15:06.739 --> 15:07.740
>> PERSONALLY, I DON'T SEE

15:07.740 --> 15:09.076
ANYTHING WRONG WITH MIXING A

15:09.076 --> 15:10.743
LITTLE BUSINESS AND PLEASURE AS

15:10.743 --> 15:13.080
LONG AS YOU HOLD ONTO THE POWER.

15:13.080 --> 15:13.746
>> SEE?

15:13.746 --> 15:15.248
THAT'S WHY GRANT AND I AREN'T

15:15.248 --> 15:16.716
MIXING BUSINESS WITH PLEASURE--

15:16.716 --> 15:17.750
SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY

15:17.750 --> 15:19.052
ABOUT THE POWER DYNAMICS.

15:19.052 --> 15:19.752
WE CAN JUST FOCUS ON THE

15:19.752 --> 15:20.620
PLEASURE.

15:20.620 --> 15:21.488
>> MM.

15:21.488 --> 15:22.422
>> LIKE LAST NIGHT HE TOOK ME TO

15:22.422 --> 15:23.690
THE FERNBANK OBSERVATORY.

15:23.690 --> 15:25.792
[sighs] AND WE JUST HUNG OUT AND

15:25.792 --> 15:27.260
WE STARED AT THE STARS, AND IT

15:27.260 --> 15:30.163
WAS SO ROMANTIC.

15:30.163 --> 15:31.031
>> [snaps]

15:31.031 --> 15:32.199
CAN YOU SNAP OUT OF IT, PLEASE?

15:32.199 --> 15:33.400
APRIL NEEDS ADVICE.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.135
>> APRIL NEEDS TO GO TO WORK, SO

15:35.135 --> 15:36.636
THANK YOU, GUYS.

15:36.636 --> 15:38.405
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA

15:38.405 --> 15:40.473
DO, BUT IF THIS ALL BLOWS UP IN

15:40.473 --> 15:42.175
MY FACE, I'M GONNA BLAME ONE OF

15:42.175 --> 15:45.012
YOU.

15:50.583 --> 15:53.753
>> [knocks]

15:53.753 --> 15:54.821
>> WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING

15:54.821 --> 15:55.722
IN HERE?

15:55.722 --> 15:56.623
>> IS THAT ANY WAY TO SPEAK TO

15:56.623 --> 15:57.624
YOUR STEPMOTHER?

15:57.624 --> 15:58.591
>> OH, YOU'RE DEFINITELY A

15:58.591 --> 15:59.792
MOTHER OF SOME SORT.

15:59.792 --> 16:00.827
>> I KNOW YOU WANT ME OUT OF

16:00.827 --> 16:02.529
YOUR LIFE.

16:02.529 --> 16:03.530
AND I WOULD LOVE TO GO, BUT I

16:03.530 --> 16:04.731
NEED THE FINANCES TO DO SO.

16:04.731 --> 16:05.765
>> NAOMI, WE'VE ALREADY HAD THIS

16:05.765 --> 16:06.799
DISCUSSION, AND I'M NOT GIVING

16:06.799 --> 16:08.568
YOU A DIME.

16:08.568 --> 16:10.270
>> I KNOW THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK.

16:10.270 --> 16:12.172
ESPECIALLY SINCE YOU EMPTIED THE

16:12.172 --> 16:14.241
SAFE AND PROBABLY DESTROYED ALL

16:14.241 --> 16:15.508
THE EVIDENCE OF MY MARRIAGE TO

16:15.508 --> 16:18.678
MAC.

16:22.382 --> 16:26.253
>> IN OTHER WORDS, THIS IS OVER.

16:26.253 --> 16:28.655
AND YOUR MARRIAGE CLAIM IS DEAD.

16:28.655 --> 16:29.856
>> HM.

16:29.856 --> 16:31.391
BUT THE INVESTIGATION INTO YOUR

16:31.391 --> 16:34.261
FINANCES ISN'T.

16:39.632 --> 16:42.135
[sighs]

16:42.135 --> 16:44.437
YOU'RE A LOT OF THINGS, MALCOLM.

16:44.437 --> 16:46.406
STUPID ISN'T ONE OF THEM.

16:46.406 --> 16:47.674
AND YOU KNOW THAT I HAVE MORE

16:47.674 --> 16:48.841
THAN ENOUGH ON THIS COMPANY TO

16:48.841 --> 16:51.578
BLOW THE WHOLE THING APART.

16:51.578 --> 16:52.679
YOU DON'T WANT ME HELPING THE

16:52.679 --> 16:54.281
D.A., DO YOU?

16:54.281 --> 16:55.782
>> OH, NAOMI, YOU GO RIGHT

16:55.782 --> 16:58.151
AHEAD.

16:58.151 --> 16:59.319
BECAUSE YOU'LL BE BLOWING

16:59.319 --> 17:02.889
YOURSELF UP IN THE PROCESS.

17:07.860 --> 17:09.896
>> HOW DID WE GET TO THIS?

17:09.896 --> 17:10.863
>> HM.

17:10.863 --> 17:13.333
>> WE USED TO BE FRIENDS.

17:13.333 --> 17:14.767
WE USED TO BE MORE THAN JUST

17:14.767 --> 17:18.771
FRIENDS.

17:21.674 --> 17:24.777
>> OH, HELL NO.

17:24.777 --> 17:29.282
>> KEISHA.

17:36.523 --> 17:37.724
>> YOU REALLY THINK THAT YOU CAN

17:37.724 --> 17:38.725
JUST WALK IN HERE AND--

17:38.725 --> 17:39.759
>> KEISHA, IT'S NOT WHAT YOU

17:39.759 --> 17:42.362
THINK, OKAY?

17:42.362 --> 17:44.297
>> I'M GOING TO LET YOU TWO KIDS

17:44.297 --> 17:46.666
WORK THIS OUT.

17:46.666 --> 17:48.635
>> HEY.

17:48.635 --> 17:49.736
>> MALCOLM, YOU BETTER START

17:49.736 --> 17:50.603
TALKING.

17:50.603 --> 17:51.604
>> OKAY, BUT LET'S NOT DO THIS

17:51.604 --> 17:52.472
HERE.

17:52.472 --> 17:53.340
>> MM-MM.

17:53.340 --> 17:54.474
WE'RE DOING IT RIGHT HERE AND

17:54.474 --> 17:55.808
RIGHT NOW.

17:55.808 --> 17:57.777
>> KEISHA, LET'S--[scoffs]

17:57.777 --> 17:59.679
>> DON'T EVEN.

17:59.679 --> 18:01.248
I GAVE YOU A PASS BECAUSE YOU

18:01.248 --> 18:03.483
WERE UPSET OVER YOUR FATHER.

18:03.483 --> 18:04.651
BUT I CAN TELL.

18:04.651 --> 18:05.818
I CAN TELL YOU'VE BEEN KEEPING

18:05.818 --> 18:06.819
THINGS FROM ME.

18:06.819 --> 18:07.887
>> THERE IS SO MUCH GOING ON

18:07.887 --> 18:08.855
RIGHT NOW THAT I HAVEN'T TOLD

18:08.855 --> 18:09.789
YOU ABOUT.

18:09.789 --> 18:11.291
AND FOR GOOD REASON.

18:11.291 --> 18:12.892
>> THERE IS NO GOOD REASON.

18:12.892 --> 18:14.294
SO YOU BETTER START TELLING ME

18:14.294 --> 18:15.395
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON, AND

18:15.395 --> 18:16.863
YOU BETTER START WITH NAOMI.

18:16.863 --> 18:17.897
>> MALCOLM.

18:17.897 --> 18:19.199
WHATEVER YOU GOT GOING, PUT A

18:19.199 --> 18:20.167
PIN IN IT.

18:20.167 --> 18:20.833
LOOK, I NEED YOUR FULL

18:20.833 --> 18:21.701
ATTENTION.

18:21.701 --> 18:22.802
WE GOT A HUGE PROBLEM.

18:22.802 --> 18:25.238
>> [chuckles] PUT A PIN IN IT?

18:25.238 --> 18:27.274
>> WHAT'S GOING ON, MAN?

18:27.274 --> 18:29.176
>> FOR LEGAL REASONS, SHE CAN'T

18:29.176 --> 18:30.243
HEAR THIS.

18:30.243 --> 18:31.211
>> TRUST ME.

18:31.211 --> 18:33.313
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.

18:33.313 --> 18:37.784
BECAUSE I AM SICK OF IT.

18:50.530 --> 18:52.199
>> I DID WHAT YOU WANTED ME TO

18:52.199 --> 18:53.200
DO.

18:53.200 --> 18:55.435
OKAY, I MARRIED HIM.

18:55.435 --> 18:56.636
NOW I THINK YOU SHOULD PAY ME.

18:56.636 --> 18:58.305
>> YOU DID NOT DO WHAT I WANTED

18:58.305 --> 18:59.206
YOU TO DO.

18:59.206 --> 19:00.740
I TOLD YOU.

19:00.740 --> 19:02.642
YOU MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE

19:02.642 --> 19:03.643
PROOF.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.345
>> I DID HAVE PROOF.

19:05.345 --> 19:06.746
I CAN'T HELP IT IF MALCOLM STOLE

19:06.746 --> 19:07.614

CLEANED OUT THE SAFE AND

YOU CAN'T STOP SOMETHING LIKE

>> YOU'RE REALLY FEELING

20:51.851 --> 20:52.752
YOURSELF, AREN'T YOU?

20:52.752 --> 20:53.853
>> YEAH, WHY WOULDN'T I?

20:53.853 --> 20:54.954
OUR CLIENT'S HAPPY, HIS SONG IS

20:54.954 --> 20:56.222
SLAMMIN'.

20:56.222 --> 20:56.889
>> "SONG IS SLAMMING"?

20:56.889 --> 20:57.957
WHAT, WERE YOU BORN IN THE '70s?

20:57.957 --> 20:58.825
>> [sighs]

20:58.825 --> 20:59.692
>> "OUR CLIENT"?

20:59.692 --> 21:00.693
FOR HOW LONG, APRIL?

21:00.693 --> 21:02.395
BEFORE YOU STEAL HIM FROM ME?

21:02.395 --> 21:03.363
>> THAT AGAIN, DAVID?

21:03.363 --> 21:04.764
WHAT ARE YOU SO ANGRY ABOUT?

21:04.764 --> 21:06.366
IS IT THAT I'M THE CLOSER HERE?

21:06.366 --> 21:07.400
OR IS IT THAT I'M HAVING A GREAT

21:07.400 --> 21:09.402
TIME WITH SERGIO TONIGHT?

21:09.402 --> 21:10.337
>> YOU JUST DON'T GET IT, DO

21:10.337 --> 21:11.003
YOU?

21:11.003 --> 21:12.004
>> OH, NO, I GET IT.

21:12.004 --> 21:13.005
YOU'RE NOT WORRIED THAT I'M

21:13.005 --> 21:14.441
STEALING THIS CLIENT.

21:14.441 --> 21:15.408
YOU'RE WORRIED THAT HE'S

21:15.408 --> 21:16.609
STEALING ME.

21:16.609 --> 21:17.977
>> THE ONLY PERSON THAT SHOULD

21:17.977 --> 21:19.779
BE WORRIED IS YOU.

21:19.779 --> 21:21.848
>> OH, YEAH? WHY IS THAT?

21:21.848 --> 21:22.915
>> 'CAUSE YOUR REPUTATION IS

21:22.915 --> 21:24.050
GONNA PLUMMET WHEN PEOPLE FIND

21:24.050 --> 21:25.017
OUT YOU'RE SLEEPING WITH YOUR

21:25.017 --> 21:25.952
CLIENT.

21:25.952 --> 21:27.086
BUT THEN AGAIN, YOU MIGHT NOT

21:27.086 --> 21:29.756
CARE ABOUT YOUR REPUTATION.

21:39.566 --> 21:40.700
HE SURE DOES KNOW HOW TO CHARM A

21:40.700 --> 21:42.469
CROWD, DOESN'T HE?

21:42.469 --> 21:43.436
WE NEED TO GET HIM ON AMERICAN

21:43.436 --> 21:44.504
IDOL.

21:44.504 --> 21:45.538
THEY HAVE A REVOLVING DOOR OF

21:45.538 --> 21:47.574
JUDGES OVER THERE.

21:47.574 --> 21:48.741
>> ALL RIGHT, I'LL GET ON THAT.

21:48.741 --> 21:49.609
I GOTTA GO.

21:49.609 --> 21:51.411
>> OH, YOU WILL NOT.

21:51.411 --> 21:53.012
WHILE SERGIO IS CELEBRATING,

21:53.012 --> 21:54.280
YOU WILL CELEBRATE WITH HIM.

21:54.280 --> 21:55.281
>> YEAH, AND EVERYONE'S GONNA

21:55.281 --> 21:56.282
THINK THAT I GOT HIM TO SIGN

21:56.282 --> 21:57.384
BECAUSE I SLEPT WITH HIM.

21:57.384 --> 21:58.618
>> WHY DO YOU CARE WHAT PEOPLE

21:58.618 --> 21:59.652
THINK?

21:59.652 --> 22:00.753
WE'VE ALL BEEN ACCUSED OF

22:00.753 --> 22:02.822
SCREWING CLIENTS, DEAR.

22:02.822 --> 22:05.558
AND TRUST ME.

22:05.558 --> 22:07.660
I HAVE.

22:07.660 --> 22:08.895
BUT IT WASN'T TILL AFTER I'D

22:08.895 --> 22:10.062
GAINED THEIR RESPECT AND BUILT A

22:10.062 --> 22:11.130
RAPPORT.

22:11.130 --> 22:12.665
WE'RE WOMEN IN A MALE-DOMINATED

22:12.665 --> 22:14.434
INDUSTRY.

22:14.434 --> 22:15.535
IF THEY GET TO PLAY THE GOOD OLD

22:15.535 --> 22:17.003
BOYS CARD, THEN WE GET TO PLAY

22:17.003 --> 22:19.472
THE SEXY GIRLS CARD.

22:19.472 --> 22:20.607
PEOPLE NEVER WANT TO BELIEVE WE

22:20.607 --> 22:21.574
CAN ACHIEVE ANYTHING ON OUR OWN

22:21.574 --> 22:22.675
MERIT.

22:22.675 --> 22:23.776
THEY ALWAYS WANT TO BELIEVE IT'S

22:23.776 --> 22:25.412
BECAUSE OF OUR DADDIES OR OUR

22:25.412 --> 22:27.414
HUSBANDS OR OUR "GIRLS."

22:27.414 --> 22:28.448

22:28.448 --> 22:32.485

22:32.485 --> 22:33.686
BUT WITH NO MORE FREQUENCY THAN

22:33.686 --> 22:35.688
MEN.

22:35.688 --> 22:37.457
SO DON'T FOOL YOURSELF.

22:37.457 --> 22:38.658
AN ARTIST DOESN'T WANT TO SIGN

22:38.658 --> 22:39.959
WITH YOU JUST BECAUSE HE WANTS

22:39.959 --> 22:42.562
TO SLEEP WITH YOU.

22:42.562 --> 22:43.763
ARTISTS LIKE SERGIO CAN HAVE

22:43.763 --> 22:44.964
THEIR PICK AT WHOEVER THEY WANT,

22:44.964 --> 22:47.033
BUT HE SEES SOMETHING IN YOU,

APRIL.

22:49.436 --> 22:52.739
AND NOT JUST YOUR GIRLS.

22:52.739 --> 22:54.106
THE POINT IS, STOP SELLING

22:54.106 --> 22:56.075
YOURSELF SHORT.

22:56.075 --> 22:57.343
DON'T SMILE AT ME.

22:57.343 --> 22:59.546
SMILE AT SERGIO.

22:59.546 --> 23:01.514
YOUR JOB IS TO MAKE SURE HE

23:01.514 --> 23:03.450
NEVER FORGETS WHO BUTTERS HIS

23:03.450 --> 23:05.151
BREAD.

23:05.151 --> 23:06.453
>> AND THAT WOULD BE US?

23:06.453 --> 23:07.587
>> NO, PAULA DEEN.

23:07.587 --> 23:12.525
YES, US.

23:12.525 --> 23:15.728
THERE CAN BE SCREWING.

23:15.728 --> 23:19.599
BUT NO SCREWING UP.

23:19.599 --> 23:21.000
>> RIGHT.

23:21.000 --> 23:21.868
>> GO HANDLE THAT.

23:21.868 --> 23:25.805
>> OKAY.

APRIL, HEY.

23:32.879 --> 23:33.746
I THOUGHT YOU LEFT.

23:33.746 --> 23:34.747
DAVID SAID YOU WEREN'T FEELING

23:34.747 --> 23:35.615
WELL.

23:35.615 --> 23:36.483
>> OH, NO, NO.

23:36.483 --> 23:37.083
I SAID I WAS FEELING SWELL.

23:37.083 --> 23:37.950
>> SWELL?

23:37.950 --> 23:38.818
>> YES, DAVID.

23:38.818 --> 23:41.087
IT MEANS REALLY, REALLY GOOD.

23:41.087 --> 23:42.489
WOULD YOU LIKE TO MINGLE?

23:42.489 --> 23:46.493
>> YEAH.

24:27.033 --> 24:29.135
I'M NOT ONE OF YOUR JOHNS.

24:29.135 --> 24:30.603

NOTICE.

24:32.839 --> 24:35.074
STAY AWAY FROM MY MAN.

24:36.609 --> 24:37.844
>> IS THAT THE FOOD?

24:37.844 --> 24:41.848
WHEW, I'M STARVING.

24:43.850 --> 24:47.019
>> [scoffs]

24:53.560 --> 24:56.228
THANK YOU.

24:56.228 --> 24:59.198

24:59.198 --> 25:00.199
LOOK, I'M SORRY YOU HAD TO FIND

25:00.199 --> 25:01.200
OUT LIKE THIS.

25:01.200 --> 25:03.235
>> NO, NO, DON'T COME NEAR ME.

25:03.235 --> 25:04.170
>> THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH

25:04.170 --> 25:05.137
THE CASE.

25:05.137 --> 25:06.238
>> KEEP TELLING YOURSELF THAT.

25:06.238 --> 25:07.206
>> I DIDN'T THINK THE SIGHT OF

25:07.206 --> 25:08.107
ME WITH ANOTHER WOMAN WOULD

25:08.107 --> 25:09.576
ELICIT SUCH A REACTION FROM YOU.

25:09.576 --> 25:10.577
>> OH, BUT I DIDN'T SEE YOU WITH

25:10.577 --> 25:11.711
ANOTHER WOMAN.

25:11.711 --> 25:13.680
I SAW YOU WITH A PIECE OF TRASH.

25:13.680 --> 25:15.247
AND YOUR LAST PIECE OF TRASH

25:15.247 --> 25:18.017
DAMN NEAR KILLED ME.

>> IF FELICIA DIDN'T GIVE ME

25:37.604 --> 25:38.605
CREDIT FOR THE OUTFIT, IT'S

25:38.605 --> 25:39.606
BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T THINK IT WAS

25:39.606 --> 25:40.873
GOOD ENOUGH.

25:40.873 --> 25:42.208
THE NEXT ONE HAS TO BE BETTER.

25:42.208 --> 25:43.209
>> YOU'RE GETTING LOST IN THIS

WITH YOU AND FELICIA.

25:46.613 --> 25:48.114
IT'S NOT WHAT I SIGNED UP FOR.

ME.

25:52.518 --> 25:53.686
AND I LOVE WHAT I DO.

25:53.686 --> 25:54.921

25:54.921 --> 25:59.191
JOB.

25:59.191 --> 26:03.295
BUT WHAT ABOUT ME?

26:03.295 --> 26:06.232
>> I LOVE BEING WITH YOU.

26:06.232 --> 26:07.199
THIS IS SOMETHING I'VE WAITED

26:07.199 --> 26:08.868
FOR MY ENTIRE LIFE.

26:08.868 --> 26:10.502

26:10.502 --> 26:14.707
DON'T LET ME STAND IN YOUR WAY.

26:14.707 --> 26:16.643

26:22.514 --> 26:23.683
WERE, LIKE, TEN YEARS YOUNGER.

26:23.683 --> 26:24.651
BUT I CAN'T SIGN YOU NOW.

26:24.651 --> 26:26.052
>> HEY. HAVE YOU SEEN SERGIO?

26:26.052 --> 26:26.953
I LOST HIM FOR A WHILE IN THE

26:26.953 --> 26:27.954
CROWD.

26:27.954 --> 26:29.889
>> HE'S ACTUALLY RIGHT THERE.

26:29.889 --> 26:31.658
WITH LUGGAGE.

26:31.658 --> 26:34.560
>> WHAT?

26:34.560 --> 26:36.562
HEY.

26:36.562 --> 26:38.164
[chuckles]

26:38.164 --> 26:39.932
THIS IS A SURPRISE.

26:39.932 --> 26:41.033
NEVER HAD SOMEONE SNEAK OUT ON

26:41.033 --> 26:42.802
ME IN THE MIDDLE OF A DATE.

UH...

26:48.074 --> 26:49.308
>> WAIT, DID DAVID NOT TELL YOU?

26:49.308 --> 26:50.276
>> NO.

26:50.276 --> 26:51.711
>> HE FOUND OUT ENRIQUE IGLESIAS

26:51.711 --> 26:52.679
NEEDED SOMEONE FOR THE ASIAN

26:52.679 --> 26:53.279
LEG.

26:53.279 --> 26:54.914
IT WAS KIND OF AN EMERGENCY.

26:54.914 --> 26:56.849
>> AND YOU'RE THE CO-HEADLINER.

27:02.354 --> 27:05.692
CAN TRY AGAIN.

27:05.692 --> 27:06.893
BUT I'M SO GLAD WE'RE WORKING

27:33.820 --> 27:34.921
BECAUSE YOU'RE JEALOUS.

27:34.921 --> 27:35.855
>> JEALOUS OF WHAT?

27:35.855 --> 27:37.056
THE FACT THAT YOU WAS AFTER HIM

27:37.056 --> 27:38.590
LIKE A RATCHET GIRLS GONE WILD?

27:38.590 --> 27:39.358

28:34.847 --> 28:35.915
AND THERE IS...

28:35.915 --> 28:38.885
[chuckles]

28:38.885 --> 28:40.086
THERE IS A LOT THAT I NEED TO

28:40.086 --> 28:42.789
COME CLEAN WITH YOU ABOUT.

28:42.789 --> 28:43.956
>> YEAH, WELL, YOU SHOULD'VE

28:43.956 --> 28:45.157
DONE THAT A LONG TIME AGO.

28:45.157 --> 28:46.826
>> AND NO ONE REALIZES THAT MORE

28:46.826 --> 28:47.794
THAN I DO, KEISHA, YOU

28:47.794 --> 28:48.895
UNDERSTAND THAT?

28:48.895 --> 28:50.462
NO ONE.

28:50.462 --> 28:51.463
BUT IN MY DEFENSE, I DIDN'T WANT

28:51.463 --> 28:52.899
TO IMPLICATE YOU IN THIS.

28:52.899 --> 28:53.900
I DIDN'T WANT TO IMPLICATE YOU

28:53.900 --> 28:55.234
IN ANY OF THIS.

28:55.234 --> 28:56.102
NOW, THAT YOU HAVE TO

28:56.102 --> 28:57.269
UNDERSTAND.

28:57.269 --> 28:59.872
>> I FACED DOWN THE FBI FOR YOU.

28:59.872 --> 29:02.308
THEY SICKED THE IRS ON ME AND I

29:02.308 --> 29:04.443
STILL DIDN'T TALK.

29:04.443 --> 29:06.545
I DESERVE YOUR HONESTY.

29:06.545 --> 29:10.082
>> YES, YOU DO.

29:10.082 --> 29:12.151
FRANK'S JEWELS HAS HAD SOME NOT

29:12.151 --> 29:13.285
COMPLETELY LEGAL BUSINESS

29:13.285 --> 29:15.922
DEALINGS.

29:15.922 --> 29:19.892
ESPECIALLY WITH DEACON.

29:19.892 --> 29:22.829
>> DEACON?

29:22.829 --> 29:24.063
OH, MY G--

29:24.063 --> 29:25.832
YOU HAVE GONE AND COMPLETELY

29:25.832 --> 29:28.334
LOST YOUR MIND.

29:28.334 --> 29:29.836
WHO ARE YOU?

29:29.836 --> 29:30.870
>> OH, KEISHA, YOU KNOW EXACTLY

29:30.870 --> 29:32.004
WHO I AM.

29:32.004 --> 29:33.239
I'M THE SAME MAN THAT'S BEEN

29:33.239 --> 29:34.406
THERE FOR YOU, I'M THE SAME MAN

29:34.406 --> 29:36.042
WHO LOVES YOU TODAY.

29:36.042 --> 29:37.276
>> LOVES ME?

29:37.276 --> 29:39.411
YOU LIED TO ME.

29:39.411 --> 29:40.847
YOU HAVE KEPT THINGS FROM ME

29:40.847 --> 29:43.315
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

29:43.315 --> 29:44.550
HOW DO YOU THINK I FELT WHEN I

29:44.550 --> 29:46.218
FOUND OUT ON MY OWN THAT YOU

29:46.218 --> 29:47.219
WERE MARRIED BEFORE?

29:47.219 --> 29:48.254
AND YOU WERE STILL SUPPORTING

29:48.254 --> 29:49.121
HER.

29:49.121 --> 29:50.522
AND NOW I FIND YOU WITH NAOMI?

29:50.522 --> 29:52.458
>> HEY. NEVER, ALL RIGHT?

29:52.458 --> 29:54.861
NEVER WOULD I CHEAT ON YOU.

29:54.861 --> 29:56.462
FINE, DEACON AND I, YEAH, WE

29:56.462 --> 29:58.264
USED NAOMI, BUT WE USED NAOMI AS

29:58.264 --> 29:59.966
A GO-BETWEEN FOR OUR BUSINESS

29:59.966 --> 30:02.134
DEALINGS, SIMPLY TO GIVE US

30:02.134 --> 30:03.569
DENIABILITY.

30:03.569 --> 30:06.138
>> IS THAT ALL YOU USED HER FOR?

30:06.138 --> 30:07.239
'CAUSE IT SURE DIDN'T LOOK LIKE

30:07.239 --> 30:11.110
IT.

30:11.110 --> 30:12.478
ANSWER ME.

30:12.478 --> 30:14.146
>> IT DIDN'T LAST LONG, AND IT

30:14.146 --> 30:16.015
WAS OVER THREE YEARS AGO.

30:16.015 --> 30:17.383
WAY BEFORE YOU AND I EVEN MET,

30:17.383 --> 30:19.285
WAY BEFORE YOU AND I EVEN KNEW

30:19.285 --> 30:21.453
EACH OTHER EXISTED.

30:21.453 --> 30:23.956
>> BUT YOU LIED TO ME.

30:23.956 --> 30:28.127
I OPENED MY HEART TO YOU.

30:28.127 --> 30:31.130
I TRUSTED YOU.

30:31.130 --> 30:32.431
I TOLD YOU THINGS ABOUT ME I

30:32.431 --> 30:34.967
NEVER TOLD ANYONE.

30:34.967 --> 30:37.136
AND THIS IS HOW YOU REPAY ME?

30:37.136 --> 30:38.504
>> IT WASN'T LIKE THAT.

30:38.504 --> 30:39.438
AND YOU KNOW IT WASN'T LIKE

30:39.438 --> 30:40.306
THAT.

30:40.306 --> 30:43.542
>> BUT IT IS.

30:43.542 --> 30:45.978
ONE ENDLESS PARADE OF SHADE WITH

30:45.978 --> 30:47.313
YOU.

30:47.313 --> 30:50.216
>> SHADE?

30:50.216 --> 30:53.319
SHADE?

30:53.319 --> 30:55.087
EVERY SINGLE THING THAT I HAVE

30:55.087 --> 30:57.356
DONE HAS BEEN TO HELP MY FAMILY.

30:57.356 --> 30:59.992
THAT MAKES ME SHADY?

30:59.992 --> 31:02.494
>> SEAN AND WINSTON, THEY WARNED

31:02.494 --> 31:03.562
ME ABOUT YOU.

31:03.562 --> 31:04.430
>> OH, COME ON.

31:04.430 --> 31:06.032
>> THEY WERE RIGHT ALL ALONG.

31:06.032 --> 31:09.101
BUT I DEFENDED YOU.

31:09.101 --> 31:11.470
ALL THIS TIME I BELIEVED IN YOU.

31:11.470 --> 31:12.338
>> OKAY, LISTEN--

31:12.338 --> 31:13.205
>> NO.

31:13.205 --> 31:17.443
DON'T YOU DARE COME NEAR ME.

31:23.349 --> 31:24.683
>> * OH, OH, OH, OH

31:24.683 --> 31:27.686
* OH, OH, OH, OH

31:27.686 --> 31:29.421
* OH, OH, OH, OH

31:29.421 --> 31:31.690
>> I HAVE TO TELL YOU I...

31:31.690 --> 31:33.592
I REALLY ENJOY YOUR COMPANY.

31:33.592 --> 31:35.161
>> THANK YOU.

31:35.161 --> 31:36.162
BEEN A MINUTE SINCE I MET

31:36.162 --> 31:37.263
SOMEONE I REALLY WANTED TO GET

31:37.263 --> 31:38.464
TO KNOW.

31:38.464 --> 31:39.298
>> YOU KNOW, WOMEN LIKE YOU

31:39.298 --> 31:41.767
DON'T COME AROUND EVERY DAY.

31:41.767 --> 31:42.768
>> THAT'S VERY SWEET OF YOU TO

31:42.768 --> 31:44.036
SAY.

31:44.036 --> 31:45.104
>> LOOK, I HOPE I'M NOT

31:45.104 --> 31:46.672
OVERSTEPPING MY BOUNDS, BUT--

31:46.672 --> 31:47.773
>> DON'T WORRY.

31:47.773 --> 31:49.608
IF EVER, YOU WILL BE HANDLED

31:49.608 --> 31:52.211
ACCORDINGLY. [chuckles]

31:52.211 --> 31:54.713
>> I'D EXPECT NOTHING LESS.

31:54.713 --> 31:58.784
RAQUEL, I, UM...

31:58.784 --> 32:02.188
I WANT YOU TO BE MY MISTRESS.

32:02.188 --> 32:03.155
>> YOU'RE MARRIED?

32:03.155 --> 32:05.424
>> WHAT? NO. I'M NOT MARRIED.

32:05.424 --> 32:06.725
LOOK, I WOULD NEVER LIE TO YOU,

32:06.725 --> 32:07.593
RAQUEL.

32:07.593 --> 32:09.361
EVER.

32:09.361 --> 32:10.696
I'M A SUB.

32:10.696 --> 32:11.763
>> YOU'RE A WHAT?

32:11.763 --> 32:13.499
>> I'M A SUBMISSIVE.

32:13.499 --> 32:14.833
I WANT YOU TO BE MY DOM, MY

32:14.833 --> 32:18.804
MISTRESS, MY DOMINATRIX.

32:18.804 --> 32:21.807
>> OH.

OH.

32:24.310 --> 32:27.779
NO. NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

32:27.779 --> 32:28.747
I MEAN, WHAT WOULD MAKE YOU

32:28.747 --> 32:29.715
THINK THAT I WOULD EVEN WANT--

32:29.715 --> 32:31.617
>> YOU DROPPED A MILLION HINTS.

32:31.617 --> 32:33.119
"I LIKE TO BE ON TOP."

32:33.119 --> 32:34.420
"I'M GONNA HAVE TO TRAIN YOU."

32:34.420 --> 32:35.287
"YOU'LL BE PUNISHED."

32:35.287 --> 32:36.155
>> GRANT, THOSE WERE

32:36.155 --> 32:36.822
EXPRESSIONS.

32:36.822 --> 32:38.557
>> OF WANTING TO DOMINATE.

32:38.557 --> 32:39.658
IT'S IN YOUR BLOOD, YOU'RE A

32:39.658 --> 32:41.327
NATURAL, I KNOW IT.

32:41.327 --> 32:44.163
LOOK, I WANT TO BE YOUR SLAVE.

32:44.163 --> 32:46.532
I WANT YOU TO MAKE ME DO THINGS

32:46.532 --> 32:47.399
FOR YOU.

32:47.399 --> 32:48.667
>> SHH.

32:48.667 --> 32:50.136
IF I WANTED AN ASSISTANT, I

32:50.136 --> 32:51.637
WOULD HIRE ONE.

32:51.637 --> 32:52.538
>> NOT FOR THE THINGS THAT I

32:52.538 --> 32:55.641
WILL DO.

32:55.641 --> 32:57.609
>> LOOK, GRANT, YOU'RE A REALLY

32:57.609 --> 32:59.645
NICE GUY, AND I DON'T WANT TO BE

32:59.645 --> 33:00.512
RUDE, BUT--

33:00.512 --> 33:02.448
>> BUT YOU CAN, CAN'T YOU SEE?

33:02.448 --> 33:05.351
HUMILIATION TURNS ME ON.

33:05.351 --> 33:06.618
I LOVE IT.

33:06.618 --> 33:08.220
>> UH, RAQUEL?

33:08.220 --> 33:08.920
[chuckles] I THOUGHT THAT WAS

33:08.920 --> 33:09.788
YOU.

33:09.788 --> 33:10.656
EXCUSE ME.

33:10.656 --> 33:12.324
>> MR. JARED, HI.

IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU.

33:13.659 --> 33:15.161

33:16.595 --> 33:17.763
DEACON.

33:17.763 --> 33:19.398
>> OKAY. DEACON IT IS.

33:19.398 --> 33:21.200
DEACON, THIS IS MY FRIEND GRANT.

33:21.200 --> 33:21.867

IT'S EXCELLENT.

33:27.906 --> 33:28.907
>> WILL DO.

33:28.907 --> 33:31.577
ACTUALLY, GRANT, YOU WERE JUST

33:31.577 --> 33:33.212
SAYING THAT YOU'RE FEELING SICK,

33:33.212 --> 33:34.480
RIGHT?

33:34.480 --> 33:36.282
AND THAT YOU HAD TO GO.

33:36.282 --> 33:36.948
>> I WAS?

33:36.948 --> 33:37.816
>> YUP. MM-HMM.

33:37.816 --> 33:38.684
>> I AM.

33:38.684 --> 33:41.153

33:41.820 --> 33:42.688
AGAIN.

33:42.688 --> 33:45.224
>> PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.

33:45.224 --> 33:46.725
>> GOOD-BYE, RAQUEL.

33:46.725 --> 33:48.894
>> FEEL BETTER.

33:48.894 --> 33:50.162
>> I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T MEAN TO

33:50.162 --> 33:50.829
DISTURB YOU.

33:50.829 --> 33:52.164

WHAT A LUCKY COINCIDENCE.

33:57.303 --> 33:59.171
YOU KNOW, I WAS JUST ABOUT TO

33:59.171 --> 34:01.307
DINE BY MYSELF.

34:01.307 --> 34:02.841

YOU'RE A STAR.

34:52.491 --> 34:54.926
>> OH, MY GOD, FELICIA.

36:12.371 --> 36:13.405
>> WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

36:13.405 --> 36:15.974
WHERE ARE WE?

36:15.974 --> 36:19.378
>> THIS IS WHERE I KEEP MY MOST

36:19.378 --> 36:23.982
PRECIOUS POSSESSIONS.

36:23.982 --> 36:28.554
AND HERE IS WHERE I KEEP THE

36:28.554 --> 36:33.392
MOST PRECIOUS OF THE PRECIOUS.

36:35.394 --> 36:36.428
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO TURN

36:36.428 --> 36:37.095
AROUND, THOUGH.

36:37.095 --> 36:37.963
>> [chuckles] COME ON.

36:37.963 --> 36:38.830
>> NO, NO.

36:38.830 --> 36:39.665
NO ONE KNOWS THIS COMBINATION

36:39.665 --> 36:41.500
EXCEPT FOR ME.

36:41.500 --> 36:42.368
I'M SERIOUS.

36:42.368 --> 36:44.636
>> OKAY.

36:52.811 --> 36:54.880
>> TURN AROUND.

36:54.880 --> 36:56.382

37:01.953 --> 37:03.121
>> THE JOSEPHINE BAKER?

37:03.121 --> 37:04.490
>> THE ONE AND ONLY.

37:04.490 --> 37:05.724
SHE WAS PHOTOGRAPHED MANY TIMES

37:05.724 --> 37:06.992
WITH THAT.

37:06.992 --> 37:09.395
PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WAS FAKE, BUT

37:09.395 --> 37:10.929
THEY WERE WRONG.

37:10.929 --> 37:13.499
>> WOW. IT'S GORGEOUS.

37:13.499 --> 37:15.066
>> WOULD YOU LIKE TO TRY IT ON?

37:15.066 --> 37:18.737
>> ABSOLUTELY.

37:24.776 --> 37:25.877
>> IS THAT TOO TIGHT?

37:25.877 --> 37:28.146
>> NO, NO, IT'S PERFECT.

37:28.146 --> 37:30.782
>> LET'S SEE.

37:30.782 --> 37:33.519
MM, STUNNING.

37:33.519 --> 37:36.855
HOW 'BOUT I TAKE A PICTURE?

37:38.524 --> 37:42.193
PERFECT.

37:42.193 --> 37:45.030
STUNNING, STUNNING, STUNNING.

38:00.011 --> 38:01.947
>> [sighs]

38:01.947 --> 38:03.014
KEISHA, WE HAVE TO TALK THIS

38:03.014 --> 38:04.650
THROUGH.

38:04.650 --> 38:07.252
I KNOW WE CAN.

38:07.252 --> 38:08.219
>> I DON'T THINK YOU KNOW

38:08.219 --> 38:10.856
ANYTHING.

38:10.856 --> 38:11.923
THERE USED TO BE A TIME WHEN I

38:11.923 --> 38:12.891
THOUGHT YOU WERE THE SMARTEST

38:12.891 --> 38:16.695
MAN I EVER MET.

38:16.695 --> 38:19.665
I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW WRONG I WAS.

38:22.668 --> 38:25.571
[phone chimes]

38:27.172 --> 38:29.708
WHO WAS THAT?

38:29.708 --> 38:31.610
>> OH, GOD.

38:31.610 --> 38:33.645
>> WHAT?

38:33.645 --> 38:36.114
[phone vibrates]

38:36.114 --> 38:38.850
>> DEACON.

38:38.850 --> 38:40.185
"I GET A THIRD AND YOU GET HER

38:40.185 --> 38:43.689
BACK."

38:43.689 --> 38:46.758
[grunts]

38:53.164 --> 38:54.165
CALL A CAB, AND THEN I'M GONNA

38:54.165 --> 38:56.935
HEAD HOME.

38:56.935 --> 38:57.936
>> THIS NEW ACT I'VE BEEN

38:57.936 --> 38:59.405
TRACKING'S PLAYING UP THE BLOCK.

38:59.405 --> 39:00.305
HEY, WHY DON'T YOU JUST COME

39:00.305 --> 39:01.172

39:01.172 --> 39:02.107
>> ARE YOU TRYING TO ASK ME OUT

39:02.107 --> 39:03.041
ON A DATE?

39:03.041 --> 39:04.009
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF

39:04.009 --> 39:05.243
DEAL THAT YOU HAVE WITH TERRENCE

39:05.243 --> 39:06.177

39:07.212 --> 39:08.213
BARGAIN.

39:08.213 --> 39:09.448
AND YOU, MY DEAR, ARE THE

39:09.448 --> 39:11.182
PERFECT BARGAINING CHIP.

39:11.182 --> 39:12.718
>> I HAVE AN IDEA OF WHERE HE

39:12.718 --> 39:13.752
MIGHT BE HOLDING HER.

39:13.752 --> 39:14.420
>> GOOD.

39:14.420 --> 39:15.787
WE NEED AN ADDRESS, AND WE NEED

39:15.787 --> 39:16.855
YOU TO DISTRACT HIM WHILE WE GO

39:16.855 --> 39:17.756
AND LOOK FOR HER.

39:17.756 --> 39:19.224
>> SO DAVID, WHO IS YOUR

39:19.224 --> 39:20.426
GORGEOUS DATE?

39:20.426 --> 39:21.993
AND WHY IS SHE WITH YOU AND NOT

39:21.993 --> 39:22.928

39:22.928 --> 39:24.095
>> THIS THING WITH NAOMI--

39:24.095 --> 39:25.897
>> HEY, IF YOU WANT TO GET WITH

39:25.897 --> 39:27.332
THAT PIECE OF TRASH, THAT'S YOUR

39:27.332 --> 39:28.434
BUSINESS.

39:28.434 --> 39:29.435
BUT JUST KNOW YOU'RE GETTING

39:29.435 --> 39:31.937
MALCOLM SR. AND JR.'S SLOPPY

39:31.937 --> 39:33.439
SECONDS.

39:33.439 --> 39:34.440
>> THEY SENT AN EIGHT!

39:34.440 --> 39:35.941
FELICIA IS A TWO.

39:35.941 --> 39:37.876
>> CAN'T IT BE HANDLED TOMORROW?

39:37.876 --> 39:39.445
>> THEN THE BODY PART IN THIS

39:39.445 --> 39:40.879
BOX WOULD BE MY HEAD.

39:40.879 --> 39:42.013
>> YOU REALIZE YOU SCREW THIS UP

39:42.013 --> 39:42.948
WE COULD ALL END UP IN A

39:42.948 --> 39:44.149
LANDFILL.

39:44.149 --> 39:45.451
>> WHAT DO YOU SAY WE GET IN AND
