00:53.100 --> 00:58.400
<i>Once upon a time, in
a magical kingdom known as Andalasia,</i>

00:58.500 --> 01:01.300
<i>there lived an evil queen.</i>

01:01.300 --> 01:02.900
<i>Selfish and cruel,</i>

01:03.000 --> 01:07.500
<i>she lived in fear that one day
her stepson would marry,</i>

01:07.600 --> 01:10.500
<i>and she would
lose her throne forever.</i>

01:10.600 --> 01:16.100
<i>And so, she did all in her power
to prevent the prince from ever meeting</i>

01:16.200 --> 01:22.200
<i>the one special maiden with whom
he would share true love's kiss.</i>

01:22.200 --> 01:25.500
Giselle, Giselle,
how about this for your statue?

01:25.500 --> 01:28.700
- Oh, this will be perfect. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:28.800 --> 01:32.600
Come on! OK, you mookses, move it!
We have got a face to put together here

01:32.600 --> 01:35.200
while it's still ingrained
in her subcranium.

01:35.200 --> 01:37.700
Oh, Pip, it was
such a lovely dream.

01:37.800 --> 01:40.800
We were holding hands
and dancing, and...

01:40.900 --> 01:42.400
- Oh!
- And these for the eyes.

01:42.400 --> 01:44.800
Blue? Oh, how did you know?

01:44.900 --> 01:47.800
And they sparkle just like his. Mm!

01:47.800 --> 01:51.100
OK. There we go.

01:51.200 --> 01:55.000
- Yes! That's it!
- OK. Yeah, yeah.

01:55.100 --> 02:00.200
- Floor's yours, honey.
- Presenting my one true love.

02:00.300 --> 02:03.200
My prince. My dream come true.

02:03.300 --> 02:06.600
Oh, my goodness!

02:06.700 --> 02:11.200
- Whoa, whoa. What? What's the problem?
- I didn't give him any lips.

02:11.300 --> 02:13.900
- Ooh!
- Does he have to have lips?

02:14.000 --> 02:15.900
Of course.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.600
When you meet the someone
who is meant for you

02:19.700 --> 02:24.500
<i># Before two can become one
There's something you must do</i>

02:24.500 --> 02:28.400
- Do you pull each other's tails?
- Do you feed each other seeds?

02:28.500 --> 02:30.000
No.

02:30.100 --> 02:32.400
<i># There is something sweeter</i>

02:32.500 --> 02:37.300
<i># Everybody needs</i>

02:37.300 --> 02:41.900
<i># I've been dreaming
of a true love's kiss</i>

02:42.000 --> 02:45.800
<i># And a prince
I'm hoping comes with this</i>

02:45.800 --> 02:47.800
<i># That's what brings</i>

02:47.900 --> 02:52.000
<i># Ever-afterings so happy</i>

02:53.700 --> 02:57.700
<i># And that's the reason
we need lips so much</i>

02:57.800 --> 03:01.700
<i># For lips are the
only things that touch</i>

03:01.700 --> 03:03.200
<i># So to spend</i>

03:03.200 --> 03:07.500
<i># A life of endless bliss</i>

03:07.500 --> 03:10.200
<i># Just find who you love</i>

03:10.300 --> 03:15.600
<i># Through true love's kiss #</i>

03:18.000 --> 03:21.400
If we're going to find
a perfect pair of lips,

03:21.500 --> 03:23.900
we're going to need
a lot more help.

03:32.400 --> 03:36.200
<i># She's been dreaming
of a true love's kiss</i>

03:36.300 --> 03:40.100
<i># And a prince she's hoping
comes with this</i>

03:40.200 --> 03:43.600
<i># That's what brings
ever-afterings</i>

03:43.600 --> 03:47.800
<i>- # So happy
- # So happy</i>

03:47.900 --> 03:51.400
<i># That's the reason
we need lips so much</i>

03:51.500 --> 03:55.500
<i># For lips are the
only things that touch</i>

03:55.600 --> 03:57.600
Humph!

03:57.700 --> 04:01.700
<i># So to spend a life</i>

04:01.800 --> 04:05.100
<i># Of endless bliss</i>

04:05.100 --> 04:08.700
<i># Just find who you love</i>

04:08.700 --> 04:14.600
<i># Through true love's kiss #</i>

04:14.600 --> 04:15.500
Look out below!

04:15.500 --> 04:17.200
Look out below!

04:19.200 --> 04:22.700
Amazing, sire.

04:22.700 --> 04:26.200
Your tenth troll this month.

04:26.300 --> 04:29.400
Oh, I love hunting trolls.

04:29.500 --> 04:33.300
Big trolls, little trolls.
Trolls, trolls, trolls...

04:33.300 --> 04:36.100
- Sorry.
- Oh, that's OK.

04:36.200 --> 04:38.900
Ah, trolls are fine
to pass the time, Nathaniel,

04:38.900 --> 04:43.000
but... but my heart longs
to be joined in song.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.800
<i># I've been dreaming
of a true love's kiss</i>

04:46.900 --> 04:49.200
<i>- # And a...
- #... prince I'm hoping</i>

04:49.300 --> 04:53.100
<i>- # Comes with this
- Do you hear that, Nathaniel?</i>

04:53.200 --> 04:54.900
Me? No.
No, I hear nothing.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.100
Nothing.

04:57.200 --> 04:59.600
- Oh!
- I must find the maiden

04:59.700 --> 05:03.400
- that belongs to that sweet voice.
- Oh, no! Come back, sire.

05:03.500 --> 05:05.900
- No, you're hallucinating!
- Ride, Destiny!

05:06.000 --> 05:08.400
Oh!

05:08.500 --> 05:12.900
Oh, pooh. Oh, no.
No. This isn't good.

05:12.900 --> 05:16.800
All these years of troll chasing, trying
to keep him from ever meeting a girl.

05:16.900 --> 05:20.700
Oh, the queen.
No, she's not going to like this.

05:20.800 --> 05:25.600
<i># True love's kiss #</i>

05:31.100 --> 05:34.600
<i># True love's kiss #</i>

05:35.900 --> 05:39.700
<i># True love's kiss #</i>

05:39.800 --> 05:43.400
Oh, you shall not prevail, foul troll.
That maiden is mine!

05:44.500 --> 05:48.800
Honey, do you really think
your dream boy exists?

05:48.800 --> 05:52.600
Oh, Pip. I know he's
out there somewhere.

05:52.600 --> 05:54.800
Eye! Eye! Eye-Eye.

05:54.900 --> 05:58.600
- I... I what?
- I eat you now.

05:58.700 --> 06:01.300
Everybody, scatter!

06:01.400 --> 06:04.800
Gotcha. Huh?

06:05.800 --> 06:08.200
Hey! That's cheating!

06:09.400 --> 06:12.300
I supposed to eat you.

06:12.400 --> 06:14.200
Oh, no you don't,
you big lug.

06:14.200 --> 06:16.500
Oh? Oh!

06:16.500 --> 06:20.000
Ah!

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
Wow, I got to lay off the nuts.

06:23.100 --> 06:25.900
Girl yummy.

06:27.200 --> 06:30.000
Fear not, fair maiden.
I am here.

06:30.100 --> 06:34.600
- Whoa!
- Gotcha!

06:34.600 --> 06:37.700
Whoa!

06:38.700 --> 06:41.500
Uh-oh. Whoo!

06:41.600 --> 06:45.000
Oh! Pip!

06:45.100 --> 06:46.900
Just hang on, honey.
I'm going to...

06:47.000 --> 06:50.100
Ow! Ow! Ow!

06:51.400 --> 06:53.100
Oh, my gosh.

06:53.200 --> 06:57.300
- It's you.
- Yes, it's me.

06:57.300 --> 07:00.000
- And you are?
- Giselle.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.900
Oh! Giselle! We shall be
married in the morning.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.900
<i># You're the fairest maid
I've ever met</i>

07:08.900 --> 07:12.600
<i>- # You were made...
- # To finish your duet</i>

07:12.700 --> 07:17.800
<i># And in years
to come we'll reminisce</i>

07:17.900 --> 07:22.200
<i># How we came to love</i>

07:22.300 --> 07:25.800
<i># And grew and grew love</i>

07:25.900 --> 07:29.400
<i># Since first we knew love</i>

07:29.400 --> 07:35.400
<i># Through true love's kiss #</i>

07:47.800 --> 07:51.100
Oh, so this is the little forest rat

07:51.200 --> 07:54.500
who thinks she
can steal my throne.

07:54.500 --> 07:57.000
Never!

08:11.800 --> 08:15.400
Oh! Excuse me.
I am so sorry.

08:15.400 --> 08:17.500
- Oh! Am I late?
- No, miss.

08:17.600 --> 08:20.000
- I do hope I'm not late.
- Just in time.

08:20.100 --> 08:22.600
- Oh, thank goodness.
- Hey, honey, wait up!

08:22.600 --> 08:26.800
- We ain't done with you yet.
- No! Ah!

08:27.700 --> 08:29.000
Oy!

08:37.500 --> 08:40.100
- Oh! Thank you.
- You're welcome, Giselle.

08:40.200 --> 08:44.600
You're getting married!

08:44.700 --> 08:47.600
Oh, and what do we look like, garbage?

08:47.600 --> 08:50.400
- Close the door on me!
- If you'll allow me...

08:50.500 --> 08:53.400
To think that in a few moments
that Edward and I...

08:53.500 --> 08:56.200
- Yes, yes.
- That he and me... That we...

08:56.300 --> 08:59.000
Oh, my.

08:59.100 --> 09:02.100
Oh, what a lovely bride.

09:02.200 --> 09:03.500
That's very kind of you,

09:03.600 --> 09:04.900
- but I really...
- No, no!

09:04.900 --> 09:08.700
- Granny has a wedding gift for you.
- Thank you.

09:08.700 --> 09:12.200
But I really should be going.
You see, I'm going...

09:12.300 --> 09:15.200
- 'Tis a wishing well, dear.
- Oh!

09:15.200 --> 09:17.700
But all my wishes
are about to come true.

09:17.800 --> 09:21.100
If I ever see that fat mook's
face again, I'm gonna...

09:21.200 --> 09:22.900
I really do have to go.

09:22.900 --> 09:25.100
But a wish on your wedding day.

09:25.200 --> 09:30.100
That's the most magical of all.

09:30.200 --> 09:35.100
Just close your eyes,
my darling, and make your wish.

09:35.100 --> 09:38.100
That's right. That's right.
Lean in close.

09:38.200 --> 09:43.000
- Are you wishing for something?
- Yes, I am.

09:43.100 --> 09:46.900
And they both lived happily
ever aft...

09:49.100 --> 09:52.700
Help! Edward!
Prince Edward, we need help!

09:52.800 --> 09:57.200
Speciosus, formosus, praeclarus!

09:57.300 --> 10:01.500
Where, my most adored queen,
where did you send her?

10:01.600 --> 10:06.700
To a place where there
are no "happily ever afters."

10:15.600 --> 10:18.000
Oh! Oh.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.100
Oh!

10:22.100 --> 10:24.800
What is this?

10:24.800 --> 10:28.400
Oh!

12:08.500 --> 12:10.600
Oh!

12:10.700 --> 12:13.200
Oh!

12:17.900 --> 12:19.500
Oh!

12:24.300 --> 12:25.900
Oh!

12:26.000 --> 12:28.200
Oh!

12:30.700 --> 12:33.400
- Get out of the street!
- Oh!

12:33.400 --> 12:35.700
- Oh!
- Whoa!

12:35.700 --> 12:39.900
Lady! Are you crazy? Now you
have to pay for all of this.

12:39.900 --> 12:43.100
I'm sorry. Excuse me.
I was wondering if one of you

12:43.200 --> 12:46.900
kind people might
direct me to the castle?

12:48.300 --> 12:50.500
Oh!

12:50.600 --> 12:53.500
Hey, watch it, will you?

12:53.600 --> 12:58.500
- Grumpy!
- Jeez, lady. Are you for real?

12:58.600 --> 13:01.800
I think so. Oh, wait! Wait!

13:01.800 --> 13:04.400
Where are you going? Please, if you
could just point me to the castle?

13:04.400 --> 13:05.800
Where are you going? Please, if you
could just point me to the castle?

13:05.800 --> 13:10.400
I'm supposed to be at the ball
to wed my true love,

13:10.400 --> 13:14.000
Prince Ed... Oh! Edward!

13:14.100 --> 13:16.000
Edward?

13:17.300 --> 13:20.700
Oh! Edward!

13:38.400 --> 13:40.700
Edward?

13:40.800 --> 13:43.000
Oh, no.

13:47.500 --> 13:52.300
Oh! Hello, old man! Oh!

13:52.400 --> 13:54.100
Hello.

13:54.100 --> 13:56.400
May I sit with you?

13:56.500 --> 13:58.100
Oh!

13:58.200 --> 14:01.500
I'm very tired, and I'm scared.

14:01.500 --> 14:04.000
I've never been this far away
from home before,

14:04.100 --> 14:06.700
and I'm not sure at all where I am.

14:06.800 --> 14:09.600
If somebody could show me
just a bit of kindness,

14:09.600 --> 14:12.700
a friendly "hello" or even a smile,

14:12.800 --> 14:15.500
I'm sure that would
lift my spirits so much.

14:18.500 --> 14:22.000
Oh. You have a lovely smile.

14:22.100 --> 14:25.300
Oh! Where are you going?

14:25.400 --> 14:30.500
That's mine!
Bring that back here!

14:30.600 --> 14:35.100
You! Come back here!
I need that!

14:35.200 --> 14:36.700
Oh! Please?

14:37.400 --> 14:38.900
You...

14:39.000 --> 14:41.700
...are not a very nice old man!

14:53.500 --> 14:55.700
No way you're getting him,
Ethan.

14:55.800 --> 14:59.100
- You want him because I want him.
- I'm not letting you have him!

14:59.200 --> 15:02.000
- Forget it. Hank is coming with me.
- Wait a minute, guys.

15:02.100 --> 15:04.700
- I'm getting confused. Who is Hank?
- Hank Aaron.

15:04.800 --> 15:08.300
Milwaukee Braves?
His 1954 rookie card.

15:08.400 --> 15:10.100
A baseball card?

15:11.200 --> 15:13.500
That's what this gets down to
is a baseball card?

15:13.600 --> 15:15.100
You never loved Hank like me.

15:15.200 --> 15:18.000
- You never loved me like Hank!
- How did I make you so angry?

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
- Robert?
- Yes?

15:19.100 --> 15:21.300
- It's time.
- Ask what you didn't do.

15:21.400 --> 15:24.000
- It's a longer list!
- What would you do if you...?

15:24.000 --> 15:26.900
I have to pick up my daughter.
Can we do this around 9:00?

15:27.000 --> 15:29.600
- 9:00 sounds good.
- Great. I'll see you then.

15:29.700 --> 15:31.600
Phoebe, I'll see you in the morning, OK?

15:31.700 --> 15:33.700
You're just afraid
I don't need you!

15:33.700 --> 15:35.500
- I need a vacation!
- Thank you.

15:35.600 --> 15:38.400
After a whole day of that,
you still want to get engaged?

15:38.500 --> 15:41.000
Those people got married
on a crazy romantic whim.

15:41.100 --> 15:42.900
It's not like that with Nancy and I.

15:42.900 --> 15:45.700
Right. None of that crazy romantic
stuff for you, huh?

15:45.700 --> 15:46.800
Oh, come on.

15:46.900 --> 15:49.200
I mean, we're rational.

15:49.200 --> 15:51.900
We understand each other's
strengths and weaknesses.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.900
Sounds like building a bridge.
Have you told your daughter?

15:55.000 --> 15:56.200
No, I haven't. Not yet.

15:56.300 --> 15:59.700
I'm going to tonight.
I got a present to ease her into it.

15:59.800 --> 16:02.600
With news like this, I hope you
got her a Shetland pony.

16:02.700 --> 16:05.100
No. Something much better than that.

16:10.300 --> 16:13.200
- A book?
- Oh, come on. Don't give me that look.

16:13.300 --> 16:16.800
I know it's not that fairy tale book
you wanted, but this is better.

16:16.900 --> 16:20.100
Look at this. See?
Rosa Parks.

16:20.100 --> 16:21.300
Madame Curie.

16:21.300 --> 16:26.000
She was a remarkable woman who
dedicated her life to research...

16:26.000 --> 16:28.700
...until she died from...

16:28.800 --> 16:32.500
...radiation poisoning.
- She... died?

16:32.600 --> 16:35.800
I wonder who that is.

16:35.800 --> 16:37.300
Yeah, hi.

16:39.400 --> 16:41.900
Tomorrow morning
would be great. 7:30?

16:42.000 --> 16:44.900
<i>- With her now?
- Yes, let me call you later.</i>

16:44.900 --> 16:47.300
All right. Bye-bye.

16:47.400 --> 16:50.200
It was Nancy.

16:50.300 --> 16:52.800
- Mm-hmm?
- Mm-hmm.

16:52.900 --> 16:56.400
She's a lot like
the women in your book.

16:58.100 --> 16:59.600
Sweetie...

17:02.000 --> 17:03.800
...I'm going to ask her
to marry me.

17:03.800 --> 17:07.099
- What?
- Yeah, you like her, don't you?

17:07.099 --> 17:08.700
We all get along.

17:08.700 --> 17:11.500
- Where's she going to live?
- She's going to live with us.

17:11.599 --> 17:13.300
Do I have to give up my bedroom?

17:13.400 --> 17:16.200
No, you don't have
to give up your bedroom. No.

17:16.300 --> 17:19.300
Come on, it's going to be great.
I promise.

17:19.400 --> 17:22.700
It's not like she's gonna
try and be your mother.

17:22.700 --> 17:25.400
- Stepmother.
- She's gonna be a nice stepmother.

17:25.500 --> 17:28.400
She's gonna take you
to school tomorrow, just you and her,

17:28.500 --> 17:30.600
for some grown-up girl-bonding time.

17:30.600 --> 17:32.000
I'm only six.

17:32.100 --> 17:34.700
You won't always be.

18:06.900 --> 18:09.400
Hello!

18:09.500 --> 18:12.700
It's me, Giselle, from Andalasia.

18:13.600 --> 18:15.900
Hello!

18:15.900 --> 18:17.400
Hello!

18:18.900 --> 18:20.800
Is there anybody home?

18:20.900 --> 18:22.400
Hello, please open the door.

18:22.500 --> 18:25.000
It's very cold out here.

18:25.100 --> 18:28.800
Daddy, why is there a princess
on the castle billboard?

18:28.900 --> 18:30.900
It's an advertisement.
It's a mannequin.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.300
- She's really there!
- No, she's not. What are you doing?

18:34.300 --> 18:36.800
Get back in here! Stop!

18:36.900 --> 18:38.600
- Morgan! Stop!
- Hey!

18:38.700 --> 18:40.200
- Princess!
- Morgan!

18:40.200 --> 18:42.900
- Don't you ever do that again!
- Look! Look!

18:43.000 --> 18:46.400
Is anybody there?
Do you know Edward?

18:46.500 --> 18:48.500
- Stay here.
- Oh, please be home!

18:48.600 --> 18:51.600
- Hey, lady!
- Oh, hello.

18:51.700 --> 18:54.900
I was wondering if maybe you...
Whoa!

18:55.000 --> 18:56.800
Hang on!

18:56.900 --> 18:59.800
- Oh!
- Don't let go! Wait!

18:59.800 --> 19:02.000
- Just hang on!
- Oh, no!

19:07.400 --> 19:09.300
Catch her, Daddy!

19:10.700 --> 19:15.000
- Oh!
- Ow!

19:15.100 --> 19:18.100
- You OK?
- I'm fine.

19:18.200 --> 19:21.200
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

19:21.300 --> 19:25.500
- What were you doing up there?
- I was looking for some help.

19:25.600 --> 19:28.400
You see, I've been wandering
very far and long tonight,

19:28.500 --> 19:30.500
and I'm afraid nobody's
been nice to me.

19:30.500 --> 19:33.400
Yeah, well, welcome to New York.

19:33.500 --> 19:35.900
Thank you.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.800
Right. OK,
you sure you're all right?

19:38.800 --> 19:42.000
- Oh, yes.
- You need me to call somebody for you?

19:42.100 --> 19:44.700
Well, I don't think
they'd hear you from here.

19:44.700 --> 19:47.500
What?

19:51.000 --> 19:53.600
Morgan, show her the way, please.

19:53.700 --> 19:57.200
And then
the old hag told me to...

19:57.300 --> 20:00.100
Oh! ...look into the well
and wish for my heart's desire.

20:00.200 --> 20:02.500
But I must have looked very far

20:02.600 --> 20:06.300
because I fell,
down, down, down.

20:06.400 --> 20:08.500
And then I climbed out
of this big, round hole

20:08.600 --> 20:11.500
and I got very lost,
until I fell off of the castle.

20:11.600 --> 20:14.600
- And now here I am with you!
- Is this a big habit of yours?

20:14.600 --> 20:15.700
Falling off stuff?

20:15.800 --> 20:18.300
Well, usually someone catches me.

20:18.400 --> 20:22.800
But, not to worry, I'm certain that
Edward is already searching for me.

20:22.900 --> 20:26.900
No doubt by morning he'll come
and rescue me from this strange land.

20:27.000 --> 20:31.000
Take me home, and the two of us
can share in true love's kiss.

20:31.100 --> 20:32.100
True love's kiss?

20:32.200 --> 20:34.700
It's the most powerful thing
in the world.

20:34.700 --> 20:36.800
Right.

20:36.900 --> 20:39.700
Now if I could only find a place
to rest my head for the night.

20:39.800 --> 20:41.800
- What kind of place?
- Oh, I don't know.

20:41.900 --> 20:44.800
Maybe a nearby meadow
or a hollow tree.

20:44.900 --> 20:46.300
A hollow tree?

20:46.400 --> 20:49.700
Or a house full of dwarves.
I hear they're very hospitable.

20:49.800 --> 20:53.500
All I can do is let you in for a minute.
Dry off, use the phone if you want to.

20:53.600 --> 20:56.100
We have our own bedtime
to stick to. Let's go.

20:56.200 --> 20:58.900
That's very kind of you.

21:02.100 --> 21:04.800
- What is it with this dress of yours?
- Oh. Do you like it?

21:04.900 --> 21:06.800
- No, it's just...
- I gathered the silk

21:06.900 --> 21:10.200
from my silkworms and I spun it
into thread on my spinning wheel.

21:10.300 --> 21:13.600
- You made it all by yourself?
- Well, the mice and rabbits

21:13.700 --> 21:15.300
did help with the sewing.

21:15.400 --> 21:18.600
- They're good!
- Oh!

21:18.600 --> 21:20.300
Whoa!

21:25.200 --> 21:27.500
Why don't we see about
getting you a car.

21:30.000 --> 21:33.800
- Couldn't she sleep here, Daddy?
- No. That's a big no.

21:40.000 --> 21:43.800
- Are you really a princess?
- Not yet.

21:43.900 --> 21:45.900
But...

21:46.000 --> 21:48.800
...I will be soon.

21:57.700 --> 22:00.800
Wow, Dad.
She's really sleepy.

22:00.900 --> 22:04.400
Oh, no.
That's not acceptable. No.

22:04.500 --> 22:07.500
You're not really gonna
make her go, are you, Daddy?

22:07.500 --> 22:08.800
I want you to go to bed.

22:08.800 --> 22:11.300
But I think she might be
a real princess.

22:11.400 --> 22:16.100
Morgan, just because she has on a funny
dress, doesn't mean she's a princess.

22:16.200 --> 22:19.900
She is a seriously confused woman
who's fallen into our laps.

22:20.000 --> 22:23.300
- So we're not going to let her stay?
- No.

22:23.300 --> 22:25.700
Put on your nightgown
and go to sleep.

22:25.800 --> 22:27.200
Good night, OK?

22:33.000 --> 22:36.800
Hi. I need a car
at 116th and Riverside, please.

22:36.800 --> 22:39.100
<i>- Hold, please.
- Thank you.</i>

22:50.400 --> 22:55.100
<i>Hello, sir.
Destination, please.</i>

22:55.200 --> 22:56.800
<i>Sir?</i>

23:10.900 --> 23:12.300
- Morgan.
- What?

23:12.400 --> 23:14.200
I want you to sleep
in my room tonight.

23:14.200 --> 23:16.200
- Why?
- Just come on.

23:16.300 --> 23:18.100
All right.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.700
Fear not, Giselle!
I will rescue you!

23:28.800 --> 23:33.500
Yeah, but who's
gonna rescue me?

23:34.600 --> 23:37.600
- All right, let's close it up.
- Whoa!

23:39.100 --> 23:41.400
- Hey, buddy! You ain't...
- Silence!

23:41.400 --> 23:42.800
Guys, I got it.

23:42.900 --> 23:45.400
- Your name, peasant! Quickly!
- Arty.

23:45.400 --> 23:47.800
Are you in league with
the wicked old hag who sent

23:47.800 --> 23:50.800
my poor Giselle
to this foul place, Arty?

23:54.900 --> 23:58.700
Is this man party
to this evil plot, chipmunk?

24:09.500 --> 24:12.700
- Uh-oh.
- Aw, poor chipmunk.

24:12.800 --> 24:15.400
Speechless in my presence.

24:15.500 --> 24:17.700
What say you, sir?
Don't try my patience.

24:17.800 --> 24:20.700
- What are you talking about?
- I seek a beautiful girl.

24:20.800 --> 24:22.900
My other half,
my one coquette,

24:23.000 --> 24:24.700
the answer
to my love's duet.

24:24.700 --> 24:26.500
I'd like to
find one of them too.

24:26.600 --> 24:29.800
Then keep a wary eye out, Arty.

24:29.900 --> 24:32.300
- Come along, Pip.
- Are you OK?

24:32.400 --> 24:34.100
Hey!

24:36.000 --> 24:38.400
Hey! Get off the car, you nut!

24:38.400 --> 24:39.800
Did you see that chipmunk?

25:10.800 --> 25:13.800
Oh, my.

25:13.900 --> 25:16.100
This just won't do.

25:33.100 --> 25:34.400
Whoa!

25:50.600 --> 25:54.700
Oh, my goodness.
Are you all right?

25:54.700 --> 25:57.700
Oh.

25:57.800 --> 26:01.100
Hello.

26:02.700 --> 26:04.100
Oh...

26:08.400 --> 26:13.700
Well, it's always nice
to make new friends.

26:13.800 --> 26:17.000
All right, everyone,
let's tidy things up.

26:17.100 --> 26:22.200
<i># Come, my little friends as we all sing
a happy little working song</i>

26:22.200 --> 26:24.400
<i># Merry little voices
Clear and strong</i>

26:24.400 --> 26:27.400
<i># Come and roll your
sleeves up so to speak</i>

26:27.500 --> 26:31.000
<i># And pitch in cleaning
crud up in the kitchen</i>

26:31.100 --> 26:34.200
<i># As we sing along</i>

26:34.300 --> 26:38.900
<i># Trill a cheery tune in the tub
as you scrub a stubborn mildew stain</i>

26:39.000 --> 26:41.400
<i># Pluck a hairball
from the shower drain</i>

26:41.500 --> 26:45.400
<i># To that gay refrain
of a happy working song</i>

26:45.500 --> 26:48.500
<i># We'll keep singing
without fail</i>

26:48.500 --> 26:51.000
<i># Otherwise we'd spoil it</i>

26:51.100 --> 26:56.700
<i># Hosing down the garbage pail
and scrubbing up the toilet</i>

26:56.800 --> 27:00.700
<i># How we all enjoy letting loose with
a little "la da dum dum dum"</i>

27:00.800 --> 27:03.600
<i># While we're emptying the vacu-um</i>

27:03.700 --> 27:04.800
<i># It's such fun</i>

27:04.900 --> 27:08.500
<i>- # To hum a happy working song
- # Ooh</i>

27:08.600 --> 27:11.400
<i># A happy working song</i>

27:11.500 --> 27:16.100
<i># Oh, how strange
a place to be</i>

27:16.200 --> 27:18.600
<i># Till Edward comes for me</i>

27:18.600 --> 27:23.300
<i># My heart is sighing</i>

27:23.400 --> 27:27.100
<i># Still, as long as I am here</i>

27:27.200 --> 27:31.300
<i># I guess a new experience</i>

27:31.300 --> 27:34.100
<i># Could be worth trying</i>

27:34.200 --> 27:37.200
<i># Hey, keep drying</i>

27:37.300 --> 27:39.400
<i># You can do a lot
when you've got such</i>

27:39.500 --> 27:41.900
<i># A happy working tune to hum</i>

27:42.000 --> 27:44.100
<i># While you're sponging up
the soapy scum</i>

27:44.200 --> 27:48.200
<i># We adore each filthy chore
that we determine</i>

27:48.300 --> 27:50.800
<i># So, friends even though
you're vermin</i>

27:50.900 --> 27:56.800
<i># We're a happy working throng</i>

27:56.900 --> 27:59.300
<i># Singing as we fetch
the detergent box</i>

27:59.400 --> 28:02.400
<i># For the smelly shirts
and the stinky socks</i>

28:02.500 --> 28:04.200
<i># Sing along</i>

28:04.300 --> 28:07.100
<i># If you cannot sing
Then hum along</i>

28:07.200 --> 28:12.700
<i># As we're finishing
our happy working song #</i>

28:14.100 --> 28:15.900
Ah.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.500
Wasn't this fun?

28:21.100 --> 28:24.700
- Wake up, wake up!
- What?

28:24.800 --> 28:26.500
- Wake up!
- What is it?

28:26.600 --> 28:29.100
- Come, you have to come see!
- What is it?

28:29.200 --> 28:31.000
I can't tell you.
You have to come see!

28:31.100 --> 28:32.500
What's wrong? Are you OK?

28:32.600 --> 28:37.200
- Yes. What is it, Morgan?
- Look!

28:38.800 --> 28:42.600
Oh, my gosh. Get out! Out!

28:44.700 --> 28:47.500
- What do I do with them?
- Get them outside.

28:47.600 --> 28:49.300
- Get rid of them.
- Put them back?

28:49.300 --> 28:51.500
Put them outside!
Don't put them back.

28:51.500 --> 28:52.800
Open the door!

28:56.000 --> 28:57.900
Good! Watch out!

29:10.500 --> 29:13.100
- Stay there.
- But, Dad.

29:13.200 --> 29:14.900
Shh. Stay there.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.300
- Hello.
- Come in!

29:17.400 --> 29:22.500
- Yeah, can I...
- Oh. Good morning, Robert.

29:22.500 --> 29:26.500
Oh! That's too thoughtful of you.

29:26.600 --> 29:30.200
Thank you! Oh, I hope
you had nice dreams.

29:30.300 --> 29:34.900
- I think I'm still in one.
- This is a magical room.

29:35.000 --> 29:36.800
Where does the water come from?

29:36.800 --> 29:41.400
Uh, well, the water comes
from the pipes.

29:41.500 --> 29:45.900
- And where do the pipes get it?
- Uh, I don't know. From...

29:46.000 --> 29:50.600
...wherever the pipes get it.
- Oh.

29:50.700 --> 29:52.300
It is magical.

29:57.800 --> 30:00.700
- Hey, girlfriend.
- Hi, Nancy.

30:00.800 --> 30:03.400
What do you say,
you ready to kick it?

30:03.500 --> 30:05.200
Kick what?

30:05.300 --> 30:07.100
Why do you still have your PJ's on?

30:07.200 --> 30:09.600
It's been pretty busy around here.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.400
Wow.
It's really neat in here.

30:14.500 --> 30:18.900
- Did you guys get a maid?
- No. Not exactly.

30:18.900 --> 30:21.400
Don't worry.
My friends will do that.

30:21.400 --> 30:26.300
Oh!

30:28.000 --> 30:29.900
- Nancy?
- Oh, hello!

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
- Who is this?
- This is nothing.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.700
- I'm Giselle!
- This is nobody.

30:33.800 --> 30:36.000
I was on my way to the castle
to get married...

30:36.100 --> 30:37.600
- She's married?
- No, she's not.

30:37.700 --> 30:40.000
- Not yet!
- What does that mean, "yet"?

30:40.100 --> 30:43.300
- She was lost. I was trying to help.
- With finding the shower?

30:43.300 --> 30:45.800
The shower.
The shower is wonderful, Nancy.

30:45.900 --> 30:48.300
- I'm sure it is.
- That's enough. Thank you.

30:48.400 --> 30:51.300
- Calm down. Please, let's talk.
- Talk about what, Robert?

30:51.300 --> 30:53.800
How I never stay the night?
Because we both agreed,

30:53.900 --> 30:56.500
Morgan's here, and you have
to maintain boundaries

30:56.500 --> 30:58.800
and I thought,
"I'm so lucky. He's sensitive!"

30:58.900 --> 31:01.600
I didn't realize you were
worried about crowd control.

31:01.700 --> 31:03.300
- We'll talk.
- Don't bet on it.

31:03.300 --> 31:06.600
What about taking Morgan?
Some grown-up girl-bonding time.

31:06.600 --> 31:10.400
What, so you can have some
grown-up girl-bonding time?

31:10.500 --> 31:13.100
- I don't think so.
- But... just...

31:13.200 --> 31:14.200
Goodbye!

31:16.500 --> 31:18.700
Oh, she is lovely.

31:18.800 --> 31:21.700
Get dressed, please.
For school.

31:21.700 --> 31:24.000
Just... Please.

31:26.500 --> 31:28.400
- Nancy!
- Thirty-eight and Seventh.

31:28.400 --> 31:30.300
Nancy, wait!

31:35.600 --> 31:37.700
- Hello?
- You got to go.

31:37.800 --> 31:41.300
I don't know what your deal is,
if you're waiting for Prince Charming...

31:41.400 --> 31:43.200
- Prince Edward!
- Whatever.

31:43.300 --> 31:45.800
I'll get you to a bus,
a train, a plane, wherever,

31:45.800 --> 31:49.100
and then that's it!
I can't get involved after that.

31:52.900 --> 31:55.800
What is this?

31:55.800 --> 31:58.700
- Where did you get that?
- I made it.

31:58.800 --> 31:59.900
Do you like it?

32:02.100 --> 32:03.700
You're unhappy.

32:03.800 --> 32:05.900
You made a dress out of my curtains?

32:05.900 --> 32:08.700
Oh, you are unhappy.
I am so sorry.

32:08.800 --> 32:11.600
- I'm not unhappy, I'm angry.
- Angry?

32:11.700 --> 32:14.000
It's an unpleasant emotion.
Ever heard of it?

32:14.100 --> 32:17.300
- I have heard of it, but I...
- You have created a completely

32:17.400 --> 32:20.800
unnecessary problem with Nancy
that I now have to resolve.

32:20.900 --> 32:23.200
See, the fact is,
I was just getting ready

32:23.300 --> 32:25.800
to take a very serious step forward.

32:25.900 --> 32:28.000
- A proposal, actually.
- Oh!

32:28.100 --> 32:30.500
Well, now she's got it
in her mind that you and I...

32:30.600 --> 32:34.800
- Kissed?
- Yeah, something like that.

32:34.900 --> 32:38.100
Oh, no.

32:38.100 --> 32:40.700
- You should sing to her!
- Sing to her?

32:40.700 --> 32:43.600
And maybe that would reassure
her of your affections!

32:43.700 --> 32:47.200
You need to rush to her side
and hold her in your arms

32:47.300 --> 32:51.800
and then pour your heart out
in a beautiful ballad.

32:51.900 --> 32:55.400
And then she'll know for sure.

32:57.400 --> 32:59.600
- Why are you staring at me?
- I don't know.

32:59.600 --> 33:02.900
It's like you escaped from
a Hallmark card or something.

33:02.900 --> 33:06.000
Is that a bad thing?

33:06.100 --> 33:09.600
School! We're late!
We've got to run!

33:09.600 --> 33:11.700
Oh!

33:15.800 --> 33:21.700
Oh, wouldn't she just love to come
crawling back here and steal my crown!

33:21.800 --> 33:25.700
Cast me aside like
so much royal rubbish! What?

33:25.700 --> 33:28.900
Perhaps Prince Edward won't find her.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.300
- Perhaps he will!
- Oh! Oh, dear.

33:36.400 --> 33:38.500
Oh...

33:38.600 --> 33:43.800
Oh! I do wish there was someone
who cared enough for me

33:43.900 --> 33:46.700
to go after him.

33:46.800 --> 33:52.500
Oh, a man like that,
strong and brave,

33:52.500 --> 33:56.400
I'd do anything for him.

33:56.500 --> 33:58.700
Never fear, my queen.

33:58.800 --> 34:02.100
I will stop him!

34:10.300 --> 34:12.900
- What now?
- Another one?

34:13.000 --> 34:15.900
Whoa! Get him out of there.
Let's go. Get in there.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.699
Where are these people coming from?

34:17.800 --> 34:19.300
- Come on!
- Upsy-daisy.

34:19.300 --> 34:22.199
Get him up.

34:22.300 --> 34:24.000
- Hey, pal.
- Yow!

34:24.100 --> 34:27.500
Let me guess. You're, uh,
looking for a beautiful girl too.

34:27.500 --> 34:29.300
No.

34:29.400 --> 34:31.699
I'm looking for a prince, actually.

34:33.300 --> 34:36.400
Right.

34:38.900 --> 34:43.000
You've met your match,
you foul bellowing beast!

34:52.800 --> 34:56.800
- Everybody, stay on the bus.
- Giselle? My love?

34:56.900 --> 34:59.300
Drat!

34:59.400 --> 35:02.900
The steel beast is dead, peasants.
I set you all free.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.900
- Move that bus!
- Come on, already!

35:05.900 --> 35:08.900
- Get that bus out of there!
- Are you crazy?

35:09.000 --> 35:12.400
Nobody stabs my bus!
I'll tear you apart!

35:12.400 --> 35:14.100
Do you hear me?

35:14.200 --> 35:16.300
- You get down here!
- If you'll allow me...

35:16.400 --> 35:20.100
- Nathaniel, old friend!
- Sire, may I suggest that you...

35:20.200 --> 35:23.800
You? A friend of his?
Crazy tight-wearing...

35:23.800 --> 35:26.700
Come here and mess up my route?
I'll tear you both apart!

35:26.800 --> 35:30.100
Don't you roll your eyes at me!

35:30.100 --> 35:33.400
A rat!
Get it away from me!

35:33.400 --> 35:36.100
Well, strictly speaking,
he's a chipmunk.

35:36.200 --> 35:40.500
Sire, may I suggest we seek elsewhere

35:40.600 --> 35:42.200
for your bride?

36:01.200 --> 36:03.400
- What are you looking at?
- She's beautiful.

36:03.400 --> 36:05.000
It's just a statue!

36:05.600 --> 36:07.900
Come quickly. Quickly.

36:07.900 --> 36:10.700
Sam? Sam, please don't tell me
Mrs. Banks is already here.

36:10.800 --> 36:12.400
- Mrs. Banks is here.
- Great.

36:12.500 --> 36:14.000
With Mr. Banks and his lawyer.

36:14.100 --> 36:16.100
- Perfect, how long?
- Do you want to know?

36:16.200 --> 36:18.800
No, I don't. I need you to
handle something for me, OK?

36:18.900 --> 36:20.300
- See this girl?
- Who is she?

36:20.400 --> 36:22.800
No idea. I'm pretty sure
she's from out of town.

36:22.800 --> 36:25.000
- What do I do?
- Find out where she's from,

36:25.100 --> 36:27.300
and get her there.
And make sure it's cheap.

36:27.400 --> 36:29.300
If Nancy calls me,
I need to talk to her.

36:29.300 --> 36:31.300
Giselle? Don't drink that, OK?

36:31.300 --> 36:33.700
I have a meeting.
Sam is gonna get you home.

36:33.700 --> 36:35.900
Sam? This is Giselle.
Giselle, this is Sam.

36:35.900 --> 36:37.500
- Yes? Hi.
- Stay out of trouble.

36:40.400 --> 36:43.800
Oh... Oh.

36:43.900 --> 36:47.700
- It's nice to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you too.

36:57.200 --> 36:58.400
Your Majesty.

36:58.400 --> 37:01.200
- Nathaniel!
- Your Majesty?

37:03.100 --> 37:05.100
Nathaniel, here!

37:06.300 --> 37:08.200
Nathaniel!

37:11.400 --> 37:15.600
Finally. Finally.
I'm boiling in here.

37:15.600 --> 37:19.200
- Have you found her yet?
- I'm afraid I haven't, My Lady.

37:19.300 --> 37:22.500
Time is of the essence.

37:22.600 --> 37:25.500
We can't risk my stepson
bringing the girl back.

37:25.600 --> 37:27.600
He shan't, Your Majesty!
I swear it!

37:27.600 --> 37:32.000
No, he shan't. I intend to make
absolutely certain of that.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.800
But, Your Majesty,
how exactly did you...?

37:36.100 --> 37:40.800
...ever end up tasting so...
Mmm... delicious?

37:42.800 --> 37:45.500
Poisoned apples, My Lady.

37:45.500 --> 37:49.100
- You want me to...?
- Don't you see, my darling?

37:49.200 --> 37:54.300
If there's ever going to be
a happily ever after for us...

37:54.400 --> 37:56.700
- Hmm?
- Happily...

37:56.800 --> 38:00.200
...ever after?
Oh, My Lady.

38:00.300 --> 38:02.500
Mmm, yes.
It won't be difficult.

38:02.600 --> 38:06.100
It's just one bite.
That's all it takes.

38:06.200 --> 38:10.300
One small bite to drag her down

38:10.400 --> 38:14.200
into a deep and troubled sleep.

38:14.200 --> 38:16.700
And when the hands
of the clock strike 12,

38:16.800 --> 38:20.200
that precious little pretender
to my throne

38:20.300 --> 38:22.400
will be gone!

38:22.500 --> 38:25.900
It shall be done, My Lady.

38:25.900 --> 38:27.900
- I swear it.
- Yes.

38:28.000 --> 38:31.300
You'll find the girl
at Columbus Circle...

38:32.300 --> 38:33.800
Your Majesty?

38:37.300 --> 38:39.300
Hello.

38:39.300 --> 38:41.200
You little...

38:41.200 --> 38:43.400
Whoa! Hey!

38:54.300 --> 38:56.800
- Pip!
- Sire! Sire, please. I beg of you.

38:56.900 --> 39:00.400
Don't listen to that
insane little vermin.

39:00.500 --> 39:02.400
He's probably eaten some bad nuts.

39:02.500 --> 39:04.500
We should put him down
for his own good.

39:04.600 --> 39:06.300
Nathaniel, please.
Let him speak.

39:06.400 --> 39:09.500
But, sire! No. He's delirious.
He came to tell all sorts of...

39:14.500 --> 39:16.800
Go ahead, Pip.

39:16.800 --> 39:19.500
What is it you want to say?

39:19.600 --> 39:22.200
You watch me. OK?

39:23.400 --> 39:26.200
Nathaniel?

39:26.300 --> 39:28.800
Uh-huh. Nathaniel...

39:28.900 --> 39:32.600
- Nathaniel's glad to have me near.
- No, no, no.

39:32.700 --> 39:35.600
Hmm... Oh!

39:52.300 --> 39:54.200
Oh, oh, oh!
I know this.

39:54.300 --> 39:57.200
- Uh...
- Apple?

39:57.300 --> 39:59.000
No, thank you.

39:59.000 --> 40:00.500
It's good.

40:00.600 --> 40:03.000
Oh, OK.

40:06.800 --> 40:08.300
Ta-da!

40:13.100 --> 40:16.600
You feel you'd die without me here.

40:20.300 --> 40:21.800
Yes. Here we go. Good.

40:21.800 --> 40:24.700
Well, I have to say,
I really think that went well.

40:24.800 --> 40:27.200
There's no reason not
to be reasonable.

40:27.200 --> 40:30.400
Great. We might be in the
neighborhood of a settlement.

40:30.500 --> 40:33.000
Excuse me. I'm gonna
check on your cars for a second.

40:33.100 --> 40:34.600
- Sorry.
- What? What?

40:34.700 --> 40:37.000
She has no driver's license.
No passport.

40:37.100 --> 40:38.900
Can't find this place she comes from.

40:39.000 --> 40:40.100
- What place?
- Andalusia.

40:40.200 --> 40:41.400
- Andalasia.
- Whatever.

40:41.500 --> 40:43.500
I've called every travel agent.

40:43.500 --> 40:45.700
I don't know if it's
a country or a city.

40:45.800 --> 40:48.900
- It can't be a state.
- More like a state of mind.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.900
She told me it's just
beyond the Meadows of Joy

40:51.900 --> 40:55.000
and the Valley of Contentment.
What is that all about?

40:57.800 --> 41:01.600
Oh, my goodness.
Your hair is lovely.

41:01.700 --> 41:04.200
- You're beautiful.
- Well, thank you.

41:04.300 --> 41:07.100
The man who holds your heart
is a lucky fellow indeed.

41:07.200 --> 41:10.000
- You try telling him that.
- I'm certain he already knows.

41:10.100 --> 41:13.700
- Excuse me?
- Are you him?

41:13.800 --> 41:17.900
You are very lucky. Just look
at the way her eyes sparkle.

41:17.900 --> 41:20.900
- It's no wonder you're in love.
- I got it!

41:21.000 --> 41:24.200
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
Giselle? Please?

41:24.300 --> 41:27.300
It's not like that, all right?
They're not together anymore.

41:27.400 --> 41:29.800
- I don't understand.
- They're getting a divorce.

41:29.900 --> 41:32.700
- Separating from each other.
- Separating?

41:32.700 --> 41:34.400
- Yeah.
- For how long?

41:34.500 --> 41:37.600
- Forever.
- Forever and ever?

41:37.700 --> 41:40.500
Shh. Yes.

41:40.600 --> 41:43.200
- Oh, no.
- What are you doing?

41:43.300 --> 41:45.400
- Don't cry.
- Are you crying?

41:45.500 --> 41:47.400
- She's not.
- I'm sorry. I can't help it.

41:47.500 --> 41:50.200
- Is she actually crying?
- It's just so sad.

41:50.300 --> 41:52.700
What kind of an operation
are you running here?

41:52.800 --> 41:54.400
This is so unprofessional.

41:54.400 --> 41:57.000
Good morning, Phoebe.
How are you? It's good to...

41:57.100 --> 41:59.500
If you guys
are trying to manipulate us,

41:59.600 --> 42:02.300
you can throw this whole deal out.

42:04.300 --> 42:06.400
What is going on here?
Who's she?

42:06.500 --> 42:09.000
Uh, a friend. No, she's
an acquaintance, actually.

42:09.100 --> 42:12.300
You begged me to put you on the case,
and this is what I get for it?

42:12.300 --> 42:14.500
I walk in here
and find everybody upset?

42:14.600 --> 42:16.800
<i>And some girl is crying
like we're on Oprah.</i>

42:16.900 --> 42:20.100
I'll take care of it.
Carl, it's gonna be fine.

42:20.200 --> 42:22.600
- What is wrong with you?
- Me?

42:22.700 --> 42:25.300
<i>Yes, you. This whole Kumbaya,
Up With People routine.</i>

42:25.400 --> 42:28.300
- Those people are in real pain.
- Of course they're in pain.

42:28.300 --> 42:29.700
They're separated forever.

42:29.800 --> 42:31.900
Married one day
and the next they're not.

42:31.900 --> 42:34.500
- What sort of awful place is this?
- It's reality.

42:34.500 --> 42:36.800
Well, I think I'd prefer to be
in Andalasia.

42:36.900 --> 42:39.700
- I think I'd prefer that too.
- Get in, please.

42:41.700 --> 42:46.700
I wonder if we might cover
more ground separately, sire.

42:46.800 --> 42:50.700
Uh, you by yourself,
and me with it.

42:50.800 --> 42:53.500
An inspired plan, Nathaniel.

42:53.600 --> 42:55.800
Where do you suppose I should look?

43:07.000 --> 43:09.200
Look, sire! Over there!

43:09.300 --> 43:10.700
Ah! Giselle!

43:10.800 --> 43:14.700
Run to her, sire! Hurry!
Not a moment to lose!

43:14.800 --> 43:18.000
- Giselle!
- I try to do the right thing.

43:18.000 --> 43:19.600
Oh, you've been very nice to me.

43:19.700 --> 43:23.700
Severely punished for it.
OK, look, Giselle?

43:23.800 --> 43:25.900
- I can't help you anymore. OK?
- What?

43:26.000 --> 43:29.600
Here's some money. I want you
to take it. Call your prince.

43:29.700 --> 43:31.600
Have him pick you up,
bring his horse.

43:31.600 --> 43:34.500
Because I honestly,
I just can't handle it.

43:34.500 --> 43:37.900
- Robert?
- Just go.

43:38.000 --> 43:40.300
I'm so sorry.

43:40.400 --> 43:43.200
You have been a very kind friend
to me when I had none.

43:43.300 --> 43:47.700
And I would never want to make you
unhappy or cause you any trouble, so...

43:49.400 --> 43:51.200
...I'll go.

43:51.200 --> 43:55.800
I wish you every happiness.

44:18.600 --> 44:20.400
You have lovely friends.

44:20.500 --> 44:23.700
Would you like to feed
the birds? Just a dollar a bag.

44:23.800 --> 44:25.800
Certainly.

44:25.800 --> 44:27.600
By chance,
have you seen my prince?

44:27.700 --> 44:29.700
He was here.

44:29.700 --> 44:32.500
- Do you really think so?
- Oh, yes.

44:32.600 --> 44:35.100
- Oh!
- Giselle? What are you doing?

44:35.200 --> 44:38.200
- Robert! This is Clara.
- Mm-hmm.

44:38.300 --> 44:39.800
- She saw Edward.
- Oh.

44:39.800 --> 44:42.200
He was on the bus this morning.

44:42.300 --> 44:46.000
- He tried to kill me!
- Great. Wonderful. Thank you.

44:46.000 --> 44:47.400
- Oh!
- What are you thinking?

44:47.500 --> 44:50.100
- You can't just give people money.
- You gave me money.

44:50.200 --> 44:53.500
- That's not the point.
- And she was very helpful.

44:53.500 --> 44:55.600
So, what's the deal,
this prince of yours?

44:55.600 --> 44:59.600
- How long you two been together?
- Oh, about a day.

44:59.600 --> 45:02.200
You mean it feels like a day
because you're so in love?

45:02.300 --> 45:06.100
- No. It's been a day.
- You're kidding me. A day?

45:06.200 --> 45:07.800
- One day?
- Yes.

45:07.900 --> 45:11.300
- And tomorrow will be two days.
- You're joking.

45:11.400 --> 45:13.200
- No. I'm not.
- Yeah, you are.

45:13.200 --> 45:14.800
But I'm not.

45:14.900 --> 45:18.500
You're gonna marry somebody after a day
because you fell in love with him?

45:18.500 --> 45:21.100
Yes.

45:21.100 --> 45:22.700
Yes!

45:27.400 --> 45:30.300
Oh! Ooh!

45:31.700 --> 45:34.300
I don't get it. How can you talk
about loving some guy

45:34.300 --> 45:37.500
- you don't even know?
- Well, I know what's in his heart.

45:37.600 --> 45:40.000
Oh, OK. Great.

45:40.100 --> 45:42.200
This was so yummy.

45:42.300 --> 45:44.500
I didn't know that food
could taste like this.

45:44.600 --> 45:46.900
- You all done? OK.
- Mmm!

45:46.900 --> 45:49.900
- Let me put that out for you.
- What about you?

45:50.000 --> 45:54.300
- How long have you known your Nancy?
- Uh, it's five years.

45:54.400 --> 45:57.100
- And you haven't proposed?
- Well, no. I...

45:57.200 --> 45:58.700
Well, no wonder she's angry.

45:58.800 --> 46:01.000
Hello, nice lady.

46:01.100 --> 46:05.000
You want juicy,
sweet caramel apple, maybe?

46:05.000 --> 46:06.200
Mm.

46:06.200 --> 46:08.900
No charge for the beautiful
young woman.

46:08.900 --> 46:10.800
- Oh, really. It's free?
- Of course!

46:10.900 --> 46:13.600
Today is free caramel apple day.

46:13.700 --> 46:18.000
Tomorrow is free beef... jerky.

46:18.100 --> 46:20.500
Thank you very much, kind sir.

46:20.600 --> 46:24.800
You're welcome, miss.

46:24.900 --> 46:26.600
You...

46:30.700 --> 46:32.800
Shut up.

46:32.900 --> 46:36.100
Most normal people get to know
each other before they get married.

46:36.200 --> 46:38.400
They date.

46:38.400 --> 46:40.600
- Date?
- Yeah. You know, date.

46:40.700 --> 46:43.800
You go someplace special.
You know, like a restaurant,

46:43.900 --> 46:47.900
or a movie, a museum. Or you
just hang out and you talk.

46:48.000 --> 46:51.200
- What do you talk about?
- About each other.

46:51.200 --> 46:53.700
About yourself.
About your interests.

46:53.800 --> 46:56.000
Your likes, your dislikes.
You talk!

46:56.100 --> 46:58.800
You have such strange
ideas about love.

46:58.800 --> 47:02.500
Maybe we should do what you would do.
You meet, have lunch, and get married.

47:02.600 --> 47:04.600
Oh! You forgot
about happily ever after.

47:04.700 --> 47:07.000
Forget "happily ever after."
It doesn't exist.

47:07.100 --> 47:09.400
Well, of course it does.
Oh!

47:09.400 --> 47:11.400
Oh!

47:11.500 --> 47:14.500
I hate to disagree,
but marriages are a success

47:14.600 --> 47:15.900
if they manage not to end.

47:15.900 --> 47:18.700
- Forget about happiness.
- What about you and Nancy?

47:18.800 --> 47:21.100
You know that you will
live happily ever after.

47:21.200 --> 47:25.600
I don't know if I'll make it
through today, let alone a lifetime.

47:25.700 --> 47:28.300
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
It's complicated.

47:28.400 --> 47:30.500
But it doesn't have to be.

47:30.500 --> 47:33.200
- Not if she knows.
- Knows what?

47:33.300 --> 47:35.800
- How much you really love her.
- Of course she does.

47:35.800 --> 47:39.000
We just don't talk about it every minute
of the day, but she knows.

47:39.000 --> 47:40.800
- How?
- What do you mean, "how?"

47:40.900 --> 47:44.500
<i># How does she know</i>

47:44.600 --> 47:47.600
<i>- # You love her?
- No. Don't.</i>

47:47.700 --> 47:51.200
<i>- # How does she know
- People looking.</i>

47:51.300 --> 47:55.300
<i>- # She's yours?
- Don't sing. It's OK.</i>

47:55.400 --> 47:57.700
Let's just walk.
Can we walk? OK?

47:57.700 --> 47:59.200
- Well, does she?
- Yeah.

47:59.300 --> 48:01.600
<i># How does she know
that you love her?</i>

48:01.700 --> 48:03.300
- Oh.
- He knows the song too?

48:03.400 --> 48:05.800
<i># How do you
show her you love her?</i>

48:07.600 --> 48:10.000
<i># How does she know
that you really</i>

48:10.100 --> 48:13.200
<i>- # Really, truly love her?
- I've never heard this song.</i>

48:13.300 --> 48:15.600
<i># How does she know
that you love her?</i>

48:15.700 --> 48:18.600
<i>- # How do you show her you love her?
- Really nice work.</i>

48:18.700 --> 48:21.600
<i>- # How does she know that you really
- That's it. OK.</i>

48:21.700 --> 48:23.800
<i>- # Truly love her?
- Let's go.</i>

48:23.900 --> 48:28.800
<i># It's not enough to take
the one you love for granted</i>

48:28.900 --> 48:33.700
<i># You must remind her
or she'll be inclined to say</i>

48:33.800 --> 48:36.800
<i># How do I know</i>

48:36.900 --> 48:39.200
<i># He loves me?</i>

48:39.200 --> 48:42.100
<i># How do I know</i>

48:42.200 --> 48:44.700
<i># He's mine?</i>

48:44.800 --> 48:47.900
<i># Well, does he leave
a little note to tell you</i>

48:48.000 --> 48:51.000
<i># You are on his mind?</i>

48:51.000 --> 48:54.800
<i># Send you yellow flowers
when the sky is gray?</i>

48:54.900 --> 48:59.400
<i># Hey, he'll find
a new way to show you</i>

48:59.500 --> 49:02.300
<i># A little bit every day</i>

49:02.400 --> 49:04.900
<i># That's how you know</i>

49:05.000 --> 49:09.400
<i># That's how you know
he's your love</i>

49:09.500 --> 49:12.100
- See?
- I've seen quite enough. Let's go.

49:12.200 --> 49:13.800
- A ball?
- Yeah.

49:13.900 --> 49:17.100
- That would be fun!
- That would not be fun.

49:19.300 --> 49:22.000
<i># You got to show her
you need her</i>

49:22.000 --> 49:24.700
<i># Don't treat her
like a mind reader</i>

49:24.700 --> 49:27.100
<i># Each day do something
to lead her</i>

49:27.200 --> 49:30.000
<i># To believe you love her</i>

49:30.100 --> 49:34.800
<i># Everybody wants to live
happily ever after</i>

49:34.900 --> 49:39.800
<i># Everybody wants to know
their true love is true</i>

49:39.800 --> 49:45.500
<i># How do you
know he loves you?</i>

49:45.600 --> 49:50.800
<i># How do you know he's yours?</i>

49:50.800 --> 49:56.200
<i># Well, does he take you out dancing
just so he can hold you close?</i>

49:56.300 --> 49:57.500
I don't dance.

49:57.600 --> 50:02.000
<i># Dedicate a song with words
meant just for you? Ooh</i>

50:02.100 --> 50:05.900
<i>- And I really don't sing.
- # He'll find his own way to tell you</i>

50:06.000 --> 50:08.600
<i># With the little things he'll do</i>

50:08.700 --> 50:10.900
<i># That's how you know</i>

50:11.000 --> 50:16.300
<i># That's how you know
he's your love</i>

50:18.800 --> 50:23.200
<i># He's your love</i>

50:23.200 --> 50:25.400
Giselle!

50:28.900 --> 50:33.900
<i># I've been dreaming...</i>

50:40.200 --> 50:42.800
Take these flowers to Nancy, please?

50:42.900 --> 50:45.900
Are you crazy? They're birds.
They don't know where she lives.

50:48.600 --> 50:51.600
<i># That's how you know</i>

50:51.700 --> 50:54.100
<i># He loves you</i>

50:54.200 --> 50:57.000
<i># That's how you know</i>

50:57.100 --> 50:59.200
<i># It's true</i>

50:59.200 --> 51:02.000
<i># Because he'll wear
your favorite color</i>

51:02.000 --> 51:05.700
<i># Just so he can match your eyes</i>

51:05.800 --> 51:07.600
<i># Plan a private picnic</i>

51:07.700 --> 51:11.800
<i># By the fire's glow, oh</i>

51:11.900 --> 51:14.400
<i># His heart'll be yours forever</i>

51:14.500 --> 51:17.300
<i># Something every day
will show</i>

51:17.400 --> 51:20.000
<i># That's how you know</i>

51:20.000 --> 51:22.500
<i># That's how you know</i>

51:22.600 --> 51:25.500
<i># That's how you know</i>

51:25.600 --> 51:28.300
<i># That's how you know</i>

51:28.400 --> 51:30.800
<i># That's how you know</i>

51:30.900 --> 51:33.000
<i># That's how you know</i>

51:33.100 --> 51:34.400
<i># He's your love</i>

51:34.400 --> 51:36.700
<i># That's how she knows
that you love her</i>

51:36.800 --> 51:39.100
<i># That's how you show her
you love her</i>

51:39.200 --> 51:43.600
<i>- # That's how you know
- # You've got to show her you need her</i>

51:43.700 --> 51:48.900
<i># That's how you know</i>

51:49.000 --> 51:55.000
<i># He's your love #</i>

51:58.300 --> 51:59.300
Thank you.

52:03.219 --> 52:06.347
Thank you.

52:06.422 --> 52:09.289
So much. Thank you.

52:09.358 --> 52:12.122
<i>- Nancy?
- Thank you so much for the flowers.</i>

52:12.194 --> 52:14.754
Well, you're welcome.
No, I'm glad you liked them.

52:14.830 --> 52:17.060
<i>- She got the flowers.
- Catch you at a bad time?</i>

52:17.133 --> 52:19.533
Yeah. You wouldn't believe
where I am right now.

52:19.602 --> 52:23.299
Sire! Oh dear, oh dear.

52:23.372 --> 52:27.138
- You've fallen on your royal...
- I know.

52:28.277 --> 52:29.574
Ah!

52:41.557 --> 52:43.388
- I love them so much.
- Really?

52:43.459 --> 52:46.485
Usually you send those e-mail cards
with the digital flowers.

52:46.562 --> 52:49.827
These are exquisite. Where do you find
live doves in New York City?

52:49.899 --> 52:52.766
- Oh, it's a long story.
- And these? Oh!

52:52.835 --> 52:54.962
- We're going to a ball?
- You don't have to.

52:55.037 --> 52:57.198
Are you kidding me?
It's so romantic.

52:57.273 --> 52:59.434
- So spontaneous!
- Good.

52:59.508 --> 53:02.671
- I can't wait.
- Good. Great.

53:02.745 --> 53:04.269
And...

53:04.347 --> 53:07.612
...as far as Giselle's concerned,
I'm just trying to help her.

53:07.683 --> 53:09.207
- Nothing's...
- You know what?

53:09.285 --> 53:13.949
If you say nothing happened,
nothing happened. I trust you.

53:14.023 --> 53:18.756
- So tomorrow night, then.
- This is so unlike you.

53:56.699 --> 54:00.567
<i>... middle of Times Square with that bus
driver who was ambushed earlier today</i>

54:00.636 --> 54:04.663
It appears this odd little box
controls the magic mirror.

54:04.740 --> 54:08.301
<i>They were dressed
all freaky. Then this chipmunk...</i>

54:08.377 --> 54:11.107
<i>I've always been in love with you.</i>

54:12.581 --> 54:16.017
<i>Don't you have any self-respect?</i>

54:18.054 --> 54:20.113
<i>I don't need self-respect.</i>

54:21.390 --> 54:23.153
<i>I just need your lips against mine.</i>

54:24.894 --> 54:28.853
Wait, sire!
Go back! Go back! Please!

54:28.931 --> 54:32.731
<i>How could I love a man
who doesn't even like himself?</i>

54:38.874 --> 54:42.332
<i>Get away from me, Jerry!
You disgust me!</i>

54:42.411 --> 54:45.437
<i>I can't help my
feelings for you, Angela.</i>

54:45.514 --> 54:48.244
<i>It's love that makes me
act this crazy.</i>

54:48.317 --> 54:51.809
<i>This isn't love.
This is infatuation.</i>

54:53.589 --> 54:56.183
Shh, shh, shh.

54:56.258 --> 54:57.748
Oh. Shh.

55:01.430 --> 55:02.954
Nathaniel likes the way I leap?

55:07.970 --> 55:09.938
I'm handsome even when I sleep?

55:15.678 --> 55:17.703
Sad little chipmunk.

55:17.780 --> 55:21.181
Aw, deranged from exhaustion.

55:21.250 --> 55:25.380
Aw. Maybe you'd like to snuggle
in a nice little nook

55:25.454 --> 55:27.217
for the night, eh?

55:42.204 --> 55:44.399
Night-night.

55:46.876 --> 55:49.674
Sleep tight.

55:49.745 --> 55:52.339
I think I need some air, sire.

55:55.718 --> 55:58.846
<i>I don't like them sad endings.</i>

56:02.258 --> 56:03.850
Sire.

56:04.593 --> 56:06.993
Do you...

56:07.062 --> 56:08.427
...like yourself?

56:10.032 --> 56:12.023
What's not to like?

57:03.886 --> 57:05.353
Where'd he go?

57:07.089 --> 57:09.717
<i># When the moon hits your eye</i>

57:09.792 --> 57:12.522
<i># Like a big pizza pie...</i>

57:12.595 --> 57:15.086
Oh, yeah. Here.
Watch this.

57:15.164 --> 57:18.930
Watch very carefully. I'm gonna
put it in this hand like that.

57:19.001 --> 57:21.731
Oh, do it again! Show me!
That's wonderful.

57:21.804 --> 57:23.897
- Show me again!
- All right. Last time.

57:23.973 --> 57:25.372
There you go. There it is.

57:25.441 --> 57:27.170
And look.

57:28.677 --> 57:31.168
You're a wizard!

57:34.783 --> 57:36.273
What?

57:37.653 --> 57:39.848
- This is a very nice place.
- Yeah.

57:39.922 --> 57:42.755
- And we're eating dinner?
- Yeah.

57:42.825 --> 57:45.385
- This is a date.
- Yeah.

57:45.461 --> 57:49.022
No! No! No, no. We're just...

57:49.098 --> 57:51.089
We're just friends.

57:51.166 --> 57:55.102
Besides, people don't usually
bring their children on dates.

57:56.071 --> 57:57.538
That's too bad.

57:57.606 --> 58:01.235
Morgan's a lovely girl.
She's very kind and very sweet.

58:01.310 --> 58:03.278
Yeah. She's great.

58:05.848 --> 58:10.080
- What?
- Does she miss her terribly?

58:10.152 --> 58:11.949
- Miss who?
- Her mother.

58:12.021 --> 58:13.386
Um...

58:14.623 --> 58:16.648
- Well, we just...
- What?

58:19.128 --> 58:21.153
- We don't talk about it.
- Oh.

58:21.230 --> 58:23.391
I'm very sorry.
I didn't mean to pry.

58:23.465 --> 58:25.626
No, no. It's OK.
It's just...

58:27.369 --> 58:31.829
I don't talk about it...
to Morgan or to anybody.

58:31.907 --> 58:35.308
- Because it was very sad?
- Not at first.

58:35.377 --> 58:39.108
- You were in love.
- Yeah.

58:39.181 --> 58:41.411
Yeah.

58:41.483 --> 58:44.475
- That was the problem.
- How could that be a problem?

58:44.553 --> 58:48.216
Because love... The lovey-dovey
version that you talk about?

58:48.290 --> 58:50.383
It's fantasy.

58:50.459 --> 58:52.893
And one day,
you have to wake up and...

58:54.330 --> 58:57.925
...you're in the real world.
- What made you wake up?

58:59.702 --> 59:01.397
Well...

59:04.807 --> 59:06.365
...she left.

59:08.811 --> 59:12.372
- I'm so sorry for you both.
- It's OK.

59:12.448 --> 59:15.144
I'm a big boy.
I can handle it.

59:15.217 --> 59:16.946
It's her I worry about, though.

59:17.019 --> 59:20.853
I know she's shy. I know she
doesn't have very many friends.

59:20.923 --> 59:22.948
I just want her to be strong,
you know?

59:23.025 --> 59:25.858
To be able to face
the world for what it is.

59:25.928 --> 59:28.158
That's why I don't
encourage the fairy tales.

59:28.230 --> 59:30.323
I don't want to set her up

59:30.399 --> 59:33.163
to believe in this
"dreams come true" nonsense.

59:33.235 --> 59:35.567
But dreams do come true.

59:35.637 --> 59:38.333
And maybe something
wonderful will happen.

59:38.407 --> 59:41.808
Yeah, well, I forgot
who I was talking to.

59:41.877 --> 59:44.607
Well, I hope you don't forget.

59:44.680 --> 59:45.806
I like talking to you.

59:45.881 --> 59:48.543
For the nice lady.

59:48.617 --> 59:50.676
From a secret admirer.

59:50.753 --> 59:53.085
How come people keep
giving you free stuff?

59:53.155 --> 59:57.751
- What is it?
- It's an apple martini, miss.

59:57.826 --> 01:00:00.260
Apple mar... Ooh!
It looks yummy.

01:00:00.329 --> 01:00:02.524
Be careful. It's poisonous.

01:00:04.032 --> 01:00:06.330
- You're joking.
- Yeah.

01:00:07.669 --> 01:00:09.933
They'll creep up on you.
I'd be careful.

01:00:10.005 --> 01:00:14.874
- Well, I'll just have one sip.
- A sip is all it takes.

01:00:14.943 --> 01:00:16.240
Oh.

01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:21.078
- Hi-yah!
- Oh!

01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:22.777
You miserable...

01:00:22.851 --> 01:00:25.615
There's a rodent on the table!
Can we get some help here?

01:00:25.687 --> 01:00:27.621
He's telling me something!

01:00:27.689 --> 01:00:31.056
Pip, you're here! Oh!

01:00:32.428 --> 01:00:34.953
- It's chewing off her face!
- A chipmunk!

01:00:35.030 --> 01:00:36.964
That thing's loaded with disease.

01:00:37.032 --> 01:00:38.761
Edward is here!

01:00:38.834 --> 01:00:42.531
- Edward is here!
- I'll save you, miss!

01:00:42.604 --> 01:00:44.333
Oh, my! Pip?

01:00:44.406 --> 01:00:46.966
- Okey-dokey.
- Duck!

01:00:51.046 --> 01:00:52.479
Let me see your face.

01:00:52.548 --> 01:00:56.507
I'm fine!
Pip wouldn't scratch me! No!

01:00:56.585 --> 01:01:00.783
- Where's Pip? Where is he?
- The pizza's breathing!

01:01:03.659 --> 01:01:05.524
Oh! Pip!

01:01:17.739 --> 01:01:18.967
Oh, no.

01:01:21.043 --> 01:01:22.203
Pip.

01:01:22.277 --> 01:01:24.177
What's wrong? Are you OK?

01:01:25.047 --> 01:01:26.810
Oh, Daddy.

01:01:34.089 --> 01:01:37.684
Tell me magic mirror,
what is this awful place?

01:01:37.759 --> 01:01:40.557
Why is everything so difficult?

01:01:40.629 --> 01:01:42.961
Will I ever find my heart's duet?

01:01:43.031 --> 01:01:46.626
<i>Preliminary search of the pizza oven
did not reveal any rodent remains.</i>

01:01:46.702 --> 01:01:48.260
<i>This animal's still out there.</i>

01:01:48.337 --> 01:01:50.897
<i>Joining us is the woman
who was attacked</i>

01:01:50.973 --> 01:01:52.497
<i>- by this chipmunk.
- Giselle!</i>

01:01:52.574 --> 01:01:54.303
<i>Tell us, how does it feel</i>

01:01:54.376 --> 01:01:57.641
<i>knowing this dangerous animal
is most likely still alive?</i>

01:01:57.713 --> 01:02:01.479
<i>Wonderful! Pip is my very
best friend, and...</i>

01:02:01.550 --> 01:02:03.017
<i>Giselle, why don't we go home?</i>

01:02:03.085 --> 01:02:05.349
<i>I wasn't finished.
One more question, please.</i>

01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:07.115
What villainy is this?

01:02:07.189 --> 01:02:10.181
<i>Is this unprovoked attack
part of some new trend?</i>

01:02:10.259 --> 01:02:13.854
<i>- Is rodent rage on the rise?
- Magic mirror, I beg you.</i>

01:02:13.929 --> 01:02:16.454
<i>- Tell me where she is!
- From 116th and Broadway...</i>

01:02:16.532 --> 01:02:21.060
116th and Broadway!
Thank you, mirror.

01:02:21.136 --> 01:02:23.195
<i>... I'm Mary Ilene Caselotti.</i>

01:02:23.272 --> 01:02:27.003
My goodness. We sure
had a lot of excitement tonight.

01:02:27.075 --> 01:02:29.873
- Were you scared earlier?
- A little bit.

01:02:29.945 --> 01:02:32.436
But do you
think Pip will be OK?

01:02:32.514 --> 01:02:34.778
Oh, I wouldn't
worry about Pip.

01:02:34.850 --> 01:02:36.841
He is very brave.

01:02:36.919 --> 01:02:40.685
I remember this one time
when the poor wolf

01:02:40.756 --> 01:02:42.781
was being chased by
Little Red Riding Hood

01:02:42.858 --> 01:02:46.954
around his grandmother's house
and she had an axe. Oh.

01:02:47.029 --> 01:02:49.020
And if Pip hadn't
been walking by to help,

01:02:49.097 --> 01:02:51.793
I don't know
what would've happened.

01:02:51.867 --> 01:02:54.802
I don't really
remember that version.

01:02:54.870 --> 01:02:57.771
Well, that's because Red
tells it a little differently.

01:02:58.807 --> 01:02:59.865
Good night, Giselle.

01:02:59.942 --> 01:03:01.933
And thank you for the nice story.

01:03:02.010 --> 01:03:03.773
Good night, Morgan.

01:03:33.775 --> 01:03:36.369
Ma'am! You cannot
let your dog do that here!

01:04:05.974 --> 01:04:07.908
You're too late.

01:04:09.277 --> 01:04:10.835
My apologies.

01:04:38.106 --> 01:04:40.574
Oh, Giselle!

01:04:49.351 --> 01:04:51.785
Look, uh, Giselle.

01:04:51.853 --> 01:04:55.311
That was a nice story about
your chipmunk friend and all.

01:04:55.390 --> 01:04:57.517
Yes.

01:04:57.592 --> 01:05:00.561
I know what it's like
when someone disappoints you.

01:05:00.629 --> 01:05:02.824
It's tempting to see things
the way you wish

01:05:02.898 --> 01:05:06.061
- instead of how they are.
- I don't wish that he's coming, Robert.

01:05:06.134 --> 01:05:07.123
He is.

01:05:07.202 --> 01:05:09.693
Right.
Because the chipmunk told you.

01:05:09.771 --> 01:05:11.898
Yes. Pip actually said...

01:05:11.973 --> 01:05:14.066
Know what? I don't
know if you're kidding

01:05:14.142 --> 01:05:17.509
or being ironic,
because chipmunks don't talk.

01:05:17.579 --> 01:05:19.171
Well, not here they don't.

01:05:19.247 --> 01:05:21.807
So in lieu of taking advice
from a forest rodent,

01:05:21.883 --> 01:05:24.078
I just wanted to say that, uh...

01:05:24.152 --> 01:05:27.519
...if it did work out and you
decided to stay in New York,

01:05:27.589 --> 01:05:31.116
- I'd like to help.
- That's very kind of you, Robert.

01:05:31.193 --> 01:05:33.923
- But Edward is coming for me.
- But what if he doesn't?

01:05:33.995 --> 01:05:35.724
Why do you keep saying that?

01:05:35.797 --> 01:05:38.061
Because I deal with this every day.

01:05:38.133 --> 01:05:40.727
If a relationship
has issues at the beginning,

01:05:40.802 --> 01:05:43.828
- it doesn't get any better.
- He is coming!

01:05:43.905 --> 01:05:47.033
Giselle, I don't think so. No.

01:05:47.109 --> 01:05:50.272
- Yes!
- I have to disagree. No.

01:05:50.345 --> 01:05:51.937
- No?
- No.

01:05:52.013 --> 01:05:55.346
Is that the only word that you know? No?

01:05:55.417 --> 01:05:57.977
- No!
- Oh, yeah? No.

01:05:58.053 --> 01:06:02.956
- No. I mean, no.
- No! No! Over and over again!

01:06:03.024 --> 01:06:06.653
Every word out of your mouth
is "no"! It makes me so...

01:06:06.728 --> 01:06:09.356
- Sometimes you make me so...
- I make you so what?

01:06:09.431 --> 01:06:11.228
You make me so...

01:06:11.299 --> 01:06:12.823
So...

01:06:14.436 --> 01:06:17.769
...angry!

01:06:17.839 --> 01:06:21.002
- I'm angry!
- Are you all right?

01:06:21.076 --> 01:06:25.843
- I'm angry. I'm angry!
- Are you OK?

01:06:25.914 --> 01:06:27.211
I'm...

01:06:28.750 --> 01:06:30.775
I'm wonderful.

01:06:33.955 --> 01:06:35.718
Are you sure?

01:06:36.892 --> 01:06:38.826
Yes. I'm...

01:06:40.529 --> 01:06:42.326
I'm fine.

01:06:46.034 --> 01:06:47.831
I'm...

01:06:47.903 --> 01:06:49.700
...fit as a fiddle.

01:06:55.911 --> 01:06:57.674
OK.

01:07:02.150 --> 01:07:03.583
Good night.

01:07:16.198 --> 01:07:17.927
Oh, my.

01:08:02.244 --> 01:08:04.303
- Good morning.
- Morning, Daddy.

01:08:04.379 --> 01:08:06.210
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:08:06.281 --> 01:08:10.217
Morning. Made breakfast.
Great.

01:08:10.285 --> 01:08:11.912
I'll get it.

01:08:11.987 --> 01:08:13.284
Thank you.

01:08:14.723 --> 01:08:17.988
- That's a nice dress.
- Thank you.

01:08:18.059 --> 01:08:20.323
It is I! Prince Edward of Andalasia,

01:08:20.395 --> 01:08:23.023
come to rescue my lovely bride,
the fair Giselle!

01:08:23.098 --> 01:08:25.032
- He's here.
- Apparently.

01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:27.660
Oh, my. Oh, my goodness.

01:08:27.736 --> 01:08:32.264
- Oh, um, how do I look?
- Slightly stunned.

01:08:32.340 --> 01:08:36.674
- No. I mean, how do I look?
- You look...

01:08:37.645 --> 01:08:38.874
...beautiful.

01:08:40.916 --> 01:08:44.943
- Giselle!
- Edward!

01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:48.888
Ah!

01:08:50.658 --> 01:08:53.127
Could you...? I'm sorry.
But could you just be...?

01:08:53.194 --> 01:08:55.719
- Could you just be careful?
- You!

01:08:55.796 --> 01:08:57.992
- What?
- You're the one who's been

01:08:58.066 --> 01:09:00.694
- holding my Giselle captive!
- Let's stay calm.

01:09:00.769 --> 01:09:01.962
No!

01:09:02.037 --> 01:09:06.269
- Any last words before I dispatch you?
- You have got to be kidding me.

01:09:06.341 --> 01:09:07.865
Strange words.

01:09:07.943 --> 01:09:11.743
No! No! No.

01:09:11.813 --> 01:09:14.042
- These are my friends.
- Oh.

01:09:14.115 --> 01:09:16.606
This is Morgan.
And Robert.

01:09:16.685 --> 01:09:18.084
This is Edward.

01:09:18.153 --> 01:09:21.816
<i># I've been dreaming
of a true love's kiss</i>

01:09:21.890 --> 01:09:23.152
He sings too.

01:09:23.224 --> 01:09:27.354
<i># And a miss
I have begun to miss</i>

01:09:27.429 --> 01:09:31.091
<i># Pure and sweet
waiting to complete</i>

01:09:31.166 --> 01:09:35.033
<i># My love song</i>

01:09:35.103 --> 01:09:39.335
<i># Yes, somewhere there's
a maid I've never met</i>

01:09:39.407 --> 01:09:41.841
<i># Who was made</i>

01:09:43.578 --> 01:09:45.205
<i># Who was made</i>

01:09:47.983 --> 01:09:49.575
<i># To finish #</i>

01:09:49.651 --> 01:09:53.484
- What's wrong?
- You're not singing.

01:09:53.555 --> 01:09:57.218
Oh. I'm not.

01:09:58.593 --> 01:10:00.390
Well, I'm sorry.

01:10:00.462 --> 01:10:02.953
- I was thinking.
- Thinking?

01:10:03.031 --> 01:10:06.000
Before we leave, there's one
thing I would love to do.

01:10:06.067 --> 01:10:08.661
Name it, my love,
and it is done.

01:10:08.737 --> 01:10:12.571
- I want to go on a date.
- A date!

01:10:14.376 --> 01:10:15.570
What's a date?

01:10:16.845 --> 01:10:18.244
Well...

01:10:19.614 --> 01:10:21.980
...we go out to dinner.

01:10:22.050 --> 01:10:24.245
And we talk about ourselves.

01:10:24.319 --> 01:10:28.847
Our likes and our dislikes.
Our interests.

01:10:28.923 --> 01:10:30.788
A date.

01:10:35.096 --> 01:10:38.532
And remember that you guys can come
and visit Andalasia anytime.

01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:40.659
Sure. And if you ever come to town,

01:10:40.735 --> 01:10:43.329
we should all get together for dinner.

01:10:43.405 --> 01:10:45.134
That would be lovely.

01:10:48.476 --> 01:10:50.603
We'll see each other soon.

01:10:50.678 --> 01:10:53.579
It's not like we're talking
about, you know,

01:10:53.648 --> 01:10:56.776
- forever.
- And ever.

01:10:57.786 --> 01:10:59.686
So, uh...

01:11:02.724 --> 01:11:04.282
...good luck on your date.

01:11:05.994 --> 01:11:09.521
Oh, and you with Nancy.

01:11:12.867 --> 01:11:17.634
And you. It was so nice
spending time with you.

01:11:20.742 --> 01:11:23.802
I'll never forget you.
You know that.

01:11:26.147 --> 01:11:27.307
Yeah?

01:11:29.751 --> 01:11:33.084
Thank you for taking care
of my bride, peasants.

01:11:40.428 --> 01:11:42.953
I'm going to really miss her.

01:11:44.332 --> 01:11:45.526
Me, too, sweetheart.

01:11:49.637 --> 01:11:51.002
Me too.

01:12:01.416 --> 01:12:05.352
I don't know how they found
each other, Your Majesty.

01:12:05.420 --> 01:12:07.445
- I really don't.
- You idiot!

01:12:07.522 --> 01:12:11.652
- But, Your Majesty...
- I sent you to kill her, not save her.

01:12:11.726 --> 01:12:16.220
- Can't you get that straight?
- I realize you're upset, madam.

01:12:16.297 --> 01:12:18.959
But if you could find a way
to give me one more chance.

01:12:19.033 --> 01:12:21.866
Another chance? Do you think
poison apples grow on trees?

01:12:21.936 --> 01:12:25.838
There's only one left!
You are out of chances!

01:12:25.907 --> 01:12:28.102
- But, Your Majesty, please!
- No, forget it!

01:12:28.176 --> 01:12:33.341
I'm coming there! And I will
kill the little wretch myself!

01:12:33.414 --> 01:12:35.473
Oh, pooh.

01:12:45.894 --> 01:12:45.994
I was just thinking about what that girl
said about Phoebe's eyes sparkling.

01:12:45.994 --> 01:12:51.489
I was just thinking about what that girl
said about Phoebe's eyes sparkling.

01:12:51.566 --> 01:12:55.366
I mean, it's the first thing
I noticed when we met.

01:12:55.436 --> 01:12:57.199
- It's true.
- Mm.

01:12:57.272 --> 01:13:01.709
- Her eyes really do sparkle.
- Ethan.

01:13:01.776 --> 01:13:03.403
OK, look. Look.

01:13:03.478 --> 01:13:06.208
As your attorney, Phoebe,

01:13:06.281 --> 01:13:09.250
you can't let a chance encounter
with someone...

01:13:09.317 --> 01:13:10.545
What if it wasn't chance?

01:13:10.618 --> 01:13:13.109
What if it was no accident,
us meeting her.

01:13:13.188 --> 01:13:16.453
- You guys had problems.
- Everybody has problems.

01:13:16.524 --> 01:13:18.253
Everybody has bad times.

01:13:18.326 --> 01:13:22.126
Do we sacrifice all of the good
times because of them?

01:13:22.197 --> 01:13:23.858
No.

01:13:39.914 --> 01:13:42.849
How did you like your hot dog?

01:13:42.917 --> 01:13:46.785
Oh! It's not really a dog. They just
call it a hot dog here.

01:13:49.357 --> 01:13:53.123
- It's quite excellent.
- Good.

01:13:53.194 --> 01:13:57.062
Well! This has been a splendid date.

01:13:57.131 --> 01:14:00.191
- Shall we go?
- Go where?

01:14:00.268 --> 01:14:02.828
Back to Andalasia, of course.
To be married.

01:14:02.904 --> 01:14:05.429
To live happily ever after
forever and ever.

01:14:05.506 --> 01:14:10.500
Oh. Well, we don't have
to go right away.

01:14:13.181 --> 01:14:16.150
How long do these dates usually last?

01:14:16.217 --> 01:14:17.878
Oh, well...

01:14:17.952 --> 01:14:21.319
They can go as long as you want, really.

01:14:21.389 --> 01:14:23.516
They can just keep going and going,

01:14:23.591 --> 01:14:26.788
just so long as you keep thinking
about activities that you can do.

01:14:26.861 --> 01:14:29.728
- Activities?
- We could go to the museum.

01:14:29.797 --> 01:14:33.324
Or to the theater?

01:14:33.401 --> 01:14:37.098
- Or there's this ball.
- A ball?

01:14:37.171 --> 01:14:38.832
Yes.

01:14:38.906 --> 01:14:40.965
There's dancing and music.

01:14:41.042 --> 01:14:43.602
- You like that.
- Well, I suppose.

01:14:43.678 --> 01:14:45.475
Oh, wonderful.
We should go then.

01:14:45.546 --> 01:14:48.174
- Giselle?
- Yes?

01:14:48.249 --> 01:14:52.777
- And then home to Andalasia?
- Of course.

01:14:52.854 --> 01:14:54.617
The moment it's over.

01:14:58.526 --> 01:15:01.051
Giselle! You're back!
You're back!

01:15:01.129 --> 01:15:04.997
Oh, Morgan. Oh!
Morgan, I need your help.

01:15:05.066 --> 01:15:09.025
I'm going to the ball, and I'm not sure
what to do, or what I should wear.

01:15:09.103 --> 01:15:12.072
I don't know where to find
a fairy godmother at this late hour.

01:15:12.140 --> 01:15:15.871
I have something better
than a fairy godmother.

01:15:18.246 --> 01:15:21.579
Daddy says it's only for emergencies.

01:15:21.649 --> 01:15:24.482
This is definitely an emergency.

01:15:35.496 --> 01:15:37.828
Here you go,
you get to carry the bag.

01:15:37.899 --> 01:15:40.595
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:15:40.668 --> 01:15:42.192
Next.

01:15:52.914 --> 01:15:56.611
- Miss?
- Oh. Thank you.

01:15:56.684 --> 01:15:58.174
Have a good day.

01:16:01.889 --> 01:16:05.256
And when you go out, you don't
want to wear too much makeup.

01:16:05.326 --> 01:16:07.817
'Cause otherwise
the boys get the wrong idea.

01:16:07.895 --> 01:16:10.659
And you know how they are.

01:16:10.732 --> 01:16:13.064
They're only after one thing.

01:16:13.134 --> 01:16:16.228
- What's that?
- I don't know.

01:16:16.304 --> 01:16:17.737
Nobody will tell me.

01:16:18.539 --> 01:16:19.870
Oh.

01:16:19.941 --> 01:16:24.037
So is this what it's like?

01:16:24.112 --> 01:16:27.047
- What, sweetie?
- Going shopping with your mother?

01:16:27.115 --> 01:16:30.812
Oh, I don't know. I've never
been shopping with my mother.

01:16:30.885 --> 01:16:32.853
Me either.

01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:35.855
- But I like it.
- Me too.

01:16:35.923 --> 01:16:39.256
And just think.
Soon, you'll have a new mother.

01:16:39.327 --> 01:16:41.318
You mean stepmother.

01:16:41.396 --> 01:16:43.694
It's not true what they say.

01:16:43.765 --> 01:16:47.599
I have met so many kind
and wonderful stepmothers.

01:16:47.668 --> 01:16:50.000
Edward has a stepmother.

01:16:50.071 --> 01:16:53.529
I've never met her,
but I hear she's just lovely.

01:17:30.778 --> 01:17:35.511
<i>Mr. N is on the line telling us
his sweetie pie is acting distant.</i>

01:17:35.583 --> 01:17:37.016
<i>You were saying, Mr. N?</i>

01:17:37.084 --> 01:17:39.450
I've always treated her like a queen,

01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:42.353
but lately I'm starting to feel

01:17:42.423 --> 01:17:46.154
there's this whole other side to her,
like I don't even know her anymore.

01:17:47.829 --> 01:17:49.820
<i>I think you need
to take her aside</i>

01:17:49.897 --> 01:17:54.664
<i>and find out how she
really feels about you.</i>

01:17:54.735 --> 01:17:57.898
Hello, worthless.
Miss me?

01:18:00.374 --> 01:18:05.903
Reperio lemma miha!

01:18:19.227 --> 01:18:20.626
A-ha!

01:19:16.250 --> 01:19:19.219
- What is she doing here?
- I have no idea.

01:19:21.355 --> 01:19:23.789
- I'm surprised to see you here.
- I'm surprised.

01:19:23.858 --> 01:19:26.349
- You said you couldn't dance.
- I said I didn't.

01:19:26.427 --> 01:19:29.362
I never said I couldn't.

01:19:30.464 --> 01:19:33.900
Oh. This is Edward.
He's my, um...

01:19:35.336 --> 01:19:37.736
...prince.
- And this is Nancy.

01:19:37.805 --> 01:19:39.830
She's... Well, she's...

01:19:39.907 --> 01:19:41.135
- We're together.
- Yes.

01:19:42.577 --> 01:19:46.775
And this beautiful lady is
Giselle, the love of my life.

01:19:46.847 --> 01:19:50.544
- My heart's true desire.
- Wow.

01:19:50.618 --> 01:19:53.587
- Is something wrong?
- Just the way you said that.

01:19:53.654 --> 01:19:56.782
So straightforward.
Not a hint of irony.

01:19:56.857 --> 01:19:59.951
It's very... romantic.

01:20:00.027 --> 01:20:01.756
Well, thank you.

01:20:01.829 --> 01:20:04.491
Well, folks,
it's that time of night.

01:20:04.565 --> 01:20:07.966
I'd like to ask each gentleman
to invite a lady

01:20:08.035 --> 01:20:13.837
he did not accompany this evening
to dance the King and Queen's Waltz.

01:20:16.978 --> 01:20:20.880
- May I have the pleasure?
- Please.

01:20:31.559 --> 01:20:33.186
Shall we?

01:20:36.130 --> 01:20:40.191
<i># You're in my arms</i>

01:20:40.267 --> 01:20:43.566
<i># And all the world is gone</i>

01:20:43.638 --> 01:20:46.971
<i># The music playing on</i>

01:20:47.041 --> 01:20:50.340
<i># For only two</i>

01:20:51.278 --> 01:20:55.772
<i># So close together</i>

01:20:55.850 --> 01:20:58.148
<i># And when I'm with you</i>

01:20:58.219 --> 01:21:03.885
<i># So close to feeling alive</i>

01:21:06.794 --> 01:21:10.594
<i># A life goes by</i>

01:21:10.665 --> 01:21:13.964
<i># Romantic dreams must die</i>

01:21:14.035 --> 01:21:17.596
<i># So I bid mine goodbye</i>

01:21:17.672 --> 01:21:22.166
<i># And never knew</i>

01:21:22.243 --> 01:21:26.179
<i># So close was waiting</i>

01:21:26.247 --> 01:21:28.807
<i># Waiting here with you</i>

01:21:28.883 --> 01:21:34.116
<i># And now forever I know</i>

01:21:35.756 --> 01:21:39.089
<i># All that I want is</i>

01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:42.857
<i># To hold you</i>

01:21:42.930 --> 01:21:45.831
<i># So close</i>

01:21:45.900 --> 01:21:49.768
<i># So close to reaching</i>

01:21:49.837 --> 01:21:52.203
<i># That famous happy ending</i>

01:21:52.273 --> 01:21:56.607
<i># Almost believing</i>

01:21:56.677 --> 01:21:59.441
<i># This one's not pretend</i>

01:21:59.513 --> 01:22:03.244
<i># Now you're beside me</i>

01:22:03.317 --> 01:22:08.311
<i># And look how far we've come</i>

01:22:08.389 --> 01:22:11.290
<i># So far</i>

01:22:11.358 --> 01:22:14.623
<i># We are</i>

01:22:14.695 --> 01:22:19.598
<i># So close</i>

01:22:54.401 --> 01:22:55.959
Mind if I cut in?

01:22:58.572 --> 01:23:00.233
No, of course.

01:23:00.307 --> 01:23:05.973
<i># If I should lose you now</i>

01:23:07.481 --> 01:23:11.212
<i># We're so close</i>

01:23:11.285 --> 01:23:13.276
<i># To reaching</i>

01:23:13.354 --> 01:23:15.845
<i># That famous happy ending</i>

01:23:15.923 --> 01:23:19.984
<i># Almost believing</i>

01:23:20.060 --> 01:23:23.826
<i># This one's not pretend</i>

01:23:23.898 --> 01:23:27.561
- You're sad.
- Oh, no.

01:23:27.635 --> 01:23:31.594
- I'm fine.
- I'll get your wrap.

01:23:35.476 --> 01:23:39.742
<i># So close</i>

01:23:39.814 --> 01:23:42.476
<i># So close</i>

01:23:42.550 --> 01:23:48.250
<i># And still so far #</i>

01:24:08.843 --> 01:24:12.370
Child.

01:24:12.446 --> 01:24:15.779
You! You sent me here.

01:24:15.850 --> 01:24:20.082
I'm so glad to see you.
I was so very worried.

01:24:20.154 --> 01:24:24.022
What a terrible accident that brought
you to this terrible place

01:24:24.091 --> 01:24:29.620
with so much sadness
and so much pain.

01:24:29.697 --> 01:24:32.723
Oh, yes.

01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:36.793
To never be with the one you love.

01:24:36.871 --> 01:24:39.897
Doomed to be with another

01:24:39.974 --> 01:24:42.204
for eternity.

01:24:42.276 --> 01:24:45.609
Oh! But it doesn't have to be that way.

01:24:45.679 --> 01:24:49.547
Oh, no, no, no.
I can stop the hurt. Yes.

01:24:49.617 --> 01:24:54.554
I can make all those
bad memories disappear.

01:24:55.823 --> 01:24:58.621
Yes!

01:24:58.692 --> 01:25:02.389
Just one bite, my love,

01:25:02.463 --> 01:25:06.422
and all this will go away.

01:25:07.835 --> 01:25:10.167
Your life here,

01:25:10.237 --> 01:25:12.671
the people that you met.

01:25:12.740 --> 01:25:16.335
You won't remember anything.

01:25:17.444 --> 01:25:19.935
Just sweet dreams...

01:25:21.282 --> 01:25:23.910
...and happy endings.

01:25:34.461 --> 01:25:38.261
But you must hurry. You must hurry.
The magic will not work

01:25:38.332 --> 01:25:42.928
unless you take a bite
before the clock strikes 12.

01:25:43.003 --> 01:25:45.870
Hurry now. Hurry. Hurry.

01:25:45.940 --> 01:25:48.534
Yes! Yes! Yes!
That's it. That's it.

01:25:48.609 --> 01:25:51.169
Hurry. Hurry. Yes.

01:26:21.208 --> 01:26:23.506
Out of my way!

01:26:27.181 --> 01:26:28.648
How did she do that?

01:26:36.056 --> 01:26:40.015
Speciosus, formosus,

01:26:40.094 --> 01:26:42.722
praeclarus!

01:26:44.164 --> 01:26:46.462
- Ah!
- Edward?

01:26:46.533 --> 01:26:49.502
- Mother?
- Edward!

01:26:51.772 --> 01:26:53.797
Yes. Oh, her.

01:26:53.874 --> 01:26:55.774
I was taking her out for fresh air.

01:26:55.843 --> 01:26:58.505
She seems to have swooned.
Oh, leave her, darling.

01:26:58.579 --> 01:27:01.343
I think she's fine.
Just leave her. Slap her.

01:27:01.415 --> 01:27:03.383
Give her some water.
She's fine.

01:27:03.450 --> 01:27:06.749
- Someone help me, please!
- You're overreacting.

01:27:06.820 --> 01:27:08.811
You needn't get so upset, dear.
Really.

01:27:08.889 --> 01:27:12.655
Oh, no. Call 9-1-1.

01:27:12.726 --> 01:27:15.286
Don't pay any attention.
Go back to your party.

01:27:15.362 --> 01:27:17.922
- She's fine.
- Giselle.

01:27:20.467 --> 01:27:23.231
Hello, we have a woman
here, she's unconscious.

01:27:23.303 --> 01:27:25.066
I didn't see what happened.

01:27:25.139 --> 01:27:28.404
- She fainted. But she'll be fine...
- No, she didn't.

01:27:28.475 --> 01:27:31.842
Nathaniel, go back to the car.

01:27:31.912 --> 01:27:33.573
I will not.

01:27:35.249 --> 01:27:38.412
You poisoned her.

01:27:38.485 --> 01:27:40.544
- She's the evil hag, sire!
- You did this?

01:27:40.621 --> 01:27:45.149
She sent the girl here.
She poisoned her! With my help,

01:27:45.225 --> 01:27:48.752
- I regret to say.
- Oh, he's lying, darling.

01:27:48.829 --> 01:27:52.663
Why would I ever align myself with that
buffoon? I mean, think about it. Why...?

01:27:52.733 --> 01:27:57.693
Silence!
You lying, murderous wretch!

01:27:57.771 --> 01:28:00.740
When we return home, Andalasia
shall know of your treachery.

01:28:00.808 --> 01:28:05.438
- Your days as queen will be over!
- Take my crown?

01:28:05.512 --> 01:28:08.379
Don't you think that's
a bit melodramatic, dear?

01:28:08.449 --> 01:28:10.644
I don't know
what "melodramatic" means,

01:28:10.717 --> 01:28:13.914
but you'll be removed from the throne,
Narissa. I will see to it.

01:28:24.932 --> 01:28:28.368
That's enough from you, you viper.

01:28:28.435 --> 01:28:31.632
- We have to help her. What can we do?
- I don't know. What do we do?

01:28:31.705 --> 01:28:34.697
There's no way of helping her.
She's done for.

01:28:39.179 --> 01:28:40.305
True love's kiss.

01:28:42.182 --> 01:28:43.774
What?

01:28:43.851 --> 01:28:46.081
It's the most powerful thing
in the world.

01:28:46.153 --> 01:28:47.677
Yes. Yes, of course.

01:28:52.526 --> 01:28:54.084
I knew that.

01:29:09.476 --> 01:29:11.774
It's not working!

01:29:15.215 --> 01:29:18.810
You'll never save her now.
When the clock strikes 12...

01:29:19.953 --> 01:29:21.045
...she'll be dead.

01:29:23.390 --> 01:29:25.415
- Unless...
- Unless?

01:29:27.828 --> 01:29:30.661
It's not possible.
It couldn't be me.

01:29:30.731 --> 01:29:33.291
- Don't you see?
- I've only known her for a few days.

01:29:33.367 --> 01:29:36.530
Kiss her, Robert. It's OK.

01:29:46.847 --> 01:29:48.371
Please.

01:29:49.416 --> 01:29:51.213
Don't leave me.

01:30:20.280 --> 01:30:22.043
I knew it was you.

01:30:32.459 --> 01:30:34.859
- What did you think?
- Wonderful.

01:30:34.928 --> 01:30:37.158
Oh, much better
than last year's show.

01:30:37.231 --> 01:30:40.894
No!

01:30:44.605 --> 01:30:48.564
The most powerful thing
in the world.

01:30:48.642 --> 01:30:52.840
Ha! I don't think so.

01:30:52.913 --> 01:30:57.282
You have no idea
who you're dealing with.

01:30:57.351 --> 01:31:01.788
You want a show?
I'll give you a show.

01:31:01.855 --> 01:31:05.086
Back up and get ready
for the main event!

01:31:05.158 --> 01:31:08.127
- You selfish, evil...
- Speciosus,

01:31:08.195 --> 01:31:11.824
formosus, praeclarus!

01:31:24.544 --> 01:31:29.106
All this nauseating talk of
"true love's kiss."

01:31:29.182 --> 01:31:31.776
It really does bring out
the worst in me.

01:31:31.852 --> 01:31:34.343
- Stay back.
- You know, I've been thinking.

01:31:34.421 --> 01:31:37.356
If I'm going to remain queen,
I'm going to need

01:31:37.424 --> 01:31:40.951
some sort of story
when I go back. Hmm.

01:31:41.028 --> 01:31:45.761
What if a giant,
vicious beast showed up

01:31:45.832 --> 01:31:48.426
and killed everyone?

01:31:48.502 --> 01:31:52.165
And poor, defenseless
Queen Narissa,

01:31:52.239 --> 01:31:54.503
she just couldn't save them.

01:31:54.574 --> 01:31:59.238
Let's begin with the girl
who started it all, shall we?

01:31:59.313 --> 01:32:03.044
- Over my dead body.
- All right.

01:32:03.116 --> 01:32:06.813
- I'm flexible.
- Let me go!

01:32:08.922 --> 01:32:13.256
Come along, Giselle. I don't
want you to miss this ending.

01:32:32.779 --> 01:32:35.213
Let me go!

01:32:35.282 --> 01:32:38.479
Ah! Put me down!
You're crazy!

01:32:38.552 --> 01:32:42.113
No, spiteful, vindictive, very large.

01:32:42.189 --> 01:32:45.352
But never crazy. Ah!

01:32:47.227 --> 01:32:51.061
- Giselle!
- Oh, my. This is a twist on our story!

01:32:51.131 --> 01:32:55.261
It's the brave little princess
coming to the rescue.

01:32:55.335 --> 01:32:59.237
I guess that makes you the damsel
in distress, huh, handsome?

01:32:59.306 --> 01:33:04.505
Keep up with me, dear. It's time
to take our tale to new heights!

01:33:24.564 --> 01:33:26.088
Pip!

01:33:29.469 --> 01:33:32.165
You'd like to finally be released...

01:33:32.239 --> 01:33:33.900
...to help Giselle...

01:33:33.974 --> 01:33:36.238
...to best the beast.

01:33:36.309 --> 01:33:38.277
Why didn't you say so
in the first place?

01:33:40.881 --> 01:33:42.007
Thank you.

01:33:43.850 --> 01:33:47.286
Narissa! I'm not going
to let you take him!

01:33:47.354 --> 01:33:50.846
We're coming to the end
of our story now.

01:33:50.924 --> 01:33:53.085
Are you at the edge
of your seat, Giselle,

01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:56.823
just dying to know how it ends?

01:33:56.897 --> 01:33:58.762
Pip!

01:34:03.703 --> 01:34:05.534
How about this:

01:34:05.605 --> 01:34:10.269
"And they all lived
happily ever after!"

01:34:10.343 --> 01:34:15.371
Well, at least I did.

01:34:21.822 --> 01:34:23.380
What?

01:34:34.501 --> 01:34:37.265
Oh. Ah!

01:34:37.337 --> 01:34:41.501
Ow! Ah!

01:34:56.957 --> 01:34:58.925
Robert! Hold on!

01:35:01.862 --> 01:35:04.831
Ah!

01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:30.681
Is this a habit of yours?
Falling off of stuff?

01:35:30.757 --> 01:35:34.249
Only when you're around
to catch me.

01:36:07.627 --> 01:36:11.859
<i># Ever ever after</i>

01:36:17.904 --> 01:36:22.864
- Why so sad, beautiful lady?
- She forgot her shoe.

01:36:22.943 --> 01:36:24.308
Figures.

01:36:26.613 --> 01:36:32.381
<i># Storybook endings

<i># Deep down inside we wanna

01:36:40.694 --> 01:36:41.888
It's a perfect fit.

Oops! I'm so sorry.

01:37:18.198 --> 01:37:21.167
Wow, really
good reception here.

01:37:23.403 --> 01:37:25.633
