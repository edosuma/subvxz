01:31.438 --> 01:34.134
-Run for it!
-Come on, Lisa! Go, go, go!

01:34.307 --> 01:36.332
Go for second!

01:42.416 --> 01:44.350
lt's gonna be close.

01:45.285 --> 01:47.583
Yeah, Lisa!

01:47.754 --> 01:49.312
United States wins gold!

01:51.725 --> 01:53.556
You did it!

01:55.395 --> 01:57.329
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

01:57.497 --> 01:59.362
Yeah, Lisa!

01:59.599 --> 02:02.796
So basically we're down to
three choices for the last slot.

02:02.969 --> 02:06.029
Lisa's here to see you.
l'm glad you're meeting with her...

02:06.206 --> 02:09.902
...because when it comes to this girl,
the intangibles are everything.

02:10.076 --> 02:12.203
She's been the heartbeat
of this program.

02:12.379 --> 02:14.074
Just let me think for a second.

02:14.247 --> 02:17.375
She did the Olympics and
two championships without an error.

02:17.551 --> 02:19.883
-She practices, what?
-Three hours every day.

02:20.053 --> 02:22.521
She makes everyone better. Coach?

02:23.156 --> 02:25.624
l have the benefit of being new here.

02:25.959 --> 02:28.018
Lisa is 31 .

02:28.195 --> 02:30.925
She's 0.3 seconds slower
moving towards first.

02:31.097 --> 02:35.693
l'm tired of justifying myself because
you're hung up on her as a role model.

02:35.869 --> 02:38.895
Nobody's gonna change his mind.
lt's over.

02:39.072 --> 02:41.336
-What's that?
-lt's your call.

02:41.708 --> 02:43.471
Hooray! Thank you. Thank you.

02:43.643 --> 02:46.874
At least let her know today.
She'll have to redirect her life.

02:47.047 --> 02:50.210
Everyone finds out when
l post it online. No exceptions.

02:50.383 --> 02:52.180
Because we field women athletes...

02:52.352 --> 02:55.287
...doesn't mean we get girly
when someone's time is up.

02:55.455 --> 02:56.479
Holy crap.

02:57.357 --> 02:58.517
l beg your pardon?

02:59.659 --> 03:01.354
l'm sorry.

03:01.895 --> 03:03.795
Oh, my Lord.
What is to become of me?

03:03.964 --> 03:07.229
l've lost my ability
to smile at bastards.

03:11.104 --> 03:12.799
Still got it.

03:14.341 --> 03:15.365
Can we...?

03:15.542 --> 03:20.002
-l can't see her. Tell her l'm too busy.
-How's it going?

03:21.915 --> 03:23.177
Three, three, three!

03:27.787 --> 03:29.755
Let's go, people!

03:29.923 --> 03:33.051
-Faster!
-Good stretch, Smalls!

03:34.261 --> 03:36.661
-Go, baby! Attaway!
-Right here!

03:36.830 --> 03:38.388
Faster!

03:40.634 --> 03:43.034
-Hey, whose phone?
-Al right, look up.

03:44.337 --> 03:45.361
Oh, man.

03:45.539 --> 03:47.632
-Smalls, are you okay?
-Yeah.

03:48.508 --> 03:49.998
This better be worth it.

03:50.176 --> 03:52.644
-You gotta watch out.
-Yeah.

03:53.780 --> 03:55.145
<i>-Hello?
-Hi.</i>

03:55.315 --> 03:57.306
This is George Madison.

03:57.484 --> 04:01.716
l think you might know that Riva
gave me your phone number.

04:02.889 --> 04:04.686
No.

04:04.858 --> 04:07.622
She thought it might be a good idea
if we had dinner.

04:07.794 --> 04:09.955
l'll call her.
When did you have in mind?

04:10.263 --> 04:12.823
No, l wasn't calling to set a time.

04:12.999 --> 04:15.490
<i>She didn't know that
l was seeing someone.</i>

04:15.835 --> 04:19.168
Well, she didn't know
that it had escalated a bit.

04:19.339 --> 04:21.432
At least on my part.

04:22.442 --> 04:24.273
lt just added up for me suddenly.

04:24.778 --> 04:26.746
So you're calling me to break up?

04:27.581 --> 04:30.641
-You can't just walk in there.
-No, l just didn't think....

04:31.017 --> 04:32.041
George Madison.

04:32.218 --> 04:35.085
l'm sorry. l got distracted.
What was l saying?

04:35.422 --> 04:37.913
You were saying
you just didn't think.

04:38.491 --> 04:40.857
Right, right. Thank you.

04:41.127 --> 04:43.254
-Thank you.
-Welcome.

04:44.531 --> 04:45.691
Thank you for holding.

04:46.433 --> 04:49.163
<i>l just didn't think it was right
not to phone you...</i>

04:49.436 --> 04:53.668
...once l took your number, in case you
had talked and were expecting my call.

04:53.840 --> 04:58.106
Okay. Well, it was nice of you to call,
in a way, l guess.

04:58.345 --> 04:59.778
Right.

05:01.014 --> 05:02.982
Sorry for interrupting your day.

05:03.149 --> 05:04.446
<i>-Yeah.
-Goodbye.</i>

05:04.618 --> 05:05.676
Bye.

05:05.852 --> 05:08.787
Weirdo. l'm gonna kill Riva. Let's go.

05:08.955 --> 05:11.082
All right, ladies, let's go!

05:20.533 --> 05:22.524
Oh, my God.

05:24.037 --> 05:27.063
-So you gave my number to a guy?
-Yeah.

05:27.240 --> 05:30.732
l hardly know him, but he went
to business school with my brother.

05:30.910 --> 05:32.673
So why did you give him
my number?

05:33.246 --> 05:35.043
You don't remember
Wednesday night?

05:36.016 --> 05:39.179
You said you had never dated
a non-athlete.

05:39.352 --> 05:42.014
''l should date a non-athlete,
right, Riva?''

05:42.188 --> 05:43.416
That's what you said.

05:43.590 --> 05:46.058
Don't listen to me when
l'm drinking Guinness.

05:46.426 --> 05:48.656
lt's the only time you really say stuff.

05:48.828 --> 05:50.955
l hope that's not true.

05:52.132 --> 05:55.761
This exercise is for next time, okay?
Thank you.

05:59.406 --> 06:00.873
George.

06:01.741 --> 06:03.800
Didn't l say l was crashing
on my book?

06:03.977 --> 06:06.343
Yeah, you did. l'm not gonna stay.

06:06.513 --> 06:08.447
Maybe that's better for tonight.

06:09.616 --> 06:15.077
Look, if you're concerned about us
now that we've intensified...

06:15.255 --> 06:17.246
...we're okay. l am busy...

06:18.058 --> 06:21.459
...so l can't demonstrate to you
we're okay in the little ways...

06:21.628 --> 06:24.256
...like paying attention to you...

06:24.431 --> 06:29.368
...but if you could take my word for it
until work lets up, that would help me.

06:29.536 --> 06:30.594
And us.

06:32.338 --> 06:34.636
l think l like that word better.

06:36.276 --> 06:37.368
Us.

06:38.178 --> 06:39.941
T-- Today l....

06:42.882 --> 06:46.545
lt was nice just to see your face
for a minute. lt settles me down.

06:47.554 --> 06:50.045
Great game last night, Matty.
Who's your date?

06:50.223 --> 06:51.485
You're the best pitcher.

06:51.658 --> 06:53.626
-Can l get your autograph?
-Got a pen?

06:53.793 --> 06:56.819
-He's the cutest pitcher in baseball.
-Rocking that mound!

06:56.996 --> 06:59.590
Hold on, hold on.
You guys ready? Okay.

06:59.766 --> 07:02.166
-Here, one more over here.
-Lisa!

07:02.836 --> 07:06.328
-To the right!
-The right.

07:08.541 --> 07:11.442
-Thanks for everything.
-You're awesome!

07:16.116 --> 07:18.846
The night is so great.
You look so good.

07:19.018 --> 07:22.112
Just needed to grab you.
We're here.

07:22.288 --> 07:24.347
-Good evening, Mr. Reynolds.
-Tom.

07:24.524 --> 07:27.459
Matty, l might have to
go back on what l said...

07:27.627 --> 07:29.857
...about finally seeing
your place tonight.

07:30.029 --> 07:31.860
l just have a lot on my mind.

07:32.365 --> 07:33.457
Okay, are you sure?

07:34.300 --> 07:35.528
Well...

07:35.969 --> 07:37.027
...no.

07:37.203 --> 07:39.637
There's no pressure.
lt should feel right.

07:39.806 --> 07:40.864
That's nice.

07:41.775 --> 07:43.106
Thanks.

07:44.110 --> 07:45.702
Why are you moving away?

07:46.246 --> 07:48.510
l wanna give you room
to think and decide.

08:05.698 --> 08:07.689
You have all the signs of a handful.

08:07.867 --> 08:09.732
l hope so.

08:10.336 --> 08:12.634
You better hang on to that energy.

08:27.520 --> 08:31.081
Wait till you try this.
Blender wake you?

08:31.257 --> 08:35.125
lt's worth it. Because these things
are gonna blow your mind.

08:41.167 --> 08:43.658
Amazing sex.

08:44.070 --> 08:45.765
Female jocks are amazing.

08:47.907 --> 08:51.070
Thanks, but maybe could you
personalize it a little?

08:51.377 --> 08:55.211
Oh, yeah. Right, right, right.
That's what l'm saying to you, Lisa.

08:55.515 --> 08:58.541
lt's like, come on, that was--
That was unbelievable.

08:59.853 --> 09:01.184
Yeah.

09:01.354 --> 09:03.413
Are you fishing
for a compliment or--?

09:03.590 --> 09:07.185
l'm fishing for a celebration!
Come on!

09:07.360 --> 09:09.328
lt was good.

09:11.831 --> 09:13.264
Here, come on.

09:22.876 --> 09:24.138
-lt's good.
-lt's great.

09:24.711 --> 09:26.110
-lt's great.
-There you go.

09:26.279 --> 09:28.247
-Yeah.
-Good.

09:29.749 --> 09:32.946
l have to get going.
Which way is the bathroom?

09:33.119 --> 09:35.519
-lt's just right over there.
-Okay.

09:35.955 --> 09:38.219
But l'm gonna drink the rest of this...

09:38.391 --> 09:41.326
...because it was really sweet of you
to make it.

09:41.661 --> 09:43.253
lt's great.

09:44.163 --> 09:46.131
So you know that many
female athletes?

09:46.299 --> 09:47.323
Yeah, l do.

09:47.500 --> 09:50.992
l mean, you gotta count cheerleaders,
but yeah.

09:56.109 --> 09:58.805
Toothbrushes are in that drawer
on the right there.

09:58.978 --> 10:00.843
Oh, okay.

10:09.122 --> 10:10.214
No.

10:10.556 --> 10:12.990
No. You don't have to
wear that dress home.

10:13.826 --> 10:16.090
-What?
-Come here.

10:16.562 --> 10:19.258
What size? Small or extra small?

10:19.766 --> 10:21.700
Wait, what is that?

10:24.070 --> 10:27.665
-What?
-That. Behind you.

10:28.107 --> 10:31.770
That is repulsive. The stack.

10:31.945 --> 10:33.207
-No.
-No?

10:33.379 --> 10:36.871
No, no. No, it's me being classy.
lt's me being a good host.

10:37.050 --> 10:39.280
No. No. No.

10:39.819 --> 10:43.482
l feel like l'm on an assembly line
that's just spitting out girls.

10:43.656 --> 10:46.352
That's just negative. That's like....

10:46.526 --> 10:49.495
Though if you think about it,
and l never did till now...

10:49.662 --> 10:54.725
...we're all on kind of an assembly line,
just going through each other's lives.

10:54.901 --> 10:57.529
Until one day,
you close the factory down...

10:57.704 --> 11:02.698
...take one product home and use it
monogamously for the rest of your life.

11:03.409 --> 11:05.969
-My mistake, Matty. Forget it.
-No, l'm not--

11:06.145 --> 11:08.705
lt's not a mistake.
l'm just saying that--

11:08.881 --> 11:11.907
lf l'd given you one and hid the rest,
l'd be a great guy?

11:12.085 --> 11:15.077
-But because l was open with you--
-l said, forget it!

11:31.704 --> 11:34.036
Matty, what am l doing?

11:34.207 --> 11:35.731
l caught myself.

11:35.908 --> 11:38.172
Don't judge others
till you check yourself.

11:38.344 --> 11:42.041
You're lucky if it's your fault,
you can correct the situation.

11:44.350 --> 11:47.444
l'm nervous over something
that's going on with me.

11:47.620 --> 11:50.054
l'm with an attractive guy
you'd be an idiot...

11:50.223 --> 11:53.590
...to mistake for anything more
than just a fun friendship.

11:53.760 --> 11:56.160
And, yes, amazing sex.

11:57.330 --> 12:01.892
lnstead, l give that guy a hard time
for just being who he is.

12:03.936 --> 12:06.268
Totally my fault.

12:06.572 --> 12:08.335
l'm sorry.

12:09.242 --> 12:11.142
Please forgive me.

12:12.245 --> 12:15.305
-Are you apologizing?
-Yeah.

12:15.715 --> 12:20.175
lf you're really apologizing,
you may be my dream girl.

12:20.353 --> 12:22.184
l heard footsteps and l'm like:

12:22.355 --> 12:25.256
''Okay, somebody nuts is coming back
to be more nuts.''

12:25.425 --> 12:29.657
And now, an apology?
You may be my dream girl.

12:30.329 --> 12:31.853
Yeah.

13:16.809 --> 13:18.743
They said you'd be in here.

13:20.146 --> 13:21.977
How bad is this?

13:26.486 --> 13:30.980
The Justice Department is investigating
the company for security fraud.

13:31.157 --> 13:32.525
-Based on what? Why are they--?
-They don't have to say.

13:32.525 --> 13:34.322
-Based on what? Why are they--?
-They don't have to say.

13:34.494 --> 13:36.792
They've subpoenaed
everything from abroad.

13:36.963 --> 13:40.455
-You didn't tell your father? The worst--
-Of course l told him.

13:40.633 --> 13:42.294
-No.
-Yes.

13:42.468 --> 13:44.663
He's gonna meet us in my office
right now.

13:45.204 --> 13:48.230
-Your concern is...?
-l don't have one.

13:48.407 --> 13:51.240
Well, we better go.

13:51.777 --> 13:53.472
l agree.

13:56.415 --> 13:57.848
-Morning.
-Morning, Dad.

14:01.754 --> 14:06.350
We need the company lawyer for
whatever this is? What's going on?

14:11.063 --> 14:14.032
-You want a kiss too?
-Not today.

14:14.367 --> 14:16.562
-You haven't read this yet?
-Just once.

14:16.736 --> 14:18.226
They are investigating us...

14:18.404 --> 14:21.430
...for misstatement of receivables
to inflate earnings.

14:21.607 --> 14:23.734
-Stock fraud.
-What do you know about it?

14:24.243 --> 14:26.438
Nothing. But l'm responsible.

14:26.913 --> 14:28.312
What, are you being noble?

14:28.481 --> 14:30.813
l'm telling you what
recent legislation says.

14:30.983 --> 14:33.451
lf it's true and l didn't know,
l should have.

14:33.819 --> 14:38.119
Can you ask your assistant to come in?
We have to respond immediately.

14:41.227 --> 14:45.687
Annie, could you please come on in?
And bring your laptop.

14:47.466 --> 14:49.161
All these items mentioned...

14:49.335 --> 14:54.773
...you must have checked whether we
had funds before talking to the analyst.

14:55.274 --> 15:00.211
No. Most of them came from
Dad's office, so l assumed that...

15:00.379 --> 15:03.212
-...with everyone working--
-You do not assume.

15:03.382 --> 15:05.282
-Excuse me.
-You do not trust anyone.

15:05.451 --> 15:06.577
Not him, not me.

15:06.986 --> 15:08.886
Cynicism is sanity.

15:09.055 --> 15:10.886
Good guidelines, l'm afraid.

15:11.057 --> 15:14.993
l assumed that with everyone
working creatively on the new line--

15:15.161 --> 15:16.924
''Creatively.''

15:17.096 --> 15:18.256
Just a second, Dad.

15:18.698 --> 15:19.926
-Now--
-Let me finish.

15:20.299 --> 15:25.236
No! Drivel does not get to finish.
Drivel gets interrupted.

15:25.571 --> 15:27.095
ls it possible to get the--?

15:27.273 --> 15:30.333
So shaping the corporate culture
might not bring results--

15:30.509 --> 15:33.034
You are a fucking moron!

15:33.212 --> 15:34.679
-Too rough.
-Much too rough.

15:34.847 --> 15:39.580
-Don't talk like that in front of Annie.
-Okay! Okay. l caught myself.

15:40.920 --> 15:43.354
Now may l get back to the--

15:43.990 --> 15:46.823
Sorry, Annie. The fucking--

15:49.128 --> 15:51.619
Sorry again, Annie.

15:51.797 --> 15:53.355
--point.

15:54.567 --> 15:58.401
l have overlooked every limitation
l know you to have.

15:58.571 --> 16:01.802
Why? Because you are my son.

16:02.508 --> 16:06.444
And you're a good guy,
as every prick with half a brain...

16:06.612 --> 16:09.638
...who ever took advantage of you
knows absolutely.

16:09.815 --> 16:13.046
But, Gidge,
there is a bottom line here...

16:13.219 --> 16:17.553
...which is, because of your
notions of trust and creativity...

16:17.723 --> 16:23.457
...we may be inevitably forced to crawl
on by some assistant U.S. attorney.

16:23.629 --> 16:26.325
And if this ''almost made
the law review'' creature...

16:26.499 --> 16:29.059
...pins me between
a choice of saving you...

16:29.235 --> 16:32.170
...or the company that l founded
and you preside over...

16:32.605 --> 16:35.199
...l may be forced
to choose the company...

16:35.374 --> 16:40.038
...even though doing so may break my
life forever, which is finally my fault...

16:40.212 --> 16:43.409
...for handing you a job
where your pathetic assumptions...

16:43.582 --> 16:46.949
...or notions of trust
can cause such calamity!

16:47.119 --> 16:48.177
Annie!

16:48.354 --> 16:51.084
Oh, my God. l'm so sorry.
Excuse me.

16:51.390 --> 16:54.359
What? Darling, are you crying?
What's wrong?

16:54.560 --> 16:57.586
l'm fine. Oh, my God. l'm so sorry.

16:59.965 --> 17:01.660
-Charles, Annie just--
-Ron.

17:02.034 --> 17:05.663
Why don't you have Annie take down
everything you need, okay?

17:08.074 --> 17:11.099
-Okay?
-All right.

17:12.611 --> 17:16.103
You should go home now
and think about interviewing attorneys.

17:16.281 --> 17:18.944
l don't know if the company
will be allowed to pay.

17:19.352 --> 17:20.842
The company will pay.

17:24.490 --> 17:25.923
To the Justice Department:

17:26.425 --> 17:28.723
The individual's name is on here.

17:28.894 --> 17:32.193
All documents relating
to loan applications.

17:32.365 --> 17:36.734
All financial statements, including
general ledgers, income statements....

17:45.077 --> 17:46.442
Oh, God.

17:46.612 --> 17:51.572
The term ''document'' includes,
but is not limited to, all personal files...

17:51.751 --> 17:53.616
...telephone messages, and--

17:57.323 --> 17:58.790
Just a minute.

18:08.901 --> 18:10.163
Hello?

18:10.336 --> 18:13.772
<i>George. l have been
through things like this...</i>

18:13.939 --> 18:18.774
<i>...and l'd like to give you some difficult
advice, if you would like to hear it.</i>

18:19.378 --> 18:20.402
Okay.

18:21.514 --> 18:23.982
Accept the enormity.

18:24.150 --> 18:26.914
Give up illusions of containment.
The hardest fact...

18:27.086 --> 18:30.419
...is that,
no matter what the outcome...

18:30.589 --> 18:36.550
...it is unlikely you can ever again be
the person you have been until now.

18:38.697 --> 18:42.463
Okay, thanks.
Look, can l call you later?

18:42.635 --> 18:46.469
Any further contact between us
would be inappropriate.

18:47.306 --> 18:49.433
Good luck, George.

18:55.514 --> 18:58.745
ls Bryant there yet?
Yeah, it's George.

18:58.918 --> 19:01.409
Look, l need to speak with him.

19:01.787 --> 19:04.813
Yeah, well,
reach him as soon as you can.

19:04.990 --> 19:06.514
Thank you.

19:08.727 --> 19:13.130
Hi, this is George.
l've left you four messages, all urgent.

19:13.299 --> 19:16.962
You know l underplay, so l don't
understand your failure to call back.

19:17.770 --> 19:19.237
Thank you.

19:19.705 --> 19:22.139
Well? Tell me.
You must have some reaction.

19:22.641 --> 19:24.734
No, l have one.

19:24.910 --> 19:26.878
l'm just not proud of it.

19:27.480 --> 19:29.744
lt's just me being analytical.

19:31.183 --> 19:33.481
l was thinking about my work.

19:33.652 --> 19:35.142
Let me explain the thought.

19:43.462 --> 19:47.455
This is for us, l swear it.

19:50.336 --> 19:53.203
We are not well-matched
for this interval in your life.

19:53.372 --> 19:56.671
Not with me against this deadline
and you being investigated.

19:56.842 --> 20:00.073
l don't want our relationship
to become cannon fodder...

20:00.246 --> 20:03.044
...for this apparition
in your working life.

20:03.616 --> 20:06.346
l will be here for you at the end.

20:06.519 --> 20:07.850
You can count on that.

20:09.922 --> 20:12.686
You wanna split up
until l'm problem-free?

20:12.858 --> 20:14.120
Please, l'd appreciate--

20:14.293 --> 20:18.354
You're breaking up with--? Oh, my--
You're breaking up with--?

20:18.531 --> 20:21.056
l'm hitting the pause button.

20:21.233 --> 20:24.930
So that we don't waste
our precious energies on stuff.

21:23.095 --> 21:24.722
No.

21:24.897 --> 21:27.127
No. No.

21:28.267 --> 21:30.292
Nope. No, thank you.

21:34.740 --> 21:36.708
<i>Tonight l'm in</i>

21:37.276 --> 21:41.212
<i>A romantic mood, yeah</i>

21:41.847 --> 21:44.145
<i>Let's take a shower</i>

21:45.284 --> 21:47.582
<i>Shower together</i>

21:49.254 --> 21:51.484
<i>l'll wash your body</i>

21:51.657 --> 21:54.717
<i>You wash mine, yeah</i>

21:56.462 --> 22:01.593
<i>Rub me down
With some hot oils, baby</i>

22:01.767 --> 22:02.901
<i>Yeah</i>

22:09.408 --> 22:11.706
Hello. Hello?

22:12.978 --> 22:14.002
<i>Hello?</i>

22:14.179 --> 22:15.840
<i>-Hi, boss.
-Hi.</i>

22:16.015 --> 22:18.040
<i>-How are you? lt's not too late--
-No.</i>

22:18.851 --> 22:21.115
l'm fine. lt's fine.
Hold on just a second.

22:21.286 --> 22:22.344
Okay.

22:27.626 --> 22:30.993
Hey. Thanks so much for calling.

22:31.730 --> 22:34.756
l can't sleep. l don't know
what got into me this morning.

22:34.933 --> 22:37.401
l have never taken a swat
at anybody.

22:37.569 --> 22:39.560
Well, l do know. l'm pregnant.

22:39.938 --> 22:41.929
You're preg-- You're pregnant!

22:42.641 --> 22:46.042
Yeah. Secret's out.

22:46.445 --> 22:48.504
<i>You're pregnant!</i>

22:48.681 --> 22:50.410
l had a hunch.

22:58.257 --> 23:00.691
That guy that picks you up
sometimes, Al?

23:01.226 --> 23:02.750
Oh, you noticed Al.

23:02.961 --> 23:05.225
He lights up every time
he sees you.

23:05.497 --> 23:06.930
<i>So good, huh?</i>

23:07.099 --> 23:09.693
<i>He's great. He's just
been out of work lately.</i>

23:09.868 --> 23:12.530
So we've just been
marathon worrying.

23:12.705 --> 23:15.697
So l'm not myself lately.
So when your father--

23:15.874 --> 23:17.364
Oh, don't worry about it.

23:18.310 --> 23:22.076
So did you tell Terry
about what happened to you?

23:22.815 --> 23:24.373
l'd rather not get into that.

23:24.550 --> 23:27.144
<i>She bailed? You should go call...</i>

23:27.319 --> 23:31.119
...another girl. Distract yourself.
Right?

23:31.423 --> 23:33.482
Forward motion.

23:34.226 --> 23:36.421
They can't stop girls
from talking to you.

23:36.895 --> 23:39.329
My God, is that it?
They're directing people...

23:39.498 --> 23:41.489
<i>...not to talk to me?</i>

23:45.437 --> 23:50.739
l had to sign a confidentiality statement
where l'm liable financially if l....

23:50.909 --> 23:53.241
<i>With this new situation--
You know what?</i>

23:53.412 --> 23:56.006
The hell with everything!
So l lose my job.

23:56.181 --> 23:59.378
Wait, honey, l can't. ''Honey.'' Sorry.
My medical would lapse.

23:59.551 --> 24:02.520
l've gotta care for my baby.
Al still hasn't proposed....

24:02.688 --> 24:06.681
You won't lose your job, Annie, okay?
All right? Don't tell me anything.

24:07.493 --> 24:09.017
Sorry, boss.

24:10.496 --> 24:11.793
Thanks a lot.

24:13.098 --> 24:14.622
You have a good night, Annie.

24:16.268 --> 24:17.929
l am just dying for you.

24:18.137 --> 24:20.503
That's a little extreme.

24:21.206 --> 24:22.605
Just be nauseous for me.

24:24.042 --> 24:26.567
<i>Yeah. A little morning sick for me.</i>

24:26.745 --> 24:28.440
Not a problem.

24:51.303 --> 24:55.137
-Hello?
-Hi. Lisa. This is George.

24:55.641 --> 24:57.233
<i>George Madison.</i>

24:59.211 --> 25:03.648
l.... l'm not sure how to
further identify myself.

25:04.316 --> 25:06.216
<i>Your voice sounds a little familiar.</i>

25:06.385 --> 25:09.684
l made this incredibly stupid
phone call to you a few days ago.

25:09.855 --> 25:13.222
Oh, right. How you doing, George?

25:13.892 --> 25:15.655
Would you like to have dinner?

25:16.228 --> 25:18.822
<i>-But aren't you...?
-No, l am not.</i>

25:20.132 --> 25:22.362
-You see--
-You don't have to explain.

25:22.534 --> 25:25.332
l'm sort of seeing somebody,
but we can have a meal.

25:26.305 --> 25:28.034
<i>-When?
-Anytime.</i>

25:28.207 --> 25:29.231
<i>Tomorrow's clear.</i>

25:29.408 --> 25:31.205
<i>-Triplo Due?
-l'll meet you there.</i>

25:31.376 --> 25:35.244
<i>-lt's Triple Two in English.
-lt's gotta be early, 6:00. l'm in training.</i>

25:36.181 --> 25:39.082
Okay. So it's a d-- lt's a date.

25:39.251 --> 25:41.219
<i>-Okay.
-All right.</i>

25:41.386 --> 25:43.581
<i>-l have made a date.
-Bye.</i>

25:43.755 --> 25:45.313
Good night.

28:02.060 --> 28:04.153
Come on, come on.

28:19.144 --> 28:21.977
Georgie. George.

28:22.247 --> 28:24.306
-Let's go inside.
-l have a date.

28:24.483 --> 28:28.351
Date? Son, we are in
a rapidly evolving situation here.

28:28.520 --> 28:31.853
l must tell you, l was afraid
to use the telephone.

28:32.024 --> 28:33.218
Because?

28:33.392 --> 28:35.758
No. No, no. Don't tell me.

28:35.927 --> 28:39.363
l'm not ready to take on
anything that l can't handle.

28:39.531 --> 28:42.295
No, you know what?
l know exactly how to handle this.

28:42.467 --> 28:44.731
l'll treat myself
like a company in trouble.

28:44.903 --> 28:49.067
What l think is you are just indulging
in a lot of neuroses.

28:49.241 --> 28:52.176
You take on too much,
it becomes about how much...

28:52.344 --> 28:55.211
...instead of how well you handle it.
That applies now.

28:55.380 --> 28:56.574
-Stand still!
-No.

28:56.748 --> 28:59.308
You do not have the luxury
of not hearing this.

28:59.484 --> 29:01.918
Are you making me literally run
from bad news?

29:02.087 --> 29:04.817
The chickenshit board has dec--

29:10.695 --> 29:12.128
l gotta go. l have a date.

29:12.297 --> 29:14.231
What happened to you was horrific.

29:15.033 --> 29:17.160
-Stop acting tough.
-lt's the worst move!

29:17.335 --> 29:18.632
Look at the time.

29:18.804 --> 29:21.932
Hey, everybody, l have to leave.
l have a date.

29:22.107 --> 29:23.699
-What?
-Now, Lise?

29:23.875 --> 29:25.604
-Yeah.
-Lisa?

29:25.911 --> 29:27.037
Nobody's buying this.

29:27.212 --> 29:30.079
-We should protest!
-We should.

29:30.449 --> 29:32.440
Smalls, what do you want us to do?

29:32.617 --> 29:36.144
-Lisa.
-Okay. There is one thing.

29:36.321 --> 29:40.382
When l come to visit you at training
camp when you're getting ready...

29:40.559 --> 29:43.153
...just don't feel funny talking to me.

29:43.328 --> 29:46.786
Okay? Don't feel sad for me.

29:46.965 --> 29:50.765
Because my biggest fear is that
you won't be yourselves around me.

29:50.936 --> 29:54.770
l've seen that, and if that happened,
it would just make me feel like l--

29:54.940 --> 29:57.067
Like l didn't know you anymore.

29:57.242 --> 29:59.574
And l want to.

29:59.744 --> 30:01.871
l need to.

30:03.348 --> 30:05.009
Just say, ''Okay, Lisa.''

30:05.350 --> 30:07.477
Okay, Lisa.

30:07.986 --> 30:10.284
God. l--

30:10.455 --> 30:14.983
l gotta go. l gotta go.
He's waiting for me.

30:15.160 --> 30:17.094
-l love you.
-Love you. Love you.

30:17.262 --> 30:19.321
-Love you too.
-Go, Lise.

30:19.498 --> 30:21.557
-Go, Lise.
-Lise!

30:33.879 --> 30:35.346
-Hi.
-Name, please.

30:35.514 --> 30:37.209
l'm meeting George....

30:37.382 --> 30:40.943
-Madison?
-l'm not sure. l forget.

30:46.791 --> 30:49.316
Could that be him over there?

30:50.762 --> 30:52.491
l'll bet that is him.

30:53.031 --> 30:55.329
That's the sort of day l'm having.

30:56.501 --> 30:59.231
You don't have to take me.
Thank you, though.

31:06.077 --> 31:07.544
George?

31:08.613 --> 31:10.080
Are you George?

31:10.749 --> 31:12.774
l'm Lisa.

31:12.951 --> 31:15.749
-Very good of you to join me.
-Yeah.

31:17.355 --> 31:18.845
How you doing?

31:20.091 --> 31:21.786
How are you doing?

31:23.161 --> 31:24.219
l'm great.

31:24.930 --> 31:25.988
-Yeah?
-Yep.

31:26.164 --> 31:28.598
Well, treasure it.

31:31.403 --> 31:32.461
You okay?

31:32.637 --> 31:35.936
No. l'm sorry,
l'm not even aware that--

31:36.508 --> 31:41.070
l have to apologize. This might not
be the best first impression.

31:41.246 --> 31:43.476
l.... l had...

31:45.183 --> 31:47.674
...an unusual 2 4 hours.

31:47.852 --> 31:51.413
Okay. Well, the bad days
make the good ones better.

31:51.590 --> 31:53.114
So don't worry about it.

31:55.260 --> 31:57.057
ls this an ltalian restaurant?

31:57.229 --> 31:58.958
Yes, it's a very good one.

31:59.364 --> 32:00.626
Oh, yeah, it looks good.

32:00.999 --> 32:03.490
-Let's get a drink.
-None for me.

32:03.668 --> 32:07.195
You know what? You're right.
Yeah. l shouldn't drink.

32:07.372 --> 32:09.272
-Don't let me stop you.
-No, no, no.

32:09.441 --> 32:13.400
Believe me, drinking too much
two nights in a row could be a mistake.

32:15.814 --> 32:19.272
l haven't had anything since
lunch yesterday, so l'm starving.

32:20.452 --> 32:21.680
You don't drink at all?

32:21.853 --> 32:24.788
-l follow my father's rule on drinking.
-Which is?

32:24.956 --> 32:28.323
Never drink to feel better.
Only drink to feel even better.

32:29.261 --> 32:30.922
That's fantastic.

32:31.396 --> 32:32.920
Yep. lt's a good one.

32:33.098 --> 32:36.124
That's great.
But sometimes l think that...

32:36.301 --> 32:39.361
...one drink can give you
a little better perspective.

32:40.305 --> 32:42.671
Not for me.
l guess it depends on the person.

32:42.841 --> 32:47.244
Look, if you wanna have a drink,
have a drink. Keeping talking about it--

32:47.412 --> 32:50.973
l don't need permission to drink.
lf l want a drink, l'll order one.

32:51.149 --> 32:53.982
Jesus! Do you know
l don't know you?

32:54.252 --> 32:57.187
l'm sorry. l'm not good today.

32:58.056 --> 33:02.220
Maybe l should say what's going on.
l never talk about myself. l should.

33:02.494 --> 33:05.691
No! Don't do that.

33:07.399 --> 33:10.334
George, this is what l'm suggesting.
That we eat.

33:11.102 --> 33:14.299
And that we don't work
at this conversation.

33:14.472 --> 33:16.633
-Let's just cut ourselves a break...
-Yes.

33:16.808 --> 33:20.300
...and give ourselves permission
to be quiet.

33:20.478 --> 33:24.039
For the whole dinner.
Completely quiet.

33:26.418 --> 33:28.147
Can l talk to the waiter?

33:29.721 --> 33:32.815
As long as you don't tell him
about your day.

34:33.985 --> 34:36.545
l mean, that....

34:38.857 --> 34:41.052
That was just what l needed.

34:42.927 --> 34:44.985
You take care of yourself.

34:50.368 --> 34:53.098
l'm just leaving my place
to go to dinner.

34:53.271 --> 34:56.467
-Good evening, Mr. Madison. Taxi?
-Yes, thank you, Tom.

34:56.641 --> 34:59.804
Okay, Dad, l'm ready.
What happened?

34:59.978 --> 35:02.674
What if l come by later?
The phone isn't....

35:03.415 --> 35:07.511
Just tell me. l'd rather use the rest of
the night processing the information.

35:10.355 --> 35:16.021
l'm sorry, this is private.
There's still some privacy left.

35:18.096 --> 35:20.860
<i>The board is refusing to pay...</i>

35:21.032 --> 35:23.865
<i>-...your legal bills. Now--
-Hey.</i>

35:26.204 --> 35:27.933
l think l met a great girl.

35:29.340 --> 35:32.776
Oh, good. There is a God.

35:50.028 --> 35:52.997
The girls needed to tell you
how they felt.

35:53.164 --> 35:54.495
lt's something, isn't it?

35:54.899 --> 35:57.925
Last time l saw that was
when a kid died in high school...

35:58.102 --> 36:00.297
...and they left this stuff by the road.

36:00.472 --> 36:01.734
How about straight talk?

36:01.906 --> 36:04.807
l am very sensitive
to what you're going through.

36:05.176 --> 36:07.303
You know what you need most
right now?

36:07.579 --> 36:09.171
-Yes.
-What?

36:09.547 --> 36:11.344
lnsensitivity.

36:14.319 --> 36:15.843
Yeah?

36:16.955 --> 36:19.549
-Who is it?
-lt's Lisa.

36:19.724 --> 36:21.385
Could you narrow it down?

36:21.559 --> 36:22.560
l'm not kidding right now.

36:22.560 --> 36:23.925
l'm not kidding right now.

36:24.095 --> 36:28.088
A good Lisa. Come here. Get in.

36:32.136 --> 36:34.331
-You're alone, right?
-Yeah.

36:34.606 --> 36:37.074
l was just working up the night.

36:37.942 --> 36:39.307
Do you want me to be here?

36:41.279 --> 36:43.008
-Yes, l do.
-Okay.

36:43.181 --> 36:45.206
Then this is what l need.

36:45.383 --> 36:48.682
lf in the middle of the night
l start crying or...

36:48.853 --> 36:53.586
...shaking or acting enormously upset,
l don't want you to ask what's wrong.

36:53.758 --> 36:56.955
l want you to just ignore it.
ls that okay with you?

36:57.962 --> 37:00.556
-Actually, that's my preference.
-Okay, good.

37:02.233 --> 37:05.532
Have a seat. My game's coming up.

37:14.546 --> 37:17.413
<i>Matty Reynolds gets him.
The Nationals win.</i>

37:17.582 --> 37:19.846
-Good mechanics.
-Yeah.

37:29.193 --> 37:31.957
Okay. Let's go, l got it.

37:45.143 --> 37:47.008
Can you afford me?

37:47.946 --> 37:52.781
The firm is refusing to pay my legal
bills, but my father is willing to help.

37:52.951 --> 37:56.409
You can't take money from him,
not with his position on the board.

37:56.888 --> 37:58.515
What would your retainer be?

37:58.890 --> 38:04.328
Three hundred thousand, and another
three in escrow in case it goes to trial.

38:08.833 --> 38:11.597
-l suppose l could sell--
-Everything you can.

38:11.970 --> 38:13.528
Okay.

38:19.243 --> 38:21.370
-Sit down.
-l don't wanna lie down.

38:21.846 --> 38:24.144
-l said, ''Sit down.''
-l don't think you did.

38:24.315 --> 38:27.648
Yes, l did. l never ask someone
to lie down on a first visit.

38:28.786 --> 38:30.720
-Sorry.
-Okay.

38:37.328 --> 38:38.795
So...

38:40.465 --> 38:41.693
...why are you here?

38:42.667 --> 38:46.125
l have a month left on my insurance
and they pay up to six visits.

38:46.904 --> 38:49.532
l meant, is there a difficulty?

38:51.709 --> 38:52.733
Well....

38:55.113 --> 38:58.640
l'm sorry. l'm gonna go
because this is just stupid.

38:58.816 --> 39:00.841
Not that this is stupid. But l mean--

39:01.019 --> 39:04.682
Thank you for your time. Just for me,
you know. l mean, not this.

39:04.856 --> 39:07.188
-But thank you for understanding.
-All right.

39:07.358 --> 39:09.349
-Okay.
-Okay.

39:10.428 --> 39:13.420
You know, can l ask you
just one stupid question?

39:14.565 --> 39:15.589
No such thing.

39:15.767 --> 39:19.134
Because l'm leaving
and l'm not gonna do this again.

39:19.804 --> 39:23.968
l was wondering if there's one general
thing you've found over the years...

39:24.142 --> 39:26.372
...to be generally true...

39:26.544 --> 39:30.446
...in a general way
that would help anyone...

39:31.149 --> 39:32.776
...with any situation?

39:32.950 --> 39:34.975
That's a great question.

39:35.653 --> 39:37.211
Yes.

39:37.388 --> 39:41.848
l'd say, figure out what you want
and learn how to ask for it.

39:43.394 --> 39:44.986
Okay.

39:51.869 --> 39:53.530
Those are both really hard.

39:55.073 --> 39:59.271
Yes, but you came here,
which was hard for you.

39:59.444 --> 40:01.776
And you're leaving right away,
also hard.

40:01.946 --> 40:06.042
So you're tougher than
you think you are right now.

40:07.518 --> 40:09.008
Thanks.

40:09.454 --> 40:10.648
l appreciate that.

40:11.055 --> 40:13.615
-Good luck.
-Okay.

40:16.027 --> 40:18.757
-l can see why people do this.
-Thanks.

40:41.552 --> 40:44.680
l'm sorry. l thought some of them
were bringing their wives.

40:44.856 --> 40:48.690
That usually changes
the behavior considerably.

40:48.860 --> 40:52.956
The rookie who lives here had this,
maybe the best barbecue anywhere...

40:53.131 --> 40:54.689
...flown in from Houston.

40:54.866 --> 40:58.131
He bought a first-class seat
so his friend could fly it in.

40:58.302 --> 41:01.760
Wait till you taste it. Try the sauce
first. That's how you judge.

41:01.939 --> 41:05.272
-This place nails it. And you know--
-No hard feelings.

41:06.477 --> 41:10.038
You can stay, l just....
l can't do this right now.

41:12.150 --> 41:15.017
There's Christian athletes inside.
We'll eat with them.

41:15.520 --> 41:19.115
Do you ever wonder what's going on
in my life? Because you never ask.

41:19.624 --> 41:22.957
l thought l wasn't supposed to.
ls that just at night?

41:23.861 --> 41:27.422
This is-- You know what?
What l think l mean is...

41:27.598 --> 41:29.998
...l should tell you
what's going on with me.

41:35.907 --> 41:37.499
l got....

41:39.076 --> 41:41.169
Oh, God.

41:41.579 --> 41:43.046
l got cut.

41:43.681 --> 41:45.114
Sorry.

41:45.283 --> 41:49.276
Let's have some barbecue
and we'll talk about it. That's....

41:50.721 --> 41:52.052
l don't wanna eat now.

41:53.024 --> 41:54.753
l can't.

41:56.127 --> 41:57.992
You don't wanna eat anything?

41:58.162 --> 41:59.390
l just can't.

42:00.331 --> 42:01.923
Well....

42:04.836 --> 42:06.303
Okay.

42:07.238 --> 42:08.262
l'll go with you.

42:09.207 --> 42:10.231
Okay.

42:24.789 --> 42:27.758
So l'm gonna go
to grad school at night.

42:27.925 --> 42:31.793
l'll have to work a few jobs, but
l've got the private coaching thing...

42:31.963 --> 42:34.397
...and l lined up
this part-time retail thing.

42:34.565 --> 42:37.090
-That's great.
-That's good. l got that covered.

42:37.268 --> 42:39.532
l just have this problem
with my attitude.

42:39.704 --> 42:44.903
lt's like l have to get to the place where
l appreciate what the game gave me.

42:45.076 --> 42:49.479
And accept and even embrace
the obvious...

42:49.647 --> 42:52.343
...that the time comes
for every athlete when they--

42:52.516 --> 42:54.245
lt's never gonna come for me.

42:57.121 --> 42:59.112
You know what?
Maybe we shouldn't talk.

42:59.290 --> 43:01.258
Maybe we should watch TV
or something.

43:01.425 --> 43:04.986
No, no, no. Hold on, come here.

43:07.365 --> 43:09.094
l hear everything you're saying.

43:09.267 --> 43:14.330
Come sit over here. l'm gonna set you
down and make you something to eat.

43:14.505 --> 43:18.134
We get a little food in your stomach,
we'll both think better.

43:18.609 --> 43:21.373
You like inspirational stories?

43:21.545 --> 43:23.740
Okay, l got one for you.

43:23.915 --> 43:26.975
l knew a really good player once,
and the coach cut him.

43:28.219 --> 43:30.744
And the guy just felt....
He felt impotent.

43:30.922 --> 43:35.655
Now you're probably feeling whatever
the female version of that word is.

43:35.826 --> 43:36.850
lt's the same word.

43:38.596 --> 43:41.929
Don't let what's going on with you
make you give me a hard time.

43:42.099 --> 43:43.896
Because that's not productive.

43:44.068 --> 43:46.332
l'm not.
lt's the same word for women.

43:46.504 --> 43:48.404
''lmpotent''?

43:51.842 --> 43:54.242
Okay. Tie goes to the pretty one.

43:54.412 --> 43:58.041
Same word. He was feeling impotent,
just like you may be feeling.

43:58.215 --> 44:00.274
l don't think that's how l feel--

44:00.451 --> 44:01.816
Can l finish my thought?

44:01.986 --> 44:05.888
Maybe it'll help, maybe it won't,
but l'm trying.

44:07.058 --> 44:08.286
l'm sorry.

44:08.459 --> 44:10.188
-That's all right.
-Go ahead.

44:10.361 --> 44:15.230
Okay. So his girlfriend had a cat
and he started to save the cat's shit....

44:15.766 --> 44:18.428
-A little trust.
-Okay.

44:19.537 --> 44:24.167
He started to save all the cat's shit,
and every few days or so...

44:24.909 --> 44:29.209
...he'd take a little amount and wrap it
in a different package, like a gift...

44:29.380 --> 44:32.178
...or a magazine roll
or something you order online.

44:32.350 --> 44:34.318
Every few days for eight months...

44:34.485 --> 44:37.682
...he would send these cat turds
to the guy who cut him.

44:44.095 --> 44:45.653
ls that it?

44:47.064 --> 44:49.191
Yeah, that's it. lt's a great story.

44:49.367 --> 44:51.995
Did you understand it was the coach
he sent it to?

44:52.169 --> 44:56.299
To the guy who cut him?
He felt impotent, and then he....

44:56.474 --> 44:58.601
File it away. lt worked for this guy.

45:01.278 --> 45:04.213
No, so he stopped
when his anger went away--

45:04.382 --> 45:05.815
Yeah. Yeah.

45:05.983 --> 45:07.541
Well, the cat died.

45:09.887 --> 45:11.354
Oh, God.

45:11.522 --> 45:14.252
There, a smile.

45:14.625 --> 45:19.028
That's horrible.
l didn't know the cat was gonna die.

45:19.196 --> 45:20.390
You feel better.

45:20.564 --> 45:24.830
Great. l hated seeing you
touch bottom.

45:30.307 --> 45:31.535
That was sweet.

45:34.879 --> 45:36.904
Yeah, you're right.

45:39.884 --> 45:41.613
lt's okay.

45:52.797 --> 45:55.960
-You are amazing.
-You were great.

45:56.133 --> 45:59.364
-lt takes two, you know?
-At least.

45:59.670 --> 46:01.001
Creep.

46:03.541 --> 46:05.634
Oh, boy.

46:06.210 --> 46:09.373
You clap to bring on the lights
the minute we finish?

46:09.547 --> 46:11.344
Why? What's the matter?

46:12.083 --> 46:16.076
Just clapping your hands and
those dumb lights makes me feel like--

46:16.253 --> 46:19.780
Wait, wait, let me guess.
l think l can get it.

46:20.091 --> 46:22.457
Like l'm not thinking about you.

46:23.094 --> 46:24.721
Look who got it.

46:24.895 --> 46:27.921
-Yeah, look who read your mind.
-God.

46:28.099 --> 46:30.067
Yeah. What should l do?

46:31.135 --> 46:33.501
God. Turn them off!

46:34.738 --> 46:37.673
You wanna do it? Come on.
Oh, it's fun.

46:38.876 --> 46:40.639
Grow up.

46:41.112 --> 46:42.511
No.

46:47.518 --> 46:50.282
lt was kind of fun, wasn't it?

46:51.155 --> 46:53.851
l'm gonna teach you
how to have fun.

47:12.877 --> 47:14.401
-You didn't see that?
-What?

47:15.513 --> 47:18.744
Let me ask you something.
How do you know when you're in love?

47:20.217 --> 47:22.981
-lntriguing.
-Ryan. Get loose.

47:23.220 --> 47:24.687
Well....

47:27.191 --> 47:29.853
-What?
-l got a way.

47:30.027 --> 47:33.190
Whenever this one thing happens,
l know l'm done.

47:34.665 --> 47:37.361
lt's personal. l don't want
anyone making fun of me.

47:37.535 --> 47:39.560
No, no one's-- Go!

47:42.773 --> 47:46.675
l'm in love with somebody when
l wear a condom with the other girls.

47:49.547 --> 47:52.243
Holy shit, l'm in love.

48:06.197 --> 48:07.221
Hello?

48:07.565 --> 48:09.465
You up for a crazy idea?

48:09.633 --> 48:10.793
Yes.

48:10.968 --> 48:13.493
Maybe it'd be fun if you
kind of move in with me.

48:15.372 --> 48:16.703
<i>Hello? Are you there?</i>

48:16.874 --> 48:18.535
Barely.

48:19.743 --> 48:22.075
<i>-Are you serious?
-l know.</i>

48:22.546 --> 48:24.605
l told you it was crazy.

48:24.782 --> 48:27.114
Can you give me a minute
to form a thought?

48:27.284 --> 48:30.082
<i>-Yeah, yeah. Take your time.
-Okay. Thanks.</i>

48:30.254 --> 48:31.585
<i>Okay, l'll call you back.</i>

48:43.801 --> 48:45.132
That was quick.

48:45.302 --> 48:49.204
l know, but, Lisa, listen.
Today l caught myself--

48:49.373 --> 48:50.431
Thanks, Bobby.

48:51.842 --> 48:55.300
Today l caught myself wishing
you were in the bullpen with me.

48:55.479 --> 48:59.074
Literally having a daydream.
l mean, that's serious.

49:01.085 --> 49:02.848
<i>Li-- Are you there?</i>

49:03.020 --> 49:05.318
Hello? What are you doing?

49:05.723 --> 49:06.815
l think l'm thinking.

49:06.991 --> 49:10.256
Don't! You shouldn't have to think
about a great idea.

49:10.427 --> 49:12.361
You said this was a crazy idea.

49:12.529 --> 49:16.932
l know, l think it's both. l think part of
the greatness is how crazy it is.

49:17.101 --> 49:18.830
What first popped into your mind?

49:19.903 --> 49:23.031
That l don't know what to say
and it makes me feel stupid.

49:23.207 --> 49:24.333
Second thing.

49:24.508 --> 49:26.635
That l've never lived
with anyone before.

49:26.810 --> 49:29.540
Great. No one's had a chance
to ruin you.

49:31.315 --> 49:33.044
Have you ever lived with anybody?

49:33.217 --> 49:36.618
With me you get into what does
''living together'' mean...

49:36.787 --> 49:38.379
...and duration is a factor.

49:38.555 --> 49:40.716
<i>But listen, is--? Do you think...</i>

49:40.891 --> 49:43.951
...this is something...?
Do you wanna do this?

49:46.196 --> 49:48.494
<i>-Hello?
-l honestly....</i>

49:48.666 --> 49:51.066
-Yeah?
-l don't know how to figure this out.

49:51.635 --> 49:53.899
ls there tingling?
Do you have goose bumps?

49:54.071 --> 49:57.302
Maybe l need to work my voice
a little bit until you get them.

49:59.143 --> 50:00.405
l think l just got them.

50:02.046 --> 50:03.343
What?

50:03.614 --> 50:06.242
<i>-l think l just got them.
-Yeah.</i>

50:06.417 --> 50:08.044
l really like you, Matty.

50:08.252 --> 50:09.844
Okay.

50:11.021 --> 50:13.546
-Good phone call.
-Good phone call.

50:13.724 --> 50:15.817
<i>-Right? Yeah.
-Thank you.</i>

50:22.232 --> 50:24.223
This is such a mistake.

50:24.401 --> 50:27.700
-Overstepping alert.
-You sublet your apartment.

50:27.871 --> 50:32.109
You told me don't do anything halfway
unless you're willing to be half happy.

50:32.176 --> 50:36.044
Don't make important life decisions
when you are mush. lt's too dangerous.

50:36.213 --> 50:38.773
Fight low self-esteem,
don't give it the wheel.

50:38.949 --> 50:42.282
l am packed here. l am doing this.

50:42.453 --> 50:47.015
So back off, or do what you always do
for me, pull out some damn positives.

50:52.696 --> 50:54.254
l'm sorry, honey.

50:55.666 --> 50:57.099
Positives.

50:57.267 --> 51:00.703
Hell, the guy has
a 94-mile-an-hour fastball.

51:00.871 --> 51:03.704
He makes 1 4 million a year.
Go get him.

51:05.576 --> 51:08.374
-Got your bag? l cleared some space.
-Yeah, l just....

51:11.215 --> 51:13.150
-Yeah, come on in.
-Okay.

51:17.187 --> 51:20.122
Okay, l can get rid of
both of these things right here.

51:20.290 --> 51:23.589
l'll talk to the guys downstairs.
They have storage space.

51:23.761 --> 51:25.285
lt's okay.

51:25.729 --> 51:27.356
We'll make it work.

51:34.071 --> 51:35.504
Hey, boss, it's me.

51:44.081 --> 51:46.242
-Annie.
-Hi. Did you call that girl?

51:46.417 --> 51:51.753
No. You don't have to bring me food.
lt's enough that you found this place.

51:51.922 --> 51:55.323
That was selfish. You dress up
my neighborhood. Love your window?

51:55.492 --> 51:56.652
lt's great.

51:57.194 --> 51:58.218
This is--

51:58.395 --> 52:01.728
Cooking relaxes me when l can't
sleep. So why not just call her?

52:01.899 --> 52:04.561
Honestly? Because my
first impression wasn't great.

52:04.735 --> 52:07.135
l'd rather be more myself
when l see her next.

52:07.304 --> 52:09.795
What if someone beats you to her?

52:09.973 --> 52:12.874
Optimism is sanity for me right now.

52:14.044 --> 52:16.444
Please, sit down.
Make yourself comfortable.

52:16.613 --> 52:18.205
Relax.

52:20.918 --> 52:21.942
Look.

52:26.323 --> 52:27.847
l'm in a funny position...

52:28.025 --> 52:31.620
...but l know stuff about
what happened at work.

52:31.795 --> 52:34.525
l can't tell you
because of that thing l signed...

52:34.698 --> 52:39.897
...but if you start guessing, l can't help
it if this face is an open book. Look!

52:40.070 --> 52:44.302
Stop. You'd get in trouble, and just
listening could be wrongdoing for me.

52:44.475 --> 52:46.170
This information is killing me!

52:46.343 --> 52:49.642
lt's like l know someone is gonna
shoot you and l can't scream:

52:49.813 --> 52:53.977
''Watch out! That man's gonna
blow your frigging head off!''

52:54.151 --> 52:57.052
Please play this game with me,
or l'll just tell you!

52:57.221 --> 52:59.189
-No!
-For God's sake, let me unburden!

52:59.356 --> 53:03.190
Stop! Stop!
Annie, sit down, please. Sit down.

53:03.360 --> 53:07.421
Careful. You have to understand
what this is like for me right now.

53:07.931 --> 53:12.868
Picture a very angry ocean. A storm.
And l'm on this little tiny boat.

53:13.036 --> 53:16.096
And miraculously,
this boat is still afloat.

53:16.273 --> 53:19.140
And that boat is that
l haven't done anything wrong.

53:19.309 --> 53:23.177
Like letting you say something you're
legally constrained from revealing.

53:23.347 --> 53:27.249
Not doing anything wrong is
what's keeping me afloat. All right?

53:27.417 --> 53:29.612
lf l lose that, l'm gone.

53:32.089 --> 53:34.216
Don't rock the boat.

53:34.391 --> 53:36.359
-l know about the boat.
-Stop!

53:36.527 --> 53:40.190
-lt's a terrible boat! Get out of the boat!
-Respect me on this!

53:40.497 --> 53:42.590
For what it's worth, it doesn't matter.

53:44.635 --> 53:47.763
l think l've guessed
the same stuff you know.

53:48.605 --> 53:50.095
l think l know what you do.

54:06.924 --> 54:08.448
Nope.

54:09.459 --> 54:12.428
You couldn't function if you knew
what l'm talking about.

54:12.596 --> 54:14.689
Oh, l think l could.

54:15.866 --> 54:17.060
l think l am.

54:18.502 --> 54:20.493
-Leave it.
-What if l give you a hint?

54:20.671 --> 54:24.971
No, don't! Don't make me
leave my own apartment. Please.

54:32.716 --> 54:34.809
Okay. Eat something.

54:36.286 --> 54:37.776
Thank you.

54:39.289 --> 54:41.280
The lasagna looks amazing,
by the way.

54:48.332 --> 54:51.199
<i>-Hello, Dad.
-Are you coming to my place?</i>

54:51.668 --> 54:53.568
<i>-Almost there.
-Good.</i>

54:53.737 --> 54:57.002
<i>l have some disturbing news.</i>

54:57.174 --> 54:59.335
-What?
-l'll wait till you get here.

54:59.509 --> 55:02.444
Tell me. lt'd be nice to get
one piece of bad news...

55:02.613 --> 55:05.309
...without someone studying me
to see how l take it.

55:05.582 --> 55:08.346
Anger can be useful.
Watch out for the bitterness.

55:08.719 --> 55:09.845
What's the news, Dad?

55:13.557 --> 55:17.357
There are strong indications
that they are going to indict you.

55:17.794 --> 55:20.354
<i>l have canceled
everything l've got...</i>

55:20.530 --> 55:23.658
...and l am dedicating myself
completely to this.

55:26.036 --> 55:27.435
<i>George?</i>

55:54.931 --> 55:56.489
George?

55:59.636 --> 56:01.263
Oh, God, please don't kid me.

56:01.772 --> 56:02.830
How are you?

56:04.408 --> 56:06.137
Really....

56:08.045 --> 56:10.513
-Good to see you.
-Yeah.

56:11.248 --> 56:13.239
That's so funny.

56:19.256 --> 56:20.848
Thanks.

56:21.024 --> 56:23.185
-You didn't have to do that.
-Yeah, l did.

56:23.360 --> 56:25.590
So do you live in this building?

56:27.297 --> 56:29.128
Did you leave?

56:30.100 --> 56:31.397
Are you still here?

56:31.568 --> 56:32.626
Yeah. Absolutely.

56:33.570 --> 56:36.061
-Here l am.
-Okay.

56:36.606 --> 56:39.097
Sorry l'm not more hospitable.
l'm in a hurry.

56:39.276 --> 56:42.609
Can l go first?
l want to explain why l haven't called.

56:44.081 --> 56:45.878
l don't understand.

56:46.416 --> 56:50.978
l think l've made a bad assumption that
we've been on the same wavelength.

56:51.154 --> 56:54.055
That didn't come out right at all.
l didn't mean--

56:56.193 --> 56:58.559
l didn't quite mean to say that either.

56:58.929 --> 57:02.695
You ever wanna delete every sentence
you say, even as you say them?

57:02.866 --> 57:04.561
-No.
-No?

57:05.302 --> 57:09.005
You're funny. You know,
l'm really glad l ran into you.

57:09.072 --> 57:10.699
l bit your head off at dinner.

57:10.874 --> 57:14.742
l have this thing about rudeness,
so l'm glad l could say l'm sorry.

57:16.113 --> 57:17.137
-No--
-Lisa!

57:17.314 --> 57:20.112
Yeah! l'm in the kitchen!

57:21.585 --> 57:23.143
Hey, babe.

57:23.520 --> 57:25.988
George, this is my boyfriend, Matty.

57:28.291 --> 57:29.952
Nice to meet you.

57:31.695 --> 57:33.925
-Who is he?
-You didn't even say hello.

57:34.097 --> 57:37.533
l think you should check with me
before inviting some guy over...

57:37.701 --> 57:40.898
...so l'm a little too pissed off
to just say hello.

57:43.206 --> 57:44.833
Can l talk to you?

57:54.017 --> 57:57.077
-Why would l check with you?
-Want me to state the obvious?

57:57.254 --> 58:01.588
l have to check with you before inviting
someone up who carried our groceries?

58:01.758 --> 58:05.216
l didn't know about the groceries.
Maybe that changes things.

58:05.462 --> 58:06.895
l think it does.

58:07.063 --> 58:08.655
-Good talk.
-Wait. No.

58:08.832 --> 58:10.800
What's this obvious thing
l'm missing?

58:10.967 --> 58:15.165
Let's forget it. Otherwise, you want
me to put my foot in the trap? Okay.

58:15.338 --> 58:18.865
There's no trap. But let's show up
here. What am l missing?

58:19.176 --> 58:21.508
Okay. That this is my place.

58:24.047 --> 58:26.515
This is my place.

58:27.350 --> 58:29.147
Oh, boy.

58:32.722 --> 58:33.814
So long, Matty.

58:39.229 --> 58:40.890
Lisa, what are you doing?

58:41.064 --> 58:43.498
Congratulations,
you get your sock drawer back.

58:43.667 --> 58:47.034
Lisa, you can't do this.
We have a guest.

58:48.338 --> 58:51.501
Okay, you can have people over.
Without asking.

58:51.675 --> 58:53.870
You won't abuse the privilege. Right?

58:54.044 --> 58:57.571
There's also the safety issue,
which everyone's ignoring.

58:57.747 --> 58:58.873
Can you get the door?

59:11.695 --> 59:13.287
l think l screwed up.

59:13.463 --> 59:14.760
Not from my perspective.

59:14.931 --> 59:16.523
Yeah, thanks, buddy.

59:28.678 --> 59:30.111
Thanks.

59:31.882 --> 59:33.975
-Taxi?
-No, thanks, Tom.

59:34.150 --> 59:38.780
l just have to figure out
where l'm going.

59:46.496 --> 59:48.464
-Hey.
-Hey.

59:48.632 --> 59:51.328
Do you live around here?
l need to charge my phone.

59:51.501 --> 59:53.230
Yeah, l live pretty close.

59:53.470 --> 59:56.132
About an hour. By bus.

59:56.306 --> 59:57.671
l don't wanna mislead you.

59:58.208 --> 01:00:01.143
-Yeah. Okay.
-Okay.

01:00:02.045 --> 01:00:04.605
-Here.
-Thanks.

01:00:04.781 --> 01:00:06.749
-l'll take it. l got it.
-Thanks.

01:00:08.251 --> 01:00:10.583
lt's an hour 1 0, maybe.

01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:18.193
Hello, sir.

01:00:18.361 --> 01:00:20.591
Yes, she just came down.

01:00:20.764 --> 01:00:22.595
Okay, l'll try.

01:00:39.182 --> 01:00:42.549
Sorry, sir, l just wasn't able
to contact her for you.

01:00:59.035 --> 01:01:01.833
Man, so dead.

01:01:02.005 --> 01:01:05.202
lt's a new place.
l haven't totally unpacked yet.

01:01:05.375 --> 01:01:08.469
-Are you hungry?
-Lately? Always.

01:01:08.645 --> 01:01:10.510
Why are you asking?
You got nibbles?

01:01:10.714 --> 01:01:13.979
Oh, yes. Do you wanna hear a list?

01:01:17.287 --> 01:01:18.686
Lisa?

01:01:20.490 --> 01:01:23.653
l'm sorry, did you say something?
l was distracted.

01:01:23.827 --> 01:01:27.228
So was l. You wanna hear
a list of what l've got?

01:01:28.064 --> 01:01:31.090
-l'm not gonna be great company.
-Are you kidding me?

01:01:31.267 --> 01:01:35.499
This is the best conversation l've had
since the night we didn't talk.

01:01:36.940 --> 01:01:39.568
-Well, that's sort of funny.
-Flying start.

01:01:39.943 --> 01:01:42.173
Hey, what can l do to help?

01:01:48.118 --> 01:01:49.517
You make your own pot pie?

01:01:49.686 --> 01:01:54.180
A friend. Plates and silverware
are over here.

01:02:06.036 --> 01:02:07.867
Hello?

01:02:08.038 --> 01:02:10.529
lt doesn't matter where l am.

01:02:11.574 --> 01:02:12.871
You're gonna yell at me?

01:02:13.043 --> 01:02:16.171
That's it? That's why you called?
You know what l thin--

01:02:16.346 --> 01:02:17.779
Wait.

01:02:18.415 --> 01:02:20.576
You're gonna lose me.

01:02:24.254 --> 01:02:28.122
Just as well. lt wasn't gonna
go well from there anyway.

01:02:28.291 --> 01:02:30.384
l think we both need
some time to think.

01:02:33.196 --> 01:02:35.960
-Do you have any Guinness?
-l will get Guinness.

01:02:36.132 --> 01:02:38.032
-Don't go out of your way.
-No, no.

01:02:38.201 --> 01:02:42.160
l make a great drink, if you wanna
try it. lt's not an idle remark, l do.

01:02:42.338 --> 01:02:45.796
Okay. l'll try something.
Just not too strong.

01:02:46.476 --> 01:02:47.909
What am l doing?

01:02:48.078 --> 01:02:53.038
Stay honest with yourself when making
a mistake, there might be a takeaway.

01:02:53.917 --> 01:02:57.512
l'm gonna get drunk because
l'm too lame to stand how l feel.

01:02:57.787 --> 01:02:59.084
Great choice.

01:02:59.255 --> 01:03:01.223
-Could you do me a favor?
-Absolutely.

01:03:01.391 --> 01:03:03.689
And thank you for the opportunity.

01:03:04.494 --> 01:03:07.827
Could you not...?
l have a boyfriend, so could we just...?

01:03:08.531 --> 01:03:10.158
-Yes.
-Really?

01:03:10.467 --> 01:03:12.025
Yes.

01:03:12.502 --> 01:03:15.096
l have a teammate,
or an ex-teammate...

01:03:15.271 --> 01:03:19.674
...who says the only time l say anything
is when l drink Guinness, so watch out.

01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:26.947
Well, l think you've been saying a lot
without drinking.

01:03:27.117 --> 01:03:29.415
You are truly something.

01:03:29.886 --> 01:03:34.255
Which means my thinking about you
isn't just an aspect of the trouble l'm in.

01:03:34.424 --> 01:03:36.016
l don't follow you.

01:03:36.726 --> 01:03:38.694
-You're in some sort of trouble?
-No--

01:03:38.862 --> 01:03:42.161
First things first. l'll be right back.
Make yourself at home.

01:03:42.332 --> 01:03:43.765
Okay.

01:04:06.689 --> 01:04:08.054
Sorry.

01:04:11.394 --> 01:04:12.986
l got it!

01:04:13.897 --> 01:04:17.765
Okay, Lisa, if you're not back
in an hour, forget it. That's it.

01:04:17.934 --> 01:04:21.597
Okay, l'm removing the deadline.
Any time's good.

01:04:21.905 --> 01:04:23.167
l--

01:04:23.339 --> 01:04:26.706
l may have contributed
to the misunderstanding.

01:04:26.876 --> 01:04:30.710
l mean, if you could see my face,
you'd see how upset l am.

01:04:31.214 --> 01:04:32.943
Hold on, l'm gonna--

01:04:43.059 --> 01:04:45.027
No, let me....

01:04:48.431 --> 01:04:50.865
<i>Turn off the lights</i>

01:04:52.302 --> 01:04:53.870
<i>And light a candle</i>

01:05:05.548 --> 01:05:07.709
<i>Let's take a shower</i>

01:05:08.985 --> 01:05:11.249
<i>Shower together</i>

01:05:12.889 --> 01:05:15.380
<i>l'll wash your body</i>

01:05:15.592 --> 01:05:18.152
<i>You wash mine, yeah</i>

01:05:19.362 --> 01:05:23.958
<i>Rub me down
With some hot oils, baby</i>

01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:33.809
All right. l hope l haven't
built this up too much.

01:05:37.513 --> 01:05:40.846
-Okay. Tell me what you think.
-Oh, good.

01:05:45.588 --> 01:05:46.612
lt's good, right?

01:05:46.789 --> 01:05:49.121
-lt's delicious.
-Thanks. My own creation.

01:05:49.292 --> 01:05:53.752
l used to be a bartender, when l was
working my way through bartending.

01:05:56.599 --> 01:05:58.590
Oh, here. Please.

01:05:59.102 --> 01:06:02.094
Come here.
To people who make toasts.

01:06:03.606 --> 01:06:05.437
l just touched your leg.

01:06:05.708 --> 01:06:07.300
l know.

01:06:08.678 --> 01:06:11.169
So my father would rather
l was more...

01:06:12.715 --> 01:06:14.512
...dynamic. Okay?

01:06:15.285 --> 01:06:19.619
He raised me since l was 7 because--
And wait till you hear this.

01:06:19.822 --> 01:06:21.790
People go crazy over it.

01:06:21.958 --> 01:06:24.791
l'm serious, be prepared
to see me through new eyes.

01:06:25.061 --> 01:06:26.722
-Okay.
-l become...

01:06:27.930 --> 01:06:29.727
...dangerously appealing.

01:06:29.899 --> 01:06:32.060
Yeah. You'll wanna sit up
for this one.

01:06:32.235 --> 01:06:34.703
-Okay.
-Here l go. Okay.

01:06:39.075 --> 01:06:40.406
My mother left us...

01:06:40.576 --> 01:06:44.034
<i>...after seeing Kramer vs. Kramer
at the movies one afternoon.</i>

01:06:46.282 --> 01:06:48.477
-Do you know the picture?
-No.

01:06:48.951 --> 01:06:52.478
lt's a movie about a woman who
leaves Dustin Hoffman and her son...

01:06:52.655 --> 01:06:54.919
...because she had to
find out who she was.

01:06:55.258 --> 01:06:56.657
That's strange.

01:06:56.826 --> 01:06:59.590
She came back. ln the movie.

01:07:02.498 --> 01:07:05.956
l have to make those old ''sucking
it up'' lessons work for me now.

01:07:06.135 --> 01:07:09.002
Like when we lost
the NCAA championship by one run.

01:07:09.172 --> 01:07:13.302
And instead of having some
self-pitying, self-indulgent...

01:07:13.476 --> 01:07:18.140
...Kleenex party, we did a little good.
There were these kids there, and--

01:07:18.348 --> 01:07:20.748
-Are you bored?
-Transfixed.

01:07:21.584 --> 01:07:24.678
Cut it out.
l don't understand what you're doing.

01:07:24.854 --> 01:07:26.754
These cannot be moves.

01:07:28.257 --> 01:07:30.725
Do l sound like
l'm feeling sorry for myself?

01:07:30.893 --> 01:07:33.384
Go ahead. No, come on.
You were saying?

01:07:36.332 --> 01:07:39.699
Most of the girls l play with,
when they're done playing...

01:07:39.869 --> 01:07:44.329
...their plan is meet a guy,
love, have a baby...

01:07:45.141 --> 01:07:49.202
...go to grad school and get a job.
l mean, l'm doing those things...

01:07:49.379 --> 01:07:53.008
...but my problem,
my challenge is....

01:07:53.683 --> 01:07:55.674
-Oh, God, shut me up.
-No, no, no!

01:07:55.852 --> 01:07:58.184
You're saying exactly what
you need to say.

01:07:58.354 --> 01:08:00.982
Just let it out. Talk.
Otherwise, disease starts--

01:08:01.157 --> 01:08:02.818
Why don't you shut up too?

01:08:02.992 --> 01:08:05.961
What do you know, except
looking at me like you're Bambi?

01:08:06.129 --> 01:08:08.324
Have you ever seen that movie?

01:08:08.865 --> 01:08:11.629
Yeah. lt's a wonderful film. l own it.

01:08:14.170 --> 01:08:17.298
-Oh, jeez. l'm sorry.
-No.

01:08:17.473 --> 01:08:19.270
-l'm sorry.
-lt's all right.

01:08:20.609 --> 01:08:23.841
l bet you're glad you fed me
all those drinks.

01:08:26.448 --> 01:08:29.282
Your problem? Your challenge?

01:08:35.792 --> 01:08:39.591
l don't know if l have what it takes. . .

01:08:40.263 --> 01:08:42.959
. . .for everybody's regular plan.

01:08:46.435 --> 01:08:49.234
l've never felt, like, that love...

01:08:49.404 --> 01:08:53.603
...like the guy is
the whole deal, like.... Like....

01:08:53.776 --> 01:08:57.576
To be honest, the baby thing?
Never. Never.

01:08:59.448 --> 01:09:01.814
l'm just good at this one thing,
you know?

01:09:01.984 --> 01:09:06.011
And when l hear girls talking about
how in love they are...

01:09:06.189 --> 01:09:09.124
...or how the baby is everything...

01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:13.126
. . . l think they're pretending.

01:09:37.386 --> 01:09:39.149
What sort of trouble are you in?

01:09:42.325 --> 01:09:45.852
Simply put,
l'm currently unemployed.

01:09:46.028 --> 01:09:48.496
My girlfriend recently
broke up with me.

01:09:48.663 --> 01:09:50.564
l'll soon run out of money.

01:09:50.733 --> 01:09:53.224
And l'm the target
of a federal investigation.

01:09:57.306 --> 01:09:59.900
Wow, you're a real chick magnet,
aren't you?

01:10:11.153 --> 01:10:12.950
l'm sorry.

01:10:13.122 --> 01:10:14.612
Well, we'll see.

01:10:15.758 --> 01:10:17.817
-What impresses me about--
-Know what--

01:10:17.994 --> 01:10:19.689
l'm sorry. Did l interrupt you?

01:10:19.862 --> 01:10:23.855
No, no. Please, go ahead. l didn't
mean to interrupt your train of thought.

01:10:24.033 --> 01:10:27.196
You-- Pl-- Go ahead.
What impresses you about me?

01:10:27.670 --> 01:10:29.968
You haven't let anything
take your spirit.

01:10:30.139 --> 01:10:33.267
No. Not tonight.

01:10:35.044 --> 01:10:39.105
Tonight you've done me a great turn.
You've given me temporary amnesia.

01:10:39.615 --> 01:10:42.106
-Get out of here.
-You have.

01:10:42.985 --> 01:10:47.422
l can't believe you tell me
all you just did, and then flirt with me.

01:10:47.790 --> 01:10:49.382
Amazing.

01:10:53.396 --> 01:10:55.762
Why is the government...?

01:10:56.566 --> 01:10:59.535
l don't know. Truly.

01:10:59.702 --> 01:11:01.067
l'm...

01:11:02.071 --> 01:11:03.339
...honest.

01:11:13.716 --> 01:11:14.740
Hey, Matty.

01:11:14.917 --> 01:11:18.114
Lisa. First of all, l'm not gonna
ask you where you've been.

01:11:18.287 --> 01:11:20.278
But l get points for that, right?

01:11:20.456 --> 01:11:22.185
Not when you put it like that.

01:11:22.358 --> 01:11:25.691
Okay, l screw up.
That's why l wrote something out...

01:11:25.861 --> 01:11:29.228
...that l wanna say to you. Okay.

01:11:29.498 --> 01:11:31.796
Okay, this will be good.

01:11:31.968 --> 01:11:33.333
ls it bad l wrote it out?

01:11:33.502 --> 01:11:37.097
lt's unusual, not bad. Stop asking me
things like that. lt's weird.

01:11:37.273 --> 01:11:40.538
Sorry. l went nuts when you left.
l broke a lamp.

01:11:41.811 --> 01:11:44.279
Okay, read me the thing.

01:11:44.614 --> 01:11:46.104
That was the thing.

01:11:50.019 --> 01:11:52.487
Well, then l'm deeply touched.

01:11:52.855 --> 01:11:54.117
<i>You really broke a lamp?</i>

01:11:54.290 --> 01:11:57.123
Yeah, l mean, l just smashed it.

01:11:57.293 --> 01:11:59.227
<i>lt's destroyed. You should see it.</i>

01:12:00.696 --> 01:12:05.360
Okay, what else do l do here?
Please come back!

01:12:05.534 --> 01:12:08.662
That's.... You know,
that's giant for me to say.

01:12:08.838 --> 01:12:12.296
<i>l don't know that l'll do great,
but l know l can do better.</i>

01:12:13.442 --> 01:12:16.138
Whoa, this is breakthrough stuff
for me here!

01:12:17.213 --> 01:12:19.807
<i>-Okay.
-Great. Okay.</i>

01:12:19.982 --> 01:12:22.007
<i>-l'll see you soon.
-Bye. l'll see you.</i>

01:12:22.184 --> 01:12:23.776
All right. Bye.

01:12:30.359 --> 01:12:32.259
l'll help you get a cab.

01:12:33.062 --> 01:12:34.620
Thanks.

01:12:41.270 --> 01:12:43.067
Hey, George.

01:12:44.140 --> 01:12:46.506
Thanks for being
such a great listener.

01:12:48.711 --> 01:12:52.010
And no matter what,
l get to have friends.

01:13:01.123 --> 01:13:02.852
l will take you up on that.

01:13:05.461 --> 01:13:07.053
Okay.

01:13:21.510 --> 01:13:25.071
-Thanks.
-Thanks. Yeah.

01:13:27.917 --> 01:13:32.445
Slump city can be murder,
so call me whenever.

01:13:43.899 --> 01:13:47.335
Of every thought l had about you,
and there were millions...

01:13:47.503 --> 01:13:52.668
...the one that never occurred to me
is that my mind wasn't exaggerating.

01:13:52.942 --> 01:13:57.140
Cut it out. l go boyfriend.

01:14:01.784 --> 01:14:03.615
Fifteenth and l.

01:14:17.466 --> 01:14:20.924
-l'm not saying she was reaching out.
-Okay.

01:14:21.103 --> 01:14:25.301
l'm not saying she was coming on.
But she was definitely talking to me.

01:14:29.612 --> 01:14:31.773
You have to see your father.

01:14:31.947 --> 01:14:33.574
Why?

01:14:34.617 --> 01:14:38.519
He's one of the few people
willing to talk to you.

01:14:41.891 --> 01:14:43.483
Tell him....

01:14:43.759 --> 01:14:45.693
Oh, God.

01:14:49.365 --> 01:14:51.993
Your son is here to see you,
Mr. Madison.

01:14:56.672 --> 01:14:58.299
Finally.

01:14:59.975 --> 01:15:02.500
Have you been avoiding me?

01:15:03.813 --> 01:15:05.508
Yes.

01:15:05.915 --> 01:15:07.041
Absolutely.

01:15:07.650 --> 01:15:09.242
Why?

01:15:13.756 --> 01:15:15.348
Did you do it?

01:15:17.259 --> 01:15:18.351
Did l...?

01:15:19.762 --> 01:15:21.286
Do it.

01:15:22.198 --> 01:15:25.725
My gosh. You're not asking if--

01:15:25.901 --> 01:15:28.028
No. What l'm asking...

01:15:28.671 --> 01:15:30.434
...is did you...

01:15:30.606 --> 01:15:34.007
...fabricate earnings for the analysts
and either knowingly...

01:15:34.343 --> 01:15:37.073
...or accidentally,
put me in this spot?

01:15:37.246 --> 01:15:39.737
Did you do that? And if you did...

01:15:39.915 --> 01:15:42.782
...are you still looking,
even at this moment...

01:15:42.952 --> 01:15:44.852
...for a way to handle it, and me...

01:15:45.020 --> 01:15:47.784
...without telling me
you committed a criminal act?

01:15:47.957 --> 01:15:50.653
Now, wait. Just, easy.

01:15:51.026 --> 01:15:55.360
This ground we're stepping on here
is wall-to-wall minefields.

01:15:57.099 --> 01:16:01.092
Oh, for God's sakes. You're a crook.

01:16:02.204 --> 01:16:05.139
What exactly did you do?

01:16:06.308 --> 01:16:07.741
l did...

01:16:07.910 --> 01:16:10.970
...what everybody who does business
in the Mideast does...

01:16:11.313 --> 01:16:14.373
...who is not Microsoft
or selling something indispensable.

01:16:15.451 --> 01:16:20.252
You pay a toll in the Mideast,
no matter what the country is!

01:16:20.422 --> 01:16:24.654
lf you want to sell in Egypt,
you go there! You rent an office--

01:16:24.827 --> 01:16:28.820
Stop shouting. l don't hear you
when you do that, ever.

01:16:33.435 --> 01:16:35.630
-Never?
-Ever.

01:16:47.516 --> 01:16:49.245
You go there...

01:16:50.386 --> 01:16:52.513
...you rent an office....

01:16:54.290 --> 01:16:56.349
lt's hard not to yell.

01:16:57.960 --> 01:17:01.487
You go there
and you bribe an Egyptian.

01:17:01.664 --> 01:17:03.564
That is what l did.

01:17:03.732 --> 01:17:06.565
Like everybody does.

01:17:06.735 --> 01:17:09.499
l bribed an Egyptian.

01:17:10.039 --> 01:17:13.440
We know pissing in the street
is against the law.

01:17:13.609 --> 01:17:16.169
This is spitting in the street.

01:17:16.345 --> 01:17:18.142
This is:

01:17:21.283 --> 01:17:24.116
l didn't think that
it would ever touch you.

01:17:25.521 --> 01:17:29.981
And l wish l could somehow express
how what is happening to you...

01:17:30.159 --> 01:17:33.356
...is the most wrenching experience
of my life.

01:17:33.796 --> 01:17:35.661
And it's not just emotional.

01:17:35.831 --> 01:17:37.423
lt's physical.

01:17:37.599 --> 01:17:41.194
lt hurts in a profound, deep way.

01:17:41.370 --> 01:17:43.668
My muscles. My skin.

01:17:44.173 --> 01:17:46.835
Like those side effects
l got from Lipitor.

01:17:48.544 --> 01:17:50.171
l am anguishing...

01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:56.712
...in every way because of
what you are going through.

01:17:56.885 --> 01:17:57.909
And l just....

01:17:58.220 --> 01:17:59.585
Oh, stop.

01:17:59.755 --> 01:18:02.417
You damn narcissist, no, you don't.

01:18:02.591 --> 01:18:05.185
You can't cry! You...

01:18:05.361 --> 01:18:06.919
...ethical mutant!

01:18:09.665 --> 01:18:12.429
Better pace yourself, son.

01:18:13.068 --> 01:18:14.433
lt gets worse.

01:18:15.671 --> 01:18:17.434
l'm gonna miss you, babe.

01:18:17.606 --> 01:18:19.471
Echo that.

01:18:20.542 --> 01:18:22.407
What are you gonna
do with yourself?

01:18:22.578 --> 01:18:25.706
Well, l'll be teaching these great kids
at this clinic.

01:18:25.881 --> 01:18:30.284
Then l'm gonna register for classes.
And the team is playing close by...

01:18:30.452 --> 01:18:33.444
...so l was thinking about stopping by,
but anyway....

01:18:36.658 --> 01:18:38.148
Yeah.

01:18:40.362 --> 01:18:43.763
-We need to talk a second.
-Okay. l will call you from the car.

01:18:45.034 --> 01:18:47.025
Are we monogamous?

01:18:48.237 --> 01:18:50.501
You feel this way
because of the road trip.

01:18:50.672 --> 01:18:52.367
But we don't have time for this.

01:18:52.541 --> 01:18:54.509
How long does it take to answer?

01:18:54.676 --> 01:18:56.576
Well, the answer is yes, of course.

01:18:57.246 --> 01:18:59.771
-Essentially.
-What is ''essentially''?

01:19:00.349 --> 01:19:03.978
Let's talk about it. ''Essentially.''
Here we go.

01:19:06.522 --> 01:19:09.685
Look, l am nothing like
the wild man l used to be.

01:19:09.858 --> 01:19:13.453
lf it bothers you, l can attempt to
cut out even the anonymous sex...

01:19:13.629 --> 01:19:16.792
...because l think we're heading
for the biggest result...

01:19:16.965 --> 01:19:21.299
...that can happen for a dating couple,
and l'm thrilled about that.

01:19:21.470 --> 01:19:23.404
Anonymous sex?

01:19:23.572 --> 01:19:27.167
A guy's willing to go 1 000 miles
for you, and you criticize him...

01:19:27.342 --> 01:19:32.405
...because he admittedly hasn't
covered that last yard yet?

01:19:35.751 --> 01:19:38.914
But damn it, you know he's trying.
Your heart goes out a--

01:19:40.522 --> 01:19:41.921
Lisa?

01:19:42.091 --> 01:19:43.683
Lisa.

01:19:45.027 --> 01:19:46.187
Lisa?

01:19:47.196 --> 01:19:50.757
You have to get the team bus!
You never miss the team bus!

01:19:51.133 --> 01:19:52.225
Okay.

01:19:53.735 --> 01:19:56.033
-We'll talk.
-Okay.

01:19:56.271 --> 01:19:59.138
Okay, l'll catch the--
l'm gonna be on time.

01:19:59.308 --> 01:20:01.299
-But we'll talk, okay?
-We'll talk.

01:20:01.477 --> 01:20:03.240
l'm moving out, but we'll talk.

01:20:03.412 --> 01:20:07.439
No, no, no! You can't--
Don't break up with me.

01:20:08.083 --> 01:20:12.042
See, that's the thing. l don't know
if what we have is even breakable.

01:20:12.221 --> 01:20:16.180
Of course it is, and you're doing it.
Where are you gonna go?

01:20:17.326 --> 01:20:21.524
My tenants hate my place and want to
get out. Just don't miss the team bus.

01:20:21.964 --> 01:20:26.196
Okay. l'm gonna be monogamous.
l'm gonna be. But you too, right?

01:20:26.368 --> 01:20:29.132
You can still move out,
but you'll be monogamous too?

01:20:29.304 --> 01:20:30.328
-Sure.
-Okay?

01:20:31.740 --> 01:20:32.968
Give me a real yes.

01:20:34.143 --> 01:20:35.201
-Yeah.
-Okay.

01:20:35.377 --> 01:20:38.471
l think it's gonna be okay.
l know it's gonna be okay.

01:20:38.647 --> 01:20:40.512
-Go.
-All right.

01:20:42.751 --> 01:20:47.279
Why do girls always look so pretty
the minute they're not sure about you?

01:20:47.456 --> 01:20:49.890
Just get out of here.

01:20:50.559 --> 01:20:53.027
Okay, no not answering the phone!

01:20:53.962 --> 01:20:55.987
Monogamy!

01:21:02.371 --> 01:21:04.032
Take my advice.

01:21:04.206 --> 01:21:06.504
l think you should
get away from me.

01:21:06.675 --> 01:21:08.165
-What?
-Cut me off.

01:21:08.343 --> 01:21:11.437
l have just been trying
to avoid an inevitable here.

01:21:11.613 --> 01:21:14.582
l work better with facts. Tell me.

01:21:15.450 --> 01:21:16.610
How does it get worse?

01:21:24.826 --> 01:21:26.589
George.

01:21:27.329 --> 01:21:31.891
l worked for a boiler stock operation
when l was 1 9.

01:21:32.067 --> 01:21:34.558
There was a violation.

01:21:36.104 --> 01:21:38.971
l got one year's probation.

01:21:39.141 --> 01:21:41.974
Okay, and you're bringing this up
now because...?

01:21:43.812 --> 01:21:45.302
Go.

01:21:45.647 --> 01:21:47.512
Because of that...

01:21:47.683 --> 01:21:51.380
...if they find me at all responsible
for the current problems...

01:21:51.553 --> 01:21:55.990
...l would be classified
as a repeat offender.

01:21:56.692 --> 01:21:58.489
And your sentence would be...?

01:22:00.395 --> 01:22:03.387
Twenty-five years to dead.

01:22:04.700 --> 01:22:07.294
That's why l didn't come forward.

01:22:12.207 --> 01:22:13.765
Dad...

01:22:15.611 --> 01:22:16.976
...what are we gonna do?

01:22:18.413 --> 01:22:22.975
l need you to go because l am in
a wrestling match with myself here.

01:22:23.151 --> 01:22:26.609
l can't trust myself
not to manipulate you.

01:22:26.788 --> 01:22:29.951
l don't know if l'm doing it now.

01:22:31.827 --> 01:22:32.953
l think l am.

01:22:33.795 --> 01:22:35.786
Why? ls there something else?

01:22:37.466 --> 01:22:40.993
Oh, God! Has it occurred to you,
even as a possibility...

01:22:41.169 --> 01:22:45.367
...that you can say what the situation is
without trying to control the outcome?

01:22:45.907 --> 01:22:48.137
-No.
-Try!

01:22:56.918 --> 01:23:00.945
lf you were to plead out,
the sentence would be three years...

01:23:01.123 --> 01:23:04.183
...with a chance of getting it down
to less than two.

01:23:07.562 --> 01:23:09.223
And you'd...?

01:23:09.464 --> 01:23:12.627
Get off. Maybe.

01:23:13.568 --> 01:23:14.660
Probably.

01:23:21.810 --> 01:23:22.834
ls that everything?

01:23:24.046 --> 01:23:25.513
Yeah.

01:23:30.619 --> 01:23:32.553
So it's either....

01:23:38.994 --> 01:23:40.427
l--

01:23:52.607 --> 01:23:54.165
U.S.A.!

01:23:55.544 --> 01:23:57.876
Good game, coach. All right.

01:24:01.249 --> 01:24:03.240
-Good game.
-Good game.

01:24:48.730 --> 01:24:51.528
<i>-Hello? Hello?
-Hello?</i>

01:24:51.700 --> 01:24:53.691
Hello? Can you hear me?

01:24:53.869 --> 01:24:55.598
-Hello?
-George?

01:24:56.405 --> 01:24:59.033
-Hi.
-Hi.

01:24:59.608 --> 01:25:00.939
How are you doing?

01:25:01.143 --> 01:25:03.475
Good. You okay?

01:25:04.513 --> 01:25:07.073
-Yeah. Are you home?
-Yeah.

01:25:07.249 --> 01:25:08.910
Good.

01:25:09.084 --> 01:25:11.484
-You okay?
-Yeah. Sure am.

01:25:11.653 --> 01:25:13.348
l just....

01:25:13.955 --> 01:25:15.820
l hope it's not too late to call.

01:25:17.392 --> 01:25:18.450
No. No.

01:25:19.227 --> 01:25:22.458
Not at all. What--? What's going on?

01:25:22.631 --> 01:25:26.658
Oh, good. Nothing. l just....

01:25:26.835 --> 01:25:28.962
We made an indefinite plan
to hang out...

01:25:29.137 --> 01:25:32.231
...so l just thought l'd nail it down.

01:25:32.407 --> 01:25:34.375
Schedule my week.

01:25:35.076 --> 01:25:38.170
Well, anytime.

01:25:38.713 --> 01:25:41.614
Though soon would be advisable.

01:25:41.783 --> 01:25:45.514
l mean, l guess
it's too late for tonight.

01:25:45.687 --> 01:25:48.588
-No, not at all.
-Okay.

01:25:48.757 --> 01:25:52.887
l'm waiting for a call from my friend,
in case she has her baby tonight...

01:25:53.061 --> 01:25:55.291
...but we can deal with that
if it happens.

01:25:55.464 --> 01:25:57.523
Yeah, yeah, we can deal
with that or--

01:25:58.233 --> 01:26:01.225
What the heck?
Let's just give it a shot.

01:26:02.103 --> 01:26:05.004
So l could be there in...

01:26:06.441 --> 01:26:08.875
-...less than 30 minutes.
-Good.

01:26:09.277 --> 01:26:12.644
Although, you know, this time
of night, it could be sooner.

01:26:12.814 --> 01:26:13.838
Great.

01:26:14.015 --> 01:26:15.505
Good. l hope so.

01:26:16.818 --> 01:26:20.914
Okay. So l'll see you soon...

01:26:21.823 --> 01:26:24.087
...and we'll just hang out.

01:26:24.926 --> 01:26:27.087
l mean, do you feel like
hanging out or--?

01:26:27.596 --> 01:26:29.120
Yes.

01:26:30.966 --> 01:26:32.058
Okay.

01:26:32.234 --> 01:26:33.701
Okay.

01:26:34.302 --> 01:26:35.667
Okay.

01:26:37.939 --> 01:26:39.201
Bye.

01:26:39.508 --> 01:26:41.032
Bye.

01:27:08.570 --> 01:27:09.594
Hi.

01:27:09.771 --> 01:27:11.432
l think l should go.

01:27:12.707 --> 01:27:14.038
Yeah. Yeah.

01:27:15.710 --> 01:27:17.575
l was downstairs when l called you.

01:27:18.313 --> 01:27:21.282
-l know.
-You weren't gonna say anything?

01:27:21.550 --> 01:27:23.313
-No.
-Why not?

01:27:24.219 --> 01:27:26.949
-l didn't want to....
-Embarrass me.

01:27:27.122 --> 01:27:30.250
-Some cousin of that.
-Oh, God.

01:27:36.998 --> 01:27:39.398
You look good. You look rested.

01:27:39.568 --> 01:27:42.765
Although everyone l know looks
rested. George, help me out.

01:27:43.505 --> 01:27:44.938
-With?
-You said it.

01:27:45.106 --> 01:27:49.338
''Ever wish you could delete everything
you said as soon as you'd said it?''

01:27:49.511 --> 01:27:52.947
l thought it was strange,
but lately all l do is hear myself...

01:27:53.114 --> 01:27:57.073
...being so weak and whiny and needy
that l wish l could delete every--

01:27:58.253 --> 01:28:00.687
l think the answer to that
is to stop talking.

01:28:00.855 --> 01:28:03.153
Deny a voice to what's falling apart.

01:28:03.325 --> 01:28:07.887
No lip service, that's my advice to you.
Which l think l got from you.

01:28:08.063 --> 01:28:11.089
Now, l'm sorry to handle you
and the situation like this.

01:28:11.266 --> 01:28:13.598
lt was just an impulse.
l'm gonna let go now.

01:28:14.603 --> 01:28:16.400
Please don't hit me.

01:28:31.987 --> 01:28:33.147
Hey.

01:28:33.555 --> 01:28:35.113
Yeah?

01:28:35.790 --> 01:28:37.451
How much?

01:28:37.626 --> 01:28:39.423
How do you feel?

01:28:43.131 --> 01:28:45.691
Yeah, sure. Now.

01:28:47.068 --> 01:28:49.229
Can l bring a friend?

01:28:49.504 --> 01:28:51.870
All right. See you soon.

01:28:53.975 --> 01:28:55.875
She had the baby.

01:28:57.345 --> 01:28:59.313
l'm gonna head over there.

01:29:00.815 --> 01:29:01.873
You wanna come?

01:29:05.320 --> 01:29:07.754
No, no. l'll just....

01:29:08.690 --> 01:29:12.786
l don't wanna be in the way.
And then l'd just feel like....

01:29:13.695 --> 01:29:15.830
Sure, okay, thanks.

01:29:16.498 --> 01:29:18.193
Sweetie.

01:29:25.206 --> 01:29:27.731
-Hi, boss.
-Hey.

01:29:28.443 --> 01:29:30.468
You are...?

01:29:30.912 --> 01:29:33.005
This is Lisa.

01:29:33.181 --> 01:29:35.206
Annie's told us about you both.

01:29:37.619 --> 01:29:40.144
-l'm George Madison.
-Good to see you, George.

01:29:40.321 --> 01:29:41.879
-Hi, George.
-Congratulations.

01:29:42.057 --> 01:29:44.252
Lisa. Lisa Jorgenson.
Nice to meet you.

01:29:44.492 --> 01:29:46.756
Thanks, you guys. Dad.

01:29:46.928 --> 01:29:51.797
Remember, there are a lot of TV shows
with single-mom heroines. Okay?

01:29:51.966 --> 01:29:54.901
l'm fine. lt's fine.
Everybody's healthy.

01:29:55.070 --> 01:29:57.538
That's it. That's it, right?

01:29:58.306 --> 01:29:59.898
Modern times.

01:30:00.075 --> 01:30:01.406
l'm very happy.

01:30:01.576 --> 01:30:03.567
l know.

01:30:04.512 --> 01:30:05.604
lt's killing him.

01:30:09.217 --> 01:30:11.981
So glad to meet you finally.

01:30:12.153 --> 01:30:13.814
Oh, yeah.

01:30:15.156 --> 01:30:17.317
-Gee whiz!
-Yeah.

01:30:17.659 --> 01:30:18.921
Big boy.

01:30:19.427 --> 01:30:21.691
Ten pounds 1 0.

01:30:22.163 --> 01:30:23.494
And l'm three days early.

01:30:24.799 --> 01:30:25.891
Are you exhausted?

01:30:27.068 --> 01:30:28.467
l'm slaphappy.

01:30:32.140 --> 01:30:34.608
World's luckiest baby.

01:30:37.579 --> 01:30:40.514
Leave it to boss
to say the great thing.

01:30:41.416 --> 01:30:43.077
Excuse me.

01:30:44.486 --> 01:30:45.510
Hello?

01:30:46.454 --> 01:30:48.422
Oh, hi.

01:30:48.590 --> 01:30:51.354
You're here.
You're just a couple of doors down.

01:30:51.526 --> 01:30:55.257
Ask for Double Digit's room,
that's what we're calling him for now.

01:30:55.430 --> 01:30:56.692
Okay.

01:30:57.899 --> 01:30:59.833
Bubba!

01:31:01.469 --> 01:31:02.629
Yeah, that's him.

01:31:02.804 --> 01:31:04.863
Okay, l'll see you soon.

01:31:05.039 --> 01:31:06.904
Hey, buddy.

01:31:07.308 --> 01:31:09.105
Get ready to meet your daddy.

01:31:11.379 --> 01:31:13.540
We'll grab some coffee.
You want anything?

01:31:13.882 --> 01:31:15.941
Oh, thank you, no.

01:31:22.257 --> 01:31:24.987
No. No.

01:31:27.395 --> 01:31:30.330
You wore your suit!

01:31:33.868 --> 01:31:35.096
-Al.
-Oh, hey.

01:31:35.270 --> 01:31:39.001
Congratulations on
the birth of your baby.

01:31:41.776 --> 01:31:43.744
lt's good of you to come,
Mr. Madison.

01:31:44.646 --> 01:31:47.638
-Boy or a girl?
-Boy.

01:31:50.752 --> 01:31:53.516
Maybe he'll meet somebody
in the nursery.

01:31:55.223 --> 01:31:58.158
l just wanted to drop this off...

01:31:58.326 --> 01:32:02.820
...and tell you not to worry
about your job. ln any way.

01:32:02.997 --> 01:32:05.864
Oh, my God, that's great to hear.
Thank you.

01:32:09.537 --> 01:32:11.562
-You okay?
-Tops.

01:32:12.240 --> 01:32:14.538
l thought you might be here.

01:32:15.076 --> 01:32:16.737
Would you...

01:32:17.245 --> 01:32:20.408
...like to talk? Go over anything?
Any new thoughts?

01:32:22.050 --> 01:32:23.517
No, not yet.

01:32:24.285 --> 01:32:25.843
You're thinking things out.

01:32:26.020 --> 01:32:30.514
Not at this precise moment.
l'm on a break.

01:32:30.925 --> 01:32:34.190
Okay, Gidge. Fine.

01:32:43.571 --> 01:32:47.098
-You a relative of Annie's?
-Oh, no, l'm a friend of--

01:32:47.275 --> 01:32:50.472
How you doing? l'm Al.
l'm the baby's father.

01:32:50.645 --> 01:32:52.135
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

01:32:52.580 --> 01:32:56.914
Okay, Al, let me tell you all there is
to know about raising a kid.

01:32:57.619 --> 01:32:59.587
Do not beat yourself
over the head...

01:32:59.754 --> 01:33:03.622
...with any notions that
someone else is doing it right.

01:33:03.791 --> 01:33:07.056
Yeah, well, actually, my mom
and pop, they did it right.

01:33:07.228 --> 01:33:09.128
Yours too, right, Annie?

01:33:09.797 --> 01:33:10.821
Yeah.

01:33:13.167 --> 01:33:15.294
Mine too. Sorry.

01:33:19.507 --> 01:33:22.067
Okay. Nice visit.

01:33:22.644 --> 01:33:25.545
Bye, all. Love you, son.

01:33:25.980 --> 01:33:27.140
Good night.

01:33:27.315 --> 01:33:31.411
Awfully glad l came by,
and happy parenting.

01:33:34.589 --> 01:33:37.149
Awfully glad l came by.

01:33:38.760 --> 01:33:40.387
Boss?

01:33:40.561 --> 01:33:43.121
When he walked in,
you didn't think that...?

01:33:43.298 --> 01:33:46.267
Oh, you poor guy!

01:33:47.568 --> 01:33:49.729
Oh, my God.

01:33:51.873 --> 01:33:54.000
l'm gonna do something...

01:33:54.542 --> 01:33:57.943
...so you just record it.
lt's the red button.

01:33:58.613 --> 01:34:01.104
l gotta say something to you.

01:34:01.282 --> 01:34:02.476
To the two of you.

01:34:05.586 --> 01:34:07.451
Okay.

01:34:09.557 --> 01:34:12.856
l don't want you to think that
the reason we're not married...

01:34:13.027 --> 01:34:16.190
...is because l think anything
of anyone else.

01:34:16.798 --> 01:34:19.562
lt's because l'm 40 years old
and l'm a failure.

01:34:19.734 --> 01:34:21.861
l will kill you, you talk like that.

01:34:22.036 --> 01:34:26.336
l'll get work again, l know. l won't have
seniority because of what happened.

01:34:26.507 --> 01:34:28.099
l don't wanna get sidetracked.

01:34:28.276 --> 01:34:32.508
The reason that l never
talked marriage to you...

01:34:32.780 --> 01:34:37.911
...is because l couldn't stand
to see you, the princess of worry...

01:34:38.086 --> 01:34:41.681
...weighted down by me
and my limited prospects.

01:34:41.856 --> 01:34:43.585
Because l get your worry, Annie.

01:34:44.158 --> 01:34:47.924
l know a lot of people think that's
a bad thing about you. But l know...

01:34:48.196 --> 01:34:51.927
...that it's because you have a great
big heart, and l love you for it!

01:34:52.100 --> 01:34:53.795
You know? And then...

01:34:53.968 --> 01:34:58.496
...l started to worry, all right?
About what would happen to you...

01:35:00.141 --> 01:35:02.166
...and this little hulk...

01:35:03.544 --> 01:35:06.377
...if you guys wound up
with someone who....

01:35:07.248 --> 01:35:09.682
Who thought that your worry was...

01:35:10.785 --> 01:35:12.150
-...you know....
-Neurotic?

01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:14.845
Right, yeah.
Somebody who didn't get you.

01:35:15.023 --> 01:35:17.457
Who wanted you to feel bad
about yourself.

01:35:17.625 --> 01:35:21.391
Wanted to make you be more normal
or wanted you to change...

01:35:21.562 --> 01:35:25.931
...or like yourself more.
Who didn't love all of it, Annie.

01:35:26.100 --> 01:35:28.864
Who didn't wanna
leave great enough alone.

01:35:30.471 --> 01:35:33.406
And l thought that l....

01:35:34.375 --> 01:35:36.206
l could do that for you.

01:35:36.911 --> 01:35:39.311
That could be a legitimate...

01:35:39.914 --> 01:35:42.781
...function for me in your life.

01:35:46.788 --> 01:35:48.016
So that allows me...

01:35:48.356 --> 01:35:51.052
-Oh, my God.
-... to propose to you...

01:35:52.193 --> 01:35:54.354
...that we get married.
l wanna marry you.

01:35:56.497 --> 01:35:58.260
Oh, Al!

01:36:02.336 --> 01:36:03.826
Wait.

01:36:04.572 --> 01:36:07.564
-Be careful.
-l'm crushing him.

01:36:09.610 --> 01:36:11.271
Did you get it?

01:36:12.380 --> 01:36:15.008
-Oh, my God. l got so caught--
-You didn't get it?

01:36:15.349 --> 01:36:16.373
No--

01:36:16.551 --> 01:36:18.178
-He didn't get it.
-He didn't--?

01:36:18.352 --> 01:36:20.047
You didn't get it?!

01:36:20.221 --> 01:36:21.518
Oh, my God!

01:36:21.789 --> 01:36:22.915
You didn't get it?!

01:36:23.458 --> 01:36:25.949
l'm so sorry! Oh, my God!
l can't tell you how--

01:36:26.127 --> 01:36:28.823
-Oh, no!
-l don't know what to say.

01:36:28.996 --> 01:36:32.295
-Okay, come on, we'll do it again.
-l can't do it again!

01:36:32.467 --> 01:36:33.627
-What's your name?
-Al.

01:36:33.801 --> 01:36:35.666
Al. Okay. You'll record it.

01:36:35.837 --> 01:36:37.828
l don't know what l said!
Who knows?

01:36:38.005 --> 01:36:41.907
We just have to think and we'll piece
this thing together. Right away.

01:36:42.076 --> 01:36:43.703
You were sitting. So sit down.

01:36:44.345 --> 01:36:48.179
Okay. You told her that
you didn't want her to think that....

01:36:48.349 --> 01:36:51.341
l don't want you to think
the reason we're not married...

01:36:51.519 --> 01:36:54.044
...is because l feel anything
for anybody else.

01:36:54.388 --> 01:36:55.412
Exactly! Yes, yes!

01:36:55.590 --> 01:36:58.650
You said you had no prospects.
You used the word ''failure.''

01:36:58.826 --> 01:37:01.226
l won't saddle you with
a 40-year-old failure.

01:37:01.395 --> 01:37:03.522
Annie, you said, ''l'll kill you--''

01:37:03.698 --> 01:37:06.292
l'll kill--
l'll kill you if you talk like that!

01:37:06.467 --> 01:37:08.264
l remember that.

01:37:08.436 --> 01:37:10.904
You said you didn't want her
to end up with--

01:37:11.072 --> 01:37:13.802
Someone who wanted her
to change what she couldn't.

01:37:13.975 --> 01:37:16.341
-Yes.
-Someone who didn't get me.

01:37:16.511 --> 01:37:19.412
-There was that whole list.
-He was worried about you.

01:37:19.580 --> 01:37:23.311
Worried you'd be with somebody
who made you feel bad about yourself.

01:37:23.484 --> 01:37:26.920
Who wanted you to like yourself
in a different way.

01:37:28.556 --> 01:37:30.751
Who didn't love you the right way.

01:37:31.626 --> 01:37:33.093
Protecting her from that...

01:37:33.261 --> 01:37:37.061
...appreciating her the way you do
was a legitimate function for you.

01:37:37.231 --> 01:37:38.721
Wow, l said that?

01:37:38.900 --> 01:37:40.959
l feel like you're all proposing to me.

01:37:41.135 --> 01:37:43.160
Then l asked you to marry me.

01:37:43.337 --> 01:37:47.034
No! No. What you said was:

01:37:47.208 --> 01:37:50.177
''l propose to you
that we get married.''

01:37:52.079 --> 01:37:54.843
-l propose to you that we get married.
-That's it.

01:37:55.016 --> 01:37:58.452
-And then you called him ''little hulk.''
-Yes.

01:37:58.619 --> 01:38:01.213
Which, for some reason,
is my favorite thing.

01:38:01.389 --> 01:38:03.653
Look at this guy.

01:38:08.329 --> 01:38:10.229
l love you so much, Al.

01:38:33.020 --> 01:38:35.989
l'm just gonna wait here
for my bus.

01:38:36.157 --> 01:38:38.182
l'll wait with you.

01:38:38.359 --> 01:38:41.385
Okay, good. Thanks.

01:38:47.635 --> 01:38:49.432
Don't you miss them already?

01:38:51.038 --> 01:38:52.938
l'm okay.

01:38:54.308 --> 01:38:57.675
Don't you think that what he said
applies to so many--?

01:39:05.286 --> 01:39:08.278
Well, take care.

01:39:08.456 --> 01:39:11.152
Yeah. You too.

01:39:11.659 --> 01:39:12.683
You too.

01:39:16.631 --> 01:39:18.622
Can't catch a break!

01:39:40.221 --> 01:39:41.848
George!

01:39:42.556 --> 01:39:43.614
George!

01:39:44.158 --> 01:39:46.388
What is wrong with you?

01:39:47.061 --> 01:39:48.585
What?

01:39:49.530 --> 01:39:53.899
What? l saw you.
You were shouting and all crazy.

01:39:54.068 --> 01:39:56.059
No, l--

01:39:56.704 --> 01:39:59.867
l just-- lt was weird
that you were off so fast.

01:40:00.041 --> 01:40:03.704
Well, l can wait for the next bus.

01:40:04.178 --> 01:40:05.645
You just charged off.

01:40:06.881 --> 01:40:09.850
Okay. Well, good.

01:40:10.017 --> 01:40:14.954
Well, you know, that's--
We should have plenty of time now.

01:40:15.589 --> 01:40:17.420
We'll--

01:40:18.893 --> 01:40:20.520
What is this?

01:40:20.695 --> 01:40:23.664
l think this is the opposite
of a bus strike.

01:40:28.002 --> 01:40:30.197
So won't Matty be worried?

01:40:34.108 --> 01:40:36.941
l didn't tell you we're
not living together right now?

01:40:37.478 --> 01:40:38.945
No, l would have remembered.

01:40:39.513 --> 01:40:41.913
Can you give us two seconds?
lt's important.

01:40:42.083 --> 01:40:44.313
-No problem, pal.
-Okay.

01:40:44.685 --> 01:40:45.947
What?

01:40:46.954 --> 01:40:50.720
We're still working on things,
but from a different slant.

01:40:50.891 --> 01:40:54.918
He's back tomorrow. He's throwing me
a belated birthday party tomorrow night.

01:40:55.096 --> 01:40:56.120
He's going all out.

01:40:56.364 --> 01:40:58.025
Not my choice.

01:40:58.199 --> 01:41:00.895
But when you're in something,
you....

01:41:01.402 --> 01:41:04.997
You gotta give it everything you have.
Else, what are you doing?

01:41:06.040 --> 01:41:07.200
Right.

01:41:09.677 --> 01:41:11.577
Oh, man.

01:41:16.851 --> 01:41:19.046
Can l come to your party?

01:41:19.387 --> 01:41:20.752
Can l come to your party?

01:41:22.990 --> 01:41:24.480
Sure.

01:41:25.126 --> 01:41:26.889
Of course.

01:41:28.729 --> 01:41:29.923
When was your birthday?

01:41:31.866 --> 01:41:33.299
lt was tonight.

01:41:35.603 --> 01:41:36.968
Of course it is.

01:41:40.941 --> 01:41:42.533
Happy birthday.

01:41:42.710 --> 01:41:44.234
Thank you.

01:42:00.528 --> 01:42:01.961
Father.

01:42:08.502 --> 01:42:09.969
George.

01:42:10.137 --> 01:42:12.662
l think l figured it out.
l don't wanna talk now.

01:42:13.707 --> 01:42:16.972
Well, could you give me
some indication?

01:42:17.144 --> 01:42:18.702
Tomorrow.

01:42:21.582 --> 01:42:22.981
l....

01:42:23.384 --> 01:42:25.944
l love you too. Tomorrow.

01:42:45.239 --> 01:42:47.503
-Going to the party, George?
-Not yet.

01:42:49.977 --> 01:42:55.210
Just a minute, son. The lawyers are
taking a break. Leave your stuff.

01:42:55.382 --> 01:42:57.373
Try the coffee shop on the corner.

01:42:57.551 --> 01:43:00.418
Get me that list
of non-extradition countries.

01:43:00.588 --> 01:43:02.579
The fruit salad's very good there.

01:43:09.697 --> 01:43:13.497
-Please sit.
-No, l can't. l have to get someplace.

01:43:14.068 --> 01:43:15.262
You look....

01:43:15.436 --> 01:43:17.700
Great? l'm shooting for great tonight.

01:43:19.306 --> 01:43:20.500
You look great.

01:43:21.108 --> 01:43:25.704
l know you want the bottom line, but
are you interested in my reasoning?

01:43:25.880 --> 01:43:28.542
Yes. Of course.

01:43:29.149 --> 01:43:32.016
First thing, and it was
an all-nighter getting there...

01:43:32.186 --> 01:43:36.020
...but same as in anything, the answer
starts with the right question.

01:43:36.190 --> 01:43:39.387
And the question here wasn't
whether l go to jail or you do.

01:43:39.560 --> 01:43:41.323
That was not the question.

01:43:41.495 --> 01:43:42.757
-lt wasn't?
-No.

01:43:42.930 --> 01:43:46.331
No. The question was,
will l go to jail for three years...

01:43:46.500 --> 01:43:51.199
...or will l live for 25 years feeling
awful because of your being in jail?

01:43:51.972 --> 01:43:53.564
Very good.

01:43:53.741 --> 01:43:57.575
So l went over different scenarios
to get varying perspectives.

01:43:57.745 --> 01:44:00.714
lf l had children,
l wouldn't consider going to jail.

01:44:01.115 --> 01:44:02.878
-But you don't.
-Right.

01:44:03.050 --> 01:44:04.074
Right.

01:44:04.251 --> 01:44:08.551
Or if l had someone crucial
to the life l want for myself...

01:44:08.722 --> 01:44:10.815
...it would be perverse...

01:44:10.991 --> 01:44:15.928
...some denunciation of the experience
of life itself if l gave that up.

01:44:16.397 --> 01:44:20.265
Well, that is an extreme
point of view.

01:44:20.901 --> 01:44:22.459
Do you have such a person?

01:44:22.636 --> 01:44:27.300
l don't know. But l'm going upstairs
to somehow find out.

01:44:27.474 --> 01:44:31.308
There's a party. She's up there.

01:44:31.512 --> 01:44:32.706
There's another guy.

01:44:32.880 --> 01:44:36.338
You mean she may be unavailable.

01:44:36.517 --> 01:44:38.417
l can't think that way right now.

01:44:38.586 --> 01:44:41.953
l'm going up there
and l'm taking my shot.

01:44:42.389 --> 01:44:44.653
lf l don't have a chance with her...

01:44:44.825 --> 01:44:46.690
...l will go to jail for you, Dad.

01:44:49.763 --> 01:44:53.699
But if l have any chance at all,
l can't.

01:44:56.704 --> 01:44:58.399
Wish me luck.

01:45:01.809 --> 01:45:03.510
Good luck.

01:45:13.454 --> 01:45:15.319
No unattached women
allowed tonight.

01:45:15.489 --> 01:45:19.619
One guy's bringing his sister.
A couple guys are bringing their moms.

01:45:20.027 --> 01:45:22.730
-How are you?
-l'm great.

01:45:22.796 --> 01:45:25.594
Okay, here we go. l want you to....

01:45:25.766 --> 01:45:28.200
Okay, we'll start right here.

01:45:29.136 --> 01:45:33.129
-Here, have a seat. Go on.
-Okay.

01:45:34.308 --> 01:45:36.538
-Here you go.
-Okay.

01:45:37.244 --> 01:45:39.109
lt's not a ring!

01:45:39.647 --> 01:45:42.639
-You don't have to look so relieved.
-No, no, l just--

01:45:42.816 --> 01:45:44.215
Okay.

01:45:44.385 --> 01:45:47.843
Now, maybe l don't
get on a knee for this, but....

01:45:49.256 --> 01:45:50.553
What are you doing?

01:45:51.025 --> 01:45:52.049
Go.

01:45:52.893 --> 01:45:55.259
The wrapping is lovely.

01:45:55.629 --> 01:45:58.029
-Hurry. No, you just--
-lt's so nice.

01:45:58.198 --> 01:46:01.656
No, but you can just rip it open.

01:46:06.407 --> 01:46:08.568
lt's gorgeous.

01:46:08.809 --> 01:46:11.471
But.... l mean, it's gorgeous.

01:46:11.645 --> 01:46:12.669
But what?

01:46:14.248 --> 01:46:17.081
l was thinking, when would l
wear something like this?

01:46:17.251 --> 01:46:20.618
l'll take you places.
Do you not get what this means?

01:46:21.221 --> 01:46:23.689
-You get the mean--
-That time is--

01:46:23.857 --> 01:46:25.290
No, it means we're engaged!

01:46:25.726 --> 01:46:27.557
-What?
-To be engaged.

01:46:28.529 --> 01:46:33.626
My father gave my mother a watch and
seven years later they were engaged.

01:46:37.071 --> 01:46:40.802
lt's beautiful. l mean, gorgeous.

01:46:42.876 --> 01:46:44.741
l don't know what to say. l--

01:46:44.912 --> 01:46:46.937
-You're blown away.
-l'm blown away.

01:46:47.114 --> 01:46:49.048
-Come on.
-l'm blown away!

01:46:49.216 --> 01:46:52.583
Yes! Come on. Now you're talking.

01:46:52.753 --> 01:46:54.721
Yes! Look at it.

01:46:55.255 --> 01:46:56.813
Sorry.

01:46:57.424 --> 01:46:59.085
Hi.

01:46:59.927 --> 01:47:00.951
You showed.

01:47:01.261 --> 01:47:04.389
Definitely. l'll wait out there.

01:47:04.631 --> 01:47:06.599
-Good to see you.
-Yeah.

01:47:06.767 --> 01:47:09.235
Thank you. And you.

01:47:09.970 --> 01:47:12.165
-Okay, we better get going.
-Okay.

01:47:12.339 --> 01:47:14.466
This is our first party as a couple.

01:47:14.641 --> 01:47:16.768
What were we all those other times?

01:47:16.944 --> 01:47:19.071
That's so cute.

01:47:19.346 --> 01:47:20.677
Right?

01:47:20.848 --> 01:47:23.612
Hey, Richie, what's going on?
Hey, Mrs. Hayes.

01:47:23.784 --> 01:47:26.412
l should find George.
He doesn't know anybody.

01:47:26.587 --> 01:47:27.611
l'll go with you.

01:47:27.788 --> 01:47:29.949
-Tori's mom wants to meet you.
-Right now?

01:47:30.124 --> 01:47:31.751
She's a fan.

01:47:34.328 --> 01:47:36.853
-l need to talk to you.
-Okay.

01:47:41.435 --> 01:47:43.130
Here, sit down.

01:47:45.939 --> 01:47:48.533
l got you a gift.

01:47:48.709 --> 01:47:50.370
Thanks.

01:48:18.705 --> 01:48:20.070
Thanks for not rushing me.

01:48:22.476 --> 01:48:23.909
Yeah.

01:48:35.422 --> 01:48:38.289
-This is only half the gift.
-Yeah?

01:48:38.458 --> 01:48:41.859
-lt doesn't work without the story.
-Okay.

01:48:42.796 --> 01:48:47.460
This stuff was invented
by this man in central Ohio...

01:48:47.634 --> 01:48:51.001
...as a white goo,
and he used it to...

01:48:51.738 --> 01:48:55.834
...remove soot off of wallpaper
from old-fashioned heating.

01:48:56.009 --> 01:49:00.742
So as gas and electric heating
came in, there was...

01:49:00.914 --> 01:49:04.145
...no longer a need
for the cleaning goo.

01:49:05.986 --> 01:49:07.681
So the guy was going under.

01:49:07.955 --> 01:49:10.651
But his sister-in-law was
a nursery school teacher--

01:49:10.824 --> 01:49:12.018
ls this a true story?

01:49:12.192 --> 01:49:16.424
The man's name was Joe McVicker.
His sister-in-law was Kay Zufall.

01:49:17.698 --> 01:49:19.063
Okay, l believe you.

01:49:19.867 --> 01:49:22.199
So Kay Zufall discovered...

01:49:22.369 --> 01:49:24.963
...that her little kids
liked squeezing the goo...

01:49:25.138 --> 01:49:28.904
...a lot more than hard modeling clay.
So she suggested to Joe...

01:49:29.176 --> 01:49:32.942
...that they color the stuff
and call it Play-Doh.

01:49:33.780 --> 01:49:35.338
Hey.

01:49:35.515 --> 01:49:37.244
Nice.

01:49:37.651 --> 01:49:39.414
So...

01:49:42.256 --> 01:49:45.692
...l have kept this for a long time...

01:49:45.859 --> 01:49:47.827
...as proof...

01:49:48.228 --> 01:49:51.595
...that we're all just
one small adjustment away...

01:49:51.765 --> 01:49:54.700
...from making our lives work.

01:50:03.877 --> 01:50:06.869
You can see why
l thought of this for you...

01:50:08.749 --> 01:50:10.580
...can't you?

01:50:14.187 --> 01:50:15.916
Yeah.

01:50:20.761 --> 01:50:21.785
Thanks.

01:50:25.165 --> 01:50:27.463
l'm gonna put it away because...

01:50:28.669 --> 01:50:32.867
...if anybody asks what it is, l could
never tell that story as well as you do.

01:50:47.988 --> 01:50:50.183
-Let us see the watch.
-Yeah.

01:50:50.357 --> 01:50:51.585
Oh, it's beautiful.

01:50:51.758 --> 01:50:53.350
-Matty gave you that?
-Yeah.

01:50:59.466 --> 01:51:01.593
Thank you for having me.

01:51:04.304 --> 01:51:05.931
Excuse me.

01:51:06.873 --> 01:51:09.034
l need to talk to you. Really.

01:51:09.209 --> 01:51:12.770
And that means l need to
get you out of this party.

01:51:12.946 --> 01:51:18.350
lf that feels out of the question to you,
there's probably nothing to talk about.

01:51:19.586 --> 01:51:21.884
Good night. Good night.

01:51:23.323 --> 01:51:27.054
l'm gonna go wait
out at the bus stop for the next...

01:51:27.527 --> 01:51:29.222
...1 0 to 1 5 hours.

01:51:30.464 --> 01:51:31.488
l'm kidding.

01:51:32.866 --> 01:51:35.096
l'll be out there for a while.

01:51:53.453 --> 01:51:54.852
-Hey.
-Hey.

01:51:55.022 --> 01:51:57.013
-Can l talk to you?
-Yeah, come here.

01:51:57.190 --> 01:51:58.521
Okay.

01:52:16.777 --> 01:52:22.272
Matty, l just think things
are moving a little too quickly.

01:52:24.217 --> 01:52:29.314
l almost got you this white silk
bathrobe that had, like, a thing that--

01:52:29.489 --> 01:52:31.389
l saw the watch and l got excited.

01:52:31.558 --> 01:52:34.925
l thought it was maybe
four or five months too early...

01:52:35.095 --> 01:52:38.189
...but if it was a mistake,
it was a mistake of enthusiasm.

01:52:38.365 --> 01:52:41.129
l'm gonna go hang out with George
for a little bit.

01:52:41.735 --> 01:52:44.602
-He wants to talk and l--
-Okay. Go ahead.

01:52:47.607 --> 01:52:49.575
Okay.

01:52:49.843 --> 01:52:53.677
But take into account that
l have the confidence to say that.

01:52:53.847 --> 01:52:55.678
Which is kind of a big deal.

01:52:56.950 --> 01:52:58.315
Okay.

01:52:58.485 --> 01:53:01.977
You understand? l'm saying yes, go,
but recognize the confidence.

01:53:02.155 --> 01:53:05.283
l get afraid you're missing
my confidence here.

01:53:05.625 --> 01:53:07.684
No, l get it.

01:53:08.095 --> 01:53:09.187
Good.

01:53:10.197 --> 01:53:12.961
Do you--? But-- l don't mean
to keep harping on it...

01:53:13.133 --> 01:53:16.625
...but l think that that's key
to any decision you make.

01:53:16.803 --> 01:53:19.237
That you're gonna have to....

01:53:29.416 --> 01:53:30.678
What did l do wrong?

01:53:31.118 --> 01:53:32.983
Nothing.

01:53:33.887 --> 01:53:37.345
You're great.
You're sweet, you're fun.

01:53:37.657 --> 01:53:38.851
You are.

01:53:42.629 --> 01:53:45.120
All the hot words.

01:53:55.175 --> 01:53:57.075
Talk to you later.

01:54:44.624 --> 01:54:45.750
You hungry?

01:54:46.126 --> 01:54:47.593
Always.

01:54:47.961 --> 01:54:50.759
-l have Annie's stuff.
-Okay.

01:55:13.720 --> 01:55:15.322
l just had a thought.

01:55:17.891 --> 01:55:21.486
Did you come down here
to tell me not to bother waiting?

01:55:27.467 --> 01:55:29.196
No.

01:55:39.846 --> 01:55:41.108
George.

01:55:43.350 --> 01:55:46.786
l thought you were this silly guy.

01:55:46.953 --> 01:55:49.444
Now it's like...

01:55:50.090 --> 01:55:52.991
...everything but you seems silly.

01:55:53.593 --> 01:55:56.153
-Who knows what l'm saying?
-l think l know.

01:55:56.429 --> 01:55:57.453
What?

01:55:58.064 --> 01:56:00.760
lt's just a thought l-- l might not be--

01:56:00.934 --> 01:56:03.300
-What?
-You love me too.

01:56:31.698 --> 01:56:34.098
Stop looking at me.

02:00:35.875 --> 02:00:38.309
<i>Tonight l'm in</i>

02:00:38.478 --> 02:00:42.812
<i>A romantic mood, yeah</i>
