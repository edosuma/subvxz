WEBVTT

00:02.133 --> 00:04.135
I'M THINKING WE PUT
THE TUB HERE,

00:04.135 --> 00:06.137
THAT WAY
YOU CAN TAKE A BATH,

00:06.137 --> 00:08.139
LOOK OUT THE WINDOW
AT THE TREES.

00:08.139 --> 00:10.441
BUT THAT MEANS WE HAVE TO MOVE
THE SINK HERE,

00:10.441 --> 00:13.614
BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN
GET TWO SINKS ON THAT WALL.

00:13.614 --> 00:16.347
OKAY.
OKAY, SO DO YOU WANT ME
TO MOVE THE TUB

00:16.347 --> 00:19.050
OR YOU WANT TO SHARE A SINK?

00:19.050 --> 00:21.652
I HAVE ONE OPINION,
AND THAT IS THAT

00:21.652 --> 00:23.654
I JUST WANT
A TUB DEEP ENOUGH

00:23.654 --> 00:26.297
THAT IT COVERS
MY KNEES AND BOOBS--

00:26.297 --> 00:28.629
KNEES AND BOOBS
AT THE SAME TIME.

00:28.629 --> 00:31.802
YEAH, I GOTTA GO. YOU'RE
USELESS. MWAH. LOVE YOU.

00:31.802 --> 00:33.804
THE DUDE'S BUILDING YOU
A DREAM HOUSE.

00:33.804 --> 00:36.067
I CAN'T READ
THESE STUPID THINGS.

00:36.067 --> 00:39.240
YOU JUST DON'T GIVE A CRAP.
I'M TAKING BABY DRUGS TO MAKE
MY UTERUS LESS HOSTILE,

00:39.240 --> 00:41.742
AND I DON'T KNOW,
IT MAKES MY EYES DRY,

00:41.742 --> 00:44.075
AND I HAVE TO SQUINT TO SEE,

00:44.075 --> 00:47.078
AND I DON'T REALLY CARE ENOUGH
ABOUT THE TUB/SINK RELATIONSHIP

00:47.078 --> 00:50.421
TO, YOU KNOW...
YOU SHOULD TALK
TO THAT HOT O.B.

00:50.421 --> 00:53.053
YOU ARE ALWAYS
DRUMMING UP REASONS

00:53.053 --> 00:55.055
TO TALK TO THAT HOT O.B.

00:55.055 --> 00:57.158
(Meredith) EVERYONE FIGURES
DOCTORS ARE

00:57.158 --> 00:59.230
THE MOST RESPONSIBLE PEOPLE
THEY KNOW.

00:59.230 --> 01:02.163
THEY HOLD LIVES IN THEIR HANDS.
THEY'RE NOT FLAKES.

01:02.163 --> 01:05.065
THEY DON'T LOOSE TRACK
OF IMPORTANT DETAILS

01:05.065 --> 01:08.339
OR MAKE
STUNNINGLY BAD JUDGMENT CALLS.

01:08.339 --> 01:10.341
'CAUSE THAT WOULD BE BAD,
RIGHT?

01:10.341 --> 01:11.842
OH, LOOK.
AWW.

01:11.842 --> 01:13.804
NICE SIZE,
GOOD-LOOKING PLACENTA.

01:13.804 --> 01:16.307
IS THAT AN ARM?
YEP.

01:16.307 --> 01:18.209
(Arizona and Mark) AWW.

01:18.209 --> 01:20.511
ALL GOOD. DID YOU
SCHEDULE AN AMNIO YET?

01:20.511 --> 01:23.154
UM...
WE DON'T NEED
AN AMNIO.

01:23.154 --> 01:25.286
UM... WE DON'T?

01:25.286 --> 01:28.519
OF COURSE WE DO.
WE'LL SET IT UP.
WHY DO WE NEED AN AMNIO?

01:28.519 --> 01:32.323
I CAN THINK
OF A HUNDRED REASONS WHY.
YOU WANT ME TO TAKE 'EM DOWN
ONE BY ONE OR ALL TOGETHER?

01:32.323 --> 01:35.496
HEY, HEY, HEY.
IT'S SO NICE
THAT THERE ARE THREE OF YOU.

01:35.496 --> 01:38.199
(pager beeps)
I GOTTA GO. DON'T LET HER SHOVE
A GIANT NEEDLE IN YOUR BELLY

01:38.199 --> 01:40.301
BEFORE WE DISCUSS THIS.
(sighs)

01:40.301 --> 01:42.603
IT'S NOT GIANT.
9 INCHES.

01:45.105 --> 01:46.607
(video game beeping)

01:46.607 --> 01:48.439
OKAY, SO I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT THIS,

01:48.439 --> 01:50.441
BUT WITH A CLINICAL TRIAL,
THE PAPERWORK NEVER ENDS.

01:50.441 --> 01:52.313
HAVE THERE BEEN ANY CHANGES

01:52.313 --> 01:55.146
TO YOUR MEMORY
IN THE LAST WEEK OR SO?

01:55.146 --> 01:57.148
OH, I DON'T--I DON'T THINK
IT'S WORSE.

01:57.148 --> 01:59.790
WENT TO SEE DR. KESTEN,
AND, UH, COULDN'T FIGURE OUT

01:59.790 --> 02:02.293
WHAT FLOOR HE'S ON, BUT THAT'S--
THAT'S ALWAYS THE CASE.

02:02.293 --> 02:04.295
WELL, THAT PLACE IS A MAZE.

02:04.295 --> 02:06.427
DID YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
OR WAS THAT SCHEDULED?

02:06.427 --> 02:08.429
NO, WELL, HE'S--HE'S THE ONE
WHO FIRST DIAGNOSED ME,

02:08.429 --> 02:11.702
AND I WAS KIND OF ANGRY
WHEN HE SAID IT WAS ALZHEIMER'S.

02:11.702 --> 02:13.764
I-I CALLED HIM A QUACK.
(laughs)

02:13.764 --> 02:16.407
I, UH, FIGURED
I SHOULD APOLOGIZE.

02:16.407 --> 02:18.769
WELL, I'M SURE
HE GETS THAT A LOT.

02:18.769 --> 02:21.242
HAVE THERE BEEN ANY CHANGES
IN YOUR SCHEDULE

02:21.242 --> 02:23.244
IN THE LAST WEEK OR SO?

02:23.244 --> 02:25.316
I-I DON'T WORK, AND, UM...

02:25.316 --> 02:27.618
I GET LOST ON THE WAY
TO THE POST OFFICE,

02:27.618 --> 02:29.720
SO I DON'T DO
SO MANY ERRANDS.

02:29.720 --> 02:31.922
SO HOW ABOUT YOUR SLEEPING
AND YOUR EATING?

02:31.922 --> 02:33.924
WELL, WE HAVE, UH,
BREAKFAST TOGETHER

02:33.924 --> 02:35.926
BEFORE THE BOYS LEAVE.
RIGHT.

02:35.926 --> 02:39.290
AND LUNCH...

02:39.290 --> 02:40.891
WELL, I--

02:40.891 --> 02:44.335
I'M NOT HOME TILL PRETTY LATE,
SO I-I DON'T KNOW...

02:44.335 --> 02:47.198
HALF A PEANUT BUTTER
AND BANANA SANDWICH.

02:47.198 --> 02:50.271
WELL, I MAKE ONE WHEN WE
GET HOME, AND WE SHARE IT.

02:50.271 --> 02:52.643
OKAY. AND, UH,
WHAT ABOUT THE DRUGS--

02:52.643 --> 02:54.775
ANY SIDE EFFECTS?

02:57.648 --> 03:00.180
NO.
OKAY.

03:00.180 --> 03:02.553
THE PINK ONES
MAKE YOU THIRSTY.

03:02.553 --> 03:04.755
(gasps) DRY MOUTH.
Y-YEAH.
RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.

03:04.755 --> 03:07.488
AND WATER HELPS WITH THAT?

03:10.921 --> 03:12.263
YEAH.

03:12.263 --> 03:16.196
OKAY. VERY GOOD.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.699
(people speaking indistinctly)

03:18.699 --> 03:21.372
RICKY--BIG DAY.

03:21.372 --> 03:23.374
BRING IT ON.

03:23.374 --> 03:26.407
IS THIS YOUR SISTER?
THIS IS MY GIRLFRIEND--JULIA.

03:26.407 --> 03:29.380
YOU'RE KIDDING. HE'S BEEN
TALKING ABOUT YOU FOR MONTHS.

03:29.380 --> 03:31.782
I FIGURED, IF THERE WAS EVER
A DAY TO TAKE OFF WORK,

03:31.782 --> 03:34.285
IT'S WHEN YOUR BOYFRIEND'S
GETTING NEW LUNGS.
(coughs)

03:34.285 --> 03:36.687
SMART. SHE WAITED
FOR THE REAL FUN.

03:36.687 --> 03:38.689
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S DO THIS.
WELL, YOUR NEW LUNGS

03:38.689 --> 03:41.352
SHOULD LEAVE PORTLAND
IN ABOUT TWO HOURS.

03:41.352 --> 03:43.454
YOU HAVEN'T TAKEN ANY OF
YOUR CYSTIC FIBROSIS MEDS

03:43.454 --> 03:46.397
SINCE LAST NIGHT, RIGHT?
NO FOOD, NO WATER,
NO DRUGS.

03:46.397 --> 03:48.399
(Lexie) GREAT. SO WE'LL
JUST DO ONE LAST WORKUP,

03:48.399 --> 03:50.931
AND THEN WE'LL GET YOU
TO THE O.R.
(Teddy) OH, AND, UH, JULIA,

03:50.931 --> 03:53.233
WRITE DOWN YOUR NUMBER, PLEASE,
AND GIVE IT TO DR. GREY.
WHY?

03:53.233 --> 03:55.266
WELL, SO WE CAN CALL YOU
WHEN RICKY'S IN SURGERY

03:55.266 --> 03:57.808
IF WE HAVE ANY NEWS.
(Ricky coughs)

03:57.808 --> 03:59.640
(elevator bell dings)

03:59.640 --> 04:02.713
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU PUT
IN AN APPLICATION TO THE F.D.A.?

04:02.713 --> 04:05.716
IT'S BEEN A WHILE, SIR.
WELL, IT WOULD HAVE TO BE,
BECAUSE IF YOU HAD

04:05.716 --> 04:07.718
ANY RECOLLECTION
OF WHAT'S INVOLVED,

04:07.718 --> 04:09.720
THEN YOU WOULDN'T
INTERRUPT ME

04:09.720 --> 04:12.423
IN THE MIDDLE OF COMPILING
357 PAGES OF AN APPLICATION.

04:12.423 --> 04:15.426
DO YOU KNOW HOW EASY IT IS
TO LOSE ONE PAGE OUT OF 357?

04:15.426 --> 04:18.429
IT'S GOTTA BE QUITE EASY.
THEY LOOK FOR REASONS
TO KILL A STUDY.

04:18.429 --> 04:21.432
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY CONSIDER
A GOOD REASON?
A MISSING--

04:21.432 --> 04:23.734
ONEMISSING PAGE.
NOW YOU'RE A SMART MAN, HUNT.

04:23.734 --> 04:26.266
YOU HAVE LEADERSHIP POTENTIAL,
MANAGEMENT POTENTIAL.

04:26.266 --> 04:29.269
I MEAN, I THINK
YOU SHY AWAY FROM THAT.
THAT MAY WELL BE, SIR.

04:29.269 --> 04:31.271
I MEAN, YOU CAN HANDLE
A V.I.P. PATIENT.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.774
I MEAN, IF YOU DON'T MENTION
THE CHIEF OF SURGERY,

04:33.774 --> 04:35.776
THEY WON'T ASK
FOR THE CHIEF OF SURGERY.

04:35.776 --> 04:38.278
(lowered voice)
DID YOU MENTION ME?
(lowered voice)
I THINK I DID, SIR.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.280
NOW WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

04:40.280 --> 04:43.283
DID YOU NOT KNOW
ABOUT MY APPLICATION?
I THINK I KNEW, SIR.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.285
THEN WHAT ON EARTH
WERE YOU THINKING?

04:45.285 --> 04:48.389
YOUR WIFE, SIR.
THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING.

04:48.389 --> 04:56.367
(sighs)

04:56.367 --> 04:58.369
(laughs)
JUST WHEN YOU THOUGHT
YOU WERE DONE,

04:58.369 --> 04:59.730
WE NEED MORE BLOOD.

04:59.730 --> 05:02.333
WELL, IF THERE'S ANY LEFT,
IT'S ALL YOURS.
WELL, DR. SHEPHERD

05:02.333 --> 05:05.436
IS GOING TO COME UP
AND TAKE A LOOK AT YOU,

05:05.436 --> 05:08.008
AND IF THESE LABS ARE CLEAN,
THEN WE'RE GONNA MOVE YOU

05:08.008 --> 05:10.381
UP TO THE O.R. FLOOR.
(woman) GOOD.

05:10.381 --> 05:12.513
HEY. LET'S KEEP
OUR FINGERS CROSSED

05:12.513 --> 05:15.516
AND HOPE THAT MOM GETS
THE GOOD STUFF, OKAY?
OKAY.

05:15.516 --> 05:17.848
HEY, KYLE.
WHAT'S THIS ON YOUR NECK?

05:17.848 --> 05:21.492
OH, THAT'S JUST MY BUMP.
IT DOESN'T HURT OR ANYTHING.

05:21.492 --> 05:23.494
WE'VE BEEN MEANING
TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT,

05:23.494 --> 05:26.357
BUT... WITH EVERYTHING
THAT'S BEEN GOING ON--

05:26.357 --> 05:30.100
I'M A FULL-TIME JOB.
NO, YOU'RE NOT, OKAY?
I SHOULD'VE CALLED.

05:30.100 --> 05:32.963
(Meredith) WELL, WE HAVE DOCTORS
COMING OUT OF OUR EARS HERE.

05:32.963 --> 05:35.406
SO I'LL HAVE SOMEONE
COME UP AND TAKE A LOOK.

05:35.406 --> 05:37.368
IT'S JUST ONE LESS THING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

05:37.368 --> 05:40.040
THANK YOU.
OKAY.

05:42.743 --> 05:44.845
I WAS IN THE CEREAL AISLE,

05:44.845 --> 05:47.378
AND I TRIPPED ON
ONE OF THOSE BIG DISPLAYS--

05:47.378 --> 05:50.350
FRUIT SPREADS
OR--OR SOME NONSENSE--

05:50.350 --> 05:52.983
AND THE WHOLE THING
CAME DOWN.

05:52.983 --> 05:55.526
LIDO AND AN EPI, PLEASE.
5-0 PROLENE.
(woman) OKAY. EXCUSE ME.

05:55.526 --> 05:57.828
OH, IT'S A CUT, MARK.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SHOW OFF.

05:57.828 --> 06:01.131
YOU CAN GIVE ME A COUPLE OF
BAND-AIDS AND BE ON YOUR WAY.

06:01.131 --> 06:04.134
YEAH, THAT'S NOT HOW
THIS IS GONNA GO.
YOU--YOU TRIPPED
ON THE DISPLAY

06:04.134 --> 06:07.037
OR YOU TRIPPED OVER YOUR FEET
AND FELL INTO THE THING OR--

06:07.037 --> 06:08.699
THE CHRONOLOGY
ESCAPES ME, RICHARD.

06:08.699 --> 06:11.872
I WAS MORE FOCUSED ON THE FACT
THAT THERE WAS JAM

06:11.872 --> 06:14.775
AND--AND--AND SHARD GLASS
ALL OVER MY COAT AND MY PANTS

06:14.775 --> 06:16.777
AND THE PANTS OF THE STORE
MANAGER, WHO WOULD NOT

06:16.777 --> 06:19.480
LEAVE ME ALONE UNTIL HE PACKED
ME AWAY INTO AN AMBULANCE.

06:19.480 --> 06:23.514
OH! YOU KNOW, THIS WHOLE THING
IS JUST RIDICULOUS!

06:23.514 --> 06:25.556
THIS IS TWICE, HONEY.
I MEAN, YOUR WRIST--

06:25.556 --> 06:28.118
IT'S THOSE SHOES. NOW THEY ARE
SUPPOSED TO TONE YOUR DERRIERE,

06:28.118 --> 06:30.461
BUT I CANNOT FEEL THE GROUND
WHEN I WALK ON THEM.

06:30.461 --> 06:33.794
I AM GOING TO THROW THEM AWAY.
IF SOMEBODY WOULD JUST GIVE ME

06:33.794 --> 06:36.467
A COUPLE OF BAND-AIDS,
I CAN BE ON MY WAY.

06:36.467 --> 06:38.499
YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
NOW IF YOU MAKE
A BIG FUSS ABOUT THIS--

06:38.499 --> 06:40.531
MRS. WEBBER.

06:40.531 --> 06:42.973
HMM?
I'M ABOUT TO PUT
A NEEDLE IN YOUR FACE.

06:42.973 --> 06:45.736
I'D BE EXTREMELY GRATEFUL
IF YOU'D STOP MOVING.

06:45.736 --> 06:46.907
MM.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.479
(whimpers)

06:48.479 --> 06:49.980
(coughs)

06:49.980 --> 06:52.142
DID THEY COME BY
WITH THE FORMS?

06:52.142 --> 06:53.844
I THINK I SIGNED
200 OF THEM.

06:53.844 --> 06:57.448
(coughing)
(Jackson) THAT SOUNDS
ABOUT RIGHT. YOU JUST--

06:57.448 --> 06:59.450
YOU JUST GAVE US
YOUR FIRSTBORN.

06:59.450 --> 07:02.453
YOU NEED A DRINK OF WATER,
JULIA?
(coughing)
JUST ASTHMA. SORRY.

07:02.453 --> 07:05.596
NOTHING BRINGS PEOPLE TOGETHER
LIKE RESPIRATORY DISORDERS.

07:05.596 --> 07:07.458
MM. ROMANTIC.

07:07.458 --> 07:08.729
(spritzes)

07:08.729 --> 07:10.661
DORNASE.

07:10.661 --> 07:12.202
IT'S MINE.

07:12.202 --> 07:14.865
IT HAS JULIA'S NAME ON IT.

07:14.865 --> 07:17.538
RICK, WHY IS SHE
ON DORNASE?
(Julia) I'M GONNA GO.

07:17.538 --> 07:19.770
WAIT, JULIA, DO YOU--
YOU HAVE CYSTIC FIBROSIS?
GO.

07:19.770 --> 07:23.213
NO, WAIT A MINUTE. OKAY.
NOBODY'S GOING ANYWHERE.
(Jackson)
DO YOU KNOW HOW DANGEROUS

07:23.213 --> 07:25.746
CYSTIC FIBROSIS PATIENTS ARE
TO EACH OTHER?
WE KNOW.

07:25.746 --> 07:28.549
(Lexie) YOUR DISEASE
ISN'T CONTAGIOUS TO ANYBODY

07:28.549 --> 07:30.551
IN THE GENERAL POPULATION.
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU CAN'T DATE.

07:30.551 --> 07:33.624
YOU JUST CAN'T--
YOU CAN'T DATE EACH OTHER.
YOU CAN INFECT EACH OTHER
WITH BACTERIA

07:33.624 --> 07:36.627
THERE'S NO WAY
YOU CAN FIGHT.
WE KNOW! (coughs)

07:36.627 --> 07:39.960
YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIMES
WE'VE HEARD THE WARNINGS?

07:39.960 --> 07:42.462
NEVER GET CLOSER THAN 3 FEET

07:42.462 --> 07:44.034
FROM ANOTHER C.F. PATIENT.

07:44.034 --> 07:47.467
IT'S A DRAG. OKAY?
THERE'S NO QUESTION. I GET IT.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.139
NO, YOU DON'T.

07:49.139 --> 07:51.572
RICKY GETS IT.
NOBODY ELSE GETS IT.

07:51.572 --> 07:53.804
WE BOTH TRIED DATING.
PEOPLE CAN'T HANDLE IT.

07:53.804 --> 07:55.506
PEOPLE CRINGE AS SOON

07:55.506 --> 07:57.477
AS YOU START COUGHING,
LIKE YOU'RE GONNA KILL THEM.

07:57.477 --> 07:58.949
THIS IS DANGEROUS.

07:58.949 --> 08:00.781
(Ricky)
DEPRESSION IS DANGEROUS.

08:00.781 --> 08:03.013
LIVING BY YOURSELF...

08:03.013 --> 08:06.957
WITH NOBODY WHO UNDERSTANDS YOU,
THAT'S DANGEROUS.

08:06.957 --> 08:10.691
WE SPENT EIGHT YEARS
MAKING SMALL TALK

08:10.691 --> 08:15.526
ON OPPOSITE SIDES
OF A DOCTOR'S WAITING ROOM.

08:15.526 --> 08:17.598
AND ONE DAY WE DECIDED

08:17.598 --> 08:19.700
THAT LIFE WITH RISK

08:19.700 --> 08:22.873
IS BETTER
THAN NOT REALLY LIVING.

08:22.873 --> 08:25.836
WE DESERVE TO BE TOGETHER.

08:38.889 --> 08:41.151
KEPNER,
YOU'RE ON PEDS TODAY?
YEAH, SOME KID
ALREADY PUKED ON ME.

08:41.151 --> 08:44.094
OKAY, SO ONE OF MY PATIENT'S SON
HAS A LUMP ON HIS NECK.

08:44.094 --> 08:46.096
SO WOULD YOU
JUST DO A WORKUP ON HIM,

08:46.096 --> 08:48.829
AND IF IT'S ANYTHING,
KICK IT UP TO ROBBINS?

08:48.829 --> 08:51.632
FINE. YOU OWE ME ONE.
NO, I DON'T.

08:51.632 --> 08:54.264
I'M DOING YOU A FAVOR.
YOU OWE ME ONE.
YOU'RE DOING YOUR JOB.

08:54.264 --> 08:56.266
I OWE YOU
GRATITUDE AND RESPECT.

08:56.266 --> 08:59.640
I ALREADY HAD YOUR RESPECT.
(chuckles)

08:59.640 --> 09:01.742
UH, HMM.

09:04.775 --> 09:06.777
GIVE YANG
ALL YOUR PATIENTS TODAY.

09:06.777 --> 09:08.679
I HAVE
AN S.M.A. EMBOLECTOMY.

09:08.679 --> 09:10.150
WELL, I'LL TAKE
YOUR EMBOLECTOMY.

09:10.150 --> 09:12.152
YANG CAN TAKE THE REST.
YOU TAKE MY WIFE.

09:12.152 --> 09:14.925
(elevator bell dings)
NOW I WANT MY EMBOLECTOMY
EVEN MORE THAN I DID BEFORE.

09:14.925 --> 09:18.028
SHE'S FALLEN AND ENDED UP
IN MY E.R. TWICE.

09:18.028 --> 09:20.190
MAYBE IT'S AN INNER EAR THING,
AFFECTING HER BALANCE,

09:20.190 --> 09:22.192
MAYBE IT'S A PINCHED NERVE.
I DON'T KNOW.

09:22.192 --> 09:25.936
ALL I KNOW, IS YOU'RE GONNA RUN
EVERY TEST THAT HAS A NAME.

09:25.936 --> 09:28.699
I WAS LOOKING FORWARD
TO MY EMBOLECTOMY.

09:28.699 --> 09:31.842
EVERYONE'S UNHAPPY.

09:31.842 --> 09:33.844
(knock on door)
GET IN HERE.

09:33.844 --> 09:35.345
YOU PAGED ME?

09:35.345 --> 09:37.347
YEAH, I NEED YOU
TO CHECK MY EYES.

09:37.347 --> 09:39.349
I'M NOT AN EYE GUY.

09:39.349 --> 09:41.351
I DON'T KNOW
HOW THIS CRAP WORKS.

09:41.351 --> 09:43.353
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
I ALREADY DID THE CHART.

09:43.353 --> 09:45.355
I'M, LIKE, 20/25,
BUT I-I-I--

09:45.355 --> 09:47.658
NOW I NEED YOU TO LOOK
AT MY EYES THROUGH THIS THING.

09:47.658 --> 09:49.660
MAYBE IT'S GLAUCOMA.

09:49.660 --> 09:52.022
HEY, YOU COULD GET
A PRESCRIPTION FOR POT.

09:52.022 --> 09:54.965
ALL RIGHT. UH, LOOK UP.

09:54.965 --> 09:56.697
LOOK DOWN.

09:56.697 --> 09:59.069
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE GLAUCOMA.

09:59.069 --> 10:01.331
UH, YOUR CORNEA LOOKS FINE.

10:01.331 --> 10:03.834
GOOD.
YEAH, BUT YOU STILL
CAN'T READ THE CHART.

10:03.834 --> 10:05.335
YEAH, BUT IF I SQUINT...

10:05.335 --> 10:07.678
NORMAL PEOPLE DON'T SQUINT.
ALL RIGHT.

10:07.678 --> 10:10.681
READ THE CHART, LINE 8.

10:10.681 --> 10:12.713
NO SQUINTING.

10:12.713 --> 10:15.145
"D, C, P, I."

10:15.145 --> 10:17.748
YOU'RE BLIND.
SHUT UP.

10:17.748 --> 10:20.751
CAN YOU EVEN SEE ME?
YEAH, AND YOU LOOK LIKE
A REAL MORON.

10:20.751 --> 10:23.754
I NEED A REAL EYE DOCTOR.
CAN YOU EVEN SEE ENOUGH
TO OPERATE?

10:23.754 --> 10:25.656
WHEN I DO THE SQUINTING THING,
I SEE FINE.

10:25.656 --> 10:28.158
DON'T QUIT YOUR DAY JOB.
YEAH, WELL, YOU KEEP
SQUINTING LIKE THAT,

10:28.158 --> 10:30.661
AND YOU'RE GONNA GET CROW'S
FEET, BUT I'M GOOD AT PLASTICS.

10:30.661 --> 10:32.933
YOU WANT ME
TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT?

10:32.933 --> 10:34.935
I'VE LOST TOO MANY BABIES
IN MY TIME--

10:34.935 --> 10:36.636
ADDISON TERMINATED,
SLOAN DISAPPEARED.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.739
I'M NOT
LETTING IT HAPPEN AGAIN.

10:38.739 --> 10:41.641
I DON'T CARE
WHAT KIND OF BABY IT IS.
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU CAN'T BE GLIB ABOUT THIS.

10:41.641 --> 10:43.643
A SPECIAL NEEDS BABY
CAN BE A VERY SICK BABY.

10:43.643 --> 10:46.276
WE COULD BE TALKING ABOUT
A LIFETIME OF SURGERIES

10:46.276 --> 10:49.079
AND HOSPITAL STAYS AND PAIN.
IT'S NOT ALL HUGGING

10:49.079 --> 10:51.081
AND THE SPECIAL OLYMPICS.
AMNIOS COME WITH RISKS, TOO.

10:51.081 --> 10:52.823
ONE IN SOME
NOT-INSIGNIFICANT NUMBER

10:52.823 --> 10:55.025
RESULT IN MISCARRIAGE.
1 IN 300.

10:55.025 --> 10:56.727
SHE'S NOT 45.

10:56.727 --> 10:58.689
THE DOWN'S RATE ISN'T
ALL THAT HIGH IN WOMEN HER AGE.

10:58.689 --> 11:01.291
CAN--CAN WE HAVE--CAN WE
HAVE A MINUTE? CAN I JUST--

11:01.291 --> 11:03.133
JUST--I--
THERE'S NO PULLING
ANYBODY ASIDE.

11:03.133 --> 11:05.135
WE HAVE A RELATIONSHIP, MARK.

11:05.135 --> 11:08.138
PART OF THAT
DOESN'T INCLUDE YOU.
SHE'S CARRYING MY KID.

11:08.138 --> 11:11.802
ALL RIGHT, IF SHE GETS A MINUTE,
THEN I GET A MINUTE, TOO.
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
NO ONE GETS A MINUTE.

11:11.802 --> 11:14.845
I HAVE A PATIENT.
THE PATIENT GETS A MINUTE.
OH.

11:28.859 --> 11:31.792
I'VE GOT A FRIEND
WHO CAN'T SEE,

11:31.792 --> 11:35.065
AND, UH, SHE THINKS THAT MAYBE
HER, UH, FERTILITY MEDS--

11:35.065 --> 11:36.727
YOUR FRIEND?

11:36.727 --> 11:39.730
YOU THINK I'M MAKING IT UP?

11:39.730 --> 11:41.732
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR REASONS
TO TALK TO ME

11:41.732 --> 11:43.834
BECAUSE THE LAST TIME
WE SPOKE,

11:43.834 --> 11:45.836
YOU ASKED ME OUT,
AND I SAID NO.

11:45.836 --> 11:47.838
SO NOW YOU'RE TAKING
MY TEMPERATURE

11:47.838 --> 11:49.980
TO SEE
IF I WAS ACTUALLY BUSY

11:49.980 --> 11:51.982
OR JUST NOT INTERESTED.

11:51.982 --> 11:53.984
YOU CAN'T ASK ME OUT AGAIN,

11:53.984 --> 11:56.847
NOT AFTER WHAT YOU
PERCEIVED TO BE A REJECTION,

11:56.847 --> 11:59.750
BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH YOUR WHOLE
RAP IS ABOUT CONFIDENCE,

11:59.750 --> 12:01.792
YOU'RE ABOUT AS SELF-ASSURED
AS A CHIHUAHUA.

12:01.792 --> 12:03.794
YOUR FRIEND, UH,
SHE DOESN'T NEED MY HELP.

12:03.794 --> 12:06.296
IF SHE DID, SHE'D CALL ME.

12:06.296 --> 12:09.429
SO I SHOULD
JUST ASK YOU OUT AGAIN?

12:09.429 --> 12:12.803
IT'S A LOT SIMPLER,
DON'T YOU THINK?

12:12.803 --> 12:14.805
ARE YOU FREE FOR DINNER?

12:14.805 --> 12:17.237
NOPE. BUSY.

12:19.940 --> 12:21.942
WELL, AT FIRST I THOUGHT
IT WAS A BENIGN CYST,

12:21.942 --> 12:25.075
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE
IT'S PROBABLY A CYSTIC HYGROMA.

12:25.075 --> 12:27.978
WOW. THE TRACHEA'S
STARTING TO CLOSE OFF.

12:27.978 --> 12:29.880
WELL, I'LL MOVE
YOUR DIVERTICULECTOMY.

12:29.880 --> 12:31.882
OR MAYBE DR. STARK
HAS TIME FOR IT.

12:31.882 --> 12:34.754
DR. STARK HAS TIME FOR WHAT?
UH, I'VE GOT
A DIVERTICULECTOMY.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.756
WE'RE HOPING
THAT YOU COULD TAKE IT,

12:36.756 --> 12:38.758
'CAUSE THIS HYGROMA NEEDS
TO COME OUT RIGHT AWAY.

12:38.758 --> 12:42.092
OH, GOOD LORD.
WHY DID YOU WAIT SO LONG?

12:42.092 --> 12:45.095
THIS THING IS A TIME BOMB.
WE JUST SAW THE PATIENT
FOR THE FIRST TIME TODAY.

12:45.095 --> 12:48.768
WELL, SO WHAT, THE PARENTS
DON'T HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE?

12:48.768 --> 12:50.270
THEY DO.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.272
WELL, WHY DIDN'T THEY GET
THIS KID TO A DOCTOR?

12:52.272 --> 12:53.944
KYLE'S MOTHER
HAS ALZHEIMER'S.

12:53.944 --> 12:55.946
SHE WAS DIAGNOSED
A FEW MONTHS AGO,

12:55.946 --> 12:58.208
AND THE FATHER
HAS BEEN WORKING LIKE A DOG

12:58.208 --> 13:00.210
SO THEIR INSURANCE
DOESN'T LAPSE.

13:00.210 --> 13:02.953
AND KYLE'S TAKING CARE
OF HIS MOM

13:02.953 --> 13:04.784
AS MUCH AS ANYONE'S
TAKING CARE OF HIM.

13:04.784 --> 13:08.188
THEY'RE JUST UNDERWATER
RIGHT NOW.
YEAH, ALL RIGHT.
CALL PROTECTIVE SERVICES.

13:08.188 --> 13:12.062
WHAT?
AT LEAST ONE OF YOU HERE
UNDERSTOOD THAT, RIGHT?

13:12.062 --> 13:14.264
YOU CAN'T TAKE KYLE
AWAY FROM HIS PARENTS.

13:14.264 --> 13:18.068
YOU JUST TOLD ME THEY'RE NOT
CARING FOR THEIR SON.
THEY ARE DEALING

13:18.068 --> 13:22.032
WITH AN EXTRAORDINARY SET
OF CIRCUMSTANCES.
THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.
THAT'S WHY THE STATE

13:22.032 --> 13:24.835
SET UP A WHOLE DEPARTMENT
TO DEAL WITH THIS.

13:24.835 --> 13:26.837
YOU KNOW, I'VE GOT
THREE SPECIALISTS ON THEIR WAY

13:26.837 --> 13:29.980
IN HERE TO LOOK AT A TUMOR,
SO I NEED THIS ROOM.
DR. STARK--

13:29.980 --> 13:31.982
AND YOU'VE GOT
A SURGERY TO PERFORM,

13:31.982 --> 13:34.384
ASSUMING THE PATIENT'S AIRWAY
IS NOT ALREADY CLOSED.

13:34.384 --> 13:36.586
IF IT HAS, WELL,
HE'S PROBABLY DEAD, AND THEN,

13:36.586 --> 13:39.990
WELL, YEAH, NOBODY HAS TO
CALL ANYBODY, RIGHT?

13:50.530 --> 13:52.532
YOU HAVE TO CALL HIM OFF.

13:52.532 --> 13:54.534
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.
WE CAN CALL A SOCIAL WORKER,

13:54.534 --> 13:56.867
HAVE 'EM GO IN AND SAY HELLO,
ASK IF THEY NEED ANY HELP.

13:56.867 --> 13:59.339
IT'LL PLACATE HIM.
NO, BECAUSE ONCE
YOU'RE IN THE SYSTEM,

13:59.339 --> 14:00.911
IT'LL ONLY GET WORSE.

14:00.911 --> 14:03.173
YOU'RE REGISTERED AS A PARENT
WHO NEGLECTS HIS KID. IT'S OVER.

14:03.173 --> 14:05.515
YOU HAVE TO CALL HIM OFF.
HE'S MY BOSS.

14:05.515 --> 14:09.179
BELIEVE ME, I LIKE IT
WAY LESS THAN YOU DO.
THIS FAMILY JUST LOST
THE GROUND UNDER THEIR FEET.

14:09.179 --> 14:10.881
NO ONE LIKES THE IDEA

14:10.881 --> 14:13.383
OF A 10 YEAR OLD
TAKING CARE OF HIS MOTHER,

14:13.383 --> 14:15.886
BUT THEY'RE DOING
THE BEST THEY CAN.

14:15.886 --> 14:17.928
MAYBE DEREK'S DRUG
HELPS HER.

14:17.928 --> 14:19.930
OR SHE COULD GET THE PLACEBO,
AND IN 18 MONTHS,

14:19.930 --> 14:21.892
SHE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW
WHO KYLE IS.

14:21.892 --> 14:23.894
WE CAN'T LET THEIR LAST COUPLE
OF YEARS TOGETHER

14:23.894 --> 14:25.535
BECOME SOME NIGHTMARE
WHERE THEY'RE FIGHTING

14:25.535 --> 14:27.867
TO KEEP KYLE IN THEIR HOUSE.

14:27.867 --> 14:30.941
IT'S ENOUGH
OF A NIGHTMARE ALREADY.
WE'LL TALK TO HIM.
WELL, SO HE SHOOTS US DOWN.

14:30.941 --> 14:33.443
IT CAN'T HURT TO TRY, RIGHT?

14:33.443 --> 14:35.345
(all speaking indistinctly)

14:35.345 --> 14:38.048
YOU NEED ME TO TAKE
YOUR DIVERTICULECTOMY

14:38.048 --> 14:39.950
WHILE YOU REMOVE
THE BOY'S MASS, RIGHT?

14:39.950 --> 14:41.952
MY ASSISTANT KNOWS MY SCHEDULE
BETTER THAN ME.

14:41.952 --> 14:44.955
JUST CHECK WITH HER.
WE THINK CALLING PROTECTIVE
SERVICES IS A BAD IDEA.

14:44.955 --> 14:48.919
OH, UH, KYLE'S MOTHER MAY NOT
HAVE A LOT OF LUCID TIME.

14:48.919 --> 14:51.291
AND THESE YEARS
ARE GONNA BE DIFFICULT,

14:51.291 --> 14:54.094
BUT IT'S ALL THE FAMILY HAS,
AND SO PULLING THEM APART--
DO YOU KNOW

14:54.094 --> 14:56.566
WHEN PROTECTIVE SERVICES
PULLS FAMILIES APART?

14:56.566 --> 14:58.468
WHEN THE CHILDREN
ARE IN DANGER.

14:58.468 --> 15:00.200
WHEN THE CHILDREN AREN'T
IN DANGER, THEY GO AWAY.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.602
THEY DO SOMETHING ELSE.
BUT THEY CAN HAVE
A KNEE-JERK REACTION

15:02.602 --> 15:04.935
TO CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES--
WHAT,
YOU THINK THEY'RE IDIOTS?

15:04.935 --> 15:08.338
I AM SURE THAT THEY ARE NOT--
HEARTLESS WRETCHES?

15:08.338 --> 15:11.211
NO.
PEDIATRIC SURGEONS
CAN BE HEARTLESS WRETCHES.

15:11.211 --> 15:13.143
SOME WOULD ARGUE THAT
I'M A CASE IN POINT.

15:13.143 --> 15:15.115
BUT SOCIAL WORKERS,
ON THE OTHER HAND,

15:15.115 --> 15:16.947
ARE BLEEDING HEARTS,
ALL RIGHT?

15:16.947 --> 15:19.619
THEY'RE EARNING PEANUTS, THEY'RE
DOING THIS THANKLESS WORK,

15:19.619 --> 15:21.651
AND THEN THEY GET PAINTED
AS, WHAT, HOME WRECKERS?

15:21.651 --> 15:24.354
FOR SIMPLY FOR STEPPING IN
WHERE CHILDREN ARE BEING HARMED.

15:24.354 --> 15:26.356
YEAH, BUT THE BOY
IS NOT BEING HARMED.

15:26.356 --> 15:28.999
AND YOU'RE SURE ABOUT THAT,
RIGHT? YOU'RE 100% SURE?

15:28.999 --> 15:31.001
NO SHADOW OF A DOUBT THERE?

15:31.001 --> 15:33.663
AH. THAT MUST BE
A NICE FEELING, HUH?

15:33.663 --> 15:36.666
WHY DON'T YOU BE A GOOD EXAMPLE
FOR YOUR RESIDENTS

15:36.666 --> 15:38.708
AND MAKE THE CALL?

15:38.708 --> 15:40.370
MM.

15:40.370 --> 15:43.943
WHAT ARE YOU WRITING?

15:43.943 --> 15:45.445
DR. BAILEY?

15:45.445 --> 15:48.048
I'M WRITING ABOUT YOUR EARS.

15:48.048 --> 15:49.349
WHAT ABOUT THEM?

15:49.349 --> 15:51.351
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH 'EM.

15:51.351 --> 15:53.423
WELL, THEN
CAN I GO HOME NOW?

15:53.423 --> 15:55.055
(chuckles) NO, MA'AM.

15:55.055 --> 15:57.527
OH, WE ARE WASTING
EVERYONE'S TIME.

15:57.527 --> 16:00.190
I TRIPPED AT THE PHARMACY.
I HAVE FAULTY SHOES.

16:00.190 --> 16:04.294
I SHOULD NOT BE TRYING
TO TONE MY DERRIERE.

16:04.294 --> 16:07.137
THAT FLAVOR OF VANITY
IS UNBECOMING

16:07.137 --> 16:09.269
IN A WOMAN MY AGE.

16:09.269 --> 16:12.072
THE SUPERMARKET.
EXCUSE ME?

16:12.072 --> 16:15.175
YOU TRIPPED AT THE SUPERMARKET,
NOT THE PHARMACY.

16:15.175 --> 16:17.977
WHATEVER.
THE PHARMACY AISLE.

16:17.977 --> 16:20.480
I... (sighs)
NEEDED SOME COUGH SYRUP.

16:20.480 --> 16:24.114
YOU DON'T HAVE A COUGH.

16:24.114 --> 16:28.288
UH, CAN YOU BREATHE
INTO THIS TUBE FOR ME?

16:28.288 --> 16:31.091
I'VE HAD AN ALCOHOLIC HUSBAND
LONG ENOUGH.

16:31.091 --> 16:34.264
I KNOW A BREATHALYZER
WHEN I SEE ONE.

16:34.264 --> 16:36.126
JUST BREATHE INTO THE TUBE,
PLEASE.

16:36.126 --> 16:38.128
MY HUSBAND SENT YOU IN HERE

16:38.128 --> 16:41.201
TO TEST ME
FOR INNER EAR PROBLEMS

16:41.201 --> 16:43.273
AND BALANCE ISSUES.

16:43.273 --> 16:45.275
WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE
INNER EAR PROBLEMS.

16:45.275 --> 16:47.277
YOU DON'T HAVE BALANCE ISSUES.

16:47.277 --> 16:49.279
YOU ARE HAVING ACCIDENTS
AND YOU ARE INCONSISTENT

16:49.279 --> 16:51.281
WITH YOUR DESCRIPTION
OF THE ACCIDENTS.

16:51.281 --> 16:54.144
AND THOSE BEHAVIORS ARE
CONSISTENT WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE.

16:54.144 --> 16:56.186
SO I WILL RUN A TOX SCREEN,
I WOULD LIKE A LIST

16:56.186 --> 16:58.188
OF THE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS
IN YOUR POSSESSION,

16:58.188 --> 17:01.191
AND I NEED YOU TO BREATHE
INTO THIS TUBE.

17:01.191 --> 17:03.123
(ceo's "Come With Me" playing)

17:03.123 --> 17:04.794
THE MISCARRIAGE RATE
IS LOWER.

17:04.794 --> 17:06.796
IT'S EVEN LOWER
WITH WILDLY TALENTED O.B.s,

17:06.796 --> 17:08.798
AND WE HAVE
WILDLY TALENTED O.B.s.

17:08.798 --> 17:11.801
IT'S A RISK
NO MATTER WHO DOES IT.
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M TRYING TO EAT,

17:11.801 --> 17:13.803
WHICH IS MORE IMPORTANT
THAN IT'S EVER BEEN NOW,

17:13.803 --> 17:15.465
BECAUSE I'M AN INCUBATOR.

17:15.465 --> 17:17.467
OKAY, I KNOW
WHAT EACH OF YOU THINKS,

17:17.467 --> 17:19.469
I'M WEIGHING THE OPTIONS,
I WILL DECIDE.

17:19.469 --> 17:21.471
YOU'LL DECIDE?
YES, I'M THE TIEBREAKER.

17:21.471 --> 17:23.473
AND ANYHOW,
I HAVE THE BIGGER VOTE,

17:23.473 --> 17:26.476
BECAUSE AS WE'VE DISCUSSED,
I VOTE ON BEHALF OF THE BABY

17:26.476 --> 17:28.478
AND ON BEHALF OF THE--
VAGINA.

17:28.478 --> 17:31.481
YEAH.
RIGHT. THAT'S NOT
GONNA CUT IT, OKAY?

17:31.481 --> 17:33.483
WE'RE CO-PARENTING,
ALL OF US.

17:33.483 --> 17:35.185
THIS ISN'T A JOKE.

17:35.185 --> 17:37.187
IT'S NOT SOME CUTE ARRANGEMENT
WHERE YOU HUMOR ME

17:37.187 --> 17:40.090
AND USE ME FOR BABYSITTING
WHEN YOU WANT TO SEE A MOVIE.

17:40.090 --> 17:43.093
THIS IS MY CHILD.
WE'RE DOING THIS TOGETHER.

17:43.093 --> 17:46.196
YOU DON'T GET A BIGGER VOTE.
I'M A PARENT!

17:46.196 --> 17:48.668
♪♪♪

17:48.668 --> 17:51.471
OOH.

17:51.471 --> 17:53.303
DADDY'S MAD.

17:53.303 --> 17:55.305
SO HE SAYS
WE'RE ONLY GONNA HAVE

17:55.305 --> 17:57.307
ONE SINK IN THE BATHROOM,
LIKE HE'S HURTING ME.

17:57.307 --> 17:59.409
I MEAN,
WHY DO YOU NEED TWO?

17:59.409 --> 18:01.481
WELL, 'CAUSE MEN LEAVE
WADS OF TOOTHPASTE IN THE SINK.

18:01.481 --> 18:04.414
(mouth full) AND IF YOU HAVE
YOUR OWN SINK,

18:04.414 --> 18:07.217
YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOOK AT IT,
ALL DRIED AND CONGEALED...

18:07.217 --> 18:10.260
AND FILLED WITH
THEIR FOSSILIZED ORAL BACTERIA.

18:10.260 --> 18:12.522
I LEAVE TOOTHPASTE
IN THE SINK.

18:12.522 --> 18:15.525
ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO RINSE IT
EVERY TIMEYOU BRUSH?

18:15.525 --> 18:17.227
♪ COME WITH ME ♪

18:17.227 --> 18:20.430
NOBODY PARENTED YOU.
IT'S JUST TO BE EXPECTED.

18:20.430 --> 18:24.103
YOU'RE REALLY GONNA MOVE OUT
AND SELL YOUR HOUSE?
ARE YOU GONNA MISS ME?

18:24.103 --> 18:27.137
NO, I'M GONNA MISS HAVING
A CHEAP PLACE TO LIVE.

18:27.137 --> 18:29.139
YOU KNOW, I HAVE TROUBLE
SEEING FINE PRINT,

18:29.139 --> 18:31.341
BUT I CAN STILL SEE
YOUR PAWS ON MY FOOD.

18:31.341 --> 18:33.783
OOH.

18:33.783 --> 18:36.286
THE FACT THAT THE TWO OF YOU
HAVEN'T SWAPPED

18:36.286 --> 18:38.788
A LIFE-THREATENING INFECTION
ALREADY IS A MIRACLE.

18:38.788 --> 18:41.791
SO--SO MAYBE GOD HAS
A SOFT SPOT FOR YOU GUYS.

18:41.791 --> 18:43.793
BUT ONCE THIS TRANSPLANT
IS DONE,

18:43.793 --> 18:46.296
RICKY WILL BE
ON IMMUNOSUPPRESSANTS--

18:46.296 --> 18:48.258
TEN TIMES MORE LIKELY
TO GET AN INFECTION.

18:48.258 --> 18:50.260
LOTS OF THINGS
ARE RISKY. (coughs)

18:50.260 --> 18:53.132
THIS IS SUICIDE.
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.365
IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING
TO YOU. YOU'VE BEEN HAPPY.

18:55.365 --> 18:58.368
WE'VE BEEN SICK OUR WHOLE LIVES.
DON'T WE DESERVE SOME HAPPINESS?

18:58.368 --> 19:00.640
YOU'LL GET IT.
DON'T ACT LIKE IT'S EASY,

19:00.640 --> 19:03.313
WITH YOUR GORGEOUS EYES
AND YOUR WHITE COAT.

19:03.313 --> 19:05.315
IT'S INSULTING.

19:05.315 --> 19:08.318
I WON'T TELL YOU IT'S EASY.
IT'S NOT.

19:08.318 --> 19:10.520
BUT PEOPLE NEED THESE LUNGS.

19:10.520 --> 19:13.223
PEOPLE CAN USE THESE LUNGS
FOR DECADES--

19:13.223 --> 19:15.225
PARENTS WITH SMALL CHILDREN,

19:15.225 --> 19:18.157
TEENAGERS WHO ARE
JUST STARTING THEIR LIVES.

19:18.157 --> 19:20.159
IF THE TWO OF YOU
STAY TOGETHER,

19:20.159 --> 19:22.362
YOU COULD DESTROY THOSE LUNGS
WITHIN MONTHS.

19:22.362 --> 19:26.496
THESE LUNGS ARE A GIFT.
IF YOU SQUANDER IT--

19:26.496 --> 19:29.499
WHAT WE HAVE IS A GIFT.

19:32.472 --> 19:34.344
DO YOU LOVE SOMEONE?

19:34.344 --> 19:36.206
IF YOU DO...

19:36.206 --> 19:37.847
YOU KNOW.

19:37.847 --> 19:40.210
IT'S RARE

19:40.210 --> 19:42.282
AND IT'S A GIFT.

19:47.557 --> 19:51.421
END THE RELATIONSHIP,
OR YOU DON'T GET THE LUNGS.

20:06.606 --> 20:09.239
SO IT'S A CYST, AND IT'S
PUSHING ON KYLE'S AIRWAY,

20:09.239 --> 20:12.342
SO WE SHOULD REMOVE IT
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
BUT ONCE IT'S OUT,
HE'LL BE FINE.

20:12.342 --> 20:15.285
AND DR. ROBBINS IS GREAT.

20:15.285 --> 20:18.748
ALSO, A SOCIAL WORKER
MAY BE COMING BY

20:18.748 --> 20:22.292
JUST TO TALK TO YOU AND SEE
HOW THINGS HAVE BEEN GOING.

20:22.292 --> 20:24.324
IS THAT PART OF
THE CLINICAL TRIAL?

20:24.324 --> 20:26.796
NO. IT'S MORE OF
A FORMALITY THAN ANYTHING.

20:26.796 --> 20:29.299
YEAH, THANK YOU,
BUT, NO.
WELL, IF--

20:29.299 --> 20:31.961
IF IT'S PART OF THE EXPERIMENT,
WE SHOULD DO WHATEVER--

20:31.961 --> 20:34.564
NO, THEY'RE WORRIED
ABOUT KYLE, OKAY?

20:34.564 --> 20:37.236
IT'S NOT
PART OF THE EXPERIMENT.
WH-WHY?

20:37.236 --> 20:39.869
KY-KYLE'S FINE. YOU JUST SAID
THAT HE'S--HE'S--

20:39.869 --> 20:41.971
IF WE REFUSE, WHAT HAPPENS?
WAIT, WAIT.

20:41.971 --> 20:45.415
WH-WHAT'S WRONG WITH KYLE?
NO, THEY--THEY THINK THAT
WE'RE NOT TAKING CARE OF HIM.

20:45.415 --> 20:47.817
WHAT?
I'M FINE.
I DON'T NEED ANYTHING.

20:47.817 --> 20:50.280
WHAT--WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I'M NOT DOING THIS.
(Meredith) NO, ALLISON--

20:50.280 --> 20:52.822
I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS.
I DON'T WANT TO STAY HERE.
ALLISON, HONEY,
STAY IN THE BED.

20:52.822 --> 20:55.325
ALLISON, STAY IN THE BED.
I DON'T--I DON'T--I DON'T
WANT THEM TO TOUCH MY SON!

20:55.325 --> 20:58.428
I UNDERSTAND, BUT--
I DON'T WANT THIS! NO,

21:39.429 --> 21:41.300
(Teddy sighs)

21:41.300 --> 21:43.032
I NEED AN ANSWER.

21:43.032 --> 21:45.535
IS IT OVER?

21:50.610 --> 21:52.782
YEAH.

21:52.782 --> 21:55.715
IT'S OVER.

21:57.487 --> 21:59.318
OKAY.

21:59.318 --> 22:01.421
OKAY.

22:01.421 --> 22:03.893
YOU NEED TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

22:05.455 --> 22:07.357
RIGHT NOW.

22:07.357 --> 22:08.698
THIS MINUTE?

22:08.698 --> 22:11.701
WE NEED TO PREP YOU
AND THEN CUT YOUR CHEST OPEN.

22:11.701 --> 22:13.703
SO, YES...

22:13.703 --> 22:16.536
THIS MINUTE.

22:28.718 --> 22:31.751
(Julia crying)

22:43.793 --> 22:45.795
HEY, HEY, MEREDITH.

22:45.795 --> 22:47.797
UM, WHAT WAS
THE DEAL WITH ADELE WEBER

22:47.797 --> 22:49.799
WHEN YOU SAW HER
A FEW WEEKS BACK?

22:49.799 --> 22:52.802
OH, SHE FRACTURED HER WRIST.
YEAH, BUT YOU ORDERED
A HEAD C.T.

22:52.802 --> 22:54.804
JUST TO BE SURE,
AND IT WAS CLEAR.

22:54.804 --> 22:56.806
OKAY, I READ THE FILE.
WHAT I'M ASKING FOR

22:56.806 --> 22:58.808
IS A MORE COMPLETE IMPRESSION
OF THE PATIENT.

22:58.808 --> 23:00.510
I MYSELF JUST ACCUSED HER

23:00.510 --> 23:01.511
OF BEING EITHER A WINO
OR A JUNKIE,

23:01.511 --> 23:03.513
AND THAT SEEMS
NOT TO BE THE CASE

23:03.513 --> 23:06.416
'CAUSE THE TOX SCREEN WAS CLEAR
AND SO WAS THE BREATHALYZER.

23:06.416 --> 23:08.918
SO I'M WONDERING
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON.
(lowered voice)
SHE FELL DOWN,

23:08.918 --> 23:10.920
AND SHE COULDN'T GET
HER STORY STRAIGHT.

23:10.920 --> 23:13.923
I TRIED TO TALK TO THE CHIEF,
AND HE GOT VERY ANGRY WITH ME

23:13.923 --> 23:15.925
BECAUSE I SUGGESTED
THAT THERE WAS SOME INDICATION

23:15.925 --> 23:17.597
OF EARLY DEMENTIA.

23:17.597 --> 23:19.899
AND HE THINKS,
BECAUSE I'M ON DEREK'S STUDY,

23:19.899 --> 23:22.001
THAT I SEE ALZHEIMER'S
EVERYWHERE.

23:22.001 --> 23:24.003
HMM.
(normal voice)
ARE YOU CONCERNED?

23:24.003 --> 23:25.575
YEAH.

23:25.575 --> 23:28.478
DID YOU REALLY CALL
THE CHIEF'S WIFE A WINO?

23:28.478 --> 23:29.779
(elevator bell dings)

23:29.779 --> 23:32.512
MY FINEST MOMENT.

23:32.512 --> 23:35.585
(indistinct conversations)

23:40.520 --> 23:44.494
I AM SO GRATEFUL YOU'RE NOT
TRYING TO KNOCK ME UP.

23:44.494 --> 23:46.425
YOU'RE WELCOME.

23:46.425 --> 23:48.427
THE THREE MUSKETEERS
ARE ALL FREAKED OUT

23:48.427 --> 23:50.129
ABOUT HAVING AN AMNIO,

23:50.129 --> 23:53.132
AND MEREDITH IS GETTING SHOT UP
EVERY DAY WITH FERTILITY DRUGS.

23:53.132 --> 23:56.035
IT IS A NIGHTMARE, THE WHOLE
THING. AND ALL FOR WHAT?

23:56.035 --> 23:57.607
JUST TO SIGN UP FOR,

23:57.607 --> 23:59.609
UH, TWO YEARS
OF SLEEP DEPRIVATION AND FECES?

23:59.609 --> 24:01.110
(elevator bell dings)

24:01.110 --> 24:04.474
I'M SO HAPPY WE'RE NEVER
GONNA HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT.

24:04.474 --> 24:07.577
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

24:11.180 --> 24:13.523
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

24:13.523 --> 24:15.154
WELL...

24:15.154 --> 24:17.226
I WANT THE AMNIO.

24:17.226 --> 24:19.629
I JUST--I WANT TO HAVE
THE INFORMATION, WHATEVER IT IS.

24:19.629 --> 24:22.562
THAT DOESN'T MEAN
I'M GONNA ACT ON IT. IT JUST--

24:22.562 --> 24:25.495
I--WHATEVER THE SITUATION IS,
I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT IT.

24:25.495 --> 24:28.598
(indistinct conversations)

24:28.598 --> 24:30.469
OKAY.

24:30.469 --> 24:31.941
THANK YOU.

24:31.941 --> 24:35.074
(chuckles) WHAT,
THAT'S IT?

24:35.074 --> 24:37.647
WELL, I JUST WANTED HER
TO THINK ABOUT IT.

24:37.647 --> 24:39.549
I WANTED ALL OF US
TO REALLY THINK ABOUT IT.

24:39.549 --> 24:41.050
AND YOU DID.

24:41.050 --> 24:43.883
THERE'S THREE OF US.
I GOT OUTVOTED.

24:43.883 --> 24:45.885
AS LONG AS MY 33%
IS CONSIDERED

24:45.885 --> 24:48.818
AND NOBODY'S BODY PARTS GET
MORE A VOTE THAN I DO,

24:48.818 --> 24:50.820
THAT'S ALL I CAN ASK FOR.

24:53.492 --> 24:56.065
ALL RIGHT, ALLISON,
THE ANESTHETIC IS IN.

24:56.065 --> 24:58.067
I JUST NEED TO MAKE
A SLIGHT INCISION,

24:58.067 --> 25:00.570
AND WE SHOULD BE GOOD TO GO,
OKAY?

25:00.570 --> 25:02.532
YEP.

25:02.532 --> 25:05.835
(paper crinkling)

25:05.835 --> 25:07.837
(monitor beeping rhythmically)
OKAY.

25:07.837 --> 25:09.739
(exhales deeply)

25:13.583 --> 25:15.815
ALL RIGHT. GOOD.

25:15.815 --> 25:18.988
YOU WANT TO CELEBRATE
BY DRILLING SOME BURR HOLES?
I WOULD LOVE TO.

25:18.988 --> 25:20.990
OKAY, ON THE BLACK MARK.

25:20.990 --> 25:23.853
EASY IN, EASY OUT.

25:26.696 --> 25:28.197
READY?

25:28.197 --> 25:31.601
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

25:31.601 --> 25:33.703
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
JUST GO AHEAD AND START.

25:33.703 --> 25:35.534
I CAN'T.

25:35.534 --> 25:37.106
(whispers) CAN'T WHAT?

25:37.106 --> 25:40.109
(whispers)
I CAN'T SEE IT.

25:52.081 --> 25:53.723
(Teddy) THEY'RE LYING.

25:53.723 --> 25:56.555
SHE'S JUST GONNA LAY LOW
FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS,

25:56.555 --> 25:58.557
AND THEN THEY'RE GONNA
GET BACK TOGETHER

25:58.557 --> 26:00.559
AND DESTROY THIS
PERFECTLY GOOD PAIR OF LUNGS.

26:00.559 --> 26:02.992
SHE'S PROBABLY
STILL IN THE HOSPITAL.
YOU WANT TO STOP
THE TRANSPLANT?

26:02.992 --> 26:05.595
IT'S TOO LATE.
LUNGS ARE ON THEIR WAY.

26:05.595 --> 26:07.867
THE CLOCK'S ALREADY TICKING.
MAYBE IT'LL BE OKAY.

26:07.867 --> 26:09.869
YOU KNOW,
M-MAYBE IT'S NOT A WASTE.

26:09.869 --> 26:11.971
THEY LOVE EACH OTHER.
IT--IT IS RARE.

26:11.971 --> 26:14.804
WHAT IF THEY ARE SOUL MATES?

26:16.606 --> 26:18.608
AND YOU'RE THINKING
ABOUT SLOAN AGAIN.

26:18.608 --> 26:21.050
NO. WHY?

26:21.050 --> 26:23.052
HE TOLD CALLIE
THAT HE WOULD BE HAPPY

26:23.052 --> 26:25.354
TO RAISE A SPECIAL NEEDS CHILD.
OKAY?

26:25.354 --> 26:26.856
HE'S A GOOD MAN.

26:26.856 --> 26:29.358
I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT IT
WHEN I WALKED AWAY.

26:29.358 --> 26:33.062
I JUST GOT MAD AND I WALKED.
YOU DID THINK ABOUT IT.
YOU THINK ABOUT EVERYTHING.

26:33.062 --> 26:35.064
OKAY, WHAT IF I WAS WRONG?

26:35.064 --> 26:38.768
YOU REALLY WANT TO BE DATING
A GUY, TWO WOMEN, AND A BABY?

26:38.768 --> 26:41.731
OKAY,
WELL, THAT SOUNDS BAD.
YOU THINK?

26:41.731 --> 26:43.703
(indistinct conversations)

26:43.703 --> 26:45.274
(man) DOCTOR.
YEAH.

26:45.274 --> 26:46.906
(indistinct conversations
continue)

26:46.906 --> 26:48.908
UH, I SAID
I'M NEVER HAVING KIDS,

26:48.908 --> 26:50.910
AND YOU SAID
"YEAH, YEAH, YEAH."

26:50.910 --> 26:52.912
UH, WHAT EXACTLY DOES
"YEAH, YEAH, YEAH" MEAN?

26:52.912 --> 26:55.915
WELL, OF COURSE YOU DON'T WANT
TO HAVE KIDS. YOU'RE A RESIDENT.

26:55.915 --> 26:57.917
I FELT THE SAME
WHEN I WAS STARTING OUT,

26:57.917 --> 26:59.919
SO I FIGURED WE COULD, UH,

26:59.919 --> 27:02.792
REVISIT THIS CONVERSATION
DOWN THE LINE.

27:02.792 --> 27:04.724
WE ALREADY DISCUSSED THIS.

27:04.724 --> 27:06.395
YES, BUT PEOPLE CHANGE.

27:06.395 --> 27:08.397
AND IT'S POSSIBLE,
IN A COUPLE OF YEARS,

27:08.397 --> 27:10.830
YOU'LL COME AROUND.

27:13.733 --> 27:16.706
WHEN HAVE YOU EVER KNOWN ME
TO COME AROUND?

27:16.706 --> 27:17.667
(scoffs)

27:17.667 --> 27:19.168
THE IDEA THAT YOUR CAREER

27:19.168 --> 27:21.640
IS THE ONLY THING
THAT WILL EVER MATTER TO YOU

27:21.640 --> 27:23.642
IS FRANKLY
A YOUNG PERSON'S NOTION.

27:23.642 --> 27:26.645
AND AFTER WHAT YOU'VE BEEN
THROUGH THESE LAST FEW MONTHS,

27:26.645 --> 27:28.647
I WOULD'VE THOUGHT YOU'D HAVE
A MORE...

27:28.647 --> 27:30.820
NUANCED VISION
OF THIS WHOLE THING ALREADY.

27:30.820 --> 27:34.653
OKAY, SO--SO--SO YOU ASSUMED
THAT I WAS GONNA GROW UP

27:34.653 --> 27:37.656
AND THAT I'M GOING TO GET OVER
MY CHILDISH VISION OF MY LIFE?

27:37.656 --> 27:39.759
WELL, THAT'S ONE WAY
TO PUT IT.

27:39.759 --> 27:43.032
I ALSO THOUGHT THAT YOU
MIGHT FIND A LITTLE ROOM

27:43.032 --> 27:45.034
FORMYVISION OF LIFE.

27:48.968 --> 27:51.971
WELL, I'VE GROWN UP
AS MUCH AS I PLAN TO.

27:51.971 --> 27:54.974
AND... I DON'T COME AROUND.

27:58.677 --> 28:00.179
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

28:00.179 --> 28:02.411
DR. AVERY.

28:02.411 --> 28:04.714
READY?
YEP. HERE YOU GO.

28:04.714 --> 28:06.816
OKAY.
GOT IT.

28:06.816 --> 28:09.819
GOT IT? GREAT.
PICKUPS AND POTTS SCISSORS.

28:09.819 --> 28:11.460
(beeping continues)

28:11.460 --> 28:13.923
DR. GREY, BRING 'EM OVER.

28:15.925 --> 28:18.728
(suction gurgling)

28:18.728 --> 28:20.800
GOD, THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL.

28:20.800 --> 28:23.702
