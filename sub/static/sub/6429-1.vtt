{\pos(270,240)}Now, in addition to all the museums
and art galleries

00:10.176 --> 00:13.040
and other great stuff
here in our nation's capital,

00:13.165 --> 00:16.570
there's one thing you're gonna love
probably more than anything else...

00:16.695 --> 00:17.808
the dinosaurs.

00:18.855 --> 00:20.455
This way. Stick together.

00:34.201 --> 00:35.201
Agent Bering?

00:35.745 --> 00:37.453
- Hi, Chet Greenfield.
- Hello.

00:37.675 --> 00:39.210
- Sorry I'm late.
- No problem.

00:39.335 --> 00:42.041
My assistant said you double-checked
everything yesterday.

00:42.209 --> 00:44.640
I did, but I'd like to run a full review
before we lock it down.

00:44.765 --> 00:45.765
Sure.

00:46.235 --> 00:47.880
- With you.
- Me?

00:48.005 --> 00:50.540
You're the boss. I'd like to avoid
any chain-of-command confusion.

00:50.665 --> 00:52.051
I tell you, and it gets done.

00:52.176 --> 00:54.530
- Shall we start in the main hall?
- Well, I understand,

00:54.655 --> 00:58.396
- but I'm pretty booked up{\ at the moment}right now.
- I apologize for the inconvenience.

00:58.805 --> 01:01.690
- I'll clear my schedule.
- I'd appreciate that, sir.

01:17.105 --> 01:18.605
Good morning, Kacey.

01:20.372 --> 01:22.615
I just figured out who you are.

01:23.915 --> 01:25.265
You're a fireman.

01:29.375 --> 01:30.375
No.

01:31.005 --> 01:32.115
Come on.

01:33.315 --> 01:34.315
You know

01:35.135 --> 01:36.395
absolutely

01:36.935 --> 01:38.180
everything about me.

01:39.385 --> 01:42.143
Well, that's because you talk a lot.

02:15.715 --> 02:18.471
Gordon, this is agent Bering
with the Secret Service.

02:18.685 --> 02:19.901
Gordon Letanik?

02:20.445 --> 02:22.145
And what's...
What's this?

02:22.476 --> 02:24.030
An Aztec blood stone.

02:24.195 --> 02:25.978
The boss of virgin sacrifices.

02:26.146 --> 02:28.745
Handsome devil. I'm just cleaning him
for the reception tonight.

02:28.982 --> 02:31.720
Agent Bering wants the group D artifacts
moved to the west wall.

02:31.845 --> 02:33.410
They're blocking an exit.

02:33.535 --> 02:36.235
Lose Tuvalu and Malta.
Move Britain to the back.

02:36.657 --> 02:39.740
If it still doesn't fit, see me
and we'll cut something else.

02:39.865 --> 02:41.715
Yes, sir. I'll just finish up.

02:45.025 --> 02:46.080
What's next?

02:46.205 --> 02:49.509
The main floor bathrooms.
I'll need the plumbing pulled again.

03:07.965 --> 03:09.720
I would try to sneak you in,

03:09.845 --> 03:12.005
but the Secret Service
will be there,

03:12.605 --> 03:14.030
and they can be jerks.

03:14.155 --> 03:15.720
So I've heard.

03:16.321 --> 03:17.400
Call you soon.

03:17.525 --> 03:18.625
You promise?

03:18.825 --> 03:19.825
Promise.

03:20.275 --> 03:21.275
Bye now.

03:49.325 --> 03:50.325
Champagne?

03:52.060 --> 03:53.060
Thank you.

03:53.185 --> 03:54.185
Champagne?

03:55.445 --> 03:56.445
Cham...

04:07.415 --> 04:09.015
Status check on Eagle.

04:32.315 --> 04:34.965
- Who's on Emerald entrance?
- <i>Me. Morris.</i>

04:45.305 --> 04:46.845
Why aren't you at Emerald?

04:47.965 --> 04:48.965
Well,

04:49.235 --> 04:50.497
because I'm here.

04:51.415 --> 04:54.155
- How's Home Base?
- We're calling Home Base "Magenta".

04:54.375 --> 04:56.025
Well, I'm not.

04:56.325 --> 04:58.160
- You changed the protocol.
- I tweaked it.

04:58.285 --> 05:00.620
I wrote it.
And I didn't use colors.

05:00.745 --> 05:02.405
Why weren't you at my briefing?

05:02.625 --> 05:04.530
I was vetting one of the servers.

05:04.655 --> 05:07.060
- Screwing off is more like it.
- Well, you say po-tah-to.

05:07.185 --> 05:09.266
- Get back to Emerald.
- You're not my superior.

05:09.434 --> 05:11.227
Dickinson gave this to me.
I'm running it.

05:12.155 --> 05:13.180
- Meeka.
- Myka.

05:15.615 --> 05:16.615
I get...

05:17.495 --> 05:18.495
vibes.

05:23.823 --> 05:24.823
Sorry?

05:24.991 --> 05:27.620
This isn't some run and gun
that you're used to in Denver.

05:27.745 --> 05:29.705
- Get to the point, Lattimer.
- Dickinson gave you

05:29.830 --> 05:31.372
this shindig with my protocol

05:31.540 --> 05:33.666
because my specialty is logistics,
framing...

05:33.945 --> 05:35.150
and I kid you not,

05:35.275 --> 05:37.211
there is something
really off in here.

05:37.425 --> 05:38.520
<i>Eagle at Magenta.</i>

05:38.645 --> 05:40.380
<i>Mr. President,
wait a moment, please.</i>

05:40.505 --> 05:42.591
This is Bering.
Eagle is free to enter.

05:43.185 --> 05:46.470
Negative, negative. This is Lattimer.
Hold Eagle at five until further.

05:46.638 --> 05:48.050
- Copy?
- <i>Copy{\ that}. Holding Eagle.</i>

05:48.175 --> 05:49.265
Get back to Emerald.

05:49.555 --> 05:51.058
Look, Myka,

05:51.485 --> 05:55.280
why don't you pull your head out
of your Magenta and feel the room.

05:55.705 --> 05:57.880
- Something's off.
- Listen, Showboat. Nothing's off.

05:58.005 --> 05:59.800
The room is fine.
Everything is fine.

05:59.925 --> 06:01.365
Now take your vibe...

06:01.768 --> 06:02.611
and go.

06:06.665 --> 06:08.135
- Enjoy your party.
- I will.

06:13.425 --> 06:15.425
I want a perimeter check asap.

06:35.598 --> 06:37.550
- Emerald clear.
- <i>Peach clear.</i>

06:37.675 --> 06:39.675
- <i>Orange clear.</i>
- <i>Gold clear.</i>

06:40.145 --> 06:41.345
<i>Crimson clear.</i>

07:32.385 --> 07:33.385
There's...

07:35.165 --> 07:36.550
There's blood, so...

07:42.655 --> 07:43.655
Pete?

07:44.465 --> 07:46.590
- What are you doing here?
- Working.

07:47.295 --> 07:48.475
Is there a fire?

07:49.515 --> 07:52.790
- Excuse me, sir. Wait just a second.
- Secret Service. This is...

07:52.915 --> 07:54.815
Gotta go. Excuse me!
Excuse me!

07:56.305 --> 07:58.400
That's an okay for Eagle to enter.

07:58.525 --> 07:59.609
<i>Affirmative.</i>

08:30.915 --> 08:32.010
Clear Eagle.

08:36.850 --> 08:37.975
Freeze!

08:54.295 --> 08:55.367
Drop the knife.

09:02.939 --> 09:03.925
Hold your fire!

09:05.337 --> 09:07.796
Seriously, Gordon, drop the knife.

09:11.789 --> 09:12.617
Drop that.

09:16.135 --> 09:18.348
- Whatever it is.
- Can't do that, Pete.

09:26.174 --> 09:27.024
Weapon.

09:29.277 --> 09:30.265
We're done here.

10:19.601 --> 10:21.349
Tell me you found the guy.

10:21.474 --> 10:23.562
The guy who you said stole the rock?

10:23.923 --> 10:25.499
We're gonna need a sample.

10:29.488 --> 10:31.038
Come on, Dickinson.

10:31.549 --> 10:33.799
Well, you said,
among many strange things,

10:33.967 --> 10:36.723
- that the rock was bleeding.
- It was.

10:36.848 --> 10:39.740
Taxpayers will probably wanna know
if you were high, paranoid,

10:39.865 --> 10:42.052
or just part
of an Aztec art theft ring.

10:42.177 --> 10:44.101
In the meantime,
you're suspended, with pay,

10:44.428 --> 10:46.562
for two weeks, till we
get this thing worked out.

10:46.981 --> 10:49.898
- What about Morris?
- He says nothing happened at emerald.

10:50.117 --> 10:52.276
Okay, can we... stop
with the colors already?

10:55.151 --> 10:57.739
What about...
the guy with the knife?

10:58.287 --> 10:59.575
- What, Letanik?
- Yes.

10:59.700 --> 11:00.634
He's in a coma.

11:01.369 --> 11:03.537
Docs don't know
why or how long that's gonna last.

11:03.744 --> 11:05.873
- And Bering?
- Myka's being thanked personally

11:05.998 --> 11:08.298
by the President and the first lady.

11:11.749 --> 11:14.246
- Of course she is.
- She's going places.

11:14.371 --> 11:16.967
You, on the other hand,
you're going to the bathroom.

11:19.658 --> 11:20.808
That's funny.

11:50.691 --> 11:51.841
Mr. Lattimer.

11:52.883 --> 11:54.087
My name's Frederic.

11:54.380 --> 11:55.464
Frederic what?

12:00.028 --> 12:02.638
- Mrs. Frederic.
- Well, that's a relief.

12:02.821 --> 12:04.384
I'm with the government.

12:04.509 --> 12:06.266
I'm here on a matter
of national security.

12:11.219 --> 12:13.951
- What's that?
- An invitation to endless wonder.

12:14.901 --> 12:16.943
Could you sound
a little more creepy?

12:17.112 --> 12:18.112
Read it.

12:21.934 --> 12:25.118
Please note the action code.
It is legitimate.

12:25.287 --> 12:27.537
- You're part of my bailiwick now.
- Your bailiwick?

12:27.662 --> 12:29.200
- You're working for me.
- For you?

12:29.325 --> 12:31.617
- Am I stuttering?
- No, ma'am.

12:40.802 --> 12:42.205
All right, I get it.

12:42.330 --> 12:44.394
It's a... this is a joke, right?

12:45.343 --> 12:48.600
Dickinson put you guys up...
This is Dickinson being funny, right?

12:49.213 --> 12:51.311
Do I look like a joke?

12:55.775 --> 12:58.584
You're to be in South Dakota
at those coordinates at noon tomorrow.

12:58.709 --> 13:01.647
You will mention our meeting
and your pending assignment to no one.

13:01.772 --> 13:03.115
Is that understood?

13:03.283 --> 13:05.961
How long am I gonna be
in South Dakota?

13:06.086 --> 13:08.607
- Indefinitely.
- Indef... no, no.

13:10.528 --> 13:11.873
I've got a life here.

13:12.193 --> 13:12.916
Really?

13:14.600 --> 13:15.650
I've got...

13:18.325 --> 13:19.325
things.

13:19.716 --> 13:21.258
Pack light, Mr. Lattimer.

13:22.340 --> 13:25.137
We'll ship what you need
and store the rest.

13:38.932 --> 13:40.986
<i>Prepare to turn right</i>

13:41.155 --> 13:42.612
<i>in 100 feet.</i>

13:43.638 --> 13:45.344
<i>Turn right now.</i>

13:49.245 --> 13:51.079
<i>You have missed your turn.</i>

13:51.247 --> 13:52.247
<i>Go back.</i>

13:57.993 --> 13:59.239
<i>Turn right.</i>

14:17.906 --> 14:19.830
<i>Destination straight ahead.</i>

14:20.182 --> 14:21.882
You gotta be kidding me.

15:12.790 --> 15:14.040
Endless wonder.

15:30.322 --> 15:32.470
It's agent Lattimer!
I'm here!

16:14.856 --> 16:15.890
Great.

16:29.759 --> 16:32.282
- I heard you were suspended.
- Yeah, I heard that too.

16:35.070 --> 16:36.119
Why are you here?

16:37.584 --> 16:40.468
I was ordered here, last night.

16:41.439 --> 16:42.639
Mrs. Frederic.

16:43.886 --> 16:45.386
Said it was a matter of...

16:45.511 --> 16:46.988
National security.

16:47.305 --> 16:48.305
Right.

17:17.777 --> 17:19.128
How are you guys doing?

17:21.006 --> 17:22.271
I'm sorry I'm late.

17:24.231 --> 17:26.252
I had to fix the fish.

17:27.906 --> 17:29.631
- Stop right there.
- What are you doing?

17:29.799 --> 17:31.892
This is the guy.
{\You know, }The one from last night.

17:32.017 --> 17:34.427
- The guy who stole the rock.
- You stole the rock.

17:34.595 --> 17:36.888
It's a blood stone. It's safe.
It's inside the building.

17:37.057 --> 17:38.765
It's the property of the museum.

17:38.933 --> 17:41.726
And that museum is property
of the{\ US} Government, so is the warehouse.

17:41.961 --> 17:43.686
And so am I.

17:43.964 --> 17:46.212
I'm secret service.
I also work for Mrs. Frederic.

17:46.337 --> 17:48.900
I'm Dr. Nielson.
You can call me Artie.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.268
Got some ID?

17:52.152 --> 17:54.698
We take the secret part
seriously around here.

17:55.658 --> 17:57.467
I just wanted to thank you
for your assist

17:57.592 --> 18:00.328
in last night's retrieval.
That was very good.

18:00.496 --> 18:02.080
Did you throw that foot ball at me?

18:02.705 --> 18:04.290
You weren't here when I threw it.

18:05.003 --> 18:06.901
It takes a while to circle back.

18:07.407 --> 18:08.420
Come on inside.

18:08.545 --> 18:10.171
- I'll show you around.
- Around what?

18:12.282 --> 18:13.383
What am I doing here?

18:13.552 --> 18:15.427
I'll explain everything inside.
Come on.

18:17.703 --> 18:18.638
I made cookies.

18:21.223 --> 18:22.684
Come on.

18:23.346 --> 18:25.205
Really, it's okay. Go inside.

18:25.563 --> 18:26.597
Don't go far!

18:26.722 --> 18:28.072
Okay. Come on in.

18:28.952 --> 18:30.911
Wait for me
at the bottom of the stairs.

18:31.036 --> 18:32.036
It's fine.

18:33.716 --> 18:35.266
Don't touch anything.

18:45.166 --> 18:46.754
Don't touch the bombs.

19:00.337 --> 19:02.348
Hold this.
Hold it.

19:17.008 --> 19:18.008
Come on.

19:21.203 --> 19:22.203
It's okay.

19:46.783 --> 19:48.033
Right this way.

19:54.281 --> 19:56.269
Ms. Bering, Mr. Lattimer,

19:56.801 --> 19:59.197
welcome to Warehouse 13.

20:33.445 --> 20:36.850
- I'm thrilled you're on the team.
- What team? What is this place?

20:36.975 --> 20:40.475
Officially, K-39 triple-Z
on the North American grid.

20:41.275 --> 20:42.275
But...

20:42.505 --> 20:44.701
I like to think of it
as America's attic.

20:51.183 --> 20:52.876
Projet-SG (1.00)

20:58.705 --> 21:00.255
{\pub}Pete, close the door.

21:03.075 --> 21:05.350
Tell me exactly what I'm doing here.

21:05.765 --> 21:07.911
{\pos(192,235)}Exactly? That's a little dif...

21:08.675 --> 21:10.216
{\pos(192,235)}Well, to put it plainly,

21:10.341 --> 21:13.730
{\pos(192,235)}you're both joining me as fellow
gatherers and protectors of secrets.

21:13.898 --> 21:15.148
Put it plainer.

21:15.524 --> 21:16.973
{\pos(192,235)}This... This warehouse...

21:17.365 --> 21:19.956
{\pos(192,235)}{\Well, }Look, the Warehouse needs you.
It needs... Pete, don't touch.

21:20.081 --> 21:22.585
{\pos(192,235)}It needs your combined talents.
{\I mean, }He's intuitive, and you're...

21:22.710 --> 21:25.992
{\pos(192,235)}{\I mean, }You've got a scrupulous eye for detail.
He's scattershot, {\ you see, }and you're meticulous.

21:26.335 --> 21:27.785
You look, he leaps.

21:28.305 --> 21:31.444
There's been a mistake.
I'm too valuable to be wasted here.

21:33.725 --> 21:34.584
No offense.

21:35.875 --> 21:37.956
- Of course not.
- Can I use your phone, please?

21:38.081 --> 21:39.081
{\pos(192,235)}Mine?

21:39.675 --> 21:41.022
{\pos(192,235)}It's broken.

21:42.365 --> 21:45.386
{\pos(192,235)}- {\Well, }I have to make a phone call, so...
- There's no signal here.

21:52.645 --> 21:55.688
{\pos(192,235)}Yeah, you're... You're... Just pull...
Pull the door, and you'll be... now.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.245
There you go.

22:00.235 --> 22:01.736
I think she had other plans.

22:02.822 --> 22:03.613
So did I.

22:14.045 --> 22:16.125
You want juice
or are you a milk person?

22:19.685 --> 22:23.160
- You know what I'd really like?
- I do indeed, but falling off the wagon

22:23.285 --> 22:25.346
may not be the best option
at this point.

22:27.138 --> 22:28.488
- Milk it is.
- Yeah.

22:29.975 --> 22:32.670
- That's Mrs. Frederic.
- Long time ago.

22:33.035 --> 22:35.734
- She looks exactly the same.
- Odd, isn't it?

22:37.245 --> 22:38.679
You don't want a cookie?

22:41.525 --> 22:43.611
- So who are these guys?
- Former colleagues.

22:46.325 --> 22:47.975
{\pos(192,225)}And where are they now?

22:49.525 --> 22:51.723
This one and this one are dead.

22:52.315 --> 22:55.456
This one, a mental institution
in Germany. And this last one...

22:55.624 --> 22:57.530
{\pos(192,205)}disappeared.
One day I'll find him.

23:01.435 --> 23:04.464
Ted, these are two of my best agents.
How can you not know?

23:05.050 --> 23:07.427
I'm looking at the order.
You processed it. How {\*can you not}can't you know?

23:07.765 --> 23:08.765
Hold on.

23:09.035 --> 23:10.858
- Dickinson.
- <i>Sir, it's Myka Bering.</i>

23:11.473 --> 23:14.600
Sir, I have a little situation here.
I'm not sure...

23:14.835 --> 23:17.478
Yeah, yeah. You know what?
I'm looking at the transfer order{\ right now}.

23:17.826 --> 23:20.230
{\pos(192,220)}<i>The name on here is Frederic.
You're transferred to where?</i>

23:20.355 --> 23:22.400
{\pos(192,220)}- <i>Where are you?</i>
- {\Well, }I'm in South Dakota.

23:22.525 --> 23:24.837
{\pos(192,220)}- <i>Where?</i>
- South Dakota.

23:24.962 --> 23:27.625
{\pos(192,220)}- <i>What are you doing in South Dakota?</i>
- You don't know about this?

23:27.750 --> 23:29.898
<i>No. Who is Frederic?</i>

23:32.325 --> 23:33.325
Sir?

23:34.255 --> 23:35.255
Sir?

23:37.255 --> 23:39.350
{\pos(192,205)}- <i>Who's this Frederic?</i>
- Sir! Yes, yes.

23:39.475 --> 23:42.413
{\pos(192,205)}She handed me orders last night

23:42.538 --> 23:45.382
to come here to a warehouse
in South Dakota.

23:45.507 --> 23:48.343
The order code was solid,
and Lattimer's here too.

23:49.025 --> 23:52.510
Look, I'm requesting an immediate
stand down and transfer back to DC.

23:52.635 --> 23:55.810
{\pos(192,185)}<i>Myka. Myka, I can't do that, okay?
This order trumps me.</i>

23:55.935 --> 23:58.019
Let me get on this,
{\and }I'll get you back here asap.

23:58.385 --> 24:00.260
- What should I do?
- <i>Follow orders.</i>

24:00.385 --> 24:03.397
- {\pos(192,205)}<i>Those orders, both of you.</i>
- And how long will this take?

24:03.609 --> 24:05.818
Sir? Sir?
Are you still there?

24:06.845 --> 24:08.445
{\pos(192,225)}That's a pile of crap.

24:09.405 --> 24:11.755
{\pos(192,225)}- No kidding.
- No, I'm not kidding.

24:11.925 --> 24:14.285
You're actually standing
in a big pile of cow manure.

24:20.960 --> 24:24.225
- Oatmeal scotchie?
- No. Thank you.

24:24.575 --> 24:25.671
I don't eat sugar.

24:26.375 --> 24:27.525
Good for you.

24:30.095 --> 24:31.095
Listen...

24:32.985 --> 24:36.620
Please don't think of this assignment,
you know, as some sort of punishment.

24:36.745 --> 24:38.360
- Can you hold this?
- What?

24:38.485 --> 24:41.435
You know, yeah,
your presence here is not really

24:41.755 --> 24:44.205
a reaction to what happened
to you in Denver.

24:44.655 --> 24:45.655
So...

24:46.445 --> 24:48.560
I got a commendation
for what happened in Denver.

24:48.685 --> 24:51.887
Yes, you did.
It's time for the nickel tour. Come on.

24:54.580 --> 24:55.859
The order trumps Dickinson?

24:56.315 --> 24:58.412
The first Warehouse 13
was built in '98.

24:58.580 --> 25:01.874
- So we're stuck.
- Until he works out a transfer, yes.

25:02.042 --> 25:02.959
1898.

25:03.355 --> 25:06.629
We didn't have a handle
on how to store stuff. It burned down.

25:07.825 --> 25:11.610
Some remodeling and excavations
were necessary as the years went on

25:11.735 --> 25:14.930
to accommodate the arrival of more
and more and more and more artifacts.

25:15.055 --> 25:16.790
What's stored here, exactly?

25:16.915 --> 25:18.558
This and that. Bric-a-brac.

25:18.975 --> 25:20.726
Some things along the lines of...

25:21.653 --> 25:24.190
last night's rock and roll.
I'm talking about the blood stone.

25:24.315 --> 25:25.469
Both hands...

25:26.225 --> 25:27.660
on the bar, please.

25:27.785 --> 25:29.735
I think I'll survive a crash.

25:31.345 --> 25:33.811
No, that's not a safety bar.
It's a conduit.

25:33.936 --> 25:35.533
You and Pete are the power source.

25:35.895 --> 25:39.145
Your combined electrical energy
makes this thing move.

25:39.860 --> 25:41.038
It's fine, it's fine.

25:41.400 --> 25:43.739
Look, Thomas Edison built
this automobile for Henry Ford

25:43.864 --> 25:46.419
as a proof of concept,
and it's perfectly safe.

25:46.835 --> 25:47.835
Trust me.

25:48.756 --> 25:51.299
Put your hands on the bar.
Put your hands on the bar.

25:51.795 --> 25:52.795
Thank you.

25:53.345 --> 25:55.245
We need both of you.

25:57.723 --> 25:59.973
Hands on the bar, Myka.
Thank you.

26:03.355 --> 26:04.355
Edison,

26:04.535 --> 26:08.237
he wanted Ford to let go of oil,
but Ford, no, no, he stuck with it

26:08.362 --> 26:11.235
because it ruined his engines faster.
People had to keep buying them.

26:11.403 --> 26:13.403
- What is that?
- What?

26:14.265 --> 26:16.908
That is training flight 22.

26:17.368 --> 26:19.076
We pulled that
from the Bermuda Triangle.

26:19.997 --> 26:22.098
The Triangle's been trying
to pull it back ever since.

26:25.495 --> 26:26.667
Duck and cover.

26:33.555 --> 26:34.730
It's harmless.

26:34.855 --> 26:38.255
The inventory kicks up a little static
from time to time.

26:42.535 --> 26:44.085
Why are you grinning?

26:45.115 --> 26:47.486
Well, don't you think
this stuff is kind of cool?

26:47.611 --> 26:48.735
I mean...

26:53.425 --> 26:55.475
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

26:56.922 --> 26:58.122
He'll be back.

27:02.315 --> 27:04.665
- Hello?
- We should stick together.

27:05.535 --> 27:07.185
Right this way, please.

27:07.905 --> 27:11.212
Many of the items in here,
kind of like the blood stone, Pete,

27:11.380 --> 27:15.380
that you wrestled with last night,
the channel of tangential energy...

27:15.505 --> 27:18.830
Well, tangential energy is
kind of like the energy that forced

27:18.955 --> 27:21.524
the museum employee,
last night, into...

27:21.665 --> 27:23.660
well, into almost committing murder.

27:23.785 --> 27:26.978
- So how does that happen?
- {\Yeah, you know, }We're not really exactly sure how.

27:27.146 --> 27:29.397
It goes back to Einstein,
and E equals...

27:29.805 --> 27:31.305
Yeah, okay. Somehow...

27:32.275 --> 27:36.279
the matter that is in here has just
enough energy to move other matter.

27:36.895 --> 27:38.345
You know, like you.

27:39.715 --> 27:41.325
- Move me where?
- Into trouble.

27:43.069 --> 27:43.786
Bunk.

27:45.315 --> 27:47.545
Is gravity bunk?
Magnetism?

27:47.670 --> 27:50.793
{\You know, }These are mysterious forces that
we live with{\ every day}, but we can't explain 'em.

27:50.961 --> 27:53.511
{\I mean, }Can you even explain to me
how a radio works?

27:54.096 --> 27:56.299
And you don't {\really }care,
as long as you get the traffic report{\, right?}.

27:56.575 --> 27:59.594
But if a radio landed
in the hands of Thomas Jefferson,

27:59.762 --> 28:02.596
you know what Jefferson would do?
He would just lock it up

28:03.212 --> 28:05.975
until he figured out it wasn't gonna
kill him. And that is exactly...

28:06.555 --> 28:09.645
what we do here.
We take the unexplained...

28:11.425 --> 28:12.825
and we just safely

28:13.675 --> 28:14.775
tuck it away

28:14.975 --> 28:18.738
in this super-sized Pandora's box.

28:18.906 --> 28:22.910
- Metaphorically speaking.
- {\Well, actually, }Pandora's box is over in aisle 989B.

28:24.125 --> 28:25.703
Empty, of course.

28:33.610 --> 28:35.321
Do the world a favor
and clear your mind.

28:35.665 --> 28:36.922
Well, that should be easy.

28:42.045 --> 28:44.750
How did that get there?
'Cause I didn't pick that thing up.

28:44.875 --> 28:47.933
It still amazes me
how that thing moves.

28:48.981 --> 28:50.045
{\What? }What? What is it?

28:50.170 --> 28:52.860
Don't talk, don't hope,
don't wish for anything.

28:52.985 --> 28:56.275
- That kettle grants wishes?
- Yes. Now Pete, look at me.

28:58.153 --> 28:59.953
Just keep your eyes on me.

29:01.406 --> 29:02.406
Open it.

29:05.244 --> 29:07.244
Pete! Pete, this...

29:07.412 --> 29:09.026
This is a neutralizer.

29:10.445 --> 29:14.030
You can think of this as a fire
extinguisher for objects that act up.

29:14.155 --> 29:17.380
Now look, I want you to come over here
and {\I want you to}drop that {\very }slowly, right in here.

29:17.548 --> 29:20.016
{\Now listen, }There are items around here,
if you were to put it in there,

29:20.141 --> 29:22.510
they would generate a {\*big }flash,
but this {\little thing }will {\probably just }be a little spark.

29:22.678 --> 29:26.000
But you may flinch, and I don't want {\you }to,
'cause you could drop it, okay?

29:26.125 --> 29:28.225
- Well, I have a wish.
- Don't!

29:42.575 --> 29:44.725
- You wished for a ferret?
- No.

29:45.495 --> 29:48.895
- That was already in the thing.
- I don't think so.

29:50.235 --> 29:52.985
You wished for a transfer,
didn't you?

29:54.615 --> 29:57.753
Impossible wishes,
wishes that can never be granted,

29:57.921 --> 29:59.821
they produce a ferret.

30:01.066 --> 30:02.508
Don't ask me why.

30:02.676 --> 30:05.511
My first year here, the whole place
was crawling with ferrets.

30:10.183 --> 30:12.770
- I swear, I didn't pick that thing up.
- No, I know, I know.

30:12.895 --> 30:16.518
Not everybody is affected
by everything. Here, okay?

30:16.643 --> 30:19.150
You have to be
metaphysically predisposed.

30:19.581 --> 30:22.395
And the external energies,
they have to be in alignment.

30:22.520 --> 30:24.757
- This is just a convergence thing.
- Right, sure, okay.

30:24.882 --> 30:27.010
So we're...
we're all converged here,

30:27.135 --> 30:30.020
but I still have no idea
what I'm supposed to do.

30:30.579 --> 30:31.932
What you're supposed to do

30:32.057 --> 30:34.596
is hunt down whatever is threatening

30:34.721 --> 30:36.958
to ruin the world's day,
{\and }neutralize it and bring it here.

30:37.083 --> 30:39.587
You gotta snag it
and bag it and tag it.

30:39.755 --> 30:41.881
This is crazy!
This is crazy!

30:42.050 --> 30:44.258
{\Well, y}You know, I don't...
It could be, you know, crazy fun.

30:44.427 --> 30:46.634
{\Well, t}That's {\exactly }the attitude
that brought you to our attention.

30:46.804 --> 30:48.512
Do you guys want a cookie
for the road?

30:48.680 --> 30:49.768
What road?

30:49.893 --> 30:52.080
There's rooms for you
at Leena's Bed and Breakfast.

30:52.205 --> 30:55.269
It's about 7 miles down the road
that way, and I'll join you there

30:55.717 --> 30:59.647
in the morning and I'll tou...
{\well, }I'll just join you there in the morning.

31:00.639 --> 31:01.785
Stay close!

31:04.954 --> 31:07.952
Seriously, Lattimer,
there's been a serious screw-up.

31:08.077 --> 31:09.081
I'm serious.

31:09.206 --> 31:10.860
And now you have a ferret.

31:10.985 --> 31:11.985
What?

31:12.747 --> 31:15.898
This town... Is this a town or what?

31:16.023 --> 31:18.437
- What's the name of it?
- Well, it's more like a street.

31:18.562 --> 31:20.426
So it says here to turn left

31:20.551 --> 31:23.616
at Buffalo Station.

31:24.020 --> 31:26.134
What? No, no, no.
It's "Buffalo Statue".

31:26.259 --> 31:28.385
Well, your penmanship is atrocious.

31:28.553 --> 31:31.642
I don't need wise... You know, that's...
You know, don't do that.

31:31.767 --> 31:33.574
Can you finish a sentence?

31:35.811 --> 31:37.406
A full thought?

31:38.958 --> 31:40.800
Would you really like me to?

31:44.986 --> 31:47.957
Wait. No, no, no.
Don't... don't call Dickinson.

31:48.082 --> 31:50.805
- He hates being pestered.
- I don't pester.

31:50.930 --> 31:53.501
{\Well, w}When he knows something, he'll call.

31:54.997 --> 31:57.523
Clearly the phrase
"rolling with the punches"

31:57.648 --> 32:01.488
is not in your vocabulary,
so may I make a suggestion?

32:02.227 --> 32:03.775
What might that be?

32:04.521 --> 32:06.147
Unbunch your panties...

32:07.050 --> 32:09.176
and make the best
of a bad situation.

32:10.517 --> 32:11.679
And how do I do that?

32:12.777 --> 32:13.846
Which part?

32:15.498 --> 32:16.768
You're a freak.

32:17.495 --> 32:18.495
Hello.

32:19.143 --> 32:20.061
I'm Leena.

32:20.399 --> 32:21.855
You must be Pete and Myka.

32:23.415 --> 32:25.565
Come in.
I've got your rooms ready.

32:30.490 --> 32:33.020
We serve three meals,
9:00, noon, and 5:00.

32:33.145 --> 32:35.579
We've got radios in the rooms.
No tvs.

32:35.704 --> 32:37.950
No in-room phones,
but there is one there

32:38.075 --> 32:40.521
at the bottom of the stairs
in the hallway.

32:48.008 --> 32:49.525
You may choose any room.

32:49.650 --> 32:52.455
Is there anywhere I can get a drink?
I mean, a drink... drink?

32:52.580 --> 32:54.212
- What would you like?
- Whiskey neat.

32:54.337 --> 32:56.392
- I can do that.
- Please do that.

33:00.546 --> 33:01.645
She hates traveling.

33:11.407 --> 33:12.703
She loves traveling.

33:12.828 --> 33:15.117
It's the places she's traveled to
that's the problem.

33:16.833 --> 33:19.496
- Can I get you anything?
- No, I'm fine.

33:25.754 --> 33:26.892
Just...

33:35.547 --> 33:38.467
- Is everything okay?
- You're a lucky man, Pete.

33:41.107 --> 33:42.017
I am?

33:42.511 --> 33:43.780
You're in tune.

33:45.573 --> 33:46.514
Very rare.

33:48.157 --> 33:51.115
I don't know what that mea...
Look...

33:52.749 --> 33:54.907
are you... are you connected
to Artie?

33:57.452 --> 33:59.495
Let me know if your bed
is big enough for you.

35:43.836 --> 35:44.725
Hey, buddy.

36:03.056 --> 36:04.704
{\pub}<i>- How'd it go today?</i>
- Not bad.

36:05.987 --> 36:07.831
{\pos(192,230}Lattimer seems interested.

36:07.999 --> 36:10.375
{\pos(192,230}And Ms. Bering, not so much.

36:10.736 --> 36:12.390
{\pos(192,230}<i>Did you select a case for them?</i>

36:12.515 --> 36:16.298
{\Yeah, Listen. }I don't mean any disrespect, but are we
really sure {\that these are }they're {\the people, }the right people?

36:16.888 --> 36:18.050
Because...

36:18.505 --> 36:20.758
<i>I'm fully aware of their baggage.</i>

36:20.883 --> 36:22.721
<i>Now what's the real problem?</i>

36:25.624 --> 36:27.744
<i>Artie, take yourself off the hook.</i>

36:27.869 --> 36:29.394
<i>Their fate falls on me.</i>

36:31.555 --> 36:32.514
You say that...

36:32.639 --> 36:36.151
<i>Dickinson wants them back.
You've got to get them locked in.</i>

36:53.585 --> 36:54.611
Can't sleep?

36:57.738 --> 36:58.782
Yeah. Me neither.

37:08.063 --> 37:09.398
We don't have to talk.

37:14.983 --> 37:15.983
So...

37:16.659 --> 37:20.173
- Do you always eat when {\you're}stressed?
- Do you always talk this much?

37:25.309 --> 37:27.870
You know, no light from the city
to get in the way.

37:28.038 --> 37:29.436
Nothing but sky.

37:30.073 --> 37:32.749
This time of the year, we get Leo,

37:33.232 --> 37:35.794
Cygnus, Sagittarius.

37:35.962 --> 37:37.268
You know this how?

37:38.876 --> 37:41.633
My dad and I used to camp a lot.

37:42.108 --> 37:43.468
Where is he now?

37:48.349 --> 37:49.516
Sorry.

37:51.983 --> 37:53.605
What about your folks?

37:55.186 --> 37:56.460
Colorado Springs.

37:58.341 --> 38:00.986
They own a bookstore
called <i>Bering and Sons</i>.

38:01.571 --> 38:03.822
- How many brothers?
- No brothers. Just me.

38:04.827 --> 38:08.368
My dad thought the "and Sons"
sounded classier.

38:08.493 --> 38:09.712
{\Well, h}He must be proud of you.

38:10.592 --> 38:11.592
Mom is.

38:13.093 --> 38:15.167
Well, did protecting

38:15.292 --> 38:17.818
the president of the United States
turn him around?

38:19.214 --> 38:20.088
This won't.

38:21.409 --> 38:22.507
From Denver to DC

38:22.675 --> 38:25.685
to a warehouse security guard
in six months.

38:25.810 --> 38:27.554
Now there's a career trajectory.

38:28.838 --> 38:31.016
Look, about Denver,

38:31.768 --> 38:34.135
I didn't mean
to spit on that last night.

38:34.769 --> 38:36.980
What you did there
was better than textbook.

38:37.148 --> 38:38.822
We're not discussing that.

38:42.102 --> 38:42.819
Ever.

38:51.184 --> 38:53.155
All right, well, I'm gonna...

38:54.280 --> 38:55.736
go back upstairs...

38:57.558 --> 38:58.877
and not sleep some more.

39:04.207 --> 39:06.085
Earlier, did you hear a...

39:08.638 --> 39:09.642
Hear what?

39:12.173 --> 39:13.433
Never mind.

39:14.745 --> 39:15.925
Dickinson will call.

39:16.232 --> 39:17.232
He better.

39:44.007 --> 39:45.890
Rotation, time,

39:46.812 --> 39:47.759
Seever City.

40:24.964 --> 40:25.964
Come on.

40:47.675 --> 40:49.425
So it's gonna be you, then.

40:51.615 --> 40:52.715
Cody Thomas,

40:53.325 --> 40:56.595
a law school grad student,
at the university of Southern Iowa.

40:57.185 --> 40:58.700
- Iowa?
- Yeah, Iowa.

40:58.825 --> 41:00.567
His parents were killed
in a plane crash.

41:00.692 --> 41:04.010
He is a really good kid{\. He's been }, putting himself
through college with the settlement.

41:04.135 --> 41:05.970
Why are we going to Iowa?

41:06.422 --> 41:08.840
To find whatever it is
that pushed this kid over the edge.

41:09.008 --> 41:11.665
- What edge?
- He struck his girlfriend.

41:14.037 --> 41:14.888
That's it?

41:15.656 --> 41:16.556
So far.

41:18.625 --> 41:21.603
For the past five days, I have been
reviewing 11 possible cases,

41:21.771 --> 41:24.147
looking for whatever doesn't fit,
something out of place,

41:24.315 --> 41:26.858
like blood on a marble floor
that leads to a man with a knife.

41:27.125 --> 41:28.985
Because of a rock
that isn't just a rock.

41:30.435 --> 41:32.280
I've got a hunch
that this is the one.

41:34.509 --> 41:36.576
What exactly are we looking for?

41:36.701 --> 41:37.744
Well, you tell me.

41:38.425 --> 41:40.525
It's bigger than a breadbox...

41:41.725 --> 41:42.775
Or smaller.

41:43.795 --> 41:46.480
If there is an artifact
at the heart of this,

41:46.605 --> 41:49.170
then I've prepared a few questions
for Cody that might reveal it.

41:49.295 --> 41:50.495
Actually, it's

41:51.015 --> 41:52.634
more than a few questions, but...

41:55.245 --> 41:59.071
"Do you have the constant feeling
that today is yesterday?"

42:01.335 --> 42:03.335
If they say yes, then we could...

42:05.785 --> 42:08.357
They probably won't say yes.
It's unlikely.

42:08.605 --> 42:11.153
- {\But }We could be dealing with time slip.
- Or a hangover.

42:12.947 --> 42:14.330
Please take this seriously.

42:14.455 --> 42:17.400
I had a run-in with a Mayan calendar {\a }few
years ago, {\and }that question saved my life.

42:17.525 --> 42:19.953
And the two agents that were with me
were not quite so lucky.

42:21.765 --> 42:22.914
What happened to them?

42:24.115 --> 42:25.365
Their clocks...

42:26.769 --> 42:27.669
Stopped.

42:28.315 --> 42:29.629
So, what? They died?

42:30.955 --> 42:33.008
{\Well, }They'll wish they had
in 100 years or so. Anyway...

42:35.787 --> 42:36.636
Neutralizer.

42:38.863 --> 42:39.890
The purple stuff.

42:40.945 --> 42:42.600
If you find the artifact,

42:42.725 --> 42:45.187
just drown it in there,

42:45.655 --> 42:46.655
like this,

42:47.550 --> 42:48.520
if you can.

42:48.645 --> 42:51.820
And if it's too big, you just take this
and throw it, and then call me.

42:51.945 --> 42:54.738
And don't ask me how it works,
because I have no idea.

42:54.906 --> 42:56.878
And it doesn't always work.

42:57.003 --> 43:00.505
And don't ingest that stuff,
because you'll...

43:01.329 --> 43:02.329
see things.

43:03.555 --> 43:06.416
And we'll stay in contact with these.
I have one just like it.

43:06.965 --> 43:09.461
- Two-way video communication?
- I call it a Farnsworth.

43:09.975 --> 43:11.421
Named after Philo Farnsworth,

43:12.455 --> 43:15.467
who invented that in 1929,
right after he invented the television.

43:15.835 --> 43:17.820
Isn't that remarkable?
I mean, anyway,

43:17.945 --> 43:20.605
if you wanna talk to me,
just press that button.

43:23.965 --> 43:25.765
What is that?

43:26.205 --> 43:27.437
Nicola Tesla,

43:28.265 --> 43:31.930
Thomas Edison's chief rival
or nemesis, depending,

43:32.055 --> 43:33.405
he cooked this up

43:34.320 --> 43:36.305
as an alternative to bullets.
It's a...

43:36.495 --> 43:37.545
It's really...

43:38.115 --> 43:39.658
a kind of electric stun gun{\, really}.

43:40.985 --> 43:43.161
A polyphase ass-kicker.

43:43.329 --> 43:44.663
Now, that's...

43:45.855 --> 43:48.390
Just here. Just don't put it
past two to begin with.

43:48.515 --> 43:50.020
That's the trigger, right there.

43:50.145 --> 43:52.420
You should practice with it first.
One blast and down you go.

43:54.045 --> 43:55.895
Don't point that at me.
Keep your finger away{\ from the trigger}.

43:56.020 --> 43:56.841
Just don't.

43:58.886 --> 44:00.235
Give him the gun.

44:00.595 --> 44:02.264
And also, it zaps short-term memory,

44:02.432 --> 44:05.684
which is why agent Morris doesn't
remember seeing me at the museum.

44:06.745 --> 44:07.795
And that's it.

44:12.166 --> 44:13.066
That's what?

44:13.234 --> 44:15.520
Go to Iowa.
Talk to Cody.

44:15.645 --> 44:18.947
Find the artifact, if it exists.
Neutralize it and bring it back.

44:22.818 --> 44:23.868
Don't get killed.

44:33.285 --> 44:35.365
- How's her aura?
- Tortured.

44:35.555 --> 44:37.120
Guilt and grief, mostly.

44:37.245 --> 44:39.830
She has a soft spot for the ferret{\, though}.
Just like you.

44:39.955 --> 44:42.268
Now that was a long time ago.

44:42.393 --> 44:44.283
You haven't changed that much.

44:46.215 --> 44:48.765
She had a stowaway.
I found this in her room.

44:49.865 --> 44:51.688
Oh, Lord, that's Houdini's wallet.

44:55.325 --> 44:56.325
Fingers!

45:02.085 --> 45:04.618
That was a bad spike.
That landed on something with her.

45:04.786 --> 45:08.330
I requisitioned mesh screens
for those shelves ten years ago.

45:08.498 --> 45:09.914
And every year since.

45:10.225 --> 45:11.833
- I've told you this.
- A few times.

45:12.345 --> 45:14.669
You'd think Mrs. Frederic
could maybe get that done.

45:15.095 --> 45:16.445
Don't look at me.

45:34.735 --> 45:38.735
Well, I had the FBI in here a while ago
on a suspected terrorist thing.

45:39.721 --> 45:43.746
All egos out to here and all looking
like they're wearing daddy's suit.

45:45.295 --> 45:46.868
Well, we feel the same way.

45:47.375 --> 45:51.000
{\Well, just }Let me know if the{\is} thing's going federal
so I can {\get }prepare{\d} my staff for the media.

45:51.125 --> 45:54.375
It's not going federal. We just have
a few questions and then we're gone.

45:55.544 --> 45:56.544
It's Dickinson.

45:57.922 --> 45:59.835
- {\We'll }Just {\be }a sec.
- Yeah, this is Bering.

46:00.306 --> 46:03.218
- How you doing?
- {\Well, }We're in Iowa now, on assignment.

46:03.625 --> 46:06.262
- Any luck in getting us back?
- The bad news is not so far.

46:06.485 --> 46:09.140
The good news is, I've got a line
on this Frederic woman.

46:09.265 --> 46:11.768
She worked for the Treasury Department
in the 1950s, and after{\ that}...

46:11.936 --> 46:14.600
Well, it's not the same woman.
The woman we met was younger.

46:14.725 --> 46:17.524
<i>I've got a Frederic in charge
of some sort of secret sandbox.</i>

46:17.692 --> 46:20.026
{\It's being }Funded from a black ops budget
I'm still trying to source.

46:20.194 --> 46:21.236
{\Well, }I can fill you in.

46:21.995 --> 46:23.340
These lines aren't secure.

46:23.465 --> 46:26.300
<i>Listen to me. I'm doing everything I can
to get you and Pete back here.</i>

46:26.425 --> 46:27.730
<i>48 hours, tops.</i>

46:27.855 --> 46:30.161
So just follow your current orders
and keep your head down.

46:30.329 --> 46:31.329
Wait, sir!

46:31.831 --> 46:32.831
Sir?

46:34.945 --> 46:36.167
So how'd he sound?

46:36.645 --> 46:37.645
48 hours.

46:38.065 --> 46:40.465
- Yeah, but how'd he sound?
- Not good.

46:45.195 --> 46:47.690
- What kind of questions?
- {\Well, }They're sort of diagnostic.

46:47.815 --> 46:49.097
Diagnostic. {\What, }Like I'm sick?

46:50.535 --> 46:51.933
You're Secret Service doctors?

46:54.165 --> 46:55.353
Question number one.

46:55.478 --> 46:58.272
"Have you recently encountered something
that you feel has affected your life?"

46:58.585 --> 46:59.607
Something like{\ what?}...

47:00.095 --> 47:01.818
An object of some kind.

47:03.365 --> 47:04.696
Do handcuffs count?

47:05.865 --> 47:09.409
Question number two. "While looking up,
do you have the sensation of falling?"

47:21.535 --> 47:23.006
I don't feel like I'm falling.

47:24.205 --> 47:26.800
- Next question.
- Okay, question number three.

47:26.925 --> 47:30.667
"Have you recently smelled something
that could best be described

47:31.915 --> 47:35.310
- "as fudge when there is no fudge?"
- Fudge? Is that...

47:35.478 --> 47:36.519
Question four.

47:36.687 --> 47:39.606
"Do you have ever feel like
this might be a colossal waste of time?"

47:41.205 --> 47:42.255
Okay, so...

47:43.975 --> 47:45.745
We're done with those questions...

47:46.975 --> 47:49.073
What do you think happened
with your girlfriend?

47:50.405 --> 47:51.910
- What's her name?
- I don't know.

47:52.078 --> 47:53.078
Emily.

47:54.789 --> 47:55.789
I don't know.

47:57.025 --> 47:58.303
I don't remember.

47:59.605 --> 48:03.205
I was in class, talking to the professor
about some mock trial thing.

48:04.425 --> 48:06.424
{\Then }I woke up here, and they told me
I beat Emily up.

48:06.592 --> 48:08.665
- Have they let you see a doctor?
- Yeah.

48:09.155 --> 48:10.970
- Says I'm fine.
- And no...

48:12.025 --> 48:15.141
- No alcohol or drugs?
- No, I swear.

48:15.309 --> 48:16.851
No history of blackouts?

48:17.115 --> 48:18.175
This isn't me.

48:18.755 --> 48:21.314
I would never hurt Emily.
This isn't me. This isn't...

48:29.485 --> 48:31.920
<i>Se li uomini sapessino le cagioni</i>

48:32.045 --> 48:35.328
<i>della paura mia,
capir potrebbero il mio dolor.</i>

48:57.393 --> 48:58.715
Get him out of here!

49:00.676 --> 49:02.887
Let's get him down to secure lockup.

49:05.125 --> 49:06.675
Well, that was scary.

49:22.626 --> 49:24.155
{\PUB}{\pos(192,230)}Can you come this way, son?

49:28.235 --> 49:31.033
{\pos(192,230)}Hello. I'm Lorna Soliday.
I'm Cody's lawyer.

49:31.185 --> 49:32.750
And did Travis call you?

49:32.875 --> 49:34.440
Sheriff Travis respects the law,

49:34.565 --> 49:36.670
and he doesn't like
being railroaded by federal agents.

49:36.795 --> 49:39.140
Are you that hands-on
with all your clients?

49:39.265 --> 49:41.090
- Just my godson.
- So you knew his parents.

49:41.215 --> 49:42.070
Very well.

49:42.195 --> 49:45.180
And neither Cody nor I
will be answering any more questions

49:45.305 --> 49:48.550
- until I know what this is about.
- We're interested in Cody's behavior.

49:48.675 --> 49:51.660
- His violent behavior.
- As in, where's it coming from?

49:51.785 --> 49:55.240
What is this? Someone pegged him
as a threat to the President?

49:55.365 --> 49:56.365
Not yet.

49:56.695 --> 49:58.620
Not ever.
That's not Cody.

49:58.969 --> 50:01.306
{\Well, }It was Cody
that just destroyed that table{\ in there}.

50:01.431 --> 50:03.249
Not to mention what he did
to his girlfriend.

50:03.418 --> 50:06.675
Does the secret service
investigate every case

50:06.800 --> 50:10.006
- of battery among college students?
- Nope. Just this one.

50:10.350 --> 50:12.413
- So where'd the Italian come in?
- What do you mean?

50:12.538 --> 50:15.077
He spoke Italian in there,
just before he decided

50:15.202 --> 50:18.102
- that the interview was over.
- I don't know anything about that.

50:18.227 --> 50:20.160
Well, has Cody come into contact

50:20.285 --> 50:22.789
with anything unusual, say,
in the past few days?

50:22.978 --> 50:25.604
- Yes. You two.
- That was a serious question.

50:25.729 --> 50:27.629
That was a serious answer.

50:28.101 --> 50:31.101
Any more questions,
Sheriff Travis has my number.

50:39.869 --> 50:41.419
You felt that, right?

50:42.558 --> 50:44.481
I'm not sure what you mean.

50:44.606 --> 50:45.756
It got hot.

50:50.423 --> 50:53.498
But you knew to get me
to the floor before he freaked out.

50:58.500 --> 50:59.500
The vibe.

51:00.537 --> 51:01.224
Right.

51:02.139 --> 51:04.110
Okay, so how do those things work?

51:04.235 --> 51:05.770
Is there false alarms or...

51:07.675 --> 51:09.774
- It happens all the time.
- So why do you trust them?

51:13.531 --> 51:16.280
One time I didn't,
and I should have.

51:34.038 --> 51:36.503
<i>You're right.
It's Italian, sort of.</i>

51:38.271 --> 51:40.513
I mean, this is either

51:41.014 --> 51:43.266
part gibberish. I don't know.
It's some kind of code, maybe.

51:44.359 --> 51:47.061
<i>And my software can barely
translate any of this and says "dolor"</i>

51:47.834 --> 51:49.105
means "pain."

51:49.982 --> 51:52.244
And a text search
came up with nothing.

51:52.693 --> 51:54.872
There's no films, no books,
no plays, no songs, no poems.

51:54.997 --> 51:56.060
So what now?

51:56.906 --> 51:58.523
You're right beside
a college campus.

51:58.648 --> 52:01.200
You can go find somebody
who speaks Italian.

52:15.908 --> 52:16.908
Excuse me.

52:19.941 --> 52:21.391
Professor Marzotto?

52:22.684 --> 52:24.684
We're with the secret service.

52:26.380 --> 52:27.380
Oh, my.

52:39.931 --> 52:41.507
It's an old construction.

52:41.632 --> 52:42.782
15th century.

52:43.321 --> 52:44.952
It's not working-class Italian
either.

52:46.288 --> 52:47.471
This is high brow.

52:47.957 --> 52:49.624
- So what's he saying?
- Roughly?

52:50.412 --> 52:51.459
"If people knew

52:52.295 --> 52:54.548
"the reasons for my fear,

52:55.262 --> 52:58.086
"they'd be able
to understand my pain."

52:59.202 --> 53:00.635
Do you visit Italy a lot?

53:01.751 --> 53:04.264
I haven't been back
in nearly two years.

53:04.389 --> 53:06.365
But you're sure
this translation is correct.

53:06.725 --> 53:08.851
I'm a Renaissance scholar.
I'm sure.

53:10.105 --> 53:11.145
One last question.

53:11.313 --> 53:13.914
Do you know a student here
named Cody Thomas?

53:14.039 --> 53:15.066
I know of him.

53:15.234 --> 53:17.276
I read about him in the paper.
It's a sad story{\, that}.

53:17.689 --> 53:19.393
- How so?
- Well, you know.

53:19.518 --> 53:21.787
He was a good kid,
from what I heard.

53:22.200 --> 53:23.866
And he had some sort of a breakdown.

53:25.869 --> 53:28.621
All right, well, if we need you
to translate anything else...

53:29.147 --> 53:31.013
I'd be more than happy to help.

53:31.953 --> 53:33.751
You can reach me at that number.

53:34.148 --> 53:35.336
Great. Thank you.

53:36.624 --> 53:39.395
He's hiding something.
Did you see his neck pulse?

53:40.498 --> 53:42.274
Don't you have
a scrupulous eye for detail.

53:42.399 --> 53:45.221
- He shelves his books alphabetically.
- I didn't notice that.

53:45.608 --> 53:48.262
And he puts pens in one cup,
pencils in another.

53:48.387 --> 53:49.525
Now you're scaring me.

53:49.650 --> 53:52.023
Did you see where he put his pen
right before we left?

53:52.148 --> 53:54.587
Was Sherlock Holmes a big deal
at your parents' bookstore?

53:54.712 --> 53:56.964
- Something got Marzotto going.
- And you.

53:57.089 --> 53:58.562
I don't like being lied to.

53:58.687 --> 54:00.968
I'll remember that. {\So, what? }Do you want
to go back and hit him again?

54:01.093 --> 54:02.531
No, I want a hard phone line.

54:02.656 --> 54:04.468
I thought this was
a colossal waste of time.

54:04.593 --> 54:05.707
Not anymore.

54:06.371 --> 54:07.280
Hold up.

54:07.405 --> 54:09.344
- Do you always walk so fast?
- Yes, I do.

54:09.469 --> 54:10.719
Are you coming?

54:48.975 --> 54:51.350
<i>I have an incoming
code Madrid for Minnie Harris.</i>

54:51.475 --> 54:52.810
Reply 6955.

54:53.477 --> 54:55.539
- Hi, Minnie.
- Hey, hotshot.

54:55.905 --> 54:58.085
- How's the White House?
- <i>You know, it's a lot smaller</i>

54:58.261 --> 54:59.837
than it looks on TV.
How are you?

55:00.097 --> 55:02.215
- Chad and I are dating.
- <i>Very nice.</i>

55:02.489 --> 55:03.604
<i>Yes, it is.</i>

55:03.729 --> 55:06.042
- Look, I need some information.
- <i>Okay, shoot.</i>

55:06.167 --> 55:08.855
Edward Marzotto, one "z" two "t"s.

55:08.980 --> 55:11.682
- <i>Professor at Southern Iowa University.</i>
- Turnaround?

55:11.850 --> 55:13.976
I need it now.
Sorry, I know this is big.

55:14.167 --> 55:15.603
<i>It's not a problem.</i>

55:15.771 --> 55:17.521
{\You can }Hang on and
I'll give you the highlights?

55:17.689 --> 55:19.273
- For sure.
- <i>Thanks. Hang on.</i>

55:21.717 --> 55:23.298
I'm sorry to bother you.

55:25.152 --> 55:28.013
Government agents are asking me
lots of questions I can't answer

55:28.138 --> 55:30.610
without getting you and me
into a lot of trouble.

55:31.495 --> 55:32.995
It's about the book.

55:33.547 --> 55:35.972
Your boyfriend is quoting from it.

55:41.922 --> 55:42.797
<i>How's Myka?</i>

55:43.448 --> 55:44.674
Edgy, irritable.

55:44.842 --> 55:46.048
You know, Myka.

55:46.518 --> 55:48.477
- Why?
- <i>Just checking.</i>

55:50.384 --> 55:51.597
Listen,

55:52.066 --> 55:54.041
<i>there's something
I forgot to mention before.</i>

55:54.166 --> 55:56.686
- What?
- <i>Just before Cody got physical,</i>

55:57.637 --> 55:59.346
<i>there was some kind of a...</i>

56:00.069 --> 56:02.013
<i>I don't know, a heat wave.</i>

56:02.693 --> 56:04.581
It just rolled right off of him.

56:04.952 --> 56:06.654
<i>This happen after a question?</i>

56:07.076 --> 56:10.241
No, he was talking
about his girlfriend, Emily Krueger.

56:10.409 --> 56:12.390
- <i>You talked to her, right?</i>
- No, not yet.

56:12.641 --> 56:13.974
<i>All right. Listen,</i>

56:14.705 --> 56:18.453
I'm gonna check out that heat thing,
and {\I'm gonna }see if that relates to anything.

56:18.578 --> 56:19.333
And...

56:19.698 --> 56:22.003
<i>meanwhile,
what was that translation?</i>

56:25.215 --> 56:27.967
<i>"If people knew
the reasons for my fear,</i>

56:28.135 --> 56:30.511
"they would be able
to understand my pain."

56:36.476 --> 56:38.978
Do you want me to...
Do you want me to run that again?

56:39.347 --> 56:40.347
I got it.

56:42.153 --> 56:44.525
<i>You're positive
that's the translation?</i>

56:44.941 --> 56:46.025
<i>Absolutely positive?</i>

56:46.327 --> 56:48.696
Yeah, I mean,
that's what Marzotto said.

56:51.068 --> 56:52.877
- I'll call you back.
- <i>Okay.</i>

56:57.075 --> 56:58.289
<i>Got some good stuff.</i>

56:58.526 --> 57:00.041
Edward Melville Marzotto.

57:00.729 --> 57:02.043
- Melville?
- <i>Yeah, I know.</i>

57:02.462 --> 57:04.544
Anyway, the man loves
his Italian art.

57:04.889 --> 57:06.741
He just got back
from Italy eight weeks ago,

57:06.866 --> 57:08.358
and the cops think...

57:11.807 --> 57:13.054
<i>Hey, bunny.</i>

57:19.234 --> 57:21.028
- Slow down.
- Walk faster.

57:21.577 --> 57:23.105
So what'd you find out?

57:25.615 --> 57:26.967
What happened in there?

57:28.498 --> 57:29.498
Tell me.

57:35.316 --> 57:36.160
I heard a...

57:38.144 --> 57:40.206
I thought I heard... a voice

57:40.673 --> 57:43.756
over the phone that I really
should not be hearing.

57:45.723 --> 57:47.714
Same thing you heard at Leena's.

57:50.717 --> 57:53.344
Look, sometimes we...
We hear things

57:53.512 --> 57:56.930
- and see things that aren't there.
- What I heard can't be there.

57:57.685 --> 57:59.809
- It can't be.
- Then it's not.

58:00.163 --> 58:03.468
I mean,
maybe it's post-traumatic stress.

58:09.083 --> 58:11.445
I read the press release
of what went down in Denver.

58:12.232 --> 58:14.365
- Lives were saved.
- Lives were lost.

58:15.394 --> 58:16.659
You're a hero.

58:18.986 --> 58:21.122
You're gonna put me
on a psych eval, aren't you?

58:21.985 --> 58:23.064
Why would I do that?

58:23.231 --> 58:25.960
Because you need to be able
to depend on your partner.

58:29.734 --> 58:32.542
All right, well,
then you're just gonna have

58:32.667 --> 58:35.469
to depend on me
to know that you're okay.

58:37.764 --> 58:40.549
We're gonna finish this case,
we're gonna get out of here. We will.

58:40.674 --> 58:42.153
I don't know if I can.

58:42.612 --> 58:44.558
I don't even know
what we're looking for.

58:44.683 --> 58:45.691
Yes, you do.

58:45.816 --> 58:47.481
I mean, whatever doesn't fit.

58:48.052 --> 58:50.484
You know, something
that's out of place.

58:55.615 --> 58:58.327
Marzotto lied to us.
He said that the last time

58:58.452 --> 59:00.741
- he was in Italy was...
- Two years ago.

59:00.866 --> 59:03.553
Yeah, my contact told me
it was eight weeks ago.

59:04.411 --> 59:05.833
How'bout that?

59:06.454 --> 59:08.471
I wonder what else he lied about.

59:08.596 --> 59:11.645
- I guess we need more information.
- Yes, we do.

59:11.770 --> 59:14.047
- Cody's girlfriend.
- Emily Krueger.

59:16.792 --> 59:18.142
{\pub}I need a picture!

59:20.056 --> 59:21.599
{\pos(192,240)}Just give me a picture.

59:25.999 --> 59:27.399
{\pos(192,240)}Give me a picture.

59:30.244 --> 59:32.303
{\pos(192,230)}Don't make me come down there!

59:38.686 --> 59:39.686
All right.

59:43.439 --> 59:44.791
I know this is...

59:45.460 --> 59:46.460
awkward.

59:47.198 --> 59:49.239
And I feel terrible, but...

59:51.399 --> 59:52.505
You can't keep it.

59:53.778 --> 59:56.983
I don't know what I was thinking
even taking it out of Italy,

59:57.869 --> 59:59.345
but it has to go back.

01:00:00.832 --> 01:00:02.621
I'm going to Rome next week.

01:00:03.259 --> 01:00:05.059
And that's coming with me.

01:00:10.082 --> 01:00:11.148
What's that for?

01:01:31.417 --> 01:01:32.405
I hate this part.

01:01:56.883 --> 01:01:58.976
- Emily, you're late.
- Sorry.

01:02:02.761 --> 01:02:04.690
We were setting up for the party.

01:02:05.574 --> 01:02:06.853
Can I help you?

01:02:06.978 --> 01:02:08.339
Emily Krueger?

01:02:44.913 --> 01:02:46.845
I know your pain, trust me.

01:03:02.910 --> 01:03:06.241
We saw you leaving
professor Marzotto's office, didn't we?

01:03:06.428 --> 01:03:07.324
Oh, right.

01:03:08.110 --> 01:03:09.357
I was there for a meeting.

01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:11.330
For the play.

01:03:12.414 --> 01:03:14.832
I'm in it.
Marzotto's sort of a technical advisor.

01:03:15.308 --> 01:03:17.251
Does he know
about your relationship with Cody?

01:03:17.419 --> 01:03:19.545
He knows what happened.
Why?

01:03:20.099 --> 01:03:23.255
Because when we talked to him
about Cody, he didn't mention you.

01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:24.893
Or that you'd just been to see him.

01:03:25.018 --> 01:03:27.469
Maybe he was trying
to protect my privacy.

01:03:29.097 --> 01:03:31.810
- Why did you guys mention Cody?
- We needed something translated.

01:03:31.935 --> 01:03:34.101
Yeah, have you ever heard
Cody speak Italian?

01:03:34.269 --> 01:03:35.269
Just once,

01:03:36.509 --> 01:03:37.671
when he did this.

01:03:37.939 --> 01:03:40.962
- How long have you known Cody?
- Since the eighth grade.

01:03:41.610 --> 01:03:43.813
Got serious after his parents died.

01:03:44.376 --> 01:03:45.814
I came here for theater.

01:03:45.939 --> 01:03:47.739
He applied for law school.

01:03:48.064 --> 01:03:50.200
His godmother helped him get in.

01:03:50.368 --> 01:03:52.202
- Lorna Soliday?
- You met her?

01:03:52.370 --> 01:03:54.456
- Does she have any family?
- Just Cody.

01:03:54.789 --> 01:03:56.540
And that's not even real family.

01:03:57.487 --> 01:04:00.217
She made sure that he got that big
settlement when his parents died.

01:04:04.916 --> 01:04:06.550
Do you know what it means?

01:04:07.039 --> 01:04:08.969
"If people knew
the reasons for my fear,

01:04:09.137 --> 01:04:11.294
"they would be able
to understand my pain."

01:04:11.419 --> 01:04:15.359
- Does that mean anything to you?
- Only that he's afraid of abandonment.

01:04:15.484 --> 01:04:16.684
It scares him.

01:04:17.252 --> 01:04:20.063
Maybe he thought that I was spending
too much time on the play.

01:04:21.572 --> 01:04:23.525
I don't know.
Can I go back to work now?

01:05:15.286 --> 01:05:18.350
{\pub}Ten to one this has nothing to do
with the hocus pocus Artie's pushing.

01:05:18.475 --> 01:05:20.637
{\pos(192,230)}How'bout a billion to one?

01:05:34.780 --> 01:05:36.830
{\pos(192,230)}What kind of women do you date?

01:06:18.835 --> 01:06:20.401
- It's Marzotto.
- What?

01:06:20.526 --> 01:06:24.362
The attendant said he heard him speaking
Italian before he doused himself.

01:06:24.963 --> 01:06:25.963
Hold on.

01:06:26.398 --> 01:06:27.971
Why'd you talk to marzotto?

01:06:28.581 --> 01:06:29.880
Who told you that?

01:06:30.225 --> 01:06:32.946
Secret service hits campus,
and people notice. And now he's dead.

01:06:33.213 --> 01:06:36.450
Before this, you said something to make
Cody{\ Thomas} want to knock your heads off.

01:06:37.276 --> 01:06:39.411
- {\Is there }Something you want to tell me?
- We should talk{\ about this} later.

01:06:39.579 --> 01:06:41.663
- Let me tell you something...
- Sure.

01:06:41.788 --> 01:06:43.132
{\Tell me }Something that makes it seem

01:06:43.257 --> 01:06:45.249
like I couldn't kick your ass
in front of your men.

01:06:45.419 --> 01:06:48.503
Boys, can we put our badges
back in our pants, please?

01:06:48.671 --> 01:06:49.671
Sheriff.

01:06:54.791 --> 01:06:55.991
What was that?

01:06:56.343 --> 01:06:59.864
- We gotta get to Marzotto's office.
- And how are we gonna get in?

01:07:00.574 --> 01:07:01.391
Hotshot.

01:07:01.959 --> 01:07:03.109
What the hell

01:07:03.683 --> 01:07:05.103
is Warehouse 13?

01:07:13.522 --> 01:07:16.322
We haven't met.
I'm Mrs. Frederic.

01:07:16.492 --> 01:07:18.909
- How'd you get in here?
- Through a door.

01:07:22.602 --> 01:07:24.539
Warehouse 13, is it yours?

01:07:24.853 --> 01:07:25.853
It's mine.

01:07:26.166 --> 01:07:27.751
And so are Lattimer and Bering.

01:07:27.919 --> 01:07:28.794
Excuse me?

01:07:39.479 --> 01:07:41.179
Can I ask you something?

01:07:43.219 --> 01:07:44.219
Shoot.

01:07:46.196 --> 01:07:47.246
Never mind.

01:07:48.137 --> 01:07:49.387
The vibe thing?

01:07:51.481 --> 01:07:52.656
My dad was a...

01:07:53.756 --> 01:07:54.778
fireman.

01:07:55.795 --> 01:07:56.995
When I was 12,

01:07:58.769 --> 01:08:02.330
I got this feeling one morning
that I was never gonna see him again.

01:08:03.408 --> 01:08:04.913
And you didn't say anything?

01:08:05.081 --> 01:08:07.860
I didn't want him
to see how scared I was.

01:08:09.507 --> 01:08:12.770
He died that night in a house fire,
saving a couple of kids.

01:08:14.885 --> 01:08:15.885
I'm sorry.

01:08:18.488 --> 01:08:19.488
Me too.

01:08:22.261 --> 01:08:24.225
So now when you get a feeling...

01:08:35.180 --> 01:08:38.863
- He got his pen out of his pencil cup.
- At least he died happy.

01:08:39.551 --> 01:08:40.901
That's not funny.

01:08:41.465 --> 01:08:42.615
You're right.

01:08:48.647 --> 01:08:49.791
That's strange.

01:08:50.448 --> 01:08:51.501
What?

01:08:52.170 --> 01:08:53.881
The "m"s are out of order.

01:08:55.506 --> 01:08:57.200
There's something in there.

01:09:05.687 --> 01:09:07.627
- Is this it?
- I don't know.

01:09:08.420 --> 01:09:10.774
- Well, what if it is?
- Then we're done.

01:09:11.770 --> 01:09:13.148
- So open it.
- You open it.

01:09:13.316 --> 01:09:15.524
I don't want another ferret
or whatever.

01:09:39.091 --> 01:09:40.814
- <i>Se li uomini...</i>
- Don't.

01:09:42.444 --> 01:09:43.595
Just in case.

01:09:48.916 --> 01:09:51.187
- What's that?
- Something's missing.

01:09:51.645 --> 01:09:53.063
Let's call Artie.

01:09:58.386 --> 01:09:59.569
Miss Soliday.

01:09:59.842 --> 01:10:02.951
- What are you doing here?
- You heard what happened to Marzotto?

01:10:03.076 --> 01:10:04.920
Yes, Sheriff Travis just called.

01:10:05.045 --> 01:10:06.953
Now get out before I call him back

01:10:07.078 --> 01:10:09.371
and tell him you're searching
this office without a warrant.

01:10:09.827 --> 01:10:12.027
We're here
investigating his suicide.

01:10:14.451 --> 01:10:15.993
Ed didn't kill himself.

01:10:16.700 --> 01:10:18.338
- He had help.
- What do you mean?

01:10:19.770 --> 01:10:21.508
Somebody broke his heart.

01:10:26.389 --> 01:10:28.377
We were together for three years.

01:10:29.829 --> 01:10:31.970
And then we weren't.

01:10:32.927 --> 01:10:34.771
I thought we were in love,

01:10:36.393 --> 01:10:38.274
but things change,
and he chose someone else.

01:10:38.453 --> 01:10:39.401
A student?

01:10:39.526 --> 01:10:41.054
Did Emily Krueger break his heart?

01:10:41.179 --> 01:10:42.070
And Cody's.

01:10:42.391 --> 01:10:45.638
She's a despicable young woman
who uses people to get what she wants,

01:10:45.826 --> 01:10:47.575
and then when she's done
using them...

01:10:48.305 --> 01:10:50.996
We're looking for something,
something about this big.

01:10:51.202 --> 01:10:53.790
We think Marzotto had it,
but now it's missing.

01:10:53.958 --> 01:10:55.763
Did Emily get it,
you know, whatever it is?

01:10:55.888 --> 01:10:57.287
Why don't you ask her?

01:10:57.412 --> 01:10:59.588
She's helping with the party
for the play.

01:11:00.305 --> 01:11:01.211
Cody's there.

01:11:01.336 --> 01:11:03.300
- Cody's out?
- Emily dropped the charges.

01:11:04.138 --> 01:11:06.766
- Okay, we should go.
- I'm coming with you.

01:11:06.891 --> 01:11:09.931
If you're confronting Emily,
I need to be there for Cody.

01:11:10.919 --> 01:11:11.919
Let's go.

01:11:31.538 --> 01:11:32.871
I gotta lose weight.

01:11:38.419 --> 01:11:40.534
Do you think Emily
would ever hurt Cody?

01:11:41.453 --> 01:11:42.623
Not physically.

01:11:43.014 --> 01:11:44.915
Even if she tried, she couldn't.

01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:46.009
And why not?

01:11:47.158 --> 01:11:47.886
Me.

01:11:49.180 --> 01:11:50.246
Cody has me.

01:11:51.349 --> 01:11:54.601
I made a promise to his parents
when I became his godmother

01:11:55.519 --> 01:11:58.112
that I would always be there

01:11:58.901 --> 01:12:00.023
to protect him.

01:12:02.568 --> 01:12:05.946
It's only a matter of time
before Cody realizes

01:12:06.114 --> 01:12:08.476
Emily's just small-town trash.

01:12:09.699 --> 01:12:12.698
Cody is destined for great things,

01:12:12.823 --> 01:12:14.996
and I'm helping him succeed.

01:12:15.201 --> 01:12:19.137
With me, he can do anything
or be anyone he wants.

01:12:21.754 --> 01:12:23.519
Could you pull over for a sec?

01:13:09.222 --> 01:13:10.222
{\pub}I know you.

01:13:12.119 --> 01:13:14.097
Well, that's a good sign.

01:13:16.691 --> 01:13:17.738
Where am I?

01:13:18.862 --> 01:13:19.862
Hospital.

01:13:20.223 --> 01:13:21.285
In Iowa.

01:13:21.831 --> 01:13:22.878
Seever City.

01:13:25.223 --> 01:13:26.151
What happened?

01:13:26.876 --> 01:13:27.969
Car accident.

01:13:28.949 --> 01:13:30.613
You've been out for two days.

01:13:35.188 --> 01:13:36.282
How's Pete?

01:13:37.409 --> 01:13:39.331
Lattimer's still unconscious.

01:13:39.499 --> 01:13:40.665
We don't know.

01:13:43.863 --> 01:13:45.835
There's someone here to see you.

01:13:46.809 --> 01:13:49.815
Someone who's gonna help you
get back to where you belong.

01:13:49.940 --> 01:13:50.842
The President?

01:13:55.096 --> 01:13:56.096
Better.

01:14:03.439 --> 01:14:04.472
Hey, bunny.

01:14:06.473 --> 01:14:07.567
Hey.

01:14:07.735 --> 01:14:09.736
You know you shouldn't
be here, right?

01:14:10.723 --> 01:14:13.198
I could say
the same thing about you.

01:14:14.722 --> 01:14:16.260
I think you just did.

01:14:19.848 --> 01:14:20.997
I'm hurt.

01:14:21.165 --> 01:14:22.706
That didn't stop you in Denver.

01:14:23.971 --> 01:14:25.970
- I was late.
- No, bunny.

01:14:26.375 --> 01:14:27.438
I was early.

01:14:28.223 --> 01:14:29.470
I jumped the gun.

01:14:31.371 --> 01:14:32.859
You're dead, Sam.

01:14:36.243 --> 01:14:38.014
You need to get up now.

01:14:38.732 --> 01:14:40.767
You got a lot of things
you need to do.

01:14:43.220 --> 01:14:44.220
Get up.

01:14:47.410 --> 01:14:48.920
You have to get up now.

01:14:50.778 --> 01:14:51.528
Get up.

01:15:18.861 --> 01:15:20.047
Wake up, buddy.

01:15:20.470 --> 01:15:21.686
Can you hear me?

01:15:22.409 --> 01:15:23.409
Come on.

01:15:24.146 --> 01:15:25.061
Here we go.

01:15:27.601 --> 01:15:28.601
All right.

01:15:28.882 --> 01:15:30.594
- Wait, wait, wait.
- What? What? What?

01:15:30.719 --> 01:15:32.719
- You're giving me a wedgie.
- What?

01:15:33.890 --> 01:15:36.347
Just... you okay?

01:15:39.283 --> 01:15:41.564
Sit here and don't move.

01:15:41.689 --> 01:15:42.996
I'm just gonna get the book.

01:15:43.879 --> 01:15:45.373
If you find a badge, it's mine.

01:15:48.419 --> 01:15:49.419
Never mind.

01:15:50.713 --> 01:15:51.588
I found it.

01:16:00.656 --> 01:16:01.656
You okay?

01:16:08.346 --> 01:16:09.772
Soliday crashed the car.

01:16:10.060 --> 01:16:11.215
You think?

01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:13.359
Where is she?

01:16:14.345 --> 01:16:15.592
She's not here.

01:16:16.096 --> 01:16:16.905
She had...

01:16:18.403 --> 01:16:21.930
some kind of jewelry in her hair,
like a comb thing.

01:16:22.663 --> 01:16:25.455
It looked old,
like it would fit in the book.

01:16:26.969 --> 01:16:29.154
- Pete, you're bleeding.
- I'm fine.

01:16:29.279 --> 01:16:30.280
I'm fine.

01:16:31.121 --> 01:16:32.615
Just... here, answer that.

01:16:38.072 --> 01:16:40.345
You're looking for jewelry.
This, this thing.

01:16:40.470 --> 01:16:42.408
Yeah, we know.
We just saw it in a woman's hair.

01:16:42.533 --> 01:16:44.905
- She tried to kill us.
- A woman? What woman?

01:16:45.276 --> 01:16:47.602
<i>Her name is Lorna Soliday. She's...</i>

01:16:47.770 --> 01:16:50.031
Part of the ruling class, single,
successful{\. She's}, middle-aged.

01:16:50.156 --> 01:16:52.732
She's a survivor of family tragedies
and the death of loved ones.

01:16:52.900 --> 01:16:56.819
<i>{\And s}She's connected somehow to a young man,
{\a young man }that she believes needs her protection?</i>

01:16:58.323 --> 01:16:59.405
He's good, yeah.

01:16:59.573 --> 01:17:01.115
<i>What's the matter with you two?{\Are you two all right?}</i>

01:17:01.283 --> 01:17:05.287
Okay, anyway, look. This comb
is transmitting Lucretia Borgia.

01:17:05.918 --> 01:17:07.221
- Lucretia who?
- Borgia.

01:17:07.346 --> 01:17:09.158
She's a cutthroat Italian
who ruled Italy

01:17:09.283 --> 01:17:11.501
in the 1600s
with her father and brothers.

01:17:13.651 --> 01:17:15.322
My family owned a book store,
remember?

01:17:15.447 --> 01:17:16.340
That's right.

01:17:16.465 --> 01:17:18.407
So what do you mean
the comb's transmitting?

01:17:18.593 --> 01:17:20.510
An alchemist made it, okay?

01:17:20.678 --> 01:17:22.178
<i>Out of what, I don't know.</i>

01:17:22.347 --> 01:17:25.223
It's supposed to be some kind
of Renaissance roofie.

01:17:25.404 --> 01:17:29.269
Somehow the crystals in the ionized
metal {\in this thing }are affecting brain chemistry.

01:17:29.437 --> 01:17:31.396
- What about the phrase?
- <i>Yeah, the phrase.</i>

01:17:31.564 --> 01:17:33.439
<i>That's like
some kind of phonetic trigger.</i>

01:17:33.607 --> 01:17:35.942
This is a very, very,
very unhappy woman.

01:17:36.354 --> 01:17:38.048
Very unlucky in love.

01:17:38.592 --> 01:17:41.948
- There's supposed to be a jewelry box.
- <i>We found it in Marzotto's office.</i>

01:17:42.627 --> 01:17:44.784
<i>He must have given Soliday the comb.</i>

01:17:44.953 --> 01:17:47.357
Like her,
she wants love at any cost.

01:17:47.482 --> 01:17:50.206
She wants love,
and she is gonna kill to get it.

01:17:50.375 --> 01:17:53.547
She wants... She wants Cody,
so she wants Emily gone.

01:17:53.672 --> 01:17:55.045
And Emily's at the party.

01:17:55.170 --> 01:17:57.047
<i>What are you talking about a party?
{\Party? }What party?</i>

01:17:57.172 --> 01:17:58.006
God.

01:17:58.174 --> 01:18:00.048
Some renaissance blowout

01:18:00.218 --> 01:18:02.284
for some Machiavelli play.

01:18:02.409 --> 01:18:05.888
Machia... This woman's gonna be there?
You've gotta stop this woman.

01:18:06.057 --> 01:18:08.682
Lucretia Borgia, 600 years ago,
started a bloody reign of terror,

01:18:08.860 --> 01:18:11.936
and this comb is gonna
wanna start it all over again.

01:18:12.104 --> 01:18:13.915
It's got twisted desires,
and it'll amplify,

01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:16.899
it'll spread like some kind
of orgiastic virus.

01:18:17.068 --> 01:18:19.611
First to Iowa, then to Nebraska,
then to Illinois.

01:18:19.736 --> 01:18:20.671
We understand.

01:18:20.796 --> 01:18:23.114
Probably first
to Illinois and then...

01:18:25.213 --> 01:18:28.296
Okay, look, we need to get you
to a hospital first and...

01:18:29.630 --> 01:18:32.369
No, look, I'm trained
to take a bullet

01:18:32.785 --> 01:18:33.708
if necessary.

01:18:34.794 --> 01:18:35.794
But...

01:18:37.295 --> 01:18:40.673
I'm not sure how to stop
a dead Italian cougar.

01:20:32.530 --> 01:20:34.541
{\pub} We need some kind of approach.

01:20:35.893 --> 01:20:38.157
Well, I have no more
color-coded plans.

01:20:39.045 --> 01:20:40.677
There's a silver lining.

01:20:43.227 --> 01:20:44.922
Okay, I'll go in, grab Cody.

01:20:45.091 --> 01:20:46.945
- You flank.
- No, you flank.

01:20:48.376 --> 01:20:49.376
Trust me.

01:21:07.844 --> 01:21:09.447
That's not creepy.

01:21:29.757 --> 01:21:31.127
How you doing?

01:21:32.355 --> 01:21:33.464
That's nice.

01:22:09.058 --> 01:22:10.925
Come on, man,
you don't wanna do this.

01:22:13.970 --> 01:22:14.970
Look.

01:22:17.808 --> 01:22:19.375
You don't wanna hurt her.

01:22:19.984 --> 01:22:21.936
Just let Emily go.

01:22:22.329 --> 01:22:23.687
He intends to.

01:22:23.941 --> 01:22:26.190
Her dying scream
will be the trigger...

01:22:27.110 --> 01:22:29.485
Look, nobody's screaming, okay?

01:22:30.124 --> 01:22:32.905
We're gonna take a deep breath, and
we're all gonna come back down to Earth.

01:22:44.361 --> 01:22:45.084
Cute.

01:22:49.632 --> 01:22:50.767
Kid's fast.

01:22:53.666 --> 01:22:55.268
What's your pain, Lorna?

01:22:56.189 --> 01:22:57.388
What are you afraid of?

01:22:57.689 --> 01:22:58.751
You know.

01:22:59.754 --> 01:23:01.017
And so does she.

01:23:03.628 --> 01:23:04.814
Show's over.

01:23:07.565 --> 01:23:10.169
Drop the comb... thing.

01:23:10.444 --> 01:23:12.528
Did you really let your lover die?

01:23:14.999 --> 01:23:17.116
- Shut up.
- For a chance at glory?

01:23:17.285 --> 01:23:19.702
I said shut up.

01:23:23.911 --> 01:23:25.499
Don't look at it, Myka.

01:24:07.910 --> 01:24:09.034
Yeah, sorry.

01:24:10.250 --> 01:24:12.005
No one's dying here tonight.

01:24:12.548 --> 01:24:14.590
But you might lose a tooth.

01:24:31.007 --> 01:24:32.357
Duck and cover?

01:25:12.606 --> 01:25:15.401
- What did I do?
- It's okay. It's over.

01:26:05.439 --> 01:26:06.810
Love hurts, I know.

01:26:28.797 --> 01:26:30.809
<i>So here's the deal.
You got a choice.</i>

01:26:30.934 --> 01:26:33.623
<i>You can come back to DC.
Or you can stay with the new assignment.</i>

01:26:33.748 --> 01:26:35.855
- What's the catch?
- <i>I only get you.</i>

01:26:36.311 --> 01:26:37.817
Lattimer has to stay there.

01:26:38.437 --> 01:26:41.070
- And if I stay, what happens to Pete?
- He still stays.

01:26:43.060 --> 01:26:45.950
- How long do I have to think about it?
- About five more seconds.

01:26:46.873 --> 01:26:50.204
Four, three, two.
