WEBVTT

00:04.104 --> 00:05.696
(DISCO MUSIC PLAYING)

00:07.874 --> 00:11.071
Hey, ladies and gentlemen, for the
first time ever in her new part-time job

00:11.144 --> 00:14.705
in the Public Health Department at City
Hall, it's Ann Meredith Perkins! Yay!

00:14.781 --> 00:16.715
Leslie, this is so nice!

00:16.816 --> 00:18.579
I put a poisonous gas
in one of these balloons,

00:18.685 --> 00:20.710
so if any of them pops,
you may die.

00:20.787 --> 00:23.221
No, April,
we would all die.

00:23.289 --> 00:27.316
Gases fill the volume of
whatever container they're in.

00:27.394 --> 00:28.554
School.

00:28.628 --> 00:30.994
We have activities every hour
on your first day.

00:31.064 --> 00:33.396
10:00 am, " Ann's first
day waffle explosion."

00:33.466 --> 00:35.934
11:00 a.m.,
"The start-paperwork jamboree."

00:36.002 --> 00:40.063
And then 12:00 noon sharp is
the inaugural "D-Ann-ce Party."

00:40.740 --> 00:42.571
Welcome to City Hall,
cupcake!

00:42.642 --> 00:45.133
How many of you are in here?
LESLIE: There's seven.

00:45.211 --> 00:48.271
And you have an office mate. His name
is Stuart, and he's kind of a grouch.

00:48.348 --> 00:49.906
I have an office mate?

00:49.983 --> 00:52.110
Get these (BLEEP) balloons
out of here.

00:53.153 --> 00:54.484
Hi, I'm Ann.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:15.008 --> 01:16.066
Hey.
Hey.

01:16.142 --> 01:19.043
Just to let you know, I gave the
senior center project to Donna.

01:19.112 --> 01:20.807
Sounds good.
The meeting's at 2:00?

01:20.880 --> 01:22.472
Yes. Conference room "C".

01:22.549 --> 01:24.483
Okay. I think
at some point,

01:24.551 --> 01:27.145
you and I should probably
make out with each other.

01:27.220 --> 01:28.278
Yeah, good call.

01:28.521 --> 01:30.546
The best part of any
relationship is the beginning.

01:30.890 --> 01:32.482
No problems, no fights.

01:32.559 --> 01:35.255
Just white wine, cuddling,

01:35.328 --> 01:39.492
and crazy amounts of History
Channel documentaries.

01:40.166 --> 01:42.430
Hey, we should take separate
cars to the restaurant tonight.

01:42.502 --> 01:45.266
Chris is deadly serious about this...
I know.

01:45.338 --> 01:48.466
I just don't wanna talk about it, okay?
I'll see you tonight.

01:48.741 --> 01:53.906
Okay. By the way, I have a
meeting with Marlene Griggs-Knope.

01:54.447 --> 01:56.347
Is that any relation?

01:56.716 --> 01:57.705
No.

01:57.784 --> 01:58.808
Oh, okay.

01:58.952 --> 02:02.080
Just a coincidence. We get it
all the time. We laugh about it.

02:02.489 --> 02:03.649
But I've never met her.

02:03.723 --> 02:05.918
She's Filipino.
Okay, bye.

02:08.161 --> 02:10.151
Why don't you just tell Ben
she's your mother?

02:10.229 --> 02:13.324
Because Ben and I are in this
amazing little bubble right now,

02:13.399 --> 02:15.026
and there's
no room in here

02:15.135 --> 02:18.935
for Chris <i>'</i> stupid rules about us not
dating or my ball-busting mother.

02:19.005 --> 02:21.940
Leslie, I'm sorry, but I don't
think you thought this through.

02:22.008 --> 02:23.873
You know what I should do?
I should get my mother

02:23.943 --> 02:25.911
a one-way ticket to London,
leaving today.

02:25.979 --> 02:27.571
And that way,
Ben never has to meet her

02:27.647 --> 02:30.343
and I could visit her in London.
Everybody wins.

02:30.450 --> 02:32.884
What if he sees a picture
of her on your desk?

02:32.986 --> 02:35.079
What if Marlene says, "Hey,
have you met my daughter, Leslie?

02:35.155 --> 02:36.554
"She works in
the Parks Department."

02:37.390 --> 02:39.620
Stuart, please,
could you give us, like, 45 minutes?

02:39.893 --> 02:41.861
It's my office, too.
Stuart.

02:44.097 --> 02:45.223
That guy was rude.

02:45.465 --> 02:47.365
I feel that some
structural changes

02:47.433 --> 02:49.458
could really unlock
this department's potential.

02:50.203 --> 02:51.397
Jerry.
Mmm?

02:51.471 --> 02:53.666
I believe you are
capable of much more.

02:54.474 --> 02:55.634
I'm not.
Nonsense.

02:55.708 --> 02:57.198
Look in the mirror.
Huh?

02:57.377 --> 03:02.076
You are an intelligent, charismatic,
beautiful superhero.

03:02.148 --> 03:04.048
I'm making you head
of Public Relations,

03:04.117 --> 03:06.711
which means you'll be leading
the daily briefing sessions.

03:06.786 --> 03:07.912
Excellent idea.

03:07.987 --> 03:12.083
This is my favorite part about
having a new city manager.

03:12.158 --> 03:15.355
They always try to shake things up,
and their ideas are terrible,

03:15.461 --> 03:18.953
and it brings City Hall
to a grinding halt.

03:19.032 --> 03:22.490
I just grab a few donuts,
sit back, and enjoy the show.

03:23.002 --> 03:25.527
April, you are
too valuable

03:25.605 --> 03:27.368
to just be
Ron's assistant.

03:27.440 --> 03:29.908
So from now on,
you are a multitasking executive aide,

03:30.109 --> 03:31.576
assisting
the entire office.

03:31.644 --> 03:33.305
Is this a nightmare?

03:33.379 --> 03:34.710
April, wake up.

03:35.014 --> 03:36.106
Tom, I just wanna say

03:36.182 --> 03:40.585
that you are a wonderful employee
and a terrific human being.

03:40.720 --> 03:42.051
Meeting adjourned!

03:42.322 --> 03:43.653
Tom. (LAUGHING)

03:44.390 --> 03:45.982
I enjoy you.

03:46.092 --> 03:48.424
You know what else I enjoy?
Your entrepreneurial spirit.

03:48.761 --> 03:51.389
I did recently sell
my <i>Chronicles of Riddick</i> DVD

03:51.464 --> 03:53.125
on eBay for $10.

03:53.199 --> 03:54.928
Used the profits
to buy the Blu-ray.

03:55.001 --> 03:57.162
That's terrific.
I have an amazing project

03:57.237 --> 03:58.431
for someone
of your talents.

03:58.972 --> 04:00.234
You are going to digitize

04:00.306 --> 04:02.536
the entire city archives
up on the fourth floor.

04:02.609 --> 04:05.169
No! I hate the fourth floor!
Last time I was up there,

04:05.245 --> 04:08.510
I saw someone buy crystal meth out of
a vending machine. It's a bad place.

04:08.615 --> 04:10.276
You won't be alone. Andy.

04:10.717 --> 04:13.481
Starting now,
you are nobody's shoeshine boy.

04:13.720 --> 04:16.985
Starting now, you are
an administrative assistant.

04:18.057 --> 04:19.991
For three weeks.
Then back to shoes.

04:20.059 --> 04:22.084
Chris!

04:22.161 --> 04:23.389
I wasn't super
paying attention

04:23.529 --> 04:24.757
to what you just said
that we'll be doing,

04:24.831 --> 04:26.264
but I will give
110 percent!

04:27.467 --> 04:30.561
Well, as soon as you repeat
yourself in a more interesting way.

04:31.404 --> 04:32.496
Hey, Ben.

04:32.639 --> 04:33.765
Hey, what's up?

04:33.873 --> 04:35.704
Nothing much. Since I'm here,
I just wanted to let you know

04:35.775 --> 04:37.299
that Marlene
Griggs-Knope is my mom.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.908
(STAMMERS) What? Why...

04:39.979 --> 04:42.072
Also, she can be
cruel and difficult,

04:42.148 --> 04:43.672
and she makes snap
judgments about people

04:43.816 --> 04:45.340
that she holds on to
for a very long time.

04:45.418 --> 04:46.476
And she's kind of a bully.

04:46.552 --> 04:48.179
Okay! Go in there,
you're gonna be great.

04:48.254 --> 04:51.189
God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
I'm sorry. Here. Sorry!

04:52.225 --> 04:53.419
Hello.

04:53.493 --> 04:54.790
I'm Mr. Ben Wyatt.

04:55.261 --> 04:56.990
Looks like you got
some shirt on your coffee.

04:57.063 --> 04:58.860
Yeah. You know
what happened?

04:58.931 --> 05:02.162
I spilled it,
but you know how it goes.

05:03.069 --> 05:04.127
Fun anecdote.

05:04.570 --> 05:07.437
The county school district
needs four new school buses.

05:07.507 --> 05:09.407
I'm being stonewalled
by the board,

05:09.542 --> 05:11.476
and I'm hoping your office
can help us out.

05:11.544 --> 05:12.806
Okay.

05:13.579 --> 05:15.171
Really? That's it?

05:15.248 --> 05:18.308
Yeah. Actually, no. It...

05:18.985 --> 05:20.543
It's probably not possible.

05:20.720 --> 05:22.119
Then I'm confused, Ben,

05:22.588 --> 05:24.180
because you just
told me it was.

05:24.257 --> 05:25.417
Five seconds ago.

05:26.592 --> 05:29.425
I got a second box of donuts,
if anybody...

05:30.563 --> 05:31.996
What the (BLEEP) is this?

05:32.065 --> 05:34.966
This, Mr. Director,
is your new desk.

05:35.268 --> 05:36.326
Okay.

05:36.402 --> 05:37.994
This desk is the epitome

05:38.071 --> 05:40.665
of the Swedish
concept of <i>jämställdhet,</i>

05:40.740 --> 05:42.367
or "equality."

05:42.442 --> 05:43.773
Imagine someone
needs your attention.

05:43.843 --> 05:44.867
Somebody say my name.

05:44.944 --> 05:45.968
JERRY: Chris.

05:46.379 --> 05:48.438
Swivel! What is it, Jerry?

05:48.514 --> 05:50.004
You told me
to say your name.

05:50.083 --> 05:51.573
And you did
a great job, superstar.

05:52.051 --> 05:53.211
Someone else
say something.

05:53.286 --> 05:54.310
You look like a freak.

05:54.387 --> 05:55.854
Swivel!

05:55.922 --> 05:57.753
April, that is not
a very good attitude.

05:57.824 --> 05:59.621
I will keep my eye on you

05:59.692 --> 06:01.626
from my circular desk
where I can see everything.

06:01.694 --> 06:04.094
Tiny swivel.
See how it works?

06:04.530 --> 06:08.057
What about my office
and its many walls?

06:08.167 --> 06:10.601
That becomes a new
public waiting room.

06:10.670 --> 06:12.467
And we got rid of
that giant pillar

06:12.605 --> 06:14.436
that was in front
of your door.

06:14.507 --> 06:15.735
I loved that pillar.

06:15.808 --> 06:17.833
It made it really annoying
to stand in my doorway.

06:18.010 --> 06:20.240
(LAUGHS) Well, get over it,
because it's gone.

06:20.646 --> 06:23.479
You're gonna be more
accessible than ever.

06:27.653 --> 06:29.917
TOM: <i>The fourth floor.</i>
<i>Small claims court,</i>

06:29.989 --> 06:32.355
<i>divorce filings,</i>
<i>state-ordered drug tests.</i>

06:32.725 --> 06:35.125
It's somehow both
freezing and humid.

06:35.194 --> 06:37.025
There's a whole room
on the fourth floor

06:37.163 --> 06:39.097
where they store the knives
they've confiscated from people

06:39.165 --> 06:41.292
who went to the fourth floor
to stab someone.

06:41.534 --> 06:43.001
(METAL DETECTOR BEEPING)

06:43.202 --> 06:45.102
You from Parks and Rec?
Yeah.

06:45.171 --> 06:47.162
I'm here to
show you around.

06:47.540 --> 06:49.371
Nice to meet you, ma'am.
What's your name?

06:49.442 --> 06:52.411
Ethel Beavers.
Follow me.

06:53.346 --> 06:55.576
Okay, this is you.

06:56.215 --> 06:57.477
Oh, wow!

06:57.784 --> 06:59.911
Double computers?

07:00.386 --> 07:01.944
I get my own
office phone.

07:02.021 --> 07:03.249
Hello, Wall Street.

07:03.322 --> 07:05.483
Buy more stocks. Now.

07:05.558 --> 07:06.889
This phone kind of
smells like a butt.

07:06.959 --> 07:08.586
Try not to move
things around.

07:08.661 --> 07:12.028
Because technically speaking,
this is still a crime scene.

07:12.098 --> 07:13.690
Here's your name tags.

07:14.500 --> 07:15.592
Here.

07:16.402 --> 07:17.994
Ethel, this shirt is
from Theory.

07:18.070 --> 07:20.004
Name tags make holes.
I'm not wearing this.

07:20.139 --> 07:21.629
Do what you want.

07:23.242 --> 07:25.005
Bye, Ethel!
Damn it.

07:25.311 --> 07:28.075
Remind me next time to ask her
where she was when Lincoln got shot.

07:28.147 --> 07:31.742
"Remind...
Tom... Ask... Something."

07:32.118 --> 07:33.312
You got it, boss.

07:33.653 --> 07:35.985
Hey! Somebody made
somebody a mix!

07:36.055 --> 07:37.852
And I definitely heard your
feedback from last time,

07:37.924 --> 07:40.916
so I only put five Sarah
McLachlan songs on this one.

07:40.993 --> 07:43.757
Cool. Should we talk about
how you claimed your mom

07:43.830 --> 07:45.730
was a Filipino woman
you'd never met?

07:45.798 --> 07:46.890
Should we?

07:47.533 --> 07:48.557
(SIGHS)

07:48.634 --> 07:50.659
I was just trying to
delay the inevitable.

07:50.937 --> 07:53.132
If this turns
into something real,

07:53.206 --> 07:55.538
then we are gonna have
to deal with Chris <i>'</i> rule,

07:55.641 --> 07:58.667
and parents,
and annoying flossing habits,

07:58.744 --> 08:00.371
and a lot of un-fun stuff.

08:00.446 --> 08:02.141
But not yet.

08:02.215 --> 08:04.911
I just want to enjoy the
bubble for a little while.

08:06.185 --> 08:07.209
I'm sorry.

08:07.787 --> 08:09.652
Everything's good?
No, it's not.

08:09.722 --> 08:12.657
I was completely flustered.
I came off like an idiot.

08:12.925 --> 08:14.324
I mean, at one point,
for no reason,

08:14.393 --> 08:16.827
I just took off my shoes
and held them in my hand.

08:16.929 --> 08:20.092
I'm gonna go ask her how it went,
and I bet she loved you.

08:20.166 --> 08:21.155
(SIGHS)

08:21.267 --> 08:22.859
I loved him!

08:23.269 --> 08:26.295
He's a total pushover.

08:26.372 --> 08:28.431
Very odd guy, though.

08:28.508 --> 08:31.773
He's like a goofy,
spineless jellyfish.

08:32.111 --> 08:33.100
(CHUCKLES)

08:33.279 --> 08:34.746
Why do you ask,
sweetheart?

08:35.448 --> 08:36.745
No reason.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.315
Don't worry about it.
It's totally fine.

08:40.385 --> 08:41.648
No, it's not fine.

08:41.721 --> 08:44.383
What if she starts going around
telling people I'm a pushover?

08:44.457 --> 08:45.651
No one's gonna
believe that.

08:45.725 --> 08:48.592
When I first met you,
I thought you were a fascist hard-ass.

08:48.661 --> 08:50.686
What?
A cute fascist hard-ass,

08:50.763 --> 08:52.993
but still,
you give off a very...

08:54.000 --> 08:56.935
Education Department now officially
requesting 10 school buses.

08:57.737 --> 08:59.500
I thought they
only wanted four.

08:59.572 --> 09:02.769
Well, now that I'm a pushover,
why not ask for 10, or 20,

09:02.842 --> 09:05.811
or 100 new school buses
and a fleet of school yachts?

09:05.878 --> 09:07.971
How about that?
Here's what we're gonna do. (SIGHS)

09:08.548 --> 09:11.608
You are gonna tell me everything
there is to know about your mom.

09:11.684 --> 09:13.345
And I'm gonna have
another meeting with her,

09:13.419 --> 09:14.477
and we're gonna
have it out.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.579
Or we could go to Belize

09:16.656 --> 09:18.954
and go scuba diving.
And we could look at the whale sharks.

09:19.025 --> 09:20.890
You're certified, right?
Let's get you certified.

09:25.298 --> 09:27.994
April, do you have that usage
report that I asked for?

09:31.837 --> 09:33.031
Anything for you, Jerry.

09:33.172 --> 09:34.400
Thank you.

09:34.507 --> 09:36.907
Oh, come on. Why?

09:37.343 --> 09:39.277
Excuse me.

09:39.345 --> 09:42.974
There's a sign at Ramsett Park that says
" Do not drink the sprinkler water,"

09:43.082 --> 09:46.643
so I made sun tea with it,
and now I have an infection.

09:46.752 --> 09:48.219
Sir?

09:48.487 --> 09:51.615
Sir, are...
Are you listening to me, sir?

09:51.691 --> 09:54.159
Sir, I'm talking to you!

09:54.226 --> 09:55.557
Sir!

09:55.628 --> 09:57.653
Sir, are you aware

09:57.730 --> 10:01.928
that there is waste
in your water system?

10:02.001 --> 10:04.834
Okay, you need to be strong,
powerful, decisive.

10:04.904 --> 10:06.929
This is not a meeting.
It's a battle.

10:07.006 --> 10:08.974
Normal meeting rules
do not apply.

10:09.041 --> 10:11.874
I'll be my mom and I'm gonna
be very harsh with you,

10:11.978 --> 10:13.206
and it's only
because I like you a lot.

10:13.980 --> 10:15.140
Okay.
Go!

10:18.250 --> 10:19.342
Hello.
Wrong.

10:19.418 --> 10:21.409
What? No preambles.
No introductions.

10:21.487 --> 10:22.886
Just walk in
and start talking.

10:23.489 --> 10:25.423
I'd like to discuss
the new school bus.

10:25.491 --> 10:28.949
I'd like to discuss
your rhyming, Dr. Seuss.

10:29.261 --> 10:31.195
And you should be sitting by now.
What?

10:31.263 --> 10:32.389
Just walk in
and take a seat.

10:32.598 --> 10:35.533
Um...
"Um" is the sound in "dumb."

10:35.601 --> 10:36.761
That's what she
says to people.

10:36.836 --> 10:38.463
And now you've crossed
your legs like a woman.

10:38.537 --> 10:40.164
God!
Okay, should we just start over?

10:40.239 --> 10:42.002
No.
No, we need to put a pin in this.

10:42.074 --> 10:46.101
Here is a list of my mother's top
100 favorite conversation topics,

10:46.178 --> 10:48.476
starting with Persian rugs,
ending with Daniel Craig.

10:48.547 --> 10:50.742
You have 10 minutes
to memorize it.

10:50.983 --> 10:53.008
<i>Deliverance,</i> the movie?
Mmm-hmm.

10:53.085 --> 10:54.245
Oh, God.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.982
So Jerry is, like,
basically my boss now,

10:57.056 --> 10:58.785
which I'm never
gonna work for him.

10:58.858 --> 11:01.122
Ron's trapped in
this weird desk prison,

11:01.193 --> 11:04.390
and I now work at this
traveling IV station.

11:04.463 --> 11:06.226
This Mort Jansen's office?

11:06.432 --> 11:07.490
Nope.

11:09.235 --> 11:10.532
(SIGHS)

11:16.342 --> 11:18.537
Tell Mort I said
"Your move."

11:21.981 --> 11:23.915
Oh, my God.
I wanna work up here

11:23.983 --> 11:25.245
with you guys.
This is awesome.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.653
How many more of those stupid
documents do you have to scan?

11:27.787 --> 11:32.121
Just this one,
and all the ones in those boxes.

11:32.358 --> 11:34.053
TOM: <i>I gotta get out</i>
<i>of here pronto.</i>

11:34.126 --> 11:36.651
Time to get those old ladies
to do my work for me.

11:36.729 --> 11:40.165
How? By shining down on them
with the Haverford charm ray.

11:40.299 --> 11:41.630
(IMITATING RAY GUN)

11:42.868 --> 11:43.960
Well, well, well.

11:44.203 --> 11:45.966
If it isn't Ethel Beavers.

11:46.038 --> 11:47.903
What's up, beautiful?

11:47.973 --> 11:50.339
Julianne Moore just called.
She wants her hair back.

11:51.744 --> 11:54.440
Nobody named Julien called.

11:54.513 --> 11:57.311
Never mind. I just need to
ask you a couple of questions.

11:57.683 --> 12:00.777
One, can you help me out
with this project we're doing?

12:01.087 --> 12:02.384
And, two,

12:03.022 --> 12:05.957
will you please invite me
to your 30th birthday party?

12:08.794 --> 12:09.988
What are you doing?

12:10.062 --> 12:12.826
I'm making a test call to your
phone to make sure it's working

12:12.898 --> 12:15.059
so you don't miss
any more calls.

12:15.167 --> 12:16.395
You know what?
Don't bother.

12:16.469 --> 12:18.903
Maybe I'll just find an open
window and plummet to my death.

12:18.971 --> 12:20.336
Okay.

12:22.408 --> 12:24.273
This isn't gonna work.

12:25.611 --> 12:28.705
Okay, you did not just swivel
away while I was talking to you.

12:28.781 --> 12:32.649
This spaceship keyboard is
driving me crazy.

12:32.718 --> 12:36.017
I'm down to one word a minute,
and the word is "perflipisklup"

12:36.088 --> 12:38.420
because I can't
fly spaceships.

12:38.891 --> 12:40.552
Donna, you know
as well as I do

12:40.659 --> 12:43.150
these city manager shakeups
always peter out.

12:43.229 --> 12:44.389
You just have to wait.

12:44.530 --> 12:45.690
Usually I'm with you.

12:45.765 --> 12:48.461
But this is Chris Traeger,
the six million dollar man.

12:48.534 --> 12:49.626
He won't quit.

12:49.702 --> 12:51.863
So you need to swivel
your ass down to his office

12:51.937 --> 12:53.461
and have a word with him.

12:54.373 --> 12:55.897
Mommy.
Oh!

12:56.709 --> 13:00.543
That is so thoughtful
of you.

13:00.613 --> 13:01.978
Of course!

13:02.047 --> 13:06.313
I just figured, hey,
why not put my mother in a good mood?

13:06.685 --> 13:10.143
So, it's my understanding that
despite what I said in our meeting,

13:10.222 --> 13:13.658
you have somehow increased your
request for more school buses.

13:14.527 --> 13:16.757
Excuse me,
but I'm having coffee with my daughter.

13:16.829 --> 13:18.353
Maybe we could do
this another time.

13:18.430 --> 13:20.557
No, we're gonna
talk about this now.

13:21.500 --> 13:22.558
Or if you'd prefer,

13:22.635 --> 13:24.796
I could put a permanent freeze
on the education budget.

13:24.870 --> 13:26.462
It's your call.
(SCOFFS)

13:26.572 --> 13:30.804
Wow, maybe you should talk to him, Mom.
He seems pretty self-assured.

13:32.211 --> 13:33.508
There's nothing left.

13:33.879 --> 13:34.937
It's over.

13:35.014 --> 13:37.380
Hey, hey, hey, don't say that.
Now, come on.

13:38.484 --> 13:39.815
Get yourself together

13:39.919 --> 13:43.821
and go out there and be the woman
you always knew you could be.

13:44.356 --> 13:46.017
(SNIFFLES)
Thank you so much.

13:48.460 --> 13:49.449
Who was that?

13:49.595 --> 13:50.584
I don't know.

13:50.663 --> 13:53.097
I saw her crying,
and so I helped.

13:54.233 --> 13:55.530
What did you wanna
talk to me about?

13:55.601 --> 13:57.535
Look, Chris,
I'm very flattered

13:57.603 --> 13:59.696
you thought of me
for this amazing opportunity,

13:59.772 --> 14:02.832
but I don't really know if
this gig is in my wheelhouse.

14:02.908 --> 14:05.001
I tend to work best
with young, attractive people.

14:05.077 --> 14:07.739
Tom, I have made you
a project leader.

14:07.813 --> 14:09.007
This is a big deal!

14:09.081 --> 14:10.480
You should keep
an open mind.

14:10.549 --> 14:13.541
Let your brain unlock the door
to your heart's future.

14:13.953 --> 14:15.750
I made that expression up
when I was 14.

14:15.855 --> 14:18.722
Still in use today.
By me. Gotta jam.

14:20.159 --> 14:21.888
You know what?
It's just not possible.

14:21.961 --> 14:23.758
And don't even bother
trying to outflank me either,

14:23.829 --> 14:24.955
because you will fail.

14:25.264 --> 14:27.357
Where did all this confidence
come from all of a sudden?

14:27.433 --> 14:28.730
Hey, guys, come on.
Let's relax.

14:28.834 --> 14:30.802
You know, Ms. Griggs-Knope...
Marlene.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.394
There's probably
a compromise here.

14:32.471 --> 14:34.336
Compromise is usually
a sign of weakness.

14:34.406 --> 14:36.499
Yes, it is, according to
Andrew Carnegie.

14:36.842 --> 14:38.810
But your demands remind me
of a different quote,

14:38.878 --> 14:40.368
from the great
Bill Watterson.

14:41.146 --> 14:43.808
"You need a lobotomy.
I'll get a saw."

14:44.817 --> 14:47.308
I love <i>Calvin and Hobbes.</i>
Me, too!

14:49.521 --> 14:52.115
I gotta say,
this is some of my best work.

14:52.191 --> 14:54.216
This could not
have gone better.

14:54.293 --> 14:56.090
They are really
hitting it off.

14:56.195 --> 14:58.561
Thank God. Crisis averted.

15:01.100 --> 15:03.830
Well, I am very glad
you came back up here.

15:05.471 --> 15:06.563
Yeah, me too.

15:06.639 --> 15:08.231
Yeah...
So you have a deal.

15:08.340 --> 15:09.932
Well, let me
mull everything over,

15:10.009 --> 15:12.910
and then we can reconnect
and hash things out.

15:13.479 --> 15:16.209
It might get rough,
but that can be fun.

15:16.282 --> 15:18.147
Ben can handle it.
Yep, I can.

15:18.217 --> 15:19.684
Okay, great.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.913
It was a pleasure.
Oh! Mmm-hmm.

15:24.490 --> 15:25.980
What's so great is,
she was impressed by you, too.

15:26.058 --> 15:27.150
I mean, you could
tell instantly.

15:27.226 --> 15:29.126
The way you guys were
connecting was really amazing.

15:29.194 --> 15:30.286
Now, what I'm thinking
is that maybe

15:30.429 --> 15:31.521
we should go over
to her house...

15:32.164 --> 15:35.429
You two are just the
cutest things on four legs!

15:35.501 --> 15:37.264
But why so much black?

15:37.336 --> 15:38.860
It's like you're
going to a funeral.

15:39.071 --> 15:40.333
She's got a point, babe.

15:40.472 --> 15:41.769
So, marry her then.

15:42.007 --> 15:43.167
(LAUGHS) I wish!

15:43.742 --> 15:45.801
Hey, sorry to
interrupt the love fest,

15:45.878 --> 15:47.607
but can you hand me that
folder there, please, Ethel?

15:48.981 --> 15:50.005
TOM: Oh, great.

15:50.082 --> 15:51.447
Why you gotta be
like that, Ethel?

15:51.517 --> 15:54.179
Looks like someone got up
on the wrong side of the crib.

15:54.320 --> 15:55.412
(LAUGHING)

15:55.621 --> 15:56.849
Stop laughing, Muriel.

15:56.922 --> 15:57.911
(BOTH LAUGHING LOUDLY)

15:58.123 --> 15:59.488
Stop it!

16:00.125 --> 16:01.456
I gotta say,
I'm a genius.

16:01.527 --> 16:03.722
The only thing my mom loves
more than music boxes

16:03.796 --> 16:05.320
is McSteamy from
<i>Grey's Anatomy.</i>

16:05.397 --> 16:09.163
So, I made her
a McSteamy-style music box,

16:09.234 --> 16:11.794
and I thought maybe you could give
it to her. She would love you for it.

16:11.870 --> 16:13.997
I think maybe that's
not such a good idea.

16:14.106 --> 16:17.098
Why? I mean,
it's not the best picture of him, but...

16:17.443 --> 16:19.206
Your mom kind of,

16:21.280 --> 16:22.269
um,

16:23.048 --> 16:24.709
made a pass at me.

16:27.353 --> 16:29.446
JERRY: So,
Webster's dictionary

16:29.621 --> 16:31.589
describes a pork as a...

16:31.724 --> 16:33.624
No, it's park... Park.

16:34.159 --> 16:36.252
I'm sorry. Geez, okay. So...

16:37.229 --> 16:39.060
You know what,
can we start over?

16:39.131 --> 16:40.530
Let's... Let's go
from the first thing.

16:40.599 --> 16:42.863
I said, pork, which...
By the way,

16:42.935 --> 16:45.529
they have a great pork sandwich
in the cafeteria today.

16:45.771 --> 16:47.671
Ron Swanson.
Chris.

16:47.740 --> 16:52.302
You have come up with a plan
so spectacularly horrible

16:52.378 --> 16:54.369
that it might ruin
the entire department.

16:54.446 --> 16:56.812
Now, wait a minute.
I mean that as a compliment.

16:57.249 --> 16:58.682
So, it pains me
to say this.

16:59.351 --> 17:01.581
My department has to go back
to the way it was.

17:01.653 --> 17:03.143
Give them time.
They'll adjust.

17:03.222 --> 17:05.554
No, they won't.
They're miserable.

17:06.492 --> 17:09.119
Tom only performs when
there's someone to impress,

17:09.228 --> 17:12.560
so marooning him on Freak
Island isn't helping anyone.

17:12.631 --> 17:16.396
And you made April assistant to
everyone? You know who April hates?

17:17.469 --> 17:19.130
Everyone.

17:19.204 --> 17:21.934
And Jerry can only function
if no one's looking.

17:22.007 --> 17:23.133
You shine a light on him,

17:23.208 --> 17:25.904
and he shrinks up faster
than an Eskimo's scrotum.

17:26.011 --> 17:27.535
Well, that's
very perceptive, Ron.

17:27.613 --> 17:29.410
And, very graphic.

17:29.848 --> 17:30.906
I understand your point,

17:30.983 --> 17:33.451
but there's no way that I
can just roll over on this.

17:34.219 --> 17:35.311
(GROANS)

17:35.721 --> 17:37.780
Okay.

17:37.856 --> 17:40.984
You won't ever hear me say this again,
so savor this moment.

17:43.662 --> 17:45.823
I may have a compromise.

17:45.898 --> 17:47.889
Look, she was just
flirting a little.

17:47.966 --> 17:50.366
I'm sure she's not
really interested in me.

17:50.436 --> 17:52.495
Oh, my God.
I can't even have this conversation.

17:52.571 --> 17:53.902
The whole thing
is screwed up now.

17:54.506 --> 17:56.269
There's so many ways
to destroy a bubble,

17:56.341 --> 17:59.674
but my mom flirting with you
is number one on the list.

18:00.012 --> 18:01.912
And I'm sorry,
I have to say this,

18:02.014 --> 18:03.811
were you asking
for it in any way?

18:04.216 --> 18:05.274
No!

18:05.350 --> 18:06.817
How were you dressed?
Oh, my God.

18:06.885 --> 18:08.614
I was wearing this.
Here's what we do.

18:08.687 --> 18:10.450
You issue
a government-wide memo

18:10.522 --> 18:12.387
about sexual harassment,
and then you go to Mexico.

18:12.825 --> 18:14.656
Just for
a couple of weeks.

18:14.793 --> 18:16.784
Where are you going? Ben!

18:17.262 --> 18:18.991
Ben! Wait. Just... Hey...

18:20.299 --> 18:21.391
Hi, Mom.

18:21.467 --> 18:23.435
Hi again.
Leslie and I are dating.

18:24.136 --> 18:25.160
We haven't told anyone

18:25.237 --> 18:27.603
because there's a rule
against office relationships.

18:27.673 --> 18:29.197
But it's happening.

18:29.274 --> 18:31.674
I'm sorry we didn't tell you
before you touched my knee,

18:31.743 --> 18:33.472
and I trust you
won't tell anyone now

18:33.612 --> 18:35.341
since it could get
your daughter fired.

18:42.521 --> 18:44.785
That is hilarious.

18:45.524 --> 18:47.389
That's what
we thought, too.

18:48.160 --> 18:49.354
Well...

18:49.995 --> 18:51.087
(SIGHS)

18:51.563 --> 18:52.587
Four buses.

18:52.798 --> 18:54.231
Two.
Deal.

18:59.738 --> 19:01.069
I like this one.

19:01.707 --> 19:02.901
Me, too.

19:03.375 --> 19:05.502
You keep your hands off him.

19:06.411 --> 19:08.811
Margaret's pecan squares.

19:09.414 --> 19:11.644
They are like crack.
I brought you one.

19:11.750 --> 19:13.183
How are you so
happy working here?

19:13.352 --> 19:15.877
I don't know, man. It's not that bad.
A year ago, I lived in a pit.

19:15.954 --> 19:18.889
Now I got a job,
and a kickass wife.

19:18.957 --> 19:21.221
And my band is so good,

19:21.293 --> 19:23.557
and are you gonna eat
that pecan square?

19:27.866 --> 19:31.893
When life gives you lemons,
make lemonade.

19:32.404 --> 19:34.872
I read that once on
a can of lemonade.

19:34.940 --> 19:37.135
But I like to think
that it applies to life.

19:38.443 --> 19:39.933
I don't want lemonade.

19:40.112 --> 19:42.512
It's too sweet and it makes
my tongue feel gritty.

19:42.614 --> 19:44.343
<i>So maybe it's</i>
<i>time for a change.</i>

19:44.650 --> 19:46.880
<i>Starting now,</i>
<i>when life gives me lemons,</i>

19:47.085 --> 19:48.814
<i>I'm gonna slice</i>
<i>them up into wedges</i>

19:49.087 --> 19:51.021
<i>and throw them</i>
<i>into vodka tonics,</i>

19:51.089 --> 19:53.887
which I will then sip
in a burlesque nightclub

19:53.959 --> 19:58.328
that I co-own with actor Taye Diggs
and two of the Pussycat Dolls.

20:01.333 --> 20:02.493
Here you go.

20:02.568 --> 20:04.035
Thank you.

20:09.575 --> 20:11.543
Kind of figured you'd be
back in your office by now.

20:11.810 --> 20:14.108
Well, you know how
new city managers are.

20:14.680 --> 20:16.807
Seems like everyone
else is back to normal.

20:18.283 --> 20:20.308
How long do you have to do this?
A week.

20:22.054 --> 20:24.648
Citizen request.
Swivel, swivel, swivel.

20:24.723 --> 20:27.487
Hello. I can
help you in here, sir.

20:32.965 --> 20:35.456
Oh, man, you're really
screwing this up.

20:35.867 --> 20:39.359
I'm gone for one day and this
entire shoe shine stand falls apart.

20:39.438 --> 20:40.769
Everything I built.

20:41.173 --> 20:42.401
Jump up here.
I'll show you how it's done.

20:43.308 --> 20:44.900
See, your problem is
you're thinking too much.

20:46.511 --> 20:48.570
Wow. You're
really good at this.

20:48.647 --> 20:50.080
Yes. I am.

20:50.148 --> 20:51.376
When I come back
here in a few weeks,

20:51.450 --> 20:53.918
I don't want all my regular customers
to not be here waiting for me

20:53.986 --> 20:55.715
because somebody
screwed it up.

20:56.722 --> 20:57.711
Huh?

20:57.823 --> 20:58.847
Thanks.

20:58.991 --> 21:00.015
No problem.

21:00.492 --> 21:01.857
See you later, kid.
Wow.

21:01.927 --> 21:03.861
What a moron.

21:04.305 --> 21:10.575
