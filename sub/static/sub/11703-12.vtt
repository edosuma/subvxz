WEBVTT

00:04.283 --> 00:06.255
There you go, Dor.

00:11.385 --> 00:14.106
Franky. She's coming in tomorrow.

00:14.231 --> 00:16.317
The wife of the cyclist I...

00:16.711 --> 00:19.653
Yeah, I'm gonna be up to my
neck in meal prep. Sorry, kiddo.

00:19.876 --> 00:21.655
Will you come with me?

00:23.324 --> 00:25.538
Oh, course I will, love.

00:26.960 --> 00:28.495
Congratulations.

00:28.620 --> 00:30.539
I heard that you got your parole approved.

00:30.835 --> 00:32.500
You ever had a premonition, Liz?

00:32.899 --> 00:36.073
- I'm never getting out of here alive.
- I fucked up, Bea.

00:36.133 --> 00:39.340
The police have me on CCTV
getting rid of the splitter head.

00:39.359 --> 00:41.064
If they find that, they're gonna arrest me.

00:42.180 --> 00:44.575
The man who attacked me is the
guy who tried to kill Fletch.

00:44.601 --> 00:46.459
In here is his DNA.

00:46.584 --> 00:47.639
His name, Bea.

00:47.834 --> 00:49.459
I need to know his name.

00:49.808 --> 00:51.982
I need you to find out who he is.

00:52.167 --> 00:53.192
I'll find the bastard.

00:53.456 --> 00:54.939
And when I do...

00:55.064 --> 00:58.015
I suspect that you're right
about Governor Ferguson.

00:58.140 --> 00:59.618
If I find proof,

00:59.743 --> 01:01.283
and I go to the Board with it,

01:01.453 --> 01:03.890
- will you support me?
- Absolutely.

01:03.989 --> 01:06.457
I know you were behind what
happened to Jodie Spiteri.

01:06.489 --> 01:09.368
I am equally certain
everything Bea Smith claimed

01:09.379 --> 01:10.760
about being attacked is true.

01:10.796 --> 01:12.441
You are not fit to be Governor.

01:13.251 --> 01:16.152
Why could I never be good enough for you?

01:18.076 --> 01:19.194
You're insane.

01:20.031 --> 01:21.757
And I know what you've done.

01:22.530 --> 01:24.468
Take care of Mr Fletcher.

01:24.765 --> 01:26.888
And this time, finish the job.

02:14.719 --> 02:16.281
They call me a freak.

02:19.848 --> 02:21.376
An aberration.

02:23.879 --> 02:25.299
An anomaly.

02:27.510 --> 02:28.900
A monster.

02:31.666 --> 02:34.643
They fear me because I make
the difficult decisions.

02:35.968 --> 02:38.700
The decisions nobody else
has the courage to make.

02:41.990 --> 02:44.130
They're right to be afraid.

02:50.754 --> 02:53.403
I will remove any

02:53.416 --> 02:56.071
and all obstacles in my path...

03:00.621 --> 03:02.095
... for the greater good.

03:04.928 --> 03:07.048
You need to have faith in me.

03:09.423 --> 03:11.079
I know what's best.

03:26.642 --> 03:27.714
Who is it?

03:28.033 --> 03:29.413
Fletch, it's me.

03:34.409 --> 03:35.247
Come in.

03:35.983 --> 03:37.820
Why are you ignoring my calls?

03:37.940 --> 03:39.271
I didn't feel like talking.

03:40.304 --> 03:41.331
Well,

03:41.452 --> 03:43.255
I have to give you some news.

03:43.920 --> 03:46.555
You're on permanent stress
leave, effective immediately.

03:46.732 --> 03:48.154
Governor's orders, I bet.

03:48.918 --> 03:49.721
I'm sorry.

03:50.202 --> 03:51.558
You'll be next, Vera.

03:51.884 --> 03:53.061
It won't end with the demotion.

03:53.095 --> 03:54.575
She wants you gone. She wants us all gone.

03:54.587 --> 03:57.581
And she's fuckin' crazy. I just
saw her talking to thin air.

03:58.247 --> 03:59.360
If we don't make a move soon,

03:59.373 --> 04:01.462
it'll be too late, and
we need to get her out.

04:02.568 --> 04:03.989
I've remembered, Vera,

04:04.109 --> 04:06.127
and if you're in I'll
tell you everything I know.

04:11.962 --> 04:13.485
Count's in five, ladies.

04:13.911 --> 04:15.373
Conway, get back to your own unit.

04:15.494 --> 04:17.586
Oh, can't she have a sleepover, Miss?

04:17.595 --> 04:19.339
Enough, Smith. You've got
a visitor in the morning.

04:19.351 --> 04:20.363
Karen Proctor.

04:20.677 --> 04:21.822
- Thanks.
- Come on.

04:22.186 --> 04:23.472
Fingers crossed.

04:23.961 --> 04:25.509
Yeah, here's hoping.

04:28.457 --> 04:29.500
Hey Booms?

04:30.207 --> 04:32.032
- What?
- Get out here.

04:34.674 --> 04:36.023
I'm divvying up my stuff.

04:36.694 --> 04:38.143
That box is for you.

04:38.850 --> 04:39.777
Don't want it.

04:40.060 --> 04:41.292
You don't know what's in it.

04:41.626 --> 04:42.553
I don't care.

04:42.594 --> 04:44.961
In a few days' time I'll be gone and
then you never have to see me again.

04:44.986 --> 04:45.822
Good.

04:50.684 --> 04:52.592
I'm just going to leave it out here.

04:53.947 --> 04:56.023
If you don't want it, someone else will.

04:58.396 --> 04:59.858
Don't even think about it.

05:02.002 --> 05:04.962
If anyone gets in Ferguson's
way, she takes them out.

05:05.262 --> 05:07.643
Me, Will, Bea, Jodie and now you.

05:07.689 --> 05:10.198
But between us, we've got more
than enough to bring her down.

05:14.831 --> 05:16.900
I should just go straight
to the Board with this.

05:16.910 --> 05:18.726
Do it. I mean, they can't ignore you.

05:18.981 --> 05:21.071
They're obligated to investigate.

05:24.188 --> 05:26.186
I will call them, first thing.

05:27.425 --> 05:28.872
Vera.

05:30.401 --> 05:32.319
Is everything...

05:32.809 --> 05:34.553
you know, OK with the, um,

05:34.829 --> 05:37.677
-  you know, with the...
- Yeah. Oh, yep, it's fine.

05:37.877 --> 05:39.688
If there's anything I can do to help...

05:48.921 --> 05:51.254
You warned me a long
time ago about Ferguson.

05:52.997 --> 05:54.623
I'm sorry I didn't listen.

05:57.193 --> 05:58.743
We all make mistakes.

06:01.006 --> 06:02.647
Yep, I've made plenty.

06:05.248 --> 06:07.109
I've done things I'm not proud of.

06:10.648 --> 06:12.668
And I hope that...

06:14.110 --> 06:16.034
I hope this makes up for some of it.

06:42.376 --> 06:43.665
How is he?

06:44.255 --> 06:46.053
Bet he's missing his mum.

06:46.245 --> 06:48.948
- Can I've a hold?
- Fuck off, Liz.

06:49.209 --> 06:50.414
Charming.

06:54.062 --> 06:55.381
Alright ladies.

06:55.962 --> 06:58.178
- I'm going to take Joshua now.
- But he's sleeping.

06:58.215 --> 07:00.374
- He's due for another feed.
- But I want to keep him.

07:00.401 --> 07:01.971
Jess, not a request.

07:04.701 --> 07:07.219
- OK, thanks.
- How's Doreen? Is she OK?

07:07.399 --> 07:09.876
Yeah, I think a good
night's sleep has helped.

07:10.847 --> 07:12.196
I'll bring him back soon.

07:12.931 --> 07:16.359
I'm just off to see Soph, then I'll
pop in and see Dor, if that's OK.

07:16.633 --> 07:18.976
- Sure. I'll let her know.
- Cheers.

07:27.234 --> 07:28.502
Hi, Sophie.

07:29.041 --> 07:32.340
I'm Jane Eason, the
court-appointed social worker.

07:32.799 --> 07:34.898
I see you've brought
someone to support you today.

07:34.911 --> 07:36.867
Oh, yeah, this is my um,

07:37.547 --> 07:38.410
Liz.

07:38.702 --> 07:40.033
- Hi Liz.
- Hi.

07:40.218 --> 07:41.265
Come and sit down.

07:42.053 --> 07:42.879
You're right.

07:50.013 --> 07:52.168
This is Christine Connors.

07:53.593 --> 07:57.888
As the Judge explained, this is part
of the Restorative Justice Program

07:57.903 --> 07:59.775
to allow victims of crime

07:59.846 --> 08:01.709
a chance to meet the offender.

08:03.422 --> 08:05.835
Now it's not about confrontation.

08:06.403 --> 08:08.319
It's about fostering dialogue.

08:09.271 --> 08:13.485
But offenders are encouraged to take
responsibility for their actions.

08:14.608 --> 08:16.896
Christine, would you like to start?

08:19.683 --> 08:21.988
You're so young.

08:23.940 --> 08:27.346
I had this picture in my
mind of what you'd be like

08:27.685 --> 08:30.382
and then I saw you in
court a few weeks' back.

08:32.740 --> 08:34.750
And you were nothing

08:35.852 --> 08:39.592
like the murderer I imagined.

08:41.260 --> 08:44.288
I almost felt sorry for you.

08:47.449 --> 08:50.072
But then I reminded myself

08:50.963 --> 08:53.320
that this wasn't the
first time you got drunk

08:53.345 --> 08:54.725
and drove a car.

08:55.299 --> 08:57.121
Only this time...

09:04.253 --> 09:06.181
... my little boy's father

09:06.302 --> 09:08.374
paid with his life.

09:18.783 --> 09:19.958
I'm sorry.

09:20.840 --> 09:22.932
I can't forgive myself.

09:29.566 --> 09:30.800
Christine.

09:31.778 --> 09:33.324
I'm Sophie's mum.

09:33.855 --> 09:37.040
Um, I don't want to speak for Soph,

09:37.063 --> 09:38.479
but it might help a little bit

09:38.489 --> 09:40.341
if I explain a few things to you.

09:40.878 --> 09:41.954
If that's alright.

09:44.851 --> 09:46.936
I'm an alcoholic and I have been for years

09:46.950 --> 09:49.562
and when Soph was a
little girl I did something

09:49.683 --> 09:52.375
selfish and stupid that landed me in here.

09:52.404 --> 09:53.280
Mum...

09:53.506 --> 09:55.697
And I know the seeds of
what happened the night

09:55.708 --> 09:57.569
your husband lost his life...

09:57.689 --> 09:58.556
Mum.

10:07.670 --> 10:08.886
Mrs Connors,

10:10.268 --> 10:11.356
I'm sorry.

10:12.978 --> 10:15.678
Now I know that's not good enough but...

10:16.886 --> 10:17.960
but I am.

10:20.325 --> 10:23.168
What I've done to you and your family is

10:24.342 --> 10:25.922
unforgiveable.

10:26.808 --> 10:29.529
But it's not my mum's fault.

10:30.547 --> 10:32.734
No matter what happened when I was a kid,

10:33.911 --> 10:35.323
I'm an adult now.

10:38.263 --> 10:40.026
I killed your husband,

10:40.637 --> 10:41.784
no-one else.

10:46.574 --> 10:47.930
And I'm sorry.

10:49.465 --> 10:50.831
I'm really sorry.

10:59.874 --> 11:02.925
I noticed Kaz Proctor on
Smith's visitor's list.

11:02.957 --> 11:04.321
Make sure it's a secure visit.

11:04.443 --> 11:05.396
Box number one.

11:05.659 --> 11:06.527
Yes, Governor.

11:21.833 --> 11:22.601
Governor?

11:24.381 --> 11:25.644
Everything OK?

11:27.378 --> 11:28.675
Get on with your work.

11:32.920 --> 11:33.790
Jenkins.

11:34.188 --> 11:34.864
What?

11:35.268 --> 11:37.771
Your appeal's been granted.
The hearing's in two weeks.

11:38.016 --> 11:38.974
What appeal?

11:39.459 --> 11:40.745
Against the sentence.

11:41.105 --> 11:42.318
The drug charges.

11:42.749 --> 11:44.347
Just read the letter, Boomer.

11:59.788 --> 12:01.672
- There you go.
- Thank you.

12:05.367 --> 12:06.953
I'm so proud of you, Soph.

12:07.074 --> 12:07.859
Yeah,

12:07.979 --> 12:09.725
you've got nothing to be proud of.

12:10.653 --> 12:11.598
I've been a real shit.

12:11.621 --> 12:14.763
Oh, love, it's been tough on
both of us having you in here.

12:15.397 --> 12:17.904
We're trying to figure out
where we stand with each other.

12:19.040 --> 12:20.875
I think we're a work in progress, love.

12:23.341 --> 12:24.273
Hey!

12:25.873 --> 12:26.766
Hey.

12:29.193 --> 12:30.139
How'd it go?

12:30.445 --> 12:31.824
I thought you had meal prep.

12:33.206 --> 12:34.447
Yeah, I'm just in there now.

12:38.743 --> 12:39.599
I'm gonna go.

12:50.370 --> 12:51.321
Yeah?

12:58.784 --> 12:59.636
Was it you?

13:00.831 --> 13:01.851
I'm not following.

13:04.263 --> 13:05.220
Oh, that?

13:05.848 --> 13:06.629
Yeah.

13:07.317 --> 13:10.370
I found a precedent that'll knock
a few years off your sentence.

13:11.824 --> 13:13.696
Details are in that box that I left ya.

13:17.811 --> 13:19.052
Oh. I dunno what to say.

13:26.464 --> 13:28.375
Oh, don't do that.

13:29.535 --> 13:31.187
Come on.

13:31.769 --> 13:32.534
Hey!

13:33.209 --> 13:35.651
You deserve to get out of here one day.

13:36.049 --> 13:37.681
You're way better than this place.

13:41.163 --> 13:43.097
Sometimes I don't know if I am.

13:43.703 --> 13:44.687
Well you are.

13:45.765 --> 13:47.894
I hated fighting with you.

13:47.929 --> 13:51.292
Oh, you're such a big sook, aren't ya?

13:51.320 --> 13:52.314
Yeah.

13:52.367 --> 13:54.409
- Sorry.
- You got nothing to be sorry about.

13:59.359 --> 14:02.963
Hey, I'm... I'm happy for
you. You're getting out.

14:02.982 --> 14:04.072
It's just I'm...

14:04.807 --> 14:07.024
I'm gonna miss you, though.

14:11.316 --> 14:12.448
Gonna miss you a lot.

14:17.165 --> 14:18.819
I love ya, ya doofus.

14:21.658 --> 14:22.379
Yeah?

14:24.221 --> 14:25.649
- Only don't tell anyone.
- No.

14:27.320 --> 14:29.248
I love you too.

14:31.036 --> 14:32.027
OK.

14:32.659 --> 14:33.972
- Booms.
- Mm.

14:35.110 --> 14:37.110
- You need to let go now.
- No.

14:38.097 --> 14:39.760
No seriously, you need to let go.

14:39.782 --> 14:40.664
No.

14:41.006 --> 14:41.896
Boomer!

14:43.787 --> 14:44.738
Jess.

14:50.861 --> 14:51.770
Hi, Dor.

14:51.925 --> 14:52.727
Oh, hey.

14:53.102 --> 14:53.865
Come in.

14:56.223 --> 14:57.438
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

14:57.461 --> 14:58.954
Thanks for looking after him last night.

14:59.170 --> 15:00.194
Oh, no trouble.

15:00.367 --> 15:01.946
I can do it again tonight if you'd like.

15:04.325 --> 15:05.611
How long are they keeping you here?

15:05.731 --> 15:08.088
Oh, they've just got to run
a few more tests and stuff and

15:08.209 --> 15:09.979
want me to speak to a
shrink for some reason.

15:10.056 --> 15:10.715
Yeah.

15:13.741 --> 15:15.535
There's something I wanted
to talk to you about.

15:15.924 --> 15:16.786
Sure.

15:17.749 --> 15:20.573
Look, you've been a
great help and everythin',

15:22.450 --> 15:24.929
but I've decided to
make Liz alternate carer.

15:26.190 --> 15:27.878
Like I've said before, she's like my mum.

15:27.891 --> 15:29.708
And I do trust you, I do.

15:30.259 --> 15:33.653
- It's just that she's had more experience...
- Liz is dangerous.

15:34.354 --> 15:36.664
You can't give our
beautiful baby to a drunk.

15:37.477 --> 15:39.658
He's my baby, Jess.

15:40.826 --> 15:43.430
Look, I know Liz hasn't
been herself lately, but

15:43.708 --> 15:46.262
I reckon this will help her as well as me.

15:47.718 --> 15:50.142
You're still going to
see him, all the time.

15:50.153 --> 15:51.360
Nothing's gonna change.

15:51.393 --> 15:54.038
- You're not thinking straight.
- I've made up my mind.

16:01.576 --> 16:02.378
Jess.

16:04.904 --> 16:06.316
I hope you understand.

16:09.070 --> 16:10.100
I understand.

16:17.142 --> 16:17.904
Hey.

16:22.204 --> 16:23.510
Have you got a name for me?

16:28.692 --> 16:29.504
Kaz?

16:31.334 --> 16:33.158
- Well?
- Yeah, I got it.

16:36.229 --> 16:37.153
Nils Jesper.

16:37.828 --> 16:38.665
Ex-crim.

16:38.785 --> 16:41.367
Did 5 years for armed robbery,
8 years for manslaughter.

16:41.377 --> 16:43.503
He got out in '98 and
just dropped off the radar.

16:46.143 --> 16:47.567
And you're sure this is the guy?

16:48.010 --> 16:50.366
'Cause I've got one chance.
There's no room for mistakes.

16:50.400 --> 16:50.763
Bea,

16:51.084 --> 16:52.623
Red Right Hand don't get it wrong.

16:53.051 --> 16:55.346
We did a cross-match on
the Vic Police database.

16:55.662 --> 16:56.598
It's him.

16:56.720 --> 17:00.179
- Nils Jasper.
- N-i-l-s.

17:01.648 --> 17:02.703
Yeah, I gotta go.

17:03.123 --> 17:05.580
What level of retribution are we
talking about? We need to know.

17:06.105 --> 17:08.093
No, you don't need to
know. I got it covered.

17:08.123 --> 17:10.236
You said he was ours
after the last meeting.

17:10.451 --> 17:12.840
- Ms Miles!
- What the fuck are you doing?

17:13.184 --> 17:15.227
Don't you turn your fucking back on me!

17:15.237 --> 17:17.482
Look, I don't give a shit about
you and the Red Right Hand, OK?

17:17.493 --> 17:18.208
You fuck!

17:19.148 --> 17:20.608
I need to see Mr Jackson.

17:20.634 --> 17:22.055
Fucking user!

17:22.175 --> 17:23.627
You fuck!

17:34.858 --> 17:35.742
Mr Jackson.

17:36.640 --> 17:38.151
These gentlemen wish to speak with you.

17:38.472 --> 17:41.110
William Jackson, you're under
arrest for the murder of Harry Smith.

17:41.516 --> 17:43.037
- You're not obliged to say anything...
- Mr Jackson!

17:43.054 --> 17:44.899
- But anything you say or do...
- Get her back to her unit.

17:44.909 --> 17:46.656
Mr Jackson, I need to talk to you now!

17:46.701 --> 17:48.485
- Do you understand?
- Get your hands off me.

17:48.522 --> 17:49.699
- Yes.
- Mr Jackson!

17:50.360 --> 17:51.435
Righto, let's go.

19:29.731 --> 19:31.768
Nils Jesper. Ex-crim.

19:31.890 --> 19:34.463
Did five years for armed
robbery, eight for manslaughter.

19:34.479 --> 19:36.585
He got out in '98 and
just dropped off the radar.

19:36.938 --> 19:38.505
You're sure this is the guy?

19:38.626 --> 19:39.694
Because I got one chance.

19:39.736 --> 19:41.630
- There's no room for mistakes.
- Bea,

19:41.750 --> 19:43.288
Red Right Hand don't get it wrong.

19:43.583 --> 19:45.918
We did a cross-match on
the Vic Police database.

19:46.197 --> 19:47.956
- It's him.
- Pick up pick up pick up.

19:53.331 --> 19:54.964
- Yep.
- It's me.

19:55.001 --> 19:56.874
They're onto you. Do it now and get out.

19:57.642 --> 19:59.873
I don't give a shit about you
and the Red Right Hand, OK?

19:59.894 --> 20:00.851
Fuck!

20:01.109 --> 20:02.483
I need to see Mr Jackson.

20:02.530 --> 20:04.102
Fucking user!

20:04.147 --> 20:05.450
You fuck!

20:14.815 --> 20:15.469
Hey!

20:16.960 --> 20:18.135
So who's got the phone?

20:19.048 --> 20:20.698
I haven't got time to mess
around, so who's got it?

20:20.711 --> 20:21.552
No-one.

20:22.909 --> 20:23.986
Let's take a walk.

20:25.555 --> 20:26.897
I'm not gonna get angry.

20:26.977 --> 20:28.946
I just want to use it and
then maybe you'll get it back.

20:29.607 --> 20:32.095
- Bea, there isn't one.
- Bullshit.

20:32.215 --> 20:34.024
I know someone's got a phone, so who is it?

20:36.214 --> 20:37.928
You're gonna get me that phone

20:37.976 --> 20:40.169
- or you won't speak right for a month.
- Bea.

20:40.179 --> 20:41.351
Attention compound.

20:41.472 --> 20:43.955
- Exercise period is now over.
- You guys got somewhere to be?

20:43.973 --> 20:45.453
All prisoners return to your units.

20:49.863 --> 20:50.703
Take a seat.

20:53.212 --> 20:54.978
- What's this?
- Evidence.

20:54.997 --> 20:57.620
That DNA will match the sample
you found on Harry's body.

20:57.742 --> 20:59.748
- Take a seat, Mr Jackson.
- I'm serious.

20:59.762 --> 21:01.293
- Test the sample.
- Yeah, sure.

21:01.321 --> 21:03.727
I'll just run it through my
portable lab kit, shall I? Sit down.

21:04.169 --> 21:07.601
That man came into prison,
attacked one of the prisoners.

21:07.619 --> 21:09.720
- He's connected to Ferguson.
- The Governor?

21:10.356 --> 21:12.031
- Test the sample.
- It'll match.

21:13.227 --> 21:14.528
How exactly did you get hold of this?

21:14.578 --> 21:16.530
- The prisoner that was attacked.
- Whose name is?

21:16.549 --> 21:18.515
-  Does it matter?
- Well can I hazard a guess?

21:18.524 --> 21:19.392
Bea Smith?

21:21.568 --> 21:23.946
That guy is dangerous.
I think he's the killer.

21:25.222 --> 21:27.990
I know you can't use it in court,
but at least it'll prove he was there.

21:28.031 --> 21:29.458
How do I know he wasn't your accomplice?

21:29.482 --> 21:31.807
- Just find him!
- You can't even give me a name!

21:34.229 --> 21:34.909
Yeah?

21:35.564 --> 21:38.178
Sir, Mr Jackson's lawyer on line 2.

21:39.056 --> 21:40.264
He doesn't muck around.

21:40.527 --> 21:41.960
Ah, 'she'.

21:45.716 --> 21:46.470
Hello?

21:46.646 --> 21:47.902
Mr Jackson?

21:48.637 --> 21:50.962
His name is Jesper.

21:51.332 --> 21:53.405
Nils Jesper.

22:17.926 --> 22:18.604
Hello?

22:18.806 --> 22:19.779
Vera.

22:20.497 --> 22:21.828
Did you meet with the Board?

22:24.324 --> 22:25.375
What'd they say?

22:26.091 --> 22:27.108
Mm-hmm.

22:27.966 --> 22:30.090
Well I'll tell 'em whatever they want.

22:31.106 --> 22:33.126
Yeah, what time?

22:34.514 --> 22:35.366
Sure.

22:36.581 --> 22:38.720
OK. Alright, bye.

23:10.393 --> 23:11.462
Nurse Atkins?

23:11.788 --> 23:13.066
Nurse Atkins?

23:13.909 --> 23:15.747
Doreen, get back into bed.

23:15.776 --> 23:16.842
Where's Joshua?

23:18.504 --> 23:19.536
Where is he?

23:20.393 --> 23:22.275
I'll... I'll find out for you right now.

23:22.291 --> 23:23.748
- Where's Josh?
- Ms Miles?

23:23.766 --> 23:24.653
Everything alright?

23:24.774 --> 23:27.164
Did one of the officers
take the baby back to H2?

23:27.890 --> 23:29.328
I don't think so. Why would they?

23:30.992 --> 23:32.301
Where is he?

23:32.994 --> 23:34.181
Where is he?

23:34.680 --> 23:37.876
- Just jump into bed.
- No! No, where's Joshua?

24:04.173 --> 24:06.071
Thanks for fucking up my life.

24:13.786 --> 24:15.877
I don't know about you,
but it seems extraordinary

24:15.887 --> 24:18.119
to me that your lawyer
rings up in the middle of...

24:18.320 --> 24:18.915
Yeah!

24:20.394 --> 24:22.107
Sir, there's been a shooting in Ringwood.

24:22.317 --> 24:23.424
The shooter called 000.

24:23.434 --> 24:25.567
Said it's related to the
Harry Smith investigation.

24:27.340 --> 24:29.864
Interview suspended at 4:58.

24:30.514 --> 24:33.590
We are now crossing live to our
reporter who is at the scene.

24:33.710 --> 24:36.090
- What can you tell us, Simon?
- Thank you, John.

24:36.139 --> 24:40.564
Well, dramatic scenes unfolding
here as police arrest the suspected

24:40.596 --> 24:43.044
Red Right Hand leader at this house

24:43.076 --> 24:45.702
moments ago thanks to an anonymous tip off

24:45.737 --> 24:48.437
from an inmate at Wentworth
Correctional Centre.

24:48.707 --> 24:51.815
Karen Proctor is expected to be
charged with a string of offences,

24:51.857 --> 24:54.817
including the assault of
an Albert Park businessman.

24:54.936 --> 24:57.477
The charges will be heard
in court early next week.

25:09.959 --> 25:10.825
You're late.

25:12.748 --> 25:14.463
I've come straight from the Board.

25:16.647 --> 25:19.598
If they haven't already, they'll be
calling soon to arrange a meeting.

25:22.648 --> 25:24.395
I've submitted a statement de

25:24.515 --> 25:26.765
tailing your inappropriate conduct

25:26.783 --> 25:28.828
and involvement in several major incidents.

25:31.121 --> 25:32.221
Is this a joke?

25:34.379 --> 25:35.187
No.

25:35.523 --> 25:36.883
No, Governor.

25:38.745 --> 25:40.369
And I've made a formal request

25:40.380 --> 25:42.458
to have you removed from that position.

25:42.934 --> 25:44.188
On what basis?

25:45.512 --> 25:46.839
Details are in the statement.

25:46.857 --> 25:48.522
I'd rather hear it from you.

25:51.353 --> 25:52.712
Lucy Gambaro

25:52.760 --> 25:54.472
has made an official complaint.

25:54.518 --> 25:56.333
She claims you pushed her down the stairs.

25:56.371 --> 25:57.882
Fiction. Next.

25:58.207 --> 26:00.830
Mr Fletcher has made accusations

26:00.952 --> 26:03.597
regarding your treatment
of both him and Mr Jackson.

26:03.759 --> 26:05.449
I've also detailed the allegations

26:05.486 --> 26:07.439
concerning the abuse of Jodie Spiteri

26:07.492 --> 26:09.420
and the attack on Bea Smith.

26:16.824 --> 26:18.099
Ms Ferguson.

26:19.554 --> 26:21.425
Your mother was right about you.

26:21.840 --> 26:23.893
You are such a disappointment.

26:25.570 --> 26:28.224
I am doing what is best for
the women of this prison.

26:30.384 --> 26:31.493
And me.

26:37.598 --> 26:39.134
That's probably the Board.

26:50.754 --> 26:52.040
Governor, sorry.

26:52.487 --> 26:54.620
- It's Anderson's baby.
- What's happened?

26:54.743 --> 26:55.883
He's gone missing.

26:58.855 --> 27:00.581
Jianna, when did you last see him?

27:00.640 --> 27:03.333
- It's Doreen.
- Just shut up! Tell me.

27:03.534 --> 27:05.261
Um, before I fell asleep.

27:05.319 --> 27:07.739
- And when was that?
- About twenty minutes ago.

27:07.965 --> 27:09.288
I want an immediate lockdown.

27:09.316 --> 27:09.994
Yes, Governor.

27:10.834 --> 27:12.219
This is Sierra 6 to all units.

27:12.244 --> 27:14.646
We are in immediate lockdown. I
repeat, we are in immediate lockdown.

27:15.089 --> 27:17.335
He won't take your baby again.

27:19.462 --> 27:20.220
He?

27:21.891 --> 27:23.146
You know who took him?

27:26.214 --> 27:27.468
There's something else.

27:27.543 --> 27:30.910
Doreen's test results just came back
and there were drugs in her system.

27:30.953 --> 27:31.651
What?

27:32.005 --> 27:33.690
But I haven't taken any...

27:34.476 --> 27:35.983
Oh, god.

27:36.225 --> 27:37.450
Oh, my god.

27:38.577 --> 27:39.796
Where's Jess?

27:40.254 --> 27:42.193
Jess. Jess has my baby.

27:42.313 --> 27:43.773
She has Joshua!

27:45.369 --> 27:49.767
No, I have to find Jess. She's
got Joshua. She's got my son!

27:57.429 --> 27:59.066
That's better, isn't it?

27:59.438 --> 28:00.734
It's quiet down here.

28:02.222 --> 28:04.493
Attention compound, this is a lockdown.

28:04.706 --> 28:07.700
All prisoners are to report
to their units immediately.

28:14.307 --> 28:15.692
Come on, ladies!

28:16.337 --> 28:17.930
Hey, Ms Miles, why the lockdown?

28:18.051 --> 28:20.166
- Have you seen Warner?
- No, why?

28:20.210 --> 28:22.177
She and Anderson's baby have gone missing.

28:23.031 --> 28:24.928
Why the fuck would she take the baby?

28:25.315 --> 28:26.414
No sign, Sierra 3.

28:26.425 --> 28:28.121
We're heading for the
kitchen and dining room now.

28:34.307 --> 28:36.865
Sierra 3, this is Sierra
9. C block is clear.

28:37.865 --> 28:41.334
Roger that, Sierra 9. Move
onto J Block with Sierra 8.

28:41.573 --> 28:43.215
Copy that, Sierra 3.

28:46.350 --> 28:48.744
J Block clear, over.

28:51.992 --> 28:54.058
Sierra 5, what's your location?

28:55.797 --> 28:57.087
You're so beautiful.

28:58.743 --> 29:00.940
You don't deserve to be laughed at,

29:02.009 --> 29:03.086
or hurt,

29:03.890 --> 29:06.178
or abandoned like I was.

29:07.603 --> 29:09.524
You deserve peace.

29:12.089 --> 29:15.035
I helped little Madison find peace.

29:16.883 --> 29:18.902
She's in a better place now.

29:20.613 --> 29:22.357
She'll take good care of you.

29:22.636 --> 29:24.243
What are they doing? Have they found him?

29:24.262 --> 29:26.757
Everyone's looking for him, Doreen, OK?

29:26.789 --> 29:29.002
I just need you to try and calm down.

29:29.039 --> 29:30.338
Just breathe.

29:30.379 --> 29:31.832
Breathe, OK?

29:34.313 --> 29:37.180
Please, you've gotta find
him. You have to find him.

29:37.872 --> 29:40.986
Please, you have to find my son!

29:51.755 --> 29:53.309
Don't fight it.

29:54.156 --> 29:55.563
Go to Madison.

29:58.678 --> 30:01.009
Go to sleep, my beautiful boy.

30:15.521 --> 30:17.012
Put him down, Warner.

30:20.086 --> 30:22.014
I was saving him.

30:25.720 --> 30:26.969
Put...

30:27.697 --> 30:29.067
him...

30:29.889 --> 30:31.234
down.

30:32.220 --> 30:33.855
I wasn't hurting him.

30:34.394 --> 30:35.922
Honestly.

30:39.413 --> 30:41.770
I just wanted him to find some peace.

31:37.490 --> 31:38.721
You know that guy?

31:38.945 --> 31:40.799
Yeah, he ran me down 7 months ago.

31:40.833 --> 31:42.413
Came back to finish the job.

31:42.479 --> 31:43.982
He's working for Ferguson.

31:44.506 --> 31:46.482
- Know his name?
- No.

31:47.362 --> 31:49.224
We've got ID in his wallet.

31:53.703 --> 31:55.092
Nils Jesper.

32:07.183 --> 32:08.013
Hello?

32:09.857 --> 32:11.013
Can I help you?

32:16.912 --> 32:18.337
Can you get what you can off that?

32:18.653 --> 32:20.533
- Find out where the last call came from.
- Sure.

32:20.567 --> 32:22.636
Take care of him, and
I'll ride in the ambulance.

32:35.711 --> 32:39.243
What to do. What to do,
what to do. What to do.

32:41.204 --> 32:45.818
What to do. What to do,
what to do. What to do.

32:51.089 --> 32:52.711
Just tell me what to...

33:25.835 --> 33:29.031
It's OK. It's OK. It's
OK. We'll be out soon.

33:57.185 --> 33:59.953
Shh, it's OK.

34:00.075 --> 34:02.159
It's OK, it's OK.

35:38.100 --> 35:40.648
Assistance is required!

35:42.920 --> 35:44.506
Officers!

35:45.611 --> 35:48.512
Officers, assistance is required!

35:48.800 --> 35:51.556
Storage area! Industries!

35:55.381 --> 35:56.774
Assistance!

36:00.855 --> 36:04.414
I need help?! I need assistance!

36:04.567 --> 36:06.934
I have a baby!

36:10.964 --> 36:12.178
Evacuate the building.

36:12.188 --> 36:13.663
This is not a drill.

36:13.713 --> 36:15.678
Keep calm and proceed to muster points.

36:15.714 --> 36:16.874
We're evacuating the building.

36:19.621 --> 36:21.132
Hey, where's the fire?

36:21.160 --> 36:23.278
- I don't know.
- Hey, what's going on? Where's Joshua?

36:23.297 --> 36:25.464
An immediate override on
all internal security gates.

36:25.492 --> 36:26.888
- Repeat, unlock the gates.
- Ms Miles, have you found Joshua yet?

36:26.897 --> 36:29.278
No. Everyone to emergency muster points!

36:29.287 --> 36:31.317
- What about Jess?
- Jenkins, go! I don't know.

36:31.336 --> 36:33.177
I'll evacuate J Block.
You move on to C and D.

36:33.785 --> 36:34.629
Ms Miles?

36:35.097 --> 36:36.507
Has anyone seen Ferguson?

36:36.575 --> 36:37.294
No.

36:39.132 --> 36:40.547
Evacuate the building.

36:40.604 --> 36:41.933
This is not a drill.

36:42.051 --> 36:44.331
Keep calm and proceed to muster points.

36:47.066 --> 36:48.841
- Mum.
- Hey. Hey!

36:48.852 --> 36:50.207
We heard about Josh. Have they found him?

36:50.250 --> 36:51.579
No. They think Jess has got him.

36:51.589 --> 36:53.734
Of course she fuckin' has.

36:53.857 --> 36:56.267
I'm not waiting for the
screws to find him. Come on.

36:56.715 --> 36:59.215
Hey, Franky. Franky, where you going?

36:59.266 --> 37:00.998
- Bea!
- Franky!

37:04.587 --> 37:06.115
Evacuate the building.

37:06.133 --> 37:07.636
This is not a drill.

37:07.648 --> 37:10.104
Keep calm and proceed to muster points.

37:11.858 --> 37:14.517
Sierra 7, why are the gates still locked?

37:14.694 --> 37:16.251
The fire has caused electrical faults.

37:16.262 --> 37:17.843
We need to override them individually.

37:17.998 --> 37:19.324
Right, well get a move on.

37:19.648 --> 37:21.692
The fire brigade's on the
way. Where's Anderson's baby?

37:21.707 --> 37:23.610
The only area we can't
get to is Industries.

37:23.667 --> 37:25.379
- Smoke's too thick.
- Must be where it started.

37:25.672 --> 37:27.621
We have to leave it to the firies. Come on.

37:29.892 --> 37:31.438
- Let's get to Industries.
- OK, we split up.

37:31.460 --> 37:32.825
You take the corridor behind the laundry.

37:34.791 --> 37:36.023
Evacuate the building.

37:36.539 --> 37:37.652
This is not a drill.

37:37.770 --> 37:39.632
Keep calm and proceed to muster points.

37:42.458 --> 37:43.841
OK, keep moving!

37:44.646 --> 37:46.173
OK, this way Doreen. Keep walking.

37:46.186 --> 37:48.692
Where is he? Where is my son?

37:48.703 --> 37:51.692
Where is he? Joshua!
You have to find Joshua!

37:51.736 --> 37:54.260
- Stay calm.
- Please help me find him!

37:55.350 --> 37:56.171
Liz!

37:56.291 --> 37:59.655
- Where's Bea and Franky?
- Oh, god, they went to get the baby.

38:19.439 --> 38:20.871
Hurry!

38:23.057 --> 38:25.274
- What have you done?
- It was Warner!

38:26.149 --> 38:29.005
- Give me the baby!
- Alright! Go, go, go!

38:42.135 --> 38:44.441
- Let me in, please!
- Stop, stop!

38:46.179 --> 38:49.392
- J Block clear, over.
- OK, good. Now shut down the mains.

38:49.400 --> 38:50.930
The fire's right under the kitchen.

38:51.122 --> 38:53.483
Get everyone away from the
building and start a headcount.

38:53.522 --> 38:56.309
- Everyone to the Muster Point.
- You're hurting me!

38:58.109 --> 39:00.256
All muster points, start headcount.

39:10.325 --> 39:13.209
Red? Red? Get up.

39:13.330 --> 39:14.737
Red, get up.

39:15.835 --> 39:17.576
Come with me.

39:20.485 --> 39:22.540
Come on, get up. We gotta go.

39:25.668 --> 39:27.322
What was that?

39:38.907 --> 39:40.699
Josh.

39:41.752 --> 39:43.308
You right?

39:50.181 --> 39:51.015
The grille.

39:51.242 --> 39:53.446
- Huh?
- The grille. See if you can kick it out.

39:53.802 --> 39:55.175
Shhh.

40:10.894 --> 40:12.150
OK!

40:13.160 --> 40:14.834
Quick, you go.

40:35.241 --> 40:37.277
Go! Get him outside!

40:37.314 --> 40:41.202
- Go, Bea, now. Go!
- I'll get some help!

40:54.086 --> 40:56.312
Got any bright ideas, bitch?

41:18.547 --> 41:20.222
OK everyone, stand back.

41:20.341 --> 41:22.265
Keep moving. Fire and police are here.

41:22.329 --> 41:23.607
Vera, is everyone out?

41:23.623 --> 41:26.740
- Smith, Doyle, Warner, the baby...
- Shit.

41:26.752 --> 41:28.590
- And Ferguson.
- Joshua!

41:28.637 --> 41:30.172
Bea's got Joshua!

41:30.412 --> 41:32.398
Josh! Joshua!

41:32.455 --> 41:33.994
- I need some help!
- Bea!

41:34.004 --> 41:36.047
OK, keep back.

41:43.564 --> 41:46.407
Thank you! Thank you!

41:46.661 --> 41:49.854
Nurse Atkins, will you take Anderson
and the baby over to the paramedics?

41:49.899 --> 41:52.083
Everyone back into the Muster Area.

41:53.217 --> 41:56.047
- Hey, Smith, what are you doing? Stay here!
- I know where they are!

41:56.057 --> 41:57.472
- Bea!
- Smith, come back!

41:57.505 --> 41:58.399
Wait!

41:58.469 --> 41:59.631
Will!

42:06.752 --> 42:09.826
Franky! Franky!

42:11.414 --> 42:12.798
She's not moving.

42:12.919 --> 42:14.065
Franky!

42:39.769 --> 42:40.989
Franky!

42:42.326 --> 42:44.910
- Franky! Franky!
- Sierra 4,

42:44.927 --> 42:47.254
- report your position.
- Come on, wake up!

42:49.826 --> 42:50.771
You right?

42:55.452 --> 42:58.525
- Get her out of here, alright?
- What are you doing? No! No.

42:59.030 --> 43:00.264
Leave her!

43:01.282 --> 43:03.714
- Let her burn!
- I said get out!

43:06.859 --> 43:08.283
Fuck!

43:14.269 --> 43:18.116
Ferguson, come on, get up!
Come on, wake up. Come on.

43:22.783 --> 43:26.613
This was you. You started this.

43:26.771 --> 43:29.220
You don't know what the
fuck you're talking about.

43:29.824 --> 43:32.708
My Jianna hanged herself because of you.

43:32.719 --> 43:34.857
- Jianna didn't...
- You took her child away.

43:34.885 --> 43:37.555
Jianna didn't kill herself.
The prisoners lynched her.

43:38.873 --> 43:39.651
What?

43:40.021 --> 43:42.083
They found out about
your relationship with her

43:42.092 --> 43:43.417
and they killed her for it!

43:44.379 --> 43:45.269
Liar!

43:46.258 --> 43:49.338
- You're a liar.
- We've got a visual. Standby, all medical units.

43:49.708 --> 43:50.594
Bea.

43:51.710 --> 43:52.591
Bea!

43:52.618 --> 43:55.033
Oh, my god, Franky!

44:01.223 --> 44:03.771
Clear this space. Space, please.

44:07.587 --> 44:08.651
Franky!

44:14.955 --> 44:16.558
Easy, easy, you're OK.

44:36.906 --> 44:38.848
If you rule through chaos,

44:38.968 --> 44:41.422
you reap what you sow.

45:36.365 --> 45:37.779
Next time you get out,

45:37.899 --> 45:39.700
- stay out.
- I will.

45:40.063 --> 45:43.404
- Ya fuckin' alco.
- Ya fuckin' lezzo.

45:43.525 --> 45:44.832
Bugger off.

45:55.676 --> 45:57.343
I fuckin' love ya.

46:13.895 --> 46:15.277
So you made it.

46:15.506 --> 46:17.064
It looks like it.

46:19.104 --> 46:21.528
Why do I feel like crying?

46:21.607 --> 46:23.835
It's 'cause you want me.

46:27.543 --> 46:30.415
- You look after my girls.
- Always.

46:31.102 --> 46:32.852
Don't fuck up.

46:33.090 --> 46:34.718
Off you go.

46:40.823 --> 46:43.394
Fuck this place!

46:46.128 --> 46:47.905
Franky!

47:21.181 --> 47:23.819
Whoo!
