well, (scoffs)
that just curls my 'stache.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.919
Hey, Flanders,
why don't you take some advice

04:13.921 --> 04:15.854
from your Bible and zip it?

04:15.856 --> 04:17.689
Oh, where does
the Bible say zip it?

04:17.691 --> 04:20.726
It's the first thing the
burning bush said to Moses.

04:20.728 --> 04:22.761
Thank you for teaching
us Scripture.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.930
Thank you.

04:28.701 --> 04:30.369
You know,
all this helping others

04:30.371 --> 04:33.405

05:00.301 --> 05:03.101
A family vacation
to the Grand Canyon.

05:03.103 --> 05:05.771
The winner: Ned Flanders.

the best job wins.

NED: Mm-hmm!

05:11.912 --> 05:13.111
But this gift certificate

05:13.113 --> 05:14.413
is for two families.

05:14.415 --> 05:16.982
Hey, Reverend, we'd love it if
you and Helen would join us.

05:16.984 --> 05:19.051
Um... uh... uh...

05:20.086 --> 05:21.086
Mm...

05:21.088 --> 05:22.921
Of course we'd love
to join you,

05:22.923 --> 05:24.289
but I've noticed
that you and Homer

05:24.291 --> 05:26.291
haven't been the
friendliest "neighboreenos,"

05:26.293 --> 05:29.094
if you get my diddly.

05:29.096 --> 05:32.264
Uh, well, Ned, I think
the Lord would want you

05:32.266 --> 05:34.766
to take the Simpsons
on this trip.

05:34.768 --> 05:35.667
Our Lord?

05:35.669 --> 05:37.602
Yes. Our Lord.

05:37.604 --> 05:40.105
For would it not
indeed be glorious,

05:40.107 --> 05:42.007
if in visiting a natural chasm,

05:42.009 --> 05:45.177
two quarrelsome neighbors
would bridge the chasm

05:45.179 --> 05:47.813
of their own discord.

05:47.815 --> 05:50.816
Well, I guess if Job
could accept his burdens.

05:50.818 --> 05:52.117
Uh, in America,

05:52.119 --> 05:54.653
it's pronounced "job,"
Flanders.

05:54.655 --> 05:55.987
(laughing): We can settle it
when we're zipped up

05:55.989 --> 05:57.622
together in a sleeping bag.

05:57.624 --> 05:58.824
(groans)

05:58.826 --> 06:00.125
Welcome aboard.

06:00.127 --> 06:01.960
Oh, oh, we'd love to go,

06:01.962 --> 06:05.464
but is it such a good idea
to travel with another family?

06:05.466 --> 06:07.032
It's fun.
We travel with the Hibberts

06:07.034 --> 06:08.467
all the time.

06:08.469 --> 06:11.136
We ran into you once,
in Cincinnati.

06:11.138 --> 06:12.170
And we had dinner.

06:12.172 --> 06:14.039
We slid our tables together.

06:14.041 --> 06:17.542
We were in a booth
we could not get out of.

06:18.344 --> 06:20.312
(groaning sadly)

06:20.314 --> 06:21.880
Homie, we should go.

06:21.882 --> 06:24.316
You and Ned need
to learn to get along.

06:24.318 --> 06:26.985
You said the same thing
about me and Bart.

06:26.987 --> 06:30.155
No. The judge said the same
thing about you and Bart.

06:30.157 --> 06:32.724
Judges. If they were any
good they'd be lawyers.

06:32.726 --> 06:33.992
Okay, we'll go.

06:33.994 --> 06:35.160
But if Flanders
gets so annoying

06:35.162 --> 06:36.495
that I can't
take it anymore,

06:36.497 --> 06:38.830
the code word is octopus.

06:38.832 --> 06:40.165
Can it be something else?

06:40.167 --> 06:42.868
I don't like things
with hidden beaks.

06:42.870 --> 06:45.237
Octopus or nothing.

06:45.239 --> 06:47.072
Okay.

06:47.074 --> 06:48.840
So we took eight-year-old Bart,

06:48.842 --> 06:51.176
and six-year-old Lisa.

06:51.178 --> 06:52.744
After ten hours of driving,

06:52.746 --> 06:55.847
I finally saw the most
glorious site.

Canyon was created by erosion?

07:39.226 --> 07:41.927
And before 1871,
it was called Big Canyon?

07:41.929 --> 07:42.961

We're here to enjoy
ourselves.

your head slightly,

08:13.594 --> 08:15.961
I think you'll be
pleasantly surprised.

11:01.128 --> 11:02.927
go downhill.

11:02.929 --> 11:04.996

13:22.435 --> 13:24.135
