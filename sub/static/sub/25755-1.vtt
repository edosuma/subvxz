09:38.625 --> 09:42.666
{\ blur3.7}My boyfriend and I have been dating for ten
years, he doesn't peek an eye at other women.</b>

09:43.166 --> 09:46.083

{\ blur3.7}Just wanted to let you know that
I reserved a table by the window.</b>

{\ blur3.7}Bitch, I'm gonna blow your head off.</b>

17:41.666 --> 17:43.208
{\ blur3.7}Oh, we're in the same business.</b>

17:43.500 --> 17:45.583
{\ blur3.7}You're so much uglier in real life.</b>

17:45.916 --> 17:47.559
{\ blur3.7}Your husband should've chosen me.</b>

17:47.583 --> 17:51.250
{\ blur3.7}He didn't want to spend time
with you on his birthday.</b>

17:52.833 --> 17:54.291
{\ blur3.7}What are you laughing at?</b>

17:55.291 --> 17:59.375
{\ blur3.7}I'm laughing because he didn't want to
spend time with you either.</b>

18:03.125 --> 18:04.415
{\ blur3.7}Why don't you shoot?</b>

18:04.416 --> 18:05.500
{\ blur3.7}Why aren't you taking the shot?</b>

18:07.416 --> 18:08.541
{\ blur3.7}I'm thinking of something</b>

18:09.708 --> 18:11.208

{\ blur3.7}I wonder... who he's with right now.</b>

18:16.750 --> 18:18.416

18:18.750 --> 18:20.500
{\ blur3.7}Shut up, it takes time to load</b>

18:20.958 --> 18:22.749

{\ blur3.7}What are you talking about?</b>

18:23.709 --> 18:25.332

{\ blur3.7}Say 'mistress' again,

18:27.041 --> 18:28.583
{\ blur3.7}Mistress! Shoot me!</b>

18:37.041 --> 18:38.500

18:39.875 --> 18:41.875
{\ blur3.7}My husband doesn't eat pigeon.</b>

18:42.666 --> 18:46.833
{\ blur3.7}He doesn't have to order it,
the tofu is famous too.</b>

18:48.000 --> 18:51.457
{\ blur3.7}It's a hotel, and there are rooms!</b>

18:51.458 --> 18:54.125
{\ blur3.7}He's meeting someone there, you moron!</b>

19:01.416 --> 19:03.458
{\ blur3.7}I just wanted to lie to myself.</b>

19:16.125 --> 19:18.125
{\ blur3.7}I can't believe he has another woman.</b>

19:25.208 --> 19:25.958
{\ blur3.7}What are you doing?</b>

19:25.959 --> 19:27.750
{\ blur3.7}I'm gonna kill them both.</b>

19:28.750 --> 19:30.291
{\ blur3.7}A mistress killing another mistress?</b>

{\ blur3.7}Stop calling me that!</b>

19:33.625 --> 19:35.791
{\ blur3.7}I've been together with him for ten years
and I didn't know you existed.</b>

19:38.875 --> 19:42.582
{\ blur3.7}Sorry, but you're still a mistress</b>

19:42.583 --> 19:44.625
{\ blur3.7}I'm gonna kill that bitch.</b>

19:45.625 --> 19:47.458
{\ blur3.7}Either we go kill her together.</b>

19:49.208 --> 19:50.541
{\ blur3.7}Or you just go ahead and kill me now.</b>

21:20.250 --> 21:21.250

21:47.750 --> 21:49.040
{\ blur3.7}I'm cooking...</b>

21:49.041 --> 21:50.166
{\ blur3.7}No thanks.</b>

21:53.125 --> 21:55.583
{\ blur3.7}Do you like that girl?</b>

21:59.416 --> 22:03.416
{\ blur3.7}You need to clean up if you
wanna marry a girl.</b>

22:04.291 --> 22:05.916
{\ blur3.7}Much better now.</b>

22:37.208 --> 22:38.458
{\ blur3.7}Where is David Chow?</b>

22:51.166 --> 22:52.583
{\ blur3.7}Was he here with a woman?</b>

22:53.333 --> 22:54.625
{\ blur3.7}No.</b>

22:55.583 --> 22:56.791
{\ blur3.7}A man?</b>

22:57.333 --> 22:58.541
{\ blur3.7}No.</b>

22:59.958 --> 23:03.165
{\ blur3.7}Who would come to this kind of place alone?
Asshole!</b>

23:03.166 --> 23:04.708
{\ blur3.7}Ladies</b>

23:06.125 --> 23:07.916
{\ blur3.7}I'm warning you.</b>

23:17.916 --> 23:19.375
{\ blur3.7}Just get me any room.</b>

23:35.541 --> 23:37.166
{\ blur3.7}Why don't we just barge in?</b>

23:41.416 --> 23:42.666
{\ blur3.7}Catching them in the act?</b>

23:45.708 --> 23:46.833
{\ blur3.7}Yes...</b>

24:02.458 --> 24:03.458

{\ blur3.7}Good luck.</b>

24:21.041 --> 24:22.666
{\ blur3.7}Why don't we just barge in?</b>

24:23.208 --> 24:24.665
{\ blur3.7}Didn't you hear?</b>

24:24.666 --> 24:27.541
{\ blur3.7}He's there alone!
The woman isn't here yet.</b>

24:27.833 --> 24:29.291
{\ blur3.7}Let's just wait it out.</b>

24:29.416 --> 24:32.624
{\ blur3.7}You're telling me to wait until
he starts having sex with another woman?</b>

24:32.625 --> 24:34.750
{\ blur3.7}Let him go forward with it this time.</b>

24:37.958 --> 24:40.166
{\ blur3.7}It's gonna be his last time anyway.</b>

25:06.083 --> 25:08.541
{\ blur3.7}These are all the gifts that
you've given me</b>

25:09.041 --> 25:10.957
{\ blur3.7}I'm returning them back to you.</b>

25:10.958 --> 25:12.333
{\ blur3.7}Now we're even.</b>

25:25.083 --> 25:26.999
{\ blur3.7}Out of my way!
Calm down!</b>

25:27.000 --> 25:28.332
{\ blur3.7}It's none of your business! Go away!
Let go of the woman.</b>

25:28.333 --> 25:29.582
{\ blur3.7}Stand right there, don't move.</b>

25:29.583 --> 25:30.291
{\ blur3.7}Drop your weapon!</b>

25:30.292 --> 25:32.958
{\ blur3.7}Don't come closer, or else I'll kill her!</b>

25:35.958 --> 25:37.416
{\ blur3.7}Calm down! Calm down!</b>

25:37.958 --> 25:40.875
{\ blur3.7}Tell me what happened.</b>

25:41.250 --> 25:42.415
{\ blur3.7}She's cheating on me</b>

25:42.416 --> 25:44.124
{\ blur3.7}I didn't.</b>

25:44.125 --> 25:46.790
{\ blur3.7}Let him speak, carry on.</b>

25:46.791 --> 25:48.333
{\ blur3.7}She's seducing my little brother.</b>

25:48.541 --> 25:49.832
{\ blur3.7}You're delusional!</b>

25:49.833 --> 25:51.601
{\ blur3.7}She's also seducing
the security guard downstairs</b>

25:51.625 --> 25:52.934
{\ blur3.7}I didn't!</b>

25:52.958 --> 25:54.832
{\ blur3.7}Stop pretending!</b>

25:54.833 --> 25:59.374
{\ blur3.7}Listen to me, I have a boyfriend too.</b>

25:59.375 --> 26:00.790
{\ blur3.7}What does that have to do with me?</b>

26:00.791 --> 26:02.540
{\ blur3.7}He also has other women.</b>

26:02.541 --> 26:04.851
{\ blur3.7}And he also has a wife.</b>

26:04.875 --> 26:06.665
{\ blur3.7}Because you're the only who</b>

26:06.666 --> 26:08.916
{\ blur3.7}would lose everything by losing him</b>

26:09.250 --> 26:11.309
{\ blur3.7}I agree with you.</b>

26:11.333 --> 26:13.267
{\ blur3.7}Shut up! Shut up!</b>

26:13.291 --> 26:16.851
{\ blur3.7}But I stayed with him,
and I still love him.</b>

26:16.875 --> 26:18.309
{\ blur3.7}Why?</b>

26:18.333 --> 26:22.309
{\ blur3.7}Because if you lose him,
you'll lose everything.</b>

26:22.333 --> 26:25.249
{\ blur3.7}Who would do such a thing?</b>

26:25.250 --> 26:28.000
{\ blur3.7}That would be me, I swear!</b>

26:28.250 --> 26:29.541
{\ blur3.7}I don't believe you.</b>

26:31.666 --> 26:34.124
{\ blur3.7}Call him and prove it to me</b>

26:34.125 --> 26:37.708
{\ blur3.7}I'm on a mission, how can I call him?</b>

26:44.375 --> 26:46.375
{\ blur3.7}What's that sound?
My boyfriend.</b>

{\ blur3.7}Use the speaker.</b>

{\ blur3.7}Honey, I love you.</b>

28:08.541 --> 28:10.291
{\ blur3.7}All men deserve to die!</b>

28:24.541 --> 28:26.082
{\ blur3.7}Were you seducing other men?</b>

28:26.083 --> 28:27.458
{\ blur3.7}Two of them?</b>

28:27.625 --> 28:30.665
{\ blur3.7}It's not two people,</b>

28:30.666 --> 28:32.583
{\ blur3.7}it's the same person.</b>

28:32.916 --> 28:36.125
{\ blur3.7}His brother is the security guard.</b>

28:36.375 --> 28:38.000
{\ blur3.7}So you did seduce him?</b>

28:38.166 --> 28:39.333
{\ blur3.7}I said I didn't!</b>

28:39.500 --> 28:42.333
{\ blur3.7}Convince me, and I'll let you live.</b>

28:42.875 --> 28:47.500
{\ blur3.7}The other day, his brother came
to our house to fix the pipes.</b>

28:47.916 --> 28:50.457
{\ blur3.7}I saw that...</b>

28:50.458 --> 28:51.790
{\ blur3.7}he got all wet.</b>

28:51.791 --> 28:53.583
{\ blur3.7}So I got him a change of clothes.</b>

28:54.041 --> 28:57.791
{\ blur3.7}But he suddenly turned into
his security guard self.</b>

28:58.333 --> 29:00.207
{\ blur3.7}And asked for a service fee.</b>

29:00.208 --> 29:04.000
{\ blur3.7}We didn't have money,
so I asked if we can pay later.</b>

29:04.500 --> 29:09.249
{\ blur3.7}Then he turned back into 'brother' mode
and said he'd lend us money</b>

29:09.250 --> 29:12.082
{\ blur3.7}I was overjoyed, so I hugged him.</b>

29:12.083 --> 29:15.790
{\ blur3.7}My husband saw it and said that
I was seducing him.</b>

29:15.791 --> 29:18.166
{\ blur3.7}So were you seducing him?</b>

29:18.458 --> 29:20.083
{\ blur3.7}No!</b>

29:21.333 --> 29:23.208
{\ blur3.7}I think you're lying.</b>

29:23.625 --> 29:25.083
{\ blur3.7}Then I guess I did!</b>

29:25.291 --> 29:26.916
{\ blur3.7}Then you deserve to die.</b>

29:32.625 --> 29:35.291
{\ blur3.7}I hate people who cheat.</b>

29:39.416 --> 29:40.184
{\ blur3.7}Sweetheart?</b>

29:40.208 --> 29:44.041
{\ blur3.7}I made you... some food...</b>

29:48.958 --> 29:49.875

{\ blur3.7}So is your sweetheart beside you?</b>

29:58.916 --> 30:00.082
{\ blur3.7}None of your business</b>

{\ blur3.7}I'm here to kill the both of you.</b>

30:03.416 --> 30:04.957
{\ blur3.7}So it's definitely my business</b>

30:13.416 --> 30:15.291
{\ blur3.7}Yes, don%laugh.</b>

30:15.583 --> 30:17.625
{\ blur3.7}Oh! David dumped her.</b>

30:26.250 --> 30:30.415
{\ blur3.7}Bitch, don't laugh, I've had enough of you</b>

30:30.416 --> 30:33.415
{\ blur3.7}I'm gonna kill you before
I kill your husband.</b>

30:33.416 --> 30:35.290
{\ blur3.7}Alright, come on!</b>

30:35.291 --> 30:38.458
{\ blur3.7}Who are you talking to?
Is the mistress with you?</b>

30:40.583 --> 30:44.416
{\ blur3.7}She knows your full name, mistress.</b>

30:46.958 --> 30:48.500
{\ blur3.7}Who are you calling 'mistress'?</b>

30:48.666 --> 30:50.249
{\ blur3.7}I've kept away from you two,</b>

30:50.250 --> 30:52.791
{\ blur3.7}and now you're messing with me?</b>

30:52.916 --> 30:54.124
{\ blur3.7}I'm gonna come</b>

30:54.125 --> 30:56.290
{\ blur3.7}and get you after I hang up.</b>

30:56.291 --> 30:57.083

{\ blur3.7}Who is she calling 'mistress'?</b>

31:09.333 --> 31:11.166
{\ blur3.7}Whoever is angrier.</b>

32:43.625 --> 32:46.125
{\ blur3.7}A mistress does sneak around a lot</b>

32:46.250 --> 32:49.125
{\ blur3.7}I do whatever it takes to win.</b>

32:59.541 --> 33:01.250
{\ blur3.7}Can I finish my cigarette?</b>

{\ blur3.7}What are you doing?</b>

33:46.250 --> 33:48.291
{\ blur3.7}Nothing, just finding somewhere
to put your cigarettes.</b>

33:56.416 --> 33:59.791
{\ blur3.7}In the movies,
an assassin always saves one bullet.</b>

34:00.541 --> 34:03.791
{\ blur3.7}To kill their target, or to commit suicide,
is that true?</b>

34:04.125 --> 34:06.916
{\ blur3.7}You believe that shit? It's bullshit.</b>

34:09.625 --> 34:11.833
{\ blur3.7}I don't have anywhere to put your smokes,
here you go.</b>

34:21.458 --> 34:22.833
{\ blur3.7}And you said that movies were bullshit.</b>

34:23.291 --> 34:26.875
{\ blur3.7}I didn't leave a bullet, I left a grenade.</b>

34:27.000 --> 34:27.833

{\ blur3.7}You think I'd tell you?</b>

36:13.291 --> 36:16.458
{\ blur3.7}I thought we were gonna have a duel.</b>

36:17.916 --> 36:21.500
{\ blur3.7}This topic is getting boring,
I don't wanna talk about it anymore.</b>

36:36.625 --> 36:37.625

{\ blur3.7}I'm busy, I'm carrying a gun
in one hand and a phone in the other.</b>

36:50.083 --> 36:53.083
{\ blur3.7}It's hot as fuck, why would you talk'</b>

36:55.208 --> 36:56.833
{\ blur3.7}Does your husband say that a lot?</b>

36:57.208 --> 36:58.166
{\ blur3.7}What are you talking about?</b>

37:22.750 --> 37:25.000

{\ blur3.7}Do you like to chat after having sex?</b>

37:31.750 --> 37:33.999
{\ blur3.7}Of course, who doesn't?</b>

37:34.000 --> 37:36.250
{\ blur3.7}Some might say that it's 'hot as fuck',
and wouldn't talk</b>

{\ blur3.7}I'll chat with you tomorrow.</b>

37:37.666 --> 37:39.958

37:56.750 --> 37:58.291
{\ blur3.7}But you don't wanna talk about it</b>

37:58.458 --> 38:02.207
{\ blur3.7}I'll put a hands-free device
on the fire extinguisher on the 5/F.</b>

38:02.208 --> 38:03.624
{\ blur3.7}Come and get it.</b>

38:03.625 --> 38:04.957

39:28.458 --> 39:29.666
{\ blur3.7}Not as dumb as I thought</b>

39:34.666 --> 39:36.767
{\ blur3.7}I've been there before.</b>

{\ blur3.7}Do you know why it took me so long?</b>

39:56.333 --> 39:59.457

{\ blur3.7}Yes, it is.</b>

41:05.000 --> 41:07.583
{\ blur3.7}If you try and get it now.</b>

41:07.791 --> 41:10.583
{\ blur3.7}There might just be a
few years still there.</b>

41:11.041 --> 41:13.875
{\ blur3.7}Or else, there won't even be a year left.</b>

41:14.333 --> 41:15.041
{\ blur3.7}What do you think?</b>

41:18.166 --> 41:20.125
{\ blur3.7}Nine thousand years...</b>

{\ blur3.7}Looks like these two bitches are
quite something.</b>

{\ blur3.7}There's still one left, better be careful.</b>

43:16.791 --> 43:19.958
{\ blur3.7}Why does she have the earrings
that David got me?</b>

43:33.750 --> 43:35.333
{\ blur3.7}Shit! My wife is coming home, go!</b>

43:50.083 --> 43:51.833
{\ blur3.7}Want more rice?</b>

44:01.541 --> 44:03.125
{\ blur3.7}Why is there an earring on the ground?</b>

44:07.208 --> 44:09.500
{\ blur3.7}Do you remember how I proposed to you?</b>

44:11.041 --> 44:13.332
{\ blur3.7}You said you'd take me out for a drive.</b>

44:13.333 --> 44:16.708
{\ blur3.7}But when I got on,
I felt something on the seat.</b>

44:17.041 --> 44:18.708
{\ blur3.7}And it was the ring.</b>

44:21.083 --> 44:24.707
{\ blur3.7}Our anniversary isn't until next week.</b>

44:24.708 --> 44:26.041
{\ blur3.7}You're using these tactics already?</b>

44:28.708 --> 44:30.583
{\ blur3.7}Why is there only one?</b>

44:31.041 --> 44:32.875
{\ blur3.7}You'll step on to the next one soon enough.</b>

44:34.083 --> 44:37.041
{\ blur3.7}You're a bad romantic!</b>

44:37.583 --> 44:39.541
{\ blur3.7}Baby, I wanna...</b>

44:41.000 --> 44:44.083
{\ blur3.7}It's 'hot as fuck', maybe later?
After dinner?</b>

44:50.958 --> 44:53.540
{\ blur3.7}If I shoot the bitch in the head.</b>

44:53.541 --> 44:56.250
{\ blur3.7}Her blood will mess up my earrings.</b>

45:32.458 --> 45:33.833
{\ blur3.7}What's happening?</b>

45:56.416 --> 45:57.833
{\ blur3.7}You're messed up.</b>

would kill you.</b>

{\ blur3.7}Just let them be, they're
not affecting you.</b>

46:34.625 --> 46:36.458
{\ blur3.7}Where did the bitch go?</b>

47:12.875 --> 47:14.208
{\ blur3.7}It's you.</b>

47:15.083 --> 47:17.458
{\ blur3.7}I should've shot you in the head
in the elevator.</b>

47:30.583 --> 47:31.500
{\ blur3.7}Is this yours?</b>

47:46.083 --> 47:48.958
{\ blur3.7}This looks fun, having a family meeting?</b>

47:49.750 --> 47:52.208
{\ blur3.7}It's 'hot as fuck', why talk now?</b>

47:52.708 --> 47:53.708
{\ blur3.7}Shut up!</b>

47:54.500 --> 47:57.583
{\ blur3.7}The wife is angry, sorry.</b>

47:58.750 --> 48:00.625
{\ blur3.7}And there's an audience.</b>

48:03.125 --> 48:06.625
{\ blur3.7}Don't move, bullets don't see people.</b>

48:47.541 --> 48:49.166
{\ blur3.7}Are you kidding me?</b>

48:50.500 --> 48:52.125
{\ blur3.7}What are you looking at? Make a move!</b>

48:57.750 --> 48:58.916
{\ blur3.7}Aren't you gonna run out of bullets?</b>

49:01.583 --> 49:02.875
{\ blur3.7}I told you so.</b>

49:25.333 --> 49:27.041
{\ blur3.7}She ran out of bullets, get her!</b>

50:07.375 --> 50:10.625
{\ blur3.7}You guys are out too, come in and fight!</b>

50:37.000 --> 50:40.332
{\ blur3.7}This shit is wild, I'm getting a boner</b>

50:40.333 --> 50:41.750
{\ blur3.7}Miss...</b>

53:24.250 --> 53:28.125
{\ blur3.7}Few decades ago,
this was a place for cheating husbands.</b>

53:29.375 --> 53:31.416
{\ blur3.7}But business is bad now.</b>

53:32.666 --> 53:37.583
{\ blur3.7}Look outside, there aren't any customers,
just an old man.</b>

53:41.958 --> 53:44.999
{\ blur3.7}That's why I wanted to meet you here.</b>

53:45.000 --> 53:49.500
{\ blur3.7}Nobody will know what happened here.</b>

53:54.666 --> 53:57.416
{\ blur3.7}Did you turn on the GPS like I asked?</b>

54:09.375 --> 54:11.666
{\ blur3.7}Those two should be on their way here.</b>

54:12.375 --> 54:14.374
{\ blur3.7}What about the SDU chick?</b>

54:14.375 --> 54:17.624
{\ blur3.7}I did as you're told,
and dated her here for my birthday.</b>

54:17.625 --> 54:18.791
{\ blur3.7}She'll be here soon.</b>

54:19.000 --> 54:19.833
{\ blur3.7}Good.</b>

54:20.250 --> 54:21.875
{\ blur3.7}Do you have any other special requests?</b>

54:23.583 --> 54:26.707
{\ blur3.7}No, I just want them to disappear from
the face of the earth.</b>

54:26.708 --> 54:28.916
{\ blur3.7}So we can do whatever we want?</b>

54:29.416 --> 54:30.083
{\ blur3.7}No problem.</b>

54:30.084 --> 54:32.125
{\ blur3.7}Awesome, little brother!
We have games to play.</b>

54:34.916 --> 54:36.000
{\ blur3.7}Can I go now?</b>

54:36.500 --> 54:38.750
{\ blur3.7}Sure, remember to transfer the cash.</b>

54:39.666 --> 54:40.833
{\ blur3.7}Of course.</b>

54:44.000 --> 54:48.309
{\ blur3.7}Sorry, I know it's
unorthodox for me to ask.</b>

54:48.333 --> 54:50.875
{\ blur3.7}But I am a woman after all.</b>

54:51.666 --> 54:53.500
{\ blur3.7}Sol have a question for you.</b>

54:53.833 --> 54:54.642
{\ blur3.7}What is it?</b>

54:54.666 --> 54:57.333
{\ blur3.7}They all love you.</b>

54:58.041 --> 54:59.875
{\ blur3.7}Why do you want them dead?</b>

55:01.416 --> 55:03.374
{\ blur3.7}Because I've met a fourth.</b>

55:03.375 --> 55:06.416
{\ blur3.7}And she wanted me to clear my previous debt
before getting together.</b>

55:08.458 --> 55:09.583
{\ blur3.7}Is she rich?</b>

55:10.041 --> 55:12.958
{\ blur3.7}No, she's very rich.</b>

55:15.041 --> 55:19.458
{\ blur3.7}That's fucked up, but I'll do my job.</b>

55:20.208 --> 55:21.291
{\ blur3.7}Thanks.</b>

55:25.291 --> 55:27.333
{\ blur3.7}Big Po.
Yes.</b>

55:31.916 --> 55:33.708
{\ blur3.7}Old fucker, we need some water!</b>

55:52.583 --> 55:53.958
{\ blur3.7}Miss...</b>

55:54.250 --> 55:55.749
{\ blur3.7}Are you okay?</b>

55:55.750 --> 55:58.375
{\ blur3.7}Do you want her to be your wife?</b>

56:02.291 --> 56:04.916
{\ blur3.7}Mother will take her
to the ceremonial hall with you.</b>

56:12.041 --> 56:13.749
{\ blur3.7}What about these two?</b>

56:13.750 --> 56:15.583
{\ blur3.7}Do whatever you want.</b>

56:18.958 --> 56:19.875
{\ blur3.7}Okay.</b>

56:22.250 --> 56:25.875
{\ blur3.7}Impressive, you're still conscious.</b>

56:26.583 --> 56:27.958
{\ blur3.7}Do you wanna leave?</b>

56:29.583 --> 56:33.375
{\ blur3.7}I'm actually a good guy,
I'll let you leave.</b>

56:34.625 --> 56:35.750
{\ blur3.7}Go ahead.</b>

56:38.833 --> 56:44.666
{\ blur3.7}Hottie, the front door is locked,
use the back door.</b>

56:49.625 --> 56:54.208
{\ blur3.7}But I'll just give you one minute.</b>

56:54.958 --> 56:56.625
{\ blur3.7}I need to get myself ready.</b>

56:57.041 --> 57:01.958
{\ blur3.7}Because I'll rape and kill you
after one minute.</b>

58:13.541 --> 58:14.583
{\ blur3.7}Cut it!</b>

58:19.750 --> 58:21.416
{\ blur3.7}Help me out!</b>

59:10.541 --> 59:15.333
{\ blur3.7}Homes, where are you?</b>

59:39.833 --> 59:40.958
{\ blur3.7}You think I'm stupid?</b>

59:51.416 --> 59:52.541
{\ blur3.7}Hey, asshole.</b>

59:57.333 --> 59:58.500
{\ blur3.7}Get up</b>

01:00:41.291 --> 01:00:43.541
{\ blur3.7}Miss... you're so beautiful.</b>

01:00:48.916 --> 01:00:51.291
{\ blur3.7}My son wants to have sex with you.</b>

01:00:51.458 --> 01:00:52.500
{\ blur3.7}Fuck you!</b>

01:01:02.708 --> 01:01:07.250
{\ blur3.7}Not 'fuck me'... he's gonna fuck you.</b>

01:01:31.875 --> 01:01:35.291
{\ blur3.7}S&M? I like it!</b>

01:01:44.250 --> 01:01:45.582
{\ blur3.7}Are you okay?</b>

01:01:45.583 --> 01:01:47.250
{\ blur3.7}Why do you seem like you're okay?</b>

01:01:49.416 --> 01:01:50.583
{\ blur3.7}I think I blacked out?</b>

01:01:54.708 --> 01:01:55.500
{\ blur3.7}What are you laughing at?</b>

01:01:56.166 --> 01:02:00.541
{\ blur3.7}We wanted to kill each other,
but now we're escaping together.</b>

01:02:01.375 --> 01:02:03.374
{\ blur3.7}Then don't die too soon,</b>

01:02:03.375 --> 01:02:04.832
{\ blur3.7}because I'm gonna kill you
when we get out of here.</b>

01:02:04.833 --> 01:02:06.958
{\ blur3.7}Okay, I'll be waiting.</b>

01:02:44.333 --> 01:02:45.333
{\ blur3.7}Fuckerl.</b>

01:03:33.250 --> 01:03:34.791
{\ blur3.7}And the ceremony begins!</b>

01:03:35.875 --> 01:03:37.958
{\ blur3.7}First bow for the heavens and the earth.</b>

01:03:48.833 --> 01:03:49.791
{\ blur3.7}Bow.</b>

01:03:55.916 --> 01:03:56.875
{\ blur3.7}Bow.</b>

01:04:13.375 --> 01:04:15.208
{\ blur3.7}Second bow for the sacred halls.</b>

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.458
{\ blur3.7}Third bow... are you gonna do it?</b>

01:04:53.916 --> 01:04:57.125
{\ blur3.7}We can have tea after the ceremony.</b>

01:05:03.125 --> 01:05:06.125
{\ blur3.7}Mother, have some tea.
Good boy</b>

01:05:18.166 --> 01:05:23.124
{\ blur3.7}Miss... miss... just do as she says.</b>

01:05:23.125 --> 01:05:26.833
{\ blur3.7}Mother, have some tea...</b>

01:05:28.208 --> 01:05:29.541
{\ blur3.7}Don't...</b>

01:05:32.458 --> 01:05:35.583
{\ blur3.7}Don't move... mother, have some tea...</b>

01:05:38.333 --> 01:05:39.750
{\ blur3.7}Don't move...</b>

01:05:49.125 --> 01:05:52.500
{\ blur3.7}Little Po, bring your wife upstairs.</b>

01:05:56.916 --> 01:05:58.125
{\ blur3.7}And fuck her!</b>

01:06:17.625 --> 01:06:22.833
{\ blur3.7}So you like to play hide-and-seek,
I'll play with you.</b>

01:07:02.583 --> 01:07:03.708
{\ blur3.7}Plumbing fluid!</b>

01:07:45.125 --> 01:07:46.666
{\ blur3.7}What the fuck do you want?</b>

01:07:51.041 --> 01:07:53.000
{\ blur3.7}I need to disinfect you.</b>

01:07:54.250 --> 01:07:56.291
{\ blur3.7}I don't want you to get infected.</b>

01:07:57.041 --> 01:07:59.500
{\ blur3.7}And make my son dirty.</b>

01:08:23.166 --> 01:08:26.332
{\ blur3.7}Son, do it.</b>

01:08:35.125 --> 01:08:37.207
{\ blur3.7}Do you remember how?</b>

01:08:41.332 --> 01:08:46.207
{\ blur3.7}I've taught you many times.</b>

01:08:47.582 --> 01:08:50.207
{\ blur3.7}I forgot...</b>

01:08:55.250 --> 01:08:59.332
{\ blur3.7}Answer me! I'll kill you if you don't!</b>

01:08:59.750 --> 01:09:02.184
{\ blur3.7}You're thirty and you don't know
how to have sex?</b>

01:09:02.207 --> 01:09:04.290
{\ blur3.7}Who's gonna take care of you when I'm dead?</b>

01:09:04.291 --> 01:09:06.041
{\ blur3.7}Who's gonna take care of you!</b>

01:09:06.541 --> 01:09:08.791
{\ blur3.7}Piss...</b>

01:09:12.832 --> 01:09:15.165
{\ blur3.7}Yes, and then?</b>

01:09:15.166 --> 01:09:22.166
{\ blur3.7}The thing I use to pee... put into where
she uses to pee... Then I'll take a piss...</b>

01:09:22.332 --> 01:09:25.832
{\ blur3.7}Okay, good boy, good boy.</b>

01:09:29.707 --> 01:09:35.166
{\ blur3.7}Yes, just remember.</b>

01:09:36.541 --> 01:09:37.916
{\ blur3.7}Are you okay?</b>

01:09:38.082 --> 01:09:39.125
{\ blur3.7}I'm okay.</b>

01:09:42.166 --> 01:09:44.832
{\ blur3.7}Just helping you out, calm down.</b>

01:09:45.125 --> 01:09:46.375
{\ blur3.7}It hurts.</b>

01:09:47.125 --> 01:09:48.665
{\ blur3.7}Why would my husband like someone</b>

01:09:48.666 --> 01:09:50.375
{\ blur3.7}with an attitude like that?</b>

01:09:50.625 --> 01:09:52.582
{\ blur3.7}He liked me for two reasons.</b>

01:09:52.707 --> 01:09:53.957
{\ blur3.7}One, I'm better than you.</b>

01:09:53.957 --> 01:09:55.250
{\ blur3.7}Two, you're not as good as me.</b>

01:09:56.041 --> 01:09:57.915
{\ blur3.7}If you were better than me,</b>

01:09:57.916 --> 01:09:59.875
{\ blur3.7}then my husband would've
divorced me long ago.</b>

01:10:00.208 --> 01:10:02.976
{\ blur3.7}Well at least I'd talk to your husband
when it's 'hot as fuck'</b>

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.915
{\ blur3.7}That's the only reason
he'd have sex with you.</b>

01:10:04.916 --> 01:10:06.582
{\ blur3.7}He'd have sex with me
even if we don't talk.</b>

01:10:06.583 --> 01:10:07.749
{\ blur3.7}Which means I'm better.</b>

01:10:07.750 --> 01:10:10.249
{\ blur3.7}That's right, you only have one position.</b>

01:10:10.250 --> 01:10:12.082
{\ blur3.7}"David, it's all good,
why are we changing positions?"</b>

01:10:12.083 --> 01:10:13.999
{\ blur3.7}I'm right, why change positions
when it's all good?</b>

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.916
{\ blur3.7}Will you suddenly change your seat
when taking a bus?</b>

01:10:16.250 --> 01:10:18.125
{\ blur3.7}Don't touch me, this is serious business.</b>

01:10:24.958 --> 01:10:26.125
{\ blur3.7}He's not dead yet...</b>

01:10:53.166 --> 01:10:55.166
{\ blur3.7}Men deserve to die.</b>

01:10:59.791 --> 01:11:02.458
{\ blur3.7}Don't come near me!</b>

01:11:02.625 --> 01:11:04.541
{\ blur3.7}Is that the 'westerner' yelling?</b>

01:11:05.750 --> 01:11:06.976
{\ blur3.7}How do you know she's a westerner?</b>

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:08.333
{\ blur3.7}Stay the fuck away!</b>

01:11:08.791 --> 01:11:11.333
{\ blur3.7}She's speaking English,
she's gotta be a westerner.</b>

01:11:12.250 --> 01:11:15.351
{\ blur3.7}Go away!
Just put where you piss...</b>

01:11:15.375 --> 01:11:18.309
{\ blur3.7}Get the fuck away from me!
Into where she takes a piss...</b>

01:11:18.333 --> 01:11:19.833
{\ blur3.7}Hello!</b>

01:11:24.125 --> 01:11:25.166
{\ blur3.7}Where's my son?</b>

01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:26.541
{\ blur3.7}Your son?</b>

01:11:27.208 --> 01:11:29.666
{\ blur3.7}He's dead.
He's dead...</b>

01:11:31.666 --> 01:11:33.375
{\ blur3.7}Bitch.</b>

01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:37.125
{\ blur3.7}Why say that about yourself?</b>

01:11:40.250 --> 01:11:42.083
{\ blur3.7}There are two guns here.</b>

01:11:42.916 --> 01:11:46.916
{\ blur3.7}One in my hand,
and another in my son's pants.</b>

01:11:48.625 --> 01:11:50.750
{\ blur3.7}Which one do you think is
gonna shoot first?</b>

01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:14.458
{\ blur3.7}Did the fucker wear a condom
when you guys had sex?</b>

01:12:16.750 --> 01:12:19.625
{\ blur3.7}Your boyfriend... did he wear a condom?
No.</b>

01:12:25.625 --> 01:12:27.708
{\ blur3.7}Sorry, what about you?</b>

01:12:28.250 --> 01:12:30.250
{\ blur3.7}I'm his wife, of course he didn't.</b>

01:12:31.583 --> 01:12:32.916
{\ blur3.7}That makes sense.</b>

01:12:34.958 --> 01:12:37.791
{\ blur3.7}I was married to him for ten years,
we wanted kids.</b>

01:12:38.583 --> 01:12:42.083
{\ blur3.7}But we couldn't get
pregnant, not even once.</b>

01:12:46.666 --> 01:12:48.207
{\ blur3.7}What are you thinking?</b>

01:12:48.208 --> 01:12:49.958
{\ blur3.7}If a tens of millions
of sperm can't hit me.</b>

01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:52.291
{\ blur3.7}I don't think a few bullets will hit me.</b>

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.726
{\ blur3.7}Calm down.
Three...</b>

01:13:00.750 --> 01:13:04.124
{\ blur3.7}Think about this!
Two...</b>

01:13:04.125 --> 01:13:07.250
{\ blur3.7}Come on! We need to prepare!
One...</b>

01:13:14.666 --> 01:13:16.625
{\ blur3.7}I was really scared
when I first became an assassin.</b>

01:13:16.958 --> 01:13:19.500
{\ blur3.7}My mentor asked me
if I wanted to have kids</b>

01:13:19.625 --> 01:13:23.625
{\ blur3.7}I said, of course,
every woman wants to be a mother.</b>

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.476
{\ blur3.7}And then he said to me.</b>

01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:29.332
{\ blur3.7}The pain level of a bullet wound is 8,
but childbirth is 10.</b>

01:13:29.333 --> 01:13:32.333
{\ blur3.7}Us women aren't even scared to have kids.</b>

01:13:32.458 --> 01:13:34.458
{\ blur3.7}Why would I be scared of getting shot?</b>

01:13:38.458 --> 01:13:40.332
{\ blur3.7}I've read in 'Sisters' magazine once.</b>

01:13:40.333 --> 01:13:42.707
{\ blur3.7}That every woman is like red wine.</b>

01:13:42.708 --> 01:13:45.666
{\ blur3.7}Spending her whole life looking for
the right cork.</b>

01:13:46.125 --> 01:13:48.851
{\ blur3.7}I thought I found mine,
but I found out that.</b>

01:13:48.875 --> 01:13:50.457
{\ blur3.7}The wine cork</b>

01:13:50.458 --> 01:13:52.916
{\ blur3.7}didn't just belong to me</b>

01:13:53.083 --> 01:13:54.833
{\ blur3.7}I've been mad at the other red wines.</b>

01:13:55.166 --> 01:13:58.458
{\ blur3.7}But I realized that,
it's not the red wines' fault.</b>

01:13:58.708 --> 01:14:01.125
{\ blur3.7}It's the cork that has been fucking us all.</b>

01:14:12.375 --> 01:14:13.083
{\ blur3.7}Shit.</b>

01:14:45.791 --> 01:14:49.666
{\ blur3.7}You normally don't let me do this, mother.</b>

01:14:51.416 --> 01:14:53.208
{\ blur3.7}Get up!</b>

01:14:58.416 --> 01:15:04.101
{\ blur3.7}I'm hungry,
get up and cook something for me!</b>

01:15:04.125 --> 01:15:08.517
{\ blur3.7}Mother, don't waste the grape juice,
I wanna drink it.</b>

01:15:08.541 --> 01:15:13.958
{\ blur3.7}Mother, get up... get up now</b>

01:15:14.458 --> 01:15:21.458
{\ blur3.7}I'm hungry... make me some food</b>

01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:29.666
{\ blur3.7}9 out of 10 guys are assholes.</b>

01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:32.041
{\ blur3.7}The one left behind is an idiot.</b>

01:15:34.166 --> 01:15:36.083
{\ blur3.7}Mother...</b>

01:15:54.916 --> 01:15:58.208
{\ blur3.7}Can you get up, mistress?</b>

01:16:04.833 --> 01:16:07.291
{\ blur3.7}Hey, help us out.</b>

01:16:11.291 --> 01:16:13.625
{\ blur3.7}Two mistresses.</b>

01:17:23.125 --> 01:17:25.583
{\ blur3.7}Will you look for David?</b>

01:17:27.250 --> 01:17:30.333
{\ blur3.7}My time isn't for wasting.</b>

01:17:32.958 --> 01:17:35.125
{\ blur3.7}You're looking for David?</b>

01:17:36.166 --> 01:17:38.875
{\ blur3.7}No way, I'm already looking for other guys.</b>

01:17:42.291 --> 01:17:45.375
{\ blur3.7}What about you? It's more tricky for you.</b>

01:17:47.458 --> 01:17:49.124
{\ blur3.7}Why?</b>

01:17:49.125 --> 01:17:52.166
{\ blur3.7}Marriage and divorce are both
a sheet of paper.</b>

01:17:52.541 --> 01:17:56.416
{\ blur3.7}One is signed together,
the other signed apart.</b>

01:18:03.291 --> 01:18:04.457
{\ blur3.7}Where are you headed?</b>

01:18:04.458 --> 01:18:07.916
{\ blur3.7}To the city.
It's on the way, I'll drop you off.</b>

01:18:08.333 --> 01:18:10.041
{\ blur3.7}I don't want to be on the same way as you.</b>

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:12.750
{\ blur3.7}Let's go our separate ways.</b>

01:18:57.708 --> 01:19:00.958
{\ blur3.7}THREE YEARS LATER</b>

01:19:26.958 --> 01:19:29.041
{\ blur3.7}How can I help you, madam?</b>

01:19:29.208 --> 01:19:32.017
{\ blur3.7}Do you have a customer here
called Michelle Lee?</b>

01:19:32.041 --> 01:19:34.142
{\ blur3.7}Sorry, we cannot divulge client details.</b>

01:19:34.166 --> 01:19:36.166
{\ blur3.7}Maybe I'll let my manager speak with you?</b>

01:19:41.333 --> 01:19:43.374
{\ blur3.7}Ma'am, there's a police officer
asking for information.</b>

01:19:43.375 --> 01:19:44.375
{\ blur3.7}Okay.</b>

01:19:49.208 --> 01:19:50.892
{\ blur3.7}What is wrong with society nowadays?</b>

01:19:50.916 --> 01:19:53.208
{\ blur3.7}An assassin can become a cop?</b>

01:19:59.875 --> 01:20:02.791
{\ blur3.7}I have a delivery from
the Virginia Company.</b>

01:20:03.291 --> 01:20:07.541
{\ blur3.7}The package is for Miss Michelle Lee?</b>

01:20:13.541 --> 01:20:16.375
{\ blur3.7}What? Your boyfriend proposed?</b>

01:20:17.083 --> 01:20:18.750
{\ blur3.7}How did he propose to you?</b>

01:20:19.125 --> 01:20:23.101
{\ blur3.7}He booked the presidential suite
at the Mr. Cowden.</b>

01:20:23.125 --> 01:20:25.476
{\ blur3.7}The most expensive hotel?</b>

01:20:25.500 --> 01:20:27.791
{\ blur3.7}Shut up, let her speak.</b>

01:20:27.916 --> 01:20:30.958
{\ blur3.7}We had dinner together,
had a little bit of wine.</b>

01:20:31.083 --> 01:20:32.958
{\ blur3.7}And then...</b>

01:20:36.750 --> 01:20:41.125
{\ blur3.7}We were in bed,
and then came the most important part.</b>

01:20:41.666 --> 01:20:43.250
{\ blur3.7}I took off his pants.</b>

01:20:43.750 --> 01:20:45.666
{\ blur3.7}Guess where he put the ring?</b>

01:20:52.625 --> 01:20:53.541
{\ blur3.7}Exactly!</b>

01:20:54.125 --> 01:20:55.915
{\ blur3.7}And then he asked if I would marry him.</b>

01:20:55.916 --> 01:20:57.583
{\ blur3.7}If I did...</b>

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.250
{\ blur3.7}Then I would retrieve the ring
with my mouth.</b>

01:21:03.083 --> 01:21:04.333
{\ blur3.7}Did you get it then?</b>

01:21:14.083 --> 01:21:17.291
{\ blur3.7}How was it placed?</b>

01:21:18.041 --> 01:21:19.916
{\ blur3.7}There was a silk bow.</b>

01:21:20.416 --> 01:21:22.500
{\ blur3.7}What about you?</b>

01:21:22.791 --> 01:21:25.125
{\ blur3.7}I'm married, and I have kids.</b>

01:21:25.833 --> 01:21:27.208
{\ blur3.7}Boy or girl?</b>

01:21:27.333 --> 01:21:29.833
{\ blur3.7}Boy and girl, I've got twins.</b>

01:21:30.166 --> 01:21:32.434
{\ blur3.7}Feeding them must be expensive!</b>

01:21:32.458 --> 01:21:35.000
{\ blur3.7}Not really, I breast feed them.</b>

01:21:35.875 --> 01:21:42.000
{\ blur3.7}People say breastfeeding will turn your
pink lady into a black woman.</b>

01:21:42.500 --> 01:21:43.226
{\ blur3.7}Let's see... let's see...</b>

01:21:43.250 --> 01:21:47.892
{\ blur3.7}Come on! It's not that black.</b>

01:21:47.916 --> 01:21:50.833
{\ blur3.7}But... it has gotten a little bigger...</b>

01:21:51.291 --> 01:21:53.017
{\ blur3.7}Your 'sauce plates'?</b>

01:21:53.041 --> 01:21:54.957
{\ blur3.7}Pot lids?</b>

01:21:54.958 --> 01:21:59.000
{\ blur3.7}Go to hell!
You guys will be like this some day too...</b>

01:21:59.291 --> 01:22:01.351
{\ blur3.7}But my husband says that.</b>

01:22:01.375 --> 01:22:05.416
{\ blur3.7}This is a place to feed our kids,
so she doesn't want to play with me...</b>

01:22:05.958 --> 01:22:08.351
{\ blur3.7}What kind of man wants to suck
on a pot lid?</b>

01:22:08.375 --> 01:22:12.375
{\ blur3.7}Hey, let me clarify, it is not a pot lid.</b>

01:22:14.666 --> 01:22:16.291
{\ blur3.7}It is... a lid for a cup.</b>

01:22:19.166 --> 01:22:21.059
{\ blur3.7}Stop teasing, Oreo...</b>

01:22:21.083 --> 01:22:22.875
{\ blur3.7}Who is Oreo?</b>

01:22:26.083 --> 01:22:28.892
{\ blur3.7}So you're Oreo, and this one...</b>

01:22:28.916 --> 01:22:30.000
{\ blur3.7}Stop it...</b>

01:22:42.208 --> 01:22:44.101
{\ blur3.7}What about you? You
didn't say anything yet.</b>

01:22:44.125 --> 01:22:45.874
{\ blur3.7}It's been troubling recently.</b>

01:22:45.875 --> 01:22:47.226
{\ blur3.7}About what?</b>

01:22:47.250 --> 01:22:49.184
{\ blur3.7}I'm being chased by two guys.</b>

01:22:49.208 --> 01:22:53.101
{\ blur3.7}One's a rich guy, and one's really talented</b>

01:22:53.125 --> 01:22:55.059
{\ blur3.7}I don't know which one to choose.</b>

01:22:55.083 --> 01:22:56.666
{\ blur3.7}Why not both?</b>

01:22:56.958 --> 01:22:59.500
{\ blur3.7}Both? Really? For sure?</b>

01:22:59.916 --> 01:23:01.249
{\ blur3.7}Have you ever been in a shop</b>

01:23:01.250 --> 01:23:02.582
{\ blur3.7}and you have your eyes on two bags...</b>

01:23:02.583 --> 01:23:03.707
{\ blur3.7}Which one will you choose?</b>

01:23:03.708 --> 01:23:04.666
{\ blur3.7}You'll get both of them!</b>

01:23:05.791 --> 01:23:08.541
{\ blur3.7}That's the point!
It's that simple...</b>

01:23:22.541 --> 01:23:26.208
{\ blur3.7}Didn't you say you were gonna settle
the score three years ago?</b>

01:23:27.333 --> 01:23:30.165
{\ blur3.7}I couldn't find him three years ago,</b>

01:23:30.166 --> 01:23:33.208
{\ blur3.7}but I'm settling it today!</b>

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.309
{\ blur3.7}Don't just look, it's just like shopping.</b>

01:23:37.333 --> 01:23:40.000
{\ blur3.7}Too bad if it's out of stock,
but if it's in stock...</b>

01:23:41.041 --> 01:23:42.309
{\ blur3.7}What about you?</b>

01:23:42.333 --> 01:23:45.458
{\ blur3.7}I said we'd divorce,
I didn't say I wouldn't kill him.</b>

01:23:47.083 --> 01:23:47.750
{\ blur3.7}It's time!</b>

01:23:57.958 --> 01:23:59.750
{\ blur3.7}Michelle Lee?
Yes?</b>

01:24:19.125 --> 01:24:22.708
{\ blur3.7}After you get married,
you'll stay with your husband.</b>

01:24:22.875 --> 01:24:25.832
{\ blur3.7}For better or for worse,</b>

01:24:25.833 --> 01:24:26.791
{\ blur3.7}correct?</b>

01:24:31.125 --> 01:24:34.291
{\ blur3.7}Congratulations, because you're
about to encounter the worst.</b>

01:24:35.041 --> 01:24:36.666
{\ blur3.7}We're not married yet.</b>

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:37.708
{\ blur3.7}So?</b>

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.291
{\ blur3.7}Please let us go.</b>

01:24:39.708 --> 01:24:41.375
{\ blur3.7}It's up to you.</b>

01:24:41.791 --> 01:24:43.291
{\ blur3.7}Thank you... thank you...</b>

01:24:44.291 --> 01:24:48.041
{\ blur3.7}Hey, when did your fiance propose to you?</b>

01:24:50.708 --> 01:24:53.708
{\ blur3.7}Don't be scared, I'm just asking.</b>

01:24:55.416 --> 01:24:57.416
{\ blur3.7}Three years ago...</b>

01:24:59.833 --> 01:25:03.583
{\ blur3.7}There are 365 days in a year,
did he propose every single day?</b>

01:25:06.541 --> 01:25:07.833
{\ blur3.7}It was my birthday.</b>

01:25:09.083 --> 01:25:13.666
{\ blur3.7}That day was the day we almost died
in that hotel.</b>

01:25:14.333 --> 01:25:17.750
{\ blur3.7}That bastard proposed to you on
that exact day.</b>

01:25:19.208 --> 01:25:22.832
{\ blur3.7}Don't come near me!
My Dad is a powerful man!</b>

01:25:22.833 --> 01:25:25.392
{\ blur3.7}I don't need to bring my luggage
to the airport</b>

01:25:25.416 --> 01:25:28.166
{\ blur3.7}I'm allowed to slap my Mom when I'm drunk.</b>

01:25:28.708 --> 01:25:30.208
{\ blur3.7}Were you the one who put the hit on us?</b>

01:25:30.416 --> 01:25:34.375
{\ blur3.7}Yes, it was me, so what?</b>

01:25:34.541 --> 01:25:39.125
{\ blur3.7}Whoever messes with my boy toy
needs to die!</b>

01:25:40.125 --> 01:25:45.208
{\ blur3.7}Bitch! I'd be married if it weren't
for you!</b>

01:25:46.083 --> 01:25:50.083
{\ blur3.7}I'm lucky that my man trusts me
and listens to me.</b>

01:25:51.208 --> 01:25:53.166
{\ blur3.7}What do you have against me?</b>

01:25:53.375 --> 01:25:56.083
{\ blur3.7}One's a mistress, one's infertile,
and another is a slut.</b>

01:26:01.208 --> 01:26:02.666
{\ blur3.7}Eat shit!</b>

01:26:07.958 --> 01:26:09.083
{\ blur3.7}Is she dead?</b>

01:26:09.291 --> 01:26:10.707
{\ blur3.7}You scared her to death</b>

01:26:10.708 --> 01:26:12.916
{\ blur3.7}I wanted to hear her out.</b>

01:26:15.250 --> 01:26:17.915
{\ blur3.7}Go eat shit!</b>

01:26:17.916 --> 01:26:19.583
{\ blur3.7}Sorry.</b>

01:26:36.416 --> 01:26:37.958
{\ blur3.7}You're the asshole, huh?</b>

01:26:39.208 --> 01:26:41.708
{\ blur3.7}<font color="#ff00ff">(UNKNOWN WORDS)</font></b>

01:26:42.041 --> 01:26:43.582
{\ blur3.7}What are you saying?</b>

01:26:43.583 --> 01:26:45.958
{\ blur3.7}Long time no see.</b>

01:27:18.458 --> 01:27:19.583
{\ blur3.7}I'll go first.</b>

01:27:21.375 --> 01:27:22.375
{\ blur3.7}Alright.</b>

01:27:29.291 --> 01:27:33.333
{\ blur3.7}I found out you had a wife
after being together for three years.</b>

01:27:35.125 --> 01:27:38.166
{\ blur3.7}And that you had a girlfriend
after five years.</b>

01:27:39.958 --> 01:27:44.208
{\ blur3.7}You know that I loved you,
why did you wanna break up with me?</b>

01:27:44.541 --> 01:27:46.166
{\ blur3.7}Don't you think you deserve this?</b>

01:27:48.208 --> 01:27:51.333
{\ blur3.7}Say you're sorry, and I'll forgive you.</b>

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:03.125
{\ blur3.7}You don't wanna say it?</b>

01:28:06.125 --> 01:28:07.291
{\ blur3.7}So you can't say it then.</b>

01:28:12.416 --> 01:28:14.707
{\ blur3.7}I hate people...</b>

01:28:14.708 --> 01:28:16.791
{\ blur3.7}Who are disloyal.</b>

01:28:30.208 --> 01:28:32.875
{\ blur3.7}Take over!
Okay, thank you.</b>

01:28:48.666 --> 01:28:53.000
{\ blur3.7}A couple of years ago,
I saw a dress that I really liked.</b>

01:28:53.375 --> 01:28:56.500
{\ blur3.7}But the cashier told me that it
was out of stock.</b>

01:28:57.041 --> 01:29:00.041
{\ blur3.7}So I decided to wait,
which ended up to be ten years.</b>

01:29:00.583 --> 01:29:04.583
{\ blur3.7}In these ten years,
I didn't even look at other dresses.</b>

01:29:04.875 --> 01:29:07.583
{\ blur3.7}Guess what kind of dress I had my eyes on.</b>

01:29:10.833 --> 01:29:11.958
{\ blur3.7}A wedding dress?</b>

01:29:13.875 --> 01:29:16.916
{\ blur3.7}Wedding dress?
I've tried it on, it's unlucky.</b>

01:29:17.333 --> 01:29:18.416
{\ blur3.7}At least you've worn it once.</b>

01:29:24.083 --> 01:29:28.708
{\ blur3.7}But I found out that the dress
was never in stock.</b>

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:32.458
{\ blur3.7}You lied to me.</b>

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:36.059
{\ blur3.7}You've stolen ten years of my youth</b>

01:29:36.083 --> 01:29:38.976
{\ blur3.7}I feel like a spinster who's been trapped
inside a haunted house for a decade</b>

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:42.750
{\ blur3.7}I suffered a lot of emotional trauma.</b>

01:29:42.916 --> 01:29:46.957
{\ blur3.7}It's really difficult trying to forget the
trauma while being in my new house.</b>

01:29:46.958 --> 01:29:49.625
{\ blur3.7}See how shitty you've made the new house?</b>

01:29:53.791 --> 01:29:57.375
{\ blur3.7}You're the haunted house,
and my boyfriend is the new house.</b>

01:29:57.500 --> 01:29:59.541
{\ blur3.7}See how shitty you've made him feel?</b>

01:30:00.708 --> 01:30:04.333
{\ blur3.7}He's really good to me,
should I do something for him?</b>

01:30:13.375 --> 01:30:20.333
{\ blur3.7}Oh sorry, stop yelling,
I've saved up my energy.</b>

01:30:23.041 --> 01:30:27.041
{\ blur3.7}Forget it, I hate men who are disloyal.</b>

01:30:28.500 --> 01:30:31.416
{\ blur3.7}You're done?
Your turn.</b>

01:30:42.416 --> 01:30:45.750
{\ blur3.7}It's 'hot as fuck' today,
why don't we have a chat?</b>

01:30:46.083 --> 01:30:47.166
{\ blur3.7}You'd like that, won't you?</b>

01:30:50.833 --> 01:30:52.666
{\ blur3.7}You're not saying anything?</b>

01:30:53.500 --> 01:30:55.416
{\ blur3.7}Really, nothing?</b>

01:30:56.500 --> 01:30:58.416
{\ blur3.7}Then I'll start talking.</b>

01:31:00.958 --> 01:31:05.416
{\ blur3.7}Do you know why men should
never lie to women?</b>

01:31:06.375 --> 01:31:11.125
{\ blur3.7}Because even if you lie accidentally.</b>

01:31:13.208 --> 01:31:20.750
{\ blur3.7}You'd have to try your hardest to hide it
from her forever.</b>

01:31:21.541 --> 01:31:30.583
{\ blur3.7}But if she found out the truth.</b>

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:35.916
{\ blur3.7}You'd die a horrible death.</b>

01:31:39.166 --> 01:31:42.458
{\ blur3.7}Men should have integrity.</b>

01:31:48.541 --> 01:31:50.250
{\ blur3.7}Do you have a light?</b>

01:31:50.583 --> 01:31:51.500
{\ blur3.7}I do.</b>

01:32:19.458 --> 01:32:22.249
{\ blur3.7}Hey, if you're a guy watching this film</b>

01:32:22.250 --> 01:32:25.125
{\ blur3.7}I hope you seriously get the
message of this movie.</b>

01:32:25.916 --> 01:32:28.809
{\ blur3.7}Stop talking in English, let me speak.</b>

01:32:28.833 --> 01:32:30.559
{\ blur3.7}Let me tell you, if you offend women.</b>

01:32:30.583 --> 01:32:33.125
{\ blur3.7}We won't let you off easy.</b>

01:32:34.583 --> 01:32:36.499
{\ blur3.7}You're right,
a woman's heart is made of glass.</b>

01:32:36.500 --> 01:32:39.000
{\ blur3.7}If it's broken,
it can't be glued back together.</b>

01:32:45.708 --> 01:32:47.666
{\ blur3.7}It's really cracked.</b>

01:32:49.208 --> 01:32:51.291
{\ blur3.7}I told you we won't let you off easy.</b>

01:32:51.458 --> 01:32:54.332
{\ blur3.7}It's a pretty big explosion.
What do we do now?</b>

01:32:54.333 --> 01:32:55.624
{\ blur3.7}Let's go, nothing more we can do.</b>

01:32:55.625 --> 01:32:56.791
{\ blur3.7}Come on, let's go.</b>

01:32:57.208 --> 01:32:59.291
{\ blur3.7}Aww, it's cracked... goodbye!</b>
