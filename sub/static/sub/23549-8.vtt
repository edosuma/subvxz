00:11.040 --> 00:13.160
[Tripitaka's mother]
I have walked from the North Water.

00:13.880 --> 00:15.600
Our village was invaded.

00:17.360 --> 00:20.480
I have nowhere to go and little hope left.

00:26.880 --> 00:28.080
[sighs]

00:33.880 --> 00:36.600
[Raxion] "She is pure of heart
and brave as the wind.

00:38.040 --> 00:39.400
I entrust her to you.

00:41.320 --> 00:42.760
Please take care of my baby.

00:43.440 --> 00:46.320
She is quiet and never cries."

00:52.520 --> 00:54.160
-I can find them.
-[Davari] Uh...

00:55.200 --> 00:56.240
No.

00:57.240 --> 00:59.520
We all have our talents, Raxion.

01:00.800 --> 01:03.400
There's another more suited to this task.

01:04.160 --> 01:06.040
-Of course.
-Mmm.

01:11.600 --> 01:12.640
[Sandy] Tripitaka.

01:14.240 --> 01:15.760
Gone. Just the letter.

01:17.400 --> 01:18.800
What do you mean, gone?

01:20.320 --> 01:21.320
[grunts]

01:22.080 --> 01:23.840
Gone where, and for how long?

01:23.920 --> 01:24.920
It doesn't say.

01:25.480 --> 01:26.800
Let me read that.

01:30.680 --> 01:32.840
"I can no longer be part of this quest.

01:35.520 --> 01:37.000
I thought this was my destiny.

01:37.880 --> 01:40.640
I felt it like an arrow
bursting from my chest.

01:40.720 --> 01:43.280
-And now that arrow is blunt."
-[sighing]

01:43.360 --> 01:46.040
"There is another road for me
that lies ahead."

01:46.840 --> 01:48.440
It's because of what happened to Gwen.

01:49.120 --> 01:51.280
-I'll go after him.
-Forget about Tripitaka.

01:52.040 --> 01:53.280
Forget about the scrolls.

01:53.360 --> 01:55.320
-Come again?
-[Monkey] You know as well as I do

01:55.400 --> 01:57.520
that whoever stole the first scroll
could have more.

01:58.120 --> 02:00.040
They're already working
on a way to translate them.

02:00.840 --> 02:01.960
We have to stop them.

02:02.040 --> 02:03.520
We have to get to Jade Mountain.

02:03.600 --> 02:05.680
Monkey, they have an army.

02:05.760 --> 02:10.639
Between the three of us, we have a scythe,
a rake and a contractible pole.

02:10.720 --> 02:12.680
I don't like the tone
you're taking with me right now.

02:12.760 --> 02:13.680
All right.

02:14.400 --> 02:17.000
Settle down. We're all upset,
but let's not lose our heads.

02:17.640 --> 02:18.960
Why don't we do this?

02:19.040 --> 02:20.480
Both of you head towards Jade Mountain

02:20.560 --> 02:22.840
and find out what you can
about who took the scrolls.

02:23.440 --> 02:26.480
I'll follow the monk and see
if I can talk some sense into him.

02:27.360 --> 02:30.120
We'll meet at the outskirts of the palace
in two days' time.

02:30.200 --> 02:32.600
Hopefully, with Tripitaka.

02:37.240 --> 02:38.400
[sighs]

02:53.200 --> 02:54.960
-[chittering]
-[gasps]

02:55.880 --> 02:57.360
[breathing heavily]

03:09.080 --> 03:10.200
Good aim.

03:12.560 --> 03:14.000
Did you read my letter?

03:14.080 --> 03:15.920
Yes, many times.

03:17.360 --> 03:19.200
We all agreed you shouldn't travel alone.

03:20.280 --> 03:21.480
What did Monkey say?

03:22.000 --> 03:25.040
I know you think he doesn't care,
but he was actually rather upset.

03:27.280 --> 03:28.520
I'm heading north.

03:29.160 --> 03:30.960
And I don't want you
to question me about it.

03:31.640 --> 03:33.720
It's like you're by yourself,
but I'm here.

03:34.600 --> 03:35.800
Lead on.

03:35.880 --> 03:37.240
[Monkey] This is good.

03:38.680 --> 03:40.280
We head to the Jade Mountain.

03:40.360 --> 03:43.040
Whatever pus-soaked demon
that has taken over will be there.

03:43.120 --> 03:45.880
We find whoever's in charge,
we find the stolen scrolls.

03:46.720 --> 03:49.160
[Pigsy panting] Are we
going to stop for lunch?

03:49.240 --> 03:50.800
[Monkey] The demons stole
the best years of your life.

03:50.880 --> 03:55.120
Made you less than a god, less than a man,
and you're thinking about your stomach?

03:55.200 --> 03:58.720
No, of course. Payback time. Totally.

03:59.560 --> 04:02.600
I'm just saying, eventually we are
going to have to stop for lunch.

04:03.400 --> 04:05.320
[muttering in the distance]

04:16.720 --> 04:18.079
[static]

04:22.280 --> 04:24.640
[indistinct chatter over earpiece]

04:24.720 --> 04:27.720
[Raxion singing]
♪ Stew, stew, stew, you're so good ♪

04:27.800 --> 04:31.080
♪ You're so yummy, yum
Get in my tummy tum ♪

04:31.160 --> 04:32.640
[sighs heavily]

04:33.720 --> 04:37.400
Look, I know that you don't need food,
but please don't watch me while I eat.

04:48.880 --> 04:51.080
Hey, that's the guy
from the nightmare factory.

04:52.240 --> 04:53.880
Let's annihilate him and his cronies.

04:54.400 --> 04:57.400
And then ride a wave of destruction
all the way to Jade Mountain.

04:57.480 --> 04:59.960
Or we find out
who he's taking orders from,

05:00.040 --> 05:02.680
see how far they've got
with translating the scrolls.

05:02.760 --> 05:04.920
Sure. Press him for information first.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.920
Then ride the wave of destruction.

05:07.680 --> 05:08.880
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

05:08.960 --> 05:10.720
-What? What, what?
-I've got an idea.

05:11.760 --> 05:12.840
You'll love it.

05:32.960 --> 05:34.320
The North Water.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.720
[sighs] I said not to question me
about it.

05:36.800 --> 05:39.440
Just making sure we have the right place.

05:43.320 --> 05:46.480
[Tripitaka] I'm looking for my family.
I was born here.

05:46.560 --> 05:48.400
I'm so sorry to hear that.

05:51.080 --> 05:53.560
-Do you want me to ask around?
-No, I don't.

05:53.640 --> 05:55.680
Just stay back.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.400
A bag of those, please.

06:06.160 --> 06:10.360
I'm looking for a woman.
I don't know her name,

06:10.440 --> 06:15.400
but she had a baby that she had
to give away 16, 17 years ago?

06:19.920 --> 06:22.920
Excuse me, I'm trying to find my family.

06:29.560 --> 06:32.120
I am not an expert in social interaction,

06:32.720 --> 06:37.640
but I'm guessing you might have to try
to take a different approach.

06:45.880 --> 06:47.840
I have walked from the North Water.

06:48.800 --> 06:50.400
Our village was invaded.

06:51.080 --> 06:53.400
I have nowhere to go and little hope left.

06:57.320 --> 06:58.360
She is pure of heart...

06:59.600 --> 07:00.920
and brave as the wind.

07:01.600 --> 07:02.840
I entrust her to you.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.080
Please look after my baby daughter.

07:06.680 --> 07:08.440
She is quiet and never cries.

07:10.800 --> 07:13.600
[clears throat] I have walked
from the North Water.

07:14.800 --> 07:16.440
Our village was invaded.

07:17.760 --> 07:20.800
I have nowhere to go and little hope left.

07:26.240 --> 07:27.240
[sighs]

07:30.320 --> 07:33.280
Mmm, the tethered goat. Genius.

07:33.800 --> 07:36.760
Now, when the demons get here,
I'll launch a surprise attack,

07:36.840 --> 07:39.480
cut you loose, and together
we'll expunge them from our world.

07:39.560 --> 07:40.960
You've really come a long way.

07:41.040 --> 07:42.760
Thank you. That means a lot to me.

07:42.840 --> 07:43.760
Now hide.

08:17.440 --> 08:20.080
To be honest, I did wonder.
You were kind of an unusual boy.

08:21.040 --> 08:22.240
I'm not a monk, either.

08:23.120 --> 08:25.400
The real Tripitaka was killed by a demon.

08:25.960 --> 08:28.560
I was just doing whatever I could
to stop Monkey from leaving.

08:29.400 --> 08:31.360
Okay, but it did work, yes?

08:31.440 --> 08:32.880
You found a way to control Monkey,

08:32.960 --> 08:35.360
and you convinced him
to join the Resistance.

08:35.440 --> 08:38.520
You're doing everything this
Tripitaka person was supposed to do.

08:38.600 --> 08:41.840
Gwen said to me before she died
that I had to make a choice

08:41.919 --> 08:43.559
or I would put lives at risk.

08:43.640 --> 08:45.920
She said that the girl
in my mother's letter

08:46.000 --> 08:47.640
couldn't be the one that journeys west.

08:47.720 --> 08:50.080
You think it's a coincidence
that your mother, whoever she is,

08:50.160 --> 08:53.280
just happened to leave you
at the scholar's doorstep?

08:53.360 --> 08:56.560
The keeper of the crown? One of
the leading figures of the Resistance?

08:58.200 --> 08:59.880
[girls laughing]

09:05.440 --> 09:06.280
[Tripitaka] Hello.

09:07.160 --> 09:11.600
Did you see a woman pass by?
Dark hair, maybe this tall?

09:13.000 --> 09:14.640
-Mother?
-Mother?

09:24.760 --> 09:26.160
Do you know who I am?

09:27.320 --> 09:28.320
Go inside.

09:31.720 --> 09:33.240
Are those your daughters?

09:35.880 --> 09:37.040
Your sisters.

09:51.560 --> 09:53.200
[Monkey grunting]

09:54.600 --> 09:56.440
Well, well, well...

09:58.840 --> 10:00.400
Hey, Monkey King.

10:02.080 --> 10:03.520
Where are your buds, hmm?

10:04.720 --> 10:05.720
[gasps]

10:07.200 --> 10:08.360
[breathing heavily]

10:15.000 --> 10:18.120
Looks like the universe is at long last
delivering me some luck.

10:21.120 --> 10:23.400
[blows]

10:24.680 --> 10:27.560
[groaning]

10:30.920 --> 10:31.960
[grunts]

10:34.280 --> 10:35.480
[groans]

10:40.240 --> 10:43.720
This is my friend, Sandy. She's a god.

10:44.480 --> 10:48.240
I'm Meera. My daughters
are Ilbryn and Brylana.

10:48.320 --> 10:49.600
That's a mouthful.

10:50.520 --> 10:51.760
And what was your name?

10:52.360 --> 10:54.240
Oh, I'm so sorry.

10:55.000 --> 10:55.960
[Tripitaka] It's okay.

10:57.200 --> 10:59.280
Sandy doesn't know her own strength.

10:59.360 --> 11:00.880
I know how to hold a teapot.

11:02.520 --> 11:04.080
Please, sit.

11:09.200 --> 11:11.640
You want to know
why I never came back for you.

11:13.680 --> 11:16.560
I thought about coming back many times.

11:17.240 --> 11:20.200
But I was sure that the life you had
would be better than this.

11:20.880 --> 11:22.800
The scholar took good care of me.

11:24.280 --> 11:25.560
You made a good choice.

11:28.640 --> 11:30.920
If life was so terrible here,
why did you come back?

11:31.000 --> 11:35.320
After we fled the raids,
our plan was to head to the Gandara Sea.

11:35.880 --> 11:38.440
But my mother, your grandmother,
became ill.

11:39.840 --> 11:43.440
She wanted to return to the place
where she was born before she died.

11:43.520 --> 11:45.520
Perhaps after tea,
we could go and visit the grave.

11:45.600 --> 11:46.840
Sandy.

11:47.600 --> 11:49.680
How about you go and watch the children?

11:58.080 --> 11:59.120
[both girls laughing]

11:59.880 --> 12:03.680
Have you ever been to the Gandara Sea?
We're going there soon.

12:04.240 --> 12:07.040
They say the water is clear
and the fish are silver.

12:07.120 --> 12:09.400
And you can catch more than you can eat.

12:10.160 --> 12:13.320
I haven't been... but I bet you're right.

12:15.080 --> 12:16.800
Do you know any games?

12:19.160 --> 12:21.120
I do know a fun game.

12:21.680 --> 12:26.760
It's a game where I ask you a question,
and you have to tell me the truth.

12:28.360 --> 12:31.600
How long have you lived here?
In the North Water?

12:31.680 --> 12:33.720
-Not long.
-Shh!

12:34.720 --> 12:37.960
[Ilbryn] She means not long
because she's only little.

12:38.040 --> 12:40.600
But we've lived here a very long time.

12:44.320 --> 12:45.320
Mmm.

12:46.160 --> 12:48.600
[Meera] I know how hard
this must have been for you.

12:48.680 --> 12:49.800
This isn't much of a home.

12:51.080 --> 12:54.400
But if you were willing to come with us,

12:54.960 --> 12:56.960
and to travel to the Gandara Sea, well...

12:57.720 --> 13:00.920
maybe there we could make a home.
For all of us.

13:13.320 --> 13:14.440
Thanks.

13:38.160 --> 13:41.840
[Raxion] Ever since you showed up,
I've suffered a cut in wages,

13:41.920 --> 13:44.840
a subsequent loss of status.

13:44.920 --> 13:47.200
Your presence has left
a permanent mark against me.

13:49.160 --> 13:51.120
How's the stew? Hmm?

13:55.040 --> 13:58.680
On the positive side,
the boss has a major beef with you.

13:59.320 --> 14:03.560
You're public enemy number one,
Monkey King. [chuckles]

14:03.640 --> 14:07.080
Last I heard, he was throwing
everything into your capture.

14:07.160 --> 14:10.120
Now you're here, under my capture.

14:10.880 --> 14:14.200
So maybe it's all coming together for me,
eh, boys? [laughs]

14:16.360 --> 14:17.680
[gasps]

14:17.760 --> 14:18.760
What took you so long?

14:19.800 --> 14:20.840
Long story.

14:20.920 --> 14:24.800
Okay, demon, time to put an end
to your centuries of boring patter.

14:24.880 --> 14:26.160
Wait a second. Just wait.

14:26.760 --> 14:29.120
If you kill me,
you'll never get into Jade Mountain.

14:30.280 --> 14:31.840
How do you know
we're going to Jade Mountain?

14:31.920 --> 14:33.920
You want to find out
who's behind all this?

14:34.000 --> 14:35.440
The one with the sacred scroll?

14:35.520 --> 14:37.240
He's the one you want
to stick a knife into.

14:37.320 --> 14:38.880
I could help you get close to him.

14:39.520 --> 14:41.400
And why would you do that, exactly?

14:41.480 --> 14:43.360
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

14:44.480 --> 14:48.440
So we hate him, you hate him,
but we also hate each other.

14:48.520 --> 14:50.680
So we join our hate and work together.

14:51.960 --> 14:54.160
They really don't make gods
the way they used to, do they?

14:54.240 --> 14:55.240
Mmm.

14:55.320 --> 14:56.840
[girls laughing]

15:09.560 --> 15:10.880
[Sandy] I'm curious.

15:11.520 --> 15:14.720
How does a mother all on her own
make a living in a place like this?

15:15.720 --> 15:17.480
Uh, we fish.

15:17.560 --> 15:18.560
You fish?

15:19.720 --> 15:20.640
In that?

15:21.440 --> 15:23.000
Know anything about fishing?

15:23.800 --> 15:27.360
Enough to know
that there's no fish in that river.

15:27.440 --> 15:29.600
-[Tripitaka] Sandy.
-Are these really your daughters?

15:29.680 --> 15:31.000
Sandy, that's enough.

15:33.800 --> 15:36.160
Is that one of your powers?
Detecting fish?

15:37.360 --> 15:38.360
One of them.

15:39.600 --> 15:42.920
I'll tell you something I've become
particularly good at over the years...

15:43.600 --> 15:46.680
and that's knowing
when someone is hiding something.

15:47.560 --> 15:48.800
[Tripitaka] Sandy, stop it.

15:48.880 --> 15:50.240
You're scaring them.

15:51.640 --> 15:53.040
Could I talk to you in private?

15:54.320 --> 15:56.320
[thunder rumbling]

16:00.560 --> 16:02.240
Sandy, you have to let me go.

16:02.320 --> 16:03.440
She's lying to you.

16:03.520 --> 16:04.840
You don't know that.

16:04.920 --> 16:06.680
I'm going to drain
this foul-smelling swamp,

16:06.760 --> 16:09.560
and then you'll see that there's
nothing here but a pile of rotting bones.

16:11.800 --> 16:12.800
Don't.

16:13.640 --> 16:14.960
Sandy, stop!

16:17.480 --> 16:18.880
Why are you doing this?

16:20.440 --> 16:22.600
This is all I have left.

16:22.680 --> 16:24.120
All you have left?

16:24.800 --> 16:27.360
What about us? What about the quest?

16:27.440 --> 16:29.760
-She's my mother.
-How do you know that?

16:32.400 --> 16:34.520
I just do. I... I can feel it.

16:34.600 --> 16:37.040
And say she is your mother.
You know nothing about her.

16:37.120 --> 16:38.920
All you know is that,
when things became difficult,

16:39.000 --> 16:41.360
she discarded you like an unwanted rag.

16:41.440 --> 16:42.480
That's not true.

16:42.560 --> 16:44.400
Don't be betrayed by your own emotions.

16:44.480 --> 16:46.000
Tripitaka, you are smarter than that.

16:46.080 --> 16:48.040
My name is not Tripitaka!

16:49.320 --> 16:53.080
[sniffles] You wouldn't understand
what it's like to lose a family.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.320
To always feel
like a part of you is missing.

16:59.200 --> 17:01.280
I wasn't born in a sewer, you know.

17:04.800 --> 17:06.920
Since we're being
so honest with each other,

17:07.720 --> 17:09.280
I'll let you in on something.

17:10.440 --> 17:12.200
I didn't choose to live like this.

17:13.040 --> 17:14.400
I grew up in a fishing village.

17:15.560 --> 17:18.000
One day, when I was not
much older than those girls,

17:18.680 --> 17:21.880
my father took me out onto the boat,
into rough seas.

17:21.960 --> 17:24.400
I was trying to drop the anchor
when I fell into the water.

17:25.319 --> 17:26.760
But, to my surprise, I didn't drown.

17:26.839 --> 17:29.800
In fact, I found the stillness of the sea
rather comforting.

17:30.880 --> 17:32.680
That was the beginning
of my transformation.

17:32.760 --> 17:37.320
I started to hear the cries of
the creatures that we caught in our nets.

17:38.360 --> 17:41.680
All day and into the night,
I heard them scream.

17:42.960 --> 17:44.560
Until, one day,
I couldn't bear it any longer.

17:44.640 --> 17:46.200
I decided to cut them loose.

17:48.400 --> 17:51.600
It wasn't long before
my family found out. [sighs]

17:51.680 --> 17:53.320
I told them about the voices.

17:54.720 --> 17:56.480
My father took me
in the middle of the night,

17:56.560 --> 17:58.800
so as not to upset
my brothers and sisters.

18:00.040 --> 18:05.120
We drove for a whole day until, finally,
he stopped by the side of the road,

18:05.880 --> 18:09.040
sat me down,
and told me that I was a demon

18:09.120 --> 18:14.120
and that, for the sake of my family,
I should never return to the village.

18:17.120 --> 18:18.320
I started to cry.

18:20.280 --> 18:21.480
I cried a lot that day.

18:21.560 --> 18:24.960
I cried till there was
nothing left to cry,

18:25.040 --> 18:29.360
until the sound of my own wailing
became somewhat amusing.

18:33.040 --> 18:34.520
For the longest time,

18:35.120 --> 18:37.560
I used to think
they really believed I was a demon.

18:38.840 --> 18:40.320
And then I realized...

18:41.440 --> 18:43.400
people believe what they want to believe.

18:45.680 --> 18:48.160
-I wish you well, Tripitaka.
-[sighs]

18:48.880 --> 18:50.200
You and your new family.

18:53.560 --> 18:54.560
[sighs]

18:54.640 --> 18:56.640
[thunder rumbling]

18:58.160 --> 19:00.160
[rain pattering]

19:04.800 --> 19:06.640
[font demon] Good woman
of the North Water.

19:07.400 --> 19:10.400
Will the girl be joining you
on your trip to the Gandara Sea?

19:11.560 --> 19:12.480
Yes.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.400
-And the god?
-No.

19:16.800 --> 19:18.240
Then you have done very well.

19:18.800 --> 19:20.720
The master will be pleased.

19:20.800 --> 19:22.520
[thunder rumbling]

19:41.680 --> 19:43.680
[birds calling]

20:06.480 --> 20:08.120
[sighs heavily]

20:26.000 --> 20:27.080
Why are we stopping?

20:27.600 --> 20:29.360
You have to leave.

20:29.440 --> 20:30.640
But why?

20:32.000 --> 20:33.400
I thought I could do this.

20:33.480 --> 20:35.360
They said they'd take
my girls if I didn't.

20:39.240 --> 20:40.880
I'm not your mother.

20:43.480 --> 20:44.840
What?

20:44.920 --> 20:48.000
Please, just leave now.

21:03.640 --> 21:05.160
Promise me something.

21:07.280 --> 21:09.600
Promise me you'll take them
to the Gandara Sea.

21:17.240 --> 21:18.080
Wait.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.600
I can tell you one thing
about your mother.

21:22.200 --> 21:24.400
She would be proud
of the woman you've become.

21:25.200 --> 21:27.680
I hope my girls grow up to be
as strong as you.

22:03.720 --> 22:06.200
New delivery. Big one.

22:06.280 --> 22:07.640
What happened to your men?

22:08.200 --> 22:10.240
Well, funny story, actually.

22:11.040 --> 22:14.440
Uh, there was this, uh...
[continues indistinctly]

22:22.280 --> 22:25.680
...leapt out of a tree,
or might have come from underneath a log.

22:25.760 --> 22:27.600
[indistinct chatter]

22:36.480 --> 22:37.640
Welcome home.

23:12.040 --> 23:13.480
Tripitaka.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
Welcome.

23:16.080 --> 23:17.120
Who's that?

23:19.280 --> 23:20.520
It's Davari.

23:28.560 --> 23:30.800
You and I are about to change the world.

23:35.360 --> 23:37.200
[theme music playing]
