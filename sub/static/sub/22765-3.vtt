29:49.496 --> 29:52.290
just the two of us, alone.

30:26.199 --> 30:28.368
I booked us a room five minutes away.

30:32.748 --> 30:34.458
It worked for Dakota Johnson...

30:36.835 --> 30:40.088
We're not characters
in some trashy movie.

30:43.091 --> 30:45.301
This is real life.

30:45.302 --> 30:47.636
We're in a real marriage.

30:47.637 --> 30:51.057
I mean, never mind last night.

30:51.058 --> 30:56.062
What we do, it doesn't
take anything out of you?

30:56.063 --> 30:59.857
Of course. I'm just trying
to have some fun, Rob.

30:59.858 --> 31:01.276
Remember fun?

31:02.527 --> 31:05.738
You always used to love going to hotels,

31:05.739 --> 31:07.573
having me come by
in the middle of the day.

31:07.574 --> 31:09.075
[server] Can I get you anything else?

31:09.076 --> 31:11.119
- More wine, perhaps?
- No, we're fine, thank you.

31:24.883 --> 31:28.636
Stay. Have the green tea mochi.

31:28.637 --> 31:29.804
You're leaving?

31:29.805 --> 31:31.473
I can't do this, Tina.

31:32.516 --> 31:34.141
You shut me out for two years,

31:34.142 --> 31:37.520
and then you show up tonight,
100 miles an hour?

31:37.521 --> 31:40.439
It's just too confusing.

31:40.440 --> 31:41.525
I'm sorry.

31:43.235 --> 31:44.945
I'll get a Lyft.

32:01.663 --> 32:05.631
[phone ringing]

32:05.632 --> 32:07.341
Destiny?

32:07.342 --> 32:09.176
[auto-voice] <i>I'm sorry,</i>
<i>you have reached a number</i>

32:09.177 --> 32:11.762
<i>that has been disconnected or...</i>

32:11.763 --> 32:16.183
Hey! Is there a Youth
for the Truth meeting tonight?

32:16.184 --> 32:20.354
Those were banned after some guy
tried to swallow a lightbulb.

32:20.355 --> 32:23.983
[laughs] Forgot about that.

32:23.984 --> 32:26.318
So, what brings you
to these parts, partner?

32:26.319 --> 32:29.113
I'm trying to track
down Destiny Gonzalez.

32:29.114 --> 32:30.281
Have you seen her?

32:30.282 --> 32:31.991
Not since yesterday afternoon.

32:31.992 --> 32:33.909
She left for that
London trip right after

32:33.910 --> 32:36.036
- your <i>Vanity Fair</i> interview.
- Are you sure?

32:36.037 --> 32:37.789
I saw her get in a car
headed to the airport.

32:40.750 --> 32:43.377
Wearing it in the warm weather
always triggers my eczema.

32:43.378 --> 32:44.837
So, you never take it off?

32:44.838 --> 32:47.089
Once or twice.

32:47.090 --> 32:48.883
Did you see them?

32:48.884 --> 32:50.467
The lights?

32:50.468 --> 32:52.386
The lights?

32:52.387 --> 32:54.263
You know, the colors?

32:54.264 --> 32:55.765
The colors?

32:57.851 --> 33:00.644
Makes a weird tan line,
if that's what you mean.

33:00.645 --> 33:02.314
Yeah, same.

33:04.941 --> 33:08.068
Your grandfather sure was
a talented painter...

33:08.069 --> 33:09.486
though clearly he did

33:09.487 --> 33:11.698
his fair share of peyote
back in the day.

33:29.049 --> 33:31.884
So, when you said snow,
you were being literal.

33:31.885 --> 33:35.221
Did you think my smarthouse was
having a cocaine malfunction?

33:35.222 --> 33:37.806
Yes, snow is actually coming
from the ceiling,

33:37.807 --> 33:39.558
and I need your nerd brain
to make it stop.

33:39.559 --> 33:41.101
What does your mom's AI say about this?

33:41.102 --> 33:43.103
Wizey? She doesn't know
what's happening right now.

33:43.104 --> 33:45.439
Wizey! Ixnay on the snoway.

33:45.440 --> 33:49.109
[Wizey] <i>I am not responsible</i>
<i>for this precipitation anomaly.</i>

33:49.110 --> 33:52.696
I think... it was this.

33:52.697 --> 33:56.951
I think... it's magic!

33:56.952 --> 33:59.078
I mean, with all due respect
to your Wiccan beliefs,

33:59.079 --> 34:00.829
there's gotta be
a scientific explanation.

34:00.830 --> 34:02.414
Bullshit! Okay?

34:02.415 --> 34:04.333
One minute I was looking
at one of Amy's snowflakes,

34:04.334 --> 34:06.962
and then the next... it was snowing.

34:08.088 --> 34:10.215
It was like it read my mind.

34:11.757 --> 34:13.301
Let me see it for a second.

34:16.888 --> 34:18.097
[hisses]

34:18.098 --> 34:20.266
Ow! What the hell?

34:24.103 --> 34:27.898
- Did you just ask it to stop?
- No.

34:27.899 --> 34:30.359
<i>Nico, I have a message
from the alpha user.</i>

34:30.360 --> 34:32.527
<i>She is on her way home.</i>

34:32.529 --> 34:35.156
My mom. Shit!

34:39.786 --> 34:41.911
I can't believe we actually did it.

34:41.913 --> 34:44.081
I can. We spent years
working on that serum.

34:44.081 --> 34:45.748
I know, this is our nest egg, babe.

34:45.750 --> 34:47.333
I know! I'm so excited

34:47.335 --> 34:49.878
to never, ever get
a text about brie again.

34:49.879 --> 34:54.467
And we can finally...
stop hurting people.

34:55.467 --> 34:56.469
Yeah.

34:58.138 --> 35:00.431
Yeah. <i>¡Señor!</i>

35:00.432 --> 35:05.936
Uh... <i>Dos chicharrones</i>
<i>y una tinga para la señorita.</i>

35:05.937 --> 35:08.063
And don't forget about
our friend downstairs.

35:08.064 --> 35:09.481
Oh, right, um, you know what,

35:09.482 --> 35:12.443
we'll also take 30 of the carnitas,

35:12.444 --> 35:16.363
15 barbacoas and, uh...
Bup bup bup bup bup.

35:16.364 --> 35:18.282
Do you have any whole chickens?

35:18.283 --> 35:19.992
You know what, forget it.
Don't need the chicken.

35:19.993 --> 35:23.203
Okay, <i>señor, muy guapo.</i>

35:23.204 --> 35:25.164
You know we're gonna have
to tell the girls.

35:25.165 --> 35:27.666
Tell 'em what?

35:27.667 --> 35:30.377
Oh, that we're moving to a
remote ranch in the Yucatan

35:30.378 --> 35:32.421
with our prehistoric guard dog.

35:32.422 --> 35:34.673
That is a good idea.
They're gonna love that.

35:34.674 --> 35:37.551
Okay, I was hoping that we could
slow-roll it a bit more than that.

35:37.552 --> 35:40.888
Stace, Stace! The key part of a secret
plan is that it's a secret. Okay?

35:40.889 --> 35:43.724
We can't just tear them away from
their lives without any warning.

35:43.725 --> 35:46.185
Sweetie. Sweetie, listen to me.
Let's just surprise them.

35:46.186 --> 35:48.520
- Okay...
- With some beautiful soft-serve.

35:48.521 --> 35:50.731
- Oh, hon!
- What?

35:50.732 --> 35:53.400
- Spontaneous soft-serve?
- Yeah, they love soft-serve!

35:53.401 --> 35:55.819
That is so not us. They are gonna
know that we're hiding something.

35:55.820 --> 35:57.489
- Yeah, probably. You're right.
- Yeah.

35:59.908 --> 36:01.867
All I see from here is a giant toad

36:01.868 --> 36:04.329
and something that looks like
a dildo with wings.

36:05.789 --> 36:07.457
No naked chick.

36:08.750 --> 36:11.960
- Positive?
- Trust me, I'd know.

36:11.961 --> 36:13.796
Perhaps we should go closer.

36:13.797 --> 36:16.423
Perhaps we should just go
in the actual basement!

36:16.424 --> 36:18.801
No, Chase, that is a terrible idea!

36:18.802 --> 36:22.012
Aw, is someone a 'fraidy cat?

36:22.013 --> 36:25.099
Don't forget, you do have a strapping
lacrosse player at your side.

36:25.100 --> 36:26.684
I'm gonna bring my pepper spray.

36:26.685 --> 36:28.644
Way more reliable than lacrosse players.

36:28.645 --> 36:31.480
All right, suit yourself,
but I'll take these biceps

36:31.481 --> 36:33.316
over some spray can any day.

36:46.371 --> 36:47.622
[both giggling]

36:53.378 --> 36:55.422
I'm just happy to be away from him.

36:58.800 --> 37:02.095
You... have no idea.

37:15.900 --> 37:17.526
Towards the middle. Here we go.

37:17.527 --> 37:21.072
[Wizey] <i>The alpha user</i>
<i>is four miles away.</i>

37:22.365 --> 37:24.367
Aw...

37:36.004 --> 37:37.172
We good?

37:38.423 --> 37:39.965
What's that?

37:39.966 --> 37:41.759
It was Amy's. I found
it in my mom's desk.

37:41.760 --> 37:45.012
- She was hiding it.
- Why would she do that?

37:45.013 --> 37:47.807
[Wizey] <i>The alpha user has arrived.</i>

38:05.950 --> 38:08.577
[Tina] I'm home! Nico?

38:08.578 --> 38:10.078
Okay, what's your story?

38:10.079 --> 38:11.163
Um...

38:11.164 --> 38:13.373
[Tina] Nico?

38:13.374 --> 38:15.751
Just, like, look over there
for a second.

38:15.752 --> 38:16.835
Yeah.

38:16.836 --> 38:18.879
[Tina] I'm home!

38:18.880 --> 38:20.714
I said your eyes have to go over there!

38:20.715 --> 38:23.050
- Yeah, no, uh...
- Okay.

38:23.051 --> 38:25.886
Oh, okay.

38:25.887 --> 38:28.764
- Wow, I could just go here.
- Don't you even think about it!

38:28.765 --> 38:30.599
- I wasn't gonna...
- [Tina] Where are you?

38:30.600 --> 38:31.934
Did you want me to put 'em...

38:31.935 --> 38:33.393
- I could grab here.
- What are you grabbing?

38:33.394 --> 38:34.812
- I just thought that's where...
- No.

38:34.813 --> 38:36.438
- I saw it in a video.
- My hips at least, dude!

38:36.439 --> 38:38.399
- What's wrong with you? Okay.
- That's fine. I like hips.

38:43.029 --> 38:46.281
Here I thought you were
thinking of your father and me,

38:46.282 --> 38:49.786
but really you just wanted us
out of the house.

38:51.287 --> 38:53.080
Time for you to leave, Alex.

38:53.081 --> 38:56.584
Yeah, I was gonna...

39:04.509 --> 39:07.219
I mean, you could've called
anyone for help,

39:07.220 --> 39:08.929
but you called me.

39:08.930 --> 39:11.849
Like I said, I needed a nerd.

39:11.850 --> 39:14.102
I'm just glad you reached out.

39:16.271 --> 39:18.481
Thanks for coming over.

39:27.991 --> 39:31.451
Whoa, didn't you realize what
happened in there was an act?

39:31.452 --> 39:33.453
Was it?

39:33.454 --> 39:35.122
[car unlocks, beeps]

39:35.123 --> 39:37.208
Later, Hermione.

39:51.973 --> 39:54.142
Whose place is this?

39:55.393 --> 39:57.228
Work buddy give you their key?

39:59.480 --> 40:01.189
This is ours.

40:01.190 --> 40:03.651
I made a down payment on Monday.

40:08.489 --> 40:10.325
I'm ready to start living my life...

40:11.326 --> 40:12.368
with you.

40:13.369 --> 40:14.454
I'm ready to tell Tina.

40:15.747 --> 40:17.247
But we never talked about...

40:17.248 --> 40:20.000
Taking things to the next level?

40:20.001 --> 40:23.170
I have to make sure that none
of this blows back on Chase.

40:23.171 --> 40:25.714
And then there's PRIDE.

40:25.715 --> 40:27.424
PRIDE won't matter for much longer.

40:27.425 --> 40:29.176
We're about to break ground,

40:29.177 --> 40:31.511
be done with this thing.

40:31.512 --> 40:35.390
Then we'll finally be able to
start putting ourselves first.

40:35.391 --> 40:39.896
I just... I just need some
time to process, that's all.

41:13.262 --> 41:15.472
Are you serious? You saw my actual dick.

41:15.473 --> 41:18.308
Isn't that what you call, like,
a double standard or whatever?

After centuries
of patriarchal oppression,

41:35.410 --> 41:38.621
Destiny? Are you in there?

41:54.971 --> 41:57.723
That door must be made out of
the same stuff as your apron.

41:57.724 --> 42:01.101
I can't see inside, which means
there's only one thing left to do.

42:01.102 --> 42:02.519
- Hold on!
- What?

42:02.520 --> 42:04.229
You wanted to check out
your parents' lab.

42:04.230 --> 42:05.731
What, are you gonna pussy out now?

42:05.732 --> 42:07.692
I resent the usage of that
word to imply weakness.

42:16.242 --> 42:18.202
[groans]

42:20.538 --> 42:23.081
I don't think that was Destiny.

42:23.082 --> 42:25.877
Now would be a really good time
to use those.

42:28.963 --> 42:31.965
[Chase] Oh, God.

42:31.966 --> 42:33.425
Let's leave.

42:37.472 --> 42:40.432
Deep breaths. Calm down.

42:40.433 --> 42:43.351
[hyperventilating] Okay, calm down.
Deep breaths.

42:43.352 --> 42:46.313
Calm down. Okay.
Everything's under control.

42:46.314 --> 42:48.732
Hey, doggie, do you hear me?
I need you to back down.

42:48.733 --> 42:51.443
I'm under control.
Chase is under control.

42:51.444 --> 42:53.528
Even this bloodthirsty
dinosaur's under control.

42:53.529 --> 42:56.907
[panting sharply]

42:56.908 --> 42:59.911
Actually, it kind of is.

43:01.913 --> 43:04.040

43:25.269 --> 43:27.312
I don't understand.

43:27.313 --> 43:29.816
It's never taken this long before.

43:31.526 --> 43:33.653
You don't feel anything at all?

43:37.657 --> 43:39.909
[electronically distorted] Nothing.

43:54.799 --> 43:57.884
Sorry to bug you, but I ran
into Karolina earlier.

43:57.885 --> 43:59.678
She was asking about Destiny.

43:59.679 --> 44:01.388
She's on a mission trip, right?

44:01.389 --> 44:02.508
[phone buzzes]

44:02.533 --> 44:04.283
One second.

44:04.308 --> 44:06.977
- [beep]
- I'm gonna have to call you back.

44:06.978 --> 44:08.562
Turn on the local news.

44:08.563 --> 44:10.438
- I'm not near a TV.
<i>- I'll wait.</i>

<i>If you know anything
about Destiny Gonzalez,</i>

<i>- About 30 minutes ago.</i>

<i>- Have you spoken to Victor?</i>
- He's not picking up his phone.

44:34.839 --> 44:37.007
Neither is his idiot wife.
