01:28.040 --> 01:30.240
How's your blog going?

01:31.800 --> 01:35.600
Yeah, good, very good.

01:35.600 --> 01:37.280
You haven't written a word, have you?

01:37.280 --> 01:40.120
You just wrote
"still has trust issues".

01:40.120 --> 01:42.160
And you read my writing upside down.

01:44.120 --> 01:46.800
You see what I mean?

01:46.800 --> 01:50.720
John, you're a soldier

01:51.760 --> 01:55.360
and it's going to take you
a while to adjust to civilian life

01:55.360 --> 02:00.200
and writing a blog
about everything that happens to you
will honestly help you.

02:01.840 --> 02:03.680
Nothing happens to me.

02:41.200 --> 02:44.680
'What do you mean there's no ruddy
car?' He went to Waterloo, I'm sorry.

02:44.680 --> 02:47.360
Get a cab! I never get cabs!

02:49.280 --> 02:51.200
I love you. When?

02:51.200 --> 02:53.400
Get a cab!

03:12.880 --> 03:15.000
My husband

03:15.000 --> 03:19.200
was a happy man
who lived life to the full.

03:19.200 --> 03:23.520
He loved his family and his work,

03:23.520 --> 03:28.040
and that he should have
taken his own life in this way

03:28.040 --> 03:30.080
is a mystery

03:30.080 --> 03:33.400
and a shock to all who knew him.

03:46.640 --> 03:48.200
Taxi, taxi!

03:52.160 --> 03:54.160
I'll be just two minutes, mate.
What?

03:54.160 --> 03:57.200
I'm just going home to get
my umbrella. You can share mine.

03:57.200 --> 03:58.640
Two minutes, all right?

04:33.680 --> 04:35.440
She still dancing?

04:35.440 --> 04:37.240
Yeah, if you can call it that.

04:37.240 --> 04:40.320
Did you get the car keys off her?
Got them out of her bag.

04:40.320 --> 04:42.960
Where is she?

04:57.960 --> 05:00.280
The body of Beth Davenport,
Junior Minister for Transport,

05:00.280 --> 05:04.920
was found late last night
on a building site in Greater London.

05:04.920 --> 05:08.560
Preliminary investigations
suggest that this was suicide.

05:08.560 --> 05:12.520
We can confirm that this apparent
suicide closely resembles those of

05:12.520 --> 05:15.280
Sir Jeffrey Patterson
and James Phillimore.

05:15.280 --> 05:18.920
In the light of this, these incidents
are now being treated as linked.

05:18.920 --> 05:23.920
The investigation is ongoing
but Detective Inspector Lestrade
will take questions now.

05:23.920 --> 05:26.280
Detective Inspector,
how can suicides be linked?

05:26.280 --> 05:29.400
Well, they all took the same poison.

05:29.400 --> 05:32.600
They were all found in places
they had no reason to be.

05:32.600 --> 05:35.760
None of them had shown any prior
indication. But you can't have
serial suicides.

05:35.760 --> 05:37.440
Well, apparently you can.

05:37.440 --> 05:40.480
These three people,
there's nothing that links them?

05:40.480 --> 05:43.000
There's no link we've found yet but

05:43.000 --> 05:45.240
we're looking for it.
There has to be one.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.560
If you've all got texts, please
ignore them. It just says "Wrong".

05:55.560 --> 05:57.960
Well, just ignore that.
If there are no more questions,

05:57.960 --> 06:00.600
I'm going to bring
this session to an end.

06:00.600 --> 06:03.280
If they're suicides,
what are you investigating?

06:03.280 --> 06:08.600
As I say, these suicides
are clearly linked.

06:08.600 --> 06:13.280
It's an unusual situation, we've
got our best people investigating.

06:16.040 --> 06:18.160
Says "Wrong" again.

06:18.160 --> 06:22.360
One more question. Is there any
chance that these are murders?

06:22.360 --> 06:25.120
And if they are, is this
the work of a serial killer?

06:25.120 --> 06:29.960
I know that you like
writing about these but these
do appear to be suicides.

06:29.960 --> 06:34.000
We know the difference. The poison
was clearly self-administered.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.040
Yes, but if they are murders,
how do people keep themselves safe?

06:37.040 --> 06:39.600
Well, don't commit suicide.

06:39.600 --> 06:40.960
Daily Mail!

06:40.960 --> 06:48.840
This is a frightening time
for people but all anyone has to do
is exercise reasonable precautions.

06:48.840 --> 06:51.720
We are all as safe as we want to be.

06:51.720 --> 06:54.080
MOBILE PHONES BUZZ

06:59.200 --> 07:00.680
Thank you.

07:04.400 --> 07:07.800
You've got to stop him doing that.
He's making us look like idiots.

07:07.800 --> 07:10.360
If you can tell me
how he does it, I'll stop him.

07:21.880 --> 07:23.440
John!

07:23.440 --> 07:25.080
John Watson!

07:26.040 --> 07:30.840
Stamford, Mike Stamford.
We were at Barts together.
Yes, sorry, yes, Mike, hello.

07:30.840 --> 07:33.320
Yes, I know, I got fat. No, no.

07:33.320 --> 07:36.120
I heard you were abroad somewhere
getting shot at. What happened?

07:36.120 --> 07:38.600
I got shot.

07:44.080 --> 07:46.600
Are you still at Barts then?

07:46.600 --> 07:49.880
Teaching now, yeah, bright
young things like we used to be.

07:49.880 --> 07:51.960
God, I hate them.

07:51.960 --> 07:54.680
What about you, just staying in
town till you get yourself sorted?

07:54.680 --> 07:56.440
I can't afford London
on an Army pension.

07:56.440 --> 08:01.160
Couldn't bear to be anywhere else.
That's not the John Watson I know.
I'm not the John Watson.

08:06.440 --> 08:08.560
Couldn't Harry help?

08:08.560 --> 08:10.640
Yeah, like that's going to happen(!)

08:10.640 --> 08:13.680
I don't know,
get a flatshare or something?

08:13.680 --> 08:15.360
Who'd want me for a flatmate?

08:17.800 --> 08:19.480
What?

08:19.480 --> 08:22.920
You're the second person
to say that to me today.

08:22.920 --> 08:24.280
Who was the first?

08:26.560 --> 08:28.840
How fresh?

08:28.840 --> 08:31.720
Just in. 67, natural causes.

08:31.720 --> 08:34.880
Used to work here.
I knew him, he was nice.

08:34.880 --> 08:37.120
Fine.

08:37.120 --> 08:39.280
We'll start with the riding crop.

08:49.720 --> 08:53.080
So, bad day was it?

08:54.400 --> 08:58.200
I need to know what bruises
form in the next 20 minutes.
A man's alibi depends on it. Text me.

08:58.200 --> 09:01.520
Listen, I was wondering.
Maybe later, when you're finished...

09:01.520 --> 09:03.600
You're wearing lipstick.
You weren't wearing lipstick before.

09:03.600 --> 09:07.560
I refreshed it a bit.

09:07.560 --> 09:10.080
Sorry, you were saying?

09:10.080 --> 09:12.880
I was wondering
if you'd like to have coffee?

09:12.880 --> 09:15.600
Black, two sugars, please.
I'll be upstairs.

09:17.480 --> 09:19.160
OK.

09:22.320 --> 09:24.320
KNOCK ON DOOR

09:31.160 --> 09:34.280
Bit different from my day.
You've no idea!

09:34.280 --> 09:36.480
Mike, can I borrow your phone?
There's no signal on mine.

09:36.480 --> 09:39.360
And what's wrong with the landline?
I prefer to text.

09:39.360 --> 09:42.520
Sorry, it's in my coat.

09:43.720 --> 09:46.280
Here, use mine.

09:46.360 --> 09:48.800
Oh, thank you.

09:48.800 --> 09:51.920
This is an old friend of mine,
John Watson.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.320
Afghanistan or Iraq?

09:59.840 --> 10:02.520
Sorry?
Which was it, in Afghanistan or Iraq?

10:05.200 --> 10:07.840
Afghanistan, sorry,
how did you know?

10:07.840 --> 10:09.960
Ah! Coffee, thank you.

10:09.960 --> 10:11.520
What happened to the lipstick?

10:11.520 --> 10:13.360
It wasn't working for me.

10:13.360 --> 10:17.560
Really? It was a big improvement.
Your mouth's too small now.

10:17.560 --> 10:19.120
OK.

10:20.240 --> 10:21.760
How do you feel about the violin?

10:24.960 --> 10:27.520
I'm sorry, what?

10:27.520 --> 10:31.480
I play the violin when I'm thinking
and sometimes I don't talk for days
on end. Would that bother you?

10:31.480 --> 10:33.680
Potential flatmates should know
the worst about each other.

10:36.280 --> 10:38.480
You told him about me? Not a word.

10:38.480 --> 10:40.360
Who said anything about flatmates?

10:40.360 --> 10:44.680
I did. Told Mike this morning
that I must be a difficult man
to find a flatmate for.

10:44.680 --> 10:47.920
Now here he is just after lunch with
an old friend clearly just home from

10:47.920 --> 10:50.760
military service in Afghanistan.
Wasn't a difficult leap.

10:50.760 --> 10:53.200
How did you know about Afghanistan?

10:53.200 --> 10:55.440
Got my eye on a nice little place
in central London.

10:55.440 --> 10:57.120
We ought to be able to afford it.

10:57.120 --> 10:59.200
We'll meet there tomorrow
evening, seven o'clock.

10:59.200 --> 11:03.120
Sorry, got to dash. I think I left
my riding crop in the mortuary.

11:03.120 --> 11:04.680
Is that it?

11:04.680 --> 11:06.640
Is that what?

11:06.640 --> 11:10.360
We've only just met and we're
going to go and look at a flat?

11:10.360 --> 11:12.120
Problem?

11:14.160 --> 11:16.200
We don't know
a thing about each other.

11:16.200 --> 11:19.720
I don't know where we're meeting,
I don't even know your name.

11:19.720 --> 11:22.760
I know you're an Army doctor
and you've been invalided home
from Afghanistan.

11:22.760 --> 11:25.880
You've got a brother worried
about you but you won't go
to him for help because you don't

11:25.880 --> 11:30.520
approve of him, possibly because he's
an alcoholic, more likely because
he recently walked out on his wife.

11:30.520 --> 11:35.080
And I know that your therapist
thinks your limp's psychosomatic,
quite correctly, I'm afraid.

11:35.080 --> 11:37.560
That's enough to be going
on with, don't you think?

11:41.160 --> 11:45.760
The name's Sherlock Holmes
and the address is 221B Baker Street.

11:45.760 --> 11:47.280
Afternoon.

11:50.520 --> 11:52.960
Yeah, he's always like that.

12:57.800 --> 12:59.200
Hello.

12:59.200 --> 13:02.240
Ah - Mr Holmes. Sherlock, please.

13:03.280 --> 13:05.600
Well, this is a prime spot.
Must be expensive.

13:05.600 --> 13:08.600
Mrs Hudson, the landlady -
she's given me a special deal.

13:08.600 --> 13:13.360
Owes me a favour. A few years back,
her husband got himself
sentenced to death in Florida.

13:13.360 --> 13:17.280
I was able to help out. Sorry - you
stopped her husband being executed?

13:17.280 --> 13:18.840
Oh, no, I ensured it.

13:20.360 --> 13:22.480
Sherlock!

13:22.480 --> 13:24.040
Mrs Hudson, Dr John Watson.

13:24.040 --> 13:27.040
Hello. Come in. Thank you.
Shall we...?

13:53.120 --> 13:54.720
Well, this could be very nice.

13:56.400 --> 13:58.080
Very nice indeed.

13:58.080 --> 14:00.440
Yes.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.960
Yes, I think so,
my thoughts precisely.

14:02.960 --> 14:08.840
TOGETHER: So I went straight ahead
and moved in. Soon as we get all this
rubbish cleaned out...

14:08.840 --> 14:14.040
So this is all... Well, obviously I
can erm...straighten things up a bit.

14:14.040 --> 14:17.120
That's a skull. Friend of mine.

14:17.120 --> 14:18.760
When I say friend...

14:18.760 --> 14:21.840
What do you think, then, Dr Watson?

14:21.840 --> 14:25.840
There's another bedroom upstairs,
if you'll be needing two bedrooms.

14:25.840 --> 14:27.840
Of course we'll be needing two.

14:27.840 --> 14:33.680
Oh, don't worry, there's all sorts
round here. Mrs Turner next door's
got (married ones).

14:35.040 --> 14:39.520
Oh...
Sherlock! The mess you've made.

14:45.960 --> 14:47.720
I looked you up on
the internet last night.

14:50.240 --> 14:54.200
Anything interesting? Found your
website. The Science of Deduction.

14:54.200 --> 14:55.520
What did you think?

14:58.080 --> 15:02.440
You said you could identify
a software designer by his tie and
an airline pilot by his left thumb?

15:02.440 --> 15:03.720
Yes.

15:03.720 --> 15:06.360
And I can read your military career
in your face and your leg,

15:06.360 --> 15:09.440
and your brother's drinking habits
on your mobile phone.

15:09.440 --> 15:10.560
How?

15:12.400 --> 15:16.640
What about these suicides then,
Sherlock? I thought that'd be
right up your street.

15:16.640 --> 15:19.160
Three exactly the same.

15:19.160 --> 15:20.400
Four.

15:22.120 --> 15:25.960
There's been a fourth.
And there's something different
this time. A fourth?

15:28.360 --> 15:31.640
Where? Brixton, Lauriston Gardens.

15:31.640 --> 15:34.480
What's new about this one? You
wouldn't have come to me otherwise.

15:34.480 --> 15:37.160
You know how they never leave notes?
Yeah. This one did.

15:37.160 --> 15:39.120
Will you come?

15:39.120 --> 15:41.000
Who's on forensics? Anderson.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.680
He doesn't work well with me.

15:43.680 --> 15:46.320
Well, he won't be your assistant.
I NEED an assistant.

15:46.320 --> 15:48.920
Will you come? Not in a police car,
I'll be right behind.

15:49.960 --> 15:51.720
Thank you.

15:59.320 --> 16:01.320
Brilliant! Yes!

16:02.360 --> 16:04.600
Four serial suicides, and now a note.

16:04.600 --> 16:08.760
Oh, it's Christmas. Mrs Hudson,
I'll be late. Might need some food.

16:08.760 --> 16:11.520
I'm your landlady, dear,
not your housekeeper.

16:11.520 --> 16:15.120
Something cold will do. John, have
a cup of tea, make yourself at home.

16:15.120 --> 16:16.880
Don't wait up!

16:16.880 --> 16:19.400
Look at him, dashing about...

16:19.400 --> 16:26.440
My husband was just the same.
But you're more
the sitting-down type, I can tell.

16:26.440 --> 16:28.600
I'll make you that cuppa,
you rest your leg.

16:28.600 --> 16:31.200
Damn my leg! Sorry, I'm so sorry -

16:31.200 --> 16:34.120
It's just sometimes
this bloody thing...

16:34.120 --> 16:36.960
I understand, dear, I've got a hip.

16:36.960 --> 16:40.960
Cup of tea'd be lovely. Thank you.
Just this once, dear,
I'm not your housekeeper.

16:40.960 --> 16:44.720
Couple of biscuits too, if you've
got 'em. Not your housekeeper!

16:48.240 --> 16:49.880
You're a doctor.

16:50.880 --> 16:52.600
In fact you're an Army doctor.

16:53.840 --> 16:55.960
Yes.

16:55.960 --> 16:57.440
Any good?

16:58.400 --> 16:59.480
Very good.

17:00.520 --> 17:03.280
Seen a lot of injuries, then.
Violent deaths.

17:03.280 --> 17:05.319
Well, yes.

17:05.319 --> 17:06.920
Bit of trouble too, I bet?

17:06.920 --> 17:11.200
Of course. Yes.
Enough for a lifetime, far too much.

17:12.200 --> 17:15.200
Want to see some more? Oh, God, yes.

17:18.440 --> 17:22.040
Sorry Mrs Hudson, I'll skip the tea.
Off out. Both of you?

17:23.000 --> 17:25.359
Impossible suicides? Four of them?

17:25.359 --> 17:28.520
No point sitting at home when there's
finally something fun going on!

17:28.520 --> 17:31.920
Look at you, all happy. It's not
decent. Who cares about decent?

17:31.920 --> 17:34.320
The game, Mrs Hudson, is on!

17:40.040 --> 17:41.440
Taxi!

18:18.120 --> 18:19.720
OK, You've got questions...

18:19.720 --> 18:21.760
Yeah, where are we going?

18:21.760 --> 18:24.200
Crime scene. Next?

18:24.200 --> 18:26.360
Who are you, what do you do?
What do you think?

18:26.360 --> 18:29.960
I'd say...private detective. But?

18:29.960 --> 18:31.880
But the police don't go
to private detectives.

18:32.880 --> 18:36.600
I'm a consulting detective. Only
one in the world, I invented the job.

18:36.600 --> 18:40.840
What does that mean? Means when
the police are out of their depth,
which is always,

18:40.840 --> 18:44.800
they consult me.
The police don't consult amateurs.

18:46.360 --> 18:50.720
When I met you for the first time
yesterday, I said Afghanistan
or Iraq. You looked surprised.

18:50.720 --> 18:53.800
Yes, how DID you know?
I didn't know, I saw.

18:53.800 --> 18:56.720
'Your haircut, the way
you hold yourself says military.

18:56.720 --> 18:59.200
'But your conversation...'
Bit different from my day.

18:59.200 --> 19:02.120
..said trained at Barts -
so Army doctor, obvious.

19:03.160 --> 19:04.880
'Your face is tanned...

19:04.880 --> 19:08.280
'but no tan above the wrists. You've
been abroad, but not sunbathing.

19:08.280 --> 19:12.360
'Your limp's really bad
when you walk, but you don't ask
for a chair when you stand -

19:12.360 --> 19:14.360
'so it's at least partly
psychosomatic.

19:14.360 --> 19:17.520
'That says the original circumstances
of the injury were traumatic -'

19:17.520 --> 19:22.440
wounded in action then. Wounded in
action, suntan - Afghanistan or Iraq.

19:22.440 --> 19:24.160
You said I had a therapist.

19:24.160 --> 19:27.280
You've got a psychosomatic limp,
of course you've got a therapist.

19:27.280 --> 19:29.160
Then there's your brother. Mm?
Your phone.

19:29.160 --> 19:31.200
'It's expensive,
e-mail enabled, MP3 player.'

19:31.200 --> 19:34.440
And you're looking for a flatshare.
You wouldn't buy this - it's a gift.

19:34.440 --> 19:36.680
'Scratches.
Not one, many over time -'

19:36.680 --> 19:38.640
it's been in the same pocket
as keys and coins.

19:38.640 --> 19:40.840
You wouldn't treat
your one luxury item like this,

19:40.840 --> 19:43.960
so it's had a previous owner.
Next bit's easy. You know it already.

19:43.960 --> 19:45.520
The engraving?

19:45.520 --> 19:48.560
Harry Watson. Clearly a family
member who's given you his old phone.

19:48.560 --> 19:50.800
Not your father,
this is a young man's gadget.

19:50.800 --> 19:53.840
Could be a cousin, but you're a war
hero who can't find a place to live -

19:53.840 --> 19:57.800
unlikely you've got an extended
family, not one you're close to.
So brother it is.

19:57.800 --> 20:00.720
Now, who's Clara? Three kisses
says it's a romantic attachment.

20:00.720 --> 20:04.120
The expense of the phone
says wife, not girlfriend.

20:04.120 --> 20:06.680
Must have given it to him recently,
it's only six months old.

20:06.680 --> 20:09.360
Marriage in trouble then -
six months on he's given it away.

20:09.360 --> 20:11.640
If she'd left HIM,
he would have kept it. Sentiment.

20:11.640 --> 20:13.520
No, he wanted rid of it. He left HER.

20:13.520 --> 20:15.960
He gave the phone to you,
so he wants you to stay in touch.

20:15.960 --> 20:20.120
You're looking for cheap
accommodation, but you're not
going to your brother for help -

20:20.120 --> 20:24.720
that says you've got problems
with him. Maybe you liked his wife,
or don't like his drinking.

20:24.720 --> 20:27.800
How can you possibly know
about the drinking?

20:27.800 --> 20:29.920
Shot in the dark. Good one, though.

20:29.920 --> 20:32.200
Power connection -
tiny little scuff marks round it.

20:32.200 --> 20:34.720
Every night he plugs it in
but his hands are shaking.

20:34.720 --> 20:36.800
You never see those marks
on a sober man's phone,

20:36.800 --> 20:41.160
never see a drunk's without them.
There you go, you were right.
I was right? Right about what?

20:41.160 --> 20:43.440
The police don't consult amateurs.

20:46.080 --> 20:48.920
That...was amazing.

20:52.240 --> 20:56.280
Do you think so? Of course it was.
It was extraordinary,
it was quite extraordinary.

20:56.280 --> 20:59.160
That's not what people normally say.
What do people normally say?

20:59.160 --> 21:00.640
Piss off!

21:12.400 --> 21:14.120
Did I get anything wrong?

21:15.160 --> 21:18.040
Harry and me don't get on,
never have,

21:18.040 --> 21:21.200
Clara and Harry split up
three months ago

21:21.200 --> 21:23.280
and they're getting a divorce,

21:23.280 --> 21:24.760
and Harry is a drinker.

21:24.760 --> 21:27.520
Spot on, then. I didn't expect
to be right about everything.

21:27.520 --> 21:29.480
Harry's short for Harriet.

21:30.600 --> 21:34.280
Harry's your sister.
Look, what exactly am I supposed
to be doing here? Sister!

21:34.280 --> 21:37.720
No - seriously, what am I doing
here? There's always something.

21:37.720 --> 21:41.320
Hello, freak! I'm here to see
Detective Inspector Lestrade.

21:41.320 --> 21:42.840
Why?

21:42.840 --> 21:44.040
I was invited.

21:44.040 --> 21:46.040
Why?
I think he wants me to take a look.

21:46.040 --> 21:49.560
Well, you know what I think,
don't you? Always Sally.

21:49.560 --> 21:52.640
I even know you didn't
make it home last night.

21:52.640 --> 21:55.480
I don't... Who's this?
Colleague of mine, Dr Watson.

21:55.480 --> 21:57.280
Dr Watson, Sergeant Sally Donovan.

21:57.280 --> 21:58.840
Old friend.

21:58.840 --> 22:02.520
A colleague(?)
How do YOU get a colleague?

22:02.520 --> 22:03.840
Did he follow you home?

22:03.840 --> 22:06.400
Would it be better
if I just waited... No.

22:07.360 --> 22:09.520
Freak's here. Bringing him in.

22:18.120 --> 22:21.160
Ah, Anderson. Here we are again.

22:21.160 --> 22:25.080
It's a crime scene. I don't want it
contaminated. Are we clear on that?

22:25.080 --> 22:27.200
Quite clear.

22:27.200 --> 22:29.080
And is your wife away for long?

22:29.080 --> 22:31.760
Oh, don't pretend you worked
that out. Somebody told you that.

22:31.760 --> 22:33.160
Your deodorant told me that.

22:33.160 --> 22:34.280
My deodorant?

22:34.280 --> 22:38.080
It's for men. Well, of course
it's for men - I'm wearing it.

22:38.080 --> 22:39.320
So's Sergeant Donovan.

22:41.080 --> 22:43.720
Ooh... I think it just vaporised.
May I go in?

22:43.720 --> 22:45.240
Whatever you're trying to imply...

22:45.240 --> 22:51.080
I'm not implying anything. I'm sure
Sally came round for a nice little
chat, and just happened to stay over.

22:51.080 --> 22:54.760
And I assume she scrubbed
your floors, going by
the state of her knees.

23:05.800 --> 23:07.520
You'll need to wear one of these.

23:07.520 --> 23:08.960
Who's this?

23:08.960 --> 23:10.520
He's with me.

23:10.520 --> 23:13.160
But who is he? I said he's with me.

23:15.400 --> 23:17.440
Aren't you going to put one on?

23:20.280 --> 23:23.160
So where are we? Upstairs.

23:30.200 --> 23:32.760
I can give you two minutes.

23:32.760 --> 23:35.080
May need longer.

23:35.080 --> 23:37.760
Her name's Jennifer Wilson
according to her credit cards,

23:37.760 --> 23:40.440
we're running them now
for contact details.

23:40.440 --> 23:42.200
Hasn't been here long.

23:42.200 --> 23:43.800
Some kids found her.

24:16.720 --> 24:19.200
Shut up.

24:19.200 --> 24:21.680
I didn't say anything.
You were thinking. It's annoying.

25:34.200 --> 25:36.160
Got anything?

25:36.160 --> 25:38.160
Not much.

25:38.160 --> 25:40.360
She's German.

25:40.360 --> 25:43.920
Rache. It's German for revenge.
She could be trying to
tell us something...

25:43.920 --> 25:45.880
Yes, thank you for your input.

25:45.880 --> 25:49.160
So she's German? Of course she's
not. She's from out of town though.

25:49.160 --> 25:50.880
Intended to stay in London
for one night

25:50.880 --> 25:54.040
before returning home to Cardiff.
So far, so obvious.

25:54.040 --> 25:56.080
Sorry - obvious?
What about the message though?

25:56.080 --> 25:57.560
Dr Watson, what do you think?

25:57.560 --> 25:59.920
Of the message?
Of the body. You're a medical man.

25:59.920 --> 26:01.520
We have a whole team right outside.

26:01.520 --> 26:04.600
They won't work with me. I'm breaking
every rule letting YOU in here...

26:04.600 --> 26:07.000
Yes...because you need me.

26:08.040 --> 26:10.360
Yes, I do.

26:10.360 --> 26:11.640
God help me.

26:11.640 --> 26:13.400
Dr Watson! Hm?

26:14.960 --> 26:17.160
Oh, do as he says. Help yourself.

26:19.440 --> 26:23.040
Anderson, keep everyone out
for a couple of minutes...

26:24.280 --> 26:26.360
Well? What am I doing here?

26:26.360 --> 26:30.080
Helping me make a point. I'm supposed
to be helping you pay the rent.
This is more fun.

26:30.080 --> 26:32.400
Fun? There's a woman lying dead.

26:32.400 --> 26:35.920
Perfectly sound analysis,
but I WAS hoping you'd go deeper.

26:54.360 --> 26:56.200
Yeah...

26:56.200 --> 26:59.800
Asphyxiation, probably.
Passed out, choked on her own vomit.

26:59.800 --> 27:01.520
Can't smell any alcohol on her.

27:01.520 --> 27:03.720
It could have been a seizure.
Possibly drugs.

27:03.720 --> 27:05.640
You know what it was,
you've read the papers.

27:05.640 --> 27:07.880
Well, she's one of the suicides.
The fourth...?

27:07.880 --> 27:10.880
Sherlock - two minutes, I said,
I need anything you got.

27:10.880 --> 27:14.480
Victim is in her late 30s.
Professional person,
going by her clothes -

27:14.480 --> 27:17.760
I'm guessing the media, going by
the frankly alarming shade of pink.

27:17.760 --> 27:22.080
Travelled from Cardiff today
intending to stay in London one night
from the size of her suitcase.

27:22.080 --> 27:25.680
Suitcase? Yes. She's been married
at least ten years, but not happily.

27:25.680 --> 27:28.480
She's had a string of lovers but
none of them knew she was married.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.760
Oh, for God's sake,
if you're just making this up...

27:30.760 --> 27:33.320
Her wedding ring.
Ten years old at least.

27:33.320 --> 27:38.600
The rest of her jewellery
has been regularly cleaned,
but not her wedding ring.

27:38.600 --> 27:40.400
The inside
is shinier than the outside.

27:40.400 --> 27:43.120
The only polishing it gets
is when she works it off her finger.

27:43.120 --> 27:48.520
It's not for work, look at her nails.
She doesn't work with her hands
so who DOES she remove her rings for?

27:48.520 --> 27:52.240
Not ONE lover,
she'd never sustain the fiction
of being single for that long

27:52.240 --> 27:54.200
so more likely a string of them.
Brilliant.

27:54.960 --> 27:56.640
Sorry. Cardiff?

27:56.640 --> 27:59.880
It's obvious, isn't it?
It's not obvious to me.

28:00.880 --> 28:05.160
Dear God, what is it like
in your funny little brains,
it must be so boring. Her coat -

28:05.160 --> 28:07.880
it's slightly damp, she's been
in heavy rain the last few hours -

28:07.880 --> 28:09.600
no rain anywhere in London
in that time.

28:09.600 --> 28:13.240
Under her coat collar is damp too.
She's turned it up against the wind.

28:13.240 --> 28:15.800
She's got an umbrella in her pocket
but it's dry and unused.

28:15.800 --> 28:18.360
Not just wind, strong wind -
too strong to use her umbrella.

28:18.360 --> 28:21.280
We know from her suitcase that
she was intending to stay overnight

28:21.280 --> 28:25.640
but she can't have travelled more
than two or three hours because
her coat still hasn't dried.

28:25.640 --> 28:29.800
So - where has there been
heavy rain and strong wind within
the radius of that travel time?

28:29.800 --> 28:31.120
Cardiff.

28:31.120 --> 28:33.440
Fantastic.
Do you know you do that out loud?

28:33.440 --> 28:36.080
Sorry, I'll shut up.
No, it's...fine.

28:36.080 --> 28:39.120
Why do you keep saying suitcase?
Yes, where is it?

28:39.120 --> 28:44.160
She must have had a phone or
an organiser. Find out who Rachel is.
She was writing Rachel?

28:44.160 --> 28:48.840
No, she was leaving an angry note
in German - of course she was writing
Rachel, no other word it can be.

28:48.840 --> 28:52.760
Why did she wait until she was dying
to write it? How do you know
she had a suitcase?

28:52.760 --> 28:55.800
Tiny splash marks on her right heel
and calf not present on the left.

28:55.800 --> 29:00.360
She was dragging a wheeled suitcase
behind her with her right hand,
by that splash pattern.

29:00.360 --> 29:02.520
Smallish case, going by the spread.

29:02.520 --> 29:04.280
Case that size,
woman this clothes-conscious -

29:04.280 --> 29:07.240
could only be an overnight bag
so we know she was staying one night.

29:07.240 --> 29:08.680
Where is it,
what have you done with it?

29:08.680 --> 29:10.520
There wasn't a case.

29:13.080 --> 29:16.520
Say that again. There wasn't a case.
There was never any suitcase.

29:16.520 --> 29:21.000
Suitcase! Did anyone find a suitcase?
Was there a suitcase in this house?

29:21.000 --> 29:22.600
Sir, there was no case!

29:22.600 --> 29:25.360
But they take the poison themselves,
swallow the pills.

29:25.360 --> 29:28.920
There are clear signs,
even you lot couldn't miss them.
Right, thanks. And...?

29:29.920 --> 29:32.040
It's murder, all of them.
I don't know how.

29:32.040 --> 29:34.400
But they're not suicides,
they're serial killings.

29:34.400 --> 29:37.760
We've got a serial killer. There's
always something to look forward to.

29:37.760 --> 29:41.800
Why are you saying that?
Her case! Come on, where is her case?

29:41.800 --> 29:45.760
Did she eat it(?) Someone else
was here, and they took her case.

29:45.760 --> 29:48.880
So the killer must have driven here.
Forgot the case was in the car.

29:48.880 --> 29:51.080
She could have checked into a hotel,
left it there.

29:51.080 --> 29:55.160
No, look at her hair.
She colour-coordinates
her lipstick and her shoes.

29:55.160 --> 29:58.920
She'd never have left any hotel
with her hair still looking...

29:58.920 --> 30:00.400
Oh...

30:01.440 --> 30:02.840
Oh!

30:02.840 --> 30:04.480
Sherlock? What is it, what?

30:04.480 --> 30:08.200
Serial killers, always hard.
You have to wait for them
to make a mistake.

30:08.200 --> 30:11.360
We can't just wait! Oh, we're done
waiting. Look at her, really look!

30:11.360 --> 30:13.640
Houston, we have a mistake.
Get on to Cardiff.

30:13.640 --> 30:16.760
Find out who Jennifer Wilson's
family and friends were. Find Rachel!

30:16.760 --> 30:18.640
Of course, yeah - but what mistake?!

30:20.120 --> 30:21.760
Pink!

30:23.360 --> 30:25.600
ANDERSON: Let's get on with it...

31:03.120 --> 31:04.720
He's gone. Who, Sherlock Holmes?

31:04.720 --> 31:07.000
Yeah, he just took off.
He does that.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.080
Is he coming back?
Didn't look like it.

31:10.120 --> 31:12.040
Right.

31:13.040 --> 31:14.760
Right...

31:15.720 --> 31:17.720
Yes. Sorry, where am I?

31:18.720 --> 31:20.320
Brixton.

31:21.320 --> 31:23.200
Do you know where I could get a cab?

31:23.200 --> 31:25.440
It's just er...

31:25.440 --> 31:27.080
well -

31:27.080 --> 31:28.760
my leg.

31:28.760 --> 31:30.600
Er...

31:31.600 --> 31:33.720
..try the main road.

31:33.720 --> 31:34.880
Thanks.

31:34.880 --> 31:37.440
But you're not his friend.

31:37.440 --> 31:39.400
He doesn't HAVE friends.

31:40.760 --> 31:42.560
So who are you?

31:42.560 --> 31:45.440
I'm...I'm nobody. I just met him.

31:45.440 --> 31:47.440
OK, bit of advice then.
Stay away from that guy.

31:47.440 --> 31:49.440
Why?

31:51.360 --> 31:52.560
You know why he's here?

31:54.920 --> 31:56.840
He's not paid or anything.

31:56.840 --> 31:59.160
He likes it. He gets off on it.

32:00.160 --> 32:04.600
The weirder the crime, the more
he gets off. And you know what...?

32:04.600 --> 32:06.760
One day just showing up
won't be enough.

32:06.760 --> 32:10.040
One day we'll be standing
round a body and he'll be the one
that put it there.

32:10.040 --> 32:13.120
Why would he do that?
Because he's a psychopath.

32:13.120 --> 32:14.680
Psychopaths get bored.

32:15.720 --> 32:17.640
LESTRADE: Donovan! Coming.

32:21.480 --> 32:24.120
Stay away from Sherlock Holmes.

33:36.880 --> 33:38.360
'Do you see it?'

Who's this?

33:44.760 --> 33:46.120
Who's speaking?

33:46.120 --> 33:49.080
'Do you see the camera, Dr Watson?'

33:50.760 --> 33:52.400
Yeah, I see it. 'Watch...

33:57.680 --> 34:01.320

Hello. Hi.

34:49.920 --> 34:52.120
What's your name, then?

34:52.120 --> 34:53.840
Er...Anthea.

34:54.840 --> 34:57.680
Is that your real name? No.

35:01.840 --> 35:03.280
I'm John.

35:03.280 --> 35:04.960
Yes. I know.

35:08.760 --> 35:11.360
Any point in asking...
where I'm going?

35:14.200 --> 35:16.240
None at all...

35:16.240 --> 35:17.520
John.

35:18.760 --> 35:20.240
OK.

35:39.600 --> 35:41.040
Have a seat, John.

35:45.840 --> 35:47.440
You know, I've got a phone.

35:48.840 --> 35:51.480
I mean, very clever and all that,

35:51.480 --> 35:53.560
but er...

35:53.560 --> 35:55.240
you could just phone me.

35:56.240 --> 35:57.680
On my phone.

36:00.360 --> 36:05.480
When one is avoiding the attention
of Sherlock Holmes, one learns
to be discreet, hence this place.

36:05.480 --> 36:08.280
Your leg must be hurting you.
Sit down.

36:08.480 --> 36:10.760
I don't want to sit down.

36:11.760 --> 36:13.200
You don't seem very afraid.

36:13.200 --> 36:14.880
You don't seem very frightening.

36:14.880 --> 36:17.520
HE CHUCKLES
Yes...

36:17.520 --> 36:20.480
The bravery of the soldier.

36:20.480 --> 36:24.040
Bravery is by far the kindest
word for stupidity, don't you think?

36:24.040 --> 36:26.520
What is your connection
to Sherlock Holmes?

36:27.640 --> 36:33.160
I don't have one. I barely know him,
I met him...yesterday.

36:33.160 --> 36:37.480
Mmm, and since yesterday you've
moved in with him and now you're
solving crimes together.

36:37.480 --> 36:40.760
Might we expect a happy announcement
by the end of the week?

36:40.760 --> 36:43.280
Who are you? An interested party.

36:43.280 --> 36:45.240
Interested in Sherlock? Why?

36:45.240 --> 36:47.320
I'm guessing you're not friends.

36:47.320 --> 36:50.720
You've met him. How many friends
do you imagine he has?

36:51.800 --> 36:56.360
I am the closest thing to a friend
that Sherlock Holmes is capable of
having. And what's that?

36:56.360 --> 36:58.040
An enemy. An enemy?

36:58.040 --> 36:59.920
In HIS mind, certainly.

36:59.920 --> 37:03.560
If you were to ask him,
he'd probably say his arch-enemy.

37:03.560 --> 37:05.440
He does love to be dramatic.

37:05.440 --> 37:07.760
Well, thank God
YOU'RE above all that.

37:13.880 --> 37:16.040

37:17.000 --> 37:18.440
Not distracting me at all.

37:18.440 --> 37:21.560
Do you plan to continue your
association with Sherlock Holmes?

37:21.560 --> 37:22.840
I could be wrong...

37:22.840 --> 37:25.360
but I think that's
none of your business.

37:25.360 --> 37:28.080
It could be. It really couldn't.

37:29.200 --> 37:31.000
If you DO move into, erm...

37:33.440 --> 37:38.040
..221B Baker Street,

37:38.040 --> 37:39.280
I'd be happy to

37:39.280 --> 37:44.000
pay you a meaningful sum of money
on a regular basis to ease your way.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.320
Why?

37:45.320 --> 37:46.960
Because you're not a wealthy man.

37:46.960 --> 37:48.560
In exchange for what?

37:49.560 --> 37:51.280
Information.

37:51.280 --> 37:54.760
Nothing indiscreet. Nothing
you'd feel...uncomfortable with.

37:54.760 --> 37:57.520
Just tell me what he's up to. Why?

37:58.320 --> 38:02.000
I worry about him. Constantly.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.680
That's nice of you.

38:03.680 --> 38:08.120
But I would prefer
for various reasons
that my concern go unmentioned,

38:08.120 --> 38:12.360
we have what you might call a...
difficult relationship.

38:12.360 --> 38:13.600
TEXT MESSAGE ALERT

38:18.680 --> 38:21.200
No.
But I haven't mentioned a figure.

38:21.200 --> 38:22.920
Don't bother.

38:22.920 --> 38:24.960
You're very loyal VERY quickly.

38:24.960 --> 38:27.760
No, I'm not,
I'm just not interested.

38:32.080 --> 38:34.640
"Trust issues"...it says here.

38:38.160 --> 38:39.520
What's that?

38:39.520 --> 38:43.520
Could it be that you've decided to
trust Sherlock Holmes of all people?

38:43.520 --> 38:46.480
Who says I trust him? You don't seem
the kind to make friends easily.

38:46.480 --> 38:48.280
Are we done?

38:49.200 --> 38:50.320
You tell me.

38:57.480 --> 39:00.560
I imagine people have already
warned you to stay away from him,

39:00.560 --> 39:03.760
but I can see from your left hand
that's not going to happen.

39:06.640 --> 39:09.360
My what? Show me.

39:20.200 --> 39:21.280
Don't...

39:29.760 --> 39:31.800
Remarkable. What is?

39:31.800 --> 39:38.480
Most people...blunder round
this city, and all they see
are streets and shops and cars.

39:38.480 --> 39:41.320
When you walk with Sherlock
Holmes, you see the battlefield.

39:41.320 --> 39:43.720
You've seen it already. Haven't you?

39:43.720 --> 39:45.880
What's wrong with my hand?

39:45.880 --> 39:49.480
You have an intermittent tremor
in your left hand.

39:49.480 --> 39:52.560
Your therapist thinks it's
post-traumatic stress disorder.

39:52.560 --> 39:55.480
She thinks you're haunted by
memories of your military service.

39:55.480 --> 39:57.000
Who the hell are you?

39:58.320 --> 40:02.280
How do you know that? Fire her.
She's got it the wrong way round.

40:02.280 --> 40:05.960
You're under stress right now
and your hand is perfectly steady.

40:07.720 --> 40:10.640
You're not haunted by the war,
Dr Watson...

40:11.840 --> 40:13.120
You miss it.

40:15.680 --> 40:17.600
Welcome back.

40:22.200 --> 40:23.480
TEXT MESSAGE ALERT

40:23.480 --> 40:26.480
Time to choose a side, Dr Watson.

40:36.120 --> 40:38.320
I'm to take you home.

40:47.840 --> 40:49.200
Address?

40:49.200 --> 40:51.360
Er, Baker Street.

40:51.360 --> 40:54.080
221B Baker Street.

40:55.040 --> 40:57.600
But I need to stop off
somewhere first.

41:24.680 --> 41:29.080
Listen, your boss.
Any chance you could not tell him
this is where I went?

41:29.080 --> 41:31.640
Sure. You've told him
already, haven't you?

41:31.640 --> 41:33.080
Yeah.

41:36.840 --> 41:40.640
Hey erm...
do you ever get any free time?

41:40.640 --> 41:42.920
SHE CHUCKLES
Oh, yeah. Lots.

41:48.640 --> 41:50.720
Bye... OK.

42:12.520 --> 42:14.960
HE EXHALES SLOWLY

42:18.360 --> 42:19.560
What are you doing?

42:20.520 --> 42:22.160
Nicotine patch.

42:22.920 --> 42:24.600
Helps me think.

42:24.600 --> 42:28.360
Impossible to sustain a smoking
habit in London these days.

42:28.360 --> 42:30.120
Bad news for brain work.

42:30.120 --> 42:33.160
It's good news for breathing.
Oh... Breathing! Breathing's boring.

42:33.160 --> 42:34.960
Is that...three patches?

42:34.960 --> 42:36.760
It's a three-patch problem.

42:40.840 --> 42:42.120
Well...?

42:44.560 --> 42:47.080
You asked me to come,
I'm assuming it's important.

42:48.080 --> 42:50.240
Oh - yeah, of course.
Can I borrow your phone?

42:51.200 --> 42:55.120
My phone? Always a chance
that my number will be recognised.
It's on the website.

42:55.120 --> 42:57.080
Mrs Hudson's got a phone.
Yeah, she's downstairs.

42:57.080 --> 43:00.200
I tried shouting but she didn't hear.
I WAS the other side of London...

43:00.200 --> 43:02.000
There was no hurry.

43:04.640 --> 43:06.440
Here...

43:11.080 --> 43:13.320
So what's this about - the case?

43:13.320 --> 43:17.760
Her case... HER case?
Her suitcase, yes, obviously.

43:17.760 --> 43:21.240
The murderer took her suitcase,
first big mistake.

43:21.240 --> 43:22.880
OK, he took her case. So?

43:22.880 --> 43:26.080
It's no use, there's no other way.
We'll have to risk it.

43:27.200 --> 43:29.600
On my desk there's a number.
I want you to send a text.

43:31.800 --> 43:34.560
You've brought me here...
to send a text.

43:34.560 --> 43:36.080
Text, yes. The number on my desk.

43:48.160 --> 43:50.880
What's wrong?
Just met a friend of yours.

43:50.880 --> 43:52.840
A friend? An enemy.

43:52.840 --> 43:54.320
Oh. Which one?

43:55.960 --> 43:59.520
Well, your arch-enemy, according to
him. Do people have arch-enemies?

44:01.320 --> 44:03.240
Did he offer you money to spy on me?

44:04.240 --> 44:06.120
Yes. Did you take it?

44:06.120 --> 44:09.120
No. Pity, we could have split the
fee. Think it through next time.

44:10.520 --> 44:14.440
Who is he?
The most dangerous man you've ever
met, and not my problem right now.

44:14.440 --> 44:16.080
On my desk, the number!

44:22.920 --> 44:25.320
Jennifer Wilson. That was...

44:25.320 --> 44:27.520
Hang on. Wasn't that the dead woman?

44:27.520 --> 44:30.400
Yes. That's not important.
Just enter the number.

44:30.400 --> 44:32.840
Are you doing it? Yes.
Have you done it?

44:32.840 --> 44:35.280
Yeah - hang on!

44:35.280 --> 44:37.920
These words exactly.

44:37.920 --> 44:41.360
"What happened at Lauriston Gardens?

44:41.360 --> 44:43.160
"I must have blacked out.

44:43.160 --> 44:46.280
"22 Northumberland Street,

44:46.280 --> 44:47.840
please come." You blacked out?

44:47.840 --> 44:50.160
What? No... No!

44:51.120 --> 44:53.920
Type and send it. Quickly.

44:57.600 --> 45:00.000
Have you sent it? What's the address?

45:00.000 --> 45:02.360
22 Northumberland Street. Hurry up!

45:09.640 --> 45:10.920
That's...

45:11.960 --> 45:14.880
That's the pink lady's case,
that's Jennifer Wilson's case.

45:14.880 --> 45:16.240
Yes, obviously.

45:18.960 --> 45:22.960
Oh, perhaps I should mention -
I didn't kill her.
I never said you did.

45:22.960 --> 45:27.080
Why not? Given that text
and the fact I have her case
it's a perfectly logical assumption.

45:27.080 --> 45:29.360
Do people usually assume
you're the murderer?

45:30.640 --> 45:32.000
Now and then, yes.

45:33.360 --> 45:34.560
OK...

45:36.640 --> 45:38.800
How did you get this? By looking.

45:38.800 --> 45:41.640
Where? The killer must have
driven her to Lauriston Gardens.

45:41.640 --> 45:44.520
He could only keep her case
by accident if it was in the car.

45:44.520 --> 45:47.320
Nobody could be seen with this case
without drawing attention -

45:47.320 --> 45:50.240
particularly a man,
which is statistically more likely.

45:50.240 --> 45:52.840
So obviously he'd feel compelled
to get rid of it.

45:52.840 --> 45:55.960
Wouldn't have taken him more than
five minutes to realise his mistake.

45:55.960 --> 46:00.640
I checked every backstreet
wide enough for a car
five minutes from Lauriston Gardens,

46:00.640 --> 46:05.200
'and anywhere you could dispose of a
bulky object without being observed.

46:05.200 --> 46:08.480
'Took me less than an hour
to find the right skip.'

46:09.720 --> 46:12.680
Pink. You got all that because
you realised the case would be pink?

46:12.680 --> 46:15.000
It had to be pink, obviously.
Why didn't I think of that(?)

46:15.000 --> 46:16.600
Because you're an idiot.

46:16.600 --> 46:19.280
No, no, no, don't look like that.
Practically everyone is.

46:19.280 --> 46:22.000
Now, look. Do you see what's missing?

46:22.000 --> 46:23.200
From the case? How could I?

46:24.160 --> 46:25.960
Her phone. Where's her mobile phone?

46:25.960 --> 46:28.480
There was no phone on the body,
there's no phone in the case.

46:28.480 --> 46:30.000
We know she had one.
You just texted it.

46:30.000 --> 46:31.320
Maybe she left it at home.

46:31.320 --> 46:36.560
She has a string of lovers
and she's careful about it.
She never leaves her phone at home.

46:36.560 --> 46:38.200
Er...

46:39.160 --> 46:40.960
Why did I just send that text?

46:41.760 --> 46:44.360
Well, the question is
where is her phone NOW?

46:44.360 --> 46:46.960
She could have lost it. Yes, or?

46:48.480 --> 46:50.880
The murderer... You think
the murderer has the phone?

46:51.880 --> 46:57.160
Maybe she...left it
when she left her case. Maybe
he took it from her for some reason.

46:58.200 --> 47:01.600
Either way,
the balance of probability is
the murderer has her phone.

47:01.600 --> 47:06.160
Sorry...what are we doing -
did I just text a murderer?
What good will that do?

47:06.160 --> 47:07.440
TEXT MESSAGE ALERT

47:08.920 --> 47:11.240
A few hours after his last victim,

47:11.240 --> 47:14.640
and now he receives a text
that can only be from her.

47:16.240 --> 47:21.640
If somebody had just found that phone
they'd ignore a text like that,
but the murderer...

47:21.640 --> 47:23.320
would panic.

47:25.440 --> 47:28.520
Have you talked to the police? Four
people are dead, there isn't time.

47:28.520 --> 47:30.240
So why are you talking to ME?

47:30.240 --> 47:32.000
Mrs Hudson took my skull.

47:33.080 --> 47:35.160
So I'm basically filling in
for your skull?

47:35.160 --> 47:37.440
Relax, you're doing fine.

47:37.440 --> 47:41.720
Well? Well, what? Well - you could
just sit there and...watch telly.

47:41.720 --> 47:46.400
What, you want me to come with you?
I like company when I go out,
and I think better when I talk aloud.

47:46.400 --> 47:48.800
The skull just
attracts attention, so...

47:48.800 --> 47:51.240
Problem? Yeah, Sergeant Donovan.

47:51.240 --> 47:53.080
What about her?

47:53.080 --> 47:54.160
She said...

47:54.160 --> 47:56.400
you get off on this. You enjoy it.

47:57.480 --> 48:01.000
And I said "dangerous",
and here you are.

48:04.720 --> 48:06.120
Damn it!

48:15.080 --> 48:18.520
Where are we going?
Northumberland Street's
a five-minute walk from here.

48:18.520 --> 48:22.080
You think he's stupid enough
to go there?
No - I think he's brilliant enough.

48:22.080 --> 48:25.040
I love the brilliant ones. They're
all so desperate to get caught.

48:25.040 --> 48:27.280
Why? Appreciation!

48:27.280 --> 48:29.960
Applause! At long last the spotlight.

48:29.960 --> 48:33.680
That's the frailty of genius, John,
it needs an audience. Yeah.

48:33.680 --> 48:38.000
This is his hunting ground.
Right here in the heart of the city.

48:38.000 --> 48:41.360
Now that we know his victims were
abducted, that changes everything.

48:41.360 --> 48:44.320
Because all of his victims
disappeared from busy streets,

48:44.320 --> 48:46.360
crowded places,
but nobody saw them go.

48:47.960 --> 48:50.680
Think! Who do we trust,
even though we don't know them?

48:50.680 --> 48:54.040
Who passes unnoticed
wherever they go?

48:54.040 --> 48:56.360
Who hunts in the middle of a crowd?

48:56.360 --> 48:58.480
Don't know. Who?

48:58.480 --> 49:00.440
Haven't the faintest. Hungry?

49:04.280 --> 49:05.680
Thank you, Billy.

49:10.080 --> 49:11.840
22 Northumberland Street.

49:11.840 --> 49:14.120
Keep your eyes on it.

49:14.120 --> 49:17.080
He's not just going to ring
the doorbell. He'd need to be mad.

49:17.080 --> 49:19.600
He HAS killed four people.

49:19.600 --> 49:21.120
OK.

49:22.720 --> 49:24.320
Sherlock!

49:24.320 --> 49:26.880
Anything on the menu,
whatever you want, free.

49:26.880 --> 49:29.160
On the house, for you
and for your date.

49:29.160 --> 49:30.880
Do you want to eat? I'm not his date.

49:30.880 --> 49:33.080
This man got me off a murder charge.

49:33.080 --> 49:38.600
This is Angelo. Three years ago
I proved to Lestrade at the time of
a particularly vicious triple murder

49:38.600 --> 49:40.680
that Angelo was elsewhere,
house-breaking.

49:40.680 --> 49:44.400
He cleared my name. I cleared it
a bit. Anything happening opposite?

49:44.400 --> 49:45.600
Nothing.

49:45.600 --> 49:48.400
But for this man, I'd have gone
to prison. You did go to prison.

49:48.400 --> 49:51.120
I'll get a candle for the table.
It's more romantic.

49:51.120 --> 49:52.640
I'm not his date!

49:54.560 --> 49:57.520
You may as well eat.
We might have a long wait.

49:58.560 --> 50:00.040
Thanks.

50:07.240 --> 50:09.160
People don't have arch-enemies.

50:10.200 --> 50:12.160
I'm sorry? In real life.

50:13.200 --> 50:15.560
There are no arch-enemies
in real life. Doesn't happen.

50:15.560 --> 50:17.920
Doesn't it? Sounds a bit dull.

50:17.920 --> 50:19.920
So who did I meet?

50:19.920 --> 50:23.760
What do real people have, then,
in their..."real lives"?

50:24.760 --> 50:26.240
Friends?

50:26.240 --> 50:30.480
People they know, people they like,
people they don't like...

50:30.480 --> 50:34.360
Girlfriends, boyfriends.
Yes, well, as I was saying - dull.

50:34.360 --> 50:36.960
You don't have a girlfriend, then.

50:36.960 --> 50:39.040
Girlfriend? No, not really my area.

50:39.040 --> 50:40.480
Mm.

50:41.440 --> 50:43.080
Oh, right.

50:44.080 --> 50:46.680
Do you have a...boyfriend?
Which is fine, by the way.

50:46.680 --> 50:48.760
I know it's fine.

50:49.920 --> 50:51.600
So you've got a boyfriend then. No.

50:51.600 --> 50:53.440
Right. OK.

50:55.880 --> 50:57.640
You're unattached. Like me.

50:58.640 --> 51:01.400
Fine. Good.

51:08.560 --> 51:10.280
John, erm...

51:10.280 --> 51:13.040
I think you should know that
I consider myself married to my work,

51:13.040 --> 51:16.360
and while I'm flattered,
I'm really not looking for any... No,

51:16.360 --> 51:19.120
I'm...not asking. No.

51:20.040 --> 51:23.080
I'm just saying, it's all fine.

51:24.120 --> 51:26.520
TAXI OUTSIDE
Good.

51:28.200 --> 51:29.400
Thank you.

51:31.040 --> 51:34.520
Look across the street.
Taxi. It's stopped.

51:34.520 --> 51:36.440
Nobody getting in,
and nobody getting out.

51:37.440 --> 51:38.760
Why a taxi?

51:39.760 --> 51:42.480
Oh, that's clever. Is it clever?
Why is it clever? That's him.

51:43.400 --> 51:44.640
Don't stare.

51:44.640 --> 51:46.680
You're staring. We can't both stare.

52:08.400 --> 52:10.040
CAR HORN

52:11.160 --> 52:12.640
Sorry...

52:13.720 --> 52:15.400
I've got the cab number.
Good for you.

52:16.400 --> 52:19.240
Right turn, one way, roadworks,
traffic lights, bus lane,

52:19.240 --> 52:21.640
pedestrian crossing, left turn only,
traffic lights.

52:26.920 --> 52:28.040
Sorry.

52:31.960 --> 52:33.160
TYRES SQUEAL

52:38.240 --> 52:39.680
Come on, John...

52:58.360 --> 53:00.600
Come on, John. We're losing him!

53:29.600 --> 53:31.120
This way.

53:32.120 --> 53:33.320
No - THIS way!

53:33.320 --> 53:35.120
Sorry...

54:00.520 --> 54:02.960
Police! Open her up.

54:04.880 --> 54:07.240
SHERLOCK PANTS
No...

54:07.240 --> 54:09.440
Teeth, tan. What - Californian...?

54:10.480 --> 54:13.240
LA, Santa Monica. Just arrived.

54:13.240 --> 54:15.160
How could you possibly know that?
The luggage.

54:17.360 --> 54:19.600
Probably your first trip
to London, right?

54:19.600 --> 54:22.040
Going by your final destination
and the cabbie's route.

54:22.040 --> 54:24.080
Sorry - are you guys the police?

54:24.080 --> 54:26.440
Yeah. Everything all right?

54:26.440 --> 54:28.320
Yeah.

54:29.800 --> 54:31.400
Welcome to London.

54:33.320 --> 54:35.480
Er, any problems - just let us know.

54:39.720 --> 54:42.720
Basically just a cab that
happened to slow down. Basically.

54:42.720 --> 54:44.760
Not the murderer.
Not the murderer, no.

54:44.760 --> 54:46.800
Wrong country, good alibi.

54:46.800 --> 54:48.960
As they go.
Hey, where did you get this?

54:50.120 --> 54:52.200
Detective Inspector Lestrade? Yeah.

54:52.200 --> 54:54.080
I pickpocket him when he's annoying.

54:54.080 --> 54:56.600
You can keep that one,
I've got plenty at the flat.

54:59.600 --> 55:02.360
What?
Nothing, just..."Welcome to London".

55:02.360 --> 55:04.480
HE SNIGGERS

55:06.120 --> 55:08.960
Got your breath back?
Ready when you are.

55:14.960 --> 55:17.120
JOHN PANTS
OK...

55:18.160 --> 55:19.880
That was ridiculous.

55:19.880 --> 55:23.400
That was the most
ridiculous thing...I've ever done.

55:23.400 --> 55:26.760
And you invaded Afghanistan.
THEY LAUGH

55:27.920 --> 55:29.680
That wasn't just me.

55:29.680 --> 55:31.320
Why aren't we back
at the restaurant?

55:31.320 --> 55:33.560
They can keep an eye out.

55:33.560 --> 55:35.560
It was a long shot anyway.

55:35.560 --> 55:37.480
So what were we doing there?

55:40.640 --> 55:42.040
Oh, just passing the time.

55:43.080 --> 55:44.800
And proving a point.

55:44.800 --> 55:46.360
What point? You.

55:46.360 --> 55:50.400
Mrs Hudson! Dr Watson
WILL take the room upstairs.

55:50.400 --> 55:51.880
Says who?

55:51.880 --> 55:53.480
Says the man at the door.

55:53.480 --> 55:54.800
KNOCKING

56:04.280 --> 56:08.360
Sherlock texted me.
He said you forgot this.

56:09.320 --> 56:10.800
Ah...

56:12.080 --> 56:13.560
Er, thank you.

56:13.560 --> 56:14.760
Thank you.

56:15.880 --> 56:17.800
Sherlock, what have you done?

56:17.800 --> 56:19.920
Mrs Hudson? Upstairs.

56:25.920 --> 56:28.880
What are you doing? Well, I knew
you'd find the case, I'm not stupid.

56:28.880 --> 56:33.080
You can't just break into my flat.
You can't withhold evidence -
and I didn't break in.

56:33.080 --> 56:35.440
Well, what do you call this then?

56:35.440 --> 56:39.120
It's a drugs bust.
Seriously? This guy - a junkie?

56:39.120 --> 56:41.200
Have you met him? John...

56:41.200 --> 56:45.440
You could search this flat all day,
you wouldn't find anything
you could call recreational.

56:45.440 --> 56:47.680
John, you probably want to
shut up now. But come on...

56:49.640 --> 56:51.360
No... What?

56:51.360 --> 56:54.400
You?
Shut up! I'm not your sniffer dog.

56:54.400 --> 56:56.640
No, Anderson's my sniffer dog.

56:58.040 --> 57:00.440
Anderson, what are YOU doing here
on a drugs bust?

57:00.440 --> 57:05.240
Oh, I volunteered. They all did.
They're not strictly speaking ON the
drug squad, but they're very keen.

57:05.240 --> 57:07.200
Are these human eyes?
Put those back!

57:07.200 --> 57:09.640
They were in the microwave.
It's an experiment.

57:09.640 --> 57:11.080
Keep looking, guys.

57:11.080 --> 57:13.360
Or you could help us properly
and I'll stand them down.

57:13.360 --> 57:15.560
This is childish.
Well, I'm dealing with a child.

57:15.560 --> 57:19.600
Sherlock, this is our case.
I'm letting you in,
but you do not go off on your own.

57:19.600 --> 57:23.680
Clear? What - so you set up
a pretend drugs bust to bully me?

57:23.680 --> 57:27.080
It stops being pretend
if we find anything. I am clean!

57:27.080 --> 57:28.920
Is your flat...? All of it?

57:28.920 --> 57:31.560
Don't even smoke.

57:31.560 --> 57:33.760
Neither do I.

57:35.160 --> 57:36.920
So let's work together.

57:37.960 --> 57:39.680
We've found Rachel. Who is she?

57:39.680 --> 57:41.320
Jennifer Wilson's only daughter.

57:41.320 --> 57:43.280
Her daughter?

57:43.280 --> 57:45.840
Why would she write
her daughter's name? Why?

57:45.840 --> 57:48.280
Never mind that, we found the case.

57:48.280 --> 57:53.080
According to SOMEONE the murderer
has the case, and we found it in the
hands of our favourite psychopath.

57:53.080 --> 57:56.280
I'm a high-functioning sociopath.
Do your research.

57:56.280 --> 57:58.960
You need to bring Rachel in
and I need to question her.

57:58.960 --> 58:02.960
She's dead. Excellent.
How, when and why? Is there
a connection? There has to be.

58:02.960 --> 58:07.120
Well, I doubt it,
since she's been dead for 14 years.
Technically she was never alive.

58:07.120 --> 58:12.240
Rachel was Jennifer Wilson's
stillborn daughter, 14 years ago.

58:12.240 --> 58:13.600
No, that's...

58:14.600 --> 58:16.480
..that's not right. How...

58:16.480 --> 58:18.400
Why would she do that? Why?

58:18.400 --> 58:22.560
Why would she think of her daughter
in her last moments? Yup -
sociopath, I'm seeing it now.

58:22.560 --> 58:24.600
She didn't think about her daughter.

58:24.600 --> 58:28.320
She scratched her name on the floor
with her fingernails. She was dying.

58:28.320 --> 58:30.120
It took effort, it would have hurt.

58:31.160 --> 58:35.640
You said that the victims
all took the poison themselves,
that he MAKES them take it -

58:35.640 --> 58:40.720
well, maybe he...I don't know,
talks to them. Maybe he used
the death of her daughter somehow.

58:40.720 --> 58:44.040
Yeah, but that was ages ago.
Why would she still be upset?

58:47.200 --> 58:49.200
Not good?

58:49.200 --> 58:50.320
Bit not good, yeah.

58:50.320 --> 58:54.680
If you were dying...
If you'd been murdered - in your very
last few seconds what would you say?

58:54.680 --> 58:57.560
"Please, God, let me live."
Use your imagination!

58:57.560 --> 58:59.080
I don't have to.

59:00.400 --> 59:04.600
Yeah, but if you were clever...
Jennifer Wilson running
all those lovers - she WAS clever.

59:04.600 --> 59:06.440
She's trying to tell us something.

59:06.440 --> 59:09.120
Isn't the doorbell working?
Your taxi's here, Sherlock.

59:09.120 --> 59:13.640
I didn't order a taxi. Go away.
Oh, dear. They're making such
a mess. What are they looking for?

59:13.640 --> 59:15.360
It's a drugs bust, Mrs Hudson.

59:15.360 --> 59:18.480
But they're just for my hip.
They're herbal soothers...

59:18.480 --> 59:21.600
Shut up, everybody! Don't speak,
don't breathe. I'm trying to think.

59:21.600 --> 59:23.880
Anderson, face the other way.
You're putting me off.

59:23.880 --> 59:26.440
What? My FACE is(?)
Everybody quiet and still.

59:26.440 --> 59:28.720
Anderson, turn your back.
Oh, for God's sake!

59:28.720 --> 59:30.400
Your back, now, please!

59:30.400 --> 59:32.400
Come on, think. Quick!
What about your taxi?

59:32.400 --> 59:33.640
MRS HUDSON!

59:36.360 --> 59:38.080
Oh...

59:38.080 --> 59:40.320
Ah!

59:40.320 --> 59:43.880
She was clever. Clever, yes!

59:43.880 --> 59:48.320
She's cleverer than you lot and she's
dead. Do you see, do you get it?

59:48.320 --> 59:51.920
She didn't lose her phone, she
never lost it. She PLANTED it on him.

59:51.920 --> 59:54.960
When she got out of the car, she
knew that she was going to her death.

59:54.960 --> 59:59.080
She left the phone in order to
lead us to her killer. But how?

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:01.960
What do you mean, how?

01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:03.560
Rachel!

01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:06.480
Don't you see? Rachel!

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:10.600
Oh...

01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:12.280
Look at you lot.
You're all so vacant.

01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:15.080
Is it nice not being me?
It must be so relaxing.

01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:16.240
Rachel is not a name.

01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:19.120
Then what is it? John -
on the luggage, there's a label.

01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:21.200
E-mail address.

01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:26.080
Er, jennie.pink@mephone.org.uk.

01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:31.360
She didn't have a laptop, which means
she did her business on her phone.
A smartphone, it's e-mail enabled.

01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:33.000
So there was a website
for her account.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:36.160
The username is her e-mail address -
and all together, the password is?

01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:39.440
Rachel.
So we can read her e-mails. So what?

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:42.440
Anderson, don't talk out loud.
You lower the IQ of the whole street.

01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:45.240
We can do much more than that.
It's a smartphone, it's got GPS.

01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:50.040
Which means if you lose it you can
locate it online. She's leading us
directly to the man who killed her.

01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:52.160
Unless he got rid of it.
We know he didn't.

01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:56.680
Come on, come on. Quickly!
Sherlock, dear. This taxi driver...

01:00:56.680 --> 01:00:59.360
Mrs Hudson, isn't it time
for your evening soother?

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:03.440
Get vehicles, get a helicopter. This
phone battery won't last for ever.

01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:06.600
We'll just have a map reference,
not a name. It's a start!

01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:09.120
Sherlock... Narrows it down
from just anyone in London.

01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:11.600
It's the first proper lead
that we've had. Sherlock...

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:14.040
Where is it? Quickly, where?

01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:17.040
Here. It's...in 221 Baker Street.

01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:20.880
How can it be here?

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:22.280
How?

01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:25.800
Maybe it was in the case
when you brought it back
and it...fell out somewhere.

01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:29.400
What, and I didn't notice it?
Me - I didn't notice?

01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:31.200
Anyway, we texted him
and he called back.

01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:34.240
Guys, we're also looking
for a mobile somewhere here,

01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:37.360
belonged to the victim... 'Who do we
trust, even if we don't know them?

01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:50.120
'Who passes unnoticed
wherever they go?

01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:57.120
'Who hunts in the middle of a crowd?'

01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:27.920
TEXT MESSAGE ALERT

01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:38.120
Sherlock, you OK? What...?

01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:40.360
Yeah, yeah... I'm fine.

01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:42.320
So, how can the phone be here?

01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:43.560
Don't know.

01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:45.640
I'll try it again. Good idea.

01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:47.320
Where are you going?

01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:50.800
Fresh air, just popping outside
for a moment. Won't be long.

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:52.920
You sure you're all right? I'm fine.

01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:04.800
Taxi for Sherlock Holmes.

01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:10.280
I didn't order a taxi.

01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:12.400
Doesn't mean you don't need one.

01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:15.280
You're the cabbie.

01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:19.200
The one who stopped outside
Northumberland Street.

01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:26.440
It was you. Not your passenger.

01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:29.600
See?
No-one ever thinks about the cabbie.

01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:31.600
It's like you're invisible.

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:33.400
Just the back of an 'ead.

01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:37.080
Proper advantage
for a serial killer.

01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:41.400
Is this a confession? Oh, yeah.

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:44.680
I'll tell you what else...

01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:46.720
If you call the coppers now,
I won't run.

01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:51.520
I'll sit quiet and they can
take me down, I promise.

01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:52.840
Why?

01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:55.800
Cos you're not going to do that.
Am I not?

01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:00.640
I didn't kill those four people,
Mr Holmes.

01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:02.800
I spoke to 'em...

01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:04.880
and they killed themselves.

01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:09.600
If you get the coppers now,
I'll promise you one thing.

01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:13.320
I will never tell you what I said.

01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:22.120
No-one else will die, though, and
I believe they call that a result.

01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:26.120
And you won't ever understand
how those people died.

01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:29.480
What kind of result
do you care about?

01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:47.240
If I wanted to understand...

01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:51.120
..what would I do?
Let me take you for a ride.

01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:54.880
So you can kill me too?
I don't want to kill you, Mr Holmes.

01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:58.040
I'm going to talk to ya...

01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:02.680
..and then you're
going to kill yourself.

01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:15.000
DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.440
ENGINE STARTS

01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:23.680
He just got in a cab...
It's Sherlock.
He just drove off in a cab.

01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:25.280
I told you, he does that.

01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:26.800
He bloody left again.

01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:28.520
We're wasting our time!

01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:30.920
I'm...calling the phone,
it's ringing out.

01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:33.800
PHONE RINGS

01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:38.640
PHONE KEEPS RINGING

01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:42.840
PHONE KEEPS RINGING

01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:44.640
And if it's ringing, it's not here.

01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:48.560
I'll try the search again.
Does it matter? Does any of it?

01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:54.360
He's just a lunatic, and he'll
always let you down. And you're
wasting your time. All our time.

01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:02.840
OK, everybody...

01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:04.360
done here.

01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:08.480
How did you find me?

01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:10.320
Oh, I recognised ya.

01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:13.880
Soon as I saw you chasing my cab.

01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:17.000
Sherlock Holmes!

01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:19.480
I was warned about you.

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:24.360
I've been on your website, too.
Brilliant stuff! Loved it.

01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:28.000
Who warned you about me? Just
someone out there who's noticed.

01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:31.200
Who?

01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:40.040
Who would notice me?

01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:43.240
You're too modest, Mr Holmes.
I'm really not.

01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:45.520
Got yourself a fan.

01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:48.200
Tell me more.

01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:49.880
That's all you're going to know.

01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:53.000
In THIS lifetime.

01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:56.520
Why did he do that?
Why did he have to leave?

01:06:56.520 --> 01:06:58.880
You know him better than I do.

01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:02.120
I've known him for five years -
and no, I don't.

01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:05.240
So why do you put up with him?

01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:08.200
Because I'm desperate, that's why.

01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:12.920
And because Sherlock Holmes
is a great man -

01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:16.680
and I think one day,
if we're very, very lucky,

01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:18.880
he might even be a good one.

01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:41.240
Where are we?

01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:45.600
You know every street in London.
You know exactly where we are.

01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:48.600
Roland-Kerr
Further Education College.

01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:51.560
Why here? It's open.

01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:53.440
Cleaners are in.

01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:57.640
One thing about being a cabbie -
you always know
a nice quiet spot for a murder.

01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:00.720
I'm surprised more of us
don't branch out.

01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:03.680
And you just walk your victims in?
How?

01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:07.320
Oh... Dull.

01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:08.880
Don't worry. It gets better.

01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:14.240
You can't make people take
their own lives at gunpoint. I don't.

01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:17.040
It's much better than that.

01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:20.120
Don't need this with you.
Cos you'll follow me.

01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:45.560
BEEP

01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:47.880
CONTINUED BEEPING

01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:14.040
Well, what do you think?

01:09:15.479 --> 01:09:17.240
It's up to you.

01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:19.080
You're the one
who's going to die here.

01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:24.040
No, I'm not.
That's what they all say.

01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:27.760
Shall we talk?

01:09:42.399 --> 01:09:44.040
Bit risky, wasn't it?

01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:48.080
Took me away under the eye of
about half a dozen policemen.

01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:50.399
They're not that stupid.

01:09:50.399 --> 01:09:52.600
And Mrs Hudson will remember you.

01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:55.560
You call that a risk? Nah...

01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:57.600
THIS is a risk.

01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:07.960
Oh, I like this bit.

01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:09.800
Cos you don't get it yet, do ya?

01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:13.840
But you're about to.

01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:16.520
I just have to do this...

01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:24.320
Weren't expecting that, were ya?

01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:27.040
Oh, you're going to love this.

01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:30.720
Love what?
Sherlock Holmes! Look at you!

01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:37.240
Here in the flesh. That website
of yours, your fan told me about it.

01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:38.920
My fan?

01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:41.520
You are brilliant.

01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:43.920
You are a proper genius.

01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:47.920
The Science of Deduction.
Now, that...

01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:50.000
is proper thinking.

01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:54.200
Between you and me sitting here,
why can't people think?

01:10:56.120 --> 01:10:58.160
Don't it make you mad?

01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:01.920
Why can't people just think?

01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:09.320
Oh, I see...
So you're a proper genius too.

01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:11.520
Don't look it, do I?

01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:14.600
Funny little man driving a cab.

01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:17.840
But you'll know better in a minute.

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:20.840
Chances are it'll be
the last thing you EVER know.

01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:24.320
OK, two bottles. Explain.

01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:28.520
There's a good bottle
and a bad bottle.

01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:31.120
You take the pill from
the good bottle, you live.

01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:35.280
You take the pill from
the bad bottle...you die.

01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:37.920
Both bottles are of course identical.
In every way.

01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:40.880
And you know which is which.
Of course I know. But I don't.

01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:43.720
Wouldn't be a game if you knew.
You're the one who chooses.

01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:47.720
Why should I? I've got nothing
to go on. What's in it for me?

01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:50.520
I haven't told you the best bit yet.

01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:53.720
Whatever bottle YOU choose,

01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:55.400
I take the pill from the other one.

01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:57.840
And then together...

01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:00.320
we take our medicine.

01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:05.400
I won't cheat. It's your choice.

01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:08.800
I'll take whatever pill you don't.

01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:14.120
Didn't expect that,
did you, Mr Holmes?

01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:16.680
This is what you did
to the rest of them -

01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:19.080
you gave them a choice?
And now I'm giving you one.

01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:22.640
You take your time.

01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:24.520
Get yourself together.

01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:28.480
I want your best game.
It's not a game, it's chance.

01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:31.200
I've played four times. I'm alive.

01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:35.080
It's not chance, Mr Holmes,
it's chess.

01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:38.680
It's a game of chess,

01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:42.360
with one move...and one survivor.

01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:46.200
And this - this...

01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:47.960
is the move.

01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:59.600
Did I just give you the good bottle
or the bad bottle?

01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:01.840
You can choose either one.

01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:08.360
No, Detective Inspector Lestrade -
I need to speak to him.

01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:10.120
It's important. It's an emergency.

01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:12.400
Er, left here, please. Left here...

01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:26.480
You ready yet, Mr Holmes?

01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:30.280
Ready to play? Play what?
It's a 50:50 chance.

01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:32.920
You're not playing the numbers,
you're playing ME.

01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:38.000
Did I just give you the good pill
or the bad pill?

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.120
Is it a bluff,

01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:42.200
or a double bluff?

01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:44.320
Or a triple bluff?
It's still just chance.

01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:46.320
Four people, in a row?
It's not chance.

01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:48.000
Luck. It's genius!

01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:52.200
I know how people think.

01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:54.160
I know how people think I think.

01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:57.600
I can see it all
like a map inside my head.

01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:01.920
Everyone's so stupid, even you.

01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:03.600
Or maybe God just loves me.

01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:09.800
Either way,
you're wasted as a cabbie.

01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:20.040
So...

01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:25.120
You risked your life four times
just to kill strangers? Why?

01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:26.680
Time to play.

01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:29.200
Oh, I am playing.

01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:30.400
This is my turn.

01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:35.920
There's shaving foam behind your left
ear. Nobody's pointed it out to you.

01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:40.680
Traces of where it's happened before,
so obviously you live on your own -
there's no-one to tell you.

01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:43.600
But there's a photograph of children.
Their mother's been cut out.

01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:45.320
If she'd died, she'd still be there.

01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:47.280
The photograph's old,
but the frame's new.

01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:49.680
You think of your children,
but you don't get to see them.

01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:52.000
Estranged father.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:53.920
She took the kids,

01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:57.360
but you still love them
and it still hurts.

01:14:58.400 --> 01:14:59.640
Ah, but there's more.

01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:03.680
Your clothes. Recently laundered,

01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:06.400
but everything you're wearing
is at least...three years old?

01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:10.320
Keeping up appearances,
but not planning ahead.

01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:15.320
And here you are on a kamikaze
murder spree. What's that about?

01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:21.640
Ah...

01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:23.840
Three years ago.
Is that when they told you?

01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:26.200
Told me what?

01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:28.280
That you're a dead man walking.
So are you.

01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:29.920
You don't have long, though.

01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:32.040
Am I right?

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.400
Aneurism. Right in 'ere.

01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:41.280
Any breath could be my last.

01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:44.760
And because you're dying,
you've just murdered four people.

01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:46.640
I've outlived four people.

01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:51.040
That's the most fun you can have
with an aneurism.

01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:55.760
No... No, there's something else.

01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:59.760
You didn't just kill four people
because you're bitter.
Bitterness is a paralytic.

01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:03.760
Love
is a much more vicious motivator.

01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:08.400
Somehow, this is about your children.

01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:09.800
Oh...

01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:14.280
You ARE good, in't ya? But how?

01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:18.520
When I die they won't get much,
my kids.

01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:22.880
Not a lot of money in driving cabs.

01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:25.240
Or serial killing.
You'd be surprised.

01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:26.880
Surprise me.

01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:31.640
I have a sponsor.

01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:35.920
You have a what? For every life
I take, money goes to my kids.

01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:39.360
The more I kill...
the better off they'll be.

01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:43.440
You see? It's nicer than you think.

01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:45.400
Who'd sponsor a serial killer?

01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:48.040
Who'd be a fan of Sherlock Holmes?

01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:54.440
You're not the only one
to enjoy a good murder.

01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:58.600
There's others out there just
like you, except you're just a man.

01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:02.200
And they're so much more than that.

01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:05.760
What do you mean...

01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:07.800
more than a man?

01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:10.920
An organisation...? What?

01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:15.160
There's a name, that no-one says.

01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:16.960
And I'm not going to say it either.

01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:20.760
Now, enough chatter.

01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:24.480
Time to choose.

01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:30.760
Sherlock?!

01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:36.920
Sherlock!

01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:40.360
What if I don't choose either?
I could just walk out of here.

01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:46.360
You can take a 50:50 chance,

01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:49.320
or I can shoot you in the head.

01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:52.320
Funnily enough,

01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:54.320
no-one's ever gone for that option.

01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:56.360
I'll have the gun, please.

01:17:57.680 --> 01:17:59.040
Are you sure?

01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:02.840
Definitely. The gun.

01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:04.880
You don't want to phone a friend(?)

01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:08.240
The gun.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:14.920
I know a real gun when I see one.

01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:19.120
None of the others did. Clearly.

01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:23.560
Well, this has been very interesting.

01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:26.040
I look forward to the court case.

01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:31.920
Just before you go,
did you figure it out?

01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:35.480
Which one's the good bottle?

01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:37.640
Course. Child's play.

01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:39.920
Well, which one, then?

01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:42.880
Which one would you have picked?

01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:46.000
Just so I know whether
I could have beaten you.

01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:49.080
Come on!

01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:50.880
Play the game.

01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:05.840
Oh!

01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:09.240
Interesting.

01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:19.040
So what do you think?

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.080
Shall we?

01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:25.920
Really... What do you think?

01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:29.760
Can you beat me?

01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:34.040
Are you clever enough...

01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:36.920
..to bet your life?

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:50.240
FAINTLY: SHERLOCK!

01:19:52.040 --> 01:19:54.560
I bet you get bored, don't you?

01:19:55.720 --> 01:19:57.480
I know you do.

01:19:57.480 --> 01:20:01.200
A man like you. So clever.

01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:06.600
But what's the point of being clever
if you can't prove it?

01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:09.400
Still the addict.

01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:14.720
But this...this is what
you're really addicted to.

01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:18.120
You'll do anything...

01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:23.320
..anything at all,
to stop being bored.

01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:27.080
You're not bored now, are ya?

01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:29.400
Isn't it good?

01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:30.520
GUNSHOT

01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:43.360
CABBIE GASPS

01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:46.160
Was I right?

01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:48.000
I was, wasn't I?

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:49.400
Did I get it right?!

01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:56.120
OK... Tell me this.

01:20:57.360 --> 01:20:59.960
Your sponsor. Who was it?

01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:02.040
The one who told you about me,
my fan.

01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:03.880
I want a name.

01:21:03.880 --> 01:21:05.400
No...

01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:08.520
You're dying,
but there's still time to hurt you.

01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:11.160
Give me...a name.

01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:12.880
HE GASPS

01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:16.640
A name! Now.

01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:19.920
The name!

01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:23.600
HE GASPS
MORIARTY!

01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:39.440
SIRENS WAIL

01:21:44.680 --> 01:21:48.240
Why have I got this blanket?
They keep putting this blanket on me.

01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:49.960
Yeah, it's for shock.
I'm not in shock.

01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:52.640
Yeah, but some of the guys
want to take photographs.

01:21:54.440 --> 01:21:56.040
So, the shooter. No sign?

01:21:56.040 --> 01:22:00.160
Cleared off before we got here.
But a guy like that
would have had enemies, I suppose.

01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:03.360
One of them could have
been following him, but...

01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:05.440
we've got nothing to go on.

01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:07.040
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

01:22:08.640 --> 01:22:10.200
OK. Give me.

01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:13.200
The bullet they just dug
out of the wall's from a handgun.

01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:17.760
A kill shot over that distance,
that's a crack shot.
But not just a marksman, a fighter.

01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:21.400
His hands couldn't have shaken at all
so clearly he's acclimatised
to violence.

01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:25.280
He didn't fire until I was
in immediate danger though,
so strong moral principle.

01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:29.360
You're looking for a man
probably with a history
of military service, and...

01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:30.640
nerves of steel...

01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:40.680
Actually, do you know what?
Ignore me. Sorry? Ignore all of that.

01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:43.400
It's just the er...the shock talking.

01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:46.280
Where are you going? I just
need to...talk about the rent.

01:22:46.280 --> 01:22:49.680
I've still got questions.
What now? I'm in shock -
look, I've got a blanket.

01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:54.920
Sherlock! And, I just caught you
a serial killer... More or less.

01:22:57.600 --> 01:23:00.920
OK. We'll pull you in tomorrow,
off you go.

01:23:08.600 --> 01:23:12.200
Erm - Sergeant Donovan has...
just been explaining everything.

01:23:12.200 --> 01:23:14.240
The two pills...

01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:17.240
Dreadful business, isn't it?
Dreadful.

01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:19.440
Good shot.

01:23:20.680 --> 01:23:23.720
Yes. Yes, must have been. Through
that window. Well, you'd know.

01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:28.200
Need to get the powder burns
out of your fingers.

01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:32.320
I don't suppose you'd serve time for
this, but let's avoid the court case.

01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:35.080
Are you all right?
Yes, of course I'm all right.

01:23:35.080 --> 01:23:36.760
Well, you have just killed a man.
Yes...

01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:41.840
That's true, isn't it?

01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:45.120
But he wasn't a very nice man.

01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:50.560
No. No, he wasn't, really, was he?
Frankly a bloody awful cabbie.

01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:53.520
SHERLOCK CHUCKLES
That's true, he was a bad cabbie.

01:23:53.520 --> 01:23:56.280
You should have seen
the route he took us to get here.

01:23:56.280 --> 01:23:59.000
Stop it! We can't giggle,
it's a crime scene. Stop it.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.480
Well, you're the one who shot him.
Keep your voice down.

01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:05.040
Sorry, it's just erm...
nerves, I think. Sorry.

01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:09.360
You were going to take that damn
pill, weren't you? Course I wasn't.

01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:12.360
Biding my time. Knew you'd turn up.

01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:14.000
No, you didn't.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:17.720
That's how you get your kicks,
isn't it - you risk your life
to prove you're clever.

01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:20.680
Why would I do that?
Because you're an idiot.

01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:24.840
Dinner? Starving.

01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:27.600
End of Baker Street there's
a good Chinese. Stays open till two.

01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:30.160
You can tell a good Chinese by the
bottom third of the door handle.

01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:34.120
Sherlock... That's him, that's
the man I was talking to you about.

01:24:34.120 --> 01:24:36.720
I know exactly who that is.

01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:39.320
So... Another case cracked.

01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:41.840
How very public-spirited.

01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:44.160
Though that's never really
your motivation, is it?

01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:46.840
What are you doing here?

01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:48.400
As ever, I'm concerned about you.

01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:50.800
Yes, I've been hearing
about your "concern".

01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:52.560
Always so aggressive.

01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:55.440
Did it never occur to you that
you and I belong on the same side?

01:24:55.440 --> 01:24:57.520
Oddly enough - no.

01:24:57.520 --> 01:25:00.600
We have more in common
than you'd like to believe.

01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:03.720
This petty feud between us
is simply childish.

01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:07.480
People will suffer. And you know
how it always upset Mummy.

01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:10.280
I upset her?

01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:12.640
Me?

01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:14.960
It wasn't me that upset her, Mycroft.

01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:16.360
No. No, wait...

01:25:16.360 --> 01:25:17.760
Mummy? Who's Mummy?

01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:20.200
Mother. Our mother.

01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:21.880
This is my brother, Mycroft.

01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:23.840
Putting on weight again?

01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:27.280
Losing it, in fact.
He's your brother?

01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:29.160
Course he's my brother.

01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:31.720
So he's not... Not what?

01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:35.640
I don't know... Criminal mastermind?

01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:38.960
Close enough. For goodness' sake.

01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:41.280
I occupy a minor position
in the British government.

01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:46.160
He IS the British government,
when he's not too busy being
the British secret service

01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:47.800
or the CIA on a freelance basis.

01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:51.400
Good evening, Mycroft. Try not
to start a war before I get home,

01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:53.040
you know what it does
for the traffic.

01:25:55.880 --> 01:25:59.320
So, when you say you're
concerned about him -
you actually are concerned?

01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:00.840
Yes, of course.

01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:03.960
I mean, it actually is
a childish feud?

01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:06.920
He's always been so resentful.

01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:10.560
You can imagine
the Christmas dinners. Yeah...

01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:12.600
No... God, no.

01:26:13.680 --> 01:26:15.520
I'd better erm...

01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:17.680
Hello again.

01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:20.920
Hello.
We met earlier on this evening.

01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:23.960
Oh! OK. Goodnight.

01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:25.600
Goodnight, Dr Watson.

01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:29.200
So, dim sum. Mmm!

01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:31.720
I can always predict
the fortune cookies. No, you can't.

01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:33.760
Almost can. You did get shot, though.

01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:36.120
Sorry? In Afghanistan.
There was an actual wound.

01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:38.520
Oh. Yeah, shoulder.
Shoulder! I thought so.

01:26:38.520 --> 01:26:41.840
No, you didn't. The left one.
Lucky guess. I never guess.

01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:43.400
Yes, you do.

01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:46.040
What are you so happy about?
Moriarty.

01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:49.200
What's Moriarty?
I've absolutely no idea.

01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:53.480
Sir, shall we go?

01:26:53.480 --> 01:26:56.280
Interesting, that soldier fellow.

01:26:56.280 --> 01:26:59.040
He could be the making
of my brother...

01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:00.680
or make him worse than ever.

01:27:01.720 --> 01:27:04.680
Either way, we'd better
upgrade their surveillance status.

01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:07.080
Grade three active.

01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:09.080
Sorry, sir - whose status?

01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:14.440
Sherlock Holmes, and Dr Watson.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:48.500
