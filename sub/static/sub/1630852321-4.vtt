00:24.894 --> 00:26.896
- Oh, see, it's already done.

00:26.939 --> 00:28.463
- Right?
- Perfect.

00:28.506 --> 00:30.378
- I was just--Luann, did you
see the schedule for today?

00:30.421 --> 00:31.683
We were just going through it.

00:31.727 --> 00:33.468
- Oh, wonderful.
I'd love to hear the schedule.

00:33.511 --> 00:36.906
- So we're gonna be serving
breakfast in about 20 minutes.

00:36.949 --> 00:38.821
- Okay.
- Um...

00:44.522 --> 00:47.395
The art of flirting
is almost extinct.

00:47.438 --> 00:51.312
And I love the fact that
Michael has polished his art.

00:51.355 --> 00:53.183
- 11:00, the taxis are coming.

00:53.227 --> 00:54.750
They're gonna take us down
to the buggies.

00:54.793 --> 00:57.144
And we have little land tours
in these cute little...

00:57.187 --> 00:59.015
- What fun!
- Ladybug.

00:59.059 --> 01:00.364
- Yeah, okay.

01:00.408 --> 01:01.800
- And then we have
a special sushi chef.

01:01.844 --> 01:03.846
- Let the games begin.

01:03.889 --> 01:06.153
You know, it's great to have
somebody to speak French with,

01:06.196 --> 01:08.111
because my French
is getting rusty.

01:08.155 --> 01:10.331
And who doesn't love to flirt?

01:18.817 --> 01:20.689
- Are you married?
- I am married, yeah.

01:20.732 --> 01:21.994
- Yeah, no, I just saw
your wedding band.

01:22.038 --> 01:23.126
- I'm married.

01:23.170 --> 01:25.998
- I didn't know he was married.

- Oh, hi.

on your bed,

02:20.575 --> 02:22.664
because--because
we're having breakfast.

02:22.707 --> 02:24.709
- Oh, we're having breakfast?
- We're having breakfast.

02:24.753 --> 02:26.233
- Yeah, you were
partying all night.

02:26.276 --> 02:27.625
- Look at the lady of leisure.

02:29.932 --> 02:31.586
- Yeah, come in.

02:31.629 --> 02:33.327
- Knock, knock.
- Come in, come in, come in.

02:33.370 --> 02:34.545
- Hi!
- Good morning.

02:34.589 --> 02:36.591
Some--putting some sunblock on.

02:36.634 --> 02:38.549
- Do you want to go
for a walk or anything?

02:38.593 --> 02:39.855
- Oh, you look pretty.
I love that color on you.

02:39.898 --> 02:40.943
- Oh, thank you.
- Morning.

02:40.986 --> 02:42.205
- Oh, cards.
Let me hear the cards.

02:42.249 --> 02:43.772
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

02:43.815 --> 02:44.773
- I know you were sleeping.
I didn't want to bother you.

02:44.816 --> 02:46.035
- I know. I always sleep.

02:46.078 --> 02:47.863
- I need to find out
who was playing music

02:47.906 --> 02:49.125
in my speakers last night.

02:49.169 --> 02:50.605
- Oh, probably Ramona.

02:50.648 --> 02:52.650
She's the queen of
the putting the music blasting.

02:52.694 --> 02:55.218
- No, this--I don't think--this
was not her kind of music.

02:55.262 --> 02:57.438
- No?
- No, it was all, like, rap.

02:57.481 --> 02:59.179
- So you put it by your bed,
and the first thing you do

02:59.222 --> 03:00.789
is wake up and be--

03:00.832 --> 03:02.486
- Yeah. Like, I just
wanted to show you.

03:02.530 --> 03:04.314
So this is, like,
the first one he gave me.

03:04.358 --> 03:06.316
- Oh, my God, look at how
pretty, all the kisses.

03:06.360 --> 03:07.839
This is so--I'm gonna cry.
So sweet.

03:07.883 --> 03:11.452
- This is the second one.
- Oh, my God.

03:11.495 --> 03:12.627
"The person who loves you more

03:12.670 --> 03:14.106
"than anyone else
in the universe.

03:14.150 --> 03:15.847
XOXO." Day three.

03:15.891 --> 03:17.284
- This is the third one.

03:17.327 --> 03:19.286
I feel like Ramona's
kind of lonely,

03:19.329 --> 03:20.635
and I feel bad for her.

03:20.678 --> 03:23.072
- I would love a man
to write me love letters

03:23.115 --> 03:24.465
<i>every day that I was gone.</i>

03:24.508 --> 03:26.815
- I think Ramona needs
some vitamin D in her life.

03:26.858 --> 03:29.470
I think that'll definitely
mellow her out.

03:29.513 --> 03:32.821
This is day four.
Aww, little--two little cats.

03:32.864 --> 03:33.952
- Aww.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.481
- "You give me
the chills all over.

03:40.524 --> 03:43.353
I want to cuddle
with you forever."

03:43.397 --> 03:46.487
- Okay, this is so,
so beautiful.

03:46.530 --> 03:47.575
- So that's it.
- You are one lucky girl.

03:47.618 --> 03:48.793
- And then I have day five,
six...

03:48.837 --> 03:49.968
- I love it.
- Seven, and eight.

03:50.012 --> 03:51.970
- I love it.
It is just so, so special.

03:52.014 --> 03:55.887
- What are you wearing today?
- That's a good question.

03:55.931 --> 03:58.716
I was actually just gonna go
through everything right now.

03:58.760 --> 03:59.891
I don't know.

04:02.024 --> 04:03.373
- I've gotten to know you.

04:03.417 --> 04:05.593
I think you're a beautiful
person inside and out.

04:05.636 --> 04:07.812
Like, I think you have
so much love to give.

04:07.856 --> 04:09.684
I know you're gonna find it.
I know you are.

04:09.727 --> 04:11.686
Like, I--and I want
to give energy.

04:11.729 --> 04:13.470
- I hope so. Give it to me.
- Yes. Yes.

04:13.514 --> 04:14.471
- Give me that energy.
- You're gonna find your love.

04:14.515 --> 04:15.690
Because I did.
I never thought--

04:15.733 --> 04:17.126
- No, this is what
you're finding out.

04:17.169 --> 04:18.214
I don't think you even
had this with Joe, did you?

04:18.258 --> 04:19.563
- No, I didn't.

04:19.607 --> 04:20.869
And I just want you
to know you're special,

04:20.912 --> 04:23.872
and you're gonna find
the love of your life.

04:23.915 --> 04:25.917
- I mean, I'm ready for that.
I really--finally--

04:25.961 --> 04:27.441
- For you, Luann, and Kenya.

04:27.484 --> 04:28.746
- I actually did put it
out in the universe.

04:28.790 --> 04:30.357
So I'd like a man
in his 50s.

04:30.400 --> 04:31.793
Someone who's semiretired.

04:31.836 --> 04:33.447
Someone who doesn't
hold a grudge.

04:33.490 --> 04:34.535
Someone who makes me laugh.

04:34.578 --> 04:35.666
Someone whose children
are older.

04:35.710 --> 04:36.580
A partner.

04:36.624 --> 04:38.756
- Let me get Ramona down here.

04:38.800 --> 04:40.323
- People come into your life
for a reason.

04:40.367 --> 04:42.586
I think John--you know,
I really like this guy for you.

04:43.631 --> 04:45.937
- Here's to Turks and Caicos.

04:45.981 --> 04:47.417
- Ladies.
- You know what?

04:47.461 --> 04:49.550
But maybe you should
let him know just, like...

04:49.593 --> 04:50.855
- Right.

04:50.899 --> 04:52.509
- You know, how come you're not
with someone

04:52.553 --> 04:53.815
and see what he says.

04:53.858 --> 04:55.556
You're doing the right thing.
Take it slow.

04:55.599 --> 04:57.427
- Yeah.
- He should come to you.

04:57.471 --> 04:58.689
- But I can live anywhere.
- Right.

04:58.733 --> 05:00.169
- I'll have to bring that up
in conversation.

05:00.212 --> 05:01.605
- So yes.

05:01.649 --> 05:03.738
So just let--I would
put it out there somewhere.

05:03.781 --> 05:04.782
- Actually, you know
what I say now?

05:04.826 --> 05:05.914
- Uh-huh.

05:05.957 --> 05:07.307
- They go,
"Well, where do you live?"

05:07.350 --> 05:08.482
I go, "I'm not really sure
where I live right now."

05:08.525 --> 05:10.266
- All right, that's good.
- Girls, breakfast!

05:10.310 --> 05:12.268
'Cause we're leaving! Let's go!

05:12.312 --> 05:14.792
- Leaving? I want to--I
don't have time to work out?

05:14.836 --> 05:17.055
- Man.
- 11:00 we need to be out.

05:17.099 --> 05:18.970
- I know, that's why I'm trying
to rush everybody along.

05:19.014 --> 05:20.842
It's already--what time is it?
10:00?

05:23.801 --> 05:27.718
- If anyone finds a sock
down there, it's mine.

05:27.762 --> 05:29.372
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

05:29.416 --> 05:30.417
- Hey, Teresa.
- Good morning.

05:30.460 --> 05:31.722
- Hi. How are you? Morning.

05:31.766 --> 05:33.028
- How are you?
- I'm sorry--

05:33.071 --> 05:34.899
- Cute pictures of
your boyfriend you posted.

05:34.943 --> 05:36.292
- I miss him.

05:36.336 --> 05:37.424
- Aww.
- No kidding.

05:37.467 --> 05:39.077
- You posted some
pictures of bae?

05:39.121 --> 05:40.557
- She's taking a picture
of a hammock last night

05:40.601 --> 05:42.385
with this big smile.
She goes,

05:42.429 --> 05:45.954
"Louie loves hammocks."
And I'm like, no.

05:45.997 --> 05:48.609
- I had a conversation with
my guy in Tulum this morning.

05:48.652 --> 05:49.958
- Oh, what were you guys
talking about?

05:50.001 --> 05:52.134
- He's coming in May
to the Hamptons.

05:52.177 --> 05:53.440
- Oh.

05:53.483 --> 05:54.441
- I've always wanted to have
a Latin lover,

05:54.484 --> 05:55.920
and now I have one.

05:55.964 --> 05:57.966
And we see each other
when we see each other.

05:58.009 --> 06:00.272
<i>There's no strings attached,
and it's easy breezy.</i>

06:00.316 --> 06:03.275
I think it's important that
people enjoy their sexuality

06:03.319 --> 06:04.799
and have sex,

06:04.842 --> 06:06.801
'cause I think it's very good
for the soul.

06:06.844 --> 06:08.411
So I'd love to take him to,
like,

06:08.455 --> 06:11.806
some sort of exotic--something,
like, really swanky, sexy.

06:11.849 --> 06:15.157
- Has he seen your show?
- He hasn't seen my show

06:15.200 --> 06:16.767
because of COVID.

06:16.811 --> 06:17.812
- Did you guys get to see her
in "Chicago"?

06:17.855 --> 06:19.248
She looked like she killed it.

06:19.291 --> 06:21.119
<i>- She did amazing.
- That's not an easy role.</i>

06:21.163 --> 06:22.904
Playing Roxie? That's a lot.

06:22.947 --> 06:24.688
- NeNe did it on our show.
- Yeah.

06:24.732 --> 06:27.256
- And Kandi did it.
We got some talent in Atlanta.

06:27.299 --> 06:28.953
- I know.
- On Broadway?

06:28.997 --> 06:31.434
- Yeah. They asked me
to play Mama Morton.

06:31.478 --> 06:33.654
- I mean, now that
you brought up NeNe,

06:33.697 --> 06:36.091
do you guys still talk?

06:36.134 --> 06:38.485
- Not really.

06:38.528 --> 06:40.356
I just don't enjoy
talking about it.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.010
And I get asked about it
all the time.

06:42.053 --> 06:43.446
I will always have love
and respect for her.

06:43.490 --> 06:44.839
- No, that's--

06:44.882 --> 06:46.667
- But I'm fine with not
being friends with her.

06:46.710 --> 06:48.016
- Right.

06:48.059 --> 06:49.670
- What I've learned with
my relationship with NeNe

06:49.713 --> 06:52.281
is that communication is key.

06:52.324 --> 06:56.503
Last night,
for my Bailey-cue...

06:56.546 --> 06:59.506
- Yes.
- Two--what are you doing?

06:59.549 --> 07:01.203
- Oh, just rinsing my feet off.

07:01.246 --> 07:04.511
- With Kenya, you know,
the energy seems weird.

07:04.554 --> 07:05.903
Like, I don't really know
what's going on.

07:05.947 --> 07:07.905
That's tough.
I--you know, I survived NeNe.

07:07.949 --> 07:09.907
I don't know if I can survive
NeNe and Kenya.

07:09.951 --> 07:11.953
Now, that's a lot.
- I think it reminds me of you

07:11.996 --> 07:13.607
and NeNe with me
and Jacqueline,

07:13.650 --> 07:15.086
and me and Jacqueline
were really close.

07:15.130 --> 07:17.262
Like, we were friends
before the show.

07:17.306 --> 07:19.526
I mean, I'm the most
loving person there is.

07:19.569 --> 07:21.136
You know? I mean--

07:21.179 --> 07:22.659
- Quit when you're ahead.

07:22.703 --> 07:25.227
- Jacqueline, tell her this.
I've known her nine years.

07:25.270 --> 07:28.056
I would have never crossed her,
and she crossed me.

07:28.099 --> 07:31.015
Somebody could have been
putting that story out,

07:31.059 --> 07:32.930
and they did,
about the jail thing.

07:32.974 --> 07:34.584
- But can you understand
how was I gonna know better?

07:34.628 --> 07:35.846
- No. I can't.

07:35.890 --> 07:37.892
- You put it in a tabloid.

07:37.935 --> 07:39.197
- You were going through
legal issues.

07:39.241 --> 07:42.592
I never asked you a question.

07:42.636 --> 07:44.159
- Mine wasn't a criminal case.

07:44.202 --> 07:46.857
I wouldn't file a fraudulent
bankruptcy like you did.

07:46.901 --> 07:48.642
- See, that--that's a
low blow.

07:48.685 --> 07:51.601
That was it.
And I was so heartbroken.

07:51.645 --> 07:53.734
It was, like, really hard
for me to deal with that,

07:53.777 --> 07:55.431
'cause it was, like--

07:55.475 --> 07:56.432
- No, it's--it's...
- I was so hurt.

07:56.476 --> 07:57.564
- Devastating.
- Yeah.

07:57.607 --> 07:58.782
- I really was.
Like, I was really hurt.

07:58.826 --> 08:01.219
- Like, I literally talked
to NeNe probably

08:01.263 --> 08:02.786
30 times a day every day.

08:02.830 --> 08:04.092
- Yeah, me and her too.

08:04.135 --> 08:07.704
- We just had that--
we just had something.

08:07.748 --> 08:09.880
- Yeah. We used to talk hours.

08:09.924 --> 08:11.099
- Yeah.
- You had special chemistry.

08:11.142 --> 08:13.188
- And I'm like,
I don't understand why.

08:13.231 --> 08:17.148
- The biggest problem
in these friendships

08:17.192 --> 08:20.021
<i>in reality television is
some of these women care more</i>

08:20.064 --> 08:23.503
about what the audience think
than what their friends think.

08:23.546 --> 08:24.939
- The show does put pressure
on you,

08:24.982 --> 08:27.681
but if you allow it
to put pressure on you.

08:27.724 --> 08:29.900
<i>So if a relationship
goes sour,</i>

08:29.944 --> 08:33.600
it's not the show's fault,
and it ends up exposing people

08:33.643 --> 08:35.602
that are really
not there for you.

08:35.645 --> 08:38.561
She brought up, like,
my legal stuff!

08:38.605 --> 08:39.693
A true friend
would have never

08:39.736 --> 08:41.477
brought that up
on national TV, right?

08:41.521 --> 08:42.739
- Not your real friend.

08:42.783 --> 08:44.045
- She was my best friend.

08:44.088 --> 08:45.786
- Right.
- You're close to Erika, right?

08:45.829 --> 08:47.962
- Mm-hmm.
- And, like, if she tells you,

08:48.005 --> 08:49.311
like, "Don't bring up
my legal stuff"...

08:49.354 --> 08:50.921
- Right.

08:50.965 --> 08:53.010
- You're not gonna bring up
her legal stuff on TV, are you?

08:56.579 --> 08:58.276
- No, but she--
the thing is...

09:00.670 --> 09:02.193
- Right.
- Oh.

09:02.237 --> 09:04.631
- So then I asked questions
that can give her--you know,

09:04.674 --> 09:07.503
like, that I know will give her
a chance to explain her side,

09:07.547 --> 09:08.722
you know what I mean?
Just, like--

09:08.765 --> 09:10.941
- This is a great topic.
I love this topic,

09:10.985 --> 09:13.117
because we know it's out there
in the papers, right?

09:13.161 --> 09:15.076
So how much can we
guard our friend?

09:15.119 --> 09:16.860
- Oh, no.
- I know it's coming.

09:16.904 --> 09:18.166
- It was so bad.
- You know, I know the red

09:18.209 --> 09:19.733
dot's on my head,
and it's a terrible feeling.

09:19.776 --> 09:20.995
- "I know the red dot's
on my head."

09:21.038 --> 09:22.518
- At least you know
it's coming.

09:22.562 --> 09:23.737
At least you know it's coming,
instead of just getting

09:23.780 --> 09:24.868
your head blown off
and you didn't even know.

09:24.912 --> 09:26.217
- Well, like I did
with Bethenny.

09:26.261 --> 09:29.177
She showed me a picture
on camera that I was not

09:29.220 --> 09:31.832
expecting--that my husband
was kissing somebody else.

09:31.875 --> 09:33.181
- I remember that.
That was bad.

09:33.224 --> 09:35.357
- It was terrible.

09:35.400 --> 09:36.924
I think I'm gonna throw up.

09:40.536 --> 09:43.583
- It's Wednesday night.
So that's at the--well,

09:43.626 --> 09:45.497
whatever--ask whatever
you want to know.

09:45.541 --> 09:46.760
- So you're saying

09:46.803 --> 09:47.935
that Bethenny
should have told you first.

09:47.978 --> 09:50.590
Like, "Hey, I have this."
Obviously.

09:50.633 --> 09:52.287
- It was horrible.
It broke my heart.

09:52.330 --> 09:53.897
- She's your best friend, yeah.
- That's, like, a double hurt.

09:53.941 --> 09:57.422
- Well, she claims to be
my friend. That's not a friend.

09:57.466 --> 10:00.295
Bethenny's agenda's always been
to have the spotlight on her.

10:00.338 --> 10:02.471
It was really more about her
than it was about me.

10:02.514 --> 10:05.300
<i>I'm glad that Bethenny
showed me the picture,</i>

10:05.343 --> 10:06.780
but I'm not happy
that she showed me on camera,

10:06.823 --> 10:08.695
because it was a very tough
thing to go through

10:08.738 --> 10:10.174
for the whole world to see.

10:10.218 --> 10:11.349
You would have never done
that to me.

10:11.393 --> 10:12.612
- Sure enough, I would have
been like,

10:12.655 --> 10:13.874
"I'm not doing this.
This is crazy."

10:13.917 --> 10:14.918
- Never.
- Same.

10:14.962 --> 10:16.006
- This is your husband.

10:16.050 --> 10:17.138
I was at your wedding.
- I know.

10:17.181 --> 10:18.618
- I know I couldn't
have done that.

10:18.661 --> 10:19.706
- 'Cause you're a good human.

10:19.749 --> 10:21.142
Good humans
don't do that stuff.

10:21.185 --> 10:22.796

10:22.839 --> 10:24.362
good humans don't do that.

10:34.416 --> 10:36.897

15:52.864 --> 15:54.475
- Does everybody want
to go shopping?

15:54.518 --> 15:56.129
Yeah, right?

15:56.172 --> 15:57.782
- This way, ladies. This way.
This way. Attention.

15:57.826 --> 15:59.132
- Go.
- This way, ladies. This way.

15:59.175 --> 16:00.307
This way.
- Whoo-hoo!

16:00.350 --> 16:01.656
- Amazing, ladies. Amazing.

16:01.699 --> 16:02.787

16:02.831 --> 16:05.138

16:05.181 --> 16:08.315
Amazing, ladies. Right on.
Right on. Right on. Beautiful.

<i>- With all the dust flying
and the dirt and the heat,</i>

16:11.013 --> 16:12.841
I'd rather be,
you know, on the beach.

16:14.408 --> 16:16.845
- I'm not a fan of being

16:16.888 --> 16:20.153
on highways
in tiny little cars.

16:20.196 --> 16:22.459

16:22.503 --> 16:24.418
Follow the leader.
Follow the leader.

16:30.163 --> 16:33.166

16:34.602 --> 16:35.559
Follow your leader.
Follow your leader.

16:35.603 --> 16:37.387
- Oh, my God, she's so naughty.

16:37.431 --> 16:38.693
I can't believe
how naughty she is.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.873
I'm gonna call 911 for the girl
wearing the yellow dress.

16:44.916 --> 16:48.746
- "Slow down, young lady.
You're gonna get in trouble."

16:48.790 --> 16:50.705
<i>- Kenya almost put us
in jeopardy several times</i>

16:50.748 --> 16:52.185

16:52.228 --> 16:53.360
She was like a wild chick.

16:53.403 --> 16:54.361
I don't know--what
was she thinking?

16:54.404 --> 16:55.797
She could have killed us.

16:55.840 --> 16:58.582
- I just want to let my hair
down and have fun, okay?

16:58.626 --> 17:01.585

17:13.771 --> 17:15.251
You could stop if you
can't make the turn.

17:15.295 --> 17:16.948
Just stop if you can't

17:16.992 --> 17:20.213
- Ahh!
- Don't crash into us!

17:21.997 --> 17:24.260
- Kenya gets a spanking.

17:24.304 --> 17:28.003
- Ahh!
- I love me a good daredevil.

17:30.005 --> 17:32.094
Oh, great, this is nice.
In the shade.

17:32.138 --> 17:33.530

anything to nibble on?

17:35.141 --> 17:37.273
- Oh, we want to order.
- We're just gonna order.

17:37.317 --> 17:39.754
- The network is always
so serious

17:39.797 --> 17:41.147
about getting your order.

17:41.190 --> 17:44.106
The drink needs to be served
on camera

17:44.150 --> 17:46.326
so that we can see the drink
coming into the shot.

17:46.369 --> 17:48.589
- When we are out and dining
on the "Housewives,"

17:48.632 --> 17:50.939
we're always in amazing
restaurants in great locations,

17:50.982 --> 17:52.636
so I can see

17:52.680 --> 17:54.290
why people would be interested
in what we're ordering.

17:54.334 --> 17:55.857
- I think sometimes we have
some palates

17:55.900 --> 17:57.293
that are adventuresome.

17:57.337 --> 17:59.556
And a lot of people just eat
the same thing, you know?

17:59.600 --> 18:01.254
<i>We go to some
exotic restaurants</i>

18:01.297 --> 18:04.648
that have exotic menus,
and yeah.

18:04.692 --> 18:05.997
That could be it.

18:06.041 --> 18:07.825
- I'll go first.
- I'll start.

18:07.869 --> 18:09.000
We're gonna have--we're gonna
share the Peking duck.

18:09.044 --> 18:10.524
- Shocker.
- I was...

18:10.567 --> 18:11.829
- Peking duck tacos.
- Giving him my order.

18:11.873 --> 18:13.135
- You--okay. Go ahead.

18:13.179 --> 18:14.267
- So allow me
to finish, please.

18:14.310 --> 18:15.442
- Please do.

18:15.485 --> 18:16.660
- Can I just have
an order of the tacos?

18:16.704 --> 18:17.879
- Yeah. The fish tacos?

18:17.922 --> 18:19.359
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

18:19.402 --> 18:21.404
- We're gonna split the duck
and the mashed burger?

18:21.448 --> 18:23.276
- That's too much, huh?
- No, I'm starving.

18:23.319 --> 18:24.712
- Okay. And a mashed burger.

18:24.755 --> 18:26.757
- The smash burger's
the best burger on the island.

18:26.801 --> 18:28.150
- Well, that was fun.

18:28.194 --> 18:30.021
That guy--I feel like--
feel like that guy...

18:30.065 --> 18:31.893
- Marvelous Marvin?
- He overtalked you guys,

18:31.936 --> 18:33.764
and you could have
zero conversation.

18:33.808 --> 18:35.418
- That was a lot of talking.

18:35.462 --> 18:38.334
- Who's got my--oh, you have
my--that little bag I gave you.

18:38.378 --> 18:40.467
So, girls, I brought this game

18:40.510 --> 18:42.338
called the Good,
the Bad, and the Ugly.

18:45.559 --> 18:46.821
- Oh!

18:46.864 --> 18:49.563
- What your thoughts are
on the good, the bad,

18:49.606 --> 18:52.043
and the ugly parts
of being housewives,

18:52.087 --> 18:53.784
reality television, et cetera,
okay?

18:53.828 --> 18:55.482
- Are we supposed to answer
what's good, what's bad,

18:55.525 --> 18:57.005
what's ugly
about the question you ask us?

18:57.048 --> 18:58.224
- Just pick a question.
- Okay.

19:00.748 --> 19:03.490
- Hopefully the cocktails
will come before you answer.

19:03.533 --> 19:05.927
Why don't you go first, Kyle?

19:05.970 --> 19:06.884
You look like
you're ready to go.

19:06.928 --> 19:08.059
- Oh.
- She's bright-eyed

19:08.103 --> 19:09.626
and bushy-tailed.
Okay.

19:09.670 --> 19:11.062
- Question is,

19:11.106 --> 19:13.195
"How has the show affected
your relationships?"

19:13.239 --> 19:14.283
- Being on the show. Yeah.

19:14.327 --> 19:15.676
- Well, you know,
people always say,

19:15.719 --> 19:18.069
"What do you think about
the 'Housewives' curse?"

19:18.113 --> 19:19.332
So many people...
- Right.

19:19.375 --> 19:20.724
- Get divorced,
on the "Housewives."

19:20.768 --> 19:21.812
- Yes.

19:21.856 --> 19:23.901
- I really believe, you know,

19:23.945 --> 19:27.296
that it made my husband's
and my relationship stronger.

19:27.340 --> 19:30.169
But I think that a lot of women
end up doing the show

19:30.212 --> 19:33.998
because they're not
in a great situation

19:34.042 --> 19:35.913
and they're thinking
it's gonna be their out--

19:35.957 --> 19:37.393
like, to give them
some independence.

19:37.437 --> 19:38.960
And there's already cracks
in the relationship.

19:39.003 --> 19:40.266
- Yes.
- That's why they do the show.

19:40.309 --> 19:42.398
And then it crumbles. 100%.

19:42.442 --> 19:44.095
So I don't really believe
in the curse.

19:44.139 --> 19:45.836
It doesn't ruin your marriage.

19:45.880 --> 19:50.667
You came into this show
with problems to begin with.

19:50.711 --> 19:52.103
If you come in like that,

19:52.147 --> 19:55.890
I give you one season,
two, tops.

19:55.933 --> 19:58.240
- You go through these issues.
Even with my own husband.

19:58.284 --> 19:59.720
Joe and I had an argument,

19:59.763 --> 20:01.548
a real argument
on the show one night.

20:01.591 --> 20:03.419
- Yeah.
- We're watching it,

20:03.463 --> 20:05.334
and I'm, like, looking at him,
and he's looking at me,

20:05.378 --> 20:07.249
and I'm like, I can't believe,
like, something could feel,

20:07.293 --> 20:09.120
like--not that
it could break us,

20:09.164 --> 20:11.819
but, like--it's scary.

20:11.862 --> 20:13.473
And then the Twitter starts.

20:13.516 --> 20:15.823
And then the Instagram starts.
And I'm--like, my heart drops,

20:15.866 --> 20:20.349
because I'm like, I will never
let this show take over.

20:20.393 --> 20:22.482
- I felt like I had
the perfect life.

20:22.525 --> 20:26.268
I swear to God.
Perfect marriage, perfect life.

20:26.312 --> 20:28.314
And then it all came
crashing down.

20:33.275 --> 20:35.756
- I always get stumped
on that question,

20:35.799 --> 20:38.193
<i>but my life is
really good right now,</i>

20:38.237 --> 20:39.673
<i>and I don't think
I would go back.</i>

20:39.716 --> 20:41.979
I think I wouldn't
change a thing.

20:42.023 --> 20:44.155
I mean, the only thing I wished

20:44.199 --> 20:46.157
is that my parents
were still here.

20:46.201 --> 20:48.072
<i>I wish I just had
more time with them.</i>

20:48.116 --> 20:49.465
But everything else,

20:49.509 --> 20:51.380
I guess it's the way
it was supposed to go.

20:51.424 --> 20:53.121
- Ladies, I'm gonna leave
some of these candles here

20:53.164 --> 20:54.688
to keep any bugs away, okay?

20:54.731 --> 20:56.255
- Thank you.
- There's no bees here, right?

20:56.298 --> 20:57.865
- Not that I know of.

20:57.908 --> 21:00.128
- Ramona's looking out for me
with the bees.

21:02.348 --> 21:03.653
I feel like I need
to bring my epi pen.

21:03.697 --> 21:05.655
- You have to learn
how to do this yourself.

21:05.699 --> 21:07.222
Push the--so it clicks.
You hear it click.

21:07.266 --> 21:08.745
- Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God.

21:08.789 --> 21:10.181
Oh, my God, I'm scared.
What is that?

21:10.225 --> 21:11.531
- I didn't do anything yet.

21:11.574 --> 21:13.097
- All right, babe,
what you got?

21:13.141 --> 21:14.708
- "What perks have you
experienced

21:14.751 --> 21:16.318
from being a Housewife?"

21:16.362 --> 21:18.059
Well, you know,
there's a lot of perks.

21:18.102 --> 21:19.713
One of the things
that comes to mind

21:19.756 --> 21:23.586
is just meeting women
that I wouldn't normally

21:23.630 --> 21:25.327
probably end up being friends with.

21:25.371 --> 21:27.503
Like, I think that was
the first thing for me--to,

21:27.547 --> 21:29.636
like, put myself
in a friend circle of people

21:29.679 --> 21:32.247
that I just--honestly,
if I wasn't a Housewife,

21:32.291 --> 21:35.032
I don't think I maybe
would have met these women.

21:35.076 --> 21:36.295
- Thank you, Cynthia.

21:36.338 --> 21:38.558
That's perfect.
Okay, Ramona's up.

21:38.601 --> 21:41.561
- Okay. "How do your kids feel
about you being on the show?"

21:41.604 --> 21:44.781
My daughter, when she
was about 11, she said,

21:44.825 --> 21:47.654
"Mom, Mom, why am I not on TV?
I should be on TV."

21:47.697 --> 21:52.746
So when I got on the show,
she said to me, "Mom,

21:52.789 --> 21:55.401
"I'm the one who's supposed
to be famous now, not you.

21:55.444 --> 21:57.533
"I was supposed to be famous.
I just want you to be my mom.

21:57.577 --> 21:58.882
Why do you have to be
on the show?"

21:58.926 --> 22:00.231
She did not like me--

22:00.275 --> 22:01.885
"Can't you just be a mom
like everyone else?"

22:01.929 --> 22:03.409
- Aww.
- I think it's fair

22:03.452 --> 22:06.499
to say most kids
just want a typical mom.

22:06.542 --> 22:08.370
Like, they don't want you
to be flashy.

22:08.414 --> 22:09.806
They don't want you
to come downstairs

22:09.850 --> 22:11.504
with, like, the outfit.

22:11.547 --> 22:13.897
- But there's something to be
said for freedom of expression.

22:13.941 --> 22:15.377
And sometimes--

22:15.421 --> 22:16.509
- It depends on what you want
to teach your daughters.

22:16.552 --> 22:17.553
- Right.

22:17.597 --> 22:18.946
- All right.
Kenya, you're next.

22:18.989 --> 22:21.731
- Ah, let's see. Ooh!

22:21.775 --> 22:26.780
"How have you been affected
by comments on social media?"

22:26.823 --> 22:28.259
- Media.
- Oh, yeah.

22:28.303 --> 22:30.305
- My first season
was the hardest,

22:30.349 --> 22:32.351
because I didn't know
about social media.

22:32.394 --> 22:36.006
Even now, I rarely post,
because I think it's the devil.

22:36.050 --> 22:39.706
People try to say that I paid
a man to be my boyfriend.

22:39.749 --> 22:42.622
- What?
- Someone accused me of that.

22:42.665 --> 22:45.189
And then he said something,
because he was mad.

22:46.887 --> 22:49.542
- Walter did a radio interview.
- Mm-hmm.

22:49.585 --> 22:52.849
- And he said you hired him

22:52.893 --> 22:57.114
to portray your boyfriend
on this show.

22:57.158 --> 23:00.422
- Absolutely not.
I would not waste my time

23:00.466 --> 23:02.424
pretending to be
in a relationship

23:02.468 --> 23:05.558
when I have a worldwide stage
to find me a man.

23:05.601 --> 23:07.951
My hand to God,
I've never paid a man.

23:07.995 --> 23:09.213
I want people to know

23:09.257 --> 23:11.259
and my daughter to know
this is not real.

23:11.302 --> 23:13.479
- Mm-hmm.

23:13.522 --> 23:15.611
- "What's the worst thing that
happened to you on the show?"

23:15.655 --> 23:18.440
And I've been thinking
about all the crazy,

23:18.484 --> 23:20.399
horrible things that happened
to me on the show.

23:20.442 --> 23:23.489
But I think, in total--
and it's--and I'm hearing

23:23.532 --> 23:26.622
you all--
it is keeping your sanity.

23:26.666 --> 23:32.193
I mean, keeping your head
looking in the right direction

23:32.236 --> 23:35.457
and not falling victim
to these people

23:35.501 --> 23:38.286
that try to take you down

23:38.329 --> 23:40.810
for whatever reasons--
because they're jealous,

23:40.854 --> 23:43.770
because, you know--you know,
they'd like to have your life,

23:43.813 --> 23:45.467
they, you know,
want to see you fall,

23:45.511 --> 23:49.428
they want--you know,
it's just really hard to keep

23:49.471 --> 23:52.605
level-headed in what we do
and not let the haters

23:52.648 --> 23:56.043
and not let, you know,
the relationships,

23:56.086 --> 24:00.047
the family, you know, suffer
because of what we do.

24:00.090 --> 24:04.138
So the worst part is really
just trying to stay alive

24:04.181 --> 24:05.661
as women and support
each other

24:05.705 --> 24:08.577
and--and knowing that
you're good enough.

24:08.621 --> 24:10.840
No
can tell you you're not.

24:10.884 --> 24:13.190

a Housewives support group.

29:16.015 --> 29:17.799

29:17.843 --> 29:20.367
Listen, you just have to think
about the fact this is--

29:24.632 --> 29:28.984
I was texting with my ex,
and he said something about

29:29.028 --> 29:32.596
going back to the first time
we met on a date,

29:32.640 --> 29:37.253
being those hopeful people
that we were.

29:37.297 --> 29:39.778
It just really pissed me off
that he had the nerve to--like,

29:39.821 --> 29:42.955
the audacity to feel like,
you know, after all the hell

29:42.998 --> 29:45.609
that he's raised in our
marriage and all the havoc.

29:45.653 --> 29:47.829
<i>And I'm like, we're here
because of you.</i>

29:47.873 --> 29:50.745
It just was a trigger.
I don't know why.

29:50.789 --> 29:52.878
It was just a trigger.

30:12.375 --> 30:16.423
Let's just say it just
has not been a good marriage.

30:21.645 --> 30:24.213
- I felt initially,
for the sake

30:24.257 --> 30:25.867
of my daughter being happy,

30:25.911 --> 30:28.565
I needed to stay
together for her.

30:28.609 --> 30:29.871
And now I understand

30:29.915 --> 30:33.744
that my happiness
will be her happiness.

30:33.788 --> 30:35.224
<i>So whatever that
looks like for me</i>

30:35.268 --> 30:39.098
is what I have to pursue,
and that means being single.

30:41.100 --> 30:43.102
- I don't blame you.
Let me see.

30:45.060 --> 30:47.236
- Hi, can I come in?

30:47.280 --> 30:48.934
What's wrong?

30:50.674 --> 30:52.111
Shut the door.

30:52.154 --> 30:53.329
Will you shut the--

30:53.373 --> 30:54.853
I don't--just,
I don't want to--

30:59.161 --> 31:00.641
- Honey.

31:02.121 --> 31:06.516
- It's just, he is
a horrible husband.

31:06.560 --> 31:10.564
"I forgot to tell you I'm sorry
for any pain I caused you."

31:10.607 --> 31:12.914
That's what made me upset.

31:12.958 --> 31:15.699
And I was like, you've
caused me nothing but pain.

31:15.743 --> 31:17.919
- I know, it's really--
it's just so hard

31:17.963 --> 31:19.921
to see you go through this,
Kenya.

31:19.965 --> 31:22.228
- That really makes me sad.
- Yeah.

31:22.271 --> 31:24.230
<i>- We've only been here
four days,</i>

31:24.273 --> 31:27.015
but there's some people
you can know for years

31:27.059 --> 31:29.104
and not want
to share anything with.

31:29.148 --> 31:32.194
Other people, you meet
and you feel safe with them.

31:32.238 --> 31:34.936
And I'm feeling like
I have that with Kenya.

31:34.980 --> 31:39.593
- I didn't want anyone to know
that I was breaking down.

31:39.636 --> 31:41.943
For Cynthia to walk in
with cameras,

31:41.987 --> 31:44.119
I just would have
really preferred her

31:44.163 --> 31:46.208
to check on me
as a friend first.

31:46.252 --> 31:49.037
- Regardless of where we're at
at this point, you know,

31:49.081 --> 31:51.083
in our friendship,
on the trip,

31:51.126 --> 31:54.477
I don't want to see Kenya cry
and be in pain.

31:54.521 --> 31:55.696
Like, you just have
to keep fighting.

31:55.739 --> 31:56.915
He's just not gonna
give you anything.

31:56.958 --> 31:58.351
You just have to fight him
the whole way.

31:58.394 --> 31:59.743
It's like a power thing.

31:59.787 --> 32:01.223
- That's what our marriage
has been the whole time.

32:01.267 --> 32:03.312
- I know. I've been there
the whole time. I know.

32:03.356 --> 32:04.835
- You know, it's just poor,
poor communication.

32:04.879 --> 32:06.968
And, you know, then
he has these epiphanies, like,

32:07.012 --> 32:09.318
"Oh, I'm sorry.
I forgot to tell you"--

32:09.362 --> 32:12.278
forgot to tell me you're sorry
you ever hurt me?

32:12.321 --> 32:13.888
Get the out of here.

32:16.369 --> 32:18.632
- The girls are late, though.
I'm gonna text them right now.

32:18.675 --> 32:20.373
- I'm ready.

32:20.416 --> 32:22.201
- I'm gonna have a cocktail.

32:22.244 --> 32:24.943
Oh, my God!

32:24.986 --> 32:27.162
- You look--oh, my God,
you're doing sexy jammies?

32:27.206 --> 32:28.990
- Doesn't it feel like
a real slumber party?

32:29.034 --> 32:31.340
- Yes, it does.
- I feel so bad.

32:31.384 --> 32:33.690
I feel like she still cares
about him a lot

32:33.734 --> 32:35.692
for that to trigger her.

32:35.736 --> 32:37.912
- Yeah. You know,
he's not a bad guy.

32:37.956 --> 32:41.524
He's not a bad person.
They're just not good together.

32:41.568 --> 32:43.570
Kenya is one tough cookie.

32:43.613 --> 32:45.093
But I feel like,
for some reason,

32:45.137 --> 32:49.010
when it comes to Marc,
there's a lot of blurred lines.

32:49.054 --> 32:50.707
- Cynthia?
- We're missing the glam squad.

32:50.751 --> 32:52.013
- Oh, my God.
- Yes!

32:52.057 --> 32:53.667
- Okay.
- Everyone downstairs?

32:53.710 --> 32:56.887
<i>- Like, there's a reason why
they just are not together,</i>

32:56.931 --> 32:58.454
<i>and they can't figure it out.</i>

32:58.498 --> 33:01.805
Maybe it's because they're just
not meant to be together.

33:01.849 --> 33:04.243
But that's between them
and God, child.

33:04.286 --> 33:05.418
- I have a question.

33:05.461 --> 33:06.897
Do you guys have ginger
for the sushi?

33:06.941 --> 33:08.725
- What are they doing up there?

33:08.769 --> 33:10.727
- Kenya was having
a little moment.

33:10.771 --> 33:13.165
She got a text from her ex.

33:13.208 --> 33:14.383
- What did it say?

33:14.427 --> 33:17.212
- It was just something
that set her off.

33:17.256 --> 33:18.518
- If you were sorry,

33:18.561 --> 33:19.475
you would have just been
a better human being.

33:19.519 --> 33:20.607
- That's what I'm saying.

33:20.650 --> 33:22.739
It's like--and then
it's a text.

33:22.783 --> 33:24.872
- How did she get shorts?

33:24.915 --> 33:26.700
- How cute!
- Oh!

33:26.743 --> 33:27.962
- Are they supposed
to be shorts?

33:28.006 --> 33:29.007
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

33:29.050 --> 33:30.269
- So they are.
- Okay.

33:30.312 --> 33:32.967
- All right, ladies.
- Vodka shots.

33:33.011 --> 33:35.056
- I have the first game
for you guys.

33:35.100 --> 33:38.320
So we're gonna put
a couple shots on the floor.

33:38.364 --> 33:41.410
Melissa's gonna kick it off
with a green shot.

33:41.454 --> 33:43.064
- Oy, oy, oy. Be careful.

33:43.108 --> 33:44.631
- You just gotta--you gotta
spread yourself out.

33:44.674 --> 33:46.067
We made it up as we're going.

33:46.111 --> 33:47.677
- You just made this up
yourself, Michael?

33:47.721 --> 33:49.723
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God! This is--

33:49.766 --> 33:51.203
- Oh, you were born
for this game.

33:51.246 --> 33:53.074
- Okay. Beautiful!
There you go!

33:53.118 --> 33:54.771
- No, she has to keep her hand
on the blue.

33:54.815 --> 33:56.643
I thought she had
to keep her hand on the blue.

33:56.686 --> 33:57.774

I'm not as versed at stretching

wide, circular objects.
