WEBVTT

00:01.275 --> 00:02.375
Kids, back in 2009,

00:02.375 --> 00:03.542
your Aunt Robin was the host

00:03.542 --> 00:05.909
of a morning show
for local New York cable.

00:05.909 --> 00:08.275
And it was on pretty early.
How early?

00:09.842 --> 00:11.208
Mike? wake up!

00:12.408 --> 00:15.141
But then, everything changed.

00:15.141 --> 00:16.341
Hey.
Hey.

00:16.341 --> 00:17.308
See my show?

00:17.308 --> 00:18.575
Oh, I meant
to watch it.

00:18.575 --> 00:19.675
I just got so busy

00:19.675 --> 00:21.675
with the whole
"being sound asleep" thing.

00:21.675 --> 00:23.809
It took all night,
eight hours down the drain.

00:23.809 --> 00:25.974
Oh, it's fine.
But get this:

00:25.974 --> 00:28.141
After the broadcast...

00:28.141 --> 00:30.442
Hi. Are you Robin?

00:30.442 --> 00:31.542
Yeah.

00:31.542 --> 00:32.674
I'm Don, your new co-host.

00:32.674 --> 00:34.675
Don was Don Frank,

00:34.675 --> 00:36.008
seasoned veteran of no fewer

00:36.008 --> 00:38.575
than 39 local
morning news teams

00:38.575 --> 00:40.208
from all over the country.

00:40.208 --> 00:42.542
The guy was an industry legend.

00:43.175 --> 00:45.775
Oh.

00:45.775 --> 00:48.442
Wow! You are
so going to hit that.

00:48.442 --> 00:49.941
No, I just think we're going

00:49.941 --> 00:51.708
to be great together
on the air.

00:51.708 --> 00:54.375
And on the sofa and on the bed
and on the coffee table.

00:54.375 --> 00:55.941
All right,
all right.

00:55.941 --> 00:57.508
I'm gonna go up on the
roof and stand there

00:57.508 --> 00:58.875
by myself for five minutes.

00:58.875 --> 00:59.941
Have fun.

00:59.941 --> 01:01.642
And that's exactly
what she did.

01:01.642 --> 01:04.641
She just stood there.

01:04.641 --> 01:06.608
All right, kids,
I'm gonna level with you.

01:06.608 --> 01:08.008
That's not what she did.

01:08.008 --> 01:09.108
Here's what she did.

01:09.108 --> 01:11.074
All right,
all right.

01:11.074 --> 01:12.508
I'm going to go
have a cigarette.

01:12.508 --> 01:13.875
What?!

01:13.875 --> 01:15.341
I promised her
I'd never tell you this,

01:15.341 --> 01:16.974
but once upon a time,
your Aunt Robin

01:16.974 --> 01:19.141
did enjoy
the occasional cigarette,

01:19.141 --> 01:22.341
and occasionally
that occasional cigarette...

01:22.341 --> 01:25.175
was more than just occasional.

01:28.108 --> 01:30.141
I just left something
like this in my apartment.

01:30.141 --> 01:32.842
Robin, come on,
take it to the roof.

01:32.842 --> 01:34.208
We said no smoking
in the apartment

01:34.208 --> 01:36.575
after you torched
the throw rug doing push-ups.

01:36.575 --> 01:37.708
All right, all right, all right.

01:37.708 --> 01:39.175
Geez.

01:39.175 --> 01:41.375
Yeah, Robin,
I mean, God,

01:41.375 --> 01:44.275
not only is that a
filthy habit, but also,

01:44.275 --> 01:45.875
can I bum one?
Sure.

01:45.875 --> 01:47.475
What?!

01:47.476 --> 01:51.118
<i>"How I Met Your Mother" </i>

01:51.119 --> 01:56.341
<i>- Sync By YesCool -</i>

01:56.342 --> 02:00.000
<i>WwW.addic7ed.com</i>

02:00.376 --> 02:02.408
Kids, your Uncle Marshall
definitely doesn't want you

02:02.408 --> 02:05.375
to know this,
but he also smoked off and on.

02:05.375 --> 02:09.008
It all started when he was 13,
on a camping trip in Minnesota.

02:09.008 --> 02:10.275
Come on, Marshall,
let's celebrate.

02:10.275 --> 02:11.974
It's summer vacation.

02:12.842 --> 02:15.875
Okay, but just one.

02:15.875 --> 02:17.909
This is my first
and last cigarette ever.

02:17.909 --> 02:22.041
And that was the first of many,
many "last cigarettes ever."

02:22.041 --> 02:23.508
That's it.

02:23.508 --> 02:25.375
I am done, I am out.

02:25.375 --> 02:26.408
Last...

02:26.408 --> 02:27.375
Cigarette...

02:27.375 --> 02:28.941
...ev-arrh!

02:28.941 --> 02:31.041
So, by that point,
I'd heard it all before.

02:31.041 --> 02:33.074
Last cigarette ever.

02:33.074 --> 02:35.708
What are you doing?
You haven't smoked
in six months.

02:35.708 --> 02:37.442
Is this about the McRib?

02:37.442 --> 02:38.708
It's gone, dude, let it go.

02:38.708 --> 02:40.608
I'm worried
about work, okay?

02:40.608 --> 02:42.974
They just hired a new head
of the legal department,

02:42.974 --> 02:44.775
and he's going
to be letting people go.

02:44.775 --> 02:46.308
So that's
why you're worried?

02:46.308 --> 02:50.175
The new head of the legal
department is Arthur Hobbes.

02:50.175 --> 02:52.141
As in "Artillery Arthur"?

02:52.141 --> 02:53.909
As in your former boss?

02:53.909 --> 02:55.475
Arthur Hobbes was
the meanest boss

02:55.475 --> 02:58.941
Marshall or anyone else
had ever had.

02:58.941 --> 03:01.508
The last time Marshall worked
for him, it ended like this.

03:01.508 --> 03:03.875
I quit!

03:03.875 --> 03:04.875
Yikes.

03:04.875 --> 03:06.442
So does he hold it
against you?

03:06.442 --> 03:08.141
Worse.

03:08.141 --> 03:09.575
I'm sorry,
who are you?

03:09.575 --> 03:12.308
I'm, I'm Marshall Eriksen.

03:12.308 --> 03:13.875
Hmm.

03:13.875 --> 03:16.809
Um, we had a fairly intense
screaming match.

03:16.809 --> 03:18.074
No.

03:18.074 --> 03:20.575
Wherein I suggested
that you take your head

03:20.575 --> 03:23.608
and store it within yourself

03:23.608 --> 03:24.941
in a fashion that,

03:24.941 --> 03:26.074
while, while space-saving,

03:26.074 --> 03:28.842
might limit its exposure
to, to sunshine.

03:28.842 --> 03:31.708
Well, that describes
95% of my employees

03:31.708 --> 03:34.909
and everyone in my family...
except for my dog.

03:34.909 --> 03:39.008
He's such a good boy.

03:39.008 --> 03:41.742
Well... I'll see you
later, uh...

03:41.742 --> 03:44.074
Randall Wilkerson.

03:44.074 --> 03:45.308
Marshall Eriksen.

03:45.308 --> 03:46.608
Gary Dinkersfield, right.

03:48.608 --> 03:50.141
Great, he doesn't remember you.

03:50.141 --> 03:51.442
Not great.

03:51.442 --> 03:52.708
Arthur Hobbes hating Marshall--
that's no big deal.

03:52.708 --> 03:54.074
He hates everyone.

03:54.074 --> 03:56.241
It's the people he doesn't know
that he cuts loose.

03:56.241 --> 03:58.974
He just fired
What's-His-Face.

03:58.974 --> 04:00.575
He fired What's-
His-Face, Ted,

04:00.575 --> 04:02.208
and What's-His-Face
was invaluable.

04:02.208 --> 04:04.442
Look, I can understand
you getting upset,

04:04.442 --> 04:06.108
but it's not worth
killing yourself over.

04:06.108 --> 04:09.475
Yeah, wait till you get
laid off, then kill yourself.

04:09.475 --> 04:10.875
Like What's-His-Face.

04:10.875 --> 04:15.275
Although I guess now
it's more like Where's-His-Face.

04:15.275 --> 04:16.375
Look, it was just
two cigarettes.

04:16.375 --> 04:18.507
Okay, I can handle two.

04:18.507 --> 04:21.408
As long as I don't have three
within 24 hours,

04:21.408 --> 04:22.775
then I'm not going
to get hooked again.

04:22.775 --> 04:23.842
What's Lily going

04:23.842 --> 04:25.775
to say when she finds out
you smoked?

04:25.775 --> 04:27.941
Lily's not going to find out.

04:27.941 --> 04:28.974
I have a system.

04:28.974 --> 04:31.208
Ah, yes, Marshall's system.

04:33.000 --> 04:39.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:44.208 --> 04:45.542
Hey, Lil.

04:45.542 --> 04:46.542
You smoked.

04:46.542 --> 04:48.041
Damn it!

04:48.041 --> 04:50.275
The next morning,
your Aunt Robin was thrilled

04:50.275 --> 04:52.909
to be finally going on the air
with a real pro.

04:52.909 --> 04:56.175
In three, two, one...

04:56.175 --> 04:57.442
Hi, I'm Robin
Scherbatsky.

04:57.442 --> 05:00.275
And I... am Don Frank.

05:00.275 --> 05:01.974
Two teens were arrested
late last night

05:01.974 --> 05:03.208
for stealing
a police cart.

05:03.208 --> 05:05.241
No, I'm sorry, not a
police cart, a police car.

05:05.241 --> 05:06.308
Oh.

05:06.308 --> 05:07.542
Aw, screw it.

05:07.542 --> 05:08.508
Brain fart.

05:09.742 --> 05:11.041
Don't you hate those?

05:11.041 --> 05:12.208
Oh, look at that,

05:12.208 --> 05:14.008
the teleprompter's
still running.

05:14.008 --> 05:17.408
Something about a woman
giving birth on an uptown bus.

05:17.408 --> 05:19.341
Well, no point
in jumping in halfway.

05:19.341 --> 05:22.508
I'll just wait
till it's done.

05:22.508 --> 05:26.542
Uh... and she cut the cord
with a Metropass.

05:26.542 --> 05:27.542
We'll be right back.

05:27.542 --> 05:29.241
And we're clear.

05:29.241 --> 05:31.708
What the hell was that?
Don, you said "brain fart."

05:31.708 --> 05:33.442
Look, Robin, you seem

05:33.442 --> 05:36.275
like a nice kid, but this is
my 39th local news show, okay?

05:36.275 --> 05:38.008
And in that time,
I've learned three things:

05:38.008 --> 05:40.442
avoid the all-you-can-eat
sushi buffet in Bismarck,

05:40.442 --> 05:43.408
do not go to the bathroom
with your lapel mic still on,

05:43.408 --> 05:44.708
and three, at this hour,

05:44.708 --> 05:46.475
your entire
viewing audience is

05:46.475 --> 05:49.475
one half-drunk slob sitting
in his underwear, so...

05:49.475 --> 05:52.108
Back in five, four...

05:52.108 --> 05:55.008
Well, let's do a great show
for that half-drunk slob.

05:55.008 --> 05:57.642
Well, that half-drunk slob
appreciates it.

05:57.642 --> 05:59.742
The next day, Marshall found
himself craving a cigarette.

05:59.742 --> 06:04.941
It was driving him crazy, so he
decided to get some fresh air.

06:06.974 --> 06:08.041
Oh, no.

06:08.041 --> 06:09.809
You're not up here to jump,
are you?

06:09.809 --> 06:10.974
No, no, no, no.

06:10.974 --> 06:12.275
I fired a lot of people today.

06:12.275 --> 06:14.175
I don't need another jumper
in my file.

06:16.341 --> 06:18.608
Oh, uh, cigarette?

06:18.608 --> 06:21.442
No, no, thank you.

06:21.442 --> 06:23.375
Too bad.

06:23.375 --> 06:25.041
You know what I miss, Jeffrey?

06:25.041 --> 06:27.608
Getting to know
somebody over a smoke.

06:27.608 --> 06:30.008
People are
so interchangeable now,

06:30.008 --> 06:34.408
but you share a butt with
somebody, you got a real bond.

06:35.275 --> 06:37.475
You know what?

06:37.475 --> 06:38.675
I will, I will take one.

06:38.675 --> 06:39.708
Okay.

06:40.842 --> 06:42.675
I'm Marshall, by the way,

06:42.675 --> 06:44.408
it's Marshall,
Marshall Eriksen.

06:44.408 --> 06:47.108
Yeah. Tell me something
Marshall Eriksen.

06:47.108 --> 06:49.208
How would you
like to see

06:49.208 --> 06:52.575
a picture of the cutest dog
in the world?

06:59.011 --> 07:01.327
Hey.
- You smoked.

07:02.011 --> 07:05.677
Yes, I smoked,
and it was my third of the day.

07:05.677 --> 07:06.877
You know what
that means?

07:06.877 --> 07:08.344
I'm a smoker now.
It's all over.

07:08.344 --> 07:10.811
I even bought a pack
on the way home and a lighter

07:10.811 --> 07:12.844
and a Vikings lamp, which has
nothing to do with anything,

07:12.844 --> 07:14.577
but I saw it in the window
and I liked it.

07:14.577 --> 07:15.877
Damn it, Marshall.

07:15.877 --> 07:18.844
We already have four
Viking lamps and smoking kills.

07:18.844 --> 07:21.911
It was a way to bond
with my boss, okay?

07:21.911 --> 07:23.844
You should have seen me
up there.

07:23.844 --> 07:25.244
That is a cute dog.

07:25.244 --> 07:26.610
Yeah.
Are those your kids?

07:26.610 --> 07:27.944
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

07:27.944 --> 07:30.545
Hey, oh, look what I got
at the mall.

07:33.911 --> 07:35.011
Aw.
There he is.

07:35.011 --> 07:36.577
There he is.

07:36.577 --> 07:38.044
Go ahead, you can pet him now.

07:38.044 --> 07:39.011
No.

07:39.011 --> 07:41.311
Yeah, yeah,
come on, he likes it.

07:42.445 --> 07:44.111
Scratch him under the chin.

07:46.877 --> 07:48.644
I don't care
what your reasons are.

07:48.644 --> 07:50.644
You know how I feel
about smoking.

07:50.644 --> 07:52.644
Now, give me
the cigarettes.

07:55.844 --> 07:58.111
And the lighter.

08:08.244 --> 08:10.744
Ah, that's the stuff.

08:10.744 --> 08:12.144
What?!
What?!
Oh, yeah,

08:12.144 --> 08:13.777
add your Aunt Lily to the list.

08:13.777 --> 08:15.844
Whenever Uncle Marshall fell
off the wagon,

08:15.844 --> 08:18.877
your Aunt Lily got dragged
right down with him.

08:18.877 --> 08:20.844
What you doing?

08:20.844 --> 08:22.478
If you must know,
I am reaching out

08:22.478 --> 08:25.445
to City Hall to try to get
the mayor on our show.

08:25.445 --> 08:26.710
Oh, my goodness, you are

08:26.710 --> 08:28.378
adorable,

08:28.378 --> 08:30.478
but the mayor's not coming
on a show nobody watches.

08:30.478 --> 08:33.378
My colonoscopy had
more viewers than this show.

08:33.378 --> 08:35.610
At least that had
some twists and turns.

08:35.610 --> 08:37.010
You know, I don't,
I don't know

08:37.010 --> 08:38.278
why you're acting
like this.

08:38.278 --> 08:39.876
Maybe you're just bitter
because you never had

08:39.876 --> 08:41.078
a shot at a network job,

08:41.078 --> 08:43.544
but I think I still do,
so I really need to focus.

08:43.544 --> 08:44.811
I've been
on a network.

08:46.677 --> 08:48.545
You were on a network?

08:48.545 --> 08:52.311
It was the best Labor Day
weekend of my life.

08:52.311 --> 08:54.811
When you do the news, you're
in these ergonomic chairs.

08:54.811 --> 08:56.710
It feels like you're sitting
on a cloud.

08:56.710 --> 08:59.777
Which was nice 'cause it was
right after my colonoscopy.

08:59.777 --> 09:02.344
And the dressing rooms?
Oh.

09:02.344 --> 09:03.577
There's dressing rooms?
Oh, you bet

09:03.577 --> 09:05.844
your sweet headset
there's dressing rooms, Mike.

09:05.844 --> 09:08.710
No changing in the KFC
bathroom across the street.

09:08.710 --> 09:10.178
No, sir.

09:10.844 --> 09:12.744
It was heaven.

09:12.744 --> 09:15.378
But the second you get used
to it, they go find someone

09:15.378 --> 09:17.545
who isn't "going through
a bitter divorce"

09:17.545 --> 09:19.944
and doesn't "reek of gin,"

09:19.944 --> 09:21.044
and before you know it,
you're stuck

09:21.044 --> 09:22.710
in a dead-end gig,

09:22.710 --> 09:24.411
surrounded by people
going nowhere,

09:24.411 --> 09:27.278
doing the news
in your tighty whities.

09:27.278 --> 09:30.911
Okay, the underwear thing
was your choice,

09:30.911 --> 09:31.977
and I don't like

09:31.977 --> 09:32.977
that it's catching on.

09:32.977 --> 09:35.710
Ah, looking good,
fellas.

09:35.710 --> 09:36.877
Feels good, right?

09:36.877 --> 09:38.311
God, I want
to kill him.

09:38.311 --> 09:39.677
Of course people
watch the show.

09:39.677 --> 09:41.944
You guys watch the show,
that's, like, two right there.

09:44.378 --> 09:45.545
Oh, my God.

09:45.545 --> 09:47.677
You guys still
haven't seen my show.

09:47.677 --> 09:50.545
What? We never miss it.
We've seen it!

09:50.545 --> 09:52.644
Really? What color is the set?

09:52.644 --> 09:55.411
Uh...

09:55.411 --> 09:56.877
Yeah, uh...
It's black.

09:56.877 --> 09:58.710
Right. Yeah.
With, like, silver

09:58.710 --> 10:00.078
Uh-huh. Yeah.
around the edges.

10:00.078 --> 10:02.044
Not your TV set, my show set.

10:02.044 --> 10:03.577
Ah...
Oh...

10:03.577 --> 10:05.577
God, if I can't even get
my best friends to watch,

10:05.577 --> 10:06.911
who's going to watch?

10:06.911 --> 10:08.011
Lots of people.

10:08.011 --> 10:10.710
Uh, you got bedridden
insomniacs.
Hmm.

10:10.710 --> 10:13.777
Bums camping outside
a department store.

10:13.777 --> 10:14.944
People waiting

10:14.944 --> 10:17.877
in the ER, where
the TV is in a cage,

10:17.877 --> 10:19.944
so you can't change
the channel.

10:20.710 --> 10:22.344
Ooh, do you have any stalkers?

10:22.344 --> 10:25.445
Yeah, but even Leonard
won't watch my show.

10:26.610 --> 10:28.545
I can't believe those guys
are smoking out there.

10:28.545 --> 10:29.777
It's freezing out.

10:29.777 --> 10:32.378
Remember when you used to be
able to smoke in bars?

10:32.378 --> 10:34.211
Oh, hey, dude.
I think that

10:34.211 --> 10:36.044
hot girl over there's
smiling at me.

10:36.044 --> 10:38.111
Uh, that's a chair.

10:38.111 --> 10:39.877
But yeah, dude, hit that.

10:40.644 --> 10:42.211
Guys?

10:42.211 --> 10:43.577
Marco!

10:43.577 --> 10:45.744
Polo!
Polo!

10:45.744 --> 10:49.178
Well, it's dividing our group
into smokers and non-smokers.

10:49.178 --> 10:50.478
And that's not healthy.

10:50.478 --> 10:52.278
You're right.

10:53.178 --> 10:54.777
Let's go have a smoke.

10:54.777 --> 10:55.844
What?!
What?!

10:55.844 --> 10:57.511
Yeah, I'm not proud of it.

10:57.511 --> 10:58.977
Look at you two.

10:58.977 --> 11:00.311
Smokers.

11:00.311 --> 11:01.911
Just like the rest of us.

11:01.911 --> 11:05.545
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:05.545 --> 11:07.677
I am not a smoker.

11:07.677 --> 11:08.644
I only smoke

11:08.644 --> 11:10.411
in certain situations.

11:10.411 --> 11:13.478
Postcoital,
when I'm with Germans--

11:13.478 --> 11:15.710
sometimes those two overlap--

11:15.710 --> 11:18.111
coital, birthdays,

11:18.111 --> 11:19.744
to annoy my mom,

11:19.744 --> 11:21.044
precoital,

11:21.044 --> 11:23.610
on a sailboat, the day the Mets

11:23.610 --> 11:25.511
are mathematically eliminated
every year,

11:25.511 --> 11:26.577
and, of course--

11:26.577 --> 11:28.877
wait for it,
'cause Lord knows I have--

11:28.877 --> 11:31.211
pregnancy scares.

11:31.211 --> 11:32.478
Why are you smoking
right now?

11:32.478 --> 11:35.511
I'm always precoital, Ted.

11:35.511 --> 11:37.311
You know, maybe
smoking's not so bad.

11:37.311 --> 11:40.511
I mean, at least it gets us
out in the fresh air.

11:40.511 --> 11:42.844
Yeah, and all the coughing
really works my abs.

11:42.844 --> 11:46.677
I... am... ripped!

11:46.677 --> 11:48.478
But, as glamorous as it was,

11:48.478 --> 11:50.844
within a week,
we all hit our breaking point.

11:53.478 --> 11:54.977
You okay, sweetie?

11:54.977 --> 11:58.411
Actually, baby,
my throat's a bit sore.

12:16.911 --> 12:18.577
So, I'm whapping
him across the nose

12:18.577 --> 12:19.844
with the
newspaper, right?
Yeah.

12:19.844 --> 12:21.078
And my wife says,

12:21.078 --> 12:23.411
"Come on, you can't
treat your son like that."

12:23.411 --> 12:25.111
I don't know.

12:27.644 --> 12:29.545
Michael, call 911.

12:30.378 --> 12:31.511
Oh... oh, my God.

12:31.511 --> 12:33.111
Okay, yes, yeah, right away.

12:33.111 --> 12:35.214
It's Marshall, by the way.

12:41.638 --> 12:42.705
Oh, my God.

12:42.705 --> 12:44.304
I hope Arthur's okay.

12:44.304 --> 12:45.938
Dibs on his office if he's not.

12:45.938 --> 12:47.672
We have to quit smoking.

12:47.672 --> 12:50.072
Honey, you said a mouthful.

12:50.072 --> 12:51.471
I wish I had never started.

12:51.471 --> 12:54.271
I mean, I think back
to myself at 13 years old.

12:54.271 --> 12:57.605
If I could only go back
to that moment...

13:04.338 --> 13:06.271
I hate that little bastard.

13:06.271 --> 13:08.139
Me, too.

13:08.139 --> 13:09.338
Okay, that's it.

13:09.338 --> 13:11.204
Let's quit.

13:11.204 --> 13:13.105
Let's... Let's do it.

13:13.105 --> 13:14.938
Well, I am proud of you guys.

13:14.938 --> 13:18.072
I have heard how difficult it is
for smokers

13:18.072 --> 13:19.304
like yourself
to quit,

13:19.304 --> 13:20.705
so, on behalf of nonsmokers,

13:20.705 --> 13:23.371
I salute you,
and I am here to help.

13:23.371 --> 13:24.605
So, hand in your cigarettes,

13:24.605 --> 13:27.005
and I will get rid of them
one at a time.

13:27.005 --> 13:28.738
You're quitting, dollface.

13:28.738 --> 13:31.238
I know I don't normally
call you dollface,

13:31.238 --> 13:33.271
but it kind of works
in this voice.

13:33.271 --> 13:34.805
Dollface.

13:34.805 --> 13:35.938
Hey, guys.
Hey.

13:35.938 --> 13:38.105
Uh, I was just wondering, um,

13:38.105 --> 13:40.471
is anyone else
interviewing the mayor

13:40.471 --> 13:43.204
tomorrow on TV,
or is it just me?

13:43.204 --> 13:44.405
Hey, that's great.
Whoa!

13:44.405 --> 13:45.538
Hey!

13:45.538 --> 13:47.672
Yeah, Don can suck it
while I suck this.

13:47.672 --> 13:48.905
Light me, Marshall.

13:48.905 --> 13:50.505
Actually, um, we've decided

13:50.505 --> 13:52.705
that we're all
quitting smoking.

13:52.705 --> 13:54.005
That's fantastic.

13:54.005 --> 13:56.405
I'm sick of you guys
bumming my cigarettes.

13:56.405 --> 13:58.039
No, come on, Robin.
We-we can't do it

13:58.039 --> 13:59.238
unless we all do it together.

13:59.238 --> 14:00.571
No.

14:00.571 --> 14:02.171
You can sleep with Marshall.

14:02.171 --> 14:03.605
Oh, God, Lily, no.

14:03.605 --> 14:05.972
Sorry, baby, you got to take one
for the team.

14:05.972 --> 14:08.271
I-I don't want
to sleep with Marshall.

14:08.271 --> 14:10.605
I've seen the looks.
Right.

14:10.605 --> 14:11.838
I can't quit right now.

14:11.838 --> 14:13.938
Not before the biggest interview
of my life.

14:13.938 --> 14:15.171
It's-it's too stressful.

14:15.171 --> 14:16.471
It's too stressful!

14:16.471 --> 14:17.638
Let's just have one more.
Give me a cigarette!!

14:17.638 --> 14:19.505
No, wait! Robin, Robin,
think about this

14:19.505 --> 14:20.505
for a second.

14:20.505 --> 14:22.139
Bloomberg
is the antismoking mayor.

14:22.139 --> 14:23.705
Do you really want to show up

14:23.705 --> 14:25.204
to that interview
smelling like smoke?

14:25.204 --> 14:27.171
It'd be like interviewing
a vegetarian

14:27.171 --> 14:28.672
smelling like a McRib.

14:28.672 --> 14:30.972
Really? Like I'm not going
through enough right now?

14:30.972 --> 14:32.238
Look,

14:32.238 --> 14:33.238
you're quitting.

14:33.238 --> 14:35.672
We're all quitting.

14:36.805 --> 14:38.438
Fine. I'll quit.

14:38.438 --> 14:39.638
Great. Great.

14:39.638 --> 14:41.772
We just have to get
through the first 24 hours.

14:41.772 --> 14:43.371
After that, it's a cakewalk.

14:44.438 --> 14:47.238
Barney, do you have
to bite your nails so loud?

14:47.238 --> 14:48.471
I'm not biting
my nails.

14:48.471 --> 14:50.238
I'm trying to suck
the leftover nicotine

14:50.238 --> 14:51.638
out of my fingertips.

14:51.638 --> 14:53.405
Marshall, can you
pass the onion rings?

14:53.405 --> 14:55.039
What, you got dinosaur arms?
They're right there.

14:55.039 --> 14:57.638
What do you think cigarettes
are doing right now?

14:57.638 --> 14:59.972
You think they're
thinking about us?

14:59.972 --> 15:02.171
Dude, if you don't stop
tapping your foot,

15:02.171 --> 15:03.438
it's coming off.

15:03.438 --> 15:05.039
Oh, my God, Ted,
I'm so sorry.

15:05.039 --> 15:07.738
Maybe I should move it a
little bit closer to your ass!

15:07.738 --> 15:08.972
All right.

15:08.972 --> 15:11.039
I am ready to do this right now!

15:12.438 --> 15:14.405
None of us knew
what we were fighting about.

15:14.405 --> 15:15.972
We just knew
we wanted to smoke.

15:15.972 --> 15:19.105
More than anything
in the world.

15:23.872 --> 15:26.405
It wasn't going very well
for Robin, either.

15:26.405 --> 15:27.838
Sorry I'm late.

15:27.838 --> 15:30.738
Someone used the microwave,
and the elevator stopped.

15:30.738 --> 15:32.105
What are you doing?

15:32.105 --> 15:34.738
Okay, Don, Don,
seriously, not tonight.

15:34.738 --> 15:37.271
Okay, I'm a little bit on edge
because I quit smoking

15:37.271 --> 15:38.972
for my interview with
the mayor, so just...

15:40.105 --> 15:43.972
Oh, you precious little
porcelain unicorn, you.

15:43.972 --> 15:45.538
Why would you do that?

15:45.538 --> 15:47.238
Why?!

15:47.238 --> 15:49.905
Because I care, Don.

15:49.905 --> 15:53.105
I-I care about the show,
I-I care about my career.

15:53.105 --> 15:55.405
Unlike you,
you unprofessional jerk!

15:55.405 --> 15:57.672
You're-You're
sloppy, you're rude,

15:57.672 --> 16:00.072
and I wish you
worked half as hard

16:00.072 --> 16:02.571
as the elastic on those
stretched-out underpants.

16:03.772 --> 16:05.772
I'm starting to feel
like this is getting
a little personal.

16:05.772 --> 16:07.605
No, Don, it would be
getting personal

16:07.605 --> 16:09.471
if I would say
that the reason you bounce

16:09.471 --> 16:12.171
from market to market
is because you're a loser--

16:12.171 --> 16:13.338
a lazy,

16:13.338 --> 16:15.605
obnoxious, loser.

16:18.705 --> 16:20.171
The mayor canceled.

16:20.171 --> 16:22.672
In five, four,

16:22.672 --> 16:24.972
three, two...

16:27.972 --> 16:30.072
Hi, I'm Robin Scherbatsky.

16:30.072 --> 16:31.438
You think I'm a loser?

16:31.438 --> 16:33.171
You're' right. I'm a loser.

16:33.171 --> 16:34.872
But at least
I've accepted it.

16:34.872 --> 16:37.238
A plucky raccoon has been
cheering up patients

16:37.238 --> 16:39.072
at a local senior center.

16:39.072 --> 16:40.571
I used to be just like that.

16:40.571 --> 16:42.838
Always wanting more
and never getting it.

16:42.838 --> 16:44.972
It's a dead end, Robin.

16:46.139 --> 16:47.672
You're never going to be
a network anchor.

16:47.672 --> 16:50.571
Just like you're never
going to quit smoking.

16:50.571 --> 16:52.772
What are you doing?

16:52.772 --> 16:55.139
I'm enjoying a cigarette.

16:55.139 --> 16:57.005
Oh, that'll get you there.

16:57.972 --> 16:59.471
Oh, that's good.

16:59.471 --> 17:00.805
You want a drag?

17:00.805 --> 17:02.271
Can we be professionals?

17:02.271 --> 17:04.637
Please?
Yeah. Yeah, professionals?

17:04.637 --> 17:06.438
You know who's working
the camera right now?

17:06.438 --> 17:07.605
A chair.

17:07.605 --> 17:08.972
We're on a show

17:08.972 --> 17:11.039
where we can't even get
the cameraman to watch.

17:11.039 --> 17:12.570
That's why the mayor
canceled, Robin.

17:12.570 --> 17:14.704
And that's why Mike
is on a fried chicken run.

17:14.704 --> 17:16.805
And that's why you
and I can enjoy a cigarette

17:16.805 --> 17:18.338
right here on the air.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.238
No, thank you.

17:21.238 --> 17:23.005
Why?

17:23.005 --> 17:25.672
Because of our
millions and millions
of impressionable viewers?

17:25.672 --> 17:28.738
Okay... If any
impressionable viewers

17:28.738 --> 17:30.705
have a problem with this,
please give us a call.

17:30.705 --> 17:32.538
The number's on the screen.

17:34.805 --> 17:37.072
Chirp, chirp?
Chirp, chirp?

17:37.072 --> 17:39.204
Come on, Robin...

17:39.204 --> 17:40.738
live a little.

17:52.238 --> 17:53.772
Oh, that must be Mike.

17:53.772 --> 17:55.238
He always forgets--
extra crispy.

17:55.238 --> 17:56.338
Hello?

17:56.338 --> 17:57.638
Robin, don't smoke
that cigarette!

17:57.638 --> 17:58.605
Marshall?!

17:58.605 --> 17:59.805
We're all watching

17:59.805 --> 18:01.705
and we're all very
impressionable.

18:01.705 --> 18:03.139
And I swear to God,
if you smoke

18:03.139 --> 18:05.505
that cigarette,
we're all going to smoke.

18:06.805 --> 18:08.304
You...

18:08.304 --> 18:10.204
You guys are watching?

18:10.204 --> 18:13.438
We sure are, sweetheart,
and you look fabulous.

18:13.438 --> 18:15.204
Oh, you guys.

18:15.204 --> 18:17.271
You don't have
to do this, Robin.
You don't have to smoke.

18:17.271 --> 18:19.505
Resist it, honey.

18:19.505 --> 18:22.105
Thanks for the call, guys.

18:24.538 --> 18:26.338
Oh, she did it!

18:26.338 --> 18:27.505
Good for her.

18:27.505 --> 18:28.838
We're not going to smoke.

18:30.805 --> 18:33.972
I have a pack stashed
up on the roof.

18:38.039 --> 18:38.772
Uh-oh.

18:40.271 --> 18:43.204
I'm awake.
And I'm smoking!

18:43.204 --> 18:46.972
Robin, you know how dangerous
it is to wake a sleep smoker?

18:46.972 --> 18:48.672
It's fine.

18:48.672 --> 18:50.605
I bought a pack on my way home.

18:51.405 --> 18:52.805
Hey, great show, Robin.

18:52.805 --> 18:54.105
Yeah, but that

18:54.105 --> 18:55.605
Don guy, what a tool.

18:55.605 --> 18:58.204
Well, no, he actually
apologized to me.

18:58.204 --> 18:59.872
No, I mean when
he stood up.

18:59.872 --> 19:01.872
Those briefs were
pretty revealing.

19:01.872 --> 19:03.371
You should date that guy.

19:03.371 --> 19:05.204
Yeah.
Not in this lifetime.

19:05.204 --> 19:07.338
They were dating
within two months.

19:07.338 --> 19:08.705
But more on that later.

19:08.705 --> 19:11.538
Hey, guys, look,
the sun's coming up.

19:14.705 --> 19:17.105
You know what right now
is a perfect time for?

19:17.105 --> 19:19.505
A last cigarette ever.

19:19.505 --> 19:20.471
No, I mean,

19:20.471 --> 19:23.638
a real last cigarette ever.

19:25.872 --> 19:27.304
Damn it, let's do it.

19:27.304 --> 19:29.238
Okay.

19:30.672 --> 19:32.204
All right.

19:32.204 --> 19:33.805
Last cigarette ever

19:33.805 --> 19:35.471
on, uh, on the count of three.

19:35.471 --> 19:38.139
One...
Two...

19:38.139 --> 19:39.405
Three.

19:39.405 --> 19:40.805
We all quit for a while after that.

19:40.805 --> 19:44.039
But it wasn't anyone's last cigarette.

19:44.039 --> 19:47.238
But we did eventually
all quit smoking for real.

19:47.238 --> 19:51.139
Robin's last cigarette
was in June 2013.

19:51.139 --> 19:55.438
Barney's last cigarette
was in March 2017.

19:55.438 --> 19:57.105
Lily's last cigarette
was the day

19:57.105 --> 19:59.438
she started trying
to get pregnant.

19:59.438 --> 20:00.905
And Marshall's last cigarette

20:00.905 --> 20:03.738
was the day
his son was born.

20:03.738 --> 20:05.304
And my last cigarette?

20:05.304 --> 20:08.338
Two weeks into dating
your mother.

20:08.339 --> 20:09.972
And i never looked back.

20:22.150 --> 20:23.783
I'm sorry I hit you, buddy.

20:23.783 --> 20:24.751
I wanted to make it

20:24.751 --> 20:27.183
up to you,
by giving you this.

20:28.783 --> 20:30.450
Wow, she's hot!

20:30.450 --> 20:34.384
Yeah. Well... some day,
you're going to marry her.

20:34.384 --> 20:35.651
No way.

20:35.651 --> 20:37.916
We're pretty lucky.

20:37.916 --> 20:40.150
Totally.

20:40.150 --> 20:41.517
I'll be in my tent.

20:44.083 --> 20:45.983
Oh, no. Wait, hey!

20:45.983 --> 20:47.651
No, don't, don't do that.

20:51.017 --> 20:52.850
Well...

20:52.850 --> 20:55.020
have fun for me.

20:55.021 --> 21:05.800
