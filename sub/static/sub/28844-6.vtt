00:06.344 --> 00:10.758
[music]

00:18.206 --> 00:19.517
- All these cows are heifers.

00:22.758 --> 00:25.103
- Jamie.

00:25.172 --> 00:27.379
- Ever think about what you want
to be when you grow older?

00:29.448 --> 00:30.896
- You.

00:30.965 --> 00:33.724
- [laughs]

00:33.793 --> 00:36.551
I mean as a job.

00:36.620 --> 00:38.551
- I always figured one
day I'd do your job.

00:44.586 --> 00:46.620
- Take a look at that.

00:53.758 --> 00:55.000
- Harvard?

00:57.241 --> 00:59.413
- Congratulations, son.

00:59.482 --> 01:01.068
- I didn't apply to Harvard.

01:01.137 --> 01:03.379
- I applied for you.

01:03.448 --> 01:04.827
It's a great honor.
And you earned it.

01:04.896 --> 01:07.655
You busted your ass in school
and this is your reward.

01:07.724 --> 01:10.034
- Where's Harvard,
Connecticut?

01:10.103 --> 01:12.620
- Boston.

01:12.689 --> 01:14.965
- That's...that's really far.

01:15.034 --> 01:17.379
- You wanna be me someday?

01:17.448 --> 01:21.517
Then become something that can
help me protect this place.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.137
- What do you want me to become?

01:27.206 --> 01:28.827
- A lawyer.

01:28.896 --> 01:32.034
- You always say that
you don't respect lawyers.

01:32.103 --> 01:34.517
- Well, then become
one that I can.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.862
- Why a lawyer?

01:40.620 --> 01:44.103
- Lawyers are the swords
of this century.

01:44.172 --> 01:46.896
Words are weapons now.

01:46.965 --> 01:49.827
I need you to learn
how to use 'em.

02:02.275 --> 02:05.068
- You don't deserve this...

02:31.965 --> 02:35.655
- I suppose I'm to blame
for you being so angry

02:35.724 --> 02:39.137
you'd want to hurt me ...

02:39.206 --> 02:41.310
But it's not me you hurt.

02:41.379 --> 02:42.965
It's your brother
and your sister.

02:43.034 --> 02:44.310
Sit down.

02:50.172 --> 02:51.827
You understand it's
as much their future

02:51.896 --> 02:54.000
you've risked
as it is your own.

02:54.068 --> 02:58.103
- Yeah. If I could just...

02:58.172 --> 02:59.655
- If you could just what?

02:59.724 --> 03:03.068
Explain?

03:03.137 --> 03:05.379
What do you want to explain,
Jamie?

03:05.448 --> 03:08.517
- Well, I um...

03:08.586 --> 03:10.620
I didn't tell her everything.

03:14.310 --> 03:18.275
- You don't get it.
You gave her a thread.

03:18.344 --> 03:22.068
And she can weave it
into whatever she wants.

03:22.137 --> 03:23.620
- Now, you'd better get
with her and find out

03:23.689 --> 03:27.103
exactly what it is she wants,
you understand?

03:27.172 --> 03:29.275
And if what she wants
is ruining this ranch

03:29.344 --> 03:33.000
with some story about me,

03:33.068 --> 03:37.896
then you act
like my fucking lawyer

03:37.965 --> 03:39.448
and sue her
and her fucking magazine

03:39.517 --> 03:42.034
right back to New York,
you understand?

03:49.724 --> 03:53.379
[theme music]

04:54.862 --> 04:57.758
- So this is what an Ivy League
education can get you?

04:57.827 --> 05:02.517
- No, this you have to take.

05:02.586 --> 05:04.413
- It's a lot nicer
than I expected.

05:04.482 --> 05:08.379
- Yeah. And he did
all this with no money.

05:11.758 --> 05:13.896
- Sorry to keep you waiting.

05:19.103 --> 05:21.172
How can I help you?

05:23.620 --> 05:25.793
- The sound of a casino
making money

05:25.862 --> 05:28.586
is not cards flipping.

05:28.655 --> 05:31.655
It's slots ringing ...

05:31.724 --> 05:33.655
Little soothing
chimes and bells

05:33.724 --> 05:37.137
with no particular rhythm
but certainly a harmony.

05:37.206 --> 05:40.551
And all of them--
each one--

05:40.620 --> 05:45.413
in the universally
pleasing key of 'C.'

05:45.482 --> 05:47.586
- I know how a casino works.

05:47.655 --> 05:50.344
And the cards flipping
make a difference.

05:52.482 --> 05:55.172
My best croupier.

05:55.241 --> 05:57.172
Even with nine
and a half fingers.

05:57.241 --> 06:00.517
He makes more than a row of gas
station slots in a week.

06:00.586 --> 06:03.034
So, let's skip to the part
where you talk to me

06:03.103 --> 06:06.068
about my casino
in Paradise Valley.

06:07.862 --> 06:12.275
- Hm. Dan Jenkins.

06:15.482 --> 06:17.758
What value does he provide
you at this point?

06:17.827 --> 06:20.758
You already took his land.

06:20.827 --> 06:22.896
- Whatever it is you
think you're get from Jenkins,

06:22.965 --> 06:25.034
you'll get better from us.

06:25.103 --> 06:26.413
- I'm not looking for partners.

06:26.482 --> 06:29.655
- And yet, you have one.

06:29.724 --> 06:31.758
- Jenkins is worthless to you.

06:31.827 --> 06:34.655
We, however, can offer you
something of real value.

06:34.724 --> 06:37.896
- I'm breathless
with anticipation.

06:37.965 --> 06:40.310
- Slots.

06:40.379 --> 06:42.068
- Only available
through our leasing company.

06:44.896 --> 06:48.034
- Extorting a public
official in his office.

06:48.103 --> 06:50.275
With three witnesses...

06:50.344 --> 06:52.206
How convenient for me.

06:52.275 --> 06:55.206
- We're not obligated to lease
out equipment to anyone,

06:55.275 --> 07:00.034
Chairman, we're simply
offering you our expertise.

07:00.103 --> 07:02.620
- The contractors,
the communities,

07:02.689 --> 07:04.793
the Dan Jenkinses.

07:04.862 --> 07:07.827
John Dutton.

07:07.896 --> 07:11.448
Whatever it is,
we know how to negotiate it.

07:11.517 --> 07:14.448
Make it stay far away.

07:14.517 --> 07:16.206
You're 18 months
from needing slot machines.

07:16.275 --> 07:18.724
You have plenty of problems
to face before that one.

07:18.793 --> 07:20.689
- The last thing
we want to see is a casino

07:20.758 --> 07:22.137
the size of the fucking Wynn

07:22.206 --> 07:24.068
on the north gate of the
Yellowstone National Park.

07:26.586 --> 07:30.517
- And we will fuck you
at every turn, Thomas.

07:30.586 --> 07:32.586
Unless we have a reason
to support it.

07:32.655 --> 07:36.758
And right now, we don't.

07:36.827 --> 07:40.275
I suggest you give us one.

07:40.344 --> 07:44.000
- I feel an 'or else' coming.

07:45.896 --> 07:47.827
- You bet your ass it's coming.

07:55.758 --> 07:57.172
- Ladies.

08:02.586 --> 08:05.275
- Stirring hornets' nests
all over.

08:05.344 --> 08:07.862
- They're all so scared, Mo.

08:07.931 --> 08:10.724
They got good reason to be.

08:42.793 --> 08:44.689
- Watch how he does it.

08:44.758 --> 08:49.137
This is the next thing
you need to learn.

08:49.206 --> 08:51.586
- What I need to do
is make some extra money.

08:59.517 --> 09:02.344
- What the hell kind
of trouble you in, kid?

09:06.068 --> 09:07.827
- The kind it
takes money to fix.

09:12.206 --> 09:15.965
- There's a buckin' horse
fraternity at the fairground.

09:16.034 --> 09:19.586
You stay on for eight,
you'll pull a check.

09:19.655 --> 09:21.000
Sitting on a buckin' horse

09:21.068 --> 09:23.793
is the only thing I've
seen you do well, Jimmy.

09:23.862 --> 09:25.344
- Yeah, I was fuckin'
taped to it.

09:25.413 --> 09:28.068
- [laughs]

09:28.137 --> 09:31.310
- Think tape can keep
you in the saddle?

09:31.379 --> 09:34.793
You fall off 'em when
they're running straight,

09:34.862 --> 09:37.103
you stick to 'em
when they break in two.

09:37.172 --> 09:39.620
Maybe that's your talent, Jimmy.

09:39.689 --> 09:41.137
- How much does
it cost to enter?

09:41.206 --> 09:42.310
- Couple hundred.

09:42.379 --> 09:45.103
But you can win a few grand.

09:45.172 --> 09:49.000
- I don't have a couple
hundred to spare.

09:49.068 --> 09:50.793
- I'll spot you.

09:52.793 --> 09:55.034
- Why would you do that?

09:59.344 --> 10:00.620
- Why do you think?

10:04.620 --> 10:06.310
- This one's done.

10:06.379 --> 10:08.586
- Lloyd. Ready for another.

10:08.655 --> 10:10.206
- Go get us another horse.

10:30.068 --> 10:33.000
- The balls on this
son of a bitch.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.310
Quite the about-face
on the news.

10:51.379 --> 10:53.827
You accepting responsibility
for something.

10:53.896 --> 10:57.275
Not like you these days.

10:57.344 --> 10:59.275
- You in business
with the Beck brothers now?

10:59.344 --> 11:03.517
- Yeah, I'm putting...

11:03.586 --> 11:05.068
I'm putting slot machines
in my barn.

11:05.137 --> 11:06.586
- Look, it's not a fuckin' joke.

11:06.655 --> 11:08.379
Once they get screws
in you, John,

11:08.448 --> 11:09.379
they never take them out.

11:09.448 --> 11:11.137
Now, we can have
our differences,

11:11.206 --> 11:13.379
but we want them nowhere
near this valley.

11:14.862 --> 11:16.931
- How'd they get screws in you?

11:17.000 --> 11:20.172
- I got in pretty deep
at one of their casinos, John.

11:20.241 --> 11:23.793
- And?

11:23.862 --> 11:25.586
- I couldn't cover the debt.

11:28.758 --> 11:30.137
- And?

11:30.206 --> 11:32.344
- Then they came up
with ways that I could.

11:35.034 --> 11:37.862
- And now they own you.

11:37.931 --> 11:42.000
- I'm giving the man who used
to be my friend some advice.

11:42.068 --> 11:46.931
Now, you're on their radar.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.862
For the love of God,
find a way off it, John.

11:49.931 --> 11:51.413
- I never stopped being
your friend, Donnie.

11:51.482 --> 11:52.793
You stopped being mine.

11:56.827 --> 11:58.689
I suggest you start
being my friend again,

11:58.758 --> 12:01.586
big fella,
because as you can see,

12:01.655 --> 12:03.862
the walls are closing in
on all sides.

12:14.482 --> 12:17.206
- When you do this in the rodeo,
ain't no saddle.

12:17.275 --> 12:21.655
Just you, your rigging,
and the horse.

12:21.724 --> 12:23.241
But for now...

12:23.310 --> 12:25.620
let's just see if you
can stay in the saddle.

12:38.793 --> 12:41.137
- Hell yeah!
Jimmy, there you go.

12:41.206 --> 12:44.137
One, two, three,
keep riding!

12:44.206 --> 12:48.172
Four, five, six, seven,
honk!

12:48.241 --> 12:49.517
[laughs]

12:49.586 --> 12:53.206
Jump off.

12:53.275 --> 12:55.137
You're a winner.

12:55.206 --> 12:57.344
- Rip, you see that?
Eight seconds.

12:57.413 --> 13:01.931
- Yeah, Jimmy.
I saw.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.862
Why is he on
that rank bastard?

13:04.931 --> 13:06.586
- Needs to make
some extra money.

13:06.655 --> 13:09.551
Gonna have his go at the rodeo.

13:09.620 --> 13:12.241
- He can barely
sit on the broke ones, Lloyd.

13:12.310 --> 13:15.482
You're gonna get
the fucking kid killed.

13:15.551 --> 13:17.862
- He sit him pretty good.

13:17.931 --> 13:20.068
- Hey Jimmy.

13:20.137 --> 13:23.000
You know why you never
met an old rodeo cowboys?

13:24.137 --> 13:25.551
'Cause there aren't any.

13:25.620 --> 13:27.103
- I'm old.

13:27.172 --> 13:29.448
- You just look old.

13:29.517 --> 13:31.586
- Yeah, I won't die,
I promise.

13:31.655 --> 13:32.965
- I'll hold you to that.

13:33.034 --> 13:36.862
Hey. Make sure
he don't get hurt now.

13:36.931 --> 13:38.413
- What's next?

13:38.482 --> 13:40.310
- We get you in a bucking chute.

13:48.103 --> 13:50.137
- Thank you.

13:51.965 --> 13:54.034
Hi
- Hi.

13:54.103 --> 13:55.586
- Dan Jenkins' office.

13:55.655 --> 14:00.034
- Uh, do you have
an appointment?

14:00.103 --> 14:03.068
- Not what I asked...

14:09.896 --> 14:12.689
- Stop right ther--
Ahh!

14:19.655 --> 14:22.689
- Fuck!

14:24.172 --> 14:26.034
- Do you know what
a fucking mess

14:26.103 --> 14:27.172
you've made in this valley?

14:27.241 --> 14:28.689
- I didn't kill
your fucking cattle.

14:28.758 --> 14:30.137
- I know.

14:30.206 --> 14:35.034
The Beck brothers did it
so I'd turn on you.

14:35.103 --> 14:36.448
They did it because
you're building

14:36.517 --> 14:38.793
the biggest casino
outside of Vegas

14:38.862 --> 14:41.482
right against my goddamn fence.

14:41.551 --> 14:43.517
And if that's
what they're gonna do to me,

14:43.586 --> 14:47.310
God knows what they're
going to do to you.

14:47.379 --> 14:51.620
So you and I find ourselves
in an interesting situation.

14:51.689 --> 14:54.482
- It's not my casino anymore.

14:54.551 --> 14:56.620
Rainwater is pushing me out.

14:56.689 --> 14:59.034
The Beck Brothers
are pushing their way in.

14:59.103 --> 15:01.000
A little late.

15:01.068 --> 15:03.137
Wait outside.

15:08.931 --> 15:12.103
- I think you,
Mister Rainwater, and I

15:12.172 --> 15:15.758
should all sit down
and clear the air.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
- I can arrange that.

15:25.551 --> 15:26.793
- Thank you.

15:29.931 --> 15:31.413
- That was a nice move.

15:31.482 --> 15:32.931
- Wasn't a move.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.413
I'm just meaner than you.

15:35.482 --> 15:37.275
- So this thing'll buck, Jake?

15:37.344 --> 15:39.379
- Curtis been hauling
him all year long,

15:39.448 --> 15:42.172
nobody ride him
for eight seconds yet.

15:42.241 --> 15:44.103
- Just stay on this one
for eight seconds

15:44.172 --> 15:45.551
and we'll get you to a rodeo.

15:45.620 --> 15:48.172
- I just...climb on?

15:48.241 --> 15:50.000
- We'll set the rigging,
then you climb on.

15:51.793 --> 15:54.172
Now this horse is bred
to get you off his back.

15:54.241 --> 15:55.448
- Is there like
a mechanical bull

15:55.517 --> 15:58.275
or something I can try
out first? Just--

15:58.344 --> 16:02.103
- Mechanical bulls are for
drunk girls at the county fair.

16:02.172 --> 16:03.758
If you gonna rodeo,

16:03.827 --> 16:06.448
you need to find out
if you got the stomach for it.

16:06.517 --> 16:08.379
Now, get on him.

16:11.655 --> 16:14.758
Keep your heels
mashed on his neck, Jimmy.

16:14.827 --> 16:16.137
I'm gonna fix your hand
in that rigging

16:16.206 --> 16:18.655
where you have to take it out.
All right?

16:18.724 --> 16:20.655
I'd rather you get hung up
and dragged around the arena,

16:20.724 --> 16:22.862
than get blown out the backdoor
and get your head kicked in.

16:25.862 --> 16:27.931
Ethan, you ready?

16:28.000 --> 16:31.275
Okay. Stick your chest out
and tuck your chin.

16:31.344 --> 16:32.931
Jake. Pull it ...

16:33.000 --> 16:35.344
- Jeez!

16:36.551 --> 16:38.896
Ahhh! Ahhh!

16:38.965 --> 16:40.310
- Mash your heels in!

16:44.965 --> 16:48.482
- Kid's a natural.
That's eight.

16:48.551 --> 16:50.206
- Get him, Ethan!

16:53.413 --> 16:56.758
- Let go, we got you.

16:56.827 --> 16:59.551
- Shit, f--

16:59.620 --> 17:00.965
That was incredible!

17:01.034 --> 17:02.482
- Yeehaw!

17:02.551 --> 17:06.931
We finally found something
you can do well.

17:07.000 --> 17:10.896
You'll be up to your neck
in buckle bunnies in no time.

17:10.964 --> 17:12.827
- Wait, what's a buckle bunny?

17:12.896 --> 17:15.723
- You'll be finding
out soon enough,

17:23.964 --> 17:25.413
- Jesus Christ.

17:25.482 --> 17:27.931
Where the fuck are we?

17:32.206 --> 17:34.517
This chicken shit.

17:42.827 --> 17:47.241
Now, there's paranoid,
and then there's this.

17:47.310 --> 17:49.413
Being seen with me in a diner

17:49.482 --> 17:52.482
won't damn you
with the community, Jamie.

17:52.551 --> 17:55.137
- I'm already damned.

17:55.206 --> 17:56.586
- Okay look,

17:56.655 --> 17:58.517
you're not the first source
to have second thoughts.

17:58.586 --> 18:01.310
But we're way past that point.

18:01.379 --> 18:04.275
- Sarah, I'm an attorney.

18:04.344 --> 18:07.551
I am rescinding my permission
to be quoted---

18:07.620 --> 18:11.724
I'm sure they covered the First
Amendment in law school.

18:11.793 --> 18:13.620
I don't need your permission.

18:13.689 --> 18:14.862
- Listen...
I was angry.

18:14.931 --> 18:16.758
The things I said weren't true.

18:16.827 --> 18:19.862
Some things I said violate
attorney-client privilege.

18:19.931 --> 18:22.310
I could be disbarred...

18:22.379 --> 18:23.965
I could be disowned...

18:24.034 --> 18:26.034
This doesn't just hurt me--
this hurts my family,

18:26.103 --> 18:27.310
this hurts my sister

18:27.379 --> 18:29.379
- Oh yeah,
what a lovely woman---

18:29.448 --> 18:31.724
- My brother--
- The killer?

18:31.793 --> 18:33.241
You mean that brother?

18:33.310 --> 18:34.931
- My family could be ruined.

18:37.275 --> 18:40.551
- Your father's ranch
isn't a kingdom, Jamie.

18:40.620 --> 18:43.034
And he isn't a king.

18:43.103 --> 18:45.482
And you...

18:45.551 --> 18:48.379
Running for an office
that allows you

18:48.448 --> 18:51.103
to rewrite the rules
to your father's liking?

18:51.172 --> 18:55.344
Your family deserves
to lose everything.

18:58.896 --> 19:02.000
I can't tell you
the pleasure it gives me

19:02.068 --> 19:05.620
to be the one taking it.

19:05.689 --> 19:08.862
No man should
have this much land.

19:08.931 --> 19:11.827
It should be a park
or a game preserve.

19:15.172 --> 19:17.689
And when I'm done,
maybe it will.

19:44.551 --> 19:46.448
- Oh, fuck...

19:46.517 --> 19:48.758
Oh, what the fuck, Jamie?
Fuck!

19:50.413 --> 19:52.965
Fuck fuck fuck!

19:53.034 --> 19:55.517
Fuck!

20:11.103 --> 20:15.827
- [groans]

20:15.896 --> 20:19.137
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

20:19.206 --> 20:23.310
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry!

20:23.379 --> 20:28.000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry...
No...

20:44.896 --> 20:47.413
Ahhhh!

21:01.241 --> 21:03.137
- What happened?

21:07.103 --> 21:10.241
Jamie, what happened?

21:18.448 --> 21:21.586
- I don't know what happened
It just...

21:21.655 --> 21:23.068
All went wrong.

21:26.379 --> 21:28.827
What do we do?

21:28.896 --> 21:30.620
- Let me talk to your father.

21:30.689 --> 21:33.000
- No. Rip, no.

21:34.793 --> 21:36.000
- I don't work for you.
- Yeah...

21:36.068 --> 21:38.482
- I don't work for you.
- I know, okay.

21:38.551 --> 21:41.379
- If you tell him, then
he's an accessory to murder.

21:41.448 --> 21:45.103
Right now, the only person
accountable is me.

21:45.172 --> 21:47.724
We need to keep it that way.

21:50.344 --> 21:51.793
- Jamie, I'm just
a wrangler now.

21:51.862 --> 21:53.241
Kayce has my job.

21:55.586 --> 21:57.275
- Rip, please...

21:57.344 --> 21:59.206
As a friend.

21:59.275 --> 22:03.827
I've always treated you
like an equal.

22:03.896 --> 22:06.379
Like a friend.

22:15.655 --> 22:18.931
- Yeah...
You have.

22:19.000 --> 22:22.517
- It didn't even
feel like my hands.

22:22.586 --> 22:23.620
It was like...

22:23.689 --> 22:27.206
like I was above, watching it.

22:27.275 --> 22:29.586
And I don't know
what to do.

22:29.655 --> 22:33.103
- Okay. Stay here.
Don't move.

22:39.793 --> 22:42.965
- Working hard as usual, I see.

22:45.310 --> 22:47.586
- Give me something to do,
Rip, I'll do it.

22:47.655 --> 22:49.586
- I got something for you.

22:49.655 --> 22:53.206
- I meant ranch work.

22:53.275 --> 22:55.379
- All I need you to do
is drive a car, Walker.

22:55.448 --> 22:57.241
Can you drive a car for me?

22:57.310 --> 22:59.655
- Yeah, I can drive a fucking
car for you, Rip.

23:02.551 --> 23:04.344
- Thank you.

23:17.551 --> 23:20.413
You know Jamie,
at some point,

23:20.482 --> 23:22.517
the only way to get
rid of the mess

23:22.586 --> 23:25.931
is to get rid of you.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.034
Don't put me in that position.

23:50.758 --> 23:53.172
- Go jump in that car.
Follow me.

24:42.517 --> 24:45.000
- Can you help?

24:45.068 --> 24:47.551
- I ain't fucking touching
that thing.

24:47.620 --> 24:49.241
Go on.

25:23.310 --> 25:25.931
- Jamie?

25:26.000 --> 25:29.620
Where's her phone?

25:29.689 --> 25:31.517
Give it to me.

25:46.689 --> 25:48.827
- All right. Let's go.

26:07.275 --> 26:09.103
- Say, whose car is this?

26:09.172 --> 26:12.655
- It's nobody's.
Get in.

26:26.793 --> 26:30.655
- You just made me an accessory
to murder, didn't you, Rip?

26:30.724 --> 26:33.517
- What do you mean "accessory"?

26:33.586 --> 26:35.482
Our prints aren't
in that rental car.

26:35.551 --> 26:37.103
I didn't load a kayak

26:37.172 --> 26:39.655
and a bunch of other shit
in the back of a pickup.

26:39.724 --> 26:41.931
You did.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.517
- Motherfucker...

26:44.586 --> 26:47.965
- That's to keep
your whining mouth shut.

26:48.034 --> 26:49.931
You want off this ranch?
You got it.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.275
When we get back
I'll drive your ass

26:51.344 --> 26:53.172
to the train station myself.

26:53.241 --> 26:55.206
- You ain't fuckin'
drivin' me anywhere.

26:55.275 --> 26:56.896
I'll walk from the ranch.

26:56.965 --> 26:59.206
- No, I want to watch you
leave this state.

26:59.275 --> 27:03.068
Look at me motherfucker.
I want to see it.

27:27.241 --> 27:28.379
- All right, stop.

27:28.448 --> 27:29.724
Stop, stop, stop.

27:29.793 --> 27:32.275
- What's the matter?

27:32.344 --> 27:35.379
- I'm sorry.
I can't do this.

27:35.448 --> 27:39.689
Could you, um...
Could you leave, please?

27:39.758 --> 27:42.275
- I don't understand.

27:42.344 --> 27:43.448
If I did something wrong.

27:43.517 --> 27:46.827
- It's not you.
I just needed closure.

27:51.241 --> 27:55.586
- Doesn't look like
you want closure.

27:55.655 --> 27:56.896
He a bad man?

27:56.965 --> 27:59.275
- No. He's a good man.

27:59.344 --> 28:02.172
He's just done some bad things.

28:02.241 --> 28:05.655
- Who hasn't?

28:05.724 --> 28:08.413
- He's going to break my heart.

28:08.482 --> 28:10.103
And my son's.

28:10.172 --> 28:13.000
I know it.

28:14.862 --> 28:17.034
- I think your heart
is broken already.

28:22.137 --> 28:25.275
And you're the one breaking it.

28:36.965 --> 28:39.655
It's not my place
to say, but...

28:39.724 --> 28:42.310
If a thing is gonna die,
it's gonna die.

28:42.379 --> 28:43.965
But to kill it so you don't
have to go through the pain

28:44.034 --> 28:46.931
of watching it die?

28:47.000 --> 28:49.241
Well, now it's dead
and you're the killer.

28:49.310 --> 28:50.793
You suffer twice.

28:54.172 --> 28:56.793
You're the one breaking hearts,

35:25.862 --> 35:28.275
- Wouldn't go in there
for 10 or 15 minutes

35:28.344 --> 35:29.862
if I was you boys.

35:29.931 --> 35:31.758
- You're even walking different.

35:31.827 --> 35:33.620
- I felt different.

35:34.758 --> 35:36.586
- You lost ten pounds.

35:36.655 --> 35:38.206
- I like it.
I just need a beer.

35:38.275 --> 35:39.965
- No, you need a fuckin' bath.

35:40.034 --> 35:41.379
- I don't smell that bad.

35:41.448 --> 35:43.931
- Nasty ass.

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
- Adios, assholes.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.620
- Jesus boys, it looks
like leaving this place

35:53.689 --> 35:55.000
is getting contagious, huh?

36:08.413 --> 36:10.896
- Where's he going?

36:15.000 --> 36:16.206
I'll get my coat.

36:28.000 --> 36:29.758
- What's going on?

36:29.827 --> 36:31.551
- He's done.

36:31.620 --> 36:33.655
- Says who?
- Says me.

36:35.000 --> 36:36.310
- Where you takin' him?

36:36.379 --> 36:37.965
- I don't know.

36:38.034 --> 36:40.827
Said he's gonna take me
to the train station.

36:40.896 --> 36:43.034
Recon I'll figure
it out from there.

36:45.655 --> 36:47.344
- I'll take you.

36:47.413 --> 36:49.862
Go on.

36:49.931 --> 36:52.413
- You don't know
where it is, Kayce.

36:56.068 --> 36:59.034
- I know exactly where it is.

37:02.137 --> 37:03.551
Come on.

37:35.931 --> 37:37.724
- What'd you do?

37:40.000 --> 37:41.655
- I told you.

37:41.724 --> 37:43.827
It's what I won't do.

37:43.896 --> 37:45.689
- What did he ask you to do?

37:45.758 --> 37:48.103
- That's between us.

38:15.758 --> 38:19.620
People like to think
we ain't animals.

38:19.689 --> 38:22.000
Like we've evolved
into something different.

38:23.896 --> 38:27.620
Prison teaches you real quick,
we haven't.

38:27.689 --> 38:30.758
you can forget bears
and wolves, snakes--

38:30.827 --> 38:33.965
all that shit.

38:34.034 --> 38:36.275
We're the meanest fucking
thing on this planet.

38:38.758 --> 38:40.310
Of all the animals
in the kingdom,

38:40.379 --> 38:43.758
we're the fuckin' worst.

38:43.827 --> 38:46.655
- Yeah. I know.

38:46.724 --> 38:49.310
- I'm just trying to do things
a lil different, that's all.

38:51.620 --> 38:53.344
- Yeah, me too.

38:56.034 --> 38:57.379
- This ain't different.

39:04.068 --> 39:06.310
- You want different?

39:06.379 --> 39:09.206
What's your word worth?

39:09.275 --> 39:13.689
- Worth my life.

39:13.758 --> 39:15.034
- You give me your word

39:15.103 --> 39:16.724
that everything you saw
and heard on this ranch

39:16.793 --> 39:19.275
stays with you.

39:19.344 --> 39:21.413
And I'll give you my word
the next time you come through,

39:21.482 --> 39:24.586
I'll be running it.
And I'll run it different.

39:24.655 --> 39:27.758
And you'll be
welcomed back anytime.

39:32.620 --> 39:34.724
- Yeah.

39:34.793 --> 39:37.034
I reckon I oughta stay away
from here for a while.

39:38.758 --> 39:41.000
- I'd recommend it.

39:50.275 --> 39:53.413
- I won't forget this.

39:53.482 --> 39:55.655
I owe you one.

39:55.724 --> 39:58.241
- Yeah.

39:58.310 --> 40:00.034
Knowing this world,

40:00.103 --> 40:03.862
I'm sure you'll get a chance
to return the favor.

40:11.620 --> 40:14.413
- Wear your long johns tomorrow.

40:14.482 --> 40:17.137
It's gonna be cold
in the morning.

40:17.206 --> 40:18.724
- The body has been identified

40:18.793 --> 40:20.655
as Sarah Nguyen from New York,

40:20.724 --> 40:23.758
and her death serves as a stark reminder of the dangers...

40:23.827 --> 40:26.482
- Why don't you run up stairs.
Try and get some sleep.

40:26.551 --> 40:28.310
- I'm too excited to sleep.

40:28.379 --> 40:31.413
- Yeah, me too,
now go on. Go.

40:31.482 --> 40:32.793
- Okay.

40:38.379 --> 40:41.000
- Miss Nguyen is the park's
third drowning victim

40:41.068 --> 40:43.413
this year, and seventh death
overall,

40:43.482 --> 40:46.931
earning 2019 a grim spot
in the record book.

40:47.000 --> 40:48.551
- Thank you for that.

40:48.620 --> 40:51.620
We will of course keep you
apprised of the situation.

40:51.689 --> 40:53.172
As new information--

41:35.689 --> 41:37.896
- Look at me.

41:40.827 --> 41:44.896
Look at me, son.

41:49.689 --> 41:52.000
How do we move on from this?

41:52.068 --> 41:54.068
I don't know how to do that.

42:00.241 --> 42:03.241
- I had no choice.

42:03.310 --> 42:07.000
- There's always a choice.

42:07.068 --> 42:11.448
You could've jumped
in the river.

42:11.517 --> 42:13.379
But hurting yourself
never entered your mind,

42:13.448 --> 42:15.206
did it?

42:24.482 --> 42:27.689
- The body has been identified
as Sarah Nguyen from New York,

42:27.758 --> 42:30.103
and her death serves
as a stark reminder

42:30.172 --> 42:33.413
of the dangers
of this section of river.

42:33.482 --> 42:36.758
Miss Nguyen is the park's third drowning victim this year,

42:36.827 --> 42:38.724
and seventh death overall,

42:38.793 --> 42:40.827
earning 2019 a grim spot...

42:52.137 --> 42:54.862
- All right,
let's go wake him up.

42:54.931 --> 42:58.068
Let's go to work.
Come on. Get up.

42:58.137 --> 42:59.827
Time to go. Get up.

It's not a trick question, Tate.

44:30.482 --> 44:34.344
You just gotta be sure
before you pull that trigger,

44:34.413 --> 44:37.689
because killing is the one
thing you can't undo.

44:42.379 --> 44:44.586

44:53.103 --> 44:54.551
- You see him through there?

44:56.344 --> 44:58.310
- Yeah.

44:58.379 --> 45:00.586
- Okay, I want you
to put those crosshairs

Pull the trigger real slow.

45:31.689 --> 45:33.000
Good shot!

45:48.206 --> 45:49.931
- Look at that.

45:54.482 --> 45:56.517
- That's bigger than
my first buck.

46:16.931 --> 46:19.172
- First deer.
We gotta blood you.

46:20.551 --> 46:23.862

46:23.931 --> 46:26.000

46:57.379 --> 46:59.586
- Hey.
It's all right.

47:03.482 --> 47:06.931
It's a big deal taking a life.

everything on this planet

does to survive, Tate.

47:25.241 --> 47:27.827
It's the one thing we all share.

47:27.896 --> 47:29.448
Now you share it, too.

47:32.000 --> 47:34.206
- Will something kill us too,
Grandpa?

47:37.931 --> 47:40.758
- Yeah, something
will kill us, too.

47:40.827 --> 47:45.655
Might be bacteria so small
you need a microscope to see it.

47:47.275 --> 47:50.448
Might be a big ol' bear.

47:50.517 --> 47:54.241
There's no such thing
