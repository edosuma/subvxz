Tonight, Compo takes me for a spin
in a car from his youth,

00:17.351 --> 00:20.843
Richard tries to drive a fast car
without crashing,

00:20.921 --> 00:24.049
and Lewis Hamilton faces his toughest test yet,

00:24.124 --> 00:26.217
the Suzuki Liana.

00:31.765 --> 00:33.357
(Whistling and cheering)

00:33.434 --> 00:35.959
Thank you very much. Thank you, thank you.

00:37.304 --> 00:42.332
Hello, and welcome to the BMW M5
which is very expensive.

00:43.611 --> 00:47.809
However, I know of a car which does
all the same sort of stuff for half the price.

00:47.881 --> 00:52.614
So that's got to be worth a look,
even though it is a bit... Australian.

00:56.490 --> 00:59.118
Welcome, everyone, to the VXR8.

01:00.561 --> 01:04.964
Like the M5, it's a spacious four-door,
five-seater saloon car,

01:05.032 --> 01:08.798
with much leather,
many buttons and a large boot.

01:11.171 --> 01:15.232
Like the M5, it'll bumble about all day
quietly and comfortably.

01:18.212 --> 01:21.579
And, like the M5, it's capable,
when the mood takes you,

01:21.649 --> 01:25.813
of being absolutely and completely bonkers.

01:34.662 --> 01:39.224
This could only have come from a country
that hadn't signed up to the Kyoto Treaty.

01:42.836 --> 01:48.502
For such a big, comfortable car,
it's staggeringly easy to drive very...

01:48.575 --> 01:50.270
...really fast.

01:56.183 --> 01:58.879
It's got a six-liter V8.

01:58.952 --> 02:02.046
That's 414 horsepower.

02:05.159 --> 02:08.185
Naught to sixty? Less than five seconds.

02:09.395 --> 02:12.388
Its top speed, if you take the limiter off,

02:12.466 --> 02:14.434
about 175.

02:15.135 --> 02:17.000
And that's pretty quick.

02:17.705 --> 02:21.232
And it's yours for just L35,000.

02:23.243 --> 02:26.007
Now, for that sort of money,
what you'd normally be looking at

02:26.080 --> 02:28.742
is a three-liter BMW 5 series,

02:28.816 --> 02:31.614
or a 3.2- Liter Audi A6,

02:31.685 --> 02:34.381
or a 2.8- Liter Mercedes E class.

02:34.455 --> 02:36.514
They're all very nice cars, they really are,

02:36.590 --> 02:41.425
but they're not really in the same league
as the big V8.

02:54.074 --> 02:57.771
They're all lost in my six-liter shockwave.

02:58.712 --> 03:02.079
In a simple drag race,
it completely trounces them.

03:06.687 --> 03:10.123
And we see much the same thing
in the corners.

03:14.895 --> 03:16.988
Out of the way, Germans!

03:18.699 --> 03:20.064
Thank you.

03:21.602 --> 03:27.507
This, then, delivers M5 power games
for L30,000 less.

03:27.574 --> 03:29.735
So what exactly are you missing out on?

03:32.446 --> 03:36.906
Well, first of all,
the BMW comes with a BMW badge,

03:36.984 --> 03:40.181
and that is worth its weight in myrrh.

03:40.254 --> 03:43.417
Whereas this is being sold in Britain

03:43.490 --> 03:45.981
as a Vauxhall.

03:48.429 --> 03:53.799
What's more, inside,
it's a bit like a Currys own-brand stereo.

03:55.836 --> 04:01.741
And of course, with such a big engine,
it's not what you'd call economical.

04:03.710 --> 04:05.678
And then there's the exterior.

04:05.746 --> 04:09.375
With all its trinketry
and Price Drop TVjewelry,

04:09.450 --> 04:11.179
it's not exactly a wallflower.

04:13.353 --> 04:18.950
But the main reason why
this is L30,000 cheaper than an M5 is simple.

04:19.026 --> 04:22.587
It's about 30,000 times less complicated.

04:26.467 --> 04:32.599
In an M5, there are seven different settings for
the gearbox. There are two for the differential.

04:32.673 --> 04:36.473
You can even choose
how much power you want from the engine.

04:36.543 --> 04:41.344
It's like a Poggenpohl kitchen.
It's very hi-tech, very German, very nice.

04:42.015 --> 04:45.542
This, though... This is more like a barbie.

04:47.521 --> 04:51.252
Honestly, I'm surprised you don't pour beer on it
when you want to turn it off.

04:52.426 --> 04:55.884
You push the middle pedal
when you want it to slow down,

04:55.963 --> 05:00.263
you turn this big, circular thing in front of you
to make it go round corners,

05:02.069 --> 05:04.537
and then you push the pedal on the right

05:06.740 --> 05:08.640
when you want it to make more noise.

05:14.781 --> 05:18.547
This car, then,
it's as dainty as a hobnail boot,

05:18.619 --> 05:21.110
as feminine as a burst sausage.

05:21.188 --> 05:25.022
And I've got to say, I love it.

14:27.129 --> 14:32.226
Erm... You see, every week we get a stack
of letters, and literally none of them ever asks

14:32.301 --> 14:38.137
what was the first car ever to be laid out
in a way that we accept as being normal now.

14:38.207 --> 14:39.697
- Good. Moving on...
- No, no, no.

14:39.775 --> 14:42.642
It's a very good question
that's never been asked.

14:42.712 --> 14:45.010
We have the steering wheel in front of you,

14:45.081 --> 14:48.346
the clutch on the left, the brake in the middle,
the throttle pedal on the right.

14:48.417 --> 14:50.578
You've got the gearstick there
and the handbrake there,

14:50.653 --> 14:53.451
but what was the first car to be like that?

14:53.522 --> 14:57.458
No, no, James and I decided - good idea -
to go down to the Beaulieu Motor Museum,

14:57.526 --> 15:02.225
and see if we could find the answer
to a question that no one is asking.

15:02.298 --> 15:05.062
- Because no one cares.
- (Laughter)

15:05.134 --> 15:08.626
(James) This is the very first car ever made.

15:08.704 --> 15:12.640
The Benz Patent Motorwagen from 1896.

15:12.708 --> 15:15.541
This is Genesis.

15:21.283 --> 15:25.447
And it's absolutely nothing like
the cars we know today.

15:25.521 --> 15:27.989
For a start,
it has this tiller steering arrangement,

15:28.057 --> 15:30.753
which is exactly the sort of thing
you'd find on a canal boat.

15:30.826 --> 15:33.522
And it also only has a single front wheel,

15:33.596 --> 15:37.430
so presumably, if you were a bit too vigorous
with this, the whole thing could topple over.

15:38.601 --> 15:40.626
Performance? Not great.

15:40.703 --> 15:45.470
It has a one-cylinder, one-liter engine,
which gives a top speed of nine.

15:45.541 --> 15:50.035
And with a 1.5- Liter fuel tank,
its range is only five miles.

15:51.480 --> 15:54.347
Tricky when the petrol station
hadn't been invented.

15:54.417 --> 15:59.354
But it did show the world that personal
motorized transportation was possible.

16:03.592 --> 16:07.221
(Jeremy) Three years later,
the British came up with this.

16:07.296 --> 16:09.264
The Royal Enfield.

16:09.331 --> 16:11.299
That's not the brake!

16:12.368 --> 16:14.199
No!

16:14.270 --> 16:16.397
Its controls were hideously complicated.

16:16.472 --> 16:19.566
But there were some good points.

16:19.642 --> 16:23.840
This had twice the power of the Benz.

16:23.913 --> 16:25.642
Two horsepower.

16:25.714 --> 16:29.480
But most important of all, it had four wheels,

16:29.552 --> 16:33.750
so what they accidentally designed here
is the quad bike.

16:35.658 --> 16:39.617
One of the biggest problems with these early
cars is getting them going in the first place.

16:39.695 --> 16:42.994
The starter motor hasn't been invented yet,
there's no ignition key.

16:43.065 --> 16:46.034
You have to use the starting handle.

16:46.101 --> 16:49.559
And the great thing about this particular car,
the De Dion-Bouton,

16:49.638 --> 16:53.074
is that when you turn the handle,
it will break your wrist.

16:53.142 --> 16:56.305
- You what?
- Seven members of staff at the museum

16:56.378 --> 16:58.869
have had their wrists broken by this very car.

16:59.615 --> 17:02.482
We don't actually need to drive it.
We can just talk about it.

17:02.551 --> 17:06.214
This is one of the first cars that sold in great
numbers. We have to know what it was like.

17:06.288 --> 17:09.382
- You're going to have to get it going.
- Urgh!

17:11.727 --> 17:14.388
(Jeremy) Having got it started,
we needed to get it moving,

17:14.463 --> 17:17.022
and for that we had a copy
of the original handbook,

17:17.098 --> 17:21.968
which had been translated from French,
'cause the car was made in France, into English.

17:22.037 --> 17:24.028
Literally.

17:24.106 --> 17:27.337
"For making the carriage walking
at the first speed,

17:27.409 --> 17:31.675
"take back the drag of the wheel
backward crowbar of the right,

17:31.747 --> 17:37.549
"and take completely and progressively
the crowbar of embrayage to you, while you..."

17:39.021 --> 17:42.149
"Hurl the mover till his starting."

17:44.026 --> 17:45.960
(Both) Argh! Aha!

17:47.429 --> 17:52.264
I can understand why this is better
than going around looking at a horse's bottom,

17:52.334 --> 17:56.634
but how did anyone
ever figure out how it worked?

17:56.705 --> 18:02.166
If we've established that that's the gear lever,
and that's the advance thing, the ignition,

18:02.244 --> 18:04.508
and that's something important,

18:04.580 --> 18:08.983
this was designed for someone
with three arms and one leg.

18:09.051 --> 18:11.542
- It was.
- But if you need to do a hill start,

18:11.620 --> 18:13.451
you have to steer it with your chest.

18:13.522 --> 18:16.958
Or your face. It would be difficult.

18:17.026 --> 18:18.653
How do I get it into top gear?

18:18.727 --> 18:24.825
"For taking the second speed, push rapidly
at the crowbar forward without brutality.

18:24.900 --> 18:29.667
"When it is raised up again
it gains all its strength."

18:31.307 --> 18:32.934
(Crunch, squeak)

18:33.008 --> 18:36.409
- Yes!
- Yeah! Top gear!

18:36.478 --> 18:38.742
- Now, how do I stop?
- What?

18:38.814 --> 18:40.748
Well, I'm going to have to stop eventually.

18:40.816 --> 18:42.579
This road won't go on for ever.

18:46.188 --> 18:48.748
- "Hurl the movements..." No.
- Seriously...

18:48.824 --> 18:50.792
- I don't know, James.
- It's quite important. Find it.

18:50.859 --> 18:53.623
- You're in charge of the instructions.
- They're in gibberish!

18:53.696 --> 18:58.133
There's no point in relying on this.
I brought them as a joke for the viewer.

18:58.200 --> 19:01.192
(James) Oh, God, there's a...

19:01.270 --> 19:03.864
"For making the carriage completely stopped,

19:03.939 --> 19:09.536
"when it goes at 15 kilometers an hour,
take abruptly the crowbar of embrayage..."

19:09.612 --> 19:11.876
- Right.
- No, no, wait, we haven't finished.

19:11.947 --> 19:14.677
- You haven't got long. Come on.
- "When you are in first speed,

19:14.750 --> 19:18.186
"push..." We aren't, are we?
James, we're going to be killed!

19:18.253 --> 19:19.811
(Klaxon blares)

19:19.888 --> 19:22.186
I decided to use ingenuity.

19:22.257 --> 19:26.591
- (Jeremy) I'm using friction.
- That's neutral. I've got neutral.

19:26.662 --> 19:29.961
- It's my wind resistance. Stop it!
- I don't know how to do it.

19:30.032 --> 19:32.091
- Make it stop!
- I don't...

19:34.737 --> 19:36.796
(James) Right.

19:36.872 --> 19:38.100
(Jeremy) Ohh!

19:38.907 --> 19:42.343
(Jeremy) So, France hadn't got it right,
and nor had America.

19:43.479 --> 19:47.006
This is the Stevens Derailleur,
which has eight clutches,

19:47.082 --> 19:50.711
and what kind of dullard would think
that that was brilliant?

19:50.786 --> 19:52.549
(James) That's brilliant.
(Jeremy) What's brilliant?

19:52.621 --> 19:56.387
This gearbox.
This is a three-speed constant mesh.

19:56.458 --> 20:00.451
So those are constant mesh gears
and it has selector forks.

20:00.529 --> 20:02.463
But it doesn't have dog clutches.

20:02.531 --> 20:05.432
So that's like the brake band
on an automatic gearbox, in fact.

20:05.501 --> 20:08.163
In a modern gearbox,
one would always be loose on its shaft,

20:08.237 --> 20:10.102
either the input shaft or the lay shaft.

20:10.172 --> 20:12.766
That's 1903, and that is basically what...

20:14.777 --> 20:17.940
You might imagine that the first car
to get everything in the right order

20:18.013 --> 20:22.882
was the first car ever to be mass-produced,
the Model T Ford.

20:22.951 --> 20:26.284
By the time it went out of production in 1927,

20:26.355 --> 20:29.381
half the cars in the world were Model Ts.

20:29.458 --> 20:32.450
So you'd imagine that all the cars
that came along afterwards

20:32.528 --> 20:34.894
would be laid out in the same way.

20:34.963 --> 20:37.227
Luckily they weren't.

20:38.534 --> 20:40.832
Honestly, I'm glad this didn't catch on,

20:40.903 --> 20:47.172
because driving a Model T
is more complicated that doing eye surgery.

20:47.242 --> 20:51.679
It's almost as though Henry Ford
was being, I don't know, deliberately obtuse,

20:51.747 --> 20:56.411
because to make it move,
you have to up the revs with the accelerator,

20:56.485 --> 20:58.646
which is here, on the steering wheel.

20:58.721 --> 21:01.554
Then you move the handbrake to the middle,

21:01.623 --> 21:04.114
which somehow puts the car in neutral,

21:04.193 --> 21:06.093
and then depress the left pedal.

21:06.161 --> 21:08.459
Yeah!

21:11.800 --> 21:17.466
The only problem is, to maintain this speed
I have to keep my foot pressed hard down

21:17.539 --> 21:21.373
on what feels like
a very, very heavy clutch pedal.

21:21.443 --> 21:24.970
And the pain in my thigh is excruciating.

21:25.047 --> 21:29.507
The only way round this
is to change into top gear.

21:29.585 --> 21:31.576
Now, to do that we have to go faster,

21:31.653 --> 21:35.214
push this lever, the handbrake
that isn't a handbrake, all the way down,

21:35.290 --> 21:39.090
and then I can take my foot off that pedal.

21:39.161 --> 21:43.393
Now the speed shoots up,
whether you like it or not, to about forty.

21:43.465 --> 21:48.027
And forty, on wooden wheels in a world
with hardly any roads, is terrifying.

21:48.937 --> 21:50.996
(Screams)

21:51.073 --> 21:53.974
(James) Jeremy and I
were beginning to believe we'd never find

21:54.042 --> 21:57.739
the first car with what we'd now call
conventional controls.

21:57.813 --> 22:00.077
But then we stumbled on this...

22:02.184 --> 22:06.416
...the Cadillac Type 53, from 1916.

22:06.488 --> 22:10.117
Look! A handbrake and a gear lever
in the middle of the car,

22:10.192 --> 22:12.456
and three pedals in the right order.

22:12.528 --> 22:16.692
And better still, no starting handle,
no broken wrists.

22:16.765 --> 22:20.223
This was the first car to come with one of these.

22:24.173 --> 22:29.042
This may look as old-fashioned as all the other
nonsense from the early days of motoring,

22:29.111 --> 22:34.048
but what we have here is the nub,
the first properly modern car.

22:35.417 --> 22:39.786
The thing is, that nobody knew
when this came along

22:39.855 --> 22:46.693
that they had actually hit on what would become
the template for all cars in the future.

22:46.762 --> 22:50.698
(James) Exactly. This bright idea could easily
have been snuffed out by the next bright idea.

22:50.766 --> 22:53.667
(Jeremy) No. But what made
this bright idea stick

22:53.735 --> 22:57.569
what that a British chap called Herbert Austin,
who I'm sure you know, came along,

22:57.639 --> 23:02.872
copied all the ideas and put them on
his car for the people, which was, of course...

23:03.846 --> 23:06.246
- The Seven.
- The Seven. Exactly.

23:11.987 --> 23:15.218
This car cost just L125,

23:15.290 --> 23:17.781
four times less than the Cadillac.

23:17.860 --> 23:21.091
What's more, it was built under license
by BMW in Germany,

23:21.163 --> 23:23.996
and copied too by Datsun in Japan.

23:26.869 --> 23:30.703
This car, then, the little Austin Seven,

23:30.772 --> 23:35.903
took Cadillac's bright idea,
showed it to the world and made it stick.

23:45.721 --> 23:49.953
Ladies and gentlemen,
Chris Goffey and Tony Mason there.

23:50.025 --> 23:55.361
No, no, thanks. Really, thanks, lads,
for wasting nine minutes of my life.

23:55.430 --> 24:00.094
- I'll tell you something else really interesting.
- Not with a knife sticking through your neck.

24:00.168 --> 24:04.434
- No, seriously. During the war...
- Oh, God, no, not James May on the war!

24:05.207 --> 24:08.472
Please! Isn't it time you put
a star in our reasonably priced car?

24:08.543 --> 24:10.340
It is time we put a star
in the reasonably priced car.

24:10.412 --> 24:14.075
My guest tonight once sang
about a semi by the sea,

24:14.149 --> 24:17.209
and funnily enough,
James May once had a similar experience

24:17.286 --> 24:19.413
but when a dreadnought sailed by.

24:20.222 --> 24:22.349
Anyway, ladies and gentlemen,

24:22.424 --> 24:24.722
James Blunt!

24:25.661 --> 24:29.688
- Yes! How are you?
- I'm very well.

24:29.765 --> 24:33.223
So you've taken two years to get here.
Have a seat.

24:34.269 --> 24:36.635
Excellent.

24:39.141 --> 24:41.439
I'm honored that you should come down,
and thank you for that.

24:41.510 --> 24:43.774
- Thanks. It's been a nice day out.
- Good.

24:43.845 --> 24:47.281
Good, because you're the first guest
we've ever had who can drive a tank.

24:47.349 --> 24:50.944
Yeah. I think you'll see in a minute
that I can't drive a car, though.

24:51.019 --> 24:54.716
Yes, but you see, your problem is
that your car history's rubbish.

24:54.790 --> 24:59.284
I mean, we have sometimes had guests on
who have just had appalling car histories,

24:59.361 --> 25:01.556
but yours... You've only owned, is it one car?

25:01.630 --> 25:06.897
I have, I'm afraid to say on this program
of all programs, owned a Lada Riva.

25:06.969 --> 25:09.028
(Laughter)

25:09.104 --> 25:12.631
I haven't finished, actually.
It was a Lada Riva SL 1300.

25:12.708 --> 25:14.733
SL's for Slightly Luxurious.

25:16.178 --> 25:18.544
It was racing red, or Ferrari red,
whichever you choose.

25:18.613 --> 25:21.173
- They weren't bad cars, those Lada Rivas.
- Yeah.

25:21.249 --> 25:25.083
Actually, it did have bucket seats,
and I installed an enormous great stereo in it,

25:25.153 --> 25:26.814
which, sadly, was nicked one day.

25:26.888 --> 25:31.825
I think it's actually even more embarrassing
than owning a Lada to nick the stereo from it.

25:31.893 --> 25:35.693
Why have you never replaced it with another
car? Presumably you can afford one now.

25:35.764 --> 25:38.324
- Because I owned a motorbike after that.
- Oh, did you?

25:38.400 --> 25:40.994
- Yeah, a Moto Guzzi...
- I didn't know you were homosexual.

25:41.069 --> 25:45.062
Yes, absolutely.
Most of my songs are about you.

25:50.212 --> 25:52.203
Oh, God, no.

25:55.650 --> 25:58.847
I've got all kinds of lyrics
going through my head now.

25:58.920 --> 26:00.751
Which bit of the army were you in?

26:00.822 --> 26:02.983
The Lifeguards,
part of the Household Cavalry,

26:03.058 --> 26:06.186
so reconnaissance,
and that's why we had very small tanks.

26:06.261 --> 26:08.661
- Were they like diet tanks?
- Yeah, a Scimitar.

26:08.730 --> 26:11.221
A main battle tank's about 77 tons,

26:11.299 --> 26:13.267
and mine was about four tons.

26:13.335 --> 26:15.860
Did you see in the paper on Wednesday

26:15.937 --> 26:20.840
the EU is saying there's got to be
emissions legislation for military vehicles?

26:20.909 --> 26:23.673
- Did you see that?
- I have heard about this, yeah.

26:23.745 --> 26:26.009
We're going green in the army.

26:26.081 --> 26:28.379
How can you worry about the pipe at the back

26:28.450 --> 26:32.853
when the pipe at the front, there's
depleted uranium coming out of that one.

26:32.921 --> 26:34.980
"Yeah, I know, but look..."

26:35.057 --> 26:38.185
- We're just trying to make war a bit safer.
- (Laughs) Yes.

26:39.294 --> 26:42.661
It's a good job you aren't in the army now,
I have to say that.

26:42.731 --> 26:45.894
Yeah, it's a pretty miserable time, I think,
to be in the army.

26:45.967 --> 26:50.666
They're working incredibly hard, doing a really
tough job and not under great circumstances.

26:50.739 --> 26:56.541
You know the covenant that's supposed to exist
between us and them? They all say it's gone.

26:56.611 --> 27:02.072
I was talking to one the other day, a chap
called Mark who's had his leg blown off in Iraq,

27:02.150 --> 27:04.618
and he came back
and all we gave him was MRSA.

27:04.686 --> 27:07.985
- Yeah.
- And I don't think that's really fair.

27:08.056 --> 27:10.650
- I know you're a patron for Help For Heroes.
- You are, too.

27:10.725 --> 27:16.391
I do the same thing, because there aren't many
funds for the army, particularly for equipment,

27:16.465 --> 27:19.992
but more so, even more important, for those
who get injured, when they come back.

27:20.068 --> 27:25.005
Now, you were in the army skiing team,
cavalry skiing team?

27:25.073 --> 27:30.306
Yes, they sent me skiing for about three months
every single year. It's not all fun, fun, fun!

27:31.179 --> 27:34.876
No, it's hard work.
Didn't they name a chairlift after you?

27:34.950 --> 27:38.147
- I had a chairlift named after me, yeah.
- Because you spent so much time...

27:38.220 --> 27:40.188
I had to crack a bottle of champagne
on it and say,

27:40.255 --> 27:43.816
"I name this chairlift James Blunt.
God bless her and all who ride me."

27:45.861 --> 27:48.796
But you did actually have to go to Kosovo,
didn't you? It wasn't all...

27:48.864 --> 27:54.097
Yeah, in '99, during the war there, the bombing
campaign and the peacekeeping afterwards.

27:54.169 --> 27:57.332
- Was it very horrible?
- Yeah, war's a pretty miserable place.

27:57.405 --> 28:01.398
So was the Kosovan Albanians and the Serbs
murdering each other.

28:01.543 --> 28:03.340
'Cause you were... Weren't you the first in?

28:03.411 --> 28:07.108
Across the border, yeah, and the first one
to Pristina with my troop of soldiers.

28:07.182 --> 28:09.707
Really? The very first one in?
That's quite something.

28:09.784 --> 28:13.049
- And you had your guitar on your tank.
- Strapped to the outside.

28:13.121 --> 28:15.282
It was a precious guitar,
I wanted it inside,

28:15.357 --> 28:19.225
but I was told by my superiors
I had to keep the soldiers on the inside.

28:19.294 --> 28:22.286
I wasn't allowed to strap them on the outside.

28:22.931 --> 28:25.263
And you just made sweet music in there.

28:25.333 --> 28:29.861
Do you inhale helium before you sing,
or is that just how it... (squeaky)... comes out?

28:29.938 --> 28:32.930
- I was fed it as a child.
- Fed helium?

28:33.008 --> 28:38.378
I think if I sang and inhaled helium, it would be
beyond the human ear's register, wouldn't it?

28:38.446 --> 28:41.813
- Only dogs would hear it.
- Argh, no, make him stop!

28:41.883 --> 28:45.717
You do actually take the mick
out of your own songs at gigs, don't you?

28:45.787 --> 28:47.414
Well, have you heard them?

28:49.925 --> 28:52.689
Now, let's just get this. I'm confused by this.

28:52.761 --> 28:55.594
Genuinely, OK?
Your first album sold, what, twelve million?

28:55.664 --> 28:59.623
Something like that, although my mother bought
about a million, so I did have a helping hand.

28:59.701 --> 29:02.261
- And I've got a million.
- We have a warehouse about the size of this,

29:02.337 --> 29:03.770
full of my albums.

29:03.838 --> 29:07.831
And then the new one, All The Lost Souls,
that's flying out, isn't it?

29:07.909 --> 29:12.073
So why are you voted number four in the list
of the hundred most irritating things in Britain?

29:12.147 --> 29:14.172
That really pisses me off, actually.

29:15.283 --> 29:18.741
- I thought I'd at least do better than that.
- (Laughter)

29:18.820 --> 29:22.449
You did beat traffic wardens
and you beat men in flip-flops.

29:22.524 --> 29:24.355
Well, I tell you, next year!

29:24.426 --> 29:28.362
- I'm going for the number one or two spot.
- Climb it up.

29:28.430 --> 29:31.524
You have packed a lot into your life.
Obviously, there's the army stuff.

29:31.600 --> 29:34.797
You had a pilot license at 16. Do you still fly?

29:34.869 --> 29:39.670
I'm normally just in the back. If you ever find
yourself in a plane with me, you should jump.

29:39.741 --> 29:42.107
Why did you go and learn to fly?

29:42.177 --> 29:44.338
My dad was a helicopter pilot
in the Army Air Corps.

29:44.412 --> 29:48.906
- What did he fly, Lynxes?
- Yeah, Lynx, and Gazelle Scout before that.

29:48.984 --> 29:50.611
Which they're still flying now, out in Iraq.

29:50.685 --> 29:53.984
Exactly. In fact, my brother-in-law,
who's here tonight, has got a Scout.

29:54.055 --> 29:55.545
He's got one or he flies one?

29:55.624 --> 29:59.185
He's got a Scout. He flies one
and he's got one. I found him on eBay.

29:59.261 --> 30:01.525
What, you found your brother-in-law on eBay?

30:01.596 --> 30:03.791
Or the Scout on eBay?

30:03.865 --> 30:06.800
No, what happened was, I found my sister
who, again, is here tonight,

30:06.868 --> 30:10.133
crying in her flat because she couldn't
get to a funeral in southern Ireland.

30:10.205 --> 30:13.265
The planes were on strike
and the ferries were out of season.

30:13.341 --> 30:17.675
Obviously, no trains to Cork in southern Ireland,
so I put my sister on eBay

30:17.746 --> 30:21.910
as "A damsel in distress needs a knight
in shining armor. What can you do?"

30:21.983 --> 30:27.250
- And this fool started bidding, amongst others.
- You put your sister on eBay?

30:27.322 --> 30:31.622
Yeah. And anyway, he bid and bid
amongst others and he won.

30:31.693 --> 30:34.127
He had a helicopter, a Scout,
so he could fly her to the funeral,

30:34.195 --> 30:36.425
and some six months ago, they got married.

30:36.498 --> 30:38.591
- No way!
- Yeah.

30:38.667 --> 30:40.794
You put your sister on eBay
and now she's married?

30:40.869 --> 30:44.270
And I have a second sister
who'll be online shortly.

30:45.340 --> 30:46.705
Starting price L5.

30:46.775 --> 30:49.573
This is what they do in Thailand, isn't it?

30:50.545 --> 30:54.743
That's fantastic. And then
slightly portly men in Barnsley buy them.

30:54.816 --> 30:57.148
Yes. Er, you must have met him.

30:59.521 --> 31:02.786
Right, now, come on. Your lap, how was it?

31:02.857 --> 31:06.258
It was great fun.
I don't think I damaged the car too much.

31:06.328 --> 31:08.455
- Were you frightened?
- No, I really enjoyed it.

31:08.530 --> 31:10.828
You like speed,
bearing in mind the bikes and skiing.

31:10.899 --> 31:13.959
No, I really enjoy going fast,
and it was a great fun day.

31:14.035 --> 31:16.128
I really had fun. Stig is great.

31:16.204 --> 31:18.729
OK, now, who'd like to see the lap?

31:18.807 --> 31:20.536
- (All) Yes.
- OK, let's play the tape.

31:20.608 --> 31:22.838
(Tires squeal)

31:22.911 --> 31:26.005
(Jeremy) Good bit of axel tramp,
or whatever it is in a front-wheel drive car.

31:26.081 --> 31:28.106
Come on, you little (bleep)!

31:29.150 --> 31:30.549
(Jeremy) Enthusiasticl

31:30.618 --> 31:33.246
Up to the one hundreds.
Here's the yellow marker.

31:33.722 --> 31:36.885
What yellow marker? You're seeing things.

31:36.958 --> 31:39.256
That's good. That's very good, very neat.

31:40.462 --> 31:42.191
And very neat again.

31:43.965 --> 31:46.126
0oh, looking worried. Are you worried?

31:47.068 --> 31:48.501
He's very worriedl

31:50.105 --> 31:51.402
Are you all right in there?

31:53.208 --> 31:55.574
0h, my Godl

31:56.911 --> 31:58.640
It's absolutely terrifying.

31:58.713 --> 32:00.681
Did you look like that in the tank?

32:02.550 --> 32:04.677
No wonder you were first in.
Now, here we go now.

32:04.753 --> 32:08.189
At the 50, no surrender!

32:08.256 --> 32:10.224
(Splutters) Right.

32:11.226 --> 32:13.421
Good, that's very nice.

32:13.495 --> 32:15.554
There's a huge great jet over there.

32:15.630 --> 32:19.225
No, concentrate on the track, man,
not the scenery. Now, here we go.

32:19.300 --> 32:20.961
That was very quick through there.

32:21.035 --> 32:24.835
Second to last corner. Are we going to get
round that properly? Yes, cutting it nicely.

32:24.906 --> 32:27.067
Into Gambon. Here we go.

32:27.142 --> 32:30.236
Wowl Nicely held. Very good.

32:30.311 --> 32:33.109
And there we are, across the line.

32:33.848 --> 32:35.475
Yeah.

32:40.455 --> 32:44.551
Here are the peeps
who've been round so far in the Lacetti.

32:44.626 --> 32:50.064
Any idea where you think you might have come,
bearing in mind it was jolly wet out there?

32:50.131 --> 32:53.692
The only wet ones we've had,
which are the ones to matter, are Jamie Oliver,

32:53.768 --> 32:56.134
and Philip Glennister did a wet one.

32:56.204 --> 33:00.573
- Well, yeah, close to Jamie, if I'm lucky.
- OK, well, there you are.

33:00.642 --> 33:04.169
So you did it in one minute...

33:06.481 --> 33:11.919
...48.3 seconds.

33:11.986 --> 33:15.786
Ladies and gentlemen, a quick time for...
I'll put a wet on it.

33:15.857 --> 33:20.590
A wet. There he is, 48.3 there.

33:22.831 --> 33:25.629
So, are you pleased with that?
You should be, 'cause that's a wet lap.

33:25.700 --> 33:27.998
Yeah, just above Billie Piper.

33:28.069 --> 33:29.832
Who wouldn't want to be there?

33:31.105 --> 33:33.096
- It's been an absolute pleasure having you.
- Thank you.

33:33.174 --> 33:36.109
I do like Back To Bedlam, and I like
the new album, so thanks very much.

33:36.177 --> 33:38.668
- Ladies and gentlemen, James Blunt.
- Thank you.

33:38.746 --> 33:41.078
Thanks, James Blunt. That was a good time.

33:44.686 --> 33:50.625
Now, it's fair to say that I'm not exactly
a Formula One motor racing fan.

33:50.692 --> 33:53.786
I was sitting in the office the other day,
wondering why they're paid so much

33:53.862 --> 33:56.626
just for sitting down behind a steering wheel.

33:56.698 --> 34:00.065
I may even have said out loud,
"How hard can it be?"

34:00.134 --> 34:04.594
So someone decided it might be a good idea
for me to go and find out.

34:10.612 --> 34:13.547
This is the Renault R25.

34:13.614 --> 34:17.710
As the car that won Fernando Alonso
a World Championship,

34:18.887 --> 34:22.219
it's one of the all-time F1 greats.

34:23.190 --> 34:28.185
The R25 is also the last of the breed
from the monstrous V10 era,

34:28.263 --> 34:31.994
when the cars were chucking out
close to a thousand horsepower.

34:34.068 --> 34:36.036
There's going to be
no Top Gear nonsense today.

34:36.103 --> 34:39.335
I'm not going to race it against a cheetah
or a bat on a superbike.

34:39.407 --> 34:44.242
My mission is simply to get that round a track.

34:44.978 --> 34:49.143
Specifically, two laps around Stowe Circuit
at Silverstone.

34:49.217 --> 34:56.123
More specifically, two laps without stuffing
a priceless world-championship-winning F1 car.

34:57.191 --> 34:59.716
Now, to put all this into context,

34:59.794 --> 35:03.787
the fastest road car I've ever driven
is the Bugatti Veyron,

35:03.865 --> 35:08.802
which has a power-to-weight ratio
of 530 horsepower per ton.

35:10.104 --> 35:13.073
But the power-to-weight ratio of this

35:13.141 --> 35:17.441
is 1,500 horsepower per ton.

35:17.512 --> 35:19.480
But it's not just the numbers.

35:19.547 --> 35:24.814
Nothing can prepare your mind, your senses,
your body, your reaction times

35:24.886 --> 35:27.912
for the assault of a Formula One car.

35:30.158 --> 35:33.218
So, before the assault, it was back to school.

35:33.294 --> 35:36.422
My teacher would be race team boss
Jonathan Lewis,

35:36.497 --> 35:41.059
and my first lesson would be
in one of his little Formula Renault cars.

35:41.135 --> 35:44.764
- It's very simple, really.
- It looks like a Formula One car to me.

35:44.839 --> 35:47.137
Only a bit smaller and not quite as fiddly.

35:47.208 --> 35:50.644
OK, well, it is. It is a baby Formula car.

35:51.212 --> 35:55.342
As a Veyron veteran,
I was keen to show him what I could do.

35:55.416 --> 35:57.384
(Engine roars and cuts out)

35:57.452 --> 35:58.419
(Laughs)

35:58.486 --> 36:01.080
(Revs and stalls)

36:01.155 --> 36:02.554
(Bleep)

36:03.424 --> 36:08.020
Still, the Formula Renault only has
a piddly two-liter engine from a Clio,

36:08.096 --> 36:10.860
so mastering it should be easy.

36:11.766 --> 36:14.667
Right, I'm going to try and gas it a bit
down the straight.

36:17.972 --> 36:19.439
Argh!

36:20.575 --> 36:21.837
Gah!

36:24.746 --> 36:27.874
I've never let a complete novice
go out in one of our cars before.

36:30.952 --> 36:35.218
The Formula Renault
has only one fifth the power of a F1 car,

36:35.289 --> 36:39.589
and I now realized the size of the mountain
I had to climb.

36:40.728 --> 36:44.562
First time I've ever experienced
what proper brakes are.

36:44.632 --> 36:46.566
It just hits a wall!

36:47.335 --> 36:50.065
And just as I was getting used to this car,

36:50.138 --> 36:52.129
I was shoved into its bigger brother,

36:53.107 --> 36:57.271
a World Series car
with twice the power of the Formula Renault.

36:57.345 --> 36:59.677
Mother of God!

36:59.747 --> 37:01.510
(Engine howls)

37:01.582 --> 37:03.516
He's gone quiet.

37:03.584 --> 37:07.452
And no wonder.
The straight-line speed I could cope with,

37:07.522 --> 37:11.185
but in the corners
I just couldn't think fast enough to react.

37:11.259 --> 37:13.989
So quick!
Come on, Hammond, just trust it.

37:19.100 --> 37:21.432
(Groans)

37:21.502 --> 37:25.268
It's just so... There's so much to learn.

37:25.339 --> 37:29.332
I can't drive fast enough to get the heat
in the brakes, and then there's no brakes.

37:29.410 --> 37:33.779
I've just grappled with 500 brake horsepower
in a 500-kilo car, and I'm halfway there.

37:34.348 --> 37:38.114
I was summoned to look at the readouts
from my on-board telemetry.

37:38.186 --> 37:42.054
You're riding the brake, and
you're riding the accelerator, believe it or not.

37:42.123 --> 37:43.647
'Cause I'm doing left-foot braking.

37:43.725 --> 37:48.594
And you've been quite severe on one of the
down-shifts, and you've put 8.5 on the motor.

37:48.663 --> 37:54.727
If I'd done what I did on that lap in
a Formula One car, what would have happened?

37:54.802 --> 37:57.168
You'd have probably spun it
and wrecked the engine.

37:57.238 --> 38:00.207
What's an engine rebuild on a Formula One car?

38:00.274 --> 38:03.675
Probably about 150, 200,000. More.

38:07.115 --> 38:09.913
I needed lots more time in the World Series car.

38:09.984 --> 38:12.350
But that wasn't going to happen...

38:12.420 --> 38:14.388
(Bleep, bleep, bleep)

38:14.455 --> 38:18.755
...because my muscles were struggling to cope
with the cornering forces.

38:18.826 --> 38:22.819
My head is going to come off,
and I'm not joking.

38:23.564 --> 38:27.125
His neck'll go soon,
so he needs to drive the Formula One.

38:28.936 --> 38:32.099
Before I moved on, Yoda gave me a pep talk.

38:33.775 --> 38:35.868
Everything you experienced
in the World Series car

38:35.943 --> 38:41.438
is probably going to be more than three times
as much, maybe more, in the Formula One.

38:41.516 --> 38:45.145
(Richard) My thinking time,
that was my problem.

38:45.219 --> 38:49.053
You know, I had a bit of an off. It's because
I thought I'd left it too late to brake.

38:49.123 --> 38:51.614
Then I realized I hadn't,
but because I was thinking that,

38:51.692 --> 38:54.559
the car was already round the corner
and I was in the wrong gear and I span.

38:54.629 --> 38:57.530
I can't think fast enough,
more than anything else.

38:57.598 --> 39:01.295
You're going to have to really concentrate,
Richard, especially with that thing.

39:01.369 --> 39:04.805
If you think that's hard,
that's going to be another level.

39:06.274 --> 39:08.674
My fear wasn't just about the speed.

39:08.743 --> 39:12.042
It was about
what I was going to be entrusted with.

39:12.113 --> 39:16.482
The more time you spend with one of these
things, the more otherworldly it becomes.

39:16.551 --> 39:19.042
Let's talk about the money,
'cause we can all understand that.

39:19.120 --> 39:21.987
The engine, L170,000.

39:22.056 --> 39:26.356
The gearbox casing, with no gears in it,
L60,000.

39:26.427 --> 39:28.759
The wing, L20,000.

39:28.830 --> 39:30.297
But those are all the big bits.

39:30.364 --> 39:33.800
It's still off this planet when you get to
the little bits you've got on your car at home.

39:33.868 --> 39:37.770
So the wheel nut, there it is. 500 quid.

39:37.839 --> 39:40.865
And then for the socket to remove it, L1,000.

39:40.942 --> 39:45.242
And look, the mirror. It's just that little thing.
800 quid.

39:45.313 --> 39:49.340
And the steering wheel, L30,000.

39:49.417 --> 39:51.851
And it isn't just the money, either.

39:51.919 --> 39:58.017
This thing is not just expensive,
it's quite incredibly fragile and highly strung.

39:58.092 --> 40:04.429
So the engine, the tolerances in here are so fine
that when it's cold it's effectively seized solid.

40:04.498 --> 40:06.989
You can't start it cold. It has to be heated up.

40:07.068 --> 40:11.232
They do that by constantly pumping warm water
round it when it's in the pits, at 80 degrees.

40:11.305 --> 40:15.071
You can't put cold oil in, either.
It has to be warm and fed intravenously.

40:15.142 --> 40:18.839
It's like it's on a life-support machine.

40:24.118 --> 40:25.881
That's snug.

40:26.654 --> 40:31.216
If you're ten, I'm doing this on your behalf.
You're in here with me.

40:32.894 --> 40:35.761
- So now I've got control of the throttle.
- (Engine roars)

40:35.830 --> 40:39.561
That's me. Dear God,
that's me revving a Formula One engine.

40:43.204 --> 40:46.264
The eyes of the whole F1 team were upon me.

40:46.340 --> 40:48.308
This was it.

40:48.376 --> 40:51.311
(Engine howls unevenly)

40:57.485 --> 40:58.975
Revs.

41:09.096 --> 41:12.224
It had taken me a minute to do 40 feet.

41:13.601 --> 41:15.466
(Engine off)

41:15.536 --> 41:18.869
Why are we going?
Are we going all the way back in? Is it all off?

41:18.940 --> 41:23.673
Here's the problem with this stalling.
I know it's very funny, but the car has a system.

41:23.744 --> 41:25.268
If you stall in F1 it's a disaster,

41:25.346 --> 41:29.840
so as you're setting off, if it thinks you haven't
got enough power it cuts the clutch in again,

41:29.917 --> 41:32.010
and you just look an idiot.

41:32.086 --> 41:34.452
- Eight.
- Eight anti-stalls?

41:34.522 --> 41:36.513
That's a record, then, innit?

41:37.925 --> 41:42.453
After the team had laughed at me and warmed
the tires to make them more grippy,

41:42.530 --> 41:44.498
they sent me on my way.

41:47.134 --> 41:52.595
Oh, God. It feels totally different
to the other car. Totally different.

41:52.673 --> 41:55.699
Turning left.
My God, I'm in a Formula One car.

41:55.776 --> 41:57.744
I'm going to try the throttle and see...

41:57.812 --> 42:01.248
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

42:02.183 --> 42:04.378
Holy Mother!

42:04.452 --> 42:07.319
There's no temperature in the brakes.

42:11.058 --> 42:15.825
In the half a lap I'd managed,
the car had made a big impression.

42:16.530 --> 42:21.797
It's absolutely
the most glorious machine in the world.

42:22.770 --> 42:24.533
(Man) Wait till you get into second.

42:24.605 --> 42:29.235
I'm going as fast as I feel I can, and
it's not fast enough to keep heating the tires,

42:29.310 --> 42:31.710
which means I've got no grip,
let alone no downforce.

42:31.779 --> 42:36.409
If I go a bit faster than that, that means there'll
still be no heat in the tires and no downforce,

42:36.484 --> 42:38.679
and I'm going even faster and I will crash.

42:38.753 --> 42:41.551
The only way from where I am now
is a lot faster.

42:41.622 --> 42:45.080
Then I'll have heat in the tires and grip,
and I won't crash.

42:48.129 --> 42:53.089
And to make things worse, the man
with my telemetry was hardly a bag of laughs.

42:53.167 --> 42:56.068
There's a big gap between
when you're lifting off and braking.

42:56.137 --> 43:00.437
You should be coming straight off the
accelerator and going straight onto the brakes.

43:00.508 --> 43:02.100
There's no need to have that big gap.

43:02.176 --> 43:04.804
When you say a big gap, how big a gap is it?

43:04.879 --> 43:08.076
- Half a second, between you lifting off...
- It's not massive, is it?

43:08.149 --> 43:10.117
...before you go on the brakes.
It should be straight away.

43:12.053 --> 43:17.719
He was right, though. If I was going to do
two laps in this thing, I had to dig deep.

43:18.626 --> 43:21.652
I've got to think
about everything I've learned.

43:23.831 --> 43:26.527
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!

43:26.600 --> 43:28.864
That's unbelievable.

43:30.971 --> 43:34.372
There's so much.
It's... It's just going mental!

43:35.709 --> 43:38.576
There's no temperature in the brakes,
they feel like they're not working.

43:38.646 --> 43:40.580
Oh, this is... like a dream.

43:48.789 --> 43:50.950
I'd done a lap. Just one more.

43:57.565 --> 44:00.830
Turning in. Oh, it's beautiful!

44:01.802 --> 44:04.737
I suspect the chief mechanic had seen better,

44:04.805 --> 44:07.672
but as far as I was concerned, driving Godl

44:07.741 --> 44:11.802
And the most scary thing in the whole world!

44:11.879 --> 44:13.938
The last corner is coming up!

44:14.014 --> 44:17.142
I'm braking. We're turning left, I'm in second.

44:17.218 --> 44:18.981
I'm going to nail it to the line.

44:19.053 --> 44:21.248
(Screams)

44:21.322 --> 44:22.619
God, I've done it!

44:22.690 --> 44:24.920
I've done it! I've done it!

44:25.893 --> 44:27.793
Whoo!

44:36.670 --> 44:40.902
To mark the occasion, the technicians
let the engine play its party piece.

44:40.975 --> 44:44.968
(Engine howls God Save The Queen)

45:07.134 --> 45:09.102
Yes!

45:09.170 --> 45:11.138
I did it!

45:11.205 --> 45:12.467
Yeah.

45:12.540 --> 45:17.170
James, I happen to know...
No, no, really, I happen to know

45:17.244 --> 45:19.735
that after a while
when you'd been in the Formula One car,

45:19.813 --> 45:22.407
they had to pull it in to reheat the tires,

45:22.483 --> 45:25.316
'cause he was driving so slowly
they were cooling down.

45:25.386 --> 45:29.823
That did happen, but I experienced
full throttle in a Formula One car.

45:29.890 --> 45:32.654
Give him his due, he did use full throttle...

45:32.726 --> 45:34.660
for 0.2 seconds.

45:36.530 --> 45:39.465
Er... Anyway, it's now time
to meet another guest,

45:39.500 --> 45:43.493
and this one can drive a Formula One car,
even though he's only eight years old.

45:43.571 --> 45:46.039
Ladies and gentlemen, Lewis Hamilton!

45:46.106 --> 45:47.698
(Cheering)

45:47.775 --> 45:50.608
Yes! Hey, how are you?

45:50.678 --> 45:53.647
- Good to see you.
- Great to see you. Have a seat.

45:55.849 --> 45:58.511
He's here. He has come among us.

46:00.621 --> 46:03.283
This is what I think you can call
a friendly audience.

46:03.357 --> 46:05.257
It is. Thank you for the warm welcome.

46:05.326 --> 46:07.157
- You don't have to worry...
- But it is cold in here.

46:07.228 --> 46:09.560
- It is cold in here.
- I'm surprised.

46:09.630 --> 46:13.964
- Couldn't you afford a heater?
- No. Because we have all the money.

46:14.034 --> 46:17.834
Anyway, I want to start by offering -
I guess all of us will do the same -

46:17.905 --> 46:20.499
big congratulations for an astonishing first year.

46:20.574 --> 46:24.442
- Thank you very much.
- I have to start with that. Genuinely amazing.

46:24.511 --> 46:28.003
- Are you as amazed as we all are?
- I am, absolutely.

46:28.082 --> 46:30.642
Who would have thought?
I'm just your average guy.

46:30.718 --> 46:33.915
I just got an amazing opportunity
to come to Formula One,

46:33.988 --> 46:40.393
and I managed to just lose the championship
right at the end. But it was an amazing year.

46:40.461 --> 46:43.919
So when you arrived in Formula One,
it was Australia, wasn't it, the first race,

46:43.998 --> 46:47.832
- are you expected to behave like a new boy?
- Yeah, I think so.

46:47.901 --> 46:51.701
I think for sure, everyone expects this
is a new kid, he doesn't know what he's doing,

46:51.772 --> 46:54.502
and, you know,
he's going to be a breeze to pass.

46:54.575 --> 46:56.042
- That wasn't the case.
- It wasn't.

46:56.110 --> 46:59.045
The first race, you overtook Eyebrow Man.

46:59.113 --> 47:01.673
- (Laughter)
- Alonso.

47:01.749 --> 47:04.980
And the second one,
you put one on Massa, didn't you?

47:05.052 --> 47:06.713
It was. Massa and Kimi.

47:06.787 --> 47:09.551
- Was Kimi drunk?
- I don't know. I should have asked him.

47:09.623 --> 47:11.955
He was really on the left, this was Malaysia.

47:12.026 --> 47:17.157
He was on the left and probably didn't imagine
I would out-brake him up the inside.

47:17.231 --> 47:19.199
Singing Sham 69 songs.

47:19.266 --> 47:21.427
# We're going down the pub #

47:21.502 --> 47:23.493
Hurry up, Harry. Come on, oi, oi!

47:23.570 --> 47:26.403
Who was that?
That's that new boy that's gone past.

47:26.473 --> 47:29.033
Erm... We've just been watching
Richard Hammond

47:29.109 --> 47:32.101
making a complete clot of himself
in a Formula One car.

47:32.179 --> 47:36.081
- Are these things hard to drive?
- They are. They're very, very hard.

47:36.150 --> 47:39.586
When you're at high speed,
doing 150, 180 miles an hour,

47:39.653 --> 47:42.144
and you're through a corner and you hit a bump,

47:42.222 --> 47:45.020
you try to correct it
and the thing will shoot you off, so...

47:45.092 --> 47:50.997
Are you fearless? 'Cause you've already said,
"If you're going to die on a track, so be it,"

47:51.065 --> 47:52.862
kind of attitude.

47:52.933 --> 47:54.230
I don't think...

47:54.301 --> 47:58.931
Well, I'm not looking to waste my life,
but I've never had the problem of being scared.

47:59.006 --> 48:01.873
You never, ever think,
"What if a wheel comes off now?"

48:01.942 --> 48:05.105
- No, I've had that problem a couple of times.
- Well, quite!

48:05.179 --> 48:09.809
It is actually quite exciting
when you're flying headfirst into a barrier.

48:09.883 --> 48:14.183
- The initial part. The initial part is quite...
- (Laughter)

48:14.254 --> 48:17.690
No, it is. Especially when you hit the gravel trap
and you get some air. It's pretty cool.

48:17.758 --> 48:20.693
But then you see it coming
and you're like, "It's going to hurt."

48:20.761 --> 48:22.820
You do actually think it's going to hurt?

48:22.896 --> 48:26.059
I had a good one this year
at the beginning of the season.

48:26.133 --> 48:28.693
The team had worked very hard
to get two brand-new cars out,

48:28.769 --> 48:32.068
and I shunted it at 180mph
backwards into a wall.

48:32.139 --> 48:36.769
I remember going over the gravel backwards,
thinking, "This is gonna..." and bracing myself,

48:36.844 --> 48:39.711
and I put my head back
and it was actually quite a nice shunt.

48:42.149 --> 48:46.142
Why don't you just watch Die Hard 4?
That's exciting.

48:46.220 --> 48:50.247
So, who do you want to be your teammate
next year? Somebody useless, presumably.

48:52.259 --> 48:55.092
- You want a job?
- No, I can't fit in.

48:59.767 --> 49:05.728
It'd be embarrassing. That first race, you'd be
like, "Oh, the fat bloke's gonna be useless,"

49:05.806 --> 49:08.536
and history would repeat,
I'd come flying past you.

49:08.609 --> 49:10.270
- Yeah.
- Screaming.

49:10.344 --> 49:13.939
But do you want someone... Everybody
presumably wants somebody crap?

49:14.014 --> 49:18.678
No. Honestly, having someone this year
that could push me all the way was wicked.

49:18.752 --> 49:20.811
- And I learned so much from...
- Fernando?

49:20.888 --> 49:23.755
- He's a bloody good driver, I tell you.
- Yeah? I could have him.

49:23.824 --> 49:25.917
I did once, on the Oxford ring road.

49:27.528 --> 49:29.962
Honestly, he was doing, like, 80.
I came past, about 85.

49:30.030 --> 49:32.191
No, 65... I was doing 70.

49:33.467 --> 49:35.833
That hasn't worked, has it? No.

49:35.903 --> 49:40.738
With your driving now... Your dad's been very
much a part of the build-up of your career,

49:40.808 --> 49:44.209
does he still tell you how to drive,
like all dads do, if you're driving with him?

49:44.278 --> 49:48.612
Yeah, if we're on the road, he truly believes
he's a better driver than me,

49:48.682 --> 49:52.846
and that if he had been given the opportunity,
he would be in Formula One right now.

49:52.920 --> 49:55.548
So what have you got, a Mercedes?
Have you got one of those CLs?

49:55.622 --> 49:58.716
No. You know what, I drive a GL500.

49:58.792 --> 50:01.761
- Sorry, a GL420.
- Why didn't you get the 5? What?

50:01.829 --> 50:03.956
It's a diesel.

50:04.031 --> 50:08.525
- It's... It's a pimp wagon, you know.
- It's the fuel of Satan, man!

50:09.803 --> 50:13.170
You can fit 24-inch rims on it,
and just lean back and drive, man.

50:13.240 --> 50:15.174
That's all you need on the road.

50:15.242 --> 50:18.177
What are you saying about yourself?

50:18.245 --> 50:22.147
Now, there's one thing that we've noticed.
Martin Brundle...

50:22.216 --> 50:27.347
We've noticed that every time you don't do
so well in a race, Brundle has talked to you.

50:27.421 --> 50:29.150
- Talked to me.
- Have you noticed that?

50:29.223 --> 50:31.248
- I have.
- I think he's bitter.

50:31.325 --> 50:33.691
- Yeah.
- I think he's undoing things on your car.

50:34.862 --> 50:37.763
I believe that's what's going on. Hit him.

50:37.831 --> 50:39.560
No. I mean...

50:39.633 --> 50:42.193
Who'd win a fist fight, of all the British drivers?

50:42.269 --> 50:44.237
Erm...

50:46.139 --> 50:48.733
Well, I used to do boxing.
I used to do karate as well, so...

50:48.809 --> 50:52.438
- You're a black belt, aren't you?
- Yeah. I'm more into defending myself, so...

50:52.513 --> 50:54.879
You wouldn't want to hit Coulthard, with that...

50:54.948 --> 50:57.883
You'd break your wrist.
Probably break your hand, wouldn't you?

50:57.951 --> 51:01.443
- And I know Jenson doesn't like to...
- And there's stubble, as well.

51:01.522 --> 51:03.854
And... Oh, you know
when you look at a Formula One car,

51:03.924 --> 51:07.018
obviously every gram that you can save,
you save.

51:07.094 --> 51:09.619
There is just no excess fat on it.

51:09.696 --> 51:11.960
How come Jenson Button's
allowed to have a beard?

51:12.866 --> 51:15.562
No, but seriously, 'cause that's got to weigh...

51:15.636 --> 51:18.901
All the effort the designer makes
and then he turns up with that face fungus.

51:18.972 --> 51:23.102
I'd tell him to have a... Well, you haven't
started shaving yet, so you won't know.

51:23.176 --> 51:25.906
- I've got a little bit growing.
- Really?

51:25.979 --> 51:27.879
Have you got pubes yet?

51:31.652 --> 51:35.418
It happens. No, they grow. It's ugly.

51:35.489 --> 51:41.325
Erm, anyway, obviously,
we now have to arrive at this point.

51:42.329 --> 51:44.991
These are the Formula One people
who have been here before.

51:45.065 --> 51:47.659
Obviously, The Stig heads the board,
with 1.44.4.

51:47.734 --> 51:52.262
Mansell, Jenson Button, "Dill".
And then Mark Webber.

51:52.339 --> 51:56.036
Mark Webber was the only one who came when
it was wet, and I believe it's wet out there.

51:56.109 --> 52:00.307
It's very slippery out there, and you said
someone put oil on the track. Was it Mark?

52:00.380 --> 52:05.477
Well, seriously, earlier today we had the
Vauxhall VXR8 going round, which is Australian.

52:05.552 --> 52:09.784
And the only person you're really racing
is Mark Webber, who is... Australian.

52:09.856 --> 52:13.690
Now, I'm not suggesting he came down
and undid the diff on the Vauxhall,

52:13.760 --> 52:17.093
but it was spewing oil all over the track,
so you've got oil and water out there.

52:17.164 --> 52:21.624
So, really, wet, that's the time
you're aiming for, 1.47.1

52:21.702 --> 52:24.865
I'm actually a bit nervous about this,
'cause I had some fun out there.

52:24.938 --> 52:27.566
But I'm not here to compete.
Let's see what goes on.

52:27.641 --> 52:29.836
- Yeah, right!
- Honestly, I'm here to have fun.

52:29.910 --> 52:32.743
- Who'd like to see the lap?
- (All) Yeah!

52:32.813 --> 52:34.178
Play the tape.

52:34.247 --> 52:35.680
(Tires squeal)

52:35.749 --> 52:37.410
0h, that's an aggressive start.

52:37.484 --> 52:39.452
Wheel spin into second gear.

52:39.519 --> 52:41.544
(Laughs)

52:41.622 --> 52:43.180
Come on. Let's get going.

52:44.024 --> 52:48.017
Now, let's have a look.
Were you using The Stig's line or...

52:48.095 --> 52:52.293
No, that's where The Stig says it should go.
All the other F1 drivers go out wide.

52:52.366 --> 52:56.530
That wasn't too bad. I'd give it eight out of ten.

52:57.237 --> 52:59.501
- Right, now, into Chicago.
- Oh, a bit sideways.

52:59.573 --> 53:03.839
You're getting sideways on the way in,
that was very nice, and super-tight round there.

53:03.910 --> 53:06.242
- Now, what are you...
- Come on, man!

53:06.313 --> 53:08.110
56 miles an hour. What the?

53:10.050 --> 53:12.678
56 is quick. Now, this is where everyone gets...

53:14.221 --> 53:16.451
Looks quite slow and tidy through there.

53:16.523 --> 53:18.718
I was expecting more flamboyance.
Now, here we go.

53:18.792 --> 53:22.819
Look at the grip,
this thing will put Formula One cars to shame.

53:23.463 --> 53:26.261
It won't. It won't, it won't, it won't.

53:26.333 --> 53:30.429
There we are across... 0oh, you've gone for
the slippery inside bit there. And...

53:30.504 --> 53:33.735
(Hums)

53:34.608 --> 53:36.701
(Jeremy) Are you taking this seriously?

53:37.844 --> 53:39.971
I've never seen anyone so lackadaisical about...

53:40.047 --> 53:43.414
Whoa, that was lackadaisical but sideways.

53:43.483 --> 53:47.385
Coming up to Gambon now,
and that's pretty, pretty flamboyant.

53:47.454 --> 53:49.513
- And there we are!
- (Cheering)

53:49.589 --> 53:51.648
Across the line.

53:54.461 --> 53:56.429
So...

53:59.666 --> 54:02.396
- Quicker or slower?
- What do you think?

54:02.469 --> 54:05.063
- (All) Quicker!
- Mark's a quick guy.

54:05.138 --> 54:07.072
OK, you did it...

54:07.140 --> 54:09.631
Not competitive!

54:12.045 --> 54:13.603
...one minute...

54:13.680 --> 54:18.014
And bearing in mind this is on a track
covered in water and oil.

54:18.085 --> 54:21.919
...44.7.
- No!

54:21.988 --> 54:24.149
Unbelievable. There.

54:26.793 --> 54:30.422
And that's wet and oily. How did you do that?

54:32.032 --> 54:34.728
Seriously, I have to know.

54:34.801 --> 54:38.464
I have to know, because everybody out there,
including, I have to say, even The Stig,

54:38.538 --> 54:41.837
has to know, how did you do that?

54:42.743 --> 54:44.301
I don't know.

54:44.377 --> 54:47.005
- Because he's done a 44.4...
- That's my time.

54:47.080 --> 54:50.208
...and, let's be honest, he knows this place
like the back of his...

54:50.283 --> 54:54.310
He hasn't got hands, but you know what I mean.
He knows this place extremely well.

54:54.387 --> 54:57.322
You come down on a wet, oily track
and do a 44.7.

54:57.390 --> 55:01.156
And you weren't even...
We saw you, whoo-whoo-whoo, singing.

55:02.028 --> 55:05.555
- The car's good, you know.
- The car's crap, man! You know that.

55:06.466 --> 55:08.127
Do you think you could go faster?

55:08.201 --> 55:10.635
Are you going to invite me back
to do it on a dry day?

55:10.704 --> 55:13.730
I would absolutely love it if you'd come.
Everybody would.

55:13.807 --> 55:15.297
- I'd love to.
- It's been such a pleasure.

55:15.375 --> 55:18.640
I'm rooting for you next year.
I dare say everybody here is rooting for you.

55:18.712 --> 55:20.873
Ladies and gentlemen, Lewis Hamilton!

55:27.988 --> 55:30.149
Amazing. Astonishing.

55:30.223 --> 55:34.091
And that, sadly, is all we've got time for.
We have to end the show. Good night.

55:34.161 --> 55:37.597
- No, no, no, there's more on car controls.
- Oh, God.

55:37.664 --> 55:41.794
No, honestly, OK? Earlier on, we looked at the
past and now it's time to look at the future.

55:41.868 --> 55:42.892
Really?

55:42.969 --> 55:48.339
BMW called us up and they said they've built
a car that doesn't need any controls at all.

55:48.408 --> 55:52.777
- So how does it work?
- Well, they say they'd bring it to our track

55:52.846 --> 55:56.748
and then they'd show it round,
and then it would use really clever satnav

55:56.817 --> 56:00.116
to work out where it was,
so it could remember all the coordinates.

56:00.187 --> 56:01.814
- Really?
- Yeah, exactly.

56:01.888 --> 56:04.789
Really. I mean, I had to go and have a look.

56:07.627 --> 56:13.224
This is the most important car ever
in the whole of automotive history. Probably.

56:14.234 --> 56:20.935
It's a four-door BMW330 saloon, and
what I'm going to do now is take it for a spin.

56:23.076 --> 56:27.342
BMW say that because this car
has now learned our track,

56:27.414 --> 56:31.908
it can actually do a full-bore, smoking,
pedal-to-the metal lap.

56:31.985 --> 56:36.046
The only thing is, they say, "If you're going
to do that, would you sit behind the wheel

56:36.122 --> 56:38.454
"just in case something goes wrong?"

56:40.193 --> 56:42.661
Hmm. In case something goes wrong...

56:43.930 --> 56:47.024
I can't believe I'm going to do this.
I can't believe it.

56:49.069 --> 56:50.536
Right.

56:50.604 --> 56:52.196
My foot is on the brake.

56:52.272 --> 56:54.672
I'm now going to push this little button
on the steering wheel,

56:54.741 --> 57:00.043
and it will set off at, erm, race speed.

57:00.113 --> 57:01.580
Here we go.

57:01.648 --> 57:03.616
(Bleep and engine revving)

57:08.622 --> 57:11.614
Now... Now, you see, that's uncanny.

57:11.691 --> 57:15.559
It's revving up to 7,000rpm, changing gear.

57:15.629 --> 57:19.622
It's turned right. It's coming to the first corner.
Brake, please. Brake, brake, brake!

57:20.567 --> 57:22.933
Brake! Brake!

57:23.003 --> 57:26.268
It... It is! And I can't believe this!

57:28.608 --> 57:33.671
Coming up to the tires at 100kph,
that's 62, as we brake to turn into Chicago.

57:35.448 --> 57:38.383
As we steam towards the Hammerhead now,

57:38.451 --> 57:41.978
100mph, and it's gonna go hard on the brakes.

57:42.055 --> 57:46.116
It has! There it is. I'm not doing that.
My foot is still nowhere near the pedals.

57:46.192 --> 57:48.160
It's turning in.

57:49.129 --> 57:51.461
Imagine if the British had built this.

57:51.531 --> 57:54.466
(Midlands accent)
Ah, well, we didn't get it quite right.

57:54.534 --> 57:56.764
We just missed that little bit out there.

57:57.537 --> 58:00.938
Is it going to lift for the follow-through?
We're now up to 130kph.

58:01.007 --> 58:05.569
140. Apparently, you can even put this
on an M3 if you really want to frighten yourself.

58:05.645 --> 58:07.169
To death!

58:07.247 --> 58:11.013
Coming up to the tires, here we go. 120, 130.

58:11.084 --> 58:15.043
This is 95 miles an hour through the tires.
Bang on!

58:15.789 --> 58:17.984
Please don't get it wrong.
Please don't get it wrong.

58:18.058 --> 58:20.322
And it's just changed up to fourth.

58:20.393 --> 58:24.853
Brake, brake, brake, brake, brake!
Second to last corner! Come on, brake!

58:24.931 --> 58:27.593
(Grunts)

58:27.667 --> 58:30.135
Stig, you are sacked.

58:30.203 --> 58:33.263
You are so sacked! It's unbelievable!

58:33.974 --> 58:35.942
Now...

58:36.643 --> 58:39.305
Now, how do I stop it? Erm...

58:41.748 --> 58:44.012
I forgot to ask the man how I stop it.

58:45.185 --> 58:47.153
It's, erm...

58:48.188 --> 58:51.021
I'm going to be out here for the rest of my life!

58:51.091 --> 58:54.254
How much petrol's it got in it?
Three quarters of a tank.

59:25.158 --> 59:26.523
I'm bored now!

59:27.305 --> 59:33.843
