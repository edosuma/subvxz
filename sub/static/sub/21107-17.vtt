patient, stat.

19:49.889 --> 19:51.689
And ow!

19:52.291 --> 19:53.524
Aww, how pretty.

19:53.526 --> 19:57.361
It's like a goo-globe,
all ready for Creepmas.

19:57.363 --> 19:58.696
(GASPING)

19:58.698 --> 20:01.766
I guess there's only one thing
left to do.

20:05.070 --> 20:07.538
Mavis?
You're my surgical patient?

20:07.540 --> 20:11.042
I didn't think you had
any confidence in me.

20:11.044 --> 20:11.576
I do!

20:11.578 --> 20:15.479
But I don't have any idea how
to be a medical professional.

20:15.481 --> 20:17.014
Are you sure about that?

20:17.016 --> 20:19.717
You've taken care of us
for years.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.452
You squeezed Wendy
out of the tube

20:21.454 --> 20:22.954
when she was
just a blobette.

20:22.956 --> 20:25.356
You gave Hank
that gangrenous thumb.

20:25.358 --> 20:27.592
You took out Pedro's tonsils.

20:27.594 --> 20:30.194
Yeah, and I didn't
even need 'em out!

20:30.196 --> 20:31.362
You can do this.

20:31.364 --> 20:34.398
Do it your way.
The Gillman way!

20:34.400 --> 20:36.300
Okay, I will.

20:36.302 --> 20:36.834
And don't worry,

20:36.836 --> 20:39.170
I've never lost a patient
on the operating table.

20:39.172 --> 20:43.674
I mean, a lot have died,
but I haven't lost any of 'em.

20:49.281 --> 20:50.648
(GULPING)

20:54.920 --> 20:57.255
I believe in you!

21:00.993 --> 21:03.394
(ALARM BLARING)

21:03.862 --> 21:05.529
(EXPLOSION)

21:13.305 --> 21:16.974
I may only have one eye,
but this looks good to me.

21:16.976 --> 21:20.344
Congratulations,
Doctor Gillman.

21:20.346 --> 21:22.413
(ALL CHEERING)

21:22.415 --> 21:26.617
I guess all those years
faking being a doctor
really paid off.

21:26.619 --> 21:27.785
(GIGGLING) Yep.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.153
But you're official now.

21:29.155 --> 21:31.289
And if anyone would know,
it's her.

21:31.291 --> 21:33.391
Actually, I never went
to inspector school.

21:33.393 --> 21:35.293
I just wandered
into their class photo,

21:35.295 --> 21:37.395
got a clipboard,
and here I am.

21:37.397 --> 21:40.298
Well, see you
in 500 years!

21:41.366 --> 21:42.900
(GASPING)

21:43.302 --> 21:45.202
Mavis, what was that?

21:45.204 --> 21:47.171
What is going on
in here?

21:47.173 --> 21:48.839
Um, long story.

21:48.841 --> 21:50.508
Well, come, Dr. Gillman,

21:50.510 --> 21:51.742
I've been looking
all over for you.

21:51.744 --> 21:55.146
The corns on my feet
have grown angry.

21:55.148 --> 21:56.414
(CORNS HISSING)

21:56.416 --> 21:57.448
(GASPING)

21:57.450 --> 21:59.583
You wanted to be
a doctor again.

21:59.585 --> 22:04.188
I'll get some
butter and salt.

22:06.291 --> 22:08.693
(MUSIC PLAYING)

22:09.594 --> 22:12.630
(VOCALIZING)
