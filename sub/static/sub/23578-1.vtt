Hey, watch out!

00:18.642 --> 00:20.942
Are you crazy? You almost killed me!

00:21.011 --> 00:22.911
- Oh, that was crazy, huh?
- What were you doing?

00:22.979 --> 00:24.679
- Yeah, so sorry to scare you.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:24.748 --> 00:26.247
Where you going? Where you going?

00:26.316 --> 00:27.782
I thought you wanted to talk.

00:27.851 --> 00:29.050
Huh, you were talking before, man.

00:29.119 --> 00:30.673
What happened?

00:37.360 --> 00:38.726
All right, everybody, let's go ahead

00:38.795 --> 00:40.222
and start to shut up now.

00:40.927 --> 00:43.327
Let's go ahead and start
to settle into your seats

00:43.396 --> 00:45.502
and begin shutting your mouths.

00:46.032 --> 00:48.309
All rights, so my name...

00:59.200 --> 01:00.834
My name's Jack Griffin.

01:04.611 --> 01:05.799
And I don't wanna be here.

01:06.951 --> 01:08.784
I am an award-winning
philosophy scholar,

01:08.853 --> 01:10.419
who for reasons I won't go in to

01:10.488 --> 01:12.021
finds himself with a free year.

01:12.278 --> 01:15.057
So I'm living in my dead
mom's apartment here in Toledo

01:15.126 --> 01:17.478
while killing a little
bit of time teaching...

01:19.017 --> 01:21.395
Advanced Placement Biology.

01:21.856 --> 01:24.633
But here's the deal, I
do not care about biology.

01:24.702 --> 01:26.412
We're not gonna do any biology in here.

01:26.459 --> 01:27.692
And to be perfectly clear,

01:27.761 --> 01:28.893
this won't be one of those things

01:28.962 --> 01:30.528
where over the course of a year

01:30.597 --> 01:32.830
I secretly teach it to you.

01:33.298 --> 01:34.998
This also won't be one of those things

01:35.067 --> 01:37.300
where I end up learning more from you

01:37.369 --> 01:39.135
than you do from me.

01:39.204 --> 01:40.937
I know more than all of you combined,

01:41.006 --> 01:43.152
so, ha, that doesn't make any sense.

01:43.408 --> 01:45.400
I'm gonna spend the majority of my time

01:45.556 --> 01:47.956
mentally breaking my nemesis

01:48.003 --> 01:50.650
with the ultimate goal of taking his job

01:50.650 --> 01:52.250
as the head of Stanford Philosophy

01:52.317 --> 01:54.651
and then I'm gonna have
sex with as many women

01:54.720 --> 01:58.069
as I possibly can throughout
the entire state of California.

01:58.590 --> 02:01.491
But you don't need to
concern yourselves with that.

02:01.962 --> 02:03.427
Uh, let's see.

02:03.495 --> 02:05.095
Feel like I might be
forgetting something.

02:05.530 --> 02:06.996
"Mentally breaking my nemesis,

02:07.064 --> 02:09.079
"sex with every woman in
California." No, that was it.

02:37.197 --> 02:39.275
and you want good GPAs, all right?

02:39.314 --> 02:40.702
Is that what's going on here?

02:40.849 --> 02:42.103

You guys are all tired teens.

02:50.412 --> 02:52.312
This is gonna be your
opportunity to take a nap.

02:52.381 --> 02:54.029
And if you're not tired,

02:55.384 --> 02:56.851
pop an Advil PM,

02:57.386 --> 02:59.052
and you will be out, trust me.

02:59.720 --> 03:01.319
What are you doing? Come
on, put your hand down.

03:01.388 --> 03:03.545
I'm serious. You're months
away from being an adult,

03:03.545 --> 03:04.945
and you need to start acting like one.

03:05.014 --> 03:06.079
Just... talk.

03:06.148 --> 03:07.894
My name is Sarika Sarkar,

03:08.050 --> 03:10.117
and I speak on behalf of
the entire student body

03:10.185 --> 03:12.914
when I express our extreme displeasure

03:12.994 --> 03:14.360
in you not teaching us biology.

03:14.428 --> 03:15.668
I'm sorry, could you say it again?

03:15.982 --> 03:17.448
I believe I speak on behalf...

03:17.517 --> 03:18.816
No, no, not that junk.

03:19.104 --> 03:20.184
Your name.

03:20.253 --> 03:22.319
Oh, Sarika Sarkar.

03:22.814 --> 03:23.968
That's a great name.

03:24.792 --> 03:27.159
I love the philosopher Prabhat Sarkar.

03:27.315 --> 03:31.117
The entire universe exists
within the cosmic mind.

03:31.486 --> 03:33.853
What are you guys doing?
Don't write that down.

03:33.878 --> 03:35.295
That's not me teaching you stuff.

03:36.265 --> 03:37.622
Who's this prince of darkness?

03:38.201 --> 03:39.379
This your book?

03:39.569 --> 03:41.814
- _
- Yeah? So?

03:41.923 --> 03:43.689
Mr. Griffin?

03:44.228 --> 03:45.707
I think you're in trouble.

03:46.057 --> 03:47.274
Could we, uh...

03:47.343 --> 03:49.582
Could I talk to you out
here for a second?

03:49.691 --> 03:50.759
Uh-huh.

03:55.384 --> 03:56.891
Could I get a new chair?

03:57.111 --> 03:59.444
A new cha... well, I don't
know if that's in our budget.

03:59.514 --> 04:00.513
- It's fine, forget it.
- Okay.

04:00.582 --> 04:01.928
Forget it. What's up?

04:01.953 --> 04:03.231
- What's up?
- Um...

04:04.255 --> 04:05.733
Is it laundry day or...

04:06.434 --> 04:08.023
What's that supposed to mean, man?

04:08.092 --> 04:09.839
I probably forgot to tell you,

04:09.839 --> 04:11.939
we sort of have a bit of
a dress code here, so...

04:12.007 --> 04:14.277
Hey, look, Ralph, I
want to wear sweatpants.

04:14.375 --> 04:16.175
You want to say that your school's got

04:16.200 --> 04:18.010
a former Harvard professor
teaching at it, right?

04:18.046 --> 04:19.591
Looks good for your school, right?

04:19.591 --> 04:21.358
Okay, please, I wasn't
trying to be aggressive here.

04:21.427 --> 04:23.987
Right, but what you said
to me right now, it sucked.

04:24.038 --> 04:25.638
- Okay.
- You know, the worst part is

04:25.663 --> 04:27.083
I was starting to like you, man.

04:27.126 --> 04:29.714
You know, like in a buds who get
drinks once a week kind of a way.

04:29.714 --> 04:31.014
Well, that's... that's us.

04:31.039 --> 04:33.108
- We could still do that.
- I don't know.

04:33.143 --> 04:34.376
I... you know what, I think you're just

04:34.401 --> 04:35.666
blowing this thing out of proportion.

04:35.691 --> 04:37.496
Because I'm a laidback principal.

04:37.565 --> 04:38.931
You know, they make me wear this suit.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.566
I don't want to dress
this sharp every day,

04:40.635 --> 04:42.702
but I have to 'cause
I'm an authority figure,

04:42.770 --> 04:45.487
but I'm still laidback,
and you're gonna see that.

04:45.773 --> 04:46.806
You know what,

04:47.768 --> 04:49.232
let's forget the whole thing.

04:49.503 --> 04:50.669
- Come here.
- All right, I... I...

04:50.738 --> 04:53.339
Come here.

04:53.407 --> 04:54.471
That's my guy.

04:54.537 --> 04:56.449
Do you still wanna get
that beer tonight or...

04:56.474 --> 04:57.810
No. No, no, no.

04:57.865 --> 05:00.489
See, I'm trying to make a
plan to bang my high school ex

05:00.514 --> 05:02.214
as hard as I can, you
know what I'm saying?

05:02.253 --> 05:04.087
Let's use our hallway voice
when we talk about that.

05:04.155 --> 05:05.655
Yes, I'm trying to set that up.

05:05.724 --> 05:07.608
- All right.
- Okay.

05:08.535 --> 05:09.686
All right.

05:10.877 --> 05:12.410
You wrecked the sign.

05:12.478 --> 05:14.299
That's why I came here to...

05:15.076 --> 05:17.315
It's too late, Ralph, It's too late.

05:17.708 --> 05:20.051
Uh, let's see a hall pass.

07:01.192 --> 07:02.834
Okay, so it was crazy, right?

07:02.903 --> 07:04.803
So then my date shows up to my house

07:04.871 --> 07:06.671
in a soaking wet T-shirt,

07:06.740 --> 07:08.707
talking about something he
just got out of the bath.

07:08.775 --> 07:11.576
Now what kinda grown
baby man still takes baths?

07:11.645 --> 07:13.211
See, that's what I said.
It's like, who is this?

07:13.280 --> 07:14.732
My husband takes baths.

07:15.315 --> 07:16.681
- Yeah.
- Okay.

07:16.750 --> 07:19.890
Okay, so anyway, the
date was at a full medium,

07:19.915 --> 07:23.516
and he has the nerve to text
me, like, ten minutes ago,

07:23.585 --> 07:25.118
talking about some, "Do a butt pic."

07:25.187 --> 07:26.920
- Huh?
- Okay, he sounds like a jerk.

07:26.989 --> 07:29.055
But do you want us to
take a pic of your butt?

07:29.124 --> 07:30.557
No, no, no, no, 'cause
see, this is how I do it.

07:30.625 --> 07:31.858
Okay, so now the dumb ones don't know

07:31.927 --> 07:33.360
that this is an arm butt.

07:33.428 --> 07:34.995
- Hmm.
- So then I take this.

07:35.063 --> 07:37.464
And I just go ahead and
just line that up.

07:37.532 --> 07:39.332
Let that focus a little bit.

07:39.401 --> 07:41.034
There we go. Little juicy cheeks.

07:41.103 --> 07:42.569
- That looks like a crack.
- Juicy, okay.

07:42.637 --> 07:44.828
See the new guy knows what's up.

07:44.930 --> 07:47.540
- It's Jack, right? From Harvard?
- Yeah.

07:47.609 --> 07:49.342
Ooh, Harvard Jack.

07:49.411 --> 07:51.852
All right, well, have you
been out on any dates lately?

07:51.963 --> 07:54.485
Funny you should ask,
I've actually got firm plans

07:54.532 --> 07:57.250
to bang my high school ex as
hard as I can tonight, so...

07:57.319 --> 07:59.310
Oh, he's gonna bang her

07:59.335 --> 08:01.540
as hard as he can tonight.

08:01.580 --> 08:03.633
Not regular hard. Aggressively hard.

08:04.033 --> 08:05.635
So it seems like you're
enjoying yourself here?

08:05.704 --> 08:08.306
God no. I'm teaching
high school in Toledo.

08:08.573 --> 08:09.886
It's terrible.

08:11.315 --> 08:13.415
Anyways, guess what I'm
making the kids do

08:13.484 --> 08:15.150
- in my class today.
- What?

08:15.219 --> 08:17.152
They have to draw a
flattering picture of me

08:17.221 --> 08:18.954
and then give it to their dads.

08:19.023 --> 08:20.689
Ooh, yes, you know what I tell my kids.

08:20.758 --> 08:21.890
Okay, 'cause you know how we're learning

08:21.959 --> 08:23.559
- about recycling, right?
- Mm-hmm.

08:23.627 --> 08:24.693
I just made them clean the trash

08:24.731 --> 08:25.871
out the backseat of my car.

08:25.901 --> 08:27.801
Snatch that plastic and recycle it.

08:28.689 --> 08:29.740
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

08:29.765 --> 08:31.633

the kids do whatever we want?

08:31.659 --> 08:33.053
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

08:37.082 --> 08:38.879
- This better work.
- Always does.

08:40.549 --> 08:42.364
go ahead and start to shut your mouths.

Don't ever surprise me with a rap.

09:10.515 --> 09:11.884
Don't ever rap about learning.

09:11.885 --> 09:14.186
Oh, boy.

09:17.892 --> 09:18.845
Oh, no.

09:19.293 --> 09:21.133
You had a saxophone solo in your rap?

09:21.664 --> 09:23.029
Yeah. That's too bad.

09:23.571 --> 09:25.054
Why don't you come on
out of there, big guy.

09:26.324 --> 09:28.417
Wanna toss that puppy
in the trash for me?

09:29.235 --> 09:30.497
- Yeah.
- Good.

09:30.972 --> 09:33.599
Saxophones do not belong in rap music.

09:34.536 --> 09:36.159
You were gonna make it rain, huh?

09:38.402 --> 09:40.184
Wet notebooks part of the rap thing?

09:41.431 --> 09:42.456
No.

09:45.390 --> 09:46.406
All right.

09:48.749 --> 09:50.749
Now look, I realize I haven't been

09:50.818 --> 09:52.784
making the most of your
time, but that is gonna

09:52.853 --> 09:54.753
start to change as of right now.

09:54.822 --> 09:56.688
As I mentioned, I've
been trying to mentally

09:56.757 --> 09:59.090
break my nemesis, Miles Leonard.

09:59.159 --> 10:01.226
He currently has the job
that is rightfully mine,

10:01.251 --> 10:02.517
and I want it back.

10:02.629 --> 10:03.894
He seems to be winning at the moment,

10:03.894 --> 10:05.694
but by the time we're done with him,

10:06.026 --> 10:08.126
he's gonna be in a loony
bin begging for death.

10:08.371 --> 10:09.828
Don't you think you'd
have a better chance

10:09.896 --> 10:11.329
of getting the job if you
focused on working hard

10:11.398 --> 10:13.398
as opposed to trying
to make him go crazy?

10:13.423 --> 10:14.855
No, you see my actions are justified

10:14.880 --> 10:16.847
because they produce a better outcome

10:17.224 --> 10:19.158
than any other action
in this particular case.

10:19.226 --> 10:20.559
It's a basic philosophy,

10:20.628 --> 10:22.995
act utilitarianism, Jeremy Bentham.

10:23.397 --> 10:24.658
Stop writing that down.

10:24.965 --> 10:27.702
Now I happen to know that
Miles is currently single.

10:28.201 --> 10:31.736
So your assignment for
today is to catfish him

10:32.084 --> 10:33.506
on his Facebook page.

10:36.510 --> 10:38.743
What are you guys waiting for? Catfish!

10:38.812 --> 10:40.478
Write a flirty Facebook message,

10:40.547 --> 10:42.213
you know, using a fake name.

10:42.282 --> 10:44.349
You call yourself, like, Linda,

10:44.418 --> 10:45.915
and we'll send the best one to Miles.

10:45.986 --> 10:47.385
All right, look, at this
point you guys should all be

10:47.454 --> 10:49.051
catfishing or dead asleep.

10:56.744 --> 10:58.853
So if you Google Jack Griffin,

10:58.947 --> 11:01.017
the first ten results are this video.

11:01.452 --> 11:04.386
"Old dude handles
slightly less old dude."

11:07.124 --> 11:09.458
Whoa.

11:09.526 --> 11:11.193
_

11:11.261 --> 11:13.595
Okay, everybody, begin to shut up.

11:13.664 --> 11:15.263
Let's everyone shut your mouths now

11:15.332 --> 11:16.802
and settle into your chairs.

11:17.005 --> 11:20.373
All right, let's hear some
of these catfish messages.

11:20.824 --> 11:23.091
- You wanna start?
- Please no.

11:23.160 --> 11:25.077
All right. Prince of Darkness,

11:25.125 --> 11:26.952
I see you working on something
over there. What you got?

11:27.757 --> 11:30.591
"Dear Miles, you don't
know me but you will.

11:30.660 --> 11:33.526
"We will marry under the
black sun of Satan's breath.

11:34.597 --> 11:36.263
"I'll be the final face you see

11:36.308 --> 11:38.141
"as I wrap my hands around your neck

11:38.190 --> 11:40.150
and suck your soul into my mouth."

11:40.536 --> 11:43.137
Wow, somebody alert the authorities.

11:43.206 --> 11:44.366
You know what I mean?

11:45.241 --> 11:47.007
No, I'm kidding, I'm
joking. It's great, really.

11:47.076 --> 11:48.722
It's very descriptive.

11:48.747 --> 11:51.958
You know, maybe just make it
a little bit more, uh, female.

11:52.136 --> 11:55.824
You know? All right, you.

11:56.374 --> 11:57.888
I want to hear something from you.

12:01.457 --> 12:03.393
- "Hey, boy, you're..."
- Louder.

12:04.148 --> 12:05.982
"Hey, boy, you're smooth

12:06.050 --> 12:08.331
"like butter dripping off of chocolate.

12:08.495 --> 12:10.261
"Gonna lick you up and down.

12:10.330 --> 12:12.442
"Drip, slurp, yum.

12:12.442 --> 12:15.568
Give me that sweet wet sugar mess."

12:16.255 --> 12:18.078
Hmm, no. Let's do keep in mind

12:18.147 --> 12:20.445
that this will be the first message

12:20.492 --> 12:23.225
that Miles will be hearing
from a total stranger,

12:23.250 --> 12:25.349
but, you know, it's a great start.

12:26.157 --> 12:27.178
Good.

12:27.179 --> 12:28.812
- Mr. Griffin.
- Oh!

12:28.881 --> 12:30.314
Ralph, you snuck up on me.

12:30.382 --> 12:33.350
Yeah, uh, I put in your
request for the new chair,

12:33.419 --> 12:35.218
and so that's in front of the board now.

12:35.243 --> 12:37.254
Okay, great, well, let me
know how they vote, all right?

12:37.323 --> 12:39.122
- This is biology?
- Oh, absolutely.

12:39.152 --> 12:40.248
Sugar mess?

12:40.286 --> 12:41.886
Yeah, we're in the
middle of it. Take care now.

12:42.137 --> 12:43.904
Whoa, look at the Prince of
D going strong over there.

12:43.973 --> 12:45.539
Give us another snippet.

12:45.607 --> 12:47.951
"And fire and blood
will pour from my eyes

12:47.995 --> 12:49.980
"as I gaze upon your ravaged body.

12:50.349 --> 12:53.517
By the way, I am a female demon."

12:53.730 --> 12:56.564
I see a lot of myself in you.
You are going places, Devin.

12:57.210 --> 12:59.043
You guys are pretty good
at this. You having fun?

12:59.086 --> 13:00.986
- Yeah.
- All right, who's next?

13:06.282 --> 13:07.304
"Dear Miles,

13:07.334 --> 13:10.085
"I want to make you
blush, make you feel safe.

13:10.452 --> 13:12.915
"I want to lay next to
you and laugh until we cry.

13:13.455 --> 13:16.556
"I want to grow old together,
and when we're old we'll say,

13:16.625 --> 13:18.694
'I don't mind because I have you.'"

13:21.555 --> 13:22.927
That's what I'm talking about, guys.

13:22.977 --> 13:24.366
Give it up, give it up.

13:25.767 --> 13:27.420
All right, let's go home.

13:27.902 --> 13:30.312
But we have other classes.

13:30.705 --> 13:31.887
All right, whatever.

13:33.697 --> 13:35.441
So that pretty much
catches you up to speed

13:35.510 --> 13:37.410
on what I've been up
to since we broke up.

13:38.329 --> 13:40.708
Um, you skipped a part, Jack.

13:41.074 --> 13:42.047
Did I?

13:42.150 --> 13:44.837
Well, I heard that you
got passed up for tenure,

13:44.910 --> 13:46.982
and now no university will touch you.

13:47.312 --> 13:49.279
I also heard that a very old guy

13:49.304 --> 13:51.176
got you in some kind of a choke hold.

13:51.683 --> 13:53.968
How'd I skip that part?
That's the juicy part.

13:56.187 --> 13:59.730
What do you say we go back
to your place after this?

14:01.650 --> 14:03.105
My boyfriend is finishing

14:03.106 --> 14:04.864
his rounds in an hour at the hospital,

14:04.864 --> 14:06.570
and I'm gonna actually meet up with him.

14:07.600 --> 14:09.491
You should. Yeah, no, that's, uh...

14:13.698 --> 14:14.821
Damn it!

14:15.408 --> 14:16.968
Ugh!

14:17.047 --> 14:18.586
_

14:18.611 --> 14:19.844
Oh, damn it!

14:19.912 --> 14:22.813
God! Agh!

14:27.880 --> 14:30.120
Okay, class, um,

14:30.359 --> 14:33.905
Mr. Griffin is not coming in today.

14:33.930 --> 14:35.463
According to the note we got,

14:35.531 --> 14:38.813
he has been put in prison,

14:39.066 --> 14:42.006
but, quote, not for life.

14:42.871 --> 14:44.160
Coach Novak.

14:44.160 --> 14:45.615
Textbooks out.

14:46.286 --> 14:47.227
What?

14:47.296 --> 14:49.730
Welcome. My name is Sarika Sarkar.

14:49.799 --> 14:51.198
Wait, what's your name?

14:51.586 --> 14:52.927
Sarika Sarkar.

14:53.337 --> 14:55.370
Like the philosopher.

14:55.433 --> 14:56.977
I'm gonna call you Sarah, all right?

14:57.243 --> 14:58.809
Can anyone tell me where you're at?

14:58.852 --> 15:01.150
We are...

15:01.175 --> 15:03.141
- Ten pushups.
- Say what now?

15:03.210 --> 15:05.405
20. You owe me ten pushups

15:05.449 --> 15:07.782
for every time you spoke
without raising your hand.

15:07.851 --> 15:09.088
Okay.

15:09.953 --> 15:11.773
What the hell is this puddle?

15:12.667 --> 15:16.068
Get a mop to dry that up
then go to the principal

15:16.138 --> 15:18.036
and say you need a Saturday detention.

15:18.664 --> 15:21.865
Okay, bio-logy. You
with the glasses, read.

15:22.028 --> 15:24.628
"The cell is the basic structural..."

15:24.697 --> 15:26.397
All right, thanks, man.
I got it from here.

15:26.465 --> 15:27.698
Appreciate it.

15:27.767 --> 15:28.933
Listen, I've never begun a class

15:28.958 --> 15:30.401
and not finished it before.

15:30.469 --> 15:31.535
Good for you.

15:31.604 --> 15:32.803
I go from bell to bell.

15:32.872 --> 15:34.839
It's cool, man. I got it
from here though, seriously.

15:35.539 --> 15:37.842
Okay, let me catch you guys up.

15:37.910 --> 15:41.245
So last night I found
out my nemesis Miles

15:41.314 --> 15:43.214
got a MacArthur Genius Grant

15:43.282 --> 15:45.416
just after my ex turned my down for sex.

15:45.484 --> 15:47.585
So I got angry, I got very drunk,

15:47.653 --> 15:50.487
and I went pee-pee on the
hospital where she works.

15:51.039 --> 15:53.239
A police officer suggested that I stop.

15:53.308 --> 15:55.809
I suggested that he
pleasure me sexually.

15:56.083 --> 15:57.161
He did not.

15:57.946 --> 16:01.436
Instead, he hurt my
arm, and I went to jail.

16:03.865 --> 16:06.586
So that catches you guys up to speed.

16:06.655 --> 16:09.271
Why don't we get back to work
on destroying Miles' sanity.

16:17.322 --> 16:18.521
Yeah, hang on.

16:21.352 --> 16:23.503
Hey, Ralph, Devin.

16:23.891 --> 16:25.238
You guys hang out?

16:25.307 --> 16:29.070
No, Devin got himself arrested earlier.

16:29.183 --> 16:33.119
They got him on public
urination and resisting arrest.

16:33.187 --> 16:35.521
What? No way, they literally got me

16:35.590 --> 16:36.889
for that same thing last night.

16:37.241 --> 16:38.247
It's quotas.

16:38.247 --> 16:42.215
Yeah, turns out Devin went potty

16:42.284 --> 16:46.186
on the house of a boy
who is bullying him.

16:46.733 --> 16:48.407
I was literally telling the kids today

16:48.407 --> 16:50.262
how I did a very similar thing.

16:50.777 --> 16:52.117
Ah.

16:52.912 --> 16:54.145
Oh, crap.

16:56.022 --> 16:58.590
All right, so this bully kid.

16:58.592 --> 17:00.158
He's been throwing your
backpack in the water

17:00.160 --> 17:01.259
and stuff like that for how long?

17:01.411 --> 17:02.844
Um, maybe a year.

17:02.846 --> 17:03.937
A year?

17:05.193 --> 17:06.564
And you didn't know any of this?

17:07.093 --> 17:09.045
That doesn't look great for you, bud.

17:09.229 --> 17:10.398
But you know what,

17:10.819 --> 17:13.020
I think we've all learned
a valuable lesson here,

17:13.021 --> 17:15.172
and we can definitely move on.

17:16.167 --> 17:17.901
Ralph, give me one of
those big-ass hugs.

17:17.903 --> 17:19.836
No, I... no, I don't
want to hug right now.

17:20.019 --> 17:23.006
I think you need to
step up and talk to him.

17:23.008 --> 17:26.070
Any other principal would have
fired you and expelled you.

17:26.329 --> 17:29.397
All right, but I'm
laidback, but right now

17:29.531 --> 17:32.333
you two are making it very hard for me

17:32.336 --> 17:33.871
to be laidback!

17:36.121 --> 17:37.405
Very authoritative, I like that.

17:37.407 --> 17:38.740
I've not seen that gear from you.

17:38.955 --> 17:40.904
- I like it.
- Thank you.

17:41.173 --> 17:42.639
Uh, listen, Ralph, can
you give Devin and I

17:42.641 --> 17:45.282
- a minute alone?
- Yes, yes, of course.

17:46.607 --> 17:48.595
- Oh, I'm going up?
- Give it a sec.

17:48.743 --> 17:51.625
- Okay.
- I did it.

17:52.046 --> 17:53.219
All right, so look,

17:54.048 --> 17:55.514
I haven't done a lot of these talks.

17:55.516 --> 17:56.698
I don't have kids.

17:56.698 --> 17:58.164
I've always been pretty good
about using condoms, you know?

17:58.245 --> 17:59.826
Even though I hate the damn things.

17:59.952 --> 18:01.301
You can't feel as much.

18:01.858 --> 18:03.169
All right, look, here's the deal.

18:03.642 --> 18:07.249
I want to be open and honest
with you kids in class, okay?

18:07.312 --> 18:09.312
But if it's gonna start
getting us all in trouble,

18:09.314 --> 18:10.847
then I'm gonna have to start acting

18:10.849 --> 18:12.317
like all the other teachers.

18:12.617 --> 18:13.850
See what I'm saying?

18:13.852 --> 18:15.985
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

18:15.987 --> 18:18.020
So next time you're thinking
about, like, imitating me

18:18.022 --> 18:21.357
or doing anything extreme in general,

18:21.359 --> 18:23.397
why don't you go ahead and
run it by me first, deal?

18:24.162 --> 18:25.190
Yeah.

18:26.531 --> 18:28.698
- Great.
- Hey, I'm still up here!

18:28.700 --> 18:31.401
Ready to come down. This
is gonna sound crazy.

18:31.403 --> 18:32.969
- I think I see a raccoon.
- No, there's...

18:32.971 --> 18:34.690
It's not crazy. There's one up there.

18:40.779 --> 18:44.514
<i>♪ Well we've got a lot a lot a lot
of hard work today ♪</i>

18:44.516 --> 18:47.850
<i>♪ We gotta rock at the
government center ♪</i>

18:48.916 --> 18:50.386
<i>Now I'm wondering if all the times</i>

18:50.388 --> 18:51.888
my husband sent me pictures of his butt,

18:51.890 --> 18:53.448
it was really his arm.

18:53.448 --> 18:55.609
Wait, your husband sent you butt pics?

18:55.788 --> 18:57.232
- Yeah.
- What's it look like?

18:57.232 --> 18:58.731
- Okay, I don't wanna know.
- There's a muscle...

18:58.733 --> 19:00.700
- Oh, look who it is.
- Oh, look you.

19:00.702 --> 19:02.802
Big man in a big chair.

19:02.804 --> 19:04.704
Yeah, it's a massage chair.

19:04.706 --> 19:06.139
Hmm, well, I like it.

19:06.141 --> 19:07.840
It's like nice, soft, supple leather.

19:07.842 --> 19:09.709
Yeah, it's pretty comfy.

19:09.711 --> 19:11.444
Listen, ladies, I have a
little bit of a school issue

19:11.446 --> 19:12.745
that I could use your help with.

19:12.747 --> 19:14.414
What do you do when one of the students

19:14.416 --> 19:16.349
- is bullying another one?
- Oh, oh, that's easy.

19:16.351 --> 19:19.085
Okay, so you want to keep them
around each other constantly.

19:19.087 --> 19:21.187
- Oh, yes, that totally works.
- Mm-hmm.

19:21.189 --> 19:23.089
That's actually how we
all became friends.

19:23.091 --> 19:25.291
'Cause Stef and I would
bully Michelle, naturally,

19:25.293 --> 19:27.293
and then Principal
Durbin started forcing us

19:27.295 --> 19:28.628
to hang out with one another.

19:28.630 --> 19:30.230
Mm-hmm, I would take one bite

19:30.232 --> 19:31.831
out of all of her food in the fridge.

19:31.833 --> 19:33.866
And I would sneak a few bites as well.

19:33.868 --> 19:35.401
Yes, she did.

19:35.403 --> 19:37.370
Then one time I set her purse on fire.

19:37.372 --> 19:38.605
Whoo.

19:38.905 --> 19:40.404
I lost a lot of cash.

19:40.406 --> 19:41.605
I lost a hundred bucks.

19:41.607 --> 19:42.569
Hmm.

19:43.041 --> 19:44.874
Well, so... so keep the kids together?

19:44.876 --> 19:46.142
- Mm-hmm.
- Interesting.

19:46.144 --> 19:47.677
Yeah, it's a little unorthodox,

19:47.679 --> 19:49.012
but that's actually really smart.

19:49.014 --> 19:50.480
Oh, it's actually really smart?

19:50.482 --> 19:51.681
Wow, thank you for believing in us.

19:51.683 --> 19:52.815
Okay, all right, all right.

19:52.817 --> 19:54.751
Come on, that's not what I meant.

19:54.753 --> 19:55.985
We've all read a book, just
want to put that out there.

19:55.987 --> 19:57.487
- Even Michelle.
- Yep.

19:57.489 --> 19:58.955
That's enough. I gotta get to my class.

19:58.957 --> 20:00.423
Thank you very much. I appreciate it.

20:00.425 --> 20:03.159
- You're welcome.
- Be careful.

20:04.044 --> 20:06.038
Gonna give him one more minute.

20:06.665 --> 20:08.631
He'll be here or else.

20:08.631 --> 20:10.197
Or else what?

20:10.862 --> 20:12.328
I don't know.

20:12.330 --> 20:14.797
All right, come on. Get in there, you.

20:14.799 --> 20:16.290
Go, go.

20:17.267 --> 20:19.601
Hey, everybody. What's up, Ralph?

20:19.921 --> 20:22.905
This is Dan Decker. I'm
adding him to AP Bio.

20:23.180 --> 20:24.707
- I don't wanna be...
- Shut up!

20:24.709 --> 20:27.043
Go sit next to Devin, go.
You, can you...

20:27.045 --> 20:29.278
Yeah, thanks. Go, scoot.

20:29.280 --> 20:31.214
Does his guidance
counselor know about this?

20:31.216 --> 20:32.713
You're not the boss of me.

20:33.790 --> 20:35.551
That's literally my job description.

20:39.365 --> 20:40.756
All right, listen up.

20:40.759 --> 20:42.692
Some things are gonna
change around here big time.

20:42.694 --> 20:44.093
None of you guys are
gonna pick on each other

20:44.095 --> 20:45.597
or I'll kick your ass.

20:45.597 --> 20:47.530
I will literally beat you
up with my adult muscles.

20:47.778 --> 20:49.511
And if I go and do something dumb,

20:49.513 --> 20:51.246
that doesn't mean you
can go and do it too.

20:51.248 --> 20:52.769
Now let me hear you say that back.

20:53.050 --> 20:54.883
We can't pick on each other

20:54.885 --> 20:57.886
or else you'll beat us up
with your adult muscles and...

21:02.559 --> 21:05.827
...just because you do
something dumb doesn't mean...
