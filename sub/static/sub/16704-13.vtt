00:21.145 --> 00:22.945
Bob's Burgers!
Fresh ground meat!

00:23.023 --> 00:24.153
Great atmosphere!

00:25.764 --> 00:27.064
Gene, bring it in.

00:27.139 --> 00:28.259
Get out of that burger suit.

00:28.314 --> 00:29.614
We're going.

00:29.689 --> 00:31.119
Baseball waits for no one.

00:31.195 --> 00:32.025
It smells like urine.

00:32.098 --> 00:33.768
Did you pee in that?

00:33.835 --> 00:35.975
I had to go!
I told you not to pee in it

00:36.054 --> 00:37.284
after I cleaned up from the...

00:37.359 --> 00:38.859
I'm the only one who wears it.

00:38.935 --> 00:40.070
What's the difference?
Oh, my God.

00:40.100 --> 00:41.459
What, you don't want
to buy burgers

00:41.489 --> 00:42.875
from a guy who smells like pee?

00:42.951 --> 00:44.651
No one can place
where it's coming from.

00:44.728 --> 00:46.408
I can't believe you'll close
the restaurant

00:46.439 --> 00:47.865
to go to a baseball game.

00:47.941 --> 00:49.180
Louise, this isn't just a game.

00:49.210 --> 00:50.916
We bought an ad at the ballpark.

00:50.993 --> 00:52.453
That's worth closing for, right?

00:52.529 --> 00:54.199
Oh, can't wait to see it!

00:54.276 --> 00:56.336
It's gonna be so
exciting. We're famous.

00:56.414 --> 00:59.214
It looks like a hot dog
wrapper's stuck in the net.

00:59.296 --> 01:01.466
Like, a really tiny hot dog.

01:01.544 --> 01:03.274
I did think it was gonna be
a little bigger.

01:03.351 --> 01:04.921
I think more people
would see your ad

01:04.988 --> 01:07.028
if it was a urinal cake.
Are you kidding?

01:07.106 --> 01:09.066
I wish I could afford
a urinal cake ad.

01:09.144 --> 01:11.044
All this talk about cake
is making me hungry.

01:11.122 --> 01:13.892
I'm gonna flag down
the ice cream sandwich guy. Hey!

01:13.973 --> 01:15.933
Play ball!

01:16.011 --> 01:19.181
Welcome to opening day
of minor league baseball.

01:19.264 --> 01:22.834
Let's hear it for your
Wonder Wharf Wonderdogs!

01:22.908 --> 01:25.878
Please give a big Wonderdog
welcome to Phe-Nom,

01:25.960 --> 01:29.500
the Korean bunt specialist!

01:29.575 --> 01:31.615
I never realised baseball
had so much butt-touching.

01:31.647 --> 01:33.293
That's how they
communicate, Tina.

01:33.360 --> 01:35.300
It's like Braille,
but with butts.

01:35.368 --> 01:36.978
Read this!

01:38.088 --> 01:40.258
I'm bored.

01:40.327 --> 01:42.067
Boredom. Boring sports.

01:42.144 --> 01:43.624
Hey, it's the seventh-
inning stretch.

01:43.654 --> 01:45.050
Time for the mascot race.

01:45.116 --> 01:46.686
Well, hello!

01:46.762 --> 01:49.392
Please welcome the owner
of the Wonderdogs,

01:49.473 --> 01:51.513
Mr. Calvin Fischoeder!

01:51.581 --> 01:52.281
Fish!

01:52.354 --> 01:53.724
It's that time.

01:53.800 --> 01:56.030
Now cheer
for your favourite mascot!

01:56.109 --> 01:57.709
Mr. Fischoeder
owns the team?

01:57.786 --> 01:59.686
He owns the ballpark, the team,
Wonder Wharf.

01:59.764 --> 02:01.494
I'm gonna marry that man.

02:01.571 --> 02:04.001
No, you're not.
I wanna be rich!

02:04.081 --> 02:05.251
Don't be frightened.

02:05.315 --> 02:06.685
I have a gun!

02:06.761 --> 02:08.261
So, get set...

02:10.405 --> 02:12.515
Where has this sport been
all my life?

02:12.584 --> 02:15.454
You know, I wear the burger
costume all the time.

02:15.536 --> 02:17.536
Maybe I could race
in one of these races, Dad.

02:17.614 --> 02:19.134
I bet it's impossible to get in, Gene.

02:19.164 --> 02:21.190
I'm sure you got to know someone.
You do.

02:21.268 --> 02:22.068
It's Mr. Fischoeder,
our landlord.

02:22.132 --> 02:23.372
The winner!

02:23.437 --> 02:25.277
Well, I can't ask
a flavor of a guy

02:25.354 --> 02:26.814
I've never paid rent on time to.

02:26.890 --> 02:28.520
You're his son, Gene.
He'll ask him.

02:28.597 --> 02:29.637
Yay!
No, I won't.

02:29.701 --> 02:31.641
Now taking the mound to pitch,

02:31.719 --> 02:33.079
former major league sensation,

02:33.155 --> 02:34.385
Torpedo Jones!

02:34.460 --> 02:36.400
That can't be the same Torpe...

02:36.468 --> 02:38.368
Kids, that's the Torpedo Jones!

02:38.446 --> 02:39.846
I can't believe
he's still playing.

02:39.922 --> 02:41.892
God, he, he must be...
my age.

02:41.970 --> 02:44.200
I speak for everyone here
when I say

02:44.279 --> 02:46.449
I don't know
what a Torpedo Jones is.

02:46.518 --> 02:48.288
Let me tell you, nobody...
We don't care.

02:48.365 --> 02:49.995
Gene, let me finish.
Nobody...

02:50.072 --> 02:51.672
That's what I was
trying to prevent.

02:51.748 --> 02:53.348
Nobody pitched like Torpedo.

02:53.425 --> 02:56.395
I was there for his
"The Pitch!"

02:56.467 --> 02:59.367
It was 15 years ago, but I
remember it like it was ten.

02:59.448 --> 03:03.548
His pitch was
the split-finger skadootch.

03:03.635 --> 03:05.675
Torpedo clinched the pennant
for us with that pitch.

03:05.713 --> 03:08.613
If he's so good, why have
we never heard of this guy?

03:08.695 --> 03:10.535
Well, because he didn't last
long in the bigs.

03:10.602 --> 03:12.772
You know, the skadootch is
just one of those pitches.

03:12.851 --> 03:14.611
When it was on,
it was really on.

03:14.688 --> 03:17.488
But when it wasn't...

03:17.570 --> 03:20.740
it's like hitting candy out of
a baby's hand... with a bat.

03:20.823 --> 03:21.953
Wait. You mean
it's hard

03:22.027 --> 03:23.347
because babies hands
are so small?

03:23.423 --> 03:24.423
No, it's easy because...

03:24.467 --> 03:25.907
How could you hit a baby?

03:25.983 --> 03:28.253
Nobody would hit a baby's hand
with a bat in real life.

03:28.322 --> 03:30.122
I don't understand.
Was he fired from the bigs

03:30.200 --> 03:31.730
'cause he hit a baby with a bat?

03:31.806 --> 03:33.566
I'm not interested in
talking to you anymore.

03:35.591 --> 03:37.661
Sorry, Gene.
I don't see Fischoeder anywhere.

03:37.739 --> 03:38.899
Let's get going.

03:38.974 --> 03:40.844
That's all right.
I only wanted

03:40.922 --> 03:42.692
to do it really, really bad.
Oh!

03:42.759 --> 03:44.159
There's Torpedo!

03:44.235 --> 03:45.865
Dad, ask Torpedo
about the mascot races.

03:45.942 --> 03:47.142
Maybe he can get Gene in.

03:47.217 --> 03:48.987
Yeah!
Kids, come on.

03:49.054 --> 03:51.094
I can't bother Torpedo.
He's, like, my role model.

03:51.172 --> 03:54.702
Oh, that's creepy. Your role
model is the same age as you?

03:54.786 --> 03:57.956
I would never have another
nine-year-old as my role model.

03:58.039 --> 04:00.169
Hey, Torpedo!
My dad is a huge scout

04:00.248 --> 04:03.748
for the Baseball League
of America!

04:03.832 --> 04:07.002
Kidding. But he has
a flavor to ask you.

04:07.075 --> 04:09.285
Hi, I'm a huge fan.

04:09.354 --> 04:11.224
You know, I was there
for "The Pitch."

04:11.301 --> 04:13.101
So, uh, what can I do for ya?

04:13.179 --> 04:15.809
Picture? Autograph?
Three bucks each, both for five.

04:15.889 --> 04:17.918
Uh, yeah, both would be great.

04:17.998 --> 04:19.398
Dad!

04:19.474 --> 04:22.304
Oh, and my kid wants
to run in the mascot race.

04:22.385 --> 04:23.855
You don't think...
Hey, Russell!

04:23.931 --> 04:25.331
Some kid here wants to run

04:25.407 --> 04:27.707
in a mascot race.

04:27.776 --> 04:29.346
For you, Torpedo,
I'll make it happen.

04:29.423 --> 04:31.123
I got to free up one
of these outfits.

04:31.200 --> 04:32.700
No, you don't!
I got my own.

04:32.776 --> 04:33.836
It's a burger.

04:33.910 --> 04:35.840
Easy enough.
Thanks a lot, Torpedo.

04:35.918 --> 04:37.248
Good luck out there, sport.

04:37.324 --> 04:39.024
Linda, did you,
did you hear that?

04:39.101 --> 04:40.841
Torpedo Jones
called me "sport."

04:40.908 --> 04:43.048
He didn't call you "sport,"
he called Gene "sport."

04:43.127 --> 04:45.187
No, he was looking right at me.

04:45.265 --> 04:48.005
Yeah, he called me "sport"
and he tussled my hair.

04:48.076 --> 04:49.976
It was great, Gene.
You were great.

04:50.054 --> 04:51.484
I'm a great tussle receiver.

04:51.560 --> 04:54.200
Wow, wearing the burger suit
in the mascot race, Gene.

04:54.281 --> 04:55.441
That's advertising, huh?

04:55.515 --> 04:56.915
Don't touch me!

05:00.023 --> 05:02.723
It was so nice of Torpedo
to give us these seats

05:02.804 --> 05:04.664
so we can watch Gene's race.

05:04.742 --> 05:07.212
You can really make out
the players' tattoos from here.

05:07.292 --> 05:08.592
Makes you wonder about

05:08.657 --> 05:09.797
the tattoos we can't see.

05:09.872 --> 05:11.102
On their butts.

05:11.177 --> 05:12.907
How you doing, Gene?
You feeling fast?

05:12.984 --> 05:14.984
No, I feel queasy.

05:15.062 --> 05:16.662
Got some butterflies, Ace?

05:16.729 --> 05:18.799
Torpedo!
Want my advice, kid?

05:18.877 --> 05:22.147
It's a mascot race; All you
got to do is stay on your feet.

05:22.231 --> 05:24.261
Let the other guys
trip over themselves.

05:24.339 --> 05:27.339
It's time for the mascot race!

05:27.421 --> 05:29.721
Whoo-ee!
Goodie.

05:29.800 --> 05:31.870
Remember, you're an ambassador
for our restaurant,

05:31.939 --> 05:34.939
so just Y Y and run well,
'cause you don't run well.

05:35.021 --> 05:36.561
Good luck out there, sport.

05:36.627 --> 05:38.773
Oh. Yeah, I thought earlier
you called me "sport," so...

05:38.806 --> 05:40.125
Nah, that was,
that was a nickname

05:40.155 --> 05:41.881
for the kid there, Flash.
I'll take Flash.

05:41.958 --> 05:43.558
Kids, call me Flash from now on.

05:43.635 --> 05:45.465
Let's split the diff
and call you Stinky.

05:45.542 --> 05:47.472
Stinky! I like it!

05:47.550 --> 05:49.350
Oh, Torpedo,
here's a little thank you

05:49.428 --> 05:51.228
for getting Gene in the race.

05:51.305 --> 05:53.075
I make burgers for a living,

05:53.142 --> 05:55.142
so it's not weird
for me to give you this.

05:55.220 --> 05:56.890
I don't think
it's weird at all, Bob.

05:56.967 --> 05:58.267
Like a good burger.

05:58.333 --> 05:59.973
Mmm. That's a good burger.

06:00.049 --> 06:02.009
Finish this guy
back on the mound.

06:02.087 --> 06:05.387
Ha! Torpedo Jones just said
I make a good burger!

06:05.471 --> 06:07.541
I want that on my tombstone.
Seriously, okay?

06:07.619 --> 06:10.079
No, I already got your
tombstone picked out for ya.

06:10.159 --> 06:12.099
What, what is it?
It says, "Order up."

06:12.167 --> 06:13.337
That's good.

06:13.412 --> 06:14.642
Let's go with that one.

06:14.717 --> 06:17.217
Joining your Wonder Wharf
mascots today is

06:17.297 --> 06:18.467
a special guest food,

06:18.532 --> 06:19.672
a burger!

06:19.737 --> 06:21.107
A boy who is also a burger.

06:21.183 --> 06:23.253
And I have my gun.

06:23.321 --> 06:25.531
Ready, set...

06:27.548 --> 06:29.118
Go get 'em, Gene!

06:29.184 --> 06:31.524
I reinforced the crotch
so he wouldn't tear it.

06:31.604 --> 06:34.834
Win, Gene!
Avenge Dad's death!

06:34.917 --> 06:37.387
Down goes Sammy Sea Lion!

06:39.776 --> 06:41.736
Ooh! It's
a two-mascot race!

06:41.814 --> 06:44.014
Burger and Captain Pel I. Can.

06:44.093 --> 06:45.093
There they go,

06:45.127 --> 06:46.997
like two, fast, fiery...

06:47.075 --> 06:48.445
bew...!

06:51.492 --> 06:54.262
The burger is your winner!

06:56.251 --> 06:57.650
Well, congratulations,
young burger.

06:57.680 --> 06:59.196
Ladies and gentlemen,

06:59.263 --> 07:01.533
you can purchase delicious
burgers that look somewhat

07:01.612 --> 07:03.712
like him right here at the park.

07:03.790 --> 07:06.720
And at my family's restaurant.

07:06.802 --> 07:08.542
And, uh, what's the name
of that restaurant?

07:08.609 --> 07:10.479
Ah... it's, it's...

07:10.557 --> 07:11.727
Bob's Burgers!

07:11.792 --> 07:13.432
God, I'm there every day.

07:13.499 --> 07:14.739
Bob's Burgers!

07:14.804 --> 07:16.244
It's... Oh, God...
Gene! No!

07:16.320 --> 07:17.719
Never mind. Never mind.
That's okay.

07:17.749 --> 07:19.025
Bob's Burgers!
Oh, my God!

07:19.101 --> 07:21.301
You can get everything you
expect from a burger

07:21.370 --> 07:23.090
at whatever the name
of his restaurant is...

07:23.167 --> 07:24.927
Oh, oh, I just remembered!
I just remembered!

07:24.958 --> 07:26.094
It's too late.

07:26.168 --> 07:28.398
But you can get them
here at the park, today.

07:28.478 --> 07:29.808
No! Say it!

07:29.883 --> 07:32.783
I won something! I won!
I won! I won something!

07:32.865 --> 07:35.095
Yeah, and you didn't fall
down like everyone else.

07:35.174 --> 07:36.804
Tell that to your grandkids.
I will.

07:36.881 --> 07:38.481
Gene, are you kidding me?!

07:38.557 --> 07:40.957
The name of the restaurant is
Bob's Burgers!

07:41.037 --> 07:42.907
Well, I call you Dad!

07:42.985 --> 07:45.115
I think of it as Dad's Burgers!

07:45.193 --> 07:47.693
You live above it!
You work in it every day!

07:47.773 --> 07:49.373
Bob, calm down.
Calm down. Calm down.

07:49.440 --> 07:50.880
I'm sorry, Dad.

07:50.956 --> 07:52.456
I'm fine. I'm fine.
He did great.

07:52.522 --> 07:53.822
You did great, Gene.

07:53.898 --> 07:55.938
A gold medal! Oh, we
should get that bronzed!

07:57.482 --> 07:59.522
Strike three.
You're out!

07:59.590 --> 08:02.830
Torpedo's split-finger skadootch
has suddenly started clicking.

08:02.913 --> 08:05.113
I love that burger
of yours, Bob.

08:05.182 --> 08:08.622
Hey, after the game,
let's all go to Bob's Burgers!

08:08.706 --> 08:10.606
Whoo!

08:10.684 --> 08:13.714
Now that's advertising, huh?

08:19.860 --> 08:21.690
Ooh, Angel!

08:21.767 --> 08:24.107
Do they call you that 'cause
you're such a good boy?

08:24.177 --> 08:27.087
I did many bad things
to escape Cuba.

08:27.158 --> 08:29.498
Things that haunt me
in the dark of the night.

08:29.568 --> 08:30.708
Aw...

08:30.783 --> 08:32.043
How about another beer?

08:32.118 --> 08:34.788
Man, you kids got a great dad,
you know that?

08:34.828 --> 08:37.669
One wife. One family.
That's the way to do it.

08:37.750 --> 08:40.250
You know, in the majors,
most guys got a whole bunch

08:40.320 --> 08:42.090
of families spread out
over the 50 states.

08:42.168 --> 08:44.738
When spring training starts,
you get your Florida wife.

08:44.818 --> 08:47.078
When it's regular season,
it's open season, if you know

08:47.157 --> 08:48.897
what I'm talkin' about.

08:48.964 --> 08:50.844
You kiss your home field wife
and kids good-bye,

08:50.912 --> 08:52.512
you tell 'em you'll miss 'em,
and you do.

08:52.542 --> 08:54.218
But you still take some
of their toys

08:54.295 --> 08:55.825
and re-gift 'em
for your away kids.

08:55.902 --> 08:57.802
I bet you're a great dad.

08:57.879 --> 08:59.309
And three great husbands.

08:59.385 --> 09:01.285
Mr. Torpedo,
I couldn't help but notice

09:01.363 --> 09:04.233
that the tall boy was looking
a little lethargic.

09:04.305 --> 09:06.245
Yeah, he's got Lupus or rickets
or somethin'.

09:06.323 --> 09:09.353
I don't know why we keep giving
that job to these sick kids.

09:09.435 --> 09:12.035
I was wondering if I could offer
my services.

09:12.115 --> 09:14.145
I'm very healthy.

09:14.224 --> 09:17.164
Okay, okay, okay. Whoa, whoa.
Hey, you got the job.

09:17.236 --> 09:18.606
Just stop doing that.

09:18.681 --> 09:20.511
Here's your first
ball girl duty:

09:20.619 --> 09:22.859
Bringing me one of your dad's
burgers before every gam

09:22.928 --> 09:23.928
Okay.

09:25.478 --> 09:27.878
Here's the tobacco you wanted.

09:27.988 --> 09:29.958
And your comic books.

09:38.610 --> 09:40.240
Phe-Nom, is it possible

09:40.316 --> 09:43.256
to be in love
with 25 people at once?

09:43.328 --> 09:44.568
You're my favourite.

09:44.633 --> 09:46.843
Don't tell Angel.
He's fiery.

09:48.991 --> 09:51.261
Strike three!

09:51.340 --> 09:54.110
Sound the alarm
because Torpedo is on fire!

09:54.181 --> 09:57.591
Fire! Fire! Fire!

09:57.665 --> 10:00.305
Not a good idea, Burt.
It's a crowded stadium.

10:00.385 --> 10:01.585
That Torpedo is amazing!

10:01.650 --> 10:03.050
Has he always been this good?

10:03.126 --> 10:05.226
No, he hasn't been good
in a long time.

10:05.305 --> 10:07.445
He says my burgers have
helped him pitch better.

10:07.514 --> 10:09.414
How does a burger help
someone pitch better?

10:09.491 --> 10:11.161
Here ya go, Bob,
little souvenir.

10:11.238 --> 10:12.268
Thanks, buddy!

10:12.343 --> 10:14.973
Whoa, slippery.

10:15.053 --> 10:16.653
It's greasy, huh?

10:16.730 --> 10:18.560
What does this smell like?

10:18.637 --> 10:20.667
Hey, stop sniffing
Torpedo's balls.

10:20.746 --> 10:22.686
Get it?

10:22.754 --> 10:24.454
It's like you're
in love with him.

10:24.531 --> 10:26.731
Wait.
That's our burger.

10:26.809 --> 10:29.349
Oh, crap. Torpedo's putting
my grease on the ball.

10:29.420 --> 10:32.220
That's how his skadootch
is skadootching so much.

10:32.301 --> 10:35.271
Your hero's using your burger
grease to win. That's great!

10:35.353 --> 10:38.583
No, Lin, Torpedo is using
my burger grease to cheat.

10:40.212 --> 10:41.542
Oh.

10:44.901 --> 10:46.571
So you helped Torpedo cheat.

10:46.638 --> 10:48.238
If that means the Wonderdogs
keep coming

10:48.314 --> 10:49.584
to the restaurant

10:49.659 --> 10:51.419
bringing all sorts of business
with them,

10:51.497 --> 10:54.697
I say big whoop, let the old man
throw a greasy skadootch.

10:54.780 --> 10:56.380
Strike two!

10:56.456 --> 10:58.426
I don't even know
what to think about this.

10:58.494 --> 10:59.864
I got to go take a leak.

10:59.940 --> 11:01.810
Oh, get me an ice cream
in a mini-helmet!

11:03.996 --> 11:05.396
Bob. You look glum.

11:05.462 --> 11:06.902
Oh, I, uh...

11:06.978 --> 11:10.608
You... don't hold
your... when you pee.

11:10.692 --> 11:12.422
Why? It's not
going anywhere.

11:12.499 --> 11:14.069
Okay.

11:14.146 --> 11:16.906
Um, well, what if you found
out that someone you knew

11:16.987 --> 11:18.657
was doing something sort of bad,

11:18.734 --> 11:20.894
and you were helping them
do that sort of bad thing...

11:20.973 --> 11:22.913
Is it me?
Is it abortions?

11:22.981 --> 11:25.081
Wait. What?
Uh, what were you saying?

11:25.159 --> 11:27.059
Torpedo Jones is
greasing the ball,

11:27.137 --> 11:28.877
and he's using my
grease to do it.

11:28.944 --> 11:30.284
Mm-mm.

11:30.350 --> 11:32.450
Oh. Come walk with me.

11:32.528 --> 11:35.598
Come behind the scenes!

11:35.681 --> 11:39.181
Torpedo's dazzling pitching
is putting more butts in seats

11:39.265 --> 11:41.135
than this stadium can handle.

11:41.202 --> 11:42.872
Is the roller coaster
going to be okay

11:42.949 --> 11:44.749
without those huge
planks of wood?

11:44.827 --> 11:46.627
Sure, sure!

11:46.704 --> 11:48.864
These people aren't paying
for extra wood, Bob.

11:48.943 --> 11:51.813
No one wants to ride
Extra Wood Mountain.

11:51.894 --> 11:53.894
Whoa! Watch out!
Extra nuts and bolts.

11:53.973 --> 11:55.603
Ow!

11:55.679 --> 11:57.039
People come to baseball games

11:57.115 --> 11:59.155
for the same reason they
come to the amusement park:

11:59.223 --> 12:01.163
To be entertained!

12:01.241 --> 12:03.741
Does it really matter if
the games are rigged? No!

12:03.821 --> 12:05.181
The games are rigged?
Yes!

12:05.257 --> 12:08.057
Oh. My wonderdog
is hanging out.

12:08.138 --> 12:09.838
Yes. Yes, it is.

12:09.915 --> 12:11.515
I got so caught up
in our conversation,

12:11.592 --> 12:12.792
I forgot to zip.

12:12.857 --> 12:14.257
Yeah, I didn't want
to say anything.

12:14.303 --> 12:15.733
Why not?
I, uh...

12:15.809 --> 12:17.579
Compliments are welcome.
Where was I?

12:17.646 --> 12:19.656
You were saying
the games are rigged.

12:19.724 --> 12:21.564
Yes. The games
are all rigged.

12:26.059 --> 12:28.689
I'm not letting my kids
play these games anymore.

12:28.770 --> 12:30.440
But look at these smiling faces.

12:30.516 --> 12:32.816
Just like those smiling faces.

12:32.896 --> 12:36.026
Smiling at every skadootch
the Torpedo throws.

12:36.108 --> 12:37.478
They don't want to know, Bob.

12:37.544 --> 12:39.684
They don't want to
look behind the curtain.

12:39.763 --> 12:41.063
I don't know.

12:41.128 --> 12:43.498
It just seems like
bad karma or something.

12:43.578 --> 12:46.778
Karma? There's no
such thing as karma.

12:46.861 --> 12:50.031
Not in this town.

12:50.104 --> 12:52.374
Oh, just kick 'em. Kick 'em
right into the ocean!

12:52.453 --> 12:54.223
Okay.
That's it.

12:56.238 --> 12:59.178
Wait, why does Tornado want
our old grease in a jar?

12:59.250 --> 13:00.820
It's Torpedo, Gene.
Oh.

13:00.896 --> 13:02.326
Uh, it helps him pitch better.

13:02.402 --> 13:04.002
And-And don't forget,
it's a secret.

13:04.079 --> 13:05.549
Why? Is it against
the rules?

13:05.615 --> 13:06.915
Technically, yes.

13:06.990 --> 13:08.490
So then it's cheating.

13:08.566 --> 13:11.296
No. What it is, is helping
people enjoy baseball more.

13:11.377 --> 13:12.877
It's entertainment.

13:12.954 --> 13:14.154
I'm confused.

13:14.229 --> 13:15.629
Are you and Mom
getting divorced?

13:15.704 --> 13:17.204
What?
Oh, my God, you are.

13:17.270 --> 13:18.570
I call Mom!
I call Dad!

13:18.646 --> 13:20.116
You guys took both of them.

13:20.192 --> 13:21.552
Enough. Go fill
the condiments.

13:21.628 --> 13:23.228
I call ketchup!
I call mustard!

13:23.304 --> 13:25.004
Aw...
You can do horseradish.

13:25.081 --> 13:26.241
There's not...
okay.

13:26.316 --> 13:27.486
Thanks, Bobby.

13:27.561 --> 13:28.961
Hey, who wants a burger?

13:29.027 --> 13:30.867
On the Torpedo!
Hooray!

13:32.711 --> 13:34.921
Gene, you're defending your
title. Are you nervous?

13:34.990 --> 13:36.630
Why don't you ask my diarrhoea.

13:36.707 --> 13:38.307
You should be nervous.

13:38.374 --> 13:40.644
You're a chubby kid
in a mascot suit.

13:40.723 --> 13:43.293
That's what I'm saying.
I should cheat.

13:43.373 --> 13:45.333
Dad says it's okay when
it's for entertainment.

13:45.411 --> 13:47.181
That's right! Let's cheat!

13:47.259 --> 13:48.457
- You see that pelican?
- Yeah.

13:48.487 --> 13:50.063
You're running, right?

13:50.130 --> 13:52.340
You have a switchblade
taped to your shoe.

13:52.409 --> 13:53.779
He does?
He will.

13:53.855 --> 13:55.685
And on your other shoe,
you'll have a lemon.

13:55.762 --> 13:57.292
Stab! Stab! Stab!

13:57.368 --> 13:58.538
Sting, sting, sting!

13:58.613 --> 14:00.273
"What are you doing?"

14:00.350 --> 14:02.250
"I'm squeezing lemon
into your wound!"

14:02.328 --> 14:04.328
Sweet baby blade foot.

14:04.406 --> 14:07.176
Or... I can give him a nudge
and tip him over.

14:07.247 --> 14:08.417
Ugh, really?

14:08.492 --> 14:09.922
Yeah. He's top-heavy.

14:09.998 --> 14:11.698
I'll just give him
a little tippity-tap.

14:11.775 --> 14:14.205
Well, I'm still gluing
a knife to my foot.

14:16.534 --> 14:18.134
Yay, Gene! Go, Gene!
That-a-way, son!

14:20.620 --> 14:22.220
Tippity-tap.

14:23.531 --> 14:24.561
Ooh!

14:24.636 --> 14:25.936
It's a three-mascot pileup!

14:26.011 --> 14:27.941
Go, Gene!
All right! Go!

14:28.019 --> 14:30.149
The Boy Burger wins again!

14:30.228 --> 14:31.968
How about that?

14:32.035 --> 14:33.475
Hey, how about this, Phil?

14:36.091 --> 14:38.221
I don't know, Burt.
I'm not so sure about that.

14:38.299 --> 14:39.299
Yay!

14:39.344 --> 14:40.904
I won! I won again!

14:40.980 --> 14:42.720
My brother won!

14:42.787 --> 14:44.257
Guys, take off your shirts.

14:46.612 --> 14:48.412
Good arm pumping, baby!

14:48.490 --> 14:50.150
That's how I disguised the push.

14:50.226 --> 14:52.426
What push?
He pushed the Cotton Candy mascot

14:52.505 --> 14:54.705
so he'd fall over.
Hooray for cheating!

14:54.784 --> 14:56.684
Gene, how could you?
You know that's wrong.

14:56.762 --> 14:58.962
Uh-uh.
Not when it's entertainment.

14:59.041 --> 15:00.471
You said it yourself.

15:00.547 --> 15:01.977
You told them cheating is okay?

15:02.053 --> 15:03.483
No, I didn't, Linda.

15:03.559 --> 15:05.029
Yes, he did.

15:05.105 --> 15:07.105
Oh, Bobby.
Oh, crap.

15:07.173 --> 15:09.543
Go get me a soft serve.
And make it a swirl!

15:14.171 --> 15:15.971
Look, Gene, when I said
it's okay to cheat,

15:16.048 --> 15:19.048
I meant for Torpedo, not for you
to cheat in your mascot race.

15:19.130 --> 15:21.010
You should really give
back one of those medals.

15:21.042 --> 15:22.438
Ooh, but I want to get a picture

15:22.514 --> 15:23.833
of you wearing them
before you do.

15:23.863 --> 15:25.789
I'm not giving back my medals!

15:25.857 --> 15:28.067
Those suckers got their
money's worth, Pops.

15:28.136 --> 15:29.676
I'm good for business, Dad.

15:29.742 --> 15:31.982
You know what? From now on,
there'll be no more cheating.

15:32.061 --> 15:34.131
Does that mean I shouldn't
give Torpedo this grease?

15:34.210 --> 15:36.140
That's right, Tina.
Yes.

15:36.207 --> 15:38.517
No more cheating for
anyone in this house.

15:38.587 --> 15:41.587
From now on, I won't wear
my tummy tuck jeans.

15:41.669 --> 15:44.609
And good-bye, Brazilian.
Hello, rain forest.

15:46.197 --> 15:47.627
Sorry, Dad.

15:47.703 --> 15:50.333
But if I win tomorrow,
I'll be the first mascot

15:50.413 --> 15:52.383
ever to win
three races in a row.

15:52.461 --> 15:53.561
I'm a top!

15:53.626 --> 15:54.896
You mean you're on top.

15:54.971 --> 15:57.301
No. I'm a top!

16:00.292 --> 16:02.162
Shew. I was starting
to think maybe you were

16:02.240 --> 16:03.740
going to leave me
high and dry here.

16:03.816 --> 16:05.676
Well, what's in this jar
is worth the wait.

16:05.754 --> 16:06.754
What the...?

16:06.798 --> 16:08.628
"You don't need to cheat.

16:08.705 --> 16:10.575
"You can win without me.

16:10.643 --> 16:12.583
"If you try your hardest,
you've already won.

16:12.661 --> 16:13.851
Love, Bob's grease."

16:13.926 --> 16:15.326
That's right, Torpedo.

16:15.402 --> 16:16.772
You can win without my grease.

16:16.847 --> 16:18.807
It just took me
believing in you.

16:18.885 --> 16:20.455
Now, listen.
Gene's about to race,

16:20.532 --> 16:21.892
and since you're his role model,

16:21.968 --> 16:23.398
I'm hoping you'll tell Gene

16:23.473 --> 16:25.473
he can win without cheating,
just like you.

16:25.552 --> 16:26.582
Who the hell's Gene?

16:26.656 --> 16:28.496
That's... my son.

16:28.564 --> 16:30.734
You're his role model,
and you're my role model, too.

16:30.812 --> 16:34.512
Wh...? I can't be your role
model; We're the same age.

16:34.597 --> 16:36.317
What's this mean?
You cutting me off, Bob-o?

16:36.348 --> 16:38.174
Torpedo, I'm cutting you free.

16:38.242 --> 16:40.012
Come here.
Wait, what are you going to do?

16:40.089 --> 16:42.159
I'm going to hug you.
Slow down there, tiger.

16:42.237 --> 16:44.997
Guess I'll have to make this
grease last the whole season.

16:45.079 --> 16:46.679
I should have never
given you my grease.

16:46.755 --> 16:48.125
I created a monster.

16:48.191 --> 16:49.761
You think you
started my greasing?

16:49.837 --> 16:52.067
I've always cheated, Bobby.

16:52.146 --> 16:53.946
Not the... "The Pitch."

16:54.024 --> 16:55.824
Oh, definitely "The Pitch."

16:55.901 --> 16:57.901
That game, I had a pat of

16:57.979 --> 16:59.979
butter in my nostril,
sex jelly in my armpit...

17:00.057 --> 17:01.557
Hell, I was on
prescription drugs

17:01.624 --> 17:03.894
to stimulate
production of earwax.

17:03.973 --> 17:05.903
And "The Pitch"?

17:05.981 --> 17:08.021
That was courtesy of some
black market whale blubber

17:08.053 --> 17:09.259
I bought off some Eskimos.

17:09.334 --> 17:11.634
Cute note, though, Bob.
Bit of advice:

17:11.713 --> 17:14.073
If you want a role model,
pick an old guy.

17:14.153 --> 17:17.923
By the time you
grow up, they're dead.

17:18.008 --> 17:19.738
Didn't go great.

17:19.815 --> 17:21.015
Gene!
I'm sure it was fine.

17:21.089 --> 17:23.060
Torpedo seems like
a reasonable guy.

17:23.127 --> 17:25.667
Torpedo Jones wants you
out of his seats this second.

17:25.749 --> 17:27.679
What a schmuck.
Gene!

17:27.757 --> 17:31.087
It's the seventh-inning stretch.

17:31.170 --> 17:32.400
Mascots are lining up.

17:32.475 --> 17:34.345
All right, maybe I have an idea.

17:34.423 --> 17:35.953
Hi, fellas.

17:36.029 --> 17:37.959
I'd love to say
a few words to my son,

17:38.037 --> 17:39.807
the burger, over the P.A.
Excuse me.

17:39.884 --> 17:42.144
Uh... okay.
Highly unusual.

17:42.223 --> 17:43.663
Doesn't matter.
None of this matters.

17:43.693 --> 17:44.769
Gene.

17:44.834 --> 17:45.974
BOB (over P.A.)
Up here.

17:46.049 --> 17:47.949
Jesus?

17:48.016 --> 17:49.816
No, Gene, it's your
father. I'm up here.

17:49.894 --> 17:51.294
You're dead?!

17:51.369 --> 17:53.099
Yes.

17:53.177 --> 17:55.177
No, I'm-I'm kidding.

17:55.255 --> 17:58.125
I'm up here in the booth.
Right here. See me?

17:58.206 --> 18:00.406
Boy, this microphone smells like beer.

18:00.475 --> 18:03.215
Well, let's just say AA
was "A" waste of time.

18:03.296 --> 18:05.196
Winning isn't everything, Gene.

18:05.274 --> 18:07.904
Yes, we're all here to be
entertained, but if you, um,

18:07.985 --> 18:11.015
cut corners now, the next
thing you know, you'll be

18:11.097 --> 18:13.467
hiding lard in your nose

18:13.547 --> 18:15.917
or taking wood
out of roller coasters.

18:15.986 --> 18:17.786
Hey, all right,
that's enough of that.

18:17.864 --> 18:19.934
Let's start the race!

18:20.012 --> 18:21.312
I'm trying to talk to my son.

18:21.378 --> 18:23.088
Gene, run clean.

18:23.155 --> 18:24.355
On your mark!

18:24.430 --> 18:25.669
Gene, what are you going to do?

18:25.699 --> 18:26.475
I don't know.

18:26.538 --> 18:28.038
You're going to cheat!

18:28.114 --> 18:29.354
That's what you're going to do!

18:29.419 --> 18:30.699
You're going to win by cheating!

18:36.286 --> 18:38.126
Who wants to see the burger
win three in a row?

18:39.639 --> 18:41.439
Gene, listen to me.
You know what to do.

18:41.517 --> 18:44.077
Bob... triple crown for burger.

18:44.157 --> 18:45.727
Good for your business.

18:45.804 --> 18:46.734
See?!

18:46.808 --> 18:48.278
No, Gene!

18:48.344 --> 18:50.114
Don't worry about
the advertising.

18:50.191 --> 18:51.911
What are you doing?
It's a starter's pistol.

18:51.988 --> 18:53.428
It's a real gun.
You should get down.

18:53.458 --> 18:54.404
What?!

18:54.478 --> 18:56.208
Stop shooting!
This is crazy.

18:56.285 --> 18:57.755
Oh, good. He stopped.

18:57.831 --> 18:59.531
He's just out of bullets.

18:59.598 --> 19:00.676
And down goes Cotton Candy!

19:00.706 --> 19:02.112
It's a two-mascot race.

19:02.178 --> 19:04.218
Gene. Do the right thing.

19:04.286 --> 19:06.296
Yeah. You can win
on your own, Gene!

19:06.365 --> 19:07.365
Probably.

19:08.583 --> 19:10.083
Hey...

19:13.272 --> 19:15.872
All right. Fine.

19:15.952 --> 19:17.812
Whoa, whoa!

19:17.890 --> 19:20.390
Don't push him! He was
going to push you!

19:20.470 --> 19:23.110
Congratulations to Captain Pel I. Can!

19:23.181 --> 19:24.851
Oh, Gene. Sorry, buddy.

19:24.928 --> 19:27.428
I mean, looks like
karma caught up to you.

19:27.508 --> 19:30.238
Bob, I told you there's
no such thing as karma.

19:30.319 --> 19:31.849
Uh, yes there is.

19:31.925 --> 19:33.555
No, I'm afraid there isn't!

19:33.632 --> 19:35.602
I'm afraid there is.
Is not.

19:47.667 --> 19:51.007
Oh, crap.

19:51.081 --> 19:54.351
See, Gene. This is what
happens when you cheat.

19:54.434 --> 19:55.804
That was incredible!

19:55.880 --> 19:57.410
Cheating is amazing!

19:57.486 --> 19:58.546
Oh.

19:58.620 --> 19:59.760
Bob?

19:59.825 --> 20:01.625
Oh. Uh, hi.

20:01.703 --> 20:03.743
Sorry about your roller coaster.

20:03.811 --> 20:06.111
Ah, roller coasters come and go.

20:06.190 --> 20:08.560
But Bobs are once in a lifetime.

20:08.640 --> 20:10.170
I admire you.

20:10.246 --> 20:12.446
You do?
You remind me of my father.

20:12.525 --> 20:14.595
He was honest,
and he worked hard.

20:14.664 --> 20:15.804
You an immigrant, Bob?

20:15.878 --> 20:17.208
Um... no.

20:17.284 --> 20:19.144
Just swarthy?
I guess.

20:19.221 --> 20:21.561
What's "swarthy"?
Um, dark and hairy.

20:21.631 --> 20:23.971
That's you!
And me in the future.

20:24.050 --> 20:26.550
Well, unlike you,
my father made a fortune.

20:26.631 --> 20:29.191
But in many other ways,
you guys are the same.

20:29.271 --> 20:32.141
Two decent, swarthy
peas in a pod.

20:32.223 --> 20:34.183
One rich and one...

20:34.261 --> 20:36.731
just scraping by.
Thanks.

20:36.811 --> 20:38.911
Well, we're off
to get a massage.

20:38.989 --> 20:41.249
Come on, Wonderdog.
Down, boy.

20:41.328 --> 20:43.828
He's gone, Dad.
My future husband's gone.

20:43.909 --> 20:45.679
You drove him away!

20:45.756 --> 20:47.056
Tina, what you got there?

20:47.121 --> 20:48.831
The team signed a ball

20:48.898 --> 20:50.538
so I'd have something
to remember them by.

20:50.569 --> 20:52.145
And I took this jockstrap.

20:52.211 --> 20:54.381
Okay, sweetie.

20:54.460 --> 20:56.060
Let's throw that in the wash.
No.

20:56.137 --> 20:57.637
Come on, give it to me.
Mm-mm.

20:57.713 --> 20:59.313
Do you know how many
venereal diseases

20:59.390 --> 21:00.690
those baseball players have?

21:00.755 --> 21:01.995
I don't care.

21:02.070 --> 21:03.230
Whose was it?

21:03.305 --> 21:04.935
Smells like Angel.
Angel.

21:05.012 --> 21:07.452
But don't tell Phe-Nom.
