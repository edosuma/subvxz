WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:01.293
Previously on The Originals...

00:01.293 --> 00:03.387
A thousand years ago, we three made

00:03.390 --> 00:05.571
an eternal vow. Always and forever.

00:05.574 --> 00:07.813
- That vow now includes my daughter.
- Hope's gone.

00:07.814 --> 00:09.007
She's the Hollow now.

00:09.010 --> 00:10.470
You said there was a way to save her.

00:10.472 --> 00:12.312
There is. When the Hollow was killed,

00:12.315 --> 00:15.145
they divided her remains.
Four bones, four volunteers,

00:15.148 --> 00:16.350
four different locations.

00:16.352 --> 00:18.218
That's how we're going
to beat the Hollow now.

00:18.220 --> 00:20.640
Transfer the Hollow's power
into four immortal vampires.

00:20.643 --> 00:22.421
And you have to go your separate ways,

00:22.424 --> 00:25.164
and you have to stay separate.
Can never see each other again.

00:25.167 --> 00:26.754
Can never go near each other again.

00:26.757 --> 00:29.254
This is gonna be tbe end
of always and forever.

00:29.257 --> 00:32.031
Well, if it'll save my little
girl, then we will make it so.

00:32.034 --> 00:34.134
When this spell is
over, you got to get away

00:34.136 --> 00:35.703
from each other, and
you have to stay away.

00:35.705 --> 00:37.554
I can hear it whispering.

00:37.557 --> 00:39.390
Caroline and I have built a school.

00:39.393 --> 00:41.559
It's a place for kids
with supernatural leanings,

00:41.562 --> 00:42.609
just like Hope.

00:42.611 --> 00:44.473
I think this is what
she's always wanted.

00:44.476 --> 00:46.004
Friends her own age.

00:46.007 --> 00:47.367
A normal life.

00:48.484 --> 00:49.950
My disease has always been

00:49.952 --> 00:51.718
blind devotion to my brother

00:51.720 --> 00:53.263
The Hollow's too
powerful. It's gonna tempt

00:53.265 --> 00:54.721
him to try to get
back with his siblings.

00:54.723 --> 00:55.687
Compel me.

00:55.690 --> 00:58.156
We can wipe out
centuries of family drama.

00:58.159 --> 00:59.872
The promise of always and forever.

00:59.875 --> 01:01.094
Forget it.

01:04.340 --> 01:05.640
Your vow.

01:05.643 --> 01:08.043
Let it go.

01:09.007 --> 01:11.881
_

01:12.335 --> 01:14.341
In all my travels,

01:14.343 --> 01:16.743
France never disappoints.

01:16.745 --> 01:20.080
Now I find I'm physically
drawn to the place,

01:20.082 --> 01:23.917
as if locked in an orbit
I'm helpless to alter.

01:23.920 --> 01:27.557
I suppose we're all satellites

01:27.560 --> 01:30.057
orbiting those we love.

01:30.059 --> 01:34.061
Recently, though, I'm
left to orbit from afar,

01:34.063 --> 01:35.662
and to pass the time

01:35.664 --> 01:37.479
by dropping in on old acquaintances.

01:37.482 --> 01:39.448
Entres nous, in 1928,

01:39.451 --> 01:43.169
the Gatineaux family and
I had a little falling out.

01:43.172 --> 01:45.772
I'd really like to put that to rest.

01:45.774 --> 01:48.742
So if you'll just... stand aside?

01:50.980 --> 01:52.412
You must've heard of me.

01:52.414 --> 01:54.147
Klaus le Fou?

01:54.149 --> 01:56.049
Klaus le Dement?

01:56.051 --> 01:58.652
Niklaus der Morder?

01:58.654 --> 02:00.287
No?

02:00.289 --> 02:02.556
Nothing?

02:04.000 --> 02:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:12.868 --> 02:15.631
I myself prefer Klaus the Mad.

02:17.339 --> 02:19.217
Do spread the word.

02:44.433 --> 02:46.366
Hey. You have the money?

02:50.076 --> 02:52.497
I'm not gonna ask where you got this.

02:53.951 --> 02:55.709
Remember, one now,

02:55.711 --> 02:57.170
one after.

03:00.232 --> 03:02.115
You sure about this, Henry?

03:03.428 --> 03:04.885
Yes.

03:06.188 --> 03:07.854
Do me a favor.

03:07.856 --> 03:09.456
Be discreet.

03:19.301 --> 03:21.815
It's me. Leave a message.

03:23.605 --> 03:25.939
Hey, Lisina.

03:25.941 --> 03:28.742
You're gonna get a call later.

03:28.744 --> 03:30.310
I just want you to know

03:30.312 --> 03:32.546
that there's nothing you could've done.

03:51.467 --> 03:53.274
Come in.

03:55.904 --> 03:57.971
Mr. Williams. What's up?

03:57.973 --> 03:59.840
Mr. Saltzman wants to see you.

03:59.842 --> 04:01.641
It's about Henry Benoit.

04:04.040 --> 04:07.647
Is, um, Mr. Saltzman calling my mom?

04:07.649 --> 04:10.490
That, and he thinks your dad

04:10.493 --> 04:12.152
should know what you've been up to.

04:13.622 --> 04:15.555
Yeah. Good luck finding him.

04:15.557 --> 04:16.923
Pack your bags, Hope.

04:16.925 --> 04:18.458
You're going home.

04:38.514 --> 04:40.497
Okay, guys.

04:40.500 --> 04:42.834
If these don't prep your liver

04:42.837 --> 04:44.595
for Mardi Gras, then nothing will.

04:44.598 --> 04:46.974
Eh, my liver was probably
dead before I became a vampire,

04:46.977 --> 04:48.722
but thanks, Poppy.

04:51.160 --> 04:54.294
Okay. So we should probably
get back to Mardi Gras prep.

04:54.296 --> 04:56.363
Oh, come on, Vincent, we got this.

04:56.365 --> 04:57.905
All right? It's gone
off without a hitch for,

04:57.907 --> 04:58.970
what, seven years now?

04:58.973 --> 05:01.577
Josh, that's because we haven't
taken it for granted in seven years.

05:01.579 --> 05:03.615
Let me remind you: moments of prosperity

05:03.618 --> 05:05.967
are invariably followed
by times of great pain,

05:05.970 --> 05:07.407
unless we remain vigilant.

05:07.409 --> 05:09.470
Thank you, Mr. Buzzkill.

05:09.473 --> 05:11.735
Okay, Freya, what you
got, Mardi Gras prep?

05:11.738 --> 05:13.712
The witches will be
working on their float

05:13.715 --> 05:14.881
in the City of the Dead.

05:14.884 --> 05:17.451
The werewolves in the Bayou.

05:17.453 --> 05:19.019
Josh?

05:19.021 --> 05:20.720
Yeah?

05:20.722 --> 05:22.889
Hmm? This is when you're supposed to say

05:22.892 --> 05:24.656
that the vampires are
gonna steer clear of both.

05:24.658 --> 05:27.460
Yeah. Uh, actually, maybe we should

05:27.463 --> 05:30.237
offer them some sort of incentive.

05:30.240 --> 05:33.700
Seven years of peace and
prosperity not enough?

05:33.702 --> 05:37.037
Well, it is, but we could
always use more daylight rings.

05:37.039 --> 05:38.738
Is this a negotiation, Josh?

05:42.311 --> 05:44.497
- Marcel.
- You know what?

05:44.500 --> 05:46.779
First of all, reading that
was very rude, and second...

05:46.782 --> 05:48.588
Josh, I don't know how
many times I have told you

05:48.590 --> 05:50.080
that what goes on in
this city is no longer

05:50.082 --> 05:51.697
any of Marcel Gerard's business.

05:51.700 --> 05:54.287
Okay? A-And, guys, this is
what I'm always talking about.

05:54.289 --> 05:56.983
Marcel means Rebekah.
Rebekah means Kol and Elijah.

05:56.986 --> 05:58.754
And I don't even want to
think about Klaus right now,

05:58.756 --> 06:00.323
'cause apparently, he has lost his mind.

06:00.325 --> 06:02.238
Oh, come on, we don't know
if those rumors are true.

06:02.240 --> 06:04.196
I know that we need to
make sure that they stay

06:04.199 --> 06:05.683
as far away from this city as possible.

06:05.685 --> 06:07.767
And Freya, I'll be Mr.
Buzzkill if it means

06:07.770 --> 06:09.416
reminding everybody here that the magic

06:09.419 --> 06:10.770
that those four carry inside of them,

06:10.772 --> 06:12.539
if we just put two of
them in the same place,

06:12.541 --> 06:13.540
it is a ticking bomb.

06:13.543 --> 06:15.007
Relax. Okay?

06:15.010 --> 06:17.344
Marcel's in New York. Elijah is...

06:19.794 --> 06:21.494
In Amnesia-land.

06:21.497 --> 06:24.837
Right, and Klaus is
wherever Klaus is these days.

06:24.840 --> 06:26.033
We're fine.

06:26.036 --> 06:28.989
Declan sent these over

06:28.991 --> 06:31.407
to tide you over until
your date tomorrow.

06:31.410 --> 06:32.809
Oh.

06:37.733 --> 06:39.904
Oh, my God, I swear, if
you don't marry that guy,

06:39.907 --> 06:40.873
I will.

06:40.876 --> 06:42.536
Baby steps.

06:42.538 --> 06:44.104
He's human.

06:44.106 --> 06:45.654
Life's complicated enough.

06:47.776 --> 06:50.610
Oh. Hope's school.

06:50.612 --> 06:52.312
Like I said.

06:53.541 --> 06:55.072
Hello?

06:57.553 --> 07:01.454
Fa-ray a-voh-lah-ray...

07:06.128 --> 07:08.001
Later, dude.

07:18.837 --> 07:20.807
You going somewhere?

07:20.809 --> 07:23.143
Home.

07:23.145 --> 07:27.547
I, uh, I got suspended.

07:28.984 --> 07:31.351
Hope Marshall got suspended?

07:35.220 --> 07:37.057
Cool.

07:54.025 --> 07:55.514
Sorry I got you in trouble.

07:55.517 --> 07:57.110
I said "be discreet."

07:57.112 --> 08:00.537
What part of jumping out
of a tower is discreet?

08:00.540 --> 08:02.716
I had to make sure it would work.

08:02.718 --> 08:05.061
If I only hurt myself,
then I would've just healed.

08:05.064 --> 08:08.788
Right. 'Cause no one's ever died
peacefully from sleeping pills.

08:08.790 --> 08:12.125
I'm not a person things go right for.

08:12.135 --> 08:15.203
You ever seen a werewolf with no
pecs who quotes E. E. Cummings?

08:17.299 --> 08:19.833
I can already tell I'm getting stronger.

08:19.835 --> 08:21.201
You know how good it will be

08:21.203 --> 08:23.003
not to have to take crap from anybody?

08:23.005 --> 08:25.275
What-what makes you think that?

08:25.278 --> 08:26.876
You're a hybrid now.

08:26.879 --> 08:29.074
You may be able to defend yourself,

08:29.077 --> 08:31.511
but they'll only hate
you for being different.

08:31.513 --> 08:36.049
I don't think that you
thought this through, Henry.

08:36.051 --> 08:38.018
You would not understand.

08:38.020 --> 08:39.626
Oh, really?

08:39.629 --> 08:42.789
Me? I wouldn't understand?

08:42.791 --> 08:44.791
That's different.

08:44.793 --> 08:47.761
None of the students know you're
Klaus Mikaelson's daughter.

08:47.764 --> 08:49.842
I don't know why Lisina told you.

08:49.845 --> 08:51.178
You and I aren't even friends.

08:51.181 --> 08:52.256
Your mom's our alpha.

08:52.259 --> 08:53.689
All the Crescent Wolves know.

08:53.692 --> 08:56.373
And so will everyone at
school when they start asking

08:56.376 --> 09:00.040
how you survived a swan dive
out of the memorial library.

09:03.431 --> 09:06.813
Your dad's not gonna kill me
for getting you suspended, is he?

09:06.815 --> 09:08.982
I wouldn't know.

09:08.984 --> 09:10.950
He can't bother to be a dad.

09:13.907 --> 09:15.621
I've never felt this way.

09:15.624 --> 09:18.329
I mean don't get me wrong,

09:18.332 --> 09:20.493
there are so many bad stories.

09:20.495 --> 09:23.076
But, I mean, every once in a while,

09:23.079 --> 09:26.533
you can make a tiny
difference to someone and...

09:26.535 --> 09:30.437
I guess that's why I became
a doctor in the first place.

09:30.439 --> 09:32.505
I want to kiss you so bad.

09:32.507 --> 09:34.626
Well, in five days, you can do...

09:36.378 --> 09:38.745
Crap. I lost you.

09:38.747 --> 09:40.313
Hang on.

09:40.315 --> 09:43.681
How's... that?

09:45.620 --> 09:47.454
That's perfect.

09:47.456 --> 09:49.889
Listen, um...

09:49.892 --> 09:54.161
the program asked me to
re-up for another cycle.

09:56.097 --> 09:58.397
- Another six months?
- Yeah.

09:58.400 --> 10:02.902
But I thought maybe you'd want
to come back with me this time.

10:02.904 --> 10:04.671
You'd love the people here,

10:04.673 --> 10:06.306
and Lebanon is so beautiful.

10:06.308 --> 10:07.884
Yeah, but you know

10:07.887 --> 10:09.765
I can't leave until I figure out

10:09.768 --> 10:11.467
how to get my family back together.

10:11.470 --> 10:13.780
And that is something that
you have not been able to do

10:13.782 --> 10:14.822
in seven years.

10:14.825 --> 10:17.451
Because I can't even try

10:17.454 --> 10:19.861
to neutralize the dark
magic that's inside of them

10:19.864 --> 10:21.397
unless they're in the same place.

10:21.400 --> 10:22.811
And if they're in the same place,

10:22.814 --> 10:24.944
that magic will find
its way back into Hope,

10:24.947 --> 10:28.264
and will probably destroy
her and them and the city,

10:28.267 --> 10:31.288
so, I don't know, you
know, it's... kind of hard.

10:31.291 --> 10:34.350
Yeah, but you don't
have to be in New Orleans

10:34.353 --> 10:36.202
to figure it out, right?

10:37.305 --> 10:39.172
Uh...

10:39.174 --> 10:41.141
I'll do you a deal.

10:41.143 --> 10:43.580
For every year that
you have spent on this,

10:43.583 --> 10:46.813
you spend a month in Lebanon with me.

10:57.425 --> 11:00.527
Marcel, enough with the suspense.

11:00.529 --> 11:02.128
It'll be worth it.

11:02.130 --> 11:03.327
Trust me.

11:05.734 --> 11:07.100
What is this?

11:07.102 --> 11:11.384
I call it "four objects and a question."

11:11.387 --> 11:13.884
First object.

11:15.673 --> 11:17.410
I remember that.

11:17.412 --> 11:20.680
And saying it was... hideous.

11:20.682 --> 11:23.666
Yes, but your eyes said "buy me,"

11:23.669 --> 11:25.702
so I went back later and did.

11:25.705 --> 11:26.937
Next.

11:30.458 --> 11:32.125
The house you designed.

11:32.127 --> 11:33.393
For you.

11:33.395 --> 11:34.994
For us.

11:34.997 --> 11:36.830
Now we can build it anywhere you like.

11:36.832 --> 11:38.387
Might not be quite up to code, but...

11:38.390 --> 11:39.966
It is beautiful.

11:41.269 --> 11:42.535
My sword.

11:42.537 --> 11:44.270
I told you when I was a child,

11:44.272 --> 11:45.720
I was gonna marry you one day.

11:45.723 --> 11:47.540
Right after our first duel, remember?

11:47.542 --> 11:51.311
And I said I would never marry
a man who couldn't best me.

11:51.313 --> 11:52.812
Now that's the thing.

11:52.814 --> 11:55.248
The last few years have
taught me something.

11:55.250 --> 11:56.683
I don't want to best you.

11:56.685 --> 11:59.652
I don't want to be ahead
of you or behind you.

11:59.654 --> 12:01.421
I want us side by side.

12:02.129 --> 12:04.657
And the moment that I realized that,

12:04.659 --> 12:06.226
I went in search

12:06.228 --> 12:07.760
of this.

12:07.763 --> 12:10.497
The fourth object.

12:13.134 --> 12:16.436
Which leads me to my question.

12:19.574 --> 12:21.374
Rebekah Mikaelson,

12:21.376 --> 12:23.009
delicate as lace,

12:23.011 --> 12:26.713
elegant as a fine home,

12:26.716 --> 12:29.250
tough as polished steel...

12:30.652 --> 12:32.819
and love of all my lives...

12:34.422 --> 12:36.089
will you marry me?

12:37.826 --> 12:39.392
Oh.

12:39.394 --> 12:42.295
I figured you'd be a mess by now, so...

12:42.297 --> 12:44.364
so I made this part simple.

12:46.001 --> 12:48.535
If you say...

12:48.538 --> 12:50.137
or if you say...

12:52.814 --> 12:55.668
Should be a pretty easy call.

12:57.646 --> 12:59.345
It should be.

13:01.509 --> 13:03.059
Except...

13:05.754 --> 13:07.739
Please don't say the family.

13:39.356 --> 13:41.454
Thank you.

13:41.456 --> 13:43.114
Thank you.

13:46.428 --> 13:48.027
An old favorite.

13:49.407 --> 13:53.129
Try as I might, I can't
resist a familiar refrain.

14:12.987 --> 14:15.154
I'm a sucker for Weill.

14:20.043 --> 14:22.477
You play with such finesse.

14:22.480 --> 14:24.132
Yeah, it keeps me out of trouble.

14:24.135 --> 14:26.109
Though Mahler's really more my style.

14:26.112 --> 14:28.045
Mahler?

14:28.047 --> 14:29.546
Guaranteed to clear any room.

14:29.548 --> 14:31.782
Well, then he and I
have something in common.

14:31.784 --> 14:33.150
And how is that?

14:33.152 --> 14:35.619
I have a bit of a temper.

14:35.621 --> 14:37.828
Interesting.

14:37.831 --> 14:39.923
See, I wouldn't be able
to tell by looking at you.

14:39.925 --> 14:42.726
Wouldn't you?

14:42.728 --> 14:44.528
And most people wouldn't
look so disappointed

14:44.530 --> 14:45.996
about that observation.

14:47.266 --> 14:50.267
Well, truth be told,
it's a balm to hear it.

14:50.269 --> 14:53.387
I've been feeling a
bit one-note recently.

14:53.390 --> 14:54.872
All work, you know?

14:54.874 --> 14:56.687
Modern conundrum, my friend.

14:56.690 --> 14:58.648
You work just to take
care of your family,

14:58.651 --> 15:00.770
then you don't have any
time to spend with them.

15:00.773 --> 15:02.846
My family is, uh...

15:02.848 --> 15:05.282
is geographically challenged.

15:05.284 --> 15:08.252
I've got a daughter I
haven't seen in seven years,

15:08.254 --> 15:10.053
haven't spoken to in five.

15:13.632 --> 15:15.732
There were some issues.

15:17.522 --> 15:20.289
This all sounds like
a recipe for regret.

15:22.279 --> 15:24.562
And now you sound like my brother.

15:28.690 --> 15:30.823
He was my lodestar.

15:36.461 --> 15:38.849
You're talking about
him in the past tense.

15:38.852 --> 15:42.336
He's been... away.

15:44.824 --> 15:47.825
I've only just realized
how far he's gone.

16:03.670 --> 16:06.004
You didn't say "yes."

16:06.007 --> 16:07.911
I didn't say "no."

16:07.913 --> 16:10.481
I'm sorry, but I just
knocked that out of the park.

16:10.483 --> 16:11.903
Are you waiting on a better offer?

16:11.906 --> 16:13.372
Please don't make this about you.

16:13.375 --> 16:15.296
This is about me. About us.

16:15.299 --> 16:17.187
How long are we supposed
to put our lives on hold

16:17.189 --> 16:19.356
- for your family?
- Oh, look who's talking.

16:19.358 --> 16:21.091
You're the one with a secret mistress.

16:21.093 --> 16:22.893
- Excuse me?
- I see you texting

16:22.895 --> 16:24.617
your little minion, Josh.

16:24.620 --> 16:26.935
You've traveled for seven years
and never left your precious

16:26.937 --> 16:28.507
New Orleans behind.

16:35.641 --> 16:38.041
- Klaus is at it again.
- Great, what's the point

16:38.043 --> 16:40.644
of having all these rules
if Klaus doesn't follow them?

16:44.976 --> 16:46.288
Is that blood?

16:48.287 --> 16:50.320
Where's my phone?

16:59.999 --> 17:01.331
Don't overreact.

17:01.333 --> 17:03.634
Nik, you have pushed
it too far this time.

17:03.636 --> 17:06.483
I just had a bath with
blood spewing from the faucet

17:06.487 --> 17:07.786
like a carotid.

17:07.789 --> 17:09.856
Yes, it does appear to be escalating.

17:09.858 --> 17:12.476
It is bloody biblical, is what it is.

17:12.478 --> 17:13.944
You've stayed too long.

17:13.945 --> 17:15.846
Do I have any requests?

17:19.117 --> 17:20.917
How does he look?

17:23.656 --> 17:25.454
Happy.

17:25.457 --> 17:27.491
He seems happy.

17:27.492 --> 17:29.293
You spoke to him?

17:29.295 --> 17:31.773
I never dared before.

17:34.920 --> 17:36.866
I miss him, too, Nik.

17:36.869 --> 17:39.609
But you have got to leave. Now.

17:47.096 --> 17:50.153
Can you just yell at me already?

17:50.156 --> 17:51.984
Seven hours

17:51.987 --> 17:54.051
of hostile silence is punishment enough.

17:54.053 --> 17:56.653
The whole point of
sending you to that school

17:56.655 --> 17:58.522
and calling you Hope Marshall

17:58.524 --> 18:00.757
was so that you wouldn't
draw attention to yourself,

18:00.759 --> 18:02.262
to keep you safe.

18:02.265 --> 18:04.761
Why? Why did you do it?

18:04.763 --> 18:07.264
What could you have possibly
needed the money for?

18:07.266 --> 18:08.500
That's my business.

18:08.503 --> 18:09.914
And selling your blood is mine.

18:09.917 --> 18:11.802
- You had no right.
- You're being a hypocrite.

18:11.804 --> 18:13.953
You're the one that taught
me "my body, my choice."

18:13.956 --> 18:15.664
Well, my blood, my choice.

18:15.667 --> 18:18.708
You are not just anybody, Hope.

18:18.711 --> 18:22.779
Do you even understand
what you have done?

18:22.781 --> 18:24.278
Henry came to me.

18:24.281 --> 18:25.882
And you should have said no.

18:27.485 --> 18:30.486
Hope, Henry was already a kid
who was struggling to fit in,

18:30.489 --> 18:33.348
and now... he's gonna be
only one of three hybrids

18:33.351 --> 18:34.391
in the world,

18:34.393 --> 18:37.194
and seen as a threat
to everyone in the city.

18:37.196 --> 18:39.196
You have no idea what you've done.

18:39.198 --> 18:40.998
You cannot create something

18:41.000 --> 18:43.528
- without taking responsibility for it.
- What are you gonna do?

18:43.531 --> 18:45.601
Ground me... a-and lock me up?

18:45.604 --> 18:47.539
I'll just whammy myself
out, I am a witch.

18:47.542 --> 18:51.000
And I am your mother...
Which means tomorrow

18:51.003 --> 18:52.903
I'm gonna have to clean
up the mess you've made

18:52.906 --> 18:54.338
before it gets worse.

19:01.919 --> 19:04.353
Okay, so what did you say?

19:04.356 --> 19:06.490
- Um...
- Wait a minute, are you packing?

19:06.492 --> 19:09.559
I'm... organizing.

19:09.561 --> 19:11.828
I said I don't know.

19:11.830 --> 19:13.906
But Keelin, she stayed in the city

19:13.909 --> 19:17.768
for six years waiting for
me... she deserves this.

19:17.770 --> 19:20.337
And I really want to go, but...

19:20.340 --> 19:22.668
now that Hope's gotten
herself into trouble, I just...

19:22.671 --> 19:24.567
- Wait a minute, what kind of trouble?
- She was

19:24.570 --> 19:26.731
helping a Crescent
pack boy at her school.

19:26.734 --> 19:31.464
Everybody picked on him, so...
she gave him some of her blood,

19:31.467 --> 19:32.833
so he'd...

19:32.836 --> 19:34.384
Become a hybrid?

19:34.386 --> 19:36.687
Vince, she knows it was wrong,

19:36.689 --> 19:38.522
- okay?
- No! No, no, no, no, no.

19:38.524 --> 19:41.558
No, ma'am, Miss Pam. Freya,
you ain't going nowhere.

19:41.560 --> 19:43.093
You're gonna get on
the phone with Keelin,

19:43.095 --> 19:45.228
and you're gonna tell her to
bring her butt back here, okay?

19:45.230 --> 19:46.396
Because you can't go anywhere.

19:46.398 --> 19:47.930
You and me, we are a team, right?

19:47.933 --> 19:49.433
- I know.
- We're the glue that holds this city together,

19:49.435 --> 19:51.368
- and you just can't go.
- Come on.

19:51.370 --> 19:52.769
Hope made a mistake.

19:52.771 --> 19:54.805
It will get sorted out.

19:54.807 --> 19:58.275
And besides, that's only two things.

19:58.278 --> 20:01.579
Everybody knows bad things
come in threes, so...

20:08.320 --> 20:11.488
So, is there anything
else you feel like sharing?

20:16.127 --> 20:18.427
Hope is... coming to the Quarter.

20:18.430 --> 20:19.930
- Yeah?
- Just...

20:19.932 --> 20:21.981
till this all blows
over. Look, it's nothing

20:21.984 --> 20:23.500
to worry about.

20:23.502 --> 20:25.368
Trust me.

20:36.781 --> 20:39.515
Hope is coming home.

20:39.518 --> 20:41.594
She created a hybrid.

20:47.344 --> 20:48.930
One, two, three.

20:50.262 --> 20:52.203
Yeah.

21:06.420 --> 21:08.620
Declan, I am so sorry.

21:08.622 --> 21:10.889
I didn't realize it was you.

21:10.891 --> 21:13.959
So you stand me up and
beat the crap out of me.

21:13.961 --> 21:16.728
And I forgot our date.

21:16.730 --> 21:17.896
I am so sorry.

21:17.898 --> 21:19.825
Something came up with Hope.

21:19.828 --> 21:20.911
Is she okay?

21:20.914 --> 21:24.068
Yes, it's just complicated.

21:24.071 --> 21:28.447
Look, I know how you feel
about the dreaded "B" word.

21:28.450 --> 21:32.978
But as your boyfriend and a
big fan of your daughter's,

21:32.980 --> 21:35.213
I'd really like to help.

21:35.215 --> 21:39.050
I so wish that you could, Declan.

21:39.052 --> 21:41.013
It's just, right now,

21:41.016 --> 21:43.155
I think Hope is gonna
need all of my attention,

21:43.157 --> 21:46.802
which means maybe you and
I should probably take it...

21:46.805 --> 21:48.182
Right, don't finish that sentence.

21:48.185 --> 21:49.394
I deserve better than that.

21:49.396 --> 21:51.296
Come on, I'm a chef.
You're a good eater.

21:51.298 --> 21:52.575
You can't break up with me.

21:52.578 --> 21:54.083
Well, you can't break up with someone

21:54.086 --> 21:55.857
if you're not really a couple.

21:55.860 --> 21:58.335
Well, one half of this
couple was deeply committed.

21:58.338 --> 22:00.197
I'm sorry. If you want to break up,

22:00.200 --> 22:02.073
you have to do it like
a civilized person,

22:02.075 --> 22:04.263
at a bar with bourbon.

22:09.883 --> 22:11.458
Meet me later.

22:15.222 --> 22:17.289
How is my little ne'er-do-well?

22:17.291 --> 22:20.424
I've been better. How's Davina?

22:20.427 --> 22:23.458
My darling wife is gorging
on papaya right now.

22:23.461 --> 22:25.263
You know, Belize is
beautiful this time of year.

22:25.265 --> 22:26.364
You should visit.

22:26.366 --> 22:28.500
I'd love to, but...

22:28.502 --> 22:29.837
I'm grounded.

22:29.840 --> 22:30.822
Grounded?

22:30.825 --> 22:32.176
Can't ground a witch,

22:32.179 --> 22:33.611
let alone my favorite niece.

22:33.614 --> 22:34.706
That's what I said.

22:34.708 --> 22:36.479
Mom didn't think it was funny.

22:36.482 --> 22:39.244
Well, I'm sure it will all
blow over by Mardi Gras.

22:39.246 --> 22:44.713
I... I didn't think it was
such a big deal at the time,

22:44.716 --> 22:47.118
but now that it's
stirred up so much trouble

22:47.120 --> 22:48.653
I-I feel kind of bad.

22:48.655 --> 22:50.589
Darling, you can't get
your knickers in a knot

22:50.591 --> 22:52.157
every time you have a little kerfuffle.

22:52.159 --> 22:54.459
You'll never have a moment of pleasure.

22:54.461 --> 22:56.528
And I, for one, thought you showed

22:56.530 --> 22:58.830
some real entrepreneurial spirit.

22:58.832 --> 23:00.932
Yeah, that's me,

23:00.934 --> 23:02.630
your friendly,
neighborhood blood dealer.

23:02.633 --> 23:03.861
I'm sure you've noticed by now

23:03.864 --> 23:05.470
the best people are black sheep.

23:05.472 --> 23:07.339
Like my dad?

23:07.341 --> 23:09.241
I was referring to me.

23:09.243 --> 23:12.277
Niklaus is in a league of his own.

23:12.279 --> 23:13.979
Seen him lately?

23:13.981 --> 23:15.914
Well, thankfully for you, no.

23:15.916 --> 23:17.450
Don't worry.

23:17.453 --> 23:21.056
Sooner or later, something
will blow up in New Orleans.

23:21.059 --> 23:24.966
Some crisis or other
always brings us back.

23:27.728 --> 23:30.295
Okay.

23:30.297 --> 23:33.031
Is Hope proud of herself?

23:33.033 --> 23:35.734
Henry is barely home and
we're getting threats.

23:35.736 --> 23:37.168
The vampires will never trust him

23:37.170 --> 23:39.181
and how long before
the pack turns on him?

23:39.184 --> 23:41.206
The pack will adjust.

23:41.208 --> 23:43.223
Henry doesn't need to
be afraid of anything.

23:43.226 --> 23:45.483
Have you been at the top
of the alpha heap so long

23:45.486 --> 23:47.075
that you don't get how this works?

23:48.215 --> 23:50.512
Your daughter put a target on his back.

23:50.515 --> 23:51.848
We can limit the damage

23:51.851 --> 23:53.684
if we just work together.

23:53.687 --> 23:56.855
For ten years I've been
all the family this boy has.

23:56.857 --> 24:00.091
I'm not letting him down now
by trusting the wrong person,

24:00.093 --> 24:01.359
alpha or no.

24:01.361 --> 24:02.848
You can trust me.

24:02.851 --> 24:04.095
I swear.

24:04.097 --> 24:06.564
Tell me one thing.

24:06.566 --> 24:10.702
Are you here as a
Crescent or as a Mikaelson?

24:10.704 --> 24:13.004
I'm here as a mom.

24:13.007 --> 24:16.475
My kid screwed up. I can't change that.

24:18.320 --> 24:21.575
But I can try and make up for it.

24:25.819 --> 24:27.692
If my bloody brother

24:27.695 --> 24:29.020
doesn't answer the bloody phone,

24:29.023 --> 24:30.522
I swear, I am going to rip his heart...

24:30.524 --> 24:31.756
I don't want to hear it.

24:31.758 --> 24:33.595
Okay? I don't want to hear another thing

24:33.598 --> 24:37.929
until after you say, "I do,"
at city hall at 3:45 today.

24:37.932 --> 24:41.650
I have waited decades for things
to be right with your family.

24:41.653 --> 24:42.934
No more.

24:45.051 --> 24:47.520
We are either all in...

24:47.523 --> 24:49.341
or we're done.

24:49.343 --> 24:51.009
The choice is yours.

25:07.928 --> 25:10.328
"Knew you weren't just a pretty face.

25:10.330 --> 25:13.031
There's one more
present docked in Monaco.

25:13.033 --> 25:16.716
Seemed like a nice place to honeymoon."

25:20.520 --> 25:24.842
_

25:26.039 --> 25:27.570
Damn it.

25:35.784 --> 25:37.721
_

25:37.724 --> 25:39.750
Bonjour, Monsieur Gatineaux.

25:39.753 --> 25:41.540
I should let you live to tell of this,

25:41.543 --> 25:43.883
but I seem to be on a bit of a roll.

25:48.068 --> 25:49.934
Oh.

25:51.271 --> 25:54.205
Why don't you pick on
someone your own size?

25:54.207 --> 25:55.992
Hello, luv.

26:04.691 --> 26:08.657
It's a pity. I thought
there'd be more of them.

26:08.660 --> 26:11.062
Trying to break your own record?

26:11.064 --> 26:13.631
At the moment, I'm trying
not to flatter myself

26:13.633 --> 26:16.106
that you're here on a
sudden whim to see me.

26:17.903 --> 26:21.071
Why are you here, Caroline?

26:21.074 --> 26:23.708
Surely, the Salvatore School
for the Young and Gifted

26:23.710 --> 26:25.443
needs its headmistress across the pond.

26:25.446 --> 26:26.645
I got a phone call.

26:26.648 --> 26:28.681
Apparently, you don't pick up anymore.

26:28.684 --> 26:32.059
So, you came all this
way at Hayley's request?

26:32.062 --> 26:34.017
Rebekah called, actually.

26:34.020 --> 26:36.176
I was in France already.

26:36.179 --> 26:37.421
Winter getaway?

26:37.424 --> 26:38.910
For work.

26:42.395 --> 26:45.529
I don't know what year
you think it is, Klaus,

26:45.531 --> 26:47.498
but I'm the mother of twins,

26:47.500 --> 26:50.167
I was married and
widowed on the same day,

26:50.169 --> 26:52.571
and I am responsible
for an entire school

26:52.574 --> 26:55.539
full of kids, including yours.

26:55.542 --> 26:58.310
You know, the one that
you haven't asked about.

27:00.913 --> 27:03.590
Why are you avoiding her?

27:03.593 --> 27:05.727
She's beautiful and smart.

27:05.730 --> 27:06.896
So smart.

27:06.899 --> 27:08.949
Maybe too smart for her own good...

27:08.952 --> 27:10.574
like her father.

27:14.317 --> 27:15.660
But Hope...

27:15.662 --> 27:20.698
she hears the same rumors we all
have over the past five years,

27:20.700 --> 27:24.317
that you have gone completely bonkers.

27:27.074 --> 27:28.918
As you see.

27:32.210 --> 27:35.121
Yet, standing here...

27:35.124 --> 27:37.892
you seem only normal crazy to me.

27:37.895 --> 27:40.284
High praise, indeed.

27:44.157 --> 27:47.091
You know, two men from the
family who own this building

27:47.093 --> 27:49.160
were killed at a nightclub yesterday

27:49.162 --> 27:51.962
by an alleged maniac.

27:51.964 --> 27:54.098
And here lie more bodies.

27:54.100 --> 27:56.200
Care to explain why you're
methodically picking off

27:56.202 --> 27:58.169
all the members of one family?

27:58.171 --> 28:01.650
Because I'm compulsive.

28:01.653 --> 28:05.443
Or perhaps it's just
to while away the time.

28:05.445 --> 28:06.844
Or maybe...

28:06.846 --> 28:09.680
just maybe,

28:09.682 --> 28:13.317
Klaus Mikaelson has finally gone mad.

28:14.861 --> 28:18.622
Or maybe you just want
people to think you have.

28:18.624 --> 28:21.225
This spree you're on,

28:21.227 --> 28:22.827
it isn't random.

28:24.322 --> 28:26.155
You have a list.

28:26.165 --> 28:28.366
Don't you?

28:32.080 --> 28:33.771
- Over here!
- Break it up.

28:33.773 --> 28:36.212
Come on!

28:40.079 --> 28:43.381
Hey.

28:43.383 --> 28:46.291
So, talked to Rebekah about the blood

28:46.294 --> 28:49.317
and Klaus got too close to Elijah.

28:49.320 --> 28:52.255
And so he tempts fate while his
daughter wakes sleeping dogs.

28:52.258 --> 28:53.255
That's great.

28:53.258 --> 28:55.025
- Yeah.
- Hey.

28:55.027 --> 28:56.187
You see this over here?

28:56.190 --> 28:58.023
What seems to be the problem here?

28:58.026 --> 29:00.992
This town is just going from
zero to 60 in no time flat.

29:00.995 --> 29:03.899
I'm not even surprised that
nosey vampire, Greta Sienna,

29:03.902 --> 29:05.500
is all up in the mix.

29:05.503 --> 29:07.838
Freya, this town is just
itching for some sort of fight

29:07.840 --> 29:10.142
- and if we don't do something...
- Vincent.

29:10.145 --> 29:14.311
I know this is serious,
believe me, but, um...

29:14.313 --> 29:16.275
man, I'm fighting for my life.

29:18.384 --> 29:21.118
I love Keelin.

29:21.120 --> 29:25.122
And if-if I don't go to see
her now, I'm-I'm gonna lose her.

29:25.124 --> 29:26.724
Now, look,

29:26.726 --> 29:30.551
listen, I am terrified that
if I walk out this door,

29:30.554 --> 29:33.329
everything is just gonna
go to hell, but I...

29:33.332 --> 29:35.499
I know you can do this without me.

29:35.501 --> 29:37.298
Right now, I just need to hear

29:37.301 --> 29:40.465
that leaving isn't gonna
make me a bad sister

29:40.468 --> 29:44.341
or a bad aunt or a bad
friend and, I don't know,

29:44.343 --> 29:48.245
maybe I'll get the guts
to pick myself for once.

29:48.247 --> 29:50.815
Hey, guys.

29:50.817 --> 29:53.423
I am not digging the vibe in here.

29:53.426 --> 29:54.809
Control yourself, please.

29:54.812 --> 29:57.996
More of a live-and-let-live
vampire, so I'm cutting out.

29:57.999 --> 29:59.020
I hear you.

29:59.023 --> 30:00.870
Uh, Pops, what do we
owe you for all of this?

30:00.873 --> 30:02.625
Oh, shut up. It's on me.

30:02.628 --> 30:03.828
Peace out.

30:03.830 --> 30:06.054
Why don't you just calm down

30:06.057 --> 30:08.364
and we can talk about this later?

30:10.955 --> 30:13.269
Freya, I'm not not even sure
that we can stop all this.

30:13.272 --> 30:15.072
I mean, we put it on
pause for a few years,

30:15.074 --> 30:17.489
but how are you supposed
to stop human nature?

30:17.492 --> 30:20.957
Or vampire, werewolf, witch nature.

30:20.960 --> 30:22.059
Right.

30:23.749 --> 30:25.649
You should go.

30:27.520 --> 30:30.020
You should go because I
have absolutely no idea

30:30.022 --> 30:32.333
how this is going to end up,
and I think at least one of us

30:32.335 --> 30:33.824
should have a shot at happiness.

30:53.366 --> 30:54.944
Going somewhere?

30:54.947 --> 30:56.614
Is that what you needed the money for?

30:56.616 --> 30:58.426
Now you're rummaging in my room?

30:58.429 --> 30:59.850
For laundry.

30:59.852 --> 31:01.418
Where were you going?

31:01.420 --> 31:03.496
I met a guy online.

31:03.499 --> 31:06.223
And he's in a band
and he lives in London.

31:06.225 --> 31:09.326
He says he's 25, but he seems older.

31:10.561 --> 31:12.585
You wanted to see your dad.

31:16.602 --> 31:18.504
I know it's stupid.

31:18.507 --> 31:20.406
He obviously doesn't care,

31:20.409 --> 31:22.238
but I-I just thought,

31:22.241 --> 31:23.941
maybe if we were in the same place

31:23.943 --> 31:25.903
for even a little while...

31:25.906 --> 31:28.412
It's not stupid.

31:28.414 --> 31:30.548
He loves you.

31:30.550 --> 31:32.648
But he just knows that being near you

31:32.651 --> 31:34.850
puts you in danger.

31:34.853 --> 31:37.153
A phone call wouldn't.

31:42.423 --> 31:43.856
Look, I...

31:43.859 --> 31:45.963
I really...

31:45.965 --> 31:49.066
hope one day that you'll
talk in person. I do.

31:49.068 --> 31:51.335
But until then, just...

31:52.638 --> 31:56.607
try not to judge him too harshly.

31:57.877 --> 32:01.262
So... I can't judge my deadbeat dad,

32:01.265 --> 32:02.713
but you can judge me?

32:02.715 --> 32:06.417
I don't judge you; I judge your actions.

32:06.419 --> 32:07.820
I'm your mom.

32:07.823 --> 32:10.559
I love you, and I would
forgive you for anything.

32:10.562 --> 32:12.389
But that's not...

32:12.392 --> 32:15.226
that's not a blank
check for bad behavior.

32:17.613 --> 32:18.746
I did one thing.

32:18.749 --> 32:20.431
Hope!

32:20.433 --> 32:22.566
Hope!

32:27.483 --> 32:30.384
I... I made a mistake.

32:46.686 --> 32:50.155
No one wants any trouble,
Hayley. We just want the hybrid.

32:50.158 --> 32:51.753
You're not getting Henry!

32:51.756 --> 32:53.156
Let me handle this.

32:53.158 --> 32:56.993
Remember that that hybrid is just a kid.

32:56.996 --> 32:59.972
But Poppy was just trying
to walk home from work,

32:59.975 --> 33:02.023
and she was our friend.

33:02.026 --> 33:03.826
He's not going anywhere.

33:05.413 --> 33:07.236
Hayley, you might not have a choice.

33:07.239 --> 33:09.138
I didn't even know that girl.

33:09.140 --> 33:10.397
I can't hear.

33:10.400 --> 33:13.275
She just bumped into me, and I-I just...

33:13.278 --> 33:15.111
I got so angry.

33:15.113 --> 33:16.378
They-they want...

33:16.381 --> 33:17.981
- they want to kill me, huh?
- Henry,

33:17.983 --> 33:19.616
relax, for God's sake.

33:19.618 --> 33:22.318
Just... feel better.

33:28.760 --> 33:30.460
Okay.

33:31.983 --> 33:33.683
That's-that's weird.

33:33.686 --> 33:38.061
You... you said "feel better,"
and I actually feel better.

33:39.538 --> 33:42.372
Because my blood made
you a hybrid, so...

33:42.374 --> 33:45.108
you're sired to me.

33:45.110 --> 33:48.278
- I have to do what you say?
- Pretty much,

33:48.280 --> 33:52.849
but don't worry, I...
believe in personal autonomy.

33:52.851 --> 33:55.351
But for now,

33:55.353 --> 33:56.486
stay here.

33:56.488 --> 33:58.655
We need to be rational.

33:58.657 --> 34:00.723
Should they go back
and tell Poppy's mother

34:00.725 --> 34:02.058
her daughter's killer's free,

34:02.061 --> 34:03.426
but at least we were rational?

34:03.428 --> 34:04.894
Peace is complicated.

34:04.896 --> 34:07.297
We haven't had it all this
time because we've been perfect.

34:07.299 --> 34:10.766
We've had it because we haven't
overreacted when we're not.

34:10.768 --> 34:13.570
Revenge isn't justice.

34:13.572 --> 34:15.772
Do we really want to sacrifice a...

34:15.774 --> 34:18.675
a kid to assuage our fear?

34:18.677 --> 34:21.505
He's not just a kid. He's a hybrid.

34:21.507 --> 34:23.947
With the power to kill
any vampire he chooses.

34:23.949 --> 34:26.594
I'm a hybrid. I'm not
a threat to anyone.

34:26.597 --> 34:28.594
And after I teach Henry self-control,

34:28.597 --> 34:30.018
he won't be, either.

34:30.021 --> 34:32.255
Look, every death

34:32.257 --> 34:33.656
is a tragedy.

34:33.658 --> 34:37.654
And I'm truly sorry for
Poppy and her family.

34:37.657 --> 34:40.929
But we've evolved beyond an
"eye for an eye" mentality.

34:40.931 --> 34:42.599
This is a test.

34:43.701 --> 34:47.703
Don't... throw away
all we've accomplished.

34:47.706 --> 34:50.708
- You can't be serious.
- I've never been more serious.

34:50.710 --> 34:53.172
It's my experience that those
who are wronged seek revenge.

34:53.176 --> 34:54.809
And since many have long memories,

34:54.812 --> 34:56.880
I am determined to
systematically annihilate

34:56.882 --> 34:58.348
each and every one of our enemies.

34:58.350 --> 34:59.851
And the heirs of our enemies.

34:59.854 --> 35:02.085
But... that list is endless.

35:02.087 --> 35:03.820
It's the only way to protect Elijah.

35:03.822 --> 35:05.588
In his current state,

35:05.591 --> 35:07.958
he wouldn't know an enemy if
they sat down at his piano.

35:07.961 --> 35:09.659
And it...

35:09.661 --> 35:12.295
it passes the time.

35:12.297 --> 35:14.597
Though why we're bothering
with all of this, I don't know.

35:14.599 --> 35:16.899
It's a historical building.

35:16.901 --> 35:19.184
Just take this.

35:19.187 --> 35:21.170
Start here.

35:27.646 --> 35:29.512
You may have started out playing crazy

35:29.514 --> 35:31.381
to make your enemies fear you,

35:31.383 --> 35:34.550
but now I'm not so sure
that you're pretending.

35:34.553 --> 35:37.688
This isn't right, Klaus, even for you.

35:39.857 --> 35:42.457
I find I'm not good without Elijah.

35:42.460 --> 35:44.627
I mean, we've been...

35:44.636 --> 35:47.237
parted before, but not like this.

35:48.299 --> 35:51.034
This is worse than if he were dead.

35:54.839 --> 35:56.973
I've lost my brother.

35:56.975 --> 35:59.555
But you still have a daughter.

35:59.558 --> 36:00.909
She's better off without me.

36:00.912 --> 36:02.348
I know

36:02.351 --> 36:04.647
what it's like to be
raised by a monster.

36:04.649 --> 36:08.370
Oh, my... Come on, that was,
like, a thousand years ago.

36:08.373 --> 36:09.887
Really? "Mean dad"?

36:09.890 --> 36:11.721
Newsflash: The guy's dead.

36:11.723 --> 36:12.711
Get over it!

36:12.714 --> 36:14.461
Stop using Michael as an excuse

36:14.464 --> 36:16.336
to be a bad father.

36:20.398 --> 36:22.165
I also know what it's like

36:22.167 --> 36:24.067
to be a kid missing her father.

36:24.069 --> 36:28.380
You may not be able to be
in the same room with her,

36:28.383 --> 36:29.872
but there is this...

36:29.874 --> 36:32.442
this ancient gadget called a telephone.

36:32.444 --> 36:34.444
Use it

36:34.447 --> 36:37.687
before you lose your
daughter and she loses you.

36:39.451 --> 36:41.517
Because...

36:41.519 --> 36:44.367
I happen to think that
you're someone worth knowing.

36:50.177 --> 36:52.750
I'll see you at the next
parent-teacher conference.

37:01.973 --> 37:04.067
Hey, Declan. It's me.

37:04.070 --> 37:05.541
Um...

37:05.543 --> 37:07.410
don't kill me, but...

37:07.412 --> 37:09.479
something's come up.

37:09.481 --> 37:11.637
Wait there, have a drink,

37:11.640 --> 37:14.645
and... I'll just be there a little late.

37:14.648 --> 37:17.086
It's been a long day, and...

37:17.088 --> 37:19.222
I'd really like to see you.

38:05.855 --> 38:07.855
I'm a coward.

38:07.857 --> 38:10.457
And a hypocrite.

38:10.459 --> 38:13.594
It's true I miss my family, but...

38:13.596 --> 38:18.098
I suppose I'm always running away.

38:18.100 --> 38:21.735
Well, sometimes it's good
to make a fresh start.

38:24.140 --> 38:27.074
Is it odd having
strangers confide in you?

38:29.394 --> 38:31.373
I guess I just have that kind of face.

38:40.823 --> 38:43.107
I think it's a nice face.

38:53.870 --> 38:55.235
- Hey, jailbird.
- Hey.

38:55.238 --> 38:59.095
I've got some news about me and Keelin.

38:59.098 --> 39:00.608
- Where's your mom?
- I don't know.

39:00.610 --> 39:02.532
She said she'd only
be gone a few minutes,

39:02.535 --> 39:04.077
but then she never came back.

39:04.080 --> 39:05.913
Where'd she go?

39:05.915 --> 39:07.781
Outside to make a call.

39:07.783 --> 39:09.709
Auntie Freya?

39:13.597 --> 39:16.998
The tricky thing about tipping points...

39:19.161 --> 39:22.727
is you can only define
them in retrospect.

39:24.891 --> 39:27.842
Who can say which choice
led to a car crash, or...

39:29.272 --> 39:31.045
which cigarette started the cancer?

39:37.179 --> 39:41.240
_

39:42.834 --> 39:44.834
And so we blindly stumble forward,

39:44.837 --> 39:47.421
never sure how close we are to the edge.

39:53.629 --> 39:56.030
Someone found this in the street.

39:59.502 --> 40:01.335
All I know for certain

40:01.337 --> 40:03.696
is if the four Mikaelsons come together,

40:03.699 --> 40:06.907
it will signal darkness
like we've never known.

40:17.386 --> 40:19.119
Dad?

40:32.056 --> 40:34.134
I was looking for your mother.

40:34.136 --> 40:36.103
Yeah, so are we.

40:36.105 --> 40:38.842
Um... I don't know where she is.

40:38.845 --> 40:40.407
She's missing.

40:46.243 --> 40:47.876
I'm on my way.

40:49.485 --> 40:52.653
So many possible tipping points.

40:58.169 --> 41:00.040
But without the benefit of hindsight,

41:00.043 --> 41:02.677
how will we know if we're at
the end of the beginning...

41:12.899 --> 41:14.735
or the beginning of the end?
