00:07.800 --> 00:11.952
Hey, chocolate bear. I didn't have time
to shower. Did you wax your dome?

00:12.040 --> 00:13.553
I sure did, why?

00:19.880 --> 00:21.598
- Thanks, pal.
- Uh-huh.

00:21.680 --> 00:23.318
Hold up.

00:24.760 --> 00:25.749
Chapped.

00:25.840 --> 00:28.354
Easy, mooch,
that stuff is 40 bucks a tin.

00:28.440 --> 00:32.319
<i>With hospital hours, you don't have time</i>
<i>to wor</i> ry <i>about your appearance.</i>

00:32.400 --> 00:37.110
<i>It may sound sexist, but with the female</i>
<i>doctors, it's more noticeable.</i>

00:37.200 --> 00:40.158
Hey, Janice, is it windy out?

00:40.240 --> 00:42.993
No. Why do you always ask me that?

00:43.080 --> 00:48.029
Because I'm captain of my
kite flying team. The Mighty Kites?

00:49.960 --> 00:52.633
<i>OK, just say something innocuous.</i>

00:52.720 --> 00:54.358
Morning, gentlemen.

00:54.440 --> 00:58.035
<i>Most of them don't even bother t</i> ry <i>ing,</i>
<i>except, of course...</i>

00:58.120 --> 00:59.155
Hey, girlfriends.

01:01.160 --> 01:03.754
How do you have time
to look so good every morning?

01:05.000 --> 01:11.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

01:17.440 --> 01:20.398
Oh, this?
Yeah, it doesn't take long.

01:21.680 --> 01:24.194
<i>I guess eve</i> ry <i>one</i>
<i>has their morning routines.</i>

01:26.640 --> 01:29.108
Hi, cutie.
Since you have so many balls

01:29.200 --> 01:32.272
and too many toys
can be overstimulating for an infant,

01:32.360 --> 01:35.477
Brantley here was wondering
if he could borrow one.

01:35.560 --> 01:38.154
That's funny
because Jack was just wondering

01:38.240 --> 01:41.312
why the crazy lady
who spent the last hour chain smoking

01:41.400 --> 01:44.153
and talking on her cell phone
while her kid ate sand

01:44.240 --> 01:48.518
would come over to two strangers
and give them parenting advice.

01:48.600 --> 01:51.876
He also thanked me
for not naming him Brantley.

01:55.600 --> 01:57.511
I love our family.

02:00.520 --> 02:02.431
<i>Married With Children?</i> Awesome.

02:02.520 --> 02:04.636
- Has Kelly been on yet?
- Here she comes.

02:04.720 --> 02:06.153
<i>Hi, Daddy.</i>

02:07.000 --> 02:09.639
Where's Danni?
We're gonna be late for our movie.

02:11.440 --> 02:15.115
Stop. Let me just go grab a sweater.
I love you.

02:17.480 --> 02:20.552
- She's using the "L" word.
- We're not really that serious.

02:21.680 --> 02:23.193
This isn't the movies.

02:23.280 --> 02:26.158
I just wanted you to see this
because if I move here,

02:26.240 --> 02:29.277
this would be the type of place
we could afford.

02:40.120 --> 02:44.511
- Out-of-body experience?
- Yeah. I have to break up with her.

02:44.600 --> 02:48.639
Dude, relax. Enjoy the show.
Have a Bugle.

02:49.800 --> 02:51.597
Your ghost hands is cold.

02:54.440 --> 02:57.238
I wanted to pretend I had witch nails.

02:57.320 --> 02:58.912
- What?
- Nothing.

03:20.960 --> 03:25.397
I can't believe how comfortable I am
talking to you over these last months.

03:25.480 --> 03:27.391
I'd still be with my old shrink

03:27.480 --> 03:30.517
if I hadn't cut across the park
when the fair was on

03:30.600 --> 03:33.114
and realised that the man
I tell my secrets to

03:33.200 --> 03:38.228
likes to put on a big giant beard
and pretend that he is a blacksmith.

03:39.200 --> 03:42.829
Anyway, something weird
has been going on with me lately.

03:42.920 --> 03:46.390
I have been sleeping more,
I have been drinking alone less.

03:46.480 --> 03:48.710
<i>I've even started complimenting people.</i>

03:48.800 --> 03:51.519
Come on, get your pump on.

03:51.600 --> 03:55.559
God help me, if you get any more buff
I'll be sure that you're gay.

03:55.640 --> 03:57.551
I'm gonna get more buff.

04:01.520 --> 04:03.750
Dr Cox never compliments me.

04:03.840 --> 04:07.833
Well, he should. Your new look
has changed my perspective.

04:07.920 --> 04:12.038
For instance,
this is not a broom with fraying edges.

04:12.120 --> 04:16.910
This is now a broom that reminds me
of your bangs, tough and spunky.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.548
That is exactly
the look that I was going for.

04:21.160 --> 04:22.559
Really?

04:25.800 --> 04:29.236
How about I give you a ride
to your next destination?

04:31.040 --> 04:32.951
To the morgue!

04:34.520 --> 04:35.714
Watch it!

04:37.640 --> 04:39.437
So did you break up with her?

04:39.520 --> 04:44.435
I was going to but I looked in her eyes
and I realised how rare it is

04:44.520 --> 04:47.239
to meet someone who's willing
to have sex with me.

04:47.320 --> 04:49.709
How did you have sex with her?

04:49.800 --> 04:53.349
You know how the couch
in the living room has those high arms.

04:53.440 --> 04:56.238
A guy will sleep with any woman
he finds attractive,

04:56.320 --> 04:58.151
no matter how he feels about her.

04:58.240 --> 05:02.153
If Tyra Banks drove her car over my mom
and then offered to have sex with me,

05:02.240 --> 05:05.550
I'd have to dial 911 in the nude
because my pants would be off.

05:05.640 --> 05:08.473
That's sweet.
While your mother lays there dying.

05:08.560 --> 05:10.278
- Tell her.
- His mom doesn't die.

05:10.360 --> 05:13.955
Tyra uses her supermodel connections
to get government scientists

05:14.040 --> 05:16.759
to put Turk's mom's brain
into Heidi Klum's body.

05:16.840 --> 05:19.559
She falls in love with me.
We all move in together.

05:19.640 --> 05:23.189
It'd be aw <i>kw</i> ard at first
but I'd make it work.

05:23.280 --> 05:26.829
- Because I love my mom.
- And I would love her too.

05:26.920 --> 05:28.797
New low.

05:32.320 --> 05:35.153
Mrs Gorski,
I know shingles are never fun.

05:35.240 --> 05:38.073
Apart from the games we made up
on my parent's new roof.

05:38.160 --> 05:41.835
It was like hide-and-seek
only we'd throw shingles at each other.

05:41.920 --> 05:43.399
Ah, summer time.

05:43.480 --> 05:47.758
A positive attitude can help you feel
better so let's see a big old smile.

05:48.920 --> 05:52.037
Excuse me,
can I borrow Dr Reid?

05:52.120 --> 05:54.111
You may keep her.

05:54.600 --> 05:58.878
I like to think
that our patients choose our hospital

05:58.960 --> 06:02.999
not only because I leak rumours
about competing hospitals to the press,

06:03.080 --> 06:05.992
but also because
when they see one of our doctors,

06:06.080 --> 06:08.958
they think, "Now that's a professional."

06:09.920 --> 06:12.354
I don't think I look unprofessional.

06:12.440 --> 06:16.274
I've let this whole new look
thing slide the last few months

06:16.360 --> 06:18.874
but now your colleagues are complaining,

06:18.960 --> 06:23.431
I'm going to give you the same advice
I give my son every morning.

06:23.520 --> 06:28.594
Lose the make-up, get a haircut and stop
using my razor to shave your fun zone.

06:33.480 --> 06:36.040
- I hate missing practice.
- Me too.

06:37.040 --> 06:39.270
Mighty Kites.

06:39.360 --> 06:43.148
Morning, class. As residency director,
it is my pleasure

06:43.240 --> 06:46.869
to have surgical
and medical personnel with us today.

06:46.960 --> 06:50.316
In this room we have enough brainpower
to light up a city.

06:50.400 --> 06:54.109
Not a real city, mind you,
but definitely a tiny ant city

06:54.200 --> 06:58.432
whose government has passed
stringent energy conservation laws.

06:58.520 --> 07:00.476
Stringent what?

07:01.440 --> 07:05.069
Stringent up doc.
It's happening.

07:05.160 --> 07:06.832
Yes, Nervous Guy?

07:06.920 --> 07:08.797
What's up doc?

07:10.200 --> 07:12.555
OK, people, biphasic defibrillators.

07:12.640 --> 07:16.792
How many of you had a chance
to practice on the mannequin?

07:18.320 --> 07:20.550
With the defibrillator?

07:22.120 --> 07:25.795
And I assume none of you
have even looked at the literature?

07:26.800 --> 07:30.475
And I didn't do anything.
No yelling, no breaking stuff, nothing.

07:30.560 --> 07:35.588
And right then,
I figured out what that feeling was

07:35.680 --> 07:40.800
that I was having in the park
with my family. I'm... happy.

07:41.960 --> 07:44.554
Now does that not just make you sick?

07:46.760 --> 07:48.716
Keep your eyes on the prize.

07:48.800 --> 07:53.430
Focus on how great it is to be single,
chasing tail. I miss it every day.

07:53.520 --> 07:55.670
Don't you care
if you ever have sex again?

07:55.760 --> 08:00.436
Baby, I'm trying to keep my man psyched.
JD's never broken up with anyone.

08:00.520 --> 08:04.399
I don't like hurting people.
I'm gonna do the honourable thing.

08:04.480 --> 08:07.950
I'm gonna have a fireman tell Danni
I burned to death.

08:08.040 --> 08:12.591
Bambi, you owe her closure. Hell, you
owe it to every woman you've ever dated.

08:14.160 --> 08:15.752
Listen, Danni.

08:16.360 --> 08:17.349
Lisa.

08:18.160 --> 08:21.311
Drunk friend of the girl
I really wanted to hook up with.

08:21.400 --> 08:25.075
It's not all of you. It's me.

08:26.920 --> 08:28.353
Scott Gerber?

08:28.440 --> 08:31.512
At soccer camp, I told you
I wanted to be more than friends.

08:31.600 --> 08:35.035
- I thought you meant teammates.
- Well, I didn't.

08:36.080 --> 08:40.073
He used to borrow my jersey
and wear it as jammies.

08:44.600 --> 08:47.478
Hey, Danni, it's me.
What are you up to?

08:47.560 --> 08:49.357
- I'm keeping busy.
- Great.

08:49.440 --> 08:52.352
- Listen, something's been on my mind.
- Me, too.

08:52.440 --> 08:56.638
I feel like my life is so scattered.
You're the only good thing I have going.

08:56.720 --> 08:57.709
Awesome.

08:57.800 --> 09:00.394
- How's he doing?
- The boy's got no biscuits.

09:00.480 --> 09:02.994
I am trying to break
someone's heart here, OK?

09:03.080 --> 09:05.389
Do you have a second to talk?

09:05.480 --> 09:10.474
Actually, I'm kind of swamped right now.
Let me get back to you, OK?

09:10.560 --> 09:12.516
Elliot, What's wrong?

09:12.600 --> 09:17.276
- Forget it, you're busy.
- Come on. I always have time for you.

09:18.160 --> 09:20.913
Have the doctors been
making fun of the way I look?

09:21.000 --> 09:24.151
What? I've never even heard
anything like that. Why?

09:24.240 --> 09:25.355
Hell, yeah.

09:26.440 --> 09:30.399
Only the girl ones.
And, you know, they're all...

09:30.480 --> 09:32.755
- Cat fight?
- Sorry, Todd.

09:32.840 --> 09:37.550
Let's try and be more careful
when we use that noise, OK? God!

09:38.560 --> 09:42.473
I haven't been this happy
since Christmas when I was seven

09:42.560 --> 09:45.518
and my father showed me
how to make a snow angel.

09:45.600 --> 09:47.955
Actually, he was passed out
drunk in the yard

09:48.040 --> 09:52.556
but I did take his arms and his legs
and move them back and forth and...

09:52.640 --> 09:56.679
the paramedics said
it was a great snow angel.

09:56.760 --> 10:01.959
Maybe the fact that I am
the kinder, gentler Cox is OK.

10:02.040 --> 10:05.032
Maybe it's a natural progression.

10:05.120 --> 10:08.112
It's not like
there's any real ramifications.

10:09.320 --> 10:10.309
Right?

10:12.440 --> 10:15.716
What the hell, Peter Pants?
Are you the only one here?

10:15.800 --> 10:20.271
I drew the short straw. I have to press
"record" on all the tape players.

10:20.360 --> 10:23.432
Of course you do.
But you don't expect me...

10:30.080 --> 10:31.593
Where is everybody?

10:31.680 --> 10:35.389
They all had
really important things to do.

10:36.320 --> 10:38.038
Hello, citizens.

10:38.120 --> 10:43.035
Welcome to Sacred Heart,
home of the world's most giant doctor.

10:43.120 --> 10:48.069
Be not afraid.
I'm just like you, except I'm giant.

10:49.280 --> 10:51.191
My tush is chafing.

10:52.480 --> 10:54.311
All right, my turn to get on top.

10:54.400 --> 10:57.710
We tried playing Giant Black Guy,
remember? People ran.

10:57.800 --> 11:00.519
- Damn.
- And I gotta go deal with Danni.

11:00.600 --> 11:02.955
- You want me to talk to her for you?
- No.

11:03.040 --> 11:07.192
If someone doesn't care enough to do it
themselves it's like they never cared.

11:07.280 --> 11:10.795
Hey, guys.
JD, Danni's breaking up with you.

11:10.880 --> 11:13.633
Darn. See you.

11:13.720 --> 11:14.709
What?

11:16.160 --> 11:19.118
How many times do I have to tell you?
Stop wearing my coat.

11:19.200 --> 11:20.952
Sorry, about that, Chet.

11:29.640 --> 11:31.949
Which is Chet's?
We gotta put his coat back.

11:32.040 --> 11:34.270
Oh, I think it's this one.

11:34.360 --> 11:37.193
Look at the size of this Odor Eater.
We could surf on it.

11:37.280 --> 11:39.999
I don't understand
why Danni's breaking up with me.

11:40.920 --> 11:44.435
OK, words cannot describe
the smell that is currently on my cheek.

11:44.520 --> 11:49.230
You wanna go back in just cos she
rejected you? Who else is that crazy?

11:51.000 --> 11:56.120
Not one resident showed up.
Not one. Would you like to know why?

11:56.200 --> 12:00.671
Because they're not scared of me
any more and I blame you.

12:00.760 --> 12:05.754
You have turned me into this soft,
emotionally open, pathetic freak at home

12:05.840 --> 12:07.831
and it's bleeding over into work.

12:07.920 --> 12:12.232
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

12:12.320 --> 12:14.959
<i>And many more.</i>

12:15.040 --> 12:17.076
Oh, my God!

12:17.640 --> 12:18.868
Happy birthday.

12:18.960 --> 12:24.671
Oh, people, I've been here 23 years. For
the last time, I'm allergic to coconut.

12:25.240 --> 12:27.879
Elliot, have you been
in the supply closet crying?

12:27.960 --> 12:30.679
Carla, I don't do that any more.

12:33.280 --> 12:35.555
Oh, my God, I look like Alice Cooper.

12:35.640 --> 12:38.950
You know, I shouldn't have to feel bad
for wanting to look good.

12:39.040 --> 12:43.716
You don't, what with your
bohemian scarves and pirate earrings.

12:43.800 --> 12:45.518
Thank you for noticing.

12:45.600 --> 12:49.115
It's different for nurses.
We're not judged for being feminine.

12:49.200 --> 12:53.432
But if a doctor puts in too much effort
the men won't take her seriously

12:53.520 --> 12:57.308
and the women will think she's showing
them up. It's a dumb stereotype.

12:57.400 --> 13:00.233
You just have to decide
if it's worth the hassle.

13:07.600 --> 13:08.715
Laverne.

13:08.800 --> 13:10.711
Good cake, though.

13:12.840 --> 13:13.829
Hello?

13:17.360 --> 13:20.830
Your honker's cute in person,
peephole not your friend.

13:21.520 --> 13:24.512
Sorry, did I interrupt you
from trying to eat your baby?

13:25.480 --> 13:27.152
Danni's not here.

13:27.240 --> 13:29.800
Do you know how hard it was
for me to come here?

13:31.680 --> 13:32.829
- Gotcha.
- Oh, God.

13:32.920 --> 13:35.514
Not getting up
until you come to your senses.

13:35.600 --> 13:37.556
Get your coffee on, dawg.

13:39.000 --> 13:43.630
Say what you want, those big round
cheeks are warm in the morning.

13:43.720 --> 13:46.598
- What?
- I wanna know why she broke up with me.

13:46.680 --> 13:49.672
Well, why don't you just...
ask her yourself.

13:52.120 --> 13:53.394
Not cool.

13:56.400 --> 13:58.152
Now there you go, sweetheart.

13:58.240 --> 14:01.915
Now you look more like a doctor
and less like a lap dance.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.956
Thank you, sir.

14:07.280 --> 14:09.111
Floor's wet.

14:09.200 --> 14:13.671
I liked the way blonde-haired doctor
looked. She brightened my day.

14:13.760 --> 14:17.753
But you don't care, do you?
Because you're unconscious.

14:21.040 --> 14:24.430
I'm pre <i>tty</i> much thinking
it's time to get the fear back.

14:24.520 --> 14:28.798
Now I'm sorry, but I think life is just
too short to spend it working someplace

14:28.880 --> 14:31.792
where people don't crap their pants
at the sight of you.

14:32.400 --> 14:35.039
OK, listen up, people,
this part is crucial.

14:35.120 --> 14:38.192
In order to use the biphasic
defibrillator we have to...

14:39.440 --> 14:40.953
Sorry I'm late.

14:43.560 --> 14:46.597
Hey, Elliot. Is it greasy outside?

14:48.640 --> 14:51.871
That is so stupid.
Elliot, you look smart.

14:52.560 --> 14:55.199
- Hello?
- Of course I'm smart, I'm a doctor.

14:55.280 --> 14:57.999
What's up, doc! I just got it.

14:58.080 --> 15:00.196
Maybe Danni thinks I'm too smart.

15:00.280 --> 15:02.589
You're dating a guy named Danny?
Is he hot?

15:04.520 --> 15:09.071
<i>I know it's a cliché but sailors say</i>
<i>it is the calm before the storm</i>

15:09.160 --> 15:11.754
<i>that lets you know the danger's coming.</i>

15:17.840 --> 15:21.310
First off, let me just say thank you.

15:21.400 --> 15:24.073
For the last couple of months
I have been adrift

15:24.160 --> 15:29.439
in a sea of puppy dogs, lollipops
and, let's face it, mediocre metaphors.

15:29.520 --> 15:33.991
You people were kind enough
to piss all over learning a procedure

15:34.080 --> 15:38.039
that could determine
whether some poor sucker lives or dies.

15:38.120 --> 15:43.990
And that reminded me of something
that I wanted to remind you of.

15:44.080 --> 15:48.119
Because you see, I am accountable.

15:48.200 --> 15:53.149
I am accountable for the continuous,
crashing, undeniable amateurism

15:53.240 --> 15:57.836
that you people drag into this hospital,
day in and day out.

15:57.920 --> 16:02.357
And believe me, the next time
one of you perpetual disappointments

16:02.440 --> 16:05.079
doesn't even have the common decency

16:05.160 --> 16:09.119
to try and do better
at something you supposedly do,

16:10.160 --> 16:13.709
I will toss your sorry ass
out of here in about ten seconds

16:13.800 --> 16:16.678
and then I will forget you forever
in the next five.

16:20.160 --> 16:24.676
OK, Nervous Guy, bring that nervous butt
up here, lose the shirt,

16:24.760 --> 16:27.479
we're gonna show these people
how this thing works.

16:31.520 --> 16:33.397
- Nice tan there, champ.
- Thanks.

16:33.480 --> 16:34.469
Clear.

16:38.040 --> 16:42.158
<i>After Cox exploded at us, so many</i>
<i>thoughts are racing through my head.</i>

16:42.240 --> 16:47.109
<i>We have been slacking off lately.</i>
<i>How did Doug get such incredible abs?</i>

16:47.200 --> 16:50.033
<i>And what the hell</i>
<i>is the deal with Danni?</i>

16:51.960 --> 16:57.592
After you dressed up Rowdy, did you trim
the clumpy areas around his butt?

16:57.680 --> 16:58.669
Yeah.

17:00.160 --> 17:03.357
Thanks.
He was due for a good grooming.

17:04.800 --> 17:07.108
- Look...
- Just tell me why.

17:07.200 --> 17:09.953
- Your cell phone wasn't turned off.
- What?

17:10.040 --> 17:12.190
When you called me.

17:12.280 --> 17:15.750
Actually, I'm swamped, Danni.
Sorry, I gotta go.

17:17.640 --> 17:19.517
Elliot, what's wrong?

17:21.119 --> 17:23.076
Oh, forget it, you're busy.

17:23.160 --> 17:26.038
<i>Come on, I always have time for you.</i>

17:26.119 --> 17:29.795
That stupid phone. That's how
Turk found out I collect scarves.

17:33.000 --> 17:37.039
You're still not over Elliot
and until you are,

17:37.120 --> 17:40.749
no one's ever gonna have a chance
to get close to you. Right?

17:43.920 --> 17:47.629
That silence,
that's you breaking up with me.

17:53.840 --> 17:55.796
<i>I finally broke up with someone.</i>

18:11.760 --> 18:13.955
- How are you doing, Elliot?
- Great.

18:14.040 --> 18:17.350
I spend my life in a place
filled with misery and sickness.

18:17.440 --> 18:20.671
If I need to feel good about myself,
the hell with everybody.

18:20.760 --> 18:24.309
I think you look beautiful.
I wouldn't change a thing.

18:25.840 --> 18:27.831
I did tone down
the eye make-up a bit.

18:27.920 --> 18:30.150
Oh, thank God! You looked so slu <i>tty</i>.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.877
There. All done.

18:38.200 --> 18:40.509
I look hot.

18:41.320 --> 18:44.869
<i>Eve</i> ry <i>body has their own way</i>
<i>of getting through the day.</i>

18:49.600 --> 18:52.956
<i>For some, it's as simple</i>
<i>as standing up for a friend.</i>

18:53.680 --> 18:55.796
<i>And getting away with it.</i>

18:58.200 --> 19:00.634
<i>For others, it's talking things out.</i>

19:00.720 --> 19:03.757
I know what you're thinking.
Believe me, I do.

19:04.840 --> 19:08.719
Why would a civilized, uptown man
of the millennium such as myself

19:08.800 --> 19:11.109
even go ahead and give a good rat's ass

19:11.200 --> 19:16.752
about whether a bunch of snot-nosed,
baby docs were afraid of him, right?

19:16.840 --> 19:23.234
Well, unfortunately the only way
I know how to teach is through fear.

19:23.320 --> 19:26.392
And I tell you this because I know

19:26.480 --> 19:31.554
that this particular shortcoming
will invariably affect your life.

19:34.960 --> 19:40.239
And again, sorry about the gay sailor's
outfit. Your mother loves it.

19:40.320 --> 19:42.914
She couldn't be more pleasant
when you have it on.

19:43.000 --> 19:46.390
Take it off, nut bag.
Put it on, pleasant, approachable.

19:50.960 --> 19:52.678
<i>As for me, if I'm not over Elliot,</i>

19:52.760 --> 19:55.194
<i>I might as well wait it out</i>
<i>for the long haul.</i>

19:55.280 --> 19:58.397
<i>But I'm not gonna ignore opportunity</i>
<i>if it falls in my lap.</i>

19:58.480 --> 19:59.993
Hey, Sheila.

20:00.080 --> 20:02.150
- Leave me alone.
- OK.

20:02.240 --> 20:06.119
JD, let's get going. Sean's calling me
at home in ten minutes.

20:06.200 --> 20:08.350
<i>Oh, this is gonna suck.</i>
