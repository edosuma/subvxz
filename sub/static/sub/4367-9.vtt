00:01.774 --> 00:03.007
You are being watched.

00:03.009 --> 00:06.427
The government has a secret system...

00:06.429 --> 00:10.732
a machine that spies on you
every hour of every day.

00:10.734 --> 00:13.351
I designed the machine
to detect acts of terror,

00:13.353 --> 00:15.069
but it sees everything...

00:15.071 --> 00:18.323
violent crimes
involving ordinary people.

00:18.325 --> 00:20.975
The government considers
these people irrelevant.

00:20.977 --> 00:23.578
We don't.

00:23.580 --> 00:28.216
Hunted by the authorities,
we work in secret.

00:28.218 --> 00:30.418
You will never find us.

00:30.420 --> 00:32.253
But victim or perpetrator,

00:32.255 --> 00:35.757
if your number's up, we'll find you.

00:43.216 --> 00:45.567
You want to make $500?

00:45.569 --> 00:48.436
Give me your number, circle the block,

00:48.438 --> 00:52.890
wait for my call.

01:07.072 --> 01:09.290
You got eyes
on our new number yet, Finch?

01:09.292 --> 01:10.959
I believe I do.

01:10.961 --> 01:14.012
Fermin Ordoz. Age 38.
Born in Cuba.

01:14.014 --> 01:17.015
One of New York's 42,000 cab drivers.

01:17.017 --> 01:18.266
Never paid a bill late,

01:18.268 --> 01:19.684
and most Americans would be jealous

01:19.686 --> 01:21.135
of his credit score.

01:21.137 --> 01:22.470
But yesterday, he emptied out

01:22.472 --> 01:24.806
every last dime
from his savings account.

01:24.808 --> 01:26.107
Could be in trouble.

01:26.109 --> 01:28.109
Or he's about to get into some.

01:28.111 --> 01:30.612
Considering that cab drivers
are 30 times more likely

01:30.614 --> 01:33.114
to be killed on the job
than most other professions,

01:33.116 --> 01:35.900
we'd better keep a close eye on him.

01:35.902 --> 01:37.318
[Whistles]

01:37.320 --> 01:39.037
[Over radio]
Again, last night's star...

01:39.039 --> 01:40.605
Because you really never know

01:40.607 --> 01:45.326
who's going to step into his cab.

01:45.328 --> 01:48.663
- Where to?
- 25th and Broadway.

01:48.665 --> 01:49.947
But please don't rush.

01:49.949 --> 01:51.282
I get carsick quite easily.

01:51.284 --> 01:52.748
Uh, in case you do,

01:52.749 --> 01:54.669
there's paper towels
underneath the seat, yeah?

01:54.671 --> 01:57.555
Thank you.

01:59.842 --> 02:02.393
Fermin Ordoz.

02:02.395 --> 02:04.095
Defected from Cuba in '05.

02:04.097 --> 02:05.796
Drafted as a top pitching prospect,

02:05.798 --> 02:07.265
till he tore a ligament in his arm

02:07.267 --> 02:09.400
in double-A ball in '07.

02:09.401 --> 02:10.985
[Softly] A shame about his arm.

02:10.987 --> 02:14.022
By all accounts,
he had a wicked curveball.

02:14.024 --> 02:15.356
Till life threw him one.

02:15.358 --> 02:17.575
From Major League prospect
to nobody hack.

02:17.577 --> 02:20.278
No doubt, a difficult life transition.

02:20.280 --> 02:24.282
Let's see what else we can find out.

02:26.182 --> 02:27.592
_

02:29.788 --> 02:31.039
I know you'd rather fiddle

02:31.041 --> 02:33.068
with the onboard
computer system, Finch,

02:33.069 --> 02:34.509
but why not try a little small talk?

02:34.511 --> 02:37.512
A little patience,
Mr. Reese.

02:37.514 --> 02:39.764
Are you talking to me?

02:39.766 --> 02:42.110
Yes, actually,
I heard about the cab driver

02:42.111 --> 02:43.551
that got robbed by his own passenger

02:43.553 --> 02:45.053
on 11th Avenue last week.

02:45.055 --> 02:46.554
Terrible business.

02:46.556 --> 02:48.356
Yeah, you got to be careful
who you pick up.

02:48.357 --> 02:50.558
Must be tough dealing
with complete strangers

02:50.560 --> 02:51.809
getting in your car every day.

02:51.811 --> 02:53.144
Sometimes.

02:53.146 --> 02:54.866
When I look in the mirror
at my passenger,

02:54.867 --> 02:56.227
I never know if I'm driving around

02:56.228 --> 02:57.588
a good guy or a bad guy, you know?

02:57.589 --> 02:58.933
I can only imagine.

02:58.935 --> 03:01.319
Must make you a good judge
of character, though.

03:01.321 --> 03:04.238
What do you make of me?

03:04.240 --> 03:05.690
That's a nice suit.

03:05.692 --> 03:07.525
But not too flashy.

03:07.527 --> 03:09.243
Except for the pocket square.

03:09.245 --> 03:13.531
But you're polite, neat, a thinker.

03:13.533 --> 03:15.032
The vest...

03:15.034 --> 03:17.969
I don't know,
maybe, uh, a professor or...

03:17.971 --> 03:19.887
I know.
A librarian, maybe?

03:19.889 --> 03:23.874
Why, yes.
Of a sort.

03:29.682 --> 03:30.715
Keep the change.

03:30.717 --> 03:31.816
Really?

03:31.818 --> 03:35.653
Thank you.

03:38.657 --> 03:40.491
[Cab door shuts]
We've got sound, video,

03:40.493 --> 03:42.694
and GPS in the cab,
Mr. Reese.

03:42.696 --> 03:45.730
Stay close to him.

03:45.732 --> 03:46.948
The threat could come

03:46.950 --> 03:48.399
from any one of 8 million people

03:48.401 --> 03:49.667
in this city.

03:49.669 --> 03:53.571
I'm right on him.

03:53.573 --> 03:55.590
I'm using Ordoz's cell to piggyback

03:55.592 --> 03:57.542
on any phone that enters his cab.

03:57.544 --> 03:59.377
I know who that bitch is.

03:59.379 --> 04:01.345
Nobody does that to me.

04:01.347 --> 04:02.714
He's a dead man.

04:02.716 --> 04:04.849
I remember when this
was farmland over here.

04:04.851 --> 04:08.102
I used to shoot rabbits
down there, 20 feet away.

04:08.104 --> 04:11.189
Quite a cast of characters
in the back of Fermin's cab.

04:11.191 --> 04:13.057
And not all of them appear to be sober.

04:13.059 --> 04:15.977
Hey, amigo,

04:15.979 --> 04:17.695
turn on the ball game.

04:17.697 --> 04:19.914
Sorry, no baseball game.

04:19.916 --> 04:22.233
What do you mean?
Game's on right now.

04:22.235 --> 04:23.434
- 880 AM.
- I can't.

04:23.436 --> 04:24.452
The radio's broken.

04:24.454 --> 04:25.870
Come on, man!

04:25.872 --> 04:27.655
Just put on the game!

04:27.657 --> 04:31.159
One more time,
we're gonna have a real problem.

04:31.161 --> 04:32.443
[Thud]

04:32.445 --> 04:34.245
[Tires screeching]

04:34.247 --> 04:35.946
Hey!

04:35.948 --> 04:39.667
You owe me money!

04:39.669 --> 04:42.787
Hey!

04:42.789 --> 04:45.673
I can't tell if Ordoz
has more of an issue

04:45.675 --> 04:49.310
with drunks, his car radio,
or the game of baseball.

04:49.312 --> 04:50.728
After what happened to his arm,

04:50.730 --> 04:52.346
he probably just wants to tune it out.

04:52.348 --> 04:55.933
Looking into every passenger
that gets into his cab...

04:55.935 --> 04:58.803
it's impossible.

05:00.189 --> 05:01.806
No priors.

05:01.808 --> 05:03.968
No complaints from the
taxi and limousine commission.

05:03.969 --> 05:06.027
I'm sending you his GPS logs

05:06.029 --> 05:07.361
for the last 36 hours.

05:07.363 --> 05:09.197
His GPS logs?
[Chuckles]

05:09.199 --> 05:10.328
Which I'm sure you obtained

05:10.329 --> 05:11.649
by submitting an official request

05:11.651 --> 05:12.784
to the TLC.

05:12.786 --> 05:13.986
Not quite.

05:13.987 --> 05:15.467
But if it would make you feel better,

05:15.468 --> 05:16.708
I could hack into their network

05:16.709 --> 05:17.829
and make it look like I did.

05:17.831 --> 05:19.271
It would only take me a few minutes.

05:19.272 --> 05:20.508
Never mind.

05:20.510 --> 05:22.270
I'll check it
with the daily crime blotter,

05:22.271 --> 05:24.045
let you know if anything pops.

05:24.047 --> 05:26.013
Forever in your debt, Detective.

05:26.015 --> 05:28.135
Oh, and how did your date go
with Detective Beecher?

05:28.136 --> 05:29.667
Sounded like it really went well.

05:29.669 --> 05:32.336
[Beep]

05:34.312 --> 05:37.303
_

05:41.098 --> 05:43.826
_

05:46.351 --> 05:48.236
I just got word from Elias.

05:48.238 --> 05:50.404
He says no more business with with HR.

05:50.406 --> 05:52.824
Most of them are either dead
or in jail anyway.

05:52.826 --> 05:54.041
At this point,

05:54.043 --> 05:56.360
you got to wonder who's even left.

06:01.750 --> 06:04.902
FBI investigation's wrapping up.

06:04.904 --> 06:07.338
My fed contact says
Donnelly's been crowing

06:07.340 --> 06:09.140
about burying HR.

06:09.142 --> 06:10.641
And yet, here we are.

06:10.643 --> 06:13.311
Still, we have a larger problem.

06:13.313 --> 06:15.813
No one's gonna open
their mouth about us.

06:15.815 --> 06:17.481
I made sure of that.

06:17.483 --> 06:19.183
Make no mistake, my friend.

06:19.185 --> 06:20.501
We are just businessmen,

06:20.503 --> 06:23.387
and businesses run on money, revenue.

06:23.389 --> 06:25.323
That's gonna take some time.

06:25.325 --> 06:27.191
We need to read in some new talent.

06:27.193 --> 06:28.442
Rebuild.

06:28.444 --> 06:30.194
We made a tactical error

06:30.196 --> 06:32.830
turning our back on Elias.

06:32.832 --> 06:35.583
Even from jail, he is
the de facto boss of the city.

06:35.585 --> 06:38.035
We need his backing
in order to operate.

06:38.037 --> 06:40.004
That might be problematic.

06:40.006 --> 06:42.072
Set a meeting.

06:42.074 --> 06:43.674
Time we make peace, get us walking

06:43.676 --> 06:47.628
on the same path again
for our mutual benefit.

06:47.630 --> 06:50.481
And a suggestion.

06:50.483 --> 06:53.434
Should this meeting take
a less than cordial turn...

06:53.436 --> 06:56.938
Don't worry.
I'll bring some backup.

07:02.694 --> 07:04.528
[Phone dialing, line trilling]

07:04.530 --> 07:07.565
Detective Fusco, it's your lucky day.

07:07.567 --> 07:09.867
I'm calling in a chip.

07:09.869 --> 07:13.404
We're gonna set up a meet,
talk to Elias' guys.

07:24.466 --> 07:26.801
Fermin's taking a pit stop, Finch.

07:26.803 --> 07:28.636
- Aziz.
- Fermin.

07:28.638 --> 07:30.755
Hey, man.
Do you have it?

07:30.757 --> 07:32.556
Yeah, I told you I'd find
a buyer for it.

07:32.558 --> 07:34.625
Good, I need it.
I'm on my way over there now.

07:34.627 --> 07:38.596
All right.

07:38.598 --> 07:41.131
800 for the laptop.

07:41.133 --> 07:42.132
You don't trust me?

07:42.134 --> 07:44.151
Not at all.

07:44.153 --> 07:47.355
[Laughs nervously] Okay.

07:47.357 --> 07:49.407
Thank you.

07:49.409 --> 07:52.493
- Thank you so much, man.
- Good luck, my friend.

08:01.787 --> 08:03.671
Finch, I think I know what happened

08:03.673 --> 08:05.656
to our cabbie's savings.

08:05.658 --> 08:09.994
He's carrying it all
around with him right now.

08:09.996 --> 08:11.712
We must have overlooked something.

08:11.714 --> 08:12.964
Does he have gambling debts?

08:12.966 --> 08:16.217
Is he dealing drugs?

08:16.219 --> 08:19.503
Whatever it is, it's about to go down.

08:26.695 --> 08:28.863
Looks like he's about to buy something,

08:28.865 --> 08:31.148
or buy his way out of a big hole.

08:35.520 --> 08:36.787
Uh, Senor Mendoza.

08:36.789 --> 08:38.539
Fermin.

08:38.541 --> 08:40.557
_

08:41.602 --> 08:44.806
_

08:46.548 --> 08:51.702
Do they, uh...
have a safe way to get here?

08:53.371 --> 08:56.674
This is the last photo I have
of my wife and son.

09:00.979 --> 09:04.432
We have a slight problem, Fermin.

09:04.434 --> 09:06.484
The price has gone up.

09:06.486 --> 09:08.602
What do you mean?

09:08.604 --> 09:10.938
I mean, you only have enough money

09:10.940 --> 09:12.723
for Maria or Jorge, but not both.

09:12.725 --> 09:13.941
No.

09:13.943 --> 09:18.195
Senor Mendoza, don't do this.

09:18.197 --> 09:20.748
You know it is not safe
for them in Cuba anymore.

09:20.750 --> 09:22.917
Maria says that the neighbors
are getting curious.

09:22.919 --> 09:24.952
They sense that she and Jorge
are leaving soon.

09:24.954 --> 09:26.754
If an official finds out,

09:26.756 --> 09:28.372
they will arrest her on suspicion.

09:28.374 --> 09:30.591
Fermin, we've known each other
for how long?

09:30.593 --> 09:33.844
I helped you
when everybody stopped caring.

09:33.846 --> 09:36.347
Put you back on your feet
after the surgery

09:36.349 --> 09:38.299
when your career was over.

09:38.301 --> 09:41.519
These are prices I do not control.

09:41.521 --> 09:44.355
But how am I supposed to come up
with another $40,000?

09:44.357 --> 09:49.060
It's the land of opportunity,
my friend.

09:49.062 --> 09:51.862
You'll find a way.

09:54.149 --> 09:57.234
Ordoz is a desperate man, Finch.

09:57.236 --> 09:59.703
Pushing around his cab
for the past five years,

09:59.705 --> 10:02.606
saving up to bring his wife
and his kid here.

10:02.608 --> 10:05.443
Sounds like he just came up short.

10:05.445 --> 10:07.878
Who knows what he'd be willing to do

10:07.880 --> 10:10.047
to get his family back?

10:23.322 --> 10:25.657
I hacked the Cuban Government database.

10:25.659 --> 10:27.959
Surprisingly sophisticated software.

10:27.961 --> 10:30.495
No doubt, courtesy of the Russians.

10:30.497 --> 10:33.415
Don't tell me
Fidel Castro's really dead.

10:33.417 --> 10:34.532
Actually, yes.

10:34.534 --> 10:37.719
And his body double has cancer.

10:37.721 --> 10:39.971
The Cubans keep a file
on every defector.

10:39.973 --> 10:43.124
Apparently, Ordoz pitched
for the Cuban national team

10:43.126 --> 10:44.976
from 2000 to 2005,

10:44.978 --> 10:47.095
when he defected to the US.

10:47.097 --> 10:49.964
Wanted a better life
for his wife and child.

10:49.966 --> 10:53.134
Cuba was a surveillance state
long before the advent

10:53.136 --> 10:56.237
of security cameras
and digital networking.

10:56.239 --> 10:58.073
If they catch his family
trying to defect,

10:58.075 --> 10:59.491
his wife can go to prison.

10:59.493 --> 11:01.409
Explains why Ordoz is so desperate

11:01.411 --> 11:03.528
to get his family out of there.

11:03.530 --> 11:05.780
Desperate times call
for desperate measures.

11:05.782 --> 11:08.649
Stay close, Mr. Reese.

11:13.172 --> 11:15.090
Ordoz turned off his sign.

11:15.092 --> 11:16.657
He's not looking for a fare.

11:16.659 --> 11:18.593
So who's he waiting for?

11:18.595 --> 11:21.179
Acosta! Acosta!
Over here, man!

11:21.181 --> 11:23.882
Look over here, Acosta!
Beautiful family!

11:23.884 --> 11:26.684
Rafael Acosta.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.553
Plays second base for New York.

11:28.555 --> 11:30.138
Rafael Acosta?
Of course.

11:30.140 --> 11:31.806
They defected together in '05.

11:31.808 --> 11:34.142
Escaped from a hotel room
in the Netherlands

11:34.144 --> 11:36.311
during an international
baseball tournament.

11:36.313 --> 11:38.446
Acosta... he's having
a pretty good year.

11:38.448 --> 11:40.115
Career year, Mr. Reese.

11:40.117 --> 11:41.633
He's top ten in OPS among infielders

11:41.635 --> 11:43.201
for the last three.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.353
You're a baseball
reference machine, Finch.

11:45.355 --> 11:46.404
You should get out more,

11:46.406 --> 11:48.289
take in a game once in a while.

11:48.291 --> 11:49.491
Who says I don't?

11:49.493 --> 11:54.212
Hey, Raffi.

11:54.214 --> 11:57.675
_

11:58.153 --> 11:59.688
_

11:59.804 --> 12:03.172
_

12:03.173 --> 12:05.205
_

12:05.315 --> 12:06.343
Yeah.

12:06.596 --> 12:08.009
How's the shoulder, man?

12:08.011 --> 12:09.928
Uh, it's okay.

12:09.930 --> 12:12.547
Look, man,
I-I hate to ask,

12:12.549 --> 12:14.232
but, you see, I, uh...

12:14.234 --> 12:16.484
I just need a little help
with <i>mi familia,</i> you know?

12:16.486 --> 12:18.520
Oh, yeah, yeah.

12:18.522 --> 12:20.071
Of course, uh...

12:20.073 --> 12:21.656
How are they?

12:21.658 --> 12:23.224
I don't really know, Raffi.

12:23.226 --> 12:24.993
You know, I haven't...

12:24.995 --> 12:26.444
I haven't seen them in a long time.

12:26.446 --> 12:29.164
I'm still trying
to get them out of there.

12:29.166 --> 12:31.732
Here you are, man.

12:31.734 --> 12:34.068
Just, uh, <i>toma.</i>

12:34.070 --> 12:37.455
Take that.

12:37.457 --> 12:39.207
Good luck, Fermie, okay?

12:39.209 --> 12:43.077
Baby, let's go.

12:44.713 --> 12:48.216
Acosta ended up with
the life Ordoz could have had.

12:48.218 --> 12:51.719
Now he just wants his family back.

12:56.041 --> 12:58.443
Detective, the meeting with Elias' guys

12:58.445 --> 12:59.894
is on for this morning.

12:59.896 --> 13:03.398
- We'll come and pick you up.
- Count me out.

13:03.400 --> 13:05.433
You got one too many skeletons
in the closet

13:05.435 --> 13:07.068
to be calling the shots here.

13:07.070 --> 13:09.437
Not to mention,
a couple buried in the ground.

13:09.439 --> 13:11.873
But they can always be dug up.

13:11.875 --> 13:14.209
Fine, I'll be there.

13:14.211 --> 13:16.077
You don't need me for this.

13:16.079 --> 13:17.879
You got youngblood recruit
right over there.

13:17.881 --> 13:19.241
Have him twist a few arms for you.

13:19.242 --> 13:22.500
Elias knows how to hold a grudge.

13:22.502 --> 13:24.669
You're here because
if this thing goes sideways,

13:24.671 --> 13:28.306
these guys are gonna want
something to shoot.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.258
That's comforting.

13:33.896 --> 13:35.796
Gotta say...

13:35.798 --> 13:37.815
took some balls,
calling a meeting like this.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.434
In the shape HR is in,

13:39.436 --> 13:41.769
I'm not quite sure
what you have to offer anymore.

13:41.771 --> 13:43.655
Just your goodwill.

13:43.657 --> 13:45.577
Your boss wanted the heads
of the five families

13:45.578 --> 13:46.908
on a stick.

13:46.910 --> 13:50.662
Grifoni's the only one that got away.

13:50.664 --> 13:52.780
Last I checked,
he was in Witness Protection.

13:52.782 --> 13:55.316
And on the back of this photo...

13:55.318 --> 13:57.619
his alias and present address

13:57.621 --> 13:59.420
in nowheresville, suburbia.

13:59.422 --> 14:03.541
And in exchange, you want what?

14:03.543 --> 14:07.161
Elias' support in rebuilding HR.

14:10.299 --> 14:11.933
[Phone dialing]

14:11.935 --> 14:15.169
Hey, it's me.
I'm at the meeting.

14:15.171 --> 14:19.057
So here's the deal.

14:23.979 --> 14:26.347
The boss accepts your offer...

14:26.349 --> 14:28.449
on one condition.

14:28.451 --> 14:31.486
We're not interested
in going out and getting him.

14:31.488 --> 14:35.123
The boss says you bring Grifoni to us.

14:35.125 --> 14:39.794
Then all is forgiven.

14:39.796 --> 14:41.996
Consider it done.

14:56.178 --> 14:58.096
Okay, cabbie,

14:58.098 --> 15:00.098
what were you doing here last night

15:00.100 --> 15:03.384
for 25 minutes?

15:03.386 --> 15:04.852
Carter!

15:04.854 --> 15:06.771
Whoa, now this party's
really blowing up.

15:06.773 --> 15:07.739
Who called you?

15:07.741 --> 15:09.240
Nobody.
I was 10/6.

15:09.242 --> 15:11.659
But you look kind of lost
out here, Terney.

15:11.661 --> 15:13.741
- What's the story?
- I wish someone would tell me.

15:13.742 --> 15:16.197
What we got is, uh...

15:16.199 --> 15:17.782
this guy.

15:17.784 --> 15:20.067
Seems like he's been dead
about nine hours.

15:20.069 --> 15:21.402
Multiple gunshot wounds.

15:21.404 --> 15:22.884
No ID.
Just the clothes on his back.

15:22.885 --> 15:24.956
Who are the suits?
[Laughs]

15:24.958 --> 15:26.341
Secret Service.

15:26.343 --> 15:27.875
I don't know who tipped 'em off,

15:27.877 --> 15:29.377
but they were all over that body

15:29.379 --> 15:33.297
the minute we called it in.

15:35.718 --> 15:39.920
Detective Carter, Homicide Task Force.

15:39.922 --> 15:41.139
Call you back.

15:41.141 --> 15:43.975
Agent Regina Vickers, Secret Service.

15:43.977 --> 15:45.426
We got an ID on the body?

15:45.428 --> 15:47.595
No offense, but this case
is "need to know."

15:47.597 --> 15:48.929
No offense taken.

15:48.931 --> 15:50.651
But, uh, if a body drops
in New York City,

15:50.652 --> 15:54.202
we're gonna have to ID it.

15:54.204 --> 15:56.454
Vadim Pushkov, Russian national.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.322
What we're mainly concerned with

15:58.324 --> 15:59.874
is if he had anything on his person.

15:59.876 --> 16:02.860
Has anything turned up yet?
A laptop? A phone?

16:02.862 --> 16:05.213
Well, just some receipts,

16:05.215 --> 16:07.081
and, uh... and this.

16:07.083 --> 16:09.000
Makes you wonder
where the other half went.

16:09.002 --> 16:10.618
But we'll keep combing the area.

16:10.620 --> 16:13.721
He buys a pizza bagel
at JFK yesterday afternoon

16:13.723 --> 16:15.757
and winds up dead in Morningside Park

16:15.759 --> 16:17.925
at 2:00 AM with no luggage.

16:17.927 --> 16:19.427
Any idea how he got here?

16:19.429 --> 16:21.179
Town car? Cab?

16:21.181 --> 16:23.130
Maybe if we find out
who drove him here,

16:23.132 --> 16:24.348
we could find the shooter.

16:24.350 --> 16:26.184
Or a witness.

16:26.186 --> 16:28.426
You canvass the area and
we'll check the security cams.

16:28.427 --> 16:30.938
We find that car,
we'll find out who did this.

16:30.940 --> 16:33.107
[Cell phone rings] Excuse me.

16:33.109 --> 16:34.659
[Beep] Vickers here.

16:34.661 --> 16:36.160
Hello, Detective.

16:36.162 --> 16:38.696
So, GPS put your driver
at Morningside Park

16:38.698 --> 16:40.748
for a window of 25 minutes last night,

16:40.750 --> 16:43.150
right around the time

16:43.152 --> 16:47.422
some Russian guy succumbs
to acute lead poisoning.

16:47.424 --> 16:50.458
And you think our cab driver
is connected to this homicide?

16:50.460 --> 16:51.959
Figured you could tell me.

16:51.961 --> 16:54.161
Along with, why are
the Secret Service crawling

16:54.163 --> 16:55.296
all over this investigation?

16:55.298 --> 16:56.964
I have no idea.

16:56.966 --> 16:59.500
But whatever you can find out
would be much appreciated.

16:59.502 --> 17:00.879
Unlikely,

17:00.880 --> 17:02.520
considering they're
about as forthcoming

17:02.522 --> 17:04.505
with information as you are.

17:04.507 --> 17:07.692
I'll see what I can find out.

17:14.366 --> 17:16.200
[Car door opens]

17:18.369 --> 17:20.488
So what do we know
about the dead Russian

17:20.490 --> 17:22.205
in the park, Finch?

17:22.208 --> 17:23.741
Vadim Pushkov.

17:23.742 --> 17:25.409
If the Secret Service is involved,

17:25.411 --> 17:27.627
he's likely some kind
of international criminal.

17:27.630 --> 17:32.583
Seems like our cabbie gave
the wrong guy a ride last night.

17:34.753 --> 17:37.221
Take the 59th Street bridge
into Queens.

17:37.223 --> 17:38.840
Do you have an address?

17:38.842 --> 17:41.058
No address.

17:41.060 --> 17:44.428
Just go.

17:44.430 --> 17:46.514
I can't seem to access
this woman's phone.

17:46.516 --> 17:49.734
Either she doesn't have one,
or it's currently turned off.

17:55.107 --> 17:59.193
They're taking the bridge into Queens.

17:59.195 --> 18:00.862
Now take this all the way down

18:00.864 --> 18:04.665
and make a right on Vernon.

18:04.667 --> 18:07.902
Got a bad feeling about this, Finch.

18:07.904 --> 18:09.403
Turn right up here.

18:09.405 --> 18:12.406
Strange place for her to be going.

18:20.299 --> 18:22.350
One-way street
that bottlenecks down the way.

18:22.352 --> 18:26.470
This is good right here.

18:26.472 --> 18:28.589
They're stopped
in the middle of the block.

18:28.591 --> 18:30.057
She's isolated him, Finch.

18:30.059 --> 18:32.276
Uh, $11.50.

18:37.533 --> 18:39.099
First, a few questions.

18:39.101 --> 18:40.701
Excuse me?

18:40.703 --> 18:43.204
A friend of mine
was in your cab last night.

18:43.206 --> 18:47.107
Do you recognize him?

18:47.109 --> 18:49.627
Uh, I see a lot of people...

18:49.629 --> 18:50.795
every day.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.780
Pushkov.
You drove him.

18:52.782 --> 18:55.283
Did he leave anything behind?

18:55.285 --> 18:57.952
Do not lie to me.

18:57.954 --> 18:58.970
Look, lady,

18:58.972 --> 19:00.788
I turn in the cab every night.

19:00.790 --> 19:02.924
Uh, if someone did leave
anything in here,

19:02.926 --> 19:03.958
I didn't find it.

19:03.960 --> 19:07.595
[Phone dials]

19:07.597 --> 19:10.481

19:14.269 --> 19:16.971
[Car door opens]

19:23.829 --> 19:25.746
[Car door opens]

19:25.748 --> 19:28.416
Sorry, I'm not in service.

19:28.418 --> 19:29.917
Here's the thing.

19:29.919 --> 19:31.679
You're gonna want
to give me a lift anyway.

19:31.681 --> 19:33.481
Listen, I'm having
a pretty lousy day, okay?

19:33.482 --> 19:34.956
You mind, uh, just getting out?

19:34.958 --> 19:37.258
I'm afraid it's gonna get
a whole lot worse, Fermin.

19:37.260 --> 19:39.176
[Gun clicks] I don't want any trouble.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.738
Unfortunately, you and I don't
have much to say on that matter.

19:41.739 --> 19:43.347
Now listen up.

19:43.349 --> 19:45.189
We're about ready
to be boxed in by two cars.

19:45.190 --> 19:46.968
Four to six shooters.

19:46.970 --> 19:49.353
I want you to aim for the rear
quarter panel of their car,

19:49.355 --> 19:52.773
and don't let off the gas,
you got that?

19:52.775 --> 19:54.809
Now's a good time, Fermin.

19:54.811 --> 19:57.511
- Wait, what?
- Now, Fermin.

19:57.513 --> 19:59.397
[Tires screeching]

20:05.654 --> 20:08.205
Mr. Reese, are you okay?

20:08.207 --> 20:09.624
I'm fine, Finch.

20:09.626 --> 20:11.709
But I think
the real threat just found us.

20:23.570 --> 20:25.237
What the hell is going on?

20:25.239 --> 20:27.072
Who are those people?

20:27.074 --> 20:29.208
Mr. Reese, the blonde
who led him into the trap

20:29.210 --> 20:31.627
made a call just after leaving the cab.

20:31.629 --> 20:32.961
I can't quite make it out.

20:32.963 --> 20:34.012
[Female voice murmuring]

20:34.014 --> 20:35.614
But I believe it's Estonian.

20:35.616 --> 20:37.249
Estonian mob.

20:37.251 --> 20:38.667
I recognize their methods.

20:38.669 --> 20:40.385
It was a kill box.

20:40.387 --> 20:42.738
Had a similar experience in Russia.

20:42.740 --> 20:44.873
Didn't work out too well for them.

20:44.875 --> 20:46.541
[Grunts]

20:46.543 --> 20:48.810
Disabled the GPS.

20:48.812 --> 20:51.313
Can't risk them accessing it
to track you down.

20:51.315 --> 20:54.433
Who are you?

20:54.435 --> 20:56.551
Just a guy who needed a ride.

20:56.553 --> 20:58.391
That woman asked

20:58.392 --> 21:00.072
about a passenger
in your cab last night.

21:00.074 --> 21:01.940
His name is Pushkov.
What happened to him?

21:01.942 --> 21:03.191
I don't know this Pushkov!

21:03.193 --> 21:04.993
I'm just a cab driver!

21:04.995 --> 21:08.530
What, you're gonna lie to me
like you lied to that woman?

21:08.532 --> 21:10.949
There's a big difference here, Fermin.

21:10.951 --> 21:13.001
I'm the only one who can
help you, you understand?

21:13.003 --> 21:14.620
So why are you helping me?

21:14.622 --> 21:16.905
Maybe you're an honest guy
who just made a mistake.

21:16.907 --> 21:19.067
But you need to decide
whether your life's worth more

21:19.068 --> 21:21.076
than whatever that guy left
in your cab.

21:25.515 --> 21:27.415
Okay.

21:27.417 --> 21:29.301
I picked this guy up
near the airport, huh?

21:29.303 --> 21:32.020
We drove around for a while.
He seemed nervous.

21:32.022 --> 21:33.755
He spoke in Russian on his cell phone.

21:33.757 --> 21:35.724
- You understand Russian?
- A little.

21:35.726 --> 21:37.759
My grandfather spoke it
when I was a kid in Cuba.

21:37.761 --> 21:40.112
It sounded like he was trying
to sell something.

21:40.114 --> 21:42.531
He called it, uh, "H-said,"

21:42.533 --> 21:44.766
or... or... or "travelers."

21:44.768 --> 21:46.952
I didn't know
what he was talking about.

21:46.954 --> 21:49.074
That blonde lady said
he left something in your cab.

21:49.075 --> 21:51.206
What was it?

21:52.709 --> 21:53.789
I'm not a cop here, Fermin,

21:53.790 --> 21:55.590
but if you want my help,
you need to tell me

21:55.591 --> 21:58.046
what he left in your cab.

21:58.048 --> 22:00.132
He left a laptop.

22:00.134 --> 22:01.616
He left it underneath the seat.

22:01.618 --> 22:02.884
He must have forgot.

22:02.886 --> 22:04.886
What'd you do with it?

22:04.888 --> 22:06.788
I sold it...

22:06.790 --> 22:09.958
to a friend for money.

22:09.960 --> 22:12.728
Look, I never do that, but...

22:12.730 --> 22:14.313
I drive him around all day

22:14.315 --> 22:15.764
and then he stiffed me on the tab.

22:15.766 --> 22:18.650
- Finch, are you there?
- Always, Mr. Reese.

22:18.652 --> 22:20.635
Sounds like this Pushkov had
some kind of a deal

22:20.637 --> 22:22.404
to sell the laptop to the Estonians.

22:22.406 --> 22:23.972
But then he leaves it in the cab?

22:23.974 --> 22:25.357
He knew it would be dangerous.

22:25.359 --> 22:27.075
He wanted to negotiate a higher price.

22:27.077 --> 22:31.446
Clearly, the Estonians
were in no mood to negotiate.

22:31.448 --> 22:33.648
What in the world could be
on that laptop?

22:33.650 --> 22:36.168
- Who are you talking to?
- My business partner.

22:36.170 --> 22:38.253
Estonians don't care
if he doesn't have the laptop.

22:38.255 --> 22:40.175
They'll kill him
just because he knew about it.

22:40.176 --> 22:41.256
Just because of a laptop?

22:41.258 --> 22:43.463
Because of what was on it,
and getting it back

22:43.464 --> 22:45.544
may be the only leverage we have
to keep you alive.

22:45.546 --> 22:48.597
Let's start
with the friend you sold it to.

23:08.234 --> 23:11.653
Finch, looks like the Estonians
have been here already.

23:11.655 --> 23:15.857
Aziz?

23:15.859 --> 23:18.126
Sorry, Fermin.

23:18.128 --> 23:20.862
I sold him the laptop.

23:20.864 --> 23:22.697
I got him killed.

23:22.699 --> 23:26.251
- Is the laptop still here?
- I don't think so.

23:26.253 --> 23:28.036
He told me he found a buyer
this morning.

23:28.038 --> 23:29.087
He paid me my share.

23:29.089 --> 23:30.889
Mr. Mansoor sold the laptop

23:30.891 --> 23:33.341
before his demise
at the hands of the Estonians.

23:33.343 --> 23:36.544
They trashed this place looking for it.

23:36.546 --> 23:37.979
How'd they know to come here?

23:37.981 --> 23:39.714
Pushkov may have installed a beacon

23:39.716 --> 23:41.549
that turns on when you power it up.

23:41.551 --> 23:43.384
Anyone with an access code

23:43.386 --> 23:44.986
could follow it geographically.

23:44.988 --> 23:46.354
And they're willing to kill anyone

23:46.356 --> 23:47.889
who comes in contact with it.

23:47.891 --> 23:50.409
I've gotten into Aziz's email account.

23:50.411 --> 23:53.228
It appears that he sold the laptop

23:53.230 --> 23:55.330
to an online buyer
named "d3mn8."

23:55.332 --> 23:56.782
Any way we can track him?

23:56.784 --> 23:59.034
If d3mn8 discovers
what's on the laptop,

23:59.036 --> 24:00.535
he may try to flip it.

24:00.537 --> 24:02.671
In which case, he'd probably go
to the darknet,

24:02.673 --> 24:04.623
try to sell it on Silk Road

24:04.625 --> 24:06.341
or one of those black market forums.

24:06.343 --> 24:07.626
I'll try to track him down,

24:07.628 --> 24:09.577
see if I can negotiate a meeting.

24:09.579 --> 24:10.962
What about Aziz?

24:10.964 --> 24:13.381
The NYPD will be here shortly...

24:13.383 --> 24:14.966

Pushkov was killed by the Estonian mob.

They're chasing a laptop
he left in our driver's cab.

24:40.210 --> 24:41.230
Which explains

24:41.231 --> 24:42.711
the Secret Service swarming the body.

24:42.713 --> 24:44.496
Why do they want this laptop so bad?

24:44.498 --> 24:45.997
Don't know yet, but they're willing

24:45.999 --> 24:47.949
to kill anyone who comes
in contact with it.

24:47.951 --> 24:49.968
Keep an eye out for a blonde.

I'll pull our analytical brief
on the Estonians.

24:53.957 --> 24:56.725
Now, what's the bad news?

24:56.727 --> 24:58.393
They just dropped another body.

24:58.395 --> 25:00.178
I'll text you the address.

was a mistake!

No matter what I do,
nothing seems to turn out right.

25:06.312 --> 25:07.872
You mean, how you chose to get involved

25:07.873 --> 25:09.938
with a smuggler like Mendoza?

25:09.940 --> 25:12.908
Wh... Mendoza was our contact.

25:12.910 --> 25:14.359
When we defected,

25:14.361 --> 25:16.411
he arranged everything
for us ballplayers.

25:16.413 --> 25:17.946
He brought us all the way to New York.

25:17.948 --> 25:19.748
In exchange, he takes
a cut of your contract

25:19.749 --> 25:20.648
when you get paid?

25:20.650 --> 25:22.951
Mendoza said that's the way it worked.

25:22.953 --> 25:26.988
He promises the Moon.

25:26.990 --> 25:29.674
I thought baseball, this country,

25:29.676 --> 25:32.010
was gonna make me rich,

25:32.012 --> 25:34.262
but this game...

25:34.264 --> 25:36.515
you know, it lies to you.

25:36.517 --> 25:39.334
And once you got injured, it was over.

25:39.336 --> 25:42.971
You can't play, you can't make money.

25:42.973 --> 25:45.173
You become a nobody.

25:45.175 --> 25:47.392
So Mendoza figured
he'd find another way

25:47.394 --> 25:48.843
to get his money out of you.

25:48.845 --> 25:51.446
- Your family.

- Do you, Detective?
- Not yet.

that whatever it is,
it can embarrass the Government.

Look, I'm only trying to help.

Vadim Pushkov was a lone wolf
hacker extraordinaire.

27:01.385 --> 27:02.934
We first noticed him five years ago.

27:02.936 --> 27:06.054
He stole over 100,000
credit card numbers.

27:06.056 --> 27:07.472
The next time he turned up,

27:07.474 --> 27:10.576
he hacked into
a drone pilot station in Nevada

27:10.577 --> 27:12.777
and sold the flight control
encryption protocol online

27:12.779 --> 27:14.813
to a buyer in Pakistan.

27:14.815 --> 27:17.699
So, he showed up on your radar again,

27:54.237 --> 27:57.138
they found a $275 receipt on Pushkov

27:57.140 --> 27:59.607
for short-term parking at JFK.

27:59.609 --> 28:01.359
$275?

28:01.361 --> 28:03.144
Nothing short-term about that.

28:03.146 --> 28:04.996
No, and he wasn't flying anywhere.

So if Ordoz heard him say
"H-said,"

it's possible that he's speaking about

28:09.086 --> 28:12.837
the Homeland Security Automated
Identification Database.

28:12.839 --> 28:14.956
My best guess is he stole information

28:17.210 --> 28:20.378
Addresses, FBI clearances,
biometric data.

32:16.010 --> 32:18.061
This is the security camera footage

32:18.063 --> 32:20.012
we took from the computer store.

32:20.014 --> 32:24.684
We have Aziz Mansoor leaving
with the laptop.

32:24.686 --> 32:27.286
About 45 minutes later,
he returns without it.

32:27.288 --> 32:29.855
No laptop, hmm.
He must have sold it.

32:29.857 --> 32:31.824
But look at this.

32:31.826 --> 32:35.828
- 20 minutes later...
- She's in the file.

32:35.830 --> 32:39.298
Estonian operator named Irina Kapp.

Interpol issued a red notice
on her six months ago.

I brought the money.

But you're not him.

33:18.039 --> 33:20.173
- You're not d3mn8.
- What do you know?

33:20.175 --> 33:23.242
I know that he's sitting
right over there.

33:23.244 --> 33:25.364
And if he's gonna remotely
monitor a wireless camera

33:25.365 --> 33:26.212
with his phone,

33:26.214 --> 33:28.131
[Raises voice]
He should take better care

33:28.133 --> 33:29.766
to encrypt its IP address.

33:29.768 --> 33:33.019
Whoa.
[Bear barks]

You don't want to do that.

to see the laptop first.

33:58.712 --> 34:00.663
You're not with the Estonians.

34:00.665 --> 34:02.365
No, I'm not.

34:02.367 --> 34:04.000
You tried to buy the laptop earlier.

34:04.002 --> 34:05.882
But I didn't like
the way your partner looked.

34:05.883 --> 34:07.970
So you arranged to make
a deal with the Estonians,

34:07.972 --> 34:09.455
thinking they would pay more.

34:09.456 --> 34:10.973
You'd be wrong.

34:17.264 --> 34:18.797
What's the catch?

34:18.800 --> 34:21.266
The catch...
Albert,

34:21.268 --> 34:23.152
is that you leave this very second,

34:23.154 --> 34:26.022
disappear, and don't show
your face for at least a year.

34:26.024 --> 34:28.440
Especially not
at your mom's house in Queens,

34:28.443 --> 34:29.942
where you presently reside.

34:29.944 --> 34:32.178
Take your money and go far, far away.

34:32.179 --> 34:34.864
Some very bad people want that laptop.

34:34.866 --> 34:36.346
And if they know you've even seen it,

34:36.347 --> 34:39.318
they will kill you.

34:39.320 --> 34:43.505
So that's the catch, Albert.

34:43.507 --> 34:45.491
Then why would you want it?

34:45.493 --> 34:46.876
Let me worry about that.

34:46.878 --> 34:48.561
Take your money.

34:48.563 --> 34:53.181
Go. Now.

Got distracted.

Did you get the laptop?

35:06.815 --> 35:07.947
Yes, I'm here,

35:07.949 --> 35:10.533
and I have the laptop,
Mr. Reese.

35:10.535 --> 35:14.153
But I'm afraid you'd better come
rather quickly.

35:14.155 --> 35:17.189
I think you have something
that belongs to me.

35:27.744 --> 35:29.277

I don't have to.
I know what's on it.
