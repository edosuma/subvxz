WEBVTT

00:03.133 --> 00:03.433
Tonight on part two

00:05.166 --> 00:06.300
of the "Vanderpump Rules"
reunion...

00:06.300 --> 00:08.033
- It's not the right time
for that.

00:08.033 --> 00:09.233
- Is there a right time
to stick your d---

00:09.233 --> 00:11.233
in someone who's not
your girlfriend?

00:12.233 --> 00:13.700
- Katie was--for a long time,

00:13.700 --> 00:15.100
she was a nightmare
of a human being.

00:16.433 --> 00:18.700
- Why did you think
Stassi was ignorant?

00:18.700 --> 00:21.300
You said someone should school
her white, privileged ass.

00:21.300 --> 00:22.700
- Yeah.

00:22.700 --> 00:25.133
- It was quite a moment
when you asked Kelsey

00:25.133 --> 00:26.533
to call you
by your real name, Jason.

00:26.533 --> 00:28.166
- It was just like, "Oh!"

00:28.166 --> 00:30.233
Like, I turned into
heart eyes.

00:30.233 --> 00:32.000
- Billie Lee.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.433
- Actually, I looked at porn
so I could say

00:33.433 --> 00:35.166
what vagina looks really nice.

00:35.166 --> 00:37.033
- Well, those vaginas
are edited.

00:37.033 --> 00:39.734
- Well, I wanted
an edited, pretty vagina.

00:39.734 --> 00:42.433
- What does your boyfriend
make of James,

00:42.433 --> 00:45.033
who's called him
a "fat old man"?

00:45.033 --> 00:47.066
- I've apologized for what
I've said about Randall.

00:47.066 --> 00:48.200
- But then you do it again.

00:48.200 --> 00:50.066
- Oh, right,
but then I do it again,

00:50.066 --> 00:51.333
so where the
do you want me to go from here?

00:51.333 --> 00:53.433
- You're dismissed.

00:53.433 --> 00:56.066
- Part two of the "Vanderpump
Rules" reunion starts now.

00:56.066 --> 01:00.033
- ♪ Just raise
your glasses high ♪

01:00.033 --> 01:02.467
♪ This one's for you tonight ♪

01:02.467 --> 01:04.333
- You didn't even call me
when my father died.

01:06.166 --> 01:08.133
Check your ----ing
text messages.

01:08.133 --> 01:10.066
you for saying that.
- She did text you.

01:10.066 --> 01:11.333
- Can I just have
one minute, please?

01:11.333 --> 01:13.266
I just--I need a minute.
I'm sorry.

01:13.266 --> 01:14.700
I've never done this,
but I need a minute.

01:14.700 --> 01:16.033
- She did text you
about your dad.

01:16.033 --> 01:17.333
- A text.

01:17.333 --> 01:19.333
I had two ex-girlfriends
and a girl who hated me

01:19.333 --> 01:21.300
show up in Michigan
without even asking.

01:22.500 --> 01:23.767
- James even reached out
to me, man.

01:23.767 --> 01:25.367
He was even saying, like,

01:25.367 --> 01:26.567
"Man, I wanted to let
the things calm down."

01:26.567 --> 01:27.767
Out of all people.

01:27.767 --> 01:29.333
- He's upset about his dad.

01:29.333 --> 01:30.600
He's projecting it onto you.
- I know.

01:30.600 --> 01:32.033
- My father died!
- I know, Jax.

01:32.033 --> 01:33.233
- I needed my friends,

01:33.233 --> 01:34.333
because I didn't have
anybody else.

01:34.333 --> 01:35.367
- Jax, she texted you!

01:35.367 --> 01:36.734
Oh, a text? Ooh!

01:36.734 --> 01:38.367
You're supposed to be
my friend over years.

01:38.367 --> 01:40.233
I'm just looking for some love
there for a second.

01:40.233 --> 01:41.600
- She did!

01:41.600 --> 01:44.033
- She's coming back.
She's just crying.

01:44.033 --> 01:45.333
And her lashes came off.

01:45.333 --> 01:47.433
- Oh, her makeup.
you.

01:47.433 --> 01:49.066
You can't even keep
a boyfriend!

01:49.066 --> 01:50.500
All right, all right,
I'll drop it,

01:50.500 --> 01:52.100
'cause I'm wrong,
and I'm not gonna win here--

01:52.100 --> 01:53.567
- I'm not saying
you're wrong, Jax.

01:53.567 --> 01:55.233
You're just not listening.
- No one is saying that.

01:55.233 --> 01:57.100
- She did reach out--
- I'm 100% right.

01:57.100 --> 01:59.433
- But, Jax, to clarify,
she did text you.

01:59.433 --> 02:01.266
- We're talking about
the reaching out.

02:01.266 --> 02:03.400
- And she texted Brittany
every day after,

02:03.400 --> 02:05.100
checking on you, so...

02:05.100 --> 02:06.233
- She was doing that,
and I will--

02:06.233 --> 02:08.133
like, she was texting me.

02:09.533 --> 02:12.467
- Um, no,
but I'm a professional.

02:12.467 --> 02:15.000
- Okay.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.400
I want to talk
about your man, Lala.

02:17.400 --> 02:19.266
You're still together.
- Yes.

02:19.266 --> 02:23.066
- He is a successful producer,
and let me ask you this,

02:23.066 --> 02:25.600
because now you've been
together for a while.

02:25.600 --> 02:28.266
- Two years, yeah.
- You're clearly very happy.

02:28.266 --> 02:31.633
You denied, over the years,
all of the allegations

02:31.633 --> 02:33.266
that your boyfriend
was married.

02:33.266 --> 02:35.000
- Correct.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.233
- It seems that maybe
he was married

02:37.233 --> 02:39.500
when you starting dating,
correct?

02:39.500 --> 02:44.266
- Well, when I met Rand,
he had a legal separation,

02:44.266 --> 02:47.300
so I don't see how I did
anything wrong.

02:47.300 --> 02:48.667
- Show of hands.

02:48.667 --> 02:51.166
How many people here
have met Lala's man?

02:51.166 --> 02:52.667
- I love him.
- Many times.

02:52.667 --> 02:54.567
- Wow, everybody.
- He's super charming.

02:54.567 --> 02:56.166
- Tom and Tom play poker
with him.

02:56.166 --> 02:57.433
- Yeah.
- Wow.

02:57.433 --> 02:59.300
- What does he think
of the show?

02:59.300 --> 03:01.567
- He definitely watches.
Let's put it that way.

03:01.567 --> 03:03.433
- He loves it.

03:03.433 --> 03:07.266
- Tell the story about
who else watches the show.

03:07.266 --> 03:09.567
- Martin Scorsese
loves the show.

03:11.166 --> 03:13.166
- We inspire his works.
- Yeah.

03:14.300 --> 03:15.667
- Yeah, he watches the show,

03:15.667 --> 03:18.400
and I feel like he, like,
likes to sit there

03:18.400 --> 03:20.533
and, like,
be the little gossip king.

03:20.533 --> 03:23.667
- Who, Scorsese or--
- No, my boyfriend, Rand.

03:23.667 --> 03:27.033
- Okay, so you've said
that your man, Randall,

03:27.033 --> 03:28.333
loves to give you gifts.

03:28.333 --> 03:31.433
What kind of gifts
does he give you?

03:31.433 --> 03:33.567
- Shoes, purses, cars.

03:33.567 --> 03:35.600
- Materialistic things.

03:35.600 --> 03:37.300
- Everyone can sit there
and be like,

03:37.300 --> 03:38.467
"Her man does this.
Her man does that."

03:38.467 --> 03:40.200
It's like, "Okay,
you're just mad

03:40.200 --> 03:41.600
'cause your man
doesn't do that," so...

03:41.600 --> 03:44.066
Whenever I make music,
it comes out of my pocket.

03:44.066 --> 03:46.333
My rent, my man gave me a cap,

03:46.333 --> 03:48.533
which we are well above
the cap,

03:48.533 --> 03:51.266
so Mama paying a lot for rent.

03:51.266 --> 03:55.066
As far as my cars go,
it's like, "Here's the lease,

03:55.066 --> 03:57.200
but you best be
paying insurance."

03:57.200 --> 03:59.400
- I'm in an i8 today.

04:00.667 --> 04:01.667
- I don't even know
what that is.

04:04.667 --> 04:07.333
♪ ♪

04:07.333 --> 04:09.367
- That's not yours.
- Yeah.

04:09.367 --> 04:11.367
That's my whip
that I'm driving around for--

04:12.633 --> 04:14.367
- Well, like Lisa,
I have it for a few months

04:14.367 --> 04:15.633
just to, like, dink around.

04:15.633 --> 04:18.233
- Not like Lisa;
Lisa works for it

04:18.233 --> 04:21.233
and doesn't have somebody
to buy it for her.

04:21.233 --> 04:23.100
- That's true.

04:23.100 --> 04:26.100
- Okay, why is that I have
a "sugar daddy"

04:26.100 --> 04:29.233
but James is, like,
living on some guy's floor

04:29.233 --> 04:31.500
and his rent's being paid
and no one's--

04:31.500 --> 04:33.433
- I pay rent.
You know I pay rent.

04:35.200 --> 04:37.100
- I don't have a sugar daddy,
thank you very much.

04:37.100 --> 04:38.567
- You're the one
that sits there and says

04:38.567 --> 04:40.633
that I'm sleeping with people
to pay my rent.

04:40.633 --> 04:42.567
- Everyone has said that
before.

04:42.567 --> 04:44.233
- What is your
living situation?

04:44.233 --> 04:45.500
Does someone pay your rent?

04:45.500 --> 04:46.467
- No, no, no.

04:46.467 --> 04:49.633
Basically, the guy has
his own bedroom,

04:49.633 --> 04:51.266
and then I'm
in the living room, right?

04:51.266 --> 04:54.367
And then he moves on and off
from San Francisco.

04:54.367 --> 04:55.533
- Hey, James.
- Yo.

04:56.734 --> 04:58.266
What's good?

04:58.266 --> 05:00.367
Bosco!

05:00.367 --> 05:02.400
- Making some new music, yeah.

05:02.400 --> 05:03.533
What's your plan?
What you doing?

05:03.533 --> 05:05.266
- Ah, probably go
to dinner.

05:05.266 --> 05:07.133
I was gonna see
if you'd come with me.

05:07.133 --> 05:08.367
I probably owe you a dinner.

05:08.367 --> 05:09.400
- Not tonight, not tonight.

05:09.400 --> 05:11.500
Um, but yeah.

05:11.500 --> 05:13.633
- Is it hypocritical
on your part

05:13.633 --> 05:15.400
to be mouthing off

05:15.400 --> 05:16.667
when you're living with a guy
who may be--

05:18.400 --> 05:20.533
I didn't know that Lala
actually paid her own rent,

05:20.533 --> 05:22.400
so yeah, maybe it was
a little bit hypocritical.

05:22.400 --> 05:24.467
- Doesn't matter if I wasn't
paying my own rent.

05:24.467 --> 05:26.200
It's rude.
You were my friend.

05:26.200 --> 05:27.533
- Fine, I apologize
for saying that.

05:27.533 --> 05:31.367
- Lala, what does your
boyfriend make of James,

05:31.367 --> 05:32.567
who's called him
a "fat old man"?

05:32.567 --> 05:34.233
- How would you feel

05:34.233 --> 05:36.433
if someone called you
a fat old man?

05:36.433 --> 05:38.300
- I wouldn't love it.

05:38.300 --> 05:40.567
- You ----ed the fat man
'cause he pays for your rent.

05:40.567 --> 05:42.166
- Stop, stop, stop, stop.

05:43.567 --> 05:45.300
You can't say
whatever the  you want,

05:45.300 --> 05:46.433
so know how the
to talk to somebody

05:46.433 --> 05:48.567
when they're your friend.
I'm out.

05:48.567 --> 05:50.700
- Look, I've apologized for
what I've said about Randall--

05:50.700 --> 05:52.533
- But then you do it again.

05:52.533 --> 05:54.433
But then you do it again,
and I want you to stop.

05:54.433 --> 05:55.533
- I'm sorry again.

05:55.533 --> 05:57.300
- It's not about being--

05:57.300 --> 05:58.700
- Oh, right,
but then I do it again,

05:58.700 --> 06:00.367
so where the  do you
want me to go from here?

06:00.367 --> 06:01.700
- Stop doing it!
- There's nowhere to go.

06:01.700 --> 06:03.500
- It's really simple.
- I've said I will.

06:03.500 --> 06:05.433
I said I will.
- I would never do that to you.

06:06.500 --> 06:07.700
I'll try not to, at least.

06:07.700 --> 06:10.000
- Whatever.
You're dismissed.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.667
- Stassi, you threw
a " Jax" party

06:12.667 --> 06:14.734
for Brittany,
and you invited everybody.

06:14.734 --> 06:17.667
- We're gonna beat the sh--
out of that piñata.

06:17.667 --> 06:20.333
- Oh, yes, we are.
- Oh, my God.

06:20.333 --> 06:22.467
- Was the purpose of the party
to cheer up Brittany

06:22.467 --> 06:25.000
or to dump on Jax?

06:25.000 --> 06:26.734
- We had been hearing

06:26.734 --> 06:28.467
that she was thinking
about moving to Kentucky,

06:28.467 --> 06:31.333
and we all were on
the same page to show her

06:31.333 --> 06:33.567
that he's not the link
between us and Brittany.

06:33.567 --> 06:36.333
Brittany's already our friend.

06:36.333 --> 06:39.200
- And I--like, I've said it
a million times

06:39.200 --> 06:40.467
with all these girls up here.

06:40.467 --> 06:42.200
I probably either
would have went home

06:42.200 --> 06:44.600
or would have been way worse
than I was this summer.

06:44.600 --> 06:47.467
Like, I just can't
thank you guys enough,

06:47.467 --> 06:49.033
because that means everything.

06:49.033 --> 06:50.734
- Thank you guys
for being there for her too.

06:50.734 --> 06:52.467
- We love you, Britt.
- 'Cause she wouldn't be here.

06:52.467 --> 06:54.300
And we wouldn't be sitting
next to each other.

06:54.300 --> 06:55.700
So as much as you guys
hated me...

06:55.700 --> 06:57.500
- And I know you guys
didn't really want me

06:57.500 --> 06:59.367
to get back with him,
but still you have had my back.

06:59.367 --> 07:01.433
You know, no matter what,
you had my back,

07:01.433 --> 07:04.300
and that's, like--that's what
I will always remember.

07:04.300 --> 07:06.500
- Kristen, what did you think
of Jax's argument

07:06.500 --> 07:08.367
that it's his relationship

07:08.367 --> 07:10.767
and nobody else should
meddle in it?

07:10.767 --> 07:13.600
- I think that's just
a bullsh-- excuse

07:13.600 --> 07:17.333
that Jax uses
to shut everyone off

07:17.333 --> 07:19.500
because he doesn't want to hear
what we have to say.

07:19.500 --> 07:21.734
Do I know what it's like
behind closed doors?

07:21.734 --> 07:23.600
No, but Brittany's
my best friend,

07:23.600 --> 07:26.066
so it is our business,
because we care.

07:26.066 --> 07:29.633
- Ariana, you said
that you were 100% sure

07:29.633 --> 07:33.233
that Jax had slept with Faith
multiple times.

07:33.233 --> 07:34.500
- Mm-hmm.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.400
- Faith.
- Faith.

07:37.400 --> 07:39.667
- Faith telling James
and multiple people.

07:41.400 --> 07:43.266
- No, and I swear
on my father--

07:43.266 --> 07:45.633
on my father--
it happened one time.

07:45.633 --> 07:47.500
- She was chasing him, clearly.

07:47.500 --> 07:48.667
- That's not--
no, no, no.

07:48.667 --> 07:50.400
It's my--
no, no, no, no.

07:50.400 --> 07:52.667
- No, I'm not excusing
your behavior or your actions.

07:52.667 --> 07:54.400
But I'm saying,
as much as she wanted

07:54.400 --> 07:56.066
your gorgeous body, I'm sure,

07:56.066 --> 07:58.667
she also wanted to be part
of this whole situation.

07:58.667 --> 08:00.734
She did.
That's why she taped him.

08:00.734 --> 08:02.500
It was a premeditated move.

08:02.500 --> 08:03.500
- So let me ask this.

08:03.500 --> 08:05.000
She makes this recording.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.367
James, you decide to--

08:08.367 --> 08:10.533
- I sent it to my phone.

08:10.533 --> 08:12.400
- You sent it to your phone.
Why?

08:12.400 --> 08:14.066
- You know, I figured,
like, "Why not?"

08:14.066 --> 08:16.533
You know, it's just like,
I had it on my thing.

08:16.533 --> 08:18.300
- You wanted it
in your back pocket.

08:18.300 --> 08:20.100
- Yeah, I had it
in my ----ing back pocket.

08:20.100 --> 08:21.767
- Do what I would do.

08:21.767 --> 08:23.433
You want it in your back pocket
in case you needed it.

08:23.433 --> 08:24.700
That's what I would have done.

08:24.700 --> 08:26.300
- I didn't even believe Faith
at the time,

08:26.300 --> 08:27.700
because I didn't hear it
until I took it.

08:27.700 --> 08:29.500
So I went into the bathroom
at Sur, sent it to mine,

08:29.500 --> 08:31.033
and I ----ing listened
to the whole thing,

08:31.033 --> 08:32.700
and then I believed it finally.

08:32.700 --> 08:34.700
- Lala, do you regret
playing the tape for Brittany?

08:34.700 --> 08:37.433
- Absolutely not,
because I asked Brittany,

08:37.433 --> 08:39.033
"Do you want to hear this?"

08:39.033 --> 08:41.100
- Lala, if you are sh--faced,
utterly sh--faced,

08:41.100 --> 08:43.700
and I tell you, "I have
a recording of your boyfriend

08:43.700 --> 08:44.767
with some other dude"--

08:44.767 --> 08:46.433
- Yeah, sober--

08:46.433 --> 08:48.000
- Maybe don't be
with another woman!

08:48.000 --> 08:49.300
- No, I know, but, like--

08:49.300 --> 08:51.567
Then there's no recording ever!

08:51.567 --> 08:53.500
- At that point in time,
at a housewarming party,

08:53.500 --> 08:55.667
it's not the right time
for that; let's be real.

08:55.667 --> 08:57.433
- Maybe it wasn't
the right time, but--

08:59.033 --> 09:00.333
- Is there a right time
to stick your d---

09:00.333 --> 09:02.500
in someone who's not
your girlfriend?

09:03.667 --> 09:05.200
- Lala.

09:08.734 --> 09:11.066
- Kristen and Katie
did not run after Stassi

09:11.066 --> 09:12.600
like in the past.

09:12.600 --> 09:15.533
- I miss the days when people
used to run after me.

09:15.533 --> 09:16.600
- She acted like an asshole,

09:16.600 --> 09:17.767
so I treated her
like an asshole.

09:28.200 --> 09:28.567
- Welcome back to the

09:28.567 --> 09:29.166
- Welcome back to the
"Vanderpump Rules" reunion.

09:30.467 --> 09:32.533
I'm Andy Cohen.

09:32.533 --> 09:34.433
Katie, you said if you were
to go on a private jet,

09:34.433 --> 09:36.166
it would be because
you chartered it

09:36.166 --> 09:38.066
and not because of someone's

09:38.066 --> 09:40.500
sugar daddy married boyfriend.

09:40.500 --> 09:43.567
But then I saw you posting
on the private jet.

09:43.567 --> 09:44.767
- I know.

09:44.767 --> 09:46.367
- What made you change
your mind?

09:46.367 --> 09:47.367
- An invitation.

09:47.367 --> 09:49.567
- I said a lot of things

09:49.567 --> 09:51.633
just because I was
a hateful person

09:51.633 --> 09:55.100
and I wanted just to sh--
on her parade.

09:55.100 --> 09:57.200
- Do you regret
being so hard on her?

09:57.200 --> 10:01.100
- I do regret being hateful.

10:01.100 --> 10:03.500
- Lala, Scheana did not
seem happy to hear

10:03.500 --> 10:05.500
that you made up with Katie.

10:05.500 --> 10:09.100
Why do you think she was so
against you patching things up?

10:09.100 --> 10:11.467
- I would--correct me
if I'm wrong.

10:11.467 --> 10:13.200
I feel like
when someone attacks you,

10:13.200 --> 10:14.700
you can forgive it
very easily,

10:14.700 --> 10:16.734
but when someone attacks
someone that you care for,

10:16.734 --> 10:19.633
it's a little bit harder
to forgive.

10:19.633 --> 10:21.367
So I don't know.

10:21.367 --> 10:23.000
I feel like
she and I were friends--

10:23.000 --> 10:24.400
- I just felt like
it wasn't genuine.

10:24.400 --> 10:26.100
I felt Katie was
coming off a season

10:26.100 --> 10:28.667
where she was very negative
towards Lala,

10:28.667 --> 10:30.000
got a lot of sh--
on social media,

10:30.000 --> 10:31.400
was trying to save face

10:31.400 --> 10:32.734
and come back, like,
as this new woman

10:32.734 --> 10:34.467
who's all about peace
and getting along.

10:34.467 --> 10:35.734
- That's a really cynical way
to look at it.

10:35.734 --> 10:36.734
- It felt fake to me
at the time.

10:36.734 --> 10:38.400
- That's what you would do.

10:38.400 --> 10:40.000
- Okay, I'm saying
that's how I felt.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.600
- After Katie remarked about

10:41.600 --> 10:43.767
not wanting to fly
with Lala's married boyfriend,

10:43.767 --> 10:45.667
you went straight to Lala.

10:45.667 --> 10:48.367
Why did you feel the need
to call out Katie?

10:48.367 --> 10:50.100
- Because she was
one of my closest friends,

10:50.100 --> 10:51.533
and if someone's
saying something

10:51.533 --> 10:52.633
about one of
my closest friends,

10:52.633 --> 10:53.767
I'm going to tell them,

10:53.767 --> 10:55.533
as I hope
they would do with me.

10:55.533 --> 10:57.066
- You know
what you were doing.

10:57.066 --> 10:58.400
- Yes, I was repeating
something you said.

10:58.400 --> 11:00.633
- You knew about
the Tom-and-her-friend

11:00.633 --> 11:02.066
whole situation,
and you knew

11:02.066 --> 11:03.533
if she could be mad at me--

11:03.533 --> 11:05.000
- Then maybe
you shouldn't have said it.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.433
- I'm not denying what I said.

11:06.433 --> 11:07.567
I'm denying
what your intentions were

11:07.567 --> 11:09.166
by going to her
and saying that.

11:09.166 --> 11:10.233
- Because you are
in my brain and body,

11:10.233 --> 11:11.433
and you know my intentions.

11:11.433 --> 11:12.700
I'm sorry; I forgot that.

11:12.700 --> 11:13.767
- You seem to know mine
and hers and hers

11:13.767 --> 11:15.000
and everyone else's.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.567
- And now it's better.

11:16.567 --> 11:18.166
You guys are best friends,
so you're welcome.

11:18.166 --> 11:20.166
- Stop throwing
"best friends" around.

11:20.166 --> 11:21.567
I am not in kindergarten.

11:21.567 --> 11:23.100
Are you in junior high?

11:23.100 --> 11:25.133
"You're all best friends,
and now I'm out again."

11:25.133 --> 11:27.000
- Too many people talking
at once.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.700
- So what we're talking
about is,

11:28.700 --> 11:31.633
Lala, you hit back at Katie
with a rumor

11:31.633 --> 11:34.567
that Schwartz,
Katie's husband,

11:34.567 --> 11:36.567
kissed another girl.

11:36.567 --> 11:37.633
- I went to high school
with her.

11:37.633 --> 11:38.767
She knows
exactly who I am.

11:38.767 --> 11:40.166
I'm friends with her
on Facebook.

11:40.166 --> 11:41.567
She knows
I'm married to him.

11:41.567 --> 11:43.033
She came up to him and said,
"Hi, I know you,

11:43.033 --> 11:44.567
and I'm friends with Lala."

11:44.567 --> 11:46.600
- I understand,
but at the end of the day,

11:46.600 --> 11:49.033
she's not married to you,
so let's remember, Schwartzy--

11:49.033 --> 11:50.467
- Whoa.
I didn't say anything.

11:50.467 --> 11:52.033
I'm not putting the blame
on her.

11:52.033 --> 11:53.133
I accept responsibility.

11:53.133 --> 11:54.734
And, by the way, to this day,

11:54.734 --> 11:57.200
I promise you guys
I do not remember that.

11:57.200 --> 11:59.066
- Katie, do you believe

11:59.066 --> 12:00.533
that he doesn't remember it?

12:02.467 --> 12:04.066
- Yeah.

12:04.066 --> 12:05.600
- Yeah.
- I was utterly hammered.

12:05.600 --> 12:07.734
And listen, in the past,
like, I said,

12:07.734 --> 12:09.734
I mean, we had a lot
relationship issues.

12:09.734 --> 12:11.200
And, unfortunately, in, like,

12:11.200 --> 12:12.734
the most cowardly way,
I was trying

12:12.734 --> 12:14.200
to sabotage my relationship.

12:14.200 --> 12:15.734
is wrong with you?

12:15.734 --> 12:17.066
- I love doing that.
- Oh, Jax.

12:17.066 --> 12:19.567
- Jax, were you secretly happy

12:19.567 --> 12:21.266
that you were out
of the hot seat?

12:21.266 --> 12:22.734
- Yes, of course.

12:24.467 --> 12:26.066
But I wish it could have been
something else.

12:26.066 --> 12:27.467
Obviously, there was
a lot of heat going on

12:27.467 --> 12:29.100
with Brittany and I,

12:29.100 --> 12:30.567
and I was just looking for
anything at that moment,

12:30.567 --> 12:32.033
but of course, no,
I didn't want that.

12:32.033 --> 12:33.633
I mean, it could have
been anything.

12:33.633 --> 12:35.767
- Katie, you got over it
pretty quickly.

12:35.767 --> 12:37.500
How did this happen?

12:37.500 --> 12:40.600
- I try to see bigger picture

12:40.600 --> 12:42.767
and just say, "How important
is this in my life?

12:42.767 --> 12:44.567
"How much am I going
to subscribe to this?

12:44.567 --> 12:45.767
How much am I going
to put myself into this?"

12:45.767 --> 12:47.066
- Wow.

12:47.066 --> 12:48.233
- I think we spend
too much time

12:48.233 --> 12:50.066
worrying about sh--
that doesn't matter,

12:50.066 --> 12:51.300
because life is very short,

12:51.300 --> 12:54.100
and tomorrow's
not promised, so...

12:54.100 --> 12:55.567
- If you can move on
from it,

12:55.567 --> 12:57.600
then do your best
to move on from it.

12:57.600 --> 13:00.100
- James, did Schwartz get
off the hook too easily?

13:00.100 --> 13:02.633
- Look...
- You can say it.

13:02.633 --> 13:04.500
- All right, I just think,
you know,

13:04.500 --> 13:06.066
you're the only one
that's married, bro,

13:06.066 --> 13:07.767
so it's just like
another level.

13:07.767 --> 13:09.633
And I know you blacked you
and you don't remember,

13:09.633 --> 13:12.100
and I know she seduced you,
but the answer's yes.

13:12.100 --> 13:15.133
That's what I think.
A little too easy, but hey.

13:15.133 --> 13:18.133
- So and then to have
the conversation at Sur

13:18.133 --> 13:19.333
in front of everyone--

13:19.333 --> 13:21.133
- I was trying
to make it, like,

13:21.133 --> 13:24.000
as private and discreet
and respectful as possible

13:24.000 --> 13:25.367
by being like,
"I found out about this.

13:25.367 --> 13:27.066
Please bring this up
to Katie in private."

13:27.066 --> 13:29.667
- I wanted to just click
my heels and disappear.

13:29.667 --> 13:31.367
Just to see her hurt
after how much

13:31.367 --> 13:33.266
we've been through
and worked through,

13:33.266 --> 13:34.633
I felt like a possum's prick.

13:34.633 --> 13:36.266
I felt this big.

13:36.266 --> 13:39.333
- A possum's prick.

13:39.333 --> 13:41.266
- A possum's prick.

13:41.266 --> 13:44.200
- I was watching "Smokey and
the Bandit" the other night.

13:44.200 --> 13:48.000
But anyways, I've always loved
falling apart in moderation.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.033
I think it's good
for the mind, body, soul.

13:50.033 --> 13:51.567
- I--

13:51.567 --> 13:52.700
- Do you ever consider
cutting back on drinking?

13:52.700 --> 13:54.633
- Of course.

13:54.633 --> 13:56.233
It's not like I'm
getting hammered every day.

13:56.233 --> 13:57.567
I'm not hitting the bot--

13:57.567 --> 13:59.266
When I do drink,
I drink hard, but--

13:59.266 --> 14:02.166
- There's no excuse
for drinking that much.

14:02.166 --> 14:04.367
Did you see him in Mexico?
Blackout drunk.

14:04.367 --> 14:07.166
- Last night is, like--
it's a blur.

14:07.166 --> 14:09.033
I remember bits and pieces,

14:09.033 --> 14:11.133
like I remember, you know,
tequila shots,

14:11.133 --> 14:13.166
lots of tequila shots.

14:13.166 --> 14:16.033
I remember James shirtless.

14:16.033 --> 14:18.367
I remember, like, penis flutes.

14:21.100 --> 14:23.700
I remember dancing...

14:23.700 --> 14:25.233
and kissing.

14:28.700 --> 14:31.000
Um, and then--yeah.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.734
From there, it just sort of--

14:32.734 --> 14:34.333
I don't know what happened
after that.

14:34.333 --> 14:36.333
- That's the blacking out
that scares me,

14:36.333 --> 14:39.266
because there's so many things
that could've happened to you.

14:39.266 --> 14:40.333
You're in a foreign country.

14:40.333 --> 14:42.166
People get kidnapped, killed.

14:42.166 --> 14:44.333
You could have gone
into the ocean and drowned.

14:44.333 --> 14:46.333
- So, Katie,
how have things been

14:46.333 --> 14:47.734
with you and Schwartz

14:47.734 --> 14:49.266
relating to the drinking?

14:49.266 --> 14:51.266
- Um, it's been good.

14:51.266 --> 14:55.734
Like he's been handling himself
pretty well, not doing shots.

14:55.734 --> 14:57.700
- People just come up,
and they buy us shots,

14:57.700 --> 14:58.734
and Schwartz has
a really hard time

14:58.734 --> 15:00.333
telling people no.

15:00.333 --> 15:02.066
- If they're saying
you have a hard time

15:02.066 --> 15:03.734
turning down shots,
we're gonna role-play.

15:03.734 --> 15:05.333
I'm a patron.

15:05.333 --> 15:07.066
I'm at Tom Tom.

15:07.066 --> 15:08.333
- I just bought two shots.
- Yeah.

15:08.333 --> 15:10.166
Oh, my God, Tom, I love you.

15:10.166 --> 15:12.033
I love Tom Tom.
I love the show.

15:12.033 --> 15:13.333
Here, I bought you a shot.

15:13.333 --> 15:14.633
- All right, I'll do one.

15:14.633 --> 15:16.467
- Okay.

15:16.467 --> 15:18.433
- Dude.
- Tom, I'm telling you.

15:18.433 --> 15:20.233
I would sever a relationship

15:20.233 --> 15:23.166
if I had a partner
that gets so drunk,

15:23.166 --> 15:25.633
he's blacked out on the floor,
making out with somebody.

15:25.633 --> 15:28.633
It's not gonna happen
in our new restaurant.

15:28.633 --> 15:31.233
It's not going to happen.
I'm telling you that now.

15:31.233 --> 15:34.100
- Okay, it's time to talk about

15:34.100 --> 15:36.700
one of everybody's favorite
national holidays,

15:36.700 --> 15:39.767
one which Ariana is blessed
to share.

15:39.767 --> 15:42.100
That's Stassi's birthday.
- Oh, please!

15:42.100 --> 15:44.233
It was--wait, if I say
it was mine first,

15:44.233 --> 15:45.600
that means
I'm just telling everybody

15:45.600 --> 15:46.767
I'm older than you.

15:48.300 --> 15:50.467
- You went to
a Hollywood prop house.

15:50.467 --> 15:53.300
You went all out
for your murder party.

15:53.300 --> 15:56.200
And your boyfriend
doesn't bother to dress up.

15:57.367 --> 15:59.133
- Oh, my gosh!

15:59.133 --> 16:01.333
Honestly, I feel
like I'm in "Saw."

16:03.467 --> 16:05.133
That is where
it crosses the line.

16:05.133 --> 16:07.000
- Of all the things.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.667
Of all the horrible things
he said the entire season--

16:09.667 --> 16:11.233
- That's worse!

16:11.233 --> 16:12.400
- Not even bothering
to dress up for your party

16:12.400 --> 16:14.133
is kind of, like, number one.

16:14.133 --> 16:16.266
- It was so sh---y.
It made me really sad.

16:16.266 --> 16:18.367
- Katie offered you
an ass shot.

16:18.367 --> 16:23.333
You turned into a nun
and refused it.

16:23.333 --> 16:27.200
Did Patrick's presence
play into your mind that much?

16:27.200 --> 16:31.266
- I was so worked up
during my birthday party,

16:31.266 --> 16:33.133
just trying to...
- The answer is yes.

16:33.133 --> 16:35.500
- Make everyone happy,
knowing that Patrick was there,

16:35.500 --> 16:37.433
wanting him to be happy.

16:37.433 --> 16:40.233
And then I hadn't been able
to talk to him the whole night,

16:40.233 --> 16:41.767
and then I finally sit down
with him,

16:41.767 --> 16:44.500
and I'm wasted,
dressed as a dead person,

16:44.500 --> 16:47.400
and Katie comes out
and just says,

16:47.400 --> 16:48.500
"Do you want to do this?"

16:48.500 --> 16:50.700
And I just lost it.

16:52.433 --> 16:54.166
- I don't know.

16:54.166 --> 16:56.700
You know when you're so
intoxicated and on edge.

16:56.700 --> 16:58.300
- But the interesting thing is,

16:58.300 --> 17:01.166
Kristen and Katie
did not run after Stassi,

17:01.166 --> 17:02.166
like in the past.

17:02.166 --> 17:04.033
That was a powerful moment.

17:04.033 --> 17:05.266
- I miss the days

17:05.266 --> 17:07.100
when people used to
run after me.

17:07.100 --> 17:09.166
- That was our old friendship.

17:09.166 --> 17:11.300
We all had our time apart

17:11.300 --> 17:13.033
and a break from each other,

17:13.033 --> 17:14.433
and when we came back
to our friendship,

17:14.433 --> 17:15.533
we're like,
"We're not gonna have

17:15.533 --> 17:16.700
"the same friendship anymore.

17:16.700 --> 17:18.166
It's gonna be different."

17:18.166 --> 17:20.166
And that does not include
chasing after her

17:20.166 --> 17:22.266
and coddling her
when she needs to be,

17:22.266 --> 17:24.333
you know, talked down
from a tantrum she's having.

17:24.333 --> 17:26.333
- Wow, it's a new strategy.

17:26.333 --> 17:27.467
- She acted like an asshole,

17:27.467 --> 17:29.000
so I treated her
like an asshole.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.467
- Yeah.

17:32.066 --> 17:33.433
- I think Adam's cute,
of course.

17:33.433 --> 17:35.066
I mean, I think
he's very handsome.

17:35.066 --> 17:37.200

- It looks great.

17:58.467 --> 18:00.133

18:00.133 --> 18:01.467
- You just have one

18:01.467 --> 18:03.333

18:03.333 --> 18:05.300
No.

18:05.300 --> 18:07.100

18:07.100 --> 18:08.367

18:08.367 --> 18:10.433
- I'm ----ing so jealous.

18:10.433 --> 18:12.433
- He has naturally curly hair.

18:12.433 --> 18:15.066
- James, are you not feeling
good about your hair tonight?

18:15.066 --> 18:17.033
- Yeah.

18:17.033 --> 18:19.100
- It was that last time.

18:19.100 --> 18:21.600
I told you that last sweep.
I told you it was perfect.

18:21.600 --> 18:24.033
- But I feel like you're
the OG of that hair.

18:24.033 --> 18:26.500
- It's all right.
He can have it tonight.

18:26.500 --> 18:29.233
- Lisa, last year,
you fired James

18:29.233 --> 18:31.367
from Sur and Pump.

18:31.367 --> 18:33.166
What made you give him
another chance?

18:33.166 --> 18:36.433
- I knew that he had
to hold himself accountable

18:36.433 --> 18:38.367
for his actions,
and I have to say

18:38.367 --> 18:39.700
he has been there
twice a week,

18:39.700 --> 18:42.200
Tuesdays and Thursdays, right?

I think it's brilliant,
actually.

19:01.734 --> 19:03.400

19:03.400 --> 19:04.767

Tuesdays are really great,

Thirsty Sursdays.

19:09.200 --> 19:11.266

19:11.266 --> 19:13.100
We got to meet your father
this season.

19:13.100 --> 19:15.500
- Hey.
- Hi!

19:15.500 --> 19:17.533
- Just keeping it gangster.

19:17.533 --> 19:19.633
- London gangster.

19:19.633 --> 19:22.066
- You said
that in your London days,

19:22.066 --> 19:24.166
he was quite the
man about town.

19:24.166 --> 19:26.300
- Yeah, even I was wondering,
what's that like?

19:26.300 --> 19:28.166
- Because he was like that
with George Michael, you know,

19:28.166 --> 19:29.567
and he used to go everywhere
with him,

19:29.567 --> 19:32.100
and George Michael was at
the top of his game.

19:32.100 --> 19:34.133
- So George Michael was
your godfather.

19:34.133 --> 19:35.433
He managed him in the '80s.

19:35.433 --> 19:37.433
Did you spend holidays with him
as a kid?

19:37.433 --> 19:39.433
- Oh, yeah, like, all holidays,
you know?

19:39.433 --> 19:42.500
And then, like, eventually
he moved to California,

19:42.500 --> 19:45.166
so we would visit,
like, the house here.

19:45.166 --> 19:46.700
- When he passed away,
it was reported

19:46.700 --> 19:51.233
that he gave a lot of his money
to his godchildren.

19:51.233 --> 19:52.533
Did you--

19:52.533 --> 19:54.567
- That's all still, like,
in, like, works.

19:54.567 --> 19:56.433
I can't even comment on that,
'cause I have no idea.

19:56.433 --> 19:58.367
- Is your dad still--

19:58.367 --> 20:00.300
- Dad's still living in England

20:00.300 --> 20:03.667
but hopefully making moves
this year to come back.

20:03.667 --> 20:05.567
He just wants to be close
to his kids and--

20:05.567 --> 20:06.700
- How many siblings
do you have?

20:06.700 --> 20:07.700
- Two brothers.

20:07.700 --> 20:09.533
Two little brothers.

20:09.533 --> 20:11.200
- Yeah, very, very.

20:11.200 --> 20:13.133
- What is it about your dad,

20:13.133 --> 20:15.166
seeing him and him reappearing,

20:15.166 --> 20:16.600
that made you so emotional?

20:16.600 --> 20:17.700
- I don't know;
he's like my best friend,

20:17.700 --> 20:19.266
to see him, like, hurt

20:19.266 --> 20:21.266
or, like, to see how far
it's all come,

20:21.266 --> 20:22.400
from living in London

20:22.400 --> 20:24.266
and then, like,
moving to America

20:24.266 --> 20:27.133
and everything with George,
you know, not being able

20:27.133 --> 20:30.667
to really solidify something
before him passing,

20:30.667 --> 20:33.333
you know, just really weird
how it all just goes down.

20:33.333 --> 20:34.533
It's just been a long road,

20:34.533 --> 20:36.433
so it's just, like,
hard to see.

20:36.433 --> 20:38.600
And, um...

20:38.600 --> 20:40.200
- It's been tough,

20:40.200 --> 20:41.433
what your parents
have been through.

20:41.433 --> 20:43.266
- Yeah, been real tough.

20:43.266 --> 20:44.600
- That's taken a toll on James.

20:44.600 --> 20:46.200
- Yeah, and it's just
really cool

20:46.200 --> 20:48.166
to be able to, like,
have him see, like,

20:48.166 --> 20:50.200
you know,
how good I've been doing.

20:50.200 --> 20:52.467
- Kristen,
have you ever seen James be

20:52.467 --> 20:55.300
as vulnerable and emotional

20:55.300 --> 20:56.734
as when he was talking
about his dad?

20:56.734 --> 20:58.567
- Yeah, it was
really hard to watch.

20:58.567 --> 21:00.600
They were not going through
the divorce

21:00.600 --> 21:02.166
when we were dating,

21:02.166 --> 21:03.633
but they were going through
hard times,

21:03.633 --> 21:06.367
and I feel like--

21:06.367 --> 21:08.367
and I hope you don't
take this offensively.

21:08.367 --> 21:09.600
I felt like,
at that time, like,

21:09.600 --> 21:13.467
there was a lot of pressure
on three kids,

21:13.467 --> 21:15.500
'cause I even saw him
as sort of a kid,

21:15.500 --> 21:17.300
even though we were dating,

21:17.300 --> 21:18.633
and he was, like, ten years
younger than me, right?

21:18.633 --> 21:21.300
But it felt like there was
always a lot of pressure

21:21.300 --> 21:25.233
and a lot of weight
on three young boys

21:25.233 --> 21:27.700
that wasn't their problem.

21:27.700 --> 21:29.767
And I know that that was
really hard for him.

21:31.400 --> 21:34.333
- Scheana, you know,
Jax really pissed you off

21:34.333 --> 21:36.533
when he told people
that Rob said

21:36.533 --> 21:38.400
that he didn't love you.

21:38.400 --> 21:41.367
And you retaliated a little bit

21:41.367 --> 21:44.533
by setting Brittany up
with Adam.

21:44.533 --> 21:47.200
- Hey.
- Hi.

21:48.633 --> 21:49.734
- Hi, honey.
How are you doing?

21:51.533 --> 21:53.533
- So Brittany was
still living with Jax.

21:53.533 --> 21:54.734
They were still together.

21:54.734 --> 21:57.266
So why introduce her
to another guy?

21:57.266 --> 21:58.600
- We all were just
going out one night.

21:58.600 --> 22:00.500
I was just trying to
introduce Adam to the group.

22:00.500 --> 22:02.600
I wasn't, again, trying
to set them up.

22:02.600 --> 22:04.400
It wasn't like, "Brittany,
if you and Jax are together,

22:04.400 --> 22:05.734
I want you to cheat on him."

22:05.734 --> 22:08.266
- No, no, no, no,
it was retaliatory.

22:08.266 --> 22:10.200
- Wait, but you said
on camera that it was,

22:10.200 --> 22:11.367
that you were like,
"If he's gonna

22:11.367 --> 22:12.433
"with my relationship,

22:12.433 --> 22:14.000
then I'm gonna
with his."

22:14.000 --> 22:16.266
- I say dumb sh-- sometimes,
same as we all do.

22:16.266 --> 22:19.633
I was simply saying, "Look,
if this doesn't work out"--

22:19.633 --> 22:22.500
- Yeah, "Look how cute he is,
and let me invite him."

22:22.500 --> 22:24.400
- Jax,
watching Brittany with Adam,

22:24.400 --> 22:26.367
did you think she did
anything inappropriate?

22:26.367 --> 22:28.000
- No, she didn't.
Not at all.

22:30.233 --> 22:31.533
He's actually
a really nice guy.

22:31.533 --> 22:33.633
He actually pulled me aside
in the bathroom.

22:33.633 --> 22:35.433
He's like, "Hey, man, Scheana
told me to talk to her,"

22:35.433 --> 22:36.767
and he's like,
"Dude, I'm not interested.

22:36.767 --> 22:38.433
If that's your girlfriend,
that's"--

22:38.433 --> 22:39.767
He was actually polite
about it.

22:39.767 --> 22:41.000
And I thought
you were my friend,

22:41.000 --> 22:42.233
so for you to do that--

22:42.233 --> 22:43.567
- But I told you

22:43.567 --> 22:44.633
that I would always
choose her over you

22:44.633 --> 22:46.400
when you were in the wrong.

22:46.400 --> 22:47.667
We had this conversation
the day after she drove--

22:47.667 --> 22:48.700
- But to bring another guy
in there?

22:48.700 --> 22:50.433
I mean, for what?

22:50.433 --> 22:51.567
- I don't think

22:51.567 --> 22:53.033
she ever thought,

22:53.033 --> 22:55.400
"I'm gonna bring
another guy in

22:55.400 --> 22:57.266
to swoop Brittany up."

22:57.266 --> 23:01.066
It was all about
letting Britany know

23:01.066 --> 23:03.433
you should still
have confidence,

23:03.433 --> 23:05.433
because you're
a bangin' bitch.

23:05.433 --> 23:07.467
- I've said this 17 times.

23:07.467 --> 23:09.266
I wanted her to just see

23:09.266 --> 23:11.600
that there are other men
in this world other than you,

23:11.600 --> 23:13.600
because you were treating her
like sh--,

23:13.600 --> 23:15.600
and it was like, "Look, there
are other guys out there."

23:17.266 --> 23:19.000
- I think Adam's cute,
of course.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.400
- Yeah, he's cute.
- Yeah, you can't deny that.

23:21.400 --> 23:22.734
a cute guy?

23:22.734 --> 23:24.467
Nobody.

23:24.467 --> 23:26.667

- Yeah.

23:26.667 --> 23:29.066

Billie Lee, will join us.

23:40.433 --> 23:42.300

suddenly she's excited about
being asked out on a date,

23:44.467 --> 23:46.433

put a damper on it.

that it hurt your feelings.

24:06.467 --> 24:10.033
And joining us
is Sur's newest hostess,

24:10.033 --> 24:11.300
Billie Lee.

24:11.300 --> 24:12.633
Hi, Billie Lee.
- Hi.

24:14.233 --> 24:15.700
Tell me a little bit

24:15.700 --> 24:18.767
about your background,
your childhood.

24:18.767 --> 24:20.100
- I grew up in Indiana,

24:20.100 --> 24:22.400
and I felt the shame
in my town

24:22.400 --> 24:23.633
and with my parents.

24:23.633 --> 24:25.533
And I decided to make
the change

24:25.533 --> 24:28.367
and really transition
when I moved to LA.

24:28.367 --> 24:30.667
- Have you had difficulty
finding workplaces

24:30.667 --> 24:34.000
where you feel included
and accepted?

24:34.000 --> 24:36.467
- Yeah, I was trying to get
a job as a server,

24:36.467 --> 24:38.400
and you have to have, like,
your headshot and everything.

24:38.400 --> 24:39.600
And I was
in the awkward stage.

24:39.600 --> 24:41.500
"Is that a boy?
Is that a girl?"

24:41.500 --> 24:43.734
And, you know, it happens a lot
in the trans community.

24:43.734 --> 24:45.734
If people are in between

24:45.734 --> 24:47.467
or if they're expressing
their masculine energy

24:47.467 --> 24:49.066
a little bit more than others,

24:49.066 --> 24:51.667
people don't give them
the same opportunity.

24:51.667 --> 24:52.767
- Is that an LA thing,

24:52.767 --> 24:53.767
that you have to have
a headshot

24:53.767 --> 24:55.600
to get a job as a waiter?

24:56.667 --> 24:58.500
- Yes.
- Yeah.

24:58.500 --> 25:02.100
- You know, Sur is historically
a difficult place

25:02.100 --> 25:03.667
for new girls.

25:03.667 --> 25:07.433
But you seem to have been
welcomed with open arms.

25:07.433 --> 25:09.567
- Yeah, I've fallen in love
with so many people.

25:09.567 --> 25:12.033
it's like now
they're my family.

25:12.033 --> 25:14.567
- So nice from the very first
time I ever met her,

25:14.567 --> 25:15.767
just so nice and so kind.

25:15.767 --> 25:18.033
- Yeah, you have
amazing energy.

25:18.033 --> 25:20.166
- I have to admit
I was fascinated

25:20.166 --> 25:23.700
when you openly discussed
going to Thailand

25:23.700 --> 25:25.633
for a vagina.

25:25.633 --> 25:28.500
What was that
shopping process like?

25:28.500 --> 25:30.100
- It was so weird.

25:30.100 --> 25:31.567
I'd never even seen a vagina.

25:31.567 --> 25:33.133
Like, I've never been
with a woman.

25:33.133 --> 25:34.567
At the time, I was--
I'd never seen a vagina,

25:34.567 --> 25:36.500
and so shopping for it
was really weird.

25:36.500 --> 25:38.567
- Are you sure "shopping for
it" is the right terminology?

25:40.166 --> 25:43.467
- I know you and I have both
shopped for Chanel bags.

25:43.467 --> 25:46.000
You know when it's right, Lisa.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.133
Come on.

25:47.133 --> 25:48.667
- Actually, I looked at porn

25:48.667 --> 25:51.000
so I could say what vagina
looks really nice.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.600
So porn was my reference.

25:52.600 --> 25:55.000
- Well, those vaginas
are normally edited, right?

25:55.000 --> 25:57.033
- Well, I wanted
an edited, pretty vagina.

25:58.600 --> 26:00.433
- Lisa, do you love your vagina

26:00.433 --> 26:01.600
as much as Billie Lee
loves hers?

26:01.600 --> 26:03.400
- Probably not.

26:03.400 --> 26:06.066
I didn't choose mine.
I was born with it.

26:06.066 --> 26:07.066
I guess Ken does.
- Right.

26:07.066 --> 26:08.667
- Hopefully.

26:08.667 --> 26:10.400
- Billie Lee, what was
your first impression

26:10.400 --> 26:12.000
of Stassi when you met her?

26:12.000 --> 26:14.667
- She was nice, actually, yeah.

26:14.667 --> 26:16.600
- She invited you to be
on her podcast,

26:16.600 --> 26:19.200
but Ariana warned you
that she could be ignorant.

26:19.200 --> 26:22.066
Why did you think
Stassi was ignorant?

26:22.066 --> 26:25.233
- That came from something
that Stassi had said

26:25.233 --> 26:26.633
on her podcast.

26:26.633 --> 26:28.233
She was like,

26:28.233 --> 26:30.200
"Well, I don't know why
those people"...

26:30.200 --> 26:32.100
- "Those"--oh, my God.

26:32.100 --> 26:33.700
- "Always make awards shows
into a thing

26:33.700 --> 26:35.767
about politics and race."

26:35.767 --> 26:38.600
I hope you school Stassi's ass
on her ----ing privilege,

26:38.600 --> 26:42.433
because this bitch actually
takes pride in being ignorant.

26:42.433 --> 26:43.433
- You said
someone should school

26:43.433 --> 26:45.066
her white, privileged ass.

26:45.066 --> 26:46.567
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

26:46.567 --> 26:47.767
- And I knew Billie was
the kind of person

26:47.767 --> 26:49.467
who would do that

26:49.467 --> 26:52.200
in the most kindhearted
and wonderful way.

26:54.700 --> 26:56.100
- No, I don't think
she's a bigot,

26:56.100 --> 26:57.633
and I never called her racist.

26:57.633 --> 26:58.700
- And I never said "racist"
either.

26:58.700 --> 27:00.166
- No, no, no, no.

27:00.166 --> 27:02.700
Billie and I had spoken
so deeply

27:02.700 --> 27:06.066
about these exact types
of things,

27:06.066 --> 27:09.467
but I knew that Billie was
the person to handle it

27:09.467 --> 27:12.066
in the best way possible,
and I think she really did.

27:12.066 --> 27:14.133
- Lisa, you were
on Stassi's podcast.

27:14.133 --> 27:15.667
What do you think
of her interviewing skills?

27:15.667 --> 27:17.500
- Well, I'd had
a couple of drinks,

27:17.500 --> 27:19.633
so, you know, she took me
at a weak moment.

27:19.633 --> 27:21.266
Everything was pretty good

27:21.266 --> 27:23.133
until she asked me
something like,

27:23.133 --> 27:25.000
"Would you rather swim in sh--
or, I don't know, eat dead"--

27:25.000 --> 27:26.266
something ridiculous.

27:26.266 --> 27:28.066
- It was like sh--
or dead bodies.

27:28.066 --> 27:30.133
- Yeah, like, what has that
got to do with anything?

27:30.133 --> 27:31.233
You have a limited amount
of time.

27:31.233 --> 27:32.767
Ask me something else.

27:32.767 --> 27:34.533
- Billie Lee, how are things

27:34.533 --> 27:36.066
with Ariana's brother, Jeremy?

27:36.066 --> 27:37.200
Are you still dating?

27:37.200 --> 27:39.000
- We hang out, for sure.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.600
I kick it with him.

27:40.600 --> 27:43.000
- Yo, so what do you got
going on later this week?

27:43.000 --> 27:44.066
- Work and yoga.

27:44.066 --> 27:45.633
- I was thinking

27:45.633 --> 27:46.767
maybe we could go
grab a drink or something,

27:46.767 --> 27:48.100
get some food and hang out.

27:48.100 --> 27:50.700
- Yeah.
I'm down, yeah.

27:50.700 --> 27:53.033
- Kristen,
when Billie Lee told you

27:53.033 --> 27:55.233
she was going out with Jeremy,
you said,

27:55.233 --> 27:56.567
"Is it in a public place?"

27:56.567 --> 27:58.700
- Yeah.

27:58.700 --> 28:01.500
- Because I thought
he just wanted to bang her,

28:01.500 --> 28:04.033
based on my--not my personal
experience with Jeremy,

28:04.033 --> 28:06.266
'cause Jeremy's never tried
to bang me.

28:06.266 --> 28:09.667
I did witness him hitting on
a bunch of chicks.

28:09.667 --> 28:12.100
- Stassi,
you called him "creepy"

28:12.100 --> 28:15.567
and said that he tried to
hit on you at Katie's wedding.

28:15.567 --> 28:18.166
- Stop it.

28:18.166 --> 28:20.233
We're good.
We're good.

28:20.233 --> 28:23.166
- Most guys have had
their moments

28:23.166 --> 28:26.000
where they go
from girl to girl to girl,

28:26.000 --> 28:27.600
and you're like,
"Dude, I just told you

28:27.600 --> 28:30.200
that I'm in a relationship"
or "I just told you no."

28:30.200 --> 28:33.066
And everyone's drinking
too much, and that happens--

28:33.066 --> 28:34.734
- And it's creepy.

28:34.734 --> 28:36.133
- That is a creepy thing.

28:36.133 --> 28:38.000
- For Billie, you know,

28:38.000 --> 28:39.600
suddenly she's excited about
being asked out on a date,

28:39.600 --> 28:42.133
and then suddenly you guys
put a damper on it.

28:42.133 --> 28:44.533
- I had no idea
that it hurt your feelings.

28:44.533 --> 28:46.200
- When I'm about to go
on a date with him,

28:46.200 --> 28:47.266
you don't think
that's a big deal?

28:47.266 --> 28:48.600
- No, of course, of course.

28:48.600 --> 28:50.200
I wish you would have
said something.

28:50.200 --> 28:52.000
- I was thrown off by it,
because he was so kind,

28:52.000 --> 28:54.667
and everyone that we
hung out with were so nice,

28:54.667 --> 28:55.734
and I loved hanging out
with him.

28:55.734 --> 28:57.333
I've never got a creepy vibe.

28:57.333 --> 28:59.667
So when you guys told me that,
I was like, "What?

28:59.667 --> 29:01.734
I mean, I was excited,
and then it was like, "Oh."

29:01.734 --> 29:03.667
- So you still hang out
with Jeremy.

29:03.667 --> 29:04.734
Are you dating anyone?

29:04.734 --> 29:06.600
- No, I am single, yes.

29:06.600 --> 29:09.600
- Has your dating life improved
since you've been on the show?

29:09.600 --> 29:11.100
- No.

29:11.100 --> 29:12.767
- I have to think
that things are gonna look up.

29:12.767 --> 29:14.767
- They're gonna come a-running.
- I think you'll be all right.

29:14.767 --> 29:17.233
- Yeah, things are looking up.
- Congratulations.

29:17.233 --> 29:19.300
Well, thanks for joining us,
Billie Lee.

29:19.300 --> 29:21.200
We'll be right back.

29:22.767 --> 29:26.100
- I don't think there's one way
to be a feminist.

29:26.100 --> 29:27.633
- #MeToo.

29:27.633 --> 29:29.333
- No, Jax.

29:29.333 --> 29:30.767
- I thought it was
for women power!

29:30.767 --> 29:32.700
- That's not
what it means.

29:43.233 --> 29:46.633
- We're back with the
"Vanderpump Rules" reunion.

29:46.633 --> 29:50.133
Jax, we saw you trying to work
on yourself this season.

29:50.133 --> 29:52.667
You went to a reiki master
named Kelsey.

29:52.667 --> 29:54.066
Does the tapping really work?

29:55.667 --> 29:56.667
- I don't know.

29:56.667 --> 29:57.667
- Repeat after me.

29:57.667 --> 29:58.767
I have all this anger.

29:58.767 --> 29:59.767
- I have all this anger.

29:59.767 --> 30:00.767
- So I burst out.

30:00.767 --> 30:01.767
- So I burst out.

30:01.767 --> 30:02.767
- And I hurt people.

30:02.767 --> 30:04.533
- And I hurt people.

30:04.533 --> 30:06.600
- It seemed like it really
became therapy for you.

30:06.600 --> 30:08.333
- I don't like anything I saw.

30:08.333 --> 30:10.266
She was telling you
that you weren't into Brittany

30:10.266 --> 30:11.667
and that you were trying

30:11.667 --> 30:13.233
to come up with reasons
to leave her,

30:13.233 --> 30:14.667
and it was gross.

30:14.667 --> 30:17.000
The things she said to you
were so inappropriate.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.767
- She seemed like
just massaging his ego.

30:18.767 --> 30:20.734
- You need to let her go.
- Yeah.

30:20.734 --> 30:24.200
"Don't go on this trip.
Why are you even going?"

30:24.200 --> 30:26.000
- She doesn't even know
what she's talking about.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.133
She doesn't know
any of the background,

30:27.133 --> 30:28.266
so how dare you say that?

30:28.266 --> 30:30.133
- She talked to you,
and her voice,

30:30.133 --> 30:32.266
it was like she changed
her voice to a sex operator.

30:32.266 --> 30:34.567
- Then they would hug
for way too long.

30:43.166 --> 30:46.033
- Jax, how did you start saying
"I love you" to her?

30:46.033 --> 30:48.300
- To the reiki--to Kelsey.

30:48.300 --> 30:50.700
- I'm really, really proud
of you.

30:50.700 --> 30:52.033
- Thank you.
- Really proud of you.

30:52.033 --> 30:53.300
- Thank you. Love you.

30:53.300 --> 30:54.633
Talk to you
in, like, a week or so.

30:54.633 --> 30:56.000
- Okay, sounds good, honey.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
- Okay, bye.
See you later.

31:00.033 --> 31:02.033
Oh!
She always makes me happy.

31:02.033 --> 31:03.567
I did say that?
- Yeah.

31:03.567 --> 31:05.266
- It was also kind of stunning

31:05.266 --> 31:09.233
watching you lay out croissants
and incest and--

31:09.233 --> 31:11.567
- I'm sorry.

31:13.200 --> 31:16.333
I mean lay out incense
when she was coming over.

31:16.333 --> 31:17.734
- She's coming to my house.

31:17.734 --> 31:19.600
I wanted to make my house
look presentable.

31:19.600 --> 31:21.133
- You guys are putting the most
salacious slant on this.

31:21.133 --> 31:23.667
- Oh, stop it.

31:23.667 --> 31:25.200
- There was nothing sexual
about it.

31:25.200 --> 31:27.333
- Come on.
That's bullsh--.

31:27.333 --> 31:29.066
- Guys.

31:29.066 --> 31:30.734
It was quite a moment
when you asked Kelsey

31:30.734 --> 31:33.200
to call you by your real name,
Jason.

31:33.200 --> 31:35.200
Why let a reiki specialist

31:35.200 --> 31:39.133
who you really had just known
for a couple months

31:39.133 --> 31:41.333
use your real name
and your girlfriend...

31:41.333 --> 31:42.734
- Because I'm trying to get
to the bottom--

31:42.734 --> 31:44.333
- You've never let her do this.

31:44.333 --> 31:46.333
- No, she--
- You've never asked her to--

31:46.333 --> 31:48.033
- I mean, I call you--

31:48.033 --> 31:49.300
I try to call you "Jason"
around your parents,

31:49.300 --> 31:51.300
but you never asked me
to call me.

31:51.300 --> 31:53.433
- Brittany,
did that threaten you?

31:53.433 --> 31:55.300
Or how did you feel about that?
- No.

31:55.300 --> 31:57.166
She always calls me
by my real name.

31:57.166 --> 31:59.233
- Back then, whenever
I was hearing about it,

31:59.233 --> 32:00.700
I didn't think
anything of it.

32:00.700 --> 32:02.433
Watching it where she was
just like, "Oh!"

32:02.433 --> 32:05.066
Like, it turned into heart eyes
or something.

32:05.066 --> 32:07.166
When you said that,
it was like googly eyes.

32:07.166 --> 32:10.233
It was like the heart emoji
in real life.

32:12.633 --> 32:14.166
- Kristen, after all you girls

32:14.166 --> 32:16.033
tried to get Brittany
to leave Jax,

32:16.033 --> 32:17.233
you flew her mom
and her sister out.

32:17.233 --> 32:18.767
Why?

32:18.767 --> 32:20.700
- She kept saying
she wanted to go home,

32:20.700 --> 32:22.200
and right around this time,

32:22.200 --> 32:24.367
when I chose to fly
her family out,

32:24.367 --> 32:27.467
she just kept expressing, like,
"I want my mama.

32:27.467 --> 32:29.066
I just want to come home."

32:29.066 --> 32:31.066
And I seriously, seriously
got nervous

32:31.066 --> 32:34.633
that she would go back
to Kentucky and not come back.

32:34.633 --> 32:36.734
So I'm like,
"If Brittany needs her mama,

32:36.734 --> 32:38.200
her mama's coming here."

32:38.200 --> 32:40.233
- Jax, were you more irritated

32:40.233 --> 32:42.266
that Kristen blindsided you

32:42.266 --> 32:44.266
or that you had to sit down
and face...

32:44.266 --> 32:46.100
- Yeah.

32:46.100 --> 32:47.000
- I wanted to deal
with this internally.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.467
I wanted to make this just
her and us,

32:49.467 --> 32:51.066
and I didn't want
to have everybody know

32:51.066 --> 32:52.767
and everybody get involved

32:52.767 --> 32:54.667
and everybody chime in with
what they were dealing with,

32:54.667 --> 32:56.133
because I just felt like,

32:56.133 --> 32:58.400
"I'm never gonna get a say
in anything."

32:58.400 --> 33:01.667
And then, you know,
her decisions would be just

33:01.667 --> 33:03.633
messed up because she's being
influenced by everybody else.

33:03.633 --> 33:04.633
That's what I thought.

33:04.633 --> 33:07.400
- When you took her mom
and her sister out,

33:07.400 --> 33:10.467
you started the meal by saying,
"I don't wanna bash Brittany."

33:10.467 --> 33:14.133
Then you go on to complain
that she sleeps until 1:00

33:14.133 --> 33:15.734
and she eats all day.

33:15.734 --> 33:18.000
Are you that much more
productive than she is?

33:18.000 --> 33:19.367
- No, I'm not.

33:19.367 --> 33:22.033
I was just looking for reasons
to, like--resentment.

33:22.033 --> 33:23.367
just cowardly reasons

33:23.367 --> 33:25.033
to start arguments,
to start fights, to--

33:25.033 --> 33:27.266
- Brittany, you know
this sh

33:27.266 --> 33:28.700
- No, I do.

33:28.700 --> 33:30.166
- As this is being said
out loud, even though--

33:30.166 --> 33:31.433
- No, I know.

33:31.433 --> 33:33.166
- I don't want you
to go back to this place

33:33.166 --> 33:35.233
and ever thinking that any of
that bullsh-- is true.

33:35.233 --> 33:36.500
- No, I know.
I know.

33:36.500 --> 33:38.266
No matter what happened, like,

33:38.266 --> 33:40.033
I know I didn't deserve
what I went through.

33:40.033 --> 33:41.133
I know that.

33:41.133 --> 33:42.433
- Lisa, what was your reaction

33:42.433 --> 33:45.266
to Sherri forgiving Jax
so quickly?

33:45.266 --> 33:47.367
- I'm not happy with myself,
not even a little bit.

33:47.367 --> 33:49.500
- That makes me sad.
- It makes me sad too.

33:49.500 --> 33:51.033
I'm a selfish, terrible person.

33:51.033 --> 33:52.233
- I'll give you
a second chance,

33:52.233 --> 33:54.300
and I don't, you know,
give up on you.

33:54.300 --> 33:56.300
And you know I love you.

33:56.300 --> 33:58.433
- Well, I was surprised,

33:58.433 --> 34:01.734
but I think she's got
very much the quality

34:01.734 --> 34:04.033
that Brittany's inherited
from her.

34:04.033 --> 34:05.333
- That's just my mom.

34:05.333 --> 34:07.333
She's the best woman
I've ever known,

34:07.333 --> 34:08.467
best woman
I think I ever will know.

34:08.467 --> 34:10.066
She taught me to forgive.

34:10.066 --> 34:11.166
She taught me to be
a good person

34:11.166 --> 34:13.066
and just treat everybody fairly

34:13.066 --> 34:16.066
and just try to see the best
in everybody.

34:16.066 --> 34:17.734
And some people might think
that's a bad thing,

34:17.734 --> 34:19.333
but I'm proud of my mom,

34:19.333 --> 34:20.467
and I'm proud of the person
that I am.

34:20.467 --> 34:22.133
- She's amazing.

34:22.133 --> 34:23.467
- So if I choose to be happy
and positive,

34:23.467 --> 34:25.467
then that's better
than being negative

34:25.467 --> 34:28.467
and holding in big grudges
your whole life.

34:28.467 --> 34:30.467
They end up with tumors
that way, not me.

34:32.433 --> 34:36.300
- Lala, you spoke a lot
about feminism this season.

34:36.300 --> 34:39.066
It was a goal of yours
to unite all the women.

34:39.066 --> 34:41.200
You talked about
"power to the pussy."

34:41.200 --> 34:44.467
What is your definition
of feminism?

34:44.467 --> 34:47.033
- It's different
to everybody else's.

34:47.033 --> 34:48.333
That's for sure.

34:48.333 --> 34:50.367
- Yeah, and I don't think
there's one way

34:50.367 --> 34:54.166
to, you know, portray
being a feminist.

34:54.166 --> 34:57.033
For me, the female body
is beautiful,

34:57.033 --> 34:59.500
and if you want to bring
your tits out

34:59.500 --> 35:01.367
to do this, that,
and the other,

35:01.367 --> 35:02.767
you just do you, boo.

35:04.100 --> 35:05.300
- Well, Lisa, do you agree

35:05.300 --> 35:07.467
with Lala's idea
of New Age feminism?

35:07.467 --> 35:08.567
- Well, not exactly.

35:08.567 --> 35:10.333
I mean, I love Lala,
but, I mean,

35:10.333 --> 35:12.500
she's not exactly
the quintessential feminist

35:12.500 --> 35:15.100
if she's talking about,
"Well, I give a BJ,

35:15.100 --> 35:16.200
and I get the jewelry"
and all that.

35:16.200 --> 35:17.500
That's not exactly, you know--

35:17.500 --> 35:19.367
- Well, keep in mind
I'm blowing my boyfriend.

35:19.367 --> 35:21.100
I'm not blowing
some random guy.

35:21.100 --> 35:23.066
- I know, but it's
a bit of an oxymoron.

35:23.066 --> 35:25.000
But I do adore her,

35:25.000 --> 35:26.400
and a lot of it is said
with humor.

35:26.400 --> 35:28.266
- To your point, Lala,
a lot of feminists

35:28.266 --> 35:29.367
may not agree...

35:29.367 --> 35:30.533
- Exactly.

35:30.533 --> 35:32.133
- With your idea of feminism

35:32.133 --> 35:33.333
since you drive a car

35:33.333 --> 35:35.133
that is paid for by your guy.

35:35.133 --> 35:38.600
And you have been known
to body shame other women,

35:38.600 --> 35:41.066
like Katie and Stassi
last year.

35:41.066 --> 35:42.266
You told them
that they haven't been working

35:42.266 --> 35:43.266
on their summer bodies.

35:43.266 --> 35:44.333
- Yes.

35:44.333 --> 35:45.367
- How do these things fit

35:45.367 --> 35:47.100
into your brand of girl power?

35:47.100 --> 35:49.400
- When I feel like
I'm under attack

35:49.400 --> 35:51.266
and backed in a corner,

35:51.266 --> 35:53.400
I go for whatever is, like,
your biggest insec--

35:53.400 --> 35:55.133
- That's what I do too,
but you judge me so hard.

35:55.133 --> 35:57.100
- I'm speaking.
- Stop, James.

35:57.100 --> 35:58.400
- But that's exactly--
- I'm speaking.

35:58.400 --> 36:00.133
- It's the same thing.
- I'm speaking.

36:00.133 --> 36:02.000
Thank you.
- But it's the same thing.

36:02.000 --> 36:05.400
- Stassi, what's your take
on Lala's feminism?

36:05.400 --> 36:07.567
- It's not my brand of feminism
but it's hers,

36:07.567 --> 36:10.100
so that's her truth.

36:10.100 --> 36:12.166
That's her--yeah.

36:12.166 --> 36:14.433
- And I'm not asking anyone
to take on my brand of--

36:14.433 --> 36:16.400
I've never considered myself
a feminist.

36:16.400 --> 36:18.133
I just consider myself

36:18.133 --> 36:20.100
giving power to the pussy,
to be honest.

36:20.100 --> 36:21.433
- Well...

36:21.433 --> 36:24.100
Ariana, what do you think
about women

36:24.100 --> 36:27.233
who use their looks
to get stuff given to them?

36:27.233 --> 36:29.033
- I think you have
the power

36:29.033 --> 36:31.233
to do whatever you want
with whatever you have.

36:31.233 --> 36:34.633
I think that's part of
what being a feminist

36:34.633 --> 36:38.300
or being a woman
or being whoever is all about.

36:40.266 --> 36:43.266
- I think the confidence and
everything that she portrays

36:43.266 --> 36:45.567
and she talks about with, like,
women and everything,

36:45.567 --> 36:48.333
I think that's great because
whenever I gained weight

36:48.333 --> 36:50.467
and I had so many grown women
commenting on me

36:50.467 --> 36:52.667
about how fat I was or,
you know, anything like that,

36:52.667 --> 36:54.433
it's really, really hard.

36:54.433 --> 36:56.166
And I think women need
to support each other

36:56.166 --> 36:57.333
and lift each other up

36:57.333 --> 36:59.066
and not tear each other down
and--

36:59.066 --> 37:01.166
especially when you don't even
know the person.

37:01.166 --> 37:02.667
You don't know what anybody's
going through ever,

37:02.667 --> 37:04.066
so you should never judge.

37:05.133 --> 37:06.567
- #MeToo.

37:08.200 --> 37:10.066
- He didn't mean it
in that sense.

37:10.066 --> 37:11.567
- I don't think he understands
what he's saying.

37:11.567 --> 37:13.200
- I don't think you're the guy
to--

37:13.200 --> 37:14.600
- Doesn't that mean that--
- No, Jax.

37:14.600 --> 37:16.066
- No.

37:16.066 --> 37:17.400
- No.
- It's okay.

37:17.400 --> 37:19.467
- I thought it was
for women power.

37:19.467 --> 37:21.400
I thought it was
for women power!

37:21.400 --> 37:23.467
- That's not what it means.

37:25.200 --> 37:26.700
- Never mind.
I'll explain it to you later.

37:26.700 --> 37:29.166
- We'll tell you at lunch.

37:30.233 --> 37:32.100
- Thank you for being there
for me

37:32.100 --> 37:33.600
and not giving up hope.

37:45.633 --> 37:47.633
- Katie and Tom,

37:47.633 --> 37:49.300
you seem to be dealing

37:49.300 --> 37:51.367
with your anger
differently, Katie.

37:51.367 --> 37:55.100
Or you don't seem as angry, or
you're drinking less tequila,

37:55.100 --> 37:56.166
or what is happening?

37:56.166 --> 37:57.367
- A lot of things, I guess.

37:57.367 --> 38:00.367
I definitely took inventory
of my life

38:00.367 --> 38:02.066
and what was important.

38:02.066 --> 38:04.567
When I just became more loving
and accepting of myself,

38:04.567 --> 38:06.633
I became an easier person
to love.

38:06.633 --> 38:09.233
And I wanted, you know, us
to have more respect,

38:09.233 --> 38:11.667
and I love him
so, so, so much.

38:11.667 --> 38:14.533
- Does Schwartz's dick
work better this season?

38:14.533 --> 38:15.667
- Oh, thank you, Andy.

38:15.667 --> 38:18.633
Nice, nice.
Classy.

38:18.633 --> 38:21.133
- Yeah, she knocked the dust
off the other day.

38:21.133 --> 38:22.734
- There's some cobwebs,
but, you know...

38:22.734 --> 38:26.266
- Schwartz, how do you feel
about her new rational side?

38:26.266 --> 38:28.533
- I feel comfortable saying
this sitting right next to you,

38:28.533 --> 38:30.266
because we're in a better place
than we've ever been,

38:30.266 --> 38:31.734
and I love you so much,
but for a long time,

38:31.734 --> 38:33.500
she was a nightmare
of a human being.

38:33.500 --> 38:35.266
And I was--

38:36.367 --> 38:37.667
- No, of course not.
- No.

38:37.667 --> 38:39.533
- Katie, a lot of us
were very moved

38:39.533 --> 38:43.133
watching the old video of you
after your accident.

38:43.133 --> 38:44.500
Tell me what happened.

38:44.500 --> 38:48.467
- In 2009, I was at
my friend's apartment,

38:48.467 --> 38:49.467
and we decided
to go on the roof.

38:49.467 --> 38:50.667
We were taking pictures.

38:50.667 --> 38:53.533
I said, "Hey,
look at this skylight."

38:53.533 --> 38:55.567
So I sat on the edge of it,

38:55.567 --> 38:57.367
and it ended up breaking,
and I fell.

38:57.367 --> 38:58.533
It was about 25 feet.

38:58.533 --> 39:03.367
And I broke my shoulder,
collarbone,

39:03.367 --> 39:06.300
pretty much all of my ribs,
my jaw in two places,

39:06.300 --> 39:09.400
and I had a brain injury,
a subdural hematoma,

39:09.400 --> 39:11.700
which is bleeding
between the brain

39:11.700 --> 39:13.533
and, like,
what surrounds the brain,

39:13.533 --> 39:15.700
which is very serious.

39:15.700 --> 39:18.000
- That video you made,
even back then, was--

39:18.000 --> 39:19.633
I couldn't stop crying.

39:19.633 --> 39:21.667
- Doctors all around me,

39:21.667 --> 39:25.166
poking me, asking me questions,
what my name is.

39:25.166 --> 39:28.767
My stitches were just
open, gaping wounds.

39:28.767 --> 39:32.367
And it's really attractive.

39:32.367 --> 39:34.200
I've even missing some teeth.

39:34.200 --> 39:35.567
Hey!

39:35.567 --> 39:38.533
Everything has been put
into perspective.

39:41.166 --> 39:42.567
- It was surreal watching it.

39:42.567 --> 39:44.333
I hadn't seen it
for a long time,

39:44.333 --> 39:46.467
and that was seven days
after it happened,

39:46.467 --> 39:49.300
and you could see,
obviously, I was--

39:49.300 --> 39:52.033
- You were, like,
full-on Kanye West.

39:52.033 --> 39:54.734
- Do you think the accident
affected your anger issues?

39:54.734 --> 39:56.467
- Oh, 100%, and I ignored it,

39:56.467 --> 39:58.467
and I didn't want to talk
about it to people.

39:58.467 --> 40:02.033
I didn't want to talk
about depression.

40:02.033 --> 40:03.734
- I've always been fascinated
with how, you know,

40:03.734 --> 40:06.300
simultaneously fragile
and resilient we are,

40:06.300 --> 40:07.700
the human bodies and the mind.

40:07.700 --> 40:09.667
And, you know, I was
an exercise physiology major.

40:09.667 --> 40:13.200
I'm no--I'm no neurologist
or anything like that, but--

40:15.734 --> 40:18.633
- So anyways, in the back
of my mind, during some of

40:18.633 --> 40:21.233
the more tumultuous phases
in our relationship,

40:21.233 --> 40:23.367
you know,
that was a consideration.

40:23.367 --> 40:25.333
And it's such a hard thing.

40:25.333 --> 40:26.767
How do you even bring that up?

40:26.767 --> 40:28.367
- I always wanted her to tell
her story, though,

40:28.367 --> 40:29.700
because I felt that it was

40:29.700 --> 40:32.467
such a kind of important part
of her life,

40:32.467 --> 40:34.500
but I never felt
that she played the victim.

40:34.500 --> 40:36.633
A lot of people would draw back
on that and say,

40:36.633 --> 40:38.734
"Well, this is what happened
to me, and this is why"--

40:38.734 --> 40:40.367
But she never did that.

40:40.367 --> 40:42.066
I mean, she barely ever
mentioned it.

40:42.066 --> 40:43.633
So I'm happy that you actually
got to share that story.

40:43.633 --> 40:45.300
- I didn't want to.

40:45.300 --> 40:47.467
I had a bad relationship
with myself and my body,

40:47.467 --> 40:49.567
and that affected
my relationship with him

40:49.567 --> 40:50.734
and all of my friends.

40:50.734 --> 40:52.600
And in the last year,
I realized

40:52.600 --> 40:54.467
I've not been happy
for a long time.

40:54.467 --> 40:56.500
And I'd done a lot of work
on myself,

40:56.500 --> 40:58.767
and I was really proud
as to how far I'd come

40:58.767 --> 41:00.533
to just accept myself again.

41:00.533 --> 41:03.367
But I could not be happier.

41:03.367 --> 41:05.266
- It was such a magical moment,
seeing her

41:05.266 --> 41:09.000
finally regain full control
of who I knew she was

41:09.000 --> 41:11.400
and who I fell in love with
in the first place.

41:11.400 --> 41:13.000
It was like--it was just
a little moment

41:13.000 --> 41:15.767
in our apartment, but it was
such a special moment.

41:15.767 --> 41:18.000
Oh, my angel.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.667
- It feels so good.
It feels so good.

41:20.667 --> 41:22.400
- I know.

41:22.400 --> 41:25.066
- It feels so good
to feel good about myself.

41:25.066 --> 41:28.100
- Yeah. I knew
she was always in there.

41:28.100 --> 41:29.667
It's good to have
yourself back.

41:29.667 --> 41:31.367
- That conversation
that you guys had

41:31.367 --> 41:32.533
in your apartment

41:32.533 --> 41:34.533
was one of
the most moving things

41:34.533 --> 41:36.266
I've ever maybe seen.

41:36.266 --> 41:38.667
- It was six years
in the making, five years.

41:38.667 --> 41:40.000
And then we had been
to hell and back.

41:40.000 --> 41:41.633
- It was amazing to see.

41:41.633 --> 41:42.767
- It just felt like
such a turning point

41:42.767 --> 41:45.400
in our relationship,
and--yeah.

41:45.400 --> 41:47.100
I love you.
I'm glad we--

41:47.100 --> 41:48.567
- Thank you for being there
for me...

41:48.567 --> 41:50.767
- Of course.
- And not giving up hope.

41:50.767 --> 41:52.500
- And thank you
for not giving up on me

41:52.500 --> 41:53.667
and putting up
with my sh-- too.

41:53.667 --> 41:55.567
Yeah, I love you.

41:59.533 --> 42:02.100
- Thank you for sharing that.

42:07.433 --> 42:09.767
Next week,
the dramatic conclusion

42:09.767 --> 42:12.033
of the "Vanderpump Rules"
reunion.

42:12.033 --> 42:14.667
- We've all worked at Sur.
We haven't quit.

42:14.667 --> 42:17.633
She comes back, and you hand
her a position of power?

42:17.633 --> 42:20.100
She should have had to waitress
like the rest of us.

42:20.100 --> 42:24.166
- A rumor emerged
that James and Kristen

42:24.166 --> 42:25.533
hooked up together.

42:25.533 --> 42:27.400
- That's a giant
bullsh-- rumor.

42:27.400 --> 42:29.600
- He full-on admitted it
at the golf course.

42:29.600 --> 42:31.400
- No, I didn't!

42:31.400 --> 42:33.066
- I get dumped in the end.

42:33.066 --> 42:35.433
It was hard. It was
really, really ----ed up.

42:35.433 --> 42:37.066
are you doing, man?

42:37.066 --> 42:38.567
- I honestly thought
I was doing the right thing.

42:38.567 --> 42:40.433
- Then why did you
hook up with her?

42:40.433 --> 42:42.166
- When your relationship's
this unpredictable,

42:42.166 --> 42:43.734
you should take contraception.

42:43.734 --> 42:45.467
Let me buy you a condom.

42:45.467 --> 42:47.467
- Shut up. She called you
a whore for years.

42:47.467 --> 42:48.734
- Stop telling me to shut up.

42:48.734 --> 42:50.333
- Now you're best friends
with her.

42:52.333 --> 42:55.066
- She's so dramatic.
I can't even take it.

42:55.066 --> 42:56.433
- I don't like when he just--
I'm sorry.

42:56.433 --> 42:57.734
- Shut up, Kristen.

42:57.734 --> 43:00.166
- Yes, I was talking to James.
Listen to me.

43:00.166 --> 43:02.100
- All right, buh-bye.
Adios.

43:02.100 --> 43:05.667
