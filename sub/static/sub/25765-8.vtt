00:00.033 --> 00:02.270
Previously on "Better Call Saul"...

00:02.275 --> 00:03.608
It's territory, isn't it?

00:03.610 --> 00:05.643
The cartel can't give
it to the Salamancas,

00:05.645 --> 00:07.312
so I think they gave it to you.

00:07.314 --> 00:08.545
You have more to do.

00:08.547 --> 00:10.547
We are not even halfway done.

00:10.549 --> 00:14.151
- They need fresh air and, uh...
- Rest and relaxation.

00:14.153 --> 00:16.486
I would help people myself if I could.

00:16.488 --> 00:17.688
Yep.

00:17.690 --> 00:19.957
How can you justify
giving Babineaux 18 months?

00:19.959 --> 00:22.993
Our only witness is a
scumbag disbarred lawyer!

00:22.995 --> 00:25.930
If you say this is the only
way we can legitimately do this,

00:25.932 --> 00:26.997
it's the only way.

00:26.999 --> 00:28.465
Jimmy, whatever you're doing, don't.

00:28.467 --> 00:29.533
I have a better way.

00:37.643 --> 00:38.808
I think I got everything.

00:38.810 --> 00:40.143
If I forgot anything,

00:40.145 --> 00:42.379
I'll just, uh, figure it out on the way.

00:42.381 --> 00:43.880
You're back on Thursday?

00:43.882 --> 00:48.385
Thursday, yeah, unless
we break down in Amarillo.

00:53.692 --> 00:58.027
Kim, I want you to know, um,
I don't take this for granted.

00:58.029 --> 00:59.863
It means a lot.

01:03.034 --> 01:05.101
I'll see ya Thursday.

03:03.353 --> 03:05.119
Can I sit here?

03:05.121 --> 03:08.455
Uh... sure, man.

03:08.457 --> 03:10.624
Uh, just a word of warning...

03:10.626 --> 03:13.560
uh, I had a pile of cheese chili fries

03:13.562 --> 03:15.897
back at Stuckey's with onions on top.

03:15.899 --> 03:18.232
The last guy who sat here
didn't last five miles,

03:18.234 --> 03:22.136
but, uh, yeah, you're welcome to it.

04:20.595 --> 04:21.726
Ah, Jynetta.

04:21.728 --> 04:23.563
Very nice.

04:23.565 --> 04:25.230
I like the hearts over the i's.

04:25.232 --> 04:27.600
- It's a real nice touch.
- Thank you.

04:27.602 --> 04:29.134
- Ahhh, how many we got?
- 10.

04:29.136 --> 04:30.536
10.

04:30.538 --> 04:33.573
All righty.

04:33.575 --> 04:35.207
Would you like to do some postcards?

04:35.209 --> 04:36.741
It's 50 cents per.

04:36.743 --> 04:38.110
Yeah.

04:38.112 --> 04:40.245
- Different pens, please.
- Okay.

04:43.050 --> 04:44.450
Oh, Bubba.

04:44.452 --> 04:45.750
Hey.

04:45.752 --> 04:51.156
Uh, okay. I like your passion, but, uh,

04:51.158 --> 04:53.592
just maybe tone down the anger.

04:53.594 --> 04:56.095
Make it that you're... you're sad

04:56.097 --> 04:58.097
that you even have to write the letter.

04:58.099 --> 05:00.466
"I couldn't believe people
could be so heartless

05:00.468 --> 05:02.434
till I heard about you," okay?

05:02.436 --> 05:03.802
Okay. Yeah, I gotchu.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.437
- How many have we got?
- Five.

05:05.439 --> 05:07.139
All right.

05:07.141 --> 05:08.573
Would you like another batch?

05:08.575 --> 05:10.941
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

05:10.943 --> 05:13.111
All right.

05:13.113 --> 05:15.179
Different, uhh, pens.

05:16.816 --> 05:19.117
Uh, Chastity, let's see what you've got.

05:20.953 --> 05:22.186
Uh, don't...

05:22.188 --> 05:24.855
don't use, uh, swears.

05:24.857 --> 05:27.525
I thought we talked about respect.

05:27.527 --> 05:31.095
We're gonna have to lose that one.

07:30.851 --> 07:33.585
I'm a little light, yo.
Couldn't do nothing about it.

07:33.587 --> 07:37.523
Some dumbass festival over at
the fairground, Indian shit.

07:37.525 --> 07:39.189
Five-o was all over.

07:39.191 --> 07:41.258
Well, not real five-o...
like, the rentals.

07:41.260 --> 07:43.093
But you can't sell in
front of them, neither.

07:43.095 --> 07:45.830
We gonna make you right next time.

07:45.832 --> 07:47.431
You're goddamn right you will.

07:47.433 --> 07:50.300
For sure. Next week.

07:55.842 --> 07:58.142
Hey.

07:58.144 --> 08:00.310
Come here.

08:00.812 --> 08:03.981
- Nacho, man, I got to gettin'...
- Shh, shh, shh.

08:03.983 --> 08:06.150
Just come here.

08:12.158 --> 08:14.724
What's, uh... what's up?

08:23.535 --> 08:25.735
Aah!

08:25.737 --> 08:27.503
Shit.

08:44.856 --> 08:50.225
What you owe, you owe. With interest.

09:12.349 --> 09:14.516
You had to do that, man.

09:14.518 --> 09:16.218
Guy's not gonna learn otherwise.

09:16.220 --> 09:18.520
Mm-hmm.

09:18.522 --> 09:21.389
So, why didn't you do it?

09:27.030 --> 09:29.063
What up, Domingo?

10:00.896 --> 10:02.896
... this can include headache, nausea,

10:02.898 --> 10:04.497
dizziness, and vision changes.

10:04.499 --> 10:06.432
The committee is the proper place...

10:09.104 --> 10:11.271
But she wasn't the only witness that...

10:19.948 --> 10:23.316
... and I just want
to show you the real...

10:23.318 --> 10:25.152
And if you want to use the scrub, too...

10:26.655 --> 10:28.655
It's just that simple.

10:28.657 --> 10:31.424
Mmm. Smells like fresh
lavender, too, ladies, and...

10:31.426 --> 10:33.826
Hey, baby. You're in early.

10:33.828 --> 10:35.127
You in for the night?

10:35.129 --> 10:37.663
Want us to make you some dinner?

10:37.665 --> 10:39.098
... takes the color right out

10:39.100 --> 10:41.000
and this bottle has smoothing agents

10:41.002 --> 10:43.035
that protect your skin
while exfoliating...

10:43.037 --> 10:44.970
Thanks, babe.

10:44.972 --> 10:46.438
Are you gonna smoke with us?

10:46.440 --> 10:48.708
Look at that! This is the best.

10:48.710 --> 10:51.276
It's just... Well, I
think that's incredible,

10:51.278 --> 10:53.846
and I cannot believe
we're still offering this

10:53.848 --> 10:56.481
for under $70...

14:09.246 --> 14:13.214
Did you know, Michael, my
father was also engineer.

14:13.216 --> 14:14.616
Yeah.

14:14.618 --> 14:17.051
Worked from the day
he could hold a hammer.

14:17.053 --> 14:20.255
Learned the work from doing the work.

14:20.257 --> 14:22.824
Hands like knots of a tree.

14:24.928 --> 14:26.895
You see over there?

14:26.897 --> 14:28.330
He built that.

14:31.401 --> 14:33.601
The Sydney Opera House?

14:33.603 --> 14:38.238
Those concrete arches...
impossible in 1957.

14:38.240 --> 14:41.676
Six years it took to
solve the problem... six...

14:41.678 --> 14:45.613
and years more to pour correctly.

14:45.615 --> 14:49.684
To that, my father
gave 10 years of life.

14:49.686 --> 14:51.319
Another stout?

14:51.321 --> 14:53.688
Uh, you know, could I get the, uh...

14:53.690 --> 14:55.423
the "Heefiweesen" this time.

14:55.425 --> 14:57.191
- Oh!
- Sure.

14:57.193 --> 14:58.992
Uh, no, sir, please.

14:58.994 --> 15:01.929
Uh, it's "Hefeweizen."

15:01.931 --> 15:04.932
Oh, I'm sorry. How d'you say it?

15:04.934 --> 15:06.633
Hefeweizen.

15:06.635 --> 15:07.801
Hefeweizen.

15:07.803 --> 15:08.836
Vollkom richtig.

15:10.639 --> 15:13.841
Ah, uh... it's on me.

15:13.843 --> 15:16.509
Oh. Thanks, man.

15:21.817 --> 15:22.983
Prost.

15:25.888 --> 15:28.488
Where was I? Ah, the opera.

15:28.490 --> 15:30.557
It's for the ages.

15:30.559 --> 15:33.626
For my father, it was his achievement,

15:33.628 --> 15:35.562
a creation that will endure.

15:38.400 --> 15:39.799
Ja.

15:39.801 --> 15:43.169
What about you, Michael?

15:43.171 --> 15:45.972
Your papa... what did he do?

15:47.008 --> 15:50.142
My dad?

15:50.144 --> 15:53.379
Oh...

15:53.381 --> 15:56.382
left behind a cold-water
flat and a stack of bills.

15:56.384 --> 15:57.416
That's about all.

15:57.418 --> 15:59.218
Ah, not true.

15:59.220 --> 16:01.653
He also left you, Michael.

16:01.655 --> 16:03.256
You are his legacy.

16:05.593 --> 16:06.993
Yeah.

16:06.995 --> 16:08.194
You ever think about having kids,

16:08.196 --> 16:10.229
being a papa yourself?

16:12.233 --> 16:14.566
Once maybe.

16:17.671 --> 16:19.872
My Margarethe,

16:19.874 --> 16:23.108
she's... enough for me.

16:23.110 --> 16:26.344
She's my heart.

16:26.346 --> 16:30.181
This is the longest I've
ever been away from her.

16:30.783 --> 16:33.752
26 years,

16:33.754 --> 16:37.556
never this long away from home.

16:41.061 --> 16:42.594
To home.

16:42.596 --> 16:43.762
Yeah.

16:46.534 --> 16:48.166
Hey, Mike.

16:54.908 --> 16:57.007
I've got check on the boys.
You gonna be all right here?

16:57.009 --> 16:58.843
Of course. I'll be fine. Go.

17:08.688 --> 17:10.555
Sorry, Mike.

17:10.557 --> 17:12.189
This guy slipped off
for a private dance.

17:12.191 --> 17:14.791
You're not throwing me
out. I paid my money.

17:14.794 --> 17:16.527
You paid to look, not touch, asshole.

17:17.029 --> 17:19.564
That's it. I'm calling the cops.

17:19.566 --> 17:21.065
Let's see how you like
hanging out in MDC.

17:21.067 --> 17:23.968
No, no, no, no. You don't
need to call the cops.

17:23.970 --> 17:25.703
Who the hell are you?

17:25.704 --> 17:28.037
I'm the guy who's telling
you this one's had too much,

17:28.039 --> 17:30.306
and I'm here to get
him out of your hair.

17:30.308 --> 17:32.742
What about his buddies?

17:32.744 --> 17:34.711
They're not causing
any trouble, are they?

17:34.713 --> 17:37.313
Let them stay awhile longer.

17:37.315 --> 17:39.382
This one...

17:39.384 --> 17:42.151
this idiot goes home, sleeps it off.

17:42.153 --> 17:44.220
No, no. I'm not going. I paid...

17:44.222 --> 17:47.958
You... are done.

17:51.429 --> 17:53.563
Go on. Try me.

17:56.134 --> 17:58.134
Get him out of here.

18:05.275 --> 18:06.742
Sorry.

18:09.580 --> 18:12.781
The girl... is she okay?

18:12.783 --> 18:16.485
She's fine. Seen worse.

18:16.487 --> 18:18.754
This is for her trouble.

18:20.290 --> 18:22.791
All good?

18:22.793 --> 18:25.828
Yeah, man. We're cool.

18:34.438 --> 18:39.674
So... like this.

18:39.676 --> 18:42.977
How about...

18:44.814 --> 18:46.113
Nein. Nein, nein, nein, nein.

18:46.115 --> 18:48.516
Terry, support must be invisible.

18:48.518 --> 18:51.719
You can't throw a column
here, a column there.

18:51.721 --> 18:54.556
Maximum volume and open space inside.

18:54.558 --> 18:59.894
The final structure
has strict requirements.

18:59.896 --> 19:01.696
Load-bearing walls, then.

19:01.698 --> 19:03.464
Very good!

19:03.466 --> 19:05.166
Now you use your thinking
head, not your drinking head!

19:05.168 --> 19:07.368
But how do you get walls in place?

19:07.370 --> 19:10.303
There would be seven,
eight meters to a side.

19:10.305 --> 19:11.572
Pre-pour them off site.

19:11.574 --> 19:13.339
Slide the slabs in with the crane.

19:13.341 --> 19:14.908
Slide?

19:14.910 --> 19:17.510
Through the existing construction?

19:17.512 --> 19:19.512
You would knock down
the Chrysler Building

19:19.514 --> 19:21.815
just to add a subway stop, huh?

19:21.817 --> 19:23.050
No! The... Ah.

19:23.052 --> 19:25.652
Time to go, yeah?

19:25.654 --> 19:28.421
Mike, come sit with us.

19:28.423 --> 19:30.023
Your wife's calling.

19:30.025 --> 19:31.725
My wife?

19:31.727 --> 19:34.427
Yeah.

19:35.864 --> 19:40.734
Ah. Okay.

19:40.736 --> 19:45.171
Thank you very much,
gentlemen, for your hospitality.

19:45.173 --> 19:46.906
Good talking to you, Werner.

21:01.154 --> 21:02.454
Oh, no. I'm just gonna scrounge here.

21:45.298 --> 21:48.498
I'll lock up when I
go. Is that all right?

21:48.500 --> 21:50.200
Wife mad at you?

21:50.202 --> 21:51.302
She's not my wi...

21:53.539 --> 21:55.239
I don't know.

21:55.241 --> 21:56.307
Yeah.

21:56.309 --> 21:59.343
She's mad at you.

22:20.398 --> 22:21.664
Go on.

22:28.506 --> 22:30.940
You take her to dinner...

22:30.942 --> 22:34.444
nice place with a waiter, cloth napkin.

22:34.446 --> 22:36.846
You bring flowers.

22:36.848 --> 22:38.514
You say sorry.

22:38.516 --> 22:40.516
Then say sorry again.

22:40.518 --> 22:43.953
Whatever she says, you say sorry.

22:43.955 --> 22:47.823
I think we might be past that.

22:53.697 --> 22:55.597
I'll leave the bottle.

23:30.667 --> 23:32.366
Are you ready for me?
I'm a little early.

23:33.503 --> 23:34.869
No problem. Come on in.

23:36.673 --> 23:39.173
This is Gary Strote, Stef Carvaines,

23:39.175 --> 23:41.108
and Pat Malakovsky, my associates.

23:41.110 --> 23:44.111
- Hi.
- Suzanne Ericsen.

23:44.113 --> 23:45.647
- Hello.
- Good to meet you all.

23:45.649 --> 23:47.248
Nice to meet you.

23:52.806 --> 23:55.373
All right. You have a
response to our proffer?

23:55.375 --> 23:56.841
We do.

23:56.843 --> 23:58.943
Time served, three to
six months probation,

23:58.945 --> 24:00.611
we plead to simple battery.

24:00.613 --> 24:03.948
- A misdemeanor.
- Yes.

24:03.950 --> 24:07.851
You're asking to go from 18
months jail time down to nothing?

24:09.322 --> 24:11.488
Sorry. I can't do that.

24:11.490 --> 24:13.157
Okay.

24:14.660 --> 24:16.460
This is a motion for continuance.

24:16.462 --> 24:19.530
We're gonna need more time
to prepare our defense.

24:19.532 --> 24:22.199
The officer's report states
that he didn't canvass

24:22.201 --> 24:24.902
- for additional witnesses...
- There were none.

24:24.904 --> 24:26.304
And no one is contesting

24:26.306 --> 24:28.239
that Mr. Babineaux struck the officer.

24:28.241 --> 24:30.041
Be that as it may, there
are several businesses

24:30.043 --> 24:31.309
nearby with security cameras.

24:31.311 --> 24:32.791
We need time to subpoena all of them.

24:33.812 --> 24:35.378
Isn't that a bit much?

24:35.380 --> 24:37.414
We don't believe the
judge will see it that way.

24:37.416 --> 24:41.818
We'd simply like to have the most
complete information at our disposal.

24:41.820 --> 24:48.691
To that end, we're filing a
motion to compel discovery.

24:48.693 --> 24:52.329
You want to open Officer
Platt's personnel file.

24:52.331 --> 24:53.663
Good luck with that.

24:53.665 --> 24:55.698
It's a reasonable Brady disclosure.

24:55.700 --> 24:57.767
Officer Platt had a
history with Mr. Babineaux,

24:57.769 --> 25:00.003
and we'd like to know its extent.

25:00.005 --> 25:01.704
And if there's any larger
history Officer Platt has

25:01.706 --> 25:05.308
with friends, relatives, or
colleagues of Mr. Babineaux,

25:05.310 --> 25:07.609
we'd like to know that, too.

25:07.611 --> 25:10.245
You're thinking of
pursuing civil litigation.

25:10.247 --> 25:12.547
We are in conversation with the ACLU,

25:12.549 --> 25:14.850
assessing the possibility that
Mr. Babineaux's civil rights

25:14.852 --> 25:17.019
may have been violated.

25:20.091 --> 25:22.791
Okay. Is that all?

25:22.793 --> 25:25.060
For now.

25:26.630 --> 25:30.765
We will deal with all
of these issues in turn,

25:30.767 --> 25:33.302
and then we will set a trial date.

25:33.304 --> 25:36.271
I think that's all
we have to talk about.

25:37.574 --> 25:39.308
All right, then.

25:44.781 --> 25:46.882
Ms. Wexler, a word in private?

25:46.884 --> 25:48.984
I'll catch up.

25:56.426 --> 26:01.830
Kim, you're throwing three $400-an-hour
associates at a pro bono case?

26:01.832 --> 26:04.566
I never said this was pro bono.

26:07.738 --> 26:09.604
Okay, what's the plan here, Kim?

26:09.606 --> 26:11.907
Because shock and awe
isn't gonna cut it.

26:11.909 --> 26:14.942
Bring every fancy associate you got,

26:14.944 --> 26:16.844
file all the motions you want,

26:16.846 --> 26:20.781
and at the end of all this,
your client is still going away.

26:22.519 --> 26:24.218
Okay.

26:25.755 --> 26:27.755
I guess we'll see.

26:57.423 --> 26:59.657
Ah!

27:10.070 --> 27:13.337
Everyone seems much improved.

27:13.339 --> 27:16.774
This, uh, R and R was
a good idea, Michael.

27:22.415 --> 27:24.582
I... is something the matter?

27:31.524 --> 27:33.591
This?

27:34.927 --> 27:36.427
Don't be concerned.

27:36.429 --> 27:38.128
I said nothing.

27:38.130 --> 27:40.197
Men at a bar talking to make talk.

27:40.199 --> 27:43.500
And look... no details, no scale at all.

27:43.502 --> 27:48.939
Could be a skyscraper,
could be a box for shoes.

27:52.378 --> 27:54.445
I said nothing about the construction

27:54.447 --> 27:57.814
that would not be true
for thousands of others.

27:57.816 --> 28:00.217
By now, they have forgotten me entirely.

28:00.219 --> 28:06.489
They forgot the German national
in the middle of Albuquerque

28:06.491 --> 28:09.525
talking about pouring
hundreds of tons of concrete

28:09.527 --> 28:14.064
at a secret underground location?

28:14.066 --> 28:16.399
Yeah, you're right.

28:16.401 --> 28:20.070
I'm sorry, Michael. I had too much beer.

28:20.072 --> 28:23.473
And I may have said
more than I should have.

28:23.475 --> 28:27.878
Listen to me carefully.

28:29.581 --> 28:32.849
The man we're working
for is very serious.

28:32.851 --> 28:34.717
Think about the precautions we take

28:34.719 --> 28:37.520
to keep everything
that goes on here quiet.

28:37.522 --> 28:41.090
Think about how much
money you're making.

28:41.092 --> 28:44.594
Think about what happens
if something goes wrong.

28:44.596 --> 28:49.231
Do you understand what
I am saying to you?

28:53.705 --> 28:58.207
I do understand.

28:58.209 --> 29:00.710
And I'm sorry to cause any problem.

29:00.712 --> 29:03.279
You have my word...

29:03.281 --> 29:07.183
nothing like this will happen again.

29:17.260 --> 29:19.394
Okay.

29:20.597 --> 29:22.931
Let's get you to work.

29:29.973 --> 29:32.708
I have one question
for you, Ms. Ericsen.

29:32.710 --> 29:35.577
- Are you prosecuting Santa Claus?
- Your Honor?

29:35.579 --> 29:36.745
Because it looks like

29:36.747 --> 29:38.580
"Miracle on 34th Street" in here.

29:38.582 --> 29:39.881
This... this is just today,

29:39.883 --> 29:41.817
today's batch, huh?

29:41.819 --> 29:43.819
All addressed to me,

29:43.821 --> 29:45.987
all from some backwater in Louisiana.

29:45.989 --> 29:47.823
I... Look at... Uh,

29:47.825 --> 29:49.725
"Get your hands off our hero," they say.

29:49.727 --> 29:52.293
Uh, "Mercy for Huell
Babineaux," they say,

29:52.295 --> 29:54.829
what... like I'm sending
him to the electric chair.

29:54.831 --> 29:56.797
Come... Tell me, uh, Ms. Wexler,

29:56.799 --> 29:59.133
did you start this
particular ball rolling?

29:59.135 --> 30:01.502
Did I instruct the people
of Coushatta, Louisiana,

30:01.504 --> 30:03.137
to start writing letters to the court?

30:03.139 --> 30:06.407
No, Your Honor, I did not.

30:06.409 --> 30:09.110
That being said, it's
clear Mr. Babineaux

30:09.112 --> 30:13.147
has touched the lives of
many people in his hometown.

30:13.149 --> 30:15.583
And I do know they're planning
to send a contingent here

30:15.585 --> 30:17.352
to show their support during the trial.

30:17.354 --> 30:18.786
Are you talking about a bunch
of yahoos packing my court?

30:18.788 --> 30:20.588
I'm sorry, Your Honor,

30:20.590 --> 30:23.824
but I'm not sure what bearing
any of this has on the case.

30:23.826 --> 30:26.126
What does Mr. Babineaux's relationship

30:26.128 --> 30:29.096
to his hometown in...
Did you say Louisiana?

30:29.098 --> 30:31.131
Your Honor, this can't
be a complete surprise

30:31.133 --> 30:32.799
to the Assistant District Attorney.

30:32.801 --> 30:35.002
She knows the defendant's
history as well as I do.

30:35.004 --> 30:36.770
Lookit, if I receive one more letter

30:36.772 --> 30:38.538
from some swamp-dwelling do-gooder,

30:38.540 --> 30:40.607
- I'm gonna scream.
- Thank you for bringing

30:40.609 --> 30:42.776
this situation to our
attention, Your Honor.

30:42.778 --> 30:44.278
May I see one of these?

30:44.280 --> 30:46.213
Oh, oh, take as many as you want.

30:46.215 --> 30:49.049
Yeah, please, just take them all.

30:49.051 --> 30:52.786
I have looked at this case.
It does not merit a circus.

30:52.788 --> 30:54.487
Now, you two work it out!

30:54.489 --> 30:58.325
- We've tried, Your Honor.
- Try again.

31:01.897 --> 31:03.663
Pull the Babineaux file...

31:03.665 --> 31:05.364
every parking ticket,

31:05.366 --> 31:07.734
every time he is
mentioned in the records.

31:07.736 --> 31:09.836
You... call the arresting officer

31:09.838 --> 31:12.705
and find out what, if anything,
he left out of his reports.

31:12.707 --> 31:17.043
I want known associates,
places of residence,

31:17.045 --> 31:19.312
MVD records, all of it.

31:19.314 --> 31:22.181
We missed something,
and I want to know what.

31:22.183 --> 31:24.183
Right now! Go!

31:25.720 --> 31:27.186
Ben!

31:29.023 --> 31:30.556
Who we looking for?

31:30.558 --> 31:32.091
I want to figure out

31:32.093 --> 31:36.929
why a pickpocket has
people this overheated.

31:47.808 --> 31:50.142
"Huell Babineaux is wrongfully accused.

31:50.144 --> 31:51.910
He's a good man.

31:51.912 --> 31:54.280
He'd never do nothing like
the things you say he's done.

31:54.282 --> 31:56.548
He's a kind man and a
good friend to everyone."

31:56.550 --> 31:58.617
Jesus. They do make him
sound like Santa Claus.

31:58.619 --> 32:00.052
This one has a phone number.

32:00.054 --> 32:02.154
Let me see this.

32:13.266 --> 32:15.233
You've reached Elmer Fontaneau.

32:15.235 --> 32:17.102
I'm not here at the
moment, but leave a message,

32:17.104 --> 32:19.104
I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

32:19.106 --> 32:20.838
Have a blessed day.

32:20.840 --> 32:22.340
Hello, Mr. Fontaneau.

32:22.342 --> 32:24.175
My name is Suzanne Ericsen

32:24.177 --> 32:27.112
from the Albuquerque
District Attorney's office.

32:27.114 --> 32:29.780
Um, could you give me a
call when you have a moment?

32:29.782 --> 32:31.983
It's in regards to Huell Babineaux.

32:31.985 --> 32:39.124
My number is 505-186-1945. Thanks.

32:53.172 --> 32:54.204
Hello?

32:54.206 --> 32:56.807
Is this Eloise Luckard?

32:56.809 --> 32:59.043
- Speaking.
- Hi, Ms. Luckard.

32:59.045 --> 33:00.678
My name is Suzanne Ericsen.

33:00.680 --> 33:03.147
I'm an Assistant District Attorney

33:03.149 --> 33:05.315
in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

33:05.317 --> 33:07.885
You wrote a letter to Judge Munsinger

33:07.887 --> 33:09.453
about a Huell Babineaux.

33:09.455 --> 33:11.722
Oh, I love Huell.

33:11.724 --> 33:13.490
He's the dearest, dearest man.

33:13.492 --> 33:16.560
Um, do you mind my asking...

33:16.562 --> 33:18.695
how exactly do you know Huell?

33:18.697 --> 33:20.997
Oh, everyone in Coushatta knows Huell.

33:20.999 --> 33:22.699
He's a pillar of our church.

33:22.701 --> 33:24.333
And which church is that?

33:24.335 --> 33:27.537
Free Will Baptist,
right over on Bogan Lane.

33:27.539 --> 33:30.306
Um, I've seen several letters

33:30.308 --> 33:33.342
from fellow members
of your congregation.

33:33.344 --> 33:36.212
Could you explain to
me... is there some reason

33:36.214 --> 33:40.984
why Huell in particular holds
so much esteem in your church?

33:40.986 --> 33:43.853
- _
- I... I'm sorry.

33:43.855 --> 33:46.189
Who... who are you again?

33:46.191 --> 33:48.691
I'm... Um, I'm an
Assistant District Attorney

33:48.693 --> 33:50.560
from Albuquerque, New Mexico.

33:50.562 --> 33:53.162
I'm handling a case that
Mr. Babineaux's involved in.

33:53.164 --> 33:55.864
Handling how?

33:55.866 --> 33:59.902
Um... I'm prosecuting it.

33:59.904 --> 34:02.371
Y... you're the one
persecuting our Huell?

34:02.373 --> 34:04.840
H... how could you, to go after someone

34:04.842 --> 34:08.744
so sweet and kind with all those lies?

34:08.746 --> 34:12.681
Well, I'd tell you what
I really think of you,

34:12.683 --> 34:19.388
but Jesus is listening, so
I'll just say... shame on you!

34:19.389 --> 34:21.257
I...

34:21.259 --> 34:23.458
Okay.

34:24.561 --> 34:26.060
All right.

34:26.062 --> 34:28.130
Yeah, not too shabby.

34:28.132 --> 34:31.299
I've been taking improv classes.

34:46.181 --> 34:49.251
Oh, shit. Which one is it?

34:49.253 --> 34:51.886
- I... it's that one.
- Oh.

34:51.888 --> 34:56.790
It's the church. The church, the church.

34:56.792 --> 34:57.991
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.

35:05.268 --> 35:06.767
Hello dere!

35:06.769 --> 35:08.769
Free Will Baptist.
Pastor Hansford speaking.

35:08.771 --> 35:10.437
Uh, who this?

35:10.439 --> 35:12.973
Good afternoon, Pastor.
My name is Suzanne Ericsen.

35:12.975 --> 35:14.441
I'm an Assistant District Attorney

35:14.443 --> 35:16.243
from Albuquerque, New Mexico.

35:16.245 --> 35:18.945
Ooh, that's a long way off, Cher!

35:18.947 --> 35:21.114
Uh, can you hold on a second?

35:21.116 --> 35:22.683
Uh, Clarence is going at the organ.

35:22.685 --> 35:23.984
Just...

35:23.986 --> 35:27.954
I'm gonna step into the vestibule.

35:27.956 --> 35:29.656
Ah, there we go.

35:29.658 --> 35:32.425
Uh, now, uh, what can I do for you,

35:32.427 --> 35:34.527
Ms., uh... Ms. Ericsen, you say?

35:34.529 --> 35:35.862
Mm-hmm.

35:35.864 --> 35:38.198
Um, the court has received

35:38.200 --> 35:41.802
numerous letters from
members of your congregation

35:41.804 --> 35:45.038
in regards to Mr. Huell Babineaux.

35:45.040 --> 35:47.507
May I ask you a couple of
questions about Mr. Babineaux?

35:47.509 --> 35:49.209
Surely.

35:49.211 --> 35:51.311
Uh, what I can tell you about our Huell?

35:51.313 --> 35:55.515
Well, what kind of person
would you say Mr. Babineaux is?

35:55.517 --> 36:01.188
Why, I'd say he's a lovely
person both inside and out.

36:01.190 --> 36:03.155
Yes, I'm... I'm sure you'd say that

36:03.157 --> 36:04.724
about all your parishioners.

36:04.726 --> 36:06.992
Well, I suppose I would.

36:06.994 --> 36:10.029
But, no, no, Huell... Huell's special.

36:10.031 --> 36:13.399
He's got a heart as big
as Lake Pontchartrain.

36:13.401 --> 36:14.867
Mm.

36:14.869 --> 36:16.703
Um, do you mind my asking...

36:16.705 --> 36:21.974
what did he do to gain so
much devotion in Coushatta?

36:21.976 --> 36:27.213
Well, ma'am, for starters,
he is a bona fide hero.

36:27.215 --> 36:30.550
- He's a hero?
- Yes, ma'am.

36:30.552 --> 36:34.754
See, about a year ago, there
was a fire in the rectory,

36:34.756 --> 36:38.891
and it was during Bible
study, uh, at night

36:38.893 --> 36:41.927
'cause, uh, some of the
old folks around here,

36:41.929 --> 36:44.230
uh, they like to brush up on the Bible

36:44.232 --> 36:46.331
before, uh, they go to slep,

36:46.333 --> 36:49.835
you know, get right in
case the Lord call 'em home.

36:49.837 --> 36:51.370
Mm. Yes.

36:51.372 --> 36:52.905
And wouldn'tcha know it...

36:52.907 --> 36:55.340
there was a short circuit
in the old coffee maker.

36:55.342 --> 36:57.209
The whole thing catch fire,

36:57.211 --> 36:59.779
and the flame leaped
up to the windowsill.

36:59.781 --> 37:03.048
Well, Huell happened to
be visiting his people,

37:03.050 --> 37:04.616
and he saw the smoke.

37:04.618 --> 37:06.852
Well, what did he do?

37:06.854 --> 37:08.954
He burst right in.

37:08.956 --> 37:11.622
And he carried out every
last one of them oldsters.

37:11.624 --> 37:13.224
Mm, my goodness.

37:13.226 --> 37:15.794
And, um, what happened to the church?

37:15.796 --> 37:17.595
The church is fine.

37:20.433 --> 37:21.966
I shudder to think...

37:21.968 --> 37:24.803
... what might've happened
if God in His grace

37:24.805 --> 37:28.106
hadn't seen fit to send us old Huell.

37:28.108 --> 37:29.573
I see.

37:29.575 --> 37:32.076
Now, y'all sound like a real nice lady,

37:32.078 --> 37:34.279
and I know you're only doing your job,

37:34.281 --> 37:37.048
but I want you to understand something.

37:37.050 --> 37:39.450
I think you got the wrong
end of the stick here.

37:39.452 --> 37:41.585
Huell Babineaux is very important to us.

37:41.587 --> 37:43.120
Now, he...

37:43.122 --> 37:46.423
He... he would never
hurt a police officer.

37:46.425 --> 37:48.658
I believe it's just a misunderstanding.

37:48.660 --> 37:51.795
And I... I believe he might
have been helping his friend,

37:51.797 --> 37:54.932
and... and that's the Huell that I know.

37:54.934 --> 37:57.634
Well, well... Put that down, Clarence!

37:57.636 --> 38:00.237
Get rid of them robes,
now! That's for communion!

38:00.239 --> 38:03.173
Now... now, I will
be with you presently!

38:03.175 --> 38:06.009
Uh, ma'am, is there anything
else I can help you with?

38:06.011 --> 38:07.510
No. No, Pastor.

38:07.512 --> 38:09.779
Thank you for your time.
I... I think that's all.

38:09.781 --> 38:14.985
Oh, um, uh, have you set a
date yet for Huell's trial?

38:14.987 --> 38:16.686
Uh, no, not yet.

38:16.688 --> 38:19.088
Well, would you do me a kindness

38:19.090 --> 38:21.623
and, um, ring me up when you do?

38:21.625 --> 38:24.126
Because we got a
couple of charter buses.

38:24.128 --> 38:26.695
We're gonna bring the whole congregation

38:26.697 --> 38:30.266
up to y'all in Albuquerque.

38:30.268 --> 38:32.801
I'll make sure to let you know.

38:32.803 --> 38:34.603
Bless you.

38:34.605 --> 38:36.505
And I look forward Ta meetin' ya.

39:01.499 --> 39:02.598
Is it over?

39:08.071 --> 39:10.639
All right, here's what we're gonna do.

39:10.641 --> 39:13.509
I'm gonna take the church phone with me.

39:13.511 --> 39:14.976
She might call back.

39:14.978 --> 39:16.478
If any of these ring,

39:16.480 --> 39:21.750
I want you to pick up
every third caller, okay?

39:21.752 --> 39:23.985
30 seconds, max.

39:23.987 --> 39:26.353
Stick to the script.

39:26.355 --> 39:28.523
Let the rest go to voicemail.

39:28.525 --> 39:30.257
Uh...

39:30.259 --> 39:34.495
... so, are we just supposed
to hang around here till...

39:34.497 --> 39:35.730
You're paid for the day.

39:35.732 --> 39:37.331
You stay until I say you can go.

40:25.447 --> 40:28.081
Well?

40:41.555 --> 40:43.456
Do it one more time?

40:43.458 --> 40:44.991
Are you sure you can take it?

40:44.993 --> 40:46.559
I can if you can.

40:46.561 --> 40:48.895
All right. You asked for it.

40:49.997 --> 40:51.730
Hello dere!

40:51.732 --> 40:55.067
Look in your heart, Cher,
and find forgiveness.

40:55.069 --> 40:58.371
Let us take you on a
trip down N'awlins way,

40:58.373 --> 41:01.674
where they put a little
extra roux in da gumbo.

41:01.676 --> 41:02.808
Whoo!

41:02.810 --> 41:04.877
That's a beautiful red snapper.

41:04.879 --> 41:07.513
It's wondermous. I guarantee!

41:07.515 --> 41:09.848
Wow, it's just... it's
like I'm in the bayou.

41:09.850 --> 41:11.684
Yes, well, I got crawdads in my pants.

41:13.821 --> 41:15.521
That's... that's not a thing.

41:15.523 --> 41:17.356
- That's not a...
- It's a thing that happens to you

41:17.358 --> 41:20.226
when you're... sitting in the bayou.

41:23.665 --> 41:25.397
The phones were genius.

41:25.399 --> 41:28.066
- The phones.
- Yeah.

41:28.068 --> 41:31.603
Well, the phones were a touch.

41:31.605 --> 41:34.105
This was all you, start to finish.

41:34.107 --> 41:36.274
Bank shot off the judge.

41:36.276 --> 41:39.611
Four months probation, time served.

41:39.613 --> 41:43.248
It's like watching Roy Hobbs
smash out stadium lights.

41:43.250 --> 41:46.585
Oh, yeah, but the D.A.
overplayed her hand.

41:46.587 --> 41:48.420
- No.
- Yeah.

41:54.961 --> 41:57.729
- Got to go?
- Yeah.

42:00.933 --> 42:02.766
What are you up to today?

42:04.203 --> 42:07.638
I'm, uh, gonna check
out an office on Lomas,

42:07.640 --> 42:09.072
down by the courthouse.

42:09.074 --> 42:11.141
I thought you already found one.

42:11.143 --> 42:12.610
That one was, uh...

42:12.612 --> 42:14.578
It was a little more
office than I needed.

42:14.580 --> 42:16.647
Oh.

42:18.251 --> 42:21.252
You working late?

42:21.254 --> 42:23.186
Mm-hmm.

42:23.188 --> 42:24.622
Playing catch-up.

42:27.326 --> 42:29.360
All right.

42:29.362 --> 42:31.161
I better go.

42:31.163 --> 42:33.196
I got to go. I got to go. I need to go.

42:49.614 --> 42:51.514
The near-term window is set,

42:51.516 --> 42:53.215
but we have to hit every target

42:53.217 --> 42:54.850
to stick to that time table.

42:54.852 --> 42:57.387
As we look down the road,
we get more flexibility.

42:57.389 --> 42:58.721
When we get to rollouts

42:58.723 --> 43:00.690
in a 6-to-12-month timeline and beyond,

43:00.692 --> 43:02.325
we have some breathing room.

43:02.327 --> 43:04.460
It's an opportunity to retrench

43:04.462 --> 43:07.129
and meet our minimum
capital requirements.

43:07.131 --> 43:08.631
We should be stable as a table

43:08.633 --> 43:10.199
by the time we start on Wyoming.

43:10.201 --> 43:11.901
Sounds good.

43:11.903 --> 43:13.568
We should talk about Wyoming.

43:13.570 --> 43:15.404
Six months is gonna go by fast.

43:18.642 --> 43:21.010
Unless...

43:21.012 --> 43:23.712
- Kevin, did you have something?
- Oh, no, I'm sorry.

43:23.714 --> 43:25.214
I don't want to slow us down.

43:25.216 --> 43:28.684
And Paige will hate me
for bringing this up.

43:31.602 --> 43:33.302
What's on your mind?

43:33.304 --> 43:35.670
Well, the foot traffic at
Tucumcari is off the charts,

43:35.672 --> 43:37.773
and that's driving a
lot of new accounts.

43:37.775 --> 43:41.110
Seems to me it's because the
building itself is damn eye-catching.

43:41.112 --> 43:42.477
Now, I want to hit on

43:42.479 --> 43:44.479
all the milestones we're talking about.

43:44.481 --> 43:49.751
And Paige tells me what I'm gonna
ask is impossible, but, uh...

43:49.753 --> 43:53.354
what if we made the Lubbock
branch the same as Tucumcari?

43:53.356 --> 43:55.023
I reminded Kevin that Tucumcari

43:55.025 --> 43:57.258
has a much larger footprint
than the current Lubbock design,

43:57.260 --> 43:58.993
and that design is the one

43:58.995 --> 44:00.796
- we've been hanging our estimates on.
- I know. I know.

44:00.798 --> 44:04.533
We're down the road a
ways on this, but, uh...

44:04.535 --> 44:06.167
what do you think, Kim?

44:06.169 --> 44:11.773
Can you pull another rabbit
out of the hat for us?

44:12.876 --> 44:16.445
Kevin, I'm sorry.

44:16.447 --> 44:18.480
But I have to agree with Paige.

44:18.482 --> 44:20.482
It took almost two months

44:20.484 --> 44:23.317
to get local approval
for the current design,

44:23.319 --> 44:25.018
so starting over now?

44:25.020 --> 44:28.556
There's simply no way we
could stick to our timetable.

44:28.558 --> 44:33.360
I hate to say it, but...
it is. It's unfeasible.

44:33.362 --> 44:35.295
Okay.

44:35.297 --> 44:38.365
I get it. I had to ask.

44:38.367 --> 44:39.399
Paige, you were right.

44:39.401 --> 44:40.734
This time.

44:40.736 --> 44:44.004
All right. Wyoming, then.

44:44.006 --> 44:45.906
Yellowstone, here we come.

44:45.908 --> 44:47.808
Great.

44:47.810 --> 44:49.810
So, looking to Wyoming,

44:49.812 --> 44:52.980
we are moving forward with
market research as planned.

45:24.513 --> 45:27.514
Space is closing in on
rough final dimensions.

45:27.516 --> 45:29.682
Most of the spoil's out and dispersed.

45:29.684 --> 45:32.184
The tunnel is holding, and it's clear.

45:32.186 --> 45:33.585
And the front loader...

45:33.587 --> 45:35.921
... hit this support stanchion.

45:35.923 --> 45:38.590
The guys had it back up in an hour.

45:38.592 --> 45:40.726
No permanent damage.

45:40.728 --> 45:45.464
And the form they used
to pour cement into...

45:45.466 --> 45:46.698
it's totaled.

45:46.700 --> 45:48.700
We're gonna have to make a new one

45:48.702 --> 45:50.969
before we can get back to the wall.

45:50.971 --> 45:54.907
So we're looking at four,
maybe five days for that.

45:54.909 --> 45:58.110
Coulda been worse.

45:58.112 --> 46:02.915
The rock... that is more of an issue.

46:02.917 --> 46:06.284
It is smack dab in the
middle of our elevator shaft.

46:06.286 --> 46:08.719
Can't work around it, can't dig it out.

46:08.721 --> 46:10.321
So we're back to blasting.

46:11.791 --> 46:15.960
Setup, clearing away debris

46:15.962 --> 46:17.962
adds maybe another week.

46:17.964 --> 46:19.330
The best estimate...

46:19.332 --> 46:21.266
we're a little past the halfway point.

46:21.268 --> 46:23.234
Way behind schedule.

46:23.236 --> 46:25.103
But the work is solid.

46:28.641 --> 46:30.475
And Werner?

46:32.579 --> 46:35.180
I gave him the "come to Jesus."

46:35.182 --> 46:36.514
He screwed up.

46:36.516 --> 46:39.484
He knows it, said it won't happen again.

46:41.521 --> 46:43.887
And what do you say?

46:45.424 --> 46:47.424
I've got eyes on him.

46:47.426 --> 46:49.460
But, yeah, he's good.

46:56.001 --> 46:58.602
Good.

47:07.279 --> 47:09.546
Is that water?

47:09.548 --> 47:12.048
The landlord will kick in
for small repairs like that.

47:12.050 --> 47:14.784
They already took care
of the rodent problem.

47:14.786 --> 47:16.720
Rodent problem?

47:16.722 --> 47:18.454
You asked for small and near court.

47:18.456 --> 47:19.955
This is both.

47:19.957 --> 47:22.125
And it's in your price range.

47:22.127 --> 47:23.626
Use your imagination.

47:24.629 --> 47:26.562
Think creatively.

47:28.199 --> 47:30.399
Uh, excuse me for a sec, would you?

47:30.401 --> 47:31.601
Yeah. Take your time.

47:37.175 --> 47:39.074
Hey.

47:39.076 --> 47:40.176
Hey.

47:40.178 --> 47:42.311
Is this your new office?

47:42.313 --> 47:44.813
Uh, it's a contender.

47:45.715 --> 47:48.584
What are you doin' here?

47:49.186 --> 47:53.221
I was driving, saw your
Esteem in the parking lot.

47:59.163 --> 48:01.663
So, what's up?

48:01.665 --> 48:03.999
Nothing.

48:05.502 --> 48:08.871
Just drivin' around,
thinking about things.

48:13.110 --> 48:17.379
Listen, Kim, I... I
know what's on your mind.

48:17.381 --> 48:21.316
The thing that we did...
I mean, it was nuts.

48:23.154 --> 48:25.987
And I dumped it in your lap.

48:25.989 --> 48:30.792
Ex parte communication,
contempt of court.

48:30.794 --> 48:32.226
I mean, what, we're talking about

48:32.228 --> 48:33.861
a couple hundred counts of mail fraud?

48:33.863 --> 48:35.897
I could have wrecked
you with Schweikart.

48:35.899 --> 48:37.299
Could bone me, too.

48:37.301 --> 48:40.001
I mean, I'm this close
to being reinstated.

48:40.003 --> 48:41.503
I mean, come on.

48:44.308 --> 48:48.242
Kim...

48:48.244 --> 48:49.744
don't worry.

48:49.746 --> 48:51.078
No one's gonna know about it.

48:51.080 --> 48:52.847
Be like it never happened.

48:52.849 --> 48:54.749
And also I agree...

48:54.751 --> 48:58.353
we are totally done with all that,

48:58.355 --> 49:01.722
over and out, no more.

49:11.200 --> 49:13.867
Let's do it again.
