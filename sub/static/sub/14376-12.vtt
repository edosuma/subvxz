Hello, Dexter!

01:09.250 --> 01:10.433
Hello,
Mrs. Wolfberg.

Hello.

01:18.266 --> 01:21.033
Man: Well, class.
Welcome to the new year.

01:21.066 --> 01:23.400
So let's get
right into it. Uh, yes?

01:23.433 --> 01:25.166
The answer
is hydrogen.

01:25.200 --> 01:27.300
Why, yes, that is
the correct answer

01:27.333 --> 01:29.216
to the question
I was about to ask.

01:29.250 --> 01:33.150
Oh, I almost forgot.
I wanted to introduce
our new student.

01:33.183 --> 01:35.283
Will you come up here,
please, son?

01:35.316 --> 01:39.450
Class, say hello
to Mr. Astronomanov.

01:39.483 --> 01:44.100
Please, sir,
call me mandark!

01:46.183 --> 01:49.116
Excuse me, sir,
but may I please
relocate myself

01:49.150 --> 01:51.050
to a closer location
to the board

01:51.083 --> 01:54.400
so I can achieve
the optimum effect
of your education?

01:54.433 --> 01:56.333
Go ahead, mandark.

01:56.366 --> 02:00.100
This location will be
quite adequate.

02:01.150 --> 02:04.216
Yes, Dexter,
i<i>can</i>

02:04.250 --> 02:07.183
and I<i>am</i>
than you.

02:07.216 --> 02:08.333
This is your principal.

02:08.366 --> 02:11.216
Welcome to
the new year, students.

02:11.250 --> 02:12.300
Let the studies begin!

02:12.333 --> 02:16.316
Write an essay
on what you did
this summer vacation.

02:16.350 --> 02:18.133

02:18.166 --> 02:19.083
Done.

02:19.116 --> 02:21.266

the bill of rights?

02:21.300 --> 02:22.183
Thomas Jefferson.

02:22.216 --> 02:24.183
What is the name
of Neptune's moon?

02:24.216 --> 02:25.050
Triton.

02:25.083 --> 02:26.400
What kind
of triangle has--

02:26.433 --> 02:30.116
isosceles, gastrozooid,
the medulla oblongata.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.450
That's incredible!

02:31.483 --> 02:35.083
No!

02:35.433 --> 02:38.250
I am sorry, my mentor!

02:38.283 --> 02:40.416

Hey, Dexter.

02:46.100 --> 02:49.150
Some kid told me
you have a laboratory.

02:49.183 --> 02:50.300
A laboratory?

02:50.333 --> 02:53.350
Dexter, your lab--
it is the one thing
he does not have,

02:53.383 --> 02:57.316
and it will still
make you the smartest
one of all.

02:57.350 --> 03:01.050
Go ahead.
Show him your lab.

03:01.466 --> 03:03.316
Welcome!
And be amazed

03:03.350 --> 03:08.000
at the world
of Dexter's
laboratory!

[Yawn]

03:09.066 --> 03:10.333
Very cute, Dexter.
Very cute.

03:10.366 --> 03:15.200
Now let me show you
a real scientific
facility.

03:16.450 --> 03:19.450
Welcome to
my laboratory!

03:19.483 --> 03:21.050
Laboratory!

03:21.083 --> 03:22.166
Laboratory!

03:22.200 --> 03:24.350
As you can plainly
see, Dexter,

03:24.383 --> 03:26.016
this facility
accommodates

03:26.050 --> 03:29.283
every aspect of science
known to man.

03:29.316 --> 03:30.300
Thank you.

03:30.333 --> 03:32.400
So for you to continue
to waste precious energy

03:32.433 --> 03:35.233
with your little lab
would be scientifically unsound,

03:35.266 --> 03:37.316
and so I leave you
with 2 choices--

03:37.350 --> 03:40.450
either you become my lackey
or shut down your lab

03:40.483 --> 03:43.483
and discontinue any further
experiments here on in.

03:44.016 --> 03:45.383
The choice is yours.

03:45.416 --> 03:48.450
Good-bye, Dexter!

doing, Dexter?

04:02.133 --> 04:06.233
[Voice slowing down]
Good-bye, Dexter.

04:06.266 --> 04:10.033
No!

04:12.300 --> 04:16.150

a complete shutdown
from Dexter's lab.

name the eternals
have blessed her with.

Set me up on a date with
that golden-haired angel

05:43.316 --> 05:46.216
who graces our
undeserving school with
her infinite beauty!

05:46.250 --> 05:49.233
No way. You don't
owe that jerk
any favors.

05:49.266 --> 05:52.250
That's right.
He made you
shut down your lab.

05:52.283 --> 05:53.300
He's right.

05:53.333 --> 05:54.283
Yeah!

05:54.316 --> 05:56.266
And besides,
Dee Dee's hyper and clumsy,

05:56.300 --> 06:00.350

mandark's labora---

to get it out!

of yourself, man.

using my X-ray vision.

with your purple hide
intact.

disgusting, krunk!

and annoy you

09:47.116 --> 09:48.166
and then flit about

09:48.200 --> 09:52.133
and then spread icky pollen
and make gooey honey

09:52.166 --> 09:53.133
and sting you!

10:29.466 --> 10:33.250
I think we should
try something else.

10:33.416 --> 10:35.000
Major glory: Pay attention.

10:35.033 --> 10:38.266
It is a known fact that
bees love the outdoors.

10:38.300 --> 10:40.450
Ergo, we open
all the windows.

10:40.483 --> 10:44.400
The bee will fly right out.
Any questions?

10:44.433 --> 10:45.466
Krunk go potty?

10:46.000 --> 10:49.033
You are
a justice friend, mister.
You'll hold it!

10:49.066 --> 10:51.416
To the windows!

10:53.366 --> 10:55.250
Well-done,
val halland.

10:55.283 --> 10:57.333
Window stuck.

10:57.366 --> 11:01.100
We really must work
on his self-control.

11:01.133 --> 11:02.283
Great stars!

11:02.316 --> 11:05.050
What's wrong? He's just
going to fly right out
the window, right?

11:05.083 --> 11:06.416
Major glory:
I'm such a fool!

11:06.450 --> 11:08.416
Why? Because
of your costume?

11:08.450 --> 11:10.233
No. Don't you see?

11:10.266 --> 11:14.100
If the windows are open,
that means more of the devils
could just swoop right in.

11:14.133 --> 11:15.283
We could be overrun!

11:15.316 --> 11:17.066
But if the windows
are shut,

11:17.100 --> 11:20.183
how do we
get rid of the bee
that's already here?

11:20.216 --> 11:24.016
From sea to shining sea!
I see your point, man.

11:24.050 --> 11:27.016
The answer lies
within the window itself.

11:27.050 --> 11:29.050
By raising it
even just so much,

11:29.083 --> 11:34.116
I create a doorway--
a doorway through which
more evil may enter,

11:34.150 --> 11:35.383
and yet,
by sealing the portal,

11:35.416 --> 11:40.366
I leave myself at bay
for the terror which has
already shown itself.

11:40.400 --> 11:45.000
Am I not a champion?
Can I not find a solution?

11:45.033 --> 11:48.016
Hmm. Maybe if I
put in a screen, eh?

11:48.050 --> 11:49.300
We've lost
glory boy, krunk.

11:49.333 --> 11:52.050
Looks like it's
up to you and me.

11:52.083 --> 11:56.016
Yo, bee, heed the power
of my ax!

11:57.183 --> 11:59.250
Whoa!

12:01.233 --> 12:03.083
Killer moves, bee!

12:03.116 --> 12:05.483
Ah! Major glory,
do you solemnly
declare

12:06.016 --> 12:10.166
that this window
shall be and forever
shall remain...

12:10.200 --> 12:12.116
Closed?

12:14.050 --> 12:15.250
Washington's wig!

12:15.283 --> 12:20.450
Has anyone ever
come so close to death
only to emerge unscathed?

12:21.183 --> 12:25.316
Val halland, speak to me!
Speak to me, boy!

12:25.350 --> 12:26.283
No! No!

12:26.316 --> 12:30.100
The life of a comrade
has been taken!

12:30.133 --> 12:32.383
Uh, actually,
I think I'm ok.

12:32.416 --> 12:34.450
I shall avenge you!

12:39.350 --> 12:41.433
Aah! Fire!

12:41.466 --> 12:44.033
Stop, drop, roll!
Stop, drop, roll!

12:44.066 --> 12:46.250
Stop, drop, roll!
Stop, drop, roll!

funny dance.

12:48.483 --> 12:51.116
Oh, krunk,
look at my uniform.

12:51.150 --> 12:54.350
It's ruined--charred
beyond recognition.

12:54.383 --> 12:58.033
Individually,
the bee has
defeated each of us.

12:58.066 --> 13:00.083
However,
by banding together,

13:00.116 --> 13:05.016
we shall form
the one force which
is unbeatable--

13:05.050 --> 13:06.466
the justice frenzy!

13:07.000 --> 13:10.333
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!
Justice frenzy!
Justice frenzy!

13:10.366 --> 13:13.200
Val halland...

13:13.233 --> 13:15.433
Infragable krunk!

13:17.166 --> 13:19.100
Justice friends...

13:19.133 --> 13:22.366
Let's frenzy!

13:26.283 --> 13:28.100
Whoa!

13:28.133 --> 13:31.183
Hey!

13:35.183 --> 13:37.116
Hang in there,
justice friends.

13:37.150 --> 13:41.033
I think we've
just about got him!

13:41.066 --> 13:44.366
No! Waaa!

13:48.166 --> 13:50.016
This--this is
unheard of.

13:50.050 --> 13:53.100
No villain has ever defeated
the justice frenzy!

13:53.133 --> 13:56.016
There's only one thing
left to do!

13:56.050 --> 13:58.333
Well, we certainly
showed that bee,

better steps
on a ladder.

any dances, Dexter!

a lifetime has passed

15:34.366 --> 15:38.166
since you sent your deadly agent
to destroy my lab, Dexter.

15:38.200 --> 15:40.166
Yet i--mandark--
still cannot sleep.

15:40.200 --> 15:42.233
You keep haunting me
and haunting me,

15:42.266 --> 15:46.416
but I'll get you, Dexter.
I swear, I'll get you.

15:47.133 --> 15:51.400
First and foremost,
class, I want to announce
the science fair coming up.

15:51.433 --> 15:53.316
You all better
get cooking on a project

15:53.350 --> 15:58.200

I shouldn't just give
first prize to Dexter.

15:58.233 --> 16:01.000
Am I right? Hee hee!

16:01.466 --> 16:06.150
Thank you, Mr. Phillips.
You are all too kind.

Winning these 3 years
has not been an easy task.

16:14.383 --> 16:16.000
What can I say?

16:16.033 --> 16:22.283
My only hope is to forge ahead
and break new ground in
science.

That's enough! Look at all of
you and your foolish
worshiping.

16:32.033 --> 16:35.183
And you, Mr. Phillips--
you should hold your tongue!
