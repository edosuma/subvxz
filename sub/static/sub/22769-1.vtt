00:07.460 --> 00:08.500
Okay, Hiro,

00:08.500 --> 00:09.880
I'm going to let you go now.
You ready?

00:09.880 --> 00:11.080
No, no, no,
Tadashi, wait!

00:11.080 --> 00:12.170
Don't be scared,
little brother.

00:12.170 --> 00:13.830
Just pedal harder!
You can do it!

00:13.830 --> 00:15.620
Aunt Cass:
Yeah! Woo-hoo!
Go, Hiro!

00:15.620 --> 00:17.250
-Yeah, yeah! You got it!
-(beeps)

00:19.250 --> 00:22.080
Well, Tadashi, this is it,

00:22.080 --> 00:24.040
first day of nerd school.

00:24.040 --> 00:25.790
All because of you.

00:28.880 --> 00:31.000
-(zips zipper)
-Ow!

00:43.460 --> 00:44.830
Reporter:
Reports are still flooding in

00:44.830 --> 00:47.040
about a group of unidentified
individuals

00:47.040 --> 00:48.750
who prevented what
could have been

00:48.750 --> 00:50.210
a major catastrophe.

00:50.210 --> 00:52.670
The whole city
of San Fransokyo is asking:

00:54.920 --> 00:56.750
Having
victory pancakes.

00:56.750 --> 00:58.960
-Hiro!
-Hey! Come on,
let's not be late.

00:58.960 --> 01:01.830
Hey, Sweetie.
I made you a lunch.

01:01.830 --> 01:04.000
Uh, do you pack lunch
to college?

01:04.000 --> 01:06.330
I don't-- I don't know.
Is that not cool?

01:06.330 --> 01:07.960
Oh, I'm so proud!

01:07.960 --> 01:10.210
-I just wanna squeeze you!
-Aunt Cass! I--

01:10.210 --> 01:12.880
-(sighs with relief)
-Okay, you guys better go.

01:15.790 --> 01:17.170
Hiro:
Last hug.

01:17.170 --> 01:20.290
Tadashi would be
so proud of you.

01:24.750 --> 01:26.790
-Are you nervous, Hiro?
-No way!

01:26.790 --> 01:29.000
I want this.
Why would I be nervous.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.920
You're 14 and going to college.

01:30.920 --> 01:32.830
Your brother is, like,
a legend here.

01:32.830 --> 01:36.330
Also, I hear the new dean
is a hard case.

01:36.330 --> 01:39.540
I... hadn't thought
of any of those things.

01:39.540 --> 01:41.750
Well, keep not
thinking of them.

01:41.750 --> 01:44.790
(camera shutter clicking)

01:45.880 --> 01:47.500
Ugh!

01:49.540 --> 01:51.790
-That's unfortunate.
-I'll take that.

01:52.920 --> 01:55.960
Don't ever lose this.

01:55.960 --> 01:58.000
Seriously, it's like $20
to replace.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.460
Okay, you're official.

01:59.460 --> 02:00.920
-Tour time!
-Ahhh!

02:00.920 --> 02:04.210
This is the room where people
wear goggles and do stuff.

02:04.210 --> 02:06.040
Hiro:
Virtual reality!

02:06.040 --> 02:07.330
Oh, nice!

02:07.330 --> 02:08.880
Yeah... that.

02:08.880 --> 02:10.920
And this is the quad.

02:10.920 --> 02:13.790
Named after someone
with the last name "Quad,"
one would presume.

02:13.790 --> 02:14.960
(gasps)

02:14.960 --> 02:16.750
(beeping)

02:21.080 --> 02:23.580
And this, of course,
is the fooding zone,

02:23.580 --> 02:26.580
as a non-student,
my favorite place on campus.

02:26.580 --> 02:28.460
Whoa!

02:28.460 --> 02:30.250
(bots beeping)

02:31.620 --> 02:33.670
-Wow.
-Cool, huh?

02:33.670 --> 02:36.920
I-I didn't realize
this place was so, uh, huge.

02:36.920 --> 02:39.080
Awesome, but huge.

02:39.080 --> 02:40.540
Don't be intimidated.

02:40.540 --> 02:42.000
Just take it
one class at a time.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.330
Ugh. Applied Particle
Physics first.

02:44.330 --> 02:46.540
(gasps)
Me, too! Yay!

02:46.540 --> 02:48.670
What's your first class, Hiro?

02:53.670 --> 02:55.000
You okay?

02:55.000 --> 02:57.080
We miss Tadashi, too.

02:57.080 --> 02:58.380
And Baymax.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.290
Yeah, I'll, um,

03:02.290 --> 03:04.830
I'll catch up
with you guys later.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.040
Wish you were here,
big brother.

03:34.040 --> 03:36.040
Ba-la-la-la-la.

03:39.620 --> 03:41.710
Tadashi's chip.

03:41.710 --> 03:42.960
Baymax!

03:45.880 --> 03:48.250
Um... okay, okay.
I'm gonna need...

03:48.250 --> 03:50.580
carbon fiber skeleton,
actuators...

03:50.580 --> 03:52.120
Definitely gonna upgrade
to super capacitors.

03:52.120 --> 03:55.170
Ha! I can do this!
I can rebuild you, Baymax.

03:55.170 --> 03:57.580
Good morning.
I'm Professor Granville,

03:57.580 --> 03:59.750
your new
Dean of Students.

03:59.750 --> 04:03.210
Welcome to San Fransokyo
Institute of Technology.

04:03.210 --> 04:05.830
I trust that we are going
to have an excellent year...

04:05.830 --> 04:07.330
(volume lowers)

04:07.330 --> 04:10.000
Which means hard work!

04:10.000 --> 04:11.920
Some of us are trying
to work.

04:11.920 --> 04:13.170
-Mr. Hamada!
-Huh?

04:13.170 --> 04:14.420
Turn around.

04:14.420 --> 04:15.710
Yah!

04:15.710 --> 04:18.960
Private labs are not
for first semester freshmen.

04:18.960 --> 04:20.670
Oh... uh...

04:20.670 --> 04:22.880
this is my brother's lab.

04:22.880 --> 04:24.620
Or... was.

04:24.620 --> 04:26.380
Tadashi was a gifted
young man.

04:26.380 --> 04:28.500
He worked hard
to earn this lab,

04:28.500 --> 04:31.170
as I'm sure
you will someday,

04:31.170 --> 04:32.790
when you're ready.

04:32.790 --> 04:33.880
I'm ready now!

04:33.880 --> 04:35.920
Look, I'm rebuilding
Bayma--

04:35.920 --> 04:37.960
My brother's healthcare
companion project.

04:37.960 --> 04:39.290
Mr. Hamada,

04:39.290 --> 04:40.920
if you want to live up
to your brother's legacy,

04:40.920 --> 04:43.540
you should start by getting
to your classes on time.

04:43.540 --> 04:45.500
I could not agree more!

04:45.500 --> 04:47.000
Punctuality
is very important.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.170
-It was so nice to--
-Ticktock, Mr. Hamada.

04:50.170 --> 04:53.210
Don't want to keep your
Thermodynamics professor
waiting.

04:53.210 --> 04:55.540
I hear she's tough, but fair--

04:55.540 --> 04:57.120
intermittently.

05:01.120 --> 05:04.540
Ah, Teen Genius
has decided to join us.

05:04.540 --> 05:06.670
-How did you--
-Short. Cut.

05:06.670 --> 05:09.000
I can take them.
You cannot.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.960
Let's begin!

05:10.960 --> 05:12.710
(grumbles)

05:14.290 --> 05:15.790
Oh, I didn't realize

05:15.790 --> 05:17.710
we were still doing
the whole superhero thing.

05:17.710 --> 05:20.210
Uh, yeah!
Wait, where's Hiro?

05:20.210 --> 05:22.040
Said he had something
he needed to do after school.

05:22.040 --> 05:23.710
But he's gonna miss
our first night patrol!

05:23.710 --> 05:25.120
Night patrol?

05:25.120 --> 05:27.620
Where we suit up
and patrol the streets,

05:27.620 --> 05:29.500
thwart evildoers,
dispense justice,

05:29.500 --> 05:31.210
etcetera, awesome, etcetera!

05:31.210 --> 05:33.170
-Yeah, I'm not gonna do that.
-I-I don't think so.

05:33.170 --> 05:35.040
Why not? You guys have
clearly forgotten

05:35.040 --> 05:37.120
how sweet it was
being superheros.

05:37.120 --> 05:39.120
We caught
a revenge-crazed villain,

05:39.120 --> 05:40.670
we saved the city,

05:40.670 --> 05:42.170
we had victory pancakes!

05:42.170 --> 05:44.830
And you have clearly forgotten
that we are not superheros.

05:44.830 --> 05:46.830
Also, it was really scary!

05:46.830 --> 05:49.170
-You didn't seem scared.
-Because I was pumped
full of adrenaline.

05:49.170 --> 05:51.000
Now I'm back to being
afraid of things.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.120
Heights, speed,
cholesterol, loud noises!

05:53.120 --> 05:54.790
I've got issues.

05:54.790 --> 05:56.420
You do not want
to be Wasabi.

05:56.420 --> 05:58.960
Sorry, Freddie.
We already lost Baymax

05:58.960 --> 06:01.540
and we almost lost Hiro.
I don't want to lose
anyone else.

06:01.540 --> 06:04.170
But there could be
a super-villain out there
right now about to--

06:04.170 --> 06:07.040
Face it, Fred, we aren't
in one of your comic books.

06:07.040 --> 06:09.000
This is the real world,
and in the real world,

06:09.000 --> 06:11.170
there are
no super-villains.

06:11.170 --> 06:13.080
(screams)

06:13.080 --> 06:15.120
I'll ask one more time:

06:15.120 --> 06:17.620
-Where's my money?
-(whimpers) I lost it.

06:17.620 --> 06:20.250
Yama, it's him.

06:20.250 --> 06:22.290
Go ahead
and take the call.

06:25.750 --> 06:27.330
Obake. Mm.

06:27.330 --> 06:29.120
Whatever you need.
What is it?

06:29.120 --> 06:30.670
(laughter, static)

06:30.670 --> 06:32.750
(beeping)

06:32.750 --> 06:35.120
-And where is it?
-(static crackles)

06:35.120 --> 06:36.710
Done!

06:43.210 --> 06:44.330
Please work, please work.

06:45.620 --> 06:48.170
-Hello, Hiro.
-Baymax!

06:49.460 --> 06:52.290
Yeah, the hug's not really--

06:52.290 --> 06:54.250
We'll have to stick with this
for now, buddy.

06:54.250 --> 06:55.540
Ba-la-la-la-la.

06:55.540 --> 06:58.290
Without my body,
I am not able to feel.

06:58.290 --> 06:59.330
I know.

06:59.330 --> 07:01.710
Because I do not have
tactile receptors.

07:01.710 --> 07:04.540
Oh, right. Don't worry,
I'm working on it.

07:04.540 --> 07:06.880

07:19.580 --> 07:21.000
Ah!

07:29.080 --> 07:31.250
Baymax:
My endoskeleton
is complete.

07:31.250 --> 07:32.170
Finally.

07:32.170 --> 07:34.420
You can now move on
to the test phase.

07:34.420 --> 07:36.670
Tests phase? Ha!
Are you kidding?

07:36.670 --> 07:38.380
I just have to get you
dressed, and boom!

07:38.380 --> 07:41.920
The diagnostics protocol
will take seven to 10 days.

07:41.920 --> 07:43.380
Seven to 10 days?!

07:43.380 --> 07:47.380
Tadashi always ran
an extensive diagnostics
protocol.

07:47.380 --> 07:49.790
Yeah, that sounds
like Tadashi.

07:49.790 --> 07:51.540
Here we go.

07:51.540 --> 07:52.620
Yes!

07:52.620 --> 07:54.170
See, Baymax,

07:54.170 --> 07:55.920
it's perfect.

07:55.920 --> 07:58.210
(mechanical whirring)

07:58.210 --> 08:00.170
Huh?
(gasps)

08:05.250 --> 08:06.620
No!

No, no, no!
Come on!

08:11.380 --> 08:13.420
No, no!
Watch out!

08:15.460 --> 08:17.210
Oh, no.

08:17.210 --> 08:19.170
My body is running away.

08:23.080 --> 08:24.290
Huh?

08:24.290 --> 08:26.330
(electrical crackling)

08:30.120 --> 08:33.210
Mr. Hamada,
what are you doing here
at this hour?

08:33.210 --> 08:35.330
I was... studying.

08:35.330 --> 08:38.330
Yeah, just came out
for some... fresh air.

08:38.330 --> 08:40.830
Woo! That's fresh.
Well, better go.

08:40.830 --> 08:43.250
-Follow me.
-Actually, I...

08:44.830 --> 08:46.250
have nowhere else
I need to be,

08:46.250 --> 08:48.380
so, I will follow you.

08:51.620 --> 08:53.170
When we first met,

08:53.170 --> 08:56.080
I was worried
you would become distracted
by your own agenda.

08:56.080 --> 08:58.290
-Or worse.
-Uh-huh.

08:58.290 --> 09:00.120
You know about
the bot fighting.

09:00.120 --> 09:02.620
But I have to admit,
you've shown discipline.

09:02.620 --> 09:05.080
You're doing exceptionally
well in your classes.

09:05.080 --> 09:06.580
You should be
very proud.

09:06.580 --> 09:08.040
No, stop!

09:08.040 --> 09:10.580
No... stop...
giving me compliments.

09:10.580 --> 09:13.040
(laughs)
I don't want
to get a big head.

09:13.040 --> 09:15.290
Then I'll just say this.
Keep up the good work.

09:15.290 --> 09:17.250
I-I will. Thanks.

09:17.250 --> 09:18.960
So... tired.

09:18.960 --> 09:20.380
Better get home.

09:20.380 --> 09:23.000
Uh... bye.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.170
Whew.

09:25.170 --> 09:27.500
After unrelenting badgering,
the team...

09:27.500 --> 09:29.460
-Caved.
-...came together.

09:29.460 --> 09:31.330
Now unified, they embark
on their first night patrol,

09:31.330 --> 09:33.830
knowing they are the city's
last bastion of hope.

09:33.830 --> 09:35.880
Could you please stop
narrating, Fred?

09:35.880 --> 09:37.750
Yeah, nothing's happening,
Freddie.

09:37.750 --> 09:39.580
I think it might be time
to go home.

09:39.580 --> 09:40.620
(tires squealing)

09:42.540 --> 09:43.710
Did you see that?

09:43.710 --> 09:46.170
That, my friends,
is obviously a car thief.

09:46.170 --> 09:48.290
It's last bastion time!

09:50.460 --> 09:51.880
Halt!

09:51.880 --> 09:53.670
Yeah, he's not halting.

09:53.670 --> 09:55.710
No, he's not!

09:55.710 --> 09:57.040
Ah!

09:57.040 --> 09:59.380
Ahh! He didn't stop!

09:59.380 --> 10:01.290
Fred:
And we got a chase scene!

10:01.290 --> 10:02.420
(screaming)

10:02.420 --> 10:04.290
Pull over, now!

10:04.290 --> 10:05.960
Wasabi:
Did you not hear her?!

10:08.620 --> 10:10.420
We're gonna need something
to slow him down.

10:10.420 --> 10:12.250
I have just the thing.

10:17.500 --> 10:19.710
(Wasabi screaming)

10:20.750 --> 10:22.210
Still not stopping!

10:22.210 --> 10:24.170
Oh, yes he is!

10:24.170 --> 10:25.460
(tires squeal)

10:25.460 --> 10:27.080
They fear the lizard.

10:28.080 --> 10:29.880
Ha! Justice has
been served--

10:29.880 --> 10:31.380
Oh, wait a minute.

10:31.380 --> 10:33.880
-(panting)
-Are you people crazy?

10:33.880 --> 10:36.330
My wife is about to have
our baby!

10:36.330 --> 10:37.920
Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry.

10:37.920 --> 10:39.250
You're doing great.

10:39.250 --> 10:40.290
Boy or girl?

10:40.290 --> 10:42.170
Wait, don't tell me,
I wanna be surprised.

10:42.170 --> 10:44.880
-(wife groans)
-Congratulations
on your bundle of joy!

10:46.120 --> 10:48.500
So, not a car thief,

10:48.500 --> 10:50.420
but we still showed
some real hustle
out there, guys.

10:50.420 --> 10:52.380
Fred, there's clearly
nothing going on.

10:53.750 --> 10:56.290
(sadly)
But, guys,
night patrol.

11:00.710 --> 11:02.380
(electrical explosion)

11:02.380 --> 11:03.920
Uh, that's not good.

11:07.290 --> 11:09.460
(Baymax powering down)

11:09.460 --> 11:12.380
(laughs)
I haven't seen you
at the bot fights in a while,

11:12.380 --> 11:13.750
little Zero.

11:13.750 --> 11:16.120
Not since the night you got me
locked up in jail.

11:16.120 --> 11:18.250
You're not still mad
about that...

11:18.250 --> 11:19.420
are you?

11:21.000 --> 11:24.170
Okay, well,
I'm sorry.

11:24.170 --> 11:25.460
If I could just get
my robot back--

11:25.460 --> 11:27.790
You're not getting
your robot back.

11:27.790 --> 11:29.170
Teach him a lesson.

11:29.170 --> 11:32.000
In case I wasn't clear before,

11:32.000 --> 11:34.290
I'm really sorry about
the whole jail thing.

11:36.790 --> 11:38.460
Ah!

11:38.460 --> 11:40.710
Wait, you go to that
nerd school?

11:40.710 --> 11:43.710
-Uh, yeah, but it's not--
-Pull him back.

11:43.710 --> 11:46.540
You and I,
we're gonna make a deal.

11:49.330 --> 11:51.170
Alone he stood,

11:51.170 --> 11:52.420
buffeted by the rain,

11:52.420 --> 11:54.330
unwavering in his mission,

11:54.330 --> 11:56.250
and undaunted by the fact
that his friends

11:56.250 --> 11:59.500
don't value superhero culture
in all its awesomeness.

11:59.500 --> 12:02.500
Master Frederick,
hot cocoa?

12:02.500 --> 12:06.420
Heathcliff, where's Fred?
I need his help.

12:06.420 --> 12:08.170
Okay, so what wrong

12:08.170 --> 12:10.290
is Lady Justice
calling us to right?

12:10.290 --> 12:12.210
Well, there's this
metal thing--

12:12.210 --> 12:15.040
it's kind of a sculpture,
or paperweight or something--

12:15.040 --> 12:17.500
and it's on Granville's desk
and I have to break in
and take it.

12:17.500 --> 12:19.380
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait.

12:19.380 --> 12:21.830
That is what Lady Justice
would call stealing.

12:21.830 --> 12:24.790
Stealing?
No, it's not stealing.

12:24.790 --> 12:27.290
Is it stealing?
I don't think
it's really stealing.

12:27.290 --> 12:29.460
It's more like
borrowing, yeah.

12:29.460 --> 12:31.460
Baymax:
Stealing:
to take the property

12:31.460 --> 12:33.500
of another without
permission or right.

12:33.500 --> 12:35.000
Exactly.
Thank you, Baymax.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.830
Wait, Baymax? Whoa!

12:36.830 --> 12:38.620
You live in a computer now?

12:38.620 --> 12:40.670
My body ran away.

12:40.670 --> 12:43.540
Fred, look, I rebuilt
Baymax's skeleton.

12:43.540 --> 12:46.250
It went crazy, got loose,
and now Yama has it.

12:46.250 --> 12:48.500
The thing is,
it's dangerous without
Tadashi's chip.

12:48.500 --> 12:50.580
Without the healthcare
protocol,

12:50.580 --> 12:53.710
my robotic capabilities
could be catastrophically
destructive.

12:53.710 --> 12:56.620
Yama said he'll
give it back in exchange
for the paperweight thing.

12:56.620 --> 12:58.540
Which you intend to steal.

12:58.540 --> 13:01.380
As soon as I make the trade,
I'll steal the thing back

13:01.380 --> 13:03.080
and return it
to Professor Granville

13:03.080 --> 13:04.790
before she even
knows it's gone.

13:04.790 --> 13:08.120
So, the second steal
basically cancels out
the first steal.

13:08.120 --> 13:09.880
Okay, I'm in.

13:09.880 --> 13:12.500
Yes! I just need to add
her code to my ID,

13:12.500 --> 13:15.120
and to do that,
I need to get really close
to Professor Granville.

13:15.120 --> 13:17.000
How close?
Are we talking in the same
general vicinity,

13:17.000 --> 13:18.620
or are we talking
uncomfortably close?

13:18.620 --> 13:20.620
Uncomfortably close.

13:22.250 --> 13:24.330
Fred:
Hiro, check, check.
Can you hear me?

13:24.330 --> 13:27.580
Fred, just wait for the signal
and hit the button.

13:27.580 --> 13:30.290
I've never been
a hacker before.
(nervous laughter)

13:30.290 --> 13:32.960
This is exciting.
Also, a lot of pressure.

13:32.960 --> 13:34.790
Uh, which button is it again?

13:34.790 --> 13:37.120
I kid, I kid.

13:37.120 --> 13:39.000
Don't worry, Hiro,
I've got this.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.580
(door opens)

13:42.750 --> 13:44.540
Target spotted. I'm going in.

13:44.540 --> 13:46.750
Roger that.
Man, I love saying that.

13:46.750 --> 13:48.500
I'll do it again.
(deep voice) Roger that.

13:48.500 --> 13:49.580
No, no, no, wait.
How about this?

13:49.580 --> 13:50.710
(British accent)
Roger that.

13:50.710 --> 13:52.710
Baymax:
Who is Roger?

13:52.710 --> 13:54.000
Fred:
You know,
that's a good question.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.620
-Guys, quiet.
-Roger that!

13:55.620 --> 13:58.170
Excuse me,
Professor Granville?

13:58.170 --> 13:59.250
Yes, Mr. Hamada?

13:59.250 --> 14:02.170
Well, I was thinking about
what you said,

14:02.170 --> 14:05.420
and it's nice
to have someone here
who believes in me,

14:05.420 --> 14:06.580
so thank you.

14:06.580 --> 14:08.250
Yes, well, uh--

14:09.750 --> 14:11.210
(Hiro giggles)

14:11.210 --> 14:13.250
What is he doing?

14:16.040 --> 14:17.880
Is that all?

14:17.880 --> 14:19.830
Um... well...

14:19.830 --> 14:21.710
Fred:
Turn on the waterworks.
Trust me.

14:21.710 --> 14:23.080
It's the only way
you're gonna get that hug.

14:25.120 --> 14:27.620
Mr. Hamada,
are you all right?

14:27.620 --> 14:29.750
I'm...

14:29.750 --> 14:31.710
Is there something
in your eye?

14:31.710 --> 14:34.540
Tears. There's just
so much going on.

14:35.790 --> 14:37.960
-Now.
-(slurps) I'm on it.

14:37.960 --> 14:40.960
Ah! I spilled soup! Ow!

14:40.960 --> 14:42.710
Ow! Ow! Ah!

14:45.210 --> 14:48.170
Baymax:
I cannot administer care
because I have no body.

14:48.170 --> 14:51.670
But I do have several tips
for treating minor burns.

14:53.380 --> 14:55.670
All right, now.
Pull yourself together.

14:56.710 --> 14:58.790
I got the copy!
I think.

14:58.790 --> 15:00.420
Thanks! I feel better now.

15:00.420 --> 15:01.790
Thank goodness.

15:01.790 --> 15:03.620
Don't wanna keep
my professor waiting.

15:03.620 --> 15:06.460
She's intermittently fair
and a good hugger.

15:16.580 --> 15:18.880
♪ ♪

15:23.170 --> 15:25.670
Fred:
What's happening?

15:25.670 --> 15:27.170
-Did you get it?
-Yeah.

15:27.170 --> 15:28.790
It's heavier than it looks.

15:28.790 --> 15:30.420
Why would Yama want this?

15:30.420 --> 15:32.750
Ow! Hot soup!
Spilled it again.

15:32.750 --> 15:35.080
These are dangerous
people, Fred.

15:35.080 --> 15:37.040
-Let me do the talking.
-You bet.

15:37.040 --> 15:39.710
I'll keep my eyes peeled
and my lips sealed.

15:39.710 --> 15:41.830
What do you want?

15:41.830 --> 15:44.330
-We're. uh--
-Frederick Frederickson
the Fourth.

15:44.330 --> 15:46.540
This is Hiro.
We're very busy,
dangerous types

15:46.540 --> 15:48.420
and we don't like
to be kept waiting.

16:01.830 --> 16:04.210
What happened to letting
me do the talking?

16:04.210 --> 16:06.460
Now, you and I both know
that was never gonna work.

16:06.460 --> 16:09.750
Hiro, we're going
to Noodle Burger.
You wanna come?

16:09.750 --> 16:11.880
-(gasps)
-Go Go: What happened?

16:11.880 --> 16:14.080
My body ran away.

16:14.080 --> 16:15.380
All: Baymax!

16:15.380 --> 16:17.420
You're back!
Wait, why are you
in the computer?

16:17.420 --> 16:18.790
And where's Hiro?

16:18.790 --> 16:20.920
Hiro can be found here.

16:20.920 --> 16:22.580
That's Good Luck Alley.

16:22.580 --> 16:24.250
Why do they call it
Good Luck Alley?

16:24.250 --> 16:25.880
Good luck getting out alive.

16:25.880 --> 16:27.500
(gasps)

16:30.210 --> 16:32.040
That's Baymax's skeleton?

16:32.040 --> 16:34.330
It's so... naked.

16:34.330 --> 16:36.040
It's naked Baymax.

16:36.040 --> 16:38.210
And you must be Yama.

16:42.620 --> 16:44.920
-We had a deal!
-Oh, Zero,

16:44.920 --> 16:48.000
did you really think
I was going to give you
back your robot?

16:48.000 --> 16:50.580
That was my understanding.
Did nobody else think that?

16:52.710 --> 16:54.790
-Ow!
-Hey.

16:57.170 --> 17:00.120
Great. No windows,
no air ducts,

17:00.120 --> 17:01.170
and one locked door.

17:01.170 --> 17:03.330
Looks like
we need to break out

17:03.330 --> 17:06.120
of a super secure,
high-tech safe room.

17:06.120 --> 17:07.830
Awesome!

17:07.830 --> 17:09.290
How do we do that?

17:09.290 --> 17:10.460
Oh, I've got it!

17:10.460 --> 17:11.750
We could do what
Dirk Dinley did

17:11.750 --> 17:13.420
when he was trapped
in the dungeon
of Dr. Slaughter.

17:13.420 --> 17:15.920
Get this.
He fashioned a key
out of a stale cracker

17:15.920 --> 17:17.380
and a single strand
of his own hair.

17:18.750 --> 17:20.540
Or, we...
yeah, that'll work, too.

17:20.540 --> 17:21.750
-We could just unlock--
-Come on.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.880
So after we get
naked Baymax back,

17:25.880 --> 17:27.290
what's our exit strategy?

17:27.290 --> 17:28.540
You thinking fists?

17:28.540 --> 17:29.830
You thinking something
other than fists?

17:29.830 --> 17:31.330
I'm thinking we run.

17:31.330 --> 17:33.040
So feet. We're gonna
go with feet.

17:33.040 --> 17:35.380
Where do you think
you're going?

17:35.380 --> 17:37.830
-And you're sure not fists?
-Feet, Fred. Fast!

17:38.830 --> 17:39.920
Hey.

17:39.920 --> 17:42.880
Come on, let's take
these two to Yama.

17:42.880 --> 17:44.880
Well, if you think about it,
I did you a favor

17:44.880 --> 17:46.080
by testing your security.

17:46.080 --> 17:47.960
Thank you. Get rid of 'em!

17:47.960 --> 17:50.420
Quick question,
when you say,
"get rid of us,"

17:50.420 --> 17:52.750
do you mean throw us out,
or are you talking more of a,

17:52.750 --> 17:54.120
you know,
permanent situation?

17:56.120 --> 17:57.960
Permanent. Got it.

17:57.960 --> 17:59.420
No, wait!

17:59.420 --> 18:01.920
(loud rumbling)

18:04.460 --> 18:06.330
Huh?

18:06.330 --> 18:09.620
Yeah!
I knew you couldn't resist
the call of superhero-dom.

18:19.960 --> 18:21.330
Hi-ya!

18:21.330 --> 18:23.750
Yeah, that's right.

18:25.120 --> 18:26.880
That's wrong!

18:29.920 --> 18:31.330
Ah!

18:31.330 --> 18:33.960
Ya! Ya! Ya! Hi-ya!

18:33.960 --> 18:35.540
(electricity crackling)

18:35.540 --> 18:37.670
Adrenaline's back!

18:43.380 --> 18:45.420
Hiro, Fred,
you guys okay?

18:45.420 --> 18:47.420
-Much better now.
-How'd you know we were here?

18:47.420 --> 18:50.040
Wait, were you guys
out on night patrol
without me?

18:50.040 --> 18:52.580
Fred, night patrol
is not a thing.

18:52.580 --> 18:54.460
It's really not.

18:54.460 --> 18:55.920
Look out!

18:55.920 --> 18:58.290
That was close.
Did you see how close
that was?

18:59.420 --> 19:00.830
Stay here.

19:00.830 --> 19:02.330
Roger that.

19:06.420 --> 19:08.080
Nobody hustles Yama.

19:08.080 --> 19:09.460
And gets away with it?

19:11.330 --> 19:12.880
Well, looks like I just did.

19:12.880 --> 19:14.790
Ooh, that's cold.

19:14.790 --> 19:16.290
(chuckles)
Did, uh, everybody--

19:16.290 --> 19:18.420
Did you guys get that?

19:18.420 --> 19:20.080
Go Go:
Hang on!

19:20.080 --> 19:21.920
Fred:
Hey, it's Heathcliff!

19:30.500 --> 19:32.750
So, I'm sensing you're angry?

19:32.750 --> 19:34.580
Without my scanning
capabilities,

19:34.580 --> 19:37.960
I am unable to detect
nonverbal signs of anger.

19:37.960 --> 19:39.080
Are they glaring?

19:39.080 --> 19:42.460
Are their eyebrows down
and together?

19:42.460 --> 19:44.040
Do you see narrowing
of their lips?

19:44.040 --> 19:45.330
I got this, Baymax.

19:45.330 --> 19:48.210
Guys, I'm sorry I didn't
tell you what I was doing.

19:48.210 --> 19:49.960
You could have gotten hurt.

19:49.960 --> 19:53.380
And I can't believe you stole
something from Professor
Granville's desk!

19:53.380 --> 19:56.080
And you helped him.
And now Yama has it!

19:56.080 --> 19:56.830
Well...

19:58.080 --> 19:59.250
Double steal!

19:59.250 --> 20:01.330
-As promised.
-I'm impressed.

20:01.330 --> 20:03.000
But don't ever
do that again.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.330
I won't but there is still
one problem.

20:05.330 --> 20:07.920
How am I gonna explain that
to Professor Granville?

20:07.920 --> 20:10.580
Don't worry,
I'll take care of that.

20:10.580 --> 20:12.250
Just this once.

20:23.710 --> 20:25.920
Come on, come on, come on!

20:25.920 --> 20:27.040
Yes!

20:43.120 --> 20:44.710
Hiro:
Ow.

20:44.710 --> 20:45.920
I am Baymax,

20:45.920 --> 20:48.000
your personal healthcare
companion.

20:49.040 --> 20:50.710
Hello, Hiro.

20:54.830 --> 20:57.460
He is not gonna be happy
that we didn't get it.

20:57.460 --> 21:01.580
Don't worry, we got something
much, much better.

21:14.960 --> 21:17.620
Dolphin-safe tuna nachos
coming through!

21:17.620 --> 21:19.380
Hot plate.

21:19.380 --> 21:22.000
Really hot plate.
Just keep the kitten mits
on for a while, will you?

21:23.040 --> 21:24.540
(slurping)

21:24.540 --> 21:27.210

I need you to act like
one of the bad Baymaxes.

32:51.500 --> 32:53.880
"Act" is not a command
I understand.

-What?
-I was alerted to the need
for medical attention

33:58.460 --> 34:00.080
when you said, "ow."

34:00.080 --> 34:01.920
On a scale of one to ten,

34:01.920 --> 34:03.500
how would you rate your pain?

34:03.500 --> 34:05.170
