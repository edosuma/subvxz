00:19.185 --> 00:21.016
It's alive!

00:41.875 --> 00:45.106
Oh, sweet [Bleep]
in a birch bark canoe!

00:45.145 --> 00:48.603
You, all right?
I learned it from watching you!

00:48.648 --> 00:50.445
Whew, man.

00:50.483 --> 00:53.543
It's... not easy
being William Shatner.

00:53.586 --> 00:56.020
Actor, singer... rancher...

00:56.056 --> 00:58.388
all-around... macho hombre.

00:58.425 --> 01:00.052
Oh, yeah.

01:03.029 --> 01:06.362
Time to... beam me down
a good night's sleep.

01:21.181 --> 01:22.614
You're needed.

01:33.259 --> 01:38.526
Huh. So, you have come back,
<i>mi amor.</i>

01:38.565 --> 01:40.260
<i>Oh, s'il vous pla√Æt.</i>

01:40.300 --> 01:42.291
I know I do not
deserve forgiveness...

01:42.335 --> 01:44.860
but give me one last chance, no?

01:44.904 --> 01:47.338
What you're here for,
it is not important.

01:47.373 --> 01:49.466
All that matters is our love.

01:49.509 --> 01:51.534
Oh, run away with me.

01:54.714 --> 01:56.807
I curse you.

01:56.850 --> 02:00.251
Here. You'll find them
at this address.

02:01.554 --> 02:03.283
Finally, the secret is ours.

02:03.323 --> 02:05.154
They will have to accept
our demands now.

02:06.292 --> 02:08.852
Ohh! You!
Ohh! You!

02:14.134 --> 02:17.035
You shot me!

02:17.070 --> 02:19.630
The world is safe again
thanks to you.

02:26.946 --> 02:28.743
Yawn.

02:31.251 --> 02:35.187
Where do these things...
keep... coming from?

02:36.623 --> 02:38.250
Shazam!

02:39.859 --> 02:43.590
I did it. I reunited
that boy with his puppy.

02:44.664 --> 02:46.564
What the...

02:46.599 --> 02:49.591
Come here, baby.
What's taking so long?

02:50.904 --> 02:52.462
Oh, boy.

02:52.505 --> 02:55.702
There's no such thing
as stupid questions...

02:55.742 --> 02:58.768
except for Billy's questions.

02:58.811 --> 03:00.745
You're not really an atheist,
are you, Todd?

03:00.780 --> 03:04.147
Look, I just don't believe
in the whole heaven-hell thing.

03:05.552 --> 03:07.383
Wow, what an unfortunate, uh...

03:07.420 --> 03:10.048
- Plot device?
- Yeah. Plot device.

03:12.058 --> 03:15.289
Holy [Bleep].
Heaven <i>does</i> exist.

03:16.796 --> 03:20.232
Holy [Bleep]. It's beautiful.

03:24.070 --> 03:25.264
What... what's going on?

03:25.305 --> 03:26.636
Down! Down!

03:29.475 --> 03:31.966
Damn you, F.A. A!

03:37.450 --> 03:38.474
Todd.

03:38.518 --> 03:40.452
Holy [Bleep]. Grandma!

03:40.486 --> 03:42.420
It's so good to see you.

03:42.455 --> 03:44.685
And... Uncle Steve.

03:44.724 --> 03:47.386
Holy [Bleep].
They let you in here?

03:47.427 --> 03:49.258
Yeah. Turns out
we were doing stuff...

03:49.295 --> 03:51.991
the priests
were into themselves.

03:52.031 --> 03:53.293
Lucky me.

03:54.467 --> 03:56.162
I was a serial killer...

03:56.202 --> 03:58.329
but repented in prison
and went to heaven.

03:58.371 --> 04:01.704
I killed hundreds
in the name of our Lord.

04:03.710 --> 04:06.042
Well, I'm just as surprised
as you are.

04:07.247 --> 04:08.805
Uh, hey. You work here.

04:08.848 --> 04:11.373
Since day one.
What can I do for you?

04:11.417 --> 04:13.248
What's with the hypocrisy
around here?

04:13.286 --> 04:14.753
Why is Uncle Steve here?

04:14.787 --> 04:17.517
And the serial killer gets in
because he repents?

04:17.557 --> 04:19.184
Well, if you're
gonna bitch so much...

04:19.225 --> 04:21.192
I can return you to earth
at any time.

04:21.226 --> 04:22.626
- Really?
- Sure.

04:22.662 --> 04:24.789
Just look over there.

04:29.235 --> 04:31.430
Ohh, douchebag.

04:31.471 --> 04:33.371
So there was this truck,
and it came out of nowhere...

04:33.406 --> 04:35.203
you see, and it hit our friend.

04:37.610 --> 04:39.202
Holy [Bleep].

04:39.245 --> 04:40.678
It's a miracle.

04:40.713 --> 04:42.840
Hey, guys, I'm back!

04:42.882 --> 04:44.941
And I have so much to...

04:47.987 --> 04:50.148
Wow. That's, uh...
that's so, um...

04:50.189 --> 04:53.352
- Ironic?
- Yeah, yeah. Ironic.

04:58.031 --> 05:00.659
Sam, Ziggy says
in order to leap out...

05:00.700 --> 05:03.464
you got to work the shaft.
Work the shaft, Sam.

05:03.503 --> 05:06.199
There you go.

05:06.239 --> 05:08.070
China is in here, Mr. Burton.

05:09.375 --> 05:11.900
Wow! I can record
my favorite shows...

05:11.944 --> 05:15.175
and teach it to record
other shows that I like!

05:15.214 --> 05:18.775
This is great! What did I do
without this thing?

05:18.818 --> 05:20.217
- Hello?
- Hey, buddy.

05:20.253 --> 05:22.278
We're heading out to the bar.
You want to come?

05:22.322 --> 05:24.222
Why don't you take your bar
and shove it up your ass?

05:24.257 --> 05:25.656
I'm watching TiVo!

05:25.692 --> 05:26.818
But, but...

05:29.429 --> 05:31.090
- Hello?
- This is your boss.

05:31.130 --> 05:34.122
You're very late.
Are you even coming in today?

05:34.167 --> 05:37.034
No. Uh, TiVo.

05:37.070 --> 05:38.264
You're fired!

05:40.373 --> 05:44.400
Oh, my God. My poor baby.
You just get off the couch...

05:44.444 --> 05:45.741
and come with me.
Mom is here to help.

05:45.778 --> 05:49.179
We got to go, baby. We got to go
and get some help. Come on.

05:49.215 --> 05:51.115
We'll get through this together.

05:51.150 --> 05:53.277
You just get off that couch
and get up.

06:02.261 --> 06:05.719
Love... you... TiVo.

06:08.634 --> 06:11.694
TiVo. It'll change your life.

06:11.738 --> 06:14.172
No, it's not a tumor.
It's not a tumor at all.

06:14.207 --> 06:17.370
The amazing true story that touched
the hearts of generations...

06:17.410 --> 06:19.776
is now a motion picture
you'll never forget.

06:19.812 --> 06:22.076
"Dear diary,
this is my chronicle...

06:22.115 --> 06:24.140
"Of a most unfortunate time.

06:25.785 --> 06:29.312
"My name is Anne. Anne Frank."

06:29.355 --> 06:30.379
Awesome.

06:30.423 --> 06:34.519
"Luckily, everything I want
is right here."

06:34.560 --> 06:39.827
My bread is so unleavened

06:39.866 --> 06:43.358
Let the Nazis come
and take my friends

06:43.403 --> 06:47.499
Gonna pray all day
till the Sabbath ends

06:47.540 --> 06:49.405
I want to punch that Hitler...

06:49.442 --> 06:52.070
- The Nazis are here!
- I'm on it, Dad!

06:53.880 --> 06:55.074
<i>Achtung!</i>

06:56.182 --> 06:57.342
<i>Mein Kampf!</i>

07:01.287 --> 07:03.016
<i>Wiener schnitzel!</i>

07:03.055 --> 07:04.784
You're really something,
Anne Frank.

07:04.824 --> 07:07.054
Heh, I'm just me.

07:10.196 --> 07:11.925
Nazis are so uncool.

07:14.066 --> 07:17.627
Don't put the baby
in the bulldozer.

07:17.670 --> 07:20.537
Dude, West Nile virus rules.

07:20.573 --> 07:21.733
Word.

07:21.774 --> 07:23.537
A jumper's standoff
with police...

07:23.576 --> 07:26.374
came to a tragic end
on the Brooklyn Bridge today...

07:26.412 --> 07:28.141
as an unidentified
skull-faced man...

07:28.181 --> 07:30.649
brought traffic to a standstill
for two hours...

07:30.683 --> 07:32.173
before leaping to his death.

07:33.352 --> 07:36.082
All too common.
You ever wonder what became...

07:36.122 --> 07:38.215
of those playthings
of yesteryear?

07:38.257 --> 07:40.748
If you're the CEO
of a <i>Fortune</i> 500 company...

07:40.793 --> 07:42.727
you're probably too busy
counting money...

07:42.762 --> 07:45.754
on the naked back of
a $10,000-a-night whore to care.

07:45.798 --> 07:46.890
But I care.

07:46.933 --> 07:48.730
Man-At-Arms...

07:48.768 --> 07:50.668
killed in a hail
of Crip gunfire...

07:50.703 --> 07:52.933
on the streets
of South Central Los Angeles.

07:52.972 --> 07:54.564
Beast-Man...

07:54.607 --> 07:56.438
currently dodging
child support payments...

07:56.476 --> 07:59.001
under an assumed name
in Akron, Ohio.

07:59.045 --> 08:00.410
We see you.

08:00.446 --> 08:01.879
Trap-Jaw...

08:01.914 --> 08:04.007
now a South Dakota
state senator.

08:04.050 --> 08:08.043
Sad fates for those once known
as the Masters of the Universe.

08:08.087 --> 08:10.681
For more perspective,
we've come to Prince Adam...

08:10.723 --> 08:13.453
best known as
the champion of Eternia, He-Man.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.484
He-Man,
you're currently employed...

08:15.528 --> 08:17.189
as a mall security guard.

08:17.230 --> 08:19.027
How did it come to this?

08:19.065 --> 08:20.794
Yeah, well...

08:20.833 --> 08:22.664
Hey, you! Stop!

08:24.604 --> 08:27.129
By the power of Grayskull!

08:28.241 --> 08:29.538
Oh, look! He's got a sword!

08:29.575 --> 08:31.736
Once the leader
of the mighty Thundercats...

08:31.777 --> 08:34.337
today Lion-O is an unemployed
construction worker...

08:34.380 --> 08:36.575
staring down the big 4-0.

08:36.616 --> 08:38.846
After Mumm-Ra died
of testicular cancer...

08:38.885 --> 08:41.284
there wasn't nobody left
for the Thundercats to fight.

08:41.320 --> 08:42.650
We had to get real jobs.

08:42.688 --> 08:45.384
Mm-hmm. Was construction
your first job?

08:47.326 --> 08:48.486
Oh, yeah!

08:48.528 --> 08:49.688
Oh, God!

08:49.729 --> 08:51.629
And how about the others?

08:51.664 --> 08:54.030
Panthro's doing a dime
in federal prison...

08:54.066 --> 08:56.728
for selling junk bonds
to senior citizens...

08:56.769 --> 08:58.498
and then eating them.

08:58.538 --> 08:59.937
Snarf, Snarf.

08:59.972 --> 09:01.462
No-good Robear Berbil.

09:01.507 --> 09:02.496
Snarf!

09:02.542 --> 09:04.009
I don't know
what happened to Snarf.

09:04.043 --> 09:08.309
And what happened to the team's
sexy female member, Cheetara?

09:09.448 --> 09:11.439
She's still my sexy lady,
I guess.

09:11.484 --> 09:14.817
Oh, hey, you want to go out back
and shoot some cans with a .22?

09:14.854 --> 09:16.981
Not every toy
meets with despair.

09:17.023 --> 09:19.787
Some, like the Transformer
known as Soundwave here...

09:19.825 --> 09:23.226
have managed to find steady,
honest work out of the limelight.

09:23.262 --> 09:26.095
Soundwave, what's the secret
of your success?

09:26.132 --> 09:28.498
Well, I just try
not to dwell on the past.

09:28.534 --> 09:30.559
I have a family
to support now, and...

09:30.603 --> 09:33.436
Can you hang on a minute?
I've got a customer.

09:34.941 --> 09:36.203
Oh, oh, man.

09:36.242 --> 09:37.903
It may not seem like much...

09:37.944 --> 09:41.004
but it's an honest day's paycheck
for an honest day's...

09:43.182 --> 09:45.116
It's an honest...

09:50.456 --> 09:53.914
Some legends burn out
or simply fade away...

09:53.960 --> 09:56.827
but some manage to adapt
to changing times.

09:56.862 --> 09:59.387
Destro, you were once
a member of Cobra...

09:59.432 --> 10:01.366
the ruthless
terrorist organization...

10:01.400 --> 10:03.129
determined to rule the world.

10:03.169 --> 10:05.729
From arms dealer
to used car dealer.

10:05.771 --> 10:07.033
What happened?

10:07.073 --> 10:09.064
Everyone just
sort of lost interest.

10:09.108 --> 10:10.598
I think as you get older...

10:10.643 --> 10:13.407
ruling the world just seems
like too much trouble.

10:13.446 --> 10:16.074
And what became of
the once-feared leader of Cobra...

10:16.115 --> 10:18.015
the notorious Cobra commander?

10:18.050 --> 10:19.950
Our callers
just can't get enough...

10:19.986 --> 10:22.147
of these double-belt
pleated pantsuits.

10:22.188 --> 10:23.678
I know.

10:23.723 --> 10:25.088
Hey, watch your mouth!

10:25.124 --> 10:26.751
I'm the one...
You tell me when...

10:26.792 --> 10:29.056
You say another thing,
I'll flip the bitch switch.

10:29.095 --> 10:31.427
You get your hands off me!
Whoa!

10:31.464 --> 10:33.489
Nobody knows what happened
to Shipwreck.

10:33.532 --> 10:35.523
It's easy to forget
about the toys...

10:35.568 --> 10:37.536
that filled our happy,
youthful days...

10:37.570 --> 10:41.438
but as Americans, we must never
forget to treat everyone...

10:41.474 --> 10:45.570
with honor, decency,
and respect.

10:45.611 --> 10:47.374
Am I done yet?

10:47.413 --> 10:50.849
You'll know, She-Ra.
You'll know.
