00:22.259 --> 00:24.477
Wow, still can't believe this sale.

00:24.511 --> 00:27.196
Six thousand low-fold
dispenser napkins for $58?

00:27.230 --> 00:28.531
What are they thinking?

00:28.566 --> 00:29.766
I don't know.

00:29.800 --> 00:31.501
Yeah, and they're
two-ply.

00:31.535 --> 00:33.519
This is...
this is a great day.

00:33.554 --> 00:36.039
A really great day.

00:36.073 --> 00:39.592
Wow, look how big and empty
the parking lot is,

00:39.627 --> 00:41.527
huh?

00:41.562 --> 00:44.246
What do you say you
get behind the wheel?

00:44.265 --> 00:45.398
What would I do behind the wheel?

00:45.432 --> 00:46.532
Drive.

00:46.567 --> 00:47.767
Is that legal?

00:47.801 --> 00:49.502
Well, no, but my father let me drive

00:49.536 --> 00:51.070
when I was about your age.

00:51.105 --> 00:53.673
Call it a perk for running
errands with your dad.

00:53.707 --> 00:56.426
Let's make this kitty purr.

00:59.380 --> 01:01.047
Mm, go ahead.
Try a turn.

01:02.549 --> 01:04.733
Tina, why are you groaning?
You're doing fine.

01:05.886 --> 01:07.754
Rela... Tina, relax. Easy, easy.

01:09.439 --> 01:11.708
Okay, okay.

01:11.742 --> 01:13.275
Tina, you're kind of headed toward

01:13.294 --> 01:14.911
the only other car in the lot.

01:14.945 --> 01:17.130
You have plenty of time to turn, Tina,

01:17.164 --> 01:18.431
so just go ahead.

01:18.465 --> 01:20.583
Turn one way or the other...

01:20.617 --> 01:22.552
You're just swerving back and forth.

01:22.586 --> 01:24.637
Turn one way and stick with it, Tina.

01:26.590 --> 01:29.475
Tina, for the love of God,
turn away or stop!

01:29.510 --> 01:31.460
The brakes, Tina!
On the left!

01:31.478 --> 01:32.278
You're about to hit that car!

01:32.313 --> 01:33.462
The brakes!
Hit the brakes!

01:34.915 --> 01:36.215
Oh, my God, it's bad.

01:36.250 --> 01:37.250
I ruined the car!

01:37.284 --> 01:39.118
You did.
You really did.

01:39.153 --> 01:41.955
Okay, uh...
Well, that's... Ugh.

01:41.989 --> 01:43.122
At least there doesn't seem to be

01:43.157 --> 01:44.324
any damage to the other car.

01:44.358 --> 01:46.459
No, I see a dent!
There's a dent!

01:46.493 --> 01:49.228
That-That's a ding. Not even.
It's like a little scratch.

01:49.263 --> 01:49.996
N-No, it's a dent!

01:50.030 --> 01:51.497
All right, we'll leave a note.

01:51.532 --> 01:53.082
You know, then again, for all we know,

01:53.117 --> 01:54.484
that probably was there, right?

01:54.518 --> 01:56.269
We have to leave a note!
We have to leave a note!

01:56.303 --> 01:58.571
Okay, okay! You're-
You're so honest.

01:58.605 --> 01:59.772
Who raised you?

01:59.807 --> 02:00.807
I don't know.

02:00.841 --> 02:02.775
Da... It was me. I did.

02:04.712 --> 02:06.462
What's with the cab?

02:06.496 --> 02:07.530
Yeah, where's the car?

02:07.564 --> 02:09.132
Um, the car is in the shop.

02:09.166 --> 02:10.633
There was a little accident and...

02:10.668 --> 02:11.701
What?!

02:11.735 --> 02:13.102
Wait, Lin, Lin.
What?

02:13.137 --> 02:15.138
What happened?
Calm down. We hit a parked car.

02:15.172 --> 02:16.439
Are you okay?
What happened?

02:16.473 --> 02:17.974
My baby, wa...
Look at me.

02:18.008 --> 02:19.659
Look at me. Oh, God.
We're fine. Tina is fine.

02:19.693 --> 02:21.627
Oh, my baby.
Oh, my baby.

02:21.662 --> 02:23.830
Wait, how'd you manage
to hit a parked car?

02:23.864 --> 02:25.431
Are you drunk?
No.

02:25.466 --> 02:26.933
You smell like wine.

02:26.967 --> 02:28.768
We-we were coming out

02:28.802 --> 02:30.036
of the restaurant supply store and...

02:30.070 --> 02:31.688
Hold on.

02:31.722 --> 02:33.222
Bob's Burgers.

02:33.257 --> 02:34.624
Oh, hi, Jimmy.

02:34.658 --> 02:35.842
Yeah, he's right here.

02:35.876 --> 02:37.110
It's Jimmy Pesto.

02:37.144 --> 02:38.311
Ugh, what does he want?

02:38.345 --> 02:39.779
Hello, Jimmy.

02:39.813 --> 02:41.731
Hello, Bob, want to hear
a knock-knock joke?

02:41.765 --> 02:42.865
No.
Knock-knock.

02:42.900 --> 02:44.167
I'm really not in the mood.

02:44.201 --> 02:45.635
Knock-knock!
Ugh, who's there?

02:45.669 --> 02:47.503
You hit my car, dumbass.

02:47.538 --> 02:49.005
Eh, classic knock-knock.

02:49.039 --> 02:51.057
You've got to be kidding me.
That was your car?

02:51.091 --> 02:53.242
Did you or did you not
hear my knock-knock joke?

02:53.277 --> 02:54.477
O-Okay, look,
what happened was...

02:54.511 --> 02:55.728
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

02:55.763 --> 02:57.346
tell it to your insurance company.

02:57.380 --> 02:59.532
Oh, come on, Jimmy.
I don't want my rates to go up.

02:59.566 --> 03:01.317
I'll just pay
whatever the damage is and...

03:01.351 --> 03:02.735
No way. Not on
your salary.

03:02.770 --> 03:04.554
I don't have time for you to work out

03:04.588 --> 03:06.055
an eight-cents-a-month
payment plan.

03:06.090 --> 03:07.156
Ha. He's poor.

03:07.191 --> 03:08.508
Fine.

03:08.542 --> 03:10.159
We'll go through
my insurance. Good-bye!

03:10.194 --> 03:12.228
You drive like a fart!
Fart.

03:12.246 --> 03:14.147
So what happened?

03:14.181 --> 03:17.383
So anyway, I was driving,
and I ran into what turned out

03:17.418 --> 03:19.252
to be Jimmy Pesto's car
in the parking lot.

03:19.286 --> 03:20.853
But, Dad, I was...
Come on, Tina.

03:20.888 --> 03:22.588
Help me carry the napkins
down to the basement.

03:22.623 --> 03:24.424
Okay.
Help you carry napkins?

03:24.458 --> 03:26.359
Yeah, Dad, be sure to lift
with your legs.

03:26.393 --> 03:27.560
Ha-ha.

03:27.594 --> 03:29.062
Use the hand truck.

03:29.096 --> 03:30.880
You shouldn't be carrying
anything at your age.

03:30.914 --> 03:33.416
Yeah, you're pregnant.
You sit down, Dad.

03:33.450 --> 03:35.218
Hey, while your car is in the shop,

03:35.252 --> 03:36.519
I can drive you guys around.

03:36.553 --> 03:37.887
Oh, thank you, Mort,

03:37.921 --> 03:39.555
but we don't need to go anywhere.

03:39.590 --> 03:42.125
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
we'd get to ride in the hearse?

03:42.159 --> 03:44.227
There's lots of places we need to go.

03:44.261 --> 03:45.528
What? Where?

03:45.562 --> 03:47.463
Nightclubs, day clubs, smoky cafes...

03:47.498 --> 03:49.966
Chinatown, Thai Town...
Library.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.235
Great, I'm heading out now
if you want to come with.

03:52.269 --> 03:53.302
I call shotgun.

03:53.337 --> 03:54.437
I call coffin.

03:54.471 --> 03:55.738
No fair, I want coffin!

03:55.773 --> 03:57.106
Good, it was a trick!

03:57.141 --> 03:58.808
I'm too scared to ride coffin.

03:58.842 --> 04:01.410
So we just have to say
I was driving, okay?

04:01.445 --> 04:03.146
That's lying.
That's not right.

04:03.180 --> 04:04.647
That's true, Tina.

04:04.681 --> 04:06.816
Lying is wrong,
and you should never do it.

04:06.850 --> 04:08.584
Unless an idiot named Jimmy Pesto

04:08.619 --> 04:10.486
makes you go through
insurance, which he is.

04:10.521 --> 04:12.488
So we have to lie this one time.

04:12.523 --> 04:15.291
What's next? Perjury?
Human trafficking?

04:15.325 --> 04:17.593
Look, our insurance will go up
a little, but we'll be fine.

04:17.628 --> 04:18.961
We just can't tell anyone about it.

04:18.995 --> 04:20.897
Even Mom?
Ugh, especially Mom.

04:20.930 --> 04:21.964
She can't lie.

04:21.999 --> 04:23.499
But I can't lie, either.

04:23.534 --> 04:25.601
You know what, it's
not even really a lie.

04:25.636 --> 04:26.736
It's a secret.

04:26.770 --> 04:28.604
It's our shared secret.

04:28.639 --> 04:30.606
Huh, maybe if I had a backstory?

04:30.641 --> 04:32.008
A backstory?

04:32.042 --> 04:34.677
Do I have a boyfriend in this scenario?

04:34.711 --> 04:37.513
Uh, we should probably just
stick to the necessary facts.

04:37.548 --> 04:38.648
Oh, okay.

04:38.682 --> 04:40.183
Fine, all right,

04:40.217 --> 04:42.318
you have a secret boyfriend
in this scenario.

04:42.352 --> 04:44.020
One that you can't ever talk about.

04:44.054 --> 04:45.454
What's his name?

04:45.489 --> 04:46.989
Um, Sebastian.

04:47.024 --> 04:48.825
He plays lacrosse, and he loves me.

04:48.859 --> 04:50.827
Mm-hmm.
But he loves lacrosse more.

04:50.861 --> 04:52.695
Uh, yeah.
How long is his hair?

04:52.729 --> 04:54.614
I-I-I don't know,
but it's greasy.

04:54.648 --> 04:56.082
Yes.

04:56.116 --> 04:58.584
So Mort, what special features
does this baby have?

04:58.619 --> 05:00.503
Special features?
Like what?

05:00.537 --> 05:01.971
You know, like an oil slick

05:02.005 --> 05:03.856
in case you're being followed
by mourners?

05:03.891 --> 05:05.525
Oh, no, no, nothing like that.

05:05.559 --> 05:06.809
Is there a hammer in case

05:06.843 --> 05:08.311
one of them comes back to life?

05:08.345 --> 05:09.362
No, no hammers.

05:09.396 --> 05:11.948
I guess you have to use
your bare hands then.

05:11.982 --> 05:13.699
You're cute.
Yeah.

05:13.734 --> 05:15.484
Whoa, how'd you swing that?

05:15.518 --> 05:17.019
Oh, the police escort?

05:17.037 --> 05:18.688
In addition to giving you kids a lift,

05:18.722 --> 05:20.156
I'm also on my way to a funeral.

05:20.190 --> 05:21.874
Killing two birds with one stone.

05:21.909 --> 05:23.459
So there's a dead body back there?

05:23.493 --> 05:25.027
And two birds.

05:25.045 --> 05:26.412
And two buns!

05:28.198 --> 05:29.365
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

05:29.383 --> 05:30.833
Take that, po-po!

05:30.867 --> 05:32.335
Come on, kids, please.
This is not...

05:32.369 --> 05:33.836
Sorry!

05:33.870 --> 05:35.137
Oil slick, go.

05:36.373 --> 05:38.808
Why are you wearing a hair net?

05:38.842 --> 05:40.576
Because stress is making
my hair fall out.

05:40.611 --> 05:42.728
Look at me.

05:42.763 --> 05:44.897
Tina, you have the fullest head
of hair in the family.

05:44.932 --> 05:46.332
I would kill for that hairline.

05:46.366 --> 05:47.633
I believe you would.

05:47.668 --> 05:49.202
Take it easy. Take it easy.

05:49.236 --> 05:51.170
This is all wrong.
I'm going to jail.

05:51.205 --> 05:52.238
Or hell.

05:52.272 --> 05:53.506
Or hell jail.

05:54.758 --> 05:55.875
What's for lunch today?

05:55.909 --> 05:57.559
Your lies!

05:57.578 --> 05:59.161
No!

05:59.196 --> 06:00.763
That's what we had yesterday.

06:00.797 --> 06:02.164
Look, I know it's hard,

06:02.199 --> 06:03.549
but I swear it will get easier.

06:03.584 --> 06:05.151
Just hang in there;
we'll get through this.

06:06.453 --> 06:08.921
Hey, there.
What can I get for you?

06:08.956 --> 06:10.156
Oh, I'm not having anything,

06:10.190 --> 06:11.724
but I do have a few questions.

06:11.758 --> 06:14.260
I'm Chase Kaminsky,
your insurance adjuster.

06:18.932 --> 06:21.000
What's that sound?

06:21.034 --> 06:22.568
Uh, uh, what sound?

06:22.603 --> 06:24.437
I don't hear anything.

06:24.471 --> 06:26.572
Oh that, that, yes, I hear that.

06:26.607 --> 06:28.407
That's probably my daughter.

06:28.442 --> 06:30.543
Is she all right?

06:30.577 --> 06:32.345
I-I-I think it's a song.

06:32.379 --> 06:34.247
She's always singing, so...
it's probably a song.

06:34.281 --> 06:35.915
You know, kids and their music.

06:37.718 --> 06:38.951
Uh, oh.

06:38.986 --> 06:39.733
She passed out.

06:39.853 --> 06:40.885
Better go check on her.

06:44.731 --> 06:46.699
Everything's fine, Tina.
We're going to go out there

06:46.733 --> 06:48.334
and act like
we didn't do anything wrong,

06:48.368 --> 06:49.902
which we didn't, kind of.

06:49.936 --> 06:51.504
But lying to Mom was one thing;

06:51.538 --> 06:54.106
lying to the insurance guy
is another.

06:54.141 --> 06:55.758
Okay, stop, stop making that sound.

06:55.776 --> 06:57.410
He hears it.
Okay.

06:57.444 --> 06:58.878
All right,
let's-let's have you go

06:58.912 --> 07:00.930
down to the basement
and, um, sweep something.

07:00.964 --> 07:03.115
Like dirt?
Yes, like dirt.

07:03.150 --> 07:06.035
So, I was in park,
but I thought it was in drive,

07:06.069 --> 07:08.788
so I was thinking,
"Uh, why am I not moving?"

07:08.822 --> 07:10.356
Yeah, well, we've all done that.

07:10.390 --> 07:12.425
I mean, I haven't,
but somebody must have.

07:12.459 --> 07:14.293
We... you did.

07:15.929 --> 07:17.613
Yeah, I did.

07:20.283 --> 07:22.151
Oh, God.

07:22.185 --> 07:24.153
Uh, this is my daughter, Tina.

07:24.187 --> 07:26.589
Laughing is another one of her noises.

07:26.623 --> 07:27.890
Oh, is that laughing?

07:27.924 --> 07:29.458
I was in the car with my dad.

07:29.493 --> 07:30.926
Uh, in the passenger seat, she was.

07:30.961 --> 07:32.311
Yeah, where passengers sit.

07:32.345 --> 07:33.996
Right, so after I put it in park,

07:34.030 --> 07:37.083
and I was moving,
I thought, "Am I in neutral?"

07:37.117 --> 07:39.468
So I shifted into gear
and lurched forward.

07:39.503 --> 07:41.470
And then a butterfly flew in the window

07:41.505 --> 07:42.788
and Dad started swatting at it.

07:42.823 --> 07:44.156
A butterfly?

07:44.191 --> 07:45.458
What butterfly?
Wha-What butterfly?

07:45.492 --> 07:47.159
Hey, Linda, kids.

07:47.194 --> 07:49.395
Uh, this is Chase.
He's from the insurance company.

07:49.429 --> 07:51.614
I was just telling him
what happened, uh...

07:51.648 --> 07:53.165
Uh, yes, I was...

07:53.200 --> 07:55.584
I was just getting to
the butterfly part of the story.

07:55.619 --> 07:58.254
I thought it was a bee,
and I was startled.

07:58.288 --> 08:00.155
So I was, ah...
swatting at it.

08:00.173 --> 08:01.674
Dad's scared of butterflies.

08:01.708 --> 08:03.776
Uh-oh, Dad, look out.
There's a ladybug!

08:03.810 --> 08:05.327
Stop it.
All right, so, uh,

08:05.345 --> 08:07.162
anyway, back to the story, uh, Chase.

08:07.180 --> 08:09.298
Uh, I mean, not a story;
it's the truth.

08:09.332 --> 08:11.834
Um, so I swerved and...

08:11.852 --> 08:13.319
A cormorant flew in the window.

08:13.353 --> 08:14.487
What's a cormorant?

08:14.521 --> 08:15.688
It's a kind of seabird.

08:15.722 --> 08:17.022
We learned about them in school.

08:17.057 --> 08:18.491
In China they use them to catch fish.

08:18.525 --> 08:19.625
Yeah, thanks, Tina.

08:19.659 --> 08:21.510
Sorry I left out the cormorant.

08:21.528 --> 08:23.963
A cormorant? What
an auspicious sign.

08:23.997 --> 08:26.365
Anyway, that's how I hit the car.

08:26.399 --> 08:28.684
Butterfly, then cormorant.

08:34.039 --> 08:36.392
Okay!
Really?

08:36.426 --> 08:38.126
We'll get your claim check
cut right away.

08:38.160 --> 08:39.562
Thanks for your business, Bob.

08:39.596 --> 08:41.197
Thank you.

08:41.231 --> 08:42.664
That was easy, right? Phew.

08:42.698 --> 08:44.049
One more thing.
Aah! Aah!

08:44.083 --> 08:45.818
It just occurred to me to ask you...

08:45.852 --> 08:46.819
Here it comes.

08:46.853 --> 08:48.404
I'm hosting a barbecue this Sunday.

08:48.438 --> 08:50.489
My caterer fell through.
Boom, I meet you.

08:50.524 --> 08:51.791
What do you say?

08:51.825 --> 08:53.242
You ever take this show on the road?

08:53.276 --> 08:55.227
Oh, um, cater your party?

08:55.262 --> 08:57.413
Mm-hmm.
Sounds great. We'll do it.

08:57.447 --> 08:59.048
Our only other employees are the kids.

08:59.082 --> 09:00.549
Is that... is that okay?

09:03.737 --> 09:05.237
Great!

09:05.272 --> 09:06.489
Here's my number.
Huh.

09:06.523 --> 09:08.190
See you all on Sunday.

09:08.225 --> 09:09.425
Great.

09:11.711 --> 09:13.512
Where's the bathroom
in this thing? Under here?

09:13.547 --> 09:15.181
No. No, it's not there.

09:15.215 --> 09:16.565
Yeah, it's fine.
Well no, just...

09:16.600 --> 09:18.067
Can you just hold it a little longer?

09:18.101 --> 09:19.435
Well, it's not a problem.
No, no, please.

09:19.469 --> 09:21.036
Don't worry about it.

09:21.071 --> 09:22.438
I'm meeting a grieving
widow in ten minutes.

09:22.472 --> 09:24.423
Oh, I have to go,
too. Hey, look!

09:24.457 --> 09:25.658
"Three bedroom, two bath."

09:25.692 --> 09:27.076
We can both go.

09:27.110 --> 09:28.377
Ah, all right.

09:28.411 --> 09:29.395
But make it quick.

09:29.429 --> 09:30.946
Got to go. Got to go. Got to go.

09:30.981 --> 09:32.765
Everything okay in there?

09:32.799 --> 09:34.500
Everything's great.

09:34.534 --> 09:36.218
I had to pee,
but one thing led to another.

09:36.253 --> 09:37.920
Bam, I showered.

09:37.954 --> 09:40.089
So our grandpa died.
That's him out front.

09:40.123 --> 09:41.891
He's in the to-go box.

09:41.925 --> 09:45.928
His last wish was to be buried
at the house he was murdered in.

09:45.962 --> 09:48.564
Yeah, with the shovel
he was murdered with.

09:48.598 --> 09:51.283
Can you believe he was
poisoned with a shovel?

09:52.819 --> 09:54.119
We'll take it!

09:54.154 --> 09:56.372
Kids.
Ah, perfect timing.

09:56.406 --> 09:58.557
Mortimer, give this fellow
a fair price for the house,

09:58.592 --> 10:00.893
and we'll meet you in the car.

10:04.514 --> 10:06.365
Hey, thanks for the lift, Mort.

10:06.399 --> 10:08.601
Uh, shouldn't be more
than a couple hours, so, uh...

10:08.635 --> 10:10.386
are you gonna wait here or come back?

10:10.420 --> 10:12.488
Well, it's an hour back to my place,

10:12.522 --> 10:14.423
so I guess I'll just sit in the hearse.

10:14.457 --> 10:15.958
Maybe grab a nap in the back.

10:15.992 --> 10:17.877
Uh-huh.
A nap in the back of a hearse?

10:17.911 --> 10:19.628
Who says morticians are creepy?

10:19.663 --> 10:23.065
Ha-ha. Well, all this gas
is getting pretty expensive.

10:23.099 --> 10:25.935
A hearse doesn't exactly sip gas.

10:25.969 --> 10:27.603
It's a big vehicle, you know?
Uh-huh.

10:27.637 --> 10:29.655
But you know,
if you would like to chip in

10:29.657 --> 10:31.674
that would be so great because...
Great, we'll see you in a few.

10:31.708 --> 10:32.942
Okay. All right.

10:32.976 --> 10:35.144
See you soon. That's fine.

10:35.178 --> 10:36.512
Why are we even here?

10:36.546 --> 10:38.414
You said it would all be over
after the one lie.

10:38.448 --> 10:40.482
Well, we couldn't exactly
say no to Chase, Tina.

10:40.517 --> 10:41.417
That would make it worse.

10:41.451 --> 10:43.118
After the barbecue, I promise,

10:43.153 --> 10:44.637
everything will go back to normal.

10:44.671 --> 10:45.471
Will it?

10:45.505 --> 10:46.755
Or is that another lie?

10:46.790 --> 10:48.657
Whoa, easy.
You've gotta calm down.

10:48.692 --> 10:51.927
Let's, let's, let's see your
"everything is okay" face.

10:51.962 --> 10:54.163
Um, no, no, no,

10:54.197 --> 10:55.130
that's, that's not, that's...

10:55.165 --> 10:57.633
No, that's bad.
No, don't do that face.

10:57.667 --> 10:58.767
Like, like this?

10:58.802 --> 11:00.436
No. Just stop doing
the face.

11:00.470 --> 11:01.770
How about this?

11:01.805 --> 11:03.172
And stay with me here by the grill.

11:03.206 --> 11:06.008
That way your sweat
will look more natural.

11:06.042 --> 11:07.343
So then a butterfly spooks him,

11:07.377 --> 11:10.346
and he crashes our freaking car!

11:10.380 --> 11:12.281
Hey, your wife has 'em
roaring over there,

11:12.315 --> 11:14.133
talking about your little
fender-bender.

11:14.167 --> 11:16.518
Uh. Uh, Tina, I'll be
right back.

11:16.536 --> 11:17.870
Mm...

11:17.904 --> 11:20.105
Just try and keep the meat off the ground.
Okay...

11:20.140 --> 11:21.657
You heard of the butterfly effect?

11:21.691 --> 11:23.475
If a butterfly flaps its wings,

11:23.510 --> 11:26.478
Bob crashes his car!

11:26.513 --> 11:27.630
Okay, Linda.

11:27.664 --> 11:28.797
Let's, uh, settle down.

11:28.832 --> 11:31.033
Oh, what?
I'm making conversation.

11:31.067 --> 11:33.669
And he says I'm a bad driver!

11:33.703 --> 11:35.287
Ah! Ah...!

11:35.322 --> 11:37.556
Ah...!

11:37.590 --> 11:38.373
Tina!

11:38.391 --> 11:40.175
Oh, call the fire department!

11:41.328 --> 11:43.762
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Ooh! Ooh, my face!

11:47.328 --> 11:49.763
Tina, no one's blaming you for this,

11:49.797 --> 11:51.098
but what wrong thing did you do?!

11:51.132 --> 11:53.066
I don't know.
I was cooking like normal.

11:53.324 --> 11:55.225
Maybe I had the flame too high?

11:55.259 --> 11:57.193
Why would you let me around fire?

11:57.228 --> 11:58.495
All right, Tina, calm down.

11:58.529 --> 11:59.996
This is, this is bad,

12:00.030 --> 12:01.531
but it was an accident.

12:01.565 --> 12:03.133
We'll, we'll tell Chase we're sorry.

12:03.167 --> 12:04.734
And that we lied about the car accident.

12:04.769 --> 12:06.019
What?!

12:06.053 --> 12:07.170
No. No-no-no-no-no-no.

12:07.204 --> 12:08.471
We're, we're in too deep now.

12:08.506 --> 12:09.739
We have to stick to our story.

12:09.774 --> 12:12.542
Oh, this is horrible.
It's horrible!

12:12.576 --> 12:14.911
We barbecued that poor man's house.

12:14.945 --> 12:15.929
Wait, who's this "we"?

12:15.963 --> 12:17.897
I was locking Gene in the garden shed

12:17.932 --> 12:19.566
when Tina was playing Firestarter.

12:19.600 --> 12:22.035
I burrowed out like a little mole!

12:22.069 --> 12:25.238
Louise is right. I'm a firestarter and a jinx.
Yep.

12:25.272 --> 12:26.756
And I'm going to destroy this family.

12:26.791 --> 12:27.991
You're the reason I'm fat!

12:28.025 --> 12:29.926
I know.
Oh, my God, Chase.

12:29.960 --> 12:31.511
I, I don't know what to say.

12:31.545 --> 12:33.480
We're, we're so sorry.

12:35.483 --> 12:38.184
Bob, it's okay.

12:38.219 --> 12:40.336
This was still a
better-than-average party for me.

12:40.371 --> 12:42.338
Really? But your,
but your house.

12:42.373 --> 12:44.607
Your-Your really nice
house is gone!

12:44.642 --> 12:47.577
Well, this might surprise you.
I have insurance!

12:52.383 --> 12:55.752
Yeah, I lost a lifetime of
memories and my cat Spritzal.

12:55.786 --> 12:56.853
I killed your cat?!

12:56.887 --> 12:58.354
Well, no, Spritzal died

12:58.389 --> 12:59.522
last week. Natural causes.

12:59.557 --> 13:02.091
She's, uh, she's peeing
in God's shoes now.

13:02.126 --> 13:03.193
Too soon!

13:03.227 --> 13:04.561
But her ashes were in there.

13:04.595 --> 13:05.795
Well, technically, they still are,

13:05.830 --> 13:06.963
aren't they, buddy?

13:06.997 --> 13:08.698
Look, you all go home

13:08.732 --> 13:10.767
and just forget about this, okay?

13:10.801 --> 13:13.453
I'm just so grateful
that no one got hurt.

13:13.487 --> 13:14.754
Ow.
Coming through!

13:16.590 --> 13:18.892
I'm a firestarter and a jinx.

13:18.926 --> 13:21.411
And I'm going to destroy this family.

13:21.445 --> 13:24.481
We're in too deep now!
We have to stick to our story!

13:26.867 --> 13:28.485
Huh?! Wha...?!

13:29.787 --> 13:31.554
Screaming!

13:31.589 --> 13:33.490
Wha...? Wha...?
Gene!

13:33.524 --> 13:34.741
What the heck is going on?

13:34.775 --> 13:36.142
My stomach is in knots.

13:36.160 --> 13:37.911
Did you eat rope again?

13:37.945 --> 13:39.913
Tina, sweetie, is this about the fire?

13:39.947 --> 13:41.247
Because houses can be rebuilt.

13:41.282 --> 13:42.782
No one was in it, honey.

13:42.816 --> 13:44.584
But my conscience is still on fire.

13:44.618 --> 13:47.954
Okay, enough. I, I can't stand
to see Tina like this.

13:47.988 --> 13:50.273
Listen, I lied
about who was driving our car

13:50.307 --> 13:52.175
during the accident.
Huh?!

13:52.209 --> 13:54.611
I let Tina drive a little
in the parking lot.

13:54.645 --> 13:56.946
No fair!
Mort doesn't let us drive!

13:56.981 --> 13:59.482
And then I made everything
worse by lying about it.

13:59.517 --> 14:00.950
Why didn't you tell me?

14:00.985 --> 14:02.352
Because you're terrible
at keeping secrets.

14:02.386 --> 14:03.953
You just blurt everything out.

14:03.988 --> 14:07.257
Sorry we're late!
Bob had diarrhea!

14:07.291 --> 14:08.625
â™ª Running down the gutter

14:08.659 --> 14:09.926
â™ª With the piece of bread
and butter, diarrhea. â™ª

14:09.960 --> 14:11.160
Lin!

14:11.195 --> 14:12.662
I love you, Mom.

14:12.696 --> 14:14.497
Anyway, I shouldn't have
kept this from you.

14:14.532 --> 14:15.798
I was wrong.

14:15.833 --> 14:17.033
Stop it.

14:17.067 --> 14:18.768
I'm going down to Chase's office

14:18.802 --> 14:20.470
first thing in the morning
to come clean.

14:20.504 --> 14:21.604
I'm going with you.

14:21.639 --> 14:23.673
Yes! Good.
We'll tell some truth!

14:25.175 --> 14:27.143
"Hey, while your car's in the shop,

14:27.177 --> 14:29.445
I can drive you guys around."

14:29.480 --> 14:31.648
Why did I say that?
What's wrong with me?

14:32.566 --> 14:33.700
Oh, hey, guys!

14:33.734 --> 14:35.301
What can I do for you?

14:35.336 --> 14:36.369
Hi, Chase.

14:36.403 --> 14:38.538
Uh, I have something I need to tell you.

14:38.572 --> 14:41.074
Is it about my dead fish?
'Cause I already know.

14:41.108 --> 14:45.028
I wasn't driving when I had
the car accident. Tina was.

14:45.062 --> 14:47.230
It's true. I was.

14:47.264 --> 14:48.064
I knew that.

14:48.098 --> 14:48.898
You knew?
You knew?

14:48.933 --> 14:50.366
What, you thought you were

14:50.401 --> 14:51.701
fooling me with that cockamamie story

14:51.735 --> 14:53.069
about a butterfly and a bird?

14:53.103 --> 14:53.903
A cormorant.

14:53.938 --> 14:55.855
Whatever.
Of course I knew!

14:55.889 --> 14:58.424
I figured if I scratched
your back, you'd scratch mine.

14:58.459 --> 15:00.693
Wait. I-I don't want
to scratch your back.

15:00.728 --> 15:02.028
You already did.

15:03.530 --> 15:06.165
Tina's "accidental" fire?
No accident.

15:06.200 --> 15:07.734
It was an accident, I swear!

15:07.768 --> 15:09.035
What are you talking about?

15:09.069 --> 15:10.870
We're all in on this, compadres!

15:10.904 --> 15:13.339
I looked the other way
on your fender-bender.

15:13.374 --> 15:16.109
You gave me a convenient cover
to burn down my house.

15:16.143 --> 15:17.844
Why would you burn down your own house?

15:17.878 --> 15:20.179
'Cause I'm covered for twice
what it's worth.

15:20.214 --> 15:21.914
And no one is gonna question my claim

15:21.949 --> 15:23.950
when little Tina
was left in charge of the grill.

15:23.984 --> 15:25.952
How did you know
I was going to start a fire?

15:25.986 --> 15:27.720
Well, you didn't.

15:27.755 --> 15:30.089
My good buddy
odorless kerosene did. Ugh!

15:30.124 --> 15:31.357
So I'm not a jinx.

15:31.392 --> 15:32.692
I, I can't believe what you're saying.

15:32.726 --> 15:35.228
Well, believe this.
It's your cut!

15:35.262 --> 15:36.362
My cut?

15:36.397 --> 15:37.680
I'm... I'm not taking
your money.

15:37.715 --> 15:39.215
Oh, think about it, you two.

15:39.249 --> 15:41.951
We'll be the three amigos
of insurance fraud.

15:41.986 --> 15:44.287
Restaurants are disaster magnets!

15:44.321 --> 15:46.456
Broken pipes,
slip-and-falls, her.

15:46.490 --> 15:47.707
Aw...
Hey.

15:47.741 --> 15:49.475
I make sure you get the maximum payout,

15:49.510 --> 15:51.144
minus a small percent, of course.

15:51.178 --> 15:53.246
Hey, we're not gonna commit
insurance fraud.

15:53.280 --> 15:55.448
Yeah, that doesn't sound
like something you'd do.

15:55.466 --> 15:57.433
Oh, wait, you already did!

15:57.468 --> 15:59.202
Your daddy could go to jail!

15:59.236 --> 16:00.453
Huh?! Huh! Huh!

16:00.487 --> 16:02.088
Chase, you can't be serious...

16:02.122 --> 16:03.606
Huh! Huh!
Serious as a judge.

16:03.641 --> 16:06.592
Judges, by the way, are most
interested in the testimony

16:06.626 --> 16:10.296
of the insurance adjuster.
And I will testify against you.

16:10.331 --> 16:12.231
Oh, I got it!
You'll flood your basement!

16:12.266 --> 16:14.000
Why are you doing this to us?

16:14.034 --> 16:15.468
Because you're my golden goose.

16:15.502 --> 16:17.170
And I'm not letting you get away.

16:17.204 --> 16:19.339
You are the worst insurance adjuster.

16:19.373 --> 16:22.091
But the world's greatest uncle.

16:23.694 --> 16:24.894
So, Chase is blackmailing us.

16:24.928 --> 16:26.946
And if we don't go along with his scam

16:26.980 --> 16:28.998
and flood the basement,
he's gonna turn me in.

16:29.033 --> 16:30.316
Flood the basement?

16:30.334 --> 16:31.801
But my collage supplies!

16:31.835 --> 16:33.236
They're just magazines, Mom.

16:33.270 --> 16:36.822
They are '90s Cosmopolitans
from the '90s.

16:36.840 --> 16:38.491
Lin, let's focus on the blackmailing.

16:38.509 --> 16:41.444
Huh! Huh! We gotta take
that son of a bitch down!

16:41.478 --> 16:42.595
Language.

16:42.629 --> 16:43.629
Sorry, Mom.
Tina's right.

16:43.663 --> 16:45.298
We need to come up with an idea

16:45.332 --> 16:47.450
to get us out of this.
Huh! Huh! Huh!

16:47.484 --> 16:49.585
Tina, stop doing that.
It's disturbing and scary.

16:49.620 --> 16:50.953
Wait. That's it!

16:50.988 --> 16:52.021
What is?

16:52.056 --> 16:53.790
What if we scare Chase so bad

16:53.824 --> 16:55.358
he'll never want to see us again?

16:55.392 --> 16:56.759
Hmm. That could work.

16:56.794 --> 16:57.927
Scare him? How?

16:57.961 --> 16:59.421
Boo!
Ah!

17:02.912 --> 17:04.079
Good morning, Bob!

17:04.113 --> 17:05.981
Or should I call you "Rob"

17:06.015 --> 17:07.638
since we're gonna be
stealing money together?

17:07.759 --> 17:09.660
I'm sorry. It was
too good to resist.

17:09.694 --> 17:11.248
Yeah, that was hilarious.

17:11.367 --> 17:13.502
Uh, so anyway, my basement flooded.

17:13.537 --> 17:15.238
Luckily, we're covered.

17:15.271 --> 17:17.607
Uh, Bob, will you send the kids up?

17:17.641 --> 17:20.108
Their breakfast is getting cold.
They aren't down here.

17:20.144 --> 17:22.444
What are you talking about?
Of course they are.

17:22.479 --> 17:23.980
They were playing down in the basement.

17:24.013 --> 17:25.448
The basement?!

17:25.482 --> 17:27.383
Bobby, what's the matter?

17:29.286 --> 17:30.486
My babies!

17:30.521 --> 17:32.989
No...!
Agh! Agh!

17:34.675 --> 17:37.944
Oh, my God, no...!

17:37.978 --> 17:40.413
I went too far!
What have I done?!

17:40.447 --> 17:44.184
My kids...!
My children are dead!

17:44.218 --> 17:46.920
Bobby, why?!

17:46.954 --> 17:49.022
Bob, I can't handle this!
I never saw this...

17:49.056 --> 17:50.790
Okay, I'm leaving!
I'm sorry!

17:50.824 --> 17:52.926
You'll never hear from me again!

17:52.960 --> 17:54.994
And... scene.
Eh?

17:55.029 --> 17:57.163
Great performances by
all three of us, huh?

17:57.198 --> 17:58.665
Oh. You figured it out.

17:58.699 --> 17:59.966
Come on. You didn't
really expect me

18:00.000 --> 18:01.434
to buy that, did you, Bob?

18:01.468 --> 18:02.869
Uh, sorta. Yes.

18:02.903 --> 18:04.704
Your acting is terrible.
You closed the door.

18:04.738 --> 18:06.606
You didn't even try
to resuscitate your kids!

18:06.640 --> 18:09.309
Yeah, It turns out the kids can't
hold their breath that long.

18:09.343 --> 18:12.011
And we were gonna give 'em
snorkels, but, uh...

18:12.046 --> 18:13.046
Snorkels.

18:13.080 --> 18:14.881
Yeah, uh, you know what?
Never mind.

18:14.915 --> 18:15.882
Snorkel.

18:15.916 --> 18:19.002
Kids, come upstairs.

18:19.036 --> 18:20.703
Now let's get this paperwork started!

18:20.721 --> 18:23.039
Get this claim processed!

18:23.073 --> 18:25.642
And remember, this stays
just between us.

18:25.676 --> 18:27.710
No one can ever know.

18:27.745 --> 18:29.545
Bob, Lin, oh, good.
You're, you're both here.

18:29.580 --> 18:31.581
Listen, I, I got
something stuck in my craw.

18:31.615 --> 18:33.049
Not a good time, Mort.

18:33.083 --> 18:36.402
Uh, you know, it's never
a good time for these things.

18:36.437 --> 18:37.370
You're my neighbors and I love you,

18:37.404 --> 18:39.055
and I, I love your kids.

18:39.089 --> 18:42.025
I mean, up to a point
But I'm not a taxi, okay?!

18:42.059 --> 18:43.159
All right. Sorry,

18:43.193 --> 18:44.761
That came out wrong.
A little over the top.

18:44.795 --> 18:45.929
Let me, let me start over.

18:45.963 --> 18:47.664
Look, we're getting
our car back tomorrow.

18:47.698 --> 18:50.033
So we don't need any more rides, Mort.

18:50.067 --> 18:51.234
Yeah, we left you a note

18:51.268 --> 18:53.336
and a thank-you package
on your doorstep.

18:53.370 --> 18:56.606
Oh, so you did. Okay.

18:56.640 --> 18:59.676
Well, I mean, that wasn't necessary.

18:59.710 --> 19:02.912
What a lovely surprise.
All right, I'm gonna go now.

19:02.947 --> 19:05.748
Okay, Chase.
You, you caught us.

19:05.783 --> 19:07.583
But you're playing with fire...
Fire.

19:07.618 --> 19:09.018
...and water, literally.

19:09.053 --> 19:10.920
And eventually, somebody
is going to get hurt.

19:10.955 --> 19:12.255
Gene, stop it!

19:12.289 --> 19:13.239
Ah!

19:13.274 --> 19:14.440
Don't insult me, Bob.

19:14.475 --> 19:16.258
You're new to this.
I'm the pro.

19:16.277 --> 19:17.610
I've pulled hundreds of scams,

19:17.645 --> 19:19.562
and I'm gonna pull hundreds more.

19:19.596 --> 19:23.182
Now for our next fraud,
I'm thinking lightning.

19:23.217 --> 19:25.034
A big surge could mess up

19:25.069 --> 19:27.887
all these incredibly expensive
appliances. Am I nuts?

19:27.921 --> 19:30.590
Yes.
Well, off to process this flood claim.

19:30.624 --> 19:32.425
Talk soon, partner!

19:32.459 --> 19:34.627
Oh, my God.
We're stuck with this guy forever.

19:34.662 --> 19:37.063
Like me and this piece
of corn in my teeth.

19:37.097 --> 19:38.965
Right, corn?
Are we?

19:38.999 --> 19:40.700
I've pulled hundreds of scams,

19:40.734 --> 19:42.435
and I'm gonna pull hundreds more.

19:42.469 --> 19:44.203
Ha! Tina,
that's brilliant!

19:44.238 --> 19:46.472
Oh, sure, when she does it,
it's brilliant.

19:46.507 --> 19:48.775
That scammer is going to the slammer!

19:48.809 --> 19:50.076
Buh-bye, baby!

19:50.110 --> 19:51.611
Tina, do you realize what this means?

19:51.645 --> 19:53.046
You saved the family.

19:53.080 --> 19:55.598
I guess it's all part
of learning to drive.

20:09.179 --> 20:13.649
For our next fraud,
I'm thinking lightning!

20:16.603 --> 20:18.121
Hey! Hey, Bob!
Bob, look!

20:21.375 --> 20:22.475
That's you.

20:23.777 --> 20:25.628
Well, I'm glad this week is behind us.

20:25.662 --> 20:27.430
This was the worst week of my life.

20:27.464 --> 20:28.765
But I'm better for it.

20:28.799 --> 20:31.017
This was the worst week
of your life, Tina?

20:31.051 --> 20:33.653
You got to crash a car
and burn down a house!

20:33.687 --> 20:35.321
I got to do nothing!

20:35.356 --> 20:37.690
Fine. Here, Louise,
you can break this plate.

20:37.725 --> 20:38.341
Ah!

20:38.375 --> 20:39.776
No fair!
I want one!

20:39.810 --> 20:41.094
Yeah!

20:41.128 --> 20:42.862
That felt good.
I want another one!

20:42.896 --> 20:44.180
No, that's it.

20:44.214 --> 20:45.765
Here, give me one!
Stop!

20:45.799 --> 20:46.799
Lin, what are you doing?

20:46.834 --> 20:48.668
What? They're...
I hate these plates.

20:48.702 --> 20:50.136
Stop breaking plates! Lin!

20:50.170 --> 20:51.371
Ah!

20:51.405 --> 20:52.742
- Ah-ha-ha, it's fun.
- Smash!

20:52.862 --> 20:55.751
- Watch me break this plate
and the window! - No!
