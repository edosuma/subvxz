WEBVTT

00:06.047 --> 00:09.926
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:10.969 --> 00:12.804
WE KNOW WHAT YOU DID, YOU'RE SCREWED

00:14.305 --> 00:17.308
I'm sick of being lumped in with you guys.

00:18.268 --> 00:19.477
It's The Lodge.

00:19.561 --> 00:20.979
-The what?
-Just what we needed.

00:21.062 --> 00:22.564
But what is it?

00:22.647 --> 00:25.275
A secret organization
that existed years ago

00:25.358 --> 00:28.028
to ruin the lives
of kids with scholarships in EWS.

00:29.988 --> 00:32.157
This is too much. Right?

00:32.240 --> 00:34.409
No, it's not too much. It's bullshit.

00:34.492 --> 00:36.453
I know, but I don't make the rules.

00:36.536 --> 00:37.537
But your mom did.

00:37.620 --> 00:38.496
No, Luka.

00:39.039 --> 00:40.457
What about your mom?

00:42.417 --> 00:43.418
Nothing.

00:44.627 --> 00:47.213
She was involved years ago,
but not anymore.

00:47.297 --> 00:48.965
No, tell the whole story.

00:49.049 --> 00:50.759
Jana's mom was a member.

00:50.842 --> 00:53.762
That was a long time ago, and she left.

00:53.845 --> 00:56.056
The Lodge hasn't existed in years, so…

00:56.139 --> 00:59.559
Look, instead of fighting,
let's figure out a solution.

01:00.143 --> 01:02.312
I don't know. Let's talk to Celina.

01:02.395 --> 01:04.064
She'll tell our parents.

01:04.147 --> 01:06.858
If my folks find out
that they burn down classrooms here,

01:06.941 --> 01:08.777
they'll make me come home, okay?

01:09.277 --> 01:11.905
All they have are flashlights and masks.

01:11.988 --> 01:13.573
They can't do anything.

01:13.656 --> 01:14.783
So we should stand down?

01:14.866 --> 01:16.367
I don't want any trouble.

01:16.451 --> 01:17.744
None of us do.

01:18.328 --> 01:20.705
But we have to put a stop to this.

01:20.789 --> 01:23.666
Right, you're a pop star by day
and a vigilante by night.

01:25.710 --> 01:28.254
They're just bullies who want to scare us.

01:29.214 --> 01:30.548
We can't fall for it.

01:30.632 --> 01:31.800
What if they want more?

01:33.927 --> 01:36.221
-What was that?
-The power's out.

01:36.304 --> 01:38.556
"What was that?" What else would it be?

01:39.057 --> 01:41.643
This is ridiculous. Take this.

01:45.605 --> 01:47.690
So? What do we do?

01:47.774 --> 01:49.359
YOU DESERVE BETTER FRIENDS

01:49.442 --> 01:50.360
Why don't we vote?

01:51.236 --> 01:52.153
Okay.

01:52.237 --> 01:55.073
All in favor of not causing a mess

01:55.156 --> 01:57.617
and having a nice first year?

02:01.371 --> 02:03.706
Great. Four against one.

02:03.790 --> 02:05.458
So it's settled.

02:05.542 --> 02:07.001
If majority says so.

02:09.587 --> 02:10.421
Light!

02:20.473 --> 02:23.434
HIDDEN NUMBER
FOLLOW ME - LINK

02:27.939 --> 02:29.023
No way.

02:33.570 --> 02:37.198
WE'RE WATCHING YOU

02:57.177 --> 02:59.470
How are rehearsals without me?

02:59.554 --> 03:01.055
-Do you miss me?
-Shut up.

03:01.639 --> 03:03.433
What? It's nothing.

03:04.142 --> 03:05.101
What?

03:13.109 --> 03:16.946
Congratulations. You're now part
of the Musical Excellence Program.

03:17.030 --> 03:20.909
That means you can participate
in the Battle of the Bands.

03:23.578 --> 03:27.457
Emphasis on band.
So if you don't have friends, make some.

03:27.540 --> 03:29.250
-You were right.
-About what?

03:29.834 --> 03:32.337
My future ex-boyfriend
is an egomaniac psycho

03:32.420 --> 03:33.963
with an ankle injury.

03:36.174 --> 03:37.133
I knew it.

03:37.217 --> 03:40.970
As I'm sure you know,
previous winners now have gold records,

03:41.054 --> 03:42.931
they've gone on world tours…

03:43.014 --> 03:44.933
Why haven't you dumped him?

03:45.683 --> 03:47.227
Keep your friends close,

03:47.727 --> 03:49.687
and your enemies closer.

03:50.355 --> 03:53.441
Winning the Battle of the Bands
guarantees a career…

03:53.524 --> 03:54.943
I'm going to play dumb.

03:55.735 --> 03:59.155
That way we can find
the proof we need to unmask him.

03:59.239 --> 04:03.868
Starting with quarter finals,
then semi-finals…

04:03.952 --> 04:06.204
-Did you tell Esteban?
-No.

04:06.287 --> 04:07.455
…will go to the finale.

04:07.538 --> 04:09.624
It's better if only you know.

04:09.707 --> 04:11.918
On a more solemn note,

04:12.001 --> 04:16.089
we've opened an official investigation
of the hazing incident.

04:16.172 --> 04:18.549
This is your last chance to come forward.

04:19.133 --> 04:22.512
Once that door is closed,
there's no going back.

04:22.595 --> 04:25.723
The culprits will be expelled immediately.

04:26.224 --> 04:27.058
End of story.

04:28.393 --> 04:29.477
He's going down.

04:40.280 --> 04:43.241
Okay, students. I won't say this again.

04:43.324 --> 04:44.450
Get in a line.

04:44.534 --> 04:46.536
Don't stand around talking.

04:46.619 --> 04:49.080
Let's go. Pipe down.

04:49.163 --> 04:50.331
Thanks, babe.

04:50.415 --> 04:51.708
Single file.

04:53.126 --> 04:55.086
<i>When the sun shines down</i>

04:55.670 --> 04:58.214
<i>Here on the beach</i>

05:00.425 --> 05:06.472
<i>I feel your body pulsing</i>
<i>Next to me</i>

05:11.602 --> 05:15.481
<i>In your eyes, I feel infinite</i>

05:15.565 --> 05:18.860
<i>Stars rain down</i>

05:18.943 --> 05:20.153
<i>Mama</i>

05:21.487 --> 05:22.905
<i>One, two three, go!</i>

05:22.989 --> 05:23.823
<i>Death</i>

05:24.407 --> 05:25.491
<i>Destruction</i>

05:25.575 --> 05:27.535
<i>Why can't I think of anything else?</i>

05:28.161 --> 05:30.163
<i>Death! Destruction!</i>

05:38.087 --> 05:39.339
EMILIA AND THE DRYADS

05:41.507 --> 05:42.925
For God's sake!

05:44.719 --> 05:46.387
Hey! My pen.

05:46.471 --> 05:47.764
She took my pen.

05:51.434 --> 05:52.435
I kind of knew.

05:53.436 --> 05:54.437
Then trust me.

05:54.520 --> 05:55.480
Hi.

05:55.563 --> 05:56.939
Wanna form a band?

05:57.940 --> 05:59.609
I already have one.

06:01.027 --> 06:03.279
Well, you have two backup singers.

06:03.363 --> 06:04.572
That's not a band.

06:04.655 --> 06:08.493
You know, your voice would sound great
with the right instrumentals.

06:08.576 --> 06:12.246
Not that it isn't great,
but it would stand out more if…

06:12.330 --> 06:14.665
Look, you're very cute.

06:14.749 --> 06:16.042
And weird.

06:16.125 --> 06:19.170
And this is very cute and weird.

06:19.253 --> 06:22.256
So, don't take this personally,
but I'm here to win.

06:22.340 --> 06:25.134
And this origami won't help me win.

06:27.637 --> 06:30.890
Are you saying I'm not good enough to win?

06:30.973 --> 06:33.017
You're good, but maybe not enough.

06:33.101 --> 06:35.436
Plus, no freshman has ever won.

06:35.520 --> 06:39.273
This is my last year
and my last chance. I can't risk…

06:40.566 --> 06:41.484
Hello?

06:55.248 --> 06:57.333
-Ready? Let's go.
-Sure.

06:57.417 --> 06:58.459
Thanks.

07:00.378 --> 07:01.629
Mr. Vásquez.

07:02.463 --> 07:05.091
I need you to be 100% honest.

07:06.300 --> 07:08.136
Please, come in. Take a seat.

07:11.681 --> 07:12.807
First, let's start…

07:16.185 --> 07:17.395
Did you get turned down?

07:18.354 --> 07:20.815
Well, she said,

07:21.357 --> 07:23.776
"No freshman has ever won."

07:24.735 --> 07:25.862
Come on.

07:25.945 --> 07:29.866
Well, I know I'm not
a beautiful Brazilian girl,

07:29.949 --> 07:32.285
and you're not in love with me and stuff,

07:32.368 --> 07:35.121
but what if we made a band?

07:35.204 --> 07:36.581
Me and you?

07:36.664 --> 07:38.833
A drummer and a pianist?

07:39.417 --> 07:40.543
And a vocalist.

07:41.294 --> 07:42.128
Look.

07:43.004 --> 07:44.922
Room 206.

07:45.465 --> 07:46.340
A pianist,

07:46.424 --> 07:48.676
a drummer, and Jana Cohen Gandía.

07:48.759 --> 07:49.677
Sounds good, right?

07:49.760 --> 07:50.845
Yeah.

07:51.345 --> 07:53.389
If Jana's in, so am I.

07:53.473 --> 07:54.307
But,

07:55.099 --> 07:57.310
I think she's playing with her boyfriend.

07:57.393 --> 07:59.937
Well, we have to try, right?

08:00.521 --> 08:04.358
Remember,
success is 50% vision, 50% effort.

08:04.942 --> 08:05.943
Is that right?

08:06.736 --> 08:08.738
Who said that? Jesus Christ?

08:09.405 --> 08:10.948
No. Bad Bunny.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.368
-Okay.
-Duh!

08:15.328 --> 08:17.538
-I've been thinking.
-About what?

08:18.706 --> 08:22.293
We should play the song
I dedicated to you for the first round.

08:23.044 --> 08:26.422
The one you sang on my birthday
riding your dad's horse?

08:26.506 --> 08:27.340
Yes.

08:27.840 --> 08:30.009
Sebas, singing "Mátalas" would be cringey.

08:31.761 --> 08:32.595
Well,

08:33.137 --> 08:36.349
it doesn't matter what we sing
if it's from the heart.

08:40.228 --> 08:41.395
Trust me.

08:43.814 --> 08:44.982
Trust in us.

08:54.825 --> 08:56.786
What are you doing? Focus.

08:58.120 --> 08:59.080
-Hey.
-Hi.

09:01.207 --> 09:03.000
-What's this?
-Our band.

09:03.084 --> 09:05.962
The girls from room 206? All of you?

09:06.045 --> 09:07.880
Well, that's the plan.

09:09.131 --> 09:11.717
I thought Jana was singing
with her boyfriend.

09:11.801 --> 09:13.427
Well, if that's the case,

09:13.511 --> 09:16.597
it would be two thirds of room 206?

09:19.433 --> 09:20.935
Who are you playing with?

09:26.566 --> 09:29.735
I think you should play
with someone you like, right?

09:30.403 --> 09:35.283
You know, long rehearsals and… all that.

09:36.367 --> 09:38.995
Yeah. Actually, I think you're right.

09:39.078 --> 09:41.706
<i>Hey, hey, hey, G</i>

09:41.789 --> 09:43.207
<i>I'm in my territory</i>

09:43.291 --> 09:45.793
<i>Like Paul the Apostle</i>
<i>I'm giving testimony</i>

09:45.876 --> 09:47.753
<i>I spit a couple bars</i>
<i>And drive you crazy</i>

09:47.837 --> 09:52.133
<i>Listen up, give me cash money</i>
<i>The world could end, I…</i>

09:52.216 --> 09:53.259
What, bro?

09:55.011 --> 09:57.972
We should play
in the Battle of the Bands together.

10:02.143 --> 10:03.936
You're a goddamn genius, bro.

10:04.020 --> 10:05.396
-Are you in?
-We'll kill it.

10:05.479 --> 10:06.981
Hell yeah.

10:07.690 --> 10:09.650
Actually, I was thinking

10:10.151 --> 10:11.485
we could do something…

10:11.569 --> 10:13.654
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.

10:15.698 --> 10:18.993
We could do what the girls did.
They teamed up as roomies.

10:19.076 --> 10:21.704
We could do the same. You, me,

10:23.080 --> 10:24.165
and Luka.

10:25.541 --> 10:26.459
And Luka?

10:29.337 --> 10:30.171
Really, Luka?

10:30.671 --> 10:33.424
I mean, you must be joking, bro.

10:34.258 --> 10:35.092
No.

10:52.818 --> 10:55.738
<i>You look at me differently</i>

10:55.821 --> 11:00.076
<i>You hug me</i>
<i>And I don't feel your warmth</i>

11:05.414 --> 11:07.917
<i>I say what I feel</i>

11:08.417 --> 11:12.630
<i>You interrupt me and finish my sentence</i>

11:13.130 --> 11:15.508
<i>You're always right</i>

11:15.591 --> 11:18.094
DO YOU WANT TO BE PART OF IT?
LUKA'S BAND AUDITIONS

11:18.177 --> 11:20.680
<i>You</i>

11:21.180 --> 11:24.392
<i>The same old story</i>
<i>So predictable</i>

11:24.475 --> 11:29.772
<i>I already know it by heart</i>

11:29.855 --> 11:36.237
<i>So run, run, run away</i>
<i>My love</i>

11:36.821 --> 11:41.367
<i>You were always faster than me</i>…

11:43.369 --> 11:45.079
You and Pablito Escobar?

11:46.122 --> 11:47.665
Why would I be interested?

11:47.748 --> 11:51.335
If you didn't know,
you need a band to audition.

11:51.419 --> 11:54.505
<i>I'll never give you my tears</i>

11:55.089 --> 12:01.137
<i>So run away like you do</i>
<i>Don't look back</i>

12:01.637 --> 12:03.097
<i>You've done it before</i>

12:03.180 --> 12:04.557
<i>And honestly</i>

12:04.640 --> 12:06.058
<i>I don't care</i>

12:06.142 --> 12:07.143
Wait.

12:07.226 --> 12:08.310
What's wrong?

12:08.394 --> 12:09.895
I need the bathroom.

12:10.730 --> 12:11.814
Okay.

12:20.072 --> 12:22.116
Jana! I have an offer for you.

12:22.199 --> 12:24.452
Actually, it's more like a vision.

12:25.119 --> 12:26.203
Let's form a band.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.789
You, me, and Andi.

12:29.540 --> 12:31.876
That's ridiculous.
Do I look like I'm on a scholarship?

12:36.505 --> 12:38.799
Room 206!

12:38.883 --> 12:40.760
Girl, I'd love to,

12:40.843 --> 12:42.887
but I already told Sebas
I'd play with him.

12:44.013 --> 12:48.058
But I'm sure you can find another singer,
one better than me.

12:49.643 --> 12:52.813
Dixon and I are better than most.

12:52.897 --> 12:53.731
You are too.

12:53.814 --> 12:57.902
So, if you want a real shot
at beating Sebas and Jana,

12:57.985 --> 12:59.111
think about it.

13:02.281 --> 13:03.282
MJ.

13:04.700 --> 13:06.202
-We're good, right?
-Of course.

13:19.298 --> 13:24.428
BAND - MEMBERS

13:38.484 --> 13:40.861
Dude, signing up without a singer

13:42.404 --> 13:43.864
seems like a bad idea.

13:44.865 --> 13:46.492
Should we not sign up, then?

13:47.076 --> 13:48.744
Not unless you want to lose.

13:52.456 --> 13:54.667
I really wanted to win this thing,

13:56.335 --> 13:59.338
but I guess we can always try next year.

13:59.839 --> 14:03.300
Okay. What if we had someone who sings,

14:03.384 --> 14:07.263
who's brilliant, and super talented?

14:08.055 --> 14:09.056
And gorgeous.

14:11.892 --> 14:12.726
No.

14:20.734 --> 14:22.778
Don't think of it as an assignment,

14:22.862 --> 14:24.905
but as an opportunity.

14:25.406 --> 14:28.284
We're here to learn
about the greatest thing ever.

14:28.367 --> 14:29.285
Music.

14:29.368 --> 14:31.412
-Excuse me, can I come in?
-Yes, come in.

14:32.663 --> 14:33.622
Yes?

14:33.706 --> 14:37.167
The rules say that ten minutes late
counts as an absence.

14:37.251 --> 14:39.420
Yes, but we can make an exception

14:39.503 --> 14:41.881
for this young man with a special talent.

14:41.964 --> 14:43.257
Being a rural boy?

14:43.841 --> 14:45.259
No, he's from the inland.

14:45.342 --> 14:47.803
No, he has an incredible ear,

14:47.887 --> 14:49.471
it's an exceptional talent.

14:49.555 --> 14:52.391
Since when do they let freshmen
take this class?

14:52.474 --> 14:55.019
If they look like that, it's fine by me.

14:55.102 --> 14:58.772
You're going to do
an original composition on your passion.

14:58.856 --> 15:00.858
Forget about technique for now.

15:00.941 --> 15:02.401
You dodged a bullet, Sebas.

15:11.201 --> 15:13.412
Why the long face?

15:14.747 --> 15:16.165
Tell me something, Selena.

15:16.248 --> 15:17.541
Are you talking to me?

15:17.625 --> 15:19.043
Yes, I'm talking to you.

15:19.126 --> 15:21.629
Why are all the girls going crazy for him?

15:21.712 --> 15:23.297
Who? Esteban?

15:24.381 --> 15:25.299
Is that his name?

15:25.382 --> 15:27.301
-Yeah, Esteban.
-Esteban.

15:27.384 --> 15:29.720
Look, I'll be honest with you for once.

15:32.139 --> 15:33.974
He's stupid not to notice you.

15:34.683 --> 15:38.979
No need to explain. I know Jana likes him.

15:39.063 --> 15:41.357
Yeah, but Jana has a boyfriend, right?

15:42.816 --> 15:44.401
So? She doesn't care.

15:44.985 --> 15:48.322
When she wants something, she gets it.

15:48.405 --> 15:49.990
Even if she doesn't deserve it.

15:50.074 --> 15:52.409
Well, no. Jana is really nice.

15:52.493 --> 15:55.788
She's talented, and pretty, and…

15:55.871 --> 15:57.122
Okay. Look at me.

15:58.374 --> 16:01.210
You're way prettier
and more talented than her.

16:01.710 --> 16:02.628
Way more.

16:05.089 --> 16:07.216
Why are you being nice to me?

16:09.802 --> 16:10.719
No, I don't.

16:10.803 --> 16:12.596
I can be nice, right?

16:12.680 --> 16:13.973
I'm not being nice.

16:14.056 --> 16:16.141
I'm just not being mean. It's different.

16:16.225 --> 16:17.935
I don't know what it is about you.

16:18.018 --> 16:22.022
I like you a little.
Maybe it's your potential.

16:22.106 --> 16:25.609
Just lose the religious Selena vibes.

16:25.693 --> 16:27.069
Please, just drop it.

16:27.653 --> 16:31.073
But if you want the boy from Puebla,
you should go for it.

16:31.699 --> 16:32.950
You just have to try.

16:42.209 --> 16:45.713
<i>I never thought…</i>

16:54.430 --> 16:55.931
I wish I had that.

16:56.015 --> 16:56.849
What?

16:57.766 --> 16:59.309
Your talent, bro.

16:59.393 --> 17:03.731
I wish I had a little piano in my head,

17:04.314 --> 17:05.816
or even a melody.

17:05.899 --> 17:07.860
I'm more rhythmic.

17:07.943 --> 17:09.987
I'm not as melodic as you.

17:11.071 --> 17:13.032
If I had your gift, I don't know.

17:13.115 --> 17:16.994
I could figure out people's PIN numbers

17:17.077 --> 17:19.329
just by listening
to the sound of the keypad.

17:19.830 --> 17:21.457
That's impossible, dude.

17:21.540 --> 17:24.501
I'm serious. Each key has a note, right?

17:24.585 --> 17:26.837
Could you be any more of a stereotype?

17:27.337 --> 17:28.756
A Colombian thief?

17:29.965 --> 17:30.966
What's next?

17:31.050 --> 17:32.509
Drug trafficking in school?

17:37.723 --> 17:38.724
Come on.

17:40.184 --> 17:41.477
Boy.

17:52.488 --> 17:54.698
So you didn't leave your room that night?

17:54.782 --> 17:56.075
No, miss.

17:56.158 --> 17:57.409
I was playing <i>Fortnite</i>.

17:57.493 --> 17:59.495
<i>Fortnite</i>? What's that?

18:00.537 --> 18:02.539
You were seen in the hallway
before the fire.

18:02.623 --> 18:04.583
I was getting a pill for my cramps.

18:04.666 --> 18:06.126
Do you have any proof?

18:06.210 --> 18:08.087
This photo I sent my ex.

18:08.170 --> 18:10.672
That's not necessary. Put it away.

18:11.423 --> 18:14.760
So why didn't anyone see you leave
when the fire started?

18:14.843 --> 18:16.720
-Where were you?
-Celina, I'm over 18.

18:16.804 --> 18:18.889
I'm a responsible adult.

18:18.972 --> 18:22.601
I had nothing to do with this.
I was leading the first-aid team.

18:23.852 --> 18:26.647
I know the seniors are involved in this.

18:27.314 --> 18:30.651
And I know that you know
everything that happens here.

18:30.734 --> 18:34.279
Why would they tell the mayor's son
they're planning a crime?

18:35.322 --> 18:36.865
Celina, this is serious.

18:37.616 --> 18:39.118
I'm worried too.

18:40.244 --> 18:42.830
Jana was there.
I'd die if anything happened to her.

18:58.512 --> 19:01.723
I'll say it again.
I don't want to join your band.

19:01.807 --> 19:05.561
Thanks, but I have other options.

19:05.644 --> 19:07.688
That's cool, but actually,

19:07.771 --> 19:09.982
do you have the literature study guide?

19:10.065 --> 19:11.483
I lost my copy.

19:11.567 --> 19:12.734
You have a computer?

19:14.027 --> 19:15.279
Isn't that nice?

19:15.904 --> 19:17.156
You're moving up.

19:18.991 --> 19:20.200
I'll send it to you.

19:30.544 --> 19:32.713
Hey, MJ. How are you doing with…

19:33.547 --> 19:35.716
Wow. Holy shit.

19:36.717 --> 19:38.051
I feel ridiculous.

19:38.135 --> 19:40.345
Yeah, ridiculously hot.

19:41.346 --> 19:43.015
Are you hitting on me?

19:43.098 --> 19:44.308
No, of course not.

19:44.391 --> 19:46.560
I don't flirt with my friends.

19:46.643 --> 19:48.228
Oh… I see.

19:49.188 --> 19:50.105
But,

19:50.814 --> 19:54.985
if you weren't my friend,
and I didn't know you fart in your sleep…

19:56.153 --> 19:57.988
-What are you talking about?
-I'd hit that.

19:58.071 --> 20:00.657
-I don't do that, Andi.
-Okay.

20:00.741 --> 20:02.701
Do you think Esteban will like it?

20:03.911 --> 20:07.873
I mean, so he'll join our band.

20:08.790 --> 20:09.833
Maybe.

20:09.917 --> 20:13.253
But only so he'll join our band. Okay?

20:13.337 --> 20:14.755
-That's it.
-That's it.

20:14.838 --> 20:16.506
-Just a band.
-A band.

20:16.590 --> 20:19.509
Why else would I be interested in Esteban?

20:19.593 --> 20:21.011
Right. Why else?

20:21.094 --> 20:21.929
Why?

20:22.638 --> 20:24.097
-Like, why?
-Yeah.

20:24.681 --> 20:25.515
I mean…

20:31.480 --> 20:33.774
Sir, should I take him back
to the freshman classroom?

20:34.274 --> 20:35.108
No.

20:38.737 --> 20:40.155
Relax, breathe.

20:40.239 --> 20:41.323
What inspires you?

20:41.823 --> 20:44.243
Think about that.
I know you can do better.

20:44.743 --> 20:45.661
Come on.

21:12.521 --> 21:15.732
<i>I heard you</i>

21:16.316 --> 21:20.195
<i>Leaving at the break of dawn</i>

21:20.779 --> 21:24.283
<i>I never thought</i>

21:24.950 --> 21:28.412
<i>I wouldn't see you again</i>

21:29.663 --> 21:35.210
<i>I've gotten used to not feeling</i>

21:35.294 --> 21:37.671
<i>Your breath</i>

21:38.338 --> 21:44.177
<i>I've gotten used to resisting</i>

21:44.928 --> 21:49.266
<i>And although you left out of the blue</i>

21:49.349 --> 21:53.603
<i>I know you miss me</i>
<i>You call for me in your mind</i>

21:53.687 --> 21:58.025
<i>Because I'm part of your story forever</i>

21:58.108 --> 22:02.404
<i>I know I'll be in your heart eternally</i>

22:02.487 --> 22:04.698
<i>I'll be there</i>

22:15.417 --> 22:19.087
<i>I'll wait for you</i>

22:19.838 --> 22:23.175
<i>Forever at the break of dawn</i>

22:24.009 --> 22:30.307
<i>Wanting you to come back</i>

22:47.491 --> 22:49.201
-What?
-Nothing, dude.

22:49.284 --> 22:50.786
-Are you crying?
-Shut up.

22:54.956 --> 22:55.874
Let go of me.

22:56.375 --> 22:57.501
What inspired you?

22:59.002 --> 22:59.878
Your girlfriend.

23:01.296 --> 23:03.715
Go back to where you came from.

23:03.799 --> 23:05.133
You don't belong here.

23:05.842 --> 23:07.761
You might fool Jana, but not me.

23:08.261 --> 23:10.347
You know a lot about that, right?

23:11.181 --> 23:12.557
I'm not going anywhere.

23:13.100 --> 23:16.853
Besides, I can't wait
for Jana to see who you really are.

23:17.854 --> 23:19.981
Don't you dare talk about her. Okay?

23:20.065 --> 23:20.899
What's this?

23:20.982 --> 23:23.735
I'm telling Esteban how good he was.

23:24.611 --> 23:25.987
All right, Sebas.

23:26.071 --> 23:27.280
Camaraderie is great.

23:47.217 --> 23:48.051
Coming!

23:49.511 --> 23:50.387
Hi.

23:55.058 --> 23:56.643
You look different.

23:56.726 --> 24:01.356
Yeah. I'm experimenting a bit.

24:01.440 --> 24:04.192
Not that you looked bad before,
but you look good.

24:08.029 --> 24:10.991
Remember how I said
Andi and I were forming a band?

24:11.074 --> 24:14.035
And Jana would be the singer?

24:14.119 --> 24:15.704
But she's with Sebas.

24:15.787 --> 24:16.663
Exactly.

24:17.622 --> 24:21.251
Well, we wanted to see if maybe you wanted

24:21.334 --> 24:23.670
to sing with me.

24:23.753 --> 24:26.298
With us. In the band?

24:26.381 --> 24:29.050
-Maybe?
-Sure. I just have to tell Dixon.

24:29.134 --> 24:30.677
-But I think so.
-Right, Dixon.

24:31.928 --> 24:32.971
Well,

24:33.472 --> 24:34.389
think about it.

24:34.473 --> 24:37.225
-We're in 206, by the way.
-Okay.

24:37.309 --> 24:40.187
To figure out our song list.

24:40.979 --> 24:42.689
We're running out of time.

24:44.733 --> 24:46.485
Yep, 206.

24:48.820 --> 24:51.406
THE NONAMES

24:53.492 --> 24:55.452
BATTLE OF THE BANDS

25:11.843 --> 25:12.677
Sebas…

25:13.178 --> 25:15.222
-What?
-You're all sweaty.

25:16.765 --> 25:18.183
Jana, I went to the gym.

25:18.266 --> 25:19.601
Why don't you shower?

25:23.647 --> 25:24.481
Okay.

25:25.190 --> 25:26.066
I'll be quick.

25:57.722 --> 26:00.141
Hey, love. Do you want to spend the night?

26:03.853 --> 26:04.813
What are you doing?

26:04.896 --> 26:06.565
What the hell are you doing?

26:07.107 --> 26:09.109
Jana, obviously that's not mine.

26:09.609 --> 26:10.819
Whose is it, then?

26:11.611 --> 26:14.990
-Did your friends leave it here?
-Were you going through my stuff?

26:15.073 --> 26:16.491
Are you cheating on me?

26:17.075 --> 26:18.868
You're checking my phone.

26:18.952 --> 26:21.538
-Why do you have--
-Jana, leave my stuff alone!

26:23.081 --> 26:24.499
Don't talk to me like that.

26:24.583 --> 26:26.626
Jana, get out of my room! Leave.

26:28.628 --> 26:29.671
Get out, Jana!

26:30.255 --> 26:32.424
You're crazy. You're beyond paranoid.

26:32.507 --> 26:34.718
All you do is think about yourself!

26:35.260 --> 26:36.177
-Me?
-Yes, you!

26:36.261 --> 26:38.138
-You're the liar!
-You know what?

26:38.221 --> 26:41.891
If you knew me, you'd know that I put
integrity and honesty over everything.

26:43.893 --> 26:45.854
That's it. We're done.

26:46.354 --> 26:47.314
Okay?

26:49.149 --> 26:49.983
You need help.

26:59.492 --> 27:01.036
<i>Oh, no, no</i>

27:01.786 --> 27:03.788
<i>Dixon, baby</i>

27:04.873 --> 27:05.832
<i>Okay</i>

27:07.542 --> 27:09.961
<i>Improvising old-style</i>

27:10.045 --> 27:13.506
<i>Hits like a black belt in Muay Thai</i>
<i>Nothing stops me, no</i>

27:13.590 --> 27:17.177
<i>From the front</i>
<i>I'm the president of rap</i>

27:17.260 --> 27:19.512
<i>Where are my people</i>
<i>With heart?</i>

27:19.596 --> 27:22.515
<i>I come from the land</i>
<i>Of hills and steeples</i>

27:22.599 --> 27:24.309
<i>More than enough dignity</i>

27:24.392 --> 27:28.563
<i>I don't charge for favors, no</i>

27:28.647 --> 27:30.649
<i>Yeah, Dixon, baby</i>

27:31.149 --> 27:32.067
<i>No, no, no, no</i>…

27:32.108 --> 27:32.942
Motherfucker!

27:33.026 --> 27:36.279
How did I spend months with that idiot?
I can't believe it.

27:36.363 --> 27:38.573
Oh, baby, I love you! Oh, "love." Stupid.

27:38.657 --> 27:39.616
Hey. What happened?

27:39.699 --> 27:41.660
I found a mask in his dresser.

27:41.743 --> 27:44.913
The prick kicked me out
before I could grab it. It was him.

27:46.790 --> 27:47.624
And then?

27:50.210 --> 27:51.044
Hmm?

27:53.129 --> 27:54.047
What do we do?

28:04.474 --> 28:07.435
It was me. I lit the candles,

28:07.936 --> 28:09.729
and I stole the old RBD uniforms.

28:10.230 --> 28:12.190
I know it wasn't just you, Kuri.

28:12.273 --> 28:14.401
If you tell me who else was with you,

28:14.484 --> 28:17.070
I might let you finish your last year.

28:17.570 --> 28:20.156
It's The Lodge, right?
They're pressuring you.

28:20.240 --> 28:21.074
Come on.

28:22.117 --> 28:23.868
-Chocolate?
-No.

28:23.952 --> 28:26.037
-There are different kinds.
-Ana.

28:28.998 --> 28:30.250
It was just me.

28:30.333 --> 28:31.543
No one helped.

28:31.626 --> 28:33.169
I did it because I wanted to.

28:33.253 --> 28:36.339
I know you're protecting someone
and I'm going to find them.

28:37.048 --> 28:40.468
For now, you leave me
no choice but to expel you.

29:01.698 --> 29:02.699
Change of plans.

29:40.320 --> 29:41.654
I have a proposition.

29:42.280 --> 29:44.616
Coming from you, I'm sure it's indecent.

29:47.827 --> 29:50.747
I think we should play together
in the Battle of the Bands.

29:53.333 --> 29:54.793
You're joking.

29:55.627 --> 29:57.796
No, I'm not.

29:58.713 --> 30:00.632
I also think we should get back together.

30:02.217 --> 30:06.054
I told you not to come crying to me
when your relationship failed.

30:06.554 --> 30:07.555
Told you so.

30:07.639 --> 30:10.433
Emilia, this is your last chance to win.

30:13.603 --> 30:15.104
Together, we're a force.

30:15.188 --> 30:17.273
Let's give the school what they want.

30:17.774 --> 30:19.901
Their king and queen together again.

30:19.984 --> 30:21.027
Look, babe.

30:21.110 --> 30:24.531
I might have needed you in the past,

30:24.614 --> 30:28.868
but it sounds more like you need me now.

30:31.663 --> 30:33.748
Let's say it's mutually beneficial.

30:40.964 --> 30:43.466
I can't believe they're back together.

30:43.550 --> 30:48.137
It's as if my parents got back together
after getting divorced.

30:49.305 --> 30:50.306
Wow.

30:50.390 --> 30:51.850
I don't understand them.

30:51.933 --> 30:52.892
So weird.

31:01.734 --> 31:03.862
The Battle of the Bands is over.

31:06.197 --> 31:08.449
Don't worry. We still have next year.

31:08.950 --> 31:12.203
Dude, we just lost without even trying.

31:15.248 --> 31:16.249
Not yet.

31:17.959 --> 31:19.627
Still looking for a singer?

31:20.712 --> 31:21.671
Yeah.

31:24.674 --> 31:27.343
We're going to be the best band.

32:00.126 --> 32:01.961
<i>Andi's got flow</i>
<i>She's that girl</i>

32:02.045 --> 32:04.964
<i>When she hits the drums</i>
<i>It's like she's from a different world</i>

32:05.048 --> 32:08.384
<i>With her drumsticks</i>
<i>She hits hard, so sick</i>

32:08.468 --> 32:09.844
<i>What's that?</i>
<i>Guess who</i>

32:09.928 --> 32:11.846
<i>Musical superhero, a rhythm so true</i>

32:11.930 --> 32:14.057
<i>He goes hard on piano</i>
<i>And he's also the voice</i>

32:14.140 --> 32:16.267
<i>Esteban, hit the keys</i>
<i>It's the only choice</i>

32:16.351 --> 32:20.229
<i>Look, I wasn't lying</i>
<i>The melody's tight</i>

32:20.313 --> 32:21.898
<i>Thank God, that's right</i>

32:21.981 --> 32:24.525
<i>Esteban on piano</i>
<i>Andi on drums, we're all right</i>

32:24.609 --> 32:26.402
<i>I can't believe what I just saw</i>

32:26.486 --> 32:30.323
<i>She's got me so dizzy, I'm about to fall</i>
<i>It's MJ with the ideas</i>

32:30.406 --> 32:32.533
<i>This band can't even be stopped by the DEA</i>

32:32.617 --> 32:34.869
<i>Nobody can trace us</i>

32:34.953 --> 32:37.872
<i>Because we're The Nonames</i>

32:38.706 --> 32:41.876
<i>We're The Nonames</i>
<i>Yeah…</i>

32:41.960 --> 32:45.880
Ladies and gentlemen, our lead singer.

32:45.964 --> 32:47.674
Jana Cohen Gandía.

32:49.842 --> 32:52.929
<i>Esteban, Andi, The Nonames</i>

32:54.097 --> 32:55.682
<i>MJ, Jana</i>

32:55.765 --> 32:57.392
<i>The Nonames</i>

32:57.475 --> 32:59.727
<i>I'm Dixon, baby.</i>

32:59.811 --> 33:01.270
<i>The Nonames</i>

33:01.354 --> 33:03.147
<i>Together we are</i>

33:03.773 --> 33:05.441
<i>The Nonames</i>

33:07.735 --> 33:08.695
That was good.

33:09.320 --> 33:10.697
What do you want, Luka?

33:11.239 --> 33:12.907
Good to see you too, Jani.

33:13.950 --> 33:15.910
I wanted to know if…

33:19.956 --> 33:20.790
Today, please.

33:21.416 --> 33:23.167
I think he's trying to be nice.

33:24.669 --> 33:26.379
If you'd accept
another member in the band.

33:27.213 --> 33:28.631
-Of course.
-What?

33:29.215 --> 33:30.258
The more the merrier.

33:30.967 --> 33:32.176
Thank you.

33:33.094 --> 33:35.263
Thanks. Okay.

33:36.639 --> 33:39.726
MAKE SURE TO JOIN MJ'S BAND

33:39.809 --> 33:42.812
THIS BETTER BE WORTH IT

33:44.272 --> 33:46.315
All right, I liked it.

33:46.399 --> 33:48.234
I think it was really good.

33:51.279 --> 33:52.822
<i>The Nonames</i>

33:52.905 --> 33:53.781
Right?

34:01.164 --> 34:02.665
Give me a second.

34:04.584 --> 34:08.379
First you were my biggest fan,
now it's like I don't exist.

34:09.213 --> 34:10.631
You exist, trust me.

34:10.715 --> 34:12.050
The whole world knows.

34:12.133 --> 34:13.593
Everyone saw you sign up

34:13.676 --> 34:15.928
holding hands with the worst guy here.

34:16.012 --> 34:18.264
I told you, I needed to win.

34:18.765 --> 34:22.101
Sebas is an idiot,
but unlike other people,

34:22.185 --> 34:26.272
he has access to things
I could never get on my own,

34:27.148 --> 34:28.566
and I'm lost without him.

34:29.484 --> 34:31.277
So, you're back together.

34:33.321 --> 34:34.614
It's not that simple.

34:35.156 --> 34:36.032
Isn't it?

34:36.532 --> 34:38.618
Just help me understand,

34:38.701 --> 34:40.912
because I don't know when

34:40.995 --> 34:43.873
I started explaining my decisions to you.

34:43.956 --> 34:46.959
It's just that
you don't need that dude, Emilia.

34:47.710 --> 34:49.170
You really don't get it.

34:49.837 --> 34:51.089
Get what?

34:51.839 --> 34:55.551
That you're crazy-talented
and charismatic?

34:56.761 --> 34:59.722
That you're amazing at everything you do?

35:00.473 --> 35:01.724
Come on, Emilia.

35:03.518 --> 35:07.021
I swear you're the most
beautiful woman I've ever seen.

35:07.105 --> 35:09.273
But that doesn't compare to your voice…

35:36.509 --> 35:37.510
Are you coming?

35:38.094 --> 35:40.012
I'll catch up with you guys.

35:40.680 --> 35:41.514
No worries.

36:19.302 --> 36:21.429
LUKA LOVES LUKA

36:21.512 --> 36:23.181
His ego is unbelievable.

36:23.764 --> 36:25.016
Obviously.

36:27.518 --> 36:28.769
Esteban? Hey.

36:28.853 --> 36:29.687
Hi.

36:30.188 --> 36:33.357
I just wanted to say thanks
for all your support.

36:34.650 --> 36:37.361
For joining the band. Our band.

36:37.445 --> 36:38.946
It was really nice of you.

36:45.077 --> 36:47.955
CAN WE TALK?

36:48.039 --> 36:50.333
I'LL SEE YOU IN YOUR ROOM

36:54.712 --> 36:57.215
Are you nervous?
I get nervous too, sometimes.

37:05.223 --> 37:06.057
Jana.

39:30.993 --> 39:32.828
