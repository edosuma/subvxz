01:48.658 --> 01:50.257
My name is Johannes,

01:50.365 --> 01:52.086
and I have a condition.

01:52.729 --> 01:53.966
I'm human.

01:54.132 --> 01:57.925
I first realized that when
I fell on my face on a concrete slab

01:58.212 --> 02:00.002
on a beach in Italy.

02:00.889 --> 02:02.160
I was four.

02:02.429 --> 02:04.262
And it was clear to me:

02:04.559 --> 02:06.927
beaches cannot be trusted,

02:07.179 --> 02:08.872
I hated Italy,

02:09.048 --> 02:11.502
and dreams can be broken.

02:12.297 --> 02:14.738
The human is a narrative being.

02:14.992 --> 02:16.843
We construct emotional machines...

02:16.912 --> 02:19.305
so called stories, to communicate

02:19.366 --> 02:21.425
to share the world in which we live

02:21.428 --> 02:23.770
and make it collectively experienceable.

02:24.158 --> 02:26.385
And we're pretty good
at doing that.

02:26.553 --> 02:31.145
Since the primoridial zoo
Mendelized into primate brains,

02:31.153 --> 02:33.580
we have either been fleeing
from big cats

02:33.582 --> 02:36.026
or telling others about
our escapes

02:36.030 --> 02:38.921
from the clutches of big cats.

02:39.520 --> 02:41.113
Sitting around a campfire

02:41.140 --> 02:43.582
interpreting and
breaking-down the world,

02:43.643 --> 02:45.243
charging it with meaning,

02:45.481 --> 02:49.777
regardless of whether the details hold up
to a <i>Wikipedia</i> check, or not.

02:50.222 --> 02:52.542
The human is also a political being,

02:52.667 --> 02:56.127
although many members of my species
don't like that idea.

02:56.806 --> 02:58.106
Get used to it.

02:58.192 --> 03:00.233
You can't avoid being politcal.

03:00.338 --> 03:04.583
The moment you choose to buy
a sugar-free <i>Red Bull™</i> at <i>Walmart™,</i>

03:04.618 --> 03:06.683
you commit a political act.

03:06.801 --> 03:09.053
The same is true when you
drag a royalty-free

03:09.055 --> 03:11.816
hip-hop version
of Pachelbel's <i>Canon in D</i>

03:11.905 --> 03:13.305
into your shopping basket @

03:13.307 --> 03:15.252
—►    pond5.com    ◄—

03:15.371 --> 03:19.325
{\an8}Politics is the practice of
distribution of power and resources

03:19.352 --> 03:24.263
within the given community as well as
the interrelationship between communities.

03:24.638 --> 03:25.638
Period.

03:25.860 --> 03:28.930
We project a certain story
out to the world.

03:29.210 --> 03:33.357
The story differs if you are a leftist,
a progressive, or conservative,

03:33.423 --> 03:34.552
but be assured,

03:34.634 --> 03:37.429
most people I know
who call themselves anarchists

03:37.431 --> 03:39.614
are just stupid libertarians.

03:40.280 --> 03:45.015
We communicate our views by
using narrative and conceptual shortcuts.

03:45.236 --> 03:46.753
Abbreviated terms like:

03:46.778 --> 03:50.122
"freedom" or "privacy"
and so on.

03:50.391 --> 03:52.646
These shortcuts are important.

03:52.814 --> 03:56.030
{\an8}If someone had called
'global warming' something different,

03:56.033 --> 03:58.826
{\an8}let's say, 'atmosphere cancer,'

03:59.190 --> 04:02.074
you wouldn't have problems
explaining why it's a bad thing.

04:02.789 --> 04:07.671
I always wanted to create a glossary
of all-important terms.

04:07.906 --> 04:10.749
Because Jesus Fuckin' McChrist,

04:10.787 --> 04:15.860
they're always used and abused
in common sections on the World Wide Web.

04:16.370 --> 04:21.564
I wanted to give some of these
golden calfs of discourse a second look,

04:21.781 --> 04:26.650
to explain, re-evaluate,
and maybe even sacrifice them.

04:26.970 --> 04:29.544
I teamed up with my
good friend Ishan Raval,

04:29.749 --> 04:32.790
{\an8}who definitely matches me
in my political leanings.

04:32.992 --> 04:36.686
{\an8}I mean, look,
we both have our hands on our chins

04:36.931 --> 04:38.494
in our <i>Google</i> profile pics.

04:39.616 --> 04:41.099
Pompous little fucks we are.

04:41.256 --> 04:44.047
And because I know
a lot of creative performers

04:44.239 --> 04:47.081
who will do pretty much anything
for almost nothing,

04:47.124 --> 04:48.758
I decided to make this film.

04:48.817 --> 04:51.321
<i>How much longer
do I have to hold this shit?    It's heavy!</i>

04:51.389 --> 04:55.014
Well, y-you can put it in your resumé.
I mean come on... a little bit longer.

04:55.708 --> 04:57.772
<i>-And we used my car.</i>

04:58.067 --> 05:00.755
You're the head of
transportation fleets, okay?

05:01.015 --> 05:02.612
So, well, never forget,

05:02.828 --> 05:04.296
you don't hate Italy,

05:04.520 --> 05:05.991
you hate capitalism.

05:06.153 --> 05:09.784
What a big word!
So big!

05:10.104 --> 05:11.760
Capitalism.

05:12.280 --> 05:15.343
One of the biggest words I know...
and I know a lot of words.

05:15.634 --> 05:16.634
There's

05:16.659 --> 05:21.428
"Market"  (true, but that one
sounds a bit too mystical).

05:22.531 --> 05:25.556
Oh!
I think that's Brian Ewok.

05:25.801 --> 05:27.378
Good to have a
comfy seat

05:27.385 --> 05:29.902
at my favorite hippster
coffee shop and wine bar

05:29.959 --> 05:31.425
enjoying free Wi-Fi

05:31.656 --> 05:34.564
from a network
whose password is  "Helvetica."

05:34.718 --> 05:36.446
I'm just
minding my own business,

05:36.472 --> 05:38.889
when I get spotted
by Madame Juju,

05:38.971 --> 05:41.615
the friendly hippster
coffee shop and wine bar owner

05:41.713 --> 05:43.391
who does sweat yoga.

05:43.450 --> 05:45.922
<i>Hello.
How can I help you?</i>

05:45.959 --> 05:49.893
<i>A double eggnog frappucino
with tofu-breaded halibut?</i>

05:50.080 --> 05:53.280
There's a sticker for the
Green Party candidate behind the bar.

05:53.382 --> 05:56.403
<i>Oh, I  </i> love  <i>the Greens!</i>

05:56.488 --> 05:59.202
<i>So friendly!  So caring!</i>

05:59.329 --> 06:00.976
<i>So cuddly!</i>

06:01.186 --> 06:02.901
Marx once called the State

06:02.903 --> 06:06.979
a committee for managing the
common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie.

06:07.373 --> 06:09.687
Thank the non-existing God for it!

06:09.749 --> 06:14.152
Because where management is possible,
so also is mismanagement.

06:14.388 --> 06:16.588
And some parts of the bourgeoisie,

06:16.753 --> 06:20.897
especially those who do sweat yoga
and keep their hearts wholesome,

06:21.029 --> 06:25.075
might be persuaded to use
that committee against their interests.

06:25.452 --> 06:29.304
Basically, there are people
who own the means of production.

06:29.379 --> 06:34.662
Let's say fancy coffee machines,
or servers, or farms, or server farms.

06:34.819 --> 06:36.587
That's the bourgeoisie.

06:36.829 --> 06:41.162
And then there are people who don't own
the means of production or capital,

06:41.365 --> 06:43.420
so they have to sell their work.

06:43.572 --> 06:47.702
The workers.   That's all the barristas
and sandwich artists

06:47.705 --> 06:49.754
and <i>Ryanair®</i> check in personnel.

06:49.819 --> 06:54.290
But even if the bourgeoisie,
which includes Madame Juju,

06:54.423 --> 06:57.724
might not be united
in its political allegiances

06:58.015 --> 06:59.744
they play the same purpose.

06:59.803 --> 07:01.256
It isn't her fault.

07:01.310 --> 07:03.146
<i>It isn't my fault.</i>

07:03.341 --> 07:06.075
In all corners and cortices of her brain,

07:06.195 --> 07:08.422
she might just regard this as her job.

07:08.590 --> 07:10.136
 An innocent livelihood.

07:10.160 --> 07:12.431
And even,
a community service.

07:12.664 --> 07:16.144
<i>Oh, absolutely!
People love me.</i>

07:16.345 --> 07:21.291
<i>I am the Maggie Gyllenhaal
of safron-based cake frosting.</i>

07:21.492 --> 07:23.305
All of that, it might be.

07:23.603 --> 07:27.605
But capitalism is bigger than
any of our lives and wills.

07:27.803 --> 07:31.662
It produces net effects
some capitalists don't realize.

07:31.904 --> 07:35.106
Madame Juju's heart may not
be driven by profit,

07:35.365 --> 07:37.200
but her business must be.

07:37.333 --> 07:39.511
Money must make more money.

07:39.708 --> 07:41.241
More money must be made

07:41.558 --> 07:45.534
so that it can keep up with competing
coffee shops and wine bars,

07:45.632 --> 07:49.929
which are constatly coming up
and trying to out-perform Madame Juju.

07:50.075 --> 07:52.182
<i>It makes me cry.</i>

07:52.372 --> 07:56.500
<i>It's not even enough for me
to earn back the money I invested.</i>

07:57.004 --> 08:00.823
<i>There has to be a good return
on investment.</i>

08:02.526 --> 08:05.708
<i>There have to be upgrades
to match the latest</i>

08:05.759 --> 08:08.307
<i>speedy, spicy, sprinkle trends;</i>

08:08.404 --> 08:11.184
<i>or to keep paying an increasing rent</i>

08:11.219 --> 08:14.148
<i>so that the coffee
doesn't get more expensive.</i>

08:14.213 --> 08:17.199
<i>Otherwise, everyone will go to...</i>

08:17.576 --> 08:20.471
<i>Monsieur Dudu's down the street.</i>

08:20.543 --> 08:21.543
It's true.

08:21.545 --> 08:23.022
His coffee is okay,

08:23.174 --> 08:26.473
but his wine selection
is out of this world.

08:26.711 --> 08:29.606
So, Madame Juju
is forced to cut costs

08:29.712 --> 08:31.654
by not protecting the environment,

08:31.824 --> 08:34.006
or by paying super-low wages.

08:34.097 --> 08:36.080
<i>It is so very sad</i>

08:36.270 --> 08:38.938
<i>but, I donate to</i>
Amnesty International.

08:39.297 --> 08:43.557
Overall, the wealth of the world
increases on the side of the capital,

08:43.602 --> 08:46.237
be it money uninvested and stagnant...

08:46.315 --> 08:49.890
<i>There are some trillions of dollars
around like that today.</i>

08:49.947 --> 08:52.831
or the things required
for and by business.

08:52.983 --> 08:55.562
And wealth decreases
on the side of the world

08:55.590 --> 08:57.125
where costs are cut.

08:57.254 --> 08:59.995
People working for wages
and the world itself.

09:00.375 --> 09:02.397
Take atmosphere cancer.

09:02.505 --> 09:05.300
Sadly it's not capitalism's
side-effect,

09:05.502 --> 09:07.916
but a sign of its normal functioning.

09:08.006 --> 09:10.901
The system was for the last
one hundred years,

09:11.039 --> 09:14.461
running on cheap oil
and making a huge profit with it.

09:14.715 --> 09:17.306
Money still needs
to make more money.

09:17.411 --> 09:21.137
So more and more things
have to be exchangeable for money.

09:21.485 --> 09:24.931
Everything from gummy bears
to DNA sequences,

09:25.138 --> 09:27.169
to carbon dioxide emissions.

09:27.337 --> 09:29.309
<i>But Friedman says that</i>

09:29.344 --> 09:34.113
<i>economic freedom is the
precondition for political freedom.</i>

09:34.217 --> 09:35.587
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

09:35.644 --> 09:37.729
Not so fast, Madame Juju.

09:37.897 --> 09:41.623
Well, freedom is a huge word too,
yes, yes, but

09:41.767 --> 09:43.520
in the capitalist society

09:43.602 --> 09:45.442
there is only one freedom:

09:45.603 --> 09:47.797
the freedom of the market.

09:48.387 --> 09:52.945
At its root, capitalism is based on
three simple things:

09:53.352 --> 09:54.837
working for a wage,

09:54.954 --> 09:58.729
private ownership, or control of
the means of production,

09:58.984 --> 10:02.501
and production
for exchange and profit.

10:02.717 --> 10:06.204
And, it's all sold
with the promise of liberty.

10:06.414 --> 10:09.587
<i>But that has been true
since the beginning of time.</i>

10:09.648 --> 10:12.923
Capitalism didn't arise
according to natural laws

10:12.966 --> 10:14.989
that stem from human nature.

10:15.117 --> 10:17.852
It was spread by organized violence.

10:18.075 --> 10:20.002
The concept of private land

10:20.061 --> 10:24.344
and means of production might seem like
the natural state of things now,

10:24.439 --> 10:28.354
however, we should remember
it is a human concept... .

10:28.486 --> 10:30.420
First in places like England:

10:30.625 --> 10:34.822
enclosures drove self-sufficient peasants
from communal land

10:34.904 --> 10:37.592
into the cities to work in factories.

10:37.666 --> 10:40.243
Under the reign of
Henry the Eighth alone,

10:40.521 --> 10:43.516
72,000 people were executed

10:43.679 --> 10:45.238
for vagabondage.

10:45.298 --> 10:46.529
Is that freedom?

10:46.634 --> 10:51.891
Later, capitalism was spread rapidly
and violently around the globe.

10:52.207 --> 10:55.079
Do you remember
that nice little girl,  Alice?

10:55.383 --> 10:57.002
<i>Oh, yes, certainly!</i>

10:57.303 --> 10:58.403
<i>Lovely!</i>

10:58.786 --> 11:02.202
She fell into Wonderland,
used its resources,

11:02.394 --> 11:05.015
and was highly judgmental of the natives.

11:05.195 --> 11:08.202
A spoiled British imperialist brat!

11:08.525 --> 11:10.153
But the Germans weren't
much better.

11:10.260 --> 11:12.176
It's the year 1818.

11:12.703 --> 11:15.294
Powerful German merchants
started to profit

11:15.594 --> 11:18.932
from overseas commerce
in Asia and Africa.

11:19.215 --> 11:24.327
The German Empire supported this expansion
by conquering large amounts of land

11:24.453 --> 11:27.253
and established so-called "protectorates."

11:27.408 --> 11:30.369
With fraud, Bible, alcohol and violence,

11:30.504 --> 11:35.490
the German Empire grew to a staggering
2.6 million square kilometers,

11:35.783 --> 11:38.601
five times the size of Germany...

11:38.947 --> 11:41.381
reaching the third place
in colonial power,

11:41.628 --> 11:43.694
right after England and France.

11:44.459 --> 11:47.926
The following sarcastic folk song,
written in 1819,

11:48.360 --> 11:50.870
has its own perspective on the matter:

12:45.217 --> 12:46.455
<i>But wait!</i>

12:46.635 --> 12:48.475
<i>I like black people.</i>

12:48.863 --> 12:50.703
<i>They've got the rhythm.</i>

12:50.877 --> 12:54.002
<i>Equality and justice for everyone.</i>

12:54.418 --> 12:56.575
<i>I don't like the super rich.</i>

12:56.720 --> 12:59.489
<i>The middle class is under attack.</i>

12:59.939 --> 13:03.016
<i>The goddamn politicians are to blame.</i>

13:03.258 --> 13:05.310
Most liberal cosmopolitan folks

13:05.335 --> 13:09.687
lack faith in public institutions,
ideals and poliiticians.

13:09.976 --> 13:12.276
The notoriety of left-leaning authors

13:12.278 --> 13:15.746
like Michael Moore
or, (gasps) Noam Chomsky,

13:15.902 --> 13:18.952
shows that our fellow humans
know very well

13:19.041 --> 13:21.582
what Moore claims is the awful truth,

13:21.782 --> 13:24.112
but they act as if they don't know.

13:24.446 --> 13:27.718
We have to realize that
everyone is part of the problem.

13:28.005 --> 13:31.677
It's our habits, our procedures,
that keep the game going.

13:31.989 --> 13:34.144
There is no good or bad capitalism.

13:34.226 --> 13:37.701
Inequality is an integral
part of capitalism.

13:37.792 --> 13:42.085
Everything including humans,
is treated as a mere resource.

13:42.248 --> 13:44.206
<i>I like punk rock.</i>

13:44.296 --> 13:46.435
<i>I make my own sweaters.</i>

13:46.544 --> 13:48.821
<i>I recycle plastic bottles.</i>

13:48.935 --> 13:52.105
<i>I enjoy books by Terry Pratchett.</i>

13:52.187 --> 13:54.090
<i>I am a Buddhist.</i>

13:54.493 --> 13:55.826
That is nice of you.

13:55.981 --> 13:58.674
But remember that
market driven capitalism

13:58.780 --> 14:01.454
musters the quasi-scientific discourses

14:01.458 --> 14:03.858
of marketing and public relations

14:03.941 --> 14:06.769
and increasingly, eastern religion,

14:06.799 --> 14:09.066
to recommend products to consumers

14:09.241 --> 14:12.900
as necessary means
in the liberal pursuit of happiness,

14:13.045 --> 14:16.432
self-fulfillment and personal freedom.

14:16.588 --> 14:21.669
{\an8}Sometimes, there is
so much beauty in the world!

14:21.986 --> 14:25.324
{\an8}I feel like I can't take it!

14:25.476 --> 14:29.250
<i>Well, capitalism has its downsides.</i>

14:29.441 --> 14:33.572
<i>But, it's way better than communism...
...that's really bad!</i>

14:33.574 --> 14:35.392
<i>It killed people!</i>

14:35.563 --> 14:38.919
<i>Even worse... it didn't work.</i>

14:39.144 --> 14:41.313
Let us quote Marx himself:

14:41.562 --> 14:43.401
"The categorical imperative

14:43.887 --> 14:45.887
"is to overthrow all relations

14:45.961 --> 14:47.279
"in which man

14:47.369 --> 14:52.066
is a debased, enslaved, forsaken,
despicable being."

14:52.531 --> 14:55.317
This imperative is true for all conditions.

14:55.481 --> 15:00.540
Even the ones created by perverted
misinterpretaions of his writings.

15:00.709 --> 15:03.234
State communism killed a ton of people

15:03.377 --> 15:04.816
and the sad truth

15:04.849 --> 15:07.839
is that it was based
on the principle of a state.

15:07.901 --> 15:10.034
It created forms of property.

15:10.215 --> 15:13.498
It had banks, police, even a market.

15:13.749 --> 15:16.752
State communism was a badly adapted,

15:16.810 --> 15:19.733
botched version
of the rules of capitalism.

15:19.817 --> 15:21.880
We shouldn't shed a tear for it.

15:22.114 --> 15:26.324
<i>True, and socialism
penalizes high achievers,</i>

15:26.434 --> 15:31.119
<i>rewards laziness, cuts freedom
and stifles choice.</i>

15:31.258 --> 15:32.638
<i>Ayn Rand says,</i>

15:32.744 --> 15:34.750
Ayn Rand died on welfare.

15:35.041 --> 15:37.374
<i>that socialism stifles competition,</i>

15:37.753 --> 15:40.521
<i>impeding technological progess.</i>

15:40.802 --> 15:45.382
May I jump in an remark,

15:45.998 --> 15:51.704
that one of the largest
cooperative projects

15:51.726 --> 15:54.670
and planned economies

15:54.763 --> 15:58.370
was ironically,

15:59.153 --> 16:02.174
the Apollo project

16:02.951 --> 16:07.911
to put the middle class American
on the moon.

16:09.089 --> 16:11.388
So, let's have a ...

16:12.342 --> 16:14.114
...and technology...

16:20.017 --> 16:21.863
I'm at six G.

16:22.026 --> 16:23.693
Excuse me for a moment...

16:31.740 --> 16:33.847
<i>This is Hans Platzgaumer.</i>

16:34.327 --> 16:37.348
<i>He enjoys craft beer
and gory movies...</i>

16:37.501 --> 16:39.168
<i>in the Italian tradition.</i>

16:40.675 --> 16:42.886
<i>And, he's a passionate gamer.</i>

16:43.840 --> 16:45.268
Jesus!

16:49.957 --> 16:53.290
You're going to need some lube
and a tow truck

16:53.745 --> 16:56.025
to pull my boot out of your ass!

16:57.809 --> 17:00.452
<i>Do you have a minute
to talk about something important?</i>

17:00.504 --> 17:01.504
Huh?

17:01.622 --> 17:03.145
Where's this voice coming from?

17:03.367 --> 17:05.767
<i>I am your cerebral cortex.</i>

17:05.972 --> 17:07.175
<i>Listen!</i>

17:07.219 --> 17:08.219
That's weird.

17:08.810 --> 17:12.718
<i>Through the dark and not so dark
millennia of human history,</i>

17:12.976 --> 17:16.512
<i>we've organized ourselves into
adversarial cliques,</i>

17:16.667 --> 17:19.127
<i>communities and nations.</i>

17:19.363 --> 17:24.156
<i>World events were like
deadly ping pong balls hurtling towards us.</i>

17:24.281 --> 17:27.815
<i>And these groups were the paddles,
whose goal it was</i>

17:27.961 --> 17:30.961
<i>to knock the ball
into someone else's court.</i>

17:31.842 --> 17:33.903
What a crazy-ass metaphor!

17:34.189 --> 17:35.574
<i>Add military might,</i>

17:35.632 --> 17:37.672
<i>as the means to hold in place</i>

17:37.837 --> 17:40.237
<i>the lopsided system of distribution</i>

17:40.549 --> 17:44.530
<i>in which workers create
more and more economic value</i>

17:44.601 --> 17:48.583
<i>for wages... that never quite
grow at the same rate.</i>

17:49.068 --> 17:50.377
<i>And, lo,</i>

17:50.412 --> 17:52.522
<i>competion became the fabric</i>

17:52.627 --> 17:54.961
<i>in which everyday life was dressed.</i>

17:55.560 --> 17:57.321
<i>The technology necessary</i>

17:57.396 --> 17:59.095
<i>for global cooperation</i>

17:59.300 --> 18:00.841
<i>did not exist.</i>

18:01.156 --> 18:03.506
<i>Comptetition was thus established</i>

18:03.634 --> 18:06.868
<i>as the default way of
interacting with the world.</i>

18:07.342 --> 18:11.771
<i>In its genteel form,
competition meant nobody got killed.</i>

18:12.084 --> 18:14.210
<i>Gladiators turned to soccer....</i>

18:14.391 --> 18:16.604
<i>or turned to table tennis.</i>

18:17.139 --> 18:19.031
<i>By 1972,</i>

18:19.175 --> 18:23.859
<i>computers became advanced enough
to simulate competitive games...</i>

18:23.980 --> 18:26.184
<i>and</i> Pong <i>was born.</i>

18:26.274 --> 18:27.929
Pong.  Wha?

18:28.594 --> 18:31.267
<i>Humans are a competitive species.</i>

18:31.717 --> 18:35.241
<i>But we shouldn't forget
that cooperation and altruism</i>

18:35.339 --> 18:38.162
<i>are as much hard-wired into our brains.</i>

18:38.218 --> 18:41.993
But what does that have to do
with that old-school video game?

18:42.200 --> 18:45.600
<i>If we dont want the </i> Pong <i> ball
to go off the table,</i>

18:45.685 --> 18:49.279
<i>we can program the computer
to control the paddles better</i>

18:49.372 --> 18:51.324
<i>than any human can.</i>

18:51.690 --> 18:54.371
<i>Our desire to play competitive</i> Pong

18:54.571 --> 18:57.982
<i>versus other humans
through obsolete hand operation</i>

18:58.111 --> 19:01.931
<i>is nothing but a vain show of
one-upmanship.</i>

19:02.233 --> 19:05.783
<i>There's no other point to
competitive gaming in the computer age.</i>

19:05.885 --> 19:09.811
What the actual fuck?  Fuck!  Fuck!

19:09.857 --> 19:13.251
<i>That's just your limbic system,
trying to interfere.</i>

19:13.593 --> 19:15.263
<i>Pay attention to me.</i>

19:15.726 --> 19:18.296
<i>Technology could save us,
if we'd let it.</i>

19:18.845 --> 19:21.962
<i>There's enough material wealth
for everyone on the planet</i>

19:22.029 --> 19:25.634
<i>to have a sturdy home
and a steady food supply.</i>

19:25.825 --> 19:27.617
<i>If we stop competing</i>

19:27.746 --> 19:32.302
<i>and use our global communication
and computation capabilities</i>

19:32.457 --> 19:34.190
<i>to level the playing field.</i>

19:34.394 --> 19:37.557
But, competition is wonderful!

19:37.725 --> 19:40.815
I've come here to
chew bubblegum and kick ass!

19:40.927 --> 19:42.880
And I'm all out of bubblegum.

19:43.000 --> 19:46.663
<i>Competitive systems, such as
evolution and capitalism,</i>

19:46.727 --> 19:50.634
<i>are terriffic at creating
unpredictable change very quickly.</i>

19:50.981 --> 19:53.129
<i>It's the trial by error system.</i>

19:53.672 --> 19:56.611
<i>If you're looking for
a wide variety of output,</i>

19:56.694 --> 19:58.975
<i>competitive systems are the best.</i>

19:59.473 --> 20:04.395
<i>Not only will the product of such systems
tend to improve over time,</i>

20:04.726 --> 20:07.920
<i>they'll fill just about any niche
available to them.</i>

20:08.363 --> 20:11.067
<i>A competititive system,
such as a market</i>

20:11.197 --> 20:13.723
<i>also has its merits as a censor</i>

20:13.965 --> 20:17.165
<i>in approximating
what and how much people want.</i>

20:17.389 --> 20:20.559
See!
See,  it's a good thing!

20:21.117 --> 20:26.114
<i>Competition can be a great inspiration
to develop skills related to the goal.</i>

20:26.563 --> 20:29.257
<i>Which is great,
if inspiration is needed</i>

20:29.337 --> 20:31.192
<i>...and the skills are useful ones.</i>

20:31.753 --> 20:33.865
<i>In a system like  </i> Pong,<i>  however,</i>

20:34.097 --> 20:37.015
<i>you just wind-up
getteing better at playing</i> Pong.

20:37.527 --> 20:39.545
<i>A competitive system, also</i>

20:39.627 --> 20:43.654
<i>is great for ensuring that
people who are ahead in the game</i>

20:43.790 --> 20:46.933
<i>get exactly what they want,
when they want it.</i>

20:47.441 --> 20:51.379
<i>A hawk uses highly evolved vision
to catch its prey.</i>

20:51.804 --> 20:55.373
<i>and first-worlders use
their superior buying-power</i>

20:55.410 --> 20:56.538
<i>to get</i>  iPad™s.

20:56.634 --> 20:58.004
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

20:58.396 --> 21:02.095
Don't speak about
Steve Jobs' products in vain!

21:02.440 --> 21:05.081
You're making me very angry!

21:05.411 --> 21:08.606
<i>Although competitive systems
produce good things,</i>

21:08.678 --> 21:11.307
<i>such as human beings
and diet cola,</i>

21:11.412 --> 21:13.289
<i>we also wind up with things</i>

21:13.417 --> 21:16.517
<i>such as wooly mammoths
and guided missles.</i>

21:16.975 --> 21:21.041
<i>It's a horribly inefficient way
of producing things people need.</i>

21:21.549 --> 21:23.996
<i>Most energy in
a competitive system</i>

21:24.238 --> 21:26.638
<i>is spent not in
producing a product,</i>

21:27.182 --> 21:28.971
<i>but in staying competititve.</i>

21:29.900 --> 21:32.761
<i>In evolution,
this waste manifests</i>

21:32.900 --> 21:35.083
<i>in a less-than-desireable cycle</i>

21:35.259 --> 21:38.447
<i>of predator-prey adaptation-escalation,</i>

21:38.660 --> 21:42.978
<i>where more energy is spent surviving,
than enjoying life.</i>

21:43.848 --> 21:45.092
<i>In capitalism,</i>

21:45.117 --> 21:47.631
<i>it results in the
same sort of relationship,</i>

21:47.808 --> 21:51.818
<i>except between those with capital value
and those without.</i>

21:52.320 --> 21:54.720
<i>People who don't have
capital value</i>

21:54.854 --> 21:57.730
<i>are trapped working
for those who do.</i>

21:58.001 --> 22:01.959
<i>And their energy is directed towards
keeping their team...</i>

22:01.997 --> 22:03.631
<i>competitive.</i>

22:06.786 --> 22:08.657
I'm a team player.

22:09.091 --> 22:11.094
<i>In our competitive system,</i>

22:11.223 --> 22:14.631
<i>most of our energy uses
are redundant and wasteful.</i>

22:14.893 --> 22:18.630
<i>Redundancy is the result of
the wasted overhead</i>

22:18.699 --> 22:23.486
<i>when multiple people are working
on the same problem on different teams.</i>

22:23.763 --> 22:27.913
<i>Team</i>  Coke™ <i>and team</i>  Pepsi™
<i>are both working on the cola problem.</i>

22:28.099 --> 22:29.131
<i>But each spends</i>

22:29.155 --> 22:32.400
<i>huge amounts of resources
battling the other.</i>

22:32.866 --> 22:36.315
<i>Even within a supposedly
cooperative society,</i>

22:36.725 --> 22:40.991
<i>most businesses exist in order
to support other buisnesses.</i>

22:41.645 --> 22:45.590
<i>How much would the production of
our essential goods decrease</i>

22:45.867 --> 22:47.898
<i>if we laid-off our accountants</i>

22:48.021 --> 22:50.811
<i>and all the people
who supply computers to them</i>

22:50.915 --> 22:54.565
<i>and all the people who print
brochures for the computer salesmen</i>

22:54.695 --> 22:58.361
<i>and the people who produce the ink
for those brochures</i>

22:58.627 --> 23:00.909
<i>and the people
who make packaged food</i>

23:01.076 --> 23:04.167
<i>for the truckers who drive
those materials around?</i>

23:04.581 --> 23:07.764
<i>We have seen a ballooning of
what David Graeber calls:</i>

23:07.893 --> 23:09.153
<i>"bullshit jobs."</i>

23:09.235 --> 23:10.418
(belches)

23:11.473 --> 23:13.580
Bullshit jobs?

23:13.694 --> 23:17.253
<i>Services, like financial stuff
or telemarketing.</i>

23:17.541 --> 23:22.492
<i>Even ancillary industries like
dog washers and all-night pizza delivery</i>

23:22.543 --> 23:25.234
<i>exist only because everyone else</i>

23:25.409 --> 23:29.911
<i>is spending so much of their time
working in all the other ones.</i>

23:30.572 --> 23:34.799
<i>In</i>  Pong,<i> the fact that your opponent
keeps hitting the ball at you</i>

23:34.953 --> 23:38.659
<i>means you must spend your resources
defending your goal,</i>

23:38.825 --> 23:42.151
<i>instead of using your time for
more noble endeavors.</i>

23:42.733 --> 23:45.008
That sounds like propaganda.

23:45.137 --> 23:46.260
Boring!

23:47.071 --> 23:49.005
Can we watch
a splatt film instead?

24:04.191 --> 24:05.846
Boring!

24:06.163 --> 24:08.217
Can we listen to
propaganda again?

24:08.366 --> 24:11.966
<i>Evolution and capitalism
have brought us to the point</i>

24:12.073 --> 24:16.816
<i>where it's possible to propel ourselves
out of our current state of affairs.</i>

24:17.240 --> 24:19.810
<i>Things that used to be
competitive games,</i>

24:19.978 --> 24:24.260
<i>should now be cooperative ones,
or not games at all.</i>

24:24.912 --> 24:27.618
<i>We have the
compuitational power needed</i>

24:27.661 --> 24:32.670
<i>to ensure basic goods are produced
and distributed optimally.</i>

24:33.256 --> 24:36.384
<i>We can wisely respond
to global crisis.</i>

24:36.697 --> 24:38.784
<i>By breaking market dependency,</i>

24:39.151 --> 24:42.487
<i>we could create an economy
of complexity,</i>

24:42.663 --> 24:44.036
<i>unpredictability</i>

24:44.206 --> 24:45.919
<i> and genuine freedom</i>

24:46.032 --> 24:47.953
<i>that capitalism has enabled</i>

24:48.235 --> 24:50.069
<i>but also constrained.</i>

24:50.346 --> 24:51.645
<i>In the new world,</i>

24:51.727 --> 24:53.315
<i>we'll be able to relax</i>

24:53.416 --> 24:55.276
<i>and let technology do the job.</i>

24:55.903 --> 24:57.426
<i>Try it !</i>

24:58.169 --> 25:00.150
I control the ball

25:00.323 --> 25:02.314
and it doesn't let me lose.

25:05.181 --> 25:06.181
Awesome!

25:07.989 --> 25:11.223
<i>The</i> Pong <i>ball will
never fall off the table again.</i>

25:23.120 --> 25:27.463
A fresh idea isn't it?
So neat, so different, so countercultural.

25:28.830 --> 25:30.491
It's the early 19th century.

25:30.860 --> 25:34.931
The Catholic township of Oberstetten,
in Württemberg, now a part of Germany,

25:34.988 --> 25:37.584
announces to the neighboring commune
of Bernloch,

25:37.587 --> 25:39.319
that the cows of Bernloch will

25:39.378 --> 25:42.405
no longer be mounted by
the bull of Uberstetsin.

25:42.472 --> 25:45.108
Bernloch had voted to
become Protestant.

25:45.416 --> 25:47.216
Some creative contermporaries,

25:47.255 --> 25:50.066
hmm, well, they write a song
about the case:

27:18.509 --> 27:21.885
Hello, I would like to
exchange fifty euros to dollars.

27:21.966 --> 27:24.495
<i>Okay,
Here's your receipt.</i>

27:24.847 --> 27:25.847
<i>Dollars.</i>

27:26.068 --> 27:29.693
Thank you very much.
And now, I would like to exchange these

27:29.804 --> 27:30.845
to euros.

27:30.904 --> 27:32.233
<i>We can cancel that.</i>

27:32.264 --> 27:33.174
No.

27:33.176 --> 27:34.926
<i>But you'll take a loss on that.</i>

27:35.102 --> 27:37.171
Well, that's the nature of things.

27:37.779 --> 27:39.938
<i>Forty-four euros.
There you are.</i>

27:40.236 --> 27:41.534
Ah, the leftovers.

27:41.988 --> 27:44.522
<i>So, this is your
thirty-five dollars.</i>

27:44.661 --> 27:47.861
Fine, I'll have these
exchanged to euros, then.

27:48.003 --> 27:49.076
<i>Uh-ha.</i>

27:49.243 --> 27:52.023
<i>So, there's the thirty-one,
thirty-five for you.</i>

27:52.128 --> 27:54.195
I'll exchange them for dollars.

Okay.

27:59.367 --> 28:01.167
<i>Okay, you get twenty-seven.</i>

28:01.374 --> 28:03.783
Well, can you exchange them
for euros then?

28:03.905 --> 28:05.728
<i>Twenty-three euros, fifty-nine.</i>

28:05.948 --> 28:07.015
Fine by me.

28:07.120 --> 28:10.155
Alright, let's exchange that
for dollars.

28:10.255 --> 28:11.455
What will that be?

28:11.525 --> 28:13.259
<i>I need twenty-three, fifty.</i>

28:13.513 --> 28:15.380
That was nineteen... okay.

28:15.619 --> 28:17.621
Can I get euros for this, please?

28:18.034 --> 28:20.101
And I'll have dollars for that.

28:20.201 --> 28:21.698
<i>Eleven dollars.</i>

28:21.717 --> 28:23.928
I see, fine.
In euros, please.

28:24.025 --> 28:26.012
Thanks.
<i>- Let's have a look.</i>

28:26.106 --> 28:28.249
I'd like these
exchanged to dollars.

28:28.561 --> 28:30.303
<i>We'll be done in no time now.</i>

28:30.373 --> 28:32.897
I'll have these four,
exchange them please.

28:33.050 --> 28:35.081
Forty cents.
You can't change this?

28:35.168 --> 28:37.901
<i>No.</i>
- Okay, I will bid you thanks, then.

28:37.972 --> 28:39.101
<i>You're welcome.</i>

28:45.572 --> 28:48.660
{\an8}The worldwide amount of cash,
in coins and banknotes,

28:48.662 --> 28:50.582
{\an8}is twenty trillion euros.

28:51.031 --> 28:52.547
So, imagine

28:52.731 --> 28:53.950
to change that amount

28:54.143 --> 28:57.895
from euros to dollars to euros to dollars,
back and forth, back and forth,

28:58.281 --> 29:03.111
how many times would it take for fees
to eat up all that cash?

29:04.268 --> 29:05.686
Well, guess.

29:07.706 --> 29:09.098
Here is the formula.

29:10.832 --> 29:13.407
We put it into an <i>Excel™</i>  sheet.

29:13.593 --> 29:16.594
And the answer is,
eight hundred, forty-nine times.

29:16.802 --> 29:18.601
Eighteen cents remain.

29:19.006 --> 29:22.551
And two cents get eaten
by <i>Microsoft®  Excel™</i>  rounding errors.

29:22.883 --> 29:24.978
But Microsoft® always
gets its fair share.

29:25.675 --> 29:26.752
I need a break.

29:27.565 --> 29:32.125
I don't know why I keep returning
to coffee shops, I don't even like coffee.

29:32.160 --> 29:33.492
I'm a bad Austrian.

29:33.776 --> 29:36.439
Well, at least this one is
a hipster-free zone.

30:07.435 --> 30:09.978
<i>Oh please!
Just a couple of years ago,</i>

30:10.026 --> 30:11.644
<i>there was one in Salzburg,</i>

30:11.675 --> 30:15.459
<i>the one with the
plasticine penies on that horse.</i>

30:15.578 --> 30:18.224
<i>And what about Sárkány ??</i>

30:18.337 --> 30:21.549
And that is what madam would
consider a proper art scandal?   Please!

30:21.672 --> 30:23.176
If madam would allow me a remark,

30:23.266 --> 30:25.592
the longevity of such a scandal
is negligible,

30:25.650 --> 30:27.450
on a par with the music of a tweeter.

30:27.577 --> 30:30.871
We'll catch hell from the health department
if we serve you something like that.

30:31.022 --> 30:32.921
A poor excuse for an art scandal.

30:32.990 --> 30:34.207
<i>C'mon!</i>

30:34.461 --> 30:37.151
<i>This may be the last time I'm in Vienna</i>

30:37.178 --> 30:39.291
<i>and I want my art scandal!</i>

30:39.374 --> 30:42.306
<i>Like old times, 1968,</i>

30:42.357 --> 30:44.219
<i>une flèchele, you know ??</i>

30:44.309 --> 30:49.054
<i>When the Viennese actionists

30:49.150 --> 30:51.211
<i>Something risky!</i>

30:51.469 --> 30:52.802
<i>I'm an elderly woman,</i>

30:52.947 --> 30:56.989
<i>and I'm used to a certain level
of artistic extravagance.</i>

30:57.071 --> 30:58.195
I see.  I see.

30:58.556 --> 31:00.410
However, if that is what you are after,

31:00.412 --> 31:03.031
you'd have to live
in a  disciplinary  society,

31:03.197 --> 31:05.707
and you're in
the wrong place for that.

31:05.833 --> 31:07.797
<i>Oh, would you kindly explain?</i>

31:07.858 --> 31:12.107
<i>The last philosopher I read
was Habermas, in 1975.</i>

31:12.477 --> 31:14.026
Let's explain discipline.

31:14.194 --> 31:16.104
In the course of a lifetime,
an individual

31:16.106 --> 31:19.085
switches from one closed framework
of confinement to another.

31:19.397 --> 31:22.253
Where each one operates according
to its own laws.

31:22.335 --> 31:24.951
From a family, to a school,
then to a university,

31:24.953 --> 31:27.001
or factory, or the military,

31:27.231 --> 31:28.524
from time to time to the hospital

31:28.526 --> 31:31.632
and eventually, to the
quintessential framework of confinement,

31:31.699 --> 31:32.699
the prison.

31:32.835 --> 31:34.722
The function is always clear.

31:34.799 --> 31:36.643
Discipline and punishment.

31:36.991 --> 31:39.535
<i>And, and how does one
go about escaping?</i>

31:39.578 --> 31:41.978
<i>I can imagine
it must be difficult.</i>

31:42.141 --> 31:44.606
It's indeed difficult,  as you say,
but not impossible.

31:44.805 --> 31:47.630
Discipline and punishment
are certainly effective,

31:47.813 --> 31:50.157
yet at least it will produce
an inner resistance

31:50.182 --> 31:52.583
as well as the possibility
to avoid either.

31:53.065 --> 31:55.182
It's hard to monitor in absolute terms.

31:55.271 --> 31:56.824
And there are always ways of avoiding,

31:56.849 --> 32:00.650
if not hacking and ridiculing these
mechanisms of control.

32:00.812 --> 32:02.412
Let's take work as an example.

32:02.613 --> 32:03.651
You hate your boss,

32:03.654 --> 32:06.145
he commands you all the time,
he doesn't pay you enough,

32:06.262 --> 32:10.700
so you look for loopholes and niches,
like long trips to the toilet,

32:10.780 --> 32:13.692
theft of work materials,
misuse of hard and software,

32:13.694 --> 32:16.841
sick leave, pretending to look busy,
playing dumb.

32:16.895 --> 32:18.800
<i>I want my art scandal!</i>

32:18.921 --> 32:20.959
Forgive me madam,
you don't seem to understand.

32:21.151 --> 32:24.254
We are not really living in
a disciplinary society anymore

32:24.407 --> 32:26.810
and the world is changing into
a control society.

32:27.165 --> 32:30.979
For example, surveillance cameras
now have stickers on them that read:

32:31.076 --> 32:32.984
"Smile!  You are on camera!"

32:33.031 --> 32:34.899
It's friendly and abrasive!

32:35.231 --> 32:39.732
Or,  <i>Google®</i> created a free
alternate reality game called <i>Ingress™.</i>

32:39.842 --> 32:42.548
It is played and loved by
millions of people.

32:42.786 --> 32:45.738
The players don't realize that they
are actually entering

32:45.740 --> 32:48.683
geographical information
that could be used as themselves.

32:48.796 --> 32:52.925
<i>Google®</i> turned expensive,
labor intensve data entry into a game.

32:53.077 --> 32:55.904
And now people work for them free,
without even knowing it.

32:56.301 --> 32:58.781
One of the best examples
is my old religious studies book

32:58.842 --> 33:00.049
from the 1980s.

33:00.090 --> 33:03.357
It propagated a
responsible treatment of sexuality,

33:03.556 --> 33:05.659
instead of the age-old catechistic way.
[EASY LIVING]

33:05.857 --> 33:08.210
Masturbation was suddenly okay.

33:08.319 --> 33:11.308
But you had to do it in a responsible way.
[Easy Living  Catholic Religion]

33:11.458 --> 33:13.163
Madam, I hope you can understand
[Easy Living  Catholic Religion]

33:13.198 --> 33:16.420
that it is impossible to maintain
a responsible erection.

33:16.566 --> 33:20.145
It was all a perfidious trick
to internalize control.

33:20.351 --> 33:24.554
<i>Smelling?   Playing?
"Mestur-bating?"</i>

33:24.694 --> 33:26.898
The moment a person
internalizes the control,

33:27.104 --> 33:31.349
{\an8}making it an integral part of their
psychological make-up and their thinking,

33:31.635 --> 33:33.139
{\an8}it becomes absolute.

33:33.507 --> 33:35.904
{\an8}There is no longer anything external
to that component.

33:35.947 --> 33:37.968
You don't have to be told
to behave anymore,

33:37.970 --> 33:39.051
you want to behave.

33:39.156 --> 33:41.130
Because you think it's
good for you.

33:41.281 --> 33:43.591
And it's very hard to
subvert yourself.

33:43.740 --> 33:46.852
This is especially perfidious for
your breadwinning job.

33:47.049 --> 33:49.316
Your boss is your friend nowadays,

33:49.318 --> 33:51.640
because it makes it easier
to exploit you.

33:51.693 --> 33:53.937
Workers, now called employees,

33:53.964 --> 33:57.228
begin to identify with the
corporate identity of the firm itself,

33:57.289 --> 34:00.582
resulting in a kind of
spiritual share in the company. (thud)

34:01.109 --> 34:03.649
Did  you know that many corporations
now have their own anthems?

34:03.934 --> 34:07.973
{\an8}Look, here's the one of <i>Gazprom®</i>
performed by Vladimir Tumayev.

35:00.069 --> 35:04.615
<i>New liberal Russian drinking songs?
This is too much!</i>

35:04.725 --> 35:06.859
<i>I don't even like rum in my tea!</i>

35:07.062 --> 35:10.528
<i>My doctor tells me
I don't have much longer to live</i>

35:10.636 --> 35:12.271
<i>and just once more,</i>

35:12.281 --> 35:16.791
<i>I would love to experience a
genuine art scandal.</i>

35:16.899 --> 35:18.555
Where there are distinct boundaries,

35:18.560 --> 35:20.537
where there are established codes,

35:20.741 --> 35:23.907
that's where one can
effectively take action against them.

35:24.210 --> 35:27.174
Where there is a wall,
there's a hammer that fits.

35:27.236 --> 35:28.569
Cast your mind back,

35:28.594 --> 35:31.337
the police once arrested
members of the Viennese actualists

35:31.362 --> 35:33.320
for painting with blood,
or similar things.

35:33.393 --> 35:36.778
The outrage!
(Great word of the public.)

35:37.164 --> 35:39.697
Now, if you will
consider the context of the 1960s:

35:40.312 --> 35:43.106
A substantial Catholic society
living in Austria.

35:43.188 --> 35:46.181
Nowadays, if you want to put-on
a blood-painting performance,

35:46.260 --> 35:48.397
you would probably not even come-up
on the <i>Facebook®</i>

35:48.488 --> 35:50.355
in time enough for a Slovak toothist.

35:50.538 --> 35:53.354
<i>But waiter,
that's still no excuse.</i>

35:53.379 --> 35:57.205
<i>If one looks for it,
one can find a boundary.</i>

35:57.655 --> 35:59.483
<i>There are always boundaries.</i>

35:59.641 --> 36:02.907
<i>Because, look, see,
if I were to grab a pretzel,</i>

36:03.143 --> 36:06.610
<i>and stick it in my rather old cunt,
for all to see...</i>

36:07.057 --> 36:11.557
<i>I think that's a case in which
one might call it a 'transgression.'</i>

36:11.624 --> 36:13.555
Naturally, you could do that,

36:13.777 --> 36:17.256
but the boundaries that
you are transgressing, are arbitrary,

36:17.601 --> 36:21.852
and as far as Austria is concerned,
and I mean Austria as a social entity,

36:22.125 --> 36:23.814
I think it couldn't care less.

36:23.961 --> 36:27.392
(klaxon)

36:27.634 --> 36:29.558
<i>I'm fainting!</i>

36:29.750 --> 36:31.995
Calm down madam,
drink a glass of water.

36:32.137 --> 36:34.227
A scandal must involve an outrage

36:34.252 --> 36:36.933
in the sense of
a moral and passionate response.

36:37.035 --> 36:39.699
In a world of micro-societies
and niche capital,

36:39.758 --> 36:42.358
it is hard to hold a mirror to society.

36:42.553 --> 36:45.872
<i>But waiter,
that would be horrible!</i>

36:45.978 --> 36:47.131
Madam, you are right.

36:47.147 --> 36:48.260
But I refer you

36:48.299 --> 36:51.089
to an aural <i>"F***"</i>
interview with the German hip-hop maverick,

36:51.179 --> 36:52.223
Jan Delay.

36:52.274 --> 36:54.428
Where he says that
he wouldn't think twice

36:54.453 --> 36:56.205
about calling the Pope gay,

36:56.255 --> 36:57.906
but, mocking Islam

36:57.988 --> 37:01.156
is something he would never do...
out of too much respect.

37:01.387 --> 37:02.514
What a coward!

37:02.768 --> 37:03.901
<i>In other words,</i>

37:03.905 --> 37:07.377
<i>as long as people
have boundaries of respect,</i>

37:07.706 --> 37:09.181
<i>there will be scandals?</i>

37:09.279 --> 37:10.279
Yes!

37:10.389 --> 37:11.554
More or less.

37:11.628 --> 37:13.316
But these boundaries of respect

37:13.320 --> 37:16.604
are becoming
progressively smaller and smaller.

37:17.136 --> 37:18.919
<b>Punk is dead.</b>

37:19.156 --> 37:20.905
<i>So what am I to do?</i>

37:20.971 --> 37:24.954
Simply seek out a new
geographical focus for your life.

37:25.098 --> 37:28.298
You're saying,
I should leave beautiful Austria?

37:28.480 --> 37:29.779
Don't get nostalgic.

37:29.876 --> 37:31.725
There would be
no Ai Weiweis without

37:31.776 --> 37:34.725
the wonderful and disciplined
People's Republic of China.

37:35.166 --> 37:36.769
And Iran is also pretty.

37:36.845 --> 37:38.629
By all accounts,
the weather there is idyllic

37:38.631 --> 37:41.274
and everyday people are offed,
because of their...

37:41.278 --> 37:42.312
for example, their views...

37:42.315 --> 37:44.020
and their sexual orientation.

37:44.045 --> 37:45.057
Thank you!

37:45.061 --> 37:47.906
Then I think I'll give the menu
another glance.

37:52.524 --> 37:54.244

37:54.286 --> 37:57.800
Could you at least give me
the recipe for a real art scandal?

37:57.824 --> 38:00.014
I'm just a nostalgic type of person.

38:00.111 --> 38:02.865
I'm sorry, but our old cook passed away
the year before last.

38:03.264 --> 38:05.703
However, I could bring you an event...

38:05.776 --> 38:08.703
...and some say,
you can't even taste the difference.

38:12.684 --> 38:15.308
<i>Oh, it's a birth simulator!</i>

38:15.441 --> 38:19.213
<i>- I blame society for Zack Snyder's career.</i>

38:19.367 --> 38:20.779
In 1914,

38:20.916 --> 38:23.546
the German Reich declared war
against Russia and France,

38:23.732 --> 38:26.113
effectively starting
World War One.

38:26.450 --> 38:30.953
The elite wanted a German Reich from
Brittany to Saint Petersburg.

38:31.197 --> 38:33.471
A lot of walking for simple soldiers.

40:32.178 --> 40:34.151
How can this be the future?

40:34.585 --> 40:37.303
That's not what <i>Blade Runner</i>
promised me.

40:45.964 --> 40:49.736
{\an8}<i>Satellite dishes,</i> YouTube™ <i>channels,</i>
Snapchat™ <i>and</i>  The Guardian™,

40:49.739 --> 40:51.209
{\an8}The Onion™, Tinder™...

40:51.601 --> 40:53.110
{\an8}<i>...you get the point.</i>

40:53.452 --> 40:56.747
{\an8}I would emphasize the fiber optic cables
that traverse the whole globe,

40:56.777 --> 40:59.291
{\an8}not only holding together
the current information economy,

40:59.366 --> 41:01.632
{\an8}but scrambling
our system of nation states.

41:02.244 --> 41:04.049
<i>Such a smart ass!</i>

41:04.994 --> 41:06.545
Ahh...hh!  Ouch!

41:07.093 --> 41:08.249
<i>Bottom line,</i>

41:08.332 --> 41:09.962
<i>media is the strongest</i>

41:09.989 --> 41:13.743
<i>political, economic and heruristic
power in the modern world.</i>

41:15.927 --> 41:18.197
<i>I own some, you own some,</i>

41:18.200 --> 41:21.769
<i>but most of it is owned by,
well... someone else.</i>

41:22.292 --> 41:25.024
Recently, I asked my friend, David Fine,

41:25.026 --> 41:27.512
to do a research study
on his lunch-break.

41:27.855 --> 41:30.635
His result suggested that
thirty-five percent of the media

41:30.639 --> 41:32.677
is owned by Mark Zuckerberg.

41:32.868 --> 41:34.545
I first offered him twenty-five euros

41:34.547 --> 41:36.886
 if he could find that
it's actually forty-five percent,

41:36.935 --> 41:38.803
but he said
nobody would believe that.

41:38.993 --> 41:41.874
We agreed on thirty-five percent
for twenty euros.

41:42.210 --> 41:44.906
David Fine completed his study
in under two minutes.

41:45.097 --> 41:46.981
Five stars.
Would buy again.

41:47.023 --> 41:49.939
<i>You see, it's redundant to talk
about fake news,</i>

41:49.941 --> 41:53.102
<i>because news is, by definition, fake.</i>

41:53.279 --> 41:54.703
<i>Ask the constructivist.</i>

41:54.770 --> 41:56.674
{\an8}That's right!

41:57.034 --> 42:01.064
<i>News is fake because it is
created and edited in a specific way,</i>

42:01.154 --> 42:04.873
<i>for a specific target group,
for a specific purpose.</i>

42:04.960 --> 42:08.319
<i>The idea of freedom of the press
and journalistic objectivity</i>

42:08.322 --> 42:10.352
<i>is strange in a world
so obviously</i>

42:10.377 --> 42:12.707
<i>based on power relationships.</i>

42:12.808 --> 42:15.035
<i>Facts used to be a driving force</i>

42:15.038 --> 42:16.864
<i>and selling point of journalism,</i>

42:16.964 --> 42:19.750
<i>but, research is expensive
and market forces</i>

42:19.793 --> 42:21.618
<i>don't care if you sell something</i>

42:21.645 --> 42:24.298
<i>because it's researched well
or faked well.</i>

42:24.514 --> 42:27.876
{\an8}Free speech!  Free speech!
Free speech!

42:28.163 --> 42:29.631
<i>"Freeze peach" ?</i>

42:29.847 --> 42:33.117
Free speech!  Free speech!
Free speech!

42:33.301 --> 42:35.239
<i>Shut your piehole!</i>

42:35.357 --> 42:37.232
<i>Who or what
do people imagine</i>

42:37.235 --> 42:39.519
<i>delivers the right to free speech?</i>

42:39.700 --> 42:41.024
<i>The question should not be</i>

42:41.026 --> 42:43.741
<i>"do you believe in free speech?"</i>

42:43.913 --> 42:45.420
<i>The question should be:</i>

42:49.480 --> 42:51.337
<i>Defending the free speech of Nazis</i>

42:51.362 --> 42:54.127
<i>doesn't guarantee
the free speech of anti-facists.</i>

42:54.186 --> 42:56.905
<i>The content of speech or
in your right to it,</i>

42:57.016 --> 42:58.550
<i>isn't what's important.</i>

42:58.622 --> 43:01.784
<i>The provision of labor, power
and social inclusion</i>

43:01.786 --> 43:04.845
<i>determines the
affordance anyone's speech is given.</i>

43:04.958 --> 43:07.507
But that means we have to
uphold the ideal of free speech for all

43:07.509 --> 43:10.705
otherwise the bourgeois state enforces its
domination and have an excuse to--

43:10.708 --> 43:12.312
<i>Smartass... again!</i>

43:12.640 --> 43:13.640
Ouch!

43:13.645 --> 43:15.586
<i>Let's not act
as if we live in a world</i>

43:15.587 --> 43:18.543
<i>where everyone
has the same free speech.</i>

43:18.711 --> 43:21.536
<i>There was no freedom of speech
in Eastern Germany,</i>

43:21.663 --> 43:23.637
<i>yet there was very
active communication  </i>

43:23.639 --> 43:25.550
<i>channels, pamphlets
and discussions,</i>

43:25.677 --> 43:27.741
<i>
all beneath the radar of the state.</i>

43:27.974 --> 43:30.148
<i>The open media world
of liberal societies</i>

43:30.150 --> 43:33.204
<i>always encouraged
free-ish speech,</i>

43:33.466 --> 43:35.999
<i>but in a way of
calming-down dissent.</i>

43:36.393 --> 43:38.914
But comedy functions as
an important--

43:39.138 --> 43:41.103
Ahh!  God damn it!

43:41.474 --> 43:44.336
<i>The oh, so wonderful heroes
of liberals,</i>

43:46.671 --> 43:48.671
<i>never really changed anything.</i>

43:49.059 --> 43:51.917
<i>Our naked emperor is still an emperor!</i>

43:52.194 --> 43:55.500
Free speech!  Free speech!
Free speech!

43:55.546 --> 43:59.108
We are a free society!
You can say whatever you want,

43:59.194 --> 44:02.524
whenever you want,
on all of the channels you want!

44:02.807 --> 44:04.088
<i>Sure!</i>

44:04.206 --> 44:07.425
<i>But it's irrelevant...  and we all know it.</i>

44:07.510 --> 44:09.799
<i>How can we find a way
to communicate</i>

44:09.824 --> 44:11.701
<i>when no one wants to listen?</i>

44:20.636 --> 44:24.826
<i>To attack normality and reality
would also mean to attack this structure,</i>

44:24.877 --> 44:26.533
<i>something folks have referred to as:</i>

44:26.535 --> 44:29.381
{\an8}<i>the semiotics of reality,  or </i>

44:29.383 --> 44:30.956
{\an8}social semantics.

44:31.123 --> 44:33.091
<i>Have you heard about
the Bechdel test?</i>

44:33.142 --> 44:34.399
No.  What's that?

44:34.622 --> 44:36.155
<i>It's a test for movies.</i>

44:42.025 --> 44:43.158
Oh, I see.

44:43.287 --> 44:45.831
So this film passes the test now?

44:45.960 --> 44:48.711
<i>Yes.  We are the token conversation.</i>

44:48.863 --> 44:50.995
Oh, that's very nice then.

44:51.035 --> 44:52.655
{\an8}<i>It's important to analyze</i>

44:52.683 --> 44:54.248
{\an8}<i>how something is represented</i>

44:54.306 --> 44:55.878
{\an8}<i>and what is not represented,</i>

44:55.880 --> 44:58.255
{\an8}<i>or how it lacks representation.</i>

44:58.485 --> 45:02.023
{\an8}<i>It is not Zuckerberg,
whose ass-holishness is not in dispute,</i>

45:02.089 --> 45:03.271
{\an8}<i>we should attack.</i>

45:03.392 --> 45:06.495
{\an8}<i>But, rather, the cultural grammar
of the public space.</i>

45:06.702 --> 45:09.450
{\an8}<i>Power is formed
within such a grammar.</i>

45:09.521 --> 45:13.625
{\an8}<i>Access and nonaccess to everything
is regulated in its realm.</i>

45:13.793 --> 45:15.893
{\an8}<i>Meanings are negotiated there.</i>

45:15.999 --> 45:18.569
{\an8}<i>Good and evil are determined.</i>

45:18.713 --> 45:20.672
{\an8}<i>It is a common reflex for
people to think</i>

45:20.680 --> 45:21.957
{\an8}<i>they are helpless against</i>

45:21.987 --> 45:24.596
{\an8}<i>almighty governments and corporate powers.</i>

45:24.709 --> 45:28.496
<i>But, power is more like an icky jellyfish,
than a solid brick wall.</i>

45:29.041 --> 45:30.505
<i>Play with it!</i>

45:30.975 --> 45:32.686
Y--yes, madame!

45:32.900 --> 45:35.694
<i>And that's how I like my pundits!</i>

46:00.461 --> 46:03.476
(whimpering)

46:15.050 --> 46:19.646
(barking)

46:23.291 --> 46:25.926
<i>We live...
in a paradoxical world.</i>

46:26.286 --> 46:29.995
<i>The largest phone providers own
no telco infrastructure.</i>

46:30.292 --> 46:34.062
<i>The most popular media
own or creates almost no content.</i>

46:34.246 --> 46:37.995
<i>The world's largest media house
owns no cinemas.</i>

46:38.094 --> 46:41.491
<i>The world's largest software vendors
create no apps.</i>

46:41.588 --> 46:43.615
<i>And so on... .</i>

46:43.807 --> 46:46.158
What is this sorcery?

46:46.445 --> 46:50.859
<i>Yet, we obviously live
in a highly material world.</i>

46:51.284 --> 46:53.269
<i>Our freedom

<i>There is no

{\an8}<i>Here's a crazy,</i>

{\an8}<i>first presented at the German

{\an8}<i>A mixture of Christian Revival attitude</i>

{\an8}<i>Quite something, isn't it Pontius?</i>

50:03.067 --> 50:06.593
I'm useless as an artist.

50:06.599 --> 50:10.333
There's nothing left to do!

50:10.572 --> 50:11.572
Oh...

50:11.864 --> 50:16.231
A video filter that makes videos
look like they're really old.

50:16.613 --> 50:19.581
This changes everything!

50:55.922 --> 50:57.048
Hey!

50:57.448 --> 50:58.538
You!

50:59.243 --> 51:00.861
Yeah, you!

51:02.145 --> 51:05.173
What?
Is someone there, you're asking.

51:05.427 --> 51:06.980
Is someone watching you?

51:07.054 --> 51:08.321
Of course there is!

51:09.244 --> 51:10.541
But don't be scared.

51:10.616 --> 51:14.243
You are my big brother.
The modern subject.

51:14.844 --> 51:15.828
I know.

51:15.830 --> 51:18.462
You haven't known me personally
since our parents

51:18.487 --> 51:21.211
Father Honor, and Mother Concern,

51:21.396 --> 51:24.915
sent you away to the
Boarding School of Bourgeois Privacy

51:24.917 --> 51:26.006
when you were young.

51:26.092 --> 51:28.815
But those years of your life are over.

51:29.050 --> 51:32.984
I'm here to pick you up
and guide you into a new tomorrow.

51:33.366 --> 51:34.833
Let me give you a hug!

51:35.814 --> 51:36.814
<i>No.</i>

51:36.966 --> 51:39.362
You miss Bourgeois Privacy?

51:40.920 --> 51:42.489
Oh, my...  my...

51:42.510 --> 51:44.370
Hey, don't cry.

51:44.916 --> 51:47.009
You say your liberty was
protected in there.

51:47.435 --> 51:48.579
You felt safe

51:48.581 --> 51:51.448
having a personal space
that felt hidden

51:51.508 --> 51:56.505
from outside
curiosities, views and disapproval.

51:57.088 --> 51:59.675
You don't understand, big brother.

51:59.941 --> 52:02.304
The privacy you've had so far,

52:02.441 --> 52:05.088
is a historical contingency...

52:05.254 --> 52:07.019
not a universal fact.

52:07.516 --> 52:09.881
You can't stay in school for ever.

52:10.043 --> 52:13.744
It's a stage in the life of
a subject, like you.

52:14.152 --> 52:18.501
See, privacy as we think of it,
is only three hundred years old.

52:18.576 --> 52:24.247
It doesn't exist in its precise
western bourgeois form in eastern cultures,

52:24.325 --> 52:27.826
but, as common goods
came to be held in fewer hands,

52:27.916 --> 52:30.491
creating separate
private and public spheres,

52:30.616 --> 52:35.819
an ever more tightly defined family
protected itself and its wealth

52:35.952 --> 52:39.560
against the street,
against the remaining population.

52:49.509 --> 52:50.590
The bourgeoisie

52:50.610 --> 52:55.037
often defined its moral superiority
over the masses of workers

52:55.371 --> 52:58.392
through the latter's lack of
proper privacy.

52:58.550 --> 53:02.278
Although, the workers simply
couldn't afford adequate living conditions.

53:02.563 --> 53:05.675
Heinrich Heine wrote
this lovely revolutionary ditty,

53:05.747 --> 53:08.836
just a couple of weeks
after the uprising of the weavers

53:08.929 --> 53:12.694
of Langenbielau and Peterswaldau
in Silesia, in 1844:

56:26.778 --> 56:29.934
They were weaving and weaving ♪

56:30.001 --> 56:32.020
and their bosses had money, ♪

56:32.079 --> 56:33.810
spare time, and... ♪

56:34.160 --> 56:35.773
privacy. ♪

56:35.958 --> 56:38.736
But privacy was
already being undermined.

56:38.898 --> 56:42.214
The technological advances toward the
end of the nineteenth century,

56:42.216 --> 56:45.199
were discussed just as much
as today's are.

56:45.469 --> 56:49.821
The telephone was dangerous
for opening the home's safe space

56:49.823 --> 56:51.723
to far away ears.

56:51.834 --> 56:53.060
X-rays were

56:53.168 --> 56:57.302
'a weapon to peek beyond walls
into the most private quarters.'

56:57.760 --> 56:58.760
Hahh...

56:58.879 --> 57:01.079
Calls for strong laws
to protect privacy

57:01.090 --> 57:04.038
against such threats
emerged, most famously

57:04.080 --> 57:06.324
in the 1890 essay:

57:06.376 --> 57:07.990
"The Right to Privacy"

57:08.090 --> 57:12.051
which is still prevalent
in privacy legislation debates.

57:12.501 --> 57:16.835
The problems were not limited to
the intrusions into individual's lives.

57:17.087 --> 57:19.939
Disrespect the line beween
public and private,

57:20.094 --> 57:22.291
and you set poor moral examples

57:22.343 --> 57:25.299
and degenerate proper public discourse.

57:25.399 --> 57:27.681
For example,
the authors warned against

57:27.732 --> 57:30.153
newspaper stories leading to

57:30.156 --> 57:33.741
improper public discussions
of private matters.

57:33.952 --> 57:36.236
Such stories can matter to the demos

57:36.263 --> 57:39.780
and become a matter of politics.

57:39.847 --> 57:40.747
<i>Hmm...</i>

57:40.794 --> 57:42.044
In the twentieth century,

57:42.227 --> 57:43.227
liberal democracies

57:43.282 --> 57:47.837
promoted privacy as a liberal counter
against populist doctrines,

57:48.019 --> 57:50.203
be they communist or fascist.

57:50.300 --> 57:52.113
This period was also

57:52.242 --> 57:55.449
when the welfare capitalism of
liberal democracies,

57:55.489 --> 57:59.249
through their surpluses
from colonialism or imperialism,

57:59.299 --> 58:02.747
raised the living standards
of most of their populace.

58:02.874 --> 58:06.333
The so called 'middle class'
had privacy too,

58:06.358 --> 58:10.405
but, these very economic conditions
enabled marginalized parts of

58:10.463 --> 58:15.060
bourgeois society to think
about the good and the bad of privacy.

58:15.226 --> 58:18.830
Feminist activists used drastic
publicity tactics

58:18.912 --> 58:20.726
to start discussions of issues

58:20.878 --> 58:23.197
formerly hidden by privacy and taboo.

58:23.263 --> 58:25.472
For example,
in France and Germany,

58:25.562 --> 58:27.638
they started public mass confessions

58:27.640 --> 58:31.945
involving prominent women stating:
'we had abortions.'

58:32.107 --> 58:35.494
Similar tacts were used by
homosexual activists.

58:36.051 --> 58:37.231
Oh.  Eh...

58:37.622 --> 58:38.978
I got carried away.

58:39.583 --> 58:40.783
What did you say, big brother?

58:40.867 --> 58:45.068
Oh, eh, it's not all bad...
especially for marginalized groups.

58:45.096 --> 58:49.730
It is useful to have space
free from authoritarian eyes.

58:50.010 --> 58:51.981
{\an8}But privacy is under attack.

58:52.075 --> 58:54.403
{\an8}This time, the troubles
might be terminal,

58:54.589 --> 58:58.353
{\an8}along with probably so many other troubles
of bourgeois political economy.

58:58.897 --> 59:01.714
Dear big brother,
put in your earbuds.

59:02.369 --> 59:05.164
Here is an interesting song
from the 1970s,

59:05.258 --> 59:09.179
It's called <i>Die Nummer,</i>
by:   Info Music Bamberg.

59:09.348 --> 59:13.760
This song is a great example of
middle class angst at the

59:13.963 --> 59:17.504
♪ dawning of the age of computer-is ♪

59:18.569 --> 59:20.347
Sorry, just listen to the song:

01:00:04.477 --> 01:00:08.641
Our lives are being rewired to form
one global infrastructure,

01:00:08.650 --> 01:00:11.643
that works on the basis of
our information.

01:00:13.374 --> 01:00:15.441
(chickens clucking)

01:00:27.094 --> 01:00:30.547
Privacy is not under attack by
some evil outside forces,

01:00:30.621 --> 01:00:33.954
it's under attack
by our own collective behavior.

01:00:34.088 --> 01:00:37.795
These trends could be stopped
only by massive efforts.

01:00:38.166 --> 01:00:40.147
People wouldn't be able
to share stuff online.

01:00:40.163 --> 01:00:44.426
<i>Mongolian barbecue is neither
Mongolian nor barbecue.</i>

01:00:44.903 --> 01:00:48.310
We would have to get rid
of the internet as we know it.

01:00:48.671 --> 01:00:50.863
But you don't want to do that.
Right?

01:00:51.370 --> 01:00:53.116
You'd  make the right choice,

01:00:53.351 --> 01:00:54.576
wouldn't you, big brother?

01:00:54.783 --> 01:00:57.183
You wouldn't sacrifice
memes and...

01:00:57.871 --> 01:00:58.871
porn

01:00:58.999 --> 01:01:00.849
for bourgeois privacy?

01:01:01.141 --> 01:01:02.313
Right?

01:01:03.327 --> 01:01:05.057
Our information is out there.

01:01:05.377 --> 01:01:06.644
It's not by choice.

01:01:07.043 --> 01:01:09.305
It's a necessary entanglement

01:01:09.395 --> 01:01:12.841
and it's adding up to
something big and beautiful...

01:01:13.342 --> 01:01:15.721
presupposing we take the right actions.

01:01:16.021 --> 01:01:20.920
If nice things are being made on the basis
of mass data collection and utilization,

01:01:21.070 --> 01:01:22.599
you should have those things.

01:01:22.849 --> 01:01:24.313
The problem isn't data.

01:01:24.421 --> 01:01:29.133
It's the power relations
that lie behind the data and its use.

01:01:29.446 --> 01:01:34.829
Our liberty depends on factors
other than the secrecy of our actions.

01:01:35.128 --> 01:01:38.554
You wouldn't hide your weed
from Father Honor and Mother Concern

01:01:38.556 --> 01:01:41.864
if they didn't still have
some power over you, right?

01:01:42.212 --> 01:01:46.595
Institutions might be forced
into greater efficiency and honesty

01:01:46.705 --> 01:01:48.923
if all corruption were to leak out.

01:01:49.115 --> 01:01:51.387
Actually, this process is already starting.

01:01:51.524 --> 01:01:53.722
Think of WikiLeaks and Edward Snowden.

01:01:53.747 --> 01:01:55.647
<i>There's a cool game,
it's called:</i>

01:01:55.702 --> 01:01:59.134
<i>'don't think about Julian Assange
molesting a chicken.'</i>

01:01:59.276 --> 01:02:00.414
<i>You lost.</i>

01:02:00.504 --> 01:02:02.588
<i>I got the weirdest boner.</i>

01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:05.634
A democratization of surveillance

01:02:05.716 --> 01:02:08.157
would allow it to be
turned against the powerful.

01:02:08.507 --> 01:02:13.116
Post-privacy will be difficult, though,
if the playing field isn't level,

01:02:13.225 --> 01:02:16.887
if information is released,
but the same groups have the power.

01:02:17.242 --> 01:02:19.032
But if we hold the information,

01:02:19.153 --> 01:02:20.716
if we decide how it's used,

01:02:20.770 --> 01:02:23.684
given how important it is to
everything that happens today,

01:02:23.899 --> 01:02:26.902
we can settle historical
power imbalances.

01:02:27.159 --> 01:02:28.159
See,

01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:29.422
I'm not the state,

01:02:29.574 --> 01:02:33.374
or Wall Street, or
the servers of silicon valley.

01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:35.255
I'm little brother.

01:02:35.861 --> 01:02:38.492
I own no means of production,

01:02:38.620 --> 01:02:41.662
except all of the information I have
about you and your friends.

01:02:41.806 --> 01:02:44.902
What we need today
is a network, a platform, or

01:02:45.028 --> 01:02:48.810
some equivalent institution
of little brothers,  like me,

01:02:48.998 --> 01:02:51.720
who have no monopoly
over violence,

01:02:51.817 --> 01:02:54.349
power over your credit rating, or

01:02:54.583 --> 01:02:56.273
ownership of your debt.

01:02:56.361 --> 01:03:00.689
My sole power rests on having
all this data.

01:03:01.154 --> 01:03:03.287
But I'm not alienated
from you.

01:03:03.493 --> 01:03:04.845
I'm on your side.

01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:09.511
So let's attack the forces
that make us fear for the loss of privacy

01:03:09.589 --> 01:03:10.848
at their roots.

01:03:10.954 --> 01:03:15.651
Because we have the core productive
force of the day in our hands,

01:03:15.874 --> 01:03:19.617
we can take these forces on...
together.

01:03:31.177 --> 01:03:34.086
I once met a
pansexual German paratrooper

01:03:34.088 --> 01:03:37.232
who thought Michael Haneke
is totally overrated.

01:03:37.353 --> 01:03:38.484
Clever fellow.

01:03:38.598 --> 01:03:42.064
He invited me to check out
Vienna's Museum of Natural History.

01:03:42.275 --> 01:03:45.168
I joined him and
he told me an interesting story.

01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:46.987
In 1952,

01:03:47.046 --> 01:03:49.415
Austrian big game hunter in Africa,

01:03:49.512 --> 01:03:50.921
researcher,

01:03:51.015 --> 01:03:52.437
Ernst Zwillinge,

01:03:52.543 --> 01:03:55.494
colonial revisionist,
a member of the Nazi party;

01:03:55.615 --> 01:03:58.824
brought a male chimpanzee
from Cameroon to Schonbrunn,

01:03:58.890 --> 01:04:00.290
the Viennese zoo.

01:04:00.385 --> 01:04:03.448
In his African home, Honzo
had reportedly been

01:04:03.450 --> 01:04:05.240
a friendly and likable animal.

01:04:05.277 --> 01:04:08.503
But in the zoo,
he began to show a violent temper.

01:04:08.632 --> 01:04:10.632
Due to his choleric outbreaks,

01:04:10.667 --> 01:04:13.967
poor Honzo was kept
in solitary confinement.

01:04:14.053 --> 01:04:16.824
The chimpanzee was given
beer and cigarettes.

01:04:17.054 --> 01:04:20.608
He got addicted, and died
an alcoholic and chain-smoker.

01:04:21.056 --> 01:04:23.542
After his death,
the chimp was taxidermed

01:04:23.628 --> 01:04:25.874
and put into the
Museum of Natural History.

01:04:26.175 --> 01:04:29.303
Now people from all over the world
stare at him.

01:04:29.722 --> 01:04:31.955
That's gotta be
an allegory for something.

01:09:27.867 --> 01:09:30.461
"There is no such thing as men.

01:09:30.596 --> 01:09:33.352
"I have seen Frenchmen, Italians,

01:09:33.426 --> 01:09:34.662
"and Russians.

01:09:34.853 --> 01:09:35.933
"As for men,

01:09:36.319 --> 01:09:39.321
I have never come across
<i>him</i> anywhere."

01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:47.655
<i>Occupied by</i>  Occupy Bathroom.

01:11:47.831 --> 01:11:49.069
Fuck!

01:11:49.729 --> 01:11:51.667
Das 'Lied der Arbeit,'

01:11:51.842 --> 01:11:53.149
 the 'Song of Work,'

01:11:53.153 --> 01:11:56.439
was first presented
to the world in 1868.

01:11:56.712 --> 01:12:00.479
It is the official anthem
of Austrian Social Democracy.

01:12:00.803 --> 01:12:05.325
♪  And I say to thee,
what the fuckity fuck?  ♪

01:12:05.443 --> 01:12:07.923
It's such a
horrendous fetishization of work.

01:12:08.016 --> 01:12:10.833
I want to puke
and build a factory out of it.

01:12:11.113 --> 01:12:16.150
Let's listen to an interpretation by
Mira Sophia Ulz, from 2009.

01:12:16.396 --> 01:12:20.814
Mira won the Austrian Kiddie Contest,
a song contest for young singers.

01:12:20.861 --> 01:12:24.889
And so the Social Democrats invited her
to celebrate with them.

01:12:25.190 --> 01:12:26.990
Not sure she deserved that... .

01:12:27.682 --> 01:12:31.290
I asked <i>wobblersound</i>
to create the proper remix.

01:14:10.890 --> 01:14:13.279
(manaical laughter)

01:14:13.567 --> 01:14:14.567
Mmm.

01:14:15.129 --> 01:14:17.594
Democracy.  Mmm.

01:14:18.245 --> 01:14:21.100
One ruling form
that rules them all.

01:14:21.935 --> 01:14:24.527
The young adult novel
of governmental systems:

01:14:24.747 --> 01:14:27.262
it does't work,
but, people still go with it.

01:14:27.914 --> 01:14:30.877
Every couple of years
we vote for our representatives.

01:14:31.001 --> 01:14:33.923
Yet, the rest of our lives
is very undemocratic.

01:14:34.208 --> 01:14:35.813
Work life is no democracy,

01:14:35.910 --> 01:14:37.510
sports are undemocratic,

01:14:37.638 --> 01:14:39.108
art isn't democratic,

01:14:39.329 --> 01:14:41.087
and, just as a nudge:

01:14:41.231 --> 01:14:44.165
imagine NASA is planning
a mission to Mars.

01:14:44.306 --> 01:14:47.957
Do you believe a democratic process
will determine who goes on that mission?

01:14:48.149 --> 01:14:52.007
They won't waste billions of dollars
sending unqualified personnel.

01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:54.240
They will peer fuckin' review it.

01:14:54.378 --> 01:14:55.291
The question is,

01:14:55.294 --> 01:14:58.229
why do we use democracy
to run nations?

01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:00.760
The answer, you might imagine, is:

01:15:00.957 --> 01:15:02.713
if you believe you have power,

01:15:02.862 --> 01:15:04.846
you don't challenge power.

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:08.245
Let's have a look at a specific
subgenre of democracy:

01:15:11.601 --> 01:15:13.214
It is 1926.

01:15:13.288 --> 01:15:15.647
Erich Mühsam dedicates
the lyrics of

01:15:15.761 --> 01:15:16.971
the upcoming song

01:15:17.044 --> 01:15:20.381
to the leading cadre of the
German Social Democratic movement,

01:15:20.549 --> 01:15:23.388
because they're constantly
collaborating with police,

01:15:23.458 --> 01:15:26.554
justice, military, and administration.

01:15:26.811 --> 01:15:30.270
The Social Democrats were thus
supporting and perpetuating

01:15:30.552 --> 01:15:33.355
the societal order
of the German Empire.

01:15:33.858 --> 01:15:35.091
Enough said.

01:17:04.289 --> 01:17:07.424
Maybe Social Democracy
learned from its failures.

01:17:08.375 --> 01:17:13.290
{\an8}Let's visit a meeting in the
nation of Sirkennethbranaghkhgkia,

01:17:13.552 --> 01:17:16.575
{\an8}the state that owes its name
to lack of creativity.

01:17:16.852 --> 01:17:21.931
{\an8}Anyways, the newly elected president,
Ödem von Horvath sits at his desk,

01:17:22.159 --> 01:17:23.762
{\an8}two advisors beside him...

01:17:23.945 --> 01:17:26.545
{\an8}Biological Male
and Biological Female.

01:17:26.741 --> 01:17:27.741
<i>Emmhh!</i>

01:17:27.968 --> 01:17:29.663
<i>I sure hope the hot water
is working soon.</i>

01:17:29.726 --> 01:17:31.689
I'm sure it will be,
Mr. President.

01:17:31.909 --> 01:17:34.507
<i>Okay, so,
what's on the agenda?</i>

01:17:35.855 --> 01:17:38.235
We promised free healthcare,

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:40.427
free education, wage increases,

01:17:40.502 --> 01:17:42.162
two months paid vacation,

01:17:42.212 --> 01:17:44.667
strong housing and
transportation programs

01:17:44.725 --> 01:17:46.298
and more.
<i>- Superb!</i>

01:17:46.375 --> 01:17:47.670
<i>Shouldn't be a problem, right?</i>

01:17:47.728 --> 01:17:49.234
<i>Just tax the rich!</i>

01:17:49.462 --> 01:17:52.495
- Well, to do that, we must first
have a robust economy,

01:17:52.632 --> 01:17:53.911
with a thriving private sector

01:17:53.914 --> 01:17:55.834
that enjoys production and
marketing advantages

01:17:55.836 --> 01:17:57.540
over the economies of other nations.

01:17:57.571 --> 01:17:58.995
<i>Ah!
Is that so?</i>

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:00.886
- Let's model it out.
- Mmm.

01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:09.286
<i>♪ Halleluja ♪</i>

01:18:14.659 --> 01:18:16.637
<i>So, more for us.</i>

01:18:17.171 --> 01:18:18.171
<i>This is how, right?</i>

01:18:18.895 --> 01:18:23.141
<i>More for our companies
in market share and profits.</i>

01:18:23.145 --> 01:18:24.404
- Yes.

01:18:24.672 --> 01:18:25.607
<i>Eh!</i>

01:18:25.609 --> 01:18:27.275
<i>Oh, why isn't it working?</i>

01:18:27.663 --> 01:18:28.886
- I can't say.

01:18:29.389 --> 01:18:31.946
In the 1950s and '60s--

01:18:31.949 --> 01:18:34.062
<i>You mean the
golden age of capitalism?</i>

01:18:34.134 --> 01:18:36.792
Oh, yes!

01:18:37.545 --> 01:18:40.502
- Um, but to go on...  then it was easy!

01:18:40.508 --> 01:18:43.206
Other world economies
weren't as good.

01:18:43.476 --> 01:18:45.790
Ah! Our firms could
easily outcompete them.

01:18:45.997 --> 01:18:48.370
But, in the 1970s,
the rest of the world

01:18:48.375 --> 01:18:51.000
started to catch-up
and need an increased money supply.

01:18:51.104 --> 01:18:55.056
So the system of fixed exchange rates
around the dollar was gutted.

01:18:55.256 --> 01:18:58.358
Increases in oil prices
destabilized the system further.

01:18:58.435 --> 01:19:01.619
And companies struggling against
national competitions

01:19:01.622 --> 01:19:04.503
withdrew from their
compromise with labor.

01:19:04.859 --> 01:19:06.929
I don't know what
we can do now,  though.

01:19:07.286 --> 01:19:08.841
Mmm.
<i>- Hahh!</i>

01:19:09.054 --> 01:19:10.187
<i>I've got an idea.</i>

01:19:10.613 --> 01:19:12.032
<i>We could put a pump</i>

01:19:12.454 --> 01:19:14.683
<i>in the other parts of this...</i>

01:19:14.851 --> 01:19:17.561
congealed labor it is...
very precious.

01:19:17.650 --> 01:19:22.639
- Congealed labor is the amount of labor
intangibly present in a commodity,

01:19:22.729 --> 01:19:27.141
which in the market is roughly expressed
as exchange value, or 'price.'

01:19:27.325 --> 01:19:29.113
- Marvel of capitalism, really,

01:19:29.304 --> 01:19:32.707
allows innovators such as ourselves,
to model the world

01:19:32.883 --> 01:19:37.844
before it is directly lived
as an accumulation of representation.

01:19:37.917 --> 01:19:39.751
<i>Yes.  Very good.</i>

01:19:39.881 --> 01:19:44.035
<i>We can put a pump in
congealed labor that isn't ours</i>

01:19:44.133 --> 01:19:45.262
<i>and we can just...</i>

01:19:45.521 --> 01:19:48.697
<i> throw away some congealed labor
from other parts of the world.</i>

01:19:48.756 --> 01:19:49.908
- Excellent idea!

01:19:50.053 --> 01:19:54.401
Ah, just make sure what we do doesn't
look like colonialism or imperialism,

01:19:54.406 --> 01:19:57.474
that really alienates those millennials
from our party.

01:19:57.563 --> 01:19:58.655
<i>Of course!</i>

01:19:58.745 --> 01:20:00.958
<i>And it's clear how it can be done!</i>

01:20:01.493 --> 01:20:03.791
<i>I'll call China and India,</i>

01:20:03.881 --> 01:20:05.332
<i>and all the other countries,</i>

01:20:05.379 --> 01:20:08.606
<i>and bid them, in a spirit of
international cooperation</i>

01:20:08.675 --> 01:20:11.731
<i>to funnel their congealed labor to us</i>

01:20:11.921 --> 01:20:14.400
<i>and to become banded
to a global economy.</i>

01:20:14.515 --> 01:20:16.224
Tha--that probably won't work.

01:20:16.428 --> 01:20:18.769
- Yeah...   n-no.

01:20:18.886 --> 01:20:21.533
Mr. Xioping and the
Communist Party of China,

01:20:21.626 --> 01:20:24.885
are very committed to the ethos
of the Treaty of Nanjing.

01:20:25.334 --> 01:20:29.365
Hhh!   They feel they must uphold
uncompromising free trade.

01:20:29.507 --> 01:20:32.551
- And, Mr. Moody, we've been trying
to get in touch with him all day,

01:20:32.553 --> 01:20:34.477
but his phone is always
in airplane mode.

01:20:34.518 --> 01:20:37.759
<i>Then how are we supposed to
strengthen our economy?</i>

01:20:37.861 --> 01:20:40.578
- Discipline and social hierarchies.

01:20:40.968 --> 01:20:43.322
We can make our consumers
buy our goods,

01:20:43.396 --> 01:20:46.967
if we return to the production paradigm
of the 1950s.

01:20:47.129 --> 01:20:49.298
White men get paychecks,

01:20:49.372 --> 01:20:51.910
granting a certain standard of living
to their families.

01:20:52.482 --> 01:20:54.507
In return for not only work,

01:20:54.748 --> 01:20:57.281
but society itself being factory-like,

01:20:57.577 --> 01:21:02.044
no unruly behavior, so women...
back in the semiautomated kitchen.

01:21:02.438 --> 01:21:03.438
Please!

01:21:03.827 --> 01:21:05.511
- Oh, this isn't working!

01:21:05.593 --> 01:21:08.330
They're protesting against
assembly line production norms

01:21:08.332 --> 01:21:10.559
and not working hard at all!

01:21:10.695 --> 01:21:11.823
Ahh!  They've become used

01:21:11.825 --> 01:21:14.364
to the flexibility and autonomy
they have...

01:21:14.409 --> 01:21:15.695
...limited as they are.

01:21:15.750 --> 01:21:17.165
<i>Oh, damn it all!</i>

01:21:17.313 --> 01:21:19.725
<i>I'm just going to tax the rich,
they'll cough it up!</i>

01:21:20.124 --> 01:21:21.221
<i>Here, let me text them.</i>

01:21:23.819 --> 01:21:25.909
(vibrating cell phone)

01:21:42.288 --> 01:21:43.934
Bad news, Mr. President.

01:21:44.061 --> 01:21:46.405
<i>Well, we've got the money to
solve the problem now.</i>

01:21:46.509 --> 01:21:47.931
- Maybe not, see!

01:21:48.056 --> 01:21:52.864
Industrialists, venture capitalists,
tech C.E.O.s, and bankers

01:21:52.931 --> 01:21:57.369
have all moved more capital to places with
lower taxes than what you're proposing.

01:21:57.391 --> 01:22:00.847
Hhh!  They've invested more money
in artificial intelligence

01:22:00.849 --> 01:22:03.091
so they don't have to pay
living wages!

01:22:04.051 --> 01:22:08.545
- Anyway, people were spending their
increased wages on cheap foreign goods.

01:22:08.632 --> 01:22:09.966
And, and, and, and, an...

01:22:09.968 --> 01:22:13.061
with our domestic companies
over capacity,

01:22:13.166 --> 01:22:15.763
investors are speculating
in risky tech...

01:22:15.814 --> 01:22:16.850
...and finance,

01:22:16.878 --> 01:22:19.928
then they can move
even more as--

01:22:21.031 --> 01:22:23.052
more assets away from us.

01:22:23.232 --> 01:22:24.620
<i>How could they?!</i>

01:22:24.622 --> 01:22:25.888
They can do
whatever they want.

01:22:25.939 --> 01:22:27.751
They... they...

01:22:28.522 --> 01:22:31.855
(jointly)
They still own the means of production!

01:22:32.062 --> 01:22:34.629
(laughter and applause)

01:22:37.044 --> 01:22:40.895
The following song is
a parody of the Horst-Wessel-Lied,

01:22:41.123 --> 01:22:43.481
The anthem of
the German Nazi Party,

01:22:43.567 --> 01:22:47.485
from 1930 to 1945.

01:22:47.616 --> 01:22:49.918
it was sung at
every fuckin' occassion,

01:22:49.937 --> 01:22:54.599
but, during the Third Reich, the song
was parodied in underground versions,

01:22:54.665 --> 01:22:57.468
 poking fun at the
corruption of the Nazi elite.

01:22:57.783 --> 01:23:00.434
Well, there are similarities
between different texts,

01:23:00.493 --> 01:23:03.752
as underground authors developed
them with variations...

01:23:03.827 --> 01:23:06.406
but here is my favorite!:

01:24:25.430 --> 01:24:28.395
<i>At long last,
we've arrived at the left.</i>

01:24:28.720 --> 01:24:30.279
<i>I'm so happy!</i>

01:24:30.509 --> 01:24:32.509
<i>Thanks for pushing me to come.</i>

01:24:33.351 --> 01:24:34.374
<b>Professor!</b>

01:24:34.406 --> 01:24:39.188
<b>What is a member of the burghertudinus
bourgeoisie doing here on the left</b>

01:24:39.337 --> 01:24:40.401
<b>of that peak?</b>

01:24:40.869 --> 01:24:42.006
<i>Peculiar!</i>

01:24:42.735 --> 01:24:44.289
<b>He seems Swedish.</b>

01:24:44.406 --> 01:24:46.807
<b>We should kick him
in the iron balls.</b>

01:24:46.923 --> 01:24:47.923
<i>Okay.</i>

01:24:48.222 --> 01:24:51.230
<i>First, I will
kindly asks him to leave.</i>

01:24:52.503 --> 01:24:53.599
<i>Hello good sir!</i>

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.951
<i>This is the fabled 'Realm of Left.'</i>

01:24:57.048 --> 01:24:58.486
<i>The side of labor.</i>

01:24:58.637 --> 01:25:00.873
<i>You are our enemy.</i>

01:25:01.363 --> 01:25:02.614
Well, how're you doin' there?

01:25:02.697 --> 01:25:04.089
I'm Sven Shitpornson.

01:25:04.225 --> 01:25:06.543
<b>- I knew it! I knew it!
He's Swedish!</b>

01:25:06.719 --> 01:25:08.545
<i>- Oh, no, I'm from Windsor.</i>

01:25:08.686 --> 01:25:10.359
<b>- When the revolution comes,</b>

01:25:10.603 --> 01:25:12.884
<b>you will be the
first against the wall.</b>

01:25:13.232 --> 01:25:16.071
- Oh well now,  wait a minute there,
I don't mean no harm, you know.

01:25:16.175 --> 01:25:17.600
No. Okay. Yeah,

01:25:17.690 --> 01:25:19.140
I might be a traitor to my kind,

01:25:19.278 --> 01:25:21.553
and I know this is the left,
but I'm here to help ya.

01:25:21.914 --> 01:25:22.874
<i>Help?</i>

01:25:23.092 --> 01:25:25.764
Yeah!  Yeah, you know,
I'm an entrepeneur.

01:25:25.942 --> 01:25:26.970
I want to go make stuff.

01:25:26.973 --> 01:25:28.273
I want to create and--

01:25:28.318 --> 01:25:30.409
Don't let this big bag
of money here fool ya now.

01:25:30.434 --> 01:25:31.402
I'm not a capitalist.

01:25:35.525 --> 01:25:37.061
You know,
I'm just excited to make stuff,

01:25:37.104 --> 01:25:40.242
but my company, there, it's owned by
investors and a managerial board.

01:25:40.349 --> 01:25:41.572
And they're owned by banks,

01:25:41.574 --> 01:25:43.824
which are also then owned
by managerial boards

01:25:43.849 --> 01:25:44.955
and by investors, and...

01:25:45.178 --> 01:25:47.511
I realize now
that today, finally,

01:25:52.909 --> 01:25:54.697
It's in the form of
that there th, th,

01:25:57.463 --> 01:25:59.248
<b>- I am confused!</b>

01:25:59.512 --> 01:26:00.578
Eh, follow me.

01:26:01.558 --> 01:26:03.558
<i>My name is Lady Unsquaredance.</i>

01:26:03.796 --> 01:26:06.933
<i>I like to watch classics,
such as</i>  The Lawn Mower Man...

01:26:07.015 --> 01:26:08.482
<i>and I teach economics.</i>

01:26:08.810 --> 01:26:09.810
<i>- Ehhh...</i>

01:26:10.767 --> 01:26:15.897
<i>- Due to the competitive stresses created
since the 1970s in global capital,</i>

01:26:24.891 --> 01:26:27.387
<i>It's almost as if
banks and investors are</i>

01:26:29.518 --> 01:26:30.780
<i>extracting rent.</i>

01:26:31.367 --> 01:26:34.545
<i>Mr. Shitpornson
wants access to more capital,</i>

01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:36.739
<i>but these landlords
won't spare it.</i>

01:26:36.959 --> 01:26:41.184
Oh, yeah, yeah, that and that theres,
that's hardly the capitalism that I love.

01:26:41.396 --> 01:26:43.245
<i>He thought the left could free him,</i>

01:26:43.428 --> 01:26:46.213
<i>but it's protesting statues
and other symbols</i>

01:26:46.275 --> 01:26:49.169
<i>and how few women
sit in boardrooms,</i>

01:26:49.304 --> 01:26:51.738
<i>not about what people
in boardrooms do.</i>

01:26:51.984 --> 01:26:55.049
<i>But I've set-up a meeting
with a bright, young idea man.</i>

01:26:55.377 --> 01:26:57.136
And that's me!

01:26:57.243 --> 01:27:00.845
Hello, I'm Billy Bob Turingengine
and who are these two?

01:27:01.145 --> 01:27:02.438
<i>Let's just say</i>

01:27:02.443 --> 01:27:06.624
<i>we're true
working class revolutionaries.</i>

01:27:08.313 --> 01:27:11.685
(chuckles) And when is this
glorious revolution taking place?

01:27:11.946 --> 01:27:14.906
<i>Once we build
the power of the people.</i>

01:27:15.267 --> 01:27:16.954
(laughs)

01:27:18.109 --> 01:27:20.572
This nostalgia
for schemes and slogans,

01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:22.918
withered on a
century-old deathbed.

01:27:23.059 --> 01:27:28.004
<b>- Bah!  Cynics like you are
why we will never have communism.</b>

01:27:28.068 --> 01:27:29.068
-Mmmh.

01:27:32.566 --> 01:27:34.273
That sounds wonderful!

01:27:34.673 --> 01:27:36.633
But material conditions indicate

01:27:36.668 --> 01:27:39.377
capitalism, socialism and communism

01:27:39.561 --> 01:27:41.298
need to be reevaluated,

01:27:41.420 --> 01:27:43.392
 and maybe all discarded.

01:27:43.548 --> 01:27:44.789
- All what?

01:27:44.899 --> 01:27:47.621
- Follow me, and I will explain.

01:27:48.254 --> 01:27:49.419
I'm an engineer.

01:27:49.733 --> 01:27:51.784
but like an artist, or data analyst,

01:27:56.958 --> 01:27:58.650
If you have a concrete object,

01:27:58.794 --> 01:27:59.924
like a hammer,

01:28:00.115 --> 01:28:02.356
I can't have and use it
while you do.

01:28:02.700 --> 01:28:05.104
But if you have anything that
can be copyrighted,

01:28:07.281 --> 01:28:09.791
I can have and use it
while you do too.

01:28:14.489 --> 01:28:17.914
<i>Making traditional leftism irrelevent?</i>

01:28:18.309 --> 01:28:21.174
Information makes
the world go 'round now.

01:28:21.326 --> 01:28:23.520
Physical production
still exists, of course, but

01:28:29.835 --> 01:28:32.125
Companies like Uber® or Amazon®
succeed because

01:28:35.814 --> 01:28:41.831
<i>Oh, so platforms are institutions
as important today as markets and states.</i>

01:28:42.184 --> 01:28:43.229
Correct.

01:28:43.231 --> 01:28:44.849
- Oh, well, okay,

01:28:44.980 --> 01:28:47.703
but, ah, then how does that there
hold the system together?

01:28:54.534 --> 01:28:56.376
and they sell that
to advertisers.

01:28:56.967 --> 01:28:59.376
So many bright people I went
to college with,

01:28:59.553 --> 01:29:02.475
spent dozens of hours a week
figuring out how to make people

01:29:05.074 --> 01:29:06.350
A lucky few

01:29:06.558 --> 01:29:08.196
do something more obvious.

01:29:14.143 --> 01:29:17.628
<i>Yes, capitalism is so weak today</i>

01:29:17.779 --> 01:29:20.195
<i>that it needs the stuff
to stay afloat.</i>

01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:22.114
Okay, so then most

01:29:36.302 --> 01:29:38.584
<i>So, what's going on today is</i>

01:29:40.616 --> 01:29:43.106
- Yes!  A lot of profit still derives

01:29:43.149 --> 01:29:45.694
from extraction
of surplus value from labor.

01:29:50.861 --> 01:29:53.951
Because the private information industry's
products can be

01:30:01.288 --> 01:30:03.162
<b>- So, what's the task today?!</b>

01:30:09.787 --> 01:30:13.167
<i>and use them
for useful production?</i>

01:30:13.272 --> 01:30:14.429
You've got it.

01:30:14.492 --> 01:30:17.569
<b>- But I repair portable toilets.</b>

01:30:17.800 --> 01:30:19.713
Yet you work with information.

01:30:19.849 --> 01:30:21.642
The most strategic place
to focus is on

01:30:26.390 --> 01:30:29.280
<i>So, what do we do with the left?</i>

01:30:29.598 --> 01:30:32.063
- To hell with them!
Arrgh!

01:30:32.472 --> 01:30:36.027
Time is critical! My ship's docked.
We need to think of

01:30:40.881 --> 01:30:41.881
Arrgh!

01:30:41.953 --> 01:30:43.964
<i>- (gasps)  Is that mutiny?</i>

01:30:44.333 --> 01:30:45.333
- Nah!

01:30:45.468 --> 01:30:48.555
We have to be the ship,
not mutineers!

01:30:48.714 --> 01:30:50.914
<i>-  Well, what are we waiting for?</i>

01:30:51.289 --> 01:30:52.469
<i>Let's go!</i>

01:30:52.622 --> 01:30:53.622
<i>- Yes!</i>

01:30:54.005 --> 01:30:56.149
- And, as you're Austrian landlubber,

01:30:56.515 --> 01:30:57.800
anchors aweigh!

01:30:58.195 --> 01:30:59.570
<b>- He's Austrian?</b>

01:30:59.692 --> 01:31:01.324
<b>How awful!</b>

01:31:01.450 --> 01:31:04.258
The ultimate broken dream,

01:31:04.358 --> 01:31:06.661
is the left itself.

01:31:07.318 --> 01:31:09.821
Ehh!  We have to do this again.

01:31:09.844 --> 01:31:11.595
It's ah... it needs more pathos.

01:31:11.600 --> 01:31:15.991
It needs more... more drive, like, like 
<b>the ultimate broken dream</b>

01:31:16.023 --> 01:31:18.615
<b>is the left itself!!</b>
Okay?

01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:21.426
So,  <i>(cell phone rings)</i>
do it again, okay?

01:31:22.870 --> 01:31:24.513
<i>- Hey!    Hey!
Hey!</i>

01:31:25.001 --> 01:31:26.551
- What?
<i>- He's-he's on the phone,</i>

01:31:26.554 --> 01:31:27.554
<i>it's-it's urgent!</i>

01:31:27.560 --> 01:31:29.179
Oh,  can we finish this here?

01:31:29.181 --> 01:31:30.433
I-I'll call him back.

01:31:30.578 --> 01:31:32.304
<i>But he says you need to stop.</i>

01:31:32.396 --> 01:31:33.396
What?

01:31:33.725 --> 01:31:34.725
What?

01:31:35.812 --> 01:31:36.812
Ah,

01:31:37.234 --> 01:31:38.492
Hel-hello!

01:31:38.769 --> 01:31:40.045
Hi!  Good to speak to you!
Hey!

01:31:40.226 --> 01:31:42.668
<i>Shut up you incompetent schlong!</i>

01:31:42.941 --> 01:31:43.911
<i>You're done!</i>

01:31:43.936 --> 01:31:45.306
What, what?
<i>- It's over.</i>

01:31:45.350 --> 01:31:46.422
N-no! Ah...

01:31:46.626 --> 01:31:48.936
We-we were just recording this here
and...

01:31:49.087 --> 01:31:51.472
Ishan had this great idea
for-for the end scene.

01:31:51.552 --> 01:31:54.721
<i>I don't care,
you're way over budget!</i>

01:31:54.795 --> 01:31:58.859
<i>My budget, and more important,
my investors' budget.</i>

01:31:59.206 --> 01:32:01.031
<i>Hasta luego.</i>

01:32:01.191 --> 01:32:04.941
Well, I-I-I'm recording
my, my, my conclusion here, and...

01:32:05.082 --> 01:32:07.367
and we need money
for-for the licensing fee

01:32:07.370 --> 01:32:08.856
for-for the end credit song.

01:32:09.137 --> 01:32:11.496
<i>End credit my ass!</i>

01:32:11.775 --> 01:32:14.659
What?  What? Hey!  No, no!
Hey! What, no!

01:32:14.822 --> 01:32:16.077
No!  No!  Hey!

01:32:17.038 --> 01:32:18.427
Fuck!!  Aah!!!

01:32:19.842 --> 01:32:21.745
(exclaims in German)

01:32:23.305 --> 01:32:24.305
Ahh!

01:32:54.810 --> 01:32:56.096
Ah!  Ah.

01:36:55.554 --> 01:36:58.521
(cell phone rings)

01:37:00.925 --> 01:37:03.825
Hello Juan.
Ah, you found me, great!

01:37:04.560 --> 01:37:06.123
How much money
did you want?

01:37:07.434 --> 01:37:08.434
Twenty euros?

01:37:09.385 --> 01:37:10.472
Come on.

01:37:11.138 --> 01:37:12.304
You did what?

01:37:12.871 --> 01:37:14.642
You ate him?!

01:37:15.578 --> 01:37:16.978
(laughs)

01:37:17.830 --> 01:37:20.053
(applause and cheering)
