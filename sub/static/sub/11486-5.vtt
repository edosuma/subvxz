00:01.520 --> 00:04.159
- Have any homework this weekend?
- A little.

00:04.320 --> 00:06.390
Why don't you
get started on it tonight.

00:06.560 --> 00:07.629
But it's only Friday.

00:07.800 --> 00:10.075
I know, but if you do it tonight,
you won't worry.

00:10.280 --> 00:11.554
I'm not worried.

00:14.800 --> 00:16.631
Hey. What are you guys up to tonight?

00:16.800 --> 00:19.189
- Jake's gonna do his homework.
- Why?

00:20.680 --> 00:23.148
It's only Friday.

00:24.640 --> 00:26.437
Let me tell you something
about Charlie.

00:26.600 --> 00:29.558
He was a lousy student. He always
put off doing his homework...

00:29.720 --> 00:33.474
...and his grades reflected it.
- Seems like he's doing okay now.

00:37.120 --> 00:39.793
- Go get your books.
- I left my books at Mom's.

00:39.960 --> 00:43.919
- Fine. I'll have her bring them over.
- Okay. They're in my bag.

00:45.280 --> 00:46.952
Go get them.

00:48.240 --> 00:50.151
Okay. Well, don't wait up.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.719
- Pretty confident, huh?
- Yeah.

00:53.880 --> 00:56.314
Thus, the "don't wait up."

00:56.480 --> 00:58.630
Didn't you meet this girl
a couple of days ago?

00:58.800 --> 01:02.110
Yup. So tonight's the night.
You know, the three-day rule.

01:02.280 --> 01:03.759
That's the three-date rule.

01:05.400 --> 01:06.958
Three dates? That's crazy talk.

01:08.200 --> 01:10.919
All right. If you bring her
back here, please be discreet.

01:11.080 --> 01:13.230
Don't worry.
First night's always at her place.

01:13.400 --> 01:16.870
- Is that another rule?
- No. It's just a common courtesy.

01:18.280 --> 01:21.192
A woman's more relaxed and
comfortable in her own surroundings.

01:22.360 --> 01:25.557
Plus, the minute she falls asleep,
I can hit the bricks.

01:25.720 --> 01:28.280
That's lovely. It's a shame
you don't work for Hallmark.

01:28.440 --> 01:31.591
Yeah, I'll bet those guys
get laid like crazy.

01:32.440 --> 01:34.431
- Goodnight, buddy.
- Night.

01:34.840 --> 01:36.478
What happened
to my chicken nuggets?

01:36.640 --> 01:38.471
What are you talking about?
You ate them.

01:38.640 --> 01:40.756
Now, stop procrastinating
and do your homework.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.513
What does procrastinating mean?

01:43.680 --> 01:46.319
It means putting off stuff
that you have to do.

01:47.960 --> 01:50.633
- Can you use it in a sentence?
- I just did.

01:51.200 --> 01:52.553
Oh, yeah.

01:53.960 --> 01:56.315
Did I tell you a bug
flew in my ear today?

02:00.520 --> 02:02.272
Charlie?

02:03.040 --> 02:06.828
- You asleep?
- What? No.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.594
No. You?

02:09.759 --> 02:12.399
Listen, I have to
get up early tomorrow, so...

02:12.800 --> 02:14.518
- You want me to leave?
- Do you mind?

02:14.680 --> 02:17.114
No, I'm cool either way:
Stay or go.

02:17.280 --> 02:18.918
Okay.

02:19.400 --> 02:20.992
So I'm going?

02:22.760 --> 02:24.034
Thanks, you're a doll.

02:27.720 --> 02:32.748
You know, I actually prefer
waking up in my own bed.

02:33.440 --> 02:35.192
Personal little quirk.

02:35.760 --> 02:38.149
- You don't mind, right?
- Not at all.

02:38.320 --> 02:40.231
Good.

02:40.400 --> 02:44.109
So this worked out well
for all concerned, huh?

02:44.280 --> 02:46.396
It was fantastic.
We'll have to do it again.

02:47.040 --> 02:48.632
Absolutely.

02:49.880 --> 02:53.475
- But not tonight?
- No.

02:54.880 --> 02:58.839
- Okay. Well, I'll call you.
- It's probably easier if I call you.

03:00.560 --> 03:01.834
Sure. Either way.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.036
- I call you, you call me.
- I'll call you.

03:05.800 --> 03:07.677
Good.

03:07.840 --> 03:10.593
- So I guess I'll just let myself out.
- Okay.

03:12.000 --> 03:18.074

03:24.280 --> 03:26.236
Sherri, you asleep?

03:27.640 --> 03:28.834
Finally.

03:58.560 --> 04:00.869
- How was school this week?
- Okay.

04:01.040 --> 04:04.191
- Any homework for the weekend?
- Nope.

04:04.960 --> 04:07.633
- Really?
- Okay, yes.

04:09.360 --> 04:11.396
Do we have to go through this
every Friday?

04:11.560 --> 04:13.630
I'd rather we didn't.

04:18.079 --> 04:19.478
Curly fries.

04:19.640 --> 04:22.029
When I was your age,
we didn't even have curly fries.

04:22.200 --> 04:25.033
We had to make do
with straight or crinkle cut.

04:25.200 --> 04:27.350
- What?
- I'm just trying to distract you...

04:27.520 --> 04:29.795
...while I steal your fries.
- Hey.

04:29.960 --> 04:31.916
Jake, don't be selfish.
Let him have one.

04:32.080 --> 04:33.798
So no date tonight?

04:33.960 --> 04:35.712
I thought
I'd just hang with you guys.

04:35.880 --> 04:39.350
- What about that girl you're seeing?
- Sherri? I'm playing that slow.

04:41.600 --> 04:44.114
Really? Do you mean
at a leisurely pace...

04:44.280 --> 04:46.874
...or as if you were
developmentally challenged?

04:48.280 --> 04:50.748
Oh, aren't you clever? Bite me.

04:52.360 --> 04:54.476
Alan, most beautiful women
are used to guys...

04:54.640 --> 04:56.517
...chasing after them. They expect it.

04:56.680 --> 04:59.592
Squeeze a little more ketchup on it,
would you, buddy?

04:59.760 --> 05:02.149
However, if you hang back
and stay cool...

05:02.320 --> 05:04.390
...the women come to you.

05:04.840 --> 05:08.037
Well, not to you specifically,
but you get the theory.

05:08.200 --> 05:10.475
Yeah, I'm not stupid.
Just physically repellent...

05:10.640 --> 05:12.596
...and inherently unlovable.

05:12.760 --> 05:15.593
Don't get snippy with me.
I'm trying to teach you something.

05:15.760 --> 05:18.274
Hey, I agreed to one.

05:18.440 --> 05:21.352
If you're finished with dinner,
get started on homework.

05:21.520 --> 05:23.636
I'm still hungry. He ate all my fries.

05:23.800 --> 05:26.394
You can have ice cream
when you've done your homework.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.676
Isn't that procrastinating?

05:33.000 --> 05:34.991
Go.

05:38.160 --> 05:41.675
Man, that kid guards his plate
like a one-armed inmate, doesn't he?

05:44.760 --> 05:47.593
Hello? Oh, hey, Sherri.

05:47.760 --> 05:49.318
How's it going?

05:49.480 --> 05:52.438
Tonight? No, I'm sorry, I can't.
I've already got plans.

05:54.320 --> 05:57.995
How about tomorrow night?
Oh, you've got plans.

05:58.160 --> 06:00.276
Okay. Well, Sunday?

06:01.040 --> 06:03.110
Monday?

06:03.280 --> 06:06.352
What about Tuesday?
You know what?

06:06.520 --> 06:10.399
I'm looking at the wrong month
in my date book. Tonight works.

06:12.280 --> 06:14.396
How about I pick you up at 8?

06:14.760 --> 06:17.991
Okay, I'll meet you at 7.

06:18.160 --> 06:19.718
How about Antonio's?

06:19.880 --> 06:21.472
The Oak Room it is.

06:21.640 --> 06:23.710
See you soon.

06:25.840 --> 06:29.310
- What just happened?
- You were playing it slow.

06:33.600 --> 06:35.875
- Everything okay?
- No, perfect, Stephan. Thanks.

06:36.040 --> 06:38.110
Always good to see you.

06:38.880 --> 06:40.916
I liked it too.

06:42.400 --> 06:44.391
So you must be a regular here.

06:44.560 --> 06:46.710
Yeah. Food's good
and I bring a lot of clients.

06:46.880 --> 06:48.996
Speaking of which,
it's getting kind of late.

06:49.160 --> 06:51.754
- I've got an early meeting tomorrow.
- I'll get the check.

06:51.920 --> 06:53.239
I already took care of it.

06:53.400 --> 06:55.436
- When?
- You were in the little boys' room.

06:55.600 --> 06:58.797
- That's not right.
- It's fine. I asked you out. No big deal.

06:58.960 --> 07:01.474
No, you shouldn't call it
"the little boys' room."

07:03.080 --> 07:05.799
- Sorry.
- You're forgiven.

07:05.960 --> 07:06.949
So we can just go.

07:07.480 --> 07:09.550
If it's okay,
I wanna go back to my place.

07:09.720 --> 07:12.109
Oh, great. I'll follow you.

07:12.280 --> 07:14.475
I don't think so, Charlie.
I'm kind of tired.

07:15.280 --> 07:16.838
Okay. Well, how about this?

07:17.000 --> 07:20.310
I'll drive you home, carry you upstairs,
tuck you into bed...

07:20.480 --> 07:23.631
...kiss you good night, and just
as you're drifting off to sleep...

07:23.800 --> 07:27.395
...I will lick your body
from head to toe.

07:28.920 --> 07:32.151
Lovely as that sounds,
I'm gonna have to take a rain check.

07:33.080 --> 07:35.640
Okay. Yeah, I guess
it is getting kind of late.

07:35.800 --> 07:38.712
- It's almost 9.
- Thanks for understanding.

07:38.880 --> 07:42.998
- Sure. Hey, we're okay, right?
- Yeah.

07:43.160 --> 07:45.390
- Did I say something to upset you?
- No.

07:45.560 --> 07:46.879
- Are you mad at me?
- No.

07:47.040 --> 07:48.917
- Promise?
- Yes.

07:49.080 --> 07:52.277
Do I sound like a big old girl?

07:57.920 --> 07:59.512
Why didn't you do this part?

07:59.680 --> 08:01.796
That's extra credit.
You don't have to do it.

08:01.960 --> 08:05.157
- Why don't you do it anyway?
- Because I don't have to.

08:05.320 --> 08:07.754
It shows that you're willing
to make an extra effort.

08:07.920 --> 08:10.275
But I'm not.

08:12.200 --> 08:14.475
- Do it anyway.
- Why?

08:14.640 --> 08:16.551
If you spent as much time
doing the work...

08:16.720 --> 08:18.711
...as you do arguing about it,
we'd be done.

08:18.880 --> 08:21.633
I am done. This is extra.

08:23.920 --> 08:25.478
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:25.640 --> 08:27.710
You're home early.

08:28.920 --> 08:30.911
Alan, if you got something to say...

08:31.080 --> 08:33.150
...why don't you just
come out and say it?

08:36.480 --> 08:38.118
You're home early?

08:38.280 --> 08:40.794
Yeah, that's smart. Keep pushing me.

08:44.600 --> 08:49.230
- Did you see that?
- Yeah, he took my ice cream.

08:58.720 --> 09:00.711
Hey, neighbor.

09:01.760 --> 09:03.159
Hi, Rose.

09:03.320 --> 09:07.108
- Didn't you have dessert with Sherri?
- How did you know I was with Sherri?

09:07.280 --> 09:10.113
Oh, Charlie, you still don't get me,
do you?

09:11.440 --> 09:15.069
- So do you wanna talk about it?
- No.

09:17.480 --> 09:19.914
She probably just had
to get up early, like she said.

09:20.080 --> 09:21.399
Probably.

09:21.560 --> 09:23.755
Unless her real date
didn't start until later...

09:23.920 --> 09:26.115
...and she just didn't wanna eat alone.

09:26.280 --> 09:28.589
What?

09:28.760 --> 09:30.876
Oh, come on, Charlie.
Double-booking.

09:31.040 --> 09:32.359
You practically invented it.

09:33.480 --> 09:36.711
No, she wouldn't do that to me.
Why would she do that to me?

09:36.880 --> 09:40.031
Did she do that to me?
She did that to me, didn't she?

09:42.880 --> 09:44.359
- Excuse me?
- Sorry.

09:44.520 --> 09:47.114
I was just taking
a little selfish delight in your pain.

09:47.280 --> 09:49.077
The Germans call it "schadenfreude"...

09:49.240 --> 09:51.674
...but here in the U.S.A.,
we just go:

09:55.200 --> 09:57.555
- Thanks.
- Oh, Charlie...

09:57.720 --> 10:01.315
...you don't need a girl like that.
You could do so much better.

10:02.240 --> 10:04.037
You're right. I can.

10:04.200 --> 10:05.997
She doesn't call
when she says she will.

10:06.160 --> 10:09.550
She won't let me sleep over.
She's obviously seeing other guys.

10:09.720 --> 10:11.790
So why can't I get her
out of my head?

10:11.960 --> 10:16.670
Okay, that's not where I was going,
but let's review:

10:16.840 --> 10:20.549
She's gorgeous,
but she's also self-centered...

10:20.720 --> 10:23.154
...she's promiscuous,
she's commitment-phobic...

10:23.320 --> 10:25.436
- Oh, my God.
- What?

10:25.600 --> 10:28.637
I'm dating myself.

10:31.200 --> 10:33.919
No wonder the sex is so good.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.116
Trust me. You'll feel better
having this done.

10:41.280 --> 10:44.238
- We'll have the weekend to have fun.
- What if we don't have fun?

10:44.400 --> 10:46.755
Then all this studying
will be for nothing.

10:47.600 --> 10:49.875
That's just a risk we'll have to take.

10:50.040 --> 10:52.679
Now, what year did Magellan
circumnavigate the globe?

10:52.840 --> 10:54.990
- It's not gonna be on the test.
- Maybe not.

10:55.160 --> 10:56.752
It wouldn't hurt
for you to know it.

10:56.920 --> 10:59.150
Why would I wanna know
something I don't have to?

10:59.320 --> 11:01.834
Because maybe you'll need
to know it in the future.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.230
Well, then, that's when I'll learn it.

11:05.320 --> 11:06.878
Why can't you just learn it now?

11:07.040 --> 11:09.156
There's only
so much space in my brain...

11:09.320 --> 11:13.836
...that if you put Magellan in there,
I might forget my locker combination.

11:15.680 --> 11:18.353
- Charlie, help me out here.
- What?

11:18.520 --> 11:21.318
Jake doesn't think he needs
to know anything about Magellan.

11:21.480 --> 11:23.152
What's Magellan?

11:25.360 --> 11:27.635
Okay, I'm out of here.
Won't be late.

11:27.800 --> 11:31.588
Oh, I'm sorry.
Bad news from the clinic?

11:32.720 --> 11:35.553
No. I'm just taking
Sherri out for a nice dinner...

11:35.720 --> 11:37.950
...after which I plan to
gently but firmly...

11:38.120 --> 11:40.190
...extricate myself
from the relationship.

11:40.960 --> 11:42.916
So she got bad news from the clinic?

11:44.200 --> 11:45.997
There's no bad news.
There's no clinic.

11:46.160 --> 11:47.832
- I'm just ending it.
- Why?

11:48.000 --> 11:50.594
Because she's a self-centered,
manipulative narcissist.

11:50.760 --> 11:52.751
So are you.

11:53.520 --> 11:55.272
Hello.

11:58.160 --> 11:59.673
He said "narcissist."

12:00.920 --> 12:03.070
It's not a dirty word.

12:04.400 --> 12:05.879
What does it mean?

12:06.040 --> 12:08.349
If you wanna know,
look it up in the dictionary.

12:08.520 --> 12:10.112
Okay.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.468
He's not coming back.

12:24.280 --> 12:26.999
- Thank you, Steven.
- It's "Stephan."

12:27.160 --> 12:28.673
Sure, it is.

12:33.320 --> 12:35.880
Listen, Sherri, we need to talk.

12:36.040 --> 12:40.591
- You're a terrific woman, but...
- You look so hot tonight.

12:40.960 --> 12:42.234
Really?

12:46.360 --> 12:50.956
- That was incredible.
- Yeah, it was, wasn't it?

12:51.120 --> 12:53.031
It's funny how things work out.

12:53.200 --> 12:55.555
An hour ago I wasn't
feeling too good about us.

12:55.720 --> 12:57.597
I gotta get up
early again tomorrow.

12:57.760 --> 12:59.318
So if you don't mind...

13:05.440 --> 13:08.318
There you go, Elvis.
Peanut butter and bananas.

13:09.960 --> 13:12.520
- My mom cuts it diagonally.
- Yeah?

13:12.680 --> 13:15.717
Well, that's the way
I learned to cut it in prison.

13:17.640 --> 13:18.914
Thank you?

13:22.360 --> 13:25.352
Alan, got a riddle for you:

13:25.520 --> 13:28.478
What's short, picky and only
supposed to be here on weekends?

13:28.640 --> 13:31.074
I'll give you a hint: It's your kid.

13:32.120 --> 13:33.838
I know. I know.
His mother decided...

13:34.000 --> 13:36.798
...she had to go to Palm Springs
to rejuvenate herself.

13:37.440 --> 13:39.112
Detox?

13:39.840 --> 13:41.956
No, a health spa.
Six hundred dollars a day...

13:42.120 --> 13:44.236
...for meditation and colonics.

13:44.920 --> 13:46.512
How in the hell do you meditate...

13:46.680 --> 13:49.990
...when someone's
squirting water up your business?

13:51.480 --> 13:54.040
I don't think they
happen simultaneously, Berta.

13:54.200 --> 13:57.033
That's good, because
it could be very distracting.

13:57.200 --> 14:00.397
I can't even pee
when the cat's watching me.

14:02.720 --> 14:04.756
Nobody answer the phone!

14:04.920 --> 14:07.559
Please, let it be her.
Please, please, please.

14:10.280 --> 14:12.350
No, wait.
Berta, you answer it.

14:12.760 --> 14:14.910
No, no, no! Let it ring.

14:15.280 --> 14:17.589
No, answer it.

14:17.760 --> 14:19.637
- Harper residence.
- I'm not here.

14:19.800 --> 14:22.155
- Yeah, he's here.
- Okay, I'm here.

14:22.600 --> 14:24.431
Jake, it's your mother!

14:25.960 --> 14:30.192
So how's it going down there?
You struck oil yet?

14:32.600 --> 14:34.875
Charlie, what is going on with you?

14:35.360 --> 14:38.033
- What?
- What do you mean, "what"?

14:38.200 --> 14:40.555
You're spending half your time
drinking and moping.

14:40.720 --> 14:42.551
The other half sleeping
and throwing up.

14:42.720 --> 14:44.870
You haven't been
out of the house all week.

14:45.040 --> 14:48.157
You want me
to go out like this in public?

14:48.840 --> 14:52.116
If you feel so strongly about this girl,
why don't you just call her?

14:52.280 --> 14:54.271
Yeah, sure, I could call her.

14:54.440 --> 14:57.671
I could also FedEx her my testicles
in a little silk bag.

14:59.360 --> 15:02.750
All the more reason to call first
and give her a heads-up.

15:02.920 --> 15:05.878
Alan, don't you understand?
This isn't about dating anymore.

15:06.040 --> 15:09.589
It's not even about sex.
It's about self-respect and pride.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.470
Yeah, well, I think
that ship has sailed, Charlie.

15:13.880 --> 15:17.634
See, the problem is
she doesn't need me.

15:18.120 --> 15:20.588
So I need to figure out
a way to show her...

15:20.760 --> 15:23.558
...that I don't need her just as much
as she doesn't need me.

15:23.720 --> 15:25.836
But without seeming needy.

15:27.960 --> 15:30.076
You see my dilemma?

15:30.760 --> 15:33.115
Actually, I think I do.

15:33.280 --> 15:36.556
You feel like I felt
when Judith kicked me out.

15:37.560 --> 15:40.438
All right, if you're gonna mock me,
this conversation's over.

15:44.440 --> 15:48.069
- Who took my sandwich?
- Go do your homework.

15:49.040 --> 15:51.349
Unbelievable.

15:54.640 --> 15:57.837
- I'm glad you were free tonight.
- I'm glad I was home when you called.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.389
I would've called sooner,
but it's been a crazy week.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.312
It's okay. I understand.

16:02.480 --> 16:04.710
- Oh, Charlie, I want you.
- Are you sure?

16:04.880 --> 16:06.916
- Oh, yeah.
- How much?

16:07.080 --> 16:09.435
- Can't you tell?
- I wanna hear it.

16:09.600 --> 16:11.716
I need you. I ache for you.

16:12.320 --> 16:14.356
Okay, then.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.116
- What are you doing?
- I've gotta get home.

16:19.280 --> 16:20.952
I got an early meeting.

16:22.720 --> 16:25.188
- What?
- Beat you to it this time, didn't I?

16:26.400 --> 16:29.551
What are you talk...? What kind
of game are you playing here?

16:29.720 --> 16:33.429
The same game you're playing,
only tonight, I win.

16:34.160 --> 16:35.957
Really? What is it that you're winning?

16:36.120 --> 16:39.590
Charlie, I'm lying here hungry for
your body and you're walking away.

16:39.760 --> 16:42.513
So, what exactly is it
that you're winning?

16:47.560 --> 16:49.312
You know.

16:51.280 --> 16:53.111
- Get out.
- It's too late.

16:53.280 --> 16:55.840
You can't kick me out.
I already said I'm leaving.

17:10.520 --> 17:12.396
Hey.

17:12.560 --> 17:15.551
- So how'd it go?
- Great.

17:15.720 --> 17:18.393
I took control.
I regained my self-respect.

17:18.560 --> 17:20.675
I walked out of there
with my head held high.

17:20.839 --> 17:24.594
Good for you. Good for you.
So you're done beating yourself up?

17:25.520 --> 17:27.192
Not quite.

17:36.040 --> 17:37.837
Jake, wait till we get inside.

17:39.040 --> 17:41.998
I'm hungry.
Uncle Charlie's in there.

17:43.080 --> 17:44.513
I see your point.

17:44.680 --> 17:46.989
At the risk of asking
a foolish question...

17:47.160 --> 17:48.798
...you got any homework
this weekend?

17:48.960 --> 17:52.032
- Nope. Did it at school.
- Really?

17:52.200 --> 17:57.513
- Yup. Did it during detention.
- Jake, why did you have detention?

17:57.680 --> 17:59.875
Because I didn't
do my homework yesterday.

18:00.560 --> 18:03.279
So you did yesterday's homework
and today's homework?

18:03.440 --> 18:05.715
Yup. The extra-credit section
and everything.

18:05.880 --> 18:10.317
- Oh, great. I'll look it over.
- Okay, I didn't do it.

18:11.360 --> 18:14.750
- Jake, why do you keep lying?
- Because I thought you trusted me.

18:17.040 --> 18:19.873
The detention part was true.

18:22.880 --> 18:24.757
Hi, Charlie.

18:24.920 --> 18:27.480
Hey, Rose. What's going on?

18:27.640 --> 18:30.518
I just stopped by to say I'm sorry
things didn't work out...

18:30.680 --> 18:33.513
...with you and Sherri.
- Yeah. Thanks.

18:33.680 --> 18:36.478
And I'm sorry for my
schadenfreude the other day.

18:36.640 --> 18:39.916
I've been riddled with
"glaukenschtuken" ever since.

18:40.080 --> 18:42.719
- Glauken...?
- Schtuken.

18:42.880 --> 18:46.475
It means: " Feeling guilty
for having felt schadenfreude."

18:47.040 --> 18:48.996
- They've got a word for that?
- Not yet.

18:49.160 --> 18:51.993
But I'm hoping
"glaukenschtuken" catches on.

18:53.160 --> 18:55.435
I'll do my part.

18:56.320 --> 18:59.596
You know, something good
did come out of all this:

19:00.200 --> 19:02.111
Watching you obsess over Sherri...

19:02.280 --> 19:05.113
...really helped me understand
my obsession for you.

19:05.280 --> 19:09.068
I mean, you never return my calls.
You always see other women.

19:09.240 --> 19:11.310
You never knowingly
let me sleep over.

19:13.240 --> 19:16.755
And yet, I've never been able
to get you out of my head.

19:17.840 --> 19:19.717
- Interesting.
- Isn't it?

19:19.880 --> 19:24.510
But now that I understand it,
I feel somehow free of it.

19:24.920 --> 19:28.230
Well, that's great, Rose. It sounds
like a real healthy breakthrough.

19:28.400 --> 19:32.996
Yeah. And the best part is now
that the fog of obsession has lifted...

19:33.160 --> 19:37.597
...I can stop idealizing you,
and see you for who you really are.

19:38.720 --> 19:40.870
And who would that be?

19:41.040 --> 19:45.079
An emotionally scarred
and deeply flawed human being.

19:45.800 --> 19:48.598
Who will one day bless me...

19:48.760 --> 19:52.799
...with emotionally scarred
and deeply flawed children.

19:54.760 --> 19:56.079
Rose.

19:57.280 --> 19:59.510
Just hold me.

20:01.800 --> 20:05.156
I like the names Mike and Trudy.
