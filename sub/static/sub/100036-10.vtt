WEBVTT

00:01.585 --> 00:03.154
Previously on This Is Us...

00:03.155 --> 00:05.456
I see it all so clearly.

00:05.457 --> 00:08.173
I see myself walking her down the aisle,

00:08.173 --> 00:11.398
and afterwards coming over
here and raising a toast to her

00:11.399 --> 00:13.767
and her husband at the reception.

00:13.768 --> 00:16.102
You're never gonna be
good enough for her, Jack.

00:16.103 --> 00:18.171
- Say again?
- Jack?

00:18.172 --> 00:19.506
Hey, Bec. I...

00:19.507 --> 00:20.540
Oh!

00:20.541 --> 00:23.943
It was hot out there, and
he just had a few too many.

00:23.944 --> 00:27.180
Hey, why don't we get you home.

00:27.181 --> 00:29.215
I think it's time for
you to get back to L.A.,

00:29.216 --> 00:31.918
live your own life.

00:31.919 --> 00:34.120
I think that's what's next
for me... by the time I'm 40,

00:34.121 --> 00:36.122
I'm gonna have a wife,
I'm gonna have a kid...

00:36.123 --> 00:38.603
- the whole shebang.
- You should probably date somebody first.

00:39.627 --> 00:42.395
You don't seem like yourself today.

00:42.396 --> 00:43.463
You had a few, uh...

00:43.464 --> 00:44.664
mix-ups?

00:46.200 --> 00:48.835
I think I need to see a doctor.

00:48.836 --> 00:51.671
Ooh, I hate CrossFit Toby.

00:51.672 --> 00:54.507
My CrossFit group text is going crazy.

00:54.508 --> 00:56.833
Kate, will you grab my phone?

00:56.834 --> 00:58.834
_

01:04.084 --> 01:06.085
Thanksgiving may be over,

01:06.086 --> 01:08.245
but one more thing
that I'm thankful for is

01:08.246 --> 01:09.823
what a great traveler Jack is.

01:09.824 --> 01:11.157
Unlike...

01:11.158 --> 01:13.092
the screamer in row eight.

01:13.093 --> 01:15.662
Hey, can you, uh, put Jack in his crib?

01:15.663 --> 01:17.697
I am... beat.

01:18.966 --> 01:20.366
Uh...

01:20.367 --> 01:21.668
yeah.

01:22.870 --> 01:24.504
Hey, are, uh...

01:26.540 --> 01:28.141
Are we okay?

01:28.142 --> 01:30.476
I thought we got past Avocado-gate.

01:30.477 --> 01:32.378
We did. I'm just tired.

01:33.022 --> 01:34.780
Well, the daggers shooting

01:34.781 --> 01:36.682
out of your eyes tell
a different story, so...

01:36.683 --> 01:38.447
Why don't you just text Lady Kryptonite

01:38.448 --> 01:40.449
and ask her what her opinion is?

01:41.605 --> 01:43.239
La...

01:45.575 --> 01:47.810
You... you were looking
through my phone?

01:48.617 --> 01:50.828
No. I was...

01:50.829 --> 01:52.687
taking a cute picture of you and Jack,

01:52.688 --> 01:55.223
when I saw you trash-talking
me on your CrossFit text chain.

01:55.224 --> 01:57.692
Oh, man.

01:58.961 --> 02:00.262
Kate...

02:00.263 --> 02:02.864
you and I were just in a...

02:02.865 --> 02:04.966
we were in a weird place,

02:04.967 --> 02:07.135
and I... had to vent,

02:07.136 --> 02:09.104
and I made a mistake and I'm sorry.

02:09.104 --> 02:11.097
Okay, I mean, you guys
are obviously close,

02:11.098 --> 02:13.623
because she has an opinion
about me and our marriage.

02:13.624 --> 02:16.378
Her name is Kara, all right?
And no, we are not close.

02:16.379 --> 02:17.812
I mean, I'm not closer to her

02:17.813 --> 02:19.514
than I am anyone else at the gym.

02:19.515 --> 02:21.612
All right? There's, like,
eight people on this text chain.

02:21.613 --> 02:24.005
Men and women. You can
read the whole thing.

02:24.006 --> 02:28.400
It's mostly just us talking
about glycemic index.

02:28.401 --> 02:30.426
Kate...

02:30.427 --> 02:32.452
we are just friends.

02:32.453 --> 02:34.945
I promise you have
nothing to worry about.

02:34.946 --> 02:38.749
I would not look you in the
eye and lie to you, okay?

02:40.000 --> 02:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:51.647 --> 02:52.981
Okay.

03:01.524 --> 03:04.926
When you tell me
something, I believe you.

03:04.927 --> 03:07.228
'Cause that's how we roll.

03:09.493 --> 03:10.826
Thank you.

03:11.901 --> 03:13.902
Let's just get past this.

03:13.903 --> 03:16.471
- Mm-hmm.
- 'Cause we have a beautiful son,

03:16.472 --> 03:18.673
- and it's almost Christmas.
- That's right.

03:23.846 --> 03:25.880
Oh, God.

03:25.881 --> 03:28.383
Kev hired a matchmaker.

03:28.384 --> 03:31.019
Yeah, so, it's the altitude, you know?

03:31.020 --> 03:34.144
The oxygen in Ethiopia
does something to the beans.

03:34.145 --> 03:36.183
Wow, that's so cool.

03:36.184 --> 03:38.709
Yeah. I know. So, what
do you do for a living?

03:38.710 --> 03:42.103
I just got my PhD in molecular biology.

03:42.104 --> 03:44.399
Huh.

03:44.400 --> 03:46.935
You're way too smart for
me and my little bean fact,

03:46.936 --> 03:49.637
- aren't you?
- Yeah, I-I think so.

03:49.638 --> 03:51.005
Well...

03:51.006 --> 03:52.440
Merry Christmas.

03:58.347 --> 03:59.781
Man.

03:59.782 --> 04:01.950
All the best neurologists are booked

04:01.951 --> 04:03.118
through the holidays.

04:07.156 --> 04:08.556
Okay, I'm off.

04:08.557 --> 04:10.859
I made you a protein shake for the road.

04:10.860 --> 04:12.794
Oh. Thanks.

04:12.795 --> 04:14.358
Found it on the CrossFit blog.

04:14.359 --> 04:16.029
You're the sweetest. Thanks.

04:16.031 --> 04:20.067
Uh, I should go. I.T.
solutions wait for no man.

04:23.806 --> 04:25.306
Mmm.

04:25.307 --> 04:27.842
There's nothing like
coffee from Ethiopia.

04:27.843 --> 04:30.512
Yes. See? This is what
I keep telling everyone.

04:30.513 --> 04:33.848
At least Ethiopians are good
for something, right?

04:34.399 --> 04:36.023
Hmm.

04:36.024 --> 04:37.315
Yeah.

04:37.316 --> 04:39.508
I really got to get a new matchmaker.

04:39.509 --> 04:41.501
Happy New Year.

04:46.429 --> 04:47.862
Okay, and trust me,

04:47.863 --> 04:49.931
she's the best neurologist in L.A.

04:49.932 --> 04:52.518
All right. Well, I'll call her
first thing after New Year's.

04:52.519 --> 04:53.968
I'm way ahead of you.

04:53.969 --> 04:57.005
I've been wearing the doctor
down and made us an appointment.

04:57.006 --> 04:58.673
Us?

04:58.674 --> 05:00.699
You coming out for this?

05:00.700 --> 05:03.193
This family flies across
country at the drop of a hat,

05:03.194 --> 05:06.512
and this is actually important,
Miguel, so of course I'm coming.

05:06.513 --> 05:08.883
- Got it. Okay.
- Will you do me a favor, please?

05:08.884 --> 05:11.853
- Four. Three. Two. One.
- Don't tell Kate or Kevin.

05:11.854 --> 05:13.855
Happy New Year!

05:13.856 --> 05:16.724
Shut up and lay one on me.

05:38.047 --> 05:39.723
I'm sorry.

05:39.724 --> 05:42.966
I got a little carried away
with the fr-free gin and tonics

05:42.967 --> 05:45.101
- at the golf course.
- Mm.

05:45.102 --> 05:49.973
Probably should have had more
than just toast for breakfast.

05:52.209 --> 05:54.644
My dad seemed kind of upset.

05:54.645 --> 05:57.180
Did something happen
between the two of you?

05:57.965 --> 05:59.065
No.

06:00.985 --> 06:03.420
- No.
- I know he can come across a little...

06:03.421 --> 06:05.655
old-fashioned, but...

06:05.656 --> 06:07.781
once you get to know him,
he really is the best.

06:07.782 --> 06:10.427
Yeah, no, he... yeah,
he's great. Mm-hmm.

06:10.428 --> 06:12.095
Maybe just...

06:12.096 --> 06:16.032
take it easy on the G
and Ts on Saturday night?

06:18.488 --> 06:20.189
Saturday night?

06:20.190 --> 06:23.125
That's... it's my dad's big
birthday party, remember?

06:23.126 --> 06:24.827
Yeah.

06:24.828 --> 06:26.862
I wouldn't miss it.

06:36.473 --> 06:40.767
Are you sure you don't
want to come stay at my place?

06:40.768 --> 06:42.244
I know you don't love it here.

06:42.245 --> 06:44.814
No, this place, this
place is like the Ritz.

06:44.815 --> 06:47.974
Oh, yeah, my butler, he's on vacation,

06:47.975 --> 06:49.618
but, you know, when
he gets back, it's...

06:51.621 --> 06:53.389
It's fine.

06:53.390 --> 06:54.957
Just temporary.

06:54.958 --> 06:56.359
Okay.

07:05.740 --> 07:08.041
You're two weeks late on rent, Pearson.

07:09.482 --> 07:11.640
You know, they-they didn't
have a whole lot of shifts

07:11.641 --> 07:13.267
at the gas station this week.

07:13.268 --> 07:15.444
I take cash or check. No excuses.

07:17.147 --> 07:19.582
You have till the end of the week.

07:19.583 --> 07:22.685
Got it.

07:42.472 --> 07:43.939
Hey.

07:43.940 --> 07:46.442
- Hmm?
- It's gonna be okay.

07:46.443 --> 07:49.278
And remember, we've got an episode

07:49.279 --> 07:52.515
of World of Dance waiting for us
on that DVR when we get home.

07:52.516 --> 07:54.750
- It's the duels night.
- Oh.

07:54.751 --> 07:55.985
Your favorite round.

07:55.986 --> 07:58.220
- Hmm.
- So...

08:00.307 --> 08:02.725
So, Randall, the councilman office

08:02.726 --> 08:04.517
has you busy with work these days?

08:04.518 --> 08:06.104
Every time I knock out one thing,

08:06.105 --> 08:08.097
six more pop up in its place.

08:08.098 --> 08:10.833
Well, you really didn't need to fly

08:10.834 --> 08:13.536
all the way across the country
for a preliminary memory test.

08:13.537 --> 08:16.605
Which your mom is gonna ace, by the way.

08:18.074 --> 08:19.975
I'm sure she will.

08:19.976 --> 08:22.978
But I pulled a lot of strings
to get this appointment,

08:22.979 --> 08:25.648
and I am happy to be here.

08:25.649 --> 08:28.484
I'm sorry to keep asking
you to keep this to yourself,

08:28.485 --> 08:30.553
but you know, Kate has a
lot on her plate with Jack,

08:30.554 --> 08:33.556
and Kevin is focused on his sobriety...

08:33.557 --> 08:35.057
I get it.

08:36.525 --> 08:37.827
Rebecca Pearson?

08:37.828 --> 08:40.383
Yeah. I'm her son, Randall Pearson.

08:40.384 --> 08:42.909
Nice to finally meet the
man behind the 47 emails.

08:42.909 --> 08:45.008
- Thank you so much for squeezing us in like this.
- Mm-hmm.

08:45.009 --> 08:46.535
Hi, I'm Rebecca.

08:46.536 --> 08:48.270
And this is my husband Miguel.

08:48.271 --> 08:49.657
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

08:49.658 --> 08:51.207
I'm Dr. Whitaker.

08:51.208 --> 08:53.442
I'll be administering the test,
which will assess your memory

08:53.443 --> 08:56.111
- and language skills.
- Any chance we can get the answers today?

08:56.112 --> 08:58.113
I'm in from out of town, so...

08:58.114 --> 08:59.615
If you don't mind hanging out for a bit,

08:59.616 --> 09:01.308
I can go over the
results this afternoon.

09:01.309 --> 09:03.152
It's mac and cheese
day at the cafeteria.

09:03.153 --> 09:04.520
- Great.
- Oh.

09:04.521 --> 09:07.323
- Right this way, Rebecca.
- Okay.

09:08.118 --> 09:11.487
Um... I'm gonna be fine, guys.

09:18.602 --> 09:21.470
- What do you think?
- Gross.

09:21.471 --> 09:23.739
I wouldn't even wear
that thing if I was dead.

09:23.740 --> 09:27.186
Kev, I'm throwing Toby a Jimmy
Buffet-themed surprise party.

09:27.187 --> 09:28.768
- He has to have a Hawaiian shirt.
- Sure.

09:28.769 --> 09:31.013
Oh, and I bought Jack this
cute little Hawaiian outfit.

09:31.014 --> 09:33.440
Look at you going all out
for Toby's birthday, huh?

09:33.441 --> 09:34.832
I don't know. I just think
that if I show him that

09:34.833 --> 09:36.290
I'm accepting his CrossFit buddies

09:36.291 --> 09:37.949
in all of their tire-flipping glory

09:37.950 --> 09:39.551
by inviting them over...

09:39.552 --> 09:41.357
Even trash-talking Lady Dynamite?

09:41.358 --> 09:42.791
It's Kryptonite.

09:42.792 --> 09:44.410
Oh. I hate her even more.

09:44.411 --> 09:47.897
I found these really cute

09:47.898 --> 09:49.999
pineapple string lights.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.104
Ha! They are super on theme,

09:52.105 --> 09:54.014
and you can use them
to strangle that monster

09:54.015 --> 09:55.176
who's been talking smack about you

09:55.177 --> 09:56.772
- behind your back.
- Madison,

09:56.773 --> 09:58.974
I am not murdering Lady Kryptonite.

09:58.975 --> 10:00.576
I didn't say murder.

10:00.577 --> 10:02.316
Just choke her a little.
Give her a good scare.

10:02.317 --> 10:03.612
Yeah, that's good.

10:03.613 --> 10:05.307
This is why you're not invited

10:05.308 --> 10:06.733
- to the party. Yeah.
- Yeah.

10:06.734 --> 10:08.725
I'm gonna go get a coffee,
'cause I have my reshoots

10:08.726 --> 10:10.318
with the M. Night
Shyamalan movie tonight,

10:10.319 --> 10:12.021
which means the caffeine
drip starts right now.

10:12.022 --> 10:13.389
Do you want to... Do you want to join?

10:13.390 --> 10:16.325
- Yeah, coffee sounds good.
- Cool.

10:16.326 --> 10:18.761
Listen, I'm-I'm quitting this
whole matchmaking service.

10:18.762 --> 10:21.096
You know, I just... I'm
sick of trying so hard.

10:21.097 --> 10:24.233
Universe, it's up to you, man.

10:31.241 --> 10:32.641
- Kev.
- Uh-huh.

10:32.642 --> 10:34.743
The universe does not work that fast.

10:34.744 --> 10:36.812
Well...

10:36.813 --> 10:38.147
Oh, Lord.

10:38.148 --> 10:39.481
I don't know.

10:39.482 --> 10:41.250
You know what, I'm gon... I'm gonna...

10:41.251 --> 10:42.952
- go talk to her.
- Yeah, okay.

10:42.953 --> 10:45.387
And I'm gonna go turn my
living room into Margaritaville.

10:45.388 --> 10:46.655
- Have...
- Good-good luck.

10:46.656 --> 10:47.990
Love you.

10:51.494 --> 10:53.289
Oh, you should try cinnamon in that.

10:53.290 --> 10:54.378
What? Oh.

10:54.379 --> 10:57.032
Oh, shoot. I'm sorry. That's
my bad. Let me help you with that.

10:57.033 --> 10:58.667
- That's okay.
- Oh, is that your dog?

10:58.668 --> 10:59.902
Uh, yeah.

10:59.903 --> 11:01.236
That's Adrian.

11:01.237 --> 11:03.372
Like Adrian Balboa from

11:03.373 --> 11:04.940
- Rocky.
- Rocky. Yeah, of course.

11:04.941 --> 11:06.108
- Yeah, I know it.
- Yeah.

11:06.109 --> 11:08.210
That's great.

11:08.211 --> 11:10.412
Uh, Kevin.

11:10.413 --> 11:11.413
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:11.414 --> 11:12.915
Nice to meet you, Devin.

11:12.916 --> 11:15.250
Oh, no, I'm sorry,
it's, um... it's Kevin.

11:15.251 --> 11:17.653
I know who you are. I'm
just messing with you.

11:17.654 --> 11:18.721
Oh.

11:18.722 --> 11:20.489
You're cute when you're flustered.

11:20.490 --> 11:22.825
- Well, thank you.
- Sure.

11:22.826 --> 11:24.727
I'm Lizzy.

11:24.728 --> 11:27.162
Good to meet you.

11:42.082 --> 11:44.150
Ugh, my mom is

11:44.151 --> 11:47.420
driving me crazy about my dad's
birthday party this weekend.

11:47.421 --> 11:50.423
She says everything has to be perfect

11:50.424 --> 11:52.892
or the neighbors will talk.

11:55.478 --> 11:57.579
Jack, what's wrong?

12:02.169 --> 12:04.337
Rebecca, I think we should take a break.

12:06.440 --> 12:09.075
What? What do you mean?

12:09.076 --> 12:12.979
We're just... too different.

12:12.980 --> 12:15.915
I mean, you-you dine at country clubs,

12:15.916 --> 12:19.986
and I-I can't even afford
the pepperoni on this pizza.

12:21.855 --> 12:23.689
But I don't care about that.

12:23.690 --> 12:25.691
- I never have.
- Yeah, but I do.

12:28.551 --> 12:31.310
I'm a part-time mechanic

12:31.311 --> 12:33.603
at an auto shop scraping
to make ends meet.

12:33.604 --> 12:36.042
That's who I am,

12:36.043 --> 12:37.310
a part-time mechanic.

12:37.311 --> 12:38.711
You...

12:38.712 --> 12:40.480
That's not who you belong with.

12:41.515 --> 12:43.182
Where is this coming from?

12:43.183 --> 12:44.350
Jack.

12:44.351 --> 12:45.752
I'm sorry.

12:51.091 --> 12:52.859
I can't even afford the tip.

12:52.860 --> 12:56.896
So, if you could, uh...

12:56.897 --> 12:58.598
I'm sorry.

13:11.111 --> 13:14.047
Okay, so this is your first task.

13:14.048 --> 13:17.513

13:17.514 --> 13:20.153

hands at ten past 11:00.

13:35.135 --> 13:37.861
I'm gonna read you some phrases,

13:37.862 --> 13:40.473

13:40.474 --> 13:44.210

13:44.211 --> 13:48.514
I only know that Michael

Randall.

13:58.692 --> 13:59.959
Mm.

14:02.463 --> 14:05.465
Just for the record,

14:05.466 --> 14:10.303
I am perfectly capable of
taking my wife to the doctor.

14:10.304 --> 14:11.771
Rebecca and I,

14:11.772 --> 14:13.506
we're getting older.

14:13.507 --> 14:15.141
So we forget things sometimes.

14:15.142 --> 14:17.210
Hey, Miguel, I would
love it if I came out here

14:17.211 --> 14:19.145
for absolutely nothing.

14:19.146 --> 14:21.314
But I know my mother.

14:21.315 --> 14:23.383
I spent one day with
her at Thanksgiving,

14:23.384 --> 14:25.017
and I could tell that something was off.

14:26.887 --> 14:29.021
How could you not see it?

14:30.057 --> 14:32.291
Like I said, Randall,

14:32.292 --> 14:34.861
Rebecca and I are getting older.

14:34.862 --> 14:36.835
It is normal.

14:36.836 --> 14:39.065
I went grocery shopping yesterday,

14:39.066 --> 14:41.000
and I forgot to pick up milk.

14:41.001 --> 14:43.236
Do you want to go up there and
make an appointment for me next?

14:43.237 --> 14:44.897
- Okay.
- And to top it all off,

14:44.898 --> 14:47.540
you had to fly out here
like some kind of hero.

14:47.541 --> 14:48.775
Due respect, Miguel,

14:48.776 --> 14:50.343
I'm not being a hero...
I'm being supportive.

14:50.344 --> 14:52.378
Due respect, Randall,
you're just being Randall.

14:52.379 --> 14:55.648
Yeah. Okay.

14:58.443 --> 14:59.968
Okay. My turn.

14:59.969 --> 15:02.188
- Okay.
- Uh, movie theater popcorn

15:02.189 --> 15:04.266
with peanut butter M&M'S
sprinkled all over it.

15:04.267 --> 15:06.750
That is not a guilty pleasure.
That's just a delicious snack.

15:06.751 --> 15:08.498
Well, no, no, I agree, but
you didn't let me finish.

15:08.499 --> 15:10.663
- Okay.
- Okay, sometimes I don't even stay for the movie.

15:10.664 --> 15:12.932
- No.
- I will snatch that up, go home

15:12.933 --> 15:15.802
and just binge old episodes
of Ice Loves Coco.

15:15.803 --> 15:17.971
Should I know what that is?

15:17.972 --> 15:20.102
No, it's... Actually, it's
probably better that you don't.

15:20.103 --> 15:21.874
- Okay.
- Okay, favorite musician. Go.

15:21.875 --> 15:23.042
Easy. John Legend all the way.

15:23.043 --> 15:24.377
Ooh, that's a good one.

15:24.378 --> 15:25.711
When I was a little
kid, I actually played

15:25.712 --> 15:27.380
- a little classical piano.
- Huh.

15:27.381 --> 15:29.515
Not anywhere near as good as him, but...

15:29.516 --> 15:30.850
That's cool.

15:30.851 --> 15:32.752
Um...

15:32.753 --> 15:34.520
- Hmm.
- Do you need to get that?

15:34.521 --> 15:36.088
- No. It's okay.
- It's okay.

15:36.089 --> 15:38.090
- No, no, it's-it's just my mom.
- Okay.

15:38.091 --> 15:41.093
She would flip if she knew
that I was here with you.

15:41.094 --> 15:42.628
She is a big Manny fan.

15:42.629 --> 15:43.629
- Ah.
- Mm-hmm.

15:43.630 --> 15:44.931
You can get it, though. It's okay.

15:44.932 --> 15:46.132
I mean, I'll-I'll do the whole thing.

15:46.133 --> 15:48.968
- What?
- You know, you put her on speaker

15:48.969 --> 15:51.637
and I say hi to her and
I say, "Manny say what?"

15:51.638 --> 15:53.141
I've done it, like, a
million times at this point.

15:53.142 --> 15:54.807
I mean, that's very
nice of you to offer,

15:54.808 --> 15:56.809
but you don't have to do that.

15:56.810 --> 16:00.847
I'd kind of rather just keep you
all to myself, if that's okay.

16:01.882 --> 16:03.382
That's...

16:03.383 --> 16:04.917
even better, actually.

16:04.918 --> 16:07.220
That's great.

16:08.455 --> 16:10.089
Besides, I can tell her all about it

16:10.090 --> 16:11.757
when I fly home tomorrow.

16:11.758 --> 16:14.393
You fly home tomorrow?

16:14.394 --> 16:15.795
You don't... you don't live here?

16:15.796 --> 16:17.563
- Mm-mm.
- Ah!

16:17.564 --> 16:20.566
I'm just here for a conference,
and I had my last day free.

16:20.567 --> 16:22.058
I'm still a Chicago girl.

16:22.059 --> 16:24.937
Oh, man, that's... Chicago.

16:24.938 --> 16:27.206
- I know.
- Well, I'll tell you what.

16:27.207 --> 16:29.208
I got to work tonight. I
got these reshoots to do.

16:29.209 --> 16:30.710
But until then, I'm pretty free.

16:30.711 --> 16:33.646
So, um, tell me your
L.A. hopes and dreams.

16:33.647 --> 16:35.262
I will take you where you want to go.

16:35.263 --> 16:36.854
- What do you want to do?
- Uh...

16:36.855 --> 16:38.918
I was gonna go to Hollywood Boulevard

16:38.919 --> 16:41.053
and put my hands in
Paul Newman's handprints.

16:41.054 --> 16:42.855
Yeah, no, listen, I
got a better idea, okay?

16:42.856 --> 16:45.424
- Okay.
- I'm gonna make a couple of phone calls.

16:45.425 --> 16:47.927
Just... trust me.

16:54.167 --> 16:55.601
Hi.

16:55.602 --> 16:56.769
Hey! I'm Kurt.

16:56.770 --> 16:58.271
It's so good to finally meet

16:58.272 --> 17:00.006
- all you guys.
- Well, we're glad to be here.

17:00.007 --> 17:01.140
Your husband's the best.

17:01.141 --> 17:03.142
He really is.

17:03.143 --> 17:04.710
Um, is Kara here?

17:04.711 --> 17:06.913
I've heard so much about her.

17:06.914 --> 17:09.582
Mm, nope. I don't see her.

17:09.583 --> 17:10.840
Oh!

17:10.842 --> 17:12.484
Hey, uh, guys, he's, like, seconds away.

17:12.486 --> 17:13.752
Time for the surprise.

17:13.753 --> 17:16.188
I'm going to immortalize
the look on his face

17:16.189 --> 17:17.857
and then torture him with it.

17:17.858 --> 17:20.059
You don't think he
suspects anything, do you?

17:20.060 --> 17:22.385
Heck if I know. He hasn't
been to the gym in two weeks.

17:22.386 --> 17:24.463
What do you mean? He goes every day.

17:24.464 --> 17:26.799
Oh, he switched to a different
gym a couple weeks ago.

17:27.646 --> 17:29.571
Oh, look.

17:29.572 --> 17:31.671
- Surprise!
- Hey!

17:37.711 --> 17:41.026
♪ The smell of the sea
breeze and the ocean... ♪

17:41.697 --> 17:44.822
- Here we go.
- Okay, this isn't the part of the adventure

17:44.823 --> 17:47.443
where I find out Kevin Pearson
is a serial killer, is it?

17:47.444 --> 17:49.111
What? No, of course not.

17:49.112 --> 17:51.063
- Okay.
- When that happens, you'll know.

17:51.064 --> 17:52.355
- Hmm?
- I'm just kidding.

17:52.356 --> 17:55.091
Here we go.

17:57.227 --> 17:58.795
Where are we?

17:58.796 --> 18:01.130
This is the Hollywood Bowl.

18:01.131 --> 18:03.432
- How did you do this?
- Uh,

18:03.433 --> 18:05.768
the-the manager is a fan, so...

18:05.769 --> 18:07.236
Yeah, I do have to make an appearance

18:07.237 --> 18:08.504
at his daughter's bat mitzvah,

18:08.505 --> 18:09.614
but, uh...

18:09.615 --> 18:11.429
Well, that's very generous of you.

18:11.430 --> 18:12.928
Hang on.

18:12.929 --> 18:15.111
Sorry, my... mom is just dying

18:15.112 --> 18:16.679
- for a play-by-play.
- It's okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:16.680 --> 18:17.847
No, it's okay.

18:23.660 --> 18:25.735
So...

18:25.736 --> 18:27.093
what'd you tell your mom about me?

18:27.094 --> 18:28.958
Um...

18:28.959 --> 18:31.961
that I'm beginning to
feel like Cinderella,

18:31.962 --> 18:33.529
without the fancy shoes.

18:33.530 --> 18:36.199
Kevin Pearson, hopeless romantic.

18:36.200 --> 18:37.834
Yeah, well, I get it from my parents.

18:37.835 --> 18:40.069
I don't know. They had this sort of, uh,

18:40.070 --> 18:42.438
effortlessly magical love story.

18:42.439 --> 18:43.840
- Mm.
- You know? My dad actually used

18:43.841 --> 18:45.541
to talk about it in terms of fate.

18:45.542 --> 18:47.476
Yeah, he said he knew my mom was the one

18:47.477 --> 18:49.378
the moment that he saw her.

18:49.379 --> 18:51.848
He said he locked eyes with her,

18:51.849 --> 18:55.017
felt it in his bones.

18:58.488 --> 19:00.323
Wow.

19:00.324 --> 19:03.626
Well, to your disgustingly
romantic parents.

19:04.628 --> 19:06.429
For making you who you are.

19:06.430 --> 19:08.598
Oh, I'm nowhere as
near as good as my dad.

19:08.599 --> 19:11.434
Um, I did, however, do that.

19:11.435 --> 19:13.269
Hey, Kev!

19:13.270 --> 19:14.904
- What's up, man?
- What's up?

19:14.905 --> 19:16.960
I hear you got a special
lady in the audience.

19:16.961 --> 19:19.475
Uh, I do. Yeah, this is Lizzy.

19:19.476 --> 19:21.210
Hi, Lizzy.

19:21.211 --> 19:23.045
This one's dedicated to you.

19:23.046 --> 19:25.548
Hell, nobody else is here,

19:25.549 --> 19:28.351
so all of them are dedicated to you.

19:28.352 --> 19:30.353
Have a seat.

19:34.892 --> 19:36.726
Sweetheart,

19:36.727 --> 19:38.728
you're five hours early.

19:38.729 --> 19:39.962
Where's Jack?

19:43.967 --> 19:46.569
Oh.

20:03.186 --> 20:04.387
So,

20:04.388 --> 20:06.155
how'd the test go?

20:06.156 --> 20:08.157
Well, I think.

20:08.158 --> 20:09.892
Yeah.

20:09.893 --> 20:14.236
She asked me what day it
was and what city I lived in.

20:14.237 --> 20:15.698
And I told her

20:15.699 --> 20:18.634
that only L.A. would be this
warm on January the 11th.

20:18.635 --> 20:21.003
- Well, sounds like you did great, honey.
- Yeah.

20:23.840 --> 20:25.641
Look at that little guy.

20:25.642 --> 20:28.044
Look at him.

20:32.182 --> 20:35.551
I have been thinking a lot
about when you were that age.

20:35.552 --> 20:36.852
Really?

20:36.853 --> 20:39.855
Mm-hmm. Yep.

20:42.025 --> 20:45.428
Kevin and Kate might have been
the only babies in the world

20:45.429 --> 20:47.196
that liked to sleep in.

20:47.197 --> 20:48.397
But you,

20:48.398 --> 20:51.467
you were always an early riser.

20:51.468 --> 20:54.770
And I used to tiptoe into your nursery

20:54.771 --> 20:57.173
as soon as I heard you crying.

21:07.050 --> 21:11.487
And I would listen to Joni Mitchell

21:11.488 --> 21:14.390
on my little Walkman that
was a gift from your father.

21:14.391 --> 21:17.793
And I would sit in my
rocking chair by the window,

21:17.794 --> 21:22.098
and I would rock you on my lap.

21:22.099 --> 21:25.601
You'd stay pretty quiet as
long as I kept rocking you.

21:25.602 --> 21:30.439
And then we would watch
the sunrise together.

21:32.342 --> 21:35.478
Except we couldn't actually
watch the sun come up

21:35.479 --> 21:37.546
because your siblings were asleep,

21:37.547 --> 21:41.017
and I didn't want it to
get too bright in there.

21:41.018 --> 21:45.388
But we would watch the light
change through the curtain.

21:49.960 --> 21:53.763
And I would hold your warm
little body against mine.

21:53.764 --> 21:56.599
And I'd listen to my music

21:56.600 --> 21:59.402
and your breathing.

21:59.403 --> 22:01.470
And I would just wish that

22:01.471 --> 22:04.940
I could make time stand still.

22:06.877 --> 22:10.613
Babies change so fast at that age.

22:10.614 --> 22:13.883
I knew that any morning
might be the last time

22:13.884 --> 22:15.551
you ever let me rock you like that.

22:15.552 --> 22:19.588
So I made sure to remember

22:19.589 --> 22:22.558
every little detail

22:22.559 --> 22:24.794
of those mornings.

22:37.407 --> 22:40.042
Hello?

22:40.043 --> 22:41.043
Okay.

22:42.474 --> 22:44.732
All right, well, I-I'll be right up.

22:44.733 --> 22:46.734
Thank you.

22:47.884 --> 22:49.885
Um, that was Dr. Whitaker,

22:49.886 --> 22:51.320
and she has my results.

22:51.321 --> 22:54.723
But she wants the two of
you in the room with me

22:54.724 --> 22:57.393
when I hear them.

I had a few heartbreaks,
too, before I met your father.

24:24.530 --> 24:27.031
Thanks, Mom.

24:27.032 --> 24:29.567
You like him very much, don't you?

24:29.568 --> 24:33.171
- Jack?
- No.

24:33.172 --> 24:34.405
I love him.

24:36.241 --> 24:37.875
Oh, come on.

24:37.876 --> 24:39.544
You haven't been together long enough

24:39.545 --> 24:41.946
- for all of that.
- I love him.

24:41.947 --> 24:44.482
It doesn't matter how
long we've been together.

24:44.483 --> 24:47.752
You wouldn't understand.

24:50.422 --> 24:53.157
Because your father
and I aren't in love?

24:53.158 --> 24:55.159
No, that's not what I meant.

24:55.160 --> 24:58.196
- Yes, it is.
- It's just Jack...

24:58.197 --> 25:00.031
And you're wrong.

25:00.032 --> 25:03.234
I love your father very much.

25:03.235 --> 25:07.371
I know it's not a flashy kind of love.

25:07.372 --> 25:10.495
No spontaneous cross-country road trips,

25:10.496 --> 25:11.542
that's for sure.

25:11.543 --> 25:14.212
But that isn't all that love is.

25:14.213 --> 25:16.781
Not a love that endures, anyway.

25:16.782 --> 25:20.718
When you're with someone day
after day, night after night,

25:20.719 --> 25:23.154
it becomes about...

25:23.155 --> 25:26.357
you know, the small, ordinary moments.

25:26.358 --> 25:28.860
Like when you're reading
the paper together,

25:28.861 --> 25:31.629
and he hands me an article
he knows I'm gonna like

25:31.630 --> 25:33.231
without saying a word.

25:33.232 --> 25:37.235
Or he makes me a Tom Collins to drink

25:37.236 --> 25:40.071
while we're watching Mary Tyler Moore.

25:43.008 --> 25:46.110
Your father is dependable.

25:46.111 --> 25:48.670
He provided a life for us.

25:48.671 --> 25:50.903
And I know that you think
that that's old-fashioned,

25:50.904 --> 25:52.550
but it means something.

25:52.551 --> 25:56.787
Someone you can rely on.

25:56.788 --> 25:58.789
So you can imagine how scary it was

25:58.790 --> 26:01.325
for us to see you
with someone like Jack.

26:01.326 --> 26:03.261
No job, no prospects...

26:03.262 --> 26:05.696
- Mom...
- Let me finish. Let me finish.

26:08.261 --> 26:11.196
It was scary for us.

26:13.705 --> 26:17.542
But this is your life,

26:17.543 --> 26:21.629
and you have to do...

26:21.630 --> 26:23.064
what you want.

26:25.817 --> 26:28.176
Which is why I think I
should tell you that...

26:30.055 --> 26:33.024
I think your father...

26:33.025 --> 26:35.026
got into Jack's head.

26:37.262 --> 26:38.829
What do you mean?

26:38.830 --> 26:41.499
Well, evidently, when
they were playing golf,

26:41.500 --> 26:46.404
your father made it very clear to Jack

26:46.405 --> 26:49.607
that he's not good enough for you.

26:52.544 --> 26:56.881
And your father can be very convincing.

27:06.458 --> 27:09.660
I have to go.

27:09.661 --> 27:12.296
- What should I tell your father?
- Whatever you want to tell him.

27:12.297 --> 27:15.399
Rebecca, if-if he is really your choice,

27:15.400 --> 27:18.669
this dark, complicated man...

27:21.206 --> 27:24.575
... make sure he gives
you a great love story.

27:25.977 --> 27:27.778
One for the ages.

27:38.156 --> 27:41.592
Rebecca, I know this
might be difficult to hear,

27:41.593 --> 27:44.929
but it appears you have
what we doctors call

27:44.930 --> 27:46.664
"mild cognitive impairment".

27:46.665 --> 27:51.302
- Mild cognitive impairment?
- What does that mean?

27:51.303 --> 27:54.238
It means that the test
revealed some changes

27:54.239 --> 27:56.173
in your understanding of things.

27:56.174 --> 27:58.676
And that concerns me. For example,

27:58.677 --> 28:01.679
there are some inconsistencies

28:01.680 --> 28:03.781
between the spacing and the numbers

28:03.782 --> 28:05.116
and the shape of the clock.

28:06.807 --> 28:10.668
Okay. I mean, I'm no Michelangelo,

28:10.669 --> 28:12.923
but the numbers are correct

28:12.924 --> 28:16.627
and in order, and that
is very clearly a clock.

28:16.628 --> 28:19.715
Yes, it's clearly a clock.

28:19.716 --> 28:22.136
But it shows the beginnings
of spatial dysfunction.

28:23.535 --> 28:25.369
So I struggled with one question.

28:25.370 --> 28:27.338
That hardly feels like
a failing grade to me.

28:27.339 --> 28:30.374
You also had trouble
remembering several phrases

28:30.375 --> 28:33.308
shortly after hearing them.

28:33.309 --> 28:35.434
Um, so what are you saying?

28:35.435 --> 28:37.894
Could-could you please
just tell us what she has?

28:39.651 --> 28:41.652
Before we put a name to it,

28:41.653 --> 28:44.321
I'd like to do more
blood tests and an MRI

28:44.322 --> 28:45.656
to rule some things out.

28:45.657 --> 28:48.192
But right now, there's nothing to do

28:48.193 --> 28:50.161
but wait and see how
Rebecca does over time.

28:50.162 --> 28:53.230
What, exactly, are we looking out for?

28:53.231 --> 28:56.133
On one end of the spectrum,
we could just be looking at

28:56.134 --> 28:59.136
continued minor
incidents of memory loss.

28:59.137 --> 29:03.240
Or things could begin to deteriorate.

29:03.241 --> 29:06.277
There is a chance that
over time you'll experience

29:06.278 --> 29:08.012
more difficulty with memory.

29:08.013 --> 29:11.282
But for now, we need to
run some additional tests

29:11.283 --> 29:14.051
to understand what it is
we're seeing here today.

29:14.052 --> 29:17.121
I'm so sorry to sound
like a broken record...

29:19.216 --> 29:20.783
Good night.

29:22.672 --> 29:24.997
Okay.

29:24.998 --> 29:27.446
Everyone's gone. Let's just do this.

29:27.447 --> 29:29.782
Okay, Tobe.

29:31.657 --> 29:34.059
Do you want to tell me why
you've been going to a new gym

29:34.060 --> 29:35.594
for weeks without telling me?

29:37.330 --> 29:39.498
You were right about Kara.

29:39.499 --> 29:41.767
Lady Kryptonite.

29:41.768 --> 29:44.436
When we got back from
our Thanksgiving trip,

29:44.437 --> 29:45.437
she tried to kiss me.

29:45.438 --> 29:47.139
What?

29:47.140 --> 29:51.048
And I stopped it. Okay?
It never even happened.

29:51.049 --> 29:53.598
I dodged her head like
Neo in The Matrix.

29:53.599 --> 29:55.533
But I also realized that
I probably shouldn't be

29:55.534 --> 29:58.269
spending any more time around
her, so I switched gyms.

29:58.270 --> 30:00.438
Okay, well, then why
didn't you just tell me?

30:00.439 --> 30:02.600
B-Because...

30:02.601 --> 30:05.759
Kate, I promised you that there
was nothing to worry about.

30:05.760 --> 30:07.594
And I was wrong.

30:07.595 --> 30:10.364
And I didn't want to give us
yet another reason to fight.

30:10.365 --> 30:13.780
Well, Toby, did you ever
consider she got the wrong idea

30:13.781 --> 30:16.691
because you avoid being home with me?

30:16.692 --> 30:19.527
What? I don't... I don't do that.

30:19.528 --> 30:21.129
Yeah, you do.

30:21.130 --> 30:25.266
Yeah, and I've been
dreading this conversation

30:25.267 --> 30:28.036
the whole party, 'cause I was for sure

30:28.037 --> 30:30.071
that you were gonna tell me
that you had feelings for Kara...

30:30.072 --> 30:31.472
Kah-ra...

30:31.473 --> 30:33.441
and that would have been

30:33.442 --> 30:36.177
the worst thing that I could hear.

30:36.178 --> 30:39.847
But then I would understand
what's happening between us,

30:39.848 --> 30:43.217
and I would understand
why you want to be anywhere

30:43.218 --> 30:45.100
- but here with me and Jack.
- Kate...

30:45.101 --> 30:47.369
I feel you pulling away.

30:51.218 --> 30:52.809
Am I crazy?

30:52.810 --> 30:55.211
N-No.

30:56.994 --> 30:58.261
No, you're not crazy.

31:02.134 --> 31:03.634
This isn't about you, Kate.

31:07.039 --> 31:09.294
All right, I love you to death.

31:09.295 --> 31:12.297
And I love Jack more than anything.

31:12.298 --> 31:15.233
That tension that you're feeling

31:15.234 --> 31:17.235
when I'm home that...

31:19.939 --> 31:22.507
Kate, when you look at our son, I see

31:22.508 --> 31:26.723
pure, unbridled joy in your eyes.

31:26.724 --> 31:28.792
But when I look at our son...

31:30.083 --> 31:33.318
... it just makes me sad.

31:37.490 --> 31:41.860
Sad that he'll never see the ocean.

31:41.861 --> 31:45.063
Sad that he'll never
know what we look like.

31:45.064 --> 31:48.300
Sad that he'll, that he'll never
watch Star Wars with me.

31:48.301 --> 31:51.970
Okay? So, yeah, I
kill myself at the gym,

31:51.971 --> 31:55.829
and I vent to people other than my wife

31:55.830 --> 31:58.699
because I don't want to see that look

31:58.700 --> 32:00.267
that is on your face right now.

32:14.782 --> 32:16.850
Hi. It's Mommy.

32:19.253 --> 32:20.454
Hi. Hi.

32:24.892 --> 32:26.727
Um...

32:26.728 --> 32:29.329
Do you want to know what I
got you for your birthday?

32:34.635 --> 32:37.304
I booked us a few days away with Jack

32:37.305 --> 32:41.742
at a retreat for families
with blind children.

32:43.211 --> 32:45.545
I thought it sounded like

32:45.546 --> 32:48.749
a great thing to do for our family.

32:53.421 --> 32:55.422
Kate.

33:05.767 --> 33:07.768
You were right.

33:09.604 --> 33:11.571
I didn't want to be.

33:13.541 --> 33:19.212
And of course, I did notice things.

33:19.213 --> 33:22.549
Little things.

33:22.550 --> 33:25.952
She couldn't come up with the
word spatula the other day.

33:27.288 --> 33:29.756
Called it a, uh...

33:29.757 --> 33:31.391
... "food flipper".

33:33.594 --> 33:37.464
And I just really needed
to believe that it was just

33:37.465 --> 33:39.599
plain getting older stuff.

33:46.574 --> 33:49.509
Because the idea...

33:51.879 --> 33:54.414
Because the idea of anything
actually being wrong with her...

33:54.415 --> 33:56.416
I know.

33:58.586 --> 34:00.933
I'm gonna take care of her. I promise.

34:00.934 --> 34:02.231
- Okay?
- Yeah.

34:02.232 --> 34:04.758
And I'm gonna track all of
her doctor's appointments,

34:04.759 --> 34:05.959
the medication that they put her on.

34:05.960 --> 34:08.161
- I promise.
- I know.

34:08.161 --> 34:11.031
We're gonna get through this
thing one step at a time.

34:11.032 --> 34:13.366
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

34:13.367 --> 34:16.202
Let's get out of here.

34:16.203 --> 34:17.954
- Yeah.
- Think I was promised

34:17.955 --> 34:19.739
an episode of World of Dance.

34:19.739 --> 34:21.407
Yes, you were. Yes.

34:28.616 --> 34:31.051
Okay, everybody, I'm gonna
take a five-minute break

34:31.052 --> 34:32.452
and I'll be right back out.

34:32.453 --> 34:34.754
Really beautiful, man.

34:34.755 --> 34:38.190
Ooh. Wow. Really used to
playing to more people.

34:38.192 --> 34:40.025
- So...
- I mean...

34:40.027 --> 34:41.839
Tell me, on a, on a scale, one to ten,

34:41.840 --> 34:43.898
how am I ranking on your
best dates ever list?

34:43.899 --> 34:45.831
You're definitely ranking
higher than the guy

34:45.833 --> 34:48.125
who broke up with me
while we were bowling.

34:48.126 --> 34:49.362
- Mm.
- We were mid-game.

34:49.362 --> 34:51.004
Five frames left. He couldn't wait.

34:51.005 --> 34:54.708
But you're not ranking quite
as high as my junior prom date.

34:54.708 --> 34:55.775
- Hmm.
- What can I say?

34:55.775 --> 34:57.711
- Brad was my first love.
- Well,

34:57.712 --> 35:00.547
I'll have to figure out a way
to beat good old Brad, won't I?

35:12.593 --> 35:13.793
I, um...

35:13.794 --> 35:15.028
- You okay?
- I-I can't...

35:15.029 --> 35:16.863
- Okay.
- I can't do this.

35:16.864 --> 35:18.965
I'm sorry. I d...
what, uh... I didn't...

35:18.966 --> 35:24.676
I'm-I'm sorry. I did not
expect t-this to get this far.

35:24.677 --> 35:27.045
I mean, who gets to even,
like, meet their hall pass,

35:27.046 --> 35:28.999
let alone have them
be interested in you?

35:29.000 --> 35:31.601
- And I didn't know...
- I'm sorry, what?

35:32.367 --> 35:35.031
Um...

35:35.032 --> 35:38.234
You know, the one celebrity
that you could sleep with

35:38.235 --> 35:40.569
and it wouldn't count as cheating?

35:43.073 --> 35:45.508
So I'm your, I'm your hall pass?

35:45.509 --> 35:47.737
I saw you earlier and
I texted my husband

35:47.738 --> 35:48.944
and he said to go for it.

35:48.945 --> 35:50.212
But he's been calling all day,

35:50.213 --> 35:51.647
and I think that he's freaking out.

35:51.648 --> 35:53.382
- It's been him, not my mom.
- You're married.

35:53.383 --> 35:54.950
And I just can't...

35:57.988 --> 35:59.455
Yeah.

36:00.657 --> 36:02.024
I'm your hall pass.

36:03.293 --> 36:05.328
- You are amazing.
- Am I?

36:05.329 --> 36:06.729
I mean, really.

36:06.730 --> 36:10.633
- Just so you know.
- Thank you. Thank you.

36:10.634 --> 36:14.503
I'm sorry. I should go.

36:14.504 --> 36:16.105
I'm sorry.

36:17.174 --> 36:18.374
Um...

36:21.111 --> 36:22.311
I'm sorry.

36:22.312 --> 36:23.546
- Thank you.
- I'll tell him.

36:23.547 --> 36:25.081
- Okay.
- Yeah.

36:32.169 --> 36:36.129
Oh, oh, buddy, you, you are perfect.

36:37.250 --> 36:39.685
Have I told you that yet today?

36:45.964 --> 36:48.099
- Toby?
- Yeah?

36:48.100 --> 36:49.300
Toby, come here.

36:49.301 --> 36:50.968
What? What's going on?

36:50.969 --> 36:53.737
He's reaching for the light.

36:53.738 --> 36:55.401
He is reaching for the lights.

36:55.402 --> 36:57.160
The doctor said that
he-he might do that.

36:57.161 --> 36:59.830
He might start to see light and shadows.

37:10.739 --> 37:12.740
Oh...

37:16.745 --> 37:18.780
Hi.

37:39.735 --> 37:41.202
Hey, Kevin, we're ready for you.

37:41.203 --> 37:42.637
- All right.
- I'll walk you over.

37:42.638 --> 37:44.906
Okay.

37:46.508 --> 37:48.343
Kevin's on his way.

37:48.344 --> 37:51.579
Nothing like starting the work
day off at 11:00 p.m., right?

37:51.580 --> 37:54.349
Man, it has been a day, I'm telling you.

37:54.350 --> 37:58.186
Did you know that celebrity
hall passes are actually a thing?

37:58.187 --> 38:00.355
Yeah, I-I thought they were
just, like, urban legend.

38:00.356 --> 38:03.658
You know, like, uh, key parties
or Richard Gere and the gerbil.

38:03.659 --> 38:05.260
But no, people do this stuff.

38:05.261 --> 38:07.095
Probably my fault, though.

38:07.096 --> 38:08.263
You know, I mean, I keep putting myself

38:08.264 --> 38:09.898
in these obviously terrible situations

38:09.899 --> 38:13.429
because I'm so desperate to
have this crazy love story

38:13.430 --> 38:14.435
like what my parents had.

38:14.436 --> 38:16.804
But maybe it's just not
in the cards for me, Noah.

38:16.805 --> 38:18.006
You know what I mean?

38:18.007 --> 38:20.441
Maybe it is just not in the cards.

38:20.442 --> 38:22.076
Here.

38:22.077 --> 38:23.677
Can you take that? I got to concentrate.

38:27.801 --> 38:29.801
_

38:46.568 --> 38:49.604
Uh, hey, Miss, we're
actually about to close.

38:49.605 --> 38:53.508
Sorry, yeah, I'm just,
I'm looking for someone.

38:54.810 --> 38:57.645
Rebecca?

39:01.650 --> 39:04.052
No. I-I talk, you listen.

39:04.053 --> 39:06.721
I don't care about what you can give me.

39:06.722 --> 39:11.326
I don't care if you have a good
job or you come from good stock,

39:11.327 --> 39:13.328
or you're on a good track.

39:13.329 --> 39:15.096
I don't care about any of that stuff.

39:15.097 --> 39:17.899
And whatever my dad told you
about not being good enough

39:17.900 --> 39:20.368
for his precious little daughter,

39:20.369 --> 39:22.036
I want you to forget about all that.

39:23.305 --> 39:25.306
Because...

39:26.342 --> 39:28.743
... I am in love with you, Jack.

39:28.744 --> 39:30.979
You are?

39:30.980 --> 39:33.815
Yeah.

39:33.816 --> 39:35.984
I am.

39:37.987 --> 39:40.288
And you and I?

39:40.289 --> 39:41.689
Oh...

39:41.690 --> 39:43.725
We're gonna have it all together.

39:43.726 --> 39:46.694
We're gonna have the big moments
and the small moments and...

39:46.695 --> 39:51.532
it's gonna be one for the ages.

39:56.939 --> 40:00.241
I can't believe you beat
me to saying "I love you".

40:01.477 --> 40:03.978
Well, you better believe it.

40:06.215 --> 40:10.218
Rebecca Malone, I love you.

40:10.219 --> 40:11.853
Don't you ever forget it.

41:39.308 --> 41:42.910
- Hey, babe.
- Hey.

41:42.911 --> 41:44.312
How you doing?

41:44.313 --> 41:46.948
I'm hanging in there.

41:49.651 --> 41:52.487
I'm gonna grab some water
and then I'm coming to bed.

41:52.488 --> 41:54.021
Okay.

41:54.022 --> 41:56.824
Okay.
