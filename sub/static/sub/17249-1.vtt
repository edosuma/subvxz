A catastrophe can so inexplicable that
the future of humanity is at stake.

At one point an old diary

00:36.493 --> 00:38.791
of the Living Dead for over 100 years ago

00:38.829 --> 00:42.356
A diary can give us the answers
the plague that threatens the human race

00:49.373 --> 00:54.003
I have a secret diary that was passed
for generations in my family

00:54.078 --> 00:57.047
Returning to the American Civil War

00:57.614 --> 01:01.641
A legend with drawings and obscure passages

01:01.685 --> 01:05.143
To tell a story
on the undead

01:05.188 --> 01:07.089
Hidden for decades

01:07.124 --> 01:09.592
Now you may cross the barrier.

01:09.626 --> 01:14.563
Read It's now a warning
as we must guard

01:15.199 --> 01:17.724
In such times

day then my attempt has been accepted

01:37.855 --> 01:41.757
My name is Edward Young

02:27.471 --> 02:30.406
It all started at the end of the war

02:36.146 --> 02:38.740
seemed to be alive

02:39.316 --> 02:41.181
But the soul had been torn off

02:45.822 --> 02:47.619
= And I could not die =

02:48.025 --> 02:49.959
was a monster

03:00.404 --> 03:04.636
This is chapter 1 of
Edward Young: "The output of humanity"

03:08.011 --> 03:09.808
6 years

03:12.382 --> 03:15.351
No! No! No!

03:24.995 --> 03:28.590
For two days I left my family when I left
hunting

03:29.833 --> 03:32.597
I came home to find

03:33.103 --> 03:36.004
My wife became one of them

03:36.039 --> 03:38.701
I have shot and killed

03:42.079 --> 03:44.946
My son Adam now is missing

Adam!

05:40.430 --> 05:43.058
What do you want Edward?

05:43.100 --> 05:45.091
In life - I want?

05:46.336 --> 05:48.600
We all want something

05:48.638 --> 05:50.868
What do you want?

05:55.846 --> 05:57.336
I just want to be a good man

05:59.416 --> 06:02.214
Be good to you... our son

06:05.455 --> 06:07.389
It is everything I want in life

06:14.731 --> 06:16.961
're a good man Edward

07:02.746 --> 07:05.374
Dear Lord Jesus Christ

07:10.220 --> 07:12.814
I leave the body of my wife

07:13.323 --> 07:15.314
Julia Young on the floor

07:19.863 --> 07:22.957
Please guide her and protect
her soul for all eternity

illustrate and document what I'm witnessing

07:52.095 --> 07:54.893
In the event that I am a victim

07:54.931 --> 07:57.491
This will my story untold

07:58.101 --> 08:01.593
From Hell on earth

08:15.886 --> 08:18.719
My patience is thinner making

08:21.591 --> 08:24.321
I go to the field and seeketh

08:59.062 --> 09:03.021
6 shots My gun is ideal for
close proximity situations

09:24.020 --> 09:27.820
Today
I have concluded that all die the same way

09:28.458 --> 09:31.291
A fatal head wound

09:35.832 --> 09:40.735
They move slowly enough
and are an ideal target for my rifle

09:54.050 --> 09:56.780
crossing with my old neighbor Charles

09:58.154 --> 10:00.281
One of them

10:02.025 --> 10:05.620
And as others have no memory of who I am

10:08.398 --> 10:11.333
It seems that just wants to eat

10:18.141 --> 10:21.577
My curiosity extends every day

10:21.611 --> 10:24.307
I'm not sure that senses have

10:25.281 --> 10:26.908
but they can smell

10:27.317 --> 10:29.615
Listen and watch

10:31.021 --> 10:33.489
seem to many like eating meat

10:35.392 --> 10:37.553
Day 9

10:37.594 --> 10:39.619
are afraid to fire

10:39.663 --> 10:41.927
Charles found me in home

10:41.965 --> 10:47.198
Maybe it's my smell or some
form of distant memory

10:47.237 --> 10:51.571
And not like human food

10:52.108 --> 10:54.474
I give little hope and suffering

10:57.614 --> 11:00.913
Death is the only solution

11:04.054 --> 11:08.616
Tomorrow my
horse "Shadow" and I ride

11:08.658 --> 11:11.252
Taking my search beyond home

12:03.680 --> 12:05.841
If... more of them

12:10.153 --> 12:11.552
I was wrong today

12:12.288 --> 12:15.314
clash with the corpse of a young child

12:18.862 --> 12:21.160
eaten the body are spoken

12:21.731 --> 12:24.894
And I'm grateful that my son was not

12:39.516 --> 12:43.919
read earlier today, I expect impatiently

12:46.422 --> 12:48.822
Because it is happening this?

12:50.226 --> 12:52.456
That disease is behind all this?

17:10.386 --> 17:12.877
Had my son 11 years

17:15.258 --> 17:18.694
now sent him to eternal rest

17:24.967 --> 17:27.935
The sound of my heartbeat

17:27.970 --> 17:31.406
is decreased with the
burning flames of my son

21:38.821 --> 21:41.255
Because these punishing me?!

21:42.692 --> 21:45.160
The devil has challenged you?!

22:43.552 --> 22:49.184
Had a family...
a man as a husband

22:49.525 --> 22:52.119
As a parent...

22:52.161 --> 22:55.892
There is no way to heal

22:55.931 --> 22:58.195
To or that it's done

23:33.669 --> 23:36.900
Hey man!

23:36.939 --> 23:39.271
Can not sleep?
- No

23:41.043 --> 23:43.568
I do not, come

23:50.686 --> 23:52.779
All my long years of war

23:54.323 --> 23:55.847
kept this with me

23:56.425 --> 23:59.258
This cataract gave peace to your daddy

24:00.229 --> 24:01.992
Where is Dad?

24:02.031 --> 24:04.591
It's very far from here

24:08.471 --> 24:10.701
Can we go there?

24:16.479 --> 24:18.538
Promise to take me

24:22.718 --> 24:24.686
I promise

24:26.689 --> 24:29.556
Go sleep, shall we?
- Ok

24:29.592 --> 24:31.992
Pope Goodnight - Goodnight

24:58.220 --> 25:03.055
I made a promise, my
last task in this life

25:06.362 --> 25:09.957
I would take the ashes of
my daughter to the Falls

25:09.999 --> 25:12.467
And liberate

26:01.617 --> 26:05.519
I come with the fury of death
killing death itself

26:06.155 --> 26:08.123
Bloodthirsty

26:08.157 --> 26:10.717
Ride for what seemed hundreds of years

26:13.362 --> 26:15.796
One night I was attacked by a mob

26:17.366 --> 26:19.800
bitten Shadow

26:26.609 --> 26:28.042
= = the wound is infected

26:30.279 --> 26:32.804
has lost the desire to run

26:37.152 --> 26:38.710
This painfully

26:39.555 --> 26:41.648
I'm worried

26:54.269 --> 26:56.499
is clear that can not continue

26:58.974 --> 27:01.909
Caminare with el

27:04.480 --> 27:07.040
The only friend who me
remained in this world

27:08.717 --> 27:11.652
A friend that was always there for me

27:12.221 --> 27:14.815
Never gave me the back

27:21.964 --> 27:24.797
Do not wait for that wake up in the virus

27:27.202 --> 27:31.036
I know what to do

28:03.338 --> 28:06.796
goodbye my friend

28:52.387 --> 28:55.914
found many corpses in Falls Dallas

28:57.159 --> 28:59.992
I'm a little weak in ammunition

29:00.529 --> 29:03.623
I've run into an old people

30:51.106 --> 30:52.903
bit you?

30:54.142 --> 30:56.007
No

30:56.411 --> 30:58.777
someone else with you?

31:00.549 --> 31:02.574
No - do you want?

31:03.318 --> 31:05.081
I came here to find food and shelter

31:06.321 --> 31:08.721
That's all

31:08.757 --> 31:10.657
'll kill you where you stand

31:12.427 --> 31:14.952
You can not kill a man
who is already dead

31:16.531 --> 31:19.159
I killed many men already
dead

31:58.874 --> 32:00.842
Now what?

32:05.347 --> 32:07.645
Okay...

32:20.696 --> 32:22.687
Quiet

32:22.764 --> 32:25.494
Quiet - Where are my things?

32:26.368 --> 32:28.598
It's all here

32:28.637 --> 32:30.502
Everything is right here

32:33.108 --> 32:34.632
That's my gun?

32:38.480 --> 32:40.675
I guess it is

32:47.489 --> 32:49.787
What happened?

32:49.825 --> 32:51.816
I think you resbalaste

32:53.562 --> 32:55.325
And you fainted

33:05.874 --> 33:07.808
This is your house?

33:08.744 --> 33:10.974
It is now

33:13.281 --> 33:17.377
I've been here a while, small but fortified

33:19.321 --> 33:21.619
Pumpkins are all that remains

33:21.656 --> 33:23.521
chickens and other animals fled

33:23.558 --> 33:25.788
O were bitten

33:25.827 --> 33:28.455
For these creatures

33:28.864 --> 33:31.025
Always good to have a drink

33:32.467 --> 33:34.628
a sip

33:36.038 --> 33:37.733
Let

33:37.773 --> 33:39.832
you need to have some strength

33:50.585 --> 33:52.746
My name is Isaac

34:04.399 --> 34:06.697
Edward Young

34:14.876 --> 34:16.639
'Cause you help me?

34:16.678 --> 34:19.078
At first I was going to eat

34:19.981 --> 34:24.645
But these skinny as a foal so that...
not have much to eat

34:26.188 --> 34:30.215
Then I found this horrible book...
With pictures, only I was watching

34:30.292 --> 34:32.021
I can not even read

34:36.297 --> 34:38.027
It's all there

34:40.735 --> 34:42.668
NO touches more things

34:44.406 --> 34:48.433
You could have drawn some
tits there, if you do not mind my saying so

34:54.081 --> 34:56.414
You say
this is not your house, where are you?!

34:57.085 --> 34:59.519
Grew only 10 miles from here

35:00.789 --> 35:05.453
My mom and dad... that good that the
good Lord do not let live to see this

35:12.534 --> 35:14.092
what's your story?

35:14.169 --> 35:15.397
Edward Young

35:15.437 --> 35:18.668
You're not from around here, I can account

35:19.307 --> 35:21.741
I have been away for some time

35:23.378 --> 35:26.040
was something I had to do

35:26.081 --> 35:28.276
It has something to do with that book?

35:30.185 --> 35:32.050
Kind

35:32.087 --> 35:33.418
You were at war

35:34.656 --> 35:36.590
Yes sir

35:42.531 --> 35:45.056
You could use a guy like you

35:46.835 --> 35:48.530
I'm not your friend

36:00.148 --> 36:01.877
It's my sister

36:01.917 --> 36:03.817
Has been carried

36:03.852 --> 36:05.649
Taken by whom?

36:06.388 --> 36:08.413
A guy named Williams

36:08.890 --> 36:11.154
have ever met a rebel sir?

36:11.193 --> 36:15.425
Raping, killing, abducting
all field

36:16.665 --> 36:19.190
The rumor is that there is a cure

36:22.204 --> 36:23.728
There is no cure

36:26.141 --> 36:28.302
Sleep

36:28.643 --> 36:30.770
Look...

36:34.749 --> 36:37.479
Are underground tunnels

36:37.519 --> 36:39.180
And I know like the palm of my hand

36:39.654 --> 36:41.622
For that helps build

36:42.891 --> 36:44.859
I wish you luck

36:49.564 --> 36:51.657
not going to help me?

36:51.700 --> 36:53.793
I can not even help myself

37:09.150 --> 37:11.118
think are here?

37:11.786 --> 37:13.219
I know that if

37:14.756 --> 37:17.190
They are vicious men

37:18.226 --> 37:21.923
Men with whom we fought

37:21.963 --> 37:23.931
who collided with swords

37:27.435 --> 37:30.063
I guess Williams has met with the devil

37:30.972 --> 37:33.440
He does not have one bit of humanity

37:35.076 --> 37:38.136
Lost so many men with
Yankees that he corrupted the soul

37:39.381 --> 37:41.872
The war continues

37:42.384 --> 37:45.649
There are only the two types and more

37:47.455 --> 37:49.514
Wayne

37:49.557 --> 37:52.924
He is always there on the side of General

37:52.961 --> 37:54.588
He does what you asked to do

37:54.629 --> 37:58.224
His heart is black and has no soul

38:01.036 --> 38:02.367
Corporolly

38:02.971 --> 38:07.840
is a coward, killed his own father
to gain the confidence General

38:13.448 --> 38:15.473
have a sergeant

38:15.517 --> 38:17.883
= = I called Johnson

38:18.486 --> 38:21.284
have a dumb idea where
believe they can control these things

38:22.657 --> 38:26.684
and restore some order

38:28.396 --> 38:31.092
These men are not even close to
what really happens

38:31.633 --> 38:33.692
no longer think more

38:35.270 --> 38:37.431
Edward I need your help

38:38.006 --> 38:40.474
I can not go there without.

38:40.508 --> 38:42.908
Along with my gun in hand

38:45.246 --> 38:48.682
I need Edward, she's my girl

38:52.120 --> 38:54.645
My blood
- You have children?

38:55.924 --> 38:57.414
No more

38:59.961 --> 39:02.862
I have nothing more in this world so
or her

39:06.668 --> 39:08.568
She's all I have left

39:10.271 --> 39:12.762
Save your damn life!

39:13.441 --> 39:15.773
Remember?!

39:16.411 --> 39:18.971
Look at me!

39:19.013 --> 39:20.844
You're a coward

39:20.915 --> 39:24.442
can not even call yourself a man

39:32.160 --> 39:33.627
I think not

39:46.608 --> 39:48.576
by Edward

39:59.421 --> 40:01.855
sure seems that Isaac

40:03.491 --> 40:06.551
I feel some truth in the

40:07.095 --> 40:11.532
It reminds me that one can even
find the light in the Darkness

40:16.538 --> 40:19.234
we have a common interest

40:20.208 --> 40:23.336
The two were looking for something our

40:27.715 --> 40:32.243
Among all were willing to kill for the o

41:18.333 --> 41:22.861
We were on stage
's attempt to rescue the sister of Isaac

41:23.371 --> 41:27.205
I feel that speaks hope cloudy

41:27.242 --> 41:30.177
I fear has passed away

41:41.990 --> 41:43.890
Luckily I found yours

41:45.527 --> 41:48.792
man alive or dead who can kill me

41:51.199 --> 41:52.757
Is that true?

41:54.135 --> 41:55.932
True

42:00.341 --> 42:02.901
Edward're a good man?

42:07.348 --> 42:09.873
No

42:11.286 --> 42:13.982
you ever been a good man?

42:23.898 --> 42:25.798
My child

42:32.140 --> 42:34.472
A bitch told me my future
once said that my fate

42:34.509 --> 42:36.875
was found to last
good man on earth

42:42.083 --> 42:44.176
not me

42:48.523 --> 42:50.457
Well...

42:52.493 --> 42:54.552
If that is out there

42:55.463 --> 42:57.397
Can I find

43:02.570 --> 43:04.765
What else did he say?

43:05.740 --> 43:07.435
Nothing

43:07.909 --> 43:10.707
Her eyes turned black and try to bite

43:10.745 --> 43:13.179
So I fucking head explode

43:20.154 --> 43:21.917
I will go to the bathroom

43:44.078 --> 43:45.909
Hello boy

43:45.947 --> 43:47.812
What are you doing here?

43:47.849 --> 43:49.441
Solo?

43:50.952 --> 43:52.852
Got something to me?

44:05.566 --> 44:07.557
What have we here?

44:07.602 --> 44:09.797
What's your name son?

44:09.837 --> 44:12.101
No matter who

44:14.942 --> 44:18.378
I said what's your name boy?

44:22.316 --> 44:26.150
Edward Young - well Edward are alone?

44:26.788 --> 44:29.052
These alone here?

44:32.393 --> 44:34.793
These single guy?

44:34.829 --> 44:37.229
I used to fight with us?

44:38.499 --> 44:41.093
It seems that we have nothing
to fight about in our hands

44:42.837 --> 44:44.737
You know who I am?

44:44.772 --> 44:46.831
I ask you something

44:47.508 --> 44:49.135
General Williams

44:50.878 --> 44:53.210
Williams was General

44:54.816 --> 44:58.650
Check his stuff - If you touch my stuff...

45:03.057 --> 45:05.082
What is there?

45:05.126 --> 45:07.356
A piece of shit

45:12.800 --> 45:15.667
Yes
you have guts to be out here your so o

45:18.306 --> 45:21.673
The rumor says that someone
this part is immune

45:21.709 --> 45:23.802
a pest that is here

45:23.845 --> 45:27.906
And where there there
is a chance for a cure

45:30.151 --> 45:32.142
Have you ever been bitten?

45:42.630 --> 45:45.326
Because they will not play their
game of war somewhere else?

45:49.070 --> 45:51.004
Well...

45:55.576 --> 45:58.807
Son
had chosen my words more wisely

45:59.313 --> 46:02.749
You'll be a great volunteer

46:14.929 --> 46:16.624
up!

46:16.664 --> 46:18.859
Hurry

46:24.005 --> 46:26.098
Watch your step boy and shut up!

46:26.741 --> 46:28.641
Wayne!

47:06.814 --> 47:08.873
How the hell you get here?

47:12.553 --> 47:15.545
We will take one to one

47:15.990 --> 47:17.855
to see who can survive

47:38.613 --> 47:40.877
If so survive or end up like the rest

47:45.653 --> 47:47.951
A living dead

47:52.260 --> 47:54.091
How long are you here?

47:57.398 --> 47:59.764
A couple of weeks

47:59.800 --> 48:02.291
I lost track of time

49:09.570 --> 49:11.595
Silence!

49:12.173 --> 49:14.403
Do not wanna hear a sound more!

49:16.644 --> 49:20.478
You in the dress! If you!

49:22.383 --> 49:24.613
Then return for you

49:48.676 --> 49:50.473
Lord

49:52.813 --> 49:55.941
Well...

49:56.450 --> 49:59.419
Any of my treatments are working

50:01.255 --> 50:03.985
We are in a dead end

50:04.025 --> 50:06.789
supposed to have immunity

50:07.428 --> 50:11.194
Has been dead for weeks
and nothing has changed

50:13.100 --> 50:17.059
Now the only thing that is
that the infection is caused by...

50:17.638 --> 50:19.765
By bloodstream

50:20.374 --> 50:22.569
Other than that everything is beyond my
Science

50:24.745 --> 50:27.339
still wants meat

50:27.381 --> 50:30.578
And I'm beginning to lose my faith

50:31.152 --> 50:34.178
Do not tell me you're losing faith

50:34.755 --> 50:36.916
Listen to this before

50:37.858 --> 50:42.227
It is a disease that
out of control, a plague

50:43.898 --> 50:46.696
You keep telling me the same information

50:49.904 --> 50:53.362
Well trying to tell you
that this is not human

50:53.908 --> 50:56.240
not natural

50:56.277 --> 50:59.246
This goes
beyond what I understand I'm scared!

50:59.280 --> 51:01.475
This is not supernatural!

51:01.515 --> 51:03.415
It is made by men

51:03.451 --> 51:06.284
and there is a cure

51:06.320 --> 51:10.916
And if you do not find you I personally
alimentare those walking dead

51:11.692 --> 51:13.292
I mean?

51:25.873 --> 51:29.274
All men are afraid of something

51:29.743 --> 51:33.110
It is fear that has kept us alive
the two so long

51:35.549 --> 51:38.780
you better recompongas Johnson

51:38.819 --> 51:40.946
I hope you continue being afraid

51:45.693 --> 51:47.558
Now returns to work

52:03.811 --> 52:07.269
Wear this dress with which Johnson

52:08.015 --> 52:09.812
Hurry!

52:13.187 --> 52:15.280
Stand woman - Take me

52:16.423 --> 52:19.187
Idiot

52:22.429 --> 52:24.727
Let alone

52:24.765 --> 52:26.733
Be a man

52:34.341 --> 52:36.673
Emma!
- Isaac

52:43.050 --> 52:44.779
I'm fine!

52:48.255 --> 52:49.847
I told you you were lucky

53:25.125 --> 53:26.922
What the hell was that?

53:29.029 --> 53:32.556
Hey! Hey! They are escaping!

53:32.933 --> 53:34.924
Go! Run!

53:37.104 --> 53:38.833
Come on Edward!

53:59.460 --> 54:01.621
Stop!

54:01.662 --> 54:03.527
We gotta get out of here!

54:20.714 --> 54:24.115
Emma come on, hurry up!

54:24.151 --> 54:25.846
I'm coming!

54:35.095 --> 54:38.087
For the color of your eyelids I realize

54:38.132 --> 54:39.895
that is in poor condition

54:39.933 --> 54:43.027
Home is just a few miles from here

54:44.004 --> 54:46.234
The house was burned!

54:57.017 --> 54:58.712
Where are we going!

55:00.154 --> 55:02.918
Let us moving! We lift it up

55:04.458 --> 55:07.222
go! Grab your bags!

55:31.785 --> 55:34.982
Where we're taking?
- When we were children speak a house

55:35.022 --> 55:37.923
remember?
The people called Stone Mountain

55:37.958 --> 55:39.755
Where the evil witch?

55:39.793 --> 55:42.489
Are you crazy?
- Well if you live maybe I can help

55:43.330 --> 55:46.458
If he is alive is because it has
made a pact with the devil himself

55:46.500 --> 55:48.434
I do not think Isaac...

55:48.469 --> 55:50.664
In addition to choice do we have?

55:50.704 --> 55:52.763
Keep on rockin 'going

55:52.806 --> 55:55.536
we have to follow the

56:12.159 --> 56:14.252
Oh my God!

56:16.497 --> 56:18.590
That's

56:19.900 --> 56:22.095
Is there

56:22.136 --> 56:23.728
God is not here

56:23.771 --> 56:25.671
go!

56:39.586 --> 56:41.577
Hello?

56:41.622 --> 56:43.613
I have a friend who is badly wounded!

56:44.091 --> 56:45.752
Need immediate help

56:46.527 --> 56:48.688
I know you are here please!

56:48.729 --> 56:50.663
Please I beg you!

56:54.001 --> 56:55.696
Please!

57:02.342 --> 57:04.776
No one is here!

57:17.758 --> 57:19.726
Emma!

57:20.761 --> 57:22.956
Emma! Emma!

57:22.996 --> 57:26.056
Emma!
- I can not leave!

57:26.099 --> 57:28.431
Emma! Open this door!

57:28.469 --> 57:31.438
Isaac Open the door!
- Because I bother?

57:35.709 --> 57:37.267
I do not want to hurt women

57:37.811 --> 57:41.178
We need help, our
friend is badly wounded

57:41.215 --> 57:43.979
Bitch! Do not hurt!

57:48.222 --> 57:52.352
Open the door!

57:52.960 --> 57:55.087
I'm just a girl!

57:55.128 --> 57:58.063
I'm sorry

58:05.072 --> 58:07.472
Emma!
- Isaac put the gun down!

58:07.508 --> 58:10.238
She will help us
- hurt you? - No!

58:11.211 --> 58:13.145
Bring it

58:19.052 --> 58:20.952
Watch your head

58:22.222 --> 58:23.746
Move

58:24.625 --> 58:27.355
This cold, put it up

58:28.161 --> 58:31.597
Take boy drink it because it
will remove some of the pain

58:32.733 --> 58:35.065
Do not do a spell!

58:35.102 --> 58:36.592
Okay

58:40.340 --> 58:42.706
OK

58:42.743 --> 58:45.473
Open your mouth and bite it

58:45.512 --> 58:47.503
This is going to hurt

58:47.548 --> 58:49.413
You give me that box!

58:57.891 --> 59:00.257
Okay here we go!

59:07.634 --> 59:10.102
What are doing?
- She is only helping

59:12.573 --> 59:14.939
Okay

59:23.717 --> 59:27.380
Okay, someone followed them here?

59:28.455 --> 59:30.013
Do not Know

59:30.057 --> 59:31.422
I do not think

59:35.062 --> 59:36.791
will survive?

59:39.266 --> 59:41.257
Has lost much blood

59:41.301 --> 59:44.168
If the wound becomes infected if you die

59:44.738 --> 59:46.569
must rest

59:57.951 --> 59:59.816
I remember my mother told me about it...

59:59.886 --> 01:00:02.946
Emma! No!
- I said what happened

01:00:10.030 --> 01:00:12.498
Your mother does not know anything about me

01:00:13.834 --> 01:00:16.166
And you do not

01:00:16.203 --> 01:00:19.070
It's a fucking bitch!
- Please!

01:00:20.674 --> 01:00:22.972
I do not speak more

01:00:51.705 --> 01:00:53.900
help it heal faster

01:00:58.345 --> 01:01:00.643
thanks

01:01:06.620 --> 01:01:09.851
I have not felt in years thanks

01:01:12.726 --> 01:01:14.956
It's nice to feel needed

01:01:15.996 --> 01:01:17.657
Again

01:01:39.586 --> 01:01:42.612
There are only two of these holes

01:01:43.090 --> 01:01:47.390
Some spend but many fall
I have no strength I used to have

01:01:47.427 --> 01:01:50.590
are welcome to stay
healthy while your friend

01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:53.155
Grab a shovel

01:02:00.273 --> 01:02:02.764
If you ever pass these bells will ring

01:02:02.809 --> 01:02:07.610
If you hear bells is because they are close

01:02:28.769 --> 01:02:31.363
We stayed here for a while

01:02:35.408 --> 01:02:38.673
I guess the hope is patient

01:02:42.649 --> 01:02:44.810
I trusted Eve

01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:50.012
She did a miracle

01:02:50.056 --> 01:02:53.150
and I'm thankful

01:03:09.009 --> 01:03:10.909
I can sit?

01:03:12.846 --> 01:03:14.780
Of course, if

01:03:22.088 --> 01:03:25.421
Isaac told me about your wife and son

01:03:33.266 --> 01:03:36.235
It will get better than this Edward

01:03:37.137 --> 01:03:39.332
must be something better

01:03:45.178 --> 01:03:48.113
I stay with the ashes of my son

01:03:51.184 --> 01:03:54.051
It's all I have left in this life

01:03:56.623 --> 01:03:59.490
I know what it's like
to lose people you love

01:04:03.063 --> 01:04:05.657
Everything happens so fast

01:04:06.933 --> 01:04:10.494
Before
we can continue to absorb what's happening

01:04:11.271 --> 01:04:13.330
everyone was already walking dead

01:04:16.910 --> 01:04:20.676
But I thank the lord
that I have yet to Isaac

01:04:21.781 --> 01:04:23.749
And Eve

01:04:24.784 --> 01:04:26.684
And you

01:04:37.898 --> 01:04:40.196
There time

01:04:42.302 --> 01:04:45.863
Where just wanted to get the next day

01:04:51.211 --> 01:04:54.647
I thought it would survive the worst days

01:04:58.018 --> 01:05:01.818
No one should teach you to like
take the life of another man

01:05:03.523 --> 01:05:07.482
but you learn to do it and live with that

01:05:14.367 --> 01:05:17.928
= = How are supposed to
learn to live with myself

01:05:18.838 --> 01:05:20.863
Knowing the things I've done?

01:05:23.643 --> 01:05:27.477
Knowing that I can do

01:05:30.984 --> 01:05:34.283
This is humanity I have left

01:05:41.962 --> 01:05:44.362
And I need an outlet

01:06:10.523 --> 01:06:14.653
Isaac was always watching

01:06:15.495 --> 01:06:18.896
Always on guard waiting

01:06:19.666 --> 01:06:22.157
anxious to defend

01:06:28.341 --> 01:06:33.836
As we put a
light to a world of darkness

01:06:35.048 --> 01:06:38.506
Is our pain, our strength

01:06:39.119 --> 01:06:43.112
our truth is

01:06:43.490 --> 01:06:46.550
It is our desire

01:06:46.926 --> 01:06:49.952
These are our questions and our faith

01:06:53.666 --> 01:06:56.897
despite the years of exile

01:06:56.936 --> 01:07:01.964
Eve felt in nature, it will
recalled

01:07:02.008 --> 01:07:05.341
Whoever she was

01:07:12.585 --> 01:07:14.815
lost count of the Day

01:07:22.429 --> 01:07:27.594
And when the days passed,
we all kept hoping

01:07:28.468 --> 01:07:32.632
and praying that all this would end soon

01:07:36.576 --> 01:07:39.909
attacks were frequent The
most nights we could not rest

01:07:41.047 --> 01:07:43.174
and felt at the door

01:07:46.286 --> 01:07:49.119
're coming by the back of the cabin!

01:07:50.323 --> 01:07:52.689
Behind you!

01:07:52.725 --> 01:07:56.058
Eve was telling us that
time will tell the truth

01:07:56.096 --> 01:07:59.691
And us to embrace every moment

01:08:02.936 --> 01:08:04.836
Edward!

01:08:12.645 --> 01:08:20.645
We were afraid that
Williams and his men are looking for us

01:08:22.988 --> 01:08:27.187
even if their resources are thin

01:08:33.299 --> 01:08:35.790
Eve do not talk much most of the time

01:08:35.835 --> 01:08:40.636
It was his way... although it
seemed that he was hiding something

01:08:55.220 --> 01:08:58.850
The night that changed us all

01:08:58.892 --> 01:09:02.658
The night that changed everything

01:09:17.577 --> 01:09:20.205
Emma has been bitten!
- No! I'm fine

01:09:21.881 --> 01:09:23.849
I'm fine!

01:09:27.654 --> 01:09:29.952
Jesus!
- I'm fine!

01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:36.529
Isaac put the gun down, put the gun!

01:09:36.563 --> 01:09:38.962
I know you do not want this

01:09:38.997 --> 01:09:41.330
do not want - Yes! I have to do!

01:09:41.367 --> 01:09:44.063
Emma go outside!
Not gonna let you become!

01:09:44.103 --> 01:09:47.300
Demons!
I can not become one of those?!

01:09:48.408 --> 01:09:50.740
Already bitten me before!

01:09:50.777 --> 01:09:54.338
Bite me for weeks so stop shouting
of you!

01:10:04.257 --> 01:10:07.590
I can see the scar?

01:10:13.299 --> 01:10:16.166
And are you sure it was one of those?

01:10:17.804 --> 01:10:19.931
Before they came soldiers

01:10:19.973 --> 01:10:22.669
I was taking care of our
sick neighbor mr. Griffin

01:10:24.277 --> 01:10:26.905
and bit me

01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:29.714
A few days passed and nothing

01:10:29.749 --> 01:10:32.047
never even felt it

01:10:32.885 --> 01:10:37.288
Know... Ios days have passed and my eyes
have not seen anything like this!

01:10:37.790 --> 01:10:39.883
Yes she is right

01:10:40.860 --> 01:10:43.988
Our daddy always said you were special

01:10:45.098 --> 01:10:48.966
but look...
- Famous not so fast

01:10:49.602 --> 01:10:51.934
A cure, say

01:10:51.971 --> 01:10:56.032
there are larger forces
than were ever here know

01:10:58.044 --> 01:10:59.978
And they know nothing

01:12:29.469 --> 01:12:31.460
What about Eve?

01:12:31.504 --> 01:12:33.995
Edward...

01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:39.009
Lived for years with my sister

01:12:39.045 --> 01:12:42.811
It was very different from my... she was...

01:12:43.149 --> 01:12:45.743
Younger

01:12:48.588 --> 01:12:53.685
one night two men were drinking in a bar
followed home

01:12:56.229 --> 01:12:58.663
And they took their innocence

01:12:59.232 --> 01:13:04.829
I look pregnant and I was
in the business of medicine

01:13:04.871 --> 01:13:08.602
Y knew someone who could end fertility

01:13:08.641 --> 01:13:10.836
Villagers

01:13:11.677 --> 01:13:13.736
They learned it

01:13:14.514 --> 01:13:17.608
accused of murder

01:13:22.955 --> 01:13:26.948
= =
I I went to a priest who was a friend

01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:31.956
And his father offered to the people

01:13:33.032 --> 01:13:37.969
I was there, was there hanged
when my sister

01:13:38.438 --> 01:13:41.305
With the rest of the people

01:13:41.340 --> 01:13:44.468
And was so full of anger

01:13:44.510 --> 01:13:49.413
And with so much hate yell
curses against those people

01:13:49.449 --> 01:13:52.612
And I yelled to the village priest

01:13:54.086 --> 01:13:56.611
After that I was banished

01:13:57.056 --> 01:13:59.354
I began to be isolated

01:14:01.694 --> 01:14:06.324
not even give me 24
hours to leave the village

01:14:06.732 --> 01:14:09.860
walk for days in the forest

01:14:10.470 --> 01:14:12.597
With cold and hungry

01:14:12.638 --> 01:14:14.663
With only the clothes on her back

01:14:16.108 --> 01:14:18.872
Devastated

01:14:19.245 --> 01:14:22.646
And I found a woman in the woods

01:14:25.918 --> 01:14:28.113
She welcomed me and comforted me

01:14:29.388 --> 01:14:34.690
This was his home
she got back into balance

01:14:35.995 --> 01:14:37.519
I take my anger

01:14:38.064 --> 01:14:42.398
And my need for revenge against these
people that my sister murderer

01:14:47.740 --> 01:14:51.267
But then Melinda died

01:14:51.944 --> 01:14:55.175
And I just...

01:14:57.817 --> 01:15:00.342
Go inside Edward

01:15:00.987 --> 01:15:03.854
I'll show you something

01:15:06.492 --> 01:15:10.223
She had among his possessions
, these ancient rituals

01:15:10.263 --> 01:15:12.322
What are centuries

01:15:12.365 --> 01:15:15.857
One of them as old

01:15:15.902 --> 01:15:18.029
That could revive the dead

01:15:18.070 --> 01:15:20.470
bringing them back to life

01:15:21.507 --> 01:15:24.670
I began studying these rituals

01:15:28.481 --> 01:15:32.383
My sister was buried outside the village

01:15:34.020 --> 01:15:36.250
While I knew this

01:15:36.789 --> 01:15:39.883
brought her home where
run Curse

01:15:39.926 --> 01:15:43.692
hours passed and nothing happened

01:15:44.297 --> 01:15:46.561
Let a bell at his side

01:15:47.266 --> 01:15:49.166
That afternoon nap

01:15:50.336 --> 01:15:53.328
And when I lift the bell rang violently

01:15:54.006 --> 01:15:58.238
Enter to see my sister stop

01:15:59.679 --> 01:16:02.341
against door

01:16:04.717 --> 01:16:06.514
And his body...

01:16:10.022 --> 01:16:13.253
She was alive

01:16:13.659 --> 01:16:17.254
My heart was beating very strongly

01:16:17.296 --> 01:16:19.924
I was standing back

01:16:20.700 --> 01:16:24.067
Soon after that everything
started victims begin

01:16:24.670 --> 01:16:26.661
The dead came to life

01:16:28.507 --> 01:16:31.670
I release the poison

01:16:34.580 --> 01:16:37.447
're saying

01:16:39.619 --> 01:16:43.111
Are you saying that you
are responsible for this?

01:16:45.491 --> 01:16:47.857
I'm

01:16:53.799 --> 01:16:57.326
I lost my wife for this disease

01:16:58.804 --> 01:17:01.364
I lost my son

01:17:05.277 --> 01:17:08.269
My heart is dead

01:17:08.781 --> 01:17:11.443
Stop being the man who used to be

01:17:13.119 --> 01:17:15.212
I understand your pain

01:17:15.254 --> 01:17:17.586
Do not you can talk about pain with a
man who has no heart...

01:17:17.623 --> 01:17:22.856
Trying to forget someone to frame your life is
like trying remember someone you never knew

01:17:26.465 --> 01:17:31.061
I am sorry for all
what I did to your family

01:17:31.103 --> 01:17:32.968
And this world

01:17:42.715 --> 01:17:45.684
It's like you said

01:17:46.052 --> 01:17:49.749
The pain reminds us we're still alive

01:17:59.532 --> 01:18:02.330
Eve revealed more and more spells

01:18:02.368 --> 01:18:05.769
The history of leisure

01:18:06.205 --> 01:18:09.140
reaches hundreds of years across cultures

01:18:09.175 --> 01:18:11.735
countries and religions

01:18:12.812 --> 01:18:15.906
= = a blessed man in an African tribe

01:18:15.948 --> 01:18:20.817
believed that eating a living person
could bring the dead back to life

01:18:22.988 --> 01:18:24.546
1200 years after

01:18:24.590 --> 01:18:27.889
Europeans discovered ancient skulls

01:18:28.794 --> 01:18:31.558
buried in the late 15

01:18:36.602 --> 01:18:40.197
Again
were men who played at being gods

01:18:40.639 --> 01:18:44.370
following the process of divine creation
exploration

01:18:47.613 --> 01:18:50.514
Thousands were stolen from their lives

01:18:51.050 --> 01:18:53.348
And their souls

01:18:53.385 --> 01:18:56.377
All undead

01:18:56.422 --> 01:19:00.188
were connected,
only 250 years later

01:19:00.259 --> 01:19:03.251
third discovery was on a boat

01:19:04.897 --> 01:19:10.096
These boats were full of these creatures

01:19:10.136 --> 01:19:12.070
Who spread the disease

01:19:12.104 --> 01:19:14.504
by 7 months

01:19:15.407 --> 01:19:19.468
evil continued spreading
but with their own power

01:19:19.512 --> 01:19:22.504
and those who questioned
his power over others

01:19:22.548 --> 01:19:25.574
had a islands south were taken

01:19:25.618 --> 01:19:30.146
are not alone in this, but
our place was isolated

01:19:42.935 --> 01:19:45.733
These are filling holes
we have to keep moving

01:19:46.539 --> 01:19:49.372
This is my home

01:19:51.677 --> 01:19:53.941
We have no ammunition

01:19:57.950 --> 01:19:59.645
= = is where they can get all
the ammunition they need

01:20:01.420 --> 01:20:03.888
Are you crazy girl?

01:20:06.258 --> 01:20:07.725
She's right

01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:11.127
You and I can do

01:21:58.203 --> 01:22:00.728
I have to leave tomorrow for a while

01:22:02.141 --> 01:22:04.336
now?

01:22:05.144 --> 01:22:06.839
Why now?
- Emma!

01:22:06.879 --> 01:22:08.346
Let

01:22:30.069 --> 01:22:31.832
want to go with you?

01:22:34.707 --> 01:22:36.971
It is something I have to do myself

01:22:39.111 --> 01:22:40.908
Be assured

01:22:42.848 --> 01:22:44.941
I never liked you like

01:22:55.194 --> 01:22:56.684
thee well

01:22:57.596 --> 01:22:59.723
thanks

01:23:19.485 --> 01:23:21.851
Edward wait!

01:23:25.024 --> 01:23:27.049
Watch

01:23:27.559 --> 01:23:29.959
I will be careful

01:23:32.498 --> 01:23:34.693
I'm going back

01:24:22.481 --> 01:24:27.180
Trees... the smell of the forest

01:24:30.823 --> 01:24:34.816
It is amazing how nature can continue

01:24:35.194 --> 01:24:37.094
Amidst all this horror

01:24:47.339 --> 01:24:52.367
for the first time in ages
I began to feel alive again

01:24:54.413 --> 01:24:58.144
The let you go, once were Men

01:24:59.952 --> 01:25:02.648
Men with families and loved ones

01:25:05.491 --> 01:25:09.188
immunity Emma is a true sign of hope

01:25:11.497 --> 01:25:13.624
If?

01:25:17.503 --> 01:25:21.064
I found that indicated Mr.

01:25:23.408 --> 01:25:26.241
Where?
- It was with troublemakers

01:25:26.278 --> 01:25:29.509
're in a cabin in the mountains

01:25:57.042 --> 01:25:59.374
The time has come

01:26:00.913 --> 01:26:04.906
going to do an orderly society

01:26:26.672 --> 01:26:29.971
now... wait here was a prize

01:26:30.008 --> 01:26:32.568
It's news we all have been waiting here

01:26:33.579 --> 01:26:38.949
seems that a lady is immune to this curse

01:26:42.287 --> 01:26:44.380
The world is full of pain

01:26:45.290 --> 01:26:47.815
I guess it always has been

01:26:49.328 --> 01:26:52.525
but they are the little things that make
go ahead

01:26:53.899 --> 01:26:58.336
The people around us remind
us that we are alive

01:27:01.106 --> 01:27:05.372
This is where I found peace and sanctuary
during the war

01:27:06.411 --> 01:27:10.780
This time I am not alone

01:27:11.984 --> 01:27:15.852
the troublemakers took to the
woods to the hut of a witch

01:27:47.619 --> 01:27:50.611
a big funeral in a church not

01:27:56.028 --> 01:28:00.226
release my son

01:28:00.632 --> 01:28:03.362
I was always at his side General

01:28:03.402 --> 01:28:05.097
When we us?

01:28:06.872 --> 01:28:08.840
The patience will be rewarded

01:28:10.142 --> 01:28:12.440
The time is now

01:28:13.412 --> 01:28:16.176
It is a supernatural force

01:28:16.214 --> 01:28:19.047
We can not do this

01:28:20.519 --> 01:28:23.682
What do we
divided in such times?

01:28:24.356 --> 01:28:26.824
What unites us?

01:28:30.329 --> 01:28:34.493
No buts, we win!

01:28:36.268 --> 01:28:39.465
We will bring the traitors to justice

01:28:44.743 --> 01:28:47.803
We will put all this in check

01:28:47.846 --> 01:28:51.009
And bury in the ground where it belongs

01:28:58.957 --> 01:29:01.084
Eureka!

01:29:48.807 --> 01:29:51.537
Eve! What happened? What happened? Isaac!

01:29:52.944 --> 01:29:55.640
Eve! Where Isaac and Emma?

01:29:56.848 --> 01:29:59.976
They took - what?!

01:30:01.453 --> 01:30:04.718
They know she resists

01:30:06.324 --> 01:30:08.884
how I can help?

01:30:08.927 --> 01:30:11.054
Let me help

01:30:11.096 --> 01:30:12.927
when I get

01:30:16.535 --> 01:30:19.936
thanks... all

01:30:24.242 --> 01:30:27.643
you say!
- Never Too Late

01:30:28.180 --> 01:30:31.081
to heal your heart

01:30:31.483 --> 01:30:34.145
Eve stay with me!

01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:37.720
Eve! Eve!

01:31:41.686 --> 01:31:45.452
My aggression was more
than a defect of monster

01:31:52.831 --> 01:31:55.629
This is a crucial survival tool

01:31:59.204 --> 01:32:01.399
unthinkable ago

01:33:06.705 --> 01:33:08.730
It sounds weird

01:33:10.275 --> 01:33:11.765
What we do?

01:33:22.120 --> 01:33:24.452
Give me time

01:33:25.156 --> 01:33:27.624
already come to me

01:34:24.816 --> 01:34:26.545
Doc?

01:34:27.919 --> 01:34:30.012
General wants to know how
much longer it will take

01:34:34.192 --> 01:34:38.026
Well... before I die

01:34:38.830 --> 01:34:41.230
I have only a little of your blood

01:34:47.172 --> 01:34:49.106
take time

01:36:54.399 --> 01:36:57.027
forgive

01:37:04.409 --> 01:37:06.741
Emma, ​​these right?

01:37:08.246 --> 01:37:09.736
Okay?

01:37:25.029 --> 01:37:27.293
Move!

01:37:30.935 --> 01:37:33.096
Go! go!

01:38:11.409 --> 01:38:13.775
Finish them!

01:38:15.914 --> 01:38:17.848
Isaac No, no!

01:38:17.882 --> 01:38:19.850
NO please do not!

01:38:19.884 --> 01:38:23.012
No! No!

01:38:35.333 --> 01:38:37.824
Go!

01:39:02.126 --> 01:39:03.821
Down!

01:39:13.504 --> 01:39:16.064
We must part

01:39:16.107 --> 01:39:18.200
I'll meet at the home of Eve
I have to finish this

01:39:18.242 --> 01:39:20.540
Please do not wait!
- Emma now!

01:40:21.906 --> 01:40:24.306
Here we go behind you kid!

01:40:56.741 --> 01:40:58.572
No!

01:41:04.282 --> 01:41:06.216
You ruined everything!

01:42:23.995 --> 01:42:25.929
I'm coming for you!

01:42:44.248 --> 01:42:46.307
Do not got it right, son!

01:42:48.085 --> 01:42:50.178
You should be on our side!

01:42:51.889 --> 01:42:54.153
That witch poisoned your mind!

01:42:54.659 --> 01:42:56.354
There are no sides!

01:42:56.394 --> 01:42:58.589
I never had

01:42:59.664 --> 01:43:04.067
You're just a desperate man
trying to find more fun

01:43:12.977 --> 01:43:15.673
What if we do this like gentlemen?

01:43:57.288 --> 01:44:00.815
He has the cure son

01:44:00.858 --> 01:44:02.826
Think what that means

01:44:05.630 --> 01:44:07.894
could restore order

01:44:08.466 --> 01:44:11.902
could claim back what we lost

01:44:13.704 --> 01:44:16.229
And we can recover Tennessee

01:44:17.575 --> 01:44:20.976
There is no cure for
behavior of a monster

01:44:22.813 --> 01:44:25.304
rather live among the undead

01:44:25.883 --> 01:44:28.113
I live with a man like your monster

01:46:16.293 --> 01:46:19.990
A broken heart can be a
new push to move forward

01:46:28.839 --> 01:46:32.639
We had to
and two empty life

01:46:43.387 --> 01:46:46.845
The story is a matter of survival

01:46:47.591 --> 01:46:52.221
light in the darkness,
existence with a broken heart

01:46:52.263 --> 01:46:54.595
nothing worthwhile to live

01:46:54.999 --> 01:46:58.230
Neither sunsets and sparkling waterfalls

01:46:59.103 --> 01:47:01.264
I say, there's the time

01:47:02.072 --> 01:47:07.135
But today... I see more clearly

01:47:07.545 --> 01:47:11.072
even in a world between the living dead

01:47:11.115 --> 01:47:16.519
If you choose hope... Anything is possible

01:47:22.726 --> 01:47:26.924
Emma's resistance to infection is
sufficient proof that the bloodline there

01:47:27.998 --> 01:47:31.456
What's an end to this problem

01:47:33.504 --> 01:47:38.464
end this diary as proof of these dark times

01:47:42.880 --> 01:47:45.872
= = It's never too late to heal
soul

01:47:47.785 --> 01:47:49.685
A friend told me that

01:48:07.438 --> 01:48:09.838
never stay away

01:48:10.441 --> 01:48:14.002
Be honest, be prepared

01:48:18.215 --> 01:48:20.615
And always fighting

01:48:21.185 --> 01:48:23.483
As you

01:48:33.063 --> 01:48:35.759
The output of humanity...

01:48:36.305 --> 01:48:42.834
