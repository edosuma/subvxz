WEBVTT

00:04.027 --> 00:05.978
Well, hello, Hank.
So good of you to come up.

00:05.986 --> 00:07.637
Well,
I'm not gonna miss

00:07.671 --> 00:10.489
the <i>America's Kidz</i>
<i>got singing</i> finale.

00:10.507 --> 00:12.959
Last time I was this excited
was this morning.

00:12.993 --> 00:16.045
I saw a cat wearing
the same sweater as its person.

00:18.131 --> 00:19.498
Jack, you remember
my granddaughter.

00:19.516 --> 00:21.250
Hi, Mr. Donaghy.

00:21.301 --> 00:22.502
Kaylie.

00:22.536 --> 00:24.220
There's Jenna Marone.

00:24.254 --> 00:28.558
So, Jack, how's your wife?
Still kidnapped?

00:28.592 --> 00:30.893
How's the yearbook going?
I heard you made editor...

00:30.928 --> 00:32.345
Of the photo captions.

00:32.378 --> 00:35.598
Pop-Pop, wait up.

00:35.649 --> 00:36.983
Pop-Pop, wait up.

00:37.017 --> 00:38.734
I'm so excited
for the finale.

00:38.769 --> 00:40.886
Not that it matters,
even if Brock doesn't win,

00:40.904 --> 00:42.572
he is going to get
a record contract.

00:42.606 --> 00:44.023
So, it definitely
doesn't matter.

00:44.057 --> 00:45.775
This isn't the last
we will be seeing of Brock.

00:45.826 --> 00:47.777
Well, whoever wins, it's
a great night for the industry.

00:47.828 --> 00:49.445
<i>Kidz</i> is a hit the whole family
can watch together,

00:49.496 --> 00:52.915
not your usual sitcom crap
full of gratuitous vulgarity

00:52.950 --> 00:53.950
and pratfalls.

00:55.385 --> 00:57.503
My penis!

00:57.538 --> 00:59.755
Jenna,
this is a big night.

00:59.790 --> 01:01.874
And I've got
something big planned.

01:01.908 --> 01:04.209
Tonight during
the finalists' duet,

01:04.244 --> 01:05.510
I'm gonna cry.

01:05.546 --> 01:08.080
Now, of course, none of these
little condom accidents

01:08.098 --> 01:10.766
could actually make me cry,
so I'm gonna rub this

01:10.801 --> 01:12.802
under my eyes
to help me fake it.

01:12.853 --> 01:14.086
It's an old acting trick
I learned

01:14.104 --> 01:15.638
from Glenn Beck's
prostitute.

01:15.689 --> 01:17.557
Well,
mark my words, Jenna,

01:17.591 --> 01:20.343
tonight is going to
be the greatest.

01:20.377 --> 01:22.562
Disaster
in the history of television.

01:22.596 --> 01:26.649
The young contestants apparently
inebriated on live TV.

01:29.319 --> 01:30.620
I gotta throw up.

01:32.406 --> 01:33.656
What happened?

01:33.707 --> 01:34.874
Why haven't you been
returning my calls?

01:34.908 --> 01:37.660
Because my phone
melted last night, Lemon.

01:37.711 --> 01:40.329
Come here, Jack.

01:42.382 --> 01:45.551
That was my angriest hug, 'cause
that's how I feel right now.

01:45.586 --> 01:47.803
Instead of heading
back to Philadelphia,

01:47.838 --> 01:50.339
I'm going down
to deal with the FCC.

01:50.390 --> 01:52.008
The <i>Federal
Clown Commission</i>.

01:52.059 --> 01:53.759
I hope that comes off
as respectful.

01:53.793 --> 01:54.844
My father was a clown,

01:54.895 --> 01:56.479
and I know how hard
those men work.

01:56.513 --> 01:57.930
I'm going to
get to the bottom

01:57.964 --> 01:59.432
of what happened
last night, sir.

01:59.466 --> 02:02.234
I've already detained Brock
and Ava under the patriot act.

02:02.269 --> 02:03.853
People have forgotten
about that thing,

02:03.904 --> 02:07.573
but any white male
can arrest any other person.

02:07.608 --> 02:10.443
Hello, peers.

02:10.477 --> 02:12.078
Sure has been
a busy morning

02:12.112 --> 02:13.696
down in
the Standards department.

02:13.747 --> 02:15.581
Because of last night's
cluster-whoops,

02:15.616 --> 02:16.949
Darren was fired.

02:16.983 --> 02:19.001
Then he threatened
to come back with a gun.

02:19.036 --> 02:20.870
Then I got a promotion,

02:20.921 --> 02:23.673
and the desk
closest to the door.

02:23.707 --> 02:28.044
Here are my new
business cards.

02:28.095 --> 02:31.180
Late night programming?
So you're covering <i>TGS</i> now?

02:31.214 --> 02:33.649
And a wonderful
new show from D.L. Hughley

02:33.684 --> 02:36.552
that's already
been canceled!

02:36.603 --> 02:38.604
I feel like
Oscar the grouch today,

02:38.639 --> 02:40.106
and not just
'cause I woke up

02:40.140 --> 02:41.557
in a garbage can
this morning,

02:41.608 --> 02:43.526
startling someone
named Gordon.

02:43.560 --> 02:44.977
What's wrong, Tracy?

02:45.011 --> 02:46.062
I can't eat
for 24 hours

02:46.113 --> 02:47.229
'cause I have
a colonoscopy tomorrow.

02:47.280 --> 02:48.531
I'm starving!

02:48.565 --> 02:51.067
You know, fasting
can actually clear your mind.

02:51.118 --> 02:53.035
In college, I once
went on a hunger strike

02:53.070 --> 02:54.704
to protest apartheid...

02:54.738 --> 02:58.958
You're the one who solved that?
Thank you so much.

02:58.992 --> 03:02.828
1997 Heather Locklear,
what are you doing here?

03:02.862 --> 03:03.963
What? Jenna!

03:03.997 --> 03:05.581
Save it, Liz.

03:05.632 --> 03:08.801
Yes, I was disappointed that
I didn't get to do my fake cry,

03:08.835 --> 03:10.586
but I do have a plan B.

03:10.637 --> 03:13.255
The whole point of the cry
was to humanize me,

03:13.306 --> 03:14.807
to change
public perception,

03:14.841 --> 03:18.010
but what else
humanizes a monster?

03:18.044 --> 03:19.011
Motherhood.

03:19.045 --> 03:20.312
God. Don't adopt.

03:20.347 --> 03:21.931
That child
is better off in Somalia.

03:21.982 --> 03:24.734
It could be a pirate,
or a warlord's concubine.

03:24.768 --> 03:26.218
This is better
than adopting.

03:26.236 --> 03:28.938
Remember my little moneymaking
scheme back in Chicago?

03:28.989 --> 03:30.823
Cashing your dead aunt's
social security checks?

03:30.857 --> 03:32.408
No,
I'm still doing that.

03:32.442 --> 03:34.410
I'm talking about
when I donated my eggs.

03:34.444 --> 03:36.445
So, a couple of months ago,
I called

03:36.496 --> 03:39.115
the calumet city egg donation
center and house of blues

03:39.166 --> 03:41.117
to see if there were
any little Jennas out there

03:41.168 --> 03:42.334
who wanted to meet me.

03:42.369 --> 03:44.453
Hang on, are you saying
you have a kid?

03:44.504 --> 03:46.338
No, I don't.

03:48.008 --> 03:50.376
I have six kids.

03:50.410 --> 03:52.545
Jerome, share the bronzer,
you slut.

03:53.714 --> 03:55.214
Dear God.

03:57.000 --> 04:03.074

30 ROCK
S06 Ep 11 - Standards and Practices

04:10.485 --> 04:13.585
Sync and corrected by dr.jackson
for www.addic7ed.com

04:13.650 --> 04:16.035
I'm a very
powerful man, Brock.

04:16.069 --> 04:17.737
Little league tryouts
are coming soon.

04:17.771 --> 04:19.872
How would you like
to wind up on a team with...

04:19.906 --> 04:22.324
None of your friends?

04:22.375 --> 04:24.660
It was her idea!
She made me do it!

04:24.711 --> 04:26.996
Brock just
sold you out, Ava.

04:30.950 --> 04:32.368
What are you
doing to Molly?

04:32.402 --> 04:34.804
She already had to
live through world war ii.

04:34.838 --> 04:36.338
Brock said it was
all your idea.

04:36.389 --> 04:38.307
No, it was her idea.

04:38.341 --> 04:39.508
She's just so cool.

04:39.559 --> 04:41.143
Like a human silly band!

04:41.178 --> 04:43.429
Who?
Who's a human silly band?

04:43.463 --> 04:44.680
I'm tall enough now

04:44.731 --> 04:45.981
that there isn't
a roller coaster in the world

04:46.016 --> 04:46.982
I can't go on.

04:47.017 --> 04:48.400
So...

04:48.435 --> 04:51.103
You guys drink beer.

04:51.137 --> 04:54.340
Or are you babies?

04:54.374 --> 04:56.358
Jack versus Kaylie,
round two,

04:56.409 --> 04:58.160
colon...

04:58.195 --> 05:00.162
No subtitle necessary.

05:00.197 --> 05:02.915
Mommy announcement.

05:02.949 --> 05:04.283
I hope we're all waxed,

05:04.317 --> 05:05.751
because you're coming with me
to my interview tonight

05:05.786 --> 05:09.421
for Barbara Walters'
<i>10 most overexposed people.</i>

05:09.456 --> 05:12.508
Barbara Walters!

05:12.542 --> 05:14.794
Okay, so, let me just quickly
identify everyone's good sides.

05:14.828 --> 05:16.712
Left, left, right,

05:16.763 --> 05:19.682
right, left...

05:19.716 --> 05:22.384
Judy. That's not really
on message.

05:22.435 --> 05:23.669
Look, I didn't
call the donation center

05:23.687 --> 05:24.970
to be on TV, Jenna.

05:25.004 --> 05:28.524
I wanted to go get a cup
of coffee and get to know you.

05:28.558 --> 05:29.725
If you want
to get to know me,

05:29.776 --> 05:32.862
read my 2006 interview
in <i>AmTrak magazine.</i>

05:32.896 --> 05:36.065
If you want to be my daughter,
put on this wig and smile.

05:36.116 --> 05:39.819
There you are, liierz.

05:39.853 --> 05:42.454
Boy, I am still not comfortable
calling you by your first name.

05:42.489 --> 05:44.073
Then again,
you've never been comfortable

05:44.124 --> 05:45.708
calling me by my
full Christian name.

05:45.742 --> 05:47.159
Kenneth.

05:47.193 --> 05:50.663
No, "Kenneth" is short
for andromakennethamblesorton.

05:50.697 --> 05:53.999
So, what's up?...

05:54.033 --> 05:55.134
Wait, what is this?

05:55.168 --> 05:57.253
"Additional restrictions
to broadcast standards"?

05:57.304 --> 05:58.554
Yes.

05:58.588 --> 06:00.806
People are pretty upset
about last night.

06:00.841 --> 06:03.092
How can we do "Fart doctor"
without the word "fart"?

06:03.143 --> 06:06.243
I'm surprised
they allow you to say "doctor."

06:06.442 --> 06:09.142
It's so close to "gynecologist"
which is disgusting.

06:12.904 --> 06:14.904
Have you seen this memo
from Standards?

06:14.984 --> 06:17.784
Kenneth is being a real...
dingbat,

06:17.869 --> 06:19.870
which is now the harshest word
we are allowed to say.

06:19.921 --> 06:21.672
You can blame that
on Kaylie Hooper.

06:21.706 --> 06:23.173
She's the one
who ruined the <i>Kidz</i> finale.

06:23.208 --> 06:26.293
Really? What a... dingbat.

06:26.327 --> 06:27.928
Why didn't
I see this coming?

06:27.963 --> 06:30.681
I knew this company
was making me lose my edge.

06:30.715 --> 06:33.767
That's why I hired a Cato
to attack me at random.

06:33.802 --> 06:35.886
Like inspector clouseau.

06:35.921 --> 06:39.106
Cato?

06:39.140 --> 06:41.191
Don't attack me
tonight, okay?

06:41.226 --> 06:43.444
I know I told you that
when I say, "don't attack me,"

06:43.478 --> 06:44.812
that's when I most
need you to attack me,

06:44.846 --> 06:47.765
but I'm serious.

06:47.799 --> 06:50.718
Cato?

06:51.786 --> 06:53.871
Excellent, Cato,
excellent!

06:53.905 --> 06:56.407
Did Kaylie really think
I wouldn't figure this out?

06:56.458 --> 06:58.459
No, she knew I would.

06:58.493 --> 06:59.460
So, she's going to
be ready for me.

06:59.494 --> 07:01.245
Good.
I like a fair fight.

07:01.296 --> 07:03.964
Okay, she is
just a teenage girl.

07:03.999 --> 07:07.334
Lemon, you know very well
that a Nemesis can be anyone...

07:07.368 --> 07:08.719
Or anything.

07:10.088 --> 07:11.505
Autocorrect.

07:11.539 --> 07:13.490
I was trying to say
"pen organizer."

07:16.323 --> 07:18.423
God!
You're a winter!

07:18.732 --> 07:20.833
I don't know
what that means.

07:20.867 --> 07:23.753
Why are there only six chairs
out there? There's seven of us.

07:23.787 --> 07:27.673
No. One of us will
have to sit out the interview.

07:27.708 --> 07:30.176
I'm just gonna choose at random
who it's gonna be.

07:30.210 --> 07:35.147
Eenie-meenie-miney-moe,
out goes ♪ y-o-u

07:35.182 --> 07:36.933
- I'm sorry, Judy.
- Bye, Judy.

07:38.602 --> 07:40.886
Could've just gotten
another chair.

07:42.723 --> 07:43.673
Who is it?

07:43.707 --> 07:45.524
Sweetie, it's Pop-Pop.

07:45.559 --> 07:48.811
I came back from D.C. early,
and I lost my darn key.

07:48.862 --> 07:52.048
What a world.

07:52.082 --> 07:54.116
Surprise.

07:54.151 --> 07:57.570
I'm very good at voices, Kaylie.

07:57.604 --> 07:59.789
I'm very good.

07:59.823 --> 08:01.374
I know what you did.

08:01.408 --> 08:03.776
And you had to assume
I'd break Brock and Ava,

08:03.794 --> 08:04.994
so, you're ready for this,

08:05.045 --> 08:06.495
but here's what
you weren't counting on...

08:06.546 --> 08:07.964
This has nothing
to do with you!

08:07.998 --> 08:09.465
I just had to get
Pop-Pop out of town

08:09.499 --> 08:11.183
because I am
in so much trouble!

08:11.218 --> 08:13.219
Henry and his friends had to go
to the King of Prussia mall

08:13.253 --> 08:14.754
last Thursday night
'cause it was a half day,

08:14.788 --> 08:16.455
and I couldn't go
'cause I had piano,

08:16.473 --> 08:17.623
and my friend Vickie,
well,

08:17.641 --> 08:19.392
she said she got grounded
'cause she went

08:19.426 --> 08:20.843
to some highlighter party
with Dylan

08:20.894 --> 08:22.294
while his parents
were out of town.

08:22.312 --> 08:24.180
Okay, hang on.
Calm down.

08:24.231 --> 08:26.315
And then fat Vickie
saw her there,

08:26.350 --> 08:28.734
so I called her,
and Henry answered her phone

08:28.769 --> 08:30.269
because he had
Vickie's phone!

08:30.303 --> 08:31.470
Wait, which Vickie?
Fat Vickie?

08:31.488 --> 08:32.471
Vickie P.
Are you even listening to me?

08:32.489 --> 08:34.807
- Okay.
- God!

08:34.825 --> 08:36.241
Vickie used to be
my best friend.

08:36.275 --> 08:38.995
I had her youface password,
so I logged onto her account,

08:39.029 --> 08:40.279
and posted
all these photos

08:40.313 --> 08:41.496
with "I am a slut"
written on her forehead,

08:41.530 --> 08:43.432
and then school found out,
so now my life is over!

08:43.467 --> 08:44.917
Please!

08:44.951 --> 08:46.985
What does this have to do
with sabotaging me?

08:47.004 --> 08:48.587
This has nothing
to do with you!

08:48.622 --> 08:49.955
I messed up the show
to make sure

08:49.989 --> 08:51.657
Pop-Pop wouldn't come back
to Philadelphia with me,

08:51.675 --> 08:53.342
'cause Dr. Melvoin is trying
to kick me out of school,

08:53.377 --> 08:55.177
and if Pop-Pop comes
to the teacher conference,

08:55.212 --> 08:56.796
well, then,
he'll let them expel me,

08:56.830 --> 08:59.832
and I'll have to go to some
school in the middle of nowhere,

08:59.850 --> 09:02.835
and then I might as well
be dead!

09:02.853 --> 09:04.503
Wait, where are
your parents?

09:04.521 --> 09:06.171
Who knows?

09:06.189 --> 09:08.891
My mom is in Indonesia
visiting her charity

09:08.942 --> 09:11.310
where poor children
make shoes.

09:11.344 --> 09:12.311
Isn't that
just a sweat shop?

09:12.345 --> 09:14.146
I know!

09:14.180 --> 09:16.032
And then my dad put
a Porsche engine in a model T

09:16.066 --> 09:17.850
and drove it to Mardi Gras!

09:17.868 --> 09:20.569
I know what it's like
not to have your parents around.

09:20.620 --> 09:23.188
I once took
a log with googly eyes

09:23.206 --> 09:25.157
to a father-son picnic.

09:25.191 --> 09:27.359
But, uh,
who's going to take you

09:27.377 --> 09:29.194
to this parent-teacher
conference?

09:29.212 --> 09:30.713
I don't know.

09:30.747 --> 09:32.698
I have nobody!

09:32.716 --> 09:34.467
I wanna die!

09:37.671 --> 09:40.589
Do you have a second,
Kenneth?

09:40.640 --> 09:42.758
No, there's only one of me.
What? What are you asking?

09:42.809 --> 09:43.876
Look, we have
a show tonight.

09:43.894 --> 09:46.011
You can't just take away
all these words

09:46.045 --> 09:47.680
we've been using
for the past six years.

09:47.714 --> 09:49.014
That reminds me.

09:49.048 --> 09:51.817
You can't say "using" on TV.
It implies drug use.

09:51.852 --> 09:55.122
We're saying
whatever we want.

09:56.857 --> 09:59.057
No, you can't.

09:59.076 --> 10:00.726
That's an order.

10:00.744 --> 10:02.394
I stole that speech
from an episode <i>JAG,</i>

10:02.412 --> 10:03.395
but it applies here.

10:03.413 --> 10:04.897
Are you kidding me?

10:04.915 --> 10:06.115
Last week you were a page,

10:06.166 --> 10:07.366
now you're telling me
how to run my show?

10:07.400 --> 10:09.568
Well, I am arguing
back at you.

10:09.586 --> 10:11.670
I have enough crap to deal
with around here, Kenneth...

10:11.705 --> 10:14.123
I'm interrupting you
'cause I'm good at arguing!

10:14.174 --> 10:15.791
I don't need you
to make my life worse.

10:15.842 --> 10:18.561
I am responding,
I am matching your tone,

10:18.595 --> 10:20.012
and making my own point.

10:20.046 --> 10:23.248
You know what, Kenneth?
Fine. You win.

10:23.266 --> 10:27.269
But as we saw
the other night on <i>Kidz,</i>

10:27.304 --> 10:30.389
anything can happen
on live TV.

10:30.423 --> 10:32.090
- Right, Tracy?
- What?

10:32.109 --> 10:33.726
I'm just saying, Tray,

10:33.760 --> 10:35.444
you're very unpredictable.

10:35.479 --> 10:37.313
And we'll write
clean sketches,

10:37.364 --> 10:39.198
but you might
just do your stand-up act.

10:39.232 --> 10:40.933
- Who knows?
- Okay.

10:40.951 --> 10:43.869
I'm still fasting
because I misread my calendar.

10:43.904 --> 10:45.988
Tomorrow
is my colonoscopy.

10:46.039 --> 10:48.607
Today was my meeting
with Colin o'Scopy.

10:48.625 --> 10:50.376
Therefore, I have no idea

10:50.410 --> 10:54.580
what you're saying,
talking Turkey leg.

11:07.511 --> 11:09.895
Were you
a difficult teenager?

11:09.930 --> 11:14.483
Well, I was voted
head of the PTA, so no.

11:14.518 --> 11:16.685
I'm accustomed to dealing
with difficult people, Lemon,

11:16.736 --> 11:19.855
but teenage girls, ugh...

11:19.906 --> 11:21.106
Are a puzzle.

11:21.140 --> 11:24.360
Yes, how was your meeting
with your Nemesis?

11:24.411 --> 11:26.529
I volunteered
to accompany Kaylie

11:26.580 --> 11:28.414
to a parent-teacher conference
at her school.

11:28.448 --> 11:30.366
- What? Why?
- It's complicated.

11:30.417 --> 11:32.117
The point is, and I never
thought I'd say this,

11:32.151 --> 11:35.087
I actually feel badly
for Kaylie.

11:35.121 --> 11:36.705
On the other hand,
I know full well

11:36.756 --> 11:38.624
that this is
an opportunity to destroy her.

11:38.658 --> 11:39.925
I could get her expelled,

11:39.960 --> 11:41.927
sent off to some
second-rate boarding school,

11:41.962 --> 11:45.347
then on to that last bastion
of the incompetent rich,

11:45.382 --> 11:46.715
USC.

11:46.766 --> 11:48.934
I don't know, Jack,
you should stay out of this.

11:48.969 --> 11:50.102
No, I could
help this girl.

11:50.136 --> 11:52.521
Or destroy this monster.

11:52.556 --> 11:55.024
If I could just tell whether
she's vicious or vulnerable.

11:55.058 --> 11:56.942
That's the problem.
She's a teenage girl.

11:56.977 --> 11:58.727
She's vicious
and vulnerable.

11:58.778 --> 12:00.279
She might be
completely lying,

12:00.313 --> 12:02.731
like when I was 15
and told everyone at my school

12:02.782 --> 12:04.116
that I'd already
gotten my period,

12:04.150 --> 12:06.402
or she could be
in real trouble,

12:06.453 --> 12:08.871
like when I was 17,
and finally got my period

12:08.905 --> 12:12.858
at a very loosely supervised
petting zoo.

12:12.876 --> 12:14.243
Once again, Lemon,
I leave your office

12:14.294 --> 12:15.911
more confused
than when I entered,

12:15.962 --> 12:19.215
but having glimpsed yet another
tile in the rich mosaic

12:19.249 --> 12:24.169
that is your
menstrual history.

12:24.203 --> 12:26.639
So bravo wants to do
a reality show about us,

12:26.673 --> 12:28.206
and I thought
the opening credits

12:28.225 --> 12:30.142
could be all of us
in a giant dog bed,

12:30.176 --> 12:31.310
and you guys are suckling

12:31.344 --> 12:34.096
on prosthetic dog teats
that I'm wearing.

12:34.147 --> 12:36.232
Actually,
we had a different idea.

12:36.266 --> 12:37.650
Now that Judy's gone,

12:37.684 --> 12:39.768
it's kind of obvious
someone is the odd person out.

12:39.819 --> 12:41.103
It's Jerome, right?

12:41.154 --> 12:42.404
I didn't want
to say anything

12:42.439 --> 12:43.606
'cause I was trying
to be a good mother,

12:43.657 --> 12:45.324
but you're cheesy,
and everyone hates you.

12:45.358 --> 12:46.909
No, Jenna, you.

12:46.943 --> 12:49.028
You're so much older
than the rest of us,

12:49.062 --> 12:50.412
so we're thinking
the show is more like

12:50.447 --> 12:51.747
<i>The girls next door,</i>

12:51.781 --> 12:54.700
and you're that old boat captain
that shows up sometimes.

12:54.734 --> 12:56.368
That's Hugh Hefner,
Jessica.

12:56.402 --> 12:58.520
Yeah, we have no idea
who that is,

12:58.555 --> 13:00.256
so you're kind of
just proving our point.

13:00.290 --> 13:04.126
I see.

13:04.177 --> 13:08.130
Very well.

13:12.886 --> 13:17.222
Looking for this?

13:17.256 --> 13:19.558
Well played.

13:39.379 --> 13:41.380
Dude, what's up?

13:41.414 --> 13:44.750
I'm just having
a bad day, sir.

13:44.784 --> 13:49.388
All right, bro-bro,
let's just be cool,

13:49.422 --> 13:52.925
and sit down and pee in silence,
like dudes do.

13:52.959 --> 13:55.627
It's just...
I started a new job,

13:55.645 --> 13:57.796
and it's stressful enough

13:57.814 --> 14:01.150
just having my own wastebasket
that I have to fill every day

14:01.184 --> 14:03.301
without Liz Lemon
yelling at me,

14:03.320 --> 14:06.238
and I just wish
I had never been born!

14:07.607 --> 14:10.142
'Cause if I can't even
get my friend Liz...

14:10.160 --> 14:12.277
At least I thought
she was my friend...

14:12.311 --> 14:13.912
To respect me,
how will I ever run a network

14:13.947 --> 14:17.950
and boss around
those Jewish executives

14:17.984 --> 14:20.652
that were trained
from birth to argue?

14:20.670 --> 14:22.705
So, I should just
give Liz what she wants,

14:22.756 --> 14:23.956
and quit.

14:23.990 --> 14:25.657
Bro...

14:25.675 --> 14:29.327
You should just smack
that Liz in the mouth.

14:29.346 --> 14:31.113
Sorry I babbled
so much.

14:31.147 --> 14:32.598
Thanks for listening.

14:32.632 --> 14:34.600
I'm Kenneth, by the way.

14:34.634 --> 14:36.835
Me too. I'm Kenneth.

14:36.853 --> 14:39.171
Kenneth... uh...

14:39.189 --> 14:41.523
Toilethole.

14:44.389 --> 14:46.489
I'm so sorry Dr. Melvoin.

14:46.510 --> 14:49.345
You know, I already apologized
to Vickie, and to fat Vickie.

14:49.379 --> 14:51.463
Fat Vickie's parents
were very upset

14:51.482 --> 14:52.982
that she was dragged
into this mess.

14:53.017 --> 14:55.318
I know.
I know what I did was stupid,

14:55.352 --> 14:57.320
and I've really learned
my lesson.

14:57.354 --> 15:00.056
Look, if I could
go back in time,

15:00.074 --> 15:01.991
I'd just...
I'd skip clarinet,

15:02.026 --> 15:03.893
and I'd go to the spring
football with my friends,

15:03.911 --> 15:06.112
and none of this
ever would've happened.

15:06.163 --> 15:08.498
Or you simply could have
not posted those pictures.

15:08.532 --> 15:10.066
On hot Vickie's
youface page, miss Hooper.

15:10.084 --> 15:11.534
Hold on, Melvoin.

15:11.568 --> 15:13.369
You told me
it was the piano,

15:13.403 --> 15:15.872
and that everyone went
to the King of Prussia mall.

15:15.906 --> 15:19.676
Well...

15:19.710 --> 15:22.011
I don't remember.

15:22.046 --> 15:24.464
And I'm just
so emotional right now.

15:32.439 --> 15:33.973
I'm sorry, how are you
related to miss Hooper?

15:34.024 --> 15:36.092
I'm her Nemesis.

15:36.110 --> 15:37.360
You bastard.

15:37.394 --> 15:39.529
Don't do this, Donaghy.

15:39.563 --> 15:40.780
I think that this school

15:40.815 --> 15:42.565
has done everything it can
for Kaylie,

15:42.599 --> 15:46.286
but the only fitting
punishment...

15:46.320 --> 15:47.704
Is expulsion.

15:47.738 --> 15:50.156
It's days like this
that remind me

15:50.207 --> 15:52.492
why I got into teaching
in the first place.

15:57.214 --> 15:59.132
Kenneth,
we need to talk.

15:59.166 --> 16:00.834
I don't know,
'cause someone

16:00.885 --> 16:02.302
who actually cares
about my feelings

16:02.336 --> 16:03.887
told me to smack you
in the mouth.

16:03.921 --> 16:06.339
No, don't listen
to Kenneth Toilethole.

16:06.390 --> 16:08.675
- You know him?
- Yeah. He's great.

16:08.726 --> 16:11.511
We should all go
get dinner sometime.

16:11.562 --> 16:13.680
Kenneth,
you can do this job,

16:13.731 --> 16:16.099
and I do respect you.

16:16.133 --> 16:17.734
Then wash my feet
with your hair.

16:17.768 --> 16:20.186
No! But I did completely
rewrite the show.

16:20.237 --> 16:23.573
We're not even using
the word "dingbat," Mr. Parcell.

16:23.607 --> 16:26.309
A Parcell man
has never been called "mister"

16:26.327 --> 16:28.411
outside of
an execution chamber.

16:28.445 --> 16:30.246
Boy.

16:34.285 --> 16:36.536
The blonde ones,
they turned on me.

16:36.587 --> 16:39.205
They threw me away like
I was some kind of Judy.

16:39.256 --> 16:41.591
Oh, God.
Is this how Judy felt?

16:41.625 --> 16:43.459
Judy was nice and sweet

16:43.493 --> 16:45.995
and wanted to get
a coffee enema or something,

16:46.013 --> 16:48.097
and I treated her
like garbage.

16:48.132 --> 16:49.849
Well, then why don't you
apologize to her?

16:49.884 --> 16:51.050
She's right behind you.

16:52.803 --> 16:57.056
Judy,
you're so beautiful now!

16:59.610 --> 17:02.028
I just came to say good-bye
before I head home.

17:02.062 --> 17:03.730
I wish we had spent
more time together,

17:03.781 --> 17:05.781
but I guess I'll see you
on TV.

17:05.816 --> 17:07.183
No.
Of all my children,

17:07.201 --> 17:08.184
you're the only one
that proves

17:08.202 --> 17:09.652
there's any good in me.

17:09.685 --> 17:10.737
Forget TV.

17:10.788 --> 17:12.704
Let's go get
that coffee now.

17:12.740 --> 17:15.074
No. You know
you can't do that.

17:15.125 --> 17:17.827
<i>One minute to air.
One minute.</i>

17:17.861 --> 17:19.494
I have to stop Jenna
from leaving. You just...

17:19.529 --> 17:20.747
No problem.
I'll cover.

17:20.798 --> 17:21.998
Day two of my fast,
and you were right.

17:22.031 --> 17:24.500
My mind is clear,
and I'm sharp as a tack.

17:24.534 --> 17:25.667
Great, Tray, thanks.

17:25.702 --> 17:26.970
My brain is working
overtime.

17:27.003 --> 17:29.222
I finally understand the ending
of <i>The sixth sense.</i>

17:29.256 --> 17:31.591
Those names are the people
who worked on the movie.

17:31.642 --> 17:32.892
Yeah, and I just got

17:32.927 --> 17:34.510
what you were trying
to tell me yesterday.

17:34.544 --> 17:36.512
You want me to do
my filthy stand-up act

17:36.546 --> 17:39.182
instead of reading
the cue cards.

17:39.216 --> 17:40.216
No.

17:42.403 --> 17:43.653
Jack! Help!

17:43.687 --> 17:45.939
I was right about Kaylie,
and I crushed her.

17:45.990 --> 17:47.106
That's great.
I need...

17:47.157 --> 17:48.391
The whole time,
she was playing me,

17:48.409 --> 17:50.076
but in the end, she made
the biggest mistake.

17:50.110 --> 17:51.494
She could not have been worse
in that meeting

17:51.528 --> 17:54.747
than if she had
wanted me to...

17:54.782 --> 17:56.332
Son of a dingbat!

17:58.786 --> 18:00.403
Tracy's gonna do
his stand-up act on the show!

18:00.421 --> 18:03.172
What are we gonna do?

18:03.207 --> 18:06.075
I'm gonna live bleep him.

18:06.093 --> 18:10.179
Normally, I'd have to get
permission from Irene first,

18:10.214 --> 18:12.382
but there isn't time.

18:23.610 --> 18:25.812
You know why I love
Dominican women?

18:25.863 --> 18:28.498
'Cause they love to
those big

18:28.532 --> 18:30.650
'Cause they eat all our
aloud.

18:30.701 --> 18:33.236
I'd like to introduce
housed in a

18:33.270 --> 18:35.154
[Bleep], booooy!

18:35.205 --> 18:38.074
You just ate a
with extra?

18:38.108 --> 18:39.575
Well, you called
the right.

18:39.609 --> 18:41.127
That's our show
for tonight!

18:41.161 --> 18:44.330
See you next week!

18:44.381 --> 18:47.166
- That was amazing!
- It sure was.

18:47.217 --> 18:49.335
Kenneth,
I'm Gaylord Felcher.

18:49.386 --> 18:50.720
The head of Standards?

18:50.754 --> 18:52.638
I have never seen
bleeping like that,

18:52.673 --> 18:53.956
so guess what?

18:53.974 --> 18:55.725
I'm promoting you,
you little -face.

18:55.759 --> 18:58.094
All right, Felcher, you don't
have to talk like that.

18:58.112 --> 18:59.479
Well, who's gonna stop me?

18:59.513 --> 19:03.166
Who among you has the power
to censor the censor?

19:09.439 --> 19:11.741
What a surprise.

19:11.775 --> 19:14.443
Whatever are you doing here,
Kaylie Hooper?

19:14.461 --> 19:17.413
Enjoying my total lack
of adult supervision.

19:17.447 --> 19:20.083
I just had fruit roll-ups
for dinner...

19:20.117 --> 19:23.086
At a strip club.

19:24.471 --> 19:27.256
Do you wanted to get expelled
from school, didn't you?

19:27.290 --> 19:29.509
Look who figured it out.

19:29.560 --> 19:31.344
It only took you,
oh, I don't know,

19:31.395 --> 19:32.962
a million hours.

19:32.980 --> 19:35.982
You didn't lie to me
about getting sent to school

19:36.016 --> 19:37.183
in the "Middle of nowhere."

19:37.234 --> 19:38.801
What I realized too late is,

19:38.819 --> 19:41.187
you were talking
about Beekman Academy,

19:41.238 --> 19:42.355
right here in Manhattan,

19:42.406 --> 19:44.107
in the neighborhood
North of ware street,

19:44.141 --> 19:46.909
otherwise known as,
uh, "noware."

19:46.944 --> 19:49.812
Now I'll be able to be close
to my boyfriend Henry.

19:49.830 --> 19:52.148
Like hot Vickie could
ever steal him from me.

19:52.166 --> 19:55.585
He's going to NYU.
To study acting.

19:56.653 --> 19:57.920
If Pop-Pop had gone
to that meeting,

19:57.955 --> 19:58.921
he would have just
written a check

19:58.956 --> 20:00.489
and made it all go away.

20:00.507 --> 20:03.376
You needed somebody
to throw you under the bus.

20:03.427 --> 20:04.994
You needed a patsy.

20:07.931 --> 20:09.682
I, uh, couldn't
help but notice

20:09.716 --> 20:12.685
that lacrosse ball
in your backpack.

20:12.719 --> 20:14.854
Too bad I'm on the board of
the Central Park conservancy,

20:14.888 --> 20:18.107
so beekman won't have a field
to play on next year.

20:18.142 --> 20:21.077
Well, good, 'cause I planted
that lacrosse ball there

20:21.111 --> 20:23.980
to get back at a girl I hate
who plays lacrosse.

20:24.014 --> 20:25.982
Her name is Jack... ie.

20:26.016 --> 20:28.985
Jackie... officecouch.

20:29.019 --> 20:30.686
Damn you, Donaghy!

20:35.358 --> 20:36.909
Cato? Seriously,
not tonight.

20:36.960 --> 20:37.910
I mean it this time.

20:39.480 --> 20:41.030
Son of a dingbat!

20:43.718 --> 20:46.304
Sorry.
That phone call took forever.

20:46.338 --> 20:47.488
Where's Kenneth Toilethole?

20:47.522 --> 20:48.990
You just missed him.

20:49.024 --> 20:50.024
Again.

20:50.058 --> 20:52.443
He had to go
to the bathroom.

20:52.494 --> 20:54.078
You know what?
I'll go get him.

20:54.112 --> 20:55.496
No, don't!

20:55.530 --> 20:59.116
Every time one of you leaves,
the other one comes back.

20:59.167 --> 21:02.169
You know,
I'm starting to suspect

21:02.204 --> 21:04.955
that I have bad luck.

21:06.433 --> 21:08.315
Dude, bro, where's Liz?

21:08.375 --> 21:11.164
You didn't see her?
She just left.

21:11.165 --> 21:13.265
I gotta go feed the meter.

21:15.502 --> 21:19.002
