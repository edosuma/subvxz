01:58.498 --> 02:00.398
Mom? Knock, knock.

02:01.235 --> 02:05.729
It is too early for "Knock, knock."
Come on, eat up. We're running late.

02:12.246 --> 02:13.577
Chris, give me a break!

02:13.647 --> 02:15.581
Must it be World War II this morning?

02:16.083 --> 02:17.914
World War III.

02:18.352 --> 02:19.683
Cute, kid.

02:22.723 --> 02:24.315
8:30, Cal!

02:25.892 --> 02:28.292
- Why didn't you tell me it was so late?
- I just did.

02:28.362 --> 02:29.386
- Dad?
- What?

02:29.463 --> 02:30.589
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

02:30.664 --> 02:31.824
- Dwayne.
- Dwayne who?

02:31.932 --> 02:33.729
Dwayne the bathtub, I'm dwowning!

02:33.800 --> 02:35.631
That's terrible!

02:37.004 --> 02:38.835
That's not my lunch, is it?

02:39.439 --> 02:41.430
Not now, it isn't.

02:41.742 --> 02:45.872
- When did your friends leave this morning?
- I thought they were your friends.

02:46.313 --> 02:47.905
They left about 3:00.

02:48.448 --> 02:50.211
You used to be able to go all night.

02:50.450 --> 02:52.441
I know, but I can't do it anymore.

02:52.719 --> 02:54.152
What can't you do anymore?

02:54.621 --> 02:56.213
Eat your breakfast.

02:56.290 --> 02:59.953
Do you think I should have served
the last drink in my pajamas?

03:00.294 --> 03:02.319
Shoes and socks on. Let's go.

03:02.963 --> 03:04.362
Oh, shit.

03:04.865 --> 03:05.889
Great.

03:06.500 --> 03:08.024
- Terrific, Cal.
- I got it.

03:08.735 --> 03:10.726
Not the socks!

03:14.908 --> 03:17.069
- Hit the showers.
- Right.

03:26.720 --> 03:27.709
Mom?

03:28.288 --> 03:29.550
What?

03:29.690 --> 03:31.351
Coffee machine.

03:31.658 --> 03:33.319
Perfect!

03:41.268 --> 03:42.360
Mom.

03:52.579 --> 03:54.979
What is it? Jesus!

03:55.048 --> 03:57.107
Lisa, no! Oh, my God, no!

03:57.184 --> 03:58.811
Chris, don't touch her!

04:00.153 --> 04:01.711
Jesus Christ!

04:05.192 --> 04:07.683
My God! Christ!

06:51.758 --> 06:53.919
<i>Por favor, don't break nothing!</i>

06:54.294 --> 06:58.196
And be careful from the walls.
Mrs. Halliday just painted them.

06:58.565 --> 07:00.328
Follow me, okay?

07:05.972 --> 07:08.031
You did what anyone would have done.

07:08.875 --> 07:11.207
It happened so fast. I just reacted.

07:11.545 --> 07:15.879
He was trying to help.
Christ, the man's got four kids!

07:16.149 --> 07:17.639
You'll be more effective...

07:17.884 --> 07:21.320
...when you do go back out there,
if you begin to forgive yourself.

07:21.655 --> 07:25.751
That's what this is all about, Frank.
That's how I can help you, if you'll let me.

07:27.227 --> 07:28.888
I want to.

07:29.229 --> 07:30.890
I do. It's...

07:32.132 --> 07:33.121
Good.

07:34.901 --> 07:37.802
I'd say we made a pretty good beginning,
wouldn't you?

07:38.872 --> 07:40.635
I'll set you up for next week, then.

07:45.912 --> 07:48.403
What have you got there, little guy?

07:48.582 --> 07:50.243
Chief Black Cloud.

07:52.752 --> 07:53.912
Are you sick?

07:55.922 --> 07:57.253
I'm sorry.

07:57.591 --> 08:00.082
- You can call me anytime.
- Right.

08:00.594 --> 08:02.186
See you next Thursday.

08:02.262 --> 08:05.754
Hopefully we'll be
a little better settled in by then.

08:05.832 --> 08:07.766
- Thank you, Doctor.
- You're welcome.

08:11.471 --> 08:13.063
Are you all right, Bean?

08:19.879 --> 08:21.540
Not so fast, my friend.

08:23.216 --> 08:27.380
From now on, I don't think
you should play in here while I'm working.

08:27.721 --> 08:29.211
Is it a deal?

08:31.992 --> 08:34.392
Okay. What do we got here?

08:34.660 --> 08:38.563
Flowers. Mrs. Ruiz and I
are gonna plant some for Mom.

08:38.898 --> 08:40.229
Like these?

08:45.905 --> 08:47.429
Mom wants me to.

08:48.074 --> 08:49.666
Do you believe me?

08:52.579 --> 08:54.809
I believe she would want you to. Sure.

08:54.881 --> 08:58.373
Take it easy, you guys.
I just finished painting this place.

09:00.687 --> 09:03.713
No! My beautiful wall!

09:03.790 --> 09:07.556
I did this wall with my own hands
and now it looks like my first apartment.

09:07.694 --> 09:10.492
- It's just a little gouge.
- It's a giant crater!

09:10.563 --> 09:14.055
I'm gonna have to start from scratch!
Fill it, sand it!

09:14.300 --> 09:15.494
What's the problem?

09:15.602 --> 09:20.164
This. 10 years ago, I wouldn't have cared.
Now I want a wall to look like a wall.

09:20.240 --> 09:21.901
Let me take a look at it.

09:21.975 --> 09:25.433
- You don't have to do that.
- It's okay. I'm taking care of it.

09:25.512 --> 09:27.810
Thank you very much. That's great.

09:28.014 --> 09:29.504
Who says chivalry is dead?

09:30.083 --> 09:32.415
Alive and well in New York. Amazing.

09:35.021 --> 09:38.320
How does it feel to have your whole life
stuffed in little boxes?

09:38.558 --> 09:39.957
A little cramped.

09:42.762 --> 09:45.595
Here's the electrician's number.
He's expecting your call.

09:45.665 --> 09:49.157
Painter's coming on Sunday.
I'll get to the kitchen faucet soon.

09:49.502 --> 09:50.662
You'll fix it yourself?

09:51.171 --> 09:53.071
Sure. I'm the landlady.

09:53.139 --> 09:55.733
Hey, listen, I lost an earring...

09:55.809 --> 09:58.334
...maybe in your apartment.
It's pretty hard to miss.

09:58.411 --> 10:01.574
Then, it might be in my bag.
If you see it, will you let me know?

10:01.648 --> 10:02.876
I'll keep an eye out.

10:02.949 --> 10:06.544
- Great. How Is Carmen working out?
- Fine. She's terrific with Chris.

10:07.187 --> 10:08.484
Shit!

10:08.855 --> 10:12.382
These cops are going to do wonders
for my parking ticket situation.

10:12.659 --> 10:14.559
I'll put in a word for you downtown.

10:14.728 --> 10:17.720
If there's anything else you need,
I'm across the street.

10:17.797 --> 10:19.059
Officer?

10:19.199 --> 10:21.827
Have you started
writing that thing out yet?

10:29.843 --> 10:31.174
Look out!

10:31.978 --> 10:35.175
- The ball is in the clear. He scores!
- Wait for me!

10:45.191 --> 10:46.590
Marty Wertheimer, please.

10:46.659 --> 10:48.286
<i>- Who's calling?
- It's Cal Jamison.</i>

10:48.361 --> 10:50.352
<i>- Can you hold?
- Yes, I'll hold.</i>

10:53.933 --> 10:57.266
<i>I told you never to call me here.
What do you want? I'm a busy man.</i>

10:57.737 --> 10:59.102
Hi, buddy, how are you?

10:59.172 --> 11:03.404
<i>Great. Is that a great apartment
that I found for you all by myself?</i>

11:03.476 --> 11:05.535
<i>And how about the landlady?
Not bad, huh?</i>

11:05.812 --> 11:08.474
Do you know what I had to do to get that?

11:09.482 --> 11:11.643
By the way, where's my commission?

11:12.118 --> 11:15.281
Shut up already. You done great.
It's wonderful. No complaints.

11:15.455 --> 11:17.116
<i>Where are you? You're late.</i>

11:17.190 --> 11:18.452
I'm in the park.

11:18.558 --> 11:22.824
<i>- The park? You're supposed to be here.
- I'm on my way. I've got Chris with me.</i>

11:22.896 --> 11:23.885
<i>Great.</i>

11:23.963 --> 11:26.329
<i>- It's okay if I bring him?
- Yeah, please.</i>

11:26.399 --> 11:28.162
Okay. See you soon.

11:33.406 --> 11:34.737
Chris!

11:48.922 --> 11:51.982
This is unusual for Central Park.
What are you doing down here?

11:52.058 --> 11:54.652
What do you mean? I run here everyday.

11:54.727 --> 11:57.787
- Did you see anyone else here?
- No. Just me.

11:57.864 --> 11:59.889
- Is this all you saw?
- That's all I saw!

11:59.966 --> 12:02.093
Calm down, miss.
What are you doing here?

12:02.202 --> 12:06.036
I run here every day with my friend!
Today, she had to go to the dentist.

12:06.105 --> 12:08.232
- I'll need some information.
- Information?

12:08.308 --> 12:09.832
What kind of information?

12:09.909 --> 12:12.002
- Like your name first, please.
- My name?

12:12.078 --> 12:15.138
My name is Muriel Greenburg.

12:15.348 --> 12:18.283
Do you spell Greenburg: G-r-e-e-n-b-e-r-g?

12:18.685 --> 12:21.745
No. B-u-r-g. Greenburg.

12:22.856 --> 12:25.017
I may need more information later on.

12:25.158 --> 12:26.489
What's your address?

12:28.795 --> 12:29.887
Sorry.

12:33.499 --> 12:34.727
Come on.

12:34.968 --> 12:36.526
Folks, the show is over!

12:36.736 --> 12:40.672
I'm sure you can find something
better to do than look at this garbage.

12:40.740 --> 12:42.367
Come on, start moving.

12:42.508 --> 12:44.738
Get out of here, let's go.

12:45.211 --> 12:46.872
Keep moving.

12:46.980 --> 12:48.311
<i>Brujería.</i>

12:49.115 --> 12:50.582
Keep going.

12:50.683 --> 12:51.809
<i>Brujería.</i>

12:51.885 --> 12:53.876
All right, just keep going away.

12:55.255 --> 12:57.382
Dad, do you believe in God?

12:58.491 --> 13:00.482
I believe in a god.

13:01.261 --> 13:03.126
What you got there?

13:03.363 --> 13:04.352
May I?

13:07.267 --> 13:09.531
- Where'd you get this?
- Found it.

13:09.602 --> 13:11.661
- Where?
- In the park.

13:12.372 --> 13:13.896
Where in the park?

13:13.973 --> 13:16.533
Somewhere. It's a wishing shell.

13:16.609 --> 13:17.974
How do you know that?

13:18.811 --> 13:20.142
I just do.

13:21.447 --> 13:22.812
Where is he?

13:24.484 --> 13:25.883
There he is.

13:25.985 --> 13:28.283
- Hi, Marty.
- Chris, how are you doing?

13:28.354 --> 13:30.481
I've been waiting all morning for you.

13:30.556 --> 13:32.854
- How are you?
- Who's this bum?

13:32.926 --> 13:35.486
You have to watch these guys
who hang out in the park.

13:35.561 --> 13:37.153
- What's this?
- What?

13:37.630 --> 13:38.654
Bubble-gum?

13:38.731 --> 13:40.756
Don't you know where to park your gum?

13:40.833 --> 13:43.267
- Where?
- On the bedpost, for crying out loud.

13:43.336 --> 13:47.602
You got any questions about important
stuff like this, you come ask your lawyer.

13:47.674 --> 13:50.006
- Okay.
- Okay. I ever show you this one?

13:50.910 --> 13:52.002
Twice.

13:52.378 --> 13:56.610
Okay, wise guy, you get them apart.
I'll bring him right back. Promise.

13:56.783 --> 13:57.841
- Coffee?
- No.

13:57.917 --> 13:59.885
One. Regular. Thanks.

14:05.325 --> 14:08.522
Wait a minute.
We agree, so what's the problem?

14:08.594 --> 14:11.085
I don't have a problem
with the idea of a lawsuit.

14:11.164 --> 14:13.792
I don't want Chris to have to relive it all.

14:13.866 --> 14:14.992
Neither do I.

14:15.068 --> 14:17.332
But that coffee machine
was fuckin' defective...

14:17.403 --> 14:19.894
...and we gotta nail them
so no one else is killed.

14:19.973 --> 14:22.601
So long as Chris
doesn't have to testify. I mean it.

14:22.675 --> 14:25.508
- I feel very strongly about this.
- You and me both.

14:25.712 --> 14:29.478
This will not go to trial.
I promise you. They'd be crazy.

14:29.549 --> 14:31.517
They'll settle. Do you smoke?

14:31.584 --> 14:32.812
No, thanks, I quit.

14:32.885 --> 14:35.911
Yeah, me too.
I quit at least twice this week already.

14:38.057 --> 14:39.183
Thanks.

14:40.393 --> 14:43.294
I love Chris, you know that.
He's a great kid.

14:44.664 --> 14:48.065
Tell you the truth,
he's not the one I'm worried about.

14:55.742 --> 14:58.677
- I'm all right.
- That's it? "I'm all right"?

14:58.978 --> 15:01.412
You spend your time
listening to cops' problems...

15:01.481 --> 15:03.381
...you can't talk about your own?

15:05.885 --> 15:07.216
It's lonely.

15:07.754 --> 15:08.743
Yeah?

15:09.322 --> 15:11.654
I'm trying to pick up the pieces.

15:14.327 --> 15:16.386
It really feels strange being back.

15:17.196 --> 15:19.221
The city's changed a lot.

15:19.298 --> 15:23.428
Some days I'm not so sure
it was a good idea to bring Chris here.

15:23.836 --> 15:26.532
But in a funny way,
it's brought us closer together.

15:26.706 --> 15:30.699
You need anything at all,
I'm there before you hang up the phone.

15:30.843 --> 15:32.242
I know.

15:34.380 --> 15:36.780
- I feel better. You?
- I feel better.

15:36.849 --> 15:38.282
Sit down.

15:39.218 --> 15:42.517
Linda? You want to send in
Mr. Jamison, Esquire, please?

15:48.161 --> 15:49.492
What is this?

15:49.562 --> 15:51.223
My 11:00 number.

15:51.297 --> 15:53.026
Come on in, kid. Sit down.

15:56.502 --> 15:58.060
Get a load o' this.

16:16.089 --> 16:17.283
I win.

16:17.590 --> 16:18.818
Cheater.

16:23.329 --> 16:25.263
Hi, Carmen. Any calls?

16:25.364 --> 16:26.922
No calls.

16:27.233 --> 16:29.224
But this come for you.

16:29.669 --> 16:31.227
From where?

16:31.337 --> 16:33.862
It's a housewarming present
from Mrs. Halliday.

16:34.774 --> 16:37.834
- She make it herself, for you.
- Wasn't that nice?

16:44.484 --> 16:46.111
<i>It's very beautiful, si?</i>

16:47.453 --> 16:48.886
<i>Si.</i>

16:49.422 --> 16:50.719
Stunning.

17:06.305 --> 17:10.435
- Are there any more of these perishables?
- This is only dry stuff and spices.

17:10.510 --> 17:12.944
- And did you buy this radio here?
- In London.

17:13.012 --> 17:15.412
I'll have to take this apart. I'll put it back.

17:15.481 --> 17:17.881
<i>Arriving passengers
who have cleared customs...</i>

17:17.950 --> 17:20.349
<i>... place your luggage
on the conveyor belt...</i>

17:20.419 --> 17:22.011
Could I see that?

17:30.796 --> 17:32.229
Open this, please.

17:32.298 --> 17:34.198
Just personal items.

17:35.868 --> 17:37.529
No need to look in there.

17:49.415 --> 17:50.814
All right.

18:09.936 --> 18:12.427
Remember this bowl?
That little Indian boy made it.

18:12.505 --> 18:16.771
- We have one just like it.
- You do? I love the things he made.

18:16.909 --> 18:18.968
Vino? Where's the vino?

18:19.378 --> 18:22.040
- And cilantro.
- How's it going?

18:23.849 --> 18:25.214
Ambrosia.

18:25.651 --> 18:28.347
- Ambrosia!
- Taste.

18:30.356 --> 18:32.950
Well? What do you think?
Don't be bashful.

18:33.025 --> 18:34.890
- I'm inured to criticism.
- Hot.

18:34.994 --> 18:39.328
Nonsense. Good for you.
Therapeutic, anti-depressant.

18:40.499 --> 18:43.593
- News to me.
- I stand before you, living proof.

18:43.669 --> 18:47.400
You put the NYPD on gumbo twice a week,
and you're out of business.

18:47.573 --> 18:51.669
Why don't you give that a good stir
and then we'll bring in the rice.

18:52.411 --> 18:55.778
Useless knife. I'll have to get another.

18:57.750 --> 18:59.183
It's lovely.

18:59.252 --> 19:00.742
Who gave it to you?

19:00.820 --> 19:01.878
I found it.

19:01.954 --> 19:04.787
Really? Here. Show it to Dennis.

19:05.491 --> 19:07.516
- What's this?
- My shell.

19:09.095 --> 19:11.188
- It's your shell, is it?
- Yep.

19:11.764 --> 19:13.698
You seem pretty sure about that.

19:14.700 --> 19:17.168
It's a beautiful piece of work.
Have you seen this?

19:17.436 --> 19:18.528
Yes.

19:20.573 --> 19:23.906
You still got that thing, Chris?
That's his wishing shell.

19:25.278 --> 19:29.408
What do you suppose
you could make out of this?

19:30.683 --> 19:32.048
I don't know.

19:32.285 --> 19:34.583
What about a necklace?

19:38.124 --> 19:41.685
That's the day we went to Osage.
The reservation. Remember that?

19:41.761 --> 19:44.821
- Remember that?
- And the day I got Chief Black Cloud.

19:44.897 --> 19:46.194
That's right.

19:46.265 --> 19:48.165
And Dennis bought me the arrowheads.

19:48.367 --> 19:50.460
God. Got a memory like an elephant.

19:54.907 --> 19:56.397
There's Mom.

19:58.077 --> 20:00.068
She looked so pretty.

20:00.413 --> 20:02.745
That was a very happy day, wasn't it?

20:03.582 --> 20:05.243
My prize pupil.

20:05.384 --> 20:06.874
In anthropology?

20:07.086 --> 20:09.520
I always thought one day,
she'd be teaching me.

20:13.926 --> 20:15.757
Look at that face.

20:18.597 --> 20:22.089
That was the day
we went to visit the Ojibwa. Remember?

20:22.468 --> 20:24.629
About 40 degrees below zero.

20:25.471 --> 20:27.769
They had fires inside the tent.

20:27.973 --> 20:31.841
It must have been 70 degrees below,
with the wind chill.

20:32.511 --> 20:34.445
It was quite a day, wasn't it?

20:36.115 --> 20:37.446
I'm sorry.

20:39.719 --> 20:42.085
I remember taking those pictures.

20:43.422 --> 20:46.357
That was the last time
we were all together.

20:50.229 --> 20:51.856
Oh, my.

21:00.005 --> 21:03.202
How does Chris seem to you?
Does he seem all right?

21:05.745 --> 21:09.875
- He's a remarkable little boy.
- I think he's doing all right, actually.

21:11.584 --> 21:12.915
Thanks.

21:38.611 --> 21:41.045
The kitchen all fixed up, Dr. Jamison.

21:41.113 --> 21:42.341
Thank you, Carmen.

21:42.481 --> 21:44.108
<i>- Hasta mañana.
- Hasta mañana.</i>

21:44.517 --> 21:47.509
<i>- Buenas noches.
- Buenas noches.</i>

23:30.789 --> 23:32.484
We've got to stay back here.

23:32.558 --> 23:34.617
Sorry, you can't get through here.

23:40.900 --> 23:42.959
- Where is he?
- He's inside.

23:57.283 --> 23:59.012
- Lopez call this in?
- He did.

23:59.084 --> 24:01.882
- Where is he?
- Behind the screen. We can't get near him.

24:01.954 --> 24:03.148
Keeps asking for you.

24:03.222 --> 24:05.713
- What do you got?
- We got a dead kid.

24:07.459 --> 24:12.294
<i>I want you to understand that! Brujería.</i>

24:15.834 --> 24:16.960
How old is he?

24:17.036 --> 24:19.630
He looks to be about 9 years old.
He's only a kid.

24:19.705 --> 24:24.267
There's so much blood. Look at the ashes.
They're right around where the body was.

24:26.045 --> 24:27.945
Jesus Christ almighty.

24:29.715 --> 24:32.240
Just get McTaggert here, that's all.

24:33.752 --> 24:38.155
Don't you come any closer, all right?

24:38.390 --> 24:40.620
Don't do it. Quit fucking around with me!

24:40.693 --> 24:43.491
Nobody's fucking around with you.
Did you call this in?

24:43.562 --> 24:45.655
- Yes, Lieutenant.
- What's the problem?

24:45.731 --> 24:48.256
Jesus Christ,
did you see what they did to that kid?

24:48.934 --> 24:51.095
I saw. What do you know about it?

24:51.203 --> 24:53.933
- They took my badge.
- Who took your badge?

24:54.106 --> 24:55.664
Who took it, Tom?

24:56.208 --> 24:58.540
You don't know what they could do to me.

24:58.611 --> 25:01.739
You did a good job, now we're here.
Let us have it.

25:01.880 --> 25:04.144
We'll go to the station and make a report.

25:04.216 --> 25:05.205
No!

25:08.821 --> 25:10.812
You can't stop them.

25:10.923 --> 25:12.618
You can't do anything.

25:13.058 --> 25:14.821
You don't understand anything.

25:24.169 --> 25:25.363
It doesn't work!

25:32.344 --> 25:33.709
I'll be safe.

25:35.447 --> 25:36.744
Get the gun!

25:37.750 --> 25:39.843
Get him the hell out of here, fast!

25:40.052 --> 25:41.610
Why did you stop me?

25:41.754 --> 25:43.551
We can't do anything!

25:44.590 --> 25:46.057
<i>Brujería.</i>

25:47.259 --> 25:49.887
McTaggert. Get it straight!

25:53.098 --> 25:54.827
They know who I am!

26:01.040 --> 26:04.134
Let go! I'm a cop, too! Goddamn you!

26:54.593 --> 26:57.426
I'm here, Chris! It's all right.

26:57.763 --> 26:59.958
It's all right, sweetheart.

27:00.032 --> 27:02.023
It's just a bad dream.

27:02.401 --> 27:04.096
It's all right, baby.

27:32.698 --> 27:35.132
<i>- Hello?
- Is this Dr. Jamison?</i>

27:35.200 --> 27:36.189
Speaking.

27:36.869 --> 27:40.100
Good. This is Lt. McTaggert, 27th Precinct.

27:40.472 --> 27:42.201
<i>What can I do for you, Lieutenant?</i>

27:42.274 --> 27:45.402
I'm sorry, but I got your number
from Psych Services.

27:45.477 --> 27:49.243
I'm at Bellevue.
I've got an officer in a lot of trouble here.

27:50.149 --> 27:52.242
<i>You want me to come down now?</i>

27:52.317 --> 27:53.909
I'd appreciate that.

27:55.020 --> 27:59.013
It's McTaggert. I'll be waiting for you
at Psychiatric Emergency.

27:59.224 --> 28:01.624
<i>All right, give me about 20 minutes.</i>

28:08.167 --> 28:11.227
I understand you were working undercover
on the disappearance...

28:11.303 --> 28:14.101
...of some kids in Spanish Harlem.
Is that right, Tom?

28:15.541 --> 28:16.803
May I call you Tom?

28:18.944 --> 28:20.070
Are you Catholic?

28:21.046 --> 28:23.810
Yes, I am. I'm not a practicing Catholic.

28:26.785 --> 28:28.946
They know who I am!

28:29.822 --> 28:31.483
Who are "they"?

28:31.557 --> 28:34.924
No. How do I know about you?

28:36.628 --> 28:38.152
I understand.

28:38.230 --> 28:42.326
You have no reason to trust me,
but why distrust me?

28:43.669 --> 28:47.332
The spirits help them.
They walk through walls.

28:47.606 --> 28:49.506
- Don't forget that.
- I won't.

28:50.943 --> 28:53.434
They can see us in here now, is that it?

28:56.515 --> 28:58.312
What is it? Easy.

29:02.454 --> 29:07.414
They knew that I was on to them.
I walked in and they were waiting for me.

29:07.693 --> 29:11.823
- Can you identify them?
- No. When I came to, I found the body.

29:15.634 --> 29:18.467
They got my shield. Don't you get it?

29:20.639 --> 29:22.470
They're going to kill me.

29:23.709 --> 29:25.870
I can feel it's started already.

29:26.945 --> 29:29.937
Nobody can harm you in here.
I promise you that.

29:31.383 --> 29:34.546
God can't save you.
The church can't save you.

29:35.254 --> 29:38.348
They get right inside your body!
You can't stop them.

29:38.957 --> 29:40.254
Seven powers.

29:40.492 --> 29:42.619
You think that you can stop them?

29:42.761 --> 29:44.592
You think science can stop them?

29:47.232 --> 29:48.722
It's all right.

29:48.901 --> 29:50.528
The eyes.

29:51.069 --> 29:53.560
I saw his eyes!

29:53.906 --> 29:55.737
Whose eyes?

30:00.479 --> 30:03.243
They can get to anyone.
They can kill anybody!

30:04.616 --> 30:06.675
You want them to know who you are?

30:07.920 --> 30:09.285
Do you?

30:11.890 --> 30:15.053
- Do you think he'll come out of it?
- I need more time with him.

30:15.127 --> 30:18.392
- He was one of my best guys.
- Maybe I should see the victim.

30:18.530 --> 30:20.361
- You sure about that?
- Yeah.

30:20.432 --> 30:22.093
It's the kid's parents.

30:39.318 --> 30:40.444
Jesus.

30:42.254 --> 30:44.586
What kind of a monster does that?

31:00.739 --> 31:02.866
Been down to the freezer again?

31:03.208 --> 31:05.199
You're a real comedian.

31:06.678 --> 31:08.942
Don't be a stranger. Hit me again.

31:13.719 --> 31:15.983
No, thank you. Just coffee, please.

31:17.389 --> 31:21.826
Did we treat cops for alcohol abuse
back in Milwaukee?

31:21.893 --> 31:23.326
Minneapolis.

31:23.628 --> 31:25.289
Hello, Minneapolis.

31:25.864 --> 31:28.958
What the hell brought you to New York?
You don't mind my asking?

31:29.067 --> 31:30.898
I went to graduate school at Columbia.

31:31.003 --> 31:34.439
Nice school, shitty neighborhood.
You got a family?

31:34.773 --> 31:36.263
I have a son.

31:36.775 --> 31:38.140
Thank you.

31:40.612 --> 31:42.603
I lost my wife recently.

31:44.416 --> 31:46.077
I'm sorry to hear that.

31:46.818 --> 31:48.877
What did Lopez have on this?

31:49.221 --> 31:50.882
<i>Nada. Nothing.</i>

31:51.790 --> 31:53.587
Can I see his reports?

31:53.658 --> 31:54.647
No.

31:54.793 --> 31:56.090
Why not?

31:56.161 --> 31:59.426
- They're not available.
- Hope you're off duty, Lieutenant.

31:59.498 --> 32:00.624
Fuck off.

32:00.866 --> 32:01.958
Is Lopez Catholic?

32:02.334 --> 32:04.427
Sure. The family is Cuban.

32:05.003 --> 32:07.631
They practice a thing called Santería.
Ever hear of it?

32:07.706 --> 32:08.695
No.

32:08.807 --> 32:11.207
It's a Latin thing. A lot of them are into it.

32:11.276 --> 32:14.541
They cut up chickens, magic, shit like that.

32:14.713 --> 32:18.012
- And Lopez is into this?
- He kept it quiet.

32:18.817 --> 32:22.480
He found the body on an altar
with a lot of religious paraphernalia, right?

32:22.554 --> 32:25.284
There's at least 200 places
that sell that shit.

32:25.357 --> 32:29.350
Wait a second. I'm evaluating a patient.
That's a pretty strong lead.

32:29.628 --> 32:32.597
A citizen's got a right
to his own religious preference.

32:32.664 --> 32:36.031
If he performs a human sacrifice,
I'd say he forfeits that right.

32:36.101 --> 32:39.468
A psycho kills a kid,
he makes it look like a religious ritual.

32:39.538 --> 32:43.804
That kid was cut up with the precision
of a surgeon, not a psychopath.

32:43.942 --> 32:46.342
What are you afraid of,
that Lopez is a suspect?

32:46.711 --> 32:48.611
That it's one of your own?

32:49.648 --> 32:51.206
It's not this religion?

32:51.416 --> 32:54.408
I don't call cutting up chickens a religion!

32:55.821 --> 33:00.155
If you knew the barrio the way I do,
you wouldn't ask such dumb questions.

33:00.225 --> 33:01.715
That's bullshit.

33:01.927 --> 33:03.690
Just one last question.

33:04.329 --> 33:07.765
Is this all the assistance I'll get
trying to help that officer?

33:09.067 --> 33:10.534
Think about it.

33:10.802 --> 33:12.463
Thanks for the coffee.

33:24.649 --> 33:26.844
Oh, no! My clothes!

33:40.665 --> 33:43.759
<i>"Santería is 1,000 years older
than Christianity...</i>

33:46.838 --> 33:49.068
<i>"...brought by slaves to the Caribbean.</i>

33:53.478 --> 33:56.311
<i>"Their African gods are hidden in

35:02.347 --> 35:03.575
God.

36:05.176 --> 36:06.234
Hi.

36:06.411 --> 36:07.400
Hi.

36:07.779 --> 36:09.440
You forgot your watch.

36:09.681 --> 36:10.807
Did I?

36:11.683 --> 36:14.243
You must have left it
when you were painting.

36:14.819 --> 36:18.482
You forgot these, too.
They're a little soggy.

36:18.623 --> 36:19.612
Thanks.

36:19.691 --> 36:21.716
Still can't find the earring.

36:24.963 --> 36:26.658
Want to come in?

36:29.434 --> 36:30.731
Thank you.

37:20.919 --> 37:23.854
I have no idea what I would I have done
without the watch.

37:23.922 --> 37:27.517
You suppose my leaving it
was some hidden expression of desire?

37:27.826 --> 37:31.159
I don't know that,
but my returning it certainly was.

37:37.569 --> 37:39.230
How long has it been?

37:40.605 --> 37:42.095
About nine months.

37:44.442 --> 37:46.000
Would she approve?

37:47.479 --> 37:48.810
I approve.

37:51.950 --> 37:54.612
I went a whole year after my divorce.

37:56.755 --> 37:58.245
When was that?

37:59.257 --> 38:00.884
About a year ago.

38:01.159 --> 38:02.820
But who's counting?

38:06.898 --> 38:09.389
Didn't you used to live in New York?

38:09.467 --> 38:11.401
Back when I was young and foolish.

38:11.836 --> 38:13.667
What does that make you now?

38:22.814 --> 38:24.805
I should probably get back.

38:38.630 --> 38:40.621
Hurry up or we'll miss the show!

38:40.832 --> 38:43.824
There's time for at least
another half a glass.

38:43.902 --> 38:45.426
As you wish, madam.

38:45.937 --> 38:48.167
And you, madam.
How about you, Carmen?

38:48.239 --> 38:49.729
<i>No, gracias.</i>

38:49.808 --> 38:52.174
Come on, you're no stranger to the grape.

38:52.677 --> 38:56.443
Sounds like fun. I haven't been
to the Planetarium since I was a girl.

38:56.514 --> 38:58.175
Why don't you join us?

38:58.616 --> 39:00.516
As we begin our journey...

39:00.652 --> 39:02.415
...to the beginning of time...

39:08.827 --> 39:10.294
What are you looking for?

39:10.528 --> 39:12.860
- Where's my shell?
- I don't know.

39:13.364 --> 39:15.628
Where is it? Did she take it?

39:15.700 --> 39:17.292
Just a minute, young man!

39:17.535 --> 39:19.230
Come back here!

39:23.374 --> 39:24.705
What are you doing?

39:24.976 --> 39:26.773
- It was an accident!
- It was not!

39:26.845 --> 39:28.073
It was!

39:28.179 --> 39:30.579
- I'll go.
- Don't worry about it.

39:31.015 --> 39:33.006
- It's no big deal.
- He's tired.

39:33.117 --> 39:35.142
- I'll get it, Carmen.
- It's no problem.

39:35.220 --> 39:36.812
Just a minute, what is that?

39:37.722 --> 39:39.883
That's one of my hankies. May I?

39:43.027 --> 39:46.292
- What did she say?
- She said that she did it. It's not bad.

39:51.569 --> 39:54.231
She says she's a kind of matchmaker.

39:54.405 --> 39:56.236
A yenta. Do you know what that is?

39:56.307 --> 39:58.537
What's that got to do with this?

40:00.011 --> 40:01.638
That's my earring.

40:05.083 --> 40:07.574
She said she cast a love spell on us.

40:08.086 --> 40:11.021
- That's ridiculous.
- I'm sorry you feel that way.

40:11.089 --> 40:14.684
This is nothing bad.
You're such a nice couple.

40:15.760 --> 40:16.954
Don't look at me.

40:17.028 --> 40:20.691
I like a guy, maybe I'll change my perfume,
but I've got my pride.

40:28.773 --> 40:30.604
<i>This is Lt. Mc Taggert.</i>

40:30.942 --> 40:32.466
What can I do for you?

40:32.877 --> 40:35.437
<i>- Has Tom Lopez called you?
- No, why?</i>

40:35.513 --> 40:39.108
<i>He took a hike from Bellevue last night.
You better get over here.</i>

40:39.217 --> 40:40.206
<i>What is it?</i>

40:40.285 --> 40:43.448
<i>We got another kid like the one
from the movie house.</i>

40:43.621 --> 40:45.088
<i>Pier 11.</i>

40:52.864 --> 40:54.695
Look over there. What is that?

41:00.805 --> 41:01.794
Lieutenant.

41:01.873 --> 41:04.034
The body is down here.

41:04.242 --> 41:06.005
Worse than the one before.

41:06.177 --> 41:07.439
How old is he?

41:07.912 --> 41:11.245
8. 10. No I.D. He's a black kid.

41:12.083 --> 41:13.880
Watch your step. It's a tough climb.

41:14.018 --> 41:16.578
They didn't tell me this was part of the job.

41:16.788 --> 41:19.018
They don't tell you a lot of things.

41:31.169 --> 41:33.330
It's just like the kid in the theatre.

41:35.440 --> 41:36.964
He's been here a couple of days.

41:37.041 --> 41:40.533
You got the red and black candles,
and the circle of ashes.

41:40.945 --> 41:42.606
And a bottle of gasoline.

41:42.680 --> 41:45.774
- Look at the way he's cut up.
- So much blood.

42:07.572 --> 42:09.130
Jesus Christ!

42:09.574 --> 42:11.769
How do you ever get used to it?

42:11.943 --> 42:13.342
You don't.

42:13.911 --> 42:16.641
Now maybe you know why
a lot of cops hit the bottle.

42:17.582 --> 42:18.913
Listen, Doc.

42:20.018 --> 42:24.751
Newspapers find out some psycho cop
is doing this, my job gets shittier than it is.

42:24.822 --> 42:27.017
Do me a favor.
No details to anybody, huh?

42:27.091 --> 42:28.490
Psycho cop?

42:30.094 --> 42:33.894
Do you think a few hours on the couch
and Lopez will get himself together?

42:33.965 --> 42:35.865
You don't know that he did it.

42:35.933 --> 42:39.994
I don't know that he didn't.
Lopez hasn't called you, has he?

42:40.071 --> 42:41.299
No.

42:43.374 --> 42:46.207
Weird fucking city you moved into, Doc.

43:01.793 --> 43:03.124
Lopez.

44:13.564 --> 44:16.260
Excuse me.
Could I talk to you for a second, please?

44:16.334 --> 44:17.460
What do you want?

44:18.102 --> 44:22.368
I'm looking for the man that wrote this.
Oscar Sezine. Is he here?

44:23.107 --> 44:24.267
We're closed.

44:24.342 --> 44:28.540
I just need a minute of his time.
Believe me, it's very important.

44:28.713 --> 44:31.238
- There is no one here.
- Wait a second.

44:32.917 --> 44:34.043
Sir!

44:35.720 --> 44:37.381
I'm with Psych Services...

44:37.522 --> 44:38.853
...NYPD!

44:43.594 --> 44:44.925
Thanks a lot!

45:15.626 --> 45:16.923
Carmen.

45:18.229 --> 45:20.720
What is all this stuff?
What are these things?

45:21.065 --> 45:23.158
You put them in Chris's room, didn't you?

45:23.234 --> 45:25.168
<i>- Si.
- I want to know why.</i>

45:25.236 --> 45:27.101
To bless him. I'm trying to help him.

45:27.171 --> 45:29.162
I'm trying to help him, too.

45:29.607 --> 45:32.303
Sometimes these are used in rituals,
aren't they?

45:34.212 --> 45:35.201
<i>Si.</i>

45:35.279 --> 45:39.272
Sometimes those rituals
involve animal sacrifice, don't they?

45:40.251 --> 45:41.741
Sometimes.

45:43.087 --> 45:45.419
What is the circle of ashes for?

45:45.790 --> 45:49.055
Circle of ashes?
I don't know nothing about that.

45:49.694 --> 45:51.787
- That's not a part of Santería?
- No.

45:54.532 --> 45:59.299
If I find this kind of stuff around here again,
I'll have to let you go, is that clear?

45:59.370 --> 46:00.530
<i>This is for protección.</i>

46:00.605 --> 46:03.802
I don't care what it's for.
It's a lot of superstitious nonsense.

46:04.075 --> 46:06.635
And I don't want
any more of it in the house.

46:07.778 --> 46:10.906
Do you want any of these,
'cause I'm going to throw them away.

46:19.857 --> 46:21.722
Which one of these guys do you want?

46:21.792 --> 46:24.590
How about that guy? He looks pretty neat.

46:25.830 --> 46:28.663
It's your birthday,
you can have any one you want.

46:28.733 --> 46:31.224
Come on, Bean,
you've gotta make up your mind.

46:32.603 --> 46:34.935
- I'll take that.
- This one?

46:36.173 --> 46:37.834
Happy birthday, sir.

46:38.676 --> 46:40.473
What do you say to Jessica?

46:40.945 --> 46:42.173
Thanks.

46:43.848 --> 46:45.406
Why are you so sad today?

46:45.483 --> 46:47.542
Three ices, please. Hurry up, you guys.

46:47.652 --> 46:48.641
Lemon.

46:48.786 --> 46:51.346
- What flavor do you want?
- I don't want any.

46:51.422 --> 46:52.855
Come on, sure you do.

46:53.157 --> 46:54.488
No, I don't!

46:55.092 --> 46:56.423
I'm sorry.

46:58.562 --> 47:00.052
- This is really...
- No!

47:17.848 --> 47:19.543
- Goddamn it!
- No!

47:19.951 --> 47:23.114
- Don't you ever...
- I don't want toys or anything from her!

47:23.421 --> 47:25.446
She's not my mom! I want my mom!

47:25.690 --> 47:29.148
Shut up and listen!
Do you know you almost killed yourself!

47:29.260 --> 47:30.818
I want my mom!

47:31.195 --> 47:33.129
Come back here!

47:41.439 --> 47:43.634
Happy birthday, Chris!

47:50.247 --> 47:51.680
I'm sorry.

47:53.284 --> 47:55.149
I'm so sorry if I hurt you.

47:55.753 --> 47:57.050
Listen to me.

47:57.254 --> 48:00.781
You know I loved your mother very much,
and I'll always love her.

48:00.891 --> 48:02.222
But she's gone now.

48:02.360 --> 48:04.988
- You don't care that she went away!
- That's not true.

48:05.062 --> 48:07.189
You wouldn't care if I went away!

48:07.298 --> 48:10.165
- You know that's not true.
- You hit me!

48:10.234 --> 48:13.670
I'm sorry I hit you.
I promise I'll never hit you again.

48:13.771 --> 48:15.830
I'll never do anything to hurt you.

48:16.607 --> 48:19.132
You mean more to me
than anyone else in the world.

48:19.210 --> 48:20.905
Don't you know that?

48:25.850 --> 48:27.841
I love you so much.

48:29.086 --> 48:30.747
Please forgive me.

48:32.690 --> 48:35.215
I just wanted him
to have a really nice birthday.

48:35.292 --> 48:38.125
- He still can.
- It's not over yet.

48:38.562 --> 48:41.588
- I didn't mean any harm.
- Of course you didn't.

48:41.866 --> 48:44.528
You know how children are
with new people.

48:45.870 --> 48:47.531
Dr. Jamison.

48:51.742 --> 48:53.733
I'll take it up here!

48:55.813 --> 48:56.939
Hello.

48:57.081 --> 48:59.174
<i>- It's Lopez.
- Where are you?</i>

48:59.250 --> 49:02.185
There's a diner on 126th and Lexington.

49:03.154 --> 49:06.214
Come alone, okay? Just you.

49:06.390 --> 49:07.755
<i>What do you mean?</i>

49:08.759 --> 49:11.592
You're in danger.
You and your son. Hurry.

50:50.461 --> 50:51.985
Are you okay?

50:52.530 --> 50:53.588
<i>Si.</i>

50:53.931 --> 50:56.126
<i>Agua, por favor. Caliente.</i>

51:55.659 --> 51:57.286
<i>Qué pasa?</i>

52:37.101 --> 52:38.830
It's all right. Let him through.

52:39.069 --> 52:42.095
- What are you doing here?
- Lopez called me and told me to come.

52:42.206 --> 52:45.039
Why didn't you call me?
We're supposed to work together.

52:45.109 --> 52:47.634
Please, ma'am, stand back.

52:48.512 --> 52:50.412
- Did you know him?
- No. I don't.

52:51.115 --> 52:54.175
- He was never here before?
- I've never seen him.

52:56.353 --> 52:58.548
What did he tell you when he called?

52:58.622 --> 53:00.817
Nothing. He just told me to meet him.

53:01.492 --> 53:03.460
Did you understand
anything he was saying?

53:03.527 --> 53:06.963
<i>Yes. He kept saying, "Culebras!"</i>

53:07.064 --> 53:08.725
Who the hell is Culebras?

53:08.866 --> 53:11.357
Nobody, sir. That means "snakes."

53:11.535 --> 53:12.934
Snakes?

53:14.972 --> 53:18.806
Did he do anything else
before he started screaming?

53:20.044 --> 53:23.980
He was writing, and then he took the knife
and stabbed himself.

53:24.081 --> 53:28.017
- Where did he get the knife?
- From behind the counter. I was using it.

53:28.852 --> 53:30.752
Does that mean anything to you?

53:39.396 --> 53:42.524
I'm talking to you in English,
you're talking to her in Spanish.

53:42.599 --> 53:47.263
What is this, a three-ring circus?
Are you giving me a hard time?

53:47.504 --> 53:50.667
- I'm not giving you a hard time.
- Are these all the files?

54:08.792 --> 54:10.453
Oscar Sezine?

54:11.161 --> 54:13.391
Why wouldn't you talk to me before?

54:13.797 --> 54:15.458
Did you bring the police here?

54:15.532 --> 54:17.557
- Hey, you, Sezine.
- Yes?

54:17.634 --> 54:19.795
Get in here. I want to talk to you.

54:21.905 --> 54:24.237
Who is this guy? A friend of yours?

54:26.110 --> 54:28.510
What the hell is this place, anyway?

54:29.446 --> 54:32.210
This is a licensed drug rehab center?

54:32.483 --> 54:35.680
Our doors are open to troubled children.
We offer them help.

54:35.753 --> 54:37.914
Even your own kid OD'd.

54:38.889 --> 54:39.878
Yes.

54:40.591 --> 54:42.718
Is that why you're here?

54:42.793 --> 54:43.987
Hey, wise guy.

54:44.061 --> 54:47.895
I'm here to talk to you about Tom Lopez.
Did you know he was a cop?

54:47.965 --> 54:52.026
Yes. He's also a volunteer on staff.
He teaches boxing.

54:52.136 --> 54:54.604
- Coaches our Golden Gloves.
- Not anymore.

54:55.072 --> 54:56.733
He killed himself an hour ago.

55:01.812 --> 55:03.746
- I'm shocked.
- I bet you are.

55:05.983 --> 55:10.147
Is this kid here, Louis Montana,
part of your drug rehabilitation program?

55:10.687 --> 55:13.622
He was. He ran away last week.

55:13.757 --> 55:16.885
- Did you see him after he ran away?
- No.

55:16.994 --> 55:19.519
- Did Lopez know him?
- He coached him.

55:19.596 --> 55:21.223
You saw them together?

55:21.398 --> 55:22.387
Yes, why?

55:22.466 --> 55:25.799
We found Louis Montana's body
on a Hudson River barge yesterday.

55:25.869 --> 55:28.997
- Would you know anything about that?
- Certainly not.

55:29.106 --> 55:33.440
You have a right to remain silent.
Anything you say can be used against you.

55:33.977 --> 55:37.777
You have the right to an attorney.
If you can't afford one, we'll provide one.

55:37.848 --> 55:39.338
Is that clear?

55:40.918 --> 55:42.909
You! Get out of here!

55:43.220 --> 55:44.380
Fuck off.

55:46.190 --> 55:47.680
You know what I'd like to do?

55:47.758 --> 55:50.625
I'd like to put this monkey on a grill
and fry his ass...

55:50.694 --> 55:54.858
...until I get some answers about this
Santería bullshit from you people.

55:55.265 --> 55:59.395
That's my number at the precinct.
Call me tomorrow. Don't forget.

56:02.172 --> 56:03.662
He hasn't slept for two days.

56:07.211 --> 56:09.145
If you're not a cop, what are you?

56:09.746 --> 56:13.307
I'm a therapist.
Tom Lopez is one of my patients.

56:16.386 --> 56:18.718
I'm really very sorry about all this.

56:21.792 --> 56:23.851
Do you really think we are savages?

56:24.394 --> 56:26.885
That we are capable of killing children?

56:28.065 --> 56:32.297
You said in your book that human sacrifice
was practiced at one time.

56:32.402 --> 56:36.896
Name one religion where atrocities have
not been committed in the name of a god.

56:38.475 --> 56:41.137
Santería is a force for good.

56:41.345 --> 56:44.075
It is not a blood-cult
trading on innocent lives!

56:44.181 --> 56:47.412
- What are you people so afraid of?
- Of your ignorance.

56:47.718 --> 56:51.984
Of your prejudice,
because you use it as a weapon against us.

56:53.123 --> 56:55.614
Tom Lopez was a good and decent man.

56:56.026 --> 56:58.017
He was devoted to these children.

56:59.096 --> 57:03.624
I don't believe he committed suicide
or had anything to do with that outrage!

57:05.369 --> 57:06.529
Neither do I.

57:11.975 --> 57:14.170
Robert Calder
is the chairman of your board?

57:14.778 --> 57:16.746
Yes. He's our major contributor.

57:18.148 --> 57:20.139
- He's not into Santería?
- No.

57:20.717 --> 57:22.082
Did Lopez know him?

57:22.219 --> 57:24.414
We all do. He organizes our fundraisers.

57:25.389 --> 57:29.758
This says there's a fundraiser this week.
Could you arrange for me to go?

57:31.495 --> 57:32.484
Yes.

58:11.702 --> 58:14.671
- Dad, can we stop by the church?
- Why?

58:14.805 --> 58:16.796
I want to light a candle for Mom.

59:18.734 --> 59:20.565
<i>This is chekete.</i>

59:20.670 --> 59:22.570
I'd prefer a vodka tonic.

59:22.705 --> 59:26.038
I'm afraid this is all we are serving.
It's traditional.

59:29.745 --> 59:32.407
It is also traditional to sip it slowly.

59:32.748 --> 59:34.409
I can see that.

59:35.785 --> 59:37.650
Our host. Excuse me.

59:40.956 --> 59:42.787
Robert Calder. Quite a guy.

59:42.958 --> 59:45.893
- What do you know about him?
- Not much. Self-made man.

59:46.195 --> 59:48.755
He turned one midtown-building share
into a fortune.

59:49.532 --> 59:53.127
Now he's into everything.
Money markets, energy, the whole bit.

59:54.870 --> 59:58.033
The person I spoke to you about
would like to meet you.

59:58.140 --> 01:00:00.370
May I introduce Dr. Cal Jamison?

01:00:00.443 --> 01:00:01.876
How do you do, sir.

01:00:01.944 --> 01:00:03.935
- My friend, Jessica Halliday.
- Hello.

01:00:04.013 --> 01:00:05.480
Pleased to meet you.

01:00:05.548 --> 01:00:07.448
I'm Jennifer, Mr. Calder's assistant.

01:00:07.550 --> 01:00:09.415
Oscar's told me of your interest.

01:00:09.485 --> 01:00:12.511
A friend told me about your organization.
I'm very impressed.

01:00:12.588 --> 01:00:14.749
- You are the sort of man we want.
- Really?

01:00:14.990 --> 01:00:18.153
I believe you knew my friend.
Officer Tom Lopez.

01:00:18.227 --> 01:00:20.320
Terrible tragedy. Did you know him well?

01:00:20.463 --> 01:00:22.124
Not as well as I wanted to.

01:00:22.298 --> 01:00:23.822
I suppose none of us did.

01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:28.061
We always wish we'd known someone
better when they die unexpectedly.

01:00:28.671 --> 01:00:30.832
I lost my only son five years ago.

01:00:31.507 --> 01:00:34.670
Drug overdose. I live with that every day.

01:00:35.611 --> 01:00:37.943
It tests one's faith, doesn't it?

01:00:38.981 --> 01:00:41.211
It can also help you find it.

01:00:42.518 --> 01:00:44.679
Are you a religious man?

01:00:45.287 --> 01:00:46.686
Yes and no.

01:00:47.123 --> 01:00:48.784
Sign of the times.

01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:53.351
The representative
from the mayor's office is here.

01:00:54.430 --> 01:00:57.092
I hope we can work together.
It was a pleasure.

01:00:57.333 --> 01:00:59.301
Pleasure meeting you, Mr. Calder.

01:00:59.368 --> 01:01:00.665
- Bob.
- Bob.

01:01:03.672 --> 01:01:04.502
Goodbye.

01:01:07.476 --> 01:01:08.875
Would you like a cigar?

01:01:08.978 --> 01:01:10.809
No, thanks. I'm trying to cut down.

01:01:10.946 --> 01:01:14.712
- Smoke attracts the gods.
- It makes them want to join the party.

01:01:15.317 --> 01:01:16.978
How about that?

01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:20.481
I'm gonna go pee. I'll be right back.

01:01:48.517 --> 01:01:50.849
- Did they show you a warrant?
- They did.

01:01:51.187 --> 01:01:55.180
How could anybody think
that anybody in our organization...

01:01:55.524 --> 01:01:57.651
...could do something so monstrous?

01:01:58.694 --> 01:02:00.958
Clearly they made a mistake.

01:02:01.397 --> 01:02:03.797
- Let the lawyers handle it.
- I tell you...

01:02:03.966 --> 01:02:06.662
...if all the good work we've done
is destroyed by this...

01:02:06.735 --> 01:02:09.397
That's not gonna happen,
you have my word on that.

01:02:09.872 --> 01:02:11.669
What is the detective's name?

01:02:11.740 --> 01:02:13.071
McTaggert.

01:02:13.742 --> 01:02:15.141
Lt. McTaggert.

01:02:15.478 --> 01:02:17.503
I don't want you to worry about this.

01:02:33.796 --> 01:02:37.926
<i>We are proud to present the chairman
of our board, Mr. Robert Calder.</i>

01:02:43.973 --> 01:02:47.841
<i>Thank you. On behalf
of the A.C.H.E. Program...</i>

01:02:50.679 --> 01:02:54.877
<i>... I'm especially proud to say that
thanks to your generous contributions...</i>

01:02:54.950 --> 01:02:56.884
<i>... during our sixth year...</i>

01:02:56.952 --> 01:02:59.614
<i>... A.C.H.E. Program offices...</i>

01:02:59.688 --> 01:03:03.647
<i>... will be opening in Detroit, Los Angeles,
Miami and Washington, D.C.</i>

01:03:06.629 --> 01:03:10.588
<i>I have a check here for $50,000.
Now, this is a personal check.</i>

01:03:10.833 --> 01:03:12.824
<i>Don't worry, I'm good for it.</i>

01:03:14.303 --> 01:03:16.464
<i>My challenge to you tonight...</i>

01:03:16.805 --> 01:03:21.139
<i>... is that collectively we top
the contributions that were made last year.</i>

01:03:21.477 --> 01:03:23.809
<i>Our helpers will be moving amongst you.</i>

01:03:24.146 --> 01:03:27.638
<i>The next hand you feel in your pocket
may not be your own.</i>

01:03:28.817 --> 01:03:33.811
<i>We'd like to collect $425,111...</i>

01:03:34.290 --> 01:03:35.882
<i>... from this room!</i>

01:03:36.592 --> 01:03:38.822
<i>Now I know you're up to it.</i>

01:03:39.161 --> 01:03:40.822
<i>I have faith!</i>

01:03:41.664 --> 01:03:44.997
<i>And remember, it's still tax deductible.</i>

01:03:56.312 --> 01:03:57.506
Thank you.

01:04:40.656 --> 01:04:42.248
What should we do?

01:05:26.902 --> 01:05:29.234
Don't touch him! He's not one of us!

01:05:29.505 --> 01:05:30.494
Go!

01:06:39.141 --> 01:06:41.302
What the hell are you doing? Stop it!

01:06:41.810 --> 01:06:43.072
Get away from him!

01:06:46.215 --> 01:06:47.273
Get out!

01:06:48.484 --> 01:06:49.712
Stay with him!

01:06:50.152 --> 01:06:52.450
I warned you about this.
You're fired! Get out!

01:06:52.521 --> 01:06:53.852
You don't understand!

01:06:53.989 --> 01:06:56.082
You don't understand! You're fired!

01:06:56.325 --> 01:06:58.816
He's in danger! I'm trying to protect him!

01:06:58.994 --> 01:07:01.986
The kid is hysterical! Get out!

01:07:02.397 --> 01:07:03.728
I don't want to hear!

01:07:03.999 --> 01:07:06.092
Let me finish doing this!

01:07:06.201 --> 01:07:08.032
You are finished! Go!

01:07:08.103 --> 01:07:11.595
- You don't know what you're doing!
- I know exactly what I'm doing!

01:07:14.777 --> 01:07:17.109
My God, you're killing me!

01:07:18.447 --> 01:07:21.382
If I see you around here again,
I'll call the police.

01:07:21.450 --> 01:07:23.008
Is that clear enough?

01:07:36.131 --> 01:07:38.929
- What's the matter with you guys?
- It won't happen again.

01:07:39.134 --> 01:07:40.965
It happens all the time!

01:07:41.303 --> 01:07:44.932
Do me a favor. Keep the greens
on the desk, not in the box!

01:07:45.808 --> 01:07:49.710
You always say, "I'm sorry"!
Get your act together!

01:07:54.616 --> 01:07:55.776
Cal.

01:07:56.652 --> 01:07:59.348
- How are you doing?
- Lieutenant? Is this a bad time?

01:07:59.421 --> 01:08:01.912
It's always a bad time around here.

01:08:02.224 --> 01:08:03.691
Let's go.

01:08:05.561 --> 01:08:07.722
- What's up?
- What's in here.

01:08:09.865 --> 01:08:14.029
Sezine's story on his son checks out.
Autopsy confirms the kid OD'd.

01:08:15.571 --> 01:08:18.540
That's what I expected.
What about the Calder boy?

01:08:18.674 --> 01:08:21.506
Same thing. Overdose five years ago.

01:08:26.448 --> 01:08:30.942
Five years ago, this boy was 8 years old.
8-year-olds don't usually OD.

01:08:31.053 --> 01:08:34.545
- Where's the autopsy report?
- I can't find it.

01:08:35.057 --> 01:08:36.649
Are you serious?

01:08:36.825 --> 01:08:38.759
Nobody knows where it is.

01:08:40.595 --> 01:08:44.157
Are you saying you lost it,
or somebody doesn't want it found?

01:08:44.233 --> 01:08:45.359
Listen.

01:08:45.634 --> 01:08:49.229
We're dropping this investigation.
We're laying the murders on Lopez.

01:08:49.304 --> 01:08:52.535
Lopez didn't kill anybody but himself.
Where is this coming from?

01:08:52.608 --> 01:08:56.135
Lopez is dead.
We got him tied to the kids.

01:08:56.278 --> 01:09:00.612
He took his life out of his own guilt.
We got enough to close now!

01:09:01.383 --> 01:09:04.216
Who the hell do you think you're kidding?

01:09:06.955 --> 01:09:08.252
You want...

01:09:10.359 --> 01:09:11.917
...me to show you?

01:09:33.615 --> 01:09:35.173
Come here.

01:09:38.953 --> 01:09:40.785
You didn't see this.

01:09:47.194 --> 01:09:48.526
<i>Culebras.</i>

01:10:05.213 --> 01:10:08.546
- Sorry we're late.
- No problem. We're all set.

01:10:09.051 --> 01:10:10.712
All right. All aboard.

01:10:11.219 --> 01:10:15.280
Plenty of good seats still available.
Tickets please.

01:10:15.357 --> 01:10:17.348
I have my ticket.

01:10:18.894 --> 01:10:20.987
Now listen, be a good boy.

01:10:21.063 --> 01:10:25.159
I'll be out in a couple of days and we'll
go to Santa Fe to see your grandparents.

01:10:25.233 --> 01:10:27.428
- I'm going to go sailing.
- Sailing?

01:10:27.502 --> 01:10:30.767
I fully expect you to be captain of the ship,
Mr. Christopher.

01:10:30.839 --> 01:10:33.774
I'll call tomorrow
and you'll tell me all about it.

01:10:34.109 --> 01:10:35.633
I love you, Dad.

01:10:36.511 --> 01:10:38.172
I love you, too.

01:10:41.717 --> 01:10:43.048
Have a great time, kiddo.

01:10:59.534 --> 01:11:03.402
- All ashore that's going ashore.
- Come along, matey, here we go!

01:11:03.772 --> 01:11:05.137
Watch your feet.

01:11:05.207 --> 01:11:07.471
- Don't worry about anything.
- Thanks.

01:11:07.542 --> 01:11:11.205
See you both Friday.
I have a glorious dinner planned.

01:11:11.279 --> 01:11:12.871
- See you.
- Bye, Dad.

01:11:35.370 --> 01:11:38.931
Why would my housekeeper
take it from my son? Is it Santería?

01:11:39.441 --> 01:11:41.534
No, this is not Santería.

01:11:42.310 --> 01:11:44.369
<i>It is black magic. Brujería.</i>

01:11:45.013 --> 01:11:48.414
This symbol belongs to a god
of destruction and pestilence...

01:11:48.650 --> 01:11:50.311
<i>...El engaסador, the trickster.</i>

01:11:50.385 --> 01:11:52.876
What does it have to do with my son?

01:11:52.954 --> 01:11:54.285
There was...

01:11:54.856 --> 01:11:56.187
...a ritual...

01:11:56.491 --> 01:12:00.951
...when a tribe was threatened by drought,
flood or destruction by its enemies.

01:12:01.496 --> 01:12:04.158
Three children were offered to the god.

01:12:04.232 --> 01:12:05.324
Sacrificed?

01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:08.096
Elder sons sacrificed by their fathers.

01:12:08.170 --> 01:12:10.195
- The last child, at summer solstice.
- Why?

01:12:10.305 --> 01:12:13.035
To gain power, to destroy their enemies.

01:12:13.141 --> 01:12:16.702
I've seen the bodies of two children.
This ritual is being performed now.

01:12:17.679 --> 01:12:19.078
Was Carmen involved?

01:12:19.214 --> 01:12:23.810
No, I believe she tried to cast a spell
of protection. She was not strong enough.

01:12:23.885 --> 01:12:25.216
It was turned against her.

01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:26.685
Protection from what?

01:12:27.389 --> 01:12:30.620
You both felt the power of the man
who killed Tom Lopez...

01:12:30.692 --> 01:12:32.956
...and those two children. I'm sure of it.

01:12:33.061 --> 01:12:35.222
You looked into his eyes.

01:12:36.998 --> 01:12:39.262
Did Calder bring that man here?

01:12:39.868 --> 01:12:42.769
I believe that's what Lopez
was trying to tell you.

01:12:43.305 --> 01:12:45.603
What can I do? Please, tell me.

01:12:46.041 --> 01:12:50.375
The summer solstice is on June 21st.
Four days away.

01:12:50.846 --> 01:12:53.474
You must seek protection for your son...

01:12:53.782 --> 01:12:55.579
...and for yourself.

01:12:57.319 --> 01:12:59.844
<i>I'd need a priest, a Santero.</i>

01:13:01.556 --> 01:13:03.217
<i>I am a Santero.</i>

01:13:04.192 --> 01:13:07.184
You must trust me and do as I say.

01:13:13.535 --> 01:13:16.265
- We shouldn't be doing this.
- You don't have to stay.

01:13:18.406 --> 01:13:21.102
- I think we should both leave, right now.
- No.

01:13:21.843 --> 01:13:23.674
This doesn't feel right.

01:13:33.588 --> 01:13:36.580
- Cal, please!
- I don't know what else to do.

01:13:49.204 --> 01:13:50.694
Please kneel.

01:14:43.024 --> 01:14:45.015
Water to purify.

01:14:47.896 --> 01:14:50.694
May your enemies never see
what we are doing here.

01:15:03.411 --> 01:15:04.776
Stand up.

01:15:44.919 --> 01:15:47.581
Offer the blood for your son's life.

01:16:16.384 --> 01:16:17.874
- Here's one.
- Another one?

01:16:18.019 --> 01:16:21.147
This kid runs home from school
with a brown package under his arm.

01:16:21.222 --> 01:16:23.315
He says, "Mom, look what I found..."

01:16:23.391 --> 01:16:24.949
Hold on a second.

01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:27.819
Detective Connolly. 2-7 squad.

01:16:27.896 --> 01:16:30.729
<i>This is Dr. Jamison. Lt. Mc Taggert, please.</i>

01:16:30.799 --> 01:16:33.768
Sorry, Doctor. He's out sick.
The flu's making its rounds.

01:16:33.968 --> 01:16:35.697
I'll call his home. Thanks.

01:17:02.197 --> 01:17:03.687
Why don't you come with us?

01:17:03.832 --> 01:17:04.821
I am.

01:17:05.367 --> 01:17:07.267
I mean to Santa Fe, too.

01:17:08.336 --> 01:17:10.236
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:17:11.706 --> 01:17:13.799
This could get serious, you know?

01:17:14.309 --> 01:17:15.640
I hope so.

01:18:13.868 --> 01:18:15.392
<i>- Hello?
- It's Cal.</i>

01:18:15.470 --> 01:18:18.234
<i>- Darling, how are you?
- I'm fine. How are you?</i>

01:18:18.339 --> 01:18:20.034
<i>- Just great.
- How's the weather?</i>

01:18:20.141 --> 01:18:22.507
It's fabulous,
and the forecast is even better.

01:18:22.577 --> 01:18:24.636
<i>Great. Is Chris behaving himself?</i>

01:18:24.879 --> 01:18:29.111
He's a delight. I'd forgotten about
8-year-olds. He's run me half ragged.

01:18:29.184 --> 01:18:31.982
<i>I know. I guess I'm used to it.
Can I talk to him?</i>

01:18:32.153 --> 01:18:35.486
He's out in the boat with Dennis right now.

01:18:35.723 --> 01:18:38.556
<i>- I'll give him a big hug.
- Please do that for me.</i>

01:18:38.893 --> 01:18:41.259
<i>- Will we see you here this evening?
- Of course.</i>

01:18:41.329 --> 01:18:44.196
That's wonderful.
We have the whole weekend planned.

01:18:44.399 --> 01:18:47.835
<i>- We're looking forward to it.
- All right. See you later, dear.</i>

01:18:47.902 --> 01:18:49.927
<i>- See you later.
- Drive carefully.</i>

01:18:50.004 --> 01:18:51.528
<i>- We will.
- Kisses.</i>

01:18:51.973 --> 01:18:53.668
<i>- Bye-bye.
- Bye.</i>

01:19:03.418 --> 01:19:04.749
You all right?

01:19:04.819 --> 01:19:07.811
<i>I'm okay, just really tired.</i>

01:19:08.323 --> 01:19:10.382
You don't sound okay. I'm coming over.

01:19:10.825 --> 01:19:15.023
No. Really.
I just think I need some more sleep.

01:19:15.263 --> 01:19:18.426
<i>I can call Kate and Dennis
and say we'll be out in the morning.</i>

01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:20.932
<i>- No, go ahead.
- You sure?</i>

01:19:21.002 --> 01:19:23.436
Yes. Call me when you get there.

01:19:24.539 --> 01:19:26.336
Give Chris my love.

01:19:26.941 --> 01:19:29.239
<i>Okay, I will. Take care.</i>

01:19:30.111 --> 01:19:31.703
<i>- Bye.
- Bye.</i>

01:19:35.116 --> 01:19:36.515
Cal?

01:19:49.097 --> 01:19:50.496
Shit.

01:19:54.469 --> 01:19:58.803
<i>No one's here right now,
but if you leave your name and...</i>

01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:00.337
Hello.

01:20:01.242 --> 01:20:03.574
<i>- Who is this?
- It's Mc Taggert.</i>

01:20:03.645 --> 01:20:06.443
<i>- Lieutenant.
- My apartment. Got to see you.</i>

01:20:06.514 --> 01:20:09.711
<i>- What's wrong?
- Just get over here! Do it!</i>

01:20:09.784 --> 01:20:11.217
Wait a second.

01:20:47.522 --> 01:20:48.955
McTaggert?

01:20:59.934 --> 01:21:01.458
Who is it?

01:21:01.903 --> 01:21:03.029
It's me, Cal.

01:21:04.339 --> 01:21:05.567
Shut the door.

01:21:18.186 --> 01:21:20.746
Step into the light.
I want to see your face.

01:21:28.963 --> 01:21:31.329
What's going on? You don't need the gun.

01:21:31.633 --> 01:21:33.157
Like hell I don't.

01:21:33.534 --> 01:21:36.162
I saw them. They're out there.

01:21:36.337 --> 01:21:38.271
There's nobody out there.

01:21:38.539 --> 01:21:40.598
You goddamn liar!

01:21:41.542 --> 01:21:43.339
No, Sean, I swear to you.

01:21:43.978 --> 01:21:46.139
I came alone. I'm here to help you.

01:21:48.716 --> 01:21:50.047
Open that.

01:21:59.661 --> 01:22:00.992
What is it?

01:22:01.262 --> 01:22:02.820
Calder's son.

01:22:03.364 --> 01:22:06.731
It wasn't an overdose.
He killed his own fucking son.

01:22:10.672 --> 01:22:12.401
Where did you get this?

01:22:12.473 --> 01:22:13.838
Buried files.

01:22:14.175 --> 01:22:17.406
They didn't think I knew
where to find them, but I did.

01:22:17.745 --> 01:22:20.009
They're out there now, watching.

01:22:25.219 --> 01:22:26.379
Go on.

01:22:28.523 --> 01:22:29.581
You answer it.

01:22:40.568 --> 01:22:41.557
Hello.

01:22:43.805 --> 01:22:46.103
See? You believe me now?

01:22:48.743 --> 01:22:50.802
Why haven't they done anything to you?

01:22:53.081 --> 01:22:55.072
What have they done to you?

01:22:58.219 --> 01:22:59.709
I can't move.

01:23:16.337 --> 01:23:19.170
"My God, I am heartily sorry...

01:23:19.507 --> 01:23:21.475
"...for having offended Thee.

01:23:22.577 --> 01:23:24.169
"And I detest...

01:23:24.679 --> 01:23:26.306
"...all my sins...

01:23:26.581 --> 01:23:29.209
"...because of Thy just punishments.

01:23:29.984 --> 01:23:34.114
"But most of all because they offend Thee,
my God...

01:23:34.188 --> 01:23:39.182
"...who art all good,
and worthy of all my love.

01:23:40.194 --> 01:23:42.321
"I firmly resolve..."

01:23:45.733 --> 01:23:48.167
Everything's going to be all right now.

01:23:51.272 --> 01:23:52.762
Take the gun.

01:23:53.141 --> 01:23:54.506
Kill him.

01:23:56.310 --> 01:23:58.301
The police won't help you.

01:23:58.780 --> 01:24:00.645
He'll get to anybody.

01:24:03.518 --> 01:24:05.918
Do it yourself, please, I'm begging you.

01:24:05.987 --> 01:24:06.976
Go.

01:24:07.421 --> 01:24:08.410
Okay.

01:24:16.831 --> 01:24:18.822
Destroy Calder.

01:24:20.301 --> 01:24:21.962
God help you.

01:24:42.056 --> 01:24:43.956
"I firmly resolve...

01:24:44.025 --> 01:24:47.426
"...with the help of Thy grace,
to sin no more."

01:26:41.342 --> 01:26:42.570
<i>Yeah, hello.</i>

01:26:42.643 --> 01:26:46.511
Marty, I've got something important
I want you to keep for me.

01:26:46.647 --> 01:26:48.547
<i>Sure. You okay?</i>

01:26:51.419 --> 01:26:52.681
Jessica!

01:26:52.753 --> 01:26:54.414
I'll call you right back!

01:27:23.417 --> 01:27:26.614
- Vital signs?
- BP: 80 over 60. Pulse: 140.

01:27:26.687 --> 01:27:28.655
Respiration: 30 and shallow.

01:27:29.724 --> 01:27:31.385
Wait outside, please.

01:27:46.907 --> 01:27:48.841
<i>There's no one here to take your call.</i>

01:27:48.909 --> 01:27:51.878
<i>But if you leave your name and number,
I'll get back to you.</i>

01:27:51.946 --> 01:27:53.777
<i>Please speak after the beep.</i>

01:27:55.049 --> 01:27:56.676
<i>It's Kate.</i>

01:27:56.784 --> 01:27:59.378
<i>If you hear this, do not call me.</i>

01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:01.620
<i>Change of plans.</i>

01:28:02.957 --> 01:28:05.118
Please, God, what have I done?

01:28:05.192 --> 01:28:07.752
Cal, I'm bringing Chris.

01:28:08.796 --> 01:28:10.855
Will explain all when I see you.

01:28:11.265 --> 01:28:13.790
Meet me, Flanders Inn...

01:28:14.869 --> 01:28:16.131
Hello?

01:28:27.648 --> 01:28:29.912
<i>Marty, make sure they take care of her
till I get back.</i>

01:28:29.984 --> 01:28:31.713
<i>I will! She's covered.</i>

01:28:31.886 --> 01:28:35.788
<i>I told everyone at the hospital
I'm a lawyer. They're not idiots. Relax.</i>

01:28:38.993 --> 01:28:40.654
Get some sleep.

01:29:17.064 --> 01:29:19.464
- Can you find your way back?
- No problem.

01:29:29.477 --> 01:29:31.138
Keep this for me.

01:29:32.046 --> 01:29:34.606
Thanks for everything. I'll see you.

01:29:41.088 --> 01:29:42.919
The prodigal son returns!

01:29:42.990 --> 01:29:46.050
- Hey, guys, I'm sorry.
- Not a word of it. Come in.

01:29:46.127 --> 01:29:50.461
Kate's gone to her all-night market.
She never thinks we have enough food.

01:30:12.786 --> 01:30:14.777
- Last door on the end.
- Okay.

01:30:43.050 --> 01:30:45.382
- Thank you, Dennis.
- Not at all.

01:30:50.090 --> 01:30:53.150
- Hell of a week for you.
- A hell of a year.

01:30:53.727 --> 01:30:56.218
That's true. It is hell, isn't it?

01:30:56.764 --> 01:30:58.561
There's no point in denying it.

01:30:58.799 --> 01:31:02.235
The kind of loss you suffered,
the grief, it's dreadful.

01:31:03.070 --> 01:31:07.268
But what can you do? Be a man about it.
That's what you've done.

01:31:07.608 --> 01:31:09.235
You just go on!

01:31:09.843 --> 01:31:11.834
And then one day...

01:31:12.479 --> 01:31:15.277
...you wake up
and it's just the slightest bit better.

01:31:16.150 --> 01:31:19.017
That's the way it changes, little by little...

01:31:19.253 --> 01:31:21.016
...small increments.

01:31:21.822 --> 01:31:23.687
That's the way it was with us.

01:31:23.757 --> 01:31:26.351
We thought we'd never get over it.
But you do.

01:31:26.694 --> 01:31:27.820
When was that?

01:31:28.362 --> 01:31:31.456
Kate's fieldwork. Post-graduate.
Summer of '46.

01:31:31.999 --> 01:31:34.661
The Sudan. 11 months in the bush.

01:31:35.502 --> 01:31:37.493
Haven't I ever told you this story?

01:31:38.339 --> 01:31:39.328
No.

01:31:40.874 --> 01:31:42.842
Worst drought in 50 years.

01:31:43.143 --> 01:31:44.508
Then cholera.

01:31:44.712 --> 01:31:47.272
We saw half the tribe decimated.

01:31:48.649 --> 01:31:50.617
Daniel was only 4 years old.

01:31:50.884 --> 01:31:54.149
I'd argued against bringing him,
but Kate insisted.

01:31:54.455 --> 01:31:57.049
She couldn't bear to leave him that long.

01:31:57.758 --> 01:31:59.817
Then, when Daniel took sick...

01:32:00.094 --> 01:32:02.392
...the elders of the tribe came to see us.

01:32:02.463 --> 01:32:05.899
We'd developed a trust with them by then.
A bond.

01:32:06.767 --> 01:32:11.033
What they suggested seemed unthinkable,
against nature.

01:32:11.405 --> 01:32:12.895
But you see...

01:32:13.841 --> 01:32:15.103
...Daniel...

01:32:15.976 --> 01:32:19.173
...was so clearly beyond any medical help...

01:32:20.648 --> 01:32:23.208
...and as outsiders, it was a great honor.

01:32:24.618 --> 01:32:26.449
Daniel was very brave.

01:32:26.720 --> 01:32:29.951
And the drought did end.
We were delivered.

01:32:31.125 --> 01:32:33.320
The life of another child was saved.

01:32:34.094 --> 01:32:36.619
A most remarkable child.

01:32:37.765 --> 01:32:41.633
Over the years, he's grown so special
to us, almost like a son.

01:32:42.469 --> 01:32:44.266
He's taught us so much.

01:32:49.777 --> 01:32:54.714
Of course, you're uncertain, naturally.
So was I until I met him.

01:32:55.649 --> 01:32:57.310
Now imagine, if you can...

01:32:58.152 --> 01:33:00.120
...a life without uncertainty.

01:33:00.354 --> 01:33:03.482
Freedom from doubt.
The ability to choose.

01:33:03.924 --> 01:33:05.516
Single-mindedness.

01:33:05.859 --> 01:33:08.760
One life from each of us is all he asks.

01:33:08.962 --> 01:33:12.022
He rewards our devotion a thousandfold.

01:33:12.333 --> 01:33:15.598
Personal desires?
Yes, of course. Anything.

01:33:15.969 --> 01:33:18.460
- That's part of it.
- It's only the beginning.

01:33:18.639 --> 01:33:23.508
There was a time when man was at one
with the gods, before the Fall.

01:33:24.144 --> 01:33:28.308
Now we're at one again
and their benediction is power.

01:33:29.149 --> 01:33:31.640
It's a power you can't imagine.

01:33:32.553 --> 01:33:35.488
Power to create a world of our choosing.

01:33:36.757 --> 01:33:39.317
Power to destroy those who oppose us.

01:33:39.560 --> 01:33:41.050
Chris was chosen.

01:33:41.829 --> 01:33:45.162
When he found the shell, remember?
It was a sign.

01:33:49.403 --> 01:33:51.132
We want you to join us!

01:35:27.801 --> 01:35:29.462
It must be the father.

01:37:13.607 --> 01:37:15.700
"We consecrate this ground...

01:37:16.543 --> 01:37:18.670
"...with this father's humble offering.

01:37:19.546 --> 01:37:21.741
"We seek the strength and wisdom...

01:37:22.082 --> 01:37:24.016
"...of our benefactors.

01:37:24.484 --> 01:37:27.351
"We call upon the ancient gods
to renew our strength.

01:37:28.355 --> 01:37:32.155
"Guide your hand to strike down
the enemies of our faith and this nation.

01:37:32.292 --> 01:37:34.783
"We welcome our brother, Cal...

01:37:35.596 --> 01:37:37.928
"...reborn into your grace.

01:37:40.100 --> 01:37:42.261
"Restore nature's order.

01:37:45.439 --> 01:37:48.203
"The power, which is our birthright.

01:37:49.443 --> 01:37:52.105
"The glory, which is our destiny.

01:37:54.114 --> 01:37:58.107
"Our enemies consumed by rings of fire.

01:38:00.287 --> 01:38:02.619
"Our strength reborn...

01:38:02.956 --> 01:38:04.287
"...in sacrifice!"

01:39:40.887 --> 01:39:42.184
Do you believe?

01:39:47.861 --> 01:39:50.421
Yes, I do believe.

01:40:17.591 --> 01:40:18.785
Dad?

01:40:21.027 --> 01:40:24.724
"Peter, Peter, pumpkin eater
Had a wife and couldn't keep her..."

01:40:24.798 --> 01:40:27.289
- You okay?
- I'm all right! Where is he?

01:40:27.367 --> 01:40:30.268
Fucking maniacs! Who are these guys?

01:40:30.904 --> 01:40:33.464
They jumped in the elevator.
They took him up.

01:40:35.876 --> 01:40:37.503
I'll take this one.

01:40:46.052 --> 01:40:47.041
Dad!

01:40:55.395 --> 01:40:56.726
Let me go!

01:40:58.431 --> 01:40:59.989
Goddamn.

01:42:05.065 --> 01:42:06.965
God gave His only begotten son.

01:42:07.067 --> 01:42:08.466
Let him go!

01:42:09.169 --> 01:42:10.693
Remember that?

01:42:11.204 --> 01:42:13.798
It is God's will
that innocence redeem the world.

01:42:14.374 --> 01:42:16.968
We give our sons to war
in the name of peace!

01:42:17.043 --> 01:42:21.742
Sacrifice our families to false gods,
ambition, lust, pride!

01:42:22.449 --> 01:42:24.883
It's hypocrisy! This is all lies.

01:42:25.352 --> 01:42:29.686
I was a slave, I had no life!
You have no life! God gives you life!

01:42:30.323 --> 01:42:32.154
You give them innocence...

01:42:32.893 --> 01:42:34.884
...the gods give you life.

01:42:35.929 --> 01:42:38.363
And your son was innocent, wasn't he?

01:42:39.132 --> 01:42:41.794
Peter, that was your son's name, wasn't it?

01:42:44.237 --> 01:42:47.229
And you sacrificed your son
to the gods, didn't you?

01:42:50.577 --> 01:42:52.568
That was my salvation.

01:42:53.446 --> 01:42:54.936
I was reborn.

01:42:55.715 --> 01:42:59.549
It must have taken great strength
and great courage.

01:43:00.820 --> 01:43:01.980
Tell me.

01:43:05.592 --> 01:43:07.082
He looked into my eyes.

01:43:11.364 --> 01:43:13.025
He forgave me...

01:43:13.934 --> 01:43:14.923
...Peter.

01:43:18.138 --> 01:43:19.628
He understood.

01:44:59.572 --> 01:45:01.062
I'm over here.

01:45:01.808 --> 01:45:02.797
Come to me.

01:45:04.377 --> 01:45:05.366
No.

01:45:07.747 --> 01:45:09.578
You come to me.

01:46:29.195 --> 01:46:30.492
Let's go, boy.

01:46:36.736 --> 01:46:38.226
Hey Bean, how's it going?

01:46:38.338 --> 01:46:41.136
- Hey, Dad. Got the barbecue sauce?
- Sure do.

01:46:41.274 --> 01:46:43.265
Let's go easy on it this time.

01:46:44.611 --> 01:46:46.704
Don't you look beautiful.

01:46:48.248 --> 01:46:50.011
- I'm glad you're home.
- Me, too.

01:46:50.083 --> 01:46:52.745
- Be careful with that, Chris.
- All right, Mom.

01:47:13.540 --> 01:47:14.802
It'll keep.

01:47:18.645 --> 01:47:20.203
Maybe it won't!

01:47:25.618 --> 01:47:28.610
Chris, that looks terrific.
You don't need my help at all.

01:47:51.044 --> 01:47:52.477
What is it, boy?

01:47:53.079 --> 01:47:54.410
Easy!

01:48:17.570 --> 01:48:19.231
What's wrong, boy?

01:48:21.007 --> 01:48:22.565
Anybody up there?

01:48:23.710 --> 01:48:25.143
All right, out!

01:49:05.118 --> 01:49:08.212
I did it for us.

01:49:12.892 --> 01:49:14.723
We'll be safe now.
