00:46.713 --> 00:50.007
<i>Give me audio on that,
please.</i>

00:51.217 --> 00:54.050
<i>Right turn on Royal.</i>

00:54.154 --> 00:57.123
<i>Can you zoom in?
All right. Now pan right.</i>

00:57.223 --> 01:01.319
<i>Yes, that's affirmative.
Male, late 30s.</i>

01:01.428 --> 01:03.988
<i> Group of six males, Quadrant 9.</i>
<i>Give me the middle one.</i>

01:04.096 --> 01:05.758
<i>N.G. Not a match.</i>

01:05.865 --> 01:08.425
<i>Agent 4-86, squawk and ident.
Need your position.</i>

01:08.535 --> 01:10.799
<i>Camera's on Decatur,
now online.</i>

01:10.904 --> 01:12.337
<i>I'm heading north on Clinton.</i>

01:12.439 --> 01:14.669
<i>Let's get a sweep moving
southeast on Toulouse.</i>

01:14.774 --> 01:17.800
<i>Strike that.</i>
<i>On Conti- 800 block.</i>

01:18.912 --> 01:21.938
<i>I'm going to change position.</i>

01:22.048 --> 01:24.448
<i>- Two out of five, no good.</i>
<i>- That's no good.</i>

01:24.551 --> 01:27.145
<i>Come back around on Exchange</i>
<i>and head north.</i>

01:27.253 --> 01:29.448
<i>I'm moving onto
Burgundy Street now.</i>

01:29.556 --> 01:32.252
<i>It's got some dropouts on the feed there.</i>

01:32.358 --> 01:34.553
<i>Possible target heading
northeast on Bourbon.</i>

01:34.661 --> 01:36.629
<i>Fifty yards from St. Louis.</i>

01:36.729 --> 01:39.960
<i> Southwest corner.</i>
<i>Target is wearing a red shirt and shoulder bag.</i>

01:40.066 --> 01:43.365
<i> I see the target.</i>
<i>I'm too far out for a facial lock.</i>

01:43.470 --> 01:47.634
<i>I've got him. Red shirt.</i>

01:47.740 --> 01:50.106
<i>No good. Face is turned.</i>

01:50.210 --> 01:52.371
<i>Static camera missed him too.</i>

01:52.479 --> 01:56.779
<i> Gator's got eyes on him.</i>
<i>I'm heading back around the perimeter.</i>

01:56.883 --> 02:00.148
<i>Gator, he's a 120 yards
ahead to the left.</i>

02:00.253 --> 02:02.278
<i>I'm right behind him.</i>

02:02.388 --> 02:04.379
Looks real close.

02:04.491 --> 02:06.516
Can't get a clear shot.

02:06.626 --> 02:10.323
<i> He's coming up on your left.</i>
<i>Suspect in red continuing on Conti Street.</i>

02:10.430 --> 02:13.797
<i>Rabbit got him. Full face.</i>

02:13.900 --> 02:15.800
Give me a sec.

02:18.771 --> 02:20.739
Beginning scan.

02:24.677 --> 02:26.406
Negative. It's not a match.

02:26.513 --> 02:28.378
Okay, Bulldog, take the northwest quad.

02:28.481 --> 02:30.813
<i>Gator, hold firm, cover that east bank.</i>

02:32.252 --> 02:35.244
Samuel's in position?

02:35.355 --> 02:37.152
We're just waiting on Miles, sir.

02:37.257 --> 02:39.691
<i> Need a whole new sweep</i>
<i>of the area starting in Quad 1.</i>

02:39.792 --> 02:43.455
<i>Let's get all bank "A"cameras online.</i>

02:43.696 --> 02:47.291
<i>Danny?
You're not feeding the dog, are you?</i>

02:47.400 --> 02:49.368
<i>No. I'm looking for my badge.</i>

02:49.469 --> 02:52.529
They give you two things when you're a cop-
a gun and a badge.

02:52.639 --> 02:56.040
I have one.
I can't find my badge.

02:56.142 --> 02:59.202
- It's on the thingy.
- The thing, the thing?

02:59.312 --> 03:02.338
I was just over by the thing.
It's not there.

03:02.448 --> 03:04.780
Shortie, remember our plan.
You're gonna stay strong, I'm gonna give you food.

03:04.884 --> 03:07.079
Just don't tell Mom
I gave you that, all right?

03:07.187 --> 03:10.782
Daniel Fisher. Hmm?

03:10.890 --> 03:13.017
I'm tryin' to build
the world's most dominant pug.

03:13.126 --> 03:15.390
He's going through a bulking phase.
Look at him.

03:15.495 --> 03:18.191
Come here, Shortie.
Come on. Daddy's bad.

03:18.298 --> 03:20.528
Come here.
I'll show you the thingy.

03:20.633 --> 03:22.225
The thing.
"It's by the thing."

03:22.335 --> 03:24.633
<i>I was just by the thing.</i>
<i>It's not there.</i>

03:24.737 --> 03:27.228
- I was just-
- The thingy.

03:27.340 --> 03:29.274
- This is the thing.
- Yeah.

03:29.375 --> 03:31.741
- I didn't know you meant that thing.
- Course not.

03:31.844 --> 03:36.110
<i>It's here. You know,</i>
<i>I still got, like, 10 minutes.</i>

03:36.216 --> 03:38.309
Yeah? It only takes you two, honey.
Come on.

03:38.418 --> 03:41.546
I think it's a strong two.

03:46.226 --> 03:49.957
Go to work.
Be safe, okay?

03:51.397 --> 03:54.628
Okay. Go.

03:54.734 --> 03:56.429
Love you, Shortie.

03:58.004 --> 04:00.734
- Hey, Hank!
- Hey, Molly!

04:00.840 --> 04:03.673
Come on.

04:03.776 --> 04:07.940
Aw, shit. I am definitely not smarter
than a fifth grader.

04:10.917 --> 04:12.817
<i>Do you need backup?</i>

04:12.919 --> 04:14.819
Hey, man. What's going on?

04:14.921 --> 04:18.618
So you, uh-you gotta get permission from
the old lady and the dog now to come to work?

04:18.725 --> 04:22.456
Just the dog.

04:22.562 --> 04:24.928
<i>Hey, homework.</i>

04:25.031 --> 04:27.124
F.B.I.'s tracking this guy through the Quarter.
They need some hand-holding.

04:32.572 --> 04:34.472
Coming out of the hotel.

04:34.574 --> 04:36.269
<i>Target matches four out of five points.</i>

04:36.376 --> 04:38.207
Gator's on Royal, 200 block.

04:38.311 --> 04:42.008
All available agents, scramble.
We need a clear lock. Get audio in place.

04:42.115 --> 04:45.016
He's moving towards Bourbon.
I'm 50 yards back.

04:45.118 --> 04:48.986
<i>Come on, people.</i>
<i>I can't afford to lose this guy again.</i>

04:49.088 --> 04:51.022
<i>I'm in position,</i>
<i>target heading towards me.</i>

04:51.124 --> 04:53.024
<i>Clear shot.</i>

04:56.596 --> 04:58.655
Hold position.

04:58.765 --> 05:00.494
- Sir, the locals need-
- Shut up!

05:00.600 --> 05:02.568
Show me that Irish bastard.

05:14.580 --> 05:17.310
Confirmed. All teams,
we have a positive I.D. on Miles Jackson.

05:17.417 --> 05:20.318
<i>You want to see the face of the devil?</i>
<i>There it is.</i>

05:20.420 --> 05:24.618
<i>Brought down Trans Atlantic Flight 212.</i>
<i>Bombed the American Embassy in Frankfurt.</i>

05:24.724 --> 05:28.182
The man decapitated his own brother
for blowing a deal in Tangiers.

05:28.294 --> 05:30.421
It's game day, people.
Let's go.

05:30.530 --> 05:32.555
Got him.

05:34.767 --> 05:37.895
- He's got his cell phone out now.
- Sir, he's making the call.

05:41.674 --> 05:43.733
Hey, open up Samuel's feed.

05:43.843 --> 05:45.572
It's an incoming call, sir.
Still encrypted.

05:47.480 --> 05:51.246
Fifteen minutes.
The abandoned wharf on Permission Way.

05:51.351 --> 05:53.876
Miles is bringing the weapons,
and we're making the exchange.

05:56.622 --> 05:58.920
<i> I got three tapped cameras,</i>
<i>including the harbor crane.</i>

05:59.025 --> 06:02.017
- I need Team 1 to get me set up inside.
- Samuel, remember our deal.

06:02.128 --> 06:05.359
You ever want to see your brother again,
you do as I say when I say it.

06:05.465 --> 06:08.866
We get Miles, we get the weapons,
you and Joshua get your freedom.

06:08.968 --> 06:11.232
<i>- Clear?</i>
<i>- Claro.</i>

06:12.638 --> 06:13.764
Now we dance.

06:17.877 --> 06:21.040
- No! Hey, hey. No, no, no, no, no.
- Hang on. He stopped.

06:21.147 --> 06:24.605
Let's see.
He takes your bishop knight to c4...

06:24.717 --> 06:26.617
pawn to a7, rook to block.

06:26.719 --> 06:29.882
He takes your queen.
It's all over but the crying.

06:29.989 --> 06:33.550
Try, uh, pawn to a6.
It's better.

06:35.495 --> 06:37.395
He's heading east.

06:40.933 --> 06:42.730
<i>He's hailing a cab.</i>

06:42.835 --> 06:45.827
Mobile Unit 6 has video on him,
hundred yards back.

06:45.938 --> 06:48.805
<i>Send N.O.P.D. the new pics on Miles.</i>

06:48.908 --> 06:51.877
Have them establish
a 10-block perimeter around the wharf.

06:51.978 --> 06:55.175
- Sir, should you call the director?
- No.

06:55.281 --> 06:58.182
This is the first time Miles has been
out in the open in two years.

06:58.284 --> 07:00.385
The director has no idea
you're about to cut a deal.

07:00.386 --> 07:00.980
There is no deal.

07:01.087 --> 07:04.113
We use Samuel and Joshua to get to Miles.
We bring 'em all down.

07:04.223 --> 07:08.751
Nobody's going anywhere, Ray.
This time, he's not getting away from me.

07:11.864 --> 07:16.096
Just give me the scoop, man.
So, you gonna pop the question, or what?

07:16.202 --> 07:19.330
I'm just saying, you know, you move in
with the lady, the ring usually comes next.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.873
Bro, it's been two weeks.

07:21.974 --> 07:25.307
- And?
- Yeah, you've lived with, like, 14 different girls.

07:25.411 --> 07:29.211
Why, yes, I did. But I'm sexier than you.

07:29.315 --> 07:31.681
I mean, if a freakishly large man
such as yourself...

07:31.784 --> 07:34.981
is gonna keep a fine woman like Molly,
you're gonna have to put her in cuffs.

07:46.766 --> 07:48.563
E.T.A: two minutes.
Cameras are up inside the wharf.

08:15.461 --> 08:17.361
<i>Punctual, Sam. I like that.</i>

08:17.463 --> 08:20.432
<i>- We got audio now. Reading five by five.</i>
- Okay, we're in first position.

08:20.533 --> 08:22.558
All teams, on my mark.

08:22.668 --> 08:27.105
We get Miles to lead us to the location
of the guns, we proceed with extract.

08:28.875 --> 08:33.244
Okay, so... this is how
this rodeo is gonna work.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.712
<i>You give me the briefcase...</i>

08:35.815 --> 08:39.182
I give you the P.D.A.
with the coordinates to the weapons.

08:39.284 --> 08:42.277
- It's all very simple.
- No.

08:44.056 --> 08:46.547
I can't do this.

08:46.659 --> 08:49.457
Don't you do this, you son of a bitch.

08:49.562 --> 08:51.792
You can't do what?

08:51.898 --> 08:54.560
I set you up.

08:59.171 --> 09:03.301
<i>The F.B.I. knows you're here.</i>
<i>They're watching us right now.</i>

09:03.409 --> 09:05.707
They-They know you're here.

09:06.979 --> 09:09.641
And now I'm never gonna
see my brother again.

09:20.326 --> 09:22.760
Half an hour, Lake Pontchartrain Causeway.

09:22.862 --> 09:25.057
You bring me my brother,
I'll bring you Miles.

09:25.164 --> 09:27.428
That is, of course,
if he makes it that long.

09:40.279 --> 09:42.679
- Holy shit.
- Hey, let's move.

09:42.782 --> 09:44.764
Get me an outside feed.
Give me the outside feeds!

09:44.765 --> 09:45.114
You got it.

10:16.749 --> 10:19.398
Sir, we need to stop 'em
before they get to the bridge.

10:19.399 --> 10:20.344
Get me a 20 on Joshua.

10:20.453 --> 10:22.944
- Samuel is gonna try to get his brother.
- You want to make a deal?

10:23.055 --> 10:24.955
Ray, pick up the phone!

10:28.094 --> 10:31.359
The F.B.I. told us exactly where
they were positioned. Go around.

10:31.464 --> 10:33.364
<i>Okay.</i>

10:34.934 --> 10:37.300
You all right?

10:41.273 --> 10:43.571
It's gonna bruise like a bitch.

10:48.280 --> 10:50.714
You're lucky I didn't aim any lower.

10:50.816 --> 10:53.011
Man, it's just like those pansy-ass feds.

10:53.119 --> 10:55.644
I mean, they call us, we jump right away.

10:55.755 --> 10:59.816
<i>We call them, city's under seven feet of water-</i>
<i>Hey, five days. Take it easy.</i>

10:59.925 --> 11:02.189
Those guys skin my ass, Danny,
they really do.

11:02.294 --> 11:05.923
Look at this guy-
arms trafficking, espionage, murder.

11:06.032 --> 11:08.728
Hell, he even sold two dirty bombs
in Paris last year.

11:08.834 --> 11:10.392
Interpol says he's got
two more on the market.

11:10.503 --> 11:13.165
Like the city needs more to deal with?

11:13.272 --> 11:16.537
I mean, really, why can't they take that crap
someplace else- Kansas, Iowa?

11:16.642 --> 11:19.008
Helsinki.

11:19.111 --> 11:22.342
<i> All units, we're at black.</i>
<i>F.B.I. requests assistance.</i>

11:22.448 --> 11:24.143
<i>Sending target information.</i>

11:24.250 --> 11:26.343
<i>Eight male suspects, three vehicles</i>
<i>heading to Lake Pontchartrain Causeway.</i>

11:26.452 --> 11:29.910
- Sounds like the feds dropped the ball again.
- Surprised?

11:41.167 --> 11:44.796
Someone broke into the safe house.
They took Joshua and killed our agents.

11:44.904 --> 11:47.202
- He did it again.
- How do you want to proceed with the convoy?

11:49.075 --> 11:50.702
Well, take 'em!

11:50.810 --> 11:51.435
Take 'em.

11:57.582 --> 12:01.609
I threw in an extra five percent,
for treating my brother and I so well.

12:03.054 --> 12:05.079
- Was it any trouble getting him out?
- For me?

12:05.190 --> 12:10.628
Nah. For the two guards
I had to kill, maybe.

12:10.729 --> 12:13.289
- And he's waiting at the airfield?
- Yeah, he's there right now.

12:13.398 --> 12:15.662
Why don't you give him a call?

12:17.269 --> 12:19.669
<i>You know what the funny thing is, Sam?</i>

12:19.771 --> 12:21.932
If I hadn't have found out the F.B.I.
was holding your brother...

12:22.040 --> 12:23.940
<i>as a bargaining chip to catch me...</i>

12:24.042 --> 12:27.409
<i>you'd have gone along with this whole
double-cross without so much as a consideration.</i>

12:27.512 --> 12:30.106
And I'd be out of my hard-earned cash.

12:30.215 --> 12:34.481
The F.B.I. would probably
have me in custody...

12:34.586 --> 12:36.486
and you and your douche bag brother...

12:36.588 --> 12:40.024
would be holding hands somewhere
in the south of France.

12:43.528 --> 12:46.156
Yeah? Hello.

12:46.264 --> 12:50.997
I'm sorry. Joshua can't come to the phone
right now, but thanks for the ride.

13:19.213 --> 13:21.204
Oldest trick in the book, Sam.

13:21.315 --> 13:23.306
Turn their heads with one hand...

13:23.417 --> 13:26.648
quietly slip out the back with the other.

13:38.432 --> 13:40.297
Later.

13:47.942 --> 13:51.036
- Right on time, baby.
- Aren't I always?

13:52.413 --> 13:54.074
Mmm!

14:01.455 --> 14:03.821
Show me.

14:10.131 --> 14:14.830
<i>We can finally afford that pony</i>
<i>that you've always wanted.</i>

14:14.936 --> 14:18.929
I'll drive.

14:20.408 --> 14:21.807
- Whoo!
- Right.

14:25.146 --> 14:29.378
<i> F.B.I. update. Suspects in custody,</i>
<i>but Miles Jackson is still at large.</i>

14:29.483 --> 14:32.941
<i>Looking for gray van, Louisiana plates:</i>
<i>Alpha-Golf-November-803.</i>

14:33.054 --> 14:35.682
<i>- Stand by.</i>
- Unit 14 en route for Lower Nine.

14:37.725 --> 14:40.819
Whoa!

14:42.563 --> 14:44.895
Uh, my bad.

14:46.667 --> 14:49.534
<i>I didn't even see that guy.</i>

14:58.613 --> 15:00.547
Turn around.

15:00.648 --> 15:04.209
Turn-What are you talkin' about?
Danny, we're at black. We gotta get over there.

15:04.318 --> 15:06.912
We gotta stop that car.
That's the girl- the girl in the car.

15:07.021 --> 15:09.251
Oh, Jesus. All right.

15:13.327 --> 15:15.295
<i>Headquarters to 5-21.</i>

15:21.502 --> 15:23.094
Pull over, please.

15:32.613 --> 15:35.514
Come on. You heard Dispatch.
We're lookin' for an Irish dude in a gray van.

15:35.616 --> 15:39.108
- You think this is a good idea?
- Just ask her the questions.

15:44.992 --> 15:48.018
Such a waste of time.

15:58.472 --> 16:00.804
License and registration, ma'am.

16:00.908 --> 16:03.433
<i>Evening, Officer. What'd I-</i>
<i>What seems to be the problem?</i>

16:03.544 --> 16:07.275
- Evening. License and registration, please.
- Yeah, of course.

16:08.416 --> 16:11.146
Hope I'm not in any sort of trouble.

16:13.754 --> 16:15.551
How does everything look?

16:17.558 --> 16:20.755
Oh, outstanding.

16:20.861 --> 16:23.989
But tell me, what's a pretty lady like you
doin' drivin' all by herself...

16:24.098 --> 16:26.225
through a neighborhood like this?

16:26.334 --> 16:30.065
Sometimes I like to be alone.
Sometimes I don't.

16:32.907 --> 16:36.070
- Uh, give me a second.
- Yeah. No problem.

16:37.611 --> 16:41.172
Dude, do you wanna see her face?

16:43.851 --> 16:46.649
- Here. Thank you, ma'am.
- Thank you.

16:46.754 --> 16:48.153
<i>Listen...</i>

16:48.255 --> 16:52.248
here's my card, you know,
for those times when you don't.

16:54.962 --> 16:56.930
Ask her to open the trunk.

16:57.031 --> 17:00.114
<i>Come on. I'm working my shit</i>
<i>over here. What are you doing?</i>

17:00.115 --> 17:00.364
Ask her.

17:03.537 --> 17:06.300
I'm gonna need you to pop your trunk.

17:08.608 --> 17:10.372
- Gun!
- Shit!

17:28.796 --> 17:32.596
- This just got interesting.
- I got this.

17:32.833 --> 17:35.199
10-13! Officer down.
You all right, man?

17:35.302 --> 17:37.202
- Oh, yeah.
- Where'd he get you?

17:37.304 --> 17:39.169
- He shot me in my ass.
- In your ass?

17:39.273 --> 17:42.401
- Shut up.
- Keep pressure on it. Three minutes to E.M.S.

17:42.510 --> 17:45.411
<i>- Hey!</i>
- Hang on!

17:45.513 --> 17:48.676
<i>No, Danny.</i>
<i>I know that look!</i>

17:48.783 --> 17:51.308
<i>You wait for backup.</i>
<i>Don't be a cowboy! Danny!</i>

17:54.088 --> 17:56.648
- There's one on foot.
- Left or right?

17:56.757 --> 17:58.918
- I don't know, baby.
- You watch that side, I'll watch this side.

18:00.361 --> 18:02.886
Pursuit on foot.

18:02.997 --> 18:05.761
Parallel to Duquense.
Suspect's in a gold BMW.

18:07.968 --> 18:09.401
There he is.

18:16.944 --> 18:20.277
- Where do I go? What do I do?
- Left on Saint Claude, right on Montmartre.

18:20.381 --> 18:22.372
We cross the bridge.
We get on the jet.

18:22.483 --> 18:25.111
We never see the New Orleans
Police Department again. I promise.

18:37.531 --> 18:39.362
Police business.

18:49.092 --> 18:51.617
Okay. Keep goin'.

19:01.859 --> 19:04.453
Move!

19:09.800 --> 19:12.200
Damn!

19:12.303 --> 19:14.237
Down, boy! Down!

19:28.686 --> 19:31.450
Officer Fisher, still on foot pursuit.

19:31.556 --> 19:33.956
Subject's headed towards the marina.

19:38.429 --> 19:40.590
It's, like, two blocks to the bridge.
Home free.

20:12.296 --> 20:14.093
<i>Erica!</i>

20:27.111 --> 20:29.136
- Move, move, move!
<i>- Freeze!</i>

20:29.246 --> 20:31.510
- Hands in the air now!
<i>- Miles?</i>

20:31.616 --> 20:34.210
- Now!
<i>- Run!</i>

20:36.921 --> 20:38.616
Erica!

20:38.723 --> 20:41.658
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

20:41.759 --> 20:44.523
<i>Stay in the vehicle.</i>
<i>Stay in the vehicle!</i>

20:44.629 --> 20:46.597
<i>Hands up, now!</i>

20:50.234 --> 20:52.168
- Who are you?
- On the ground!

20:53.804 --> 20:56.568
What's your name?

20:58.609 --> 21:00.839
Officer Fisher.

21:06.851 --> 21:09.979
I'll remember you.

21:13.991 --> 21:15.891
On the ground.

21:43.584 --> 21:46.280
I'm tryin' to figure out what's worse, man-

21:46.387 --> 21:48.446
your shootin' at this table
or your shootin' at the range.

21:48.556 --> 21:51.150
Aw, he's got jokes, huh?
I'll take those, Jesse.

21:51.258 --> 21:54.887
Hey, mama, this might be a little strange,
but Danny wants to know if you think I'm sexy.

21:54.995 --> 21:56.553
<i>Huh?</i>

21:56.664 --> 21:58.894
- Really?
- Oh, yeah. Inquiring minds got to know.

21:58.999 --> 22:01.058
<i>Don't worry about him, darling.</i>

22:01.168 --> 22:04.137
- You're safe. We had him neutered.
- See? Safety first.

22:04.238 --> 22:07.366
Ooh, whoo!

22:07.475 --> 22:09.670
You're an animal.

22:09.777 --> 22:11.677
- Hey, a toast.
- Right on.

22:11.779 --> 22:15.408
To my partner.
One year ago tomorrow, we made detective.

22:15.516 --> 22:18.212
<i>Yeah, and all 'cause</i>
<i>of my outstanding police work, huh?</i>

22:18.319 --> 22:20.287
Okay. Maybe it had somethin'
to do with the fact...

22:20.387 --> 22:22.355
that you captured
an international arms dealer.

22:24.625 --> 22:27.685
Hey, but seriously, bro, I mean,
from patrols in the Lower Ninth to this?

22:27.795 --> 22:30.662
- Doesn't ever bother you?
<i>- What?</i>

22:32.199 --> 22:36.226
<i>What- the mandated pay raise,</i>
<i>the flashy new badge?</i>

22:36.337 --> 22:40.000
Benefits of bein' a minor celebrity?
Hell, no!

22:40.107 --> 22:42.632
You just never think about what would
have happened if we had stayed put...

22:42.743 --> 22:44.711
and called for backup that night,
like we were supposed to?

22:44.812 --> 22:48.748
Ah, aside from the fact that I wouldn't
have a bullet hole in my ass cheek?

22:48.849 --> 22:50.840
Yeah, besides that.

22:50.951 --> 22:53.613
No, Danny, not at all. You know what?
Neither should you.

22:53.721 --> 22:56.212
Just sayin'.

22:56.323 --> 22:59.451
A girl dies that night,
and we get promoted.

23:04.031 --> 23:05.931
Can I get a cup?

23:06.033 --> 23:07.933
- That's it?
- I got to.

23:08.035 --> 23:10.731
- Aw, come on. It's fellas' night out. One more.
- We've had like six one mores.

23:10.838 --> 23:15.241
I gotta go home. Why? Because
that beautiful woman, that annoying dog-

23:15.342 --> 23:17.810
you know, they're waitin' for me.

23:17.912 --> 23:21.243
All right, all right.
I can't argue with that, bro.

23:21.244 --> 23:22.076
All right, man.

23:22.183 --> 23:24.083
Good luck.

23:24.185 --> 23:26.449
Aw, come on, son. I don't need luck.
This ain't about luck.

23:48.676 --> 23:51.668
You gotta be kiddin' me.

23:51.779 --> 23:55.613
- This is not a big deal, okay?
- Two inches of water on the floor. Look at Shortie.

23:55.716 --> 23:57.684
I know. Phil's gonna be here
in a few minutes.

23:57.785 --> 24:00.777
That's all I need- put another one
of that guy's kids through college.

24:00.888 --> 24:02.480
This is not a big deal.
This is our home.

24:02.590 --> 24:05.252
Apparently our home is made
of durable papier-mâché.

24:05.253 --> 24:05.855
Stop. Stop it.

24:05.960 --> 24:08.485
Look, I have to go to the hospital.
I'm doin' another night shift.

24:08.596 --> 24:11.793
- I'm putting you and Shortie in charge.
- Fantastic.

24:18.489 --> 24:20.252
We're fucked.

24:23.961 --> 24:26.555
I'm gonna start sleepin'
in the guest room.

24:26.663 --> 24:30.292
<i>There's leftover pork chops. Make sure</i>
<i>you feed Phil when he's done savin' our house.</i>

24:30.401 --> 24:32.369
Love you guys.

24:34.204 --> 24:39.574
<i>Dude, didn't I tell you two months ago</i>
<i>that you had to replace the stop valve?</i>

24:39.676 --> 24:42.770
- What stop valve?
<i>- Look, I told you it had a crack.</i>

24:42.880 --> 24:45.314
You said you'd take care of it yourself,
save a little cash.

24:48.252 --> 24:51.312
- I spent all afternoon underneath that sink.
- I was gonna get to it.

24:51.421 --> 24:54.049
- When? Two months ago?
- That's when I just bought the new car.

24:54.158 --> 24:57.787
- I was tryin' to save some cash.
- I can't handle this. I- I'm gonna be late.

24:57.895 --> 25:00.295
- Molly?
- Danny, what?

25:00.397 --> 25:02.365
Look, I need a little help here, okay?

25:02.466 --> 25:06.835
First it was the gas bill, and then
the air conditioning, and now the sink?

25:06.937 --> 25:10.134
I mean, I love you.

25:10.240 --> 25:14.643
I just- I need to know that I can trust you
with these things. That's all. Okay?

25:14.745 --> 25:17.077
I'm sorry.

25:18.515 --> 25:20.483
I gotta go.

25:22.319 --> 25:24.844
Molly, wait.

25:24.955 --> 25:26.923
Look, I'll see you in the morning, okay?

25:36.166 --> 25:38.691
<i>Dude, sorry.</i>
<i>I didn't mean to make a ruckus.</i>

25:38.802 --> 25:41.669
<i>- But a plumber's gotta plumb.</i>

25:41.772 --> 25:45.105
<i>You want a little advice?</i>

25:45.209 --> 25:47.336
It's the ones that go underneath the sink-

25:47.444 --> 25:49.844
those are the ones that you don't want
to have walk away.

26:06.196 --> 26:08.289
Yeah.

26:08.398 --> 26:11.765
Is this Officer Fisher
of the New Orleans Police Department?

26:13.369 --> 26:15.496
Detective Fisher.
Who's calling?

26:15.605 --> 26:18.096
This is Miles Jackson.

26:18.208 --> 26:21.006
- How you been?
- Why the hell are you calling me?

26:21.111 --> 26:24.137
Say hello-
chat about the weather...

26:24.247 --> 26:26.215
see if you fancy a quick bite.

26:26.316 --> 26:28.284
Yeah, prison food tastes like shit.

26:28.384 --> 26:31.444
Yes, it does.
One of the many reasons that I left.

26:33.923 --> 26:37.290
I put you there, Miles. I'm pretty sure
I'd know if you were out by now.

26:37.393 --> 26:39.258
Really, Danny?

26:39.362 --> 26:43.822
I'm sorry to tell you, but I think you might
have been left out of the loop on this one.

26:43.933 --> 26:45.901
Okay. So, where are you?

26:46.002 --> 26:51.235
Close enough to smell Molly in the shower
while you were takin' your little nap.

26:51.341 --> 26:55.937
It's a real shame about the plumbin',
'cause I was really startin' to enjoy the show.

26:59.282 --> 27:02.183
<i>- Danny? Where you goin'?</i>

27:07.423 --> 27:09.118
I don't know where you are
or what you're doin'.

27:09.225 --> 27:12.735
You come anywhere near me and Molly,
I swear to God-

27:12.736 --> 27:14.060
Danny, please shut up.

27:14.164 --> 27:16.257
You killed the love of my life.

27:16.366 --> 27:18.960
That was an accident, Miles!

27:26.643 --> 27:28.873
Oh, and poor Phil.

27:28.978 --> 27:31.879
He was really looking forward
to those pork chops.

27:31.981 --> 27:34.313
Phil!

27:34.417 --> 27:36.681
Phil, get out of the house!

27:53.269 --> 27:56.204
Now, see, that was an accident.

27:58.341 --> 28:02.141
Okay, you listen
very carefully to me, Danny.

28:02.245 --> 28:04.145
It's our anniversary.

28:04.247 --> 28:08.741
One year ago today, whether by dumb luck
or uncompromising skill, you bested me.

28:08.852 --> 28:11.821
And as such, today we're going
to have our rematch.

28:11.921 --> 28:13.752
I just took Round 1.

28:13.857 --> 28:18.920
The last time we met, you took from me
what can never, ever be replaced.

28:19.028 --> 28:21.519
And for that, I am going to take from you.

28:21.631 --> 28:26.034
Now I just wonder, do you think Molly
is gonna be able to trust me?

28:27.237 --> 28:29.330
Miles! Miles!

28:34.010 --> 28:36.103
- Keep him safe.
- All right.

29:02.138 --> 29:05.130
Excuse me. Could I just use your phone?
I need to call my daughter.

29:05.241 --> 29:07.106
- Yeah, of course.
- Thank you.

29:07.210 --> 29:08.643
Great.

29:12.515 --> 29:15.746
From her house.

29:26.229 --> 29:28.424
Okay. Um-

29:41.110 --> 29:43.305
Molly!

29:43.413 --> 29:45.313
How about Camille's mom?

29:48.084 --> 29:50.052
Molly!

30:01.397 --> 30:03.365
- Police! Out of the car!
- What?

30:03.466 --> 30:05.434
- Out of the car. Come on.
- Okay.

30:14.377 --> 30:16.504
Hey!

30:32.462 --> 30:34.327
Hey, watch it!

30:59.655 --> 31:02.715
- That's great!
- Yeah, no problem.

31:10.466 --> 31:12.764
- Holla at your boy.
- Hank.

31:12.869 --> 31:15.429
Call D.O.T. Have them stall
the <i>Thomas Jefferson</i> ferry.

31:15.538 --> 31:18.033
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's going on, Danny? Slow down.

31:18.034 --> 31:18.598
Miles Jackson.

31:18.708 --> 31:22.576
He broke out of prison. If we don't stop
that ferry in the next 30 seconds...

31:22.678 --> 31:26.273
- I'll never see Molly again.
- All right, all right. D.O.T. I'm on it.

31:35.124 --> 31:37.684
Did you get good grades?

31:39.195 --> 31:41.220
Try to get some of your homework done
while you're there.

32:05.354 --> 32:08.152
- Bye-bye. Thank you so much.
- Hey, no problem.

32:08.257 --> 32:10.384
- Sorry it took a little longer.
- No. Don't worry.

32:33.749 --> 32:36.980
<i>Molly. Molly, pick up!</i>

32:38.588 --> 32:41.079
Whoa, whoa! Detective Danny Fisher.
Secure this area now.

32:43.392 --> 32:45.792
Ladies and gentlemen, hold it!
Stop for a minute.

32:49.031 --> 32:52.762
Danny.

32:52.869 --> 32:53.335
Where is she?

32:53.336 --> 32:55.235
She's gone. She just gets
on the ferry and she's gone.

32:55.338 --> 32:58.034
Hey, hey. Calm down. Maybe she's just on
the streetcar on the way to the hospital.

32:58.141 --> 33:00.041
No, no, no, no.
You don't understand.

33:00.143 --> 33:02.634
He said I took from him what could
never be replaced. He's gonna kill her.

33:02.745 --> 33:05.077
Hey, Danny.
Danny, that's not gonna happen, okay?

33:05.181 --> 33:07.911
- We're gonna find her. We're gonna get her back.
- Molly, come on. Pick up.

33:08.017 --> 33:09.109
Pick up!

33:10.586 --> 33:13.453
Molly Porter's phone.

33:13.556 --> 33:16.491
Let me talk to her.

33:16.592 --> 33:19.220
How do you know she's not dead already?

33:19.328 --> 33:20.727
I'm just teasing, Danny.

33:20.830 --> 33:24.527
Come on. Come on.
Where's your sense of humor?

33:29.138 --> 33:31.868
- Here. Say hello to your boyfriend.
- Danny, please.

33:31.974 --> 33:34.499
<i>- We're in a silver va-</i>
- Molly! Molly, where are you?

33:34.610 --> 33:37.078
That one was for free.

33:37.180 --> 33:39.148
<i>The rest you'll have to earn.</i>

33:39.248 --> 33:41.182
I'm gonna find you.

33:41.284 --> 33:43.844
I'm gonna hunt you down,
and I'm gonna kill you.

33:43.953 --> 33:46.217
<i>Well, you know what?</i>
<i>I look forward to that, Danny.</i>

33:46.322 --> 33:49.519
It's a game.
What, you like games, don't you?

33:49.625 --> 33:53.026
Mousetrap, Monopoly, naked Twister.

33:53.129 --> 33:55.188
This one's called 12 Rounds.

33:55.298 --> 33:59.166
<i>Round 1- I took your house.</i>
<i>Round 2- I took Molly.</i>

33:59.268 --> 34:02.999
The only way to keep her alive-
you do exactly what I say when I say it.

34:03.105 --> 34:07.565
<i>If you're still standing after all 12 rounds,</i>
<i>well, then you'll have won her back.</i>

34:07.677 --> 34:11.010
You gotta be kidding me. You can't expect me
to believe that you're gonna keep-

34:11.112 --> 34:13.411
Well-You'll believe
what I tell you to believe, Danny.

34:13.516 --> 34:14.777
<i>I don't think you've got much choice.</i>

34:15.384 --> 34:17.181
<i>Okay. Round 3.</i>

34:17.286 --> 34:20.949
In 15 minutes I will be calling
a particular cell phone in the city.

34:21.056 --> 34:25.755
Why don't you return to where we first met,
see if you can pick up my scent once again?

34:29.065 --> 34:31.260
Okay, uh, Molly said she
was in a silver van, okay?

34:31.367 --> 34:33.301
They can't be more
than six blocks from here.

34:33.402 --> 34:35.734
- Put out an A.P.B., get a trace on Molly's cell.
- Okay.

34:58.160 --> 35:00.720
<i>... your name?</i>

35:00.830 --> 35:02.764
<i>Officer Fisher.</i>

35:06.269 --> 35:09.500
<i>I don't see anything.</i>

35:09.605 --> 35:12.597
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>Maybe we're in the wrong place.</i>

35:12.708 --> 35:15.142
No. This is where we stopped the car.
This is where it started.

35:15.244 --> 35:18.475
And this is where he shot me in the ass.
But I don't see anything.

35:18.581 --> 35:21.516
- How much time?
- Uh, we got 10 minutes.

35:21.617 --> 35:25.576
<i>I definitely think we're</i>
<i>in the wrong place, Danny.</i>

35:25.688 --> 35:29.920
<i>No, wait. I could be wrong.</i>
<i>That's- That's not from Katrina.</i>

35:30.026 --> 35:32.620
- That's today's date.
<i>- You're right.</i>

35:32.728 --> 35:35.288
That's a code. Uh-

35:35.398 --> 35:37.628
We got degrees.
We got clocks.

35:37.733 --> 35:40.031
Yeah, those aren't real clocks though.
There's-There's no hours.

35:40.136 --> 35:41.164
Uh, countdown?

35:41.165 --> 35:44.835
No, no, no. It's just, uh,
two degrees, two clocks.

35:45.941 --> 35:49.775
Degrees, minutes, seconds.

35:49.879 --> 35:51.779
"X."

35:51.881 --> 35:55.282
Longitude and latitude. That's a location.
That's where we're gonna find the phone.

35:55.384 --> 35:57.944
Longitude and latitude. How the hell
do you know about this stuff, Danny?

35:58.054 --> 36:00.113
Eighth-grade geography, brother. Let's go.

36:00.222 --> 36:03.385
Okay, read 'em back to me.

36:03.492 --> 36:07.189
No, no, no, no. Twenty-nine degrees,
57 minutes, three seconds.

36:08.230 --> 36:09.959
Yeah. Got it.
317 Decatur.

36:10.066 --> 36:12.694
317 Decatur?
That's my brother's firehouse.

36:18.941 --> 36:22.536
Ooh-hoo-hoo!

36:22.645 --> 36:24.613
<i>All right. Who's up?</i>

36:24.714 --> 36:27.581
Hey, bro. We're doing an all-day Ping-Pong
tourney. Why don't you come on down?

36:27.683 --> 36:30.413
- You at the station?
- Why are you shouting?

36:30.519 --> 36:33.852
Get everybody out. There may be a bomb
in the house. I'll be there in two minutes.

36:36.659 --> 36:38.752
<i>Movin' out now.</i>

36:51.640 --> 36:53.835
I need the computers patched.
I need a full phone bank.

36:53.836 --> 36:55.167
<i>Yeah, they're clear upstairs.</i>

36:55.277 --> 36:58.075
- Everybody out?
- Yeah.

36:58.180 --> 37:00.705
Danny, you really think this guy
put a bomb in the firehouse?

37:00.816 --> 37:03.876
This guy blew up my house. He took Molly.
I have no idea what he's gonna do next.

37:03.986 --> 37:04.542
Fifteen seconds.

37:04.543 --> 37:06.420
He said he was gonna call a
particular cell phone here.

37:06.522 --> 37:08.752
<i>Everybody, cell phones out.</i>

37:11.293 --> 37:15.753
<i>Five, four, three, two, one.</i>

37:22.905 --> 37:25.738
You hear that?
It's right there. It's right there.

37:28.677 --> 37:30.440
<i>- Can I help you?</i>

37:30.546 --> 37:32.776
Hey, Jansen.
Give me a second.

37:32.882 --> 37:36.079
- Hello?
Look at that, Danny. Right on time.

37:36.185 --> 37:39.279
You've just earned yourself
extra minutes on the next task.

37:39.522 --> 37:43.253
<i>Go. I'm on three.</i>

37:43.359 --> 37:47.159
<i>And speak of the devil,</i>
<i>there's the bell for Round 4.</i>

37:47.263 --> 37:51.222
There's a fire
in the Orleans Savings and Loan.

37:51.333 --> 37:54.564
<i>In the memory chip</i>
<i>of the phone you're holding...</i>

37:54.670 --> 37:58.106
<i>are the numbers of two security deposit boxes</i>
<i>located on the 10th floor.</i>

37:58.207 --> 38:02.007
<i>To win, simply grab those boxes...</i>

38:02.111 --> 38:04.602
by 5:55 exactly...

38:04.713 --> 38:08.809
or there's gonna be an early knockout.

38:08.918 --> 38:11.182
You gotta be shittin' me.

38:11.287 --> 38:13.847
Uh, not enough time.
I'm just gonna come in.

38:13.956 --> 38:17.517
<i>Yeah. I'll be right there.</i>

38:17.626 --> 38:19.992
Hey, hey. Tel-com is up on your phone.

38:20.095 --> 38:22.723
They just think they found the van
that Miles used to take Molly.

38:22.832 --> 38:25.733
I'm gonna go back and set up a war room,
all right? You okay?

38:31.974 --> 38:35.671
<i>Hey, hey.</i>
<i>Hey, hey, hey! Focus.</i>

38:35.778 --> 38:38.212
Molly needs you to focus.
All right?

38:38.314 --> 38:40.976
We gotta do this.
You gotta help me find her.

38:42.952 --> 38:45.716
When have I ever
let you down before? Huh?

38:45.821 --> 38:47.721
You're right.

38:47.823 --> 38:50.223
All right?
Go get this done.

39:01.270 --> 39:03.636
- Detective Fisher?
- Yeah.

39:03.739 --> 39:05.707
Ray Santiago, F.B.I.
This is Inspector George Aiken.

39:05.808 --> 39:08.538
We understand that Miles Jackson's
resurfaced in the area.

39:08.644 --> 39:10.703
- What'd you just say?
- Miles Jackson.

39:10.813 --> 39:12.804
- We heard he tried to contact you-
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:12.915 --> 39:15.884
The guy breaks out of prison,
F.B.I. knows about it, and nobody tells me?

39:15.985 --> 39:18.419
- We understand that you're upset, Danny-
- It was none of your business.

39:18.521 --> 39:20.921
You can keep on crying about
what you did and didn't know...

39:21.023 --> 39:24.982
or you can tell us everything that happened
this morning since you woke up.

39:25.094 --> 39:27.927
That is, if you want your girl back.

39:28.030 --> 39:31.659
<i>- Engine two, let's move out.</i>
- Danny, you catching a ride?

39:31.767 --> 39:33.735
We're your best chance, Danny.

39:33.836 --> 39:37.328
Tell us what we wanna know,
we'll tell you what you wanna know.

39:37.439 --> 39:42.103
You better talk as fast as they drive.

39:55.858 --> 39:57.723
There was a prison break
in Florida two weeks ago.

39:57.826 --> 40:00.056
<i>Miles and the inmates took the guards,</i>
<i>killed the warden...</i>

40:00.162 --> 40:02.289
and demanded 30 cars
to drive out of the prison.

40:02.398 --> 40:05.765
- And you gave them to them?
- Wasn't exactly our choice, Danny.

40:05.868 --> 40:08.803
<i>The bureau gave them cars</i>
<i>with kill switches and remote door locks.</i>

40:08.904 --> 40:11.270
<i>The inmates get three blocks away from the yard,</i>
<i>National Guard comes in...</i>

40:11.373 --> 40:13.568
puts everyone back in their cells.

40:13.676 --> 40:16.702
- Everyone except Miles.
- Would you please just shut up?

40:16.812 --> 40:18.905
You're killing me with the whining.

40:19.014 --> 40:21.073
<i>You have no idea</i>
<i>what you're up against, do you?</i>

40:21.183 --> 40:23.117
I know you "arrested" him,
but you still don't know.

40:23.218 --> 40:25.880
<i>The fact Miles Jackson</i>
<i>has your girlfriend-</i>

40:25.988 --> 40:27.888
mmm, that interests me very little.

40:27.990 --> 40:30.720
<i>The fact that he's done something</i>
<i>that he never does...</i>

40:30.826 --> 40:33.624
the fact that he's
shown himself in the city-

40:33.729 --> 40:36.061
that interests me quite a bit more.

40:36.165 --> 40:39.066
You wanna catch Miles?
That's fine.

40:39.168 --> 40:41.728
I wanna keep Molly alive,
and I know what I gotta do.

40:46.275 --> 40:49.403
Just stay the hell out of my way.

40:53.015 --> 40:55.415
I guess he didn't hear me
about the whining.

40:55.517 --> 40:57.178
Sir, this is exactly what Miles wants.

40:57.286 --> 40:59.846
<i>We should stop Danny</i>
<i>before somebody gets hurt.</i>

40:59.955 --> 41:02.822
Danny? What, are you best friends now?

41:02.925 --> 41:05.120
<i>If Danny keeps playing the game,</i>
<i>Miles is distracted.</i>

41:05.227 --> 41:09.391
Miles is distracted,
he might make a mistake-

41:09.498 --> 41:11.466
and I'll bury him.

41:12.635 --> 41:14.500
Come on!

41:14.603 --> 41:16.662
- Dave.
- Danny.

41:16.772 --> 41:20.139
<i>- How much time?</i>
- Six minutes.

41:22.811 --> 41:25.177
<i>Let's go!
Let's head up the south stairwell.</i>

41:25.280 --> 41:27.805
Smoke on 10, guys.
Come on. Let's go! Let's go!

41:32.821 --> 41:35.847
Let's go.
Let's get a line up there.

41:37.092 --> 41:40.357
Let's go!
Keep moving! Keep moving.

41:40.462 --> 41:42.362
<i>The guys are going up the stairwell now!</i>

41:42.464 --> 41:45.399
<i>Come on, guys.</i>
<i>Let's move it!</i>

41:54.009 --> 41:55.670
Listen up!

41:55.778 --> 41:58.542
Listen up.
I need everybody.

41:58.647 --> 42:02.981
All right. Thirty-two minutes ago,
Molly Porter was taken from the Canal Street ferry.

42:03.085 --> 42:07.021
We need every security camera, every
possible witness, every vehicle plate number.

42:08.657 --> 42:11.182
This asshole calls again,
I wanna know where he is.

42:11.293 --> 42:13.989
<i>I wanna know what he's doing.</i>
<i>I wanna find him before he so much as thinks...</i>

42:14.096 --> 42:16.030
about touching one hair on her head.

42:16.131 --> 42:19.430
This could be your girlfriend,
could be your wife.

42:19.535 --> 42:22.003
Could be any one of us.

42:22.104 --> 42:25.665
All right.
This asshole cannot win.

42:37.786 --> 42:40.516
<i>- We got some spare air bottles?</i>

42:47.696 --> 42:51.188
<i>All right.</i>
<i>Clear that backroom!</i>

42:51.300 --> 42:53.461
- Dave!
- Yeah.

42:55.137 --> 42:57.367
Watch yourself.

43:03.712 --> 43:06.010
How much time?

43:06.115 --> 43:08.242
Two minutes.

43:10.853 --> 43:13.413
Hold this.

43:16.492 --> 43:18.221
<i>It's 590. 591.</i>

43:18.327 --> 43:20.761
Right there.

43:34.743 --> 43:36.734
Danny.

43:44.887 --> 43:47.412
Surprise!

43:47.523 --> 43:50.686
Sometimes victory is not
all it's cracked up to be.

43:50.793 --> 43:53.455
Eh, Danny? Round 5!

43:53.562 --> 43:57.464
<i>Two pounds of explosives</i>
<i>packed inside one of these boxes.</i>

43:57.566 --> 44:01.332
You now have less than seven minutes
to cross the 23 city blocks...

44:01.436 --> 44:03.836
between here
and the Nicholls Street Wharf.

44:03.939 --> 44:06.032
<i>Arrive at the wharfany later,</i>
<i>the bomb goes off.</i>

44:06.141 --> 44:09.338
<i>The other box contains</i>
<i>the clue to the next round.</i>

44:09.444 --> 44:12.845
<i>See, in your time constraints,</i>
<i>you might wanna use the fire truck for this one.</i>

44:12.948 --> 44:17.044
<i>Oh, yeah. And don't forget</i>
<i>to wear the hat and use the siren.</i>

44:18.821 --> 44:20.618
Seven minutes?

44:20.722 --> 44:23.282
We won't even be out of the building
in seven minutes.

44:23.392 --> 44:25.360
That's if we take the stairs.

44:26.628 --> 44:29.722
<i>Danny!</i>

44:31.667 --> 44:34.363
<i>Ten is clear! Repeat, no fire!</i>

44:34.469 --> 44:37.802
<i>Just a bunch of smoke bombs!</i>

44:39.842 --> 44:41.673
What are you doing?

44:41.777 --> 44:43.802
<i>Get them all out of the building!</i>

44:43.912 --> 44:47.348
You got gloves?
Give them here.

44:50.018 --> 44:53.476
When you get out of here, you get to Atlanta,
you find Mom and you stay with her.

44:53.589 --> 44:56.422
Make sure she's safe.
I don't want this guy havin' another chance.

44:56.525 --> 44:59.323
- Anchor this down.
- Danny-

44:59.428 --> 45:01.555
Anchor it down!

45:03.832 --> 45:06.323
Danny, you can't do this!

45:19.681 --> 45:22.115
Oh, shoot!
Do you see that man?

45:24.553 --> 45:27.454
<i>Folks, I'm gonna ask
you to back up, please.</i>

45:47.709 --> 45:49.802
<i>You got triage ready to go?</i>

45:51.813 --> 45:54.907
Danny!

45:57.052 --> 46:00.783
<i>Everybody accounted for?</i>
<i>Have 'em all respond on tac channel two.</i>

46:00.889 --> 46:02.789
<i>They're moving out now!</i>

46:09.831 --> 46:13.096
Hey, what are you doing?
Look out!

46:13.201 --> 46:16.762
<i>You, out of the truck now!</i>

46:16.872 --> 46:19.773
<i>- Hey, what are you doin'?</i>

46:42.864 --> 46:44.525
<i>Did you get the trace?</i>

46:44.633 --> 46:47.830
<i>No, he's using an encrypted signal.</i>
<i>We can't even pull a number to start a trace.</i>

46:47.936 --> 46:50.336
What's that sound, Danny?

46:50.439 --> 46:54.466
- I'm driving a fire truck.
- Are you sure that's such a good idea right now?

46:54.576 --> 46:55.804
Oh!

47:06.221 --> 47:10.954
Call the bomb squad!
Get them to Nicholls Street Wharf! I gotta go!

47:13.717 --> 47:14.979
Stay with him.

47:22.692 --> 47:24.956
Hey! Look out!

48:18.637 --> 48:21.333
No, no, no!
What are you doin'?

48:29.815 --> 48:31.248
Yo, hey! Hey! Chill!

48:37.489 --> 48:38.956
Sorry!

49:17.928 --> 49:21.261
Shut down the timers, Miles. I'm here.

49:21.365 --> 49:26.234
<i>Well done, Danny, but I'm sorry to say,</i>
<i>you seem to be a bit late to the party.</i>

49:47.822 --> 49:51.656
It was the bell. The bell signals
the start of the next round.

49:51.759 --> 49:54.660
Oh, you're finally starting
to get the hang of this.

49:54.762 --> 49:56.753
I wanna speak to Molly.

49:56.865 --> 50:00.460
How about I do you one better?
How about I show her to you?

50:00.568 --> 50:04.470
<i>As I said, the clue to the next round</i>
<i>is in the box you so deftly hung on to.</i>

50:04.572 --> 50:06.699
<i>You put two and two together...</i>

50:06.808 --> 50:09.606
you might have quite the reunion.

50:10.812 --> 50:13.542
Tell me you didn't kill anybody
with that thing.

50:19.954 --> 50:21.854
I need a saw.

50:28.396 --> 50:31.832
<i> All right. Let's drain this thing</i>
<i>and get it back to the yard.</i>

50:37.238 --> 50:39.706
It's clear.

50:42.810 --> 50:45.870
- Thought you guys were gonna catch him.
- We switched out your SIM card.

50:45.980 --> 50:48.881
We're tapped into your phone.
We can track you wherever you go.

50:48.983 --> 50:52.419
Miles will call again, Danny. When he does,
keep him on the line for 30 seconds.

50:52.520 --> 50:55.182
- That's all we need.
- Miles's phone's encrypted. You can't trace it.

50:55.290 --> 50:57.258
That's funny.
We're the F.B.I., not Mayberry P.D.

50:57.358 --> 50:59.417
All we need is 30 seconds.

50:59.527 --> 51:03.691
All teams, listen up, listen up!
We have a location.

51:03.798 --> 51:07.529
<i>It's the Hotel Monteleone.</i>
<i>I repeat. It's the Hotel Monteleone.</i>

51:07.635 --> 51:12.004
I need SWAT, and I need K-9,
and I need all of you there. Now!

51:19.614 --> 51:22.913
<i>Get the elevators shut down.</i>
<i>Secure the street. K-9 unit inside.</i>

51:23.017 --> 51:26.043
- Get against the wall.
- Down! Everybody down!

51:29.524 --> 51:32.288
Blue team, seal all the exits.
I need snipers on the roof.

51:32.393 --> 51:35.794
Shut down all communication in and out
of the building, and start with the dogs.

51:35.897 --> 51:39.799
Ray, pull the tapes.
I need to know what room this key is for.

51:39.901 --> 51:41.664
<i>- Where's your control room?</i>
<i>- Right this way.</i>

51:41.769 --> 51:43.066
<i>Thank you.</i>

51:45.039 --> 51:46.904
It's clean.

51:54.515 --> 51:57.814
- Clear!
- Clear. Fisher!

52:24.812 --> 52:27.246
<i>Fisher.</i>

52:33.721 --> 52:36.519
Come on, come on, come on.
Where are you?

52:38.459 --> 52:40.620
- He was here.
- I got nothing.

52:40.728 --> 52:43.196
- Ray, get the teams ready to act.
- All right.

52:48.635 --> 52:51.229
That's it. That's Miles.
Stop it right there.

52:51.338 --> 52:54.603
- What time was this?
- It was, like, 30 minutes ago.

52:54.708 --> 52:58.269
- He's writing something down.
- It's a sign.

52:58.378 --> 53:00.312
What's it say?

53:03.150 --> 53:05.345
"We're still here."

53:07.521 --> 53:10.649
All the exits are locked down.

53:10.758 --> 53:13.693
All right. We just found Miles on camera.
Stand by for location.

53:13.794 --> 53:16.888
Yeah, hold on. He's, uh-
He's talking to somebody.

53:16.997 --> 53:19.659
- They're leading him somewhere.
- Who is that?

53:21.335 --> 53:23.235
It's Willie.

53:26.373 --> 53:30.833
- I'm gonna go find Willie.
- Show me everything. I need a location.

53:30.944 --> 53:34.471
So, Miles rented the S.U.V. last week
in Lafayette, left a dummy address.

53:34.581 --> 53:38.347
We're tracking the I.D. on the security deposit
boxes and known accomplices, but so far nothing.

53:38.452 --> 53:41.944
What are we missing? This guy doesn't
plan everything and not leave a trail.

53:42.055 --> 53:44.615
- Let's go over the prison break again.
- All right.

53:44.725 --> 53:46.625
<i>Miles and the boys take the yard.</i>

53:46.727 --> 53:48.285
But Miles is the only one who escapes.

53:48.395 --> 53:51.125
How many of these guys got into cars,
but wound up back in their cells?

53:51.231 --> 53:53.222
Forty-three.
But the F.B.I. already talked to 'em all.

53:53.333 --> 53:56.461
- Get me the warden on the phone.
- You got it.

53:56.653 --> 53:58.985
He gave Miles the access code
to the security elevator.

53:59.088 --> 54:01.488
It goes all the way to the basement.
I'll meet you there.

54:03.026 --> 54:05.392
Hey, sorry if I did
something wrong before.

54:05.495 --> 54:07.554
This guy, he had all the right papers.

54:07.664 --> 54:09.689
Said he was here to service
the air-conditioning.

54:09.799 --> 54:11.767
It's okay. You didn't know.

54:11.868 --> 54:14.359
- This thing still works?
- One of the oldest in the city.

54:28.985 --> 54:32.546
<i>I led him this far. Said he'd go</i>
<i>the rest of the way on his own.</i>

54:32.655 --> 54:36.091
Wait. Those air-conditioning ducts-
they go straight to the top?

54:36.192 --> 54:38.854
- Yeah. They vent out to the roof.
<i>- Take me there.</i>

54:53.276 --> 54:56.404
- Sir, we're clear. There's no sign of Miles.
- So where's Fisher?

55:17.133 --> 55:19.693
- Tell me that's normal.
- Uh-

55:24.373 --> 55:27.240
- No service.
- Well-

55:27.343 --> 55:29.743
- What's this for?
- There's supposed to be a phone there, right?

55:29.846 --> 55:31.541
Yeah, but-

55:34.283 --> 55:37.116
Told ya I'd show her to you, Danny.

55:39.021 --> 55:40.955
"Danny.

55:41.057 --> 55:46.461
"If you're viewing this,
Round 6 has already started.

55:46.562 --> 55:48.496
"I'm sure you've met
your new friend, Willie.

55:48.598 --> 55:51.829
"Sorry, Willie.
Nothing personal-

55:51.934 --> 55:54.129
"just the wrong place at the wrong time.

55:55.438 --> 55:57.531
<i>"At the conclusion of this message-</i>

55:59.475 --> 56:02.308
"you'll have 60 seconds...

56:02.411 --> 56:05.471
"before the elevator
free-falls to the ground.

56:07.717 --> 56:09.617
"With 60 seconds, limited resources...

56:09.719 --> 56:11.653
<i>"and Willie's unfortunate girth...</i>

56:11.754 --> 56:16.191
"there's only time
for one of you to survive.

56:16.292 --> 56:19.750
<i>"Who lives and who dies-</i>
<i>that is your decision.</i>

56:19.862 --> 56:25.528
"For the lucky, the clue to Round 7
is framed in the lobby.

56:25.635 --> 56:27.865
For the other,
at least you'll be a lot thinner."

56:27.970 --> 56:30.165
Danny, he made me read this to you.

56:30.273 --> 56:32.434
<i>Is that for real, man?</i>

56:32.542 --> 56:34.510
- I can't die. I got a wife and kids.
- Where's the security hatch?

56:34.610 --> 56:37.135
- I got a radio.
- There's no time. How do I open this thing?

56:37.246 --> 56:39.976
- You gonna leave me here?
- No. Watch the clock.

56:40.082 --> 56:42.312
<i>- The latch! On top! Look for the latch.</i>
- I got it.

56:44.253 --> 56:46.847
Stay right there.
I'll get you out.

56:46.956 --> 56:49.390
Shit, I can't fit through there.

56:49.492 --> 56:51.722
- All right, big man, let's go.
- I can't. It's too far.

56:51.828 --> 56:54.023
<i>You gotta pull. It's your only hope.</i>
<i>Give me your hand.</i>

56:54.130 --> 56:56.030
Come on. Let's go. Up!

56:56.132 --> 56:58.999
- Come on. You can reach.
- It's too far, man.

56:59.101 --> 57:01.331
Come on. You can make it.

57:01.437 --> 57:03.905
<i>- Pull!</i>

57:07.410 --> 57:09.207
<i>Willie, come on!</i>
<i>Come on!</i>

57:09.312 --> 57:11.246
<i>You gotta get up, buddy.</i>
<i>Come on.</i>

57:11.347 --> 57:13.315
- How much time?
- Less than 40 seconds!

57:13.416 --> 57:16.180
That means we need to work together.
Come on, buddy.

57:16.285 --> 57:19.345
- Don't let go! Don't let go!
- I got you! I got you!

57:19.455 --> 57:24.358
Pull, Danny!

57:24.460 --> 57:28.897
I don't wanna die.

57:28.998 --> 57:32.832
<i>- Come on!</i>
- Don't let go!

57:32.935 --> 57:35.904
You're almost there.

57:36.005 --> 57:38.701
Made it!

57:38.808 --> 57:41.436
I can't believe I made it.

57:41.544 --> 57:43.739
Oh! My back!
I can't move.

57:43.846 --> 57:46.007
Willie, the elevator's gonna fall.
I need your hand.

57:46.115 --> 57:48.049
<i>You gotta get on the ledge.</i>
<i>I need you on the ledge.</i>

57:48.150 --> 57:51.085
<i>I can't! I can't!</i>
<i>My back!</i>

57:51.187 --> 57:53.553
<i>- You can make it!</i>
<i>- I got it!</i>

57:55.324 --> 57:58.782
Willie!

58:28.991 --> 58:31.425
<i> All teams, commence</i>
<i>evacuation of three-city-block radius.</i>

58:31.527 --> 58:34.963
- Let's go. Keep moving.
<i>- High-pressure gas leak in hotel.</i>

58:35.064 --> 58:39.262
<i>All teams, reposition to clear</i>
<i>three-city-block radius.</i>

58:39.368 --> 58:42.269
<i>Clear the area!
Evacuate the mint!</i>

58:42.371 --> 58:45.169
<i>Go! Move!</i>

58:45.274 --> 58:49.574
<i>All battalions, evacuate the area.
Staging "B."</i>

58:49.679 --> 58:52.079
<i>Okay, Captain.</i>

58:54.183 --> 58:56.174
<i>That's affirmative.</i>

58:57.920 --> 59:00.150
People, back! Back!

59:12.234 --> 59:14.532
<i>I can't die.
I've got a wife and kids.</i>

59:20.376 --> 59:21.775
<i>You did everything you could.</i>

59:22.912 --> 59:26.746
Danny. Miles didn't give you enough time.

59:26.849 --> 59:29.215
<i>Hold it. Hold it.
Get me Terry.</i>

59:29.318 --> 59:32.481
Somebody bring me Terry.
Come on. Set it up.

59:32.588 --> 59:34.954
All right.

59:37.927 --> 59:39.895
Thirty seconds.

59:42.465 --> 59:45.628
- Yeah?
- Danny, you sound upset.

59:45.735 --> 59:47.327
<i>I did everything you asked, Miles.</i>

59:47.436 --> 59:49.336
You had no reason to kill him.

59:49.438 --> 59:52.532
I didn't, Danny.
You had the choice to save him.

59:52.641 --> 59:55.667
- It was your round to win.
- Bullshit!

59:55.778 --> 59:57.746
Screw your choices!
Screw your rounds!

59:57.847 --> 01:00:00.611
Are you givin' up on me?
'Cause if you wanna stop playin'...

01:00:00.716 --> 01:00:03.651
<i>I'm sure other arrangements can be made.</i>

01:00:03.753 --> 01:00:07.280
- No.
- All right. So, as Molly said...

01:00:07.390 --> 01:00:09.824
- the clue to the next round-
- Molly said nothing!

01:00:09.925 --> 01:00:13.725
I just watched a man die,
and I don't even know if Molly's still alive.

01:00:13.829 --> 01:00:15.694
Excuse me?

01:00:15.798 --> 01:00:17.925
<i>Keep him on.</i>

01:00:18.034 --> 01:00:19.934
<i>I need a minute to figure this out.</i>

01:00:20.036 --> 01:00:22.231
<i>There's nothin' to figure, Danny.</i>

01:00:23.939 --> 01:00:26.066
Is the F.B.I. tryin' to trace this call?

01:00:26.175 --> 01:00:28.268
<i>Tsk, tsk, tsk.</i>
<i>Let me guess.</i>

01:00:28.377 --> 01:00:32.336
First it was your friends in the police department
who realized the cell was encrypted.

01:00:32.448 --> 01:00:34.814
Then it was the F.B.I. -

01:00:34.917 --> 01:00:38.478
George Aiken
and all his wonderful little toys?

01:00:38.587 --> 01:00:40.919
Hold for position.
Everybody hold for position.

01:00:41.023 --> 01:00:45.289
I must say, I really am touched...

01:00:45.394 --> 01:00:47.919
how you've all come together
for this little affair.

01:00:50.166 --> 01:00:53.761
Not enough time.

01:01:02.945 --> 01:01:06.642
- Yeah.
- So why don't we start over again...

01:01:06.749 --> 01:01:08.740
see if it's that much fun
the second time around.

01:01:08.851 --> 01:01:11.376
<i>Or maybe-</i>

01:01:25.668 --> 01:01:27.761
- Yeah.
- Third time lucky?

01:01:27.870 --> 01:01:33.502
So, as Molly said before, the clue
to the next round is framed in the lobby-

01:01:33.609 --> 01:01:37.807
a picture of a lonely man, which is how
you'll end up if you don't play nice.

01:01:37.913 --> 01:01:42.009
You try and trace my call again,
I am gonna start cutting Molly's toes off.

01:01:42.118 --> 01:01:45.986
So, how about I call you again
in two minutes?

01:01:46.088 --> 01:01:49.148
<i>Would that give you ample time to grieve?</i>

01:01:50.559 --> 01:01:52.527
We lost the signal.

01:02:00.035 --> 01:02:02.003
Miles says hello.

01:02:03.439 --> 01:02:05.430
<i>This isn't working.</i>

01:02:05.541 --> 01:02:08.135
Before today, the feds
have been up on Miles's cell phone...

01:02:08.244 --> 01:02:10.144
a grand total of one time.

01:02:10.246 --> 01:02:12.146
It's working just fine.

01:02:12.248 --> 01:02:15.411
If Danny keeps doing this,
a lot more people are gonna get hurt.

01:02:53.856 --> 01:02:57.348
<i>- Don't answer the phone.</i>
- What the hell you think you're doin'?

01:02:57.459 --> 01:02:59.359
Listen to me for a second,
all right, Danny?

01:02:59.461 --> 01:03:01.101
Willie can be the last person
who has to die today.

01:03:01.102 --> 01:03:01.827
Answer the goddamn phone.

01:03:01.931 --> 01:03:05.059
- We'll find Molly.
- Shut up! Answer the goddamn phone.

01:03:06.769 --> 01:03:09.761
- It's Claiborne and Toulouse.
- Well done, Danny.

01:03:09.872 --> 01:03:13.273
I must say, I am impressed
with your detective skills...

01:03:13.375 --> 01:03:15.605
<i>but with all the help</i>
<i>you've been gettin' from the F.B. I...</i>

01:03:15.711 --> 01:03:17.770
<i>it seems just a little bit unfair.</i>

01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:21.043
I'm playing the game, Miles.
That's all that counts, right?

01:03:21.150 --> 01:03:25.348
How very true, but it's time
to see you play for yourself for a change.

01:03:25.454 --> 01:03:27.422
Be at the location in the photo
in 10 minutes.

01:03:27.523 --> 01:03:30.219
You come alone,
and you'll have a 50-50 chance...

01:03:30.326 --> 01:03:32.226
of having the time of your life.

01:03:32.328 --> 01:03:34.091
We're more than halfway through, Danny.

01:03:34.196 --> 01:03:37.188
And I've got a little bit of a surprise for ya.

01:03:51.113 --> 01:03:53.673
Don't be a hero, Ray.

01:03:53.782 --> 01:03:55.682
It's not in your pay grade.

01:04:10.499 --> 01:04:13.161
<i>Danny, we got two
teams three blocks out.</i>

01:04:13.269 --> 01:04:15.169
<i>What do you see?</i>

01:04:18.073 --> 01:04:20.007
I don't see anything.

01:04:20.109 --> 01:04:23.442
He said 10 minutes, Danny.
It's been 10.

01:04:33.122 --> 01:04:35.682
<i>Still got nothin'.</i>

01:04:37.793 --> 01:04:40.762
<i>Just stay in your position.</i>

01:04:40.863 --> 01:04:43.161
<i>We got you covered.</i>
<i>Stay right there.</i>

01:04:44.697 --> 01:04:47.292
Whatever.
I don't know if he's gonna go pro.

01:04:47.403 --> 01:04:50.998
- Tell me you've got something.
- Danny, get ready to be happy.

01:04:51.106 --> 01:04:54.166
I got a pissed-off member
of the Black Liberation Army is what I got.

01:04:54.276 --> 01:04:56.437
Miles had him kill a couple guards
during the prison break...

01:04:56.545 --> 01:04:59.105
and then left the brother behind
to take the fall.

01:04:59.214 --> 01:05:02.206
- When can you get him to talk?
- Soon as I get the judge to sign the warrant.

01:05:02.318 --> 01:05:04.377
<i>Give me 10 minutes.</i>

01:05:07.823 --> 01:05:11.190
- I'm gonna need it in two.
<i>- You got a 50-50 chance.</i>

01:05:11.293 --> 01:05:14.319
It's the bus.
I'm getting on.

01:05:25.841 --> 01:05:27.536
- Molly?
<i>- Stop.</i>

01:06:10.486 --> 01:06:12.249
Danny, I love you.

01:06:19.828 --> 01:06:21.955
You two lovebirds care for a sit?

01:06:29.738 --> 01:06:31.638
I'm gonna get you out of this.

01:06:33.642 --> 01:06:37.408
<i>- Was he just talking to someone?</i>
- Just stay calm, Molly.

01:06:58.567 --> 01:07:00.467
Ah, well, look at this.
Surprise, surprise.

01:07:00.569 --> 01:07:03.094
Testing. Testing.
One-

01:07:03.205 --> 01:07:05.730
Was that Miles?

01:07:05.841 --> 01:07:08.776
- Does he have Miles on the phone, or is he there?
<i>- Miles is on the bus.</i>

01:07:08.877 --> 01:07:11.175
All teams, we have a confirmation.
Miles Jackson is on the bus.

01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:15.011
<i>Proceed with Op 2 Delta</i>
<i>and get me a sniper team out here now.</i>

01:07:17.453 --> 01:07:19.284
<i>This is it.</i>
<i>This is his mistake.</i>

01:07:19.388 --> 01:07:21.788
We got SWAT ready.
Why don't we just take him out now?

01:07:21.890 --> 01:07:24.120
We stop that bus now,
he turns this into a bloodbath.

01:07:24.226 --> 01:07:26.285
<i>We know where he is.</i>
<i>We're takin' our shot.</i>

01:07:26.395 --> 01:07:29.796
Alpha 1, set up
and prepare to stop the target.

01:07:29.898 --> 01:07:32.799
<i>Can't have you runnin' off,
now, can I?</i>

01:07:35.537 --> 01:07:38.097
<i>Round 7, Danny.</i>

01:07:38.207 --> 01:07:42.473
<i>To win, you simply let me walk away.</i>

01:07:42.578 --> 01:07:48.039
<i>But if my thumb leaves</i>
<i>the surface of this screen for any reason...</i>

01:07:48.150 --> 01:07:51.176
and I don't put it back
within 10 seconds or less...

01:07:51.286 --> 01:07:56.383
<i>well, then you lose the round,</i>
<i>and two things happen.</i>

01:07:56.492 --> 01:07:59.188
<i>First of all, a small charge explodes...</i>

01:07:59.294 --> 01:08:01.785
and fires a three-inch nail
into Molly's heart.

01:08:01.897 --> 01:08:04.957
<i>I'm aiming for the right atrium,</i>
<i>but we'll see what happens.</i>

01:08:05.067 --> 01:08:07.558
Thirty seconds later, after she's dead...

01:08:07.669 --> 01:08:10.661
<i>a second, larger charge will explode...</i>

01:08:10.772 --> 01:08:14.367
<i>and they'll be cleaning</i>
<i>everyone up off this bus in pieces.</i>

01:08:18.846 --> 01:08:21.839
What can I say, Danny?
I just like to play the game.

01:08:21.950 --> 01:08:26.580
- I didn't mean for Erica to die.
- I don't think that matters.

01:08:30.024 --> 01:08:33.358
That's the one I want.
Set up on the 10 overpass.

01:08:33.462 --> 01:08:36.090
<i>SWAT team, this is Agent Santiago.</i>

01:08:36.198 --> 01:08:38.666
<i>Take position at the north</i>
<i>on the interstate overpass at Perdido.</i>

01:08:38.767 --> 01:08:40.734
<i>Await instructions.</i>

01:08:43.871 --> 01:08:45.839
Here. Catch.

01:08:49.343 --> 01:08:51.709
<i>Oh, you should see the look on your faces.</i>

01:08:51.812 --> 01:08:54.712
Miles, let her go.
It's between you and me.

01:08:54.814 --> 01:08:58.251
Well, I'm afraid, if I let Molly go, Danny,
you won't play the game.

01:08:58.352 --> 01:09:01.082
<i>Look at those eyes.</i>

01:09:01.188 --> 01:09:04.555
You're thinkin',
"Can I get to the phone on time?

01:09:04.658 --> 01:09:07.040
Why did Miles ask to meet me here?"

01:09:07.075 --> 01:09:09.421
- Ha!
- Is there somethin' funny?

01:09:09.532 --> 01:09:12.228
<i>Yeah, there is.</i>

01:09:12.335 --> 01:09:14.859
He's gonna win,
and then he's gonna kill you.

01:09:14.970 --> 01:09:17.029
She's a feisty one, isn't she?

01:09:24.196 --> 01:09:26.687
- Three cover men on the west side.
- Got it.

01:09:26.799 --> 01:09:28.960
Jason, you're scout.
Set up section one.

01:09:29.068 --> 01:09:32.265
<i>Sniper Team 1,
T.R.T. team in place.</i>

01:09:32.371 --> 01:09:36.307
- What if I don't believe you?
- Sorry?

01:09:36.408 --> 01:09:39.469
What if I think that vest is for show?

01:09:39.578 --> 01:09:43.310
Pick everybody up in pieces?
Miles, that bomb blows, you die too.

01:09:44.584 --> 01:09:46.814
What's keeping me
from reaching over there...

01:09:46.919 --> 01:09:49.149
and kicking the shit out of you?

01:09:49.255 --> 01:09:51.381
Nothing.

01:09:51.490 --> 01:09:53.890
<i>But I know you won't-</i>

01:09:53.993 --> 01:09:56.154
'cause you're predictable, Danny.

01:09:58.064 --> 01:10:00.032
You think I'm lyin'?

01:10:01.267 --> 01:10:03.201
Here. Take it.

01:10:03.302 --> 01:10:05.270
<i>All teams, hold on my mark.</i>

01:10:16.415 --> 01:10:18.815
<i>Sir, that's a 75-yard shot</i>
<i>through a moving bus window.</i>

01:10:18.918 --> 01:10:22.012
<i>One sniper's gotta break the glass,</i>
<i>another one's gotta get the hit.</i>

01:10:22.121 --> 01:10:24.316
- You sure this is how you wanna do this?
<i>- Team Delta, prepare for visual.</i>

01:10:24.423 --> 01:10:27.324
Teams Bravo and Charlie,
hold for extract once shots are fired.

01:10:27.426 --> 01:10:30.418
<i>This is Delta 1.</i>
<i>We have confirmed subject, but no clear shot.</i>

01:10:30.529 --> 01:10:33.692
No clear shot. Female hostage
is in and out of the target line.

01:10:35.201 --> 01:10:38.967
Don't wanna take it? Fine.

01:10:39.071 --> 01:10:42.700
Well, here's something
that you will want- clue to Round 8.

01:10:47.847 --> 01:10:50.008
<i>Sniper Team 1,
you have the green light.</i>

01:10:50.116 --> 01:10:53.449
I repeat. You have the green light.
Take him out.

01:10:53.552 --> 01:10:57.181
- You know you're gonna kill that girl.
- I'm gonna kill Miles.

01:10:57.890 --> 01:10:59.585
On my mark.

01:11:02.495 --> 01:11:04.622
- Go.
- Get down!

01:11:10.469 --> 01:11:12.369
Target is not down.

01:11:22.515 --> 01:11:26.508
<i>- Move!</i>

01:11:26.619 --> 01:11:29.554
Officer Fisher, I didn't know you cared.

01:11:29.655 --> 01:11:32.146
<i>- Come on.</i>

01:11:32.258 --> 01:11:35.455
- Molly!
<i>- </i>

01:11:36.829 --> 01:11:38.888
<i>- What the hell happened?</i>

01:11:38.998 --> 01:11:42.195
And get me a 20 on Miles.
Somebody get me a 20 on Miles.

01:11:42.301 --> 01:11:44.428
<i>Negative.</i>
<i>Lost him in the crowd.</i>

01:11:50.509 --> 01:11:52.977
I need you to stop everything
getting on the 10 and the 90.

01:11:53.079 --> 01:11:55.912
<i>Hear me.
The 10 needs to stop traffic.</i>

01:11:56.015 --> 01:12:00.611
Clear!

01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:03.280
<i>Listen here.
Ready to do this?</i>

01:12:07.693 --> 01:12:09.923
<i>You could've killed her! You knew</i>
<i>she was there and you took the shot!</i>

01:12:10.029 --> 01:12:13.068
Listen to me, you little shit!
We had him! This was over!

01:12:13.069 --> 01:12:13.487
<i>No!</i>

01:12:13.599 --> 01:12:15.499
You shoot Miles,
everybody on that bus is dead!

01:12:15.601 --> 01:12:19.093
<i>You didn't know that, did you, you prick!</i>

01:12:19.205 --> 01:12:21.105
She had a bomb on her chest.

01:12:21.207 --> 01:12:23.835
<i>You shoot Miles, everybody dies.</i>

01:12:27.980 --> 01:12:30.312
You got a little somethin' right there.

01:12:30.416 --> 01:12:32.782
<i>You heard him.
Back 'em up.</i>

01:12:32.885 --> 01:12:34.819
<i>Any witnesses see him get off the bus?</i>

01:12:39.458 --> 01:12:42.325
You okay, Danny?
You all right?

01:12:42.428 --> 01:12:44.953
I had her in my arms, man.

01:12:45.064 --> 01:12:47.362
I told her I was gonna save her,
and I let her go.

01:12:47.466 --> 01:12:50.526
There was nothing you could do, bro.

01:12:50.636 --> 01:12:52.797
Molly's gonna die.
It's my fault.

01:12:52.905 --> 01:12:54.896
She's not gonna die, Danny.
You gotta stop blaming yourself.

01:12:55.007 --> 01:12:56.907
I can't. You know why?

01:12:57.009 --> 01:12:59.170
Because Miles is punishing Molly
for something I did.

01:12:59.278 --> 01:13:01.439
- Danny, you were doing your job.
- I don't care!

01:13:03.115 --> 01:13:05.879
Miles doesn't care.

01:13:05.985 --> 01:13:08.954
It's me and him-
an eye for an eye.

01:13:11.490 --> 01:13:13.890
- Danny.
- I was three feet- I was three feet away.

01:13:13.993 --> 01:13:15.893
And I couldn't make a move.

01:13:15.995 --> 01:13:19.226
Stop. Just stop it, man.
You won the round.

01:13:19.331 --> 01:13:23.165
Most importantly, you bought us some time.
And now I got a name.

01:13:23.269 --> 01:13:25.863
- Remember the convict who wanted to cut a deal?
- Yeah.

01:13:25.971 --> 01:13:29.600
He said Miles played chess every day in the
prison yard with a guy named Anthony Deluso.

01:13:29.708 --> 01:13:34.338
Best part? Deluso got paroled three weeks
before the prison break, and he's in town.

01:13:34.446 --> 01:13:36.778
Jansen's on his way to get the address
from his P.O. right now.

01:13:36.882 --> 01:13:39.612
- What the hell you doin' here?
- I knew my boy needed me.

01:13:39.718 --> 01:13:43.484
Wait, wait. Here we go.

01:13:43.589 --> 01:13:46.456
Go for Hank. Yeah.

01:13:46.559 --> 01:13:48.652
Okay, tell Phelps
I'll meet him there in 10 minutes.

01:13:48.761 --> 01:13:51.730
- Bingo. 212 Perdido.
- You got him.

01:13:51.831 --> 01:13:53.432
We're finally gettin' ahead
of this son of a bitch.

01:13:53.433 --> 01:13:53.924
<i>I told you.</i>

01:13:54.033 --> 01:13:56.558
I told you I wasn't gonna let you down.

01:13:57.603 --> 01:13:59.400
- All right, bro.
- Hank.

01:13:59.505 --> 01:14:02.941
- Yo.
- Be careful.

01:14:03.042 --> 01:14:04.942
When am I not?

01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:11.711
Hey.

01:14:11.817 --> 01:14:14.285
You know you can't do this alone.
All right?

01:14:14.386 --> 01:14:17.480
<i>Listen to me, Danny.</i>
<i>I'm not gonna ask you to stop.</i>

01:14:17.590 --> 01:14:20.115
I'm just gonna ask you to let me help you.

01:14:20.226 --> 01:14:22.854
We do this together,
we can both get what we want.

01:14:22.962 --> 01:14:25.328
Round 8.

01:14:25.431 --> 01:14:27.922
- There's five numbers inside this envelope.
- Let me help you.

01:14:28.033 --> 01:14:29.967
Choose wisely, and the number you dial...

01:14:30.069 --> 01:14:31.661
will win the round without further action.

01:14:31.770 --> 01:14:34.261
Choose poorly, and the number you dial...

01:14:34.373 --> 01:14:36.967
<i>will arm one of four devices</i>
<i>scattered throughout the city.</i>

01:14:37.076 --> 01:14:40.603
<i>You now have 60 seconds.</i>
<i>If you refuse to dial in that allotted time...</i>

01:14:40.713 --> 01:14:43.841
<i>all four will be activated</i>
<i>and you'll have yourself quite an adventure.</i>

01:14:43.949 --> 01:14:46.577
<i>- Good luck.</i>
- Let's run these through the local directory.

01:14:46.685 --> 01:14:48.983
No directory.
They're devices, not locations.

01:14:49.088 --> 01:14:51.522
That doesn't make any sense.
It's gotta be a code then.

01:14:51.624 --> 01:14:55.025
Okay, let's try it.

01:14:55.127 --> 01:14:58.619
<i>Text. They're text messages.</i>
<i>The first one's city hall.</i>

01:14:58.731 --> 01:15:01.097
All right.

01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:03.668
Second one is the convention center.

01:15:03.769 --> 01:15:06.294
Danny, we got less than 10 seconds.
We got three numbers left.

01:15:06.405 --> 01:15:09.738
You gotta pick one.

01:15:09.842 --> 01:15:13.608
Sorry, Danny, you lose.
And now Round 9 is gonna be so much fun.

01:15:15.748 --> 01:15:20.276
<i>Very shortly, Streetcar 907 will enter</i>
<i>the downtown area on Canal Street.</i>

01:15:20.386 --> 01:15:23.480
<i>You've just disarmed the brakes</i>
<i>and the communication radio.</i>

01:15:23.589 --> 01:15:25.784
<i>Your task is simply stop the streetcar...</i>

01:15:25.891 --> 01:15:27.791
before it smashes
through the end of the line...

01:15:27.893 --> 01:15:30.361
<i>and everything else in its path.</i>

01:15:30.462 --> 01:15:33.022
Let's take that one.
Come on. Let's go.

01:15:44.810 --> 01:15:48.371
This is Special Agent Ray Santiago of the F.B.I.
I have an emergency.

01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:52.883
Streetcar 907 has lost its brakes
and is speeding toward the riverfront.

01:15:52.985 --> 01:15:55.604
Keep following the 10.
We'll intersect them at Canal.

01:15:55.605 --> 01:15:55.749
Yeah.

01:15:55.854 --> 01:15:58.152
No, this is not a prank phone call.

01:15:58.257 --> 01:16:00.851
My name is Special Agent Ray Santiago
of the F.B.I.

01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:04.225
<i>- I need to talk to somebody that can help-</i>

01:16:05.965 --> 01:16:08.092
She put me on hold.

01:16:22.715 --> 01:16:24.706
<i>- Come on, come on. Pick up the phone.</i>

01:16:25.784 --> 01:16:27.843
<i>They're playing Barry Manilow.</i>

01:16:29.221 --> 01:16:31.416
<i>Pick up the phone!</i>

01:16:31.523 --> 01:16:33.582
No, no. We're on our way
to intercept right now.

01:16:33.692 --> 01:16:37.685
Is there anyone there
that can help us make this decision?

01:16:37.796 --> 01:16:40.196
Shut down the power. You shut down
the power, the streetcar comes to a stop.

01:16:40.299 --> 01:16:42.699
Can't you guys just shut down the power?

01:16:42.801 --> 01:16:46.066
Miss, one more time for the cheap seats.
This is not a prank phone call.

01:16:49.742 --> 01:16:53.143
- Unit 23. You guys in position?
- All clear along the perimeter.

01:16:53.245 --> 01:16:55.611
- We got four units waiting around the corner.
- Copy that.

01:16:55.714 --> 01:16:58.410
Let's see who's home.

01:17:06.358 --> 01:17:09.293
<i>Step right up!
Ring the bell and get a prize!</i>

01:17:26.578 --> 01:17:31.777
- Streetcar 907 to Dispatch. Come in.
<i>- What's going on?</i>

01:17:31.884 --> 01:17:34.079
Streetcar 907.
Does anyone hear me?

01:17:37.589 --> 01:17:40.922
- How fast you think that thing's goin'?
- 30 tons of metal going downhill?

01:17:41.026 --> 01:17:43.153
- Forty?
- Probably 50.

01:17:48.233 --> 01:17:50.463
Will somebody please pick up
the goddamn phone!

01:18:07.219 --> 01:18:09.483
<i>Target is heading
out the back door.</i>

01:18:09.588 --> 01:18:11.954
- Do you want me to take him?
- Negative.

01:18:12.057 --> 01:18:13.991
Negative. Suspect is on the move.

01:18:14.093 --> 01:18:17.119
Let's see where he's going.
Phelps and I will follow him.

01:18:27.506 --> 01:18:29.997
Aren't we going too fast?
I think we'd better hang on.

01:18:37.316 --> 01:18:41.377
Let us out!

01:18:41.487 --> 01:18:44.081
Danny, unless we cut the power,
that thing's not gonna stop.

01:18:44.189 --> 01:18:47.090
I got an idea.

01:18:54.833 --> 01:18:56.562
Danny, what are you doin'?

01:19:09.481 --> 01:19:10.573
Danny?

01:19:26.965 --> 01:19:31.265
Keep it straight
and keep your foot on the brake.

01:19:41.380 --> 01:19:43.473
Are you outta your damn mind?

01:19:43.582 --> 01:19:45.482
Maybe.

01:19:58.263 --> 01:20:00.561
Danny! Look out!

01:20:01.500 --> 01:20:03.559
Whoa!

01:20:11.009 --> 01:20:12.499
Get back!

01:20:18.116 --> 01:20:21.313
<i>It's out of control.
I've tried the brake.</i>

01:20:21.420 --> 01:20:23.650
Help me! Harder!

01:20:26.558 --> 01:20:30.153
Harder! It's jammed!

01:20:30.262 --> 01:20:32.958
Open the door.
I'll try to cut the power from the roof.

01:20:33.065 --> 01:20:35.363
What's he doing?

01:21:01.827 --> 01:21:03.124
Whoa!

01:21:31.156 --> 01:21:34.990
<i>All units, suspect is entering</i>
<i>the Dixie welding factory on Fitzpatrick.</i>

01:21:35.093 --> 01:21:36.993
Wait for my "Go."

01:21:53.278 --> 01:21:56.179
- Didn't work.
- Look out! Look out! Look out!

01:22:29.681 --> 01:22:31.546
<i>What now?</i>

01:22:31.650 --> 01:22:34.619
- We take out the power.
- You are outta your damn mind.

01:22:36.355 --> 01:22:39.449
- You ever jump out of a moving car before?
- Not by choice.

01:23:02.914 --> 01:23:08.250
- It's still goin' too fast! Get down!
- Move! Move!

01:23:08.353 --> 01:23:10.617
<i>- Get outta the way!</i>
- Outta the way! Move! Move! Move!

01:23:10.722 --> 01:23:13.748
<i>- Get down!</i>
- Get outta the way!

01:23:13.859 --> 01:23:16.987
Move! Move!

01:23:17.095 --> 01:23:19.586
<i>- Move! Move! Move!</i>
- Everybody outta the way!

01:23:19.698 --> 01:23:22.667
Get down!

01:23:41.420 --> 01:23:46.050
<i>- Everybody all right?</i>

01:23:49.995 --> 01:23:53.556
- You guys all right?
<i>- Thank God!</i>

01:23:53.665 --> 01:23:55.792
<i>- Is everybody okay?</i>
<i>- You okay, man?</i>

01:24:11.783 --> 01:24:13.683
<i>- Yeah?</i>
- We're here.

01:24:13.785 --> 01:24:15.753
<i>I'm gettin' the truck now.</i>

01:24:26.347 --> 01:24:28.611
Is she okay? You okay, darlin'?

01:24:28.716 --> 01:24:30.616
- Yeah, she's okay.
- Yeah?

01:24:32.702 --> 01:24:35.262
That'd be great. That's a great idea.
Why don't you guys go ahead and do that.

01:24:35.371 --> 01:24:37.271
Thank you.

01:24:38.841 --> 01:24:40.900
They're gonna shut off the power.

01:24:48.051 --> 01:24:50.019
This is gettin' a little too easy, Miles.

01:24:50.119 --> 01:24:52.087
What, are you gettin' soft on me?

01:24:52.188 --> 01:24:54.179
How about you give me something
that's gonna be a challenge?

01:24:54.290 --> 01:24:56.190
You sound pretty pleased
with yourself, Danny.

01:24:56.292 --> 01:24:58.192
Why? Because you stopped the trolley...

01:24:58.294 --> 01:25:01.058
<i>or because you went ahead</i>
<i>with your own round?</i>

01:25:01.164 --> 01:25:03.064
Very admirable. Okay.

01:25:03.166 --> 01:25:06.761
<i>- Welding factory. Second floor hallway.</i>

01:25:06.869 --> 01:25:09.235
<i>If Round 10 is your best friend</i>
<i>takin' Anthony Deluso...</i>

01:25:09.338 --> 01:25:12.899
then Round 11
is me taking your best friend.

01:25:24.987 --> 01:25:25.541
Hank, pick up.

01:25:25.542 --> 01:25:27.478
The person
you are calling is not-

01:25:27.590 --> 01:25:29.751
- It's going to voice mail.
- You all right?

01:25:32.662 --> 01:25:35.563
<i>You are persistent.</i>

01:25:35.665 --> 01:25:37.895
Shit.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:41.834
<i>Attaboy.</i>

01:25:41.938 --> 01:25:44.202
<i>You honestly didn't think</i>
<i>a man like Miles...</i>

01:25:44.307 --> 01:25:47.242
wouldn't have a plan
for something like this?

01:25:52.548 --> 01:25:55.108
Whatever the plan is,
apparently you're not part of it.

01:25:56.452 --> 01:25:57.419
Bitch.

01:26:06.196 --> 01:26:08.164
<i>I don't have anything, man.</i>

01:26:08.265 --> 01:26:10.699
<i>I got somebody on the phone.</i>
<i>I'm trying to get you a straight answer.</i>

01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:12.495
- Nobody's got anything.
- How can you not get a straight answer?

01:26:12.602 --> 01:26:14.570
Miles knew about it.
He knew about everything.

01:26:14.671 --> 01:26:17.265
He knew about Hank. He knew about Deluso.
He was at the warehouse.

01:26:17.374 --> 01:26:20.605
- I hear what you're sayin'.
- It's been a half hour. Something, anything.

01:26:20.710 --> 01:26:22.473
<i>Danny.</i>

01:26:22.579 --> 01:26:24.342
There was an explosion at the factory.

01:26:24.447 --> 01:26:27.848
There are firefighters on the scene now,
but Hank was inside.

01:26:27.951 --> 01:26:30.010
There's no way he could've made it.

01:26:31.888 --> 01:26:33.981
I'm sorry.

01:26:40.730 --> 01:26:42.994
Danny, wait.
Danny, wait, wait.

01:26:43.099 --> 01:26:46.398
- Get off of me!
- Hey.

01:26:46.503 --> 01:26:49.370
Okay, look, three years ago...

01:26:49.472 --> 01:26:53.568
Miles stole three Stingers
from a U.S. military shipment in Iraq.

01:26:53.677 --> 01:26:56.237
We tracked him to Pakistan.
But the day the deal went down...

01:26:56.346 --> 01:26:59.509
I lost Miles and I lost the guns.

01:26:59.616 --> 01:27:01.641
Two days later, one of those Stingers...

01:27:01.751 --> 01:27:04.481
shot down a 747 out of Islamabad.

01:27:04.587 --> 01:27:09.024
This was the only thing
I could find intact in the rubble.

01:27:12.095 --> 01:27:14.757
What I'm saying is I made a mistake here.

01:27:14.864 --> 01:27:16.923
I forgot why I carry this.
This isn't about Miles.

01:27:17.033 --> 01:27:20.264
This is about the people he's hurt
and the ones he's gonna hurt.

01:27:26.843 --> 01:27:29.778
- Guys, I'm never gonna see her again.
- Don't say that.

01:27:29.879 --> 01:27:31.972
Yes, you are.
We got one round left.

01:27:32.082 --> 01:27:35.677
And I know Miles better
than any person alive. Let me help you.

01:27:45.428 --> 01:27:47.157
<i>#Oh, Danny boy #</i>

01:27:47.263 --> 01:27:50.790
<i># The pipes</i>
<i>the pipes are calling ##</i>

01:27:50.900 --> 01:27:53.630
Sorry about the delay, Danny.

01:27:53.737 --> 01:27:56.399
<i>But I think that we're just about ready</i>
<i>for our grand finale.</i>

01:27:56.506 --> 01:27:59.270
It is Round 12, and, this time...

01:27:59.376 --> 01:28:01.241
we won't be goin'
to the judges' scorecards.

01:28:01.344 --> 01:28:05.041
In 17 minutes, it will be exactly one year
since Erica's death...

01:28:05.148 --> 01:28:09.244
<i>and I have to ask-</i>
<i>will Molly suffer a similar fate?</i>

01:28:12.489 --> 01:28:14.821
- Miles, you don't have to do this.
- Too late.

01:28:14.924 --> 01:28:16.892
You've done well to survive this long.

01:28:16.993 --> 01:28:19.461
Now all you have to do is find her.

01:28:19.562 --> 01:28:22.395
She has a touch phone
strapped to her chest...

01:28:22.499 --> 01:28:24.660
along with some other,
more explosive items.

01:28:24.768 --> 01:28:27.965
Except this time, only your thumbprint...

01:28:28.071 --> 01:28:30.505
only your touch, can stop the timer.

01:28:32.375 --> 01:28:34.275
Tell me where she is.

01:28:34.377 --> 01:28:36.277
Are you sorry for what you've done?

01:28:40.517 --> 01:28:42.815
Yes, Miles, I'm sorry.

01:28:42.919 --> 01:28:46.082
Then perhaps maybe you should
pay her a visit, tell her so yourself.

01:28:46.189 --> 01:28:48.623
It's been fun, Danny, but game over.

01:28:51.194 --> 01:28:53.128
Pay Erica a visit?

01:28:54.697 --> 01:28:57.666
<i>It's the cemetery. Where is she buried?</i>
<i>Where is she buried?</i>

01:29:00.804 --> 01:29:03.466
<i>I need you to pull the cemetery records</i>
<i>of all Orleans Parish.</i>

01:29:03.573 --> 01:29:06.406
<i>Last name: Kessen.</i>
<i>K-E-S-S-E-N.</i>

01:29:06.509 --> 01:29:08.670
<i>First name: Erica.</i>
<i>That's with a "C."</i>

01:29:08.778 --> 01:29:11.144
This is Ray Santiago of the F.B.I.
I need a police escort.

01:29:11.247 --> 01:29:14.978
<i>We are Canal and Royal</i>
<i>heading out of the C.B.D.</i>

01:29:15.084 --> 01:29:17.712
<i>Metairie Cemetery.</i>

01:29:17.821 --> 01:29:19.755
<i>Tell whoever gets there-</i>
<i>don't touch anything.</i>

01:29:19.856 --> 01:29:22.290
- I'm the only one that can defuse that bomb.
- We know, Danny.

01:29:33.670 --> 01:29:37.367
<i>- Anybody on the scene yet?</i>
- They're arriving now, but remember, this is Miles.

01:29:37.474 --> 01:29:39.169
The cemetery might just be the first step.

01:29:40.086 --> 01:29:41.766
That's bullshit! Why have I
been doing this shit all day?

01:29:41.878 --> 01:29:43.812
If he wanted to kill us,
he should've done it when he had the chance.

01:29:43.913 --> 01:29:45.813
Danny, your phone.

01:29:47.183 --> 01:29:49.310
- Yeah?
- Danny. Chuck Jansen.

01:29:49.419 --> 01:29:52.320
Two things Hank had me working on-
they're not making any sense.

01:29:52.422 --> 01:29:54.481
<i>I ran a trace</i>
<i>on all five numbers from earlier.</i>

01:29:54.591 --> 01:29:58.357
<i>They were all connected to the device</i>
<i>under the streetcar. All five numbers.</i>

01:29:58.461 --> 01:30:01.328
Not only that, Miles had remote cameras
in the elevator shaft.

01:30:01.431 --> 01:30:05.231
<i>We pulled the tapes.</i>
<i>He blew the device early, Danny.</i>

01:30:05.335 --> 01:30:07.030
You still had five seconds to save Willie.

01:30:07.136 --> 01:30:10.071
Like I said, it was the last thing
Hank had me working on, but-

01:30:13.610 --> 01:30:15.635
Danny, Danny. Danny, why are we stopping?

01:30:18.815 --> 01:30:23.252
- Willie was always gonna die.
- What are you talking about?

01:30:23.353 --> 01:30:25.378
Miles had security cameras
in the elevator.

01:30:25.488 --> 01:30:27.456
Saw I was gonna save him
and blew the charge early.

01:30:27.557 --> 01:30:32.221
<i>And all those numbers-all five of them-</i>
<i>were connected to the same streetcar.</i>

01:30:32.328 --> 01:30:34.853
You already told me once, George.

01:30:34.964 --> 01:30:36.864
I arrested this guy.
I don't even know him.

01:30:36.966 --> 01:30:39.696
<i>This is your guy.</i>
<i>What am I missing?</i>

01:30:41.504 --> 01:30:43.369
Joshua.

01:30:43.473 --> 01:30:46.806
- Every time he plays, what does Miles want?
<i>- He wants to win.</i>

01:30:46.910 --> 01:30:49.401
Miles wants to be the guy
that nobody can beat.

01:30:49.512 --> 01:30:52.913
The deal with Samuel and Joshua. He went
to a lot of trouble to get some revenge.

01:30:53.016 --> 01:30:55.576
- But what else did we find in the car?
- Diamonds.

01:30:55.685 --> 01:30:57.778
He steals from the U.S. military,
he sells it for a profit.

01:30:57.887 --> 01:31:00.913
He's had Molly for over three and a half hours.
Not once has he mentioned ransom.

01:31:01.024 --> 01:31:03.424
- This isn't about revenge.
- It is about the money.

01:31:03.526 --> 01:31:07.986
Ray, give me all the information we got
on the security guard from the hotel.

01:31:16.940 --> 01:31:20.774
Willie Dumaine has a second job
as a Homewood Security guard.

01:31:23.580 --> 01:31:25.480
Hi. I'm Tom Baxter.

01:31:25.582 --> 01:31:28.574
Office called,
said Willie Dumaine's a no-show.

01:31:28.685 --> 01:31:31.745
I'm pickin' up his shift.
Thank you.

01:31:33.456 --> 01:31:35.356
<i>This guy's had us runnin' all day.</i>

01:31:35.458 --> 01:31:37.824
For one second,
we've just gotta stop and think.

01:31:37.927 --> 01:31:40.293
- Today, what did I actually do?
- Does this even matter?

01:31:40.396 --> 01:31:42.330
You're still the only one
who can deactivate that bomb.

01:31:42.432 --> 01:31:44.195
He took my house.
He took Molly.

01:31:44.300 --> 01:31:47.030
That's what he did to get you to play.
What else happened at the hotel?

01:31:49.439 --> 01:31:53.273
<i>He blew the gas lines.</i>
<i>They evacuated three city blocks.</i>

01:31:53.376 --> 01:31:56.311
Three city blocks?
Get me a list of those buildings.

01:32:10.259 --> 01:32:13.422
<i>Any one of those numbers-any one</i>
<i>would've gone back to that very streetcar.</i>

01:32:13.529 --> 01:32:16.020
- I had to stop the streetcar.
<i>- No, no, no. You had to cut the power.</i>

01:32:16.132 --> 01:32:18.464
After Katrina, when the power
was out all over the city-

01:32:18.568 --> 01:32:21.401
Homewood Security comes in
to move all the unprotected cash.

01:32:21.504 --> 01:32:23.995
Wait a second.
What was that last one?

01:32:24.107 --> 01:32:27.201
Holy shit. One of the buildings
that we evacuated...

01:32:27.310 --> 01:32:30.302
is a temporary holding facility
for the Bureau of Engraving and Printing.

01:32:32.615 --> 01:32:34.549
That's the goddamn mint.

01:32:45.428 --> 01:32:47.396
<i>Our backup generator's</i>
<i>gonna run out at midnight.</i>

01:32:54.203 --> 01:32:57.934
<i>Fed's been pullin' all the old hundreds</i>
<i>and fifties out of circulation.</i>

01:32:58.041 --> 01:33:00.202
<i>That's the entire Southeast allotment.</i>

01:33:00.309 --> 01:33:02.607
- Total's just over-
- $100 million?

01:33:04.213 --> 01:33:06.613
<i>Hey, Ray, you go with SWAT to the mint...</i>

01:33:06.716 --> 01:33:08.616
and you shut everything down-
all cars, all pedestrians.

01:33:08.718 --> 01:33:10.447
You stop it,
and you lock it in the Quarter.

01:33:10.553 --> 01:33:12.578
We got eight minutes
to get you to the cemetery.

01:33:12.689 --> 01:33:15.180
- Don't you want Miles?
- Not till we get Molly.

01:33:20.963 --> 01:33:23.227
Thanks.

01:33:23.332 --> 01:33:25.800
Thank me when it's over.

01:33:58.701 --> 01:34:02.000
Tell me something. If Miles knows
we're shutting down the city...

01:34:02.105 --> 01:34:04.005
how's he getting the money out?

01:34:08.077 --> 01:34:11.308
<i>Only emergency vehicles are leaving the Quarter.</i>
<i>Miles isn't gettin' anywhere.</i>

01:34:11.414 --> 01:34:13.814
<i>See, in your time constraints...</i>

01:34:13.916 --> 01:34:16.248
you might want to use
the fire truck for this one.

01:34:17.620 --> 01:34:19.485
<i>- Hey.</i>

01:34:19.589 --> 01:34:22.114
Hey, what are you doin'?
Molly's at the cemetery.

01:34:22.225 --> 01:34:25.592
Nope. That asshole even told me
to wear the hat and use the siren.

01:35:00.997 --> 01:35:04.398
Everything I did today had a purpose.
From the time Molly walked out the door...

01:35:04.500 --> 01:35:06.400
<i>there isn't a thing I did today</i>
<i>that Miles didn't plan.</i>

01:35:06.502 --> 01:35:09.562
<i>He makes sure I wreck the fire truck</i>
<i>so he could steal it.</i>

01:35:09.672 --> 01:35:11.503
<i>He threatens my brother</i>
<i>so I'm not thinking straight.</i>

01:35:11.607 --> 01:35:13.905
<i>He shows me Molly</i>
<i>to keep me in the game. It's obvious.</i>

01:35:14.010 --> 01:35:17.377
If she's still alive,
Molly's his ticket out.

01:35:22.318 --> 01:35:24.650
I need to speak with hospital security.

01:35:31.761 --> 01:35:34.229
Wake up, baby.
We're here.

01:35:59.322 --> 01:36:02.018
Almost finished.

01:36:02.124 --> 01:36:05.685
You do like I say, and we will both
live happily ever after.

01:36:11.234 --> 01:36:15.762
Now, where are those body bags?

01:36:17.940 --> 01:36:19.805
<i>Attention, all hospital personnel.</i>

01:36:19.909 --> 01:36:22.469
<i>Explosion reported outside east wing.</i>

01:36:22.578 --> 01:36:24.478
<i>Please report to your stations.</i>

01:36:24.580 --> 01:36:26.775
<i>Attention, all hospital personnel.</i>

01:36:26.883 --> 01:36:28.783
<i>Explosion reported outside the east wing.</i>

01:36:28.885 --> 01:36:32.150
<i>Please report to your stations, stat.</i>

01:36:35.658 --> 01:36:38.422
<i>It's an explosion.
They need us down there.</i>

01:36:38.527 --> 01:36:40.791
No, I'm not sure.
I'm going there right now.

01:37:13.296 --> 01:37:16.925
Cordon off University Hospital.
Let nobody in or out.

01:37:25.675 --> 01:37:27.870
Think you can fly us
to Tahiti in this thing, yeah?

01:37:30.613 --> 01:37:32.581
Get in.

01:37:35.785 --> 01:37:37.446
They're here.

01:37:40.156 --> 01:37:43.523
<i>She's taking off.</i>

01:37:47.496 --> 01:37:49.691
Eagle 1,
<i>is that you up there?</i>

01:37:49.799 --> 01:37:52.199
You have not been authorized for takeoff.

01:37:52.301 --> 01:37:53.962
<i>Eagle 1 requesting-</i>

01:37:54.070 --> 01:37:55.697
Fly!

01:38:13.489 --> 01:38:16.219
You're not stalling on me,
darlin', are ya?

01:38:16.325 --> 01:38:18.259
If you wanna fly this thing, you go ahead.

01:38:18.361 --> 01:38:21.091
Yeah, well, how about you teach me?

01:38:47.857 --> 01:38:50.621
Take us up!
Take us up!

01:38:50.726 --> 01:38:52.785
- You all right?
- Go!

01:38:52.895 --> 01:38:54.692
Make a good decision.

01:39:06.475 --> 01:39:08.773
Danny!

01:39:12.681 --> 01:39:14.478
You're gonna be fun to kill.

01:39:18.054 --> 01:39:20.284
- Uh!
- Oh!

01:39:33.536 --> 01:39:35.504
<i>Danny, he's got a gun!</i>

01:39:50.753 --> 01:39:52.516
<i>We're losing hydraulic pressure.</i>

01:39:52.621 --> 01:39:55.749
<i>I need to find a place to put her down.</i>

01:39:55.858 --> 01:39:57.609
<i>Can you make it back
to the hospital?</i>

01:39:57.610 --> 01:39:57.792
Negative.

01:39:57.893 --> 01:40:01.852
I need to stabilize flight controls,
or else we are going down.

01:40:01.964 --> 01:40:05.593
<i>Gun, Danny!</i>
<i>He's going for the gun!</i>

01:40:09.105 --> 01:40:11.130
<i>Mayday! Mayday! This is Eagle 1!</i>

01:40:18.247 --> 01:40:21.114
Tell me you can still land this thing.

01:40:21.217 --> 01:40:22.946
<i>He busted the hydraulics.</i>
<i>We're going down, Danny.</i>

01:40:23.052 --> 01:40:24.781
<i>Please confirm status, Eagle 1!</i>

01:40:24.887 --> 01:40:26.787
<i>Damn it! Danny!</i>

01:40:31.994 --> 01:40:34.690
- I gotta set her down.
- Please confirm status, <i>Eagle 1!</i>

01:40:47.842 --> 01:40:49.901
<i>Clear emergency landing.</i>

01:40:50.011 --> 01:40:51.740
<i>Danny!</i>

01:40:53.581 --> 01:40:55.254
<i>Danny! Talk to me!</i>

01:40:55.289 --> 01:40:59.123
Knockout, Danny! This time,
you're not gonna get saved by the bell.

01:40:59.226 --> 01:41:00.716
Hold on, Danny!
Hold on!

01:41:10.404 --> 01:41:13.202
<i>Danny! We're out of time!</i>

01:41:13.307 --> 01:41:17.710
- I can't control it anymore!
<i>- Eagle 1,</i> this is Tower. Stand by.

01:41:17.812 --> 01:41:19.780
You lose!

01:41:19.880 --> 01:41:23.714
<i>Danny, strap in!</i>
<i>We're going down!</i>

01:41:23.818 --> 01:41:27.276
- Eagle 1, <i>you are cleared for emergency landing.</i>
<i>- Officer Fisher!</i>

01:41:27.388 --> 01:41:29.185
One last move.

01:41:29.290 --> 01:41:32.453
Remember the vest from the bus?

01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:35.996
- Knockout.
- No!

01:41:36.097 --> 01:41:38.531
<i>Oh, my God!</i>
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

01:41:38.633 --> 01:41:41.693
<i>Get in the seat!</i>
<i>I can still put her down.</i>

01:41:41.802 --> 01:41:44.498
- Danny, strap in.
- Not in time.

01:41:44.605 --> 01:41:46.505
<i>Yes, I can!</i>

01:41:46.607 --> 01:41:48.074
- What are you doing?
- We gotta get out of here.

01:41:48.175 --> 01:41:50.507
<i>No. What are you do-</i>
<i>No! No!</i>

01:41:50.611 --> 01:41:52.806
Do you trust me?

01:41:52.913 --> 01:41:54.972
Yes.

01:41:55.082 --> 01:41:56.879
Come on.

01:41:59.453 --> 01:42:01.421
You land it!

01:42:01.522 --> 01:42:02.853
Bitch.

01:43:03.166 --> 01:43:05.999
I never doubted you.

01:43:06.102 --> 01:43:09.469
That makes one of us.

01:43:13.643 --> 01:43:16.578
What hurts?

01:43:16.679 --> 01:43:19.170
Everything.

01:43:23.119 --> 01:43:26.577
Oh!

01:43:26.689 --> 01:43:30.318
<i># Yeah, and I'll tell you why, baby #</i>

01:43:30.427 --> 01:43:32.554
<i># My love is growin'#</i>
<i># My love is growin'#</i>

01:43:34.597 --> 01:43:37.566
Helicopter explosion.
No big deal.

01:43:39.436 --> 01:43:42.599
Let's get you home.

01:43:44.841 --> 01:43:46.809
About the house.

01:43:52.916 --> 01:43:57.853
<i># Again I'm dreamin' of you #</i>

01:44:01.357 --> 01:44:07.193

01:44:09.799 --> 01:44:15.829

01:44:18.308 --> 01:44:24.679
<i># When I wake</i>
<i>it fades to silence #</i>

01:44:24.781 --> 01:44:28.945

01:44:29.052 --> 01:44:31.384
<i># And a thousand days #</i>

01:44:31.488 --> 01:44:35.322
