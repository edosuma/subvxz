Name is Logan Winters.

working a case on the guy.

10:47.168 --> 10:48.517

Steve, what's ATF's interest
in Logan Winters?

10:50.824 --> 10:52.390

Winters was arrested

10:52.477 --> 10:55.002
by our New York office for
a federal weapons violation.

10:55.089 --> 10:57.004

has a stiff sentence.

10:57.091 --> 10:58.658

10:58.745 --> 11:01.399

convicted,

11:01.486 --> 11:02.966

the case on appeal.

11:03.053 --> 11:04.881

11:04.968 --> 11:06.622
