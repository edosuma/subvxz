00:08.641 --> 00:10.244
You want to trip,
I'll bring it to ya ?

00:10.278 --> 00:13.583
Frylock and I'm on top,
rock you like a cop ?

00:13.616 --> 00:16.788
Meatwad, you're up next
with your knock-knock ?

00:21.162 --> 00:23.633
Drivin' in my car,
livin' like a star ?

00:23.666 --> 00:27.306
Ice on my fingers and my toes,
and I'm a Taurus ?

00:31.579 --> 00:35.520
Make the homeys say ho
and the girlies want to scream ?

00:37.123 --> 00:41.262
Make the homeys say ho
and the girlies want to scream ?

00:41.295 --> 00:43.099
<i>Aqua Teen Hunger Force.</i>

00:43.133 --> 00:45.703
Number One in the 'hood, g.

00:45.737 --> 00:47.072
Hey, here's one --

00:47.105 --> 00:48.875
"Looking for dollars?

00:48.908 --> 00:51.146
Are you gullible --
and stupid?

00:51.179 --> 00:52.247
As hell?

00:52.281 --> 00:55.253
You may qualify to be part
of our dangerous experiment.

00:55.286 --> 00:57.590
Bring your resume,
wallet, social security,

00:57.623 --> 01:01.997
ATM and all credit cards
to Carl's car wash.

01:02.030 --> 01:03.540
Minorities need
not apply,

01:03.573 --> 01:07.346
or we gonn' sue
your balls to the wall.

01:08.515 --> 01:09.449
That sounds
promising.

01:09.482 --> 01:12.054
That job is perfect for you!

01:17.663 --> 01:20.034
? Come on, get your car wash!
Get it on ?

01:20.067 --> 01:22.438
? Come on,
get your car wash on ?

01:25.209 --> 01:29.383
Hot dog, we want you
to get your car washed!

01:33.322 --> 01:35.059
Hey, look at this igloo!

01:35.092 --> 01:38.330
Now go on
and get your car washed!

01:38.364 --> 01:39.767
Come on, y'all.

01:39.800 --> 01:42.872
Somebody get
a car wash.

01:42.905 --> 01:44.508
Thanks for the beverage!

01:44.541 --> 01:47.313
<i>Man on PA: Meatwad, report to Brain Quarters.</i>

01:47.346 --> 01:49.750
<i>Meatwad, report
to Brain Quarters.</i>

01:49.784 --> 01:51.620
Oh, shoot.

01:51.653 --> 01:53.856
I'm in it now.

01:55.894 --> 01:58.899
We've been open six months

01:58.932 --> 02:00.935
and had not
one customer.

02:02.478 --> 02:04.381
You don't think
it's --

02:04.414 --> 02:06.184
it ain't my dancing,
is it?

02:06.217 --> 02:08.520
Yes, it is
your dancing.

02:08.555 --> 02:11.025
Show me your shapes.

02:11.059 --> 02:12.327
Oh, I got a ton.

02:12.361 --> 02:14.297
Here, check
this out.

02:14.330 --> 02:16.067
Hot Dog.

02:16.101 --> 02:17.269
Igloo.

02:17.303 --> 02:20.108
Igloo.

02:20.141 --> 02:22.010
Hot Dog.

02:22.043 --> 02:24.515
Igloo.

02:24.548 --> 02:25.984
Igloo.

02:26.017 --> 02:26.919
Igloo.

02:26.952 --> 02:28.421
Those are not enough shapes!

02:28.454 --> 02:31.559
No one will wash their car here
because of you!

02:31.593 --> 02:34.131
I got more shapes.
I mean, come on.

02:34.164 --> 02:37.503
I know
all sorts of shapes.

02:38.972 --> 02:42.277
I better go home and
practice me some shapes.

02:42.311 --> 02:44.080
Yes, you will!

02:44.114 --> 02:46.852
You better go!
You better go!

02:46.885 --> 02:49.356
Okay, here we go.

02:49.389 --> 02:52.461
Here comes a chair.

02:58.404 --> 02:59.573
Close enough.

02:59.606 --> 03:02.818
What are you doing Meatwad?
Trying to get into shape.

03:02.851 --> 03:05.423
Some other shape other than
hot dog or igloo.

03:05.456 --> 03:07.126
I can't think
of nothing new.

03:07.159 --> 03:10.231
You know, there's more
than just those two shapes?

03:10.264 --> 03:10.965
There is?

03:11.000 --> 03:13.437
Let's try this one.
An octagon.

03:13.470 --> 03:15.206
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:15.239 --> 03:17.176
Like that Chuck Norris
movie?

03:17.210 --> 03:18.712
That ain't
Chuck Norris.

03:18.745 --> 03:20.948
And it's not
an octagan either.

03:20.981 --> 03:22.451
Hey, do Octopussy.

03:22.484 --> 03:24.288
Like this here?

03:24.322 --> 03:26.591
That's what
I'm talking about.

03:26.625 --> 03:28.361
There you go.

03:28.394 --> 03:29.730
You know what?

03:29.763 --> 03:31.700
I gotta go
take a dump.

03:31.734 --> 03:32.769
I don't know.

03:32.802 --> 03:36.174
All these shapes just
freakin' hurtin'
my kidneys.

03:36.207 --> 03:38.712
Why can't people
just like me for me?

03:38.746 --> 03:40.648
But sadly, no one does.

03:40.682 --> 03:44.020
Not even the president.
He's a great guy, though.

03:44.054 --> 03:46.324
If I don't come up
with some new shapes,

03:46.358 --> 03:47.626
I'm gonna lose
my damn job.

03:47.660 --> 03:50.298
He says he don't need me.
I be the first to go.

03:50.331 --> 03:51.667
I have an idea.

03:51.700 --> 03:54.672
That will cost you
$20 dollars.

03:56.074 --> 03:58.678
What do you want?

03:59.280 --> 04:00.915
Shake:
Get your car washed.

04:00.948 --> 04:02.658
? Get your car washed
uh, uh ?

04:02.691 --> 04:05.430
? Get your car washed
uh, uh ?

04:05.463 --> 04:07.466
Or you a dumbass gonna
get your ass whooped.

04:07.499 --> 04:10.671
? Or you a dumbass gonna
get your ass whooped ?

04:10.704 --> 04:12.307
Right here and now!

04:12.342 --> 04:13.409
Right here and now.

04:13.443 --> 04:16.449
Really emphasize the "now."
You're mad with this guy.

04:16.482 --> 04:18.351
Right here and now, boy.

04:18.385 --> 04:21.156
Now shove him.
Physically.

04:21.190 --> 04:22.724
That's not necessary.

04:22.758 --> 04:24.963
Very thoughtful, but, uh,
you know, up yours.

04:24.996 --> 04:28.469
'Cause 2 Wycked don't
need no wash right now.

04:28.502 --> 04:30.839
I just hit it
with a Chamois.

04:30.873 --> 04:33.443
She's gleaming like
the freakin' sun.

04:33.477 --> 04:35.814
Drop the load!

04:37.082 --> 04:39.353
Yeah!

04:40.922 --> 04:43.927
So, can I pencil you in
for an appointment?

04:43.960 --> 04:47.967
Y'all a bunch of dumbasses
gonna get your ass whooped!

04:48.001 --> 04:52.007
Then you go in there
and get your car washed!

04:52.041 --> 04:54.979
Oops! Nice throw, wussy.

04:55.013 --> 04:56.081
Oh, dang it.

04:56.115 --> 04:57.850
Brain: Meatwad,
report to Brain Quarters.

04:57.883 --> 05:00.522
Meatwad, report
to Brain Quarters.

05:00.555 --> 05:01.489
We have a customer!

05:01.523 --> 05:04.602
I repeat, we have
a customer!

05:04.635 --> 05:06.004
Better be free,
little meat man.

05:06.037 --> 05:07.639
Oh, Carl, it is,
believe me.

05:07.674 --> 05:10.378
I want the UV with
the triple foam
protectorant,

05:10.411 --> 05:12.682
and the car
nouveau waxed.
The good stuff.

05:12.715 --> 05:14.851
You just don't
even worry about it.

05:14.886 --> 05:16.822
Just sit back
on that gurney,

05:16.855 --> 05:19.760
and, you know, suck from
that mask, and relax.

05:19.794 --> 05:20.929
All right, then.

05:20.962 --> 05:21.997
This is very
comfortable here.

05:22.030 --> 05:24.335
Wearing a paper gown is
a little off-putting,

05:24.368 --> 05:25.970
but, you know,
I'll go with it.

05:26.004 --> 05:28.842
When we do the interior, we like
to enhance it with an aroma.

05:28.875 --> 05:31.213
Do you have a favorite aroma
you'd like to pick?

05:31.246 --> 05:33.450
We'd love to facilitate that.

05:33.483 --> 05:34.986
You got Pina Colada?

05:35.020 --> 05:37.023
Nah, I'm afraid not, sir.

05:37.056 --> 05:38.926
No Pina Colada.

05:38.959 --> 05:42.332
Okay, how about
Strawberry Boobs?

05:42.365 --> 05:43.934
Nah, we ain't
got that, neither.

05:43.967 --> 05:46.138
What we do have
is Athlete's Foot,

05:46.172 --> 05:49.243
Bloated Beach Cod,
and Stank Breath.

05:49.276 --> 05:52.048
Go through
the list again.

05:52.081 --> 05:53.250
Oh, here we go.

05:53.283 --> 05:56.455
This is the first part of our
patented three-step treatment.

05:58.192 --> 06:01.096
That kinda looks
like you're just sorta
flinging dirt on it.

06:01.129 --> 06:02.939
What it actually is
is Dumpster Juice.

06:02.972 --> 06:06.845
Which is a combination of
rain water and garbage.

06:06.878 --> 06:09.316
Very acetic,
very harsh on your paint job.

06:09.349 --> 06:11.186
And why are
we doing this again?

06:11.220 --> 06:12.355
It's just a pre-coat.

06:12.388 --> 06:14.291
I mean, obviously we need
to prep the outer coat

06:14.325 --> 06:16.528
for, you know,
the cat urine.

06:18.532 --> 06:21.303
And, of course,
the hammers.

06:21.337 --> 06:22.439
What the frick
are you doing?

06:22.472 --> 06:25.510
Hey, Carl, let's lay back down
and relax, okay?

06:26.611 --> 06:29.917
Just allow the mystery gas
to do its work.

06:31.454 --> 06:33.490
And don't worry.
We totally redo the paint.

06:33.523 --> 06:37.163
In a color
of our own choosing.

06:37.196 --> 06:39.400
Yeah, whatever.

06:39.433 --> 06:41.069
I'm easy.

06:41.103 --> 06:42.237
Hello, Carl.

06:42.271 --> 06:44.942
I too, am Carl.

06:44.976 --> 06:48.114
And this is
my son, Carl Jr.

06:49.817 --> 06:52.922
We are all Carls.

06:52.955 --> 06:53.857
Neat.

06:53.891 --> 06:55.527
Yes, yes.

06:55.560 --> 06:58.231
Remove his brain!

07:05.851 --> 07:09.558
I wonder if you can get
the whole thing in your mouth.

07:09.591 --> 07:12.362
Hey Meatwad, how's
the job going?

07:12.395 --> 07:14.298
Um, just okay.

07:14.331 --> 07:17.704
Carl washed his car
there, didn't he?

07:17.737 --> 07:19.907
Yeah, but...

07:19.940 --> 07:20.876
But what?

07:20.909 --> 07:24.182
I'm having some
reservations about this work.

07:24.215 --> 07:26.118
And some nightmares.

07:26.151 --> 07:27.588
Nightmares?

07:27.621 --> 07:29.891
There was a time in my life when
I thought dancing in front
of the car wash

07:29.924 --> 07:32.261
would be the only thing
I'd ever want to do,

07:32.295 --> 07:34.298
but the way
these people wash cars...

07:34.331 --> 07:35.934
I just don't know anymore.

07:35.967 --> 07:39.540
Well, Carl seems
happy with it.

07:41.210 --> 07:42.212
Is he licking it?

07:42.245 --> 07:43.947
Yeah, he's been doing that
all morning, I'm afraid.

07:43.980 --> 07:47.654
You know, snakes --
in the wild, of course --

07:47.687 --> 07:51.159
have to unhinge their jaw
to eat a car.

07:51.192 --> 07:52.762
I think
the trouble with you

07:52.795 --> 07:56.235
is that you have all that
skin around your mouth.

07:56.268 --> 07:56.903
Shake!

07:56.937 --> 07:59.173
What? He's doing it!
Carl?

07:59.206 --> 08:01.143
Carl.

08:01.176 --> 08:02.245
Carl?

08:02.278 --> 08:03.252
Carl.

08:03.287 --> 08:05.291
Oh, no!
Oh, no.

08:05.324 --> 08:06.825
Someone's taken
Carl's brain!

08:06.858 --> 08:09.497
That is what I've been
trying to tell you.

08:09.530 --> 08:12.335
Really? Well, you haven't
been very specific about it!

08:12.368 --> 08:13.705
I know I haven't.

08:13.738 --> 08:15.207
Because they says
if I tell anyone,

08:15.239 --> 08:17.243
I'm gonna lose my job dancing
in front of the car wash.

08:17.276 --> 08:20.950
Well, I'll tell you what, we're
gonna do something about it
right now.

08:20.983 --> 08:23.921
Look here, we can
keep this cool, between us

08:23.954 --> 08:26.659
'cause, look, this the third
job I lost this week.

08:26.692 --> 08:28.061
Come on y'all.

08:28.094 --> 08:29.597
We're gonna go get
us a car wash.

08:29.631 --> 08:33.037
Are you outta your mind?
They take your brain out!

08:33.070 --> 08:33.837
I know that!

08:33.871 --> 08:36.708
They take your brain out
over there.

08:36.743 --> 08:38.445
Here, I got a coupon.

08:38.477 --> 08:40.482
That's okay, Carl.
I got the employee discount.

08:40.515 --> 08:43.587
Free triple foam polish
with UV protectorant.

08:43.620 --> 08:44.889
Come on, Shake.

08:44.922 --> 08:47.527
I'm trying to create
a show here.

08:47.561 --> 08:49.064
I'm a show.

08:49.097 --> 08:52.001
What time
the show come on?

08:53.571 --> 08:57.043
Brain: Brain Slave,
report to Brain Quarters.

08:59.414 --> 09:04.495
Brain Slave, kindly
report to Brain Quarters.

09:07.333 --> 09:08.469
Brain Slave!

09:08.502 --> 09:11.474
The new Brain Slave
refuses to report!

09:11.507 --> 09:13.544
Ain't nothing
but a brain.

09:13.577 --> 09:15.180
As are we,
Son.

09:15.213 --> 09:16.549
And we do our job!

09:16.582 --> 09:17.484
You right, Daddy.
You right!

09:17.517 --> 09:19.720
Go on and fetch
this Brain Slave,

09:19.754 --> 09:23.360
and kindly ask him
to be on bug removal!

09:23.393 --> 09:26.366
Permanently!

09:28.502 --> 09:29.804
Customer, Daddy!

09:29.837 --> 09:31.274
Get my blue
fright wig at once!

09:31.307 --> 09:33.511
Greet them with
a smile, Son.

09:33.544 --> 09:36.048
A hard plastic smile.

09:36.082 --> 09:38.519
We got a free
dashboard cleaning,

09:38.552 --> 09:41.023
get the lint balls
off your car,

09:41.056 --> 09:42.393
free tire shine!

09:42.426 --> 09:44.496
You'll get all that
with a free brain removal.

09:44.529 --> 09:46.900
Carl Brain:
Moron, don't tell them!

09:46.933 --> 09:50.406
I meant to say car wash.

09:50.439 --> 09:51.641
Now gas them!
Quickly!

09:51.674 --> 09:54.846
Look, I just came by to tell you
that I've told the police

09:54.879 --> 09:56.716
about your little brain
operation here.

09:56.750 --> 09:59.354
Yeah, and they didn't
believe us.

09:59.387 --> 10:00.688
No, they didn't.

10:00.722 --> 10:03.367
Then we shall call them
and show them pictures!

10:03.400 --> 10:06.806
That's a good idea,
Daddy.

10:06.839 --> 10:08.476
It is a very good idea.

10:08.509 --> 10:09.277
Where's Carl's brain?

10:09.310 --> 10:12.549
I am Carl Brain.
No, Carl's Brain.

10:12.583 --> 10:13.885
I am Carl Brain.

10:13.918 --> 10:17.557
No, no, no.
Different carl, okay?

10:17.924 --> 10:19.327
I am Carl Brain.

10:19.360 --> 10:21.731
My friend Carl,
his brain!
Behind you.

10:21.764 --> 10:24.804
Is that Carl's Brain?
Over there?

10:24.837 --> 10:25.971
On the expressway?

10:26.006 --> 10:28.775
Beware, for it will
immediately seize you

10:28.810 --> 10:29.977
upon my, command,

10:30.012 --> 10:33.450
and your mind will be
enslaved to forever...

10:33.483 --> 10:36.188
Polish the chrome
at this wash --

10:36.222 --> 10:38.126
car wash.

10:38.159 --> 10:39.593
This is
retarded.

10:39.628 --> 10:41.264
Oh, he called
you retarded, Daddy.

10:41.297 --> 10:43.801
Stop him at once.

10:43.835 --> 10:45.304
From calling me retarded.

10:45.338 --> 10:47.206
Too late, he did it.
He got away.

10:47.241 --> 10:49.510
Go eat your brain
now, Carl.

10:49.544 --> 10:50.913
Dinner time, isn't it?

10:50.947 --> 10:52.215
Oh, look at that.
It's dinner time.

10:52.249 --> 10:53.768
Oh, no, you don't.
Where do you think
you're going?

10:53.768 --> 10:57.664
Home, now get out of here.
We are closed.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.530
We open at 10:00 tomorrow.
