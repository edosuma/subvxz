Hey, where'd this hole
come from?

Ah!

01:15.242 --> 01:16.041
(Laughing)

01:16.043 --> 01:20.546
Phew. I mean,
I knew that wasn't a ghost.

01:20.548 --> 01:22.915
(Air whooshing)

01:29.290 --> 01:31.657
But that's a ghost!

(Hooting)

(Howling)

01:40.601 --> 01:41.166

01:44.238 --> 01:46.205
Oof!

01:46.207 --> 01:47.372
Oof!
(Gasping)

01:47.374 --> 01:49.875
Don't worry, I'm good.

01:49.877 --> 01:54.179
Well, not good at jumping,
but you know what I mean.

01:54.181 --> 01:56.915
(Laughing)

01:56.917 --> 01:58.317
Now it's my turn.

01:58.319 --> 01:59.384
Whoa!

01:59.386 --> 02:01.587
Rocky?
Where'd he go?

02:01.589 --> 02:05.724
Uh, Rubble, did you dig a hole
in the middle of the yard?

02:05.726 --> 02:06.558
I didn't dig that.

02:06.560 --> 02:10.095
I fell in a hole last night too
when I heard the...

02:10.097 --> 02:12.097
Uh... Well, uh...

02:12.099 --> 02:14.099
Heard the what?
Oh, nothing.

02:14.101 --> 02:17.336
Just Little Hootie
I guess.

02:17.338 --> 02:19.638
Hey, pups,
how's it going?

02:19.640 --> 02:20.439
Not so great, Ryder.

02:20.441 --> 02:23.041
Someone's been digging holes
and leaving toys all over.

02:23.043 --> 02:28.780
Hmm. Maybe some wild animal was
prowling around last night.

02:28.782 --> 02:30.782
Or some wild ghost!

02:30.784 --> 02:32.918
Ghost?!
ALL:
No way!

02:32.920 --> 02:33.685
Spooky.

02:33.687 --> 02:35.320
It's definitely a mystery.

02:35.322 --> 02:37.856
Well, I saw something
last night

02:37.858 --> 02:42.027
and it looked
pretty ghosty to me.

02:44.198 --> 02:46.865
(Snoring)

02:46.867 --> 02:49.334
Ah!
(Music playing)

02:49.336 --> 02:51.003
Whoa!

02:51.005 --> 02:54.006
Sounds like
"Pup-Pup Boogie"?

02:54.008 --> 02:55.674
In the middle of the night?

02:55.676 --> 03:01.146
Okay, you-you--
Pup-Pup Boogie-monster.

03:01.148 --> 03:03.081
Come out!

03:03.083 --> 03:04.583
Huh?

03:10.891 --> 03:12.224
Ah! Ghost!

03:12.226 --> 03:15.761
It's okay, Rubble.
It's just me.

03:15.763 --> 03:17.296
Yeah, sorry.

03:17.298 --> 03:20.832
But I did just see
a white thing floating outside,

03:20.834 --> 03:23.368
and heard someone playing
"Pup-Pup Boogie".

03:23.370 --> 03:25.404
Maybe someone forgot
to turn off the game?

03:25.406 --> 03:31.109
That bag of puppy treats wasn't
out here when I went to bed.

03:31.111 --> 03:33.745
It's definitely a ghost.

03:33.747 --> 03:35.047
We'll figure it out, Rubble.

03:35.049 --> 03:38.083
No job is too big,
no pup is too small.

03:38.085 --> 03:40.819
PAW Patrol,
to the Lookout!

03:40.821 --> 03:41.687
(All yawning)

03:41.689 --> 03:43.922
ALL:
Ryder needs us.

03:44.892 --> 03:48.427
Hey, who left
all the toys out?

03:48.429 --> 03:50.896
(Barking)

03:53.234 --> 03:56.001
Whoa!

03:56.003 --> 03:58.237
Rocky, shush.

03:59.273 --> 04:01.106
(Giggling)

04:01.108 --> 04:02.307
Whoa!

04:02.309 --> 04:04.109
(Crashing)

04:04.111 --> 04:05.210
(Laughing)

04:05.212 --> 04:08.080
I said shush.
(Laughing)

04:22.796 --> 04:26.698
PAW Patrol ready for action,
Ryder, sir.

04:27.167 --> 04:28.200
Sorry to wake you pups,

04:28.202 --> 04:31.103
but strange things are
happening at the Lookout.

04:31.105 --> 04:34.139
Someone's digging holes,
dropping toys,

04:34.141 --> 04:39.411
playing games late at night,
and swiping treats.

04:39.413 --> 04:40.379
(All gasping)

04:40.381 --> 04:41.246
Treats?!
No way!

04:41.248 --> 04:43.015
Who would do that?!
Not the cookies!

04:43.017 --> 04:45.083
Rubble thinks
it might be a ghost,

04:45.085 --> 04:49.354
so we need to set up a trap
to figure it out.

04:49.890 --> 04:52.491
I need Super Spy Chase's
night vision goggles

04:52.493 --> 04:54.826
to find out
what's really going on.

04:54.828 --> 04:57.996
Spy Chase
is on the case.

04:58.198 --> 05:02.734
I also need Rocky and his
tool arm to help build the trap.

05:02.736 --> 05:05.003
Green means go!

05:05.005 --> 05:05.537
(Yawning)

05:05.539 --> 05:08.840
The rest of you sleepy pups
can go back to bed.

05:08.842 --> 05:12.344
All right!
PAW Patrol is on a roll!

Okay, Chase,
find a good hiding spot

06:11.939 --> 06:14.172
to keep an eye
on the backyard.

06:14.174 --> 06:16.908
You got it, Ryder.

06:20.514 --> 06:24.983
Super Spy Chase
is on the case.

06:25.519 --> 06:27.986
Hiya, Chase.
Good hiding spot.

06:27.988 --> 06:32.090
Huh? Why do I always
forget the tail?

06:32.092 --> 06:32.691
(Sighing)

06:32.693 --> 06:36.027
Come on, Rocky.
Let's build that trap.

06:37.331 --> 06:40.499
The cookie goes here,
and if anyone tries to take it,

06:40.501 --> 06:42.934
this bell will ring
and the air nozzle

06:42.936 --> 06:46.972
will blow the sheet on
to the intruder, catching it.

06:46.974 --> 06:48.540
Unless it's a ghost.

06:48.542 --> 06:50.642
Ghosts don't usually eat
dog treats.

06:50.644 --> 06:54.312
You're right,
unless it's a dog ghost.

06:54.314 --> 06:56.515
(Laughing)

06:57.418 --> 06:59.551
Hey, Chase,
how's everything?

06:59.553 --> 07:01.620
In position, Ryder.
Standby.

07:01.622 --> 07:04.990
Ruff!
Night vision goggles.

07:06.360 --> 07:08.160
All clear.

07:08.162 --> 07:09.528
Great job, Spy Chase.

07:09.530 --> 07:12.264
I'll check
on the other pups.

07:12.533 --> 07:14.399
Over and out, Ryder, sir.

07:14.401 --> 07:17.002
Ruff!
Suction cups.

07:26.013 --> 07:30.215
An intruder following Ryder.
Chase is on the case!

07:30.217 --> 07:32.951
Ruff! Ruff!
Zip line!

07:37.624 --> 07:39.424
Whoa!

07:42.896 --> 07:44.629
Ah! I caught the ghost!

07:44.631 --> 07:48.300
What?
A ghost?! Ah!

07:48.302 --> 07:49.201
A ghost? Really?

07:49.203 --> 07:52.571
Pups!
No, it's me, Ryder.

07:52.573 --> 07:54.606
Oh, no, the ghost got Ryder.

07:54.608 --> 07:58.343
No, Rubble, the ghost
didn't get me, the trap did.

07:58.345 --> 08:02.380
Sorry, Ryder, I saw
something following you.

08:02.382 --> 08:03.482
That was me.

08:03.484 --> 08:08.153
That's okay.
You were both trying to help.

08:08.155 --> 08:08.720
(Laughing)

08:08.722 --> 08:10.956
Guess we
should keep looking?

08:10.958 --> 08:12.123
Yeah.

08:12.125 --> 08:16.595
Hear that?
It's the Pup-Pup Boogie-monster!

08:16.597 --> 08:18.497
I'd better
check this out.

08:18.499 --> 08:20.532
(Whimpering)

08:20.534 --> 08:23.668
(Music playing)

08:23.670 --> 08:24.269
Hmm.

08:24.271 --> 08:26.238
RUBBLE:
It was a ghost.

08:26.240 --> 08:28.306
It is kind of a mystery.

08:28.308 --> 08:29.274
I need all paws on deck.

08:29.276 --> 08:34.012
Skye, Zuma, Marshall,
meet me in the backyard.

08:36.517 --> 08:37.249
(Yawning)

08:37.251 --> 08:40.118
Sorry to wake you up again,
pups, but I need you all--

08:40.120 --> 08:44.456
Hey, where's Marshall?

08:44.458 --> 08:45.724
Did the ghost get him?

08:45.726 --> 08:46.658
(All gasping)

08:46.660 --> 08:49.194
He's probably
still asleep.

08:49.196 --> 08:51.963
Let's check his pup house.

08:53.267 --> 08:55.066
Ryder, look!

08:55.068 --> 08:56.401
The ghost?

08:56.403 --> 08:58.670
(Gasping)

09:02.509 --> 09:04.976
(Snoring)

09:05.445 --> 09:09.314
That's not a ghost,
it's Marshall!

09:09.316 --> 09:11.516
Hello?
Earth to Marshall!

09:11.518 --> 09:12.584
Where are you going?

09:12.586 --> 09:15.754
RYDER:
Pups, it looks like
Marshall's sleepwalking.

09:15.756 --> 09:18.823
And snow he's
sleep-skateboarding!

09:18.825 --> 09:20.358
That's not good.

09:20.360 --> 09:22.360
Chase, let's go!

09:22.362 --> 09:25.363
He can't skate that well
when he's awake.

09:25.365 --> 09:27.399
(Laughing)

09:28.135 --> 09:30.201
(Snoring)

09:30.203 --> 09:34.172
Marshall, it's Ryder.
Wake up!

09:34.174 --> 09:35.807
Chase! Your zip line!

09:35.809 --> 09:39.344
Great idea!
Ruff! Zip line!

09:43.417 --> 09:44.382
Got him!

09:44.384 --> 09:46.651
(Snoring)

09:49.222 --> 09:50.689
Lost him.

09:52.426 --> 09:55.226
Zuma, I need you
down at the docks!

09:55.228 --> 09:58.296
No worries,
I'm right here.

09:58.298 --> 10:00.565
(Snoring)

10:03.103 --> 10:06.538
Whoa! Awesome move!

10:06.540 --> 10:09.040
(Snoring)

10:14.615 --> 10:17.048
Uh-oh!

10:21.488 --> 10:22.520
(Cawing)

10:22.522 --> 10:23.455
Huh?

10:23.457 --> 10:24.856
(Yawning)

10:24.858 --> 10:28.426
I was having this silly dream
that I was...

10:28.428 --> 10:29.260
(Gasping)

10:29.262 --> 10:31.796
Surfing on a whale!

10:31.798 --> 10:34.199
Whoa!

10:34.201 --> 10:36.801
Help!

10:36.803 --> 10:38.403
Uh-oh.

10:38.405 --> 10:39.738
Hang tight, dude.

10:39.740 --> 10:42.340
(Barking)
Buoy!

10:45.412 --> 10:50.215
Don't worry, Marshall.
You're safe, sound and awake.

10:50.217 --> 10:53.351
Uh, all right.
Thanks, Zuma!

10:55.822 --> 10:57.355
Whoa!

10:57.357 --> 10:58.723
Oof! I'm good!

10:58.725 --> 11:01.292
Ryder? Chase?
What's up?

11:01.294 --> 11:05.063
We figured out who
the Pup-Pup Boogie monster is.

11:05.065 --> 11:05.597
Who?

11:05.599 --> 11:08.166
You! You've been
sleepwalking.

11:08.168 --> 11:11.770
Sleepwalking? No wonder my legs
are so tired in the morning!

11:11.772 --> 11:16.207
Don't worry, Marshall, even when
a PAW Patrol pup is in trouble,

11:16.209 --> 11:17.842
they just
have to yelp--

11:17.844 --> 11:19.177
BOTH:
Or snore.

11:19.179 --> 11:20.378
(Laughing)

11:20.380 --> 11:21.746
For help.

11:22.416 --> 11:26.251
Okay, all you good pups,
time to go to bed,

11:26.253 --> 11:27.552
and stay there!

11:27.554 --> 11:29.554
(Air whooshing)

11:29.556 --> 11:33.058
Did Rubble
find more ghosts?

11:33.894 --> 11:34.826
There is a ghost.

11:34.828 --> 11:38.329
Or a Rubble
caught in the ghost trap.

11:40.233 --> 11:43.168
I found the
double liver chip cookies!

11:43.170 --> 11:43.902
Yummy!

11:43.904 --> 11:46.404
(Laughing)

11:52.546 --> 11:58.383
Fear not, fair princess, pups of
the round table will save thee.

11:58.385 --> 11:59.718
Uh-oh.

11:59.720 --> 12:01.953
Whoa!

12:04.758 --> 12:05.590
(Laughing)

12:05.592 --> 12:09.527
But who will rescue Marshall
from under the throne?

12:09.529 --> 12:10.929
Marshall!
(Laughing)

12:10.931 --> 12:13.932
This is a job
for King Arthur!

12:13.934 --> 12:15.433
You are free, good--

12:15.435 --> 12:16.768
(Coughing)

12:16.770 --> 12:17.569
Um, knight.

12:17.571 --> 12:19.504
King Arthur and the Pups
of the Round Table

12:19.506 --> 12:23.041
will be the best play
Adventure Bay has ever seen!

12:23.043 --> 12:23.975
(Cheering)

12:23.977 --> 12:25.977
It'll be knight-tastic!

12:25.979 --> 12:28.480
(Laughing)

12:29.649 --> 12:32.751
Yoo-hoo!
Captain Turbot!

12:32.753 --> 12:33.685
How is
my set coming?

12:33.687 --> 12:37.355
Castle construction is close
to complete completion.

12:37.357 --> 12:39.691
Just one last nail.

12:40.093 --> 12:42.527
Oh!
(Gasping)

12:42.529 --> 12:43.828
Oh, dear!
Are you okay?

12:43.830 --> 12:47.966
It's a madcap Medieval mess
in here, and I'm stuck.

12:47.968 --> 12:51.569
Oh, no!
We need the PAW Patrol.

12:51.571 --> 12:52.470
(Ringing)

12:52.472 --> 12:53.905
Hi, Mayor Goodway.

12:53.907 --> 12:55.306
<i> Ryder,</i>
<i> crisis at the castle.</i>

12:55.308 --> 12:58.743
<i> The set collapsed</i>
<i> around Captain Turbot.</i>

12:58.745 --> 12:59.944
<i> Uh, hi, Ryder.</i>

12:59.946 --> 13:01.012
Don't worry, Mayor Goodway.

13:01.014 --> 13:04.616
No job is too big,
no pup is too small.

13:04.618 --> 13:06.317
<i> Bye, Ryder.</i>

13:06.319 --> 13:08.319
PAW Patrol,
to the Lookout!

13:08.321 --> 13:10.588
ALL:
Ryder needs us!

13:11.925 --> 13:13.658
(Barking)

13:13.660 --> 13:15.059
I'm coming!

13:15.061 --> 13:17.562
Oh, no, not again.

13:17.564 --> 13:19.664
Whoa!

13:19.666 --> 13:21.733
Whoa!

13:22.969 --> 13:25.570
Well, at least
I can see now.

13:25.572 --> 13:28.973
(Laughing)

13:43.423 --> 13:44.689
PAW Patrol ready for--

13:44.691 --> 13:46.090
(Coughing)

13:46.092 --> 13:48.193
For duty, Ryder, sir.

13:48.195 --> 13:49.861
Thanks for
coming so fast, pups.

13:49.863 --> 13:54.999
The castles that Captain Turbot
was building fell down,

13:55.001 --> 13:56.601
and he's trapped underneath.

13:56.603 --> 13:58.803
<i> Help, help, help!</i>

13:59.072 --> 14:02.040
Chase, I need you
and your winch, rope and hook

14:02.042 --> 14:03.074
to move
the wall pieces.

14:03.076 --> 14:07.679
Your good knight Chase
be-ist on the case, my liege.

14:07.681 --> 14:10.114
(Laughing)

14:10.116 --> 14:11.182
That means, Chase is--

14:11.184 --> 14:12.450
(Clearing throat)

14:12.452 --> 14:14.419
Is on the case.

14:14.421 --> 14:15.920
Are you feeling okay?

14:15.922 --> 14:17.488
Sure! Never better!

14:17.490 --> 14:19.657
(Coughing)

14:19.926 --> 14:22.760
Rubble, I need you to use
your crane and claw

14:22.762 --> 14:24.863
to lift
the broken set pieces.

14:24.865 --> 14:27.665
Rubble on the double!

14:27.868 --> 14:30.201
Marshall, I need you
and your x-ray screen

14:30.203 --> 14:33.071
to check Captain Turbot
and make sure he isn't hurt.

14:33.073 --> 14:36.641
I'm ready for
a ruff-ruff rescue!

14:36.643 --> 14:40.211
All right!
PAW Patrol is on a roll!

Hi!
Hey, dude.

15:45.912 --> 15:47.645
Hi, Cap'n Turbot.
Are you okay?

15:47.647 --> 15:49.113
PAW Patrol
is here to help.

15:49.115 --> 15:50.882
Cap'n Turbot, how--

15:50.884 --> 15:51.950
(Coughing)

15:51.952 --> 15:52.984
Art thee?

15:52.986 --> 15:53.985
Super!

15:53.987 --> 15:55.019
But stuck.

15:55.021 --> 15:57.088
Oh, and my arm
smarts a smidge.

15:57.090 --> 15:59.557
We'll have you out
in no time, captain.

15:59.559 --> 16:02.827
Rubble, use your claw hook
to lift the wall.

16:02.829 --> 16:05.196
On the double.

16:14.140 --> 16:14.906
(Cheering)

16:14.908 --> 16:17.942
Rubble! Thanks for
getting me out of there.

16:17.944 --> 16:19.811
Well, almost.

16:19.813 --> 16:23.648
It seems I'm still stuck
under this silly scenery.

16:23.650 --> 16:24.282
Hmm.

16:24.284 --> 16:25.683
Chase, your winch!

16:25.685 --> 16:28.519
On it, sire, sire.

16:29.923 --> 16:32.523
(Siren wailing)

16:33.560 --> 16:34.659
(Barking)

16:34.661 --> 16:36.894
Winch!

16:39.666 --> 16:41.299
Go ahead, Chase.

16:41.301 --> 16:43.968
(Barking)

16:43.970 --> 16:44.902

16:44.904 --> 16:47.205
Oh, thanks for
freeing me from--

16:47.207 --> 16:47.905
Whoa!

16:47.907 --> 16:50.742
Okay, Captain,
I need to do a medical exam.

16:50.744 --> 16:52.010
Huh?
(Barking)

16:52.012 --> 16:53.745
X-ray screen.

17:00.887 --> 17:04.856
Hmm, looks like
it's only a sprain.

17:04.858 --> 17:06.024
I'll wrap it up.

17:06.026 --> 17:07.658
(Barking)

17:07.660 --> 17:10.261
Try not to use your wrist
for a couple of days.

17:10.263 --> 17:11.229
Oh, I can't rest.

17:11.231 --> 17:12.797
I have to rapidly
rebuild the rampart

17:12.799 --> 17:14.198
and quickly construct
the castle.

17:14.200 --> 17:17.735
Don't worry, Captain,
the PAW Patrol will help.

17:17.737 --> 17:19.237
Yeah, the show must--

17:19.239 --> 17:21.305
(Coughing)

17:21.307 --> 17:24.008
Must-eth go on
so I can go on.

17:24.010 --> 17:26.210
That's why
you're the star, Chase,

17:26.212 --> 17:28.079
you're such
a take-charge pup.

17:28.081 --> 17:30.114
Too true.
Yep, that's our Chase.

17:30.116 --> 17:33.284
Okay, let's put this castle
back together.

17:33.286 --> 17:35.386
(Barking)
Megaphone!

17:35.388 --> 17:37.055
Okay, my knights of the--

17:37.057 --> 17:37.822
(Coughing)

17:37.824 --> 17:40.825

Hey!

17:55.675 --> 17:56.874
Guys?

17:56.876 --> 18:03.748
¶

18:03.750 --> 18:06.417
Oh, thank you,
brave knights,

18:06.419 --> 18:08.786
for restoring the castle.

18:08.788 --> 18:11.022
Now the play
can start on time.

18:11.024 --> 18:13.391
(Howling)

18:13.393 --> 18:14.292
(Coughing)

18:14.294 --> 18:16.327
Are you okay, Chase?

18:16.329 --> 18:18.262
You sound
a little hoarse.

18:18.264 --> 18:20.631
No, I'm just
a little pup.

18:20.633 --> 18:22.166
(Laughing)

18:22.168 --> 18:24.802
Are you getting
a puppy cold?

18:24.804 --> 18:26.804
Marshall,
can you take a look?

18:26.806 --> 18:30.741
Wow!
Two patients in one day!

18:31.911 --> 18:35.980
Uh-oh!
You've got a fever.

18:35.982 --> 18:37.014
Cough for me.

18:37.016 --> 18:37.748
(Coughing)

18:37.750 --> 18:41.686
Chase, you have a cold and
you're losing your voice.

18:41.688 --> 18:43.421
No play for you, pal.

18:43.423 --> 18:44.122
But-but--

18:44.124 --> 18:46.290
You need lots of rest
and liquids.

18:46.292 --> 18:47.792
But, but, but, but--

18:47.794 --> 18:49.160
Oh, my stars!

18:49.162 --> 18:50.995
I mean, my star--

18:50.997 --> 18:51.863
Of the show!

18:51.865 --> 18:54.799
How can we put on a play
starring King Arthur

18:54.801 --> 18:55.399
with no Arthur?

18:55.401 --> 18:58.669
Maybe one of the pups
could fill in for Chase.

18:58.671 --> 19:01.038
But, but, but--
Wonderful idea!

19:01.040 --> 19:02.707
Uh, Marshall!

19:02.709 --> 19:03.774
Wha-a-a...

19:03.776 --> 19:06.177
You can save the show
for everyone.

19:06.179 --> 19:07.311
But, but, but--

19:07.313 --> 19:08.379
You know all the words,

19:08.381 --> 19:11.782
and you're the only other pup
that the crown fits.

19:11.784 --> 19:14.752
But, but, but I only
know how to be a knight!

19:14.754 --> 19:15.353
(Clucking)

19:15.355 --> 19:17.788
Chase said you helped him
learn all his lines.

19:17.790 --> 19:20.858
Come on,
Marshall, you can do it!

19:20.860 --> 19:22.193
Yeah, for me!

19:22.195 --> 19:23.060
(Coughing)

19:23.062 --> 19:24.962
Chase, you'd better
get home to rest.

19:24.964 --> 19:27.932
Katie can
take care of you.

19:27.934 --> 19:29.167
But, but--

19:29.169 --> 19:30.201
(Sighing)

19:30.203 --> 19:31.402
(Coughing)

19:31.404 --> 19:32.470
Can't even watch the play.

19:32.472 --> 19:36.774
Don't worry, Chase,
Ryder has a plan.

19:36.776 --> 19:39.844
(Applauding)

19:39.846 --> 19:41.946
Welcome to the show!

19:41.948 --> 19:44.148
(Beeping)
Hey, Chase!

19:44.150 --> 19:44.982
Ryder?

19:44.984 --> 19:46.817
<i> We thought you'd like</i>
<i> to watch the play.</i>

19:46.819 --> 19:47.552
<i> Check it out.</i>

19:47.554 --> 19:49.954
<i> Without further ado,</i>
<i> I present</i>

19:49.956 --> 19:55.393
King Arthur and the Pups
of the Round Table.

a brave group of knights.

20:02.802 --> 20:05.002

20:18.418 --> 20:21.352
Oh, yeah,
that's the spot.

I'm Lady Fly-a-lot.

20:24.324 --> 20:25.256
(Cheering)

20:25.258 --> 20:26.224
The Knights' mighty leader

20:26.226 --> 20:29.160
was the bravest
knight in the land.

20:30.330 --> 20:34.098
The bravest
knight in the land!

20:34.100 --> 20:35.900
(Applauding)

20:35.902 --> 20:37.168
Huh?

20:37.170 --> 20:38.502

Ah!

20:40.039 --> 20:41.038
(Gasping)

20:41.040 --> 20:42.540
Marshall, what's wrong?

20:42.542 --> 20:46.043
I can't do it.
I can't remember a single word

20:46.045 --> 20:48.312
with everyone
staring at me like that.

20:48.314 --> 20:51.315
Don't worry,
I'll help you get started.

20:51.317 --> 20:54.485
Okay. Whoa!

20:54.487 --> 20:56.487

Oh, no.

21:04.230 --> 21:08.966
Behold, the princess's throne,

21:08.968 --> 21:11.869
Behold, the princess's
phone needs ice tea.

21:12.905 --> 21:14.038
I mean, is empty!

21:14.040 --> 21:16.207

21:16.209 --> 21:19.910
Is empty!

21:19.912 --> 21:20.511

the fair princess?

21:24.117 --> 21:25.750

21:27.954 --> 21:29.954
You can do it!

21:30.556 --> 21:31.922
Fear not, fair princess,

21:31.924 --> 21:36.861
Arthur and his brave pups of the
round table will saveth thee!

Behold, the bone!

21:46.806 --> 21:48.572
Mm! Looks delicious.

21:48.574 --> 21:53.444
Whoever pulls it
from the stone becomes king.

22:22.642 --> 22:24.375
Great job,
all of you!

22:24.377 --> 22:27.511
You're such good pups.

22:28.381 --> 22:30.281
Heads up!

22:30.616 --> 22:33.150
All hail King Arthur!

22:33.152 --> 22:37.221
Hail King Arthur!

22:37.223 --> 22:39.223
Yay!
Cali's okay!

22:39.225 --> 22:40.391
Marshall did it!

22:40.393 --> 22:41.659

22:41.661 --> 22:42.526
(Coughing)

22:42.528 --> 22:45.229
Back to bed,
brave Sir Chase.

22:45.231 --> 22:47.898
But, but--
Oh...
