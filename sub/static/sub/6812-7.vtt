WEBVTT

00:18.980 --> 00:20.971
That was awesome.
Can we do It again?

00:21.050 --> 00:23.883
Uh, I need a break, Mason.
Aren't you dizzy?

00:23.950 --> 00:26.657
I'm not tall enough
to go on without you.
Oh...

00:26.720 --> 00:28.711
Hey, how about that one?

00:28.790 --> 00:30.883
Come on,
that's for babies, Ilsa.

00:30.960 --> 00:32.359
MAN: It's a bomb! Run!

00:36.130 --> 00:37.358
What's going on?

00:37.430 --> 00:38.863
GIRL: Mommy! Daddy!

00:38.930 --> 00:40.795
Mason, run! Run!

00:52.880 --> 00:54.518
All right, you guys ready?

00:54.580 --> 00:57.617
KIDS: Ready!

00:57.690 --> 01:01.114
All right, wow.
Pretty tricky
with all the masks.

01:01.190 --> 01:03.750
And we changed
other stuff, too.
We got you, Carrie.

01:03.830 --> 01:07.027
Yeah, this is
gonna be pretty tough.
I think I might be stumped.

01:07.100 --> 01:08.920
Okay.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.865
Well, you switched
your shoes with tiger girl
over here,

01:10.930 --> 01:12.636
which is pretty tricky,

01:12.700 --> 01:15.260
but you still
have cotton candy
on your dress.

01:15.340 --> 01:17.001
Right, Ali?
Ah, you got me!

01:17.070 --> 01:18.264
Woo-hoo!

01:18.340 --> 01:19.978
Gorilla, now you're
a smart one

01:20.040 --> 01:21.769
because you changed your
T-shirt inside out

01:21.840 --> 01:23.376
to hide the logo.

01:23.450 --> 01:27.614
But I would recognize
this awesome haircut
anywhere, Daniel.

01:28.380 --> 01:29.938
Pirate is Nick.

01:30.650 --> 01:32.754
The giraffe is Maddie.

01:33.360 --> 01:34.554
Woo-hoo!

01:34.620 --> 01:36.121
How did you know all that?

01:36.190 --> 01:38.658
Because I'm a_sorceress.
I'm a Witch.

01:40.430 --> 01:41.795
Oh, no!

01:41.860 --> 01:43.919
Oh, no!

01:44.000 --> 01:46.468
Do you need some help?
Who wants some pizza?

01:46.540 --> 01:47.939
Pizza, pizza, pizza!
GIRL: Me!

01:48.000 --> 01:50.139
Come on,
get in line for pizza.
CARRIE: Whoo!

01:50.210 --> 01:51.632
Who doesn't love pizza?

01:51.710 --> 01:53.268
Thank you, Sandra.

01:53.340 --> 01:55.001
Yeah, thank you.
You know, I had a feeling

01:55.080 --> 01:56.900
your special powers
might come in handy.
Ah!

01:56.980 --> 01:59.676
Not to mention you're
a hell of a lot cheaper
than both the magician

01:59.750 --> 02:02.139
and the guy with
the snakes, so...

02:02.220 --> 02:05.644
My brilliant niece
only turns 11 once, right?

02:08.020 --> 02:09.089
Hey, Al.

02:15.130 --> 02:16.324
Hey.

02:16.400 --> 02:19.198
Hey.
Kid's name is Mason Allen.

02:19.270 --> 02:20.828
Parents have been notified.

02:20.900 --> 02:23.698
Uniforms are
scouring the park,
but so far, nothing.

02:23.770 --> 02:26.136
One of the ride jockeys
saw something wedged
under the carousel,

02:26.210 --> 02:27.700
thought it was a bomb,

02:27.780 --> 02:31.147
turned out to be
the operator's backpack,
but caused a stampede.

02:31.210 --> 02:33.610
And when it was over,
Mason was gone.

02:33.680 --> 02:34.908
Who was he with?

02:34.980 --> 02:36.880
His nanny, Ilsa Ginya.

02:41.720 --> 02:44.450
Ilsa, hi, I'm Carrie Wells.
I'm a detective.

02:44.530 --> 02:46.498
I'm gonna help you
find Mason, okay?

02:46.560 --> 02:49.768
What can you tell me
about what happened
right before you lost him?

02:49.830 --> 02:52.094
I already told the officer.

02:52.170 --> 02:53.990
I got knocked down
when people started running.

02:54.070 --> 02:57.164
They said I got knocked out.
Now I can't ﬁnd Mason.

02:57.240 --> 02:59.037
He's only seven years old.

02:59.110 --> 03:01.169
It's okay.
Please, you have to
help me find him.

03:01.240 --> 03:02.707
Help me find him.
Stay back.

03:06.820 --> 03:08.913
It's okay. All right?
We're going to find him.

03:08.980 --> 03:10.413
Thank you.

03:25.670 --> 03:27.695
Yeah, all right.
I appreciate it. Thank you.

03:27.770 --> 03:29.533
All right, so look.
PD, FD, EMS,

03:29.610 --> 03:31.259
whole alphabet
soup out looking.
So far, nothing.

03:31.340 --> 03:32.932
No sign of Mason.

03:33.010 --> 03:35.069
I'm thinking if he was taken,
maybe it's a crime
of opportunity.

03:35.140 --> 03:36.869
Someone who sees
the chaos of the
bomb scare,

03:36.950 --> 03:38.577
notices the kid
runnIng around,
takes him?

03:38.650 --> 03:41.471
Except, turns out,
he's not just any kid.
He's Kenneth Allen's kid.

03:41.550 --> 03:42.983
Am I supposed to know
who that is, or what?

03:43.050 --> 03:44.312
You're supposed to
know that Kenneth

03:44.390 --> 03:45.812
and his wife
Gwen's company, Protech,

03:45.890 --> 03:48.484
_ made a small fortune
In tactical protective wear.

03:48.560 --> 03:50.425
They improved
the old formula for Kevlar.

03:50.490 --> 03:51.821
You know what, I did.
I did hear that.

03:51.890 --> 03:53.699
Apparently the NFL's
supposed to be using

03:53.760 --> 03:55.296
that in their
helmets this year, right?
Something like that?

03:55.360 --> 03:57.726
Hey, just left the park.
No sign of Mason.

03:57.800 --> 03:59.939
Okay, check with the doorman,
see if anyone

04:00.000 --> 04:01.695
suspicious has
been hanging around.

04:01.770 --> 04:02.907
All right.

04:07.110 --> 04:10.546
_ Ma_son loves
Victorian Gardens.

04:10.610 --> 04:13.010
We were just
there last weekend,
the three of us.

04:13.920 --> 04:16.286
Mr. Allen, I have to ask you,

04:16.350 --> 04:18.887
can you think of anyone
who would want to hurt you?

04:18.950 --> 04:20.451
I don't think so, no.

04:20.520 --> 04:22.158
What about your employees?

04:22.220 --> 04:24.780
Business, domestic,
any personnel issues lately?

04:24.860 --> 04:27.522
We have over 250
people working for us.

04:27.600 --> 04:28.897
I mean,
there's always issues, but...

04:28.960 --> 04:30.928
Why are we talking about this?

04:31.000 --> 04:32.365
We need to be
looking for Mason.

04:32.440 --> 04:35.034
Mr. Allen, we have to explore
every possibility.

04:37.570 --> 04:42.439
Is it possible someone else,
a business rival maybe,

04:42.510 --> 04:43.772
would have
a grudge against you?

04:44.650 --> 04:46.777
Well, I'm successful.

04:47.980 --> 04:50.983
Success pisses
people off sometimes.

04:51.050 --> 04:53.416
But I play fair.
We have a good company.

04:54.420 --> 04:56.183
No.

04:56.260 --> 05:00.196
There's no one I can
think of who would do
something like this.

05:00.260 --> 05:02.421
Okay.

05:02.500 --> 05:04.695
And, no.
To save you the trouble,
there's no one else.

05:04.770 --> 05:06.362
Gwen and_I are
very much in love.

05:08.200 --> 05:09.861
Believe me,

05:09.940 --> 05:12.261
I wouldn't _
endanger my son's life
for one second

05:12.340 --> 05:13.830
by keeping anything from you.

05:14.480 --> 05:15.799
I appreciate that.

05:29.120 --> 05:30.451
CARRIE: He likes to read, huh?

05:30.530 --> 05:32.054
Yeah. He gets that from me.

05:32.130 --> 05:35.657
We love to just sit down
and snuggle up
with a good book.

05:38.170 --> 05:39.933
Hansel and Gretel?

05:40.000 --> 05:42.537
That's Grimm's Fairy Tales,
his favorite.

05:50.180 --> 05:52.239
Was he on his
computer a lot?

05:52.310 --> 05:55.279
Not a lot, no.
He doesn't go online.

05:57.020 --> 05:59.079
You don't think that that...

05:59.150 --> 06:01.152
Listen, we don't
know anything right now.

06:01.220 --> 06:02.949
I just have to ask
the questions, okay?

06:03.030 --> 06:04.986
Oh, my God.

06:05.060 --> 06:06.823
How can this be happening?

06:08.630 --> 06:09.665
Okay.

06:09.730 --> 06:11.061
AL: Okay, stay calm.

06:11.130 --> 06:13.166
Keep him on the line
as long as possible.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.069
Who is this?

06:17.140 --> 06:18.402
MAN: I have your son.

06:19.540 --> 06:21.906
Please.
Please don't hurt him.

06:21.980 --> 06:23.902
MAN: I'll call back with
further instructions.

06:23.980 --> 06:26.346
No cops, no FBI.

06:26.420 --> 06:29.139
I want to speak to my son.
I want to know that he's okay.

06:29.220 --> 06:33.213
MAN: Follow my instructions,
and I'll return him
to you safe and sound.

06:33.290 --> 06:34.882
Blue watch and all.

06:37.160 --> 06:38.354
Blue watch?

06:38.430 --> 06:39.920
He was wearing
that this morning.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.456
We gave it to him
for his birthday.

06:49.810 --> 06:51.766
Hey, boss, you get
anything on the nanny?

06:51.840 --> 06:54.638
Been with the family
since Mason was born.
No record.

06:54.710 --> 06:57.099
She's overcome by all this.
Had to be hospitalized.

06:57.180 --> 06:59.341
We're checking.
I don't like her for it.

06:59.410 --> 07:01.412
All right.

07:01.480 --> 07:05.018
Hey. All right,
we're set on the ransom.

07:05.090 --> 07:07.650
You know they're asking
for million bucks?

07:07.720 --> 07:10.188
Not many people could
swing that kinda
dough in under an hour.

07:10.260 --> 07:12.899
Not too many people
own a private island
in the Seychelles either.

07:12.960 --> 07:14.188
That's true.

07:17.400 --> 07:20.039
Follow the plan
and you'll get your son back.

07:20.100 --> 07:22.193
The caller was very specific.
No cops.

07:22.270 --> 07:26.263
Mr. Allen, believe me,
we do this all the time.
You gotta trust us.

07:26.340 --> 07:28.103
I'm sorry, it's just...

07:28.180 --> 07:30.239
This is my son's life
we're talking about.

07:30.310 --> 07:31.743
I understand.

07:31.810 --> 07:35.018
Look, it's simple.
You're making a transaction.

07:35.080 --> 07:37.719
You give him what he wants,
he gives us what we want.

07:37.790 --> 07:40.281
My son is not some
business transaction,
Lieutenant.

07:40.360 --> 07:43.818
I know it's impossible,
but you gotta try to
take away the emotion,

07:43.890 --> 07:47.553
because that's what
it is to him. Okay?

07:47.630 --> 07:50.895
We'll be watching you,
making sure you
and Mason are safe.

07:53.100 --> 07:54.590
Walk me through it again.

07:54.670 --> 07:56.968
You_ take these
bags into your car.

07:57.040 --> 07:59.429
He'll be calling
you with instructions
for the drop-off.

07:59.510 --> 08:03.742
We'll be listening.
We will follow you
wherever he tells you to go.

08:03.810 --> 08:07.246
Whatever he asks for,
you give him. Okay?

08:08.350 --> 08:09.942
You ready?
Yes.

08:40.850 --> 08:42.317
Where are you?
MAN: Anybody follow you?

08:42.380 --> 08:44.382
No.
Come to
the platform above the pool.

08:44.450 --> 08:45.883
You have five minutes.

08:45.950 --> 08:47.554
KEN: Where?

08:49.690 --> 08:51.658
Oh, Shit! Shit!

08:51.730 --> 08:53.595
Hello

08:57.730 --> 09:00.836
Hey,
dad is moving south in park.
I have eyes.

09:02.040 --> 09:03.405
Headed towards the pool.

09:18.190 --> 09:21.580
Nice work. You made it.
I want you to listen
to me very carefully.

09:21.660 --> 09:23.878
Leave the bags
under the bench
and step away.

09:23.960 --> 09:26.656
Don't make a scene.
Just calmly walk away.

09:26.730 --> 09:29.995
You've come this far.
I don't want your
son to get hurt.

09:33.300 --> 09:36.804
_Allen
Are you listening to me?

09:36.870 --> 09:39.839
Give me my boy,
you son of a bitch.

09:41.940 --> 09:43.168
Where is my son?

09:46.650 --> 09:48.117
Hey!

09:48.180 --> 09:49.909
Hey, hey, hey. You stay here.

09:51.950 --> 09:53.110
DENNY: Hey!

09:53.190 --> 09:54.452
Hey!

09:54.520 --> 09:56.784
Eastbound. Blue jeans.
Gray and blue shirt.

10:00.030 --> 10:01.497
Damn it!

10:01.560 --> 10:04.529
Hey! Lost the suspect.
Last seen near park exit.

10:04.600 --> 10:07.239
He could be heading your way.
Keep an eye out.

10:11.440 --> 10:13.078
Check with the doorman,
see if anyone

10:13.140 --> 10:14.732
suspicious has
been hanging around.

10:14.810 --> 10:16.107
All right.

10:19.480 --> 10:20.879
That car.

10:20.950 --> 10:23.089
Al, I saw it outside
the Allen place.

10:27.360 --> 10:28.918
Show me your hands, now!

10:28.990 --> 10:31.424
Put the car in park.
Put it in park!

10:32.430 --> 10:33.749
Get out.

10:33.830 --> 10:35.252
Where is he?
SEAN: I don't have him!

10:35.330 --> 10:36.627
Where is he?

10:36.700 --> 10:38.327
I don't have him,
I never had him!

10:42.840 --> 10:44.262
I just finished
taking a lunch
break in the park

10:44.340 --> 10:46.501
when I heard all
this screaming.

10:46.570 --> 10:49.232
Something about a bomb.

10:49.310 --> 10:51.175
It was crazy.
You know,
there was cop cars,

10:51.250 --> 10:53.241
TV cameras, people all over.

10:54.620 --> 10:56.349
Then somebody
walks away with a kid.

10:56.420 --> 10:57.910
And you didn't
try to stop him?

10:57.990 --> 10:59.548
I thought he
was taking the kid
to his parents.

10:59.620 --> 11:01.508
How was I supposed to know
it was a kidnapping?

11:01.590 --> 11:02.955
How did you
find out it was?

11:03.030 --> 11:04.759
The kid's picture
was all over the news.

11:04.830 --> 11:06.923
I saw him on TV
and I put two
and two together.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.297
Congrats on your brilliance.

11:08.360 --> 11:09.793
Look,
I didn't do anything wrong!

11:09.870 --> 11:12.521
Lying to the police?
Extortion?

11:12.600 --> 11:15.433
You do realize _
you tried to cash in
on this kid's disappearance.

11:15.500 --> 11:17.707
You're looking at
serious time here, Sean.

11:19.440 --> 11:21.078
You gotta help me out, man.

11:21.140 --> 11:23.108
Help yourself out.

11:23.180 --> 11:25.171
Tell me what you saw.

11:25.250 --> 11:28.970
The kid was
taken away by a man.
What did the guy look like?

11:29.050 --> 11:30.586
Like some guy, you know?

11:30.650 --> 11:32.914
No, I don't know!
Tell me more! Details!

11:32.990 --> 11:35.959
White guy.
Baseball cap.
Yankees, maybe.

11:36.020 --> 11:37.282
Beard.

11:39.160 --> 11:40.491
What else?

11:44.170 --> 11:47.059
I did notice something.
The kid, he...

11:47.140 --> 11:48.698
He was kind
of breathing heaw.

11:48.770 --> 11:50.931
Like, breathing into
his hands. Like this.

11:52.370 --> 11:54.736
His seizures.

11:54.810 --> 11:56.402
Mason has seizure disorder?

11:56.480 --> 11:58.869
We got it under control
with medication.

11:58.950 --> 12:01.748
He hasn't had one in years.
My God.

12:01.820 --> 12:03.378
If he's having
them again...

12:10.130 --> 12:12.280
SANDRA: Hey,
you have a minute?
Sure.

12:12.360 --> 12:14.658
All right. So, it looks like
that idiot that you guys
grabbed up in the park

12:14.730 --> 12:17.221
was just looking
for a payday.
Okay.

12:17.300 --> 12:19.996
Now, this officially
could be a missing
persons case.

12:20.070 --> 12:22.368
Right.
And we both know
the stats on that one.

12:22.440 --> 12:23.805
I'm gonna find him.

12:23.870 --> 12:25.337
All right,
well, you just need
to prepare yourself.

12:25.410 --> 12:26.968
I said I'm gonna find him.

12:27.040 --> 12:28.871
Hey, guys? Another ransom
call just came in.

12:28.940 --> 12:30.441
It's to the
Allens' home number.

12:33.380 --> 12:34.938
Okay, stay calm.

12:35.020 --> 12:37.545
And remember,
we need proof of life.

12:42.790 --> 12:44.087
Hello?

12:44.160 --> 12:45.457
MAN: If you want to
see your son alive,

12:45.530 --> 12:48.055
you will listen to
me very carefully.

12:48.130 --> 12:49.893
Okay,
just tell me what you want.

12:49.970 --> 12:52.723
Two million. In cash.

12:52.800 --> 12:54.461
I want to speak to my son.

12:54.540 --> 12:55.996
I want to know
that he's alive.

12:56.070 --> 12:57.162
Your son is fine.

12:57.240 --> 12:58.400
Put him on the phone.

13:00.440 --> 13:01.737
MASON: Daddy?

13:01.810 --> 13:04.347
Mason. It's Daddy.
Are you okay?

13:04.410 --> 13:07.618
MASON: I was a little sick
but I'm better now.

13:07.680 --> 13:09.944
Daddy, I want to come home.
When are you...

13:10.020 --> 13:13.285
MAN: Listen to me.
You're gonna
receive a text message.

13:13.360 --> 13:14.918
Then you're
gonna wire the money

13:14.990 --> 13:16.855
into the account
listed in the text.

13:16.930 --> 13:19.956
When I receive the money,
I'll give you your son.

13:20.030 --> 13:21.429
Say goodbye, Mason.

13:21.500 --> 13:23.388
MASON: Goodbye, Daddy.
Mason?

13:28.540 --> 13:30.235
JAY: Signal was jammed.

13:30.310 --> 13:31.937
This guy knows
what he's doing.

13:32.010 --> 13:35.673
Mason just said,
"I was a little sick."

13:35.740 --> 13:37.970
Does your son know
the name of his medication?

13:38.050 --> 13:39.972
Clonazepam.
Yeah, he knows it.
Mmm-hmm.

13:40.050 --> 13:42.143
Okay, but he doesn't
have a prescription.

13:42.220 --> 13:45.348
Jay, drugstore robberies
in the last 24 hours.

13:45.420 --> 13:46.887
On it.

13:49.860 --> 13:51.589
Looks like there were
two stores that got hit.

13:51.660 --> 13:53.298
One in Queens,
one up by Columbia.

13:53.360 --> 13:54.395
Wait a minute.

14:00.040 --> 14:02.759
That guy.
That's him, right there.

14:02.840 --> 14:04.364
There was a picture
on Mason's computer.

14:04.440 --> 14:05.702
That guy was in
the background.

14:05.770 --> 14:06.907
Do you know him?

14:06.980 --> 14:08.709
I've never seen him before.

14:08.780 --> 14:10.771
The picture was of
Mason at a waterpark
wearing green shorts.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.647
He was running
through the water.
When was that?

14:12.710 --> 14:14.314
Uh, about three weeks ago.

14:15.780 --> 14:17.145
Okay. Al?

14:18.490 --> 14:19.514
Give us a second.

14:28.500 --> 14:31.492
That piece of shit
was stalking Mason.

14:31.570 --> 14:33.037
He's been planning
this for weeks.

14:33.100 --> 14:34.988
Waiting for the right
opportunity to grab him.

14:35.070 --> 14:38.403
Hey, guys.
Security cameras outside
the Duane Reade on 106th

14:38.470 --> 14:41.303
picked up a car driving away
from the scene at
the time of the robbery.

14:41.380 --> 14:43.302
Matches a brown
2002 Buick LeSabre

14:43.380 --> 14:45.245
stolen yesterday
from 92nd and Riverside.

14:45.310 --> 14:47.471
New York plates.
Right front hubcap
is missing.

14:47.550 --> 14:49.438
You put a BOLO out?
Every eye in the city, boss.

14:53.120 --> 14:55.816
Tracked the stolen Buick
to this neighborhood.

14:55.890 --> 14:57.949
Neighbor confirmed,
suspect matching
the screen-grab

14:58.030 --> 14:59.622
was spotted
entering the building.

14:59.690 --> 15:01.328
All right,
let's hope Mason's with him.

15:01.400 --> 15:02.799
We're standing by.
Okay.

15:02.860 --> 15:04.020
Let's go.

15:22.320 --> 15:23.548
He's not here.

15:25.490 --> 15:26.548
Al?

15:28.790 --> 15:30.553
Someone took him.

15:37.570 --> 15:39.697
Dead man is Jason Lutz.
No record.

15:39.770 --> 15:42.295
Mostly blue-collar
jobs around the city.

15:42.370 --> 15:44.406
Well, I don't know
what I'm going to
tell the parents.

15:44.470 --> 15:46.529
I mean,
"Oh, we had the right guy,

15:46.610 --> 15:49.477
"but then your
son got kidnapped
from the kidnapper."

15:49.540 --> 15:51.269
That sounds like
what may have happened.

15:51.350 --> 15:54.046
Lutz was squatting
in that apartment,
by the way.

15:54.120 --> 15:55.940
Do we have a last
known address for Lutz?

15:56.020 --> 15:58.443
Yup, living with
his mom in Queens,
and as far as I can tell,

15:58.520 --> 16:00.681
unemployed for
the past six months.

16:00.760 --> 16:02.819
Which means
he had a lot of
free time on his hands.

16:02.890 --> 16:04.448
And was desperate for cash.

16:04.530 --> 16:08.819
Jay, see if you can find
any links between Lutz
and the Allens.

16:08.900 --> 16:10.390
Neighbors heard
a loud argument

16:10.470 --> 16:12.199
coming from
the apartment last night.

16:12.270 --> 16:14.329
Makes sense.
Inside looked like
a tornado hit it.

16:14.400 --> 16:16.265
Whoever killed Lutz
went at it with him.

16:16.340 --> 16:18.331
Did we find anything
else in that apartment?

16:18.410 --> 16:20.230
Got the boy's
medicine bottle.

16:20.310 --> 16:22.801
Which unfortunately means
he no longer has his pills.

16:22.880 --> 16:24.609
And a burner cell.

16:24.680 --> 16:26.443
I'll take a look.

16:26.510 --> 16:29.718
So we got two
compound depressed
skull fractures, blunt force.

16:29.780 --> 16:31.611
Well, there was
a broken table
right next to the body.

16:31.690 --> 16:32.941
Well, that'll do it.

16:33.020 --> 16:35.215
We got Le Fort and
mandibular fractures,

16:35.290 --> 16:37.588
multiple lacerations,
hematomas.

16:37.660 --> 16:39.981
Whoever did this
must have been
pretty pissed off.

16:40.060 --> 16:42.153
So now Lutz must have
put up a struggle, right?
Mmm-hmm.

16:42.230 --> 16:44.369
He must have fought back.
We got any blood
from the other guy?

16:44.430 --> 16:46.762
No, nothing yet,
but check this out.

16:46.830 --> 16:50.266
So I found a compound
chemical on Lutz's
clothing called acephate.

16:50.340 --> 16:52.069
Now, it's commonly
used by greenskeepers,

16:52.140 --> 16:53.801
you know,
in ballparks, golf courses,

16:53.880 --> 16:55.279
keeps the bugs away.

16:55.340 --> 16:58.002
Greenskeepers? Yeah,
no, Lutz was unemployed.

16:58.080 --> 16:59.707
Why acephate?

16:59.780 --> 17:02.146
So, what are we thinking?
Maybe the killer
worked with this stuff?

17:02.220 --> 17:03.915
Got some on Lutz
during the struggle?

17:03.990 --> 17:05.878
Sounds like you answered
your own question.

17:05.950 --> 17:08.180
I did.
Not gonna help him, though.

17:21.870 --> 17:23.201
Hey, boss?
Yeah?

17:23.270 --> 17:25.238
Lutz was definitely
tracking the Allens.

17:25.310 --> 17:28.074
His burner pinged
from several locations
around the City

17:28.140 --> 17:30.973
which matched directly
with the Allens'
whereabouts on those days.

17:31.050 --> 17:33.416
Okay. It'd be nice to know
who he was calling.

17:33.480 --> 17:36.574
We don't know who exactly,
but we do know he called
another burner phone,

17:36.650 --> 17:39.642
and only that phone
for the three weeks
leading up to the kidnapping.

17:39.720 --> 17:41.608
After that, nothing.

17:41.690 --> 17:44.454
So, whoever he was calling
was in on the plan.

17:44.530 --> 17:46.589
And maybe was
the guy who killed him.

17:46.660 --> 17:49.527
But why go through
the trouble of planning
a kidnapping with someone,

17:49.600 --> 17:51.488
only to kill the guy later?

17:51.570 --> 17:53.868
What if Lutz
and his killer planned
the kidnapping together?

17:53.940 --> 17:56.932
Right? Lutz's job
is to track the kid.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.662
But then _the bomb
scare gives him
a window of opportunity.

17:59.740 --> 18:02.379
He decides to act
without his partner.

18:02.440 --> 18:04.374
That way he doesn't have to
split the ransom money.

18:04.450 --> 18:06.839
Yeah, which really
pisses off the other guy.

18:06.910 --> 18:08.673
So Lutz goes to
ground in his apartment,

18:08.750 --> 18:11.184
hides Mason from us,
and from his former partner.

18:11.250 --> 18:12.945
So, if you're the man
with the plan, right,

18:13.020 --> 18:15.318
your former partner,
he double-crosses you,

18:15.390 --> 18:17.858
takes the kid,
where is the first
place you're gonna look?

18:17.930 --> 18:19.989
Where Lutz lived.
At his mom's place.

18:21.630 --> 18:24.064
Jason was always
getting into trouble.

18:24.130 --> 18:26.769
It was that public
school he went to.

18:26.830 --> 18:30.061
Mrs. Lutz,
did anybody
come by the house

18:30.140 --> 18:31.869
in the days before
your son was killed?

18:31.940 --> 18:33.271
Like who?

18:33.340 --> 18:36.639
Friends, girlfriend,
anything like that.

18:36.710 --> 18:39.577
No.
Nobody unusual?

18:39.650 --> 18:41.811
Oh, wait, wait.
There was someone.

18:41.880 --> 18:45.646
Uh... This man,
he was going door to door.

18:45.720 --> 18:49.053
He said there
was a rat problem
in the neighborhood.

18:49.120 --> 18:51.987
I told him I didn't have
any rats, just roaches.

18:52.060 --> 18:56.451
So, I let him in and
he sprayed a little bit.
Does that help?

18:56.530 --> 18:59.419
Sure, yeah.
Uh, did he give you a name?

18:59.500 --> 19:02.594
Oh! Here. Uh...

19:02.670 --> 19:06.436
He left his card.
Yes, that's it.

19:06.840 --> 19:08.171
Thanks.

19:10.110 --> 19:12.146
Now I can't ﬁnd Mason.

19:12.210 --> 19:13.313
It's okay.
Stay back.

19:17.750 --> 19:19.889
Mrs. Lutz, when did this man
come by your house?

19:19.950 --> 19:21.156
Yesterday morning.

19:21.220 --> 19:22.653
And he didn't
tell you his name?

19:22.720 --> 19:24.085
No.

19:24.160 --> 19:27.596
Well, come to think of it,
he kept asking about my son.

19:27.660 --> 19:30.720
He wanted to know
where he was
living these days.

19:30.800 --> 19:35.965
And I told him that
Jason was staying with
a friend out in Maspeth.

19:36.040 --> 19:38.065
Mrs. Lutz, do you mind
if I keep this card?

19:38.140 --> 19:39.402
Uh... No.

19:39.470 --> 19:42.132
Thank you.
You've been very helpful.

19:42.210 --> 19:43.347
Someone will show you out.
Okay?

19:46.910 --> 19:48.969
Right this way.

19:49.050 --> 19:52.383
That bomb scare in the park,
I saw a guy.

19:52.450 --> 19:54.953
He had this exact
logo on his shirt.

19:55.020 --> 19:57.250
Queen of
Hearts Exterminators.
Yeah.

19:57.330 --> 20:00.151
And Delina's report?
Acephate.

20:01.530 --> 20:02.758
An insecticide, Al.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.594
Okay, so Jason Lutz
got four calls from
a burner cell

20:07.670 --> 20:10.059
in the hour before
Mason was kidnapped.
Didn't take any of them.

20:10.140 --> 20:11.869
The exterminator
must have gotten nervous

20:11.940 --> 20:14.170
when he suspected
Lutz was scrapping the plan,

20:14.240 --> 20:15.468
taking the kid on his own.

20:15.540 --> 20:17.098
So he went to the park,
he didn't find them there,

20:17.180 --> 20:18.704
then he goes to
Jason's mom's house.

20:18.780 --> 20:21.419
She gives him Maspeth.
He must have known the place.

20:24.020 --> 20:27.456
It looks like
they got 15 employees
at the exterminator company.

20:29.420 --> 20:30.728
It's okay.
Stay back.

20:34.300 --> 20:35.289
Right there. Him.

20:37.970 --> 20:39.926
Name's Jim Garrett.
Got an address over
in Queens.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.536
Hillside Ave.
Let's go.

20:53.010 --> 20:54.568
Ano_ther ranso_m
call just came in,

20:54.650 --> 20:56.641
thi_s_time for
$3 million in cash,

20:56.720 --> 20:59.848
and a threat
on the boy's life if
Allen doesn't pay up.

20:59.920 --> 21:01.558
Well,
Garrett already killed Lutz.

21:01.620 --> 21:03.451
What's to stop him
from killing Mason?

21:04.760 --> 21:06.318
No sign of the boy?

21:13.470 --> 21:14.767
Who is this?

21:14.840 --> 21:15.989
MAN:
I have your son.

21:19.670 --> 21:20.978
Please don't hurt him.

21:21.040 --> 21:22.905
MAN: I'll call back with
further instructions.

21:22.980 --> 21:25.540
No cops, no FBI.

21:25.610 --> 21:28.147
KEN: I want to
speak to my son.
I want to know that he's okay.

21:29.480 --> 21:31.448
Al?
Yeah?

21:31.520 --> 21:34.409
This trophy,
it belongs to Kenneth Allen.

21:34.490 --> 21:39.086
He was in Allen's house.
I saw a bunch of these
behind his desk.

21:39.160 --> 21:41.628
One was missing.
This one.

21:41.700 --> 21:43.895
Why would Garrett
steal a worthless trophy?

21:46.600 --> 21:48.795
Because it wasn't
worthless to him.

21:48.870 --> 21:51.737
DENNY:
We got eyes on the suspect.
He's near the building.

21:58.210 --> 22:00.201
Hey, put the camera
on those garages.

22:02.780 --> 22:05.817
DENNY: Signs of life
in the garage, in the garage.

22:09.790 --> 22:13.419
Police! Freeze!
I got him. Go. Go, go, go!

22:17.900 --> 22:18.889
Mason?

22:29.540 --> 22:31.804
Jim Garrett,
you're under arrest.

22:31.880 --> 22:33.302
I was just gonna
walk my dog.

22:33.380 --> 22:34.938
Okay, first of all,
that thing is not a dog,

22:35.020 --> 22:36.419
all right?
What is that?
A wolverine?

22:36.480 --> 22:38.038
You have no
grounds to arrest me.

22:38.120 --> 22:39.781
We'll start with
cruelty to animals.

22:39.850 --> 22:42.353
We'll work our
way up to kidnapping
when we get downtown.

22:46.930 --> 22:48.397
We checked the entire
apartment building,

22:48.460 --> 22:49.654
the surrounding area,
nothing.

22:49.730 --> 22:51.618
No sign of Mason.
All right, keep looking.

22:51.700 --> 22:53.190
SANDRA: She just went in.

22:53.270 --> 22:55.158
All right. What do
we know about Garrett?

22:55.240 --> 22:58.539
Recently divorced.
Fallen on some pretty
rough financial times.

22:58.610 --> 23:02.000
Actually, never really had
good financial times either.

23:02.080 --> 23:03.604
How recently divorced?

23:03.680 --> 23:05.648
JAY: Finalized a year ago.
Could have set him off.

23:05.710 --> 23:08.770
Looks like his wife was
the only good thing
going for the guy,

23:08.850 --> 23:11.944
uh, but when
Garrett's life went south,
she headed out west.

23:12.020 --> 23:13.908
I've been trying to
reach her, but no luck.

23:13.990 --> 23:17.357
Apparently
she's out in Moab, Utah,
living in a yurt.

23:17.430 --> 23:18.852
Criminal record?

23:18.930 --> 23:21.148
From what I can see,
guy's clean.

23:21.230 --> 23:22.595
No, not really.

23:22.660 --> 23:25.163
I mean, we still have
a strong case for burglary.

23:25.230 --> 23:28.199
Right? He must have
broken into the Allens'
to get that award.

23:28.270 --> 23:29.999
Family is
on their way in.

23:32.240 --> 23:33.332
CARRIE: Jason Lutz.

23:34.780 --> 23:36.407
If you say so.

23:36.480 --> 23:37.970
What? You've never
seen him before?

23:38.050 --> 23:40.006
No.

23:40.080 --> 23:41.240
That's really quite
interesting because
he was found murdered,

23:41.320 --> 23:42.810
and I think you killed him.

23:45.690 --> 23:49.478
You're throwing some
pretty wild accusations
at me here, okay?

23:51.560 --> 23:55.052
I... I murdered someone?
I... I kidnapped a little boy?

23:55.130 --> 23:56.222
That's right.

24:03.240 --> 24:04.605
You know, I saw

24:06.440 --> 24:08.374
the kid on Channel 2.

24:08.440 --> 24:10.169
A nice-looking boy.
Hope they find him.

24:10.240 --> 24:11.605
I'm gonna find him.

24:11.680 --> 24:13.477
Would you make it quick?
So I can get out of here.

24:14.850 --> 24:16.613
Yeah, that's not how
it's gonna work, Jim.

24:19.420 --> 24:22.150
You know, I...

24:22.220 --> 24:26.657
I understand that
this is a big case
for you people.

24:26.730 --> 24:28.152
I get it.
Yeah.

24:28.230 --> 24:29.652
But you brought me down here
without any proof.

24:29.730 --> 24:31.095
I haven't done
anything wrong.

24:33.070 --> 24:35.231
What kind of
police work is that?

24:36.370 --> 24:38.338
You've got the wrong guy.

24:38.410 --> 24:39.707
Oh, my God.

24:40.710 --> 24:42.007
Do you know him?

24:42.080 --> 24:43.809
KEN: That's Jim.

24:43.880 --> 24:45.700
Jim Garrett.

24:45.780 --> 24:48.943
We were in grad school
together for a while.

24:49.020 --> 24:50.988
Is there a story in that?

24:51.050 --> 24:53.689
Jim couldn't hack it.
He dropped out.

24:53.760 --> 24:55.352
_When's the last
time you saw him?

24:55.420 --> 24:58.924
I haven't_ seen him.
Not once in 25 years.

25:00.700 --> 25:02.759
Carrie, he knows Allen.

25:02.830 --> 25:04.991
They were in school together.

25:07.100 --> 25:09.432
What's your
relationship to
Kenneth Allen?

25:15.080 --> 25:17.298
Ken Allen? Well.

25:18.580 --> 25:22.448
Whoo! Oh, there's a blast
from the past.

25:22.520 --> 25:27.014
Uh, well, Ken Allen.
Well, you know,
we were good friends.

25:27.090 --> 25:28.682
I haven't seen him
in a while.

25:28.760 --> 25:31.729
So you weren't aware
that _his son is
the missmg boy?

25:33.900 --> 25:35.788
Oh, no.

25:37.230 --> 25:40.199
No. Wow, no.

25:40.270 --> 25:43.706
Poor Ken,
he must be really
suffering right now.

25:44.910 --> 25:46.366
Well...

25:46.440 --> 25:49.477
Funny, in a way.
I can understand his pain.

25:51.380 --> 25:52.608
How's that?

25:53.620 --> 25:54.917
I...

25:56.320 --> 25:58.242
I know how much it hurts

25:59.920 --> 26:01.911
to have something
taken away from you.

26:01.990 --> 26:03.014
Right.

26:04.790 --> 26:08.396
Which is why
you took something
away from him, right?

26:08.460 --> 26:09.688
I had nothing to do with it.

26:09.760 --> 26:12.160
I'm talking about the trophy.

26:14.040 --> 26:15.689
The Prometheus
SCIence trophy.

26:17.140 --> 26:19.108
Awarded to Hudson
University's most

26:19.170 --> 26:21.832
brilliant Science
and Engineering student.

26:24.580 --> 26:25.899
That?

26:25.980 --> 26:28.574
I mean, I bet you thought
you should have won it. Right?

26:28.650 --> 26:30.618
Look.

26:30.690 --> 26:33.443
Ken was,
you know, a great guy,

26:33.520 --> 26:37.854
but, well,
he was always just a bit dim
when it came to the science.

26:38.990 --> 26:40.548
If I'm being honest,

26:40.630 --> 26:44.293
he was always
a couple of steps behind
when we worked together.

26:44.370 --> 26:48.431
I had to,
you know, carry the ball,
so to speak.

26:48.500 --> 26:51.435
That's ridiculous.
He's delusional.

26:51.510 --> 26:52.909
But you two
did work together?

26:52.970 --> 26:56.269
Yes. I mean,
nothing groundbreaking,
I was in my 205.

26:56.340 --> 26:58.274
We were just scratching
the surface back then.

26:58.350 --> 27:00.102
And then you became
Kenneth Allen,

27:00.180 --> 27:03.172
CEO of one of the
biggest chemical
corporations in New York,

27:03.250 --> 27:06.378
and he became Jim Garrett,
exterminator.

27:06.450 --> 27:07.849
And that's my fault?

27:07.920 --> 27:09.319
Not saying that.

27:09.390 --> 27:11.881
I'm just trying to understand
what makes this guy tick.

27:11.960 --> 27:16.693
It was the discoveries
I made after grad school
that put me on the map,

27:16.760 --> 27:19.524
not some Bunsen
burner experiments
in a college lab.

27:19.600 --> 27:20.931
He's insane.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.230
CARRIE: What were you
doing in his house?

27:23.300 --> 27:25.359
Well, they had
a bit of a bug problem,

27:25.440 --> 27:27.772
and, you know,
they called
the pest control company.

27:27.840 --> 27:29.705
I happen to work there,

27:29.780 --> 27:32.806
so when I saw their
request for serwces,

27:32.880 --> 27:35.371
I thought I'd step in

27:35.450 --> 27:37.418
and rid them
of their worries.

27:38.390 --> 27:39.789
So, what, did you just

27:41.290 --> 27:43.508
do your work
and then snatch the trophy,

27:43.590 --> 27:46.354
walk out with it
on your way out?

27:46.430 --> 27:48.455
I thought it would look good
on my living room table.

27:48.530 --> 27:51.067
You do know
burglary is a crime?

27:51.130 --> 27:53.667
Actually, it's not burglary

27:53.740 --> 27:57.699
unless you enter the home
with the intent to _
commit a felony therein.

27:57.770 --> 28:01.809
"Therein"? Wow!
What are you, a damn lawyer?

28:01.880 --> 28:03.370
You work for a bug company.

28:05.680 --> 28:07.671
You're a smart guy, uh, Jim?

28:07.750 --> 28:11.186
The best you're
gonna get on me
is petty theft.

28:11.250 --> 28:13.787
I'll do a little community
service, I'll be fine.

28:15.420 --> 28:18.389
Now, how about you
let me go home?

28:18.460 --> 28:21.293
The only place
you're going is to jail.

28:23.200 --> 28:26.522
I know you murdered
Jason Lutz, I know
you kidnapped Mason.

28:28.700 --> 28:30.839
Well, you're right
about one thing.

28:32.140 --> 28:34.335
I am a pretty smart guy.

28:34.410 --> 28:38.278
I figure any lawyer
worth his salt

28:39.710 --> 28:41.211
will have no problem
getting me off.

28:43.280 --> 28:47.341
It's probably pretty difficult
to get a conviction

28:47.420 --> 28:50.059
when you already
have a prime suspect.

28:51.130 --> 28:54.099
Especially one who
happens to be dead,

28:54.160 --> 28:55.957
like, uh, what's his name?

28:56.030 --> 28:57.019
Uh...

28:57.700 --> 28:59.463
Lutz.

29:01.900 --> 29:04.300
Juries, when they get
confused...

29:04.370 --> 29:07.259
"Boop boop!"

29:07.340 --> 29:10.969
If there's a human side
to you at all,
I want you to hear me.

29:11.050 --> 29:14.645
That little boy
needs medication
or he's going to die.

29:16.880 --> 29:18.780
Tell me where he is.

29:20.920 --> 29:22.854
I don't know where he is.

29:24.760 --> 29:28.150
But, speaking hypothetically,

29:28.230 --> 29:34.089
wherever he is,
exposed to the elements,
no food or water,

29:34.170 --> 29:36.889
I don't see little Mason
survwing much longer.

29:39.870 --> 29:43.704
It's a shame that
his clever father

29:43.780 --> 29:46.647
couldn't devise _
some way to save him.

29:50.820 --> 29:53.084
SANDRA:
You can't be serious.
I'm completely serious.

29:53.150 --> 29:56.119
Put Kenneth Allen
in the room with
Jim Garrett.

29:56.190 --> 29:59.626
That's extremely unorthodox,
even for you,

29:59.690 --> 30:01.351
not to mention it's illegal.

30:01.430 --> 30:03.864
Look, he can stonewall me
all day.

30:03.930 --> 30:05.591
And he's right.
What do we have?

30:05.670 --> 30:08.696
I mean,
the closest thing we've got
is that he lied about Lutz

30:08.770 --> 30:10.909
because he left his card
at Lutz's mother's house.

30:10.970 --> 30:12.369
And there's
the theft of the trophy.

30:12.440 --> 30:14.305
That's all it is,
petty theft.

30:14.380 --> 30:19.101
_ This entire case _
against him is Circumstantial
and he knows it.

30:19.180 --> 30:21.068
This guy is a criminal.
He's guilty.

30:21.150 --> 30:23.118
I know he's guilty
but Mason is gonna die!

30:23.180 --> 30:25.045
He needs his medication...
She's right.

30:25.120 --> 30:29.079
If Jim Garrett can
see his old friend
face to face, in the flesh,

30:29.160 --> 30:30.309
he might make a mistake.

30:31.790 --> 30:33.018
All right.

30:33.090 --> 30:35.194
I will bring it up to Allen.

30:35.260 --> 30:38.195
But if this goes south,
I'm pulling him out.

30:44.640 --> 30:46.562
You sure you know
what you're doing?

30:46.640 --> 30:48.699
No.

30:48.780 --> 30:50.407
But it's
the only chance we got.

31:03.520 --> 31:04.953
Well, hello, Ken.

31:09.360 --> 31:10.657
It's been a while.

31:10.730 --> 31:11.765
Yes.

31:12.870 --> 31:14.565
Long time.

31:16.900 --> 31:18.765
Yeah, too long.

31:18.840 --> 31:20.000
How's the family?

31:20.870 --> 31:22.371
You know how they are.

31:22.440 --> 31:24.340
Oh, yeah.

31:25.680 --> 31:27.102
Sorry to hear about your boy.

31:28.950 --> 31:31.817
Must be quite a shock.
Hmm... Must...

31:33.590 --> 31:35.353
Must hurt really bad.

31:37.060 --> 31:38.084
Jim...

31:38.160 --> 31:41.129
It surprises me though,
to be honest,

31:43.430 --> 31:46.593
that someone of your success,

31:46.670 --> 31:48.831
big-time
innovator like yourself,

31:48.900 --> 31:54.008
would have _time to care about
such things as family.

31:55.240 --> 31:56.673
He's all I care about.

31:57.810 --> 31:59.300
You've changed.

31:59.380 --> 32:01.245
How so?

32:01.320 --> 32:06.587
Hmm. Well, you know,
you used to be so
forward-thinking,

32:06.650 --> 32:10.359
driven to make it,
change the world,
all that stuff.

32:10.860 --> 32:12.157
Well,

32:13.630 --> 32:16.326
people can change.

32:16.400 --> 32:18.698
I suppose you think
I've changed.

32:18.770 --> 32:20.590
I don't know.

32:22.170 --> 32:25.901
I remember we had
a few laughs in college,

32:25.970 --> 32:27.835
but it's been a while.

32:27.910 --> 32:30.708
Oh. Yes, we did.

32:30.780 --> 32:35.342
We had some good times, Ken.
We did.

32:35.420 --> 32:39.015
Remember
Mr. Harrison's class?
You remember that?

32:39.090 --> 32:42.651
When I, when I rigged
the titration lab?

32:43.790 --> 32:46.350
He was not expecting HDL.

32:47.760 --> 32:51.025
I still remember
the look on his face.

32:51.100 --> 32:54.092
But you kept a secret though.
You didn't turn me in.

32:54.170 --> 32:56.593
We were lab partners,
we were supposed to
look out for each other.

32:57.300 --> 32:58.733
That's right.

33:00.440 --> 33:02.772
We were supposed to
look out for each other.

33:02.840 --> 33:03.932
Mmm-hmm.

33:05.610 --> 33:07.840
Like, when you

33:08.880 --> 33:12.247
took credit for
all of our work.

33:12.320 --> 33:14.311
I don't know what
you're talking about.

33:14.390 --> 33:17.018
Prometheus?

33:17.090 --> 33:18.728
Thief of Fire.

33:18.790 --> 33:20.826
Does it ring a bell, Ken?

33:22.830 --> 33:24.661
You stole

33:24.730 --> 33:28.063
my ideas and you pawned
them off as your own.

33:28.140 --> 33:29.459
What ideas?

33:30.640 --> 33:32.403
No, tell me.

33:42.280 --> 33:44.384
You know just
as well as I do, Ken.

33:44.450 --> 33:46.008
No, I don't.

33:46.850 --> 33:49.387
I wanna know.

33:49.460 --> 33:51.849
Tell me,
what did you contribute?

33:51.930 --> 33:53.352
Formulas?

33:53.430 --> 33:54.556
Equations?

33:56.060 --> 34:01.191
You are still
a pompous ass, Ken.
You were then, you are now.

34:01.270 --> 34:04.103
Even with your son's life
hanging in the balance.

34:04.170 --> 34:05.967
Carrie, no,
I want him out.
No, not yet.

34:06.040 --> 34:07.462
I want him out.
Not yet, not yet.

34:07.540 --> 34:09.007
You didn't take
the risks that I did.

34:09.080 --> 34:12.777
You sit there accusing me
of stealing from you?

34:12.850 --> 34:15.011
Ken,
you haven't changed a bit.

34:15.080 --> 34:17.640
Neither have you.
You're still the same
scared little man.

34:17.720 --> 34:19.915
You took what was mine!

34:19.990 --> 34:22.356
You are pathetic!

34:22.420 --> 34:25.150
You were afraid
of the dark!

34:25.230 --> 34:28.722
You wouldn't even
get your feet wet!
Do you remember that?

34:31.670 --> 34:33.558
Go, go, go.
You took it!

34:33.630 --> 34:36.167
You tell me where my son is!

34:36.240 --> 34:37.298
Tell me!

34:38.270 --> 34:40.568
You tell me where my son is!

34:43.510 --> 34:45.774
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

34:45.850 --> 34:47.203
It's okay, honey.
You're just trying to help.

34:47.280 --> 34:48.975
Yeah, and I made it worse.
No.

34:49.050 --> 34:50.574
You did great. Now listen.

34:50.650 --> 34:52.015
You said something in there,

34:52.090 --> 34:54.115
that he was
afraid of the dark,
afraid to get his feet wet.

34:54.190 --> 34:55.555
What did you mean?

34:55.620 --> 34:57.349
Well, a lot of
what we were doing,

34:57.420 --> 34:59.684
working with
combustible materials,

34:59.760 --> 35:03.150
highly flammable compounds,
testing ignition points,

35:03.230 --> 35:05.596
you couldn't always
use the school labs.

35:05.670 --> 35:07.262
So you two would go
somewhere?

35:10.170 --> 35:12.502
places where
people couldn't hear us,
people wouldn't bother us.

35:12.570 --> 35:13.935
We finally found a spot,

35:14.010 --> 35:16.001
but you had to walk through
abandoned sewage tunnels.

35:16.080 --> 35:17.900
And there was
water in the tunnels?

35:17.980 --> 35:21.108
Yeah, and Jim
was afraid to step in it.
It became kind of a joke.

35:21.180 --> 35:23.444
Jim was afraid to
get his feet wet.

35:23.520 --> 35:25.988
_Said _the water was_
SWImming With bacteria.

35:26.050 --> 35:27.608
Can you tell us
where that was?

35:27.690 --> 35:31.353
Some factory.
I don't remember where,
exactly.

35:31.430 --> 35:32.852
No sign of the boy?

35:37.560 --> 35:40.358
Listen, we're gonna
keep working on Garrett.

35:40.430 --> 35:42.637
We will find your son,
I promise you.

35:44.210 --> 35:46.269
Please. _
Can you come With me,
please?

35:49.180 --> 35:51.000
Al, I know Where he is.

35:51.080 --> 35:54.072
Brook Glassworks,
building 23.

35:54.150 --> 35:57.779
Jim Garrett took a picture
with his Wife posing out
front of that building.

35:57.850 --> 36:01.650
He must have told her
that that's where him
and Allen did all the work

36:01.720 --> 36:02.857
that Allen took credit for.

36:04.020 --> 36:05.453
I'll stay with Garrett.

36:05.530 --> 36:07.350
He's already rattled.
He might give us
something else.

36:07.430 --> 36:09.057
You go, but listen to me.

36:09.130 --> 36:12.258
When you get down there,
I'll be in your ear.

36:12.330 --> 36:14.195
No place
I'd rather have you.

36:15.800 --> 36:16.892
Go get the boy.

36:25.980 --> 36:28.107
(IN DISTINCT RADIO
CONVERSATIONS)

36:30.120 --> 36:31.417
The building is not safe.

36:31.490 --> 36:32.514
That's Why I
gotta get in there.

36:32.590 --> 36:33.841
We have to shore it up.
We need an hour.

36:33.920 --> 36:35.251
I don't have an hour!

36:44.770 --> 36:46.226
Mason!

36:49.870 --> 36:51.167
Mason!

36:57.280 --> 36:58.872
Mason!

37:03.120 --> 37:06.044
Oh, boy. Okay.

37:10.920 --> 37:12.182
Mason!

37:12.260 --> 37:14.922
I'm a police officer.
Can you hear me?

37:19.000 --> 37:20.695
Al?

37:20.770 --> 37:23.568
I'm right with you.
What do you see?

37:24.740 --> 37:26.662
A lot of tunnels.

37:45.730 --> 37:47.186
Carrie, What is it?
Do you see something?

37:58.170 --> 37:59.569
Jelly beans.

37:59.640 --> 38:01.369
AL: What?

38:01.440 --> 38:04.238
Jelly beans, Al.
I saw them at
Lutz's apartment.

38:05.950 --> 38:07.349
Mason's?

38:07.410 --> 38:08.946
Lutz must have
given them to him.

38:18.590 --> 38:20.922
He likes to read, huh?

38:20.990 --> 38:22.855
Hansel and Gretel?

38:22.930 --> 38:25.421
Grimm's Fairy Tales.
That's his favorite.

38:25.500 --> 38:26.922
Way to go, Mason.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.230
Al?

38:29.300 --> 38:32.269
Remember Hansel and Gretel?
Trail of breadcrumbs?

38:32.340 --> 38:33.864
Well, Mason's
leaving his own trail.

38:33.940 --> 38:35.498
Carrie, you there?

38:36.480 --> 38:38.277
Carrie, I'm losing you.

38:39.450 --> 38:40.439
Carrie?

38:47.750 --> 38:49.388
Mason.

38:49.460 --> 38:52.054
It's okay. It's okay.

38:55.260 --> 38:56.727
Listen to me.

38:56.800 --> 39:00.395
I'm a police officer,
and I'm here to help you.

39:00.470 --> 39:03.792
The other man_ said he was
a police officer, too,
but he was bad.

39:05.670 --> 39:07.661
Well, I'm not bad, Mason.

39:07.740 --> 39:12.768
You know, I have your mom
and your dad outside.

39:12.850 --> 39:15.375
And they're waiting for you
and they miss you.

39:15.450 --> 39:16.917
Now, listen to me.

39:16.980 --> 39:18.982
I want you to step forward
and jump into my arms,

39:19.050 --> 39:20.813
and I'm gonna take
you right to them, okay?

39:26.390 --> 39:27.459
I'm scared.

39:27.530 --> 39:30.590
I need you to trust me.
I need you to be brave.

39:30.660 --> 39:31.922
I don't wanna let go.

39:39.970 --> 39:42.279
You like superheroes,
right, Mason?

39:42.340 --> 39:43.773
Yeah, a lot.

39:46.280 --> 39:49.443
Mason, you know,
they get scared
too sometimes.

39:49.520 --> 39:51.317
They do?
Yeah.

39:51.380 --> 39:55.180
Because being brave,
it's really, really hard.

39:56.760 --> 39:59.228
You know What
makes me brave, Mason?

40:00.360 --> 40:01.429
My badge.

40:02.730 --> 40:04.129
Really?
Yeah.

40:04.200 --> 40:07.567
Now, I'm gonna give it to you,
and it's gonna make you brave.

40:09.900 --> 40:10.935
Here you go.

40:12.170 --> 40:13.899
I want you
to jump to me,

40:13.970 --> 40:15.779
and we can be
heroes together.

40:15.840 --> 40:18.229
You can do this.

40:18.310 --> 40:19.948
I need you to jump to me.

40:21.820 --> 40:23.708
Okay. Go! Go!

40:32.190 --> 40:33.350
Okay.

40:33.430 --> 40:34.795
MASON: Mom!

40:36.800 --> 40:38.153
Oh, my God!

40:42.000 --> 40:43.467
Okay.
GWEN: Baby.

40:46.210 --> 40:47.302
Oh, thank you.

40:47.370 --> 40:49.008
You're welcome.

40:49.080 --> 40:50.638
My sweet boy.
My sweet boy.
Mr. and Mrs. Allen...

40:50.710 --> 40:52.109
Right this way, please.

40:53.480 --> 40:55.277
Carrie, you there?

40:55.350 --> 40:58.217
Yeah, Al! I thought
you'd given up on me.

40:59.720 --> 41:02.154
Neven
I heard Mason's safe.

41:03.290 --> 41:04.780
Great work.

41:04.860 --> 41:07.420
Well, it really helped
having your voice in my ear.

41:07.490 --> 41:09.355
Need anything?
Oh, I don't know.

41:09.430 --> 41:11.352
A foot rub and
a tub of tequila.

41:12.200 --> 41:14.020
Done and done.

41:14.100 --> 41:15.590
Carrie.
Yeah?

41:15.670 --> 41:17.991
Family wants
to talk to you.

41:18.070 --> 41:19.503
Okay.

41:22.710 --> 41:24.849
Hey.

41:24.910 --> 41:27.640
I don't know how
we can ever thank you.

41:27.710 --> 41:30.270
Well, Mason did
most of the work.

41:30.350 --> 41:32.215
Can I talk
to the police lady?

41:32.290 --> 41:34.087
Sure.
Please.

41:35.590 --> 41:37.148
Hey, how you feeling?

41:37.220 --> 41:38.858
Good. Maybe a little tired.

41:38.930 --> 41:42.297
Well, I'm not surprised.
You went through a lot.

41:42.360 --> 41:46.194
Hey, What you did
with the jelly beans,
that was really smart.

41:46.270 --> 41:48.636
Thank you for
saving my life.

41:48.700 --> 41:50.588
Well, it's part of my job.

41:50.670 --> 41:53.468
The best part of my job.
You know that?

41:53.540 --> 41:57.431
Maybe when I grow up,
I can be a police
officer just like you.

41:57.510 --> 42:00.900
I think you would make
a great police officer, Mason.

42:00.980 --> 42:02.743
You call me when
you're ready, okay?

42:02.820 --> 42:04.014
Okay?

42:04.820 --> 42:06.014
Hey, thank you.

42:06.090 --> 42:07.717
Why are you thanking me?
