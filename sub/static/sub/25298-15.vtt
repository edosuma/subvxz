08:49.819 --> 08:51.701
Too wild!
Too wild!

08:53.323 --> 08:55.655
No, Ms. Cho,
you can't leave yet.

08:55.655 --> 08:57.537
I deserve to be
employee of the month.

08:57.537 --> 08:58.618
Please hear me out.

08:58.618 --> 09:00.080
[Tilly]
Attention, everybody!

09:00.080 --> 09:01.871
My name is Cricket Green!

09:01.871 --> 09:05.755
And I don't think
about the consequences
of my actions!

09:05.755 --> 09:07.167
AHHHHH!!!

09:07.167 --> 09:09.008
I don't care
about health codes

09:09.008 --> 09:11.721
or personal space!

09:11.721 --> 09:13.763
-Aw, come on.
-What the heck?

09:13.763 --> 09:15.345
And I like to dance!

09:15.345 --> 09:16.846
♪ Bingo bingo bang-go ♪

09:16.846 --> 09:18.678
♪ I don't give a dango. ♪

09:18.678 --> 09:20.770
Rrrrnngghhh.

09:20.770 --> 09:21.681
Ta-da!

09:21.681 --> 09:24.144
This is not what Big Coffee
stands for.

09:24.144 --> 09:26.526
Apologies for
the disturbance, everyone!

09:26.526 --> 09:28.778
If your food or beverage
was tampered with,

09:28.778 --> 09:30.860
we will happily replace it!

09:30.860 --> 09:32.902
Hrng?
Hrmmm...

09:34.654 --> 09:37.157
Ah, it's good to be back.

09:37.157 --> 09:38.788
But I don't get it, Tilly.
You had it all!

09:38.788 --> 09:40.540
Why'd you give it up?

09:40.540 --> 09:43.753
I realized Cricket's job
isn't to be a good employee.

09:43.753 --> 09:46.336
It's to make you
look better by comparison!

09:46.336 --> 09:49.048
Huh, that's kind of
a harsh thing to learn
about yourself,

09:49.048 --> 09:51.801
but I guess I appreciate
Cricket a little more.

09:51.801 --> 09:54.844
-Then my job here is done.
-No it's not.

09:54.844 --> 09:57.267
You still have three hours
left on your shift.

09:57.267 --> 09:59.389
This is what Cricket
would've wanted.

09:59.389 --> 10:00.890
Aah!

10:11.731 --> 10:13.403
[dog howling]

10:13.403 --> 10:15.615
Phoenix!
She's here to save us!

10:29.879 --> 10:30.920

10:30.920 --> 10:32.922
[Remy] Yay! Phoenix!

10:32.922 --> 10:34.844
Mis-ter Green!
Mis-ter Green!

10:34.844 --> 10:36.556
I filmed the whole thing!

10:36.556 --> 10:37.717
Oooh!
It's got ten thousand likes!

10:37.717 --> 10:39.349
It's a gif!
It's a meme!

10:39.349 --> 10:41.100
The internet loves it!
Oh wait, they hate it.

10:41.100 --> 10:42.522
It's over.
But I still like it!

10:42.522 --> 10:44.063
You did pretty good
on that run, Dad.

10:44.063 --> 10:46.316
Thanks, son. It was
actually kind of a rush.

10:46.316 --> 10:47.977
Hoo!

10:47.977 --> 10:49.899
I think I understand you a
little better now, Cricket!

10:49.899 --> 10:50.900
We all do!

10:50.900 --> 10:52.772
A little too well
if you ask me.

10:52.772 --> 10:54.824
Ha-ha.
Thanks, family.

10:54.824 --> 10:56.866
You're all
real good eggs.

10:56.866 --> 10:58.238
Achoo!

10:58.238 --> 10:59.779
[groans]

11:01.621 --> 11:03.243
Ahhhh!

11:03.243 --> 11:05.625
[Cricket]
I am the tomato-nator.

11:05.625 --> 11:06.836
The red destroyer.

11:06.836 --> 11:07.787
And I.

11:07.787 --> 11:08.788
Will. Not.

11:08.788 --> 11:09.789
Stop!

11:10.790 --> 11:12.001
[Bill] Ah!

11:12.001 --> 11:13.673
Nice day for
the farmers' market!

11:13.673 --> 11:16.796
Our tomatoes are gonna
fly off the shelves.

11:16.796 --> 11:19.599
Especially with my expert
marketing techniques!

11:19.599 --> 11:22.141
No one can resist
the allure of a sign.

11:22.141 --> 11:24.854
And I came up
with the tomato prices.

11:24.854 --> 11:25.855
We're gonna be rich.

11:25.855 --> 11:27.807
No, sweetie!

11:27.807 --> 11:29.899
We're not one of those corporate
stores that gouges people.

11:29.899 --> 11:31.811
That's the whole point
of the farmer's market.

11:31.811 --> 11:33.273
To have a place
for the little guys.

11:33.273 --> 11:36.025
I didn't come here
for all this tomato talk!

11:36.025 --> 11:38.818
I came here to find
a pepper so hot

11:38.818 --> 11:41.871
it'll be worthy
of my 10 Alarm Chili.

11:41.871 --> 11:43.913
I'd be happy to show you
where the pepper farmers--

11:43.913 --> 11:44.914
[Gramma]
We're leavin' now!

11:44.914 --> 11:45.915
Oh! All right, Ma!

11:45.915 --> 11:47.957
You two stay outta trouble!

11:47.957 --> 11:48.918
And take care of the booth!

11:48.918 --> 11:50.590
You got it, big guy!

11:50.590 --> 11:53.213
I shall defend the booth
with my life if I have to!

11:53.213 --> 11:57.006
I will strike down any foes
who dare cross our path!

11:57.006 --> 11:58.968
Well, look who's
minding the booth.

11:58.968 --> 12:00.840
Chip Whistler?!

12:00.840 --> 12:03.683
That's right, green beans.
It's me, Chip Whistler!

12:03.683 --> 12:05.975
Manager of Wholesome Foods
Grocery Store

12:05.975 --> 12:07.687
and modern Renaissance man.

12:07.687 --> 12:10.059
Last time I saw you,
didn't you chip your tooth

12:10.059 --> 12:12.692
Uh, yeah, thanks to you..

12:12.692 --> 12:14.153
But a quick trip
to the dentist,

12:14.153 --> 12:16.356
and these babies
are as good as new.

12:16.356 --> 12:18.238
Good ol' composite resin.

12:18.238 --> 12:21.741
-A dentistry miracle.
-Shhhh.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.863
What are you doing at the
farmers' market anyway?

12:23.863 --> 12:26.866
I'm here with Wholesome Foods'
brand-new "market booth"...

12:26.866 --> 12:29.499
and I just wanted to come around
and see my<i> competish.</i>

12:29.499 --> 12:31.291
What? Wholesome Foods
is a grocery store.

12:31.291 --> 12:32.832
He can't sell here.

12:32.832 --> 12:35.044
Huh, that's weird.
'Cause I already am.

12:35.044 --> 12:37.637
That's business, kid.
Nothing personal.

12:37.637 --> 12:40.009
Well, kind of is.
Smell ya later.

12:40.009 --> 12:42.221
Grrr. Tilly, we have
to stop Chip!

12:42.221 --> 12:44.594
Papa told us not to
get into any trouble!

12:44.594 --> 12:47.096
Tilly, Dad told us
to protect the booth!

12:47.096 --> 12:48.848
The farmer's market
is for the little guy.

12:48.848 --> 12:51.731
We need to take him down
before he takes us down.

12:51.731 --> 12:53.693
You make a solid argument.

12:53.693 --> 12:55.855
I'm in. But we have
to do this smart.

12:55.855 --> 12:57.026
I'll get into character.

12:57.026 --> 12:59.108
Ah the pepper district.

12:59.108 --> 12:59.899
If you want to find
a hot pepper,

12:59.899 --> 13:01.401
this is where you find it.

13:01.401 --> 13:03.783
Hush yer mouth!
Target acquired.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.905
Free sample?
Free spicy pepper sample?

13:05.905 --> 13:08.408
Gimme that!
[gnoshing]

13:08.408 --> 13:11.331
You call this spicy?!
You're fired!

13:11.331 --> 13:14.043
[chuckles] Don't worry,
she can't fire you!

13:14.043 --> 13:15.795
At least
I don't think she can.

13:15.795 --> 13:18.548
-Sample some scorchers?
-Mmm, mediocre.

13:18.548 --> 13:21.090
-Hottest peppers on the market.
-Baby food.

13:21.090 --> 13:23.473
-These will burn you right up.
-Forgettable.

13:23.473 --> 13:25.345
You gotta be kiddin' me.

13:25.345 --> 13:28.558
Isn't there anyone out here
who can bring the heat?!

13:28.558 --> 13:33.272
Did somebody call
for heeeeeeat?

13:33.272 --> 13:35.395
-What the--
-I'm goin' with him.

13:35.395 --> 13:38.237
Step right up
to Wholesome Foods!

13:38.237 --> 13:39.939
And don't worry,
everybody...

13:39.939 --> 13:42.782
There's plenty of room back here
for all of your money!

13:42.782 --> 13:44.033
Oh thank goodness!

13:44.033 --> 13:46.155
[Cricket] Attention Wholesome
Foods customers!

13:46.155 --> 13:48.077
Put down your wads of cash!

13:48.077 --> 13:49.949
I come bearing terrible news!

13:49.949 --> 13:54.754
Wholesome Foods produce
is haunted!

13:54.754 --> 13:57.457
So head on over
to Green Family Farms!

13:57.457 --> 13:59.088
We're not haunted!

13:59.088 --> 14:01.921
-[mimicking ghost]
-[gasps]

14:01.921 --> 14:06.055
Beware! Bewaaa-- Oof!

14:06.055 --> 14:07.847
Thank you.

14:07.847 --> 14:10.970
[Tilly] I am the ghost
of Mrs. Wholesome!

14:10.970 --> 14:12.772
I've come back
to teach you

14:12.772 --> 14:14.063
the true meaning
of Christmas...

14:14.063 --> 14:16.976
and also to haunt your food!

14:16.976 --> 14:18.237
Haunted. Haunted.

14:18.237 --> 14:19.779
You're really haunted.

14:19.779 --> 14:23.032
Clearly this is a little girl
wearing a bed sheet!

14:23.032 --> 14:24.363
I can't eat haunted food.

14:24.363 --> 14:26.035
My nutritionist would kill me.

14:26.035 --> 14:29.158
Are you kidding me?
She doesn't even have eyeholes!

14:29.158 --> 14:32.041
All right, Cricket.
You wanna play like that, huh?

14:32.041 --> 14:35.875
Come, come. I'll take you
to the real pepper market!

14:35.875 --> 14:38.047
I'm not so sure
about this, Ma.

14:38.047 --> 14:39.338
Don't dawdle, Billy boy!

14:39.338 --> 14:41.841
I'm home, sweeties!

14:41.841 --> 14:45.004
Welcome to my piquant
pepper palace!

14:45.004 --> 14:46.806
Looks like we've
got a discount

14:46.806 --> 14:48.968
on the curly goblin
feet peppers!

14:48.968 --> 14:52.722
I think these wailing jalapenos
are calling out for you!

14:52.722 --> 14:56.225
Those are some of my
special super spicy boys!

14:56.225 --> 14:58.898
Go ahead and try one.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.019
Hmph. A tingle.

15:00.019 --> 15:02.111
Is that the best
you have to offer?

15:02.111 --> 15:03.653
You holdin' out on me, boy?

15:03.653 --> 15:05.655
Where are you hiding
the good stuff?

15:05.655 --> 15:09.028
[gasps] Finally,
a worthy palate.

15:09.028 --> 15:11.240
I have just the thing.

15:11.240 --> 15:14.454
Step right up!
We've got tomatoes for everyone.

15:14.454 --> 15:17.036
Folks, Wholesome Foods
has just partnered up

15:17.036 --> 15:22.131
with Japanese yuru-chara icon,
Tomato-san!

15:22.131 --> 15:23.963
Dance, Tomato-san, dance!

15:23.963 --> 15:25.304
Ooooh!

15:25.304 --> 15:28.217
Ladies and gentlemen, wait!
If you don't buy
our tomatoes,

15:28.217 --> 15:32.391
my poor sister won't be able
to afford her accordion lessons!

15:32.391 --> 15:35.645
How will I ever learn
to polka?

15:35.645 --> 15:36.936
Aww.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.107
Tomato-san,
you're fired!

15:38.107 --> 15:40.149
All right, kid,
that's enough.

15:40.149 --> 15:41.190
Let's talk this through!

15:41.190 --> 15:42.271
What's there to talk about

15:42.271 --> 15:43.943
besides getting you
out of this farmers' market?!

15:43.943 --> 15:46.065
-You greasy snake.
-Rat boy!

15:46.065 --> 15:48.067
-Two-faced goblin!
-Barefoot...

15:48.067 --> 15:49.949
Overalls... kid?

15:49.949 --> 15:52.872
Shallow jerk face, cool-guy
wannabe, no-good swindler!!

15:52.872 --> 15:54.744
Oooooh!

15:54.744 --> 15:58.247
-Uh, uh, umm... That's it.
-What ya doin', Chip?

15:58.247 --> 15:59.078
Calling your mama?

15:59.078 --> 16:02.792
I'm calling in Protocol C!

16:02.792 --> 16:06.175
And the "C" stands...
for coupons.

16:08.047 --> 16:10.009
Huh?

16:10.009 --> 16:11.090
Coupons?!

16:11.090 --> 16:12.181
Coupons!

16:12.181 --> 16:13.262
Coupons!

16:13.262 --> 16:15.054
[All] Coupons!!!

16:15.054 --> 16:18.147
[chuckling] I think I'll set up
another booth...

16:18.147 --> 16:20.099
and another!

16:20.099 --> 16:22.652
I won't stop until this whole
farmers' market

16:22.652 --> 16:24.734
is Wholesome Foods!

16:24.734 --> 16:28.738
If you want a war, Chip,
then you've got one!

16:28.738 --> 16:32.872
So you want to try my most
powerful pepper, do you?

16:32.872 --> 16:36.996
Just say the magic words:
Schmibitty beeeee!

16:36.996 --> 16:39.248
Hotter than
seven thousand suns...

16:39.248 --> 16:42.962
Behold!
The sultan pepper!

16:42.962 --> 16:46.756
Even looking at it is enough to
make a lesser man's eyes water!

16:46.756 --> 16:48.548
[panting]
He's right!

16:48.548 --> 16:52.301
It truly is
the spiciest pepper!

16:52.301 --> 16:55.595
NYA HA HA HA HA HA-- Huh?

16:55.595 --> 16:57.136
Oh, No!

16:57.136 --> 16:59.308
No one's ever eaten
the whole thing!

16:59.308 --> 17:01.270
Someone call a mouth doctor!

17:01.270 --> 17:04.233
Aw geez, I'm going
to have to move cities again.

17:04.233 --> 17:06.275
Huh?

17:06.275 --> 17:07.276
Zesty.

17:07.276 --> 17:08.778
My word...

17:08.778 --> 17:10.820
You are more than
a follower of the heat.

17:10.820 --> 17:12.992
You are the heat incarnate!

17:12.992 --> 17:15.364
Here! Take my whole supply
of sultan peppers.

17:15.364 --> 17:17.156
I bestow them unto you.

17:17.156 --> 17:19.418
Heck yeah!

17:19.418 --> 17:22.041
Cricket, are we on
the same page here?

17:22.041 --> 17:24.213
Is this still about
protecting papa's booth?

17:24.213 --> 17:26.756
Of course. The best defense,
is a good offense.

17:26.756 --> 17:29.218
Don't worry, Tilly,
we'll get 'em.

17:29.218 --> 17:31.220
Farmers of the market.

17:31.220 --> 17:34.634
Wholesome Foods is trying
to take us little guys down.

17:34.634 --> 17:36.225
But this is our turf!

17:36.225 --> 17:38.097
That small boy's
gotta point!

17:38.097 --> 17:41.310
-We should do something!
-Something drastic!

17:41.310 --> 17:44.353
-Money, please.
-Here comes my cash!

17:44.353 --> 17:45.484
Wholesome Foods
is the armpit

17:45.484 --> 17:47.446
and we are the deodorant!

17:47.446 --> 17:50.189
-Rally the troops.
-Yes, sir.

17:50.189 --> 17:53.402
His army is mobilizing
as we speak.

17:53.402 --> 17:55.244
Now is the time...

17:55.244 --> 17:57.366
To rise!

17:57.366 --> 18:00.289
If you think you scare me,
kid...

18:00.289 --> 18:02.291
then you've got
another thing coming!

18:02.291 --> 18:05.124
Oh, this is not going
to end well.

18:05.124 --> 18:09.128
-[bell tolls]
-[screaming]

18:10.760 --> 18:12.421
[both]
Grrrr... Get him!

18:12.421 --> 18:14.674
[war cries]

18:18.137 --> 18:19.268
Ow!

18:19.268 --> 18:20.389
Aaaaahh!

18:27.566 --> 18:29.278
-Ha!
-Grrr.

18:29.278 --> 18:31.360
-Huh?!
-Aaugh!

18:31.360 --> 18:33.232
Ha!
Didn't hit me doesn't count!

18:33.232 --> 18:34.573
That so counts!!

18:35.574 --> 18:38.447
You were meant
for better things.

18:38.447 --> 18:41.500
[screaming]

18:41.500 --> 18:43.202
I am the tomato-nator.

18:43.202 --> 18:44.704
The red destroyer.

18:44.704 --> 18:46.956
And I.
Will. Not. Stop!

18:46.956 --> 18:49.629
Cricket, stop.
What are you doing?

18:49.629 --> 18:51.881
You've become caught
in a petty cycle

18:51.881 --> 18:53.382
of revenge and
one-ups-man-ship!

18:53.382 --> 18:55.094
You're right...

18:55.094 --> 18:57.216
and I need to break out of it
by defeating Chip!

18:57.216 --> 18:58.718
No! That's not it!

18:58.718 --> 19:02.351
You can only break the cycle
by deciding enough is enough.

19:02.351 --> 19:04.523
But Tilly, we have to save
the farmer's market.

19:04.523 --> 19:06.105
The little guys
depend on it!

19:06.105 --> 19:07.396
Cricket, look!

19:07.396 --> 19:09.649
This pointless fighting
isn't saving the market.

19:09.649 --> 19:11.360
It's destroying it!

19:11.360 --> 19:12.361
Ughhhhh.

19:12.361 --> 19:13.482
Ohhhh.

19:13.482 --> 19:16.656
I can't afford...
dry cleaning.

19:16.656 --> 19:17.657
Eh.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.368
[gasps] Our booth.

19:21.951 --> 19:24.243
Tilly, you're right.
I've gone too far.

19:24.243 --> 19:25.244
Where are you going?

19:25.244 --> 19:26.545
I'm going to make this right.

19:26.545 --> 19:28.457
Get me more tomatoes!

19:28.457 --> 19:30.209
[Cricket] Chip Whistler!

19:30.209 --> 19:32.551
Chip, I don't like you
and you don't like me.

19:32.551 --> 19:34.383
But this fighting
can't go on.

19:34.383 --> 19:35.675
[gasps]

19:35.675 --> 19:37.346
We need to set aside
our pride

19:37.346 --> 19:40.139
before both our businesses
are destroyed.

19:40.139 --> 19:41.180
Will you join me?

19:41.180 --> 19:42.471
Really?

19:42.471 --> 19:45.354
No tricks, no tomatoes
behind your back?

19:45.354 --> 19:47.807
No, sir,
only my honest hand.

19:47.807 --> 19:49.268
[deep voice]
Good.

19:49.268 --> 19:50.860
Huh?
Aaaaugh!!!

19:50.860 --> 19:53.312
Ha-ha, sucker!
Chip doesn't settle!

19:53.312 --> 19:55.654
[grunting]

19:57.697 --> 20:00.369
What what!!
That's right, baby!

20:00.369 --> 20:02.371
Chip! Chip!
Chip! Chip!

20:02.371 --> 20:04.163
Come on, everybody,
why aren't you chanting?

20:04.163 --> 20:07.416
You just decimated
an unarmed child!

20:07.416 --> 20:10.379
Brother.
You were so young!

20:10.379 --> 20:11.500
Wow, what a jerk.

20:11.500 --> 20:14.383
No way we're shopping
at Wholesome Foods anymore!

20:14.383 --> 20:16.716
Yeah, we quit!
Come on, fellas.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.297
Wait!
Where are you all going?

20:18.297 --> 20:19.388
I won!

20:19.388 --> 20:22.301
[groaning]
Tilly...

20:22.301 --> 20:24.183
did I...
do a good?

20:24.183 --> 20:26.395
Yup, you did
a real good, brother.

20:26.395 --> 20:28.107
What in the world?

20:28.107 --> 20:29.979
Did you kids start a war
without your Gramma?

20:29.979 --> 20:31.060
Sorry, Gramma.

20:31.060 --> 20:32.521
Hey there!

20:32.521 --> 20:34.443
I got hit in the mouth
with one of your tomatoes,

20:34.443 --> 20:36.235
and they were delicious!

20:36.235 --> 20:37.526
Do you have any left?

20:37.526 --> 20:38.407
Well, sure!

20:38.407 --> 20:39.568
But what the heck
happened to you?

20:39.568 --> 20:40.910
[Chip] Chip happened!

20:40.910 --> 20:42.031
Chip?

20:42.031 --> 20:46.205
Chip, your worst nightmare,
Whistler!

20:46.205 --> 20:50.209
[chuckles] Smart trick, kid,
turning everyone against me!

20:50.209 --> 20:53.002
But Chip sees
right through you!

20:53.002 --> 20:54.503
And I've still got
some tricks of my own!

20:54.503 --> 20:56.375
[maniacal chuckle]

20:56.375 --> 21:00.429
Good luck selling food
with bites taken out of them!

21:00.429 --> 21:01.590
Hey!

21:01.590 --> 21:03.382
You better leave before
I decide to get nasty!

21:03.382 --> 21:04.513
What?

21:04.513 --> 21:07.186
Oh, you thought you could
hide some from me?!

21:07.186 --> 21:09.518
No wait, stop--
Oh what the heck.

21:09.518 --> 21:12.151
Hahahaha!
Mmmm.

21:12.151 --> 21:13.602
Oh. No.

21:13.602 --> 21:15.104
Hot. Hot.

21:15.104 --> 21:16.896
Yyaaahhhhhh!

21:18.567 --> 21:20.239
My tooth!
My tooth!

21:20.239 --> 21:22.862
I guess that means he'll
have to revenge us again.

21:22.862 --> 21:24.493
Don't worry,
we'll be ready.

21:24.493 --> 21:26.405
The Greens never forget.

21:26.405 --> 21:29.789
Oh, that Chip Whistler.
