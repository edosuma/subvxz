I'm your new foreman.

01:05.003 --> 01:06.946
Why should I believe you?

01:07.071 --> 01:08.915
Well, I guess Mr. Durant
didn't have time

01:09.040 --> 01:10.850
to come out and tell you his self.

01:10.975 --> 01:12.319
Durant?

01:12.444 --> 01:13.720
Yeah, he told me to come
look for Harper.

01:13.845 --> 01:15.221
Why?

01:15.346 --> 01:17.723
That's his business.

I have never seen nothin' like
it in all me life, boys.

07:01.338 --> 07:05.683
She used her organ like a velvet
hand on me tally whacker.

07:05.943 --> 07:07.852
[Chuckles]
And to hear her tell it,

07:07.977 --> 07:10.221
she's practiced these
dark arts of love

07:10.346 --> 07:12.022
on all manner of beasts and men.

07:12.281 --> 07:15.526

07:21.357 --> 07:23.909
in all the world with whom
she refuses to copulate.

07:24.125 --> 07:25.425

08:28.553 --> 08:31.997

just up and leave yesterday.

08:32.121 --> 08:33.645

08:33.811 --> 08:36.732
He rode out to rendez-vous
with the tree cutting party.

08:36.898 --> 08:41.779
He informed me yesterday
at our morning briefing.

08:41.945 --> 08:44.008
There's something about this man.

08:44.133 --> 08:45.991
He's up to something.

08:46.157 --> 08:48.413
He crossed paths with Mrs. Bell.

08:48.538 --> 08:49.648
Bohannon?

08:49.773 --> 08:51.038
He brought her in.

08:51.204 --> 08:52.247
Did she have the maps?

08:52.475 --> 08:53.551
Shh.

08:53.676 --> 08:55.250
She's right next door.

08:57.846 --> 09:01.425
[Sighs]
No, she didn't have them.

09:01.550 --> 09:05.135
How will you reach the
Pacific without them?

09:05.301 --> 09:06.637
You let me worry about that.

09:08.390 --> 09:12.726
Oh, there's a supply train
arriving tomorrow morning

09:12.892 --> 09:15.437

10:07.245 --> 10:10.824
Personal Chef from Delmonico's
in New York City.

10:10.949 --> 10:15.761
I wondered if you would like to
join me for dinner this evening?

10:15.886 --> 10:18.522
Yes, that would be wonderful.

10:23.961 --> 10:26.467
Is there anything else
I can get for you?

10:30.167 --> 10:35.047
Actually, has the reward
been given to anyone?

10:35.172 --> 10:37.978
Uh, I believe it
belongs to Mr. Bohannon.

10:38.144 --> 10:39.851
I don't think he's claimed it.

10:39.976 --> 10:41.440
Would you like me
to see that he gets it?

10:41.606 --> 10:43.355
No.

10:43.480 --> 10:46.361
There's someone else who deserves it.

own crib, right, ladies?

11:23.940 --> 11:25.859
[Laughter]

11:26.025 --> 11:27.069
Leave her alone.

11:27.235 --> 11:28.464
What do you say, blondie?

11:28.589 --> 11:30.499
Them Injuns teach you anything?

11:30.624 --> 11:32.501
[Hollering]
Leave her alone!

11:32.626 --> 11:34.535
Hey, I'm sorry, ma'am.

11:34.701 --> 11:37.454
These dirty whores don't know
a lady when they see one.

11:41.916 --> 11:45.012
Where there is hatred,
let me show love.

11:45.137 --> 11:48.316
Where there is injury, pardon.

11:48.441 --> 11:51.260
Where there is doubt, faith.

11:51.426 --> 11:53.186
Amen.

12:01.553 --> 12:03.897
You look like you're
feeling much better.

12:04.063 --> 12:06.441
It's amazing what
a little soap and water can do.

12:07.991 --> 12:09.987
I didn't mean to leave that night.

12:10.153 --> 12:11.437
But that man...

12:11.562 --> 12:13.323
There's no need to explain.

12:14.565 --> 12:16.159
You've cut your hair.

12:16.325 --> 12:17.776
Yes, ma'am.

12:17.901 --> 12:18.996
Did you come to pray?

12:19.162 --> 12:22.614
No, um... I came to give you this.

12:22.739 --> 12:25.082
It's the reward money.
No, please, take it.

12:25.207 --> 12:26.628
I can't.

12:26.794 --> 12:29.061
There'll be no trouble,
nobody knows it was you.

12:29.380 --> 12:31.322
No, that's not it.

12:31.447 --> 12:33.844
I'm not a bounty hunter.

12:34.010 --> 12:35.726
It's my duty to help.

12:35.851 --> 12:38.962
Joseph, that money will
buy a lot of bibles.

12:39.087 --> 12:41.852
Mrs. Bell, Reverend Cole.

12:42.018 --> 12:43.924

Please.

12:48.858 --> 12:50.777
Thank you.

12:50.943 --> 12:52.821
So, this is the fair-haired
maiden of the West?

12:52.987 --> 12:54.573
I beg your pardon?

13:04.165 --> 13:07.122
"Robert Bell fought valiantly to save

Yes.

13:19.125 --> 13:23.101
My husband... saved my life.

the rest of it? Um...

Of course not.

13:35.571 --> 13:37.824
Well, Indians will die
as a result of this.

13:37.990 --> 13:39.687
The Indians attacked us.

13:39.812 --> 13:42.454
If they die, they will
be to blame, not me.

13:42.620 --> 13:43.622
Maybe you've heard of
the Sand Creek massacre?

13:43.788 --> 13:45.248
I didn't come here to speak of this.

13:45.414 --> 13:47.728
You know, the Cheyenne were
flying the American flag

13:47.853 --> 13:49.562
over their camp and it
didn't stop the U.S. Calvary

13:49.687 --> 13:52.255
from killing 100 innocent
women and children.

13:52.421 --> 13:53.366
That was a terrible
thing that happened.

I wasn't a part of it.

13:55.007 --> 13:56.203

13:56.328 --> 13:57.552
try to see the bigger picture.

My husband was slaughtered
right in front of me.

That son of a bitch
got away because of you.

14:45.607 --> 14:47.216
Because of me?
How you figure that?

14:47.341 --> 14:50.063
You killed Johnson before
he could give me Harper's name.

14:52.148 --> 14:53.355
Oh.

14:53.480 --> 14:56.987
Well, I... I killed Johnson
before he killed you.

14:57.153 --> 14:58.594
Now...

14:58.719 --> 15:00.365
But I would have got
a name out of him.

15:00.531 --> 15:01.908
He would have blowed your brains out.

15:02.074 --> 15:03.165
And then I could have killed Harper

15:03.290 --> 15:04.703
before he had a chance to run.

15:04.869 --> 15:07.260
You're either drunk or crazy or both.

15:34.815 --> 15:40.228

of the mighty Shannon

15:40.353 --> 15:44.951
and the blarney stone...
The bloody Irish bog.

15:45.117 --> 15:47.701
Well, then we need new slides.

squirreled away, brother,

15:51.666 --> 15:52.667
now's the time to tell me.

15:52.833 --> 15:54.586
Maybe we should relocate.

15:54.752 --> 15:57.130
The rent is low down by
the slaughterhouse, right?

15:57.296 --> 15:58.378
The rent was low
in Wicklow, too, Mick.

16:00.883 --> 16:02.605
We're done with that shit.

It was a high rent dream
that brought us out here.

16:06.347 --> 16:10.435
I'm not going to let that big
Swedish bastard kill our dream.

16:10.601 --> 16:12.224
Am I right?

Mick?

16:14.939 --> 16:17.067
Hold on now.

16:17.233 --> 16:19.653
I just had a grand idea.

16:19.819 --> 16:21.571
Oh, no.

16:21.737 --> 16:23.324
It's a business idea.

16:24.794 --> 16:27.104
Ideas ain't your strong suit, Mick.

16:27.229 --> 16:28.620
Ah, ha ha.

16:28.786 --> 16:29.940
This one's golden.

16:30.065 --> 16:31.540
I'll prove it to ya.

16:33.541 --> 16:37.921
I've taken the liberty of
telegraphing your family in England.

16:38.087 --> 16:40.850
I just wanted them
to know you were well.

16:40.975 --> 16:42.753
Thank you, Mr. Durant.

16:42.878 --> 16:46.012
I'm afraid you'll grow
weary of my gratitude.

16:46.178 --> 16:49.683
I don't know what news of
the attack may have reached them.

16:49.849 --> 16:53.854
I didn't want your father
worrying needlessly.

16:54.020 --> 16:56.265
I'm sure my father was happy to hear

16:56.390 --> 16:59.067
he was right...

16:59.233 --> 17:00.861
About me coming to America.

17:01.027 --> 17:02.696
He was against it, no doubt?

17:02.862 --> 17:06.207
My father had every aspect
of my life planned out,

17:06.332 --> 17:07.951
including whom I should marry.

17:09.952 --> 17:12.237
Robert interrupted those plans.

17:16.275 --> 17:18.086
I saw him give a lecture

17:18.252 --> 17:21.381
at the British Museum
of Natural History.

17:21.547 --> 17:24.682
He spoke of the American West.

17:29.922 --> 17:32.966
I fell in love...

17:33.091 --> 17:36.646
With him and with this land.

17:36.812 --> 17:40.606
I, too, came under Robert's spell.

17:40.731 --> 17:45.545
His dream of a transcontinental
railroad became my own.

17:45.670 --> 17:49.806
Then it's a shame you two had
such a terrible falling out.

17:50.076 --> 17:54.080
Well, Robert and I didn't
see eye to eye on everything.

17:54.246 --> 17:58.418
Such as how to squeeze every
last dollar out of the railroad.

18:01.117 --> 18:06.217
Mrs. Bell, your husband
was a starry-eyed dreamer.

18:06.383 --> 18:08.595
I am a realist.

18:08.761 --> 18:11.635
Without me, his dream would
have remained just that.

18:11.760 --> 18:14.225
Thank you for your hospitality,
Mr. Durant.

18:15.698 --> 18:17.532
Mrs. Bell, please, I'm sorry.

18:17.812 --> 18:20.273
I didn't mean to impugn Robert.

18:20.439 --> 18:23.946
Yes, he needed me,
but I needed him also.

18:24.071 --> 18:27.989
Our marriage wasn't
perfect, but it worked.

18:30.157 --> 18:33.222
Mrs. Bell, there's nowhere
for you to go out there.

18:33.347 --> 18:36.665
Please... accept my apology.

18:38.152 --> 18:41.153
Do me the honor
of remaining my guest.

18:58.769 --> 19:00.839
[Indistinct chatter]

19:29.399 --> 19:30.844
Why you following me?

19:31.010 --> 19:32.512
You tryin' to get me killed?

19:32.678 --> 19:34.480
Mister, you do that all by yourself

19:34.605 --> 19:36.516
bustin' in on a white cathouse.

19:36.682 --> 19:37.809
What you want then?

19:37.975 --> 19:39.341
Huh?

19:40.644 --> 19:42.355
You still want to give me a roll?

19:44.146 --> 19:46.776
I thought you were mighty clear
on where you stood on that.

19:46.942 --> 19:50.728
Honey, I'm already a cut rate whore
on account of my beauty marks.

19:50.853 --> 19:55.869
My white customers know I laid
with a colored fella, I starve.

19:56.035 --> 20:01.305
But... if you got a dollar,

20:01.430 --> 20:05.336
then... maybe we can do
one off the books.

20:05.502 --> 20:08.715
Now you tryin' to get us both killed.

20:08.881 --> 20:10.605
[Chatter]

20:32.821 --> 20:35.037
[Bolan laughs]

20:35.162 --> 20:36.367
Look at him.

20:47.274 --> 20:49.917
Drop your hanky...

20:50.042 --> 20:52.050
Madam?

20:56.048 --> 20:57.449
Ah!

21:05.923 --> 21:09.136
Now, now, boys.

21:09.261 --> 21:12.605
I doubt Mr. Durant

21:12.730 --> 21:15.808
wants his new foreman assassinated.

21:15.933 --> 21:17.844
He shot my dang ear off, Swede.

21:17.969 --> 21:19.836
Too bad it was not your tongue.

21:21.505 --> 21:23.072
Move aside.

21:23.497 --> 21:28.954
Mr. Bolan, you need
to leave here right now.

21:30.690 --> 21:32.114
Damn it.

21:34.084 --> 21:38.196
Come on, Tommy, let's go.

21:38.321 --> 21:39.931
[Laughing]

21:40.056 --> 21:42.934
Let's go. Come on.

21:46.529 --> 21:49.207
Magnolias.

21:49.332 --> 21:52.944
They grow just outside
the gates of the Andersonville.

21:53.435 --> 21:59.507
Some nights, their perfume was almost
enough to mask the awful stench.

22:05.247 --> 22:09.092
Oh, you're a difficult man
to cipher, Mr. Bohannon.

22:09.217 --> 22:14.048
Let me buy you a drink.

22:14.214 --> 22:16.232
I won't turn down free liquor.

22:16.357 --> 22:17.866
Need another glass.

22:17.991 --> 22:19.168
Thank you.

22:19.293 --> 22:20.793
No.

22:24.731 --> 22:29.647
I know you killed Johnson.

22:31.371 --> 22:34.082
Hmm.

22:34.207 --> 22:38.781
What I do not know yet is why.

22:41.825 --> 22:44.091
Who are you?

22:44.216 --> 22:46.623
Hmm?

22:49.958 --> 22:52.957
Ah, I'll figure it out.

22:53.379 --> 22:54.923
You let me know when
you do, all right?

22:55.089 --> 22:57.842
[Laughing]

22:58.008 --> 23:02.108
Oh, by golly, you will be
the first to know, hmm?

23:02.233 --> 23:04.401
[Laughing]

23:06.871 --> 23:09.437
Oh, but in the meantime,

23:09.603 --> 23:13.650
I've got a business
proposition for you.

23:16.819 --> 23:21.493
Now, there is a... there
is some black powder coming in

23:21.618 --> 23:25.078
on the train...
Tomorrow morning.

23:25.244 --> 23:27.830
That is your cut.

23:27.996 --> 23:33.737
And you just look the other
way while my boys unload,

23:33.862 --> 23:38.007
uh, you know, a few barrels.

23:38.173 --> 23:43.481
Is that some of that... immoral
mathematics, Mr. Swede?

23:43.606 --> 23:44.472
Huh? Hmm.

23:45.072 --> 23:46.349
Hmm.

23:47.875 --> 23:51.020
All right...
You got a deal.

23:51.186 --> 23:52.578
Yeah.

23:54.356 --> 23:55.608
For another five.

24:05.993 --> 24:08.037
[Gasps]
Well, well, well.

24:08.203 --> 24:10.696
Lookee.

24:38.310 --> 24:40.703
{pub}How them Injuns treat you?

24:40.869 --> 24:44.224
Well... they were people.

24:44.349 --> 24:46.525
You know what people are like.

24:46.650 --> 24:51.397
Some of them are good and...
Some of them ain't so good.

24:51.522 --> 24:54.868
What about the ones that
put that mark on you?

24:54.993 --> 24:58.404
Well... this wasn't that bad.

24:58.529 --> 24:59.847
Did it hurt?

25:00.013 --> 25:04.000
Not as much as a lot of things.

25:14.177 --> 25:17.865
Folks be telling all kind of
tales 'bout what that mean.

25:18.031 --> 25:21.285
Well... what do you think it means?

25:23.619 --> 25:29.290
I reckon it mean you
was a slave... just like me.

25:31.359 --> 25:38.510
<i>Tuunuchch... hamokm...
Ahatch... asentk.</i>

25:40.262 --> 25:43.513
It's three blankets and a horse.

25:43.638 --> 25:46.540
That's what I was worth to 'em.

25:51.578 --> 25:55.714
Them eyes of yours alone
worth a hundred horses.

25:57.418 --> 25:58.697
They was fools.

25:58.863 --> 26:02.464
Maybe there's another
way of looking at it.

26:02.589 --> 26:07.501
Maybe this mark was their way
of giving me their name,

26:07.626 --> 26:11.872
telling the world
that I was one of them.

26:11.997 --> 26:13.975
Hmm.

26:14.100 --> 26:16.901
I got my master's name, too,

26:18.258 --> 26:20.428
but I sure as hell ain't one of them.

26:22.474 --> 26:30.437
Best I can tell... you ain't
one of nobody or nothin'.

26:31.983 --> 26:33.733
Just like you.

26:33.952 --> 26:35.985
[Chuckles]
Hmm?

26:42.759 --> 26:46.162
Nothin' like two peas in a pod, huh?

26:50.665 --> 26:52.293
40 miles.

26:52.459 --> 26:53.578
40 miles.

26:53.703 --> 26:54.779
Who came up with that number?

26:54.904 --> 26:57.582
It's completely arbitrary.

26:57.707 --> 26:59.184
[Sighs]

26:59.309 --> 27:01.252
I don't have enough
to worry about with savages

27:01.377 --> 27:03.971
and the cutthroats
I have working for me.

27:04.137 --> 27:06.599
It must be hard to be you.

27:13.455 --> 27:16.733
Those milksops in Washington,

27:16.858 --> 27:20.804
I begged them for more troops,
but get none.

27:20.929 --> 27:23.906
And my investors, do you
think they'll give me

27:24.031 --> 27:25.541
even a penny for new surveyors?

27:25.666 --> 27:26.702
Hmm.

27:26.967 --> 27:28.368
Hmm.

27:36.878 --> 27:40.212
They haven't got your guts, Thomas.

27:43.250 --> 27:47.723
Robert was a lucky man
to have you at his side.

27:49.589 --> 27:53.854
Thomas... are the new surveyors
to finish Robert's work?

27:54.093 --> 27:55.731
Yes, this time.

27:55.994 --> 27:57.938
Forgive me.

27:58.063 --> 28:01.142
I thought the lion's share of
Robert's work was finished.

28:01.267 --> 28:05.046
Yes, it was, but he still
owed me some surveys.

28:05.171 --> 28:08.953
I think he was keeping them from
me because of our falling out.

28:09.119 --> 28:10.542
I see.

28:11.909 --> 28:14.083
What kind of surveys?

28:15.913 --> 28:18.248
There.

28:19.546 --> 28:21.894
The Rocky Mountains?

28:22.019 --> 28:26.887
It's a 14,000-foot barrier
of stone and snow...

28:27.053 --> 28:33.143
But I think Robert
knew the way through.

28:33.309 --> 28:39.178
But when you didn't
have his maps, I...

28:39.303 --> 28:42.514
Oh, you poor man.

28:42.639 --> 28:45.155
You must have been crushed.

28:46.942 --> 28:49.019
I was.

28:49.144 --> 28:55.040
That's not to say I wasn't
elated to see you safe and sound.

28:58.688 --> 29:00.363
Let's have a song, shall we?

29:00.488 --> 29:01.630
Henri?

29:02.385 --> 29:05.887
<i>Chante quelque chose pour la danse,
s'il vous plaÃ®t.</i>

29:14.361 --> 29:17.202
<i>Ã la Claire fontaine,</i>

29:17.327 --> 29:20.533

<i>Il y a longtemps que je t'aime,</i>

29:31.511 --> 29:36.409

29:37.151 --> 29:43.521
<i>Sous les feuilles d'un chÃªne,
je me suis fait sécher.</i>

29:45.144 --> 29:51.226
<i>Sur la plus haute branche,

30:10.348 --> 30:16.880
<i>Tu as le coeur a rire,

30:18.134 --> 30:26.422
<i>Il y a longtemps que je t'aime

30:26.547 --> 30:33.169
<i>J'ai perdu mon ami
sans l'avoir mérité,</i>

30:34.824 --> 30:41.708
<i>pour un bouquet de roses,
que je lui refusais.</i>

30:44.440 --> 30:51.280
<i>Chante, rossignol, chante,
toi qui as le coeur gai,</i>

30:51.721 --> 30:57.917
<i>tu as le coeur a rire,

31:00.426 --> 31:04.188
<i>Il y a longtemps que je t'aime,</i>

31:04.833 --> 31:11.692
<i>jamais je ne t'oublierai.</i>

31:13.683 --> 31:16.745
<i>Il y a longtemps que je t'aime,</i>

31:16.870 --> 31:24.565
<i>jamais je ne t'oublierai.</i>

31:49.713 --> 31:52.825
Dark night here in hell,
brothers and sisters.

31:52.950 --> 31:54.593
Come on in.

31:54.718 --> 31:59.999
I got eggs, I got coffee,
I got scripture.

32:00.124 --> 32:02.601
Oh, Mr. Bohannon.

32:03.769 --> 32:05.146
Hi, Mr. Bohannon.

32:05.312 --> 32:07.705
Did the good Lord
save you from hanging

32:07.830 --> 32:09.985
so you could drown
yourself in whiskey?

32:10.151 --> 32:13.378
It's a little late for proselytizing,
ain't it, preacher?

32:13.503 --> 32:15.046
You know, you were right.

32:15.171 --> 32:16.447
You know,
you don't deserve forgiveness.

32:16.572 --> 32:17.816
Oh, yeah.

32:17.941 --> 32:19.150
Neither did I.

32:19.275 --> 32:21.051
You know, I stand here,

32:21.176 --> 32:24.488
my wickedness washed away by
the... by the blood of the lamb.

32:24.613 --> 32:27.377
What the hell do you
know about wickedness?

32:27.543 --> 32:29.838
You ever hear of bleeding Kansas?

32:39.160 --> 32:42.434
You know, I rode with
the martyr John Brown.

32:42.600 --> 32:44.436
John Brown was a cold blooded killer.

32:44.602 --> 32:47.439
You in a position to throw stones
on that account, Mr. Bohannon?

32:50.132 --> 32:51.360
That's right.

32:51.638 --> 32:55.217
Because you know one night...

32:55.342 --> 32:58.086
You authored the deaths of 5 men.

32:58.211 --> 33:00.035
Slave owners.

33:00.201 --> 33:03.247
We pulled them from their homes

33:03.413 --> 33:05.517
and butchered them with broadswords.

33:08.354 --> 33:10.397
You know, drunkard I was,

33:10.522 --> 33:14.501
I... I neglected to put
an edge on my blade.

33:14.626 --> 33:17.052
It was hard work, brother, but I...

33:17.218 --> 33:21.843
I kept a hacking and a hacking...

33:21.968 --> 33:24.044
And a hacking till
I couldn't hack no more.

33:24.169 --> 33:28.271
Now, that's bleedin' Kansas.

33:29.640 --> 33:32.484
Why didn't you just shoot 'em?

33:32.650 --> 33:35.388
Oh...

33:35.513 --> 33:38.991
The mercy of a bullet was
something they didn't deserve.

33:40.384 --> 33:42.027
Well, I owned slaves.

33:42.152 --> 33:45.247
Yeah, well, lucky for you, you
weren't in Kansas that night.

33:45.413 --> 33:46.822
Ahh.

33:48.225 --> 33:49.877
No, preacher.

33:52.670 --> 33:55.299
It's lucky for you.

33:57.008 --> 34:00.211
No one deserves forgiveness, brother.

34:00.336 --> 34:02.723
That's the beauty of grace.

34:04.840 --> 34:06.574
Yeah. Ah.

34:09.411 --> 34:14.491
Well, thank you
for the sermon, preacher.

34:14.616 --> 34:16.235
I used to be a lot like you, Cullen.

34:16.402 --> 34:20.157
The only difference
was I had a cause.

34:20.389 --> 34:22.284
What is yours?

34:24.958 --> 34:28.137
Yeah, John Brown's dead.

34:28.262 --> 34:30.230
Ha ha.
