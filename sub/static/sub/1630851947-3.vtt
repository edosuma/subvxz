00:09.460 --> 00:11.460
DSI caught up with Lizzie Adama
last night.

00:11.460 --> 00:14.460
She refused to come in, she ran.
She's scared.

00:14.460 --> 00:17.460
PC Adama.
I had my phone on in my pocket.

00:17.460 --> 00:20.460
I recorded everything
your friend said.

00:20.460 --> 00:23.660
"Little Miss Jihadi",
"Mohammad Bin Laden".

00:23.660 --> 00:25.460
You think I'm a racist?

00:25.460 --> 00:29.460
She wrote two statements about
the visit to Mehenni's house.

00:29.460 --> 00:30.460
I did it.

00:31.460 --> 00:32.980
It's done.

00:32.980 --> 00:34.500
Lizzie Adama's second statement.

00:34.500 --> 00:36.500
What made her write it?

00:37.820 --> 00:40.300
Stay away from her.

00:40.300 --> 00:43.460
They said that
the Mehenni complaint hurt the case.

00:43.460 --> 00:45.140
That Kovacs might get away with it.

00:45.140 --> 00:46.460
He's going down for life.

00:46.460 --> 00:49.460
The big policeman took her phone.

00:52.140 --> 00:55.460
I'm turning myself in.
No, wait, do not do that.

00:55.460 --> 00:57.660
We need a warrant for Shaw -
his homes, his vehicles, everything.

00:57.660 --> 01:01.460
You've got your warrant.
But you better find that phone.

01:20.460 --> 01:22.460
Go on. Go.

01:30.460 --> 01:32.660
You said you wanted to talk to me
before I hand myself in.

01:36.460 --> 01:38.660
That's Farah's.

01:38.660 --> 01:41.460
Hadley called me
on the way to the tower.

01:41.460 --> 01:42.500
Said it was in his locker.

01:42.500 --> 01:45.460
So she was telling the truth
about that, too.

01:46.980 --> 01:48.460
He took it from her.

01:48.460 --> 01:51.460
He did it to protect you.
To protect me?

01:51.460 --> 01:53.460
Here.
Are you kidding?

01:58.460 --> 02:00.460
'What are you doing
in my house?'

02:00.460 --> 02:02.460
'All right, calm down,
little Miss Jihadi.

02:02.460 --> 02:04.460
'Just looking for your dad,
that's all.'

02:04.460 --> 02:07.460
'Why? He hasn't done anything.'
'Yeah.'

02:07.460 --> 02:09.460
'Well, you tell him...
What's his name, Mohammed?

02:09.460 --> 02:12.460
'Mohammed, is it?
Mohammed Bin Laden.

02:12.460 --> 02:14.500
'You tell him we're looking for him.
All right?'

02:28.460 --> 02:30.460
He says "Bin Laden" on the tape.

02:31.460 --> 02:34.460
He told me he didn't.
He lied to my face.

02:34.460 --> 02:36.460
It's hardly a racist tirade, though,
is it?

02:36.460 --> 02:38.460
It's still racist.

02:38.460 --> 02:39.460
Enough to get him kicked out
of the police.

02:39.460 --> 02:41.140
Why, you think that's right?

02:41.140 --> 02:44.460
27 years of service
and Hadley's dismissed for what?

02:44.460 --> 02:47.460
For what, calling Farah's dad
Bin Laden? Really?

02:48.460 --> 02:50.460
Come on, you know he wasn't racist.

02:50.460 --> 02:52.460
He was from the street,
he talked like the street.

02:52.460 --> 02:54.460
He didn't mean anything.
It was a joke. It wasn't to Farah.

02:56.460 --> 02:58.460
Do you know what happened next?

02:58.460 --> 03:00.460
Her dad came home
and she was freaked out,

03:00.460 --> 03:03.460
because the big policeman
had just called her dad Bin Laden,

03:03.460 --> 03:06.460
so she shouted at him to run,
you know why?

03:07.460 --> 03:09.460
She'd been in this country
less than a year

03:09.460 --> 03:11.460
and she had no idea what
we were gonna do,

03:11.460 --> 03:13.460
were we going to shoot him
like Bin Laden?

03:14.460 --> 03:17.460
Hadley did that to her.

03:17.460 --> 03:18.460
My friend, Hadley.

03:21.460 --> 03:23.460
And worse is what I did.

03:24.460 --> 03:26.460
I covered for him.

03:26.460 --> 03:29.460
And I got that poor girl
to trust me,

03:29.460 --> 03:31.460
I knew what I was doing,
I was saying,

03:31.460 --> 03:34.460
"Look at me, trust me,
I'm like you."

03:34.460 --> 03:37.460
And then I took her trust and I...
I'm sorry...

03:37.460 --> 03:38.460
but the girl was mad.

03:38.460 --> 03:41.460
She wasn't. All she knew was that
the police threatened her,

03:41.460 --> 03:44.500
then lied about it
and then took her phone by force.

03:44.500 --> 03:46.820
And don't say Hadley did it
to protect me,

03:46.820 --> 03:48.460
he did it to protect himself.

03:48.460 --> 03:51.460
Well, I've had enough.

03:51.460 --> 03:56.300
I saw on TV how this is playing,
the crazy girl, t-the hero cop.

03:56.300 --> 04:00.460
I'm gonna tell the truth and...
I don't care what happens to me.

04:02.460 --> 04:04.460
Well, that's your call, Lizzie.

04:04.460 --> 04:06.460
But just so you're clear what
will happen to you,

04:06.460 --> 04:08.820
you're the one who committed
a crime here,

04:08.820 --> 04:10.660
you're the one who lied
in a statement,

04:10.660 --> 04:12.460
and you are the one
who will go to prison.

04:12.460 --> 04:14.460
You know what they do to cops
in prison?

04:14.460 --> 04:17.460
They put shit in your food.
Hadley knew that.

04:17.460 --> 04:20.500
He took that phone to protect you.
I'm sorry, but that girl was mad.

04:20.500 --> 04:25.460
She took a kid up a tower,
for God's sake. She killed Hadley.

04:25.460 --> 04:27.460
She didn't kill him.

04:33.460 --> 04:34.660
What happened up there?

04:36.460 --> 04:39.460
On the roof, what happened?
She didn't kill him.

04:56.460 --> 05:00.460
You saved a child. You did good.

05:02.460 --> 05:03.460
Real good.

05:05.460 --> 05:08.820
But you have to allow yourself
to survive. You have to.

05:10.460 --> 05:12.460
Please.

05:17.460 --> 05:21.460
You're doing it again.
What?

05:22.460 --> 05:25.140
Handling me.
Oh, come on.

05:27.460 --> 05:29.460
That first night
we slept together...

05:31.460 --> 05:33.460
..that was the night
Mehenni made his complaint.

05:36.140 --> 05:38.460
Was that why you did it?
To keep me on side?

05:38.460 --> 05:40.460
Is that what you think?

05:40.460 --> 05:43.460
I don't know what to think.
The Mehenni complaint was nothing.

05:43.460 --> 05:46.460
Every cop gets complaints.
It comes with the territory.

05:46.460 --> 05:47.460
And why did I sleep with you?

05:47.460 --> 05:49.460
Because I couldn't get you
out of my head, Lizzie.

05:51.460 --> 05:54.460
Because I'd just walk around Farlow
just hoping I'd see you. That's why.

05:56.460 --> 05:57.460
That's why I'm here right now,

05:57.460 --> 05:59.460
because I don't want you
to get in to trouble.

05:59.460 --> 06:01.460
I'm already in trouble.
No, you're not. No, you're not.

06:01.460 --> 06:04.460
Without the phone, DSI have nothing.
Nothing.

06:04.460 --> 06:08.460
So, please,
don't land yourself in it. Please.

06:11.460 --> 06:13.300
Or land you in it.

06:16.460 --> 06:17.460
I'm sorry, what?

06:20.500 --> 06:22.460
You're my inspector.

06:24.460 --> 06:27.460
Your actions don't look so great,
do they?

06:37.460 --> 06:39.460
I searched for this for you.

06:41.460 --> 06:44.460
I could go to jail for you.

06:51.460 --> 06:53.460
Mrs Shaw?

06:53.460 --> 06:56.460
I'm DS Sarah Collins.
Is your husband in?

06:56.460 --> 06:58.460
He's taken the dog for a walk.
What's going on?

06:58.460 --> 07:01.460
We have a search warrant for
the house.

07:01.460 --> 07:04.460
Well, you can't come in,
not till Kieran gets back.

07:04.460 --> 07:05.460
Have you called him?

07:05.460 --> 07:07.460
I've tried.
His phone's switched off.

07:07.460 --> 07:10.460
He said he'd buy me a milkshake.
Yeah, he'll be back soon.

07:10.460 --> 07:12.820
Like I said, wait till he gets back.

07:16.460 --> 07:18.460
You have to decide, Lizzie,
are you gonna let this ruin you,

07:18.460 --> 07:20.460
or are you going to
put it behind you

07:20.460 --> 07:21.460
and just learn to be a good cop?

07:21.460 --> 07:25.460
A good cop? What is that?

07:25.460 --> 07:27.460
Really? For all his faults,
Hadley was a good cop.

07:27.460 --> 07:29.460
I'm a good cop.

07:29.460 --> 07:32.460
And those bleeding hearts with
their politically-correct words,

07:32.460 --> 07:34.460
when the shit hits the fan
and their loved ones are in trouble,

07:34.460 --> 07:35.660
who do they want? Not you,

07:35.660 --> 07:37.460
not someone who's gonna doubt
and hesitate,

07:37.460 --> 07:39.980
and they certainly don't want
DS Collins either.

07:39.980 --> 07:41.980
They want someone with balls.
They want a Hadley.

07:41.980 --> 07:45.500
They want me.
What? A liar.

07:45.500 --> 07:50.460
A bully.
Why should I aspire to that?

07:50.460 --> 07:53.460
Like I said, Lizzie,
you do what you have to do.

07:53.460 --> 07:55.460
I'm gonna dispose of this
on the way home.

07:55.460 --> 07:57.660
When you're interviewed by DSI,
we never met.

07:57.660 --> 08:00.460
I cared for you, Lizzie.
I loved you.

08:03.460 --> 08:05.460
I still love you.

08:05.460 --> 08:07.460
But if you're gonna
sacrifice yourself,

08:07.460 --> 08:10.460
do not think for one moment
that you can drag me down with you,

08:10.460 --> 08:13.460
because you can't. You just can't.

08:31.140 --> 08:32.460
Shit.

08:54.820 --> 08:56.140
What are you doing here?

08:56.140 --> 08:58.140
We have a warrant to search
your house,

08:58.140 --> 09:00.460
your vehicles, and you, Sir.
My colleague, DC Bradshaw,

09:00.460 --> 09:02.660
is searching your London flat
and your office at Farlow.

09:02.660 --> 09:04.460
We waited for you
before starting here.

09:04.460 --> 09:06.460
That's very kind of you.

09:07.460 --> 09:10.980
You should've called, though.
I could have ordered for everyone.

09:10.980 --> 09:12.460
Your phone was switched off.

09:14.460 --> 09:18.460
What are you looking for, anyway?
I interviewed Younes Mehenni.

09:18.460 --> 09:21.460
He told me some disturbing things.
Really?!

09:21.460 --> 09:24.460
Did he tell you
why he started it all?

09:24.460 --> 09:27.300
Why he made his neighbour's
life hell, why he keyed her car,

09:27.300 --> 09:28.460
why he ran from the police,

09:28.460 --> 09:31.460
he ignored every attempt to defuse
the situation. Did he tell you that?

09:31.460 --> 09:35.820
And now you bring his unique brand
of bullshit to my home, really?!

09:35.820 --> 09:38.460
I apologise for disturbing
your family, Sir.

09:38.460 --> 09:40.660
It was unavoidable.
Unavoidable.

09:44.460 --> 09:48.460
Hey, sweetie. There you go.
Sorry about the circus.

09:48.460 --> 09:50.460
Are they allowed to do this?
They are.

09:50.460 --> 09:52.460
Detective Sergeant Collins,
my wife, Mary. My daughter, Anya.

09:52.460 --> 09:54.820
Will you need to search them, too?
No.

09:54.820 --> 09:57.300
We'll try to minimise
the disturbance, Mrs Shaw.

09:57.300 --> 10:00.460
Ah, sorry, I forgot to tell them
to leave room for milk.

10:00.460 --> 10:03.820
Buddy! Come on, boy!

10:12.460 --> 10:15.140
This is my colleague, DC Vine.
He'll be searching you.

10:15.140 --> 10:16.460
Is there somewhere private?

10:28.460 --> 10:31.500
Would you like me to undress?
That won't be necessary, Sir.

11:10.460 --> 11:13.460
Here she is.

11:15.460 --> 11:17.460
Hungry?
Yeah.

11:17.460 --> 11:18.460
OK.

12:06.460 --> 12:08.460
Didn't I tell you that Lizzie Adama

12:08.460 --> 12:11.460
was a target
in an organised crime case?

12:11.460 --> 12:14.460
Laszlo Kovacs, a wanted murderer?
Didn't I tell you that?

12:14.460 --> 12:15.980
If anything happens to her,
it's on you,

12:15.980 --> 12:17.820
you understand that, right?

12:17.820 --> 12:19.460
It's on her.

12:19.460 --> 12:22.460
She had every chance
to turn herself in, she refused.

12:24.460 --> 12:25.820
You are cold.

12:27.140 --> 12:28.500
You have special feelings
for Lizzie?

12:28.500 --> 12:31.460
Special feelings?
What is that, like, code?

12:31.460 --> 12:32.460
Do you?

12:34.460 --> 12:35.820
Well done.

12:37.460 --> 12:39.460
No, seriously, well done.

12:40.460 --> 12:43.460
I bet you that makes you feel like
a real detective, sniffing around,

12:43.460 --> 12:45.460
digging up gossip.
So it's true?

12:48.300 --> 12:50.460
You're having an affair?
It's none of your business.

12:52.460 --> 12:55.300
If it influenced her decisions,
it will be my business.

12:55.300 --> 12:59.460
You wanna know my feelings
for Lizzie? OK.

13:01.460 --> 13:03.460
I think she's amazing.

13:03.460 --> 13:05.460
I think she's
an amazing police officer.

13:05.460 --> 13:07.460
Will she still want to
be a police officer

13:07.460 --> 13:10.460
after you've finished with her.
I doubt it.

13:33.460 --> 13:35.460
What's your name?
Farah.

13:37.460 --> 13:38.460
Farah.

13:39.460 --> 13:42.460
'All right, calm down,
little Miss Jihadi.'

13:44.820 --> 13:47.460
Well, you tell him.
What's his name, Mohammed?

13:47.460 --> 13:49.460
Mohammed, is it?
Mohammed Bin Laden?

13:57.820 --> 13:59.460
We're done, sir.

14:01.460 --> 14:03.460
Did you find anything?
No.

14:05.460 --> 14:06.500
So you invaded my home,

14:06.500 --> 14:11.460
embarrassed me in front of my wife
and child for... nothing.

14:14.460 --> 14:15.460
Are you surprised?

14:15.460 --> 14:19.460
What surprises me is how untouchable
some people think they are.

14:50.460 --> 14:52.820
I didn't find the phone.
Me neither.

14:54.820 --> 14:57.460
He probably dumped it
as soon as he got it

14:57.460 --> 14:59.460
from Hadley Matthews' locker.
Yeah.

15:01.460 --> 15:05.460
So what next?
Hadley Matthews' postmortem.

15:05.460 --> 15:07.460
I asked them to hold off
till I got back.

15:11.980 --> 15:13.460
Steve Bradshaw.

15:13.460 --> 15:15.140
I...

15:16.660 --> 15:17.820
'Erm...'

15:19.460 --> 15:20.460
Lizzie?

15:23.460 --> 15:24.460
Is that you?

15:26.460 --> 15:28.460
'Hello?'

15:32.460 --> 15:34.140
'Lizzie?'

15:36.660 --> 15:40.460
She say anything?
Just hung up.

15:40.460 --> 15:43.460
I'll get a trace going.
Find her.

15:43.460 --> 15:44.980
Before she does something
really daft.

16:28.460 --> 16:30.460
I need to re-examine
the girl's body.

16:59.140 --> 17:01.460
See the scratches, the bruising?

17:03.460 --> 17:05.460
I thought they were probably
caused in the fall,

17:05.460 --> 17:08.460
or when her body was lifted at
the scene.

17:10.500 --> 17:15.460
But under his nails,
there are skin and flesh fragments.

17:15.460 --> 17:17.460
Obviously, we'll have to do DNA,
but...

18:01.460 --> 18:03.460
Lizzie.

18:08.460 --> 18:09.460
Don't do this.

18:20.500 --> 18:22.460
Lizzie.

18:24.460 --> 18:26.460
Why should you be the one who pays?

18:37.460 --> 18:40.460
- I got Lizzie.
- 'Oh, thank God. Where?'

18:40.460 --> 18:42.460
Portland Tower.
'That figures.'

18:42.460 --> 18:45.460
I think I know why she ran.
Book her in.

18:45.460 --> 18:47.460
She's to be held incommunicado.
No contact.

18:47.460 --> 18:49.460
Not family, not colleagues, no-one.

18:49.460 --> 18:50.820
OK.
'Great work, Steve.'

19:11.660 --> 19:13.460
I want to know what you're gonna do.

19:15.820 --> 19:18.460
Well, I had two options.

19:20.460 --> 19:24.460
The first, you took away.
The second is...

19:27.460 --> 19:31.460
..say what happened.
Just tell the truth.

19:34.460 --> 19:37.460
Which is the right thing to do.
I don't care if I go to jail.

19:42.460 --> 19:45.460
I've been police for 15 years.

19:46.460 --> 19:48.460
I've got friends, good friends,

19:48.460 --> 19:51.460
who haven't said a word to me
since the day I joined.

19:53.660 --> 19:57.460
I had crossed a line
they couldn't understand,

19:57.460 --> 19:58.460
or couldn't forgive.

20:00.460 --> 20:02.460
Bet you've had the same...

20:03.660 --> 20:05.460
..or similar.

20:08.460 --> 20:10.460
Don't you want that to end?

20:14.980 --> 20:16.460
You have a third option, Lizzie.

20:18.660 --> 20:20.460
It's the hardest one.

20:23.460 --> 20:24.980
You're gonna have to lie.

20:44.460 --> 20:45.460
Where've you been?

20:49.460 --> 20:51.660
Don't worry about the phone,
I did what you should've done.

20:51.660 --> 20:54.460
I've smashed it with a hammer,
I've thrown the pieces in the river.

20:54.460 --> 20:55.500
Darling.
Mm.

20:58.500 --> 21:01.660
Is that the end of it?
Nearly.

21:01.660 --> 21:03.820
Not quite.

21:03.820 --> 21:05.300
Because of her?

21:06.460 --> 21:07.820
Lizzie Adama?

21:29.460 --> 21:31.460
The top of the tower.
Mm.

21:32.460 --> 21:35.460
On the edge.
I thought she might jump. Christ.

21:35.460 --> 21:39.460
Did she say anything,
where she's been, who she's seen?

21:39.460 --> 21:43.460
No. Just said she wanted space.

21:43.460 --> 21:46.300
I hear you're the man
who caught our fugitive, Steve.

21:46.300 --> 21:47.460
Bloody well done.

21:47.460 --> 21:49.460
Thank you, Sir. I got lucky.

21:53.460 --> 21:54.460
Let's walk.

21:57.460 --> 22:00.460
You didn't find the girl's phone.
No, Sir.

22:00.460 --> 22:03.460
So threatening me with
a public scandal achieved what?

22:03.460 --> 22:05.460
It achieved nothing.

22:05.460 --> 22:07.460
Instead of searching
for phantom phones,

22:07.460 --> 22:09.460
why haven't you interviewed
Carrie Stoddard?

22:09.460 --> 22:11.460
Her son was on the roof.
He's a witness.

22:11.460 --> 22:14.460
Mrs Stoddard has consistently
refused to let us speak to Ben, Sir.

22:14.460 --> 22:16.660
She doesn't want him
reliving the trauma.

22:16.660 --> 22:20.460
So tell me, Sarah, what do you have,
after three days of investigation?

22:20.460 --> 22:24.300
And I don't mean speculation about
racist language and searched lockers

22:24.300 --> 22:26.460
and missing phones.
I mean actual, chargeable offences.

22:26.460 --> 22:29.460
I was at PC Matthews'
postmortem last night.

22:29.460 --> 22:33.460
Under his fingernails,
skin and flesh scrapings.

22:33.460 --> 22:37.460
On Farah's wrist, deep bruises,
gouges.

22:37.460 --> 22:39.460
You're saying he attacked her?

22:39.460 --> 22:42.460
I'm not saying it, the evidence is.

22:42.460 --> 22:44.460
She was gonna cost him his job,

22:44.460 --> 22:47.820
his pension after 27 years,
his reputation.

22:47.820 --> 22:49.460
Can you prove it?

22:49.460 --> 22:53.460
If the boy won't talk,
what've you got? Lizzie Adama.

22:53.460 --> 22:57.300
She saw it happen.
Will she turn on her dead partner?

22:57.300 --> 22:58.460
Do you have any leverage?

22:59.460 --> 23:02.460
It's why she ran
and kept on running.

23:02.460 --> 23:04.460
She saw him do it.

23:04.460 --> 23:05.460
That's leverage.

23:20.660 --> 23:22.460
Set up the interview room.

23:25.460 --> 23:27.660
You ready, Lizzie?

23:35.460 --> 23:39.500
Do you want a pee, cup of tea,
shot of vodka? No, thanks.

23:45.460 --> 23:46.460
This interview is taking place

23:46.460 --> 23:49.500
at Victoria House on 24th April
at 3:35 PM.

23:49.500 --> 23:54.460
Present are DC Steve Bradshaw.
DS Sarah Collins.

23:54.460 --> 23:55.460
PC Lizzie Adama.

23:56.980 --> 24:00.660
Lizzie, can I remind you that
you're still under caution? Yes.

24:00.660 --> 24:05.460
Thanks, can you confirm that you
have declined legal representation.

24:05.460 --> 24:08.460
I have. I confirm.

24:19.300 --> 24:20.980
Let's talk about the beginning.

24:20.980 --> 24:23.460
You went to Farah's home
to make arrest inquiries.

24:23.460 --> 24:26.460
A complaint resulted
against PC Matthews.

24:26.460 --> 24:28.460
Farah claimed Hadley said
racist things to her.

24:28.460 --> 24:30.460
Did he?
No.

24:32.460 --> 24:36.460
He had a way of saying things
that could be misunderstood.

24:36.460 --> 24:39.460
In your statement, you say,

24:39.460 --> 24:41.460
"I heard the whole conversation

24:41.460 --> 24:43.460
"between Farah Mehenni
and PC Matthews.

24:43.460 --> 24:46.460
"He never said anything of
a racist nature."

24:46.460 --> 24:48.460
If he never said anything
of a racist nature,

24:48.460 --> 24:50.460
how can he have been misunderstood?

24:51.460 --> 24:53.460
I don't know.
So what did he say?

24:53.460 --> 24:57.300
He said that we needed to
speak to her dad,

24:57.300 --> 24:58.460
that we'd keep coming back.

24:58.460 --> 25:00.300
So Farah lied?
No.

25:00.300 --> 25:01.460
Someone's lying here

25:01.460 --> 25:03.460
and if it wasn't you,
it has to be Farah.

25:05.140 --> 25:06.460
Is that a question?

25:08.460 --> 25:10.460
PC Matthews' statement
responding to the complaint.

25:10.460 --> 25:14.140
He denies it. He says you will
corroborate his account.

25:14.140 --> 25:15.460
Why did it take you so long?

25:16.460 --> 25:18.460
I'd already made a statement.

25:18.460 --> 25:21.460
About the arrest inquiries, yeah.
I have it here.

25:21.460 --> 25:25.460
It's precise, detailed.
Exemplary, in fact.

25:25.460 --> 25:29.460
But the second statement,
only ten lines and six days later.

25:29.460 --> 25:31.460
What took you so long?

25:32.460 --> 25:34.500
I just didn't get around to it.

25:36.460 --> 25:38.460
Top of your class
in training school,

25:38.460 --> 25:40.460
one commendation already,

25:40.460 --> 25:43.460
you're not the sort of officer
who "doesn't get round" to things.

25:43.460 --> 25:46.460
I was busy. We're always busy.

25:46.460 --> 25:49.460
"A mentor",
"Took you under his wing",

25:49.460 --> 25:52.460
that's what everyone said
about Hadley Matthews and you,

25:52.460 --> 25:54.460
but you took six days to write
a statement supporting him,

25:54.460 --> 25:56.460
why, because you were lazy? Selfish?

25:56.460 --> 25:57.980
No.
Then why?

25:59.660 --> 26:01.460
If the complaint had been upheld,

26:01.460 --> 26:03.660
PC Matthews would've been
dismissed from the service,

26:03.660 --> 26:06.460
he would've lost his pension.
So he pressured you, didn't he? No.

26:06.460 --> 26:09.460
Did DI Shaw pressure you?
What? No.

26:09.460 --> 26:12.460
Even though you were in
a relationship with him?

26:15.500 --> 26:17.500
You were in a relationship with him,
weren't you?

26:22.500 --> 26:24.460
Yes.

26:24.460 --> 26:27.500
I was in a relationship with him.

26:27.500 --> 26:30.460
No, he didn't pressure me.

26:30.460 --> 26:32.460
You find it hard to lie, don't you?

26:33.460 --> 26:36.460
I don't know what that means.
The reason you took so long to write

26:36.460 --> 26:38.460
the statement is that you couldn't
bring yourself to lie,

26:38.460 --> 26:40.500
but you also couldn't bring yourself
to tell the truth.

26:40.500 --> 26:43.460
You hadn't heard what Hadley said,
because you weren't there. I was.

26:43.460 --> 26:45.460
So when PC Matthews came to you
for support,

26:45.460 --> 26:47.460
you quite rightly refused.
No.

26:47.460 --> 26:49.820
But after six days of pressure,
you cracked.

26:49.820 --> 26:52.660
You wrote a ten-line statement
backing Hadley. You lied. No.

26:57.140 --> 26:59.460
I believe that, more than anyone,

26:59.460 --> 27:01.460
a police officer has to obey
the law.

27:01.460 --> 27:04.460
Not just some of the time,
or most of the time,

27:04.460 --> 27:07.460
or even 99% of the time,
all the time.

27:08.460 --> 27:09.660
Do you believe that?

27:11.460 --> 27:12.460
Yes.

27:15.140 --> 27:17.460
I interviewed Farah's
father yesterday.

27:17.460 --> 27:19.140
This is what he said.

27:19.140 --> 27:21.460
'PC Adama said
she heard everything that

27:21.460 --> 27:23.460
'the big policeman said,
but how could she?

27:23.460 --> 27:28.460
'She was in the back yard,
that's what my daughter said.

27:28.460 --> 27:31.460
'But it doesn't matter, does it?
Because my daughter had her phone

27:31.460 --> 27:35.460
'and she recorded everything,
she proved that they were lying.

27:35.460 --> 27:38.460
'PC Adama, she knew this. Why?'
Stop.

27:38.460 --> 27:40.460
'Because my daughter had called her

27:40.460 --> 27:43.460
'and told her that she
had everything on the phone.' Stop!

27:43.460 --> 27:47.820
'But she lied. To a girl who
trusted her, looked up to her.

27:47.820 --> 27:50.460
She said, "PC Adama is good."'
Please, stop.

27:50.460 --> 27:53.460
'"She will tell the truth."
But she didn't.' Sarah.

27:53.460 --> 27:56.460
'Just lies.'
Please, stop!

28:00.500 --> 28:02.460
She's close.

28:02.460 --> 28:04.460
One more push, yeah?

28:05.980 --> 28:07.460
Steve?

28:08.460 --> 28:09.460
Yeah, she's close.

28:11.460 --> 28:12.460
You're doing great, Sarah.

28:15.460 --> 28:16.460
I'm just going for a pee.

28:35.500 --> 28:37.820
Let's talk about the roof.

28:37.820 --> 28:40.300
You got there very quickly,
didn't you?

28:40.300 --> 28:45.460
I heard a call come in that
a five-year-old boy was missing.

28:45.460 --> 28:47.460
It had to be Ben.

28:47.460 --> 28:50.500
Because of the bear suit.
Yeah.

28:50.500 --> 28:55.460
Then, I heard there were people on
top of Portland Tower, I just knew.

28:55.460 --> 28:57.460
How did you know?

28:57.460 --> 29:01.460
Farah had called me the day before.
She was upset.

29:02.460 --> 29:05.460
She thought I'd promised
her father a caution.

29:05.460 --> 29:07.460
She said this to you on the phone?

29:07.460 --> 29:13.460
She said there was a place
she liked to go, Portland Tower.

29:13.460 --> 29:14.460
She wanted to meet there.

29:17.300 --> 29:19.460
She was scared
they were gonna lose their home.

29:19.460 --> 29:20.980
What else did she say?

29:22.460 --> 29:23.460
Nothing else.

29:24.500 --> 29:27.460
Aren't you missing something?

29:27.460 --> 29:30.460
Younes Mehenni said Farah recorded
what PC Matthews said...

29:30.460 --> 29:32.460
Younes saying it
doesn't mean she did.

29:32.460 --> 29:34.820
And if she did, where's the phone?

29:38.460 --> 29:39.460
We'll get to the phone.

29:41.460 --> 29:43.460
Did you tell PC Matthews
about Farah's call?

29:43.460 --> 29:46.300
About the place where
she wanted to meet? No.

29:46.300 --> 29:48.460
Then why did he go to the tower?

29:48.460 --> 29:50.300
How did he even know about
the tower?

29:50.300 --> 29:52.980
He heard the same radio calls I did,

29:52.980 --> 29:55.460
he must've come to
the same conclusion.

29:55.460 --> 29:58.460
He was driving to the tower
before it was mentioned on any call.

29:58.460 --> 30:00.460
How did he know?
I don't know.

30:03.460 --> 30:05.460
So you get to the tower,
you go to the roof

30:05.460 --> 30:06.460
and PC Matthews is already there.

30:09.460 --> 30:11.980
Farah?!

30:11.980 --> 30:14.460
Yes. And Farah and Ben.

30:14.460 --> 30:18.140
How would you describe Farah?
She's upset.

30:19.660 --> 30:22.460
She thinks the police
have let her down,

30:22.460 --> 30:24.460
I've let her down.

30:24.460 --> 30:27.140
I'm so sorry. I didn't know...

30:27.140 --> 30:30.460
You did!
You told him about the phone.

30:30.460 --> 30:32.460
You took it! You stole it!

30:32.460 --> 30:34.460
That's not the only reason
she's upset though, is it?

30:34.460 --> 30:37.460
She's angry because PC Matthews
has taken her phone.

30:37.460 --> 30:38.980
I don't know anything about that.

30:38.980 --> 30:41.460
PC Matthews took the phone
from Farah at Portland Tower,

30:41.460 --> 30:43.460
that special place
she told you about,

30:43.460 --> 30:45.460
the tower she walked past on
the way to school every day.

30:45.460 --> 30:47.460
I don't know anything about that.

30:55.460 --> 30:57.460
I learned things about Farah,

30:57.460 --> 31:01.300
how she had a clear sense
of justice, of fair play.

31:01.300 --> 31:03.460
Why do you think she took the boy?
Cos she was mad?

31:03.460 --> 31:04.460
No.
No.

31:04.460 --> 31:06.820
She took Ben because something
was taken from her,

31:06.820 --> 31:08.460
which proved she wasn't a liar.

31:08.460 --> 31:11.460
You didn't want to call her a liar
before, why are you doing it now?

31:12.460 --> 31:16.460
Lizzie, tell me why Farah was upset.
I told you, she was angry.

31:16.460 --> 31:18.460
I thought you weren't like him.

31:18.460 --> 31:20.460
He mocked me!

31:20.460 --> 31:22.660
She kidnapped a child, because
PC Matthews took her phone

31:22.660 --> 31:25.460
She didn't mention a phone.
Lizzie, how did Hadley Matthews

31:25.460 --> 31:27.460
know to go to the tower?
That's where he took the phone.

31:27.460 --> 31:29.980
Why did DI Shaw,
in the middle of a major incident,

31:29.980 --> 31:32.460
go and search Hadley's locker?
To find the phone.

31:32.460 --> 31:34.460
How else do you explain Farah
and Hadley's behaviour?

31:34.460 --> 31:37.140
I don't know,
I can't speak for them.

31:37.140 --> 31:39.460
Because they're dead!
I know they're dead.

31:39.460 --> 31:42.460
I was trying to save their lives!

31:42.460 --> 31:46.460
He shouldn't have done that.
I'm so ashamed.

31:46.460 --> 31:48.460
Please, Farah,
come back from the edge,

31:48.460 --> 31:52.460
we'll tell the truth.
You won't!

31:52.460 --> 31:54.140
I'll never trust you again!

31:54.140 --> 31:56.460
What happened up there, Lizzie?
How did they fall?

31:58.460 --> 32:00.460
I had to get Ben back from the edge.

32:00.460 --> 32:02.460
This is my fault.

32:03.660 --> 32:08.300
You want me, not Ben.
Please, Farah...

32:08.300 --> 32:10.460
he's innocent.

32:10.460 --> 32:14.460
I am innocent, too!
Yes.

32:16.460 --> 32:17.460
You are innocent, too.

32:27.460 --> 32:30.460
Tell them. Tell them I let you go.

32:30.460 --> 32:32.460
Come on, Ben. Come on.

32:35.980 --> 32:37.460
So you didn't see them fall.

32:38.460 --> 32:42.500
They were there...
Then, they weren't.

32:45.460 --> 32:47.460
Farah's father gave me this.

32:47.460 --> 32:51.140
Like a gesture of trust,
that I would find the truth.

32:53.460 --> 32:55.660
Are you telling the truth?

32:55.660 --> 32:59.460
I'm telling the truth.
So Farah's a liar, is that true?

32:59.460 --> 33:01.460
And Hadley Matthews was
the type of cop

33:01.460 --> 33:03.460
who gives the rest of us a bad name.

33:03.460 --> 33:05.460
It's why you say
you didn't see the end.

33:05.460 --> 33:07.460
Because, for Hadley,
there was only one end,

33:07.460 --> 33:10.460
only one way he gets his life back,
the girl goes off the tower.

33:10.460 --> 33:13.460
This is the forensic evidence
which proves he went for her

33:13.460 --> 33:16.460
once the boy was safe.
He went for her, he gouged her arm.

33:16.460 --> 33:19.460
But the ledge was too narrow
and he was too big and he fell.

33:19.460 --> 33:21.460
That's what happened at the end
and you did see it.

33:30.460 --> 33:34.460
You're right. I did see it.

33:34.460 --> 33:37.460
He killed her.
No. No.

33:39.460 --> 33:40.460
No.

33:42.460 --> 33:43.460
I did.

33:48.460 --> 33:50.460
She was so close.

33:54.300 --> 33:56.460
I tried...
I tried to grab her and...

34:06.460 --> 34:10.460
No. No!

34:19.460 --> 34:22.460
But she moved.

34:26.300 --> 34:29.460
And, erm...

34:29.460 --> 34:30.460
..and Hadley...

34:32.460 --> 34:36.460
Hadley who was safe,
he was safe...

34:46.980 --> 34:48.460
You don't know Hadley at all.

34:50.460 --> 34:52.460
He died trying to save her life.

34:54.300 --> 34:56.300
If you want to charge me
with anything,

34:56.300 --> 34:57.460
charge me with that.

34:59.460 --> 35:01.140
I killed her.

35:06.980 --> 35:10.300
Trying to save a life isn't
a chargeable offence.

35:10.300 --> 35:12.980
Interview suspended at 16:25.

35:28.460 --> 35:29.460
You're free to go.

35:30.460 --> 35:32.460
Our report will go to the CPS,

35:32.460 --> 35:34.460
they'll decide
if there's a case to prosecute.

35:35.460 --> 35:38.460
In the meantime, I'll walk you out.

35:55.460 --> 35:57.500
That's the end of it.
Do you understand me?

36:00.460 --> 36:03.460
Farah's dead. Hadley's dead.
I know.

36:04.460 --> 36:07.300
But they found each other
and neither would back down.

36:09.460 --> 36:12.460
The service is better
with you in it.

36:12.460 --> 36:14.980
That's why I stuck my neck out
for you, why I betrayed my friend.

36:18.460 --> 36:22.460
You've made your mistake.
Learn from it and move on.

36:25.460 --> 36:26.460
Be a good cop.

36:45.460 --> 36:49.500
Good night.
Good night, Steve.

36:49.500 --> 36:52.460
I'm off,
wondered if you'd like a...

36:52.460 --> 36:54.460
She called you at 8:35pm last night?

36:54.460 --> 36:56.460
About then, yeah.

36:56.460 --> 36:59.460
But you didn't book her into custody
until 10:20.

37:01.460 --> 37:03.460
Even allowing for getting
to the tower, getting her down...

37:05.460 --> 37:07.460
..that's a long time.

37:09.460 --> 37:12.140
What did you say to her?

37:12.140 --> 37:14.460
Where are you going with this,
Sarah?

37:14.460 --> 37:16.460
When we paused the interview... No.

37:17.460 --> 37:20.460
When YOU paused the interview,
she was about to break.

37:20.460 --> 37:22.460
Then, someone took her a cup of tea.

37:23.660 --> 37:25.460
When she came back,
she was different,

37:25.460 --> 37:27.460
her story was solid,
I couldn't shift it...

37:31.140 --> 37:32.460
I checked the cell log.

37:36.460 --> 37:38.460
Why did you take her a cup of tea,
Steve?

37:40.460 --> 37:42.460
So you could help her through
the difficult part?

37:42.460 --> 37:44.460
Don't be ridiculous.
Ridiculous?

37:44.460 --> 37:46.460
You were with her just now.
I saw you.

37:47.820 --> 37:52.460
The interview was everything we had.
And you showed her how to beat it.

37:58.980 --> 38:02.140
Even if I did what you say,
so what?

38:02.140 --> 38:05.460
Really? So what?

38:05.460 --> 38:06.500
She's a girl in her 20s.

38:06.500 --> 38:09.460
She's a police officer!
She perverted the course of justice!

38:09.460 --> 38:11.460
She made a stupid mistake,
she backed a colleague!

38:11.460 --> 38:13.460
If you want to punish someone,
punish Shaw.

38:13.460 --> 38:15.500
He's the one that should be in that
interview room, not Lizzie.

38:15.500 --> 38:18.460
I tried to get Shaw, you know I did,
he was too fucking slippery.

38:18.460 --> 38:21.460
So you take it out on her?
She would have given us Shaw!

38:21.460 --> 38:22.500
She'd have gone to jail.

38:24.460 --> 38:26.300
Is that what you joined to do,

38:26.300 --> 38:28.460
send an inexperienced cop to prison
for a mistake?

38:28.460 --> 38:30.460
If her inexperience is mitigation,

38:30.460 --> 38:32.300
it's for the court to decide,
not us.

38:32.300 --> 38:34.980
I said,
is that what you joined to do?

38:37.460 --> 38:40.460
Yeah, it is.

38:40.460 --> 38:44.140
To do my job, to apply the law.
Why, what did you join for?

38:44.140 --> 38:46.460
To put away bad guys, not...
A teenage girl is dead.

38:46.460 --> 38:47.460
And I'm sorry for Farah.

38:47.460 --> 38:49.460
But destroying Lizzie
won't bring her back.

38:51.500 --> 38:53.980
God.

38:53.980 --> 38:56.300
You're a good detective, Sarah...

38:57.460 --> 38:59.460
..but, man,
do you waste your talents.

39:01.460 --> 39:05.460
If you've got a complaint about me,
put it on paper.

39:33.300 --> 39:34.460
Hey.

39:35.460 --> 39:37.140
I've tried phoning.

39:38.460 --> 39:39.820
Dozens of times.

39:41.460 --> 39:43.460
I didn't want to talk to you.

39:45.460 --> 39:46.820
I heard you didn't give
DSI anything.

39:49.460 --> 39:51.460
I'm glad.

39:51.460 --> 39:53.460
I didn't do it for you,
if that's what you think.

39:55.460 --> 39:56.660
Not for Hadley either.

39:56.660 --> 39:58.460
I'm glad for you.

40:01.460 --> 40:03.500
You're here for a reason.
What is it?

40:03.500 --> 40:07.460
Artemis arrested Laszlo Kovacs
last night.

40:09.300 --> 40:10.460
They need an ID.

40:10.460 --> 40:12.460
Without one, they can't hold him.
So...

40:14.980 --> 40:17.460
Do you want to put away the bastard
who killed Cosmina Baicu?

40:20.460 --> 40:23.500
You'll have to go to
the Viper Suite at Farlow.

40:23.500 --> 40:25.500
You'll be shown images of eight men.

40:29.500 --> 40:31.460
You'll be asked if you recognise

40:31.460 --> 40:33.460
the man who threatened you
with a handgun.

40:38.300 --> 40:40.460
You'll be asked if you're confident
in your identification.

40:44.300 --> 40:46.460
Number six.

40:48.460 --> 40:50.460
He's number six.

41:03.460 --> 41:04.460
Liz.

41:06.460 --> 41:10.300
They got Kovacs, did you hear?
Erm, yeah.

41:10.300 --> 41:12.980
I... I, erm... I just did the ID.

41:15.300 --> 41:16.460
Arif, erm...

41:22.460 --> 41:24.460
..can you forgive me?

41:27.460 --> 41:29.980
Because you backed Hadley
and not the girl?

41:36.300 --> 41:37.460
I asked myself
what I would have done...

41:39.980 --> 41:41.460
..and I couldn't answer.

41:42.820 --> 41:45.460
So, yeah...

41:45.460 --> 41:47.460
course I fucking forgive you.

41:52.460 --> 41:54.460
I just hope one day it stops,
you know?

41:59.660 --> 42:02.460
Come back. We miss you.

42:05.460 --> 42:06.460
Come here.

42:11.460 --> 42:15.460
You've seen this of course.
Yes, sir.

42:15.460 --> 42:17.460
"CPS declines to prosecute."

42:19.460 --> 42:20.460
You're not happy.

42:22.460 --> 42:23.460
Should I be?

42:23.460 --> 42:27.460
PC Matthews used racist language
to a teenage girl,

42:27.460 --> 42:30.460
PC Adama lied to cover for him,

42:30.460 --> 42:33.300
PC Matthews took by force
the phone which proved

42:33.300 --> 42:34.460
the racist language and the lie...

42:36.140 --> 42:38.460
..and DI Shaw covered
the whole thing up.

42:38.460 --> 42:40.660
Could you prove it?
Any one bit of it?

42:43.460 --> 42:45.460
You got incredibly close,
Sarah, but...

42:45.460 --> 42:47.460
In my opinion, the CPS is sending

42:47.460 --> 42:49.460
a bad message to the public
and the police.

42:49.460 --> 42:52.980
In my opinion, Lizzie Adama
should not remain in the police.

42:52.980 --> 42:55.140
Oh, come on, look what she just did.

42:55.140 --> 42:58.460
ID'd a killer,
a known organised crime figure,

42:58.460 --> 43:00.460
despite the risk to herself.

43:01.460 --> 43:04.140
We need young officers like her.
She's committed, she's brave.

43:04.140 --> 43:05.460
We have to move on.

43:07.460 --> 43:10.460
Northumbria Police
have asked for your help.

43:10.460 --> 43:13.460
It's a tricky one,
a high-speed chase. No.

43:13.460 --> 43:15.820
Homicide command had
a vacancy for a DS.

43:15.820 --> 43:18.460
I applied. I was accepted.

43:18.460 --> 43:20.460
I start in two weeks.

43:21.980 --> 43:24.460
I'd like to thank you
for everything, Sir.

43:25.460 --> 43:27.460
I've learned a lot from you.

43:33.460 --> 43:36.460
Let us have a few moments
of silence.

43:46.460 --> 43:48.660
Thank you very much.

43:51.460 --> 43:53.460
See you back at the car.

44:07.660 --> 44:12.460
Hadley would have wanted me
to say something funny.

44:12.460 --> 44:15.460
I'm sorry, I can't for
the life of me think of anything.

44:15.460 --> 44:17.460
It's just too damn sad.

44:19.460 --> 44:20.500
I'm going to miss him.

44:30.460 --> 44:31.660
Bye, Hadley.

44:37.460 --> 44:38.460
Bye, Hadley.

45:50.460 --> 45:52.460
You weren't at Hadley's funeral.
No.

46:02.460 --> 46:03.980
You're wrong about me.

46:05.460 --> 46:08.460
I'm as good a cop as you are.
I will prove it.

46:14.460 --> 46:15.460
OK, then.

46:21.460 --> 46:24.460
