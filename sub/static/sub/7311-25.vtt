Please authenticate.

00:06.211 --> 00:07.912
Mossad Officer, Ziva David.

00:07.937 --> 00:11.540
Authentication Code...
GIMEL, VAV, HET, SHIN.

00:12.783 --> 00:14.938
Shalom, Officer David.

00:14.963 --> 00:17.041
We need a forced extraction, now.

00:17.066 --> 00:18.309
Target?

00:18.333 --> 00:19.510
Michael.

00:19.534 --> 00:21.980
Rivkin? Have you notified your father?

00:22.004 --> 00:22.814
I'm notifying you.

00:22.838 --> 00:24.582
Who do we have in the area?

00:24.606 --> 00:26.117
How bad? Who do we have?

00:26.141 --> 00:27.652
I will handle it.

00:27.676 --> 00:28.586
He is at my apartment.

00:28.610 --> 00:29.821
I will make sure he stays there.

00:29.845 --> 00:31.779
Someone will be sent.

01:02.444 --> 01:03.878
Oh, my God.

01:04.780 --> 01:06.147
Come on, Michael.

01:07.849 --> 01:09.016
Ziva...

01:10.118 --> 01:11.752
I'm sorry.

01:14.990 --> 01:16.324
Call an ambulance!

01:17.292 --> 01:18.859
Now!

01:19.728 --> 01:21.329
Stay with me. Come on.

01:25.756 --> 01:28.324
Come on!

02:21.323 --> 02:23.958
Excuse me, Ms. David? Yes.

02:31.867 --> 02:33.544
Tony.

02:33.568 --> 02:35.513
I'm okay.

02:35.537 --> 02:39.450
Got a fractured radius and
a couple of bruises, but...

02:39.474 --> 02:41.586
I had new intel.

02:41.610 --> 02:43.988
I went to talk to Ziva.

02:44.012 --> 02:45.657
Question Ziva.

02:45.681 --> 02:47.659
DiNozzo.

02:47.683 --> 02:49.227
When I got there, Rivkin attacked me.

02:49.251 --> 02:50.495
And I had no choice.

02:50.519 --> 02:52.463
DiNozzo.

02:52.487 --> 02:54.899
It was justified.

02:54.923 --> 02:57.268
Go, write it up.

02:57.292 --> 02:59.594
There's gonna have a lot
of people wanting answers.

03:01.597 --> 03:03.141
Rivkin is dead.

03:03.165 --> 03:04.599
Tony killed him.

03:05.934 --> 03:06.978
You saw it?

03:07.002 --> 03:08.012
I saw enough.

03:08.036 --> 03:10.348
Ziva, you have to tell me everything.

03:10.372 --> 03:14.275
You'll have my I-A report
on your desk before lunch.

03:15.577 --> 03:17.188
Hey.

03:17.212 --> 03:19.747
I'm sorry for your loss.

03:26.989 --> 03:28.399
I can't believe I'm finally

03:28.423 --> 03:31.025
going to get to see Ziva's new apartment.

03:33.061 --> 03:36.074
Well, obviously, I wish it was
under better circumstances.

03:36.098 --> 03:38.676
Though it is Ziva's place.

03:38.700 --> 03:41.112
And she's Ziva.

03:41.136 --> 03:42.614
So McGee,

03:42.638 --> 03:44.882
Rivkin, Tony,

03:44.906 --> 03:47.218
Ziva... what do you know?

03:47.242 --> 03:48.809
Nothing.

03:50.245 --> 03:52.957
I saw Tony snooping around Ziva's desk.

03:52.981 --> 03:56.961
It was the day before
she went back to Tel Aviv.

03:56.985 --> 03:58.229
He answered the phone.

03:58.253 --> 04:00.955
I think he talked to Rivkin.

04:04.793 --> 04:06.604
I can't believe I'm telling you this.

04:06.628 --> 04:07.906
Tony's going to kill me.

04:07.930 --> 04:09.941
Not if Mossad gets to him first.

04:09.965 --> 04:12.533
You don't think the director's
going to just hand him over.

04:15.904 --> 04:17.515
Boss, Rivkin tried to kill him.

04:17.539 --> 04:19.684
Tony's word against a dead guy's.

04:19.708 --> 04:21.753
Yeah, but Ziva will back him, right?

04:21.777 --> 04:23.888
Tony doesn't just murder people, you know.

04:23.912 --> 04:25.056
Obviously, the shooting was self-defense.

04:25.080 --> 04:26.480
All we've go to do...

04:47.933 --> 04:49.744
Got a problem, McGee?

04:49.768 --> 04:51.346
You mean apart

04:51.370 --> 04:53.181
from Tony killing Ziva's friend

04:53.205 --> 04:54.449
and Ziva's apartment blowing up?

04:54.473 --> 04:55.750
No, no problem at all.

04:55.774 --> 04:57.141
Good. Then shoot.

05:06.185 --> 05:07.385
Hey, boss.

05:10.656 --> 05:12.000
Laptop.

05:12.024 --> 05:13.268
Kind of.

05:13.292 --> 05:15.904
Floor underneath's barely been touched.

05:15.928 --> 05:17.772
It must have been there
when the fire started.

05:17.796 --> 05:20.175
Under a drawer... a strange
place to keep a laptop.

05:20.199 --> 05:21.933
Not if you're hiding it.

05:23.469 --> 05:27.105
It gives a whole new meaning
to "fried hard drive," huh?

05:28.374 --> 05:30.485
You know, "fried hard
drive," is a computer term.

05:30.509 --> 05:32.410
Yeah, McGee, I got it.

05:35.781 --> 05:37.325
Three cuts in the gas line.

05:37.349 --> 05:38.793
The fire chief said it must have been

05:38.817 --> 05:39.895
leaking for at least an hour.

05:39.919 --> 05:41.963
No one smelled gas.

05:41.987 --> 05:44.266
Which is odd, considering
most of the neighbors were home.

05:44.290 --> 05:45.967
These look clean.

05:45.991 --> 05:47.625
Looks like a pro job.

05:48.627 --> 05:49.827
Huh.

05:52.498 --> 05:54.799
Boss, could be the trigger.

05:57.136 --> 05:59.137
Bag it. Yup.

06:24.463 --> 06:26.931
Ziva.

06:29.602 --> 06:31.346
Would you like a moment?

06:31.370 --> 06:32.948
Not necessary.

06:32.972 --> 06:35.216
While you're here, perhaps you could

06:35.240 --> 06:37.552
shed some light on
Officer Rivkin's beliefs.

06:37.576 --> 06:40.121
I've already contacted
a rabbi friend of mine

06:40.145 --> 06:42.891
and asked him to be present
when I perform the autopsy.

06:42.915 --> 06:44.693
Also not necessary.

06:44.717 --> 06:47.262
Michael was Jewish by birth, not practice.

06:47.286 --> 06:50.765
Traditions can be a comfort.

06:50.789 --> 06:54.236
Like the periods of aninut and avelut.

06:54.260 --> 06:55.103
Ancient rites.

06:55.127 --> 06:56.438
Very appropriate today.

06:56.462 --> 06:58.540
They not only show respect

06:58.564 --> 07:03.511
for the dead, but they also
bring a sense of comfort

07:03.535 --> 07:05.280
to those who are left behind.

07:05.304 --> 07:08.206
Rituals only work for those who need them.

07:12.511 --> 07:14.612
Oh, no.

07:16.582 --> 07:18.026
McGee...

07:18.050 --> 07:20.929
I need you to run a
back-trace on a cell phone.

07:20.953 --> 07:23.098
Sure, I just need the...

07:23.122 --> 07:25.123
number.

07:29.762 --> 07:32.463
Boss, this is Ziva's cell.

07:33.532 --> 07:36.378
You already knew that.

07:36.402 --> 07:38.069
Okay, back-trace on it.

07:59.158 --> 08:00.802
Ziva.

08:00.826 --> 08:03.305
I know what you're going to say, Gibbs.

08:03.329 --> 08:04.896
No, I don't think you do.

08:13.872 --> 08:17.185
I know you think I lied
to you about Rivkin,

08:17.209 --> 08:18.386
but I did not.

08:18.410 --> 08:19.454
You asked me if I knew him.

08:19.478 --> 08:20.722
You asked me if he worked for Mossad.

08:20.746 --> 08:21.856
Not if I was seeing him, not...

08:21.880 --> 08:24.282
Sit down.

08:30.422 --> 08:32.490
Your apartment's been destroyed.

08:34.126 --> 08:36.238
Gas fire... earlier this morning.

08:36.261 --> 08:40.475
Perhaps the line was
damaged during the fight.

08:40.499 --> 08:41.809
I would talk to Tony.

08:41.833 --> 08:43.701
No, this was no accident.

08:45.304 --> 08:46.881
The gas lines were cut.

08:46.905 --> 08:49.507
Any idea...? No.

08:51.110 --> 08:52.387
That was a quick answer.

08:52.411 --> 08:54.212
Simple question.

08:56.181 --> 08:59.261
Ziva...

08:59.285 --> 09:00.929
that's your home.

09:00.953 --> 09:03.221
No, it's not.

09:08.193 --> 09:10.605
This is a thorough report.

09:10.629 --> 09:12.407
You only left out a few little things.

09:12.431 --> 09:15.443
Like why you broke
protocol, why you went alone

09:15.467 --> 09:17.579
and why the hell didn't you inform me.

09:17.603 --> 09:20.215
My gut told me that it
was Rivkin, not Ziva.

09:20.239 --> 09:25.287
And sometimes my gut just sucks.

09:25.311 --> 09:26.922
But if Ziva knew something,

09:26.946 --> 09:30.959
I wanted to give her the
chance to explain it to me.

09:30.983 --> 09:32.727
You wanted to protect her.

09:32.751 --> 09:35.086
She needed it.

09:37.089 --> 09:38.466
Tony's left radius

09:38.490 --> 09:40.335
was fractured during this brawl.

09:40.359 --> 09:41.903
But he and Officer Rivkin

09:41.927 --> 09:44.072
suffered a whole
assortment of other injuries.

09:44.096 --> 09:45.473
All of them consistent

09:45.497 --> 09:47.776
with Tony's version of the story.

09:47.800 --> 09:49.500
Tony told the truth.

09:52.171 --> 09:54.049
This is good news, Jethro.

09:54.073 --> 09:56.651
Doesn't add up.

09:56.675 --> 09:59.220
DiNozzo's more a brawler.

09:59.244 --> 10:01.022
Rivkin was Kidon.

10:01.046 --> 10:04.382
Ah, I thought you'd never ask.

10:10.589 --> 10:13.435
Putting the "why" aside, Agent DiNozzo,

10:13.459 --> 10:16.071
I am, curious how you
got out of there alive.

10:16.095 --> 10:19.140
Well, I've always been
a pretty decent fighter,

10:19.164 --> 10:20.842
if I do say so myself.

10:20.866 --> 10:22.177
Scrappy.

10:22.201 --> 10:24.412
You telling me you offed a Mossad assassin

10:24.436 --> 10:25.814
by being scrappy?

10:25.838 --> 10:27.949
What do you want from me, Director?

10:27.973 --> 10:29.951
Honesty in detail.

10:29.975 --> 10:31.586
Well, that is what I'm trying to do here.

10:31.610 --> 10:34.522
And maybe you're right.
Maybe Rivkin should have won.

10:34.546 --> 10:35.991
But he didn't.

10:36.015 --> 10:37.592
He's dead and I'm not,

10:37.616 --> 10:39.550
and I don't have a concrete reason why.

10:41.654 --> 10:42.998
What's this?

10:43.022 --> 10:44.032
Concrete.

10:44.056 --> 10:46.624
Rivkin was hammered.

10:47.526 --> 10:49.271
He might have had a couple of cocktails,

10:49.295 --> 10:51.539
but, I mean, he was doing

10:51.563 --> 10:54.643
a pretty good job hammering
me. There's no way he was drunk.

10:54.667 --> 10:57.178
Blood alcohol level was .16.

10:57.202 --> 11:00.471
Twice the legal limit to drive.

11:02.775 --> 11:04.019
Huh.

11:04.043 --> 11:05.420
Maybe I should have called him a cab.

11:05.444 --> 11:07.689
You went off grid.

11:07.713 --> 11:09.257
You killed an officer of the Mossad.

11:09.281 --> 11:11.192
And to make things worse,

11:11.216 --> 11:13.194
the entire crime scene
has been blown to hell.

11:13.218 --> 11:14.663
People are going to have some questions.

11:14.687 --> 11:17.255
You'd better have some damn
good answers, Agent DiNozzo.

11:21.293 --> 11:23.194
Understood.

11:31.470 --> 11:34.916
Think your boy can handle
the meat grinder that's coming?

11:34.940 --> 11:36.184
He'll manage.

11:36.208 --> 11:38.753
Good, because he's
going to have to step up,

11:38.777 --> 11:41.389
take one for the team.

11:41.413 --> 11:42.824
What's the end game?

11:42.848 --> 11:44.315
Diplomacy.

11:47.620 --> 11:49.664
Leon. Eli.

11:49.688 --> 11:51.199
Shalom, my friend.

11:51.223 --> 11:54.926
Gives a whole new meaning
to "fried hard drive," huh?

11:57.663 --> 12:00.008
How many tes have you told that joke today?

12:00.032 --> 12:01.666
None.

12:02.534 --> 12:03.912
Maybe once or twice.

12:03.936 --> 12:06.915
Newsflash, Mickey. Now is
not the time for ha-ha's, okay?

12:06.939 --> 12:08.817
Somebody just tried to kill Tony and Ziva.

12:08.841 --> 12:11.720
Ziva's apartment was targeted.

12:11.744 --> 12:13.154
Doesn't mean she was a target.

12:13.178 --> 12:14.623
She could have been.

12:14.647 --> 12:16.057
And what about Tony? He almost died.

12:16.081 --> 12:17.025
He didn't.

12:17.049 --> 12:18.316
He could have.

12:19.084 --> 12:22.130
Sorry. What have you got, McGee?

12:22.154 --> 12:24.733
Rivkin's prints. All over this laptop.

12:24.757 --> 12:26.167
At least what is left of it.

12:26.191 --> 12:28.003
Were you able to get
any intel off the hard drive?

12:28.027 --> 12:29.971
No, it's fried.

12:29.995 --> 12:31.473
Sorry. Dead.

12:31.497 --> 12:33.675
We may be able to partially retrieve

12:33.699 --> 12:34.943
some of the lost data,

12:34.967 --> 12:36.211
but it's going to take
a while. Couple days.

12:36.235 --> 12:37.512
You got one.

12:37.536 --> 12:39.203
Boss, that's not even...

12:41.073 --> 12:43.341
That's a very reasonable request.

12:44.276 --> 12:45.520
Major Mass Spec

12:45.544 --> 12:47.022
is still processing that.

12:47.046 --> 12:48.857
I was thinking it's probably

12:48.881 --> 12:51.783
a salami roll wrapped in s'mores.

12:52.918 --> 12:54.262
Do you have a better idea?

12:54.286 --> 12:56.231
I do.

12:56.255 --> 12:59.234
I know I was told not to involve
myself in the investigation.

12:59.258 --> 13:00.835
Yet here you are.

13:00.859 --> 13:03.438
Since it is my apartment,
I thought I should at least

13:03.462 --> 13:05.273
take a look at the crime scene photographs.

13:05.297 --> 13:06.575
No, Not going to happen.

13:06.599 --> 13:08.209
Not a chance.

13:08.233 --> 13:10.078
Perhaps I should have
made myself more clear.

13:10.102 --> 13:12.570
I have already scanned through the photos.

13:14.440 --> 13:16.708
McGee left them running on his computer.

13:19.311 --> 13:20.555
That being said,

13:20.579 --> 13:23.191
I feel obliged to tell
you what I have found.

13:23.215 --> 13:25.560
Talk.

13:25.584 --> 13:27.762
That is actually an
activated charcoal filter

13:27.786 --> 13:29.531
which has been doused in ethanethiol.

13:29.555 --> 13:31.833
We plant them

13:31.857 --> 13:34.569
on cut gas lines to mask the smell.

13:34.593 --> 13:36.438
That way, a fire can be
triggered without warning.

13:36.462 --> 13:40.064
We? It is s technique
used by many agencies.

13:41.267 --> 13:43.134
Including Mossad.

13:48.173 --> 13:50.141
Pack your bags.

13:54.680 --> 13:56.157
You and DiNozzo, too.

13:56.181 --> 13:57.826
I've been asked a favor.

13:57.850 --> 13:59.261
I've just decided to grant it.

13:59.285 --> 14:01.519
We're on the next flight to Tel Aviv.

15:03.129 --> 15:04.563
Director Vance.

15:05.565 --> 15:07.076
Director David will see you shortly.

15:07.100 --> 15:08.544
He's anxious to speak with you.

15:08.568 --> 15:10.546
As am I.

15:10.570 --> 15:14.316
Officer David.

15:14.340 --> 15:15.540
It's been far too long.

15:18.544 --> 15:20.222
Thank you for coming.

15:20.246 --> 15:22.091
There's no reason to thank me.

15:22.115 --> 15:24.293
My visit has nothing to do with you.

15:24.317 --> 15:27.096
Ziva.

15:27.120 --> 15:28.497
Always full of fire.

15:28.521 --> 15:31.323
Shall I introduce myself?

15:33.926 --> 15:35.704
Officer Amit Hadar,

15:35.728 --> 15:37.362
Special Agent Gibbs.

15:38.197 --> 15:40.499
Special Agent DiNozzo.

15:41.367 --> 15:42.578
Shalom.

15:42.602 --> 15:44.513
Shalom.

15:44.537 --> 15:48.373
Agent DiNozzo, please, ride with me.

15:50.710 --> 15:51.943
I insist.

15:54.046 --> 15:56.715
It will allow us a chance
to get to know one another.

16:03.556 --> 16:07.035
I am going to see him again, right, Leon?

16:07.059 --> 16:09.304
Officer Hadar will not harm him.

16:09.328 --> 16:12.341
Only two people have
the authority to do that.

16:12.365 --> 16:14.343
Your father is one. Second?

16:14.367 --> 16:16.201
Me.

16:50.403 --> 16:51.736
Ziva.

16:53.172 --> 16:56.074
Ziva.

17:00.113 --> 17:02.458
When did you start wearing so much makeup?

17:02.482 --> 17:04.159
Nice to see you, too.

17:04.183 --> 17:06.194
Mm.

17:06.219 --> 17:08.630
With traffic, I wasn't
expecting you for another hour.

17:08.654 --> 17:09.964
I drove.

17:09.989 --> 17:11.266
Enough said.

17:11.290 --> 17:13.301
Sit.

17:13.326 --> 17:14.925
Sit.

17:19.165 --> 17:21.143
Hmm.

17:21.166 --> 17:22.511
So, tell me, how are you?

17:22.535 --> 17:24.279
I have been better.

17:24.303 --> 17:26.515
Michael was a good man.

17:26.539 --> 17:27.849
Loyal.

17:27.874 --> 17:29.618
Loyal to whom?

17:29.642 --> 17:31.253
To all of us.

17:31.277 --> 17:33.155
I'm not certain that is true.

17:33.179 --> 17:34.823
You're angry.

17:34.847 --> 17:37.860
I am confused.

17:37.884 --> 17:40.295
That is why I asked you here.

17:40.319 --> 17:41.430
To find answers?

17:41.454 --> 17:43.488
No, my dear. To find solace.

17:44.657 --> 17:47.692
You leave finding the answers to me.

18:01.974 --> 18:05.020
My daughter speaks very highly of you.

18:05.044 --> 18:06.588
She's a good agent.

18:06.612 --> 18:08.891
Liaison officer.

18:08.915 --> 18:11.527
She's one of us.

18:11.551 --> 18:13.429
So she tells me.

18:13.453 --> 18:17.222
So's the guy in there.

18:26.799 --> 18:29.478
Agent DiNozzo...

18:29.502 --> 18:31.647
my sincere apologies for your wait.

18:31.671 --> 18:33.348
That's okay.

18:33.372 --> 18:35.317
I dig hanging out in concrete bunkers.

18:35.341 --> 18:39.354
Especially after 12-hour
plane rides in cramped quarters.

18:39.378 --> 18:41.924
Your sarcasm is noted.

18:41.948 --> 18:43.025
So's your shirt.

18:43.049 --> 18:44.493
Nice style. What is it?

18:44.517 --> 18:47.296
Zegna? Cavalli? You got good taste.

18:47.320 --> 18:50.833
I'm not certain how my
apparel applies to your visit.

18:50.857 --> 18:55.093
And I am not certain how you
can classify my visit... as a visit.

18:56.562 --> 19:00.275
All right. Just so we understand,

19:00.299 --> 19:02.678
this is what I do for a living.

19:02.702 --> 19:04.680
I interrogate people all day long.

19:04.704 --> 19:06.715
So I know all the tricks of the trade.

19:06.739 --> 19:10.018
And nothing that you do
is going to intimidate me.

19:10.042 --> 19:13.355
Interrogate?

19:13.379 --> 19:19.151
This is an Assembly Room.
It's a place for mutual discussion.

19:20.286 --> 19:22.898
You have yet to see our Interrogation Room.

19:22.922 --> 19:26.001
But if you continue
with childish arrogance,

19:26.025 --> 19:28.059
I promise that you will.

19:30.096 --> 19:31.540
Son of a bitch.

19:31.564 --> 19:33.008
How many times did I tell DiNozzo

19:33.032 --> 19:35.277
to leave his smart-ass attitude back in DC?

19:35.301 --> 19:37.246
You should have checked his bags.

19:37.270 --> 19:38.847
I thought you said
your boy was up for this.

19:38.871 --> 19:41.350
You're the one who threw
him to the wolves, Leon.

19:41.374 --> 19:43.085
Let him fight his own way.

19:43.109 --> 19:44.219
You call this a fight?

19:44.243 --> 19:45.587
He'd better start showing me something.

19:45.611 --> 19:47.813
Taking one for the team?

19:49.348 --> 19:51.693
He already has.

19:51.717 --> 19:55.230
No, Agent DiNozzo, what
you need to understand

19:55.254 --> 19:59.201
is that I am very aware of who you are.

19:59.225 --> 20:02.504
Your achievements and your misjudgments.

20:02.528 --> 20:03.705
Okay.

20:03.729 --> 20:06.909
Stop right there. If this
is about my Twitter page,

20:06.933 --> 20:08.077
I just want to clarify.

20:08.101 --> 20:11.013
I had a couple of cocktails,
and, what can I say?

20:11.037 --> 20:12.314
Sometimes I get a little chatty.

20:12.338 --> 20:15.417
Do you know who I am?

20:15.441 --> 20:17.809
You're the director of Mossad.

20:19.145 --> 20:20.622
And Ziva's father.

20:20.646 --> 20:23.092
Although I'm not sure which
one's asking the questions.

20:23.116 --> 20:26.895
Sometimes it is hard to separate.

20:26.919 --> 20:29.131
And it appears that you have had difficulty

20:29.155 --> 20:31.356
separating your work
from your emotions, as well.

20:32.792 --> 20:36.338
You believed Officer Rivkin was bad?

20:36.362 --> 20:38.674
He killed an American agent.

20:38.698 --> 20:40.042
An accident.

20:40.066 --> 20:41.376
Unlike his death,

20:41.400 --> 20:44.302
which was intentional.

20:44.937 --> 20:46.849
But what...

20:46.873 --> 20:50.285
was behind that intent?

20:50.309 --> 20:51.820
Retribution...

20:51.844 --> 20:54.656
for an agent you had never even met?

20:54.680 --> 21:00.662
You knew that Officer Rivkin
would be at Ziva's apartment.

21:00.686 --> 21:04.867
You went there to confront him,

21:04.891 --> 21:06.535
to provoke him.

21:06.559 --> 21:08.303
And once again,

21:08.327 --> 21:09.838
you blurred the lines, Agent DiNozzo,

21:09.862 --> 21:12.741
between your professional
duty and your personal desires.

21:12.765 --> 21:15.244
You wanted Rivkin

21:15.268 --> 21:18.403
out of my daughter's
life, so you killed him.

21:19.639 --> 21:22.651
Isn't that the truth, Agent DiNoo?

21:22.675 --> 21:24.253
It's like I told your director.

21:24.277 --> 21:26.488
I went to Officer David's apartment,

21:26.512 --> 21:29.581
at which time Officer Rivkin attacked me.

21:31.484 --> 21:33.018
It was kill or be killed.

21:37.023 --> 21:39.735
If that were true, my friend,

21:39.759 --> 21:41.837
you would be dead.

21:41.861 --> 21:44.139
You wouldn't mind that, would you?

21:44.163 --> 21:46.742
You send all your rogue agents to DC?

21:46.766 --> 21:48.977
Make it our mess? Huh?

21:49.001 --> 21:50.546
I guess I shouldn't

21:50.570 --> 21:51.713
be surprised about Rivkin,

21:51.737 --> 21:54.216
considering you did
the same thing with Ari,

21:54.240 --> 21:55.717
and he was your son.

21:55.741 --> 21:57.486
Speaking of family,

21:57.510 --> 21:59.154
what kind of a father would throw

21:59.178 --> 22:00.889
an out-of-control assassin
at his own daughter?

22:00.913 --> 22:03.959
What kind of business
are you running here, huh?

22:03.983 --> 22:07.362
Everyone just runs around
doing whatever the hell they want?

22:07.386 --> 22:09.198
They do as I say. Rivkin?

22:09.222 --> 22:10.622
Always.

22:24.504 --> 22:26.238
Well, I'll be damned.

22:34.180 --> 22:36.024
Yeah. Gibbs.

22:36.048 --> 22:37.192
Hey, boss. How's Tel Aviv?

22:37.216 --> 22:38.861
Forget Tel Aviv. How's Tony? How's Ziva?

22:38.885 --> 22:41.086
Are they talking yet?
They're fine, Abby.

22:42.021 --> 22:43.232
I'll take that as a no.

22:43.256 --> 22:44.333
So, how is Israel?

22:44.357 --> 22:46.301
What? He said they're fine.

22:46.325 --> 22:47.536
It's magical, right?

22:47.560 --> 22:49.271
I mean, I've been wanting to go there

22:49.295 --> 22:51.173
for years... it's, like, third on my list.

22:51.197 --> 22:52.241
The Galapagos Islands

22:52.265 --> 22:54.309
and, of course, Dollywood. Gibbs?

22:54.333 --> 22:55.778
The case, Abby.

22:55.802 --> 22:58.814
McGee and I, we've been
working on Rivkin's computer,

22:58.838 --> 22:59.982
and, um...

23:00.006 --> 23:01.683
we're doing fairly well.

23:01.707 --> 23:03.218
Uh, with a little luck,

23:03.242 --> 23:05.454
I think we'll make our 24-hour deadline.

23:05.478 --> 23:06.622
Boss,

23:06.646 --> 23:08.457
I ran the back-trace on Ziva's cell.

23:08.481 --> 23:09.925
Most of the calls check out.

23:09.949 --> 23:10.926
Most?

23:10.950 --> 23:11.927
Well, she did make

23:11.951 --> 23:13.595
one call from her car two nights ago

23:13.619 --> 23:16.165
to a highly encrypted
phone, Israeli registered.

23:16.189 --> 23:18.000
Call was placed just after midnight.

23:18.024 --> 23:19.568
Six hours before the bombing.

23:19.592 --> 23:22.438
Which means either Ziva
really upset someone or...

23:22.462 --> 23:24.173
Don't say it.

23:24.197 --> 23:26.675
She was somehow involved.

23:26.699 --> 23:28.300
What'd I just say?

23:29.502 --> 23:31.113
I traced the Israeli phone.

23:31.137 --> 23:35.140
It's registered to... Officer Amit Hadar.

23:44.016 --> 23:45.127
Now talk.

23:45.151 --> 23:47.262
Ziva, what is this? I said talk.

23:47.286 --> 23:48.453
You called me, remember?

23:49.489 --> 23:51.400
To remove Rivkin from harm.

23:51.424 --> 23:53.168
Harm from whom? Himself.

23:53.192 --> 23:54.536
Circumstances had changed.

23:54.560 --> 23:55.771
And this was your answer?

23:55.795 --> 23:57.139
I protect the Mossad.

23:57.163 --> 23:59.408
There was nothing to protect!

23:59.432 --> 24:00.943
I should have known not to trust you.

24:00.967 --> 24:02.578
As if it was my decision.

24:02.602 --> 24:04.012
You have my father's ear!

24:04.036 --> 24:05.414
Rivkin was in chaos.

24:05.438 --> 24:06.515
You knew.

24:06.539 --> 24:09.251
And yet you decided
not to tell your father.

24:09.275 --> 24:11.854
You tried to protect Rivkin,

24:11.878 --> 24:14.579
but in truth, you are the reason he's dead.

24:19.085 --> 24:20.863
Rivkin killed that American agent.

24:20.887 --> 24:21.897
You knew this!

24:21.921 --> 24:23.665
And still you did not report him!

24:23.689 --> 24:25.701
I called you and I told you to remove him!

24:25.725 --> 24:29.071
Too late! By then, we could
not get him out of the country.

24:29.095 --> 24:32.274
All we could do was clean up after him.

24:32.298 --> 24:34.232
And you.

24:38.037 --> 24:40.416
There is no one left to blame.

24:40.440 --> 24:41.873
Stop looking.

24:57.123 --> 24:59.601
Hadar set the fire.

24:59.625 --> 25:01.670
Covering for Rivkin.

25:01.694 --> 25:03.205
I was betrayed...

25:03.229 --> 25:05.774
by Mossad, by my father, by Tony.

25:05.798 --> 25:07.232
Who's next?

25:08.167 --> 25:09.601
You?

25:22.645 --> 25:24.846
Pardon me, Director.

25:28.317 --> 25:30.619
Ziva.

25:34.557 --> 25:35.734
Hmm.

25:35.758 --> 25:38.827
Your Agent Gibbs is making
my people very nervous.

25:40.429 --> 25:41.506
He slipped through security.

25:41.530 --> 25:43.508
Any idea where he might be going?

25:43.532 --> 25:45.944
Knowing Gibbs, a coffee n?

25:45.968 --> 25:48.870
Man practically mainlines caffeine.

25:54.644 --> 25:55.587
Thank you.

25:55.611 --> 25:56.945
Mmm.

25:57.980 --> 25:59.491
It's been a long time, my friend.

25:59.515 --> 26:00.682
Amsterdam.

26:02.118 --> 26:04.663
How did it get this far?

26:04.687 --> 26:08.166
Simple. One of your agents
killed one of my agents.

26:08.190 --> 26:10.369
Now, we both know that's
not where this started.

26:10.393 --> 26:12.304
I notified you of the sleeper cell.

26:12.328 --> 26:14.373
Your guy was already knee-deep in it.

26:14.397 --> 26:16.908
You don't trust we can
police our own backyard.

26:16.932 --> 26:20.379
The view from where
I sit is quite different.

26:20.403 --> 26:21.970
The threats are...

26:23.306 --> 26:24.616
immediate.

26:24.640 --> 26:26.385
Unfortunately, I do not have

26:26.409 --> 26:28.120
the luxury of patience.

26:28.144 --> 26:30.345
Sometimes patience is a necessity.

26:31.514 --> 26:32.791
Otherwise you end up making

26:32.815 --> 26:34.026
an enemy out of your friend.

26:34.050 --> 26:35.928
And then we end up

26:35.952 --> 26:37.796
with a dead American and a dead Israeli.

26:37.820 --> 26:40.722
And I know that's the last
thing either one of us wants.

26:45.494 --> 26:47.639
Rivkin wasn't a rogue agent.

26:47.663 --> 26:50.275
He was following your
orders... you said so yourself.

26:50.299 --> 26:53.712
I underestimated Agent DiNozzo.

26:53.736 --> 26:56.381
You sent him in there to rile me up.

26:56.405 --> 26:58.373
I learned from the best.

27:00.142 --> 27:02.521
There's a terrorist training camp

27:02.545 --> 27:04.089
somewhere in North Africa.

27:04.113 --> 27:06.224
We have not been able to pinpoint...

27:06.248 --> 27:07.926
anything exact,

27:07.950 --> 27:10.996
but we managed to identify
one of the their sleeper cells

27:11.020 --> 27:12.064
in Los Angeles.

27:12.088 --> 27:13.732
So you sent Rivkin to L.A.?

27:13.756 --> 27:16.635
He was on an end run.

27:16.659 --> 27:19.871
Find the leader of the cell,
he gives up the handler;

27:19.895 --> 27:22.040
Find the handler, he gives up the location

27:22.064 --> 27:23.175
of the training camp.

27:23.199 --> 27:24.810
And he kills them along the way.

27:24.834 --> 27:26.411
Including the handler.

27:26.435 --> 27:29.381
You can hardly leave those
people behind to come after you.

27:29.405 --> 27:30.882
Oh, I understand, Eli.

27:30.906 --> 27:32.851
I don't judge you.

27:32.875 --> 27:34.319
I never have.

27:34.343 --> 27:37.256
Unfortunately, I cannot trust

27:37.280 --> 27:39.424
everyone in your intelligence community

27:39.448 --> 27:41.660
to be as understanding as you.

27:41.684 --> 27:44.496
So you had Rivkin spy on them.

27:44.520 --> 27:45.764
Yeah.

27:45.788 --> 27:50.892
The death of the American
agent was an accident.

27:54.830 --> 27:57.843
Rivkin never got the intel
about the training camp, did he?

27:57.867 --> 27:59.611
All this to find a camp

27:59.635 --> 28:01.747
that's probably already been moved.

28:01.771 --> 28:03.815
It's not about the camp.

28:03.839 --> 28:05.817
It's the man who runs it.

28:05.841 --> 28:07.920
Well, he must be very important to you.

28:07.944 --> 28:10.779
He killed one of my people.

28:23.693 --> 28:26.505
I had no choice. That's a lie.

28:26.529 --> 28:29.741
Why would I lie to you, Ziva?
To save your worthless ass.

28:29.765 --> 28:31.543
From who? Vance?

28:31.567 --> 28:32.711
Mossad?

28:32.735 --> 28:35.681
You jeopardized your
entire career, and for what?

28:35.705 --> 28:37.739
For you.

28:39.108 --> 28:40.452
He was playing you, Ziva.

28:40.476 --> 28:43.422
For some reason, you felt it
was your job to protect me?

28:43.446 --> 28:45.958
I did what I had to do.
You killed him.

28:45.982 --> 28:48.794
If I hadn't, you'd be having
this conversation with him.

28:48.818 --> 28:50.529
But maybe that's the way you'd prefer it.

28:50.553 --> 28:52.064
Perhaps I would!

28:52.088 --> 28:53.665
Okay, why don't you just get this out.

28:53.689 --> 28:55.701
You want to take a punch, take a swing?

28:55.725 --> 28:58.660
Get it out of your system! Go ahead, do it!

28:59.996 --> 29:01.773
Be careful, Tony,

29:01.797 --> 29:05.077
because, much like
Michael, I only need one.

29:05.101 --> 29:08.113
And that's what you're
really angry about, isn't it?

29:08.137 --> 29:09.915
That's what's bothering you.

29:09.939 --> 29:11.450
It's not that he's dead.

29:11.474 --> 29:13.919
It's that your Mossad
boyfriend got his ass kicked

29:13.943 --> 29:15.487
by a chump like me.

29:15.511 --> 29:16.989
You took advantage of him.

29:17.013 --> 29:18.023
He attacked me.

29:18.047 --> 29:20.192
What was I supposed...

29:20.216 --> 29:22.761
You saw a glass table, you pushed him back,

29:22.785 --> 29:23.829
you dropped him on it,

29:23.853 --> 29:25.097
He was impaled in the side

29:25.121 --> 29:26.431
by a shard of glass...

29:26.455 --> 29:28.600
bloody, gasping for air!

29:28.624 --> 29:30.302
I guess you read my report.

29:30.326 --> 29:32.437
I memorized it! You
could have left it at that,

29:32.461 --> 29:35.040
you could've walked
away, but no, you let him up!

29:35.064 --> 29:37.476
You put a bullet in his
chest! You weren't there.

29:37.500 --> 29:40.178
You could've put one in his leg!

29:40.202 --> 29:42.881
You... weren't... there.

29:42.905 --> 29:44.205
But I should've been!

29:46.909 --> 29:48.353
You loved him.

29:48.377 --> 29:52.547
I guess I'll never know.

29:58.421 --> 30:00.399
What do you got, Abbs?

30:00.423 --> 30:01.934
Hey, Gibbs. Wow, it's my first

30:01.958 --> 30:03.802
trans-global "What do you got, Abbs?"

30:03.826 --> 30:06.571
Think maybe I could get a
trans-global Caf-POW delivery?

30:06.595 --> 30:08.473
Depends on what you have.

30:08.497 --> 30:12.210
We did a postmortem Humpty
Dumpty on Rivkin's laptop.

30:12.234 --> 30:13.478
And we were able to reconstruct

30:13.502 --> 30:15.280
most of the data from his hard drive.

30:15.304 --> 30:16.748
He used a specialized algorithm

30:16.772 --> 30:18.383
to generate a well-harbored short key

30:18.407 --> 30:19.651
for most of his files.

30:19.675 --> 30:20.953
But we managed to crack

30:20.977 --> 30:23.522
both the algorithm and the ISP protocols.

30:23.546 --> 30:25.390
What's the point, McGee?

30:25.414 --> 30:27.225
Basically, we... we put his
hard drive back together,

30:27.249 --> 30:28.360
and as it turns out...

30:28.384 --> 30:30.662
It's not Rivkin's laptop.

30:30.686 --> 30:31.597
So we got nothing.

30:31.621 --> 30:32.598
No, actually,

30:32.622 --> 30:33.799
boss, we have everything.

30:33.823 --> 30:35.100
This laptop

30:35.124 --> 30:37.536
belonged to Abin Tabal.

30:37.560 --> 30:38.537
Our dead handler?

30:38.561 --> 30:40.038
Yep, that's the one.

30:40.062 --> 30:43.075
Rivkin probably switched
laptops after he killed him.

30:43.099 --> 30:45.911
Throws us off and gives
Rivkin all the intel he needed.

30:45.935 --> 30:47.746
We've got serial numbers, names

30:47.770 --> 30:49.581
and cell phone numbers,
all linked to various

30:49.605 --> 30:51.149
locations in North Africa.

30:51.173 --> 30:53.285
And that's not all, Gibbs. Um,

30:53.309 --> 30:56.355
we were able to decrypt
Rivkin's e-mail accounts.

30:56.379 --> 31:01.159
Which was only half the battle,
because it was in Hebrew and...

31:01.183 --> 31:02.494
Hebrew is hard.

31:02.518 --> 31:05.564
Apparently, Rivkin was in DC
working with Mossad contacts

31:05.588 --> 31:08.133
to gather intel on a
terrorist training camp.

31:08.157 --> 31:10.058
Who were his contacts?

31:12.628 --> 31:16.642
Well, we-we traced
several e-mails to, um...

31:16.666 --> 31:18.510
a restricted account.

31:18.534 --> 31:20.512
A very...

31:20.536 --> 31:22.080
very restricted account.

31:22.104 --> 31:23.571
Restricted by who?

31:26.809 --> 31:28.810
Us, Gibbs.

31:30.980 --> 31:32.758
Rivkin was e-mailing Ziva...

31:32.782 --> 31:34.693
At NCIS.

31:34.717 --> 31:36.561
Boss, you know that this means Ziva knew...

31:36.585 --> 31:37.763
Yeah, I got it, McGee.

31:37.787 --> 31:39.965
It means Ziva was withholding

31:39.989 --> 31:43.224
vital... I said I got it, Abby!

31:51.601 --> 31:54.012
You told Michael to
stay with me in DC. Why?

31:54.036 --> 31:55.314
That is none of your concern.

31:55.338 --> 31:57.215
I have made it my concern.

31:57.239 --> 31:59.384
Do not question me, Ziva.

31:59.408 --> 32:00.886
Was any of it real?

32:00.910 --> 32:02.754
Does it matter?

32:02.778 --> 32:03.989
Michael is gone.

32:04.013 --> 32:05.123
You must move on.

32:05.147 --> 32:06.725
It's no longer about him.

32:06.749 --> 32:08.594
Agent DiNozzo?

32:08.618 --> 32:10.062
I need to know if he was right.

32:10.086 --> 32:11.430
He was jealous.

32:11.454 --> 32:13.165
Even if that were true, that
does not make him wrong.

32:13.189 --> 32:14.399
Now, answer me!

32:14.423 --> 32:15.634
Was it real?

32:15.658 --> 32:17.169
I don't know.

32:17.193 --> 32:18.370
Perhaps.

32:18.394 --> 32:20.472
Why was I not told the
details of his mission?

32:20.496 --> 32:21.907
Why was I excluded?

32:21.931 --> 32:25.043
Because, Ziva, I don't know
who you answer to anymore.

32:25.067 --> 32:26.845
NCIS? Or Mossad?

32:26.869 --> 32:28.680
What is it you expect from me?

32:28.704 --> 32:30.649
I expect your loyalty.

32:30.673 --> 32:32.651
To me and only me!

32:32.675 --> 32:35.020
You want to know Michael's assignment?

32:35.044 --> 32:36.421
Make this your Aliyah.

32:36.445 --> 32:38.490
You return to me, to us.

32:38.514 --> 32:40.715
You finish what Michael started.

32:46.055 --> 32:47.432
So, that's it, right?

32:47.456 --> 32:48.734
I'm done with Israel?

32:48.758 --> 32:50.068
We're not coming back here?

32:50.092 --> 32:51.470
Get on the plane, DiNozzo.

32:51.494 --> 32:53.171
All right, you got it, boss.

32:53.195 --> 32:54.763
Take her easy.

32:57.667 --> 33:01.013
Our people pulled this off
the laptop Rivkin was using.

33:01.037 --> 33:02.981
Should answer a lot of your questions.

33:03.005 --> 33:04.616
Thank you.

33:04.640 --> 33:06.485
And thank Miss Sciuto, as well.

33:06.509 --> 33:08.854
Is there anything you don't know?

33:08.878 --> 33:11.156
Not anymore.

33:11.180 --> 33:12.557
Happy hunting, Eli.

33:12.581 --> 33:14.082
Shalom, my friend.

33:30.433 --> 33:31.433
Gibbs.

33:32.068 --> 33:34.279
Plane leaves in five minutes, Ziva.

33:34.303 --> 33:36.214
Not without us, it doesn't.

33:36.238 --> 33:38.884
I think it is best if I simply
speak from the heart.

33:38.908 --> 33:40.953
Well, yeah, it usually is.

33:40.977 --> 33:42.888
It's Tony.

33:42.912 --> 33:45.290
I am still not convinced that he has been

33:45.314 --> 33:47.826
entirely truthful about Michael's...

33:47.850 --> 33:49.951
Rivkin's shooting.

33:50.786 --> 33:52.531
He gave you his word.

33:52.555 --> 33:55.267
I am not sure we can work together.

33:55.291 --> 33:58.804
Perhaps it is best if one of us

33:58.828 --> 34:00.572
gets transferred to another team.

34:00.596 --> 34:02.797
Transferred?

34:04.567 --> 34:06.912
I need to be able to trust
the people that I work with.

34:06.936 --> 34:10.672
I know you, more than
anyone, understands that.

34:26.522 --> 34:28.723
Take care of yourself.

34:40.870 --> 34:42.637
Boss?

34:44.139 --> 34:45.373
One short?

34:48.043 --> 34:49.244
Good to go.

35:29.015 --> 35:30.626
Are they here yet?!

35:30.650 --> 35:33.329
Abbs, I told you, I'll call
you as soon as they show up.

35:33.353 --> 35:34.630
Scout's honor.

35:34.654 --> 35:35.731
That's too late, McGee.

35:35.755 --> 35:37.433
It's not an official "Welcome Back".

35:37.457 --> 35:39.468
I mean, if I'm here and they walk in,

35:39.492 --> 35:41.303
I get to say, "Yay, welcome back"".

35:41.327 --> 35:43.172
If they're already here and I come in

35:43.196 --> 35:44.807
like Miss Tardy to the party,

35:44.831 --> 35:46.609
then technically it's like
them welcoming me back.

35:46.633 --> 35:47.776
Tell him, Palmer.

35:47.800 --> 35:50.902
Uh, she... she makes a good point.

35:52.839 --> 35:55.240
I saw that, Palmer!

35:57.510 --> 35:59.955
Okay, their flight's arrived.
Where are they?

35:59.979 --> 36:00.923
Behind you.

36:00.947 --> 36:02.358
Yay!

36:02.382 --> 36:03.425
Welcome back!

36:03.449 --> 36:04.727
Watch the... We missed you!

36:04.751 --> 36:06.662
Sorry.
That's all right. Missed you too, Abbs.

36:06.686 --> 36:07.696
Tony, I...

36:07.720 --> 36:09.021
Jimmy.

36:10.023 --> 36:12.134
So, Ziva's getting her stuff or...?

36:12.158 --> 36:13.168
No.

36:13.192 --> 36:15.170
She parking her car?

36:15.194 --> 36:16.672
No.

36:16.696 --> 36:18.073
Well, what is she doing?

36:18.097 --> 36:20.175
Well, considering the time difference,

36:20.199 --> 36:21.510
probably eating breakfast.

36:21.534 --> 36:23.379
She's still in Tel Aviv?

36:23.403 --> 36:24.513
Yep.

36:24.537 --> 36:25.981
Well, when is she coming back?

36:26.005 --> 36:27.349
She's not.

36:27.373 --> 36:30.219
No! This cannot happen!

36:30.243 --> 36:31.987
Vance cannot do this again!

36:32.011 --> 36:34.079
Wasn't Vance's call.

36:35.982 --> 36:39.584
Well, if it wasn't Vance, then who?

36:40.653 --> 36:41.697
Jethro,

36:41.721 --> 36:44.056
forgive the intrusion.

36:44.824 --> 36:47.269
How did you possibly manage to...

36:47.293 --> 36:48.938
Aw, geez, Duck,

36:48.962 --> 36:51.840
you gonna ask me that every time?

36:51.864 --> 36:54.276
How was your flight?

36:54.300 --> 36:55.667
One short.

36:58.271 --> 37:01.483
Yeah, I know this decision

37:01.507 --> 37:03.118
must not have come easily.

37:03.142 --> 37:04.420
It wasn't my decision.

37:04.444 --> 37:05.421
But Tony said...

37:05.445 --> 37:07.489
No.

37:07.513 --> 37:09.124
Ziva's.

37:09.148 --> 37:10.859
The moment she asked me to choose.

37:10.883 --> 37:12.928
Ah, so this is not about loyalty,

37:12.952 --> 37:17.166
it's about an unreasonable demand.

37:17.190 --> 37:19.268
She withheld information.

37:19.292 --> 37:20.659
To protect Rivkin.

37:22.195 --> 37:24.506
Someone she obviously cared about.

37:24.530 --> 37:27.810
Ziva has always remained
an officer of Mossad.

37:27.834 --> 37:29.945
I certainly don't envy

37:29.969 --> 37:32.481
the position that she
just found herself in.

37:32.505 --> 37:33.616
Considering her

37:33.640 --> 37:35.784
less-than-conspicuous background,

37:35.808 --> 37:38.644
it's amazing she ever had your trust.

37:41.281 --> 37:42.758
No, she earned it.

37:42.782 --> 37:45.027
But you took to Ziva

37:45.051 --> 37:47.663
more quickly than any
other agent before her.

37:47.687 --> 37:50.099
Timothy, Caitlin, even DiNozzo.

37:50.123 --> 37:55.704
I've always sensed
that there's a strong bond

37:55.728 --> 37:57.206
between the two of you.

37:57.230 --> 37:59.831
Something shared, perhaps.

38:10.476 --> 38:13.389
No.

38:13.413 --> 38:14.623
She proved herself.

38:14.647 --> 38:16.692
Whatever it was that Ziva did

38:16.716 --> 38:18.694
to prove her loyalty,

38:18.718 --> 38:20.162
well, it was not nearly

38:20.186 --> 38:22.054
as momentous as you believed.

38:24.223 --> 38:25.557
Or was it?

39:08.701 --> 39:11.380
Went over the personnel
files, like you asked.

39:11.404 --> 39:13.048
There's a couple that stood out.

39:13.072 --> 39:15.718
Both would be a good fit.

39:15.742 --> 39:18.387
Take your pick.

39:18.411 --> 39:20.322
I'll let you know in a few months.

39:20.346 --> 39:22.214
Yeah, I knew it couldn't be that easy.

39:24.117 --> 39:25.594
You think she might ask to come back?

39:25.618 --> 39:27.129
I'm just giving her time.

39:27.153 --> 39:28.230
That's all.

39:28.254 --> 39:29.431
Time to what?

39:29.455 --> 39:32.968
Remember who she can trust.

39:32.992 --> 39:34.637
Let me make it easy for you, Gibbs.

39:34.661 --> 39:36.572
You made the right call.

39:36.596 --> 39:38.807
I wasn't asking for your opinion, Leon.

39:38.831 --> 39:40.542
Just who the hell you
think you're talking to?

39:40.566 --> 39:42.411
That's a good damn question.

39:42.435 --> 39:44.213
I've been wondering about that for a while.

39:44.237 --> 39:46.382
You know, you spend half
your time second-guessing me.

39:46.406 --> 39:49.418
Studying me, testing me.
I'm looking for answers.

39:49.442 --> 39:51.610
It'd help if you'd ask the damn questions.

39:53.146 --> 39:54.890
There's the rub.

39:54.914 --> 39:56.558
You don't have a clue what to ask.

39:56.582 --> 39:58.260
You don't trust me, but you don't know why.

39:58.284 --> 39:59.762
You want to talk about trust?

39:59.786 --> 40:02.031
What about tearing apart my team last year?

40:02.055 --> 40:04.033
There was no warning,
there was no discussion.

40:04.057 --> 40:05.367
Is that what this is about?

40:05.391 --> 40:06.902
You want to sit in the big chair.

40:06.926 --> 40:07.937
No, I don't.

40:07.961 --> 40:09.471
I want to trust whoever does sit there!

40:09.495 --> 40:11.640
I want to protect my team.

40:11.664 --> 40:12.675
Like Ziva?

40:12.699 --> 40:13.842
Okay, fine.

40:13.866 --> 40:16.512
You made the decision
to leave her in Tel Aviv.

40:16.536 --> 40:17.947
I supported you.

40:17.971 --> 40:19.448
And now you might want to let her back.

40:19.472 --> 40:20.549
Why?

40:20.573 --> 40:22.051
Because whatever she might have done,

40:22.075 --> 40:25.243
I trust her for what I know she did.

40:27.647 --> 40:29.425
Four years ago...

40:29.449 --> 40:30.926
She saved your life.

40:30.950 --> 40:32.661
By shooting

40:32.685 --> 40:34.620
and killing her half-brother, Ari.

40:36.189 --> 40:37.856
I told you the chair was big.

40:39.859 --> 40:41.570
Ari was out of control.

40:41.594 --> 40:44.696
So, Ziva's father sent
her to eliminate him.

40:46.332 --> 40:48.978
She kills Ari, earns your trust.

40:49.002 --> 40:51.480
Two birds, one bullet.

40:51.504 --> 40:53.315
Eli played you.

40:53.339 --> 40:55.951
But regardless, Gibbs, up until now, Ziva's

40:55.975 --> 40:58.887
always been loyal to this agency.

40:58.911 --> 41:02.124
I know you don't want to hear this, Gibbs.

41:02.148 --> 41:03.525
But now you have to trust me.

41:03.549 --> 41:07.396
And if you're right about
Ziva's allegiance to you,

41:07.420 --> 41:09.465
she'll serve us well at Mossad.

41:09.489 --> 41:14.703
Yeah, and if you're
right about her father...

41:14.727 --> 41:18.997
we'll never see her again.

41:42.689 --> 41:45.724
Guess she'll call when she's ready.

42:53.826 --> 42:56.972
Tell me everything you know...

42:56.996 --> 42:58.430
about NCIS.
