00:01.697 --> 00:02.306
<i>Previously onChesapeake Shores ...</i>

00:02.350 --> 00:03.612
Welcome home, honey!

00:03.655 --> 00:04.700
Oh!

00:04.743 --> 00:05.701
Jerome Trask!

00:05.744 --> 00:06.745
-No!
-Yes!

00:06.789 --> 00:07.877
I don't know who that is.

00:07.920 --> 00:08.704
Jess, it was
my high-school nemesis.

00:08.747 --> 00:10.097
I'm gonna meet with him,

00:10.140 --> 00:11.315
and I'm gonna be the best
playwright in residence

00:11.359 --> 00:13.013
the U of M has ever seen.

00:13.056 --> 00:15.102
When you become part
of a family like the Pecks,

00:15.145 --> 00:16.320
it's a big responsibility,

00:16.364 --> 00:17.452
so you want to make sure

00:17.495 --> 00:19.193
that your rights
are clearly spelled out.

00:19.236 --> 00:20.411
A prenup?

00:20.455 --> 00:21.238
They're trying to build
a case against us

00:21.282 --> 00:23.023
There is no "us".

00:23.066 --> 00:24.372
You'll be hearing
from my attorney.

00:24.415 --> 00:26.635
Luke Tatum, how have you been?

00:26.678 --> 00:28.376
-After high school, you kinda--
-Disappeared?

00:28.419 --> 00:30.508
That was a kiss goodbye,
wasn't it?

00:37.689 --> 00:40.040
Hey, so, how was London?

00:40.083 --> 00:42.042
'Cause, I mean, the videos
you sent looked amazing.

00:42.085 --> 00:43.043
It was.

00:43.086 --> 00:45.349
And, wait,
did you see Simon?

00:45.393 --> 00:46.785
Yeah. Yeah, we had
dinner a few times.

00:46.829 --> 00:48.265
Really?

00:48.309 --> 00:50.746
Mm-hmm, dinner with him
and his new girlfriend.

00:50.789 --> 00:52.095
Ah...

00:52.139 --> 00:53.618
It's fine.

00:53.662 --> 00:56.404
We've both moved on, and...

00:56.447 --> 00:58.101
she's really nice.

00:58.145 --> 01:00.408
Hmm. That's nice.

01:00.451 --> 01:01.713
It's very adult of me.

01:02.801 --> 01:04.020
But do you know what?

01:04.064 --> 01:05.717
I got mad at myself
for being so homesick.

01:05.761 --> 01:07.415
Really?

01:07.458 --> 01:09.112
Yeah, I was there
for, like four days,

01:09.156 --> 01:10.505
and then I, uh--

01:11.854 --> 01:13.334
Hey there, whatcha doing?

01:13.377 --> 01:14.596
Don't mind me.

01:14.639 --> 01:16.946
I'm just trying on
my wedding shoes.

01:16.989 --> 01:18.643
Yeah, naturally.

01:18.687 --> 01:20.602
So many brides
try on the shoes once,

01:20.645 --> 01:21.777
and they fit, great,

01:21.820 --> 01:23.996
but you have to wear them
all day.

01:24.040 --> 01:25.607
You have to pose in them,
you have to dance in them,

01:25.650 --> 01:26.738
and if you don't break them in,

01:26.782 --> 01:29.001
you're dealing with
bride blisters.

01:29.045 --> 01:31.439
Oh, whew, bride blisters.

01:31.482 --> 01:32.570
Continue on.

01:32.614 --> 01:33.397
Act like I'm not even here.

01:33.441 --> 01:36.096
Okay.

01:37.749 --> 01:40.274
Uh... so, you were homesick?

01:40.317 --> 01:41.449
Yeah,

01:41.492 --> 01:43.538
and even though the play
went really well,

01:43.581 --> 01:45.279
I was nervous the whole time.

01:45.322 --> 01:46.236
I just...

01:47.629 --> 01:48.978
I don't know,
I just wanted to come home.

01:49.021 --> 01:49.892
It's weird, right?

01:49.935 --> 01:51.111
No.

01:51.154 --> 01:52.982
We're here.

01:53.025 --> 01:55.158
All right, bride,
how are those shoes doin'?

01:55.202 --> 01:56.159
Good.

01:56.203 --> 01:57.160
How do they look?

01:57.204 --> 01:58.161
Well, amazing.

01:58.205 --> 01:59.423
Phenomenal.

01:59.467 --> 02:00.859
The question, though,

02:00.903 --> 02:02.122
is...

02:02.165 --> 02:03.732
can you dance in them?

02:05.516 --> 02:06.561
-Oh!
-Whoa!

02:06.604 --> 02:08.432
-Can she!
-Look at that!

02:08.476 --> 02:10.826
-Ooh!
-Cha-cha-cha!

02:10.869 --> 02:12.088
Wait, is that dancing,

02:12.132 --> 02:13.045
or are you trying
to kick a door down there?

02:14.221 --> 02:15.352
Okay, you know what,

02:15.396 --> 02:17.180
get it all out now,

02:17.224 --> 02:18.747
because on my wedding day,

02:18.790 --> 02:20.792
you have to be nice to me
all day!

02:20.836 --> 02:22.359
-Oh.
-Understood.

02:22.403 --> 02:23.230
And I mean it.

02:23.273 --> 02:24.666
Not just a little bit,

02:24.709 --> 02:26.711
the whole 24 hours,
both of you.

02:26.755 --> 02:27.973
Of course!

02:28.017 --> 02:29.627
We're always so nice to you.

02:29.671 --> 02:32.195
Yeah, except when you dance.

02:32.239 --> 02:34.241
-Oh!

02:34.284 --> 02:35.981
Can you bring wine?

03:41.046 --> 03:43.440

03:43.484 --> 03:44.441
Grandpa made breakfast.

03:44.485 --> 03:45.573
All by himself.

03:45.616 --> 03:47.792
I'm a grandpa
of many talents.

03:47.836 --> 03:49.316
You know, when I was little,
Grandpa used pancakes,

03:49.359 --> 03:51.274
and he used blueberries

03:51.318 --> 03:53.276
for eyes, and a nose,
and a smile.

03:53.320 --> 03:54.973
Oh, that's what
it's supposed to be!

03:55.017 --> 03:57.019
I thought it was a ghost.

03:57.062 --> 03:58.281
A smiling ghost.

03:58.325 --> 04:00.283
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

04:00.327 --> 04:01.589
Good morning, family.

04:01.632 --> 04:02.590
Morning.

04:02.633 --> 04:03.504
Ooh, pancakes!

04:03.547 --> 04:04.896
Grandpa made them.

04:04.940 --> 04:07.377
You still do the smiley faces.

04:07.421 --> 04:08.465
See? She knew what it was!

04:08.509 --> 04:10.728
Well, I need coffee first.

04:10.772 --> 04:11.903
I'm still on London time,

04:11.947 --> 04:13.165
and I don't know
if it's morning

04:13.209 --> 04:14.341
or the middle of the night.

04:14.384 --> 04:16.865
I am exhausted and wired
at the same time.

04:16.908 --> 04:19.911
Abby, I need my blue sweater,
with the pearl buttons.

04:19.955 --> 04:21.435
You mean my blue sweater?
You can borrow it.

04:21.478 --> 04:23.828
We'll agree
to disagree on that.

04:23.872 --> 04:26.266
I am having lunch with the Pecks
before they go home,

04:26.309 --> 04:28.311
and I need to look Peck-ish.

04:28.355 --> 04:29.486
Are they still
trying to convince you

04:29.530 --> 04:30.835
to have a European wedding?

04:30.879 --> 04:32.968
No, they've given up on that.

04:33.011 --> 04:34.709
I didn't think Dennis Peck
was the kind of man

04:34.752 --> 04:35.927
who'd give up on anything.

04:35.971 --> 04:38.016
Well, David put his foot down.

04:38.060 --> 04:39.061
He's a Peck, too.

04:39.104 --> 04:40.236
Girls, if you're done,

04:40.280 --> 04:42.238
time to go get ready for school.

04:43.544 --> 04:45.546
Thanks for
the Grandpa Cakes, Grandpa.

04:45.589 --> 04:46.938
You're welcome.

04:46.982 --> 04:47.722
Have a good one, ladies.

04:47.765 --> 04:49.637
Thank you!

04:49.680 --> 04:52.030
I have a problem.

04:52.074 --> 04:55.686
The Pecks left this in my room.

04:55.730 --> 04:56.557
What is that?

04:56.600 --> 04:57.775
It's a prenup.

04:57.819 --> 04:59.603
Ooh, that's what I thought.

04:59.647 --> 05:01.170
Did you tell David?

05:01.213 --> 05:02.824
No, he'd go ballistic.

05:02.867 --> 05:04.347
Well, are you gonna tell David?

05:04.391 --> 05:06.044
I could,

05:06.088 --> 05:08.960
or I could just ignore it,
and hope the problem goes away.

05:09.004 --> 05:11.049
-Does that ever work?
-Sometimes.

05:11.093 --> 05:13.051
And these are for you,
Bree O'Brien.

05:13.095 --> 05:14.270
Thank you.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.403
What are you doing up so early?

05:16.446 --> 05:17.752
I have that meeting
at the university

05:17.795 --> 05:18.709
for the teaching gig.

05:18.753 --> 05:20.232
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:20.276 --> 05:21.625
Bree, I think you'd be
a terrific teacher.

05:21.669 --> 05:22.887
We'll see.

05:22.931 --> 05:24.411
The head of the department

05:24.454 --> 05:26.195
has already moved
my breakfast meeting

05:26.238 --> 05:27.544
to the afternoon,

05:27.588 --> 05:30.068
which is so like him.

05:30.112 --> 05:31.374
Already messing with my head.

05:31.418 --> 05:32.723
You know him?

05:32.767 --> 05:34.203
Oh, I know him.

05:34.246 --> 05:35.726
Jerome Trask.

05:35.770 --> 05:36.988
Bree's high-school nemesis.

05:37.032 --> 05:39.513
Wasn't he president
of the Debate Club?

05:39.556 --> 05:42.690
Yeah, how...
You remember Jerome Trask?

05:42.733 --> 05:45.257
You always remember people
who weren't nice to your kids.

05:46.911 --> 05:48.130
Thanks, Dad.

05:48.173 --> 05:49.566
You're very welcome, sweetheart.

05:49.610 --> 05:51.568
Well, I'm gonna
get ready for work.

05:51.612 --> 05:54.266
My new partner
is a real taskmaster.

05:54.310 --> 05:55.398
Oh, that's interesting.

05:55.442 --> 05:57.182
My new partner
is exactly the same.

05:57.226 --> 05:58.836
Not true! Not true.

06:01.143 --> 06:02.492
All right, guys,

06:02.536 --> 06:03.493
make sure you sign up
for "Clean The Beach Day!"

06:03.537 --> 06:04.494
Turtles can't save themselves.

06:04.538 --> 06:06.757
They don't have hands.

06:06.801 --> 06:10.108
Oh, good morning,
Caitlyn and Carrie Winters.

06:10.152 --> 06:11.327
Good morning, Mr. Ross.

06:11.371 --> 06:12.850
All right, girls,

06:12.894 --> 06:14.374
I want to see you back here
right at 4:00 for taekwondo.

06:15.940 --> 06:17.246
Nice.

06:17.289 --> 06:18.421
Love you. Bye.

06:18.465 --> 06:20.815
And good morning,
Abby O'Brien-Winters.

06:20.858 --> 06:22.643
Good morning, Mr. Ross.

06:22.686 --> 06:24.427
You know, I, uh, sure hope

06:24.471 --> 06:25.646
I get to spend the day with you
and the girls

06:25.689 --> 06:26.951
on the beach tomorrow.

06:26.995 --> 06:29.911
Jay, I just,
I don't think it's a good idea.

06:29.954 --> 06:31.260
Breathe.

06:31.303 --> 06:33.305
It's a school activity,
not a date.

06:33.349 --> 06:35.046
"Clean The Beach Day"?

06:35.090 --> 06:36.265
Right.

06:36.308 --> 06:38.006
I forgot.

06:38.049 --> 06:41.575
But if you are hinting

06:41.618 --> 06:43.185
that you want me to ask you out
on a date...

06:47.798 --> 06:49.017
Saved by the bell.

06:50.061 --> 06:51.193
Bye.

06:52.760 --> 06:53.717
Bye.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.599
So, you and your sisters

07:05.642 --> 07:07.427
are really going to sign up
for the Triathlon?

07:07.470 --> 07:08.340
I think so.

07:08.384 --> 07:09.603
Whew.

07:09.646 --> 07:11.039
Impressive...

07:12.519 --> 07:14.608
and I think that your mother
just might sign up, too.

07:14.651 --> 07:16.218
Do it.

07:16.261 --> 07:18.263
Ah, O'Brien
overachievers, right?

07:18.307 --> 07:19.264
Mm-hmm.

07:19.308 --> 07:20.135
Fist bump.

07:23.660 --> 07:25.009
How you doing, honey?

07:25.053 --> 07:26.446
Good.

07:27.664 --> 07:29.971
No, I'm... I'm great, actually.

07:30.014 --> 07:31.059
Never better.

07:31.102 --> 07:32.582
-Great.
-Mm-hmm.

07:33.931 --> 07:36.586
Well, I'm gonna
get us some coffee.

07:44.812 --> 07:46.204
<i>I'm happy to do that,
but are you sure?</i>

07:46.248 --> 07:48.250
I'm sure.

07:48.293 --> 07:49.947
Sure of what?

07:49.991 --> 07:52.341
Trace is--

07:52.384 --> 07:53.560
I'm selling my half
of The Bridge

07:53.603 --> 07:54.691
back to your dad.

07:56.388 --> 07:57.346
You are?

07:58.695 --> 08:00.044
I'm leaving Chesapeake Shores.

08:00.088 --> 08:02.960
I'll let you two talk.

08:05.833 --> 08:07.574
You don't
have to do that, Trace.

08:07.617 --> 08:09.358
No, I have to do it.

08:10.577 --> 08:12.709
I need something new.

08:12.753 --> 08:14.015
Somewhere new.

08:14.058 --> 08:16.539
Please don't do this
on account of me.

08:17.932 --> 08:20.978
I was staying here
on account of you.

08:21.022 --> 08:25.287
Everything in this place
reminds me of you.

08:25.330 --> 08:28.333
Look, I'm sorry for the things
I said the other day.

08:28.377 --> 08:30.335
Don't be.

08:30.379 --> 08:32.512
They needed to be said.

08:32.555 --> 08:34.339
They did,

08:34.383 --> 08:36.516
but you were right.

08:36.559 --> 08:40.955
I've been chasing ghosts.

08:40.998 --> 08:42.478
I need a fresh start.

08:43.479 --> 08:44.393
Where?

08:45.786 --> 08:47.744
I'll figure it out.

08:50.051 --> 08:51.531
Take care of yourself, Abby.

08:58.146 --> 09:00.104
Here you go.

09:00.148 --> 09:01.279
Thanks.

09:03.064 --> 09:05.545
Ah, you've gotta love caffeine.

09:09.157 --> 09:11.289
It's okay
if it takes a while.

09:12.900 --> 09:14.423
What?

09:14.466 --> 09:17.557
Being better.

09:21.952 --> 09:24.607
We need eggplant
for my Parmigiana.

09:26.653 --> 09:28.306
Your parents seem to have
accepted the idea

09:28.350 --> 09:29.438
of us having the wedding here.

09:29.481 --> 09:31.571
Mm-hmm. "Seem to."

09:31.614 --> 09:33.355
Emphasis on the "seem."

09:34.661 --> 09:36.488
I'll be so glad
when my parents leave

09:36.532 --> 09:37.968
after lunch,

09:38.012 --> 09:41.145
to just get back to you and me.

09:41.189 --> 09:43.234
Yes.

09:43.278 --> 09:46.629
I had a nice long chat
with your mother.

09:46.673 --> 09:47.674
Oh, really?

09:47.717 --> 09:49.066
That's good.

09:49.110 --> 09:50.198
Or is it?

09:50.241 --> 09:52.417
Oh, yeah, she, uh...

09:52.461 --> 09:54.768
she's excited
about me joining the family.

09:54.811 --> 09:56.508
Well, if you run out
of things to talk about

09:56.552 --> 09:57.553
with my mother,

09:57.597 --> 09:59.207
just ask her about herself.

09:59.250 --> 10:00.077
It's her favorite subject.

10:00.121 --> 10:01.165
Perfect.

10:01.209 --> 10:02.514
I can do that.

10:02.558 --> 10:05.387
Or could ask her
about her Lalique collection.

10:05.430 --> 10:06.867
She'll talk for hours and hours.

10:08.042 --> 10:09.086
Got it.

10:09.130 --> 10:12.133
Sorry, what did she ask you?

10:12.176 --> 10:13.482
She...

10:13.525 --> 10:16.528
asked me to...

10:16.572 --> 10:17.834
take really good care of you.

10:17.878 --> 10:19.140
Really?

10:19.183 --> 10:20.663
Mm-hmm.

10:20.707 --> 10:22.099
Well, that's nice.

10:31.848 --> 10:32.806
Hey, Abby.

10:32.849 --> 10:35.896
Hey!

10:35.939 --> 10:38.246
What's a Lalique?

10:38.289 --> 10:39.508
-Pardon?
-I'm doomed.

10:39.551 --> 10:41.292
David's mother collects them,

10:41.336 --> 10:42.816
and I have no idea
what they are.

10:42.859 --> 10:45.732
Well, have you tried asking
Siri, or Alexa, or Google?

10:45.775 --> 10:47.690
No, I was hoping
a human could help me.

10:47.734 --> 10:50.345
-You're so old-school.
-Aw...

10:50.388 --> 10:51.781
How's it going with Dad?

10:51.825 --> 10:55.219
Actually, it's going
pretty well, surprisingly.

10:55.263 --> 10:56.699
You know, it was
a bit bumpy at first,

10:56.743 --> 10:57.700
but when you take someone
who's stubborn

10:57.744 --> 10:58.788
and strong-willed

10:58.832 --> 11:00.007
and won't take no
for an answer--

11:00.050 --> 11:01.530
And put her together
with Dad...

11:01.573 --> 11:03.097
That's very good,
you're very funny.

11:03.140 --> 11:04.968
I see what you did there.

11:05.012 --> 11:07.318
Yeah, I mean,
we bump heads a lot,

11:07.362 --> 11:09.103
but I think it's good
for both of us.

11:09.146 --> 11:10.626
It gets us
out of our comfort zones.

11:10.670 --> 11:13.020
I like my comfort zone.

11:13.063 --> 11:14.238
It's comfy.

11:15.457 --> 11:16.414
All right, well,

11:16.458 --> 11:18.895
I gotta go to work...

11:18.939 --> 11:20.070
with Dad!

11:21.245 --> 11:23.117
And I gotta find out
what a Lalique is.

11:26.598 --> 11:27.817
I'm just saying

11:27.861 --> 11:29.514
that, maybe, now
is not a good time

11:29.558 --> 11:31.081
to proceed with the project.

11:31.125 --> 11:32.126
Right, but you just had me
cost out the new floor plans

11:32.169 --> 11:33.301
last week.

11:33.344 --> 11:34.258
I know, but...

11:34.302 --> 11:35.607
So, what changed?

11:35.651 --> 11:37.740
Just, the economy, and...

11:37.784 --> 11:39.437
Look, I know you met
with Quigley's.

11:39.481 --> 11:41.048
So you're going with
another contractor.

11:41.091 --> 11:42.702
Why?

11:42.745 --> 11:44.529
I've known Mick for years--

11:44.573 --> 11:47.445
So it's the Dilpher business.

11:47.489 --> 11:48.969
It's just...

11:49.012 --> 11:50.622
now isn't the right time.

12:03.853 --> 12:05.246
I just wanted to take
one more look at this beauty

12:05.289 --> 12:06.987
before we go.

12:07.030 --> 12:08.597
Everything is so...

12:08.640 --> 12:10.947
"Rockwellian" I think
is the word you're looking for.

12:10.991 --> 12:14.255
I was thinking
more Andrew Wyethian.

12:14.298 --> 12:16.605
Okay, flight's in an hour.
I'll get the bags.

12:16.648 --> 12:17.693
I will help you.

12:20.043 --> 12:21.001
Should we help them?

12:21.044 --> 12:22.698
No, they've got it.

12:22.742 --> 12:25.092
We have a wedding to plan.

12:25.135 --> 12:26.180
Yes, we do.

12:26.223 --> 12:28.791
Right here
in Chesapeake Shores.

12:28.835 --> 12:30.184
Do you mind?

12:31.359 --> 12:34.231
Actually, I'm... I'm relieved.

12:36.016 --> 12:38.670
Did you have a chance to look
at that paperwork I left you?

12:38.714 --> 12:40.411
I have.

12:40.455 --> 12:42.370
It basically just says

12:42.413 --> 12:44.241
that you're joining
the Peck family,

12:44.285 --> 12:46.809
that you're under
our protective umbrella.

12:46.853 --> 12:48.289
Yes.

12:48.332 --> 12:49.507
Ahem.

12:49.551 --> 12:51.945
David said you collect
Lalique crystal.

12:51.988 --> 12:53.468
Yes, I do.

12:53.511 --> 12:54.425
Are you a devotee?

12:54.469 --> 12:55.600
I am.

12:55.644 --> 12:57.820
Lalique was founded in 1888,

12:57.864 --> 12:58.995
and has endured

12:59.039 --> 13:01.171
as the ultimate symbol
of French luxury.

13:02.346 --> 13:03.521
That's well put.

13:05.001 --> 13:05.828
Car's all packed!

13:10.833 --> 13:12.835
I left a little something
in your room.

13:14.097 --> 13:15.838
More paperwork?

13:15.882 --> 13:18.623
Um, call it, um...

13:18.667 --> 13:20.190
a surprise.

13:44.388 --> 13:46.303
So I just had that meeting
with Taylor Martin...

13:46.347 --> 13:47.391
Yeah?

13:47.435 --> 13:50.307
...and, uh, well,

13:50.351 --> 13:51.700
he's going with another firm.

13:51.743 --> 13:52.962
What?

13:53.006 --> 13:54.268
Why?

13:54.311 --> 13:55.399
The Dilpher thing.

13:58.098 --> 14:00.187
That is the third job
we've lost in a month.

14:00.230 --> 14:01.884
Yeah, I know,

14:01.928 --> 14:05.801
and that is why I think
that we need to branch out.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.629
Okay, I think that we should buy

14:07.672 --> 14:09.544
a small concrete supplier,

14:09.587 --> 14:11.502
or maybe take a stake
in a roofing company--

14:11.546 --> 14:12.852
Now is not the time to expand.

14:12.895 --> 14:14.854
Dad, in today's market,

14:14.897 --> 14:16.246
builders who diversify

14:16.290 --> 14:18.509
have a better chance
of growing their bottom--

14:18.553 --> 14:20.685
Look, honey, even with
the projects we've lost,

14:20.729 --> 14:23.079
we still have a lot
on our plate.

14:23.123 --> 14:25.647
We have the Chang high-rise
in Alexandria,

14:25.690 --> 14:26.909
we have the Kincaid
project here.

14:26.953 --> 14:27.823
We're doing fine.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.216
I agree with you.

14:29.259 --> 14:32.088
Look, I know
how hard you've worked,

14:32.132 --> 14:35.483
but you have to continue
building the business,

14:35.526 --> 14:36.571
no matter what happens.

14:36.614 --> 14:37.833
All right, look,

14:37.877 --> 14:39.748
we have to go look
at that job site,

14:39.791 --> 14:41.489
so why don't we talk about it
on the way, all right?

14:41.532 --> 14:42.925
-Okay.
-All right.

14:45.275 --> 14:47.234
We will figure this out.

14:51.629 --> 14:54.763
Oh, and, uh, I've got
something to show you.

14:54.806 --> 14:56.721
New nameplate.

14:59.899 --> 15:01.291
-President?
-Mm-hmm.

15:01.335 --> 15:02.466
When did you have this made?

15:02.510 --> 15:04.555
A few years ago.

15:04.599 --> 15:06.470
You knew I was gonna
come work with you?

15:06.514 --> 15:08.124
No, I didn't know,

15:08.168 --> 15:09.821
but I hoped.

15:17.873 --> 15:20.180
So you're saying
the interior wall is here?

15:20.223 --> 15:21.268
That's right.

15:21.311 --> 15:22.965
Now I get it.

15:25.620 --> 15:27.665
Hey, guys.

15:27.709 --> 15:29.058
You know my daughter, Abby.

15:29.102 --> 15:30.842
She's my new partner.

15:30.886 --> 15:32.061
-Of course.
-Hi, Abby.

15:32.105 --> 15:34.324
She's got some great ideas
for the company.

15:34.368 --> 15:35.456
Isn't that terrific.

15:35.499 --> 15:36.370
You must be so proud.

15:38.589 --> 15:41.114
Could we talk to you
in private?

15:41.157 --> 15:42.506
I'm gonna go check
on the Bobcat.

15:42.550 --> 15:43.551
Uh, yeah, I'll go with him--

15:43.594 --> 15:44.900
No, no, stay here.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.032
Anything you want to say,

15:46.075 --> 15:46.989
you can say
in front of my partner.

15:47.033 --> 15:49.078
Well, we've heard a few things,

15:49.122 --> 15:51.646
and we have a few concerns.

15:51.689 --> 15:53.561
I would like
to talk to you privately...

15:53.604 --> 15:54.910
about the Dilpher thing.

15:54.954 --> 15:57.521
Would you now?

15:57.565 --> 16:00.394
Alex Johnson and Cole Larson.

16:00.437 --> 16:02.352
Those are names
that I've heard forever.

16:02.396 --> 16:03.527
You guys have done
a lot of business with us

16:03.571 --> 16:04.485
over the years.

16:04.528 --> 16:05.921
Yes, we have.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.750
There's the condo project
in Alexandria,

16:08.793 --> 16:10.621
and the apartment complex
in Bethesda?

16:10.665 --> 16:11.709
And lots of others.

16:11.753 --> 16:14.016
That's right,

16:14.060 --> 16:15.800
and have you ever had
any problems?

16:15.844 --> 16:19.413
Have you ever had complaints
about construction,

16:19.456 --> 16:21.806
or lost any money?

16:21.850 --> 16:23.895
Has there ever been a question

16:23.939 --> 16:25.941
whether O'Brien Construction
and Development

16:25.985 --> 16:28.813
has built anything below
the highest possible standards?

16:28.857 --> 16:29.901
No, but--

16:29.945 --> 16:31.729
And I seem to remember

16:31.773 --> 16:34.167
my father took a chance on you
when you were just starting out.

16:34.210 --> 16:35.298
He believed in you

16:35.342 --> 16:36.212
before you believed
in yourselves.

16:36.256 --> 16:37.257
He did.

16:37.300 --> 16:39.172
He did that deal

16:39.215 --> 16:40.738
with a handshake
and a look in the eye.

16:40.782 --> 16:43.089
Yeah.

16:43.132 --> 16:44.220
Can't you do the same
for him now?

16:46.483 --> 16:48.529
This is our business, Mick.

16:48.572 --> 16:50.835
It's all we have.

16:50.879 --> 16:51.967
We just can't take the chance.

17:03.109 --> 17:05.154
That was a great speech, Abby.

17:05.198 --> 17:07.243
It didn't change their minds.

17:07.287 --> 17:08.462
No,

17:08.505 --> 17:10.420
but it sure felt good
to hear it.

17:15.034 --> 17:16.557
Hey, Luke.

17:16.600 --> 17:18.602
Hey.

17:27.307 --> 17:28.830
That'll be all?

17:28.873 --> 17:30.440
-Yeah, thanks.
-Yeah.

17:32.399 --> 17:35.880
But listen,
you know The Bridge, right?

17:35.924 --> 17:37.012
Mm-hmm.

17:37.056 --> 17:38.622
Yeah, well, my dad runs it now,

17:38.666 --> 17:41.538
and... he's looking for help.

17:41.582 --> 17:43.236
-He is?

17:43.279 --> 17:44.628
Yeah.

17:44.672 --> 17:46.021
So I was just wondering

17:46.065 --> 17:47.457
if maybe you might be interested
in working there?

17:48.719 --> 17:50.678
Oh, well, thanks,

17:50.721 --> 17:51.766
but as you can see,

17:51.809 --> 17:53.333
my career is really
taking off here.

17:54.725 --> 17:56.205
Yeah.

17:56.249 --> 17:58.164
Yeah, no, I know
that you have a job, but--

17:58.207 --> 18:00.601
Look, I appreciate
the offer, O'Brien,

18:00.644 --> 18:02.646
but I'm not looking
for charity.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.650
Here's the change.

18:12.265 --> 18:13.266
All right,
see you around, Luke.

18:13.309 --> 18:15.920
Yeah.

18:23.928 --> 18:25.060
-Hey, Dad.
-Hey, honey.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.018
Spring cleaning?

18:27.062 --> 18:30.021
Yeah, London taught me
about all my fashion faux-pas,

18:30.065 --> 18:32.415
so I'm dropping it off
at the donation bin.

18:32.459 --> 18:33.895
Oh...

18:33.938 --> 18:36.811
Well, that's always
a good thing.

18:36.854 --> 18:39.335
Hey, have you decided
about that teaching position

18:39.379 --> 18:40.293
at the university?

18:40.336 --> 18:41.816
I haven't yet.

18:41.859 --> 18:43.209
I still have to meet with
the head of the department.

18:43.252 --> 18:44.819
Oh, Jerome Trask,

18:44.862 --> 18:46.429
your sophomore enemy.

18:46.473 --> 18:47.952
Nemesis.

18:49.606 --> 18:50.912
Helen Sturges
was my sophomore enemy.

18:50.955 --> 18:52.261
Ah.

18:53.654 --> 18:54.524
I know I shouldn't worry
about this stuff.

18:54.568 --> 18:55.786
It was high school,

18:55.830 --> 18:57.701
it was, like,
a million years ago, but...

18:57.745 --> 18:59.007
ah, Jerome Trask,

18:59.050 --> 19:03.272
he just always
made me feel "less than."

19:03.316 --> 19:04.317
"Less-than"?

19:04.360 --> 19:05.361
Yeah, like...

19:05.405 --> 19:06.884
like a bookworm.

19:06.928 --> 19:08.364
A geek.

19:08.408 --> 19:09.974
I thought you were proud
of being a bookworm-geek.

19:10.018 --> 19:12.934
I was, but on my own
bookworm-geeky terms.

19:12.977 --> 19:14.892
Why didn't you
talk to me about this?

19:16.329 --> 19:17.547
I did.

19:17.591 --> 19:19.375
No, no, you joked about it,

19:19.419 --> 19:22.770
but I didn't know
it hurt you.

19:22.813 --> 19:23.988
If I'd known
you were having problems--

19:24.032 --> 19:25.033
Well, I didn't
want you to know.

19:25.076 --> 19:25.816
Why not?

19:27.253 --> 19:29.994
Well, because...

19:30.038 --> 19:32.214
I don't know, you were
always so proud of me

19:32.258 --> 19:33.433
when I came home
with straight As on my papers,

19:33.476 --> 19:35.870
and I, uh,

19:35.913 --> 19:39.830
I didn't want you to know
I was struggling.

19:39.874 --> 19:41.310
Anyway, you had
so much going on

19:41.354 --> 19:43.356
with Mom leaving,
and your business, and...

19:43.399 --> 19:46.272
Look, honey, I know I wasn't
always there for you,

19:46.315 --> 19:48.883
and I'm sorry about that,

19:48.926 --> 19:51.102
but straight As
or no straight As,

19:51.146 --> 19:53.714
you've always been
my bright-shining girl.

19:53.757 --> 19:54.628
I love you.

19:56.369 --> 19:58.371
Thanks, Dad.

19:58.414 --> 19:59.372
Okay.

20:30.664 --> 20:31.578
Luke?

20:33.449 --> 20:34.407
Luke Tatum?

20:34.450 --> 20:36.147
Yeah?

20:36.191 --> 20:38.062
Bree O'Brien.

20:38.106 --> 20:40.064
Oh.

20:40.108 --> 20:41.283
-Hey. How you doing?
-Hi.

20:41.327 --> 20:43.329
Oh, I'm fine now.

20:43.372 --> 20:45.069
Now?

20:45.113 --> 20:48.072
Yeah, after I got over
my heartbreak.

20:48.116 --> 20:49.596
Your what?

20:49.639 --> 20:51.380
Oh, you really
don't remember me.

20:51.424 --> 20:52.686
I'm, uh,

20:52.729 --> 20:54.905
I'm Kevin O'Brien's
little sister?

20:54.949 --> 20:56.559
Oh, wow.

20:56.603 --> 20:58.213
No, I did not recognize you.

20:58.257 --> 20:59.301
Yeah, I know,

20:59.345 --> 21:01.172
the braces add 10 pounds.

21:01.216 --> 21:03.479
Um, I had a little crush on you,

21:03.523 --> 21:05.133
but you obviously didn't know
that I existed.

21:05.176 --> 21:08.049
Well, I didn't know
a lot of things.

21:08.092 --> 21:09.920
You seem to have
recovered nicely.

21:09.964 --> 21:13.881
Yeah, we O'Briens
are a resilient bunch.

21:13.924 --> 21:16.318
Did you move back?

21:16.362 --> 21:18.015
For now, yeah.

21:18.059 --> 21:19.800
Welcome home.

21:19.843 --> 21:21.367
Thanks.

21:21.410 --> 21:23.107
What are you doing
these days?

21:23.151 --> 21:26.720
Oh, just a little this
and a little of that.

21:28.199 --> 21:31.986
Actually, uh, your--

21:32.029 --> 21:34.293
someone offered me
a job this morning,

21:34.336 --> 21:36.382
but I don't know
if I'll take it.

21:36.425 --> 21:38.209
Well, I'm a firm believer

21:38.253 --> 21:39.733
that sometimes change
is a good thing

21:39.776 --> 21:40.864
Sometimes?

21:40.908 --> 21:42.301
Yeah, sometimes, it's not.

21:45.608 --> 21:47.610
Maybe you're right.

21:47.654 --> 21:49.264
Maybe I'll look into it.

21:49.308 --> 21:51.092
Well, I'm glad I could help.

21:52.876 --> 21:54.225
"In three words,

21:54.269 --> 21:57.054
I can sum up everything

21:57.098 --> 21:58.839
It goes on."

21:58.882 --> 22:00.884
Robert Frost.

22:00.928 --> 22:02.712
That's right.

22:04.497 --> 22:05.715
Cool.

22:07.848 --> 22:10.416
-So nice to see you.
-Yeah.

22:10.459 --> 22:11.852
Uh, I'll see you around.

22:11.895 --> 22:12.766
See you.

22:44.363 --> 22:45.668
Hi.

22:45.712 --> 22:47.235
Jess, what are you doing here?

22:47.278 --> 22:48.758
I'm a good aunt.

22:48.802 --> 22:50.369
I came to see my nieces
learn to kick things.

22:53.067 --> 22:54.764
-They're good.
-They are.

22:54.808 --> 22:56.940
I like to think
they get it from me.

22:56.984 --> 22:58.725
I took karate in college.

22:58.768 --> 23:00.248
You did?

23:00.291 --> 23:01.945
Yes.
It was my little secret.

23:01.989 --> 23:02.946
I thought I was pretty tough.

23:02.990 --> 23:04.208
Did you have a black belt?

23:04.252 --> 23:07.124
No, I stopped at orange.

23:07.168 --> 23:08.299
They have orange?

23:08.343 --> 23:09.213
Yes.

23:10.301 --> 23:11.390
Orange is nice.

23:18.005 --> 23:19.354
Jess, why are you here?

23:19.398 --> 23:20.224
Did you talk to David
about the prenup?

23:20.268 --> 23:21.530
I couldn't.

23:21.574 --> 23:23.140
She sweetened the deal.

23:27.014 --> 23:27.928
What is that?

23:27.971 --> 23:29.973
Mrs. Peck...

23:30.017 --> 23:32.846
Deidre left it in my room.

23:32.889 --> 23:35.718
-Is this real?
-I hope not.

23:35.762 --> 23:36.937
Why do you think she left it?

23:36.980 --> 23:38.939
Well, it's obviously a bribe.

23:38.982 --> 23:40.244
Yeah.

23:40.288 --> 23:41.289
It's a pretty good bribe,
though, right?

23:41.332 --> 23:42.508
Uh, yes.

23:57.131 --> 24:01.352
The legendary Bree O'Brien.

24:04.051 --> 24:05.835
Uh, I guess.

24:05.879 --> 24:08.229
Hello, Jerome.

24:08.272 --> 24:09.709
Oh, it's just Jerry now.

24:09.752 --> 24:11.188
Ah.

24:11.232 --> 24:12.712
I'm sure you're probably
sick of hearing this,

24:12.755 --> 24:14.148
but I loved your book.

24:14.191 --> 24:15.932
No.

24:15.976 --> 24:18.152
I never get sick
of hearing that.

24:18.195 --> 24:20.546
I also saw your play
in Baltimore,

24:20.589 --> 24:22.939
and it made me cry.

24:24.375 --> 24:25.768
-Oh.
-Yeah.

24:25.812 --> 24:26.769
Thank you.

24:26.813 --> 24:28.510
Why don't I show you around?

24:28.554 --> 24:29.903
Sure.

24:29.946 --> 24:31.992
Um...

24:32.035 --> 24:35.822
you have done
such amazing things

24:35.865 --> 24:37.127
with your life, Bree,

24:37.171 --> 24:38.607
and I think there's so much

24:38.651 --> 24:40.217
that you could teach
our grad students,

24:40.261 --> 24:41.480
if you'd be willing.

24:42.568 --> 24:43.917
Sure.

24:43.960 --> 24:44.831
Yeah, we could talk about that.

24:44.874 --> 24:45.788
Good.

24:45.832 --> 24:47.007
Great.

24:47.050 --> 24:48.356
Uh, to be honest,

24:48.399 --> 24:50.532
I wasn't sure
if you would come today.

24:50.576 --> 24:52.055
Why not?

24:52.099 --> 24:53.404
Oh, well, you know,

24:53.448 --> 24:55.363
we didn't exactly
get along in high school.

24:55.406 --> 24:57.408
We did not.

24:57.452 --> 25:00.150
I didn't take it personally,
mind you.

25:00.194 --> 25:01.978
I'm sorry, you didn't...

25:02.022 --> 25:03.806
you didn't take it personally?

25:03.850 --> 25:06.505
Well, that you didn't like me.

25:06.548 --> 25:08.028
I mean, I wasn't very likable
in high school...

25:08.071 --> 25:11.422
Um, I didn't like you because
you didn't like me first.

25:11.466 --> 25:12.554
-What?
-Yeah.

25:12.598 --> 25:14.077
No.

25:14.121 --> 25:17.037
I... I just had a hard time
getting to know people

25:17.080 --> 25:18.342
in high school,

25:18.386 --> 25:23.522
and you were so smart,
and, uh...

25:24.392 --> 25:25.262
And?

25:25.306 --> 25:27.526
Just and.

25:29.092 --> 25:30.267
You were out of my league,
as they say.

25:31.878 --> 25:34.141
I wasn't in anybody's league.

25:34.184 --> 25:36.230
-Oh, you don't think so?
-No.

25:37.536 --> 25:39.668
No, I just wanted to be
accepted on my own terms.

25:39.712 --> 25:41.801
Yeah, I guess high school's

25:41.844 --> 25:42.976
not really the best place
for that, huh?

25:43.019 --> 25:44.238
That is true.

25:45.587 --> 25:47.763
Can I ask you
one little thing, though?

25:49.069 --> 25:50.897
Why I didn't pick you
for the debate team?

25:50.940 --> 25:52.376
Yeah.

25:52.420 --> 25:55.989
Well... it's because

25:56.032 --> 25:57.294
I knew you were
better than I was.

25:59.775 --> 26:01.603
Like I said,

26:01.647 --> 26:03.387
I wasn't very likable
in high school.

26:04.475 --> 26:06.434
Hmm...

26:06.477 --> 26:07.522
And now?

26:09.306 --> 26:10.394
I'm trying.

26:12.353 --> 26:13.572
Okay.

26:13.615 --> 26:14.790
Let me show you the library.

26:14.834 --> 26:15.791
Sure.

26:15.835 --> 26:17.445
It's very nice.

26:19.012 --> 26:20.187
Yeah, no.

26:34.941 --> 26:37.073
Uh, wait, so Trace
is leaving town?

26:37.117 --> 26:38.074
Why didn't he tell anybody?

26:38.118 --> 26:39.249
He told me.

26:39.293 --> 26:40.816
-He told me.
-I knew about it.

26:40.860 --> 26:41.948
Even I knew.

26:41.991 --> 26:43.950
Did you know?

26:43.993 --> 26:45.734
I did not know.

26:45.778 --> 26:47.388
Okay, wait,
so he was just going to leave

26:47.431 --> 26:48.519
and not say goodbye?

26:48.563 --> 26:50.304
That was the plan,

26:50.347 --> 26:52.045
till the O'Briens showed up
and spoiled everything.

26:52.088 --> 26:53.873
We have that way about us.

26:53.916 --> 26:54.743
That's true.

26:54.787 --> 26:56.397
It's not just us, Trace.

26:56.440 --> 26:57.572
I mean, look,

26:57.616 --> 26:58.660
everyone came out
to see you off.

26:58.704 --> 27:01.184
Come join us
for a farewell toast.

27:01.228 --> 27:02.969
Maybe in a little bit.

27:03.012 --> 27:04.666
You mean a lot
to a lot of people, Trace.

27:04.710 --> 27:05.624
You should know that.

27:07.364 --> 27:09.149
Hey, why don't I
get us another round

27:09.192 --> 27:10.324
on the house.

27:10.367 --> 27:11.978
Trace, will you give me a hand?

27:12.021 --> 27:13.240
-Yeah.
-Thanks.

27:15.808 --> 27:17.461
Seven beers
on the house, please?

27:17.505 --> 27:19.028
You really
don't have to do this, Mick.

27:19.072 --> 27:21.988
No, I want to, I want to.

27:22.031 --> 27:24.294
You know, I know
there's always been a...

27:24.338 --> 27:26.035
barrier between us,

27:26.079 --> 27:27.907
and maybe that's my fault.

27:27.950 --> 27:30.736
Fathers and daughters,
you know,

27:30.779 --> 27:33.086
but I've always respected you.

27:33.129 --> 27:36.002
Same here.

27:36.045 --> 27:39.396
You know, there are times
in a person's life

27:39.440 --> 27:42.486
when everything seems
to just stop,

27:42.530 --> 27:45.446
and every road is a dead end,

27:45.489 --> 27:47.317
but there's always
another path,

27:47.361 --> 27:50.886
and I know
that you'll find yours.

27:50.930 --> 27:53.846
Thanks...

27:53.889 --> 27:54.803
Thanks, Mick.

27:55.761 --> 27:56.805
Welcome.

27:56.849 --> 27:58.154
Let's get those drinks,

27:58.198 --> 27:59.286
so we can make
that toast to you.

27:59.329 --> 28:00.896
Yeah, um...
give me a sec.

28:00.940 --> 28:01.897
I'll be right back.

28:01.941 --> 28:03.507
Well, hurry up,

28:03.551 --> 28:06.685
because I don't want to forget
my incredibly clever toast.

28:12.038 --> 28:14.780
The place is not gonna be
the same without Trace.

28:14.823 --> 28:17.217
These wings could be better.

28:17.260 --> 28:18.740
Maybe the new manager
will bring you on

28:18.784 --> 28:19.654
as a consultant.

28:19.698 --> 28:21.743
He could do worse.

28:21.787 --> 28:23.789
Drinks are on the way.

28:23.832 --> 28:25.051
Where did Trace go?

28:25.094 --> 28:26.226
Oh, he'll be right back.

28:26.269 --> 28:28.097
No, he won't be back.

28:28.141 --> 28:29.490
What do you mean?

28:29.533 --> 28:32.885
He doesn't like goodbyes.

28:47.377 --> 28:48.944
Hey.
Hey.

28:48.988 --> 28:49.815
Mind if I join you?

28:49.858 --> 28:52.078
Not at all.

28:59.259 --> 29:02.131
You know, this was
my favorite time of day.

29:02.175 --> 29:03.872
You guys were little,

29:03.916 --> 29:05.308
and safely tucked in bed,

29:05.352 --> 29:06.788
and I'd come down here,

29:06.832 --> 29:08.703
and look at the stars.

29:08.747 --> 29:10.966
Mm, and have a glass of wine.

29:11.010 --> 29:13.360
Hey, I needed one
after putting you guys to bed.

29:13.403 --> 29:14.448
Were we much trouble?

29:14.491 --> 29:16.798
Good trouble.

29:16.842 --> 29:19.192
But you were the worst.

29:19.235 --> 29:21.324
"Tell me another story,

29:21.368 --> 29:23.109
get me a drink of water,

29:23.152 --> 29:24.806
tell me how the universe runs."

29:24.850 --> 29:26.634
To which you always said,

29:26.677 --> 29:27.809
"hard work and love."

29:27.853 --> 29:29.115
I did?

29:29.158 --> 29:30.203
Mm-hmm.

29:30.246 --> 29:31.291
I was a pretty smart dad.

29:31.334 --> 29:34.250
Eh... yeah, yeah.

29:35.208 --> 29:38.211
You were.

29:38.254 --> 29:41.605
But I worked too hard,
didn't I?

29:41.649 --> 29:43.303
I wasn't always
there for you, was I?

29:43.346 --> 29:46.219
No,

29:46.262 --> 29:48.134
but now that I'm a parent,

29:48.177 --> 29:49.962
I know that nothing
is ever perfect.

29:50.005 --> 29:53.661
and you lose some,
you win a lot.

29:53.704 --> 29:55.141
It all balances out.

29:55.184 --> 29:57.230
I hope so.

30:03.671 --> 30:06.805
Do you want to talk about it?

30:08.807 --> 30:09.895
Do I have to?

30:09.938 --> 30:13.681
Not if you don't want to.

30:13.724 --> 30:15.988
I'm just... sad.

30:17.641 --> 30:21.036
But I'm okay.

30:21.080 --> 30:24.518
I mean, actually,
I'm better than okay.

30:24.561 --> 30:27.651
I'm excited to see
what comes next.

30:29.523 --> 30:30.480
That's a good feeling.

30:30.524 --> 30:31.481
Mm-hmm.

30:31.525 --> 30:32.656
It is.

30:32.700 --> 30:35.398
Hey, do you remember
the one thing

30:35.442 --> 30:36.965
that always put me to sleep?

30:37.009 --> 30:38.227
Oh, the secret weapon.

30:38.271 --> 30:40.012
Mm-hmm.

Another beautiful day

31:48.863 --> 31:51.083
David, I have to talk to you
about something

31:51.126 --> 31:52.388
What is it?

31:55.435 --> 31:56.566
I think it was
a really good idea

31:56.610 --> 31:58.133
getting these chickens.

31:58.177 --> 31:59.656
People love the farm-fresh eggs.

31:59.700 --> 32:00.701
Thank you.

32:00.744 --> 32:01.441
You know, I've named them.

32:02.833 --> 32:04.618
Who are those two?

32:04.661 --> 32:06.794
That's Original
and that's Crispy.

32:06.837 --> 32:08.839
Stop.

32:08.883 --> 32:10.276
I am sorry.

32:10.319 --> 32:12.191
He's normally
a very nice person.

32:12.234 --> 32:14.149
Then I guess you don't want
to meet Orange and Teriyaki.

32:14.193 --> 32:15.194
Stop!

32:17.022 --> 32:19.111
Now I'm hungry.

32:20.982 --> 32:22.984
Mom, look,
it's so clear.

32:23.028 --> 32:24.246
Oh, it's beautiful.

32:24.290 --> 32:26.379
You've got to put that
in your collection.

32:26.422 --> 32:27.467
It's nice to see
you and the girls

32:27.510 --> 32:29.077
pitching in
to clean up the beach.

32:29.121 --> 32:31.079
Of course.
It's a worthy cause.

32:31.123 --> 32:33.516
Yeah, we've all
got to do our part.

32:33.560 --> 32:34.517
We're happy to be here.

32:34.561 --> 32:35.475
Me too.

32:35.518 --> 32:38.521
So... how are you?

32:39.914 --> 32:41.437
Good.

32:41.481 --> 32:44.005
Hey, Jay...

32:44.049 --> 32:45.920
Thanks for being
such a good friend.

32:47.269 --> 32:49.271
Yeah, you're worth it.

32:49.315 --> 32:50.098
Mr. Ross!

32:50.142 --> 32:51.012
Hey, yeah.

32:51.056 --> 32:52.057
Look what I found.

32:52.100 --> 32:53.101
-Oh.
-What is it?

32:53.145 --> 32:55.625
It's a shark's tooth.

32:55.669 --> 32:56.800
You know, they replace them
constantly,

32:56.844 --> 32:58.889
so they're always
growing new ones.

32:58.933 --> 33:03.459
This one looks like it belongs
to a sand tiger shark.

33:03.503 --> 33:05.070
They swim around here, right?

33:05.113 --> 33:06.332
Yeah, sometimes,

33:06.375 --> 33:07.333
but they never attack people.

33:07.376 --> 33:08.987
I wish I could see one.

33:09.030 --> 33:13.034
Well, maybe you will, one day.

33:13.078 --> 33:15.384
There are two things
I'm good at dealing with,

33:15.428 --> 33:16.864
kids and sharks.

33:16.907 --> 33:19.388
Ah, I will remember that.

33:24.915 --> 33:27.092
And another
"Clean The Beach Day,"

33:27.135 --> 33:28.789
and the O'Briens
did their part.

33:28.832 --> 33:29.964
That's what we do.

33:30.008 --> 33:31.444
You remember
that "Clean the Beach Day"

33:31.487 --> 33:33.185
when Jess got so sunburnt?

33:33.228 --> 33:34.925
Oh, honey, you looked like
a little lobster for a week.

33:34.969 --> 33:37.058
How can I forget?

33:37.102 --> 33:38.581
We never forgot
the sunscreen after that.

33:38.625 --> 33:39.626
Nope, sure didn't.

33:39.669 --> 33:41.541
I met with my nemesis
yesterday.

33:41.584 --> 33:42.585
Did you now?

33:42.629 --> 33:43.499
-Mm-hmm.
-And?

33:43.543 --> 33:45.675
Not so bad.

33:45.719 --> 33:47.025
I think I'm gonna
take the job.

33:47.068 --> 33:48.809
It's just teaching
grad students,

33:48.852 --> 33:50.898
and it's for one semester,
so...

33:50.941 --> 33:51.768
That's great, Bree.

33:51.812 --> 33:54.554
And totally unexpected.

33:54.597 --> 33:56.947
I think I have to rethink
all of my high-school years.

33:56.991 --> 33:58.384
It's, um...

33:58.427 --> 34:00.560
I just wonder what else
I might have gotten wrong.

34:00.603 --> 34:02.083
With age comes wisdom.

34:02.127 --> 34:02.997
Mm-hmm.

34:05.695 --> 34:07.045
So, he was cute, huh?

34:07.088 --> 34:08.350
He was cute?

34:08.394 --> 34:10.439
Oh, no, he wasn't cute.

34:10.483 --> 34:11.223
What are you talking about?

34:11.266 --> 34:12.093
He was not cute.

34:12.137 --> 34:13.877
What? Cute? No.

34:13.921 --> 34:14.835
Okay.

34:14.878 --> 34:16.445
Whatever you say.

34:16.489 --> 34:18.839
-He was so cute.
-He was so cute.

34:31.939 --> 34:33.027
-Great job!
-Well done!

34:33.071 --> 34:34.550
Well done!

34:34.594 --> 34:36.639
Wow...

34:36.683 --> 34:38.424
I have to tell you something.

34:38.467 --> 34:39.512
Do you?

34:39.555 --> 34:41.035
I wanted to tell you earlier,

34:41.079 --> 34:43.168
but I didn't know
how you'd feel,

34:43.211 --> 34:45.605
and then I decided

34:45.648 --> 34:49.261
that even when things
become difficult,

34:49.304 --> 34:50.914
I don't want to keep
anything from you.

34:50.958 --> 34:52.177
This sounds serious.

34:54.048 --> 34:58.270
Your mother asked me to sign
a prenuptial agreement.

34:58.313 --> 34:59.532
Did she?

35:01.360 --> 35:03.405
She said it was to protect me,

35:03.449 --> 35:05.146
but the more I think about it,

35:05.190 --> 35:06.582
I think it was maybe
to protect--

35:06.626 --> 35:07.453
Them.

35:07.496 --> 35:08.541
Right.

35:08.584 --> 35:10.934
This is typical
of my parents,

35:10.978 --> 35:12.588
and why should you sign
a prenup?

35:12.632 --> 35:14.590
If anything,
you should sign one.

35:14.634 --> 35:16.766
When I met you,
you were a fry cook,

35:16.810 --> 35:18.594
and I owned
a thriving business.

35:18.638 --> 35:20.596
Well, not that thriving.

35:20.640 --> 35:22.163
You didn't pay me
for a few months there.

35:22.207 --> 35:23.817
Okay, well, you were
on the ground floor

35:23.860 --> 35:26.080
of what would become
a thriving business.

35:26.124 --> 35:27.647
Ah, yes, true, true, true.

35:27.690 --> 35:29.344
So, what should I do?

35:29.388 --> 35:30.650
Should I sign it?

35:30.693 --> 35:32.042
It's too late.

35:32.086 --> 35:34.175
I already burned it.

35:34.219 --> 35:35.307
What?

35:36.525 --> 35:37.613
You knew about it?

35:37.657 --> 35:39.180
Mm-hmm.
I found it this afternoon

35:39.224 --> 35:42.009
under a stack of towels
in the laundry room.

35:42.052 --> 35:43.706
I'm sorry.
I...

35:43.750 --> 35:46.666
I should have told you.

35:46.709 --> 35:50.887
I am never going to keep
anything from you ever again.

35:52.846 --> 35:54.630
She also gave me a bracelet.

35:54.674 --> 35:56.763
I think it was a bribe.

35:56.806 --> 35:58.547
It's clearly not real,

35:58.591 --> 36:00.070
or it would have come
with armed guards.

36:00.114 --> 36:01.463
What did you do with it?

36:01.507 --> 36:03.291
Uh, I don't even know.

36:03.335 --> 36:05.728
The car, in the glove
compartment, I think?

36:05.772 --> 36:07.295
I don't even
want to think about it.

36:07.339 --> 36:09.210
It was my Aunt Carol's.

36:09.254 --> 36:11.517
She and Mom
wanted you to have it...

36:11.560 --> 36:12.561
That's nice.

36:13.910 --> 36:15.042
...and it is real.

36:15.085 --> 36:16.565
What?

36:16.609 --> 36:17.914
What!

36:17.958 --> 36:19.394
What?

36:22.223 --> 36:23.224
What?

36:23.268 --> 36:25.357
That's my girl.

36:25.400 --> 36:26.271
Mm.

36:26.314 --> 36:28.969
Hey, Dad...

36:29.012 --> 36:30.449
when did you know

36:30.492 --> 36:32.929
that I was gonna
come work with you?

36:32.973 --> 36:34.757
You told me
when you were six years old.

36:34.801 --> 36:36.237
What?

36:36.281 --> 36:38.544
Mm-hmm, you told me
we were going to be partners.

36:38.587 --> 36:40.285
You even had
business cards made up.

36:40.328 --> 36:42.025
Abby and Daddy O'Brien.

36:43.375 --> 36:45.115
I guess I was prophetic.

36:45.159 --> 36:46.900
You also told me

36:46.943 --> 36:48.206
you were going to be
President of the United States.

36:48.249 --> 36:50.512
Well, I got it half right.

39:07.083 --> 39:09.390
Can I join you?

39:09.434 --> 39:12.654
Got your name on it.

39:19.574 --> 39:22.751
Hey, um...

39:22.795 --> 39:24.231
how long did it take you

39:24.274 --> 39:26.364
to get over
your break-up with Georgia?

39:28.757 --> 39:30.498
A while, sis.

39:32.152 --> 39:35.024
A long while.

39:36.286 --> 39:37.418
You're strong.

39:37.462 --> 39:38.506
I know.

39:40.639 --> 39:43.119
I mean it.

39:43.163 --> 39:44.991
You know, it's never easy
ending things.

39:45.034 --> 39:48.429
No, it isn't.

39:59.266 --> 40:00.702
So you were just
going to leave

40:00.746 --> 40:01.747
without saying goodbye?

40:07.492 --> 40:09.189
What haven't we already
said to each other

40:09.232 --> 40:10.495
over the years?

40:10.538 --> 40:13.715
I don't think
we've ever said goodbye.

40:15.891 --> 40:17.980
That's true.

40:20.766 --> 40:23.464
Where are you going, Trace?

40:23.508 --> 40:26.249
I don't know,

40:26.293 --> 40:27.816
but I think
there's something missing

40:27.860 --> 40:30.297
inside of me.

40:30.340 --> 40:31.907
I tried to find it in my music.

40:31.951 --> 40:34.823
I tried to find it in us.

40:34.867 --> 40:38.305
Now I'm going to try
to find it in myself.

40:40.438 --> 40:42.309
I wish you luck.

40:42.352 --> 40:43.615
Kiss the girls for me.

40:45.094 --> 40:46.661
They're going to miss you.

40:46.705 --> 40:48.489
I'm gonna miss them...

40:50.404 --> 40:52.493
...and you.

40:59.152 --> 41:02.416
You deserve the best, Abby.

41:02.460 --> 41:03.461
You know that.

41:05.550 --> 41:06.725
So do you.

41:08.378 --> 41:10.990
Maybe now we'll find it.

41:51.770 --> 41:53.075
I'm going to tell you
what Gran told me

41:53.119 --> 41:55.600
after my break-up.

41:55.643 --> 41:56.862
"You can never heal

41:56.905 --> 41:58.646
by going back
to what broke you."

42:02.824 --> 42:03.956
That's sound advice.

42:03.999 --> 42:07.002
You know the Irish,

42:07.046 --> 42:10.919
we have a good cry,
make a joke, walk it off.

42:13.618 --> 42:15.576
I wish I was
a little more Irish.

42:15.620 --> 42:18.231
Don't we all?
