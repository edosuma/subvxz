Crystal Cove needed a trendy

05:51.264 --> 05:52.531
Ok! I do.

05:57.771 --> 05:59.872

a humongonaut,

07:04.520 --> 07:08.557
you need to talk to Jax Minner,
your insurance specialist!

like a team again.

wow when we have problems.

07:28.745 --> 07:31.346

we hire a doctor or
somebody else with authority

07:33.750 --> 07:35.350
to help us work things out.

07:35.418 --> 07:37.586

G... g...
Oh. That's me.

09:39.175 --> 09:41.276
Man up and make up your mind.

09:41.344 --> 09:43.612
Is it going to be me or Scooby?

09:43.679 --> 09:45.947
Yeah, me or Velma?

09:46.015 --> 09:48.617
I'll be ok
with whatever you decide,

09:48.684 --> 09:51.520
but don't you doubt for a second
that the whole school will know

09:51.587 --> 09:53.855
that you picked a dumb dog
over a real girl.

09:53.923 --> 09:55.824

I just might have another solution.

10:03.433 --> 10:05.100
You see, the way I'm looking at it,

10:05.168 --> 10:07.769
we need a group identity...
a name.

10:07.837 --> 10:10.439
I suggest we honor those
that came before us.

10:10.506 --> 10:13.942

And to go with our new name,

money from all their destruction.

That's right, girlie.

sound guilty,

11:04.660 --> 11:06.328
I don't know what does.

11:06.395 --> 11:08.763
It appears we have our suspect.

Uh, I'm still here, you know.

11:11.567 --> 11:13.401
Oh! Sorry.

11:25.114 --> 11:28.049
Ok, gang, remember...
Our goal is to go in,

11:28.117 --> 11:31.219
find proof that Rusty Gnales is
behind the humongonaut attacks,

11:31.287 --> 11:32.954
and then, get out.

11:38.127 --> 11:39.728
Both: Huh?

11:39.795 --> 11:41.630
- Hmmph!
- Oh!

11:43.633 --> 11:45.800
[Groans]

11:48.304 --> 11:49.604
Both: Hmmph!

11:51.807 --> 11:54.409
[Grunts and groans]

11:57.580 --> 11:59.548
Both: Hmmph!

11:59.615 --> 12:00.882
Whoa!

12:00.950 --> 12:03.785
Look, Scooby-Doo,
I know that we're fighting,

12:03.853 --> 12:07.789
but this no-eye-contact thingy
is getting a bit dangerous.

12:07.857 --> 12:09.624
Oh, ok.

12:09.692 --> 12:11.626
One eye, but no more.

12:11.694 --> 12:13.862
[Roaring]

12:16.365 --> 12:18.033
- Zoinks!
- Aah!

12:19.302 --> 12:20.569
Look out, gang!

12:20.636 --> 12:22.804
- [Roaring]
- [All scream]

12:26.509 --> 12:28.009
Aah!

12:29.478 --> 12:31.413
[Roars]

12:31.480 --> 12:34.416
[Grunting]

12:34.483 --> 12:36.418
[Roaring]

12:36.485 --> 12:39.654
What in plantation
is going on out here? Oh!

12:39.722 --> 12:41.756
[Roaring]

12:42.925 --> 12:44.759
[Both grunt]

12:46.429 --> 12:49.598
[Roars]

12:53.102 --> 12:56.104
- [All scream]
- Run!

12:57.206 --> 13:00.475
[All scream]

13:00.543 --> 13:03.979
Phew! Like,
that was a little too close.

13:04.046 --> 13:05.680
[Exhales]
You can say that again.

13:05.748 --> 13:07.182
- That...
- Don't.

13:07.250 --> 13:11.152
I guess this means you're not a
suspect after all, Mr. Gnales.

13:11.220 --> 13:13.722
Gee, you really think so?

13:21.287 --> 13:23.221
That didn't go very well.

13:23.289 --> 13:25.456
And now,
we don't even have a suspect.

13:25.524 --> 13:26.958
Hey, folks, need insurance?

13:27.026 --> 13:28.860
For all of your insurance needs,

13:28.928 --> 13:31.129
be a winner...
contact Max Minner,

13:31.197 --> 13:32.463
the best in the biz.

13:32.531 --> 13:35.133
[Static and stations changing]

13:35.201 --> 13:36.534
Hello!

13:36.602 --> 13:38.203
Mr. E.!

13:38.270 --> 13:39.704
Are you interested in a riddle

13:39.772 --> 13:42.207
that might help you
solve your mystery?

13:42.274 --> 13:44.842
Like, couldn't you just
give us the answer instead?

13:44.910 --> 13:47.345
It'd be a lot easier that way.

13:47.413 --> 13:51.082
[Chuckles] Now, what
would be the fun in that?

13:52.117 --> 13:55.520
To solve the mystery,
do as follows...

13:55.588 --> 13:58.856
Open your eyes
and look for the signs

13:58.924 --> 14:01.192
that are all around you.

14:01.260 --> 14:02.794
Open your ears,

14:02.861 --> 14:04.195
and you'll add

14:04.263 --> 14:05.797
to your knowledge.

14:05.864 --> 14:07.398
Open your minds,

14:07.466 --> 14:09.133
and you'll ensure

14:09.201 --> 14:11.169
a speedy solution.

14:11.237 --> 14:14.806
- Rat's rit?
- Yes, "rat's rit."

14:14.873 --> 14:16.474
Good luck.
[static]

14:16.542 --> 14:19.744
Yes, Max Minner is
your very own insurance pro.

14:19.812 --> 14:20.912
[Clicks]

14:20.980 --> 14:22.747
Does anyone have
the slightest clue

14:22.815 --> 14:24.816
of what Mr. E.
was talking about?

14:27.553 --> 14:29.387
Dad, those humongonaut things...

14:29.455 --> 14:32.223
that... that's
a trademarked name there.

14:33.225 --> 14:34.325
Remember that.

14:34.393 --> 14:37.161
Are super dangerous.
You need to do something.

14:37.229 --> 14:40.231
And something I shall do.
Isn't that right, sheriff?

14:40.299 --> 14:42.767
Right you are,
Mr. Mayor.

14:44.136 --> 14:47.238
Uh, that's for my official portrait.
Next picture.

14:49.041 --> 14:52.143
Like, dude, you're going to
make a giant bowl of salad?

14:52.211 --> 14:54.145
Cork it! Behold...

14:54.213 --> 14:56.481
Operation: Catch a humongonaut
by the toe.

14:56.548 --> 14:59.083
See, the title is based on
the old eeny-meany-miny...

14:59.151 --> 15:01.019
Yeah, we get it.
What's the plan?

15:01.086 --> 15:04.689
We fill Crystal Cove stadium
with lots of valuable loot

15:04.757 --> 15:08.226
and invite the beast there
to stomp it.

15:08.294 --> 15:11.162
- How is that going to work?
- [Laughs] Yeah!

15:11.230 --> 15:14.232
That plan's worse than something
me and Scoob would come up with.

15:14.300 --> 15:16.734
Right, buddy?
Yeah! [giggles]

15:16.802 --> 15:20.772
I mean, grr!
Hmmph!

15:20.839 --> 15:23.174
We don't have
all of the details worked out,

15:23.242 --> 15:25.109
but the important thing
to remember is

15:25.177 --> 15:28.346
all of the cash money
we'll be pulling in

15:28.414 --> 15:30.281
from selling tickets
to our trap.

15:30.349 --> 15:33.918
Trap? You mean you're
building a trap without me?

15:33.986 --> 15:36.154
My own father?
[whimpering and sniffling]

15:38.657 --> 15:40.091
How could you!

15:40.159 --> 15:41.459
Freddy!

15:41.527 --> 15:45.530
Oh, buckets of bear bait,
it's just business.

15:45.597 --> 15:48.266
You kids going
to a costume party?

15:48.334 --> 15:50.301
All: No.

15:50.369 --> 15:54.205
That's too bad,
because you all look ridiculous.

15:54.273 --> 15:56.374
[Orchestral music playing]

15:56.442 --> 15:58.209
Ladies and gentlemen,

15:58.277 --> 16:01.212
thank you for coming
to the stomping today.

16:01.280 --> 16:03.214
The management would like
to remind you

16:03.282 --> 16:04.716
that at no time are they liable

16:04.783 --> 16:07.018
for any bodily injury
that might occur

16:07.086 --> 16:10.688
from a humongonaut hurling a
high-ticket item into the stands.

16:10.756 --> 16:13.024
Enjoy the show, and please,

16:13.092 --> 16:15.493
scream responsibly.

16:16.595 --> 16:18.529
- Go big red!
- Go big green!

16:18.597 --> 16:21.199
Big red!
[growls]

16:21.266 --> 16:23.101
Like, ok, ok.

16:23.168 --> 16:25.203
That's enough of that.

16:25.270 --> 16:26.971
Although I guess
I should be happy

16:27.039 --> 16:29.540
that you're sort of
talking to each other.

16:29.608 --> 16:30.775
Hmmph!

16:30.843 --> 16:33.044
- Look at that!
- Is it a humongonaut?

16:33.112 --> 16:35.947
No, they're using 40 test
for their ledger line,

16:36.014 --> 16:38.116
but only 30 pound weights
on the jig?

16:38.183 --> 16:39.450
[Scoffs]
You got to be kidding me.

16:39.518 --> 16:41.052
These guys are amateurs.

16:41.120 --> 16:42.720
Now, that's interesting.

16:42.788 --> 16:44.122
What's interesting?

16:44.189 --> 16:46.290
When I started marking off
the site of each attack,

16:46.358 --> 16:47.792
a pattern emerged.

16:47.860 --> 16:50.461
The beasts are only attacking
certain buildings.

16:50.529 --> 16:52.630
But what do they have
in common?

16:52.698 --> 16:56.234
Like, that's as hard to figure
out as one of Mr. E.'s riddles.

16:56.301 --> 16:59.237
Shaggy, you're a genius.

16:59.304 --> 17:03.307
"Open your ears, and you'll
add to your knowledge."

17:03.375 --> 17:06.511
"Open your eyes,
and look for the signs."

17:06.578 --> 17:10.248
"Open your minds, and you'll
ensure a speedy solution."

17:10.315 --> 17:14.352
Ads. Signs. Insure.

17:15.587 --> 17:18.256
Gang, I think we're close
to solving this mystery,

17:18.323 --> 17:20.358
and it's not going
to happen here.

17:20.425 --> 17:22.627
That's a relief.
I just saw a deputy

17:22.694 --> 17:25.128
try to bait a bow net
with a sparrow.

17:25.196 --> 17:27.231
Hello, loser!

17:27.299 --> 17:30.535
Everyone knows
you're supposed to use a pigeon.

17:33.705 --> 17:35.306
Is everything set, Velma?

17:35.374 --> 17:37.909
Yes.
If all goes as planned,

17:37.976 --> 17:39.811
the humongonauts' next target
should be

17:39.878 --> 17:42.246
this old, abandoned
boat repair shop.

17:42.314 --> 17:43.915
And when they go
to attack it...

17:43.982 --> 17:45.082
- Boom!
- [Gasps]

17:45.150 --> 17:47.185
- We spring the trap!
- [Roars]

17:47.252 --> 17:49.353
Zoinks!
They're coming!

17:49.421 --> 17:52.056
- [Grunts]
- [All gasp]

17:53.492 --> 17:56.093
Come on, gang.
Let's hide.

17:56.161 --> 17:58.830

18:32.865 --> 18:35.199
[Humongonauts roaring
and grunting]

18:46.512 --> 18:49.614
Come on, big green!
Go get 'em!

18:49.681 --> 18:52.149
Go big red!
Go big red!

18:52.217 --> 18:54.886
[Both growling and grunting]

[All gasp and scream]

[Grunting and roaring]

19:06.331 --> 19:07.765
Hit it, Fred!

19:11.737 --> 19:13.938
One of your traps
actually worked!

19:14.006 --> 19:16.707
You don't have to act
so darn surprised about it.

19:16.775 --> 19:18.843
[Siren]

19:18.911 --> 19:20.678
[Indistinct chatter
over police radio]

19:20.746 --> 19:22.880
So they didn't show!
I don't see why

19:22.948 --> 19:25.283
we couldn't just seize
the ticket money as evidence.

19:25.350 --> 19:29.620
Prancing piccolos, Fred.
One of your traps actually worked!

19:29.688 --> 19:33.190
Greetings,
big and hairy space travelers.

19:33.258 --> 19:37.628
As a representative of
planet earth, I welcome you.

19:37.696 --> 19:40.965
I'm afraid these two
aren't space travelers, sheriff.

19:41.033 --> 19:45.102
I'd like to introduce
Max Minner and Jax Minner.

19:46.972 --> 19:48.639
It's the Minner brothers?

19:48.707 --> 19:53.010
They've been taking care of all of Crystal
Cove's insurance needs for years.

19:53.078 --> 19:55.079
But how did you know
they'd both show up here?

19:55.147 --> 19:57.081
All I did was double insure
the boat repair shop

19:57.149 --> 19:59.083
with a policy
from both brothers.

19:59.151 --> 20:01.252
You see, each brother
was only attacking the places

20:01.320 --> 20:02.753
the other brother insured.

20:02.821 --> 20:05.156
- But why?
- Why do you think? Money.

20:05.223 --> 20:07.592
And the fact that
we can't stand each other.

20:07.659 --> 20:08.926
Oh, yeah. That, too.

20:08.994 --> 20:10.928
This intense dislike started

20:10.996 --> 20:12.930
back when we were
circus strongmen.

20:12.998 --> 20:15.099
[Crowd cheering]

20:18.337 --> 20:21.238
We had just come up
with a great idea for our act,

20:21.306 --> 20:23.074
the Hercules apes...

20:23.141 --> 20:24.842
Humongonauts is catchier.

20:24.910 --> 20:27.178
When this jerk decides
to break up our act

20:27.245 --> 20:29.013
and join a rival circus.

20:29.081 --> 20:30.848
Huh! You were just jealous.

20:30.916 --> 20:34.185
We became bitter enemies
who, as chance would have it,

20:34.252 --> 20:37.755
both went into the insurance
business here in Crystal Cove.

20:39.558 --> 20:42.026
[Roars]

20:42.094 --> 20:45.262
After that, we each focused
on the same thing...

20:45.330 --> 20:48.132
Destroying
each other's business.

20:49.935 --> 20:52.603
And it would have worked, too,
if it weren't for...

20:52.671 --> 20:54.171
Max and Jax:
My meddling brother!

20:54.239 --> 20:55.940
What? Why, you...

20:56.008 --> 20:58.275
[grunting]

20:58.343 --> 20:59.877
Mystery solved.

20:59.945 --> 21:02.279
I'd just like to take
this opportunity to point out

21:04.983 --> 21:06.283
that the gang seems to be working
as a team again. Go us!

21:06.351 --> 21:08.352
It's teamwork
that makes a team a team,

21:08.420 --> 21:10.855
not that other junk.
Like uniforms?

21:10.922 --> 21:13.791
Uh, um...
I guess so.

21:13.859 --> 21:16.427
But the uniforms didn't hurt,
right, team?

21:20.499 --> 21:22.767
Oh, man.
All right.

21:22.834 --> 21:24.902
Maybe the new name is enough.

21:24.970 --> 21:26.504
Well, we may have solved
the mystery,

21:26.571 --> 21:29.907
but there's still one more question
that needs to be answered.

21:29.975 --> 21:31.208
Right, Scooby?

21:31.276 --> 21:32.977
That's right, Relma.

21:33.045 --> 21:37.148
Like, um...
Ooh, what...

21:37.215 --> 21:38.816
question would that be?

21:38.884 --> 21:41.152
Come on, Shaggy.
Make up your mind...

21:41.219 --> 21:43.921
Me or Scooby?

21:43.989 --> 21:45.823
[Gulps]

21:47.159 --> 21:47.992
Um...

21:48.060 --> 21:50.194
Like, it's a blue humongonaut!

Run for your lives!

21:52.931 --> 21:54.131
- Shaggy!
- Raggy!

21:54.199 --> 21:55.800
Can't talk now!
