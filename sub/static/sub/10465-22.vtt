All right.

40:06.100 --> 40:09.634
 <i>* But I don't know</i>
 <i>If I can last too long *</i>

40:09.634 --> 40:11.501
[SIGHS]

40:11.501 --> 40:13.200
I can do this.

40:14.601 --> 40:16.834
Okay.

40:16.834 --> 40:19.133
 <i>* And please don't *</i>

40:19.133 --> 40:22.834
 <i>* Make me hate you *</i>

40:29.100 --> 40:31.367
Why don't you call him?

40:31.367 --> 40:34.100
JULIA:
Maybe he wants to apologize?

40:34.100 --> 40:35.601
For what?

40:35.601 --> 40:38.734
For being the same way
he always is to me?

40:38.734 --> 40:41.133
You can't blame
the major for that.

40:43.701 --> 40:45.133
I'm-- I'm the jerk here

40:45.133 --> 40:47.601
for thinkin' things
were gonna be different.

40:48.968 --> 40:51.934
This isn't your fault, Griffin.

40:53.334 --> 40:54.934
I got...

40:57.334 --> 40:59.834
Had this, uh, friend
on the ship.

40:59.834 --> 41:03.400
Uh, his name was, uh, Ziggy,

41:03.400 --> 41:05.601
like the cartoon character.

41:05.601 --> 41:09.167
He had this big round head, uh,
so we called him, uh...

41:09.167 --> 41:12.067
Anyway, one day we were

41:12.067 --> 41:14.167
having a beer, you know,
we'd been out there

41:14.167 --> 41:16.367
for a couple of months.

41:16.367 --> 41:18.367
And Zig says, uh:

41:18.367 --> 41:21.033
"So how long's your old man
been dead?"

41:21.033 --> 41:22.601
[SCOFFS]

41:22.601 --> 41:24.501
I said, "He's not.

41:24.501 --> 41:25.801
What are you talkin' about?"

41:25.801 --> 41:27.801
He couldn't believe it.

41:27.801 --> 41:29.167
I mean,

41:29.167 --> 41:31.868
he says...

41:31.868 --> 41:35.000
He says, "Well, we work
every day together,

41:35.000 --> 41:36.634
"eat every meal.

41:36.634 --> 41:39.133
"We live in
this 2-by-nothing room,

41:39.133 --> 41:42.100
"and you've never said

41:42.100 --> 41:43.901
one word about him."

41:46.701 --> 41:48.267
He just assumed that...

41:57.100 --> 42:01.734
Sometimes, with you,
I forget.

42:01.734 --> 42:05.701
Oh, 'cause, uh...

42:05.701 --> 42:08.834
you talk about your
mom and dad so much.

42:08.834 --> 42:09.834
[***]

42:09.834 --> 42:12.801
It's like they're so...

42:12.801 --> 42:14.300
in your life.

42:17.567 --> 42:19.033
Sometimes
I have to remind myself

42:19.033 --> 42:20.601
how come I've never met them.

42:24.067 --> 42:25.000
[SIGHS]

42:27.534 --> 42:28.968
[SIGHS]

42:30.167 --> 42:33.400
I-- I am gonna spoil my kids

42:33.400 --> 42:35.434
so bad.

42:37.634 --> 42:39.067
