00:42.936 --> 00:44.353
[growling]

00:53.196 --> 00:54.530
So we were all trying to track you,

00:54.613 --> 00:56.240
but Richard, or maybe it was Botila...

00:56.324 --> 00:59.035
hacked your GPS and got us
going on a wild goose chase.

00:59.118 --> 01:00.912
These guys went all over looking for you.

01:00.995 --> 01:02.121
And you know where Richard led us?

01:02.205 --> 01:03.957
The bottom of the ocean.

01:04.040 --> 01:05.917
He sent megalodons after Lukas!

01:06.000 --> 01:07.585
Kong had to swim down and punch them out.

01:07.669 --> 01:08.712
And then you know what happened?

01:08.795 --> 01:10.629
We almost walked straight
into the hands of the...

01:10.714 --> 01:12.256
[laughing] Whoa, motormouth!

01:12.340 --> 01:14.550
How about letting your sister
get a word in?

01:14.633 --> 01:16.094
[beeping]

01:17.846 --> 01:21.432
[groans] We should have guessed
they'd put a tracking device on Amy.

01:23.559 --> 01:24.894
[grunting]

01:27.146 --> 01:28.647
[whispering] Keep talking, Danny.

01:28.732 --> 01:32.193
[loudly] Tell Amy how
Kong KO'd Richard's bots.

01:32.276 --> 01:34.028
[softly] Our security scanner
detected a bug.

01:39.242 --> 01:41.035
Uh, yeah... right.

01:41.119 --> 01:44.205
[loudly] Uh, he... totally nailed T-Rex.

01:44.288 --> 01:45.581
Um...

01:45.664 --> 01:49.878
Oh, and then Kong sneezed
all over Richard! [giggles]

01:49.961 --> 01:52.588
[Danny] Kong totally covered him in snot.
It was awesome!

01:52.671 --> 01:55.800
[laughs]
Don't say anything, Amy.

01:55.884 --> 01:57.343
It's probably a listening device too.

01:57.426 --> 01:59.262
[softly]
How are we going to get rid of it?

01:59.345 --> 02:01.931
We're not.
Just Richard with any luck.

02:03.599 --> 02:05.143
[grunting]

02:05.226 --> 02:07.520
Easy, bro, we're heading home.

02:07.603 --> 02:09.604
[grunting]

02:09.687 --> 02:11.775
Yes, Kong. Trust me.

02:11.858 --> 02:14.193
[grunting]

02:14.277 --> 02:15.862
Jonesy, take us home.

02:15.945 --> 02:17.947
And why don't the rest of us
get some shut-eye?

02:18.031 --> 02:19.866
It's gonna be a long ride.

02:27.706 --> 02:29.042
[grunting]

02:34.255 --> 02:36.465
[screeching]

02:36.549 --> 02:39.052
The pterodactyls have their signal.

02:39.135 --> 02:40.178
Perfect.

02:40.261 --> 02:42.221
But don't let them get too close.

02:42.305 --> 02:45.683
I want to be sure Lukas
finally leads us to his hideout.

02:45.767 --> 02:47.936
Let me know the minute
you have the coordinates.

02:48.019 --> 02:52.065
Meanwhile, I'll be attending
to our other pressing matter.

02:53.066 --> 02:54.943
[birds squawking]

02:55.026 --> 02:56.694
[all chittering]

03:15.463 --> 03:17.340
[both roaring]

03:25.306 --> 03:26.891
[both screaming]

03:30.811 --> 03:33.439
[Richard] There, there.
You're safe now.

03:33.522 --> 03:37.693
I promise to make sure nothing ever
tries to harm you again.

03:40.488 --> 03:41.530
Yeah!

03:41.614 --> 03:44.075
- [applause]
- [Richard] <i>Mere words cannot express</i>

03:44.158 --> 03:47.245
<i>the profound joy I felt
when my bionobots and I</i>

03:47.328 --> 03:51.374
saved these noble creatures
from those ruthless poachers.

03:51.457 --> 03:55.003
It is lucky we were there.
Poaching is such a problem.

03:55.086 --> 04:00.174
It inspired me to reopen
the Remy Natural History and Marine Park.

04:00.258 --> 04:02.343
- [applause]
- [crowd cheering]

04:02.426 --> 04:05.471
I am proud to rebuild the dream...

04:05.554 --> 04:06.680
my father...

04:06.764 --> 04:09.017
Dr. Leo Remy, had begun.

04:09.100 --> 04:12.061
Which my brother and his
savage beast destroyed.

04:12.145 --> 04:17.358
This is only the first of many sanctuaries
I plan to create around the world.

04:20.694 --> 04:22.821
- [applause]
- [crowd cheering]

04:26.284 --> 04:27.493
[chittering]

04:27.576 --> 04:31.039
And, as a memento of their visit
to my new diorama...

04:31.122 --> 04:36.794
every child will get a toy monkey...
to remind them how precious nature is.

04:38.296 --> 04:39.630
[blowing raspberry]

04:39.713 --> 04:41.465
[laughs] You got that right, Kong.

04:41.549 --> 04:43.384
[grunting]

04:43.467 --> 04:47.889
Huh. I wish my brother really wanted
to keep Dad's dream alive...

04:47.972 --> 04:50.433
but we all know Richard hates nature.

04:50.516 --> 04:53.686
Totally. So what do you think
he's really up to, Lukas?

04:53.769 --> 04:54.979
No idea, Danny...

04:55.063 --> 04:58.191
but I do know that, sadly, there are
very few monkeys left in the world.

04:58.274 --> 05:01.069
And the last place they'd be safe
is with Richard.

05:01.152 --> 05:03.112
So we need to get them off the island.

05:03.196 --> 05:04.906
[grunting]

05:04.989 --> 05:07.116
Too bad Jonesy and Amy
took the helicopter.

05:07.200 --> 05:09.743
Yeah, but I wonder
where they are now?

05:09.827 --> 05:12.371
I received a holo-text from Jonesy
about an hour ago...

05:12.455 --> 05:16.709
<i>They should be over mainland China.</i>
[chuckling]

05:17.460 --> 05:21.005
<i>Jonesy said he'll make sure
to find another carrier for the device</i>

05:21.089 --> 05:23.174
<i>before they head
to visit your grandmother.</i>

05:23.257 --> 05:25.593
[Danny] <i>Jonesy is gonna flip
when he tastes Gram's cooking.</i>

05:26.260 --> 05:27.971
[grunting with pleasure]

05:28.054 --> 05:30.639
It's so amazing,
he may not wanna come home!

05:33.226 --> 05:36.687
Uh, but then Jonesy loves
Anita's cooking even more!

05:36.770 --> 05:38.897
So, Lukas, how're we
gonna save these monkeys?

05:38.982 --> 05:41.067
Right. First we have to find out
how many there are

05:41.150 --> 05:42.485
and where Richard's keeping them.

05:42.568 --> 05:44.362
Easy. We just sneak in.

05:44.445 --> 05:48.532
Eh, it's too risky. This handsome mug
is not only famous, it's infamous.

05:48.616 --> 05:50.618
[grunting]

05:50.701 --> 05:53.371
And unfortunately,
Kong's invisibility cloak

05:53.454 --> 05:54.955
only lasts a few minutes.

05:55.039 --> 05:57.291
[gasps] Panchi and I can go undercover.

05:57.375 --> 05:59.377
Right! Incognito!

05:59.460 --> 06:02.046
Can you help us make disguises,
<i>tía</i> Anita?

06:02.588 --> 06:06.925
<i>Sí,</i> when I am <i>finito,</i>
no one will recognize you two.

06:13.474 --> 06:16.894
Good job, Anita.
No one is gonna recognize Panchi.

06:16.977 --> 06:19.938
What about...
[laughing] Danny?

06:20.023 --> 06:22.733
[laughing]

06:23.776 --> 06:26.945
Hey! It's not like we have
a costume store around here.

06:27.030 --> 06:29.282
[giggling]

06:29.365 --> 06:33.702
It's perfect.
No one will ever recognize you, Danny.

06:33.786 --> 06:35.621
[Kong grunting]

06:38.332 --> 06:42.545
[laughs] Kong must want to come along,
so he made a disguise, too.

06:42.628 --> 06:47.050
[laughs] Nice try, dude, but you look
like a giant ape wearing a tree.

06:47.133 --> 06:50.344
Aw, sorry, buddy.
You have to hang here with Anita and me.

06:50.428 --> 06:52.805
[groaning]

06:52.888 --> 06:54.473
[children shouting]

07:01.397 --> 07:03.816
This place looks super real.

07:03.899 --> 07:05.984
Huh. Feels real, too.

07:06.069 --> 07:08.737
And that looks just like Chatter.

07:08.821 --> 07:10.531
Hi there, pretty bird!

07:10.614 --> 07:13.576
Huh. My senses aren't
picking up anything.

07:13.659 --> 07:15.786
It's gotta be one of Richard's robots.

07:17.080 --> 07:19.957
- Danny!
- Robot. Relax.

07:20.583 --> 07:21.625
Security cam!

07:21.709 --> 07:24.670
[Panchi] Ooh.
They're probably all over the place.

07:24.753 --> 07:27.548
- [chittering]
- [Danny] More robots.

07:27.631 --> 07:29.258
This stinks!

07:29.342 --> 07:32.761
All the animals in this diorama
are just Richard's bionophonies.

07:34.888 --> 07:36.724
Uh, maybe not.

07:36.807 --> 07:40.728
Argh! Huh.
Two can play that game.

07:42.563 --> 07:45.066
Okay, that's enough
monkeying around. [chuckles]

07:45.149 --> 07:48.361
[scoffs] You got that right.
This guy's the real deal.

07:48.444 --> 07:51.989
Hi. I'm Danny, this is Panchi.

07:52.073 --> 07:57.161
We're gonna get you out of here,
'cause trust me... this place is bad news.

07:57.245 --> 07:58.287
[chittering]

07:58.371 --> 08:01.332
He says he and his sister
are the only real monkeys.

08:01.415 --> 08:03.834
[grunts] Stop! I'm in disguise.

08:03.917 --> 08:05.336
And here comes trouble!

08:05.419 --> 08:08.131
[Danny gasps] Police Commissioner Decker!

08:09.548 --> 08:11.509
[sighs heavily]

08:11.592 --> 08:13.427
Why haven't they called in?

08:13.511 --> 08:17.223
You know, I'm starting to understand
how hard it is for you to sit and wait.

08:17.306 --> 08:19.016
[grunting in agreement]

08:20.684 --> 08:22.520
[sighing with relief] We're okay.

08:22.603 --> 08:25.939
Decker didn't recognize us.
But who are those guys with him?

08:26.023 --> 08:29.235
Judging by all the medals,
they've got to be generals...

08:29.318 --> 08:31.654
or something more important.

08:31.737 --> 08:33.280
What's more important than a general?

08:33.364 --> 08:34.532
- [chittering]
- [laughing]

08:34.615 --> 08:38.285
Yeah, bananas are pretty important.

08:40.288 --> 08:44.250
Sorry, little guy, but it's not safe for
us to be seen talking to you right now.

08:44.333 --> 08:46.210
We gotta go.

08:46.294 --> 08:50.047
But I promise we'll be back for you
as soon as we can. I swear.

08:50.131 --> 08:52.966
Come on! Let's go
find out what's going on.

08:53.050 --> 08:54.885
Just act natural.

08:54.968 --> 08:59.473
Well, General Berk!
I don't usually see you off the base.

08:59.557 --> 09:03.561
My daughter was incredibly excited
to see some real animals.

09:03.644 --> 09:06.897
Daddy! Daddy!
Look what Dr. Remy gave me!

09:06.980 --> 09:09.775
[laughing] Isn't that nice, honey.

09:09.858 --> 09:12.110
Oh, Dr. Remy. Good to see ya.

09:12.195 --> 09:15.198
General Berk, so glad you could make it.

09:15.281 --> 09:18.742
Thank you for the invitation
and this delightful toy.

09:18.826 --> 09:23.038
[Richard] Just seeing the smiles
on the children's faces is thanks enough.

09:23.121 --> 09:26.250
Walk away. No sudden movements.

09:26.334 --> 09:27.918
You two! Hold it!

09:30.921 --> 09:32.423
[gulps]

09:32.506 --> 09:34.383
Who? Us? [clears throat]

09:34.467 --> 09:36.385
[deepening voice] Who? Us?

09:36.469 --> 09:39.680
Now, Richard...
These kids didn't get a toy monkey.

09:41.182 --> 09:43.517
Oh! Thank you, Mister.

09:43.601 --> 09:46.270
That's Dr. Remy.

09:46.354 --> 09:47.938
[clearing throat]

09:48.021 --> 09:51.234
Well, gotta go.
Our mom's waiting for us.

09:52.651 --> 09:55.196
[Danny in high-pitched voice]
Bye! Thank you!

09:58.241 --> 10:00.158
[Kong grunting happily]

10:01.118 --> 10:03.996
I thought Richard was
going to recognize us for sure.

10:04.079 --> 10:06.123
That was way too close.

10:06.207 --> 10:09.252
At least now we know there's only
two real monkeys in the whole place.

10:09.335 --> 10:11.462
But... what does Richard want with them?

10:11.545 --> 10:12.963
I don't know, Danny.

10:13.046 --> 10:15.674
Could be he wants
to turn them into bionobots,

10:15.758 --> 10:18.010
or just use them to promote the park.

10:18.093 --> 10:20.178
Either way, we've gotta
get them out of there.

10:21.222 --> 10:23.056
[exclaims]

10:25.058 --> 10:29.522
Oh, and Richard invited a whole
bunch of high-ranking military officers.

10:29.605 --> 10:31.649
Yeah, even a couple of generals.

10:31.732 --> 10:32.983
Huh...

10:33.066 --> 10:36.320
It could just be Richard
showing off for some VIPs.

10:36.404 --> 10:37.988
But if they're gonna be around...

10:38.071 --> 10:40.241
it's gonna make our job even harder.

10:45.454 --> 10:47.122
[electrical pulsing]

10:47.956 --> 10:49.375
[groans]

10:49.458 --> 10:52.586
It is the precise time you
requested I alert you.

10:54.171 --> 10:56.424
[yawns] Fine.

10:56.507 --> 10:58.175
Fortunately, unlike you,

10:58.259 --> 11:00.928
I do not need
predetermined rest intervals.

11:01.011 --> 11:03.306
Neither do our toys.

11:03.389 --> 11:07.393
[Botila] Human children can be
so easily duped by a mere plaything.

11:07.476 --> 11:10.438
Exactly. That's why my plan can't fail.

11:10.521 --> 11:13.273
Ah! As long as you didn't.

11:14.358 --> 11:17.528
[Botila] I made certain
all the children of the military leaders

11:17.611 --> 11:19.822
took home a toy monkey.

11:19.905 --> 11:21.907
Then let the games begin!

11:27.955 --> 11:29.748
- [chittering]
- [electrical pulsing]

11:36.797 --> 11:38.549
[chitters]

11:38.632 --> 11:40.676
[chitters]

12:14.877 --> 12:16.795
- [chitters]
- [powering down]

12:20.591 --> 12:25.095
Any moment now I'll have my
own fleet of military-grade vehicles

12:25.178 --> 12:29.099
to hunt and poach anything
anywhere I choose.

12:29.182 --> 12:33.270
Speaking of hunting, haven't you
discovered Lukas' hideout yet?

12:33.353 --> 12:34.647
Negative.

12:34.730 --> 12:39.652
By my calculations, he is leading us
on the proverbial wild goose chase.

12:41.361 --> 12:44.281
So much for your brilliant idea.

12:44.364 --> 12:45.783
Well, keep tailing them...

12:45.866 --> 12:50.328
in case, by some miracle,
your plan might actually work.

12:51.329 --> 12:52.998
[snoring]

12:53.081 --> 12:54.417
- [electrical pulsing]
- [chittering]

12:57.795 --> 12:59.922
[grunting]

13:02.591 --> 13:04.051
[roars]

13:06.429 --> 13:07.763
[grunting]

13:10.265 --> 13:11.642
[growling]

13:11.725 --> 13:12.851
[Danny] What's going on?

13:13.686 --> 13:16.104
- Kong, are you hurt?
- Where's the fire?

13:16.188 --> 13:17.815
[grunting]

13:17.898 --> 13:20.400
Yo, Kong-O, what's the deal, yo?
Why'd you...

13:20.484 --> 13:22.820
[grunting]

13:22.903 --> 13:25.322
I can't remember when
I've seen him this upset.

13:25.405 --> 13:26.449
What's he telling you, Danny?

13:26.532 --> 13:29.660
He's like all over the place, rambling,
but I keep getting...

13:29.743 --> 13:31.704
"Monkey, fire eyes."

13:31.787 --> 13:33.121
[grunting]

13:35.666 --> 13:38.168
- Whoa, bro!
- Where are we going?

13:39.127 --> 13:40.504
[grunting]

13:41.379 --> 13:43.048
[hooting]

13:44.675 --> 13:47.970
[Danny] Oh, we see it, Kong.
We just don't believe it.

13:48.053 --> 13:51.306
[Panchi] Aren't those military aircraft?
[Lukas] Definitely.

13:51.389 --> 13:54.810
Could Richard be involved in some
top-secret mission for the government?

13:54.893 --> 13:57.020
[scoffs] More likely for himself.

13:57.104 --> 13:58.731
Good thing Kong spotted them.

13:58.814 --> 14:00.691
[grunting]

14:05.445 --> 14:07.322
Do you think anyone else saw it?

14:07.405 --> 14:12.202
Middle of the night, Kong Island's
surrounded by low-level fog... I doubt it.

14:12.285 --> 14:15.080
So how are we gonna
get the monkeys away from Richard,

14:15.163 --> 14:16.832
now that he has all that firepower?

14:16.915 --> 14:18.333
I'm not sure.

14:18.416 --> 14:20.836
But the good news is,
thanks to Jonesy and Amy,

14:20.919 --> 14:24.381
my brother still thinks
we're all halfway across the world.

14:24.465 --> 14:25.674
I hope.

14:27.843 --> 14:30.262
There's something
bothering me about...

14:30.345 --> 14:32.931
Hmm. A very lucrative evening.

14:33.015 --> 14:38.979
One V-63 Destructon, two Scorpion
stealth copters, fully loaded, two...

14:39.062 --> 14:40.397
There! That's it!

14:40.481 --> 14:43.025
Holo-screen, rewind two frames.

14:43.108 --> 14:44.234
Freeze.

14:45.235 --> 14:47.613
Zoom in on the figures
in the background.

14:49.948 --> 14:53.243
[Botila] The boy appears to be
communicating with the monkey.

14:53.326 --> 14:56.079
Danny Quon, in disguise.

14:56.163 --> 14:58.165
So he was here.

14:58.248 --> 15:03.378
And where Danny Quon is, your brother
and Kong are not very far away.

15:03.461 --> 15:05.380
Where does the tracking device put them?

15:05.463 --> 15:07.424
Over Mongolia.

15:07.508 --> 15:10.719
So Lukas did send us
on a wild goose chase!

15:10.803 --> 15:14.472
As you mortals like to say,
"Turnaround is fair play."

15:14.557 --> 15:16.559
Just call back the pterodactyls!

15:16.642 --> 15:20.979
[Botila] <i>Too late.
They did not stop to recharge, so...</i>

15:23.566 --> 15:26.860
Wait! I gave Danny a toy to take home!

15:26.944 --> 15:28.862
You can use it to track their location.

15:28.946 --> 15:31.865
- [electrical pulsing]
- Unfortunately...

15:31.949 --> 15:34.785
<i>the unit has been rendered nonfunctional.</i>

15:34.868 --> 15:39.497
Lukas and his overgrown ape
are probably spying on us as we speak!

15:39.582 --> 15:42.167
Time for a change of plans.

15:44.670 --> 15:46.338
[grunting]

15:46.421 --> 15:47.923
Something's happening!

15:48.006 --> 15:49.507
[gasps] They're leaving.

15:52.094 --> 15:53.470
And that's Richard's copter.

15:53.554 --> 15:56.807
- Where do you think they're going?
- We can't worry about that now.

15:56.890 --> 16:00.143
This could be our only chance
to get those monkeys out of there.

16:00.227 --> 16:01.979
Kong... suit up.

16:02.062 --> 16:03.396
[grunting]

16:15.659 --> 16:17.870
Let's find 'em, and get out of here.

16:19.121 --> 16:21.456
Hmm... like a mouse to the cheese.

16:21.539 --> 16:24.710
Botila, my new air force
has been gone long enough.

16:25.836 --> 16:27.337
[electricity surging]

16:38.015 --> 16:39.975
Yo, monkeys, where are ya?

16:42.895 --> 16:44.897
Look, Kong found them.

16:44.980 --> 16:47.357
[grunting]

16:47.440 --> 16:49.860
- [chittering]
- [chuckling]

16:49.943 --> 16:53.571
[laughing] Oh, yeah!
You guys are gonna get along great!

16:53.656 --> 16:56.784
[Richard over PA] <i>Welcome, brother!
It's so good to see you here.</i>

16:56.867 --> 17:00.037
<i>And thank you for delivering Kong to me.</i>

17:00.120 --> 17:01.246
Lukas!

17:03.916 --> 17:07.294
No, it's a trap!
And I brought Kong right into it!

17:08.628 --> 17:09.672
[grunting]

17:14.217 --> 17:16.011
Kong, do not hurt the pilots!

17:17.554 --> 17:18.972
[roaring]

17:20.891 --> 17:22.142
[grunts] Take cover!

17:23.518 --> 17:26.396
[roaring]

17:28.522 --> 17:31.860
I've finally done it!
Kong is going down!

17:31.944 --> 17:33.862
[roaring]

17:35.197 --> 17:36.239
[hooting]

17:36.323 --> 17:38.701
I don't how long Kong can keep this up!

17:38.784 --> 17:40.828
[roaring]

17:49.211 --> 17:50.796
- Did you see that pilot?
- No.

17:50.879 --> 17:52.798
Neither did I.
'Cause there wasn't one!

17:57.177 --> 17:59.763
They're all empty.
I've gotta tell Kong!

17:59.847 --> 18:01.724
No, Danny, I do!

18:01.807 --> 18:03.809
What if he doesn't understand you?

18:03.892 --> 18:05.393
He has to!

18:08.772 --> 18:13.694
Kong, there's no one inside!
No people to harm.

18:13.777 --> 18:15.362
[grunting] Huh?

18:15.445 --> 18:18.115
You can fight back!

18:19.324 --> 18:21.827
- Trust me!
- [grunts]

18:23.161 --> 18:25.873
[roaring]

18:28.666 --> 18:31.669
Don't hold back, bro!
Fight! Fight!

18:31.754 --> 18:33.881
[growling softly]

18:33.964 --> 18:35.257
[roaring]

18:40.345 --> 18:42.347
Oh, no. No!

18:42.430 --> 18:43.807
[screaming] No!

19:01.909 --> 19:03.285
[roaring]

19:24.973 --> 19:27.893
Now that's what I call
knocking it out of the park!

19:29.394 --> 19:31.188
- [gunships firing]
- [roaring]

19:40.864 --> 19:42.699
[panting]

19:42.783 --> 19:44.076
[grunting]

19:48.872 --> 19:50.373
[roaring]

19:50.457 --> 19:53.001
Come on. Let's go home.

19:53.085 --> 19:56.046
[roaring]

19:56.964 --> 19:59.842
[sobbing] My entire fleet...

19:59.925 --> 20:02.094
It's... gone!

20:02.177 --> 20:05.555
Allow me to analyze
the unfairness of it all.

20:05.638 --> 20:09.184
Go clean up that mess,
you snarky bot!

20:10.435 --> 20:12.645
- [Danny laughing]
- [Kong grunting]

20:12.729 --> 20:14.106
[Danny grunts] Over here.

20:14.189 --> 20:16.358
Bawk! Penalty!

20:16.441 --> 20:17.734
[Lukas laughing]

20:18.360 --> 20:21.154
[sighs] When Amy and Jonesy
get back with our chopper,

20:21.238 --> 20:23.740
we'll relocate the monkeys
someplace safe.

20:23.824 --> 20:28.411
Well, as safe as anywhere
can be for wildlife in 2050.

20:28.495 --> 20:30.538
- [chittering]
- [laughing]

20:30.622 --> 20:33.917
With ruthless people like Richard
and his poachers on the hunt...

20:34.001 --> 20:35.961
no animal is truly safe.

20:40.298 --> 20:42.134
My compliments, Botila.

20:42.217 --> 20:45.178
There's not a trace that
the aircraft were ever here.

20:45.262 --> 20:47.931
If you decide you
want them for spare parts,

20:48.015 --> 20:49.850
you'll find them at the bottom of the bay.

20:49.933 --> 20:53.686
No need.
There's more where they came from.

20:53.770 --> 20:57.941
This is supposed to be
a high-security facility!

20:58.859 --> 21:00.277
Tell me, Captain...

21:00.360 --> 21:03.321
or should I say, Private?

21:03.405 --> 21:09.202
[yelling] How in blazes did someone
waltz in and hijack my aircraft?

21:16.043 --> 21:18.086
[electrical pulsing]

21:19.171 --> 21:21.214
