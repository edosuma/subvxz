00:17.225 --> 00:18.476
[door opens]

00:19.436 --> 00:21.604
[indistinct chatter]

00:21.688 --> 00:22.939
Thank you so much for coming.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.399
-Good to see you again.
-Thank you.

00:24.482 --> 00:25.483
[Zhang] Thanks.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.826
[both speaking Mandarin]

00:44.001 --> 00:45.837
-We're closed.
-[Matt] We need to kill the lights.

00:45.920 --> 00:48.465
-How do you even know they're on?
-Hey, I said we're closed!

00:48.548 --> 00:49.882
We need to stay off the streets.

00:49.966 --> 00:52.260
Well, stay off them somewhere else.
I'll call the police.

00:52.344 --> 00:54.887
You can't do that.
You'd be putting the cops in danger.

00:54.971 --> 00:57.682
-I'll put you in danger.
-[Jessica] I'm done explaining this.

01:01.728 --> 01:03.105
[in Mandarin] What are you doing?

01:03.188 --> 01:04.564
Whoa! She is very strong.

01:04.647 --> 01:07.109
Sir, this is for your protection.
We need this place to look closed.

01:07.192 --> 01:08.693
[in Mandarin] It is closed!

01:08.776 --> 01:10.820
[in Mandarin] We have no intention
of hurting you.

01:10.903 --> 01:12.697
-You speak Chinese?
-[in Mandarin] You can trust us.

01:12.780 --> 01:13.906
I still hear neon.

01:15.158 --> 01:16.743
-Who hears neon?
-[Jessica sighs]

01:16.826 --> 01:20.497
-My blind-but-maybe-not lawyer.
-You're what? What do you mean he's blind?

01:20.580 --> 01:21.748
I don't know.

01:22.540 --> 01:24.834
I thought he was sent to spy on me,
and now I'm not so sure.

01:24.917 --> 01:27.545
-You think he's on our side?
-Our side of what?

01:29.005 --> 01:31.591
-Who's Karate Kid?
-[Luke] Danny Rand.

01:31.674 --> 01:32.967
Boy billionaire?

01:33.050 --> 01:34.219
He's a little off in the head,

01:34.302 --> 01:37.305
but he packs a mean right hook
when it counts.

01:37.389 --> 01:38.431
So do you.

01:39.182 --> 01:40.350
You okay?

01:41.058 --> 01:43.728
-Now, or in general?
-Both.

01:44.604 --> 01:47.565
[sighs] Well, I'm alive. You?

01:48.191 --> 01:49.859
Just getting back into the world.

01:49.942 --> 01:52.362
-From where?
-Prison.

01:53.280 --> 01:55.115
Yeah, we'll... we'll talk about it later.

01:55.198 --> 01:56.408
How'd you end up here?

01:56.491 --> 01:58.951
-I'm working a case.
-Yeah?

01:59.035 --> 02:00.995
-How's that going for you so far?
-[chuckles]

02:01.078 --> 02:03.206
All right, back door is clear.
Everything's locked.

02:03.790 --> 02:04.916
I think we're safe for now.

02:04.999 --> 02:07.585
-So we're just gonna wait it out here?
-You got a better plan?

02:07.669 --> 02:09.379
Is there a plan where I get my scarf back?

02:09.462 --> 02:10.755
I just need it till this is over.

02:12.799 --> 02:15.135
-What, do you two know each other?
-Yeah.

02:15.218 --> 02:16.553
[Matt] How?

02:18.095 --> 02:20.932
We met. We drank.
I shot him in the head.

02:21.015 --> 02:22.975
-[chuckles]
-Why are you still wearing that thing?

02:23.059 --> 02:24.977
-It's--
-[in English] Okay. He says we can stay.

02:25.061 --> 02:27.397
-What did you tell him?
-Uh, I just gave him my black card,

02:27.480 --> 02:30.317
agreed to pay the rent
for the next six months. [chuckles]

02:30.400 --> 02:32.985
-Hey, I'm, uh... I'm Danny.
-Jessica.

02:33.695 --> 02:36.447
-And, uh... you are?
-No, I can't. I'm not doing this.

02:36.531 --> 02:38.074
-Doing what?
-Whatever happened back there,

02:38.158 --> 02:39.701
we did what we had to.
We got out alive.

02:39.784 --> 02:41.453
The less we know about each other,
the better.

02:41.536 --> 02:43.120
-This is... It's too much already.
-Okay.

02:43.205 --> 02:44.789
-Don't--
-Jesus.

02:44.872 --> 02:47.292
-There are people I need to protect...
-You're not the only one.

02:47.375 --> 02:48.835
...and the organization
we just fought are powerful.

02:48.918 --> 02:51.045
-Yeah, who are they?
-They call themselves the Hand.

02:51.963 --> 02:54.090
-What are they really called?
-No, he's... he's right.

02:54.882 --> 02:56.008
You crossed paths with them before?

02:56.092 --> 02:57.552
-Yeah.
-[Danny] When?

02:58.177 --> 03:00.012
-It doesn't matter.
-Bullshit it doesn't matter.

03:00.096 --> 03:02.640
-Yeah, I'm with her.
-We need to figure out our next move.

03:02.724 --> 03:04.183
[chuckles] No. There's no next move.

03:04.267 --> 03:06.769
And there is no "we."
They came at us, we fought our way out.

03:06.853 --> 03:08.521
Let's call it professional courtesy.
End of story.

03:08.605 --> 03:09.731
Look, it's not that simple.

03:09.814 --> 03:12.859
-These people, they're dangerous.
-So am I.

03:12.942 --> 03:17.489
Now, somebody tell me what I need to know
about the Hand, so I can be on my way.

03:17.572 --> 03:18.573
What is that?

03:19.616 --> 03:21.075
[Danny] Oh. Um, as, uh...

03:21.158 --> 03:23.953
as part of the deal,
he made me order four of everything.

03:24.036 --> 03:25.455
We're not here to eat.

03:27.332 --> 03:29.667
-Uh, are those pork?
-No, they're shrimp.

03:29.751 --> 03:30.835
Oh.

03:30.918 --> 03:33.630
-Oh. This guy's got pork.
-Ah, great!

03:33.713 --> 03:36.007
[sighs] God, you're weird.

03:38.385 --> 03:40.637
[Danny] The Hand is an ancient
criminal organization.

03:40.720 --> 03:42.096
Define ancient.

03:42.179 --> 03:44.849
-They live forever.
-[scoffs] You wanna try that again?

03:44.932 --> 03:46.226
[Matt] They live by a fanatical ideology,

03:46.309 --> 03:47.810
and every member is willing to die
to protect it.

03:47.894 --> 03:49.312
-So they're terrorists?
-[Matt] No.

03:49.396 --> 03:50.855
Terrorists want the world to know
what they're doing.

03:50.938 --> 03:53.024
This is something more secret,
more evil.

03:53.107 --> 03:54.609
And they're global.

03:54.692 --> 03:56.653
-So what do they do?
-Everything.

03:56.736 --> 03:58.363
Including the recruitment
of young men in Harlem?

03:58.446 --> 04:01.073
Apparently. They're in New York
for a reason, but I don't know why.

04:01.157 --> 04:03.200
-What do you mean, "fanatical ideology"?
-Gonna sound crazy--

04:03.285 --> 04:05.202
-What do they want?
-[Danny] Immortality.

04:05.287 --> 04:08.290
They want power and influence
at every level across the world.

04:09.874 --> 04:11.125
And I think they want me.

04:11.208 --> 04:12.669
-For your money?
-No.

04:15.004 --> 04:16.381
-I'm the Immortal Iron Fist.
-[scoffs]

04:16.464 --> 04:17.465
Come again?

04:18.090 --> 04:19.426
Sworn protector of K'un-Lun.

04:19.509 --> 04:21.052
What are you on? Lithium?

04:21.135 --> 04:23.346
[Luke] So, who was the woman
with the swords?

04:23.430 --> 04:26.766
Look, I'm not sure,
but I fought her in Cambodia.

04:26.849 --> 04:28.142
Yeah, and she showed up at my doorstep.

04:28.225 --> 04:29.894
She's the one that came after your client?

04:29.977 --> 04:31.646
Yeah. Why? Do you know her?

04:32.647 --> 04:34.982
-[stammers] No.
-Well, she sure knew what she was doing.

04:35.066 --> 04:37.068
[Danny] The Hand trains fighters
to be merciless.

04:37.151 --> 04:39.362
But whoever she was,
man, she was something else.

04:39.446 --> 04:41.323
-This is a mistake. I gotta go.
-Where?

04:41.406 --> 04:42.990
I can't be a part of this.

04:43.074 --> 04:45.952
If you ask me, you already are.
We need to put it all on the table.

04:46.035 --> 04:48.413
-I don't know you. I don't owe you any--
-I don't trust you.

04:50.457 --> 04:52.208
[Matt] You wanna take your hand
off my shoulder?

04:53.876 --> 04:55.503
Take off the mask.

04:56.838 --> 04:58.465
You're not gonna like
where this is heading.

04:59.841 --> 05:01.175
Try me.

05:01.258 --> 05:04.846
Oh, boy. Counselor, a word?

05:15.315 --> 05:16.816
[Jessica] Where do you think you're going?

05:16.899 --> 05:18.234
You're gonna need another lawyer.

05:18.318 --> 05:21.237
-Why did you follow me into the building?
-Ms. Jones, lose my card.

05:21.321 --> 05:22.322
I wish I could.

05:22.405 --> 05:23.990
Look, I've been down this road before.

05:24.073 --> 05:25.950
-I know what we're up against.
-I know who you are.

05:26.033 --> 05:27.410
[chuckles] No, you don't. Trust me.

05:27.494 --> 05:30.162
Yes, I do.
You're the Devil of Hell's Kitchen.

05:31.414 --> 05:32.582
Or Devil Boy,

05:32.665 --> 05:35.042
-or whatever it is you like to be called.
-Whatever you're insinuating,

05:35.126 --> 05:38.170
-I don't have any clue.
-I'm a PI. I put two and two together.

05:38.254 --> 05:42.049
Besides, you leaping around the city like
a Russian gymnast didn't exactly help.

05:43.342 --> 05:46.388
-You don't have any proof.
-I did. You smashed it.

05:47.639 --> 05:50.642
I'm not threatening you.
I'm just stating the obvious.

05:51.350 --> 05:54.353
They saw you fight.
How you're hiding your face.

05:54.437 --> 05:56.606
They're two seconds away
from figuring it out themselves.

05:58.274 --> 05:59.692
-What do you want from me?
-Nothing.

05:59.776 --> 06:02.779
And I want zero to do
with this ancient organization.

06:02.862 --> 06:04.447
I just want to crack my case.

06:06.282 --> 06:07.950
And judging by the way
you sprung into action,

06:08.034 --> 06:09.411
I think you want the same thing.

06:11.162 --> 06:13.330
-Your call, Murdock.
-[Matt sighs]

06:27.762 --> 06:28.971
[sighs]

06:41.859 --> 06:43.027
My name is Matthew.

06:50.284 --> 06:52.286
[theme music playing]

08:21.501 --> 08:24.546
I'd erase all the marks of your past,
if I could.

08:33.179 --> 08:38.184
Your life is new.
But sadly, your body is not.

08:41.437 --> 08:42.689
This is how I died?

08:42.772 --> 08:44.065
Don't worry about that.

08:44.732 --> 08:47.652
All that matters now is how you live.

08:50.863 --> 08:52.281
The Black Sky.

08:53.908 --> 08:55.577
This is all I am?

08:59.831 --> 09:02.083
You say that like it's not enough.

09:03.417 --> 09:04.460
It is.

09:05.753 --> 09:06.963
I just...

09:09.256 --> 09:11.050
You just can't help but wonder.

09:13.510 --> 09:15.555
The woman who lived in this vessel,

09:16.347 --> 09:18.641
she was lost before she came to us.

09:19.225 --> 09:22.812
She was led astray by men
who were afraid of what she was,

09:22.895 --> 09:25.106
of what she was capable of doing.

09:26.357 --> 09:28.735
But destiny is a curious thing,

09:29.485 --> 09:35.116
because this vessel
landed right where it belongs.

09:35.992 --> 09:37.118
With us.

09:39.411 --> 09:40.496
With me.

09:41.956 --> 09:42.957
Who are you?

09:44.083 --> 09:45.459
The Black Sky.

09:46.753 --> 09:48.295
I serve the Hand.

09:49.046 --> 09:52.258
[both] "And together,
we serve life itself."

09:53.885 --> 09:55.637
You are my last hope.

09:57.179 --> 09:59.599
You have seen death, my child.

09:59.682 --> 10:02.101
And like me, you have conquered it.

10:10.026 --> 10:11.235
[sighs]

10:12.111 --> 10:15.990
Don't forget who brought us back.

10:16.908 --> 10:18.450
I will not forget.

10:54.028 --> 10:55.905
[Luke] I heard he just disappeared.

10:55.988 --> 10:57.907
[Matt] That's not exactly how it happened.

10:57.990 --> 11:01.202
[Danny] It just doesn't make any sense.
What do you mean you're Daredevil?

11:01.285 --> 11:03.955
It's a long story.
One I'd rather not tell.

11:04.038 --> 11:05.289
More importantly,
it's a secret I keep

11:05.372 --> 11:07.208
not just for the sake
of protecting myself,

11:07.291 --> 11:08.751
but also for the people that I love.

11:08.835 --> 11:10.837
-Okay. I get that.
-Good.

11:10.920 --> 11:13.715
-I don't. You're blind.
-Yeah, well, sight is overrated.

11:13.798 --> 11:16.092
Look, guys, we need to come up
with some kind of plan here.

11:16.175 --> 11:18.677
The only plan is how do we
get these people off our backs?

11:18.761 --> 11:20.471
Ideally, in a way
that doesn't incriminate us.

11:20.554 --> 11:22.139
Incriminate us?
What are you talking about?

11:22.223 --> 11:23.640
[Jessica] None of us
are on police payroll.

11:23.725 --> 11:25.226
What we did back there was trespassing,

11:25.309 --> 11:27.394
aggravated assault,
and vigilante bullshit.

11:27.478 --> 11:29.230
[Luke] Guys, there's one cop
I think we can trust.

11:30.064 --> 11:32.649
-I think we should bring her in.
-No. You'd be putting her in danger.

11:32.734 --> 11:34.819
[Danny] As will anyone
who goes up against the Hand.

11:34.902 --> 11:37.154
And as for doing this any "legal" way...

11:37.238 --> 11:39.365
Well, look, you saw what happened
when we tried that.

11:39.448 --> 11:41.408
-Is that what that was?
-It started that way.

11:41.492 --> 11:42.827
Look, I even put on a tie.

11:42.910 --> 11:44.578
I promise you,
you cannot fight these people.

11:44.661 --> 11:46.455
Not even with
whatever it is your hand can do.

11:46.538 --> 11:48.040
-It's chi.
-It's not.

11:48.124 --> 11:51.418
What I'm saying is, going at them head on,
that'll get you killed.

11:52.044 --> 11:53.504
Only if we do it alone.

11:59.718 --> 12:00.887
No.

12:00.970 --> 12:03.680
[Danny sighs] Look,
these people took everything from me.

12:04.556 --> 12:06.225
I'm gonna take them down,
one way or another.

12:07.018 --> 12:09.520
I wanted to help one kid.
One family.

12:09.603 --> 12:11.022
I'm the first to admit
when I'm in over my head,

12:11.105 --> 12:12.648
and this is way past my threshold.

12:12.731 --> 12:14.441
What are you talking about?

12:14.525 --> 12:16.402
Bulletproof. Blind ninja.

12:16.485 --> 12:18.070
-Whatever it is you are.
-Classy.

12:18.780 --> 12:20.948
[Danny] I tried being a one-man army,
and it failed.

12:21.032 --> 12:22.033
But this...

12:22.741 --> 12:25.161
This feels like something else
is at work here.

12:25.244 --> 12:28.330
The four of us show up to fight a criminal
organization at the same moment?

12:28.414 --> 12:29.832
How obvious does it have to be?

12:30.416 --> 12:31.500
This...

12:32.459 --> 12:33.836
-This cannot be an accident.
-[Matt] Okay.

12:33.920 --> 12:37.089
[chuckles] I know you mean well,
but we're not whatever you think we are.

12:37.173 --> 12:39.008
All right?
We're four very different people,

12:39.091 --> 12:41.218
and while we might all have been trying
to do some good,

12:41.302 --> 12:43.595
we need to be rational
about how we proceed.

12:45.014 --> 12:47.808
-[footsteps approaching]
-Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

12:47.892 --> 12:48.726
[door opens]

13:01.197 --> 13:05.784
This... is one shitty excuse
for a hideout.

13:06.577 --> 13:07.619
[sighing] Stick.

13:08.412 --> 13:09.413
Matty.

13:10.331 --> 13:11.582
Who the hell are you?

13:13.042 --> 13:15.711
The guy that's gonna help you
save New York.

13:58.504 --> 14:02.008
[Murakami in Japanese] It's a bad idea
to sneak up on a man holding a knife.

14:02.091 --> 14:03.675
[Alexandra in English]
Who says I'm sneaking?

14:03.759 --> 14:05.386
Ursus thibetanus.

14:06.178 --> 14:07.930
[in Japanese] The moon bear.

14:08.639 --> 14:12.309
Endangered now,
but I found this one in Shikoku.

14:12.393 --> 14:13.978
[in English] I heard you were in Japan.

14:14.061 --> 14:15.729
[in Japanese] Were you having me followed?

14:16.647 --> 14:18.274
[Alexandra in English]
You have your sport, I have mine.

14:20.109 --> 14:22.319
Ten days, I tracked him.

14:22.403 --> 14:25.739
We sparred in the forest.

14:25.822 --> 14:27.616
He nearly killed me.

14:28.325 --> 14:30.536
They always nearly kill you.

14:31.370 --> 14:33.580
There's no fun in it otherwise.

14:33.664 --> 14:36.667
You know where the organization stands.

14:36.750 --> 14:38.585
Our resources are depleted.

14:38.669 --> 14:42.339
Is that why you came here?
To scold me like a child?

14:42.423 --> 14:46.928
No, but you should worry
about the possibility of death.

14:47.011 --> 14:52.641
From what I hear,
we all should be worried.

14:54.101 --> 14:55.686
We're close now.

14:55.769 --> 14:57.771
And the Iron Fist
has returned to New York.

14:57.854 --> 15:01.567
I heard you were unable to secure him.

15:01.650 --> 15:02.693
We will.

15:04.236 --> 15:06.197
Then we're not close enough.

15:11.202 --> 15:14.830
The problem with your leadership
has always been

15:14.914 --> 15:17.249
your inability to get your hands dirty.

15:18.792 --> 15:20.086
[takes deep breath]

15:22.338 --> 15:27.593
In all our time together,
I have never asked for your advice.

15:28.385 --> 15:29.678
And why would you?

15:29.761 --> 15:33.640
Now that you have
the Black Sky by your side.

15:34.225 --> 15:35.267
[mutters] Yeah.

15:35.351 --> 15:37.311
The Iron Fist was not alone.

15:37.394 --> 15:40.481
Was the Chaste not extinguished?

15:40.564 --> 15:43.650
He seems to have found some allies.
Three of them.

15:46.778 --> 15:47.904
Only three?

15:48.739 --> 15:51.033
They were rather exceptional.

15:52.451 --> 15:54.495
And so, you come to me.

15:55.829 --> 16:00.709
I come to you because it's important
that we take care of this together.

16:02.878 --> 16:05.006
Have you told the others?

16:05.089 --> 16:07.883
Madame Gao and Sowande
are ready and willing.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.426
And the other one?

16:10.136 --> 16:11.303
On his way.

16:12.513 --> 16:13.680
[sighs]

16:14.723 --> 16:17.476
I always knew we'd reunite someday.

16:17.559 --> 16:20.229
I never thought the circumstances
would be this dire.

16:21.272 --> 16:23.315
That's what families do, isn't it?

16:24.108 --> 16:28.529
And what of your Black Sky?

16:28.612 --> 16:31.823
The thing you spent
our final resources on.

16:31.907 --> 16:34.451
More powerful than you could ever imagine.

16:36.620 --> 16:38.247
[sighs]

16:38.330 --> 16:41.000
Does this mean

16:41.083 --> 16:46.713
our faithful leader herself
will also join the fight?

16:48.090 --> 16:51.093
As always, I do what's necessary.

16:52.094 --> 16:57.974
Then, as we used to say...

17:00.102 --> 17:03.189
"Together, we serve life itself."

17:03.272 --> 17:06.567
[in Japanese] "Together,
we serve life itself."

17:39.808 --> 17:42.103
[footsteps approaching]

17:43.479 --> 17:44.730
Black Sky.

17:47.608 --> 17:50.361
Perhaps you'd be
more effective on the battlefield

17:50.444 --> 17:52.113
if you killed your enemies,

17:52.196 --> 17:54.448
rather than letting them escape.

17:54.531 --> 17:58.327
Alexandra insisted we use
the last of our resources on you.

17:59.203 --> 18:01.288
The ultimate weapon of the Hand.

18:01.372 --> 18:03.499
But after your recent failure...

18:04.625 --> 18:05.626
well,

18:06.210 --> 18:09.296
I can't help but ask myself
if you are a weapon at all.

18:10.797 --> 18:12.841
[men grunting and groaning]

18:13.967 --> 18:15.261
-[grunts]
-[bones snapping]

18:15.344 --> 18:16.928
[pants]

18:21.142 --> 18:22.309
Keep asking.

18:26.272 --> 18:28.357
[in Mandarin] Does that man have one hand?

18:31.235 --> 18:34.155
-How did you find us, Stick?
-You know this guy?

18:34.238 --> 18:36.282
-It's complicated.
-Then uncomplicate it.

18:36.365 --> 18:38.367
-He's one of them, aren't you?
-[Luke] The Hand?

18:38.450 --> 18:40.286
No. There's another organization.

18:40.994 --> 18:42.621
We call ourselves the Chaste.

18:42.704 --> 18:44.498
Ugh! These names are killing me.

18:44.581 --> 18:48.544
And we're the only reason
the Hand hasn't already won the war.

18:48.627 --> 18:54.175
We follow the elders of K'un-Lun...
and the Immortal Iron Fist.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.343
The Chaste is my army?

18:56.427 --> 18:58.637
Was. They're all dead now.

18:59.221 --> 19:01.848
Every one, except me.

19:01.932 --> 19:03.642
How come no one told me?

19:03.725 --> 19:05.436
[Stick] There are things I don't know.

19:06.187 --> 19:07.771
Why are you here, Stick?

19:07.854 --> 19:09.440
Because this one,

19:09.523 --> 19:14.528
the Immortal Iron Fist, living weapon
and protector of the ancient city,

19:15.571 --> 19:18.240
is still a thundering dumbass.

19:19.032 --> 19:21.327
New rules, kid. Shit like that...

19:22.994 --> 19:24.538
will get you killed.

19:24.621 --> 19:27.249
[stammers] I tried to call Colleen.

19:27.333 --> 19:30.126
I told her where I was.
Where is she?

19:30.211 --> 19:31.962
-[sighs]
-Safer than we are.

19:32.838 --> 19:35.549
Small mistakes. Personal ties.

19:36.132 --> 19:38.260
These are what they'll use to end you.

19:38.344 --> 19:39.845
What happened to your hand?

19:39.928 --> 19:41.888
Ah, I cut it off to free myself.

19:42.473 --> 19:45.226
Now, I need your help.

19:45.309 --> 19:48.229
-[chuckles] Yeah, here it comes.
-Here what comes?

19:48.312 --> 19:50.439
-This is what he does.
-How do you know him again?

19:50.522 --> 19:52.441
You saw me fighting?
I learned it from him.

19:52.524 --> 19:54.735
You're a blind lawyer, you're Daredevil,

19:54.818 --> 19:56.737
-and you're a member of the Chaste?
-No, uh-uh.

19:56.820 --> 19:58.989
I never joined his war.
Hey, Stick, you and I need to talk.

19:59.072 --> 20:00.866
[Luke] Anything you gotta say,
you say in front of us.

20:00.949 --> 20:03.159
-This is between me and him.
-Hey, we are all in danger.

20:03.244 --> 20:05.329
I don't know you very well, Mr. Cage,
you seem like a good guy,

20:05.412 --> 20:08.164
so trust me when I tell you
that with this old man, nothing is sacred.

20:08.249 --> 20:10.041
Kid, it's not just one of us this time.

20:10.125 --> 20:12.168
It's the whole goddamn city
we're talking about.

20:12.253 --> 20:14.213
We're talking about their lives, Stick.

20:14.296 --> 20:16.047
We're talking about the lives
of their loved ones.

20:16.131 --> 20:18.800
-Wait, um, what?
-Those tremors that shook up the place,

20:18.884 --> 20:20.844
they're nothing
compared to what comes next.

20:20.927 --> 20:23.847
The Hand's done it before.
Pompeii, Chernobyl.

20:23.930 --> 20:28.184
Events the history books
like to call catastrophes, just cover-ups.

20:28.269 --> 20:30.229
'Cause New York is next.

20:30.896 --> 20:35.108
And the only thing keeping Manhattan
from crumbling to a pile of dust...

20:36.943 --> 20:38.194
is the four of you.

20:39.238 --> 20:41.865
All right, I am done
with this tin-foil-hat shit.

20:41.948 --> 20:45.201
-Whoa, where are you going?
-I tried to hang in, guys. I really did.

20:45.286 --> 20:47.371
But whatever this guy's selling,
I ain't buying.

20:47.454 --> 20:48.789
Sit down and shut up.

20:53.168 --> 20:54.836
-[Luke] Jessica.
-It's not gonna work.

20:54.920 --> 20:56.672
[Luke] I know parts of this sound crazy.

20:56.755 --> 20:58.382
[sighs] Parts of it?

20:59.508 --> 21:02.469
Throw out all this mystical,
ancient conspiracy stuff,

21:02.553 --> 21:04.930
and you're still left with one hard fact.

21:05.556 --> 21:06.723
People are gonna get hurt.

21:07.974 --> 21:09.893
-Not you.
-[Luke] This isn't about me.

21:09.976 --> 21:11.937
That's a concept you might want
to try on sometime.

21:12.020 --> 21:13.229
[scoffs] Give me a break.

21:13.314 --> 21:16.149
Hey, these abilities
that you have such contempt for...

21:17.859 --> 21:19.445
they might do some good right now.

21:21.572 --> 21:23.824
This war, or whatever it is,

21:24.408 --> 21:27.077
this is not my problem.
I just want to get answers for my client.

21:27.160 --> 21:28.412
I want answers, too.

21:28.995 --> 21:32.123
And I'll play along with all this
crazy stuff if it helps me to find them.

21:33.709 --> 21:36.920
I don't know what it is that makes you
care so much about other people,

21:37.588 --> 21:39.047
but that's not me.

21:43.635 --> 21:44.928
It was good to see you.

21:46.388 --> 21:48.349
Let me know
when they fit you for a costume.

21:51.267 --> 21:52.311
Jessica.

21:55.230 --> 21:56.231
Just...

21:58.817 --> 21:59.985
be careful.

22:01.862 --> 22:03.905
-Yeah, you too.
-And, um...

22:07.242 --> 22:08.535
it was good seeing you.

22:10.329 --> 22:11.330
Yeah.

22:14.249 --> 22:15.250
Yeah.

22:32.434 --> 22:33.644
[Stick] She coming back?

22:34.227 --> 22:35.479
[Matt] No, she left.

22:36.938 --> 22:38.023
[Danny] Use your powers?

22:38.690 --> 22:40.401
[Matt] No, I've just met her.

22:42.861 --> 22:44.530
How can she not understand
how big this is?

22:44.613 --> 22:47.323
Well, I don't know her too well,
but like me, she has a life.

22:47.408 --> 22:49.701
No matter how big or small it is,
it's still hers.

22:50.619 --> 22:52.704
After all you've been through, Matty,

22:52.788 --> 22:55.957
I thought you'd be more open-minded
when the time came.

22:56.041 --> 22:58.794
[chuckles] Well, forgive me
if I'm not excited

22:58.877 --> 23:02.255
at the prospect of facing
the Hand again. Yeah?

23:03.632 --> 23:05.341
How'd you get involved in the first place?

23:05.426 --> 23:09.220
He's one of the most naturally skilled
fighters I've ever known.

23:09.304 --> 23:10.431
I saw.

23:10.514 --> 23:12.599
Yeah, I trained him to fight a war.

23:12.683 --> 23:16.520
[scoffs] He decided to put on an outfit.

23:17.270 --> 23:19.523
Stop muggers in back alleys.

23:20.857 --> 23:23.819
Well, from what I've heard,
you're... you're doing a good job.

23:24.402 --> 23:26.697
Past tense. He's retired.

23:26.780 --> 23:29.282
You know what?
We are not talking about this, all right?

23:29.365 --> 23:30.534
Suit yourself.

23:31.618 --> 23:35.080
But I think you two have got
a lot to learn from each other.

23:35.872 --> 23:37.833
-Of course.
-I'm done taking lessons, Stick.

23:37.916 --> 23:39.876
Lessons ain't done with you.

23:44.590 --> 23:45.882
This isn't her fight.

23:45.966 --> 23:49.052
Sooner or later,
it's gonna be everybody's fight.

23:49.720 --> 23:50.929
Not if I can help it.

23:51.513 --> 23:52.681
Me neither.

23:54.015 --> 23:56.184
All right. Let's just get this over with.

23:57.728 --> 24:03.734
Seems like now is the time for you
to tell us everything we need to know.

24:14.578 --> 24:16.204
[breathes deeply]

24:27.549 --> 24:29.009
[sighs]

24:35.641 --> 24:36.683
Thank you.

24:51.489 --> 24:53.617
[breathing heavily]

24:55.994 --> 24:57.162
[grunts]

25:08.339 --> 25:09.465
[grunts]

25:11.927 --> 25:14.555
[continues breathing heavily]

25:23.772 --> 25:25.899
Yes, there's been a change of plans.

25:26.567 --> 25:28.068
I have other business tonight.

25:33.489 --> 25:34.783
[sighing]

25:46.587 --> 25:47.963
[exhales heavily]

25:50.423 --> 25:51.592
[sighs]

25:59.182 --> 26:00.516
-[sighs]
-[door closes]

26:51.609 --> 26:53.904
All right. Delete.

27:30.356 --> 27:31.649
That's the same person.

27:32.358 --> 27:33.651
What the hell?

27:50.043 --> 27:51.962
[Stick] Nobody knows when it started.

27:52.879 --> 27:55.673
Centuries ago. Millennia.
It doesn't matter.

27:55.757 --> 27:59.803
But a long time ago,
the elders of K'un-Lun gathered

27:59.886 --> 28:02.806
to study how to harness their chi.

28:02.889 --> 28:05.100
The energy of life itself.

28:05.934 --> 28:08.061
They wanted to use it to heal.

28:08.144 --> 28:12.023
But there were five heretics among them,

28:12.107 --> 28:14.234
people with darker intentions.

28:14.317 --> 28:17.863
They didn't want to heal.
They wanted immortality.

28:17.946 --> 28:20.991
Power. To never face death.

28:21.074 --> 28:24.452
To regenerate themselves again and again.

28:25.829 --> 28:28.123
The elders saw this as an aberration.

28:28.206 --> 28:30.959
And so, like Lucifer from heaven,

28:31.667 --> 28:34.712
the five were banished
from K'un-Lun forever.

28:37.132 --> 28:39.885
They became the five fingers of the Hand.

28:39.968 --> 28:42.345
I came face-to-face
with a woman at Midland Circle.

28:42.929 --> 28:44.514
She said she was the Hand.

28:46.099 --> 28:48.643
She's had a lot of names
throughout the years.

28:48.727 --> 28:51.772
In my lifetime, Alexandra.

28:52.355 --> 28:54.607
And she's led them since the beginning.

28:54.690 --> 28:56.276
When they dispersed,

28:56.359 --> 28:58.653
they all went back
to their mother countries,

28:58.737 --> 29:01.447
each finger ruling over its own domain.

29:01.531 --> 29:04.617
Growing in power and influence.

29:04.700 --> 29:06.036
Madame Gao?

29:07.120 --> 29:08.204
She's one.

29:08.288 --> 29:10.206
She helped set up my parents' murder.

29:10.290 --> 29:13.126
She set up a lot of murders.

29:14.419 --> 29:20.008
Then there's Sowande, African warlord,
gunrunner, you name it.

29:20.091 --> 29:23.011
-The one I followed.
-Don't follow too closely.

29:23.094 --> 29:24.345
Couple of moves,

29:24.429 --> 29:27.390
he'll slow your pulse
till your heart fails.

29:28.141 --> 29:29.517
Then there's Bakuto.

29:30.185 --> 29:33.063
He's dead.
At least the last time I saw him.

29:33.146 --> 29:34.189
Oh!

29:34.773 --> 29:37.442
Finally, some good news.

29:37.525 --> 29:39.069
Who's the last one?

29:39.152 --> 29:40.361
Murakami.

29:42.155 --> 29:45.200
The guy who pulled the strings
behind Nobu.

29:45.283 --> 29:49.537
Maybe the most secretive,
but when he comes out...

29:50.121 --> 29:52.207
an evil piece of shit.

29:52.833 --> 29:54.084
It's nothing we can't handle together.

29:54.167 --> 29:55.961
That's great, Stick,
but why are you here?

29:56.044 --> 29:57.295
What are you expecting us to do about it?

29:57.378 --> 29:59.047
Don't bullshit me.
I know when you're lying.

29:59.130 --> 30:00.966
Maybe you should just back off a bit.

30:01.049 --> 30:02.884
In the past few minutes,
he's given me more information

30:02.968 --> 30:05.136
-than I ever got from K'un-Lun.
-That's because he wants something.

30:05.220 --> 30:07.597
Because what he wants will put
everyone we care about at risk.

30:07.680 --> 30:09.307
-Yeah, you've said that.
-And I'll keep saying it.

30:09.390 --> 30:12.352
I've lost plenty in this war.
Don't talk to me like I'm some kid!

30:12.435 --> 30:14.062
-Don't act like some kid.
-What did you just say?

30:14.145 --> 30:16.606
-Danny, calm down.
-You calm down, Luke.

30:16.689 --> 30:18.358
You don't get second chances
with these people, all right?

30:18.441 --> 30:21.361
If you're not careful, the next thing
you know, you're dead. Or worse,

30:21.444 --> 30:24.239
you're holding the people you love
the most in the world and--

30:25.781 --> 30:27.826
You get the privilege
of watching them die.

30:29.619 --> 30:32.455
[sighs] All right,
maybe this city is at stake.

30:33.498 --> 30:35.125
Maybe this fight is important.
I get that.

30:35.208 --> 30:37.085
I'm just saying,
imagine knowing for the rest of your life,

30:37.168 --> 30:39.754
you only made it worse
by getting involved. Jesus.

30:58.189 --> 31:00.942
-[knock on door]
-[Jessica sighs]

31:01.692 --> 31:03.403
-Hey.
-What time is it?

31:03.486 --> 31:07.240
[sniffles] Late. Or early.
Depending on your life choices.

31:07.323 --> 31:08.533
Is everything okay?

31:10.701 --> 31:12.745
[sighs] How you holding up?

31:13.329 --> 31:15.290
Fine. I mean...

31:17.125 --> 31:18.584
as well as we can be.

31:20.003 --> 31:21.254
And your daughter?

31:21.922 --> 31:23.006
She's asleep.

31:24.840 --> 31:26.968
-Are you drunk?
-No.

31:29.095 --> 31:32.015
I mean... it doesn't matter.

31:32.098 --> 31:34.142
-You wanna come inside?
-No, I just...

31:34.225 --> 31:35.435
[sighs]

31:35.518 --> 31:37.228
I just wanted to say, you might be right.

31:38.021 --> 31:42.192
So whatever your husband got into,
it just keeps getting weirder and weirder.

31:42.275 --> 31:44.027
-What do you know?
-I can't say,

31:44.110 --> 31:46.321
but I'm gonna work on
getting you guys some protection.

31:46.404 --> 31:48.698
-Like, around-the-clock surveillance.
-Why?

31:49.991 --> 31:52.577
-Uh! Please don't ask.
-No, I just mean...

31:52.660 --> 31:54.704
I thought you already did that.

31:55.330 --> 31:57.498
-What do you mean?
-The car.

31:58.708 --> 32:01.962
It's been there since last night.
He said he was a cop.

32:02.670 --> 32:04.172
Did he show you a badge?

32:04.255 --> 32:05.340
No.

32:06.257 --> 32:09.260
-Stay here.
-[nervously] Wait. Who's in that car?

32:09.344 --> 32:10.886
Stay away from the windows.

32:10.971 --> 32:13.056
Do you hear me?
Go. Be with your daughter.

32:13.139 --> 32:14.182
I'll take care of this.

33:04.732 --> 33:06.901
How are you still hungry?

33:08.486 --> 33:10.571
It takes a lot of energy to summon my chi.

33:10.655 --> 33:11.990
[chuckles]

33:12.615 --> 33:17.120
What? Come on,
you've seen it in action. Twice now.

33:18.246 --> 33:21.207
I liked it better on my side of the fight
and not the side of my face.

33:21.291 --> 33:24.002
[scoffs] Yeah, me too.

33:26.504 --> 33:27.880
Don't get too used to it.

33:29.049 --> 33:30.050
What?

33:31.301 --> 33:34.512
-We make quite a team.
-Oh, let's not use that word.

33:35.555 --> 33:36.597
What word?

33:37.890 --> 33:40.226
Look, I'm not looking for super friends.

33:40.310 --> 33:43.646
[scoffs] Yeah,
you keep on telling yourself that.

33:45.065 --> 33:46.857
You came to Midland Circle for a reason.

33:47.483 --> 33:49.860
I came to help Harlem. Not you.

33:49.944 --> 33:53.073
Come on. I didn't need help.

33:53.156 --> 33:54.740
[chuckles] You serious?

33:54.824 --> 33:59.204
Look, all I'm saying is, like it or not...

34:00.621 --> 34:02.123
we're walking the same path.

34:02.998 --> 34:07.753
We fix this thing together.
Then that path comes to an end.

34:10.048 --> 34:11.049
[scoffing]

34:16.971 --> 34:17.972
Last one?

34:23.311 --> 34:24.520
[sighs]

34:29.900 --> 34:31.236
[chuckles]

34:46.667 --> 34:48.461
I'm glad you found others.

34:49.295 --> 34:50.838
[Matt] Don't act like this is normal.

34:52.715 --> 34:56.010
[Stick] Don't act like I don't know
what's really going on with you.

34:59.180 --> 35:01.182
You crossed paths with her, too?

35:01.266 --> 35:02.642
With who?

35:02.725 --> 35:06.146
Don't bullshit me. Elektra.

35:07.897 --> 35:08.939
How'd you know?

35:09.023 --> 35:10.400
I know you, son.

35:11.776 --> 35:14.904
-She's the only reason you're here.
-She's alive, Stick.

35:15.738 --> 35:17.157
No, she's not.

35:17.782 --> 35:18.949
She's something else.

35:20.743 --> 35:22.453
You didn't mention her in front of them.

35:23.413 --> 35:24.872
Neither did you.

35:26.707 --> 35:28.293
Guess she's our little secret.

35:28.376 --> 35:30.044
I couldn't hear her heartbeat.

35:30.128 --> 35:34.465
[sighs] That's 'cause the girl I trained,
the woman you loved...

35:35.550 --> 35:37.218
she ain't there anymore.

35:37.302 --> 35:39.053
-Maybe we can help her.
-No, we can't.

35:39.637 --> 35:41.889
When they brought her back,
they made her forget.

35:41.972 --> 35:42.973
No.

35:44.392 --> 35:45.643
She hesitated.

35:46.477 --> 35:48.979
She didn't kill me.
She had... She had the chance.

35:49.063 --> 35:51.357
Don't try to make sense of this.

35:52.192 --> 35:55.986
'Cause with you or without you,
when the time comes...

35:56.070 --> 35:59.449
whatever is living inside the body
of Elektra Natchios

35:59.532 --> 36:01.284
is gonna have to die.

36:05.037 --> 36:06.247
[tires screeching]

36:06.331 --> 36:07.748
You hear what I hear?

36:10.710 --> 36:12.044
Someone's outside.

36:17.675 --> 36:18.884
-[grunting]
-[man] Ah!

36:18.968 --> 36:20.135
[groans]

36:22.305 --> 36:24.265
[both grunting]

36:28.894 --> 36:30.188
[man groans]

36:30.271 --> 36:32.857
Jesus, am I the only one left
who doesn't know karate?

36:34.442 --> 36:35.985
[groaning]

36:36.068 --> 36:38.488
This family has been through enough.

36:39.113 --> 36:41.699
Whatever her husband did,
she doesn't know anything.

36:41.782 --> 36:44.285
She's not a threat,
and neither is the kid.

36:44.369 --> 36:46.246
Nod if you understand me.

36:47.538 --> 36:49.582
Now nod if you're gonna leave them alone.

36:49.665 --> 36:50.875
[spits]

36:51.501 --> 36:53.168
[sighs and grunts]

36:55.380 --> 36:56.797
Let me make this very clear.

36:57.382 --> 36:59.300
[man speaking Japanese on radio]

37:00.092 --> 37:01.176
What'd he say?

37:01.261 --> 37:02.970
[man speaking Yoruba on radio]

37:03.554 --> 37:04.972
What language is that?

37:05.055 --> 37:07.225
[both grunt]

37:08.393 --> 37:10.686
I'm no black belt.
You let me know when that hurts.

37:11.562 --> 37:13.606
[man groaning]

37:15.566 --> 37:17.610
[in Mandarin] Stay back there.
Lock the door.

37:26.244 --> 37:27.662
[Luke] You think it's them?

37:30.665 --> 37:31.666
It's hard to tell.

37:33.167 --> 37:34.209
[Luke] How'd they find us?

37:35.378 --> 37:37.087
It was a matter of time.

37:37.838 --> 37:38.881
Who's inside?

37:38.964 --> 37:40.300
[guns cocking in distance]

37:40.383 --> 37:41.426
Weapons.

37:42.092 --> 37:43.511
Couple of guns, fully loaded.

37:44.262 --> 37:48.349
-How about the woman with the swords?
-I don't know. I can't... I can't tell.

37:49.309 --> 37:52.603
[sniffs] Well, I'll be goddamned.

37:54.439 --> 37:58.443
This wouldn't be my first choice,
but I am a sucker for fortune cookies.

37:59.068 --> 38:03.113
You know, I thought it would be
a good idea if we all talked this over...

38:04.114 --> 38:05.491
like adults.

38:06.742 --> 38:08.286
[Stick] What do you want?

38:09.787 --> 38:11.872
You surprised me, Stick.

38:11.956 --> 38:15.000
You've become so resourceful
in your old age.

38:15.084 --> 38:16.251
[sighs]

38:17.169 --> 38:18.713
What have you become in yours?

38:18.796 --> 38:19.922
Determined.

38:21.674 --> 38:26.011
Mr. Rand, I'm sorry your exit
from our meeting was so abrupt.

38:26.095 --> 38:27.430
You tried to kill us.

38:27.513 --> 38:30.766
Oh, them maybe. Not you.

38:31.517 --> 38:34.437
My organization
has always had a great deal of respect

38:34.520 --> 38:36.021
for the protector of K'un-Lun.

38:36.105 --> 38:37.982
Your respect means nothing to me.

38:38.941 --> 38:41.026
My only purpose is to take you down.

38:41.652 --> 38:44.489
Something you've repeatedly failed to do.

38:45.239 --> 38:48.158
Perhaps it's time
to consider some alternatives.

38:48.242 --> 38:49.702
There are no alternatives.

38:49.785 --> 38:52.705
Oh, darling,
there are always alternatives.

38:53.789 --> 38:55.708
That's what makes life interesting.

38:56.709 --> 38:58.628
Cut the shit, Alexandra.

38:59.670 --> 39:03.090
-What do you want?
-The same thing I've always wanted.

39:03.173 --> 39:04.675
To bring light into the dark.

39:04.759 --> 39:07.678
To bring life where there is death.

39:08.721 --> 39:12.933
For all your talk of life,
you sure kill a lot of people.

39:21.359 --> 39:24.236
I don't think we've been
properly introduced.

39:26.947 --> 39:28.658
Let's keep it that way.

39:32.703 --> 39:36.374
I can see you've formed
a kind of bond here.

39:36.457 --> 39:38.459
And while that might give you
some comfort,

39:38.543 --> 39:40.294
I promise you, it's temporary.

39:41.921 --> 39:43.548
They will disappoint you.

39:45.090 --> 39:46.091
They haven't yet.

39:46.717 --> 39:48.844
They will not make you stronger.

39:48.928 --> 39:51.346
And if I might give you some advice,

39:51.431 --> 39:55.851
the more connections you have,
the easier it will be to break you.

39:56.561 --> 39:58.854
What do you want to do with him?

39:58.938 --> 40:00.815
Well, I can't disclose that.

40:01.691 --> 40:04.193
But I'll tell you
what I'm willing to do for him.

40:04.902 --> 40:08.989
I'll assemble all the resources
my organization has to offer.

40:09.699 --> 40:11.576
You remember the last time

40:11.659 --> 40:15.788
all the fingers of the Hand came together,
don't you, Stick?

40:17.039 --> 40:19.249
-A goddamn culling.
-Hmm.

40:20.960 --> 40:24.630
And New York is so densely populated.

40:25.214 --> 40:26.799
What are you talking about doing?

40:28.175 --> 40:32.304
Think of how many lives you can save
if you just come with me.

40:33.473 --> 40:34.474
What do you want?

40:35.224 --> 40:38.268
Kid, don't even think about it.

40:38.352 --> 40:39.562
I just want an answer.

40:40.229 --> 40:42.272
I might even let them go free.

40:43.190 --> 40:44.609
You walk with her...

40:45.400 --> 40:47.319
and I'll take you out myself.

40:47.402 --> 40:49.363
I'm not going anywhere.

40:49.989 --> 40:51.115
Mr. Rand...

40:52.116 --> 40:53.743
you need to think this through.

40:54.910 --> 40:56.537
And you need to leave.

40:57.788 --> 40:59.039
Now.

41:09.174 --> 41:10.175
[scoffs]

41:12.386 --> 41:14.847
Oh, they're just like you, old man.

41:14.930 --> 41:18.100
The only language they speak is violence.

41:18.183 --> 41:19.894
[blade scraping]

41:44.627 --> 41:46.128
Go on, my child.

41:47.254 --> 41:48.714
Serve life itself.

42:09.359 --> 42:11.195
[tires screeching]

42:12.822 --> 42:14.532
[grunts]

42:34.343 --> 42:36.220
[sighs] Who missed me?
