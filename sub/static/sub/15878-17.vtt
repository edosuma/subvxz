00:04.404 --> 00:05.928
Hi, Kerry.

00:06.606 --> 00:09.097
- Oh, hi, Jason.
- Hi, Mrs. Hennessy.

00:09.175 --> 00:12.838
Well... Kerry?

00:17.217 --> 00:19.583
So I thought
you and Jason broke it off.

00:19.686 --> 00:23.053
We did, but Mr. Reynolds teamed us up
to work on this history project.

00:23.123 --> 00:26.559
Ah... So I guess "on-again, off-again"
is on again.

00:28.094 --> 00:29.186
Sounds like fate.

00:29.262 --> 00:32.095
Sounds like his name
follows mine alphabetically.

00:32.966 --> 00:34.524
But we'll see.

00:35.268 --> 00:37.236
- What's that?
- Mount Vesuvius.

00:37.303 --> 00:39.328
We're trying to show how its eruption

00:39.406 --> 00:43.240
helped preserve the Pompeian culture
for future generations to study.

00:45.045 --> 00:47.570
You know what? You could
melt some of my army men

00:47.647 --> 00:49.615
to look like the slower villagers.

00:52.452 --> 00:53.510
I like it.

00:54.120 --> 00:57.089
You're in luck. I was just
going upstairs to melt some.

00:58.858 --> 01:01.622
You know, if the FBI
is looking through our trash,

01:01.728 --> 01:03.195
he'll be the reason.

01:03.897 --> 01:05.865
That's funny, Mrs. Hennessy.

01:07.600 --> 01:09.067
Well, thanks, Jason.

01:11.805 --> 01:14.968
I like your mom.
She's nice, pretty, smart.

01:15.608 --> 01:17.075
What did you say?

01:18.878 --> 01:22.837
Um... Your mom was nice and smart.

01:23.750 --> 01:27.117
And pretty.
You said my mom was pretty.

01:27.220 --> 01:29.780
You never said I was pretty
when we were dating.

01:31.291 --> 01:33.259
I thought it was implied.

01:34.561 --> 01:36.927
Because you are, real pretty.

01:37.030 --> 01:39.362
- As pretty as my mom?
- Well, yeah.

01:39.432 --> 01:40.729
Wrong answer!

01:41.901 --> 01:44.802
So what, you're gonna say
my mom is pretty and then leave?

01:44.871 --> 01:46.771
Yeah.

01:46.840 --> 01:49.172
Hey, Care Bear, seems like old times.

01:49.242 --> 01:51.369
I come into a room, Jason runs out.

01:51.444 --> 01:53.605
- Yeah.
- Don't you look pretty today?

01:53.680 --> 01:55.011
Stay out of my life.

01:56.116 --> 01:57.777
Yeah, seems like old times.

01:59.000 --> 02:05.074

02:18.738 --> 02:21.104
- Hey, Bridget up yet?
- No.

02:21.207 --> 02:23.232
She was out all night
at a concert again.

02:23.309 --> 02:27.006
I caught her sneaking in again.
Now she's sleeping half the day again.

02:27.080 --> 02:29.241
I tell you, I'm letting her
have it this time.

02:29.315 --> 02:30.475
Hmm.

02:30.550 --> 02:33.018
Yeah, because that's a proven solution.

02:34.020 --> 02:36.989
- What, you've got a better idea?
- Well, I don't know.

02:37.056 --> 02:40.514
It just seems all this yelling
and grounding is having no impact.

02:40.593 --> 02:44.154
We need a new plan.
We need to try a gentler approach.

02:44.264 --> 02:47.358
Well, that's interesting,
but I want to yell.

02:48.501 --> 02:51.061
Maybe if I yell louder
and ground longer.

02:52.172 --> 02:54.333
Not the attitude I was looking for.

02:54.440 --> 02:57.170
How about we try working together?

02:57.243 --> 03:00.804
You know, partners.
See if we can't win one this time.

03:00.880 --> 03:02.313
It'd be nice to win one.

03:03.516 --> 03:08.078
- Morning. Well, technically.
- Just follow my lead.

03:08.188 --> 03:11.453
Uh, Bridget, we need
to talk to you for a second.

03:11.524 --> 03:15.221
If this is about catching me sneak in
last night, it won't happen again.

03:15.295 --> 03:18.458
Does that mean you won't sneak in,
or you won't let me catch you?

03:19.799 --> 03:22.097
Let's cross that bridge
when we come to it.

03:22.869 --> 03:26.202
Honey, it seems like you are
spending an awful lot of time

03:26.272 --> 03:28.900
hanging out with your friends
and going to clubs.

03:28.975 --> 03:32.911
Can't you find a fraction of your
free time to do something productive?

03:32.979 --> 03:35.641
I mean, really,
concerts every weekend?

03:35.715 --> 03:38.843
- But I love music.
- Well, take up an instrument.

03:38.918 --> 03:41.250
Oh, my God,
that is so amazing you just said that.

03:41.321 --> 03:44.085
I've been dreaming
of playing in an all-girl band.

03:44.657 --> 03:48.684
I've had the same dream, only in mine
you're at Harvard becoming a doctor.

03:50.230 --> 03:53.393
Last night I was with Mandy and
Courtney, who thinks she's Alias,

03:53.499 --> 03:55.990
total sophomore.
This guy with a mullet hit on me.

03:56.069 --> 04:00.165
"What's with the hair?" "Business
in the front, party in the back." Gross!

04:00.240 --> 04:04.199
- Who would have a mullet?
- Yeah, who?

04:05.245 --> 04:07.611
I was on the hockey team.
It kept my neck warm.

04:08.648 --> 04:12.675
I was listening to this incredible music
and it hit me. I want to do that.

04:12.752 --> 04:15.016
Well, then, do it.
Take up an instrument.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.851
- OK.
- That is a good plan,

04:16.923 --> 04:19.687
although I miss the instant
gratification of yelling,

04:19.791 --> 04:21.555
but I'm all for you taking up music.

04:21.661 --> 04:24.926
You know, I played
French horn in high school.

04:27.066 --> 04:29.125
Yeah, I did know that.

04:30.003 --> 04:33.461
- Honey, you pick your instrument.
- Right. Whatever you want.

04:33.539 --> 04:38.499
[loud drumming]

04:38.611 --> 04:40.374
[drumming stops]

04:42.448 --> 04:44.939
Drums? You got her drums?

04:45.018 --> 04:48.146
It was the only instrument
that came in a color she liked.

04:49.822 --> 04:53.155
Bridget sneaks in late and
you punish her by buying her stuff?

04:53.226 --> 04:56.059
Who's a guy gotta kill
to get a monkey around here?

04:56.129 --> 04:57.824
All right, Rory, that's it.

04:57.897 --> 05:00.866
That's a dollar in the
"No Talking About a Monkey" jar.

05:02.835 --> 05:05.599
# I'm playing drums
in my all-girl band

05:05.705 --> 05:08.367
# Check me out
I look so hot

05:08.441 --> 05:10.602
# You wish you were me
but you'll never be

05:10.710 --> 05:12.837
# 'Cause you're not
in an all-girl band

05:12.912 --> 05:14.072
Ha!

05:15.782 --> 05:18.046
- [giggles]
- You're an idiot.

05:19.652 --> 05:22.587
[loud drumming]

05:22.655 --> 05:24.316
[Cate sighs]

05:24.390 --> 05:26.551
- [drumming stops]
- [Cate sighs]

05:26.659 --> 05:29.321
[drumming resumes]

05:31.931 --> 05:35.059
Isn't this what they do
to drive dictators out of palaces?

05:36.336 --> 05:40.102
It's like those wind-up monkeys
that clap cymbals and bongos.

05:41.541 --> 05:44.806
And that little gem
is gonna cost you a dollar.

05:45.878 --> 05:47.436
[phone ringing]

05:47.513 --> 05:50.277
Hello. Oh, yeah, hey, Fred.

05:51.617 --> 05:53.983
You know, I've heard drumming too.

05:56.055 --> 05:58.683
Well, your leaf blower
can get pretty loud,

05:58.758 --> 06:00.919
but you don't catch me calling the cops.

06:02.228 --> 06:05.391
Really? Because they told me
it was confidential.

06:05.498 --> 06:07.966
All right, OK,
I'll see what I can do. Yeah.

06:08.034 --> 06:10.901
- [grumbling]
- [phone rings]

06:10.970 --> 06:14.497
Cate, I cannot talk to another neighbor.
Will you take this, please?

06:14.574 --> 06:17.737
If that's Jason tell him I'm studying.
Use those exact words.

06:17.810 --> 06:19.778
Got it. Hello?

06:20.713 --> 06:22.374
Oh, hey, you.

06:22.448 --> 06:25.349
[laughing]

06:25.418 --> 06:27.386
So what you been up to, stranger?

06:28.388 --> 06:32.552
Uh, Kerry?
Uh, no, Jason, she's studying.

06:34.727 --> 06:37.059
Oh, all right. I'll tell her you called.

06:41.067 --> 06:42.728
OK, bye-bye.

06:46.339 --> 06:47.704
OK, I'm gonna go jam.

06:47.807 --> 06:50.537
Oh, Beach, before you do,
I need to talk to you, honey.

06:50.610 --> 06:53.670
Your mother and I are so proud

06:53.746 --> 06:57.011
that you're showing such
enthusiasm about music.

06:57.083 --> 07:01.213
- I like to hit the drums hard.
- Sort of picked up on that.

07:01.287 --> 07:04.256
But have you ever considered
letting someone,

07:04.357 --> 07:06.689
you know, show you how to...

07:06.759 --> 07:08.852
...you know, play?

07:08.928 --> 07:11.761
I don't want to take lessons.
That's why I picked drums.

07:11.831 --> 07:15.164
I want to help you get closer
to that all-girl band dream of yours...

07:15.234 --> 07:16.861
...and mine.
- [doorbell rings]

07:16.936 --> 07:20.565
- So I hired you a drum teacher.
- Dad, I don't want a teacher.

07:20.640 --> 07:22.608
I already know what I'm doing.

07:27.780 --> 07:30.146
- I'm Ben, the drum teacher.
- Hi, Ben.

07:30.550 --> 07:32.643
Thank you, Daddy.

07:34.253 --> 07:36.380
[drumming]

07:36.456 --> 07:39.016
Wow, is that Bridget?
I'm really impressed.

07:39.125 --> 07:40.888
No, that's Ben, her teacher.

07:40.993 --> 07:43.257
[bad drumming]

07:43.329 --> 07:44.591
That's Bridget.

07:45.798 --> 07:48.665
You know, I was worried
about that guy at first. Now...

07:48.734 --> 07:53.103
This guy is a professional.
Your plan really worked out great, Cate.

07:53.172 --> 07:55.333
- Our plan. Partner.
- Partner.

07:56.342 --> 07:58.003
You know, you've really grown.

07:58.077 --> 08:00.511
I never thought I'd see the day
when you'd be OK

08:00.580 --> 08:03.276
with your daughter being alone
with a musician.

08:05.685 --> 08:08.051
Why is it we always go for the musician?

08:09.155 --> 08:12.215
That's right, your
high school boyfriend Rick.

08:13.359 --> 08:14.917
He thought he was so hot

08:15.027 --> 08:18.554
because he jammed one time
with The Monkees at some state fair.

08:19.165 --> 08:20.632
Not now!

08:22.368 --> 08:25.895
Paul, calm down.
That's why I'm with you.

08:25.972 --> 08:28.907
Writers are sexier. Much sexier.

08:28.975 --> 08:31.705
Why, your column
on treasures in the attic...

08:31.777 --> 08:32.835
Whoo!

08:33.712 --> 08:35.270
Get a hold of yourself.

08:36.115 --> 08:39.846
There's nothing going on out there
in the garage, just playing drums.

08:39.919 --> 08:42.443
- [bad drumming]
- There goes Bridget.

08:42.522 --> 08:45.082
- [good drumming]
- That's Ben.

08:45.191 --> 08:46.954
[drumming stops]

08:50.129 --> 08:52.654
That's quiet. Why is it quiet?

08:52.732 --> 08:54.393
Why is it quiet?

08:56.102 --> 08:57.467
Oh, hi, guys.

08:58.337 --> 08:59.861
Cate... Look at that.

08:59.939 --> 09:02.806
Cate, the door doesn't stick anymore.
I fixed it.

09:04.243 --> 09:07.804
- [Cate] What are you talking about?
- You're welcome. So, uh...

09:07.880 --> 09:10.644
...how's the lesson going?
- Great. Just great.

09:11.751 --> 09:14.117
OK, let's show your dad
what I taught you.

09:14.220 --> 09:15.187
OK.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.427
You are a miracle worker.

09:25.231 --> 09:27.358
That was close.
Let me show you again.

09:28.701 --> 09:31.534
Oh, excuse me. [giggles]

09:36.375 --> 09:38.935
And then, pretty soon
you'll be able to do this.

09:43.783 --> 09:45.114
[Paul] Oh, whoa!

09:45.184 --> 09:47.880
That's... That's very sophisticated.

09:47.954 --> 09:51.390
Well, Ben is a very
sophisticated guy, Dad.

09:51.457 --> 09:54.324
Hey, I won a hat!

09:56.195 --> 09:59.358
- Oh, no, I didn't.
- Sorry, excuse me, take that with you.

09:59.465 --> 10:03.401
You know what? We really appreciate
the lesson. We have your number.

10:03.469 --> 10:06.097
- Bye, Bridget.
- Bye, Ben. See you next Saturday.

10:06.172 --> 10:08.697
Wait, you scheduled
another lesson with him?

10:08.774 --> 10:09.798
Actually ten.

10:09.875 --> 10:11.740
- Ten?
- It's cheaper that way.

10:11.811 --> 10:14.541
- So how'd it go?
- Oh, my God, Ben is so great, Mom.

10:14.614 --> 10:17.082
You should see him play.
His hands are a blur.

10:18.351 --> 10:19.682
Been there.

10:20.453 --> 10:23.286
Thank you so much
for setting us up, Daddy.

10:23.356 --> 10:26.120
- I wouldn't actually call it a setup.
- I just love him!

10:26.225 --> 10:28.523
You... You mean as a teacher, right?

10:28.594 --> 10:30.323
As a teacher, right?

10:33.699 --> 10:36.065
[drumming]

10:36.168 --> 10:38.728
You still hear the fox
you let into our henhouse?

10:38.838 --> 10:42.001
- You made her take lessons.
- You told her to take up music.

10:42.108 --> 10:44.440
- You bought her drums.
- I wanted to yell at her.

10:44.510 --> 10:48.571
Stop it! It upsets me
when you two fight.

10:50.016 --> 10:51.745
- Can I get a monkey?
- No!

10:51.817 --> 10:53.682
[doorbell rings]

10:53.753 --> 10:55.414
I got it.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.682
Jason. What are you doing here?

10:59.759 --> 11:03.126
Well, I've tried calling, but
it's like you're always studying.

11:03.195 --> 11:04.958
Jason.

11:05.731 --> 11:07.995
- Oh, God.
- Hello, Mrs. Hennessy.

11:08.668 --> 11:12.104
I just came by to tell Kerry
we got an A on our Mount Vesuvius.

11:12.171 --> 11:15.140
What'd they say
about the melted villagers?

11:15.207 --> 11:17.767
That we have to talk
to the school psychologist.

11:21.247 --> 11:23.545
- Your mom's got a great laugh.
- Get out!

11:27.353 --> 11:29.617
Paul, do you like my laugh?

11:29.689 --> 11:33.819
Daddy, Ben's in a band playing tonight.
He invited me to come along.

11:33.893 --> 11:35.520
- No.
- [Cate laughing]

11:39.765 --> 11:42.325
Oh, I'm sorry, I just wanted to hear it.

11:44.103 --> 11:47.561
Bridget, you know you cannot date
college boys. Absolutely not!

11:47.640 --> 11:50.609
You don't even know him!
You're so closed-minded! God!

11:51.777 --> 11:54.541
- What, you think I'm wrong about this?
- No, no, no.

11:54.647 --> 11:57.172
It's just a very delicate situation.

11:57.249 --> 12:01.117
This is Bridget's first older man,
and it's a musician.

12:01.187 --> 12:02.745
They're intoxicating.

12:02.855 --> 12:05.983
Very, very intoxicating. Trust me.

12:07.059 --> 12:09.527
I want to see your
high school yearbooks.

12:09.595 --> 12:12.758
I want to see if I'm better-looking
than your precious Rick.

12:13.999 --> 12:18.026
I told you I lost those yearbooks
in that fire I had right after we met.

12:18.104 --> 12:19.571
- You swear?
- Swear.

12:21.006 --> 12:24.169
Look, if we do it your way and say no,
Bridget is gonna rebel.

12:24.276 --> 12:28.212
We have to show her we're at least
open-minded by talking to Ben.

12:28.280 --> 12:29.247
And then?

12:29.348 --> 12:32.181
We tell him not to let the door
hit his ass on his way out.

12:32.251 --> 12:34.219
- Partner.
- Partner.

12:37.089 --> 12:39.853
So, just tell us a little bit
about yourself, Ben.

12:39.959 --> 12:43.725
- What college do you go to?
- Actually, I dropped out of college.

12:43.829 --> 12:46.354
You hear that, Cate?
He dropped out of college.

12:47.199 --> 12:49.827
My dad died, so I
moved back home to help Mom out.

12:49.902 --> 12:52.666
I'm trying to get enough money
so I can go back there.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.740
That's when Mom's strong enough.

12:54.807 --> 12:57.640
I see. Just to be clear,
you did drop out of college.

12:57.710 --> 12:58.972
Dad!

12:59.044 --> 13:03.913
- Uh, so, Ben, you're in a band?
- Oh, a band. Tell us about that.

13:03.983 --> 13:06.213
I bet that's all sorts of crazy fun.

13:06.285 --> 13:09.118
Last week we did a show
for the Children's Hospital.

13:09.188 --> 13:11.816
- Really?
- Yeah. You gotta give back.

13:14.460 --> 13:17.088
- Old people and animals?
- Love 'em.

13:17.163 --> 13:18.494
This is your fault.

13:19.532 --> 13:21.397
I told you he was great.

13:21.467 --> 13:23.594
OK, Ben, this is the thing.

13:24.537 --> 13:27.904
We like you. We just don't want
Bridget going out with older guys.

13:28.007 --> 13:30.840
- It's nothing personal.
- Nothing personal?!

13:30.910 --> 13:34.073
Ben is a very sensitive artist.
This will devastate him.

13:35.181 --> 13:37.649
I understand. I'll get you a T-shirt.

13:38.484 --> 13:41.749
You know, you guys are so...
I'm a small...

13:41.821 --> 13:44.187
You guys are so... I hate you.

13:50.563 --> 13:55.899
- Is that my high school yearbook?
- Yeah. Found it in the basement

13:55.968 --> 13:58.528
in the box marked
"Grandma's stuff, keep out."

13:59.638 --> 14:02.971
God, you were popular.
You're practically on every page.

14:03.042 --> 14:05.101
[sighs] A few clubs, a few friends.

14:05.177 --> 14:06.542
A date or two.

14:07.713 --> 14:09.647
Who's Rick?

14:11.584 --> 14:14.678
You had tons of boyfriends.
This is like Bridget's yearbook.

14:14.753 --> 14:18.052
- Kerry.
- Look what some of these guys wrote.

14:18.123 --> 14:21.251
- Mom, you were like a Bond girl.
- OK, all right.

14:21.327 --> 14:24.558
Now look, I don't think we need
to let your father see this.

14:24.630 --> 14:25.961
Oh, really?

14:29.735 --> 14:31.794
Damn. I guess we're getting a monkey.

14:34.006 --> 14:35.974
[drumming]

14:36.041 --> 14:37.599
Bridget's still practicing?

14:37.710 --> 14:40.873
I admire her dedication,
but is she getting worse?

14:42.681 --> 14:44.546
She's just taking out her anger.

14:44.617 --> 14:47.882
It's getting kind of late, Paul.
We ought to bring her inside.

14:47.953 --> 14:50.285
Better she's angry out there
than in here.

14:50.890 --> 14:53.256
- I'll give her till Fred calls.
- [phone rings]

14:53.359 --> 14:56.328
- I'm up.
- All right. Just don't yell at her.

15:01.166 --> 15:03.327
- Hey!
- Rory?

15:04.436 --> 15:06.904
- Oh. Hey.
- Where's Bridget?

15:06.972 --> 15:08.496
I can't tell you.

15:08.574 --> 15:11.202
Rory, we don't keep secrets
in this family.

15:11.277 --> 15:14.838
OK. Mom's got yearbooks.

15:19.952 --> 15:22.182
Oh, you mean Bridget.

15:23.188 --> 15:25.952
She snuck off to see
Ben's concert. I'm her decoy.

15:28.594 --> 15:30.323
I knew you had yearbooks.

15:32.932 --> 15:36.265
You can stop building
that little monkey bed right now!

15:38.737 --> 15:42.070
Can you believe Dad? He shows up
at the club, walks in like this,

15:42.141 --> 15:45.702
and then he comes in and grabs me
before I can even see Ben.

15:45.811 --> 15:48.177
Dad? Mom. Mom is unbelievable.

15:48.280 --> 15:50.544
She's totally been flirting with Jason.

15:50.983 --> 15:53.247
Did you know Mom
was popular in high school?

15:54.053 --> 15:58.080
- She dated a musician.
- Oh, really?

15:58.157 --> 16:00.523
Maybe he's my real father.

16:02.561 --> 16:04.085
Yeah, that was my point.

16:06.231 --> 16:09.496
Huh. So he's a couple years older.
What's the big deal?

16:09.568 --> 16:12.935
What if Ben and I are destined
to be together? What if he's the one?

16:13.038 --> 16:14.801
- The one?
- Yeah.

16:14.907 --> 16:17.842
You've never had a one.
Last summer you were down to three.

16:17.910 --> 16:21.869
Kerry, Ben is my first
not-a-high-school guy.

16:21.981 --> 16:24.950
I mean, he's so experienced and worldly.

16:25.050 --> 16:27.018
He's been to Hawaii. Hawaii!

16:27.987 --> 16:30.649
He can vote. He told me
he didn't, but he can vote.

16:30.723 --> 16:33.692
And he can buy beer in Canada.

16:35.461 --> 16:38.328
You're right. You should marry him.

16:38.397 --> 16:41.457
You could honeymoon in Hawaii. Hawaii!

16:42.534 --> 16:44.297
You are so still in high school.

16:44.403 --> 16:48.669
It's just, when Ben looks at me,
it's like I'm the only one in the room.

16:48.741 --> 16:52.472
It's a private lesson in our garage.
You are the only one in the room.

16:53.278 --> 16:56.008
I'm gonna go play bad
so Dad doubles my lessons.

16:56.081 --> 16:59.050
- OK. Hey, if you see Mom...
- I know. You're studying.

16:59.151 --> 17:01.119
And you are staying home.

17:02.287 --> 17:04.550
- Can we talk?
- What's to talk about?

17:04.623 --> 17:06.590
You have nothing to apologize for.

17:06.692 --> 17:10.150
- I didn't come in here to apologize.
- How can you not apologize?

17:11.763 --> 17:15.494
Look, Jason said I was pretty.

17:15.567 --> 17:18.900
It was very nice to hear on a day
that I worked and made dinner

17:18.971 --> 17:22.338
and did ten loads of laundry. So sue me.

17:22.407 --> 17:25.343
Isn't it bad enough that
I have to compete with Bridget?

17:25.411 --> 17:27.378
Now I have to compete with you too?

17:28.914 --> 17:32.281
[sighs] Wait a minute.
Honey, what's going on here?

17:33.519 --> 17:35.578
He said I was Mom-pretty.

17:36.455 --> 17:39.390
You are a beautiful teenage girl.

17:40.759 --> 17:43.319
You think this is some kind
of competition?

17:43.395 --> 17:45.420
Yeah! And I'm losing.

17:46.932 --> 17:49.901
You know, guys don't notice me
when Bridget is around.

17:49.968 --> 17:54.132
And Rory gets all this attention
because he's the boy and the youngest.

17:54.206 --> 17:55.537
And now...

17:56.608 --> 17:58.576
[sobbing] It's like I'm invisible.

18:01.747 --> 18:03.112
Not to me.

18:04.216 --> 18:05.877
I see you.

18:05.951 --> 18:09.409
Right. Kerry, the moody middle child.

18:10.789 --> 18:12.279
Well...

18:13.425 --> 18:14.551
...yeah.

18:16.762 --> 18:22.632
Who also happens to be
sensitive and caring and fantastic.

18:23.435 --> 18:28.395
Oh, Kerry, honey, you make me feel
so privileged to be your mother.

18:28.474 --> 18:31.637
You have to say that.
It's in the manual or something.

18:33.178 --> 18:36.147
You think if it was in the manual
I'd go through all this?

18:36.782 --> 18:39.114
Ah, there you are.

18:40.185 --> 18:43.416
See? You're not invisible.

18:44.957 --> 18:49.724
Kerry, if you weren't my daughter,
I'd want you to be my friend.

18:50.562 --> 18:53.531
Yeah, right, you're not cool enough
to hang out with me.

18:54.133 --> 18:57.796
I know. That's why I spend
so much time with your father.

19:02.674 --> 19:04.141
- [drumming]
- Yeah, I know.

19:04.209 --> 19:07.178
Trust me, Fred,
it sounds a lot louder over here.

19:09.348 --> 19:11.111
So what do you think?

19:12.217 --> 19:15.277
- I'm sorry this is our last lesson.
- What?

19:15.354 --> 19:17.413
Yeah. The coolest thing happened.

19:17.489 --> 19:20.117
I'm going back to Ohio State.

19:20.192 --> 19:23.093
My dad's old company
came through with a scholarship.

19:23.162 --> 19:26.825
- I can enroll this semester.
- But... what about us?

19:26.899 --> 19:28.560
I mean, our lessons.

19:29.735 --> 19:33.694
I'll keep in touch.
I want to know how you're doing.

19:33.772 --> 19:35.239
OK?

19:43.849 --> 19:44.975
Whoa.

19:46.451 --> 19:49.011
OK. Um...

19:49.121 --> 19:50.645
Bye, Bridget.

19:55.093 --> 19:56.788
So how was the lesson?

19:57.729 --> 20:00.664
Who cares?
My teacher quit, so I'm quitting too.

20:01.867 --> 20:03.835
Bridget, don't quit just because...

20:03.902 --> 20:07.201
I never want to see another musician
again in my entire life.

20:07.272 --> 20:08.705
Alrighty then.

20:13.278 --> 20:16.145
I know I'm gonna hate myself
for this, but...

20:17.282 --> 20:21.810
Beach, as much as I like
peace and quiet around here,

20:21.887 --> 20:24.048
I don't want you to give up something

20:24.156 --> 20:27.717
that you were so excited about
a couple of weeks ago.

20:28.694 --> 20:31.629
- Just think about that, will you?
- OK.

20:36.501 --> 20:40.028
- What's going on?
- Ben's going back to college.

20:41.106 --> 20:43.574
Oh, I'm sorry. Are you OK?

20:43.642 --> 20:47.601
No, I wasn't OK, but then Dad
gave me a little pep talk

20:47.713 --> 20:49.977
and told me I shouldn't
give up on stuff.

20:50.048 --> 20:53.711
For once I think he's right.
I'm not gonna give up.

20:54.720 --> 20:56.847
Ben and I belong together.

21:09.134 --> 21:11.500
Ben, this is for you.
