00:10.400 --> 00:11.833
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

00:11.833 --> 00:13.933
I'M NOT GONNA SING YOU
ANY MORE LULLABIES.

00:13.933 --> 00:16.833

00:16.833 --> 00:17.867

HOW ABOUT I CALL SANTA,

00:19.067 --> 00:22.900
TELL HIM HOW FUNNY
YOU GUYS ARE?

00:22.900 --> 00:24.100
SANTA CALLS THE EASTER BUNNY.

00:24.100 --> 00:25.133
HE CALLS THE TOOTH FAIRY.

00:25.133 --> 00:26.700
I DON'T GOT TO BUY SQUAT.

00:29.433 --> 00:30.733
- HI.

00:30.733 --> 00:31.733
- OH, MY GOD.

00:31.733 --> 00:32.967
HOW LONG WAS THIS MEETING?

00:32.967 --> 00:34.000
- OH, WELL, IT ENDED AT 8:00,

00:34.000 --> 00:36.267
BUT I STAYED AFTER
TO TALK.

00:36.267 --> 00:38.067
- YOU KNOW, HERE'S THE THING
ABOUT THE TWINS.

00:38.067 --> 00:40.633
I KNOW
THAT I'M SUPPOSED TO LOVE THEM,

00:40.633 --> 00:45.500
BUT WHY DO THEY MAKE IT
SO FREAKIN' HARD?

00:45.500 --> 00:48.300
- LISTEN, LISTEN, RAY.
IT WAS SUCH A GREAT MEETING.

00:48.300 --> 00:49.567
REMEMBER ALL THOSE IDEAS
I HAD

00:49.567 --> 00:51.067
ABOUT FUNDRAISING
AND THE READATHON?

00:51.067 --> 00:52.300
WELL, THIS IS AMAZING.

00:52.300 --> 00:53.700
I WAS TALKING,
AND ALL THESE PEOPLE

00:53.700 --> 00:55.467
WERE REALLY INTERESTED
IN WHAT I HAD TO SAY.

00:55.467 --> 00:56.800
- THE PROBLEM IS,
THE TWINS--

00:56.800 --> 00:58.233
THEY KNOW I HAVE TO LOVE THEM.

00:58.233 --> 01:00.267
THEY USE THAT LOVE AGAINST ME.

01:00.267 --> 01:02.467
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT,
I CAN'T ANYMORE.

01:02.467 --> 01:05.000
- RAY, LISTEN, ALL THESE PEOPLE
WANT ME TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.767
- WHAT PEOPLE?

01:06.767 --> 01:08.133

01:08.133 --> 01:09.367
THEY WANT ME TO RUN
FOR PRESIDENT

01:09.367 --> 01:10.733
OF THE SCHOOL GOVERNING BOARD.

01:10.733 --> 01:12.033
ISN'T THAT FANTASTIC?

01:12.033 --> 01:14.300
- WHAT?

01:16.167 --> 01:18.833
- THERE IS AN ELECTION
NEXT WEEK,

01:18.833 --> 01:21.233
AND SO FAR, BILL PARKER
IS RUNNING UNOPPOSED.

01:21.233 --> 01:22.700
- PARKER.
I HATE THAT PARKER.

01:22.700 --> 01:23.867
- WOULD YOU LISTEN?

01:23.867 --> 01:25.167

01:25.167 --> 01:26.900
- I'M GONNA DO IT, RAY.

01:26.900 --> 01:30.633
- DO WHAT?

01:30.633 --> 01:32.667

01:32.667 --> 01:36.000

- YEAH.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.167
- BUT THAT'S, LIKE,
A LOT OF MEETINGS AT NIGHT.

01:39.167 --> 01:41.567

FOR ME.

01:41.567 --> 01:43.533
LOOK, I'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS,

01:43.533 --> 01:45.067
SOMETHING TO GET INVOLVED IN,

01:45.067 --> 01:46.533
SOMETHING WHERE I CAN
MAKE A DIFFERENCE

01:46.533 --> 01:48.067
AND USE MY BRAIN
AND HELP PEOPLE.

01:48.067 --> 01:49.700
LISTEN, I COULD MAKE
A REALLY GOOD PRESIDENT.

01:49.700 --> 01:52.933
- YEAH, BUT YOU'RE ALREADY
PRESIDENT OF THIS HOUSE.

01:52.933 --> 01:54.167
WE NEED YOU.

01:54.167 --> 01:58.467
ASK NOT WHAT YOUR HOUSE
CAN DO FOR YOU.

01:58.467 --> 02:00.267
- TOMORROW NIGHT,
I WANT YOU TO COME WITH ME.

02:00.267 --> 02:02.133
THERE'S A POTLUCK DINNER
WHERE ALL THE PARENTS

02:02.133 --> 02:03.667
GET TO MEET THE PEOPLE
RUNNING FOR OFFICE.

02:03.667 --> 02:07.300
- NO, NO, I'M NOT CRAZY
ABOUT PEOPLE.

02:07.300 --> 02:10.133
- ARE YOU CRAZY ABOUT ME?

02:22.333 --> 02:25.433
- OH, BOY.
HERE WE ARE.

02:26.933 --> 02:28.100
YOU KNOW, I'VE NEVER BEEN

02:28.100 --> 02:30.200
TO A POLITICAL CONVENTION
BEFORE.

02:30.200 --> 02:31.800
WHERE ARE THE HOOKERS?

02:31.800 --> 02:32.833
- RAY.

02:32.833 --> 02:34.500
LISTEN, DO ME A FAVOR TONIGHT.

02:34.500 --> 02:36.433
TRY NOT TO LET EVERYTHING
THAT'S IN HERE COME OUT HERE.

02:36.433 --> 02:37.633
COULD YOU DO THAT FOR ME?

02:37.633 --> 02:38.433
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

02:38.433 --> 02:39.667
HEY, LET'S PRETEND

02:39.667 --> 02:41.200
I'M YOUR SECRET SERVICE
AGENT MAN,

02:42.767 --> 02:44.400
SHE'S ON THE MOVE.

02:45.800 --> 02:47.400
- I HAVE A BETTER IDEA.

02:47.400 --> 02:49.233
WHY DON'T YOU PRETEND
YOU'RE HERE UNDERCOVER

02:49.233 --> 02:51.133
AS AN ADULT?

02:52.333 --> 02:53.633
- ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S IT.

02:53.633 --> 02:55.233
I'M CHANGING
MY CODE NAME FOR YOU.

02:55.233 --> 02:56.967
IT USED TO BE "HOT MAMA."

02:56.967 --> 02:58.733
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT IT IS NOW?

02:58.733 --> 03:00.733

03:00.733 --> 03:01.800

GOOD LUCK, AND, UH,

03:37.067 --> 03:39.167

03:39.167 --> 03:40.700

03:40.700 --> 03:42.767
[laughter]

03:42.767 --> 03:45.133

03:46.333 --> 03:48.100

03:51.767 --> 03:53.167

THAT GUY--
HE'S ALL WITH THE BLOND HAIR

03:55.200 --> 03:56.600

03:58.200 --> 04:00.633
WE GOT IT.

- GOD.

04:13.500 --> 04:14.467
WHY?

04:14.467 --> 04:15.967
- YOUR APPEARANCE
REFLECTS ON ME.

04:15.967 --> 04:17.567
LOOK HOW CARRIE PARKER
IS DRESSED.

04:17.567 --> 04:22.233
- SORRY, I DIDN'T KNOW
I WAS GONNA BE FIRST LADY.

04:22.233 --> 04:25.633

HI, MAUREEN.

04:47.100 --> 04:48.167

04:48.167 --> 04:50.500
OH, THESE PEOPLE

04:51.833 --> 04:53.800
LOOK AT THIS.
CRACKERS.

04:53.800 --> 04:55.000
- YEAH.

04:56.133 --> 04:57.867
- WHAT'S THIS?
- TABBOULEH.

04:57.867 --> 05:00.400
- I GOT TO TELL YOU,
IF I SAW THIS ON THE FLOOR,

05:00.400 --> 05:02.400
I'D RUB MY DOG'S NOSE IN IT.

05:04.633 --> 05:07.000
- I MADE THE TABBOULEH.

05:09.167 --> 05:11.100
- HI.
I'M BILL PARKER.

05:20.667 --> 05:22.433
I HATE THIS.

05:22.433 --> 05:24.300
- HEY, I'M WITH YOU.

05:24.300 --> 05:26.267
THESE POTLUCKS--
THEY'RE ALWAYS LAME.

05:26.267 --> 05:27.933
THAT'S WHY WHEN I SEE
THE ONE GOOD THING,

05:27.933 --> 05:29.133
I STOCK UP.

05:29.133 --> 05:30.333
- WHAT'S THAT,
THE TENDERLOIN?

05:30.333 --> 05:32.567
- YOU KNOW IT.
- MM-HMM.

05:32.567 --> 05:33.767
- YOU WANT A BITE?

05:33.767 --> 05:35.600
- NO. YEAH.
THAT'S NICE OF YOU, THOUGH.

05:35.600 --> 05:37.833
THANK YOU.

05:37.833 --> 05:39.700
SO WHO YOU THINK'S
GONNA BE PRESIDENT?

05:39.700 --> 05:41.267
- OH, IT'S A TOSS-UP.

05:41.267 --> 05:42.733
BILL PARKER
SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD,

05:42.733 --> 05:45.067
BUT I'LL PROBABLY VOTE
FOR THAT DEBRA BARONE.

05:45.067 --> 05:46.500
- OH, YEAH?
WHY IS THAT?

05:46.500 --> 05:48.367
- SHE'S GOT
A NICE LITTLE CABOOSE.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.133
- ALL RIGHT,
ATTENTION, EVERYBODY.

06:00.133 --> 06:01.800
WOULD YOU ALL
GATHER OVER HERE, PLEASE?

06:01.800 --> 06:03.900
WE'D LIKE TO GET STARTED.

06:03.900 --> 06:06.700
- TENDERLOIN.
EXCELLENT.

06:08.800 --> 06:11.800
- UH, EXCUSE ME.

06:11.800 --> 06:13.667
EXCUSE ME.
CAN WE HAVE EVERYBODY, PLEASE?

06:19.633 --> 06:21.467
EVERYONE?

07:08.733 --> 07:11.900
- DADDY!
- GO TO SLEEP!

07:11.900 --> 07:14.067
- I WANT WATER!

07:14.067 --> 07:15.733
- NO! NO!

07:15.733 --> 07:18.000
FIRST IT'S WATER,
THEN, "READ ME A STORY,"

07:18.000 --> 07:19.400
THEN I FALL ASLEEP
UP THERE,

07:19.400 --> 07:21.133
AND YOU'RE DOWN HERE
WATCHING WRESTLING!

07:21.133 --> 07:23.167
NO!
NO WATER!

07:23.167 --> 07:25.800
- YES! YES!
- ALL RIGHT!

07:25.800 --> 07:27.033
- WHAT--WHAT HAPPENED?

07:27.033 --> 07:29.467
- THEY PULLED IT OUT!
THE KNICKS WON!

07:29.467 --> 07:30.600
THE KNICKS WON!

07:30.600 --> 07:32.500
- INCREDIBLE GAME!

07:32.500 --> 07:35.300
KNICKS WERE DOWN 14
WITH 3 MINUTES LEFT.

07:35.300 --> 07:37.167
- AND THEN SPREWELL MAKES
A GAME-WINNING SHOT

07:37.167 --> 07:38.433
FROM 30 FEET OUT
AT THE BUZZER.

07:38.433 --> 07:40.000
IT WAS THE BEST GAME
OF THE YEAR.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.133
- OH, MAN!

07:41.133 --> 07:43.733
- AND YOU MISSED IT.

07:45.700 --> 07:47.633
- COME ON!

07:47.633 --> 07:48.633
- TOUGH BREAK, CUBBY.

07:48.633 --> 07:51.000
[laughs]

07:51.000 --> 07:53.033
- HELLO, RAYMOND.

07:53.033 --> 07:54.333
- MA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

07:54.333 --> 07:55.800
- I'M TAKING WATER
TO THE CHILDREN.

07:55.800 --> 07:58.300
- I SAID NO MORE WATER!

07:58.300 --> 07:59.800
- ALL RIGHT, RAYMOND.

07:59.800 --> 08:03.967
BUT I WOULD NEVER
DENY MY CHILDREN WATER.

08:03.967 --> 08:05.900
- WELL, ROBERT,
I GUESS THAT EXPLAINS

08:05.900 --> 08:07.767
YOUR BED-WETTING PROBLEM.

08:14.267 --> 08:16.400
- YOU KNOW, RAYMOND,
TO TELL THE TRUTH,

08:16.400 --> 08:18.367
DEBRA SHOULD HAVE
PUT THEM TO BED BEFORE SHE LEFT.

08:18.367 --> 08:19.633
- YEAH, WELL, TELL HER THAT.

08:19.633 --> 08:23.000
NO, NO, NO,
DON'T TELL HER THAT.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.433
- WHEN IS SHE GETTING HOME?

08:24.433 --> 08:25.867
- WHEN THEY COUNT
ALL THE VOTES.

08:25.867 --> 08:27.400
- I DON'T KNOW
WHY YOU'RE LETTING HER

08:27.400 --> 08:29.033
WASTE HER TIME
WITH THIS CRAP.

08:29.033 --> 08:31.067
- NO, NO, NO.
DEBRA'S RIGHT.

08:31.067 --> 08:32.700
SHE SAID IT'S IMPORTANT

08:32.700 --> 08:35.133
FOR PARENTS TO GET INVOLVED
IN THEIR KIDS' EDUCATION.

08:35.133 --> 08:38.567
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH,
BLAH, BLAH.

08:38.567 --> 08:41.900
- WE NEVER GOT INVOLVED
IN YOUR EDUCATION.

08:41.900 --> 08:43.533
- THAT'S RIGHT.

08:43.533 --> 08:46.700
PA DIDN'T GO IN FOR ALL THAT
FANCY BOOK-LEARNIN'.

08:51.400 --> 08:54.667
- WHAT?
WHAT DID I PAY TAXES FOR?

08:54.667 --> 08:55.700
YOU THINK I HAD TIME

08:55.700 --> 08:57.433
TO TELL YOU
WHAT TWO PLUS TWO IS?

08:57.433 --> 08:59.100
- WELL, MAYBE
IF YOU TOOK MORE INTEREST,

08:59.100 --> 09:00.867
WHO KNOWS HOW FAR
I COULD HAVE GONE?

09:00.867 --> 09:03.133
- FOUR!

09:04.667 --> 09:07.100
TWO PLUS TWO IS FOUR!

09:07.100 --> 09:09.500
GO GET 'EM, TIGER!

09:12.600 --> 09:15.367
- WELL, I THINK IT'S GREAT,
WHAT DEBRA'S DOING.

09:15.367 --> 09:17.067
- YOU THINK EVERYTHING SHE DOES
IS GREAT.

09:17.067 --> 09:18.133
- NOT EVERYTHING.

09:18.133 --> 09:19.767
I THINK SHE'S A BAD MARRIER.

09:21.333 --> 09:23.400
- HI.
- HERE SHE IS!

09:23.400 --> 09:25.167
[hums "Hail to the Chief"]

09:25.167 --> 09:26.167
- I LOST.

09:26.167 --> 09:29.900
- [slows humming]

09:29.900 --> 09:32.467
- NO, THAT'S THE WAY IT GOES.

10:15.200 --> 10:17.600
- MY CELL PHONE
WAS IN MY POCKET.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.033
- LOST?
- YUP.

10:28.033 --> 10:29.300
BILL PARKER IS THE NEW

10:29.300 --> 10:30.867
OUR LADY OF FAITH
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

10:30.867 --> 10:32.567
GOVERNING BOARD PRESIDENT.

10:32.567 --> 10:35.233
- OH, WOW, DEB, I'M SORRY.
THAT STINKS.

10:35.233 --> 10:37.633
- STINKS?
IT'S AN OUTRAGE.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.333
YOU WERE BORN TO BE

10:40.333 --> 10:42.000
THE OUR LADY OF FAITH
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

10:42.000 --> 10:43.500
GOVERNING BOARD PRESIDENT.

10:44.633 --> 10:46.367
- I DON'T KNOW.

10:46.367 --> 10:48.267
MAYBE I JUST HAD
TOO MANY IDEAS.

10:48.267 --> 10:50.800
MAYBE I TALKED TOO MUCH.
DID I COME OFF PUSHY?

10:50.800 --> 10:51.867
- NO.

10:51.867 --> 10:53.200
COME ON, DEB.

10:53.200 --> 10:55.200
PARKER BOUGHT
THAT WHOLE ELECTION, HUH?

10:55.200 --> 10:56.500
PUTTING OUT THE TENDERLOIN

10:56.500 --> 10:59.200
AND THE HORSERADISH
AND THE ROLLS.

10:59.200 --> 11:00.800
HOW COULD YOU COMPETE
WITH THAT?

11:00.800 --> 11:01.867
- HMM.

11:01.867 --> 11:04.767
THAT'S TOUGH TO BEAT.

11:04.767 --> 11:07.067
- FOOD'S IMPORTANT, DEAR.

11:07.067 --> 11:10.000
IF YOU HAD ONLY COME TO ME.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.100
- COME ON.

11:11.100 --> 11:12.433
THAT HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH IT.

11:12.433 --> 11:15.200
- DON'T KID YOURSELF,
SWEETHEART.

11:15.200 --> 11:17.900
THIS IS POLITICS.

11:17.900 --> 11:19.533
YOU GOT TO PLAY ROUGH.

11:19.533 --> 11:22.533
HE PUTS OUT TENDERLOIN;
YOU PUT OUT PRIME RIB.

11:24.033 --> 11:27.167
HE PUTS OUT PRIME RIB;
YOU GO LOBSTER.

11:27.167 --> 11:28.367
HE GOES LOBSTER;

11:28.367 --> 11:30.767
YOU START THE RUMOR
HE WEARS A BRA.

11:34.033 --> 11:35.500
- YEAH, I LIKE
THAT BRA THING.

11:35.500 --> 11:37.300
I'LL SAY I SAW HIM
IN THE LINGERIE DEPARTMENT

11:37.300 --> 11:40.133
GOING INTO THE FITTING ROOM.

11:40.133 --> 11:42.100
- WHY DON'T YOU
DEMAND A RECOUNT?

11:42.100 --> 11:43.433
MAYBE THERE WAS
SOME FUNNY BUSINESS

11:43.433 --> 11:44.433
GOING ON WITH THE BALLOTS.

11:44.433 --> 11:46.433
- NO.
- THAT GOES ON.

11:46.433 --> 11:48.433
- MRS. WENDELL, THE LIBRARIAN--
SHE WAS KEEPING

11:48.433 --> 11:50.800
A PRETTY CLOSE WATCH
ON THE SHOEBOXES.

11:50.800 --> 11:51.900
- OH, MRS. WENDELL.

11:51.900 --> 11:53.267
I REMEMBER HER.

11:53.267 --> 11:56.333
"THE BOOKS ARE LATE!
THE BOOKS ARE LATE!"

12:02.400 --> 12:05.400
- YOU KNOW, I THINK
WHAT'S REALLY BUGGING ME IS,

12:05.400 --> 12:07.267
I THOUGHT I HAD THE SUPPORT.

12:07.267 --> 12:09.233
I THOUGHT PEOPLE LIKED ME.

12:09.233 --> 12:12.300
- PEOPLE CAN FOOL YOU.

12:15.833 --> 12:18.267
- COME ON, I MEAN,
JUST BECAUSE YOU LOST

12:18.267 --> 12:20.167
DOESN'T MEAN
PEOPLE DON'T LIKE YOU, RIGHT?

12:20.167 --> 12:21.367
I'M SURE YOU GOT
A LOT OF VOTES.

12:21.367 --> 12:23.000
- YEAH, WELL,
IT WAS VERY CLOSE.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.167
- SURE.

12:24.167 --> 12:25.733
BY THE WAY,
HOW CLOSE WAS IT?

12:25.733 --> 12:28.500
- SIX VOTES.
- SEE?

12:28.500 --> 12:32.067
SO IT'S NOT LIKE YOU LOST
BY ONE VOTE.

12:32.067 --> 12:33.733
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

12:33.733 --> 12:35.133
- WHAT?
NO, NOTHING.

12:35.133 --> 12:36.867
- WAIT, YOU THINK IT'S GOOD
THAT I LOST

12:36.867 --> 12:38.500
BY MORE THAN ONE VOTE?

12:38.500 --> 12:40.267
- NO.

12:40.267 --> 12:41.467
I MEAN, WELL, KIND OF.

12:41.467 --> 12:43.000
ONLY BECAUSE
IF YOU LOST BY ONE VOTE,

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
THEN THAT WOULD BE
HEARTBREAKING.

12:51.400 --> 12:53.567
- YES, IT WOULD BE
HEARTBREAKING.

12:54.767 --> 12:56.733
RAY, WHO DID YOU VOTE FOR?

13:05.200 --> 13:08.100
RAY?
- WHAT?

13:08.100 --> 13:09.833
WHAT?

13:09.833 --> 13:11.500
- WHO DID YOU VOTE FOR?

13:17.000 --> 13:18.600
- [sighs]

13:23.000 --> 13:24.267
- OH, BOY.

13:25.667 --> 13:26.733
- WE SHOULD GO.

13:26.733 --> 13:28.267
- I'M RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

13:28.267 --> 13:29.833
- WHAT? WHAT?
WHERE YOU GOING?

13:29.833 --> 13:31.800
- IT'S NONE OF OUR BUSINESS.
- WHAT? SINCE WHEN?

13:31.800 --> 13:33.467
YOU THINK EVERYTHING'S
YOUR BUSINESS.

13:33.467 --> 13:35.233
- USUALLY I'D STAY
AND DEFEND YOU,

13:35.233 --> 13:37.700
BUT VOTING
AGAINST YOUR WIFE?

13:37.700 --> 13:39.367
- YOU'RE A DEAD MAN.

13:44.500 --> 13:48.700
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY,
BUT, DEB, IF YOU WANT TO TALK...

13:48.700 --> 13:49.733
AND YOU...

14:13.867 --> 14:16.733
- YOU KNOW, YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO ASK PEOPLE

14:16.733 --> 14:18.200
WHO THEY VOTE FOR.

14:19.400 --> 14:20.833
THAT'S WHY
WE FOLDED OUR VOTES

14:20.833 --> 14:24.300
AND PUT IT IN THE SHOEBOX
WITH THE TAPE AROUND IT

14:24.300 --> 14:25.533
AND THEY LOCKED IT UP

14:25.533 --> 14:27.633
IN THE SCHOOL
CAFE-GYM-A-TORIUM...

14:33.200 --> 14:35.333
AS OUR FOREFATHERS DID.

14:40.267 --> 14:42.233
- HOW COULD YOU
DO THAT TO ME?

14:42.233 --> 14:44.200
- WELL, I JUST LOOKED

14:44.200 --> 14:46.067
AT WHAT BOTH CANDIDATES
BROUGHT TO THE TABLE,

14:46.067 --> 14:47.433
AND I JUST THOUGHT
THAT BILL PARKER--

14:47.433 --> 14:50.033
- BILL PARKER?
YOU HATE BILL PARKER!

14:50.033 --> 14:51.833
- I HATE BILL PARKER
THE MAN,

14:51.833 --> 14:54.900
BUT I JUST THOUGHT
THAT BILL PARKER THE CANDIDATE

14:54.900 --> 14:56.100
HAD AN INTERESTING PLATFORM.

14:56.100 --> 14:58.233
- OH, SHUT UP.
I'M YOUR WIFE.

14:58.233 --> 15:01.000
I DON'T CARE IF MY PLATFORM
WAS...ANTI-PUPPY.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.433
YOU HAVE TO VOTE FOR ME.

15:02.433 --> 15:04.067
- BUT DOESN'T IT SAY
IN THE CONSTITUTION--

15:04.067 --> 15:05.067
- I DON'T CARE WHAT IT SAYS

15:05.067 --> 15:06.133
IN THE CONSTITUTION.

15:06.133 --> 15:07.467
YOU VOTE FOR YOUR WIFE!

15:07.467 --> 15:09.033
AND SINCE WHEN DO YOU KNOW
WHAT IT SAYS

15:09.033 --> 15:11.000
IN THE CONSTITUTION?

15:13.567 --> 15:16.533
- I'M NOT GONNA STAND HERE
AND LET YOU BADMOUTH AMERICA.

15:23.367 --> 15:25.333
- YOU VOTED AGAINST ME.

15:25.333 --> 15:27.667
- I DIDN'T VOTE
AGAINST YOU.

15:27.667 --> 15:30.433
I LOVE YOU.

15:30.433 --> 15:33.700
I JUST VOTED
NOT FOR YOU.

15:33.700 --> 15:34.933
I WAS PROTECTING YOU.

15:34.933 --> 15:36.267
- PROTECTING ME FROM WHAT?

15:36.267 --> 15:37.667
- FROM POLITICAL BACKSTABBING.

15:37.667 --> 15:38.733
YOU DON'T REALIZE

15:38.733 --> 15:40.300
THAT WHEN YOU'RE
A POLITICAL FIGURE,

15:40.300 --> 15:41.567
YOU'RE AT THE MERCY
OF THE PEOPLE,

15:41.567 --> 15:43.100
AND THE PEOPLE--
THEY'RE HORRIBLE.

15:43.100 --> 15:45.100
THEY STARE
AT YOUR CABOOSE.

15:46.133 --> 15:48.433
- YOU WERE AGAINST THIS
ALL ALONG.

15:48.433 --> 15:50.567
YOU CAN'T SUPPORT ME
FOR ONE MINUTE!

15:50.567 --> 15:52.967
- OH, COME ON.
I SUPPORT YOU.

15:52.967 --> 15:54.500
WHEN YOU HAD
15 MEETINGS THIS WEEK,

15:54.500 --> 15:56.067
WHO TOOK CARE
OF THE KIDS, HUH?

15:56.067 --> 15:58.667
PUTTING THEM TO BED AND RUNNING
GALLONS OF WATER UPSTAIRS

15:58.667 --> 16:00.367
LIKE GUNGA DIN?

16:00.367 --> 16:02.100
- FIRST OF ALL,
IT WAS TWO MEETINGS,

16:02.100 --> 16:03.600
AND YOU COMPLAINED
THE WHOLE TIME.

16:03.600 --> 16:05.333
WE ALL KNOW WHY
YOU DIDN'T VOTE FOR ME, RAY.

16:05.333 --> 16:06.900
BECAUSE YOU WERE AFRAID
THAT IF I WIN,

16:06.900 --> 16:08.233
I MIGHT GET OUT OF THIS HOUSE

16:08.233 --> 16:09.600
AND YOU MIGHT
HAVE TO GET OFF YOUR BUTT

16:09.600 --> 16:11.167
ONCE IN A WHILE
AND DO SOMETHING.

16:11.167 --> 16:12.400
YOU WANT ME
LOCKED IN THIS HOUSE.

16:12.400 --> 16:14.133
YOUR VOTE WAS A VOTE
FOR SLAVERY!

16:22.333 --> 16:25.633
- I HAVE ALWAYS SPOKEN OUT
AGAINST SLAVERY.

16:25.633 --> 16:27.333
- NOT IN THIS HOUSE.
NOT IN THIS MARRIAGE.

16:27.333 --> 16:28.767
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT A MARRIAGE IS.

16:28.767 --> 16:30.833
A MARRIAGE IS TWO PEOPLE
SUPPORTING EACH OTHER

16:30.833 --> 16:32.267
NO MATTER WHAT,

16:32.267 --> 16:34.267
BEING THERE FOR EACH OTHER
FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE,

16:34.267 --> 16:35.567
STANDING NEXT TO EACH OTHER,

16:35.567 --> 16:37.367
STANDING UP FOR EACH OTHER
NO MATTER WHAT.

16:37.367 --> 16:39.467
BUT YOU DON'T GET THAT,
AND THAT'S WHY AT THAT POTLUCK,

16:39.467 --> 16:41.533
I HAD TO TELL PEOPLE
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW YOU.

16:41.533 --> 16:42.733
- WHAT?

16:42.733 --> 16:44.367
YOU TOLD PEOPLE
YOU DON'T KNOW ME?

16:44.367 --> 16:46.533
- OF COURSE.
YOU WERE ACTING LIKE A GOOFBALL.

16:46.533 --> 16:48.500
- I DON'T CARE
WHAT I WAS DOING.

16:48.500 --> 16:50.533
YOU DENIED KNOWING ME
AT THE POTLUCK?

16:50.533 --> 16:54.333
- YOU WERE STUFFING YOUR PANTS
WITH FOOD.

16:56.100 --> 16:57.900
- I'M YOUR HUSBAND.

16:57.900 --> 17:01.467
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SUPPORT ME
NO MATTER WHAT'S IN MY PANTS.

17:10.700 --> 17:13.500
HUH, DIDN'T YOU JUST SAY,
"PARTNERS FOR BETTER OR WORSE,

17:13.500 --> 17:14.800
STANDING UP ON EACH OTHER"--

17:14.800 --> 17:16.100
- OH, DON'T EVEN.

17:16.100 --> 17:17.367
IT'S NOT THE SAME THING,
AND YOU KNOW IT.

17:17.367 --> 17:18.467
YOU EMBARRASSED ME.

17:18.467 --> 17:19.900
- I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING DIFFERENT

17:19.900 --> 17:20.900
AT THAT POTLUCK THING

17:20.900 --> 17:22.200
THAT I DON'T DO

17:22.200 --> 17:24.800
AT ANY OTHER PUBLIC PLACE
YOU DRAG ME TO.

17:24.800 --> 17:28.567
I HAVE ALWAYS LIKED BEEF!

17:28.567 --> 17:31.200
AND I HAVE ALWAYS TRIED
TO GET AS MUCH OF IT AS I COULD

17:31.200 --> 17:33.133
AT ANY FUNCTION!

17:34.867 --> 17:36.267
BUT EVEN BEFORE THAT HAPPENED,

17:36.267 --> 17:38.500
YOU MADE IT VERY CLEAR
THAT I EMBARRASS YOU--

17:38.500 --> 17:40.400
GETTING UP ON ME
ABOUT SHAVING

17:40.400 --> 17:41.900
AND TELLING ME
TO STAND UP STRAIGHT

17:41.900 --> 17:43.600
AND TUCK IN MY SHIRT,

17:43.600 --> 17:46.600
LIKE--LIKE I WASN'T
GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU.

17:48.133 --> 17:51.233
AND NOW I FIND OUT
YOU ACTUALLY TOLD PEOPLE

17:51.233 --> 17:53.267
THAT YOU DON'T KNOW ME?

17:57.933 --> 18:00.167
I WOULD NEVER
DO THAT TO YOU.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.767
- I'M SORRY.

18:15.700 --> 18:16.600
- I'M SORRY, TOO.

18:16.600 --> 18:19.667
I-I SHOULD HAVE VOTED
FOR YOU.

18:19.667 --> 18:24.733
- AND I SHOULD HAVE
TOLD PEOPLE I KNOW YOU.

18:34.367 --> 18:36.967
- I WAS ACTING JERKY.

18:36.967 --> 18:39.367
- YEAH, I KNOW I--

18:39.367 --> 18:42.967
I GUESS I JUST GOT
CARRIED AWAY, YOU KNOW,

18:42.967 --> 18:44.333
WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF BEING

18:44.333 --> 18:46.333
THE OUR LADY OF FAITH
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

18:46.333 --> 18:49.467
GOVERNING BOARD PRESIDENT.

18:49.467 --> 18:50.500
- WELL, LISTEN.

18:50.500 --> 18:54.233
ALL THAT POWER--
IT'S LIKE A DRUG.

19:00.533 --> 19:01.833
- YOU WANT SOMETHING
TO EAT?

19:01.833 --> 19:03.067
- YEAH, YEAH.
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

19:03.067 --> 19:05.500
- I GOT SOME VEGGIES
AND DIP LEFT.

19:05.500 --> 19:06.667
- OH.

19:06.667 --> 19:08.433
YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD GO GOOD
WITH THAT?

19:08.433 --> 19:09.700
TABBOULEH.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.067
GOT ANY COOKIES?

19:14.067 --> 19:15.567
- COOKIES.
I GOT COOKIES.

19:15.567 --> 19:18.500
[phone rings]

19:19.767 --> 19:21.333
- HELLO.

19:21.333 --> 19:23.200
YEAH, SHE'S RIGHT HERE.

19:24.367 --> 19:26.600
IT'S THE PRESIDENT.

19:30.167 --> 19:31.200
- HI, BILL.

19:31.200 --> 19:32.267
- WHAT, DID HE CALL TO GLOAT?

19:32.267 --> 19:34.433
YOU TELL HIM WE'RE ONTO HIM.

19:36.033 --> 19:37.233
- MM-HMM.

19:37.233 --> 19:40.300
YEAH, WELL,
NO, CONGRATULATIONS.

19:40.300 --> 19:43.400
REALLY?
OH!

19:43.400 --> 19:45.033
WELL, THAT'S SO NICE
OF YOU TO SAY.

19:45.033 --> 19:46.867
YES, I WOULD LOVE
TO HELP YOU.

19:46.867 --> 19:48.633
- WHAT?
- YEAH.

19:48.633 --> 19:51.000
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
MY NIGHTS ARE MOSTLY FREE.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.500
- WHAT?
NO, THEY'RE NOT!

19:52.500 --> 19:53.567
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:53.567 --> 19:55.400
THE ONE THING
I REALLY WANTED TO DO

19:55.400 --> 19:57.300
WAS GET THOSE
TEACHERS' LUNCHEONS ORGANIZED.

19:57.300 --> 19:59.200
- HANG UP THE PHONE.
HE'S TRYING TO TEAR US APART.

19:59.200 --> 20:00.867
- AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

20:00.867 --> 20:03.967
- MOMMY, I HAD AN ACCIDENT.

20:03.967 --> 20:05.567
- ACCIDENT.
ACCIDENT.

20:07.300 --> 20:09.467
MOMMY'S ON THE PHONE.

20:09.467 --> 20:11.567
YOU WANT TO WAIT
FOR MOMMY?

20:12.733 --> 20:14.167
MOMMY, HE--

20:17.833 --> 20:19.600
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL DO IT.

20:19.600 --> 20:21.367
- BUT I WANT MOMMY.

20:21.367 --> 20:24.000
- DON'T BLAME ME.
I VOTED FOR PARKER.

20:32.767 --> 20:35.667
- SO I JUST WANT TO SAY
THAT I'M LOOKING FORWARD

20:35.667 --> 20:38.133
TO A SUCCESSFUL YEAR
OF WORKING TOGETHER,

20:38.133 --> 20:40.367
BUT I CAN ONLY DO IT
WITH YOUR HELP.

20:43.500 --> 20:46.167
I ONLY HOPE THAT I'M WORTHY

20:46.167 --> 20:47.533
OF THE FAITH
THAT YOU'VE SHOWN IN ME,

20:47.533 --> 20:50.700
BECAUSE AT OUR LADY OF FAITH,

20:50.700 --> 20:52.100
IT IS ALL ABOUT FAITH--

20:52.100 --> 20:54.200
FAITH IN OUR CHILDREN,

20:54.200 --> 20:57.300
FAITH IN OUR FACULTY,
FAITH IN EACH OTHER.

20:57.300 --> 20:59.133
- [whispers] FAITH THAT YOU
WEAR A BRA, BUDDY.

20:59.133 --> 21:01.700
- [laughing]
YEAH.

21:01.700 --> 21:04.167
- [mumbling]
