01:10.302 --> 01:11.801
<i>NORAD, this is ISS.</i>

01:11.803 --> 01:14.071
<i>We just had a close
encounter with a UAP.</i>

01:14.073 --> 01:15.606
<i>Any information on this?</i>

01:15.608 --> 01:17.008
<i>It wasn't one
of our satellites.</i>

01:17.010 --> 01:18.809
<i>I'm forwarding
this inquiry to NASA.</i>

01:18.811 --> 01:20.643
<i>This is
Dr. Linda Murphy of Langley.</i>

01:20.645 --> 01:22.713
<i>ISS was nearly hit
by a rogue satellite.</i>

01:22.715 --> 01:24.047
<i>Do you guys have
anything in that sector?</i>

01:24.049 --> 01:25.582
That's a negative, NORAD.

01:25.584 --> 01:27.750
We have no authorized air
traffic in that quadrant.

01:27.752 --> 01:31.488
You kids are always
monkeying around with something.

01:31.490 --> 01:32.722
Are you calling
to reprimand me

01:32.724 --> 01:34.392
for breaking some
Bunsen burners?

01:34.394 --> 01:37.094
Or is there another reason that
Homeland Security is calling?

01:37.096 --> 01:39.497
Oh. No.
What's your thought on this?

01:39.499 --> 01:42.565
Hard to say.
It has no organic shape to it.

01:42.567 --> 01:44.735
So it ain't a meteor?

01:44.737 --> 01:46.535
Unlikely.

01:46.537 --> 01:48.604
Possibly a satellite.

01:48.606 --> 01:49.808
What's the rate of descent?

01:52.478 --> 01:54.744
It's falling at
28,000 feet per second.

01:54.746 --> 01:55.882
28,000?

02:00.585 --> 02:02.018
ISS has visual contact.

02:02.020 --> 02:04.488
<i>It passed by
on our starboard side.</i>

02:04.490 --> 02:06.556
<i>Nearly took us out.</i>

02:06.558 --> 02:08.859
<i>Detected possible
signs of life.</i>

02:08.861 --> 02:11.160
<i>We managed to get
one picture of the object</i>

02:11.162 --> 02:12.528
<i>before it escaped our range.</i>

02:12.530 --> 02:14.564
<i>Transmitting to you now.</i>

02:14.566 --> 02:15.701
15 seconds!

02:17.101 --> 02:18.403
Stand by.

02:22.340 --> 02:23.875
Pull it up.

02:29.982 --> 02:32.182
Whoa.

02:32.184 --> 02:33.316
Dr. Reynolds?

02:33.318 --> 02:34.754
Gotta call you back!

03:48.493 --> 03:50.360
A pleasure,
as always, Dr. Murphy.

03:50.362 --> 03:51.729
But what may I ask
is so important

03:51.731 --> 03:53.563
you called an emergency
meeting at this hour?

03:53.565 --> 03:55.665
More unidentified
flying objects?

03:55.667 --> 03:56.969
Not unidentified, sir.

04:06.044 --> 04:07.611
It's the "Elbe".

04:07.613 --> 04:09.782
You can't be serious.

04:11.250 --> 04:12.818
It's the Elbe.

04:14.754 --> 04:17.190
Dr. Murphy, this is classified.

04:18.824 --> 04:20.657
It just crashed in South-
Central Chavez county,

04:20.659 --> 04:22.993
New Mexico, sir.

04:22.995 --> 04:24.697
It's not classified any longer.

04:26.397 --> 04:29.201
Chavez County. That's somewhere
near Roswell, right?

04:31.135 --> 04:33.270
What the hell
is the Elbe, Linda?

04:33.272 --> 04:35.604
A secret joint U.S.-Soviet
deep space probe

04:35.606 --> 04:37.875
launched June 17th, 1985.

04:37.877 --> 04:40.676
Hold on. But we weren't
conducting any joint missions

04:40.678 --> 04:42.479
with the Soviets
back in the '80s.

04:42.481 --> 04:44.748
That's why it's secret.

04:44.750 --> 04:47.952
April 25th, 1945, the day
Soviet and American troops

04:47.954 --> 04:49.952
met at Elbe River, Germany,

04:49.954 --> 04:51.654
an important step
toward ending the war.

04:51.656 --> 04:54.991
I'm familiar with that little
bit of history there, kiddo.

04:54.993 --> 04:57.394
Well, Bush Jr.
and Putin felt nostalgic.

04:57.396 --> 05:00.597
Yeah. They determined a joint
mission into deep space.

05:00.599 --> 05:02.832
If successful,
it would end the Cold War

05:02.834 --> 05:05.601
and significantly boost
the economies of both countries.

05:05.603 --> 05:08.505
And success meaning?

05:08.507 --> 05:12.108
Contact with alien lifeforms.

05:12.110 --> 05:15.248
So I'm gonna presume
that this mission failed.

05:16.914 --> 05:21.351
Naturally. We lost contact with
the Elbe August 12th, 2007.

05:21.353 --> 05:25.188
And contact with the ship
was never reestablished?

05:25.190 --> 05:26.757
Not until today.

05:26.759 --> 05:28.892
Get down there and
retrieve our property, Murphy.

05:28.894 --> 05:30.626
There's not a moment to lose.

05:30.628 --> 05:33.162
Co-property, sir.

05:33.164 --> 05:36.099
Surely, the Russians will have
something to say about this.

05:36.101 --> 05:38.135
Well, that's why time
is of the essence.

05:38.137 --> 05:39.969
I want you to use whatever
force is necessary

05:39.971 --> 05:43.306
and report immediately on
the state of the occupant, okay?

05:43.308 --> 05:45.207
Occupant?

05:45.209 --> 05:47.676
A chimpanzee,
certainly deceased,

05:47.678 --> 05:51.147
although we should
proceed with caution.

05:51.149 --> 05:54.019
Everything's a day late
and a dollar short.

06:14.272 --> 06:17.173
Damn! I love the
rumble of a Humvee!

06:17.175 --> 06:19.308
Dr. Reynolds?

06:19.310 --> 06:22.746
Approaching the crash site,
Linda. You ready?

06:22.748 --> 06:24.481
Since when do you do field work?

06:24.483 --> 06:26.049
It's a hell of a lot better

06:26.051 --> 06:29.419
than being stuck behind
a desk in the office.

06:29.421 --> 06:34.190
Listen, kiddo, we've
known each other a long time.

06:34.192 --> 06:36.460
I remember when
your daddy first brought you

06:36.462 --> 06:38.027
to the Kennedy Space Center.

06:38.029 --> 06:41.798
You crawled over that console,
started pushing buttons

06:41.800 --> 06:43.599
and damn near started
World War III.

06:43.601 --> 06:46.335
I was... curious.

06:46.337 --> 06:47.672
You were impulsive!

06:48.974 --> 06:50.907
Now when we get there,

06:50.909 --> 06:53.510
you let us secure that perimeter
before you go charging in.

06:53.512 --> 06:55.445
- You got me?
- Yes, sir!

06:55.447 --> 06:56.445
15 seconds!

06:56.447 --> 06:58.049
Copy that.

07:04.423 --> 07:05.625
Showtime.

07:16.467 --> 07:18.000
Roll up!

07:18.002 --> 07:19.902
You'll be able to see
everything on your laptop.

07:19.904 --> 07:21.572
Just don't post it
on stinkin' YouTube.

07:21.574 --> 07:22.940
Can I livestream?

07:22.942 --> 07:25.442
Hell, no.
This ain't a how-to video.

07:25.444 --> 07:27.310
Copy that.

07:27.312 --> 07:29.279
Do we really need
this much firepower?

07:29.281 --> 07:32.481
When Russia's involved,
better safe than sorry.

07:32.483 --> 07:33.652
Move out!

07:36.187 --> 07:38.691
I'll be on the radio.
Just keep your ears open.

08:14.760 --> 08:16.361
You catching this, Linda?

08:20.764 --> 08:22.101
I see it.

08:38.483 --> 08:40.485
You thinking reentry damage?

08:42.220 --> 08:44.287
Our data shows
both chutes deployed.

08:44.289 --> 08:47.591
Landing on sand wouldn't have
caused that kind of damage.

08:47.593 --> 08:48.828
Get me closer.

09:11.549 --> 09:14.320
Let's get a little closer.
Let's get inside.

09:33.405 --> 09:36.976
The ship wasn't banged in.
It was banged out.

09:42.814 --> 09:44.183
Signs of a struggle.

09:46.117 --> 09:47.887
Where's the pilot?

09:55.893 --> 09:56.961
Don't touch it!

09:58.930 --> 10:02.765
It could be toxic,
possibly contagious!

10:02.767 --> 10:05.735
Dr. Reynolds, I suggest you pull
back until we can determine...

10:05.737 --> 10:06.736
Hold on a second, Linda!

10:10.876 --> 10:12.775
Did you hear that?

10:12.777 --> 10:16.412
Reynolds, pull your
team back, now!

10:16.414 --> 10:17.713
Copy that!

10:17.715 --> 10:19.283
We'll hazmat up and come back.

10:19.285 --> 10:20.750
Roger that.

10:20.752 --> 10:22.320
Back to the Humvees!

10:37.169 --> 10:39.936
What the hell was that?

10:39.938 --> 10:41.073
Sounded like a lion.

10:42.840 --> 10:44.576
Cut the damn chatter!

10:57.555 --> 10:59.190
I've lost visual.

11:02.526 --> 11:03.893
Holy hell!

11:03.895 --> 11:05.127
What the hell?

11:05.129 --> 11:07.230
Open fire!
Open fire!

11:10.701 --> 11:11.900
<i>Retreat! Retreat!</i>

11:11.902 --> 11:13.236
No!

11:21.579 --> 11:24.249
I'm on my way!

11:50.541 --> 11:51.911
Long time, Murphy.

11:52.944 --> 11:54.611
Eva?

11:54.613 --> 11:55.779
Eva Kuleshov?

11:55.781 --> 11:57.279
I was hoping you'd remember.

11:57.281 --> 11:59.218
How could I forget?

12:00.584 --> 12:03.019
Well, there was a lot
of vodka flowing at Oxford.

12:03.021 --> 12:04.953
Let's tend to that head, huh?
Can I get first aid here?

12:04.955 --> 12:06.188
I'm fine.

12:06.190 --> 12:07.457
Where's Under Secretary
Reynolds?

12:07.459 --> 12:09.292
- Who?
- Under Secretary Reynolds!

12:09.294 --> 12:11.030
- I thought he might still...
- Linda!

12:13.732 --> 12:14.666
I'm sorry.

12:15.901 --> 12:17.368
Your comrades fought bravely.

12:19.170 --> 12:21.704
How one fights
is just as important

12:21.706 --> 12:23.206
as the result that it yields.

12:23.208 --> 12:24.973
We're done. Thank you.

12:24.975 --> 12:26.876
Still quoting Lenin?

12:26.878 --> 12:28.343
"Star Trek".

12:28.345 --> 12:29.946
I read you
became a paleontologist

12:29.948 --> 12:31.481
working for the State?

12:31.483 --> 12:33.584
And an astrophysicist
like yourself.

12:37.855 --> 12:40.558
It's good to see you, Murphy,
even under the circumstances.

12:42.294 --> 12:44.160
What attacked us?

12:44.162 --> 12:47.996
It was something quite
extraordinary.

12:47.998 --> 12:49.600
Think you might recognize it.

12:55.741 --> 12:57.741
That's not Abraham.

12:57.743 --> 12:59.141
The creature we saw out there

12:59.143 --> 13:01.444
was 15 feet tall,
over five times...

13:01.446 --> 13:04.813
Six times his original size.

13:04.815 --> 13:07.015
But how?

13:07.017 --> 13:09.318
If this was the Cold War,
I'd have to say, "I'm sorry.

13:09.320 --> 13:12.188
That was hallucination brought
on by your head injury."

13:12.190 --> 13:13.993
I know what I saw.

13:15.594 --> 13:18.160
Luckily, our superiors
are eager to continue

13:18.162 --> 13:20.198
our secret Russo-American union.

13:21.398 --> 13:23.500
The capsule was covered in it.

13:23.502 --> 13:26.669
It is definitely not
of terrestrial origin.

13:26.671 --> 13:29.072
Fantastic!

13:29.074 --> 13:30.673
And the fact that it seems
to have survived

13:30.675 --> 13:32.576
not only exposure to space,
but the intense heat

13:32.578 --> 13:34.776
of reentry makes it
quite the interesting

13:34.778 --> 13:36.978
alien substance indeed.

13:36.980 --> 13:39.117
Do you believe it has something
to do with Abraham's growth?

13:41.786 --> 13:42.952
Inconclusive.

13:42.954 --> 13:44.353
We need to conduct
further testing

13:44.355 --> 13:45.724
in a proper laboratory setting.

13:47.559 --> 13:49.726
Where? Moscow?

13:49.728 --> 13:52.227
No. It appears
we'll be returning

13:52.229 --> 13:54.530
to the scene of the crime.

13:54.532 --> 13:56.701
We're taking Abraham
back to Langley.

14:31.036 --> 14:32.704
Black, as I recall?

14:35.873 --> 14:37.540
Black.

14:37.542 --> 14:39.445
Like the heart of
the space program.

14:41.079 --> 14:42.745
<i>Spasiba.</i>

14:42.747 --> 14:44.183
<i>Pozhaluysta.</i>

14:45.382 --> 14:48.184
Surely, the exploration
of deep space

14:48.186 --> 14:51.987
in order to make contact with
alien life form is a noble...

14:51.989 --> 14:53.459
Noble?

14:56.627 --> 14:59.261
Well-trained, aren't they?

14:59.263 --> 15:01.432
We Russians know how
to control our emotions.

15:02.600 --> 15:03.967
Like at Oxford?

15:03.969 --> 15:05.337
<i>Touché.</i>

15:08.473 --> 15:11.810
Is it my imagination or
is he already getting bigger?

15:16.580 --> 15:19.281
Our latest readings indicate
he is 1.5 meters greater

15:19.283 --> 15:21.285
in length then
when first captured.

15:23.787 --> 15:27.923
It's terrible,
what he's been subjected to.

15:27.925 --> 15:29.360
This never should have happened.

15:35.233 --> 15:38.500
But at least he's home now.

15:38.502 --> 15:40.372
I'm sure you'll take
good care of him.

15:42.806 --> 15:43.774
I'll do my best.

15:57.321 --> 15:58.722
Doctor! Come quick!

15:58.724 --> 16:01.325
He's broken the restraints!

16:02.393 --> 16:03.525
What's happened?

16:03.527 --> 16:05.327
He's broken loose!

16:05.329 --> 16:06.362
Use the gas.
Do it now!

16:06.364 --> 16:08.396
I can't!
He broke it!

16:08.398 --> 16:10.332
- Smart monkey.
- Damn it, get out of here!

16:15.006 --> 16:17.505
Go, go, go!
Secure the area!

16:17.507 --> 16:19.909
Doctor, we have orders
to shoot the beast

16:19.911 --> 16:20.909
if he tries to exit the lab!

16:20.911 --> 16:22.345
Wait! No!

16:22.347 --> 16:25.448
That glass is transparent
armor three feet thick!

16:25.450 --> 16:27.082
You can fire
a howitzer directly at it,

16:27.084 --> 16:28.217
it wouldn't make a difference!

16:28.219 --> 16:29.251
We have armor-piercing shells.

16:29.253 --> 16:30.352
- Prepare to fire!
- No!

16:30.354 --> 16:32.621
- Take aim!
- No, don't!

16:32.623 --> 16:34.055
- Please!
- Get out of the way!

16:34.057 --> 16:35.560
Linda!
Put in the code!

16:39.897 --> 16:40.896
I got it!

16:40.898 --> 16:41.996
I have a shot!

16:41.998 --> 16:42.999
Wait! Hold your fire!

16:43.001 --> 16:44.435
It's working!

16:47.738 --> 16:49.972
The gas is working!
He is sedated!

16:49.974 --> 16:53.409
It is under control!
This isn't necessary!

16:53.411 --> 16:55.446
Eva, put your gun down!
Put your guns down!

17:02.987 --> 17:05.255
Was she out of line? Yes.

17:05.257 --> 17:07.023
But General, you have
to understand,

17:07.025 --> 17:08.323
she grew up with that ape.

17:08.325 --> 17:10.226
I don't care!
Besides, my troops were

17:10.228 --> 17:12.128
held up at gun point
by that commie!

17:12.130 --> 17:14.130
And Dr. Murphy was
on her side?

17:14.132 --> 17:15.797
Dr. Murphy is on our side.

17:15.799 --> 17:17.534
And Eva is a scientist,
not a soldier.

17:17.536 --> 17:21.537
Those two seem unusually chummy.

17:21.539 --> 17:23.005
They're old friends, General,

17:23.007 --> 17:26.208
and they've been at
this since time began.

17:26.210 --> 17:28.009
But can they be trusted?

17:28.011 --> 17:32.614
After all, one is a bleeding
heart animal rights activist

17:32.616 --> 17:36.284
and the other's
a coldblooded Russkie!

17:36.286 --> 17:37.754
I trust Linda.

17:37.756 --> 17:39.988
Let's just hope
she doesn't let her emotions

17:39.990 --> 17:41.459
cloud her judgment.

17:42.938 --> 17:46.149
These are most disturbing developments,
Comrade Kuleshov.

17:46.733 --> 17:48.735
Yes, First Secretary.

17:49.111 --> 17:51.071
And the alien substance?

17:51.154 --> 17:53.949
I assume you have more data
on its connection

17:54.032 --> 17:55.993
to the simian's continued growth?

17:57.286 --> 18:00.497
More testing is needed, First Secretary.

18:01.164 --> 18:05.961
Well, Comrade Kuleshov,
you are now in the land of the heathen.

18:06.128 --> 18:07.754
Radicalism runs rampant.

18:09.173 --> 18:11.508
Yes, First Secretary.

18:12.551 --> 18:14.553
For your sake...

18:14.636 --> 18:17.472
I strongly suggest that
you engage in some.

18:17.681 --> 18:18.682
Immediately.

19:19.123 --> 19:22.057
<i>Vector seven bravo two.</i>

19:22.059 --> 19:23.825
Vector seven bravo two.

19:23.827 --> 19:26.195
<i>You ready to give us a report
there, McDaniels?</i>

19:26.197 --> 19:28.563
Yeah, my bladder's full,
but it's calm.

19:28.565 --> 19:31.699
<i>Oh, yeah? Sounds like you're
having a busy night there.</i>

19:31.701 --> 19:33.334
Yeah, it's pretty chilly,
it's pretty nice.

19:33.336 --> 19:37.540
All by myself and quiet.
I'm gonna check this thing out.

19:37.542 --> 19:39.976
<i>You sure that's a good idea?</i>

19:39.978 --> 19:43.111
How the hell did a monkey
survive in this?

19:43.113 --> 19:45.750
<i>I don't know, McDaniels,
why don't you tell us?</i>

19:50.255 --> 19:53.622
<i>Sounds like you're ready
to camp out in that capsule.</i>

19:53.624 --> 19:55.658
I don't think there's enough
room for me to take a shit.

19:55.660 --> 19:57.896
<i>Well, don't get
too comfortable.</i>

20:00.565 --> 20:02.133
Man, this is crazy!

20:28.860 --> 20:30.993
Oh, shit!

20:30.995 --> 20:33.027
There's something...

20:33.029 --> 20:35.566
There's something huge
outside the capsule.

21:03.594 --> 21:05.160
<i>McDaniels,
you okay over there?</i>

21:05.162 --> 21:06.864
<i>You sound like
you pissed yourself.</i>

21:08.399 --> 21:09.801
Yeah, I'm fine.

21:13.737 --> 21:15.774
<i>You sure about that?</i>

21:16.807 --> 21:18.175
Yeah, I think so.

21:32.757 --> 21:34.457
What was that, Eagle Eye?

21:34.459 --> 21:36.525
Come again!

21:36.527 --> 21:37.828
Crap.

21:39.730 --> 21:41.330
What happened?

21:41.332 --> 21:43.999
Eagle Eye reports something
strange from the crash site.

21:44.001 --> 21:45.633
Then the line just went dead.

21:45.635 --> 21:47.169
Try him again.

21:47.171 --> 21:48.403
Surveillance cameras?

21:48.405 --> 21:49.707
- Of course.
- Oh, yeah.

21:51.276 --> 21:53.007
All right, look. It's been
this way the last few minutes.

21:53.009 --> 21:56.178
We got the report just...
right before this came in.

21:56.180 --> 21:57.380
Okay.

21:57.382 --> 21:58.549
Play it back!

22:00.017 --> 22:02.450
There!

22:02.452 --> 22:04.486
They saw something
out to the west!

22:04.488 --> 22:05.921
Yes!

22:05.923 --> 22:07.957
Something that knocked out
the video feed.

22:07.959 --> 22:11.759
- But what?
- EMP?

22:11.761 --> 22:12.894
Right.
The live feed came back on!

22:12.896 --> 22:15.733
I got five, four, three...

22:23.207 --> 22:24.543
Stop! What is that?

22:26.043 --> 22:27.043
Oh, shit.

22:27.045 --> 22:28.643
Whoa.

22:28.645 --> 22:31.081
Does that look
like a tail to you?

22:33.183 --> 22:37.352
Possibly, or just a glitch
caused by interference.

22:37.354 --> 22:38.553
No, no, no.

22:38.555 --> 22:40.656
A glitch?
That's organic!

22:40.658 --> 22:42.391
A tail?
Reptilian.

22:42.393 --> 22:44.192
I don't know what kind of
reptiles you're playing with.

22:44.194 --> 22:46.864
I've never seen a reptile
with a tail that size!

22:53.438 --> 22:58.640
Get me a high-resolution copy,
stills and slo-mo.

22:58.642 --> 23:01.043
All right.
I got you, boss.

23:01.045 --> 23:02.878
Let's not jump to conclusions!

23:02.880 --> 23:05.214
I'm not jumping.
I'm hypothesizing.

23:05.216 --> 23:07.349
That there's another
mutation out there?

23:07.351 --> 23:10.553
The MP radioed that there
was something giant.

23:10.555 --> 23:12.955
How do we know that there
weren't traces of that substance

23:12.957 --> 23:14.657
left on the desert floor?

23:14.659 --> 23:16.291
It's possible.

23:16.293 --> 23:17.329
We gotta make certain.

23:18.395 --> 23:21.095
Something killed those men,

23:21.097 --> 23:23.666
something with enough energy
to black out all communications

23:23.668 --> 23:26.302
until it was well out of range.

23:26.304 --> 23:27.768
I'm going out there.

23:27.770 --> 23:30.540
Stop! I'll go.
It was my team.

23:30.542 --> 23:32.440
It was my responsibility.
Stay.

23:32.442 --> 23:36.478
My whole life has been
in pursuit of first contact.

23:36.480 --> 23:39.782
I'd hoped it would
manifest otherwise.

23:39.784 --> 23:42.051
But if it is in the form
of a virulent strain,

23:42.053 --> 23:43.284
it must be fully contained.

23:43.286 --> 23:45.019
What about Abraham?

23:45.021 --> 23:46.621
If he tries another breakout?

23:46.623 --> 23:50.159
Our latest measurements show
that his growth has slowed.

23:50.161 --> 23:51.994
Plus, he's in a bunker
that can withstand

23:51.996 --> 23:53.929
a direct hit from
a hydrogen bomb.

23:53.931 --> 23:56.867
Still, we should
boost his sedation.

24:00.136 --> 24:03.973
Agreed.

24:13.351 --> 24:15.118
The wind sweeps
this desert hourly.

24:15.120 --> 24:17.719
I don't know
why we're bothering.

24:17.721 --> 24:18.754
Keep on it.

24:18.756 --> 24:20.188
I got a feeling.

24:20.190 --> 24:21.622
You know, feelings
put people out of business.

24:21.624 --> 24:23.027
That's how
I lost my ex.

24:24.061 --> 24:26.094
Zip it and keep scanning.

24:26.096 --> 24:28.464
At least I know how to
wear a harness, honey.

24:28.466 --> 24:29.934
I like it this way.

24:31.535 --> 24:32.836
Over here.

24:34.005 --> 24:35.204
Oh, God!

24:35.206 --> 24:38.107
This isn't from the crash.

24:38.109 --> 24:40.311
Look at the bones.
They're shorn off.

24:41.578 --> 24:42.844
Oh, God.

24:42.846 --> 24:44.815
Something else
happened to this man.

24:49.620 --> 24:51.786
<i>Murphy? Status update.</i>

24:51.788 --> 24:53.656
Yes, sir.
We're on-site now.

24:53.658 --> 24:55.090
<i>And?</i>

24:55.092 --> 24:57.525
Small traces of substance
have been recovered.

24:57.527 --> 24:59.328
Damn it!
I expected as much.

24:59.330 --> 25:01.063
This is exactly why
I wanted you

25:01.065 --> 25:02.797
to investigate alone
without them.

25:02.799 --> 25:04.132
<i>They bungled it!</i>

25:04.134 --> 25:05.868
Couldn't even properly
contain the most

25:05.870 --> 25:07.402
significant find
of the 20th century.

25:07.404 --> 25:09.537
By them, do you man
our Russian partners?

25:09.539 --> 25:11.006
<i>Partners?
They were never partners,</i>

25:11.008 --> 25:12.707
not even during World War II

25:12.709 --> 25:14.476
when they were
supposedly allies.

25:14.478 --> 25:15.843
They were never partners!

25:15.845 --> 25:17.313
They took Berlin, sir.

25:17.315 --> 25:18.781
<i>A publicity stunt!</i>

25:18.783 --> 25:20.582
A billion killed,
they were allowed

25:20.584 --> 25:22.083
to piss on Hitler's grave first.

25:22.085 --> 25:25.286
But Patton had it right.
They were never to be trusted.

25:25.288 --> 25:29.123
But this space program
was Bush and Putin's dream,

25:29.125 --> 25:30.759
<i>making first contact together.</i>

25:30.761 --> 25:33.795
Murphy, when is that innocent
bubble of yours gonna burst?

25:33.797 --> 25:35.864
This program was
a disaster from the start

25:35.866 --> 25:37.365
and it's only getting worse.

25:37.367 --> 25:38.668
Sir?

25:38.670 --> 25:40.569
We just had a report of
unidentified light patterns

25:40.571 --> 25:42.170
moving really fast eastbound.

25:42.172 --> 25:43.304
<i>Sir?</i>

25:43.306 --> 25:44.974
I'm gonna send you
some coordinates.

25:44.976 --> 25:47.141
<i>Can you pass by
as you head back to Langley?</i>

25:47.143 --> 25:49.247
- <i>Of course.</i>
- Good deal.

25:54.552 --> 25:55.751
Detour.

25:55.753 --> 25:57.922
Great. Awesome.

26:08.032 --> 26:09.497
What is it now,
Comrade Eisenstein?

26:09.499 --> 26:11.166
Am I ever allowed to get
more than a moment of rest?

26:11.168 --> 26:12.767
But it's dying, Comrade Doctor.

26:12.769 --> 26:14.636
- What is?
- The alien matter.

26:14.638 --> 26:17.238
You see?

26:17.240 --> 26:18.473
Why?

26:18.475 --> 26:21.176
It appears that any exposure
in our environment

26:21.178 --> 26:23.778
eventually causes
irreversible cellular breakdown.

26:23.780 --> 26:27.149
Every sample we've acquired is
diminishing along these lines.

26:27.151 --> 26:28.749
What is the timeline?

26:28.751 --> 26:32.655
I estimate total cellular
breakdown within three hours.

26:32.657 --> 26:34.390
Is that a conservative estimate?

26:34.392 --> 26:35.791
It is.

26:38.997 --> 26:40.196
And in Abraham?

26:40.198 --> 26:41.563
What?

26:41.565 --> 26:44.032
The substance is in
the simian's bloodstream, idiot!

26:44.034 --> 26:45.804
Is he still active?

26:50.207 --> 26:51.506
The last blood test taken

26:51.508 --> 26:53.942
was just after
his attempted breakout.

26:53.944 --> 26:55.776
We didn't dare pull
another sample

26:55.778 --> 26:57.513
after Dr. Murphy
calmed him down.

26:57.515 --> 26:59.380
But, fortunately,
he injured his hand

26:59.382 --> 27:02.251
and left a nice sample
smeared on the chamber floor.

27:02.253 --> 27:03.651
Result?

27:03.653 --> 27:06.588
Diminishment, Comrade Doctor.
Reduced cellular activity.

27:06.590 --> 27:09.957
Perhaps this accounts for
his lower rate of growth.

27:09.959 --> 27:11.226
But no petrification?

27:11.228 --> 27:12.628
No.

27:12.630 --> 27:14.129
That means the alien substance

27:14.131 --> 27:16.130
can still survive
within Abraham.

27:16.132 --> 27:18.266
Perhaps an organic host
preserves substance

27:18.268 --> 27:20.067
better than
any inorganic system.

27:20.069 --> 27:21.602
But they're still dying.

27:21.604 --> 27:22.638
Can they be replenished?

27:22.640 --> 27:25.142
Comrade Doctor?

27:28.145 --> 27:30.345
The simian's life was
over effectively the moment

27:30.347 --> 27:32.915
he was entered in the program
thirty years ago.

27:32.917 --> 27:34.586
His life is expendable.

27:36.687 --> 27:39.521
Meanwhile, our first
contact with an alien life form

27:39.523 --> 27:42.123
is being marginalized to
the point of annihilation.

27:42.125 --> 27:43.793
We cannot allow this to happen.

27:43.795 --> 27:45.660
The substance must be preserved.

27:45.662 --> 27:48.096
Prepare to release
the gas in Bunker 6.

27:48.098 --> 27:49.233
Do it quickly.

27:50.534 --> 27:52.334
I want you to take every
viable sample

27:52.336 --> 27:53.936
and load it into a syringe.

27:53.938 --> 27:56.170
We're going to inject
the alien matter into Abraham.

27:56.172 --> 27:57.739
But, Comrade Doctor,

27:57.741 --> 28:01.142
we don't know how
it will affect the beast.

28:01.144 --> 28:03.512
Are you prepared to allow
for the extermination

28:03.514 --> 28:08.516
of an entire alien species
for the sake of one damned ape?

28:08.518 --> 28:09.884
No, Comrade Doctor.

28:09.886 --> 28:12.522
Well then, you have
your orders.

28:26.703 --> 28:28.269
How we doing?

28:28.271 --> 28:30.772
We're two clicks away from
the coordinates he set.

28:30.774 --> 28:33.111
What are we looking for?

28:34.478 --> 28:35.613
That!

28:36.814 --> 28:38.216
Holy shit!

28:40.651 --> 28:41.950
The train...

28:41.952 --> 28:44.786
It's heading straight
towards it!

28:44.788 --> 28:48.924
This is a COMSEC priority!
Patch me into the DOT, ASAP!

28:48.926 --> 28:50.993
This is nothing to do with us.

28:50.995 --> 28:52.561
This is Dr. Linda Murphy

28:52.563 --> 28:54.963
of the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration!

28:54.965 --> 28:58.467
You have a passenger train
heading straight towards...

28:58.469 --> 29:00.703
Hello? Hello?

29:00.705 --> 29:02.338
Something's interfering!

29:02.340 --> 29:04.339
The radio's dead!
We gotta pull over!

29:04.341 --> 29:07.011
- Damn it!
- Our nav's out too!

29:08.278 --> 29:10.446
Is that engineer blind?

29:10.448 --> 29:12.249
Brake, you son of a bitch!
Brake!

29:25.228 --> 29:28.030
That bridge was
our only way forward.

29:28.032 --> 29:29.200
We're gonna have
to proceed on foot.

29:30.066 --> 29:31.867
You're joking, right?

29:31.869 --> 29:33.004
I didn't prepare for hiking.

29:34.238 --> 29:35.437
Where are you going?

29:35.439 --> 29:37.573
You said we have
to take it on foot.

29:37.575 --> 29:38.742
Let's go!

29:42.533 --> 29:44.326
Yes, First Secretary.

29:44.576 --> 29:48.413
The alien life form is
secure inside its host.

29:48.664 --> 29:50.457
I'll keep you informed.

29:52.055 --> 29:53.054
Yes, Eisenstein?

29:53.056 --> 29:54.656
Excuse me, Doctor.

29:54.658 --> 29:58.759
<i>We've lost contact with
Dr. Murphy and her team.</i>

29:58.761 --> 30:03.000
<i>A few miles before reaching the
target, their signal cut out.</i>

30:03.866 --> 30:05.434
How long?

30:05.436 --> 30:07.071
<i>We heard nothing
for a half hour.</i>

30:16.847 --> 30:17.879
<i>What's the target, doctor?</i>

30:17.881 --> 30:18.980
Unknown.

30:18.982 --> 30:20.482
<i>Well, you'll be ready.</i>

30:20.484 --> 30:22.450
<i>This baby's got
16 Hellfire missiles</i>

30:22.452 --> 30:24.852
<i>with thermobaric warheads,
10 Hydra rockets,</i>

30:24.854 --> 30:26.955
<i>and a 30mm chain gun
to bust the tables.</i>

30:26.957 --> 30:28.756
Yes, but can it shoot?

30:28.758 --> 30:32.093
<i>That's my bird you're piloting.
It'll get the job done.</i>

30:32.095 --> 30:33.128
<i>Sensors got something.</i>

30:33.130 --> 30:34.329
I see it.

30:34.331 --> 30:36.534
<i>Turn .65 degrees.</i>

31:09.467 --> 31:13.001
That's it.
We are totally lost.

31:13.003 --> 31:15.103
Try the radio again.

31:15.105 --> 31:17.805
And I told you, doctor.
It's fried.

31:17.807 --> 31:19.807
Whatever energy that
creature was emitting

31:19.809 --> 31:22.745
burned it along with every
communicator we have.

31:22.747 --> 31:23.978
That's great.

31:23.980 --> 31:25.345
You know, we're just
gonna die out here.

31:25.347 --> 31:26.480
That's marvelous.

31:26.482 --> 31:27.916
Well, that's the spirit, troop.

31:27.918 --> 31:30.919
If at first you don't succeed,
forget about it!

31:30.921 --> 31:31.919
Yeah, that's it.

31:31.921 --> 31:33.255
We gotta keep moving.

31:33.257 --> 31:36.123
Get to civilization and
let the authorities know

31:36.125 --> 31:37.860
what they're dealing with.

31:37.862 --> 31:38.860
Wait, wait, wait.

31:39.863 --> 31:41.830
You were saying?

31:41.832 --> 31:44.099
You hear that?

31:44.101 --> 31:47.334
Baker to Able.
Do you copy?

31:47.336 --> 31:49.304
<i>They're not responding.
Is it them?</i>

31:49.306 --> 31:51.407
Well, I doubt that anyone would
be picnicking out here.

31:51.409 --> 31:54.645
Baker to Able.
Do you copy?

31:55.911 --> 31:58.348
Linda, it's Eva!

32:01.151 --> 32:03.185
Ah, finally!

32:03.187 --> 32:04.519
They're coming in.

32:04.521 --> 32:07.255
See? We're good!
We're safe!

32:07.257 --> 32:09.123
Eyes are peeled.

32:09.125 --> 32:12.092
<i>For what? Ain't nothing out
here but lizards and beach.</i>

32:12.094 --> 32:13.461
You know, maybe
you're right.

32:13.463 --> 32:15.263
I'm thinking about
this all wrong.

32:15.265 --> 32:16.398
It's my fault.

32:16.400 --> 32:19.633
Power of psychological thinking.

32:22.439 --> 32:24.605
Is that an earthquake?

32:24.607 --> 32:25.573
No.

32:25.575 --> 32:27.745
- Run!
- Linda! Linda!

32:35.219 --> 32:37.052
How's that for a target?

32:37.054 --> 32:38.786
<i>Jesus.</i>

32:38.788 --> 32:40.655
Myers, get down!

32:43.893 --> 32:45.328
I'm opening fire!

32:51.669 --> 32:53.470
C'mere.

33:00.010 --> 33:02.180
Who do you think's flying
that helicopter?

33:03.247 --> 33:04.746
Someone with a lot of balls.

33:04.748 --> 33:07.716
I'm coming around
for another pass!

33:07.718 --> 33:09.717
It's time for the chain gun.

33:14.458 --> 33:17.158
<i>That ain't doing squat!
That armor's too thick!</i>

33:17.160 --> 33:18.763
Ah!

33:24.468 --> 33:25.803
It's coming.

33:27.738 --> 33:32.373
Time to show this lizard
you don't mess with a Russian.

33:32.375 --> 33:34.409
I'm firing more rockets!

33:37.648 --> 33:39.781
<i>That thing's too close,
you might hit the team!</i>

33:39.783 --> 33:42.820
They're dead if I don't fire!
I'm firing now!

33:55.833 --> 33:58.600
<i>Knock, knock.
The reptile's gone.</i>

33:58.602 --> 34:00.771
He's underground.

34:03.074 --> 34:04.906
Anyone home?

34:04.908 --> 34:06.073
It's Eva.

34:06.075 --> 34:07.942
A few minutes more
and I was gonna leave.

34:07.944 --> 34:10.511
Was that you flying?

34:10.513 --> 34:13.781
That was some
fancy flying back there.

34:13.783 --> 34:15.449
We lost Myers.

34:15.451 --> 34:17.351
I know. I saw.

34:17.353 --> 34:18.853
That creature...

34:18.855 --> 34:22.223
Gila Monster,
no doubt about it.

34:22.225 --> 34:24.058
The image on the video was...

34:24.060 --> 34:29.163
Its tail, yes,
I can see that now, but how?

34:29.165 --> 34:31.366
The desert is its home.

34:31.368 --> 34:35.603
Only an alien element could have
caused such a massive mutation.

34:35.605 --> 34:38.207
We found remnants
of it at the site, clearly.

34:38.209 --> 34:39.875
Right.

34:39.877 --> 34:41.542
The creature made contact.
It's been growing ever since.

34:41.544 --> 34:43.478
Right. You ready to go
back to work

34:43.480 --> 34:45.549
or is that your
new lab down there?

34:58.594 --> 35:00.228
He's gotten loose!

35:00.230 --> 35:02.196
Brace the door!

35:02.198 --> 35:03.897
He's trying to get out!

35:11.174 --> 35:12.239
Ah!

35:12.241 --> 35:14.312
Close the door!
Close the door!

35:18.314 --> 35:19.616
No!

35:32.930 --> 35:35.062
I've already notified
Washington and the Kremlin.

35:35.064 --> 35:37.397
This lizard won't
remain hidden for long.

35:37.399 --> 35:38.732
But how to destroy it?

35:38.734 --> 35:41.101
The strikes you made
only seemed to slow him.

35:41.103 --> 35:42.304
Yes.

35:42.306 --> 35:43.371
Obviously, much
higher concentration

35:43.373 --> 35:44.940
of firepower will be necessary.

35:44.942 --> 35:46.141
<i>This is Langley
for Dr. Murphy.</i>

35:46.143 --> 35:47.841
It's the lab.

35:47.843 --> 35:51.078
<i>Linda, he's got loose.
We couldn't stop him.</i>

35:51.080 --> 35:53.116
Abraham's escaped.

35:54.384 --> 35:55.717
Abraham's escaped!

35:55.719 --> 35:57.018
What?

35:57.020 --> 35:58.252
There's no way.

36:10.134 --> 36:12.234
I don't understand.

36:12.236 --> 36:15.236
His growth rate had slowed.

36:15.238 --> 36:18.475
How could he grow three times
his size so quickly?

36:24.915 --> 36:28.119
I want to see
the surveillance video.

36:29.919 --> 36:31.087
Freeze it.

36:32.955 --> 36:36.458
What about the cameras in
the bunker before the breakout?

36:36.460 --> 36:38.460
Maybe it has some clue.

36:38.462 --> 36:41.596
Unfortunately, the simian
disabled the surveillance camera

36:41.598 --> 36:43.834
shortly before we received
your distress call.

36:44.902 --> 36:48.536
He's changed, but how?

36:48.538 --> 36:49.774
What caused it?

36:51.440 --> 36:52.774
Abraham's tracker!

36:52.776 --> 36:54.710
Where is he heading now?

36:54.712 --> 36:56.777
Moving fast. Looks like
he's heading north towards...

36:56.779 --> 36:58.679
Seaford? I don't know.

36:58.681 --> 37:01.216
Any reports
of further destruction?

37:01.218 --> 37:03.752
No, unfortunately, he's
in the Blue Ridge Mountains,

37:03.754 --> 37:06.654
but it's a ideal hiding
place for an ape.

37:06.656 --> 37:08.989
A creature that size
doesn't just disappear.

37:08.991 --> 37:11.528
People will think that
it's your American Bigfoot.

37:12.529 --> 37:14.362
It's just a matter of time.

37:14.364 --> 37:15.830
There are rumors
he has destroyed

37:15.832 --> 37:18.400
your new Extraterrestrial
Defense Initiative.

37:18.402 --> 37:20.100
But nobody here will confirm it.

37:20.102 --> 37:23.105
How do you know about EDI?
That's classified.

37:23.107 --> 37:25.138
Your new Star Wars program?
Please.

37:25.140 --> 37:27.841
Haven't you learned
this yet about us Russians?

37:27.843 --> 37:30.045
We know things about
you people before you do.

37:31.147 --> 37:33.549
The signal's gone dead.

37:33.551 --> 37:35.016
What was his last location?

37:35.018 --> 37:39.457
I don't know,
looks like Beaverton.

37:40.422 --> 37:41.422
Huh.

37:41.424 --> 37:43.958
You know it?

37:43.960 --> 37:45.826
Yeah, I know it.

37:45.828 --> 37:48.598
Went fishing there
when I was growing up.

37:50.834 --> 37:52.236
We need to get to Washington.

37:53.569 --> 37:55.036
I think I should...

37:55.038 --> 37:56.670
Yes, Jones?

37:56.672 --> 37:58.609
Jones, get your coat.

38:01.011 --> 38:03.247
Fine, fine.
I'm coming, I'm coming.

38:04.181 --> 38:05.483
Coming!

38:58.535 --> 39:00.033
We just got word!

39:00.035 --> 39:02.971
Abraham was spotted three miles
east of Rollins Fork!

39:02.973 --> 39:04.438
We know, but that
was two hours ago.

39:04.440 --> 39:05.540
No eyes yet.

39:05.542 --> 39:07.475
Abraham ripped out his GPS.

39:07.477 --> 39:08.609
Smart monkey!

39:08.611 --> 39:10.312
How can you lose giant ape?

39:10.314 --> 39:13.614
He hasn't hit any
major population centers

39:13.616 --> 39:14.815
and appears to be hiding.

39:14.817 --> 39:17.051
Nonsense!
It's a monkey!

39:17.053 --> 39:19.420
With the ability to comprehend
complex thoughts.

39:19.422 --> 39:21.888
What about that lizard?

39:21.890 --> 39:23.424
Underground. No chip.

39:23.426 --> 39:25.725
You have big problem in America.

39:25.727 --> 39:28.263
Lizards can swim,
First Secretary.

39:28.265 --> 39:30.699
Russia can soon have
the same problem.

39:30.701 --> 39:32.533
Abraham must be getting bigger.

39:32.535 --> 39:33.737
How?

39:35.138 --> 39:37.406
The man behind Project Elbe
is your father, right?

39:37.408 --> 39:39.241
He has nothing to do with this.

39:39.243 --> 39:41.408
Well, he may be able to give
us some answers we need.

39:41.410 --> 39:42.944
Like what?

39:42.946 --> 39:46.882
Like why Abraham is still
alive after all this time?

39:46.884 --> 39:50.518
Why is he behaving
so strategically?

39:50.520 --> 39:52.819
In case you don't
remember, he was dismissed

39:52.821 --> 39:54.455
from the program
because of Elbe.

39:54.457 --> 39:57.324
I suggest you look
at the present for answers,

39:57.326 --> 39:58.893
not the past.

39:58.895 --> 40:02.163
I believe your emotions
are, uh...

40:02.165 --> 40:05.067
adversely coloring your
conclusions, Dr. Murphy.

40:05.069 --> 40:06.900
There's nothing
personal here, sir.

40:06.902 --> 40:09.069
I haven't spoken to my father
in over 10 years.

40:09.071 --> 40:14.442
You reported some kind
of glow for this creature.

40:14.444 --> 40:15.976
Is that correct, Dr. Murphy?

40:15.978 --> 40:16.978
Yes.

40:16.980 --> 40:18.011
But your super chimp...

40:18.013 --> 40:19.281
- Abraham.
- Abraham, yeah.

40:19.283 --> 40:21.382
He didn't show any glow.

40:21.384 --> 40:23.518
No, sir, not since last contact.

40:23.520 --> 40:26.254
Well, what do you think
accounts for this discrepancy?

40:26.256 --> 40:28.156
We believe Abraham's
ingestion of the substance

40:28.158 --> 40:30.091
was a gradual
microparticulate intake...

40:30.093 --> 40:31.592
- Uh-huh.
- Much like a gas.

40:31.594 --> 40:32.627
Okay.

40:32.629 --> 40:34.129
It slowly penetrated the capsule

40:34.131 --> 40:36.364
and mixed with the oxygen
Abraham was breathing.

40:36.366 --> 40:38.399
Whereas the Gila
monster may have ingested

40:38.401 --> 40:39.634
the substance directly.

40:39.636 --> 40:41.768
This is all very
interesting, doctors.

40:41.770 --> 40:43.538
I have only one question.

40:43.540 --> 40:47.308
Where exactly are these
two freaks of nature now?

40:47.310 --> 40:49.409
Let me introduce
General Delaney, doctors,

40:49.411 --> 40:53.413
taking command for
the late General Reynolds.

40:53.415 --> 40:58.252
Dr. Murphy, I understand you and
my predecessor were very close.

40:58.254 --> 41:02.290
You have my sympathies,
but you must appreciate

41:02.292 --> 41:06.393
that this is not a time
for emotional outcries.

41:06.395 --> 41:08.864
I didn't believe
I was engaging in any.

41:08.866 --> 41:10.899
The safety of this great nation

41:10.901 --> 41:14.435
must take precedence
over any scientific debate.

41:14.437 --> 41:16.370
Debate over what?

41:16.372 --> 41:20.607
Both monsters must be
destroyed immediately.

41:20.609 --> 41:22.611
Now wait a minute!
Abraham...

41:22.613 --> 41:24.411
Abraham. You see?

41:24.413 --> 41:29.083
You're talking like that ape
is your pet hamster!

41:29.085 --> 41:32.453
Look, this is
all academic, girls.

41:32.455 --> 41:33.855
Girls?

41:33.857 --> 41:37.391
The orders have been given.
Shoot to kill.

41:37.393 --> 41:38.926
Is this true, sir?

41:38.928 --> 41:40.428
Abraham is part of
the space program!

41:40.430 --> 41:45.031
For all intents and purposes,
he is a test pilot.

41:45.033 --> 41:47.634
You don't have to kill him!

41:47.636 --> 41:49.937
We can figure out what's wrong,
fix this disease.

41:49.939 --> 41:51.272
General Delaney's right.

41:51.274 --> 41:52.940
We can't afford
any more casualties.

41:52.942 --> 41:56.109
And certainly not
a nationwide panic!

41:56.111 --> 41:59.281
Your job now is
to track these beasts.

41:59.283 --> 42:02.549
Locate them and
let the military do the rest!

42:02.551 --> 42:04.853
Is that clear?

42:04.855 --> 42:06.090
Clear, sir.

42:13.830 --> 42:15.931
You were saying, General?

42:15.933 --> 42:19.232
I was saying I have
six armored divisions

42:19.234 --> 42:21.236
massing on the
West Virginia border.

42:21.238 --> 42:26.509
As soon as that salamander
shows his skin, he's guacamole!

42:28.277 --> 42:34.449
I was here, you know,
when I was a child.

42:34.451 --> 42:36.884
I didn't.

42:36.886 --> 42:41.388
I remember you
speaking of your father,

42:41.390 --> 42:42.723
the great Noel Murphy.

42:42.725 --> 42:45.027
Hah. Great.

42:46.363 --> 42:50.031
He is, after all, the father
of modern astrophysics.

42:50.033 --> 42:52.435
He should have been
father to his children.

42:54.337 --> 42:59.008
Genius takes precedence.
at times, even over life.

43:00.310 --> 43:01.475
Star Trek?

43:01.477 --> 43:03.212
Lenin.

43:05.147 --> 43:07.515
You clearly admired the man.

43:07.517 --> 43:09.553
You keep his photograph.

43:10.853 --> 43:12.920
You followed in his footsteps.

43:12.922 --> 43:16.556
I wanted his approval,

43:16.558 --> 43:20.194
but even then, I knew
his methods were unethical.

43:20.196 --> 43:23.263
And that the ends
didn't justify the means.

43:23.265 --> 43:26.435
And all the animals forced
into the space program.

43:27.136 --> 43:30.437
Laika, Miss Baker

43:30.439 --> 43:33.808
and all of the rabbits,
dogs, mice...

43:33.810 --> 43:36.643
and chimps all forcibly
shot into space

43:36.645 --> 43:39.480
for the benefit of mankind
were a terrible mistake

43:39.482 --> 43:41.216
borne out of ambition

43:41.218 --> 43:44.821
and ignorance... and that
it would never happen again.

43:46.589 --> 43:49.390
My father lied to me,

43:49.392 --> 43:51.692
the great man,

43:51.694 --> 43:54.895
said that this time
it would be different.

43:54.897 --> 43:57.401
That Abraham would be safe.

43:58.368 --> 44:00.366
And how he would return a hero

44:00.368 --> 44:03.504
and become
the most important ape...

44:03.506 --> 44:07.444
important animal...
who ever lived.

44:08.578 --> 44:10.344
But he has returned

44:10.346 --> 44:13.446
and your father's prophecy
may very well come to pass.

44:13.448 --> 44:19.788
Abraham was lost
in space for 30 years!

44:19.790 --> 44:23.757
Can you imagine the toll
that has taken on his mind,

44:23.759 --> 44:26.995
if he has any mind at all?

44:26.997 --> 44:30.531
To speak nothing
of this mutation which,

44:30.533 --> 44:34.304
in all probability,
will most likely kill him.

44:36.906 --> 44:40.377
My father promised me...

44:41.844 --> 44:45.179
no more animals would suffer

44:45.181 --> 44:47.050
and I believed him!

44:48.651 --> 44:53.656
So much so that I made Abraham
that very same promise!

44:58.728 --> 45:01.098
It wasn't your fault, Milaya.

45:04.968 --> 45:07.835
As children, we were taught

45:07.837 --> 45:12.040
the individual is not important.

45:12.042 --> 45:15.178
But what matters most
is service to the state.

45:17.747 --> 45:21.984
So if one man matters not,
what chance had an animal?

45:26.189 --> 45:28.325
I've learned a lot since then.

45:39.835 --> 45:42.835
I'll be damned if all I do is
put a target on Abraham's back.

45:42.837 --> 45:45.940
We must find him first and try
to arrest his growth.

45:45.942 --> 45:47.875
Here.

45:47.877 --> 45:49.743
We will, Milaya.

45:49.745 --> 45:51.411
Okay.

45:51.413 --> 45:53.547
I've enhanced
our Apache's thermal tracking

45:53.549 --> 45:56.618
software with an algorithm
that can recognize

45:56.620 --> 46:00.087
the alien cells that are active
within Abraham's biology.

46:00.089 --> 46:02.259
But once located,
will he come quietly?

46:04.326 --> 46:06.460
You're going to need
a bigger teddy bear.

46:06.462 --> 46:08.529
I have the lab working up
a hyper tranquilizer.

46:08.531 --> 46:10.964
The one we currently have
wouldn't put his leg to sleep.

46:10.966 --> 46:12.866
I've got a plan
for a net

46:12.868 --> 46:15.736
that can be jettisoned from
the belly of the Apache.

46:15.738 --> 46:17.337
It requires explosives

46:17.339 --> 46:21.875
and acts like an inverse reentry
parachute deployment system.

46:21.877 --> 46:24.379
No rest for the weary, huh?
Just like Oxford.

46:24.381 --> 46:27.614
I got a friend at JPL
working on the prototype.

46:27.616 --> 46:30.083
But it's not gonna be
ready in over 24 hours.

46:30.085 --> 46:31.719
What are you thinking, Milaya?

46:31.721 --> 46:34.654
We're doing everything we can,
and on no sleep at that.

46:34.656 --> 46:37.759
Are we?

46:37.761 --> 46:39.694
We must be missing something.

46:39.696 --> 46:40.862
What?

46:40.864 --> 46:42.462
I don't know.

46:42.464 --> 46:45.466
I mean, we've been so
focused on the creatures.

46:45.468 --> 46:47.433
Maybe we should worry
about this green goo.

46:47.435 --> 46:50.004
Let the military
worry about that.

46:53.810 --> 46:55.844
Hello?

46:55.846 --> 46:57.712
When?

46:57.714 --> 46:59.612
Check the news.

46:59.614 --> 47:01.248
<i>All communications are down</i>

47:01.250 --> 47:02.917
<i>for ten miles
surrounding Huntington</i>

47:02.919 --> 47:05.719
<i>due to an unidentified
electrical disturbance.</i>

47:05.721 --> 47:08.455
That's gotta be
that damn lizard.

47:08.457 --> 47:10.257
Delaney will be diverting
all of his efforts

47:10.259 --> 47:12.592
towards taking down
that Gila monster.

47:12.594 --> 47:14.728
We might have a chance
to save Abraham.

47:14.730 --> 47:16.165
Let's go.

47:31.413 --> 47:35.815
I've got something...
faint, but it's there.

47:35.817 --> 47:38.585
Bearing?

47:38.587 --> 47:39.853
Eight-two-zero.

47:39.855 --> 47:41.355
Copy.

47:41.357 --> 47:43.324
There's no safe place
to pull over.

47:43.326 --> 47:45.159
Find a clearing!
Anywhere!

47:45.161 --> 47:47.295
Copy.

47:47.297 --> 47:49.766
Up ahead, right over there.

48:00.843 --> 48:02.845
He's up ahead, 50 meters.

48:05.781 --> 48:08.583
Strange.

48:08.585 --> 48:10.420
Blood.

48:12.754 --> 48:14.087
No.

48:14.089 --> 48:15.591
Unknown.

48:18.727 --> 48:20.194
Hang on.

48:20.196 --> 48:22.062
The cell count is diminishing.

48:22.064 --> 48:24.799
It's the air, yes.

48:24.801 --> 48:27.370
It kills the alien cells.

48:30.040 --> 48:32.140
We made some
preliminary findings

48:32.142 --> 48:34.310
while you were patrolling
the crash site.

48:37.647 --> 48:39.547
Findings?

48:39.549 --> 48:41.348
And then all hell broke loose.

48:41.350 --> 48:42.982
What findings?

48:42.984 --> 48:45.685
As I said, whatever
extraterrestrial component

48:45.687 --> 48:49.190
is inherent in that material
is not viable in our atmosphere.

48:49.192 --> 48:50.692
It needs a living host.

48:50.694 --> 48:51.891
Living host?

48:51.893 --> 48:53.895
What about the samples
back at the base?

48:53.897 --> 48:54.995
They're all stable.

48:54.997 --> 48:56.696
For a short time.

48:56.698 --> 48:58.199
And then?

48:58.201 --> 48:59.533
Total necrosis.

48:59.535 --> 49:01.470
The blood's already
breaking down.

49:06.007 --> 49:07.377
Abraham is going to die.

49:09.511 --> 49:11.444
When were you going
to tell me this?

49:11.446 --> 49:13.413
I wanted to, believe me.

49:13.415 --> 49:16.317
But with the Gila surfacing
and racing to save you...

49:16.319 --> 49:18.752
Oh, bullshit!

49:18.754 --> 49:20.221
What else are you
not telling me?

49:20.223 --> 49:21.591
Nothing.

49:22.892 --> 49:24.891
That's not true.

49:24.893 --> 49:26.127
Look me in the eye.

49:26.129 --> 49:27.761
- Ah...
- No!

49:27.763 --> 49:30.864
Look at me, Eva!

49:30.866 --> 49:33.303
What the hell did you do?

49:38.140 --> 49:39.709
Abraham.

49:41.611 --> 49:44.614
You injected him, didn't you?

49:46.149 --> 49:50.583
You injected him and then
erased the surveillance videos.

49:50.585 --> 49:53.687
Abraham didn't destroy
the cameras back at the bunker.

49:53.689 --> 49:57.357
You did! Why?

49:57.359 --> 49:59.460
We were running out of time!

49:59.462 --> 50:01.962
I did what was necessary
to keep the entity alive!

50:01.964 --> 50:03.397
You sacrificed Abraham!

50:03.399 --> 50:06.468
Sometimes sacrifices
are necessary, Milaya!

50:09.872 --> 50:11.272
Lenin?

50:11.274 --> 50:12.409
Me.

50:13.643 --> 50:18.779
For all your education,
all your brilliance,

50:18.781 --> 50:20.517
you haven't learned
anything at all.

50:25.422 --> 50:29.156
Doctors, I'm Captain James Tsao,
Special Recon.

50:29.158 --> 50:30.326
Is everything all right?

50:31.893 --> 50:33.795
From Langley?

50:33.797 --> 50:35.161
I remember you.

50:35.163 --> 50:36.529
What are you doing here?

50:36.531 --> 50:38.333
Same thing you are,
hunting that monkey.

50:38.335 --> 50:40.333
We received a report
you'd set down.

50:40.335 --> 50:42.101
We came to assist.

50:42.103 --> 50:45.373
Thank you, but we don't
need your assistance.

50:45.375 --> 50:47.641
As you can see,
what she means, Captain,

50:47.643 --> 50:49.643
is that the area is clear.

50:49.645 --> 50:53.181
This is a wild duck chase,
as you Americans say.

50:53.183 --> 50:56.150
Goose, wild goose.

50:56.152 --> 50:58.986
Sir?

50:58.988 --> 50:59.987
Over here!

50:59.989 --> 51:04.158
Looks like blood, sir.

51:04.160 --> 51:05.725
I wouldn't.

51:05.727 --> 51:07.362
There's a Gila monster
the size of a space shuttle

51:07.364 --> 51:09.864
burrowing through West Virginia
because it touched that stuff.

51:09.866 --> 51:11.864
Back off, Harker!

51:11.866 --> 51:15.703
As you can see, Captain,
there's nothing here.

51:15.705 --> 51:18.406
If he was here,
he's long gone now.

51:18.408 --> 51:20.507
We appreciate your
medical advice, doctors.

51:20.509 --> 51:23.377
But as for the target,
we'll see for ourselves.

51:23.379 --> 51:24.377
If you'll excuse us.

51:24.379 --> 51:25.748
Move out!

51:28.250 --> 51:29.585
You're off my team.

51:56.377 --> 52:00.015
It's here.
I can feel it.

52:01.716 --> 52:04.551
How does an ape get to be
the size of a blimp, Cap?

52:04.553 --> 52:06.252
That's not
your concern, soldier.

52:06.254 --> 52:07.721
Yeah, you're right.

52:07.723 --> 52:10.927
It doesn't matter how
as long as it burns.

52:14.763 --> 52:15.731
Abraham?

52:17.167 --> 52:19.366
Target located.

52:19.368 --> 52:20.768
Sir?
What if it's the girls?

52:20.770 --> 52:22.972
Collateral damage.

52:27.977 --> 52:30.676
- Got him! Cover our flank!
- Come on!

52:30.678 --> 52:33.013
Let's get it together.
We got a date with...

52:44.326 --> 52:46.062
Abraham!

53:13.288 --> 53:15.121
<i>This is a critical situation.</i>

53:15.123 --> 53:18.991
<i>Do you understand what will
happen if we don't stop this?</i>

53:18.993 --> 53:20.861
And why didn't
you tranquilize him?

53:20.863 --> 53:23.730
Dr. Kuleshov
had the tranquilizer,

53:23.732 --> 53:25.399
as I already explained.

53:25.401 --> 53:26.866
We split up.

53:26.868 --> 53:28.734
I presume she broke away
to pursue the Gila monster.

53:28.736 --> 53:30.638
But I haven't been
able to reach her.

53:30.640 --> 53:33.875
This is why girls
should not be in combat!

53:33.877 --> 53:35.875
Call me girl one more time!

53:35.877 --> 53:38.612
People, this is the Pentagon!

53:38.614 --> 53:41.848
If you want to fight,
go to Capitol Hill.

53:41.850 --> 53:45.085
Now where is Dr. Kuleshov?

53:45.087 --> 53:47.388
Like I said,
I lost contact with her.

53:47.390 --> 53:49.156
After the Special Forces
team was routed.

53:49.158 --> 53:50.826
You mean slaughtered!

53:51.960 --> 53:53.294
Let's not lose
the thread here.

53:53.296 --> 53:54.694
Kuleshov is officially missing

53:54.696 --> 53:56.929
and our Apache helicopter's
not been found.

53:56.931 --> 53:59.966
Do you have any idea
where she might have gone?

53:59.968 --> 54:01.335
No, sir.

54:01.337 --> 54:02.603
Either she's... KIA...

54:02.605 --> 54:04.605
Or she doesn't want
to be found.

54:04.607 --> 54:07.841
<i>Dr. Kuleshov is not
important right now.</i>

54:07.843 --> 54:11.444
<i>If she is dead,
then she died for the cause.</i>

54:11.446 --> 54:13.446
<i>We should focus
on task at hand.</i>

54:13.448 --> 54:14.948
<i>Where is this chimp?</i>

54:14.950 --> 54:17.116
I conducted a thorough sweep
of the immediate area

54:17.118 --> 54:18.252
after I was picked up.

54:18.254 --> 54:19.453
No sign.

54:19.455 --> 54:21.321
And the giant lizard?

54:21.323 --> 54:24.126
Went underground after
it entered West Virginia.

54:30.732 --> 54:34.368
Sure does seem like the lizard
is going after the ape.

54:34.370 --> 54:36.002
Looking for a fight!

54:36.004 --> 54:37.703
<i>Maybe that's for the best.</i>

54:37.705 --> 54:40.975
<i>After all, they can do
what you could not:</i>

54:40.977 --> 54:42.275
<i>kill each other.</i>

54:42.277 --> 54:44.444
Maybe on your soil, Comrade.

54:44.446 --> 54:47.315
Those two beasts
start going at it,

54:47.317 --> 54:48.982
we're going to pay the price.

54:48.984 --> 54:51.786
I don't believe they're being
led towards each other.

54:51.788 --> 54:53.219
They're not natural enemies.

54:53.221 --> 54:55.589
And you know this because
you've worked

54:55.591 --> 54:59.027
with giant, unearthly
beasts before?

55:00.663 --> 55:02.196
Marcos, assemble your team.

55:02.198 --> 55:05.199
Let's try and box these
MFA fighters

55:05.201 --> 55:08.469
into some remote area
in Shenandoah Park.

55:08.471 --> 55:11.105
Minimize the damage that way.

55:11.107 --> 55:13.708
Do what we must to neutralize
the Gila monster,

55:13.710 --> 55:15.308
but prioritize
Abraham's capture.

55:15.310 --> 55:16.743
Here we go.

55:16.745 --> 55:20.647
It is his capture
that is essential...

55:20.649 --> 55:23.986
or the horror we're facing now
will only just be the beginning.

55:44.439 --> 55:45.437
My God.

55:45.439 --> 55:48.275
Jones, get over here!

55:48.277 --> 55:49.710
What do you want?

55:49.712 --> 55:51.911
We've always known that
the Gila monster emits

55:51.913 --> 55:53.346
an intense cosmic glow

55:53.348 --> 55:55.915
stemming from its exposure
to the alien substance.

55:55.917 --> 55:59.018
Not... Although naked
to the visible eye,

55:59.020 --> 56:01.455
the same emittance is
detectable within Abraham,

56:01.457 --> 56:03.623
albeit at much lower levels.

56:03.625 --> 56:05.558
And that this emittance
is internal,

56:05.560 --> 56:10.397
emerging from the bodies of the
animals in question, correct?

56:10.399 --> 56:12.699
- Correct.
- Incorrect.

56:12.701 --> 56:14.600
Check this.

56:14.602 --> 56:17.404
Every occurrence from
the Gila monster's attack

56:17.406 --> 56:22.408
on the train to my last
encounter with Abraham.

56:22.410 --> 56:24.143
I don't understand.
What am I looking at?

56:24.145 --> 56:26.145
I upgraded our
sky mapping system

56:26.147 --> 56:29.348
based on the cellular pattern
of the alien substance.

56:29.350 --> 56:31.850
That seems like an excessive
amount of work.

56:31.852 --> 56:33.721
I suspected something.

56:33.723 --> 56:35.823
Look, right here.

56:35.825 --> 56:38.558
These are distinct beams
of extraterrestrial energy,

56:38.560 --> 56:41.194
definitely incoming.

56:41.196 --> 56:45.199
They were there all along.
We just couldn't see them.

56:45.201 --> 56:48.034
Wait, but these are going
from New Mexico to Virginia.

56:48.036 --> 56:50.304
Yeah, confirming our theory

56:50.306 --> 56:54.607
that the quakes there
were Gila-monster-related.

56:54.609 --> 56:58.379
So you're saying that the...

56:58.381 --> 57:00.946
the glow contains
the same elemental properties

57:00.948 --> 57:03.583
as the Gila monster...

57:03.585 --> 57:07.721
- ...and the green substance.
- And our readings off Abraham?

57:07.723 --> 57:08.955
Yes.

57:08.957 --> 57:11.857
But what are they?

57:11.859 --> 57:14.997
I believe
it's a guidance system.

57:17.565 --> 57:19.065
A what?

57:19.067 --> 57:21.768
Abraham and the Gila monster

57:21.770 --> 57:24.006
are being directed
via remote control.

57:27.143 --> 57:29.310
You've lost your mind.
It's happened. It's official.

57:29.312 --> 57:32.348
It's all right there.
I'm 100% certain.

57:35.017 --> 57:36.216
Yeah, you've lost your mind.

57:36.218 --> 57:37.417
Look!

57:37.419 --> 57:38.919
The green substance is
in their blood stream.

57:38.921 --> 57:40.219
And if the aliens can
control that,

57:40.221 --> 57:41.922
they can control
their every move.

57:41.924 --> 57:43.726
It's incredible.

57:50.966 --> 57:52.766
Okay. Where and by what?

57:52.768 --> 57:54.567
I ordered Hubble
to provide visuals

57:54.569 --> 57:55.935
detailing point of origin.

57:55.937 --> 57:57.404
We should get them shortly.

57:57.406 --> 58:01.975
But the last beam originated
from this location.

58:01.977 --> 58:03.844
The Andromeda Galaxy.

58:03.846 --> 58:06.379
2.5 million light years away,

58:06.381 --> 58:08.181
and the Milky Way's
closest neighbor.

58:09.419 --> 58:10.551
Hello?

58:10.553 --> 58:12.486
Copy.

58:12.488 --> 58:13.888
Thank you.

58:13.890 --> 58:15.255
From Hubble.

58:15.257 --> 58:16.056
Images coming in.

58:16.058 --> 58:17.460
Put it up on the big screen.

58:20.629 --> 58:21.998
Good God!

58:24.065 --> 58:26.333
How do we defend against this?

58:26.335 --> 58:28.067
EDI.

58:28.069 --> 58:31.038
The Extraterrestrial
Defense Initiative

58:31.040 --> 58:34.408
was created for just such
a purpose, First Secretary.

58:34.410 --> 58:37.143
However, the EDI Operations
Center was destroyed

58:37.145 --> 58:38.779
when Abraham escaped
from Langley.

58:38.781 --> 58:40.880
My understanding
it was under repair.

58:40.882 --> 58:44.451
Not until further
appropriations are approved.

58:44.453 --> 58:47.054
Calm down, General.

58:47.056 --> 58:49.621
- More politics?
- <i>This is unacceptable.</i>

58:49.623 --> 58:52.658
<i>I need you to do something,
not just sit there.</i>

58:52.660 --> 58:55.328
So we're looking at
two remote-controlled monsters

58:55.330 --> 58:58.698
guided by an alien mothership
headed for earth?

58:58.700 --> 59:00.167
No.

59:00.169 --> 59:02.036
The Gila monster is
definitely being controlled,

59:02.038 --> 59:05.205
but Abraham's signal is weak.

59:05.207 --> 59:08.074
I think he's resisting control.

59:08.076 --> 59:11.247
Irregardless,
this is war, gentlemen!

59:13.381 --> 59:14.948
Intergalactic combat!

59:14.950 --> 59:16.750
Careful, General.

59:16.752 --> 59:20.554
I do believe you're drooling.

59:20.556 --> 59:22.723
Dad?

59:22.725 --> 59:25.558
What are you doing here?

59:25.560 --> 59:27.027
As I said earlier, doctor,

59:27.029 --> 59:30.563
reinforcements are needed,
particularly now.

59:30.565 --> 59:32.966
Well, hello, my daughter.

59:32.968 --> 59:35.502
Nothing to say?

59:35.504 --> 59:36.971
I'm working on it.

59:36.973 --> 59:39.339
Put aside your differences.
We need to get to work.

59:39.341 --> 59:41.341
We need to know what
the next move is gonna be.

59:41.343 --> 59:44.944
We can't afford
any more surprises.

59:44.946 --> 59:46.478
Yes, sir.

59:46.480 --> 59:51.120
Dr. Noah Murphy and I
will head back to Langley now.

1:00:02.531 --> 1:00:03.498
I don't need your help.

1:00:05.801 --> 1:00:07.000
Self-sufficiency.

1:00:07.002 --> 1:00:08.969
I am so proud of you.

1:00:08.971 --> 1:00:12.172
You don't have the right.

1:00:12.174 --> 1:00:15.375
Indeed, I failed you,
Linda, and I am sorry.

1:00:15.377 --> 1:00:20.214
And to add insult to injury,
Elbe was an embarrassment.

1:00:20.216 --> 1:00:23.482
A mission to have first contact

1:00:23.484 --> 1:00:27.422
that misses is like a boomerang
that just never comes back.

1:00:28.924 --> 1:00:31.190
This one did.

1:00:31.192 --> 1:00:33.527
Eh, a little too late.

1:00:33.529 --> 1:00:37.567
The powers that be don't share
the patience of scientists.

1:00:40.035 --> 1:00:42.368
Then you ran away
from everything.

1:00:42.370 --> 1:00:44.938
Listen, Linda,
you and your mother

1:00:44.940 --> 1:00:47.841
were much better off without me.

1:00:47.843 --> 1:00:50.544
Now, from
an empirical perspective,

1:00:50.546 --> 1:00:53.413
you have to agree with me.

1:00:53.415 --> 1:00:58.484
I'm not sure I concur
with your findings, doctor.

1:00:58.486 --> 1:01:00.386
Be that as it may,

1:01:00.388 --> 1:01:02.054
what we have on our hands now

1:01:02.056 --> 1:01:05.194
supersedes any
of our personal issues.

1:01:08.029 --> 1:01:10.096
I'm here at the request
of the government

1:01:10.098 --> 1:01:13.199
to do whatever I can to help.

1:01:13.201 --> 1:01:16.670
Look, your work
on cellular tracking

1:01:16.672 --> 1:01:19.071
is groundbreaking, Linda.

1:01:19.073 --> 1:01:21.875
At least it gives us
a fighting chance.

1:01:21.877 --> 1:01:25.281
The question is how do we use
this information against them?

1:01:29.518 --> 1:01:32.085
I believe if they're
being controlled by a signal,

1:01:32.087 --> 1:01:34.554
that that signal
can be interrupted.

1:01:34.556 --> 1:01:37.891
Are you saying,
cut the transmission

1:01:37.893 --> 1:01:39.725
and render them rudderless?

1:01:39.727 --> 1:01:41.460
Of course!

1:01:41.462 --> 1:01:44.129
That's to assume they have
no will of their own.

1:01:44.131 --> 1:01:46.232
I believe Abraham does.

1:01:46.234 --> 1:01:48.801
He's not acting with malice.

1:01:48.803 --> 1:01:50.636
He only strikes when provoked.

1:01:50.638 --> 1:01:53.540
Regardless, cutting
the cable is key.

1:01:53.542 --> 1:01:59.411
I believe it's possible
to shoot a disruptive pulse

1:01:59.413 --> 1:02:02.650
and cut right through
the alien beams.

1:02:02.652 --> 1:02:04.917
A bio-electric counter-measure.

1:02:04.919 --> 1:02:07.721
Just a question of time.

1:02:07.723 --> 1:02:10.259
Time we don't have.

1:02:13.194 --> 1:02:15.495
Where are
the targets currently headed?

1:02:15.497 --> 1:02:18.531
They appear
to be converging, sir.

1:02:18.533 --> 1:02:20.266
Where?

1:02:20.268 --> 1:02:21.567
Come on, man, where?

1:02:21.569 --> 1:02:24.140
I don't know!
Washington, D.C.

1:02:27.142 --> 1:02:28.611
That certainly
doesn't help matters.

1:02:34.049 --> 1:02:35.949
But why?

1:02:35.951 --> 1:02:39.121
Up until this point, they've
been moving independently.

1:02:41.756 --> 1:02:45.357
Possibly, but whomever
is controlling them,

1:02:45.359 --> 1:02:48.361
the target makes
strategic sense.

1:02:48.363 --> 1:02:50.163
With the Capitol in shambles,

1:02:50.165 --> 1:02:52.000
the country tumbles
into chaos...

1:02:59.507 --> 1:03:02.408
Possibly the world following.

1:03:02.410 --> 1:03:04.980
I don't believe
Abraham is a drone.

1:03:06.915 --> 1:03:11.250
You've always had a special
deep affection for that simian.

1:03:11.252 --> 1:03:13.021
Yeah, maybe I should never
have brought you here.

1:03:15.725 --> 1:03:20.359
If you hadn't, I would have
never became a scientist.

1:03:20.361 --> 1:03:23.698
And for that,
I will always be grateful.

1:03:26.669 --> 1:03:30.804
But Abraham, he is not
like that Gila monster.

1:03:30.806 --> 1:03:34.607
He wasn't exposed to the alien
toxins in the same manner.

1:03:34.609 --> 1:03:37.511
But those toxins
were also injected

1:03:37.513 --> 1:03:41.714
directly into him
by your Russian partner.

1:03:41.716 --> 1:03:42.651
She's not my partner!

1:03:45.087 --> 1:03:48.288
Nevertheless, he now has
more toxins, as you say,

1:03:48.290 --> 1:03:49.922
within his system,

1:03:49.924 --> 1:03:54.527
toxins that my make him more
susceptible to alien command.

1:03:54.529 --> 1:03:57.163
I believe that
his signal is weaker.

1:03:57.165 --> 1:03:59.833
Abraham is resisting control.

1:03:59.835 --> 1:04:03.502
You mean, you hope,

1:04:03.504 --> 1:04:06.307
and hope, Linda,
is not a strategy.

1:04:12.247 --> 1:04:15.617
Sometimes hope
is the only strategy.

1:04:18.652 --> 1:04:21.420
Doctors?

1:04:21.422 --> 1:04:23.591
I think we've got a problem.

1:04:24.560 --> 1:04:27.196
ISS just sent us this video.

1:04:33.134 --> 1:04:35.504
What were you saying
about hope?

1:04:54.221 --> 1:04:56.325
<i>Did anyone else just see that?</i>

1:04:57.424 --> 1:05:00.993
<i>My God, it's really happening!</i>

1:05:00.995 --> 1:05:03.198
<i>Call the Pentagon, now!</i>

1:05:05.834 --> 1:05:07.199
<i>What are you doing?</i>

1:05:07.201 --> 1:05:08.868
<i>You must contain this.</i>

1:05:08.870 --> 1:05:10.337
What's going on?

1:05:10.339 --> 1:05:12.739
High alert.

1:05:12.741 --> 1:05:13.839
Abraham?

1:05:13.841 --> 1:05:16.676
We're dealing
with spaceships now.

1:05:16.678 --> 1:05:19.245
Hovering over
the Pacific Islands.

1:05:19.247 --> 1:05:21.114
They're heading towards D.C.

1:05:21.116 --> 1:05:22.781
Abraham, the Gila monster,

1:05:22.783 --> 1:05:24.317
the ship, all of them,

1:05:24.319 --> 1:05:25.819
they're heading towards D.C.

1:05:25.821 --> 1:05:27.087
And you know this because?

1:05:27.089 --> 1:05:28.721
There's no question.

1:05:28.723 --> 1:05:30.890
And the alien mothership
is right behind them.

1:05:30.892 --> 1:05:32.324
Based on our calculations,

1:05:32.326 --> 1:05:34.025
they'll all be upon
the city in six hours.

1:05:34.027 --> 1:05:35.495
Attacking the Capitol!

1:05:35.497 --> 1:05:36.295
No.

1:05:36.297 --> 1:05:37.864
Disrupting the chain of command,

1:05:37.866 --> 1:05:41.167
giving them an opportunity
to organize a strike force.

1:05:41.169 --> 1:05:42.935
And demoralize the nation.

1:05:42.937 --> 1:05:46.406
<i>I don't think propaganda is
part of alien agenda, General.</i>

1:05:46.408 --> 1:05:49.109
We will unleash
the unholy hell

1:05:49.111 --> 1:05:50.777
from the U.S. fighting force!

1:05:50.779 --> 1:05:54.045
Your tank was wiped out
in one swift swoop, General.

1:05:54.047 --> 1:05:56.315
Tanks are Tinker Toys!

1:05:56.317 --> 1:05:58.185
Our new supersonic
cruise missiles

1:05:58.187 --> 1:05:59.618
will punch enough holes
in those suckers,

1:05:59.620 --> 1:06:02.589
they'll wish they never
came to this planet!

1:06:02.591 --> 1:06:03.692
Gentlemen?

1:06:05.192 --> 1:06:06.826
They're both from this planet!

1:06:06.828 --> 1:06:09.462
The truth, sir, is we don't
know what Abraham will do.

1:06:09.464 --> 1:06:11.531
He may not be under
total control of the aliens.

1:06:11.533 --> 1:06:13.799
We have to assume the worst.

1:06:13.801 --> 1:06:17.337
<i>What else can we do to
prevent destruction of city?</i>

1:06:17.339 --> 1:06:20.306
We've worked up
a bio-electric formula

1:06:20.308 --> 1:06:22.442
that could interrupt
the alien transmissions

1:06:22.444 --> 1:06:24.911
that control the creatures.

1:06:24.913 --> 1:06:28.246
I'm requesting permission
to install the transmitter

1:06:28.248 --> 1:06:31.051
on top of
the Washington Monument.

1:06:31.053 --> 1:06:32.419
That's great!
See to it.

1:06:32.421 --> 1:06:33.719
There's no time to lose.

1:06:33.721 --> 1:06:35.554
Let's do it.

1:06:35.556 --> 1:06:37.589
It's the best chance
we've got.

1:06:37.591 --> 1:06:38.826
Let's just hope it works.

1:06:40.328 --> 1:06:41.797
He might be a genius.

1:06:48.370 --> 1:06:50.404
<i>Delaney,
the transmitter has been</i>

1:06:50.406 --> 1:06:51.971
<i>attached to the monument.</i>

1:06:51.973 --> 1:06:54.375
<i>The signal will begin
broadcasting shortly.</i>

1:06:57.346 --> 1:07:01.181
Sir, we have a visual
on the target!

1:07:01.183 --> 1:07:02.614
Fire!

1:07:02.616 --> 1:07:05.284
Give that monkey
all you got right now!

1:07:05.286 --> 1:07:07.323
Over there!
Left quadrant!

1:07:14.395 --> 1:07:16.295
Okay, thank you.

1:07:16.297 --> 1:07:19.065
It's within the city limits.

1:07:19.067 --> 1:07:21.033
How long before we transmit?

1:07:21.035 --> 1:07:21.970
30 seconds.

1:07:23.471 --> 1:07:26.640
You know, I used to dream
of living in a world

1:07:26.642 --> 1:07:30.312
where you touch the stars and
hold hands with those beyond,

1:07:31.980 --> 1:07:34.047
And I...

1:07:34.049 --> 1:07:35.982
I dream of you,

1:07:35.984 --> 1:07:38.284
not my adopted daughter,

1:07:38.286 --> 1:07:40.888
my own flesh and blood
beside me.

1:07:44.493 --> 1:07:47.127
You got part of it right, Dad,

1:07:47.129 --> 1:07:48.663
maybe the most important part.

1:07:54.069 --> 1:07:55.467
Dr. Murphy!

1:07:55.469 --> 1:07:57.304
- Yes?
- Yes?

1:07:57.306 --> 1:07:58.870
Status, status?

1:07:58.872 --> 1:08:00.741
The transmitter
is up and running.

1:08:00.743 --> 1:08:02.509
Eisenstein, how much longer

1:08:02.511 --> 1:08:06.478
until they're free
from alien control?

1:08:06.480 --> 1:08:09.149
I estimate the alien's beam
is at 11...

1:08:09.151 --> 1:08:11.616
no, 10% strength
over Abraham.

1:08:11.618 --> 1:08:14.487
He is almost free already.

1:08:14.489 --> 1:08:17.022
Abraham's still
holding about 10%.

1:08:17.024 --> 1:08:18.292
Excellent.

1:08:18.294 --> 1:08:20.226
It's working, Dad.
You did it.

1:08:20.228 --> 1:08:22.561
Well, we'll see, we'll see.

1:08:22.563 --> 1:08:24.463
What's the timetable?

1:08:24.465 --> 1:08:25.999
It's hard to say.

1:08:26.001 --> 1:08:29.002
If Abraham is in more
possession of his faculties,

1:08:29.004 --> 1:08:31.003
we might be able
to free him sooner.

1:08:31.005 --> 1:08:33.539
Eisenstein says
we're at eight percent now.

1:08:33.541 --> 1:08:35.475
Almost there...

1:08:35.477 --> 1:08:36.711
What about the Gila monster?

1:08:38.246 --> 1:08:40.312
He's resisting.

1:08:40.314 --> 1:08:42.647
The transmitter must not be
able to reach him underground.

1:08:42.649 --> 1:08:45.054
Eisenstein,
what's the percentage?

1:08:48.756 --> 1:08:51.124
Alien control
of Gila monster

1:08:51.126 --> 1:08:52.959
is holding at 90%.

1:08:52.961 --> 1:08:55.093
90%? That much?

1:08:55.095 --> 1:08:56.464
Damn it!

1:08:58.465 --> 1:08:59.865
Patience, Linda, patience.
Give it time.

1:08:59.867 --> 1:09:01.767
That's one luxury
we can't afford.

1:09:01.769 --> 1:09:04.003
Eisenstein, please tell me
you know where this thing is.

1:09:04.005 --> 1:09:06.371
Hard to say,
his signal is weak.

1:09:06.373 --> 1:09:08.542
The Gila's signal has spiked!
It's about to emerge!

1:09:08.544 --> 1:09:11.843
<i>Excuse me?
Did I hear that right?</i>

1:09:11.845 --> 1:09:16.083
She said the Gila...
is about to emerge.

1:09:16.085 --> 1:09:17.484
Where?

1:09:56.457 --> 1:09:58.457
Gentlemen...

1:09:58.459 --> 1:09:59.728
We have a new target.

1:10:00.595 --> 1:10:03.029
I don't see Abraham!

1:10:03.031 --> 1:10:05.897
<i>Eisenstein,
what's Abraham's status?</i>

1:10:05.899 --> 1:10:08.100
Abraham is completely
free from control!

1:10:08.102 --> 1:10:11.036
But without alien signal,
his location is unclear.

1:10:11.038 --> 1:10:12.304
Abraham is free!

1:10:12.306 --> 1:10:14.539
But he must have run away.
We should do the same.

1:10:14.541 --> 1:10:15.740
Linda, you don't
need to be here.

1:10:15.742 --> 1:10:16.776
You're not a soldier.

1:10:16.778 --> 1:10:18.276
Damn right. Come on!

1:10:18.278 --> 1:10:20.446
No.

1:10:20.448 --> 1:10:23.383
I'm a scientist,
just like my father.

1:10:23.385 --> 1:10:25.284
Real cute, but now's
not the time. Come on.

1:10:25.286 --> 1:10:27.587
Linda, let's get out of...

1:10:27.589 --> 1:10:29.556
Wait a minute, do you hear that?

1:10:38.532 --> 1:10:41.803
There he is!
Hit that ape!

1:10:45.372 --> 1:10:47.306
No! Don't shoot him!

1:10:47.308 --> 1:10:50.776
Stop! Abraham is no longer
under alien control!

1:10:50.778 --> 1:10:52.311
Hold your fire on the monument!

1:10:52.313 --> 1:10:53.678
Abraham is not a threat!

1:10:53.680 --> 1:10:57.016
I repeat, Abraham
is not a threat!

1:10:57.018 --> 1:10:59.922
And we're making sure
of that, baby doll!

1:11:05.894 --> 1:11:07.526
Asshole.

1:11:07.528 --> 1:11:08.828
Fire!

1:11:08.830 --> 1:11:10.463
Our countermeasure's
are over there.

1:11:10.465 --> 1:11:13.633
That cowboy's liable
to bungle the whole show.

1:11:13.635 --> 1:11:17.603
Come on!
Knock that bastard down!

1:11:17.605 --> 1:11:21.143
Come on!
Blow him to smithereens, I say!

1:11:24.479 --> 1:11:26.148
I'll be dipped in pig shit!

1:11:28.582 --> 1:11:30.249
<i>I have bad news...</i>

1:11:30.251 --> 1:11:33.555
<i>Alien beam has regained
control of Abraham.</i>

1:11:34.822 --> 1:11:36.388
The longer the signal
is down,

1:11:36.390 --> 1:11:39.292
the more mindless and
destructive he will become.

1:11:39.294 --> 1:11:42.495
Without the signal, we lose
the only chance we still had.

1:11:42.497 --> 1:11:43.728
Tell me there's
another transmitter,

1:11:43.730 --> 1:11:44.731
prototype, anything!

1:11:44.733 --> 1:11:46.265
A prototype, yes,

1:11:46.267 --> 1:11:48.535
but it's incomplete and
on the other side of D.C.

1:11:48.537 --> 1:11:49.936
It's too dangerous.

1:11:49.938 --> 1:11:54.774
It looks like I failed
you again, daughter.

1:11:54.776 --> 1:11:56.575
<i>Sir, we've lost
General Delaney.</i>

1:11:56.577 --> 1:11:57.910
<i>And the transmitter is down.</i>

1:11:57.912 --> 1:11:59.512
<i>What are your orders?</i>

1:11:59.514 --> 1:12:02.815
<i>What else can do to prevent
destruction of city?</i>

1:12:02.817 --> 1:12:07.020
We can't save the city.

1:12:07.022 --> 1:12:09.922
Patch me through to Dr. Murphy.

1:12:09.924 --> 1:12:13.426
<i>It's over. Get out of DC
while you still can.</i>

1:12:13.428 --> 1:12:15.727
<i>We're gonna burn the whole
place to the ground.</i>

1:12:15.729 --> 1:12:16.829
The hell with that!

1:12:16.831 --> 1:12:18.530
Now's not the time to give up.

1:12:18.532 --> 1:12:20.600
Grab your car.
Meet me out front.

1:12:20.602 --> 1:12:22.134
What?

1:12:22.136 --> 1:12:23.602
We're going after that device.

1:12:23.604 --> 1:12:25.036
Have you lost your mind?

1:12:25.038 --> 1:12:26.539
Do you not see what's
happening out there?

1:12:26.541 --> 1:12:28.607
- We're toast!
- We're going after that device!

1:12:28.609 --> 1:12:31.246
Now, Jones, go!

1:12:33.180 --> 1:12:34.213
Dad?

1:12:34.215 --> 1:12:36.048
The transmitter
is in a black box

1:12:36.050 --> 1:12:37.851
in a white van
with a beacon

1:12:37.853 --> 1:12:40.119
at the top of the City Center
parking structure.

1:12:40.121 --> 1:12:41.954
You can find it!
It's there!

1:12:41.956 --> 1:12:42.754
Okay.

1:12:42.756 --> 1:12:43.823
Then we got a chance.

1:12:43.825 --> 1:12:44.856
- Yes.
- Let's go.

1:12:44.858 --> 1:12:46.726
Wait! What are you doing?

1:12:46.728 --> 1:12:47.793
I'm getting you to safety.

1:12:47.795 --> 1:12:48.793
I'm not leaving you up here.

1:12:48.795 --> 1:12:50.096
Linda, look around.

1:12:50.098 --> 1:12:52.432
Inside, outside,
the danger's everywhere.

1:12:52.434 --> 1:12:54.100
I belong here.

1:12:54.102 --> 1:12:56.168
This is the best vantage
point in the city.

1:12:56.170 --> 1:12:58.304
I can give you live updates
on the location

1:12:58.306 --> 1:12:59.737
of the Gila monster and Abraham.

1:12:59.739 --> 1:13:02.674
Go. Get the job done.

1:13:02.676 --> 1:13:04.045
I'll be with you the whole way.

1:13:27.402 --> 1:13:29.171
Get in the car.

1:13:35.710 --> 1:13:37.410
Hit it!

1:13:37.412 --> 1:13:38.347
You got it, boss.

1:13:41.382 --> 1:13:42.548
Whoa.

1:13:42.550 --> 1:13:44.950
Easy there, Bullitt.

1:13:44.952 --> 1:13:46.651
I've been dying to do this.

1:13:46.653 --> 1:13:47.986
Do what?

1:13:47.988 --> 1:13:49.789
Drive like a maniac
with complete and utter

1:13:49.791 --> 1:13:51.226
disregard for all authority.

1:13:55.595 --> 1:13:57.262
Don't get cocky.

1:13:57.264 --> 1:13:59.767
The Gila monster still has the
authority until we cut his cord.

1:14:03.470 --> 1:14:05.437
Good thing they've already
evacuated this place.

1:14:06.907 --> 1:14:08.774
Isn't that
always how it goes?

1:14:08.776 --> 1:14:10.442
Politicians go first
in their helicopters

1:14:10.444 --> 1:14:12.344
while they leave
the rest of us here to fry.

1:14:12.346 --> 1:14:16.548
She's doing what?
Get me Murphy!

1:14:16.550 --> 1:14:19.119
<i>What are you doing to help
contain this monster?</i>

1:14:19.121 --> 1:14:21.286
<i>You should be using
nuclear weapons.</i>

1:14:21.288 --> 1:14:22.888
Speak of the devil.

1:14:22.890 --> 1:14:25.490
Murphy, I understand you're on
some kind of suicide mission.

1:14:25.492 --> 1:14:26.758
Explain.

1:14:26.760 --> 1:14:28.393
Suicide is
not our intention, sir.

1:14:28.395 --> 1:14:30.797
<i>A prototype of the device
my father created</i>

1:14:30.799 --> 1:14:32.698
<i>to sever alien control
from the monsters</i>

1:14:32.700 --> 1:14:34.102
is somewhere in a van.

1:14:35.937 --> 1:14:37.369
Sounds pretty futile, Murphy.

1:14:37.371 --> 1:14:39.004
Isn't there any other
course of action?

1:14:39.006 --> 1:14:40.106
What's your father say?

1:14:40.108 --> 1:14:41.908
<i>Dad, what's your take?</i>

1:14:41.910 --> 1:14:44.043
<i>Restore the transmitter,
cut the signal,</i>

1:14:44.045 --> 1:14:46.079
<i>and the destruction stops.</i>

1:14:46.081 --> 1:14:48.313
<i>It might stop
the alien ship, too.</i>

1:14:48.315 --> 1:14:49.214
My father concurs.

1:14:49.216 --> 1:14:50.682
<i>Murphy, you make a good point.</i>

1:14:50.684 --> 1:14:52.250
The road!

1:14:53.388 --> 1:14:55.890
He's right behind us.
Step on it!

1:14:56.657 --> 1:14:58.190
Doing the best I can!

1:14:58.192 --> 1:15:00.860
<i>Murphy!
Are you still there?</i>

1:15:00.862 --> 1:15:02.861
For all intents and purposes.

1:15:02.863 --> 1:15:05.063
<i>The device is
in an indestructible box.</i>

1:15:05.065 --> 1:15:06.531
fitted with a tracking device.

1:15:06.533 --> 1:15:09.602
It's our only hope
to gain the upper hand.

1:15:09.604 --> 1:15:13.039
We have to find that device.

1:15:13.041 --> 1:15:15.540
I like your spirit, Murphy.
Let's hope it's enough.

1:15:15.542 --> 1:15:16.741
Do you need any support?

1:15:16.743 --> 1:15:17.776
Troops or equipment?

1:15:17.778 --> 1:15:19.512
Negative, sir.

1:15:19.514 --> 1:15:23.348
I've got all the backup I need.

1:15:23.350 --> 1:15:25.383
Get the job done,
and God be with you.

1:15:25.385 --> 1:15:27.619
Now you sound
like my father, sir.

1:15:27.621 --> 1:15:29.754
I'll take that as a compliment.

1:15:29.756 --> 1:15:31.225
<i>Marcos out.</i>

1:15:32.760 --> 1:15:34.660
Hang a right at the next light.

1:15:34.662 --> 1:15:37.031
Right.
I said right!

1:15:39.099 --> 1:15:40.967
Don't tell me where
to drive, by the way.

1:15:40.969 --> 1:15:43.203
I know this town like
the back of my hand, okay?

1:15:43.205 --> 1:15:44.169
All right, okay.

1:15:44.171 --> 1:15:46.071
It's directly up ahead.

1:15:46.073 --> 1:15:48.210
Park it... park it over there.

1:15:52.413 --> 1:15:54.813
Sure about that?

1:15:54.815 --> 1:15:56.316
Nothing's sure
in science, Jones.

1:15:56.318 --> 1:15:59.154
You know that...
until it's proven.

1:16:04.090 --> 1:16:06.357
It's up there!
Probably near the roof!

1:16:06.359 --> 1:16:09.427
Of course it is.
Great! Fantastic!

1:16:09.429 --> 1:16:11.129
The Gila monster
is getting closer!

1:16:11.131 --> 1:16:12.466
Hey! Wait, wait, wait.

1:16:14.568 --> 1:16:16.270
There it is.

1:16:27.715 --> 1:16:29.017
It's there!

1:16:31.118 --> 1:16:32.353
How are we gonna get in?

1:16:35.656 --> 1:16:36.992
Ah!

1:16:44.564 --> 1:16:47.301
They make that look
so much easier in the movies.

1:16:50.604 --> 1:16:52.540
Incomplete is right.

1:16:54.108 --> 1:16:56.178
Where's the auxiliary
power source...

1:16:59.679 --> 1:17:02.647
Damn it! Jones, see if the car
has a compression filter.

1:17:02.649 --> 1:17:04.249
Wait a minute, got it!

1:17:04.251 --> 1:17:07.018
<i>Hurry up, Murphy!
We don't have much time.</i>

1:17:07.020 --> 1:17:08.788
Gunships are on standby.

1:17:08.790 --> 1:17:10.856
Come on... come on!

1:17:10.858 --> 1:17:11.924
Looks like it's still
functional.

1:17:11.926 --> 1:17:13.691
Do you need that filter or not?

1:17:13.693 --> 1:17:15.895
<i>Linda, you'll need to manually
bypass the motivator.</i>

1:17:15.897 --> 1:17:17.230
<i>Only then will
the signal resume.</i>

1:17:17.232 --> 1:17:19.565
<i>Is that the red
or the blue channel?</i>

1:17:19.567 --> 1:17:23.602
- This might take a minute.
- I'll keep watch.

1:17:23.604 --> 1:17:25.973
Did you know we have court side
seats to the end of the world?

1:17:28.542 --> 1:17:30.043
<i>What are you doing?</i>

1:17:30.045 --> 1:17:32.511
<i>Extraction point
is in opposite direction.</i>

1:17:32.513 --> 1:17:34.082
<i>Where are you going?</i>

1:17:35.750 --> 1:17:38.587
<i>They need all the help
they can get in Washington.</i>

1:17:40.888 --> 1:17:41.954
<i>Are you crazy?</i>

1:17:41.956 --> 1:17:43.525
<i>This is not your fight, Eva.</i>

1:17:45.059 --> 1:17:46.592
<i>How one fights...</i>

1:17:46.594 --> 1:17:50.332
<i>is just as important
as the result it yields.</i>

1:17:54.269 --> 1:17:57.302
<i>This is insubordination...</i>

1:17:57.304 --> 1:18:00.174
I'm coming, Linda.
I'm coming.

1:18:01.742 --> 1:18:04.179
Linda, you almost done?

1:18:06.915 --> 1:18:08.047
Almost got it...

1:18:08.049 --> 1:18:09.917
<i>We're running out of time.</i>

1:18:15.523 --> 1:18:17.423
<i>I know you can do it, Linda.</i>

1:18:17.425 --> 1:18:18.560
<i>I love you.</i>

1:18:24.197 --> 1:18:26.401
All right.
Here goes nothing.

1:18:27.568 --> 1:18:29.168
<i>The signal is on!</i>

1:18:29.170 --> 1:18:31.236
<i>Abraham is regaining control!</i>

1:18:31.238 --> 1:18:34.039
The Gila is holding.
And it's right on top of them.

1:18:37.444 --> 1:18:38.612
Ah!

1:18:42.450 --> 1:18:43.617
Son of a bitch.

1:18:55.696 --> 1:18:56.665
Abraham!

1:19:01.702 --> 1:19:02.868
Kick his ass!

1:19:18.653 --> 1:19:20.121
No!

1:19:21.689 --> 1:19:24.589
Linda!

1:19:24.591 --> 1:19:26.428
It's Eva.

1:19:27.127 --> 1:19:31.230
Please forgive me!

1:19:31.232 --> 1:19:34.031
There's nothing to forgive.

1:19:34.033 --> 1:19:35.202
I'm sorry, too.

1:19:36.938 --> 1:19:38.739
You did what
you thought was right.

1:19:41.276 --> 1:19:43.178
That's all I needed
to hear, Milaya.

1:19:45.285 --> 1:19:46.662
So long!

1:19:57.381 --> 1:20:02.636
Screw you, you son of a bitch!

1:20:26.086 --> 1:20:27.388
Damn it.

1:20:50.978 --> 1:20:54.146
Tell the gunships they have
my permission to fire!

1:20:54.148 --> 1:20:56.515
Linda, congratulations.

1:20:56.517 --> 1:20:58.486
I understand you've
accomplished your mission.

1:21:00.154 --> 1:21:02.420
No, wait,
I didn't do anything!

1:21:02.422 --> 1:21:05.891
Abraham killed the Gila monster!

1:21:05.893 --> 1:21:07.758
That's one down, one to go.

1:21:07.760 --> 1:21:10.362
The gunships are en route
to take that monkey out.

1:21:10.364 --> 1:21:12.498
So I suggest you get
your ass out of there.

1:21:12.500 --> 1:21:16.569
No! You don't understand!

1:21:16.571 --> 1:21:18.605
Abraham defeated the monster!

1:21:21.876 --> 1:21:25.076
Wait! No!

1:21:25.078 --> 1:21:27.482
Murphy.
Murphy, are you there?

1:21:28.616 --> 1:21:30.085
Oh, God, no.

1:21:34.755 --> 1:21:37.325
I'm sorry, Abraham.
I'm so sorry.

1:21:46.600 --> 1:21:47.999
All air units.

1:21:48.001 --> 1:21:50.535
This is National Security
Adviser Marcos, do not...

1:21:50.537 --> 1:21:52.473
I repeat, do not fire
on the simian.

1:21:53.440 --> 1:21:55.809
Copy sir, we're falling back.

1:21:56.911 --> 1:21:59.311
Sir! ISS has just confirmed,

1:21:59.313 --> 1:22:02.283
the alien spacecraft
has left our atmosphere.

1:22:09.255 --> 1:22:11.123
Are you certain, doctor?

1:22:11.125 --> 1:22:12.524
Well, according to our readings,

1:22:12.526 --> 1:22:15.326
the alien spacecraft has left
the atmosphere

1:22:15.328 --> 1:22:17.929
and is heading back
to whence it came.

1:22:17.931 --> 1:22:19.931
With their tail between
their legs, no doubt.

1:22:19.933 --> 1:22:23.134
General Delaney would
certainly be happy about that.

1:22:23.136 --> 1:22:25.404
We will continue
tracking it, of course.

1:22:25.406 --> 1:22:27.673
And the remote control
over the creatures?

1:22:27.675 --> 1:22:31.843
The felled Gila monster is
creating no signs whatsoever.

1:22:31.845 --> 1:22:32.844
Totally inactive.

1:22:32.846 --> 1:22:35.183
Cool.
And the simian?

1:22:37.718 --> 1:22:39.485
What's going on?
Where's Abraham?

1:22:39.487 --> 1:22:42.288
Linda! Linda, easy, easy.
He's going to be okay.

1:22:42.290 --> 1:22:44.156
He's going to be okay.

1:22:44.158 --> 1:22:45.891
That's what you told me
when I was nine!

1:22:45.893 --> 1:22:47.526
Now, now, now, now, look.

1:22:47.528 --> 1:22:51.797
I learned my lesson.
No more lies, no more hiding.

1:22:51.799 --> 1:22:54.866
Science smiles
only on the truth.

1:22:54.868 --> 1:22:59.174
And truth is, you were right
about Abraham all along.

1:23:01.207 --> 1:23:03.842
Multiple witnesses told me

1:23:03.844 --> 1:23:06.578
that he took down that
Gila monster singlehandedly.

1:23:06.580 --> 1:23:09.815
But... but why did you call off
the gunships

1:23:09.817 --> 1:23:11.383
if you needed further
confirmation

1:23:11.385 --> 1:23:12.853
of what I already told you?

1:23:14.455 --> 1:23:17.188
Well, my dear,
I acted on something

1:23:17.190 --> 1:23:19.525
I haven't considered
since I was a little boy.

1:23:19.527 --> 1:23:21.663
- And what's that?
- Faith.

1:23:26.233 --> 1:23:27.932
What about Abraham?

1:23:27.934 --> 1:23:29.301
Where will he go now?

1:23:29.303 --> 1:23:30.636
Doctor?

1:23:30.638 --> 1:23:33.539
Well, we found a base
out near Santa Fe

1:23:33.541 --> 1:23:37.276
we think would be the perfect
sanctuary for him...

1:23:37.278 --> 1:23:40.915
For him to heal and for the two
of you to get reacquainted.

1:23:44.218 --> 1:23:48.119
And, of course, it's the perfect
location for study.

1:23:48.121 --> 1:23:49.420
Study?

1:23:49.422 --> 1:23:51.289
What... What kind of study
and by whom?

1:23:51.291 --> 1:23:53.525
By you alone.

1:23:53.527 --> 1:23:58.463
You have total authority
on the matter if you want it.

1:23:58.465 --> 1:24:02.066
And with a little assistance
from an old man,

1:24:02.068 --> 1:24:03.337
if you'll have me.

1:24:04.538 --> 1:24:08.408
Thanks, Dad.
I'd like that very much.

1:24:28.595 --> 1:24:30.298
A hero's welcome.
