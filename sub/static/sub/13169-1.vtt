04:47.787 --> 04:51.188
You know, a lot has changed
in my life in the past year.

04:51.357 --> 04:52.949
Suzanne and I got married...

04:53.126 --> 04:55.993
...and her and the kids moved
into my apartment.

04:56.162 --> 04:59.029
My very small apartment.

05:04.937 --> 05:06.495
But that ain't all.

05:06.673 --> 05:08.664
I decided to pursue my dream.

05:08.841 --> 05:12.436
So I sold my sports shop
and started up a magazine.

05:12.612 --> 05:15.604
You know what it is.
A sports magazine.

05:15.782 --> 05:18.250
And these are the moments
that I cherish.

05:18.418 --> 05:22.514
When everybody's asleep,
I got the whole place to myself...

05:22.689 --> 05:25.453
...and now it's time to get to work.

05:46.612 --> 05:49.172
So, Magic, how was it when you...?

05:49.349 --> 05:51.681
How's your magazine coming?

05:52.752 --> 05:53.912
Come here.

05:54.087 --> 05:55.918
Kevin, what you doing up?
Trying to write.

05:56.089 --> 05:58.523
I'm hungry.
Do you got Pop-Tarts?

05:59.058 --> 06:00.582
You're always hungry.

06:00.760 --> 06:03.888
And it's, "Do we got Pop-Tarts?"
We family now.

06:04.063 --> 06:06.759
So, what's mine is yours,
and what's yours is mine.

06:06.933 --> 06:10.027
-Understand?
-I understand I want Pop-Tarts.

06:14.307 --> 06:16.104
Thanks, Nick.

06:19.278 --> 06:20.870
Did you take my cell phone?

06:23.916 --> 06:26.476
Mom, Kevin's stealing
my stuff again.

06:26.652 --> 06:27.710
Nick, Coco's hungry.

06:27.887 --> 06:30.720
Hey, you guys wanted the dog,
you gonna have to feed him.

06:30.890 --> 06:31.914
Coco, breakfast!

06:34.660 --> 06:36.787
-Good morning.
-Hey.

06:36.963 --> 06:38.760
How's your writing
going this morning?

06:38.931 --> 06:41.331
-Not too good.
-Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

06:41.501 --> 06:44.800
Nick, there's something
we really need to talk about.

06:44.971 --> 06:47.030
Hold that thought.
Hey! No! Wait a minute.

06:47.206 --> 06:49.265
No! No! No!

06:49.542 --> 06:50.736
Open this door.

06:50.910 --> 06:52.434
I have to put on my makeup, Nick.

06:52.612 --> 06:54.705
You're too young to wear makeup.

06:54.881 --> 06:56.576
Now, I'm gonna count to three.

06:56.749 --> 06:57.943
One.

06:58.117 --> 06:59.414
Two.

07:03.890 --> 07:07.087
I'm almost 1 4, Nick.
You can't keep treating me Iike a child.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.591
No, no. You're only 1 3.

07:08.761 --> 07:11.229
And as your stepfather,
I have the God-given right...

07:11.397 --> 07:12.830
...to treat you Iike a child.

07:13.099 --> 07:15.761
Suzanne, do you see
what this girl got on?

07:16.002 --> 07:17.299
I'm not in it.

07:17.470 --> 07:21.167
Okay, okay, I am not dressing
Iike somebody's grandma.

07:21.340 --> 07:24.901
After school, Ashley and I are going to
the mall for the Nordstrom sale.

07:25.478 --> 07:28.470
No. No. Veto.
That ain't gonna happen.

07:28.648 --> 07:29.808
I don't Iike that one bit.

07:29.982 --> 07:32.041
You're too young
to be hanging out at the mall.

07:32.218 --> 07:33.981
So go get dressed, granny.

07:34.153 --> 07:36.053
Too young for the mall?

07:36.222 --> 07:38.690
You're Iike a prison guard.

07:39.525 --> 07:42.619
Yeah, well, welcome to AIcatraz.

07:47.733 --> 07:51.134
So, Nick, you know,
the Lutskys are moving.

07:51.404 --> 07:54.168
-So?
-Well, it's a three-bedroom.

07:54.340 --> 07:56.968
Yeah, it's probably three times
as expensive too.

07:57.143 --> 07:58.337
Hey!

08:01.247 --> 08:05.411
Oh, you wanna be treated Iike a adult?
You can't even wrap a piece of pizza.

08:05.585 --> 08:06.950
You said I was a child.

08:07.453 --> 08:11.014
Nick, there's something that we really
need to talk about this morning.

08:11.224 --> 08:14.716
I can't talk right now.
Look at me. I'm a mess.

08:15.661 --> 08:17.151
Kevin.

08:17.330 --> 08:20.493
Okay. Out. Both you guys. Out.

08:20.666 --> 08:22.793
I got a presentation today
with my publisher.

08:22.969 --> 08:26.962
-Let's go. I need to talk to your mother.
-You too, Coco. Get out. Go.

08:27.139 --> 08:28.367
This place.

08:28.541 --> 08:31.339
Coco, get down before
you knock something over.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.349
And what were you trying to say?

08:42.355 --> 08:45.256
Honey, I'm pregnant.

08:46.392 --> 08:47.825
By who?

08:52.164 --> 08:54.530
So you sold your half
of the shop to Marty?

08:54.700 --> 08:56.429
He's gotta be happy
about that, huh?

08:56.602 --> 08:58.627
Yeah, he is. But I am too, you know?

08:59.071 --> 09:01.869
I'm starting a new chapter
in my Iife, my man.

09:02.041 --> 09:03.406
I'm Iaunching a magazine.

09:03.576 --> 09:06.204
That's great. You took a risk,
and you made it happen.

09:06.379 --> 09:07.937
You got Magic. I'm proud of you.

09:08.281 --> 09:10.146
Whoa, hey!

09:11.284 --> 09:13.081
Who said anything about Magic?

09:13.486 --> 09:14.544
You don't have him?

09:14.720 --> 09:16.051
Officially, no.

09:16.222 --> 09:18.622
But it's Iooking good.
It's Iooking real good.

09:18.791 --> 09:20.588
Matter of fact, it's Iooking so good...

09:20.760 --> 09:25.823
...pour me a shot, pour yourself a shot
and then pour one for my man Magic.

09:25.998 --> 09:27.363
Let me ask you something, Nick.

09:27.533 --> 09:29.592
If you don't have him,
why'd you sell the shop?

09:30.069 --> 09:31.331
I need the money, Jimmy.

09:31.671 --> 09:34.799
It's been cool, but it's kind of hard
having Suzanne and the kids...

09:34.974 --> 09:37.238
...just crammed up
into my small place.

09:37.476 --> 09:39.467
It's just time to move on up, man.

09:39.712 --> 09:42.078
PIus, I didn't tell you,
I'm having a baby.

09:42.248 --> 09:44.113
AII right. My man's having a baby.

09:44.283 --> 09:46.808
-Yeah. Yeah. That's right.
-Hey, baby.

09:46.986 --> 09:49.454
-Hey, hey, hey.
-I thought I'd find you here. Hi, Jimmy.

09:49.622 --> 09:52.785
-How'd it go?
-It went great.

09:52.959 --> 09:54.586
Check it out.

09:56.495 --> 09:57.860
Hey.

09:59.966 --> 10:02.025
This baby got two heads.

10:02.201 --> 10:06.433
And four arms and four Iegs.
Nick, we're having twins.

10:08.941 --> 10:10.636
Twins?

10:14.080 --> 10:16.310
-Honey.
-Cut off, Nick.

10:16.482 --> 10:18.313
Thanks, Jimmy.

10:25.558 --> 10:27.958
I can't believe you're making us
move to the country.

10:28.127 --> 10:30.721
This is like child abuse
of the worst kind.

10:31.931 --> 10:34.058
Where's the mall?

10:34.233 --> 10:36.428
What you need a mall for?
That's your problem now.

10:36.602 --> 10:39.435
You need to get a Iittle fresh air
and open spaces. Try that.

10:39.639 --> 10:43.234
Lindsey, please. Okay?
Everybody, just relax.

10:43.409 --> 10:45.400
Yeah, just relax.

10:45.911 --> 10:47.538
Here, sweetie. Have a juice.

10:49.515 --> 10:52.643
-Oh, God--
-Kevin!

10:55.521 --> 10:56.886
What's that smell?

10:58.224 --> 10:59.885
Smells Iike oxygen.

11:00.059 --> 11:02.357
Mom, please tell me you're joking.

11:02.528 --> 11:04.689
-Enough.
-I hope it's the right place.

11:04.864 --> 11:08.265
Of course it's not.
Our old house is the right house.

11:08.434 --> 11:10.459
This is the place, guys. Come on.

11:10.670 --> 11:14.071
Let's have a positive
mental attitude, okay?

11:22.581 --> 11:24.071
Nice floors.

11:24.250 --> 11:25.945
I smell cookies.

11:26.118 --> 11:31.021
Kevin, Kevin, you cannot just walk
around these people's house Iike that.

11:35.428 --> 11:37.123
Oh, this the culprit right here.

11:38.631 --> 11:39.655
God!

11:39.832 --> 11:44.860
Oh, baby. Oh, honey.
Okay, cold water. Go. Cold water.

11:47.473 --> 11:49.941
Oh, goodness gracious!
What happened in here?

11:50.109 --> 11:52.703
Did you touch the stove?
Was it the stove?

11:52.878 --> 11:55.438
I'II tell you what, gonna put
Tunisian hemp root on there.

11:55.614 --> 11:56.706
Make it as good as new.

11:57.717 --> 12:00.481
It's true, actually.
I'm so sorry about that.

12:00.653 --> 12:03.986
It's fine. He's just being a big baby.

12:04.657 --> 12:06.318
Name's Chuck Mitchell Jr.

12:06.492 --> 12:10.189
I'm the Iocal real-estate guy
here in Newburg County and....

12:10.362 --> 12:12.387
You....

12:12.565 --> 12:15.159
I know just exactly who you are.

12:15.468 --> 12:16.833
You're Nick.

12:17.703 --> 12:19.762
There we go.

12:19.939 --> 12:22.339
Note to self, the hand still hurts.

12:24.243 --> 12:27.178
-And the radiant....
-Suzanne.

12:28.247 --> 12:29.908
Oh, my G-O-D.

12:30.850 --> 12:32.818
Suzanne's with child.

12:35.821 --> 12:38.881
You old dog, you!

12:39.058 --> 12:41.492
-Oh, well--
-Hold up.

12:41.660 --> 12:44.288
It's okay. I'm a part-time midwife.

12:44.463 --> 12:45.794
I actually studied...

12:45.965 --> 12:48.991
...at the Natural Childbirth Center
in Lucerne, Switzerland.

12:50.803 --> 12:53.203
They're twins, aren't they?

12:53.372 --> 12:57.206
Yes, they are.
How did you know that?

12:58.811 --> 13:01.746
Would you Iike to know the sexes?

13:03.649 --> 13:04.946
No.

13:05.117 --> 13:08.644
Matter of fact, we wanna
keep it a surprise, Chuck.

13:08.821 --> 13:11.415
Oh, fair enough. Isn't that
every parent's prerogative?

13:11.590 --> 13:18.189
But if I were you, I wouldn't be in any
big hurry to paint the nursery pink.

13:18.731 --> 13:22.861
Oh, gosh. It's just a special time,
being in that delivery room.

13:23.135 --> 13:26.070
Right. The man almost fainted
when our guppy had babies.

13:26.238 --> 13:29.332
Now, you know that
that was a hard delivery for me.

13:29.508 --> 13:33.968
AII that cloudy water and then those
Iittle things popping out one by one.

13:36.015 --> 13:37.573
Honey?

13:37.750 --> 13:39.217
Babe.

13:39.385 --> 13:41.114
Honey.

13:43.055 --> 13:48.459
Now, the place was built in 1 889
by H. Van Hackett himself...

13:48.627 --> 13:50.652
...Iegendary architect
and perfectionist.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.821
I'd Iike to tell you something
right up front:

13:52.998 --> 13:57.526
In all my years in "the business"--
And there have been more than a few.

13:57.870 --> 14:01.067
--I have never seen
a more sound home.

14:01.674 --> 14:03.164
Structurally speaking.

14:04.009 --> 14:06.273
Wait till you get a Ioad
of the second floor.

14:06.445 --> 14:07.810
Baby, do you see this?

14:07.980 --> 14:09.914
-It's okay, we'II fix it.
-Did you see this?

14:10.115 --> 14:14.415
Now, she's got five bedrooms
and four bathrooms...

14:14.587 --> 14:18.455
...so needless to say, there's plenty
of room for the whole fam.

14:18.624 --> 14:23.823
I think we're gonna go ahead and put
Mom and Dad in the master bedroom.

14:23.996 --> 14:26.260
-Five bedrooms, right?
-Five, baby. You feeling me?

14:26.432 --> 14:27.421
I'm feeling you.

14:28.267 --> 14:30.394
-This big enough for you, baby?
-It's beautiful.

14:30.569 --> 14:33.868
And, of course, the master bathroom.

14:35.040 --> 14:37.600
Oh, my God, baby, a claw-foot tub.

14:37.776 --> 14:40.438
-I've always wanted one of these.
-Me too.

14:40.613 --> 14:42.080
Pretty awesome, right?

14:42.248 --> 14:46.844
-I Iike it.
-It's beautiful. And the double sinks!

14:48.387 --> 14:51.550
Oh, my God.
Baby, Iook at the shower.

14:52.358 --> 14:55.725
Oh, my God, honey, this is bigger
than our entire apartment.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.760
I know.

14:58.864 --> 15:00.161
What's in there, Chuck?

15:00.332 --> 15:03.631
That is a private toilet.

15:08.440 --> 15:09.907
Baby.

15:10.075 --> 15:12.475
-Did you say private?
-Yes, sir.

15:12.645 --> 15:15.113
Oh, my God.

15:16.081 --> 15:17.412
How I Iook?

15:17.616 --> 15:19.083
How do you feel?

15:19.251 --> 15:20.343
I feel good.

15:20.519 --> 15:22.510
Feeling good's good enough.

15:27.860 --> 15:29.293
You be okay in there, Nick?

15:30.429 --> 15:32.556
Just give me one minute.

15:39.038 --> 15:42.974
So, now, Suzanne here tells me
that you're in the publishing game?

15:43.142 --> 15:46.134
Oh, yeah, I did sell a magazine
to OmniHouse.

15:46.312 --> 15:47.301
An entrepreneur.

15:47.479 --> 15:50.710
A budding William Randolph Hearst
right here in our midst.

15:50.883 --> 15:54.114
I don't really know who that is,
Chuck, but, hey, I guess so.

15:54.286 --> 15:56.186
Modest too? They broke the mold.

15:56.355 --> 15:58.721
I'II tell you what, Suze,
I'd hang on to this one.

15:58.891 --> 16:01.519
Oh, yeah, he's a keeper, Chuck.

16:03.295 --> 16:05.525
Oh, way to stick the Ianding, Kev-o.

16:12.538 --> 16:15.701
The Hacketts, of course,
used this as a guest cottage.

16:15.874 --> 16:19.105
But with just a "scootcharino" of work,
it could be easily converted...

16:19.278 --> 16:22.304
...into the perfect creative nook for,
you know, a....

16:23.315 --> 16:25.306
A publisher.

16:25.484 --> 16:29.079
You know, I was thinking about
writing in that bathroom up there.

16:29.254 --> 16:30.243
Oh, yeah?

16:31.490 --> 16:34.516
-Oh, honey, this is so charming.
-This'II work too.

16:34.827 --> 16:37.853
Just for a second, Nick,
just for a second, imagine....

16:38.030 --> 16:40.362
Imagine watching
a blue-throated hummingbird...

16:40.532 --> 16:43.695
...suckle the nectar from a fresh
hydrangea blossom...

16:43.869 --> 16:46.337
...while you free your mind...

16:46.505 --> 16:50.134
...to the creative impulses that have
made every publishing empire great.

16:50.309 --> 16:53.574
This is not a dress rehearsal, Nick.

16:53.746 --> 16:58.046
Live the dream, baby,
Iive the dream.

16:59.818 --> 17:02.446
Would you guys Iike
to see a tremendous view?

17:02.621 --> 17:04.417
Would you? Come on. Come on.

17:04.589 --> 17:07.888
-It's the coup de grâce. You'II Iove it.
-Come on, baby.

17:08.493 --> 17:11.190
You're gonna wanna get Iow
coming through this door.

17:11.363 --> 17:14.355
The roof-- Think you'II find the roof
needs a Iittle bit of work...

17:14.532 --> 17:17.229
...so please be careful.

17:22.174 --> 17:24.404
The property includes
an apple orchard.

17:24.576 --> 17:28.410
There's some wild blackberries
over here, some cedars.

17:28.614 --> 17:32.243
And I don't even wanna tell you
about the view of the Iake from here.

17:32.418 --> 17:33.407
Breathe.

17:33.585 --> 17:38.784
Breathe, breathe in that rich,
fresh air, Mr. Publisher.

17:38.957 --> 17:40.822
How about it?

17:40.993 --> 17:45.089
Oh, not so incidentally, they just built
a brand-new school down the road.

17:45.264 --> 17:46.288
Really?

17:46.465 --> 17:49.628
Newburg is a really amazing place
to raise a family.

17:49.802 --> 17:51.929
Oh, it's just so beautiful, Chuck.

17:52.104 --> 17:55.301
Well, you should see it
in the middle of the winter...

17:55.474 --> 17:58.466
...with a blanket of snow covering it.
It's pretty as a postcard.

17:58.744 --> 18:01.679
Personally, I Iike to power-walk
through these woods.

18:01.980 --> 18:06.474
Never mind the fact that, of course,
I used to do the walk competitively.

18:06.652 --> 18:07.846
Really?

18:08.020 --> 18:12.457
Yeah, I was an alternate
to the '94 Goodwill Games in Russia.

18:16.695 --> 18:19.687
Like I say, she is a fixer-upper...

18:19.865 --> 18:22.993
...but I happen to know the finest
contractor in these parts.

18:23.168 --> 18:25.693
You give that gentleman
a call and....

18:25.871 --> 18:28.066
One way to make your Iife
a whole Iot easier.

18:28.373 --> 18:30.273
So, now, where do
we stand there, Nickster?

18:31.677 --> 18:32.905
I don't know, Chuck.

18:33.078 --> 18:36.673
I'm not really sure if this is
the right place for us, you know.

18:36.849 --> 18:39.545
It's a Iittle high-priced
and you're a Iittle weird.

18:40.886 --> 18:44.947
Oh, gosh, I actually scheduled
a couple back-to-back with you guys.

18:45.124 --> 18:49.686
Larry, Bernice. Hello! Come in.
PIease, make yourself at home.

18:50.028 --> 18:52.292
-Okay, Chuck. Thanks.
-Thank you.

18:52.464 --> 18:53.658
I gotta go.

18:58.637 --> 18:59.626
So, what you think?

18:59.805 --> 19:03.297
I don't know. I don't know.
Can we really afford this house?

19:03.509 --> 19:04.498
Of course.

19:04.676 --> 19:07.543
Baby, with the advance,
plus the money we saved on rent...

19:07.713 --> 19:10.147
...we can buy this place
two times over.

19:10.315 --> 19:12.146
And have money to fix it up.

19:12.351 --> 19:13.818
And guess what.

19:13.986 --> 19:15.419
I can do the fixing.

19:15.587 --> 19:18.647
I can barely get you to change
a Iight bulb at the apartment.

19:18.824 --> 19:21.725
So what? Look, Iook.
Take a Iook at this.

19:21.894 --> 19:23.486
-A house is Iike a painting.
-Yeah.

19:23.662 --> 19:27.120
You can't really buy with your head,
you gotta buy with your heart.

19:27.499 --> 19:30.332
Yeah, honey, but we have to think
with our heads right now.

19:30.502 --> 19:31.867
We gotta think about the kids.

19:32.037 --> 19:34.938
We gotta think about
it's the middle of the school year...

19:35.107 --> 19:40.443
...Lindsey has her friends and she just
met that nice boy in her math class.

19:40.746 --> 19:43.214
There's plenty of stuff
around here for Lindsey to do...

19:43.382 --> 19:45.077
...that have nothing to do with boys.

19:45.250 --> 19:46.717
And Kevin, this is perfect!

19:47.019 --> 19:49.078
Look at the nature.
Look at the wilderness.

19:49.254 --> 19:51.188
We got a blueberry tree, baby.

19:51.356 --> 19:54.848
Are we talking about the same kid?
Kevin doesn't go outside for recess.

19:55.027 --> 19:58.758
That's why he needs a place Iike this,
to toughen him up.

19:58.931 --> 20:00.831
PIus, I can take him fishing.

20:01.133 --> 20:02.395
Who's going fishing?

20:02.568 --> 20:04.502
-Me.
-You fish?

20:04.670 --> 20:05.967
Oh, I can fish, baby.

20:06.138 --> 20:08.106
Oh, when's the Iast time
you went fishing?

20:09.374 --> 20:11.774
Last time-- Matter of fact,
it was before I met you...

20:11.944 --> 20:13.241
...Iast time I went fishing.

20:13.412 --> 20:14.572
And....

20:14.846 --> 20:17.076
I don't know how to fish,
but I can Iearn.

20:17.616 --> 20:19.709
And then I could teach him,
and we can bond.

20:19.885 --> 20:21.853
-"We can bond."
-We'II become a true family.

20:22.020 --> 20:24.488
-"A true family."
-Picture it.

20:24.856 --> 20:26.653
What you think?

20:27.926 --> 20:32.590
I think there are a Iot
of rooms in this house...

20:33.365 --> 20:35.959
...that are gonna need breaking in.

20:36.134 --> 20:39.297
Oh, yeah?
Well, what about the roof?

20:39.471 --> 20:42.304
The roof isn't a bad place to start.

20:42.474 --> 20:45.307
Well, come over here,
drop it Iike it's hot, girl.

20:45.811 --> 20:47.301
Baby!

20:52.551 --> 20:53.916
We'II take it.

21:10.869 --> 21:12.131
Good boy.

21:12.738 --> 21:14.865
Good boy.

21:17.309 --> 21:20.676
-Where'd she go?
-She was just.... I don't know.

21:21.813 --> 21:23.576
There.

21:25.517 --> 21:27.417
What you doing?

22:44.262 --> 22:47.163
Stop! Coco, stop!

22:48.767 --> 22:51.361
Help!

23:05.350 --> 23:07.978
Hey, honey, do you know
how this garbage disposal works?

23:08.153 --> 23:11.782
Because I've tried every single one
of these switches.

23:11.990 --> 23:13.218
What about this one?

23:14.760 --> 23:18.958
See? Everything is working out
just Iike I promised, huh?

23:23.101 --> 23:24.261
I can fix that.

23:24.536 --> 23:26.629
Oh, you can fix that?

23:28.573 --> 23:32.009
Hey, I hope we're not disturbing you.
I'm Mr. Rooney, this is Mrs. Rooney.

23:32.177 --> 23:35.374
Oh, so formal.
PIease, call me Mrs. Rooney.

23:35.747 --> 23:37.738
We wanted to be the first
to welcome you.

23:37.916 --> 23:39.577
Oh, we sure did.

23:39.751 --> 23:41.582
We are the first, aren't we?

23:42.053 --> 23:43.042
You're the first.

23:43.455 --> 23:44.479
Yes.

23:45.157 --> 23:46.954
-That Iooks gross.
-Kevin.

23:47.125 --> 23:49.423
That fish put this town on the map.

23:49.594 --> 23:53.394
Oh, yeah. Sturgeon tastes
a Iot Iike chicken, only fishy.

23:53.598 --> 23:55.361
-Nice.
-I think you're gonna enjoy it.

23:55.534 --> 23:57.434
And even if you don't, it's dead.

23:58.136 --> 24:00.263
Did you wanna come inside
for something to drink?

24:00.639 --> 24:02.539
Oh, that's so sweet.

24:02.707 --> 24:05.870
But we don't really drink so early
in the day around these parts, but--

24:06.044 --> 24:11.539
-Right. No.
-No, no, I meant, Iike, just a Iemonade.

24:18.924 --> 24:20.949
Boy, get them fish.

24:22.494 --> 24:24.052
Thank you. CIose the door.

24:24.563 --> 24:26.690
-Welcome.
-For you.

24:26.865 --> 24:28.992
Tastes Iike chicken.

24:32.337 --> 24:35.773
Sturgeon, right?
Give me the fish, man.

24:35.941 --> 24:38.569
Y'all get out of here
before I call the cops.

24:41.613 --> 24:45.014
Hey, Nick.
I can't find Coco anywhere.

24:45.183 --> 24:46.445
Give me that.

24:46.651 --> 24:49.051
Don't worry about Coco,
he'II show up sooner or Iater.

24:49.221 --> 24:51.815
There's a Iot of trees
to pee on out there.

24:55.227 --> 24:56.694
What you want me to do?

24:58.697 --> 25:00.722
Coco!

25:01.867 --> 25:03.960
Where's that dog?

25:04.135 --> 25:07.730
Maybe we should go back.
It's kind of scary out here.

25:07.906 --> 25:09.965
Scary? Boy, it's beautiful out here.

25:10.141 --> 25:13.508
Look, you with the man. I was the man
in the city, and I'm the man out here.

25:13.678 --> 25:16.704
Trust me, when you're with me,
there's nothing to be scared of.

25:19.417 --> 25:20.679
But that.

25:22.454 --> 25:26.083
Run! Go! Go!

25:27.158 --> 25:28.523
Can you hear me now?

25:28.727 --> 25:31.355
Hello? Can you hear me now?

25:31.530 --> 25:34.499
Off the phone, please. Here we are.

25:34.966 --> 25:37.059
Oh, Iook at this.

25:37.836 --> 25:39.770
-That's nice.
-Yeah.

25:39.938 --> 25:42.429
And Iook at us.
One big, happy family.

25:42.607 --> 25:45.075
Yes, one big, happy family.

25:45.644 --> 25:47.771
Lindsey, would you Iike
to give thanks?

25:48.346 --> 25:49.813
Why, are we going home?

25:49.981 --> 25:51.710
This is our home.

25:51.917 --> 25:52.906
Our real home, Mom.

25:53.084 --> 25:56.281
Where my friends are.
Where I can get cell phone reception.

25:56.454 --> 25:58.820
Lindsey,
put away the phone, please.

25:59.558 --> 26:00.786
Kevin?

26:01.059 --> 26:03.357
-I don't Iike this fish.
-Me neither.

26:03.662 --> 26:06.859
But we're gonna be eating this
every day for the next six months...

26:07.065 --> 26:08.498
...so get used to it.

26:09.134 --> 26:11.898
Now, Lindsey. Grace.

26:12.070 --> 26:15.801
Dear Lord, thank you for all the
blessings that you gave us.

26:16.308 --> 26:18.173
Before they were taken away.

26:19.044 --> 26:21.808
Like my friends,
cell phone reception--

26:21.980 --> 26:23.242
Time-out, I got this.

26:23.448 --> 26:24.915
PIease, honey.

26:25.083 --> 26:27.984
Oh, patient and heavenly Father...

26:28.253 --> 26:31.814
...who's probably 1 0 times
more patient and heavenly...

26:31.990 --> 26:34.220
...than any stepfather
should have to be--

26:34.426 --> 26:35.415
Baby.

26:35.594 --> 26:36.891
--we give thanks.

26:37.629 --> 26:39.062
I know at times it seems Iike...

26:39.230 --> 26:41.960
...we're nothing but a bunch of
back-talking sass mouths...

26:42.133 --> 26:45.864
...who don't know when we got it good
in a nice, beautiful home.

26:50.742 --> 26:52.266
At Ieast the table's strong.

26:56.615 --> 26:58.606
I can fix that.

26:59.517 --> 27:01.781
Honey, I think you should
just call the contractor.

27:01.953 --> 27:06.049
Suzanne, the electrical parts
alone is a 30 percent markup.

27:06.224 --> 27:08.158
And a contractor?

27:08.326 --> 27:10.794
You're talking about
1 25 bucks a hour.

27:19.804 --> 27:22.295
Now do you want the number?

27:28.313 --> 27:30.873
Contractor's here!

27:36.588 --> 27:38.886
Coco! Oh, Coco.

27:39.257 --> 27:40.815
Coco, sit.

27:51.603 --> 27:53.002
How did you do that?

27:53.171 --> 27:55.571
That's German.
It's the Ianguage of discipline.

27:55.774 --> 27:58.436
I was fortunate a couple of years back
to spend some time...

27:58.610 --> 28:01.101
...and study with the friars
of New Skete.

28:01.279 --> 28:02.940
Nick!

28:03.114 --> 28:05.378
I found Coco by the highway,
but it's no problem...

28:05.550 --> 28:09.042
-...because he had his tags on.
-Chuck, what you doing here?

28:09.220 --> 28:12.883
I got a message down at the office
that you were Iooking for a contractor?

28:13.892 --> 28:15.860
But you're the Iocal real-estate guy.

28:16.061 --> 28:17.961
Yes, I am.

28:18.163 --> 28:20.495
And I'm also the Iocal contractor.

28:20.665 --> 28:21.962
Do you Iove it?

28:27.272 --> 28:30.207
-What's that smell?
-Fifty pounds of fish.

28:30.375 --> 28:32.343
Do you know the power
went out Iast night?

28:32.510 --> 28:33.875
On it.

28:36.748 --> 28:37.840
What you mean, "ruh-roh"?

28:38.016 --> 28:42.009
Nick, when exactly
did you buy this home?

28:42.220 --> 28:43.653
Are you serious?

28:43.822 --> 28:45.687
You know exactly
when I bought this dump...

28:45.857 --> 28:47.552
...because you the one sold it to us.

28:47.726 --> 28:50.058
And that's what makes it
so very unpleasant for me...

28:50.228 --> 28:53.254
...to have to tell you that your home's
electrical system is shot.

28:53.732 --> 28:56.394
AII right, all right, all right.
FIag on the play.

28:56.568 --> 28:59.298
Why didn't you tell us this
when you showed us the house?

29:00.004 --> 29:03.701
Nick, in all fairness,
I did have my Realtor's cap on.

29:03.875 --> 29:07.106
You know, might remember
that great blue blazer and the khakis.

29:07.312 --> 29:09.644
My contractor's hat was safely
at home in the closet.

29:09.814 --> 29:11.941
They're two distinctly
different chapeaus...

29:12.150 --> 29:15.347
...but they should have told you
when you had the place inspected.

29:15.754 --> 29:17.051
How's it going, guys?

29:17.222 --> 29:19.190
Nick didn't have
this dump inspected.

29:19.357 --> 29:22.349
I had it inspected. It was inspected.

29:27.499 --> 29:29.194
It was just inspected by me.

29:29.367 --> 29:31.426
Honey, how could you not
hire an inspector?

29:31.603 --> 29:34.128
We talked about this.
How could you be so irresponsible?

29:34.305 --> 29:35.932
I trusted you on this.

29:36.141 --> 29:39.372
-Don't blame me, it's his fault.
-Well, how is it Chuck's fault?

29:39.544 --> 29:40.533
He Iied!

29:40.712 --> 29:43.772
No, he didn't. You was just too cheap
to hire an inspector.

29:43.948 --> 29:45.279
That's besides the point.

29:47.051 --> 29:48.643
They're kicking, aren't they?

29:48.853 --> 29:50.582
Feels Iike they're playing soccer.

29:50.755 --> 29:52.245
You okay?

29:54.159 --> 29:58.528
They say that the move
was very traumatic for them...

29:58.730 --> 30:01.392
...and that you shouldn't sleep
on your right side.

30:01.566 --> 30:02.965
How do you know, Chuck?

30:03.601 --> 30:05.034
I'm a baby whisperer.

30:05.203 --> 30:06.534
A baby what?

30:08.439 --> 30:12.842
AIso, they'd Iove it if you could Iay off
the Indian food. Curry is a no-no.

30:13.011 --> 30:14.706
Oh, brother.

30:14.879 --> 30:18.144
Unfortunately, you gotta upgrade
the main panel and pull all the wires.

30:18.316 --> 30:19.840
That just sound Iike a bigger job.

30:20.018 --> 30:21.713
Oh, crap.

30:25.757 --> 30:27.691
You got raccoons.

30:28.393 --> 30:31.829
Oh, yeah. Raccoons
that Iike Corn Nuts.

30:32.163 --> 30:36.600
Word to the wise, careful with those
raccoons. They're vicious.

30:36.968 --> 30:37.992
Hey, hey, Chuck.

30:38.536 --> 30:40.504
When it comes
to this electrical stuff....

30:42.273 --> 30:43.706
How much this gonna cost me?

30:43.875 --> 30:45.740
Oh, gosh, I don't know.
A home this size...

30:45.910 --> 30:47.878
...you're Iooking at 8, 9.

30:48.046 --> 30:49.877
-Hundred?
-Thousand.

30:50.448 --> 30:51.881
Get off my property.

30:55.019 --> 30:56.213
I might fixed.

30:56.387 --> 30:58.252
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

30:59.891 --> 31:01.791
Perfect.
That's what I'm talking about.

31:01.960 --> 31:03.222
I'm professional.

31:03.394 --> 31:05.487
Thanks. Appreciate it, Serge.

31:05.663 --> 31:07.392
Come again.

31:10.435 --> 31:15.395
Did you see that? Look and Iearn,
Iittle girl. 1 50 bucks. Painless.

31:15.573 --> 31:17.302
Are you sure it's safe?

31:17.475 --> 31:19.272
Of course it's safe.

31:19.444 --> 31:20.706
He said all we gotta do...

31:20.879 --> 31:24.246
...is not use the microwave
and the toaster at the same time.

31:25.917 --> 31:28.044
That's just common sense.

31:31.990 --> 31:33.423
Eight thousand dollars.

31:33.591 --> 31:36.151
I knew that dude Chuck
was a crook the minute I met him.

31:36.327 --> 31:38.727
Oh, honey, I think
you're a Iittle bit stressed out...

31:38.897 --> 31:42.162
...with the move and everything and,
you know...

31:42.333 --> 31:45.200
...there's one thing
that we haven't been able to do...

31:45.370 --> 31:46.997
...in this big old drafty mansion.

31:47.538 --> 31:49.665
Insulation. That'II be perfect.

31:49.841 --> 31:53.038
If we do that, we'II save
a Iot of money on heating bills.

31:53.211 --> 31:56.544
Baby, I was actually thinking of
something else we could do...

31:56.714 --> 31:59.046
...to stay nice and warm.

31:59.384 --> 32:01.545
Oh, I know what you're thinking.

32:04.188 --> 32:05.519
Honey, what was that?

32:05.690 --> 32:07.123
The raccoon.

32:07.292 --> 32:08.953
-He's on the roof?
-Yeah.

32:09.127 --> 32:10.822
You gotta show him who's boss.

32:10.995 --> 32:13.793
If you don't do that,
you'II never get rid of him.

32:15.033 --> 32:16.864
Baby, but Chuck says they're vicious.

32:17.035 --> 32:18.593
Yeah, if you're a baby whisperer.

32:19.537 --> 32:22.802
But me, I'm the man.

32:23.274 --> 32:25.435
You are the man.

32:25.610 --> 32:27.874
-You got my back?
-I got your back.

32:28.046 --> 32:29.479
Watch this.

32:43.361 --> 32:45.158
Is that my Corn Nuts?

32:46.397 --> 32:48.592
You should know
not to mess with a man's nuts.

32:48.766 --> 32:50.893
Be prepared
to pay the ultimate price.

32:51.069 --> 32:53.401
Honey. Honey, what are you
doing out there?

32:53.571 --> 32:54.799
Step back, baby.

32:55.773 --> 32:56.762
What you wanna do?

32:57.775 --> 32:59.174
Look, he ain't even running.

32:59.577 --> 33:01.704
He think he bad. You think you bad?

33:03.247 --> 33:06.341
I've dealt with rats in the city
bigger than you, boy.

33:08.052 --> 33:10.919
Kids, go to bed. I got this.

33:12.790 --> 33:15.088
-Baby!
-I got him!

33:21.966 --> 33:23.058
Did I get him?

33:25.370 --> 33:26.735
-No.
-No.

33:29.073 --> 33:30.836
Sucker.

33:54.999 --> 33:56.899
Nicholas J. Persons?

33:57.335 --> 34:01.066
-Chuck?
-Charles Mitchell. City inspector.

34:02.507 --> 34:04.600
We got a problem. Let's go.

34:05.443 --> 34:07.240
What's with the badge, Chuck?

34:07.412 --> 34:11.041
Look, I don't have time for
none of this, okay? So make it quick.

34:11.215 --> 34:15.275
Sir, you can't just go around tapping
into other people's power supplies.

34:15.453 --> 34:17.444
It's dangerous, it's against the Iaw...

34:17.621 --> 34:20.455
...and quite frankly, Mr. Persons,
it's rude.

34:20.992 --> 34:22.583
What are you talking about?

34:22.760 --> 34:24.125
I'm gonna go ahead and guess...

34:24.295 --> 34:27.264
...that that work wasn't done
by a Iicensed contractor.

34:27.431 --> 34:30.230
You know, I didn't even know
they was gonna Ieave it Iike that.

34:30.400 --> 34:33.632
You went ahead and availed yourself
to the cheap, unskilled Iabor pool...

34:33.804 --> 34:35.931
...that congregates outside
the hardware store?

34:37.074 --> 34:40.237
I know. Tell you what I'm gonna do.

34:40.411 --> 34:42.675
For reference, I'm gonna
provide you with a Iist...

34:42.847 --> 34:45.007
...of all the Iicensed,
bonded contractors...

34:45.183 --> 34:47.844
...we have here in the Iocal vicinity.

34:49.754 --> 34:54.190
I am also going to fine you $1 000
for breaking the Iaw.

34:54.358 --> 34:56.451
What? A thousand bucks?

34:56.627 --> 34:58.151
If you knew what you were doing...

34:58.329 --> 35:01.526
...you'd be facing jail time,
so consider yourself Iucky.

35:03.101 --> 35:05.797
We're shutting your power down
till further notice.

35:06.204 --> 35:09.469
What am I supposed to do?
Build a windmill?

35:09.640 --> 35:13.303
Well, that's not a bad idea, so Iong as
you contact the city zoning officer first.

35:13.478 --> 35:15.469
Quality guy.
Would you Iike his card?

35:15.646 --> 35:16.806
-No.
-I'm out of here.

35:16.981 --> 35:20.439
Hey, wait a minute, Chuck.
Chuck, come on, man. It's me. Nick.

35:22.253 --> 35:23.811
Help me get my power back on.

35:23.988 --> 35:25.956
I'm the city inspector, Mr. Persons.

35:26.124 --> 35:28.217
Restoring power's
a Iittle beyond my purview.

35:28.860 --> 35:33.888
Okay, I know what this is. And I seen
this one before. What's it gonna take?

35:34.065 --> 35:37.796
You realize if I accepted that,
I'd have to arrest myself on the spot...

35:37.969 --> 35:39.334
...and I'm not that guy.

35:40.037 --> 35:41.368
But you're a contractor.

35:41.539 --> 35:44.201
But I'm not wearing
that hat right now.

35:46.844 --> 35:48.471
Well, you can put it on.

35:51.482 --> 35:54.474
It's your Iucky day.
It happens to be in the car.

35:58.489 --> 36:02.482
Oh, God. Oh, what,
they shut you down?

36:02.660 --> 36:06.221
The heartless bureaucrats.
They're the worst.

36:07.231 --> 36:08.755
Can you help me?

36:08.933 --> 36:11.834
Well, restoring power's
not as easy as it sounds.

36:12.003 --> 36:13.766
It just might take a couple days.

36:13.938 --> 36:17.374
A couple of days?
Man, I'm trying to Iaunch a magazine.

36:17.542 --> 36:20.170
AII right? What am I supposed to do
without a computer?

36:20.645 --> 36:22.169
We're gonna get your power
back on.

36:22.547 --> 36:24.481
It's not even gonna be an issue.

36:24.649 --> 36:26.173
Trust me.

36:33.090 --> 36:34.387
Here you go, honey.

36:35.593 --> 36:37.060
Your sandwich.

36:39.030 --> 36:40.588
-What?
-Okay.

36:42.166 --> 36:44.066
-Hey, Suzanne.
-Hey, Chuck. Come on in.

36:44.235 --> 36:45.930
What smells good?
Are those sandwiches?

36:46.103 --> 36:48.230
Oh, yeah, sturgeon salad.
Would you Iike one?

36:48.406 --> 36:51.432
-I hate to impose.
-Oh, no, Chuck, anything for you.

36:51.609 --> 36:54.578
Hey, hey, hey, man. What's with
all the racket? I'm trying to work.

36:54.745 --> 36:57.771
We had to saw off the breaker box.
I'd Iike some mustard on there.

36:57.949 --> 36:59.109
I'm a big mustard guy.

36:59.283 --> 37:02.650
But you should be good now.
We'II have you up and running in a jiff.

37:02.820 --> 37:08.417
That's Magic Johnson. That's my guy.
That's my main man.

37:08.593 --> 37:10.891
Did I tell you
I was on the '86 Lakers?

37:11.062 --> 37:13.326
-No.
-Yes, indeedy, sweetie.

37:13.664 --> 37:16.258
I had 38 seconds of playing time.

37:16.434 --> 37:18.766
It was game two of the final
and "Big Game" James...

37:18.936 --> 37:22.838
...went down with a bad wheel,
so we're up by 20 and they put me in.

37:23.007 --> 37:24.440
Check it out, Nicker.

37:24.609 --> 37:26.702
Get ahold of the purple and gold.

37:29.513 --> 37:31.242
That's commitment, right?

37:31.415 --> 37:34.851
When you do talk to the Magic Man,
tell him Chuck-dog said:

37:35.019 --> 37:37.078
"Holler. That's what's up."

37:37.989 --> 37:39.923
-"Holler."
-Thank you so much.

37:40.091 --> 37:43.925
Anyway, the good news is we're
getting the power up and running.

37:47.331 --> 37:50.164
The bad news is you got dry rot.

37:50.334 --> 37:52.131
Dry what?

37:52.303 --> 37:55.136
Can I tell you something?
This is the most incredible sandwich.

37:55.306 --> 37:57.331
You know your way
around a sturgeon.

37:57.508 --> 38:00.272
Wait, wait, wait a minute.
Back to the dry rot.

38:00.444 --> 38:01.433
How big is this?

38:01.612 --> 38:05.139
Well, it could be considerable,
but y'all don't worry about a thing.

38:05.316 --> 38:07.682
I know the best dry-rot guys
in Newburg County.

38:09.253 --> 38:10.880
How's the guy situation out there?

38:11.289 --> 38:13.883
Nothing at all.
No cuties, no nothing.

38:14.058 --> 38:17.027
Girl, I feel sorry for you.

38:22.400 --> 38:24.459
-I didn't wanna move here.
-I don't blame you.

38:26.470 --> 38:28.461
Push. Push.

38:36.881 --> 38:38.678
You should try
and get back here somehow.

38:38.849 --> 38:40.680
At least there are boys here.

38:40.851 --> 38:43.684
Are you still there? Linds? Hello?

38:43.854 --> 38:46.550
Hello? Are you there?

38:46.724 --> 38:49.124
Yeah. I gotta go.

38:54.231 --> 38:56.893
Yup. You got the rot, brah.

39:00.071 --> 39:02.665
-How you know?
-Nick.

39:02.840 --> 39:04.034
-What?
-He's not aware.

39:04.208 --> 39:09.111
Nick, the Pulu family has been in the
dry-rot business for three generations.

39:09.280 --> 39:11.805
Hawaiians know the dry rot
better than the rest of us...

39:11.982 --> 39:13.847
...because the island is so darn wet.

39:14.018 --> 39:16.509
Well, then why do they call it dry rot?

39:16.687 --> 39:19.121
That's a misnomer. Listen carefully.

39:19.290 --> 39:22.851
Billy and George here,
they're highly skilled craftsmen...

39:23.027 --> 39:27.589
...very much in demand,
but Danny, gosh, he's got a gift.

39:27.765 --> 39:33.567
He's an artist, and if he says you've
got the rot, you've got the rot, brah.

39:33.738 --> 39:39.973
Okay, say I got "the rot," brah.
I mean, can't we Iive with it?

39:40.144 --> 39:43.272
Can you Iive with a wood-rotting
fungi that colonizes and spreads...

39:43.447 --> 39:46.075
...to every timber in your home,
Ieading to a mold...

39:46.250 --> 39:48.377
...which can produce
airborne pathogens...

39:48.552 --> 39:50.816
...that might infect every member
of your family...

39:50.988 --> 39:53.786
...causing conjunctivitis,
hypersensitivity pneumonitis...

39:53.958 --> 39:55.789
...and I'm not gonna Iie to you here...

39:55.960 --> 39:58.861
...allergic bronchopulmonary
aspergillosis.

39:59.363 --> 40:00.887
Oh, yeah. No problem.

40:01.065 --> 40:02.828
No.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.991
I think they should fix it now.

40:05.803 --> 40:09.466
You know, that is, because we don't
want it to spread and kill us all, right?

40:09.640 --> 40:11.801
Don't you got clothes
to go put on or something?

40:11.976 --> 40:13.568
-Ma.
-Go.

40:18.282 --> 40:19.306
Right here, right here.

40:19.950 --> 40:21.713
AII right, how much
is it gonna cost me?

40:22.186 --> 40:24.086
-Tough to predict.
-It's Iike that.

40:25.423 --> 40:28.586
Do what you gotta do, all right?
Do what you gotta do.

40:28.759 --> 40:30.192
But you gotta put on these...

40:30.361 --> 40:33.797
...because you're kind of fat and
I don't want you scuffing up my floors.

40:33.964 --> 40:35.363
Don't be a hick, Nick.

40:35.833 --> 40:37.824
These guys are professionals.

40:39.103 --> 40:40.661
Nice bootie.

40:42.039 --> 40:44.439
-Talking about this.
-Give it up.

40:46.544 --> 40:49.445
Yes, ma'am. I understand you guys
need all the questions.

40:49.613 --> 40:51.638
I have them right here
in front of me...

40:51.816 --> 40:55.183
...but I'm in the process of
relocating offices....

40:55.352 --> 40:57.320
Maybe I can fax them
to you Iater on today?

40:57.488 --> 40:59.718
Or tomorrow, the next day,
or the day after that.

40:59.890 --> 41:03.519
-As long as we make our deadline.
-Okay, thanks. Tell Magic I said hey.

41:03.694 --> 41:04.683
-Will do.
-AII right.

41:04.862 --> 41:06.625
-Goodbye.
-Bye-bye.

41:10.301 --> 41:11.495
Peek-a-brah.

41:12.136 --> 41:13.125
What up, man?

41:13.304 --> 41:15.704
Sorry to interrupt, Mr. P.
We just need you to Iook...

41:15.873 --> 41:18.034
...sign off on phase one
of the dry-rot repair.

41:18.209 --> 41:20.302
Oh, okay. No problem.

41:20.478 --> 41:22.241
Nice. Georgie, go Iong!

41:22.413 --> 41:26.281
No, no, no. Georgie,
you don't have to go Iong.

41:26.450 --> 41:28.884
I'II just meet y'all out front.

41:29.053 --> 41:31.180
So how many phases is it?

41:31.355 --> 41:33.016
Just two.

41:33.524 --> 41:35.719
So you guys are halfway through.

41:35.893 --> 41:38.521
Oh, man, that's painless.

41:56.280 --> 41:57.577
What is this?

41:57.748 --> 41:59.409
Phase one.

41:59.583 --> 42:00.811
Phase one?

42:00.985 --> 42:02.077
Hey, Nickeroo.

42:03.521 --> 42:04.886
You.

42:05.055 --> 42:06.079
Where you been, man?

42:06.257 --> 42:08.623
Suzanne was feeling tired,
so I picked up Kev-o...

42:08.792 --> 42:09.816
...and shot some hoop.

42:09.994 --> 42:11.393
What is wrong with you?

42:11.562 --> 42:14.463
Man, you know this boy got asthma.
He can't shoot no hoops.

42:14.632 --> 42:18.762
He cured it, just Iike that.
With something called the go...?

42:19.303 --> 42:20.429
Goji berries.

42:20.604 --> 42:22.834
-Listen.
-Check it out.

42:25.409 --> 42:26.398
Inhale Iove.

42:27.711 --> 42:29.804
Exhale inclusion.

42:29.980 --> 42:33.746
It's a Iittle trick I picked up during a
fast with His Holiness in Dharamsala.

42:33.918 --> 42:35.476
And finish.

42:35.653 --> 42:38.486
Yeah, well, His Holiness
doesn't have to deal with his mother.

42:39.023 --> 42:40.388
You keep your inhaler.

42:40.558 --> 42:41.786
It was no bother.

42:41.959 --> 42:43.859
We had to stop
at Fred's hardware store...

42:44.028 --> 42:46.895
...to pick up a new tankless
water heater. Your old one's shot.

42:47.064 --> 42:51.125
Oh, so now you going out and buying
things without even asking me first.

42:52.036 --> 42:55.995
I don't know what to tell you.
It's a tankless job.

42:57.107 --> 42:59.439
-I did not--
-Yes, he did.

43:01.045 --> 43:03.946
-Good one, Chuck.
-Good one, Chuck.

43:05.583 --> 43:09.986
Oh, what a great kid. Holy moly,
does he have a terrific jump shot.

43:10.154 --> 43:12.452
Honest to goodness,
if he grows another six feet...

43:12.623 --> 43:13.988
...he's gonna be unstoppable.

43:14.158 --> 43:16.092
Hey, Nick. Look what Chuck got me.

43:16.260 --> 43:17.818
-Isn't it awesome?
-Oh, yeah.

43:22.166 --> 43:23.895
-Wait. Give me that.
-Fire! Fire! Fire!

43:24.068 --> 43:25.092
Give me this.

43:25.269 --> 43:27.260
What'd be awesome
is if you was here...

43:27.438 --> 43:29.838
...to keep these Iinebackers
from tearing up my house.

43:30.007 --> 43:31.668
Dry rot is a tricky thing.

43:31.842 --> 43:34.868
You never really know
how much damage there is....

43:35.045 --> 43:36.876
Till you get into it.

43:37.047 --> 43:41.040
It's Iike I always say, it's gonna get
ugly before it gets pretty.

43:41.218 --> 43:44.119
Let me tell you something.
We're gonna get your walls back up...

43:44.288 --> 43:46.620
...and your home
is gonna be stronger for it.

43:46.790 --> 43:50.556
It better be. If not, I'm holding you
personally responsible.

43:50.728 --> 43:53.822
So I want you to be the one
to keep your eye on this whole project.

43:53.998 --> 43:56.523
A very close eye.
Do you understand me?

43:56.700 --> 43:58.497
CIose eyes.

43:58.669 --> 44:01.934
I hear you Ioud and clear...

44:03.240 --> 44:04.798
...Nickeroo.

44:04.975 --> 44:07.170
With the gun. What are you doing?

44:07.578 --> 44:09.637
And put on some booties.

44:12.583 --> 44:17.077
It's Sunday morning, Nick. Isn't it so
nice to have the house to ourselves?

44:17.254 --> 44:18.744
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

44:23.727 --> 44:27.185
What? What is this?

44:31.335 --> 44:33.803
Hey, hey, hey.

44:33.971 --> 44:35.905
-What's up, Nick?
-What you doing?

44:36.073 --> 44:38.007
You said keep a close eye
on the project.

44:38.175 --> 44:40.439
So you going camping?

44:40.611 --> 44:43.910
That's crazy talk. I'm moving in.

44:44.348 --> 44:47.749
Chuck, what about your wife?
Doesn't she want you home?

44:47.918 --> 44:49.977
I don't even want him home.
I know she don't.

44:50.154 --> 44:54.250
Don't worry about the missus. EIIie's
on tour over in China for three months.

44:56.260 --> 44:57.386
Three months?

44:57.561 --> 44:59.756
Yeah. She's a country singer.

44:59.930 --> 45:03.229
You wouldn't believe the way
the Chinese Iove their country music.

45:03.634 --> 45:05.397
But this ain't gonna take
three months.

45:05.569 --> 45:08.094
You're right. Could take Ionger.

45:08.405 --> 45:11.966
But don't worry about me.
You won't even know I'm here.

45:13.977 --> 45:17.174
What do you say? Let's get
out there before the sun gets too hot.

45:18.182 --> 45:20.412
-Get out where?
-Chuck's taking us fishing.

45:20.584 --> 45:22.779
The sturgeon are running.
It's gonna be fantastic.

45:22.953 --> 45:25.649
-You wanna come?
-Oh, Chuck, that is a great idea.

45:25.823 --> 45:27.984
No, no, I can't go fishing.
That's a bad idea.

45:28.158 --> 45:30.592
-Why?
-I got too much work to do.

45:30.761 --> 45:34.026
I gotta set traps in case
that raccoon comes back.

45:34.198 --> 45:36.462
You know those are
vicious animals, baby.

45:36.633 --> 45:38.931
Oh, come on, Nick.
The water's not that deep.

45:39.436 --> 45:40.494
I don't care about that.

45:40.671 --> 45:43.071
Wait a minute, Nick,
are you afraid of the water?

45:43.240 --> 45:45.731
-Honey.
-No. That's ridiculous.

45:45.909 --> 45:49.401
By "no" he means yes, and by
"ridiculous" he means terrified.

45:49.580 --> 45:53.414
And he did promise
that he'd teach Kevin how to fish.

45:53.584 --> 45:57.213
Okay. AII right. Fine.
I'II go fishing.

45:57.387 --> 45:59.014
Fine.

45:59.189 --> 46:00.554
-Yes!
-Thanks, Chuck.

46:00.724 --> 46:01.850
-Yes!
-Don't mention it.

46:09.199 --> 46:12.600
I hate this. I'm gonna Iet y'all
know right now, I hate this.

46:12.770 --> 46:15.637
-Come on.
-You know what? I--

46:17.107 --> 46:19.507
I think I just swallowed a bug.

46:29.486 --> 46:30.475
Y'all see that?

46:31.121 --> 46:32.645
Stop messing around, Nick.
Come on.

46:33.590 --> 46:36.855
For real, I think we need a bigger boat.
I'm not playing.

46:37.027 --> 46:39.325
No, come on. Just take your rod...

46:40.531 --> 46:41.520
...and cast away.

46:42.166 --> 46:44.293
Don't tell me nothing
about fishing, okay?

46:44.468 --> 46:47.596
I was the king of Go Fish
in my neighborhood.

46:47.771 --> 46:49.739
This shouldn't be hard, just--

47:08.458 --> 47:10.050
I saw a shark down there.

47:10.227 --> 47:13.526
Oh, Nick, nice barrel roll.
Just real nice.

47:13.697 --> 47:16.461
That's it. I'm gone. I'm gone.

47:25.943 --> 47:27.604
-Hey, Nick?
-What?

47:27.778 --> 47:28.870
I'd be careful.

47:29.046 --> 47:32.982
Don't worry about me,
I'm on Iand now. I got this.

47:37.588 --> 47:38.577
Help!

47:40.390 --> 47:42.722
Help. Somebody.

47:47.965 --> 47:49.455
I gotta fire Chuck.

47:49.633 --> 47:51.464
Why, because he made you
go fishing?

47:51.768 --> 47:54.168
No, because he's tearing up
our house.

47:54.338 --> 47:57.739
Well, it's gonna get ugly
before it gets pretty, Nick.

47:58.876 --> 48:01.845
Don't you start quoting him
Iike he's some kind of oracle...

48:02.012 --> 48:04.003
...because he's not. He's an idiot.

48:04.181 --> 48:06.240
He's sweet.

48:08.652 --> 48:10.210
What?

48:10.821 --> 48:11.981
Nothing.

48:13.724 --> 48:17.660
Oh, Nick, I know, I know.
This has been so hard for everybody...

48:17.828 --> 48:20.729
...with this house,
and you're used to being a bachelor...

48:20.898 --> 48:25.062
...and now you've got me and the kids
and the responsibilities of this house.

48:25.235 --> 48:27.703
I know you're under
a Iot of pressure, honey.

48:28.772 --> 48:31.332
Oh, my goodness.
Come here. Feel this.

48:31.508 --> 48:33.601
Touch it, right here.

48:33.777 --> 48:34.937
Do you feel him?

48:37.681 --> 48:38.773
What is that, his butt?

48:38.949 --> 48:40.246
I think so.

48:40.717 --> 48:42.981
Isn't that the coolest thing?

48:44.621 --> 48:46.145
Did you hear that?

48:46.323 --> 48:47.517
-Boy.
-Did you hear that?

48:47.691 --> 48:50.182
-Honey, is that the raccoon?
-No.

48:50.360 --> 48:54.854
Raccoon made a scuffling sound.
That was more Iike a rustle.

49:00.671 --> 49:02.138
I think it's in the chimney.

49:17.688 --> 49:19.315
I guess I showed him.

49:19.489 --> 49:20.717
Yeah.

49:21.425 --> 49:23.552
-Yeah.
-Yeah, baby.

49:23.727 --> 49:27.390
That's right. You might
wanna close that flue, though.

49:37.541 --> 49:39.873
Leave me alone, man. Get back.

50:02.933 --> 50:05.163
Looks Iike we better put a cap
on that chimney.

50:05.769 --> 50:07.964
These guys will drive you batty.

50:09.206 --> 50:10.673
Night, neighbor.

50:11.141 --> 50:12.472
I'm sick of you.

50:21.551 --> 50:23.018
Chuck!

50:30.994 --> 50:31.983
What?

50:34.464 --> 50:36.193
-Hey, Chuck.
-Yeah?

50:36.366 --> 50:37.890
What's going on
with my glass door?

50:38.068 --> 50:40.127
Frame rotted. Ripped it out,
ordered a new one.

50:40.303 --> 50:43.101
Triple-pane xenon-filled.
Pricey, yes...

50:43.273 --> 50:46.709
...but it'II probably pay for itself
in 1 5, 20 years max.

50:46.877 --> 50:49.038
What's going on?
I need the water back.

50:49.946 --> 50:52.676
I'm guessing you didn't get
the memo.

50:52.849 --> 50:57.548
I posted it on the fridge Iate
Iast night. "Water off, 8 a.m. sharp."

50:57.721 --> 51:02.055
And I don't want you to spiral into
a worry tizzy about the H2O.

51:02.225 --> 51:04.489
It turns out your water
is pure as driven snow.

51:04.661 --> 51:07.630
It's the pipes that are the problem.
They're completely corroded.

51:07.798 --> 51:08.787
You wanna show him?

51:10.267 --> 51:13.236
I pulled this disgusting piece of pipe
from under your house.

51:13.403 --> 51:15.132
Can you see through that?

51:16.540 --> 51:17.837
Yeah, I didn't think so.

51:18.008 --> 51:20.203
If that was your artery,
you'd be dead by now.

51:20.377 --> 51:23.346
Or one side of your body would be,
Iike, totally paralyzed.

51:23.680 --> 51:27.980
Show him just exactly what
you plan to replace it with.

51:30.353 --> 51:31.752
This is 1 -inch copper piping.

51:31.922 --> 51:34.982
I'm gonna use this for the verticals,
half-inch for the horizontals.

51:35.158 --> 51:38.321
Your water pressure's gonna be
hovering at around 1 50 psi...

51:38.495 --> 51:39.655
...give or take a psi.

51:40.263 --> 51:41.321
Is that good?

51:43.967 --> 51:45.867
That is insane.

51:46.169 --> 51:49.138
Insane, huh?
Insane sounds expensive.

51:55.045 --> 51:56.637
Hey, Chuck, I Iike this guy.

51:56.813 --> 51:59.179
-He's the best. The best.
-He's funny.

51:59.349 --> 52:03.251
AII right, fellas,
Iet's go Iay some pipe.

52:09.126 --> 52:12.425
Come on, fellas, this way.
Through the bedroom.

52:14.197 --> 52:16.597
So Chuck thinks we should try
the Bradley Method.

52:17.734 --> 52:19.429
What's the Bradley Method?

52:19.603 --> 52:21.730
It's natural childbirth.

52:21.905 --> 52:23.497
You know what else
he was telling me?

52:23.673 --> 52:25.834
We should actually consider
a home birth.

52:26.843 --> 52:30.210
Home birth? With doctors coming
all in the house and stuff?

52:30.380 --> 52:32.041
-Yeah.
-I'm not sure.

52:32.215 --> 52:35.412
Okay. Well, you know,
we could always have a midwife.

52:35.685 --> 52:37.482
You mean Chuck?

52:37.654 --> 52:39.053
He studied in Switzerland.

52:39.222 --> 52:41.247
-So?
-What do you mean, "so"?

52:41.424 --> 52:43.892
I don't want him
coming nowhere near you.

52:44.060 --> 52:48.326
The thought of Chuck
just makes my stomach hurt.

52:49.966 --> 52:53.834
AII right. Well, I guess
we'II just have to talk about it Iater.

52:55.005 --> 52:56.404
Good night.

52:56.573 --> 52:59.701
-Chuck.
-Nick.

53:06.316 --> 53:07.840
Chuck.

53:14.391 --> 53:15.881
Hey there, Iittle buddy.

53:16.593 --> 53:19.221
Chuck making
your stomach hurt too?

53:20.096 --> 53:22.724
Yeah, go ahead,
help yourself. It's okay.

53:22.899 --> 53:25.732
You seem Iike a nice guy.

53:27.537 --> 53:28.697
Come to me.

53:32.709 --> 53:34.939
Hey there, Iittle buddy.

53:36.313 --> 53:38.679
You wanna be my friend, don't you?

53:38.848 --> 53:40.873
Well, truth be told, I need a--

54:06.109 --> 54:07.098
Where is she?

54:07.277 --> 54:09.108
She went to a party
at Danny's house.

54:09.512 --> 54:10.774
Dry-rot Danny?

55:24.554 --> 55:27.022
Thanks for picking me up, man.

55:27.190 --> 55:29.784
I remember sneaking out of
my bedroom when I was that age.

55:31.628 --> 55:34.062
Sweet, stolen kisses in the night.

55:34.230 --> 55:36.994
-Sometimes more than kisses, right?
-Wrong.

55:37.167 --> 55:40.330
-Right? Right?
-Wrong. Wrong.

55:42.339 --> 55:45.137
Whatever they're doing,
I'm sure it's perfectly innocent.

55:45.308 --> 55:47.833
For goodness' sake,
she's almost grown up. She's 1 5.

55:48.011 --> 55:50.775
She's only 1 3.
Practically a baby, man.

55:50.947 --> 55:53.916
I really don't wanna have this
conversation with you.

55:55.051 --> 55:56.313
Enough of this.

55:57.287 --> 56:00.484
Easy there, partner. That's my wife.

56:00.990 --> 56:03.015
-That's your wife?
-Yeah.

56:03.193 --> 56:05.491
-This is your wife?
-Right there.

56:15.338 --> 56:18.102
I Iove the way your family
treats you Iike an adult.

56:18.274 --> 56:22.142
Ever since Mom married Nick,
I've been treated Iike a kid.

56:22.612 --> 56:27.777
Well, you're way too
grown-up and pretty for that.

56:31.254 --> 56:33.188
-Lindsey.
-Nick?

56:35.058 --> 56:38.289
You're busted. Now, get up,
because you're grounded.

56:38.461 --> 56:39.655
And you, you fired.

56:39.829 --> 56:43.424
Whoa, whoa, whoa, brah.
Hang Ioose.

56:44.868 --> 56:50.738
Brah. You fired too. And your Iittle
brother. So hang Ioose with that, brah.

56:50.907 --> 56:52.306
I hate you.

56:52.475 --> 56:56.536
Well, I'm not exactly your biggest fan
right now either. Go wait in the car.

56:56.713 --> 56:58.146
Chuck, Iet's go.

57:04.020 --> 57:05.282
Chuck!

57:07.056 --> 57:08.489
Chuck!

57:09.426 --> 57:10.620
Oh, Nick.

57:18.935 --> 57:21.426
That was quite a night Iast night,
huh, Nick?

57:21.604 --> 57:23.265
Hey, Linds-o.

57:23.440 --> 57:25.374
Good morning, Lindsey.

57:26.176 --> 57:28.007
Lindsey. Good morning.

57:28.178 --> 57:30.043
Good morning.

57:31.347 --> 57:32.905
Looks Iike she's still mad at you.

57:33.082 --> 57:36.745
Yeah, well, this ain't
a popularity contest.

57:38.021 --> 57:39.511
Nick?

57:41.958 --> 57:45.450
Chuck! Come here, man.

57:49.599 --> 57:50.588
Need a hug?

57:50.767 --> 57:53.235
No, I don't need a hug.
I need my floors back.

57:53.703 --> 57:57.696
It's termites, Nick.
Straight up had to go.

58:05.248 --> 58:06.681
Want that hug now?

58:06.883 --> 58:09.477
I'm getting tired of this.

58:14.757 --> 58:16.588
You have one message.

58:16.759 --> 58:19.728
Mr. Persons,
love the magazine idea.

58:19.896 --> 58:22.956
But you are one month late
with the cover.

58:23.132 --> 58:25.191
I've stalled the board
as long as I can.

58:25.368 --> 58:26.960
Now it's my job on the line.

58:27.136 --> 58:31.266
So, Nick, if you can't get Magic,
we'll have to move on.

58:31.441 --> 58:34.604
Of course, that means refunding
your substantial cash advance.

58:34.777 --> 58:36.677
I know you understand.

58:36.846 --> 58:39.610
Thanks, doll. Call me.

58:46.556 --> 58:51.289
And, wives, let's inhale,
taking in another deep breath.

58:51.461 --> 58:53.827
And give it away on sound.

58:56.799 --> 59:01.395
There we are.
And wives are now completely relaxed.

59:01.571 --> 59:02.697
What's going on here?

59:03.473 --> 59:04.462
Nick.

59:04.641 --> 59:06.768
We're doing a sympathetic
breathing and birth--

59:06.943 --> 59:08.035
Shut up.

59:08.778 --> 59:10.769
I can't believe you're doing this
with him.

59:10.947 --> 59:12.812
I can't believe you forgot
about our class.

59:12.982 --> 59:14.973
Inhaling and staying in the exercise.

59:15.151 --> 59:18.712
I'm trying to fix our house, which is
supposed to be Chuck's job.

59:18.888 --> 59:21.083
Don't blame Chuck.
He's helping me right now.

59:21.257 --> 59:24.283
Big breath. Big breath.

59:26.663 --> 59:28.130
By rubbing all on you?

59:28.298 --> 59:30.528
No, Nick, by supporting me.

59:30.700 --> 59:32.395
I support you.

59:32.569 --> 59:34.002
I support her.

59:34.170 --> 59:37.936
I'm just trying to build our dream
house for us and the kids, that's all.

59:38.474 --> 59:42.433
Y'all just get back to relaxing.
Rub on the belly or something.

59:42.612 --> 59:47.413
You know, one of our mantras,
Nick, is that coupling is participation.

59:47.584 --> 59:48.642
I know.

59:48.818 --> 59:50.809
What we're gonna do now
is take our hand...

59:50.987 --> 59:55.822
...and go in a circular motion
around and around....

59:55.992 --> 01:00:00.986
That's the baby's house,
be very gentle. Around.

01:00:01.164 --> 01:00:03.098
This may not be
the best time to tell you...

01:00:03.266 --> 01:00:04.893
...your house needs
a new foundation.

01:00:05.068 --> 01:00:07.969
Don't Iet that interrupt the flow.

01:00:08.137 --> 01:00:12.005
-That's it! That's it!
-Nick!

01:00:14.110 --> 01:00:16.010
Come on, Nick.

01:00:16.613 --> 01:00:19.514
Somebody's having a bad day.
Now, be careful with that.

01:00:19.682 --> 01:00:23.049
That is New England mahogany trim!
I bent over backwards to get it for you.

01:00:23.219 --> 01:00:25.244
-What is up, Nick?
-This is what's up.

01:00:27.056 --> 01:00:28.648
-You played me!
-No.

01:00:28.825 --> 01:00:31.817
You knew this was a piece of junk
the minute you sold it to me.

01:00:31.995 --> 01:00:33.622
I knew the minute I met you...

01:00:33.796 --> 01:00:36.822
...that this home was meant for you!
You just needed a Iittle push.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.433
Well, here's my push.

01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:41.962
I should warn you, Nick.

01:00:42.138 --> 01:00:45.801
I am trained in capoeira,
the Brazilian dance of war.

01:00:45.975 --> 01:00:49.308
Yeah, I don't know karate,
but I know crazy.

01:00:55.351 --> 01:00:56.875
Oh, Nick!

01:01:00.189 --> 01:01:01.178
No!

01:01:02.158 --> 01:01:06.390
That was a close one. Once it gets
going, man, is it hard to stop.

01:01:06.796 --> 01:01:09.890
Get off me. You are fired!

01:01:10.466 --> 01:01:14.334
What? Nick. Nickelback. Come on,
you can't blame me for all this.

01:01:14.504 --> 01:01:18.099
No. I can. And I will. And I do!

01:01:18.274 --> 01:01:21.732
I blame you for everything, Chuck.
It's all your fault.

01:01:21.911 --> 01:01:25.938
I'm blaming you for the ozone Iayer,
global warming, the price on gas.

01:01:26.115 --> 01:01:27.480
It's all your fault.

01:01:27.650 --> 01:01:32.451
So get off my property,
get out my face and get out my Iife.

01:01:32.622 --> 01:01:37.491
No, no, no, Nick. The good news here
is that all we need is some therapy.

01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:41.096
Nick, we can work our way
through this, and guess what.

01:01:41.264 --> 01:01:44.563
I'm a Iicensed couples therapist.
I am.

01:01:44.734 --> 01:01:47.828
I see this tension happening
between contractors and clients...

01:01:48.004 --> 01:01:48.993
...all the time.

01:01:49.172 --> 01:01:51.003
It's the bread and butter
of my practice.

01:01:51.174 --> 01:01:53.233
But just admit this one thing to me.
One thing.

01:01:53.409 --> 01:01:54.740
What?

01:01:55.378 --> 01:01:58.905
You never would've bought
this place if it hadn't been for me.

01:01:59.282 --> 01:02:00.510
Exactly.

01:02:00.683 --> 01:02:03.652
Why is that? I'II tell you why.
I'II tell you why that is.

01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:06.986
Because I knew what you didn't.

01:02:07.457 --> 01:02:10.893
Yes, I knew there was
more work to be done here.

01:02:11.194 --> 01:02:13.594
But I also knew the value
of this place.

01:02:13.763 --> 01:02:15.390
I knew that when you were done...

01:02:15.565 --> 01:02:17.829
...that this was gonna
be a home for your family...

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:21.936
...not some stinking house. I got them
up to here, they're a dime a dozen.

01:02:22.105 --> 01:02:24.767
But a home, a home, Nick.

01:02:25.608 --> 01:02:27.269
This is it.

01:02:27.443 --> 01:02:29.001
Your home.

01:02:29.812 --> 01:02:32.645
Does this Iook Iike a home to you?

01:02:35.551 --> 01:02:37.883
This is a mess!

01:02:38.054 --> 01:02:40.921
I need you out of here, right now.

01:02:41.791 --> 01:02:43.224
Well, if you--

01:02:43.392 --> 01:02:47.954
If you can't see the value of a home
as opposed to a house...

01:02:48.131 --> 01:02:51.362
...maybe I'm not your guy.

01:03:00.676 --> 01:03:01.768
Where y'all going?

01:03:02.178 --> 01:03:04.237
It's called Ioyalty, Mr. Persons.

01:03:04.413 --> 01:03:08.440
We work for Chuck.
And if he goes, we go.

01:03:08.618 --> 01:03:10.245
Well, then go.

01:03:10.419 --> 01:03:13.980
I don't need none of you.
I can do it myself.

01:03:31.674 --> 01:03:33.904
I don't know what you
were thinking, Nick.

01:03:34.076 --> 01:03:37.637
You're gonna have to realize that
we're gonna have to hire Chuck back.

01:03:37.814 --> 01:03:40.942
What? Oh, no, no.
That's never gonna happen, all right?

01:03:41.117 --> 01:03:42.482
Nobody takes me for a ride...

01:03:42.652 --> 01:03:45.246
...so he's never stepping foot
in this house again.

01:03:45.421 --> 01:03:48.822
Chuck is caring, and he cares
about this family.

01:03:48.991 --> 01:03:52.256
What he needs to do is move back
with his own family.

01:03:52.428 --> 01:03:55.920
It's not normal for a contractor
to Iive with his clients, Suzanne.

01:03:56.098 --> 01:03:59.124
I understand that, but it's been
fun having him around, Nick...

01:03:59.302 --> 01:04:00.929
...and he's great with the kids.

01:04:01.103 --> 01:04:05.506
No, he's not. He's the one tearing this
family apart, that's what he's doing.

01:04:05.675 --> 01:04:08.610
He's the one tearing
this family apart?

01:04:09.212 --> 01:04:11.373
You're the one tearing
this family apart, Nick.

01:04:12.648 --> 01:04:14.309
-Me?
-Yes, you.

01:04:14.483 --> 01:04:17.543
With your insane obsession
with this house.

01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:20.086
You don't have to worry
about that anymore.

01:04:20.256 --> 01:04:21.723
Got the perfect idea.

01:04:21.891 --> 01:04:23.916
This house is driving
everybody crazy...

01:04:24.093 --> 01:04:26.823
...so I say we just move on
and cut our Iosses.

01:04:26.996 --> 01:04:29.521
Oh, and where are we gonna go,
Nick, to your condo?

01:04:29.699 --> 01:04:31.030
Anywhere but here.

01:04:32.902 --> 01:04:38.135
Nick. Nick. We cannot keep
uprooting our family Iike this.

01:04:38.307 --> 01:04:40.935
Who was the one crying
that we needed a bigger place?

01:04:41.110 --> 01:04:43.442
AII right? Now, I wouldn't
be stuck with this dump...

01:04:43.613 --> 01:04:46.707
...if it wasn't for you
and these ungrateful kids.

01:04:48.150 --> 01:04:49.378
Nick.

01:04:51.153 --> 01:04:52.780
Suzanne, I didn't mean that. Come--

01:04:52.955 --> 01:04:56.015
-Hold on. I didn't mean that.
-No. No. Don't touch me right now.

01:04:56.726 --> 01:04:58.785
I'm just under so much pressure.

01:04:58.961 --> 01:05:00.394
And I'm not under pressure?

01:05:00.563 --> 01:05:04.294
I'm the one who's having babies
that I'm not even sure you want.

01:05:18.514 --> 01:05:20.641
I really think you're overreacting.

01:05:21.651 --> 01:05:24.950
I think we need to spend
some time apart, Nick.

01:05:26.088 --> 01:05:28.113
Come on, now.

01:05:29.258 --> 01:05:32.352
When we first got here, these kids
were not happy about being here...

01:05:32.528 --> 01:05:34.189
...but now they're vested in this.

01:05:34.363 --> 01:05:37.924
So, what are we gonna do? Just take
that all away because it's difficult?

01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:39.829
Is that the thing you
wanna teach Kevin?

01:05:40.002 --> 01:05:42.596
That when the going gets tough,
you just quit?

01:05:43.739 --> 01:05:47.140
You should try putting that
on the cover of your magazine.

01:05:48.411 --> 01:05:50.606
Look at you. I mean,
you quitting on me right now.

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:54.511
I am not quitting,
I just need time to think.

01:05:56.619 --> 01:05:57.950
Suzanne.

01:05:59.188 --> 01:06:01.247
Where you gonna go?

01:06:08.431 --> 01:06:10.058
Oh, not you guys too?

01:06:10.433 --> 01:06:11.957
Just cutting our Iosses.

01:06:12.134 --> 01:06:13.624
Kevin, I know you understand.

01:06:13.803 --> 01:06:15.202
Not now, Nick, I'm busy.

01:06:15.504 --> 01:06:17.836
Well, you're gonna thank me
when we out of here.

01:06:18.307 --> 01:06:21.037
You city kids and you know it.

01:06:22.611 --> 01:06:25.307
Coco, get in the house.

01:06:26.882 --> 01:06:29.612
I said, get in the house,
you ignorant mutt.

01:06:29.952 --> 01:06:31.647
Coco!

01:06:37.426 --> 01:06:38.723
Coco.

01:06:42.198 --> 01:06:44.029
I'm sorry.

01:09:00.502 --> 01:09:02.095
What you doing?

01:09:02.270 --> 01:09:06.037
Jason Winchell caught an 8-pound
bass and brought it to school.

01:09:06.207 --> 01:09:08.005
Well, actually, just the head.

01:09:08.410 --> 01:09:11.868
But it was so big, you could fit
your whole hand in its mouth.

01:09:12.915 --> 01:09:14.678
Chuck was supposed
to take me fishing.

01:09:14.850 --> 01:09:17.580
That is, until you fired him.

01:09:17.752 --> 01:09:20.620
You know what?
Why don't we just go now?

01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:22.988
Really?

01:09:23.158 --> 01:09:24.990
Come on. Let's try it.

01:09:32.201 --> 01:09:37.832
Hey. I know it's been kind of hard,
making the move and all.

01:09:38.006 --> 01:09:40.305
And I haven't actually been around.

01:09:40.676 --> 01:09:43.509
Well, I've been around,
but I haven't been around, around.

01:09:43.679 --> 01:09:45.078
Know what I mean?

01:09:45.247 --> 01:09:48.648
-Yeah.
-Well...

01:09:48.817 --> 01:09:51.684
...I'm here to Iet you know
that all that's gonna change.

01:09:52.854 --> 01:09:54.516
Because FYI...

01:09:54.857 --> 01:09:56.882
...I think you're a cool son.

01:09:57.893 --> 01:09:59.588
Thanks.

01:10:00.629 --> 01:10:02.062
And you're a cool dad.

01:10:04.934 --> 01:10:06.333
Kevin!

01:10:18.547 --> 01:10:19.673
What was that?

01:10:19.848 --> 01:10:22.510
I don't know.
But he messed with the wrong kid.

01:10:24.286 --> 01:10:25.878
Get him, Nick!

01:10:41.403 --> 01:10:43.928
I got him! Stay back!

01:10:44.106 --> 01:10:46.768
Yeah! You tell Jason Winchell
that the fish he caught...

01:10:46.942 --> 01:10:50.571
...wasn't nothing but bait, baby!
Yeah!

01:10:53.882 --> 01:10:56.476
Hey, hey. Hold up.

01:10:56.652 --> 01:10:58.313
Forgetting something.

01:10:58.487 --> 01:11:00.512
Lunch money.

01:11:00.689 --> 01:11:03.021
Thanks. Bye.

01:11:05.461 --> 01:11:08.294
-How's your mother?
-She's fine.

01:11:09.164 --> 01:11:12.065
You're not gonna have
a heart attack out here, are you?

01:11:12.601 --> 01:11:15.468
If I do, just pull my body
behind the shed.

01:11:16.272 --> 01:11:17.762
My pleasure.

01:11:18.807 --> 01:11:20.707
Lindsey.

01:11:20.876 --> 01:11:24.004
I know you're still mad at me,
but I'm trying to get it right.

01:11:24.179 --> 01:11:28.138
It's a new family, a new house.
It's all new to me.

01:11:28.317 --> 01:11:31.115
But I'II try to be
more understanding.

01:11:31.287 --> 01:11:35.246
Okay, okay, okay. I probably should've
handled the party a Iittle differently.

01:11:36.792 --> 01:11:39.886
I'm sorry, Nick.
I should've asked you.

01:11:40.763 --> 01:11:42.822
Does this mean
I can see Danny again?

01:11:43.799 --> 01:11:45.596
Don't push it.

01:11:46.402 --> 01:11:48.666
Go ahead and make your bus.

01:11:49.438 --> 01:11:52.498
-Good morning, Mr. Rooney.
-Hey, hi, sweetie.

01:11:54.376 --> 01:11:58.676
Hey. This is for you.
Thought maybe you could use this.

01:11:59.481 --> 01:12:00.573
How's the house coming?

01:12:00.883 --> 01:12:02.214
It's coming.

01:12:02.384 --> 01:12:03.908
Hey, how is Chuck doing?

01:12:04.086 --> 01:12:05.348
Don't know and don't care.

01:12:07.556 --> 01:12:10.218
Boy, I hope he's okay.
This is a tough time of year for him.

01:12:10.592 --> 01:12:11.923
Oh, yeah? Why's that?

01:12:12.094 --> 01:12:15.461
His wife. He Iost his wife a few years
back around this time of year.

01:12:16.865 --> 01:12:18.332
You didn't know, did you?

01:12:19.134 --> 01:12:21.694
Oh, yeah, she was
really something special.

01:12:22.071 --> 01:12:24.005
He's never been the same since.

01:12:24.173 --> 01:12:26.903
She was his entire world.

01:12:45.694 --> 01:12:48.322
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

01:12:48.731 --> 01:12:50.358
I heard about EIIie.

01:12:52.234 --> 01:12:53.792
Come in.

01:13:12.388 --> 01:13:15.585
Hey, I got a Iittle organic
herbal maté going here.

01:13:15.758 --> 01:13:17.350
Thanks.

01:13:18.494 --> 01:13:21.986
-Can I tell you something?
-Yeah, shoot.

01:13:22.965 --> 01:13:25.433
When I was working on
your home with you...

01:13:25.601 --> 01:13:27.193
...to me...

01:13:27.970 --> 01:13:29.904
...it felt Iike family.

01:13:30.072 --> 01:13:35.533
It felt Iike the special stuff,
you know? The stuff you hang on to.

01:13:35.711 --> 01:13:38.771
Stuff that's gone missing
around here for quite some time.

01:13:39.448 --> 01:13:40.847
It's funny, I....

01:13:42.084 --> 01:13:44.609
I can't even go inside anymore.

01:13:46.555 --> 01:13:48.420
Look, Nick...

01:13:49.124 --> 01:13:51.422
...I know I screwed your Iife up.

01:13:51.593 --> 01:13:56.155
And I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry,
you got no idea.

01:13:56.331 --> 01:13:58.731
You didn't screw my Iife up.

01:13:58.901 --> 01:14:00.630
I did.

01:14:01.603 --> 01:14:04.128
And you'II always
be a part of my family.

01:14:09.011 --> 01:14:11.741
I actually came over here
to make sure you was okay.

01:14:12.114 --> 01:14:16.448
I was so upset about how things
were going over at your place, I just....

01:14:16.618 --> 01:14:21.988
I went ahead and Iet Magic know that
you really, really need to speak to him.

01:14:22.157 --> 01:14:26.093
Man, that's great. That's great, man.
I really need it.

01:14:26.261 --> 01:14:29.355
While I was at it, I also happened
to have put my Realtor's cap on...

01:14:29.531 --> 01:14:31.465
...and I made a couple
of phone calls.

01:14:31.633 --> 01:14:33.931
I got a Russian banker
coming out here next Friday.

01:14:34.102 --> 01:14:35.729
Just might be very motivated.

01:14:35.904 --> 01:14:39.271
If you get the roof up on that place,
you might be able to flip it.

01:14:39.441 --> 01:14:43.241
Get out from underneath
the whole thing.

01:14:43.812 --> 01:14:46.042
Well, Iet me get the roof on.

01:14:46.482 --> 01:14:50.885
Do you have a nail gun with the
air compressor? The whole unit?

01:14:51.053 --> 01:14:53.180
No. I'm old-school with it.

01:14:53.355 --> 01:14:57.519
Oh, you're doing it old-school
between now and next Friday?

01:14:58.060 --> 01:15:01.223
Maybe just borrow mine.
That'd be good.

01:15:01.964 --> 01:15:05.365
Thanks, Chuck.
Thanks for everything.

01:15:05.767 --> 01:15:07.257
You got it.

01:15:37.499 --> 01:15:41.265
You can ground me Iater,
but right now, you need help.

01:15:47.776 --> 01:15:51.576
Mr. P, the Iittle Pulu
has something to tell you.

01:15:55.951 --> 01:15:57.145
I'm sorry about the party.

01:15:57.719 --> 01:16:00.051
I should have never taken
Lindsey without asking you.

01:16:00.556 --> 01:16:02.080
You got that right.

01:16:02.491 --> 01:16:04.721
And if it's all right with you...

01:16:04.893 --> 01:16:07.555
...me and my brothers would
really Iike to finish this job.

01:16:10.365 --> 01:16:14.699
Hey, fellas! I got some great news.
Tremendous news.

01:16:14.870 --> 01:16:17.862
We are not just working
on a house anymore.

01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:21.305
From now on, we're committing
to finishing a home.

01:16:21.910 --> 01:16:25.107
You heard it, baby.
We're gonna finish Nick's home.

01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:27.043
Check that for dry rot.

01:16:27.683 --> 01:16:30.743
You. I'm so darn proud
of you right now.

01:16:30.919 --> 01:16:34.047
You're making me feel a Iittle
"Nickeladocious," I'm not gonna Iie.

01:16:34.222 --> 01:16:37.817
I just wanna give you a hug on your
Nickelback, my old "Nickabocker."

01:16:37.993 --> 01:16:39.824
My Nick at Nite.

01:16:40.429 --> 01:16:41.862
Enough!

01:16:42.864 --> 01:16:45.628
Well, you caught me just
in the "Nick o' time."

01:16:46.568 --> 01:16:48.559
Is it a blessing or a curse?

01:17:39.488 --> 01:17:41.422
Go ahead, try it.

01:17:44.926 --> 01:17:47.952
Let's go. Hey, hey, hey.

01:17:56.805 --> 01:17:58.397
-Suzanne.
-Nick.

01:17:58.573 --> 01:18:01.371
Now, before you say anything,
I need to get this out, okay?

01:18:01.543 --> 01:18:04.842
-Okay.
-Now, you was right, and I was a fool.

01:18:05.013 --> 01:18:06.913
The house is just a house...

01:18:07.883 --> 01:18:10.443
...and it'd never be a home
without you and the kids and--

01:18:10.619 --> 01:18:14.077
-Yes, baby, I get it.
-I'm almost finished.

01:18:14.256 --> 01:18:17.885
Would you please consider forgiving
me and coming back home?

01:18:18.293 --> 01:18:19.385
Babies.

01:18:19.561 --> 01:18:22.325
Babies? You know, we can work
on that once you drop those two.

01:18:22.497 --> 01:18:24.055
I don't think it's
a good idea to--

01:18:24.232 --> 01:18:26.894
-Babies.
-Babies?

01:18:27.235 --> 01:18:29.863
-Babies, Nick!
-Oh, babies!

01:18:30.038 --> 01:18:32.905
Okay. Let me get you to the car.
Come on. Come on.

01:18:33.075 --> 01:18:35.373
-Honey, how far is the hospital?
-About a half-hour.

01:18:35.544 --> 01:18:37.034
Nick, we can't wait that Iong!

01:18:37.212 --> 01:18:40.739
We gotta. That's where the doctors
and nurses and all the equipment--

01:18:40.916 --> 01:18:44.113
-You're hurting my hand now.
-Honey, it is happening now!

01:18:44.286 --> 01:18:45.651
-Now?
-Now!

01:18:45.821 --> 01:18:48.312
Okay, kids, get them bags
in the house.

01:18:48.490 --> 01:18:52.187
Look, your mom about to have what
she always wanted, a home birth.

01:18:53.361 --> 01:18:56.524
Oh, Nick. I Iove the floors. Teak?

01:18:56.698 --> 01:18:58.996
Oh, no. That's bubinga.

01:19:01.770 --> 01:19:06.230
Nick, slow it down. I'm hot, honey.
I'm hot. Get it off.

01:19:06.408 --> 01:19:07.966
Well, what now?

01:19:08.143 --> 01:19:10.236
I don't know. I thought you knew.

01:19:13.949 --> 01:19:15.678
What you trying to say, baby?

01:19:15.851 --> 01:19:17.113
Chuck!

01:19:17.285 --> 01:19:20.846
Chuck? I'II go this way!
I'II go this way!

01:19:21.022 --> 01:19:23.183
Oh, Nick, I'm gonna kill you.

01:19:23.358 --> 01:19:26.054
- For what?
-You did this to me.

01:19:27.729 --> 01:19:30.357
Hello? Nickster, how we--?

01:19:30.532 --> 01:19:32.124
You what?

01:19:34.970 --> 01:19:40.772
Okay. Keep this Iine open.
Chuck is in the truck.

01:19:52.287 --> 01:19:54.585
Oh, come on!

01:20:01.163 --> 01:20:03.028
Okay.

01:20:03.198 --> 01:20:05.428
Baby, is he on his way?

01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:07.500
That was him.
He's on his way. Don't worry.

01:20:07.669 --> 01:20:09.534
-Everything gonna be fine.
-Are you sure?

01:20:09.704 --> 01:20:11.638
Go wait for Chuck downstairs.

01:20:19.314 --> 01:20:22.909
Hello? Nick? Chuck had
a Iittle trouble with the truck.

01:20:23.084 --> 01:20:24.574
But don't worry, I'm on my way.

01:20:24.753 --> 01:20:26.186
Man, just tell me what to do.

01:20:26.354 --> 01:20:30.484
Okay, now, tell Suzanne to
stay calm, and to breathe.

01:20:30.659 --> 01:20:32.718
Okay, you got to stay
calm and breathe.

01:20:32.894 --> 01:20:34.418
-I'm breathing.
-She's breathing.

01:20:34.596 --> 01:20:35.790
Now tell her to relax.

01:20:35.964 --> 01:20:39.161
Maybe do the color imaging
we worked so very hard on.

01:20:39.334 --> 01:20:40.892
Baby, relax!

01:20:41.069 --> 01:20:42.161
Honey, I'm relaxing.

01:20:42.337 --> 01:20:44.805
-Don't yell at me!
-Honey, I'm not yelling!

01:20:44.973 --> 01:20:47.533
Keep her breathing, Nick.
Put Lindsey on the phone, please.

01:20:47.876 --> 01:20:49.776
-He wants to talk to you.
-Why?

01:20:51.146 --> 01:20:54.047
-Who knows? Here.
-Hey, Chuck.

01:20:54.216 --> 01:20:56.184
I want you to Iisten very carefully.

01:20:56.351 --> 01:20:57.978
I need you to grab me some things.

01:20:58.153 --> 01:21:00.587
I need a bucket of hot water,
an oral thermometer...

01:21:00.755 --> 01:21:04.748
...Iatex gloves, towels, a shoestring
and some jalapeño hot sauce.

01:21:05.493 --> 01:21:07.256
Hot sauce?

01:21:07.429 --> 01:21:09.363
Get that for me.
Put Nick on the phone.

01:21:09.531 --> 01:21:11.396
-Okay, Chuck.
-I am almost there.

01:21:11.566 --> 01:21:14.535
I want you to go into the bathroom
and get some hand sanitizer.

01:21:14.703 --> 01:21:15.863
Don't tell me what to do.

01:21:16.037 --> 01:21:19.063
I'm gonna go in the bathroom
and find the hand sanitizer.

01:21:20.275 --> 01:21:21.572
Okay, got it. What now?

01:21:21.743 --> 01:21:23.904
We're gonna use that
to sterilize your hands.

01:21:24.079 --> 01:21:25.444
Why? I'm not touching nothing.

01:21:25.881 --> 01:21:26.939
Nick, you are.

01:21:27.115 --> 01:21:30.141
Oh, God, they're coming! Honey?

01:21:31.887 --> 01:21:34.117
How far apart would you say
the contractions are?

01:21:34.289 --> 01:21:36.757
Fast and furious, Chuck.
Fast and furious.

01:21:36.925 --> 01:21:38.950
Pillow! I need a pillow.

01:21:39.127 --> 01:21:40.492
Okay, game time, baby.

01:21:40.662 --> 01:21:44.564
Go down there and see if
the first baby is crowning.

01:21:44.733 --> 01:21:46.098
Come on, man, what that mean?

01:21:46.268 --> 01:21:48.463
Can you see the baby?

01:21:54.876 --> 01:21:56.741
Oh, God.

01:21:56.912 --> 01:21:58.709
It's Iike the guppies all over again.

01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:00.609
-Honey?
-Chuck, he's down.

01:22:00.782 --> 01:22:02.977
That's what the
jalapeño hot sauce is for.

01:22:03.151 --> 01:22:05.312
Give him a Iittle dash of that.

01:22:06.655 --> 01:22:08.122
Hold on.

01:22:16.898 --> 01:22:17.887
He's back.

01:22:18.066 --> 01:22:21.331
-Put your father back on the phone.
-Yeah.

01:22:21.503 --> 01:22:25.234
I need you to go in there,
grab that baby's head, gently.

01:22:25.407 --> 01:22:27.102
For God's sake, gently.

01:22:27.509 --> 01:22:31.639
Give it a pull. Then take the
shoestring and tie off the cord.

01:22:32.213 --> 01:22:37.412
-Hello? Hello?
-Hello? Hello?

01:22:39.187 --> 01:22:42.179
I Iost him. Are you sure
you don't wanna try a hospital?

01:22:43.892 --> 01:22:45.757
Guess that means no.

01:22:45.927 --> 01:22:49.488
Oh, so close. I just missed
the state record. Let's--

01:22:49.664 --> 01:22:51.825
-How's the patient doing here?
-Oh, Chuck.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:53.433
Let's go into our fun breathing.

01:22:53.601 --> 01:22:56.161
Let's go into a deep, warm place,
and a quiet place.

01:22:56.338 --> 01:22:58.636
Okay, quiet and deep.

01:23:03.278 --> 01:23:05.269
Family, Iet's breathe together.

01:23:06.848 --> 01:23:08.213
Now we're releasing on sound.

01:23:11.386 --> 01:23:14.412
Nick, I can't take that noise.
I can't take that noise.

01:23:14.589 --> 01:23:17.251
Hey, Iook, I'm having a baby.
I can't talk right now.

01:23:17.425 --> 01:23:21.191
-Yo, Nick, it's Earvin Johnson.
-Magic?

01:23:21.363 --> 01:23:23.263
Chuck Mitchell said you need
to talk to me.

01:23:23.431 --> 01:23:26.025
Look, my wife having a baby
right now. We can't talk.

01:23:26.201 --> 01:23:29.034
I remember when I had mine.

01:23:30.438 --> 01:23:32.372
Yup. That's how I remembered it.

01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:37.409
Tell Magic Chuck-dog said,
"Holler. Much respect. You the man."

01:23:37.579 --> 01:23:41.037
Chuck-dog said,
"Much respect. You the man."

01:23:41.216 --> 01:23:43.548
Tell Chuck-dog he's the man.

01:23:44.586 --> 01:23:46.178
Yo, Chuck, he said you the man.

01:23:46.354 --> 01:23:47.821
Oh, natch. That's so Magic.

01:23:47.989 --> 01:23:51.186
Hey, man, what's up with the
Lakers, man? Y'all need a center.

01:23:51.359 --> 01:23:52.883
He wants to talk to you, Chuck.

01:23:53.061 --> 01:23:54.790
Roundy-round. Roundy-round.

01:23:54.963 --> 01:23:56.260
Hello?

01:23:56.431 --> 01:23:58.365
You got your hands full over there.

01:23:58.533 --> 01:24:00.933
Ask Nick if he has
any more questions for me.

01:24:01.102 --> 01:24:03.570
You have any questions
for the greatest point guard...

01:24:03.738 --> 01:24:05.069
...in the history of the NBA?

01:24:05.373 --> 01:24:08.467
Oh, yeah. In that '85 series
against the Celtics...

01:24:08.643 --> 01:24:10.804
...was that a true crossover?
Because it Iooked--

01:24:10.979 --> 01:24:12.412
Knock it off!

01:24:12.580 --> 01:24:14.707
So gotta go. Bye, Buck.

01:24:14.883 --> 01:24:17.374
-I need you, baby.
-Look, it's showtime now, okay?

01:24:17.552 --> 01:24:21.989
-We got this. We got this. AII right?
-Okay. We got this. Okay.

01:24:25.326 --> 01:24:27.521
Oh, God.

01:24:31.166 --> 01:24:32.360
Told you it'd be beautiful.

01:24:33.768 --> 01:24:38.705
Oh, before I forget, I got you
kind of a homewarming gift.

01:24:40.542 --> 01:24:41.566
AII the best.

01:24:43.445 --> 01:24:44.537
Yo, Chuck.

01:24:46.781 --> 01:24:48.908
Thanks for coming back, man.

01:24:49.384 --> 01:24:51.750
You kidding me?
I'm stuck on you, Nick.

01:25:11.339 --> 01:25:12.738
And so it goes.

01:25:12.907 --> 01:25:15.535
You know, sometimes life
throws you a changeup...

01:25:15.710 --> 01:25:18.474
...and you've just got to adjust.

01:25:21.683 --> 01:25:24.447
I never did finish
the sports magazine.

01:25:24.619 --> 01:25:27.713
Instead, I started something
completely different.

01:25:27.889 --> 01:25:31.017
A different magazine,
a lot closer to my heart...

01:25:31.192 --> 01:25:33.592
...inspired by rebuilding this house.

01:25:33.761 --> 01:25:36.821
It's called Are We Done Yet?

01:25:36.998 --> 01:25:40.695
And that's the story on how
we built our dream house.

01:25:43.371 --> 01:25:44.770
Thank you.

01:25:48.076 --> 01:25:51.842
So I want to thank you all for coming.
Enjoy the party.
