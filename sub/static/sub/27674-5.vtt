WEBVTT

00:00.360 --> 00:02.884
- There was a lot of
movement in the lounge.

00:02.884 --> 00:04.540
- Oh shit!

00:04.540 --> 00:05.373
Oh my god.

00:05.373 --> 00:08.010
- Yeah, the back at the back, at the back!

00:08.010 --> 00:10.031
- [Hunter] Stop running!

00:10.031 --> 00:11.135
(groaning)

00:11.135 --> 00:12.669
Your time on the run is over!

00:12.669 --> 00:13.502
- Yes!
(cheering and clapping)

00:13.502 --> 00:14.920
Get in there.

00:14.920 --> 00:17.380
- [Narrator] With four fugitives captured,

00:17.380 --> 00:19.730
six remain at large.

00:19.730 --> 00:20.730
- We need your help.

00:21.810 --> 00:24.730
- [Narrator] If they can
evade the hunters for 25 days.

00:24.730 --> 00:26.290
- [Man] Shit's just got real.

00:26.290 --> 00:28.797
- [Narrator] They'll
win a share of Â£100,000.

00:28.797 --> 00:31.960
(knocking on door)

00:31.960 --> 00:34.760
- She's rung her mom 247 times in a month,

00:34.760 --> 00:36.140
according to the phone billing.

00:36.140 --> 00:38.060
- I'd like to know that mum's okay.

00:38.060 --> 00:41.263
- She's hungry, disorientated, tired.

00:42.538 --> 00:43.947
- [Loren] I don't think they're coming.

00:43.947 --> 00:45.233
I'm lost and lonely.

00:47.073 --> 00:48.600
- We're gonna take the
fight to the Hunters,

00:48.600 --> 00:50.555
and we're gonna leave 'em
bruised and red faced.

00:50.555 --> 00:51.600
(blowing raspberries)

00:51.600 --> 00:53.060
- Undoubtedly, it's gonna be

00:53.060 --> 00:54.850
a fellow marine who's helpin' him.

00:54.850 --> 00:55.998
- [Matt] John!

00:55.998 --> 00:56.831
- Good to see you, mate.

00:56.831 --> 00:59.000
- John Peel, from the Marine Network.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.750
- [Hunter] We've got CCTV.

01:00.750 --> 01:02.890
- [Peter] He thinks
he's on bloody holiday.

01:02.890 --> 01:03.860
- He's with Peel.

01:03.860 --> 01:05.993
- New plan, if I stay at yours tonight.

01:07.173 --> 01:09.850
- [Hunter] Urgent update,
John Peel's heading home.

01:09.850 --> 01:11.197
- Yes, we're going to get him!

01:11.197 --> 01:12.570
- ETA 12 minutes.

01:12.570 --> 01:16.353
- If he's in Peel's vehicle,
we're going to catch him.

01:16.353 --> 01:18.847
(Matt laughing)

01:18.847 --> 01:21.347
(tense music)

01:35.505 --> 01:37.269
- Staying at a friends like this,

01:37.269 --> 01:40.090
there's always a huge
element of risk there.

01:40.090 --> 01:41.130
I'm sort of one foot out of the woods,

01:41.130 --> 01:42.763
one foot in the woods.

01:43.949 --> 01:44.782
(phone ringing)

01:44.782 --> 01:46.800
- [Narrator] Matt Mason plans to lay low

01:46.800 --> 01:49.160
at associate John Peel's house,

01:49.160 --> 01:52.435
if John's wife confirms it's safe.

01:52.435 --> 01:53.840
- [Wife] Hello?

01:53.840 --> 01:56.150
- Is there fish and chips on tonight?

01:56.150 --> 01:57.706
- [Wife] Yeah that'll be fine.

01:57.706 --> 01:59.199
- Okiedokie.

01:59.199 --> 02:00.640
It's all clear there.

02:00.640 --> 02:01.813
- It's all clear there.

02:04.910 --> 02:06.700
- Guys, I've just intercepted a call

02:06.700 --> 02:08.483
made by John Peel's handset.

02:08.483 --> 02:09.316
- [Wife] Hello?

02:09.316 --> 02:12.399
- [John] Is there fish
and chips on tonight?

02:12.399 --> 02:14.504
- [Wife] Yeah, that'll be fine.

02:14.504 --> 02:15.970
- Is there fish and chips on tonight?

02:15.970 --> 02:17.982
- It's probably code for
"Is the coast clear?"

02:17.982 --> 02:20.110
- [John] See you soon, bye.

02:20.110 --> 02:20.943
- Checking ahead, init?

02:20.943 --> 02:22.890
Fish and chips, is it all
right to bring him home?

02:22.890 --> 02:24.270
Any hunters been round?

02:24.270 --> 02:25.160
- [Zoe] Oh my God.

02:25.160 --> 02:26.760
We could be right on top of him.

02:27.990 --> 02:29.040
- Really bad feeling.

02:30.040 --> 02:32.225
Feeling uneasy.

02:32.225 --> 02:33.640
Again, it's how would they know?

02:33.640 --> 02:36.400
How have they worked it out?

02:36.400 --> 02:38.697
They might be sat outside.

02:38.697 --> 02:39.797
- You just don't know.

02:40.728 --> 02:43.228
(tense music)

02:45.950 --> 02:46.950
- [Hunter] Where abouts
are you at the moment?

02:46.950 --> 02:48.470
What have you got eyes on?

02:48.470 --> 02:50.380
- We are outside the property,

02:50.380 --> 02:52.220
waiting for the car to come back.

02:52.220 --> 02:53.270
- Roger that.

02:53.270 --> 02:54.153
Twitchy bum time.

02:57.050 --> 02:57.950
- What's that car?

02:58.920 --> 03:00.840
- We've got further AMPR hits.

03:00.840 --> 03:02.890
ETA three minutes.

03:02.890 --> 03:04.670
ETA three minutes.

03:04.670 --> 03:05.853
Come on, be in the car.

03:07.146 --> 03:09.646
(tense music)

03:11.820 --> 03:12.653
- [Hunter] Car, car, car,

03:12.653 --> 03:14.627
car, car, car.
- Who's there?

03:15.654 --> 03:17.137
- [Ben] Received.

03:17.137 --> 03:18.502
(tense music)

03:18.502 --> 03:20.669
(sighing)

03:25.036 --> 03:26.832
- Go, go, go, go, go.

03:26.832 --> 03:29.582
(dramatic music)

03:33.512 --> 03:36.518
You've been caught, you've
been hunted, Matt Mason!

03:36.518 --> 03:37.904
You're time on the run is over.

03:37.904 --> 03:39.680
- [Hunter] Happy. (laughing)

03:39.680 --> 03:40.753
- Good effort.

03:40.753 --> 03:42.102
- Yes, get in there!

03:42.102 --> 03:43.442
(cheering and clapping)

03:43.442 --> 03:47.124
(hunters laughing)

03:47.124 --> 03:48.977
- I'm gutted but you know what,

03:48.977 --> 03:50.859
that's life, isn't it?

03:50.859 --> 03:52.603
- I need to sit down
before I fall over here.

03:52.603 --> 03:53.558
(groaning)

03:53.558 --> 03:54.391
(clapping)

03:54.391 --> 03:55.224
- [Woman] Absolutely.

03:55.224 --> 03:56.653
- [Ben] Hello Mr Mason,
thank you very much mate.

03:56.653 --> 03:57.720
It's been--

03:57.720 --> 03:58.553
- Good effort.

03:58.553 --> 04:01.421
- You've made us work really, really hard.

04:01.421 --> 04:03.830
(clapping)

04:03.830 --> 04:05.841
What was really good is Royal Marines,

04:05.841 --> 04:08.730
numerous times in
Afghanistan has been nicked

04:08.730 --> 04:10.515
by a five foot two lady.

04:10.515 --> 04:11.610
(both laughing)

04:11.610 --> 04:12.737
- Get back to work.

04:12.737 --> 04:14.690
(hunters laughing)

04:14.690 --> 04:16.380
- The plan was always to get him

04:16.380 --> 04:17.990
to come to us, and that's exactly

04:17.990 --> 04:22.520
what we did, and I'm really
pleased about it. (laughing)

04:22.520 --> 04:23.353
I am.

04:24.204 --> 04:25.700
- [Matt] I don't think I did myself proud,

04:25.700 --> 04:27.233
because I didn't get to the end.

04:27.233 --> 04:29.467
I was in it to win it.

04:29.467 --> 04:31.080
I'm not just representing myself,

04:31.080 --> 04:33.343
I'm representing a wide body of men.

04:34.740 --> 04:36.220
One thing I did do was I put my money

04:36.220 --> 04:38.360
where my mouth was, I went for it,

04:38.360 --> 04:40.810
and I gave it a crack,
and that's the main thing.

04:45.560 --> 04:49.540
- We have five outstanding fugitives,

04:49.540 --> 04:51.803
and we have a week to go.

04:53.210 --> 04:56.030
Frank and Harry, where are we at?

04:56.030 --> 04:58.188
- These boys are incredibly close,

04:58.188 --> 05:01.470
but they are radically
different personalities.

05:01.470 --> 05:03.860
Frank will just want to crack on,

05:03.860 --> 05:05.960
will forge ahead, and we have Harry

05:05.960 --> 05:07.850
who will want to keep things light,

05:07.850 --> 05:09.410
who will want to entertain,

05:09.410 --> 05:12.093
want to keep it relatively easy.

05:12.960 --> 05:14.940
- [Frank] So Harry, if we
win, we win together mate.

05:14.940 --> 05:15.803
- I hope so.

05:17.330 --> 05:19.039
Stinging nettles.

05:19.039 --> 05:19.872
Frank!

05:20.970 --> 05:22.933
I've got his pen knife.

05:22.933 --> 05:24.979
(Harry groaning)

05:24.979 --> 05:27.390
I don't want to sting myself.

05:27.390 --> 05:30.057
(Harry yelling)

05:30.954 --> 05:31.870
- [Frank] You signed up for this.

05:31.870 --> 05:32.703
- Shut up!

05:33.820 --> 05:34.720
You didn't tell me there was a tweezer

05:34.720 --> 05:36.493
in there, I could have done my eyebrows.

05:37.699 --> 05:38.983
May do them tonight.

05:41.310 --> 05:43.810
- [Peter] Ish and Nate, what's the latest?

05:43.810 --> 05:47.240
- Both coming from creative
backgrounds, so architects.

05:47.240 --> 05:48.700
- They're really very clever.

05:48.700 --> 05:50.300
- They were in Huddersfield area.

05:50.300 --> 05:54.070
CCTV got them initially north bound,

05:54.070 --> 05:56.510
and then it went quiet
thereafter, unfortunately.

05:56.510 --> 05:57.680
- [Woman] We ain't got
a clue where they are,

05:57.680 --> 05:58.930
we don't know.

05:58.930 --> 06:00.310
- [Peter] So we need
to try and do something

06:00.310 --> 06:01.722
to change all of that.

06:01.722 --> 06:04.409
- We should have brought a steel drum.

06:04.409 --> 06:06.992
(Nate singing)

06:09.618 --> 06:11.210
- Are you done?

06:11.210 --> 06:12.389
Are you done?

06:12.389 --> 06:14.972
(Nate singing)

06:16.343 --> 06:17.570
(Ish laughing)

06:17.570 --> 06:18.780
Which way are we going, man?

06:18.780 --> 06:19.613
- This way.

06:19.613 --> 06:20.446
- All right, cool.

06:21.280 --> 06:23.130
- [Peter] Where are we at with Loren?

06:23.130 --> 06:24.277
- Loren.

06:24.277 --> 06:25.110
I think it's still possible

06:25.110 --> 06:26.640
that she will contact her mother.

06:26.640 --> 06:28.850
Her mother's ill, and they're in contact

06:28.850 --> 06:30.830
so much, so this is really unusual,

06:30.830 --> 06:32.318
this lack of contact.

06:32.318 --> 06:35.260
I can't believe at some point
they won't come together.

06:35.260 --> 06:36.740
- There was intelligence suggesting

06:36.740 --> 06:38.190
that she's trying to get south,

06:38.190 --> 06:40.030
and she's asking people for a lift,

06:40.030 --> 06:42.030
so something might transpire from that.

06:42.030 --> 06:44.700
- What about social media for Loren?

06:44.700 --> 06:46.650
Can we breathe some life back into that?

06:46.650 --> 06:48.060
Repost pictures.

06:48.060 --> 06:49.860
- Target social media, definitely.

06:49.860 --> 06:51.290
- Right, let's get on with that.

06:51.290 --> 06:52.720
- [Hunter] Yeah.

06:52.720 --> 06:54.450
- [Narrator] By offering a cash reward

06:54.450 --> 06:56.470
across social media, the hunters

06:56.470 --> 06:58.590
hope a member of the
public will tip them off

06:58.590 --> 07:01.410
to Loren's recent whereabouts.

07:01.410 --> 07:02.840
- Loren's bumbling around the country

07:02.840 --> 07:04.300
not really knowing what she's doing.

07:04.300 --> 07:05.870
So lots of people would have seen her

07:05.870 --> 07:07.620
and interacted with her, and if they don't

07:07.620 --> 07:10.320
have any loyalty to Loren,
they might want to help us.

07:12.032 --> 07:14.532
(tense music)

07:17.070 --> 07:20.073
- The mental side of things
is harder than I imagined.

07:21.870 --> 07:25.040
The actual mental side of you don't

07:25.040 --> 07:26.740
actually know where you're
going to the next day,

07:26.740 --> 07:28.740
you don't know where
you're going to end up.

07:28.740 --> 07:31.280
It makes you feel so isolated.

07:31.280 --> 07:34.073
I can imagine how my mom must feel.

07:35.510 --> 07:37.620
- [Narrator] Three days ago, Loren tried

07:37.620 --> 07:40.440
and failed to meet with her family.

07:40.440 --> 07:42.200
It means she's had no contact

07:42.200 --> 07:44.830
with her mother for nearly three weeks.

07:44.830 --> 07:45.920
- My mom's going to find it hard

07:45.920 --> 07:48.139
with me not around, I know she is.

07:48.139 --> 07:49.730
Thank you.

07:49.730 --> 07:51.690
My mom's been suffering with agoraphobia

07:51.690 --> 07:55.200
for 11 years now, long time.

07:55.200 --> 07:56.670
Do I like this?

07:56.670 --> 07:57.503
No!

07:57.503 --> 07:58.930
The longest I've gone without speaking

07:58.930 --> 08:00.203
to my mom is never.

08:01.200 --> 08:03.000
I see my mom every day.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.730
I come home for lunch most days as well,

08:04.730 --> 08:05.980
so we sit there, have lunch together.

08:05.980 --> 08:06.970
Live at your house.

08:06.970 --> 08:08.460
I've never, ever stayed round

08:08.460 --> 08:10.503
anyone else's house, ever.

08:11.736 --> 08:14.750
Agoraphobia, she's
wasting years of her life.

08:14.750 --> 08:17.240
Going out, doing things,
Christmas shopping,

08:17.240 --> 08:19.060
firework night, going out for mother's day

08:19.060 --> 08:20.020
and being treated by your kids,

08:20.020 --> 08:21.320
she don't do none of that.

08:24.269 --> 08:25.473
I just feel bad for her.

08:28.780 --> 08:30.930
I hate leaving her, I feel really guilty.

08:30.930 --> 08:33.609
I know that she's not
really got anyone else.

08:33.609 --> 08:35.170
I just feel for her because
she's such a good person,

08:35.170 --> 08:37.142
and yeah, wish I could help her

08:37.142 --> 08:39.309
and take it away from her.

08:40.880 --> 08:42.090
I know it's a massive risk,

08:42.090 --> 08:44.432
but if I think it's safe
and if it feels right

08:44.432 --> 08:46.902
then I'm going to try and
sneak in and see my mom,

08:46.902 --> 08:48.520
even if it's just for two minutes,

08:48.520 --> 08:51.373
I'll be happy, and then I
can skedaddle and get lost.

08:52.310 --> 08:53.440
Garden center, yay.

08:56.480 --> 09:00.270
Plan for today is get
a lift as far to Essex

09:00.270 --> 09:02.250
as possible, maybe walk some.

09:02.250 --> 09:03.167
Excuse me.

09:03.167 --> 09:04.399
I'm trying to get south.

09:04.399 --> 09:05.232
- South.

09:05.232 --> 09:06.065
- Yeah.

09:06.065 --> 09:07.840
- From here?
- Yeah.

09:07.840 --> 09:09.080
Where's the next little village?

09:09.080 --> 09:12.281
- Up here, a mile and a half, and across.

09:12.281 --> 09:14.880
- Brilliant, thank you.

09:14.880 --> 09:16.875
I'll carry on walking.

09:16.875 --> 09:19.625
(Loren groaning)

09:20.660 --> 09:22.923
I'm too hot for this, too hot.

09:24.027 --> 09:24.860
Too sticky.

09:25.956 --> 09:28.050
I'm having a break.

09:28.050 --> 09:31.580
I started, I was a brand
new BMW tire, right.

09:31.580 --> 09:35.640
I am now literally, I'd get
you pulled if you wore me.

09:35.640 --> 09:37.750
I'm that worn down.

09:37.750 --> 09:40.793
I'm illegal, tire wise.

09:41.940 --> 09:43.000
I hate walking!

09:44.823 --> 09:47.423
All right, let me tuck my
tits in and then we'll go.

09:49.183 --> 09:51.710
(tense music)

09:51.710 --> 09:53.510
- [Zoe] Somebody's just
messaged me, chief.

09:53.510 --> 09:54.343
- [Peter] Oh yeah?

09:54.343 --> 09:55.630
- [Zoe] With information about Loren.

09:55.630 --> 09:57.730
His grandparents had spoken to her.

09:57.730 --> 10:00.390
She had asked them for a lift.

10:00.390 --> 10:01.931
- [Peter] Okay, where's that put her?

10:01.931 --> 10:03.780
- [Zoe] Swarkestone Garden Center.

10:03.780 --> 10:05.260
- Can we pour over that site?

10:05.260 --> 10:08.210
There must be cameras all
over that area in Derby.

10:08.210 --> 10:09.200
Where did she go?

10:09.200 --> 10:10.950
Did she get a lift?

10:10.950 --> 10:14.010
Does she have a destination
that she's aiming for?

10:14.010 --> 10:15.466
- People that she spoke to said

10:15.466 --> 10:18.070
she had an exact destination in mind,

10:18.070 --> 10:19.530
she said she was definitely going south.

10:19.530 --> 10:21.209
Now I don't know where that was to.

10:21.209 --> 10:22.120
- Okay.

10:22.120 --> 10:23.610
- Is that facilitating her move

10:23.610 --> 10:26.070
going back towards the Essex region?

10:26.070 --> 10:26.903
- We shall see.

10:27.832 --> 10:30.332
(tense music)

10:33.180 --> 10:34.097
- Ticknall.

10:35.260 --> 10:39.073
I need somewhere to bed up
for the night round here ASAP.

10:40.183 --> 10:41.016
What's your name?

10:41.016 --> 10:42.010
- [Leon] Leon.

10:42.010 --> 10:44.200
- I need your help, I'm on the run.

10:44.200 --> 10:45.434
Do you know anywhere local,

10:45.434 --> 10:46.750
someone that could put me up?

10:46.750 --> 10:49.313
Let me put my tent in their back garden?

10:52.006 --> 10:53.281
- [Leon] My mum's.

10:53.281 --> 10:54.340
- [Loren] Noway.

10:54.340 --> 10:56.258
- Come out of the pub, left,

10:56.258 --> 10:59.411
there's a T junction, but you'll be going

10:59.411 --> 11:00.900
on the right hand side.

11:00.900 --> 11:02.430
- Thank you so much.
- First left.

11:02.430 --> 11:04.620
- You're an absolute legend, thank you.

11:04.620 --> 11:07.160
Yay! (laughing)

11:07.160 --> 11:08.233
I'm so happy.

11:11.500 --> 11:13.090
Hello. (laughing)

11:13.090 --> 11:14.345
Nice to meet you.

11:14.345 --> 11:15.270
- Sit down.

11:15.270 --> 11:16.180
- Thank you.

11:16.180 --> 11:18.010
- [Narrator] Helped by barman Leon,

11:18.010 --> 11:20.780
Loren's arrived at his
mother, Patricia's house.

11:20.780 --> 11:23.110
- I don't see how they would know

11:23.110 --> 11:26.900
that I was at the pub, and spoke to Leon

11:26.900 --> 11:27.790
and then ended up here.

11:27.790 --> 11:30.128
I just don't see how they'd know.

11:30.128 --> 11:33.240
Thank you. (laughing)

11:33.240 --> 11:34.730
How far is Essex from here?

11:34.730 --> 11:37.830
I want to try and get as
far south as possible,

11:37.830 --> 11:39.491
so it don't matter how long it takes me.

11:39.491 --> 11:40.963
- [Patricia] Essex.

11:40.963 --> 11:42.733
I've got an idea.

11:42.733 --> 11:44.100
Right.

11:44.100 --> 11:45.270
- They're all doing their bit to help me,

11:45.270 --> 11:46.981
which is so lovely.

11:46.981 --> 11:48.750
They're such nice people.

11:48.750 --> 11:51.083
- [Woman] Hugo can take you to Essex.

11:51.083 --> 11:52.910
He's my son's best friend.

11:52.910 --> 11:54.830
- Does he live in Essex?

11:54.830 --> 11:55.663
- [Woman] Yeah.

11:55.663 --> 11:57.390
- If I just organize where to meet Hugo

11:57.390 --> 11:59.648
on Sunday, and I'll just
make sure I'm there.

11:59.648 --> 12:02.723
- [Woman] It will be
Uttoxeter, is that okay?

12:02.723 --> 12:04.171
- Yeah that's fine.

12:04.171 --> 12:05.004
It's the first time I've ever really

12:05.004 --> 12:06.450
had a plan set in stone actually,

12:06.450 --> 12:08.100
it's weird but it's nice.

12:08.100 --> 12:10.690
Sunday I'll be in Essex.

12:10.690 --> 12:12.656
I can run and see my mom.

12:12.656 --> 12:13.728
(Loren gasping)

12:13.728 --> 12:14.686
That's perfect.
- If you get caught,

12:14.686 --> 12:16.240
girl, that's it.

12:16.240 --> 12:18.820
- Yeah, no I can't, I can't
get that far and get caught.

12:18.820 --> 12:21.413
That would be so gutting, wouldn't it?

12:22.434 --> 12:24.934
(tense music)

12:32.702 --> 12:34.702
- [Nate] I can get up there.

12:34.702 --> 12:36.285
I can get up there.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.880
- [Narrator] Best friends Nate and Ish

12:39.880 --> 12:41.450
have been living off grid.

12:41.450 --> 12:43.160
- I cannot tell you the
last time I did that.

12:43.160 --> 12:45.300
- Nate's decided they should camp

12:45.300 --> 12:47.796
to keep the hunters off their trail.

12:47.796 --> 12:49.670
(Ish laughing)

12:49.670 --> 12:50.700
- [Nate] Style it out.

12:50.700 --> 12:53.380
- Anybody who knows me, or
anybody who knows Nathan

12:53.380 --> 12:55.600
will know he's like my brother.

12:55.600 --> 12:58.520
- Nate and Ish, Nish.

12:58.520 --> 13:00.380
- [Ish] It sounds like we're
in a relationship. (laughing)

13:00.380 --> 13:01.810
- [Nate] No we are not a couple.

13:01.810 --> 13:02.915
- Yeah, we're not a couple.

13:02.915 --> 13:03.748
(Nate laughing)

13:03.748 --> 13:04.833
- Give me your hand.

13:05.822 --> 13:08.300
I'm not going without you.

13:08.300 --> 13:10.313
- Going on the run with
somebody like Nate,

13:10.313 --> 13:12.180
it's going to help me out a lot,

13:12.180 --> 13:14.437
because I'm a bit of an introvert.

13:15.970 --> 13:19.490
One thing that does affect
me is my self belief.

13:19.490 --> 13:21.390
I had a pretty tough time at school.

13:21.390 --> 13:23.962
I was short, chubby with the Afro,

13:23.962 --> 13:26.832
and I was bullied for about two years.

13:26.832 --> 13:28.969
I would be lying if I said it still

13:28.969 --> 13:30.850
doesn't affect me now.

13:30.850 --> 13:34.709
It is what has made me
develop this social anxiety.

13:34.709 --> 13:36.170
I'm going to have to figure out

13:36.170 --> 13:37.313
which way I'm getting down.

13:37.313 --> 13:38.613
- [Nate] Go down that way.

13:41.393 --> 13:43.838
(banging)

13:43.838 --> 13:46.060
(Nate laughing)

13:46.060 --> 13:47.288
- Oh man!

13:47.288 --> 13:48.950
(Nate laughing)

13:48.950 --> 13:50.580
Straight on my bum.

13:50.580 --> 13:52.220
Nathan is very confident.

13:52.220 --> 13:53.490
His charisma's definitely an asset,

13:53.490 --> 13:55.330
and I will let him take the lead,

13:55.330 --> 13:57.630
because I know he's
probably better than I am.

13:59.367 --> 14:02.070
(gentle upbeat music)

14:02.070 --> 14:04.540
I think our personalities
together are perfect.

14:04.540 --> 14:06.661
We both just work together.

14:06.661 --> 14:09.161
(tense music)

14:11.130 --> 14:14.220
- Looking at Nate and Ish, Nate is a bit

14:14.220 --> 14:16.400
more gregarious, he's
a bit more out there.

14:16.400 --> 14:18.733
He likes socializing, he likes attention.

14:18.733 --> 14:21.030
- He has thousands and
thousands of followers,

14:21.030 --> 14:23.270
almost a man club of people.

14:23.270 --> 14:24.400
Posts a lot of content.

14:24.400 --> 14:26.400
Clearly has people all over the country

14:26.400 --> 14:28.280
just admiring him and talking to him.

14:28.280 --> 14:29.910
Ish is a little more reserved,

14:29.910 --> 14:31.690
not quite as much presence,

14:31.690 --> 14:34.170
but the two of them, they're
really, really close,

14:34.170 --> 14:36.810
from what I can see on
the social media here.

14:36.810 --> 14:38.030
- What we're struggling to find out

14:38.030 --> 14:40.270
is what role Ish is playing in all this.

14:40.270 --> 14:42.410
We don't know what makes him tick.

14:42.410 --> 14:46.310
It seems Ish is a good
Muslim family member,

14:46.310 --> 14:48.440
so as long as we're
monitoring all of them,

14:48.440 --> 14:50.130
we might just come across Ish

14:50.130 --> 14:51.980
reaching out to some of these people.

14:54.850 --> 14:57.208
- [Narrator] To bolster
their intel on Ish.

14:57.208 --> 14:58.041
- [Hafsa] Hello?

14:58.041 --> 14:59.660
- [Narrator] Ground hunters
have been dispatched

14:59.660 --> 15:01.960
to interrogate his sister, Hafsa.

15:01.960 --> 15:04.850
- [Hunter] How're you
coping with him being away?

15:04.850 --> 15:05.850
- Terrible.

15:05.850 --> 15:07.280
I just wanna hear his voice,

15:07.280 --> 15:09.240
just to see he's okay.

15:09.240 --> 15:10.850
He's the baby brother.

15:10.850 --> 15:13.590
We've always been the closer siblings.

15:13.590 --> 15:14.970
- [Hunter] And you've
not spoken to him since?

15:14.970 --> 15:15.803
- No.

15:17.370 --> 15:19.740
- So what would happen
if they rang you up today

15:19.740 --> 15:21.533
and asked you to help them out?

15:22.940 --> 15:25.077
- It depends what they want.

15:25.077 --> 15:27.898
A big sister always has to help.

15:27.898 --> 15:30.398
(tense music)

15:35.962 --> 15:37.870
- I really didn't enjoy last night.

15:37.870 --> 15:39.870
I had three separate dreams,

15:39.870 --> 15:43.310
and one of them was so, so vivid, man.

15:43.310 --> 15:45.650
- [Nate] To do with here or
just to do with back home?

15:45.650 --> 15:47.951
- To do with people back home.

15:47.951 --> 15:48.784
It was not good.

15:49.649 --> 15:51.570
It was not good at all.

15:51.570 --> 15:52.403
It was grim.

15:53.920 --> 15:56.320
- [Narrator] After nearly
three weeks on the run,

15:56.320 --> 16:00.230
life as a fugitive is
taking its toll on Ish.

16:00.230 --> 16:01.741
- I mean even though it was a dream,

16:01.741 --> 16:03.490
it's really not nice to see a member

16:03.490 --> 16:05.023
of your family passing.

16:06.960 --> 16:08.680
Definitely consider just ringing

16:08.680 --> 16:11.653
and making sure that that person is okay.

16:12.510 --> 16:14.901
- Yeah, I can't even consider it.

16:14.901 --> 16:17.600
Not even a consideration.

16:17.600 --> 16:19.200
Ish is worried about his family.

16:20.118 --> 16:23.212
I think he wants to go and see them.

16:23.212 --> 16:26.623
To go and try to see people
that are known to us,

16:29.440 --> 16:30.433
it's like suicide.

16:31.833 --> 16:34.632
(Ish crying)

16:34.632 --> 16:37.132
(tense music)

16:40.864 --> 16:42.547
- Don't think anyone's following us.

16:42.547 --> 16:44.130
- [Patricia] No I don't
think anyone's following us.

16:44.130 --> 16:46.640
- [Narrator] Fugitive
Loren is being dropped

16:46.640 --> 16:49.190
as a pre-arranged location in Uttoxeter.

16:49.190 --> 16:50.789
- There's the Water Bridge.

16:50.789 --> 16:51.970
- Okay, yeah.

16:51.970 --> 16:53.380
- [Narrator] Where she'll meet Hugo,

16:53.380 --> 16:55.660
who will drive her home.

16:55.660 --> 16:58.223
- I want to come with ya.

16:58.223 --> 16:59.056
- Bye!

17:00.492 --> 17:02.590
I just want to get home.

17:02.590 --> 17:05.040
Even though it's a massive risk.

17:05.040 --> 17:07.130
I've got half of me that's like ah,

17:07.130 --> 17:09.970
thinking all the bad stuff,
but then I'm like yay,

17:09.970 --> 17:11.713
you're going to get to see your mom soon.

17:14.940 --> 17:17.996
- [Hunter] Guys, positive
sighting of Loren, CCTV.

17:17.996 --> 17:19.560
- [Ben] Yes.

17:19.560 --> 17:21.510
- [Narrator] Following a
tip off from the public,

17:21.510 --> 17:25.330
HQ have been analyzing
CCTV of Loren's movements

17:25.330 --> 17:26.490
around rural Derbyshire.

17:26.490 --> 17:28.780
- She's getting off.

17:28.780 --> 17:30.187
- [Ben] She got off at Ticknall.

17:30.187 --> 17:31.570
- [Peter] Ticknall then.

17:31.570 --> 17:32.700
- [Zoe] Doesn't look to be much there.

17:32.700 --> 17:35.893
There's a farm and a bed and breakfast.

17:37.080 --> 17:38.140
- We've got an exact region

17:38.140 --> 17:39.954
where she potentially bedded down.

17:39.954 --> 17:42.834
We're slowly piecing it together.

17:42.834 --> 17:45.090
- Right I found CCTV in Ticknall.

17:45.090 --> 17:47.182
Guys, sighting of Loren again.

17:47.182 --> 17:48.741
- Yes!

17:48.741 --> 17:50.120
Excellent.

17:50.120 --> 17:52.616
- [Hunter] Inside the
pub The Staff of Life.

17:52.616 --> 17:53.980
Looks like she's talking to someone.

17:53.980 --> 17:56.200
- No mucking about here.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.170
- [Zoe] Getting closer.

17:57.170 --> 17:58.020
- There she goes.

18:01.020 --> 18:05.980
- Sighting of Loren inside a
pub called The Staff of Life.

18:05.980 --> 18:08.890
She's seen sitting down at
a table talking to someone.

18:08.890 --> 18:11.563
Go and weave your magic
in The Staff of Life.

18:11.563 --> 18:12.396
Thank you fellas.

18:12.396 --> 18:13.965
- No worries, mate.

18:13.965 --> 18:16.068
(tense music)

18:16.068 --> 18:18.183
- Come on, this is working, I love it.

18:23.060 --> 18:24.370
- [Steve] We're looking for a girl

18:24.370 --> 18:26.740
in this pub on Wednesday.

18:26.740 --> 18:29.120
We just want to know
if anybody's seen her.

18:29.120 --> 18:30.120
- [Landlady] Lewis might remember.

18:30.120 --> 18:31.722
- [George] Okay.

18:31.722 --> 18:32.650
Lewis?

18:32.650 --> 18:35.450
Let me show you this, see if
you recognize that person.

18:35.450 --> 18:37.670
- She just wanted to
know if she could stay,

18:37.670 --> 18:39.340
or where she can hide.

18:39.340 --> 18:41.370
- When she left the pub,
which way did she go?

18:41.370 --> 18:42.277
- [Lewis] She went that way.

18:42.277 --> 18:43.730
- She went back that way?

18:43.730 --> 18:45.280
- [George] Did you see her meet anybody?

18:45.280 --> 18:48.237
- Another member of staff
called for a lift for her,

18:48.237 --> 18:49.510
but he's not here today,
it's his day off today.

18:49.510 --> 18:50.820
- What's your friend's name?

18:50.820 --> 18:51.653
- Leon.

18:51.653 --> 18:52.486
- [George] Who did he call?

18:52.486 --> 18:53.607
- I don't know.

18:53.607 --> 18:56.142
(tense music)

18:56.142 --> 18:57.318
- Hi, it's the chief.

18:57.318 --> 18:59.837
- [Steve] Yeah mate, we think
the barman Leon's involved.

18:59.837 --> 19:00.670
- Yep.

19:00.670 --> 19:01.503
- [Steve] He's not at the pub,

19:01.503 --> 19:02.660
so can you confirm his address?

19:02.660 --> 19:04.364
Because we want to talk to him.

19:04.364 --> 19:06.660
- Leon's address is Clayfield Road.

19:06.660 --> 19:10.710
- The given address for
Leon Smith, Clayfield Road.

19:10.710 --> 19:14.300
Leon's mother Patricia
is also at that address.

19:14.300 --> 19:16.265
Rinse him for everything he's got.

19:16.265 --> 19:17.450
- [Steve] Roger.

19:17.450 --> 19:19.950
(tense music)

19:20.914 --> 19:21.749
(knocking)

19:21.749 --> 19:23.240
- [Patricia] Oh hi.

19:23.240 --> 19:24.088
- Where's Leon?

19:24.088 --> 19:25.561
- Where's daddy?

19:25.561 --> 19:26.394
Where's daddy?

19:26.394 --> 19:28.020
- Nowhere.

19:28.020 --> 19:29.886
- Is that your mobile in there?

19:29.886 --> 19:31.030
- [Patricia] Yeah.

19:31.030 --> 19:32.138
- I need to look at it.

19:32.138 --> 19:33.210
- [Patricia] You do?

19:33.210 --> 19:34.043
- Yeah.

19:36.950 --> 19:38.483
- [Patricia] But why have you come here?

19:38.483 --> 19:40.638
- [George] Leon was
helping out a fugitive.

19:40.638 --> 19:41.707
- [Patricia] Right.

19:41.707 --> 19:43.892
- And so what was your involvement in it?

19:43.892 --> 19:45.692
- Do you know, I've got memory loss.

19:47.654 --> 19:49.304
- [Steve] She stayed here, right?

19:50.331 --> 19:52.023
- I don't have to tell you anything,

19:53.200 --> 19:54.630
and if I tell you something,

19:54.630 --> 19:55.866
could it be the truth?

19:55.866 --> 19:57.546
That's for you to decide.

19:57.546 --> 19:59.650
- And if you don't start playing ball,

19:59.650 --> 20:00.950
I'm just going to take it.

20:04.142 --> 20:05.033
(Patricia laughing)

20:05.033 --> 20:07.700
- Honest to God, this is
nervous laughing. (laughing)

20:07.700 --> 20:09.243
- [Steve] What are you nervous about?

20:10.710 --> 20:11.543
- Nothing.

20:12.540 --> 20:13.373
- [Hunter] Hello Steve?

20:13.373 --> 20:15.308
- [Steve] Leon isn't here,
but his mom Patricia is.

20:15.308 --> 20:17.037
I've got her phone, I'm
going through it now.

20:17.037 --> 20:18.560
- If you can screenshot everything

20:18.560 --> 20:19.913
and send it through to us.

20:24.210 --> 20:25.500
Right.

20:25.500 --> 20:28.170
Yeah boss look, Steve's
just feeding this through.

20:28.170 --> 20:29.920
- [Narrator] Call history
on Patricia's phone

20:29.920 --> 20:32.800
reveals multiple calls
to an unsaved number.

20:32.800 --> 20:36.450
- The unknown mobile number
comes back to Hugo Simmonds.

20:36.450 --> 20:37.770
22 years old.

20:37.770 --> 20:39.230
He's showing as living in London,

20:39.230 --> 20:41.800
but all of his contacts are in Uttoxeter.

20:41.800 --> 20:43.390
He must be the next link.

20:43.390 --> 20:45.000
- Let's get all over it.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.320
- [Narrator] With remote
access to Patricia's phone,

20:47.320 --> 20:50.460
HQ are going through all deleted messages.

20:50.460 --> 20:53.157
- Oh wait shit, Hugo's
driving her to Essex!

20:54.593 --> 20:57.070
- This says Hugo can only give her a lift

20:57.070 --> 21:00.890
from Uttoxeter to Essex, two
PM Sunday at Water Bridge.

21:00.890 --> 21:01.723
- [Hunter] So it's tomorrow.

21:01.723 --> 21:02.690
- Tomorrow.
- Yeah.

21:02.690 --> 21:03.523
- [Ben] Yes!

21:03.523 --> 21:05.254
- [Peter] Let's get Hugo on
live intercept now please.

21:05.254 --> 21:06.270
- Yes chief.

21:06.270 --> 21:07.830
- Get us the details, get us a map,

21:07.830 --> 21:10.550
we'll get ground hunters there tonight.

21:10.550 --> 21:12.140
- We've just had some phone work back,

21:12.140 --> 21:14.493
Hugo will pick her up tomorrow, two PM.

21:14.493 --> 21:16.700
You can do the catch at Water Bridge.

21:16.700 --> 21:17.919
- Game on!

21:17.919 --> 21:19.336
- Right let's go.

21:20.319 --> 21:22.219
- We've got three ground hunter teams

21:22.219 --> 21:24.040
that are going to be within that area.

21:24.040 --> 21:25.730
- This is great, we can fucking spread

21:25.730 --> 21:26.738
resources out, sorry for my language,

21:26.738 --> 21:27.970
I'm a bit excited.

21:27.970 --> 21:28.938
Spread resources out tomorrow,

21:28.938 --> 21:30.980
pick Loren up and smash it.

21:30.980 --> 21:34.918
- [Hunter] Let's catch
ourself a fugitive. (laughing)

21:34.918 --> 21:37.350
- Looking forward to seeing my mom.

21:37.350 --> 21:39.460
I'm getting well nervous.

21:39.460 --> 21:41.424
She's going to be so happy to see me,

21:41.424 --> 21:42.810
but she's going to be so angry,

21:42.810 --> 21:43.870
because she said to me, she said

21:43.870 --> 21:45.920
no matter what, no matter
how home sick you get,

21:45.920 --> 21:48.460
no matter how sad you
feel, do not come home

21:48.460 --> 21:50.477
or get in contact with home at all.

21:51.451 --> 21:53.951
(tense music)

22:08.953 --> 22:11.703
(Loren groaning)

22:15.910 --> 22:17.340
Morning!

22:17.340 --> 22:18.872
- [Narrator] Concerned about her mom,

22:18.872 --> 22:22.140
Loren's arranged a lift
home to check she's okay,

22:22.140 --> 22:25.390
and is meeting her driver Hugo today.

22:25.390 --> 22:26.590
- [Loren] I miss my bed.

22:29.460 --> 22:30.943
I'm fucking shitting myself.

22:32.007 --> 22:34.503
This is the most scared I've ever felt.

22:36.490 --> 22:38.643
I really hope I'm not
about to go get caught.

22:40.646 --> 22:43.146
(tense music)

22:45.972 --> 22:49.330
- Right guys, Loren's meet
is going to happen today,

22:49.330 --> 22:50.803
around the time of two PM.

22:52.010 --> 22:54.130
- [Narrator] Having
discovered Loren's plan,

22:54.130 --> 22:55.590
ground hunters have been deployed

22:55.590 --> 22:57.640
to the Uttoxeter services, where the meet

22:57.640 --> 23:00.118
with Hugo will take place.

23:00.118 --> 23:03.700
- We've got George in a
surveillance vehicle here.

23:03.700 --> 23:06.510
Steve is covertly in this area here.

23:06.510 --> 23:08.273
- Radio two, over.

23:08.273 --> 23:10.530
- Jill and Paul in a surveillance car.

23:10.530 --> 23:12.834
- Steve, just for info, you're R5 to me.

23:12.834 --> 23:15.320
- Claire and Nick in a surveillance car.

23:15.320 --> 23:17.010
- So if she isn't in Uttoxeter,

23:17.010 --> 23:18.770
and she gets to Essex some other way,

23:18.770 --> 23:20.200
Dan and Jordan will cover the mic one,

23:20.200 --> 23:23.120
and marker car can cover the Essex region.

23:23.120 --> 23:24.219
- That's the plan.

23:24.219 --> 23:25.052
- I don't think we could have put

23:25.052 --> 23:25.885
more resources in there.

23:25.885 --> 23:26.900
- No, I don't think we can.

23:26.900 --> 23:28.610
- The board is set.

23:28.610 --> 23:29.823
The pieces are moving.

23:33.490 --> 23:35.552
- I feel more stressed because
I don't want to get caught.

23:35.552 --> 23:37.760
I don't know whether to use Hugo or not.

23:37.760 --> 23:39.110
They could be watching him.

23:40.495 --> 23:42.193
I feel a bit more paranoid.

23:44.103 --> 23:46.033
Right, say they know that I'm getting

23:46.033 --> 23:48.140
this lift, they're going
to be hovering around

23:48.140 --> 23:49.090
over there waiting.

23:50.967 --> 23:52.430
So their attention is on that,

23:52.430 --> 23:54.290
rather than on where I am now.

23:54.290 --> 23:55.600
If they don't have a clue where I am

23:55.600 --> 23:57.303
and they're actually looking for me.

24:01.057 --> 24:05.636
I don't know what to do,
because I really want this lift.

24:05.636 --> 24:07.250
I don't fucking know!

24:07.250 --> 24:09.073
I wish I knew what they were thinking.

24:10.220 --> 24:12.764
(tense music)

24:12.764 --> 24:14.248
- Eyes on.

24:14.248 --> 24:16.048
- There's a car, stand by, stand by.

24:17.400 --> 24:18.233
- [Paul] Hugo's car.

24:18.233 --> 24:20.100
- We're on, we're on.

24:20.100 --> 24:21.270
Yeah, received.

24:21.270 --> 24:23.300
- [Claire] He's parking
next to Jill and Paul.

24:23.300 --> 24:24.133
- Shit!

24:24.133 --> 24:26.268
- [Jill] He's literally
pulling in next to us.

24:26.268 --> 24:27.279
- [Ben] Roger that.

24:27.279 --> 24:28.277
- [Jill] Fuck!

24:28.277 --> 24:31.234
If he looks in the window, we are fucked.

24:31.234 --> 24:33.090
- Yeah, roger that.

24:33.090 --> 24:35.340
- [Jill] He's got no idea that we're here.

24:35.340 --> 24:37.773
- [Hunter] It's two o'clock,
meet time should be now.

24:37.773 --> 24:39.367
- [Jill] Male believed to be Hugo

24:39.367 --> 24:40.670
appears to be texting.

24:40.670 --> 24:42.560
I don't know whether you can see him.

24:42.560 --> 24:45.107
- [Hunter] Oh yeah, I can
see him, yeah, received.

24:45.107 --> 24:46.463
- They're so close.

24:47.670 --> 24:49.970
- Come on Loren, where the fuck are you?

24:50.809 --> 24:53.309
(tense music)

24:54.880 --> 24:57.017
- Just hold your nerve
and keep where you are.

25:01.780 --> 25:03.200
- If they've clocked on to anything,

25:03.200 --> 25:04.623
they've clocked on to Hugo.

25:06.078 --> 25:08.037
Because the hunters could potentially

25:08.037 --> 25:10.600
get a lead on Hugo,
whereas I was with Trish,

25:10.600 --> 25:12.520
and if they start to make a trail on me,

25:12.520 --> 25:14.338
I don't want to use someone
that's already got a link,

25:14.338 --> 25:18.950
so new plan, going to
head to service station,

25:18.950 --> 25:21.120
blag a lift further south.

25:21.120 --> 25:22.263
I'm on the run, is there anyway

25:22.263 --> 25:23.980
I can borrow your phone quickly

25:23.980 --> 25:25.780
just to ring this number, thank you.

25:28.377 --> 25:29.210
- [Kier] Hello?

25:29.210 --> 25:30.635
- Hello Kier, it's Loren.

25:30.635 --> 25:31.706
- You all right?

25:31.706 --> 25:32.539
- Hello!

25:32.539 --> 25:35.160
Right Kieran, I need
a massive favor, yeah?

25:35.160 --> 25:35.993
- Go on.
- Can you get

25:35.993 --> 25:37.900
somebody to come and get me?

25:37.900 --> 25:39.210
- [Kieran] I can get ya.

25:39.210 --> 25:41.010
- All right, just come, let's do it.

25:42.060 --> 25:44.300
- [Narrator] Loren's called
her best friend's boyfriend

25:44.300 --> 25:47.910
Kieran Ferguson for a
lift home to see her mom.

25:47.910 --> 25:48.802
- All right, bye bye.

25:48.802 --> 25:49.635
- [Kieran] Bye bye.

25:49.635 --> 25:52.012
- Right now we need to go hide.

25:52.012 --> 25:53.663
Where the fuck do I hide?

25:55.396 --> 25:58.440
(tense music)

25:58.440 --> 26:01.139
- [Jill] Come on Loren, out you come.

26:01.139 --> 26:02.972
- [Paul] Where is she?

26:06.200 --> 26:07.630
- 25 minutes late.

26:07.630 --> 26:09.260
- Well late according to what we know.

26:09.260 --> 26:10.093
- Big long waiting game, init?

26:10.093 --> 26:12.233
I don't know what else we can do.

26:13.987 --> 26:15.530
We've got teams held in Uttoxeter,

26:15.530 --> 26:17.280
we've got Dan and Jordan holding

26:17.280 --> 26:20.600
the M1 south, and we've
got Mark and Carl in Essex.

26:20.600 --> 26:21.900
- [Ben] Got that whole corridor covered

26:21.900 --> 26:23.904
if the move is to go home.

26:23.904 --> 26:25.310
(Ben sighing)

26:25.310 --> 26:26.360
Do you still think this is on?

26:26.360 --> 26:27.530
- I do.

26:27.530 --> 26:28.743
- [Ben] I hope you're right.

26:29.865 --> 26:32.365
(tense music)

26:36.880 --> 26:38.110
- We need somebodies phone to make

26:38.110 --> 26:39.443
a phone call to Jobe.

26:40.520 --> 26:42.020
- Ish is struggling quite a bit.

26:42.020 --> 26:43.920
I'm worried that he might not make it.

26:45.070 --> 26:46.780
So yeah, I'm going to do whatever

26:46.780 --> 26:49.330
it takes to help him get through this.

26:49.330 --> 26:50.700
- [Narrator] Nate's devised a plan

26:50.700 --> 26:53.150
whereby Ish can meet his sister.

26:53.150 --> 26:55.180
- I appreciate what you're doing Nate.

26:55.180 --> 26:56.893
- The boost that would give you

26:56.893 --> 27:00.057
for the final few days, you don't know

27:00.057 --> 27:02.860
how much of a power up that could be.

27:02.860 --> 27:04.590
- [Narrator] The boys
are using their network

27:04.590 --> 27:07.410
of friends to execute the plan.

27:07.410 --> 27:08.380
- Jobe, hello?

27:08.380 --> 27:11.583
We'll be at Gledhow Park Drive.

27:13.340 --> 27:16.450
What we'll do is by using my Instagram

27:16.450 --> 27:20.440
live stream, I'll be able to
draw the hunters to Nottingham.

27:20.440 --> 27:22.340
I'll be taking some of
the heat off of you.

27:22.340 --> 27:26.057
That could give you
some time to meet Hafsa

27:26.057 --> 27:28.710
and meet back up with me afterwards.

27:28.710 --> 27:29.940
It's pretty risky.

27:29.940 --> 27:31.492
He's like my brother.

27:31.492 --> 27:33.100
We started this together, and we're going

27:33.100 --> 27:34.050
to end it together.

27:35.220 --> 27:36.880
- [Narrator] Nate plans
to lure the hunters

27:36.880 --> 27:39.100
to Nottingham, allowing Ish time

27:39.100 --> 27:41.770
to meet his sister in neighboring Derby.

27:41.770 --> 27:45.173
They hope to reunite in
Dudley, in the West Midlands.

27:47.850 --> 27:49.520
(car horn honking)

27:49.520 --> 27:50.353
- He's here.

27:51.420 --> 27:52.880
Oh my days!

27:52.880 --> 27:53.970
Aw!

27:53.970 --> 27:56.300
- [Narrator] Associate
Jobe will drive the boys

27:56.300 --> 27:59.663
to meet with friends, who will
help implement their ruse.

28:00.938 --> 28:03.438
(tense music)

28:07.148 --> 28:08.640
- What's going on lads?

28:08.640 --> 28:10.121
- Oh my!
- Legend.

28:10.121 --> 28:11.150
- Is Hafsa a go?

28:11.150 --> 28:11.983
- [Man] Hafsa's a go.

28:11.983 --> 28:12.816
- Nice, oh thank you!

28:12.816 --> 28:13.916
- [Man] Amazing point.

28:15.378 --> 28:17.090
- Bro.

28:17.090 --> 28:18.913
I'll see you in Dudley, yeah?

28:20.770 --> 28:22.070
All right.

28:22.070 --> 28:23.579
- See you in a bit.

28:23.579 --> 28:26.079
(tense music)

28:27.490 --> 28:29.350
You guys are just amazing.

28:30.945 --> 28:32.570
- Put your head down because there's CCTV

28:32.570 --> 28:34.580
all over the place, mate.

28:34.580 --> 28:36.230
- [Narrator] The boys flatmate Drew

28:36.230 --> 28:38.860
will pose as Ish during the broadcast,

28:38.860 --> 28:41.680
with another friend filming on his phone.

28:41.680 --> 28:42.773
- Keep your head down, Drew,

28:42.773 --> 28:44.133
keep your head down.

28:44.133 --> 28:46.223
Just logged into my Instagram.

28:49.138 --> 28:50.640
- [Man] Are you nervous about this?

28:50.640 --> 28:51.473
- Yeah.

28:55.790 --> 28:57.320
- Get it ready.

28:57.320 --> 28:58.383
Right, you ready?

29:00.062 --> 29:01.535
We're back in Nottingham.

29:01.535 --> 29:04.030
Just walking through
town like it's nothing.

29:04.030 --> 29:06.178
I haven't seen a peep, but apparently

29:06.178 --> 29:07.761
we're being hunted.

29:09.101 --> 29:11.477
Ish, do you feel like you're being hunted?

29:11.477 --> 29:12.450
- This is live.

29:12.450 --> 29:13.283
Guys!

29:15.100 --> 29:17.114
Nate's live on Instagram.

29:17.114 --> 29:18.103
- Live?

29:20.219 --> 29:22.083
- [Hunter] They're putting
on some kind of display.

29:23.090 --> 29:24.734
- Are we breaking the hunters?

29:24.734 --> 29:25.582
- We're breaking them, mate.

29:25.582 --> 29:26.415
- Are we breaking the hunters?

29:26.415 --> 29:27.466
- We're breaking them.

29:27.466 --> 29:30.135
(Nate laughing)

29:30.135 --> 29:31.751
- They're right in the
middle of Nottingham,

29:31.751 --> 29:32.584
there's that fountain.

29:32.584 --> 29:33.417
- Yeah it is.

29:33.417 --> 29:34.850
- Yeah, that's that one.

29:34.850 --> 29:36.580
- Just as a tactical point of view,

29:36.580 --> 29:37.680
we're not going to play around

29:37.680 --> 29:39.250
with these dickheads, we're going

29:39.250 --> 29:42.270
to stick to the plan,
get Loren in the bag.

29:42.270 --> 29:43.490
If we start spreading, we're not

29:43.490 --> 29:45.907
going to get Loren, but
we'll across it technically.

29:45.907 --> 29:46.897
- I agree.

29:46.897 --> 29:48.928
- We've got a capture going on potentially

29:48.928 --> 29:52.160
on Loren, a live lead on Ish and Nate,

29:52.160 --> 29:53.806
not enough people to do what we've got

29:53.806 --> 29:56.473
coming in, but we'll do
the best we possibly can.

30:00.901 --> 30:02.580
- All right then, you ready?

30:03.443 --> 30:04.526
Nearly there.

30:06.874 --> 30:08.550
Please be here, please be here.

30:08.550 --> 30:10.040
- [Narrator] Ish has arrived at the park

30:10.040 --> 30:12.630
in Derby to meet his sister.

30:12.630 --> 30:13.952
- Oh my days!

30:13.952 --> 30:16.925
(gentle music)

30:16.925 --> 30:18.164
(Ish laughing)

30:18.164 --> 30:19.414
- Are you okay?

30:20.570 --> 30:21.403
Are you all right?

30:21.403 --> 30:22.236
- Oh my days, Hafsa.

30:22.236 --> 30:23.069
Where are the twins?

30:23.069 --> 30:23.902
Did they not come with you?

30:23.902 --> 30:24.735
- No, no, no.

30:24.735 --> 30:27.212
- Oh no seriously, I wanted to see them.

30:27.212 --> 30:28.045
- Are you okay?
- Let's get out of here

30:28.045 --> 30:29.728
before people start seeing, yeah.

30:29.728 --> 30:31.380
I just had to see you.

30:31.380 --> 30:32.530
I don't get to see anyone,

30:32.530 --> 30:34.936
you don't hear about anything.

30:34.936 --> 30:36.780
Listen man, honestly.

30:36.780 --> 30:37.613
Is mom okay and everyone at home?

30:37.613 --> 30:38.707
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, they're fine,

30:38.707 --> 30:39.760
they're perfect.
- I had this really

30:39.760 --> 30:42.013
horrible dream a while ago.

30:42.013 --> 30:45.063
It was horrible, but I've
never felt so horrible.

30:46.384 --> 30:48.884
(Ish sighing)

30:50.830 --> 30:52.458
What a meet.
- Oh my gosh!

30:52.458 --> 30:54.155
(Kafsa laughing)

30:54.155 --> 30:55.680
- I should probably get going.

30:55.680 --> 30:56.674
- Yeah.

30:56.674 --> 30:57.800
Right.

30:57.800 --> 30:58.750
- [Ish] Don't want them storming here.

30:58.750 --> 30:59.583
- Okay then.

30:59.583 --> 31:00.883
I really missed you.

31:01.819 --> 31:03.358
- Say hi to the twins for me.

31:03.358 --> 31:04.508
Tell them I'm all fine.

31:05.400 --> 31:06.233
Drive safely.

31:08.218 --> 31:10.053
It was great seeing her.

31:10.053 --> 31:14.044
It's so reassuring to
know everyone's okay.

31:14.044 --> 31:14.995
Oh geez.

31:14.995 --> 31:15.828
- You all right?

31:15.828 --> 31:19.230
- Yeah, yeah. (sighs)

31:19.230 --> 31:23.599
All I need now, I just need
to know that Nathan's okay.

31:23.599 --> 31:26.099
(tense music)

31:31.376 --> 31:34.211
- He's driving round really slowly.

31:34.211 --> 31:36.520
He's looking around a lot.

31:36.520 --> 31:38.010
- [Hunter] He's just
looking for her, isn't he?

31:38.010 --> 31:39.723
- [Woman] He's looking for her, yeah.

31:42.080 --> 31:43.850
- [Paul] Fuck sake, where are you?

31:43.850 --> 31:45.423
- [Hunter] I recon he's going
to fuck off in a minute.

31:45.423 --> 31:46.600
- [Woman] He's revving
his engine a little bit

31:46.600 --> 31:48.310
more than he was the
last time he went round.

31:48.310 --> 31:49.885
- [Hunter] He's getting
the hump, isn't he?

31:49.885 --> 31:50.900
- Yeah, he's getting fed up.

31:50.900 --> 31:52.156
- [Man] Is he leaving?

31:52.156 --> 31:54.394
- [Woman] He's off, off, off.

31:54.394 --> 31:55.877
(dramatic music)

31:55.877 --> 31:56.710
- Fuck!

31:57.613 --> 31:58.946
- For fuck sake!

32:00.010 --> 32:01.410
- [Ben] She's not turned up.

32:02.266 --> 32:04.681
(Ben sighing)

32:04.681 --> 32:07.240
- It's not really going to plan, is it?

32:07.240 --> 32:09.440
- [Ben] Right, we know that
the move is to go home,

32:09.440 --> 32:12.943
it's just who is she with,
and how is she getting home?

32:12.943 --> 32:14.890
- Right, we've got to get across

32:14.890 --> 32:17.100
Loren's associates that we strongly

32:17.100 --> 32:19.030
suspect will be involved.

32:19.030 --> 32:20.863
That's mission critical, isn't it?

32:23.026 --> 32:24.827
- What this means, I don't know.

32:24.827 --> 32:27.360
The Uttoxeter angle now is a dead end.

32:27.360 --> 32:29.283
Has she transited to another area

32:29.283 --> 32:32.150
in the hope to get down towards Essex?

32:32.150 --> 32:35.133
Nothing's quite clear
as to what is going on.

32:35.133 --> 32:38.282
- Some activity on
Kieran Ferguson's phone.

32:38.282 --> 32:40.640
- [Hunter] That's her best
friend's boyfriend Kieran.

32:40.640 --> 32:43.820
- So incoming to Ferguson's handset?

32:43.820 --> 32:45.900
- [Hunter] From a number that
looks like it's unknown to us.

32:45.900 --> 32:47.520
Can we get the location?

32:47.520 --> 32:48.520
- [Woman] Leicester.

32:49.736 --> 32:51.186
- [Hunter] Why would that be?

32:52.599 --> 32:54.010
- Is this now what we're seeing?

32:54.010 --> 32:56.500
The plan has changed and
this isn't Hugo involved.

32:56.500 --> 32:58.110
She's just rung into Kieran.

32:58.110 --> 32:59.533
- That could be significant.

33:00.640 --> 33:02.700
Let's get all over that phone urgently.

33:02.700 --> 33:03.533
- Yes chief.

33:05.520 --> 33:07.560
- He should be here soon.

33:07.560 --> 33:08.929
I just want him to hurry up now,

33:08.929 --> 33:09.762
I want him to be here.

33:09.762 --> 33:11.062
I want to get in the car and go.

33:11.062 --> 33:13.860
- [Narrator] Loren's waiting
for associate Kieran,

33:13.860 --> 33:17.320
who's agreed to make
the 230 mile round trip

33:17.320 --> 33:18.480
to take her home.

33:18.480 --> 33:19.313
- Who's that?

33:20.161 --> 33:22.410
That's fucking Kieran!

33:22.410 --> 33:23.403
Fucking legend.

33:24.259 --> 33:27.496
Oh it's so nice to see
someone, hello! (laughing)

33:27.496 --> 33:29.650
Right, yeah you smell nice, unlike me,

33:29.650 --> 33:31.520
I stink of fucking BO, mate.

33:31.520 --> 33:33.310
Oh my God, you're such a legend,

33:33.310 --> 33:34.808
thank you so much Kier.

33:34.808 --> 33:35.860
I should have got you to bring

33:35.860 --> 33:37.745
some drink with ya, ciders or something.

33:37.745 --> 33:38.864
- I was thinking that you know.

33:38.864 --> 33:40.257
(Loren laughing)

33:40.257 --> 33:43.007
- [Loren] Right, now I just
need to get in and get out.

33:44.552 --> 33:46.040
- [Hunter] Is that Kieran's number?

33:46.040 --> 33:47.254
- Yeah, it's Kieran again.

33:47.254 --> 33:48.087
Ben, Zoe.

33:49.080 --> 33:51.130
Kieran Furguson's phone pinged twice,

33:51.130 --> 33:52.831
traveling just south of Leicester.

33:52.831 --> 33:54.750
- [Ben] I think she's with Kieran Furguson

33:54.750 --> 33:55.583
south bound on the M1.

33:55.583 --> 33:56.416
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

33:56.416 --> 33:57.400
- Oh bloody hell.

33:57.400 --> 33:58.233
- [Peter] What vehicle?

33:58.233 --> 34:00.150
- There's no AMPR hit on his vehicle.

34:00.150 --> 34:01.443
- Pardon?

34:01.443 --> 34:02.276
- Are you joking?

34:02.276 --> 34:04.751
So we've got a phone
traveling down the M1,

34:04.751 --> 34:07.590
with no way of identifying the vehicle

34:07.590 --> 34:09.090
that phone is attached to.

34:09.090 --> 34:11.530
- We're 10s of thousands of vehicles.

34:11.530 --> 34:14.065
- New cell site, it still
looks to be on the M1.

34:14.065 --> 34:14.926
(Ben groaning)

34:14.926 --> 34:17.490
- We need to find out
what bloody car it is.

34:17.490 --> 34:18.612
Fuck sake!

34:18.612 --> 34:21.112
(tense music)

34:26.590 --> 34:28.750
- Yeah we just got another cell ping,

34:28.750 --> 34:30.570
just outside of Rugby on the M1.

34:30.570 --> 34:32.160
- I'd rather a fucking car.

34:32.160 --> 34:34.320
Getting really fucked off now.

34:34.320 --> 34:36.350
- [Narrator] HQ suspect fugitive Loren

34:36.350 --> 34:38.940
is being driven home by associate Kieran,

34:38.940 --> 34:41.630
and are trying to identify his vehicle.

34:41.630 --> 34:43.610
- Guys, we've got a vehicle.

34:43.610 --> 34:44.443
- Come on!

34:44.443 --> 34:45.276
- Right, what is it?

34:45.276 --> 34:46.109
What's the vehicle type?

34:46.109 --> 34:47.256
- [Woman] Ford Transit.

34:47.256 --> 34:50.150
- He's driving the works van, X-ray tango.

34:50.150 --> 34:51.500
White in color.

34:51.500 --> 34:52.540
- Come on.

34:52.540 --> 34:54.410
- [Narrator] Ground hunters Mark and Carl

34:54.410 --> 34:56.150
have been strategically positioned

34:56.150 --> 34:58.460
at a junction off the M25.

34:58.460 --> 34:59.703
- Still no sightings.

35:00.970 --> 35:02.200
- You're an absolute legend.

35:02.200 --> 35:04.129
If you're under the radar, that means

35:04.129 --> 35:06.233
they ain't on to us.

35:07.122 --> 35:09.080
(Loren laughing excitedly)

35:09.080 --> 35:10.510
- [Hunter] Where are you?

35:10.510 --> 35:12.395
- They should be round here now.

35:12.395 --> 35:14.530
- We're in Essex!

35:14.530 --> 35:15.510
Woo!

35:15.510 --> 35:16.970
Ha ha.

35:16.970 --> 35:19.518
I'm fucking shitting myself.

35:19.518 --> 35:22.268
(dramatic music)

35:23.840 --> 35:26.140
- Hang on, I've got it,
I've got it, I've got it!

35:26.140 --> 35:26.973
Positive ID!

35:28.727 --> 35:30.717
Sighting.
- Eyes on the van.

35:30.717 --> 35:33.575
- [Everyone] Yes!

35:33.575 --> 35:36.113
- Okay there it is,
positive, positive sighting.

35:37.010 --> 35:38.040
They have no idea we're here.

35:38.040 --> 35:39.890
Taking the second, taking the second.

35:40.810 --> 35:42.233
It's a left, left, left.

35:43.757 --> 35:46.070
(Loren laughing)

35:46.070 --> 35:48.170
- [Loren] So weird being so close to home.

35:50.577 --> 35:53.210
- [Hunter] Still in a covert capacity.

35:53.210 --> 35:54.703
Four vehicles for cover.

35:55.808 --> 35:57.231
- Yes yes.

35:57.231 --> 35:59.731
(tense music)

36:02.566 --> 36:03.808
- There a Volvo.

36:03.808 --> 36:04.641
- What?

36:04.641 --> 36:05.738
- There's a Volvo.

36:05.738 --> 36:07.143
- [Loren] Fuck, it's them!

36:10.010 --> 36:11.588
- Speed is increasing.

36:11.588 --> 36:13.540
He's aware of our presence.

36:13.540 --> 36:15.625
- [Loren] Pull in my estate and I can run.

36:15.625 --> 36:17.740
- There's alleyways
and walls you can jump,

36:17.740 --> 36:18.573
or anything like that?

36:18.573 --> 36:19.406
- Yeah.

36:20.440 --> 36:22.117
- Left, left, left.

36:22.117 --> 36:24.960
We've got Methersgate nearside.

36:24.960 --> 36:25.793
- Where do you live?

36:25.793 --> 36:27.029
- Right.

36:27.029 --> 36:28.040
- [Hunter] Mom's address.

36:28.040 --> 36:29.200
- [Peter] The known home address.

36:29.200 --> 36:30.590
- [Hunter] It's a dead end as well, boys.

36:30.590 --> 36:32.340
- Gonna go through that alley there.

36:32.340 --> 36:33.173
- What alley?

36:33.173 --> 36:34.137
- That alley in front.

36:34.137 --> 36:35.300
- Directly in front?

36:35.300 --> 36:37.330
- Yeah, do a bit of a diagonal if you can.

36:37.330 --> 36:38.511
Fuck, my heart.

36:38.511 --> 36:41.220
- [Hunter] Prepare for a
de-camp, prepare for a de-camp.

36:41.220 --> 36:43.197
- Pull up on the pavement if you have to.

36:43.197 --> 36:44.683
- [Hunter] Stop, stop, stop.

36:46.141 --> 36:46.974
- She's gone.

36:46.974 --> 36:48.182
- It's out, out, out.

36:48.182 --> 36:49.974
Stay where you are!

36:49.974 --> 36:51.000
Stay where you are!

36:51.000 --> 36:54.051
Hunter team, stay where you are!

36:54.051 --> 36:55.812
Stay where you are!

36:55.812 --> 36:59.257
Hunter team, stay where you are now!

36:59.257 --> 37:01.120
Loren, you've been hunted down.

37:01.120 --> 37:02.439
You've been hunted down.

37:02.439 --> 37:03.272
(everyone cheering)

37:03.272 --> 37:04.874
- Yes, get in, yes!

37:04.874 --> 37:07.542
(everyone clapping)

37:07.542 --> 37:08.380
Yes!

37:08.380 --> 37:09.632
- Fuck.

37:09.632 --> 37:11.133
- Great job guys.

37:13.440 --> 37:14.880
- I'm so glad to see the back of her.

37:14.880 --> 37:16.450
- I'm so relieved.

37:16.450 --> 37:17.590
- You gave us the run around,

37:17.590 --> 37:18.750
and you nearly made it home.

37:18.750 --> 37:20.070
Not good enough, but well done.

37:20.070 --> 37:22.067
- Oh don't say that!

37:22.067 --> 37:23.275
- [Hunter] Yes!

37:23.275 --> 37:25.590
(everyone clapping)

37:25.590 --> 37:26.872
- Let's go.

37:26.872 --> 37:28.672
- [Loren] Really want to see my mom.

37:29.770 --> 37:31.803
- Loren made a number of mistakes.

37:32.801 --> 37:35.080
Heading back to familiar territory

37:35.080 --> 37:37.240
and relying on her home network,

37:37.240 --> 37:39.380
they were all fatal flaws in her plan,

37:39.380 --> 37:41.393
which we graciously exploited.

37:43.092 --> 37:44.609
- I lost.

37:44.609 --> 37:45.442
- Oh no!

37:47.024 --> 37:47.857
I missed you so much.

37:47.857 --> 37:48.893
- I missed you too.

37:50.068 --> 37:51.749
Just emotional.

37:51.749 --> 37:54.320
- I am now. (laughing)

37:54.320 --> 37:55.350
- [Loren] I honestly believe if I didn't

37:55.350 --> 37:57.300
get in touch with Kieran, I would

37:57.300 --> 37:58.650
have still been on the run.

37:59.490 --> 38:00.573
That was my downfall.

38:02.230 --> 38:04.730
Can't even put into words how happy

38:04.730 --> 38:07.530
and grateful I am that I've
had the experience, I can't.

38:09.560 --> 38:12.127
I'm just so gutted that I
didn't make it to the end.

38:17.800 --> 38:20.479
- Let's all get up to
speed on where we're at

38:20.479 --> 38:23.130
with Ish and Nate.

38:23.130 --> 38:24.507
They're playing games with us.

38:24.507 --> 38:25.520
- Yep.

38:25.520 --> 38:29.190
- Earlier was a video on Instagram.

38:29.190 --> 38:31.230
- [Hunter] They did the Instagram live

38:31.230 --> 38:33.090
in Nottingham market square.

38:33.090 --> 38:35.540
- We have to make progress today.

38:35.540 --> 38:38.110
- [Hunter] I need CCTV
analysis of that area.

38:38.110 --> 38:39.810
- [Peter] Time is not on our side.

38:42.560 --> 38:44.180
- Ish and Nate seem to have created

38:44.180 --> 38:47.230
quite a bit of noise as to
where their location is,

38:47.230 --> 38:49.400
which I find slightly bizarre.

38:49.400 --> 38:52.468
There does seem to be something afoot.

38:52.468 --> 38:54.968
(tense music)

38:57.440 --> 38:58.790
- Keep your wits about you.

38:59.840 --> 39:02.600
- [Narrator] Nate plans to
reunite with Ish in Dudley,

39:02.600 --> 39:04.904
helped by associate Drew.

39:04.904 --> 39:06.160
(phone ringing)

39:06.160 --> 39:07.016
- Incoming call.

39:07.016 --> 39:07.849
It's Hafsa.

39:07.849 --> 39:08.822
Ish's sister.

39:08.822 --> 39:10.000
You can't answer that.

39:10.000 --> 39:11.700
You definitely cannot answer that.

39:13.710 --> 39:14.543
Let's go.

39:17.133 --> 39:19.713
Hafsa called, I'm worried
the hunters will see it.

39:20.630 --> 39:22.027
Ah!

39:22.027 --> 39:24.723
That's the thing they're
going to be listening out for.

39:28.450 --> 39:30.980
That phone call, that one phone call

39:30.980 --> 39:32.820
could have blew the whole thing.

39:32.820 --> 39:34.060
What is the likelihood that they could

39:34.060 --> 39:35.147
have caught onto Ish?

39:36.240 --> 39:37.263
- A bit worrying.

39:38.820 --> 39:41.010
- If Ish is being tracked, and he makes

39:41.010 --> 39:43.760
his way to the woods, we
could be driving into trouble.

39:46.175 --> 39:47.803
Do we go to the woods?

39:49.250 --> 39:50.730
I want to go to the woods.

39:50.730 --> 39:52.253
Do we go to the woods?

39:56.430 --> 39:58.075
- [Hunter] Okay guys.

39:58.075 --> 40:00.750
Hafsa Haroona's number has just connected

40:00.750 --> 40:03.120
to the cell tower in Derby.

40:03.120 --> 40:05.182
- [Ben] Sister of Ish.

40:05.182 --> 40:07.320
- Something doesn't add up here.

40:07.320 --> 40:09.953
We just had some CCTV of
Nate and Ish in Nottingham.

40:12.300 --> 40:13.670
Here we go.

40:13.670 --> 40:14.693
- [Hunter] Let's see where they go.

40:14.693 --> 40:18.670
- [Man] Here they are just
crossing the road by Burton.

40:18.670 --> 40:20.390
Actually I don't think that's Ish.

40:20.390 --> 40:21.970
- [Woman] Yeah.

40:21.970 --> 40:22.970
- [Man] Is that Ish?

40:23.830 --> 40:25.060
- [Woman] That is not Ish.

40:25.060 --> 40:26.721
- To me that's Drew.

40:26.721 --> 40:28.321
- [Woman] They might have split.

40:29.330 --> 40:30.680
- Throwing it out there, let's say

40:30.680 --> 40:32.390
the video was produced to draw us

40:32.390 --> 40:34.730
into that area, and they tactically

40:34.730 --> 40:37.310
already decided to split at that point.

40:37.310 --> 40:40.600
Nate went to Nottingham,
did the broadcast.

40:40.600 --> 40:43.247
Ish went with his sister somewhere.

40:44.610 --> 40:45.451
- Yes.

40:45.451 --> 40:47.951
(tense music)

40:55.135 --> 40:56.813
- This area is the meeting point.

40:57.655 --> 41:00.488
(whistle blowing)

41:04.731 --> 41:05.973
For God sake.

41:05.973 --> 41:07.944
I'm going to drop my bag here.

41:07.944 --> 41:08.777
Fuck sake.

41:09.878 --> 41:12.107
I thought they would be here before me.

41:14.850 --> 41:15.930
Shit.

41:15.930 --> 41:17.750
Maybe Drew got stopped.

41:17.750 --> 41:19.603
Maybe they were waiting at the car,

41:20.670 --> 41:22.170
trying to figure out different

41:23.054 --> 41:25.773
way to get down here, so
maybe that's why he's late.

41:28.900 --> 41:31.323
Not going to lie, makes me feel lonely.

41:32.520 --> 41:35.683
We keep each other's
morale and motivation up.

41:37.220 --> 41:39.073
Who am I going to have that chat with?

41:39.987 --> 41:42.820
(whistle blowing)

41:43.920 --> 41:45.080
Nathan.

41:45.080 --> 41:46.003
Oh my days!

41:47.031 --> 41:49.864
(whistle blowing)

41:51.519 --> 41:54.019
(tense music)

41:57.390 --> 41:59.053
Where are you?

41:59.053 --> 41:59.886
(whistle blowing)

41:59.886 --> 42:02.469
(Ish laughing)

42:04.720 --> 42:05.553
Jobe!

42:08.215 --> 42:10.380
Sorry, it's not that
I'm not happy to see ya,

42:10.380 --> 42:11.530
I just thought it was him.

42:11.530 --> 42:12.363
- [Jobe] Still not here yet?

42:12.363 --> 42:13.197
- Nah, they're not here.

42:13.197 --> 42:14.470
You good?

42:14.470 --> 42:16.013
Sorry about the walk.
- Fucking hell!

42:16.013 --> 42:16.846
I saw his live.

42:16.846 --> 42:19.150
If you want to pop to
my house, get a shower.

42:19.150 --> 42:20.010
- Nah.

42:20.010 --> 42:21.910
Half six, he could still be on his way,

42:21.910 --> 42:23.932
just begging that I stayed.

42:23.932 --> 42:25.860
(Ish sighing)

42:25.860 --> 42:26.693
I'm gonna wait.

42:28.110 --> 42:29.454
- Good luck.

42:29.454 --> 42:30.453
- My days.

42:31.320 --> 42:32.893
Hopefully this idiot turns up.

42:35.120 --> 42:37.020
I'm by myself.

42:37.020 --> 42:42.020
After spending weeks, the past three weeks

42:43.020 --> 42:46.653
with him, I do miss him,
I really do miss him.

42:50.740 --> 42:53.010
I mean it's getting dark now,

42:53.010 --> 42:55.900
and I'm still just waiting to hear

42:55.900 --> 42:57.180
that "Oh, hey!

42:59.029 --> 43:00.387
"Go on, my G."

43:01.760 --> 43:03.713
It's peak, it's peak.

43:08.189 --> 43:09.953
I don't want to do this by myself.

43:11.139 --> 43:13.722
(somber music)

43:23.170 --> 43:27.500
- Everything in me was saying
(sighs) this ain't right.

43:27.500 --> 43:29.350
- [Narrator] Nate has
chosen to be dropped off

43:29.350 --> 43:32.683
east of Birmingham, 14 miles from Ish.

43:33.570 --> 43:36.003
- My instinct told me I had to leave.

43:38.627 --> 43:40.723
I've got a really bad feeling
that they've gotten him.

43:45.126 --> 43:46.876
It's not fun anymore.

43:48.130 --> 43:50.030
Now Ish would have probably been cracking

43:50.030 --> 43:53.563
some sort of joke, and I'd
be pretending not to laugh.

43:56.443 --> 43:57.773
Just not having your mate,

44:01.016 --> 44:06.016
and this is like a time of crisis,

44:07.310 --> 44:08.860
and your best mate isn't there.

44:09.911 --> 44:12.411
(tense music)

44:21.307 --> 44:26.307
- Two days to go, weeks of
work, it's come to this.

44:27.684 --> 44:30.500
- This is where the hunt
gets really intense.

44:30.500 --> 44:31.820
Everything that we've done up to now

44:31.820 --> 44:33.230
really goes out of the window,

44:33.230 --> 44:35.530
and it's all about just hunting them

44:35.530 --> 44:37.520
to that extraction point,
and finding where that is,

44:37.520 --> 44:39.210
and getting there before they do.

44:39.210 --> 44:43.160
- Today the fugitives will be notified

44:43.160 --> 44:45.740
of the extraction point details.

44:45.740 --> 44:47.520
- [Narrator] With 48 hours to go,

44:47.520 --> 44:50.400
four fugitives remain at large.

44:50.400 --> 44:52.940
- [Peter] They're gonna wanna
be somewhere fairly central--

44:52.940 --> 44:54.450
- Yes, to act.
- Because they won't know

44:54.450 --> 44:55.850
where the extraction point is,

44:55.850 --> 44:57.470
and they're not going to want to be

44:57.470 --> 44:58.997
marooned in south west Wales,

44:58.997 --> 45:00.670
when they may potentially have

45:00.670 --> 45:02.703
to get to Norfolk, for example.

45:04.983 --> 45:06.610
- You think how long ago it seemed

45:06.610 --> 45:07.860
that we were in Liverpool.

45:07.860 --> 45:09.680
How far we've come since then.

45:09.680 --> 45:10.653
Get through today.

45:11.800 --> 45:13.750
- If any time I've never felt

45:13.750 --> 45:15.211
more nervous, it's now.

45:15.211 --> 45:18.132
Hopefully we can quite possibly

45:18.132 --> 45:19.783
make it to the end.

45:21.080 --> 45:22.403
- Let's do this, Harry.

45:24.480 --> 45:25.960
- [Narrator] The fugitives must access

45:25.960 --> 45:27.760
a pre-recorded message.

45:27.760 --> 45:31.470
It will explain the details
of the extraction location.

45:31.470 --> 45:33.005
- I have no idea what is going

45:33.005 --> 45:34.940
to befall me today, and I just have

45:34.940 --> 45:38.150
to be prepared to be extremely stressed.

45:38.150 --> 45:39.353
I just hope Ish is okay.

45:41.200 --> 45:42.033
- Butchers.

45:44.360 --> 45:45.930
I was wondering if you
could please help me.

45:45.930 --> 45:48.265
- Do you have a phone I could borrow here?

45:48.265 --> 45:49.223
(phone ringing)

45:49.223 --> 45:51.500
- Your extraction will take place

45:51.500 --> 45:55.123
tomorrow at one PM from
Birmingham City Center.

45:56.680 --> 45:58.511
By accessing this message, your exact

45:58.511 --> 46:02.203
current location has been
revealed to the hunters.

46:03.821 --> 46:05.741
- Shit just got real!

46:05.741 --> 46:08.359
(dramatic music)

46:08.359 --> 46:09.583
- Come on!

46:10.639 --> 46:11.472
- Who's out there?

46:11.472 --> 46:12.758
- That's him, that's him!

46:12.758 --> 46:13.794
- [Hunter] Go on boys.

46:13.794 --> 46:15.018
- [Steve] Stay where you are!

46:15.018 --> 46:15.995
Stop!
