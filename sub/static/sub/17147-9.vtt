21:09.645 --> 21:11.980
and this dumb dino doc was forced on me.

21:12.064 --> 21:13.732
I thought if I could scare him away

21:13.815 --> 21:15.359
everything would go back to normal.

21:15.442 --> 21:16.985
Well, he's not scared anymore.

21:17.069 --> 21:19.446
But he does look pretty hungry.

21:19.530 --> 21:21.490
Ever try Captain Cakerz?

21:23.367 --> 21:25.077
(ROARS)

21:25.160 --> 21:26.203
Like I was saying,

21:26.286 --> 21:28.455
there's no such thing as ghosts.

21:28.539 --> 21:30.707
You haven't seen the last of me!

21:30.791 --> 21:31.834
(CLANGS)

21:31.917 --> 21:33.877
Can't move through walls?
What a rip-off!
