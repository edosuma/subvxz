WEBVTT

00:01.800 --> 00:03.461
- Previously on Hannibal...

00:03.500 --> 00:06.697
- You won't be coming back here
for a long time.

00:06.740 --> 00:08.731
- There's something reassuring
about you eating Dr. Lecter.

00:08.770 --> 00:11.432
It makes you the apex predator.

00:11.470 --> 00:14.132
- I am packing loads
of viable sperm.

00:14.180 --> 00:16.569
Stumbled across
any Viable uteruses?

00:16.610 --> 00:19.340
- Where is the polizia ?
- They're being bought

00:19.380 --> 00:21.439
by the same people that bought
Rinaldo Pazzi.

00:21.480 --> 00:23.687
- Is your husband
still in the city?

00:23.720 --> 00:26.211
- (Hannibal ): Chiyoh has always
been very protective of me.

00:26.260 --> 00:29.058
I've taken the liberty of giving
you something to help you relax.

00:29.090 --> 00:32.526
Jack was the first to suggest
getting inside your head.

00:35.100 --> 00:38.263
(sawing)
(screaming)

01:02.630 --> 01:05.258
(clattering)

01:11.500 --> 01:13.536
(sawing)

01:13.570 --> 01:16.767
(muffled screaming)

01:16.810 --> 01:19.734
(heartbeat pounding)

01:19.780 --> 01:22.374
(muffled bang)

01:22.410 --> 01:25.106
(sawing stops)
- Sono un ufficiale del FBI.

01:25.150 --> 01:28.472
Ascoltami.
Mi chiamo Jack Crawford.

01:28.520 --> 01:31.739
(sound muffled)
Sono un ufficiale dell' FBI!

01:31.790 --> 01:34.258
Ascoltami!

01:34.290 --> 01:36.827
Ascoltami...
Ascoltami.

01:36.860 --> 01:38.782
- Commendator Benetti.

01:38.830 --> 01:42.288
Don't imagine you're here
to make an arrest.

01:42.330 --> 01:44.696
_ -_ No. You
Imagine correctly.

01:47.600 --> 01:50.364
(grunt)

01:53.740 --> 01:56.777
Take Lecter and this one.
He'll pay us double for both.

02:00.280 --> 02:02.885
There's no price on your head,
Signor Crawford.

02:05.220 --> 02:07.552
- So...

02:07.590 --> 02:11.458
Hannibal Lecter,
il Mostro di Firenze,

02:11.490 --> 02:13.720
narrowly escapes La Questura.

02:13.760 --> 02:16.320
That how the story goes?

02:16.370 --> 02:19.396
- Missed him by this much.

02:19.440 --> 02:22.637
The good Doctor Lecter
is once more in the wind.

02:22.670 --> 02:26.401
But he left
one last victim.

02:26.440 --> 02:30.547
Open him the way Lecter
opened the other one.

02:30.580 --> 02:33.743
Open him all the way.

02:33.780 --> 02:35.748
Arrivederci.

02:35.780 --> 02:38.817
- Arrivederci.

02:42.330 --> 02:44.525
(saw whirring)

02:49.800 --> 02:51.825
(muffled gunshot)

03:23.300 --> 03:25.564
Wrong floor.

03:25.600 --> 03:28.398
Would you mind
coming over here

03:28.440 --> 03:30.499
and pulling this needle
out of my neck?

03:30.540 --> 03:33.577
- Where did they take them?

03:36.550 --> 03:38.802
- Did you do this?

03:38.850 --> 03:41.910
- Of course.

03:41.950 --> 03:45.386
- I appreciate it.

03:49.290 --> 03:51.986
- You're sitting at Hannibal's
table. You know him.

03:52.030 --> 03:55.591
You know Will.

03:55.630 --> 03:58.394
- I know them.

03:58.430 --> 04:02.366
They are identically different,
Hannibal and Will.

04:02.410 --> 04:05.959
- Where did they take them?

04:06.010 --> 04:08.831
- They are most
likely taking them

04:08.880 --> 04:11.303
to the US. To Maryland.

04:11.350 --> 04:13.272
I can even tell you
the address

04:13.320 --> 04:15.675
once you've pulled this needle
out of my neck.

04:15.720 --> 04:18.416
- Then what?
- My "then what"

04:18.450 --> 04:20.918
consists of getting out
of Florence alive,

04:20.960 --> 04:24.282
since I'm supposed to be dead --

04:24.330 --> 04:26.389
which puts me
in no position to stop

04:26.430 --> 04:28.591
whatever it is _
you Intend on starting.

04:39.110 --> 04:41.874
(inhaling sharply)

04:41.910 --> 04:44.401
- Where?

04:46.380 --> 04:48.416
- Muskrat Farm.

04:48.450 --> 04:51.942
The Verger estate near
the Susquehanna River
in northern Maryland.

05:27.490 --> 05:29.788
(theme music playing)

05:50.510 --> 05:52.546
(buzzing)

05:54.820 --> 05:57.414
- Pronto.

05:57.450 --> 05:59.987
Dimmi tutto.

06:14.170 --> 06:16.832
- Mason has what he wants.

06:18.840 --> 06:20.979
I think it's time
you get what you want.

06:21.010 --> 06:23.877
- He has Hannibal.

06:23.910 --> 06:27.038
He has Will, too.

06:30.920 --> 06:33.684
- Your brother is a sadist.

06:33.720 --> 06:37.827
He'll tort_ure them_ _
and take the time to enjoy It.

06:41.200 --> 06:44.658
That gives us time.

06:51.840 --> 06:55.503
- There's a hush over
Muskrat Farm, Cordell.

06:55.540 --> 07:00.170
Like the quiet
of the old Sabbath.

07:04.090 --> 07:07.912
Smells like salvation.

07:17.670 --> 07:21.731
- Gentlemen, welcome
to Muskrat Farm.

07:21.770 --> 07:23.704
- Your people might have
assassinated me

07:23.740 --> 07:27.904
in Florence, Mason.
- Where's the fun in that?

07:27.940 --> 07:31.740
I still keep
my father's knife,

07:31.780 --> 07:34.908
ever ready to slip into

07:34.950 --> 07:38.989
a pig's back to check
the depth of the fat.

07:39.020 --> 07:42.114
Cordell, if you would.

07:44.890 --> 07:47.825
(low moaning)

07:52.700 --> 07:56.534
(soft moaning)

08:01.710 --> 08:04.679
A little lean, I think.

08:04.710 --> 08:06.974
Maybe we should fatten you up,

08:07.020 --> 08:09.716
shall we?

08:09.750 --> 08:12.514
It is more trouble to move

08:12.560 --> 08:14.915
a semi-wild pig
against its will

08:14.960 --> 08:17.019
than it is
to kidnap a man.

08:17.060 --> 08:19.187
- (Cordell): Pigs are harder
to get hold of

08:19.230 --> 08:22.051
and big ones
are stronger than a man.

08:22.100 --> 08:24.762
- There are
the tusks to consider,

08:24.800 --> 08:28.566
if you want to maintain the
integrity of your abdomen.

08:30.770 --> 08:32.977
Something worth maintaining,

08:33.010 --> 08:35.308
Mr. Graham.

08:35.340 --> 08:39.743
_ _ Tusked beasts
Instinctively disembowel.

08:39.780 --> 08:42.578
- At swine fairs,

08:42.620 --> 08:46.818
I've seen exotic pigs
from all over the world.

08:46.860 --> 08:49.681
You... are the best

08:49.730 --> 08:51.880
of all that I've seen.

08:51.930 --> 08:54.023
We are going to have

08:54.060 --> 08:59.168
some good, funny times,
Dr. Lecter.

09:02.240 --> 09:04.902
Sad news about Jack Crawford.

09:04.940 --> 09:08.273
Appears Hannibal Lecter
killed him in Florence.

09:08.310 --> 09:11.143
I hope there is
some satisfaction

09:11.180 --> 09:15.071
in being the final victim
of the Chesapeake Ripper.

09:15.120 --> 09:19.147
There will certainly
be some notoriety.

09:21.120 --> 09:23.759
- The feces is flying again
in Florence.

09:25.730 --> 09:27.857
Jack Crawford is alive.

09:29.830 --> 09:32.219
- Well, that's disappointing.

09:32.270 --> 09:35.865
- He saw the snatch.

09:35.900 --> 09:38.630
- I trust you haven't betrayed

09:38.670 --> 09:40.706
doctor-patient confidentiality,

09:40.740 --> 09:42.879
Dr. Bloom.

09:42.910 --> 09:45.344
- Your trust
hasn't been misplaced.

09:45.380 --> 09:47.644
- The FBI

09:47.680 --> 09:50.012
is going to catch the first
squeal on the kidnapping.

09:50.050 --> 09:52.109
- The moment Jack Crawford

09:52.150 --> 09:54.880
set foot in Italy,
I registered complaints

09:54.920 --> 09:56.888
with the local authorities,
the sheriff,

09:56.930 --> 09:58.886
the US. Attorney's office,

09:58.930 --> 10:00.898
that he'd been
harassing me,

10:00.930 --> 10:04.718
calling me late at night
with incoherent threats.

10:04.770 --> 10:08.092
- Of course he can't prove
he didn't.

10:08.140 --> 10:12.167
- And it muddies the water.

10:12.210 --> 10:15.008
- Now you can head off
a warrant.

10:15.040 --> 10:17.042
- There will be no warrant

10:17.080 --> 10:20.049
and there will be_
no warrant forthcoming.

10:20.080 --> 10:23.641
- I appreciate wanting
to kill Hannibal Lecter

10:23.690 --> 10:27.956
and I'm not without
benefit from that.

10:27.990 --> 10:30.356
- He can't make_
good on his promise

10:30.390 --> 10:34.053
to murder you if
he's dead, now can he?

10:34.100 --> 10:36.864
- But he's not dead.

10:36.900 --> 10:38.891
Play with your food,
Mason, and you give it

10:38.930 --> 10:40.898
the opportunity to bite back.

10:40.940 --> 10:43.408
- Oh, I'm not
playing, Dr. Bloom.

10:43.440 --> 10:46.102
- Hannibal is.

10:46.140 --> 10:50.042
He's always playing.

10:50.080 --> 10:53.117
(classical music playing)

11:21.410 --> 11:23.401
- I snatched Will Graham

11:23.450 --> 11:27.045
right out of your mouth.
You must be famished.

11:27.080 --> 11:30.186
_ - There is an
Inescapable parallel

11:30.220 --> 11:32.780
between you and Jezebel, Mason.

11:32.820 --> 11:34.913
Keen Bible student
that you are, you'll recall

11:34.960 --> 11:36.882
dogs ate Jezebel's face,

11:36.930 --> 11:40.297
along with the rest of her.
- Well, if Jezebel

11:40.330 --> 11:42.890
was right with the risen Jesus,

11:42.930 --> 11:45.763
the Riz would have
provided her with a new face,

11:45.800 --> 11:48.894
as He has provided mine.

11:50.840 --> 11:53.274
The transplant surgery

11:53.310 --> 11:56.279
is extremely skillful,
which is why Cordell here

11:56.310 --> 11:58.403
will be performing
the face-off.

12:00.820 --> 12:03.914
- Hello.

12:03.950 --> 12:07.056
- You boys remind me of that
German cannibal who advertised

12:07.090 --> 12:09.752
for a friend and then ate him

12:09.790 --> 12:13.248
and his penis before he died.

12:13.300 --> 12:17.122
Tragedy being, the penis
was overcooked.

12:17.170 --> 12:20.230
Go to all that trouble
to eat a friend

12:20.270 --> 12:22.431
and you overcook his penis.

12:22.470 --> 12:25.007
They ate it anyway.
They had to, they committed.

12:25.040 --> 12:28.373
But they didn't enjoy it.

12:28.410 --> 12:32.107
I'm committed to enjoying
every bite of you.

12:32.150 --> 12:35.074
- You're going to

12:35.120 --> 12:38.783
eat him...with my face?

12:38.820 --> 12:42.312
- Yes. I got
a taste for it

12:42.360 --> 12:45.955
after you two
had me eat my nose.

12:45.990 --> 12:49.289
- You must be terribly proud
that you could bring this off,

12:49.330 --> 12:53.096
It's dangerous to get
exactly what you want.

12:53.140 --> 12:56.234
What will you do
after you've eaten me?

12:56.270 --> 12:59.068
- You could wreck
some foster homes

12:59.110 --> 13:01.237
and torment some children?

13:01.280 --> 13:04.875
- No, I'll drink martinis
made with tears.

13:04.910 --> 13:06.878
- But where, Mason,

13:06.920 --> 13:09.514
would the hard-core fun
come from?

13:09.550 --> 13:12.280
(clucking tongue)
- It's foolish

13:12.320 --> 13:16.108
to dilute such ecstatic time
as this

13:16.160 --> 13:19.527
with fears about the future.

13:19.560 --> 13:22.393
Uh, Cordell, Mr. Graham

13:22.430 --> 13:24.466
is looking very dry.

13:24.500 --> 13:27.094
A little moisturizer, please.
- I'm curious,

13:27.140 --> 13:30.109
what will be the first cuts
of me you'll serve?

13:30.140 --> 13:32.904
- The first course, of course,
will be your hands and feet,

13:32.940 --> 13:35.408
sizzling on
a Promethean barbecue.

13:35.440 --> 13:39.069
The coal is white
and very hard,

13:39.110 --> 13:42.375
makes a clear ringing sound
when struck.

13:45.390 --> 13:47.858
- You've thought of everything.

13:47.890 --> 13:50.620
- And after that,

13:50.660 --> 13:52.992
we'll have
a little pajama party,

13:53.030 --> 13:57.126
you and I. You can be
in shorties by then.

13:57.170 --> 14:00.162
Cordell is going to keep you
alive for a very long time.

14:02.370 --> 14:05.066
(screaming)
(flesh tearing)

14:14.420 --> 14:18.117
Well, no pajama party
for you,

14:18.150 --> 14:20.459
Mr. Graham.
We're gonna feed you

14:20.490 --> 14:23.084
to the pigs
as soon as Cordell

14:23.130 --> 14:25.928
has removed your face --

14:25.960 --> 14:29.350
in a much more civilized fashion
than you just trIed
to remove his.

14:58.490 --> 15:04.622
(sizzling)

15:13.610 --> 15:17.478
- Mason would've preferred
to brand your face.

15:17.510 --> 15:20.070
He fought bravely
and with his own funds

15:20.120 --> 15:22.111
against the
Humane Slaughter Act,

15:22.150 --> 15:25.381
and managed to keep
face-branding legal.

15:25.420 --> 15:30.084
- It's very important to Mason
that I have the pig's
experience.

15:30.130 --> 15:33.224
- Mason has done
beautiful things

15:33.260 --> 15:36.127
with these creatures. Hm!

15:36.160 --> 15:38.321
Very special.

15:38.370 --> 15:41.464
Truly a visionary.

15:41.500 --> 15:43.604
- He has a wealth of information
and resources

15:43.640 --> 15:45.631
in his faceless skull.

15:47.610 --> 15:49.475
- The longer
you're respectful,

15:49.510 --> 15:52.570
the longer you'll keep
your tongue.

15:52.610 --> 15:56.478
- And when I do
lose my tongue?

15:56.520 --> 15:59.216
- I'll boil it

15:59.250 --> 16:02.151
and slice it very thin,

16:02.190 --> 16:04.351
marinate it in olive oil,

16:04.390 --> 16:07.655
garlic, parsley and vinegar.

16:07.700 --> 16:10.294
- Simple and clean --

16:10.330 --> 16:12.298
and delicious.

16:12.330 --> 16:14.366
- Have they told you
the drill?

16:16.600 --> 16:19.467
The drill is, in a few hours,
I'll come down here

16:19.510 --> 16:22.434
and remove all you've got below
the elbows and knees.

16:22.480 --> 16:26.109
I'll keep you going
with IVs and tourniquets

16:26.150 --> 16:28.209
until the very last.

16:30.450 --> 16:33.317
Some things are
best saved for last.

16:33.360 --> 16:35.783
Once you're dead,

16:35.820 --> 16:38.220
I'll prepare your
loins and ribs,

16:38.260 --> 16:40.797
aged.

16:40.830 --> 16:43.264
- Meats are aged
not only for tenderness,

16:43.300 --> 16:47.066
but mainly for flavour.
- And flavours change.

16:47.100 --> 16:49.762
Every day I'll feed Mason

16:49.800 --> 16:52.268
some new part of you.

16:52.310 --> 16:55.768
And don't you worry,
Dr. Lecter,

16:55.810 --> 16:59.598
you will always be cooked
to perfection.

17:02.280 --> 17:05.181
- I think I might feed the eel

17:05.220 --> 17:07.518
some delicacy of Lecter --

17:07.560 --> 17:10.620
his genitals, perhaps.

17:12.860 --> 17:16.318
How long have you and Dr. Bloom
been an item?

17:20.670 --> 17:22.592
- Not long.

17:22.640 --> 17:26.531
- Longer than that,
Cordell says.

17:26.570 --> 17:30.472
Does Dr. Bloom want children?

17:30.510 --> 17:34.514
I'm sure you've had a chance to
check under the hood by now.

17:34.550 --> 17:37.678
How's the uterus, intact?

17:37.720 --> 17:42.157
Are the hips childbearing?
Roomy?

17:44.890 --> 17:47.393
- Land the plane, Mason.
- Oh, you've got

17:47.430 --> 17:51.127
a big surprise
coming to you, Margot.

17:51.170 --> 17:53.866
Would it spoil anything
for you

17:53.900 --> 17:57.609
if I told you I've already found
us a surrogate?

17:57.640 --> 18:00.473
Not for my sperm,

18:00.510 --> 18:04.378
but for your eggs.
- I don't have any.

18:04.410 --> 18:08.278
You took them.
- I most certainly did,

18:08.320 --> 18:10.311
but I didn't
Humpty-Dumpty them,

18:10.350 --> 18:14.286
I just went and found them
a new basket.

18:18.530 --> 18:20.657
I told you I wanted
to give you

18:20.700 --> 18:23.498
a Verger baby, our own baby.

18:23.530 --> 18:27.398
Yours and mine. Well...

18:27.440 --> 18:29.635
Mostly yours.

18:44.590 --> 18:46.740
- Where's the surrogate, Mason?

18:48.820 --> 18:51.254
- She's resting at the moment.

18:51.290 --> 18:53.929
- She's here?

18:53.960 --> 18:58.124
- She's on the farm.

18:59.930 --> 19:02.490
- I want to see her.

19:02.540 --> 19:04.667
- Well, first, I think

19:04.710 --> 19:07.577
you need to prepare yourself
psychologically.

19:07.610 --> 19:09.635
I mean, this is going to be

19:09.680 --> 19:13.446
a very emotional experience
for you, Margot.

19:13.480 --> 19:16.449
I have to_ think about
appropriate tImIng.

19:24.560 --> 19:27.222
- Don't think too long, smiley.
(chair clicking)

19:27.260 --> 19:30.559
- Oh! That's the spirit,
Margot!

19:30.600 --> 19:33.592
Your_ maternal instinct
IS reWIng up.

19:33.640 --> 19:35.631
I love it.

19:53.260 --> 19:55.387
- What are you doing here?

19:55.420 --> 19:59.379
- I'm Mason Verger's
psychiatrist.

19:59.430 --> 20:01.489
- Oh...

20:01.530 --> 20:04.920
That part of his therapy
or yours?

20:04.970 --> 20:09.361
_ - I think we're all_
working through some Issues.

20:09.400 --> 20:14.531
I'm putting an emphasis
on self-preservation.

20:20.450 --> 20:22.543
Jack's alive.

20:22.580 --> 20:25.378
- Good for Jack.

20:25.420 --> 20:28.548
You helped Mason Verger
find us.

20:30.790 --> 20:34.294
- I helped Mason
find Hannibal.

20:34.330 --> 20:36.321
We followed
Btard-Montrachet

20:36.360 --> 20:38.396
when we should have
just followed you.

20:38.430 --> 20:40.660
- Almost as ugly as what
Mason wants to do to us

20:40.700 --> 20:42.998
is the fact that he can do it
with the tacit agreement

20:43.040 --> 20:45.361
of people sworn
to uphold the law.

20:45.410 --> 20:48.777
- I was trying to get to
Hannibal before you.

20:48.810 --> 20:51.643
I knew you couldn't
stop yourself,

20:51.680 --> 20:53.739
so I had to try.

20:53.780 --> 20:57.648
- By facilitating
torture and death.

20:59.690 --> 21:02.955
- I can abide the thought
of Hannibal tortured,

21:02.990 --> 21:06.528
not necessarily to death.

21:06.560 --> 21:10.326
I'd say he has it coming,
wouldn't you?

21:12.400 --> 21:14.766
Or maybe you wouldn't.

21:17.370 --> 21:20.635
- What did you think
would happen?

21:20.680 --> 21:23.001
- I thought Jack Crawford
and the FBI

21:23.040 --> 21:25.577
would come to the rescue.

21:25.610 --> 21:27.646
But the finer details

21:27.680 --> 21:30.342
of what I thought would happen
have evolved.

21:32.490 --> 21:35.653
- Then you have
to evolve, Alana.

21:35.690 --> 21:39.456
You have to spill blood.

21:41.600 --> 21:44.364
Either by your own hand or...

21:46.430 --> 21:48.739
someone else's.

22:13.660 --> 22:15.594
- Buonasera, signor.

22:15.630 --> 22:18.997
- Buonasera, Signorina Verger.
(pigs grunting)

22:27.480 --> 22:30.131
- Thank you for coming, Margot.

22:30.180 --> 22:33.718
Hasn't been that long
since I treated you.

22:33.750 --> 22:35.718
Have you started taking

22:35.750 --> 22:39.117
the chocolate,
as Mason likes to say,

22:39.150 --> 22:41.857
after you fought him
for so long?

22:41.890 --> 22:45.519
- Are we in therapy now?

22:45.560 --> 22:48.688
- You tell me.

22:59.540 --> 23:02.031
- Mason promised to give
something back to me.

23:02.080 --> 23:05.846
Something that he stole.

23:05.880 --> 23:09.714
There was a surrogate all along.

23:09.750 --> 23:12.810
It's a Verger baby.

23:12.850 --> 23:15.853
It's my baby.

23:17.960 --> 23:20.656
- Mason will deny you.

23:20.700 --> 23:23.021
He will always deny you.

23:23.060 --> 23:26.097
You know you'll
have to kill him.

23:29.240 --> 23:32.835
- You saying you'd do it for me?

23:34.780 --> 23:36.907
I could never trust you.

23:36.940 --> 23:39.875
- No, of course not.

23:42.150 --> 23:45.608
But you could trust me never
to deny that I did it.

23:45.650 --> 23:47.811
It would actually be more
therapeutic for you

23:47.860 --> 23:50.112
to kill him yourself.

23:50.160 --> 23:54.620
You'll remember I recommended
that In seSSIon.

23:54.660 --> 23:58.164
- Wait until I could get away
with it, you said.

24:02.570 --> 24:05.630
- What difference would one more
murder charge make to me?

24:10.650 --> 24:13.141
I'm the only other suspect
you've got.

24:15.650 --> 24:17.880
You_can_do it
when It swts you,

24:17.920 --> 24:20.138
and I'll write a letter

24:20.190 --> 24:22.579
gloating about how much
I enjoyed

24:22.620 --> 24:25.919
killing him myself.

24:30.160 --> 24:32.162
- Buonasera.

24:39.010 --> 24:41.934
- He has a pocketknife.

25:03.230 --> 25:05.198
- I was trying to save Will

25:05.230 --> 25:07.835
from you...

25:07.870 --> 25:12.500
but right now, you're the
only one who can save him.

25:15.740 --> 25:18.573
Promise me you'll save him.

25:22.950 --> 25:25.282
Please.

25:29.290 --> 25:32.225
- I promise.

25:35.030 --> 25:38.761
And I always keep
my promises, Alana.

25:38.800 --> 25:42.031
Just cut the ropes

25:42.070 --> 25:44.106
on one arm,

25:44.140 --> 25:46.199
give me the knife and leave.

25:46.240 --> 25:48.629
I can do the rest.

26:08.730 --> 26:11.665
- Are you going
to kill Mason?

26:11.700 --> 26:13.861
- Margot is.

26:15.900 --> 26:19.802
Snatch some of my hair --
back from the hairline,
if you don't mind.

26:19.840 --> 26:23.640
get some skin.

26:23.680 --> 26:27.776
Put it in Mason's hand
after he's dead.

26:30.890 --> 26:33.779
- Could I have ever
understood you?

26:38.130 --> 26:40.189
- No.

26:40.230 --> 26:44.360
(tearing)

27:14.100 --> 27:17.820
(heart monitor beeping)

27:21.400 --> 27:24.335
- Now, Cordell told me

27:24.370 --> 27:27.407
ifI waited long enough,

27:27.440 --> 27:32.002
he could grow me a new face
from my own cells.

27:32.050 --> 27:35.110
_ But I was adamant
It was your face I wanted.

27:35.150 --> 27:37.311
I was looking at your face

27:37.350 --> 27:39.944
while you were watching me
cut mine off and I thought,

27:39.990 --> 27:43.687
"Oh, that's a nice face."

27:43.730 --> 27:45.925
- You're going under now,
Mr. Verger.

27:45.960 --> 27:50.351
When you wake up, your face
will be bound and uncomfortable.

27:53.170 --> 27:55.968
- Have you accepted Jesus,
Mr. Graham?

27:56.000 --> 27:58.901
Do you have faith?

27:58.940 --> 28:03.070
I do. I'm free!

28:03.110 --> 28:05.874
Hallelujah!

28:19.330 --> 28:23.096
- This will immobilize
your body,

28:23.130 --> 28:27.760
but you'll feel everything.

28:31.510 --> 28:35.230
I'm going to cut off your face
without anesthesia, Mr. Graham.

29:36.600 --> 29:39.831
- Is he alive?

29:47.510 --> 29:50.843
- There's no fetal heartbeat.

29:53.890 --> 29:58.281
- Take it out. Take it out!

30:10.940 --> 30:13.829
- You'll be sure to let me know
if this hurts,

30:13.880 --> 30:16.235
won't
you?

31:23.950 --> 31:26.339
(laboured breathing)

31:36.360 --> 31:38.521
- Cordell?

31:38.560 --> 31:42.098
Cordell!

31:46.570 --> 31:49.596
CORDELL!

32:07.350 --> 32:10.251
(silenced shot)

32:22.200 --> 32:24.737
CORDELL!

32:24.770 --> 32:27.568
Cordell!

32:27.610 --> 32:31.046
- Hi, Mason.

32:33.010 --> 32:35.342
- What the hell is going on
out there? Where's Cordell?

32:35.380 --> 32:37.519
- Cordell's dead.

32:37.550 --> 32:39.984
They're all dead out there.

32:40.020 --> 32:42.386
Hannibal got away.

32:42.420 --> 32:44.627
- Well, get on the horn
to Washington

32:44.660 --> 32:47.288
and get four of those bastards
with guns

32:47.330 --> 32:50.959
up here now!
Send the helicopter!

32:53.300 --> 32:57.066
- I found your
surrogate, Mason.

32:57.100 --> 32:59.432
(chuckling)

32:59.470 --> 33:01.779
- Your surrogate, Margot.

33:01.810 --> 33:05.348
I promised you I'd give you
a Verger baby.

33:05.380 --> 33:08.144
- I'm taking

33:08.180 --> 33:11.081
what you promised me.

33:11.120 --> 33:13.680
And I've got everything

33:13.720 --> 33:15.711
I need from you now.

33:17.820 --> 33:21.028
- You can't kill me, Margot.

33:21.060 --> 33:24.029
You'll lose everything.

33:24.070 --> 33:26.493
"In the absence of an heir,

33:26.530 --> 33:29.135
"the sole beneﬁciary

33:29.170 --> 33:32.162
is the Southern Baptist Church."

33:32.210 --> 33:36.271
- But there is going to be
an heir, Mason.

33:36.310 --> 33:38.278
A Verger baby.

33:38.310 --> 33:41.245
Yours, mine...

33:43.220 --> 33:45.438
Mostly yours.
- Do you know what happens

33:45.490 --> 33:49.312
if we stimulate your prostate
gland with a cattle prod?

33:49.360 --> 33:52.056
Hannibal does.

33:52.090 --> 33:57.118
He helped us milk you.
- Ah, you're dead, Dr. Bloom.

33:57.160 --> 34:00.721
- No, Mason. We all are.

34:00.770 --> 34:03.591
Didn't you know that?

34:03.640 --> 34:05.699
But these aren't.

34:05.740 --> 34:08.038
(grunting)

35:14.180 --> 35:17.399
- Will you go home?

35:17.440 --> 35:19.908
CAN you go home?

35:19.950 --> 35:24.216
- No more than you can.

35:27.250 --> 35:30.686
- Would you watch over me?
- I will.

35:30.720 --> 35:34.292
Not in a cage.

35:34.330 --> 35:38.266
Some beasts
shouldn't be caged.

35:38.300 --> 35:41.792
- Your obsessive
and successful hunt,

35:41.840 --> 35:46.334
whose plight
was it driven by? Mine?

35:46.370 --> 35:48.930
Yours?

35:48.980 --> 35:52.143
- Mischa's.

35:57.980 --> 36:00.210
Did you eat her?

36:03.560 --> 36:05.482
- Yes.

36:05.530 --> 36:07.555
But I did not kill her.

36:07.590 --> 36:10.889
The most stable elements,
Chiyoh,

36:10.930 --> 36:14.263
appear in the middle
of the periodic table,

36:14.300 --> 36:17.758
roughly between
iron and silver.

36:23.840 --> 36:25.899
Between iron and silver --

36:25.950 --> 36:30.171
I think that's appropriate
for you.

36:40.530 --> 36:42.589
(shattering porcelain)

36:53.570 --> 36:56.698
(door creaking)

37:23.840 --> 37:26.331
(sighing)

37:31.850 --> 37:34.410
- Do we talk about
teacups and tIme

37:34.450 --> 37:36.839
and the rules of disorder?

37:38.820 --> 37:41.414
- The teacup's broken.

37:44.990 --> 37:48.391
It's never going to gather
itself back together again.

37:51.730 --> 37:54.369
- Not even in your mind?

37:58.610 --> 38:01.408
Your memory palace
is building. It's...

38:01.440 --> 38:03.601
...full of new things.

38:03.640 --> 38:06.677
It shares some rooms
WIth my own.

38:09.550 --> 38:13.384
I've discovered you there,
victorious.

38:13.420 --> 38:16.651
- When it comes
to you and me,

38:18.630 --> 38:21.428
there can _be
no deCISIve VIctory.

38:25.630 --> 38:28.758
- We are in zero-sum game?

38:33.940 --> 38:37.535
- I miss my dogs.

38:39.950 --> 38:43.841
I'm not going to miss you.

38:43.880 --> 38:47.509
(sighing)

38:50.460 --> 38:53.987
I'm not going to find you.

38:54.030 --> 38:58.592
I'm not going to look for you.

38:58.630 --> 39:00.769
I don't want to know

39:00.800 --> 39:04.804
where you are or what you do.

39:08.710 --> 39:11.031
I don't want to think
about you anymore.

39:17.420 --> 39:19.581
- You delight in wickedness
and then

39:19.620 --> 39:21.588
berate yourself for the delight.

39:21.620 --> 39:25.522
- You delight.

39:25.560 --> 39:28.996
I tolerate.

39:32.930 --> 39:37.560
I don't have your appetite.

39:42.080 --> 39:46.471
Goodbye, Hannibal.

40:24.020 --> 40:26.011
(door closing)

40:55.720 --> 40:57.745
- He's gone, Jack.

41:00.290 --> 41:02.508
-Jack!

41:04.060 --> 41:07.450
I'm here.

41:22.810 --> 41:26.041
- You finally caught the
Chesapeake Ripper, Jack.

41:26.080 --> 41:30.847
- I didn't catch you,

41:30.880 --> 41:34.145
you surrendered.

41:34.190 --> 41:36.784
- I want you to know
exactly where I am

41:36.820 --> 41:39.584
and where you can
always find me.

41:55.940 --> 41:57.908
- Cuff him.

41:57.940 --> 42:01.273
Put him in my car.

42:35.120 --> 42:38.146
