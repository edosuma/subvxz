30:16.694 --> 30:18.549
She could actually see him.

30:18.550 --> 30:22.930
The intense response I had inside was...

30:23.501 --> 30:24.835
Got you.

30:24.836 --> 30:26.996
Got you.

30:30.475 --> 30:34.778
The next thing I knew, I felt
like I'm in that green car.

30:34.779 --> 30:38.048
I looked down; It was a man's hands.

30:38.049 --> 30:41.949
And they were long fingers, slim.

30:42.220 --> 30:47.860
I felt that I was looking
through the eyes of a killer.

30:53.998 --> 30:57.306
By this time, we'd been by
all the murder scenes and,

30:57.307 --> 30:59.696
Nancy had come up with a
lot of good information,

30:59.697 --> 31:02.282
but it was nothing we could act on.

31:02.283 --> 31:07.575
What we needed from her was
relatives, a place of business, a name.

31:07.576 --> 31:11.536
I felt that it was beyond urgent.

31:16.454 --> 31:18.789
All of a sudden, Nancy perks
up, and she says, Bill...

31:18.790 --> 31:19.879
What town are we in?

31:19.880 --> 31:22.192
I says, well, we're in
Mendham Township right now.

31:22.193 --> 31:25.062
He's got a real deep
hatred for the cops here.

31:25.063 --> 31:27.264
There's only one reason a
guy doesn't like the cops...

31:27.265 --> 31:31.001
They've either gotten a ticket, or they've
gotten locked up by the Police Department.

31:31.002 --> 31:34.635
So I said, well, let's take a ride
by Mendham Township Police Department,

31:34.636 --> 31:39.676
see if they can help us
out here a little bit.

31:39.811 --> 31:44.715
We told the Captain we had a person
with us that might have some information.

31:44.716 --> 31:46.765
I had no idea what I would say.

31:46.766 --> 31:51.626
Jimmy and Bill had no
idea what I would say.

31:51.989 --> 31:54.569

And suddenly...

31:57.795 --> 31:59.663
[Siren blips]

31:59.664 --> 32:04.634
I blurted out everything, wondering
where those words were coming from.

32:04.635 --> 32:06.269
You have a police officer...

32:06.270 --> 32:08.905
Who, in the summer, gave at least...

32:08.906 --> 32:11.966
One ticket to a man.

32:13.644 --> 32:17.904
And that police officer's last name...

32:18.983 --> 32:21.457
Begins with a C.

32:21.458 --> 32:24.160
Uh, well, you... that's...
you're thinking of Costanza.

32:24.161 --> 32:25.834
[Echoing] Costanza, Costanza...

32:25.835 --> 32:28.415
Costanza. Yeah.

32:30.033 --> 32:32.793
And the ticket...

32:34.699 --> 32:37.400
Costanza issued him the
ticket. I can see it happening.

32:37.401 --> 32:43.041
I said, I'm pretty sure
Costanza will know who this is.

32:47.345 --> 32:49.385
[Sighs]

32:51.449 --> 32:52.784
I may have a name.

32:52.785 --> 32:56.453
I kept seeing pieces of a name.

32:56.454 --> 32:58.188
James.

32:58.189 --> 33:00.824
She saw a name...

33:00.825 --> 33:02.058
K.

33:02.059 --> 33:03.827
A partial name.

33:03.828 --> 33:06.048

33:06.297 --> 33:08.435

And I could not make
out the middle of it.

33:25.298 --> 33:26.991
But I can't see the other letters.

33:26.992 --> 33:28.985
Out of the clear blue
sky, she blurts this out.

33:28.986 --> 33:30.353
I'm sorry. I can't.

33:30.354 --> 33:32.289
That was a big moment for us.

33:32.290 --> 33:34.666
- Can we speak to Costanza?
- He's on vacation.

33:34.667 --> 33:36.674
He doesn't come in again till Monday.

33:36.675 --> 33:40.664
Back in the '80s, when officers
were off duty, they were off duty.

33:40.665 --> 33:41.932
Where can we get a hold of him?

33:41.933 --> 33:44.109
You can't get a hold
of him until Monday.

33:44.110 --> 33:47.470
And you got to remember, this is
1982. There are no cell phones.

33:47.471 --> 33:49.105
That's protocol. Sorry, guys.

33:49.106 --> 33:50.740
We were powerless at that point.

33:50.741 --> 33:52.057
Thanks for your time.

33:52.058 --> 33:54.562
You can only imagine the
frustration that we're going through.

33:54.563 --> 34:00.463
We knew we had something that... it could
break the case, and we can't get to it.

34:00.551 --> 34:03.887
All of a sudden, an alert
goes out over the radio system.

34:03.888 --> 34:08.391
All task force members are called
to meet at police headquarters.

34:08.391 --> 34:12.141
So I drop Jim and Nancy off, and
I'm gonna look for a parking place.

34:12.143 --> 34:15.494
I was kind of excited about
being able to tell the prosecutor

34:15.495 --> 34:18.568
what we had discovered with Nancy.

34:18.569 --> 34:22.922
I thought, maybe with the
prosecutor's influence...

34:22.924 --> 34:26.226
We might be able to go to the
Mendham Township Police Department and

34:26.226 --> 34:28.777
check the files over the weekend
instead of waiting till Monday.

34:28.779 --> 34:31.418

haven't even heard what we have to say.

35:03.011 --> 35:04.274
I don't want to hear it.

35:04.275 --> 35:06.193
I know that woman. She's a psychic.

35:06.194 --> 35:07.797
I was pissed at the prosecutor.

35:07.798 --> 35:13.698
Why would you not want to listen
to possible good information?

35:14.174 --> 35:15.327
I said, well, you know what?

Well, you know what?
If you don't want her...

35:17.351 --> 35:19.018

35:30.486 --> 35:33.488
Jim is livid. Jim is hot.

35:33.489 --> 35:36.191
He had 20 years of experience.

35:36.192 --> 35:40.812
They had no right to
treat him like that.

35:43.832 --> 35:48.392
I was now troubled
beyond, beyond, beyond.

35:48.822 --> 35:52.002
My temperature was 105.

35:52.571 --> 35:57.139
What's the point of being
that close to the horrors...

35:57.140 --> 36:00.260
If I cannot stop him?

36:03.118 --> 36:06.058

36:06.614 --> 36:09.191
Was of one of impending danger.

36:09.192 --> 36:13.212

got to do something here.

Hi. I need your help.

36:29.819 --> 36:35.719
For years, I taught an open group of
meditation and psychic development.

36:35.746 --> 36:38.185
I realized, with my students that,

36:38.186 --> 36:41.956
if we gather energy together,
it becomes amplified.

36:41.957 --> 36:47.857
Here were four people who I knew
to be very psychically clear.

36:49.465 --> 36:53.735
I said, now, we need to
make a difference here.

36:53.736 --> 36:59.256
So we made a circuit, and
we were boosting the signal.

37:00.409 --> 37:03.219
I said, build the power with me.

37:03.220 --> 37:08.118
Take that energy, like
taking a lightning bolt.

in the middle of the room.

he was a bug in a microscope.

That he has given to women.

him feel it in a way...

it out to anybody else...

mean, what did I do?

been stabbed in the back.

they found a Chevy sedan,

And a man was there,
bleeding from a minor wound.

about a green Chevy with three
taillights involved in this case.

He remembered that that was the
kind of car that we were looking for.

39:19.434 --> 39:22.014

39:22.015 --> 39:24.387
They asked him who he was.

He claims he was stabbed in the back by
a woman with shoulder-length brown hair.

40:04.728 --> 40:09.371
And then when I described the
alleged woman that stabbed Koedatich.

40:09.372 --> 40:15.272
I said, he was describing you, because
the general description fits you perfectly.

40:17.207 --> 40:20.901
Anyhow, the wound was self-inflicted.

40:20.902 --> 40:23.778
They found out that there
was no woman involved.

belonged to Amie Hoffman.

And they found a lot of evidence in the
car, especially in the trunk of the car.

41:09.887 --> 41:14.027
They found hair, which would
later, through DNA testing,

41:14.028 --> 41:17.997
come back to be Deirdre O'Brien's hair.

41:17.998 --> 41:20.916
Nancy knew that Deirdre had been
thrown in the trunk of the car.

41:20.917 --> 41:22.682
She described that. Nobody saw that.

get thrown in the trunk.
