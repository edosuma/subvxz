00:12.410 --> 00:15.732
Emma:
[1‘19 dad. Hes back.
What up, my lakewood sixers?

00:15.740 --> 00:18.709
Though, technically, there are
only five of us at the moment.

00:18.710 --> 00:20.701
What? No one's talked to him
Since we, like, broke up?

00:20.710 --> 00:23.247
Talking about Jake Fitzgerald.
That's your boyfriend, right?

00:23.250 --> 00:26.014
(Screaming)
Sta V0.’
Hha/A/ answered; huh?

00:26.020 --> 00:27.339
He must really /0 ve you.

00:27.350 --> 00:29.887
All you people who think
you know everything

00:29.890 --> 00:32.017
about the lakewood six,
you don't know us.

00:32.030 --> 00:36.387
Brooke, you're special to me.
I don't even know who you are.

00:36.400 --> 00:40.222
(Suspenseful music playing)
(Gasps)

00:40.770 --> 00:44.262
Piper... a girl accomplice?
Do you remember
what she looked like?

00:44.270 --> 00:47.000
Crescent palms.
Distorted voice:
Play it cool, scumbag.

00:47.010 --> 00:49.399
Or I'll strangle you
with your own intestines.

00:49.410 --> 00:51.674
Noah:
Eddie told me
about this storage unit.

00:51.680 --> 00:53.671
There ’5 stuﬁ‘ in there
that might belong to P/,'oer.

00:53.680 --> 00:57.013
Figured you'd want to be there.
Film the big reveal?

00:58.020 --> 01:00.341
Audrey:
Wou/o'n ’t m/lss it.

01:01.320 --> 01:03.345
Jake.

01:07.960 --> 01:09.484
(Suspenseful music playing)

01:09.500 --> 01:12.389
(Breathing heavily)

01:49.840 --> 01:52.400
(Ringtone playing)

01:52.410 --> 01:56.335
Distorted voice:
Hey, k/7/er.
You get my message?

01:56.340 --> 01:59.002
(Muttering)
I don't...

01:59.010 --> 02:01.604
How could you...
How could you do this to Jake?

02:01.610 --> 02:03.874
Gonna call the police?
0h, thats right.

02:03.880 --> 02:09.648
Can ’t really, can you?
Got you in a nasty place,
I guess.

02:09.660 --> 02:11.719
(Hangs up)

02:45.430 --> 02:47.455
What does that mean,
"dad's back"?

02:47.460 --> 02:50.998
It means I saw him.
We talked.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.299
You saw him here?
In lakewood?

02:54.300 --> 03:00.432
Yeah. We're, uh...
Having breakfast.

03:00.440 --> 03:04.433
Wow. Did he...
What did he say?

03:04.440 --> 03:08.547
Not much. You know,
that he's sorry. That...

03:08.880 --> 03:12.941
That he wants
to be here for me now.

03:13.590 --> 03:15.683
Oh, honey...

03:16.460 --> 03:19.714
I know you love your dad,
and he loved us, he did,

03:19.730 --> 03:21.948
but he had
his own difficulties.

03:21.960 --> 03:24.724
Promise me
you'll be careful.
Mom, I...

03:24.730 --> 03:27.028
I can't promise you anything.

03:27.030 --> 03:29.863
I... have no idea
what to expect.

03:29.870 --> 03:31.758
I just know that
i have to talk to him.

03:31.770 --> 03:35.866
I have to hear
what he's going to say.

03:36.410 --> 03:40.574
Does that make sense?
Of course.

03:41.710 --> 03:44.349
(Birds tweeting outside)

03:49.060 --> 03:51.358
(Phone vibrating)

03:52.660 --> 03:54.025
Hey! Emma, are you okay?

03:54.030 --> 03:55.884
Yeah. .7 o’io’n’tmean
to scare you.

03:55.900 --> 03:58.721
No, uh, it's just early.
Um, what's up?

03:58.730 --> 04:03.019
My dad's back. I don't know.
You're the only one who
knew him before he left.

04:03.040 --> 04:06.965
And I haven't slept all night
and I'm totally freaking out.

04:06.970 --> 04:13.569
Wow. He just shows up...
Literally when you get
back to town?

04:13.580 --> 04:14.979
How long has he been here?

04:14.980 --> 04:17.972
I don't know.
I didn't interrogate him.

04:18.920 --> 04:20.581
Doesn't it seem
a lIttle suspICIous?

04:20.590 --> 04:23.013
You know, like,
the timing of it all?

04:23.020 --> 04:25.887
What do you mean
"the timing of it"?

04:25.890 --> 04:30.486
Um, I mean, like, where was he
when all of our friends,

04:30.500 --> 04:31.956
everyone we knew,
was getting slaughtered?

04:31.970 --> 04:33.722
When you were actually
in danger?

04:33.730 --> 04:37.734
Well, um, we're meeting
for breakfast. 50, maybe
we'll get into some of that.

04:37.740 --> 04:41.767
It just seems a little strange
that he's suddenly here now.

04:41.770 --> 04:43.067
Yeah, I get that,
but come on,

04:43.080 --> 04:45.708
you remember how good he was
before he left, right?

04:45.710 --> 04:48.679
I'm just... I'm trying
to focus on that. (Chuckles)

04:48.680 --> 04:52.719
Mmm... actually,
i kinda remember him
being a little off.

04:52.720 --> 04:57.555
He wasn't off.
What do you mean "off"?

04:57.760 --> 04:58.886
He was damaged, Emma.

04:58.890 --> 05:03.020
I wouldn't have used
that word when we were little,
but he was damaged.

05:03.030 --> 05:05.521
When Brandon James
killed all of his...

05:05.530 --> 05:07.498
He went through a lot, okay?

05:07.500 --> 05:10.560
We should definitely be able
to understand that.

05:10.570 --> 05:13.437
And maybe he's better now.
People can recover.

05:13.440 --> 05:15.965
Em, he just left you
without any explanation.

05:15.980 --> 05:19.199
What about that?
You should be careful.

05:19.210 --> 05:21.849
Yeah. Okay,
i shouldn't have called you.

05:21.850 --> 05:26.810
Wait, are you pissed at me?
Um, I'll see you later.

05:29.990 --> 05:32.754
(Knocking)
Hey, sleepyhead! I've been
texting you since dawn.

05:32.760 --> 05:34.978
Ready to check
the storage unit?
Let's go, go, go!

05:34.990 --> 05:36.821
Yeah, just give me
one sec, okay?

05:36.830 --> 05:40.527
One second.
Meet me out front.

05:46.940 --> 05:48.965
Thank you.

05:49.180 --> 05:51.637
This place is, uh, nice.

05:51.640 --> 05:52.800
It's, um, hip.

05:52.810 --> 05:55.870
Or whatever the word
for "hip" is now.

05:55.880 --> 05:59.008
Yeah. Yeah, no,
it... it works.

06:00.250 --> 06:05.608
I, um... I work here.
Or I used to, before...

06:05.630 --> 06:10.124
I am starting again
next week.

06:14.800 --> 06:15.698
I'm sorry.

06:15.700 --> 06:20.137
I wanted to come back,
but I just... I couldn't,
uh, get it together.

06:20.140 --> 06:26.875
That's my fault.
And then, your mom said
that you weren't ready to...

06:26.880 --> 06:28.609
See me, so...

06:28.610 --> 06:31.670
Mom told you not to come?

06:33.220 --> 06:35.780
She has her reasons.

06:37.860 --> 06:38.884
I missed a lot.

06:38.890 --> 06:42.678
But when I saw on the news
what happened with your...
With Piper...

06:42.700 --> 06:45.692
We don't... we don't
have to get into that.

06:45.700 --> 06:46.849
Being a survivor is painful.

06:46.870 --> 06:49.225
Having to remember
all of your friends' faces...

06:49.240 --> 06:55.634
This isn't...
I'm fine, honestly.

06:58.640 --> 07:01.905
I need to ask you
this one thing.

07:01.910 --> 07:03.241
Anything.

07:03.250 --> 07:05.912
I understand that you and mom
couldn't make it work.

07:05.920 --> 07:10.289
I get that. Sometimes,
people just don't fit together.

07:10.290 --> 07:15.182
And, now, I know what
you went through with Piper.

07:15.190 --> 07:16.259
The lies, all of it.

07:16.260 --> 07:21.596
I understand why you
ran away from this place...

07:22.140 --> 07:23.789
But...

07:24.970 --> 07:27.768
(Takes deep breath)

07:28.110 --> 07:30.874
Why'd you have to leave me?

07:34.350 --> 07:36.875
I can't explain that.

07:52.970 --> 07:56.724
(Line ringing,
phone ringing)

07:56.740 --> 07:59.265
Hi, honey.
How was breakfast?

07:59.270 --> 08:02.239
Did you tell dad
not to contact me?

08:02.240 --> 08:04.208
(Sighs)

08:04.940 --> 08:08.205
It's not that simple.
When he called out of the blue,

08:08.210 --> 08:10.917
I said that now might
not be the best time.

08:10.920 --> 08:12.615
You could have
told me that last night.

08:12.620 --> 08:15.646
I’m tired
of all these secrets.
(Hangs up)

08:15.660 --> 08:17.013
(Sighs)
(Train whistle blowing)

08:17.020 --> 08:20.114
So, who were you
on the phone with
basically at dawn?

08:20.130 --> 08:25.659
Hey, fun story.
None of your business.
Always so mysterious.

08:25.870 --> 08:29.658
Look, maybe we should
go get breakfast instead
of breaking and entering?

08:29.670 --> 08:32.138
I'll spring for pancakes.
No pancakes. Ooh, wait!

08:32.140 --> 08:36.258
Hey, frame me up.
Maybe use, like, a Dutch angle
so it's creepier.

08:36.280 --> 08:38.077
I got it.

08:39.410 --> 08:41.344
This is it.

08:41.810 --> 08:45.814
Oh, what? The unit
was already unlocked?

08:45.820 --> 08:48.243
Crescent palms guy
was hazing you.

08:48.250 --> 08:49.842
We'll see.

08:49.860 --> 08:51.350
You recording?
Yup.

08:51.360 --> 08:57.424
(Suspenseful music playing)

09:05.370 --> 09:10.160
Ugh, this is such
a lame disappointment.
All this hype and then nothing.

09:10.180 --> 09:15.800
It's like everyone
saying, ”go see
the Blair
witch project
," right?

09:16.280 --> 09:17.816
Hey! Are you listening?

09:17.820 --> 09:24.316
What'd you expect, Noah?
Some giant neon sign flashing
"Piper was... here"?

09:25.790 --> 09:30.818
Uh... hey, um...
Let's jet, okay?
Before someone else shows.

09:30.830 --> 09:34.994
Someone else! You're a genius.
That's why the lock was broken.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.820
'Cause someone else
got here first, right?

09:36.840 --> 09:39.729
Someone who didn't want anyone
to find whatever was in here.

09:39.740 --> 09:44.473
So, that means there was
definitely something to find.

09:44.480 --> 09:45.879
Right?

09:45.880 --> 09:49.338
Oh! What do we have here?
Hey, hey!
You can't just take that.

09:49.350 --> 09:51.477
It might be there
for security.
First, this is new.

09:51.480 --> 09:55.985
Second, that thing over there
is for security.

09:57.360 --> 10:00.181
Someone's been keeping an eye
on this place. Maybe Eddie...

10:00.190 --> 10:02.055
Who's Eddie?
Ugh, the Crescent palms guy.

10:02.060 --> 10:06.759
Come on.
We've got time before school
to see what's on this.

10:12.310 --> 10:15.234
Okay, you'll be
standing in a line.

10:15.240 --> 10:18.209
Shoulders back, like this.
That's good.

10:18.210 --> 10:20.678
And, as you're introduced,
you'll step up.

10:20.680 --> 10:22.773
Look, I've upgraded
from texting to voicemail

10:22.780 --> 10:26.819
to further express my level
of "you are so dead."

10:26.820 --> 10:31.780
(Sighs) I bite the bullet
and I tell my dad about you,
then you ghost?

10:31.790 --> 10:34.258
That is not getting
back together, Jake.

10:34.260 --> 10:38.458
This is all very strange.
Call me.

10:40.570 --> 10:42.390
Hey, I know we don't really
know each other,

10:42.400 --> 10:46.496
but this lady of the lake
pageant does not seem
like your thing.

10:46.510 --> 10:50.401
My dad is making me.
Maddox pride.

10:50.410 --> 10:52.605
So, then,
he'll be your escort?

10:52.610 --> 10:55.841
Oh, I haven't even thought
about that. Um, no.

10:55.850 --> 10:58.569
Who has their dad
as their escort?

10:58.580 --> 11:00.445
Uh, I do.
(Chuckles)

11:00.450 --> 11:03.578
And I avoid all high school
guy drama. Win-win.

11:03.590 --> 11:08.482
Oh, please. Everybody knows
you have a crush on Noah.

11:08.490 --> 11:10.856
You practically give him
eye baths in psych class.

11:10.860 --> 11:15.695
Okay, no, I do not do that.
A little bit.

11:16.600 --> 11:19.239
Okay, well,
maybe there's a world

11:19.240 --> 11:22.403
where I think Noah
is kind of cool.

11:22.410 --> 11:25.402
Happy?
(Scoffs)

11:28.350 --> 11:29.840
Hold that thought.

11:29.850 --> 11:33.775
Woman: Okay, ladies,
grab a worksheet.

11:36.190 --> 11:38.556
Thank you all
for participating.

11:38.560 --> 11:40.312
Not a spectator event.

11:40.330 --> 11:41.888
Came early
to get in some laps

11:41.890 --> 11:43.824
and accidentally
discovered this circus.

11:43.830 --> 11:45.957
It's a traditional
scholarship program

11:45.970 --> 11:47.892
with a charity component.

11:47.900 --> 11:49.765
Yeah.

11:50.400 --> 11:51.469
So... (Clears throat)

11:51.470 --> 11:53.791
Ever track down
your missing boyfriend?

11:53.810 --> 11:57.632
Brooke! Are you joining us?

11:58.510 --> 12:03.447
Look, maybe I was unclear.
Go away.

12:03.880 --> 12:06.678
I'll take that as a "no."

12:07.320 --> 12:10.289
The way he looked at me,
i wanted to cry,

12:10.290 --> 12:11.712
but I also got really angry.

12:11.720 --> 12:13.711
That's probably natural, right?
That's a lot of history there.

12:13.730 --> 12:18.429
I don't know. I think
when Audrey went all doom
and gloom on me this morning,

12:18.430 --> 12:20.523
she really got into my head.

12:20.530 --> 12:21.997
I think something
is up with her.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.697
It's also Audrey.
It's hard to tell.

12:25.710 --> 12:28.964
You think your dad
will stick around?
I have no idea.

12:28.970 --> 12:31.905
He doesn't exactly have
the most reliable track record.

12:31.910 --> 12:33.775
My dad left us
when I was little.

12:33.780 --> 12:37.307
If he showed up now,
I'd probably punch him
in the teeth.

12:37.320 --> 12:40.278
Hey, fight club, not cool.

12:40.290 --> 12:42.850
You were listening
to all that?
No, no.

12:42.860 --> 12:47.752
Eli and his dad have
a complicated relationship.

12:47.760 --> 12:49.580
And Eli's crazy.

12:49.600 --> 12:53.457
I get it. I definitely wanted
to hit my dad when he left.

12:53.470 --> 12:56.564
I was little,
but I was so angry.

12:56.570 --> 12:58.561
That doesn't sound like you.

12:58.570 --> 13:01.300
I've got to cram
for my lit exam.

13:01.510 --> 13:04.263
PDA in the hallway.
It's adorable.

13:04.280 --> 13:06.805
Don't you have, like,
everything to sign up for?

13:06.810 --> 13:08.277
First day.
You got a lot to do.

13:08.280 --> 13:10.748
It is my first day.
I don't know where anything is.

13:10.750 --> 13:12.274
Okay? The cafeteria,
the office...

13:12.280 --> 13:14.589
I'll... I'll show him around.

13:14.590 --> 13:16.512
Are you sure?
Yeah.

13:16.520 --> 13:17.919
He's a pain in the ass.

13:17.920 --> 13:19.888
I'm standing right here.

13:19.890 --> 13:25.328
Just dump him at the office.
They'll take care of him.

13:28.030 --> 13:30.828
So, it must be weird
starting at a new school

13:30.840 --> 13:32.330
in the middle of the year.

13:32.340 --> 13:34.433
Used to it.
We move around a lot.

13:34.440 --> 13:40.902
Living in one place
your whole life isn't all
that it's cracked up to be.

13:43.080 --> 13:45.469
So, yesterday,
in the hall...

13:45.480 --> 13:48.711
Yeah. Right. I was wondering
when you'd bring that up.

13:48.720 --> 13:52.019
You knew who I was?
Yeah.

13:52.020 --> 13:54.818
And you chose to screw
with me because...?

13:54.830 --> 14:00.427
It was more fun
than "hey, I'm Eli."
"Hey, I'm Emma."

14:01.630 --> 14:05.589
Yeah, I guess that's more fun.

14:06.570 --> 14:10.028
You're still
kind of weird though.

14:12.950 --> 14:15.999
Whatever's on here might
make that murderboard
look like kiddie hour.

14:16.020 --> 14:19.012
Watch this.
Noah, we're gonna
be late for school.

14:19.020 --> 14:22.410
(Line ringing)
Shh! Shh, shh, shh.

14:22.620 --> 14:25.453
Crescent palms, your place
to relax in lakewood.

14:25.460 --> 14:26.711
This is Eddie. How can...?

14:26.730 --> 14:28.049
You think you're
pretty smart, huh?

14:28.060 --> 14:31.848
I want to know
who else you told
about that storage unit.

14:32.900 --> 14:34.561
Who is this?
Oh, come on.

14:34.570 --> 14:37.494
It's Noah foster
from the morgue.
We talked last night.

14:37.500 --> 14:40.765
I told you already, I don't
have anything else to say.

14:40.770 --> 14:43.864
(Muttering)
Oh, that's nice. Okay.

14:43.880 --> 14:48.601
Look, you're spinning out
these conspiracy theories
that just don't exist, man.

14:48.610 --> 14:52.376
Just wait for the camera
to sync up, okay?

14:53.620 --> 14:55.611
And... we are syncing.

14:55.620 --> 14:58.919
(Suspenseful music playing)

15:02.860 --> 15:05.556
We're almost a quarter synced.

15:10.070 --> 15:12.061
What are you hiding?

15:15.010 --> 15:18.434
We are almost there.

15:18.640 --> 15:21.029
Come on, come on, come on.
Oh, damn it!

15:21.050 --> 15:24.770
It was just streaming only.
There's nothing on here.

15:24.780 --> 15:27.669
Uh, careful with that.

15:27.950 --> 15:29.815
It's a bookend.
Very sturdy. It's fine.

15:29.820 --> 15:33.779
(Scoffs) Limited edition
dragon's head bookends
with faux onyx finish,

15:33.790 --> 15:38.489
and the only thing
keeping half my library
from sliding onto the floor.

15:38.500 --> 15:42.664
That's usually
what bookends do.

15:43.970 --> 15:48.134
I'm... I'm going to go to class.
I'll see you there?

15:59.050 --> 16:02.918
(Phone vibrating)

16:41.660 --> 16:45.391
I know you told me
not to come back.

16:45.400 --> 16:46.492
But here you are.

16:46.500 --> 16:49.799
I needed to see her.
So, you saw her.

16:49.800 --> 16:52.291
Hopefully, you could see
that she's a strong girl.

16:52.300 --> 16:54.131
She's working hard
to get back to her life.

16:54.140 --> 16:57.234
And I don't want to mess
any of that up.

16:57.240 --> 16:58.639
But she had questions.

16:58.640 --> 16:59.777
Questions...
(Scoffs)

16:59.780 --> 17:02.305
Questions like, uh...
"Why no letters or phone calls?"

17:02.310 --> 17:04.574
Or "where the hell
have you been half my life?"

17:04.580 --> 17:06.116
I don't want to fight.

17:06.120 --> 17:07.747
You should have
respected my wishes.

17:07.750 --> 17:08.887
I'm trying to protect her.

17:08.890 --> 17:11.381
When I found out
what happened to both of you,

17:11.390 --> 17:13.210
I knew I needed
to connect with her,

17:13.230 --> 17:16.154
because the same thing
happened to me, Maggie.

17:16.160 --> 17:17.149
Why are you here?

17:17.160 --> 17:18.696
Emma's friend Riley's
been reaching out to me.

17:18.700 --> 17:22.420
She told me
when Emma came home
from your mom's house,

17:22.430 --> 17:24.227
she thought Emma needed me.

17:24.240 --> 17:27.539
Not Riley marra.
Yeah.

17:27.540 --> 17:31.169
She's been emailing me. Here.

17:38.620 --> 17:41.271
Piper murdered Riley marra
months ago.

17:41.290 --> 17:45.283
You've been getting emails
from a dead girl.

17:48.890 --> 17:54.294
Okay, no, it's not a crush.
I'm just a little obsessed
with his podcast.

17:54.300 --> 17:55.369
(Chuckles)

17:55.370 --> 17:56.928
But he was with Riley.

17:56.940 --> 17:59.829
That was so sad.
Now, he's always with Audrey.

17:59.840 --> 18:01.899
Although,
after that video last fall,

18:01.910 --> 18:03.730
I guess guys aren't
really her thing.

18:03.740 --> 18:07.608
Did you see it? Who would
even post something like that?

18:07.610 --> 18:10.602
Mean people
who don't think.
In other news,

18:10.620 --> 18:13.612
I definitely think
there's something we can do

18:13.620 --> 18:14.917
about this whole
Noah situation.

18:14.920 --> 18:17.787
No, Brooke, please.
I really don't...
(Phone vibrates)

18:17.790 --> 18:21.419
Ugh, unknown numbers
drive me nuts. Hello?

18:21.430 --> 18:27.221
Man:
That in black ink,
my love may st/l/ shine bright.

18:28.300 --> 18:31.633
Okay, you are blocked
on all social media, phones,

18:31.640 --> 18:34.859
even the telegraph, Branson,
and you're blocked for a reason.

18:34.870 --> 18:38.579
I miss you, Brooke, and I heard
that you broke up with Jake,

18:38.580 --> 18:40.377
so I wanted to...
We're negotiating.

18:40.380 --> 18:45.613
And how do you know that?
And are you really opening
with a Shakespeare quote?

18:45.620 --> 18:48.987
Is that your plan?
Thats right. Sonnet 65.

18:48.990 --> 18:50.810
I assigned it.
I ’m feeling nostalgic.

18:50.820 --> 18:54.210
Come on, Brooke,
you don ’t miss me at all?

18:54.230 --> 18:57.449
Consider this number
blocked, too.

19:00.630 --> 19:04.293
This is my cousin, Eli.
Feel free to ignore him.

19:04.300 --> 19:05.858
This is Audrey, Noah.

19:05.870 --> 19:07.269
Hey, man. First day, huh?

19:07.270 --> 19:10.398
School is school.
Sure, except,
in this school,

19:10.410 --> 19:12.378
people get killed
by knife-wielding maniacs

19:12.380 --> 19:14.336
every 20 years,
give or take.

19:14.350 --> 19:18.468
_ Excuse me!
"Girl's only" moment.

19:22.020 --> 19:27.481
(Sighs) So, out of nowhere,
Branson hits me up this morning.

19:27.490 --> 19:31.722
Yeah. He said he just "heard"
Jake and I broke up.

19:31.730 --> 19:33.493
Whoa! How did he hear that?

19:33.500 --> 19:35.627
Barely anyone even knew
that you were together.

19:35.630 --> 19:40.829
What is it
with men from the past
mysteriously showing up?

19:41.040 --> 19:42.962
Wait, what does that mean?

19:42.980 --> 19:44.936
Emma's deadbeat dad
resurfaced, too.

19:44.940 --> 19:48.944
Okay, not cool. And that
is a totally different thing.

19:48.950 --> 19:51.510
And I was also not ready
to share that!

19:51.520 --> 19:54.318
You weren't gonna
share it with me?

19:54.320 --> 19:57.585
The person I told this morning
wasn't exactly supportive, so...

19:57.590 --> 20:00.718
And how was your breakfast
this morning?

20:00.730 --> 20:02.379
It went really well.

20:02.390 --> 20:05.496
I can tell
that's 100% not true.

20:05.500 --> 20:08.389
Okay, are you two,
like, legit fighting?

20:08.400 --> 20:09.765
No, it's fine.
It's just...

20:09.770 --> 20:13.297
Audrey has some
unflattering opinions
about my dad, that's all.

20:13.310 --> 20:15.403
No, they're memories,
not opinions.

20:15.410 --> 20:17.731
And, sometimes, maybe people
are going through big things

20:17.740 --> 20:20.903
that have absolutely nothing
to do with you, Emma.

20:20.910 --> 20:22.798
Big shocker!

20:24.720 --> 20:27.041
At the most,
it's identity theft.

20:27.050 --> 20:30.542
And, even then,
what's the real harm?

20:31.360 --> 20:34.488
I'm sorry, mag.
I-i didn't mean
to sound dismissive.

20:34.490 --> 20:37.653
It's just...
You've seen the reports
of all the hijinks

20:37.660 --> 20:39.855
since your unfortunate
run-in with Ms. Shaw.

20:39.870 --> 20:41.622
That's a pretty damning
understatement.

20:41.630 --> 20:44.565
Look, we all grew up here.
And you left. You both left.

20:44.570 --> 20:48.529
My family left because of that
whole Brandon James mess.

20:48.540 --> 20:50.667
Miguel, with our
particular history,

20:50.680 --> 20:52.739
I think you should investigate.

20:52.740 --> 20:54.799
(Sighs)

20:56.450 --> 20:59.044
You know what?
You're right. Just to be safe.

20:59.050 --> 21:02.679
I know a guy in the bureau
back in Phoenix.

21:02.690 --> 21:06.012
He can try to trace
the activity. Take a while.

21:06.020 --> 21:08.113
But, for now,
do not tell Emma.

21:08.130 --> 21:10.451
Okay? We don't need
the whole student body talking.

21:10.460 --> 21:13.691
I don't know about not
telling Emma. IfI don't...

21:13.700 --> 21:15.429
What if Miguel is right?

21:15.430 --> 21:18.831
You said you don't want
to stress Emma out.

21:22.980 --> 21:26.905
You let me know
if you find anything out.

21:28.480 --> 21:32.371
Maggie, hold up. I trust Miguel.
He'll get this sorted out.

21:32.380 --> 21:33.813
Like deciding
not to tell Emma,

21:33.820 --> 21:35.742
and then, swapping glances
like you're teenage boys

21:35.750 --> 21:38.548
getting away
with things again?
That's not what just happened.

21:38.560 --> 21:41.449
Look, I've raised Emma
on my own since you left.

21:41.460 --> 21:43.655
I've made mistakes,
but I didn't have any help.

21:43.660 --> 21:46.652
That's not fair.
You know I had to leave.
Now, you're back,

21:46.670 --> 21:48.991
and you think
that you and Emma
almost being killed

21:49.000 --> 21:52.390
is a good thing
to have in common.
It's something we share.

21:52.400 --> 21:55.938
Being attacked
by a psychopath
is not bonding!

21:57.710 --> 22:01.009
Don't you ever.

22:01.010 --> 22:06.778
(Door opens, closes)
(Faint police radio chatter)

22:08.850 --> 22:13.753
Can I get a copy of the schedule
for next week? Thanks.

22:13.760 --> 22:15.728
She looked at me
like I was crazy, too.

22:15.730 --> 22:20.520
I got a black eye. Iced coffee,
two shots of Espresso.

22:20.530 --> 22:22.964
I would never sleep again.
Right?

22:22.970 --> 22:24.426
(Both chuckle)

22:24.440 --> 22:27.898
Uh, so, earlier,
the punching comment...

22:27.910 --> 22:30.435
Sorry, if that was...
No, it's fine.

22:30.440 --> 22:31.566
I would punch my dad.

22:31.580 --> 22:33.571
I just felt kinda bad
for interrupting you.

22:33.580 --> 22:36.504
Here. Also, your dad called
and left you a message.

22:36.520 --> 22:40.616
It's on top there.
Maybe let him know
that cell phones exist

22:40.620 --> 22:42.212
and this isn't _
an answering servnce?

22:42.220 --> 22:47.010
Yeah. Sorry. Guess he
doesn't have my number.

22:47.030 --> 22:51.899
Anticipation builds.
What is the message
from Emma's dad?

22:52.660 --> 22:53.854
He's at the Crescent palms.

22:53.870 --> 22:58.933
He says he's sorry, and he has
an answer about why he left.

22:58.940 --> 23:02.899
That's good, right?
We'll see.

23:26.200 --> 23:29.590
You had a liquor store delivery
at the front desk.

23:29.600 --> 23:33.934
For a Mr. duval?
Found a corkscrew.

23:38.180 --> 23:42.276
Hello? Is anyone in here?

23:42.910 --> 23:44.707
Mr. duval?

23:50.020 --> 23:52.011
Excuse me.

23:57.760 --> 24:01.548
Plastic. Kinlq.

24:03.770 --> 24:05.294
Hello?

24:05.300 --> 24:07.860
(Water running)

24:15.680 --> 24:23.086
(Suspenseful music playing)

24:37.270 --> 24:38.897
Help!

24:40.140 --> 24:42.904
(Old-timey song playing)
I...

24:42.910 --> 24:48.234
(volume increasing)
I need your touch

24:48.250 --> 24:52.277
please! Somebody! Help!
I...

24:52.280 --> 24:57.183
want you so much
help!

25:04.660 --> 25:11.020
(Singing continues)

25:12.940 --> 25:19.379
Please come back

25:21.910 --> 25:25.676
(phone vibrating)

25:37.200 --> 25:39.191
You should be
a better partner, Audrey.

25:39.200 --> 25:41.998
I ’m doing all the work.
Just tell me what you want.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.093
I want you to ﬁnally
have some answers, k/l/er.

25:44.100 --> 25:45.988
They’re waiting for you
back at Crescent palms.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.059
No. (Scoffs)
No, I'm not going
anywhere, you freak.

25:48.070 --> 25:51.870
If you don ’t go now,
the video of you playing
with Jakes mangled body

25:51.880 --> 25:56.374
gets posted in the comments
of your friend ’5 podcast.

25:56.380 --> 25:58.712
Its up to you.

26:02.920 --> 26:07.459
Hey, Noah! You here
for some b-movie action?

26:07.460 --> 26:09.325
Yup, just meeting up
with some folks.

26:09.330 --> 26:12.891
If you have a second,
I've been listening
to the podcast.

26:12.900 --> 26:15.095
Oh, a fan of the morgue, huh?
Yeah.

26:15.100 --> 26:16.897
It sounds like you're
making real progress

26:16.900 --> 26:18.765
with this whole
Piper accomplice thing.

26:18.770 --> 26:20.089
Thank you.
You're welcome.

26:20.110 --> 26:23.807
I was just wondering...
What if you do find someone?

26:23.810 --> 26:30.045
Don't you think that he,
or she, or even they,
won't be happy about it?

26:30.050 --> 26:33.975
That means you get hurt.
Or worse.

26:35.120 --> 26:38.908
Okay. Okay,
food for thought.

26:38.920 --> 26:41.809
Uh-oh. Here comes trouble.

26:41.830 --> 26:43.252
Brooke: Here we are!

26:43.260 --> 26:44.454
Oh, hey!

26:44.460 --> 26:45.495
Did you invite him?

26:45.500 --> 26:47.798
No. Uh, where's everyone else?

26:47.800 --> 26:52.191
Oh, it's just me. And Zoe.
You two know each other, right?

26:52.200 --> 26:55.260
Yes, yeah,
a little bit. Ish.
Kind of. Yeah.

26:55.270 --> 26:58.034
(All chuckle)

26:59.310 --> 27:02.404
Um, so, did you do the reading
for ap English yet?

27:02.410 --> 27:04.002
0f mice and men.
Wow. Oh, my god.

27:04.020 --> 27:08.218
In what world
does strangling a rabbit
get you a bullet to the head?

27:08.220 --> 27:09.949
Ah, spoiler alert.
I didn't actually...

27:09.960 --> 27:12.178
Oh, my god. I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to ruin it
for you.

27:12.190 --> 27:13.919
That's okay.
It doesn't matter.

27:13.930 --> 27:15.955
I'm just gonna speed
this up a little bit.

27:15.960 --> 27:18.849
Noah, if you're smart,
you'll ask Zoe out.

27:18.860 --> 27:23.024
And if you're luclq,
she'll say yes. Right?

27:23.030 --> 27:24.429
Yay!

27:24.440 --> 27:27.830
And what are you doing here?
Just seeing a movie.

27:27.840 --> 27:30.468
Something I can do
for you, or...?

27:30.480 --> 27:33.938
Could I get just
one stavo-free day?

27:33.950 --> 27:35.247
Do you have any of those?

27:35.250 --> 27:39.175
Yeah, the thing is,
we're all out of that.

27:39.180 --> 27:41.774
(Both snicker)

27:41.790 --> 27:43.280
Let's go.

27:46.220 --> 27:47.812
Who thought you'd
be so excited to see

27:47.830 --> 27:49.957
k/l/er k/owns
from outer space?

27:49.960 --> 27:51.359
God, is that
what we're seeing?

27:51.360 --> 27:54.921
Audrey said she was going
to sneak us in tonight, right?

27:54.930 --> 27:57.364
But she's not here.

27:57.370 --> 27:59.190
She's been m.I.A.
A lot lately.

27:59.200 --> 28:02.260
Man: Can I get
a small popcorn?

28:05.540 --> 28:10.204
Who's that guy?
That is Mr. Branson.
He used to teach at gwh.

28:10.220 --> 28:14.111
Yeah, he used to do
a lot of things.

28:16.090 --> 28:17.887
(Clears throat)

28:18.190 --> 28:22.251
I know what you're thinking,
but this is... this is
totally a coincidence.

28:22.260 --> 28:25.354
Oh, right, yeah.
You unknown call me
this morning,

28:25.360 --> 28:28.056
and then you just happen
to show up here?

28:28.070 --> 28:30.220
I see you
a lot of places in town.

28:30.240 --> 28:31.491
I avoid you
so you don't know.

28:31.500 --> 28:33.536
Well, that's not
a smart thing to say.

28:33.540 --> 28:37.408
"PS. I see you,
but you don't see me."

28:37.410 --> 28:40.538
Do you...
Do you, like, actually think
that I'm stalking you?

28:40.550 --> 28:42.575
You've absolutely
misled me before.

28:42.580 --> 28:45.970
If you don't think
what we had was real,
there's nothing I can do.

28:45.980 --> 28:48.039
Your name wasn't real,
your backstory wasn't real.

28:48.050 --> 28:53.181
Your history of not dating girls
who wind up dead wasn't real.

28:53.190 --> 28:58.184
Is that why you locked me
out of your house
while people were dying?

28:58.200 --> 28:59.428
I don't trust you.

28:59.430 --> 29:01.523
You never even gave me
a chance to explain.

29:01.530 --> 29:03.418
You just shut me out.

29:03.440 --> 29:09.106
Brooke, it wasn't just sex.
I still care about you.

29:10.280 --> 29:11.167
(Sighs)

29:11.180 --> 29:13.432
We can at least
finish talking.

29:13.450 --> 29:16.078
Hey, Mr. Branson.

29:16.080 --> 29:18.605
Oh, this is not
at all uncomfortable.

29:18.620 --> 29:21.316
Any new missing girls
to report?

29:21.320 --> 29:23.538
(Scoffs)
I never liked you, foster.

29:23.560 --> 29:25.141
Hey, no need for that, boys.

29:25.160 --> 29:29.620
Your, um... your sources
were correct about Jake.

29:29.630 --> 29:31.518
It's... it's complicated.

29:31.530 --> 29:34.419
But, in the meantime,
I'm keeping my plate full.

29:34.430 --> 29:36.569
This is my new friend, stavo.

29:36.570 --> 29:40.267
He's the sheriff's son.
So, be nice.

29:40.270 --> 29:42.101
Is this old dude
bothering you?

29:42.110 --> 29:45.898
(Scoffs)
You're not dating this guy.

29:49.010 --> 29:51.046
Babe, if we're gonna
see the movie,

29:51.050 --> 29:53.348
we should get in there.

29:56.420 --> 29:58.479
(Clears throat)
You know, um,
on second thought,

29:58.490 --> 30:02.085
I'm not stoked about sitting
in a dark room with a teacher.

30:02.090 --> 30:06.151
Let's just find
something else to do, guys.

30:08.430 --> 30:09.590
You've changed, Brooke.

30:09.600 --> 30:13.092
You didn't even
say "thank you"
for the flowers.

30:15.440 --> 30:19.228
What flowers?
The ones I left on your car?

30:24.020 --> 30:25.669
Brooke:
Let's go.

30:50.380 --> 30:52.063
(Dings)

30:52.080 --> 30:57.006
Hello?
Uh, is anyone back there?

30:58.020 --> 30:59.476
Hello?

31:39.420 --> 31:42.457
Dad? Are you in there?

31:46.560 --> 31:50.269
Dad? I got your message.

32:02.250 --> 32:05.378
(Door squeaks, closes)

32:11.760 --> 32:15.628
(Suspenseful music playing)

32:22.370 --> 32:25.225
(Ringtone playing)

32:25.240 --> 32:26.366
Hey, Noah. What's up?

32:26.370 --> 32:27.667
Why aren't you
at work tonight?

32:27.670 --> 32:29.160
Why are you
a private detective?

32:29.170 --> 32:31.468
It's a secret. If I tell you,
I'll have to kill you.

32:31.480 --> 32:33.175
Cryptic.
You'll have to get in line.

32:33.180 --> 32:37.173
Stavo thinks looking
for Piper's accomplice might
put me on someone's death list.

32:37.180 --> 32:40.718
Huh. Good job, stavo.
Are you really just now
realizing this?

32:40.720 --> 32:42.312
I was here
with Brooke and Zoe.

32:42.320 --> 32:43.810
We were hoping
you could sneak us in.

32:43.820 --> 32:45.447
But then,
Mr. Branson showed up.

32:45.460 --> 32:47.314
I ’m in the middle
of something, Noah.

32:47.330 --> 32:49.150
Just fill me in later.

32:49.160 --> 32:53.529
Are you okay? You sound...
I ’m golden. I have to run.

32:56.370 --> 32:58.224
Missing in action.

32:58.240 --> 33:00.800
(Ringtone playing)
(Sighs)

33:00.810 --> 33:04.302
Okay, Noah, seriously, you've
been excessively clingy today!

33:04.310 --> 33:05.800
I told you...
Voice:
I can’t help it.

33:05.810 --> 33:08.506
Its so much fun Imag/n/ng
how your insides would look

33:08.510 --> 33:11.274
on the end of my buck knife.
That's not exactly enticing.

33:11.280 --> 33:14.738
Don ’t worry.
Its just a fantasy.
I 5177/ need your helo.

33:14.750 --> 33:17.844
I'm almost there.
Better hurry.
We have a guest.

33:17.860 --> 33:20.784
(Chuckles, hangs up)
A guest? Wait, what guest?

33:20.790 --> 33:24.419
(Ringtone playing,
phone vibrating)

33:27.830 --> 33:30.867
(Suspenseful music playing)

33:30.870 --> 33:32.497
Emma...

33:43.920 --> 33:48.277
(Car horn honking,
tires screeching)

33:48.290 --> 33:49.939
Holy crap!

33:49.950 --> 33:52.316
(Panﬂng)

33:54.630 --> 33:57.258
(Line ringing)
Okay, come on.

33:57.260 --> 33:59.820
Come on, come on, come on.

34:01.270 --> 34:03.693
(Phone ringing)

34:08.940 --> 34:11.807
Hey, it’s Emma.
You missed me. Send a text.

34:11.810 --> 34:14.438
Answer your phone!
(Line beeps)

34:15.710 --> 34:17.803
(Exhales)

34:20.950 --> 34:24.386
Lakewood city services 91.7.
What IS the nature
of your emergency?

34:24.390 --> 34:26.915
You need to send someone
over to the Crescent palms
motel right now.

34:26.920 --> 34:29.821
My friend is in danger
and she needs help!
Okay, ma ’am, stay calm.

34:29.830 --> 34:33.322
I am calm!
You need to send someone
over there right now. Please!

34:33.330 --> 34:38.597
Officers wﬂ/ respond.
May I please have your name
for purposes. . .

34:43.940 --> 34:47.398
(water running)

35:05.030 --> 35:06.622
Woman:
Stop it.I
(Glass shattering)

35:06.630 --> 35:09.622
M a n :
Would you just listen?

35:09.900 --> 35:11.697
Man:
Where do you think
you're going?

35:11.700 --> 35:13.588
Woman:
Keep your hands off of me!

35:13.600 --> 35:17.536
Man: don't you dare leave!
Woman: Go to hell!

35:23.380 --> 35:25.974
Kevin: You think you can
deny people service?

35:25.980 --> 35:27.572
Man:
I'm required to.

35:27.590 --> 35:30.388
You're drunk.
Go home before it gets ugly.

35:30.390 --> 35:34.508
Kevin: Just because
i had a few drinks?
Is that what you think?

35:34.530 --> 35:38.955
Dad?
You don't know the things
that I've seen, son of a bitch.

35:38.960 --> 35:44.489
Don't put your hands on me.
Don't put your hands on me!

35:46.600 --> 35:49.706
Please stop. Dad, stop it!

35:51.340 --> 35:53.069
Dad, stop!

36:01.690 --> 36:03.419
Oh, thank god.

36:15.230 --> 36:17.721
Emma, I don't know
what happened.

36:17.740 --> 36:19.367
Um...
(Sighs)

36:19.370 --> 36:22.134
You're drunk?
No.

36:22.340 --> 36:24.399
Yeah, a little bit,
but my temper...

36:24.410 --> 36:29.109
Why did you ask me to come here
and then get wasted?

36:30.250 --> 36:33.845
Why were these
in your motel room?
Were you...?

36:33.850 --> 36:37.047
Were you at the farm
on pikeview road
the other day?

36:37.050 --> 36:40.178
Look, I don't know
what you're saying.

36:40.190 --> 36:41.259
Those aren't mine.

36:41.260 --> 36:44.229
I checked out.
Everything's in my car.

36:44.230 --> 36:47.495
You... you didn't
leave me that message?

36:47.500 --> 36:50.492
No, no.

36:53.100 --> 36:54.988
Wait, you...

36:56.240 --> 36:58.060
You were leaving?

36:58.080 --> 37:00.469
You were leaving again
without explaining anything?

37:00.480 --> 37:03.142
Please, please...
Just stay over there!

37:03.150 --> 37:04.344
Don't be scared of me, okay?

37:04.350 --> 37:07.319
That's the whole reason
why, Emma...

37:07.320 --> 37:08.844
Listen...
(Sighs)

37:08.850 --> 37:13.059
Living through what happened
to me... to us... it changes you.

37:13.060 --> 37:17.986
Okay? But you know that.
It just... it made me angry.

37:18.000 --> 37:23.427
And then,
i started drinking more
and I just made things worse.

37:23.430 --> 37:25.261
Oh...

37:25.800 --> 37:28.963
Especially for... your mom.

37:28.970 --> 37:33.236
One day, I was drunk.
I was trying to take you
somewhere in the car,

37:33.240 --> 37:36.846
and she tried to stop me,
and I just lost control,

37:36.850 --> 37:40.377
and I... attacked her.

37:40.380 --> 37:43.213
I fractured her jaw.
(Crymg)

37:43.220 --> 37:48.988
She was so frightened...
Of putting you in danger.

37:50.160 --> 37:51.229
(Sighs)

37:51.230 --> 37:54.154
I never wanted you
to see me like this.

37:54.170 --> 37:55.523
You hurt mom?

37:55.530 --> 37:58.067
I was so thankful
that she never told you,

37:58.070 --> 38:01.858
that she let you
remember me better.

38:05.840 --> 38:08.138
Audrey, what are you...?
What are you doing here?

38:08.150 --> 38:13.213
I was... I was
driving by and I, uh...
(Police siren blaring)

38:15.590 --> 38:18.218
It doesn't matter.
Are you okay?

38:18.220 --> 38:21.257
Did someone here
call the police?

38:21.260 --> 38:24.127
Idid. Um, I saw
these guys fighting,

38:24.130 --> 38:28.089
and I thought my friend
might be in danger.

38:29.230 --> 38:30.629
You called the police?

38:30.640 --> 38:35.259
It was intense,
and I didn't know
It was your dad.

38:35.270 --> 38:38.433
Step over here with me
for a moment.

38:41.010 --> 38:44.946
I... I need
to get out of here.

38:48.250 --> 38:50.184
My mom was right.
You were right.

38:50.190 --> 38:53.489
(Takes deep breath)
I am sorry.

38:53.490 --> 38:56.288
No, don't apologize.
I was a jerk.

38:56.290 --> 38:59.396
I can't explain why.
None of it matters right now.

38:59.400 --> 39:04.224
He said that we're the same.
I don't want to be the same.

39:04.240 --> 39:06.333
Emma, you're not.

39:08.610 --> 39:11.636
You don't always have
to rescue me.

39:11.640 --> 39:16.202
It's not like
i do it on purpose.
(Chuckles)

39:17.250 --> 39:22.017
Get home safe, okay?
Yeah, I will.

39:25.220 --> 39:28.314
(Sighs)
(Car engine starts)

39:39.340 --> 39:41.160
(Sighs)

39:41.170 --> 39:43.229
(Phone vibrates)

40:09.300 --> 40:14.363
(Hyperventilating)
