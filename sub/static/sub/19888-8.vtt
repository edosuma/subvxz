18:16.563 --> 18:17.730
then I will see it done.

18:27.640 --> 18:29.108
Why do you trust him?

18:29.576 --> 18:31.244
I don't trust anyone.

18:32.479 --> 18:34.381
But if he kills Quinn,

18:34.414 --> 18:37.116
then we win the war
without risking our own men.

18:53.566 --> 18:53.900
(BABY COOING)

19:27.567 --> 19:28.601
QUINN: Mmm?

19:30.270 --> 19:31.904
Now, cheer up. Hmm?

19:31.938 --> 19:33.906
We have much to celebrate.

19:33.940 --> 19:36.243
And what on Earth
would we be celebrating?

19:36.643 --> 19:38.245
My impending demise.

19:39.312 --> 19:40.613
(INHALES SHARPLY) Mmm?

19:41.481 --> 19:42.815
Now, don't be coy, Veil.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.552
(SLURPS) Hmm.

19:47.820 --> 19:50.457
All those treatments
I underwent, hmm?

19:51.391 --> 19:53.693
You knew they were
a waste of time, didn't you?

19:54.394 --> 19:55.528
Hmm?

19:57.297 --> 20:00.433
That wasn't even the full
extent of your duplicity, hmm?

20:00.467 --> 20:01.634
Poor Edgar.

20:05.938 --> 20:06.973
You'll be pleased to know

20:07.006 --> 20:09.509
that your recent escapade
wasn't entirely futile.

20:09.542 --> 20:11.278
It sparked an epiphany.

20:12.545 --> 20:14.747
I realized that
the safest place for our boy

20:14.781 --> 20:15.948
is with me.

20:15.982 --> 20:17.384
(COOING)

20:17.417 --> 20:19.352
Henry must never leave
my sight again.

20:21.754 --> 20:22.922
Henry's not your son.

20:22.955 --> 20:24.557
(GRUNTS) Yes, not yet.

20:25.057 --> 20:27.694
That's an error I intend
to rectify post haste.

20:29.429 --> 20:30.830
And what does that mean?

20:33.300 --> 20:35.935
My intention is to make Henry
my rightful heir.

20:40.973 --> 20:43.543
Veil and I are to be married.

20:44.844 --> 20:46.279
You...

20:46.313 --> 20:48.047
You can't be serious.

20:48.080 --> 20:51.017
Time is precious and I have
none to waste. Hmm.

20:51.918 --> 20:53.686
Before I go to my grave,

20:53.720 --> 20:54.754
I will ensure

20:54.787 --> 20:57.023
that Henry is entitled
to everything that's mine.

20:57.824 --> 20:59.692
It will be my legacy.

20:59.726 --> 21:01.561
Have a look around.

21:01.594 --> 21:03.396
Your legacy
consists of nothing

21:03.430 --> 21:05.031
but this filthy rat hole.

21:05.998 --> 21:08.368
Now, jealousy
doesn't suit you, Lydia.

21:08.868 --> 21:10.870
Oh, I thought
even you had limits.

21:10.903 --> 21:12.372
I'm a Baron

21:12.405 --> 21:15.041
and I'm entitled
to as many wives as I want.

21:17.977 --> 21:20.980
Marriage is a union. Hmm?

21:22.615 --> 21:25.952
And we will be just that. Hmm.

21:27.119 --> 21:28.521
Unified.

21:29.622 --> 21:30.723
Now, I know,

21:30.757 --> 21:33.760
I know you disapprove
of me now. Hmm?

21:35.562 --> 21:36.929
We'll be a family.

21:38.665 --> 21:39.666
Hmm?

21:42.535 --> 21:44.904
This is how it's gonna be
from now on until the end.

21:44.937 --> 21:46.873
We will raise Henry together.

21:48.741 --> 21:49.776
All of us.

21:51.378 --> 21:52.612
I'll never go along with this.

21:52.645 --> 21:54.547
Nonsense.
You'll do as you're told,

21:54.581 --> 21:57.650
unless you prefer that
I raise Henry alone.

Meat's getting cold.

22:14.834 --> 22:15.968
Beautiful, Henry.

22:17.437 --> 22:20.407
That lying,
backstabbing son of a bitch!

22:21.508 --> 22:23.410
After everything I did
for him.

22:23.443 --> 22:24.777
Huh. It's unbelievable.

22:24.811 --> 22:26.513
Hey,
I'll tell you another thing.

22:26.546 --> 22:29.081
I am never putting my neck out
for anyone ever again.

22:29.782 --> 22:31.618
Yeah, I've learned my lesson.

22:31.651 --> 22:33.453
The only person I'm gonna be
looking out for...

22:33.486 --> 22:36.389
(WHISTLES) This guy, me.
Oh, yeah.

22:36.423 --> 22:37.424

Oh, I'm so sorry, you sweet...

22:46.466 --> 22:48.935
(KISSES) Beautiful, Clipper.

22:48.968 --> 22:50.703
Hey. What's that?

22:51.671 --> 22:52.805
(CHUCKLES)

22:53.573 --> 22:55.408

of a female voice.

24:37.309 --> 24:38.144
Mother.

24:38.177 --> 24:40.813
I know.
You're angry at me about Veil.

24:41.681 --> 24:43.750
Well, it was the only way to
form an alliance with Quinn.

24:43.783 --> 24:44.984
(EXHALES)

24:45.017 --> 24:47.219
THE WIDOW:
Well, but the truth, uh,

24:47.253 --> 24:49.822
the truth is
I also wanted to punish her.

24:51.323 --> 24:52.592
For what?

24:52.625 --> 24:54.026
Trying to turn you against me.

24:54.060 --> 24:55.528
You're everything to me,
Tilda.

24:55.562 --> 24:56.629
I hope that you know that.

24:56.663 --> 24:57.830
That doesn't change
what you did.

24:58.965 --> 25:00.900
How many of your sisters
did we save

25:00.933 --> 25:03.536
because Quinn's forces
are leading the charge?

25:03.570 --> 25:06.806
If the cost of that
is sacrificing one person

25:06.839 --> 25:09.842
who had no allegiance
to our cause, then so be it.

25:12.745 --> 25:13.746
(DOOR OPENING)

25:14.581 --> 25:15.615
(GRUNTING)

25:15.648 --> 25:17.183
We caught one
of Chau's Clippers.

25:17.216 --> 25:18.718
Says he's defecting.

25:19.652 --> 25:20.887
A defector?

25:22.789 --> 25:23.990
Why did you leave Chau?

25:25.858 --> 25:27.727
I'm not the only one.

25:27.760 --> 25:29.696
All her Cogs are fleeing.

25:29.729 --> 25:31.864
They know
she can't win this war.

25:31.898 --> 25:33.700
Hmm. I appreciate your candor

25:33.733 --> 25:36.669
but betraying a Baron
doesn't exactly speak

25:36.703 --> 25:38.004
of an honest heart.

25:40.139 --> 25:43.042
I want the truth.
Why did you flee?

25:43.075 --> 25:44.276
Chau is desperate.

25:45.011 --> 25:47.113
She's so low on weapons,

25:47.146 --> 25:49.716
she's even trading a boy
to the River King

25:49.749 --> 25:51.718
in the hope
he'll resupply her.

25:51.751 --> 25:53.085
-A boy?
-Yeah.

25:54.153 --> 25:56.989
For months, the River King's
been hunting him.

25:57.023 --> 25:59.759
Rumor is
he's some kind of demon.

his eyes go black.

through the ceremony,

26:53.846 --> 26:55.214
but I will not,

26:56.148 --> 26:58.918
I will not consummate
this sham

my parents. I won't.

27:01.320 --> 27:03.422

27:03.455 --> 27:05.792
No. You can't do that.

to take their revenge.

27:22.208 --> 27:24.410
I can't. I can't. (CRYING)

27:27.213 --> 27:28.380
(WHISPERING) You can.

27:29.015 --> 27:30.950
And once we're done,

with Chau

27:51.738 --> 27:52.772
and sell me to The Widow?

Keep it down.

27:56.208 --> 27:58.845
Right, you're a Regent again.

27:59.211 --> 28:00.947
Gotta follow orders.

28:01.914 --> 28:04.183
Look, I didn't rescue you
from the Abbots

28:04.216 --> 28:05.818
just to sell you to The Widow.

36:58.484 --> 36:59.818
Look, we both want
the same thing.

37:00.752 --> 37:01.987
Quinn dead.

37:02.020 --> 37:03.955
Let's finish what you started.

37:07.593 --> 37:08.660
He's underground.

37:09.595 --> 37:10.829
THE WIDOW:
I'll show you where.

37:18.904 --> 37:20.706
(TAKING DEEP BREATH)

37:27.979 --> 37:29.014
(GRUNTING)

37:37.323 --> 37:38.824
(INHALES DEEPLY)

38:06.418 --> 38:07.786
(BABY CRYING)

38:08.420 --> 38:11.557
(LOYALISTS
CHATTERING NDISTINCTLY)

38:13.492 --> 38:14.993
(BABY CONTINUES TO CRY)

38:15.026 --> 38:16.495
(SHUSHING)

38:35.547 --> 38:37.749
(LOYALISTS
CHATTERING NDISTINCTLY)

38:46.124 --> 38:47.493
(LAUGHING)

39:15.153 --> 39:17.456
Lydia and the baby are gone.

39:26.598 --> 39:28.099
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

39:42.448 --> 39:44.049

39:49.087 --> 39:50.689
-(GASPS)
-(GRUNTS)

39:50.722 --> 39:52.057
-(BABY CRYING)
-Gotcha.

39:52.090 --> 39:53.659
-(CACKLING)
-Let us go.

39:53.692 --> 39:55.494
GABRIEL: I have news!

39:56.595 --> 39:58.864
Sir, there was an ambush
by Chau's Clippers.

39:59.465 --> 40:00.666
Sunny was leading them.

40:01.533 --> 40:02.868
-Sunny?
-It was him

40:02.901 --> 40:04.069
that left with The Widow.

40:04.102 --> 40:05.837
-The Baron must be told.
-Not now.

40:05.871 --> 40:07.839
This can't wait.
He needs to know.

40:07.873 --> 40:09.641
He needs to know now.

40:20.886 --> 40:22.854
(QUINN INHALING DEEPLY)

40:31.830 --> 40:33.632
Quinn? Quinn.

40:34.132 --> 40:36.201
Have you no self-respect,
woman?

40:36.234 --> 40:38.203
LYDIA: I'm sorry,
but this news can't wait.

40:38.236 --> 40:39.771
It's Sunny.

40:40.138 --> 40:41.172
He's back.

40:41.740 --> 40:45.176
Sunny? How can that be?

40:45.210 --> 40:47.513
LYDIA: (PANTING) The report.

40:47.546 --> 40:48.980
He's joined forces
with The Widow

40:49.014 --> 40:51.149
and he's no doubt coming
to find you.

40:54.920 --> 40:56.187
(PANTING)

40:59.057 --> 41:00.492
(PANTING)

41:04.896 --> 41:06.131
(SOBBING)

41:06.164 --> 41:07.533
Give me...

41:09.601 --> 41:10.702
(VEIL SIGHING)

41:15.306 --> 41:16.808
He's alive.

41:19.911 --> 41:22.213
(SHUDDERING)
He's alive.
