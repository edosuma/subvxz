I don't know
how he's doing it.

00:52.486 --> 00:54.886
Sinestro's ring should be
drained dry by now.

-No power. No protection.

01:08.802 --> 01:10.502
What do you have left, Hal?

01:10.537 --> 01:12.370
A charming personality,
a great haircut,

01:12.405 --> 01:14.506
and abs so good, you can
wash your clothes on them.

01:21.214 --> 01:22.814
What's the plan?

01:22.849 --> 01:24.216
Superman and I distract him

So how come
you need to recharge
and he doesn't?

03:07.721 --> 03:10.622
It seems like his ring
is more powerful
than it's ever been.

03:10.657 --> 03:12.591
We need to find out
how he's doing it.

03:12.626 --> 03:15.928
Hey, get me close enough
and I'll get inside
