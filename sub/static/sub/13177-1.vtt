01:02.760 --> 01:04.062
What's one about?

01:04.262 --> 01:05.396
It's a comedy ma'am.

01:05.495 --> 01:06.698
It's a comedy?

01:06.764 --> 01:10.168
Comedy, comedy

01:10.268 --> 01:11.469
Is it funny?

01:11.535 --> 01:12.503
I don't know ma'am.
I haven't seen it.

01:12.838 --> 01:14.106
He hasn't seen it.

01:14.573 --> 01:15.506
Hasn't seen it?

01:15.507 --> 01:16.675
No, no.

01:16.740 --> 01:18.710
I hope there's
no swearing in it.

01:18.776 --> 01:19.977
I don't want swearing.

01:19.978 --> 01:21.846
No, there's no swearing in it.

01:21.847 --> 01:23.047
She hates swearing.

01:23.181 --> 01:24.482
I'm not sure ma'am.

01:24.650 --> 01:26.017
I can ask the manager.

01:26.217 --> 01:28.353
He's gonna go ask the manager.

01:28.753 --> 01:31.088
Ask the manager? No swearing.

01:31.089 --> 01:31.957
No swearing.

01:32.023 --> 01:33.692
For fuck's sake.

01:52.276 --> 01:53.811
We need
to talk, Barbara.

02:06.058 --> 02:08.127
Hey guys, could you turn
off your phone please?

02:13.966 --> 02:15.200
Are you, Barbara?

02:16.801 --> 02:18.603
Who is this Mr. Stick?

02:26.444 --> 02:29.080
Hey guys, could please
turn off the phone?

02:29.181 --> 02:30.516
Thank you.

02:32.283 --> 02:34.719
Come in.

02:42.827 --> 02:44.195
Come on guys, come on.

02:45.563 --> 02:46.998
I'm trying to watch
a movie, all right?

02:47.131 --> 02:48.666
Please just turn it off.

02:48.766 --> 02:50.635
Hey shut off your
own phone jackoff.

02:50.736 --> 02:51.904
We paid to watch the movie too.

02:52.037 --> 02:53.337
Yeah, well you're
not watching it.

02:53.571 --> 02:55.908
Hey, who are you old
man the local movie cop?

02:56.408 --> 02:57.509
Kiss my ass.

04:14.186 --> 04:16.387
Mr. Lee, I can check the
replacement unit in the morning.

04:16.487 --> 04:17.555
Check
it now Johnson.

04:17.988 --> 04:19.223
No morning, too late.

04:19.224 --> 04:20.659
It's almost five o'clock.

04:20.724 --> 04:22.895
You said it
Johnson, almost five o'clock.

04:23.094 --> 04:24.595
So get working.

04:24.897 --> 04:27.065
Yes, sir. Okay.

04:27.698 --> 04:30.468
Dammit, son of a

04:45.616 --> 04:48.452
I told that bitch to get
her own set of paper clips.

04:49.820 --> 04:54.092
My god it's not like I'm
being paid to babysit her.

04:55.661 --> 05:00.666
Yes, yes.

05:20.385 --> 05:25.089
Exactly, exactly.

05:25.757 --> 05:27.759
That cow needs to get a life.

05:28.760 --> 05:30.796
No, no one respects
her up there.

05:31.830 --> 05:34.399
Even corporate is
losing patience

05:34.464 --> 05:35.267
Ma'am.

05:35.332 --> 05:36.867
I'm trying to tell you

05:36.868 --> 05:38.069
I can't stand that lady
Excuse me ma'am.

05:38.070 --> 05:39.303
They get on my nerves.

05:39.637 --> 05:40.539
Excuse me.

05:40.540 --> 05:41.805
I promise you

05:41.806 --> 05:42.540
I think I'm having

05:43.642 --> 05:44.710
Not at all.

06:53.349 --> 06:56.005
<b>STRESSED TO KILL</b>

06:58.559 --> 07:01.559
<b>Subrip: Pix</b>

08:00.544 --> 08:01.678
Well, you certainly
look a lot better

08:01.679 --> 08:03.447
than you did the
last time I saw you.

08:04.349 --> 08:05.550
How you feeling?

08:05.616 --> 08:07.884
Lucky, apparently
you removed an elephant

08:07.885 --> 08:09.653
that was sitting on my chest.

08:10.255 --> 08:13.859
Interesting analogy,
I suppose I did.

08:15.993 --> 08:17.462
Thanks for saving
my life, doc.

08:18.363 --> 08:19.898
Well, you're
welcome, Mr. Johnson,

08:20.097 --> 08:21.799
but you know you're
not out of danger yet.

08:22.166 --> 08:25.703
I know, but you believe
me this was a wake up call.

08:26.137 --> 08:29.139
Yes, it was, and you
can choose to blow it off

08:29.140 --> 08:31.510
as a bump in the road
like a lot of guys do.

08:32.176 --> 08:34.078
I promise ya it'd be a mistake.

08:34.946 --> 08:36.181
What do you do for a living?

08:36.615 --> 08:38.750
Inspecting and install
fire safety equipment.

08:40.049 --> 08:41.452
Do you like your job?

08:41.885 --> 08:43.587
Better than being stuck
in an office all day.

08:44.020 --> 08:47.191
I hear that, but
is it stressful?

08:48.726 --> 08:51.562
For the most part
no, outdoors on my own.

08:51.563 --> 08:52.630
It's good work.

08:53.965 --> 08:55.200
Well, do you have any hobbies?

08:55.366 --> 08:56.300
What do you like to do?

08:57.235 --> 08:58.236
I like to travel.

08:59.303 --> 09:00.472
We used to do that a lot.

09:01.972 --> 09:03.541
My wife has other interests now.

09:04.042 --> 09:05.043
I see

09:08.746 --> 09:10.481
It's 156 over 118.

09:12.983 --> 09:14.251
Is that bad?

09:14.586 --> 09:16.821
Well, let's just say
if it gets any higher,

09:16.822 --> 09:18.356
you could be
visiting the morgue.

09:20.458 --> 09:22.059
What do the numbers mean?

09:23.260 --> 09:24.762
Well the top number
is the pressure

09:24.763 --> 09:26.598
in your arteries
when your beats.

09:26.932 --> 09:28.133
The bottom number
is the pressure

09:28.134 --> 09:29.934
between beats when
your heart's at rest.

09:30.769 --> 09:32.903
If you want to see another
set of birthday candles,

09:32.904 --> 09:35.373
you're gonna have to get
these numbers way down.

09:36.174 --> 09:39.477
120 over 80 ideally, a
little higher's acceptable.

09:40.645 --> 09:42.312
Tell me if you had to pinpoint

09:42.313 --> 09:45.049
the persistent stresses
in your life right now,

09:45.683 --> 09:47.184
what would you say?

09:48.185 --> 09:52.556
I guess people.

09:54.458 --> 09:55.693
Yeah people.

09:57.761 --> 09:59.330
A lot of assholes
out there, doc.

10:01.198 --> 10:02.534
Sometimes I can't take it.

10:04.602 --> 10:05.603
I understand, Bill.

10:06.270 --> 10:07.438
Hell I agree with ya.

10:08.106 --> 10:09.640
But you gotta learn
to get along them

10:09.941 --> 10:12.009
as hard as that may
seem, and you need

10:12.010 --> 10:14.745
to identify and get the
more persistent ones

10:14.746 --> 10:16.047
out of your life completely.

10:17.381 --> 10:18.717
How do you suggest I do that?

10:19.818 --> 10:21.019
It's not easy to say.

10:21.620 --> 10:22.787
Be creative.

10:23.288 --> 10:24.556
I'm sure you'll come
up with something.

10:24.890 --> 10:26.258
I want you to take
your blood pressure

10:26.259 --> 10:27.625
every day and record it.

10:28.226 --> 10:29.727
That'll tell ya if
it's working or not.

10:32.396 --> 10:34.231
All right, okay, I'm on it.

10:35.232 --> 10:36.166
Thanks doc.

10:47.913 --> 10:51.249
Bill, you do not
need that much butter.

10:51.882 --> 10:54.785
I'm not one of your
fatass clients, Vera.

10:54.885 --> 10:56.087
Give me my toast!

10:56.187 --> 10:58.255
No, but you don't
need that much fat.

11:04.728 --> 11:07.765
You know you're headed for
another heart attack, Bill,

11:07.866 --> 11:09.500
if you don't change your ways.

11:26.483 --> 11:27.918
Thank you.

11:30.621 --> 11:33.058
I cannot believe that you
drink those shakes dude.

11:33.857 --> 11:36.260
They're terrible.

11:36.595 --> 11:37.529
I had the strawberry.

11:37.530 --> 11:39.664
Tasted like an old sock, Billy.

11:40.832 --> 11:42.534
Wouldn't even feed
that to my dog.

11:42.701 --> 11:44.100
Can't even clean
the floor with it.

11:44.101 --> 11:45.337
I don't know how
the hell you do it.

11:47.204 --> 11:48.972
What do

11:48.973 --> 11:50.775
you mean you want
to see other people?

11:52.209 --> 11:53.744
Are you breaking up with me?

11:54.813 --> 11:58.082
My God, this has never
happened to me before.

11:58.582 --> 11:59.384
Really?

11:59.583 --> 12:00.919
Are you dumping me?

12:02.654 --> 12:05.289
Yes, yes, he is dumping you.

12:06.256 --> 12:08.959
Plastic bitch, hopefully
into a landfill.

12:09.327 --> 12:14.030
Jesus,
Billy.

12:14.031 --> 12:17.901
Brother, that was
straight cold, seriously.

12:18.602 --> 12:19.871
It's been two weeks now right?

12:20.270 --> 12:21.505
How you feeling man?

12:23.842 --> 12:25.175
I think I'm ready
to go back to work.

12:26.510 --> 12:27.779
Work?

12:29.347 --> 12:32.250
Vera, she still busting
your balls, is that it?

12:33.684 --> 12:35.085
It's her hobby.

12:35.520 --> 12:37.621
You're supposed to be
home relaxing man, you know.

12:38.255 --> 12:40.290
Chill out, smell the roses.

12:42.559 --> 12:43.994
You got to take
care of that ticker

12:43.995 --> 12:45.897
of yours, that's
what's important.

12:47.064 --> 12:48.666
Somebody better
tell Vera that.

12:50.802 --> 12:51.970
Hey!

12:52.404 --> 12:53.371
What the hell!

12:53.372 --> 12:54.539
You ever hear of 'excuse me'?

12:56.374 --> 12:57.207
Hey!

12:58.143 --> 12:59.476
Hell no.

13:00.245 --> 13:02.013
Son of a bitch.

13:02.212 --> 13:04.882
Hell, Billy
don't, stop Billy!

13:08.385 --> 13:10.154
Billy! Don't do it man!

13:13.658 --> 13:14.625
Hey!

13:15.760 --> 13:17.062
Let it go, Billy!

13:17.696 --> 13:19.931
Jesus Christ.

13:50.528 --> 13:52.964
Jesus, Bill?

13:55.100 --> 13:56.601
What happened to the show?

13:57.101 --> 13:58.336
What show?

13:59.370 --> 14:01.171
I only asked you
to do one thing,

14:01.172 --> 14:03.341
my Celebrity Dance Off.

14:03.406 --> 14:04.808
Why didn't you record it?

14:05.610 --> 14:07.479
Why don't you just watch
the show when it's on?

14:08.145 --> 14:09.813
Honey, I'm sorry, I hate,

14:10.280 --> 14:11.482
I can't stand that thing.

14:12.350 --> 14:14.418
You say that, Bill,
but when you got

14:14.419 --> 14:16.821
nothing else to do all day long

14:16.886 --> 14:18.922
but hang out with your
lazy-assed friend,

14:18.923 --> 14:20.558
it's a little disappointing.

14:22.659 --> 14:23.895
Disappointing?

14:25.230 --> 14:26.464
I'm just saying.

14:28.366 --> 14:30.801
Honey, I did not hang
out with Stan all day,

14:30.802 --> 14:32.336
we just had lunch, all right.

14:32.337 --> 14:33.571
I just had other things to do.

14:33.871 --> 14:34.805
Like what?

14:35.405 --> 14:36.707
Like getting the oil changed.

14:37.275 --> 14:38.610
Getting stuff for work.

14:39.443 --> 14:40.678
For work?

14:41.212 --> 14:43.247
You're not going back to
work already, are you?

14:45.015 --> 14:47.519
But what about
your yard project?

14:47.885 --> 14:49.486
You mean, your yard project.

14:50.454 --> 14:53.990
Bill, your doctor told
you to take it easy.

14:53.991 --> 14:55.726
It's only been two weeks.

14:56.627 --> 14:58.595
My blood pressure is down.

15:00.063 --> 15:01.765
Yeah, that's hard to believe.

15:02.667 --> 15:04.835
Billy, the doctor
told you he wants you

15:04.836 --> 15:07.138
to avoid a stressful
environment.

15:07.704 --> 15:10.007
That's why I'm going
back to work, sweetheart.

15:12.644 --> 15:13.878
I'm just saying.

15:31.795 --> 15:35.499
Crap!

16:04.428 --> 16:05.329
Sweetie, no one's gonna

16:05.330 --> 16:06.797
throw you out on the street.

16:07.130 --> 16:09.467
And no one's gonna sell
all your things, okay?

16:10.968 --> 16:13.003
Well, they got to send
you a letter first.

16:14.038 --> 16:15.073
They better not.

16:15.372 --> 16:17.074
I have nowhere else to go.

16:17.708 --> 16:19.243
Well, what
else is wrong, honey?

16:19.677 --> 16:21.379
I have
other bills, you know.

16:21.813 --> 16:23.213
What about my Botox?

16:24.281 --> 16:26.482
All I hear is words,
words don't mean crap,

16:26.483 --> 16:29.920
Stanley, or pay
my bills, so talk.

16:30.487 --> 16:32.656
Honey, I ain't got
nothing else I can give you.

16:33.057 --> 16:35.326
I mean I don't and
if I did, I would.

16:35.760 --> 16:37.294
And I told your lawyer that.

16:37.361 --> 16:39.962
And he told me that
you're a filthy no-good liar.

16:39.963 --> 16:42.266
He said chemist's
makes serious money.

16:43.134 --> 16:45.736
Chemists with
three ex-wives don't, okay?

16:46.337 --> 16:49.674
God, listen honey, I, I
need to go, all right?

16:50.140 --> 16:51.408
Listen, I'll call you back later

16:51.409 --> 16:52.909
and we'll work
something out, okay?

16:52.910 --> 16:54.212
Don't
you hang up Stanley.

16:55.346 --> 16:57.649
God! Jesus!

16:58.316 --> 16:59.450
I love you, baby.

17:00.351 --> 17:01.551
She's suing you
for the third time,

17:01.552 --> 17:02.654
and you're giving her that shit?

17:04.188 --> 17:05.122
It's my way of keeping her

17:05.123 --> 17:06.757
psychologically medicated, Bill.

17:06.990 --> 17:08.759
I mean, it's where I
need her to be right now.

17:09.226 --> 17:10.393
Where you need her to be is

17:10.394 --> 17:12.596
in a coffin six feet
under the ground.

17:13.665 --> 17:14.699
That's a bit harsh.

17:15.198 --> 17:16.133
So what's up?

17:19.836 --> 17:21.305
I need a loan for a lawyer.

17:24.342 --> 17:25.509
How much this time?

17:30.982 --> 17:32.183
You already owe me a grand.

17:33.517 --> 17:34.751
I do?

17:36.688 --> 17:39.090
Well, tax time, that's
right around the corner.

17:39.290 --> 17:40.457
We can work it out.

17:43.393 --> 17:45.262
Okay, but after
this time that's it.

17:45.463 --> 17:47.632
Yeah,
thanks buddy, yeah.

17:48.032 --> 17:49.198
You know you'd be better off

17:49.199 --> 17:50.367
using my three grand
to hire a hitman.

17:50.501 --> 17:52.704
Now where might I
find one of those?

17:52.803 --> 17:54.072
Hell, I don't know, internet?

17:54.839 --> 17:56.407
Why don't you look for
three for one special?

17:56.473 --> 17:57.909
Three ex-wives for
the price of one.

17:58.909 --> 18:01.079
Interesting that you bring
up the subject of poisons.

18:01.545 --> 18:03.213
They have a fascinating
history, you know.

18:07.784 --> 18:10.287
What would you say is
the fastest acting poison?

18:11.688 --> 18:12.790
How fast?

18:14.359 --> 18:16.894
Kills you
instantly? Right away!

18:18.329 --> 18:20.865
Well, I don't know too many
that have worked that fast,

18:20.930 --> 18:22.631
but you know there are several

18:22.632 --> 18:24.434
that bring almost
instant paralysis.

18:25.602 --> 18:28.639
You know, you're dead like
thirty seconds later.

18:29.607 --> 18:31.009
That's good enough for me.

18:34.544 --> 18:36.546
Why are you so suddenly
interested in poisons?

18:36.747 --> 18:38.149
I'm just a curious cat.

18:39.883 --> 18:41.685
Curiosity killed
the cat, my friend.

18:42.320 --> 18:44.088
Cat should have been
more damned careful.

18:47.124 --> 18:49.159
Okay, I got a raccoon
tearing up the yard.

18:49.226 --> 18:50.227
I got to do something.

18:50.561 --> 18:51.996
Little bastards!

19:04.374 --> 19:09.380
Excuse, girl, Veronica
can kiss my hairy rearend.

19:09.980 --> 19:11.782
She is not the boss of me.

19:12.315 --> 19:14.851
It's hard to believe she's
still got a damn job.

19:15.620 --> 19:17.588
She got to be blowing
somebody in Contracts.

19:19.357 --> 19:20.591
Sweet Jesus!

20:25.489 --> 20:27.257
You were coming
to bed an hour ago.

20:27.725 --> 20:29.427
What are you doing in
here on a Friday night?

20:32.063 --> 20:33.196
You know I still
remember a time

20:33.197 --> 20:35.198
when people knocked,
even on Fridays.

20:35.533 --> 20:38.503
Sorry, did I interrupt
you jerking off or something?

20:39.169 --> 20:40.670
No, I did that earlier.

20:40.971 --> 20:42.272
Now I'm planning our future.

20:43.341 --> 20:45.042
I can only imagine.

20:45.543 --> 20:46.743
Well, you're going to
need more than a plan

20:46.744 --> 20:48.713
if you ever plan to
be someone, Bill.

20:50.046 --> 20:51.481
I am someone, sweetheart.

20:52.082 --> 20:53.450
I'm Bill Johnson.

20:53.950 --> 20:55.486
I'm perfectly happy
with that, okay?

20:55.852 --> 20:57.955
Life isn't just a
dress rehearsal, Bill.

20:58.288 --> 20:59.823
You really need to step it up.

21:05.129 --> 21:07.165
I got a few
surprises up my sleeve.

21:09.132 --> 21:11.501
I believe that this is

21:11.502 --> 21:13.004
what you were inquiring about.

21:17.140 --> 21:18.642
A little Hollywood,
don't you think?

21:19.110 --> 21:21.811
Hell no, I don't want
you to be mistaking it

21:21.812 --> 21:24.448
for, you know, cough syrup.

21:24.649 --> 21:25.882
How much punch does it have?

21:26.984 --> 21:30.755
Let's put it this way.
They ain't getting up.

21:33.024 --> 21:34.158
Who's they?

21:35.092 --> 21:36.294
I don't know.

21:36.627 --> 21:38.596
I should be asking
you that, mystery man.

21:40.430 --> 21:43.967
Raccoons? Yeah.

21:46.370 --> 21:48.573
Hey, that work
colleague you mentioned

21:48.939 --> 21:50.274
is he fat and bald?

21:51.809 --> 21:54.946
Are you talking about
Flip, Flip Feinstein?

21:55.478 --> 21:57.614
Hell yeah, he's uglier than
both of us combined, Billy.

21:57.848 --> 21:59.250
His name is Flip?

21:59.350 --> 22:02.687
Yeah, but everyone seems
to call him, Big Boy.

22:03.621 --> 22:06.657
He seems to fancy himself
quite the lady's man.

22:06.723 --> 22:07.658
You're kidding me?

22:08.626 --> 22:09.594
Yes, I'm kidding.

22:10.428 --> 22:12.129
Well, you seen the guy, right?

22:12.195 --> 22:13.864
Hell, I'm thinking
the last woman

22:13.865 --> 22:17.400
that actually touched his
wiener was his mother.

22:17.834 --> 22:20.438
Yeah, she was changing
his diaper. Yeah.

23:06.016 --> 23:08.451
Yep, I should be home
around seven o'clock.

23:10.187 --> 23:11.822
What the hell?

23:13.024 --> 23:14.625
No problem.

23:15.126 --> 23:17.395
Come on buddy, get your stinking
tank out of my driveway.

23:17.396 --> 23:22.400
Mother fucking
bastard, ridiculous.

23:25.402 --> 23:28.572
Hey zip cat, were your
ears painted on or what?

23:28.872 --> 23:30.341
Are you having
a bad day, buddy?

23:30.775 --> 23:32.075
You're in my driveway.

23:32.610 --> 23:33.843
I got to go to work.

23:36.413 --> 23:37.448
Okay, I gotta go.

23:41.419 --> 23:42.753
So that's how it is?

24:01.738 --> 24:03.373
Jesus, this guy's on the tank.

24:09.179 --> 24:11.916
Son of a bitch, this
guy's gonna kill somebody.

24:15.753 --> 24:19.724
Son of a bitch.

24:31.899 --> 24:32.702
What's your problem, faggot?

24:32.703 --> 24:33.602
You want a date or something?

24:33.603 --> 24:34.572
Hold on man.

24:34.804 --> 24:37.307
You are my problem, asshole.

24:37.874 --> 24:39.809
You don't quit driving like
that you're gonna kill somebody.

24:41.144 --> 24:42.679
I can't hear you
man. I can't hear you.

24:46.751 --> 24:47.485
Shit.

24:48.486 --> 24:49.719
Are you crazy?

25:14.011 --> 25:16.747
Nice job, Mr. Johnson,
I'm very impressed.

25:17.581 --> 25:19.917
Whatever it is you're
doing seems to be working.

25:20.484 --> 25:21.752
Care to share your secret?

25:22.186 --> 25:25.456
Not yet, it's still
in the testing stage.

25:26.055 --> 25:28.825
I see, well other than that,
how's everything else been?

25:29.126 --> 25:30.528
You staying out of trouble?

25:30.593 --> 25:33.264
For the most part yeah,
I did go back to work.

25:33.831 --> 25:37.101
I don't know, it
may be a bit soon.

25:37.567 --> 25:39.035
You still need to take it easy.

25:40.603 --> 25:42.105
I can't relax at home, doc.

25:42.739 --> 25:43.841
Does your wife work?

25:44.007 --> 25:45.642
From home.

25:46.209 --> 25:50.914
I see, all right, but
just don't overdo it, okay?

25:50.915 --> 25:51.949
Yes, sir.

25:52.283 --> 25:53.384
Now listen to me.

25:53.385 --> 25:54.884
You're not recovering
from a cold.

25:54.950 --> 25:56.152
The heart means business.

25:56.786 --> 25:58.255
Thanks, doc, I understand.

25:59.023 --> 26:03.660
Brent! Brent!

26:03.960 --> 26:05.563
Sir, over here.

26:08.932 --> 26:11.835
Don't tell me we got
transferred now back to traffic?

26:13.169 --> 26:15.706
No sir, no, no, this
isn't a traffic case.

26:16.540 --> 26:17.842
In fact, I think this
man was murdered.

26:20.878 --> 26:22.480
You want to enlighten me?

26:23.313 --> 26:24.481
Come take a look.

26:29.285 --> 26:30.387
What am I looking at?

26:30.787 --> 26:31.554
Here.

26:38.027 --> 26:38.962
You see that dart?

26:39.229 --> 26:42.765
Yeah, I got eyes, I can see.

26:44.802 --> 26:45.969
That didn't kill him.

26:46.669 --> 26:51.241
No, sir, but I believe
that this one did.

26:54.011 --> 26:55.379
It was removed from
the victim's neck.

26:56.479 --> 26:57.581
I'm guessing poison.

27:20.103 --> 27:21.304
Dear God, not again.

27:32.216 --> 27:35.052
No refuge from these
inconsiderate bastards.

27:35.252 --> 27:36.654
Lionel, you know

27:39.156 --> 27:41.292
no, nothing personal to it,

27:41.425 --> 27:43.260
I despise all men,

27:43.994 --> 27:45.396
actually I despise...

27:45.728 --> 27:47.130
all women too.

27:47.931 --> 27:49.832
Come to think of it,

27:50.034 --> 27:51.768
I despise everyone.

27:57.775 --> 28:01.078
Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.

28:03.013 --> 28:05.716
Could you keep it down please,
it's kind of a small theater.

28:06.449 --> 28:08.117
Could you turn off
your phone, too?

28:08.919 --> 28:09.553
Thank you.

28:16.794 --> 28:19.529
Screw him, the guy
thinks he owns the place.

28:19.530 --> 28:20.497
I know.

28:20.563 --> 28:21.732
Jesus.

28:21.832 --> 28:23.766
Hold the
phone up a little higher

28:24.234 --> 28:26.236
so they can see it on the TV.

28:30.474 --> 28:32.042
Let's go
this Indian place.

28:33.310 --> 28:34.510
I hate Indian food.

28:34.511 --> 28:35.913
No, it's
good for your skin.

28:49.994 --> 28:52.395
Excuse me, I just asked you

28:52.396 --> 28:54.598
politely to please keep it down.

28:55.198 --> 28:56.366
Who the hell are you?

28:56.499 --> 28:59.135
Shut your pie hole!
My turn to talk.

29:00.169 --> 29:01.571
I paid fourteen
bucks for a movie,

29:01.572 --> 29:04.207
I don't pay to listen
to your mundane bullshit

29:04.374 --> 29:06.476
or to watch you wave your
stupid phones around.

29:07.877 --> 29:09.279
Don't you shush me!

29:09.780 --> 29:11.015
I'm doing this for you, too.

29:11.814 --> 29:13.315
Hell, I'm doing
this for all of you.

29:13.316 --> 29:15.518
Not one of you sons-a-bitches
have the balls to complain.

29:17.487 --> 29:18.687
Turn the phone off and keep

29:18.688 --> 29:20.189
your mouth shut until
the movie is over.

29:20.724 --> 29:21.692
Thank you.

29:22.359 --> 29:23.360
Fuck you.

31:27.918 --> 31:28.819
Please!
Give it to me.

31:28.820 --> 31:29.620
Yeah, baby!

31:29.621 --> 31:30.419
Come on!

31:33.189 --> 31:34.956
Baby.

31:34.957 --> 31:36.627
Fuck,
Flip, give it to me.

31:40.997 --> 31:41.998
Come on,
turn around baby.

31:48.438 --> 31:52.743
Yeah, hell yes,
baby, hell yes.

32:10.960 --> 32:13.496
Ashley? Hey.

32:14.297 --> 32:15.997
What are you doing
here? What a surprise!

32:15.998 --> 32:16.999
Come here.

32:19.069 --> 32:20.268
What are you trying to do?

32:20.269 --> 32:21.537
Give your old man
another heart attack?

32:21.905 --> 32:23.139
I'm sorry, Daddy.

32:23.140 --> 32:24.707
I did call the house,
but there was no answer.

32:24.975 --> 32:26.476
That's all right, I'll
forgive you this time.

32:27.377 --> 32:29.313
It's good to see
you. You look great.

32:29.979 --> 32:31.480
You're looking good yourself.

32:32.615 --> 32:34.250
Much better than how
Mom described you.

32:34.851 --> 32:36.285
What were you expecting?

32:36.986 --> 32:39.288
I, I don't know, I thought
you'd be in bed at least.

32:39.857 --> 32:40.858
Really?

32:43.826 --> 32:46.762
My God,
look who's here.

32:46.964 --> 32:48.065
Hey

32:48.631 --> 32:50.132
When did you drop in?

32:50.367 --> 32:51.601
An hour ago?

32:52.268 --> 32:53.636
You staying for dinner?

32:54.103 --> 32:55.504
I'd love to, but
we're heading back

32:55.505 --> 32:57.174
to Atlanta for dinner
date at Dave's parents.

32:57.673 --> 32:59.842
How are his parents doing?

33:00.343 --> 33:03.513
They're fine, still on
that exercise kick, Mom?

33:03.913 --> 33:07.016
It's not a kick, Ashley,
it's a way of life.

33:08.951 --> 33:10.286
That's just great.

33:11.021 --> 33:12.890
Dad's looking pretty good?

33:13.790 --> 33:16.026
Well, I don't know
what you call good,

33:16.092 --> 33:17.593
I mean, he's still
not out of the woods.

33:18.629 --> 33:20.163
What woods would
those be dear?

33:20.730 --> 33:25.568
This is V.

33:29.438 --> 33:33.176
Daddy, Mom never stops
just pounding away, does she?

33:34.511 --> 33:38.348
Yeah, yeah, your Mom's
a regular jackhammer.

33:43.320 --> 33:44.487
What's going on, Sweetie?

33:45.255 --> 33:47.689
I don't know to tell you this,

33:47.690 --> 33:51.560
but I really am surprised
to see you looking so good.

33:52.295 --> 33:53.462
I mean, it's great,
don't get me wrong,

33:54.497 --> 33:56.364
It's just that when
Mom said there was

33:56.365 --> 33:58.734
all kind of complications,
after the heart attack,

33:58.834 --> 34:00.703
and that's why you
guys needed the money,

34:00.704 --> 34:04.441
I, I expected you to look
like crap and you don't.

34:06.677 --> 34:07.678
What money?

34:08.110 --> 34:09.210
For the operation?

34:09.579 --> 34:11.047
After your insurance
got cancelled?

34:12.215 --> 34:13.216
What operation?

34:14.851 --> 34:16.018
Your bypass?

34:17.454 --> 34:20.956
The bypass,
yeah, how much money

34:20.956 --> 34:22.458
was that again, Sweetie?

34:22.925 --> 34:24.327
$150,000.

34:27.331 --> 34:30.132
Your mother asked
David for a $150,000?

34:30.699 --> 34:32.534
Well, she asked David if
he would ask his parents.

34:33.070 --> 34:35.036
They were cool. They
were happy to help.

34:36.172 --> 34:37.174
When was this?

34:37.907 --> 34:39.409
Couple days ago.

34:39.474 --> 34:41.577
Mom's going to be mad as hell
at me for telling you this.

34:42.143 --> 34:43.947
She made me promise
not to say anything.

34:44.081 --> 34:44.914
Not a word.

34:45.681 --> 34:46.650
Scout's honor?

34:47.050 --> 34:48.318
Scout's honor.

34:52.922 --> 34:56.324
Daddy, next operation,
it, it's serious, right?

34:56.592 --> 34:57.894
It's serious.

34:59.028 --> 35:00.896
Well, don't die
me, Daddy, okay?

35:01.331 --> 35:02.733
I'd hate to be left
alone with Mom.

35:03.800 --> 35:06.236
I'm not going anywhere,
not for a while.

35:06.802 --> 35:07.737
You better not.

35:07.938 --> 35:09.271
You know how much I love you.

35:10.874 --> 35:11.875
I love you more.

35:12.608 --> 35:13.809
That's debatable.

35:14.711 --> 35:15.877
And
embedded in the necks

35:15.878 --> 35:17.580
of both victims were
needlelike darts.

35:17.581 --> 35:19.216
The police suspect the
needles contained a poison,

35:19.217 --> 35:21.717
which killed the victims
soon after impact.

35:22.485 --> 35:23.686
Here they come.

35:23.986 --> 35:25.020
Okay, back
up, give us some space,

35:25.021 --> 35:26.389
give us some space, please.

35:26.889 --> 35:28.257
Detective?

35:28.258 --> 35:29.026
Give us a minute, please.
Put that camera down.

35:29.027 --> 35:29.926
Detective!

35:29.927 --> 35:31.127
Give us a second, please.

35:31.128 --> 35:32.261
Detective, please,
early reports suggested

35:32.262 --> 35:33.997
there was a witness
in the theatre.

35:34.764 --> 35:36.998
We have
several witnesses, yeah.

35:36.999 --> 35:39.534
According to the wife
of the victim, here,

35:39.535 --> 35:41.537
the husband, he had some
sort of scuffle here

35:42.039 --> 35:43.774
with some man prior
to the incident.

35:43.974 --> 35:46.075
I don't think that
individual is involved.

35:46.610 --> 35:49.277
If he could indulge me and
come down to the department,

35:49.278 --> 35:51.680
have a coffee with
me, I can clear him.

35:51.947 --> 35:53.849
And I'll just be the
old fly on the wall.

35:54.151 --> 35:55.419
Enough of the questions,
enough of the questions,

35:55.420 --> 35:58.087
put the cameras
down, please, man.

35:58.153 --> 35:59.587
Give that girl

35:59.588 --> 36:01.656
on her knees and pray to
God she wears those shoes.

36:01.657 --> 36:03.225
Mr. Gates, the last
victim of the individual

36:03.226 --> 36:05.226
some have called "The Dart Man"

36:05.227 --> 36:07.263
died while watching the
critically acclaimed

36:07.264 --> 36:09.666
Oscar nominated, "Six
Bullets for Barbara."

36:09.765 --> 36:10.766
Holy Shit,

36:10.767 --> 36:11.568
He
Was 73 years old

36:11.569 --> 36:12.202
and leaves behind a wife

36:12.203 --> 36:13.136
He did it.

36:13.137 --> 36:14.204
And three dogs.

36:14.671 --> 36:16.039
That son of a bitch did it!

36:19.242 --> 36:20.444
What?

36:20.876 --> 36:21.744
Johnson, that you?

36:21.745 --> 36:23.079
Who else would it be?

36:23.280 --> 36:24.714
Yes, Mr. Lee, yes, it's me.

36:24.914 --> 36:26.348
Welcome back
to the rat race, Johnson.

36:26.349 --> 36:30.086
I'm sorry, but
plans changed this morning.

36:30.352 --> 36:32.255
I need you back at Bells,
pop off right here.

36:33.155 --> 36:35.290
No, Mr. Lee, I'm five
minutes from the barracks,

36:35.291 --> 36:37.193
it'll take me ninety
minutes to get back to Bell.

36:37.494 --> 36:38.793
It can wait
till the afternoon.

36:38.794 --> 36:41.298
Bell building more
important, more money.

36:41.430 --> 36:42.964
Mr. Lee, I'm not
working this afternoon.

36:42.965 --> 36:44.300
What?

36:44.633 --> 36:46.035
Why you not tell me that?

36:46.336 --> 36:48.638
You know I'm on half days
for the next two weeks.

36:48.704 --> 36:50.173
I had a heart attack, remember?

36:50.238 --> 36:53.142
Half day no good
today, I already short staffed.

36:53.510 --> 36:54.845
I need you help me out.

36:55.512 --> 36:58.180
Okay, what the hell,
all right, I'll do it.

36:59.814 --> 37:01.083
I said I'll do it, I'll
do it this afternoon.

37:01.218 --> 37:03.120
Why are you
still on phone, Johnson?

37:03.352 --> 37:04.621
Get cracking!

37:12.928 --> 37:15.131
Yeah, so that's what I
was trying to tell you.

37:17.267 --> 37:18.735
What?

37:18.968 --> 37:22.271
Well, if they expect me to
do that, they can pay me.

37:22.706 --> 37:24.341
Do I look like a charity?

37:25.275 --> 37:27.510
No, you look like an
island with an elephant legs.

37:27.644 --> 37:31.180
What, what kind of
validation I need Jemma?

37:31.581 --> 37:35.017
I know, I'm beautiful.

37:35.452 --> 37:39.289
Well, he's a wimp, I
wouldn't date his ass either.

37:39.722 --> 37:41.991
Have you seen the
kind of car he drives?

37:42.626 --> 37:45.127
A ugly truck with
a tray in the back.

37:45.128 --> 37:48.198
Get real, McNeil!

37:48.798 --> 37:52.169
Well, I done heard every
excuse in the lexicon, darling.

37:52.903 --> 37:54.703
My ex-wife's gouging
me, I'm still trying

37:54.704 --> 37:58.374
to pay my college loans,
I prefer to eat at home.

37:59.476 --> 38:01.811
The cracker

38:02.111 --> 38:04.313
My parents lost their
savings on Wall Street,

38:04.314 --> 38:06.917
and I'm still trying to
help them out, yeah, right.

38:09.218 --> 38:11.554
Kick him to the curb baby.

38:11.555 --> 38:13.557
He is not going to put
a ring on your finger.

38:14.256 --> 38:16.626
Well, at least not
the one you deserve.

38:16.691 --> 38:19.461
He don't deserve you, you need
to get with someone who does.

38:20.063 --> 38:21.798
You should try a dating site.

38:22.865 --> 38:24.501
Yeah, a Jewish dating site.

38:25.135 --> 38:27.670
Who gives a shit that
you're not Jewish,

38:27.671 --> 38:29.639
by the time he finds
out, it'll be too late.

38:33.043 --> 38:33.977
Dear.

38:38.280 --> 38:42.117
Gosh, excuse
me, it's my floor.

38:47.823 --> 38:48.992
Is she all right?

38:54.497 --> 38:55.498
Hello!

38:56.332 --> 38:57.800
Is that you William?

38:57.968 --> 38:59.134
No, this is Santa Claus.

38:59.135 --> 39:00.770
William's out back
feeding an elf.

39:00.970 --> 39:02.670
Well Santa in case you happen

39:02.671 --> 39:04.706
to be driving that
sleigh of yours,

39:04.707 --> 39:07.610
I suggest you stop by my
place on your way home?

39:08.077 --> 39:10.145
There's something that
Billy and I need to discuss.

39:10.146 --> 39:11.414
Why? What the
hell's so important?

39:12.048 --> 39:13.816
Don't you watch the news?

39:14.818 --> 39:15.952
Okay.

39:17.921 --> 39:19.155
All right, I'm here,
what's going on?

39:19.289 --> 39:20.523
Jesus, get in here.

39:20.956 --> 39:22.092
You're all over the news.

39:23.593 --> 39:24.627
That douchebag at the movies,

39:24.628 --> 39:27.929
some guy in a car, Jesus, Billy.

39:27.930 --> 39:29.098
What are you doing man?

39:29.099 --> 39:30.633
You're running around
killing people.

39:30.834 --> 39:32.368
Some detective thinks
that the same person

39:32.369 --> 39:35.939
might responsible for
both murders.

39:36.439 --> 39:37.774
Brilliant?

39:37.974 --> 39:39.909
My doctor said to
eliminate stress from life.

39:40.510 --> 39:42.678
Yeah, and you
took his advice.

39:42.979 --> 39:44.214
Clearly, it's working.

39:45.048 --> 39:46.549
I had a rough couple of days.

39:46.715 --> 39:47.483
Yeah?

39:48.184 --> 39:49.352
Tell me about it.

39:50.552 --> 39:54.857
All right, so Vera's
exercise program

39:54.858 --> 39:56.760
now includes
screwing her clients.

39:57.427 --> 39:59.595
And the client she's
screwing is your buddy.

40:00.195 --> 40:01.630
Big Boy?

40:01.697 --> 40:04.233
And screwing in the park

40:04.300 --> 40:06.002
is the exercise
program she has him on.

40:06.503 --> 40:08.804
You, you actually saw 'em?

40:08.805 --> 40:10.406
Yeah, I saw him, and let
me tell you something buddy,

40:10.407 --> 40:12.007
she wasn't changing
his diaper either.

40:12.008 --> 40:14.577
Jesus, Billy,
hell no, hell no.

40:15.010 --> 40:16.277
And on top of that
I just found out

40:16.278 --> 40:18.013
that Vera conned David's family

40:18.014 --> 40:19.416
out of a whole bunch of money.

40:19.481 --> 40:20.915
And she's probably
going to use it

40:20.916 --> 40:23.285
to hire a lawyer to take
me for everything I have.

40:24.421 --> 40:26.489
Maybe run off with Big
Boy, who the hell knows.

40:27.724 --> 40:28.624
Is that all?

40:30.360 --> 40:33.128
No, no, actually it's not.

40:35.131 --> 40:37.434
I also killed a fat hog
in an elevator today,

40:38.101 --> 40:39.568
and it didn't do shit
for my blood pressure.

40:40.869 --> 40:44.173
So after three murders, my
solution is no longer working.

40:46.343 --> 40:47.277
What's going on with you?

40:47.278 --> 40:48.677
You gotta be better than me?

40:48.977 --> 40:50.279
And you're gonna, you're
gonna want to shoot me

40:50.280 --> 40:51.481
with one of them
damned darts of yours,

40:53.015 --> 40:54.249
when you hear what
I got to tell you.

40:54.351 --> 40:57.854
Sweet Jesus, all
right, okay, hit me.

40:59.689 --> 41:04.627
God, I gave
Thelma the three grand.

41:05.528 --> 41:06.963
You are a lunatic.

41:07.028 --> 41:09.298
And, of course, she lost
it all, gambled it all.

41:10.400 --> 41:12.135
I mean, she is pissier
than ever, Billy.

41:12.369 --> 41:13.803
She is definitely suing me.

41:14.604 --> 41:17.140
Congratulations Stanley,
you are officially

41:17.141 --> 41:19.842
a bigger fucking idiot
than I thought you were.

41:19.909 --> 41:21.111
The money was for your lawyer.

41:21.177 --> 41:23.145
I know, I know,
and I wholly intended

41:23.146 --> 41:24.613
to give it to him, I did.

41:24.680 --> 41:26.114
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but after
you banged her all night,

41:26.115 --> 41:28.217
your brain turned to mush
and you thought 41 years

41:28.218 --> 41:30.420
of insanity would be
cured with three grand?

41:30.854 --> 41:32.855
Well, she was
starting to sound

41:32.856 --> 41:34.557
real reasonable,
Billy, I mean, really.

41:34.724 --> 41:35.891
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, about the time

41:35.892 --> 41:37.360
she was having a
screaming orgasm?

41:37.860 --> 41:41.363
Yeah, yeah, you know, it
was right about that time.

41:46.769 --> 41:48.737
I'm sorry, Billy, I didn't...

41:48.738 --> 41:51.775
Shut up, shut up or
I'll murder you, too.

41:57.414 --> 42:01.551
All right, I got to kill her.

42:03.352 --> 42:04.454
That's what has to happen.

42:06.622 --> 42:07.523
You owe me.

42:09.258 --> 42:11.628
You owe me Thelma's murder.

42:15.731 --> 42:18.567
No, you can't be serious?

42:18.668 --> 42:20.135
Yes, I'm serious.

42:21.037 --> 42:23.439
If this friendship's gonna
survive, she has to go.

42:27.142 --> 42:29.111
She started murdering
you the day she met you.

42:30.947 --> 42:35.684
No, it can't be a dart
or the same poison for her.

42:37.921 --> 42:39.589
That'll lead the
cops straight to you.

42:47.130 --> 42:48.664
You're not thinking about
shooting her, are you?

42:51.099 --> 42:52.434
That's what the
bitch deserves.

42:54.503 --> 42:55.771
No, that'll be dumb.

42:57.773 --> 43:01.143
Besides, I want to be
close when I do it.

43:03.213 --> 43:05.014
I want to see the
life force leave.

43:17.860 --> 43:22.865
All right, all right.

43:26.369 --> 43:29.972
Maybe cyanide in
spray form, yeah.

43:32.175 --> 43:36.178
Two, maybe three
blasts in her mouth,

43:40.215 --> 43:41.784
almost instant paralysis,

43:46.021 --> 43:47.456
it'll look like a heart attack.

43:47.890 --> 43:48.791
Is it detectable?

43:51.628 --> 43:52.428
Nope.

43:53.329 --> 43:54.264
You positive?

43:57.666 --> 43:58.867
Yeah.

44:00.802 --> 44:02.204
We gotta find a
way to get to her.

44:03.639 --> 44:05.007
Doesn't she still
live with her mother?

44:06.376 --> 44:07.443
Hell, she even work?

44:09.345 --> 44:10.947
Why would she want to do that?

44:12.180 --> 44:13.782
She's got me working for her.

44:16.218 --> 44:17.386
The only time she ever leaves

44:17.387 --> 44:19.122
the house is to
go see her lawyer.

44:20.557 --> 44:21.758
And I'm paying for that, too.

44:23.726 --> 44:24.961
Not for long.

44:28.363 --> 44:32.101
Hey, she still in that
twelve step program?

44:45.314 --> 44:46.548
What are you doing today?

44:47.617 --> 44:48.952
Taking care of a problem.

44:49.718 --> 44:50.986
You forgot your phone.

44:51.421 --> 44:52.689
No, I didn't.

45:06.135 --> 45:07.903
Wait, wait, wait.

45:09.204 --> 45:10.139
Damn.

45:10.204 --> 45:11.373
No, no, no, that stays here.

45:11.974 --> 45:13.175
What?

45:13.242 --> 45:14.142
The cell phone, it's
a tracking device.

45:14.143 --> 45:15.945
Gets pinged by cell towers.

45:16.278 --> 45:17.947
That's how cops place
you at a crime scene.

45:18.514 --> 45:19.716
Seriously?

45:19.782 --> 45:22.552
Seriously, It's
called triangulation.

45:23.086 --> 45:24.819
Anybody that brings a
cell phone with them to do

45:24.820 --> 45:26.389
a crime is just
asking to get caught.

45:28.825 --> 45:30.360
What do I do now?

45:30.793 --> 45:32.160
Leave it here and turn it on.

45:32.361 --> 45:33.562
That way if you're
ever suspected,

45:33.563 --> 45:34.930
it looks like you
were home all day.

45:40.168 --> 45:41.303
That's neat.

45:41.369 --> 45:42.738
All right, let's
rock and roll.

45:42.905 --> 45:45.408
Yeah, shit.

46:05.128 --> 46:07.729
Jesus, there she is, Bill.

46:09.231 --> 46:10.465
She's right on time.

46:10.666 --> 46:12.668
At least she has one
positive attribute.

46:16.171 --> 46:19.976
Okay, remember all right,
two blasts and then she's down.

46:21.343 --> 46:22.512
You sure about that?

46:23.845 --> 46:25.081
You wanna test it?

46:25.381 --> 46:27.984
No, no, just fine,
take your word for it.

46:29.785 --> 46:32.755
You know if she doesn't go to
the bathroom, we're screwed.

46:34.657 --> 46:37.325
She'll use it, her
bladder is like a sieve.

46:40.997 --> 46:41.864
Good luck.

46:42.197 --> 46:43.365
Thanks.

46:43.566 --> 46:44.900
Last time I went
to an AA meeting,

46:44.901 --> 46:46.803
I wasn't planning on
killing anybody but myself.

46:46.968 --> 46:51.974
Yeah, yeah.

48:28.838 --> 48:30.906
Help, my goodness.

48:30.907 --> 48:34.709
I'm sorry, someone
help me, please.

48:34.910 --> 48:35.811
My God!

48:35.945 --> 48:37.212
Miss, could you help me?

48:37.213 --> 48:41.082
I have taken a tumble,
I'm so sorry, dear.

48:41.584 --> 48:42.685
I'm so embarrassed.

48:43.052 --> 48:44.153
Are you all right?

48:44.352 --> 48:46.255
I'm so sorry, I can't just

48:47.356 --> 48:48.256
Thank you.

48:48.257 --> 48:49.959
Do you need medication?

48:50.226 --> 48:50.860
Thank you, my...

48:56.432 --> 48:57.633
Bill?

49:01.871 --> 49:04.807
I never liked you,
Thelma, you're mean.

49:41.943 --> 49:43.813
She didn't suffer, did she?

49:48.684 --> 49:49.986
It was just like you said.

49:51.320 --> 49:53.055
Couple of blasts
and she was gone.

50:07.570 --> 50:08.504
Thank you.

50:11.039 --> 50:12.207
That's what friends are for.

51:35.957 --> 51:37.126
Who invited Big Boy?

51:39.695 --> 51:41.097
He invited himself.

51:42.298 --> 51:44.000
He's the one who
introduced me to Thelma.

51:46.302 --> 51:47.903
Why does that not surprise me?

51:52.508 --> 51:53.876
How ya feeling?

51:56.678 --> 52:01.650
Like Houdini after a
spectacular escape.

52:24.939 --> 52:27.909
Sautéed onions and
peppers, that sounds good.

52:30.146 --> 52:31.414
Good afternoon, Mr. Kelly.

52:32.715 --> 52:34.316
You don't mind if
I sit down, do you?

52:34.784 --> 52:37.153
Well actually I wanted
to spend some time alone.

52:37.218 --> 52:38.387
Thank you, I appreciate it.

52:38.887 --> 52:39.822
Sure

52:39.988 --> 52:42.556
Detective Jordan, I don't want

52:42.557 --> 52:44.860
to be here, to
tell you the truth.

52:46.227 --> 52:47.595
It's your day of grieving.

52:48.097 --> 52:50.499
I just got a few questions,
the old routine stuff.

52:50.800 --> 52:52.034
What kind of questions?

52:52.267 --> 52:53.903
This concerns the
death of your ex-wife.

52:54.202 --> 52:57.405
By the way that was a
very lovely funeral.

52:57.840 --> 52:59.408
Well thank you very much.

53:02.544 --> 53:07.550
I didn't know you were there,
did someone invite you?

53:08.517 --> 53:10.019
No, no, I invited myself.

53:10.084 --> 53:13.987
Part of the job, sometimes
we attend the funeral

53:13.988 --> 53:16.391
of a murder victim
just to take a look.

53:16.858 --> 53:19.527
See who shows up, it's
not uncommon sometimes

53:19.528 --> 53:23.466
even for the killer to attend.

53:27.570 --> 53:31.372
Did you, did you say
murder victim, Detective?

53:36.345 --> 53:39.747
My Thelma, she, well she
died of a heart attack.

53:40.883 --> 53:43.319
Yeah, we thought that
at first, but the coroner

53:43.320 --> 53:48.323
he found traces of
cyanide in her lungs.

53:48.590 --> 53:49.757
Now how crazy is that?

53:49.758 --> 53:52.461
Your ex-wife being
murdered like that.

54:09.077 --> 54:11.579
Murdered? Cyanide?

54:14.582 --> 54:16.619
Are you absolutely certain
of that, Detective?

54:16.684 --> 54:17.719
Yeah, I'm quite sure.

54:31.332 --> 54:32.535
You okay?

54:36.271 --> 54:38.306
Who on earth would
want to kill my Thelma?

54:40.441 --> 54:42.042
Mr. Kelly, I'm sitting
here kind of hoping

54:42.043 --> 54:45.046
you'd help me figure that out?

57:29.345 --> 57:31.914
All right, look,
I'm not a cop, man.

57:32.046 --> 57:33.247
I'm not going to
hurt you, all right.

57:34.650 --> 57:36.050
Look, I'm gonna lift
the lid a little.

57:36.818 --> 57:37.585
Be cool.

57:40.521 --> 57:41.322
What do you want?

57:41.423 --> 57:42.491
Nothing man, nothing.

57:42.890 --> 57:44.092
Hey, you're the guy that shot

57:44.093 --> 57:45.294
the convenience store
clerk back there?

57:46.260 --> 57:47.362
You saw that?

57:47.428 --> 57:48.863
Yeah man, it was awesome.

57:48.930 --> 57:50.499
Somebody called the cops,
they're on their way.

57:52.300 --> 57:54.302
Goddammit, what can I do?

57:55.104 --> 57:56.538
Think they'll find me in here?

57:56.838 --> 57:58.407
Probably man, I mean they
always look in dumpsters.

57:59.273 --> 58:00.375
Your plan was kind of weak.

58:00.441 --> 58:02.244
Plan, what plan?

58:02.677 --> 58:03.877
Why'd I shoot that guy?

58:03.878 --> 58:05.279
He already gave me the money.

58:14.356 --> 58:18.494
I just need a fix,
can you help me?

58:21.430 --> 58:23.432
Yeah man, I can help
you, I can ease your pain.

58:25.800 --> 58:27.769
Okay, please help
me out of this shit.

58:28.537 --> 58:29.838
Hey who, what's
that on your neck?

58:30.005 --> 58:31.039
I got like a bug or something?

59:02.604 --> 59:03.739
Nighty night.

59:25.293 --> 59:26.494
Crap.

59:37.171 --> 59:38.206
Hello?

59:38.606 --> 59:40.041
Buddy, hey, it's Stan.

59:42.043 --> 59:43.811
He's kind of dopey
Billy, you know.

59:43.945 --> 59:45.713
I mean, he talked real slow.

59:46.113 --> 59:47.316
Here, here.

59:48.249 --> 59:50.351
If he's so dopey, why
did he come see you?

59:51.352 --> 59:53.521
I don't know, it was
pretty informal, really.

59:53.921 --> 59:55.023
Routine he said, yeah.

59:55.523 --> 59:57.124
Hell, he even
picked up the check.

59:57.358 --> 59:59.527
You had an informal
meeting with the detective?

59:59.894 --> 01:00:01.395
It was just some
questions about Thelma.

01:00:01.396 --> 01:00:03.298
You know, when's the
last time I saw her?

01:00:03.398 --> 01:00:06.401
That was one, did anybody
have any problems with her?

01:00:06.568 --> 01:00:07.769
Yeah, that was another one.

01:00:08.003 --> 01:00:09.103
Here
at the convenience

01:00:09.104 --> 01:00:10.304
store
But you know

01:00:10.305 --> 01:00:12.072
he did mention the
cyanide though.

01:00:12.073 --> 01:00:13.842
He mentioned
the cyanide, Stan?

01:00:14.343 --> 01:00:17.646
You told me cyanide was
undetectable, you said that.

01:00:17.813 --> 01:00:18.947
Well that's
what I thought.

01:00:19.012 --> 01:00:19.914
That's what you thought?

01:00:19.915 --> 01:00:21.082
Yeah

01:00:21.148 --> 01:00:22.550
You didn't
know it for sure?

01:00:22.617 --> 01:00:24.018
Sir, there
was some speculation earlier

01:00:24.019 --> 01:00:25.754
that the killer of the
convenience store shooter

01:00:25.755 --> 01:00:27.654
from earlier this
afternoon may have been

01:00:27.655 --> 01:00:28.990
the work from "The Dart Man"?

01:00:29.224 --> 01:00:30.492
It's a routine investigation,
that's what he said.

01:00:31.492 --> 01:00:32.960
Buddy, there ain't
nothing routine

01:00:32.961 --> 01:00:35.664
about Thelma's death now
that they've found cyanide.

01:00:37.064 --> 01:00:38.266
How many people do you think

01:00:38.267 --> 01:00:40.402
die naturally of
cyanide poisoning?

01:00:41.369 --> 01:00:43.971
If you would stop glamorizing
him into being some kind

01:00:43.972 --> 01:00:45.940
of super hero, because he's not.

01:00:45.941 --> 01:00:48.208
People, we have, we
have a pathetic loser

01:00:48.209 --> 01:00:50.844
here on the loose
who is randomingly

01:00:50.845 --> 01:00:53.715
killing people for the
sheer pleasure of it.

01:00:54.215 --> 01:00:56.183
For a dopey guy, he's
doing a pretty smart job.

01:00:57.119 --> 01:00:58.854
Soon he'll be wanting
to have coffee with me.

01:01:00.421 --> 01:01:04.927
Well he kind of sort of
did ask me who you were.

01:01:05.827 --> 01:01:08.530
But I know he seemed more
interested in Flip, Billy.

01:01:08.664 --> 01:01:09.898
In Flip?

01:01:09.963 --> 01:01:12.132
Yeah, yeah, well I,
I guess he thinks he's,

01:01:12.133 --> 01:01:14.802
he looks more like a
criminal than I do.

01:01:15.137 --> 01:01:18.173
Yeah. He wants
to have coffee with him.

01:01:18.673 --> 01:01:19.806
Coffee, what coffee, what?

01:01:19.807 --> 01:01:21.677
What is it with
this guy and coffee?

01:01:22.077 --> 01:01:23.344
You have sacrificed here

01:01:23.345 --> 01:01:27.215
a moral imperative for
sheer sensationalism,

01:01:27.481 --> 01:01:29.418
and that is unacceptable,
unacceptable.

01:01:30.519 --> 01:01:32.553
Paul Jordan, good
night and good luck.

01:01:33.287 --> 01:01:34.689
You ask me if I'm close?

01:01:34.756 --> 01:01:36.525
I'm close to having a
nervous breakdown, thank you.

01:01:36.791 --> 01:01:38.125
I don't think there's
any reason to panic.

01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:39.461
I think we're going to be okay.

01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:42.930
No, we are not going
to be okay, Stan.

01:01:43.664 --> 01:01:44.967
I don't like the
sound of any of this.

01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:46.801
The fact that he's
already talked to you

01:01:46.802 --> 01:01:48.303
let's me know that he's onto us.

01:01:52.374 --> 01:01:54.443
Don't you think you're over
reacting just a little bit?

01:01:54.575 --> 01:01:58.280
No, no, I do not
think I'm over reacting.

01:01:58.914 --> 01:02:00.349
I think I'm under reacting.

01:02:02.184 --> 01:02:03.851
All the shit I got
going on at home

01:02:03.852 --> 01:02:05.621
and now you bring
this to my door, too.

01:02:07.289 --> 01:02:08.490
Your damned ex-wife.

01:02:09.523 --> 01:02:10.992
Don't matter whether
she's dead or alive,

01:02:11.059 --> 01:02:12.361
she's still fucking us both.

01:02:15.262 --> 01:02:17.297
You do not agree to any
more coffee meetings

01:02:17.298 --> 01:02:19.101
with this detective, right?

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:20.769
I don't care if he pays or not.

01:02:22.470 --> 01:02:24.206
You're under no
obligation to talk to him.

01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:30.311
Okay, I won't, but what
the hell are we going to do?

01:02:32.314 --> 01:02:33.482
I'll figure something out.

01:02:42.456 --> 01:02:43.391
Come in.

01:02:46.293 --> 01:02:47.461
You have a moment?

01:02:50.097 --> 01:02:51.233
Yeah, sure.

01:02:52.633 --> 01:02:54.101
We really need to talk.

01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:01.142
Okay, let's talk.

01:03:02.376 --> 01:03:03.311
Here?

01:03:04.345 --> 01:03:06.881
Yeah, what's wrong with here?

01:03:07.115 --> 01:03:08.582
Why not?

01:03:09.217 --> 01:03:12.921
Bill, it hasn't been so good
with us for quite a while.

01:03:14.856 --> 01:03:19.861
That's a shocker,
get to the point.

01:03:21.128 --> 01:03:24.865
All right, I want
you to move out.

01:03:25.934 --> 01:03:27.169
It can't go on like this.

01:03:34.543 --> 01:03:36.077
You want me to
move out of my house?

01:03:38.046 --> 01:03:41.216
You want me to move out of my
parents' house, are you crazy?

01:03:42.718 --> 01:03:45.319
I'm divorcing you,
Bill, you're gonna have

01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:47.055
to move out sooner or later.

01:03:47.255 --> 01:03:49.557
Is that right?
Who's the lucky guy?

01:03:50.624 --> 01:03:51.559
What are you talking about?

01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:52.760
There's no one else.

01:03:56.631 --> 01:03:58.467
I'll move out of this
house when I'm dead.

01:04:00.602 --> 01:04:01.837
Close the door.

01:04:04.572 --> 01:04:05.806
I'm sorry.

01:04:08.410 --> 01:04:10.645
Get your ridiculous
clown face out of here.

01:04:20.889 --> 01:04:22.289
Hey it's Bill, isn't it?

01:04:24.358 --> 01:04:25.459
Do I know you?

01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:27.963
Not if you don't watch TV

01:04:29.631 --> 01:04:31.032
No sir, I don't.

01:04:31.398 --> 01:04:34.468
That's okay, we can't
arrest you for that, right?

01:04:35.537 --> 01:04:36.938
I'm Paul Jordan, a detective.

01:04:37.606 --> 01:04:38.840
This is Detective Brent.

01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:42.610
Yeah, that's some cool
rig you got here Billy.

01:04:43.912 --> 01:04:45.781
What, are you in the
extermination business, man?

01:04:47.481 --> 01:04:49.184
No sir, I'm in fire safety.

01:04:49.617 --> 01:04:54.622
Yeah, what? Now
that's 30 years on the job?

01:04:56.992 --> 01:05:00.528
Shit, the older
I get, the worst I see.

01:05:01.296 --> 01:05:02.531
I thought I saw the worst.

01:05:03.798 --> 01:05:05.031
Hey gentlemen,
if you don't mind,

01:05:05.032 --> 01:05:06.433
I got places to be,
I'm a schedule today.

01:05:06.568 --> 01:05:09.171
Hey, don't let us hold
you, go split, that's cool.

01:05:10.137 --> 01:05:14.409
But you know, you're not,
you're not curious, man.

01:05:15.610 --> 01:05:16.544
How I know your name?

01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:18.914
No sir.

01:05:19.180 --> 01:05:20.115
No?

01:05:21.249 --> 01:05:24.252
How about you, Brent? Curious?

01:05:25.287 --> 01:05:26.788
Yeah, I find it
extremely curious.

01:05:27.722 --> 01:05:31.293
Well, I assumed
you ran my plates.

01:05:31.860 --> 01:05:33.027
No, I didn't need to.

01:05:33.028 --> 01:05:34.396
Your buddy Stan, he
gave me your name.

01:05:34.662 --> 01:05:35.996
He's cool, I like Stan.

01:05:36.298 --> 01:05:38.400
We had a long chat,
yeah, very cool.

01:05:38.633 --> 01:05:40.135
Yeah, Stan's a great guy.

01:05:40.434 --> 01:05:42.637
Yeah, but he didn't
mention me to you?

01:05:44.072 --> 01:05:44.872
No sir.

01:05:45.106 --> 01:05:47.374
Bam! I'm disappointed.

01:05:49.711 --> 01:05:52.981
That's wild, yeah.

01:05:59.454 --> 01:06:01.323
So, what is it with
you and Stanley then?

01:06:01.389 --> 01:06:04.258
You're not, you're not
particularly close?

01:06:06.260 --> 01:06:07.963
We've been friends
for years, we're close.

01:06:08.697 --> 01:06:09.664
But you don't talk?

01:06:10.865 --> 01:06:12.367
Yeah, we talk, yeah.

01:06:12.432 --> 01:06:13.901
Well, I mean, there's
things you don't talk about?

01:06:16.371 --> 01:06:18.106
I'm not his wife, Detective.

01:06:18.372 --> 01:06:19.608
Well, that's
probably a good thing.

01:06:19.707 --> 01:06:24.713
He's already had three.

01:06:26.447 --> 01:06:27.614
Hey gentlemen, do you mind,

01:06:27.615 --> 01:06:28.849
could we get to
the point, please?

01:06:29.217 --> 01:06:30.750
Shit, there's no
point, there's no point.

01:06:30.751 --> 01:06:32.219
We're going to go.

01:06:33.287 --> 01:06:35.556
No, I'm not gonna rain on
the parade, so to speak, man.

01:06:35.622 --> 01:06:37.123
But I'll tell you something
I could not do your job, man.

01:06:37.124 --> 01:06:39.058
Being on the road all
day, all day with assholes

01:06:39.059 --> 01:06:43.430
Breathing their shit,
I'd snap, I'd snap.

01:06:43.898 --> 01:06:48.903
Fuck it, I'd take a few of
them out, yes siree bob!

01:06:52.606 --> 01:06:54.175
It's frustrating
some days, yeah.

01:06:55.876 --> 01:06:56.977
I like to drive.

01:06:57.646 --> 01:06:58.446
Yeah?

01:06:58.546 --> 01:06:59.614
People aren't so bad.

01:07:06.454 --> 01:07:09.624
Man, that is beautiful.

01:07:12.827 --> 01:07:14.729
Somebody's been a bad boy.

01:07:15.563 --> 01:07:16.965
You drinkin' and drivin' Billy?

01:07:18.265 --> 01:07:22.369
You been a bad boy?

01:07:22.537 --> 01:07:23.538
You got a problem
with the sauce?

01:07:27.409 --> 01:07:28.443
Not any more.

01:07:34.648 --> 01:07:35.849
You gentlemen have a good day.

01:07:36.751 --> 01:07:37.953
You too, Bill.

01:07:38.552 --> 01:07:40.721
Think about it, man,
we'll see you soon.

01:08:22.863 --> 01:08:26.533
Bill, someone's at the
door, can you see who it is?

01:08:26.667 --> 01:08:27.736
Shut up, Vera.

01:08:33.674 --> 01:08:34.942
Billy boy.

01:08:41.683 --> 01:08:43.084
Is everything all right here?

01:08:44.018 --> 01:08:45.452
What?

01:08:46.054 --> 01:08:47.886
I've been knocking here
for five minutes, you know.

01:08:47.888 --> 01:08:49.555
You certainly take
your goddamned time.

01:08:49.622 --> 01:08:51.692
Is there something here going
on that I don't know about?

01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:53.194
You all right?

01:08:54.828 --> 01:08:56.598
Detective, do you
know what time it is?

01:08:57.098 --> 01:08:58.433
Yeah, it's five
after midnight.

01:08:59.533 --> 01:09:01.000
You make a habit
of visiting suspects

01:09:01.001 --> 01:09:02.703
at five after midnight?

01:09:02.769 --> 01:09:04.737
Suspect? What are
you talking about?

01:09:04.738 --> 01:09:05.971
You consider yourself a suspect.

01:09:05.973 --> 01:09:07.174
Suspect, for what?

01:09:07.541 --> 01:09:08.875
You done something I
need to know about?

01:09:08.876 --> 01:09:10.243
No! You been a bad boy?

01:09:10.245 --> 01:09:11.813
No! I'm here.

01:09:12.513 --> 01:09:14.080
When a guy gets a
visit from the police

01:09:14.081 --> 01:09:16.651
after midnight, he tends
to assume the worst.

01:09:17.719 --> 01:09:19.354
Yeah, well, you know,
that ain't a bad point,

01:09:19.354 --> 01:09:21.319
but you know, not
when the visit is

01:09:21.321 --> 01:09:23.357
in an unofficial capacity,
don't give me that shit.

01:09:24.858 --> 01:09:26.428
Unofficial capacity?

01:09:26.827 --> 01:09:27.761
Yeah.

01:09:28.362 --> 01:09:29.798
Detective, what do you want?

01:09:31.698 --> 01:09:33.067
You said you liked to drive.

01:09:33.201 --> 01:09:34.301
I drove over here.

01:09:34.602 --> 01:09:36.438
I brought my truck,
I got my rig.

01:09:36.970 --> 01:09:38.572
You showed me your rig,
I want to show you mine.

01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:41.341
That's all, we'll
go for a drive.

01:09:41.608 --> 01:09:43.010
You want me to
look at your truck?

01:09:44.612 --> 01:09:46.915
Yeah, I drove it
all the way over here.

01:09:47.881 --> 01:09:50.417
Five after midnight you
want me to look at your truck?

01:09:51.018 --> 01:09:53.420
Billy, you see that rocker?

01:09:55.156 --> 01:09:58.026
I'm only rockin',
when you're ready.

01:10:09.003 --> 01:10:10.004
So what do you think?

01:10:13.340 --> 01:10:14.875
These are the streets, Bill.

01:10:17.045 --> 01:10:18.246
What streets?

01:10:18.979 --> 01:10:22.784
The streets I drove
twenty years, man.

01:10:24.052 --> 01:10:27.822
Most of my soul grew right here.

01:10:30.390 --> 01:10:33.728
Yeah, most of my soul.

01:10:34.929 --> 01:10:36.965
You don't mind if I
call you Bill, do you?

01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:40.567
No, everybody else does.

01:10:40.902 --> 01:10:44.405
Yeah. That's
funny stuff, man.

01:10:44.539 --> 01:10:47.207
That's
funny shit, you know.

01:10:47.642 --> 01:10:49.476
I got to do more of that
funny stuff back, you know.

01:10:49.477 --> 01:10:52.780
Everybody else does.

01:10:53.281 --> 01:10:56.985
Shit.

01:11:04.925 --> 01:11:06.126
You see that place?

01:11:08.162 --> 01:11:12.767
That's bad people, Bill,
I mean bad.

01:11:12.832 --> 01:11:14.536
We'll burn that to the
ground, you and me.

01:11:15.036 --> 01:11:19.207
With every one in
it, nobody cares.

01:11:21.276 --> 01:11:24.879
And I mean nobody.

01:11:25.179 --> 01:11:26.346
You see what I'm saying?

01:11:26.347 --> 01:11:27.514
I'm still loving the
skunks here, man.

01:11:28.348 --> 01:11:29.883
It's the funny stuff, you know,

01:11:29.884 --> 01:11:32.320
the funny stuff,
it just slips away.

01:11:32.385 --> 01:11:35.990
It all comes from a place,
you know, the rage and shit.

01:11:36.924 --> 01:11:39.059
Rage, you know rage, right?

01:11:40.827 --> 01:11:42.229
Sure is a scary area.

01:11:42.563 --> 01:11:45.900
I don't know, I think
it's not scarier than this.

01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:13.795
So what's going on, Detective?

01:12:16.964 --> 01:12:18.365
Why the hell did
you bring me here?

01:12:25.973 --> 01:12:26.973
You know, I got
to get home, I got

01:12:26.974 --> 01:12:28.175
to work in the morning.

01:12:29.244 --> 01:12:33.214
I know, you got
to exterminate.

01:12:34.682 --> 01:12:36.150
You got to exterminate problems.

01:12:36.451 --> 01:12:37.750
I'm in fire safety.

01:12:37.751 --> 01:12:39.387
I'm talking about
those bugs, Billy.

01:12:39.554 --> 01:12:42.257
Those bugs, who is going
to exterminate them?

01:12:42.389 --> 01:12:44.157
Cause somebody's got to do
something before it's too late.

01:12:45.226 --> 01:12:46.893
They got to be
exterminated, you know.

01:12:47.562 --> 01:12:51.198
Like crops
just like that.

01:12:53.334 --> 01:12:55.769
That's how you exterminate
them, not with poisons.

01:12:56.170 --> 01:12:58.840
Now you got to watch, you
know, you cut and run.

01:13:00.241 --> 01:13:01.442
You got to watch, man.

01:13:01.508 --> 01:13:04.746
You got to watch,
that life just leaves.

01:13:06.613 --> 01:13:10.884
That's a high, it
really is a high.

01:13:15.857 --> 01:13:18.092
This is a high like there's
nothing else on Earth.

01:13:25.299 --> 01:13:26.500
You up for it, Billy?

01:13:27.802 --> 01:13:29.269
Think you mad like me?

01:13:31.638 --> 01:13:34.976
You ready to
exterminate?

01:13:37.045 --> 01:13:39.147
Maybe you want to go
after the big bugs?

01:13:40.214 --> 01:13:41.948
The black colored
mother fuckers!

01:13:42.014 --> 01:13:46.553
Yeah, the mood calls, crush
them into the goddamned floor.

01:13:46.620 --> 01:13:50.191
You don't need them, we're a
team, we'll make a difference.

01:13:50.424 --> 01:13:53.561
Be like Gods! Be like Gods!

01:13:56.830 --> 01:13:58.031
What do you say?

01:14:00.335 --> 01:14:02.203
I'm not so sure
about that, Detective.

01:14:03.338 --> 01:14:04.505
Paul!

01:14:06.874 --> 01:14:09.376
I call you Bill,
you call me Paul.

01:14:10.945 --> 01:14:12.280
Okay, Paul.

01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:13.947
Good.

01:14:19.586 --> 01:14:20.588
You see that shit?

01:14:20.787 --> 01:14:21.755
That's what I'm talking about.

01:14:21.756 --> 01:14:23.022
You gonna let that shit slide?

01:14:23.023 --> 01:14:23.990
You gonna let it slide, are we?

01:14:23.991 --> 01:14:26.427
No fuckin' way, why Billy, why?

01:14:26.693 --> 01:14:29.731
I tell you why, cause they
don't own the goddamned street.

01:14:29.796 --> 01:14:31.499
We do! You get it?

01:14:33.901 --> 01:14:37.104
Look, I got to
get home, all right?

01:14:37.537 --> 01:14:39.240
I ain't gonna take this shit.

01:14:39.674 --> 01:14:40.640
What do I got to do?

01:14:40.641 --> 01:14:41.941
I'm gonna show you a real man

01:14:41.942 --> 01:14:44.378
exterminates real
vermin and real quick.

01:14:45.012 --> 01:14:47.314
You watch! You watch!

01:14:50.050 --> 01:14:51.686
Come here mother fucker!

01:15:11.705 --> 01:15:13.273
What the fuck?

01:15:25.119 --> 01:15:26.586
The fuck?

01:15:42.536 --> 01:15:43.838
And that's how
you do it, Bill.

01:15:44.871 --> 01:15:46.173
That's how the
professionals do it.

01:15:46.374 --> 01:15:47.841
You know, not with
this chicken shit.

01:15:47.842 --> 01:15:52.813
Using a blow dart, a blow dart,
I got a blow dart.

01:15:53.313 --> 01:15:54.247
I'm gonna blow you to death.

01:15:54.313 --> 01:15:55.549
Get the fuck outta here, man.

01:15:56.250 --> 01:15:57.485
That's for pussies.

01:15:57.718 --> 01:16:00.854
Shit, come on man, you're turn.

01:16:03.457 --> 01:16:04.724
My turn for what?

01:16:05.026 --> 01:16:06.193
Crush some bugs.

01:16:06.794 --> 01:16:08.396
Come on, pick one
out, kick some ass.

01:16:09.464 --> 01:16:10.996
Pick one out and kick some ass.

01:16:10.997 --> 01:16:12.098
I don't think so.

01:16:12.165 --> 01:16:13.434
Yes, crush a bug!

01:16:15.803 --> 01:16:16.804
I don't think so.

01:16:18.039 --> 01:16:19.273
Get out of my truck.

01:16:19.372 --> 01:16:20.308
What?

01:16:20.374 --> 01:16:21.342
I said get out of my truck.

01:16:22.576 --> 01:16:23.510
What the hell?

01:16:24.612 --> 01:16:26.380
Fuck, piece of shit.

01:16:26.513 --> 01:16:28.815
Jesus, what are ya doing?

01:16:29.317 --> 01:16:30.284
Get the fuck out

01:16:30.285 --> 01:16:31.184
-of my truck.
-What!

01:16:31.185 --> 01:16:32.119
What the hell are you doing?

01:16:35.990 --> 01:16:37.390
You having a crisis, Billy?

01:16:38.159 --> 01:16:39.360
You having a crisis?

01:16:39.794 --> 01:16:41.429
You have a little
crisis of a conscience?

01:16:42.597 --> 01:16:44.165
My conscience is fine.

01:16:44.732 --> 01:16:46.200
I'm not into hurting people.

01:16:46.433 --> 01:16:47.868
Don't give me that shit.

01:16:47.869 --> 01:16:49.504
We're not talking about
people, those are the insects.

01:16:49.870 --> 01:16:50.770
You got to crush a bug, Billy.

01:16:50.771 --> 01:16:53.139
Yeah, you gonna crush a bug.

01:16:54.008 --> 01:16:55.142
I'm not doing it.

01:16:55.207 --> 01:16:56.376
Yeah, you're
gonna crush a bug.

01:16:56.576 --> 01:16:57.944
-Come on, come on.
-I'm not

01:16:57.945 --> 01:16:59.212
doing it!

01:16:59.213 --> 01:16:59.981
Yeah, you're gonna do
it, cause you know why?

01:16:59.982 --> 01:17:00.747
Cause you promised.

01:17:00.748 --> 01:17:02.115
I didn't promise.

01:17:02.116 --> 01:17:04.619
Yeah, you promised, yeah,
yeah, you promised.

01:17:04.684 --> 01:17:05.652
You said it, you said it.

01:17:05.653 --> 01:17:06.820
I didn't promise you.

01:17:06.987 --> 01:17:09.222
We're partners,
we're partners.

01:17:09.924 --> 01:17:11.458
We're not partners, Detective.

01:17:11.459 --> 01:17:13.995
Paul! Paul!

01:17:18.799 --> 01:17:20.001
I'm going home.

01:17:20.101 --> 01:17:21.268
What did you say to me?

01:17:21.969 --> 01:17:24.272
I'm going home,
I can't do this.

01:17:24.371 --> 01:17:25.472
I'm going home.

01:17:26.439 --> 01:17:27.741
You going home, Billy boy?

01:17:35.448 --> 01:17:37.018
Are you good with
a blow dart, Billy?

01:17:37.518 --> 01:17:40.588
Please! Please!

01:17:40.687 --> 01:17:41.621
Are you good with a blow dart?

01:17:41.622 --> 01:17:42.622
Please!

01:17:43.357 --> 01:17:44.559
That's interesting.

01:17:44.825 --> 01:17:46.027
No.

01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:48.662
That's really real,
real interesting.

01:17:58.572 --> 01:18:02.343
Hey, you're good.

01:18:03.678 --> 01:18:07.814
Yeah, you're good and ready.

01:18:12.753 --> 01:18:13.821
Billy boy.

01:18:43.183 --> 01:18:47.554
Boy!

01:19:11.379 --> 01:19:14.482
Jesus, Billy, boy,
you look like hell.

01:19:15.215 --> 01:19:18.318
No, I look
like hell.

01:19:19.553 --> 01:19:24.558
Good God, it's 3
AM, what's going on?

01:19:26.594 --> 01:19:27.994
I just spent the evening

01:19:27.995 --> 01:19:30.231
with your coffee
loving detective.

01:19:30.731 --> 01:19:34.168
And for a stupid guy, he
pretty much knows everything.

01:19:34.768 --> 01:19:38.438
He's about this close to
sending us both to jail.

01:19:39.839 --> 01:19:41.641
He's got nothing on us, Billy.

01:19:44.945 --> 01:19:48.381
He's nuts! He's scary nuts.

01:19:49.015 --> 01:19:51.686
And he ain't gonna stop
until he's buried us both.

01:19:53.187 --> 01:19:54.555
He's harmless, Bill.

01:19:55.022 --> 01:19:58.793
He just took me down
town, in an ice cream truck,

01:19:59.393 --> 01:20:01.662
and tried to goad me
into hurting somebody,

01:20:02.228 --> 01:20:04.364
to, to confirm his suspicions

01:20:04.365 --> 01:20:06.233
that I'm the killer
he's looking for.

01:20:07.902 --> 01:20:10.404
He even beat up his own
partner to make his point.

01:20:11.004 --> 01:20:12.172
He's nuts.

01:20:15.342 --> 01:20:20.347
Yeah that,
that is a problem.

01:20:26.554 --> 01:20:29.090
So what, what are you gonna do?

01:20:29.456 --> 01:20:34.461
No!

01:20:35.562 --> 01:20:38.598
What, what are we gonna do?

01:20:39.400 --> 01:20:41.268
That's it, what are we gonna do?

01:20:56.916 --> 01:21:00.019
I'm coming, I'm coming,
you impatient bastard.

01:21:05.092 --> 01:21:07.294
Stan the man,
put it there bro.

01:21:07.460 --> 01:21:08.896
Big Boy, thanks for coming.

01:21:09.562 --> 01:21:13.967
Yeah, get in here,
so how's it going?

01:21:14.468 --> 01:21:15.970
If I told you the
truth, you'd be green

01:21:15.971 --> 01:21:18.371
with envy and want
to kill yourself.

01:21:18.437 --> 01:21:20.406
Yeah, yeah, I know,
it sucks to be me.

01:21:20.775 --> 01:21:22.343
Yeah, yeah.

01:21:24.277 --> 01:21:28.048
So well hell you're lookin'
mighty fit there Big Boy.

01:21:28.182 --> 01:21:29.683
I got to tell ya.

01:21:29.749 --> 01:21:32.452
All that exercise shit must
be really working out for you?

01:21:34.687 --> 01:21:36.623
Yeah, it's working out.

01:21:38.424 --> 01:21:41.561
Ain't exactly shittin' pounds,
but I'm having a ball trying.

01:21:41.896 --> 01:21:46.267
Yeah, yeah.
You know I, I hear that.

01:21:48.268 --> 01:21:52.173
Yeah Vee, she's, well she's
a real fun lady, ain't she?

01:21:55.276 --> 01:21:59.246
She is, indeed, lots of fun.

01:22:00.113 --> 01:22:01.514
Lot of fun?

01:22:06.253 --> 01:22:10.191
I'm awful sorry about Thelma,
you must miss her a lot.

01:22:12.058 --> 01:22:15.361
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:22:16.397 --> 01:22:19.500
Things are definitely different.

01:22:20.634 --> 01:22:22.770
Now that she's
gone and all, yeah.

01:22:24.772 --> 01:22:26.941
Sure bro, that gal was
a habit hard to break.

01:22:28.776 --> 01:22:33.781
Yeah, yeah, say you know I've
always been a little curious

01:22:36.250 --> 01:22:41.021
Were you two you
know ever a thing?

01:22:41.688 --> 01:22:45.726
You know, you know, yeah.

01:22:45.791 --> 01:22:47.260
You mean way back when?

01:22:47.326 --> 01:22:49.495
Yeah, yeah, you know, back
when you hand balled her to me.

01:22:51.365 --> 01:22:52.099
Yeah.

01:23:06.013 --> 01:23:07.214
Sure we were.

01:23:09.349 --> 01:23:11.184
Tell you the truth
about that one, buddy.

01:23:13.987 --> 01:23:16.956
Thelma would never let me plow
the Hershey highway, right.

01:23:17.924 --> 01:23:21.427
I was pretty cool with
it for a while anyway.

01:23:23.397 --> 01:23:25.466
She had every right
to deny the Big Boy

01:23:25.467 --> 01:23:27.767
access to the promised land.

01:23:28.434 --> 01:23:31.839
And I had the right to
seek access elsewhere.

01:23:32.572 --> 01:23:34.841
So when I found it it
was just about time

01:23:34.842 --> 01:23:37.244
to say bye-bye baby to Thel.

01:23:38.512 --> 01:23:39.813
That's when you happened along.

01:23:43.150 --> 01:23:45.585
Now that what
you're saying is

01:23:47.388 --> 01:23:50.189
I broke her in
actually?

01:23:52.393 --> 01:23:55.262
Well, not exactly.

01:23:56.930 --> 01:23:59.265
On the morning of the
night you first showed up,

01:23:59.866 --> 01:24:04.804
she finally gave me all
access pass

01:24:07.340 --> 01:24:10.375
Course I was already a month
into my new relationship

01:24:10.376 --> 01:24:13.446
by then, so didn't
mean shit, so to speak.

01:24:16.416 --> 01:24:19.518
Well that
definitely does suck

01:24:19.519 --> 01:24:20.920
to be me then, doesn't it?

01:24:25.992 --> 01:24:27.361
I guess so.

01:24:27.628 --> 01:24:29.429
Hey, after I take a piddle,
you want to get high?

01:24:29.796 --> 01:24:31.165
A little

01:24:31.397 --> 01:24:33.099
Yeah, yeah, sure, why not?

01:24:34.168 --> 01:24:35.602
Certainly couldn't hurt.

01:24:37.771 --> 01:24:41.140
The switch, the light
switch it's on the wall there.

01:24:41.607 --> 01:24:42.775
Yep, got it.

01:24:44.344 --> 01:24:45.611
All right, yep.

01:25:02.495 --> 01:25:07.500
Come on, there you go
promise land.

01:26:21.375 --> 01:26:22.309
Hey Vee!

01:26:22.476 --> 01:26:24.445
Stan, what are you doing here?

01:26:27.781 --> 01:26:29.249
Billy's not an
idiot, you know?

01:26:34.153 --> 01:26:37.723
He knows all about you and Flip.

01:26:38.291 --> 01:26:39.492
What do you mean?

01:26:39.558 --> 01:26:41.061
What the hell are
you talking about?

01:26:41.594 --> 01:26:44.697
And the money,
yeah, the money.

01:26:49.303 --> 01:26:51.738
Ouch, what is this?

01:26:52.004 --> 01:26:53.773
You were never good
enough for Billy, Vee.

01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:57.844
He deserves so much
better than you.

01:26:58.211 --> 01:26:59.112
Please.

01:26:59.312 --> 01:27:02.014
Don't bother, you're done.

01:28:47.554 --> 01:28:48.722
Bill?

01:28:50.022 --> 01:28:52.458
What are you, what
are you doing here?

01:28:52.893 --> 01:28:54.394
What's up?

01:28:56.028 --> 01:29:01.034
Jesus, I've been looking
everywhere for that bad boy.

01:29:01.567 --> 01:29:02.635
Where did you find it?

01:29:02.936 --> 01:29:03.970
You left it in Stan's.

01:29:05.205 --> 01:29:06.974
Stan, Stan.

01:29:12.112 --> 01:29:14.213
You wanna, you wanna come in?

01:29:14.214 --> 01:29:15.682
I just made some coffee.

01:29:17.550 --> 01:29:19.785
Sure, what could it hurt?

01:29:40.040 --> 01:29:40.974
You take cream?

01:29:41.308 --> 01:29:42.809
I like to live dangerously.

01:29:43.210 --> 01:29:44.410
Me too.

01:29:44.411 --> 01:29:46.513
It should be my motto,
careful, it's hot.

01:29:48.848 --> 01:29:49.849
Vee says hey

01:29:50.217 --> 01:29:54.187
Cool, tell her I say hey.

01:29:56.723 --> 01:29:57.890
How's it going with Vee?

01:29:59.058 --> 01:30:01.227
Losing weight,
reaching your goals?

01:30:03.530 --> 01:30:06.166
You know, to be
honest man, it's tough.

01:30:07.067 --> 01:30:09.369
I'm still eating like a slob,
so that doesn't help things.

01:30:14.540 --> 01:30:15.708
What about the sex?

01:30:16.143 --> 01:30:16.843
Sorry?

01:30:17.244 --> 01:30:18.144
The sex.

01:30:18.844 --> 01:30:20.280
What are ya talking about?

01:30:22.581 --> 01:30:25.518
The sex, Flip, you know.

01:30:27.387 --> 01:30:31.524
Where you take your penis,
insert it into my wife's vagina,

01:30:31.525 --> 01:30:34.428
thrust it vigorously
back and forth.

01:30:35.362 --> 01:30:36.797
That's the sex.

01:30:38.397 --> 01:30:41.000
My question is, are you
losing any weight doing that?

01:30:41.567 --> 01:30:44.204
Jesus, it was her idea man.

01:30:46.540 --> 01:30:47.541
I didn't want to do it.

01:30:48.942 --> 01:30:50.610
I was never comfortable.

01:30:51.911 --> 01:30:54.680
I told her it wouldn't end well.

01:30:56.116 --> 01:30:57.284
Just answer the
question, Flip.

01:30:57.951 --> 01:30:59.552
Are you losing weight
fucking my wife?

01:30:59.553 --> 01:31:02.656
No, no, no, I'm not
losing any weight.

01:31:03.022 --> 01:31:04.156
Then what's the point?

01:31:04.624 --> 01:31:06.059
She's a lousy lay.

01:31:06.826 --> 01:31:10.629
Bill, I didn't
know what to say, buddy.

01:31:11.365 --> 01:31:13.332
It's over, I'll stop.

01:31:13.933 --> 01:31:17.838
I'll never touch her again
or contact her.

01:31:18.205 --> 01:31:19.506
You don't understand.

01:31:21.441 --> 01:31:22.776
I don't want you to stop.

01:31:23.809 --> 01:31:25.010
You're welcome to her.

01:31:26.278 --> 01:31:27.713
I was done with
that shit years ago.

01:31:27.714 --> 01:31:29.683
I just didn't have the
balls to cut it off.

01:31:31.585 --> 01:31:35.454
You will not stop
fucking my wife!

01:31:35.455 --> 01:31:36.189
You got that?

01:31:36.423 --> 01:31:37.290
What?

01:31:38.023 --> 01:31:39.092
I'm giving her to you.

01:31:41.094 --> 01:31:44.097
She's yours, I'm
transferring ownership.

01:31:45.365 --> 01:31:48.068
God, this is crazy.

01:31:48.701 --> 01:31:50.369
Think of it as an
early Christmas present.

01:31:52.906 --> 01:31:54.775
I don't understand.

01:31:55.275 --> 01:31:56.476
I don't expect
you to understand.

01:31:57.710 --> 01:31:59.713
I forgot, I got
something for ya.

01:32:02.816 --> 01:32:03.717
Okay

01:32:13.826 --> 01:32:15.094
You mean, in your pocket?

01:32:15.829 --> 01:32:18.564
You want me to reach
in your, in your...

01:32:19.866 --> 01:32:23.170
guys, big deal,
straight, we like girls.

01:32:23.969 --> 01:32:25.971
Big deal, let me
get this, I got it.

01:32:25.972 --> 01:32:30.977
Okay, okay, reach into your
pocket, it's no big deal.

01:32:31.878 --> 01:32:34.848
What's this?

01:32:36.849 --> 01:32:40.320
This will exponentially
enhance your pleasure.

01:32:41.021 --> 01:32:42.120
Having sex not only with my wife

01:32:42.121 --> 01:32:43.756
but with other
men's wives as well.

01:32:43.857 --> 01:32:45.091
What the hell are...

01:32:45.092 --> 01:32:47.126
Shut up, you'll thank me later.

01:32:47.393 --> 01:32:49.396
Okay, okay, whatever you say.

01:32:50.330 --> 01:32:51.631
You like to get
high, don't you?

01:32:51.865 --> 01:32:54.968
Sure, sure
I'm the Big Boy.

01:32:55.067 --> 01:32:58.070
I always get high baby.

01:32:59.039 --> 01:33:00.206
It's gonna blow your mind.

01:33:00.307 --> 01:33:01.541
All right.

01:33:01.607 --> 01:33:04.311
Blow your mind, but
the ladies love it too.

01:33:04.411 --> 01:33:05.145
Okay.

01:33:05.210 --> 01:33:06.146
Yeah

01:33:07.379 --> 01:33:08.614
See you just open your mouth,

01:33:10.483 --> 01:33:15.488
yeah put in there, give
yourself two squirts.

01:33:21.393 --> 01:33:22.595
Yeah?

01:33:23.196 --> 01:33:24.731
It's like a time machine
back to the sixties,

01:33:26.031 --> 01:33:29.468
so just relax, ride the wave.

01:34:47.313 --> 01:34:49.081
Sweet dreams Big Boy.

01:34:56.455 --> 01:34:57.389
Surely goodness

01:34:57.390 --> 01:35:00.259
and mercy

01:35:28.388 --> 01:35:30.623
He shall receive
blessings from the Lord,

01:35:30.624 --> 01:35:33.893
righteousness of God
and his salvation.

01:35:35.260 --> 01:35:36.629
He restoreth my soul.

01:35:36.963 --> 01:35:38.097
He leadeth me in the paths

01:35:38.098 --> 01:35:39.697
of righteousness
for his name's sake

01:35:39.698 --> 01:35:41.400
Yea, though I walk
through the valley

01:35:41.401 --> 01:35:43.669
of the shadow of death,
I will fear no evil,

01:35:43.670 --> 01:35:46.905
for thou art with me, thy rod
and thy staff they comfort me.

01:35:46.906 --> 01:35:49.240
Thou preparest a table before me

01:35:49.241 --> 01:35:51.177
in the presence of mine enemies.

01:35:51.478 --> 01:35:54.314
Thou anointest my head with
oil, my cup runneth over.

01:35:54.880 --> 01:35:56.815
Surely goodness and
mercy shall follow me

01:35:56.816 --> 01:35:59.084
all the days of my
life, and I shall dwell

01:35:59.085 --> 01:36:01.187
in the house of
the Lord for ever.

01:36:02.022 --> 01:36:03.857
Lord of Host, he is
the King of Glory.

01:36:06.526 --> 01:36:08.727
To thee Lord, do
I lift up my soul,

01:36:08.728 --> 01:36:12.966
my God trust in thee,
let me not be ashamed.

01:36:13.232 --> 01:36:15.768
Do not let my enemies
triumph over me.

01:36:22.808 --> 01:36:24.209
Thank you for coming, Mr. Lee.

01:36:24.811 --> 01:36:26.412
No problem, Johnson.

01:36:28.048 --> 01:36:29.581
No rest for wicked, Johnson.

01:36:30.316 --> 01:36:32.485
See you back at
work in two hour.

01:36:34.487 --> 01:36:35.422
What?

01:36:36.423 --> 01:36:37.890
Is there a problem, Johnson?

01:36:42.295 --> 01:36:45.632
Actually yes,
yes there is, yes.

01:36:47.534 --> 01:36:49.568
Johnson, you're too serious.

01:36:50.103 --> 01:36:55.108
Relax, I make joke, you take
week off, full pay.

01:37:03.116 --> 01:37:04.584
What the hell was that about?

01:37:05.852 --> 01:37:10.857
Apparently my boss is a
comedian but only at funerals.

01:37:25.237 --> 01:37:26.205
Thank you, man.

01:37:28.006 --> 01:37:29.108
I owed you one, buddy.

01:37:34.546 --> 01:37:35.881
I owe you a lot more.

01:37:38.050 --> 01:37:39.218
Take care pal.

01:37:48.795 --> 01:37:50.063
Are you okay?

01:37:51.263 --> 01:37:55.400
All right, I almost
forgot to give you this.

01:37:57.603 --> 01:37:58.972
Daddy, what's this for?

01:38:01.174 --> 01:38:02.976
I don't think I'm
going to need it anymore.

01:38:05.245 --> 01:38:06.679
I'm feeling a lot better.

01:38:09.848 --> 01:38:11.083
It's just you and me now.

01:38:12.152 --> 01:38:17.157
Yeah, I can live
with that, come on.

01:38:20.692 --> 01:38:21.893
The Dart
Man, whose real name

01:38:21.894 --> 01:38:23.361
is Flip Feinstein,
took his own life

01:38:23.362 --> 01:38:26.064
after killing Vera Johnson,
his personal trainer.

01:38:26.432 --> 01:38:28.066
Cell phone records
and a business card

01:38:28.067 --> 01:38:30.837
placed Mr. Feinstein at the
scene of the final murder.

01:38:31.237 --> 01:38:33.506
Poison, a box of darts
and a blowpipe were

01:38:33.507 --> 01:38:35.842
also recovered from
the Dart Man's...

01:38:36.209 --> 01:38:38.077
Guess is wasn't that
Johnson guy after all?

01:38:40.412 --> 01:38:41.781
You were wrong this time, boss.

01:38:43.650 --> 01:38:48.655
It appears that way,
especially with the blinds.

01:38:53.058 --> 01:38:55.260
I was real sorry to hear
about your wife, Bill.

01:38:56.062 --> 01:38:58.965
Thank you, doc, it was rough
but we're getting though it.

01:38:59.999 --> 01:39:03.269
You know, all things considered,
you look damned good.

01:39:04.670 --> 01:39:05.871
I feel good.

01:39:06.472 --> 01:39:08.005
Looks like you
were able to remove

01:39:08.006 --> 01:39:10.309
those persistent
stresses in your life.

01:39:11.210 --> 01:39:12.512
How did you do it?

01:39:12.946 --> 01:39:14.214
Took your advice.

01:39:14.580 --> 01:39:16.748
And you were right, get
rid of the big problems.

01:39:18.116 --> 01:39:19.552
The small ones
don't mean nothing.

01:39:20.586 --> 01:39:21.588
Well, ain't that the truth.

01:39:22.589 --> 01:39:23.823
So what are your plans now?

01:39:25.357 --> 01:39:27.226
I'm just going to take
it one day at a time.

01:39:28.928 --> 01:39:30.363
You're a wise man, Bill.

01:39:31.129 --> 01:39:34.566
And whatever it is what
you've been doing, don't stop.
