01:46.246 --> 01:48.784
CENTER OF MY WORLD

01:59.593 --> 02:03.086
That's me. A totally normal country boy.

02:03.389 --> 02:07.349
Maybe a little gayer than most.
But still, quite standard.

02:08.060 --> 02:11.724
And this is what I do best.
Just hanging around, chilling,

02:12.064 --> 02:15.398
listening to music or spending
rainy afternoons in the library

02:16.819 --> 02:19.812
Or hanging around with Kat, my best friend.
Stealing fruit and berries,

02:20.155 --> 02:22.192
making ice cream,
and then obviously eating it.

02:23.033 --> 02:24.365
And that's my family.

02:24.660 --> 02:26.652
My mum, Glass, although to call
her mum is quite a stretch.

02:27.287 --> 02:28.027
And my sis, Dianne.

02:29.248 --> 02:33.162
Dianne and I used to be like... Like
MacGyver and his pocketknife, like asparagus

02:33.460 --> 02:36.077
and hollandaise sauce or, just
like the Olsen twins

02:36.338 --> 02:38.500
she was my everything,
my best friend, my ally.

02:38.799 --> 02:40.461
And I was her kindred spirit.

02:42.428 --> 02:45.887
and this is where we live.
Inherited from a great aunt or something.

02:46.181 --> 02:50.972
It's called Visible.
Hellooo, how weird is that?

02:51.437 --> 02:53.554
and them?
They're our neighbors.

02:53.856 --> 02:56.690
And their houses.
And their gardens.

02:57.443 --> 03:01.062
And their lives, which Glass wants
to know nothing about

03:14.460 --> 03:14.995
Tereza?

03:16.170 --> 03:17.035
Hey Phil

03:18.547 --> 03:22.040
Glass wanted to come and pick you up but
then decided she wanted to cook for you

03:22.551 --> 03:23.962
instead and now she's like...

03:25.012 --> 03:26.298
you know what she's like
come on, let's go

03:29.475 --> 03:32.013
Come on, don't make a big deal about it.
How was camp?

03:32.311 --> 03:34.724
Think of it like...
You have a cat allergy

03:35.064 --> 03:36.396
and they send you to play
with a bunch of cats.

03:36.690 --> 03:37.521
That's kinda like how it is

03:37.816 --> 03:38.647
with me and French.

03:38.984 --> 03:39.770
You're such a drama queen.

03:40.110 --> 03:44.400
A drama queen, bien sûr.
How are my two ladies, by the way?

03:44.698 --> 03:48.191
Every time I called Glass was... I dunno...

03:49.119 --> 03:49.734
Phil?

03:51.663 --> 03:53.245
What happened here?

03:53.582 --> 03:56.416
You didn't hear?
It was a real shit storm, like no other.

03:56.710 --> 03:58.827
I've never seen anything like it before.

04:00.214 --> 04:01.170
Damn.

04:30.452 --> 04:34.287
Thanks again
Say hi to Pascal for me

04:34.581 --> 04:34.946
bye

04:57.229 --> 05:01.599
Sorry I didn't pick you up.
It was just... Are you hungry?

05:06.822 --> 05:12.819
I actually wanted to make chicken, but then
I ran out of time and then I...

05:13.162 --> 05:17.122
Mum, I really wasn't expecting that you
learned how to cook in 3 weeks

05:17.416 --> 05:22.502
Watch your tongue, young man.
Ah, no no... Just two.

05:23.755 --> 05:24.586
Dianne isn't here?

05:25.507 --> 05:29.877
No, she is...
Come on, tell me about your thing...

05:30.179 --> 05:31.511
About your camp...

05:31.805 --> 05:38.268
Mum, it was amazing, please send
me again next year

05:39.605 --> 05:41.312
That nice, huh?

05:47.988 --> 05:50.651
HEY, there you are!

05:51.658 --> 05:56.369
Hey Phil, let's talk later, yeah?
I have to run.

05:56.872 --> 05:58.329
Welcome home.

06:02.586 --> 06:04.043
What's up with her?

06:06.423 --> 06:09.507
Nothing. Come on, let's eat.

06:36.328 --> 06:37.068
Mom?

06:37.871 --> 06:39.954
Don't mom me, I'm warning you.

06:41.250 --> 06:42.661
What happened here?
Did the Third World War pass

06:43.001 --> 06:43.912
through our garden?

06:44.544 --> 06:47.503
That was the storm, it wrecked everything.

07:15.367 --> 07:19.737
What happened to Dianne's tree? Glass?

07:26.169 --> 07:27.125
Mom?

07:37.180 --> 07:38.261
Glass?

07:44.062 --> 07:45.018
Mom!?

07:45.355 --> 07:48.314
Not now Phil. Later, darling, yeah?

07:58.368 --> 07:59.358
Welcome home.

08:01.330 --> 08:05.745
When Glass first arrived, she was barely 17,
I think, and already 9 months pregnant.

08:06.084 --> 08:08.246
And all of a sudden, there were three.

08:09.588 --> 08:13.081
Three kids in the middle of nowhere.
It didn't go down so well around here.

08:13.383 --> 08:16.046
A woman with two kids and
no husband, it didn't look good.

08:16.345 --> 08:19.213
But we got along really well, even
without a man in the house.

08:19.514 --> 08:21.631
Other kids would often ask
where our father was.

08:21.975 --> 08:24.638
And we'd ask Glass.
She's always say something like:

08:24.978 --> 08:27.095
He's a seafaring adventurer

08:27.397 --> 08:28.012
Or something like:

08:28.315 --> 08:30.557
A cowboy on the ranch

08:30.859 --> 08:32.725
And later, when fairytales just
didn't cut it anymore.

08:33.070 --> 08:36.563
I'll tell you when you're older, okay?

08:36.865 --> 08:40.654
At some point, we stopped asking,
because it was useless.

08:40.994 --> 08:45.159
And now it's almost normal to know
nothing about our father.

08:45.457 --> 08:51.078
The ominous number three on the list.
Dianne doesn't even seem to care anymore.

08:51.380 --> 08:56.671
From my point of view, there's an emptiness,
almost like a blind spot.

09:00.764 --> 09:03.051
Hey, do you ever think about him?

09:03.433 --> 09:04.298
About who?

09:05.394 --> 09:07.602
You know who I'm talking about.
Don't you miss him?

09:09.231 --> 09:13.726
Why should I? I don't know him.

09:16.238 --> 09:20.528
Don't you ever wish... I mean...
Don't you ever think about how it would

09:20.826 --> 09:22.033
be if we knew him?

09:28.291 --> 09:28.781
Come on, let's go

10:06.204 --> 10:07.320
Get it?

10:07.622 --> 10:12.162
Yeah. What about it?

10:12.461 --> 10:17.581
Duh! these are the names of her lovers.
So look at the dates, and

10:17.883 --> 10:19.920
count back nine months.

10:22.387 --> 10:25.346
That must be him. It makes total sense.

10:38.904 --> 10:43.069
America. Somehow this word has
always had a calming effect on me.

10:45.452 --> 10:48.195
As if it could fill this emptiness in me.

10:59.758 --> 11:03.172
You're back and you haven't
called me yet? You Lulu!

11:04.804 --> 11:10.095
This Lulu just got back from language camp.
I can't wait to see you though, Madame.

11:10.393 --> 11:11.349
Hehe

11:21.029 --> 11:25.820
Don't hehe me, mister.
I'm dying of boredom and I want to see you.

11:26.159 --> 11:27.195
NOW.

11:54.479 --> 11:59.224
Really Phil, I'm so glad you're back.
These past three weeks have been horrible.

11:59.526 --> 12:02.564
Ok, hold on, you'll love this.
What do you think?

12:04.739 --> 12:05.479
Nice

12:06.408 --> 12:09.196
Kay, you're right.
It doesn't do my ass justice and my boobs

12:09.494 --> 12:12.202
look like two peas.
What's crazy was that storm, you know?

12:12.497 --> 12:14.534
Right before we went
on vacation, it was huge.

12:14.833 --> 12:18.747
It felt like the apocalypse was coming.
They say there was a kid riding a bike who

12:19.087 --> 12:21.579
almost died after a branch
hit him or something.

12:22.799 --> 12:24.540
Shit, and?

12:24.843 --> 12:28.211
Monsieur? What do you think?

12:28.597 --> 12:32.557
I'd say... A little less done
up would also be okay.

12:33.810 --> 12:37.099
The wrapping shouldn't look
better than the present

12:38.857 --> 12:41.895
Kat loves to be different. Actually,
she'd like to be a little like my mum.

12:42.193 --> 12:44.185
She idolizes Glass as
if she were a goddess,

12:44.487 --> 12:47.355
and adores everything in her that all
others find disturbing

12:47.657 --> 12:50.741
Hey, have you spoken with Dianne lately?

12:51.077 --> 13:01.076
Nope and focus please, you're mine now!
Oh my God, I'm so happy you're back!

13:24.444 --> 13:27.232
Mum! Please.

13:27.530 --> 13:32.946
You're finally free when you
have nothing to lose.

13:38.166 --> 13:39.953
THERE'S NO "S" IN BITCH!

13:41.127 --> 13:45.337
Glass always did what she wanted. She
didn't care what others thought about her.

13:45.632 --> 13:47.919
But the others didn't exactly like that.

13:48.259 --> 13:51.627
They found it predictable.
Glass called it being organized.

13:54.432 --> 14:04.431
The three of us - we stick together.
We're strong and we will fight back.

14:04.776 --> 14:08.190
We don't have to fit in anywhere.

14:12.784 --> 14:14.992
And always remember that.

14:16.871 --> 14:26.870
No one can tell us how
we should live, no one.

14:27.173 --> 14:30.757
I think Dianne suffered from Glass' social
ignorance more than I did.

14:31.094 --> 14:33.211
But back then, she was still hopeful.

14:38.435 --> 14:39.050
Oh.

14:42.313 --> 14:45.181
Hey. Come on.

14:45.483 --> 14:46.974
Hey there, I'm Kyle.

14:56.119 --> 14:58.406
Will you stay with us forever?

15:03.752 --> 15:04.913
Parfait?

15:05.211 --> 15:06.702
Bien sûr, madame.
I'm dying for it.

15:07.046 --> 15:08.162
Lemon or strawberry?

15:08.465 --> 15:10.422
Love fruit.

15:11.718 --> 15:13.334
Madame, I like you.

15:13.636 --> 15:16.219
Look at me.
Quickly, look.

15:16.514 --> 15:21.885
You're finally getting a beard.
I love it Monsieur.

15:22.187 --> 15:23.223
Gorgeous!

15:23.521 --> 15:27.686
It's a masterpiece, isn't it?
That tickles.

15:28.026 --> 15:33.567
That really tickles.
Your hair looks like cotton candy.

15:33.865 --> 15:39.236
Look at you!
You're the one with the thick beard!

15:39.537 --> 15:44.202
Un, deux, trois.
Okay, you have to make the cream.

15:44.501 --> 15:50.042
Wait. By the way, we're getting a
new guy in our class.

15:50.340 --> 15:51.126
And?

15:51.424 --> 15:54.667
And nothing, just that. I flipped
through my dad's documents and saw.

15:55.053 --> 15:57.420
It seems they used to live in the area and

15:57.722 --> 16:01.341
then moved out of the country for a while.
Now they're back and he's

16:01.643 --> 16:02.975
supposed to be cute.

16:07.982 --> 16:09.894
You can't manipulate my thoughts.

16:13.613 --> 16:15.730
Okay, fine, you totally can.

16:16.074 --> 16:18.691
Maybe.
Picture, now!

16:19.035 --> 16:20.526
Yeah, okay!

16:51.150 --> 16:56.111
Dianne? Dianne, do you want to chat?

17:46.247 --> 17:47.988
Morning.

17:49.042 --> 17:49.577
Hey Phil.

17:49.876 --> 17:50.741
Morning.

17:51.085 --> 17:52.246
Good morning.

17:54.380 --> 17:55.666
Hey, Dianne, where were you?

17:56.716 --> 17:57.297
What?

17:58.384 --> 17:59.465
Last night, where were you?

18:00.803 --> 18:02.465
I have no idea what you're talking about.

18:05.266 --> 18:08.054
Do you maybe wanna go to school together?

18:11.064 --> 18:12.521
I have to take care of something first

18:20.448 --> 18:24.613
My boobs grew like crazy over the summer!
Feel 'em. 2 cup sizes or something!

18:24.911 --> 18:26.277
At least!

18:27.789 --> 18:31.703
Are you sure that neither one of you guys
wasn't switched at birth?

18:32.043 --> 18:34.706
I mean, like honestly, what
makes you two twins?

18:35.004 --> 18:36.211
Do you want my gum?

18:36.506 --> 18:37.087
No thanks.

18:37.382 --> 18:38.213
I can share.

18:39.300 --> 18:42.043
So ladies and gentlemen, say goodbye to the
sweetness of wasting time.

18:42.387 --> 18:44.128
Katja?
May I have your attention, please?

18:46.891 --> 18:47.597
My god.

18:47.892 --> 18:49.303
May I have your attention, please?

19:20.633 --> 19:22.169
And!? What did I tell you?

19:22.802 --> 19:25.590
Hi, I'm Nicholas.

19:26.514 --> 19:28.255
Finally, I know your name.

19:44.115 --> 19:48.075
Phil?
I'm going to have another baby.

19:51.372 --> 19:59.041
Do you want to feel it? It's going
to take a while, it's still so small!

20:01.591 --> 20:03.503
Isn't that nice?

20:03.885 --> 20:08.550
It is, it is. Have you told Dianne yet?

20:08.848 --> 20:11.181
Yeah, this morning.

20:11.476 --> 20:13.183
And what did she say?

20:25.406 --> 20:27.773
I don't want to see tears when you drop it.

20:52.475 --> 20:53.636
Earth to Phil!

20:58.481 --> 21:00.268
I finally know your name

21:05.196 --> 21:06.983
Why did you wink at that guy?

21:07.698 --> 21:12.238
Cuz I saw you like him.
Want a lemonade, darling?

21:12.703 --> 21:13.489
Yeah.

21:16.207 --> 21:17.323
Where's my globe?

21:17.625 --> 21:18.411
Which globe?

21:19.252 --> 21:20.788
My snow globe!

21:27.093 --> 21:29.585
I told you already, I left it in the car.

21:35.268 --> 21:37.180
Here, take it.

22:26.319 --> 22:29.938
Dianne, I have to tell you something.
Dianne?

22:58.809 --> 23:00.892
Ew. You're really gross sometimes

23:01.646 --> 23:02.386
How so?

23:04.106 --> 23:06.723
Hey, I have something for you. Pick a hand.

23:07.068 --> 23:07.524
Right.

23:08.736 --> 23:11.149
Tadaa! Your own bow

23:11.447 --> 23:11.937
Is it for me?

23:12.240 --> 23:15.028
Yes, here.
Now you can really go hunting.

23:15.368 --> 23:18.577
Have you heard of Diana, the Roman goddess?

23:18.871 --> 23:19.236
No

23:19.538 --> 23:22.372
She's the goddess of hunting.
I'll make you an arrow and show

23:22.667 --> 23:23.578
you how to shoot it

23:43.062 --> 23:45.224
I just want to be alone, okay?

23:45.523 --> 23:46.229
It's the phone. Again... Phil?

23:48.567 --> 23:49.728
Leave me alone!

23:50.069 --> 23:51.059
Did I do something wrong?
We can talk about it

23:56.867 --> 23:58.608
I could get rid of you, Kyle.
I really could.

24:01.539 --> 24:01.949
No

24:02.248 --> 24:02.487
Yes, I could

24:02.790 --> 24:03.325
Yeah? Fuck it

24:03.624 --> 24:05.331
Yeah, well then, fuck it

24:05.626 --> 24:09.495
I'll always always always be by your side.
I promise.

24:13.801 --> 24:17.340
Kyle, get out...

24:18.973 --> 24:19.929
Get out!

24:24.854 --> 24:25.389
Good morning.

24:33.612 --> 24:35.069
Where's Kyle?

24:35.364 --> 24:40.359
Kyle won't be coming by anymore.
He sends you his regards, but he's

24:40.661 --> 24:42.152
not the one for me.

26:09.917 --> 26:11.499
I don't get what you have against him.

26:12.628 --> 26:14.369
Just because.
He's a fake.

26:14.672 --> 26:18.086
I feel it.
And you know I have a good instinct,

26:18.426 --> 26:20.338
when it comes to people.

26:22.179 --> 26:23.386
Why are you being so grumpy today?

26:23.973 --> 26:25.180
I'm not!

26:26.267 --> 26:27.508
I must be imagining things then.

26:29.103 --> 26:31.811
I got a bad review on eBay, okay?

26:32.148 --> 26:34.356
Ahaa, there's the culprit.

26:34.650 --> 26:40.237
Who does he think he is?
Horny asshole.

26:42.158 --> 26:44.901
Besides, he collects stuff.

26:45.202 --> 26:46.192
Who, your eBay customer?

26:46.495 --> 26:52.583
No, Nicholas. Listen to me, Phil,
something's not right with this guy.

26:54.378 --> 26:56.870
Come on, let's go.

27:02.595 --> 27:03.927
My God.

27:08.517 --> 27:10.133
Horny asshole. Besides, he collects stuff.

27:11.228 --> 27:11.968
Who, your eBay customer?

27:12.271 --> 27:14.103
No, Nicholas.
Listen to me, Phil, something's...

27:45.429 --> 27:51.391
Look at this carefully, ladies and
gentlemen, and tell me... What do you see?

27:51.685 --> 27:58.307
When you don't understand something, it
sometimes helps if you step back, to get the

27:58.609 --> 28:00.896
bigger picture.
Yes, Katja?

28:01.362 --> 28:03.103
Did you have breakfast with a
philosopher this morning?

28:04.532 --> 28:07.366
Thank you for your meaningful
contribution, Katja.

28:07.660 --> 28:09.743
What do you see now?

28:13.624 --> 28:16.458
Distance provides clarity.

28:16.752 --> 28:20.962
When you distance yourselves
you get a better understanding.

28:22.591 --> 28:24.753
Only then can you see everything clearly.

28:35.312 --> 28:35.893
Hey Phil.

28:36.730 --> 28:37.686
Hi.

28:38.983 --> 28:40.019
Where were you today?

28:42.111 --> 28:43.101
Where.. Where was I?

28:44.071 --> 28:46.358
Yeah, during training?
At the track?

28:46.657 --> 28:47.943
You weren't there.

28:48.826 --> 28:53.946
Right. Yeah I was just hanging around there.

28:54.456 --> 28:59.372
Ah, well then.

29:02.965 --> 29:04.001
That kinda sucks.

29:06.051 --> 29:08.043
I missed seeing you there.

29:09.430 --> 29:10.136
Me?

29:25.070 --> 29:27.528
Yeah, I missed you.

29:29.450 --> 29:30.281
And tomorrow?

29:31.744 --> 29:32.780
Tomorrow?

29:33.454 --> 29:36.913
Well, yeah. If you...
if you want to hang around there

29:37.207 --> 29:40.791
tomorrow, then just wait for me
until I finish my laps.

29:43.380 --> 29:45.337
Um... Okay. Okay.

30:17.164 --> 30:19.406
Kat, come quick!
I have to tell you something.

30:21.377 --> 30:24.745
Hey, Thomas just accused me of
having an affair with you.

30:25.381 --> 30:27.213
With you!
How ridiculous is that?

30:27.508 --> 30:30.626
And even if it were true,
it's none of his business!

30:30.928 --> 30:34.012
I'm really so over it.
Men are just so stupid

30:34.515 --> 30:35.722
Hello?

30:36.600 --> 30:44.224
Present company excluded!
At least I'm sure that you'll be mine

30:44.525 --> 30:46.642
forever and ever.

30:49.321 --> 30:51.233
What did you want to tell me, darling?

30:54.660 --> 30:56.367
I forgot.

30:57.454 --> 30:58.194
Okay.

31:08.632 --> 31:09.418
Mom?

31:12.803 --> 31:13.213
Phil.

31:13.512 --> 31:14.252
Is everything okay?

31:15.764 --> 31:18.302
Yes, do you need something?

31:20.060 --> 31:26.102
It's just that, I think I have a date
tomorrow and I can't fall asleep.

31:26.525 --> 31:28.141
Okay, come here, sit down.

31:35.576 --> 31:36.942
Are you sure everything's okay?

31:38.162 --> 31:42.577
I'm going to give you some advice, yeah?
So that you can let me sleep in peace.

31:43.041 --> 31:46.660
Okay. What should I do?

31:49.506 --> 31:53.921
Do everything.
But never ask him if he loves you.

31:55.053 --> 31:57.386
Why not?

32:00.017 --> 32:03.101
If he says no, then you'll wish you'd never
asked.

32:04.396 --> 32:08.891
And if he says yes, you'll never know if
it's just because you asked, and he wants to

32:09.193 --> 32:12.857
avoid an awkward scene.
You'll be disappointed either way,

32:13.155 --> 32:14.020
so drop it.

32:14.531 --> 32:17.444
But he could also say yes and
mean it, couldn't he?

32:18.744 --> 32:20.736
Just trust me on this one Phil, I've
been through this before.

32:21.079 --> 32:24.538
Funny, mom. You're such a big help.

32:26.168 --> 32:29.252
If you have any more questions,
then ask away.

32:29.546 --> 32:32.710
But not tonight, okay?
Night night, darling.

32:41.016 --> 32:41.802
Goodnight, mom.

32:43.101 --> 32:47.812
It wasn't that easy for Glass either.
I think she fought hard for a long time.

32:48.148 --> 32:50.356
And then she got tired of fighting.

32:50.692 --> 32:54.060
It was around the time when she
went to the hospital.

33:02.830 --> 33:05.664
Mum? Glass.
Mum. Mama.

33:05.999 --> 33:11.415
Quick, call an ambulance,
please! Do it.

33:11.672 --> 33:12.753
DO IT!

33:17.845 --> 33:19.677
Phil? What happened?

33:20.013 --> 33:21.754
I called an ambulance.
They're on their way.

33:22.349 --> 33:24.807
Good job, my darling.
Where's your sister?

33:25.143 --> 33:26.679
Upstairs in Glass' room.
She's cleaning up.

33:27.729 --> 33:28.469
Dianne?

33:36.989 --> 33:38.025
What's going on in there?

33:39.032 --> 33:40.364
Nor for children's eyes.

33:43.203 --> 33:47.789
It was a terrible sight to behold and Glass
was sad for a very long time.

33:48.375 --> 33:55.339
And Dianne started to withdraw herself too.
I wanted to be sad as well, but it somehow

33:55.632 --> 33:59.046
didn't seem to work. I didn't have
any connection to the baby yet.

34:02.472 --> 34:06.341
I think that was the moment where
things started to go downhill.

34:06.643 --> 34:10.306
And a small silver rift started
nestling itself between us.

34:18.614 --> 34:24.485
Hey, can't you sleep? Come here.

34:28.165 --> 34:33.377
When you were a baby, I always
touched your nose like this.

34:33.670 --> 34:35.911
It would make you so sleepy.

34:36.214 --> 34:39.924
Someone once told me that
life is like a big house.

34:40.510 --> 34:42.797
With many many rooms.

34:43.179 --> 34:50.474
You don't want to live in every room, and
that's why some doors are always closed.

34:50.771 --> 34:55.106
And sometimes, things happen in life that
can't be immediately understood.

34:55.400 --> 35:02.148
They're just too big and powerful, and you

35:02.449 --> 35:07.240
feel too small to face them.
And then you get anxious.

35:07.537 --> 35:14.751
Do you know what you have to do then?
You have to stick that anxiety into one of

35:15.045 --> 35:20.632
those empty rooms.
But it's very important that you never throw

35:20.926 --> 35:27.514
the keys to that door away.
Do you understand what I'm saying?

35:37.901 --> 35:39.517
Come.

35:43.573 --> 35:44.689
Last one there's a rotten egg!

35:51.081 --> 35:52.788
So? What now? Should we go to the lake?

35:53.500 --> 35:58.211
I don't have my trunks with me and I still
have to help Glass with a few things

35:59.047 --> 36:01.460
Can't help those who don't wanna be helped.

36:02.884 --> 36:04.796
Kiss Glass for me, yeah?

36:25.866 --> 36:28.609
Hey, cool that you waited.

37:08.992 --> 37:10.028
Are you coming?

39:11.448 --> 39:14.236
I'm so happy for you!

39:15.202 --> 39:17.489
In love, huh. Would you hate
me if I asked, whether you

39:17.787 --> 39:21.246
can really talk about love, when you've
only done it for the first time?

39:21.541 --> 39:22.406
Pascal.

39:22.792 --> 39:24.454
What good does it do him if
everyone sugarcoats it?

39:25.045 --> 39:26.911
I've known him for weeks!

39:27.214 --> 39:29.171
Yeah, from looking at him, as far as I
understand.

39:29.466 --> 39:30.582
That is, more from gazing.

39:30.884 --> 39:33.501
Exactly. And sometimes
a look is all it takes,

39:33.803 --> 39:34.759
isn't it Pacal?

39:35.138 --> 39:36.595
Of course, you're right.

39:37.349 --> 39:41.719
And what did he say...
You know... After?

39:43.521 --> 39:45.353
He didn't say anything. We got dressed

39:45.649 --> 39:47.390
Well then, there's nothing
I can say, really.

39:47.817 --> 39:50.184
No 'see you tomorrow' or 'I'll call you'
or something?

39:50.654 --> 39:53.362
Yeah, obviously that.
He wants to get together, he just

39:53.657 --> 39:54.898
doesn't know where yet.

39:55.533 --> 39:58.071
Why don't you just hang in Visible?
You and your lover?

39:58.370 --> 40:00.703
Because I don't want Dianne and
Glass to find out just yet

40:01.039 --> 40:02.951
About your fling? Is it a secret?

40:03.250 --> 40:04.991
No, I don't want them to know we had sex,
if you really wanna know.

40:05.585 --> 40:07.201
So you're that loud, huh.

40:09.381 --> 40:13.045
Ah, but you can use my shed, I'll give you
the keys in case you want

40:13.385 --> 40:14.421
another wild night.

40:16.221 --> 40:16.551
Yes!

40:21.268 --> 40:24.978
Phil? Could you be
home early tonight?

40:25.272 --> 40:26.388
I'm cooking.

40:26.690 --> 40:27.806
Hallelujah, what are you planning?

40:28.692 --> 40:31.560
What should I have planned?
We're having someone over

40:31.861 --> 40:33.227
and I'm going to cook, that's all.

40:33.613 --> 40:34.273
And who's the victim?

40:35.782 --> 40:36.613
Hey!

40:37.784 --> 40:40.492
You don't know him.
His name's Mike and he's a carpenter,

40:40.829 --> 40:41.615
and I'd like to...

40:41.913 --> 40:45.031
I see, a carpenter. What needs fixing?

40:45.333 --> 40:48.542
Shut up! We've only met a few times...

40:48.837 --> 40:51.705
...And now you're cooking for him?
Are you freaking out?

40:53.008 --> 40:55.295
Don't be ridiculous. I just want...

40:55.593 --> 41:01.055
You'd like for everything to be perfect?
But Glass, Michael's going to get

41:01.391 --> 41:03.007
the wrong impression.

41:04.686 --> 41:07.053
Bye bye, Phil.
Get out of here!

41:07.355 --> 41:08.687
Get out of here.

41:32.547 --> 41:33.537
Wait here.

41:46.644 --> 41:47.805
Tadaaa!

41:56.571 --> 41:59.029
Tell me something.

42:03.078 --> 42:04.489
What do you want to hear?

42:05.121 --> 42:08.910
I dunno.
Something about yourself.

42:11.211 --> 42:14.329
I want to know everything.

42:19.511 --> 42:29.510
Okay, well, I like...
Sleeping in, chilling, eating.

42:31.606 --> 42:39.025
I like running and spaghetti.
Yeah...

42:42.033 --> 42:48.280
I don't know if it was a dream, but I think
we've met before, a few years ago.

42:48.832 --> 42:49.822
Could it be?

42:52.168 --> 42:55.707
I was walking with my
mother to the supermarket.

42:56.172 --> 42:59.165
I saw you standing
in front of the door.

42:59.467 --> 43:02.460
I was carrying a few bottles and
they fell out of my hands.

43:06.141 --> 43:07.757
Do you remember?

43:17.444 --> 43:21.063
No, I can't remember anything right now.

43:33.293 --> 43:37.128
Where were you? I asked you to be on time.

43:37.380 --> 43:40.123
Sorry! I was...

43:41.426 --> 43:42.507
Is he already here?

43:42.802 --> 43:44.168
Yes!

43:47.432 --> 43:51.517
Michael? My son. Son - Michael

43:52.103 --> 43:54.345
Hi, it's nice to finally meet you.
I've already heard quite a few

43:54.647 --> 43:55.262
things about you.

43:56.232 --> 43:59.066
Hi! I'm Phil, nice to meet you too.

43:59.360 --> 44:04.480
The fish totally fell apart,
so I made fish soup instead.

44:05.617 --> 44:08.360
It's definitely disgusting.

44:11.206 --> 44:16.418
Ok, who's gonna try it?

44:45.782 --> 44:48.149
You're right, Glass, it's really no good.

44:51.496 --> 44:56.207
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry!
Do you want bread?

44:57.460 --> 45:01.875
No no!
Should we make a couple of pizzas instead?

45:02.173 --> 45:02.538
Yes!

45:02.840 --> 45:04.797
Yes yes!

45:29.367 --> 45:34.158
How was your date? Is he your boyfriend now?

45:34.747 --> 45:35.157
What?

45:35.456 --> 45:38.665
Glass told me, that you wanted
to go meet a guy.

45:39.043 --> 45:41.251
I hope it doesn't bother you.

45:42.213 --> 45:42.953
What?
That I'm gay?

45:43.256 --> 45:45.589
Or that Glass can't keep her mouth shut?

45:46.175 --> 45:48.258
I'm hoping for both.

45:53.349 --> 45:55.261
Nah, don't worry about it.

45:58.021 --> 46:04.313
And yeah, I might have a boyfriend.
I... What exactly did Glass tell you?

46:05.612 --> 46:07.899
That she doesn't really know.

46:10.908 --> 46:14.743
Sorry, I didn't want to be indiscreet.

46:15.246 --> 46:22.369
Ah. No no, it's all good... It's just
that I don't even know yet.

46:22.670 --> 46:24.332
Unfortunately.

46:35.391 --> 46:37.223
He shouldn't get his hopes up.

46:38.227 --> 46:38.717
What?

46:40.146 --> 46:43.765
He shouldn't bother so much.
He'll get kicked out sooner or later.

46:46.653 --> 46:48.565
It's actually going quite well.

46:49.489 --> 46:53.233
Well yeah, it always starts out well.
It's far too late for such things.

46:58.331 --> 47:02.371
Could be.
Anyway, I'd still give it a go.

47:03.461 --> 47:05.168
Just give him a chance.

47:06.047 --> 47:10.337
Nothing is going to change.
It's too late.

47:10.885 --> 47:12.797
Don't you get it?

47:38.413 --> 47:41.997
And? Questions?

48:00.351 --> 48:02.343
What are you doing?

48:05.022 --> 48:07.981
Did you manage to get anything out of her?

48:08.276 --> 48:12.020
Nope. And I really don't care either way.

48:13.740 --> 48:17.575
Hey, Phil. If it bothers you
so much, then do something.

48:17.869 --> 48:19.610
Just ask her.

48:27.503 --> 48:33.340
Okay, then I can have it back, yeah?

48:39.098 --> 48:40.214
Glass?

48:40.516 --> 48:41.256
Yeah?

48:42.810 --> 48:44.642
Where is the center exactly?

48:46.314 --> 48:47.771
What do you mean?

48:48.107 --> 48:50.190
Like, the center.
The center of the world.

48:50.485 --> 48:51.191
Where is it?

48:51.486 --> 48:58.199
You really know how to ask questions.
The center of the world hmm.

49:00.119 --> 49:03.032
I think... I think it's
different for everyone.

49:04.916 --> 49:09.627
It's where someone stands and what
the important things are.

49:11.214 --> 49:12.330
Yeah?

49:18.387 --> 49:19.673
Can I meet your mother?

49:21.098 --> 49:22.509
Trust me, you don't want to do that.

49:22.809 --> 49:25.552
Why not? I hear she's pretty cool.

49:25.978 --> 49:27.264
Oh yeah? What've you heard?

49:28.731 --> 49:31.144
Nothing bad.
Just that she's freer than most of the

49:31.442 --> 49:32.649
philistines around here.

49:33.444 --> 49:34.980
Have you told her about us?

49:35.279 --> 49:35.564
Yeah.

49:36.280 --> 49:41.241
Really? And.. Is she okay with it?

49:41.536 --> 49:42.322
Mhmm.

49:44.247 --> 49:47.206
Have you... Does anyone
else know? About us?

49:48.084 --> 49:49.040
No one.

49:49.794 --> 49:50.659
And your friend?

49:52.046 --> 49:53.503
Kat? No.

49:54.215 --> 49:56.423
She'd be jealous, wouldn't she?

49:56.759 --> 49:58.796
Could be, why? Does it seem like it?

50:00.263 --> 50:02.129
I don't think she really likes me.

50:03.224 --> 50:04.715
Yeah, right.

50:11.899 --> 50:12.764
What was that?

50:13.109 --> 50:13.815
What?

50:14.235 --> 50:15.351
That...

50:18.698 --> 50:20.109
Could I meet her?

50:20.408 --> 50:21.364
Who?

50:22.660 --> 50:25.027
Your mum?

50:25.371 --> 50:27.454
I dunno.

50:28.624 --> 50:29.705
Hmmm.

50:36.424 --> 50:41.636
Well, you get your taste from me,
for sure. Have fun boys.

50:41.971 --> 50:43.587
And not too wild.

50:48.144 --> 50:49.931
May I introduce you? My mother.

50:57.737 --> 51:00.400
You never told me you live in
a fairytale castle.

51:14.170 --> 51:22.044
Careful, it's um... I mean, when you look
at the studies, I'm a total cliché.

51:22.345 --> 51:25.634
No father figure.
Surrounded by dominant women.

51:25.973 --> 51:27.930
Are you in touch with your father?

51:28.601 --> 51:29.432
But it's all fine.

51:29.727 --> 51:33.346
I guess you could say that.
After all, I'm not the first one who grew up

51:33.648 --> 51:36.106
without knowing his Father.
There were for example: Romulus and Remus,

51:36.400 --> 51:39.234
raised by a wolf, and founders of Rome,
if we go by the myth.

51:39.528 --> 51:43.192
Father? None! Or DaVinci,
or Charlie Chaplin, Louis Armstrong,

51:43.491 --> 51:46.780
John Lennon, Mike Tyson, Truman
Capote, Jack Nicholson, Gene Simmons,

51:47.119 --> 51:50.362
Eminem, Bill Clinton, Obama and not to
forget Luke Skywalker.

51:50.665 --> 51:54.705
All of them grew up without a dad.
And regardless, they became something.

51:55.044 --> 51:57.331
Well, maybe I shouldn't
think about it too much.

51:57.630 --> 52:01.340
Why does this damn blind spot make me so
insecure? How can you miss someone,

52:01.676 --> 52:03.417
whom you don't even know?

52:03.886 --> 52:05.923
Can I come and visit your place next?

52:07.348 --> 52:08.338
That'll be difficult.

52:09.016 --> 52:10.052
Difficult? Why?

52:13.521 --> 52:19.734
Because my dad is always traveling,
and my mom drinks Prosecco

52:20.069 --> 52:21.685
like her life depends on
it with her friends.

52:23.197 --> 52:24.733
So.. Difficult.

52:34.875 --> 52:36.161
Is it bad?

52:36.877 --> 52:40.041
Not really. It was just... Just...

52:44.844 --> 52:46.130
Watch out, watch out.

53:02.069 --> 53:02.650
Come on, lift it!

53:09.577 --> 53:13.036
That didn't work out.

53:14.915 --> 53:16.201
Does she ever talk to you about it?

53:16.500 --> 53:16.830
About what?

53:17.251 --> 53:19.243
Glass. Does she talk to you about Dianne?

53:21.797 --> 53:24.039
No. Honestly, I don't
even want to ask.

53:24.341 --> 53:27.379
I feel like they have to
work it out themselves.

53:27.678 --> 53:28.885
And you?

53:29.972 --> 53:32.089
What are you doing about it?

53:59.293 --> 54:01.125
Sorry, I'm almost done.

54:06.258 --> 54:06.964
Are you leaving?

54:07.259 --> 54:08.670
I'm meeting Kora for a bit

54:22.441 --> 54:26.481
I'll always always always be by your side.

54:28.906 --> 54:31.114
You should put make-up on more often.

54:31.408 --> 54:35.448
Ass. What's Kat saying now that
you have a boyfriend?

54:35.746 --> 54:37.237
Did she tell you about it?

54:38.290 --> 54:41.454
No, she didn't, but I can tell.
Have you forgotten?

54:41.752 --> 54:43.709
I am your sister, after all.

54:47.508 --> 54:49.090
Or doesn't she know yet?

54:49.385 --> 54:50.921
Yeah, I know. I have to tell her.

54:56.058 --> 55:01.804
Hey Dianne, I miss talking to you.

55:17.079 --> 55:19.116
Hey Phil, Vanilla ice cream!

55:19.456 --> 55:20.617
No I can't anymore!

55:20.916 --> 55:24.205
Yes you can! Vanilla is good for the soul.

55:24.712 --> 55:25.623
Says who?

55:26.297 --> 55:26.878
Says me!

55:27.506 --> 55:28.622
But I don't feel so good.

55:28.966 --> 55:33.301
Then you have to push through. Here, eat it.

55:34.096 --> 55:35.428
Mmmm.

55:38.225 --> 55:40.888
Hey, it's slowly becoming
pathological, Monsieur.

55:41.645 --> 55:43.352
You need immediate attention.

55:46.358 --> 55:48.020
Do you really hate him that much?

55:48.319 --> 55:51.938
Well, hate... I just think it's ridiculous
how everyone's making such a

55:52.239 --> 55:53.525
big fuss about him.

55:55.242 --> 55:56.904
You don't find him shitty though, do you?

55:57.912 --> 56:00.245
No no, I just think, that he...

56:00.623 --> 56:01.909
Kat, we're together.

56:05.252 --> 56:06.584
You're kidding, right?

56:08.589 --> 56:11.798
No, really, I shit you not.

56:14.595 --> 56:15.506
Since when?

56:17.223 --> 56:19.556
I dunno.
Not that long.

56:23.437 --> 56:26.726
I wanted to tell you, but I
didn't know how to...

56:35.115 --> 56:42.454
I'm sorry, Madame. Really.

56:44.917 --> 56:47.034
Okay, wow. How's he in bed?

56:47.336 --> 56:49.794
Can't you ever ask normal questions?

56:50.130 --> 56:51.917
Who came on to who? Did you come
on to him or did he come on to you?

56:52.216 --> 56:52.956
Do you want to get married?

56:53.259 --> 56:54.090
Do you want to have kids?

56:55.386 --> 57:01.053
Please do me a favor. Try to like him, okay?

57:03.102 --> 57:07.517
I'll keep my absolute, most
beautiful smile just for him.

58:03.579 --> 58:06.196
Because whenever you want,
you can borrow my dad.

58:06.665 --> 58:08.031
He loves to annoy kids.

58:08.334 --> 58:09.290
Very funny.

58:15.090 --> 58:15.671
Hi.

58:16.383 --> 58:16.748
Hey.

58:17.092 --> 58:21.211
I know everything about you two.
Every dirty detail.

58:22.598 --> 58:23.088
Meaning?

58:24.808 --> 58:25.468
Hush money.

58:27.728 --> 58:28.718
How much?

58:29.146 --> 58:31.058
Two thousand.

58:33.150 --> 58:34.561
In small, used bills?

58:34.860 --> 58:42.233
In large, new... Ice cream cones.
Cherry and vanilla.

58:42.534 --> 58:43.365
Deal.

59:51.353 --> 59:55.017
It was one of those hot, sky blue days,
that tasted like vanilla ice cream

59:55.357 --> 59:57.349
and the future. One of those
days that for whichever reason

59:57.651 --> 01:00:00.644
made your heart beat faster, and on which
you would swear up and down that

01:00:00.946 --> 01:00:02.278
friendships would never end.

01:00:04.032 --> 01:00:06.820
Phil, you have to come quick.
Dianne was arrested!

01:00:13.292 --> 01:00:13.577
Finally, hey Phil.

01:00:13.876 --> 01:00:15.458
What's going on? Where is she?

01:00:15.752 --> 01:00:18.665
I don't exactly know.
They're both in there with the

01:00:19.006 --> 01:00:19.996
police right now.

01:00:21.175 --> 01:00:21.790
Who's 'they'?

01:00:22.134 --> 01:00:23.124
Dianne and Kora

01:00:23.427 --> 01:00:25.544
Kora's also here?

01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:27.045
Michael?

01:00:27.347 --> 01:00:28.178
Hi there.

01:00:29.224 --> 01:00:30.135
Where's Glass?

01:00:31.977 --> 01:00:32.512
She didn't want to come.

01:00:33.687 --> 01:00:38.182
What do you mean, she didn't want to come?
Dianne was arrested and she's not here?

01:00:39.067 --> 01:00:39.602
And? What do we know?

01:00:39.902 --> 01:00:42.394
Nothing really.
The police said something about a dog.

01:00:42.696 --> 01:00:45.484
It might have attacked a boy and
hurt him pretty badly.

01:00:45.908 --> 01:00:46.489
What dog?

01:00:46.783 --> 01:00:48.149
The kid's dog.

01:00:48.869 --> 01:00:50.826
What now, so the kid was
attacked by his own dog.

01:00:51.163 --> 01:00:52.745
What does Dianne have to do with it?

01:00:53.081 --> 01:00:57.371
The boy claims Dianne set the dog on him.
That she was somehow controlling him.

01:00:57.669 --> 01:01:01.003
That's ridiculous. Where are they? There?

01:01:01.298 --> 01:01:01.628
To the right.

01:01:01.965 --> 01:01:03.001
I'll go talk to them.

01:01:07.012 --> 01:01:11.973
Perhaps Michael's reaction would have less
convincing, had he known Dianne longer.

01:01:12.267 --> 01:01:16.932
What Glass had already seen long ago,
I only clearly realized that night.

01:01:17.606 --> 01:01:18.722
Dianne!

01:01:25.989 --> 01:01:27.070
Glass!

01:01:36.542 --> 01:01:40.035
What the hell? What are you doing up there?

01:01:40.337 --> 01:01:41.077
Nothing.

01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:42.871
Dianne.
Stop this shit now!

01:01:43.173 --> 01:01:45.916
Come down here now!
Did you you hear me?

01:01:46.218 --> 01:01:46.924
In a minute!

01:01:47.219 --> 01:01:48.926
No! Now!

01:01:57.271 --> 01:01:57.977
Bye.

01:01:58.272 --> 01:01:58.807
Bye.

01:02:00.566 --> 01:02:02.102
Kora, should I drop you off somewhere?

01:02:02.401 --> 01:02:04.358
That would be great if it's no trouble.

01:02:04.653 --> 01:02:05.643
No, no.

01:02:24.214 --> 01:02:26.581
Did you or didn't you?

01:02:26.883 --> 01:02:27.339
Did I what?

01:02:28.135 --> 01:02:29.626
Set the dog on the boy?

01:02:30.554 --> 01:02:32.420
Dianne? Don't play dumb.

01:02:32.973 --> 01:02:37.593
What are you trying to say, Glass? That
you believe a bunch of strangers over me?

01:02:38.770 --> 01:02:39.760
Because I know you.

01:02:40.897 --> 01:02:43.935
If you knew me then you wouldn't
ask these questions.

01:02:46.236 --> 01:02:49.775
How am I supposed to know you
when you act like this?

01:02:51.575 --> 01:02:54.613
Crazy? What's crazy about
having friends that are

01:02:54.953 --> 01:02:58.993
interested in other things besides
random guys and fucking?

01:03:09.259 --> 01:03:11.091
Where did I go wrong, Dianne?

01:03:12.721 --> 01:03:14.178
You really want me to answer that?

01:03:14.473 --> 01:03:17.090
YES! God damn it! YES!

01:03:18.352 --> 01:03:21.015
How much time have you got?

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:26.265
I give up.

01:03:27.152 --> 01:03:30.896
Mum... Mum, you didn't try hard enough.
Maybe if you...

01:03:31.198 --> 01:03:34.362
Shut up, Phil.
You have no idea.

01:03:34.660 --> 01:03:38.904
No idea.
So stop with the good advice.

01:04:11.238 --> 01:04:14.151
How do you do that?
Make animals come to you?

01:04:16.702 --> 01:04:18.534
I'm not doing anything.

01:04:23.625 --> 01:04:25.912
So why are they coming?

01:04:30.298 --> 01:04:31.789
Because I listen to them.

01:04:48.734 --> 01:04:49.224
What are you up to?

01:04:49.526 --> 01:04:51.358
Phil, don't bother me.

01:04:53.238 --> 01:04:57.073
Did you do it?
Did you set that dog on the kid?

01:04:58.577 --> 01:05:03.072
Phil, don't be such an idiot.
Don't you think I would've held that dog

01:05:03.415 --> 01:05:05.907
back if I could do such shitty magic?

01:05:06.209 --> 01:05:08.952
Then just tell her!
Then everything'll be okay again.

01:05:09.254 --> 01:05:12.918
Phil, it's not okay. Go away, please.

01:05:13.425 --> 01:05:14.916
What's going on with you, Dianne?

01:05:17.512 --> 01:05:20.380
Why can't we go back to the way
things used to be?

01:06:10.315 --> 01:06:15.527
Glass, I don't want to interfere, but maybe
now would be the time to...

01:06:15.821 --> 01:06:17.608
Then don't interfere, Michael.

01:06:20.325 --> 01:06:24.365
This has nothing to do with you,
so stay out of it!

01:06:25.580 --> 01:06:26.696
Glass, this is getting childish!

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:27.905
Ah!

01:06:30.001 --> 01:06:34.086
Then get out! Nobody's forcing you to stay!

01:06:35.048 --> 01:06:37.916
Please leave! Maybe it's better this way.

01:06:50.814 --> 01:06:52.350
With this, you're arming
yourself to the teeth.

01:06:52.649 --> 01:06:53.890
You're not getting rid of me that easy.

01:07:35.859 --> 01:07:39.944
And yes it does concern me, because
I care about you all.

01:08:52.310 --> 01:08:55.678
What's this shit? Why are you following me?

01:08:56.022 --> 01:08:59.685
I wasn't. I'm not your...

01:09:00.484 --> 01:09:03.728
Okay, yeah, okay.
Maybe a little.

01:09:04.072 --> 01:09:08.362
I just want to... You don't say anything.

01:09:08.660 --> 01:09:12.198
Maybe I have a reason? Go home, Phil.

01:09:16.667 --> 01:09:17.658
Diane?

01:10:23.318 --> 01:10:24.104
Good morning!

01:10:26.780 --> 01:10:27.361
How's it going, handsome?

01:10:29.365 --> 01:10:29.946
Breakfast?

01:10:30.241 --> 01:10:31.527
Are there also greens?

01:10:31.826 --> 01:10:33.158
Not yet, but look who I bought!

01:10:33.453 --> 01:10:35.035
Surprise!

01:10:36.623 --> 01:10:38.740
Hey, I saw that you guys have
a shower in your garden.

01:10:39.042 --> 01:10:41.159
What's up, do you feel like it?
What's wrong with you?

01:10:41.461 --> 01:10:43.669
You look like you got hit by a
train or something.

01:10:45.423 --> 01:10:46.584
Okay, breakfast!

01:10:46.883 --> 01:10:48.124
Yeah, come!!

01:10:49.052 --> 01:10:50.042
Woo!

01:10:53.431 --> 01:10:56.139
Right on my ass. No. Stop. Stop!!

01:10:57.727 --> 01:11:00.891
Hey, boys.
I was thinking: I want to dye my hair.

01:11:01.189 --> 01:11:01.679
Black!

01:11:02.023 --> 01:11:02.558
Why not.

01:11:02.857 --> 01:11:05.349
Do it.

01:11:13.701 --> 01:11:16.614
Do you have any idea, how wonderful
of a man you're going to be?

01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:19.621
You think?

01:11:26.297 --> 01:11:30.041
Everything at home sucks.
And with you it's so great.

01:11:30.343 --> 01:11:31.879
I'm crazy about you.

01:11:33.179 --> 01:11:37.093
I feel sick when I'm not with you.
I can't think about anything else.

01:11:40.353 --> 01:11:42.515
Is it good or bad?

01:11:46.568 --> 01:11:48.901
You don't always have to be so dramatic.

01:12:10.341 --> 01:12:11.548
I love you.

01:12:45.752 --> 01:12:47.209
What's wrong?

01:12:47.629 --> 01:12:48.790
Nothing, just leave me alone.

01:12:54.636 --> 01:12:56.502
Hey, I'm sorry.

01:13:44.143 --> 01:13:46.726
Well, maybe he just has nothing
to talk about or to say.

01:13:47.230 --> 01:13:48.346
Ever though about that?

01:13:48.648 --> 01:13:52.517
Yeah, right.
Everyone has something to talk about.

01:13:53.861 --> 01:13:55.648
Where's Tereza?

01:13:57.156 --> 01:13:59.068
She'll be home late today.

01:13:59.575 --> 01:14:01.032
Nice.

01:14:01.577 --> 01:14:02.112
Tea?

01:14:02.578 --> 01:14:03.534
That's okay.

01:14:09.168 --> 01:14:12.002
Are you two happy? You and Tereza?

01:14:12.422 --> 01:14:21.388
Sometimes very, sometimes not so much.
But yeah, I think in general we're happy.

01:14:28.771 --> 01:14:32.856
I just don't know what he's really thinking.
You know, what he feels.

01:14:33.192 --> 01:14:34.524
What do I mean to him?

01:14:35.653 --> 01:14:36.985
Why don't you just ask him?

01:14:39.574 --> 01:14:43.067
You're worried about what he'll say.

01:14:43.369 --> 01:14:45.076
Glass also says that it's better not to ask.

01:14:45.371 --> 01:14:48.364
And you think Glass is the right person to
ask about this kind of thing?

01:14:49.250 --> 01:14:51.492
Oh hun, you're freaking me out. Sit down.

01:14:53.921 --> 01:14:57.039
Okay, what do you want from him?

01:14:57.425 --> 01:15:01.044
I don't know. More reassurance, I think.

01:15:01.346 --> 01:15:04.384
See? Now we're getting somewhere.
The bad news is: there is no

01:15:04.682 --> 01:15:06.264
reassurance in relationships.

01:15:08.978 --> 01:15:11.140
Then at least I wish he
wasn't so closed off.

01:15:11.481 --> 01:15:14.394
He knows everything about me, and I know
nothing about him.

01:15:14.692 --> 01:15:16.684
I feel like I don't know him at all.

01:15:20.990 --> 01:15:23.323
and I love him anyway.

01:15:23.868 --> 01:15:27.111
Not anyway, in spite of!
Maybe that's it?

01:15:27.455 --> 01:15:31.699
What fascinates you about him?
The mysterious Prince.

01:15:32.043 --> 01:15:32.829
Very funny.

01:15:34.712 --> 01:15:40.333
Hun! It's a wonder that you managed, out of
the millions of sperm, to make it, with that

01:15:40.635 --> 01:15:44.549
ambition of yours. Maybe it wouldn't
be such a bad idea to grab

01:15:44.847 --> 01:15:48.466
life by the balls a little, and
not just hang around.

01:15:49.519 --> 01:15:52.136
If you want answers, then do
something about it!

01:16:00.321 --> 01:16:04.156
Do your parents... You know...
Have you told them about us?

01:16:05.785 --> 01:16:09.074
No. They wouldn't understand.

01:16:09.747 --> 01:16:10.407
Oh, okay.

01:16:15.211 --> 01:16:19.125
So. This is the garden.

01:16:20.425 --> 01:16:22.041
This is the lawn.

01:16:22.343 --> 01:16:25.336
My mother has it mowed at least once a week.

01:16:26.055 --> 01:16:29.093
God forbid someone walk
by and see it unkept.

01:16:30.476 --> 01:16:36.222
And... This is the house. You coming?

01:16:36.899 --> 01:16:38.185
What's in there?

01:16:39.735 --> 01:16:42.022
Just things. Come on.

01:16:44.740 --> 01:16:46.276
Phil, it's really not important.

01:16:48.119 --> 01:16:49.360
You're hiding something.

01:16:49.662 --> 01:16:52.279
Come on, my parents aren't here.
I'll show you around.

01:16:56.043 --> 01:17:01.414
Phil, it's nothing exciting.

01:17:08.347 --> 01:17:09.337
May I?

01:17:24.197 --> 01:17:25.529
What is that?

01:17:26.824 --> 01:17:33.196
Those are... Things I've collected.

01:17:38.211 --> 01:17:40.874
These are all things that people
have lost or thrown out.

01:17:41.380 --> 01:17:43.337
Maybe others don't find them important.

01:17:44.300 --> 01:17:48.044
Or maybe they meant something to
someone once and now they're missed.

01:17:52.850 --> 01:17:56.969
I believe that people don't
just lose things by mistake.

01:17:57.438 --> 01:18:02.058
I mean, not on purpose, of course, you know?

01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:06.775
All of these things are a
symbol of disregard.

01:18:09.742 --> 01:18:15.534
I built my own world in here.
I gave these things a new life.

01:18:16.999 --> 01:18:19.082
And what do you do with them?

01:18:20.211 --> 01:18:27.050
Nothing.
Well... I think about their history.

01:18:32.431 --> 01:18:38.268
Sounds a bit psycho, right?
That's why I don't tell anyone about them.

01:18:38.563 --> 01:18:39.394
I... I...

01:18:48.823 --> 01:18:51.031
Do you have a favorite?

01:18:53.369 --> 01:18:54.450
Why?

01:18:58.499 --> 01:18:59.285
Come on.

01:19:13.639 --> 01:19:14.470
Hey!

01:20:21.749 --> 01:20:22.705
Hey!

01:20:25.503 --> 01:20:29.622
I made your chicken.
I thought you'd like to have some.

01:20:31.258 --> 01:20:32.123
Thanks

01:20:36.055 --> 01:20:38.172
When are you coming back?

01:20:39.433 --> 01:20:41.015
Are you speaking with Dianne again?

01:20:43.020 --> 01:20:45.478
That doesn't concern you, Phil.

01:20:46.190 --> 01:20:48.056
Yeah but I live here too,
so it does concern me.

01:20:50.277 --> 01:20:53.236
And it concerns Dianne too.
It concerns all three of us.

01:20:55.908 --> 01:20:58.241
I'm not going to let you
guys pressure me, Phil.

01:20:58.577 --> 01:21:00.034
Hey, come back here! You're being childish!

01:21:00.413 --> 01:21:02.621
I'll come back when you're back to normal.

01:21:04.750 --> 01:21:09.370
This atmosphere... I can't take it anymore.

01:21:10.297 --> 01:21:14.291
Phil. Phil! Phil!

01:21:16.595 --> 01:21:18.461
I'll talk to her.

01:21:19.682 --> 01:21:23.141
But you have to leave it to me,
to be ready, okay?

01:22:35.341 --> 01:22:45.340
♪ Beautiful world, where are you? ♪

01:22:51.065 --> 01:23:00.737
♪ Come back, lovely time
of nature's bloom. ♪

01:23:05.788 --> 01:23:15.787
♪ Come back, lovely time
of nature's bloom. ♪

01:23:43.242 --> 01:23:44.528
Telephone.

01:23:45.703 --> 01:23:47.615
Again... Phil?

01:23:50.833 --> 01:23:54.952
Sorry, he's still sleeping.
I'll let him know, yeah.

01:23:55.254 --> 01:23:55.584
Bye.

01:23:58.549 --> 01:24:03.340
I'm starting to run out of excuses.
Don't you have anything to say to Kat?

01:24:12.229 --> 01:24:15.438
I so hoped that everything would go well.

01:24:21.113 --> 01:24:23.821
Maybe you should thinking about
going back to Visible.

01:24:24.158 --> 01:24:25.399
Why to Visible?

01:24:25.701 --> 01:24:27.363
Because it's your home?

01:24:27.828 --> 01:24:30.787
Yeah, but I'm not going back there.

01:24:31.332 --> 01:24:33.073
Okay.

01:24:34.293 --> 01:24:36.000
How long are you going to hide for?

01:24:37.838 --> 01:24:42.128
No idea. Until the two of them make up.

01:24:44.845 --> 01:24:46.586
What if they need you to do that?

01:24:47.222 --> 01:24:48.133
They don't need me.

01:24:48.432 --> 01:24:51.550
They're so busy with their own problems
that they don't even see me anymore.

01:25:06.992 --> 01:25:10.827
Do you remember what I told you
about the house with all the rooms?

01:25:12.414 --> 01:25:14.326
That I can hide things in there.

01:25:14.625 --> 01:25:17.493
Exactly. What else?

01:25:20.214 --> 01:25:24.504
That you should never throw
the keys away. Why?

01:25:30.182 --> 01:25:35.598
Because maybe one day you'll realize that
the only way to get to the bigger, more

01:25:35.896 --> 01:25:39.355
beautiful part of the house is
through that room.

01:26:08.262 --> 01:26:09.503
Do you want to talk about it?

01:26:11.390 --> 01:26:12.346
Where's Dianne?

01:26:14.143 --> 01:26:15.725
Don't you first want to talk about...

01:26:16.061 --> 01:26:17.097
Her things weren't outside.

01:26:18.439 --> 01:26:19.975
Where is she?

01:26:23.110 --> 01:26:25.272
She moved out right after you did.

01:26:30.409 --> 01:26:31.365
Where?

01:26:32.494 --> 01:26:34.406
She didn't say.

01:26:40.794 --> 01:26:44.583
Glass. What happened?

01:26:44.882 --> 01:26:48.091
Phil. I don't think now's the time...

01:26:48.385 --> 01:26:49.421
Mum.

01:26:53.223 --> 01:26:54.134
Please.

01:26:56.685 --> 01:26:58.677
But it's so hard to understand.

01:26:59.021 --> 01:27:00.478
Then give it a shot.

01:27:03.442 --> 01:27:09.939
Just try. I'm here. I won't run away.

01:27:22.503 --> 01:27:23.459
Okay, fine.

01:27:31.136 --> 01:27:35.426
You know the albums, right?
In the bookshelf.

01:27:35.724 --> 01:27:39.889
The big ones with the pressed flowers...

01:27:40.395 --> 01:27:43.433
This all happened so long ago.

01:27:45.651 --> 01:27:48.109
The page. What was on it?

01:28:38.912 --> 01:28:41.905
A long time ago, women used to make
themselves more attractive to men using

01:28:42.249 --> 01:28:43.365
poison from the Belladonna plant.

01:28:43.667 --> 01:28:44.908
With poison?

01:28:47.421 --> 01:28:48.127
Hey!

01:28:49.381 --> 01:28:52.795
In small doses, poison from the Belladonna
plant dilated your pupils and made your eyes

01:28:53.135 --> 01:28:54.216
bigger and more beautiful.

01:28:54.511 --> 01:28:56.503
And that made you more appealing?

01:28:56.805 --> 01:28:58.512
Sure, when you had nothing better to offer.

01:29:00.058 --> 01:29:08.307
And what they brought upon themselves with
their attractiveness, they... Zick...

01:29:08.609 --> 01:29:10.976
eliminated with higher doses of the poison.

01:29:11.570 --> 01:29:13.186
What does that mean?

01:29:17.242 --> 01:29:18.278
Come on, let's go.

01:29:58.533 --> 01:29:59.193
Dianne!

01:30:00.327 --> 01:30:01.283
Hey.

01:30:02.663 --> 01:30:04.780
Glass said you moved out.

01:30:06.625 --> 01:30:08.241
Where are you living now?

01:30:08.543 --> 01:30:11.081
At Kora's.
She's tutoring me in math.

01:30:11.380 --> 01:30:12.040
You know..

01:30:12.339 --> 01:30:14.581
Sure.
Tereza still has some space.

01:30:14.883 --> 01:30:19.423
Or if there's anything you need from home,
I could bring it over.

01:30:19.721 --> 01:30:20.427
It's alright.

01:30:28.563 --> 01:30:32.523
It wasn't an accident, was it?
It was planned.

01:30:34.861 --> 01:30:35.521
Why?

01:30:36.780 --> 01:30:38.271
Phil, it was a long time ago.

01:30:38.907 --> 01:30:42.241
Dianne, what happened?

01:30:53.588 --> 01:30:59.050
You already know.
Glass kicked all of them out.

01:31:00.846 --> 01:31:08.185
With her actions and her style.
And every time, we ended up alone again.

01:31:09.896 --> 01:31:12.309
At some point, I came to terms with it.

01:31:15.610 --> 01:31:20.822
And then Kyle came.
He liked us and we liked him.

01:31:21.450 --> 01:31:25.160
And it sprang up again.
The hope.

01:31:27.205 --> 01:31:36.501
That we... God, it sounds so... That we
could maybe be a real family again.

01:31:39.134 --> 01:31:45.722
And then she distanced herself again.
And I was so... So angry.

01:31:48.185 --> 01:31:50.427
All I wished for was another mother.

01:31:51.438 --> 01:31:57.560
And then I thought, if she could take our
father away, then she didn't

01:31:57.903 --> 01:31:59.940
deserve another child.

01:32:06.536 --> 01:32:09.700
Mama almost died.

01:32:12.209 --> 01:32:13.950
And it was my fault.

01:32:16.630 --> 01:32:20.965
I shut myself off, and kept
it a secret. Forever.

01:32:21.426 --> 01:32:26.421
Sometimes I can almost forget, but every
time I see her digging in the garden,

01:32:26.723 --> 01:32:27.964
it all comes back.

01:32:30.102 --> 01:32:33.095
And when I left, you wanted to...

01:32:33.605 --> 01:32:40.444
No... I never wanted to tell her.
I have to come to terms with it

01:32:40.737 --> 01:32:42.979
myself first, but...

01:32:45.742 --> 01:32:49.361
About a year ago, I met someone.

01:32:50.372 --> 01:32:51.158
Jan?

01:32:52.541 --> 01:32:53.406
How do you know about that?

01:32:53.708 --> 01:32:56.166
The letters. I found them in your room.

01:33:00.507 --> 01:33:03.545
But why didn't you talk about it?

01:33:05.429 --> 01:33:08.513
No idea, it was too fresh.

01:33:10.559 --> 01:33:14.724
It was something special, and fragile.
Jan was good for me.

01:33:17.107 --> 01:33:19.895
He got me and could handle my anger.

01:33:21.153 --> 01:33:27.616
But then there was that storm in the summer.
Everything started flying around.

01:33:27.951 --> 01:33:34.824
Tiles fell from rooftops and trees were
uprooted and flung around like toothpicks.

01:33:36.126 --> 01:33:40.416
Jan was on his way to Visible. To me.

01:33:45.469 --> 01:33:48.007
But he never made it.

01:33:51.475 --> 01:33:52.431
Come with me.

01:34:08.241 --> 01:34:11.575
This is Jan.
I come to see him almost everyday.

01:34:12.287 --> 01:34:15.746
I thought he would die without me.

01:34:16.583 --> 01:34:18.199
Crazy, right?

01:34:19.252 --> 01:34:20.368
God, Dianne.

01:34:22.422 --> 01:34:23.003
Come.

01:34:25.008 --> 01:34:26.215
Come on.

01:34:32.516 --> 01:34:33.927
I felt so guilty.

01:34:40.023 --> 01:34:44.358
I needed someone to catch me and hold me.

01:34:47.030 --> 01:34:48.396
She wasn't there.

01:34:55.121 --> 01:34:57.909
She was with busy with yet another guy.

01:35:00.669 --> 01:35:03.036
She started saying how she
wanted another child.

01:35:06.424 --> 01:35:11.089
Everything came back to me.
And I told her what happened.

01:35:14.182 --> 01:35:19.177
It's like I was 10 again and helpless.

01:35:23.316 --> 01:35:29.278
I screamed at her, told her I wished
she had died that day.

01:35:29.573 --> 01:35:31.189
Oh, no.

01:35:32.534 --> 01:35:33.615
Oh, yes.

01:35:41.084 --> 01:35:44.122
Phil, you weren't there.

01:35:48.258 --> 01:35:50.625
Come home.

01:35:53.305 --> 01:35:54.170
And you?

01:35:56.433 --> 01:36:01.553
I'm there. I'm back.

01:36:16.453 --> 01:36:16.818
Hi.

01:36:19.539 --> 01:36:20.199
Phil?

01:36:32.427 --> 01:36:34.214
What's up? You're acting strange.

01:36:39.517 --> 01:36:44.763
I saw you. You and Kat. In your shed.

01:36:49.444 --> 01:36:52.152
How could you?
I though that we were, somehow...

01:36:57.327 --> 01:36:58.113
Do you love her?

01:36:59.371 --> 01:37:01.363
Phil, I...

01:37:04.334 --> 01:37:04.790
No.

01:37:09.422 --> 01:37:10.629
Do you love me?

01:37:17.263 --> 01:37:23.555
How do you know that... That, that
feeling you have for me... That it's love?

01:37:28.441 --> 01:37:29.272
I need you.

01:37:30.110 --> 01:37:30.896
Need?

01:37:31.194 --> 01:37:33.356
Like lungs need air or like you
need the newest iPhone?

01:37:33.697 --> 01:37:34.653
That's not fair.

01:37:34.989 --> 01:37:36.901
Unfair? You're telling me what's unfair?

01:37:37.367 --> 01:37:42.408
Why does anything have to change?
We have a good time together.

01:37:44.082 --> 01:37:48.201
Phil, I really really like you.
Why can't we just keeping going like this.

01:37:48.503 --> 01:37:49.414
The three of us...

01:37:49.713 --> 01:37:53.753
It doesn't work like that.
That won't work for me.

01:37:54.050 --> 01:37:56.633
It's not enough, don't you get it?

01:38:08.982 --> 01:38:14.273
Phil, I can't imagine my life without you.
But I need Kat too.

01:38:14.571 --> 01:38:16.278
I need both of you.

01:38:22.036 --> 01:38:27.327
Nicholas, I can't share you. I just can't.

01:39:07.123 --> 01:39:07.783
I'm sorry.

01:39:10.710 --> 01:39:17.583
Phil. Phil! Phil!

01:40:01.636 --> 01:40:02.592
Um...

01:40:04.389 --> 01:40:11.387
If there's ever even the smallest chance,
that you think about talking to me in the

01:40:11.729 --> 01:40:16.895
next hundred years. Phil, I just
want you to know that I'll wait for you.

01:40:19.904 --> 01:40:22.442
I'll wait for your forever,
if that's what it takes!

01:40:44.262 --> 01:40:46.219
Happy New Year! Cheers!!

01:40:49.183 --> 01:40:55.931
Open it! Open it! Open it!

01:40:59.319 --> 01:41:01.231
It's just a small survival
kit for your trip.

01:41:05.491 --> 01:41:06.607
Who was it?

01:41:07.118 --> 01:41:09.952
No idea, nobody was there, but this was.

01:41:39.525 --> 01:41:40.811
You're starting without me?

01:41:44.364 --> 01:41:44.945
Baby

01:41:45.239 --> 01:41:46.446
To your trip!

01:41:47.075 --> 01:41:49.158
To your trip! To America!

01:41:57.877 --> 01:41:59.743
I have a little something for you.

01:42:02.882 --> 01:42:06.626
I thought it would be more useful than that
old map you have under your bed.

01:42:07.845 --> 01:42:08.460
Thanks!

01:42:15.103 --> 01:42:18.938
If you actually meet him,
send me a picture, yeah?

01:42:19.774 --> 01:42:20.560
Who?

01:42:21.150 --> 01:42:22.186
Number 3!

01:42:22.735 --> 01:42:24.397
I thought you didn't care about that.

01:42:25.571 --> 01:42:28.188
Whatever, you shouldn't be so radical.

01:42:31.661 --> 01:42:33.368
It would be so great, if you came with me.

01:42:33.871 --> 01:42:41.745
One of us has to get their shit together.
Besides, what can happen in three weeks?

01:42:45.550 --> 01:42:49.635
First, I'm going to rip up that list.
It should've been done a long time ago.

01:42:52.181 --> 01:42:53.046
What?

01:42:53.683 --> 01:42:55.675
I did it already.
As you said, it should've been

01:42:55.977 --> 01:42:56.967
done a long time ago.

01:43:11.451 --> 01:43:12.237
Are you sleeping?

01:43:12.535 --> 01:43:15.152
I don't think I'll be able to sleep tonight.

01:43:16.414 --> 01:43:21.375
I just wanted to say goodbye.
Who knows if I can get up so early.

01:43:21.878 --> 01:43:23.335
Sit down, cruel mother.

01:43:26.424 --> 01:43:27.585
Excited?

01:43:27.884 --> 01:43:30.467
Me? Not at all!

01:43:36.184 --> 01:43:39.518
Listen up, Phil.
I have an idea.

01:43:39.854 --> 01:43:46.192
You can ask me anything you want quickly.
And I'll answer.

01:43:50.031 --> 01:43:50.771
Okay.

01:43:57.163 --> 01:43:58.404
What's his name?

01:44:01.167 --> 01:44:02.248
Next question

01:44:06.756 --> 01:44:07.542
Where does he live?

01:44:12.136 --> 01:44:13.672
Yeah right. This is starting out well.

01:44:17.308 --> 01:44:22.724
Okay, then - how was he?

01:44:33.032 --> 01:44:38.448
He was... He was wonderful.

01:44:40.790 --> 01:44:43.498
He was the most wonderful man
that could have ever existed.

01:44:43.793 --> 01:44:46.376
If he was so amazing, then
why did he leave you?

01:44:49.966 --> 01:44:51.047
He didn't.

01:44:54.178 --> 01:44:56.090
We loved each other incredibly much.

01:44:58.516 --> 01:45:03.181
He was so good-natured,
so sensitive.

01:45:04.355 --> 01:45:08.224
When he touched a flower,
it would start to bloom.

01:45:09.402 --> 01:45:11.394
I swear, I saw it.

01:45:11.696 --> 01:45:18.364
Butterflies, moths, all insects.
He attracted them like a flame.

01:45:21.247 --> 01:45:22.203
Like Dianne.

01:45:24.292 --> 01:45:25.749
Like Dianne.

01:45:26.085 --> 01:45:29.920
But it has nothing to do
with creepy crawlers at all.

01:45:30.214 --> 01:45:36.677
It was about this overwhelming empathy.

01:45:37.013 --> 01:45:39.471
This vulnerability.

01:45:40.099 --> 01:45:44.093
Haven't you seen what
happens to these people?

01:45:44.395 --> 01:45:46.728
I was always afraid of him.

01:45:50.067 --> 01:45:51.524
And then? What happened?

01:45:51.819 --> 01:45:59.238
And then I got pregnant.

01:46:00.786 --> 01:46:04.655
Suddenly, I was afraid of you.

01:46:07.627 --> 01:46:11.496
And then it was clear.
It would never work with him.

01:46:11.797 --> 01:46:12.457
Never.

01:46:16.677 --> 01:46:22.719
So I just took off.
And I thought, yeah, once I'm gone.

01:46:23.851 --> 01:46:24.341
And...?

01:46:26.604 --> 01:46:34.228
I had no idea how bad my conscience
would be, and how much it hurt.

01:46:39.450 --> 01:46:41.737
Why didn't you ever tell us?

01:46:44.288 --> 01:46:45.278
Because it was easier that way.

01:46:45.581 --> 01:46:46.537
What?

01:46:46.832 --> 01:46:50.496
Not to talk about it.

01:46:54.632 --> 01:47:04.099
Oh Phil, if only there was an
easy answer for everything...

01:47:04.392 --> 01:47:10.059
I hope that you make all
your dreams come true.

01:47:10.356 --> 01:47:12.473
But be careful, and don't expect too much.

01:47:12.775 --> 01:47:13.606
And don't be sad.

01:47:13.901 --> 01:47:14.357
Mom?

01:47:14.652 --> 01:47:15.017
Yeah?

01:47:18.614 --> 01:47:20.105
What's our father's name?

01:48:19.508 --> 01:48:21.170
I thought we didn't do this anymore.

01:48:21.469 --> 01:48:22.585
Take care of yourself.

01:48:22.887 --> 01:48:24.298
Guys, I'm going to pee myself in a minute.

01:48:32.772 --> 01:48:33.603
Phil?

01:48:57.463 --> 01:49:01.377
That's still me.
And that's still my family.

01:49:01.675 --> 01:49:04.088
I'm really going to miss them.
Everyday.

01:49:04.387 --> 01:49:06.299
Even Glass' cooking.

01:49:10.351 --> 01:49:13.219
For now, this is no longer
the house I live in.

01:49:13.521 --> 01:49:17.936
And the small people, with their small
lives don't matter anymore.

01:49:20.277 --> 01:49:24.772
It's all incredibly complicated here.
But there's one thing I'm sure of:

01:49:25.116 --> 01:49:28.234
the center of my world is
right here, where they are.

01:49:44.135 --> 01:49:46.127
Will I find him?
I have no idea.

01:49:46.429 --> 01:49:50.764
And maybe he really is a seafaring
adventurer, or a cowboy on a ranch,

01:49:51.100 --> 01:49:52.887
or a hippie or a transvestite or a loser,

01:49:53.185 --> 01:49:55.051
or maybe he sells weapons
to desperate housewives.

01:49:55.354 --> 01:49:57.141
What do I know?

01:49:57.815 --> 01:49:59.681
The answer isn't
important anymore.

01:50:00.025 --> 01:50:02.312
I can feel the emptiness
in me getting smaller.

01:50:06.282 --> 01:50:08.069
But now I want to open a few doors.

01:50:09.305 --> 01:50:15.577
