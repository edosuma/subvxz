00:37.400 --> 00:41.007
In early 1843, Europe,
ruled by absolute monarchs,

00:41.200 --> 00:45.524
wracked by crises, famine and recession,
is on the verge of change.

00:45.720 --> 00:50.282
In England, the industrial revolution
transforms the world's order

00:50.520 --> 00:53.649
and creates the new proletarian class.

00:53.840 --> 00:56.081
Workers' organizations are founded,

00:56.280 --> 00:59.887
based on a "communist" utopia
in which all men are brothers.

01:00.080 --> 01:03.801
Two young Germans
will disrupt this notion,

01:04.000 --> 01:07.846
thereby transforming the struggle...
and the world's future.

01:11.880 --> 01:16.727
THE YOUNG KARL MARX

01:53.120 --> 01:54.963
To gather green wood,

01:55.720 --> 01:59.247
one must rip it violently
from the living tree.

02:00.560 --> 02:02.881
Yet gathering dead wood

02:03.080 --> 02:04.730
removes nothing from the property.

02:04.920 --> 02:07.287
Only what is already separated

02:07.520 --> 02:09.204
is removed from the property.

02:15.440 --> 02:20.526
Despite this essential difference,
you call both acts theft

02:20.800 --> 02:23.371
and punish them as such.

02:46.280 --> 02:49.204
Montesquieu names
two kinds of corruption.

02:53.200 --> 02:56.409
One when the people
do not observe the laws.

02:57.160 --> 03:00.846
The other
when the laws corrupt them.

03:41.760 --> 03:44.764
You have erased the difference
between theft and gathering.

03:45.400 --> 03:48.961
But you are wrong to believe
it is in your interest.

03:51.000 --> 03:55.449
The people see the punishment,
but not the crime.

03:58.280 --> 04:00.169
Cologne, April 1843

04:00.360 --> 04:02.522
And, as they do not see a crime...

04:03.600 --> 04:05.364
when they are punished,

04:05.600 --> 04:07.204
you should fear them,

04:08.000 --> 04:10.048
for they will take revenge.

04:10.760 --> 04:12.842
So, Karl, satisfied?

04:15.640 --> 04:17.880
Am I satisfied, Stirner?

04:19.760 --> 04:20.841
I don't know.

04:21.040 --> 04:23.566
It's partly due to you
that it's come to this.

04:23.760 --> 04:25.171
Two things satisfy me:

04:25.360 --> 04:27.408
that my article
has had an effect

04:27.640 --> 04:30.405
and that Prussian despotism
reveals itself at last.

04:30.640 --> 04:33.405
- Yes, that satisfies me.
- And the paper...

04:33.640 --> 04:36.086
Gagged and dismantled
our words muzzled.

04:36.360 --> 04:38.408
- Us imprisoned.
- What could I do?

04:39.040 --> 04:41.691
Remain silent? Censor myself?

04:41.880 --> 04:43.848
Be content with allusions like you?

04:44.120 --> 04:45.565
- Very smart!
- Be fair.

04:45.760 --> 04:48.331
What are we victims of?
Our success.

04:48.560 --> 04:51.166
Success that we owe above all
to Karl's writings!

04:51.360 --> 04:54.569
And what is the result?
We're finished!

04:54.760 --> 04:56.125
A fine success! Bravo!

04:59.000 --> 05:00.809
Don't open the door!

05:01.000 --> 05:03.287
If they break it down,
they'll slaughter us!

05:03.520 --> 05:04.646
- So?
- Stop it!

05:04.840 --> 05:07.241
Shut your mouth! Enough.

05:08.400 --> 05:10.209
Why are we trembling?

05:10.920 --> 05:15.209
They can kill the Rheinische Zeitung,
they can try to gag us,

05:15.400 --> 05:17.402
but they cannot kill thought!

05:17.640 --> 05:19.847
We won't surrender!
We'll found...

05:20.040 --> 05:21.804
- A new paper?
- Yes.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.446
- We'll find funds...
- With the same nonsense?

05:24.680 --> 05:26.967
The Rheinische Zeitung,
nonsense?

05:27.160 --> 05:29.731
Scribbles urging world revolution,

05:29.920 --> 05:31.888
devoid of ideas and concepts.

05:34.880 --> 05:36.006
What do you do?

05:36.200 --> 05:39.249
Produce some vague understatements,

05:39.440 --> 05:41.602
vague literary reviews,

05:41.800 --> 05:43.848
vague socialist theories.

05:44.040 --> 05:46.407
Take that back!
I'm sick of your arrogance.

05:46.640 --> 05:48.005
We all are!

05:51.320 --> 05:52.320
Right...

05:53.160 --> 05:57.370
I'm sick of you too, Bauer,
and all you Young Hegelians,

05:57.600 --> 05:59.682
"free thinkers"
as you call yourselves.

05:59.880 --> 06:01.769
Have fun, you clowns!

06:01.960 --> 06:04.884
No, Ruge!
I've enough fighting with pins.

06:05.080 --> 06:06.605
I want a sledgehammer!

06:06.800 --> 06:10.566
Enough hypocrisy, stupidity
and brutal authority.

06:10.760 --> 06:13.047
They've banned us? Good!

06:13.240 --> 06:14.924
What are you doing?

06:15.120 --> 06:17.361
A few nights in jail
will do us good.

06:17.600 --> 06:19.523
Gentlemen, I'm all yours.

06:23.720 --> 06:26.371
- Come along!
- Hands off me!

06:26.800 --> 06:28.165
Hurry it up!

06:35.800 --> 06:38.371
- I have an offer for you...
- Quiet!

06:44.760 --> 06:46.888
I want to start a new journal.

06:47.320 --> 06:49.288
Different, freer.

06:49.960 --> 06:51.803
More modern, bolder.

06:54.400 --> 06:57.131
What would you say to Paris?

07:13.880 --> 07:16.042
Manchester, England

07:16.280 --> 07:19.648
They took the lids off the steam looms.
People got burnt.

07:19.840 --> 07:22.241
This has to stop!
It's intolerable!

07:22.440 --> 07:27.048
Ermen & Engels Mill

07:39.240 --> 07:41.447
Who cut the belts?

07:43.560 --> 07:46.370
Ten to one
it was those Irish dogs.

07:47.520 --> 07:50.444
- What about Roisin?
- Yeah, what about Roisin?

07:50.680 --> 07:54.765
The girl who fell asleep at the loom
and got her fingers cut off, eh?

07:55.160 --> 07:57.447
Who'll give her back her fingers?

07:57.680 --> 07:59.364
- May I?
- Be quiet.

07:59.680 --> 08:04.288
It'll teach her to pay more attention.
You lot are paid to work, not to sleep.

08:04.560 --> 08:06.688
- We do work!
- Careful.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.641
- You're stirring them up.
- Paid?

08:10.080 --> 08:13.846
She hadn't slept in three days,
and now she can go off and die?

08:14.040 --> 08:16.327
- Call that a job?
- Quiet!

08:17.440 --> 08:20.364
The repairs
will be docked from your wages.

08:20.680 --> 08:25.527
That's all you get out of it.
You're lucky I don't sack the lot of you!

08:26.320 --> 08:30.644
Repairing machines is expensive.
Not like labor in Manchester.

08:32.520 --> 08:35.091
Ten fingers is all we're worth.

08:35.360 --> 08:38.921
And if we lose them,
we're fit for the scrap heap, is that it?

08:39.679 --> 08:42.445
She's the one
who was talking about Roisin.

08:42.679 --> 08:45.251
- She's the ringleader.
- What was her name?

08:45.440 --> 08:48.410
Ask me, boss.
I have a mouth myself.

08:48.840 --> 08:51.002
A big one too, by the sound of it.

08:51.960 --> 08:54.247
My name is Mary Burns.

08:57.280 --> 08:59.931
I was born in Tipperary, and now

09:00.120 --> 09:05.001
a slave at the Ermen and Engels
Spinning Mill in Manchester, England.

09:09.600 --> 09:11.648
Get rid of her.

09:12.040 --> 09:14.247
She can find her food elsewhere.

09:14.440 --> 09:16.568
You heard him. Get out!

09:17.120 --> 09:20.090
And anyone else
with big ideas can go with her.

09:51.120 --> 09:54.841
You have to weed out the bad apples.
I want a list...

09:55.720 --> 09:58.803
of all the troublemakers
and rabble-rousers.

09:59.160 --> 10:01.811
Father, don't you think that's enough?

10:04.040 --> 10:06.281
You want to tell me
how to run a factory?

10:07.160 --> 10:08.525
No, Father.

10:09.360 --> 10:11.249
That is not my ambition...

10:15.800 --> 10:18.167
- Hey!
- Maybe next time.

11:23.400 --> 11:25.846
- Excuse me. What's in there?
- In there?

11:26.200 --> 11:28.601
- The Irish.
- Alright, thank you.

11:28.800 --> 11:31.531
If I were you, I'd avoid it.

11:58.200 --> 11:59.690
Let me introduce myself.

11:59.880 --> 12:01.564
- We know who you are.
- Shut up.

12:01.840 --> 12:03.569
Why are you talking to him?

12:04.600 --> 12:07.410
- He's the boss's son.
- Who? Which boss?

12:08.200 --> 12:11.090
He's the Engels son
from Ermen and Engels mills

12:11.440 --> 12:13.329
on Regent Road and Bridgewater.

12:13.680 --> 12:17.366
Where we worked our fingers to the bone
till today, when we got sacked.

12:17.760 --> 12:20.161
Yes, I am the Engels son.

12:20.920 --> 12:24.891
My first name's Friedrich,
but you can call me Fred, or Freddy.

12:25.200 --> 12:27.771
What do you want?
This is no place for you.

12:28.120 --> 12:32.011
There's plenty of pubs across the Irwell
for gentlemen like you.

12:32.360 --> 12:34.806
Gentlemen who throw us out like dogs.

12:35.680 --> 12:38.081
Like the Irish dogs we are.

12:40.320 --> 12:43.244
- We're all Irish dogs here, right, Paddy?
- Yeah.

12:43.840 --> 12:48.448
And I know one who'll spit his baccy juice
all over this gentleman's shiny boots.

12:48.680 --> 12:50.728
- Mind yourself.
- I'd get over it.

12:51.880 --> 12:56.124
And please stop calling me a gentleman.
I'm neither English nor a gentleman.

12:56.320 --> 12:58.004
You don't say.

12:58.880 --> 13:01.121
I hate and despise gentlemen.

13:01.760 --> 13:05.048
They are swine who grow fat
on the sweat of laborers.

13:07.160 --> 13:09.561
He's making fun of us.

13:10.560 --> 13:14.451
You know what I think, fellas?
I think he came to have a laugh at us.

13:14.720 --> 13:18.088
- He's got nerves.
- I've come here to enlist your help.

13:18.560 --> 13:21.086
- That's why I came.
- He wants to enlist us?

13:21.360 --> 13:24.250
- What sort of a list will that be?
- I'm writing a book.

13:24.440 --> 13:27.728
- I need first-hand accounts.
- A book? He's writing a book?

13:28.840 --> 13:33.164
About the condition of the working class
in Manchester and Leeds.

13:41.840 --> 13:44.207
Is that a gold clock you got there?

13:46.800 --> 13:49.280
- Whose sweat bought you this?
- Okay, Paddy.

13:49.680 --> 13:53.651
- Let's not make a big fuss about this.
- You want a first-hand account?

13:54.440 --> 13:56.920
Well, here's a worker's hand, see?

13:58.040 --> 14:02.125
You'll get it on your gentleman's nose
if you don't get out right now.

14:03.240 --> 14:05.527
So be gone.

14:13.160 --> 14:15.447
What if I'd rather stay?

14:27.920 --> 14:29.968
You alright, mister?

14:31.000 --> 14:32.729
You hurt?

14:37.440 --> 14:38.440
Yes...

14:40.080 --> 14:42.162
Wonderfully!

14:47.160 --> 14:50.767
Paris, July 1844

14:57.320 --> 14:58.890
What is it, Alphonsine?

14:59.080 --> 15:01.447
Nothing, Madam Jenny, she woke.

15:06.040 --> 15:07.451
Leave her with me.

15:14.320 --> 15:17.051
I don't trust little Alphonsine.

15:17.240 --> 15:20.323
She steals from us,
she snoops, she's false...

15:21.880 --> 15:25.521
Let her steal.
We owe her two months' pay.

15:28.440 --> 15:29.805
Lenchen...

15:30.960 --> 15:32.086
My Lenchen.

15:32.960 --> 15:35.327
If Lenchen could join us here...

15:48.200 --> 15:49.884
You miss Trier.

15:52.080 --> 15:53.080
No.

15:54.960 --> 15:56.371
I miss Lenchen.

15:59.120 --> 16:01.043
She learnt French in Metz.

16:02.280 --> 16:06.444
Your loyal servant,
your big house, your huge estate,

16:07.360 --> 16:09.931
your beloved family.
I took you away. For what?

16:10.560 --> 16:12.244
I can't even get Ruge to pay me!

16:12.800 --> 16:13.800
Karl...

16:15.200 --> 16:17.567
Do you know what your worst flaw is?

16:17.760 --> 16:18.760
Go on.

16:18.920 --> 16:20.649
- You're unfair.
- I am?

16:20.840 --> 16:23.605
Yes, unfair with others.

16:23.800 --> 16:26.610
With me. With Ruge.

16:27.040 --> 16:29.441
Ruge pays badly,
but he gave us Paris.

16:31.680 --> 16:34.684
He gave you to me. Without this trip,
we wouldn't be married.

16:34.880 --> 16:37.167
You think that without Paris...

16:40.120 --> 16:42.726
I'm happy, Karl.

17:28.840 --> 17:33.721
if they don't accept the fact

17:33.920 --> 17:37.447
That we love each other

17:37.680 --> 17:40.524
Then good night!

17:41.920 --> 17:45.083
Even if it annoys people

17:45.280 --> 17:49.001
Even if it annoys people

17:49.640 --> 17:53.281
I love you all the same...

18:16.160 --> 18:20.722
You have to introduce your mother
to her granddaughter one day.

18:23.000 --> 18:26.243
- I should return to Trier?
- Not for long.

18:29.640 --> 18:32.769
Perhaps I could obtain
some money from Mother.

18:32.960 --> 18:35.964
- Yes.
- Why not? It's an idea.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
Karl...

18:39.960 --> 18:42.964
If Jennychen and I
are too much of a burden...

18:43.160 --> 18:45.128
- Now you're being unfair.
- No.

18:45.320 --> 18:47.049
It's a wonderful idea.

18:47.240 --> 18:51.768
My reactionary brother will be delighted
to see me come home to beg.

18:52.600 --> 18:53.931
Forget what I said.

18:54.120 --> 18:56.361
I can already hear his sermons

18:56.600 --> 19:02.164
on his sister's misalliance
with that damn socialist atheist Jew

19:02.360 --> 19:06.160
who cannot even feed his family
with his subversive writings.

19:06.360 --> 19:10.888
I shall tell you everything!
You'll hear every last bitter word.

19:11.560 --> 19:12.607
All right.

19:13.400 --> 19:14.765
You win.

19:18.040 --> 19:20.008
I'm working on two books.

19:21.400 --> 19:22.765
Plus my articles.

19:24.840 --> 19:27.161
You should tidy up.

19:30.800 --> 19:31.801
Here.

19:34.560 --> 19:35.561
As for Ruge...

19:36.320 --> 19:37.731
You're too patient.

19:38.640 --> 19:39.880
He isn't poor.

19:40.800 --> 19:44.361
He has shares
in the Cologne-Antwerp railway.

19:44.960 --> 19:45.960
Ruge?

19:47.440 --> 19:49.807
Yes, everyone knows.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.650
I didn't know.

20:02.200 --> 20:04.362
Try my cigars! Toscanis!

20:04.600 --> 20:06.762
Londres! Coronas!

20:07.920 --> 20:09.126
Cigars!

20:10.720 --> 20:11.926
Cigars!

20:13.920 --> 20:15.160
A cigar.

20:15.360 --> 20:18.842
Choose, citizen.
Robusta, Corona, Londres...

20:19.600 --> 20:20.965
Cheaper...

20:22.200 --> 20:23.281
This one.

20:24.120 --> 20:26.407
Three sous, if you can smoke it.

20:28.800 --> 20:29.800
Two for five?

20:29.960 --> 20:31.086
Citizens!

20:31.280 --> 20:34.443
I shall give the floor
to a man from Lyons

20:34.680 --> 20:38.765
who honors us with his presence.
Our dear and great Proudhon!

20:44.240 --> 20:46.720
Friends, comrades, citizens!

20:47.520 --> 20:51.809
I'm delighted to be here with you
at this republican banquet.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.923
Long live Proudhon!

20:54.120 --> 20:57.920
They wanted to ban these banquets
for they fear your anger,

20:58.120 --> 20:59.963
and so they should!

21:00.160 --> 21:01.160
That's true!

21:01.320 --> 21:04.403
For the people
always outnumber the police,

21:04.640 --> 21:07.325
just as the thirst for freedom
exceeds repression!

21:07.560 --> 21:09.722
- Down with Guizot!
- Up with craftsmen!

21:09.920 --> 21:10.748
It's you!

21:10.840 --> 21:13.047
You are the craftsmen,

21:13.240 --> 21:15.720
the weavers, the cobblers,

21:15.920 --> 21:18.082
the tailors, the carpenters,

21:18.280 --> 21:20.442
who create this country's wealth!

21:20.680 --> 21:22.250
What about the workers?

21:22.440 --> 21:25.091
The navies, the mechanics,
the smelters!

21:25.280 --> 21:26.805
I'm not forgetting them!

21:27.000 --> 21:29.446
Those men, women and children

21:29.680 --> 21:33.651
chained to the new machines
of fire and brimstone

21:34.120 --> 21:38.444
without enough bread at times
to keep up their strength...

21:38.680 --> 21:41.365
I'll say it clearly and simply!

21:41.600 --> 21:43.364
They're being murdered!

21:45.080 --> 21:46.889
And now to my subject...

21:47.080 --> 21:49.242
What is slavery?

21:49.720 --> 21:53.964
If I reply that it's murder,
you immediately agree.

21:54.160 --> 21:58.722
So when I ask,
"What is property?",

21:58.920 --> 22:02.845
if I reply that it's theft,
must I continually explain myself?

22:03.040 --> 22:05.042
Property? But which property?

22:05.240 --> 22:07.368
Private, bourgeois property?

22:07.960 --> 22:10.201
I know that man. He's Karl Marx.

22:11.600 --> 22:13.045
Property in general,

22:13.240 --> 22:16.130
given as a natural right like liberty,

22:16.320 --> 22:17.685
equality or security.

22:17.880 --> 22:19.325
They're abstractions.

22:19.560 --> 22:20.925
They're rights!

22:21.600 --> 22:22.726
Natural rights!

22:23.600 --> 22:26.080
The liberty, equality and security

22:26.280 --> 22:28.931
of each citizen,
do not affect those of all

22:29.120 --> 22:31.122
but strengthen them!

22:32.160 --> 22:35.243
They are natural social rights!

22:35.920 --> 22:39.083
Property, on the other hand,
necessarily hampers

22:39.280 --> 22:42.568
the liberty, equality and security
of others.

22:42.760 --> 22:46.242
As a natural right, it is antisocial!

22:48.160 --> 22:52.449
Therefore I do not demand
its extension to all,

22:52.680 --> 22:55.729
but simply its abolition!

22:55.920 --> 22:57.285
Bravo! Viva!

22:57.880 --> 23:01.282
Down with property, the king, the state!

23:01.520 --> 23:03.090
Long live anarchy!

23:05.560 --> 23:07.847
Yes, Mikhail, I agree with you.

23:08.040 --> 23:10.930
But, careful,
enemy ears are listening.

23:21.840 --> 23:24.446
Mikhail Alexandrovich Bakunin.

23:25.200 --> 23:27.965
You found fault with the Master.

23:28.520 --> 23:30.124
They call him the Master.

23:30.320 --> 23:33.164
I know no master, no god, no king.

23:33.360 --> 23:36.170
Karl Marx. I'm no anarchist.

23:36.360 --> 23:37.930
I thought as much.

23:38.120 --> 23:41.329
I read The German-French Annals.
Your hand.

23:42.200 --> 23:44.965
I sense the blood
stirring in a man's veins.

23:45.160 --> 23:47.686
And it stirs in the veins
of your writing.

23:48.840 --> 23:51.810
You read The Annals?
Why not write for them?

23:54.680 --> 23:57.570
Proudhon, allow me to introduce Marx

23:57.760 --> 23:59.524
of The German-French Annals.

23:59.720 --> 24:00.767
- Hello.
- Marx!

24:01.360 --> 24:02.521
Delighted.

24:03.040 --> 24:04.690
My wife, Jenny.

24:04.880 --> 24:06.564
- Delighted.
- Hello.

24:06.760 --> 24:09.161
Grün translates The Annals for me.

24:09.360 --> 24:10.964
He must betray them then.

24:12.200 --> 24:16.091
- You enjoy argument, young man.
- Contradiction, rather.

24:16.280 --> 24:19.762
- True, you're a Hegelian.
- A materialist above all.

24:20.880 --> 24:23.008
You didn't answer me about property.

24:23.200 --> 24:25.601
I defined it, I believe.

24:26.280 --> 24:29.250
And theft?
How do you define that?

24:29.440 --> 24:30.680
Do we need to?

24:30.880 --> 24:33.884
We all know it's the violation
of another's goods.

24:34.080 --> 24:36.606
- I'm sorry, my French...
- Your French is good.

24:36.800 --> 24:38.802
Thank you. So...

24:39.000 --> 24:41.731
property is the same thing?

24:42.200 --> 24:44.407
You say property is theft.

24:44.920 --> 24:48.527
When I steal someone's property,
what am I stealing from?

24:48.720 --> 24:49.767
Theft?

24:49.960 --> 24:52.804
You pretend not to understand,
I presume.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.161
Karl never pretends.

24:55.520 --> 24:58.922
He is saying
that your phrase is an image.

24:59.120 --> 25:01.646
A fine image, but, as you French say,

25:01.840 --> 25:03.968
an image chasing its own tail.

25:06.520 --> 25:10.570
You both speak truly excellent French.

25:11.400 --> 25:12.890
Don't they, Grün?

25:20.400 --> 25:24.610
Excellent news, my friends!
The Faubourg St-Antoine is in flames!

25:24.800 --> 25:26.290
What happened?

25:27.760 --> 25:30.081
It all began with one cobbler.

25:30.640 --> 25:33.689
He took a three-franc piece to his boss.

25:33.880 --> 25:37.851
The boss found it shabby
and offered him fifty sous.

25:38.640 --> 25:40.244
But the fellow refuses.

25:40.440 --> 25:42.249
The bastard throws him out.

25:42.440 --> 25:45.808
The cobbler returns with his comrades
to smash everything.

25:46.000 --> 25:50.085
Now the police, the league
and the National Guard are involved!

25:50.720 --> 25:51.846
It's a riot!

25:52.040 --> 25:56.250
Weitling, calm down.
The Faubourg riots every day.

25:56.440 --> 25:57.601
It's no revolution.

25:57.800 --> 25:59.962
No, but it's heating up.

26:01.080 --> 26:03.242
I'm looking for Arnold Ruge...

26:11.760 --> 26:14.081
He lives next door.
Take that door.

26:15.040 --> 26:17.202
You know there's a spy outside?

26:17.400 --> 26:19.402
- The man in the filthy scarf?
- Yes.

26:19.640 --> 26:21.449
Hard not to spot him.

26:27.560 --> 26:29.369
A compatriot of yours?

26:30.160 --> 26:31.764
You know that boy?

26:33.160 --> 26:34.160
No.

26:36.720 --> 26:39.200
What will you do
about the spy opposite?

26:40.160 --> 26:43.642
He notes entries and exits.
What can I do about it?

26:43.840 --> 26:46.207
I could go and beat him up.

26:46.400 --> 26:48.129
It wouldn't bother me.

26:48.320 --> 26:49.401
Certainly not!

26:50.000 --> 26:53.243
We're tolerated here,
but must not make waves.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.128
Shall I serve you too, darling?

26:59.320 --> 27:01.800
Just a finger, darling, just a finger.

27:06.120 --> 27:07.281
Excellent.

27:07.680 --> 27:09.330
Truly excellent.

27:09.920 --> 27:12.446
However, I can't pay you right away.

27:12.680 --> 27:15.001
- I'm sorry.
- I have enough to keep going.

27:15.200 --> 27:16.565
That's good.

27:16.760 --> 27:18.444
- May I?
- Of course.

27:18.680 --> 27:22.321
It's a pleasure working with you.
Unlike others.

27:22.560 --> 27:24.881
Who are you thinking of?
Feuerbach?

27:25.080 --> 27:26.080
Feuerbach?

27:26.720 --> 27:29.007
He owes me an article. No...

27:29.360 --> 27:30.360
Marx.

27:31.720 --> 27:33.006
Ah, him...

27:34.160 --> 27:35.889
Do you know him?

27:36.560 --> 27:38.767
We met in Berlin.

27:38.960 --> 27:41.247
Doing a paper with that fellow!

27:41.440 --> 27:44.046
- Impossible, isn't he?
- You said it!

27:44.240 --> 27:46.561
His articles are never ready.

27:46.760 --> 27:48.967
He always wants to improve them.

27:49.240 --> 27:51.288
The man is a lout too.

27:51.520 --> 27:54.729
To think I said
I'd put him and his wife up...

27:54.920 --> 27:57.844
His wife. My God, his wife!

27:58.040 --> 28:00.407
A fury or a fishwife?

28:01.720 --> 28:03.449
Who are you talking about?

28:06.680 --> 28:08.762
You know there's a spy outside?

28:08.960 --> 28:10.166
So it seems.

28:10.360 --> 28:12.249
Karl, allow me to introduce

28:12.440 --> 28:13.805
Friedrich Engels.

28:19.120 --> 28:21.009
Haven't we met before?

28:22.800 --> 28:24.086
My kitchen...

28:29.600 --> 28:30.726
Berlin!

28:32.280 --> 28:35.568
- At Bettina von Arnim's salon!
- Precisely.

28:36.840 --> 28:38.365
You were arrogant.

28:39.280 --> 28:41.362
- Perhaps. I was young.
- And rich.

28:42.600 --> 28:44.204
And you showed it.

28:44.400 --> 28:47.131
- I don't remember that.
- I do.

28:47.760 --> 28:50.331
You spoke
as if you invented Communism,

28:50.560 --> 28:53.882
with your officer's epaulettes
and gold buttons...

28:54.280 --> 28:55.281
It was risible!

28:55.520 --> 28:57.045
Why brood on the past?

28:57.240 --> 28:59.242
- Let's turn to the future.
- Indeed.

28:59.560 --> 29:01.324
You know why I'm here.

29:01.960 --> 29:03.849
I told you, my situation...

29:04.040 --> 29:05.201
Spare me that!

29:05.400 --> 29:08.210
I have a sick child
and a family to feed.

29:08.400 --> 29:10.084
You owe me for two articles.

29:10.280 --> 29:13.329
- Listen to me...
- And your railway shares?

29:13.880 --> 29:18.090
- The price has dropped.
- Too bad, sell at a loss!

29:18.280 --> 29:22.001
I gave you two fundamental articles,
pay what you owe me.

29:22.200 --> 29:23.565
Ruge, do you need a loan?

29:23.760 --> 29:26.240
- Who asked you?
- I spoke to Ruge.

29:26.440 --> 29:30.161
- I won't take a single sou from a...
- From a...?

29:30.360 --> 29:32.089
From some wealthy amateur

29:32.280 --> 29:36.126
who seeks amusement
by frequenting those worse off.

29:38.040 --> 29:40.884
Please... Wait here for me.

29:41.080 --> 29:44.289
- I'll see what I can find...
- Yes, do that.

30:00.080 --> 30:02.128
You seem to know me well.

30:02.560 --> 30:04.642
Have you read my writings?

30:06.520 --> 30:09.126
I've read yours.

30:09.800 --> 30:12.201
Notably your
Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right.

30:12.400 --> 30:13.606
I couldn't care less.

30:13.800 --> 30:14.881
Really?

30:31.840 --> 30:33.922
An 1839 Chablis...

30:34.400 --> 30:38.530
An excellent host, Ruge,
even if he doesn't pay...

30:39.200 --> 30:40.326
Right?

30:51.080 --> 30:54.163
I've never read anything so precise

30:54.360 --> 30:56.249
and also so gripping.

30:59.120 --> 31:02.363
You have put Hegelian dialectic
back on its feet.

31:02.920 --> 31:06.402
I'm 24.
You can't be much older...

31:07.560 --> 31:11.167
You're the greatest materialist thinker
of our times.

31:11.440 --> 31:13.727
You're a genius, my dear fellow.

31:15.640 --> 31:17.130
A genius.

31:22.560 --> 31:25.769
Your investigation
of the English proletariat...

31:27.240 --> 31:30.528
The Condition of the Working Class
in England? Yes.

31:31.400 --> 31:32.845
That's mine.

31:33.520 --> 31:35.329
May I be frank?

31:35.840 --> 31:37.285
Go ahead.

31:37.520 --> 31:39.124
I can take it.

31:41.280 --> 31:43.806
It's a first class piece of work.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.128
No one had done it before.

31:47.880 --> 31:48.961
In short...

31:50.000 --> 31:51.684
it's colossal.

31:56.880 --> 31:58.041
Karl...

32:03.600 --> 32:06.251
Better than your cheap muck, isn't it?

32:07.440 --> 32:08.680
It's different.

32:11.320 --> 32:14.847
Your knowledge of the workers' world
is unrivalled...

32:15.200 --> 32:18.682
Manchester, the slums, the factories...

32:19.640 --> 32:24.248
You know both the workers' misery
and upper spheres of the bourgeoisie.

32:24.440 --> 32:25.851
How do you do it?

32:28.280 --> 32:30.601
I'm ashamed to say it.

32:32.360 --> 32:34.044
I'm my father's signatory.

32:34.240 --> 32:36.971
He has three mills there
with a partner,

32:37.160 --> 32:39.128
and ten others in Barmen.

32:39.920 --> 32:41.968
All right, but the rest?

32:42.720 --> 32:44.882
- The workers' lives?
- Yes.

32:45.400 --> 32:47.050
That's something else.

32:48.160 --> 32:49.924
A love affair.

32:51.640 --> 32:53.369
Are your papers in order?

32:53.600 --> 32:55.284
I have my passport somewhere.

33:03.280 --> 33:04.850
Let's not risk it.

33:05.720 --> 33:08.769
They're edgy with foreigners,
especially Germans.

33:09.720 --> 33:11.245
Just follow me.

33:13.240 --> 33:14.446
Keep moving.

33:15.520 --> 33:17.921
At my signal, we turn right.

33:19.200 --> 33:20.200
Now!!

33:20.280 --> 33:22.408
Stop! Two men with me!

33:23.080 --> 33:25.560
- Leave it!
- It's an heirloom!

33:25.760 --> 33:26.807
Stop!

33:27.000 --> 33:28.331
I order you to stop!

33:28.560 --> 33:29.721
Stop!

33:51.880 --> 33:53.450
- Hello.
- What a nerve!

34:12.600 --> 34:13.886
Help!

34:14.239 --> 34:15.286
Help! The police!

34:15.960 --> 34:17.371
- Help!
- Out of the way!

34:57.800 --> 35:00.087
To return to your writings...

35:00.920 --> 35:02.001
What you lack...

35:02.200 --> 35:03.804
- If I may...
- Go on.

35:05.160 --> 35:06.446
Don't take it badly.

35:06.680 --> 35:10.048
Your critique of religion and idealism
will leave a mark.

35:10.240 --> 35:14.040
But read the English economists.
Ricardo. Smith.

35:14.240 --> 35:15.321
Bentham.

35:16.080 --> 35:18.003
They're the basis of everything.

35:19.280 --> 35:20.645
Do you read English?

35:21.760 --> 35:23.205
I'm a fast learner.

35:23.400 --> 35:24.640
Check.

35:29.560 --> 35:31.881
- Another? On me.
- All right.

35:32.080 --> 35:33.127
Waiter!

35:33.680 --> 35:34.727
Two more!

35:37.000 --> 35:38.000
Right...

35:39.080 --> 35:40.650
I have no choice.

35:42.800 --> 35:44.211
Checkmate.

35:47.000 --> 35:49.924
To minds that truly think
and to free spirits!

35:53.680 --> 35:54.761
Cheers.

35:57.240 --> 35:58.571
I didn't see it.

36:00.040 --> 36:01.040
Waiter!

36:05.440 --> 36:07.124
I've had it with Ruge.

36:07.800 --> 36:10.167
I'll give my writings to Vorwärts.

36:12.440 --> 36:14.522
I'm completely broke...

36:16.400 --> 36:17.890
So am I... Waiter!

36:18.080 --> 36:20.082
I'm serious, I need money.

36:20.720 --> 36:22.370
Have I mentioned my wife?

36:23.680 --> 36:24.920
Jenny?

36:25.120 --> 36:27.964
The prettiest aristocrat in Trier.

36:28.760 --> 36:30.364
She's a Westphalen,

36:30.680 --> 36:33.570
one of the country's oldest families...

36:34.240 --> 36:36.322
And who did she marry? Me.

36:40.120 --> 36:42.248
The son of a converted Jew.

36:49.840 --> 36:52.650
You've no idea
how happy she makes me.

36:54.760 --> 36:56.762
- You're a lucky man.
- Yes.

36:59.120 --> 37:00.451
And you?

37:04.240 --> 37:05.526
What?

37:05.720 --> 37:08.291
Didn't you mention
a love in your life?

37:09.680 --> 37:11.364
Complicated.

37:12.400 --> 37:14.129
Cheerio!

37:16.560 --> 37:17.686
All right, cheerio!

37:28.720 --> 37:29.720
Better?

37:34.320 --> 37:35.970
Not really.

37:37.880 --> 37:39.325
I'll see you home.

37:39.560 --> 37:40.641
No!

37:41.280 --> 37:42.361
I'll see you home.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.206
Here...

37:45.400 --> 37:46.561
Thank you.

37:53.120 --> 37:54.406
You know...

37:57.680 --> 37:59.887
I think I've understood something.

38:00.080 --> 38:01.570
Thanks to you.

38:03.440 --> 38:06.125
- You've made me realize something.
- You too.

38:06.320 --> 38:07.606
No, you.

38:09.920 --> 38:11.126
Listen.

38:12.240 --> 38:15.164
- Until now, philosophers...
- Ah, philosophers...

38:15.360 --> 38:17.169
- Listen to me.
- Let's go.

38:17.360 --> 38:19.601
Until now, philosophers

38:19.800 --> 38:21.962
have simply interpreted...

38:22.960 --> 38:25.088
Interpreted the world...

38:29.360 --> 38:31.362
Yet it must be transformed...

38:33.520 --> 38:35.124
But with what?

38:35.320 --> 38:36.320
With whom?

38:39.080 --> 38:40.080
Proudhon.

38:40.920 --> 38:42.251
He'll help us.

38:42.720 --> 38:44.085
Come on!

39:20.160 --> 39:21.161
Karl...

39:21.760 --> 39:23.524
Karl, where are you?

39:45.360 --> 39:46.885
Oh, God...

39:48.360 --> 39:50.124
God, my head.

40:16.920 --> 40:18.809
You're leaving already?

40:21.560 --> 40:23.881
Thank you for your hospitality.

40:24.240 --> 40:26.846
Your... generosity.

40:27.440 --> 40:30.762
- Matters to see to.
- Matters of the heart.

40:30.960 --> 40:34.169
- Don't forget our matter.
- How could I?

40:37.200 --> 40:39.362
We didn't just drink last night.

40:39.800 --> 40:41.404
We took notes.

40:41.640 --> 40:44.291
We're going to write a book together.

40:44.920 --> 40:46.684
A critique of Stirner, Bauer...

40:46.880 --> 40:49.247
Those sentimental Berlin Socialists.

40:49.840 --> 40:53.003
The writers of the so-called
Critical Critique.

40:53.200 --> 40:56.568
- We'll bring things to a head, Jenny...
- To a head?

40:57.040 --> 40:58.326
Sir...

40:59.120 --> 41:01.009
And the title?

41:01.200 --> 41:02.645
We're just starting...

41:03.320 --> 41:05.926
I imagine a title,

41:06.120 --> 41:07.645
looking at you both.

41:09.160 --> 41:12.130
Critique of Critical Critique.

41:23.560 --> 41:26.564
"The real price of everything..."

41:27.400 --> 41:32.281
Der wahre Preis...
"to the man who wants to acquire it,

41:32.520 --> 41:35.922
is the toil and the trouble."
Die Mühe und der Aufwand.

41:51.160 --> 41:53.686
To acquire: erwerben.

41:54.000 --> 41:58.562
To dispose and exchange it...

41:59.120 --> 42:02.329
it's the toil or trouble
which he can save himself

42:04.920 --> 42:07.924
and which he can impose
upon other people."

42:09.400 --> 42:13.291
"Labor was the first price,

42:16.600 --> 42:21.731
the original purchase money
that was paid for all things."

42:26.080 --> 42:29.004
You know, Karl has adopted you.

42:29.200 --> 42:31.362
He doesn't make friends easily.

42:31.920 --> 42:34.366
He never brought anyone home before.

42:34.920 --> 42:36.524
You're the first.

42:36.720 --> 42:39.291
Perhaps not a very good memory for you.

42:41.840 --> 42:43.808
I've read your essay.

42:44.320 --> 42:46.209
It sparkles like champagne.

42:46.400 --> 42:49.609
I can measure what you bring Karl.

42:50.440 --> 42:52.090
The thing is...

42:52.720 --> 42:56.611
Allow me to be frank.
He doesn't have your constitution.

42:57.160 --> 42:58.366
You're athletic.

42:58.600 --> 43:01.080
After drinking,
you're as fresh as a daisy,

43:01.280 --> 43:03.009
but he needs days to recover.

43:03.400 --> 43:08.247
So lead him wherever you like,
but please try to calm him.

43:10.280 --> 43:13.090
You're an extraordinary woman, Frau Marx.

43:14.400 --> 43:15.561
Jenny.

43:17.640 --> 43:19.324
You're admirable.

43:20.160 --> 43:22.970
You could have had a rich and idle life

43:23.240 --> 43:26.562
with a fellow aristocrat,
basking in luxury and envy.

43:26.760 --> 43:29.730
I escaped utter boredom, yes.

43:30.640 --> 43:32.529
Happiness requires rebellion.

43:32.720 --> 43:37.760
Rebellion against the establishment,
the old world. That's what I believe.

43:37.960 --> 43:41.282
And I hope to see
the old world crack soon.

43:42.640 --> 43:43.801
The two of us.

43:44.000 --> 43:45.126
No.

43:46.240 --> 43:48.208
The three of us, Jenny.

43:50.080 --> 43:52.048
We'll overthrow it...

43:53.120 --> 43:55.009
This old world.

43:57.320 --> 44:01.006
It might take more than three of us,
don't you think?

44:08.920 --> 44:13.050
My dear Marx,
as a filthy little peasant child,

44:13.880 --> 44:15.405
I hoed for potatoes,

44:15.720 --> 44:17.848
threshed wheat, kept cows...

44:19.040 --> 44:21.202
Sitting is agony for me.

44:22.320 --> 44:24.448
I'm doing it for you, Courbet.

44:24.760 --> 44:26.808
- Honored, Master.
- No master!

44:27.840 --> 44:29.365
You paint for the people

44:29.600 --> 44:33.002
and so I approve of you.
I abhor all other artists.

44:33.200 --> 44:36.124
So what of Raphael, Da Vinci,
Michelangelo?

44:36.320 --> 44:37.401
I reject them.

44:37.640 --> 44:41.008
Art in the future
will be collective, for the collective.

44:42.680 --> 44:45.889
Swapping bishops?
A risky strategy.

44:46.080 --> 44:47.525
Go on, swap them.

44:48.560 --> 44:50.005
My knight is trapped.

44:52.400 --> 44:55.449
- Another game.
- That move is infallible.

44:55.680 --> 44:58.445
There are no infallible moves
in chess, Dr. Marx.

44:58.680 --> 45:00.205
You're too sure of yourself.

45:00.400 --> 45:01.731
Enough of this!

45:01.920 --> 45:03.809
Sorry, I can't go on.

45:04.080 --> 45:06.651
You've met my friend,
Friedrich Engels.

45:08.640 --> 45:11.291
- We're writing about you, sir.
- Really?

45:11.520 --> 45:15.241
To defend you against German supporters
of Critical Critique, Bauer and so on...

45:15.720 --> 45:19.042
- Your friend Grün too.
- They attack me?

45:19.440 --> 45:21.920
- Violently.
- And you defend me?

45:22.120 --> 45:23.849
You? Defending someone?

45:24.040 --> 45:25.087
A low blow.

45:26.600 --> 45:28.568
I believe there are two men in you.

45:28.760 --> 45:32.401
The critical Proudhon,
thinking in abstract categories,

45:32.640 --> 45:35.689
and the real Proudhon,
who sees real poverty.

45:36.400 --> 45:39.051
- We defend the second.
- Against the first?

45:39.240 --> 45:40.240
No.

45:40.320 --> 45:41.845
For Critical Critique,

45:42.040 --> 45:45.726
owning and not owning,
stupidly called "having" and "non-having"

45:45.920 --> 45:47.365
are abstract ideas.

45:47.600 --> 45:51.207
Like you, we say to have nothing
is not an abstract notion,

45:51.400 --> 45:53.289
but a reality,

45:53.520 --> 45:55.522
an appalling reality.

45:55.720 --> 45:58.564
These days,
a man with nothing is nothing.

45:58.760 --> 46:00.762
Money creates his worth.

46:01.320 --> 46:05.609
That's why you were right
to analyze the economics behind that.

46:05.920 --> 46:08.969
Especially as no socialist writer
had done so.

46:09.160 --> 46:13.131
Your book is the French proletariat's
first scientific manifesto.

46:16.240 --> 46:17.651
Thank you.

46:17.840 --> 46:19.842
Let's drink to your work.

46:21.200 --> 46:22.247
Its title?

46:23.120 --> 46:24.610
The title?

46:26.280 --> 46:28.601
Critique of Critical Critique.

46:31.240 --> 46:32.605
Very amusing.

46:33.200 --> 46:35.680
It sounds very dialectical,

46:35.880 --> 46:37.245
very Hegelian.

47:26.040 --> 47:27.326
Assassination attempt!

47:27.560 --> 47:32.009
Three shots fired! Assassination attempt
on Friedrich Wilhelm IV!

47:32.880 --> 47:36.327
Assassination attempt
on the King of Prussia!

47:49.520 --> 47:51.010
The key point...

47:51.920 --> 47:53.843
is merchandise.

47:54.680 --> 47:55.920
Work,

47:56.120 --> 47:59.249
your work, can be seen as merchandise.

47:59.440 --> 48:01.807
Faubourg Saint-Antoine,
Craft workers' meeting

48:02.000 --> 48:05.004
Your labor is sold like merchandise
to your employer.

48:05.600 --> 48:08.001
Except that you're not free.

48:08.560 --> 48:10.927
You're forced to sell it to live.

48:11.120 --> 48:13.885
- It's killing us!
- And sell at a low price.

48:14.080 --> 48:17.402
- There'll always be bosses and workers.
- Not always!

48:17.640 --> 48:21.531
Saying "there'll always be"
is a bourgeois notion.

48:21.720 --> 48:24.121
Capital wants us to think that.

48:24.320 --> 48:26.243
But everything moves.

48:27.000 --> 48:30.209
Everything is subject to change.
Nothing lasts.

48:30.400 --> 48:34.883
All social relations -
slavery, serfdom, salaried work -

48:35.080 --> 48:37.242
are historical and transient.

48:38.360 --> 48:41.648
The truth is,
current conditions must change.

48:42.440 --> 48:45.683
The bourgeois is still free
to hire labor,

48:45.880 --> 48:47.803
the worker still forced to sell it.

48:48.000 --> 48:50.685
The bourgeois loves talking of liberty

48:50.880 --> 48:54.566
but that liberty is for him,
not for you, as you know.

48:54.760 --> 48:56.728
You sense it in your flesh

48:56.920 --> 48:59.048
each and every day!

49:01.720 --> 49:05.042
So the game is not a fair one.

49:06.640 --> 49:07.971
That is clear.

49:08.560 --> 49:09.891
It is rigged.

49:10.760 --> 49:14.003
What mistake
do reformers like Proudhon make

49:14.880 --> 49:19.169
in considering equal pay for all
the goal of social revolution?

49:19.920 --> 49:24.687
They dream of improving a system
that naturally produces poverty.

49:25.080 --> 49:26.809
Not of transforming it.

49:27.000 --> 49:28.968
- Proudhon is a great man!
- He is.

49:29.160 --> 49:31.731
No doubt about it. A great man.

49:32.280 --> 49:34.282
Not a great economist.

49:35.320 --> 49:39.120
He has his place in the vast movement
rising up in New York,

49:39.320 --> 49:42.244
represented here by Hermann Kriege...

49:46.080 --> 49:48.651
in Brussels, London, Geneva,

49:48.840 --> 49:51.605
even in Russia,
and above all in Germany,

49:51.880 --> 49:55.123
the homeland
of our famous friend Weitling!

49:58.680 --> 50:02.207
And where our sinister Friedrich Wilhelm
fell victim

50:02.400 --> 50:04.209
to an assassination attempt.

50:04.840 --> 50:07.081
That unfortunately failed.

50:07.280 --> 50:10.966
And also in England,
the home of my friend Engels...

50:14.600 --> 50:17.763
I'm proud to pass the floor to Weitling.

50:23.000 --> 50:25.128
You didn't pull your punches.

50:25.600 --> 50:27.967
My friends, this meeting...

50:28.160 --> 50:32.051
About the attack?
Sorry, I had no time to let you read it.

50:32.240 --> 50:36.325
I don't mind,
but the Prussian embassy won't like it.

50:36.560 --> 50:40.326
- I didn't write it for them.
- Just be careful.

50:41.000 --> 50:45.403
If anything happens to you,
I won't be here to defend you.

50:45.640 --> 50:49.440
different words
to get this feeling across.

50:49.880 --> 50:52.121
Your trunks are already packed?

50:52.600 --> 50:53.761
Yes.

50:54.320 --> 50:57.244
Tonight, I'm in London,
tomorrow Manchester.

50:57.440 --> 50:59.568
We'll miss you. Come here.

51:01.120 --> 51:02.849
I'm the one who'll suffer.

51:03.040 --> 51:05.407
What about your great love?

51:05.640 --> 51:07.404
If only it were that...

51:09.000 --> 51:11.048
Hurry back. We have work to do.

51:12.040 --> 51:15.681
Our hearts beat as one!

51:16.680 --> 51:19.206
In the bright sun filled with love!

51:19.880 --> 51:22.690
In the bright sun of revolt!

51:24.120 --> 51:25.120
Yes!

51:25.240 --> 51:27.811
My brothers, my friends...

51:28.000 --> 51:30.162
We are one!

51:30.840 --> 51:34.367
We are invincible!

52:01.440 --> 52:03.044
The first floor.

52:37.760 --> 52:38.760
Come!

52:39.440 --> 52:40.440
Come!

52:49.000 --> 52:50.000
Hurry!

52:57.520 --> 52:59.522
Mr. Karl Marx?

53:00.400 --> 53:01.401
Yes, that's me.

53:01.640 --> 53:03.927
On orders of Prime Minister Guizot,

53:04.120 --> 53:07.203
in the King's name,
you are expelled from France.

53:07.600 --> 53:09.682
The King of France or of Prussia?

53:09.880 --> 53:10.880
He's being witty.

53:11.600 --> 53:13.011
Leave within 24 hours.

53:13.200 --> 53:14.531
You must be joking!

53:15.240 --> 53:16.605
You think so?

53:19.280 --> 53:21.009
Your passports.

53:58.920 --> 54:00.843
Within 24 hours.

54:01.960 --> 54:03.928
To go where?

54:07.960 --> 54:09.769
Where?

54:24.680 --> 54:26.808
We have to sell everything.

54:28.160 --> 54:30.731
- In one day?
- We have no choice.

54:35.920 --> 54:38.969
They've all been expelled:
Bakunin, Hess...

54:39.440 --> 54:40.965
Even Ruge.

54:55.520 --> 54:57.124
My darling?

54:57.760 --> 54:59.444
Are you ill?

55:11.440 --> 55:12.566
I...

55:13.880 --> 55:15.370
I'm expecting again.

56:13.040 --> 56:14.963
Yes, Father?

56:15.280 --> 56:17.009
How are you?

56:17.560 --> 56:19.688
How are you?

56:19.880 --> 56:22.611
- I'm surviving.
- I call it "being useful".

56:22.960 --> 56:25.122
I pay you for it, rather well.

56:25.520 --> 56:28.763
Is there something you wanted to tell me?

56:33.120 --> 56:37.762
People in my London club, ask after you.
My friend Naylor often says,

56:38.000 --> 56:40.321
"What's young Freddie up to?"

56:40.560 --> 56:44.804
- I can't lie. What should I tell him?
- Whatever you like, Father.

56:46.160 --> 56:51.724
Tell him I go fox hunting, play cards
and work hard for you.

56:52.680 --> 56:54.728
What if he shows me that?

56:55.840 --> 56:59.242
What should I tell him?
That it's a work of religion?

57:02.760 --> 57:05.684
- It's not what you think.
- Don't play with me.

57:05.960 --> 57:09.726
It is not a satire on religion.
It's against the Young Hegelians,

57:09.920 --> 57:14.369
- a subversive group.
- You have no respect for anyone, or me,

57:14.760 --> 57:18.970
but don't treat me like an idiot.
As if you're against subversive groups.

57:19.760 --> 57:23.082
It was going to be called
"Critique of Critical Critique".

57:23.280 --> 57:25.726
Marx added The Holy Family
without asking.

57:25.960 --> 57:26.960
Marx!

57:27.000 --> 57:29.526
Your name linked to a Marx...

57:32.880 --> 57:35.531
May I ask you to give us a moment?

57:41.280 --> 57:43.123
You have fine friends.

57:43.920 --> 57:45.763
I have none better.

57:46.040 --> 57:48.930
- You've no idea of his worth.
- Don't provoke me!

57:52.520 --> 57:55.649
I respectfully ask you
not to judge me.

57:55.840 --> 57:59.526
Let's keep this professional.
I'm your signatory

57:59.800 --> 58:01.723
and you pay me as such.

58:01.960 --> 58:04.531
To do you a favor, remember.

58:05.400 --> 58:07.289
My patience has limits.

58:09.960 --> 58:13.521
As soon as I get back,
you start threatening me?

58:15.600 --> 58:17.170
I'm not threatening you.

58:17.920 --> 58:19.445
I'm warning you.

58:26.120 --> 58:29.567
Your brother and sister
are being confirmed next week.

58:30.680 --> 58:34.366
I presume you don't wish
to receive Communion,

58:35.520 --> 58:40.128
Father, why ask me a question
you already know the answer to?

58:42.400 --> 58:44.801
How did this demon get into you?

58:46.920 --> 58:49.651
We go to church, we go to work

58:50.200 --> 58:54.125
and you laze about in dens of evil,
with communists and loose women!

58:54.760 --> 58:57.331
I'm not done!
Where are you going?

59:04.400 --> 59:06.448
To get some fresh air.

59:07.600 --> 59:09.125
I'm suffocating.

59:10.040 --> 59:11.929
What do I tell your mother?

59:24.440 --> 59:27.046
Do you want a tube, sir?
For your cigars.

59:27.360 --> 59:29.283
For cigars?

59:29.920 --> 59:32.400
Nice work. How old are you?

59:32.680 --> 59:35.889
I don't know, sir.
Some say ten, some say eight.

59:36.960 --> 59:39.964
I'd say six at the most.
Thank you.

59:45.960 --> 59:47.041
Where are they?

59:47.720 --> 59:49.722
Hey, wait!

01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:08.604
It's you!

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:10.245
God!

01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:13.087
- It is you!
- It's me.

01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:23.923
Shorty, this is Frederic.
He's not a loan shark.

01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:26.248
Who is he?

01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:31.048
Well, when he isn't running around giving
money to little rascals,

01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:33.921
he's my man.

01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:37.203
- Lizzy, Frederic is back.
- Hello, Frederic.

01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:44.646
- Just off the boat, are you?
- I got in three days ago.

01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:47.006
Three days?

01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:51.289
And you only just come round?
You rotter.

01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:56.683
You don't know my dad...
Or rather, you do know my dad.

01:00:57.360 --> 01:00:59.442
He's a walking prison.

01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:02.327
- I only just broke out.
- It's a shame

01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:06.565
we don't have a pint of good beer
in the house to celebrate.

01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:10.686
Would you give Shorty another guinea?
He's deserved it.

01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:18.846
- Blooming heck!
- Now run along.

01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:21.561
- I want to be alone with my man.
- Thanks, sir!

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.764
You're welcome.

01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:58.121
How are things coming on here?
Any movement?

01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:04.924
Oh, it's not just movement, my darling.
I got you the meeting you wanted.

01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:10.966
The League of the Just
mean anything to you?

01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:13.849
Tell me.

01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:32.765
Brussels, Winter 1845

01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:01.409
You are banned
from all political activity here.

01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:03.685
I signed that, yes.

01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:11.131
Here you are.

01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:23.164
Can you read this?

01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:27.842
I have a family to feed.
I need this job.

01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:31.363
Sorry. The postal service
requires a legible hand.

01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:53.408
I'll take anything.

01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:55.290
Anything.

01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:20.209
How is she, Lenchen?

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:25.727
No, not yet, Herr Marx.

01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:35.250
Don't push yet...

01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:38.720
Stay calm. Now push... Push!

01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:04.648
Why wait? You can go to her.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:11.081
Jenny!

01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:23.920
It's a girl.

01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:26.281
Another?

01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:28.569
Is that all you can say?

01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:06.245
Hello, Laura.

01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:11.969
Can we call her Laura?

01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:14.125
If Lenchen agrees.

01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:15.606
Of course.

01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:18.206
Lenchen?

01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:23.042
A good job she's here, Karl.

01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:26.805
What would I have done without her?

01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:30.003
Lenchen, this is Laura.

01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:32.370
Do you like Laura?

01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:35.407
It's a very pretty name, sir.

01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:38.329
So Laura it is.

01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:56.924
My dear Karl,

01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:01.366
its especially horrible
being not only a bourgeois

01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:04.089
but also a manufacturer.

01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:08.171
A bourgeois actively intervening
against the proletariat.

01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:13.643
A few days at my father's
have forced me to face this horror.

01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:19.647
Pushing the communist cause,
while working in trade and industry...

01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:22.330
it's not right.

01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:26.048
I won't last much longer.

01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:45.764
My dear Friedrich,

01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:49.362
I sympathize with your dilemma.

01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:52.089
And I miss having you here.

01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:56.890
Here, material life is materially hard.

01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:01.728
I became a father again.

01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:07.166
Jenny has given me a beautiful Laura.

01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:14.647
While I can't feed my family,
I have a new book in mind.

01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:21.966
I believe it is important to assert
that materialism as we conceive it

01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:25.803
differs from bourgeois materialism

01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:28.890
by questing for a more humane society.

01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:34.327
Two days! That's all I'm asking...

01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:37.131
- It's always two days.
- You're tiring madam!

01:08:37.399 --> 01:08:39.528
- It'll be the bailiffs then!
- Get out!

01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:41.563
- Be gone!
- What is it?

01:08:43.279 --> 01:08:44.850
We want our money.

01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:46.404
They'll bleed us dry!

01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:49.965
Excuse me.

01:08:56.840 --> 01:08:58.001
Here.

01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:00.245
Is that right?

01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:03.241
Have a good day.

01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:05.924
Off you go now.

01:09:08.399 --> 01:09:10.004
By what miracle?

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:12.529
- Where were you?
- The post office.

01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:15.962
- You've found work?
- A money order, from Friedrich.

01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:19.130
- And fresh news?
- Live even!

01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:30.171
Jenny.

01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:31.961
Lenchen.

01:09:36.399 --> 01:09:38.243
I have to tell you...

01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:42.002
This isn't easy to say.

01:09:44.319 --> 01:09:48.006
You know Friedrich met
the League of the Just in London.

01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:51.327
- Yes. And?
- You know Weitling.

01:09:52.319 --> 01:09:53.924
The visionary tailor.

01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:57.090
Don't make fun, Jenny.
He's a leader.

01:09:57.280 --> 01:09:59.203
He helped found the League

01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:01.084
and make it stronger.

01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:04.045
- I know that.
- They believe in something.

01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:06.567
What they lack are sound ideas.

01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:08.764
That you can provide?

01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:13.727
And what does Friedrich say?

01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:24.204
He asks me to join him in London.

01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:26.607
To meet the League members.

01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:31.246
I see.

01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:35.362
And I look after the children
with Lenchen.

01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:36.806
That's all right.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.606
Herr Engels' money will tide us over.

01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:44.526
No.

01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:50.121
Friedrich can manage without me.

01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:53.846
- I'll stay.
- Come on, sit down.

01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:57.846
You're mad.

01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:00.049
It's a unique opportunity.

01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:02.004
And you'd miss it?

01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:05.804
It seems to be a powerful movement,

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:09.447
with branches in Switzerland,
Germany, so...

01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:14.330
If you can get elected
as the League's delegate,

01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:16.565
you won't be alone.

01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:19.930
Together, you can raise an army.

01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:23.648
It can grow
and become invincible over time.

01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:28.761
You have to go.

01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:37.288
The League of the Just...

01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:40.011
You big fool.

01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:43.209
Lenchen? Are you coming?

01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:50.365
Oh, Weitling the tailor!

01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:57.201
London, February 1846

01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:00.650
Over there. Come on!

01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:05.922
There she is.

01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:09.722
Quick! You're late.

01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:16.130
My friend, Karl. My wife, Mary.

01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:18.164
Your... wife?

01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:22.405
You are such a great man to Frederic,

01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:25.042
I imagined you'd be bigger.

01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:27.811
I'm only a man.
But I didn't expect...

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:32.005
Oh, no, you can skip the compliments.
Come on, this way.

01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:34.764
Let's go.

01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:50.440
Wait, don't think it's in the bag yet.

01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:54.321
They're a tough bunch of men.
They've been beaten up a lot.

01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:57.046
- They trust no one.
- They read it?

01:12:57.240 --> 01:13:01.086
That too. Be careful
with your "critical" thingamajigs.

01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:03.683
They don't go for it.

01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:07.162
Promising...

01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:11.203
Here are the men.

01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:15.286
Frederic, you've seen him before.
And this is Karl.

01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:17.882
Karl Marx.

01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:24.320
Sit down.

01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:36.683
For the League's purposes,
there are two kinds of men.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:40.561
Men who've been hardened
and forged by manual labor,

01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:45.330
and men who profit from the fruits
of that labor, the bourgeoisie.

01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:50.361
By the look at you lads,
you're not in the first group.

01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:53.691
- I described in my book...
- From the outside!

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:57.925
- Not from experience!
- Have you experienced poverty,

01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:01.164
- prison, persecution?
- Excuse me, but if

01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:06.846
you rule us out before we've said a word,
what's the point of your motto,

01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:10.761
- "All men are brothers"?
- It's an ideal. Our ideal.

01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:14.647
- It's what we're fighting for.
- It's our new Jerusalem

01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:16.649
God, what are we doing here?

01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:22.290
The League needs real men, not eggheads
trying to tell it what to do and think.

01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:25.808
Yes, but you want to spread your ideas,
don't you?

01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:30.131
So test us. And throw us out
if you think we are not useful.

01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:34.361
Did someone say "useful"? Marx?

01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:39.209
I knew
you'd been expelled from France too.

01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:40.447
Here you are.

01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:43.570
- I'm in Brussels for now.
- Brussels...

01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:46.240
I'm giving talks there this autumn.

01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:49.808
A step on this long road
leading to our one goal:

01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:52.769
the abolition of money.

01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:54.689
Let me look at you.

01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:56.325
You're thinner.

01:14:57.200 --> 01:14:59.407
You've suffered. Me too.

01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:02.202
I was shackled and beaten.

01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:05.006
Look what they did to me.

01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:11.609
But they couldn't break my soul.

01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:15.123
Weitling! This isn't one of your rallies.
Sit down.

01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:19.207
So. How can you be of use to us?

01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:23.245
Weitling has followers in
France and Switzerland,

01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:26.205
you have branches in Germany and England.

01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:29.927
With us, you will have
a bridgehead in Brussels...

01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:34.001
- Weitling's going there.
- I'm talking about a permanent link.

01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:38.002
About a web connection
all the way down to Paris, even Lyon.

01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:41.206
- Why Lyon?
- Because of Proudhon.

01:15:42.280 --> 01:15:44.521
Proudhon. You know Proudhon?

01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:46.643
Yes, I know him personally.

01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:48.406
We are very close.

01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:53.246
We met each other regularly
until he was deported.

01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:56.804
And we respect each other deeply.

01:15:57.760 --> 01:16:01.731
We're almost like you say in England...
hand in glove.

01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:06.649
Hand in glove?

01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:10.283
- Hand in glove.
- Yes, hand in glove.

01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:15.003
Come on!

01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:21.209
Naming Proudhon was daring.

01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:23.687
You turned your pawn into a queen.

01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:29.167
- Sorry, sir, but the lady is not...
- I know women aren't allowed in here,

01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:33.246
- but if my wife catches a cold outside...
- Sir.

01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:36.080
I will kick up such a fuss

01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:39.124
that you'll
never work anywhere, ever again.

01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:42.369
Don't, Frederic.
I don't belong here.

01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:46.889
Let's go somewhere else.
A pub will do for comparing notes. Come.

01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:54.889
- Well, it's young Engels!
- Oh, Mr. Naylor.

01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:56.930
How do you do?

01:16:57.160 --> 01:17:01.688
I often ask my good friend Engels
how young Friedrich's doing these days.

01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:04.850
- How is your father?
- As well as he can be.

01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:07.281
Please let me introduce my wife Mary.

01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:11.845
- How do you do?
- And my good friend Marx.

01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:15.283
- Nice to meet you.
- Mr. Naylor owns foundries in Leeds.

01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:19.925
He employs many workers, even children.
A harsh necessity.

01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:24.410
Marx is a journalist. He's researching
a topic we're interested in...

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.367
About child labor in factories.

01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:30.528
How many work in yours?

01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:33.371
It's about twenty children to thirty men.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:35.923
- Day or night work?
- Both.

01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:38.282
Isn't that exhausting?

01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:42.247
- Working at night has no effect on health.
- Your health.

01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:46.290
- I beg your pardon?
- My wife means

01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:51.049
it makes no difference to your health.
But to the children's...

01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:53.204
We have no choice.

01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:55.802
You know without child labor

01:17:56.080 --> 01:18:00.802
- we'd price ourselves out of the market.
- Meaning you'd have to pay fair wages?

01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:06.407
- The market sets the prices, young man.
- Of course.

01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:09.120
If I stopped hiring children,
others would.

01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:12.967
I'd go bankrupt.
That's what society does.

01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:16.922
No, sir. This is how existing
relations of production work.

01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:19.771
Not society. Society is not you.

01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:28.007
I don't know what you mean
by "relations of production".

01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:31.291
It all sounds Hebrew to me.

01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:35.008
Thank you, James.

01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:39.089
If labor costs more,
there'd be no more profits.

01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:44.123
Therefore no more economy,
therefore no more society.

01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:47.766
Perhaps that's what you want, eh?

01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:52.160
You're so right, we are not speaking
the same language.

01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:55.683
What you call profit,
I call exploitation.

01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:03.922
Mr. Engels, I've been very patient
in token of my friendship for your father

01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:08.524
And where would a society with no
exploitation leave people like you?

01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:12.167
You'd have to work too.
Wouldn't that be horrible?

01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:21.006
My regards to your father.

01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:32.329
My old man's going to kill me this time.

01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:41.325
Brussels, March 30th, 1846

01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:45.403
We're happy to welcome
eminent representatives

01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:47.006
of the workers' movement.

01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:50.727
You, Pavel Annenkov, welcome.

01:19:51.240 --> 01:19:52.810
You, Hermann Kriege.

01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:55.281
And, last but not least,

01:19:55.760 --> 01:19:59.367
our great and dear Weitling.

01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:01.284
Enough!

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:06.684
You know why we're here.

01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:08.723
We're going to agree

01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:11.207
on a simple common doctrine

01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:14.571
for the workers
who have no time to study.

01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:17.127
That won't be an easy thing to do.

01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:20.723
- It engages us fraternally.
- How fraternal of you!

01:20:20.920 --> 01:20:25.847
- Grün, be constructive.
- Certainly. I wouldn't be here otherwise.

01:20:26.040 --> 01:20:28.771
Unless you're here for something else.

01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:30.644
- Pardon me?
- You never know.

01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:31.921
Karl!

01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:34.243
I like this idea of simplicity.

01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:38.764
What unites us, my young companions,
is simple.

01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:43.364
- The people's happiness.
- Their happiness?

01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:47.806
That's all you can come up with
to justify your activities?

01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:49.371
Pardon me?

01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:54.403
Love, happiness,
the realm of Christ on Earth?

01:20:55.440 --> 01:21:00.207
I ask you, Weitling, given the fuss
you cause with your preaching,

01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:04.564
what true theoretical basis
justifies your activities,

01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:07.127
and what will their future basis be?

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:14.000
My goal...

01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:16.046
My intention...

01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:19.722
is not to create new theories,
economic or otherwise.

01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:23.842
I rise up
against the cult of novelty at any cost.

01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:29.365
I said it again yesterday.
I had a whole hall on its feet.

01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:32.291
All power to the workers

01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:35.530
to establish universal harmony...

01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:40.123
Just 100000 armed proletarians,

01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:45.328
backed up by 40000 criminals,
could bring down bourgeois tyranny.

01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:49.007
I say that stirring up the workers
without offering them

01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:53.001
a constructive doctrine
is a dishonest, pretentious game

01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:57.604
with an inspired prophet on one side
and gaping idiots on the other!

01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:00.650
My audience...

01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:02.890
Idiots?

01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:04.684
- Scandalous!
- Outrageous!

01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:08.851
We have a Russian among us. Pavel...

01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:12.843
You might have a role
in his country, Weitling.

01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:16.649
It's the only place
for vague alliances between

01:22:16.840 --> 01:22:18.968
vague prophets and disciples...

01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:21.291
But in our countries,

01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:23.887
in Germany, France or England,

01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:27.130
nothing can be done
without a positive theory.

01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:29.966
A man who leads hundreds to justice

01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:32.243
cannot be treated like this!

01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:34.886
A hypocrite like
you should keep silent.

01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:37.250
What did you call me?

01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:43.849
I've received thousands of letters
proving to me that my modest work

01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:49.127
does more for the cause than talk
cut off from the people's suffering.

01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:52.524
Ignorance never helped anyone!
Never!

01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:54.565
Karl, take that back!

01:22:54.840 --> 01:22:57.286
- I want an apology.
- What's wrong with you?

01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:02.248
- I won't stand for this.
- Please, be reasonable. Please!

01:23:16.440 --> 01:23:19.444
I'll be the first to be guillotined.

01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:22.968
Then the others, then your friends.

01:23:24.440 --> 01:23:27.250
And, finally, you'll behead yourself.

01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:39.451
Criticism

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.446
devours everything that exists.

01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:46.400
And when there is nothing left...

01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:49.124
it devours itself.

01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:53.249
Gentlemen, ladies...

01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:09.531
Thank you.

01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:33.850
What happened?

01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:35.610
What happened?

01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:38.724
Weren't you supposed to find
a common doctrine?

01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:42.041
With idiots like them?
Thank you.

01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:46.731
Look at me. Did you do it on purpose
or were you just in a bad mood?

01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:50.291
Either way, we're finished... Kaputt.

01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:53.561
Grün will report back to Proudhon.

01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:54.847
Always Proudhon!

01:24:55.040 --> 01:24:57.407
Can we stop bowing down to Proudhon?

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.765
Grün would have slandered us.
That's why he came!

01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:03.641
Maybe,
but Proudhon was our joker.

01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:06.921
The trump card in our strategy.

01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:10.727
- Can't you see I advanced it?
- How so?

01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:15.001
Can somebody tell me
what the fucking hell just happened?

01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:40.681
I don't know what stops me
from crushing you like bugs.

01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:44.883
You insulted one of our movement's
most respected men,

01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:48.002
you pretentious brats.

01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:50.607
Weitling is devastated.

01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:54.691
No one ever spoke to him like that,
not even his worst enemy.

01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:57.804
Perhaps the picture he painted
was too black...

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.526
What? Can you say that again?

01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:04.171
You dragged him through the mud.

01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:06.682
A man, a fighter, a leader...

01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:10.089
- May I...
- Despite his experience and maturity!

01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:12.807
Two qualities you are sorely lacking!

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.685
Your youth does not excuse everything.

01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:35.767
The League has reached a decision
concerning you.

01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:38.322
I'm here to inform you of it.

01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:41.807
It is a collective decision

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:43.843
and you will comply with it.

01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:50.766
"After careful consideration..."

01:26:52.920 --> 01:26:57.050
I repeat, "After careful consideration,
the London committee asks you:

01:26:57.240 --> 01:26:58.685
firstly,

01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:01.884
to formally join the League.

01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:06.321
Secondly...

01:27:07.160 --> 01:27:09.845
to work on its reorganization.

01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:11.361
And thirdly,

01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:15.286
to work on the drafting
of a new programme

01:27:15.520 --> 01:27:18.364
that will then be discussed
by all members.

01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:20.405
Have you understood?

01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:24.607
Obviously, as new members,

01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:28.131
you're invited to our autumn Congress.

01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:32.245
We hope to convince Joseph Proudhon
to attend it.

01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:35.610
We're counting on your help
as friends of his.

01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:38.925
Anything to add?

01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:41.281
Nothing.

01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:46.241
Nothing.

01:27:52.080 --> 01:27:53.366
Gentlemen.

01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:08.327
I can't return to Port-au-Prince
without the contract.

01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:09.607
Of course.

01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:11.325
Brussels, Bellevue Hotel, May 1846

01:28:11.560 --> 01:28:13.608
- Above all...
- I know what to say...

01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:22.691
Property will conquer the Republic
or the Republic will conquer property.

01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:36.801
Here he is!

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:38.809
Get rid of that cigar.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:40.081
Proudhon!

01:28:40.920 --> 01:28:43.321
My dear doctor...

01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:46.721
- You remember my friend Engels.
- Of course.

01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:48.809
Sorry, I have to change.

01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:53.848
I didn't understand your letter.
What was it about?

01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:55.810
Yes, later, Grün.

01:28:57.360 --> 01:29:00.921
It was about the League of the Just.
It's a powerful movement,

01:29:01.280 --> 01:29:03.328
with branches in the New World.

01:29:03.560 --> 01:29:05.289
What are you asking me?

01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:07.807
To be its correspondent in France.

01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:12.249
- The League's correspondent?
- Master, we must go.

01:29:12.440 --> 01:29:15.728
Stop calling me "Master"!
Let me breathe a little.

01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:21.688
A charming boy,
but he sticks to me like glue.

01:29:21.880 --> 01:29:26.010
You know he claims that he taught you
all about German philosophy?

01:29:28.200 --> 01:29:31.522
Well, he has a wife
and two children to feed.

01:29:31.720 --> 01:29:34.041
He has to impress people somehow.

01:29:35.640 --> 01:29:37.290
What were you asking me?

01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:40.687
To be the League's correspondent.

01:29:41.200 --> 01:29:43.202
I'll be frank with you.

01:29:43.640 --> 01:29:48.521
I have too much work and I'm too lazy
to take on additional obligations.

01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:51.523
You're younger than I am.

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.002
You don't have to answer now.

01:29:54.200 --> 01:29:59.047
- We'll gladly send you documents.
- No, my mind's made up. However...

01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:03.127
I'd like to pursue our discussions
by mail or otherwise.

01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:05.607
But, for God's sake, my dear Marx,

01:30:06.320 --> 01:30:10.120
let's not assassinate each other.
Let's avoid all insults.

01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:15.328
Do not be like Luther who,
after destroying Catholic dogma,

01:30:15.560 --> 01:30:18.245
founded an equally intolerant religion.

01:30:21.080 --> 01:30:22.969
Is that your last word?

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:25.729
Certainly not, my friend.

01:30:26.280 --> 01:30:27.850
Certainly not.

01:30:31.880 --> 01:30:34.451
Do we not have all history before us?

01:30:38.840 --> 01:30:40.046
Just a second.

01:30:49.400 --> 01:30:51.289
My latest work.

01:30:52.720 --> 01:30:53.767
Thank you.

01:30:55.040 --> 01:30:57.520
I'm eager to hear what you think.

01:31:00.120 --> 01:31:02.122
All my best to your family.

01:31:09.560 --> 01:31:11.801
The Philosophy of Poverty.

01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:21.130
This Congress...

01:31:21.760 --> 01:31:23.683
We must get it on our side.

01:31:24.680 --> 01:31:25.920
Yes.

01:31:27.520 --> 01:31:29.204
That's for sure.

01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:35.449
- But how?
- Let me handle it.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:42.365
And Proudhon?

01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:48.721
I presume I have to handle him.

01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:45.882
The Poverty of Philosophy.

01:32:46.080 --> 01:32:48.082
The Poverty of Philosophy.

01:32:48.680 --> 01:32:52.002
Have you read
Joseph Proudhon's Philosophy of Poverty?

01:32:52.200 --> 01:32:57.127
Here is Marx's answer,
The Poverty of Philosophy!

01:32:58.240 --> 01:33:00.561
London, Red Lions Hotel, November 1847

01:33:00.760 --> 01:33:04.242
Congress of the League of the Just

01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:09.567
and emissaries
from Uppsala and Stockholm are here.

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:14.766
- Soon we should have news from...
- Hello.

01:33:15.040 --> 01:33:18.601
Karl, may I introduce a few comrades?

01:33:18.800 --> 01:33:21.644
Wilhelm, Hans, Walter.

01:33:23.240 --> 01:33:26.164
- Very nice. Hermann.
- No news from Weitling.

01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:28.442
Hear that for Weitling?

01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:31.082
So, Gentlemen...

01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:34.570
- How are you?
- Fine. You have to talk to him.

01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:41.888
- Everything okay?
- Mr. Engels?

01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:44.242
Yes, that's me.

01:33:44.600 --> 01:33:47.080
I'm Donald Murray.
It's nice to meet you.

01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:49.681
I'm sorry but you can't speak today.

01:33:50.040 --> 01:33:53.089
You're not on the list
of official delegates.

01:33:53.440 --> 01:33:56.569
What do you mean, official?
We're League members.

01:33:56.920 --> 01:34:00.049
- We're de facto delegates.
- There can only be one delegate

01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:03.085
- and he must be accredited.
- Accredited?

01:34:03.320 --> 01:34:07.245
- But I am accredited.
- You're invited, not accredited.

01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:10.251
- You can watch, but you can't...
- No, no, no.

01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:13.091
We didn't come all this way
just to watch.

01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:16.922
- I demand a vote.
- You will lose.

01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:21.649
- You have too many adversaries.
- I have to be delegate, and that's that.

01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:32.806
For the Brussels delegation,
I've been requested...

01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:37.167
I call for a vote.

01:34:37.560 --> 01:34:39.403
- Why?
- Is that necessary?

01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:43.247
Who is against the accreditation
of citizen Friedrich Engels

01:34:43.640 --> 01:34:46.450
as the sole delegate
for the Brussels region?

01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:49.360
- We're in favor!
- We're not in favor!

01:34:49.720 --> 01:34:51.085
I'm against it!

01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:54.126
Who votes "no"? Raise your hands.

01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:01.682
And who's in favor?

01:35:04.760 --> 01:35:09.448
By a simple majority, Friedrich Engels
is accepted as Brussels representative.

01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:17.724
Go, Frederic, go!

01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:24.603
Thank you.

01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:28.887
On behalf of my friends in France,

01:35:30.040 --> 01:35:33.249
Germany, Switzerland and Belgium,

01:35:33.840 --> 01:35:36.810
I have come here to set out the principles

01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:41.526
on which we plan to base
the coming struggles...

01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:47.451
Let's not delude ourselves, these
struggles will be extremely violent...

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:51.288
Enough! Enough violence!
What we demand...

01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:55.962
What humanity demands
is kindness.

01:35:56.400 --> 01:35:59.006
- Quiet!
- Fraternity!

01:35:59.200 --> 01:36:04.286
What our world lacks and needs more than
our bodies need fresh water is gentleness.

01:36:04.840 --> 01:36:09.767
- A kind of ardent fraternity...
- Let him speak!

01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:12.287
Fraternity!

01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:16.446
There are probably some people here
who weep

01:36:16.680 --> 01:36:19.286
when they hear the words kindness,

01:36:20.120 --> 01:36:23.124
gentleness and fraternity.

01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:29.284
But tears do not give power.
Power does not shed tears.

01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:35.241
The bourgeoisie shows you no gentleness
and you won't conquer it with kindness.

01:36:35.960 --> 01:36:39.407
Citizens, friends, comrades,

01:36:40.440 --> 01:36:41.930
Why are we here?

01:36:42.520 --> 01:36:45.000
- Because we are fighting.
- Yes, of course!

01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:48.010
- Yes!
- What are we fighting for?

01:36:48.360 --> 01:36:51.125
Freedom!
- Equality! - All men are brothers!

01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:55.530
- All men are brothers.
- No!

01:36:56.080 --> 01:36:58.242
- All men are brothers.
- Yes!

01:37:00.280 --> 01:37:04.251
- You? And You?
- Yes, of course.

01:37:04.720 --> 01:37:07.246
What about you? Me?
All of them today?

01:37:08.840 --> 01:37:11.810
Are the bourgeois
and the workers brothers?

01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:15.722
- No!
- No, they are not.

01:37:18.280 --> 01:37:20.601
They are enemies!

01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:24.444
We need to know
what we have gathered here for.

01:37:24.840 --> 01:37:28.686
Is it for an abstract idea?
A sentimental day-dream?

01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:31.042
How far will that get us?

01:37:31.560 --> 01:37:35.326
We need to know what the League wants,
what it's fighting for, for what society.

01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:38.291
- And we have to decide that now.
- Why now?

01:37:38.520 --> 01:37:40.887
- Let him speak!
- We know who you represent.

01:37:41.080 --> 01:37:44.687
Marx is here, skulking in the crowd
after firing his darts.

01:37:45.080 --> 01:37:47.924
- Long live Weitling!
- Long live Proudhon!

01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:51.361
No, I'm here. I'm not sulking.

01:37:51.840 --> 01:37:54.844
You call:
Long live Proudhon and Weitling.

01:37:55.040 --> 01:37:57.088
- What's the point?
- Shut him up!

01:37:57.280 --> 01:38:00.409
- We heard you already.
- Proudhon won't leave France,

01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:04.122
And Weitling has given up!
You're cheering for shadows!

01:38:04.520 --> 01:38:06.887
All of you! All of you!

01:38:12.120 --> 01:38:16.170
I have here the book Marx is referring to.

01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:20.765
His answer to Proudhon.
He asks the fundamental question,

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:24.686
the question that sums up our struggle.
Karl!

01:38:25.720 --> 01:38:28.041
Go on, you have the floor.

01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:36.124
"The antagonism between the proletariat
and the bourgeoisie...

01:38:36.720 --> 01:38:40.042
can only lead to a complete revolution..."

01:38:40.360 --> 01:38:44.968
Shut him up!
"and as long as classes exist,

01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:50.128
the last word of social science will
always be, as George Sand said,

01:38:51.680 --> 01:38:54.126
the struggle or death.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.731
The bloody fight...

01:38:58.200 --> 01:39:00.123
Or nothingness."

01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:01.890
Long live George Sand!

01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:04.323
Long live Marx!

01:39:06.200 --> 01:39:09.841
Let those who refuse to fight
stand up and say so!

01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:14.851
The industrial revolution of today has
created the modern slave.

01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:17.681
This slave is the proletariat.

01:39:18.280 --> 01:39:22.001
By freeing itself,
it will free the whole of mankind.

01:39:22.680 --> 01:39:25.286
And that freedom has a name:

01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:30.686
Communism.

01:39:33.440 --> 01:39:37.764
That is why I propose
to abolish that motto

01:39:38.560 --> 01:39:40.847
because it's misleading and weak!

01:39:41.240 --> 01:39:43.004
This is a coup!

01:39:43.400 --> 01:39:45.926
Here is our motto!

01:39:46.200 --> 01:39:48.521
Workers of all countries unite!

01:39:49.720 --> 01:39:54.806
I request that the League of the Just
shall henceforth be called

01:39:55.120 --> 01:39:58.806
the Communist League!
Hands up those in favor!

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:10.209
And hands up those against.

01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:14.610
We are now called...

01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:18.646
the Communist League!

01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:25.330
Unbelievable!

01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:29.202
The Communist League

01:40:59.960 --> 01:41:04.409
Ostend, January 1848

01:41:26.440 --> 01:41:28.169
Come on!

01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:34.245
You got two beautiful children, Jenny.

01:41:38.600 --> 01:41:42.525
- Will you have any?
- Fred? A dad?

01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:47.442
No, his feet are too itchy.

01:41:48.840 --> 01:41:52.003
And having kids when you're poor,
is too much misery.

01:41:52.720 --> 01:41:54.802
- But Fred...
- I know.

01:41:55.840 --> 01:41:57.569
His money.

01:41:57.880 --> 01:42:00.042
His filthy money.

01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:03.724
No, I want to be free.

01:42:05.560 --> 01:42:08.245
I am free. I want to fight.

01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:11.451
And to fight, I have to stay poor.

01:42:12.240 --> 01:42:14.766
That's the way I see it.

01:42:16.040 --> 01:42:18.202
He understands me.

01:42:32.760 --> 01:42:35.331
So no children with him ever?

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.606
Maybe with Lizzy, later on.

01:42:44.840 --> 01:42:46.888
Who is Lizzy?

01:42:47.080 --> 01:42:49.321
My sister. She's 16.

01:42:49.760 --> 01:42:53.287
She could give him some.
Bless her heart, she's begging for it.

01:43:01.600 --> 01:43:04.331
Did I say something wrong?

01:43:16.720 --> 01:43:17.926
No time?

01:43:18.120 --> 01:43:21.169
You were due to deliver the programme
last week!

01:43:21.360 --> 01:43:24.125
I owe the New York Tribune
three articles.

01:43:24.320 --> 01:43:26.641
- I need money!
- The time is now!

01:43:26.840 --> 01:43:30.049
I have a family to feed,
a problem you don't know!

01:43:33.960 --> 01:43:35.450
You're unfair.

01:43:37.440 --> 01:43:39.442
Forgive me. What I mean is...

01:43:39.680 --> 01:43:42.729
I cannot depend on others
all my life.

01:43:42.920 --> 01:43:44.604
Not even on you.

01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:48.285
And I can't work from your notes.

01:43:48.520 --> 01:43:50.761
A communist catechism?
What is that?

01:43:50.960 --> 01:43:53.804
- It's what they asked for.
- Why? It's absurd.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.571
It's to help the workers remember it.

01:43:57.320 --> 01:43:59.527
It's useless.
It's totally boring!

01:43:59.720 --> 01:44:01.722
- I didn't say that.
- You did.

01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:04.211
Blame it on me.

01:44:05.160 --> 01:44:08.130
Just tell the committee
it's all my fault.

01:44:08.320 --> 01:44:11.130
- Is that how I work?
- I don't know.

01:44:11.400 --> 01:44:13.846
But they're losing faith in London.

01:44:15.720 --> 01:44:17.768
We have one final delivery date:

01:44:19.240 --> 01:44:20.366
February 1st.

01:44:22.600 --> 01:44:24.523
That's in five weeks.

01:44:26.080 --> 01:44:27.320
And otherwise?

01:44:28.200 --> 01:44:31.170
You must return
all documents provided and...

01:44:32.920 --> 01:44:35.400
measures will be taken against you.

01:44:41.560 --> 01:44:43.289
They can take them.

01:44:49.560 --> 01:44:51.005
I'm tired.

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:53.081
Tired?

01:44:54.080 --> 01:44:55.161
You?

01:44:57.680 --> 01:44:59.284
People are in an uproar.

01:44:59.880 --> 01:45:02.008
The price of bread is rising.

01:45:02.280 --> 01:45:05.284
The Irish famine has left
half a million dead.

01:45:05.520 --> 01:45:07.363
Unemployment is rising.

01:45:07.600 --> 01:45:10.649
Metternich in Austria
and Guizot in France will soon fall!

01:45:10.840 --> 01:45:12.524
Poland is ready!

01:45:12.720 --> 01:45:14.802
We're winning!

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.162
Rise up too! Wake up!

01:45:18.960 --> 01:45:20.769
I've never stopped.

01:45:22.080 --> 01:45:24.082
Not for one second.

01:45:25.600 --> 01:45:26.931
I'm nearly thirty.

01:45:27.120 --> 01:45:30.044
I have no more money,
no more energy.

01:45:30.600 --> 01:45:32.250
I want to write books.

01:45:34.760 --> 01:45:36.922
It's a time-consuming task.

01:45:39.360 --> 01:45:42.330
I'm sick of flyers,
manifestos, pamphlets...

01:45:42.560 --> 01:45:43.686
All right.

01:45:46.120 --> 01:45:48.043
You know as I do that...

01:45:48.720 --> 01:45:50.245
all this work,

01:45:50.440 --> 01:45:52.283
books, articles, talks,

01:45:52.520 --> 01:45:56.206
will have been to no avail
if we don't write a simple book

01:45:56.600 --> 01:45:58.841
that comprehensively sums it up.

01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:02.049
The Poverty of Philosophy.

01:46:02.240 --> 01:46:05.608
That was good, but we need
a communist manifesto!

01:46:06.240 --> 01:46:09.562
Proudhon will never rally.

01:46:09.760 --> 01:46:11.728
Weitling is finished..

01:46:13.400 --> 01:46:14.686
You want to stop?

01:46:15.960 --> 01:46:17.166
Really?

01:46:21.240 --> 01:46:23.049
You'll rest afterwards.

01:46:23.240 --> 01:46:25.402
I'll do the same. We'll rest.

01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:29.408
We'll be good bourgeois men.

01:46:29.640 --> 01:46:33.122
I in Barmen with my mother,
you in Trier with ten kids.

01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:35.560
Does that suit you?

01:46:41.920 --> 01:46:44.730
I thought you were serious for a second.

01:46:55.160 --> 01:46:56.969
Karl, what's this word?

01:46:58.080 --> 01:46:59.764
"Bogeyman".

01:47:00.360 --> 01:47:01.725
"Bogeyman".

01:47:02.360 --> 01:47:03.725
No, hold on.

01:47:08.720 --> 01:47:10.449
"A spectre...

01:47:11.600 --> 01:47:13.364
haunts Europe."

01:47:19.160 --> 01:47:20.764
"A spectre haunts Europe,

01:47:20.960 --> 01:47:22.962
the spectre of Communism.

01:47:23.160 --> 01:47:26.801
All the powers of old Europe..."

01:47:28.360 --> 01:47:34.083
"All the powers of old Europe..."

01:47:36.240 --> 01:47:39.084
Jenny, read it for him.

01:47:41.080 --> 01:47:46.644
"A spectre is haunting Europe,
the spectre of Communism.

01:47:47.440 --> 01:47:51.809
All the powers of old Europe
have entered into a holy alliance

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.002
to exorcize this spectre:

01:47:54.200 --> 01:47:55.645
Pope and Tsar,

01:47:55.840 --> 01:47:57.524
Metternich and Guizot,

01:47:57.720 --> 01:48:01.361
French Radicals
and German police-spies..."

01:48:06.200 --> 01:48:08.009
It doesn't make sense.

01:48:08.360 --> 01:48:10.681
- What doesn't?
- This part.

01:48:12.600 --> 01:48:14.329
There's a paragraph missing.

01:48:14.560 --> 01:48:17.450
Friedrich,
where's the central paragraph?

01:48:17.680 --> 01:48:19.125
Where is it? Quick!

01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:20.970
Don't pressure me.

01:48:22.520 --> 01:48:23.601
Here.

01:48:25.640 --> 01:48:29.087
"It is high time for communists
to publish

01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:31.601
their views, aims and tendencies

01:48:32.200 --> 01:48:36.205
and counter this tale
of the spectre of Communism

01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:38.448
with a party manifesto."

01:48:38.680 --> 01:48:40.284
Let me see.

01:48:45.400 --> 01:48:46.400
So...

01:48:46.600 --> 01:48:48.284
I would write:

01:48:49.880 --> 01:48:53.885
"to expose to the world at large

01:48:54.080 --> 01:48:57.687
their views, goals and tendencies."

01:49:04.040 --> 01:49:09.285
The history of hitherto existing societies
is the history of class struggles.

01:49:10.720 --> 01:49:14.202
Society is splitting
into two great hostile camps,

01:49:15.960 --> 01:49:19.203
into two great classes
that confront each other,

01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:24.043
Bourgeoisie and Proletariat.

01:49:28.200 --> 01:49:32.922
The bourgeoisie has resolved
personal worth into an exchange value,

01:49:33.280 --> 01:49:38.571
and, in place of indefeasible
chartered freedoms,

01:49:39.040 --> 01:49:43.568
has set up that single, unconscionable
freedom - Free Trade and profit.

01:49:44.720 --> 01:49:49.681
It has torn away from the family
its sentimental veil,

01:49:50.040 --> 01:49:53.362
and has reduced the family relation
to a mere money relation.

01:49:55.200 --> 01:49:59.000
It has drowned the heavenly ecstasies
of religious fervor,

01:50:00.320 --> 01:50:04.848
of philistine sentimentalism,
in the icy water of selfish calculation.

01:50:11.040 --> 01:50:14.726
Commercial crises,
by their periodical return,

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.924
put the existence
of bourgeois society in peril.

01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:22.647
The need of a constantly expanding market
for its products

01:50:22.960 --> 01:50:25.850
chases it over the entire
surface of the globe

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:30.129
A universal commercial bourgeois society
is born,

01:50:30.320 --> 01:50:34.291
with universal interdependence of nations.

01:50:39.840 --> 01:50:42.684
Modern bourgeois society
is like a sorcerer

01:50:42.880 --> 01:50:46.601
who can no longer control
the demons summoned by his spells.

01:50:46.800 --> 01:50:49.041
Manifesto of the Communist Party

01:50:49.240 --> 01:50:52.961
The weapons with which the bourgeoisie
felled feudalism

01:50:53.160 --> 01:50:56.209
are now turned
against the bourgeoisie itself.

01:51:05.680 --> 01:51:09.366
The 1848 revolution broke out
one month later.

01:51:11.520 --> 01:51:14.967
Class confrontation in Western Europe
overthrew the old regimes.

01:51:15.160 --> 01:51:18.926
The international workers' movements
arose from these ruins.

01:51:20.280 --> 01:51:25.411
The Communist Manifesto has being
translated and reprinted to this day.

01:51:26.720 --> 01:51:30.167
Exiled in England,
Supported by Jenny and Friedrich,

01:51:30.360 --> 01:51:34.251
Marx would keep writing
his key work Capital until his death.

01:51:35.640 --> 01:51:37.449
An open, immeasurable work,

01:51:37.680 --> 01:51:42.004
unfinished because the very object
of its critique is in perpetual motion.

01:57:06.760 --> 01:57:09.923
