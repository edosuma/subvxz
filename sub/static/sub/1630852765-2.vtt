I guess, technically,

Andy bailed!

08:40.240 --> 08:41.843
‐Yeah, but...

08:42.144 --> 08:43.781
he was right.

08:43.814 --> 08:45.250
These tables
are heavy AF.

08:46.052 --> 08:47.889
We could have
used his muscle.

08:47.922 --> 08:49.291
‐Muscle‐shmuscle.

08:49.324 --> 08:52.565
We did just fine
without his bonehead muscle.

08:52.598 --> 08:54.001
But, like,
not cool, bro.

08:55.805 --> 08:57.174
[Boy screaming]

08:57.207 --> 08:59.011
Andy, if you're
screwing with us,

kill you!

09:45.771 --> 09:48.744
Well, I guess we know
why Andy didn't show.

09:48.777 --> 09:50.246
‐Is that
Andy's clothes?

09:50.280 --> 09:51.616
And a skinbag?

09:51.917 --> 09:54.354
‐What am I actually
looking at here?

09:54.388 --> 09:56.660
I think
I'm gonna be sick.

09:56.927 --> 09:58.697
‐I mean,
I hated that guy

09:58.730 --> 10:01.268
but I didn't want him
to actually die.

10:02.003 --> 10:04.007
‐Remind me again
how being monster hunters

10:04.041 --> 10:06.813
is supposed to make

leap a few craters,

11:02.224 --> 11:03.894
Basic first date stuff.

11:04.494 --> 11:05.865
Right! Humans.

11:06.967 --> 11:08.737
I'm assuming
that human boys

11:08.770 --> 11:11.408
lack confidence just as much
as monster girls,

11:11.442 --> 11:12.812

‐[Giggling] Why are you
so into this stuff?

11:18.222 --> 11:20.059
‐Because

get to work.

11:25.203 --> 11:27.207
Yep, those are skinbags.

stop saying skinbags?

11:28.944 --> 11:29.779
‐No.
‐No.

11:29.812 --> 11:31.315
‐Okay, then.

11:31.348 --> 11:32.919
So, the monster's name
is Razor?

11:32.952 --> 11:33.987
That doesn't
sound safe.

11:34.021 --> 11:37.160
‐It's not. It refers
to its 23,371 teeth,

11:37.193 --> 11:38.329
which, coincidentally,

11:38.362 --> 11:39.866
is the monster part

11:39.899 --> 11:41.803
you need to retrieve
for the orb.

11:41.836 --> 11:42.972
So here's the deal
with Razor:

11:43.005 --> 11:45.978
it appears in human disguise
and always as a woman.

11:46.011 --> 11:48.115
But definitely
be on the lookout

11:48.149 --> 11:49.484
for women
you do not recognize

11:49.519 --> 11:51.488
and trust no one.

11:51.523 --> 11:53.392
‐Great,
I trust everyone!

11:53.426 --> 11:55.463
‐Razor only feeds off
testosterone.

11:55.496 --> 11:57.067
She needs it
to live.

11:57.100 --> 11:59.071
And she likes it
young.

11:59.104 --> 12:01.475
And Razor is also
virtually impossible to track

12:01.509 --> 12:02.812
because your
detector powers

12:02.845 --> 12:05.851
only work when she takes off
the disguise to kill,

12:05.884 --> 12:08.356
which means by the time
you get there, it's too late.

12:08.389 --> 12:09.759
‐Oh, Andy!

12:09.792 --> 12:11.529
We both had a quick jolt
of our sensors

12:11.563 --> 12:12.798

find her?

need this.

a flame thrower?
