"And so, the wicked
witch told the little girl,

01:10.026 --> 01:11.525
Come with me.

01:11.549 --> 01:13.092
I will take you to a place

01:13.116 --> 01:16.095
where rainbows spring right up
from the ground,

01:16.119 --> 01:18.358
where unicorns dance
in the fields,

01:18.382 --> 01:20.143
where trees grow cupcakes,

01:20.167 --> 01:22.449
the flowers blossom
with candy canes,

01:22.473 --> 01:24.582
and where it never rains.

01:24.606 --> 01:27.411
And there I will
cast a spell on you

01:27.435 --> 01:29.717
so that can sleep here
in happiness

01:29.741 --> 01:31.787
forever and ever."

01:57.552 --> 01:59.225
Seth?

01:59.249 --> 02:00.381
Boo!

02:02.383 --> 02:04.535
I got you.
Seth, that's not funny.

02:04.559 --> 02:06.754
I know. It was hysterical.

02:06.778 --> 02:08.887
No, the only thing
that's gonna be hysterical

02:08.911 --> 02:10.845
is how long you're grounded

02:10.869 --> 02:13.674
if I tell your mom you were
running around past bedtime.

02:13.698 --> 02:16.547
To bed. Now.

02:16.571 --> 02:18.984
Oh, man, what a buzzkill.

02:19.008 --> 02:21.769
I miss Jamie.
She was a cool babysitter.

02:21.793 --> 02:22.857
Hey, look.

02:22.881 --> 02:24.598
If you go to bed now,

02:24.622 --> 02:26.339
I'll make you chocolate-chip
pancakes for breakfast.

02:26.363 --> 02:27.775
Really?

02:27.799 --> 02:30.038
Swear on my sorority.
Sweet!

02:30.062 --> 02:31.953
Now, goodnight.

02:31.977 --> 02:33.065
Goodnight.

02:45.121 --> 02:47.273
Can you just hurry up, please?

02:47.297 --> 02:49.734
I've ordered pizza for us
on Mrs. Gibson's credit card.

02:52.346 --> 02:54.933
So what?
I haven't eaten all day.

02:54.957 --> 02:58.656
So, as far as I'm concerned,
pizza is an emergency.

03:02.182 --> 03:03.811
What?

03:03.835 --> 03:06.055
Of course, I'm wearing clothes.

03:08.275 --> 03:09.928
What color are they?

03:11.495 --> 03:13.169
Well, I guess,
if you don't hurry up,

03:13.193 --> 03:15.020
you may never find out.

03:17.632 --> 03:20.698
Yes. Make sure you come
through the garage.

03:20.722 --> 03:23.377
They have those little cameras
above the front and back doors.

03:24.421 --> 03:25.746
Okay.

03:25.770 --> 03:26.728
Hurry.

03:33.778 --> 03:35.127
Seth?

03:38.305 --> 03:40.065
Seth, you better not
try to scare me

03:40.089 --> 03:41.873
with that ridiculous mask again.

03:45.399 --> 03:47.681
I swear, if you're down here,
all you're getting tomorrow

03:47.705 --> 03:49.577
is leftover pizza crust.

03:54.277 --> 03:56.777
Hey. Everything okay?

03:56.801 --> 03:59.127
Claire, did you invite

03:59.151 --> 04:00.520
someone over this evening?

04:00.544 --> 04:03.175
No, of course not.

04:03.199 --> 04:05.917
I mean, I did order some pizza
'cause I was starving.

04:05.941 --> 04:08.224
He'll be dropping by soon
in case you're still

04:08.248 --> 04:11.314
awake and... watching.

04:11.338 --> 04:12.358
No.

04:12.382 --> 04:14.317
Claire, I am asking

04:14.341 --> 04:16.406
because I am pretty sure

04:16.430 --> 04:18.538
I just saw someone peeking
around the master's bedroom.

04:18.562 --> 04:20.584
Huh?

04:20.608 --> 04:22.542
I mean, at first,
I thought it was you,

04:22.566 --> 04:24.675
but it looked like they were
wearing one of Seth's mask.

04:24.699 --> 04:26.329
You weren't just playing
with him just now, were you?

04:26.353 --> 04:28.026
No.

04:28.050 --> 04:29.897
Well, I mean, are you sure
it wasn't Seth?

04:29.921 --> 04:31.508
He was wearing it earlier.

04:31.532 --> 04:33.161
I, uh, I guess it could be.

04:33.185 --> 04:35.990
But it, it looked
like he's still in bed.

04:36.014 --> 04:37.992
Really?
I mean, I can't see his face.

04:38.016 --> 04:40.386
So I can't say for sure.

04:40.410 --> 04:42.562
And he had stuffed his pillows
under the sheets

04:42.586 --> 04:43.998
to fake us out.

04:44.022 --> 04:45.850
So, maybe...
Oh.

04:47.374 --> 04:49.700
Well, I'm sure it's just him.

04:49.724 --> 04:51.789
I'll go check on them.
Okay, thanks.

04:51.813 --> 04:54.182
And, Claire, please call me
back immediately

04:54.206 --> 04:55.488
and let me know.

04:55.512 --> 04:56.861
Yeah, sure.

05:57.095 --> 05:59.247
Seth, did you take that mask

05:59.271 --> 06:00.814
and go into your sister's room
wearing it?

06:02.187 --> 06:04.078
Seth, you better not be
faking it.

06:08.846 --> 06:10.544
Must be the pizza guy.

07:02.247 --> 07:05.294
I really did try
to fight a good fight here.

07:06.251 --> 07:08.752
Thanks.

07:08.776 --> 07:11.798
But, ultimately,
it wasn't my call.

07:11.822 --> 07:14.148
The board disagrees.

07:14.172 --> 07:17.500
But they did say
if the father presses charges,

07:17.524 --> 07:19.502
they will allow me
to write a statement

07:19.526 --> 07:22.311
about your bedside manner
here at the hospital.

07:26.097 --> 07:30.600
I'm sorry, I have
a 12:30 appointment.

07:30.624 --> 07:33.124
You can leave your
badge with Kaci.

07:33.148 --> 07:35.300
But take your time.

07:35.324 --> 07:36.823
All right?

07:44.812 --> 07:46.746
Daphne,

07:46.770 --> 07:49.207
if you ever
need a recommendation...

07:50.687 --> 07:52.384
Thanks, Judith.
Yeah.

08:01.655 --> 08:03.371
Hey, how'd it go?

08:03.395 --> 08:05.112
Just don't, Jeremy.
Hey!

08:05.136 --> 08:06.486
Hey, hey.

08:08.052 --> 08:09.987
I did everything that I could.

08:10.011 --> 08:11.379
Except for telling them
who's really responsible

08:11.403 --> 08:12.380
for what happened.

08:12.404 --> 08:14.905
Daphne...

08:14.929 --> 08:17.473
You know how long Mixer's
been at this hospital.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.213
He's not going anywhere
anytime soon.

08:19.237 --> 08:20.998
The board practically
worships him.

08:21.022 --> 08:22.303
Yeah, well, now when everyone
lets him get away

08:22.327 --> 08:24.088
with the crap he pulls,
he won't.

08:24.112 --> 08:25.959
I told him
you've never overlooked

08:25.983 --> 08:28.788
caring for a patient before.
Not once.

08:28.812 --> 08:30.616
And what did you tell them about
this time?

08:30.640 --> 08:32.530
Daph...

08:32.554 --> 08:35.099
it was your responsibility
to check his vitals

08:35.123 --> 08:37.971
regardless of what Mixer had
asked you to do.

08:37.995 --> 08:40.017
But I did tell them that you
were just trying to do your job

08:40.041 --> 08:41.888
to the best of your ability

08:41.912 --> 08:43.586
regardless of what happened.

08:43.610 --> 08:45.786
Except, you didn't tell them
he wasn't doing his.

08:48.092 --> 08:50.070
Oh, and by the way,

08:50.094 --> 08:52.377
remember on our second date when
I said I knew I was gonna regret

08:52.401 --> 08:54.074
dating a physician's assistant?

08:54.098 --> 08:55.926
I was right.

08:56.797 --> 08:57.885
We're done.

08:58.668 --> 08:59.626
Daphne!

09:00.583 --> 09:01.671
Daphne!

09:05.196 --> 09:07.000
You know what?

09:07.024 --> 09:08.654
I'm gonna tell the board
what I know

09:08.678 --> 09:10.787
about him and Kim in post op.

09:10.811 --> 09:12.179
Kaci, no.
What?

09:12.203 --> 09:13.441
Don't do that.
Why?

09:13.465 --> 09:15.182
It doesn't matter.

09:15.206 --> 09:16.967
And I honestly don't even
think they'd care.

09:16.991 --> 09:19.186
So what?

09:19.210 --> 09:22.320
You're just gonna walk away
from this without a fight?

09:22.344 --> 09:25.845
Daphne, come on, girl...
Kaci, it doesn't matter.

09:25.869 --> 09:28.631
That little boy is gone forever.

09:28.655 --> 09:30.676
And regardless
of who's at fault,

09:30.700 --> 09:32.460
I played a part in that.

09:32.484 --> 09:35.009
I know. I know. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. Come here.

09:36.184 --> 09:37.272
It's okay.

09:40.884 --> 09:42.016
Daphne.

09:44.627 --> 09:47.084
Hey. I just want to say
I heard what happened.

09:47.108 --> 09:48.999
I am so sorry.

09:49.023 --> 09:51.044
Oh, I bet you are.

09:51.068 --> 09:52.742
Excuse me, Ms. Washington,

09:52.766 --> 09:54.700
I was speaking with Nurse Hart.

09:54.724 --> 09:56.030
I know.

09:57.553 --> 10:01.272
Daphne, I really am sorry.

10:01.296 --> 10:03.448
They made the wrong call
letting you go, you know?

10:03.472 --> 10:05.929
No one could've known.

10:05.953 --> 10:08.627
And who knows if it would've
changed anything

10:08.651 --> 10:10.150
even if you had been there.

10:10.174 --> 10:12.022
Okay, I'm gonna stop you
right there

10:12.046 --> 10:14.677
because somebody absolutely
could have known.

10:14.701 --> 10:16.635
You just didn't care enough to.

10:16.659 --> 10:17.617
Mm-hm.

10:35.722 --> 10:37.047
But dad does wanna see her.

10:37.071 --> 10:38.570
There's not much I can do
about that.

10:38.594 --> 10:40.703
Hey!
Hey!

10:40.727 --> 10:42.530
Uh, Mom, look.
Kaci just got here.

10:42.554 --> 10:44.382
So, can I call you tomorrow?

10:45.688 --> 10:47.429
I love you, too. Okay. Bye.

10:48.865 --> 10:50.713
Hi.
So, I have some...

10:50.737 --> 10:52.105
...fantastic news.

10:52.129 --> 10:53.827
Oh. Okay.

10:55.393 --> 10:56.719
I've got you covered, girl.

10:56.743 --> 10:57.676
What are you talking about?

10:57.700 --> 10:59.417
Dr. Burke

10:59.441 --> 11:02.115
had a friend stop by
for a scrip yesterday.

11:02.139 --> 11:04.770
Oh, it was this gorgeous
cosmetic surgeon

11:04.794 --> 11:07.207
that she went
to medical school with

11:07.231 --> 11:08.992
and now she owns her own
practice in Beverly Hills,

11:09.016 --> 11:10.254
but anyway...

11:10.278 --> 11:12.038
She has a kid,

11:12.062 --> 11:13.779
this cute little boy.

11:13.803 --> 11:16.173
And I heard her
talk on the phone

11:16.197 --> 11:18.654
saying something about
she needs a babysitter

11:18.678 --> 11:20.264
this weekend, last minute,

11:20.288 --> 11:22.725
and I kind of mentioned you.

11:24.118 --> 11:26.052
Mentioned me for what?

11:26.076 --> 11:28.011
To help babysit.

11:28.035 --> 11:30.404
Kaci, I'm not a babysitter.

11:30.428 --> 11:32.015
I need to focus on getting
a real job right now,

11:32.039 --> 11:33.451
like, as soon as possible.

11:33.475 --> 11:34.887
Right, right. I know.

11:34.911 --> 11:38.674
But, look,
this little boy has diabetes.

11:38.698 --> 11:43.200
Hold on. She wants to hire a
nurse as a full-time babysitter?

11:43.224 --> 11:45.028
Isn't that kinda silly?

11:45.052 --> 11:47.291
Okay. I'm just sayin'.

11:47.315 --> 11:51.406
You know, it's not only
$300 per day...

11:52.712 --> 11:55.647
but it's also a short-term gig.

11:55.671 --> 11:58.650
So, you know,
just think about it, I guess.

11:59.719 --> 12:01.348
Three hundred a day?

12:01.372 --> 12:03.437
Three hundred a day.

12:03.461 --> 12:05.178
I guess the grandma used
to help out with the kid,

12:05.202 --> 12:07.137
but, apparently, they are going

12:07.161 --> 12:10.880
to a wake in Sacramento
this weekend.

12:10.904 --> 12:13.534
So, I guess it's kind
of an emergency.

12:13.558 --> 12:15.275
Why isn't the kid going
with them?

12:15.299 --> 12:17.562
Apparently, he's
afraid of flying.

12:21.436 --> 12:25.329
I don't think I'm ready, Kaci.
Ready for what?

12:25.353 --> 12:27.723
To be left responsible
for another kid's life.

12:27.747 --> 12:29.072
After everything that happened,
it's just not...

12:29.096 --> 12:30.619
Daphne, listen.

12:31.838 --> 12:34.425
You did nothing wrong.

12:34.449 --> 12:35.948
Okay?

12:35.972 --> 12:38.081
You were following
doctor's orders.

12:38.105 --> 12:40.431
The wrong orders.
Yeah.

12:40.455 --> 12:44.000
And you will never go against
your better instincts again.

12:44.024 --> 12:46.219
Will you?
No, of course not.

12:46.243 --> 12:47.438
Okay, then.

12:47.462 --> 12:49.832
So, who better

12:49.856 --> 12:52.008
to take care of that kid

12:52.032 --> 12:54.097
than the best children's nurse

12:54.121 --> 12:56.839
I have ever met in my life?

12:56.863 --> 12:58.797
Can I just think about it?

12:58.821 --> 13:00.277
And I'll get back to you
tonight?

13:00.301 --> 13:01.781
Okay. Sure.

13:10.964 --> 13:12.269
Okay...

13:19.973 --> 13:22.429
I hope you're calling to tell me
you changed your mind.

13:22.453 --> 13:26.346
Well, I didn't change my mind
about making a bad call,

13:26.370 --> 13:29.088
but I do know that there's
nothing I'd rather be doing

13:29.112 --> 13:31.003
than taking care of these kids.

13:31.027 --> 13:33.876
Mm. See, that's the spirit.

13:33.900 --> 13:35.616
Can you send me their info?

13:35.640 --> 13:37.183
Yeah, sure.

13:37.207 --> 13:39.055
Hopefully, they haven't
found anyone else.

13:39.079 --> 13:42.406
Great.
Thank you, Kaci, really.

13:42.430 --> 13:43.886
I'll text you right now.
Okay.

13:43.910 --> 13:45.172
All right, bye.

13:46.913 --> 13:48.716
"818..."

14:37.572 --> 14:39.376
Hey, pretty girl.

14:39.400 --> 14:41.508
Hi... Oh, I know, I know.

14:41.532 --> 14:43.510
Don't cry. Don't cry.

14:43.534 --> 14:45.686
It's okay. It's okay.

14:45.710 --> 14:47.906
Hi. Shh.

14:47.930 --> 14:48.888
Come on.

14:51.151 --> 14:52.780
It's okay.

14:52.804 --> 14:55.087
Here we go.

14:55.111 --> 14:56.654
Here we go.

14:56.678 --> 14:57.809
Ah.

15:03.685 --> 15:04.904
Shh.

15:22.312 --> 15:26.031
Hey, Glenn. Um...

15:26.055 --> 15:28.207
Can you listen to the nursery
for a minute?

15:28.231 --> 15:29.774
I gotta go to the ladies'.

15:29.798 --> 15:31.582
Of course.
Okay, thanks.

15:54.692 --> 15:55.824
Hello?

16:10.926 --> 16:12.382
Thanks.

16:12.406 --> 16:13.973
No problem.

16:17.454 --> 16:20.153
Long night, huh?
Mm, they always are.

16:45.743 --> 16:47.243
Hi.

16:47.267 --> 16:49.767
Hi. You must be Daphne Hart.

16:49.791 --> 16:51.377
Yes.
I'm Karen Andrews.

16:51.401 --> 16:53.466
This is my son, Toby.

16:53.490 --> 16:55.077
Oh, hi, Toby, nice to meet you.

16:55.101 --> 16:56.904
Nice to meet you.

16:56.928 --> 16:58.210
Where did you
say you live again?

16:58.234 --> 16:59.603
Ah, just up the way
on Lankershim.

16:59.627 --> 17:00.821
Oh, nice.

17:00.845 --> 17:02.649
I used to live up here

17:02.673 --> 17:04.521
for a bit
after I graduated med school.

17:04.545 --> 17:06.566
Where did you go to med school?
Calumet.

17:06.589 --> 17:08.133
I'm sure you've never
heard of it.

17:08.156 --> 17:09.134
Yeah, no, never heard of that.

17:09.157 --> 17:11.180
How about you?

17:11.204 --> 17:12.920
Um, I went to nursing school
in Atlanta,

17:12.944 --> 17:14.357
'cause that's where
my family's from.

17:14.381 --> 17:16.532
Really? So, what brought you
out here?

17:16.557 --> 17:17.882
A boy.

17:17.906 --> 17:19.536
But that is a quick

17:19.560 --> 17:20.753
and an eventful story.

17:20.778 --> 17:22.233
Um...

17:22.258 --> 17:25.454
Yeah, I should've
stuck to med school,

17:25.479 --> 17:27.761
become a doctor
like I had originally planned.

17:27.785 --> 17:29.502
It sounds more
like a Cabernet story

17:29.526 --> 17:31.113
if you ask me.

17:31.137 --> 17:33.071
Yeah, probably.

17:33.095 --> 17:34.899
So, full disclosure.

17:34.923 --> 17:38.337
Um... Kaci, your friend,
told me

17:38.361 --> 17:39.860
about what happened.

17:39.884 --> 17:41.906
So, I can only imagine

17:41.930 --> 17:44.126
what you're going through
right now.

17:44.150 --> 17:48.478
But I also talked to my very
dear long-time friend Shannon,

17:48.502 --> 17:50.349
who you probably know
as Dr. Burke,

17:50.373 --> 17:53.222
and... Daphne, she had nothing

17:53.246 --> 17:56.225
but great things
to say about you.

17:56.249 --> 17:57.617
Thank you.

17:57.641 --> 18:00.490
Yeah, it's been a tough week.

18:00.514 --> 18:02.622
It's been a tough
week for me, too.

18:02.646 --> 18:05.060
I was nearly forced
to fly on a plane.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.452
Oh.

18:06.476 --> 18:08.391
But things are looking up.

18:11.177 --> 18:13.938
I'm good with water.
Thank you.

18:13.962 --> 18:15.722
Is that a birthday cake
milkshake?

18:15.746 --> 18:18.334
Yup.
That is my favorite.

18:18.358 --> 18:19.944
Really? Mine, too.

18:19.968 --> 18:21.772
Really?

18:21.796 --> 18:25.863
I assume that Kaci filled you in
on everything.

18:25.887 --> 18:29.649
Yes, um, she told me that
you guys were going out of town,

18:29.673 --> 18:33.653
and that Mr. Toby here has
a pesky case of insulin fever.

18:33.677 --> 18:35.133
This is my cheat day.

18:35.157 --> 18:37.464
So the next six days are
gonna be brutal.

18:39.161 --> 18:40.617
Do you have
any other questions for me?

18:40.641 --> 18:42.619
Or for either of us?
I don't think so.

18:42.643 --> 18:44.273
I think I just thought
you would be interviewing me.

18:44.297 --> 18:45.665
So I didn't...
Yeah.

18:45.689 --> 18:46.797
You know,
Shannon told me everything

18:46.821 --> 18:48.190
I need to know.

18:48.214 --> 18:49.191
Well, actually, no...
Yeah, uh...

18:49.215 --> 18:50.627
When are you coming back?

18:50.651 --> 18:52.063
We're gonna head back
on Sunday evening.

18:52.087 --> 18:53.586
We should be back around 9:00.

18:53.610 --> 18:55.936
A-again, I'm sorry
for your loss.

18:55.960 --> 18:57.677
Oh, yeah.
Um, no, it's my aunt.

18:57.701 --> 18:59.201
She was my mother's sister.

18:59.225 --> 19:01.638
I haven't seen her in years.

19:01.662 --> 19:04.989
This is more so... support
for my mother.

19:05.013 --> 19:07.557
But we were all kind of
expecting it, right?

19:07.581 --> 19:09.211
She did send her
Christmas gifts.

19:09.235 --> 19:10.951
That's right.

19:10.975 --> 19:12.910
Which is why someone needs
to go and represent

19:12.934 --> 19:15.217
since this one is
so afraid of flying.

19:15.241 --> 19:17.219
Yeah, why are you so afraid
to fly?

19:17.243 --> 19:19.395
Things without wings
weren't meant to fly.

19:19.419 --> 19:21.092
Oh.

19:21.116 --> 19:22.963
You know, that's actually
a very good point.

19:22.987 --> 19:25.444
Honestly, I have never really
been a fan of flying, either.

19:25.468 --> 19:27.359
Great. Then we have lots
to talk about.

19:27.383 --> 19:31.233
Well, that is if she wants
to take the job.

19:31.257 --> 19:34.323
Well, if you're sure
you'll have me, um,

19:34.347 --> 19:35.391
I'd love to.

19:36.523 --> 19:38.501
Right.

19:38.525 --> 19:39.613
We're gonna have a lot of fun.

19:47.142 --> 19:49.120
And in other
news, local authorities

19:49.144 --> 19:52.079
are still investigating
the murder of 21-year-old

19:52.103 --> 19:56.519
Claire Carven, a SoCal student
who was found dead Friday night

19:56.543 --> 19:58.260
in a home
where she was babysitting

19:58.284 --> 20:01.045
for a family in Sherman Oaks.

20:01.069 --> 20:03.134
Carven, an exemplary student,

20:03.158 --> 20:06.224
and member of the
Beta Sigma Eta sorority

20:06.248 --> 20:09.445
at her school,
was reportedly deceased

20:09.469 --> 20:12.274
when officers arrived
on the scene.

20:12.298 --> 20:15.451
Police are still searching
for a delivery driver

20:15.475 --> 20:17.496
who was reportedly
delivering a pizza

20:17.520 --> 20:19.106
at the time of the murder

20:19.130 --> 20:20.349
for questioning.

21:29.810 --> 21:31.744
What's up?

21:31.768 --> 21:33.572
What's going on? Hey!
Come on in.

21:33.596 --> 21:35.531
Mi casa es su casa.
Oh!

21:35.555 --> 21:37.097
Here, I'll take that.
Oh, thank you.

21:37.121 --> 21:38.316
De Nada.

21:38.340 --> 21:39.839
Hi.
Hi.

21:39.863 --> 21:41.058
Welcome, welcome!
Thank you.

21:41.082 --> 21:42.755
Aw!

21:42.779 --> 21:45.715
Come this way.
I'm gonna give you a dime tour.

21:45.739 --> 21:48.761
So, through here
is the guest wing.

21:48.785 --> 21:50.763
It's where my mom stays
when she's here.

21:50.787 --> 21:52.939
Okay.
This is the sitting room.

21:52.963 --> 21:56.378
Through here is the kitchen.

21:56.402 --> 21:58.380
This is the living room,

21:58.404 --> 22:00.686
and down there
is the home theater.

22:00.710 --> 22:04.211
Over here is the home study,

22:04.235 --> 22:08.607
and right around here
is the upstairs den,

22:08.631 --> 22:11.436
and this is our room,
and my husband David.

22:11.460 --> 22:13.351
David, this Daphne.

22:13.375 --> 22:14.831
Hey. How are you?
Oh. Hi, nice to meet you.

22:14.855 --> 22:16.354
Likewise.

22:16.378 --> 22:17.529
This is a beautiful place
you got here.

22:17.553 --> 22:18.791
Oh, that's all her doing.

22:18.815 --> 22:19.966
I'm just a tenant.

22:19.990 --> 22:20.861
Oh, stop it.

22:22.689 --> 22:25.189
So, of course,
this is the backyard,

22:25.213 --> 22:27.191
the bar...

22:27.215 --> 22:28.956
And I hope you brought
your bathing suit.

22:30.436 --> 22:32.849
Hey, Karen,
can I ask you something?

22:32.873 --> 22:35.591
Yeah.
Why me?

22:35.615 --> 22:38.594
I mean, I'm super grateful
for the opportunity,

22:38.618 --> 22:41.423
but after everything
you've heard,

22:41.447 --> 22:42.404
why me?

22:44.450 --> 22:48.081
So, about a year ago,

22:48.105 --> 22:50.606
I picked up Toby from school

22:50.630 --> 22:54.566
and he's acting,
I don't know, weird.

22:54.590 --> 22:56.394
He's having a glass of milk.

22:56.418 --> 22:59.354
Next thing I know,
he's puking it up.

22:59.378 --> 23:00.833
I assume he has a stomach bug,

23:00.857 --> 23:03.706
so I give him water
to stay hydrated

23:03.730 --> 23:06.926
and an antacid
to settle his stomach.

23:06.950 --> 23:09.886
A little while later,
I put him to bed,

23:09.910 --> 23:12.279
and a couple hours after that,

23:12.303 --> 23:14.020
I wake up...

23:14.044 --> 23:15.916
to go check on him...

23:18.005 --> 23:19.374
and he's not better.

23:19.398 --> 23:22.226
He's, he's worse.

23:24.490 --> 23:28.034
And I just remember
that, that sweet smell

23:28.058 --> 23:30.820
coming out of his pores.

23:30.844 --> 23:34.084
And that's when I knew
he'd gone into ketoacidosis.

23:34.108 --> 23:36.086
Meaning he's diabetic.

23:36.110 --> 23:37.783
Yeah.

23:37.807 --> 23:40.960
He's my baby.
He's my, he's my son.

23:40.984 --> 23:44.094
And I didn't even see the signs.

23:44.118 --> 23:45.946
It was an honest mistake.

23:48.122 --> 23:50.405
Honest mistakes happen.

23:50.429 --> 23:54.800
And I know from experience

23:54.824 --> 23:56.498
that when you are a good person

23:56.522 --> 24:00.197
who makes an honest mistake,

24:00.221 --> 24:02.528
you're never gonna make
that kind of mistake again.

24:04.791 --> 24:06.619
And that is why I hired you.

24:09.709 --> 24:11.972
So, can I trust you with my son?

24:12.755 --> 24:13.843
Of course.

24:14.931 --> 24:15.889
Good.

24:19.806 --> 24:21.740
I mean, I guess.
Right?

24:21.764 --> 24:23.046
Here, baby.
I'll take that?

24:23.070 --> 24:24.482
Yeah.

24:24.506 --> 24:26.005
Oh, are you sure
you're gonna be okay

24:26.029 --> 24:27.398
without us the whole weekend?

24:27.422 --> 24:28.921
Mom, I'll be fine.

24:28.945 --> 24:30.662
Are you sure
you're gonna be okay

24:30.686 --> 24:32.882
without me
for the whole weekend?

24:32.906 --> 24:33.970
I don't know.

24:33.994 --> 24:35.691
I don't know. Oh!

24:37.258 --> 24:40.672
I will guard him with my life.
Promise.

24:40.696 --> 24:43.588
Thanks.
Give me a hug, buddy.

24:43.612 --> 24:45.416
Hey, and if grandma calls
the landline,

24:45.440 --> 24:48.114
just, uh, tell her
we're already on our way.

24:48.138 --> 24:49.986
And don't you two have
too much fun, okay?

24:50.010 --> 24:51.944
All right.
We'll try not to.

24:51.968 --> 24:53.816
Oh, and there's a spare key
on the counter.

24:53.840 --> 24:55.208
In case you guys need to leave
for any reason,

24:55.232 --> 24:56.340
just please lock up.

24:56.364 --> 24:58.516
And we left cash on the credenza

24:58.540 --> 25:00.126
if you wanna order
take-out or anything.

25:00.150 --> 25:02.302
Pizza?
I could go for some pizza.

25:02.326 --> 25:03.478
Thin crust, buddy. All right?

25:03.502 --> 25:04.740
And no computer after 8:00 p.m.

25:04.764 --> 25:06.113
You follow me?

25:08.158 --> 25:09.962
Loud and clear. Love you.

25:09.986 --> 25:10.963
Love you, too.
Love you.

25:10.987 --> 25:12.095
Bye.
Bye.

25:12.119 --> 25:14.077
Bye.
Bye. Drive safe.

25:31.181 --> 25:32.139
Ooh.

25:33.270 --> 25:34.987
Yeah, but... Ah!

25:37.884 --> 25:40.427
Pizza's here.
I-I'll get it.

25:40.451 --> 25:43.605
I don't have to worry
about you cheating, do I?

25:43.629 --> 25:45.500
Do I look like I need to cheat
to win this game?

25:46.545 --> 25:48.305
Okay, Toby, we'll see.

25:48.329 --> 25:49.567
And what was that?

25:49.591 --> 25:50.873
What just happened here?

25:50.897 --> 25:52.614
Yeah, that's right.
What happened?

25:52.638 --> 25:53.639
You think I can't play checkers.

25:57.033 --> 25:58.707
Mrs. Andrews?

25:58.731 --> 26:00.602
No, I-I'm the babysitter.

26:04.650 --> 26:06.584
Parents out of town?

26:06.608 --> 26:10.569
N-no, uh, they will be back
any minute now.

26:12.048 --> 26:14.549
That'll be $16.56.

26:14.573 --> 26:16.183
Here you go.

26:17.663 --> 26:19.403
Keep the change.

26:23.973 --> 26:26.125
You sure?

26:26.149 --> 26:27.324
Yeah, I'm sure.

26:29.544 --> 26:30.501
Thanks.

26:39.728 --> 26:41.227
Toby, you scared me.

26:42.601 --> 26:44.622
Pepperoni and floor shine.

26:44.646 --> 26:46.189
Tasty.

26:46.213 --> 26:48.757
I'm sorry.

26:48.781 --> 26:51.174
What kinda pizza man
doesn't drive a delivery car?

27:08.670 --> 27:09.584
Toby?

27:11.542 --> 27:13.216
Hey, Toby.

27:13.240 --> 27:15.435
Come on. Let's get you to bed.
Hm?

27:15.459 --> 27:16.417
Come on.

27:18.462 --> 27:19.463
Come on.

27:23.206 --> 27:24.686
All right. Come here.

27:47.230 --> 27:49.600
Can I help you?

27:49.624 --> 27:53.256
Um, I-I feel bad

27:53.280 --> 27:55.824
so I came back.

27:55.848 --> 28:00.567
Um, you gave me $40 by accident.

28:00.591 --> 28:03.701
And that's, uh, way too much
for a pizza.

28:03.725 --> 28:05.553
No, I-I, I gave you a $20.

28:08.295 --> 28:10.229
No, see? $40.

28:10.253 --> 28:13.189
Well, the people that I'm
sitting for paid for it.

28:13.213 --> 28:15.278
So, I-I'll just pay them back.

28:15.302 --> 28:16.583
It's fine. It's on me.

28:16.607 --> 28:17.913
That's nice.

28:19.872 --> 28:22.198
Shouldn't they be back already?

28:22.222 --> 28:23.223
They are.

28:27.488 --> 28:29.292
I don't see any extra cars.

28:29.316 --> 28:32.251
Yeah, they, uh, they had
to take a lift in.

28:32.275 --> 28:33.949
'Cause their car's
getting repaired.

28:33.973 --> 28:36.865
So they can't get it
till tomorrow.

28:36.889 --> 28:40.651
But if they're back,
what are you still doing?

28:40.675 --> 28:44.524
I am staying until they get
their car tomorrow.

28:44.548 --> 28:48.224
And, you know, we were actually
all heading to bed. So...

28:48.248 --> 28:49.423
Do you wanna go out sometime?

28:50.641 --> 28:52.010
Actually, I have a boyfriend.

28:52.034 --> 28:54.186
But thank you.

28:54.210 --> 28:56.212
Goodnight.
It's a shame.

28:58.562 --> 29:00.540
You're really pretty.

29:00.564 --> 29:01.740
Thank you.

29:02.828 --> 29:04.501
It's very nice of you.

29:04.525 --> 29:07.634
Um, but I, I should really
get the kid to bed.

29:07.658 --> 29:08.616
'Course you do.

29:09.878 --> 29:12.248
Hey.

29:12.272 --> 29:15.294
If that boyfriend of yours
ever screws up,

29:15.318 --> 29:17.296
think of me, will you?

29:17.320 --> 29:19.801
Sure. You got it.

29:20.541 --> 29:21.455
Night.

31:29.191 --> 31:31.082
You're up late.
Okay.

31:31.106 --> 31:33.693
I'm kinda freaking out.
What's goin' on?

31:33.717 --> 31:35.434
Well, there was this pizza guy
here earlier

31:35.458 --> 31:38.307
and, I don't know, he was just
really creeping me out.

31:38.331 --> 31:40.570
And-and he left and then he came
back and said that

31:40.594 --> 31:41.701
I overpaid him.

31:41.725 --> 31:42.833
Well, did you?

31:42.857 --> 31:44.617
I don't know. Maybe.

31:44.641 --> 31:46.619
But... Okay, he was gone
for a really long time

31:46.643 --> 31:48.839
and-and then he came back
and was...

31:48.863 --> 31:50.362
He-he was knocking on the door
and then he just

31:50.386 --> 31:53.235
started asking me
all sorts of weird stuff.

31:53.259 --> 31:57.195
Oh! Like, "Do you want anchovies
on your tombstone?" or...

31:57.219 --> 32:00.198
Kaci, I'm serious.

32:00.222 --> 32:02.070
What's goin' on?

32:02.094 --> 32:03.443
Hold on.

32:12.539 --> 32:15.692
Just, like, where his parents
were and stuff.

32:15.716 --> 32:17.563
Then I just looked out
on the backyard

32:17.587 --> 32:20.436
and there are footprints
on the deck from the wet lawn.

32:20.460 --> 32:22.264
So what?

32:22.288 --> 32:24.048
Girl, it's a big house, right?

32:24.072 --> 32:26.311
He probably just went
around the back

32:26.335 --> 32:29.314
because you didn't answer
the first time he tried.

32:29.338 --> 32:30.750
Maybe. I don't know.

32:30.774 --> 32:31.838
Look, if you're that freaked out

32:31.862 --> 32:34.015
why don't you just call the cops

32:34.039 --> 32:35.755
and file a report?

32:35.779 --> 32:37.192
Well, because I don't
wanna get him in trouble

32:37.216 --> 32:38.933
in case I'm overreacting.

32:38.957 --> 32:41.022
Well, look,
I get off in an hour.

32:41.046 --> 32:42.240
Do you want me to come over?

32:42.264 --> 32:44.677
No, it's okay.

32:44.701 --> 32:47.637
I don't wanna spook Toby.
He's already asleep.

32:47.661 --> 32:49.204
I'm sure I'm fine.

32:49.228 --> 32:50.553
I know you are, too.

32:50.577 --> 32:54.035
But, hey,
if anything else happens,

32:54.059 --> 32:55.471
you call me, all right?

32:55.495 --> 32:57.473
Yeah. Okay, I love you.

32:57.497 --> 32:59.083
Take care, okay?

33:45.458 --> 33:46.609
Daphne.

33:46.633 --> 33:48.243
My mom's on the phone for you.

33:49.810 --> 33:51.072
Coming.

33:52.813 --> 33:55.096
Okay. Hey, Karen.

33:55.120 --> 33:57.794
Hi! How's it going over there?

33:57.818 --> 33:59.230
I gave him his
shots this morning

33:59.254 --> 34:01.624
and now he's just
doing the dishes.

34:01.648 --> 34:03.104
Oh, that's so good to hear.

34:03.128 --> 34:04.496
Well, we're about to head up

34:04.520 --> 34:05.671
to the funeral and the wake

34:05.695 --> 34:07.369
and it's in Wine Country, so,

34:07.393 --> 34:09.980
we might fall off
the grid for a little while.

34:10.004 --> 34:12.069
Yeah, uh, that
shouldn't be a problem.

34:12.092 --> 34:13.331
I'm sure we'll be fine.

34:13.355 --> 34:15.246
Better than fine, Mom.

34:15.270 --> 34:16.856
What'd we agree on
the other day?

34:16.880 --> 34:19.120
That you're a big boy

34:19.143 --> 34:21.513
and you can mostly
take care of yourself.

34:21.536 --> 34:23.472
Glad you remembered.

34:23.496 --> 34:26.214
Okay, well just don't have
so much fun that you forget...

34:26.237 --> 34:30.130
To administer my insulin shot
again before dinner. Duh.

34:30.155 --> 34:31.741
Yeah, he was only a little
squirmy this morning.

34:31.764 --> 34:33.047
So, hopefully,
he's better tonight.

34:33.071 --> 34:35.310
Oh! I did not.

34:35.333 --> 34:37.094
Okay. Well...
Maybe a little.

34:37.118 --> 34:38.965
I will call you crazy kids
later this evening.

34:38.989 --> 34:40.141
All right. Thanks, Karen.

34:40.165 --> 34:41.208
Bye.
Bye.

34:54.179 --> 34:56.157
Toby, you doin' okay up there?

34:56.181 --> 34:57.419
Yeah.

35:24.731 --> 35:26.080
Toby?

35:31.520 --> 35:33.043
Toby?

36:11.560 --> 36:13.277
9-1-1.
What's your emergency?

36:13.301 --> 36:15.236
Hi, um, my name is Daphne Hart.

36:15.260 --> 36:16.672
I think there might be somebody

36:16.696 --> 36:18.326
in the house that
I'm babysitting at.

36:18.350 --> 36:19.718
What is the address
of the residence?

36:19.742 --> 36:22.678
It's, um, 1126 Aspendale.

36:22.702 --> 36:24.680
Are you aware of anyone else
in the house?

36:24.704 --> 36:26.247
Uh, just the kid that
I'm babysitting

36:26.271 --> 36:28.379
and he's sleeping upstairs
which is where I am now.

36:28.403 --> 36:30.512
Okay, ma'am, uh, please sit
tight and we'll send

36:30.536 --> 36:31.861
dispatch in the area
to check things out.

36:31.885 --> 36:32.973
Okay. Thank you.

37:08.008 --> 37:10.682
Oh, jeez.

37:10.706 --> 37:13.294
I-I-I'm sorry. It's just...
You scared me.

37:13.318 --> 37:15.687
Oh, you scared me, too.

37:15.711 --> 37:18.777
I-I'm Daphne. I'm the babysitter
for the Andrews.

37:18.801 --> 37:20.692
I thought the Andrews
were out of town.

37:20.716 --> 37:23.260
Yeah, they are.
Well, everybody except Toby.

37:23.284 --> 37:25.306
So, I'm, I'm watching him.

37:25.330 --> 37:26.916
And you are?

37:26.940 --> 37:29.464
I'm sorry.
I'm Audra Simonetti.

37:30.683 --> 37:32.748
I work for the maid services.

37:32.772 --> 37:35.011
Okay. Yeah, no.
That makes sense.

37:35.035 --> 37:36.534
Uh, sorry, it's just, nobody

37:36.558 --> 37:38.493
told me that
anybody was coming by.

37:38.517 --> 37:41.191
Our schedule, Gloria, told me
that no one would be here

37:41.215 --> 37:43.149
so I didn't even think
to call beforehand.

37:43.173 --> 37:45.108
Oh, no, no, no.
It's, it's totally fine.

37:45.132 --> 37:47.153
I'm... It's just me and Toby.

37:47.177 --> 37:49.591
I mean, he was gonna go, but...

37:49.615 --> 37:51.854
Anyway, he's upstairs, napping.

37:51.878 --> 37:53.769
Have you been here before?

37:53.793 --> 37:57.251
No. I mean, I-I-I've worked
in this neighborhood before

37:57.275 --> 37:59.992
but this is my first time
cleaning for this home.

38:00.016 --> 38:01.820
It is a nice place.

38:01.844 --> 38:03.431
Yeah, it is.

38:03.455 --> 38:05.389
Well, they all are,
here in Toluca Lake.

38:05.413 --> 38:08.131
Oh, I used to wanna
live here so bad.

38:08.155 --> 38:10.351
Hmm.

38:10.375 --> 38:12.004
Oh, thank you.
Whereabouts do you live?

38:12.028 --> 38:13.876
Um, I'm just ten minutes away

38:13.900 --> 38:15.791
right off of Ventura
and Studio City.

38:15.815 --> 38:18.359
I live by the village,
just past the 170.

38:18.383 --> 38:21.362
Mm, yeah, I used to work
over there.

38:21.386 --> 38:22.493
What'd you do?

38:22.517 --> 38:24.190
I'm, uh, a nurse.

38:24.214 --> 38:27.150
Oh, that is a tough job.

38:27.174 --> 38:28.804
I commend you.

38:28.828 --> 38:30.893
What brought you here?

38:30.917 --> 38:34.984
I was, um, recently laid off,
actually.

38:35.008 --> 38:39.031
Oh, that's too bad.

38:39.055 --> 38:40.816
What brought you
into babysitting?

38:40.840 --> 38:42.861
Well, I needed the work

38:42.885 --> 38:45.386
and, um, Toby's diabetic

38:45.410 --> 38:48.998
so I think Mrs. Andrews
just felt more comfortable

38:49.022 --> 38:50.478
having a nurse
around the house, you know.

38:50.502 --> 38:52.262
I'd feel the same way
if it were my child.

38:52.286 --> 38:53.829
Do you have kids?

38:53.853 --> 38:55.483
I used to work
at the pediatrics department

38:55.507 --> 38:56.527
in my old job.

38:56.551 --> 38:58.703
Sadly, I do not.

38:58.727 --> 39:00.139
Oh.

39:00.163 --> 39:03.404
Well, it's never too late,
right?

39:03.428 --> 39:04.733
For me, it is.

39:07.649 --> 39:10.324
So, are you, uh, single?

39:10.348 --> 39:13.655
Uh, as of recently, yeah.

39:15.309 --> 39:16.417
What happened?

39:16.441 --> 39:18.157
He was just

39:18.181 --> 39:20.270
insanely selfish and...

39:21.663 --> 39:23.249
not the great guy
I thought he was

39:23.273 --> 39:25.232
at the end of the day,
unfortunately.

39:27.800 --> 39:31.040
So, how about you?
Do you want kids?

39:31.064 --> 39:34.435
I do, yeah. Eventually.

39:34.459 --> 39:36.437
I feel like I still have
a lot of growing up to do.

39:36.461 --> 39:40.441
Hm. Well, you'll find your way.

39:40.465 --> 39:42.965
You're still young and gorgeous.

39:42.989 --> 39:45.097
You have your entire life
ahead of you.

39:45.121 --> 39:47.796
Thanks.

39:47.820 --> 39:50.146
It just doesn't feel like that
right now.

39:50.170 --> 39:51.954
Well, it doesn't matter
what you feel.

39:53.216 --> 39:55.131
All that matters is what is.

39:56.698 --> 39:59.962
Yeah. I guess you're right.

40:09.276 --> 40:11.210
Oh, who could that be?

40:11.234 --> 40:13.343
Oh. Um...

40:13.367 --> 40:15.476
I called 9-1-1.

40:15.500 --> 40:18.348
I-I didn't know who you were.
That, that's probably them.

40:18.372 --> 40:21.133
Let me just go deal with them.
I'll be right back.

40:21.157 --> 40:22.811
Wow, you really were spooked.

40:26.075 --> 40:27.618
Hi.

40:27.642 --> 40:29.185
Yeah, we received
a call from you.

40:29.209 --> 40:31.361
Yeah, I'm sorry. That was
just a misunderstanding.

40:31.385 --> 40:33.058
I heard a noise
so I called you guys.

40:33.082 --> 40:35.496
But I realized
it was just the maid.

40:35.520 --> 40:37.062
Are you Daphne Hart?

40:37.086 --> 40:38.479
Yeah, I'm the babysitter.

40:39.872 --> 40:42.459
And you don't have any, um,

40:42.483 --> 40:44.853
reason you might want me to look
around and check things out?

40:44.877 --> 40:47.421
I mean, you're welcome
to check things out

40:47.445 --> 40:49.292
but I am okay.

40:49.316 --> 40:51.381
Okay. Um...

40:51.405 --> 40:52.774
How about I just
take a look around

40:52.798 --> 40:54.210
make sure everything looks okay.

40:54.234 --> 40:55.472
No break-ins. Hm?

40:55.496 --> 40:57.735
Okay, yeah.

40:57.759 --> 40:59.171
You let me know
if you need me, okay?

40:59.195 --> 41:00.762
Yeah. Thank you.

41:16.038 --> 41:17.407
Oh!
Oh! Uh...

41:17.431 --> 41:18.843
Sorry.

41:18.867 --> 41:20.323
We have got to stop doing this.

41:20.347 --> 41:22.020
Yeah.

41:22.044 --> 41:23.848
So, is everything all right now?

41:23.872 --> 41:26.242
Oh, yeah. No, everything's fine.

41:26.266 --> 41:30.202
Still, you can
never be too careful.

41:30.226 --> 41:32.117
I assume you heard
about that poor girl

41:32.141 --> 41:33.205
on the news the other night.

41:33.229 --> 41:35.338
I did. That's so scary.

41:35.362 --> 41:36.861
It's just awful
what people will do

41:36.885 --> 41:38.254
to other people these days,
isn't it?

41:38.278 --> 41:39.734
Yeah.

41:39.758 --> 41:40.865
I guess it's a good thing

41:40.889 --> 41:42.519
they got here so quick

41:42.543 --> 41:44.371
just in case it had been
a real emergency.

41:47.766 --> 41:50.962
I think he just felt better
if he could check things out.

41:50.986 --> 41:53.598
Probably wanting
to check you out, no doubt.

41:56.470 --> 41:58.361
Well, on to the next.

41:58.385 --> 41:59.971
I'm finished,
so I'll be leaving.

41:59.995 --> 42:01.103
Okay. Oh, wait.

42:01.127 --> 42:02.887
Do you get a tip or something?

42:02.911 --> 42:04.672
I, I might have some cash...

42:04.696 --> 42:06.804
Oh, please, no. I'm, I'm fine.
But thank you.

42:06.828 --> 42:08.806
You've done enough already.

42:08.830 --> 42:10.373
Really? What did I do?

42:10.397 --> 42:13.115
You kept me company
for a little while.

42:13.139 --> 42:14.595
It was nice talking to you,
Daphne.

42:14.619 --> 42:16.597
Yeah, it was nice
talking to you, too.

42:16.621 --> 42:18.144
Bye.
Bye.

42:34.943 --> 42:36.815
Hey, Tobs.
Hey.

42:38.773 --> 42:41.273
Mind if I join you?
Oh, sure.

42:41.297 --> 42:42.927
Did you have a good nap?
Yeah.

42:42.951 --> 42:44.407
Sometimes I get a little tired

42:44.431 --> 42:45.800
after I'm in the sun
for too long.

42:45.824 --> 42:48.150
Makes sense.

42:48.174 --> 42:49.891
It's a pretty cool fort
you got going on.

42:49.915 --> 42:51.240
Thanks.

42:51.264 --> 42:53.938
You got walkies?
Yeah.

42:53.962 --> 42:57.463
They don't get much use being
an only child and all, but, mm.

42:57.487 --> 42:59.683
Right.

42:59.707 --> 43:01.946
So, what are you working on?

43:01.970 --> 43:03.252
Do I get to find out now?

43:03.276 --> 43:05.167
Okay, fine.

43:05.191 --> 43:06.995
But it's a surprise
for my mom and dad.

43:07.019 --> 43:08.518
So you have to promise
you won't say anything.

43:08.542 --> 43:10.825
Okay.
Promise?

43:10.849 --> 43:13.131
I promise. Okay, fine.
Pinky promise.

43:13.155 --> 43:15.046
There you go. Okay.

43:15.070 --> 43:19.616
So this here looks like
an ordinary bird house.

43:19.640 --> 43:22.097
But really,
it's a yard monitoring system.

43:22.121 --> 43:24.316
A yard monitoring system?

43:24.340 --> 43:27.755
Yup. See, up here you can put
bird feeder to feed the birds.

43:27.779 --> 43:28.930
Uh-huh. Yeah.
Obviously.

43:28.954 --> 43:30.801
But down here,

43:30.825 --> 43:32.977
there's a hidden compartment
to put a camera.

43:33.001 --> 43:36.198
So you can see, like, visitors
and burglars and stuff.

43:36.222 --> 43:38.722
Visitors and burglars?

43:38.746 --> 43:41.682
Yeah, I mean, my parents have
a lot of expensive junk

43:41.706 --> 43:43.640
so I gotta protect it.

43:43.664 --> 43:45.642
I see.

43:45.666 --> 43:47.339
Well, it seems like you got
a pretty solid

43:47.363 --> 43:49.124
no home invasion plan here.

43:49.148 --> 43:50.734
I-I do.

43:50.758 --> 43:53.389
Now I just need my dad
to get a mini-camera

43:53.413 --> 43:54.738
and, bam!

43:54.762 --> 43:57.088
Yard monitoring system installed

43:57.112 --> 43:59.308
for a steal-of-a-price
on a normal one.

43:59.332 --> 44:02.311
Wow, I'm impressed.
Thank you.

44:02.335 --> 44:04.705
You know, I bet you're gonna
make a lotta money

44:04.729 --> 44:07.185
off all these
creative endeavors one day.

44:07.209 --> 44:08.534
That's the plan.

44:08.558 --> 44:09.753
But if I can help people

44:09.777 --> 44:11.886
while doing it, it's a win-win.

44:14.216 --> 44:15.846
Just don't tell anyone I'm soft.

44:15.870 --> 44:18.153
Oh, no. Our little secret.
Yeah, yeah.

44:18.177 --> 44:19.502
Promise. Pinky promise.
Yeah.

44:19.526 --> 44:20.634
There you go.
Yeah, there we go.

44:20.658 --> 44:22.940
There we go.

44:22.964 --> 44:25.073
Uh, I'm hungry.
Yeah, you wanna go eat?

44:25.097 --> 44:26.204
Yeah.
All right. Let's go.

44:26.228 --> 44:27.336
Let's go.

44:27.360 --> 44:29.077
Okay.
Yeah.

44:29.101 --> 44:31.427
What do you want for dinner?

44:31.451 --> 44:32.713
Uh...

44:35.107 --> 44:36.084
I don't even know what we have.

44:36.108 --> 44:37.999
Okay.

44:38.023 --> 44:41.132
Uh, how about I check out
and see what we gotta work with,

44:41.156 --> 44:43.004
you go grab your shot,
we'll get that ready

44:43.028 --> 44:44.396
so we can get it out of the way,

44:44.420 --> 44:46.442
and I will make us
something yummy.

44:46.466 --> 44:48.705
How does that sound?
All right.

44:48.729 --> 44:50.489
Hey, I should probably
call my mom too

44:50.513 --> 44:51.969
before it gets too late, right?

44:51.993 --> 44:53.952
Yes, good idea.

44:56.998 --> 44:58.347
Huh.

44:59.566 --> 45:01.805
Where did I put my phone?

45:01.829 --> 45:03.067
Uh, Toby, I'll be right back.

45:03.091 --> 45:04.895
I think I left
my phone upstairs.

45:04.919 --> 45:05.877
Okay.

45:29.465 --> 45:30.640
Jeremy?

46:06.285 --> 46:08.026
Jeremy?

46:39.318 --> 46:41.165
Oh! Je-Jeremy!

46:41.189 --> 46:43.211
What are you doing here?

46:43.235 --> 46:46.127
You're trespassing, by the way.

46:46.151 --> 46:47.868
You wouldn't respond
to any of my texts.

46:47.892 --> 46:49.130
What was I supposed to do?

46:49.154 --> 46:50.131
How did you even find out

46:50.155 --> 46:52.220
where I was anyway?

46:52.244 --> 46:53.743
Dr. Burkes spilled the beans

46:53.767 --> 46:56.311
at work tonight.
Her friend hired you.

46:56.335 --> 46:58.443
And did you take that
as an open invitation

46:58.467 --> 47:00.663
to break into a property
unannounced?

47:00.687 --> 47:04.058
Daphne, this is the only way
I can get you to talk to me.

47:04.082 --> 47:05.407
You need to leave.

47:05.431 --> 47:06.800
Daphne, come on.

47:06.824 --> 47:08.932
I don't want to talk to you,
Jeremy.

47:08.956 --> 47:10.978
And even if I did,

47:11.002 --> 47:13.067
you really wouldn't like
what I had to say.

47:13.091 --> 47:15.156
How about you try me?

47:15.180 --> 47:18.550
I told you, we're done.
I meant that.

47:18.574 --> 47:20.030
You're gonna throw away
a year of us going out

47:20.054 --> 47:21.727
over this one stupid thing
that happened?

47:21.751 --> 47:22.752
Stupid?

47:24.450 --> 47:26.776
Not only did I lose my job,

47:26.800 --> 47:28.822
I lost my dignity.

47:28.846 --> 47:30.388
And a child lost their life.

47:30.412 --> 47:33.391
That's anything but stupid,
don't you think?

47:33.415 --> 47:36.133
I'll tell the board what
Dr. Mixer did.

47:36.157 --> 47:38.135
Okay?

47:38.159 --> 47:40.050
I'll tell them that he asked you
to get his cup of coffee

47:40.074 --> 47:41.922
and that he offered
to watch your patients

47:41.946 --> 47:45.055
while you were gone
and then he totally failed.

47:45.079 --> 47:48.885
I mean, maybe
you'll get your job back.

47:48.909 --> 47:50.756
Daph, look, I-I-I feel terrible

47:50.780 --> 47:53.150
and I just wanna
fix this for you.

47:53.174 --> 47:55.370
And for us.

47:55.394 --> 47:57.875
This isn't just about a job,
Jeremy.

47:59.137 --> 48:01.593
Dr. Mixer failed, yeah.

48:01.617 --> 48:03.944
But so did I.

48:03.968 --> 48:06.947
Those people
that we're responsible for,

48:06.971 --> 48:09.123
their lives are in our hands
every second

48:09.147 --> 48:12.039
of every hour of every day.

48:12.063 --> 48:15.869
So I deserve
what happened to me.

48:15.893 --> 48:18.784
And you and I just can't go back
to the way things were.

48:18.808 --> 48:20.830
Pretending that we don't need
to be held accountable

48:20.854 --> 48:23.833
for the roles that we played
in the death of that little boy.

48:23.857 --> 48:27.010
Just leave me alone, Jeremy.

48:27.034 --> 48:28.340
Please.

48:36.609 --> 48:37.891
Who was that?

48:37.915 --> 48:39.544
Just my ex.

48:39.568 --> 48:40.961
He's gone.
Don't worry about it.

49:33.622 --> 49:34.928
Yeah...

49:45.156 --> 49:46.548
Oh, come on.

50:48.523 --> 50:50.327
Is he still out there?

50:50.351 --> 50:52.373
No, he left.

50:52.397 --> 50:54.790
Okay, let's do this.
Okay.

50:55.748 --> 50:57.315
Let's see how this goes.

51:00.492 --> 51:01.991
Okay. Yeah.
Good?

51:02.015 --> 51:02.929
Here we go.

51:04.626 --> 51:07.214
Doesn't hurt?
I'm used to it.

51:07.238 --> 51:09.520
A little.

51:15.159 --> 51:17.267
Hey, Toby, have you seen
my phone?

51:17.291 --> 51:19.704
No, where'd you last see it?

51:19.728 --> 51:22.881
I thought I left it in here
and now I can't find it.

51:22.905 --> 51:24.883
Maybe you left it
out by the pool

51:24.907 --> 51:26.711
or up in my room.

51:26.735 --> 51:28.670
Yeah, maybe.

51:28.694 --> 51:30.628
Can you go check upstairs
and I'll go check by the pool?

51:30.652 --> 51:32.915
Yeah.
Thanks.

51:56.113 --> 51:57.481
Hey.
You didn't find it?

51:57.505 --> 51:59.266
No, I even checked your room.

51:59.290 --> 52:02.399
Huh. Let me call
from the landline. One sec.

52:02.423 --> 52:03.618
Okay.

52:09.735 --> 52:11.278
There's no dial tone.

52:11.302 --> 52:12.216
That's weird.

52:14.348 --> 52:15.891
Oh.

52:15.915 --> 52:17.351
Wait, no, no, no.
Toby, hold on.

52:25.054 --> 52:26.969
All right. Get behind me.
Come here.

52:38.329 --> 52:40.742
Kaci, thank God.
Oh, wow.

52:40.766 --> 52:42.744
Is babysitting that boring?

52:42.768 --> 52:45.181
Oh, you must be Toby Andrews.

52:45.205 --> 52:46.487
Yeah.
Yeah.

52:46.511 --> 52:48.402
Toby, this is Kaci,
my best friend.

52:48.426 --> 52:49.707
We worked
at the hospital together.

52:49.731 --> 52:51.622
She works with Dr. Burke.
Cool.

52:51.646 --> 52:53.624
Shannon's great.
Yeah, okay.

52:53.648 --> 52:56.323
Yeah. Cute kid.
Y'all want some Chinese?

52:56.347 --> 53:00.240
You are now officially
my favorite person.

53:00.264 --> 53:01.265
Welcome to our home.

53:05.269 --> 53:07.247
Hey, Kaci, didn't you have
a date tonight?

53:07.271 --> 53:10.902
Girl, you know
how these dating apps go.

53:10.926 --> 53:13.383
He looked nothing
like his picture, okay.

53:13.407 --> 53:14.906
And he kept going on and on

53:14.930 --> 53:17.474
about this album
that he's producing.

53:17.498 --> 53:19.998
Like, I mean, on and on and on.

53:20.022 --> 53:21.913
So I had to cut the drink short.

53:21.937 --> 53:23.785
And by cutting the drink short,
I mean

53:23.809 --> 53:27.092
having wine and telling
him I had to go. Okay?

53:27.116 --> 53:30.444
So I, um, I take it
there won't be a second date?

53:30.468 --> 53:32.446
No.

53:32.470 --> 53:35.188
Wait, wait, why don't you just
do it the old-fashioned way

53:35.212 --> 53:37.755
and go to a bar to meet a guy?

53:37.779 --> 53:40.149
Well, see,
I mostly work overnights.

53:40.173 --> 53:41.455
So when I have a night off

53:41.479 --> 53:42.934
the last thing I wanna do

53:42.958 --> 53:45.807
is meet some guy at a bar.

53:45.831 --> 53:48.375
Plus, everyone knows
I'm a lightweight.

53:48.399 --> 53:50.725
Mm-hmm.

53:50.749 --> 53:52.727
You shouldn't have a problem
meeting a guy.

53:52.751 --> 53:55.382
You're too pretty.
Aw!

53:55.406 --> 53:56.774
You see, now that makes you

53:56.798 --> 54:00.125
my favorite person
in the world, kid.

54:00.149 --> 54:02.998
So maybe you're just too picky.

54:03.022 --> 54:06.828
I told you he was a smart kid.

54:06.852 --> 54:10.440
Okay, you know what?

54:10.464 --> 54:13.356
So, um, how come
you never texted me back

54:13.380 --> 54:15.706
when I told you
I was on my way over here?

54:15.730 --> 54:17.882
It's the weirdest thing.
I cannot find my phone.

54:17.906 --> 54:19.536
Yeah, we looked everywhere.

54:19.560 --> 54:22.191
Well, is your ringer on?
I'll just call it. Here.

54:22.215 --> 54:24.043
Would you, please.
The phone here is not working.

54:26.959 --> 54:29.677
That's weird, it went
straight to voicemail.

54:29.701 --> 54:31.200
Seriously?
Yeah.

54:31.224 --> 54:32.723
My phone was fully charged
this afternoon.

54:32.747 --> 54:34.421
I barely used it all day.
Yeah.

54:34.445 --> 54:37.032
Where else could it have been?

54:37.056 --> 54:38.816
Hey, Toby, do you know where
your mom would keep

54:38.840 --> 54:40.340
the number
to the cleaning service?

54:40.364 --> 54:41.689
I'm sure the maid
just probably moved it

54:41.713 --> 54:42.820
when she was cleaning
the counters.

54:42.844 --> 54:45.127
Maid? What maid?

54:45.151 --> 54:47.651
The maid that was here
while you were taking a nap.

54:47.675 --> 54:50.828
We don't have a maid.

54:50.852 --> 54:54.116
You don't have a cleaning
service that comes on Saturdays?

54:57.206 --> 54:59.010
The maid
probably comes once a week

54:59.034 --> 55:00.708
while you're at school.

55:00.732 --> 55:02.623
Oh, no, no, no. Not a chance.

55:02.647 --> 55:04.364
My grandma always wants
something to do

55:04.388 --> 55:06.801
after she picks me up
from school.

55:06.825 --> 55:09.717
She'll cook and clean
and sometimes do the laundry

55:09.741 --> 55:12.110
which just drives my mom crazy.

55:12.134 --> 55:13.764
Yeah, but this woman
had a maid's uniform

55:13.788 --> 55:16.051
and she had her own
cleaning supplies.

55:18.227 --> 55:20.684
Okay, now I'm freaked out.

55:20.708 --> 55:24.471
No, no, no, um, I'm sure
your mom just hired a maid

55:24.495 --> 55:26.473
for the weekend
because they're out of town.

55:26.497 --> 55:29.998
Right, right.
Girl, I'm sure that's it. Okay?

55:30.022 --> 55:32.285
Yeah. Maybe.

55:38.030 --> 55:39.834
Hey, you wanna stay
and watch a movie?

55:39.858 --> 55:41.575
Well, if I have
any more of this wine,

55:41.599 --> 55:42.706
I may not have a choice.

55:44.471 --> 55:46.275
All right,
how about you go upstairs,

55:46.299 --> 55:47.755
take a bath, get ready for bed,

55:47.779 --> 55:49.670
and then we'll pick out
a movie to watch, yeah?

55:49.694 --> 55:51.348
Sweet.
Okay.

55:55.134 --> 55:58.331
Hey, are you all right?

55:58.355 --> 55:59.549
You seem kind of spooked
the whole time

55:59.573 --> 56:01.203
we were eating dinner.

56:01.227 --> 56:03.510
Yeah, no. I was just thinking.

56:03.534 --> 56:04.815
Did you hear about the girl
who was murdered

56:04.839 --> 56:06.077
last Friday on the news?

56:06.101 --> 56:08.515
What? No.

56:08.539 --> 56:11.126
Yeah. She was babysitting
in Sherman Oaks.

56:11.150 --> 56:14.303
That's not far from here.
No, I know.

56:14.327 --> 56:15.913
And I just remembered they said
they suspected

56:15.937 --> 56:17.828
it was the pizza delivery guy.

56:17.852 --> 56:19.656
What if it's the same guy?

56:19.680 --> 56:21.441
Come on.

56:21.465 --> 56:23.965
If he really murdered someone
last week,

56:23.989 --> 56:26.707
you really think he's still
delivering some damn pizzas.

56:26.731 --> 56:28.448
Well, he wasn't driving
a delivery car.

56:28.472 --> 56:30.101
What if it's a local joint?

56:30.125 --> 56:33.627
Sometimes they don't have
delivery cars.

56:33.651 --> 56:36.499
Look, do you want me to crash
after the movie?

56:36.523 --> 56:39.110
I don't have spin class
until 2:30 tomorrow, girl.

56:39.134 --> 56:42.070
You wouldn't mind?
Not at all.

56:42.094 --> 56:44.072
Okay, yeah. That would actually
make me feel a lot better.

56:44.096 --> 56:45.769
I got you, girl.
Thank you.

56:47.534 --> 56:51.427
So, do you really think
the maid took your phone?

56:51.451 --> 56:54.387
Well, I didn'that first because
she was so sweet in person.

56:54.411 --> 56:57.651
Look, why don't you just call
Toby's mom and ask her?

56:57.675 --> 56:59.653
No, no, I don't wanna do that.

56:59.677 --> 57:01.655
I don't wanna get them
freaked out over nothing.

57:01.679 --> 57:03.744
I mean, they trusted me
with their child

57:03.768 --> 57:06.355
after they found out
everything that happened.

57:06.379 --> 57:08.009
The last thing that I want
is for them to think

57:08.033 --> 57:10.359
I'm some crazy girl accusing
their maid of stealing.

57:10.383 --> 57:13.231
Okay, well, who else
could have done it?

57:13.255 --> 57:15.320
I mean, I don't know, the only
people up here besides us

57:15.344 --> 57:17.497
has been Jeremy, but he was
outside the whole time.

57:17.521 --> 57:18.846
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

57:18.870 --> 57:20.456
Hold up. Rewind.

57:20.480 --> 57:21.936
Jeremy was here?

57:21.960 --> 57:24.460
Yes, he came by earlier.
What?

57:24.484 --> 57:26.506
Well, he talked to Dr. Burke
who told him where I was

57:26.530 --> 57:29.073
so he came over
and jumped the fence.

57:29.097 --> 57:31.989
Oh, my God. I cannot believe
the nerve-of that boy.

57:32.013 --> 57:34.339
Ugh!
Now, hold on.

57:34.363 --> 57:37.038
The gate was closed
earlier when Jeremy was here.

57:37.062 --> 57:42.347
Huh. And the gate was open
when I arrived.

57:43.547 --> 57:45.786
Well, there you have it.

57:45.810 --> 57:48.528
Jeremy never left. Mm-mm.

57:48.552 --> 57:50.878
He probably just figured out
a way to open your gate

57:50.902 --> 57:52.183
and now he messing with you.

57:52.207 --> 57:54.403
Girl,

57:54.427 --> 57:56.536
he's probably the one
who stole your phone.

57:56.560 --> 57:59.539
No. That doesn't even sound like
something Jeremy would do.

57:59.563 --> 58:02.237
My exes have done way worse.

58:02.261 --> 58:04.805
Especially when they're used to
getting what they want.

58:04.829 --> 58:09.026
And when's the last time
Jeremy's heard anyone say no?

58:09.050 --> 58:11.507
Call him. Go ahead.

58:11.531 --> 58:12.856
No.

58:12.880 --> 58:14.554
Uh, no, I don't
wanna do that either.

58:14.578 --> 58:16.556
At least not until I get
to talk to the maid service

58:16.580 --> 58:18.558
and see if, I don't know,
maybe she picked it up

58:18.582 --> 58:19.776
thinking it was hers.

58:19.800 --> 58:22.387
Okay, fine.

58:22.411 --> 58:23.737
You got anything I can wear?

58:23.761 --> 58:25.173
Yeah. It's upstairs.

58:25.197 --> 58:26.870
It's the last room
in the left hallway.

58:26.894 --> 58:28.698
My bag's on the bed
so just take whatever you want.

58:28.722 --> 58:30.221
Okay, cool. I will.

58:30.245 --> 58:32.441
Thanks, Kaci.

58:32.465 --> 58:34.293
Love you.
Love you.

58:53.617 --> 58:54.792
Okay.

58:59.405 --> 59:00.667
Take one of my walkies.

59:01.625 --> 59:03.994
Oh, are you scared?

59:04.018 --> 59:06.606
Oh, no, no, no. It's, um...

59:06.630 --> 59:09.241
It's for you,
in case you get scared.

59:11.635 --> 59:13.158
Thanks, kid.

59:16.422 --> 59:18.555
All right.
Ah...

59:19.773 --> 59:21.993
Goodnight.
Goodnight.

59:38.357 --> 59:41.075
Oh, shoot.
We didn't close the gate.

59:41.099 --> 59:43.231
Crap.

59:49.629 --> 59:51.259
Oh, wait, let me get my phone.

59:51.283 --> 59:52.477
We can use the flashlight.

59:52.501 --> 59:53.764
Okay.

59:57.419 --> 59:58.769
Who closed the gate?

01:00:00.509 --> 01:00:02.487
Daphne.
What?

01:00:02.511 --> 01:00:04.446
My phone is gone.

01:00:04.470 --> 01:00:06.753
What?

01:00:06.777 --> 01:00:08.929
What do you mean?
Yo, Daphne...

01:00:08.953 --> 01:00:10.495
My phone was right here.

01:00:10.519 --> 01:00:12.759
I left it right here.
I know it.

01:00:12.783 --> 01:00:14.369
Are you 100 percent sure?

01:00:14.393 --> 01:00:16.110
Yes, I'm a hundred percent sure.

01:00:16.134 --> 01:00:17.938
I mean, I had a couple
of glasses of wine

01:00:17.962 --> 01:00:20.244
but I'm pretty sure.

01:00:20.268 --> 01:00:21.811
Oh, my God.
What?

01:00:21.835 --> 01:00:23.639
The spare keys are gone.

01:00:23.663 --> 01:00:25.162
What?
Don't play with me, girl.

01:00:25.186 --> 01:00:26.555
It has been there
the entire time

01:00:26.579 --> 01:00:27.556
since the Andrews left.

01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:29.689
The whole time?
Uh-huh.

01:00:31.323 --> 01:00:33.151
Who the hell is that?

01:00:34.892 --> 01:00:36.826
I never thought I'd say this

01:00:36.850 --> 01:00:38.678
but I really hope that's Jeremy.

01:00:40.332 --> 01:00:42.005
There's no one there.

01:00:42.029 --> 01:00:45.052
That's because somebody
is screwing with us. That's why.

01:00:45.076 --> 01:00:46.793
Are all doors locked?
Hold on, hold on.

01:00:46.817 --> 01:00:48.490
I have an idea.
I'll be right back.

01:00:48.514 --> 01:00:50.559
What? What are you doing?
Just hold on. Hold on.

01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:55.956
Hurry up!
Okay.

01:01:05.052 --> 01:01:06.856
Close it, close it, close it.
Girl!

01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:07.988
What you gonna do with that?

01:01:08.012 --> 01:01:09.840
You'll see. You'll see. Okay.

01:01:10.928 --> 01:01:12.993
Oh!
Okay. Okay.

01:01:13.017 --> 01:01:15.386
Now we have our alarm.
Okay.

01:01:15.410 --> 01:01:16.953
Okay, we have to barricade
all the doors

01:01:16.977 --> 01:01:18.651
and make sure
that all the windows are locked.

01:01:18.675 --> 01:01:20.459
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.
Okay.

01:02:16.950 --> 01:02:18.362
Don't creep up on me like that.
Jesus!

01:02:18.386 --> 01:02:20.016
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:22.802
Look, I found another door
in the other wing.

01:02:22.826 --> 01:02:24.804
Okay, what did you do?
I nailed it shut.

01:02:24.828 --> 01:02:27.241
Okay, yeah, that works.
Okay.

01:02:27.265 --> 01:02:28.895
Uh, so...

01:02:28.919 --> 01:02:30.592
what do we do now?

01:02:30.616 --> 01:02:31.573
Um...

01:02:35.926 --> 01:02:37.275
Oh, Jeremy!

01:02:39.103 --> 01:02:41.037
Ooh! It is too cold
for this crap.

01:02:41.061 --> 01:02:42.323
Come on, Jeremy.

01:02:46.371 --> 01:02:48.305
If this is some sick way
of trying to get me back,

01:02:48.329 --> 01:02:49.611
you could just give us back
our cellphones

01:02:49.635 --> 01:02:51.918
and get the hell out of here.

01:02:54.901 --> 01:02:56.661
Is he dead?

01:02:56.685 --> 01:02:59.273
Is he dead? Oh, my God!

01:03:02.561 --> 01:03:03.823
Oh, no!
Oh, my God!

01:03:14.486 --> 01:03:15.985
Oh, my God!

01:03:16.009 --> 01:03:17.706
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

01:04:04.753 --> 01:04:06.470
Let's go out the back door.

01:04:06.494 --> 01:04:08.211
No, we tied it, remember?

01:04:08.235 --> 01:04:09.541
That way, that way.

01:04:13.197 --> 01:04:14.502
What do we do?

01:04:22.946 --> 01:04:24.817
Come on.

01:04:28.386 --> 01:04:29.953
Who the hell was that?
I don't know.

01:04:31.041 --> 01:04:34.629
He, he killed Jeremy.

01:04:34.653 --> 01:04:36.500
Do you think he was
the creepy pizza guy?

01:04:36.524 --> 01:04:37.806
I mean, damn,
did you leave a tip?

01:04:37.830 --> 01:04:39.025
Toby, get down here!

01:04:39.049 --> 01:04:41.810
No, we need to use this thing.

01:04:41.834 --> 01:04:44.073
And block all the doors, okay?
No, we need to get Toby.

01:04:44.097 --> 01:04:45.466
We need to get out of here
right now.

01:04:45.490 --> 01:04:47.250
What?

01:04:47.274 --> 01:04:50.297
You wanna go out there
where he's at? Oh, hell no.

01:04:50.321 --> 01:04:52.255
If he wants to,
he can come back in, Kaci.

01:04:52.279 --> 01:04:53.996
We cannot stay here.
Do you understand?

01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:56.433
Okay. Fine.

01:04:56.457 --> 01:04:59.001
I'mma go get my keys
in the purse in the kitchen.

01:04:59.025 --> 01:05:00.176
Okay.
All right.

01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:03.179
I'll get Toby. Toby? Toby?

01:05:03.203 --> 01:05:04.552
Toby?

01:05:08.078 --> 01:05:09.209
Toby?

01:05:32.667 --> 01:05:34.123
Toby, Shh.

01:05:34.147 --> 01:05:35.975
I need you to not make
one noise, okay?

01:05:37.063 --> 01:05:38.021
Okay?

01:05:47.204 --> 01:05:48.877
Okay. Come here,
come here, come here.

01:05:48.901 --> 01:05:50.531
We gotta hide. Come here.

01:05:50.555 --> 01:05:53.316
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on.

01:05:53.340 --> 01:05:55.255
Get down, get down.
No, no, right here, right here.

01:07:05.108 --> 01:07:06.326
Shoot!

01:07:34.789 --> 01:07:35.747
Ah!

01:07:43.668 --> 01:07:44.625
Ah!

01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:51.434
The best you got, huh?

01:07:51.458 --> 01:07:52.807
Come on.

01:07:57.334 --> 01:07:59.031
Hey!

01:08:22.576 --> 01:08:23.751
No.

01:08:36.372 --> 01:08:38.524
Toby, we can't stay here, okay?

01:08:38.549 --> 01:08:40.439
We gotta find a way
out of here, okay?

01:08:40.464 --> 01:08:41.421
Okay.

01:08:43.423 --> 01:08:45.773
Follow me, all right?
All right. Stay close. Come on.

01:09:02.573 --> 01:09:03.965
Up, up, up, up, up.

01:09:05.053 --> 01:09:06.683
Quiet. Quiet.

01:09:06.707 --> 01:09:08.946
Shut it, shut it, shut it.
Okay.

01:09:08.970 --> 01:09:09.928
Okay.

01:09:19.242 --> 01:09:21.481
Toby, do your parents
have a gun?

01:09:21.505 --> 01:09:23.462
We are in Toluca Lake.
What do you think?

01:09:27.424 --> 01:09:29.576
Didn't you say he had a knife?

01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:30.557
Yeah.

01:09:42.569 --> 01:09:44.460
Okay, Toby, is there
another way down

01:09:44.484 --> 01:09:45.461
besides the front staircase?

01:09:45.484 --> 01:09:47.288
Um, uh...

01:09:47.313 --> 01:09:49.725
I-I have a fire ladder
in my room, but I can't go down.

01:09:49.750 --> 01:09:50.988
I only practiced one time
and I freaked out.

01:09:51.011 --> 01:09:52.642
No, no, no, no. It's okay.

01:09:52.666 --> 01:09:54.122
I'm gonna be with you
the entire time, okay?

01:09:54.145 --> 01:09:55.471
We're just gonna figure
out a way to get back

01:09:55.495 --> 01:09:57.038
to your room, okay?

01:09:57.062 --> 01:09:59.195
Okay.

01:10:09.422 --> 01:10:11.531
I need you to go
into the bathroom closet,

01:10:11.555 --> 01:10:13.837
close the door and talk into
the walkie, protect your voice.

01:10:13.861 --> 01:10:15.404
No, no, no, I can't, I can't...
Listen, listen, listen.

01:10:15.428 --> 01:10:17.406
Listen to me, Toby,
the other walkie is in my room.

01:10:17.430 --> 01:10:19.756
If he hears that, maybe he'll
go there instead, okay?

01:10:19.780 --> 01:10:22.194
I don't want you to leave me.

01:10:22.218 --> 01:10:24.587
Toby, I will never leave you.

01:10:24.611 --> 01:10:25.612
I promise.

01:10:39.104 --> 01:10:40.888
You can do it.
You can do it.

01:10:58.950 --> 01:11:00.865
He's coming
for us. We have to hide!

01:11:08.264 --> 01:11:09.763
Toby, Toby, Toby, come here.

01:11:09.787 --> 01:11:12.200
It worked. Good job, okay?

01:11:12.224 --> 01:11:14.376
Now, once he figures out that
we're not in there

01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:15.769
he's gonna come back here,
so we gotta be quick

01:11:15.793 --> 01:11:17.161
and we gotta be quiet.

01:11:17.185 --> 01:11:18.119
Are you ready?

01:11:18.143 --> 01:11:19.425
You can do it. You can do it.

01:11:19.449 --> 01:11:20.406
Okay.

01:11:25.193 --> 01:11:27.650
All right. Wait, wait.

01:11:27.674 --> 01:11:28.675
Okay. Go.

01:11:35.421 --> 01:11:38.400
Is that the ladder?
Okay. All right.

01:11:38.424 --> 01:11:40.359
Come on. Here.
I got it. I got it.

01:11:44.691 --> 01:11:46.737
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

01:11:49.522 --> 01:11:51.848
Be careful. Quickly. Quickly.

01:11:51.872 --> 01:11:54.547
Careful. Careful.

01:11:54.571 --> 01:11:55.852
Okay, come on.
Come on, come on.

01:11:55.876 --> 01:11:57.661
You got it?
Okay. Here. Take this.

01:11:58.662 --> 01:12:00.814
Okay, come on, come on.

01:12:00.838 --> 01:12:02.535
Okay, let's go. Let's go.

01:12:04.015 --> 01:12:04.972
Ho!

01:12:05.886 --> 01:12:06.844
Shhh.

01:12:13.546 --> 01:12:15.331
Okay, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go.

01:12:34.785 --> 01:12:37.372
Okay. You're gonna
get on the ladder first.

01:12:37.396 --> 01:12:39.137
Then I'm gonna
go right behind you, okay?

01:12:41.182 --> 01:12:44.205
I can't, I can't, I can't do it.

01:12:44.229 --> 01:12:46.207
What? What? Toby? Toby?

01:12:46.231 --> 01:12:48.427
Yes, you can. Listen to me.

01:12:48.451 --> 01:12:50.167
I have staff kids
coming to the hospital

01:12:50.191 --> 01:12:52.431
who are hurt, who are injured,

01:12:52.455 --> 01:12:55.695
and you are so much
braver than any of them, okay?

01:12:55.719 --> 01:12:57.784
Hey, look. All right?

01:12:57.808 --> 01:13:00.003
I'm gonna be with you every step
of the way, all right?

01:13:00.027 --> 01:13:01.527
I'm gonna walk you through it.

01:13:01.551 --> 01:13:03.137
You're gonna get on that ladder

01:13:03.161 --> 01:13:05.835
and we're gonna go
step by step together.

01:13:05.859 --> 01:13:07.924
Okay?

01:13:07.948 --> 01:13:10.144
Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Listen.

01:13:10.168 --> 01:13:11.493
I promised your mother
that I wasn't gonna

01:13:11.517 --> 01:13:13.408
let anything happen to you.

01:13:13.432 --> 01:13:15.497
And I meant that.

01:13:15.521 --> 01:13:18.108
Okay? I got you.

01:13:18.132 --> 01:13:20.415
I'll take care of you, okay?
We got this.

01:13:20.439 --> 01:13:23.636
Yeah? Yeah? Okay. Okay.

01:13:23.660 --> 01:13:26.290
Toby, are you okay?

01:13:26.314 --> 01:13:28.467
I-I don't feel very good.

01:13:29.709 --> 01:13:31.470
You're getting hypoglycemic.

01:13:31.494 --> 01:13:33.820
Okay. Okay. It's all right.

01:13:33.844 --> 01:13:35.212
Do you think you can
make it down the ladder

01:13:35.236 --> 01:13:36.257
without fainting?

01:13:36.281 --> 01:13:37.867
Yeah?
I think so.

01:13:37.891 --> 01:13:39.173
You need to be strong, Toby,
okay?

01:13:39.197 --> 01:13:40.217
Okay.
You can do this, all right?

01:13:40.241 --> 01:13:41.504
Okay.
Okay.

01:13:54.081 --> 01:13:55.624
Okay. Okay. Yeah.

01:13:55.648 --> 01:13:57.911
Okay. I got you. I got you.

01:14:06.485 --> 01:14:08.028
All right, all right.
We're gonna go step by step.

01:14:08.052 --> 01:14:09.532
Yeah.
Okay.

01:14:10.881 --> 01:14:12.293
Step down. Come on.

01:14:12.317 --> 01:14:14.513
Yeah. There you go.

01:14:14.537 --> 01:14:16.190
There you go.
Hold it tightly.

01:14:17.409 --> 01:14:19.648
Come on.

01:14:19.672 --> 01:14:21.520
I got you. I got you.

01:14:21.544 --> 01:14:24.436
Okay. One more step.
Okay. Easy. Easy.

01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:26.307
Okay?
Step down. Come on down.

01:14:26.331 --> 01:14:27.375
Okay. Okay.

01:14:28.289 --> 01:14:29.856
All right.

01:14:32.511 --> 01:14:33.773
Little to the left.

01:14:51.661 --> 01:14:52.966
Okay. Come on.

01:15:02.628 --> 01:15:03.586
Careful.

01:15:04.587 --> 01:15:07.130
All right.

01:15:07.154 --> 01:15:09.330
Come on. Over here.
Over here. Come on.

01:15:12.638 --> 01:15:14.814
Okay. Okay.
Kaci car. Kaci car. Come on.

01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:20.230
Okay. All right. Get in.

01:15:20.254 --> 01:15:21.928
Get in.

01:15:21.952 --> 01:15:24.321
Okay. Stay right here.
I'll be right back.

01:15:24.345 --> 01:15:26.173
I have to get the keys. Okay.

01:15:42.538 --> 01:15:43.495
Kaci?

01:15:44.975 --> 01:15:45.932
Kaci?

01:15:52.243 --> 01:15:53.287
Kaci?

01:15:57.465 --> 01:15:58.423
Kaci?

01:15:59.729 --> 01:16:00.817
Kaci?

01:16:03.515 --> 01:16:04.472
Kaci?

01:16:07.214 --> 01:16:08.781
K-Kaci?

01:16:10.870 --> 01:16:12.718
Kaci, I'm so sorry!

01:16:17.790 --> 01:16:19.202
Karen?
Daphne.

01:16:19.226 --> 01:16:20.813
Why haven't you been
answering my calls?

01:16:20.837 --> 01:16:21.770
I've been calling you since...
Karen.

01:16:21.794 --> 01:16:22.858
Karen, listen to me.

01:16:22.882 --> 01:16:24.294
We were attacked.

01:16:24.318 --> 01:16:25.861
What?
Toby is fine.

01:16:25.885 --> 01:16:27.297
But I need to get him
his insulin shot, okay?

01:16:27.321 --> 01:16:28.908
I need you to call the police.

01:16:28.932 --> 01:16:30.126
What, what
do you mean "attacked?"

01:16:30.150 --> 01:16:31.432
Karen, I have to get
back to the car

01:16:31.456 --> 01:16:33.652
but two people are already dead.

01:16:33.676 --> 01:16:36.785
The killer's...

01:16:36.809 --> 01:16:39.222
Karen, call the police.

01:16:39.246 --> 01:16:41.094
Now.

01:16:41.118 --> 01:16:42.946
I have to go.

01:16:45.122 --> 01:16:46.906
They're never gonna
make it on time.

01:16:48.429 --> 01:16:49.929
Audra?

01:16:49.953 --> 01:16:51.694
Audra Monrose.

01:16:53.086 --> 01:16:55.412
You're his mother.

01:16:55.436 --> 01:16:57.656
Go on. You can say his name.

01:17:03.357 --> 01:17:05.771
Say his name!

01:17:05.795 --> 01:17:08.512
Mason.

01:17:08.536 --> 01:17:12.168
I thought his mother was...
You thought I was dead.

01:17:12.192 --> 01:17:14.301
Well, that's what his father
tells everyone.

01:17:14.325 --> 01:17:17.521
Only because he wishes
I were dead.

01:17:17.545 --> 01:17:19.175
What do you mean?

01:17:19.199 --> 01:17:20.505
Well, it's simple.

01:17:21.854 --> 01:17:23.745
My son was taken from me

01:17:23.769 --> 01:17:24.727
twice.

01:17:25.989 --> 01:17:28.184
Once, from my ex-husband,

01:17:28.208 --> 01:17:30.099
and now from all of you.

01:17:30.123 --> 01:17:32.014
Mason's dad was a sweetheart.

01:17:32.038 --> 01:17:34.495
I used to think so, too

01:17:34.519 --> 01:17:37.063
until I found him messing around
with a babysitter one night

01:17:37.087 --> 01:17:39.631
when I came home early.

01:17:39.655 --> 01:17:41.482
Perhaps, you've heard of her.

01:17:42.788 --> 01:17:44.442
Her name is Claire Carven.

01:17:45.225 --> 01:17:48.988
Well... it was.

01:17:49.012 --> 01:17:50.903
The babysitter from the news.

01:17:50.927 --> 01:17:52.513
Yeah.

01:17:52.537 --> 01:17:56.691
Everyone thought she was
so sweet and so perfect,

01:17:56.715 --> 01:17:59.476
just like everyone mistakenly
thought of you.

01:17:59.500 --> 01:18:01.130
No. Audra, listen to me.

01:18:01.154 --> 01:18:03.219
I need you to understand
I am not responsible

01:18:03.243 --> 01:18:05.352
for the death of your son.

01:18:05.376 --> 01:18:08.268
Okay? I was asked
to do something by my superior.

01:18:08.292 --> 01:18:09.661
And your son's vitals were fine

01:18:09.685 --> 01:18:11.793
the last I checked on him,
I promise.

01:18:11.817 --> 01:18:14.100
You don't believe it was
your duty whatsoever

01:18:14.124 --> 01:18:17.320
to make sure my son was okay

01:18:17.344 --> 01:18:20.062
even though you were the nurse
on duty the night he died?

01:18:20.086 --> 01:18:22.195
I am so sorry
for the loss of your son.

01:18:22.219 --> 01:18:23.762
And if I had known
that my boss was gonna

01:18:23.786 --> 01:18:25.589
step away from the monitor
when he did,

01:18:25.613 --> 01:18:27.896
I would have never
left my post, okay?

01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:29.855
I never intended
for any of that to happen

01:18:29.879 --> 01:18:31.726
to your son, I promise.

01:18:31.750 --> 01:18:34.337
Well, I never intended
on trying to poison my husband

01:18:34.361 --> 01:18:36.731
after he cheated on me.

01:18:36.755 --> 01:18:38.820
But...

01:18:38.844 --> 01:18:40.822
we all have to reap
the consequences of the actions

01:18:40.846 --> 01:18:42.718
we take every day nonetheless.

01:18:44.545 --> 01:18:45.871
Now, don't we?

01:18:45.895 --> 01:18:47.766
Oh, God!

01:19:08.569 --> 01:19:10.243
Audra! Audra, please.

01:19:10.267 --> 01:19:12.898
I know how much you must've
loved your son, Mason,

01:19:12.922 --> 01:19:14.334
but do you really think
this is what he would've

01:19:14.358 --> 01:19:15.988
wanted his mother to become?

01:19:16.012 --> 01:19:19.208
You have no idea
what my son would've wanted.

01:19:19.232 --> 01:19:22.298
And you have no clue
how much I loved him.

01:19:22.322 --> 01:19:23.909
But you will now.

01:19:27.980 --> 01:19:30.829
You should never be responsible

01:19:30.853 --> 01:19:33.962
for taking care
of another child ever!

01:19:33.986 --> 01:19:36.835
Yeah? Well, neither should you.

01:20:14.157 --> 01:20:15.114
Toby?

01:20:15.811 --> 01:20:16.962
Toby?

01:20:16.986 --> 01:20:19.181
Okay. Stay with me.

01:20:19.205 --> 01:20:20.704
Do you hear me?

01:20:20.728 --> 01:20:22.663
Do you hear me? Okay.

01:20:22.687 --> 01:20:24.558
All right. I got you.
I got you right here, Toby.

01:20:25.821 --> 01:20:26.778
Okay.

01:20:28.171 --> 01:20:29.825
Okay. All right. All right.

01:20:31.217 --> 01:20:32.978
Okay.

01:20:33.002 --> 01:20:35.482
Yeah? Yeah?

01:20:36.919 --> 01:20:37.939
What took you so long?

01:20:39.747 --> 01:20:41.508
Okay. All right.
Let's get you out of here.

01:20:41.532 --> 01:20:42.838
Okay. All right.

01:20:45.405 --> 01:20:47.688
Daphne, behind you!

01:20:47.712 --> 01:20:49.733
Ah!

01:20:49.757 --> 01:20:51.344
Daphne!

01:20:51.368 --> 01:20:52.325
Ah!

01:21:16.132 --> 01:21:18.003
No. No. No!

01:21:20.005 --> 01:21:21.504
Daphne!

01:21:21.528 --> 01:21:24.725
I only wanted to protect my son.

01:21:24.749 --> 01:21:27.099
And you took that away from me!

01:21:46.597 --> 01:21:48.575
Are you okay?
Oh!

01:21:48.599 --> 01:21:50.906
Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay. Yeah.

01:21:51.602 --> 01:21:54.363
I'm okay.

01:22:36.342 --> 01:22:37.624
Daphne!

01:22:37.648 --> 01:22:39.955
Hey, kid! Oh!

01:22:40.781 --> 01:22:42.411
Check it out.

01:22:42.435 --> 01:22:44.065
Is that the monitoring system?

01:22:44.089 --> 01:22:46.198
Yup.
That's incredible!

01:22:46.222 --> 01:22:48.026
You're in business, kid.

01:22:48.050 --> 01:22:49.592
Bet your parents paid
a pretty penny

01:22:49.616 --> 01:22:51.812
for that cool new
security system.

01:22:51.836 --> 01:22:53.379
We paid for the materials.
Oh.

01:22:53.403 --> 01:22:55.381
And I'm sure someday
we'll be paying

01:22:55.405 --> 01:22:57.122
for this one's first
business startup.

01:22:57.146 --> 01:22:59.515
How are you?
I'm good.

01:22:59.539 --> 01:23:00.952
Are you all packed up?

01:23:00.976 --> 01:23:03.302
Yeah, I'm gonna head out
in about an hour.

01:23:03.326 --> 01:23:06.087
Well, Los Angeles is losing
one of its finest nurses.

01:23:06.111 --> 01:23:08.568
Well, hopefully Atlanta feels
the same way about gaining one.

01:23:08.592 --> 01:23:11.919
You're not gonna be a nurse
for much longer, are you?

01:23:11.943 --> 01:23:15.967
You know you always have a place
to stay when you come visit.

01:23:15.991 --> 01:23:19.883
In case, perhaps, you decide
to do residency here even.

01:23:19.907 --> 01:23:21.885
Thank you, Karen.
It's very sweet of you.

01:23:21.909 --> 01:23:24.192
Well, I-I mean,
do you have to leave now?

01:23:24.216 --> 01:23:26.238
We ordered lunch.

01:23:26.262 --> 01:23:28.525
And it'd be really nice
if you could stay.

01:23:30.309 --> 01:23:32.287
Yeah, I think I could
stick around.

01:23:32.311 --> 01:23:34.183
Great. Come on.

01:23:35.967 --> 01:23:37.640
Also, today is my cheat day.

01:23:37.664 --> 01:23:39.120
So we got milkshakes, too.

01:23:39.144 --> 01:23:41.383
Birthday cake milkshakes?

01:23:41.407 --> 01:23:42.689
Duh.

01:23:44.802 --> 01:23:46.630
Y-you know, it's a real bummer
you're leaving.

01:23:48.458 --> 01:23:50.610
Maybe someday if I'm not
too afraid of flying,

01:23:50.634 --> 01:23:51.828
I'll come visit.

01:23:51.852 --> 01:23:54.005
I'd love that.

01:23:54.029 --> 01:23:56.442
And, hey, it seems like
you're already halfway there.

01:23:56.466 --> 01:23:58.487
There's a big difference
between a second story

01:23:58.511 --> 01:24:00.359
and a flight's maximum height.

01:24:00.383 --> 01:24:03.168
Either way,
I'll be back some day.

01:24:05.823 --> 01:24:07.714
Do you think by the time
you get back we'd be too old

01:24:07.738 --> 01:24:09.411
for birthday cake milkshakes?

01:24:09.435 --> 01:24:11.109
Toby, one can never be too old

01:24:11.133 --> 01:24:13.004
for birthday cake milkshakes.
