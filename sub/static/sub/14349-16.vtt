00:14.738 --> 00:16.672
Anything from the landing party?

00:16.740 --> 00:19.004
They should be sending up
a report momentarily.

00:19.075 --> 00:21.168
Ohh.

00:21.244 --> 00:22.438
Something wrong?

00:22.512 --> 00:24.446
A kink in my back.

00:24.514 --> 00:25.674
That's it.

00:25.749 --> 00:27.182
A little higher, please.

00:27.250 --> 00:28.683
Push. Push hard.

00:28.752 --> 00:30.686
Dig it in there, Mr. Sp--

00:32.255 --> 00:35.019
Thank you, Yeoman.
That's sufficient.

00:35.091 --> 00:36.524
You need sleep, Captain.

00:36.593 --> 00:39.027
If it's not out of line--

00:39.095 --> 00:42.030
I have enough of that from Dr. McCoy.
Thank you.

00:42.098 --> 00:43.531
Dr. McCoy is correct.

00:43.600 --> 00:46.194
After what this ship has been through
in the last three months,

00:46.269 --> 00:49.033
there is not a crewman aboard
who is not in need of rest,

00:49.105 --> 00:50.538
my self excepted, of course.

00:56.780 --> 00:58.213
Have Dr. McCoy's report

00:58.281 --> 01:00.215
channeled to my quarters,
Lieutenant.

01:00.283 --> 01:01.648
Aye, aye, Captain.

01:19.402 --> 01:20.835
Beautiful,

01:20.904 --> 01:22.565
beautiful.

01:22.639 --> 01:23.833
No animals.

01:23.907 --> 01:25.169
No people.

01:25.242 --> 01:27.176
No worries.

01:27.244 --> 01:29.178
Just what the doctor ordered,

01:29.246 --> 01:30.338
right, Doctor?

01:30.413 --> 01:33.507
I couldn't have
prescribed better.

01:33.583 --> 01:35.676
We are one weary ship.

01:35.752 --> 01:38.516
Think the captain will authorize
shore leave here?

01:38.588 --> 01:42.684
Depending upon my report and that
of the other scouting parties.

01:42.759 --> 01:46.024
You know, you have to see
this place to believe it.

01:46.096 --> 01:49.031
It's like something out of
Alice in Wonderland.

01:49.099 --> 01:51.363
The captain has to come down.

01:51.434 --> 01:52.867
He'd like it.

01:52.936 --> 01:54.369
He needs it.

01:54.437 --> 01:56.871
You've got your problems.
I've got mine.

01:56.940 --> 02:00.034
He's got ours plus his
plus 430 other people.

02:03.046 --> 02:04.479
Where are you going?

02:04.547 --> 02:06.811
To get some cell-structure records.

02:06.883 --> 02:09.818
A blade of grass,
a bush, a tree,

02:09.886 --> 02:11.478
a flower petal.

02:11.554 --> 02:15.285
With these, we can tell
the whole planet biology.

02:23.733 --> 02:26.566
Oh, my paws and whiskers!

02:26.636 --> 02:28.729
I'll be late.

02:36.880 --> 02:38.313
Excuse me, sir.

02:38.381 --> 02:41.145
Have you seen
a rather large white rabbit

02:41.217 --> 02:44.152
with a yellow waistcoat
and white gloves here about?

02:47.524 --> 02:49.219
Thank you very much.

02:54.898 --> 02:56.832
Sulu!

03:02.172 --> 03:04.606
What is it?

03:04.674 --> 03:06.608
What's the matter?

03:06.676 --> 03:08.109
Did you see them?

03:09.512 --> 03:11.036
See what?

03:13.116 --> 03:14.845
I don't see anything.

03:17.354 --> 03:18.787
What is it, Doc?

03:29.532 --> 03:33.468
Space--
the final frontier.

03:33.536 --> 03:36.972
These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise.

03:37.040 --> 03:38.837
Its five-year mission--

03:38.908 --> 03:42.309
to explore strange new worlds...

03:42.379 --> 03:45.576
to seek out new life
and new civilizations...

03:45.648 --> 03:49.607
to boldly go where
no man has gone before.

04:23.219 --> 04:24.481
Captain 's log.

04:24.554 --> 04:29.491
Stardate 3025... uh, .3.

04:29.559 --> 04:31.618
We are orbiting
an uninhabited planet

04:31.694 --> 04:33.628
in the Omicron Delta region,

04:33.696 --> 04:35.630
a planet remarkably like Earth

04:35.698 --> 04:38.132
or how we remember Earth to be--

04:38.201 --> 04:40.669
park like, beautiful, green,

04:40.737 --> 04:43.638
flowers, trees, green lawn,

04:43.706 --> 04:45.298
quiet and restful,

04:45.375 --> 04:47.809
almost too good to be true.

04:47.877 --> 04:50.311
Sir, I don't see your name

04:50.380 --> 04:52.814
in any ofthe shore parties.

04:52.882 --> 04:54.816
I may be tired, Yeoman,

04:54.884 --> 04:56.749
but I'm not falling apart.

04:56.820 --> 04:58.082
Dismissed.

04:58.154 --> 04:59.587
Aye, aye, sir.

04:59.656 --> 05:02.591
Shore-leave party one,
standby your section.

05:02.659 --> 05:05.093
You willbe called
in alphabetical order.

05:05.161 --> 05:08.096
Mr. Spock, we're beaming down
the starboard section first.

05:08.164 --> 05:11.099
Which section would you
like to go with?

05:11.167 --> 05:13.601
Not necessary in my case, Captain.

05:13.670 --> 05:15.103
On my planet,

05:15.171 --> 05:17.105
"to rest" is to rest,

05:17.173 --> 05:18.606
to cease using energy.

05:18.675 --> 05:21.109
To me it is quite illogical

05:21.177 --> 05:24.112
to run up and down
on green grass using energy

05:24.180 --> 05:25.613
instead of saving it.

05:25.682 --> 05:27.115
[Intercom Whistles]

05:27.183 --> 05:28.445
Kirk here.

05:28.518 --> 05:30.952
Dr. McCoy calling
from the planet, Captain.

05:31.020 --> 05:32.453
Open a channel, Uhura.

05:32.522 --> 05:33.887
Aye, aye, sir.

05:33.957 --> 05:35.788
Captain, are you beaming down?

05:35.859 --> 05:37.451
I hadn't planned to. Why?

05:38.895 --> 05:42.592
Well, either our scouting probes
and detectors

05:42.665 --> 05:44.098
are malfunctioning

05:44.167 --> 05:48.604
and all us scouts careless
and beauty-intoxicated,

05:48.671 --> 05:51.970
or I must report myself
unfit for duty.

05:53.176 --> 05:55.303
Explain.

05:55.378 --> 06:00.042
On this supposedly
uninhabited planet,

06:00.116 --> 06:02.812
I just saw a large rabbit

06:02.886 --> 06:06.447
pull a gold watch from his vest
and claim that he was late.

06:06.523 --> 06:08.855
That's pretty good.
I got one for you.

06:08.925 --> 06:12.190
The rabbit was followed
by a little blond girl, right?

06:12.262 --> 06:14.492
As a matter of fact, yes,

06:14.564 --> 06:18.261
and they disappeared
through a hole in a hedge.

06:18.334 --> 06:19.767
All right, Doctor,

06:19.836 --> 06:23.602
I'll take your report
under consideration.

06:23.673 --> 06:24.765
Captain out.

06:24.841 --> 06:26.741
That's a McCoy pill

06:26.809 --> 06:30.905
with a little...
mystery sugar coating.

06:30.980 --> 06:33.574
He wants to get me down there.
Afraid I won't swallow it.

06:33.650 --> 06:35.083
Very well, Captain.

06:35.151 --> 06:37.585
Something I did
come to discuss.

06:37.654 --> 06:40.418
Yes, Mr. Spock, what is it?

06:40.490 --> 06:43.254
I picked this up
from Dr. McCoy's log.

06:43.326 --> 06:45.590
We have a crew member aboard

06:45.662 --> 06:48.096
who's showing signs
of stress and fatigue--

06:48.164 --> 06:49.597
reaction time down 9-12%,

06:49.666 --> 06:51.759
associational reading norm minus 3.

06:51.834 --> 06:53.267
That's much too low.

06:53.336 --> 06:55.270
He's becoming irritable
and quarrelsome,

06:55.338 --> 06:58.034
yet he refuses to take
rest and rehabilitation.

06:58.107 --> 06:59.540
He has that right, but--

06:59.609 --> 07:02.908
A crewman's right ends
where the safety of the ship begins.

07:02.979 --> 07:05.573
That man will go a shore on my orders.
What's his name?

07:05.648 --> 07:07.707
"James Kirk."

07:10.019 --> 07:11.611
Enjoy yourself, Captain.

07:11.688 --> 07:13.121
It's an interesting planet.

07:13.189 --> 07:15.089
You'll fi nd it quite pleasant,

07:15.158 --> 07:16.921
very much like your Earth.

07:16.993 --> 07:20.087
Scouts have detected
no animals, artifacts,

07:20.163 --> 07:22.597
or force fields of any kind,

07:22.665 --> 07:26.601
only peace, sunshine,
and good air.

07:26.669 --> 07:29.229
You'll have no problems.

07:39.682 --> 07:42.617
Always have to be work with you?

07:42.685 --> 07:44.619
So much love liness.

07:44.687 --> 07:47.121
You won't find
all this so lovely

07:47.190 --> 07:49.624
if our report for the captain

07:49.692 --> 07:52.126
isn't ready when he asks for it,

07:52.195 --> 07:53.787
which shouldn't be long.

08:11.714 --> 08:14.080
Rodriguez, Teller,
everything all right?

08:14.150 --> 08:15.242
Yes, sir.

08:15.318 --> 08:17.252
We've completed
the specimen survey.

08:17.320 --> 08:18.753
That should be sufficient.

08:18.821 --> 08:21.255
Beam it up to Mr. Spock

08:21.324 --> 08:22.757
and start enjoying yourselves.

08:22.825 --> 08:26.090
Sir, I think you'll find Dr. McCoy
and Mr. Sulu that way.

08:26.162 --> 08:27.288
Thank you.

08:30.833 --> 08:32.061
Restful.

08:32.135 --> 08:34.068
After what we've been through,

08:34.136 --> 08:35.570
it's hard to believe

08:35.638 --> 08:37.572
a place this beautiful exists.

08:37.640 --> 08:39.573
It is beautiful, so lovely,

08:39.642 --> 08:42.076
and restful.

08:42.145 --> 08:44.340
I mean, affirmative, Captain.

08:46.149 --> 08:48.413
McCoy!

08:48.484 --> 08:49.576
McCoy!

08:49.652 --> 08:51.244
Over here.

08:51.320 --> 08:52.412
Over here.

09:02.165 --> 09:06.431
Bones, know any good
rabbit jokes lately?

09:06.502 --> 09:08.493
As a matter offact, I do,

09:08.571 --> 09:10.505
but this is not
one ofthem.

09:10.573 --> 09:12.006
Look at this.

09:12.075 --> 09:13.838
I saw what I saw,

09:13.910 --> 09:15.844
or maybe I hallucinated it,

09:15.912 --> 09:18.847
but I want you to take a look
and tell me what you think.

09:18.915 --> 09:20.143
Footprints.

09:27.023 --> 09:29.150
Could be a rabbit.

09:29.225 --> 09:33.855
It would have to be
an unusual creature

09:33.930 --> 09:36.023
to make this size tracks.

09:39.936 --> 09:42.905
What about Mr. Sulu?
Will he confirm what you saw?

09:42.972 --> 09:45.338
Negative.
He was examining the flora.

09:45.408 --> 09:46.875
[Beeping]

09:46.943 --> 09:48.740
Bridge, this is the Captain.

09:48.811 --> 09:50.244
Where is Mr. Sulu?

09:50.313 --> 09:51.405
Collecting specimens.

09:51.481 --> 09:52.573
Bridge.

09:52.648 --> 09:55.048
Has the first shore party
beamed down yet?

09:55.118 --> 09:56.551
They're just about to start.

09:56.619 --> 09:58.052
Get this message.

09:58.121 --> 10:00.885
Stand by.
No one is to leave the ship.

10:00.957 --> 10:02.754
Aye, aye, sir.

10:02.825 --> 10:04.122
You're canceling shore leave

10:04.193 --> 10:05.626
on account of this?

10:05.695 --> 10:07.686
Can you explain this?

10:07.764 --> 10:09.231
Well, no, but...

10:09.298 --> 10:10.731
Neither can I.

10:10.800 --> 10:12.563
I admit it looks harmless.

10:12.635 --> 10:14.068
Probably is harmless,

10:14.137 --> 10:16.901
but before I bring
my people down here,

10:16.973 --> 10:18.736
I want proofit's harmless.

10:18.808 --> 10:19.797
[Gunshot]

10:27.950 --> 10:28.974
[Gunshot]

10:35.158 --> 10:36.284
[Gunshot]

10:43.065 --> 10:45.431
What do you think you're doing?

10:45.501 --> 10:46.934
Target shooting, Captain.

10:47.003 --> 10:48.664
Isn't it a beauty?

10:48.738 --> 10:51.104
Haven't got anything like this
in my collection.

10:51.174 --> 10:52.971
Where did you get it?

10:53.042 --> 10:54.475
I found it.

10:54.544 --> 10:55.977
It's a crazy coincidence,

10:56.045 --> 10:58.377
but I've always wanted
one like this.

10:58.447 --> 11:00.381
Found it lying over there--

11:00.449 --> 11:02.383
an old-time police special,

11:02.451 --> 11:03.884
and in beautiful condition.

11:03.953 --> 11:06.387
Hasn't been one like this made

11:06.455 --> 11:08.889
in, oh, a couple centuries.

11:11.928 --> 11:13.054
Mr. Sulu.

11:14.430 --> 11:15.863
It fi res lead pellets

11:15.932 --> 11:17.365
propelled by expanding gases

11:17.433 --> 11:19.264
from a chemical explosion.

11:21.604 --> 11:23.765
I'll hang on to it.

11:23.840 --> 11:26.741
The fresh air seems to
have made you trigger-happy.

11:26.809 --> 11:28.242
Dr. McCoy's rabbit, sir,

11:28.311 --> 11:30.211
he must have gone
through here.

11:32.481 --> 11:34.415
Are you sure our instruments

11:34.483 --> 11:37.418
didn't show any animal life
on this planet?

11:37.486 --> 11:38.578
Absolutely.

11:38.654 --> 11:41.088
No birds, no mammals,
no insects--nothing.

11:41.157 --> 11:43.591
I'm certain our readings
weren't off.

11:43.659 --> 11:47.095
I'd like to believe
this is an elaborate gag, but...

11:47.163 --> 11:49.757
Yeoman Barrows, accompany Mr. Sulu.

11:49.832 --> 11:52.130
Find out where
those tracks came from.

11:52.201 --> 11:55.136
Doctor, come with me
back to the glade.

11:55.204 --> 11:57.365
I'd like another look
at that area.

12:21.964 --> 12:24.899
This is turning out to be
one very unusual shore leave.

12:24.967 --> 12:26.730
It could have been worse.

12:26.802 --> 12:27.894
How?

12:27.970 --> 12:30.404
You could have
seen the rabbit.

12:30.473 --> 12:32.907
What's the matter,
getting a persecution complex?

12:32.975 --> 12:35.409
Well, I'm beginning
to feel picked on.

12:35.478 --> 12:36.911
I know the feeling.

12:36.979 --> 12:39.243
I had it at the academy.

12:39.315 --> 12:40.748
An upper classman there--

12:40.816 --> 12:42.750
one practical joke after another

12:42.818 --> 12:44.251
and always on me--

12:44.320 --> 12:45.753
my own personal devil,

12:45.821 --> 12:48.255
a guy by the name of Finnegan.

12:48.324 --> 12:50.758
And you being
the very serious young--

12:50.826 --> 12:52.760
Serious?
I was absolutely grim,

12:52.828 --> 12:54.762
which delighted Finnegan no end.

12:54.830 --> 12:57.697
He's the kind of guy
to put cold soup in your bed

12:57.767 --> 13:00.702
or a bucket ofwater
propped over a door.

13:00.770 --> 13:03.705
You never knew
where he'd strike next.

13:03.773 --> 13:05.070
More tracks.

13:06.442 --> 13:09.878
Looks like your rabbit
came from over there.

13:09.946 --> 13:12.710
A girl's footprints.

13:12.782 --> 13:15.717
The young blond girl
I saw chase him.

13:15.785 --> 13:16.877
Yes.

13:16.953 --> 13:18.420
You follow the rabbit.

13:20.423 --> 13:21.856
I'll backtrack the girl.

13:21.924 --> 13:25.382
I'll meet you around
the other side ofthe hill.

13:25.461 --> 13:26.723
Good.

13:26.796 --> 13:29.594
I got a personal grudge
against that rabbit.

13:36.973 --> 13:38.736
Jim.

13:41.978 --> 13:43.138
Finnegan?

13:44.480 --> 13:46.414
I can't believe it.

13:49.485 --> 13:52.420
You never know when
I'm going to strike,

13:52.488 --> 13:53.921
huh,Jim?

13:53.990 --> 13:56.356
Ha ha ha ha!
How's this?

14:01.397 --> 14:04.855
Come on, come on.
It's me, Finnegan.

14:04.934 --> 14:07.198
All right,Jimmy boy.

14:07.269 --> 14:08.702
Ha ha ha ha!

14:08.771 --> 14:12.138
Whoo-ha ha ha ha!

14:12.208 --> 14:13.698
Lay one on me.

14:13.776 --> 14:15.710
That's what you always wanted,

14:15.778 --> 14:18.178
isn't it?

14:18.247 --> 14:20.909
Come on. Come on.

14:24.420 --> 14:28.550
All right,
let's try that one again.

14:28.624 --> 14:29.886
Come on.

14:29.959 --> 14:31.051
Aah!

14:31.127 --> 14:32.219
Aah!

14:32.294 --> 14:33.386
Go!

14:33.462 --> 14:35.396
Any excuse,Jim baby.

14:35.464 --> 14:36.988
Run away!

14:38.567 --> 14:40.000
Run away!

14:40.069 --> 14:41.058
Aah!

14:41.137 --> 14:42.729
Run away!

14:42.805 --> 14:43.897
Aah!

14:43.973 --> 14:46.339
- What was it?
- Yeoman Barrows.

14:52.148 --> 14:53.581
[Crying]

14:59.221 --> 15:00.586
What happened?

15:00.656 --> 15:02.851
I don't know.

15:02.925 --> 15:05.359
I mean I do know, I guess.

15:05.428 --> 15:07.191
I was following the tracks,

15:07.263 --> 15:08.696
and there he was.

15:08.764 --> 15:09.856
Who was?

15:09.932 --> 15:11.991
Him.

15:12.068 --> 15:13.365
Give me your report.

15:13.436 --> 15:15.370
He...

15:15.438 --> 15:17.372
He had a cloak, sir,

15:17.440 --> 15:20.898
and--and a dagger
with jewels on it.

15:20.976 --> 15:22.876
You're not imagining all this?

15:22.945 --> 15:24.879
Captain, I know
it sounds incredible,

15:24.947 --> 15:27.381
but I did not imagine it

15:27.450 --> 15:30.544
any more than I imagined
he did this.

15:30.619 --> 15:33.247
Sounds like Don Juan.

15:39.795 --> 15:41.057
Yes.

15:41.130 --> 15:42.392
Yes.

15:43.799 --> 15:44.891
It was--

15:44.967 --> 15:47.401
It was so...
sort of story book

15:47.470 --> 15:48.903
walking around here,

15:48.971 --> 15:50.905
and I was thinking,

15:50.973 --> 15:53.908
"All a girl needs is...

15:53.976 --> 15:55.273
Don Juan."

15:57.046 --> 15:59.480
Just day dreaming
the way you would

15:59.548 --> 16:02.346
about someone
you'd like to meet.

16:04.420 --> 16:06.445
Mr. Sulu was with you.

16:06.522 --> 16:07.955
Where is he now?

16:08.023 --> 16:09.923
He ran after him.

16:09.992 --> 16:11.687
Stay with her, Doctor.

16:17.600 --> 16:18.692
Mr. Sulu!

16:20.436 --> 16:21.733
Sulu!

16:36.452 --> 16:37.714
Mr. Sulu!

16:40.122 --> 16:41.214
Sulu!

16:56.305 --> 16:57.329
Sulu!

17:25.634 --> 17:27.363
Ruth?

17:35.110 --> 17:36.304
Ruth.

17:46.322 --> 17:48.449
Jim, darling,

17:48.524 --> 17:50.549
it is me.

17:50.626 --> 17:52.321
It is Ruth.

18:08.544 --> 18:09.636
Captain 's log.

18:09.712 --> 18:11.304
Stardate 3025.8.

18:11.380 --> 18:15.476
Investigation of this increasingly
unusual planet continues,

18:15.551 --> 18:17.644
and we are seeing things

18:17.720 --> 18:20.314
that cannot possibly exist,

18:20.389 --> 18:22.482
yet they are undeniably real.

18:22.558 --> 18:23.991
[Beeping]

18:24.059 --> 18:26.220
McCoy, do you read me?

18:43.312 --> 18:44.836
Ruth.

18:51.654 --> 18:54.088
Ruth, how can it be you?

18:54.156 --> 18:59.526
How could you...
possibly be here?

18:59.595 --> 19:01.028
You haven't aged.

19:03.332 --> 19:05.527
It's been 15 years.

19:09.104 --> 19:10.594
It doesn't matter.

19:12.107 --> 19:13.597
None ofthat matters.

19:16.111 --> 19:17.908
[Beeping]

19:19.682 --> 19:20.808
Kirk here.

19:20.883 --> 19:23.545
Did you find Mr. Sulu, Captain?

19:23.619 --> 19:25.143
What?

19:25.220 --> 19:27.814
Did you find Mr. Sulu?

19:27.890 --> 19:29.289
No,

19:29.358 --> 19:31.553
but I'm sure he's all right.

19:31.627 --> 19:32.719
Sir?

19:32.795 --> 19:34.228
Are you allright?

19:34.296 --> 19:36.093
Yes, I'm fine.

19:36.165 --> 19:37.564
[Beeping]

19:37.633 --> 19:39.567
Rodriguez to Captain Kirk.

19:39.635 --> 19:41.500
Yes, Mr. Rodriguez.

19:41.570 --> 19:44.004
Captain, a while ago, I saw--

19:44.073 --> 19:46.735
well, birds,
a whole flock of them.

19:46.809 --> 19:49.175
Don't you like birds,
Mr. Rodriguez?

19:49.244 --> 19:50.677
I like them fine,

19:50.746 --> 19:52.441
but all our surveys showed--

19:52.514 --> 19:56.575
Then, offhand,
I'd say our instruments are defective.

19:56.652 --> 20:01.589
There are indeed life-forms
on this planet.

20:01.657 --> 20:03.318
Sir, uh...

20:03.392 --> 20:06.327
our surveys couldn 't
have been that wrong.

20:08.063 --> 20:10.588
Mr. Rodriguez,

20:10.666 --> 20:13.658
have the search parties
rendezvous at the glade.

20:15.838 --> 20:18.136
I'd like some answers
to all this.

20:18.207 --> 20:20.198
- Aye, aye, sir.
- You have to go?

20:28.684 --> 20:30.117
I don't want to.

20:32.020 --> 20:35.615
You'll see me again
if you want to.

20:35.691 --> 20:39.127
You haven't told me...

20:39.194 --> 20:41.128
You haven't told me...

20:41.196 --> 20:43.630
Do what you have to do...

20:45.300 --> 20:46.631
and I'll be waiting.

20:49.705 --> 20:51.502
Ruth.

20:53.709 --> 20:55.734
[Beeping]

20:57.546 --> 20:58.638
Kirk here.

20:58.714 --> 20:59.738
Captain.

21:02.317 --> 21:03.909
Yes, Mr. Spock.

21:03.986 --> 21:06.921
Getting strange readings
from the planet's surface, Captain.

21:06.989 --> 21:09.389
Some sort of power field
down there.

21:10.993 --> 21:12.085
Specify.

21:12.161 --> 21:14.095
Highly sophisticated type of energy

21:14.163 --> 21:16.097
draining our power
and increasing.

21:16.165 --> 21:18.292
Beginning to affect
our communications.

21:19.668 --> 21:21.533
Can you pinpoint the source?

21:21.603 --> 21:24.436
Could be coming from
beneath the planet's surface.

21:24.506 --> 21:27.066
Patterns indicate some sort
of industrial activity.

21:27.142 --> 21:28.939
Keep me posted, Mr. Spock.

21:29.011 --> 21:31.605
We'll continue our investigation
down here.

21:33.182 --> 21:34.672
Captain out.

21:52.701 --> 21:53.793
Feeling better?

21:53.869 --> 21:54.961
A little,

21:55.037 --> 21:57.904
but I wouldn't want
to be alone here.

21:57.973 --> 21:59.531
This is a beautiful place.

21:59.608 --> 22:00.939
Strange, I'll admit.

22:01.009 --> 22:02.442
That's just it.

22:02.511 --> 22:03.944
It's almost too beautiful.

22:04.012 --> 22:06.913
I was thinking,
before my tunic was torn,

22:06.982 --> 22:09.246
that in a place like this

22:09.318 --> 22:11.752
a girl should be...
oh, let's see now,

22:11.820 --> 22:14.914
a girl should be dressed
like a fairy-tale princess

22:14.990 --> 22:16.924
with lots of floaty stuff

22:16.992 --> 22:19.426
and a tall hat with a veil.

22:19.495 --> 22:21.429
I see what you mean,

22:21.497 --> 22:24.432
but then you'd have
whole armies of Don Juans

22:24.500 --> 22:25.933
to fight off...

22:26.001 --> 22:28.401
and me, too.

22:28.470 --> 22:30.404
Is that a promise, Doctor?

22:49.691 --> 22:52.990
Oh, Doctor, they're lovely.

22:57.165 --> 22:58.564
Look at me, Doctor--

22:58.634 --> 23:02.092
A lady to be protected
and fought for.

23:06.975 --> 23:09.569
A princess of the blood royal.

23:11.113 --> 23:14.139
You are all of those things...

23:14.216 --> 23:16.207
and many more.

23:16.285 --> 23:19.584
They'll look even lovelier
with you wearing them.

23:23.158 --> 23:24.853
Doctor...

23:26.495 --> 23:27.621
I'm afraid.

23:27.696 --> 23:30.597
Now, look, I don't know how or why,

23:30.666 --> 23:33.066
but the dress is here.

23:33.135 --> 23:35.603
I'd like to see you in it.

23:39.074 --> 23:42.100
Why don't you put it on?

23:42.177 --> 23:44.145
All right...

23:46.181 --> 23:49.173
but you stay right there.

23:49.251 --> 23:51.185
And don't peek.

23:51.253 --> 23:52.686
My dear girl,

23:52.754 --> 23:54.187
I am a doctor.

23:54.256 --> 23:55.689
When I peek,

23:55.757 --> 23:58.055
it's in the line of duty.

24:03.432 --> 24:04.922
[Beeping]

24:06.635 --> 24:08.569
Calling Dr. McCoy.

24:08.637 --> 24:10.229
McCoy here.

24:10.305 --> 24:12.239
I, uh...

24:15.644 --> 24:17.908
I can't read you very well.

24:17.980 --> 24:19.572
Is this Rodriguez?

24:19.648 --> 24:22.583
This is all the volume
I can get on this thing.

24:22.651 --> 24:25.085
I can't read you well, either.

24:25.153 --> 24:26.586
Captain 's orders.

24:26.655 --> 24:30.284
Rendezvous at that glade
where he first found you.

24:31.660 --> 24:32.922
Right.

24:32.995 --> 24:36.624
What the devil's wrong with...

24:36.698 --> 24:39.428
communications?

24:39.501 --> 24:41.594
Esteban.

24:41.670 --> 24:42.762
Esteban.

24:46.308 --> 24:47.673
[Rahhrrr]

25:00.122 --> 25:01.146
Doctor.

25:02.457 --> 25:03.754
Doctor.

25:07.529 --> 25:08.996
Doctor McCoy!

25:49.304 --> 25:52.740
You're the science officer, Mr. Spock.
I want some answers.

25:52.808 --> 25:55.606
First there was McCoy's
Alice in Wonderland

25:55.677 --> 25:57.872
where there's supposedly
no animal life.

25:57.946 --> 26:01.211
And Sulu's gun where there's
no refined metal detected.

26:01.283 --> 26:02.716
Rodriguez' birds...

26:02.784 --> 26:04.217
and then my...

26:04.286 --> 26:07.687
well, the two people I saw.

26:07.756 --> 26:11.556
Any chance these
could be hallucinations?

26:11.626 --> 26:15.357
One hallucination flattened me
with a clout on the jaw.

26:15.430 --> 26:19.059
That sounds like
a painful reality.

26:19.134 --> 26:20.328
Yes.

26:20.402 --> 26:23.166
There must besome logical explanation.

26:25.140 --> 26:27.904
Your signal's weak.
Can you turn up your gain?

26:27.976 --> 26:29.910
I'm already on maximum.

26:29.978 --> 26:33.209
Captain, shall I beam down
an armed party?

26:33.281 --> 26:35.909
Negative. Our people here
are armed with phasers.

26:35.984 --> 26:39.078
Besides, there's yet to be
any real danger.

26:42.657 --> 26:43.749
Captain out.

27:06.982 --> 27:09.212
McCoy.
McCoy, do you read me?

27:09.284 --> 27:12.048
Kirk to McCoy.
Come in.

27:12.120 --> 27:14.554
Captain, take cover!

27:14.623 --> 27:16.386
There's a samurai after me.

27:16.458 --> 27:19.052
I mean, there was...

27:19.127 --> 27:21.561
Captain, you've
got to believe me.

27:21.630 --> 27:24.064
I've met some interesting
personalities myself.

27:24.132 --> 27:26.896
Have you seen any ofthe others?

27:26.968 --> 27:29.061
Got a call a few minutes ago.
Rodriguez.

27:29.137 --> 27:31.901
Said you were rendezvousing
back at the glade.

27:31.973 --> 27:34.908
I hope he got through
to everybody.

27:34.976 --> 27:36.238
Communications are almost out.

27:36.311 --> 27:37.573
That's not all.

27:37.646 --> 27:39.238
So's my phaser.

27:43.351 --> 27:44.477
Yeah.

27:46.988 --> 27:49.081
We better get to the glade.

27:49.157 --> 27:50.249
Yes, sir.

27:50.325 --> 27:51.587
Look.

28:03.905 --> 28:06.203
Someone beaming down
from the bridge.

28:06.274 --> 28:07.241
Trying to.

28:07.309 --> 28:09.038
Something's obstructing it.

28:11.413 --> 28:13.005
Mr. Spock.

28:13.081 --> 28:15.140
No one was to leave the ship.

28:15.217 --> 28:16.206
Necessary, Captain.

28:16.284 --> 28:18.718
Unable to contact you
by communicator,

28:18.787 --> 28:21.221
and the transporter
is useless now.

28:21.289 --> 28:24.224
There's an unusual
power field down here.

28:24.292 --> 28:27.728
It's soaking up all the energy
at the source.

28:27.796 --> 28:29.423
After calculating
its growth rate,

28:29.497 --> 28:32.227
I reasoned we might transport
one more person.

28:32.300 --> 28:34.564
Good. We can use your help.

28:34.636 --> 28:36.069
We're stranded here, Captain?

28:36.137 --> 28:38.128
Until we can find out
what this is all about.

28:41.643 --> 28:43.076
There's no one here.

28:43.144 --> 28:46.079
This is where the captain
said to rendezvous.

28:59.094 --> 29:01.961
I'd swear I heard
someone moving around.

29:02.030 --> 29:03.588
Don't talk like that.

29:03.665 --> 29:05.530
A princess shouldn't be afraid,

29:05.600 --> 29:08.364
not with a brave knight
to protect her.

29:08.436 --> 29:09.630
[Tiger Roars]

29:11.706 --> 29:13.298
That way.

29:13.375 --> 29:14.307
Spread out.

29:14.376 --> 29:15.934
Let's find it.

29:20.348 --> 29:21.815
[Hoofbeats]

29:36.831 --> 29:39.664
These things cannot be real.

29:39.734 --> 29:42.669
Hallucinations can't harm us.

29:43.738 --> 29:46.172
Go back to where you were.

29:58.553 --> 29:59.884
Aah...

29:59.955 --> 30:01.115
That doesn't work.

30:15.770 --> 30:17.067
He's dead.

30:37.625 --> 30:39.058
Captain 's log, supplemental.

30:39.127 --> 30:41.721
All contact with the Enterprise
has been lost.

30:41.796 --> 30:43.229
We're trapped here.

30:43.298 --> 30:46.233
Our ship 's surgeon,
my personal friend, is dead.

30:46.301 --> 30:49.168
We're certain now
that whatever we're facing

30:49.237 --> 30:51.171
is terribly real.

30:53.241 --> 30:55.175
It's my fault.

30:55.243 --> 30:58.007
It never would have happened.

30:58.079 --> 31:00.673
It's my fault.

31:00.749 --> 31:04.014
It is, it is.
I'm to blame.

31:06.087 --> 31:07.179
Yeoman.

31:11.092 --> 31:13.185
We're in trouble.

31:13.261 --> 31:16.753
I need every crewman
alert and thinking.

31:20.101 --> 31:21.193
Aye, aye, sir.

31:23.438 --> 31:24.370
Captain!

31:24.439 --> 31:25.371
Captain!

31:36.051 --> 31:38.952
You'd better have
a look at this, sir.

31:40.889 --> 31:42.186
I don't understand.

31:42.257 --> 31:44.088
Neither do I, Mr. Sulu,

31:44.159 --> 31:46.354
but before we leave this planet,

31:46.428 --> 31:47.395
I will.

31:48.696 --> 31:50.630
It's like a dummy, Captain.

31:50.698 --> 31:53.861
It couldn't be alive.

31:53.935 --> 31:54.867
Tricorder?

31:54.936 --> 31:56.233
Still operating, sir.

31:57.305 --> 31:58.237
Mr. Spock.

32:06.614 --> 32:09.048
What do you make oft hat?

32:12.554 --> 32:15.523
This is not human skin tissue, Captain.

32:15.590 --> 32:17.080
It more closely resembles

32:17.158 --> 32:20.616
the cellular casting we use for
wound repairs. Much finer, of course.

32:20.695 --> 32:24.893
I want an exactjudgment, Mr. Spock.

32:24.966 --> 32:27.230
This is definitely
a mechanical contrivance.

32:27.302 --> 32:29.793
It has the same basic cell structure
as the plants here,

32:29.871 --> 32:31.736
even the trees, the grass.

32:31.806 --> 32:34.673
Are you saying
this is a plant, Mr. Spock?

32:34.742 --> 32:37.575
I'm saying that these are
all multicellular castings.

32:37.645 --> 32:40.205
The plants, the animals,
the people--

32:40.281 --> 32:41.748
they're all being manufactured.

32:42.984 --> 32:44.008
By who?

32:44.085 --> 32:45.916
And why?

32:45.987 --> 32:47.921
And why these particular things?

32:47.989 --> 32:49.923
All we know for certain

32:49.991 --> 32:53.859
is that they act
exactly like the real thing,

32:53.928 --> 32:56.726
Just as pleasant...

32:56.798 --> 32:58.129
or just as deadly.

33:04.405 --> 33:05.838
[Airplane Approaches]

33:11.279 --> 33:12.871
What is it?

33:12.947 --> 33:15.814
Of all the crazy things...

33:17.118 --> 33:20.110
Remember what I was telling you
a while ago,

33:20.188 --> 33:24.386
about the early wars
and funny air vehicles they used?

33:24.459 --> 33:25.949
That's one ofthem.

33:26.027 --> 33:27.551
Can it hurt us?

33:27.629 --> 33:30.223
Not unless it makes
a strafing run.

33:30.298 --> 33:31.458
A what?

33:31.533 --> 33:35.560
The way they used to attack people
on the ground.

33:41.709 --> 33:43.506
Come on.

34:03.431 --> 34:04.864
Angela...

34:09.270 --> 34:10.862
Angela...

34:30.625 --> 34:31.853
Captain!

34:35.964 --> 34:37.056
McCoy's body.

34:37.130 --> 34:38.563
He's gone.
Dragged off.

34:38.632 --> 34:40.464
The black knight, too.

34:47.909 --> 34:49.001
Spock?

34:49.077 --> 34:52.170
My analysis may not sound
very scientific.

34:52.246 --> 34:54.181
McCoy's death is a fact.

34:54.248 --> 34:55.681
There is one possibility,

34:55.750 --> 34:57.183
very slim,
but never the less--

34:57.252 --> 34:59.015
Captain, what were your thoughts

34:59.087 --> 35:00.349
Just before you encountered

35:00.421 --> 35:01.854
the people you described?

35:03.925 --> 35:05.358
I was...

35:07.929 --> 35:10.363
I was thinking
about the academy.

35:11.933 --> 35:13.195
My days...

35:15.937 --> 35:17.370
Hey,Jim baby!

35:17.438 --> 35:19.167
I see you brought reinforcements.

35:19.240 --> 35:22.403
Ha! Well, I'm waiting
for you,Jimmy boy.

35:22.477 --> 35:24.035
Finnegan.

35:25.747 --> 35:26.679
Finnegan!

35:29.784 --> 35:32.344
What's been happening
to my people?

35:32.420 --> 35:34.854
Whoo, ha ha ha ha...

35:37.091 --> 35:39.559
Take Sulu.
Find McCoy's body.

35:39.627 --> 35:42.061
This man is my problem.

35:42.130 --> 35:43.062
Captain, wait.

35:43.131 --> 35:45.531
That's an order, Mr. Spock.

36:01.516 --> 36:02.847
Here I am!

36:02.917 --> 36:04.179
Yaah, ha ha!

36:04.252 --> 36:05.184
Run!

36:10.258 --> 36:11.850
"Jim "

36:11.926 --> 36:13.621
Ha ha ha ha!

36:16.164 --> 36:17.529
Ha ha ha!

36:17.598 --> 36:20.032
Catch me!

36:20.101 --> 36:22.695
Can't you see me?
Ha ha ha...

36:22.770 --> 36:24.533
Come and get me!

36:24.605 --> 36:27.130
Ha ha ha ha...

36:27.709 --> 36:28.698
Here I am!

36:28.776 --> 36:30.869
You're blind!

36:30.945 --> 36:35.041
You never could find your head
with both hands!

36:35.116 --> 36:38.085
Like it used to be,Jimmy.

36:38.152 --> 36:39.813
Remember?

36:39.887 --> 36:41.650
Ha ha ha ha!

36:55.570 --> 36:57.401
Hey,Jim...

37:03.244 --> 37:04.836
I want some answers.

37:04.912 --> 37:06.937
Ah. Coming up.

37:46.788 --> 37:47.720
Get up.

37:47.789 --> 37:49.484
Get up.

37:49.557 --> 37:50.990
Get up.

37:51.058 --> 37:53.151
Always fight fair, don't you?

37:53.227 --> 37:55.923
You officer and gentleman, you.

37:55.997 --> 37:57.828
You're a stupid under classman.

37:57.899 --> 38:00.993
I've got the edge.
I'm still 20 years old.

38:01.068 --> 38:02.501
Look at you.

38:02.570 --> 38:03.502
Heh.

38:03.571 --> 38:04.731
You're an old man.

38:18.286 --> 38:20.049
Aah...

38:20.121 --> 38:23.818
I--I can't move me leg.

38:23.891 --> 38:25.518
I can't feel me leg.

38:25.593 --> 38:27.185
My back is broken.

38:27.261 --> 38:28.751
You've broken me back.

38:31.432 --> 38:32.364
Feel that?

38:40.441 --> 38:42.272
Can you feel that, now?

38:49.050 --> 38:51.985
Sleep sweet,Jimmy boy.

38:52.053 --> 38:54.817
Sleep as long as you like.

38:54.889 --> 38:56.447
Sleep forever,Jim baby.

38:56.524 --> 38:58.492
Forever and forever.

38:58.559 --> 39:00.993
Ha ha ha ha...

39:22.583 --> 39:26.178
Ha ha.
Won't you ever learn,Jim boy?

39:26.254 --> 39:29.690
You never could take me,
you know.

39:29.757 --> 39:31.691
Finnegan...

39:31.759 --> 39:33.090
one thing--

39:36.764 --> 39:37.753
Sure.

39:37.832 --> 39:38.764
Name it.

39:40.401 --> 39:41.333
Answers.

39:43.004 --> 39:43.936
Earn them!

40:46.167 --> 40:47.828
Not bad.

40:54.275 --> 40:57.039
Kind of makes up for things,
huh,Jim?

40:57.111 --> 40:58.908
A lot of things.

41:00.181 --> 41:02.376
What's been happening
to my people?

41:04.852 --> 41:08.083
I never answer questions
from plebes,Jimmy boy.

41:08.155 --> 41:09.986
I'm not a plebe.

41:11.692 --> 41:13.455
This is today,

41:13.527 --> 41:15.791
15 years later.

41:20.034 --> 41:21.763
What are you doing here?

41:24.372 --> 41:28.536
I'm being exactly
what you expect me to be,Jimmy boy.

41:54.101 --> 41:55.796
Did you enjoy it, Captain?

41:58.939 --> 42:00.930
Yes, I enjoyed it.

42:01.008 --> 42:03.238
After all these years...

42:04.345 --> 42:05.710
I did enjoy it.

42:07.748 --> 42:10.979
The one thing I wanted to do
was to beat the tar out of Finnegan.

42:11.052 --> 42:13.782
Which supports a theory
I've been formulating.

42:13.854 --> 42:16.618
That we're all meeting
people and things

42:16.691 --> 42:19.387
that we happen to be thinking about
at the moment.

42:19.460 --> 42:21.792
Yes. Somehow our thoughts are read,

42:21.862 --> 42:24.797
these things are quickly
manufactured for us.

42:24.865 --> 42:26.958
Dangers we happen
to think of--

42:27.034 --> 42:30.128
Yes. We must all control
our thoughts.

42:30.204 --> 42:32.638
The force field is
obviously underground

42:32.707 --> 42:34.231
manufacturing these things.

42:34.308 --> 42:36.139
Passages lead to the surface.

42:36.210 --> 42:38.474
When Rodriguez thought of a tiger--

42:47.488 --> 42:50.582
We've got to get back
to the landing party

42:50.658 --> 42:52.091
and warn them.

43:03.571 --> 43:04.936
[Airplane Approaches]

43:21.722 --> 43:22.654
Oof!

43:34.602 --> 43:35.534
Oh!

43:39.039 --> 43:39.971
Aah...

43:40.040 --> 43:41.530
No. No!

43:48.415 --> 43:51.077
Sulu, Rodriguez, Barrows,

43:51.152 --> 43:52.414
front and center.

43:52.486 --> 43:53.418
Sir--

43:53.487 --> 43:54.920
Don't ask any questions.

43:54.989 --> 43:56.923
Face front, everyone.

43:56.991 --> 44:00.757
Don't talk...
Don't breathe...

44:00.828 --> 44:02.420
Don't think...

44:02.496 --> 44:04.259
You're at attention.

44:04.331 --> 44:06.925
Concentrate on that...

44:07.001 --> 44:09.094
and only that.

44:09.170 --> 44:10.159
Concentrate.

44:11.705 --> 44:12.637
Captain.

44:22.183 --> 44:23.445
Who are you?

44:23.517 --> 44:26.384
I'm the caretaker of this place,
Captain Kirk.

44:26.453 --> 44:28.444
You know my name?

44:28.522 --> 44:30.387
But of course.

44:30.457 --> 44:33.358
Lieutenant Rodriguez...

44:33.427 --> 44:35.759
Lieutenant Sulu...

44:35.830 --> 44:37.855
Yeoman Barrows,

44:37.932 --> 44:39.524
and Mr. Spock.

44:39.600 --> 44:42.535
We'vejust discovered
you don't understand all this.

44:42.603 --> 44:46.039
These experiences were
intended to amuse you.

44:46.106 --> 44:47.300
Amuse?

44:47.374 --> 44:49.638
That's your word
for what we've been through?

44:49.710 --> 44:51.974
But none of this is permanent.

44:52.046 --> 44:54.810
Here, you have to only imagine
your fondest wishes,

44:54.882 --> 44:59.114
old ones you wish to relive
or new ones, anything--

44:59.186 --> 45:01.814
fear, love, triumph...

45:01.889 --> 45:05.325
Anything that pleases you
can be made to happen.

45:05.392 --> 45:06.620
The term is amusement park.

45:06.694 --> 45:07.922
Of course.

45:07.995 --> 45:10.828
An old Earth name for a place
where people could go

45:10.898 --> 45:14.425
to see and do all sorts
of fascinating things.

45:14.501 --> 45:17.902
This entire planet was constructed
for our race of people

45:17.972 --> 45:18.904
to come...

45:18.973 --> 45:20.338
and play.

45:20.407 --> 45:21.669
Play?

45:21.742 --> 45:24.836
As advanced
as you obviously are,

45:24.912 --> 45:26.812
and you still play?

45:26.881 --> 45:28.348
Yes, play, Mr. Sulu.

45:28.415 --> 45:30.349
The more complex the mind,

45:30.417 --> 45:33.545
the greater the need
for the simplicity of play.

45:33.621 --> 45:36.181
Exactly, Captain.
How perceptive ofyou.

45:36.257 --> 45:39.852
That still doesn't explain
the death of my ship's surgeon.

45:39.927 --> 45:43.124
Possibly because no one
has died,Jim.

45:45.833 --> 45:47.960
I was taken below the surface

45:48.035 --> 45:49.900
for some rather
remarkable repairs.

45:49.970 --> 45:51.198
It's amazing.

45:51.272 --> 45:54.298
They've got a factory complex
you wouldn't believe.

45:54.375 --> 45:57.401
They can build
or do anything immediately.

46:03.751 --> 46:06.811
And, uh, how do you
explain them?

46:06.887 --> 46:09.321
Oh. Them. Well...

46:09.390 --> 46:10.823
I, uh...

46:10.891 --> 46:15.328
I was thinking about a cabaret
I know on Rigel II,

46:15.396 --> 46:19.992
and, uh, there were these two girls
in a chorus line...

46:21.268 --> 46:23.202
And, well, here they are.

46:26.240 --> 46:28.834
Well, after all,
I am on shore leave.

46:28.909 --> 46:30.274
And so am l.

46:30.344 --> 46:32.005
Yes. So you are.

46:32.079 --> 46:35.515
Well, girls, I suppose
you can turn something up.

46:39.753 --> 46:43.189
We regret that some of you've
been made uncomfortable.

46:43.257 --> 46:46.192
You say your people
built all this.

46:46.260 --> 46:49.457
Who are you?
What planet are you from?

46:49.530 --> 46:52.465
My impression is
that your race

46:52.533 --> 46:56.299
is not yet ready to
understand us, Captain.

46:56.370 --> 46:58.304
I tend to agree.

46:58.372 --> 46:59.805
[Communicator Beeps]

47:01.875 --> 47:02.807
Kirk here.

47:02.876 --> 47:04.468
This is the bridge, Captain.

47:04.545 --> 47:06.479
Our power systems
have just come back in.

47:06.547 --> 47:08.139
Do you require assistance?

47:08.215 --> 47:09.648
Everything is in order.

47:09.717 --> 47:10.649
Stand by.

47:10.718 --> 47:11.980
- However...
- Aye, aye, sir.

47:12.052 --> 47:14.316
If you would use
the proper caution,

47:14.388 --> 47:17.323
this amusement planet
could be an ideal place

47:17.391 --> 47:20.485
for your people
to enjoy themselves...

47:20.561 --> 47:21.994
if you wish.

47:22.062 --> 47:24.394
It's what
the doctor ordered,Jim.

47:27.234 --> 47:28.166
Lieutenant...

47:28.235 --> 47:29.327
Sir?

47:29.403 --> 47:32.668
Commence transporting
shore leave parties.

47:32.740 --> 47:34.173
Tell them to prepare

47:34.241 --> 47:37.335
for the best shore leave
they've ever had. Kirk out.

47:37.411 --> 47:40.847
Captain, I'll go back aboard ship
and take over.

47:40.914 --> 47:43.849
With all due respect
to the young lady,

47:43.917 --> 47:48.820
I've already had as much shore leave
as I care for.

47:48.889 --> 47:52.120
No, Mr. Spock.
I'll go. You--

48:06.040 --> 48:08.474
On the other hand...

48:08.542 --> 48:12.376
I'll stay for a day or two.

48:40.407 --> 48:42.967
Did you enjoy your rest, gentlemen?

48:43.043 --> 48:46.444
Yes, we...did, Mr. Spock.

48:46.513 --> 48:47.946
I think we did.

48:48.015 --> 48:50.506
Indeed we did, Mr. Spock.

48:53.020 --> 48:55.079
Most illogical.

49:05.866 --> 49:08.300
Ahead warp factor 1,
Mr. Sulu.
