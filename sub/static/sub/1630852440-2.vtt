<i>I live in Los Angeles now,</i>

01:24.334 --> 01:25.919
<i>I really don't. I really don't.</i>

01:26.002 --> 01:29.547
<i>I know being a New Yorker</i>
<i>who doesn't like L.A. is very cliche,</i>

01:29.631 --> 01:31.466
<i>but it's my truth. Okay?</i>

01:31.549 --> 01:34.052
<i>And I'm a whistleblower, if nothing else.</i>

01:34.552 --> 01:38.223
<i>Um, it's just little things.</i>
<i>I'm not an outdoorsy person and…</i>

01:38.306 --> 01:40.517
<i>Um, look, I know how science works, okay?</i>

01:40.600 --> 01:44.104
<i>I know that there is one sun</i>
<i>for this Earth. [chuckles]</i>

01:44.187 --> 01:47.816
<i>However, the sun</i>
<i>in Los Angeles is different.</i>

01:47.899 --> 01:49.025
<i>It's different.</i>

01:49.109 --> 01:52.779
<i>It really is, honey.</i>
<i>It's brighter. It's aggressive.</i>

01:53.321 --> 01:54.614
<i>It's judgmental.</i>

01:54.697 --> 01:57.492
<i>That's just it.</i>
<i>That's a fact. It is, it is.</i>

01:57.575 --> 01:59.410
<i>I have blackout curtains</i>

<i>And yet every morning,</i>

02:05.083 --> 02:08.795
<i>I am still awakened</i>
<i>by that one strip of sun.</i>

02:08.878 --> 02:13.007
<i>Okay? That one strip between</i>
<i>the curtain and the window pane,</i>

02:13.091 --> 02:16.052
<i>every morning</i>
<i>hits my eyeball, and is like,</i>

02:16.136 --> 02:17.554
<i>"Why aren't you hiking?"</i>

<i>That's it.</i>

<i>That's what they want you to do.</i>
<i>They want you hiking.</i>

02:29.274 --> 02:32.068
<i>And I will not be fooled.</i>
<i>Hiking is dramatic walking.</i>

02:33.153 --> 02:34.946
<i>I won't. I won't be fooled.</i>

02:35.029 --> 02:37.031
<i>I know people in L.A.</i>
<i>don't like L.A. either.</i>

02:37.115 --> 02:38.658
<i>And I could tell because…</i>

02:38.741 --> 02:42.412
<i>It's true, because when I moved there</i>
<i>I was new, I was young.</i>

02:42.495 --> 02:45.165
<i>I was like, "I'm here. What should I do?"</i>

02:45.790 --> 02:48.293
<i>And people were like,</i>
<i>"Wow, you're new to Los Angeles?"</i>

02:48.376 --> 02:50.879
<i>"You know where you should go? San Diego."</i>

02:50.962 --> 02:53.089
<i>Yeah. Yeah, yeah. yeah.</i>

02:53.173 --> 02:57.760
<i>What about San Francisco, Santa Barbara,</i>
<i>Ojai, Big Bear, Big Sur, Palm Springs?</i>

02:57.844 --> 02:59.971
<i>What about here? Okay?</i>

03:00.638 --> 03:04.559
<i>When you come to New York City,</i>
<i>no one's like, "You been to Hoboken?" No.</i>

03:04.642 --> 03:07.020
<i>[audience applauds and cheers]</i>

03:07.103 --> 03:09.105
<i>No. No.</i>

<i>It's all right here.</i>
<i>It's all right here, okay?</i>

03:14.777 --> 03:18.323
<i>Even Staten Island</i>
<i>will give you a nautical moment. You know?</i>

03:19.657 --> 03:22.994
<i>But in L.A. it's like,</i>
<i>"Welcome to L.A. Pack a bag."</i>

03:23.494 --> 03:26.831
<i>Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm.</i>
<i>You don't love it, you don't love it.</i>

03:26.915 --> 03:29.626
<i>Um, but I did do</i>
<i>one of these getaways everyone said.</i>

03:29.709 --> 03:31.211
<i>I went to Palm Springs.</i>

03:31.294 --> 03:35.757
<i>Okay? Which is just a desert town</i>
<i>two hours outside of L.A.</i>

03:35.840 --> 03:38.009
<i>And I didn't think I was gonna be down,</i>

03:38.092 --> 03:41.012
<i>'cause it's the desert</i>
<i>and I don't like to sweat in public,</i>

03:41.512 --> 03:44.140
<i>but I loved it. I loved it, it turns out.</i>

03:44.224 --> 03:48.311
<i>And the reason why I love</i>
<i>Palm Springs is because when I…</i>

03:48.394 --> 03:49.687
<i>Hmm, how do I put this?</i>

03:50.355 --> 03:52.523
<i>When I wanna practice</i>
<i>self-care, all right,</i>

03:52.607 --> 03:54.525
<i>when I want to get away from it all,</i>

03:54.609 --> 03:58.363
<i>I like to imagine</i>
<i>I'm a protagonist in a Nancy Meyers movie.</i>

03:58.446 --> 04:01.199
<i>Okay? That is.</i>
<i>It's about when I'm trying to feel good.</i>

04:01.282 --> 04:03.326
<i>If you've never seen</i>
<i>a Nancy Meyers joint</i>

04:03.409 --> 04:07.580
<i>like </i>Something's Gotta Give,
It's Complicated, The Holiday…

04:07.664 --> 04:09.916
<i>Whenever Diane Keaton</i>
<i>is feeling frisky. Okay?</i>

04:09.999 --> 04:11.084
<i>[audience cheers]</i>

04:11.167 --> 04:15.505
<i>If you've never seen a Nancy Meyers joint,</i>
<i>I will break it down for you very simply.</i>

04:15.588 --> 04:18.925
<i>First, imagine I'm a white woman.</i>
<i>All right?</i>

04:20.051 --> 04:23.054
<i>I'm in my fifties. I'm in my sixties.</i>

04:23.137 --> 04:25.390
<i>I'm living </i>in<i> the hot flash. Okay?</i>

04:25.473 --> 04:28.351
<i>I'm in a moment in time.</i>
<i>I'm in a moment in time.</i>

04:28.935 --> 04:30.895
<i>My name is Margot, with a T.</i>

04:33.314 --> 04:36.818
<i>And I'm wearing taupe.</i>
<i>I'm wearing cream. I'm wearing beige.</i>

04:38.236 --> 04:40.113
<i>Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

04:40.780 --> 04:41.990
<i>Eggshell, ecru.</i>

04:43.950 --> 04:47.578
<i>And whatever I'm wearing</i>
<i>is loose, but also fitted. You know?</i>

04:48.162 --> 04:49.205
<i>That's my vibe.</i>

04:49.289 --> 04:50.748
<i>And at some point in the movie,</i>

04:50.832 --> 04:54.711
<i>I will be sitting with my best friend</i>
<i>drinking a California white wine.</i>

04:55.461 --> 04:58.548
<i>And I'll say, "His new wife is how old?"</i>

04:59.299 --> 05:02.343
<i>And that's every Nancy Meyers movie</i>
<i>in a nutshell. Yes.</i>

05:02.427 --> 05:04.971
<i>-[audience cheers]</i>
<i>-Thank you. Yeah. It's true.</i>

05:05.972 --> 05:07.265
<i>It's very true.</i>

05:07.348 --> 05:10.268
<i>His new wife is always too young. Okay?</i>

05:11.311 --> 05:15.440
<i>And that was Palm Springs.</i>
<i>Palm Springs was Caucasian decadence.</i>

05:15.940 --> 05:18.776
<i>It was "his" and "hers" kitchen sinks.</i>

05:18.860 --> 05:20.695
<i>You know? That kind of a level.</i>

05:20.778 --> 05:23.573
<i>It's funny traveling while Black</i>
<i>in a place like Palm Springs,</i>

05:23.656 --> 05:25.074
<i>nobody knows how you got there.</i>

05:25.158 --> 05:27.702
<i>And you kind of start a whisper campaign.</i>

05:27.785 --> 05:30.621
<i>Walk into the restaurant</i>
<i>and they're like, "Is it Michelle?"</i>

05:30.705 --> 05:32.957
<i>And it's like, "No."</i>

05:33.041 --> 05:35.626
<i>-[scattered applause]</i>
<i>-"No. It's not."</i>

05:36.794 --> 05:39.297
<i>"But I will take a free appetizer."</i>
<i>You know?</i>

05:39.839 --> 05:44.010
<i>Yeah. We were staying in this hotel</i>
<i>where people could bring their dogs,</i>

05:44.093 --> 05:47.347
<i>which normally I wouldn't have been into,</i>
<i>but something happened to me.</i>

05:47.430 --> 05:49.807
<i>I moved to L.A.,</i>
<i>I felt that hot air on my face,</i>

05:49.891 --> 05:52.435
<i>and I was like,</i>
<i>"I want a dog and a podcast."</i>

05:52.518 --> 05:55.480
<i>You know? Immediately. Immediately.</i>

05:56.022 --> 05:59.275
<i>And there was this old, black Lab</i>
<i>sitting by the pool.</i>

05:59.359 --> 06:02.070
<i>And I love old dogs.</i>
<i>Old dogs are my jam.</i>

06:02.153 --> 06:05.573
<i>Okay? It's so true. Right?</i>
<i>I don't want a dog that hears the doorbell</i>

06:05.656 --> 06:07.742
<i>and starts running</i>
<i>in a circle and yapping.</i>

06:07.825 --> 06:10.578
<i>I want the dog</i>
<i>that hears the doorbell and is like,</i>

06:10.661 --> 06:11.913
<i>"You gonna get it?"</i>

06:13.498 --> 06:16.125
<i>You know what I mean?</i>
<i>Doesn't even lift up.</i>

06:16.209 --> 06:18.252
<i>Doesn't rise from the bed.</i>

06:18.336 --> 06:20.922
<i>And that was this black Lab.</i>
<i>Just chilling.</i>

06:21.005 --> 06:24.092
<i>Plus it's 100 degrees in Palm Springs,</i>
<i>so me and this black Lab</i>

06:24.175 --> 06:26.636
<i>are just two colored girls</i>
<i>trying to stay in the shade.</i>

06:28.721 --> 06:31.140
<i>We were besties. We made a life together.</i>

06:31.641 --> 06:34.268
<i>And after ten minutes</i>
<i>of me petting this dog,</i>

06:34.352 --> 06:37.230
<i>um, two older white women approach.</i>

06:37.897 --> 06:40.316
<i>Fresh out of a Nancy movie. Okay?</i>

06:40.400 --> 06:42.860
<i>They come over</i>
<i>because one of them owns the dog,</i>

06:42.944 --> 06:46.364
<i>and they're like, "Who are you?"</i>
<i>And they introduce themselves,</i>

06:46.447 --> 06:48.491
<i>and their names… [pops lips]</i>

06:48.574 --> 06:51.369
<i>were Susan and Jan.</i>

06:52.036 --> 06:53.413
<i>[screams]</i>

06:54.414 --> 06:56.290
<i>Oh, Palm Springs, take me away.</i>

06:56.374 --> 06:58.459
<i>[laughs] I love it.</i>

06:58.543 --> 06:59.919
<i>And we start chit-chatting,</i>

07:00.002 --> 07:02.630
<i>and I'm hoping</i>
<i>that Susan and Jan are a couple,</i>

07:02.713 --> 07:05.383
<i>but they're just friends,</i>
<i>and I'm like, "Boring, but…</i>

07:06.134 --> 07:07.468
<i>all right, keep talking."</i>

07:08.010 --> 07:11.139
<i>[chuckles] And we're chatting</i>
<i>and Susan and Jan are besties.</i>

07:11.222 --> 07:14.308
<i>They are on a vacay, a road trip.</i>

07:14.392 --> 07:17.854
<i>And Jan… stays with me.</i>

07:17.937 --> 07:22.817
<i>She has a place in my heart,</i>
<i>you guys, because Jan</i> lived

07:22.900 --> 07:24.444
<i>in Maui, Hawaii,</i>

07:24.944 --> 07:27.905
<i>and was on </i>vacation <i>in Palm Springs.</i>

07:27.989 --> 07:30.241
<i>[audience member screams]</i>

07:30.324 --> 07:31.534
<i>And… Yes, honey.</i>

07:31.617 --> 07:35.746
<i>And at one point, we're chit-chatting</i>
<i>and Jan says to me, dead serious,</i>

07:35.830 --> 07:38.708
<i>"Well, I know people</i>
<i>go to Maui for a vacation,</i>

07:38.791 --> 07:41.794
<i>but sometimes</i>
<i>I need a vacation from Maui!"</i>

07:42.587 --> 07:44.589
<i>What?</i>

07:44.672 --> 07:46.674
<i>[audience cheers and applauds]</i>

07:47.633 --> 07:49.093
<i>[laughs disbelievingly]</i>

07:51.387 --> 07:54.515
<i>Y'all, that is</i>
<i>the "Jannest" shit I ever heard.</i>

07:54.599 --> 07:56.642
<i>I said, "Jan, you a bad bitch."</i>

07:56.726 --> 07:58.311
<i>"Okay, Jan. I see you."</i>

07:58.394 --> 08:02.064
<i>"I see you talking to me</i>
<i>like I'm not Black in America. Go on."</i>

08:02.148 --> 08:03.566
<i>"Go on, Jan."</i>

08:05.151 --> 08:08.279
<i>And then later she goes,</i>
<i>"Well, while I'm on the mainland…"</i>

08:08.362 --> 08:11.240
<i>Okay. Pull it back, Jan.</i>
<i>Now it's overboard.</i>

08:11.324 --> 08:13.201
<i>You're probably from Indiana. Okay?</i>

08:14.160 --> 08:16.037
<i>She was like, "While I'm on the mainland,</i>

08:16.120 --> 08:18.915
<i>I was thinking of visiting my brother,</i>
<i>but I don't know."</i>

08:18.998 --> 08:21.542
<i>Jan don't give a fuck</i>
<i>about her brother, y'all!</i>

08:22.210 --> 08:24.462
<i>This is Jan's vacay.</i>

08:25.588 --> 08:28.508
<i>Oh, my God!</i>
<i>I'm trying to be a Jan in this life.</i>

08:29.300 --> 08:32.929
<i>I feel like right now, I'm a Susan.</i>
<i>I'm just along for the ride. You know?</i>

08:33.429 --> 08:36.015
<i>But Jan is making</i>
<i>the reservations, honey. Okay?</i>

08:36.098 --> 08:38.726
<i>She is setting you up for success.</i>

08:38.809 --> 08:41.854
<i>That is how I feel. I'm trying</i>
<i>to figure out, how do I channel Jan?</i>

08:41.938 --> 08:45.191
<i>How do I be the Jan</i>
<i>I want to see in the world?</i>

08:45.274 --> 08:48.736
<i>And so sometimes if I face</i>
<i>a minor inconvenience, like I stub my toe,</i>

08:48.819 --> 08:51.072
<i>I'll be like,</i>
<i>"I need a vacation from Maui."</i>

08:52.198 --> 08:54.617
<i>But that's not quite it.</i>
<i>That's not quite it.</i>

08:54.700 --> 08:58.829
<i>Jan was in her sixties,</i>
<i>she had two adult sons,</i>

08:58.913 --> 09:00.581
<i>and she was living her life.</i>

09:00.665 --> 09:02.875
<i>Jan had a </i>joie de vivre<i>, honey.</i>

09:02.959 --> 09:06.045
<i>Jan is taking lovers</i>
<i>and painting with watercolors.</i>

09:06.128 --> 09:10.091
<i>-[audience members cheer]</i>
<i>-Jan is doing it. She's doing it.</i>

09:10.174 --> 09:12.677
<i>Even though she's older than me,</i>
<i>she's younger in spirit</i>

09:12.760 --> 09:15.012
<i>because Jan is out here thriving</i>

09:15.096 --> 09:18.266
<i>and I like to sit in the shower. And, so…</i>

09:19.100 --> 09:21.811
<i>It's tough. I do recommend it.</i>
<i>Don't look like that.</i>

09:21.894 --> 09:23.688
<i>Sitting in the shower is perfect.</i>

09:23.771 --> 09:28.401
<i>Sitting in the shower is great</i>
<i>for when you want to be clean,</i>

09:29.110 --> 09:30.570
<i>but you want to rest.</i>

09:30.653 --> 09:32.071
<i>Do you know what I mean?</i>

09:32.154 --> 09:34.532
<i>I love it. I just sit down, honey,</i>

09:34.615 --> 09:36.617
<i>'cause I don't want to stew like a bath.</i>

09:36.701 --> 09:38.953
<i>I don't like that stewing.</i>
<i>So you just sit down.</i>

09:39.036 --> 09:42.331
<i>You relax and then you just have</i>
<i>this water falling on you, sort of.</i>

09:42.415 --> 09:45.501
<i>And it feels</i>
<i>like you're in a '90s R&amp;B video.</i>

09:46.127 --> 09:47.545
<i>And that's beautiful.</i>

09:47.628 --> 09:50.298
<i>That's romantic. That's romantic.</i>

09:50.381 --> 09:51.465
<i>Just for yourself.</i>

09:53.217 --> 09:54.135
<i>But, yeah…</i>

09:54.719 --> 09:56.429
<i>I'm an old soul.</i>

09:56.512 --> 09:59.640
<i>That's what I was called</i>
<i>as a child. Always, always.</i>

09:59.724 --> 10:01.892
<i>I was. Adults would call me an old soul.</i>

10:01.976 --> 10:05.021
<i>Basically, because</i>
<i>I'm not here to play tag. Okay?</i>

10:07.565 --> 10:10.026
<i>I'd be sitting in a corner,</i>
<i>reading one of my books.</i>

10:10.109 --> 10:12.653
<i>Probably </i>Baby-Sitters Club
<i>'cause those girls had jobs.</i>

10:12.737 --> 10:15.072
<i>-[cheering]</i>
<i>-Okay? They did.</i>

10:15.948 --> 10:18.367
<i>I was like, "Entrepreneurial. Yes."</i>

10:20.244 --> 10:22.163
<i>But I always wanted to be an adult.</i>

10:22.246 --> 10:24.332
<i>I loved being around adults</i>
<i>when I was a kid.</i>

10:24.415 --> 10:28.336
<i>I would just look at them and be like,</i>
<i>"Oh! Their eyes are so haunted."</i>

10:29.670 --> 10:31.797
<i>"What have they seen? They're husks."</i>

10:31.881 --> 10:33.674
<i>You know? I was obsessed.</i>

10:34.508 --> 10:36.886
<i>And as an only child of a single mother,</i>

10:36.969 --> 10:39.221
<i>sometimes I would be in the cut,</i>
<i>hanging out.</i>

10:39.305 --> 10:42.016
<i>Mama'd be like,</i>
<i>"We going to Pam's house. Sit down."</i>

10:42.099 --> 10:44.268
<i>See, the Black girls know. You get it. Um…</i>

10:44.352 --> 10:46.354
<i>And so I'd just be sitting there.</i>

10:46.437 --> 10:48.898
<i>And when you're a little kid,</i>
<i>you can kind of sneak in.</i>

10:48.981 --> 10:50.566
<i>The adults forget you're there.</i>

10:50.650 --> 10:53.444
<i>That's my favorite, honey.</i>
<i>I'd just show up with a juice box,</i>

10:53.527 --> 10:55.613
<i>get in the middle</i>
<i>of that kitchen conversation</i>

10:55.696 --> 10:57.990
<i>and be like,</i>
<i>"Gail, did the divorce go through?"</i>

10:59.825 --> 11:01.827
<i>[audience applauds]</i>

11:03.996 --> 11:05.331
<i>I needed it, honey.</i>

11:05.414 --> 11:08.125
<i>Drinking apple juice, getting tea.</i>
<i>That was me.</i>

11:08.209 --> 11:11.212
<i>-[audience cheers]</i>
<i>-That was me from an early age.</i>

11:11.712 --> 11:14.757
<i>And Gail would tell me. Okay?</i>
<i>She needed someone impartial.</i>

11:14.840 --> 11:16.425
<i>So that's why I was there.</i>

11:16.509 --> 11:17.885
<i>It was my favorite.</i>

11:17.968 --> 11:20.930
<i>So, yeah. It's like I'm old in my heart.</i>

11:21.013 --> 11:23.599
<i>Plus, you know why</i>
<i>I'm also kind of old in my heart?</i>

11:23.683 --> 11:26.811
<i>Because I have a lot of rage,</i>
<i>and rage will age you. Okay?</i>

11:26.894 --> 11:28.437
<i>Anger will age you, honey.</i>

11:28.521 --> 11:30.564
<i>All the IBS, honey. That's rage.</i>

11:30.648 --> 11:33.067
<i>IBS is rage. I have it.</i>

11:33.150 --> 11:37.738
<i>It's funny, there's things I'm mad at,</i>
<i>but I don't know what to do about 'em.</i>

11:37.822 --> 11:41.617
<i>So my new thing is just getting mad</i>
<i>at inconsequential shit</i>

11:41.701 --> 11:43.244
<i>that has nothing to do with me.</i>

11:43.327 --> 11:45.871
<i>Does anyone else</i>
<i>like to misplace their rage?</i>

11:45.955 --> 11:48.708
<i>-Because I do it all the time.</i>
<i>-[cheering]</i>

11:48.791 --> 11:49.875
<i>All the time.</i>

11:49.959 --> 11:54.046
<i>And it doesn't help that I'm very nosy</i>
<i>and I like to be in strangers' business.</i>

11:54.130 --> 11:58.092
<i>So that really helps me get mad</i>
<i>about shit that has nothing to do with me.</i>

11:58.175 --> 12:01.053
<i>If I'm in a restaurant</i>
<i>and the couple next to me is fighting,</i>

12:01.137 --> 12:03.055
<i>I'm not leaving 'til I know how it ends.</i>

12:03.806 --> 12:07.017
<i>I'm gonna say that right now.</i>
<i>I'd say, "Hold my check."</i>

12:07.685 --> 12:09.395
<i>"Girl, do you need a ride?"</i>

12:10.479 --> 12:12.606
<i>"You can come live with me</i>
<i>'cause he ain't shit."</i>

12:12.690 --> 12:14.150
<i>Like, that's what I would do.</i>

12:14.650 --> 12:16.485
<i>-[audience cheers]</i>
<i>-I would do that.</i>

12:16.986 --> 12:20.573
<i>I would do that at any time.</i>

12:20.656 --> 12:22.575
<i>And so I'm always finding stuff like…</i>

12:22.658 --> 12:25.661
<i>A prime example of some stuff</i>
<i>that just set me off.</i>

12:26.162 --> 12:29.206
<i>I saw a grown man with a full beard</i>

12:29.290 --> 12:31.167
<i>drinking chocolate milk.</i>

12:32.084 --> 12:34.503
<i>And I became livid. Ugh!</i>

12:35.171 --> 12:38.466
<i>I was in my head like, "What the fuck</i>
<i>you doing drinking chocolate milk?"</i>

12:39.341 --> 12:42.219
<i>"This ain't kindergarten!</i>
<i>Life is not a game."</i>

12:42.303 --> 12:44.972
<i>"The ocean is on fire. Okay?"</i>

12:45.055 --> 12:46.766
<i>"There is fire in the water."</i>

12:46.849 --> 12:49.852
<i>"What you doing drinking chocolate milk</i>
<i>when the ocean is on fire?"</i>

12:49.935 --> 12:52.188
<i>Okay, okay. That's what I'm mad about.</i>

12:52.271 --> 12:53.731
<i>That's what I'm mad about.</i>

12:54.482 --> 12:55.900
<i>There it is, there it is.</i>

12:56.400 --> 12:58.778
<i>Honey, I need</i>

13:10.748 --> 13:14.043
<i>Always. You know, it didn't help</i>
<i>that he was a Caucasian man.</i>

13:15.127 --> 13:19.006
<i>Whenever I see a white man thriving,</i>
<i>I'm always suspect. You know?</i>

13:19.089 --> 13:21.091
<i>I see him, I'm like,</i>
<i>"What are you planning?"</i>

13:21.175 --> 13:22.676
<i>One time I was walking</i>

13:22.760 --> 13:26.555
<i>and there was this young, fit white guy,</i>
<i>and he was jogging</i>

13:26.639 --> 13:28.808
<i>and he was waiting at the light,</i>
<i>for it to change.</i>

13:28.891 --> 13:31.101
<i>So he's jogging.</i>
<i>Gotta keep that heart rate up.</i>

13:31.185 --> 13:34.563
<i>He's not wearing a shirt.</i>
<i>I was like, "Quit bragging." And he…</i>

13:34.647 --> 13:38.734
<i>And he had his ear buds in</i>
<i>and he just was chuckling to himself.</i>

13:38.818 --> 13:40.152
<i>And I just had this vision</i>

13:40.236 --> 13:42.530
<i>of just grabbing</i>
<i>those AirPods out of his ears</i>

13:42.613 --> 13:44.573

<i>"What the hell you laughing at?"</i>

<i>I didn't do it, but I wanted to.</i>

<i>You know why, honey? You know why?</i>

<i>The reason why I don't trust</i>
<i>that white-boy joy,</i>

14:00.214 --> 14:02.174

14:02.258 --> 14:06.053
<i>And I've had this suspect…</i>

14:06.136 --> 14:07.680
<i>I don't trust white men</i>

<i>This is from 1989. Very formative for me.</i>

<i>"Not on our watch. Not our citizens."</i>

<i>I am. I'm a dog mother.</i>

19:43.515 --> 19:46.894
<i>-So that's beautiful. Thank you. Yes.</i>
<i>-[audience applauds]</i>

19:46.977 --> 19:48.228
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

19:48.312 --> 19:49.897
<i>She's gorg. She's gorg.</i>

19:49.980 --> 19:52.107
<i>Um, she's about eight years old.</i>

19:52.191 --> 19:55.986
<i>I've had her for two years.</i>
<i>So, yes, she's a rescue. You're welcome.</i>

19:56.069 --> 19:58.447
<i>Uh, yeah. It's important to say that.</i>

19:58.530 --> 20:01.074
<i>I follow a lot of animal accounts</i>
<i>on Instagram</i>

20:01.158 --> 20:03.827
<i>and people will post a picture</i>
<i>of their animal and be like,</i>

20:03.911 --> 20:05.913
<i>"#WhoRescuedWho?"</i>

20:06.747 --> 20:10.042
<i>It's like, "Um,</i>
<i>I rescued her ass." [scoffs]</i>

20:12.169 --> 20:15.088
<i>I saw her and I said,</i>
<i>"Come with me if you want to live."</i>

20:16.173 --> 20:18.759
<i>That's the dynamic. That's the dynamic.</i>

20:18.842 --> 20:20.844
<i>"Get your nose out your ass. Let's go."</i>

20:22.429 --> 20:24.014
<i>And she is so cute, y'all.</i>

20:24.097 --> 20:27.643
<i>She's this little Maltese Terrier,</i>
<i>pocket-petite angel.</i>

20:27.726 --> 20:29.645
<i>She's gorgeous, she's gorgeous.</i>

20:29.728 --> 20:32.773
<i>The thing I realized,</i>
<i>I realized a week into having this dog,</i>

20:32.856 --> 20:36.485
<i>I can't have a dog that's too fine.</i>
<i>'Cause when you got a fine-ass dog,</i>

20:36.568 --> 20:39.321
<i>people wanna engage with you</i>
<i>out in these streets. Okay?</i>

20:39.404 --> 20:43.283
<i>I'm a curmudgeon and she is gorgeous,</i>
<i>and they wanna get connected.</i>

20:43.367 --> 20:46.620
<i>You know, we walking</i>
<i>and people are like, "Is she friendly?"</i>

20:47.746 --> 20:49.748
<i>And I'm like, "No, I'm not!"</i>

20:49.831 --> 20:50.999
<i>And I walk away.</i>

20:51.083 --> 20:54.086
<i>[audience applauds and cheers]</i>

20:54.169 --> 20:55.212
<i>It's true.</i>

20:57.673 --> 21:00.259
<i>Especially in the morning.</i>
<i>I'm not a morning person.</i>

21:00.342 --> 21:02.844
<i>I really thought the dog</i>
<i>would fix that. You know?</i>

21:02.928 --> 21:06.890
<i>I was like,"If I have a dog, that means</i>
<i>every morning I am waking up early</i>

21:06.974 --> 21:09.518
<i>and starting with a brisk walk." Okay?</i>

21:09.601 --> 21:11.937
<i>Twenty to thirty minutes every morning.</i>

21:12.020 --> 21:14.523
<i>And obviously that'll start</i>
<i>a whole lot of changes.</i>

21:14.606 --> 21:17.651
<i>'Cause after that, I'll come home,</i>
<i>have a sensible breakfast.</i>

21:17.734 --> 21:21.238
<i>Something like half a cantaloupe</i>
<i>with a scoop of cottage cheese.</i>

21:21.321 --> 21:24.616
<i>You know? I was like, I can do that.</i>
<i>And then once I've done that,</i>

21:24.700 --> 21:27.536
<i>yes, finally, learn to play sudoku.</i>

21:27.619 --> 21:29.121
<i>Then I'm doing that.</i>

21:29.204 --> 21:32.541
<i>At which point,</i>
<i>the screenplays will write themselves.</i>

21:32.624 --> 21:35.794
<i>And then after that,</i>
<i>I'm already operating on a high level,</i>

21:35.877 --> 21:39.548
<i>I start to handle the world's problems.</i>
<i>I'm my best self, I'm operating up here.</i>

21:39.631 --> 21:41.300
<i>Now I pick up my phone and I'm like,</i>

21:41.383 --> 21:44.219
<i>"Israel, girl,</i>
<i>I got Palestine on the other line."</i>

21:44.303 --> 21:46.847
<i>-[audience cheers]</i>
<i>-"And we gonna fix this."</i>

<i>"I have been up since 8:00 a.m."</i>

21:57.441 --> 21:59.484
<i>[sighs] Y'all, I had big dreams…</i>

21:59.568 --> 22:00.777
<i>[chuckles awkwardly]</i>

22:00.861 --> 22:02.988
<i>But that ain't what happened.</i>

22:03.071 --> 22:06.658
<i>Every morning, I wake up,</i>
<i>roll over and look at this dog,</i>

22:06.742 --> 22:09.536
<i>and I'm like,</i>
<i>"You can pee in the bed if you want to."</i>

22:10.329 --> 22:12.998
<i>"You might as well.</i>
<i>I can take an extra ten minutes."</i>

22:13.081 --> 22:14.333
<i>"Why not? Why not?"</i>

22:15.125 --> 22:18.295
<i>I'm not a morning person</i>
<i>and I think real dog people,</i>

22:18.378 --> 22:21.089
<i>people who've had a dog</i>
<i>a long time, they're up, honey.</i>

22:21.173 --> 22:24.509
<i>They're up with the sun,</i>
<i>they're step-touching in the morning.</i>

22:24.593 --> 22:28.180
<i>They're out.</i>
<i>They expect eye contact. Okay?</i>

22:28.263 --> 22:30.807
<i>They wanna engage with you</i>
<i>in these streets.</i>

22:30.891 --> 22:34.353
<i>When I'm walking my dog</i>
<i>in the morning, I am bra-less. Okay?</i>

22:34.436 --> 22:35.270
<i>I'm bra-less.</i>

22:35.354 --> 22:37.522
<i>If there's one thing</i>
<i>you need to know about me,</i>

22:37.606 --> 22:40.484
<i>it is don't talk to me</i>

<i>-[audience applauds]</i>

<i>[cheering]</i>

22:58.710 --> 23:00.837
<i>But I love my dog. She's so perfect.</i>

23:00.921 --> 23:04.883
<i>It's so good 'cause she gives me</i>
<i>and Jew-boo, that's my Jewish boo,</i>

23:04.966 --> 23:07.928
<i>something to talk about</i>
<i>after all these years.</i>

23:08.512 --> 23:11.556
<i>[chuckles] We've been together</i>
<i>almost 12 years.</i>

<i>-Yeah. Right? Huge.</i>

23:14.267 --> 23:15.769
<i>Almost 12 years.</i>

<i>And if you count 2020,</i>
<i>we've been together 38 years.</i>

23:18.730 --> 23:22.025
<i>And so it's been a long time.</i>
<i>It's been a long time.</i>

23:22.109 --> 23:25.112
<i>We love each other deeply still.</i>
<i>That's magical.</i>

23:25.195 --> 23:28.407
<i>Um, is anybody else here…</i>
<i>Is anyone here an interracial couple?</i>

23:28.490 --> 23:30.367
<i>-An IRC? Anyone?</i>
<i>-[scattered cheers]</i>

23:30.450 --> 23:34.204
<i>Yes, yes, yes!</i>
<i>This is the future liberals want.</i>

23:34.287 --> 23:35.205
<i>We love it.</i>

23:35.747 --> 23:37.249
<i>Now, I don't know about y'all,</i>

23:37.332 --> 23:39.626
<i>but when me and Jew-boo</i>
<i>are out in these streets,</i>

23:39.709 --> 23:41.837
<i>no one ever thinks we're together.</i>

23:41.920 --> 23:46.174
<i>Okay? They do not fathom</i>
<i>the connection between us two.</i>

23:46.258 --> 23:48.969
<i>Jew-boo thinks</i>
<i>it's because he's a bit shorter than me,</i>

23:49.052 --> 23:51.346
<i>and I'm like… [sighs]</i>
<i>"You're optimistic." Um…</i>

23:54.141 --> 23:57.894
<i>But yes, for the record,</i>
<i>I do stay in a travel-size king. Okay?</i>

23:58.979 --> 24:01.356
<i>You need to get you a boo</i>
<i>that is TSA compliant.</i>

24:01.440 --> 24:05.735
<i>Listen to me.</i>
<i>Pack him in your bag and go. Okay?</i>

24:06.445 --> 24:08.321
<i>But that's not it, 'cause we will be out,</i>

24:08.405 --> 24:11.116
<i>we will walk up</i>
<i>to the host stand at a restaurant,</i>

24:11.199 --> 24:13.785
<i>and the hostess will be like,</i>
<i>"Are you two together?"</i>

24:13.869 --> 24:14.995
<i>"Are you together?"</i>

24:15.078 --> 24:18.915
<i>And it's like, "We're holding hands</i>
<i>and there's no one behind us."</i>

24:19.416 --> 24:20.959
<i>"Yes, we're together!"</i>

24:21.042 --> 24:22.127
<i>She's like, "Huh?"</i>

24:22.210 --> 24:25.464
<i>I'm like, "No. I'm his home health aid</i>
<i>getting him settled."</i>

24:27.048 --> 24:29.176
<i>"We wanted to have an early-bird special."</i>

24:30.343 --> 24:32.596
<i>All the time. All the time.</i>

24:34.139 --> 24:38.435
<i>And also when we go to the grocery store.</i>
<i>Trader Joe's, my favorite place.</i>

24:38.518 --> 24:40.187
<i>Normally a safe space.</i>

24:40.896 --> 24:45.233
<i>But we're in Trader Joe's.</i>
<i>We walk up to the register. Okay?</i>

24:45.317 --> 24:48.570
<i>What's the situation?</i>
<i>Two lovers, one cart.</i>

24:50.155 --> 24:53.533
<i>And we go up</i>
<i>and the cashier looks at Jew-boo.</i>

24:53.617 --> 24:55.410
<i>They always look at Jew-boo first.</i>

24:55.494 --> 24:59.206
<i>They look and check-in with him,</i>
<i>like, "Sir, are you under duress?"</i>

24:59.289 --> 25:01.541
<i>"Blink twice if she's hurting you."</i>

25:01.625 --> 25:03.293
<i>They're very checked-in to him like,</i>

25:03.376 --> 25:06.630
<i>"Sir, are you two together?</i>
<i>Is this your cart?"</i>

25:06.713 --> 25:08.381
<i>And I was in a mood that day.</i>

25:08.465 --> 25:10.425
<i>So I said, "Yes, we together!"</i>

25:10.509 --> 25:13.303
<i>"Last time we kissed</i>
<i>I accidentally burped in his mouth."</i>

25:13.386 --> 25:14.804
<i>"Yes. We are together!"</i>

25:15.680 --> 25:18.683
<i>[audience applauds and cheers]</i>

25:23.021 --> 25:24.981
<i>I didn't burp in his mouth on purpose.</i>

25:26.525 --> 25:30.028
<i>It just happened. After 11 years,</i>
<i>like, you kissing, you feel the burp,</i>

25:30.111 --> 25:33.073
<i>you just don't pull away.</i>
<i>That's it. It's just what happens.</i>

25:33.156 --> 25:34.616
<i>You just decide it. You know?</i>

25:35.242 --> 25:38.578
<i>The most recent one,</i>
<i>the most egregious, was in L.A.</i>

25:38.662 --> 25:42.374
<i>We have a homeless neighbor on our street</i>
<i>because America's a capitalist hellscape</i>

25:42.457 --> 25:45.669
<i>that doesn't take care</i>
<i>of its most vulnerable citizens. And, uh…</i>

25:45.752 --> 25:47.754
<i>[audience cheers]</i>

25:49.089 --> 25:52.968
<i>And he's always on our block.</i>
<i>It's been years. He's our guy.</i>

25:53.051 --> 25:57.097
<i>We say, "Hi. What's up? You want a dollar?</i>
<i>You want some food?" This is the dude.</i>

25:57.180 --> 25:59.975
<i>And there was one day,</i>
<i>Jew-boo was walking alone</i>

26:00.058 --> 26:01.268
<i>and he ran into him.</i>

26:01.768 --> 26:03.103
<i>And this guy goes,</i>

26:03.728 --> 26:05.480
<i>"What happened to your roommate?"</i>

26:06.189 --> 26:07.607
<i>"Where's your roommate?"</i>

26:07.691 --> 26:10.318
<i>"You're always together.</i>
<i>Where's your roommate?"</i>

26:11.027 --> 26:14.823
<i>Now this man</i>
<i>has seen us embrace in the rain</i>

26:14.906 --> 26:18.952
<i>on the street corner</i>
<i>like we're in the end of a Brontë novel.</i>

26:20.954 --> 26:23.039
<i>He know we together. Okay?</i>

26:23.123 --> 26:25.333
<i>He know we together.</i>
<i>He was being messy.</i>

26:27.002 --> 26:28.628
<i>So that's what Jew-boo told him.</i>

26:28.712 --> 26:31.172
<i>"We are together.</i>
<i>That's my partner. We live together."</i>

26:31.256 --> 26:33.633
<i>Then the guy, he goes, "Oh!"</i>

26:33.717 --> 26:35.719
<i>"I had a Black girlfriend once,</i>

26:36.553 --> 26:40.015
<i>but it didn't last 'cause she kept trying</i>
<i>to make me do new stuff."</i>

26:40.557 --> 26:42.767
<i>I said, "Sir, this is why</i>
<i>you're unhoused. Okay?"</i>

26:43.518 --> 26:47.480
<i>"You should've listened</i>
<i>to your Black girlfriend,</i>

26:47.564 --> 26:49.941
<i>'cause, yes,</i>
<i>we will make you do new stuff."</i>

26:50.442 --> 26:53.028
<i>"New stuff like therapy. Okay?"</i>

26:53.111 --> 26:55.113
<i>[audience cheers and applauds]</i>

26:58.825 --> 27:02.662
<i>"New stuff like learning</i>
<i>to wash your sheets. Okay?"</i>

27:03.330 --> 27:06.333
<i>"New stuff like clipping</i>
<i>them toenails. Okay?"</i>

27:06.416 --> 27:08.168
<i>That's what Black girlfriends do.</i>

27:09.169 --> 27:11.755
<i>I wanna make it clear</i>
<i>I'm not mad at him for being unhoused,</i>

27:11.838 --> 27:13.632
<i>I'm mad at him for being a bitch.</i>

27:15.634 --> 27:17.260
<i>Jeremy was being very rude.</i>

27:18.136 --> 27:19.012
<i>His name is Jeremy.</i>

27:19.095 --> 27:21.222
<i>I should've said that up top.</i>
<i>Jeremy. Rude.</i>

27:21.306 --> 27:24.559
<i>[sighs] God, he was like,</i>
<i>"Are you together? Your roommate?"</i>

27:24.643 --> 27:26.019
<i>Ugh, Jer…</i>

27:26.102 --> 27:29.397
<i>Um, but it's crazy</i>
<i>'cause people don't think we're together.</i>

27:29.481 --> 27:30.440
<i>So that's one side.</i>

27:30.523 --> 27:33.151
<i>And the other side</i>
<i>swings totally opposite,</i>

27:33.234 --> 27:35.612
<i>and they're obsessed with us having kids.</i>

27:35.695 --> 27:38.865
<i>Whoo, they want us to have kids</i>
<i>'cause I'm Black and he's white.</i>

27:38.948 --> 27:40.367
<i>Ooh, everyone's so excited.</i>

27:40.867 --> 27:44.454
<i>They're like, "When will you have babies?</i>
<i>Your babies are gonna be gorgeous."</i>

27:44.537 --> 27:46.831
<i>"You've gotta have babies!</i>
<i>They'll be gorgeous."</i>

27:46.915 --> 27:50.043
<i>"Oh my God! When are you having babies?</i>
<i>They'll be gorgeous!"</i>

27:50.126 --> 27:54.047
<i>[exhales] And it's like, "Y'all,</i>
<i>why is everybody so horny for this baby</i>

27:54.130 --> 27:56.800
<i>just 'cause it's gonna be beige?</i>
<i>I don't understand."</i>

27:57.926 --> 27:59.928
<i>Why? Why?</i>

28:00.011 --> 28:02.722
<i>They all look like baked potatoes</i>
<i>when they come out.</i>

28:05.934 --> 28:09.521
<i>Plus, I'm like… I don't have</i>
<i>an impulse to have a baby.</i>

28:09.604 --> 28:11.356
<i>Like to… To make one.</i>

28:11.439 --> 28:14.776
<i>Like maybe I'd adopt a teenager,</i>
<i>you know, a kid I could put to work.</i>

28:15.568 --> 28:18.613
<i>But I don't feel like… I don't know.</i>

28:18.697 --> 28:20.615
<i>I've never had this sense of like,</i>

28:20.699 --> 28:24.244
<i>"We must preserve the DNA</i>
<i>in the bloodline." You know?</i>

28:24.327 --> 28:26.329
<i>Y'all, I have clinical depression,</i>

28:26.413 --> 28:29.374
<i>I am half blind,</i>
<i>and I've had braces twice.</i>

28:29.457 --> 28:33.002
<i>So I think it's safe to say</i>
<i>the bloodline ends here.</i>

28:33.086 --> 28:34.129
<i>Don't you think?</i>

28:34.879 --> 28:37.006
<i>It's all recessive from here on out.</i>

28:37.632 --> 28:39.217
<i>And you're welcome. [laughs]</i>

28:39.843 --> 28:40.969
<i>I don't want to.</i>

28:41.052 --> 28:44.097
<i>Plus, it's like, I'm old inside.</i>
<i>I can't raise a child.</i>

28:44.180 --> 28:45.849
<i>I don't have that kind of energy.</i>

28:46.474 --> 28:49.644
<i>[sighs] Okay, everybody.</i>
<i>Let me see, let me see.</i>

28:49.728 --> 28:52.522
<i>I was gonna ask</i>
<i>how many of you are over 30.</i>

28:52.605 --> 28:55.817
<i>-[cheering]</i>
<i>-Wow, wow, wow.</i>

28:55.900 --> 28:58.194
<i>A lot of friends, a lot of friends.</i>

28:58.695 --> 29:00.280
<i>Gorgeous, gorgeous.</i>

29:00.363 --> 29:02.115
<i>Everyone under 30, don't say a word</i>

29:02.198 --> 29:05.910
<i>because I can see the light</i>
<i>in your eyes reflected back at me.</i>

29:05.994 --> 29:09.622
<i>You don't need to. Okay, my over-thirties,</i>
<i>since I know there's a lot of you.</i>

29:09.706 --> 29:10.790
<i>-[cheering]</i>
<i>-Wow.</i>

29:10.874 --> 29:13.126
<i>You're far too excited</i>
<i>for someone over 30.</i>

29:14.586 --> 29:16.045
<i>But I will say this, though.</i>

29:16.129 --> 29:19.799
<i>My over-thirties, have you ever had</i>
<i>a moment where you heard somebody talk</i>

29:19.883 --> 29:21.968
<i>and you were like, "You're 22."</i>

29:23.219 --> 29:26.222
<i>-[audience applauds]</i>
<i>-"Yeah. Yeah, you're little."</i>

29:27.223 --> 29:28.683
<i>That happened to me in L.A.</i>

29:28.767 --> 29:32.103
<i>I was walking and I overheard</i>
<i>these two young white women. All right?</i>

29:32.187 --> 29:34.272
<i>I overheard them talking.</i>
<i>I didn't hear much.</i>

29:34.355 --> 29:36.775
<i>Two lines between them.</i>
<i>A couplet, if you will.</i>

29:37.275 --> 29:39.527
<i>Um, and yet it was so rich,</i>

29:39.611 --> 29:41.946
<i>it told me everything I needed to know.</i>

29:42.030 --> 29:44.282
<i>And it was legit.</i>
<i>Just one girl, real casual.</i>

29:44.365 --> 29:47.035
<i>She's not stressed.</i>
<i>She just goes, "Ugh, I feel fat."</i>

29:47.118 --> 29:50.497
<i>And her friend goes,</i>
<i>"Shut up! You're gorgeous!"</i>

29:52.165 --> 29:54.834
<i>Okay, baby girl. [laughs] Like…</i>

29:55.585 --> 29:59.047
<i>Calm down.</i>
<i>That, to me, is early-twenties shit.</i>

29:59.130 --> 30:02.175
<i>Okay? That's what you do</i>
<i>when you just started paying rent</i>

30:02.258 --> 30:03.635
<i>and are excited about it.</i>

30:03.718 --> 30:04.719
<i>You know?</i>

30:04.803 --> 30:06.805
<i>Like, "I bought this tapestry."</i>

30:06.888 --> 30:08.598
<i>You know? That's the energy.</i>

30:09.808 --> 30:12.769
<i>I'm in my thirties. Me and my friends</i>
<i>don't talk like that anymore.</i>

30:12.852 --> 30:14.771
<i>If someone goes, "I feel fat."</i>

30:14.854 --> 30:16.940
<i>The rest of us are like, "Bitch, me too."</i>

30:17.899 --> 30:19.400
<i>I can't lift you up.</i>

30:20.985 --> 30:22.862
<i>I'm out in these streets struggling.</i>

30:24.572 --> 30:26.574
<i>What I can do for you in my thirties</i>

30:26.658 --> 30:29.661
<i>is make you a sandwich. Okay?</i>
<i>I can make you a hot meal,</i>

30:29.744 --> 30:33.498
<i>but I cannot bring you back</i>
<i>from the brink. No, I cannot.</i>

30:34.374 --> 30:37.377
<i>But when you in your early twenties,</i>
<i>that love is aggressive.</i>

30:37.460 --> 30:40.797
<i>You be coming in hot. You be like,</i>
<i>"Shut up, girl. You're a queen!"</i>

30:42.507 --> 30:45.176
<i>And it's like, "No, baby.</i>
<i>You an administrative assistant."</i>

30:45.260 --> 30:47.262
<i>[audience cheers and applauds]</i>

30:50.014 --> 30:50.974
<i>You…</i>

30:52.350 --> 30:55.311
<i>You're not a queen until you can look</i>
<i>somebody in the eye and say,</i>

30:55.395 --> 30:57.105
<i>"I need a vacation from Maui."</i>

30:57.188 --> 30:58.857
