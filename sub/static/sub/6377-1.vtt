00:28.613 --> 00:30.274
What the hell are you doing?

00:30.448 --> 00:32.279
I'm bored.

00:32.950 --> 00:34.565
You get bored
pretty easily.

00:34.744 --> 00:37.156
Only with you, darling.

00:45.087 --> 00:46.702
Holy shit, V. Stop.

01:00.436 --> 01:03.894
We 're citizens. We pay taxes.
We deserve basic civil rights...

01:04.065 --> 01:05.305
just like everyone else.

01:05.483 --> 01:09.101
Yeah, but-- I mean, come on. Doesn't
your race have a rather sordid history...

01:09.278 --> 01:13.738
...of exploiting and feeding off
innocent people for centuries?

01:13.908 --> 01:15.193
Three points.

01:15.368 --> 01:17.609
Number one,
show me documentation.

01:17.787 --> 01:19.402
It doesn't exist.

01:19.580 --> 01:23.539
Number two, doesn't your race
have a history of exploitation?

01:23.709 --> 01:27.577
We never owned slaves, Bill,
or detonated nuclear weapons.

01:27.755 --> 01:30.622
Most importantly, point number three.
Now that the Japanese...

01:30.800 --> 01:33.667
...have pen‘ected synthetic blood,
which satisﬁes our needs...

01:33.844 --> 01:36.631
...there is no reason
for anyone to fear us.

01:37.181 --> 01:39.638
I can assure you that every member
of our community...

01:39.809 --> 01:41.845
...is now drinking synthetic blood.

01:42.019 --> 01:44.305
That's why we decided
to make our existence known.

01:44.480 --> 01:47.267
We just wanna be part
of mainstream society.

01:48.442 --> 01:50.023
Well. . ..

01:56.325 --> 01:57.735
Hi.

01:57.910 --> 01:59.775
Y'all have Tru Blood.

01:59.954 --> 02:01.865
For real.

02:02.039 --> 02:03.119
You get vamps in here?

02:03.291 --> 02:05.282
I didn't even think we had any
in Louisiana.

02:05.459 --> 02:06.995
You didn't know...

02:07.169 --> 02:10.878
...that New Orleans
is a Mecca for the vampire?

02:11.048 --> 02:13.300
Seriously? I mean, New Orleans?

02:13.467 --> 02:15.879
Even after Katrina? Didn't they all drown?

02:16.053 --> 02:18.715
Vampires cannot drown.

02:18.889 --> 02:20.720
Because we do not breathe.

02:24.145 --> 02:26.636
Dude, no harm intended.

02:29.025 --> 02:33.519
-We're just a little drunk.
-Nice. I could use a cocktail.

02:40.161 --> 02:43.779
Score. I totally had you guys.

02:44.707 --> 02:46.413
-That wasn't funny.
-Yeah, it was.

02:46.584 --> 02:48.575
No, Kelly, that was pretty funny.

02:48.753 --> 02:50.163
ldidn't think it was funny.

02:50.588 --> 02:53.045
What? Well, we don't care
what you think.

02:54.633 --> 02:56.919
Dude, you know where
we can score any V-juice?

02:57.094 --> 02:59.005
-Gross. Brad, no.
-How much you need?

02:59.180 --> 03:02.923
I knew this girl who knew this girl,
who did vamp blood during Greek Week.

03:03.100 --> 03:05.557
She, like, clawed her own face off.

03:05.728 --> 03:08.094
Seriously, I can pay good money.

03:08.272 --> 03:11.560
Okay. You two need to leave.

03:11.734 --> 03:14.225
All right. Fuck you, Billy Bob.

03:14.403 --> 03:15.609
Fuck me?

03:16.447 --> 03:18.233
l'll fuck you, boy.

03:18.407 --> 03:22.400
l'll fuck you, and then I'll eat you.

03:42.765 --> 03:44.801
You ever pretend to be one of us again...

03:47.436 --> 03:49.597
...and I'll kill you.

03:50.606 --> 03:51.812
Got it?

03:52.733 --> 03:54.269
Yeah.

03:55.403 --> 03:57.485
Have a nice day, now.

05:35.836 --> 05:38.077
Dawn, take the catfish.

05:38.255 --> 05:39.870
Thank you, baby.

05:40.049 --> 05:41.710
You know daddy loves you.

05:41.884 --> 05:45.172
Bill, I'm sitting down here, okay?
I'm by myself.

05:46.096 --> 05:49.088
Just let me have
just one beer tonight, Jesus.

05:49.266 --> 05:52.850
One beer, that's all I need.
And if you just give me the strength...

05:53.020 --> 05:56.433
...to say no to beer number two,
then / swear...

05:57.191 --> 06:00.775
--in the face without a second thought.
Don’t you gripe about me eating fries.

06:00.945 --> 06:03.482
Not after what I did for you
last night in the bedroom.

06:03.656 --> 06:07.148
Which, by the way, was disgusting.
Although I kind of enjoyed it.

06:08.661 --> 06:11.118
Who are these people,
and what the hell is this music?

06:11.288 --> 06:14.246
I feel like I'm trapped
in some hillbilly's OxyContin nightmare.

06:14.416 --> 06:17.078
Man, I cannot wait to get the hell out
of this Podunk town.

06:17.169 --> 06:21.879
Make sure you do, and before it's too late.
Every year you just get more stuck here.

06:22.049 --> 06:22.799
Believe me, I know.

06:22.800 --> 06:23.789
Believe me, I know.
How’d she know what I was thinking?

06:23.801 --> 06:24.790
How’d she know what I was thinking?

06:24.969 --> 06:27.176
That's weird.
Did she hear my thoughts?

06:27.346 --> 06:29.758
-Does he have a girlfriend?
-Am I thinking out loud?

06:29.932 --> 06:31.342
Please, God.

06:31.517 --> 06:32.927
I'll get y'all some ketchup.

06:33.102 --> 06:35.309
Shit, did my parents... ?

06:42.236 --> 06:46.070
I don’t know, but I’m not gonna pee.
I'll probably pee in my pants.

06:56.125 --> 06:58.161
Welcome to
Super Save-A-Bunch.

06:58.335 --> 07:01.998
Hi. I'm looking for that thick,
translucent plastic sheeting.

07:02.172 --> 07:06.006
The kind they hang in front of the doors
of walk-in refrigerators.

07:06.176 --> 07:09.259
We don't sell that here.
You could try Home Depot.

07:10.222 --> 07:12.178
I tried them already. They sent me here.

07:12.850 --> 07:15.307
Now, I cannot believe
you don't have that stuff.

07:15.477 --> 07:19.015
-Oh, I don't even know what it's called.
-Sorry.

07:19.189 --> 07:22.647
-But you're supposed to have everything.
-Well, we don't have that stuff...

07:22.818 --> 07:24.854
...that you don't even know
what it's called.

07:25.029 --> 07:29.022
Your website says that this is
the most well-stocked store in five parishes.

07:29.199 --> 07:32.942
Now, | just drove over an hour
from Marthaville--

07:33.120 --> 07:36.863
-Does our website have a phone number?
-Well, I suppose it does, but--

07:37.041 --> 07:39.623
So it never occurred to you
before you drove an hour...

07:39.793 --> 07:44.127
...to pick up the phone and call us to see if
we stocked whatever you're looking for?

07:44.298 --> 07:47.381
Well, I think that if a business chooses
to classify itself as--

07:47.551 --> 07:50.884
Why didn't you just find it online,
and have it delivered to your house?

07:51.055 --> 07:54.297
Or were you just looking for an excuse
to wear them ugly-ass clothes?

07:57.645 --> 08:00.808
I would like to speak
to your manager.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.565
Fine.

08:05.736 --> 08:07.727
Waylon!

08:09.948 --> 08:12.075
Trust me, you are not getting me fired.

08:12.242 --> 08:15.075
I am quitting.
You were just the fucking catalyst...

08:15.245 --> 08:16.985
...and for that I ought to thank you.

08:17.164 --> 08:19.325
You are a very rude young woman.

08:19.500 --> 08:23.038
Oh, this ain't rude. This is uppity.

08:23.796 --> 08:26.583
That's for patting my ass.
I'm gonna get my baby daddy...

08:26.757 --> 08:29.749
...who just got out of prison
to come and kick your teeth in.

08:29.927 --> 08:32.964
-Jesus, Tara. Please don't do any--
-Oh, my God.

08:33.138 --> 08:35.754
I'm not serious, you pathetic racist.

08:35.933 --> 08:37.764
I don't have a baby.

08:39.103 --> 08:40.263
Damn.

08:40.437 --> 08:43.554
I know y'all have to be stupid,
but do you have to be that stupid?

08:43.732 --> 08:46.724
Shit. Fuck this job.

08:50.239 --> 08:52.195
Evening. Merlotte's.

08:53.075 --> 08:54.986
Hey, Tara.

08:55.160 --> 08:57.742
Yeah, she's right here.

08:57.913 --> 08:59.028
I'm so sorry, Sam.

08:59.206 --> 09:00.742
She knows not to call me at work.

09:00.916 --> 09:04.124
Sookie, it's okay.
You don't abuse a privilege like Arlene does.

09:04.294 --> 09:07.252
-Hey. I heard that.
-Well, | wish you would hear that.

09:07.423 --> 09:09.459
Please. Sam, I have kids.

09:09.633 --> 09:11.874
This had better be an emergency.

09:12.052 --> 09:14.714
-| just '
qunt m '
-Again? y JOb.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.424
I can't work for assholes.

09:16.598 --> 09:19.556
I'm glad you can be so picky,
Miss Say-Hello-To-The-Rest-Of—Us.

09:19.727 --> 09:23.436
Oh, shut up. Sam is not an asshole,
and he's totally in love with you.

09:23.605 --> 09:26.221
Tara, he is my boss.

09:27.317 --> 09:29.774
Jesus. Sookie, you need to lighten up.

09:29.945 --> 09:31.936
You know I hate it
when you use the J word.

09:32.114 --> 09:33.274
Now, I gotta go.

09:34.074 --> 09:36.486
I'm coming over. I need a margarita.

09:36.660 --> 09:37.740
A big one.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.867
Bye.

09:43.584 --> 09:47.623
Mack and Denise Rattray
are just about to sit down in your section.

09:49.631 --> 09:51.587
What the fuck?

09:54.178 --> 09:56.134
Don't let them get to you, chere.

09:56.305 --> 09:58.170
They're not worth it.

10:00.184 --> 10:01.674
Two Tecates, Sam.

10:01.852 --> 10:05.060
Hell, there ain't nothing on this menu
ain’t gonna give me the runs.

10:05.230 --> 10:08.267
Goddamn son of a--

10:08.442 --> 10:09.352
What can I do for y'all tonight?

10:09.359 --> 10:10.314
What can I do for y'all tonight?

10:10.319 --> 10:10.774
You can wrap your lips...

10:10.944 --> 10:13.526
...around my slim reaper.
That's what you can do.

10:13.614 --> 10:16.356
Why don't we just start out
with a pitcher of Bud?

10:16.533 --> 10:20.697
You can hop aboard the Mack express
and ride all the way to heaven.

10:20.871 --> 10:22.202
Alrighty. Anything else?

Onion rings, with mustard.
...that’s been kicked too many times
and keeps coming back for more.

10:26.627 --> 10:28.208
...that’s been kicked too many times
and keeps coming back for more.

10:28.212 --> 10:28.871
Corning right up.
...that’s been kicked too many times

10:28.879 --> 10:29.368
Corning right up.

10:34.009 --> 10:35.715
I think she's retarded.

10:35.886 --> 10:39.424
Honey, if Rene tells you you're too young
to watch a scary movie on HBO...

10:39.598 --> 10:41.805
...then I'm siding with him.

10:43.352 --> 10:44.717
I know he's not your daddy...

10:44.895 --> 10:48.808
...but your daddy does not wanna
live with us anymore. Remember?

10:52.569 --> 10:55.902
You want a time-out? Because I can give
you one. I'd be fine with it.

10:56.073 --> 11:00.032
Onion rings. And if you drop a few of them
on the floor, that's fine with me.

11:00.202 --> 11:01.988
Got it.

11:02.162 --> 11:04.824
Oh, Sookie.

11:06.708 --> 11:08.790
You're looking like a porn star
with that tan.

11:08.961 --> 11:12.249
And pink lipstick. You got a date?

11:12.422 --> 11:15.084
No. When I wear makeup,
| get bigger tips.

11:17.094 --> 11:18.209
Yes, girl, that's it.

11:18.387 --> 11:21.379
These damn rednecks
are suckers for packaging.

11:21.557 --> 11:25.015
And | get even bigger tips when I act
like I don't have a brain in my head.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.176
But, if I don't, they're all scared of me.

11:27.354 --> 11:30.141
They ain't scared of you, honey child.

11:30.315 --> 11:32.397
They scared of
what's between your legs.

11:32.568 --> 11:35.651
Lafayette. That's nasty talk.
I won't listen to that.

11:35.821 --> 11:39.063
Do you even know what's between
a woman's legs, Lafayette?

11:39.241 --> 11:42.574
I know every man, whether straight, gay,
or George motherfucking Bush...

11:42.744 --> 11:45.121
...is terrified of the pussy.

11:45.289 --> 11:47.780
-Lafayette.
-Oh, what are we talking about?

11:47.958 --> 11:50.620
-Pussy.
-Hey, listen, not everybody is gay, okay?

11:50.794 --> 11:52.785
Not everybody wants to have sex
with you.

11:52.963 --> 11:55.796
Oh, you would be surprised,
Arlene. People you know.

11:58.051 --> 12:01.168
-That's all I'm saying.
-Well, I don't wanna have sex with you.

12:01.346 --> 12:02.961
-Me neither.
-Shit. You bitches...

12:03.140 --> 12:06.598
...just don't know what you're missing.
I got six gears on these hips.

12:06.768 --> 12:08.975
No, baby.
You don't know what you're missing.

12:09.146 --> 12:11.137
Watch her walk away.
Make you wanna slap it?

12:11.315 --> 12:13.431
-Huh, you wanna slap it?
-Everybody knows that.

12:13.609 --> 12:15.474
Everybody been there. John's been there.

12:15.652 --> 12:18.735
I'm slapping it. Take these, baby.
Peaches and cream.

12:18.906 --> 12:21.238
I'll give you a little cocoa.
Little cocoa.

12:21.408 --> 12:23.569
Ain't that right, John? Shit.

12:24.286 --> 12:27.824
Look, I’m a pretty nice guy, but I have,
like, a little bit of an edge to me.

12:27.998 --> 12:29.579
Got started at a young age.

12:29.750 --> 12:32.162
-Started getting into ﬁghts.
-Really?

12:32.336 --> 12:36.545
Used to get into a lot of trouble. Got kicked
out of a couple schools, type of thing.

12:36.715 --> 12:40.799
Yeah. Started partying in high school.

12:41.678 --> 12:44.841
Yes, yes.

12:57.361 --> 12:59.818
What the fuck is this?

13:01.073 --> 13:05.112
It's just a mosquito bite.

13:06.411 --> 13:08.447
You had sex with a vampire?

13:09.873 --> 13:11.864
Okay. Once.

13:12.751 --> 13:17.040
I went to that vampire bar
down in Shreveport.

13:17.506 --> 13:22.170
Look. l was broke,
and he paid me a lot of money.

13:28.809 --> 13:30.549
You a hooker, Maudette?

13:31.186 --> 13:33.518
Because I don't pay for it.
Never have, never will.

13:33.689 --> 13:35.930
Well, I don't charge for it, neither.

13:36.108 --> 13:38.724
I mean, he offered me a thousand dollars
to bite me.

13:38.902 --> 13:41.644
What was I gonna do?
Say no to a thousand bucks?

13:44.992 --> 13:46.857
What was it like?

13:48.245 --> 13:50.486
Scary.

13:52.582 --> 13:55.415
You know, I read in Hustler
everybody should have sex...

13:55.585 --> 13:58.748
...with a vampire at least once
before they die.

13:58.922 --> 14:00.458
Once was enough for me.

14:00.632 --> 14:02.918
He was way too rough.

14:03.093 --> 14:06.756
I mean, I like to be rough sometimes,
but--

14:06.930 --> 14:10.047
-You like it rough?
-Yeah.

14:10.475 --> 14:12.727
Why not?

14:12.894 --> 14:15.271
You know, it's not like it's gonna kill me.

14:15.439 --> 14:20.399
And if it does, well,
then I won't care, will I?

14:29.077 --> 14:31.784
Right. Well....

14:33.623 --> 14:35.284
l videotaped it.

14:37.377 --> 14:38.492
What?

14:38.670 --> 14:40.911
With the vampire.

14:46.053 --> 14:48.214
You wanna watch?

14:55.604 --> 14:56.969
My life sucks.

14:57.147 --> 14:59.388
Oh, Tara, don't you be feeling
sorry for yourself.

14:59.566 --> 15:01.932
-That's just lazy.
-Well, why can't I keep a job?

15:02.110 --> 15:03.975
Because you can't keep your mouth shut.

15:04.154 --> 15:05.985
Bitch, who asked you?

15:07.574 --> 15:09.405
How you doing, Sookie?

15:09.951 --> 15:11.202
I've had better nights.

15:11.369 --> 15:15.237
Yeah? Anything I can do
to improve this one for you?

15:54.830 --> 15:56.366
Oh, my God.

15:56.540 --> 15:58.872
I think Merlotte's
just got its first vampire.

15:59.042 --> 16:00.782
I think you're right.

16:00.961 --> 16:04.249
Can you believe it?
Right here in Bon Temps?

16:04.422 --> 16:08.665
I've been waiting for this to happen since
they came out of the coffin two years ago.

16:15.267 --> 16:18.725
Hi, and what--?
What can I get for you tonight?

16:19.437 --> 16:22.975
Do you have any of that
synthetic bottled blood?

16:24.484 --> 16:26.065
No, I'm so sorry.

16:26.236 --> 16:29.148
Sam got some a year ago,
but nobody ever ordered it...

16:29.322 --> 16:30.482
...so it went bad.

16:33.034 --> 16:35.446
You're our first.

16:35.620 --> 16:37.406
Vampire.

16:39.374 --> 16:40.989
Am I that obvious?

16:41.168 --> 16:45.252
I knew the minute you came in. I can't
believe nobody else around here seems to.

16:45.422 --> 16:47.253
He does.

16:49.134 --> 16:51.090
Oh, don't worry about Sam. He's cool.

16:51.261 --> 16:53.673
I know he supports
the Vampire Rights Amendment.

16:53.847 --> 16:56.008
How progressive of him.

17:01.813 --> 17:03.769
Well...

17:03.940 --> 17:07.603
...anything else you drink?

17:08.320 --> 17:10.356
Actually, no.

17:12.282 --> 17:16.275
But you can get me a glass of red wine,
so I have a reason to be here.

17:18.163 --> 17:22.657
Well, whatever the reason...

17:24.377 --> 17:26.413
...l'm glad you are.

17:27.547 --> 17:30.459
Don't mind Sookie none, mister.

17:30.634 --> 17:33.046
She's crazy as a bedbug.

17:33.803 --> 17:36.055
I'll just get your wine for you.

17:41.311 --> 17:43.597
My name's Mack Rattray...

17:44.189 --> 17:47.773
...and this here is my wife, Denise.

17:47.943 --> 17:49.979
Hello.

17:51.738 --> 17:53.649
Good evening.

18:45.834 --> 18:47.449
What a bitch.

18:48.086 --> 18:51.374
You really think that
she's gonna let him bite her?

18:51.548 --> 18:55.166
You know how many people are having sex
with vampires these days?

18:55.343 --> 18:58.176
-And sometimes those people disappear.
-No.

18:59.180 --> 19:02.217
-He's not like that.
-Okay, okay, you spoke to him for a minute.

19:02.392 --> 19:04.383
You don't know how many people
he sucked...

19:04.561 --> 19:07.098
...over the last however
many centuries he's been alive.

19:07.272 --> 19:10.639
-But he's so not scary.
-Sweet Jesus in heaven, he is a vampire.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.899
Yeah, but the synthetic blood
has everything--

19:13.069 --> 19:15.355
Are you willing to pass up
your favorite foods...

19:15.530 --> 19:18.397
...and spend the rest of your life
drinking Slim-Fast?

19:20.577 --> 19:24.411
I mean, people have always
discriminated against me.

19:24.581 --> 19:26.492
Oh, boy, have they ever.

19:26.666 --> 19:28.657
And just because I never felt like being...

19:28.835 --> 19:31.201
...what society wanted me to be,
you know?

19:31.379 --> 19:32.755
Me neither.

19:32.922 --> 19:33.911
Me neither.

19:34.090 --> 19:37.253
So we know what it's been like for you.

19:40.930 --> 19:43.262
Can I get y'all anything else?

19:43.433 --> 19:44.468
Not big, but he’s got 11 or 12 pints in him.

19:44.476 --> 19:45.636
I'm fine.
Not big, but he’s got 11 or 12 pints in him.

19:45.643 --> 19:46.268
Not big, but he’s got 11 or 12 pints in him.

19:46.436 --> 19:48.552
Holy shit, that’s almost 200 ounces.

19:48.730 --> 19:50.595
I bet we could get 500 an ounce
in Dallas.

19:50.774 --> 19:53.891
Fuck me, that's $10,000. Sweet Jesus.

19:54.069 --> 19:55.934
I'm gonna bring y'all
a free round of beer, okay?

19:56.112 --> 19:58.273
What the hell is your problem,
you dimwitted country--?

19:58.281 --> 19:59.191
What the hell is your problem,
you dimwitted country--?

19:59.199 --> 19:59.358
Don't you go anywhere.

19:59.366 --> 19:59.946

I guess you are retarded.
Just like everybody says you are.

20:05.872 --> 20:08.614
-Tara. Tara, we have to stop them.
-Stop who? Why?

20:08.792 --> 20:12.455
The Rattrays. They're gonna drain him
and sell his blood. We have to stop them.

20:12.629 --> 20:15.462
We do not. We don't have to get
anywhere near that vampire.

20:15.632 --> 20:18.624
Tara, I am very disappointed in
you and your small-mindedness.

20:18.802 --> 20:20.463
SooMe.

20:20.637 --> 20:23.845
The vampire can take care of himself.
I promise you.

20:25.809 --> 20:27.765
Shit.

20:29.562 --> 20:31.814
-Tara, you know how to tend bar?
-No.

20:31.981 --> 20:33.767
Fakeit

20:33.942 --> 20:34.977
Shit.

20:46.121 --> 20:49.864
Look at this. This is so thick.
Damn, this is gonna bring a pretty penny.

20:50.041 --> 20:53.158
We should keep some for ourselves.
If Mack freaks out on me again...

20:53.336 --> 20:55.702
...I am so through with him.

21:22.657 --> 21:24.488
You like this?

21:24.659 --> 21:26.320
Being punished?

21:26.911 --> 21:28.697
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

21:28.872 --> 21:32.456
You're a sick little vampire fucker.

21:32.625 --> 21:34.957
You like that, Pickens?

21:36.296 --> 21:38.082
Come on.

21:38.256 --> 21:39.871
-Yeah.
-You look at me.

21:40.049 --> 21:43.177
Look at me.
You let a dead man fuck you?

21:43.344 --> 21:44.424
Yeah.

21:44.596 --> 21:46.803
Fucking disgust rne.

21:46.973 --> 21:49.089
Yeah. Yes.

21:49.267 --> 21:51.383
It's too bad I don't have fangs, huh?

21:51.561 --> 21:54.394
-Yeah.
-l'd rip your fucking throat out.

22:06.910 --> 22:08.195
Hurry.

22:08.369 --> 22:10.405
We should've taken him home.

22:10.580 --> 22:13.822
Too dangerous. Where are we gonna hide
a dead vampire in our trailer?

22:14.000 --> 22:17.413
Well, at least we wouldn't
be out in the fucking open like this.

22:17.587 --> 22:19.578
| just need some V-juice.
I need it bad.

22:19.756 --> 22:22.589
My body is starting to hurt,
and ljust need to get it in me.

22:22.759 --> 22:25.501
Goddamn it, Mack,
you're a drug addict, do you know that?

22:25.678 --> 22:28.795
Woman, would you just
shut the fuck up?

22:28.973 --> 22:33.592
Sometimes, when you talk,
this is what I hear:

22:33.770 --> 22:35.260
Mack.

22:39.275 --> 22:40.856
You crazy bitch.

22:56.793 --> 22:58.875
This ain't your business,
you stupid cunt.

22:59.045 --> 23:02.629
Now, see, that just proves
how low-rent you really are.

23:03.508 --> 23:07.126
Do you have any idea
who you're messing with?

23:07.804 --> 23:09.965
You don't wanna be on my bad side.

23:10.139 --> 23:15.133
I'm not so sure you even have another side,
you no-account, backwoods trash.

23:22.485 --> 23:25.602
Do not even think
about taking that blood.

23:27.824 --> 23:30.566
I will kill you for this.

23:31.244 --> 23:34.486
Get out. Now.

23:35.582 --> 23:37.197
Come on, Mac.

23:41.296 --> 23:43.662
This ain't over. Come on.

23:43.840 --> 23:45.580
Yeah, yeah.

23:45.758 --> 23:46.918
Get up, Mack.

23:47.093 --> 23:49.254
Why can't you take
that fucking thing off?

23:49.429 --> 23:50.965
I ain't got time for a cripple...

23:51.139 --> 23:53.846
...because I'm getting out of here
one way or the other.

24:25.089 --> 24:27.831
Shutup.

24:31.054 --> 24:34.967
-Quick, with your feet.
-ngetyou,bﬂch!

24:39.062 --> 24:40.723
Oh, bless your heart.

24:41.481 --> 24:45.144
I am so sorry I didn't get here faster.

24:45.318 --> 24:47.900
You'll be okay in a minute, right?

24:51.240 --> 24:54.232
-Do you want me to leave?
-No.

24:55.828 --> 24:57.910
They might come back
and I can't fight yet.

25:02.835 --> 25:04.371
Well, hey, there, dog.

25:16.391 --> 25:17.551
He's checking on you.

25:17.725 --> 25:21.263
That's just some old dog
that hangs around the bar sometimes.

25:21.437 --> 25:22.768
He must live nearby.

25:23.981 --> 25:25.767
Well, no doubt.

25:31.614 --> 25:34.856
I reckon you're not too happy
about being rescued by a woman.

25:37.537 --> 25:38.777
Thank you.

25:53.636 --> 25:55.297
I can't hear you.

25:56.681 --> 25:57.796
Thank you.

25:57.974 --> 26:01.011
No,no,no.
I can hear you, but I can't--

26:06.941 --> 26:10.308
Oh, my stars.

26:11.487 --> 26:15.605
Aren't you afraid to be out here alone
with a hungry vampire?

26:15.783 --> 26:16.989
No.

26:17.827 --> 26:21.740
Vampires often turn on those
who trust them, you know?

26:22.832 --> 26:25.824
We don't have human values like you.

26:26.002 --> 26:29.085
A lot of humans turn on those
who trust them too.

26:32.300 --> 26:34.632
I'm not a total fool.

26:35.595 --> 26:39.338
Oh, but you have other very juicy arteries.

26:42.059 --> 26:44.971
There is one in the groin that's
a particular favorite of mine.

26:45.146 --> 26:48.183
Hey, you just shut your nasty mouth.
You might be a vampire...

26:48.357 --> 26:51.815
...but when you talk to me, you will
talk to me like the lady that I am.

27:01.704 --> 27:04.867
-You wanna drink the blood they collected?
-No.

27:05.291 --> 27:08.875
I understand it makes humans
feel more healthy.

27:09.712 --> 27:11.794
Improves their sex life.

27:11.964 --> 27:13.670
I'm as healthy as a horse.

27:13.841 --> 27:16.378
And I have no sex life to speak of, so--

27:19.597 --> 27:22.464
You can just keep it.

27:26.270 --> 27:27.646
You could always sell it.

27:28.981 --> 27:31.313
I wouldn't touch it.

27:38.574 --> 27:40.405
What are you?

27:43.746 --> 27:45.407
Well....

27:48.584 --> 27:51.496
I'm Sookie Stackhouse...

27:51.671 --> 27:53.753
...and I'm a waitress.

27:57.426 --> 27:59.166
What's your name?

28:02.098 --> 28:03.804
Bill.

28:08.896 --> 28:10.511
Bill?

28:12.358 --> 28:16.692
I thought it might be Antoine or Basil or—-

28:16.863 --> 28:21.948
Or-- Or, like, Langford, maybe. But, Bill?

28:22.118 --> 28:24.734
Vampire Bill.

28:24.912 --> 28:26.618
Oh, my.

28:31.460 --> 28:34.076
So....

28:34.255 --> 28:36.371
Silver, huh?

28:36.549 --> 28:39.541
I thought that only affected werewolves.

28:39.719 --> 28:42.335
I'm not implying that werewolves exist.
I mean...

28:42.513 --> 28:45.255
...that's just what you always see
in the movies.

28:45.433 --> 28:49.301
I'd appreciate it if you didn't share
this information with anyone.

28:50.730 --> 28:54.473
We don't like for our weaknesses
to be made public knowledge.

28:58.654 --> 28:59.985
Yeah.

29:01.282 --> 29:02.442
Okay.

29:07.830 --> 29:09.240
Well....

29:11.250 --> 29:13.036
See you, Bill.

29:13.961 --> 29:15.952
I gotta get back to work.

29:32.605 --> 29:34.015
SooMe.

29:35.149 --> 29:37.014
Thank God.

29:40.780 --> 29:41.860
You okay?

29:42.031 --> 29:45.273
I'm fine. And, for your information...

29:45.451 --> 29:48.693
...not all vampires
can take care of themselves.

30:05.554 --> 30:06.714
-Night, Sam.
-Night.

30:06.889 --> 30:09.050
-Night, Tara.
-Night.

30:12.687 --> 30:15.394
Thanks for helping me out tonight, Tara.

30:15.982 --> 30:17.688
How much you gonna pay me?

30:20.069 --> 30:21.104
Twenty bucks?

30:21.278 --> 30:24.270
Sam. How do you expect me to work here
for 20 bucks a night?

30:24.448 --> 30:25.904
I don't expect you to work here.

30:26.075 --> 30:28.612
You only covered tonight for what,
an hour at the most?

30:28.786 --> 30:31.027
Yeah, but Sam. If I did work here--

30:31.205 --> 30:34.038
It'd be a matter of time
before you went off on somebody.

30:34.208 --> 30:36.073
I don't wanna drive my customers away.

30:36.252 --> 30:37.742
I only go off on stupid people.

30:37.920 --> 30:39.876
Most of my customers are stupid people.

30:40.715 --> 30:42.580
Yeah, but--

30:42.758 --> 30:44.919
I could help you keep an eye on Sookie.

30:45.094 --> 30:47.426
You see the way she
was looking at that vampire?

30:47.596 --> 30:50.133
That is just trouble
looking for a place to happen.

30:50.725 --> 30:54.217
And she means too much to both of us
to let anything happen to her.

30:57.606 --> 30:59.107
All right.

30:59.734 --> 31:01.019
Be here tomorrow at 6.

31:02.570 --> 31:06.108
And learn this on your own.
All right, I don't have time to train you.

31:06.282 --> 31:09.900
Sam, I was mixing whiskey sours
for my mama when I was in first grade.

31:10.077 --> 31:11.613
It's just like riding a bicycle.

31:11.787 --> 31:15.075
-That's fucked up.
-You think?

31:15.249 --> 31:16.659
My mama crazy.

31:16.834 --> 31:18.699
Damn, girl.

31:18.878 --> 31:20.789
Hey, Sam, is my sister here?

31:20.963 --> 31:22.794
No, Sookie already went home.

31:23.466 --> 31:24.751
Hi, Jason.

31:25.301 --> 31:26.461
Hey.

31:27.428 --> 31:30.795
My name is Tara. I've been your sister's
best friend since kindergarten.

31:30.973 --> 31:33.806
I used to sleep over
at your house for, like, years.

31:34.727 --> 31:37.560
-I know who you are.
-You better know who I am.

31:41.108 --> 31:43.144
Well, hello, stranger.

31:45.821 --> 31:47.027
Hey.

31:47.198 --> 31:48.859
Dawn.

31:49.033 --> 31:50.648
Come here.

31:53.162 --> 31:55.073
Look at you. You look great.

31:56.415 --> 31:57.916
-How you been?
-Fine.

31:58.084 --> 31:59.324
Partying.

31:59.502 --> 32:01.663
So you ain't mad at me?

32:02.588 --> 32:03.794
Why would I be mad at you?

32:03.964 --> 32:06.091
Well, for not calling.
You know, the usual.

32:06.258 --> 32:09.750
Jason,baby,
I ain't got no expectations of you.

32:09.929 --> 32:12.011
I'm not an idiot.

32:13.724 --> 32:15.589
Hey, what time do you get off work?

32:15.768 --> 32:17.429
Well, I don't know.

32:17.603 --> 32:19.468
Oh, well, right now.

32:22.191 --> 32:24.102
You wanna go somewhere?

32:24.276 --> 32:26.892
Well, yeah, I do.

32:27.071 --> 32:29.027
I wanna go home.

32:30.533 --> 32:32.694
Good night, Tara.

32:33.494 --> 32:35.030
Oh, my God.

32:35.204 --> 32:38.571
You are a gigantic parody of yourself,
and you don't even know it.

32:38.749 --> 32:40.910
Great seeing you, Tara. Good luck.

32:42.086 --> 32:43.417
Good luck?

32:45.923 --> 32:47.379
Shit.

33:03.149 --> 33:04.810
Hey, Gran.

33:04.984 --> 33:07.726
-Hi, honey.
-Guess what happened tonight?

33:09.238 --> 33:10.728
You got a date.

33:12.741 --> 33:13.821
No.

33:13.993 --> 33:15.699
A vampire came into the bar.

33:17.288 --> 33:19.244
Did he have fangs?

33:19.415 --> 33:21.872
Yeah, but most of the time
they stayed put away.

33:22.042 --> 33:24.078
-Did he bite anybody?
-No.

33:24.253 --> 33:25.709
He just had a glass of wine.

33:25.880 --> 33:28.963
Well, he ordered it, but didn't drink it.

33:29.133 --> 33:31.169
I think he just wanted some company.

33:31.343 --> 33:32.719
Did you like him?

33:34.180 --> 33:37.388
He was real interesting.

33:42.438 --> 33:44.053
I'll let you get to bed.

33:45.733 --> 33:49.851
Okay, honey, ljust stayed up
until you got here.

33:50.029 --> 33:51.439
Come on, Tina.

34:56.345 --> 34:58.006
Hello.

35:02.309 --> 35:07.429
I never thought I would be having sex
with you.

35:08.440 --> 35:09.646
At least. ..

35:11.277 --> 35:13.609
...not so fast.

35:13.779 --> 35:17.363
Who said anything about sex?

35:34.216 --> 35:38.084
Hey. How come you didn't tell me
you beat up the Rattrays last night?

35:38.262 --> 35:39.877
I haven't even seen you since then.

35:40.055 --> 35:42.137
-Where's Gran?
-Hanging the laundry out back.

35:42.308 --> 35:45.675
And you keep your voice down.
I don't want her to know about any of this.

35:45.853 --> 35:49.471
Fortenberry couldn't wait till I got to work
this morning to tell me about it.

35:49.648 --> 35:51.684
Hoyt Fortenberry?
How the heck does he know?

35:51.859 --> 35:54.350
He went over to the Rats
last night to buy some weed.

35:54.528 --> 35:57.691
And Denise drove up like she wanted
to kill somebody she was so mad.

35:57.865 --> 36:02.234
The only way she would sell him any weed
was if he would drive Mack to the hospital.

36:02.411 --> 36:05.494
Well, did Hoyt tell you
that Mack came after me with a knife?

36:05.956 --> 36:07.116
Motherfucker.

36:07.291 --> 36:08.576
You want me to kick his ass?

36:08.751 --> 36:10.742
I already took care of that,
thank you.

36:12.421 --> 36:14.082
What are you doing messing with him?

36:14.256 --> 36:18.875
Did you know that in addition to drugs, the
Rats also happen to be vampire drainers?

36:20.220 --> 36:22.927
Yep. One of my customers
last night was a vampire...

36:23.098 --> 36:26.431
...and they were draining him
in the parking lot. I couldn't have that.

36:26.602 --> 36:29.719
Sookie, you do not want
to get mixed up with vampires.

36:29.897 --> 36:31.603
-Trust me.
-Oh, shut up.

36:31.774 --> 36:33.105
Even if you hate vampires...

36:33.275 --> 36:35.812
...you can't let trash like
the Rats go and drain them.

36:35.986 --> 36:37.897
It's not like siphoning gas out of a car.

36:38.072 --> 36:40.358
-They would have left him to die.
-Who cares?

36:40.532 --> 36:43.615
-He's already dead.
-That's not his fault.

36:47.956 --> 36:49.116
What did he look like?

36:50.751 --> 36:51.957
Handsome...

36:52.127 --> 36:54.083
...in asortof....

36:54.254 --> 36:57.963
Sort of old-fashioned,
like from a movie on TCM.

36:58.133 --> 37:00.795
-Was he bald-headed?
-No. He had really nice hair.

37:00.969 --> 37:03.130
-Tattoos?
-None that I could see.

37:03.972 --> 37:06.304
-Jason.
-Gran.

37:06.475 --> 37:09.763
Sakes alive, boy,
where have you been keeping yourself?

37:09.937 --> 37:12.804
-You get on over here and hug my neck.
-You get here, Gran.

37:13.816 --> 37:15.477
How's my girl?

37:15.651 --> 37:17.357
-You're all sweaty.
-I know.

37:17.528 --> 37:20.816
-You want some iced tea?
-I would love some iced tea.

37:20.989 --> 37:22.490
Here, I got it.

37:26.078 --> 37:28.069
-Want the rest of that?
-Yes.

37:28.247 --> 37:29.783
Thank you.

37:32.835 --> 37:36.419
If you're gonna wear that suit, you might
want to start watching what you eat.

37:38.465 --> 37:40.751
-You look nice.
-Call me later.

37:40.926 --> 37:43.963
That was Everlee Mason.

37:44.138 --> 37:47.630
Guess who was found strangled to death
in her apartment.

37:48.475 --> 37:50.056
Maudette Pickens.

37:50.227 --> 37:52.309
Oh, my Lord.

37:53.355 --> 37:54.856
She didn't show up for work.

37:55.023 --> 37:56.559
She wasn't answering her phone.

37:56.733 --> 37:59.190
And so her boss called Bud Dearborne.

37:59.361 --> 38:02.478
He rode over,
got the manager to let him in...

38:02.656 --> 38:04.647
...and they found her.

38:04.825 --> 38:07.362
I went to high school with Maudette.

38:07.786 --> 38:09.367
Can you believe it?

38:09.538 --> 38:11.028
A murder in Bon Temps.

38:11.206 --> 38:14.164
Well, why are you surprised
now that we got ourselves a vampire?

38:14.334 --> 38:16.711
Because he's a vampire
doesn't mean he's a murderer.

38:16.879 --> 38:20.497
Oh, come on. Fang-bangers go missing
all the time in Shreveport, New Orleans.

38:20.674 --> 38:24.041
They never find them but everybody knows
the vampires are killing them...

38:24.219 --> 38:27.632
-...and then disposing of the bodies.
-What's a fang-banger?

38:27.806 --> 38:29.842
A vampire groupie.

38:30.392 --> 38:33.680
Men and women who like to get bitten.

38:33.854 --> 38:37.767
-My stars.
-Maudette was a fang-banger?

38:38.317 --> 38:40.308
How do you know that?

38:41.403 --> 38:42.768
I don't know, Sookie.

38:42.946 --> 38:46.063
The way
that you just know things sometimes.

38:57.377 --> 39:01.416
There's also hookers
who specialize in vampires.

39:01.590 --> 39:03.706
They drink Tru Blood
to keep their supply up...

39:03.884 --> 39:08.753
...and they keep a bodyguard there
in case the vamp gets a little too frisky.

39:12.476 --> 39:13.761
I read that in a magazine.

39:14.978 --> 39:18.345
I wonder how much one would charge
for something like that.

39:18.524 --> 39:19.604
A thousand bucks.

39:20.192 --> 39:22.774
See, now thatjust makes me sick.

39:22.945 --> 39:24.230
I know.

39:24.404 --> 39:27.271
What kind of cheap woman
could ever do something like that?

39:27.449 --> 39:30.236
No, it makes me sick that
they're getting a thousand bucks...

39:30.410 --> 39:34.198
...to lay there and do nothing while I
bust my ass for 10 bucks an hour plus tips.

39:34.373 --> 39:36.910
Oh, I don't think they just lay there.

39:37.084 --> 39:41.373
I think they're expected to,
you know, participate.

39:52.808 --> 39:55.220
Well, thanks for lunch, Gran.

39:58.855 --> 40:00.311
What?

40:00.941 --> 40:01.976
What?

40:02.150 --> 40:05.483
This can't be happening to me.
How could I lose control? How come--?

40:05.654 --> 40:09.238
Don't try that with me, goddamn it.
I'm your brother.

40:11.034 --> 40:12.490
Back to work.

40:25.132 --> 40:26.668
Please?

40:26.842 --> 40:28.127
Hurry up now.

40:28.302 --> 40:31.009
Come on, Dawn,
I'm having a really bad day.

40:31.179 --> 40:33.386
That is not my responsibility.

40:33.557 --> 40:34.842
Didn't we have a good time?

40:35.017 --> 40:36.848
And don't you want to have that again?

40:37.019 --> 40:40.853
Look, I'm sorry to break it to you, but you
are not my only source for a good time.

40:41.023 --> 40:43.685
No, but I am the best one.

40:44.109 --> 40:46.816
Oh, my God, you're so full of shit.

40:46.987 --> 40:49.194
-But I’m hot.
-So am I.

40:49.615 --> 40:51.526
Yeah, I know, I know.

40:54.536 --> 40:56.367
That's why
I'm on the phone with you.

40:57.080 --> 40:58.695
Oh, all right, I give up.

40:58.874 --> 41:00.785
You can meet me after work.

41:00.959 --> 41:02.870
I gotta go. I'll call you back.

41:12.220 --> 41:13.346
Hey.

41:13.513 --> 41:15.970
Sheriff Dearborne. Andy.

41:16.141 --> 41:18.223
Afternoon, Jason.

41:23.899 --> 41:27.062
-Is there something I can help you with?
-You know Maudette Pickens?

41:27.235 --> 41:30.853
I know her. I buy stuff at the GrabbitKwik.
She works there during the day.

41:31.031 --> 41:34.194
How would you characterize
your relationship with Maudette?

41:34.368 --> 41:37.030
Relationship?
I didn't have a relationship with her.

41:37.204 --> 41:38.569
I barely even knew her.

41:38.747 --> 41:41.159
So you're aware
she was murdered last night?

41:42.834 --> 41:44.244
No.

41:46.004 --> 41:47.915
I mean, yeah. Yeah. I did know that.

41:48.090 --> 41:50.206
My grandmother told me at lunch.

41:50.384 --> 41:52.249
Somebody called her.

41:52.427 --> 41:54.634
What's up with Jason and the law?

41:55.972 --> 41:58.884
Maybe they think he knows something
about Maudette.

41:59.059 --> 42:01.175
You ever visit Maudette
at her apartment?

42:01.770 --> 42:03.260
Me? No.

42:03.730 --> 42:06.517
-Ever?
-No.

42:06.692 --> 42:09.729
Boys, I could do a lot better
than Maudette Pickens, believe me.

42:12.114 --> 42:13.570
You weren't there last night?

42:15.283 --> 42:17.660
Last night....

42:17.828 --> 42:19.864
Okay, yeah, I was there last night.

42:20.038 --> 42:21.903
Hey. Then why didn't you say so?

42:22.082 --> 42:24.744
-What?
-Then why didn't you say so?

42:24.918 --> 42:26.874
Because I know she got killed.

42:27.045 --> 42:29.787
And I thought it would look bad
me having been to her place.

42:29.965 --> 42:31.796
Well, it does look bad, Jason.

42:31.967 --> 42:33.798
It looks real bad.

42:33.969 --> 42:35.709
Okay, look.

42:39.391 --> 42:41.598
That's all.

42:41.768 --> 42:44.475
How would you characterize the sex?

42:46.690 --> 42:49.306
-It was okay.
-Nothing out of the ordinary?

42:50.986 --> 42:52.942
Well....

42:53.113 --> 42:55.149
Because we've already seen
the videotape.

43:02.497 --> 43:04.158
You didn't know she was taping it?

43:04.791 --> 43:06.167
No.

43:07.210 --> 43:08.996
But I should have.

43:09.171 --> 43:11.628
You need to come with us, Jason.

43:13.341 --> 43:16.208
Just let me tell Rene to take over.

43:16.386 --> 43:17.796
I'll be right back.

43:19.514 --> 43:21.345
I hate that little shit.

43:24.519 --> 43:26.896
-Go, go, go.
-Hey, Rene.

43:27.063 --> 43:29.805
I gotta go into town for a while.
You'll take over?

43:30.484 --> 43:32.645
Yeah, yeah. Everything all right?

43:32.819 --> 43:36.186
Yeah. No, it's nothing to worry about.
Everything's fine.

43:37.908 --> 43:40.149
Don't tell my sister. Okay?

43:42.829 --> 43:44.820
Hey, what'd you do, Jason?

43:45.665 --> 43:47.041
Let's go.

43:47.209 --> 43:49.575
Let's go. Move.

43:50.796 --> 43:51.831
Get up.

43:52.005 --> 43:53.541
What the fuck, huh?

43:55.217 --> 43:56.707
Let's go.

44:02.849 --> 44:04.714
What's up, Gran?

44:07.395 --> 44:12.264
I was just wondering how old you think
the vampire is. The one you met last night.

44:12.442 --> 44:15.400
I have no idea. Why?

44:16.029 --> 44:18.816
You think he might remember the war?

44:20.742 --> 44:22.733
The Civil War?

44:25.622 --> 44:26.737
Could be.

44:28.375 --> 44:31.492
If he does,
I would love to have him come speak...

44:31.670 --> 44:34.412
...to the Descendants
of the Glorious Dead.

44:34.589 --> 44:36.580
You think he might want to?

44:36.758 --> 44:39.966
I think he might have a hard time
showing up at the public library...

44:40.136 --> 44:41.421
...at noon on a Thursday.

44:43.765 --> 44:46.427
We could have a special meeting
at night...

44:46.601 --> 44:50.093
...or he could just come talk to me
and I could tape his recollections.

44:50.605 --> 44:55.224
Oh, I am sure the other members
would find it so interesting.

44:55.402 --> 44:58.769
I'll ask him next time he comes in
to Merlotte's.

44:58.947 --> 45:01.188
If he comes in.

45:01.366 --> 45:03.573
Do you want me to wait outside?

45:05.287 --> 45:06.447
For all the beans.

45:06.955 --> 45:08.070
-Yeah, boy.
-Oh, baby.

45:08.248 --> 45:09.328
Oh, baby.

45:09.499 --> 45:12.457
-You can do better than that.
-Oh, baby.

45:15.005 --> 45:16.870
Hey.

45:24.472 --> 45:26.428
Hey.

45:27.309 --> 45:30.267
Hooker. How you doing?
What you doing here?

45:30.437 --> 45:32.803
-| work here.
-Oh, no, the hell you don't.

45:32.981 --> 45:36.724
Oh, yes, the hell I do too, you ugly bitch.
You need to make peace with that.

45:36.902 --> 45:39.985
Shit. Sam must have lost
his damn mind...

45:40.155 --> 45:43.318
...because you should not be allowed
to work in no situation...

45:43.491 --> 45:46.324
...where you actually gotta interact
with people.

45:46.494 --> 45:48.155
That is so not true.

45:48.330 --> 45:50.491
Do not snap at me.

45:50.665 --> 45:54.123
I have a name. And that name is Tara.

45:54.294 --> 45:55.579
And isn't that funny?

45:55.754 --> 45:59.997
Black girl being named after a plantation.
No, I don't think it's funny at all.

46:00.175 --> 46:05.135
In fact, it really pisses me off that my mama
was either stupid orjust plain mean...

46:05.305 --> 46:09.264
...which is why you better be nice
if you plan on getting a drink tonight.

46:09.434 --> 46:11.470
Sorry, ma'am.

46:11.645 --> 46:13.181
Okay.

46:13.688 --> 46:15.599
Hey.

46:15.774 --> 46:19.687
Do you know if Sookie found out about
her brother getting arrested this afternoon?

46:19.861 --> 46:21.897
Jason got arrested? For what?

46:22.072 --> 46:26.236
I ain't sure, but Maudette Pickens
did get found murdered.

46:26.409 --> 46:27.865
Are you serious?

46:28.036 --> 46:29.651
Jason couldn't kill anybody.

46:29.829 --> 46:32.536
And he can do a hell of a lot
better than Maudette Pickens.

46:32.707 --> 46:35.540
-Look at you. You still got a thing for him.
-I do not.

46:35.710 --> 46:39.999
-That boy is too damn stuck-up for me.
-That boy is sex on a stick.

46:40.173 --> 46:42.414
I don't give a good damn
how stuck-up he is.

46:42.592 --> 46:43.877
How you doing?

46:44.052 --> 46:46.668
Look at you. Scaring that white boy.

46:46.846 --> 46:48.632
Ain't nobody scaring him.

46:48.807 --> 46:51.344
He too big to be scared.
I likes a big man.

46:51.518 --> 46:53.179
Look at that belly.

46:53.353 --> 46:55.309
Don't you have something to fry?

46:55.480 --> 46:57.721
You can be my Santa Claus.

47:00.735 --> 47:02.441
I'll see you later.

47:02.612 --> 47:04.227
I'm in the phone book.

47:04.406 --> 47:06.943
-Arrested? For what?
-I don't know.

47:07.117 --> 47:10.405
Sook. Sorry about your brother.

47:10.578 --> 47:13.115
How come everybody knew about this
before I did?

47:13.289 --> 47:15.871
Well, I was there, baby girl.
I saw him get carted away.

47:16.042 --> 47:18.749
I was complaining to Arlene
about Jason hanging up on me...

47:18.920 --> 47:21.582
...when we were making a date,
and that's when she told me.

47:21.756 --> 47:25.340
-Arlene? How does she know?
-Well, I guess Rene told her.

47:25.510 --> 47:27.922
Besides, we figured you'd just--

47:31.516 --> 47:33.177
I just what?

47:34.686 --> 47:37.723
Sweetie, didn't you just know already?

47:38.648 --> 47:41.560
I am not psychic.

47:44.988 --> 47:47.604
Damn, you suck, Rene.

47:48.283 --> 47:49.398
Quiet you.

47:49.576 --> 47:52.568
I cannot believe I am here
on my night off.

47:52.746 --> 47:57.786
Just pouring my hard-earned money
back into Sam Merlotte's pocket.

47:58.877 --> 48:00.583
What happened to my brother,
Rene?

48:02.464 --> 48:04.921
Hell, I promised him
I wasn't gonna tell you.

48:05.091 --> 48:06.706
What happened?

48:07.594 --> 48:09.130
Well....

48:09.304 --> 48:12.637
Bud Dearborne and Andy Bellefleur...

48:12.807 --> 48:14.422
...they asked him some questions...

48:14.601 --> 48:17.388
...and then theyjust threw him
in the back of the squad car.

48:17.562 --> 48:20.053
You don't even know for a fact
that they arrested him?

48:20.231 --> 48:22.313
Well, they--
They didn't cuff him or nothing.

48:22.484 --> 48:25.476
Sookie, I am so sorry.

48:25.653 --> 48:28.690
For what? Y'all are already acting
like Jason's been convicted...

48:28.865 --> 48:32.904
...of killing Maudette and we don't even
know what they were talking to him about.

48:35.330 --> 48:39.619
Yeah. It has to be,
because Jason's a real standup guy.

48:40.126 --> 48:41.582
No, he's not, Hoyt.

48:41.753 --> 48:44.165
He is selfish, egotistical,
and a complete horndog...

48:44.339 --> 48:46.125
...but he is not a killer.

49:08.696 --> 49:13.486
Just look at that, like she's walking
down the aisle on her wedding day.

49:13.660 --> 49:15.025
Honey, just because a guy....

49:15.203 --> 49:16.989
It's that vampire.

49:20.917 --> 49:24.205
He '3 got her in his sights.
I need to protect her.

49:24.379 --> 49:27.041
That's that vampire she saved last night.

49:27.215 --> 49:29.001
Sookie, please do not--

49:29.092 --> 49:31.378
Good evening, Miss Stackhouse.

49:31.553 --> 49:34.636
It ain't right, him being
here with normal people.

49:34.806 --> 49:36.216
No, she's gonna sit--

49:39.185 --> 49:42.928
I always thought she was nice, but I just
wonder what kind of a Christian girl...

49:43.106 --> 49:44.391
...would look at a vampire--

49:44.566 --> 49:46.648
I don’t think he looks that kind of scary.

49:46.818 --> 49:50.231
-Looks like she likes them tall and dead.
-Why isn't he talking to me?

49:50.405 --> 49:53.738
Stackhouse family ain't nothing
but trash.

50:14.554 --> 50:16.385
Your hand is cool.

50:17.432 --> 50:19.047
Yes.

50:19.934 --> 50:23.097
I'm afraid I'm not as warm as the men
that you must be accustomed to.

50:23.271 --> 50:24.511
What men?

50:35.491 --> 50:37.618
What can I get for you tonight?

50:40.371 --> 50:42.362
What are you?

50:43.791 --> 50:46.749
I told you. I'm a waitress.

50:47.503 --> 50:48.913
No.

50:49.797 --> 50:52.630
You're something more than that.

50:53.801 --> 50:55.632
You're something more than human.

50:55.803 --> 50:58.135
I beg your pardon?

51:01.059 --> 51:02.890
SooMe.

51:05.230 --> 51:07.095
That's an unusual name, Sookie.

51:09.192 --> 51:10.807
Is it short for something else?

51:12.820 --> 51:13.809
Nope.

51:13.988 --> 51:16.821
Just-- Just plain Sookie.

51:19.577 --> 51:21.818
May I call on you sometime?

51:23.539 --> 51:25.825
Call on me?

51:29.003 --> 51:31.619
May I come and visit with you
at your home?

51:32.465 --> 51:34.001
Sure.

51:34.717 --> 51:36.582
My grandmother would love to meet you.

51:38.388 --> 51:41.630
Oh, that reminds me.
Can I talk to you after work?

51:41.808 --> 51:43.469
I have a favor to ask you.

51:45.103 --> 51:47.936
Of course. After all, I am in your debt.

51:48.106 --> 51:49.767
Not a favor for me.

51:49.941 --> 51:54.526
For my grandmother. If you'll be up--
Well--

51:55.488 --> 51:56.694
I guess you will be.

51:56.864 --> 52:00.197
Would you mind meeting me around
the back of the bar when I get off at—-

52:00.368 --> 52:02.609
Probably around 1:30?

52:04.956 --> 52:06.992
I'd be delighted.

52:13.006 --> 52:16.373
Do you realize that every person
in this establishment...

52:16.551 --> 52:19.088
...is staring at us right now?

52:26.811 --> 52:30.019
Oh, they're just staring at me,
because my brother's...

52:30.189 --> 52:32.896
...in some kind of trouble with the police.

52:35.737 --> 52:38.353
But, Bill, did you know
Maudette Pickens?

52:38.531 --> 52:40.487
I did not.

52:41.075 --> 52:45.034
They are staring at us
because I am a vampire.

52:46.247 --> 52:48.078
And you...

52:50.251 --> 52:51.957
...are mortal.

52:54.922 --> 52:57.584
Well, who cares what they think?

52:59.177 --> 53:02.544
Well, I wanna make this town my home,
so...

53:04.265 --> 53:06.221
...I do.

53:10.772 --> 53:12.763
I'll see you at 1:30.

53:18.946 --> 53:20.902
Run away as fast
as your legs can take you.

53:21.074 --> 53:24.362
-I thought she was--
-This is wrong. It's wrong.

53:24.535 --> 53:28.278
I shouldn't be feeling like this.
I just wanna watch them do it. Damn.

53:28.456 --> 53:32.574
He hypnotized her. I heard they can do that
just by looking at you.

53:33.795 --> 53:35.626
I'm telling Reverend--

53:41.135 --> 53:42.966
Sookie, you're being a very stupid girl.

53:43.137 --> 53:45.128
Who asked you?
I can take care of myself.

53:45.306 --> 53:47.467
I don't think so.
Mack could have cut you up.

53:47.642 --> 53:50.509
-How do you know?
-Now you're setting a date with a vampire?

53:50.686 --> 53:52.813
-What do you have, a death wish?
-No, I don't.

53:52.980 --> 53:56.472
I happen to thinkjudging an entire
group of people based on the actions...

53:56.651 --> 53:59.484
...of a few individuals within that group
is morally wrong.

53:59.654 --> 54:03.146
Well, I will not let you put yourself
or this bar in danger. I won't.

54:06.953 --> 54:08.318
Am I fired?

54:09.664 --> 54:13.122
No. But next time you think somebody's
being harmed in the parking lot...

54:13.292 --> 54:15.328
...pick up the phone and call the police.

54:15.503 --> 54:18.916
Do not go out there alone
like a goddamn vigilante!

54:25.263 --> 54:26.799
Oh, chere.

54:27.515 --> 54:28.800
Hey.

54:28.975 --> 54:30.931
Hey, hey.

54:33.646 --> 54:35.182
Don't you know I couldn't lose you?

54:35.314 --> 54:38.852
Feels so warm, I can't help it.
I want you. Damn. you smell so good.

54:39.026 --> 54:40.357
I love the way you smell.

54:40.528 --> 54:42.860
[love you, and I always have.
I want to tell you--

54:43.030 --> 54:45.191
Sookie, are you out
of your ever-loving mind?

54:45.366 --> 54:48.824
That vampire wants you for dinner.
I won't let you just walk into his trap.

54:48.995 --> 54:51.111
No, over my dead body.
You mean too much to me.

54:51.289 --> 54:53.871
Don’t look at me like that
when I'm looking out for you.

54:54.041 --> 54:56.703
I never noticed how much you and Jason
have the same eyes.

54:56.878 --> 54:58.709
Sweet eyes. He could never kill anybody.

54:58.838 --> 55:00.374
Oh, for heaven's sakes, Tara.

55:00.548 --> 55:03.210
Jason is never gonna care about you
the way you care.

55:03.384 --> 55:05.090
What the fuck--?

55:05.261 --> 55:07.377
You made a promise.
You stay out of my head.

55:07.555 --> 55:10.217
-You promised me.
-I know how hard for her it’s gotta be.

55:10.391 --> 55:13.053
Maybe Jason will get shook up
by this whole Maudette--

55:13.227 --> 55:13.977
I understand--

Just shut up, both of you,
and stop bossing me around!

55:17.064 --> 55:18.804
I am a grown woman and I am the one...

55:18.983 --> 55:21.941
...who decides what I do,
not either one of you.

56:00.024 --> 56:01.104
SooMe.

56:02.193 --> 56:03.558
Sam.

56:05.613 --> 56:08.901
-You want me to wait with you until--?
-Go home, Sam.

56:10.952 --> 56:12.408
Good night.
