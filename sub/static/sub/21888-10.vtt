00:06.006 --> 00:11.053
My staying in Israel has nothing
to do with you, okay?

00:11.095 --> 00:14.932
It's, it's...
This is about

00:14.974 --> 00:18.686
something that's happening here,
for me.

00:18.728 --> 00:21.814
And I need to do something.

00:21.856 --> 00:24.108
What else do you need to do?
You went to the wall.

00:24.150 --> 00:26.026
I'm not finished.

00:26.068 --> 00:27.236
Please.

00:27.278 --> 00:29.655
There have been moments here

00:29.697 --> 00:33.993
where I have felt more
like myself than I ever have.

00:34.034 --> 00:36.829
And I need to feel more of that.

00:36.871 --> 00:39.707
I'm gonna go back to the farm
where my friends are

00:39.749 --> 00:41.208
and I'll figure it out
from there.

00:47.131 --> 00:48.966
You do what you have to do.

00:50.259 --> 00:52.470
-ALI: Thank you.
-SHELLY: Well, I hope

00:52.511 --> 00:54.472
you're not going to come back
observing Ramadan.

00:54.513 --> 00:55.598
-SARAH: Let us-- let's go.
-MAURA: Oh, my God.

00:55.639 --> 00:56.932
-No.
-We'll just say our good-byes.

00:56.974 --> 00:58.142
I love you.

00:58.184 --> 00:59.268
Love you.

00:59.310 --> 01:00.686
Don't stay forever.

01:00.728 --> 01:02.605
Do not stay or I'll kill you.

Bye, Ali.

Bye.

01:07.359 --> 01:09.570
-(grunts)
-It's gonna be okay.

01:09.612 --> 01:11.238
I love you.

01:11.280 --> 01:12.573
I love you, too.

01:12.615 --> 01:14.575
This has been the most
incredible thing

01:14.617 --> 01:16.118
I ever witnessed.

01:16.160 --> 01:17.536
You think maybe
we could keep in touch?

01:17.578 --> 01:19.205
Call each other on holidays?

01:19.246 --> 01:22.041
Yes, maybe.

01:22.082 --> 01:24.877
Or we could, we could just
catch up in another 70 years.

01:24.919 --> 01:26.921
(laughs)

01:28.923 --> 01:30.591
Thank you, kiddo.

01:45.105 --> 01:46.774
-You'll be okay?
-Yeah.

01:46.816 --> 01:49.652
Are you gonna be okay?

01:49.693 --> 01:51.070
Yeah.

01:51.111 --> 01:52.488
Be careful.

01:52.530 --> 01:53.823
I will.

01:53.864 --> 01:55.241
Don't forget to shower, okay?

01:56.575 --> 01:57.785
-Fuck you.

01:59.036 --> 02:00.746
-Love you.
-I love you.

All right, let's go.

02:02.206 --> 02:03.958
Pfeffermans, come on,
let's do this.

02:03.999 --> 02:05.376

-LEN: Thank you so much.

Come on, come on, come on.

02:07.711 --> 02:09.171

-Feel better?

-Yes.

06:46.824 --> 06:48.158
Yes.

06:48.200 --> 06:50.077
Are you gonna be committed
to do the work?

06:50.119 --> 06:52.454
Follow the steps,
take it seriously.

06:52.496 --> 06:53.831
Yeah, yeah.

06:53.872 --> 06:56.375
-If you're down...
-I'm down.

06:56.416 --> 07:00.212
...I'm down,
and I got your back, all right?

07:03.340 --> 07:04.716
Okay.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.218

11:00.535 --> 11:04.247
Thank you.
Oh, my God, I said two salads.

11:04.289 --> 11:06.083
This is enough for a village.

11:06.124 --> 11:08.168
I tend to over-order
when I'm excited to see someone.

11:08.210 --> 11:09.461
MAURA:
Goodness.

11:09.503 --> 11:11.546
Oh, I told you about
Davina, right?

11:11.588 --> 11:13.632
-Of course.
-Sorry. (chuckles) -Oh.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.300
-Pleasure.
-Nice to meet you.

11:15.342 --> 11:17.094

-MAURA: You hungry?

11:17.135 --> 11:18.178
I'm starving.

11:18.220 --> 11:19.805
Good, have a seat.

11:21.181 --> 11:22.224
-MAURA: Yeah?
-DAVINA: Uh-huh.

11:22.265 --> 11:23.517
MAURA:
Uh-huh.

11:23.558 --> 11:25.602
-Mmm.
-MAURA: Well, we have made

11:25.644 --> 11:27.396
a frightening dent in this food.

11:27.437 --> 11:29.272
-DAVINA: This is really good.
-It is good.

11:29.314 --> 11:32.025
This salad--
I used to hate ranch dressing

11:32.067 --> 11:34.694
when I was little, and now
I'm noticing I really love it.

11:34.736 --> 11:36.363
-It's weird, isn't it?
-Yeah.

11:36.405 --> 11:40.617
Well, I used to have a phrase
I'd say all the time--

11:40.659 --> 11:43.245
life's a roller coaster.

11:43.286 --> 11:44.746
Hmm.

11:44.788 --> 11:46.790
I love that.

11:49.918 --> 11:52.170
(door opens)

11:52.212 --> 11:54.005
MAURA:
Uh-oh.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.382
-Okay.
-Who's that?

11:55.424 --> 11:58.343
MAURA:
Hi. So you must be my

11:58.385 --> 12:00.178
Internet tenant?

12:00.220 --> 12:02.472
-AUGUST: Christ on a cracker.
-You okay? -Yeah.

12:02.514 --> 12:04.975
What are you people doing here?

12:05.016 --> 12:08.061
Hi, I'm Maura.
I'm your landlady, and, um...

12:08.103 --> 12:10.147
-Hey, I'm Donald.
-AUGUST: You people need

12:10.188 --> 12:11.398
to get the hell out of here.

12:11.440 --> 12:14.776
I'm sorry to say this,
but, uh...

12:14.818 --> 12:16.611
uh, circumstances have changed.

12:16.653 --> 12:18.530
Un-fucking-believable.

12:18.572 --> 12:20.782
Well, I will have you know
that I will be writing

12:20.824 --> 12:23.410
a particularly atrocious,
scathing review

12:23.452 --> 12:24.870
-to Airbnb, all right?
-Okay.

12:24.911 --> 12:26.371
AUGUST:
I mean, from the very beginning,

12:26.413 --> 12:28.415
you've been nothing
but a pain in my ass.

12:28.457 --> 12:30.167
MAURA:
Wow.

12:30.208 --> 12:34.337
Okay, um, I'm-I'm-I'm of course
willing to reimburse you.

12:34.379 --> 12:36.339
I've already paid $1,800,

12:36.381 --> 12:37.674
-all right, for the
upcoming week. -All right.

12:37.716 --> 12:39.426
Okay, that's just, um...

12:39.468 --> 12:41.511
Actually, that's an enormous
sum of money.

12:41.553 --> 12:42.888
But let me, um...

12:42.929 --> 12:45.182
let me reimburse you
and show you out.

12:45.223 --> 12:46.892
It doesn't make any difference.

12:46.933 --> 12:48.393
I will not be evacuated.

12:48.435 --> 12:50.395
I cannot be evicted!

12:50.437 --> 12:51.730
I have business here.

12:51.771 --> 12:55.108
I don't have the time
to go hunting

12:55.150 --> 12:56.485
for another dwelling!

12:56.526 --> 12:57.819
Your dwell-hunt is
of no concern to me.

12:57.861 --> 12:59.571
Get out. Let's go.

12:59.613 --> 13:02.491
I'm entitled to what
I motherfucking paid for!

13:02.532 --> 13:05.243
-Hey, hey, rei... rein it in,
fella. -MAURA: Oh, my God!

13:05.285 --> 13:06.870
Oh, oh, you want me
to rein it in?

13:06.912 --> 13:09.331
Okay, I'm gonna rein it in
right now, okay?

13:09.372 --> 13:11.625
Passive resistance, all right?

13:11.666 --> 13:12.792
Little conscientious
subjectification.

13:12.834 --> 13:14.836
-Oh, my God.
-What?

13:14.878 --> 13:17.172
-Oh, my God!
-(August chuckles)

13:17.214 --> 13:18.507
-DAVINA: What is he doing?
-MAURA: He is...

13:18.548 --> 13:21.468
He is, um...
He has planked.

13:21.510 --> 13:23.011
Oh, my God.

13:24.262 --> 13:25.263
Okay.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.601
LILA:
You got something for me?

13:29.643 --> 13:31.353
-Not a big deal. No big deal.
-Oh.

13:31.394 --> 13:32.771
Got some weight to it.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.231
-This is absolutely...
-Oh, my goodness.

13:34.272 --> 13:35.232
...not a big deal.

13:35.273 --> 13:38.902
-Wow.
-Do you like it?

13:38.944 --> 13:41.112
Yes. Oh, that's beautiful.

13:41.154 --> 13:42.739
-So nice.
-Yeah.

13:42.781 --> 13:44.115
-Thank you.
-'Cause of Israel.

13:44.157 --> 13:45.492
Wow, where'd you get it?

13:45.534 --> 13:46.785
-In Jerusalem.
-In Tel Aviv.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.453
-Or in Tel Aviv.
-In Te-- Jerus...

13:48.495 --> 13:50.455
-Yeah?
-I mean, one of those shops.

13:50.497 --> 13:51.790
I mixed it up.
Anyway.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.625
-Thank you.
-Um, actually,

13:53.667 --> 13:54.960
we wanted to talk to you
about something.

13:55.001 --> 13:56.461
Oh, goodie, yeah. Me, too.

13:56.503 --> 13:57.837
(Sarah chuckles)

13:57.879 --> 13:59.464
Wait, you want to talk to us?

13:59.506 --> 14:01.216
-Yeah, I do.
-Oh. Well, go.

14:01.258 --> 14:02.592
-Yeah, you go.
-You go first. -Okay.

14:02.634 --> 14:04.594
Um, it's a little delicate.

14:04.636 --> 14:08.473
Uh, just 'cause I care
about you guys a lot.

14:08.515 --> 14:13.311
But I kind of met a new partner
while you guys were gone,

14:13.353 --> 14:15.272
and I think
I'm really falling for her.

14:17.315 --> 14:19.276
Wow, that was so fast.

14:19.317 --> 14:21.361
-That was a little fast, yeah.
-Yeah,

14:21.403 --> 14:23.446
but her and I have known
each other for, like, years,

14:23.488 --> 14:26.575
then she just tagged me
in this Instagram, like,

14:26.616 --> 14:28.535
inspiration quote.

14:28.577 --> 14:31.079
You know, "Don't stay inside
when it's raining," like,

14:31.121 --> 14:32.664
"dance in the rain."

14:32.706 --> 14:35.917
But, uh, we got drinks,
you know, met up,

14:35.959 --> 14:38.086
and it was kind of crazy,
the spiritual connection

14:38.128 --> 14:39.504
-we had. -Nice.
-Yeah, that is nice.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.381
-I hope you guys understand.
Yeah? -Oh, we...

14:41.423 --> 14:43.174
-Do not apologize.
-We actually had the same...

14:43.216 --> 14:45.093
-We were gonna say...
-It's weird, it's like...

14:45.135 --> 14:47.304
-All right.
-Can I...? So to be clear, then,

14:47.345 --> 14:49.639
-Mm-hmm.
-about this.

14:49.681 --> 14:52.350
Uh, then, from now on...

14:52.392 --> 14:53.602
-Well...
-We...

14:53.643 --> 14:55.270
We can still work
on Kids on Top.

14:55.312 --> 14:56.855
-Good.
-You know?

14:56.896 --> 14:58.481
And, like, spend time together,
it's just that...

14:58.523 --> 15:03.236
yeah, Becca's now
my primary partner.

15:03.278 --> 15:04.362
Right, right, right.
He's my primary, too.

15:04.404 --> 15:05.405
-Exactly.
-Yeah, yeah.

15:05.447 --> 15:06.823
We know what that is.

15:06.865 --> 15:09.659
Oh, you guys are the best.

15:09.701 --> 15:10.827
-You guys are so cute.
-All right, well,

15:10.869 --> 15:11.953
-guess this is good-bye.
-Yeah.

15:11.995 --> 15:13.079
Thank you for understanding.

15:13.121 --> 15:14.247
We're gonna miss you.

15:14.289 --> 15:15.332
We'll get together.

15:15.373 --> 15:16.416
We'll start writing soon.

15:16.458 --> 15:18.335
Yeah, right?

15:18.376 --> 15:20.337
-Hope so.
-Yeah.

15:20.378 --> 15:21.755
We had fun. Right?

15:21.796 --> 15:22.964
It was so much fun.

15:23.006 --> 15:25.634
This is
the least awkward breakup.

15:25.675 --> 15:29.346
Totally. I mean,
we're great at breakups, right?

15:34.309 --> 15:35.518
(inhales)

15:40.315 --> 15:42.359
LEN:
Goddamn it.

15:42.400 --> 15:44.819
(laughter)

15:44.861 --> 15:47.572
-DAVINA: Oh, my God. -DONALD:
Well, what do we do now?

15:47.614 --> 15:49.324
I don't know, I have no idea.

15:49.366 --> 15:51.117
-I don't...
-Oh, hi.

15:51.159 --> 15:52.369
-MAURA: Come on, see this one.
-Josh said you needed help.

15:52.410 --> 15:53.578
-Oh, my God.
-Go ahead, go ahead.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.163
-What happened?
-DAVINA: He's not hurt

15:55.205 --> 15:56.998
or anything,
he's just doing some kind of

15:57.040 --> 15:59.626
-cis white male sit-in thing.
-MAURA: It's sort of like

15:59.668 --> 16:02.379
a privileged dis...
civil disobedience.

16:02.420 --> 16:03.963
-What's a cis male?
-And who the hell are you?

16:04.005 --> 16:06.758
-A-Are you this schlemiel's
attorney? -MAURA: Oh, I'm sorry.

16:06.800 --> 16:08.760
No, I'm sorry, this is--
my manners--

16:08.802 --> 16:11.471
this is, uh, the... Donald.

16:11.513 --> 16:13.682
-Donald.
-Donald. Oh.

16:13.723 --> 16:15.934
Donald.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.310
Oh, w-- hello. Shelly.

16:17.352 --> 16:19.354
-Shelly. Good to meet you.
-JOSH: All right, I'm sorry.

16:19.396 --> 16:21.106
I'm confused.
I'm Josh Pfefferman.

16:21.147 --> 16:24.484
Oh, Josh. Donald.
I've heard a lot about you.

16:24.526 --> 16:26.403
Fr... From who?

16:26.444 --> 16:27.570
MAURA:
Oh, from, uh, well--

16:27.612 --> 16:29.239
it's actually "from whom?"--

16:29.280 --> 16:30.907
but, uh, this is from me,

16:30.949 --> 16:32.951
and, uh, Donald and I--
do you mind?

16:32.992 --> 16:35.120
-No. Please.
-Donald and I are...

16:35.161 --> 16:36.538
we're dating.

16:36.579 --> 16:38.748
Oh.

16:38.790 --> 16:40.333
Oh. Okay.

16:40.375 --> 16:42.794
I-Interesting.

16:42.836 --> 16:43.795
-Okay.
-You're okay?

16:43.837 --> 16:46.089
That's-- no, it's very cool.

16:46.131 --> 16:48.383
-Uh... -I'm not
that interesting. -You are.

16:48.425 --> 16:50.468
Well, but you're
very good looking, Donald.

16:50.510 --> 16:52.971
-Yeah, isn't he?
-Yes, you are.

16:53.012 --> 16:54.639
-You are.
-Thank you.

16:56.474 --> 16:57.892
So, back to this. What?

16:57.934 --> 16:59.686
MAURA:
Okay, here's the situation.

16:59.728 --> 17:03.231
-This gentleman refuses
to leave. -Sir, excuse me?

17:03.273 --> 17:05.442
-Can I get your attention for a
second? -I'm not going anywhere.

17:05.483 --> 17:08.027
This is my rented sanctuary
for seven days.

17:08.069 --> 17:09.320
Mine.

17:09.362 --> 17:10.572
-Hey, can I tell you something?
-Hey.

17:10.613 --> 17:12.323
-This is my house.
-JOSH: All right.

17:12.365 --> 17:13.867
This is my house.

17:13.908 --> 17:16.369
I raised my kids here.

17:16.411 --> 17:18.246
And I want you to leave.

17:18.288 --> 17:20.540
-I refuse.
-JOSH: Okay.

17:20.582 --> 17:21.708
All right, you're asking for it,
motherfucker.

17:21.750 --> 17:23.001
-No, no, no, no, no.
-Oh, no.

17:23.042 --> 17:24.669
Joshy, don't, don't do that.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.296
-No, no, no, Joshy, don't,
no, no. -Here we go. -No.

17:26.337 --> 17:28.715
That opens us up to a lawsuit.
Please put it down.

17:28.757 --> 17:30.008
-Okay, everybody back.
-Put it down. -All right,

17:30.049 --> 17:31.301
-this-this is fucking
ridiculous! -No.

17:31.342 --> 17:32.719
-SHELLY: No, no, no, everybody,
stop. -Josh, Josh, Josh.

17:32.761 --> 17:33.887
Just give, just give me a sec.

17:33.928 --> 17:36.639
Get back, everybody, back up.

17:36.681 --> 17:38.016
Hey.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.017
(chuckles)

17:39.058 --> 17:40.310
Hey, paisan.

17:40.351 --> 17:41.853
My friend.

17:42.896 --> 17:45.273
Hey, how we gonna respect you

17:45.315 --> 17:48.276
if you don't respect
yourself, huh?

17:51.070 --> 17:53.281
You want to get dragged
out of here?

17:53.323 --> 17:54.616
I mean, of course not.

17:54.657 --> 17:57.869
You want to leave
on your own terms.

17:57.911 --> 18:01.831
You want to stand up
and leave in your own boots.

18:01.873 --> 18:04.209
You're stronger than you think.

18:04.250 --> 18:07.337
Locate your dignity.

18:07.378 --> 18:09.339
There it is.

18:12.717 --> 18:14.135
(August clears throat)

18:14.177 --> 18:16.805
If you'll let me
retrieve my luggage.

18:16.846 --> 18:19.098
Go for it.

18:40.119 --> 18:42.455
-(gasps)
-Oh! Fuck me.

18:42.497 --> 18:43.623
Hi.

18:43.665 --> 18:46.000
-God.
-Yeah.

18:46.042 --> 18:47.961
(laughs)

18:50.004 --> 18:51.297
What?

18:51.339 --> 18:53.466
I-I can't believe
you're in Israel.

18:53.508 --> 18:54.926
Well, I am everywhere.

18:54.968 --> 18:57.011
Well, n-no. No, no, no,
don't do that.

18:57.053 --> 18:58.471
You're not God.

18:58.513 --> 19:00.056
I-I-I realize that now.

19:00.098 --> 19:01.808
-Mm-hmm.
-(sighs)

19:01.850 --> 19:03.560
-I was insane.
-Mm-hmm.

19:03.601 --> 19:05.478
-And a little racist.
-Mm-hmm.

19:05.520 --> 19:06.563
Just a little racist.

19:06.604 --> 19:08.147
-Sorry.
-'Cause you made it about me

19:08.189 --> 19:10.650
and it's not about me.

19:10.692 --> 19:13.152
The Messiah consciousness
is everyone.

19:13.194 --> 19:14.821
You, me, everyone.

19:14.863 --> 19:19.659
But you were right about God
being a woman.

19:19.701 --> 19:22.036
And her name is Asherah.

19:22.078 --> 19:24.289
And she's being held
right here in Israel.

19:24.330 --> 19:25.748
What? Where?

19:25.790 --> 19:28.126
In Jerusalem,
under the Dome of the Rock.

19:29.460 --> 19:31.087
She's all of the water
in the world

19:31.129 --> 19:34.632
and all the world
and all the planet.

19:34.674 --> 19:35.800
What?

19:35.842 --> 19:37.260
What are you talking about?

19:37.302 --> 19:39.220
My friends just got kicked off
their land.

19:39.262 --> 19:41.389
Build a shelter over your head.

19:41.431 --> 19:44.976
Sit still, calm down, and trust
that the answers will come.

19:45.018 --> 19:47.145
Wait.

19:47.186 --> 19:49.689
Dr. Gunderson.

19:51.190 --> 19:54.277
Dr. Gunderson.

19:54.319 --> 19:56.321
(sighs)

19:57.614 --> 19:59.240
(laughter
and indistinct chatter)

19:59.282 --> 20:00.241
SHELLY:
All right.

20:00.283 --> 20:01.701
Here it is.

20:01.743 --> 20:03.578
-MAURA: Wow. Oh, my God.
-JOSH: Oh, my God.

20:03.620 --> 20:05.788
-DAVINA: Oh, my God.
-MAURA: Shelly Lipkind.

20:05.830 --> 20:08.416
Look how pretty you are.

20:08.458 --> 20:09.709
-DAVINA: That's fantastic.
-Thank you, honey.

20:09.751 --> 20:11.127
-JOSH: Mother's maiden name.
-Yeah.

20:11.169 --> 20:13.796
Security question numero uno.

20:13.838 --> 20:16.215

20:46.287 --> 20:47.956
I'm speaking to someone
who's sitting in a robe,

20:47.997 --> 20:49.791
-sitting on a couch.
-(laughter)

20:49.832 --> 20:51.834

You know, I wasn't
scared of him.

didn't look scared of him.
