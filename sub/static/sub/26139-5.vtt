10:04.794 --> 10:07.567
Okay, well, the first
time I felt something,

10:07.567 --> 10:09.891
I was at Dean & DeLuca with my brother.

10:09.894 --> 10:12.503
They had these little
samples of biscotti,

10:12.505 --> 10:15.254

when I started tingling

10:15.257 --> 10:16.738
and feeling weird.

10:16.741 --> 10:19.665
So I smacked the
biscotti out of his hand,

10:19.668 --> 10:22.970
and we found out that
he has celiac disease,

10:22.973 --> 10:24.582
