WEBVTT

00:00.330 --> 00:03.560
Well, got another one.

00:03.620 --> 00:04.570
Oh, boy.

00:04.710 --> 00:05.670
What's in the box?

00:05.810 --> 00:07.170
What's in the box?

00:07.240 --> 00:08.870
What's in the box?!

00:08.960 --> 00:11.630
What's in the box?!

00:11.720 --> 00:12.510
Right?

00:12.930 --> 00:14.750
Brad pitt? Seven?

00:15.850 --> 00:16.890
Nothing?

00:17.040 --> 00:18.130
Yeah, I'm the jerk.

00:18.600 --> 00:19.610
What's in the box?

00:20.430 --> 00:22.100
Well, ever since marshall and lily got their own place,

00:22.190 --> 00:23.500
His mom keeps sending them boxes

00:23.580 --> 00:25.260
Of his old stuff she's trying to get rid of.

00:25.720 --> 00:26.550
Thanks, mom.

00:26.640 --> 00:28.130
You really nailed it this time.

00:28.280 --> 00:30.700
I really needed he-man's right arm

00:30.800 --> 00:33.230
And this old book of mad libs.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.840
"fart went to the fart to fart fartly."

00:39.050 --> 00:40.350
That's nice.

00:40.410 --> 00:41.210
That's good stuff.

00:41.300 --> 00:42.260
That's good.

00:42.760 --> 00:43.700
Thanks, mom.

00:46.520 --> 00:47.230
Hello.

00:47.360 --> 00:48.260
Hello?

00:48.460 --> 00:50.440
- Ted mosby? - Yeah.

00:50.950 --> 00:53.670
The window is open.

00:55.970 --> 00:56.760
The what?

00:56.970 --> 00:59.300
The window is open.

01:02.240 --> 01:03.380
The window is open.

01:05.040 --> 01:05.840
What are you waiting for?

01:06.080 --> 01:08.020
- I... - Run, ted, run!

01:12.840 --> 01:14.670
Lily, the window is open.

01:14.750 --> 01:16.310
Make a hole, people.

01:16.950 --> 01:18.570
Run, ted, run!

01:24.830 --> 01:26.370
- Ted? - Hey.

01:26.550 --> 01:27.480
- Hey. - Maggie.

01:28.080 --> 01:29.480
I was just, um,

01:29.970 --> 01:30.780
You know...

01:31.330 --> 01:32.130
How are you?

01:32.330 --> 01:34.400
Um, I'm fine, I guess.

01:35.100 --> 01:37.480
Actually, no, I'm not fine.

01:37.600 --> 01:39.120
I just broke up with my boyfriend.

01:42.320 --> 01:43.040
I'm so sorry to hear that.

01:43.130 --> 01:44.460
No, it's...

01:45.060 --> 01:46.180
You want to hang out tonight?

01:47.920 --> 01:48.620
Sure.

02:01.950 --> 02:03.710
- It was so fun. You guys liked it. - It was the most...

02:04.450 --> 02:05.840
Please tell me you got in the window.

02:05.880 --> 02:06.970
I got in the window.

02:07.390 --> 02:08.990
- Yes! - what is going on?

02:09.070 --> 02:10.090
What is the window?

02:10.229 --> 02:11.860
You know how everyone has that guy

02:11.940 --> 02:13.280
Or girl who, no matter what happens,

02:13.440 --> 02:15.970
You always remember them being the perfect one for you?

02:16.450 --> 02:17.300
My chaps.

02:17.370 --> 02:17.920
Lily.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.380
That girl right over there.

02:20.520 --> 02:22.300
Well, that girl for me was

02:22.300 --> 02:25.000
and still is-- maggie wilks.

02:25.250 --> 02:26.540
We all went to college together.

02:26.620 --> 02:27.360
She was awesome.

02:27.420 --> 02:28.750
Everybody loved her.

02:28.940 --> 02:31.530
I think I know what we're dealing with here.

02:34.550 --> 02:36.000
Tell me when to stop.

02:36.080 --> 02:37.540
It wasn't that maggie was hot.

02:38.110 --> 02:38.890
She was...

02:38.990 --> 02:40.050
She was the ultimate girl next door.

02:40.050 --> 02:42.100
She was the ultimate girl next door.

02:42.100 --> 02:42.890
Still is.

02:42.890 --> 02:44.170
I mean, every guy who meets maggie

02:44.170 --> 02:45.380
Falls madly in love with her.

02:45.380 --> 02:46.610
And that's the problem.

02:46.610 --> 02:48.660
Since I've known her, she's only been single

02:48.660 --> 02:52.150
For, like, three brief windows of opportunity.

02:52.620 --> 02:53.480
When she moved here and broke up

02:53.590 --> 02:55.760
With her college boyfriend, I waited a month.

02:55.920 --> 02:57.850
You know, so I wouldn't be the rebound guy.

02:57.850 --> 03:01.360
Well, the rebound guy lasted two years.

03:02.840 --> 03:04.950
After they broke up, I only waited a week.

03:05.050 --> 03:06.650
I was still too late.

03:06.850 --> 03:09.190
She dated that guy for three years.

03:09.970 --> 03:12.200
The next time, I wasn't messing around.

03:12.200 --> 03:13.180
I was at her door

03:13.180 --> 03:15.530
Not one hour after they broke up.

03:15.530 --> 03:16.980
The only thing she did

03:16.980 --> 03:18.480
Between becoming single

03:18.480 --> 03:19.770
And the moment I got there

03:19.770 --> 03:21.510
Was go downstairs and check her mail.

03:22.310 --> 03:23.660
I was still too late.

03:23.920 --> 03:26.790
And she dated that guy for four years.

03:28.710 --> 03:30.080
I wasn't going to let this happen again,

03:30.310 --> 03:32.150
So I begged her neighbor, mrs. Douglas,

03:32.260 --> 03:34.290
To call me the second she and david broke up.

03:34.600 --> 03:36.600
And now, a very single

03:36.690 --> 03:38.160
And available maggie wilks

03:38.290 --> 03:39.970
Is on her way to this very spot.

03:39.970 --> 03:42.530
I sent a cab with a female driver,

03:42.530 --> 03:43.620
so she'd have no other interaction with a man

03:43.620 --> 03:45.360
until she got to me.

03:45.360 --> 03:47.410
Where she will still have no interaction with a man.

03:47.410 --> 03:48.500
What up?

03:49.480 --> 03:50.860
I feel good tonight.

03:50.860 --> 03:51.950
Tonight's going to be good.

03:54.320 --> 03:55.990
Oh, hell, yeah!

03:56.250 --> 03:57.450
It's my overalls.

03:57.620 --> 03:59.240
I wore these babies all throughout high school.

03:59.240 --> 04:00.080
These were my jam.

04:00.640 --> 04:02.480
God, you really were a virgin

04:02.480 --> 04:04.150
Before you met lily, weren't you?

04:05.190 --> 04:06.280
Well, that's unnecessary.

04:06.580 --> 04:07.830
Oh, she's right, baby.

04:07.830 --> 04:10.020
If... If you had worn these things in college,

04:10.020 --> 04:11.630
Even I wouldn't have slept with you.

04:11.630 --> 04:14.590
And, if you recall, I was good to go.

04:15.090 --> 04:17.000
No one, I mean no one.

04:17.100 --> 04:19.490
Could get laid wearing these.

04:20.300 --> 04:21.779
Challenge accepted.

04:22.380 --> 04:24.150
I, barney stinson,

04:24.410 --> 04:26.740
Being of sound mind and amazing body,

04:26.740 --> 04:29.920
Will wear these overalls until I have sex with a woman.

04:32.040 --> 04:33.840
I actually dated that guy.

04:34.330 --> 04:35.770
Okay. Quick game plan.

04:35.890 --> 04:38.340
Maggie shows up, couple minutes of hugs and hi's,

04:38.460 --> 04:39.690
And then everybody's out of here.

04:39.850 --> 04:41.030
This is my one shot.

04:41.610 --> 04:43.170
I am not gonna screw this up.

04:43.320 --> 04:44.930
Who'd you get to cover your class tonight?

04:45.090 --> 04:46.610
- Crap! - oh, my god!

04:49.370 --> 04:50.340
Oh, my goodness.

04:50.410 --> 04:51.450
- Hey, stranger. - Hey.

04:51.560 --> 04:53.270
- Maggie, this is my roommate, robin. - Hey.

04:53.270 --> 04:55.790
- Hey. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, too.

04:55.790 --> 04:59.170
Um, I totally forgot, I have to teach a class tonight.

04:59.170 --> 05:00.820
Hey! want to come with me

05:00.820 --> 05:03.100
And check out a real live architecture class?

05:03.100 --> 05:04.950
Ooh. Not even a little bit.

05:04.950 --> 05:06.620
Uh, you know, I'll just hang here with marshall.

05:06.620 --> 05:08.780
- It'll be fun. - Fantastic.

05:08.780 --> 05:09.990
Okay. Well, have a seat.

05:09.990 --> 05:11.690
Relax. Yeah.

05:11.690 --> 05:13.250
Yeah, this is casual.

05:13.250 --> 05:16.740
This is all very, very, very casual.

05:17.070 --> 05:18.860
Listen to me. You want me to find the perfect girl

05:18.930 --> 05:19.990
So we can all grow old together?

05:19.990 --> 05:21.290
That is her.

05:21.290 --> 05:23.420
Do not let any guy near her, okay?

05:23.420 --> 05:24.880
That means no waiter takes her order,

05:24.880 --> 05:26.260
No busboy clears her table.

05:26.260 --> 05:27.690
If she bursts into flames,

05:27.690 --> 05:30.010
I want a fire woman putting her out.

05:30.010 --> 05:32.330
I don't think 911 takes requests.

05:32.330 --> 05:33.140
Damn it, marshall!

05:33.140 --> 05:34.180
Whatever you have to do,

05:34.300 --> 05:36.900
Keep maggie wilks single until I get back.

05:40.140 --> 05:41.420
I left my tab open.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.080
Don't abuse it.

05:49.800 --> 05:50.450
Target secure?

05:50.450 --> 05:51.910
Target secure.

05:53.050 --> 05:55.370
Oh, my gosh. How weird.

05:55.610 --> 05:57.940
We all walked out of the bathroom at the same time.

05:57.940 --> 06:00.190
Well, let's all walk back to the booth together.

06:03.180 --> 06:07.280
Oh, my. Look at this-- the table where we are sitting.

06:07.280 --> 06:08.200
Back off!

06:12.040 --> 06:14.540
Okay, um, not that I care about this challenge,

06:14.540 --> 06:17.160
But it's cheating to wear overalls over a suit.

06:17.160 --> 06:18.020
No, it's not.

06:18.020 --> 06:20.700
They're not called over t-shirts, robin.

06:20.700 --> 06:22.750
They're not called over shirtless fat guys

06:22.750 --> 06:24.170
Who used to come fix my mom's car

06:24.170 --> 06:25.950
And then hang out with her upstairs for a little while.

06:25.950 --> 06:29.100
No. They're called overalls, okay?

06:29.100 --> 06:30.470
And I can wear them over whatever I want.

06:32.900 --> 06:34.350
He's not saying hello

06:34.350 --> 06:36.280
He's just telling you what he feeds his horses.

06:38.220 --> 06:40.130
Oh, man, I can sit here

06:40.130 --> 06:43.630
and make you-look-like-a-farmer jokes All night.

06:44.080 --> 06:45.370
Challenge accepted.

06:47.180 --> 06:48.140
Good evening.

06:48.250 --> 06:49.870
Tonight, we're gonna have a nice, quick class on bridges.

06:49.870 --> 06:51.220
There are six types of bridges.

06:51.220 --> 06:53.980
Beam, cantilever, arch, suspension, and two others.

06:53.980 --> 06:55.610
You got land on both sides, water in the middle.

06:55.610 --> 06:56.490
See you all next week.

06:56.490 --> 06:59.170
Hey, we get you for the whole hour.

06:59.170 --> 07:00.910
Oh, come on. I mean, who really wants to sit here

07:00.910 --> 07:02.960
And listen to me yap about bridges for an hour?

07:04.370 --> 07:05.330
Really?

07:07.410 --> 07:09.750
I just thought about how awesome ted is again.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.030
This is a weird drinking game.

07:15.120 --> 07:16.330
Can I buy you a drink?

07:16.330 --> 07:20.090
He's got a big brown jug with three x's on it.

07:20.090 --> 07:21.690
What have I done?

07:22.970 --> 07:26.680
One very important thing to keep in mind

07:26.680 --> 07:29.860
When designing a bridge...

07:29.860 --> 07:31.010
Maggie?

07:31.980 --> 07:32.970
Oh, no.

07:33.470 --> 07:34.500
I mean, yes.

07:34.600 --> 07:37.980
Yes, when you are designing a bridge, always remenber

07:38.100 --> 07:43.950
Make adjustments... ...Go get it energized.

07:46.050 --> 07:47.480
That's good advice for life, too.

07:48.370 --> 07:49.810
So, professor mosby,

07:50.490 --> 07:52.890
Is this maggie someone special?

07:52.890 --> 07:54.780
No. I...

07:54.780 --> 07:58.500
She's just this girl I've been into for a really long time,

07:58.500 --> 07:59.670
And, well, tonight could be

07:59.670 --> 08:01.810
The one chance I have to go out with her, so...

08:04.310 --> 08:05.230
Is she a hottie?

08:05.770 --> 08:07.750
Yes, jamie. She's very attractive.

08:08.020 --> 08:09.450
And if we can just end class right now...

08:09.930 --> 08:10.870
Betty?

08:11.220 --> 08:13.410
Maggie may finally be available,

08:13.410 --> 08:15.470
But what about you, professor mosby?

08:15.470 --> 08:17.960
Are you ready for a serious relationship?

08:18.570 --> 08:19.350
Totally.

08:20.770 --> 08:21.690
I mean, I think so.

08:22.570 --> 08:23.250
Maybe.

08:24.130 --> 08:25.440
I don't know. What do you guys think?

08:30.210 --> 08:32.429
Oh, my gosh. I totally forgot about this.

08:32.429 --> 08:33.309
What is it?

08:33.309 --> 08:34.390
It's a homework assignment

08:34.390 --> 08:35.590
From when I was 15.

08:35.590 --> 08:38.039
Um, write a letter to your 30-year-old self

08:38.039 --> 08:39.929
With a list of goals you hope to achieve.

08:42.289 --> 08:43.270
Dear future me.

08:43.990 --> 08:45.980
First off, you'd better be driving either

08:45.980 --> 08:49.490
A kick-ass camaro or the a-team van.

08:49.490 --> 08:52.400
That's priority numero uno.

08:52.400 --> 08:53.560
And by now your rat tail

08:53.560 --> 08:55.730
Should hang down to your freakin' knees.

08:56.480 --> 08:58.320
You can still slam-dunk, obviously,

08:58.420 --> 09:01.320
And you've legally changed your name to "vanilla thunder."

09:02.270 --> 09:04.170
Your wife, let me break it down

09:04.200 --> 09:06.300
Blonde, six feet tall,

09:06.300 --> 09:09.770
Has an awesome rack and caters to your every need.

09:11.530 --> 09:12.750
- Sorry, babe. - That's okay.

09:12.850 --> 09:14.450
You just described your mother.

09:14.450 --> 09:15.460
Keep going.

09:15.460 --> 09:17.360
You're still rocking...

09:17.360 --> 09:19.090
You're still rocking the stone-washed overalls,

09:19.180 --> 09:21.190
Because this look is working.

09:21.760 --> 09:23.970
Oh, and most importantly,

09:23.970 --> 09:25.930
You'd better be saving the world.

09:25.930 --> 09:28.450
If you became some lame, corporate sellout,

09:28.450 --> 09:30.900
Just throw yourself off a cliff

09:30.900 --> 09:33.830
Because you suck.

09:33.830 --> 09:36.430
And I licky boom-boom down.

09:37.550 --> 09:38.870
Snow me I'll go blame

09:38.870 --> 09:40.510
A licky boom-boom down...

09:42.950 --> 09:44.300
Yeah, hilarious.

09:44.640 --> 09:46.660
I became a lame, corporate sellout.

09:46.660 --> 09:48.050
I work for GNB,

09:48.050 --> 09:49.900
The most evil bank in the history of the world.

09:49.900 --> 09:51.320
Oh, come on, vanilla thunder,

09:51.320 --> 09:53.230
Everyone's got to grow up and get a real job.

09:53.230 --> 09:56.230
Yeah, I remember back in college Maggie wanted to be

09:56.230 --> 09:59.520
A marine biologist by day and mentor

09:59.520 --> 10:01.460
Inner-city kids by night.

10:01.460 --> 10:03.650
What did you really end up doing?

10:03.850 --> 10:04.920
Those things.

10:09.990 --> 10:11.080
Baby, where are you going?

10:11.670 --> 10:13.330
I just gotta, I gotta do something at work.

10:13.530 --> 10:14.420
It won't take long.

10:16.090 --> 10:17.060
What's up with Marshall?

10:18.560 --> 10:20.690
Oh, no.

10:20.690 --> 10:22.940
I think he's going to quit his job.

10:22.940 --> 10:25.050
I'm sorry, Maggie. I gotta go stop him.

10:35.960 --> 10:37.840
Ted, I had to leave the bar, but it's okay.

10:37.940 --> 10:39.280
I left Maggie with Robin.

10:39.380 --> 10:41.340
You left Maggie with Robin?

10:42.400 --> 10:43.670
Relax.

10:43.760 --> 10:45.740
I've got things under control.

10:45.850 --> 10:47.110
You don't understand the situation.

10:47.110 --> 10:50.430
This girl is like a super-powered man magnet.

10:50.430 --> 10:51.420
Oh, Teddy.

10:51.420 --> 10:53.950
I know a little something about man magnets.

10:53.950 --> 10:55.430
You see, your friend may be one of those magnets

10:55.430 --> 10:58.010
That can hold up a picture of your kids on the fridge,

10:58.010 --> 10:59.510
But I'm one of those magnets

10:59.510 --> 11:02.330
That can pick up cars in a junkyard.

11:03.830 --> 11:05.090
- Who's this?  - Robin,

11:05.090 --> 11:06.890
This is Jim, a good friend of mine from work.

11:06.890 --> 11:10.710
Oh, well, hello there.

11:10.710 --> 11:11.460
Nice to meet you.

11:12.950 --> 11:13.570
Oh, boy.

11:17.150 --> 11:20.300
What does being "ready" even mean?

11:20.300 --> 11:21.840
I mean, I thought I was "ready" last year.

11:21.840 --> 11:24.630
I wound up getting left at the altar.

11:24.630 --> 11:26.010
I'll be honest, guys.

11:27.120 --> 11:28.030
I'm a little scared.

11:30.200 --> 11:31.960
Okay, Louis, then Betty.

11:31.960 --> 11:34.170
We're all scared, professor Mosby.

11:35.040 --> 11:36.600
Doesn't being scared let you know

11:36.600 --> 11:39.710
you're on to something important?

11:39.710 --> 11:40.960
Yeah.

11:40.960 --> 11:43.030
I mean, if you're not scared, you're not taking a chance.

11:43.030 --> 11:45.400
And if you're not taking a chance,

11:45.400 --> 11:47.120
Then what the hell are you doing?

11:47.870 --> 11:48.650
Right?

11:52.080 --> 11:53.050
I think you're ready, bro.

12:00.450 --> 12:01.520
Jim, you are so funny.

12:01.640 --> 12:04.550
Funny? I think he's hilarious.

12:04.700 --> 12:06.240
In fact, I laughed so hard,

12:06.330 --> 12:08.930
I think I may have just peed my pants.

12:12.690 --> 12:13.830
I'd better take off.

12:13.910 --> 12:15.970
I'm going to the opening of that photography

12:16.060 --> 12:17.440
Exhibit]  that they were talking by the work

12:17.610 --> 12:19.130
Les chiens erotiques.

12:20.010 --> 12:21.970
- I have an extra ticket if you want to...  - Me?!

12:22.730 --> 12:24.070
I'd love to!

12:26.490 --> 12:28.060
All right, I gotta go.

12:28.800 --> 12:30.340
One last piece of advice.

12:31.180 --> 12:32.140
Make adjustments...

12:32.750 --> 12:35.100
Go get it energized!

12:41.580 --> 12:42.360
Hello?

12:43.020 --> 12:43.960
Ted, change of plans.

12:44.450 --> 12:46.220
You left her with Barney?!

12:46.580 --> 12:48.320
Ted, will you take it easy?

12:48.570 --> 12:49.530
I'm your bro.

12:49.670 --> 12:50.710
You're an animal.

12:51.020 --> 12:52.870
And even though our bro-lationship

12:52.990 --> 12:54.890
Has suffered its setbacks in this area,

12:54.990 --> 12:57.200
I assure you I will be the perfect gentleman.

12:57.470 --> 12:58.890
Oh, thanks.

12:59.640 --> 13:01.330
By the way, I really like those overalls.

13:01.470 --> 13:02.260
You have ten minutes to get down

13:02.350 --> 13:03.420
here or the window's closing.

13:03.780 --> 13:05.100
- Ten minutes? - Yeah.

13:05.530 --> 13:07.040
Because we're bros.

13:12.900 --> 13:14.800
While I was racing through the streets of New York,

13:14.800 --> 13:16.030
Trying to get back to the bar,

13:16.310 --> 13:17.730
Your aunt Robin was doing her best

13:17.730 --> 13:19.200
To keep Jim away from Maggie.

13:21.090 --> 13:21.670
Do you want to go back to the bar

13:21.740 --> 13:22.660
and see if Maggie's still there?

13:22.780 --> 13:24.300
Oh, no way!

13:24.400 --> 13:26.410
I love erotic dog photography.

13:26.490 --> 13:27.580
Did you see the one over there

13:27.630 --> 13:29.250
Of the corgies doing it people style?

13:30.810 --> 13:31.710
I'll get us a taxi.

13:31.710 --> 13:33.650
I just feel bad leaving Maggie all alone.

13:33.650 --> 13:36.610
No! Uh, let's have a glass of wine first.

13:40.790 --> 13:42.760
Oh, man.

13:43.450 --> 13:46.440
Oh, look how filthy I am.

13:46.920 --> 13:47.920
I am just a...

13:48.110 --> 13:50.720
A filthy, filthy girl who would totally

13:50.820 --> 13:53.790
Go to second base with a guy as a favor to a friend.

13:55.640 --> 13:58.510
You like that?

14:00.610 --> 14:02.190
I'm going to call Maggie, see what she's doing.

14:02.780 --> 14:04.990
Oh, god! Maggie, Maggie, Maggie.

14:05.080 --> 14:06.580
Give it a rest, jeez!

14:06.680 --> 14:07.840
She's hanging out with Ted tonight.

14:08.060 --> 14:09.820
Ted? What about David?

14:09.970 --> 14:10.970
They broke up.

14:11.480 --> 14:12.330
Maggie's single?

14:13.030 --> 14:14.250
That doesn't sound familiar.

14:17.970 --> 14:19.970
Can I help wipe that off?

14:21.050 --> 14:22.160
Please?

14:25.710 --> 14:27.410
I hate Barney.Stinson!

14:27.410 --> 14:28.380
Me, too!

14:30.960 --> 14:32.920
Lily finally got to GNB,

14:32.920 --> 14:34.390
But the place was deserted.

14:41.110 --> 14:41.800
Hey, baby.

14:42.950 --> 14:44.910
I thought you came here to quit your job.

14:44.910 --> 14:47.080
I forgot about the hoop.

14:47.080 --> 14:49.670
Yeah. I-I thought if I could just do one thing

14:49.670 --> 14:51.450
In that letter, I wouldn't feel like such an old sellout,

14:51.450 --> 14:55.060
So I came out here to dunk.

14:55.060 --> 14:57.620
Did it make you feel better?

14:57.620 --> 14:59.710
I barely grazed the bottom of the net,

14:59.710 --> 15:02.150
And now my legs hurt so bad, I can't even fall down.

15:06.580 --> 15:07.620
How could you?!

15:07.860 --> 15:10.250
Ted, I challenged myself

15:10.250 --> 15:11.770
To get laid wearing overalls.

15:11.770 --> 15:14.110
And if you stand in my way, then you're letting Barney win.

15:14.110 --> 15:16.170
And you don't want that. That smug son of a bitch will

15:16.170 --> 15:17.850
Never let us hear the end of it.

15:17.850 --> 15:18.990
Oh, thank god. Maggie...

15:19.140 --> 15:21.930
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. - Where do you think you're going?

15:21.930 --> 15:23.000
To tell that girl I love her.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.210
- Get in line, bub. - Yeah.

15:24.210 --> 15:25.810
I'm going to have sex with her, then he's

15:25.810 --> 15:27.890
Going to tell her he's in love with her, and then you can do

15:27.890 --> 15:30.190
Whatever you want. Do we agree on the order?

15:30.570 --> 15:31.380
Mister!

15:31.760 --> 15:35.410
You missed just out on the night of your life.

15:35.410 --> 15:38.090
The night of your life.

15:44.610 --> 15:45.820
I've been in love with her for five years.

15:45.890 --> 15:47.770
I've been in love with her for 12 years.

15:47.770 --> 15:50.150
I've been in these overalls for an hour and a half.

15:52.830 --> 15:55.340
Maybe you can't dunk anymore.

15:55.340 --> 15:56.390
But you've achieved

15:56.390 --> 15:58.110
More in your 30 years than that

15:58.110 --> 16:00.930
15-year-old dweeb could ever dream of.

16:00.930 --> 16:01.720
You put yourself

16:01.720 --> 16:03.040
Through Columbia law school.

16:03.040 --> 16:05.890
You had the sense to chop off that stupid rat tail.

16:05.890 --> 16:08.610
And you married a smoking-hot chick

16:08.610 --> 16:09.730
Who looks nothing like your mother.

16:10.990 --> 16:12.300
I think that earns you

16:12.410 --> 16:15.200
An entire foot closer to dunking.

16:17.260 --> 16:18.730
There you go, vanilla thunder.

16:21.780 --> 16:22.560
Step back.

16:36.370 --> 16:37.530
Oh, baby.

16:38.150 --> 16:40.830
How about instead of dunking, we go up to your office,

16:40.830 --> 16:43.480
And you lie very still while I go bananas all over you?

16:44.520 --> 16:47.360
Could we maybe instead just do it right here?

16:47.360 --> 16:48.460
Sure, baby.

16:49.310 --> 16:50.760
- She loves me! - But I chose her! - Guys! Guys!

16:50.820 --> 16:52.680
Guys, we have to figure this out.

16:52.870 --> 16:54.830
We are dealing with a very small window of opportunity here.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.740
Guys, let me assure you, if you let me in there,

16:56.840 --> 16:59.370
That window's gonna open up again in, like, ten minutes.

17:01.720 --> 17:02.590
Wait, where's maggie?

17:02.720 --> 17:04.640
- She's gone. -What? - I sent her home.

17:04.760 --> 17:06.800
You guys were like vultures fighting over her.

17:06.900 --> 17:08.020
Let her be single for once.

17:08.170 --> 17:09.800
- Jealous bitch! - Robin, how could you?!

17:10.140 --> 17:11.130
No, she's right.

17:11.970 --> 17:14.079
Maggie deserves some time to herself.

17:14.839 --> 17:17.619
Nobody likes to be alone, especially after a breakup,

17:17.770 --> 17:20.760
But that's when we discover who we really are

17:22.359 --> 17:23.750
And... And what we really want.

17:24.589 --> 17:25.589
She deserves that.

17:26.060 --> 17:27.450
And kids, I meant that.

17:27.589 --> 17:30.110
Which is why I'm not proud of what happened next.

17:37.170 --> 17:39.460
It's around the corner. Around the corner.

17:46.210 --> 17:47.270
Hey. Maggie, sorry.

17:47.270 --> 17:48.570
Class ran a little...

17:49.150 --> 17:50.040
Who's this?

17:50.320 --> 17:51.680
This is Adam.

17:52.430 --> 17:53.330
It's so crazy.

17:53.410 --> 17:54.760
We grew up next door to each other.

17:54.850 --> 17:56.570
God, we haven't seen each other since...

17:57.240 --> 17:58.330
- A long time. - Yeah.

17:58.690 --> 18:01.130
And then Maggie Wilks told us

18:01.180 --> 18:03.260
The second-greatest love story I've ever heard.

18:30.140 --> 18:32.060
I just moved to town and I had to look her up.

18:33.550 --> 18:35.440
I guess we've got a lot of catching up to do.

18:35.570 --> 18:36.140
Yeah.

18:36.740 --> 18:37.780
Yeah, of course.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.770
So, kids, I missed out on the ultimate girl next door

18:41.770 --> 18:42.910
To the guy next door.

18:45.000 --> 18:45.870
See you next time.

18:47.020 --> 18:48.300
There was no "next time."

18:48.960 --> 18:51.000
Maggie's window never opened again.

18:58.320 --> 18:59.740
Hey! Hey, I got it!

18:59.740 --> 19:01.200
That country bar, giddy-ups!

19:01.200 --> 19:02.770
The overalls have gotta work there.

19:02.770 --> 19:03.460
Wingman me?

19:04.160 --> 19:05.500
I don't want giddy-ups.

19:06.660 --> 19:07.520
I want that.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.120
I forgot what it feels like to chase the real thing,

19:11.250 --> 19:14.100
But... I think I'm ready again.

19:16.080 --> 19:16.800
Yeah.

19:18.470 --> 19:19.980
Let me tell you where I'm at.

19:21.570 --> 19:22.980
I want to have sex with a girl

19:22.980 --> 19:24.490
So I can take off these overalls.

19:26.520 --> 19:27.720
Come on. Come on!

19:27.800 --> 19:29.150
Ted, you gotta help me!

19:29.190 --> 19:30.780
I gotta get these damn things off!

19:32.000 --> 19:33.030
Hey there.

19:36.460 --> 19:39.270
I just love your overalls.

20:00.820 --> 20:02.380
Dear 60-year-old Marshall.

20:02.920 --> 20:04.470
By now you should be working somewhere

20:04.470 --> 20:05.870
That's making the world a better place,

20:05.870 --> 20:07.840
Or at least trying to.

20:07.840 --> 20:10.280
No pressure, dude. I mean, sir.

20:11.600 --> 20:14.900
Also, if time travel is possible,

20:14.900 --> 20:17.500
Maybe you could give me a little sign

20:17.820 --> 20:22.700
On Tuesday, December 8, at 8:29 P.M.

20:29.190 --> 20:31.320
So, someone sent back these chicken wings,

20:31.390 --> 20:33.430
Because they were too hot. And I'm like,

20:33.770 --> 20:35.340
"Too hot? Are you crazy?"

20:35.720 --> 20:36.720
So, free wings.

20:37.890 --> 20:38.990
Old man Marshall,

20:39.280 --> 20:40.800
As long as you're still married to Lily,

20:41.360 --> 20:42.390
You're doing just fine.

20:47.420 --> 20:48.970
Sir, this is on us.

20:48.970 --> 20:50.160
Sorry the wings were so hot.

20:50.580 --> 20:54.030
Oh, no, dear. It wasn't that they were too hot.

20:54.030 --> 20:55.790
It's just that I had wings earlier.

20:58.050 --> 20:59.880
Much earlier.
