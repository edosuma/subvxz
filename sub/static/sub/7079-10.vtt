00:12.679 --> 00:14.473
Three weeks earlier.

00:15.015 --> 00:16.808
Huh?

00:17.100 --> 00:18.500
You know sometimes
a movie or a show

00:18.644 --> 00:20.964
begins on a random, intriguing
scene with no context given,

00:21.063 --> 00:22.105
encouraging you to wonder,

00:22.397 --> 00:24.157
"Whoa! How'd this crazy
scenario come to be,"

00:24.233 --> 00:25.668
and then it cuts to black
and a title comes up

00:25.692 --> 00:27.236
that says,
"Three weeks earlier?"

00:27.528 --> 00:28.987
Uh-huh. ABED: Here we are,

00:29.279 --> 00:31.031
sitting in silence,
crammed into an RV,

00:31.323 --> 00:32.884
winding through the
mountain roads of Colorado

00:32.908 --> 00:35.452
with a 19-foot fiber glass
hand tied to the roof.

00:37.746 --> 00:42.834
If there was ever a time to cut to three
weeks earlier, it would be right now.

00:43.126 --> 00:44.294
You know what I mean?

00:53.178 --> 00:55.681
Elroy, you got any booze?

00:55.973 --> 00:58.308
Don't go through my stuff.
This isn't a bus.

00:58.600 --> 01:00.537
You're standing in my living
room, kitchen, and bedroom.

01:00.561 --> 01:01.841
Ooh, I never thought about that.

01:02.020 --> 01:06.191
And your backyard
is 24,900 miles long.

01:06.483 --> 01:09.486
Because it's the circumference
of the Earth.

01:09.778 --> 01:12.322
Because you... have no home.

01:12.614 --> 01:14.592
Does anyone need water? What
else should we talk about?

01:14.616 --> 01:16.056
I guess to make
it really intriguing,

01:16.201 --> 01:17.554
one of us should be
visibly injured in a way

01:17.578 --> 01:18.805
that makes you wonder
how it happened.

01:18.829 --> 01:20.069
Like if Britta had a black eye.

01:21.915 --> 01:22.915
Dean...

01:23.166 --> 01:24.376
can I speak to you privately?

01:24.668 --> 01:26.461
I'm pretty sure
the answer is no.

01:26.753 --> 01:27.879
I'm coming up.

01:33.552 --> 01:35.971
You know, when I agreed
to haul this thing

01:36.263 --> 01:37.389
for you and the school,

01:37.681 --> 01:39.867
you didn't say anything about
six people sitting back there.

01:39.891 --> 01:41.852
Man, I wonder
what they're talking about.

01:42.144 --> 01:43.270
God, who knows?

01:43.562 --> 01:46.565
They're sealed off behind
this soundproof vinyl.

01:46.857 --> 01:48.650
I will drive my house
off a cliff.

01:48.942 --> 01:51.486
Elroy, we're not here
to snoop or judge you.

01:51.778 --> 01:53.739
You're not the first person
to have dirty dishes,

01:54.031 --> 01:55.324
CD-ROM porn,

01:55.616 --> 01:57.492
and framed photos of yourself

01:57.784 --> 02:00.037
with two bi-racial
teenagers in a park.

02:00.329 --> 02:01.705
It's not that.

02:01.997 --> 02:03.415
All this weight.

02:04.249 --> 02:05.834
I may have...

02:06.126 --> 02:09.253
miscalculated the mileage.

02:10.964 --> 02:13.342
Darn it.
I want to hijack this RV,

02:13.634 --> 02:16.970
but I'm foiled by its impenetrable
post-2001 security measures.

02:17.262 --> 02:18.889
You keep driving and nobody else

02:19.181 --> 02:20.807
needs to know about this,
understand?

02:21.099 --> 02:24.227
The last thing
we need is a panic.

02:24.519 --> 02:26.021
What's going on?
Are we out of gas?

02:26.313 --> 02:29.107
Yes! It's on empty!
It's on empty!

02:29.399 --> 02:31.902
Never seen anything like it.
The needle is invisible.

02:32.194 --> 02:33.445
Oh, my God.

02:33.737 --> 02:35.840
There's no needle. It's gone.
It's underneath the plastic.

02:35.864 --> 02:38.116
Or maybe the engine
tried to use it as fuel.

02:38.408 --> 02:40.369
Oh, stop yelling! Well,
stop being out of gas!

02:40.661 --> 02:41.787
You're freaking me out!

02:42.079 --> 02:44.349
You should be freaking out. I
have been driving for 25 years

02:44.373 --> 02:48.251
and I have never seen
so little gas in my life.

02:48.543 --> 02:49.543
Stop, stop!

02:49.795 --> 02:51.213
I'm yelling even louder,

02:51.505 --> 02:53.131
so you have to stop!

02:53.423 --> 02:56.301
We're not in control
of the gas, okay?

02:56.593 --> 02:59.304
We have to focus
on what we can control.

02:59.596 --> 03:01.014
Is everyone's phone charged?

03:01.306 --> 03:03.306
Yes, charge your phones! Good idea.
Smart thinking.

03:04.309 --> 03:06.770
Okay. Okay, see?

03:07.062 --> 03:09.398
We turn panic into preparedness.

03:09.690 --> 03:11.441
Now, if we do run out of gas,

03:11.733 --> 03:14.111
guess who's got fully
charged phones?

03:14.403 --> 03:16.238
- Well charged.
- Full battery.

03:16.530 --> 03:19.116
For the love
of God, stop charging your phones!

03:32.003 --> 03:33.630
Excuse me a moment.

03:35.757 --> 03:37.117
What happened?
I'm not telling you!

03:37.384 --> 03:38.385
Fair enough.

03:38.677 --> 03:40.679
We're all gonna die.

03:40.971 --> 03:44.099
♪ Give me some rope
Tie me to dream

03:44.391 --> 03:47.269
♪ Give me the hope
to run out of steam

03:47.561 --> 03:50.772
♪ Somebody said it can be here

03:51.064 --> 03:54.693
♪ We could be roped up,
tied up, dead in a year

03:54.985 --> 03:59.406
♪ I can't count the reasons
I should stay

03:59.698 --> 04:03.702
♪ One by one they all
just fade away ♪

04:12.252 --> 04:14.045
All in favor?

04:14.337 --> 04:16.380
Then that solves the matter
of the giant hand.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.048
If there's no other business...

04:18.341 --> 04:19.902
Yes, I'd like to move that
we establish this moment

04:19.926 --> 04:21.154
as the opening for a flashback.

04:21.178 --> 04:22.387
No, meeting adjourned.

04:31.521 --> 04:33.875
Oh, I guess we're not doing the
"three weeks earlier" thing.

04:33.899 --> 04:35.984
Abed, insert dialogue here
about you dropping

04:36.276 --> 04:37.778
the fourth wall shtick. Nice.

04:38.069 --> 04:39.237
Careful you don't flood it.

04:39.529 --> 04:41.841
That's the fifth time you've
reminded me not to flood something.

04:41.865 --> 04:43.785
I'm sorry, but it doesn't
apply to our situation.

04:44.034 --> 04:45.702
I'm going to check the battery.

04:45.994 --> 04:47.996
Can you send someone or not?

04:48.288 --> 04:50.499
Can you please hold?
No, I can't hold.

04:51.792 --> 04:52.876
Darn it.

04:53.168 --> 04:55.378
When they put you on hold,
you hang up,

04:55.670 --> 04:56.922
and you call right back.

04:57.214 --> 04:58.256
Frankie taught me that.

04:58.548 --> 04:59.716
Hi, it's me.

05:00.008 --> 05:01.468
Yeah, the one you put on hold.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.136
See where that got you?

05:03.428 --> 05:04.614
- Can you send somebody or not?
- Please hold.

05:04.638 --> 05:06.014
Don't you dare.

05:06.306 --> 05:09.017
When they put you on hold,
hang up, and call right back.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.186
I can play this game all day.

05:11.478 --> 05:13.605
I told you we need
roadside service on...

05:13.897 --> 05:14.897
Can you please hold?

05:15.065 --> 05:16.065
Oh, you can't be serious.

05:16.274 --> 05:18.235
Well, hello! Guess who?

05:18.527 --> 05:20.237
I got nothing
but fingers and time, pal.

05:20.529 --> 05:22.989
Roadside service, Moffitt Pass.

05:24.741 --> 05:26.461
Well, you could've
told me that an hour ago.

05:26.743 --> 05:28.023
Your RV is full of crazy ladies.

05:28.161 --> 05:31.957
Your RV is full of crazy ladies.
Good-bye.

05:32.249 --> 05:34.459
Have any of you heard
of Armed Forces Day?

05:34.751 --> 05:35.911
Because apparently it's today

05:35.961 --> 05:37.128
and it's really boning us.

05:37.420 --> 05:38.463
Yeah, here it is.

05:38.755 --> 05:40.549
Armed Forces Day, huh.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.342
Why would they put it in May?

05:42.634 --> 05:44.514
It's just sitting there
in Memorial Day's shadow

05:44.803 --> 05:46.179
like a military Hanukkah.

05:46.471 --> 05:47.671
Fitting that both war holidays

05:47.931 --> 05:49.975
have to fight each other
over the same month.

05:50.267 --> 05:52.537
Notable that the one we remember is
the one with the theme of memory.

05:52.561 --> 05:53.841
Way to make this
about justifying

05:54.062 --> 05:55.355
your unmarketable sensibility.

05:55.647 --> 05:57.941
Well, apparently,
Armed Forces Day

05:58.233 --> 06:00.402
is the big one
for tow truck drivers

06:00.694 --> 06:03.321
because there are three
within 200 miles of this spot

06:03.613 --> 06:05.115
and they're all
in the same parade.

06:05.407 --> 06:07.534
Maybe it'll come by this way

06:07.826 --> 06:09.035
if we offer them...

06:09.327 --> 06:10.620
instruments?

06:10.912 --> 06:12.372
Nobody re-routes parades.

06:12.664 --> 06:14.207
They re-routed Kennedy's parade.

06:14.499 --> 06:17.436
So, we'll just call the CIA, tell them
we want to assassinate the President,

06:17.460 --> 06:19.105
and we'll be home in time
for Wheel of Fortune.

06:19.129 --> 06:21.089
Who are we kidding?
That'll never work.

06:21.381 --> 06:22.381
We got Britta'd.

06:22.549 --> 06:24.342
Yes, I use it too.

06:24.634 --> 06:27.554
I don't want anybody here
blaming themselves for this.

06:27.846 --> 06:29.139
I want everyone blaming Frankie.

06:29.431 --> 06:30.473
What? Me?

06:30.765 --> 06:32.368
That's stupid. She is
the reason we are here.

06:32.392 --> 06:33.602
This is what happens

06:33.894 --> 06:36.062
when you make decisions
outside the moment.

06:36.354 --> 06:37.981
Whatever moment
you were in the day

06:38.273 --> 06:40.273
you got on the internet
and bought a gigantic hand,

06:40.442 --> 06:43.403
I am proud to remain
outside until I die.

06:43.695 --> 06:44.695
You will, baby.

06:44.863 --> 06:47.407
And this is where logic
gets you.

06:47.699 --> 06:50.243
Stuck in a rocky mountain pass
at sundown,

06:50.535 --> 06:51.995
gradually freezing to death

06:52.287 --> 06:53.580
and forced to decide
somewhere...

06:53.872 --> 06:56.041
in the backs of our heads,
just in case,

06:56.333 --> 06:57.626
who we'd eat first.
Annie, right?

06:57.918 --> 06:58.958
What? It's not a judgment.

06:59.044 --> 07:00.462
It's about biology. What?

07:00.754 --> 07:01.796
Craig...

07:02.088 --> 07:04.215
the hand currently
crushing our lives

07:04.507 --> 07:05.776
is not about being
in the moment.

07:05.800 --> 07:07.680
You bought this thing
we can't return with money

07:07.761 --> 07:09.220
we don't have, nobody knows why,

07:09.512 --> 07:11.431
and your latest idea
is to put it on the quad

07:11.723 --> 07:14.392
with a plaque that says,
"Give a hand to your brain."

07:14.684 --> 07:16.227
Give your brain a hand.

07:16.519 --> 07:18.839
You're making it sound stupid on purpose.
It's over, Craig.

07:19.064 --> 07:20.440
You are lucky to have Frankie.

07:20.732 --> 07:22.772
And you're lucky she was
able to find some weirdo...

07:22.859 --> 07:23.859
excuse me...

07:24.027 --> 07:27.072
bigger weirdo on eBay
willing to pay cash for it.

07:27.364 --> 07:28.657
This is a lot of narrative pipe.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.010
Maybe we didn't need a "three
weeks earlier" flashback.

07:31.034 --> 07:32.202
Abed, is this a show?

07:32.494 --> 07:34.663
I thought you said you knew
it wasn't a TV show.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.373
Season two, you mean?
I don't know.

07:36.665 --> 07:38.265
- I can change my mind.
- Well, can I ask

07:38.333 --> 07:41.086
that it not be a show about you
saying it's a show? Because dumb.

07:42.712 --> 07:43.712
You're dumb.

07:43.922 --> 07:44.922
Go in the back.

07:45.048 --> 07:46.408
Go in the back
and sit by yourself.

07:46.633 --> 07:47.926
Jeff! PELTON:
What are you doing?

07:48.218 --> 07:49.218
What is wrong with you?

07:49.469 --> 07:50.971
I'm sick of it. It's a show.

07:51.262 --> 07:53.062
It's not a show. It's your show.
It's my show.

07:53.098 --> 07:55.392
It's a good show. It's a bad show.
I am sick of it.

07:55.684 --> 07:57.477
I don't want to hear
the word show again.

07:57.769 --> 08:00.522
Show, show, show. Is it a show?
Show, show?

08:00.814 --> 08:03.233
So, now it's a show about this?

08:03.525 --> 08:05.503
Oh, you're right. That's way worse.
Abed, come back.

08:05.527 --> 08:06.736
Yes. PELTON: Abed, some back.

08:07.028 --> 08:08.738
I'm not sorry. It's
not good to be back.

08:09.030 --> 08:11.282
What the hell was that?

08:11.574 --> 08:12.909
The battery is dead.

08:13.201 --> 08:14.201
Oh. Flooded?

08:14.411 --> 08:15.954
Winger, so help me God.

08:16.246 --> 08:18.206
The RV has two batteries,
a primary

08:18.498 --> 08:20.166
- and a secondary...
- Secondary.

08:22.627 --> 08:24.045
We overloaded
the electrical system

08:24.337 --> 08:25.523
and killed the engine battery.

08:25.547 --> 08:26.756
So, now the secondary battery

08:27.048 --> 08:28.609
has maybe three
or four hours of juice...

08:28.633 --> 08:30.343
Charge. Juice charge.

08:32.303 --> 08:33.596
And we have a choice to make.

08:33.888 --> 08:36.433
And Jeff can explain that choice.
Oh, it's your RV.

08:36.725 --> 08:38.660
This is my show. You didn't
give a damn about that.

08:38.684 --> 08:40.102
Abed, we're all on your side.

08:40.395 --> 08:43.690
So, if you're also
on your side, it's petty.

08:43.982 --> 08:45.902
We could wait for a
couple of hours and hope that

08:46.067 --> 08:47.694
the engine battery
resets itself.

08:47.986 --> 08:49.863
If it doesn't, we're
spending the night here.

08:50.155 --> 08:51.795
And at least we have
the secondary battery

08:51.865 --> 08:53.408
to keep us warm for a few hours.

08:53.700 --> 08:56.137
No, no, no, we're not spending the night
here. So what's the second option?

08:56.161 --> 08:59.039
Which I am nicknaming
"lil' course of action."

08:59.330 --> 09:01.374
I rewire the secondary battery
to the engine

09:01.666 --> 09:03.209
and hope it can start it.

09:03.501 --> 09:05.341
If it doesn't, we're
spending a very cold night

09:05.587 --> 09:06.796
with two dead batteries.

09:07.088 --> 09:09.208
Okay, let's switch the batteries then.
Good democracy.

09:09.340 --> 09:11.718
Are we sure the secondary
battery won't just die, too?

09:12.010 --> 09:13.511
It's a possibility.

09:13.803 --> 09:14.888
It exists.

09:15.180 --> 09:17.199
But I'm pretty confident
because the secondary battery

09:17.223 --> 09:18.683
only powers the cabin.

09:18.975 --> 09:20.226
And we've kept the lights off,

09:20.518 --> 09:21.686
and it goes without saying

09:21.978 --> 09:24.439
that we've all learned
to stop charging our phones.

09:29.444 --> 09:31.324
Why are you all looking
at each other like that?

09:31.488 --> 09:33.948
And where are each
of your phones, now?

09:38.787 --> 09:41.498
You know, I'm starting
to suspect the unthinkable.

09:41.790 --> 09:44.292
Namely that in spite
of all we've experienced,

09:44.584 --> 09:47.420
there's a cartoonish, vampiric
orgy of personal devices

09:47.712 --> 09:50.673
somewhere in the RV sucking
away our remaining battery.

09:50.965 --> 09:52.634
I only draw limited comfort

09:52.926 --> 09:55.637
from the fact that nobody's
running to unplug anything.

09:55.929 --> 09:57.430
But you know what?

09:58.681 --> 10:00.308
Say nothing.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.894
I'll just...

10:03.186 --> 10:05.855
turn the light switch
to the on position.

10:20.078 --> 10:21.996
There is a bright side to this.

10:22.288 --> 10:25.667
Most conventional weapons
don't require electricity.

10:27.502 --> 10:29.712
Are you going to eat me first?

10:38.096 --> 10:40.473
Hear those crickets?

10:40.765 --> 10:42.045
This would be
a challenging place

10:42.100 --> 10:43.810
to practice your stand-up act.

10:45.770 --> 10:49.232
So, I rented Hotel Rwanda the other
night, and let me just say...

10:49.524 --> 10:50.984
not a date movie.

10:53.862 --> 10:56.239
What would Arnold
Schwarzenegger sound like

10:56.531 --> 10:58.366
if he was bit by Dracula?

11:01.035 --> 11:02.537
All in favor?

11:02.829 --> 11:04.914
Then that solves the matter
of the giant hand.

11:05.206 --> 11:06.624
If there's no other business...

11:06.916 --> 11:08.310
If we're doing this, I'd like
to re-state the importance

11:08.334 --> 11:09.562
of telling some of this story
with flashback.

11:09.586 --> 11:10.837
What do you mean by re-state?

11:11.129 --> 11:13.298
Oh, my God, I fell for it.
Meeting adjourned.

11:16.885 --> 11:18.178
Why do we call them elbows?

11:18.469 --> 11:19.971
Why not arm knees?

11:22.348 --> 11:24.934
Man, I am dying up here.

11:25.226 --> 11:28.438
I'm scaling the blanket rations
inversely to the wattage

11:28.730 --> 11:30.523
of each person's phone.

11:30.815 --> 11:33.335
That way the person who killed us
the most will die the soonest.

11:33.526 --> 11:34.652
Which feels fair,

11:34.944 --> 11:36.279
right, Britta?

11:40.366 --> 11:42.911
I can't go all night
being this angry.

11:44.287 --> 11:46.247
Heart attacks run in my family,

11:46.539 --> 11:48.833
and you people aren't worth it.

11:49.125 --> 11:50.710
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

11:51.002 --> 11:54.005
I caused the situation
by not topping off the tank.

11:54.297 --> 11:56.382
And that vinyl accordion
partition...

11:56.674 --> 11:58.426
is a totem of distrust.

11:58.718 --> 11:59.886
I'm sorry for that, too. Aw.

12:00.178 --> 12:02.347
Elroy, that's big of you.

12:02.639 --> 12:03.799
And for our part, we're sorry

12:04.015 --> 12:05.815
that charging our
perfectly normal cell phones

12:06.017 --> 12:07.936
destroyed your weirdly
fragile RV.

12:09.062 --> 12:11.022
Okay, I'm sorry
about that apology.

12:11.314 --> 12:13.107
I'll try to be
a better house guest.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.819
No.

12:17.111 --> 12:18.321
Sorry I've been unavailable.

12:18.613 --> 12:20.453
I've been trying to cut to
three weeks earlier.

12:20.573 --> 12:21.973
It really feels
like we needed that.

12:22.242 --> 12:23.993
I have something
to apologize for, as well.

12:24.285 --> 12:25.578
Perhaps you recall earlier

12:25.870 --> 12:28.248
when it seemed as though we
drove through a skunk patch.

12:28.539 --> 12:30.142
Yeah, you were getting high.
Yeah, you were smoking pot.

12:30.166 --> 12:31.435
- Yeah, you were getting high.
- Getting stoned.

12:31.459 --> 12:33.253
Oh, okay, I remember thinking,

12:33.544 --> 12:35.421
I really pulled that one off.

12:35.713 --> 12:37.233
You thought that
because you were high.

12:37.257 --> 12:38.734
You also thought that
we were speeding

12:38.758 --> 12:41.386
'cause you kept seeing
the same bird.

12:47.600 --> 12:48.851
All in favor?

12:49.143 --> 12:51.312
Then that solves the matter
of the giant hand.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.273
If there's no other business...

12:53.564 --> 12:55.584
Let me just explain the need for a
flashback here, and don't interrupt.

12:55.608 --> 12:58.328
Okay, one quick thing and then you
can talk about flashbacks forever.

12:58.403 --> 12:59.487
Meeting adjourned.

12:59.779 --> 13:02.490
Abed, when they cut to
three weeks earlier on TV,

13:02.782 --> 13:04.659
they're not traveling
in time, dip-ass. Jeff.

13:04.951 --> 13:07.036
Okay, my apology now.

13:07.328 --> 13:08.768
I've had some time
to think about it,

13:08.997 --> 13:10.498
and I've decided...

13:10.790 --> 13:12.393
I'm sorry for not asking
people what they wanted

13:12.417 --> 13:14.057
before buying all the
snacks for the trip.

13:14.210 --> 13:15.920
Wow, really? That's great.

13:16.212 --> 13:17.212
What? Think about it.

13:17.380 --> 13:19.100
It's the worst thing
I've done on this trip.

13:19.257 --> 13:20.925
I've been nailing it.

13:21.217 --> 13:22.302
She has.

13:22.593 --> 13:23.636
You have.

13:23.928 --> 13:25.722
I haven't been.

13:26.014 --> 13:28.454
And I shouldn't be yelling at the
Dean in front of any of you.

13:28.683 --> 13:30.018
It's unprofessional.

13:30.310 --> 13:32.812
Ah, you're all right, Frankie.
We got no complaints.

13:42.196 --> 13:44.449
I forgive all of you.

13:50.913 --> 13:51.998
What?

13:54.000 --> 13:55.519
Then that solves the matter
of the giant hand.

13:55.543 --> 13:56.729
If there's no other business...

13:56.753 --> 13:58.230
In a normal road trip story
the first act

13:58.254 --> 13:59.857
would end with us
deciding to go on the trip,

13:59.881 --> 14:01.108
the second act would be the
trip ending with a disaster,

14:01.132 --> 14:02.359
and the third act
would be us getting back.

14:02.383 --> 14:03.444
The problem is,
we've already decided

14:03.468 --> 14:04.748
to take this trip
weeks from now.

14:05.011 --> 14:06.488
Which means the story starts
with us already on the road.

14:06.512 --> 14:08.407
Which means the end of act one
won't be us going on the trip.

14:08.431 --> 14:09.631
It'll have to be the disaster.

14:09.807 --> 14:11.577
Which means something even worse
has to happen in act two.

14:11.601 --> 14:13.041
Unless we make the decision
right now

14:13.227 --> 14:14.520
that act one is a flashback

14:14.812 --> 14:17.815
so that the beginning of the
story is now instead of then.

14:24.280 --> 14:25.740
You forgive us?

14:26.032 --> 14:27.367
Absolutely.

14:27.658 --> 14:29.410
You turd.

14:29.702 --> 14:30.828
I beg your pardon?

14:31.120 --> 14:32.760
Guys? You have no sense
of accountability.

14:32.830 --> 14:33.831
You're like a child.

14:34.123 --> 14:35.843
Well, if I'm a child,
you're a child abuser.

14:36.084 --> 14:37.377
Nuh-uh, not cool, Annie.

14:37.668 --> 14:40.004
You never just said
leave my hand where it is.

14:40.296 --> 14:42.757
I like it there.
I demand it stay.

14:43.049 --> 14:44.489
Because everyone
complained about it.

14:44.592 --> 14:46.392
Well, where's that commitment
to spinelessness

14:46.677 --> 14:48.397
when we're all admitting
we did stuff wrong?

14:48.513 --> 14:49.722
Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

14:50.014 --> 14:51.265
I'm a bad Dean, okay?

14:51.557 --> 14:53.660
No, that's what you always do.
That's not a real apology.

14:53.684 --> 14:55.311
Um, Jeff. Abed, shut up.
Go flashback

14:55.603 --> 14:56.729
and cut to stuff.

14:57.021 --> 14:58.941
And you, say you're sorry
for buying a giant hand

14:59.190 --> 15:01.085
and letting it sit around
until we had to deal with it.

15:01.109 --> 15:02.429
- And say it without crying.
- No!

15:02.652 --> 15:03.820
I'm an adult!

15:04.112 --> 15:05.988
And you can't make me not cry.

15:06.280 --> 15:07.480
You're all a bunch of bullies.

15:07.698 --> 15:09.409
And I will say I'm sorry
however I want.

15:09.700 --> 15:10.701
And by the way...

15:10.993 --> 15:12.453
I'm not sorry.

15:12.745 --> 15:16.249
It's my giant hand, and I love it!
We're not selling it!

15:18.584 --> 15:19.895
Okay, this is like crate-training a puppy.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.519
Everyone suppress
every instinct you have

15:21.712 --> 15:23.272
to let him out
and sleep in bed with us.

15:23.714 --> 15:25.633
Cold.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.165
No, I mean it's cold in the RV.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.107
I don't care how we
treat the Dean tonight.

15:31.264 --> 15:32.473
Abed, don't go after...

15:41.649 --> 15:44.819
Did they send you out here
to be mean to me, too?

15:46.320 --> 15:47.321
No. Good.

15:47.613 --> 15:48.693
Because I can't cry anymore

15:48.865 --> 15:51.200
unless someone
brings me a Pedialyte.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.003
Here.

16:03.629 --> 16:04.672
Here.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.432
Pretty comforting, huh?

16:14.724 --> 16:16.524
We could've put it outside
the art department.

16:16.684 --> 16:18.019
Or biology.

16:18.311 --> 16:20.521
Or woodworking if we removed
one of the fingers.

16:20.813 --> 16:23.213
You don't belong up here. It's
not right that you're up here.

16:23.274 --> 16:25.860
You get it don't you, Abed?

16:26.152 --> 16:27.752
You know what's important
about the hand.

16:28.029 --> 16:29.614
No, I know what's important
about story

16:29.906 --> 16:31.133
and I know we're structurally
overdue for a disaster.

16:31.157 --> 16:32.575
Oh, great.

16:32.867 --> 16:34.452
Figures, the one person
on my side

16:34.744 --> 16:36.954
is the one playing people chess.

16:37.246 --> 16:39.207
Don't move. Don't move.

16:39.499 --> 16:41.125
What the hell else
are we supposed to do?

16:41.417 --> 16:42.418
Flashback with me. What?

16:42.710 --> 16:43.990
Just trust me. I set a flashback

16:44.212 --> 16:46.092
three weeks earlier.
It's how this story begins.

16:46.130 --> 16:48.341
Close your eyes and concentrate.

16:52.595 --> 16:54.355
And that solves
the matter of the giant hand.

16:54.388 --> 16:55.628
If there's no other business...

16:55.848 --> 16:57.618
- Oh, there's some business.
- Yeah, there's business.

16:57.642 --> 16:58.869
When we tie the hand
to the roof,

16:58.893 --> 17:01.354
we'd like you to use
extra thick straps, please.

17:01.646 --> 17:02.647
Extra thick.

17:02.939 --> 17:04.179
Extra thick straps! Reinforced.

17:04.357 --> 17:05.757
All right,
meeting adjourned, great.

17:08.861 --> 17:09.987
Extra thick straps.

17:10.279 --> 17:11.864
Extra thick straps.

17:12.156 --> 17:13.866
Extra thick straps.

17:14.157 --> 17:15.409
Extra thick straps.

17:15.701 --> 17:16.786
There, that should do it.

17:17.078 --> 17:18.162
What should do it?

17:18.454 --> 17:20.182
We made sure the straps
were extra thick, remember?

17:20.205 --> 17:22.006
No, I don't remember
because it didn't happen.

17:22.083 --> 17:23.334
It didn't?

17:25.627 --> 17:27.171
What?

17:27.463 --> 17:29.715
Did something just
fall off the roof?

17:30.007 --> 17:31.759
That's a really stupid
question, Annie.

17:32.051 --> 17:35.054
Obviously something fell off the roof.
The question is what?

17:43.271 --> 17:44.981
Abed, where's the Dean?

17:46.232 --> 17:47.316
Oh, damn, come on.

17:50.528 --> 17:51.821
Okay. One, two, three.

17:52.113 --> 17:53.489
Carefully, carefully!

17:53.781 --> 17:56.284
How do you lift a giant hand
off a person haphazardly?

17:56.576 --> 17:57.576
You know what, Annie! No!

17:57.660 --> 17:59.203
Sorry. Dean, hang on.

17:59.495 --> 18:01.622
Dean, we're so sorry.
We love you.

18:05.251 --> 18:06.669
- Screw you!
- What?

18:06.961 --> 18:07.961
Hey, that's my house.

18:08.212 --> 18:10.590
We are not sorry. We hate you!

18:10.881 --> 18:11.942
Are we gonna freeze to death?

18:11.966 --> 18:13.009
I call the hand.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.930
The fiber glass
will preserve body heat.

18:20.891 --> 18:22.727
What's wrong with me
if that's hot?

18:27.273 --> 18:29.692
Dean, these temperatures are
lowering our immune systems

18:29.984 --> 18:33.487
in a world that's swarming with weird
people's unvaccinated toddlers!

18:33.779 --> 18:34.989
Deal with it.

18:35.281 --> 18:36.550
I'm gonna go
around to the other side

18:36.574 --> 18:38.117
to see if he's locked
that door, too.

18:38.409 --> 18:40.786
It probably undercuts my goals
to announce them out loud.

18:41.078 --> 18:42.622
But I'm a verbal thinker.

18:42.913 --> 18:45.458
I'm not even sure I have
an idea until I say it.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.502
They should make hiking boots

18:48.794 --> 18:49.920
with a compass in the toe.

18:50.212 --> 18:52.131
Go! But don't you...

18:52.423 --> 18:55.843
Dean, we're sorry
and we love you?

18:56.135 --> 18:58.721
Nice uncontrollable
question mark, Britta.

18:59.013 --> 19:00.306
You can't even fake it?

19:00.598 --> 19:03.100
Dean, we're sorry
and we love you.

19:03.392 --> 19:04.852
Super realistic, Annie.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.313
You're a real sociopath.

19:07.605 --> 19:10.316
I saw all your true colors
when the chips were down.

19:10.608 --> 19:12.234
Abed's the only human among you.

19:12.526 --> 19:14.206
And I think we all know
how ironic that is.

19:14.320 --> 19:15.946
No offense, Abed. None possible.

19:16.238 --> 19:17.238
Abed.

19:17.448 --> 19:19.575
You bonded with him.
Talk to him.

19:19.867 --> 19:21.027
You're alone in the end zone.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.787
This ball is yours or nobody's.

19:23.079 --> 19:24.999
I appreciate your appeal
to my well-known passion

19:25.247 --> 19:26.832
for athletics and sarcasm.

19:27.124 --> 19:28.977
But I didn't actually bond with him.
I almost killed him.

19:29.001 --> 19:31.253
My naive obsession with
contrived flashback technique

19:31.545 --> 19:32.773
has kept me from being invested

19:32.797 --> 19:33.917
in any of this actual story.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.173
I mean, what was it even?

19:35.299 --> 19:36.425
A bunch of people in an RV?

19:36.717 --> 19:38.037
And I had to
Christopher Nolan it?

19:38.135 --> 19:39.135
Well, there you go.

19:39.345 --> 19:40.465
Now you can forget all about

19:40.680 --> 19:43.849
stupid three weeks earlier
flashbacks and be a hero

19:44.141 --> 19:46.018
by joining us here,
in the moment.

19:46.310 --> 19:48.688
And talking to the Dean
like a human.

19:48.979 --> 19:50.523
That's my arc. That's your arc.

19:52.358 --> 19:53.984
Okay, here we go.

19:57.279 --> 19:58.989
If there's no other business...

19:59.281 --> 20:00.842
I'd like to propose a heavy use
of flashback in this episode.

20:00.866 --> 20:02.952
No, Abed, don't do it.
Thanks, Abed!

20:03.244 --> 20:04.245
Stop that!

20:04.537 --> 20:05.746
Get your head out of your ass.

20:06.038 --> 20:07.099
I don't know how. I'm
over-saturated with the gimmick.

20:07.123 --> 20:08.558
I... I don't know
what's real. I don't...

20:08.582 --> 20:10.626
You are lying. You have to be lying.
You enjoy this.

20:10.918 --> 20:12.837
Stop it.
What has gotten into you?

20:13.129 --> 20:14.964
Why are you shocked
that he's alienated?

20:15.256 --> 20:17.550
You get him to do something
normal without abusing him.

20:18.217 --> 20:19.260
Abed, listen.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.262
This is a flashback, remember?

20:21.554 --> 20:23.889
The real story is
happening in the future.

20:24.181 --> 20:27.268
You actually flashed back
to now to help us.

20:28.519 --> 20:29.599
Okay, that was pretty good.

20:35.067 --> 20:38.821
So sad what happened here,
all those centons ago.

20:39.113 --> 20:40.990
So sad. So preventable.

20:41.282 --> 20:43.576
Space elder, Abed, can you
reach backward with your mind

20:43.868 --> 20:45.286
and save our species?

20:45.578 --> 20:47.621
I can.

20:47.913 --> 20:49.665
I'm space elder Britta.

20:55.171 --> 20:56.714
What are you guys talking about?

21:04.805 --> 21:06.265
I'm here now, child.

21:06.557 --> 21:07.557
All will be made right.

21:10.311 --> 21:11.896
Dean? PELTON: Abed?

21:12.188 --> 21:15.107
I have discovered the
meaning of the giant hand.

21:15.399 --> 21:18.819
A hand has two
functions, to grip and to release.

21:19.111 --> 21:22.448
But without both of these
powers, it is useless.

21:22.740 --> 21:24.620
Like newborn infants,
we grab what comes near us

21:25.409 --> 21:27.453
hoping to control it, taste it,

21:27.745 --> 21:30.372
jam it into another child's eye.

21:30.664 --> 21:34.210
But the time we spend
in control of our world

21:34.502 --> 21:36.253
is the time we spend
letting go of others.

21:37.129 --> 21:39.256
Ideas, stories, pride,

21:39.548 --> 21:42.259
girls in soft sweaters, video
games, buttered noodles.

21:42.551 --> 21:43.886
Grip one for too long

21:44.178 --> 21:46.514
and you lose so much
that you've never held.

21:50.100 --> 21:52.436
This giant hand
was sent to all of us

21:52.728 --> 21:53.729
as an invitation

21:54.021 --> 21:57.024
to increase our mastery
over the power to hold on.

21:58.442 --> 21:59.735
And let go.

22:08.244 --> 22:09.411
Sorry.

22:10.496 --> 22:12.122
Oh, Dean.

22:12.414 --> 22:13.666
Dummy.

22:25.636 --> 22:27.304
The doors were locked
on that side, too.

22:28.597 --> 22:29.890
Took you long enough.

22:30.182 --> 22:32.643
I'd be lying
if I said I didn't poop.

22:33.561 --> 22:35.271
Could you lie, then?

22:35.563 --> 22:36.897
Sure I can.

22:37.189 --> 22:39.316
Sure I can.

22:40.860 --> 22:42.152
I slapped you, man.

22:55.291 --> 22:56.959
Where were you?

22:57.251 --> 23:00.379
The reason why I'm covered
in feathers is because...

23:12.892 --> 23:14.476
Hi, this is Blake,

23:14.768 --> 23:17.062
the gentleman to whom you're
selling the giant hand.

23:17.354 --> 23:21.734
I am calling to confirm that
you have the correct address.

23:22.026 --> 23:24.153
We live at the end
of a long driveway

23:24.445 --> 23:28.198
which often gets confused
with a road.

23:28.490 --> 23:30.242
Anyway, it's been many hours

23:30.534 --> 23:32.828
since our scheduled
appointment time.

23:33.120 --> 23:36.457
Again, it's Blake with a B.

23:36.749 --> 23:38.918
The purchaser of the giant hand.

23:39.793 --> 23:40.793
Bye.

23:57.895 --> 23:59.055
They're not coming, are they?

23:59.271 --> 24:00.856
I don't know, Karen.
I left a message.

24:01.148 --> 24:02.308
What are you gonna do when...

24:02.441 --> 24:04.652
What am I gonna do
with the giant watch?

24:04.944 --> 24:07.780
I don't know.
I... I don't plan for failure.

24:08.072 --> 24:09.782
Have you tried
planning for success?

24:10.074 --> 24:13.452
Does everything you do
to this family have...

24:13.744 --> 24:16.080
No, finish your thought.

24:16.372 --> 24:17.498
Finish your thought.

24:17.790 --> 24:21.293
Does everything have to do
with me purchasing

24:21.585 --> 24:23.879
over-sized items
on the internet?

24:24.171 --> 24:25.815
But that's not what this
is really about, is it?

24:25.839 --> 24:28.842
It's not about a giant
hand or a giant watch.

24:29.134 --> 24:32.388
Please, don't. It's about
a normal-sized son

24:32.680 --> 24:34.306
who disappeared,

24:34.598 --> 24:36.684
and it's all my fault

24:36.976 --> 24:39.853
because I gave him a giant kite!

24:41.480 --> 24:44.149
Yes! How could you
not make that connection?

24:44.441 --> 24:47.069
Why do you continue to buy
giant-sized versions

24:47.361 --> 24:48.487
of everyday objects

24:48.779 --> 24:50.948
when they are the reason
our son is dead?

24:51.240 --> 24:52.240
Disappeared!

24:52.408 --> 24:53.408
Disappeared.

24:53.534 --> 24:55.452
They never found his body
on the ground,

24:55.744 --> 24:57.384
which proves
he's still up there, waiting.

24:57.538 --> 25:00.082
He's waiting for a better daddy,

25:00.374 --> 25:02.501
with a bigger hand.

25:05.212 --> 25:06.547
Oh.

25:08.716 --> 25:09.842
Really?

25:11.010 --> 25:13.512
So, then why the watch?

25:13.804 --> 25:15.681
I thought
it would look really cool.

25:15.973 --> 25:17.766
I'm gonna walk the dog,

25:18.058 --> 25:19.893
and eventually leave you.

25:21.061 --> 25:23.397
I'll put the watch
in the garage.

25:24.898 --> 25:27.192
And probably stop showering.
