( horn honks )

01:04.989 --> 01:05.590
( screams )

01:22.030 --> 01:23.600
Busted my hump all week.

01:23.660 --> 01:24.760
Stupid grass!

01:24.830 --> 01:26.840
Supposed to be
the boy's job.

01:26.900 --> 01:28.140
Now, now, Homer

01:28.200 --> 01:31.340
Bart's busy working
on his science project.

01:31.400 --> 01:32.530
You heard the lady, Homer

01:32.600 --> 01:33.930
so please mow quietly.

01:34.010 --> 01:35.740
Genius at work.

01:39.010 --> 01:41.620
1:00, still just a potato.

01:43.350 --> 01:44.720
Hey there, neighbor.

01:44.780 --> 01:48.110
The Lord's certainly given us
a beautiful day today, huh?

01:48.190 --> 01:49.190
Hello, Flanders.

01:49.250 --> 01:50.720
Doing a little
yard work, huh?

01:50.790 --> 01:51.960
Who told?

01:52.020 --> 01:53.350
Marge, beer me.

01:53.430 --> 01:54.830
Say, Simpson

01:54.890 --> 01:57.020
I've got some
time-released granules

01:57.100 --> 02:00.300
that will get rid of that
crabgrass in just half a jiff.

02:00.370 --> 02:01.370
Crabgrass?

02:01.430 --> 02:03.090
What are you
talking about?

02:03.170 --> 02:04.240
Where?

02:04.300 --> 02:05.630
Well, there...

02:05.700 --> 02:08.100
and there's
a big patch over there.

02:08.169 --> 02:10.470
There's nothing wrong
with crabgrass.

02:10.539 --> 02:12.000
It just has a bad name,
that's all.

02:12.080 --> 02:13.580
Everyone would love it

02:13.650 --> 02:16.080
if it had a cute name
like "elfgrass."

02:16.150 --> 02:18.050
Well, you may be right.

02:18.120 --> 02:19.420
Marge, where's the Duff?

02:19.490 --> 02:21.290
Oh, we're all out, Homer.

02:21.350 --> 02:22.150
D-ohhh!

02:22.220 --> 02:23.520
Would you like some fruit juice?

02:23.590 --> 02:25.390
Don't toy with me, woman.

02:25.460 --> 02:28.000
I couldn't help
overhearing, Simpson.

02:28.060 --> 02:30.900
I've got some ice-cold suds
in the rumpus room

02:30.960 --> 02:32.090
if you'd like
to join me.

02:32.160 --> 02:34.260
Well uh, okay, what the heck?

02:34.330 --> 02:36.330
I've earned a little break.

02:37.540 --> 02:39.270
( gasps ) Holy moley.

02:39.340 --> 02:41.110
It's beautiful.

02:41.170 --> 02:42.530
Say, that's right.

02:42.610 --> 02:45.950
This is your first visit
to the Flanders homestead.

02:46.010 --> 02:47.920
Well, we've
only been neighbors...

02:47.980 --> 02:49.480
what?

02:49.550 --> 02:50.850
Eight years.

02:50.920 --> 02:52.890
There's my little
popcorn ball.

02:52.950 --> 02:53.890
Kissy-kissy.

02:53.950 --> 02:55.480
Oh, hello, sponge cake.

02:55.550 --> 02:57.880
I thought you boys
might be hungry

02:57.960 --> 02:59.660
so I whipped up
some club sandwiches.

02:59.730 --> 03:01.860
Ain't she wonderful, Simpson?

03:01.930 --> 03:03.830
Yeah yeah yeah, but aren't we
forgetting something, Flanders?

03:03.900 --> 03:05.070
Oh, your beer.

03:05.130 --> 03:06.370
Is draft okay?

03:06.430 --> 03:08.900
Just put in the tap
last week.

03:11.140 --> 03:13.240
Here's a tasty little lager

03:13.310 --> 03:15.140
that came all the way
from Holland.

03:15.210 --> 03:18.780
Well, beggars
can't be choosy.

03:18.840 --> 03:19.670
( <i>burp )</i>

03:19.750 --> 03:21.120
Hey Dad, thanks for helping me

03:21.180 --> 03:22.820
with my science project.

03:22.880 --> 03:25.090
Mwah!
Oh, my pleasure,
study buddy.

03:25.150 --> 03:27.690
I got the best Dad
in the whole world.

03:27.750 --> 03:30.520
You know how
that embarrasses me.

03:30.590 --> 03:31.560
I know.

03:31.620 --> 03:33.050
Toodley-doodley.

03:33.130 --> 03:35.260
Kids can be
a trial sometimes.

03:35.330 --> 03:37.230
All right,
knock it off!

03:37.300 --> 03:39.000
Knock what off, Simpson?

03:39.060 --> 03:42.260
You've been rubbing
my nose in it since I got here!

03:42.330 --> 03:44.660
Your family is better
than my family!

03:44.740 --> 03:47.580
Your beer comes
from farther away than my beer!

03:47.640 --> 03:49.180
<i>You and your son
like each other!</i>

03:49.240 --> 03:52.980
Your wife's butt is higher
than my wife's butt.

03:53.050 --> 03:54.120
You make me sick!

03:54.180 --> 03:55.450
Simpson, I'm afraid

03:55.510 --> 03:57.810
I'm going to have
to ask you to leave.

03:57.880 --> 03:59.310
I hope you understand.

03:59.380 --> 04:01.480
I wouldn't stay on a bet!

04:04.620 --> 04:05.780
One for the road.

04:09.330 --> 04:10.600
( <i>moaning )</i>

04:10.660 --> 04:12.890
Homey, quit tossing.

04:12.970 --> 04:14.100
Sorry, Marge.

04:14.170 --> 04:16.440
But it's just that
I'm still steamed up

04:16.500 --> 04:18.370
about that jerk Flanders.

04:18.440 --> 04:20.410
Lousy, bragging
know-it-all, show-off.

04:20.470 --> 04:22.300
What exactly did he say?

04:22.370 --> 04:23.300
Get this.

04:23.380 --> 04:24.310
He said...

04:24.380 --> 04:25.480
No, he said...

04:25.540 --> 04:28.040
It wasn't so much
what he said

04:28.110 --> 04:29.710
it was how he said it.

04:29.780 --> 04:31.220
How did he say it?

04:31.280 --> 04:32.710
Well, he...

04:32.780 --> 04:33.480
Was he angry?

04:33.550 --> 04:34.120
No.

04:34.190 --> 04:35.320
Was he rude?

04:35.390 --> 04:37.460
Okay, okay.
It wasn't how he said it either,

04:37.520 --> 04:39.850
but the message
was loud and clear.

04:39.930 --> 04:41.130
Our family stinks!

04:41.190 --> 04:43.150
Homer, I'm your best friend

04:43.230 --> 04:47.270
but I've gotta say,
I've never seen him be
anything but a perfect neighbor.

04:47.330 --> 04:49.490
Oh, he's perfect now, is he?

04:49.570 --> 04:52.510
Well, he's not perfect,
but he is very...

04:52.570 --> 04:53.880
No no Marge, don't backpedal!

04:53.940 --> 04:55.780
You were right the first time.

04:55.840 --> 04:56.780
He's perfect!

04:56.840 --> 04:59.550
Perfect in every way.

04:59.610 --> 05:01.750
I'm just gonna go take a walk
around the block to calm down.

05:01.810 --> 05:02.970
I got a little excited.

05:03.050 --> 05:04.590
I'm not perfect...

05:04.650 --> 05:06.120
like Ned Flanders.

05:07.350 --> 05:08.910
( door slams )
Oh, no.

05:15.760 --> 05:17.030
Neddy, you're tossing.

05:17.100 --> 05:20.070
What's the matter?

05:20.130 --> 05:21.170
I feel terrible.

05:21.230 --> 05:22.660
Sometimes I forget

05:22.730 --> 05:25.530
that we have things
a little better
than the Simpsons.

05:25.600 --> 05:27.830
I drag him over here,
he has a few beers.

05:27.910 --> 05:29.410
You can't blame him
for erupting and then..

05:29.470 --> 05:33.040
I turn into a snarling beast.

05:33.110 --> 05:35.480
Talk about flunking the old
turn-the-other-cheek test.

05:35.550 --> 05:39.350
Well Ned, maybe I'm not the one
you should be talking to.

05:39.420 --> 05:40.620
You're right.

05:43.920 --> 05:44.950
Hello, Reverend Lovejoy?

05:45.020 --> 05:48.690
No, this is Mrs. Lovejoy.

05:48.760 --> 05:50.030
Just a minute.

05:50.100 --> 05:52.430
Honey, honey, wake up.

05:52.500 --> 05:56.200
It sounds like Ned Flanders
is having some sort of crisis.

05:56.270 --> 05:58.310
Oh, probably stepped
on a worm.

06:00.010 --> 06:01.410
Hello, Ned.

06:01.470 --> 06:03.630
Reverend, I'm sorry
to bother you at this hour

06:03.710 --> 06:06.780
but I threw a man
out of my house today.

06:06.850 --> 06:09.320
I feel like I violated
Matthew 19:19.

06:09.380 --> 06:10.490
Huh?

06:10.550 --> 06:11.650
"Love thy neighbor."

06:11.720 --> 06:13.120
Oh, oh.

06:13.190 --> 06:14.990
Matthew 19:19, right.

06:15.050 --> 06:18.150
Well, you know, Ned,
the good book says

06:18.220 --> 06:20.320
"A gentle answer
turneth away wrath."

06:20.390 --> 06:21.630
A gentle answer?

06:21.690 --> 06:23.650
Well, that is a jim-dandy idea.

06:23.730 --> 06:25.900
Bless you, Reverend.

06:27.870 --> 06:30.440
"Dear neighbor..."

06:34.570 --> 06:35.930
<i>Flanders!
Ah!</i>

06:36.010 --> 06:38.180
I don't blame you
for being upset with me, Homer.

06:38.240 --> 06:40.470
I just wanted to give you
this letter.

06:40.550 --> 06:41.480
I'll leave now.

06:41.550 --> 06:43.150
"Dear neighbor...

06:48.350 --> 06:50.550
"...You are my brother.

06:50.620 --> 06:52.080
"I love you.

06:54.830 --> 06:58.700
"...and yet I feel
a great sadness

06:58.760 --> 07:00.290
in my bosom."

07:03.440 --> 07:04.610
Bosom.

07:04.670 --> 07:06.310
Wait, wait, there's more.

07:06.370 --> 07:07.710
I think that's terrible.

07:07.770 --> 07:11.200
A man opens his heart,
and you make fun of him.

07:13.050 --> 07:14.620
"...neighbors forever."

07:14.680 --> 07:17.020
Oh, no.

07:17.080 --> 07:19.320
"Ned Flanders."

07:19.380 --> 07:21.250
What a sap.

07:21.320 --> 07:23.790
Read the bosom part
again, Dad.

07:25.460 --> 07:27.300
Now just a minute!

07:27.360 --> 07:28.230
Bosom.

07:30.560 --> 07:32.120
Bart!

07:32.200 --> 07:34.940
I wish this family was
as close as the Flanders.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.140
Okay, all right.

07:36.200 --> 07:37.470
She's right.

07:37.540 --> 07:39.040
Let's do something together.

07:39.100 --> 07:42.070
What does everyone say
to some miniature golf

07:42.140 --> 07:45.310
followed by a round
of frosty chocolate milk shakes?

07:45.380 --> 07:46.580
All right.

07:46.650 --> 07:48.850
Hmm, I was going
to wash my hair.

07:48.910 --> 07:50.880
And I'm studying
for the math fair.

07:50.950 --> 07:53.620
If I win, I'll bring home
a brand new protractor.

07:53.690 --> 07:55.420
Too bad we don't live
on a farm.

07:55.490 --> 07:56.520
Let's go, boy.

08:01.760 --> 08:03.030
Fore!

08:08.630 --> 08:10.290
( <i>laughing )</i>

08:10.370 --> 08:12.810
But I got it in the middle.

08:15.570 --> 08:17.270
D-oh!
That was just
a practice shot, boy.

08:17.340 --> 08:19.200
Play where it lays, Homer.

08:34.490 --> 08:36.289
Hey, there's Homer Simpson.

08:36.360 --> 08:39.970
What a perfect opportunity
to follow up on my letter.

08:40.030 --> 08:42.100
Give up, homeboy.

08:42.169 --> 08:43.240
There's a six-stroke limit.

08:43.299 --> 08:46.070
I know. I can
still make this for five.

08:46.140 --> 08:49.280
Come on, baby, please,
please, go in, please.

08:53.350 --> 08:54.750
D-ohhh!
( grunting )

08:55.850 --> 08:57.220
Hi, Simpson.

08:57.280 --> 08:58.340
Having fun?

08:58.420 --> 09:00.350
Flanders,
what are you doing here?

09:00.420 --> 09:02.760
Just playing a little mini-golf
with the Todd-meister.

09:02.820 --> 09:04.530
Hi, Bart.
Get bent.

09:04.590 --> 09:07.430
Say, now that we're all friends
again, why don't we make a
foursome?

09:07.490 --> 09:08.650
That sounds great.

09:08.730 --> 09:10.360
All right. This will be fun.

09:10.430 --> 09:12.230
Say, you looked like
you were having a little
trouble there.

09:12.300 --> 09:14.100
That shot is impossible!

09:14.170 --> 09:15.840
Jack Nicholson himself
couldn't make it.

09:15.900 --> 09:17.310
It is difficult,
Mr. Simpson.

09:17.370 --> 09:19.870
The best strategy is to
play conservatively.

09:19.940 --> 09:21.440
Hug the rail.
It won't go in

09:21.510 --> 09:24.280
but you set yourself up
for an easy deuce.

09:26.110 --> 09:27.350
Oh, well.. hmm.

09:27.410 --> 09:28.440
It went in.

09:28.510 --> 09:29.440
Good shot, Toddski.

09:29.510 --> 09:30.640
Luck.

09:30.720 --> 09:32.990
Bart:
Final score, Bart 41

09:33.050 --> 09:34.420
Homer, let's see...

09:34.490 --> 09:37.690
Six plus six plus six
plus six plus six...

09:37.760 --> 09:38.460
Never mind.

09:38.520 --> 09:39.520
Hey, look.

09:39.590 --> 09:42.760
Wow! First prize, $50.

09:42.830 --> 09:45.470
Wow! Free balloons
for everyone who enters.

09:45.530 --> 09:47.800
So my little Bartly,
thinking of entering
the tournament?

09:47.870 --> 09:49.470
Yeah, he's entering

09:49.530 --> 09:51.530
and what's more, he's going
to win, aren't you, boy?

09:51.600 --> 09:52.730
I guess it's possible.

09:52.800 --> 09:54.630
Hey, I like that confidence.

09:54.710 --> 09:56.180
But I hope you're not
putting too much pressure
on the boy.

09:56.240 --> 09:57.850
My Todd's awfully good.

09:57.910 --> 09:59.110
Oh, yeah?

09:59.180 --> 10:01.450
I think the fruit
of my loins

10:01.510 --> 10:04.040
can beat the fruit of your loins
any day of the week.

10:04.120 --> 10:05.790
- Come on, boy.
- Hyuh!

10:05.850 --> 10:09.620
( Homer slurps loudly )
But Dad, I've never won
anything in my life.

10:09.690 --> 10:12.990
Son, this is the only time
I'm ever gonna say this.

10:13.060 --> 10:14.500
It is not okay to lose.

10:18.100 --> 10:21.840
Stay, stay. Good dog.

10:21.900 --> 10:23.500
Now, keep your head down.

10:23.570 --> 10:24.840
Not you.

10:24.900 --> 10:26.500
I'm talking to the boy.

10:26.570 --> 10:27.780
Keep your head down.

10:27.840 --> 10:29.340
Follow through.

10:30.910 --> 10:33.180
Okay, that didn't work.

10:33.250 --> 10:35.220
This time, move your head
and don't follow through.

10:35.280 --> 10:36.380
<i>Oh, man.</i>

10:36.450 --> 10:37.890
( <i>sighing )</i>

10:39.220 --> 10:41.460
What are you doing?!

10:41.520 --> 10:43.090
That putter is to you

10:43.150 --> 10:45.420
what a bat is
to a baseball player.

10:45.490 --> 10:48.900
What a violin is to the...
the guy... the violin guy.

10:48.960 --> 10:50.700
Now come on!
Give your putter a name.

10:50.760 --> 10:51.960
What?

10:52.030 --> 10:53.370
Come on. Give it a name.

10:53.430 --> 10:54.670
Mr. Putter.

10:54.730 --> 10:57.260
Oh! You want to try
a little harder, son?

10:57.340 --> 10:59.110
<i>C'mon, give it
a girl's name.</i>

10:59.170 --> 10:59.970
Mom.

11:00.040 --> 11:01.340
Your putter's name is Charlene.

11:01.410 --> 11:02.080
Why?

11:02.140 --> 11:03.880
It just is, that's why.

11:03.940 --> 11:06.750
Now this is a picture
of your enemy

11:06.810 --> 11:08.220
Todd Flanders.

11:08.280 --> 11:10.920
Every day, I want you
to spend 15 minutes

11:10.980 --> 11:13.180
staring at it
and concentrating

11:13.250 --> 11:14.820
on how much you hate him

11:14.890 --> 11:17.060
and how glorious it will be

11:17.120 --> 11:19.490
when you and Charlene
annihilate him.

11:19.560 --> 11:20.490
Who's Charlene?

11:20.560 --> 11:22.230
I'll show you

11:22.290 --> 11:22.920
who Charlene is.

11:22.990 --> 11:24.160
Now start hating.

11:24.230 --> 11:25.830
( <i>growling )</i>

11:30.700 --> 11:31.940
Hi, Bart.

11:34.810 --> 11:36.440
Homer, I couldn't help
overhearing you

11:36.510 --> 11:38.080
warp Bart's mind.

11:38.140 --> 11:39.370
And?

11:39.440 --> 11:41.210
I'm worried that you're making
too big a deal

11:41.280 --> 11:43.350
over this silly little
kiddie golf tournament.

11:43.420 --> 11:46.350
But Marge, this is our
big chance to show up
the Flanderses.

11:46.420 --> 11:47.690
I'm sure it is

11:47.750 --> 11:49.350
but why do we want to do that?

11:49.420 --> 11:52.090
Because sometimes the only way
you can feel good about yourself

11:52.160 --> 11:54.330
is by making
someone else look bad.

11:54.390 --> 11:57.320
And I'm tired of making
other people feel good
about themselves.

11:57.400 --> 11:58.130
Hmm.

12:02.700 --> 12:04.000
( <i>groans )</i>

12:04.070 --> 12:05.270
Hi, Bart.

12:05.340 --> 12:06.810
What are you doing?

12:06.870 --> 12:09.210
Lise, what do you call those
guys in chess that don't matter?

12:09.270 --> 12:11.640
Well, a black-headed bishop
is of little value

12:11.710 --> 12:13.980
but I think you're
referring to a pawn.

12:14.050 --> 12:15.350
Right.

12:15.410 --> 12:16.710
I am a pawn.

12:16.780 --> 12:19.490
I know. It's times like this
that I'm thankful

12:19.550 --> 12:22.920
Dad has little to no interest
in almost everything I do.

12:22.990 --> 12:25.290
Bart, I think I can help you.

12:25.360 --> 12:27.160
Lisa: Our journey begins here
at the library.

12:27.230 --> 12:28.530
Hi, Lisa.

12:28.590 --> 12:30.490
Hi, Mrs. Norton.

12:30.560 --> 12:31.600
Hi, Lisa.

12:31.660 --> 12:32.720
Hi, Ralph.

12:32.800 --> 12:34.070
Hi, Lisa.

12:34.130 --> 12:35.470
Hi, gang.

12:35.530 --> 12:38.260
Okay, Bart, this is
the card catalogue.

12:38.340 --> 12:39.940
Let's see. Golf.

12:40.010 --> 12:42.340
Anecdotes, Eisenhower and...

12:42.410 --> 12:45.610
profession, humor,
Japanese obsession with...

12:45.680 --> 12:46.980
Ah, here it is.

12:47.050 --> 12:47.950
Putting.

12:49.080 --> 12:50.380
And finally

12:50.450 --> 12:52.150
the most important book of all--

12:52.220 --> 12:54.090
The <i>Tao-Te Ching by Lao-Tzu.</i>

12:54.150 --> 12:56.220
Lisa, we can't afford
all these books.

12:56.290 --> 12:57.760
Bart, we're just
gonna borrow them.

12:57.820 --> 13:00.150
Oh. Gotcha.

13:00.230 --> 13:02.630
Lisa:
I want you to shut off the
logical part of your mind.

13:02.690 --> 13:03.590
Bart:
Okay.

13:03.660 --> 13:05.270
Embrace nothingness.

13:05.330 --> 13:06.670
You got it.

13:06.730 --> 13:08.400
Become like
an uncarved stone.

13:08.470 --> 13:10.040
Done.

13:10.100 --> 13:12.470
Bart! You're just pretending to
know what I'm talking about.

13:12.540 --> 13:14.240
- True.
- Well it's very frustrating.

13:14.310 --> 13:15.510
I'll bet.

13:15.570 --> 13:17.740
Bart, I have
a riddle for you.

13:17.810 --> 13:20.410
What's the sound
of one hand clapping?

13:20.480 --> 13:22.320
Piece of cake.

13:22.380 --> 13:25.650
No Bart, it's a 3,000-year-old
riddle with no answer.

13:25.720 --> 13:27.990
It supposed to clear your
mind of conscious thought.

13:28.050 --> 13:30.010
No answer?

13:30.090 --> 13:32.490
Lisa, listen up.

13:32.560 --> 13:34.660
Let's try another one.

13:34.730 --> 13:36.930
If a tree falls in
the woods, and no one's around

13:37.000 --> 13:38.430
does it make a sound?

13:38.500 --> 13:39.830
Absolutely.

13:39.900 --> 13:41.770
( <i>makes crashing noises )</i>

13:41.830 --> 13:44.030
But Bart, how can sound exist

13:44.100 --> 13:46.440
if there's no one there
to hear it?

13:48.170 --> 13:49.470
Whoo!

13:49.540 --> 13:51.810
It is time.

13:51.880 --> 13:54.780
The basis of this game
seems to be simple geometry.

13:54.850 --> 13:58.220
All you have to do
is hit the ball here.

14:04.490 --> 14:05.990
I can't believe it.

14:06.060 --> 14:08.330
You actually found a
practical use for geometry.

14:28.310 --> 14:30.210
Bart, what are you doing?

14:30.280 --> 14:32.290
Get down before
the neighbors see...

14:32.350 --> 14:33.920
- Hey, Simpson.
- D-oh!

14:33.990 --> 14:35.560
Flanders, I don't care
what this looks like.

14:35.620 --> 14:39.260
Bart's gonna mop the floor with
your son's ugly butt.

14:39.320 --> 14:40.850
Sir, may the best man win.

14:40.930 --> 14:42.930
"May the best man win."

14:42.990 --> 14:44.720
The mating call
of the loser.

14:44.800 --> 14:46.000
Just a minute, Simpson.

14:46.060 --> 14:47.960
I think my son has a <i>very good
chance.</i>

14:48.030 --> 14:49.260
Yeah? Want to bet?

14:49.330 --> 14:51.530
Yeah, well,
I'm not a betting man.

14:51.600 --> 14:52.800
( <i>clucking sounds )</i>

14:52.870 --> 14:54.580
Oh, I'm a chicken, am I?

14:54.640 --> 14:55.580
That's right.

14:55.640 --> 14:57.210
How's this for a wager?

14:57.280 --> 15:00.280
A batch of your wife's
delicious blueberry muffins

15:00.350 --> 15:03.220
against one of my wife's
homemade wind chimes.

15:03.280 --> 15:06.250
Are you afraid to make
a <i>real bet?</i>

15:06.320 --> 15:07.920
No, I just...

15:07.990 --> 15:09.560
( <i>clucking )</i>

15:09.620 --> 15:11.190
You know, Simpson

15:11.260 --> 15:12.490
you're starting
to annoy me.

15:12.560 --> 15:14.730
How about this, henny penny?

15:14.790 --> 15:17.890
If Bart wins tomorrow,
you have to mow my lawn.

15:17.960 --> 15:21.290
All right, and if Todd wins,
you have to mow my lawn

15:21.370 --> 15:24.410
and do a decent job of it
for a change!

15:24.470 --> 15:27.110
Better yet, you have
to mow my lawn

15:27.170 --> 15:29.310
in your wife's
Sunday dress!

15:29.370 --> 15:33.900
You have yourself a bet,
you... jackaninny!

15:33.980 --> 15:36.150
Read that back to me, Marge.

15:36.210 --> 15:39.080
"The father of the loser
mows the lawn..."

15:39.150 --> 15:40.420
Just a minute.

15:40.490 --> 15:42.190
Loser is such a harsh word.

15:42.250 --> 15:44.920
Couldn't we say
the boy who doesn't win?

15:44.990 --> 15:46.330
Oh, man. Fine.

15:46.390 --> 15:48.800
"The father of the boy
who doesn't win

15:48.860 --> 15:51.870
has to mow the lawn
in his wife's Sunday dress."

15:51.930 --> 15:53.030
There you go.

15:53.100 --> 15:55.600
Now, I suppose you both
have to sign this.

15:55.670 --> 15:57.740
I hope blood
won't be necessary.

15:57.800 --> 15:59.730
I'm game if you are,
Flanders.

16:02.170 --> 16:03.370
( <i>sighs )</i>

16:03.440 --> 16:04.910
Good gravy, what have I done?

16:04.980 --> 16:06.880
Keep your left arm straight,
Bart.

16:06.950 --> 16:08.220
Rotate your shoulders.

16:08.280 --> 16:09.150
Dad!
Dad!

16:09.210 --> 16:10.540
Look, son.

16:10.620 --> 16:12.590
All I'm asking
is that you try.

16:12.650 --> 16:13.990
Okay, I'll try.

16:14.050 --> 16:15.590
Anybody can try!

16:15.650 --> 16:17.720
I want you to win!

16:18.790 --> 16:19.860
( <i>screams )</i>

16:26.860 --> 16:28.030
Homer?

16:28.100 --> 16:30.170
Marge? Give me your honest
opinion.

16:30.240 --> 16:32.610
This or this?

16:45.080 --> 16:46.340
Ahhh!

16:46.420 --> 16:47.760
Good morning, son.

16:47.820 --> 16:49.520
Oh, by the way, today's the day
of the big tournament.

16:49.590 --> 16:50.820
And you'd better win!

16:50.890 --> 16:51.760
Dad!

16:51.820 --> 16:53.720
See you downstairs, boy.

16:58.160 --> 16:59.090
Heh, heh, heh.

16:59.160 --> 17:00.460
That crazy Marmaduke.

17:00.530 --> 17:01.900
Eighth hole.

17:01.970 --> 17:03.100
Aim for the octopus,
third tentacle.

17:03.170 --> 17:04.200
12th hole.

17:04.270 --> 17:05.240
Bank it off
the pink tombstone.

17:05.300 --> 17:07.030
Nirvana.

17:07.109 --> 17:09.609
A state of bliss attained
through the extinction
of the self.

17:09.670 --> 17:12.140
Here you go, Bart.
A lumberjack's breakfast
for my little golfer.

17:12.210 --> 17:15.819
Mom, Bart is on a strict diet
of complex carbohydrates.

17:15.880 --> 17:17.579
Steak will make him logy.

17:17.650 --> 17:19.950
Well, what won't make him logy?

17:20.020 --> 17:20.619
Oatmeal.

17:20.690 --> 17:21.790
Oatmeal?!

17:21.849 --> 17:24.010
Oats are what
a champion thoroughbred eats

17:24.089 --> 17:26.359
before he or she wins
the Kentucky Derby.

17:26.420 --> 17:27.619
News flash, Lisa.

17:27.690 --> 17:29.860
Bart is not a horse.

17:29.930 --> 17:30.760
Eat your steak, boy.

17:44.080 --> 17:46.280
Announcer:
( British accent )
<i>Good afternoon, everybody</i>

17:46.340 --> 17:47.970
<i>and welcome to the finale
of what has already been</i>

17:48.050 --> 17:50.320
<i>a stirring afternoon
of miniature golf.</i>

17:50.380 --> 17:53.690
<i>The cream has risen.
The wheat has bid farewell
to the chaff.</i>

17:53.750 --> 17:57.090
And now we approach
the championship match with but
two warriors remaining:

17:57.160 --> 17:59.060
the heretofore unknown
Bart Simpson

17:59.120 --> 18:00.750
and Todd Flanders,

18:00.830 --> 18:04.160
one of the most skilled
ten-year-olds to ever
take back the blade.

18:04.230 --> 18:07.470
Bart, having never received
any words of encouragement
myself, I'm not sure

18:07.530 --> 18:09.900
how they're
supposed to sound

18:09.970 --> 18:11.240
but here goes.

18:11.300 --> 18:12.560
I believe in you.

18:12.640 --> 18:13.610
Thanks, man.

18:13.670 --> 18:14.980
Oh Lord,
we beseech thee...

18:15.040 --> 18:16.610
Hey Flanders,
it's no use praying.

18:16.670 --> 18:18.800
I already did
the same thing

18:18.880 --> 18:20.750
and we can't both win.

18:20.810 --> 18:24.050
Actually <i>Simp-son, we were
praying that no one gets hurt.</i>

18:24.120 --> 18:26.750
Oh, well, <i>Flan-ders,
it doesn't matter.</i>

18:26.820 --> 18:27.890
This time tomorrow

18:27.950 --> 18:28.980
you'll be wearing high heels.

18:29.050 --> 18:29.980
No, you will.

18:30.050 --> 18:30.910
- Afraid not.
- Afraid so.

18:30.990 --> 18:31.630
Afraid not.
Afraid so.

18:31.690 --> 18:32.760
Afraid not, infinity.

18:32.820 --> 18:33.480
Afraid so,
infinity plus one.

18:33.560 --> 18:34.290
D-ohhh!

18:35.890 --> 18:37.120
Announcer:
<i>Young Flanders has the honor</i>

18:37.200 --> 18:38.870

<i>Yes, sir!</i>

18:46.970 --> 18:48.110
Oh, man.

18:48.170 --> 18:50.830
( exhaling )
Tree falling in the woods.

18:50.910 --> 18:52.050
Tree falling in...

19:01.320 --> 19:02.460
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

Mercy is for the weak, Todd!

19:09.360 --> 19:10.700
Yay!

19:21.540 --> 19:22.880
Yay!

19:28.310 --> 19:28.910
D-ohhh!

Yay!

<i>If one were to look up

<i>deadlocked at eight strokes

19:43.160 --> 19:44.770
<i>Soon, one man will

He will drink naught

19:57.410 --> 19:58.010
It's okay, son.

19:58.080 --> 19:59.350
You can recover.

19:59.410 --> 20:00.480
Come on, Bart.

20:00.550 --> 20:02.820
Remember what
Vince Lombardi said--

20:02.880 --> 20:05.390
'If you lose,
you're out of the family.'

20:05.450 --> 20:06.720
Homer!

Ow!

Whew!

20:19.000 --> 20:20.430
Neither man
showing his best form.

20:20.500 --> 20:21.670
This sort of pressure

20:21.730 --> 20:25.100
can unhinge even the steeliest
of competitors.

20:25.170 --> 20:27.170
This is pretty tense,
isn't it, Todd?

20:27.240 --> 20:29.340
Yeah. My knees
are shaking

20:29.410 --> 20:31.710
I got butterflies in my stomach

20:31.780 --> 20:33.980
but I guess
this builds character.

20:34.050 --> 20:35.520
Who wants to build character?

20:35.580 --> 20:36.520
Let's quit.

20:36.580 --> 20:37.450
Okay.

20:38.650 --> 20:40.850
We decided
we're equally good.

20:40.920 --> 20:42.560
We wanna call it a draw, man.

20:42.620 --> 20:44.220
Hmm.
Hmm.

20:44.290 --> 20:45.060
Announcer:
Highly irregular.

20:46.890 --> 20:49.260
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a draw.

20:49.330 --> 20:50.500
A draw?

20:50.560 --> 20:52.500
Forgive an old Brit for crying

20:52.560 --> 20:54.760
but this is
the most stirring display

20:54.830 --> 20:56.860
of gallantry and sportsmanship

20:56.930 --> 20:59.900
since Mountbatten
gave Egypt back to the Punjabis.

20:59.970 --> 21:01.410
Put her there, man.

21:01.470 --> 21:02.630
Yeah, all right.

21:05.610 --> 21:06.950
Well, Homer

21:07.010 --> 21:09.020
our kids
showed us something today, huh?

21:09.080 --> 21:11.620
By working together,
we <i>can both be winners.</i>

21:11.680 --> 21:14.710
Thank heaven, neither of us
has to go through

21:14.790 --> 21:16.220
with that silly wager.
Put her there, pal.

21:16.290 --> 21:19.290
Oh, so you're going
to welch on our bet?!

21:19.360 --> 21:21.630
What are you talking about?
Neither boy lost.

21:21.690 --> 21:23.120
I got it in right here
in writing.

21:23.190 --> 21:25.290
"The father of the boy
who doesn't win

21:25.360 --> 21:28.760
has to mow the lawn
in his wife's Sunday dress."

21:28.830 --> 21:31.900
Yeah, but neith--
I mean we're both..
You have to do it too.

21:31.970 --> 21:33.070
It's a small price
to pay

21:33.140 --> 21:35.040
to see you
humiliate yourself.

21:35.110 --> 21:37.940
( <i>whistles, jeers and laughter)</i>

21:40.550 --> 21:42.920
Hmm, my best dress.

21:42.980 --> 21:44.620
Why do I get the feeling
that someday

21:44.680 --> 21:46.680
I'll be describing this
to a psychiatrist?

21:46.750 --> 21:48.520
Listen to them laughing.

21:48.590 --> 21:50.490
This is so humiliating.

21:50.560 --> 21:52.130
I'm never gonna live this down.

21:52.190 --> 21:53.530
Damn Flanders.

21:53.590 --> 21:56.460
You know, Simpson,
I feel kind of silly

21:56.530 --> 21:58.470
but what the hay?

21:58.530 --> 22:00.070
Kinda reminds me of my
good ol' fraternity days.

22:00.130 --> 22:01.400
D-ohhh!

22:01.470 --> 22:02.640
Oh, my God!

22:02.700 --> 22:04.070
He's enjoying it.
