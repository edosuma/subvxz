So the seams are very evident
and not camera-ready,

36:50.858 --> 36:52.450
especially at the knees.

36:52.527 --> 36:56.287
So overall it may be
a better idea than execution.

36:56.364 --> 36:59.165
Choosing to do a Barbie-style
head, I get it.

36:59.242 --> 37:01.218
You were making the neck
like a ball joint,

37:01.294 --> 37:02.794
but that was a huge mistake.

37:02.870 --> 37:06.464
The linear nature of that
neck joint is so disruptive

37:06.541 --> 37:09.226
to the flow of the rest
of your design.

37:09.302 --> 37:11.511
If you would've made
a really cool join there,

37:11.546 --> 37:13.680
like you did on the elbows
and knees,

37:13.756 --> 37:16.849

on a different trajectory.

40:11.601 --> 40:12.984
