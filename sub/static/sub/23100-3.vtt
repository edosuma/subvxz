01:30.500 --> 01:32.208
Let's start the rehearsal.

01:32.291 --> 01:33.916
Mad Scientist Bug.

01:36.250 --> 01:37.250
That's your cue.

01:37.333 --> 01:39.291
Oh, uh...

01:39.375 --> 01:44.041
My tickle-me machine is, uh,
ready at last.

01:44.125 --> 01:49.500
Soon the whole world will be helpless
with laughter.

01:51.041 --> 01:53.958
Think again, Mad Scientist Bug.

01:54.041 --> 01:58.458
The Silver Skater is here
to foil your evil plan.

01:58.541 --> 01:59.916
Whoo-hoo!

02:00.000 --> 02:05.166
Hello! Can the Silver Skater
please be careful of my pictures?

02:06.583 --> 02:09.250
You don't scare me, Skater.

02:09.333 --> 02:13.500
Release the, uh... Slime Monster!

02:13.583 --> 02:16.541
Glub, glub, glubee.

02:16.625 --> 02:21.416
-I'll slime you to slithereens!
-Hyah!

02:21.500 --> 02:27.750
Take a hike, Slime Monster.
The Ninja Princess is here. Hyah!

02:27.833 --> 02:31.958
Watch out for my... lamp!

02:32.041 --> 02:37.250
And here comes the best-est
super bug hero of all!

02:38.166 --> 02:39.541
Super Bug!

02:42.166 --> 02:44.083
-Not my pictures!
-Oopsie.

02:44.166 --> 02:45.458
Time-out!

02:47.166 --> 02:49.458
I know everyone's having oodles of fun,

02:49.541 --> 02:54.208
but can we all be
a teensy bit more careful?

02:54.291 --> 02:57.583
The Silver Skater can't be careful.

02:57.666 --> 02:59.541
Let's just play at someone else's house.

02:59.625 --> 03:03.583
But we already tried that, remember?

03:04.250 --> 03:09.625
First we tried Jay's house,
but it was too, uh... messy.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.958
So, does it smell
like old socks in here?

03:14.041 --> 03:18.666
Then we tried Buzz's house,
but it was too... small.

03:18.750 --> 03:21.541
Super Bug to--

03:21.625 --> 03:27.500
So, we tried Kumi's house, but there were
too many... fun things to distract us.

03:27.583 --> 03:31.958
♪ Spoon-spinning love, spoon-spinning love
With the spoon spin ♪

03:32.041 --> 03:35.500
And my house was too,
uh, scien-crific.

03:35.583 --> 03:38.375
Oh, Walter, please don't squish that...

03:38.458 --> 03:40.333
Buzz, that's not a toy.

03:40.416 --> 03:43.083
Jay, that experiment is very, um...

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
unstable.

03:47.083 --> 03:51.208
So, it seems like no-one's house is,
well, perfect.

03:51.291 --> 03:54.666
I told you we can stay here
as long as everyone is careful.

03:54.750 --> 03:56.500
We are being careful, Walter.

03:56.583 --> 03:59.708
Yeah, you're freaking out
for no reason.

04:00.625 --> 04:04.625
Uncle Tusk's lamp.
My most prized possession.

04:04.708 --> 04:08.666
-But... But I didn't mean to.
-That's it!

04:08.750 --> 04:11.041
I'm out of here!

04:12.458 --> 04:14.291
Oh, wait. This is my house.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
Everyone else, please leave!

04:21.750 --> 04:24.750
By my, uh, crickto-calculations,

04:24.833 --> 04:28.291
the scale of bug arguing
has just reached level ten.

04:28.375 --> 04:31.166
Extreme botheration.

04:31.250 --> 04:35.041
Look, no one will play with anyone.

04:41.458 --> 04:43.625
Problem identified.

04:44.250 --> 04:47.416
Friends arguing over where to play.

04:47.500 --> 04:50.333
No home is perfect. Solution?

04:52.416 --> 04:55.916
I know. We need a new place.

04:56.000 --> 05:00.458
A place that isn't anyone's
because it's everyone's.

05:00.541 --> 05:02.708
But where could that--?

05:02.791 --> 05:04.208
Ooh!

05:06.333 --> 05:07.750
Yes!

05:07.833 --> 05:11.333
A house in a tree.

05:11.416 --> 05:16.791
A tree house,
where we can all come together and play.

05:16.875 --> 05:18.208
Uh...

05:18.291 --> 05:20.416
New problem identified.

05:20.500 --> 05:26.083
How do I, uh, bring arguing friends
together to build this?

05:47.958 --> 05:51.750
Draw it and they will come, I hope.

05:51.833 --> 05:55.916
-What you doing, Cricks?
-Just designing a tree house.

05:56.750 --> 06:00.125
-How come trees need a house?
-No, no. It's for us.

06:00.208 --> 06:03.583
A house in a tree where we can play.

06:03.666 --> 06:08.958
Awesome! Now, does it have lots
and lots of room for me to fly up, up, up?

06:09.041 --> 06:13.833
It could, but I need some spider silk
for safety lines and--

06:13.916 --> 06:16.500
Sure. I'll get some from Doris.

06:16.583 --> 06:19.291
Boink!

06:19.375 --> 06:23.541
-What's she so excited about?
-I'm designing a tree house.

06:23.625 --> 06:27.000
A tree house? Okay.
You know what it really needs?

06:27.083 --> 06:30.666
A deck where you could sit out
and read, like this.

06:30.750 --> 06:34.958
Mmm. But we'll have to get
more twigs and supports.

06:35.708 --> 06:37.750
I can get all that.

06:37.833 --> 06:40.666
So, what's this tree house thing? Oh!

06:40.750 --> 06:44.375
You know what would make it cool?
A slide. A cool slide.

06:44.458 --> 06:48.500
Okay. But we'll need
some cardboard tubes and--

06:48.583 --> 06:52.166
-Oh, I know where to get those.
-Why do bugs keep coming in here?

06:52.250 --> 06:54.375
Oh, I'm planning a tree house.

06:54.458 --> 06:56.083
Hmm. Not bad.

06:56.708 --> 07:02.958
Oh, but it would be so much better
with an elevator, like... like so.

07:03.041 --> 07:06.458
Well, then I need more rope
and a seat and--

07:06.541 --> 07:09.333
I'm all over it like a slug on lettuce.

07:09.416 --> 07:11.791
So far, so good.

07:32.583 --> 07:35.416
Can I please borrow some silk, Doris?

07:35.500 --> 07:37.583
Take what you need, honey pea.

07:37.666 --> 07:39.375
Just be careful not to...

07:42.333 --> 07:43.583
do just that.

07:48.625 --> 07:50.625
Look out below!

07:50.708 --> 07:52.083
Whoa!

08:01.291 --> 08:04.750
Wait, wait up.
I want... I wanna play, too.

08:08.541 --> 08:10.166
-Crick! Look out!
-Watch out!

08:10.250 --> 08:11.125
Oh, my...

08:22.666 --> 08:26.583
That was awesome!

08:27.375 --> 08:30.583
-Why'd you almost run us over?
-It wasn't my fault.

08:30.666 --> 08:34.416
-It was Buzz.
-It wasn't me. It was Doris's web.

08:34.500 --> 08:37.166
Everything's gone dark.

08:37.250 --> 08:39.750
Walter, calm down.

08:39.832 --> 08:41.375
That's enough!

08:41.457 --> 08:45.416
You... You bugs have got to stop arguing!

08:45.500 --> 08:47.541
If you could only hear yourselves.

08:47.625 --> 08:49.791
You sound crazy.

08:50.416 --> 08:53.416
Well, I can sound crazy, too.

08:53.500 --> 08:55.208

But we can't build it
if we fight all the time.

09:50.416 --> 09:51.916
Whoa!

09:52.000 --> 09:55.416
It's even cooler than before.
Who added the twisty slide?

09:55.500 --> 09:58.208
Me. Who added the awesome elevator?

09:58.291 --> 10:00.166
That was moi!

10:00.250 --> 10:06.500
And I put in extra space
for flying and bouncing.

10:06.583 --> 10:07.916
Nice one, Buzz.

10:08.000 --> 10:13.125
So, I'm gonna start building,
but I'll need all your help.

11:41.375 --> 11:42.833
Hyah!

11:42.916 --> 11:45.208
So does the Ninja Princess!

11:45.291 --> 11:48.458
Super Duper Bug thinks it's awesome, too!

11:48.541 --> 11:50.375
I even wrote you a new part.

11:50.458 --> 11:52.916
You're not a mad scientist anymore.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.666
Huh? Who am I, then?

11:54.750 --> 11:57.875
You are the quiet genius
who stops the super bugs fighting.

11:57.958 --> 12:00.541
And brings them all together as a team.

12:00.625 --> 12:04.916
Because... Because together
we can do anything!

12:21.125 --> 12:22.833
Ribbety-dibbety-bibbety-bow.

12:22.916 --> 12:27.000
Hey, young bug brothers and sisters,
I'm good to go.

12:27.083 --> 12:29.958
-Y'all ready to roll?
-I was ready yesterday, Boris.

12:30.041 --> 12:31.375
Wish me luck!

12:32.750 --> 12:34.000
Jay, wait.

12:34.083 --> 12:39.875
The chances of breaking a limb are,
by my calculations, alarmingly high.

12:48.416 --> 12:49.916
- Yeah!
- Yay!

12:50.000 --> 12:52.875
Absolutely tumble-riffic.

12:57.041 --> 12:58.333
Whoo-hoo!

13:00.208 --> 13:03.208
Positively twirl-a-licious.

13:03.875 --> 13:07.708
I'm terrified, yet strangely excited.

13:18.291 --> 13:20.375
You've got this, little bug sister.

13:20.458 --> 13:22.583
Remember, be the bounce.

13:32.208 --> 13:33.666
Ta-da!

13:34.125 --> 13:37.958
That was, uh... crash-flop-ulous?

13:42.333 --> 13:43.541
Chin up, young bug.

13:43.625 --> 13:47.625
Remember, long as you bounce,
it always counts.

13:49.583 --> 13:53.500
Uh, Kumi, something's wrong
with your head sticks.

13:56.208 --> 13:58.958
This always happens
when the weather's about to change.

14:01.083 --> 14:04.500
You're saying that they are capable
of predicting the weather?

14:04.583 --> 14:07.583
Yes, and it's really annoying.

14:07.666 --> 14:12.791
It's about to... rain!

14:15.291 --> 14:18.791
Guys, we'd better get inside.
It's gonna pour.

14:18.875 --> 14:24.291
But according to my weather pre-crick-tor,
today will remain perfectly sunny.

14:26.250 --> 14:27.500
Uh-oh.

14:39.416 --> 14:42.291
See you, Boris!

14:42.375 --> 14:46.333
Man, some folks just can't handle the wet.

14:49.875 --> 14:53.375
So bored.

14:53.458 --> 14:58.166
One day of rain is tiresome,
but three days is insufferable.

14:58.250 --> 15:00.791
Crick, how much longer must we wait?

15:01.958 --> 15:07.750
It seems that in wet conditions,
the weather pre-crick-tor unfortunately...

15:07.833 --> 15:09.541
-Breaks?
-Yeah.

15:09.625 --> 15:10.791
Yeah, it breaks.

15:10.875 --> 15:15.250
So, on three, I'm going to perform
a tumble-riffic bounce.

15:15.333 --> 15:17.916
I daresay that's more of an outdoor game.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.416
Chillax, Walter.

15:20.500 --> 15:23.500
Okay, Buzz, one, two...

15:24.708 --> 15:26.291
Ta-da!

15:26.375 --> 15:27.791
Ouchie.

15:27.875 --> 15:30.041
Told you. Outdoor game.

15:31.250 --> 15:32.875
You okay, Buzz?
What are you doing?

15:32.958 --> 15:37.250
Wishing. Wishing to stop the rain
so we can play outside.

15:37.333 --> 15:38.750
Good idea, Buzz.

15:38.833 --> 15:42.625
Or we could, like,
tie the grass tops together.

15:42.708 --> 15:45.125
Oh, yeah, to make a roof for the village.

15:45.208 --> 15:49.750
What we need is a magical slug sun dance.

15:49.833 --> 15:52.125
A magic dance?

15:54.083 --> 15:56.416
I've got a way better idea than that.

15:56.500 --> 15:58.500
I mean, Crick has.

15:58.583 --> 16:01.166
We're totally gonna stop the rain first.

16:01.250 --> 16:03.375
Yeah, sure. Right after I do.

16:03.458 --> 16:06.833
Ha! My magic sun dance will beat you all.

16:06.916 --> 16:08.541
We're so going to win.

16:08.625 --> 16:10.000
You so aren't.

16:13.083 --> 16:15.958
Fighting won't stop the rain.

16:16.041 --> 16:19.666
Hey, you, sun, go no way.

16:19.750 --> 16:23.041
Rain, shoo, away.
Go again, hey, go, go.

16:23.125 --> 16:27.291
Join me, Buzz.
The louder it is, the better it works.

16:28.250 --> 16:33.000
You watch. As soon as Mr. Sun hears
our glorious chant,

16:33.083 --> 16:35.875
he'll send those clouds packing.

16:35.958 --> 16:42.166
Hey, you, sun, go no way.
Rain, shoo, away...

16:52.083 --> 16:55.541
-Kumi, what's that?
-Cool, huh?

16:55.625 --> 16:59.500
I'm calling it the Wet-Get-Go.

16:59.583 --> 17:01.416
I just hope it works.

17:04.415 --> 17:05.625
Yes.

17:05.708 --> 17:09.750
With a big enough Wet-Get-Go,
we could protect the whole village.

17:09.833 --> 17:12.750
-What do you think?
-Yuck, that's great!

17:12.833 --> 17:18.290
Uh, thanks. But yuck usually means
horrible or disgusting.

17:19.250 --> 17:20.458
Oh.

17:27.790 --> 17:31.041
-Yuck?
-Now you're getting it.

17:31.583 --> 17:35.500
Ha. Using high-velocity, uh,
throwing technology,

17:35.583 --> 17:40.458
the cloud catcher will send
the large silk net over the clouds,

17:40.541 --> 17:42.291
-trapping them.
-Awesome!

17:42.375 --> 17:45.166
Then we winch them
carefully to the ground.

17:45.250 --> 17:47.041
Rain stop. Thanks to my--

17:47.125 --> 17:51.083
-I mean, our brilliant idea.
-You guys think the smartest.

17:57.375 --> 17:58.916
You'd better step back.

17:59.000 --> 18:03.666
Once I release this crank,
the cloud catcher will spin quite fast.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.208
Ooh!

18:12.416 --> 18:14.791
Squishee!

18:16.833 --> 18:19.625
Quick, Jay. Reel her in!

18:25.708 --> 18:28.875
Yuck. The yuckiest.

18:28.958 --> 18:32.416
Yeah, all right.
That's the spot right there.

18:32.500 --> 18:34.125
Get down, Brother Boris.

18:36.750 --> 18:38.666
Get down, little sister!

18:47.125 --> 18:48.958
Huh?

18:49.041 --> 18:51.666
-Hi, Boris.
-Hey, young sister.

18:51.750 --> 18:52.916
Didn't see you there.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.708
So, where are all the other
bug brothers and sisters?

18:55.791 --> 18:59.041
They're trying to stop the rain.

18:59.125 --> 19:01.666
Now, why would
they want to go and do that?

19:01.750 --> 19:04.333
Rain's the toy
that doesn't need no batteries.

19:04.416 --> 19:06.583
Rain's the fun that doesn't need no sun.

19:06.666 --> 19:11.250
But rain is all... yuck, isn't it?

19:11.333 --> 19:13.541
Hmm. Lookie here, young bug.

19:13.625 --> 19:15.875
Maybe you'd better hang
with me for a while.

What are you two doing
out in this terrible storm?

21:25.083 --> 21:29.416
Well, brother slug, we're having a ball
while the rain falls.

21:29.500 --> 21:35.541
Yeah, you can go splashy

21:37.166 --> 21:40.750
-Quite, uh, fascinating.
-But it's time we headed home.

21:40.833 --> 21:43.166
Before we're utterly soaked through.

21:45.958 --> 21:49.250
-It's getting worse.
-How can we go anywhere in this downpour?

21:49.333 --> 21:52.083
We'll all be drenched. Drenched!
