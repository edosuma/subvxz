WEBVTT

00:01.330 --> 00:02.525
- Previously on Being Human...

00:02.570 --> 00:04.368
- How did you die?
- I have no idea.

00:04.400 --> 00:07.768
All night, I watched Danny and
Bridget swoon over each other.

00:07.800 --> 00:12.135
- Who is Bridget?
- My best friend, who I now realize is a brutal whore.

00:12.180 --> 00:14.808
- Bishop wants us to go after
more people of influence.

00:14.840 --> 00:17.070
- The hospital is off-limits
for recruiting.

00:17.110 --> 00:18.748
- I wanna take you out.

00:18.780 --> 00:21.249
- You talk me again,
it's your ass.

00:21.280 --> 00:24.011
- You know, you suck
at being a werewolf.

00:24.050 --> 00:26.155
- What are you talking about?
- I'm a werewolf too.

00:26.190 --> 00:27.919
- Ray's a pretty decent guy.

00:27.960 --> 00:30.486
He's got nowhere to stay.
Maybe he could crash here.

00:30.530 --> 00:32.624
- We hardly know him.
- What you gonna do?

00:32.659 --> 00:34.697
Rip me to shreds
in this kitchen

00:34.730 --> 00:36.425
and prove to
your friend, Josh,

00:36.470 --> 00:39.064
what a murderous scum
we both know you to be?

00:39.100 --> 00:40.659
- There are vampires
in there?

00:40.700 --> 00:43.135
- Tear him apart!

00:53.880 --> 00:57.384
- (Sally): Every culture has
its own way of saying goodbye.

01:04.590 --> 01:10.495
** T found a letter
that read *

01:12.440 --> 01:15.239
* Qur existence... *

01:15.270 --> 01:19.059
Comfort's in the rituals that
prepare the living for death.

01:19.110 --> 01:22.978
* If it's turned on *

01:23.010 --> 01:28.414
* Turned on the television *

01:30.220 --> 01:32.985
* And this time, maybe *

01:33.020 --> 01:37.082
* The wall is collapsing *

01:38.790 --> 01:41.327
* I think it's coming... *

01:42.530 --> 01:45.659
They ease the journey
into what comes after...

01:47.870 --> 01:51.465
* I'm hearing whispers
from an infinite... *

01:51.510 --> 01:54.377
...assuming there is an after.

01:54.410 --> 01:56.845
* And I don't know why it is *

01:56.880 --> 01:58.609
* T feel it coming *

01:58.650 --> 02:02.712
* I think it's
real insignificant **

02:02.750 --> 02:06.709
But in the end, death is
a journey you take alone.

02:08.289 --> 02:10.348
For some of us,
that journey takes us

02:10.389 --> 02:14.156
on a hidden path
through a darker forest,

02:14.200 --> 02:16.521
where instead of answers,

02:16.570 --> 02:19.733
we only find a whole new
set of questions.

02:27.780 --> 02:31.410
- This is the
carotid artery.

02:31.450 --> 02:34.545
There's one on each
side of the neck.

02:36.920 --> 02:40.879
- I'm ready!
- Shut up and listen!

02:40.920 --> 02:42.752
You're here to clean.

02:42.790 --> 02:45.953
And it's like tapping
straight into a geyser.

02:45.990 --> 02:50.928
You can decide later if
you're a lefty or a righty.

02:50.970 --> 02:52.859
(Screaming)

02:54.840 --> 02:56.569
That's right.

02:56.610 --> 02:59.602
The first gush
is the freshest,

02:59.640 --> 03:01.870
the sweetest,
isn't it?

03:01.910 --> 03:03.400
Hmm...

03:03.450 --> 03:08.672
Now, it is customary
to share your first kill.

03:25.400 --> 03:28.233
** T've been trying *

03:28.270 --> 03:30.830
* To find you *

03:30.870 --> 03:33.908
* I've been looking *

03:33.940 --> 03:36.773
* All around *

03:36.810 --> 03:40.144
* I've been wishing *

03:40.180 --> 03:43.718
* For the answers *

03:43.750 --> 03:46.139
%
Every day since **

03:50.890 --> 03:52.699
(Creaking)

03:52.730 --> 03:55.097
- I feel like
I am in a submarine

03:55.130 --> 03:56.154
that is about to blow!

03:56.200 --> 03:57.668
You have to stop.

03:57.700 --> 03:59.225
- This isn't me.

03:59.270 --> 04:02.331
- Ever since you got back from
talking to Danny and Bridget,

04:02.370 --> 04:05.032
it has been Amityville
Horror Plumbing.

04:05.070 --> 04:06.572
You are poltergeist-ing
your own house.

04:06.610 --> 04:08.977
- I said goodbye.
I made my peace.

04:09.010 --> 04:11.479
I gave them my blessing.
- Then why does it--

04:11.510 --> 04:13.012
(Rumbling)

04:13.050 --> 04:15.610
Why does it sound like
the house is gonna eat us?

04:15.650 --> 04:17.641
- I don't know. I...

04:17.690 --> 04:18.918
I just...
I'm really...

04:18.950 --> 04:20.850
I'm not trying
to do anything.

04:20.890 --> 04:24.986
- OK, well, so there's just
nothing that you're upset about?

04:25.030 --> 04:27.795
- No. Mm-mmm.
- Nothing?

04:27.830 --> 04:29.491
(Water bubbling)

04:29.530 --> 04:31.419
(Whimpering)

04:32.870 --> 04:35.032
Oh!

04:35.070 --> 04:36.629
Oh...

04:36.670 --> 04:38.399
I don't know how
to make it stop.

04:38.440 --> 04:39.976
(Ray chuckling)

04:40.010 --> 04:41.899
- That might be me.

04:41.940 --> 04:45.149
I just flooded the
toilet. (Ray laughing)

04:46.620 --> 04:50.341
- I think that the fact
that we are drowning in sewage

04:50.390 --> 04:52.711
is a sign you
should be moving on.

04:52.760 --> 04:54.114
You've been here
for a month.

04:54.160 --> 04:55.912
- Yeah, I've got
so much joy in me,

04:55.960 --> 04:59.328
not even your cadaverous
mug can ruin it.

05:00.530 --> 05:03.397
Mmm... Ah!

05:03.430 --> 05:05.194
I'm starving
after last night.

05:05.230 --> 05:08.165
There's nothing like
a little late-night exercise

05:08.200 --> 05:09.736
to get the appetite going.

05:09.770 --> 05:11.738
- I'm sure I don't wanna know
what you're talking about.

05:11.770 --> 05:13.534
- (Ray):
There he is.

05:15.140 --> 05:17.074
Sleeping it off?

05:17.110 --> 05:18.600
- What happened there?

05:20.150 --> 05:23.518
- Oh, that was just some...

05:23.550 --> 05:27.009
drunk idiots...
being idiots.

05:27.060 --> 05:28.710
(Chuckling)

05:28.760 --> 05:31.980
- They were baked,
all bloated up.

05:32.030 --> 05:34.249
The city is hell, man.

05:34.300 --> 05:38.396
That's why I like the country,
the woods, nature...

05:38.430 --> 05:40.296
But those degenerates,

05:40.340 --> 05:43.537
they picked the wrong
night to walk on-- - Ray...

05:43.570 --> 05:48.804
- And this boy, with the
puppy eyes, he's a killer.

05:48.840 --> 05:52.299
It's the shy ones you gotta
watch out for, - The sink's, uh...

05:52.350 --> 05:55.320
- I know.
Call a plumber.

05:57.220 --> 06:00.815
- I'll call Danny.
Um, do you want a ride tonight?

06:00.860 --> 06:04.228
- You're off the hook. Me and
Josh are turning together.

06:09.630 --> 06:11.462
- Really?

06:13.000 --> 06:14.263
Hey, Ray...

06:16.770 --> 06:18.431
You sure about that?

06:19.540 --> 06:21.304
(Sighing)

06:22.510 --> 06:24.399
(Siren wailing)

06:25.410 --> 06:26.969
- Hey!

06:28.080 --> 06:31.118
We're gonna meet at the shed
after sunset, right?

06:32.320 --> 06:33.913
(Chuckling)

06:35.820 --> 06:38.585
I just hope it's not
too much of a letdown

06:38.630 --> 06:42.294
after stomping the crap out
of them fangers last night.

06:43.730 --> 06:47.394
- I just... I have to go
mail something, so...

06:48.540 --> 06:52.329
- We're gonna
run together, all right?

06:56.380 --> 06:58.246
Unleashed!

07:00.080 --> 07:01.969
(Siren wailing)

07:02.020 --> 07:04.284
(Man 1 groaning loudly)

07:04.320 --> 07:05.742
- Help us hold him!

07:13.860 --> 07:16.522
- What's his story?
- Dahmer out there attacked him.

07:16.570 --> 07:19.130
He was ripping out this
guy's neck with his teeth.

07:19.170 --> 07:21.434
Poor guy stabbed him,
but he's so tweaked on PCP

07:21.470 --> 07:22.631
or something, he...

07:22.670 --> 07:24.729
- (Sarin): I need the priest!
The priest!

07:24.770 --> 07:28.035
- (Chuckling): Now he
finds religion. Convenient.

07:29.340 --> 07:31.001
Aidan!

07:31.050 --> 07:32.609
(Groaning)

07:39.490 --> 07:43.358
- = Mr. Sarin...
Mr. Sarin, do you remember me?

07:43.390 --> 07:44.789
I'm Aidan.
- You're the nurse.

07:44.830 --> 07:47.299
- Yes, and I thought we
said goodbye yesterday.

07:47.330 --> 07:49.219
- I screwed up.
I screwed up!

07:49.260 --> 07:51.069
- (Man 2):
I need help over here!

07:51.100 --> 07:53.262
- You know what?
I got this.

07:54.240 --> 07:55.935
- I can't hear
your heart.

07:55.970 --> 07:58.439
- Who did this to you?
Who turned you?

07:58.470 --> 07:59.938
- You're one of us?
Help me!

07:59.980 --> 08:01.300
- Shhh!

08:01.340 --> 08:03.547
- I didn't
see the knife.

08:03.580 --> 08:05.070
The cops were on me--
- Shut up!

08:05.110 --> 08:07.716
- Why were you asking for
the priest? Did he do this?

08:07.750 --> 08:09.548
- Get me out!
- How many did he turn?

08:09.590 --> 08:11.115
- Help me!
- Sedative!

08:13.190 --> 08:14.487
- Get him!

08:15.990 --> 08:17.719
Stop him!
- Get out of the way!

08:17.760 --> 08:19.125
(Gasping)

08:23.400 --> 08:25.027
- I poured in
that drain-clog stuff.

08:25.070 --> 08:27.368
The whole sink
started bubbling over.

08:29.400 --> 08:32.461
- That's pure acid.
It'll eat through the pipes.

08:32.510 --> 08:33.705
- Well, I didn't know
what else to do.

08:33.740 --> 08:36.744
All the sinks, the toilet,
every drain's backed up.

08:36.780 --> 08:40.443
Don't you have one of those snake
things, or whatever you call them?

08:51.860 --> 08:54.420
- This is where Sally fell.

08:55.960 --> 08:57.894
- Mm-hmm.

08:57.930 --> 09:01.491
- Yep. Fell so hard,
I broke the floor.

09:01.540 --> 09:03.201
I don't know, Danny.

09:03.240 --> 09:06.232
Maybe it's time to
change out those tiles.

09:06.270 --> 09:09.501
- I know this
must be hard for you.

09:11.180 --> 09:12.341
- I'm glad you're here.

09:12.380 --> 09:14.417
It makes it easier.

09:14.450 --> 09:18.512
- Hey, you're a raging capitalist
landlord now. (Chuckling)

09:18.550 --> 09:20.757
You gotta take care
of the place, right?

09:37.240 --> 09:39.538
- Think you can squeeze in?

09:45.350 --> 09:47.819
(Bell dinging,
heart beating)

10:03.070 --> 10:04.868
(Bell dinging)

10:08.840 --> 10:11.605
- (Man):
Mary, can we get an IV?

10:14.610 --> 10:17.409
- Could Mr. Sarin find you?

10:19.480 --> 10:21.676
How long have
you been here?

10:21.720 --> 10:24.985
- Transferred from Summerville
a couple of days ago.

10:25.020 --> 10:29.184
I gotta say, I miss
the bustle of a parish.

10:29.220 --> 10:31.689
- So you're
a real priest?

10:31.730 --> 10:33.858
- Ordained 10 years ago.

10:33.900 --> 10:36.289
Holy orders
and everything.

10:36.330 --> 10:39.163
- But prayers, communion...

10:39.200 --> 10:41.498
How do you give mass?

10:41.540 --> 10:43.668
- Nothing's changed for me.

10:43.710 --> 10:47.305
I'm still saving souls,
just in a different way.

10:51.710 --> 10:53.712
Six years ago,

10:53.750 --> 10:57.618
I was dying
of cancer, lymphoma.

10:57.650 --> 10:59.516
I was 34.

11:02.120 --> 11:06.057
In the hospital,
as I looked into that...

11:07.060 --> 11:11.497
abyss, I suddenly knew.

11:11.530 --> 11:15.569
I knew there
was no afterlife.

11:17.440 --> 11:21.707
God spoke to me
like he never had before.

11:21.740 --> 11:23.549
Not in words,

11:23.580 --> 11:27.676
but in a true
and sudden revelation.

11:27.720 --> 11:29.984
This life is all we get.

11:30.020 --> 11:31.613
It was so clear.

11:31.650 --> 11:34.256
- And that wasn't
enough for you?

11:34.290 --> 11:37.555
- Of course not!
I was 34. I wanted to live.

11:38.890 --> 11:42.622
A doctor, a very smart
and sympathetic woman,

11:42.660 --> 11:44.321
pitied me

11:44.370 --> 11:49.160
and offered
me another option.

11:52.510 --> 11:54.103
Don't you see?

11:55.010 --> 11:57.172
God saved me.

11:57.210 --> 12:01.511
I asked him.
I begged him to save me.

12:02.580 --> 12:04.116
And he did.

12:04.150 --> 12:06.915
- So you think that God

12:06.960 --> 12:09.986
wanted you to
become a vampire?

12:10.030 --> 12:15.628
- Well, if God made everything,
then he made vampires too.

12:15.660 --> 12:19.028
Jesus himself
rose from the dead.

12:19.070 --> 12:21.835
- Oh, are you saying
that Jesus was a--

12:21.870 --> 12:23.634
- Gets you thinking,
doesn't it?

12:23.670 --> 12:27.538
- Look, I don't care what
your perverted theology is,

12:27.580 --> 12:30.277
there is no turning
in this hospital.

12:30.310 --> 12:34.213
- Well, unfortunately,
you don't get to make that call.

12:34.250 --> 12:36.469
- What does that mean?

12:36.520 --> 12:39.080
- Bishop's the one
who brought me here.

12:41.990 --> 12:47.952
- So it's gonna be a scary year, but
it's gonna be OK. It's gonna be fine.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.924
- (Man on PA):
Please call 7428.

12:50.970 --> 12:52.563
- I'll see ya soon.

12:55.040 --> 12:58.237
- What are you doing
with Mrs. Maida?

12:58.270 --> 13:00.204
- Excuse me?

13:00.240 --> 13:02.732
- Don't bother my patients.
She just had--

13:02.780 --> 13:04.441
- Hip surgery.
Yeah, I know.

13:04.480 --> 13:05.879
- She needs to rest.

13:05.910 --> 13:08.345
- I'm pretty sure that chatting
with her about her son

13:08.380 --> 13:10.018
is not going to
endanger her hip.

13:10.050 --> 13:11.415
- Her son?
- Her son.

13:11.450 --> 13:12.485
The youngest, Sunil,

13:12.520 --> 13:15.012
he's in Costa Rica for a year
and she's convinced

13:15.060 --> 13:18.086
that he's gonna be macheted
to death by Maoist rebels.

13:18.130 --> 13:20.792
I assured her that
Costa Rica's a democracy.

13:20.830 --> 13:22.093
It's peaceful.

13:22.130 --> 13:25.668
And it's very economically
developed for the region.

13:25.700 --> 13:28.032
- Fascinating,
you listen to NPR.

13:28.070 --> 13:31.404
Since when are you
and Mrs. Maida so tight?

13:31.440 --> 13:34.273
- Oh, I was taking her down
to radiology the other day,

13:34.310 --> 13:36.404
and she mentioned that
she never gets any visitors.

13:36.440 --> 13:38.875
So I said that I
would visit her.

13:38.910 --> 13:40.309
Is that all right
with you?

13:40.350 --> 13:44.685
- It beats mopping up vomit and
changing urine-scented sheets, right?

13:44.720 --> 13:47.587
- Yeah, well, it would...

13:47.620 --> 13:49.782
except it's my day off.

14:05.140 --> 14:06.665
- Sally?

14:10.450 --> 14:12.145
- Will you stop it?

14:12.180 --> 14:13.978
Sally's not here.

14:14.020 --> 14:17.012
- I feel like
I could make contact.

14:18.450 --> 14:20.487
You remember when
she spoke to me?

14:20.520 --> 14:21.783
- Oh, for God's sake,
she didn't speak to you!

14:21.820 --> 14:25.120
- She did.
Well, I--I felt her.

14:25.160 --> 14:28.255
- Do you even think about
how this makes me feel?

14:28.300 --> 14:31.190
You constantly
bringing her up?

14:33.670 --> 14:35.661
- I'm sorry.

14:36.500 --> 14:38.104
It's just...

14:38.140 --> 14:40.700
If you were there,
you would--

14:44.950 --> 14:46.577
- Danny?

14:49.250 --> 14:54.586
I snaked all the drains. All I
found was a hair clog in the shower.

14:54.620 --> 14:56.179
- So that was it?

14:56.220 --> 14:59.429
- That would cause the drains to be a little slow...
- Sorry, Bridg.

14:59.460 --> 15:02.498
- ...but it wouldn't cause
a whole system backup.

15:02.530 --> 15:04.362
I don't think
it's this either.

15:04.400 --> 15:07.791
A rock like that
can't back up anything.

15:14.440 --> 15:16.704
- It's Sally's ring.

15:17.450 --> 15:18.975
- (Sally):
Goddammit!

15:20.080 --> 15:23.618
(Sighing) - Hey, I thought
we were watching a movie.

15:23.650 --> 15:25.789
- I lost my engagement ring.

15:25.820 --> 15:27.219
It fell.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.388
- What?
- It was right here.

15:29.420 --> 15:32.082
I was washing my hands and
it just slipped down the drain.

15:32.130 --> 15:33.689
And I could see it.

15:33.730 --> 15:36.256
I tried to reach in and
I pushed it down further.

15:36.300 --> 15:38.120
- Why'd you take it off?

15:38.170 --> 15:39.990
- It's a little loose

15:40.040 --> 15:42.361
and I was afraid it would
slip off with the soap.

15:42.400 --> 15:44.960
- Oh, so you just
leave it on the sink.

15:45.010 --> 15:47.399
You never told me
it was loose.

15:50.150 --> 15:53.245
- I thought...
Danny, come on.

15:53.280 --> 15:55.248
We'll take the sink apart.
- Why bother?

15:55.280 --> 15:57.009
- What do mean,
"why bother?"

15:57.050 --> 15:59.280
- The ring obviously doesn't
mean anything to you,

15:59.320 --> 16:01.152
if it's even in there.

16:02.260 --> 16:05.525
- OK, look, it was stupid.

16:05.560 --> 16:07.096
OK? I made a mistake.

16:07.130 --> 16:08.222
I shouldn't have
left it on the sink.

16:08.260 --> 16:11.890
- I feel like a real idiot here.
- Danny...

16:11.930 --> 16:13.489
- When else do
you take it off?

16:13.540 --> 16:16.498
When you go out with the girls?
- Of course not.

16:16.540 --> 16:18.531
- Maybe you left it
in some guy's bed!

16:18.570 --> 16:20.709
How the hell am
I supposed to know?

16:23.380 --> 16:25.269
(Creaking)

16:33.290 --> 16:35.281
Oh, I know what
this is about.

16:35.320 --> 16:38.358
It was too crappy for you.
- You know I love that ring!

16:38.390 --> 16:39.949
- Then where
the hell is it!

16:39.990 --> 16:41.628
- I told you, it fell!

16:41.660 --> 16:43.970
Ah! Ah!

17:19.900 --> 17:21.867
- (Bridget): What was
the ring doing in the pipes?

17:21.900 --> 17:23.664
- How am I
supposed to know?

17:25.770 --> 17:28.307
- Maybe the house was
trying to tell you something.

17:28.339 --> 17:31.048
The house wanted you
to have the ring.

17:31.080 --> 17:33.811
- Look, Sally was always
losing it, all right?

17:33.850 --> 17:34.920
She could never
keep it on.

17:34.950 --> 17:38.079
- The house was trying
to tell me how I died.

17:40.520 --> 17:42.750
(Sighing)

17:42.790 --> 17:45.521
(Car alarm sounding)

17:45.560 --> 17:47.722
<i>(Radio):
** I don't know why *</i>

17:47.760 --> 17:50.468
* Our lives
aren't the same... *

17:50.500 --> 17:53.629
- I told you no
recruiting at the hospital.

17:53.670 --> 17:57.129
- Well, you don't
tell me anything.

17:57.170 --> 17:59.707
- Oh, you had
to have Sarin, right?

17:59.740 --> 18:01.708
Because he is
just so... What?

18:01.740 --> 18:04.050
What? What is he exactly?

18:05.880 --> 18:08.713
- Do you know that he died
completely friendless?

18:08.750 --> 18:12.482
Childless, estranged
from his parents.

18:12.520 --> 18:18.220
Lucky for him, he was exquisitely
provided for by the family estate.

18:18.260 --> 18:20.319
Pharmaceuticals, apparently.

18:20.360 --> 18:22.419
- OK, so you turned him
for the money.

18:22.460 --> 18:23.928
Ooh, that is so noble.

18:23.970 --> 18:27.565
- When you call for a cleanup,
who do you think pays for that?

18:27.600 --> 18:29.762
The manpower,
the body bags,

18:29.800 --> 18:32.007
the bribes to make people
turn the other way.

18:32.040 --> 18:34.634
We are vampires, you realize,
and not magicians.

18:34.680 --> 18:37.479
- And turning a priest,
that's what? Just for laughs?

18:37.510 --> 18:39.979
- Well, nobody sells
eternal life like a priest.

18:40.010 --> 18:42.616
- Since when do you
need to sell it?

18:42.650 --> 18:45.915
Anytime that you want someone,
you just take him...

18:45.950 --> 18:47.111
or her.

18:47.160 --> 18:49.583
- That's right.
You missed the meeting.

18:49.620 --> 18:51.486
Um, I'm only turning
the willing now.

18:51.530 --> 18:54.727
The influential,
the useful,

18:54.760 --> 18:58.424
people like Sarin
and Father Gates.

18:58.470 --> 19:00.097
You remember when Lincoln

19:00.130 --> 19:02.667
used the archbishop
to sell the Union cause?

19:02.700 --> 19:05.465
- I was too busy fighting
a war to read the papers.

19:05.510 --> 19:07.376
- Yes, you were very young.

19:07.410 --> 19:08.707
Well, uh, it turns out,

19:08.740 --> 19:10.879
all the great monarchs
have always had

19:10.910 --> 19:15.780
holy men by their sides to consecrate wars...
- Boost their egos.

19:15.820 --> 19:18.482
- ...win over the masses,

19:18.520 --> 19:22.058
from Charles I to,
hell, George W.

19:22.090 --> 19:25.082
Everyone's used religion.

19:25.130 --> 19:26.859
- Used it for what?

19:26.890 --> 19:28.221
- You remember how
we used to say

19:28.260 --> 19:30.991
that being a vampire
was almost perfect?

19:31.030 --> 19:34.466
But the lying,
the hiding,

19:34.500 --> 19:40.280
the stifling day job to cover our
tracks is exhausting and tedious.

19:40.310 --> 19:44.679
When we have the numbers
and we have the power,

19:44.710 --> 19:46.599
we won't have to hide.

19:46.650 --> 19:48.812
<i>- We can live
right out in the open.</i>

19:50.150 --> 19:51.220
- You're not serious.

19:51.250 --> 19:53.252
- I'm sure you've
thought about it.

19:53.290 --> 19:55.509
- How many times have you
drilled it into me?

19:55.560 --> 19:57.779
Keep a low profile,
blend in, be invisible.

19:57.830 --> 19:59.787
- 'Cause we had to.

19:59.830 --> 20:02.197
Soon we won't.

20:02.230 --> 20:04.528
- What happened
to you, Bishop?

20:04.570 --> 20:06.629
- You're asking me?

20:06.670 --> 20:09.731
I can barely stand to look
at you, starving and weak.

20:09.770 --> 20:11.932
- I can't tell if
you're delusional--

20:15.080 --> 20:18.778
- Now, I have been very
patient and understanding

20:18.810 --> 20:22.212
and even helpful during
your little experiment,

20:22.250 --> 20:26.118
but it is time
to wake up, Aidan.

20:26.150 --> 20:28.983
We live forever,
humans don't.

20:29.020 --> 20:30.624
Do the math.

20:30.660 --> 20:32.458
It's evolution.

20:32.490 --> 20:34.925
It's nature
taking its course.

20:34.960 --> 20:39.466
- Yeah, there's nothing
natural about us.

20:42.570 --> 20:45.335
* We'll start to unwind *

20:45.370 --> 20:48.704
* Don't look behind
I'll show you how... *

20:50.350 --> 20:51.545
(Laughing)

20:58.420 --> 21:00.616
* I pack up today *

21:00.660 --> 21:04.688
* Let's go
Let's get away... *

21:04.730 --> 21:08.428
- You're so
confused, Aidan.

21:08.460 --> 21:10.667
You don't even know
what you are.

21:10.700 --> 21:12.623
You're a vampire
playing a human

21:12.670 --> 21:15.230
while shacking up
with an animal.

21:16.770 --> 21:18.636
And a rabid one at that.

21:18.670 --> 21:21.002
(Gasping)

21:24.550 --> 21:27.315
Of course... Hmm...

21:27.350 --> 21:29.045
How could he tell you?

21:29.080 --> 21:30.718
- Tell me what?

21:30.750 --> 21:34.414
- Your wolf has
a taste for vampires.

21:34.460 --> 21:37.623
Muzzle your dog, Aidan,
or we will.

21:37.660 --> 21:41.699
* Will not come back again **

21:48.900 --> 21:50.607
(Birds chirping)

21:54.910 --> 21:58.175
- Glad you
decided to come.

21:58.210 --> 22:00.611
Ready? Huh?

22:00.650 --> 22:02.345
(Chuckling)

22:17.870 --> 22:19.622
(Crying)

22:22.870 --> 22:24.668
(Dishes clattering)

22:25.810 --> 22:28.177
- Sally?

22:33.880 --> 22:38.317
- The house,
the pipes, it was me.

22:40.690 --> 22:44.422
I was trying to
tell myself all along.

22:47.860 --> 22:49.191
- What do you mean?

22:50.030 --> 22:53.432
- It turns out,
I didn't just die.

22:55.040 --> 22:57.566
Danny killed me.

22:59.440 --> 23:03.547
Oh, your face!
- It was an accident. What happened?

23:03.580 --> 23:07.005
- You'd never guess it
by looking at him.

23:07.050 --> 23:09.473
He's so sweet-looking, but...

23:10.490 --> 23:12.185
Danny has a temper.

23:12.220 --> 23:14.860
I never let
myself see it.

23:14.890 --> 23:17.860
"He's passionate."
That's what I told myself.

23:17.890 --> 23:20.894
"He's crazy in love with me
and that's why he's so jealous."

23:20.930 --> 23:24.628
- Sally, I am
SO, SO sorry.

23:26.730 --> 23:28.289
- We had a fight.

23:29.340 --> 23:33.607
He was in a rage
and he shoved me.

23:35.640 --> 23:38.575
And I fell down the stairs.

23:40.380 --> 23:43.611
- All these times
that he has been here,

23:43.650 --> 23:45.311
going on about you.

23:45.350 --> 23:47.114
- He just stood there.

23:47.150 --> 23:50.757
He looked at the evidence
and walked away.

23:50.790 --> 23:52.884
He blamed it on me!

23:55.160 --> 23:57.151
Where are you going?
- I'll be back.

23:57.200 --> 23:58.998
- No! Don't!

23:59.030 --> 24:02.762
- He's not getting away with this.
- Please!

24:05.070 --> 24:06.663
Please.

24:12.650 --> 24:14.618
(Sniffling)

24:21.660 --> 24:23.287
- What are you gonna do?

24:25.290 --> 24:27.019
- I don't know.

24:30.900 --> 24:32.698
- Can you feel it coming?

24:32.730 --> 24:34.562
I enjoy this.

24:36.370 --> 24:40.204
- I wish I could close my eyes,
wake up, and it'd be morning.

24:40.240 --> 24:41.901
- This is just
the beginning.

24:41.940 --> 24:43.408
You and me.

24:43.440 --> 24:45.750
Tomorrow we start.

24:45.780 --> 24:47.714
We'll find more of us.

24:47.750 --> 24:50.549
With your bulbous brain,
it'll be easy.

24:50.590 --> 24:52.342
- Why would we do that?

24:52.390 --> 24:55.212
- A pack, Josh!
Think about it.

24:55.260 --> 24:57.786
A whole team of us
running together,

24:57.830 --> 25:00.458
living together,
like nature intended.

25:00.490 --> 25:02.595
- Nature? You think
this is natural?

25:02.630 --> 25:03.859
- It'll be incredible!

25:03.900 --> 25:06.369
Nothing to hide from
each other, nothing to fear.

25:06.400 --> 25:07.731
Vampires couldn't touch us.

25:07.770 --> 25:11.070
- Yeah, but a pack would only
make us more dangerous.

25:11.110 --> 25:13.499
- Exactly! Invincible!

25:13.540 --> 25:15.030
Safe.

25:15.080 --> 25:18.607
- What we did last night
to those vampires,

25:18.650 --> 25:21.472
we--we never would
have done that alone.

25:21.520 --> 25:24.410
- They're murdering leeches, Josh.
- I don't care!

25:24.450 --> 25:26.589
I lost control.
I gave in to the wolf!

25:26.620 --> 25:28.418
Your wolf!

25:28.460 --> 25:31.885
I never want to
do that again.

25:33.660 --> 25:34.923
- All right.

25:35.630 --> 25:38.224
Maybe I pushed
you too far.

25:39.300 --> 25:40.768
We can take it slower.

25:40.800 --> 25:42.962
- I don't wanna
take it slower.

25:44.010 --> 25:45.466
(Sighing)

25:45.510 --> 25:48.605
I was gonna tell
you this tomorrow,

25:48.640 --> 25:50.642
after the moon...

25:52.680 --> 25:55.149
but I think it's time
you headed out.

26:02.290 --> 26:03.826
- You're joking.

26:04.860 --> 26:06.419
- No.

26:08.030 --> 26:10.328
Thank you.

26:10.360 --> 26:13.068
I'm grateful

26:13.100 --> 26:15.797
for everything that
you've taught me, but...

26:16.870 --> 26:18.235
I can manage.

26:18.270 --> 26:19.829
- You can't even
say "transform”

26:19.870 --> 26:21.770
without looking like
you're gonna puke.

26:21.810 --> 26:23.505
You keep on talking
about the wolf

26:23.540 --> 26:25.872
like it's some kind of
monster in a fairy tale,

26:25.910 --> 26:28.743
like it's not you!
- It isn't me!

26:28.780 --> 26:30.680
It's an infection,
a disease!

26:30.720 --> 26:32.347
- You don't
have to suffer!

26:32.390 --> 26:36.384
You don't have to be alone,
none of us do.

26:37.420 --> 26:39.081
- I...

26:39.130 --> 26:43.021
I think maybe changing together
isn't such a good idea.

26:43.060 --> 26:45.392
- What? Now you're gonna sulk?

26:45.430 --> 26:47.068
- You take the shed.
I'll find another place.

26:47.100 --> 26:48.067
- I won't abandon you

26:48.100 --> 26:50.239
while you're living
with that bloodmonger.

26:50.270 --> 26:52.534
Come on, Josh!
It's not safe.

26:54.440 --> 26:55.532
We protect each other.

26:55.580 --> 26:57.469
- No, we don't!
You make it worse for me.

26:57.510 --> 26:58.978
You make everything
worse for me.

26:59.010 --> 27:01.274
- You don't understand.

27:01.320 --> 27:04.483
I've been looking
for you for 2 years!

27:16.460 --> 27:17.859
- Two years?

27:28.110 --> 27:30.499
- I wanted to
tell you earlier.

27:33.450 --> 27:36.545
I'm the one you met
on that camping trip.

27:36.580 --> 27:38.412
- No.

27:39.720 --> 27:41.859
I'm the one
who turned you.

27:46.130 --> 27:48.997
I'm the one who
gave you this gift.

27:55.900 --> 27:57.368
- You can't be.

27:59.870 --> 28:03.909
- I was roaming
the forest in Maine.

28:05.750 --> 28:08.549
I attacked 2 backpackers.

28:09.880 --> 28:12.315
One of them died.

28:12.350 --> 28:16.958
And one was wounded,
a scratch on the shoulder.

28:16.990 --> 28:19.220
I checked the paper
for days after.

28:19.260 --> 28:20.682
I found your name.

28:20.730 --> 28:25.019
- You killed my friend!
- But you survived. You're the only one, Josh.

28:25.070 --> 28:26.799
I've been trying
to find you.

28:26.830 --> 28:28.229
I've been tracking
you ever since.

28:28.270 --> 28:30.693
- Why? Why?

28:30.740 --> 28:32.765
Why wouldn't you
just leave me alone?

28:32.810 --> 28:34.278
- I couldn't.

28:35.040 --> 28:37.077
Every time I closed my eyes,

28:37.110 --> 28:40.774
I saw you lying there
in the woods.

28:42.120 --> 28:43.815
I couldn't
stop thinking.

28:43.850 --> 28:47.787
I had to see what was your life like.
- My life?

28:47.820 --> 28:49.458
My life!

28:49.490 --> 28:52.528
I don't...
I don't have a life!

28:53.830 --> 28:56.492
My family, my fiance,

28:56.530 --> 28:58.726
my whole future...

29:04.070 --> 29:06.164
You should've..
You should've killed me.

29:06.210 --> 29:08.372
- No, don't say that.

29:08.410 --> 29:10.105
- Why didn't you?

29:10.140 --> 29:12.575
- There were voices,
screaming, men coming.

29:12.610 --> 29:15.079
You know how it is,
just flashes of memory.

29:26.490 --> 29:29.892
The wolf is a gift, Josh.

29:32.170 --> 29:35.834
I was just like you at first.
- This is not a gift!

29:35.870 --> 29:37.190
It's a curse!

29:37.240 --> 29:38.833
- Feel it! Feel it!

29:38.870 --> 29:41.202
We're faster and stronger
than any human.

29:41.240 --> 29:43.436
- I don't wanna be this!

29:43.480 --> 29:45.847
- We're more alive, Josh!

29:45.880 --> 29:47.917
We're the best of
human and animal.

29:47.950 --> 29:50.271
- All this time. All this time,
you've been coaching me,

29:50.320 --> 29:53.085
pretending to help me
manage my condition.

29:53.120 --> 29:55.179
And you're the one
who did this to me!

29:55.220 --> 29:59.157
What kind of sick freak are you?
- I'm your friend.

29:59.190 --> 30:01.625
- What do you
want from me?

30:01.660 --> 30:03.924
What do you want?

30:06.970 --> 30:09.689
- I thought if
I helped you...

30:11.140 --> 30:13.700
if you needed me,

30:13.740 --> 30:15.777
you'd let me in.

30:15.810 --> 30:17.972
- What are you
talking about?

30:18.850 --> 30:20.875
- I saw what you have:

30:20.920 --> 30:23.946
your house,
your friends, your job.

30:23.990 --> 30:25.685
I wanted that too.

30:25.720 --> 30:29.714
I wanted what
I used to have.

30:29.760 --> 30:35.756
I had a wife, a son. I
lost everything! (Gasping)

30:36.930 --> 30:39.297
- Ah!

30:44.110 --> 30:46.738
- Anyone you'd
like to pray for?

30:48.640 --> 30:52.247
You seem troubled.
I'll pray for you.

30:52.280 --> 30:54.817
- I've been doing this
for over 200 years.

30:54.850 --> 30:56.170
You've done it for 6.

30:56.220 --> 30:59.611
- Dammit, and you
still look 25.

30:59.650 --> 31:02.358
Sometimes I think: "If I'd
just turned a little earlier..."

31:02.390 --> 31:03.880
- I remember 6.

31:03.930 --> 31:06.524
You still
remember the faces

31:06.560 --> 31:07.721
of the people
that you've killed,

31:07.760 --> 31:09.353
most of them anyway.

31:09.400 --> 31:13.724
But they're just
starting to fade now,

31:13.770 --> 31:15.067
aren't they?

31:16.070 --> 31:17.936
(Sighing)

31:19.140 --> 31:24.306
I have killed
SO many people...

31:25.210 --> 31:28.077
that their faces
are a blur.

31:32.790 --> 31:38.752
I used to think that I would go crazy
trying to remember. But when you can't,

31:38.790 --> 31:42.852
when there's too many,
when it has been too long...

31:44.270 --> 31:45.920
that's when it gets scary.

31:45.970 --> 31:47.563
- Or liberating.

31:53.410 --> 31:55.572
I've seen people
come in here.

31:55.610 --> 32:00.446
They sit, pray.
They seem at peace.

32:00.480 --> 32:02.949
Church is
a sanctuary, right?

32:04.750 --> 32:08.482
Does it mean the same for
you now as before you turned?

32:11.390 --> 32:13.779
- When there's no one here,

32:13.830 --> 32:16.356
when it's empty...

32:17.860 --> 32:21.933
I can feel Him
here with me.

32:26.970 --> 32:31.407
- I've stopped... feeding.

32:32.410 --> 32:35.948
And this whole hospital,
I need it.

32:37.150 --> 32:42.554
I need a place to go
where we are not.

32:42.590 --> 32:46.629
- So you pick a place full of
bleeding bodies to go straight?

32:46.660 --> 32:50.654
- I can help people move on to
the death that I will never have.

32:50.700 --> 32:52.520
(Chuckling)

32:52.570 --> 32:54.789
- You're lying to yourself.

32:54.840 --> 32:57.730
If you wanna die, you could
end it anytime you want.

32:57.770 --> 32:59.260
We could do it right now.

33:38.310 --> 33:40.199
(Josh screaming)

33:42.020 --> 33:43.215
- That's it.

33:43.250 --> 33:44.411
(Screaming)

33:45.820 --> 33:48.312
Don't--don't fight it.

33:48.360 --> 33:51.990
Lean into it.
Let it take you.

33:52.030 --> 33:53.953
(Grunting)

33:56.200 --> 33:59.761
(Both roaring)

34:01.570 --> 34:05.700
- You want to live, and
that's OK. We all do.

34:05.740 --> 34:07.868
God intended for us
to live forever.

34:07.910 --> 34:10.208
Adam and Eve were immortal
before the Fall.

34:10.239 --> 34:12.208
It's our natural state.

34:12.250 --> 34:15.413
"T am the resurrection
and the life.

34:15.449 --> 34:18.010
"He who believes
in me will live,

34:18.050 --> 34:19.313
"even though he dies."

34:19.350 --> 34:23.389
- I get it.
You're completely unhinged.

34:33.770 --> 34:37.092
** Electronic, medicated *

34:37.139 --> 34:40.860
* Superficially *

34:42.080 --> 34:45.902
* Sentimental, liquidated *

34:45.949 --> 34:50.376
* Parasitic, suddenly... *

34:50.420 --> 34:52.047
- Ah!

34:52.090 --> 34:54.956
* They stole my generation *

34:54.989 --> 34:59.587
* I've got imagination *

34:59.630 --> 35:03.294
* Let me give my expectations *

35:03.330 --> 35:05.719
* It's all a hallucination... *

35:05.770 --> 35:07.693
(Growling)

35:12.410 --> 35:14.902
(Both growling)

35:22.480 --> 35:23.948
- No more.

35:23.980 --> 35:25.288
No more.

35:25.320 --> 35:27.789
- Ah! Ah!

35:28.890 --> 35:31.928
* And you may do fine **

35:46.340 --> 35:48.707
(Birds chirping)

36:02.360 --> 36:04.283
- The first time
we met...

36:05.330 --> 36:07.651
I don't blame you.

36:07.690 --> 36:09.351
You had no control.

36:09.400 --> 36:11.789
You didn't know
what you were doing.

36:13.430 --> 36:15.694
But the second...

36:17.070 --> 36:18.959
you should have
stayed away.

36:19.010 --> 36:21.035
- All I wanted was
to find the last person

36:21.070 --> 36:22.572
I had a connection with.

36:22.610 --> 36:26.103
- The connection of a murderer
to the man he's killed?

36:26.150 --> 36:28.414
- You don't know
what it's like.

36:28.450 --> 36:31.886
I've been so
lonely for years.

36:31.920 --> 36:35.049
- You expect me to
feel sorry for you?

36:35.090 --> 36:37.684
- You think you're
better than me?

36:37.720 --> 36:43.591
You think you won't do what I've done?
- I'm not like you, Ray.

36:43.630 --> 36:47.021
- The wolf is you,
and you are the wolf,

36:47.070 --> 36:49.038
The only difference
between you and me

36:49.070 --> 36:50.560
is that I know what I am.

36:50.600 --> 36:52.659
I accept it.

36:53.710 --> 36:57.203
- And I never will.
- Give it a few years,

36:57.240 --> 37:01.245
or 5, or 10.

37:02.750 --> 37:05.583
This is it, Josh.

37:06.590 --> 37:09.082
It's a life
sentence, brother.

37:15.630 --> 37:18.190
One day, you'll know
what it's like,

37:18.230 --> 37:21.530
everything I'm saying,
and you'll come looking for me!

37:21.570 --> 37:22.799
Josh!

37:23.870 --> 37:26.601
Josh!

37:27.540 --> 37:29.406
JOSH!

37:29.440 --> 37:33.070
**I'm just a
piece of light... *

37:33.110 --> 37:35.511
- Who did this?

37:35.550 --> 37:38.918
- Your psychotic protg.

37:38.950 --> 37:40.645
- Aidan?

37:41.660 --> 37:43.412
- Fix me.

37:43.460 --> 37:45.781
- Shhh...

37:46.730 --> 37:49.028
- Aidan can be
an animal.

37:50.430 --> 37:53.991
I'm sorry. Living is the
one flaw in our evolution.

37:55.200 --> 37:57.396
Fangs don't grow back.

37:58.610 --> 38:01.409
- Wha-what am I gonna do?

38:01.440 --> 38:04.273
How am I gonna eat?
- Shhh, shhh, shhh...

38:04.310 --> 38:07.575
I told you, we are a family.
We'll take care of you.

38:10.350 --> 38:11.943
- I...

38:12.690 --> 38:14.613
How will I survive?

38:15.720 --> 38:19.782
*I'm just a piece of light *

38:26.170 --> 38:31.062
* I can't wait
to be yours tonight *

38:33.540 --> 38:36.009
- My God!

38:38.610 --> 38:40.100
- (Danny):
Oh man...

38:40.150 --> 38:41.572
- Did you leave
the door unlocked?

38:41.620 --> 38:43.418
- What? Are you kidding me?

38:44.950 --> 38:46.588
- I can't believe this.

38:46.620 --> 38:47.883
- Just...

38:50.360 --> 38:52.055
Oh God!

38:52.090 --> 38:56.254
* Just say you'll be more... *

39:02.070 --> 39:03.731
Oh no...

39:11.580 --> 39:12.809
Oh...

39:14.720 --> 39:16.711
- How'd that get there?

39:19.050 --> 39:22.588
* Is there a place for me... *

39:24.490 --> 39:27.528
- I'm gonna check the bedroom.
- No, wait.

39:27.560 --> 39:29.892
What if they're still here?
You should call the police.

39:31.300 --> 39:34.793
* Is there a place for me *

39:38.670 --> 39:41.332
* In your eyes? **

39:47.350 --> 39:50.217
(Man speaking on phone,
indistinct)

40:22.220 --> 40:24.075
(Horn honking)

40:25.190 --> 40:27.079
- You guys coming?

40:28.290 --> 40:29.849
Dinner.

40:42.970 --> 40:44.802
OK...

40:44.840 --> 40:47.366
- Whoa!

40:47.410 --> 40:51.335
- You remember that neither
of us actually eats, right?

40:51.380 --> 40:52.779
- Well, fake it,
you know?

40:52.810 --> 40:55.211
Do what all the anorexic girls
in my high school used to do.

40:55.250 --> 40:57.969
Push your food around, nibble,
pretend to chew, whatever.

40:58.020 --> 41:04.357
I don't care. We are all sitting down
to a hot, delicious meal together.

41:04.390 --> 41:05.926
- OK.

41:05.960 --> 41:07.280
- OK...

41:07.330 --> 41:09.890
We have to hang on to
some rituals of normalcy.

41:26.150 --> 41:28.403
- Mmm!

41:28.450 --> 41:32.182
Divine.
(Both laughing)

41:32.220 --> 41:33.710
- Thank you.

41:35.890 --> 41:37.915
See?
(Laughing)

41:37.960 --> 41:40.850
This is nice.
It's been...

41:40.890 --> 41:44.497
well, never since we all
shared a meal together.

41:44.530 --> 41:47.170
- You're right!
Thanks, Mom.

41:55.440 --> 41:57.579
- Aidan told me.

41:59.680 --> 42:01.717
I'm so sorry.
Do you--

42:01.750 --> 42:03.240
- There's nothing
more to say.

42:08.020 --> 42:11.888
- Aidan...
(Clearing throat)

42:11.930 --> 42:16.254
How was work? I didn't
see you on the shift today.

42:20.800 --> 42:22.290
OK then.

42:24.300 --> 42:27.201
- So, what happened
with Ray?

42:29.940 --> 42:32.341
- Ray's gone.

42:32.380 --> 42:35.372
- And the other night,
those, uh,

42:35.420 --> 42:37.912
degenerates you rolled?

42:37.950 --> 42:40.317
- That's gone too.

42:47.230 --> 42:48.959
Oh!

42:49.000 --> 42:50.889
Fun tidbit.

42:50.930 --> 42:54.025
Turns out that Ray...

42:54.070 --> 42:57.665
is the one that
did this to me.

42:59.140 --> 43:01.700
He made me what I am.

43:03.510 --> 43:04.580
- You're kidding.

43:05.680 --> 43:07.170
- Are you OK?

43:07.210 --> 43:11.010
- Oh yeah, I'm awesome.
I'm incredible.

43:11.050 --> 43:12.814
I mean, who wouldn't
wanna meet their were-dad?

43:12.850 --> 43:14.909
(Laughing)

43:14.960 --> 43:16.815
Could you pass
the salad, please?

43:20.690 --> 43:24.900
** Isn't it strange *

43:24.930 --> 43:27.729
* These laws of attraction? *

43:27.770 --> 43:30.569
* Let me be the one
you rearrange *

43:30.600 --> 43:33.433
* Let's start
a chain reaction *

43:33.470 --> 43:36.906
* We will know
time will tell *

43:36.940 --> 43:38.578
* Just like the tides *

43:38.610 --> 43:41.204
* They ebb and flow **
