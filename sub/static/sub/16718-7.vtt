WEBVTT

00:16.520 --> 00:18.160
Have you ever talked to him?

00:18.360 --> 00:19.720
Yes, but he just dismissed it.

00:19.880 --> 00:21.440
Stop when you say his
hands were shaking...

00:22.280 --> 00:23.600
I just want to understand
what happened.

00:23.720 --> 00:26.200
I tell you, with Dr.
Guthrie is something.

00:26.360 --> 00:27.720
His hands are always shaking.

00:27.840 --> 00:29.360
His medical records
are illegible and...

00:29.480 --> 00:30.560
What's up, Breakfast Club?

00:31.280 --> 00:32.400
Have you seen any news?

00:32.800 --> 00:35.680
Again over 30
prisoners were injured

00:35.800 --> 00:38.160
in a riot in a California
federal prison.

00:38.480 --> 00:40.240
These prisoners
are being taken to

00:40.360 --> 00:41.480
hospitals in the
south of the country...

00:41.600 --> 00:43.000
Let's go guys.  We get patients.

00:43.120 --> 00:44.080
Where's willis

00:44.200 --> 00:45.560
He called in sick
today.  Let's go.

00:51.240 --> 00:52.960
Good to see you again, Ethan.
Thank you for being there.

00:53.960 --> 00:56.600
The NCOs who woke
me gave me no choice.

00:56.720 --> 00:57.680
What's happening?

00:58.680 --> 01:02.680
At 0600 today a B-586
Kronshtadt, Varshavyanka,

01:02.800 --> 01:06.560
one hundred and thirty
kilometers off the coast of L.A.

01:07.360 --> 01:08.600
An explosion in the engine room.

01:08.840 --> 01:11.560
A Russian hunting submarine
showed up in US waters?

01:11.680 --> 01:13.400
The next Russian
ship is three days away.

01:14.040 --> 01:17.120
We are not allowed to bring
them ashore or rescue the injured.

01:17.400 --> 01:19.640
I'm not supposed to make a house call

01:19.800 --> 01:22.560
on a Russian
submarine spying on us?

01:22.680 --> 01:24.480
I have a better idea.
Why don't you blow it up?

01:25.760 --> 01:27.040
Somebody made an
exchange, and what it entails

01:27.160 --> 01:28.960
must be important,
otherwise would have

01:29.080 --> 01:30.560
the Department of
Defense disagreed.

01:30.920 --> 01:31.880
Why me?

01:32.480 --> 01:33.680
You were asked directly.

01:33.800 --> 01:34.760
From the Pentagon?

01:34.880 --> 01:35.840
From the Russians.

01:35.960 --> 01:39.160
From the chief doctor on board.
Dr.  Dmitri Volkov.

01:40.280 --> 01:41.240
Dmitri...

01:42.000 --> 01:43.320
We were in Afghanistan together.

01:50.280 --> 01:51.240
What is he doing here?

01:51.360 --> 01:54.200
According to the White House, it
should look like a civilian mission.

01:54.520 --> 01:56.240
For that we need
a real civilian.

01:56.480 --> 01:57.680
He's the wrong guy for that.

01:58.560 --> 01:59.720
He doesn't have the temperament.

01:59.840 --> 02:02.400
No wonder you don't like him,
he's supposed to be your boss.

02:03.440 --> 02:05.120
Ethan, listen.

02:05.600 --> 02:07.800
The importance of this matter
has often been emphasized.

02:07.960 --> 02:09.600
You gotta keep Malinovsky alive

02:10.080 --> 02:11.800
and you won't get
any help from us.

02:12.240 --> 02:13.560
There is only you
and your friend.

02:15.960 --> 02:18.160
CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON ARWTN

02:19.680 --> 02:20.840
Come on, move.

02:21.120 --> 02:22.520
They are violent criminals.

02:22.640 --> 02:23.640
So keep calm.

02:23.760 --> 02:25.000
How fitting that
Campbell is not there.

02:25.120 --> 02:28.120
Fifty-four year old with stab
wounds on the upper body.

02:28.240 --> 02:29.320
The knives are still in place.

02:29.440 --> 02:30.920
Here I have a VIP for you.

02:31.040 --> 02:32.440
Please tell us
about his injuries?

02:32.560 --> 02:35.320
A couple of stab wounds
and his hand is in the bucket.

02:35.440 --> 02:36.560
I'll cut you open, Jackie.

02:36.680 --> 02:38.720
The third time this week
that he wants to do that.

02:39.080 --> 02:40.760
Lovely.  Let's take him
to the Center Stage.

02:40.880 --> 02:42.000
Hey watch out.  Take care.

02:46.160 --> 02:47.640
This went through the fascia.

02:47.960 --> 02:49.280
We're doing a FAST scan.

02:49.480 --> 02:50.560
Yes doctor

02:51.960 --> 02:52.920
What the hell is that?

02:53.040 --> 02:54.520
Sir, please hold still.

02:55.120 --> 02:57.280
"Sir"?  That bitch is a
lot nicer than you, Jacks.

02:57.920 --> 02:59.240
Don't rely on it.

03:01.880 --> 03:04.760
That drawer there
is full of scalpels that

03:04.880 --> 03:06.240
can neatly sever your
arm and other things.

03:06.360 --> 03:07.880
-Let go!
-Come.

03:09.960 --> 03:10.920
Would you like haloperidol?

03:11.040 --> 03:12.720
In any case.
And diphenhydramine.

03:13.080 --> 03:15.560
Jackie, handcuff your
hands by your sides.

03:15.680 --> 03:17.160
That way he can't
squirm so much.

03:19.080 --> 03:20.040
Put them on.

03:22.360 --> 03:23.960
I'll finish what I started

03:24.080 --> 03:25.320
"Black Deaths Matter," Sonny.

03:26.560 --> 03:28.560
I'm trembling with fear, Damien.

03:29.560 --> 03:31.400
Careful, this could be
the artery.  Ultrasonic.

03:32.720 --> 03:33.680
A toothbrush?

03:33.800 --> 03:35.200
He also caught me with a spoon.

03:36.600 --> 03:38.680
He's always a little
irritable around me.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.440
I don't see why.

03:40.640 --> 03:42.280
-Hey, hey.
-Fix it.  Right away.

03:46.360 --> 03:47.680
We need leg fixations.

03:47.800 --> 03:49.960
Please back.  Easy, easy.

03:51.680 --> 03:53.320
The pupils are 5 mm
in size and sluggish.

03:53.440 --> 03:54.600
It has to go to the CT first.

03:54.720 --> 03:55.680
Is that hank?

03:57.000 --> 03:58.640
Man are you alright

03:58.880 --> 04:00.600
I wanted to pull
it out, but it fell.

04:01.360 --> 04:03.440
Everyone was on it.

04:03.560 --> 04:04.920
A boot hit his forehead.

04:05.240 --> 04:06.400
He cramps!

04:06.560 --> 04:07.520
I'll get trepanation tools.

04:07.640 --> 04:08.600
No, this is an open break.

04:08.720 --> 04:10.400
We can remove the
bone through the skin,

04:10.520 --> 04:11.800
that will take the
pressure off his brain.

04:11.920 --> 04:13.360
Please give me a bone lifter.

04:16.200 --> 04:17.800
The stuff is to my liking.

04:17.920 --> 04:19.680
That'll keep you silent
for a while, buddy.

04:19.800 --> 04:22.320
Wait, it seems like
something is under the skin.

04:24.920 --> 04:25.880
Is this...

04:26.000 --> 04:26.960
A tooth.

04:27.080 --> 04:29.200
Yes, it belongs to me.

04:29.320 --> 04:30.560
Call the dental surgery.

04:39.280 --> 04:40.400
Is there a problem Dr.  Pineda?

04:40.760 --> 04:41.720
No.

04:41.960 --> 04:42.920
Good.

04:46.320 --> 04:48.800
Vessels are intact.  A
lung may have collapsed.

04:48.920 --> 04:49.880
Prepare the chest tube.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.680
Do we get another watch?
This will hurt.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.080
Don't worry about Sonny.

04:53.200 --> 04:54.680
Yeah, don't worry about Sonny.

05:00.600 --> 05:02.120
It didn't even
get to the muscle.

05:02.240 --> 05:04.400
-Only slight tissue damage.
-Such lucky guy.

05:04.560 --> 05:06.560
Yes, being fat finally
seems to be worth it.

05:07.120 --> 05:08.560
Look, he's a teddy bear.

05:12.320 --> 05:14.360
Jackie.  Is that your blood

05:18.240 --> 05:19.200
OK.

05:19.360 --> 05:21.680
He should go to the edge
until the operating room is ready.

05:27.600 --> 05:28.840
We'll be there in a minute.

05:28.960 --> 05:30.000
Have you wondered
how you got into

05:30.120 --> 05:32.800
an important
international negotiation?

05:33.080 --> 05:34.400
No, I only ask
myself that about you.

05:35.440 --> 05:36.800
Maybe it's because I'm the best.

05:38.920 --> 05:40.360
Who is this Dr.  Volkov?

05:40.480 --> 05:43.400
A military surgeon.
We were both in Afghanistan.

05:43.520 --> 05:45.600
-Good doctor.
Then why does he need us?

05:46.000 --> 05:47.760
I've asked myself
about that often.

05:48.520 --> 05:50.120
Don't mess with these people.

05:50.240 --> 05:53.000
3 years ago a submarine
sank in the Bering Strait,

05:53.120 --> 05:54.960
the Russians did not
allow a US rescue ship near.

05:56.440 --> 05:59.040
Anatoly Malinovsky must
be very important to Putin.

05:59.160 --> 06:00.920
30 seconds to the goal.

06:03.440 --> 06:04.560
There she is...

06:05.000 --> 06:06.200
The Varshavyanka.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.040
Push with your
right hand to brake.

06:18.160 --> 06:19.400
Don't jump, just sit back.

06:19.640 --> 06:20.680
What if i jump?

06:20.840 --> 06:22.160
You could lose your head.

06:40.880 --> 06:42.320
Request permission
to come on board, sir.

06:42.840 --> 06:44.440
I am Captain Vasilievsky.

06:44.800 --> 06:46.320
Welcome to the Varshavyanka.

07:01.400 --> 07:02.360
Where's Volkov?

07:04.400 --> 07:06.800
You only care about
the task discussed.

07:07.080 --> 07:09.440
You only stay within
the marked area.

07:09.680 --> 07:11.920
There are consequences
if this is not heeded.

07:12.880 --> 07:15.560
There was an explosion
in the lower engine room.

07:15.680 --> 07:16.640
Not nuclear.

07:17.160 --> 07:20.200
Lt.  Malinovsky worked in
the galley and was injured.

07:25.520 --> 07:26.480
Here he is.

07:29.480 --> 07:30.840
But where is Dr.  Volkov?

07:31.320 --> 07:32.720
Thanks for being there, Ethan.

07:33.840 --> 07:34.800
Dmitri,

07:35.160 --> 07:36.480
I wasn't told that
you were hurt.

07:37.320 --> 07:38.640
The main thing is that
you don't have to work.

07:38.760 --> 07:40.480
Tell him Malinovsky
is a priority.

07:40.680 --> 07:41.640
I am fine.

07:41.760 --> 07:44.440
Probably a Galeazzi fracture
and one or two broken ribs.

07:44.560 --> 07:46.000
Take care of him,
we're in a hurry.

07:51.400 --> 07:52.960
Sternoclavicular dislocation.

07:54.240 --> 07:55.440
It's not in good shape.

08:02.840 --> 08:04.080
Can you roll up
your sleeves, please?

08:04.240 --> 08:05.200
Yes.

08:06.160 --> 08:08.120
I am only writing to
my daughter Molly.

08:08.240 --> 08:10.120
When she sees the
news she gets scared.

08:10.840 --> 08:11.800
Can I introduce myself.

08:11.920 --> 08:13.080
You don't get scared
easily, do you?

08:13.200 --> 08:14.840
Otherwise I couldn't do the job.

08:15.680 --> 08:16.960
Why didn't you say
anything about the injury?

08:17.880 --> 08:19.400
To show weakness to these guys

08:20.000 --> 08:20.960
is a death sentence.

08:21.320 --> 08:24.200
You just became my soul mate.

08:25.600 --> 08:28.280
Miss seams on your soulmate.

08:28.400 --> 08:29.360
I'm there.

08:33.120 --> 08:34.679
Do you need to be strong here too?

08:35.240 --> 08:36.200
Sometimes.

08:39.280 --> 08:42.400
Molly wants me to
see her play tomorrow.

08:43.280 --> 08:45.240
She plays Julia
in middle school.

08:46.600 --> 08:48.360
As a child, I also played
along with a piece.

08:48.760 --> 08:50.720
I was a tree and
I had no dialogue.

08:51.440 --> 08:53.200
But my mom was
there at every gig.

08:54.320 --> 08:55.960
That's what matters.

08:57.120 --> 08:59.640
Tell your daughter
that you will come.

09:06.120 --> 09:08.560
There's someone here named Linda.
She says she knows you.

09:13.080 --> 09:14.360
She was my father's friend.

09:15.800 --> 09:16.760
Thank you.

09:20.080 --> 09:21.320
-Mario.
-Here's the check.

09:23.480 --> 09:24.440
Thank you.

09:25.520 --> 09:26.800
I think you should come.

09:27.160 --> 09:28.960
You got what you
wanted  I've had enough.

09:31.680 --> 09:33.520
I'll stay here
until it's time to go

09:34.840 --> 09:35.880
In case you make up your mind

09:36.000 --> 09:37.760
I have patients.  You should go

09:41.680 --> 09:42.960
Why did he attack you?

09:43.080 --> 09:45.840
Damien skinheads
have always targeted us.

09:46.040 --> 09:47.440
But you should have seen Sonny.

09:47.560 --> 09:48.840
He wanted to finish them all.

09:50.080 --> 09:51.440
He really saved my ass.

09:51.560 --> 09:52.560
You would have
flattened them all.

09:52.800 --> 09:53.800
Yes exactly.

09:54.560 --> 09:56.080
No pneumothorax
on his chest x-ray.

09:56.200 --> 09:57.880
Sew it up further,
and then out with it.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.280
What about his tooth?

09:59.400 --> 10:01.760
The dentist says he'll see
him at the clinic tomorrow.

10:01.960 --> 10:03.360
I thought it was called
one patient per room.

10:04.120 --> 10:05.640
Jackie said it was okay, doc.

10:06.120 --> 10:07.320
Arlo and I are great friends.

10:07.600 --> 10:09.440
He can't get along without me.

10:09.800 --> 10:10.760
Or?

10:13.160 --> 10:14.120
What's happening?

10:14.240 --> 10:15.720
-He's not got a pulse.
- Cardiac arrest.

10:15.840 --> 10:17.760
Do something!
Aren't you helping him?

10:19.880 --> 10:21.040
-Loading.
-Sonny.

10:21.160 --> 10:22.360
Back.

10:22.640 --> 10:23.720
Hold on.

10:26.800 --> 10:27.760
Check.

10:29.560 --> 10:30.520
Sine.

10:31.680 --> 10:32.880
What the hell just happened?

10:33.000 --> 10:33.960
His heart stopped.

10:34.200 --> 10:36.520
They said the stab
wounds weren't that bad.

10:36.840 --> 10:37.800
They weren't either.

10:47.440 --> 10:49.520
His collarbone shifted back
away from the breastbone.

10:49.640 --> 10:51.400
It pushes into the aorta.
It will collapse.

10:51.800 --> 10:52.960
Where's your lidocaine?

10:53.640 --> 10:55.440
At the top.  It says...

10:57.120 --> 10:58.440
The blood pressure drops rapidly.
He collapses.

10:58.560 --> 11:00.200
We have to do it now.
We need a towel clamp.

11:00.320 --> 11:01.640
Look in the closet over there.

11:03.120 --> 11:04.480
Either you and your men go away.

11:06.760 --> 11:07.720
Or not.

11:08.760 --> 11:10.520
Systolic blood
pressure is down to 34.

11:14.040 --> 11:15.880
You can fix it right now.

11:28.000 --> 11:28.960
Quiet, we want to help you.

11:29.080 --> 11:30.480
That must have been a big blast.

11:30.840 --> 11:31.800
Were the others hurt?

11:31.920 --> 11:33.880
No other injured person.
Fix that.

11:34.920 --> 11:35.880
Come on, you can do it.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.720
It's moving, but I
need more strength.

11:37.960 --> 11:38.960
Do something inside.

11:39.080 --> 11:40.040
Pull sideways.

11:40.320 --> 11:41.280
Hey come over here.

11:42.160 --> 11:43.320
Hold him.  Press down.

11:43.440 --> 11:44.400
Downward.

11:47.640 --> 11:49.240
Sailor, I'm very sorry.

11:49.360 --> 11:50.320
Ready?

11:50.440 --> 11:52.520
One two Three.

11:54.640 --> 11:56.000
It's Damien.

11:57.160 --> 11:58.280
-OK.
-He's having a fit.

11:58.400 --> 11:59.760
Give him two units of lorazepam.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.680
Are you taking the
handcuffs off so he lies flat?

12:01.800 --> 12:02.760
No way.

12:02.880 --> 12:03.960
We have to protect its airways.

12:04.680 --> 12:05.680
He breaks his wrist.

12:05.800 --> 12:06.760
A handcuff?

12:09.000 --> 12:09.960
You're welcome.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.240
OK.

12:20.760 --> 12:21.720
Got it.

12:23.720 --> 12:24.680
He's slowing down.

12:24.800 --> 12:26.160
He'll need a head CT.

12:26.560 --> 12:28.600
The seizures could be
from a brain hemorrhage.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.880
Jesse, add 1 gram of phenytoin.

12:31.000 --> 12:31.960
All right.

12:32.080 --> 12:33.480
Please call radiology.

12:33.600 --> 12:34.560
Let them know we're coming.

12:34.680 --> 12:36.680
We should clear the path
before it goes anywhere.

12:36.920 --> 12:37.920
-And off.
-All right then.

12:40.440 --> 12:42.400
I need a unit for an evacuation.

12:44.760 --> 12:47.520
What do you have to
do here to get morphine?

12:47.960 --> 12:49.960
Go ahead, you have
a bad skull fracture.

12:50.800 --> 12:52.920
Then get me ondansetron
before I throw up.

12:53.320 --> 12:54.880
Or metoclopramide.
The dealer decides.

12:55.160 --> 12:56.120
Are you a doctor?

12:56.240 --> 12:57.440
Don't you recognize me?

12:58.120 --> 12:59.960
Should I be relieved
or offended now?

13:00.400 --> 13:03.040
Malaya, this is Hank Goldman.

13:03.160 --> 13:04.440
The "doctor of the stars."

13:04.840 --> 13:07.960
Yes, I read about
you a few years ago.

13:08.840 --> 13:11.200
But you know me from
somewhere else, don't you, Rollie?

13:11.480 --> 13:12.680
Hank was my intern.

13:12.800 --> 13:14.160
It was a long time ago.

13:14.280 --> 13:15.320
He was a very good doctor.

13:16.560 --> 13:19.960
He's had a lucrative
career with narcotics.

13:20.480 --> 13:21.640
Until someone died.

13:21.840 --> 13:24.520
Have you never given someone

13:24.640 --> 13:25.800
with a deep cut an extra patch?

13:25.920 --> 13:27.160
That was all I wanted.

13:27.640 --> 13:31.240
The courts called your
act negligent homicide.

13:32.560 --> 13:34.720
You're still the old man, Guthrie.
Always compliant.

13:34.840 --> 13:36.680
I am not surprised
that you work here.

13:36.840 --> 13:38.240
How much do you earn?
Twelve dollars an hour?

13:38.360 --> 13:40.160
I heard Denny's pay 15.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.440
You distracted from
the essentials, Rollie.

13:49.160 --> 13:52.760
Multiple intraparenchymal
and intraventricular bleeding.

13:52.880 --> 13:54.880
We have already asked
neurosurgery for advice.

13:55.240 --> 13:56.200
Don't bother.

13:57.600 --> 13:58.880
I know how to read a CT.

14:00.720 --> 14:01.680
It's over with me.

14:02.160 --> 14:04.640
I'm very sorry, Hank.

14:04.960 --> 14:07.000
Shall we let someone know?

14:07.840 --> 14:08.800
My wife.

14:09.320 --> 14:11.080
But not by collect call,
she does not accept that.

14:12.480 --> 14:14.440
Since when have your hands
been shaking like that, Rollie?

14:17.040 --> 14:18.000
I tell you what...

14:20.640 --> 14:23.760
Today you are the patient
and I am your doctor, yes?

14:38.040 --> 14:39.200
Why does it take so long?

14:39.320 --> 14:40.600
The cut is very big.

14:41.640 --> 14:43.040
It shouldn't be long now.

14:56.480 --> 14:57.680
I'll be back soon.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.320
Dr.  Volkov is in charge.

14:59.440 --> 15:00.560
And they stay here.

15:04.480 --> 15:05.640
I think the boss likes me.

15:05.960 --> 15:07.480
Maybe they'll
meet up to play golf.

15:07.760 --> 15:09.760
Last time I almost died.

15:09.920 --> 15:11.680
And you should be
careful, comrade.

15:12.240 --> 15:14.360
There is no court
martial in my homeland

15:14.720 --> 15:15.680
one is shot there.

15:17.840 --> 15:21.000
How often did he stand
before the court martial anyway?

15:21.640 --> 15:23.400
I think only once.

15:26.680 --> 15:27.920
That was a joke.

15:29.840 --> 15:31.360
The fun never stops with you.

15:31.480 --> 15:33.120
Yes, I stood before
the court martial

15:34.000 --> 15:35.360
but in the end I was acquitted.

15:38.360 --> 15:40.400
You need more
suturing for this wound.

15:40.520 --> 15:42.320
No, I think that's fine.

15:42.680 --> 15:43.640
No.

15:43.800 --> 15:45.600
It requires a multi-layer seam.

15:46.480 --> 15:48.800
Ethan, I still have
thread in my cabin.

15:54.360 --> 15:56.120
-Rather play it safe, right?
-Yes.

16:03.280 --> 16:05.240
It's a long way to
get to his quarters.

16:06.080 --> 16:07.080
I'm just saying it.

16:19.360 --> 16:21.080
Jesse, Radiology
is ready for Damien.

16:25.480 --> 16:26.440
He is gone.

16:28.480 --> 16:29.440
Leanne.

16:30.600 --> 16:31.960
Damien got Jackie.

16:39.160 --> 16:40.120
Jackie?

16:40.240 --> 16:41.480
Damien caught Jackie!

16:44.360 --> 16:46.040
I need compresses, please.

16:47.600 --> 16:48.920
She has to go to the Center Stage.

16:49.040 --> 16:50.000
Get some guards here.

16:50.160 --> 16:51.360
A prisoner is on the run.

17:02.560 --> 17:03.520
I need more compresses.

17:03.640 --> 17:04.599
Compresses, compresses.

17:04.720 --> 17:06.440
Let's get her to the operating room.
We have to get her up.

17:07.520 --> 17:09.079
Savetti, Pinkney, over here.

17:09.760 --> 17:10.800
My god, Jackie.

17:11.040 --> 17:12.000
Damien did it, right?

17:12.119 --> 17:13.480
-Where is he?
-The guards will take care.

17:13.599 --> 17:15.079
Now we have to
stop this bleeding first.

17:15.200 --> 17:18.280
There is a lockdown!  Nobody
leaves until Damien is found.

17:18.520 --> 17:20.079
But we have to, she needs
an operation immediately!

17:20.200 --> 17:22.440
That doesn't work,
nobody comes or goes.

17:22.560 --> 17:23.680
There are no surgeons down here!

17:23.800 --> 17:24.760
They are not leaving!

17:24.880 --> 17:26.680
You are a surgeon!
You have to operate on them.

17:26.800 --> 17:28.040
Let's take them to
the Center Stage.

17:28.160 --> 17:29.120
Come on guys.  I said move.

17:29.640 --> 17:31.080
-Does she have a pulse?
-You lost a lot of blood.

17:31.200 --> 17:32.720
Noa, prepare the intubation set.

17:32.840 --> 17:34.200
Arterial clamp
and vascular loop!

17:34.320 --> 17:35.280
Come immediately.

17:35.400 --> 17:36.880
I need 16 thread.

17:37.000 --> 17:37.960
Watch out!

17:38.600 --> 17:39.960
Open rapid infusion, please.

17:40.080 --> 17:41.720
Understood.  Blood is running.

17:42.000 --> 17:42.960
Are you in?

17:43.120 --> 17:44.760
Let's get away from there.

17:44.880 --> 17:46.040
Attention.  Concentration.

17:46.160 --> 17:48.360
Everyone, focus!
We have to treat someone.

17:58.240 --> 17:59.440
A call from Molly.

18:00.880 --> 18:02.040
Her daughter.

18:04.160 --> 18:06.040
Where's your cabin?

18:06.280 --> 18:07.240
Moscow?

18:07.600 --> 18:08.560
He comes again.

18:09.840 --> 18:11.240
When it all happened

18:12.760 --> 18:14.320
you asked directly about Willis.

18:15.640 --> 18:16.600
How so?

18:16.720 --> 18:18.480
During all my
years in Afghanistan

18:18.840 --> 18:20.800
I worked with many
American doctors.

18:21.400 --> 18:23.000
Willis is the only one I like.

18:23.640 --> 18:24.720
Do you know why?

18:26.080 --> 18:27.080
I can not imagine that.

18:27.480 --> 18:28.760
His respect for rules.

18:30.200 --> 18:31.960
Willis has no respect for rules.

18:32.160 --> 18:33.360
Right.

18:36.640 --> 18:37.880
He's still alive, thank God.

18:38.000 --> 18:38.960
Barely.

18:43.120 --> 18:44.080
Who the hell is that?

18:44.200 --> 18:45.920
Sergeant Sergei Ivanov.

18:46.040 --> 18:47.480
He was injured in the explosion.

18:47.600 --> 18:49.600
He has a shear injury from
fragments in his stomach.

18:49.720 --> 18:50.880
Heavy bleeding.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.680
I asked if there were
any other casualties.

18:52.800 --> 18:54.880
According to the captain, only
Malinovsky should be treated.

18:59.920 --> 19:01.920
So does he let
everyone else die?

19:02.080 --> 19:03.040
I said yes.

19:03.720 --> 19:06.240
Fine, prepare him
for an abdominal cut.

19:10.520 --> 19:11.480
What are they saying?

19:11.600 --> 19:12.560
I need a laryngoscope.

19:15.160 --> 19:16.320
You will have to shoot me.

19:32.720 --> 19:34.240
You know he still
has his gun, don't you?

19:34.760 --> 19:35.880
Yes, I noticed.

19:38.720 --> 19:41.040
The carotid on the right
is torn, worse than the left.

19:41.160 --> 19:42.240
She's bleeding through the seam.

19:42.360 --> 19:43.400
We are at 32 minutes.

19:43.520 --> 19:44.480
I know.

19:44.600 --> 19:45.560
I need more vicryl.

19:46.920 --> 19:49.320
Come on!  Molly needs
you at her play tomorrow.

19:49.440 --> 19:50.400
OK?

19:54.040 --> 19:55.200
How many units?

19:55.720 --> 19:56.680
This is the eighth.

19:59.280 --> 20:00.440
- Still nothing.
-Damn it.

20:00.560 --> 20:01.960
Mario, take over
the resuscitation.

20:02.080 --> 20:03.040
Heather...

20:03.160 --> 20:04.360
No ok  I promised her.

20:07.920 --> 20:08.880
Dr.  Pinkney.

20:12.920 --> 20:14.920
Time of death 2:45 p.m.

20:18.320 --> 20:20.040
-We have to tell the family.
-I'll do it.

20:21.120 --> 20:22.440
-I can...
-I said I'll do this.

20:23.120 --> 20:24.280
Dr.  Pinkney.

20:38.240 --> 20:39.200
Hank?

20:39.320 --> 20:40.280
Ruth...

20:40.840 --> 20:42.040
Did you really call her?

20:42.880 --> 20:44.920
Ruth, you haven't
changed at all.

20:45.480 --> 20:46.640
Don't look closely.

20:47.080 --> 20:48.280
I am surprised
that you are there.

20:48.400 --> 20:49.600
I didn't come to visit you.

20:49.720 --> 20:51.720
I came for you to sign this.

20:52.400 --> 20:53.520
Right.  Naturally.

20:54.280 --> 20:56.920
She always sends me
forms, we're not divorced yet.

20:57.040 --> 20:58.560
That's bad, even for you.

20:59.000 --> 20:59.960
Bad?

21:00.680 --> 21:01.840
We lost our home.

21:02.840 --> 21:04.880
Our children had
to change schools.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.280
We lost our friends...

21:06.720 --> 21:07.680
We lost everything.

21:07.800 --> 21:10.480
The minimum is that
you sign these papers.

21:11.080 --> 21:12.760
I didn't want all
of this to happen.

21:13.360 --> 21:14.680
How many times can I apologize?

21:14.800 --> 21:15.760
Not often enough.

21:17.160 --> 21:18.800
I want you to do that.

21:20.520 --> 21:21.480
You're welcome.

21:21.920 --> 21:22.880
Nice.

21:23.720 --> 21:25.320
If it's that important to
you, just give it to me.

21:29.920 --> 21:30.880
I'm waiting outside...

21:47.080 --> 21:49.320
I thought seeing him
would be good for me.

21:50.160 --> 21:51.560
I thought I could lock up then.

21:51.720 --> 21:53.600
But it just brings
back all the bad

21:53.720 --> 21:55.320
feelings I've had for
the past five years.

21:56.560 --> 21:57.840
He's dying, Ruth.

22:00.840 --> 22:02.000
That's what he got himself into.

22:03.160 --> 22:04.320
I don't think you feel that way.

22:04.440 --> 22:05.480
You don't know
me anymore, Rollie.

22:05.600 --> 22:06.760
I know who you used to be

22:07.480 --> 22:08.800
I know who you two were.

22:12.120 --> 22:13.160
Come on, Ruth.

22:13.640 --> 22:14.600
You are not like that.

22:18.840 --> 22:20.120
That's what he made of me.

22:26.640 --> 22:27.960
Can you say that again?

22:28.480 --> 22:30.520
Dilated cardiomyopathy.

22:31.760 --> 22:33.720
That's why your heart
was acting crazy earlier.

22:33.920 --> 22:35.240
That sounds serious.

22:35.360 --> 22:36.320
Now...

22:36.880 --> 22:39.360
It means that your heart
is extremely enlarged.

22:39.640 --> 22:41.000
I always said you
have a big heart.

22:41.120 --> 22:43.000
Let him finish if he
wants to tell me I'm dying.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.280
No, I don't do that at all.

22:48.440 --> 22:49.520
You need a new heart.

22:53.160 --> 22:54.120
Jackie is dead.

22:55.640 --> 22:56.920
She was one of the good guys.

22:58.320 --> 22:59.880
Well, I'm one of the bad guys.

23:02.120 --> 23:03.120
I am a murderer.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.080
I don't deserve to live

23:06.200 --> 23:08.080
That was 32 years ago, Sonny.

23:08.680 --> 23:10.480
You are not the same anymore.

23:10.840 --> 23:14.000
When I get a heart
that someone else

23:14.640 --> 23:15.720
a better person who could get

23:17.480 --> 23:19.000
I would take a second life

23:19.440 --> 23:20.880
I couldn't live with that.

23:26.920 --> 23:28.360
Good.  Time to move him.

23:32.960 --> 23:34.360
Breathe.  Go Go.

23:36.800 --> 23:40.280
The fragment was embedded
in the right inguinal artery.

23:40.400 --> 23:41.720
We have to get both of them out.

23:41.840 --> 23:42.840
Yes.

23:42.960 --> 23:43.920
I have it.

23:44.840 --> 23:45.960
It has to be vacuumed.

23:54.160 --> 23:55.760
Just a few milliliters of blood.

23:56.280 --> 23:58.120
Good.  No surprise
with this injury.

23:58.320 --> 24:00.480
His lungs may be
bruised, watch out for that.

24:00.600 --> 24:01.600
Look at the fragment.

24:05.240 --> 24:06.640
It ripped the renal artery.

24:07.680 --> 24:09.600
We have to remove the kidney
before he bleeds to death.

24:10.840 --> 24:11.800
Moment...

24:12.680 --> 24:14.240
What about an autotransplant?

24:14.360 --> 24:16.600
A viable source of blood
to support the kidney.

24:16.720 --> 24:17.680
Where should she go

24:17.800 --> 24:18.760
I don't know, but it takes as

24:18.880 --> 24:20.440
long as it takes to remove them.

24:20.560 --> 24:21.520
It saves him dialysis.

24:21.960 --> 24:23.080
From the external pool.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.160
The vessel is thick
enough and is the

24:25.280 --> 24:27.160
appropriate distance
from the bladder.

24:27.280 --> 24:29.240
You mobilize the kidney,
I prepare the iliac artery.

24:29.360 --> 24:31.840
Hey, that could work.

24:33.320 --> 24:34.360
Yes.

24:54.440 --> 24:55.560
Dont move.

24:56.200 --> 24:57.440
You can get me
out of this hospital

24:57.560 --> 24:59.720
or I'll cut you
open like Jackie.

25:10.560 --> 25:11.840
OK.

25:19.280 --> 25:20.560
How do you get me out of here?

25:21.000 --> 25:22.320
How do you get me out of here?

25:24.400 --> 25:26.520
Your internal bleeding
is getting worse, Damien.

25:26.680 --> 25:28.680
I can tell by the
paleness of her skin.

25:29.920 --> 25:30.880
Let me help...

25:31.280 --> 25:32.840
-I am fine.
-OK.

25:32.960 --> 25:34.160
Just get me out of here.

25:35.040 --> 25:36.160
You are not well.

25:37.200 --> 25:39.000
Your peripheral arteries are

25:39.120 --> 25:40.920
narrowed and prevent
proper blood flow.

25:41.880 --> 25:43.440
Because of this, your arm becomes weaker.

25:44.120 --> 25:45.080
Shut up!

25:45.920 --> 25:47.080
Your sweat means

25:47.320 --> 25:49.560
Your heart is racing to make
up for the loss of your blood.

25:49.680 --> 25:50.960
Your eyesight fades.

25:51.080 --> 25:52.560
You feel dizzy.

25:55.840 --> 25:58.280
You don't know
what you're saying...

26:03.640 --> 26:05.320
Get me a stretcher.

26:12.560 --> 26:13.720
Dr.  Pinkney.

26:13.840 --> 26:15.720
Dr.  Pinkney, I need
your help.  Now.

26:15.840 --> 26:17.520
Fine, bring him here.
His heart stands still.

26:17.640 --> 26:19.440
We need an emergency car, go.

26:19.720 --> 26:22.040
Command.  Clear alarm.
We have Damien.

26:22.560 --> 26:24.800
Here 306. We have
Damien in Center Stage.

26:24.920 --> 26:26.720
Pinkney, he's a patient.
Come here right now!

26:28.320 --> 26:29.280
Where did you find him?

26:29.560 --> 26:31.560
I found him in my office.

26:32.040 --> 26:33.320
He held a scalpel to my neck.

26:35.280 --> 26:36.480
My God!  Dr.  Rorish...

26:36.600 --> 26:37.560
No I'm fine.

26:37.680 --> 26:38.640
I want to see.

26:38.760 --> 26:40.200
All good.  Let's take
care of the patient.

26:40.320 --> 26:41.480
I'll do it...

26:42.360 --> 26:43.880
Well, I'll intubate,
you open it.

26:45.080 --> 26:46.280
Do you want to save this guy?

26:47.360 --> 26:49.120
I am neither a cop nor a judge.

26:49.240 --> 26:50.440
And neither do you.  Let's go.

26:52.040 --> 26:54.360
A laparotomy set.
Have someone call the blood bank.

26:54.800 --> 26:56.000
-Is it ready?
-Yes.

27:04.840 --> 27:08.000
The completed forms
for Sonny's transplant.

27:08.320 --> 27:09.280
How so?

27:09.680 --> 27:11.480
He's right, he doesn't
deserve a transplant.

27:11.640 --> 27:12.600
He's a murderer.

27:12.760 --> 27:14.520
I think people can change.

27:14.640 --> 27:15.680
Well, you're wrong.

27:18.840 --> 27:20.240
Who is this woman?
Do you know her

27:21.080 --> 27:22.040
No.

27:26.400 --> 27:29.680
I don't have a good
memory of my father.

27:34.000 --> 27:34.960
How do you feel?

27:35.280 --> 27:37.920
As good as a man with
a head full of blood feels.

27:38.440 --> 27:40.080
You took the papers and left?

27:40.600 --> 27:41.800
I have not seen her.

27:42.560 --> 27:44.200
-I'm getting more painkillers.
-No inconveniences.

27:47.160 --> 27:48.520
What's the matter with Guthrie?

27:49.080 --> 27:50.040
The tremor,

27:50.480 --> 27:52.560
Akinesia, postural instability.

27:52.680 --> 27:53.880
I can't talk to you about it.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.400
Do you think it's
Parkinson's here?

27:58.400 --> 27:59.400
Listen to me

28:00.440 --> 28:01.520
Ruth was right.

28:02.800 --> 28:03.880
We lost our friends

28:04.160 --> 28:05.320
our family.

28:05.840 --> 28:07.400
Everything that was important to us.

28:07.520 --> 28:10.080
I lost everything.

28:11.960 --> 28:12.920
And Rollie...

28:14.680 --> 28:16.800
He's your friend, right?

28:19.160 --> 28:20.280
Be his girlfriend.

28:21.600 --> 28:22.680
Even if it hurts.

28:24.360 --> 28:25.640
I'll get the morphine.

28:36.280 --> 28:37.480
The blood pressure is stable.

28:38.880 --> 28:39.920
Are we done here?

28:40.440 --> 28:41.400
Are you all right?

28:41.880 --> 28:42.840
No, actually not at all.

28:42.960 --> 28:44.560
Not even close!

28:44.680 --> 28:46.160
Why did you save this guy?

28:46.280 --> 28:47.240
Dr.  Pinkney...

28:47.800 --> 28:48.760
Go for a walk.

28:48.880 --> 28:50.280
-I don't have to.
-I guess so.

28:50.400 --> 28:51.440
I want an answer!  How so?

28:51.560 --> 28:53.120
Do you want to know why?
Do you want an answer?

28:53.680 --> 28:55.640
Because a patient had
an injured kidney artery.

28:55.760 --> 28:57.520
And a doctor was there.
There is nothing more to say.

28:57.640 --> 28:59.160
A patient... he's a killer!

28:59.280 --> 29:00.600
Does that make a
difference medically?

29:00.720 --> 29:02.920
Because if not, that is
completely irrelevant.

29:03.720 --> 29:04.880
Do you think that is irrelevant?

29:05.600 --> 29:08.840
This psychopath is getting
the best treatment in the world

29:09.120 --> 29:12.480
and keep eating tapioca
pudding and stabbing people.

29:12.600 --> 29:15.280
And Jackie, she's
going to the morgue!

29:15.400 --> 29:16.600
That's how it went this time.

29:17.320 --> 29:18.600
Is that okay with you?

29:19.120 --> 29:20.880
We do what we
can to save people.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.080
Without a court order.
Without prejudice.

29:23.280 --> 29:25.320
You can not change it.
That is what the job dictates.

29:25.880 --> 29:27.840
The only question for
you is: can you do it?

29:30.880 --> 29:31.840
No.

29:39.280 --> 29:40.440
The kidney takes on color.

29:40.560 --> 29:41.800
That's what happens
when it works.

29:42.080 --> 29:43.480
Continue.  We didn't
make it halfway.

29:44.120 --> 29:45.280
Here is the last fragment.

29:45.520 --> 29:48.920
I lift it up and you
tie the artery in place.

29:49.040 --> 29:50.960
You know i'm not
your first year doctor?

29:51.080 --> 29:52.560
Your haircut confused me.

29:56.440 --> 29:57.520
What's going on here?

29:57.640 --> 30:00.600
Who allowed you to
operate on this man?

30:01.000 --> 30:03.160
I don't remember
asking permission.

30:03.280 --> 30:04.240
Willis...

30:04.360 --> 30:05.480
Take it easy.  Keep working.

30:10.160 --> 30:11.480
And now?  Still relaxing?

30:11.600 --> 30:13.160
Go away!  Right away!

30:15.040 --> 30:16.560
- Do what I say!
-Willis.

30:16.680 --> 30:17.640
Do what i say

30:18.640 --> 30:20.040
Stop!  Shut up.

30:20.840 --> 30:22.440
Get out of there or I'll shoot you!

30:22.800 --> 30:25.040
We both know you're not
an American in US waters

30:25.160 --> 30:26.120
be shot.

30:32.320 --> 30:33.320
You're right.

30:34.440 --> 30:35.640
You bastard!

30:36.160 --> 30:37.120
Stop.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.080
That stops now.

30:45.720 --> 30:46.680
Arrest him.

30:46.800 --> 30:48.080
Me?

30:49.440 --> 30:50.960
Who do you think you are?

30:51.080 --> 30:57.240
Anatoly Sviataslov
Malinovsky Putin.

30:57.360 --> 30:59.960
And I'll take your
command away from you.

31:03.400 --> 31:04.360
Right away!

31:14.360 --> 31:15.760
The saturation drops.  Hurry up!

31:15.880 --> 31:17.760
If he dies we
lose our authority.

31:17.880 --> 31:19.720
You don't want to know
what will happen to us then.

31:27.080 --> 31:28.120
His pulse is weak.

31:28.240 --> 31:29.240
No breathing sounds left.

31:29.360 --> 31:30.720
Displaced trachea.
It's tension.

31:30.840 --> 31:32.200
Pulse is gone.
I start the resuscitation.

31:32.360 --> 31:33.320
I do the cut.

31:37.960 --> 31:40.320
Come come come.

31:40.480 --> 31:41.880
Come on, Ethan, in there.

31:52.800 --> 31:53.760
The pulse is back.

31:53.880 --> 31:55.040
The saturation gets better.

31:55.520 --> 31:58.160
Tell his uncle he will be back.

31:59.760 --> 32:01.280
And tell him not
to read our emails.

32:20.960 --> 32:22.520
Are these the forms
for the transplant?

32:24.720 --> 32:25.760
I said yes I don't do it.

32:25.880 --> 32:27.720
You will be released
soon, Sonny.

32:28.240 --> 32:29.720
This may be your last chance.

32:30.600 --> 32:32.840
Everyone deserves
to be forgiven.

32:35.080 --> 32:36.360
Tell them about the letter.

32:36.480 --> 32:39.080
No no.

32:39.680 --> 32:40.640
Then i will do it.

32:41.520 --> 32:43.280
They said they can't live
with the hatred anymore.

32:43.960 --> 32:44.920
Who?

32:45.920 --> 32:47.400
The dead man's parents.

32:49.600 --> 32:50.560
Yes.

32:52.160 --> 32:55.080
He read the letter to me so
often that we know it by heart.

32:57.160 --> 32:58.120
Come on.

32:58.320 --> 32:59.560
Tell them what the last line is.

33:06.040 --> 33:07.880
"We have to forgive you.

33:08.480 --> 33:12.360
We do that for us,
but also for you.

33:13.760 --> 33:15.200
We can't go any longer

33:16.000 --> 33:20.000
live with the
hatred in our heart. "

34:00.640 --> 34:01.600
Hank.

34:01.720 --> 34:02.680
See who is here.

34:08.960 --> 34:10.159
What are you doing here?

34:10.480 --> 34:11.840
It has long been bedtime.

34:20.239 --> 34:22.600
I also wanted the
elegant lifestyle.

34:25.040 --> 34:26.360
Maybe more than you.

34:26.480 --> 34:28.760
Ruth, you don't have to...

34:37.520 --> 34:39.199
Why don't we give
them some privacy?

34:48.639 --> 34:49.600
Did you keep that?

34:51.719 --> 34:52.920
We didn't have anything.

34:55.600 --> 34:56.679
We had it all.

35:01.640 --> 35:03.040
I introduced them to each other.

35:05.240 --> 35:07.280
Man, you were at the
beginning of your life back then.

35:10.120 --> 35:11.440
-Rollie?
-Yes.

35:12.360 --> 35:13.520
Time to talk

35:14.520 --> 35:15.480
About what?

35:16.280 --> 35:17.240
Malaya?

35:19.400 --> 35:20.880
Dr.  Guthrie, we know.

35:22.720 --> 35:23.680
So...

35:23.840 --> 35:25.360
I don't know what Hank said,

35:25.480 --> 35:27.040
but it's been a long
time since he...

35:27.160 --> 35:28.440
Hank didn't have to tell me.

35:29.280 --> 35:31.800
Young lady, you are a sophomore

35:31.920 --> 35:33.400
and I am the senior
physician in charge...

35:33.520 --> 35:34.840
... who has Parkinson's.

35:36.000 --> 35:36.960
Or something worse.

35:39.320 --> 35:41.960
And you came up with it
all by yourself, didn't you?

35:42.080 --> 35:43.840
No.  I.

35:43.960 --> 35:45.040
Oh, a nurse.

35:47.640 --> 35:49.080
I'm sorry Jesse.

35:49.360 --> 35:50.320
I did not want to...

35:50.440 --> 35:51.400
Yes, a nurse.

35:51.520 --> 35:53.440
The best you will meet.

35:53.560 --> 35:54.520
You are right.

35:54.640 --> 35:57.200
I just don't think
it's that bad.

35:59.200 --> 36:01.160
And I have a
right to my privacy.

36:04.600 --> 36:05.560
Rollie...

36:05.680 --> 36:06.760
Let us help you.

36:08.680 --> 36:09.640
Come on.

36:29.880 --> 36:32.440
With a little more
time I could wear mine

36:33.080 --> 36:35.560
instead of having to rummage
through the lost property office.

36:36.000 --> 36:36.960
How do I look?

36:38.040 --> 36:39.000
Like a homeless man.

36:41.680 --> 36:42.640
I want to help you.

36:44.640 --> 36:45.600
Yes.

36:47.600 --> 36:48.800
How tailor-made.

36:51.440 --> 36:52.400
How do I look?

36:53.480 --> 36:54.440
Perfect.

36:59.360 --> 37:00.520
Angus, Linda.

37:01.040 --> 37:02.480
Linda, Angus.

37:02.600 --> 37:03.920
Hi.  Nice to meet you.

37:04.320 --> 37:05.280
You are his...

37:05.520 --> 37:06.480
I am his stepmother.

37:06.600 --> 37:07.560
No she is not.

37:08.920 --> 37:12.440
She is... was my
father's girlfriend.

37:12.560 --> 37:13.520
Does not make a difference.

37:14.320 --> 37:16.200
Nice that you're
coming to the funeral.

37:16.320 --> 37:18.200
I finally want to see
what I'm paying for.

37:20.840 --> 37:22.680
-Do you want to take your car?
-That's in the workshop.

37:23.120 --> 37:24.080
Not the car.

37:25.200 --> 37:26.160
The impala.

37:27.800 --> 37:29.400
Your dad would
like you to have it.

37:34.960 --> 37:37.320
Does he still have the
waitress on the tap?

37:38.440 --> 37:40.520
Yeah, showing her
bum with every pothole?

37:41.840 --> 37:42.800
They still exist.

37:47.840 --> 37:49.280
I loved that thing.

37:50.600 --> 37:53.240
He purposely drove into
holes to make me laugh.

38:08.800 --> 38:09.760
There they are.

38:12.520 --> 38:13.880
We will make peace.

38:14.520 --> 38:15.680
You're kidding, aren't you?

38:31.880 --> 38:33.800
I was in extreme panic today.

38:36.400 --> 38:37.400
But that seemed different.

38:40.120 --> 38:41.080
We can be strong

38:41.400 --> 38:43.200
and be scared at
the same time, right?

38:49.320 --> 38:50.680
This is our job.

38:55.680 --> 38:56.760
Strong women.

39:01.280 --> 39:02.240
To Jackie.

39:03.840 --> 39:04.800
To Jackie.

39:10.840 --> 39:11.800
Oh my God.

39:25.880 --> 39:27.840
We are the reason
the boy was shot.

39:28.600 --> 39:30.600
We're the reason
he had a chance.

39:32.360 --> 39:33.320
Had we left him there, he would

39:33.440 --> 39:34.640
have been dead in 30 minutes.

39:34.800 --> 39:36.320
But... this is not going well.

39:38.800 --> 39:39.760
No.

39:40.800 --> 39:41.760
That’s not going well.

39:42.640 --> 39:44.400
That's why we're drinking this...

39:45.200 --> 39:46.920
...here and now.

39:47.640 --> 39:48.600
Did you steal that?

39:48.960 --> 39:50.160
It was a gift from Volkov.

39:52.200 --> 39:53.280
To the salvation of the world.

40:01.600 --> 40:04.040
You beat the captain of a
Russian submarine today.

40:05.240 --> 40:06.200
He deserves it.

40:07.680 --> 40:08.680
Yes that's true.

40:13.600 --> 40:15.520
Now you understand why I
stood before the court-martial.

40:18.120 --> 40:19.360
Sometimes they just deserve it.
