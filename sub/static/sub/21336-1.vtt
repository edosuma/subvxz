26:33.042 --> 26:35.042
Prime Minister Olof Palme...

26:45.584 --> 26:46.501
is...

26:50.167 --> 26:50.876
.â€œdead.

27:07.251 --> 27:11.334
The grief weighs heavily and
the feeling of unreality is numbing.

27:14.084 --> 27:18.792
What happens when a Prime Minister dies,
is exactly set out in the constitution.

27:27.501 --> 27:32.542
I saw her and it was terrible.

33:13.376 --> 33:15.834
You must have carried them.

33:17.209 --> 33:18.959
Gunnar.

33:29.001 --> 33:32.001
I can't stop thinking about you.

33:33.959 --> 33:36.084
Can I talk to you?

33:37.542 --> 33:41.626
Can we walk together like I do
with my dad sometimes?

33:50.876 --> 33:56.542
In all the shock and chaos, I saw
the oranges you were carrying.

33:58.959 --> 34:02.626
They were undamaged. Free.

34:35.626 --> 34:37.833
I didn't look at you first, sir.

34:38.708 --> 34:40.958
I have so much to admit to you.

34:44.126 --> 34:46.208
I felt the bang.

34:46.833 --> 34:50.417
My hard car hitting your soft body-

34:50.583 --> 34:53.667
-sounded like the crumple
of boots on snow.

35:00.667 --> 35:02.876
My radio had been playing.

35:03.834 --> 35:05.709
I got out of the car.

35:06.334 --> 35:07.917
I didn't...

35:08.084 --> 35:11.584
I wouldn't have turned the
radio off before I got out.

35:11.834 --> 35:13.334
Would I?

35:24.376 --> 35:26.251
There were people everywhere.

35:41.584 --> 35:45.167
Just then someone had called an ambulance.

35:46.459 --> 35:50.042
I should have called the ambulance.

35:51.209 --> 35:53.167
You were lying there.

35:55.084 --> 35:59.417
I am so sorry. I am so, so sorry.

36:20.209 --> 36:23.667
I wish I could turn the clock back.

36:23.834 --> 36:26.209
I swerved to miss the dog, sir.

36:26.917 --> 36:28.792
I did miss it.

36:28.959 --> 36:31.751
But didn't miss you.

36:31.959 --> 36:33.792
The unharmed dog-

36:34.376 --> 36:39.709
-was eating ham from a sandwich which
must have been in your bag, Gunnar.

37:14.334 --> 37:18.834
The ambulance came. The road was closed.

37:19.626 --> 37:23.292
They took you away, lights flashing,
siren ringing.

37:23.542 --> 37:28.751
I didn't turn the radio off, did I?

37:29.959 --> 37:32.834
<i>This is the local news.</i>

37:33.334 --> 37:37.501
<i>Russia is planning military activities
along the Crimean border...</i>

37:39.209 --> 37:42.959
Please tell me I didn't
turn the radio off!

37:44.834 --> 37:50.209
The police took a statement from me.

37:50.376 --> 37:53.209
And breathalysed me on site.

38:14.251 --> 38:18.209
Then, unbelievably,
I picked up the oranges.

38:18.917 --> 38:20.501
Why did I do that?

38:21.792 --> 38:26.209
To make the only improvement I could,
at a scene that was unimprovable?

38:27.834 --> 38:29.959
I don't know, Gunnar.

38:30.126 --> 38:33.501
I don't think I looked for your dog.
What happened to it?

38:33.667 --> 38:35.459
Who took it?

38:45.251 --> 38:50.042
I saw her and it was terrible.

38:50.209 --> 38:52.417
A car hit...

38:53.542 --> 38:55.959
...a man. He died.

38:56.334 --> 39:00.167
I won't be able to sleep tonight.
After this...

39:00.959 --> 39:03.001
It was so bad...

39:03.292 --> 39:05.959
...to see him fall down.

39:11.251 --> 39:16.334
My killing you has been killing me.

39:17.792 --> 39:20.084
I know it wasn't my fault, but-

39:20.292 --> 39:23.792
-the crunch, the oranges,
the radio, the dog...

39:24.667 --> 39:26.626
And you lying there...

39:26.917 --> 39:30.417
These things have clanged
like iron in my head.

39:32.292 --> 39:35.459
They've made me feel mad.

39:38.167 --> 39:41.542
I'm scared of my ability to hurt.

39:44.584 --> 39:45.959
How long did it take?

39:46.126 --> 39:49.959
You crossing the road, then
realising your dog wasn't there?

39:50.126 --> 39:52.042
Then me hitting you?

39:52.626 --> 39:54.126
10 seconds?

39:55.876 --> 39:57.626
Maybe 15?

40:14.792 --> 40:18.167
They aren't the only bad things
that happened in my life.

40:18.459 --> 40:22.626
But they are the 15 seconds
of the purest shock.

40:24.251 --> 40:27.251
They're uncategorisable. My nightmare.

40:27.584 --> 40:32.209
They won't bed down, they won't
become then. They're still now.

40:32.751 --> 40:37.376
They're more present than the present,
more here than here.

41:04.334 --> 41:06.334
St Mark's Church, Gunnar.

41:07.917 --> 41:09.876
Were you religious?

41:11.001 --> 41:16.042
If so, and you lived close by,
you were probably here.

41:22.876 --> 41:25.792
I don't know how to live, Gunnar.

41:26.209 --> 41:28.626
To walk towards you.

41:38.334 --> 41:41.792
Sigurd Lewerentz made this church
when he was 75.

41:48.501 --> 41:53.459
I'm an architect too, but I never thought
of making anything like this.

41:53.626 --> 41:57.292
The brickwork was influenced by Persia.

42:00.167 --> 42:05.376
Did the emotions blend into the walls,
like birch trees?

42:16.959 --> 42:20.084
St. Marks reminds me of a monastery.

42:20.417 --> 42:22.584
I could live here.

42:24.917 --> 42:27.334
If it wasn't a God house.

42:30.542 --> 42:34.584
Maybe monks' cells are good at
holding emotions in, Gunnar?

42:34.751 --> 42:36.376
Behind walls?

42:41.626 --> 42:44.501
Beneath here there was once a lake.

42:50.167 --> 42:52.709
Were you good at emotions, Gunnar?

42:53.251 --> 42:56.209
What things in life knocked you sideways?

43:02.626 --> 43:04.709
You didn't fight in a war, I guess..

43:04.876 --> 43:07.126
Sweden doesn't do wars.

43:09.292 --> 43:12.001
What were our country's big traumas?

43:25.751 --> 43:27.751
What were Stockholm's?

43:36.126 --> 43:38.459
The murder of Palme?

43:39.667 --> 43:41.501
Chernobyl?

43:42.917 --> 43:45.292
The sinking of the Estonia?

43:46.751 --> 43:49.876
But we've had no 9/11.

43:51.126 --> 43:55.876
So maybe we're worse at dealing
with bad stuff than other countries?

43:56.542 --> 43:59.126
Or am I worse?

44:00.792 --> 44:03.542
Did you talk to your kids, Gunnar?

44:03.834 --> 44:08.334
Did you cry when you watched old movies
or listened to old songs?

44:08.876 --> 44:11.584
Or the music of Berwald?

44:23.959 --> 44:26.334
Did you like this darkness?

44:26.542 --> 44:28.834
Can you answer me?

44:34.209 --> 44:36.626
Would you answer me?

44:37.376 --> 44:42.917
Maybe this kind of medieval building
is better at sadness, despair-

44:43.084 --> 44:46.667
-than all our clean lined,
democratic ones?

45:07.501 --> 45:09.792
There is another place, Gunnar.

45:09.959 --> 45:11.667
Can we go there?

45:15.542 --> 45:17.751
Engelbrekt church.

46:03.042 --> 46:08.584
Built in the 1910s, when your parents
would have been born, Gunnar.

46:08.834 --> 46:11.001
Maybe they came here.

46:12.959 --> 46:15.167
Were you ever inside here, Gunnar?

46:20.959 --> 46:23.292
Why am I today?

46:39.501 --> 46:41.376
Not for God.

46:46.001 --> 46:48.084
For a shareable story?

46:53.667 --> 46:57.626
To be with others, but alone?

47:04.251 --> 47:05.751
To soar?

47:15.459 --> 47:17.209
To hide I think.

47:17.542 --> 47:20.917
Its massive walls
make me feel safe.

47:24.501 --> 47:27.626
I'm here to feel like a foreigner.

47:28.876 --> 47:31.209
Who can forgive me?

47:31.751 --> 47:33.376
Can you?

47:33.959 --> 47:35.917
Do I need to be forgiven?

47:42.292 --> 47:44.834
I wasn't in the wrong.

47:48.459 --> 47:50.501
The police said so.

47:54.334 --> 47:58.292
Gunnar, there's somewhere
I've been meaning to go.

48:00.876 --> 48:04.084
A place of death and beauty.

48:07.042 --> 48:09.709
Maybe today I can.

48:53.417 --> 48:57.126
Asplund's and Lewerentz's
Woodland Cemetery.

49:16.209 --> 49:20.959
They wanted something new
for the oldest thing in the world.

49:41.542 --> 49:46.042
Lewerentz's St Mark's was so rough,
so grey.

49:46.334 --> 49:47.959
But here's his chapel.

49:48.334 --> 49:51.459
Tall portico between tall trees.

49:51.917 --> 49:56.376
He and Asplund had it laid out
to emphasise the tallness, Gunnar.

49:56.584 --> 49:58.917
I love this tallness.

50:00.709 --> 50:03.501
Did the day have an orange in its mouth?

50:03.834 --> 50:06.334
Did the birds fall from the trees?

50:06.709 --> 50:09.917
Were rooms still rooms this morning?

50:12.959 --> 50:16.084
Were things still three?

50:16.376 --> 50:19.084
Would I have noticed either way?

50:19.584 --> 50:23.667
In my days that were not days?

50:24.417 --> 50:27.042
When I'd come too old to play?

50:27.459 --> 50:30.334
When life was not a cabaret?

50:35.667 --> 50:39.209
The sun today makes me think of Italy.

50:50.001 --> 50:51.584
I walk, Gunnar.

50:56.667 --> 50:58.251
Towards you.

51:02.751 --> 51:04.709
I fall to my knees.

51:27.542 --> 51:29.417
I've wanted to go inside.

51:33.001 --> 51:35.001
Climb with me.

51:53.584 --> 51:55.126
It's locked.

51:55.292 --> 51:56.667
Maybe that's good.

52:00.084 --> 52:02.917
Is there light in my eyes, Gunnar?

52:03.334 --> 52:06.709
I've not lost my mask yet, have I?

52:17.042 --> 52:19.542
Maybe I can peep in.

52:32.459 --> 52:35.042
See what lies ahead.

52:49.501 --> 52:50.834
Wow.

52:52.542 --> 52:54.542
It gives me vertigo.

53:04.376 --> 53:06.792
Shame vertigo.

53:28.584 --> 53:32.042
I'm ashamed of those 15 seconds, Gunnar.

53:32.459 --> 53:35.251
I will be all my life.

53:38.459 --> 53:41.459
God, Gunnar.
This is reminding me of something.

53:41.667 --> 53:45.709
In the bible it says that there were
cities set up as refuge-

53:45.876 --> 53:48.501
-for accidental killers.

53:49.542 --> 53:51.292
People like me.

53:51.459 --> 53:54.501
People who're
afraid of being ostracised.

53:56.292 --> 53:59.376
Some were real cities in the real world.

53:59.709 --> 54:03.709
Hebron and Golan were
two of them, I think.

54:09.084 --> 54:11.626
The mother of the
high priest in the cities-

54:11.792 --> 54:14.834
-gave clothing and food
for the accidental killers.

54:15.001 --> 54:17.542
They lived there. Out of sight

54:18.959 --> 54:21.167
Like refugees.

54:23.167 --> 54:24.959
Atoning.

54:44.751 --> 54:46.209
I turn away.

54:54.792 --> 54:56.834
I focus.

54:57.251 --> 54:59.251
And what do I see, Gunnar?

55:00.167 --> 55:02.417
Maybe that's, me?

55:03.709 --> 55:05.834
The insect woman.

55:08.584 --> 55:10.751
Climbing over stuff.

55:13.251 --> 55:15.709
Renewing myself.

55:19.209 --> 55:22.792
Putting one foot in front of the other.

55:23.126 --> 55:25.209
Maybe that's me.

55:29.376 --> 55:31.709
All this walking.

55:41.917 --> 55:45.417
I should go home and face the music.

56:08.167 --> 56:11.167
I liked spending time with you, Gunnar.

56:13.667 --> 56:16.251
If only I could...

59:33.792 --> 59:36.834
Your light, Stockholm.

59:38.626 --> 59:40.834
It has come.

59:44.042 --> 59:47.959
It's the best thing about you,
the coming of the light.

01:00:11.584 --> 01:00:15.209
Can I talk to you in a different way?

01:00:22.209 --> 01:00:26.626
I thought too much yesterday.

01:00:31.126 --> 01:00:35.292
So I'll just look and listen today

01:01:13.251 --> 01:01:15.876
I don't mind where the day takes us

01:01:20.667 --> 01:01:23.334
And we can sing songs together

01:01:32.709 --> 01:01:35.376
A world shift

01:02:49.126 --> 01:02:52.876
Show me your face

01:03:06.501 --> 01:03:09.376
I was here yesterday.

01:03:11.917 --> 01:03:14.876
This swimming pool.

01:03:25.584 --> 01:03:29.167
Is this happiness?

01:03:33.667 --> 01:03:36.542
I'll give it a try

01:03:44.376 --> 01:03:47.334
Don't watch me

01:07:45.459 --> 01:07:48.167
Is this happiness?

01:07:50.084 --> 01:07:53.001
Naked swimming

01:08:09.001 --> 01:08:14.167
Freezing water

01:08:16.626 --> 01:08:21.251
To shock his body

01:08:23.001 --> 01:08:25.917
To get his blood pumping.

01:09:01.292 --> 01:09:03.917
Your lighthouse

01:09:07.376 --> 01:09:10.959
I love it

01:09:12.751 --> 01:09:16.876
50000 light bulbs were
made here each year.

01:09:18.417 --> 01:09:22.751
This glass box was lit up at night.

01:09:28.126 --> 01:09:32.709
This song's for you, my love

01:12:40.876 --> 01:12:42.917
Ok

01:12:45.834 --> 01:12:49.334
Let's go.

01:12:50.709 --> 01:12:52.542
You know where.

01:13:48.959 --> 01:13:52.751
I don't cry when things happen.

01:13:57.334 --> 01:14:01.167
Tears come later.

01:17:11.084 --> 01:17:14.876
That was my plunge in the sea.

01:17:16.709 --> 01:17:20.459
My skateboard.

01:17:27.709 --> 01:17:31.584
Thank you

01:17:39.251 --> 01:17:42.209
I've come here all my life

01:17:47.626 --> 01:17:50.709
Where has my happiness been?

01:18:02.626 --> 01:18:05.876
Your old people, Stockholm.

01:18:06.042 --> 01:18:08.834
They barged through the years.

01:18:23.542 --> 01:18:26.417
All the seeing I've done.

01:18:34.251 --> 01:18:39.209
So much of what I've seen is you.

01:18:45.959 --> 01:18:49.459
Your snow

01:18:57.917 --> 01:19:02.959
The dusk light it brings.

01:19:07.417 --> 01:19:11.876
No city's more silent when it snows.

01:19:27.501 --> 01:19:30.084
Your rain

01:19:32.709 --> 01:19:37.209
Remember that downpour two autumns ago?

01:19:38.917 --> 01:19:42.417
What was I looking at?

01:19:52.126 --> 01:19:55.917
It doesn't matter

01:19:56.084 --> 01:19:59.501
I was looking

01:20:08.834 --> 01:20:12.376
Looking at you

01:20:54.001 --> 01:20:57.459
Look at you now

01:20:57.626 --> 01:21:05.292
You just keep going

01:21:08.626 --> 01:21:11.792
Sanctuary

01:21:16.001 --> 01:21:19.542
Refuge

01:21:22.292 --> 01:21:25.876
Say something

01:21:32.626 --> 01:21:34.459
Say something.

01:21:47.542 --> 01:21:51.042
My happiness is coming back

01:21:56.209 --> 01:21:59.126
Something overtook me a year ago.

01:22:01.626 --> 01:22:04.542
Shame and fear

01:22:06.834 --> 01:22:09.751
I thought I was a modern person.

01:22:12.209 --> 01:22:16.709
But primitive feelings took over.

01:22:28.792 --> 01:22:31.584
I can look at them now, though.

01:22:38.959 --> 01:22:41.876
I have both in me.

01:22:49.792 --> 01:22:52.667
You have both in you.

01:22:55.334 --> 01:22:58.292
You're my lifeboat

01:22:59.334 --> 01:23:02.209
Thank you

01:23:26.667 --> 01:23:29.042
Shall I dive in?

01:23:30.917 --> 01:23:33.792
What do you look like
from under the water'?

01:23:34.305 --> 01:23:40.730
