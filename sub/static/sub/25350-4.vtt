00:11.177 --> 00:14.312
There's all of this chaos
and fighting going on.

00:16.950 --> 00:18.717
My daughter, she
would cry and stare

00:18.719 --> 00:20.952
out the window
and then laugh.

00:20.954 --> 00:23.455
I would always sleepwalk
and have night terrors.

00:23.457 --> 00:26.258
I thought something
was taking over her.

00:26.260 --> 00:27.992
Do you think
he's dangerous?

00:27.994 --> 00:32.464
Yes, he's enjoying
causing fear.

00:32.466 --> 00:34.933
A lot of dead
people in one spot.

00:34.935 --> 00:38.736
He could more than
likely kill you.

00:38.738 --> 00:41.406
I don't like this guy.

00:41.408 --> 00:44.675
And I just feel fear.

00:44.677 --> 00:46.478
My name is Amy Allan.

00:46.480 --> 00:49.481
This is like Grand Central
Station for the dead.

00:49.483 --> 00:50.682
I see dead people.

00:50.684 --> 00:52.951
They have pain
that they suffered.

00:52.953 --> 00:54.886
I speak to dead people.

00:54.888 --> 00:57.756
She hates them, hates them.

00:57.758 --> 01:00.224
And they speak to me.

01:00.226 --> 01:03.828
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

01:03.830 --> 01:07.165
It's a demon.
It's Satan.

01:07.167 --> 01:08.766
I rely on my partner.

01:08.768 --> 01:10.168
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:10.170 --> 01:12.237
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

01:12.239 --> 01:13.972
What was the body count,
what happened?

01:13.974 --> 01:17.642
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:17.644 --> 01:19.177
I don't know if
it's a demon or not,

01:19.179 --> 01:20.511
but it sure as hell
looks like one.

01:20.513 --> 01:22.047
It's my job to reveal them.

01:22.049 --> 01:24.649
I feel like I'm crazy.

01:24.651 --> 01:26.617
But Steve and I never speak...

01:26.619 --> 01:28.586
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:28.588 --> 01:29.788
...until the very end...

01:29.790 --> 01:31.990
I don't even want
to show you this.

01:31.992 --> 01:34.058
...when we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:34.060 --> 01:36.127
I just don't want anything
to happen to my mother.

01:36.129 --> 01:38.063
...or time to get out.

01:38.065 --> 01:39.597
You have to get out.

01:41.000 --> 01:47.074

01:51.811 --> 01:54.746
I'm out here in Jefferson City.
It's the capital of Missouri.

01:54.748 --> 01:56.614
I got a call from
a young couple.

01:56.616 --> 01:58.483
Activity got so bad for them,

01:58.485 --> 02:00.018
they had to pack up their bags,

02:00.020 --> 02:02.287
grab the kids, and
get the hell out.

02:02.289 --> 02:03.954
Now they got
a hell of a problem.

02:03.956 --> 02:05.623
They can't afford
to keep the house,

02:05.625 --> 02:07.024
but they know the house
is dangerous,

02:07.026 --> 02:08.425
so they refuse to sell it.

02:08.428 --> 02:10.360
These guys are
desperate and we hope

02:10.363 --> 02:12.363
we can help them find a way out.

02:15.235 --> 02:17.034
Before Amy arrives,

02:17.036 --> 02:21.239
I sweep the area looking
for any leading information.

02:21.241 --> 02:23.842
This house has a lot of
photos and religious symbols,

02:23.844 --> 02:26.978
so it's important that I
cover or remove them all.

02:26.980 --> 02:31.449
When I'm done, the location will
be ready for tonight's walk.

02:42.195 --> 02:45.864
There's all of this chaos
and fighting going on.

02:46.933 --> 02:48.199
****

02:48.201 --> 02:50.601
That was weird.

02:50.603 --> 02:55.340
Like I got a physical
push back on, like, my shoulder.

02:57.143 --> 03:00.678
There's so much energy,
it's insane.

03:00.680 --> 03:02.080
It's like this isn't even here,

03:02.082 --> 03:05.216
there's a **** whirlwind
of **** energy,

03:05.218 --> 03:07.152
like a vortex.

03:16.096 --> 03:17.896
So, Erin, when
we spoke on the phone,

03:17.898 --> 03:20.031
it sounded like things
were crazy here.

03:20.033 --> 03:23.168
Yeah, we bought
this house in 2017.

03:23.170 --> 03:25.169
The moment we walked in,
fell in love with it

03:25.171 --> 03:27.772
and six months after living
there, we had to move,

03:27.774 --> 03:29.641
we literally one
Monday morning said,

03:29.643 --> 03:32.444
"We're out," and put an offer
on a house two days later.

03:32.446 --> 03:34.645
Was there something that
happened that kind of,

03:34.647 --> 03:36.648
that was it,
you had to get out?

03:36.650 --> 03:38.916
Yeah, my daughter
had had night terrors

03:38.918 --> 03:41.519
and sleptwalked
every single night.

03:41.521 --> 03:44.856
She would cry and stare out
the window and then laugh.

03:44.858 --> 03:48.859
She was very weird,
she was very eerie.

03:48.861 --> 03:50.462
What was
the final straw?

03:50.464 --> 03:51.663
My daughter was
in the bathtub

03:51.665 --> 03:53.731
and she literally looked
over at me and said,

03:53.733 --> 03:54.799
"Mommy, what would
happen if I threw

03:54.801 --> 03:56.267
my baby brother
out the window?"

03:56.269 --> 03:57.468
What?

03:57.470 --> 03:59.270
Yep,
and I said, "Baby girl,

03:59.272 --> 04:01.739
we would never say that,
we don't joke about that."

04:01.741 --> 04:03.140
And a couple minutes later,
she started crying,

04:03.142 --> 04:04.408
and she said, "Mommy
I did not say that.

04:04.410 --> 04:05.810
My brain told me
to say that.

04:05.812 --> 04:08.279
I promise I did not say that,
I would never say that."

04:08.281 --> 04:09.547
Do you think she
was being possessed

04:09.549 --> 04:11.816
or do you think she
was being influenced?

04:11.818 --> 04:13.351
I mean, as a mother,
I don't even want to say

04:13.353 --> 04:15.620
that she was
being possessed,

04:15.622 --> 04:17.822
it makes me sick,
but, yeah.

04:17.824 --> 04:19.624
Okay, so now that your
daughter's in this other house,

04:19.625 --> 04:21.291
is she back to normal?

04:21.293 --> 04:24.429
She is, it's a night and day
different situation with her.

04:24.431 --> 04:27.265
When you were in the house,
who was living here?

04:27.267 --> 04:29.100
We're a family of four.

04:29.102 --> 04:32.103
It's me, and my husband's
name is Aaron also,

04:32.105 --> 04:35.640
and then Reina is 7
and Titus is now 2.

04:35.642 --> 04:37.375
This is a very
unusual case for us,

04:37.377 --> 04:39.310
you guys are already
out of the house.

04:39.312 --> 04:40.778
If we can fix what's
going on here,

04:40.780 --> 04:41.979
we'll give you
the tools for it,

04:41.981 --> 04:43.381
would you move back in?

04:43.383 --> 04:47.252
I don't know, even being
here gives me anxiety.

04:47.254 --> 04:49.854
Alright, so do me a favor
and give me a list

04:49.856 --> 04:51.256
of what the hell's
going on here.

04:51.258 --> 04:54.192
Footsteps, voices,

04:54.194 --> 04:57.128
electronics
turning on and off,

04:57.130 --> 05:00.064
apparitions,
my health declined.

05:00.066 --> 05:01.532
What's going on?

05:01.534 --> 05:03.868
I felt like I was getting
the life drained out of me.

05:03.870 --> 05:06.604
It was like it was
trying to make me weak,

05:06.606 --> 05:07.872
so that
I couldn't fight back

05:07.874 --> 05:09.340
and I couldn't
protect my daughter.

05:09.342 --> 05:11.342
Sometimes I thought
I was just crazy.

05:14.013 --> 05:18.883
It's a lot of residual
**** going on here.

05:18.885 --> 05:21.419
Would this residual
affect the living?

05:21.421 --> 05:25.890
Yeah, you're
feeling fear, panic,

05:25.892 --> 05:28.158
and kind of like disoriented.

05:31.498 --> 05:34.833
I think that could hit
you if you're depressed.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.835
It could make you lethargic.

05:36.837 --> 05:40.037
You might have dreams about it.

05:46.879 --> 05:48.279
I spent a lot
of time up here.

05:48.281 --> 05:49.680
This was my office.

05:49.682 --> 05:51.215
Every night
when we went to bed,

05:51.217 --> 05:53.551
basically we would hear
noises from up here.

05:53.553 --> 05:56.420
So, banging
or scratching.

05:56.422 --> 05:59.289
The house would
just start rumbling.

05:59.291 --> 06:00.491
Okay, I mean, things
have settled down

06:00.493 --> 06:02.093
at night and it's
quiet, but, you know,

06:02.095 --> 06:04.895
it's something Amy may be
able to help us out with.

06:04.897 --> 06:06.630
Now, is anything else
going on?

06:06.632 --> 06:08.299
Yeah, as I was cleaning
out my daughter's room,

06:08.301 --> 06:09.767
we were packing up
all of our stuff

06:09.769 --> 06:11.902
and I looked over
and there was a man

06:11.904 --> 06:14.038
standing in her doorway.

06:14.040 --> 06:16.240
He was tall and thin

06:16.242 --> 06:19.042
and he had an old-fashioned
suit and a top hat.

06:19.044 --> 06:20.111
Give me an age.

06:20.113 --> 06:21.712
40, 45.

06:21.714 --> 06:23.514
Alright, so with all
this activity going on,

06:23.516 --> 06:25.116
what the hell do
you think this house

06:25.118 --> 06:26.717
is asking of you
or wants from you?

06:26.719 --> 06:29.052
Sometimes I think it
wants to scare us,

06:29.054 --> 06:32.123
sometimes I think it
wants to control us

06:32.125 --> 06:33.658
and sometimes I think
it wants

06:33.660 --> 06:34.992
to suck the life
out of us.

06:38.131 --> 06:41.265
I keep seeing a doctor.

06:41.267 --> 06:44.801
This guy was just always,
like, super stressed.

06:47.540 --> 06:49.607
I feel like people
are seeing him.

06:52.812 --> 06:54.879
This seems pretty consistent,

06:54.881 --> 06:57.148
like it could be any
time of day or night

06:57.150 --> 07:00.885
and more when they're having,
like, taking a shower.

07:00.887 --> 07:02.620
I don't like him now.

07:07.293 --> 07:08.825
Do you think
he's dangerous?

07:08.827 --> 07:12.429
Yes, I do, because
of the knowledge

07:12.431 --> 07:16.300
he has about the body,
he's enjoying causing fear

07:16.302 --> 07:19.370
and he's enjoying
intimidating these people.

07:19.372 --> 07:22.573
His ultimate goal, really,
isn't to kill anybody,

07:22.575 --> 07:25.576
but he could if he wanted to.

07:32.919 --> 07:35.453
This is where most of
the things happened to me.

07:35.455 --> 07:36.586
Okay, like what?

07:36.588 --> 07:39.189
When I slept, I had
nightmares all the time.

07:39.191 --> 07:41.192
I remember one
very vividly,

07:41.194 --> 07:43.461
to the point where I
would recognize the people

07:43.463 --> 07:44.995
in it if I saw
them on the street.

07:44.997 --> 07:45.929
What happened
in that dream?

07:45.931 --> 07:47.598
I was walking
on a set of stairs

07:47.600 --> 07:49.132
and there was
an older woman

07:49.134 --> 07:50.801
and she was holding
a baby and that baby

07:50.803 --> 07:52.269
was frustrating her.

07:52.271 --> 07:55.472
And she beat the baby's head
against the stairs.

07:55.474 --> 07:56.607
So, was anybody else

07:56.609 --> 07:58.609
having these vivid nightmares
like you?

07:58.611 --> 08:01.679
Yeah, Reina definitely had
some terrible nightmares.

08:01.681 --> 08:03.013
Anything else?

08:03.015 --> 08:06.684
I had something lay on
top of me and trap me

08:06.686 --> 08:09.287
for about 10 minutes,
it smothered me.

08:09.289 --> 08:10.488
Alright,
so what happened?

08:10.490 --> 08:11.822
I was asleep
and I woke up

08:11.824 --> 08:13.824
and something was wrapping
its body on me.

08:13.826 --> 08:16.360
I couldn't move
and I couldn't scream

08:16.362 --> 08:17.761
and I couldn't ask
for help.

08:17.763 --> 08:19.363
Did it feel
like a person's body

08:19.365 --> 08:20.997
or just like
a mass on you?

08:20.999 --> 08:25.436
It was a big, dark mass
just smothering me.

08:25.438 --> 08:27.571
So while you were
getting pinned down,

08:27.573 --> 08:29.040
what sense did you get?

08:29.042 --> 08:31.642
It felt more like

08:31.644 --> 08:33.844
it liked taking
control of me.

08:36.649 --> 08:40.250
The doctor likes to
kind of torture people

08:40.251 --> 08:42.453
and he can get physical.

08:42.455 --> 08:44.654
Somebody's in here
trying to sleep

08:44.656 --> 08:47.992
and I saw him bolt
out of that bathroom

08:47.994 --> 08:52.662
and they're seeing this
thing coming at them.

08:52.664 --> 08:54.932
I'm being **** attacked.

08:54.934 --> 08:56.400
I'm being charged by this thing,

08:56.402 --> 08:57.868
I don't know what
the **** it is.

08:57.870 --> 08:59.469
What are they
seeing then?

08:59.471 --> 09:04.074
More of like a black ball thing,
but, like, fast.

09:04.076 --> 09:05.876
They're and
it's in their face,

09:05.878 --> 09:07.545
you know, like freaking 'em out.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.746
Definitely like,
"I'm gonna hurt you"

09:09.748 --> 09:11.682
is the feeling that
they're getting with it.

09:15.688 --> 09:17.421
They're waking up,
they look over,

09:17.423 --> 09:19.757
this thing charges them,
the next thing they know

09:19.759 --> 09:23.427
is that they're being
pushed on and touched.

09:23.429 --> 09:24.628
He's like doing weird ****,

09:24.630 --> 09:27.431
like giving them "examinations,"

09:27.433 --> 09:30.167
but it's like obviously
not appropriate,

09:30.169 --> 09:32.970
so they're feeling violated.

09:32.972 --> 09:34.505
It's **** weird!

10:01.067 --> 10:02.800
So Reina, I was
talking to Mommy today

10:02.802 --> 10:04.201
and she said
when you lived here,

10:04.203 --> 10:05.669
you were having
a tough time.

10:05.671 --> 10:07.604
Now, can you tell me
about some of the things

10:07.606 --> 10:08.806
that were going on?

10:08.808 --> 10:10.941
I would always sleepwalk
and have night terrors.

10:10.943 --> 10:12.476
Do you remember getting
up and sleepwalking

10:12.478 --> 10:14.011
or waking up from it?

10:14.013 --> 10:16.213
No?
No.

10:16.215 --> 10:17.881
Do you remember the
nightmares you were having?

10:17.883 --> 10:19.150
No.

10:19.452 --> 10:20.651
Okay.

10:20.653 --> 10:21.785
Anything else?

10:21.787 --> 10:23.720
Yes, I remember voices.

10:23.722 --> 10:25.321
Do you remember
what was said?

10:25.323 --> 10:28.992
When I was by the stairs,
I heard a girl say hi.

10:28.994 --> 10:30.527
And did you hear it
in your ear,

10:30.529 --> 10:33.663
or did you hear it
in your head?

10:33.665 --> 10:35.132
I heard it in my ear.

10:35.134 --> 10:36.733
In your ear, okay.

10:36.735 --> 10:38.535
Now, Reina, Mommy
told me about a time

10:38.537 --> 10:40.604
that a voice told
you to do something

10:40.606 --> 10:42.673
bad to your brother,
do you remember that?

10:42.675 --> 10:45.342
Yes, I think
it was a man.

10:45.344 --> 10:47.477
That told you to
hurt your brother?

10:48.747 --> 10:50.013
You didn't come up
with that yourself?

10:50.015 --> 10:51.347
No.

10:51.349 --> 10:53.216
But you don't hear those
voices anymore, do you?

10:53.218 --> 10:55.219
No.
That's good.

10:55.221 --> 10:57.421
So, Reina, this is
a real pretty room.

10:57.423 --> 10:59.756
If we can fix this,
the problem here,

10:59.758 --> 11:01.491
would you want to come
back and stay here?

11:01.493 --> 11:03.693
- No.
- No?

11:03.695 --> 11:04.828
Is it because you were
afraid when you were here?

11:04.830 --> 11:06.229
A little bit afraid.

11:06.231 --> 11:08.365
Yeah, okay, honey.

11:08.367 --> 11:11.435
And you don't want that
stuff to happen again?

11:11.437 --> 11:12.436
Okay.

11:15.240 --> 11:17.841
I'm seeing a teenage boy.

11:17.843 --> 11:20.977
He has brain damage.

11:20.979 --> 11:22.979
His energy is all weird.

11:22.981 --> 11:24.848
Okay, I'm seeing
somebody getting

11:24.850 --> 11:27.717
literally thrown
down the stairs.

11:27.719 --> 11:30.921
Physically picked up and thrown.

11:33.391 --> 11:36.126
Somebody choking, choking.

11:43.936 --> 11:47.737
The teenage boy is up
here with some man.

11:47.739 --> 11:50.073
What is
their relationship?

11:50.075 --> 11:53.944
I think
it's father and son.

11:53.946 --> 11:58.148
The thing about his
kid is this kid,

11:58.150 --> 12:03.153
who has brain damage, he
does cause a lot of problems.

12:03.155 --> 12:05.689
He doesn't know
how to communicate,

12:05.691 --> 12:08.224
so then he'll get really enraged

12:08.226 --> 12:11.628
when people aren't paying
attention or responding.

12:13.299 --> 12:16.499
And then he causes,
like, issues.

12:24.243 --> 12:26.443
So, Aaron, I was talking
to your wife

12:26.445 --> 12:28.511
and she was talking
to me about stuff

12:28.513 --> 12:29.846
going on with Reina.

12:29.848 --> 12:32.716
Might have been influenced
by something in the house.

12:32.718 --> 12:34.184
Do you agree with that?

12:34.186 --> 12:36.520
You know, the sleepwalking
was -- was creepy

12:36.522 --> 12:39.522
and I noticed that it was
happening every single night.

12:39.524 --> 12:41.124
I thought something was --

12:41.126 --> 12:43.059
something was
taking over her.

12:43.061 --> 12:45.395
And then in the morning, she
had no recollection of it.

12:45.397 --> 12:46.530
That must have
broke your heart.

12:46.532 --> 12:48.799
I was angry, just
angry at the situation,

12:48.801 --> 12:49.933
'cause I couldn't fix it.

12:49.935 --> 12:51.935
Do you believe
in this stuff?

12:51.937 --> 12:55.405
Before, not really, you know,
I'm a former police officer,

12:55.407 --> 12:57.474
former Marine, it was
hard for me to believe

12:57.476 --> 12:58.875
until I had
my own experiences.

12:58.877 --> 13:00.877
So you were
a Marine as well?

13:00.879 --> 13:01.945
Yes.

13:01.947 --> 13:03.346
Okay, Semper Fi, brother.

13:03.348 --> 13:04.948
Now, as far as experiences,

13:04.950 --> 13:07.417
what can you tell me
that you've had?

13:07.419 --> 13:09.486
In our bedroom,
above was the attic

13:09.488 --> 13:12.555
and I always heard
a loud banging noise,

13:12.557 --> 13:15.225
which I could describe
as someone dropping a box

13:15.227 --> 13:16.760
and then getting
upset and kicking it,

13:16.762 --> 13:18.428
'cause you would hear
a slide.

13:18.430 --> 13:19.429
Interesting.

13:19.431 --> 13:20.363
When I was talking
to your wife,

13:20.365 --> 13:22.499
she mentioned
the same noises.

13:22.501 --> 13:25.969
Is it possible it was
just an old-house noise?

13:25.971 --> 13:27.371
You know, at first
I thought it was,

13:27.373 --> 13:30.707
but that space above
the room, there's no floor.

13:30.709 --> 13:33.710
So, a loud noise like that
doesn't make any sense.

13:33.712 --> 13:35.178
Right, okay.

13:35.180 --> 13:36.379
Anything else?

13:36.381 --> 13:37.914
Every time I come
into the basement,

13:37.916 --> 13:39.383
I always feel
like someone --

13:39.385 --> 13:40.984
someone's jumping
on my back.

13:40.986 --> 13:43.453
Okay, so you're telling me
you're feeling that right now?

13:43.455 --> 13:45.588
Right now, yeah.

13:45.590 --> 13:49.525
It feels like,
just, almost like,

13:49.527 --> 13:51.662
like a lighter person,
like they have

13:51.664 --> 13:54.330
their legs wrapped around
my waist and on my --

13:54.332 --> 13:56.333
almost like a kid would
be holding onto me.

13:56.335 --> 13:58.068
It stays with me until
I leave this room.

13:58.070 --> 14:01.537
If we can fix it, would
you consider coming back?

14:01.539 --> 14:04.073
No, this house
terrifies me.

14:04.075 --> 14:05.542
Okay.

14:05.544 --> 14:06.810
As a former Marine,
a cop,

14:06.812 --> 14:08.278
if you sold
this house tomorrow,

14:08.280 --> 14:10.680
do you think you'd be putting
the other people in danger?

14:10.682 --> 14:12.348
Yes, 100%.

14:12.350 --> 14:13.417
Okay.

14:14.686 --> 14:19.289
The kid, the teenage boy, makes
me fearful for the living.

14:19.291 --> 14:22.692
When he freaks out,
he will lash out

14:22.694 --> 14:25.561
by punching people
or pushing people.

14:26.498 --> 14:28.932
And because there's
so many stairs here,

14:28.934 --> 14:32.101
if you're in the wrong
place and he freaks out,

14:32.103 --> 14:37.441
he could cause somebody
accidentally more harm.

14:37.443 --> 14:41.177
He's so uncontrollable
and unpredictable.

14:41.179 --> 14:44.047
He'll, like, throw a fit
and he'll, like, be stomping

14:44.049 --> 14:48.684
and screaming and yelling
and slamming things.

14:48.686 --> 14:52.055
He has PK, too.

14:52.057 --> 14:54.524
So, he's able to move
and affect things

14:54.526 --> 14:56.459
with his energy, so it's like,

14:56.461 --> 14:59.862
a double, you know,
kind of whammy there

14:59.864 --> 15:02.732
for living people who
are experiencing this.

15:02.734 --> 15:04.067
It's just like, "Look at me.
Look at me"

15:04.069 --> 15:06.069
or "Hear me, see me."

15:06.071 --> 15:07.137
He's bad.

15:27.825 --> 15:30.293
I would've had to been blind
to miss this first lead.

15:30.295 --> 15:32.829
There's this huge prison,
just down the street

15:32.831 --> 15:34.296
from the client's house.

15:34.298 --> 15:35.898
So, I made some calls
and tracked down

15:35.900 --> 15:37.466
the last deputy warden
of the place,

15:37.468 --> 15:39.034
who agreed to meet with me.

15:39.036 --> 15:41.237
He says the state pen
was known as

15:41.239 --> 15:43.973
the bloodiest 47 acres
in America.

15:50.915 --> 15:52.915
So, before we get
to all the bloodshed,

15:52.917 --> 15:55.050
curious when did
this place open?

15:55.052 --> 15:57.653
It opened in 1836,
the week that

15:57.655 --> 15:59.922
the Alamo battle was
going on in Texas.

15:59.924 --> 16:01.056
Okay.

16:01.058 --> 16:04.526
I've got a photo here
from about 1906.

16:04.528 --> 16:06.329
So, obviously
things got bad here,

16:06.331 --> 16:08.063
but when did that start?

16:08.065 --> 16:10.732
Well, Steve, it almost started
from the very beginning.

16:10.734 --> 16:13.269
The conditions were
absolutely horrific,

16:13.271 --> 16:15.537
where you had no heat
in these units,

16:15.539 --> 16:18.341
inmates that complained
about lice,

16:18.343 --> 16:19.809
about putrid food.

16:19.811 --> 16:21.410
I've actually got
a picture here, Steve,

16:21.412 --> 16:24.346
and you can see the
men in their stripes.

16:24.348 --> 16:26.015
Those men are from
punishment hall

16:26.017 --> 16:28.618
and they could be
whipped up to 150 lashes.

16:28.620 --> 16:31.087
It was a very
difficult institution.

16:31.089 --> 16:33.155
Okay,
this place is huge.

16:33.157 --> 16:35.358
I mean, how many prisoners
were here at one time?

16:35.360 --> 16:38.794
Up in the 1930's, there
was upwards of 5,000.

16:38.796 --> 16:42.164
So, this prison was one
of the largest prisons

16:42.166 --> 16:43.632
in the United States.

16:43.634 --> 16:45.300
So Mark, I gotta figure,
with all these prisoners,

16:45.302 --> 16:46.568
the conditions
and everything,

16:46.570 --> 16:47.903
there had to be
some riots, right?

16:47.905 --> 16:49.638
Yes, there were
a number of riots.

16:49.640 --> 16:51.907
The biggest one
was in 1954.

16:51.909 --> 16:55.110
Five offenders were
actually killed

16:55.112 --> 16:57.513
and about 80-some
were injured

16:57.515 --> 16:59.582
and here's all the
burned-out buildings,

16:59.584 --> 17:01.984
so it was really
quite horrific.

17:01.986 --> 17:03.919
How many people died
here over the years?

17:03.921 --> 17:07.056
I think upwards
of 2,000.

17:07.058 --> 17:07.990
2,000?

17:07.992 --> 17:10.459
Yes,
not all from violence.

17:10.461 --> 17:12.929
That's a lot of dead
people in one spot.

17:12.931 --> 17:15.664
So, you said there was
over 5,000 inmates here,

17:15.665 --> 17:17.398
anybody
I might have known of?

17:17.401 --> 17:19.001
Yes.

17:19.002 --> 17:21.404
Probably our most infamous
inmate was James Earl Ray

17:21.406 --> 17:24.339
and there's a photograph
of him.

17:24.342 --> 17:27.075
He escaped from here
in April of 1967,

17:27.077 --> 17:30.413
he killed Dr. King
in April of '68.

17:30.415 --> 17:32.882
Alright, so I know Missouri
has the death penalty.

17:32.884 --> 17:35.083
Was there any executions
right here in this prison?

17:35.085 --> 17:40.822
Yes, there were a total
of 39 by lethal gas

17:40.824 --> 17:44.026
and the very first one
by lethal injection

17:44.028 --> 17:45.961
occurred here in 1989.

17:45.963 --> 17:47.563
Suffice it to say,

17:47.565 --> 17:50.832
47 bloodiest acres
is pretty accurate.

17:50.834 --> 17:52.501
Pretty accurate,
yes, sir.

17:58.509 --> 18:00.242
I am getting like
a lot of screaming

18:00.244 --> 18:04.113
and yelling around here and
it's all of these people.

18:04.115 --> 18:06.782
They seem really
close and it doesn't

18:06.784 --> 18:08.451
feel like that long ago.

18:08.453 --> 18:10.786
There's a great deal of time

18:10.788 --> 18:15.057
where there's all of this chaos
and fighting going on.

18:17.728 --> 18:23.265
But, you know, this is
quite a few years of this

18:23.267 --> 18:26.535
and it seems like
more men than women.

18:26.537 --> 18:28.003
They're bad, bad people.

18:32.276 --> 18:34.609
So far, I've got
a family too freaked out

18:34.611 --> 18:36.479
to live in their own
home on a property

18:36.481 --> 18:40.616
near an abandoned prison
where about 2,000 people died.

18:40.618 --> 18:44.019
But I want to see if
there's anything else.

18:44.021 --> 18:45.287
Searching through old records,

18:45.289 --> 18:47.356
I find a woman
named Violet Ramsey,

18:47.358 --> 18:49.358
who owned property
next to my clients

18:49.360 --> 18:51.159
in the mid-1800's.

18:51.161 --> 18:55.364
Turns out,
she was a freed slave.

18:55.366 --> 18:57.566
You know, it's pretty
unusual for a freed slave

18:57.568 --> 18:59.502
to end up owning
a bunch of land.

18:59.504 --> 19:01.103
So, I called a local historian

19:01.105 --> 19:02.704
and she looked into it for me.

19:02.706 --> 19:05.774
She says Violet Ramsey's
story is amazing

19:05.776 --> 19:07.910
and definitely something
I'm gonna want to know about.

19:15.453 --> 19:17.853
So Dr. Greene, I appreciate
you meeting with me.

19:17.855 --> 19:19.454
This woman I came
across in my research

19:19.456 --> 19:20.456
sounds pretty incredible.

19:20.458 --> 19:22.124
I mean, what can you
tell me about her?

19:22.126 --> 19:25.794
Violet Ramsey was born
in 1796 in Kentucky.

19:25.796 --> 19:28.397
She was brought to Missouri
by her slave holder.

19:28.399 --> 19:31.667
By 1838, she's able to
purchase her freedom.

19:31.669 --> 19:34.003
Six months later, she
buys a house next

19:34.005 --> 19:36.539
to the property that
you're investigating.

19:36.541 --> 19:37.806
Okay.

19:37.808 --> 19:40.342
To be able to do
that was unusual.

19:40.344 --> 19:41.610
What happens next
with her?

19:41.612 --> 19:45.014
For seven years, Violet
works as a laundress

19:45.016 --> 19:48.150
and she is able to,
in 1845,

19:48.152 --> 19:50.886
purchase the freedom
of her husband, Elijah,

19:50.888 --> 19:53.622
and her youngest son,
Josiah.

19:53.624 --> 19:55.891
10 years later, the
three of them are able

19:55.893 --> 19:59.695
to purchase the freedom
of her older son, Harrison.

19:59.697 --> 20:01.163
So now,
they're all together.

20:01.165 --> 20:03.065
Do we know anything
about the husband, Elijah?

20:03.067 --> 20:06.902
Yes, in the 1860 census,
we know that Elijah

20:06.904 --> 20:09.905
was a teamster
and a farmer

20:09.907 --> 20:14.109
and Violet is still listed
as a laundress.

20:14.111 --> 20:15.377
Looking at this, though,

20:15.379 --> 20:18.380
it looks like they had
quite a bit of assets.

20:18.382 --> 20:20.382
Yes, they never
stopped working.

20:20.384 --> 20:23.252
They bought six
additional plots of land

20:23.254 --> 20:25.321
in the neighborhood,
so much so,

20:25.323 --> 20:28.323
that their children were
able to donate 40 acres

20:28.325 --> 20:30.125
of land
to Lincoln University,

20:30.127 --> 20:32.394
where I've taught
for 22 years.

20:32.396 --> 20:34.663
So for a woman
all on her own,

20:34.665 --> 20:36.065
she achieved quite a bit.

20:36.067 --> 20:37.600
Exactly.

20:37.602 --> 20:41.537
To amass the amount of land
and personal property

20:41.539 --> 20:43.606
that she
and her family amassed,

20:43.608 --> 20:46.208
that was, that was
really phenomenal.

20:53.351 --> 20:57.486
So, it feels like
this is where that man

20:57.488 --> 21:01.390
and his son who has
brain damage stay.

21:03.627 --> 21:05.894
Any idea
who the man was?

21:05.896 --> 21:10.633
I think he worked
here at some point.

21:10.635 --> 21:12.901
A caretaker or some ****

21:12.903 --> 21:13.769
Did he live here?

21:13.771 --> 21:15.771
I think he did, yeah.

21:15.773 --> 21:17.906
I think he, like, just took
care of everything,

21:17.908 --> 21:20.709
like the yard, the house.

21:20.711 --> 21:22.378
I think that you would feel sick

21:22.380 --> 21:24.713
in this room if you stayed
in here for a while.

21:28.119 --> 21:29.184
Weird.

21:34.659 --> 21:36.725

21:36.727 --> 21:38.260
and if you need us

21:38.262 --> 21:40.128
unexplained activity
in your home...

if we can.

22:00.317 --> 22:02.384
Another thing caught
my attention in research.

22:02.386 --> 22:04.452
A former owner of the property
had to go

22:04.454 --> 22:07.255
to the funerals of four
of his own children.

22:07.257 --> 22:09.257
So, I called up
a local genealogist,

22:09.259 --> 22:11.259
who's helped me on another case

22:11.261 --> 22:13.395
and she says losing
the kids was just

22:13.397 --> 22:14.930
the start of this
guy's troubles.

22:21.205 --> 22:22.470
Well, Mary,
it's good to see you again.

22:22.472 --> 22:23.939
I appreciate you helping
me out with this.

22:23.941 --> 22:25.339
So you mentioned
on the phone,

22:25.341 --> 22:27.209
this guy had
a pretty tragic life

22:27.211 --> 22:29.076
with losing four kids.

22:29.078 --> 22:30.211
Before we even get
to that,

22:30.213 --> 22:31.480
do you know anything
about him?

22:31.482 --> 22:32.814
Yes, I have
a picture of him.

22:32.816 --> 22:35.050
His name was
Phillip Thomas Miller.

22:36.686 --> 22:38.954
He was
a store owner originally,

22:38.956 --> 22:43.024
but then he became warden
of the state penitentiary.

22:43.026 --> 22:44.626
You know, Mary, I'm not sure
if you're aware or not,

22:44.628 --> 22:46.427
but my client's
house is right there.

22:46.429 --> 22:48.496
That red-brick
building on the right.

22:48.498 --> 22:50.431
Do we know when he
acquired the property here?

22:50.433 --> 22:54.102
He acquired
the property about 1859

22:54.104 --> 22:57.372
and then he moved his wife
and young family there.

22:57.374 --> 22:59.507
I do have this picture
of her.

23:03.246 --> 23:04.246
You told me on the phone,

23:04.248 --> 23:05.647
he buried four
of his children.

23:05.649 --> 23:06.714
Yes.

23:06.716 --> 23:07.716
Okay, what's the story
with that?

23:07.718 --> 23:09.518
Two of them died
as infants,

23:09.520 --> 23:12.053
then he lost his daughter
Mattie

23:12.055 --> 23:13.855
at age 23 of meningitis.

23:13.857 --> 23:16.158
I have an article
here about that.

23:18.328 --> 23:20.395
So that's three,
what's the four?

23:20.397 --> 23:22.797
His son died
at the age of 41.

23:22.799 --> 23:24.866
Okay,
do we know from what?

23:24.868 --> 23:26.468
We're not exactly sure.

23:26.470 --> 23:27.669
Right, now, you
mentioned on the phone

23:27.671 --> 23:29.403
that after
the kids all died,

23:29.405 --> 23:31.339
that he still had more
troubles, what happened?

23:31.341 --> 23:37.678
Phillip was in debt
to the tune of $644 in 1878.

23:37.680 --> 23:39.681
That's about $16,000
in today's money.

23:39.683 --> 23:40.949
What does he do?

23:40.951 --> 23:44.152
He was forced to sell
his property at a loss.

23:44.154 --> 23:46.221
Does he stay
in the area?

23:46.223 --> 23:49.558
He does, he moves
about 1,000 feet away

23:49.560 --> 23:51.626
into a much smaller place.

23:51.628 --> 23:53.561
Okay, so things went
downhill for this guy.

23:53.563 --> 23:54.495
Yes.

23:57.568 --> 24:01.903
I'm seeing this doctor,
doctor, doctor guy.

24:01.905 --> 24:03.771
Was this guy
actually a doctor?

24:03.773 --> 24:07.909
I was seeing some odd visuals.

24:07.911 --> 24:11.913
Bodies and him being, like,
around these bodies.

24:14.651 --> 24:17.184
So, I was kind of thinking
there's something

24:17.186 --> 24:19.387
with that maybe going on here.

24:19.389 --> 24:21.656
Do you have any idea what
he wants with the living?

24:21.658 --> 24:24.859
When he was alive,
he had a lot of things

24:24.861 --> 24:26.594
that he had to hide.

24:26.596 --> 24:32.200
He wasn't in a particularly
powerful position.

24:32.202 --> 24:37.338
He was always in a very
submissive kind of way

24:37.340 --> 24:40.642
and I think now he feels
like he has a lot of power.

24:42.746 --> 24:45.447
And he can get away with
doing what he wants to do.

24:46.950 --> 24:49.417
So, I think he's enjoying this.

24:50.887 --> 24:53.754
Okay, so now, Miller loses
my client's property.

24:53.756 --> 24:55.290
What happens next?

24:55.292 --> 24:58.727
His daughter Louisa was very
attached to the property.

25:00.897 --> 25:03.899
She spent about six
years scraping together

25:03.901 --> 25:06.501
enough money to buy
the property back.

25:06.503 --> 25:09.304
So in 1884, she did so.

25:09.306 --> 25:11.105
Does she move the old man
back on the property?

25:11.107 --> 25:12.373
Yes, she does.

25:12.375 --> 25:14.642
Okay, so did things get
better for them then?

25:14.644 --> 25:16.444
Not particularly.

25:16.446 --> 25:18.579
The same year she moved
back to the property,

25:18.581 --> 25:20.782
she lost her 12-year-old
daughter, Kelly,

25:20.784 --> 25:23.652
to mysterious
circumstances.

25:23.654 --> 25:25.120
Now what?

25:25.122 --> 25:30.191
In 1894, she lost her
father as well at age 75.

25:30.193 --> 25:31.292
Okay, so then he dies.

25:31.294 --> 25:32.193
Now, does he die
on the property?

25:32.195 --> 25:33.461
Yes.

25:33.463 --> 25:34.729
I mean, this family's
been through a lot.

25:34.731 --> 25:36.464
Does it ever get
better for them?

25:36.466 --> 25:37.598
Not really.

25:37.600 --> 25:40.868
In 1906, Louisa loses
the property again

25:40.870 --> 25:43.071
and has
to move next door.

25:43.073 --> 25:44.539
Whatever happened to her?

25:44.541 --> 25:47.075
Louisa actually lived
to be 80 years old

25:47.077 --> 25:50.278
and she died on the property
next to your clients

25:50.280 --> 25:54.482
in 1926
of cerebral hemorrhage.

25:54.484 --> 25:56.684
You know, Mary, it says
here she's a widow.

25:56.686 --> 25:58.019
Do we know anything
about the husband?

25:58.021 --> 26:00.088
All we really know about
him is that he died

26:00.090 --> 26:03.291
a couple years before her
father lost the property.

26:03.293 --> 26:04.759
Well, it's a sad story
to say the least.

26:04.761 --> 26:06.828
I mean, this family
couldn't catch a break.

26:09.700 --> 26:11.966
I'm seeing an old lady,
she's about 80.

26:14.971 --> 26:18.840
She's upset because
her land is gone,

26:18.842 --> 26:20.975
she wants her land back.

26:25.115 --> 26:27.649
And she's just mad at me.

26:27.651 --> 26:29.250
I'm getting that she's a widow

26:29.252 --> 26:32.253
and her husband died
when she was young.

26:32.255 --> 26:34.589
Do you have any
idea when this was?

26:34.591 --> 26:37.993
She would have been born

26:37.995 --> 26:43.531
probably like, in the 18...50's.

26:43.533 --> 26:46.368
She's tough, she went
through a lot of **** man.

26:48.071 --> 26:50.405
So, she thinks like,
that she's cursed

26:50.407 --> 26:52.740
or this place is cursed.

27:01.684 --> 27:04.018
I saw several disturbing
things on my walk,

27:04.020 --> 27:06.020
but one thing stood out.

27:06.022 --> 27:07.622
The guy who seemed
like a doctor,

27:07.624 --> 27:10.758
attacking a living woman,
has me really worried.

27:10.760 --> 27:15.196
He had on, like, round glasses.

27:16.366 --> 27:18.165
Deep-set eyes.

27:18.167 --> 27:21.503
He had a long, thin nose.

27:21.505 --> 27:23.972
Maybe it's a little bit shorter.

27:29.980 --> 27:32.246
Amy, is this
who you saw?

27:32.248 --> 27:33.214
Yes.

27:59.141 --> 28:00.607
Now that Amy and I

28:00.609 --> 28:02.743
have completed our
investigations,

28:02.745 --> 28:04.745
we're ready to reveal our
findings to each other

28:04.747 --> 28:07.948
and our clients
for the first time.

28:07.950 --> 28:11.418
So, Amy, this is
a pretty unusual case

28:11.420 --> 28:13.754
because no one lives in this
beautiful house right now.

28:13.756 --> 28:15.822
Things got so bad here

28:15.824 --> 28:18.892
that these guys grabbed
their two kids and left.

28:18.894 --> 28:20.827
Now, this is Erin
and her husband,

28:20.829 --> 28:22.629
who's also named Aaron.

28:22.631 --> 28:26.166
I have a photo of their
two beautiful kids --

28:26.168 --> 28:28.502
their 7-year-old daughter,
Reina,

28:28.504 --> 28:31.105
and this is their
3- year-old, Titus.

28:31.107 --> 28:33.107
Now, these guys are stuck.

28:33.109 --> 28:35.375
Can't afford to let
this place sit empty,

28:35.377 --> 28:39.245
but they don't think it's safe
for anybody else to live here.

28:39.247 --> 28:40.647
So now that Amy knows
a little bit about you guys,

28:40.649 --> 28:42.382
she'll describe her walk for us.

28:45.588 --> 28:48.721
When I got here, it was
just layers and layers

28:48.723 --> 28:51.325
and layers of
residual information.

28:51.327 --> 28:54.261
I saw a lot of
different time periods.

28:54.263 --> 28:56.597
I was hearing a lot of
screaming and yelling.

28:56.599 --> 29:00.267
Seemed like a lot
of these people

29:00.269 --> 29:02.269
didn't really belong here.

29:02.271 --> 29:03.470
I saw fighting.

29:03.472 --> 29:06.940
I just felt an extreme
amount of hate.

29:06.942 --> 29:10.944
I felt like this type
of residual energy

29:10.946 --> 29:16.416
would create feelings of
despair or depression.

29:16.418 --> 29:18.218
Either one of you guys
ever feel that way

29:18.220 --> 29:19.285
while you were living here?

29:19.287 --> 29:22.622
I did.
I would stay in bed for days.

29:22.624 --> 29:25.092
She was going to bed 4:30,
5:00 in the afternoon.

29:25.094 --> 29:26.359
It was crazy, I had
never seen anything

29:26.361 --> 29:28.362
with her
especially like it.

29:28.364 --> 29:30.697
Now, she mentioned violence

29:30.699 --> 29:33.633
and people who didn't seem
like they belonged here.

29:33.635 --> 29:36.169
I thought of the jail
right away, the prison.

29:36.171 --> 29:37.638
Matter of fact, when
you stand in front

29:37.640 --> 29:40.173
of one of your porches, you
could actually see it from here.

29:40.175 --> 29:41.441
So the Missouri
State Penitentiary,

29:41.443 --> 29:42.709
I'm sure you guys
are aware of it,

29:42.711 --> 29:46.647
opened up in 1836,
closed in 2004.

29:46.649 --> 29:48.448
So I actually have
a picture of the prison

29:48.450 --> 29:51.518
at the turn of the century.

29:51.520 --> 29:54.520
I spoke to the prison's
last deputy warden

29:54.522 --> 29:56.856
and he says the place
was trouble from day one.

29:58.393 --> 30:00.394
There were four major riots
that happened at this prison.

30:00.396 --> 30:02.262
The worst one was in 1954.

30:02.264 --> 30:05.265
Left four inmates dead and
millions of dollars worth

30:05.267 --> 30:08.201
of damage to the prison itself.

30:08.203 --> 30:09.403
They burned it.
Yeah.

30:09.405 --> 30:10.803
That's -- Okay, got it.

30:10.805 --> 30:13.874
Now, in the time that
the prison was operating,

30:13.876 --> 30:17.010
over 2,000 prisoners
passed away there.

30:17.012 --> 30:18.946
Wow.

30:23.485 --> 30:26.219
So the first individual
that I came across

30:26.221 --> 30:30.490
is a deceased teenager
about 14 years of age

30:30.492 --> 30:34.962
and I am concerned about him
for many different reasons,

30:34.964 --> 30:38.899
but one is that he
is brain damaged.

30:38.901 --> 30:42.302
He is here with his
father, who I believe

30:42.304 --> 30:46.173
was some kind of caretaker
for the house, the property.

30:46.175 --> 30:49.642
Looking at them, I'm thinking
maybe back to the 1930s.

30:49.644 --> 30:52.112
The man and his son
currently spend

30:52.114 --> 30:55.182
most of their time in the attic.

30:55.184 --> 30:59.519
When he feels like he's
not being paid attention to

30:59.521 --> 31:04.524
or recognized,
he tends to slip out.

31:04.526 --> 31:10.130
Like he'll stomp around,
yelling, throwing things.

31:10.132 --> 31:11.698
Well, I didn't come across
any brain-damaged kids

31:11.700 --> 31:14.734
in research, but you said
he has fits up in the attic,

31:14.736 --> 31:17.403
throwing things.

31:17.405 --> 31:20.540
Every night, I'd hear
what I would describe,

31:20.542 --> 31:22.609
somebody dropping a box

31:22.611 --> 31:24.944
and then getting angry and
kicking it across the room.

31:24.946 --> 31:27.748
It would be over my bed
where the attic is.

31:27.750 --> 31:29.750
Interesting, interesting.

31:29.752 --> 31:34.755
He can become physical
with living people.

31:34.757 --> 31:39.559
I saw him punching a living
person in the stomach

31:39.561 --> 31:41.228
to get their attention.

31:41.230 --> 31:44.698
Now, Aaron, I want you
to talk to Amy about

31:44.700 --> 31:46.166
the kid jumping on your --

31:46.168 --> 31:47.500
what you described as
a kid jumping on your back.

31:47.502 --> 31:49.970
In the basement,
I'd feel heavy

31:49.972 --> 31:53.439
almost as though someone's
jumping on my back.

31:53.441 --> 31:54.640
Once I leave that room,

31:54.642 --> 31:57.644
it was like a weight
lifted off my shoulders.

32:00.449 --> 32:02.516
The next deceased
person I encountered

32:02.518 --> 32:06.720
was an older lady,
who was probably in her 80s.

32:06.722 --> 32:09.389
I think she lived and died here.

32:09.391 --> 32:11.858
I think she died
around the '30s, 1930s.

32:11.860 --> 32:19.333
She experienced and went through
a lot of **** in her life.

32:19.335 --> 32:22.536
Kept referring to her as
the widow, so I'm like, "Okay,

32:22.538 --> 32:25.605
so she probably lost a loved
one, probably her husband."

32:25.607 --> 32:27.807
The thing she was
really worked up about

32:27.809 --> 32:30.410
was the property, the land.

32:30.412 --> 32:34.814
She told me she lost it and
she wants it back really bad.

32:34.816 --> 32:38.618
There was also an indication
of nightmare activity

32:38.620 --> 32:40.620
with her specifically.

32:40.622 --> 32:42.222
Yeah, I had nightmares
all the time.

32:42.224 --> 32:45.358
I had a nightmare
about an old woman

32:45.360 --> 32:49.295
who, on a set of stairs
that were curved,

32:49.297 --> 32:50.897
she was in a nightgown

32:50.899 --> 32:53.566
and she killed a baby
on the stairs.

32:53.568 --> 32:56.770
Now, you told me your daughter
has nightmares, right?

32:56.772 --> 32:58.104
Yes.

32:58.106 --> 32:59.306
Can you tell Amy?

32:59.308 --> 33:01.041
My daughter was
sleepwalking a lot.

33:01.043 --> 33:03.843
I guess I would call
like a possession.

33:03.845 --> 33:05.178
Head tilted,
wide-eyed,

33:05.180 --> 33:07.047
and she would walk
and she would talk

33:07.049 --> 33:10.850
and do creepy smiles
and creepy laughs.

33:10.852 --> 33:11.918
This is what kind
of brought them

33:11.920 --> 33:13.120
to moving the hell out of here.

33:13.122 --> 33:15.788
Erin, tell Amy what
the final straw was.

33:15.790 --> 33:16.989
Reina was sitting
in the bathtub

33:16.991 --> 33:18.991
and she literally looked
over at me and said,

33:18.993 --> 33:20.126
"Mommy,
what would happen

33:20.128 --> 33:22.595
if I threw my baby
brother out the window?"

33:22.597 --> 33:23.796
And I said, "We don't
joke about that

33:23.798 --> 33:25.132
and we don't talk
about that,"

33:25.134 --> 33:26.466
and then she started crying
a couple minutes later

33:26.468 --> 33:27.868
and she said, "Mommy,
I did not say that.

33:27.870 --> 33:30.270
I would never say that.
My brain told me to say that."

33:30.272 --> 33:32.539
Wow.

33:32.541 --> 33:35.208
I got a pretty good idea
of who you might've seen.

33:35.210 --> 33:38.211
Now, there was a woman
named Louisa Miller.

33:38.213 --> 33:41.815
She was born on the property
next door to here in 1845

33:41.817 --> 33:44.684
and moved on to this
property in 1859.

33:44.686 --> 33:49.088
Now, in 1876, her husband died
suddenly of unknown causes.

33:49.090 --> 33:52.425
So when you mentioned the
widow thing, it made sense.

33:52.427 --> 33:55.362
Two years later, her father
got himself buried in debt

33:55.364 --> 33:58.031
and the family had to sell the
property to cover the bills.

33:58.033 --> 33:59.966
So the genealogist I spoke to

33:59.968 --> 34:01.968
said that Louisa
was really broken up

34:01.970 --> 34:05.037
about losing this property and
she spent the next six years

34:05.039 --> 34:07.507
scraping together
money and in 1884,

34:07.509 --> 34:08.842
she managed to buy it back.

34:08.844 --> 34:10.710
But the good times didn't last.

34:10.712 --> 34:13.045
She got back into debt
and lost the property

34:13.047 --> 34:14.915
a second time in 1906.

34:14.917 --> 34:16.649
She ended up having
to buy a cabin

34:16.650 --> 34:18.451
on the property next door.

34:18.453 --> 34:23.389
She wound up dying of a
cerebral hemorrhage in 1926.

34:23.391 --> 34:25.324
And she was 80 years old.

34:25.326 --> 34:28.728
Now, I was actually able
to get a photo of her.

34:28.730 --> 34:30.063
And this is her when
she was younger.

34:33.268 --> 34:36.870
Could this be the person
influencing Reina?

34:36.871 --> 34:39.105
Yeah, I think so.

34:40.876 --> 34:43.877
And Reina's open
to being influenced

34:43.879 --> 34:45.478
because she's a medium.

34:48.149 --> 34:51.818
I mean, you know,
this makes me sad.

34:53.621 --> 34:55.154
I just feel
for my daughter.

34:55.156 --> 34:57.891
I mean, she said, I don't
want that to happen with her

34:57.893 --> 34:59.426
for the rest of her life.

34:59.428 --> 35:00.560
I mean, as a father,
I can't --

35:00.562 --> 35:01.627
what do I do with that?

35:01.629 --> 35:05.097
You know, it just
drives me crazy.

35:05.099 --> 35:08.434
I'm reaching anxiety,
and my anxiety is like a 14.

35:13.708 --> 35:15.441
So far, you've seen
a lot in this place.

35:15.443 --> 35:16.976
Anything else?

35:16.978 --> 35:19.312
The other deceased person
that I encountered

35:19.314 --> 35:22.182
is a male,
who I really don't like.

35:22.184 --> 35:25.385
I mean, I don't like this guy.

35:25.387 --> 35:28.922
Did not want me here.

35:28.924 --> 35:30.056
****

35:30.058 --> 35:32.592
That was weird.

35:32.594 --> 35:37.196
Like I got a physical push
back on, like, my shoulder.

35:37.198 --> 35:39.665
He was showing me
himself initially

35:39.667 --> 35:41.067
like in his 30s or 40s.

35:41.069 --> 35:43.803
Maybe this is
the widow's husband.

35:43.805 --> 35:45.272
I couldn't be sure.

35:45.274 --> 35:49.075
He's extremely stressed out,
very worried about money

35:49.077 --> 35:51.811
and freaking out about the banks

35:51.813 --> 35:56.149
and the thing that really
stood out to me about him

35:56.151 --> 35:59.619
was that he kept
showing me himself

35:59.621 --> 36:01.888
as, like, some kind of doctor.

36:01.890 --> 36:03.422
Was kind of confused by that

36:03.424 --> 36:08.027
because I kind of saw him
with a lot of dead bodies.

36:08.029 --> 36:10.763
You know, a few things you're
saying are reminding me

36:10.765 --> 36:15.968
not of Louisa Miller's
husband, but of her father.

36:15.970 --> 36:18.038
Now, his name was
Philip Thomas Miller.

36:18.040 --> 36:20.239
So he bought this
property in 1859.

36:20.241 --> 36:22.509
He was 41 at the time
he bought it.

36:22.511 --> 36:24.043
The thing that
caught my attention

36:24.045 --> 36:25.912
was the bodies you mentioned

36:25.914 --> 36:27.447
because Miller was
the warden at the prison

36:27.449 --> 36:30.250
down the street
back in the 1860s.

36:30.252 --> 36:31.784
****

36:31.786 --> 36:34.521
So talking about all the dead
bodies that happened there.

36:34.523 --> 36:36.589
Now, we don't know how
many died under his watch,

36:36.591 --> 36:40.727
but he got into
financial trouble in 1878

36:40.729 --> 36:44.464
and the bank took the
property away from him.

36:44.466 --> 36:48.601
I got a photo of Miller,
but it was later on in life.

36:48.603 --> 36:51.004
Interesting.

36:51.006 --> 36:52.872
So do you think that's who
you saw or you're not sure?

36:52.874 --> 36:55.474
I think so, yeah.

36:55.476 --> 36:57.610
The thing with him is
that he doesn't want

36:57.612 --> 37:00.880
anybody here at all.

37:00.882 --> 37:04.417
He wants living people to
be intimidated and scared.

37:04.419 --> 37:05.952
He's very physical,

37:05.954 --> 37:09.155
so I think you would be
able to see him at times.

37:09.157 --> 37:12.825
So I was thinking like
dark clothes, dark suits.

37:12.827 --> 37:14.427
I was standing in my
daughter's bedroom

37:14.429 --> 37:17.831
and I saw an apparition
of a man with a top hat on

37:17.833 --> 37:21.167
and he had an
old-fashioned black jacket.

37:21.169 --> 37:24.237
That looks a lot
like the guy.

37:24.239 --> 37:30.109
I saw him touching men in
unusual ways with women.

37:30.111 --> 37:33.313
What I saw him doing was
attempting to smother them,

37:33.315 --> 37:34.981
getting up in their faces.

37:34.983 --> 37:38.251
What I did see him
doing as well was...

37:38.253 --> 37:39.785
I'm being charged by this thing.

37:39.787 --> 37:41.253
I don't know what
the **** it is.

37:41.255 --> 37:42.988
What are they seeing?

37:42.990 --> 37:46.992
More of like a black ball thing,
but, like, fast.

37:46.994 --> 37:48.728
They're
and it's in their face,

37:48.730 --> 37:51.131
you know, like
freaking them out.

37:51.133 --> 37:53.866
And I did have a sketch
done of what I saw.

38:03.478 --> 38:05.611
My God.
That makes me want to puke.

38:05.613 --> 38:08.481
****

38:15.691 --> 38:18.691
This happened
to me twice.

38:18.693 --> 38:20.359
And this big black ball

38:20.361 --> 38:22.895
or black thing
hovered on top of me

38:22.897 --> 38:24.164
and it was
smothering me.

38:24.166 --> 38:25.765
Like I couldn't move,
I couldn't breathe,

38:25.767 --> 38:28.568
I couldn't scream,
I couldn't cry out.

38:28.570 --> 38:29.836
This sketch
blows my mind.

38:29.838 --> 38:33.173
She painted this picture,
almost like I was there

38:33.175 --> 38:34.574
and then
you had this drawn.

38:34.576 --> 38:35.975
It's just,
it's incredible.

38:35.977 --> 38:40.646
I don't know what to think,
I really don't.

38:40.648 --> 38:41.915
Alright,
so what's the threat?

38:41.917 --> 38:43.582
What if they didn't
call us, what happens?

38:43.584 --> 38:47.053
Honestly, he could more
than likely kill you.

38:48.657 --> 38:53.592
Probably a good thing you
guys left when you did.

38:53.594 --> 38:56.396
It's a lot to take in.
I mean, it really is.

38:56.398 --> 38:57.663
I was nervous that

38:57.665 --> 39:00.533
it was going to be worse
than what we thought

39:00.535 --> 39:01.934
and it is.

39:22.790 --> 39:27.259
Alright, guys, so now we
know what's in this house.

39:27.261 --> 39:31.997
What was attacking you in bed,
what was jumping on you,

39:31.999 --> 39:34.066
and most of all, what
was influencing Reina.

39:34.068 --> 39:36.268
But we still haven't
answered the big question.

39:36.270 --> 39:37.870
Can you make this
house safe enough

39:37.872 --> 39:41.006
for you to sell
to another family?

39:41.008 --> 39:42.941
For that question, I'm
gonna turn it over to Amy.

39:46.814 --> 39:50.282
The first person that
needs to be dealt with

39:50.284 --> 39:52.618
is the "doctor."

39:52.620 --> 39:54.020
The people that need to do this

39:54.022 --> 39:57.489
is a male and a female medium.

39:57.491 --> 39:59.625
They need to be in the age range

39:59.627 --> 40:04.297
of 40 to 50 years of age
in good physical health.

40:04.299 --> 40:08.767
They need to come together as
a team and at the same time,

40:08.769 --> 40:14.573
they need to engage this
deceased male and move him on.

40:14.575 --> 40:17.309
Why so specific about
age and condition?

40:17.311 --> 40:20.646
If we're leaning
towards younger,

40:20.648 --> 40:22.848
he sees that as weakness.

40:22.850 --> 40:24.116
And if we're going older,

40:24.118 --> 40:27.319
he also perceives
that as a weakness.

40:27.321 --> 40:32.391
The second person that needs
to be dealt with is the widow.

40:32.393 --> 40:35.660
The male medium, he
needs to engage with her

40:35.662 --> 40:37.730
and move her on.

40:37.732 --> 40:40.599
I feel like she will
bow down to a male

40:40.601 --> 40:43.101
giving her this directive.

40:43.103 --> 40:49.275
The third is the father
and son in the attic.

40:49.277 --> 40:53.078
This medium needs to be
more of a grandmother,

40:53.080 --> 40:57.349
nurturing type of
personality, in her 60s.

40:57.351 --> 40:58.351
Why a motherly type?

40:58.353 --> 40:59.952
Because of the situation
with the kid?

40:59.954 --> 41:05.824
Yes, yes, and he'll be calm
with this kind of personality.

41:05.826 --> 41:08.894
Okay, so what can they do
as far as Reina's abilities?

41:08.896 --> 41:12.698
You need to set up barriers
to keep the random dead away.

41:12.700 --> 41:15.768
She's gonna need
a lot of learning.

41:15.770 --> 41:18.303
When is it okay to
talk to the dead?

41:18.305 --> 41:21.039
So it's a process, really.

41:21.041 --> 41:22.240
Right.

41:22.242 --> 41:26.445
This is a doable fix.

41:26.447 --> 41:29.381
Would you consider
moving back in?

41:29.383 --> 41:31.183
I- I can't do it.

41:31.185 --> 41:32.718
That's understandable,
you know,

41:32.720 --> 41:34.987
why go back into a combat zone
if you don't have to, right?

41:34.989 --> 41:37.656
Yes.
I just can't.

41:37.658 --> 41:39.124
My family's more
important to me.

41:39.126 --> 41:41.260
Right, so are you guys
gonna follow Amy's advice

41:41.262 --> 41:43.728
and do what she says so you
can safely sell this house

41:43.730 --> 41:47.066
to someone else?
Yeah.

41:47.068 --> 41:50.403
100%.
I love having a plan.

41:50.405 --> 41:52.671
I'm just really happy
that we have solutions.

41:52.673 --> 41:57.142
I mean, the questions
I had were answered.

41:57.144 --> 41:58.877
It's going to take
a lot of work,

41:58.879 --> 42:01.213
but if these guys
follow my advice,

42:01.215 --> 42:02.615
they can move on the dead,

42:02.617 --> 42:05.484
making it safe to
sell to someone new.

42:08.689 --> 42:11.690
We have been in
contact with a medium

42:11.692 --> 42:13.158
that actually has
been in the house.

42:13.160 --> 42:16.762
And he is in the process
of clearing the home.

42:16.764 --> 42:19.231
Reina and I, we've had a
really good couple of months.

42:19.233 --> 42:21.567
We haven't had anything
in our new house.

42:21.569 --> 42:23.635
In fact, the other day,
she said she's grateful

42:23.637 --> 42:26.372
that she doesn't have anything
scary in her closet anymore.

42:26.374 --> 42:28.573
So anyways, we're really
appreciative of you guys.

42:28.575 --> 42:29.775
Thank you, guys.
