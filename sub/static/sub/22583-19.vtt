00:02.645 --> 00:04.636
Previously on Enterprise.

00:05.365 --> 00:07.003
This is going to happen to me.

00:07.125 --> 00:10.197
It's already started.
I can feel my control slipping away.

00:10.325 --> 00:12.077
We're talking about a one-way trip.

00:12.645 --> 00:13.998
I'll be flying the mission.

00:14.125 --> 00:16.480
I won't order anyone else to die.

00:17.405 --> 00:18.633
You know about the Spheres.

00:18.765 --> 00:21.518
They were constructed
by trans-dimensional beings.

00:21.645 --> 00:23.681
Their purpose is to reconfigure
the Expanse...

00:23.805 --> 00:26.239
to make it habitable for their species.

00:26.365 --> 00:29.277
That's what destroys the Xindi,
not humanity.

00:30.165 --> 00:33.601
We know exactly where your ship is.

00:51.645 --> 00:54.921
Another breach on C-deck!
E-deck's depressurising!

00:57.405 --> 00:59.635
We can't take much more of this!

01:08.845 --> 01:10.642
They've ceased firing.

01:12.245 --> 01:13.997
They're moving off...

01:15.805 --> 01:17.557
back into the system.

01:18.965 --> 01:21.525
Ensign, get us out of here.

01:21.645 --> 01:23.317
Thrusters are down.

01:24.245 --> 01:26.679
I don't think we're going anywhere.

01:30.205 --> 01:32.765
It's been a long road

01:34.365 --> 01:37.118
Gettin' from there to here

01:37.445 --> 01:40.243
It's been a long time

01:41.165 --> 01:44.635
But my time is finally near

01:45.045 --> 01:48.435
And I will see my dream
Come alive at last

01:49.285 --> 01:52.118
I will touch the sky

01:52.525 --> 01:55.995
And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more

01:56.125 --> 01:58.958
No, they're not gonna change my mind

01:59.085 --> 02:03.363
'Cause I've got faith of the heart

02:03.725 --> 02:06.637
I'm going where my heart will take me

02:06.765 --> 02:10.917
I've got faith to believe

02:11.325 --> 02:13.919
I can do anything

02:14.045 --> 02:17.754
I've got strength of the soul

02:18.525 --> 02:21.278
And no one's gonna bend or break me

02:21.405 --> 02:25.603
I can reach any star

02:26.885 --> 02:28.876
I've got faith

02:30.605 --> 02:33.722
I've got faith

02:34.325 --> 02:37.601
Faith of the heart

02:50.965 --> 02:53.843
You had no right to recall my ships.

02:53.965 --> 02:56.843
And you had no authorisation
to launch an attack.

02:57.045 --> 02:59.605
The humans should've been destroyed
when they were detected.

03:00.765 --> 03:02.562
The Council doesn't agree.

03:02.725 --> 03:05.922
You're permitting an enemy vessel
to remain in orbit...

03:06.045 --> 03:07.683
near a military installation!

03:07.805 --> 03:11.241
Their ship is critically damaged.
They no longer pose a threat.

03:11.365 --> 03:13.959
Thanks to an attack that you opposed.

03:14.085 --> 03:17.316
At the very least, we should board
their vessel and take them prisoner.

03:17.445 --> 03:18.673
It is being considered.

03:18.805 --> 03:20.557
On the subject of prisoners...

03:20.685 --> 03:24.041
the Council wants Archer
for further interrogation.

03:24.565 --> 03:25.964
We're not finished with him.

03:26.085 --> 03:28.474
You've questioned him long enough.

03:28.605 --> 03:31.563
He hasn't provided us
with the necessary information.

03:31.685 --> 03:34.483
Perhaps the Council
will have more success.

03:35.285 --> 03:38.083
You're ordered
to release him immediately.

03:39.725 --> 03:40.999
Very well.

03:41.805 --> 03:44.365
We've arranged for his transport.

03:44.965 --> 03:46.398
We can deliver him.

03:46.525 --> 03:49.676
He's already been severely beaten
under your care.

03:51.445 --> 03:54.403
He is the commander
of an enemy vessel.

03:54.525 --> 03:56.993
We need Archer in good condition.

03:57.125 --> 04:00.561
If he can't answer questions,
we can't interrogate him.

04:02.125 --> 04:04.514
He will not be harmed any further.

04:05.765 --> 04:07.835
You have my assurances.

04:08.045 --> 04:10.115
That isn't good enough.

04:10.925 --> 04:12.119
Meaning?

04:12.645 --> 04:16.433
It wouldn't be the first
of your assurances that fell short.

04:16.885 --> 04:20.673
The Council has agreed that
the Aquatics will transport the prisoner.

04:20.805 --> 04:23.273
They've sent a ship. Get him ready.

04:37.765 --> 04:41.724
The com system's still down. We don't
have a complete casualty list yet.

04:41.845 --> 04:43.915
But so far, the news isn't good.

04:44.045 --> 04:46.798
Five people are confirmed dead,
dozens wounded.

04:46.925 --> 04:50.315
Most of the hull breaches have been
contained with emergency bulkheads.

04:50.445 --> 04:52.083
What about Cargo Bay 2?

04:52.205 --> 04:54.594
I don't know. There's no way to get to it.

04:54.725 --> 04:56.841
A large portion of E-deck
is still decompressed.

04:56.965 --> 04:57.954
Weapons?

04:58.085 --> 05:01.521
The aft torpedo launcher's working,
but that's about it.

05:02.485 --> 05:05.397
I really don't know
what's holding us together...

05:05.525 --> 05:07.720
but let's hope it doesn't give out.

05:11.845 --> 05:13.073
Commander.

05:13.205 --> 05:16.197
The primary warp coil's fried.
It has to be rebuilt from scratch.

05:16.325 --> 05:17.280
How long?

05:17.405 --> 05:20.044
A couple of weeks if we had the parts.
We don't.

05:20.165 --> 05:22.395
As it stands now,
warp drive's out of the question.

05:22.525 --> 05:23.560
Impulse?

05:23.685 --> 05:26.358
I'll have to inspect the hull
around the exhaust manifolds.

05:26.485 --> 05:28.441
See the damage firsthand.

05:28.965 --> 05:30.603
Make it a priority.

05:30.725 --> 05:32.397
We've had a lot of injuries down here.

05:32.525 --> 05:35.437
It'll speed things up
if you assign me some extra help.

05:39.245 --> 05:41.600
Engineering isn't the safest place
to be right now.

05:41.725 --> 05:44.717
Indeed. We've already lost
one captain today.

06:38.445 --> 06:40.356
Where are you taking me?

06:52.725 --> 06:54.795
Emergency power's back on-line.

06:54.925 --> 06:56.836
We'll have phase cannons
in about an hour.

06:56.965 --> 06:58.842
I'd like you to begin repairs on E-deck.

06:58.965 --> 07:00.796
I'll have to pull people
from other areas.

07:00.925 --> 07:03.564
There are engineering components
in Cargo Bay 2.

07:03.685 --> 07:05.641
They're crucial to Cdr. Tucker's repairs.

07:05.765 --> 07:06.800
Aye.

07:09.045 --> 07:11.195
There's a vessel approaching.

07:11.485 --> 07:13.840
- It's Xindi.
- Aft torpedoes.

07:14.205 --> 07:15.433
Targeting.

07:15.565 --> 07:17.317
- The viewscreen?
- Still off-line.

07:17.445 --> 07:21.040
It appears to be a one-man vessel.
No armaments.

07:22.205 --> 07:23.479
Bio-signs?

07:24.325 --> 07:25.360
One.

07:28.445 --> 07:29.798
Bring it in.

07:46.925 --> 07:47.994
Here.

08:00.445 --> 08:04.074
No internal injuries, numerous
contusions consistent with blunt trauma.

08:04.205 --> 08:06.002
How many have we lost?

08:07.205 --> 08:08.354
Fourteen.

08:09.765 --> 08:11.756
Three are unaccounted for.

08:17.965 --> 08:19.842
Don't waste time on me.

08:20.925 --> 08:23.393
It's good to see you again, Captain.

08:26.165 --> 08:27.598
Damage report.

08:31.565 --> 08:34.159
We'll have impulse power in six hours.

08:41.284 --> 08:45.437
Aft torpedo launchers and one
forward phase cannon are on-line.

08:46.485 --> 08:49.682
Have Hoshi and Travis
start analysing that pod.

08:51.045 --> 08:53.764
Its configuration suggests it's Aquatic.

08:54.725 --> 08:57.876
I was aboard one of their ships.
That's the last thing I remember.

08:58.005 --> 09:00.200
Do you have any idea
why they released you?

09:00.325 --> 09:03.442
I think I may have gotten through
to one of them.

09:03.565 --> 09:04.680
Degra.

09:11.685 --> 09:12.720
Thanks.

09:16.285 --> 09:17.923
Are you all right?

09:18.285 --> 09:19.559
I'm fine.

09:23.325 --> 09:26.044
I should help Lt. Reed with his repairs.

10:32.805 --> 10:34.716
They went to a lot of trouble
to let you go.

10:34.845 --> 10:36.676
You really think they'll attack us again?

10:36.805 --> 10:38.875
They're not exactly unified.

10:39.085 --> 10:41.838
The Reptilians came after us
on their own.

10:41.965 --> 10:44.160
They might decide to finish
what they started.

10:44.285 --> 10:46.924
We've run out of moons
to hide behind...

10:47.045 --> 10:50.321
but there is a cometary dust cloud
not too far off.

10:50.525 --> 10:51.640
T'Pol?

10:52.085 --> 10:55.634
The diamagnetic fields should shield us
from long-range scans.

10:55.765 --> 10:56.834
How far away is it?

10:56.965 --> 10:58.193
Engineering to the Bridge.

10:58.325 --> 11:00.998
We just picked up a surge
in the EPS grid on A-deck.

11:07.285 --> 11:09.162
Thanks for the warning.

11:11.205 --> 11:12.399
How far?

11:12.525 --> 11:15.164
At the present speed, about three days.

11:15.965 --> 11:17.762
- Set a course.
- Aye, sir.

11:17.885 --> 11:20.479
Instead of hiding,
shouldn't we be looking for the weapon?

11:20.605 --> 11:21.924
Sensors are still off-line.

11:22.045 --> 11:24.957
Let's focus on
getting ourselves operational.

11:25.085 --> 11:28.839
We can't mount a search
with a ship coming down on our heads.

11:36.605 --> 11:38.800
I thought Insectoid was tough.

11:41.405 --> 11:43.361
Almost sounds like music.

11:46.525 --> 11:49.642
My mother always wanted me
to take piano lessons.

11:49.925 --> 11:51.881
I should've listened to her.

11:52.005 --> 11:55.281
It's never too late.
You can start when we get home.

11:57.685 --> 11:59.357
We're getting home.

12:04.445 --> 12:06.436
What makes you think
we can trust this guy?

12:06.565 --> 12:08.123
- Who?
- Degra.

12:08.485 --> 12:11.283
He seems like the last person
who'd come around to our side.

12:11.405 --> 12:12.997
I mean, he designed the weapon.

12:13.125 --> 12:15.116
He may not be on our side...

12:15.245 --> 12:18.282
but I get the feeling
he's starting to question his.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.600
Well, let's hope you're right.

12:21.125 --> 12:23.593
I think we're ready to fire this up.

12:35.045 --> 12:36.319
Maybe not.

12:36.445 --> 12:38.322
Bridge to Capt. Archer.

12:40.525 --> 12:41.674
Go ahead.

12:41.805 --> 12:43.921
There's an unidentified vessel
approaching.

12:44.045 --> 12:45.842
They're asking for our assistance.

12:45.965 --> 12:49.241
- Any details?
- Just that they've taken heavy damage.

12:49.645 --> 12:50.964
Join the club.

12:51.085 --> 12:53.838
- How long till they get here?
- 12 minutes.

12:55.245 --> 12:57.156
Set a rendezvous course.

12:58.605 --> 13:00.402
Maybe we can help each other.

13:07.645 --> 13:10.113
They've minimal weapons,
all powered down.

13:10.245 --> 13:13.555
I'm detecting numerous
spatial anomalies in the area.

13:13.845 --> 13:15.961
Can you get us through them?

13:16.325 --> 13:17.644
I believe so.

13:17.765 --> 13:19.039
Hail them.

13:20.725 --> 13:22.477
This is Capt. Archer.

13:23.365 --> 13:25.959
We're responding to your distress call.

13:26.085 --> 13:27.518
Thank you for coming.

13:27.645 --> 13:31.524
But be aware, this region contains
dangerous spatial distortions.

13:31.645 --> 13:33.681
We're run into them before.

13:33.965 --> 13:36.240
They've damaged our engines
and life support.

13:36.365 --> 13:39.562
We would appreciate
whatever assistance you can give us.

13:39.685 --> 13:41.641
We'll see what we can do.

13:46.805 --> 13:49.797
- What brings you to this system?
- Curiosity.

13:50.405 --> 13:52.555
We're studying the red giant.

13:52.765 --> 13:56.235
It's the first one we've had
the opportunity to explore.

13:56.365 --> 13:59.994
We weren't prepared for these
"spatial anomalies" as you call them.

14:00.125 --> 14:01.558
It seems you weren't, either.

14:01.685 --> 14:05.200
- Actually, this is all the result of combat.
- Combat?

14:05.405 --> 14:07.396
Have you heard of a species
called the Xindi?

14:07.525 --> 14:10.085
No, we're new to this region of space.

14:10.205 --> 14:11.923
Let's talk about your ship.

14:12.045 --> 14:14.161
We know a way to insulate
against the anomalies.

14:14.285 --> 14:15.877
There's a substance called trellium-D.

14:16.005 --> 14:18.565
I've heard of it. It's extremely rare.

14:18.805 --> 14:21.558
I have 60 kilos sitting in my cargo bay.

14:21.725 --> 14:23.602
Perhaps we can work out
some sort of trade.

14:23.725 --> 14:24.794
That's what I had in mind.

14:24.925 --> 14:28.156
Given the condition of my vessel,
I don't know what we can offer you.

14:28.285 --> 14:30.116
Our warp engine is badly damaged.

14:30.245 --> 14:33.794
We could probably spare a few plasma
injectors, maybe some antimatter.

14:33.925 --> 14:37.042
I was thinking more along the lines of
a warp coil.

14:37.165 --> 14:39.963
I'm afraid that's one thing
we can't spare.

14:40.085 --> 14:42.394
Maybe we can make it worth your while.

14:42.525 --> 14:45.483
We have certain technology
that you'd probably find useful.

14:45.685 --> 14:49.200
Without a warp coil, the journey back
to our system would take three years.

14:49.325 --> 14:51.316
We're not equipped for a voyage
of that length.

14:51.445 --> 14:53.800
The Xindi have wiped out
seven million of my people.

14:53.925 --> 14:56.485
Now they're building a weapon
to destroy our entire world.

14:56.605 --> 14:58.323
I have to stop them.

14:58.605 --> 15:01.073
Without warp drive, I won't succeed.

15:01.725 --> 15:03.522
I sympathise, Captain.

15:04.925 --> 15:07.075
I will help you in any other way.

15:07.245 --> 15:10.715
But I won't jeopardise
the lives of my crew. I'm sorry.

19:29.005 --> 19:31.041
The escape pod
can manoeuvre underwater.

19:31.165 --> 19:33.474
Aside from that,
nothing out of the ordinary.

19:33.605 --> 19:35.163
I've gone through the data banks...

19:35.285 --> 19:38.083
just your standard navigation
and operational files.

19:38.205 --> 19:40.400
But I did find one document.

19:40.645 --> 19:43.842
An engineer asking the supervisors
for additional parts.

19:43.965 --> 19:45.842
Here's the translation.

19:53.285 --> 19:55.480
The names of these supervisors.

19:55.605 --> 19:57.357
Piral, Jaina, Trenia.

19:57.845 --> 20:00.040
The names of Degra's children.

20:05.045 --> 20:08.674
I discovered a set of coordinates
embedded in the document.

20:11.925 --> 20:13.802
It's not a star system.

20:14.725 --> 20:17.114
There was another embedded number.

20:18.445 --> 20:20.959
A stardate, three days from now.

20:23.405 --> 20:26.795
- How far away are the coordinates?
- Four light years.

20:30.245 --> 20:33.203
We'll need at least Warp 3
to make it in time.

20:33.925 --> 20:37.235
It's unlikely that Degra
will wait beyond three days.

20:57.485 --> 20:58.964
He's all yours.

21:00.445 --> 21:03.084
He was the perfect houseguest,
as usual.

21:05.965 --> 21:09.799
You'll be happy to know I discharged
Ensign Ansara this morning.

21:09.925 --> 21:13.804
And Corporal O'Malley
will be returning to duty this afternoon.

21:15.805 --> 21:16.954
Captain?

21:21.645 --> 21:25.684
Hard to imagine that we'll ever
get this ship back the way it was.

21:27.165 --> 21:29.440
It's a simple matter of repairs.

21:32.045 --> 21:34.240
Well, perhaps not that simple.

21:36.165 --> 21:40.556
Somehow, I don't think it's the damage
to Enterprise that's troubling you.

21:47.565 --> 21:49.840
How long have you been a doctor?

21:50.285 --> 21:52.196
Nearly 40 years.

22:00.365 --> 22:02.242
And in all that time...

22:04.605 --> 22:07.836
did you ever do anything
you thought was unethical?

22:15.365 --> 22:16.480
Twice.

22:17.605 --> 22:18.640
Why?

22:22.845 --> 22:25.120
I'm about to step over a line.

22:27.205 --> 22:29.765
A line I thought I would never cross.

22:30.485 --> 22:33.079
And given the nature of our mission...

22:33.685 --> 22:35.880
it probably won't be the last.

22:40.645 --> 22:42.044
Probably not.

22:44.685 --> 22:47.245
May I ask what you're planning to do?

22:52.525 --> 22:54.755
There could be more casualties.

22:58.685 --> 23:00.118
I'll be ready.

23:21.165 --> 23:23.440
Put together an armed boarding party.

23:23.565 --> 23:27.160
- Who are we boarding, sir?
- The alien ship we docked with.

23:27.485 --> 23:29.157
I don't understand.

23:29.765 --> 23:31.676
We need their warp coil.

23:31.805 --> 23:35.514
They won't give it to us,
so we're going to have to take it.

23:38.725 --> 23:41.000
- Captain.
- Get your men together!

23:48.765 --> 23:51.233
Where are the other members
of the Council?

23:51.365 --> 23:53.321
We didn't want them here.

23:53.565 --> 23:54.554
Why?

23:54.685 --> 23:58.644
We've learned something about
the Reptilians that concerns us.

23:59.485 --> 24:01.680
There's distrust amongst you.

24:02.725 --> 24:04.716
You can help alleviate it.

24:05.965 --> 24:07.159
Continue.

24:07.285 --> 24:10.994
We were told the Reptilians
attempted to build a bio-weapon.

24:11.125 --> 24:12.763
Who told you this?

24:12.885 --> 24:17.003
We've also learned that they were
building this bio-weapon in the past...

24:17.125 --> 24:18.353
on Earth.

24:18.485 --> 24:19.998
As far as we're aware...

24:20.125 --> 24:24.038
Reptilians don't possess
the technology for time travel.

24:24.805 --> 24:27.638
You want to know if they had my help.

24:27.885 --> 24:29.113
Did they?

24:31.285 --> 24:32.274
Yes.

24:32.765 --> 24:35.643
After you prohibited them
from constructing the bio-weapon...

24:35.765 --> 24:39.678
the Reptilians and the Insectoids were
prepared to withdraw from the Council.

24:39.805 --> 24:42.365
I assisted them
so the Council would remain unified.

24:42.485 --> 24:45.318
You helped them to circumvent
our authority.

24:45.525 --> 24:47.959
I protected your authority...

24:48.085 --> 24:50.280
by keeping the Council intact.

24:51.045 --> 24:52.683
What happened to the bio-weapon?

24:52.805 --> 24:54.397
It was never completed...

24:54.525 --> 24:57.278
and the three Reptilians
were never found.

24:57.645 --> 24:59.442
You can't locate them?

25:00.005 --> 25:03.122
There are limits to what we can do
in your realm.

25:03.245 --> 25:05.076
It seems you can do
more than we thought.

25:05.205 --> 25:08.003
Is it true your species built the Spheres?

25:08.165 --> 25:11.953
What makes you think you can
subject me to this interrogation?

25:12.885 --> 25:14.955
If it weren't for my assistance...

25:15.085 --> 25:18.316
your species would be
facing destruction.

25:18.445 --> 25:21.164
We're grateful for the help
that you've given us.

25:21.285 --> 25:22.718
Then prove it.

25:23.005 --> 25:25.075
Focus on the task at hand.

25:25.245 --> 25:27.236
The weapon is nearly complete.

25:27.365 --> 25:29.560
If you permit yourselves
to become distracted...

25:29.685 --> 25:32.324
you'll fail to destroy your real enemy...

25:32.725 --> 25:34.602
the enemy of all Xindi.

25:35.165 --> 25:39.283
Don't summon me again unless
every member of the Council is present.

25:39.525 --> 25:42.323
I won't help fuel your internal bickering.

25:47.485 --> 25:49.874
- You don't believe her.
- Do you?

25:51.165 --> 25:53.963
Why should we take Archer's word
over hers?

25:54.085 --> 25:56.918
Because Archer offered something
she hasn't.

25:58.765 --> 25:59.880
Proof.

26:06.725 --> 26:09.478
Under normal circumstances,
they'd be no match for us.

26:09.605 --> 26:12.881
But we've sustained a lot more damage
than they have.

26:13.005 --> 26:14.563
This could be risky.

26:14.685 --> 26:16.437
One lucky shot to our starboard nacelle.

26:16.565 --> 26:19.033
Let's make sure
they don't get any lucky shots.

26:19.165 --> 26:21.998
Why don't we just transport
their warp coil to Enterprise?

26:22.125 --> 26:24.241
It's tied into their injector system.

26:24.365 --> 26:27.641
If we use the transporter,
we'd destroy their engines.

26:27.765 --> 26:30.723
I've got to get in there,
decouple it by hand.

26:30.965 --> 26:32.193
How long?

26:33.845 --> 26:35.801
10 minutes, give or take.

26:35.925 --> 26:37.445
Can't tell for sure until I see it.

26:37.445 --> 26:37.877
Can't tell for sure until I see it.

26:38.005 --> 26:41.554
If they fight back,
10 minutes could be a very long time.

26:42.285 --> 26:44.480
Perhaps we should
reconsider negotiation.

26:44.605 --> 26:48.200
We can't risk tipping them off.
We have to take them by surprise.

26:48.325 --> 26:51.044
That'll reduce the losses on both sides.

26:51.365 --> 26:53.640
We'll disable their ship
as quickly as we can...

26:53.765 --> 26:56.962
beam over, extract the warp coil,
and get out.

26:58.045 --> 27:00.400
Hopefully without any casualties.

27:03.205 --> 27:04.604
Set a course.

27:09.205 --> 27:12.038
- Can I have a word with you?
- Not right now.

27:14.125 --> 27:15.922
If I had another option, I'd take it.

27:16.045 --> 27:18.479
We're no different than the marauders
who attacked us...

27:18.605 --> 27:20.721
when we entered the Expanse.

27:25.485 --> 27:26.634
We're a lot different.

27:26.765 --> 27:30.678
By stealing their warp coil,
we could be condemning them to death.

27:30.805 --> 27:35.321
We're going to leave them a supply of
trellium, along with some extra food.

27:35.685 --> 27:37.801
I'm not saying it'll be easy for them...

27:37.925 --> 27:40.200
but they'll stand a decent chance
of making it home.

27:40.325 --> 27:43.044
You're forgetting that
we're in a dangerous region of space.

27:43.165 --> 27:45.963
Our assault could cripple
their ability to defend themselves.

27:46.085 --> 27:49.077
- Not if we do it right.
- And what if something goes wrong?

27:49.205 --> 27:52.356
We can debate this all day.
I've made my decision.

27:53.445 --> 27:57.518
"We can't save humanity without
holding on to what makes us human."

27:58.845 --> 28:00.915
Those were your words to me.

28:01.045 --> 28:04.879
I'm no happier doing this than you are
but we're not going to make a habit of it.

28:05.005 --> 28:07.041
Once you rationalise the first misstep...

28:07.165 --> 28:09.156
it's easy to fall into
a pattern of behaviour.

28:09.285 --> 28:10.513
I'm not rationalising anything.

28:10.645 --> 28:13.796
- I know what I'm doing.
- I can't justify this course of action.

28:13.925 --> 28:16.997
- We don't have a choice.
- I won't let you do it!

28:20.965 --> 28:23.559
We've had our share
of disagreements...

28:24.925 --> 28:27.997
but you've never taken it out
on my desk before.

28:29.565 --> 28:30.918
I apologise.

28:31.885 --> 28:33.796
What's happening to you?

28:38.645 --> 28:40.875
It's been a difficult few days.

28:42.845 --> 28:45.279
I haven't had the time to meditate.

28:47.045 --> 28:49.275
Maybe you should find the time.

28:50.925 --> 28:52.916
I didn't mean what I said.

28:53.645 --> 28:55.363
I'm glad to hear it.

28:59.965 --> 29:02.399
I'll be leading the boarding party.

29:03.805 --> 29:05.921
There's no margin for error.

29:09.205 --> 29:12.436
If we don't do this right,
people are going to die.

29:13.885 --> 29:15.841
We need you on the Bridge.

29:17.165 --> 29:18.484
Understood.

29:30.925 --> 29:33.678
- Doctor.
- Yes, this will just take a moment.

29:33.805 --> 29:35.124
What is it?

29:42.485 --> 29:46.194
There's a good deal of residual
trellium in your bloodstream.

29:46.325 --> 29:48.714
How long have you been doing this?

29:49.805 --> 29:51.204
Three months.

29:52.805 --> 29:55.922
I need to know precisely
what has been happening.

30:01.285 --> 30:04.482
When I was exposed to trellium
aboard the Seleya...

30:07.125 --> 30:10.356
it affected me in a way
that I wasn't prepared for.

30:11.045 --> 30:13.957
As I recall,
you were homicidal and paranoid.

30:14.525 --> 30:16.561
The initial effects were...

30:17.525 --> 30:20.483
overwhelming,
but as they began to wear off...

30:22.205 --> 30:25.038
I discovered
I was able to access certain...

30:26.405 --> 30:27.633
emotions.

30:29.565 --> 30:30.998
I wanted more.

30:32.845 --> 30:36.599
I began to experiment
by ingesting small amounts of trellium.

30:37.565 --> 30:41.524
I devised a way to inject it
into my bloodstream.

30:41.645 --> 30:45.354
You must have known it was dangerous.
Trellium exposure is deadly to Vulcans.

30:45.485 --> 30:47.919
It eats away at the neural pathways.

30:48.045 --> 30:51.003
I thought, in small amounts,
it would be safe.

30:52.285 --> 30:55.038
At first, I was able to control
the new emotions...

30:55.165 --> 30:57.884
my interactions with the crew improved.

30:58.725 --> 31:00.681
Cdr. Tucker, for example.

31:01.885 --> 31:04.957
When did you realise
you were becoming addicted?

31:05.205 --> 31:06.604
Two days ago.

31:08.485 --> 31:12.398
The damage to E-deck made it
impossible to access the cargo bay.

31:12.885 --> 31:16.594
I began experiencing agitation, anxiety...

31:17.845 --> 31:19.563
withdrawal symptoms.

31:20.165 --> 31:22.520
You're not experiencing them now?

31:22.725 --> 31:25.193
I was able to retrieve the trellium.

31:26.325 --> 31:28.759
I was almost killed in the process.

31:29.605 --> 31:31.960
This will help stabilise
your synaptic pathways...

31:32.085 --> 31:35.475
but the withdrawal symptoms
will return in a few days.

31:38.805 --> 31:42.161
It's going to take time. It won't be easy.

31:45.125 --> 31:46.524
I understand.

31:47.365 --> 31:48.923
Archer to T'Pol.

31:53.525 --> 31:54.560
Go ahead.

31:54.685 --> 31:57.916
We're approaching the vessel.
Report to the Bridge.

31:58.125 --> 31:59.160
I'm on my way.

31:59.285 --> 32:01.879
You should remain here for observation.

32:02.005 --> 32:04.678
The Captain needs me. I have to go.

32:08.165 --> 32:11.953
I expect you to report back here
at the first sign of trouble.

32:14.725 --> 32:17.717
Are you going to discuss this
with the Captain?

32:18.285 --> 32:21.163
This is between you and your doctor.

32:34.725 --> 32:35.999
Good luck.

32:45.485 --> 32:47.203
You have the Bridge.

32:55.085 --> 32:56.643
Standby weapons.

33:15.285 --> 33:16.354
Run another test.

33:16.485 --> 33:19.795
If it doesn't hold,
we'll bypass the entire assembly.

33:22.125 --> 33:23.114
What is it?

33:23.245 --> 33:26.681
Sir, there's a vessel approaching.
It's the Earth ship.

33:26.965 --> 33:30.116
- Have you contacted them?
- They're not responding.

33:30.965 --> 33:32.921
They're still hailing us.

33:33.085 --> 33:34.564
200 kilometres.

33:35.765 --> 33:38.359
- Target their propulsion systems.
- Aye.

33:39.165 --> 33:40.234
Fire.

33:46.965 --> 33:50.241
Their warp drive's off-line.
They're charging weapons.

33:50.365 --> 33:53.004
- Bridge to transporter.
- They're firing.

33:53.125 --> 33:54.353
Energise.

34:24.245 --> 34:26.121
That's the access port.

34:28.205 --> 34:28.925
Stun grenade.

34:28.925 --> 34:29.596
Stun grenade.

34:41.965 --> 34:43.114
Go!

34:54.045 --> 34:56.001
Their weapons are at 50%.

34:56.804 --> 34:59.273
We've another hull breach on E-deck.

35:00.765 --> 35:03.916
- Our port thrusters are off-line.
- We have to take out their weapons.

35:04.045 --> 35:05.364
We can't leave them defenceless.

35:05.485 --> 35:07.715
If we want to get through this,
we have no choice.

35:07.845 --> 35:09.597
The Captain's orders.

35:12.565 --> 35:13.680
Clear!

35:34.565 --> 35:35.680
Cover.

35:44.045 --> 35:45.319
- Archer.
- Captain.

35:45.485 --> 35:46.679
We've hit a little snag.

35:47.285 --> 35:49.401
They're targeting our starboard nacelle.

35:49.525 --> 35:51.163
Evasive manoeuvres.

35:52.725 --> 35:53.874
T'Pol to the Captain.

35:55.765 --> 35:57.596
- Go ahead.
- We're taking heavy damage.

35:57.725 --> 35:59.761
There's a forcefield
around the warp coil.

35:59.885 --> 36:01.682
Trip's trying to disable it.

36:04.445 --> 36:05.764
Try it now.

36:28.485 --> 36:30.157
- Archer to Enterprise.
- Go ahead.

36:30.285 --> 36:31.923
Parson's been hit.

36:32.365 --> 36:34.560
Lock onto her com signal
and beam her out of here.

36:34.685 --> 36:36.004
Lieutenant.

36:37.245 --> 36:39.634
We're venting atmosphere on C-deck!

36:39.765 --> 36:40.880
T'Pol!

36:43.285 --> 36:46.402
Adjust phase-cannons
to a narrow confinement beam.

36:46.645 --> 36:49.113
- Target this power juncture.
- Got it.

36:49.365 --> 36:50.434
Fire.

37:02.445 --> 37:03.798
Right there.

37:21.285 --> 37:22.513
Archer.

37:22.645 --> 37:24.761
Cdr. Tucker's aboard. We have it.

37:24.965 --> 37:26.876
Stand by to beam us out.

37:29.045 --> 37:30.319
Fall back.

37:40.685 --> 37:43.518
What you can't have, you take by force?

37:43.765 --> 37:47.360
We've beamed three containers
of trellium into your cargo hold...

37:47.485 --> 37:48.998
as compensation.

37:49.125 --> 37:51.275
There's also food and supplies.

37:51.405 --> 37:54.158
You're stranding us
three years from home.

37:54.765 --> 37:56.642
Why are you doing this?

37:56.965 --> 37:58.921
Because I have no choice.

38:01.405 --> 38:02.599
Energise.

38:20.005 --> 38:22.565
I'm not sure why I asked you
to come see me.

38:22.685 --> 38:25.153
Perhaps you just needed
some company.

38:26.045 --> 38:27.239
Perhaps.

38:33.045 --> 38:34.603
How do you feel?

38:39.645 --> 38:43.479
I thought that without the trellium,
I would no longer have difficulty...

38:43.605 --> 38:45.516
suppressing my emotions.

38:46.805 --> 38:48.523
But that's not true.

38:55.765 --> 38:58.199
It's not surprising
that there are residual effects.

38:58.325 --> 39:00.714
- They're probably temporary.
- And if they're not?

39:00.845 --> 39:03.279
Then you'll learn to cope with them.

39:03.405 --> 39:05.680
I'm not certain I'll be able to.

39:06.365 --> 39:07.514
I'm...

39:08.405 --> 39:09.554
Afraid?

39:10.325 --> 39:12.520
Vulcans don't experience fear.

39:13.525 --> 39:15.481
You sought these emotions.

39:15.605 --> 39:18.642
Don't expect them to vanish overnight.
Patience.

39:23.365 --> 39:25.720
A few tweaks and it fit right in.

39:26.045 --> 39:28.081
- What's our top speed?
- 3.2.

39:28.965 --> 39:32.753
That should get us to
the rendezvous point with time to spare.

39:37.965 --> 39:39.876
You did the right thing.

39:41.685 --> 39:46.201
Seems the longer we're here, the more
I have to keep saying that to myself.

39:47.285 --> 39:50.834
Those people will be okay.
They'll get home.

39:54.005 --> 39:56.360
- Captain to the Bridge.
- Go ahead.

39:58.325 --> 40:01.078
- Prepare to go to maximum warp.
- Aye, sir.
