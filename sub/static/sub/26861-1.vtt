00:33.943 --> 00:36.279
<i>I'm from American Samoa.</i>

00:37.780 --> 00:42.368
<i>American Samoa is, like, the breeding
ground for military soldiers.</i>

00:44.329 --> 00:49.290
<i>Joining the military almost carries
the same principles as my culture:</i>

00:49.292 --> 00:51.711
<i>duty, respect, honor.</i>

00:54.839 --> 00:57.383
<i>I wanted to follow in the
footsteps of my family.</i>

01:01.054 --> 01:04.766
They actually didn't want us to join,
but here we are, joining.

01:05.892 --> 01:10.188
And, uh, we can actually see
why they didn't want us to join.

01:12.232 --> 01:14.526
It actually, uh, sucks.

01:16.986 --> 01:19.862
<i>I was deployed to Afghanistan
several times,</i>

01:19.864 --> 01:22.492
so all over Afghanistan.

01:23.827 --> 01:25.203
Mm-hmm.

01:26.037 --> 01:29.288
<i>It was in, uh, '08, '09,</i>

01:29.290 --> 01:33.169
<i>and an IED that was meant
for us... blew.</i>

01:34.671 --> 01:36.673
<i>And we raced over to help out.</i>

01:38.550 --> 01:41.926
<i>The, uh, vehicles that were involved</i>

01:41.928 --> 01:44.681
<i>ended up to be
my battle buddy's vehicle.</i>

01:46.015 --> 01:49.851
<i>My battle buddy was stuck
inside the vehicle,</i>

01:49.853 --> 01:52.687
<i>and there was no way to get him out.</i>

01:52.689 --> 01:55.398
<i>There were flames all around it,</i>

01:55.400 --> 01:58.484
<i>and we were able
to put it out the first time,</i>

01:58.486 --> 02:00.905
<i>and then the second time,
we couldn't.</i>

02:03.032 --> 02:05.493
And the second time
is when he woke up.

02:07.245 --> 02:09.830
And we had to listen to him scream.

02:15.503 --> 02:20.383
The worst sound that you ever had
to have your soldiers listen to.

02:26.931 --> 02:28.391
I need a break.

02:31.144 --> 02:34.520
People have told me, "Sergeant
A.V., you need some help."

02:34.522 --> 02:39.400
<i>But it wasn't until I
handcuffed my first sergeant...</i>

02:39.402 --> 02:41.527
<i>I don't remember doing this,
but I patted him down</i>

02:41.529 --> 02:43.404
<i>and threw him into a corner.</i>

02:43.406 --> 02:46.032
<i>And it wasn't until I came to
and asked him,</i>

02:46.034 --> 02:49.287
"What are you doing there?"
And he said, uh...

02:50.580 --> 02:54.209
"You did this to me, you asshole."
And I was, like, "Oh."

02:55.960 --> 03:01.508
<i>That was when I realized, "Well,
shoot. Yeah, okay, I got a problem."</i>

03:03.051 --> 03:04.677
PTSD.

03:07.013 --> 03:10.181
<i>That's actually why
I shy away from places,</i>

03:10.183 --> 03:12.767
<i>'Cause I don't want
people to view me as,</i>

03:12.769 --> 03:15.353
"Oh, there's that crazy vet."
You know?

03:15.355 --> 03:17.273
I'm not crazy, it's just...

03:18.900 --> 03:21.694
certain things happen to my bo...
I have zero control over.

03:23.822 --> 03:27.534
I feel a little... used.

03:29.911 --> 03:33.871
<i>And I understand that the
military has to keep rolling.</i>

03:33.873 --> 03:37.333
But I also feel that they should
take care of the people...

03:37.335 --> 03:40.004
that... that they break.

03:42.006 --> 03:44.132
<i>There was a promise...</i>

03:44.134 --> 03:46.676
<i>that if we gave our all,</i>

03:46.678 --> 03:50.429
<i>that they would make sure that
we were well taken care of.</i>

03:50.431 --> 03:52.058
And I don't feel that.

04:02.944 --> 04:05.987
We Are Not Done Yet
<i>is collaborative poems</i>

04:05.989 --> 04:09.782
<i>from different branches
of the military:</i>

04:09.784 --> 04:12.702
<i>Army, Air Force,</i>

04:12.704 --> 04:14.537
<i>Marines,</i>

04:14.539 --> 04:16.289
<i>Navy.</i>

04:16.291 --> 04:18.374
<i>Veterans, active.</i>

04:18.375 --> 04:21.627
<i>And we were speaking
about different traumas,</i>

04:21.629 --> 04:25.882
<i>letting everybody know that these
things may have happened to us,</i>

04:25.884 --> 04:28.676
<i>but we are not done yet.</i>

04:28.678 --> 04:30.720
<i>We still have a lot to say,</i>

04:30.722 --> 04:32.807
<i>and we still have a lot to do.</i>

04:35.852 --> 04:40.062
<i>A.V. had this idea to find
a way to talk about</i>

04:40.064 --> 04:42.356
PTSD in the military.

04:42.358 --> 04:48.613
<i>And </i> We're Not Done Yet <i>was his way</i>
<i>of bringing his community together.</i>

04:48.615 --> 04:51.199
All of us were going through

04:51.201 --> 04:54.786
<i>different phases
of dealing with trauma.</i>

04:54.788 --> 04:56.579
<i>We all met through Seema,</i>

04:56.581 --> 04:58.539
like, doing those writing workshops.

04:58.541 --> 05:01.501
So, three options to think about...

05:01.503 --> 05:04.629
<i>We have a group of veterans,
and active duty service members</i>

05:04.631 --> 05:08.508
that gather regularly to write
and share their stories,

05:08.510 --> 05:11.385
<i>and, through that process,
came to see overlap</i>

05:11.387 --> 05:14.430
<i>between their individual
experiences of trauma,</i>

05:14.432 --> 05:16.724
<i>and decided to write
a collaborative poem</i>

05:16.726 --> 05:18.351
and turn it into a performance.

05:18.353 --> 05:20.978
"Remove the aggression,
insert pen..."

05:20.980 --> 05:25.900
<i>We wanted to explain that
there's so much more to</i>

05:25.902 --> 05:29.487
the military story
than shooting people.

05:29.489 --> 05:32.990
And there's all these
things that people deal with

05:32.992 --> 05:36.079
in between, like,
bullets and Band-Aids.

05:41.709 --> 05:45.962
Our lines are going to be
"Everyday I..."

05:45.964 --> 05:48.214
"I used to believe..."

05:48.216 --> 05:50.466
"On the horizon..."

05:50.468 --> 05:54.512
"And maybe there
will never be enough...

05:54.514 --> 05:56.889
This poem is not..."

05:56.891 --> 05:59.976
<i>The collaborative poem
was a bunch of initial</i>

05:59.978 --> 06:02.395
<i>prompts that we were
to fill in the blank with.</i>

06:02.397 --> 06:04.522
And it allowed us to...

06:04.524 --> 06:07.692
really reach across the spectrum
of trauma as a whole.

06:07.694 --> 06:10.071
"I used to believe..."
A.V., you wanna start?

06:11.114 --> 06:15.950
"I used to believe that there was
honor in things that I have done."

06:15.952 --> 06:17.994
"These hands have...

06:17.996 --> 06:20.913
"saved and given life,
held a newborn child,

06:20.915 --> 06:23.875
"taken chemo pills,
delivered a hot plate of love

06:23.877 --> 06:25.751
on a cold day."

06:25.753 --> 06:29.130
"On the horizon
is the vanishing point.

06:29.132 --> 06:33.885
"And maybe if I can reach it,
all these old voices can go quiet.

06:33.887 --> 06:35.970
"Maybe I can just stop existing,

06:35.972 --> 06:39.765
taking up space in this
treacherous, ill-fitting body.

06:39.767 --> 06:43.354
On the horizon, I want to find
something hopeful."

06:50.695 --> 06:53.031
- That was really good.
- It was amazing.

06:54.491 --> 06:56.284
I thought it was pretty good.

06:58.620 --> 07:01.662
Um...
"On the horizon,

07:01.664 --> 07:04.167
the future looks bleak."

07:05.543 --> 07:07.210
Uh...

07:07.212 --> 07:10.963
Everyone put in their piece of
what their struggle was, and...

07:10.965 --> 07:14.467
<i>all those lines in there
mean something different</i>

07:14.469 --> 07:19.388
<i>to the person who was saying
it and to the rest of us.</i>

07:19.390 --> 07:21.432
"These hands are not."

07:21.434 --> 07:24.519
"These hands have loved
and killed, have caused pain."

07:24.521 --> 07:28.231
"I'm just me, a woman, a daughter,

07:28.233 --> 07:31.275
a writer, a survivor."

07:31.277 --> 07:34.489
"Her once strong son,
now half-hidden and ashamed.

07:35.698 --> 07:38.825
She sees me
and is helpless."

07:38.827 --> 07:42.954
"This land made of eggshells...
fragile but good fertilizer...

07:42.956 --> 07:46.082
"bones, and dying dreams
of free men,

07:46.084 --> 07:49.379
the decay it all grows from
is my land."

07:50.797 --> 07:53.714
- That was really cool.
- It's pretty good.

07:53.716 --> 07:56.175
There's a whole lot there, um...

07:56.177 --> 07:58.553
- a lot on the canvas, you know?
- Mm-hmm.

07:58.555 --> 08:02.598
<i>At the Superbowl we'll fly the F16s
over, and everybody gets a rush.</i>

08:02.600 --> 08:06.018
<i>A service member will be acknowledged,
will stand up, we'll applaud.</i>

08:06.020 --> 08:09.021
<i>And then the game goes on.
That's one side of it.</i>

08:09.023 --> 08:11.190
The other side that needs to be...

08:11.192 --> 08:13.067
placed on a stage

08:13.069 --> 08:14.944
as large, as bright

08:14.946 --> 08:18.990
<i>are the stories of the effect of war</i>

08:18.992 --> 08:22.201
<i>on human beings
who take up the call.</i>

08:22.203 --> 08:25.163
<i>I met some folks from the Pentagon,
asking if there was a way</i>

08:25.165 --> 08:27.623
<i>that I could get
more closely involved.</i>

08:27.625 --> 08:29.917
<i>They introduced me to Seema,</i>

08:29.919 --> 08:33.087
<i>who told me that they had
this idea to put on</i>

08:33.089 --> 08:36.756
<i>a staged reading of works
that they had written.</i>

08:36.759 --> 08:39.469
Seema came in and said
Jeffrey Wright was coming.

08:39.471 --> 08:44.265
And I was, like, "Okay, he know a lot
more stuff than we do in this area."

08:44.267 --> 08:47.977
So, just go from "These hands are
not..." to "First, you should know..."

08:47.979 --> 08:50.938
Everyone together, please okay?

08:50.940 --> 08:52.899
One, two.

08:52.901 --> 08:56.068
- "These hands are not..."
- Great, next.

08:56.070 --> 08:59.280
"First, you should know, there's
no easy way through this."

08:59.282 --> 09:03.034
The ones that are inside the
stanza, just say those once.

09:03.036 --> 09:05.536
"My mother, too, has suffered."

09:05.538 --> 09:07.079
Whatever ideas you have,

09:07.081 --> 09:08.998
whatever thoughts, concerns you have,
please share them,

09:09.000 --> 09:12.335
because you're really the, you know,
the guiding force behind all of this.

09:12.337 --> 09:15.213
In my head, I picture
we're all out there,

09:15.215 --> 09:19.133
and then, a light shines on
whoever is speaking at the time.

09:19.135 --> 09:21.511
We go all over the place,
which was the point, you know?

09:21.513 --> 09:27.141
From cancer, to combat to...
domestic violence, to rape.

09:27.143 --> 09:31.187
Something that has, like, a general
thread of what we kind of want

09:31.189 --> 09:33.898
to encapsulate everything together,
I think would be helpful.

09:33.900 --> 09:35.858
There could be an order

09:35.860 --> 09:39.779
to you guys, um,
entering the stage as soldiers.

09:39.781 --> 09:42.990
- Then that kind of falls away...
- Someone calling cadence?

09:42.992 --> 09:45.954
- We... it could... Uh...
- Let's not push it.

09:48.081 --> 09:51.040
Even if it were
something that were, um...

09:51.042 --> 09:53.209
you know, slightly stylized.

09:53.211 --> 09:55.586
One, two, three.

09:55.588 --> 09:57.090
Slow down.

10:05.849 --> 10:09.058
And then just break out. Okay,
close, that's close, it's close.

10:09.060 --> 10:11.896
- How's that feel to everyone?
- I hate it.

10:13.523 --> 10:15.773
- You hate the lack of structure?
- Yes.

10:15.775 --> 10:17.441
The lack of structure...?

10:17.443 --> 10:20.194
The breaking of formality, and...

10:20.196 --> 10:22.822
Tearing drill apart
into something that informal,

10:22.824 --> 10:25.366
I, uh, it just doesn't...
my brain can't wrap around it.

10:25.368 --> 10:27.827
- Okay.
- But that doesn't mean

10:27.829 --> 10:29.370
it's a bad thing, it just means I...

10:29.372 --> 10:33.291
- My Marine Corps brain, it can't...
- I understand.

10:33.293 --> 10:36.752
Is it when you were marching
in, you just didn't like...

10:36.754 --> 10:40.173
So, you want us to turn left
and you want us to come forward,

10:40.175 --> 10:43.593
and there are
specific commands for that.

10:43.595 --> 10:47.597
Forward march. Ready halt.
Left face.

10:47.599 --> 10:50.892
Forward march. One step, one step.
There are...

10:50.894 --> 10:53.144
But doing it, just kind of like...

10:53.146 --> 10:56.147
We're appropriating it,
but we're not even doing it right.

10:56.149 --> 10:59.108
Or do it color guard style,
then there would just be two people.

10:59.110 --> 11:02.195
Like, for example,
you on our side, and then...

11:02.197 --> 11:05.531
- Yeah. That are quietly calling it.
- ...quietly saying it. Right.

11:05.533 --> 11:10.453
Is there a way you, together, can figure
out how to make that idea work for you?

11:10.455 --> 11:12.538
The freeze step?
Or the one step, and then just...

11:12.540 --> 11:15.625
What what are
you thinking, A.V.?

11:15.627 --> 11:17.460
I like the one step
and then just walking.

11:17.462 --> 11:22.673
Let's try it. Line up over here,
I'll stay right here.

11:22.675 --> 11:27.347
All right, the first thing I want you
guys to do is, uh, take that full step.

11:28.556 --> 11:32.977
Left... left. All right?

11:36.940 --> 11:39.025
Ready, halt.

11:40.401 --> 11:42.068
Left... face.

11:42.070 --> 11:44.280
Oh, sorry, I apologize.
Center face.

11:45.156 --> 11:47.116
One step forward, march.

11:48.493 --> 11:51.077
- All right, then you guys...
- Boom. Yes, thank you.

11:51.079 --> 11:52.956
That's all the structure I need.

11:56.251 --> 11:57.919
- Better?
- That's great, guys.

12:04.759 --> 12:07.426
"I have swallowed so many."

12:07.428 --> 12:10.054
"I have swallowed
so many parts of myself."

12:10.056 --> 12:13.266
"So many glasses of you
that you know my name."

12:13.268 --> 12:18.604
"I have swallowed so many fucking pills,
my blood type is benzo."

12:18.606 --> 12:23.653
"I've touched love, tasted faith
then washed it away with duty.

12:24.654 --> 12:28.823
"I've lost sight of heaven,
found solace in hell.

12:28.825 --> 12:31.576
"In the mirror,
I've murdered the angel

12:31.578 --> 12:33.663
to make room for the devil."

12:37.459 --> 12:39.333
<i>When I was younger,
I always wanted to be</i>

12:39.335 --> 12:41.171
<i>a part of a group of some sort.</i>

12:42.130 --> 12:44.255
<i>Whether it was a bad group
of friends or whatever,</i>

12:44.257 --> 12:46.342
<i>I wanted to be attached
to something,</i>

12:47.260 --> 12:49.929
<i>and the military really
could provide that for me.</i>

12:54.434 --> 12:56.517
<i>I've got eight rotations:</i>

12:56.519 --> 13:00.064
<i>three to Iraq and four to Afghanistan
and one somewhere else.</i>

13:01.149 --> 13:02.525
Bam!

13:03.359 --> 13:07.403
<i>I can't really remember
thinking about my family</i>

13:07.405 --> 13:09.155
while I was gone.

13:09.157 --> 13:14.452
<i>But there was a point when
my ex-wife left, taking my daughter.</i>

13:14.454 --> 13:17.874
<i>And once that happened,
my daughter became my main focus.</i>

13:19.250 --> 13:21.628
<i>I noticed differences in myself.</i>

13:23.421 --> 13:26.464
<i>Up until that point,
I bought into the stigma</i>

13:26.466 --> 13:29.803
<i>of any kind of mental illness
is a weakness.</i>

13:31.179 --> 13:33.179
<i>PTSD was a term that...</i>

13:33.181 --> 13:36.599
I never liked hearing it.
I don't like reading it.

13:36.601 --> 13:39.060
And I see it all over these
medical records and documents

13:39.062 --> 13:40.728
that I've been having
to go through recently,

13:40.730 --> 13:43.858
as, you know, I'm getting close
to transitioning out.

13:46.569 --> 13:49.070
<i>I've gotten myself
into a situation that is...</i>

13:49.072 --> 13:51.324
<i>unbecoming of a soldier.</i>

13:52.784 --> 13:55.451
<i>I was driving back from New York,
dropping my daughter off,</i>

13:55.453 --> 14:00.500
<i>and my ex-fiance had gotten
this prescription for Adderall.</i>

14:01.793 --> 14:04.585
<i>She said, "Hey,
this helps me stay awake."</i>

14:04.587 --> 14:07.549
I didn't know it was gonna cause me
to test positive on a drug test.

14:11.010 --> 14:13.761
<i>Today, I'll be attending
my separation board hearing,</i>

14:13.763 --> 14:17.557
<i>where they're gonna decide whether
to retain me in the military,</i>

14:17.559 --> 14:21.146
<i>so I can do my medical
retirement, or separate me.</i>

14:23.481 --> 14:26.858
<i>I really want to be retained so
I can do the medical retirement.</i>

14:26.860 --> 14:30.822
<i>Or, at least, honorable discharge so
that my daughter can get the G.I. Bill.</i>

14:40.331 --> 14:42.500
See? I told you, courthouse.

14:44.335 --> 14:46.212
Let's get this shit over with.

15:09.235 --> 15:12.780
I want to throw my fist through
this fucking window right now.

15:21.289 --> 15:22.749
Boy, oh, boy.

15:26.252 --> 15:29.420
<i>Their decision was to separate me</i>

15:29.422 --> 15:32.673
<i>for general, other than
honorable, conditions.</i>

15:32.675 --> 15:36.594
<i>So now, I can't get
medical retirement.</i>

15:36.596 --> 15:38.930
What really upsets me is that
they couldn't have the decency

15:38.932 --> 15:41.432
to, at least, give my daughter
the college money.

15:41.434 --> 15:44.018
You know what I mean? Like, you didn't
have to give me the medical treatment.

15:44.020 --> 15:46.105
But my daughter's college money...

15:47.774 --> 15:51.526
So you're telling me that these 12 years
and the stuff that I've gone through

15:51.528 --> 15:54.781
is not worth
my daughter's college fund?

15:57.242 --> 16:01.371
<i>This is not the way I imagined
to be going out of the military.</i>

16:02.997 --> 16:04.872
"This is my new reality,

16:04.874 --> 16:07.585
"spawned from
my irrefutable history.

16:08.711 --> 16:11.504
"I've touched the lives of hundreds.

16:11.506 --> 16:13.631
"Not only those within arm's reach.

16:13.633 --> 16:18.388
I've gone farther, beyond
my scope, with my scope."

16:20.181 --> 16:22.098
I really felt it.

16:22.100 --> 16:27.270
You touched lives with your scope,
and then you take lives with that scope.

16:27.272 --> 16:30.066
- That's real, you know?
- Mm-hmm.

16:31.526 --> 16:35.486
Once, once you commit
to pulling that trigger,

16:35.488 --> 16:38.072
it's the hardest thing in the world.

16:38.074 --> 16:40.366
On the other end of that scope,

16:40.368 --> 16:44.579
there might have been
a good guy, a good kid.

16:44.581 --> 16:47.039
She might have been a good woman.

16:47.041 --> 16:49.417
Most Americans don't realize

16:49.419 --> 16:52.837
that when we have
this theoretical thing

16:52.839 --> 16:55.506
of you go to war, you go and fight

16:55.508 --> 16:59.093
that they're asking people
to go do these things.

16:59.095 --> 17:01.095
We're not gonna talk about
happy la-la-land,

17:01.097 --> 17:02.722
the story of the happy soldier,

17:02.724 --> 17:05.308
like, we're gonna talk to you
about some real shit.

17:05.310 --> 17:07.018
Mm-hmm.

17:07.020 --> 17:09.606
A.V., did you want to do yours?

17:15.361 --> 17:17.904
"I really love
the heruous... heroic..."

17:17.906 --> 17:19.530
Heroic?

17:19.531 --> 17:22.407
"...make-believe,
yet believable,

17:22.410 --> 17:24.993
"nitty-gritty,
dirty, raunchy stories

17:24.996 --> 17:28.998
"of my crew's very own
one-upper guy.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.250
"I love the long, endless drives.

17:31.252 --> 17:34.128
"I love seeing the goats,
the occasional camel.

17:34.130 --> 17:36.132
I love seeing the kids
play in the dirt."

17:44.599 --> 17:46.810
"I love the old bearded man,

17:48.603 --> 17:51.354
"cell phone in the right hand,

17:51.356 --> 17:53.815
"waving hi or good-bye

17:53.817 --> 17:56.859
"with his left hand as he passed by.

17:56.861 --> 17:59.781
"His fucking left hand.

18:00.782 --> 18:02.742
I love this place."

18:03.785 --> 18:06.663
"This poem is not who I am."

18:09.249 --> 18:13.126
Your flow is so good, but when you kind
of struggle with that "heroic" word,

18:13.128 --> 18:16.254
that's something that a lot
of veterans struggle with.

18:16.256 --> 18:18.756
You know when they say,
"Oh, you're a hero," this or that.

18:18.758 --> 18:23.970
So it was really poignant,
honest, and very real.

18:23.972 --> 18:26.139
We have a whole generation of people

18:26.141 --> 18:28.641
whose story
is their shame and guilt.

18:28.643 --> 18:31.853
The whole thing that I see about
your story, or anybody else's,

18:31.855 --> 18:34.105
is the fact that you're still
standing in front of me. That's hope.

18:34.107 --> 18:35.525
Mm.

18:36.401 --> 18:39.360
<i>There are four primary emotions
associated with trauma:</i>

18:39.362 --> 18:42.613
anger, grief, fear, and shame.

18:42.615 --> 18:45.992
Anger, grief, and fear have physical
ways that they leave our bodies,

18:45.994 --> 18:49.203
<i>but shame requires this community</i>

18:49.205 --> 18:53.374
<i>who you show your true self to
and who accepts you anyway.</i>

18:53.376 --> 18:57.714
The army released a news flash,
Military Sexual Trauma on the Rise.

18:58.840 --> 19:01.217
Do they see me now?"

19:03.303 --> 19:06.014
<i>I was a clinical laboratory officer
in the United States Army.</i>

19:07.640 --> 19:12.268
<i>We took care of soldiers and
their family members at the hospital.</i>

19:12.270 --> 19:16.814
That was the highlight of my career,
being able to take care of soldiers.

19:16.816 --> 19:18.818
I honor that, still today.

19:20.111 --> 19:23.446
<i>I am a 100% disabled veteran.</i>

19:23.448 --> 19:28.161
<i>I suffer from PTSD,
bipolar, traumatic brain injury.</i>

19:29.496 --> 19:32.874
<i>My first trauma in the military
was early in my career,</i>

19:33.750 --> 19:38.421
<i>I was inappropriately touched
as I was drawing this guy's blood.</i>

19:39.339 --> 19:43.633
<i>And so, I go and tell one of the
supervisors. And the guy said,</i>

19:43.635 --> 19:46.803
"Do you know this gentleman
has served honorably?

19:46.805 --> 19:50.934
And do you understand the
consequences of what you're saying?"

19:53.728 --> 19:56.646
I saluted him and walked out.

19:56.648 --> 19:59.774
<i>He's telling me that
I'm not valued as a soldier,</i>

19:59.776 --> 20:02.403
<i>and he told me
I wasn't valued as a woman.</i>

20:04.197 --> 20:07.156
I've been raped...

20:07.158 --> 20:10.118
several times
since that initial event.

20:10.120 --> 20:12.038
That's the only time I ever told.

20:13.790 --> 20:15.375
Tell for what?

20:17.710 --> 20:20.962
<i>At that moment, I got really hard.</i>

20:20.964 --> 20:24.173
<i>'Cause if I was gonna survive,
I needed to be hard.</i>

20:24.175 --> 20:28.427
<i>My military duty took
precedence over motherhood.</i>

20:28.429 --> 20:30.763
My children had a drill sergeant.

20:30.765 --> 20:33.975
<i>I made sure that they ate,
made sure that they had shelter,</i>

20:33.977 --> 20:35.768
<i>made sure that they were clothed.</i>

20:35.770 --> 20:37.814
There was no nurturer.

20:38.940 --> 20:40.481
The woman you see today is

20:40.483 --> 20:43.693
a lot different
than the person that I grew up with.

20:43.695 --> 20:46.404
There's a lot of things that
happened that didn't allow my mom

20:46.406 --> 20:50.241
to really be present
as much as she wanted to.

20:50.243 --> 20:53.911
<i>My son say, "You're fightin' for
something that's not fightin' for you.</i>

20:53.913 --> 20:55.955
<i>He said,
"You're willing to die for the military,</i>

20:55.957 --> 20:58.042
<i>and they won't even
help to keep you alive."</i>

20:59.878 --> 21:04.048
<i>That was really the moment where
I started my healing journey.</i>

21:05.258 --> 21:09.010
I remember the first time
that I performed on a stage,

21:09.012 --> 21:11.512
and my children
were in the audience.

21:11.514 --> 21:15.725
<i>I stood up on that stage,
and I put it out there.</i>

21:15.727 --> 21:17.894
And they didn't look down with shame,

21:17.896 --> 21:20.229
they held their heads up
and they were like,

21:20.231 --> 21:23.359
"That's my mom."
And I'm telling you...

21:32.827 --> 21:35.661
<i>These are influenced
by feeling silenced</i>

21:35.663 --> 21:37.455
<i>by the culture of the military,</i>

21:37.457 --> 21:42.629
and the way that stories of
sexual assaults are censored.

21:45.673 --> 21:50.802
I go into the VA, and seven times out of
ten, the person behind the desk is like,

21:50.804 --> 21:53.805
"Well, you know, you have to have
a service-connected disability

21:53.807 --> 21:56.265
to be seen here."

21:56.267 --> 22:01.731
I have a... service-connected
disability at a pretty high percentage.

22:02.816 --> 22:07.735
<i>The primary justification
for my disability is PTSD,</i>

22:07.737 --> 22:10.488
<i>related to a sexual assault.</i>

22:10.490 --> 22:15.118
I am, then, having to, every time
I go to receive medical care,

22:15.120 --> 22:19.122
put on my sexual assaults
as, like, a badge

22:19.124 --> 22:24.838
that is why I belong here, and
how I deserve to get medical care.

22:26.965 --> 22:30.216
<i>I worked in the in-patient
psychiatric unit.</i>

22:30.218 --> 22:36.514
<i>People come there if they are actively
suicidal, homicidal, or psychotic.</i>

22:36.516 --> 22:40.852
My school that I went to
was two and a half months.

22:40.854 --> 22:44.647
<i>You're putting 18-year-old kids with
two and a half months of training</i>

22:44.649 --> 22:46.816
<i>into a situation
where they might have to be</i>

22:46.818 --> 22:49.735
<i>responsible for
ensuring someone's safety.</i>

22:49.737 --> 22:53.614
It's not about, like, changing
people's lives, or healing anyone.

22:53.616 --> 22:56.534
It's about keeping
government-owned commodities

22:56.536 --> 22:58.913
producing until they can't
produce anymore.

23:00.081 --> 23:03.458
<i>And so you have to advocate for
yourself, and that's a really</i>

23:03.460 --> 23:06.627
<i>difficult thing to do,
particularly with sexual assault</i>

23:06.629 --> 23:10.089
<i>because it is something that
eats away at your belief</i>

23:10.091 --> 23:12.341
of your own worthiness.

23:12.343 --> 23:16.139
And the military will absolutely tell
you to suck it up and soldier on.

23:17.765 --> 23:21.392
"Certain kinds of quiet signify
death rather than peace.

23:21.394 --> 23:22.935
"In your search for peace,

23:22.937 --> 23:26.647
try to make sure
you are not sitting quietly in death."

23:26.649 --> 23:32.195
Left, right on left,
right on left, right on left.

23:32.197 --> 23:34.906
"It's been 25 years.

23:34.908 --> 23:37.742
"I joined the Army, I took the oath

23:37.744 --> 23:41.996
to protect and defend the constitution
of the United States of America."

23:41.998 --> 23:45.333
Would it be appropriate if you guys
saluted her when she got there?

23:45.335 --> 23:47.001
As she passes you, you like...

23:47.003 --> 23:49.295
- ...or as she hits the podium.
- That's good.

23:49.297 --> 23:52.967
Right. When she gets to the
podium, everybody's boom, right?

23:59.682 --> 24:01.724
So just, like,
right in here at this paint.

24:01.726 --> 24:04.477
That would be an appropriate spot.

24:04.479 --> 24:08.022
Joe, wait till you hear
that music, right?

24:08.024 --> 24:09.734
Then begin to move.

24:16.074 --> 24:18.616
"This fist is a hammer.

24:18.618 --> 24:21.994
"The fingers as claws trying
to unbend and pull out the nails

24:21.996 --> 24:24.914
"of things you no longer
want to hold together.

24:24.916 --> 24:27.416
"This fist is cumbersome.

24:27.418 --> 24:31.254
"This fist, skin-wrapped bones
so tight, the knuckles flush.

24:31.256 --> 24:33.800
But this fist can be unfolded."

24:36.845 --> 24:40.138
<i>"Remove the aggression,
insert the pen.</i>

24:40.140 --> 24:42.682
<i>"Transplant the ball-peen
with a ballpoint</i>

24:42.684 --> 24:44.725
<i>"until the vice grips of your palms</i>

24:44.727 --> 24:46.394
<i>"transform into feathers.</i>

24:46.396 --> 24:48.604
<i>"Know that this fist can wrap around</i>

24:48.606 --> 24:50.731
<i>"flowers as easily as pistol grips,</i>

24:50.733 --> 24:53.401
<i>"and that sometimes
left-hand flowers,</i>

24:53.403 --> 24:55.905
<i>right-hand pistol grips."</i>

24:58.575 --> 25:01.868
<i>I had a good friend of mine,
from high school,</i>

25:01.870 --> 25:03.955
<i>who was killed in Ramadi.</i>

25:05.373 --> 25:08.040
I watched his mom cry

25:08.042 --> 25:10.960
on the front lawn
for two and a half days.

25:10.962 --> 25:12.879
And I joined the Marine Corps

25:12.881 --> 25:15.508
to try to prevent moms
from layin' in the front yard.

25:17.093 --> 25:19.302
<i>I was in the Marine Corps for 10 years.</i>

25:19.304 --> 25:21.596
<i>I went to Afghanistan.</i>

25:21.598 --> 25:24.056
<i>Supported Iraq.</i>

25:24.058 --> 25:26.769
<i>And was medically retired.</i>

25:28.062 --> 25:29.814
<i>Now, I'm a visual artist.</i>

25:33.610 --> 25:37.403
<i>It's hard to cope and do
normal human being stuff</i>

25:37.405 --> 25:40.241
<i>if you're wearing your
trauma on your sleeve.</i>

25:41.659 --> 25:45.620
<i>When I first got back home from
Afghanistan, my dad was like,</i>

25:45.622 --> 25:48.498
"Hey, if you ever wanna talk,
we're here for you."

25:48.500 --> 25:51.083
But it never made sense to be, like,

25:51.085 --> 25:53.795
"Hey, Dad, I watched
people burn to death.

25:53.797 --> 25:56.130
Also, can you pass
the mashed potatoes?"

25:56.132 --> 25:58.760
Or like, how do I start
this conversation?

26:03.348 --> 26:06.015
<i>When you're walking around,
and all of a sudden,</i>

26:06.017 --> 26:07.975
<i>for reasons you can't explain
at the time,</i>

26:07.977 --> 26:11.103
you feel an emotional response
to something...

26:11.105 --> 26:13.773
whether it's, like,
an alarm goes off,

26:13.775 --> 26:15.858
or the rocks crunch the wrong way,

26:15.860 --> 26:20.365
and it sets something off if your head.
And so...

26:22.867 --> 26:27.997
So now, you're stuck with this
feeling that you can't explain.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.419
What's wrong, buddy?
You okay?

26:36.756 --> 26:39.173
Wanna go sit down, please?

26:39.175 --> 26:40.800
Can you relax?

26:40.802 --> 26:43.511
So, Aidan, what was it like
when you were in Iraq?

26:43.513 --> 26:45.596
Aidan.

26:45.598 --> 26:47.350
Aidan...

26:48.810 --> 26:51.896
Aidan... Aidan.

26:53.106 --> 26:54.689
Hot dogs!

26:54.691 --> 26:57.400
Go around the other way,
so you don't...

26:57.402 --> 27:00.069
<i>After I got back from Afghanistan,</i>

27:00.071 --> 27:03.906
being a single dad,
and dealing with a kid with autism,

27:03.908 --> 27:07.660
and trying to navigate all
these things at the same time,

27:07.662 --> 27:10.665
the depression became so crippling,
that I couldn't get off the couch.

27:12.584 --> 27:15.418
<i>I parked my car in the garage...</i>

27:15.420 --> 27:17.005
<i>and tried to kill myself.</i>

27:18.631 --> 27:20.715
<i>There was a doctor, he was, like,</i>

27:20.717 --> 27:25.470
<i>"You, of all people, deserve
better quality of life."</i>

27:25.472 --> 27:28.639
It was the first time
that somebody, um...

27:28.641 --> 27:31.519
acknowledged the guilt,
is what was...

27:34.522 --> 27:38.318
the biggest injury...
from Afghanistan.

27:47.368 --> 27:50.286
<i>After I'd get home from therapy,</i>

27:50.288 --> 27:53.247
<i>I'd make myself
do something creative</i>

27:53.249 --> 27:56.000
<i>to, like, process that stuff</i>

27:56.002 --> 27:59.003
<i>that I couldn't talk
to anybody else about.</i>

27:59.005 --> 28:02.383
And it became this process
that saved my life.

28:15.814 --> 28:21.192
<i>Being a single parent for so long
is as much a part of this story.</i>

28:21.194 --> 28:24.403
<i>It's not just this linear,
like, "I'm a combat veteran."</i>

28:24.405 --> 28:27.031
<i>It's like, "Yeah, you're
also a human being."</i>

28:27.033 --> 28:30.328
And being a human being is hard.

28:31.579 --> 28:34.914
The idea is, we've broken this for
a minute. We've told this story.

28:34.916 --> 28:36.541
That underneath this...

28:36.543 --> 28:39.794
we're all that we've shown you.

28:39.796 --> 28:44.173
But at the same time, we're service
members, too. And the idea is to...

28:44.175 --> 28:46.344
bring that back into the picture.

28:48.138 --> 28:50.181
Center, face.

28:51.141 --> 28:52.849
Really nice.

28:52.851 --> 28:57.770
What can I not do as far as
whatever proper stage etiquette is?

28:57.772 --> 28:59.814
If there's something
that I feel, um,

28:59.816 --> 29:03.401
is diminishing the power of your
story, then I'll let you know, yeah?

29:03.403 --> 29:05.653
That's the great thing
about the theater.

29:05.655 --> 29:08.072
When you're telling your story,
you tell it the way you want to. Right?

29:08.074 --> 29:09.699
First, you should know.

29:09.701 --> 29:12.326
"First, you should know, there
is no easy way through this."

29:12.328 --> 29:13.788
These hands are not.

29:15.874 --> 29:19.210
- Reach up.
- Well, I'm gonna do the splits.

29:26.718 --> 29:30.430
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha...

29:37.145 --> 29:41.022
The work is so powerful,
and beautiful,

29:41.024 --> 29:43.107
and generous, and...

29:43.109 --> 29:47.653
I'm really just proud to be
with you guys, okay? So...

29:47.655 --> 29:49.157
thank you, see you tomorrow.

29:50.950 --> 29:52.494
Yeah, that's good. Big hug.

30:14.224 --> 30:17.517
Come in to the top, like this.
Go as far as you can.

30:17.519 --> 30:19.936
"These hands were once small.

30:19.938 --> 30:22.230
They are still able to pray."

30:22.232 --> 30:24.857
"Internal bleeding that consumes me

30:24.859 --> 30:27.276
until all I see is red."

30:27.278 --> 30:29.904
"My heart stopped beating.

30:29.906 --> 30:31.950
I no longer felt pain."

30:35.120 --> 30:37.122
"I love this place."

30:50.760 --> 30:53.553
<i>On that stage,
everybody had their own fears</i>

30:53.555 --> 30:55.721
<i>and uncertainties
about the situation.</i>

30:55.723 --> 30:58.349
<i>But the build up for the performance</i>

30:58.351 --> 31:01.521
<i>was not that much different than
how we build up for a mission.</i>

31:08.027 --> 31:10.655
- Hello. Welcome to the theater.
- Thank you.

31:12.782 --> 31:16.284
<i>All the people in the audience
were there because</i>

31:16.286 --> 31:19.579
<i>they wanted to hear
what these stories were.</i>

31:19.581 --> 31:22.540
<i>They wanted to know
what the bigger story was.</i>

31:22.542 --> 31:25.960
<i>Everybody knew they were gonna
be a part of something great.</i>

31:25.962 --> 31:29.883
<i>That we're gonna be heard,
probably for the first time.</i>

31:30.717 --> 31:33.970
<i>'Cause I know that a lot
of us have not been heard.</i>

31:38.475 --> 31:40.143
Group, attention.

31:41.352 --> 31:43.104
Forward, march.

31:49.110 --> 31:51.196
Group, halt.

31:52.197 --> 31:53.990
Center, face.

31:55.992 --> 31:57.619
As you were.

32:07.003 --> 32:08.961
"These hands are not."

32:08.963 --> 32:11.297
"The hands are not clean."

32:11.299 --> 32:13.007
"They are not innocent."

32:13.009 --> 32:14.592
"They are not beholden."

32:14.594 --> 32:16.846
"They are still able to pray."

32:18.181 --> 32:22.809
"This isn't a warrior's song.
This is a sinner's confession...

32:22.811 --> 32:25.939
"a need for forgiveness.

32:27.440 --> 32:29.065
"I've carried emptiness.

32:29.067 --> 32:31.736
"Loved ones lost,
and the loss of ones I've loved.

32:34.489 --> 32:36.366
"Souls I've stolen.

32:38.576 --> 32:41.913
"Their fathers, sons...

32:43.581 --> 32:44.958
"brothers...

32:47.127 --> 32:49.794
mothers and daughters."

32:49.796 --> 32:54.551
Left, right on left,
right on left, right on left!

32:55.927 --> 32:59.720
"60% of military women have
experienced military sexual trauma.

32:59.722 --> 33:03.015
"Are they noticing me?
Do they see me now?

33:03.017 --> 33:05.226
"One night, the phone rang.

33:05.228 --> 33:09.023
"One of the soldiers was arrested
for allegedly raping three females.

33:10.525 --> 33:12.068
"Dear God...

33:15.947 --> 33:20.741
how do I, a rape victim,
keep a rapist safe?"

33:20.743 --> 33:22.910
"I have swallowed so many."

33:22.912 --> 33:26.080
"I have swallowed
so many fucking pills

33:26.082 --> 33:28.040
that my blood type is benzo."

33:28.042 --> 33:32.128
- "And they keep feeding me more.
- I can show you anger."

33:32.130 --> 33:34.130
"Make a fist wrapped in barbed wire,

33:34.132 --> 33:36.674
"but these hands
won't be able to love

33:36.676 --> 33:40.803
"until the barbs are pulled out
to let the skin heal.

33:40.805 --> 33:44.140
And then these palms
hold small fists."

33:44.142 --> 33:48.728
"Resist the urge to lay silently.
Find a loud place.

33:48.730 --> 33:53.441
Maybe one full of children.
Touch something cold, or alive."

33:53.443 --> 33:55.276
"We were never taught."

33:55.278 --> 33:57.487
"That trauma could, and would,

33:57.489 --> 33:59.947
kill our bodies,
ravage our lives."

33:59.949 --> 34:01.491
"They blew up our FOB.

34:01.493 --> 34:04.911
"It was a vehicle-borne IED.
They mortared a small arms fire,

34:04.913 --> 34:09.456
suicide bombers, our FOB was
supposed to be safe as houses."

34:09.458 --> 34:11.375
"Underneath my boots."

34:11.377 --> 34:14.170
"Fields designed
to destroy my body."

34:14.172 --> 34:17.215
"And still, I miss the sand."

34:17.217 --> 34:18.842
"Give me a mission."

34:53.043 --> 34:55.755
"I love seeing that old bearded man.

34:58.842 --> 35:01.845
"I love that he dressed up...

35:04.430 --> 35:07.098
"just for us.

35:07.100 --> 35:11.437
"Rocking his brand-new black,
creased Arabic attire.

35:13.773 --> 35:18.069
And his plaid turban
really makes his outfit pop."

35:28.538 --> 35:30.748
"I love how he smiled.

35:32.208 --> 35:38.045
"Cell phone in his right hand,
waving hi or good-bye

35:38.047 --> 35:41.009
"with his left hand,
as we passed by.

35:43.470 --> 35:45.388
"His fucking left hand.

35:49.476 --> 35:51.853
"In other unimportant news today:

35:53.313 --> 35:57.857
"Two 800-pound IEDs
destroyed three vehicles,

35:57.859 --> 36:00.403
"instantly killing 10 soldiers.

"10 sons, 10 brothers,

"10 family members,
10 battle buddies, 10 friends.

"Tomorrow,

36:14.000 --> 36:16.501
"four more will die.

36:16.503 --> 36:18.795
"The day after,

36:18.797 --> 36:21.132
"one more will die.

36:27.055 --> 36:29.265
I love this place.

36:32.435 --> 36:35.061
"This poem is not
who I am."

36:35.063 --> 36:38.147
"This poem is not
a suicide note."

36:38.149 --> 36:41.234
"This poem is not
a cry for help."

36:41.236 --> 36:43.778
"This poem is not
my broken pieces."

36:43.780 --> 36:46.948
"This poem is love
and all its meanings."

36:46.950 --> 36:49.702
"We are not done yet."

36:57.502 --> 36:59.254
Group, attention.

37:00.964 --> 37:02.674
Rear, march.

38:03.026 --> 38:06.652
<i>If you had met any of these people</i>

38:06.654 --> 38:12.533
<i>before their transition
from being shut in to open,</i>

38:12.535 --> 38:15.663
<i>the transformation is so great now.</i>

38:16.915 --> 38:20.124
It's not about what I've been through,
it's about where I am today.

38:20.126 --> 38:21.918
And I was standing on that stage,

38:21.920 --> 38:24.754
and I was saying that
I've been through all this.

38:24.756 --> 38:26.547
But I'm not done yet.

38:26.549 --> 38:29.926
It might have been the most
beneficial thing that I've...

38:29.928 --> 38:32.637
done out loud...

38:32.639 --> 38:34.472
in my life.

38:34.474 --> 38:36.017
<i>These people...</i>

38:38.311 --> 38:39.687

38:45.360 --> 38:48.655
they are... hope.
