00:03.665 --> 00:05.403
I met your boyfriend the other day.

00:05.442 --> 00:07.331
I made an appointment to see his work.

00:07.409 --> 00:09.144
There was a gorgeous redheaded woman there.

00:09.169 --> 00:10.735
Did you find anything you liked?

00:10.760 --> 00:12.585
No. But it looked like she did.

00:12.617 --> 00:14.532
Previously on "Mistresses"...

00:14.557 --> 00:15.884
Does Dom know you're talking to this guy?

00:15.918 --> 00:17.486
No, I'm working on it.

00:17.520 --> 00:19.387
Please keep this to
ourselves for right now.

00:19.421 --> 00:20.655
What's the occasion?

00:20.690 --> 00:23.091
My girlfriend and I are
gonna try and have a baby.

00:28.831 --> 00:30.298
What do you do?

00:30.332 --> 00:31.937
I'm an escort.

00:32.795 --> 00:33.802
Thank you.

00:35.037 --> 00:36.037
Karen?

00:37.543 --> 00:38.743
Hi.

00:40.008 --> 00:41.102
Hi.

00:42.256 --> 00:43.446
What are you doing here?

00:43.471 --> 00:45.987
I was just gonna ask you that.
Are... are you by yourself?

00:47.103 --> 00:49.850
Oh, yeah, my... friend was
supposed to meet me for dinner,

00:49.885 --> 00:51.756
but she couldn't make it, so...

00:53.142 --> 00:55.896
We should have that dinner
we talked about, catch up.

00:55.921 --> 00:58.191
- What are you doing tomorrow night?
- Tomorrow night?

00:58.226 --> 01:00.027
Uh, unless you'd rather play phone tag

01:00.061 --> 01:01.595
for the next week and a half.

01:02.631 --> 01:05.165
- No, I'm free tomorrow night.
- Great.

01:05.199 --> 01:06.633
Any place you want to go?

01:06.667 --> 01:09.369
You know, I've been out a lot lately.

01:09.404 --> 01:12.205
Why don't you come over,
and I'll cook us dinner?

01:12.240 --> 01:14.941
Really? Since when do you cook?

01:16.377 --> 01:18.678
Ah, it's my brother. I should go.

01:18.712 --> 01:20.780
But I'll see you tomorrow night, okay?

01:23.579 --> 01:25.718
Really glad we ran into each other.

01:25.753 --> 01:28.422
Yeah. Me, too.

01:49.606 --> 01:50.643
Ah...

01:50.678 --> 01:52.478
Oh, come on. Just ignore it.

01:52.512 --> 01:54.547
Mm, I can't ignore it.
It could be a patient.

01:58.277 --> 01:59.526
Wow.

01:59.551 --> 02:01.018
What?

02:01.223 --> 02:02.722
Uh, well, either someone's sending you

02:02.756 --> 02:04.057
a vista of rolling hills

02:04.091 --> 02:05.724
or there are some serious
boobs on your phone.

02:05.758 --> 02:07.859
It's, um... It's a breast enhancement

02:07.894 --> 02:10.205
- that I did a couple days ago.
- Mm. Looks good.

02:12.478 --> 02:14.600
Listen, I know it's strange
that I get texts like this

02:14.634 --> 02:16.034
on my phone, but it's my job.

02:16.069 --> 02:17.203
- Mm-hmm.
- It's my job.

02:17.237 --> 02:19.371
Well, your job is weird and pervy.

02:19.406 --> 02:21.373
No. This is purely clinical.

02:21.408 --> 02:23.542
There's nothing titillating about this.

02:23.577 --> 02:24.776
- Okay...
- No pun intended.

02:24.811 --> 02:26.112
What are you doing? What...

02:26.146 --> 02:27.113
No, it's fine.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.447
No. I'm gonna text her back. Lookit.

02:28.482 --> 02:30.616
Da-da-dun-dun. She's
fine. It's done. Come here.

02:30.650 --> 02:32.951
Come here.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.252
Yeah, no.

02:34.286 --> 02:36.922
Unfortunately, we're gonna
have to take a rain check, doc.

02:36.956 --> 02:38.423
Really? Why?

02:38.457 --> 02:41.426
I don't know... just texts
of swollen post-op breasts

02:41.460 --> 02:42.928
tend to really ruin the mood for me.

02:42.962 --> 02:45.430
- You're kidding.
- Mm-hmm. Mm.

02:45.464 --> 02:47.293
Tired anyway. I'm gonna go to sleep, okay?

02:47.318 --> 02:48.332
Okay.

02:50.569 --> 02:53.204
To be continued.

02:53.239 --> 02:54.906
Mm.

03:05.221 --> 03:07.979
So, what exactly did
this Samantha woman say,

03:08.020 --> 03:10.320
not your interpretation of what she said?

03:10.355 --> 03:13.157
She said there was a hot redheaded woman

03:13.191 --> 03:15.492
at Daniel's place who
was supposedly buying art

03:15.527 --> 03:17.995
and she seemed very comfortable there.

03:18.030 --> 03:20.330
Well, maybe she'd been there before.

03:20.365 --> 03:22.099
Maybe Daniel has a female client

03:22.134 --> 03:23.900
who likes to collect his pieces.

03:23.934 --> 03:25.902
Or maybe he has a female client

03:25.936 --> 03:27.237
who likes to have sex with him...

03:27.272 --> 03:30.433
Which is why she's so damn comfortable.

03:30.458 --> 03:34.134
Maybe. But it all comes down
to whether you trust him or not.

03:34.174 --> 03:36.085
That's the thing. I think a tiny part of me

03:36.110 --> 03:38.245
doesn't completely trust Daniel.

03:38.407 --> 03:40.818
That's probably why I broke into his place.

03:40.843 --> 03:42.243
I didn't find anything, but...

03:42.268 --> 03:44.935
Back up. Back up. Did you
say you broke into his place?

03:44.960 --> 03:46.929
In my defense, the door was unlocked.

03:47.007 --> 03:48.007
When was this?

03:48.659 --> 03:50.808
After you told me you saw
him, you know, when he was

03:50.833 --> 03:53.359
supposed to be in Vermont,
I got panicked he was lying,

03:53.384 --> 03:56.186
so I went to see if he
was there, which he wasn't.

03:56.680 --> 03:59.363
So, if you think about it,
it's your fault I broke in.

03:59.388 --> 04:00.755
Obviously.

04:00.780 --> 04:03.748
But more importantly, this isn't
a hypothetical conversation.

04:03.773 --> 04:05.572
You clearly don't trust this man.

04:05.597 --> 04:07.539
He's got nudes in his studio, Karen,

04:07.564 --> 04:09.865
which means models were
there... nude models.

04:09.890 --> 04:12.400
Plus, he's always ignoring
calls when I'm around

04:12.425 --> 04:14.894
and making "trips to Vermont."

04:14.919 --> 04:17.067
For all I know, "Vermont"
is code for "nude models."

04:17.093 --> 04:18.470
Vermont may not even exist!

04:18.495 --> 04:21.130
Why haven't you just asked
him about this redheaded woman?

04:21.154 --> 04:24.234
Because... I'm afraid.

04:24.298 --> 04:25.432
Of what?

04:25.457 --> 04:27.102
Of what the answer might be.

04:28.460 --> 04:30.428
I mean, right now,
things are going so well,

04:30.462 --> 04:32.327
and I don't want to ruin it by...

04:32.352 --> 04:33.756
By hearing the truth?

04:34.933 --> 04:36.836
Ignorance is bliss, right?

04:37.436 --> 04:39.103
Besides, I don't know for a fact

04:39.138 --> 04:40.971
that he's sleeping with other women.

04:41.006 --> 04:43.307
And you never will unless you ask him.

04:52.151 --> 04:54.418
- Come in.
- Hi.

04:54.453 --> 04:57.075
- Hey.
- What happened to you last night?

04:57.497 --> 04:58.774
What do you mean?

04:59.290 --> 05:01.258
Well, I tried calling you
a whole bunch of times,

05:01.292 --> 05:02.926
but it went straight to voicemail.

05:02.961 --> 05:05.282
Well, my phone must have been turned off.

05:05.964 --> 05:07.145
Oh.

05:07.532 --> 05:11.835
Okay, uh, well, I was
calling to tell you that...

05:11.870 --> 05:13.960
my divorce is final.

05:14.539 --> 05:16.239
All the paperwork is signed.

05:17.853 --> 05:19.943
Where... where were you last night?

05:20.272 --> 05:21.296
What?

05:21.321 --> 05:23.580
Last night. What did you do?

05:25.316 --> 05:28.206
Oh, uh, April came over.

05:28.653 --> 05:32.455
We had some food, and
that was pretty much it.

05:32.490 --> 05:34.850
Nothing too exciting.

05:35.068 --> 05:36.093
Why?

05:36.327 --> 05:37.360
That's all?

05:38.361 --> 05:40.530
Yes. That is all.

05:40.565 --> 05:43.266
What's going on with you?

05:43.301 --> 05:47.489
What's going on is that I
don't like being lied to, Savi.

05:47.802 --> 05:50.189
I saw you on 3rd street last night.

05:50.214 --> 05:52.209
And you weren't with April.
You were with some guy.

05:52.243 --> 05:53.943
And you two looked pretty friendly.

05:53.977 --> 05:56.313
So stop lying to me, Savi.

05:56.347 --> 05:57.547
Okay, let me explain.

05:57.582 --> 06:00.649
No. Don't. Just... Don't,
all right? Not here.

06:00.684 --> 06:02.430
I understand that

06:02.455 --> 06:05.394
- you're upset, but if you...
- Get out of my office.

06:06.499 --> 06:07.600
Now.

06:36.716 --> 06:38.317
- Hey. What's up?
- Hi.

06:38.351 --> 06:39.937
Dom saw me with Zack last night.

06:39.962 --> 06:42.353
We weren't doing anything.
He just saw us on the street.

06:42.378 --> 06:43.818
But then he caught me in a lie this morning

06:43.843 --> 06:45.639
when I told him I was
having dinner with April.

06:45.664 --> 06:46.931
So, I don't know.

06:46.956 --> 06:49.057
This is just bad. I don't
know what to do. What do I do?

06:49.273 --> 06:51.274
Yeah, that's, uh... that's a bummer.

06:51.565 --> 06:53.993
Did you just say, "that's a bummer"?

06:54.127 --> 06:55.093
Uh, yep.

06:55.402 --> 06:57.809
Listen, I can't really be having
this conversation right now.

06:57.834 --> 06:59.668
But for the record, I
told you this might happen.

06:59.693 --> 07:02.183
I know you did, and you were
right. You were definitely right.

07:02.208 --> 07:04.109
But that's not really helpful right now.

07:04.134 --> 07:06.603
Just try to stay calm. We'll
talk about it tonight, okay?

07:06.628 --> 07:07.695
Bye.

07:09.194 --> 07:10.842
Hmm.

07:10.867 --> 07:12.501
- Okay, first of all...
- What?

07:12.526 --> 07:15.160
You're spending way too much on rentals.

07:15.185 --> 07:18.994
- Really?
- Yeah, and second of all...

07:19.315 --> 07:20.483
How's Savi?

07:21.404 --> 07:22.646
Huh?

07:23.098 --> 07:25.399
Oh. Um... She's fine.

07:25.441 --> 07:28.533
Really need to let her know I'm
moving back to Australia at some point.

07:28.558 --> 07:30.791
Yeah, I'd hold off on
that for a little while.

07:30.816 --> 07:34.170
Stuff's just, um, really
stressful at work for her.

07:34.195 --> 07:36.096
You know what? Can we
talk about me for a change?

07:36.121 --> 07:37.354
- "For a change"?
- Yeah.

07:37.379 --> 07:40.227
Um, so, I had a relationship
first with Scott last night.

07:40.252 --> 07:41.419
Okay, no, no, no, no, stop talking

07:41.444 --> 07:43.396
before it's too late
and I can't un-hear it.

07:43.421 --> 07:44.975
No, no, no, it's quite the opposite.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.603
So, I slept over, and we didn't have sex.

07:49.811 --> 07:50.976
Wow.

07:51.001 --> 07:53.269
- Yeah. I know.
- Huh.

07:53.294 --> 07:54.593
Well, good for you.

07:54.949 --> 07:55.951
How is that good for me?

07:55.976 --> 07:57.276
I know this is hard to believe, Joss,

07:57.301 --> 08:00.203
but maybe it means you
are actually maturing.

08:00.228 --> 08:02.796
Or maybe it means the
entire relationship is over.

08:03.468 --> 08:05.945
I rescind the part about maturing.

08:05.970 --> 08:07.925
No, it's not even... I don't...

08:07.972 --> 08:09.939
It's not even about the
no-sex part, Harry. It's...

08:09.974 --> 08:12.809
it's about Scott. I mean, the
guy's a plastic surgeon, right?

08:12.843 --> 08:14.459
He makes boobs all day,

08:14.484 --> 08:16.452
and then he gets text
messages of boobs all night.

08:16.477 --> 08:18.081
It's... it's kind of gross.

08:18.106 --> 08:20.808
Since when do you find boobs
gross? You seemed to quite like

08:20.833 --> 08:23.035
them last year when you were a  lesbian.

08:23.060 --> 08:25.351
Oh, really? Now who's immature here?

08:25.376 --> 08:27.239
I just... I...

08:27.264 --> 08:28.898
I don't know where this can go, Harry.

08:29.059 --> 08:30.730
I just... I think he's kind of weird.

08:30.755 --> 08:33.187
- You're kind of weird.
- Yeah, but I own being weird.

08:33.212 --> 08:34.741
It's... it's my thing, you know?

08:34.765 --> 08:37.034
Meanwhile, he pretends to be
this straight-laced doctor,

08:37.058 --> 08:38.705
and he's got a closet full of lady shoes,

08:38.730 --> 08:40.756
and you don't even get to
choose which ones you wear.

08:40.780 --> 08:43.616
Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I'm gonna
pretend I didn't hear that bit.

08:43.807 --> 08:48.611
Look  Joss, you seem to
be generally happy lately,

08:48.645 --> 08:50.479
which might have something
to do with this guy.

08:50.505 --> 08:52.872
I wouldn't do anything
drastic if I were you.

08:52.992 --> 08:54.180
Okay.

08:54.205 --> 08:56.506
Do you see this? This, uh...

08:56.531 --> 08:58.047
this is why you can't go back to Australia.

08:58.072 --> 08:59.641
I need this Harry wisdom in my life.

08:59.666 --> 09:01.794
Yeah. Nice try. Still going.

09:10.099 --> 09:11.697
Hey, you. Come on in.

09:13.864 --> 09:16.200
This is a nice surprise.

09:16.225 --> 09:17.525
Yeah, I closed the store early,

09:17.550 --> 09:20.534
and I thought I would
just come by and say hi.

09:21.824 --> 09:22.957
Hi.

09:33.395 --> 09:35.429
I have to ask you something.

09:35.560 --> 09:37.094
Sure. Go ahead.

09:37.292 --> 09:39.545
This may seem like it's
coming out of nowhere.

09:41.230 --> 09:44.677
I wanted to know if you...

09:48.694 --> 09:51.313
wanted to take me to Vermont this weekend.

09:51.439 --> 09:53.674
Uh, Karen offered to watch Lucy,

09:53.708 --> 09:55.790
and I can use a break from the store.

09:56.085 --> 09:59.470
We can have a nice romantic
getaway, just the two of us.

10:01.649 --> 10:03.410
You know what? Forget it. Never mind.

10:03.435 --> 10:05.613
- Forget I even asked.
- No, no! No. Hey, hey. Hey.

10:05.638 --> 10:09.241
That sounds amazing, okay? I
would love to take you, okay?

10:10.594 --> 10:13.563
Let's go book some flights, okay?

10:24.842 --> 10:27.310
Smells amazing, Karen.

10:27.335 --> 10:29.637
I took a cooking class a few months ago.

10:29.662 --> 10:31.587
I'm really good at making three dishes.

10:32.643 --> 10:35.244
- So, how is your practice going?
- The practice?

10:35.269 --> 10:38.477
Uh, good. The new office mate, not so good.

10:38.751 --> 10:39.919
Oh, no. Why not?

10:39.953 --> 10:42.223
Uh, I don't want to go into specifics.

10:42.248 --> 10:43.745
Let's just say, uh...

10:43.949 --> 10:47.185
Cleanliness is not Dr.
Rogers' top priority.

10:49.651 --> 10:51.519
I miss having you next door.

10:51.544 --> 10:53.340
And not just because you shower.

10:55.311 --> 10:58.446
So, um...

10:58.769 --> 11:00.236
You seeing anyone these days?

11:00.606 --> 11:02.015
Um...

11:02.146 --> 11:04.948
Just a few dates here and
there. Nothing serious.

11:04.973 --> 11:07.226
Ah. Aha. I see.

11:07.251 --> 11:08.384
What about you?

11:09.190 --> 11:12.005
Uh, not really. No. Well, I've...

11:12.030 --> 11:14.762
I've been seeing someone for a few weeks,

11:14.787 --> 11:16.433
but I don't think it's gonna last.

11:16.458 --> 11:19.251
- Why not?
- She's... she's a little young for me.

11:19.276 --> 11:21.227
Not much of a future in it.

11:21.486 --> 11:23.554
You know... The usual.

11:30.326 --> 11:32.294
A dozen croissant rolls coming up.

11:32.319 --> 11:34.687
All right. Bring 'em on.

11:45.017 --> 11:47.627
Hi. Can we please talk?

11:47.811 --> 11:50.113
Look, I know how this must look to you,

11:50.460 --> 11:54.062
but I promise you it's not what you think.

11:54.087 --> 11:56.324
Okay. How do you know what I think?

11:56.349 --> 11:58.222
Because I know what I would think.

11:58.739 --> 12:00.373
Zack and I are just friends, okay?

12:00.398 --> 12:03.783
There is absolutely
nothing going on between us.

12:03.808 --> 12:06.921
Okay, so, uh, you have
a new friend named Zack

12:06.946 --> 12:08.513
who you didn't tell me about,

12:08.538 --> 12:10.494
but I'm not supposed to
think anything is strange?

12:10.519 --> 12:12.294
- No, it's strange. It's just...
- And where exactly

12:12.319 --> 12:14.220
are you meeting all these new guy friends?

12:14.245 --> 12:16.313
I'm sorry. I'm not
quite following the story.

12:16.748 --> 12:19.016
I didn't "meet" him.

12:19.041 --> 12:20.988
He found me.

12:21.013 --> 12:24.267
Dom, he's the guy that
was in the other car...

12:25.826 --> 12:26.859
From the accident.

12:26.884 --> 12:29.426
The accident? What, your accident?

12:29.451 --> 12:31.244
He came to the open house a few weeks ago

12:31.269 --> 12:34.349
and explained who he was,
so I invited him in and...

12:34.374 --> 12:36.525
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold
up. Hold u... okay.

12:36.550 --> 12:39.185
I'm... I'm... I'm just trying
to fully understand this.

12:39.406 --> 12:41.753
So, a guy that you got
into a car crash with

12:41.778 --> 12:44.534
shows up at your front door...
a guy who, for all you know,

12:44.559 --> 12:46.885
could hate you, could
blame you for the accident,

12:46.910 --> 12:49.129
could be crazy... and you let him in?

12:49.154 --> 12:51.289
He's just... he's in a bad way, okay?

12:51.314 --> 12:53.215
The accident really screwed up his life.

12:53.240 --> 12:54.873
So, is he hitting you up for money yet?

12:54.898 --> 12:57.199
Is he planning on suing
you bec... for the accident?

12:57.224 --> 13:00.427
This is insane, Savi. You're a
lawyer. You should know better.

13:00.452 --> 13:02.401
I'm not naive, Dom, okay?

13:02.426 --> 13:05.195
I didn't trust him at first, either, but...

13:05.595 --> 13:07.932
I don't know... The more I got to know him,

13:07.957 --> 13:11.926
I realized he really is
not here for anything.

13:12.435 --> 13:14.369
Okay. Okay, then.

13:14.403 --> 13:17.507
Well, uh, if you know him so well,

13:18.115 --> 13:20.917
maybe we should go out... all of us.

13:21.578 --> 13:23.628
What do you mean, "go out"?

13:23.653 --> 13:25.650
Well, if you trust him and like him so much

13:25.675 --> 13:29.444
and he's your friend, maybe
we should all be friends.

13:29.952 --> 13:31.049
Oh.

13:32.182 --> 13:33.449
Okay.

13:34.464 --> 13:36.398
Yeah. I'll ask him.

13:36.423 --> 13:38.228
Great. Great. Then we can, uh...

13:38.253 --> 13:39.953
We can all have lunch tomorrow then.

13:41.597 --> 13:43.279
Can't wait.

13:56.815 --> 13:58.488
Babe, how much salt did you put in there?

13:58.513 --> 13:59.983
- Enough to make it taste good.
- Yeah?

14:00.008 --> 14:01.208
Because I can actually feel my heart rate

14:01.233 --> 14:03.297
spiking to unhealthy levels as we speak.

14:03.322 --> 14:04.353
Mm.

14:05.760 --> 14:07.728
What's the matter with you?
You're so quiet tonight.

14:07.753 --> 14:08.856
Dr. Scott?

14:08.881 --> 14:10.640
Hi! It is you!

14:10.665 --> 14:11.832
- Hey.
- Hello!

14:11.857 --> 14:13.824
Oh! Hey.

14:13.997 --> 14:15.798
Uh, this is my girlfriend, Joss.

14:15.823 --> 14:17.924
Joss, this is, uh, Autumn.
She's a patient of mine.

14:17.949 --> 14:20.143
Ah! Hmm. Oh, I can... I can see that.

14:20.168 --> 14:24.357
I know. Aren't they amazing?
Your boyfriend is a genius.

14:24.382 --> 14:26.144
Well, it's...

14:26.169 --> 14:27.703
So, what do you think? How do they look?

14:27.728 --> 14:30.022
This is the first time I've taken
them out since the bandages came off.

14:30.047 --> 14:32.763
- They look good.
- I'm just not sure if we should have gone

14:32.788 --> 14:35.570
a little bit bigger, and
I think that the left one

14:35.595 --> 14:37.562
is a little smaller than the right one.

14:37.816 --> 14:39.737
Actually, would you mind feeling it

14:39.762 --> 14:40.877
and letting me know what you think?

14:40.902 --> 14:44.839
Oh. Um, see, the thing, I c...
my hands... my hands are salty.

14:44.864 --> 14:45.931
- Oh.
- Yeah.

14:45.956 --> 14:47.858
Um, but if you call the office, we can...

14:47.883 --> 14:50.866
we can make an appointment
and get you all set.

14:50.891 --> 14:52.358
All right. I'll see you soon.

14:52.383 --> 14:54.024
Nice to meet you.

14:55.011 --> 14:56.588
I am so sorry about that.

14:56.613 --> 14:59.081
Oh, no, no. You can't help
it that you're a genius.

15:00.604 --> 15:02.239
... Comes a new definition of "terror."

15:02.264 --> 15:05.233
I am really loving your new place.

15:05.258 --> 15:06.792
How... how long have you been here now?

15:07.019 --> 15:08.469
About a year.

15:08.494 --> 15:11.476
You know, I actually, um...

15:11.587 --> 15:14.549
Stopped by to see you
a couple times, but...

15:15.062 --> 15:17.306
I chickened out and didn't buzz.

15:17.331 --> 15:18.483
You did? Why not?

15:18.508 --> 15:19.975
I was a little nervous.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.860
I mean, you can be kind
of intimidating, Karen.

15:22.885 --> 15:25.046
Intimidating?

15:26.110 --> 15:29.218
Yes, I can be very scary. I know.

15:32.498 --> 15:34.498
So, why were you coming to see me?

15:34.744 --> 15:36.198
Um...

15:36.223 --> 15:39.450
Because I wasn't completely honest with you

15:39.475 --> 15:41.010
the last time I saw you.

15:43.271 --> 15:47.733
I said I didn't have
any feelings left for you, and...

15:48.785 --> 15:49.950
I did.

15:52.075 --> 15:53.242
I do.

15:54.148 --> 15:56.950
You said no when I asked you out.

15:57.551 --> 15:59.782
I didn't know if I was
ready to go down that road.

15:59.807 --> 16:00.992
But... but...

16:03.159 --> 16:05.384
- Do you believe in signs?
- Not really.

16:05.409 --> 16:08.545
Neither do I, but running
into you at that valet stand,

16:08.570 --> 16:10.605
I mean, that... That kind of felt like one.

16:12.310 --> 16:14.517
It kind of did.

16:33.808 --> 16:34.824
What's wrong?

16:34.849 --> 16:37.175
Nothing. Nothing.
Everything is... is great.

16:37.200 --> 16:38.833
This doesn't seem great.

16:38.858 --> 16:41.651
I know. I'm sorry, Karen.
I just... if we're...

16:41.676 --> 16:45.146
if we're really gonna
do this, I just feel like

16:45.171 --> 16:48.107
I need to take care of my
other dating situation first.

16:48.749 --> 16:50.115
Oh, okay.

16:50.140 --> 16:53.745
Um, uh... Thank you for...
for dinner. It was excellent.

16:53.770 --> 16:56.406
Um, I will call you soon, okay? I...

16:56.431 --> 16:57.831
uh, very soon.

17:05.825 --> 17:07.960
Zack, hey.

17:08.258 --> 17:09.224
- Hey.
- Hi.

17:09.250 --> 17:10.717
I didn't know whether you liked lemonade

17:10.742 --> 17:12.541
or iced tea, so I got Arnold Palmers.

17:12.925 --> 17:14.060
Thank you.

17:14.339 --> 17:15.972
Uh, Zack.

17:16.243 --> 17:17.782
Uh, Dominic.

17:21.213 --> 17:25.422
Uh, so, Zack, I thought that
you guys should meet in person

17:25.446 --> 17:28.182
so Dom could see in your eyes
that there's no ulterior motives

17:28.207 --> 17:31.919
and no, you know, big, secret plot.

17:32.305 --> 17:33.772
No, I get it.

17:33.883 --> 17:38.912
I just wanted to meet Savi
and found an unlikely friend.

17:39.067 --> 17:40.573
That's all, man.

17:40.598 --> 17:46.003
Okay. Well, um, so tell me something, man.

17:46.280 --> 17:47.753
Um...

17:47.778 --> 17:50.745
What would you think if you
were sitting where I am...

17:50.923 --> 17:54.792
your girlfriend starts hanging
out with some strange guy?

17:55.069 --> 17:56.539
That wouldn't bother you?

17:57.178 --> 18:01.248
I don't know, but I just told
you nothing's going on, so...

18:01.570 --> 18:04.800
Maybe we should order some
food or something harder.

18:04.825 --> 18:06.769
So, what made you decide to stalk Savi

18:06.794 --> 18:07.995
and go to her open house?

18:08.020 --> 18:11.022
Stalk? Uh, do I need to hire a lawyer here?

18:11.047 --> 18:14.016
'Cause it kind of feels like
I'm being cross-examined here.

18:14.041 --> 18:15.408
I'm just making

18:15.433 --> 18:18.135
friendly conversation,
you know, between friends.

18:18.160 --> 18:21.910
Look, I was just curious about Savi.

18:22.069 --> 18:24.871
I wanted to see how she was doing.

18:25.078 --> 18:26.845
I knew that she was the one person

18:26.870 --> 18:29.205
that could understand
what I was going through.

18:29.230 --> 18:31.451
- With the accident.
-Yeah, I get it, Savi.

18:31.476 --> 18:34.318
Hey. No, no. Don't talk to her like that.

18:36.658 --> 18:40.190
All right, look.

18:40.707 --> 18:43.910
Savi might not see what's
going on here, but I do.

18:43.935 --> 18:46.112
You're a guy. You're not
looking to make a new friend.

18:46.137 --> 18:47.920
You either want money, or you want Savi.

18:47.945 --> 18:49.513
Okay. You know what, Dom? That's enough.

18:49.538 --> 18:51.872
I don't see him denying anything.

18:53.840 --> 18:56.475
When we first starting hanging
out, we were just friends.

18:56.500 --> 18:58.335
- "Were."
- We are just friends.

18:58.360 --> 19:01.464
- Yeah, but you want more.
- I don't know. Maybe.

19:03.407 --> 19:05.041
The more time we spend together,

19:05.066 --> 19:06.719
the more I realize that
we have a connection.

19:06.744 --> 19:08.545
I don't know if you
felt it. Maybe you...

19:08.857 --> 19:10.442
maybe... maybe you haven't.

19:10.467 --> 19:12.879
No, no, no. Dom, I'm...
I had no idea of this, okay?

19:12.904 --> 19:14.871
You know what? I don't really
care who knew what when.

19:14.896 --> 19:16.563
All right? I'm out of here.

19:21.278 --> 19:23.679
I didn't mean it to go like that.

19:23.704 --> 19:27.374
- Don't.
- I'm sorry, all right? I didn't plan...

19:32.141 --> 19:33.164
It's fantastic.

19:33.189 --> 19:35.190
Really? You're not just saying that.

19:35.215 --> 19:37.454
No, it'll look perfect
in your storefront window.

19:37.479 --> 19:40.065
What? No, I've never
put something I've made

19:40.090 --> 19:41.265
in my front window.

19:41.290 --> 19:43.072
I don't see why you
wouldn't. This piece is better

19:43.097 --> 19:45.064
than anything else you got in the store.

19:47.433 --> 19:49.567
This is all because of you, you know?

19:49.592 --> 19:52.661
I wasn't working on anything
until you came into my life.

19:52.686 --> 19:54.387
You've really inspired me.

19:54.518 --> 19:57.694
Aww. You've done the same for me.

20:00.017 --> 20:03.086
Mm. Well, maybe we could
have a show together.

20:03.111 --> 20:05.079
Mm?

20:06.288 --> 20:08.396
I forgot. Uh, bad news.

20:08.421 --> 20:09.854
We can't go to Vermont this weekend.

20:12.167 --> 20:13.289
Why?

20:13.482 --> 20:16.763
Uh, termite infestation, so we had to tent.

20:17.047 --> 20:19.181
But I did book us a trip
to Big Bear, you know,

20:19.206 --> 20:20.717
so we can still go away.

20:27.765 --> 20:28.899
What is it?

20:29.542 --> 20:31.176
You're lying.

20:32.273 --> 20:33.450
I know you're lying.

20:33.475 --> 20:34.619
What?

20:34.644 --> 20:35.877
My friend saw you out

20:35.902 --> 20:38.218
when you were supposed to be
in Vermont a few weeks ago.

20:38.310 --> 20:40.053
Please don't lie to me again,

20:40.078 --> 20:42.246
because I just may lose
it on you right here.

20:42.271 --> 20:43.721
Okay. Okay.

20:44.630 --> 20:46.498
Truth is...

20:48.245 --> 20:52.081
I don't have a house in
Vermont, okay? Not anymore.

20:52.726 --> 20:55.561
The story I told you, it...
it was true, about my mom,

20:55.586 --> 20:57.003
but I sold it a few years ago.

20:57.028 --> 20:58.802
I don't care about the damn house!

20:58.827 --> 21:00.327
I want to know where you go

21:00.352 --> 21:02.319
when you keep telling me you're there!

21:03.520 --> 21:06.640
My friend saw a redheaded woman
at your place the other day.

21:06.834 --> 21:08.467
Are you sleeping with her?

21:08.948 --> 21:11.783
Just tell me the truth! Just
be honest with me, Daniel!

21:11.808 --> 21:13.676
Are there other women?

21:16.690 --> 21:18.209
Just that one.

21:19.471 --> 21:20.877
She's...

21:22.071 --> 21:23.470
My wife.

21:36.355 --> 21:38.567
He just stopped mid-kiss
out of respect for you?

21:38.592 --> 21:41.871
For me or for the girl, who is
apparently much younger than me,

21:41.896 --> 21:43.478
which is why I'm calling her "a girl."

21:43.503 --> 21:45.151
Oh, no, no, honey. It
was definitely for you.

21:45.176 --> 21:47.374
You guys are perfect for each
other. You're both shrinks.

21:47.399 --> 21:49.500
You're gorge, and he's
tall, dark, and chinny.

21:49.525 --> 21:51.659
Men generally don't dump
young women for older women.

21:51.684 --> 21:53.819
They dump young women for younger women.

21:53.844 --> 21:55.752
- I really don't like younger women.
- Me, neither,

21:55.777 --> 21:58.293
specifically ones who ask
your boyfriend to feel them up

21:58.318 --> 22:00.618
in the movie theater. It's a long story.

22:00.643 --> 22:02.181
Actually, that's the whole story.

22:02.206 --> 22:03.730
Ring, damn it.

22:03.785 --> 22:06.159
Karen, stop! Okay. Stop. He's gonna call.

22:06.184 --> 22:08.727
Sometimes, it just takes a
couple days to dump somebody.

22:09.109 --> 22:11.745
- Unless it's not about her.
- Hmm?

22:11.770 --> 22:13.310
Maybe when he kissed me,

22:13.335 --> 22:14.701
everything that happened last year

22:14.726 --> 22:16.027
just came flooding back to him.

22:16.052 --> 22:17.286
Now you're just being paranoid.

22:17.311 --> 22:19.178
This wasn't some date with
a guy that googled you.

22:19.203 --> 22:21.504
This was Jacob. Uh, he's your friend.

22:21.529 --> 22:23.297
He knew exactly what he was getting into

22:23.322 --> 22:25.823
when he asked you out. Just
give the guy some credit, okay?

22:25.848 --> 22:26.982
See?

22:27.341 --> 22:29.010
It's April.

22:29.240 --> 22:30.705
Yeah.

22:30.730 --> 22:32.532
- Oh.
- Oh. Uh-oh.

22:34.647 --> 22:36.948
How can this happen again?

22:36.982 --> 22:38.825
I mean, is it me?

22:38.850 --> 22:40.684
Do I only attract dishonest men?

22:41.451 --> 22:42.985
I'm such an idiot.

22:43.010 --> 22:44.643
No, you are not an idiot.

22:44.668 --> 22:47.638
You've just... you've just
had bad luck with two guys.

22:47.663 --> 22:49.256
Yeah, two out of three.

22:49.429 --> 22:51.608
So, how did you two leave it?

22:51.633 --> 22:53.267
How do you think she left it, right?

22:53.292 --> 22:55.001
I mean, he's married.

22:56.716 --> 22:59.471
I told him to go, and
he did. And that was it.

22:59.496 --> 23:00.950
You didn't even hear his side of the story?

23:00.975 --> 23:03.943
What side? There is no side.

23:04.343 --> 23:06.971
Plus, I knew that if he started talking,

23:06.996 --> 23:08.809
I would let him convince me.

23:10.415 --> 23:14.195
Oh, sweetie, you did the right thing.

23:14.220 --> 23:16.255
I know it must have been really hard,

23:16.280 --> 23:18.014
but you did do the right thing.

23:18.039 --> 23:20.650
I just feel bad... for both of you.

23:20.675 --> 23:22.942
- Why do you feel bad for him?
- Yeah. Why?

23:22.967 --> 23:25.202
Because I saw the way he looked at you.

23:25.696 --> 23:29.332
Even if he is married, I could
see he really cared about you.

23:29.367 --> 23:31.482
And I know you cared about him, too.

23:33.279 --> 23:35.319
I think I really loved him.

23:35.344 --> 23:37.960
Well  maybe...

23:37.985 --> 23:40.287
maybe you guys can figure
something out, you know?

23:40.312 --> 23:42.779
How? He's married.

23:42.804 --> 23:44.938
Well, I know. You were married.

23:45.353 --> 23:48.123
And now you're not,
you know? Things happen.

23:48.148 --> 23:49.526
I think it's silly for any of us

23:49.551 --> 23:51.809
to get all moral-high-groundy,
considering our track records.

23:51.834 --> 23:55.326
No, no, I'm not talking about us.

23:55.351 --> 23:57.052
I'm talking about April.

23:57.991 --> 24:00.070
She's a saint.

24:00.278 --> 24:02.997
Even saints are allowed to feel sad.

24:28.631 --> 24:32.062
I tried calling a few
times, but you didn't answer.

24:32.087 --> 24:33.721
Zack, what are you doing here?

24:33.930 --> 24:36.732
You can't just show up whenever
you want to, especially now.

24:36.757 --> 24:39.992
I just needed to talk to
you. I wanted to apologize.

24:40.017 --> 24:42.285
Yeah, how could you do that to me?

24:42.310 --> 24:45.369
You knew why I wanted
you to meet Dom, okay?

24:45.394 --> 24:47.196
I just... I...

24:47.243 --> 24:48.963
I don't understand what happened.

24:48.988 --> 24:52.956
Neither do I, but
everything I said was true.

24:52.977 --> 24:54.696
You put me in a terrible position.

24:54.722 --> 24:56.479
And I feel bad about that.

24:58.094 --> 25:03.129
But I'm not going to pretend
that this was all in my head.

25:04.194 --> 25:07.304
It wasn't just me in
this relationship, Savi.

25:07.512 --> 25:10.440
We are not in a relationship, Zack.

25:13.586 --> 25:16.103
And I'm sorry if I gave
you the wrong idea. I...

25:16.137 --> 25:18.288
Why didn't you tell Dom about me?

25:19.140 --> 25:21.608
Okay, there's no point in discussing this.

25:21.642 --> 25:25.112
I have to concentrate on
my relationship with Dom.

25:25.946 --> 25:27.356
I'm sorry.

25:44.765 --> 25:47.400
Hey.

25:47.434 --> 25:49.569
You do realize that
you're hours late, right?

25:49.594 --> 25:51.194
"Hours" with an "s"... plural.

25:52.499 --> 25:54.930
- I know.
- Well, okay.

25:54.955 --> 25:56.808
I told Michelle and Ben
to just go ahead and eat

25:56.833 --> 25:58.200
so they wouldn't lose the table, but

25:58.225 --> 26:00.089
I'm sure they're probably
home by now, anyway, so...

26:00.114 --> 26:02.402
Joss, I'm sorry. You want
me to take you somewhere else?

26:02.427 --> 26:06.732
No. No, I've... I already had a box of
chips ahoy and started "The Bachelorette."

26:06.757 --> 26:08.122
I don't think I could
take much more excitement.

26:08.467 --> 26:09.767
We'll just do it another night.

26:11.738 --> 26:13.731
You know what? Just...

26:14.294 --> 26:16.095
Why exactly couldn't you call me?

26:16.120 --> 26:17.587
Don't use the doctor excuse,

26:17.612 --> 26:19.479
because I've seen medical dramas, and...

26:19.504 --> 26:21.242
McSqueamy or whoever is always

26:21.267 --> 26:23.201
stepping out of the O.R.
to call somebody, so...

26:23.236 --> 26:24.971
You don't think you're overreacting
maybe just a little bit?

26:24.996 --> 26:26.537
No, I just... I don't understand, Scott.

26:26.562 --> 26:28.440
It's not like you perform
open-heart surgery.

26:28.474 --> 26:31.439
What was so important that
you couldn't take two seconds

26:31.502 --> 26:32.846
- and just call me?
- You really want to know?

26:32.871 --> 26:34.137
- Yeah, Scott!
- Yeah?

26:34.163 --> 26:35.849
Okay, no, you're right. I
wasn't doing open-heart surgery.

26:35.874 --> 26:38.926
I'm not a heart surgeon. I was
doing a regular old rhinoplasty.

26:38.951 --> 26:40.777
Something I've probably
done 1,000 times in my life,

26:40.811 --> 26:42.679
and everything was going perfectly fine

26:42.713 --> 26:45.093
until she didn't wake
up from her anaesthesia.

26:46.280 --> 26:47.865
So, she died right there in recovery.

26:47.890 --> 26:50.227
- She's 22 years old, and she's dead.
- What?

26:50.678 --> 26:53.483
- Oh, my God. Scott, I'm s...
- Yeah, so now I'm on the phone, right?

26:53.508 --> 26:55.309
I've got to call her parents,
right? I got to explain to them

26:55.334 --> 26:57.473
why their daughter died getting a nose job.

26:58.116 --> 26:59.750
I got to try to make sense
out of something that doesn't

26:59.775 --> 27:01.743
make any sense at all, so
I am so sorry that I'm late.

27:01.768 --> 27:04.403
And I'm sorry that I don't
feel like eating sushi tonight

27:04.428 --> 27:06.395
with our friends, honey, but
I had a really crappy day,

27:06.420 --> 27:07.720
and this... this isn't helping.

27:47.099 --> 27:48.919
One minute. That's all you get.

27:50.269 --> 27:51.403
Thank you.

27:51.437 --> 27:52.982
Don't thank me.

27:53.288 --> 27:55.107
I don't even know why you're here.

27:56.441 --> 27:57.741
I'm here to apologize.

27:57.775 --> 28:00.213
For being married? Apology not accepted.

28:00.238 --> 28:02.041
No, for not being honest.

28:03.148 --> 28:06.483
But in my defense, I never
expected any of this to happen.

28:06.518 --> 28:07.984
It wasn't ever a part of the plan.

28:08.019 --> 28:10.487
What was the plan? You were
gonna just sleep with me

28:10.522 --> 28:12.873
until you got bored,
and that would be that?

28:12.898 --> 28:15.093
No, no. Okay, of course not, okay?

28:15.160 --> 28:18.128
It's just... Uh, what happened with us,

28:18.163 --> 28:19.902
It's not something that I do.

28:19.931 --> 28:22.131
Okay? It's not something that
I've... I've ever done, and...

28:22.166 --> 28:24.434
and... and... and I've...
I've been tortured about it.

28:24.468 --> 28:27.303
Oh, now I'm supposed to feel bad for you.

28:27.337 --> 28:28.417
No.

28:29.655 --> 28:30.964
I just...

28:31.508 --> 28:34.831
I want you to understand that it was real.

28:37.214 --> 28:38.938
Okay? What we had...

28:40.051 --> 28:41.184
It was real.

28:47.062 --> 28:49.302
I think I may always love you.

28:49.327 --> 28:53.487
I'll never deserve you, and
you may never forgive me.

28:55.201 --> 28:57.618
But I had to tell you.

29:00.041 --> 29:01.842
'Cause I'm so sorry, April.

29:06.090 --> 29:07.257
I know you are.

29:11.767 --> 29:14.736
but I think your minute is up.

29:34.252 --> 29:44.061
_

29:44.243 --> 29:45.710
Okay, all right.

29:45.735 --> 29:47.885
So, you made an ass of yourself.

29:47.910 --> 29:50.545
What happened when he
came back into the room?

29:50.570 --> 29:53.372
- I'm not sure.
- You left?

29:53.397 --> 29:55.030
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

29:55.210 --> 29:57.756
- Yeah.
- What were you thinking?

29:57.781 --> 29:59.182
I don't know, Harry. I was thinking

29:59.207 --> 30:01.375
I just wanted to escape before
he came out of the bathroom

30:01.400 --> 30:04.034
- and told me what a bitch I was.
- Right. Yeah.

30:04.059 --> 30:05.625
As logical as that is,

30:05.650 --> 30:08.918
did you ever consider
any other possibilities?

30:08.943 --> 30:10.144
Like what?

30:10.169 --> 30:11.636
Oh, geez, I don't know...
off the top of my head,

30:11.661 --> 30:14.763
how about not leaving and
having an adult conversation?

30:15.148 --> 30:16.983
Yeah, no. Not so much.

30:17.008 --> 30:18.824
Not for a second.

30:18.849 --> 30:20.693
Harry, can you please
stop signing those papers?

30:20.718 --> 30:22.352
We're in the middle of
a crisis here. Come on.

30:22.377 --> 30:24.057
I don't understand what's
going on with you lately.

30:24.082 --> 30:25.349
The other day, you kept babbling on

30:25.374 --> 30:26.940
about how you weren't
sure if you were right

30:26.965 --> 30:28.232
for each other, and now you're in a crisis

30:28.257 --> 30:30.791
because you had a fight.
You're all over the place.

30:30.816 --> 30:32.683
What? What... I'm babbling? Really?

30:32.708 --> 30:35.824
You're acting very odd when it
comes to this guy, even for you.

30:35.849 --> 30:37.149
Really? You think that I'm acting odd?

30:37.174 --> 30:38.808
Harry, you don't think that
it's odd that these women

30:38.833 --> 30:40.970
text him photos of their breasts
and ask him to feel them up

30:40.995 --> 30:43.027
and, clearly, all of his
patients are in love with him?

30:43.052 --> 30:44.312
It pisses me off!

30:44.337 --> 30:46.675
- Aha!
- What?

30:46.700 --> 30:49.785
Elementary, my dear Joss. You...

30:50.602 --> 30:51.769
are jealous.

30:51.794 --> 30:54.280
Oh, puh-lease. Harry, I don't get jealous.

30:54.305 --> 30:55.977
- Well, clearly, you don't like

30:56.002 --> 30:57.302
having to fight for Scott's attention.

30:57.406 --> 30:58.873
That is jealousy.

30:59.445 --> 31:02.247
I mean, you... you get
this pit in your stomach

31:02.272 --> 31:03.439
when you think about it, right?

31:04.808 --> 31:06.610
Huh? Yes?

31:06.635 --> 31:09.470
This is a good thing, Joss.
It means you care about him.

31:09.495 --> 31:10.628
Okay, stop it. Even if you're right,

31:10.653 --> 31:11.786
which I am not saying that you are,

31:11.811 --> 31:13.652
how is this good? I
screwed it all up, Harry.

31:13.677 --> 31:15.377
He told me that his patient died,

31:15.402 --> 31:16.647
and I left while he was in the shower.

31:16.672 --> 31:18.997
Yeah, that part's not great.

31:19.268 --> 31:20.990
You should probably try to fix that.

31:22.053 --> 31:24.220
Unless it's already too late.

31:36.701 --> 31:38.726
- Hi.
- Hey.

31:38.751 --> 31:40.347
I'm really glad you're here.

31:41.961 --> 31:44.788
I know this is not the point, but I, uh...

31:44.813 --> 31:47.280
I told Zack that we
can't be friends anymore.

31:48.105 --> 31:51.600
You're right. Uh, that's not the point.

31:52.477 --> 31:54.278
No, the point is that, uh...

31:55.812 --> 31:57.271
You had all this stuff

31:57.296 --> 31:59.998
going on with you and I had no idea.

32:00.023 --> 32:01.299
Sweetie...

32:02.234 --> 32:03.801
There was nothing going on.

32:03.826 --> 32:05.326
Obviously, something was going on,

32:05.351 --> 32:07.391
or you wouldn't have made a new
best friend without telling me.

32:11.366 --> 32:16.170
You know where I was the
night that I saw you two?

32:16.729 --> 32:19.442
I was at a jewelry store buying you a gift

32:19.467 --> 32:21.857
to tell you that...

32:24.759 --> 32:26.327
I was ready to have a baby.

32:26.916 --> 32:29.525
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- I'm not... I'm not... I'm not

32:29.550 --> 32:32.079
trying to... to make you feel bad.

32:32.104 --> 32:33.581
I'm just trying to explain.

32:33.606 --> 32:36.741
Look, we are supposed to be
in this relationship together.

32:36.766 --> 32:38.470
- We are.
- But we're not.

32:38.513 --> 32:40.641
I mean, you're over
there in one relationship,

32:40.666 --> 32:42.533
and I'm all the way over here

32:42.558 --> 32:44.261
thinking it's something else entirely.

32:44.286 --> 32:45.293
Dom, that's not true.

32:45.318 --> 32:48.928
I don't think that we're as far
apart as you think that we are.

32:48.953 --> 32:51.922
Just because Zack has feelings for me...

32:51.947 --> 32:53.915
No, no. Don't... don't go
there, because that's...

32:53.940 --> 32:57.742
that's not it. That's...
Look, I may not like Zack

32:57.767 --> 32:59.734
or his feelings, but I get them.

32:59.759 --> 33:03.428
I get why he
was in this with you.

33:03.453 --> 33:05.755
Okay, I understand that you're mad

33:05.780 --> 33:07.414
that I didn't tell you, but I...

33:07.439 --> 33:09.774
No, but that's not even it, Savannah. D...

33:13.385 --> 33:17.689
Let's pretend I understood
you keeping it a secret.

33:17.714 --> 33:19.014
I mean, let's pretend

33:19.039 --> 33:22.018
that I could get over that part for now.

33:22.220 --> 33:25.856
I still don't understand why.

33:25.906 --> 33:29.152
What were you getting from him
that you couldn't get from me?

33:29.177 --> 33:32.437
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

33:32.462 --> 33:34.231
Then what was it about?!

33:34.360 --> 33:35.916
What did you want from him?

33:35.941 --> 33:38.376
There must... There must be some reason

33:38.511 --> 33:40.812
why you were keeping him in your life.

33:40.837 --> 33:44.906
I don't... I don't know,
Dom. I don't know, okay?

33:44.931 --> 33:48.300
- Yeah, well...
- You need to figure that out.

33:49.223 --> 33:52.156
You need to take some time

33:52.772 --> 33:54.233
and think...

33:56.114 --> 33:57.247
Alone.

33:58.064 --> 34:01.416
And until you get it clear in your head...

34:05.104 --> 34:06.938
let's call it a break.

35:13.362 --> 35:16.331
Hello.

35:17.132 --> 35:19.434
Oh. Come on up.

35:53.827 --> 35:54.871
So...

35:56.438 --> 35:58.847
I broke up with her.

36:21.989 --> 36:24.313
Hey, you're pretty good.

36:26.493 --> 36:29.829
Well, it's a lot easier when
no one's actually guarding you.

36:33.900 --> 36:35.234
I'm sorry about your patient.

36:37.814 --> 36:40.239
And... and I'm...

36:40.274 --> 36:42.241
Really sorry that I disappeared.

36:42.276 --> 36:44.410
I...

36:44.445 --> 36:46.412
It was immature, and it was wrong.

36:46.447 --> 36:49.482
And I just... I panicked,
and I couldn't process, and...

36:49.516 --> 36:51.951
I handled it all really
horribly. I'm sorry.

36:51.985 --> 36:53.786
Well, I'm not gonna argue that with you.

36:54.534 --> 36:55.621
Ouch.

36:55.655 --> 36:56.866
Although...

36:57.824 --> 36:59.959
I mean, I guess if we're
being fair, you know,

36:59.993 --> 37:01.460
how could you have known, right?

37:01.495 --> 37:03.171
- I didn't...
- And...

37:03.830 --> 37:05.521
You're right. I'm not a cardiac surgeon.

37:05.546 --> 37:07.308
Oh, God, I never should have said that!

37:07.333 --> 37:08.601
Obviously, what you do is amazing.

37:08.635 --> 37:09.934
It's not amazing.

37:09.969 --> 37:12.637
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's not, and to tell you the truth,

37:12.671 --> 37:14.973
I'm not always proud of
what I do for a living.

37:15.007 --> 37:16.240
What?

37:17.479 --> 37:20.261
Wow. That's the first time
I've ever said that out loud.

37:20.286 --> 37:22.088
Hey, you don't need to
be so hard on yourself.

37:22.113 --> 37:24.541
Yeah, I do. It's... it's what inspires me

37:24.583 --> 37:26.384
to go to these third-world
countries, you know... do things

37:26.418 --> 37:29.453
that actually make a difference,
that actually mean something.

37:29.488 --> 37:32.315
'Cause let's face it, what I do here is...

37:32.825 --> 37:35.627
Is kind of douchey.

37:35.661 --> 37:37.028
Hey, I really wish

37:37.062 --> 37:40.364
that you wouldn't talk about
my boyfriend in that tone, okay?

37:40.399 --> 37:42.417
Because what he does
makes people happy, mister.

37:42.636 --> 37:44.601
And what's more important than that?

37:45.291 --> 37:47.905
It's kind of like, you know,
what I do as a party planner.

37:47.939 --> 37:49.339
Yeah, no, I never thought about it.

37:49.373 --> 37:50.674
It's like we have the same job.

37:50.708 --> 37:52.843
That's exactly what I was saying.

37:54.879 --> 37:56.346
Mm. You know what?

37:56.380 --> 37:58.514
It turns out I wasn't even
mad at you for being late.

37:59.350 --> 38:02.478
I was actually jealous
of all of these women

38:02.503 --> 38:04.692
- that think that you walk on water.
- Wait a minute.

38:04.717 --> 38:07.479
- You're jealous?
- Yeah, I know. First time.

38:07.504 --> 38:09.685
- Ladies and gentlemen, she is jealous.
- I know! Stop! First time.

38:09.710 --> 38:11.124
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't want to talk about it.

38:11.149 --> 38:12.616
You know what? Let's
just clear this up, okay?

38:12.641 --> 38:14.484
You have nothing to be jealous of...

38:15.051 --> 38:18.705
Because I am 100%...

38:18.969 --> 38:21.397
Massively... actually, annoyingly...

38:21.422 --> 38:23.891
- Done with me?
- in love with you.

38:24.490 --> 38:25.597
What?

38:26.693 --> 38:28.397
And, um...

38:31.315 --> 38:33.049
I think you should move in with me.

38:35.424 --> 38:37.400
Wait, did you just... did you
just ask me to move in with you?

38:37.425 --> 38:39.299
Yeah. Yeah, I kind of did.

38:39.531 --> 38:40.598
- Uh...
- Well, think about it.

38:40.623 --> 38:42.758
You're gonna need a
place to stay soon, right?

38:42.783 --> 38:45.718
And I want to spend as much
time with you as I possibly can.

38:46.154 --> 38:47.187
Uh-huh.

38:47.212 --> 38:49.086
Two birds, one stone. What do you think?

38:52.634 --> 38:54.301
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

38:54.326 --> 38:55.534
Uh... Okay.

38:55.559 --> 38:56.895
- Come here.
- Let's do it.

38:56.920 --> 38:59.097
Mm.

39:00.858 --> 39:03.527
- I missed you.
- I missed you, too.

39:04.775 --> 39:06.909
- Yes!
- I had to do it!

39:07.498 --> 39:10.834
See you at home.

39:15.918 --> 39:17.232
Hey.

39:19.702 --> 39:22.179
- Thanks for coming to meet me.
- Oh, no, sure!

39:22.213 --> 39:24.424
I needed an excuse to get out of the house.

39:24.449 --> 39:26.152
Right.

39:26.705 --> 39:28.772
- So, is there a m...
- Would you like a drink?

39:28.797 --> 39:30.430
Menu?

39:30.455 --> 39:33.423
I don't even know why I asked
that. I'm not even hungry.

39:35.023 --> 39:36.290
So, yeah, um...

39:36.315 --> 39:38.283
There's something I need
to tell you, and I just...

39:38.308 --> 39:40.175
I thought I should do it in person.

39:40.200 --> 39:41.717
Okay.

39:42.233 --> 39:43.433
What is it?

39:43.458 --> 39:46.339
It's  nothing bad. I, uh...

39:47.257 --> 39:48.724
I'm moving back to Australia.

39:49.283 --> 39:50.582
What?

39:50.607 --> 39:52.741
It probably seems a bit sudden,

39:52.766 --> 39:54.561
but I've been thinking about
it for a while, to be honest.

39:54.586 --> 39:56.186
And an opportunity has presented itself,

39:56.211 --> 39:58.609
so I figured... Why not now?

39:58.634 --> 40:00.301
So, is this happening soon?

40:00.326 --> 40:02.797
Well, I'm not leaving for a
few weeks. I'd like to be here

40:02.822 --> 40:04.767
until the house sale
is taken care of, but...

40:05.002 --> 40:07.436
Even if I'm gone, you can
always reach me, right?

40:11.271 --> 40:12.490
Yeah.

40:13.634 --> 40:15.101
Okay.

40:16.065 --> 40:17.902
You all right?

40:17.927 --> 40:20.396
No. No.

40:20.421 --> 40:22.273
I'm not.

40:25.230 --> 40:27.749
I really made a mess of things, didn't it?

40:28.644 --> 40:30.448
I don't know, Sav.

40:31.061 --> 40:33.730
Maybe everything happens for a reason.

40:35.048 --> 40:37.182
Yeah, maybe.

40:38.077 --> 40:39.446
Just, uh...

40:39.751 --> 40:41.718
Right now, having...

40:41.753 --> 40:45.422
A hard time seeing what
that reason might be.

41:01.050 --> 41:02.471
April.

41:03.344 --> 41:04.969
I wasn't sure if you'd be here.

41:05.351 --> 41:08.270
I thought that if you weren't
here, it would be a sign, but...

41:09.007 --> 41:10.473
You are.

41:10.687 --> 41:11.787
You're here.

41:13.615 --> 41:14.749
You want to talk?

41:14.774 --> 41:15.869
Not really.

41:18.308 --> 41:20.528
I just need to be with you right now.

41:20.553 --> 41:22.406
Can I just be with you?

41:22.431 --> 41:24.432
Hey, hey, hey.

41:31.901 --> 41:34.468
We are definitely doing that again.

41:34.932 --> 41:36.653
Definitely.

41:37.841 --> 41:39.474
A lot.

41:41.973 --> 41:44.993
Hey. Is it okay if I take a shower?

41:45.018 --> 41:46.154
Of course.

41:56.172 --> 41:58.903
There are towels in the closet on the left.

41:59.576 --> 42:00.843
Got it.

42:01.376 --> 42:04.311
Your phone's ringing!

42:04.336 --> 42:05.602
Sorry. Just ignore it.

42:05.627 --> 42:08.314
- It's... it's the girl.
- She programmed her own ringtone,

42:08.339 --> 42:10.172
which I now need to get rid of.
