McCabe.

01:29.065 --> 01:30.618
Let's go.

01:30.718 --> 01:33.720
- Go where?
- Your bail's been posted.

01:34.316 --> 01:35.919
By who?

01:36.019 --> 01:40.689
1 jacket, leather.
1 knapsack, left strap torn.

01:40.789 --> 01:44.453
Contents:
26 dollars in ones and fives.

01:44.553 --> 01:47.865
1 sketchbook, fashion designs.

01:47.965 --> 01:50.753
- Not bad.
- You looked through my sketchbook?

01:51.053 --> 01:53.151
I get bored.

01:53.251 --> 01:56.528
1 technical pen and 1 necklace.

01:57.562 --> 01:59.985
That's pretty. Where did you get it?

02:00.085 --> 02:02.895
- Family heirloom.
- Give you 20 bucks for it.

02:02.995 --> 02:06.827
It's the wife's birthday.
I... forgot to get her something.

02:06.927 --> 02:09.621
Tell you what - 50 bucks.

02:12.843 --> 02:14.793
Hey, sweetie.

02:19.893 --> 02:21.346
You posted my bail?

02:21.446 --> 02:24.009
Not the father-daughter reunion
I dreamt of, but...

02:24.109 --> 02:26.982
Good thing for both of us
you're not my father then.

02:27.082 --> 02:29.667
I told you no matter mow many fosters
you throw in front of it,

02:29.767 --> 02:31.326
I'm always gonna be your pop.

02:31.426 --> 02:34.724
Gotta say, though, it hurt a little -
you being back in Motor City

02:34.824 --> 02:36.923
- and not looking me up.
- Sorry,

02:37.023 --> 02:39.314
was busy getting thrown in jail.

02:39.414 --> 02:41.508
Wanna bite to eat?

02:41.708 --> 02:45.036
So, what brings you back to Detroit?

02:45.136 --> 02:47.180
- Job interview.
- Fashion design?

02:47.280 --> 02:48.898
The guy was a jerk.

02:48.998 --> 02:51.559
He said my work lacks identity.

02:51.659 --> 02:55.168
Which kind of makes sense, since I am
kinda black in identity myself.

02:55.268 --> 02:57.248
So you stabbed him in the hand
with a pencil.

02:57.348 --> 02:59.995
No. I stabbed him in the hand
with a pen.

03:00.191 --> 03:04.012
And that was only after he suggested
I could have the job if I gave him one.

03:04.112 --> 03:06.068
Betty would be proud of you for that.

03:06.168 --> 03:09.041
She always secretly liked
that you stood up for yourself.

03:09.141 --> 03:11.844
It doesn't feel the same
without her chewing me out right now.

03:11.944 --> 03:14.287
She always get so pissed off.

03:14.387 --> 03:16.749
Wish she was here right now.

03:16.849 --> 03:18.249
Me too.

03:20.959 --> 03:22.095
So...

03:22.195 --> 03:25.209
You find whatever it is you were
looking for outside of Michigan?

03:25.609 --> 03:27.323
You can say it.

03:27.423 --> 03:29.440
- My parents.
- So you find them?

03:29.540 --> 03:31.389
No, I found nothing.

03:31.489 --> 03:33.038
I...

03:33.138 --> 03:34.960
Give up the necklace, bitch.

03:35.060 --> 03:37.934
Here, here! 58 dollars inside.
It's yours! Just...

03:39.346 --> 03:40.974
I'm not gonna say it again.
Give me that necklace

03:41.074 --> 03:43.364
or you're gonna get a bullet
through your eye!
