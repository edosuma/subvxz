00:07.723 --> 00:10.025
    I'm doing a piece on the    
  psychological ramifications   

00:10.059 --> 00:13.194
of Ingmar Bergman's later works 
    for <i>American Film.</i>          

00:13.229 --> 00:14.179
        Oh, that's great, Fras. 

00:14.297 --> 00:15.597
I'd like to read it to you      

00:15.631 --> 00:16.898
to see if it's still accessible 
to the layman.                  

00:16.932 --> 00:18.633
    May I have your opinion?    

00:18.668 --> 00:22.537
Sure. Buy a new suit,           
get a haircut and stay home.    

00:23.756 --> 00:25.290
    Thank you, Carla.           

00:25.324 --> 00:27.859
Now, I call the piece           

00:27.894 --> 00:30.896
"Ingmar Bergman:                
Poet of the Subconscious."      

00:32.031 --> 00:33.698
The films of Ingmar Bergman...  

00:33.732 --> 00:35.867
         Who could forget her in
             <i>Casablanca,</i> huh?   

00:36.935 --> 00:39.253
    No, no...                   

00:39.288 --> 00:40.922
No, you're thinking             
of <i>Ingrid</i> Bergman.              

00:40.956 --> 00:42.857
I'm talking                     
about <i>Ingmar</i> Bergman.           

00:42.891 --> 00:45.059
Ingmar Bergman, the boxer?      

00:46.445 --> 00:48.796
      No, Woody, you're thinking
            of Ingmar Johansson.

00:48.831 --> 00:50.632
You mean the guy who            
knocked out Floyd Patterson?    

00:50.666 --> 00:52.567
    No, no, no-- Sonny Liston   
    knocked out Patterson.      

00:54.003 --> 00:54.669
Well, then who                  
knocked out Johansson?          

00:54.704 --> 00:55.686
                      Patterson.

00:55.721 --> 00:56.521
         Before Liston?         

00:56.555 --> 00:58.206
              No, no, Johansson 
             knocked out Liston.

00:58.240 --> 00:59.440
                 Who knocked out
                      Patterson?

00:59.475 --> 01:00.458
     Was it <i>Ingrid</i> Bergman?     

01:04.163 --> 01:05.180
No, <i>Ingrid</i> Bergman...           

01:05.214 --> 01:06.148
Shut up! Shut up!               

01:07.416 --> 01:09.284
Not one more word.              

01:09.318 --> 01:11.519
I came in here                  
to discuss Ingmar Bergman,      

01:11.553 --> 01:15.090
not start an Abbott             
and Costello routine.           

01:15.124 --> 01:19.094
             Actually, I thought
         it was more like Martin
        and Lewis, wasn't it?   

01:19.128 --> 01:21.396
You mean Joe Louis?             

01:21.430 --> 01:24.466
                Oh, he's the one
                who knocked out 
                Floyd Patterson.

01:25.534 --> 01:27.402
      Then who knocked out      
         Lou Costello?          

01:27.436 --> 01:30.271
Apparently, Ingrid Bergman.     

01:35.277 --> 01:37.745
      Boy, she was tougher      
        than she looked.

      I gave an interview.      

06:07.866 --> 06:10.000
I gave one hell of an interview.

06:10.035 --> 06:13.872

          I was witty.

         in the movie.          

06:17.943 --> 06:18.676
     You know, I gave them      

06:18.794 --> 06:20.628
    a million and one ideas     
    to promote Cheers.

before you went in there?       

06:31.256 --> 06:33.441
Yes, I jotted down a few notes. 

06:33.476 --> 06:36.144
 Were you using a fountain pen? 

06:36.178 --> 06:39.096
     My lucky fountain pen.     

06:39.131 --> 06:43.100
            Make that your      
            leaky fountain...   

06:43.135 --> 06:44.936
              Oh.               

06:44.970 --> 06:46.838
        I don't believe this!   

06:46.872 --> 06:48.773
    And I thought they were     
    really impressed with me,   

06:48.807 --> 06:49.908
      and they were just staring

06:49.942 --> 06:51.910
                at this big, old
                stupid ink blot.

06:51.944 --> 06:53.678
              It's not that bad,
              Miss Howe.        

06:53.712 --> 06:55.246
    It's kind of decorative.    

06:55.280 --> 06:57.248
  It looks like, uh, a bunny.   

06:59.918 --> 07:01.085
                No, no, it looks
                 like a spider. 

07:01.120 --> 07:02.587
Or a butterfly.                 

07:02.621 --> 07:04.822
    It looks like my parents    
  having a screaming argument   

07:04.856 --> 07:05.856
      on my third birthday      

07:05.890 --> 07:07.675
        when I pretended        
    to be asleep but wasn't.    

07:13.765 --> 07:16.500
        Or a butterfly.         

07:20.739 --> 07:22.272
     Afternoon, everybody.      

07:22.307 --> 07:23.525
        Yo-ho.                  
                        ALL:    
                        Norm!   

07:23.559 --> 07:24.792
Beer, Norm?                     

07:24.826 --> 07:25.910
Have I gotten that predictable? 

07:25.944 --> 07:27.779
             Good.              

07:27.813 --> 07:30.347
Hey, weren't you supposed to    
have a painting job today?      

07:30.382 --> 07:31.983
                  You're right, 
                 Cliffie, I did,

07:32.017 --> 07:33.301
            but I screwed it up.

07:33.335 --> 07:35.653
    Turns out I was supposed    
     to show up yesterday.      

07:35.687 --> 07:38.055
  So they went ahead and hired  
         somebody else.         

07:38.089 --> 07:41.793
  Like they couldn't open the   
  restaurant a damn day later.  

07:41.827 --> 07:43.260
Well, you know,                 
you might be                    

07:43.295 --> 07:45.029
the world's greatest            
house painter--                 

07:45.063 --> 07:46.697
although who would know         
the difference?                 

07:48.550 --> 07:49.366
But, you know,                  
as a businessman,               

07:49.401 --> 07:51.519
you really leave a lot          
to be desired, you know.        

07:51.553 --> 07:53.488
You haven't had a job           
in three months.                

07:53.522 --> 07:56.290
                Cliff, you're   
            absolutely right.   

07:56.325 --> 07:58.142
I could do something about that.

07:58.176 --> 08:00.244
Or I could sit right here       
and feel sorry for myself       

08:00.279 --> 08:01.912
  and nurse this beer all day.  

08:01.946 --> 08:03.698
 And since I'm already here...  

08:06.902 --> 08:08.402
Wait a minute.                  

08:08.436 --> 08:09.536
Here we have a man              

08:09.571 --> 08:12.706
who doesn't know how            
to promote his business.        

08:12.741 --> 08:15.176
And here we have a woman        
who knows everything            
about promotion,                

08:15.210 --> 08:17.711
but has never really            
been given a chance.            

08:18.747 --> 08:20.948
    Now, if I can turn          
     a beer-guzzling nobody     

08:20.982 --> 08:23.167
into a successful               
businessman,                    

08:23.201 --> 08:25.302
      then those guys down there
        at corporate will see   

08:25.336 --> 08:26.503
         that I can do anything.

08:26.538 --> 08:29.841
 Uh, much as I love your pitch, 
        Rebecca...              

08:29.875 --> 08:32.376
    uh, I'm not comfortable     
     working with friends.      

08:32.409 --> 08:33.659
Oh, forget about friends.       

08:33.695 --> 08:35.379
In the cold light               
of reason,                      

08:35.413 --> 08:36.964
         consider this:         

08:36.999 --> 08:39.666
    Please, please, please,     
        for Becky?              

08:39.701 --> 08:41.885
            Nah, nah, I'd rather
                 work by myself.

08:41.919 --> 08:43.136
    Fine, Norm, fine.           

08:43.171 --> 08:44.238
    I'll just go back           

08:44.273 --> 08:46.023
to what I was doing--           

08:46.058 --> 08:48.926
        going over these        
    delinquent bar accounts.    

08:50.396 --> 08:52.763
             Whoa.              

08:54.583 --> 08:58.286
 Now there's a rather huge one  
      in the "P" section.       

08:58.320 --> 09:00.288
Welcome to Team Peterson.       

09:05.510 --> 09:06.977
Nothing like bicycling          

09:07.012 --> 09:08.946
to clean the garbage            
out of your system.             

09:08.980 --> 09:10.648
Coffee, Woody.                  

09:10.682 --> 09:11.849
                      How do you
                want it, Sam?   

09:11.883 --> 09:14.785
Uh, straight,                   
no cream, no sugar.             

09:14.819 --> 09:16.888
Oh, what the hell--             
forget the water,               

09:16.922 --> 09:18.806
just give me                    
a handful of grounds.           

09:20.976 --> 09:22.643
Hey, uh, Sammy,                 
the old Erin machine's          

09:22.678 --> 09:24.144
really tuckering                
you out, huh?                   

09:24.179 --> 09:25.780
No, no, I'm fine.               

09:25.814 --> 09:27.481
I just need a little something  
to pick me up here.             

09:27.516 --> 09:29.416
How about six pallbearers?      

09:31.920 --> 09:33.136
You guys are just jealous       

09:33.171 --> 09:35.639
    because I'm toning          
        and you're not.         

09:36.708 --> 09:37.792
I am buff.                      

09:37.826 --> 09:40.862
I mean I am discovering muscles 
I didn't even know I had.       

09:40.896 --> 09:44.048
        Oh! There's one.        

09:44.083 --> 09:45.449
        That feels good,        
    that feels good, though.    

09:45.483 --> 09:47.051
Ah! All right,                  
I've got to go change.          

09:47.085 --> 09:49.620
        I'm meeting Erin        
         to go jogging.         

09:49.654 --> 09:51.255
What's wrong                    
with our lives?                 

09:51.290 --> 09:56.794
        Yeah, we have lousy jobs
                  with poor pay,

09:56.828 --> 09:59.480
      we both waste all our time
             sitting on our cans

09:59.514 --> 10:02.466
         in this beer hall doing
         nothing but watching TV

10:02.500 --> 10:04.618
              and gossiping like
         a couple of old ladies,

10:04.653 --> 10:09.323
            plus everyone thinks
                  we're dufuses.

10:09.358 --> 10:11.359
Geez, you know,                 
I was just going                

10:11.393 --> 10:13.227
to say we could probably use    
a little bit more exercise,     

10:13.261 --> 10:16.964
but, uh, I'll go along          
with what you said.             

10:19.501 --> 10:22.370
Oh, Norm, there you are.        

10:22.404 --> 10:24.405
            Oh, gee,            
    how'd you track me down?    

10:27.675 --> 10:30.744
             I got some terrific
         ideas for 4-A Painting.

10:30.778 --> 10:32.429
That's what you're going to call
    the company, huh?           

10:32.464 --> 10:34.081
            Yeah, it's an old   
            marketing secret.   

10:34.115 --> 10:36.918
          It puts our name first
          in the phone book.    

10:36.952 --> 10:39.420
                    How come 4A?
                    Why not 3A? 

10:39.454 --> 10:40.888
                  Because that's
                  the Auto Club.

10:40.922 --> 10:43.574
     Wow, they got jumper cables
          and they paint houses?

10:43.608 --> 10:44.942
                I've got to join
                      that club.

10:45.994 --> 10:47.945
                  Woody, this is
             a business meeting.

10:47.979 --> 10:51.699
            Sorry! Next time,   
            I'll wear a suit.   

10:54.686 --> 10:56.604
            Anyway... all right.

10:56.638 --> 11:00.024
    All successful businesses   
        and products have logos.

11:00.058 --> 11:01.758
             Now, I have come up

11:01.793 --> 11:03.811
            with the perfect,   
                     delightful,

11:03.846 --> 11:07.064
    charming little character   
      to symbolize 4-A Painting.

11:11.653 --> 11:14.221
         It's a lizard.         

11:14.256 --> 11:17.208
    No, it's Carl Chameleon.    

11:18.710 --> 11:21.445
    Now, like all chameleons,   
    Carl changes colors.        

11:21.479 --> 11:23.798
    And so should your house.   

11:23.832 --> 11:28.685
When you think of color change  
think of Carl and 4-A Painting. 

11:31.089 --> 11:33.007
 That sure makes my old symbol  
    seem like nothing.          

11:33.041 --> 11:34.409
                What was your   
                    old symbol? 

11:34.443 --> 11:38.212
    Nothing.                    

11:38.246 --> 11:38.979
                All right, Norm,

11:39.013 --> 11:39.864
      I gotta computerize       
         the accounts,          

11:39.898 --> 11:40.765
      I've gotta get some       

11:40.799 --> 11:41.699
      advertising set up,       

11:41.733 --> 11:42.833
        and I gotta get a new   

11:42.868 --> 11:43.968
        phone line installed.   

11:44.002 --> 11:45.786
      Whoa, wait, how much      
is all this gonna cost me?      

11:45.820 --> 11:46.820
            Minimal.            

11:46.854 --> 11:48.922
 $2,000, $3,000 to begin with.  

11:50.808 --> 11:53.010
     I'm beginning to think     
         AAAA Painting          

11:53.044 --> 11:56.146
        is gonna cost me        
        a-a-a-a fortune.        

11:56.181 --> 11:58.599
It's making you                 
stutter, too.                   

11:58.634 --> 12:01.451
CLIFF:                          
Nah, nah,                       

12:01.486 --> 12:03.120
      but, uh, seems like       
     Rebecca is costing you     

12:03.155 --> 12:04.638
        more money              
     than she's making you.     

12:04.673 --> 12:06.774
You thinking of giving her      
    the old pink slip?          

12:06.808 --> 12:08.943
I couldn't do that, Cliff.      

12:08.977 --> 12:10.077
FRASIER:                        
Well, you know, Norm,           

12:10.111 --> 12:12.012
I think we all agree            
that letting somebody go        

12:12.047 --> 12:13.514
      is the most painful,      
         difficult task         

12:13.549 --> 12:14.715
    someone could undertake.    

12:14.750 --> 12:16.450
    I'll do it.                 

12:16.484 --> 12:19.954
 Carla, this is Norm's problem. 
    He has to do it himself.    

12:19.988 --> 12:22.957
            You're absolutely   
                 right, Frasier,
                     and I will.

12:22.991 --> 12:25.225
                 Carla, go fire 
                Rebecca, please.

12:25.260 --> 12:28.796
    No, no, no, nope, Norm,     
 you've got to do it yourself.  

12:28.831 --> 12:30.664
      You've got to do it       
          right away.           

12:30.699 --> 12:32.233
     Otherwise, it'll just      
exacerbate the situation.       

12:32.267 --> 12:34.001
You can do it, man.             

12:34.036 --> 12:35.803
          Be dauntless          
        and implacable.         

12:35.837 --> 12:36.503

            Yeah!               

12:40.608 --> 12:42.176

That's it.

    did your car break down?

 Whatever you do, don't leave.  

13:43.588 --> 13:47.057
I think I'll cruise by on

  How does that make you feel?  

14:52.823 --> 14:54.591
              Makes me feel like
              having a Big Mac

             and a bucket

              and breathe this  
              stagnant city air.

    I'm gonna go climb          
     a mountain with Erin.

         you, actually.         

15:19.451 --> 15:21.185
    Yeah?                       
            Most of us live such
            sedentary lives.    

15:21.219 --> 15:23.737
            You're out there    
            taxing your body.   

15:23.772 --> 15:25.172
                 It's-it's quite
                 an inspiration.

15:25.206 --> 15:27.007
    I know, Frasier.            

15:27.041 --> 15:28.843
    Make me stop.               

15:28.877 --> 15:31.629
I tell you, man.

I can't catch my breath anymore.

are beginning                   

15:35.433 --> 15:37.434
to form a conspiracy to kill me 

15:37.469 --> 15:39.470
because they want               
to get some rest.

      Let's get you out of this.

Sam, if all this                
strenuous exercise              

15:43.608 --> 15:46.843
is taxing you that much,        
you know, perhaps it's time     

15:46.877 --> 15:49.396
to face the passing of the years
and learn to deal with it.      

15:49.430 --> 15:50.664
            What do you mean?   

15:50.699 --> 15:53.233
              Admit that I'm 30?

15:56.071 --> 15:57.654
I wouldn't suggest              
anything that drastic,          

15:57.688 --> 15:59.623
but, uh,                        
maybe you ought to just,        

15:59.657 --> 16:01.391
you know, slow it down a bit.   

16:01.426 --> 16:03.393

16:05.847 --> 16:06.780
                  Ooh, good one.

16:06.815 --> 16:08.082
                  Uh, could you 
                  do me a favor?

16:08.116 --> 16:10.417
      Sit down here, uh...      

16:10.451 --> 16:11.418
                     Listen,    
                     sweetheart.

16:11.452 --> 16:12.419
             I-I'm not gonna go,

16:12.453 --> 16:15.923
          uh, climbing          
          the mountain with you.

16:15.957 --> 16:17.557
        What's up?              

16:17.592 --> 16:20.727
             I guess I better   
             be honest with you.

16:20.762 --> 16:23.431
          It's just that all    
          this physical activity

16:23.465 --> 16:25.166
         we've been engaging in,

16:25.200 --> 16:28.402
            it's just           
            too much for... you.

16:28.437 --> 16:29.937
I mean, come on,                
I'm a guy who likes             

16:29.971 --> 16:31.538
to go, go, go.                  
( <i>snaps fingers</i> )               

16:31.572 --> 16:32.840
            And, uh, sweetheart,

16:32.874 --> 16:35.042
     you're just slowing me down
     a little bit. I'm sorry.   

16:35.076 --> 16:39.279
Sam, I'm really kind of relieved
     to hear you say that.      

16:39.313 --> 16:40.531
I guess I need                  
to go                           

16:40.565 --> 16:43.167
and find myself a guy who       
wants to just join me           

16:43.201 --> 16:44.735
in a nice, hot bubble bath      

16:44.769 --> 16:46.803
and lie in bed                  
with me all evening.            

16:46.838 --> 16:48.672
    See ya.                     

16:56.547 --> 17:00.417
Gee, that was, uh, sort of      
    ironic, wasn't it, Sam?     

17:04.439 --> 17:06.773
I'm gonna go home               

17:06.808 --> 17:10.277
     and take a little nap.     

17:10.310 --> 17:11.478
Maybe ease into                 
a bubble bath,                  

17:11.512 --> 17:14.147

Just do it, babe.

the new director of advertising.

Oh, God, really?

        Well!                   

17:50.118 --> 17:53.970
There is some crap up           
with which I will not put.      

17:55.690 --> 17:58.726
 Well, I guess with 4-A on the  
verge of making a breakthrough, 

17:58.760 --> 18:01.228
this is just the kick           
in the pants I needed.

to corporate headquarters,

    to go to the top floor,

and I am going to tell          
the CEO himself what            

18:07.402 --> 18:09.036
         I think of him         
    and his stinky company.

              Whoa, no, Rebecca,

18:10.205 --> 18:11.505
             don't you think you
             ought to wait      

18:11.539 --> 18:13.007
              till we have      
              at least two jobs?

18:17.411 --> 18:19.680
      I'm doing it, babe.       

18:19.714 --> 18:21.481

    For four of those,          
     I didn't get a raise.

  been treated like hell. Hmm.

         But I've never         
    been happier in my life.
