01:12.839 --> 01:14.807
Can't sleep?

01:14.841 --> 01:17.002
No, can't sleep.

01:18.011 --> 01:20.411
You miss her,
don't you?

01:20.447 --> 01:22.881
More than words.

01:22.916 --> 01:25.407
It says we're supposed to hug.
I ain't hugging you.

01:25.452 --> 01:27.010
Don't be a wiseass, Turtle.

01:27.053 --> 01:28.987
Just read the lines
like Brooke would.

01:29.022 --> 01:31.923
- How am I supposed to do that?
- Focus.

01:31.958 --> 01:34.051
Radiate, emote.

01:34.094 --> 01:36.221
You know, Brooke Shields
was the first girl

01:36.262 --> 01:38.059
I ever seriously
jerked off to.

01:38.098 --> 01:40.760
That's romantic, Drama.
You should tell her.

01:40.800 --> 01:42.495
Yeah, Lady Fate knew
what she was doing

01:42.535 --> 01:44.264
when she delivered her
to my doorstep.

01:44.304 --> 01:46.295
You're a couple of scenes
on a M.O.W.

01:46.339 --> 01:48.739
It ain't fate and you ain't banging
Brooke Shields.

01:48.775 --> 01:52.006
The on-set romance is
a time-honored Hollywood tradition.

01:52.045 --> 01:53.569
- Wake up!
- Ain't she married?

01:53.613 --> 01:55.672
Yeah, to a writer.

01:55.715 --> 01:58.149
I mean, come on.
Me or a writer?

01:58.184 --> 02:00.118
All right, guys, Let's roll!

02:00.153 --> 02:02.553
We don't want to be late
showing up at Terrance's.

02:02.589 --> 02:05.114
Oh, check it out.
E's got the shiny hair again.

02:05.158 --> 02:08.286
- Hopin' Sloan will be there?
- Sloan doesn't live with her father,

02:08.328 --> 02:10.955
- but I am having dinner with her.
- Nice.

02:10.997 --> 02:13.397
- Don't mention that to Terrance.
- Why, is it a secret?

02:13.433 --> 02:15.663
We're meeting with the head
of your agency for your business,

02:15.702 --> 02:18.967
- not my personal life. Let's go.
- All right.

02:19.005 --> 02:21.235
What time did you roll in
last night, Vince?

02:21.274 --> 02:24.243
- Yeah, late night, huh?
- What, did I break curfew?

02:24.277 --> 02:27.269
Look, if you guys have a question,
why don't you just ask it?

02:27.313 --> 02:30.373
Okay, what the fuck's going
on with you and Mandy?

02:30.416 --> 02:33.010
- Yeah, what's up, Vince?
- I didn't know you guys cared.

02:33.052 --> 02:35.384
- Come on!
- All right.

02:35.421 --> 02:37.616
Mandy broke up with Chris,
now we're together.

02:37.657 --> 02:39.488
And I'm happy,
so don't give me any shit.

02:39.526 --> 02:41.585
Tomorrow's her birthday,
I gotta do something special.

02:41.628 --> 02:44.096
It's been 24 hours.
I think flowers will do.

02:44.130 --> 02:46.655
You should have started
dating her next week, bro.

02:46.699 --> 02:48.394
You could've saved
yourself some coin.

02:48.434 --> 02:50.834
I remember I broke up
with Stacy Laruzso

02:50.870 --> 02:52.735
a week before Valentine's Day.

02:52.772 --> 02:54.239
I got back with her
a week after.

02:54.274 --> 02:56.367
No chocolates, no roses.

02:56.409 --> 02:57.899
No class.

02:57.944 --> 02:59.809
Pull!

03:01.948 --> 03:03.973
Good shot.

03:04.017 --> 03:07.544
I can already see E hanging
in the den next to the elk.

03:07.587 --> 03:09.885
Attention to details, Vince,

03:09.923 --> 03:12.585
that's the sure-fire way
into any woman's heart.

03:12.625 --> 03:14.991
You know, when I was courting
Ann-Margaret

03:15.028 --> 03:17.792
I used fly in truffles
from her favorite bistro in Avignon.

03:17.830 --> 03:20.765
Fly in some steaks from Peter Luger's,
Vince. If nothing else,

03:20.800 --> 03:23.200
- I'll love you forever.
- Well, actually, Turtle,

03:23.236 --> 03:26.535
I was going to suggest
a private little dinner party

03:26.573 --> 03:29.133
at my restaurant.
My treat, of course.

03:29.175 --> 03:31.803
That's sounds great.
Is it cool if I invite the guys?

03:31.844 --> 03:34.074
I'd love Mandy
to meet the family,

03:34.113 --> 03:37.014
- maybe take her to Napa for a weekend.
- Absolutely.

03:37.050 --> 03:40.178
What? You don't like Napa
or you don't want to get to know Mandy?

03:40.220 --> 03:42.450
Hey, maybe I'll bring Brooke.

03:42.488 --> 03:45.980
Get to know her so that we feel
comfortable for our love scene.

03:46.025 --> 03:48.016
The more the merrier, Johnny.

03:48.061 --> 03:51.121
Now, are you guys just gonna stand here
or are you gonna shoot?

03:51.164 --> 03:53.257
First up,
the North Hollywood

03:53.299 --> 03:56.063
Paintball Tournament
M.V.P. three years running!

03:56.102 --> 03:58.332
Whose whole family's
of Sicilian ancestry?

03:58.371 --> 04:00.737
Your grandmother ran numbers
out of a deli, Turtle.

04:00.773 --> 04:02.070
You're far from a made man.

04:02.108 --> 04:04.372
- Yeah, we'll see.
- Pull!

04:05.411 --> 04:07.538
- Yeah!
- I got that!

04:07.580 --> 04:09.548
- That was mine!
- I totally got that!

04:09.582 --> 04:12.608
- That was clearly my shot.
- You saw that?

04:12.652 --> 04:15.951
You know, you're a natural
with a gun, Vince.

04:15.989 --> 04:17.649
You should be working
with Tarantino.

04:17.690 --> 04:20.659
I'd love to. I've been wanting to meet
him since I moved out here.

04:20.692 --> 04:22.718
Really?

04:22.762 --> 04:25.162
- How about next week?
- Seriously?

04:25.198 --> 04:27.996
Most assuredly.
Quentin's an old mate of mine.

04:28.034 --> 04:30.502
Who do you think pulled him out
of that bloody video store?

04:30.536 --> 04:32.561
Yeah, Vince, let's do
a Tarantino movie.

04:32.605 --> 04:34.573
He could revive me
like he did for Travolta.

04:34.607 --> 04:37.337
Be more like reviving
Freddie Boom Boom Washington.

04:37.377 --> 04:41.507
Listen, Vincent, I've got over 30 years
experience in this business,

04:41.547 --> 04:43.674
and the Rolodex
that goes with it.

04:43.716 --> 04:45.707
All of which are now
at your disposal.

04:45.752 --> 04:49.449
There are no boundaries,
just possibilities.

04:50.857 --> 04:52.916
Excuse me.

04:52.959 --> 04:55.860
- What's up, Shauna?
- What are you so chipper about?

04:55.895 --> 04:57.886
I just had a great day
shooting with Terrance.

04:57.930 --> 05:00.660
- Don't put your guns away just yet.
- Why, what's the problem?

05:00.700 --> 05:04.101
"Page Six" just outed
Vince and Mandy. Bang-bang.

05:05.938 --> 05:08.600
"What soon-to-be super actor
gets along so swimmingly

05:08.641 --> 05:12.304
with his engaged co-star that friends
say her pending nuptials are drowning?"

05:12.345 --> 05:14.142
- How can you let this happen?
- Me?

05:14.180 --> 05:15.977
- Yeah.
- He's the one doing the swimming.

05:16.015 --> 05:19.041
It's your job to make sure what he does
stays out of the papers.

05:19.085 --> 05:21.451
- I thought that was her job.
- It's your job to let me know

05:21.487 --> 05:24.149
what needs to be kept out,
then I'll keep it out of the papers!

05:24.190 --> 05:26.090
A little less time
on the firing range,

05:26.125 --> 05:28.252
a little more time
as a manager, perhaps.

05:28.294 --> 05:30.592
What did you and Terrance
talk about anyway?

05:30.630 --> 05:34.066
He offered me your job. I turned him
down 'cause your office is too small.

05:34.100 --> 05:37.331
Guys, what am I doing here?
I feel like I have a coke problem.

05:37.370 --> 05:38.997
What's the real issue, Ari?

05:39.038 --> 05:42.064
The real issue is that
Dana Gordon called

05:42.108 --> 05:44.167
and Warner Brothers
is very concerned.

05:45.278 --> 05:46.711
You're kidding, right?

05:46.746 --> 05:49.306
You're their million dollar baby!
They don't want you pulling

05:49.349 --> 05:51.283
- an Angelina Jolie!
- Or a Russell Crowe.

05:51.317 --> 05:53.877
He broke up Dennis Quaid
and Meg Ryan on "Proof of Life".

05:53.920 --> 05:56.946
Movie cost 80 mil,
did less business than "Gigli".

05:56.989 --> 05:58.923
Guys, relax.

05:58.958 --> 06:01.518
Mandy's not even engaged
anymore. They broke up.

06:01.561 --> 06:04.428
And you're gonna come off
as the reason for that.

06:04.464 --> 06:07.558
The last thing we need is soccer moms
in the fly-over states

06:07.600 --> 06:09.795
thinking that Aquaman
is a home wrecker.

06:09.836 --> 06:12.566
I had a good time last time.
I'd love to have dinner with him.

06:12.605 --> 06:15.631
I just don't want to get stuck
with the bill again.

06:15.675 --> 06:18.235
- Is that the husband?
- Huh?

06:18.277 --> 06:20.711
Brooke's husband,
is that him over there?

06:20.747 --> 06:23.477
Oh, I don't know.

06:23.516 --> 06:25.609
Not good looking.

06:28.621 --> 06:31.181
I'm not saying
don't date her.

06:31.224 --> 06:32.714
I'm just saying
be discreet.

06:32.759 --> 06:34.454
No hand-holding
at The Grove.

06:34.494 --> 06:37.520
- No canoodling on Melrose.
- Canoodling?

06:37.563 --> 06:39.929
No fingerbanging
her courtside at the Lakers game.

06:39.966 --> 06:41.831
- What?
- Fuck you guys!

06:41.868 --> 06:45.360
I'm making a point here... No cameras.
A "Page Six" rumor is one thing.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.100
Cover of "Us Weekly"
quite another.

06:47.140 --> 06:49.233
- We get it. Jesus!
- Do you get it, E?

06:49.275 --> 06:51.903
When he goes out, I want you
and the retards to be with him.

06:51.944 --> 06:54.970
If anyone tries to take a picture you,
go fucking Sean Penn on them.

06:55.014 --> 06:57.141
Hey, when did you get
this Robert Neitsch?

06:57.183 --> 06:58.650
Good eye.
I just hung her.

06:58.684 --> 07:00.584
- And it's Nitch, by the way.
- Really?

07:00.620 --> 07:04.021
I paid for it with Eva Longoria's
commission. That's how I roll.

07:04.056 --> 07:07.253
- Nitch is Mandy's favorite artist.
- I thought Beyonce was.

07:07.293 --> 07:10.456
Don't be mean to Mandy just because
you're mad at me.

07:10.496 --> 07:13.590
Ari, will you let me
buy this painting for Mandy's birthday?

07:13.633 --> 07:16.033
- Are you nuts?
- Maybe.

07:16.068 --> 07:18.366
- What do you say?
- Are you serious?

07:18.404 --> 07:20.838
- Yeah, how much?
- It's $100,000...

07:20.873 --> 07:23.569
- E, talk to your boy, please.
- For you?

07:23.609 --> 07:25.804
Why? Terrance would
sell it to him.

07:25.845 --> 07:28.541
Shit, he'd probably give it to him.
That's how I roll.

07:28.581 --> 07:31.516
Lloyd, you were
an Art History major

07:31.551 --> 07:33.883
- at Sarah Lawrence College, right?
- Yes, I was.

07:33.920 --> 07:36.081
Then you know how to pull
this down off the wall.

07:36.122 --> 07:38.488
Grab it and put it down in Vinnie's car.
Chop-chop!

07:38.524 --> 07:41.652
- You feeling the love?
- How much? $100,000?

07:41.694 --> 07:45.186
For you? Mmm, free. Think of it
as a start gift for "Aquaman".

07:45.231 --> 07:48.667
You gave me a juice maker for "Queens
Boulevard". We must be moving up.

07:48.701 --> 07:50.931
Like the goddamn Jeffersons.
Come here.

07:52.171 --> 07:54.901
Tell Terrance to top that,
little man.

07:55.007 --> 07:57.066
So Brooke looked
at you, huh, Drama?

07:57.109 --> 07:59.600
You know what?
To hell with you guys.

07:59.645 --> 08:02.273
I know when I'm vibing.
Me and Brooke, we're vibing.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.283
- Hello, Kathy.
- Hey, Vince.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.945
- Just four.
- Uh, no, there's gonna be five.

08:06.986 --> 08:08.954
- There is?
- Yeah, Mandy's joining us.

08:08.988 --> 08:11.889
We're supposed to lay low.
What if somebody takes a picture?

08:11.924 --> 08:14.950
E, relax.
This is Jerry's, not The Ivy.

08:14.994 --> 08:16.621
Do you see any paparazzi?

08:16.662 --> 08:18.960
You never know where
these scumbags are hiding.

08:18.998 --> 08:22.434
These guys are right. Why do you think
I always sit next to you in restaurants?

08:22.468 --> 08:24.959
- Just in case.
- All right, take it easy.

08:25.004 --> 08:27.871
- I want to enjoy my tuna melt.
- We're worried about you.

08:27.907 --> 08:31.070
Yeah, Vince. We don't wanna see
this girl crush you again.

08:31.110 --> 08:33.874
All right, guys, stop it.
Here she is.

08:33.913 --> 08:35.346
Now, be nice.

08:35.381 --> 08:37.905
- Especially you, E.
- I'm always nice.

08:37.950 --> 08:40.578
- Hi. Hi.
- Hi.

08:40.620 --> 08:43.554
No kiss, no kiss.
I just got an earful from my publicist.

08:43.589 --> 08:45.284
- You, too, huh?
- Good.

08:45.324 --> 08:47.986
- Let's keep you guys separated.
- Ah, you must be E.

08:48.027 --> 08:50.757
I've heard so much about you.
It's nice to finally meet you.

08:50.796 --> 08:52.320
You too.

08:53.332 --> 08:54.765
You look cute.

08:54.800 --> 08:57.064
Really?
I just got out of the gym.

08:57.103 --> 08:59.663
Still cute.

08:59.705 --> 09:02.196
So... how are you guys?

09:02.241 --> 09:03.833
It's been a while.

09:03.876 --> 09:05.309
Everything good, Johnny?

09:05.344 --> 09:07.312
I'm doing an M.O.W.
with Brooke Shields.

09:07.346 --> 09:08.973
Couldn't be better.

09:09.015 --> 09:11.882
Great! What about you, Turtle?

09:11.918 --> 09:13.818
Oh, just working hard,
you know?

09:20.459 --> 09:23.792
Well, how nice is this?
All us together.

09:25.364 --> 09:27.594
Wow, he's good.

09:31.370 --> 09:33.736
All right, she's great.
What do you want me to say?

09:33.773 --> 09:36.264
That's all I want
you to say.

09:36.309 --> 09:38.106
She thinks
you're great, too.

09:38.144 --> 09:40.840
You left her two seconds ago,
you're texting her already?

09:40.880 --> 09:42.279
Nuts, huh?

09:42.315 --> 09:44.545
- Have you ever seen me like this?
- No.

09:44.584 --> 09:47.052
Oh, I'm in deep.

09:47.086 --> 09:49.884
- After one day?
- No, not one day!

09:49.922 --> 09:52.288
We look at it like we've been
dating for five years

09:52.325 --> 09:54.259
with a four-and-half-year break.

09:54.293 --> 09:57.285
What? Like of all people
you don't know that feeling?

09:57.330 --> 09:59.662
No, I know it.
I know it. I still think

09:59.699 --> 10:01.633
- you should cancel the dinner.
- Why?

10:01.667 --> 10:04.830
Because Jerry's Deli is one thing,
all right? The Geisha House

10:04.870 --> 10:07.566
is completely different.
There's gonna be paparazzi there.

10:07.607 --> 10:10.542
I've never let the press control
my life, I'm not gonna start now.

10:10.576 --> 10:12.737
This whole movie
could fall apart. You heard Ari.

10:12.778 --> 10:14.712
What's the real problem here?

10:14.747 --> 10:16.510
Come on, E,
don't hold back!

10:16.549 --> 10:18.540
I think it's a little
much after one day!

10:18.584 --> 10:21.553
This girl dumped you!
She turned down your marriage proposal.

10:21.587 --> 10:23.418
You don't really know
the story.

10:23.456 --> 10:26.482
I know she dumped her fiance three weeks
before the wedding.

10:26.525 --> 10:28.857
Look, she just doesn't
sound stable.

10:28.894 --> 10:30.862
I don't know
about you either lately.

10:30.896 --> 10:32.659
You've known me
almost 25 years.

10:32.698 --> 10:35.724
If you can't get this then maybe
you shouldn't come to the party.

10:35.768 --> 10:38.362
- Maybe I shouldn't.
- No, I don't think you should.

10:38.404 --> 10:41.669
- Fine.
- Okay, everybody. Thanks for coming.

10:41.707 --> 10:44.175
Sorry, we haven't gotten
the scripts to you earlier,

10:44.210 --> 10:46.576
but we were working into
the wee hours making it sing.

10:46.612 --> 10:48.773
- Look at that hair.
- I'm out.

10:48.814 --> 10:52.409
Also, unfortunately,
Joe Mantegna has dropped out.

10:52.451 --> 10:55.648
We're gonna be great.
We're gonna be great.

10:55.688 --> 10:58.020
We're gonna get started
in just a second.

11:01.060 --> 11:02.994
Hey, pal.

11:03.029 --> 11:05.429
- The A.D.s want a word with you.
- About what?

11:14.974 --> 11:16.942
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:16.976 --> 11:18.409
- Johnny.
- Brooke.

11:18.444 --> 11:20.469
I know who you are.

11:20.513 --> 11:23.778
I'm playing Little Rick. We've got
a couple of nice scenes together.

11:23.816 --> 11:26.410
- Yeah, it should be fun.
- Yeah.

11:28.487 --> 11:31.513
- You know what time it is?
- Oh, sorry, no watch.

11:31.557 --> 11:35.220
Yeah, I noticed you
don't wear any jewelry.

11:35.261 --> 11:37.559
No, I never really have.

11:37.596 --> 11:41.054
Yeah, me neither.
No watch, no bracelet, no ring.

11:41.100 --> 11:42.658
Oh.

11:42.702 --> 11:46.194
I just wanted to run something by you
before I pitch it to the director.

11:46.238 --> 11:48.604
Sure. What is it?

11:48.641 --> 11:51.201
- In the comforting scene...
- Yeah.

11:51.243 --> 11:53.939
I thought that maybe
a little kiss might add some pathos.

11:53.979 --> 11:56.675
- A kiss?
- Yeah, nothing crazy.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.650
More in love than lust.

11:58.684 --> 12:00.549
You're playing my brother.

12:02.354 --> 12:04.788
Really? I didn't even
get a full script.

12:04.824 --> 12:08.055
Your brother.
That would be weird.

12:08.094 --> 12:10.085
Yeah.

12:10.129 --> 12:12.188
So, what do you say
we save the kiss?

12:12.231 --> 12:13.960
Okay.

12:13.999 --> 12:16.399
- Okay.
- Rain check it is.

12:17.803 --> 12:19.771
So, your dad is pretty
good with a gun.

12:19.805 --> 12:22.672
- You should see him with a crossbow.
- You serious?

12:22.708 --> 12:24.505
Oh, yeah. He's great
with all weapons.

12:24.543 --> 12:26.636
And he's even better
with his bare knuckles.

12:26.679 --> 12:29.512
Really? Was he on the boxing
team at Oxford or something?

12:29.548 --> 12:32.244
Oxford? No.

12:32.284 --> 12:34.912
You have the wrong idea
about my father.

12:34.954 --> 12:37.149
- He didn't even finish high school.
- Really?

12:37.189 --> 12:39.157
I can't believe that.
He seems so polished.

12:39.191 --> 12:41.386
You don't have
to be afraid of him.

12:41.427 --> 12:45.090
Oh, I know. Why would I be afraid
of a bare-knuckle brawler

12:45.131 --> 12:47.463
who's proficient
in all weapons?

12:47.500 --> 12:50.094
- He likes you.
- Really?

12:50.136 --> 12:52.730
He barely acknowledged me
at skeet shooting.

12:52.772 --> 12:55.240
That's 'cause he knows
that I like you.

12:59.078 --> 13:02.172
- Did he say anything about the party?
- Nope.

13:03.182 --> 13:05.446
Should I say something
to him?

13:05.484 --> 13:08.078
Nope.

13:08.120 --> 13:10.714
All right. He said
you disinvited him.

13:10.756 --> 13:13.020
I didn't disinvite him.

13:13.058 --> 13:14.958
Well, that's what he said.

13:14.994 --> 13:17.929
He called me unstable.

13:19.231 --> 13:22.098
You have been acting
a little unstably, Vin.

13:24.570 --> 13:27.539
You want me
to reinvite him to the party?

13:27.573 --> 13:30.701
Yeah.
No, only if he asks.

13:30.743 --> 13:33.303
Real mature.

13:34.313 --> 13:38.215
Yo. "Blue Lagoon,"
"Endless Love,"

13:38.250 --> 13:40.150
"Muppets Take Manhattan".

13:40.186 --> 13:43.781
- It's gonna be Brooke marathon.
- Great!

13:43.823 --> 13:47.054
All I can tell you is that in the year
I was out of town

13:47.092 --> 13:49.083
Vince slept with almost
all of my friends.

13:49.128 --> 13:52.120
And he never told any of them
he was in love, so maybe he is.

13:52.164 --> 13:54.997
Yeah, well I don't know
why he's lying to me for.

13:55.034 --> 13:58.060
Guys lie to their friends
and tell them that they're not in love.

13:58.103 --> 14:00.230
They don't usually lie
and tell them they are.

14:00.272 --> 14:02.035
That lie they save
for the girls.

14:02.074 --> 14:04.372
He's certainly acting
crazy enough.

14:04.410 --> 14:07.277
Did I tell you he got her a Robert Nitch
painting for her birthday?

14:07.313 --> 14:09.781
- A Robert Neitsch?
- Is it Neitsch?

14:09.815 --> 14:12.409
- Ari said Nitch.
- It's Neitsch.

14:12.451 --> 14:16.114
And, wow!
He bought her a Robert Neitsch?

14:16.155 --> 14:18.020
That's really expensive.

14:18.057 --> 14:21.185
Actually, Ari pulled it off the wall
and gave it to him, but still...

14:21.227 --> 14:23.923
- Oh my God.
- What's so funny?

14:25.564 --> 14:28.397
- It's a fake.
- What do you mean?

14:28.434 --> 14:31.562
I mean, Ari's notorious
for hanging forgeries

14:31.604 --> 14:33.435
in his office
to impress his clients.

14:33.472 --> 14:35.872
- Oh, please tell me you're kidding.
- No.

14:35.908 --> 14:38.069
And I don't know
if it's true,

14:38.110 --> 14:41.170
but my father told me
he changed the numbers

14:41.213 --> 14:43.078
on his wife's Mercedes

14:43.115 --> 14:46.482
so she thinks she's driving around
in a 600, and really it's a five.

14:46.518 --> 14:49.112
- Oh, that's crazy.
- Yeah.

14:49.154 --> 14:52.783
What's crazy is to fight
with your best friend over a girl,

14:52.825 --> 14:55.953
especially a girl you're not
even interested in.

14:57.529 --> 14:59.497
You should go
to the party.

15:00.633 --> 15:02.760
You should go with me.

15:02.801 --> 15:04.564
I would love to.

15:11.377 --> 15:13.174
Looking for an exchange?

15:13.212 --> 15:15.476
Something like that.

15:15.514 --> 15:17.607
I smell trouble.

15:20.319 --> 15:22.287
The unannounced drop-by, huh?

15:22.321 --> 15:24.118
You making a habit
of this, E?

15:24.156 --> 15:25.714
You're not gonna believe this.

15:25.758 --> 15:28.124
Vince got offered $300,000
for this painting.

15:28.160 --> 15:29.787
He wants to sell it.

15:29.828 --> 15:31.955
It was a gift.
Come on, that would be rude.

15:31.997 --> 15:34.625
Yeah, but he's gonna split
the profits with you.

15:34.667 --> 15:36.931
I'm not in the art game
for the profits.

15:36.969 --> 15:38.630
I'm in it for the love
of the work.

15:42.408 --> 15:44.273
I know it's a fake, Ari.

15:44.310 --> 15:47.040
- Cut the bullshit.
- It's a fake?

15:48.147 --> 15:50.012
So, I'm giving out
fake paintings?

15:50.049 --> 15:52.517
Do you want to see
the certificate of authenticity?

15:52.551 --> 15:54.143
Yeah, I do.

15:55.154 --> 15:58.453
Define the term
fake, Eric.

15:58.490 --> 16:02.449
Because three years ago
Vincent Chase sat in this office,

16:02.494 --> 16:06.157
shook my hand and told
me I was his agent. Was that a fake?

16:06.198 --> 16:09.133
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about

16:09.168 --> 16:11.966
the Quentin-motherfucking-
Tarantino meeting

16:12.004 --> 16:13.904
that was set up outside
of this office.

16:13.939 --> 16:17.340
Terrance works inside this office.
He's your boss.

16:17.376 --> 16:19.640
If you guys have a problem,
then you figure it out.

16:19.678 --> 16:23.580
But Vince isn't gonna pass on a Quentin
Tarantino meeting that you couldn't get.

16:23.615 --> 16:25.583
It's a jerkoff general!

16:25.617 --> 16:28.142
My six-year-old could get
that meeting!

16:28.187 --> 16:30.451
Your six-year-old could have
painted this shit, too!

16:30.489 --> 16:33.083
Tarantino is
probably holed up

16:33.125 --> 16:35.753
in a Vegas penthouse
with half a dozen Thai hookers

16:35.794 --> 16:38.695
writing his next script
which no one has seen!

16:38.731 --> 16:41.291
For all we know,
he's probably writing about Wu Tzu Chi

16:41.333 --> 16:43.301
the lesbian empress
of the Ming dynasty!

16:43.335 --> 16:45.565
You want Vince to play
a dictator dyke?

16:45.604 --> 16:47.094
If it's a good role.

16:47.139 --> 16:49.130
Come on, man!

16:49.174 --> 16:50.971
I'm not gonna argue
with you, Ari.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.807
I'm on my way
to an art appraiser.

16:52.845 --> 16:54.813
Care to stop me?

16:54.847 --> 16:57.372
Does Vince know
about this?

16:58.717 --> 17:00.207
No.

17:00.252 --> 17:02.914
But I might tell your wife
she's driving around in a 500.

17:05.089 --> 17:07.183
You better fucking
fix this, Ari.

17:07.226 --> 17:08.954
Before the party.

17:12.464 --> 17:15.126
Hey, buddy, don't mind me.
Just be a minute.

17:23.242 --> 17:24.834
Um, what are you doing?

17:24.877 --> 17:27.436
Hanging some sheetrock.
What does it look like I'm doing?

17:27.479 --> 17:29.811
That's my anniversary present.

17:29.848 --> 17:31.873
No, honey.

17:33.552 --> 17:34.917
This is.

17:36.522 --> 17:38.353
And, action!

17:39.792 --> 17:42.226
Couldn't sleep?

17:45.097 --> 17:47.759
You miss her,
don't you?

17:47.800 --> 17:50.462
Yeah, more than words.

17:53.605 --> 17:55.573
She's in a better place.

17:55.607 --> 17:58.075
It's okay.

17:59.111 --> 18:01.272
It's okay.

18:04.316 --> 18:06.181
It's okay.

18:22.034 --> 18:23.661
He's hard.

18:23.702 --> 18:26.694
- What?
- He is hard.

18:31.610 --> 18:34.602
- Cut! Cut!
- Cutting!

18:42.020 --> 18:44.682
- Why does he have my painting?
- I don't know.

18:44.723 --> 18:46.850
- Well, what did he say?
- He said he'll be here.

18:46.892 --> 18:48.587
- When?
- I don't know, Vince.

18:48.627 --> 18:51.061
This is a '59 Latour

18:51.096 --> 18:53.223
from my private collection.

18:53.265 --> 18:55.825
That ought
to do the trick.

18:55.868 --> 18:58.837
Look, John,
even Hillary Swank

18:58.871 --> 19:01.499
got fired from
"Beverly Hills 90210".

19:01.540 --> 19:03.940
Paul Giamatti was let
go on "Frasier".

19:03.976 --> 19:06.410
I was actually fired
from a TV show

19:06.445 --> 19:08.743
- that will remain nameless.
- "Roswell"?

19:08.780 --> 19:11.374
I never had a job, sorry.

19:11.416 --> 19:14.510
The point is that everyone
gets fired sometimes.

19:14.553 --> 19:17.021
It's what you do afterwards
that counts.

19:17.055 --> 19:20.923
Yeah, but to fire me just because
I wasn't attracted to her.

19:20.959 --> 19:22.950
That's callous.

19:24.897 --> 19:28.025
- Hit me again.
- Bring the Kendall Jackson.

19:28.066 --> 19:29.658
Cork the '59.

19:31.069 --> 19:34.368
Well, Vince,
enjoy the rest of the evening.

19:34.406 --> 19:37.432
I have to get home
to my 18-month-old son Beckett.

19:37.476 --> 19:40.809
He has a happy knack
of waking me at 4:30 in the morning.

19:40.846 --> 19:43.144
- Happy birthday, darling.
- Thank you.

19:43.182 --> 19:46.015
- Thank you, Terrance.
- Hey, cheer up.

19:46.051 --> 19:48.110
- Thank you, Terrance.
- Good night.

19:48.153 --> 19:50.883
Guess it just wasn't
meant to be, Drama.

19:50.923 --> 19:53.414
- Sorry, Johnny.
- Vin.

19:54.960 --> 19:56.825
Well, look what
we have here.

19:56.862 --> 19:59.160
We were about to start
hanging signs on trees.

19:59.198 --> 20:02.031
"Miniature Irish Setter.
Answers to the name of E".

20:02.067 --> 20:05.161
I'm sorry, guys.
It's totally my fault.

20:05.204 --> 20:07.934
I was having a major
fashion disaster.

20:07.973 --> 20:10.635
- Happy birthday, sweetie!
- Thank you.

20:10.676 --> 20:14.237
- You two know each other?
- Yeah, from Barry's Bootcamp.

20:14.279 --> 20:16.144
Uh, let's get a drink.

20:16.181 --> 20:18.046
Yeah, let's do that.

20:19.318 --> 20:21.252
I thought you sold it
and moved to Mexico.

20:21.286 --> 20:23.015
I just had it detailed.

20:24.756 --> 20:26.485
So, are you gonna stay
for dinner?

20:26.525 --> 20:28.720
Yeah, I'm staying
for dinner.

20:35.534 --> 20:37.525
Open mine next.
Open mine next.

20:37.569 --> 20:40.970
I feel so bad. You guys did not have
to get me gifts.

20:41.006 --> 20:43.804
Oh, we wanted to.
Maybe you'll wanna get us gifts

20:43.842 --> 20:47.676
when our birthdays roll around,
say August 6th?

20:47.713 --> 20:50.910
"Viking Quest:
The Complete Series".

20:50.949 --> 20:52.814
That's from both of us.

20:52.851 --> 20:54.682
Thank you. Cool!

20:54.720 --> 20:57.188
- I'll sign that for you if you want.
- Me too.

20:57.222 --> 20:59.884
All right, my turn.

20:59.925 --> 21:02.587
I've been wondering
what that was all night.

21:02.628 --> 21:06.155
Hopefully this will make up for the last
birthday we spent together.

21:06.198 --> 21:09.190
Unless you ran her dog over,
I'm guessing it might.

21:09.234 --> 21:11.395
Oh my God.

21:12.404 --> 21:14.099
That's real too.

21:16.675 --> 21:18.734
Vince, you are crazy.

21:18.777 --> 21:21.075
I can't believe
that you did this.

21:21.113 --> 21:22.910
The second I saw it
I knew you had to have it.

21:22.948 --> 21:25.178
How did you remember
that I love Neitsch?

21:25.217 --> 21:28.152
I remember everything about you.
And it's Nitch.

21:28.186 --> 21:29.881
No, it's not.

21:31.089 --> 21:33.387
It's Neitsch.

21:33.425 --> 21:35.689
You guys, I...

21:36.962 --> 21:39.021
I just... I really
want to thank you

21:39.064 --> 21:41.191
so much for being
a part of tonight.

21:41.233 --> 21:44.066
I really forgot what
a family you guys are.
