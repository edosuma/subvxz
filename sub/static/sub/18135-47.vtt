All the day's headlines
brought to you in luxurious
sepia tone!

The March of War!

00:29.963 --> 00:33.267
The Kasnian Peoples Republic
continues its invasion
of the West,

00:33.301 --> 00:36.404
thanks to their new weapon,
the Superman.

00:36.437 --> 00:38.539
No one but Kasnia
knows where he's from

00:38.572 --> 00:42.143
or how he can possess such
strength and terrible might.

00:42.176 --> 00:44.445
Does anyone have
the power to stop him?

00:44.478 --> 00:48.249
Or will more cities fall to
the conquering red menace?

00:48.282 --> 00:49.383
And in entertainment,

00:49.417 --> 00:52.286
Kara Zor-El continues to
conquer our hearts.

00:52.320 --> 00:56.824
The last survivor of Krypton
and star of TV's most-watched
reality show

00:56.857 --> 00:58.526
can melt steel with a glance.

00:58.559 --> 01:00.828
But can she ever
find true love?

Hey, now, wait just a second.

If these super folks join
forces and use their powers
in league

01:10.838 --> 01:12.406

01:12.440 --> 01:15.743
(LAUGHS) Uh, but of course
that's not the world
we live in.

That's so Kara.

01:22.483 --> 01:26.187
People don't appreciate just
how much I bust my butt.

01:26.220 --> 01:28.689
It's not easy to produce
a network show,

01:28.722 --> 01:30.291
market a skin care line,

01:30.324 --> 01:32.626
update my chat
every five minutes,

01:32.660 --> 01:35.563
and look supes amazing.

01:35.596 --> 01:38.899
Still, I feel like
I could do more...

01:38.932 --> 01:40.601
For people.

01:40.634 --> 01:41.735
Maybe.

01:41.769 --> 01:44.172

Supergirl?

01:55.616 --> 01:57.485
That sounds so familiar.

01:57.518 --> 02:01.255
Out of my way! High-powered
agent coming through.

02:01.289 --> 02:03.891
Kara, doll,
what's the hold-up?

02:03.924 --> 02:06.294
Your public awaits.

02:06.327 --> 02:09.563
I feel like I need to...

02:09.597 --> 02:10.731
Help.

02:10.764 --> 02:12.900
Help? What does help get you?

02:12.933 --> 02:14.902
Nothing! What does it get me?

02:14.935 --> 02:16.770
20% of nothing.

02:16.804 --> 02:19.173
Help, shmelp!

02:19.207 --> 02:20.408
You're right, Morty.

02:20.441 --> 02:22.376
I'm not gonna let
anything spoil this.

02:22.410 --> 02:24.545
It all belongs to me.

02:28.482 --> 02:31.151
This all belong to Kasnia.

What was that?

02:37.825 --> 02:40.228
(LAUGHS) The competition.

02:40.261 --> 02:43.631
He ruined my premiere.

02:43.664 --> 02:44.498
Win some, lose some.

02:44.532 --> 02:47.535
It's not like you can
do something.

02:47.568 --> 02:49.337
Let's go!

02:49.370 --> 02:51.405
Oh, I can do something.

02:51.439 --> 02:53.407
I can teach that Kasnian creep

02:53.441 --> 02:55.709
to stay out of my spotlight.

02:55.743 --> 02:56.910
Ha!

02:56.944 --> 02:58.312
That's my girl!

02:58.346 --> 03:01.749
Go give Comrade Buzzkill
the old one-two.

03:01.782 --> 03:03.384
I'm right behind you.

04:09.650 --> 04:11.619
Ow! Watch it!

04:11.652 --> 04:13.321
Oops! Oh, sorry, little buddy.

04:13.354 --> 04:15.389
I'm Booster Gold,
time traveler.

04:15.956 --> 04:18.326
Who cares?

04:18.359 --> 04:20.060
(LAUGHS) I like you.

04:20.093 --> 04:21.862
Well, stop it.

04:21.895 --> 04:25.999
So, I was just outside
the space-time continuum
in my Booster cave...

04:26.033 --> 04:27.468
It's not really a cave,

04:27.501 --> 04:29.803
I just call it that
'cause of the smell.

04:29.837 --> 04:31.439
I wasn't gone that long

04:31.472 --> 04:34.308
but now Superman and Supergirl
are dressed all weird

04:34.342 --> 04:35.776
and fighting each other.

04:35.809 --> 04:37.578
You don't say.

04:40.948 --> 04:42.950
I do say!

04:42.983 --> 04:44.852
Normally, when this kind of
thing happens it's because
I went back in time

04:44.885 --> 04:46.053
and swallowed a butterfly.

04:46.086 --> 04:48.522
But this time,
I knows it wasn't me.

04:48.956 --> 04:50.524
How?

04:50.558 --> 04:51.859
Because I switched
to caterpillars.

04:51.892 --> 04:53.427
Anyways, the point is,

04:53.461 --> 04:55.663
I didn't cause this.

04:55.696 --> 04:57.064
Hey, that's not your car,
is it?

04:57.097 --> 04:58.432

-Why are you fighting
each other?
-(PHONE RINGING)

05:08.041 --> 05:09.910
Also, why is
my phone telling me

05:09.943 --> 05:12.946
that Justice League is now
a semi-pro bowling team
out of Fresno?

05:12.980 --> 05:14.348
(GRUNTING)

05:16.717 --> 05:18.386
Superman, what are you doing?

05:18.419 --> 05:19.687
That's Supergirl!

05:19.720 --> 05:21.889
Your cousin who hasn't
gone out with me yet.

05:21.922 --> 05:24.392
Strong lady is cousin?

05:24.425 --> 05:26.093
Yes, from Krypton.

05:26.126 --> 05:28.429
By way of Kansas.

05:28.462 --> 05:30.631
Is this not ringing
a bell for you?

05:30.998 --> 05:32.566
Kansas?

05:38.839 --> 05:40.841
We've got to get close enough
to reverse the current.

Follow my lead, cuz.

05:42.009 --> 05:43.377
Right behind you.

06:00.594 --> 06:04.131
(SIGHS) Is it just me, or
are the twisters around here
are getting stronger?

-(MOOING)
-Maybe you're just slowing
down in your old age.

06:06.700 --> 06:09.002
You know, technically,
you're the older cousin.

06:09.036 --> 06:10.438
(SNIFFS) Hang on.

06:10.471 --> 06:12.473
(SNIFFS) Blueberry pie?

06:12.506 --> 06:13.741
Ma Kent's blueberry pie.

06:13.774 --> 06:16.009
Best in the universe.
You wanna...

06:16.043 --> 06:17.044
Oh, it's on.

06:17.077 --> 06:18.879
(MOOING)

06:18.912 --> 06:21.649

dairy and I will be right
there.

Pardon me.

06:29.557 --> 06:32.493
Mmm. So many calories.

06:32.526 --> 06:34.528
But so worth it.

06:37.565 --> 06:39.433
You ever think about,

06:39.467 --> 06:41.502
how different life would be
if we weren't raised in
Smallville?

06:41.535 --> 06:43.971
You know, I think that
no matter where they grow up,
deep down,

06:44.004 --> 06:46.106
everyone has
a little Smallville in them.

06:46.139 --> 06:48.676
-Super corny, but,
I'll second that.
-(MUSIC PLAYING)

06:48.709 --> 06:50.177
Hey, turn it up.
I love this one.

06:50.210 --> 06:51.812
-Turn what up?
-The TV.

06:51.845 --> 06:54.582
Ma doesn't have a TV
in the house, let alone
on the porch.

06:54.615 --> 06:55.883
What? What are you...

Fine. I'll do it.

a fifth dimension

07:01.254 --> 07:05.659

to you backwards hicks.

07:05.693 --> 07:08.028
It's a world between
day and night.

07:08.061 --> 07:11.732

You call that light?

07:11.765 --> 07:14.635
MAN: Nestled between the truth
and what I think

07:14.668 --> 07:16.704
is generally more fun.

07:16.737 --> 07:19.072
It's an area which we call...

07:19.106 --> 07:21.709
The MXY Zone.

07:24.578 --> 07:26.747
-Is that...
-Mr. Mxyzptlk.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.081
You've got to be kidding me.

07:28.115 --> 07:30.250
Submitted for your annoyance.

07:30.283 --> 07:32.119
Nature versus nurture.

07:32.152 --> 07:34.555
Two Smallville goodie-goodies

who think their lives
would be the same

07:36.857 --> 07:40.093
no matter how or where
they grew up.

07:40.127 --> 07:41.194
That's great, Mxy.

07:41.228 --> 07:43.030
Now, why don't we...

07:43.063 --> 07:44.798
Pipe down, Super Stooge!

07:44.832 --> 07:48.536
But what if a simple twist
of fate sent one cousin

07:48.569 --> 07:51.038
not to peace-loving Kansas,

07:51.071 --> 07:53.541
but across the ocean to...

07:53.574 --> 07:54.908
I don't know!

(SNAPS FINGERS)

07:59.980 --> 08:00.981
Uh-oh.

08:01.014 --> 08:02.716
And sent the other to...

08:02.750 --> 08:04.585
(LAUGHS) Let's see.

08:04.618 --> 08:07.988
A more shallow pool.

08:08.021 --> 08:11.992
Mxy, I swear I will make you
say your name backwards so...

08:12.025 --> 08:15.262
Ha! This I gotta see!

08:15.295 --> 08:17.965

08:17.998 --> 08:21.268

annoying imp trick?

No, it actually...
Wait, agent?

08:31.144 --> 08:32.546
You!

08:32.580 --> 08:34.514
Never told me you were
an agent.

08:36.950 --> 08:38.719
So considering
it's named after you and all,

08:38.752 --> 08:40.821
you think I can get a spot
on that Mxy Zone show?

08:40.854 --> 08:42.823
That thing sounds terrif.

08:43.356 --> 08:45.158
Golden Oaf is right.

08:45.192 --> 08:47.595
Agent is Mxyzptlk.

08:47.628 --> 08:49.597
-A what?
-This is my agent Morty.

08:49.630 --> 08:51.665
He made me the person
I am today.

08:51.699 --> 08:54.067
Exactly. It is imp in disguise

08:54.101 --> 08:55.703
who made us this way.

08:55.736 --> 08:57.771
Even this simple clown
could see through.

08:57.805 --> 09:00.040
Oh, clown? Where?

09:00.073 --> 09:05.045
Fine! You outsmarted me
this time, Booster Gold.

09:05.078 --> 09:08.348
But I promise you
it will not happen again!

09:08.381 --> 09:11.652
-Sorry, what? I was still
looking for the clown.

09:22.229 --> 09:24.732
What he made us do.

09:24.765 --> 09:26.934
How could you?
He was only trying to help.

09:26.967 --> 09:29.336
You're better off without him.
Trust me.

09:29.369 --> 09:31.939
Now! Let's reset this reality

09:31.972 --> 09:35.208
and get you two
self-righteous bumpkins

back at each other's throats.

09:55.896 --> 09:58.632
I make him say his
own name backwards.

we vanish annoying imp

we weren't ourselves...

I would never, I...

Well, I never could have,
um...

10:28.261 --> 10:29.697
I love you too.
