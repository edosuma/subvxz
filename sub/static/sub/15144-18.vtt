07:10.917 --> 07:11.917
- And Xander.

07:11.959 --> 07:13.875
And Callie and Tessa.

07:13.917 --> 07:15.291
- Everyone knows us!

07:15.333 --> 07:16.750
- This was a terrible plan.

07:16.792 --> 07:18.125
- All right, just calm down.

07:18.166 --> 07:19.417
We don't want to draw attention

07:18.166 --> 07:19.417
to ourselves.

07:19.458 --> 07:22.250
- Six tickets to

07:19.458 --> 07:22.250
"Triassic Jungle."

07:22.291 --> 07:25.208
Can I get a Harper family

07:22.291 --> 07:25.208
movie night?

07:25.250 --> 07:28.291
[blows horn]

07:28.333 --> 07:29.875
- She brought the horn.

07:29.917 --> 07:32.041
- We got to get them in the

07:29.917 --> 07:32.041
theater before she blows again.

07:32.083 --> 07:34.125
- Oh.

07:34.166 --> 07:35.875
Hey, Mom, the theater's

07:34.166 --> 07:35.875
filling up.

07:35.917 --> 07:37.750
We should probably get in there.

07:37.792 --> 07:39.000
- Come on, Dad.

07:39.041 --> 07:40.417
- But I'm in line

07:39.041 --> 07:40.417
for the Popcornado.

07:40.458 --> 07:42.333
- If we don't hurry up,

07:40.458 --> 07:42.333
all the good seats will be gone.

07:42.375 --> 07:44.458
- And you know how

07:42.375 --> 07:44.458
you hate sitting in the back of

07:42.375 --> 07:44.458
the theater.

07:44.500 --> 07:46.208
- And then you get all whiney.

07:46.250 --> 07:47.750
- The kids are right, Tom.

07:47.792 --> 07:49.709
You do get a little whiney when

07:47.792 --> 07:49.709
you don't get what you want.

07:49.750 --> 07:51.583
- But we got a half hour

07:49.750 --> 07:51.583
till the movie starts.

07:51.625 --> 07:53.917
I want to go into

07:51.625 --> 07:53.917
the Popcornado now...

07:53.959 --> 07:57.250
Oh, I see what you mean.

07:57.291 --> 07:59.208
- Tell you what, if you hurry

07:57.291 --> 07:59.208
and get us good seats,

07:59.250 --> 08:01.709
we'll save your spot

07:59.250 --> 08:01.709
in the Popcornado line.

08:01.750 --> 08:03.458
- Here, take our coats

08:01.750 --> 08:03.458
and save our seats.

08:03.500 --> 08:06.250
- Oh. Oh.

08:03.500 --> 08:06.250
Okay.

08:06.291 --> 08:07.542
- All right now, run along now,

08:07.583 --> 08:09.041
last one to the theater's

08:07.583 --> 08:09.041
a rotten egg.

08:09.083 --> 08:10.500
- We're adults.

08:10.542 --> 08:13.834
We don't care about being

08:10.542 --> 08:13.834
the rotten egg, right, Anne?

08:13.875 --> 08:16.834
I'm always the rotten egg.

08:16.875 --> 08:19.959
- Okay, as long as they're

08:16.875 --> 08:19.959
in there and we're out here,

08:20.000 --> 08:22.250
we're good.

08:22.291 --> 08:24.125
- Not good.

08:22.291 --> 08:24.125
Mack is here.

08:24.166 --> 08:25.750
- The whole school's here.

08:25.792 --> 08:29.542
- Wait, is anybody else mad that

08:25.792 --> 08:29.542
none of these people called us?

08:29.583 --> 08:30.750
- I can't let Mack see me.

08:30.792 --> 08:32.041
He'll know I lied.

08:32.083 --> 08:33.709
Here, I'm going to go

08:32.083 --> 08:33.709
into our theater.

08:33.750 --> 08:37.083
You guys keep an eye on him and

08:33.750 --> 08:37.083
text me if he's heading my way.

08:41.083 --> 08:42.917
- Okay, quick quaddle.

08:42.959 --> 08:46.125
What's the best way to follow

08:42.959 --> 08:46.125
Mack without him seeing us?

08:46.166 --> 08:48.875
- You guys having

08:46.166 --> 08:48.875
a secret conversation?

08:48.917 --> 08:50.458
- Uh, no.

08:50.500 --> 08:53.000
We're not having

08:50.500 --> 08:53.000
a secret conversation.

08:53.041 --> 08:55.291
The more the merrier, buddy.

08:55.333 --> 08:57.542
- Well, you see,

08:55.333 --> 08:57.542
cool-mandment number three says

08:57.583 --> 08:59.709
to always trust your gut,

08:57.583 --> 08:59.709
and right now,

08:59.750 --> 09:02.041
my gut's telling me you guys

08:59.750 --> 09:02.041
are up to something uncool.

09:02.083 --> 09:04.333
- No, this is just how we talk.

09:04.375 --> 09:05.792
- Anyway, we have to get going.

09:05.834 --> 09:07.166
- Why?

09:07.208 --> 09:08.834
You're not here with

09:07.208 --> 09:08.834
your parents, are you?

09:08.875 --> 09:10.834
- What?

09:08.875 --> 09:10.834
- No way.

09:10.875 --> 09:12.375
- Parents are for kids.

09:12.417 --> 09:14.208
We're just chilling

09:12.417 --> 09:14.208
in the lobby.

09:14.250 --> 09:15.792
- Trying to decide

09:14.250 --> 09:15.792
which video games to play

09:15.834 --> 09:18.667
to attract more sweet,

09:15.834 --> 09:18.667
parentless honeys.

09:18.709 --> 09:21.959
- The answer's simple:

09:18.709 --> 09:21.959
whatever game Moses is playing.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.375
Let's go.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.375
[clicks tongue]

09:27.834 --> 09:29.792
- [sighs]

09:29.834 --> 09:31.834
- Check it out, Anne.

09:29.834 --> 09:31.834
They have a lobby cam.

09:31.875 --> 09:33.583
Oh.

09:33.625 --> 09:35.166
Oh, this is--

09:35.208 --> 09:37.417
Look at this amateur

09:35.208 --> 09:37.417
in the Popcornado.

09:37.458 --> 09:39.125
His technique is terrible.

09:39.166 --> 09:41.083
He should be using his mouth,

09:39.166 --> 09:41.083
like this.

09:41.125 --> 09:42.250
You gotta...

09:42.291 --> 09:44.166
- No, honey, don't.

09:42.291 --> 09:44.166
Please, honey.

09:44.208 --> 09:45.625
Oh, excuse me.

09:44.208 --> 09:45.625
I'm sorry.

09:45.667 --> 09:48.166
Those seats are taken.

09:45.667 --> 09:48.166
Yeah.

09:56.333 --> 09:59.709
- You're supposed to be saving

09:56.333 --> 09:59.709
my spot in the Popcornado line.

09:59.750 --> 10:01.333
- Oh, don't worry.

09:59.750 --> 10:01.333
The boys are saving it.

10:01.375 --> 10:02.917
- Really?

10:02.959 --> 10:06.667
Because it looks like

10:02.959 --> 10:06.667
they're playing video games.

10:06.709 --> 10:08.792
- Which we both know

10:08.834 --> 10:11.667
is not what they're

10:08.834 --> 10:11.667
supposed to be doing.

10:11.709 --> 10:13.709
Let me go take care of this.

10:11.709 --> 10:13.709
- Mm.

10:22.583 --> 10:24.333
- I give you guys one job.

10:24.375 --> 10:26.166
And by the way,

10:24.375 --> 10:26.166
Mom and Dad can totally

10:26.208 --> 10:28.875
see you...

10:28.917 --> 10:31.166
later.

10:31.208 --> 10:34.792
'Cause they're certainly

10:31.208 --> 10:34.792
not here with us now.

10:34.834 --> 10:37.500
- What's going on?

10:34.834 --> 10:37.500
You guys are all acting weird.

10:37.542 --> 10:40.750
And Moses got a noses

10:37.542 --> 10:40.750
for that kind of thing.

10:40.792 --> 10:42.542
- This is how we always act.

10:42.583 --> 10:46.709
You got to remember, we're not

10:42.583 --> 10:46.709
nearly as cool as you.

10:46.750 --> 10:48.291
- Speaking of things

10:46.750 --> 10:48.291
that are not cool,

10:48.333 --> 10:52.875
I just saw Mya and Gerald

10:48.333 --> 10:52.875
Dinkler with carrot sticks.

10:52.917 --> 10:55.875
- [gasps]

10:52.917 --> 10:55.875
- Healthy snacks at the movies?

10:55.917 --> 10:58.834
Moses opposes.

10:59.500 --> 11:00.834
- Where's Mack?

11:00.875 --> 11:03.166
You guys were supposed to be

11:00.875 --> 11:03.166
keeping an eye on him.

11:03.208 --> 11:05.625
- He's right there.

11:05.667 --> 11:08.750
You're welcome.

11:08.792 --> 11:12.291
- Wait, he's seeing

11:08.792 --> 11:12.291
"Hungry Wars" without me?

11:12.333 --> 11:13.834
- Well, if it makes you

11:12.333 --> 11:13.834
feel any better,

11:13.875 --> 11:15.417
I don't think he saw you.

11:15.458 --> 11:18.500
- It doesn't make me

11:15.458 --> 11:18.500
feel any better.

11:18.542 --> 11:20.542
He broke our movie buddy pact.

11:20.583 --> 11:21.709
[upbeat music]

11:24.667 --> 11:27.625
[upbeat music]

11:27.667 --> 11:29.041
- Mack and I had a movie pact.

11:29.083 --> 11:30.208
- Here we go with

11:29.083 --> 11:30.208
the pacing again.

11:30.250 --> 11:32.583
- We were supposed to be

11:30.250 --> 11:32.583
movie buddies.

11:32.625 --> 11:35.917
- In his defense, you do have

11:32.625 --> 11:35.917
a terrible text-cough.

11:35.959 --> 11:38.250
- And he's not seeing it

11:35.959 --> 11:38.250
at your usual theater

11:38.291 --> 11:40.250
where you might have found out

11:38.291 --> 11:40.250
and gotten upset.

11:40.291 --> 11:42.583
That's pretty considerate.

11:42.625 --> 11:44.208
- And you did lie to him first.

11:44.250 --> 11:47.542
So I'm kind of Team Mack here.

11:47.583 --> 11:50.083
- I lied to protect

11:47.583 --> 11:50.083
our movie pact.

11:50.125 --> 11:51.709
He broke it.

11:51.750 --> 11:54.208
You know what?

11:51.750 --> 11:54.208
I'm going in.

11:54.250 --> 11:55.917
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:55.959 --> 11:58.000
You don't want to face him

11:55.959 --> 11:58.000
when you're this mad.

11:58.041 --> 12:00.875
- Yeah.

11:58.041 --> 12:00.875
Pace it off, mama.

12:00.917 --> 12:03.000
- No.

12:00.917 --> 12:03.000
I'm going to call him.

12:03.041 --> 12:05.208
- That's a worse idea.

12:05.250 --> 12:09.000
You know things don't

12:05.250 --> 12:09.000
go well when you call angry.

12:09.041 --> 12:11.792
- I believe the term

12:09.041 --> 12:11.792
is Dawn-dialing.

12:11.834 --> 12:15.959
- Yeah, remember last Christmas

12:11.834 --> 12:15.959
when Aunt Gilda gave you that

12:11.834 --> 12:15.959
juggling lesson as a gift?

12:16.000 --> 12:19.041
And you thanked her with

12:16.000 --> 12:19.041
a big, fat Dawn-dial.

12:19.083 --> 12:21.458
- She still won't take

12:19.083 --> 12:21.458
any of our calls.

12:21.500 --> 12:23.792
- Who gives somebody one lesson?

12:23.834 --> 12:25.709
You can't learn to juggle

12:23.834 --> 12:25.709
in 45 minutes.

12:25.750 --> 12:28.333
It can't be done.

12:28.375 --> 12:29.458
- Just give me the phone, Dawn.

12:29.500 --> 12:31.917
- Guys, don't worry.

12:31.959 --> 12:35.542
This is not

12:31.959 --> 12:35.542
an Aunt Gilda situation.

12:35.583 --> 12:36.917
Voicemail.

12:36.959 --> 12:38.500
I'm just going to express

12:36.959 --> 12:38.500
my disappointment

12:38.542 --> 12:41.333
and ask him to call me later

12:38.542 --> 12:41.333
to discuss it.

12:41.375 --> 12:42.333
Hey, Mack.

12:41.375 --> 12:42.333
It's Dawn.

12:42.375 --> 12:43.792
How's it going...

12:43.834 --> 12:46.458
is what I would have said

12:43.834 --> 12:46.458
if I wasn't so mad.

12:46.500 --> 12:48.834
I can't believe you went

12:46.500 --> 12:48.834
to "Hungry Wars" without me.

12:48.875 --> 12:50.417
- Should have taken the phone.

12:50.458 --> 12:52.709
- That's right, Mr.

12:50.458 --> 12:52.709
I'm-gonna-go-to-Fort-Collins-

12:52.750 --> 12:54.375
so-nobody-will-see-me.

12:54.417 --> 12:56.875
I'm at the Brister Six

12:54.417 --> 12:56.875
with my parents.

12:56.917 --> 12:58.917
- At least she didn't say us.

12:56.917 --> 12:58.917
- And my brothers.

12:58.959 --> 13:00.750
- Hey, we made the message.

13:00.792 --> 13:02.458
- And I just saw you

13:00.792 --> 13:02.458
go into the movie

13:02.500 --> 13:05.041
you and I made a pact

13:02.500 --> 13:05.041
to see together.

13:05.083 --> 13:07.500
But I guess our friendship

13:05.083 --> 13:07.500
doesn't mean anything to you,

13:07.542 --> 13:08.750
so guess what, mister?

13:08.792 --> 13:10.625
You're no longer my movie buddy.

13:10.667 --> 13:12.291
You are my movie...

13:12.333 --> 13:13.291
enemy.

13:13.333 --> 13:16.250
Dawn out.

13:19.834 --> 13:21.417
What have I done?

13:21.458 --> 13:24.291
- Classic Dawn-dial.

13:24.333 --> 13:26.417
- That she dragged us into.

13:26.458 --> 13:28.125
- Yeah, now everyone's

13:26.458 --> 13:28.125
going to know we're here

13:28.166 --> 13:29.792
with our parents, too.

13:29.834 --> 13:32.250
We're doomed.

13:29.834 --> 13:32.250
Thanks a lot, Dawn.

13:32.291 --> 13:33.542
- Don't blame me.

13:33.583 --> 13:35.792
You guys should have never

13:33.583 --> 13:35.792
let me Dawn-dial.

13:35.834 --> 13:37.166
You know what?

13:37.208 --> 13:38.834
I'm going to call

13:37.208 --> 13:38.834
all three of you right now

13:38.875 --> 13:40.792
and tell you how angry I am.

13:40.834 --> 13:43.625
- Dawn, stop.

13:43.667 --> 13:46.333
- Oh, Mack's coming back out.

13:48.375 --> 13:50.041
- Hey, I went into

13:48.375 --> 13:50.041
the wrong theater.

13:50.083 --> 13:51.959
Um, I'm not seeing

13:50.083 --> 13:51.959

21:13.917 --> 21:14.875
- Come on, Mom.

21:14.917 --> 21:18.542
You're making me look so uncool.

[sighs]

21:20.125 --> 21:23.333
- Stop that.

21:20.125 --> 21:23.333
- Ugh.

21:23.375 --> 21:25.000
- Norman.

21:25.041 --> 21:26.625
- Okay, well,

21:25.041 --> 21:26.625
now that that's settled,

21:26.667 --> 21:27.750
why don't we grab our seats?

21:27.792 --> 21:29.166
The movie's about to start.

21:32.417 --> 21:34.625
- Animals.

21:38.667 --> 21:42.375
- Oh, then why don't we all see

21:38.667 --> 21:42.375
if we can get into "Hungry

21:38.667 --> 21:42.375
Wars"?

21:42.417 --> 21:46.208
- Sounds good, movie buddy.

21:46.250 --> 21:48.458
- There's just one thing

21:46.250 --> 21:48.458
we need to do first.

21:48.500 --> 21:50.375
- Yeah.

21:50.417 --> 21:53.083
[cheers and applause]

21:55.875 --> 21:57.667
- That's our Dad.

21:57.709 --> 22:01.667

22:01.709 --> 22:05.041
