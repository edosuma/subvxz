??

00:32.500 --> 00:34.500
???

00:34.550 --> 00:36.590
'cause I'm too old to be adopted,

00:36.630 --> 00:38.760
and you're too pretty to be in prison.

00:38.790 --> 00:40.660
You should talk to some other couples.

00:40.700 --> 00:42.950
- Why?
- We almost adopted once before.

00:42.990 --> 00:46.380
And then they found out that
the children were with a gay couple.

00:46.410 --> 00:47.920
And they changed their mind.

00:47.950 --> 00:49.540
We'de to meet Ricky.

00:49.570 --> 00:51.280
Truth is,it may not be
the best thing for him

00:51.330 --> 00:52.760
if you two are together.

00:52.810 --> 00:55.330
That's a decision
he's gonna have to make himself.

00:56.080 --> 00:57.510
Okay.

01:05.880 --> 01:08.090
I'm sorry,did you say your father?

01:08.130 --> 01:09.780
Your biological father?

01:09.820 --> 01:11.830
Yeah,but he's gone now.

01:11.870 --> 01:14.080
And when he was here,
you didn't need to call me?

01:14.120 --> 01:15.170
You didn't wanna talk to me?

01:15.210 --> 01:16.620
I was too busy to call you.

01:16.670 --> 01:18.250
And besides,I was afraid
you were still upset

01:18.290 --> 01:19.930
about the whole Lauren thing.

01:19.960 --> 01:21.860
And believe me,
I don't like you upset.

01:21.890 --> 01:23.570
Well,I'm a little upset now.

01:23.610 --> 01:25.360
Your abusive father gets out of prison,

01:25.400 --> 01:27.900
every conversation we have ever had

01:27.940 --> 01:30.240
can be traced back to this guy,

01:30.280 --> 01:31.920
and you don't feel
the need to drop by here

01:31.960 --> 01:33.370
and let me know what's going on?

01:33.400 --> 01:35.100
Hey,I'm here,aren't I?

01:35.130 --> 01:36.730
You saw him,you talked to him?

01:36.780 --> 01:38.320
We didn't exactly talk.

01:38.350 --> 01:41.050
He cnered me a cCRe
of times in parking lots.

01:41.090 --> 01:43.530
He just wanted to try and
take advantage of the baby.

01:43.580 --> 01:46.550
He thought he could make some
money selling him to a couple.

01:46.610 --> 01:47.780
Not selling him exactly.

01:47.830 --> 01:50.390
Just a finder's fee on an adoption.

01:50.430 --> 01:52.240
Anyway,he's back in the slammer.

01:52.280 --> 01:53.400
For?

01:53.450 --> 01:54.810
Drugs. He got busted.

01:54.840 --> 01:56.210
I see.

01:57.280 --> 02:00.610
your dad is trafficking your
baby and he gets busted for drugs

02:00.650 --> 02:03.470
and that doesn't send
you running back in here.

02:03.510 --> 02:05.370
,what has?

02:05.400 --> 02:07.630
Oh,of course.

02:07.660 --> 02:09.410
You're in love again.

02:09.460 --> 02:11.510
- Who is it this time?
- You were right.

02:11.540 --> 02:14.680
I'm not in love with Grace.
I thought I was,but I'm not.

02:14.720 --> 02:15.662
I mean,I love her,

02:15.697 --> 02:18.790
- but nothe same way  love--
- Adrian?

02:18.840 --> 02:21.060
- No,she's in lovein with her brother.
- Her brother?

02:21.100 --> 02:22.880
Yeah,and you thought I was messed up.

02:22.910 --> 02:25.590
No,no,I don't wanna get sidetracked here.

02:25.960 --> 02:27.170
Who are you in love with?

02:27.200 --> 02:27.910
Amy.

02:27.950 --> 02:29.070
Now it's Amy?

02:29.120 --> 02:31.920
I'm not a careless guy.
I've never been a careless guy.

02:31.950 --> 02:35.710
maybe I wantedI  to get her pregnant.

02:35.750 --> 02:37.650
- Because you love her?
- yeah.

02:37.690 --> 02:39.560
Ricky,Ricky,Ricky.

02:39.610 --> 02:42.720
Why would you wanna do that
to a girl you love?

02:42.760 --> 02:46.160
Does that make sense?
That you tried to get Amy pregnant?

02:46.200 --> 02:47.510
I guess.

02:47.560 --> 02:49.560
Hey,at least it wasn't Lauren,right?

02:49.600 --> 02:51.170
At least.

02:52.130 --> 02:54.960
But what appli to Grace and Adrian

02:55.010 --> 02:57.430
and every other girl
you've been in love with,

02:57.480 --> 02:59.570
applies to Amy:

03:00.240 --> 03:02.920
you are not capable of loving someone

03:02.960 --> 03:06.197
until and unless you love yourself.

03:06.232 --> 03:08.300
That's the thing. I think I do.

03:08.700 --> 03:10.770
What,I'm not allowed to make progress?

03:10.830 --> 03:13.880
Hey,no one would be happier than me.

03:14.200 --> 03:16.860
Tell me,why do you think
you made that kind of progress?

03:16.890 --> 03:20.240
Because I didn't sell my baby
to the highest bidder.

03:20.290 --> 03:22.680
I didn't offer him up
to get rid of my dad.

03:23.030 --> 03:25.880
You know,I realized somehow that...

03:25.910 --> 03:28.030
I'm really not my father

03:28.070 --> 03:30.260
For the first time,I realized it.

03:30.300 --> 03:32.670
I'm not him,and I'm not gonna be him.

03:32.710 --> 03:36.250
That is progress.

03:36.290 --> 03:40.010
I'm happy for you,genuinely happy.

03:40.050 --> 03:41.090
I'm-- I'm proud of you.

03:41.130 --> 03:43.610
And you shouldproudprof yourself.

03:43.670 --> 03:44.920
I kinda am.

03:44.960 --> 03:49.120
"Kinda"? Ricky,this is
a huge breakthrough. Huge.

03:49.160 --> 03:51.560
Tell me more about A Tell me about...

03:51.600 --> 03:52.690
Wait.

03:52.730 --> 03:54.370
You're having a son?

03:54.420 --> 03:55.520
Did I know this?

03:55.560 --> 03:57.120
Well,I just found out.

03:57.170 --> 03:59.490
A son. Nice.

03:59.520 --> 04:02.270
Yeah,but Amy's found a couple

04:02.330 --> 04:04.470
that she thinks would be
good parents for him,

04:04.500 --> 04:06.620
so we're talking about adoption.

04:06.660 --> 04:07.860
How do you feel about that?

04:07.910 --> 04:10.560
I feel that they'd
be good parents,I guess.

04:10.600 --> 04:12.110
My mom knows them.
That's what she says,

04:12.150 --> 04:13.650
that they would be good parents.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.410
Then again maybe Amy and
I would parents,so I'm thinking...

04:20.769 --> 04:22.240
I'll go along with what everyone wants.

04:22.290 --> 04:25.290
I'll meet these guys
and see what happens.

04:25.790 --> 04:27.390
Then after a few weeks,

04:27.430 --> 04:29.550
if it doesn't fall apart
for one reason or another

04:29.580 --> 04:32.170
and it looks like they are
gonna adopt the baby,

04:32.220 --> 04:34.980
then I'll try to pursue
my legal rights and stop them.

04:35.720 --> 04:38.670
I-- I haven't told my mother
that I wanna keep the baby yet,

04:38.740 --> 04:42.970
so I'm thinking when I do,
she'll choose me. She has to.

04:46.060 --> 04:50.780
See,this is that two steps back
I'm always talking about.

04:50.820 --> 04:54.220
One giant leap forward
and two steps back.

04:54.270 --> 04:57.580
Ricky,your mother's not gonna
go along with you if ydeceiving people.

04:57.620 --> 04:59.730
You t lead a couple to believe

04:59.760 --> 05:01.110
you're gonna go along with an adoption

05:01.150 --> 05:03.240
- when you don't intend to.
- Look,I can

05:03.290 --> 05:05.260
if that's the best thing for my son.

05:06.080 --> 05:07.620
If I just have some time with Amy,

05:07.660 --> 05:09.730
so that she gets to know me
a little better,

05:09.770 --> 05:11.560
I mean,then she might come around.

05:11.590 --> 05:14.250
If I say no now,there's no
chance of that happening.

05:14.290 --> 05:16.550
Ricky,you can't.

05:16.590 --> 05:18.860
You can't play with
people's lives like that.

05:18.900 --> 05:21.040
Hey,they may never go
through with it anyway,

05:21.080 --> 05:23.040
and I'm not gonna go
against Amy right now.

05:23.090 --> 05:28.050
Just later when a family has
their hearts set on adopting?

05:28.080 --> 05:29.320
It's early.

05:29.360 --> 05:32.380
I don't know that anyone has
their hearts set on anything.

05:32.680 --> 05:34.180
Other than me.

05:34.230 --> 05:36.440
I have my het set on Amyand our ba

05:36.480 --> 05:37.750
What about,uh...?

05:37.800 --> 05:39.510
What is it,Ben?

05:39.550 --> 05:41.130
Amy still with Ben?

05:41.170 --> 05:43.230
Ben's no match for me.

06:14.700 --> 06:16.070
Where are you going in that getup?

06:16.100 --> 06:17.160
"Getup"?

06:17.200 --> 06:19.220
That's what you call this? A getup?

06:19.770 --> 06:21.520
I'm using my free pass to get out of jail

06:21.560 --> 06:23.100
to do some things I need to do,

06:23.140 --> 06:25.560
not thhE that's any
of your business,Old Man Juergens.

06:26.220 --> 06:27.940
Job interview? Bank of Women?

06:27.970 --> 06:29.660
Don't you think the women
jokes are getting a bit old?

06:29.700 --> 06:32.260
No sense of humor this morning,
must be a case of the nerves.

06:32.290 --> 06:34.100
Yup. It is a job interview.

06:34.140 --> 06:35.570
When are you moving to your own place?

06:35.610 --> 06:36.910
This is my o i.???

06:36.950 --> 06:39.830
The question should be whe am
I moving from my own place?

06:39.870 --> 06:41.170
And the answer is never.

06:41.210 --> 06:43.530
If you're gettin ally one that
requires a suit,maybe you can move.

06:43.570 --> 06:44.710
I don't have any money.

06:44.750 --> 06:47.080
I'm gonna find the money sooner or later.

06:47.860 --> 06:49.870
And can you find something
else to do tonit?

06:49.920 --> 06:52.260
Amy and Ricky are coming ove
to talk to Donovan and Leon.

06:52.290 --> 06:54.180
- I don't think you should be around.
- I won't.

06:54.220 --> 06:56.910
I'll be in my garage waiting
for them to tell me how it went. Ha.

06:56.950 --> 06:58.390
I already talked to Donovan about it.

06:58.430 --> 07:00.560
Amy feels sick.
She's not going to school today.

07:00.620 --> 07:03.100
Sick? Oh,jeez.

07:03.150 --> 07:04.070
What? Is she sick or not?

07:04.100 --> 07:05.460
No,she's not sick.

07:05.510 --> 07:07.030
This is about Ben again.

07:07.060 --> 07:09.650
Every married couple argues.
Take us,for example.

07:09.680 --> 07:11.160
We're not a couple,George.

07:11.190 --> 07:13.550
You'rea guy living in my garage.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.430
And Ben and Amy aren't
a couple anymore either.

07:15.460 --> 07:17.510
????When did this happen?

07:17.540 --> 07:18.350
A week ago.

07:18.380 --> 07:20.670
You haven't noticed that
Amy's been upset?

07:20.710 --> 07:23.620
She's been upset for months. How was
I supposed to know this week was special?

07:23.660 --> 07:24.690
She's your daughter?

07:24.730 --> 07:25.680
Why'd they break up?

07:25.710 --> 07:28.350
The guy married her knowing
she was having another guy's baby.

07:28.400 --> 07:30.240
Something worse happened last week?

07:30.280 --> 07:32.070
I don't think anything happened exactly.

07:32.110 --> 07:33.280
SoETing happened.

07:33.320 --> 07:34.340
I gotta go.

07:34.370 --> 07:36.200
I'm just gonna tell Amy I'm leaving.

07:38.810 --> 07:39.590
Speak.

07:39.640 --> 07:42.500
Ben's just taking a break to
see if she'd rather be with Ricky.

07:42.540 --> 07:43.980
He thinks she likes Ricky.

07:44.020 --> 07:45.150
She doesn't like Ricky.

07:45.180 --> 07:46.206
Maybe,maybe not.

07:46.241 --> 07:48.430
But either way,she had sex with Ricky

07:48.470 --> 07:49.930
and Ben's reading a lot into that.

07:49.960 --> 07:51.790
Maybe she should have sex with Ben.

07:52.740 --> 07:54.320
You're right. Bad idea.

07:54.370 --> 07:57.570
Amy,you can't afford to
take a day off of school.

07:57.910 --> 08:00.550
You're gonna be missing days
when the baby comes.

08:00.590 --> 08:04.180
I can't stand being at school
knowing Ben is there ignoring me.

08:04.210 --> 08:06.000
You and Ben will work things out.

08:06.040 --> 08:07.620
No,we won't.

08:07.680 --> 08:10.390
We can't work things out
if he won't even talk to me.

08:10.440 --> 08:13.240
The worst part is,
I totally understand why.

08:13.280 --> 08:14.420
It's because...

08:14.450 --> 08:17.460
Because my baby is Ricky's baby,

08:17.490 --> 08:19.360
and nothing's gonna change that.

08:19.400 --> 08:22.520
I can't change that.
He might want me to,but I can't.

08:22.550 --> 08:26.310
That's right,and if Ben can't
deal with that,then forget about him.

08:26.350 --> 08:27.380
You deserve better.

08:27.410 --> 08:30.950
I'm a pregnant 15-year-old girl.
I deserve better?

08:30.990 --> 08:32.240
I don't deserve better.

08:32.280 --> 08:33.919
That's enough of that,Amy.

08:33.970 --> 08:35.909
Okay,even if you weren't pregnant,

08:35.950 --> 08:37.929
you and Ben would still
find things to argue about,

08:37.960 --> 08:40.380
because that's what people do
in relationships.

08:40.419 --> 08:42.980
No two people can agree on
everything all of the time.

08:43.030 --> 08:45.140
So there are differences of opinion,

08:45.170 --> 08:48.110
disagreements,arguments. It happens.

08:48.150 --> 08:51.120
Every argument is a chance
to learn something about yourself

08:51.150 --> 08:52.640
and about the other person.

08:52.680 --> 08:54.600
What am I supposed to learn here?

08:54.630 --> 08:58.570
That boys don't like girls
who are pregnant by other boys?

08:59.070 --> 09:00.570
Lesson learned.

09:02.290 --> 09:04.120
I'm probably better off with Ricky.

09:04.170 --> 09:05.480
What?

09:05.520 --> 09:08.290
You are not better off with Ricky.

09:08.330 --> 09:09.690
Oh,Amy...

09:09.730 --> 09:11.170
What? I am.

09:11.200 --> 09:13.340
Let's talk about this later,okay?
I have to go.

09:13.380 --> 09:15.270
t ready for school.

09:15.320 --> 09:17.630
So try to pull yourself together,okay?

09:17.680 --> 09:19.050
I can't.

09:19.090 --> 09:20.740
Try.

09:33.170 --> 09:34.940
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

09:34.980 --> 09:37.500
There's enough stuff in here
for a week in France.

09:37.530 --> 09:38.970
Goodbye,George.

09:43.400 --> 09:45.060
Talk her into going to school.

09:55.540 --> 09:56.970
Hey,I just heard.

09:57.010 --> 09:58.270
Heard what?

09:59.200 --> 10:00.600
About you and Ben.

10:01.480 --> 10:03.930
You know,guys aren't
that great at apologizing.

10:03.970 --> 10:07.710
It's a flaw in their
below-the-waist anatomy.

10:07.730 --> 10:09.830
So I don't know what happened,
I don't need to know.

10:09.860 --> 10:11.640
Why don't you call the guy?
Let him off the hook.

10:11.680 --> 10:14.610
He doesn't wanna be wiOF

10:14.980 --> 10:17.820
???

10:17.850 --> 10:19.330
??

10:19.360 --> 10:20.200
Who wouldn't wanna be with you?

10:20.240 --> 10:22.950
Of course he wants to be with you.
You're beautiful.

10:22.980 --> 10:24.350
I'm a big fat pregnant girl.

10:24.390 --> 10:26.550
So what? You're still beautiful.

10:26.590 --> 10:28.310
- To you maybe.
- Baby.

10:30.750 --> 10:31.840
Hey,you want me to talk to Ben?

10:31.880 --> 10:34.710
No,no,I do not want you to talk to Ben.

10:35.250 --> 10:38.920
You don't like Ricky,do you?
I mean,as a boyfriend?

10:38.950 --> 10:40.950
No,but...

10:40.980 --> 10:41.620
But what?

10:41.650 --> 10:43.170
I think Ricky likes me.

10:43.200 --> 10:46.410
And when someone likes you,
you can't help but likthem back,

10:46.450 --> 10:49.970
especially if your boyfriend/
husband isn't speaking to you.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.070
Have either of you seen Ashley?
I can't find Ashley.

10:53.100 --> 10:54.820
I can't find her and I have to go.

10:54.860 --> 10:56.950
- Can you look for her,please?
- Yeah.

10:56.980 --> 10:58.690
She's probablyalking to school.

10:58.720 --> 11:00.100
I hope.

11:02.930 --> 11:03.820
You gonna be okay?

11:03.850 --> 11:05.580
In a cple of m@@ yeah.

11:05.620 --> 11:08.320
In a couple of months,
all I'll have to deal with

11:08.360 --> 11:09.660
is that I won't have
to deal with the baby

11:09.700 --> 11:11.990
because I'm giving
him to Donovan and Leon.

11:12.020 --> 11:13.610
But I thought that's
what you wanted to do?

11:13.650 --> 11:15.650
I do. I really do.

11:15.930 --> 11:18.020
It's just hard to think about.

11:18.930 --> 11:23.020
Holding him and seeing
his tiny feet and hands

11:23.050 --> 11:25.730
and then just handing
him over to someone else.

11:25.770 --> 11:27.290
You're still gonna
be able to hold him

11:27.330 --> 11:28.950
and his tiny little feet and hands.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.780
We're all goe be ableto see the baby.

11:30.810 --> 11:32.090
I kn

11:32.430 --> 11:33.450
You wanna go to school?

11:33.480 --> 11:34.470
Can I stay home?

11:34.510 --> 11:35.910
Yeah,it's one day,who cares?

11:36.290 --> 11:37.720
Hey,you wanna come
with me to find toey?

11:37.750 --> 11:41.270
wanna go out with my
eyes swollen and my nose red.

11:41.300 --> 11:43.260
Come on. It'll be fun.

11:43.290 --> 11:45.470
When's the last time
you had some real fun?

11:46.490 --> 11:48.180
Please don't say band camp.

11:48.230 --> 11:49.750
I wasn't.

12:00.150 --> 12:02.220
- Skipping school?
- Who wants to know?

12:03.260 --> 12:05.180
I think we goweto the same schoo

12:05.650 --> 12:06.860
My name's Thomas.

12:06.880 --> 12:08.350
I transferred in last year.

12:09.490 --> 12:11.340
I must have made a real impression.

12:11.370 --> 12:13.380
I've been kind of distracted.

12:13.410 --> 12:14.830
My sister's pregnant.

12:14.880 --> 12:16.090
She's 15.

12:16.130 --> 12:17.890
Oh,yeah,I heard about that.

12:18.580 --> 12:20.350
But my dog just died.

12:21.360 --> 12:22.910
She was 17.

12:23.350 --> 12:24.160
You win.

12:24.200 --> 12:25.780
I loved that dog.

12:28.950 --> 12:30.570
What kind of dog was he?

12:31.140 --> 12:32.360
She.

12:32.410 --> 12:34.090
A mutt.

12:34.970 --> 12:36.510
Do you want a cigarette?

12:36.540 --> 12:39.280
Yeah,sure. Why not?

12:40.150 --> 12:41.340
Do you smoke?

12:41.370 --> 12:42.680
No.

12:46.770 --> 12:48.110
She's smoking.

12:50.510 --> 12:51.870
You taking the bus to school?

12:51.890 --> 12:52.850
Yeah.

12:52.880 --> 12:54.060
Okay,then.

12:58.730 --> 13:00.680
- That was my dad.
- Does he smoke?

13:00.720 --> 13:02.620
No,but I can prty muchCFt away with a

13:02.650 --> 13:04.420
because my sister's pregnant.

13:05.410 --> 13:07.910
Then again,I don't really
wanna die from lung cancer.

13:07.950 --> 13:10.150
Oh. Yeah. Good.I don't either.

13:12.350 --> 13:13.940
Do you wanna skip school?

13:13.970 --> 13:16.100
Yeah,for the next four and a half years.

13:16.140 --> 13:17.220
All right,then.

13:17.260 --> 13:19.200
You know I meant skip school with me?

13:19.230 --> 13:20.880
Yeah,I-- I got that.

13:20.920 --> 13:23.010
I'd like to,but I'm waiting for someone.

13:23.040 --> 13:25.490
- Someone special?
- Not special to me.

13:25.520 --> 13:26.790
Good.

13:27.970 --> 13:29.590
Are you going to school later,then?

13:29.620 --> 13:30.850
Probably.

13:30.880 --> 13:32.400
I'll see you there.

13:38.970 --> 13:41.440
You're just gonna leave
Ashley at the bus stop,sE king?

13:41.480 --> 13:43.490
????

13:43.520 --> 13:44.670
She had a cigarette in her hand.

13:44.710 --> 13:45.760
I know my girls.

13:45.790 --> 13:48.470
Do you? Because you probably
thought I'd never have sex.

13:48.520 --> 13:50.220
I didn't think you'd never have sex.

13:50.250 --> 13:52.490
??

13:52.530 --> 13:55.050
and in a committed relationship
and using birth control.

13:55.090 --> 13:57.140
But instead,you@@ad sex at 15 got preg.

13:57.170 --> 14:00.310
Dad,you could ba little mortte,you kno

14:00.360 --> 14:01.580
I'm feeling bad enough.

14:01.630 --> 14:02.880
Hey,stuff happens.

14:02.920 --> 14:04.910
It breaks my heart that this
stuff happened to you,

14:04.960 --> 14:07.410
but some things you can control
and some things you can't.

14:07.460 --> 14:09.880
And don't play that
victim role,it's not very you.

14:09.930 --> 14:11.130
Let's go find Ben.

14:11.180 --> 14:13.340
You just like him
because his dad's rich.

14:14.020 --> 14:15.130
There's no shame in being rich.

14:15.180 --> 14:17.280
And I just like him because he loves you,

14:17.330 --> 14:19.830
even if you are pregnant
by another guy who likes you.

14:20.240 --> 14:22.210
You having a hard time
with the truth? I bet Ben is.

14:22.240 --> 14:23.580
Here's the truth:

14:23.610 --> 14:24.670
I love Ben.

14:24.720 --> 14:26.900
I want to legally marry Ben.

14:26.930 --> 14:27.964
But I had sex with Ricky

14:27.999 --> 14:30.990
and I don'wanna keep having sex
with guy after guy after guy-

14:31.040 --> 14:34.230
I wanted my husband to be the one
and only guy I ever had sex with.

14:34.280 --> 14:35.300
Then how'd this 'dppen,Ames?

14:35.350 --> 14:37.810
I don't know. I had a plan--

14:40.350 --> 14:41.940
Maybe fate just intervened.

14:41.980 --> 14:43.140
Oh,no.

14:43.170 --> 14:44.570
I know what you're thinking.

14:44.600 --> 14:47.540
You think you'll marry Ricky
because you had sex with him.

14:47.590 --> 14:49.630
from making up with Ben?

14:49.670 --> 14:51.130
You had sex with the wrong guy.

14:51.170 --> 14:53.350
And you can't fix this
by marrying the wrong guy.

14:53.380 --> 14:55.690
That won't do anything
hie baby or for you.

14:55.730 --> 14:57.730
Besides,legal or not,
you're already married.

14:57.770 --> 15:00.340
Yeah,good thing that wasn't for real.

15:00.370 --> 15:01.420
I think it was for real.

15:01.480 --> 15:04.400
I think Ben's feelings for
you are for real,even if he is 15.

15:04.440 --> 15:07.440
Maybe even though I love Ben,
I was meant to be  Lth Ricky.

15:07.470 --> 15:09.290
Where'd you get an idea like that?

15:10.220 --> 15:11.850
Have you been talking to Ricky?

15:13.160 --> 15:15.210
You know what might
be more fun than this?

15:15.270 --> 15:16.820
School.

15:25.980 --> 15:28.750
Mom,what makes you think
I need birth control pills?

15:28.780 --> 15:30.460
Do you think I'm having sex?

15:30.490 --> 15:34.140
You left condoms on your
bathroom counter in plain sight.

15:34.180 --> 15:37.000
Not condom,condoms.

15:37.030 --> 15:38.820
A long string of condoms.

15:38.850 --> 15:39.910
Oh,those.

15:39.960 --> 15:42.240
Adrian gave those to me the first
time I went out with Ricky.

15:42.290 --> 15:43.640
Exactly my point.

15:43.680 --> 15:45.120
I'm not using them.

15:45.170 --> 15:45.750
What?

15:45.800 --> 15:47.070
I'm not having sex.

15:47.110 --> 15:49.370
Grace,you know what our beliefs are.

15:49.410 --> 15:51.640
You know we think you should wait,
but if you're having sex--

15:54.630 --> 15:56.330
You're not having sex?

15:56.370 --> 15:57.620
You've never had sex?

15:57.660 --> 15:59.100
No.

16:00.190 --> 16:02.100
But can I still keep the pills?

16:02.740 --> 16:05.810
Uh,I guess you can.

16:05.850 --> 16:06.840
With the understanding--

16:06.890 --> 16:09.680
That if I'm thinking about
having sex,I'll tell you.

16:09.720 --> 16:12.840
Grace,I don't want you to have sex.

16:12.880 --> 16:13.470
I know.

16:13.520 --> 16:16.090
I think it's wrong to have
sex before you're married.

16:16.140 --> 16:17.760
I know. Me too.

16:17.800 --> 16:18.870
Okay.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.270
As long as you know how I el.

16:22.300 --> 16:24.360
And you know how your father feels.

16:24.400 --> 16:25.830
Thanks,Mom.

16:25.880 --> 16:27.410
These are great.

16:33.380 --> 16:36.330
Adrian. Adrian. Guess what.

16:36.380 --> 16:37.420
What?

16:39.350 --> 16:40.410
What?

16:42.270 --> 16:43.810
I can't hear you. Just say it.

16:43.850 --> 16:45.600
??

16:47.470 --> 16:48.660
Did y hear that?

16:49.620 --> 16:51.750
- Hey,what's going on?
- Nothing.

16:51.800 --> 16:53.260
My parents gave me birth control pills.

16:53.300 --> 16:55.310
- Oh,because of me?
- Why else?

16:55.350 --> 16:56.270
But we're not having sex.

16:56.330 --> 16:58.150
We're not even going out with each other.

16:58.470 --> 16:59.550
We're just friends.

16:59.580 --> 17:02.110
So are we. Maybe she wants
to have sex with sx eone else.

17:02.140 --> 17:05.079
No. I don't even know
if I want to have sex,

17:05.119 --> 17:08.670
and if I do want to have sex,
I can have safe sex.

17:08.700 --> 17:10.260
Well,that's good.

17:10.319 --> 17:12.700
If you have sex,you should
still use a condom though.

17:12.730 --> 17:14.220
Thanks for telling me.

17:14.280 --> 17:15.520
Oh,please.

17:15.560 --> 17:16.770
Your parents let you go on the pill?

17:16.810 --> 17:18.890
I'm not on it,I just have them.

17:18.940 --> 17:21.020
Because they found these
condoms Adrian gave me,

17:21.060 --> 17:22.869
so they thought I tld have the pill,

17:22.920 --> 17:26.940
you know,just as a precaution,
in case anything happens.

17:26.980 --> 17:29.240
But nothing is going to happen,right,Grace?

17:29.700 --> 17:31.370
Because you know that would be wrong.

17:31.770 --> 17:34.050
Especially since you're a Christian.

17:34.090 --> 17:35.450
Are you still dating your brother?

17:35.490 --> 17:37.260
Yeah,I am.

17:37.300 --> 17:38.980
But he's my stepbrother.

17:39.060 --> 17:40.330
We've never lived in the same house,

17:40.380 --> 17:42.260
and,uh,we're not related.

17:42.290 --> 17:45.620
Still,I don't think you're exactly
in a position to make any judgments.

17:45.680 --> 17:46.620
Neither are you.

17:46.650 --> 17:48.500
When are you gonna go out with him again?

17:48.560 --> 17:49.930
- Tonight.
- Oh.

17:50.710 --> 17:53.470
Yeah,I'm not doing anything tonight.

17:53.500 --> 17:56.450
I have to go to Amy's. I'm meeting
this couple that wants to adopt our son.

17:56.490 --> 17:59.660
"Our son"? You and Amy are a couple now?

17:59.690 --> 18:01.070
ll,she's the ther of my soC

18:01.110 --> 18:03.020
Thatl be the adoptive couple's son,

18:03.120 --> 18:04.550
not yours and Amy's son.

18:04.600 --> 18:05.960
Yeah,if it all works out.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.340
I hope it all works out.

18:07.370 --> 18:09.400
Yeah,me too. See you,Ricky.

18:11.450 --> 18:12.750
What you wanna do that for?

18:12.790 --> 18:14.060
You shouldn't tell him you
have birth control pills.

18:14.090 --> 18:15.920
He'll just gonna try and have sex with you.

18:15.960 --> 18:17.270
And so is half the school.

18:17.310 --> 18:17.880
Really?

18:17.910 --> 18:20.900
Oh,don't play all innocent with me,
you know what you're doing.

18:20.930 --> 18:22.220
You're trying to get back with Ricky.

18:22.260 --> 18:24.770
And we agreed that we were
not gonna go out with Ricky.

18:24.800 --> 18:26.690
I know,but I think that
w based on the fact

18:26.730 --> 18:28.440
that Ricky's not going out with us.

18:28.470 --> 18:29.500
What does that mean?

18:29.540 --> 18:31.340
It means that if Ricky
wants to go out with me

18:31.380 --> 18:32.820
I think I have to go out with him.

18:35.650 --> 18:37.320
What? I'm just being honest.

18:38.890 --> 18:40.470
I'm gonna go out with my brother tonight

18:40.500 --> 18:42.980
and then invite Ricky over
to have sex with me.

18:43.030 --> 18:45.140
How's that for being honest?

18:47.260 --> 18:48.790
- Hey,Grace.
- Hey.

18:49.560 --> 18:51.520
- What's new?
- Nothing,reall

18:51.560 --> 18:52.560
So you're not on the pill?

18:52.590 --> 18:54.420
No. But I have the pill.

18:54.450 --> 18:55.560
What happened to being Christian?

18:55.610 --> 18:57.680
What happened to waiting till you graduate

18:57.730 --> 18:58.680
and getting married?

18:58.720 --> 19:00.030
That's still the plan.

19:00.080 --> 19:00.740
Then why the pill?

19:00.800 --> 19:02.760
The promise ringe 't really wor

19:02.800 --> 19:04.370
Besides Tom gave it to Tammy.

19:04.410 --> 19:06.370
A ring from having sex.

19:06.410 --> 19:08.940
It's your belief that Jesus
doesn't want you to have sex

19:08.970 --> 19:10.340
that keeps us from having sex.

19:10.380 --> 19:11.920
I'm not having sex.

19:12.650 --> 19:13.800
Are you having sex?

19:13.830 --> 19:15.570
What? No. Why--?

19:16.400 --> 19:18.300
Why would you ask that?
I'm not having sex.

19:18.350 --> 19:19.500
People talk,Jack.

19:19.540 --> 19:21.490
???

19:21.530 --> 19:23.300
And I hope you kFA whing.

19:24.740 --> 19:26.880
Yeah,I do. I do know what I'm doing.

19:29.120 --> 19:30.550
Hi.

19:38.700 --> 19:39.710
Grace,wait up.

19:39.760 --> 19:40.880
Oh,hey,Ricky.

19:40.920 --> 19:43.530
Look,do yourself a favor and
don't spread it all over school

19:43.560 --> 19:45.090
that you're onbirth con

19:45.120 --> 19:46.750
It might attract the wrong guy.

19:46.800 --> 19:48.670
Yeah,d you don't wanna
attract the wrong guy.

19:48.720 --> 19:50.400
No. I don't.

19:50.450 --> 19:52.290
I wanna attract the right guy.

19:53.240 --> 19:55.880
I hopeverythinvegoes really
well tonight. Good luck.

19:55.910 --> 19:56.970
Yeah.

19:57.670 --> 20:00.180
So,uh,you're just gonna stay home tonight?

20:00.220 --> 20:01.100
Yeah.

20:01.130 --> 20:02.220
I'd like to call you,

20:02.270 --> 20:05.410
but if I call you,??

20:05.440 --> 20:08.070
and I just wanna focus on
Amy and the baby right now.

20:08.100 --> 20:10.070
Yeah,I understand. That's fine.

20:10.890 --> 20:13.520
But you can still call me.

20:13.560 --> 20:14.930
Anytime.

20:18.720 --> 20:20.670
So you gonna try to have sex with her?

20:20.710 --> 20:22.480
What do you care?

20:23.200 --> 20:24.540
I don't care.

20:24.580 --> 20:25.790
I don't care anymore.

20:25.820 --> 20:26.900
Neither do I.

20:26.940 --> 20:28.700
- Did you ever?
- Did I ever what?

20:28.730 --> 20:33.280
Did you ever care about me the
way you care about Amy or Grace?

20:33.310 --> 20:35.550
Yeah,Adrian,I did. But I don't now.

20:35.580 --> 20:37.040
And it's nothing you've said or done.

20:37.080 --> 20:38.850
I've had a great time with you.

20:38.890 --> 20:43.220
But it's the baby.
I'm having a baby with Amy Juergens.

20:43.260 --> 20:45.700
That doesn't mean you
should be with Amy Juergens.

20:45.740 --> 20:47.630
Then what does it mean?

21:08.010 --> 21:08.820
I'm so sorry.

21:08.860 --> 21:09.900
So you can say you're sorry.

21:09.940 --> 21:12.580
My dad insisted on dropping me
off at school himself today.

21:12.610 --> 21:14.320
I had to wait until the
driver could circle back

21:14.360 --> 21:15.640
and I could get a ride over here.

21:15.670 --> 21:18.110
Could your driver sign
a note for me? I'm gonna be late.

21:18.160 --> 21:20.070
No problem. We can drop you off at school.

21:20.110 --> 21:21.510
You don't have to take the bus.

21:21.540 --> 21:22.840
Hm,thanks.

21:22.870 --> 21:24.090
So...

21:24.140 --> 21:26.290
So you betABr get over to our
house and apologize to Amy

21:26.330 --> 21:29.110
before she and Ricky sign
the baby over for adoption.

21:33.730 --> 21:35.250
I can't,Ashley.

21:35.280 --> 21:37.180
I can't have anything
to do with that decision.

21:37.230 --> 21:40.380
And if Amy chooses to be
with Ricky,well,that's her choice.

21:40.410 --> 21:43.680
Hello? Remember me? Witness at your wedding.

21:43.720 --> 21:45.590
You married my ster.

21:45.640 --> 21:47.610
Yeah,well,that didn't count.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.400
Uh,yeah,it did count.

21:49.430 --> 21:53.410
Ashley,there's a reason
why people under 18 can't get married.

21:53.430 --> 21:56.050
Because people under
18 change their minds.

21:56.100 --> 21:57.210
People like Amy.

21:57.250 --> 21:59.590
e didn't chang'ther mindhe
You changed your mind.

21:59.620 --> 22:01.490
We both changed our minds.

22:01.530 --> 22:04.400
I changed my mind because
Amy wasn'tMIest with me.

22:04.850 --> 22:08.320
She clearly s feelingselcky
which I didn't think she had.

22:08.350 --> 22:11.390
Her feelings are all c Ben.
She's crazy right now.

22:11.430 --> 22:14.120
She's having Ricky's baby,
but she loves you.

22:14.160 --> 22:16.270
She might want to love Ricky.

22:16.730 --> 22:20.780
That would make things a lot
easier maybe,but she loves you.

22:20.830 --> 22:23.260
I don't know if that matters,
that she loves me

22:23.310 --> 22:24.690
or that I love her.

22:24.730 --> 22:26.800
I think the only thing that
matters right now is the baby.

22:26.850 --> 22:28.680
People wanna do what's best for the baby.

22:28.720 --> 22:30.640
And if what's best for the baby

22:31.070 --> 22:34.280
is Amy being with Ricky,well,
then that's what has to be,

22:34.770 --> 22:37.050
whether I like it or,

22:37.080 --> 22:39.070
whether it kills me or not.

22:39.110 --> 22:41.850
And believe me,heh,it's killing me.

22:41.880 --> 22:44.430
And if you're what's best for the baby,
then that's what has to be?

22:44.460 --> 22:46.020
How can I be what's best?

22:46.070 --> 22:48.520
Because you're what's
best for the baby's m

22:49.140 --> 22:50.980
You're what's best for Amy.

22:51.900 --> 22:54.390
Is everyone stupid but me?

22:54.430 --> 22:57.090
Am I the only one
who can see the big picture?

22:59.370 --> 23:01.430
I'm a doctor.
That's privileged information.

23:01.450 --> 23:03.150
No,I realize that,

23:03.190 --> 23:06.440
but  as off the record?

23:06.800 --> 23:09.010
Our daughters are best friends.

23:09.070 --> 23:11.210
Or at least they were.

23:11.250 --> 23:13.820
Your ex-wife won't even let
Lauren come over anymore.

23:13.860 --> 23:15.540
There is no off the record.

23:15.580 --> 23:19.380
Although I will tell you,I have
personal experience of Deborah's short leash.

23:19.410 --> 23:22.850
I get the feeling Ricky
won't go along with the adoption.

23:23.860 --> 23:25.760
???

23:25.790 --> 23:27.880
They've waited a long time to have a baby.

23:27.920 --> 23:29.150
I just don't wanna get their hopes up

23:29.200 --> 23:31.790
or Amy's hopes up,
if it isn't gonna happen.

23:31.840 --> 23:33.630
They want an open adoption.

23:33.670 --> 23:36.550
They want us to be
in the child's life. They're perfect.

23:36.730 --> 23:38.980
??

23:39.020 --> 23:41.950
What makes you feel that Ricky is not
gonna go along with the adoption?

23:41.990 --> 23:44.480
Because he said that
he didn't want the baby adopted

23:44.520 --> 23:46.330
and then he changed his mind.

23:47.320 --> 23:50.020
I think he did that just to be around Amy.

23:50.490 --> 23:54.730
That's my gut feeling.
My strong gut feeling.

23:56.660 --> 23:58.860
Trust your gut feeling.

24:00.840 --> 24:02.880
That's what uld tell anyone.

24:02.930 --> 24:06.530
You have a strong gut feeling,
trust your feeling.

24:06.570 --> 24:07.530
He got herhEregnant

24:07.570 --> 24:10.170
and now he wants to keep
the baby from being adopted

24:10.220 --> 24:11.510
just so he can be around her?

24:11.550 --> 24:14.540
Go back to "just so he can be around her."

24:14.590 --> 24:16.210
That's also part of your gut feeling.

24:16.250 --> 24:17.730
Why would he want to be around Amy?

24:17.770 --> 24:19.160
Maybe he has real feelings for Amy.

24:19.210 --> 24:22.760
Maybe Amy has real
feelings for Ricky. I don't know.

24:22.810 --> 24:24.710
You talk to him all the time,
you must know.

24:24.750 --> 24:27.520
No,I really don't. I don't know.

24:27.570 --> 24:31.350
He's a work in progress,
just like all the rest of us.

24:39.390 --> 24:41.080
- Hey.
- Hey.

24:41.120 --> 24:44.210
Private convCR.
The adts are talki Come on.

24:44.300 --> 24:45.390
Adults?

24:45.430 --> 24:48.150
Having a baby does not make
either one of us an adult.

24:48.860 --> 24:51.470
I don't wanna talk about tonightonth an

24:51.980 --> 24:53.310
Frankly,I'm a little nervous.

24:53.360 --> 24:55.020
Don't be nervous.
They're nice guys.

24:55.050 --> 24:56.240
Yeah,but I'm not.

24:56.270 --> 24:58.070
- What if they don't like me?
- They will.

24:58.130 --> 25:00.150
What if they don't like that
my parents are drug addicts

25:00.180 --> 25:01.720
and my dad's a child molester?

25:01.750 --> 25:03.110
You're not a drug addict.

25:03.150 --> 25:04.380
You're not a child molester.

25:04.420 --> 25:06.350
Yeah,but it's a lot of baggage.

25:06.410 --> 25:08.060
They know. They wouldn't be meeting you

25:08.100 --> 25:10.160
if they couldn't deal
with your family history.

25:10.190 --> 25:12.740
They just wanna make sure
that you're okay with the adoption.

25:13.140 --> 25:15.110
You know,even though we can still see our son,

25:15.140 --> 25:16.570
they're going to be the parents.

25:16.610 --> 25:19.540
They jusThnt to make so you
and I understaunhat,I think.

25:19.580 --> 25:20.620
What if they move away?

25:20.670 --> 25:21.730
I don't thinn''d do that.

25:21.760 --> 25:23.100
What if they get divorced?

25:23.140 --> 25:24.510
They've been together 10 years.

25:24.540 --> 25:26.560
Your parents have been
together longer than that.

25:26.600 --> 25:27.670
Are you having second thoughts?

25:27.710 --> 25:28.830
No,I just...

25:28.880 --> 25:31.120
Amy,I look at you and I just...

25:31.150 --> 25:32.940
After everything you've been through,

25:32.980 --> 25:34.850
I want this adoption to be perfect.

25:34.880 --> 25:37.400
I don't want you to be hurt
any more than I've hurt you already.

25:37.430 --> 25:41.280
Unfortunately,I think we're
in for a lifetime of hurt.

25:41.890 --> 25:43.630
That's just going to be how it is.

25:43.660 --> 25:47.590
Yeah,well,hopefully you and
I can be friends for a lifetime,

25:47.620 --> 25:49.590
because I don't think anyone
else can really understand

25:49.610 --> 25:51.260
what we're going through.

25:51.760 --> 25:53.270
I'll see you tonight.

25:53.310 --> 25:54.510
Should I dress up or anything?

25:54.560 --> 25:56.280
I feel like I'm going on a job interview.

25:56.320 --> 26:00.870
No,you don't have to dress up.
Just be yourself.

26:02.230 --> 26:03.620
Whoever that is.

26:17.440 --> 26:18.810
Hey.

26:20.380 --> 26:21.680
Come on in.

26:25.930 --> 26:27.090
These are for you.

26:28.490 --> 26:29.300
You have a vase?

26:29.330 --> 26:31.120
I can put them in a vase for you.

26:31.150 --> 26:34.150
Are you crazy?
You don't have to bring me flowers.

26:34.180 --> 26:36.930
We're not...courting.

26:36.960 --> 26:39.220
Actually,I am courtin c

26:39.260 --> 26:40.590
I like you.

26:40.650 --> 26:42.020
You mentioned you liked flowers.

26:42.050 --> 26:42.960
When?

26:42.990 --> 26:44.130
When we were talking.

26:44.160 --> 26:45.710
Before we fell asleep.

26:45.740 --> 26:46.930
You said you liked flowers.

26:46.970 --> 26:47.740
Did I?

26:47.780 --> 26:50.430
Are you gonna take these or should
I just put them in the sink?

26:50.470 --> 26:51.750
Here.

26:52.820 --> 26:54.350
Uh,you're welcome.

26:54.690 --> 26:58.560
Oh. Sorry. Thank you. I guess.

27:02.050 --> 27:03.970
But I don't know what th w mean.

27:04.010 --> 27:05.810
I'm kind of confused.

27:05.860 --> 27:07.430
You're confused?

27:07.460 --> 27:08.860
You're a difficult date.

27:08.900 --> 27:11.350
Date? I don't really date.

27:11.390 --> 27:12.920
We're just hanging out.

27:12.960 --> 27:15.030
I mean,we don't even have
to go to a movie or anything.

27:15.050 --> 27:17.020
We canust hang out here,Tif you want.

27:17.050 --> 27:19.400
You had a good time last time,right?

27:19.440 --> 27:21.700
Last time,I just came
over here to meet you.

27:21.740 --> 27:25.000
And I met you and I liked you.
I asked you out on a date.

27:25.050 --> 27:27.810
I asked you to go see a movie
and have dinner with me tonight.

27:27.850 --> 27:30.870
I thought that was just
a code or something.

27:30.900 --> 27:33.050
A code for what?

27:33.080 --> 27:36.000
I don't know. That you wanted
to come over and have sex with me.

27:37.060 --> 27:38.670
Are we really going out?

27:38.700 --> 27:40.160
Yeah.

27:40.200 --> 27:42.690
All right. If you want.

27:42.730 --> 27:44.950
???

27:44.980 --> 27:46.870
????

27:46.900 --> 27:48.560
Not tonight anyway.

27:48.600 --> 27:50.940
I just wanna spend
time with you,get to know you.

27:50.980 --> 27:51.870
Vertically.

27:51.920 --> 27:53.590
I prefer horizontally.

27:53.630 --> 27:55.290
- Adrian.
- Wait.

27:55.360 --> 27:56.570
You're not gay,are you?

27:56.610 --> 27:59.520
If a guy doesn't wanna
have sex with you,he's gay?

27:59.560 --> 28:01.110
Well,that's one of the signs.

28:01.150 --> 28:02.650
What's the other?

28:03.300 --> 28:04.350
Flowers?

28:05.360 --> 28:06.790
I'm not gay.

28:07.380 --> 28:09.200
If I were gay,why would I ask you out?

28:09.230 --> 28:10.320
I don't know.

28:10.350 --> 28:11.890
Did my Dad put you up to this?

28:11.920 --> 28:13.460
The flowers and the dinner and the movie

28:13.490 --> 28:14.960
and the whole stupid date idea?

28:15.000 --> 28:16.870
Your dad has no idea where I am,

28:16.910 --> 28:19.450
and I don't think he'd be too
happy about it if he did know.

28:19.480 --> 28:21.220
??

28:21.250 --> 28:26.530
I asked you out,you said yes,
and I wanna go out.

28:26.570 --> 28:27.750
I wanna go see a movie with you.

28:27.790 --> 28:30.260
I wanna sit in a dark
theater and hold hands.

28:30.290 --> 28:31.610
Maybe even make out a little.

28:31.640 --> 28:34.390
???and eat food with you,

28:34.430 --> 28:37.320
then bring you home and give
you a kiss good night.

28:37.360 --> 28:41.510
And then go home and think
about having sex with you.

28:41.560 --> 28:44.370
???until I'm ready
adto have sex with you.

28:44.410 --> 28:47.790
So grab your coat and
whatever ou need,and let's go.

28:47.820 --> 28:49.730
- You're not gay?
- I'm not gay.

28:49.780 --> 28:53.610
Wow. All right. I'll try anything once.

28:59.700 --> 29:00.980
Well,thanks for calling.

29:01.020 --> 29:04.020
But I don't exactly know who you are

29:04.060 --> 29:06.200
and I'm not really interested
in going to anything

29:06.250 --> 29:08.610
when coswhs are involved.

29:08.640 --> 29:10.880
Yeah,I just like to be me.

29:10.910 --> 29:13.670
No-- No,thank you for thinking of me.
Maybe some other time.

29:14.870 --> 29:16.620
Bye. I'll see you at school.

29:17.200 --> 29:19.670
That's,like,the fourth call
I've gotten tonight.

29:19.700 --> 29:21.390
Why are those guys calling you?

29:21.430 --> 29:22.660
I don't know.

29:22.740 --> 29:24.680
Well,I think I know.

29:24.710 --> 29:26.860
Tom,can I talk to Grace alone,please?

29:26.880 --> 29:28.080
Let me stay.

29:28.120 --> 29:29.710
I wanna talk to her alone.

29:29.750 --> 29:32.640
Come on. I got a feeling
this is a good one.

29:32.680 --> 29:34.270
Weren't you going over to Tammy's?

29:34.300 --> 29:35.710
You said no.

29:35.760 --> 29:40.170
You said I've been at Tammy's
every night for a week.

29:40.210 --> 29:42.070
What's one more night? You go ahead.

29:42.100 --> 29:43.690
Hot dog.

29:47.180 --> 29:50.480
So,what's with the sudden popularity?

29:50.510 --> 29:52.290
You didn't broadcast it all over school

29:52.330 --> 29:54.340
that you're on birth
control pills,did you?

29:54.370 --> 29:57.350
I told Adrian.
People could have overheard.

29:57.380 --> 30:00.730
Honey,I think that we may have
made aistake giving you those pills.

30:01.090 --> 30:03.250
If you don't need them,
I think you should give them back.

30:03.280 --> 30:05.070
No,no,Mom,please,please,can I keep them?

30:05.110 --> 30:08.570
Sweetie,why are you so desperate
to have the pills if you don need them?

30:08.600 --> 30:11.820
I love them.???

30:11.850 --> 30:13.390
They're Theal.

30:13.440 --> 30:16.220
The promise ring,
it wasn't reasto me. I???

30:16.250 --> 30:18.330
It was about abstract things,

30:18.370 --> 30:21.170
like being in love and
getting married someday

30:21.210 --> 30:23.120
and waiting and waiting and waiting.

30:23.170 --> 30:25.980
I'm still for the waiting
and waiting and waiting.

30:26.040 --> 30:27.250
I am too.

30:27.290 --> 30:29.700
And I think with
these pills I can wait.

30:29.750 --> 30:32.070
I really think
I can wait until I'm married.

30:32.110 --> 30:33.460
Because...?

30:33.500 --> 30:35.780
Because these are real.

30:35.830 --> 30:37.940
You know,these aren't
don't-haven'ex vitamins.

30:37.990 --> 30:40.240
These are birth control pills.

30:40.290 --> 30:42.270
You know,they reqth prescription.

30:42.320 --> 30:45.020
They require doctor's visits.

30:45.360 --> 30:49.480
You know,they remind me thatex
is mental and phyFAcal,

30:50.270 --> 30:55.640
and it's spiritual and sweaty and--

30:57.630 --> 30:58.760
ything.

30:59.660 --> 31:03.390
It's about takinutyour clothes off???

31:03.430 --> 31:06.500
and doing things you've never done before

31:06.540 --> 31:11.580
that take you to this place
that you never thought you could go

31:12.500 --> 31:14.830
where two people become one.

31:16.120 --> 31:18.290
Where are you going with this?

31:18.330 --> 31:19.870
Mom,don't you get it?

31:19.900 --> 31:21.820
Sex is everything,

31:21.860 --> 31:23.650
and if you're gonna have sex,
it should be with somebody

31:23.680 --> 31:25.940
at you wanna spend AB whole life with,

31:25.980 --> 31:28.750
someone you wanna create a life with.

31:28.790 --> 31:30.010
And even if you have these,

31:30.050 --> 31:32.060
these are just something
to use with somebody

31:32.110 --> 31:34.350
that you eventually don't
wanna use them with.

31:34.400 --> 31:36.800
You got all that fr those pills?

31:37.270 --> 31:38.790
They're not magic beans,you know.

31:38.820 --> 31:40.709
I know. But...

31:40.709 --> 31:42.290
I don't know,it's...

31:42.320 --> 31:46.760
Holding them makes everything you
ever told me about sex real for me.

31:47.110 --> 31:49.760
Like I finally understand it.

31:52.900 --> 31:54.300
Hello?

31:54.790 --> 31:56.510
Mm-mm,this is she.

31:57.700 --> 31:59.010
Who?

32:06.260 --> 32:07.920
Duncan. Hey.

32:09.270 --> 32:10.520
You here for Shawna?

32:10.550 --> 32:12.610
No,is she here?

32:12.650 --> 32:13.990
??

32:14.060 --> 32:15.640
Tonit?

32:15.680 --> 32:17.490
You don't even know
what day of the weektht is?

32:17.520 --> 32:18.890
No,no,I know it's Thursday.

32:18.940 --> 32:20.390
I just thought that,uh--

32:20.430 --> 32:22.230
I know what you thought.

32:22.270 --> 32:25.060
You got too much sex on your mind,Jack.

32:25.110 --> 32:26.840
Look,I know what's going on.

32:26.890 --> 32:28.340
E u and Shawna.

32:28.380 --> 32:31.430
You might thk I'm just a kid,
but I'm not stCFid.

32:31.470 --> 32:33.220
You two are kind of stupid.

32:33.250 --> 32:34.660
Stupid and obvious.

32:34.700 --> 32:35.400
I'm sorry.

32:35.450 --> 32:37.420
Don't be sorry. Be careful.

32:37.460 --> 32:39.260
Oh,we're being carefuSE

32:39.300 --> 32:41.450
Oh-- Oh I don't need to know all that.

32:41.490 --> 32:45.460
I want you to be careful
not to hurt my sister.

32:45.490 --> 32:46.690
I love my sister.

32:46.720 --> 32:48.080
She's all I got.

32:48.120 --> 32:49.880
And I don't want some guy coming down here

32:49.910 --> 32:52.980
who's noch older than me???

32:53.010 --> 32:54.440
thin she's just a good time.

32:54.480 --> 32:56.860
- ThE  not it at all.
- She's been hurt before.

32:56.890 --> 32:58.790
We've had a hard life.

32:59.090 --> 33:02.680
You might not believe this,
but we don't cOFose to live here.

33:02.720 --> 33:04.700
We don't have any options.

33:04.740 --> 33:07.250
d I don't wanna see more
hurt heaped upon my sister.

33:07.280 --> 33:09.760
I don't wanna see you heaped uhe sister,

33:09.820 --> 33:14.600
so can you kindly not engage in
any activities prior to my arriving home?

33:14.630 --> 33:16.160
If you know what I mean.

33:16.200 --> 33:17.000
Yeah.

33:17.040 --> 33:18.930
Let  ask you som Tng:

33:18.950 --> 33:20.630
at are your plans for my sister?

33:22.280 --> 33:23.900
- prom?
- Huh?

33:23.930 --> 33:26.250
I haven't thought about
where this was going.

33:26.300 --> 33:28.010
???

33:28.050 --> 33:30.040
Since m here,you wanna
go out and do somethinso

33:30.070 --> 33:32.750
So that's how it's gonna be?
So I'm like your backup plan?

33:32.780 --> 33:35.030
No,no. I just thought that since I was--

33:35.070 --> 33:36.630
I'm messing with you.

33:38.470 --> 33:39.320
Come on.

33:40.620 --> 33:42.160
Come on,man.

33:51.320 --> 33:54.820
So,Ricky,uh,your mother
speaks very highly of you.

33:54.850 --> 33:56.400
You know Ricky's mother?

33:56.430 --> 33:58.030
Not my biological mother.

33:58.070 --> 33:59.610
My foster mother. Margaret.

33:59.640 --> 34:00.930
She's their social worker.

34:00.970 --> 34:02.270
Margaret's a nice woman.

34:02.300 --> 34:05.090
Such a nice woman,
married to such a nice man.

34:05.130 --> 34:07.570
They're not the usual
foster@@ents,you know.

34:07.960 --> 34:09.739
They're the best foster parents in the world.

34:09.800 --> 34:12.540
They took me in when
I don't think anyone else would have.

34:12.580 --> 34:15.850
I mean,an older kid,a boy.
Everyone's afraid of older boys,

34:15.889 --> 34:19.239
especially with troubled pasts
and crazy drug-addict pare

34:19.280 --> 34:22.310
I wouldn't be the maI am today
if it wasn't for them.

34:22.350 --> 34:25.060
I'd probably be in prison,
just like my dad.

34:25.110 --> 34:27.909
These people,they're saints.
And I'm not the only kid.

34:27.940 --> 34:31.030
They do this all the time,
usually just short-term

34:31.070 --> 34:32.860
until they can get the kids placed.

34:32.889 --> 34:36.070
There are just so few people
who will take in older children.

34:36.500 --> 34:39.480
People want babies. Like ours.

34:39.500 --> 34:42.810
They want a healthy,perfect baby
that doesn't have any problems.

34:43.179 --> 34:44.830
It's mh harder to take  Lds like me...

34:44.880 --> 34:47.280
What's the matter,
things not going your way?

34:47.310 --> 34:48.650
What do you know about this?

34:48.699 --> 34:50.800
- This?
- Yeah,this.

34:50.830 --> 34:52.929
Ricky is sabotaging
the adoption,isn't he?

34:52.960 --> 34:55.960
I don't talk to Ricky.

34:56.010 --> 34:57.800
- Who do you talk to?
- Ben.

34:57.840 --> 35:00.020
You didn't have anything
to do with what's going on?

35:00.040 --> 35:02.520
Really,Mom,I don't know
what's going on in there.

35:02.570 --> 35:05.531
I know what's going on in there
about half an hour from now,

35:05.531 --> 35:08.560
but I don't know what's
goin in there right now.

35:17.540 --> 35:20.170
That kid is so screwed up.

35:20.200 --> 35:21.860
Yeah.

35:24.550 --> 35:26.290
It just doesn't feel right,does it?

35:26.330 --> 35:28.300
No,it doesn't feel right.

35:28.760 --> 35:31.300
And you know what?
I'm not crazy about an open adoption.

35:31.330 --> 35:34.750
Yeah,I like George,but I don't know.

35:34.800 --> 35:36.940
I want our family back.

35:36.990 --> 35:38.360
our foster kids back.

35:38.400 --> 35:40.220
I don't care if they were
foster children.

35:40.270 --> 35:43.330
I don't care what you call them.
Those were our children.

35:43.370 --> 35:45.140
Let's talk to Margaret.

35:45.910 --> 35:47.900
I think we better talk to Anne too.

35:47.950 --> 35:49.920
And George. And Amy.

35:49.970 --> 35:52.320
I don't want them to feel like
the baby is some kind of booby prize

35:52.350 --> 35:54.840
for us not getting the children we wanted.

35:54.880 --> 35:57.550
And truthfully,if we take this baby,

35:57.600 --> 35:59.810
then we're not going back into
the foster system,

35:59.840 --> 36:03.100
and our foster children will probably
never havevenother home together.

36:03.130 --> 36:04.830
We'll probably never be able to adopt the

36:04.870 --> 36:08.300
I don't think Ricky's ever
gonna let us adopt that baby either.

36:08.340 --> 36:11.500
We're gonna be fighting for
whatever adoption we choose.

36:11.780 --> 36:13.830
And if we don't choose Amy's baby,

36:13.870 --> 36:16.430
we know that that baby
will still be taken care of.

36:16.470 --> 36:18.100
I agree.

36:18.150 --> 36:20.680
We're the only ones fighting
for the other children.

36:24.460 --> 36:26.270
Are you sure you don't wanna come in?

36:26.300 --> 36:27.470
Very sure.

36:27.500 --> 36:30.440
Okay,then,um...

36:30.460 --> 36:32.060
I had fun.

36:32.110 --> 36:32.980
Did you?

36:33.040 --> 36:36.670
Yeah,I actually did.

36:36.700 --> 36:39.220
Me too. So we'll do this again?

36:39.260 --> 36:41.040
- "This"?
- Yeah,this.

36:41.070 --> 36:45.650
Yes,we'll,uh,do this again.

36:51.530 --> 36:52.780
Night,Adrian.

36:52.810 --> 36:54.550
NiIFt,Max.

37:18.270 --> 37:19.270
Hey,Adrian.

37:19.300 --> 37:21.100
Ju wanted to see  yere doing anything.

37:21.130 --> 37:22.930
I figured I could swing by.

37:22.970 --> 37:24.400
Call me if you want me.

37:37.800 --> 37:39.060
It's the wrong number.

37:51.810 --> 37:53.230
Hey,did the guy bring that?

37:53.260 --> 37:54.470
Oh,how'd it go?d

37:54.510 --> 37:55.220
How'd what go?

37:55.260 --> 37:56.730
The meeting. With Ricky.

37:56.770 --> 37:58.320
What did Donovan and Leon think?

37:58.350 --> 38:00.520
- How would I know?
- What do you mean?

38:00.570 --> 38:01.880
You said you were gonna
talk to them afterwards.

38:01.920 --> 38:03.340
They're parked outside the house.

38:03.370 --> 38:04.860
.Oh,I forgot about that.

38:04.890 --> 38:06.330
How could you forget about that?

38:06.370 --> 38:07.530
If this adoption doesn't go through,

38:07.560 --> 38:10.900
the sahing's gonna happen
over and over again.

38:10.950 --> 38:13.120
I don't thk that Ricky
wants the baby adopted

38:13.160 --> 38:14.650
I think he's just trying to get to Amy.

38:14.680 --> 38:16.260
Oh. Well,I do know about that.

38:16.290 --> 38:17.780
Ashley talked to Ben. He's coming over.

38:17.820 --> 38:19.340
Ben doesn't have anything
to do with the baby.

38:19.370 --> 38:21.390
Somes you are so clueless.

38:21.420 --> 38:24.330
Is that who Ashley was talking
to on the phone all night? Ben?

38:24.370 --> 38:27.010
I doubt it. It's probably
the guy she was smoking with.

38:27.040 --> 38:29.580
You really should pay more
attention to your children.

38:38.470 --> 38:39.910
Thanks,Mom.

38:42.480 --> 38:43.770
You know,Ben's coming over.

38:43.830 --> 38:45.310
No,he's not.

38:45.350 --> 38:47.120
He's not speaking to me.

38:51.300 --> 38:53.300
Hey,Ben's at the front door.

38:55.750 --> 38:57.370
I'm going to kill him.

39:03.960 --> 39:05.260
What are you doing here?

39:05.310 --> 39:06.360
I came here to talk to you.

39:06.400 --> 39:09.690
You could have picked up your
phone 37 times I've called.

39:09.720 --> 39:13.040
ty-seven? More like a milln and 37.

39:13.100 --> 39:15.320
- Can I come in?
- Yes.

39:17.820 --> 39:20.450
Can't I have one private
minva in this house?

39:20.490 --> 39:22.730
I want you out! All of you!

39:23.280 --> 39:25.170
And you know what? That includes you.

39:25.200 --> 39:25.910
Meeting go badly?

39:25.940 --> 39:28.090
No,the meeting did not go badly.

39:28.130 --> 39:29.170
They loved Ricky.

39:29.200 --> 39:31.040
- And do you love Ricky?
- No.

39:31.640 --> 39:33.410
BuLYat does not mean I still love you.

39:33.440 --> 39:34.740
I think that you still lov.

39:34.770 --> 39:37.660
The question is,do you love me
enough to spend a life together?

39:37.690 --> 39:39.380
And I understand that you and Ricky

39:39.410 --> 39:41.710
are gonna ha to share the baby
throughout the baby's life,

39:41.740 --> 39:42.860
but I hope you understand

39:42.890 --> 39:45.900
that I have no intention
of sharing you with Ricky.

39:46.400 --> 39:48.400
So who do you love,Amy?

39:49.150 --> 39:50.960
Who do you wanna spend your life with?

39:50.990 --> 39:56.140
Right now,I think the only person
that I love is this baby inside me.

39:57.730 --> 39:59.780
And I know you're all listening in there.

40:02.310 --> 40:06.080
Even if I do love you,I am really,
really,really angry with you.

40:06.120 --> 40:07.890
Well,I hope you'll get over it.

40:07.920 --> 40:11.710
Because I know I was really,really,
rely angry with you,and I got over it.

40:11.750 --> 40:13.290
What do you have to be angry with me about?

40:13.330 --> 40:15.980
You knew I was pregnant
when you met me,or shortly after.

40:16.010 --> 40:19.410
By the time I knew,I was already
so in love with you that it didn't matter.

40:19.840 --> 40:21.410
It didn't matter then,n,doesn't matter now.

40:21.460 --> 40:23.980
It's not gonna matter when
we're at our son's wedding.

40:25.120 --> 40:27.380
???

40:27.440 --> 40:29.075
I had to have some time
to think about it,

40:29.075 --> 40:32.190
but I love you.

40:32.230 --> 40:35.590
And unlike Ricky,I mean it.
I really love you.

40:35.630 --> 40:37.630
Well,what i,want some
time to thibout it?

40:37.670 --> 40:39.180
Take all the time you need.

40:39.210 --> 40:40.570
But I hope you realize
how much I love you

40:40.600 --> 40:42.410
before you let someone hurt you again.

40:42.440 --> 40:43.470
Someone like Ricky?

40:43.490 --> 40:46.210
No,not someone like Ricky. RickLY

40:46.250 --> 40:48.000
It's just so comt ed.

40:48.040 --> 40:49.830
This is his baby.

40:49.880 --> 40:52.620
He is the father of this baby.

40:53.340 --> 40:55.010
I wish it was you,Ben,but it's not.

40:55.030 --> 40:56.860
Even Ricky could tell you,

40:56.890 --> 41:00.510
OFrents of a baby aren't necessarily
the two people who created that baby.

41:00.550 --> 41:03.960
The parents are the two people
who take care of the baby.

41:04.000 --> 41:07.740
And I am willing to take care of you
and that baby for the rest of my life.

41:07.770 --> 41:11.080
Even if it means seeing Ricky
every Christmas and Thanksgiving.

41:11.120 --> 41:14.600
Maybe I don't wantn' to
take care of me and my baby.

41:14.650 --> 41:15.590
I don't want your pity.

41:15.610 --> 41:17.120
That's you think this is? Pity?

41:17.150 --> 41:17.850
Is it?

41:17.880 --> 41:18.660
No.

41:18.720 --> 41:20.390
Because I don't need
you to care of me.

41:20.420 --> 41:21.750
I can take care of myself.

41:21.780 --> 41:22.810
I'm sure that you can.

41:22.840 --> 41:24.460
I don't need you to take  of the baby.

41:24.510 --> 41:25.820
The baby will be adopted.

41:25.850 --> 41:28.210
Not that you've ever asked my opinion,

41:28.260 --> 41:29.910
or that I should even offer my opinion,

41:29.910 --> 41:34.060
but I don't want
the baby to be adopted.

41:34.090 --> 41:37.390
I wanna be your husband
and a stepfather to yo.

41:37.430 --> 41:39.320
I wanna be a family.

41:40.160 --> 41:42.250
And I realize that we're
too young to get married,

41:42.290 --> 41:43.470
but guess what?

41:43.500 --> 41:45.180
We're gonna get older every year.

41:45.880 --> 41:48.540
And I wanna grow older together.

41:49.400 --> 41:53.380
I wanna be with you on your 16th birthday

41:53.410 --> 41:55.860
and your 60th birthday.

41:57.090 --> 41:59.610
And I want him to be with us.

42:11.020 --> 42:12.950
Just tell me you'll think about it.

42:12.970 --> 42:16.270
Okay,I'll think about it.

42:16.300 --> 42:17.880
Tell me you love me?

42:18.780 --> 42:20.070
I love you.
