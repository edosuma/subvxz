00:02.253 --> 00:04.547
<i>Previously on Marvel's</i>
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:04.839 --> 00:06.508
<i>- We got him.</i>
<i>- Hive.</i>

00:06.591 --> 00:07.967
He has to be destroyed.

00:08.635 --> 00:11.763
<i>Hive could create a virus
that transforms any humans</i>

00:11.846 --> 00:12.931
<i>into swayed Inhumans.</i>

00:13.014 --> 00:15.642
If he finds a way to disperse it
high enough in the atmosphere...

00:15.725 --> 00:19.062
He could infect a significant
percentage of the human race.

00:21.981 --> 00:23.400
<i>I told him everything.</i>

00:23.483 --> 00:24.651
Including the plans to the Zephyr.

00:24.734 --> 00:27.112
<i>And the fact that it has
high-altitude capabilities...</i>

00:27.195 --> 00:28.738
Hive has his delivery system now.

00:28.822 --> 00:31.366
<i>- I want to find Hive.</i>
<i>- And get revenge?</i>

00:31.449 --> 00:32.867
<i>This isn't about revenge.</i>

00:32.951 --> 00:34.369
Hey.

00:35.078 --> 00:36.788
You're in pain.

00:46.881 --> 00:47.924
Please.

00:49.008 --> 00:51.136
Take me back.

00:53.221 --> 00:54.889
Interesting.

00:58.810 --> 01:00.270
Your name...

01:01.146 --> 01:04.357
Something pretty.

01:05.900 --> 01:07.902
Not pretty like the sky...

01:09.446 --> 01:10.947
A flower.

01:13.324 --> 01:14.367
Daisy.

01:14.868 --> 01:16.327
Please.

01:25.920 --> 01:27.005
What?

01:28.006 --> 01:29.007
What is it?

01:30.675 --> 01:33.094
- I can't.
- What? Why not?

01:34.554 --> 01:36.014
What did S.H.I.E.L.D. do to you?

01:36.097 --> 01:39.058
It's not what S.H.I.E.L.D. did to me,
it's what that creature stole from you.

01:40.769 --> 01:44.022
They made you impervious.

01:44.105 --> 01:45.398
Please.

01:47.192 --> 01:49.319
Just...

01:49.402 --> 01:50.528
No.

01:55.575 --> 01:56.868
Sorry, Daisy.

02:21.810 --> 02:22.852
Once the hangar doors are open,

02:22.936 --> 02:25.271
his monster patrol will storm the base.

02:25.396 --> 02:26.606
Any idea how many Hive has infected?

02:26.731 --> 02:27.857
Everyone in Quadrant D.

02:27.941 --> 02:29.609
Along with agents O'Brien and Marshall.

02:29.734 --> 02:30.902
Something like 20 agents.

02:30.985 --> 02:32.070
It's 28.

02:37.325 --> 02:38.409
Was that Daisy?

02:45.250 --> 02:46.626
Perhaps this was always...

02:49.420 --> 02:50.421
No more talking then.

02:52.173 --> 02:53.258
Daisy's in trouble.

02:53.341 --> 02:56.177
Sir, there's been a malfunction
in Daisy's containment module.

02:56.261 --> 02:57.303
Did you check the feed from the plane?

02:57.428 --> 02:58.513
Yeah, it's gone dark
after the earthquake.

02:58.596 --> 03:00.974
So, either the primitives
found their way down to her, or...

03:01.099 --> 03:02.851
- She found a way up.
- No.

03:02.934 --> 03:04.519
Take a look. Report back ASAP.

03:04.602 --> 03:05.687
Fitz.

03:07.438 --> 03:08.815
What the hell
are your primitives capable of?

03:08.940 --> 03:11.734
Well, it's hard to say, really. I mean,
these creatures are in their infancy.

03:11.818 --> 03:12.861
You did create them, didn't you?

03:12.944 --> 03:14.487
It was either that, or be eaten.

03:14.612 --> 03:16.656
I never would have created something
so unsophisticated.

03:16.781 --> 03:19.617
I mean, the crudeness of
these creatures is really quite...

03:20.952 --> 03:22.370
Heart-breaking.

03:22.453 --> 03:24.330
We'll discuss the consequences
of your science fair later.

03:24.455 --> 03:26.499
Right now, we need to know
exactly what we're up against.

03:26.624 --> 03:29.502
The primitives possess adrenaline-
induced peak human strength,

03:29.627 --> 03:31.170
but rather poor eyesight.

03:31.296 --> 03:33.673
They're connected to Hive
in the same way that Daisy was,

03:33.798 --> 03:36.050
but they don't exhibit
any original thoughts of their own.

03:36.134 --> 03:37.176
They have memories?

03:37.302 --> 03:40.471
They possess memories of previous
talents, weapon skills, and the like.

03:40.555 --> 03:44.267
We have 28 ex-S.H.I.E.L.D. agents
that know this base inside out.

03:44.350 --> 03:46.311
How long before they find their way
through the hangar doors?

03:46.394 --> 03:47.687
Several hours at least.

03:52.150 --> 03:53.443
They may not have to.

03:57.071 --> 03:58.114
They're in the vents.

03:58.197 --> 03:59.240
Lock down the armoury.

04:00.658 --> 04:02.785
Simmons, secure what
you can in the lab,

04:02.869 --> 04:04.495
then rendezvous in my office.

04:04.579 --> 04:06.080
Lincoln and I will protect
the nerve centre.

04:10.168 --> 04:11.586
So I'll just stay here?

04:16.007 --> 04:17.507
Daisy took the module into the plane.

04:17.591 --> 04:19.677
To stop Hive.

04:19.761 --> 04:21.053
You think that she can do it?

04:22.137 --> 04:23.932
Get us some rope in case she can't.

05:16.776 --> 05:19.570
You know, killing me
won't make the pain go away.

05:19.654 --> 05:21.322
Or will it? I can't remember...

05:27.495 --> 05:29.038
I don't want you to die.

05:29.122 --> 05:30.164
I want you to suffer.

05:34.335 --> 05:35.545
It seems you're the one who's suffering.

05:38.256 --> 05:39.632
I'm sorry you won't feel our connection.

05:41.759 --> 05:43.511
Pieces... Solving a puzzle.

05:56.399 --> 05:58.693
But we must continue without you.

06:09.162 --> 06:11.539
Bones don't hold me up.

06:11.622 --> 06:14.292
I'm held up by all the parts
working as one.

06:24.135 --> 06:25.178
Glad we found you, boss.

06:25.261 --> 06:28.139
We've got communication coordinates
from the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents.

06:28.222 --> 06:30.099
How did we manage to...

06:30.183 --> 06:32.477
Right. That's how.

06:32.560 --> 06:34.687
Absolution. I'll load the warhead in.

06:39.275 --> 06:42.111
So, she, uh, back on the team?

06:43.362 --> 06:45.281
I believe her presence guarantees

06:45.364 --> 06:47.075
they won't try to blow us out of the sky

06:47.158 --> 06:49.202
before we reach altitude.

06:49.285 --> 06:51.496
What about the rest of these
friendly faces?

06:52.663 --> 06:55.291
All but a few will stay behind

06:55.374 --> 06:57.168
to destroy the last of S.H.I.E.L.D.

07:01.631 --> 07:02.840
When in doubt, follow the leader.

07:04.342 --> 07:05.384
Then try to keep up.

07:08.721 --> 07:10.014
The armoury's up ahead.

07:10.098 --> 07:11.474
I'll secure the weapons rack, but...

07:24.904 --> 07:26.864
No. No. No.

07:28.032 --> 07:29.408
Yo-Yo, what'd you do?

07:30.451 --> 07:31.577
What'd you do?

07:51.264 --> 07:52.723
I can fly this.

07:52.807 --> 07:55.101
You have experience with this thing?

07:55.184 --> 07:56.811
It looks a little sophisticated.

07:56.894 --> 08:00.273
Between Will Daniels and Grant Ward,
I have enough.

08:10.741 --> 08:12.201
Help me get her into the workshop.

08:12.285 --> 08:13.327
They're right behind us.

08:20.459 --> 08:21.752
Close the door! Close the door!

08:25.631 --> 08:26.674
What the hell happened?

08:26.757 --> 08:28.301
The primitives got to the armoury first.

08:28.384 --> 08:29.802
Yo-Yo took a bullet in the gut for me.

08:30.595 --> 08:33.054
Sir, where's everyone else?

09:15.598 --> 09:17.433
Did we just stop mid-air?

09:17.516 --> 09:20.353
I've transitioned the aircraft
into vertical flight.

09:20.436 --> 09:21.479
We're ascending.

09:21.562 --> 09:24.023
Straight up to 100,000 feet.

09:25.900 --> 09:29.987
Calculations are helping me
collect my thoughts.

09:30.988 --> 09:33.407
We'll set the timer to blow the warhead
at the optimal elevation.

09:33.491 --> 09:35.660
Dispersing the formula
into the stratosphere.

09:35.743 --> 09:37.119
And by dawn,

09:37.203 --> 09:38.955
it will descend onto most of Europe.

09:39.038 --> 09:41.165
Hang on. Hang on, hang on.

09:41.249 --> 09:43.626
We're still riding
this bloody space elevator.

09:43.709 --> 09:45.920
How are we supposed to connect
to all our new brothers and sisters

09:46.003 --> 09:47.672
if we've blown ourselves to bits?

09:49.423 --> 09:51.801
<i>We'll drop in the
containment module to safety</i>

09:51.884 --> 09:53.427
<i>before it detonates.</i>

09:54.262 --> 09:55.972
<i>Unless you wanna stay behind.</i>

09:56.931 --> 09:58.766
<i>Make sure nothing goes wrong.</i>

10:15.783 --> 10:16.951
Look. It's really bad.

10:17.034 --> 10:18.077
She's bleeding out.

10:18.953 --> 10:19.996
I can't see.

10:20.079 --> 10:21.706
Hey, Electric Company,
can you light things up?

10:21.789 --> 10:22.832
I got it.

10:22.957 --> 10:24.292
That's not right.

10:24.875 --> 10:26.419
She's bleeding way too fast.

10:26.502 --> 10:30.089
Her metabolism must have increased
to compensate for her Inhuman speed.

10:30.172 --> 10:31.299
Can you fix it?

10:31.382 --> 10:33.426
If we can get her an injection
of acebutolol from the lab.

10:33.509 --> 10:34.552
We can't get to the lab

10:34.635 --> 10:36.345
'cause this idiot turned good agents
into kill zombies.

10:36.429 --> 10:37.513
So come up with something else.

10:37.596 --> 10:39.807
I have been kidnapped,
repeatedly threatened...

10:39.890 --> 10:42.310
Yeah, well, Daisy said you were
more than happy to play mad scientist.

10:42.393 --> 10:44.145
- Well, the alternative was death.
- I need tools, medicine.

10:44.228 --> 10:45.354
Stop!

10:46.188 --> 10:48.065
We can either argue or we can save her.

10:48.149 --> 10:49.400
Not both.

10:49.483 --> 10:50.609
We're trapped in this room,

10:50.693 --> 10:52.278
so we need to stop the bleeding
with something in here.

10:54.322 --> 10:55.740
You're gonna be all right.

10:59.118 --> 11:01.078
I didn't say it was a good idea,
but it may be our best.

11:01.162 --> 11:02.413
- It could kill her.
- We can do better.

11:02.496 --> 11:03.956
Not in the time we have.

11:07.793 --> 11:08.919
Hold this.

11:10.880 --> 11:12.131
No.

11:13.424 --> 11:14.592
Mack.

12:07.311 --> 12:08.562
The heat.

12:20.825 --> 12:22.368
There are a lot of agents still out there.

12:23.369 --> 12:24.703
Are you sure you've stabilised?

12:25.329 --> 12:28.082
Hey, don't do that to me.

12:28.499 --> 12:29.875
Don't take a bullet in the gut for me.

12:30.584 --> 12:32.211
I try and catch.

12:32.294 --> 12:33.337
Too slow.

12:34.672 --> 12:35.923
This is very impressive.

12:36.006 --> 12:37.383
Is this the young Scotsman's work?

12:38.175 --> 12:39.635
Huh. Of course.

12:40.177 --> 12:41.470
You know if he has
a working model yet?

12:43.431 --> 12:44.723
Are you serious?

12:46.559 --> 12:48.185
Oh, this is stunning.

12:52.189 --> 12:53.816
Must be looking for another way in.

13:09.665 --> 13:10.708
What are you doing here?

13:10.791 --> 13:12.835
Grabbing you, taking back the Zephyr.

13:13.961 --> 13:15.796
- No, Fitz, don't open that.
- What?

13:16.005 --> 13:17.548
I should be in here.

13:17.631 --> 13:18.674
I'm a liability.

13:21.427 --> 13:24.054
Okay, well, I think
there's some weapons in the back.

13:28.601 --> 13:29.643
Guys, she's burning up.

13:30.436 --> 13:33.105
Could be a sign of infection,
which means we'll need antibiotics.

13:33.189 --> 13:34.857
And it's hot as hell in here.

13:34.940 --> 13:36.609
Sweating like a horse.

13:36.692 --> 13:38.652
It is. I thought the power was off.

13:38.736 --> 13:40.070
The heating system is old-school.

13:40.154 --> 13:41.989
It doesn't need electricity.

13:42.072 --> 13:43.699
What, they crank up the heat?
Why would they do that?

13:43.782 --> 13:44.825
Trying to flush us out?

13:44.909 --> 13:46.202
Why else?

13:47.328 --> 13:48.370
She's blinding them.

13:49.163 --> 13:50.498
Simmons, genius, you say.

13:51.165 --> 13:52.625
She must have figured it out.

13:52.708 --> 13:54.752
Their eyes were damaged,
clouded over.

13:54.835 --> 13:57.004
I suspected they could see somehow,
but it must be...

13:57.087 --> 13:58.506
- Infrared.
- Must be infrared.

13:59.882 --> 14:01.425
Clever girl.

14:01.509 --> 14:03.469
Crank the heating up
to 100 degrees Fahrenheit,

14:03.552 --> 14:05.471
and we're free to move around
as we please.

14:05.554 --> 14:06.805
So you want us to go out there
on a hunch

14:06.889 --> 14:08.599
and hope those things
don't rip us apart?

14:08.682 --> 14:11.185
It's not a hunch, it's science.

14:14.438 --> 14:16.857
It's a science hunch.

14:16.941 --> 14:18.025
Doctor.

14:44.009 --> 14:46.178
Well, we better follow him.

14:46.262 --> 14:48.013
He has no idea where he's going.

14:53.519 --> 14:55.813
It's like he scraped me
out of my own skull.

15:00.526 --> 15:03.821
Even when I tried killing him,
he beat me.

15:03.904 --> 15:05.864
My powers are nothing
compared to Hive.

15:08.033 --> 15:09.868
I don't give a damn about your powers.

15:10.536 --> 15:12.580
They're not what made you an agent.

15:13.289 --> 15:14.748
- I did.
- May.

15:15.791 --> 15:20.045
You... You have no idea what I did.

15:20.129 --> 15:21.547
I have nothing left.

15:21.630 --> 15:23.090
Then why did Andrew save you?

15:23.799 --> 15:26.552
Yeah, you did a lot of bad things.

15:27.344 --> 15:31.056
All you can do now
is balance the scales, do some good.

15:32.641 --> 15:35.519
You wanna give up,
live in a box, go ahead.

15:35.603 --> 15:38.689
But that hurt stays in there with you,
believe me.

15:39.732 --> 15:40.774
Listen.

15:41.817 --> 15:43.819
I may not always show it, but I...

15:44.528 --> 15:45.654
May!

16:02.463 --> 16:05.090
Wait, wait, wait,
if you kill me, you'll die, I swear.

16:05.215 --> 16:08.677
I swear, I have
a weapon in place on this plane

16:08.761 --> 16:09.887
that's designed to kill you.

16:10.804 --> 16:12.389
So if you shoot me,

16:12.473 --> 16:14.725
I can't tell you what that is.

16:15.893 --> 16:17.895
- You won't see it coming.
- Leave him alone!

16:17.978 --> 16:20.314
Giyera, listen to me, look at me.

16:20.397 --> 16:22.191
You and I have a connection, right?

16:22.274 --> 16:23.400
Not any more.

16:26.153 --> 16:27.863
I swept the plane.

16:27.946 --> 16:29.073
Didn't see anything.

16:29.156 --> 16:31.367
I'm telling the truth, I swear,
you won't see it.

16:35.120 --> 16:36.538
- Show me.
- Okay.

16:36.622 --> 16:37.748
Okay.

16:38.165 --> 16:40.292
Okay, just let me put this down.

16:42.002 --> 16:44.463
Remember, we don't wanna hurt you
if we don't have to.

16:44.588 --> 16:45.839
People that are under sway,

16:46.507 --> 16:48.926
they're not in control of their actions.

16:50.344 --> 16:51.929
They're not bad people.

16:53.681 --> 16:56.266
Well, except you.

16:57.351 --> 16:59.436
You were a murderous swine
before all this.

17:10.280 --> 17:12.866
I did tell you a few times.

17:17.954 --> 17:18.997
Well?

17:23.627 --> 17:24.670
I'm okay.

17:27.339 --> 17:29.717
We disabled the containment module.

17:29.800 --> 17:31.385
Hive can't escape.

17:31.468 --> 17:32.636
So you're with us.

17:34.638 --> 17:36.473
You okay? You're shaking.

17:36.557 --> 17:37.975
She's going through withdrawals.

17:38.058 --> 17:39.727
Plus, the Zephyr
can handle high altitude,

17:39.810 --> 17:41.311
but it's not designed for it.

17:41.395 --> 17:43.188
It's sub-freezing outside,
which also means...

17:43.313 --> 17:44.314
Air's getting thin in here.

17:45.315 --> 17:47.735
So we should limit our movements

17:47.818 --> 17:49.069
and try and keep warm.

17:55.492 --> 17:56.535
So what do we do next?

17:57.244 --> 17:59.204
This is as far as we got.

18:01.165 --> 18:02.207
Seal off the stairs.

18:02.332 --> 18:04.334
Not sure how long it'll hold, but, hey.

18:09.381 --> 18:12.676
- Oh. Thank God.
- Thank God you missed.

18:13.844 --> 18:14.845
Is she okay?

18:15.220 --> 18:17.181
She's stable for now.

18:18.348 --> 18:19.349
Have you seen the others?

18:19.433 --> 18:21.477
I checked the containment room,
and by the looks of it,

18:21.560 --> 18:23.061
Fitz and May
climbed up into the Zephyr.

18:23.187 --> 18:24.229
Then there's hope they'll stop them.

18:24.354 --> 18:26.482
Or be blown to bits.

18:26.565 --> 18:28.066
Did you notice the heat?

18:28.192 --> 18:29.401
I increased the temperature because...

18:29.526 --> 18:30.569
We figured it out, yeah.

18:30.694 --> 18:32.237
I did. Picked up on it straight away.

18:32.362 --> 18:35.324
We'd make a pretty good team,
here at the Strategic Homeland...

18:35.407 --> 18:36.700
What comes after "Homeland"?

18:36.784 --> 18:37.868
Just say "S.H.I.E.L.D."

18:38.452 --> 18:40.162
Are you all right?

18:40.245 --> 18:41.538
What happened?

18:42.372 --> 18:44.208
Mack lit me on fire.

18:44.291 --> 18:45.375
It's a long story.

18:45.459 --> 18:47.169
- She needs a hospital.
- There's no way out.

18:47.252 --> 18:48.879
Took me a while to open
the lockdown window,

18:48.962 --> 18:50.005
but it's a 40-foot drop.

18:50.088 --> 18:51.256
What about the underground tunnels?

18:51.381 --> 18:52.382
Sealed shut.

18:52.466 --> 18:53.967
I have a way.

18:54.051 --> 18:55.260
Hey, who came up with...

18:55.385 --> 18:57.179
Fitz was inspired by your work.

18:57.262 --> 18:59.056
Put a few new tricks up my sleeve.

19:01.308 --> 19:03.185
- Remote Quinjet.
- Hell, yeah.

19:03.268 --> 19:04.478
It's on its way.

19:04.561 --> 19:06.522
But let's be clear.

19:06.605 --> 19:09.233
I'll get you to Medical, to safety.

19:09.316 --> 19:11.276
We'll contact Talbot,
have him authorise military force

19:11.401 --> 19:12.402
to take back our base.

19:12.486 --> 19:14.863
But then I take the Quinjet
to intercept the Zephyr

19:14.947 --> 19:15.989
on my own.

19:16.073 --> 19:17.908
Sir, I have to get to Fitz.

19:17.991 --> 19:20.118
- You can't expect us to just...
- It's not up for discussion.

19:20.744 --> 19:23.163
You're agents, I'm the Director.

19:23.247 --> 19:24.456
I brought Hive to this planet.

19:25.082 --> 19:26.291
It's on me to stop it.

19:26.416 --> 19:27.417
Man, if May were here...

19:28.085 --> 19:29.920
She'd give me a very dirty look, yeah.

19:30.587 --> 19:32.714
Get them out, get them home.

19:32.798 --> 19:34.132
But I'm not gonna lose anyone else.

19:38.595 --> 19:41.598
I have to say,
I really enjoy the way you do things.

19:56.029 --> 19:57.698
I'm starting to think clearly.

20:01.326 --> 20:03.120
Adjusting for wind speed.

20:03.871 --> 20:05.455
Setting the last of the coordinates now.

20:06.999 --> 20:10.210
So, uh, when we blow this thing,

20:10.294 --> 20:12.087
three continents worth of people

20:12.170 --> 20:14.548
are gonna end up
looking like these buggers, yeah?

20:17.134 --> 20:18.385
Even the ladies?

20:23.473 --> 20:25.267
Look, I don't wanna seem ungrateful.

20:25.350 --> 20:27.686
I'm pumped to be
changing the world and all that.

20:27.811 --> 20:29.646
But down the road,

20:29.730 --> 20:32.649
can we still look at
tweaking the formula?

20:36.153 --> 20:37.988
I've had some not-so-golden-girls
in my time.

20:38.071 --> 20:39.740
You know, too much booze in the mix.

20:39.823 --> 20:42.701
I'm just trying to manage
your expectations moving forward.

20:42.826 --> 20:43.827
It's done.

20:43.911 --> 20:47.706
Let's tell Giyera
to prepare the containment module.

20:50.834 --> 20:51.919
What is this?

20:52.002 --> 20:53.337
Stowaways.

20:53.837 --> 20:55.923
Tenacious little ratbags, aren't they?

20:57.507 --> 20:58.759
Find them.

21:14.858 --> 21:17.486
The Quinjet, it's here.

21:17.569 --> 21:18.737
Yeah, the Quinjets fly themselves.

21:18.862 --> 21:20.614
Director Coulson
must've called one, too.

21:20.697 --> 21:22.991
They're ducks in a barrel
until they deplane, though.

21:23.075 --> 21:25.452
We need to get to the docking station.

21:29.748 --> 21:31.750
Let's just hope
whoever is on that Quinjet

21:31.875 --> 21:34.211
has an idea about what happens next.

21:35.921 --> 21:37.547
I know exactly what happens next.

21:58.235 --> 21:59.653
You came alone.

22:00.445 --> 22:02.739
I gave the order
for the others to stay behind.

22:03.240 --> 22:05.993
I don't need any more agents
dying from my lapses in judgement.

22:07.494 --> 22:09.746
So you acknowledge that you'll die?

22:09.830 --> 22:11.331
I'm prepared to.

22:14.418 --> 22:17.421
If you plan on blowing this plane up
with both of us on board,

22:18.088 --> 22:19.965
it won't end this.

22:20.090 --> 22:22.134
Millions will still be turned.

22:22.259 --> 22:24.177
Yeah. They won't be handsome.

22:24.594 --> 22:25.721
But at least they won't be swayed

22:25.804 --> 22:27.180
and stuck with your winning personality.

22:27.264 --> 22:28.557
I'll end you first.

22:28.640 --> 22:29.725
And sense of humour.

22:29.808 --> 22:31.268
Look, I'll do whatever it takes.

22:31.768 --> 22:33.103
I crossed a line with you,

22:33.186 --> 22:35.564
a line I vowed never to cross.

22:35.647 --> 22:37.149
I hunted you down and killed you,

22:37.274 --> 22:40.694
unleashing this Ward reboot
nightmare-hellbeast on the planet.

22:40.777 --> 22:43.822
You give yourself too much credit.

22:43.947 --> 22:46.742
Every Inhuman has a purpose.
My fate is to do what I'm doing.

22:46.825 --> 22:47.868
Yeah, yeah.

22:47.951 --> 22:49.995
To crusade for all Inhumans.

22:51.663 --> 22:53.498
Your real mistake was opposing us.

22:53.623 --> 22:55.542
It's ironic.

22:55.625 --> 22:58.253
I actually set out to protect Inhumans.

22:58.336 --> 23:00.714
In fact, lost friends over it.

23:01.298 --> 23:04.634
Even good old Agent Blake said
my policy on the matter made him sick.

23:05.552 --> 23:07.012
You're hiding something.

23:07.971 --> 23:09.765
A few stowaways, yeah.

23:09.848 --> 23:11.558
Probably already made
their presence felt.

23:12.309 --> 23:14.436
I'm just here to offer a helping hand.

23:14.519 --> 23:16.396
Pun absolutely intended.

23:16.480 --> 23:20.150
Or have you given me exactly
what I need to finally defeat them?

23:21.985 --> 23:22.986
Your body.

23:24.654 --> 23:25.697
Oh.

23:27.407 --> 23:30.160
I'll shed this host and take you,

23:30.243 --> 23:32.370
then march down to announce
to the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents

23:32.496 --> 23:35.874
that I finally succeeded
in defeating the great Alveus.

23:35.999 --> 23:38.085
The day is won.

23:38.168 --> 23:41.546
No need to remain concealed
in the shadows.

23:42.339 --> 23:45.258
Yeah. You sound just like me.

23:45.342 --> 23:46.426
Oh, I will.

23:47.511 --> 23:50.222
Once I'm in that head of yours.

23:51.681 --> 23:53.642
I can't wait.

23:53.725 --> 23:56.728
We're two sides
of the same coin, Coulson,

23:58.021 --> 23:59.397
commanders needing soldiers.

23:59.523 --> 24:02.150
The only difference is,
when you give an order,

24:02.234 --> 24:05.445
your followers have no choice
but to obey.

24:05.529 --> 24:08.365
But when I gave my team
the order to stay behind,

24:08.448 --> 24:10.200
they just wouldn't listen.

24:12.077 --> 24:15.122
<i>They got out
right before docking was complete,</i>

24:15.205 --> 24:17.916
<i>climbed along the top of the fuselage
to a maintenance hatch.</i>

24:18.792 --> 24:20.252
I'm just a distraction.

24:24.798 --> 24:26.591
I said I was willing to die, sure,

24:26.716 --> 24:28.218
but certainly don't want to.

24:29.136 --> 24:32.264
I picked up this little move
from my misguided buddy, Blake.

24:32.389 --> 24:33.849
Figured I could get an egomaniac

24:33.932 --> 24:35.725
who'd been alone for 1,000 years
to chat.

24:36.560 --> 24:39.729
Plus, I always wanted to do this.

24:41.064 --> 24:43.441
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only...

24:50.782 --> 24:52.659
He'll be coming soon. Let's go.

24:52.742 --> 24:54.744
We need to get to the cargo bay.

25:20.478 --> 25:21.521
Lincoln!

25:24.774 --> 25:25.817
Ah!

25:28.612 --> 25:29.613
I'll get the med kit.

25:29.696 --> 25:31.489
Put him up against this wall.

25:31.615 --> 25:32.616
Lincoln!

25:34.367 --> 25:35.535
- Is he okay?
- Lincoln!

25:35.619 --> 25:36.828
Stay with us!

25:36.953 --> 25:38.288
Tell me he's gonna be okay.

25:39.164 --> 25:40.290
He'll live.

25:40.373 --> 25:41.791
If there's no internal haemorrhage.

25:42.167 --> 25:45.086
Xylocaine. Sorry. Sorry.

25:45.170 --> 25:46.213
Okay.

25:46.296 --> 25:47.839
Stay with me, okay?

25:47.964 --> 25:49.799
Yeah. You're okay, you're okay.

25:49.883 --> 25:51.593
Hey, look at me.

25:51.676 --> 25:55.180
You should be fine, but you need
to remain as still as possible

25:55.305 --> 25:57.057
until we can get to ground
and properly dress it, okay?

25:58.391 --> 26:01.144
I'm sorry, Lincoln. I'm sorry.

26:02.020 --> 26:04.564
I never meant to turn against you.

26:04.648 --> 26:06.650
- I never...
- I know.

26:06.733 --> 26:09.402
I don't blame you. You weren't yourself.

26:09.527 --> 26:11.571
I am now.

26:14.658 --> 26:17.702
You never came to see me in my cell.

26:17.827 --> 26:19.496
I knew what you were going through.

26:20.163 --> 26:22.249
I think you needed time

26:23.583 --> 26:25.919
to put yourself back together.

26:27.254 --> 26:28.296
Did...

26:28.380 --> 26:30.382
Did I ruin this?

26:31.216 --> 26:32.509
Us?

26:35.053 --> 26:36.429
I just think

26:37.222 --> 26:39.849
we need to work on ourselves
before we can

26:40.225 --> 26:41.351
talk about us.

26:43.019 --> 26:44.104
Yeah.

26:47.357 --> 26:49.859
The stuff that I did, Lincoln...

26:50.860 --> 26:52.654
I can't live with it.

26:52.737 --> 26:54.864
I remember that pain.

26:55.365 --> 26:58.034
Sick with guilt, anger.

26:58.702 --> 27:01.037
I know why you went to face Hive alone.

27:02.789 --> 27:04.708
I tried. I tried to defeat him.

27:04.791 --> 27:06.960
- I did, but I...
- Daisy. Daisy.

27:07.544 --> 27:08.920
I know why you went to him.

27:11.965 --> 27:15.051
Like I said, I've been through it.

27:15.385 --> 27:16.428
I've hit bottom.

27:17.887 --> 27:21.057
I know what it's like
to be so addicted to something

27:22.600 --> 27:25.145
that you'd do anything to get her back.

27:31.568 --> 27:33.361
Hive and his worker bees
will be down here any second.

27:33.445 --> 27:34.571
And then?

27:35.155 --> 27:37.365
Even if we could steal the warhead,

27:37.449 --> 27:39.951
it's probably on a timer by now,
timed with their ascent.

27:40.076 --> 27:42.871
I don't suppose
you came with any concrete ideas.

27:42.954 --> 27:44.247
I have one.

27:44.789 --> 27:48.293
Coulson's gonna need your help.
I don't know what he's planning, but...

27:48.418 --> 27:49.461
I do.

27:50.170 --> 27:51.338
What do you...

27:51.421 --> 27:52.589
He...

27:52.672 --> 27:55.800
He had the Quinjets fly here remotely,
right? So he probably...

27:55.925 --> 27:57.594
Set new coordinates for outer space.

27:58.428 --> 28:00.013
The Quinjet will disconnect
from the Zephyr

28:00.096 --> 28:02.182
and then fly straight up
until it leaves the atmosphere.

28:02.265 --> 28:05.769
If we can steal the warhead
and load it onto the Quinjet somehow,

28:05.852 --> 28:06.895
it'll blow in the...

28:06.978 --> 28:10.065
Vacuum of space and the pathogen
will disperse harmlessly.

28:10.148 --> 28:13.193
Solving at least that part of the problem.

28:13.693 --> 28:16.112
Wait. That's...

28:17.697 --> 28:18.782
Where did you get that?

28:21.117 --> 28:23.328
Daisy. What do you...

28:23.953 --> 28:25.914
- I'm accepting fate.
- No.

28:25.997 --> 28:27.832
Don't try to do this yourself.

28:27.957 --> 28:30.251
Hive will come down here
looking for us.

28:30.335 --> 28:32.212
If the others can keep him occupied,
I'll be able...

28:32.295 --> 28:34.506
No, I remember what you said
about your vision.

28:35.840 --> 28:38.635
Someone will be in that Quinjet
with the warhead.

28:40.178 --> 28:41.262
Only if I have to.

28:41.346 --> 28:43.181
Do not go in there.

28:43.765 --> 28:45.892
That thing will fly itself
if nobody touches the controls.

28:45.975 --> 28:47.143
I know.

28:52.357 --> 28:53.942
I know what you're thinking.

28:55.151 --> 28:56.778
You said you can't live
with what you've done.

28:57.654 --> 28:58.655
But you have to.

28:59.989 --> 29:01.366
Okay?

29:01.491 --> 29:05.620
Promise me you won't try
to atone for your sins

29:05.703 --> 29:07.664
with some kind of sacrifice.

29:10.333 --> 29:12.460
Now all we have to do
is decide who goes

29:12.544 --> 29:15.964
and who stays to hold off a wave
of primates and Hive the Terrible.

29:17.340 --> 29:18.842
Well, I'd like to be in a fight.

29:22.220 --> 29:24.514
Built this damn thing for a reason.

29:27.058 --> 29:28.643
Where's Daisy?

29:29.185 --> 29:30.645
I couldn't stop her.

30:00.383 --> 30:01.426
He's here!

30:01.551 --> 30:02.927
It's time to finish these guys off!

30:31.748 --> 30:32.874
No.

30:33.750 --> 30:34.918
He went for Daisy.

30:57.899 --> 30:59.275
Well, isn't this poetic?

31:01.069 --> 31:02.862
Feels like it was meant to be.

31:02.946 --> 31:04.864
You're easy to find.
I smelled your blood.

31:04.948 --> 31:06.074
Led me right here.

31:06.157 --> 31:08.451
Every Inhuman has a purpose.

31:08.576 --> 31:10.495
Lash saved me so I could end this.

31:10.620 --> 31:12.664
S.H.I.E.L.D. has you
fighting their wars again.

31:12.789 --> 31:14.832
We planned to end wars, remember?

31:14.958 --> 31:16.209
Bring peace.

31:16.292 --> 31:18.336
You mean absolute power.

31:19.504 --> 31:20.588
Well, not today.

31:21.130 --> 31:22.840
The autopilot coordinates
have been set.

31:22.966 --> 31:25.260
This thing is going to outer space.

31:25.343 --> 31:26.427
With you in it.

31:26.511 --> 31:28.096
Ward is still here.

31:28.179 --> 31:30.265
We'll just manually
override the controls.

31:34.435 --> 31:36.145
That's why I had to come.

31:37.146 --> 31:38.815
I shorted the manual controls.

31:57.667 --> 31:59.502
No!

32:10.179 --> 32:12.640
Lincoln. Lincoln, come in.

32:13.558 --> 32:14.684
Damn it, Lincoln! Do you copy?

32:15.518 --> 32:16.728
<i>Lincoln.</i>

32:17.854 --> 32:18.855
I'm here.

32:18.980 --> 32:20.315
What are you doing? This is crazy.

32:20.857 --> 32:22.191
This is my purpose.

32:23.401 --> 32:24.444
I know that now.

32:24.527 --> 32:25.570
Why would you...

32:25.695 --> 32:27.780
I was the only one
who could fry the manual controls

32:27.864 --> 32:30.033
to make sure this worked.

32:30.158 --> 32:33.703
To make sure
you didn't try to do this yourself.

32:33.828 --> 32:36.539
No. No. It's supposed to be me.

32:37.749 --> 32:40.001
I saw the future. This is my destiny.

32:41.711 --> 32:42.712
<i>Yeah.</i>

32:43.379 --> 32:44.756
Sorry.

32:45.214 --> 32:47.050
I stole it from you.

33:09.238 --> 33:10.573
This is not how it's supposed to be.

33:10.698 --> 33:14.285
It should be me
to fix the damage to my friends, to you...

33:15.036 --> 33:17.622
You can't just die for
me like this. It's...

33:17.747 --> 33:19.582
- It's wrong.
<i>- I don't know.</i>

33:19.707 --> 33:22.835
Saving the girl I love and the world
at the same time

33:22.919 --> 33:24.754
feels pretty right to me.

33:34.764 --> 33:36.224
Jet's shaking pretty good.

33:37.809 --> 33:38.935
Lincoln, you're breaking up.

33:39.060 --> 33:41.270
The communication system's dying.

33:42.230 --> 33:43.856
I must have fried that, too.

33:43.940 --> 33:47.276
Lincoln, I can't take it if you...

33:48.444 --> 33:51.614
You can't do this.

33:53.074 --> 33:56.202
I wouldn't have thought so either,
but here I am.

33:56.285 --> 34:00.123
No, you can't. You can't do this.
Not like this. I can't just...

34:00.248 --> 34:03.418
I can't just say goodbye...

34:03.918 --> 34:05.795
I have too much I want to say.

34:07.255 --> 34:08.464
Me, too.

34:10.632 --> 34:12.552
Come to think of it, I just did.

34:12.635 --> 34:15.513
I mean, I tried.

34:16.347 --> 34:17.764
We didn't even realise it.

34:18.433 --> 34:20.143
<i>Realise what?</i>

34:21.185 --> 34:22.437
A moment ago,

34:23.146 --> 34:24.813
<i>that's the first time I said I love...</i>

34:28.693 --> 34:29.985
Daisy?

34:32.321 --> 34:33.822
Daisy?

34:58.055 --> 35:00.683
Try to sway me if you want,

35:01.392 --> 35:04.228
but there's no turning this thing
back around.

35:04.353 --> 35:05.855
I can see that.

35:06.397 --> 35:08.900
I think we're already
gonna share a connection

35:09.358 --> 35:13.738
as we experience the one thing
that's eluded me all these years...

35:18.159 --> 35:19.744
Death.

35:29.545 --> 35:30.588
<i>Turn it back.</i>

35:30.713 --> 35:33.424
Turn it back. Turn it back.

35:33.549 --> 35:34.884
I can't. Remote access is offline.

35:35.009 --> 35:37.845
You have to. You have to.
Help me, Coulson.

35:37.929 --> 35:40.807
Even then, the Quinjet is not designed
to manoeuvre in space, Daisy.

35:40.890 --> 35:42.600
No...

35:42.725 --> 35:44.727
We have to at least try...

35:44.852 --> 35:47.063
He wouldn't want us to.

35:52.026 --> 35:53.903
He's paying for my mistake.

35:54.904 --> 35:56.030
No.

35:58.074 --> 36:00.243
He's paying for all our mistakes.

36:11.629 --> 36:12.880
Well,

36:12.964 --> 36:15.258
I got to see the world.

36:16.259 --> 36:17.593
It's beautiful.

36:19.053 --> 36:20.805
Smaller than you imagine.

36:21.764 --> 36:23.099
Yeah.

36:24.267 --> 36:27.061
I only wanted to make it better.

36:28.396 --> 36:29.438
I know.

36:31.107 --> 36:33.109
To feel a connection.

36:33.234 --> 36:36.070
But you must feel that already...

36:36.612 --> 36:38.614
To sacrifice for them.

36:40.157 --> 36:41.993
With all their flaws.

36:43.619 --> 36:45.288
They're only human.

37:56.025 --> 37:57.568
So, what now?

37:57.860 --> 38:00.196
<i>Hawkeye 665 just located a van</i>

38:00.321 --> 38:01.822
<i>matching the description
of your suspect vehicle.</i>

38:18.255 --> 38:20.633
Hey, I got us some sandwiches.
You know, you should...

38:20.716 --> 38:23.219
They're here. Early today.

38:25.930 --> 38:27.556
Well, you should eat.

38:28.182 --> 38:29.392
I will.

38:30.393 --> 38:32.520
After the meet.

38:32.603 --> 38:34.647
I don't know why you're so sure
today's the day.

38:34.730 --> 38:36.190
I mean, you said the same thing
a week ago.

38:36.273 --> 38:37.942
Just got a feeling.

38:38.067 --> 38:39.068
Okay.

38:40.569 --> 38:43.280
Well, I'm gonna eat.

38:52.248 --> 38:54.083
I wanted to thank you.

38:55.751 --> 38:57.378
The money was too generous.

38:58.045 --> 39:00.423
And to help us relocate...

39:00.548 --> 39:03.217
I was treated as a pariah back home.

39:16.439 --> 39:17.440
Do you like animals?

39:17.565 --> 39:18.774
Yeah.

39:22.111 --> 39:23.279
Your dad made this.

39:24.780 --> 39:27.783
It's a robin, like you.

39:31.746 --> 39:32.830
She's here.

39:32.955 --> 39:34.790
All units move in. Go, go, go!

39:36.125 --> 39:38.294
You've been a real friend.

39:40.921 --> 39:43.632
I actually wanted to introduce you
to a friend of mine.

39:43.758 --> 39:45.009
He has a practise near here.

39:45.134 --> 39:46.927
I think you'd get along.

39:47.803 --> 39:48.929
He likes animals, too.

39:49.472 --> 39:50.681
You're too kind.

39:53.851 --> 39:55.186
I'm just keeping a promise.

40:37.353 --> 40:39.105
Seal the perimeter!

40:39.188 --> 40:40.689
But you won't find her.

40:41.232 --> 40:42.274
Call the Director.

40:42.358 --> 40:44.151
We struck out again.

40:44.235 --> 40:45.611
That'll take us off her trail.

40:45.694 --> 40:48.489
They'd call in the National Guard, yeah.

40:48.572 --> 40:49.865
Where will we be assigned?

40:50.491 --> 40:52.326
Guess we'll have to wait and see.

41:03.170 --> 41:05.005
<i>Welcome back, Dr Radcliffe.</i>

41:05.089 --> 41:08.050
Hold my calls, AIDA.
Today is a special day.

41:08.926 --> 41:10.511
Where's my boy, Fitz?
Did he get the invite?

41:10.594 --> 41:12.263
<i>Leopold had to decline.</i>

41:12.388 --> 41:14.515
<i>He's organising a surprise for Jemma.</i>

41:14.598 --> 41:16.142
Right.

41:16.225 --> 41:18.561
Right. Well, we'll just have
to celebrate alone, my dear.

41:18.686 --> 41:22.606
<i>What will we be celebrating?
Today was your last day of hearings.</i>

41:22.731 --> 41:26.694
Yes, name's been cleared,
and a few stipulations, of course.

41:26.777 --> 41:29.363
But that's not why I am cracking open

41:29.446 --> 41:33.242
a 40-year-old Balvenie.

41:33.367 --> 41:35.953
<i>I don't see anything else
on the calendar.</i>

41:37.246 --> 41:38.998
I had hoped to bring Fitz in on this.

41:39.081 --> 41:41.417
<i>You are fond
of Agents Fitz and Simmons.</i>

41:41.542 --> 41:43.043
That I am.

41:43.127 --> 41:45.171
Put the two of them together,
and you've got a younger me.

41:45.838 --> 41:48.674
Plus, it would have been fitting.

41:48.757 --> 41:50.551
This is based on
an old S.H.I.E.L.D. programme.

41:53.679 --> 41:56.432
Poor kids have had a lot of friends die.

41:57.057 --> 41:58.767
Maybe they didn't have to.

41:58.851 --> 42:00.769
<i>Is that what we're celebrating today?</i>

42:00.895 --> 42:03.606
<i>The inclusion of your new colleague,
Fitz, on this project?</i>

42:03.689 --> 42:06.734
No, AIDA. Today...

42:16.619 --> 42:18.579
Today is your birthday.
