00:46.267 --> 00:47.211
No, it's good. It's good.

00:47.268 --> 00:48.212
It's all right. It's all right.

00:48.269 --> 00:50.840
- Nice out there.
- Yeah.

00:50.871 --> 00:52.612
Are you all right? You
took that hit pretty hard.

00:52.640 --> 00:55.985
Oh, I think I'll survive.

01:01.282 --> 01:03.728
Damn it, Driscoll, stop that!

01:03.784 --> 01:05.456
It's called control.

01:05.486 --> 01:07.124
I'd hazard you could learn some of that.

01:07.154 --> 01:08.531
As could you, Eddie.

01:08.555 --> 01:10.535
You almost injured three
of your teammates today.

01:10.557 --> 01:13.060
The Shamrocks, the Victoria's,
they come at you in waves.

01:13.127 --> 01:14.231
We need to be ready.

01:17.698 --> 01:18.972
Captain.

01:23.304 --> 01:24.647
I said stop that.

01:24.672 --> 01:26.083
He's still smarting after being made

01:26.140 --> 01:27.261
to look the fool on the ice.

01:27.308 --> 01:29.219
- Watch your mouth, Driscoll.
- Easy, boys.

01:29.243 --> 01:30.722
We all play for the same side.

01:30.744 --> 01:32.018
Not all of us.

01:32.046 --> 01:34.026
Driscoll here doesn't play for the team.

01:34.048 --> 01:35.550
He plays for himself.

01:35.582 --> 01:36.782
And you're lucky to have me.

01:36.817 --> 01:38.138
You care nothing for the science

01:38.152 --> 01:39.273
and strategies of this game.

01:39.320 --> 01:40.424
Science my arse.

01:40.487 --> 01:41.693
I skate like the devil

01:41.722 --> 01:43.861
and get the puck past the goalkeeper,

01:43.891 --> 01:45.768
which I haven't seen you doing lately.

01:50.998 --> 01:52.272
Take it easy. Take it easy.

01:52.333 --> 01:53.277
Captain, you all right?

01:53.334 --> 01:54.506
What is wrong with you?

01:54.535 --> 01:56.344
Simpson, man.

01:56.370 --> 01:57.781
Come on, wake up.

02:11.385 --> 02:13.023
Sorry, Simpson. I didn't think.

02:13.053 --> 02:15.966
That's your problem, Eddie.

02:19.059 --> 02:21.369
Looks like we could all use a drink.

02:21.395 --> 02:23.466
The Mongoose and Ferret?

02:23.530 --> 02:26.477
I'll be there presently.

02:26.533 --> 02:27.477
Ow.

02:42.216 --> 02:43.320
Crabapple.

02:45.119 --> 02:47.121
Eddie Driscoll. Good to see you.

02:47.154 --> 02:50.226
Well, aren't you a sight for sore eyes.

02:50.257 --> 02:52.066
Sorry I kept you waiting, Georgie boy.

02:52.092 --> 02:53.628
I had a little errand to run.

02:53.660 --> 02:54.638
Quite all right.

02:54.661 --> 02:56.572
It's on the house, sir.

02:56.597 --> 02:58.406
And my friend here?

02:58.432 --> 02:59.638
Of course.

02:59.666 --> 03:01.737
Not bad for a working man, eh, George?

03:01.769 --> 03:03.112
You know, I read in The Gazette

03:03.137 --> 03:05.413
that somebody by your name
had joined the Wellingtons.

03:05.439 --> 03:07.180
Thank you. I was sure it would be you.

03:07.241 --> 03:09.448
Been here a month.

03:09.476 --> 03:11.922
Look at you now, a big city copper.

03:11.945 --> 03:13.686
And a mystery novelist.

03:13.747 --> 03:15.021
I published a novel.

03:15.082 --> 03:16.652
I brought you an autographed copy.

03:16.683 --> 03:18.924
Now, I signed it to you and Lydia.

03:18.952 --> 03:20.454
I wasn't sure if...

03:20.487 --> 03:22.592
Married last year.

03:22.623 --> 03:24.603
Married?

03:24.625 --> 03:25.763
That's fantastic.

03:25.793 --> 03:27.670
I'm very happy for you both.

03:27.694 --> 03:30.197
Well, what can I say?

03:30.264 --> 03:32.938
I guess the best man won.

03:40.974 --> 03:42.510
His name is Archibald Simpson.

03:42.543 --> 03:44.819
He was found at 6:15
by one of his teammates,

03:44.845 --> 03:46.483
Mr. Jerome Bradley.

03:46.513 --> 03:48.789
I've yet to take his internal temperature,

03:48.816 --> 03:50.557
so I can't give you a
precise time of death.

03:52.186 --> 03:53.563
And the cause?

03:53.654 --> 03:54.632
Uncertain,

03:54.655 --> 03:57.033
but he appears to have suffered an injury

03:57.057 --> 03:59.128
to the back of the head.

03:59.159 --> 04:01.070
According to Mr. Bradley,
sir, the victim was involved

04:01.128 --> 04:03.631
in a dustup after the afternoon practice.

04:03.664 --> 04:05.166
Where is this Mr. Bradley?

04:05.199 --> 04:06.371
He's just outside.

04:06.400 --> 04:07.902
Bring him in, Henry.

04:07.968 --> 04:10.244
Jerome Bradley?

04:10.304 --> 04:12.045
You know him?

04:12.072 --> 04:13.346
When I was younger.

04:18.678 --> 04:20.089
Emily.

04:20.147 --> 04:21.649
Hello, Jerome.

04:21.682 --> 04:24.856
Mr. Bradley, I understand that Mr. Simpson

04:24.885 --> 04:26.865
was involved in a scuffle earlier.

04:26.887 --> 04:29.766
Yes, he took a punch
and bashed his head open

04:29.823 --> 04:30.995
on that post there.

04:31.024 --> 04:33.698
There was quite a lot of blood.

04:33.727 --> 04:35.331
He came to, though.

04:35.362 --> 04:36.932
What time was this?

04:36.997 --> 04:39.375
5:00 or thereabouts.

04:39.399 --> 04:40.679
You think that's what killed him?

04:40.701 --> 04:42.772
If he suffered subdural bleeding,

04:42.836 --> 04:44.747
death could have been
delayed an hour or more.

04:45.939 --> 04:47.612
Who delivered the punch?

04:47.674 --> 04:49.915
Eddie Driscoll is his name.

04:49.943 --> 04:52.423
Where might I find this Mr. Driscoll?

04:52.446 --> 04:54.619
At the Mongoose and Ferret.

04:55.349 --> 04:56.953
Eddie Driscoll?

04:57.017 --> 04:59.122
Pleasure to meet you.

04:59.186 --> 05:00.563
Buy you a drink?

05:00.587 --> 05:03.693
I never say no to another.

05:03.724 --> 05:05.404
Really gave it to those boys from Ottawa.

05:05.425 --> 05:06.802
That I did.

05:06.860 --> 05:07.861
Now, if you'll excuse me,

05:07.895 --> 05:09.568
I'm talking to my good friend here.

05:11.798 --> 05:13.709
Well, been a happy man since I discovered

05:13.734 --> 05:15.543
the true love of my life.

05:15.569 --> 05:17.446
Or should I say, since it found me?

05:17.471 --> 05:19.246
It'?

05:19.273 --> 05:22.152
Hockey of course.

05:22.209 --> 05:23.483
Detective Murdoch.

05:23.544 --> 05:24.887
Oh, please, make the acquaintance

05:24.912 --> 05:26.789
of my good friend Eddie Driscoll.

05:26.813 --> 05:28.952
It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Driscoll.

05:28.982 --> 05:30.427
I wonder if you could accompany me

05:30.450 --> 05:32.896
to Station House number 4.

05:32.920 --> 05:34.831
The station? Why?

05:34.888 --> 05:37.232
I'm placing you under
arrest for manslaughter.

05:46.800 --> 05:49.178
He came at me first, George.
I simply clocked him back.

05:49.236 --> 05:51.341
He was alive when we left him.

05:51.405 --> 05:53.510
It will all get sorted out.

05:53.574 --> 05:55.135
Do you want me to contact Lydia for you?

05:55.142 --> 05:56.815
No.

05:56.843 --> 05:58.345
I won't have her see me here.

05:58.412 --> 06:00.085
Maybe a solicitor, then?

06:02.115 --> 06:03.958
You think I'll be needing one?

06:06.954 --> 06:09.867
The players all agreed to meet
at a tavern after the practice,

06:09.923 --> 06:11.834
but Simpson never arrived.

06:11.858 --> 06:13.360
Who saw him last?

06:13.427 --> 06:14.497
A Samuel Farrell,

06:14.528 --> 06:15.568
but he claims that Simpson

06:15.596 --> 06:17.007
was very much alive and conversive

06:17.030 --> 06:18.805
when he last saw him.

06:18.832 --> 06:21.540
Murdoch, if this is just
a matter of fisticuffs,

06:21.602 --> 06:23.275
don't you think that a manslaughter charge

06:23.303 --> 06:24.475
is a little harsh?

06:24.504 --> 06:26.984
Sir, a man is dead as a direct consequence

06:27.007 --> 06:28.782
of a violent assault.

06:28.809 --> 06:32.621
By definition, that is manslaughter.

06:32.646 --> 06:34.557
If you ask me, they should lock him up.

06:34.615 --> 06:35.559
Why?

06:35.616 --> 06:37.789
Driscoll is nothing more than a thug,

06:37.818 --> 06:39.320
a lowlife ruffian,

06:39.353 --> 06:41.731
and he hardly belongs
in a sport for gentlemen.

06:41.788 --> 06:43.233
This scuffle in the locker room,

06:43.290 --> 06:45.531
who started it?

06:45.559 --> 06:46.867
Well, Simpson, I suppose,

06:46.893 --> 06:48.031
but Eddie Driscoll certainly brought it

06:48.061 --> 06:49.870
to a conclusion, didn't he?

06:53.300 --> 06:55.906
Who's in charge here?

06:55.969 --> 06:58.575
That would be me. And who might you be?

06:58.639 --> 07:00.016
Langston Wallace.

07:00.040 --> 07:02.816
I'm the owner of the Wellingtons.

07:08.649 --> 07:10.356
Manslaughter? That's ridiculous.

07:10.384 --> 07:12.421
Eddie's my best player.

07:12.486 --> 07:13.487
He's your best player,

07:13.520 --> 07:16.228
therefore, he couldn't possibly
have committed manslaughter?

07:16.256 --> 07:18.600
All he did was punch him in the jaw once.

07:18.659 --> 07:20.419
Were you even in the room when it occurred?

07:20.427 --> 07:22.566
I heard enough to know it was an accident,

07:22.596 --> 07:24.576
and Simpson was up,
walking, talking right after

07:24.598 --> 07:25.770
like nothing had happened.

07:25.832 --> 07:27.869
I spoke to him myself.

07:27.901 --> 07:30.381
All points for a jury to deliberate.

07:30.404 --> 07:32.008
You don't understand.

07:32.039 --> 07:33.916
You see, the Toronto Wellies

07:33.940 --> 07:36.079
are about the challenge
the Montreal Shamrocks

07:36.109 --> 07:38.350
for Lord Stanley's coveted trophy.

07:38.378 --> 07:40.551
There's to be an
announcement at a luncheon.

07:40.580 --> 07:42.389
I don't see the relevance.

07:42.416 --> 07:43.918
The relevance is this.

07:43.950 --> 07:45.258
With Eddie, we win the Cup.

07:45.285 --> 07:46.958
Without him, we lose.

07:47.954 --> 07:49.627
I appreciate your position.

07:49.690 --> 07:51.135
I don't think you do.

07:51.191 --> 07:54.468
You see, no team from
Toronto has ever won the Cup,

07:54.528 --> 07:56.735
a situation that your chief constable

07:56.763 --> 07:58.902
has an active interest in rectifying.

07:58.932 --> 08:00.377
A fan, is he?

08:00.400 --> 08:02.243
Our biggest.

08:02.269 --> 08:05.716
So if you appreciate your position, you-

08:05.739 --> 08:06.809
Listen to me.

08:06.873 --> 08:08.147
I don't give a toss which team flag.

08:08.208 --> 08:10.381
Chief Constable Giles likes to fly.

08:10.410 --> 08:11.388
Sir.

08:11.411 --> 08:12.617
And I don't take kindly to threats.

08:12.646 --> 08:15.126
Inspector Brackenreid.

08:15.148 --> 08:16.559
Langston, my apologies.

08:16.583 --> 08:18.995
Your apologies are unnecessary, Percival.

08:19.052 --> 08:21.157
So what exactly is going on here?

08:21.221 --> 08:24.259
I've arrested Eddie Driscoll
on the charge of manslaughter.

08:24.291 --> 08:25.634
On what grounds?

08:25.659 --> 08:28.139
He assaulted Mr. Simpson,

08:28.161 --> 08:31.074
and later Mr. Simpson died of his injuries.

08:31.098 --> 08:33.339
Langston, let me talk with my men here.

08:33.400 --> 08:35.004
I'll keep you appraised.

08:35.068 --> 08:36.240
Thank you.

08:36.269 --> 08:37.509
I'll wait for you.

08:40.407 --> 08:41.681
Sir, under the circumstances,

08:41.741 --> 08:44.313
we're required by law to
charge him with manslaughter.

08:44.344 --> 08:46.187
Bylaw, is it?

08:46.246 --> 08:50.023
Strange how a confessed murderer
can slip freely from your cells,

08:50.083 --> 08:52.290
but a young man who lands an unlucky punch,

08:52.319 --> 08:56.028
well, the letter of the
law simply must be applied.

08:56.089 --> 08:57.625
Are you suggesting it shouldn't?

08:57.657 --> 08:59.330
Do you know for a fact that Simpson

08:59.359 --> 09:00.963
died from that punch?

09:00.994 --> 09:03.304
Dr. Grace has yet to complete
her post-mortem but...

09:03.330 --> 09:06.311
I have to go to an important
luncheon, as does Mr. Wallace.

09:06.333 --> 09:08.711
When I return, you will
present me with proof

09:08.769 --> 09:10.680
that Eddie Driscoll has committed a crime,

09:10.704 --> 09:13.878
or you will release him.

09:22.449 --> 09:24.395
Dr. Grace.

09:24.451 --> 09:25.987
Have you confirmed the cause of death?

09:26.019 --> 09:27.498
I have indeed.

09:27.521 --> 09:30.001
Take a look at this.

09:30.023 --> 09:33.232
This is the injury he received
when his head hit the post.

09:33.293 --> 09:36.706
This is the blow that killed him.

09:36.730 --> 09:39.040
Are you saying he received another blow

09:39.065 --> 09:41.136
after the incident in the locker room?

09:41.168 --> 09:42.738
Based on the bruising,

09:42.803 --> 09:44.976
I'd estimate the fatal blow was delivered

09:45.005 --> 09:46.746
about half an hour later,

09:46.807 --> 09:50.584
which conforms to my best
estimate for a time of death.

09:50.644 --> 09:52.089
And what time would that be?

09:52.145 --> 09:54.091
Approximately 6:00.

09:55.816 --> 09:57.853
Which means this was no accidental death

09:57.884 --> 10:00.091
caused by a locker room scuffle.

10:03.089 --> 10:05.660
Gentlemen, our final order of business

10:05.692 --> 10:06.762
will be to strike a committee

10:06.827 --> 10:08.932
to see if we can find a unity of rules

10:08.995 --> 10:11.441
for each hockey organization.

10:11.498 --> 10:13.774
I pledge that next year

10:13.834 --> 10:15.905
all hockey leagues will follow the example

10:15.936 --> 10:18.883
of our Ontario Hockey Association

10:18.905 --> 10:21.943
and adopt the use of the hockey net.

10:26.079 --> 10:27.759
It's not the rules we should worry about.

10:27.781 --> 10:29.385
It's the damn professionals.

10:29.416 --> 10:30.895
There won't be professionals

10:30.917 --> 10:34.228
as long as John Ross
Robertson is in charge.

10:34.254 --> 10:37.064
But we may lose some of our
best players to the Americans.

10:37.090 --> 10:38.626
Oh, it's our game.

10:38.692 --> 10:40.535
The Yanks will never embrace it.

10:40.560 --> 10:43.871
Besides, if you pay a man to play a game,

10:43.897 --> 10:45.934
who will work the factories?

10:45.966 --> 10:47.036
Hmm.

10:48.401 --> 10:51.541
I have an announcement to
make, gentlemen, if I may.

10:51.571 --> 10:53.050
As you all know,

10:53.073 --> 10:55.314
the other day in a tragic accident,

10:55.375 --> 10:57.651
we lost Archie Simpson,

10:57.711 --> 11:00.783
the revered captain of our great team.

11:00.814 --> 11:03.124
The Iron Dukes of Toronto,
the Toronto Wellingtons,

11:03.149 --> 11:07.928
well, we still have the best
hockey team in all the land.

11:09.990 --> 11:13.597
Yes, yes. And we are going to prove it.

11:13.627 --> 11:17.507
Our newly appointed
captain, Mr. Jerome Bradley,

11:17.564 --> 11:21.740
will lead the Toronto Wellingtons' charge

11:21.768 --> 11:25.306
as we challenge the Montreal
Shamrocks for the Cup.

11:26.773 --> 11:30.084
You mean Lord Stanley's punch bowl.

11:32.145 --> 11:34.989
The closest you will ever
get to the Cup, Wallace,

11:35.015 --> 11:38.622
is when we hoist it over
your head in victory.

11:38.652 --> 11:40.825
We'll see about that, McLaughlin.

11:40.854 --> 11:43.835
Archie Simpson will be watching over us

11:43.857 --> 11:47.202
as we show the Shamrocks
who plays the best hockey.

11:49.996 --> 11:51.703
Well, what do you think of our chances?

11:51.765 --> 11:53.210
Greatly improved.

11:53.266 --> 11:56.145
This Driscoll fellow
is a crackerjack player.

11:56.169 --> 11:58.775
- Mr. Wallace.
- Yes, he is.

11:58.805 --> 12:00.011
Excuse me.

12:05.178 --> 12:07.055
What's the meaning of this intrusion?

12:07.113 --> 12:09.218
Chief Constable, I regret to inform you

12:09.282 --> 12:12.491
that Mr. Simpson's death was no accident.

12:12.519 --> 12:13.964
It was murder.

12:15.555 --> 12:19.662
Mr. Wallace, I'm afraid your run
for the Cup will have to wait.

12:24.397 --> 12:27.071
It's about time, I'd say.

12:27.133 --> 12:29.238
- Mr. Driscoll.
- Yes?

12:29.302 --> 12:30.679
Would you sign this for me?

12:37.310 --> 12:39.347
You gonna give it to the Shamrocks?

12:39.379 --> 12:42.087
- Do my best.
- Move along now, son.

12:42.148 --> 12:44.025
You see that, George?

12:44.050 --> 12:46.428
Your detective Murdoch arrested a hero.

12:46.486 --> 12:47.897
I'm sorry, Eddie.

12:47.921 --> 12:49.662
Detective Murdoch did what was required.

12:49.689 --> 12:52.363
Be that as it may, I
missed a full practice.

12:52.392 --> 12:53.530
Eddie, a man is dead.

12:53.560 --> 12:55.005
It's all very sad,

12:55.028 --> 12:57.235
but it wasn't me that killed him, was it?

12:57.263 --> 12:58.936
Besides, he was hardly good enough

12:58.999 --> 13:00.603
to be worth all this fuss.

13:03.169 --> 13:04.614
Dinner is the least you owe me.

13:04.671 --> 13:07.379
You did, after all, leave me
standing bereft at the altar.

13:07.407 --> 13:09.512
That's not exactly true, Jerome.

13:09.542 --> 13:11.783
I informed you well before the wedding day.

13:11.845 --> 13:14.052
The invitations were already
printed and addressed.

13:14.080 --> 13:15.354
But not yet mailed out.

13:15.382 --> 13:18.420
Nonetheless, all expected
to be dancing with us

13:18.451 --> 13:21.398
at our wedding.

13:21.421 --> 13:24.300
I never meant to hurt or humiliate you.

13:24.357 --> 13:25.392
But there is nothing to be regained

13:25.425 --> 13:27.871
by attempting to rekindle that
which was never meant to be.

13:27.894 --> 13:30.568
I agree, Emily. Let's
let bygones be bygones.

13:30.597 --> 13:34.602
Please indulge me with your
company over dinner tonight.

13:34.634 --> 13:36.978
Just as old friends.

13:37.037 --> 13:39.074
That's what we are now, right?

13:41.708 --> 13:42.982
All right.

13:46.980 --> 13:48.323
Detective.

13:51.885 --> 13:53.489
Dr. Grace,

13:53.553 --> 13:56.796
why are you entertaining
a potential suspect here?

13:56.823 --> 13:58.803
I didn't invite him, Detective,

13:58.825 --> 14:00.236
and I certainly wasn't entertaining him.

14:00.260 --> 14:02.968
Under no circumstances
is a suspect to be allowed

14:02.996 --> 14:04.907
anywhere near evidence.

14:04.931 --> 14:06.569
It won't happen again.

14:09.402 --> 14:10.642
You have something for me?

14:10.670 --> 14:14.174
I believe it may be able to help identify

14:14.240 --> 14:15.685
the murder weapon.

14:15.742 --> 14:20.020
I found these in Mr. Simpson's hair.

14:20.080 --> 14:22.492
- Wood slivers.
- Exactly.

14:22.515 --> 14:24.017
You are looking for a long, thin implement

14:24.084 --> 14:25.586
made of wood.

14:25.618 --> 14:28.656
I believe I know where I
might be able to find one.

14:28.688 --> 14:29.826
Thank you, Doctor.

14:32.358 --> 14:32.391
A hockey stick.

14:32.392 --> 14:33.496
A hockey stick.

14:33.526 --> 14:36.006
Sir, it pains me that
such a joyful apparatus

14:36.029 --> 14:37.633
could be used in such a terrible way.

14:37.664 --> 14:39.473
Not as much as it pains
me that they cleaned up

14:39.499 --> 14:40.534
this locker room.

14:40.600 --> 14:43.137
Have a look at this, George.

14:43.169 --> 14:48.016
Simpson was found here
with his back to his locker.

14:48.041 --> 14:49.679
It would be hard to strike
him in the back of the head

14:49.709 --> 14:50.949
if he was there, sir.

14:50.977 --> 14:52.786
Exactly.

14:52.812 --> 14:55.656
I believe his body was moved here.

14:55.682 --> 14:57.889
Why not just leave him on the floor?

14:57.951 --> 15:00.625
Clearly, the killer wanted
us to think that Simpson died

15:00.653 --> 15:04.123
of his earlier injury.

15:04.157 --> 15:06.694
Sir, look at this.

15:06.726 --> 15:09.138
- What?
- Oh, these skate marks.

15:09.162 --> 15:11.403
It appears that one of the
best skaters in this city

15:11.464 --> 15:14.502
walks like a duck when he's off the ice.

15:14.534 --> 15:16.480
Have you finished labeling
the sticks, George?

15:16.503 --> 15:17.573
Yes, sir.

15:17.637 --> 15:18.911
They're all marked
according to their owner.

15:18.972 --> 15:20.246
Shall we?

15:22.242 --> 15:23.915
What have you got, Murdoch?

15:23.977 --> 15:26.856
Sir, I believe one of these hockey sticks

15:26.880 --> 15:28.416
to be the murder weapon.

15:28.481 --> 15:30.688
The task before us is
to figure out which one.

15:30.717 --> 15:32.219
How are you going to do that?

15:32.252 --> 15:34.732
Through chemi-phosphoro luminescence, sir.

15:34.754 --> 15:37.701
You see, sir, this compound
will emit a blue glow

15:37.724 --> 15:40.068
when it's oxidized.

15:40.093 --> 15:42.266
In this case, the iron and the hemoglobin

15:42.328 --> 15:44.365
will act as the catalyst.

15:44.397 --> 15:47.378
The effect should only
last about half a minute,

15:47.400 --> 15:48.743
but it will be long enough to tell us

15:48.768 --> 15:51.510
which one of these sticks
has been exposed to blood.

15:51.538 --> 15:54.246
Now, sir, if you could turn out the light.

16:00.380 --> 16:01.450
Bloody hell.

16:01.514 --> 16:03.960
It's a tough sport. I'll give it that.

16:04.017 --> 16:07.055
Any one of these sticks
could be the murder weapon.

16:08.755 --> 16:10.035
What are you doing in the dark?

16:14.594 --> 16:15.971
What have you, George?

16:16.029 --> 16:18.475
Sir, McTavish, Danton, and McKenna

16:18.531 --> 16:20.101
were all at the Mongoose and Ferret

16:20.133 --> 16:21.806
between 5:30 and 7:00.

16:21.868 --> 16:25.975
The barkeep vouches for their presence.

16:26.039 --> 16:27.985
Jerome Bradley was at
the Mongoose and Ferret

16:28.041 --> 16:29.122
but left to go to the rink.

16:29.142 --> 16:31.122
Apparently, he'd left his wallet there.

16:31.144 --> 16:34.125
Mr. Bradley claims to have
found the body at 6:15.

16:34.147 --> 16:37.390
He could have arrived sooner,
so he remains on the list.

16:37.417 --> 16:38.452
Fair enough.

16:38.484 --> 16:40.486
Now, Farrell claims that
he stayed after the practice

16:40.553 --> 16:41.623
to work on his wrist shot

16:41.654 --> 16:43.656
but that he was on his way
to the Mongoose and Ferret

16:43.723 --> 16:45.134
when the murder occurred.

16:45.158 --> 16:47.297
No alibi, then.

16:47.327 --> 16:50.968
Finally, Mr. Wallace was
on his way home at 6:00,

16:50.997 --> 16:52.943
but that's yet to be confirmed.

16:52.966 --> 16:54.309
What about Driscoll?

16:54.334 --> 16:55.574
He was supposed to stop by, sir,

16:55.602 --> 16:57.604
to give an account of
his whereabouts, but...

16:57.637 --> 16:59.241
Driscoll had a dustup with the victim.

16:59.272 --> 17:00.615
He might be good for it.

17:00.640 --> 17:02.779
Now, sirs, I know that Eddie
can seem full of himself,

17:02.809 --> 17:04.413
but I can vouch for his character.

17:04.444 --> 17:06.651
You keep your distance
from your pal, Crabtree.

17:06.679 --> 17:08.454
As long as Driscoll remains a suspect,

17:08.481 --> 17:09.960
we can't risk giving him any information

17:09.983 --> 17:11.656
that would compromise this investigation.

17:11.684 --> 17:13.595
Sir, I would never.

17:13.619 --> 17:16.191
Just remember your obligations
as an officer of the law.

17:16.256 --> 17:17.428
Understood?

17:17.457 --> 17:19.266
Sir.

17:22.127 --> 17:23.936
What about Farrell?

17:23.963 --> 17:26.967
He was once a team forward,
right wing, if I'm not mistaken.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.604
If you say so.

17:28.635 --> 17:30.774
Well, when Simpson was brought from Ottawa,

17:30.803 --> 17:32.612
Farrell had to give up his spot.

17:32.639 --> 17:35.079
That would have given him a bone
to pick with Simpson, surely.

17:35.108 --> 17:36.815
Enough to kill him, sir?

17:36.843 --> 17:38.652
It's just a game.

17:38.678 --> 17:41.352
You're not much interested
in sports, are you, Murdoch?

17:41.381 --> 17:43.486
If you were, you'd know
that there's no such thing

17:43.516 --> 17:45.962
as "just a game."

17:45.985 --> 17:48.829
I had no idea you were such an enthusiast.

17:48.855 --> 17:50.835
It's not rugby, but it'll do.

17:50.857 --> 17:53.497
I've always enjoyed playing the game,

17:53.526 --> 17:57.064
but to sit and watch the game being played

17:57.130 --> 17:58.370
seems like a waste of time.

17:58.398 --> 18:00.378
It's a product of our age, Murdoch.

18:00.400 --> 18:01.743
More leisure time.

18:01.801 --> 18:04.247
People looking for ways to spend it.

18:04.304 --> 18:06.147
You should try it sometime.

18:08.174 --> 18:09.346
Could read a book.

18:17.150 --> 18:18.151
Mm.

18:20.920 --> 18:22.661
Enjoy it while you can, Driscoll.

18:22.689 --> 18:24.600
You'll soon be back shoveling horse dung.

18:26.025 --> 18:27.766
Doubt that.

18:27.827 --> 18:29.568
I'm the future.

18:29.595 --> 18:32.235
Eddie, we have to leave.

18:32.265 --> 18:36.771
I'd love to buy a round
for the house before we go.

18:36.836 --> 18:38.577
Aw, you're an angel.

18:38.604 --> 18:39.605
Mm-hmm.

18:41.607 --> 18:43.211
One of the many perks

18:43.242 --> 18:45.279
of being the Wellington's ace in the hole.

18:45.345 --> 18:47.086
Eddie, you're drunk as a skunk.

18:47.113 --> 18:48.114
- Let me buy you one.
- No, no, no.

18:48.181 --> 18:49.751
I'm not even supposed to be talking to you.

18:49.782 --> 18:51.762
- Then why are you?
- Because I'm your friend.

18:51.784 --> 18:55.231
So who does your Detective Murdoch

18:55.254 --> 18:57.860
think committed the murder?

18:59.058 --> 19:01.436
Eddie, you were supposed...

19:01.461 --> 19:02.439
You were supposed to come in

19:02.462 --> 19:03.770
and give an account of your whereabouts.

19:03.796 --> 19:06.276
My whereabouts are nobody else's business.

19:06.299 --> 19:07.300
No one's business.

19:07.367 --> 19:09.904
Eddie, this is a murder investigation, man.

19:09.936 --> 19:11.074
Now, when you met me after that practice,

19:11.104 --> 19:12.105
you were late.

19:12.138 --> 19:13.310
Where were you?

19:13.373 --> 19:14.374
You suspect me?

19:14.407 --> 19:15.784
I don't...

19:16.776 --> 19:18.084
Eddie, we have to go.

19:20.813 --> 19:23.487
What's this? What about Lydia?

19:23.549 --> 19:26.120
We're only young once, Georgie boy.

19:26.152 --> 19:27.961
Time's fleeing!

19:27.987 --> 19:30.092
Have fun while we can.

19:35.828 --> 19:37.136
Excuse me, gentlemen.

19:37.163 --> 19:38.608
A moment of your time?

19:38.631 --> 19:40.474
We're busy.

19:40.500 --> 19:42.605
Oh, it's you.

19:42.635 --> 19:45.309
This lanky chap's a police officer.

19:45.338 --> 19:46.476
Really?

19:46.506 --> 19:49.783
Well, I'm tremendously reassured
as to the safety of our streets.

19:51.944 --> 19:54.288
You're Samuel Farrell.

19:54.313 --> 19:55.917
I am indeed.

19:55.948 --> 19:58.189
Do either you suspect
that anybody on the team

19:58.251 --> 19:59.992
might have a grudge against Simpson?

20:00.019 --> 20:02.367
His name was Mr. Archibald
Simpson, Constable,

20:02.422 --> 20:03.833
and he was as fine a man as you'd meet.

20:03.856 --> 20:06.268
A gentleman if ever I've encountered one.

20:06.292 --> 20:08.499
He'd intended enlisting after season's end

20:08.528 --> 20:11.600
to fight for our mother
country against the Boers.

20:11.631 --> 20:13.508
He was a highly principled fellow.

20:13.533 --> 20:15.012
Yes, unlike your lout friend.

20:15.034 --> 20:16.513
Do you want to know who hated Archie?

20:16.536 --> 20:17.879
It was Eddie Driscoll.

20:17.937 --> 20:18.938
Archie made it clear

20:18.971 --> 20:20.507
that Driscoll didn't belong
in a gentleman's game.

20:20.540 --> 20:21.951
And Eddie killed him for it.

20:22.008 --> 20:23.043
Now, if you'll excuse me,

20:23.109 --> 20:24.782
I have an assignation with a young lady.

20:29.148 --> 20:30.821
Between you and me?

20:35.488 --> 20:36.899
I wanted Eddie on the team.

20:36.956 --> 20:39.732
He made us contenders.

20:39.792 --> 20:41.203
If you want someone with a grudge,

20:41.227 --> 20:43.138
look no further than our new captain.

20:43.162 --> 20:45.506
Good night, barkeep. Same time tomorrow.

20:45.531 --> 20:47.568
Good night, Mr. Bradley.

20:47.633 --> 20:49.408
Bradley?

20:54.140 --> 20:55.847
We should have called
the wedding off sooner,

20:55.875 --> 20:58.321
but I was trying to make everyone happy...

20:58.344 --> 21:00.221
everyone except myself.

21:00.246 --> 21:02.055
Well, I plan to win you back.

21:02.081 --> 21:04.391
Jerome, you promised you
weren't going to bring that up.

21:04.417 --> 21:06.021
And you promised you'd marry me.

21:07.553 --> 21:09.897
So I suppose we're both liars.

21:17.396 --> 21:18.773
You're coming back to me.

21:18.831 --> 21:20.401
It's just a matter of time.

21:20.433 --> 21:22.071
You don't have a choice in the matter.

21:22.101 --> 21:26.208
I'll win the Cup, and then
I'm gonna win you back.

21:26.239 --> 21:27.843
Now, shall we order desert?

21:27.874 --> 21:30.286
I really should be going, Jerome.

21:30.343 --> 21:31.720
I rise early.

21:33.846 --> 21:35.587
Thank you for a lovely dinner.

21:36.215 --> 21:37.216
Good-bye.

21:37.250 --> 21:38.695
Goodbye? I don't think so, Emily.

21:38.718 --> 21:39.924
I'll be seeing you sooner than you think.

21:39.952 --> 21:41.932
Good-bye, Jerome.

21:47.894 --> 21:49.567
Jerome Bradley?

21:49.595 --> 21:52.041
Sir, when the Wellingtons'
first captain retired last year,

21:52.064 --> 21:53.737
Bradley was set to become captain.

21:53.766 --> 21:55.768
Then they brought Simpson in from Ottawa.

21:55.801 --> 21:58.247
Simpson insisted that he become captain,

21:58.271 --> 22:00.547
and Wallace capitulated.

22:00.573 --> 22:03.417
Ah, that must have made Mr. Bradley upset.

22:03.442 --> 22:05.149
So upset that he quit, sir.

22:05.211 --> 22:06.485
He only rejoined last month

22:06.546 --> 22:09.083
when he found out the team was
gonna challenge for the Cup.

22:10.283 --> 22:13.423
But still, that's hardly
a reason to kill Simpson.

22:13.452 --> 22:14.573
Well, think about it, sir.

22:14.587 --> 22:16.624
If Jerome Bradley was captain and they won,

22:16.656 --> 22:18.795
he would be the first ever Ontario athlete

22:18.824 --> 22:20.804
to hoist Lord Stanley's mug.

22:22.495 --> 22:25.669
And, sir, he's had a few
run-ins with the Constabulary.

22:25.731 --> 22:26.835
No convictions, of course.

22:26.899 --> 22:28.606
His high-priced lawyers
have to seen to that,

22:28.634 --> 22:29.908
needless to say.

22:31.804 --> 22:35.013
George, you seem to have
it in for this Bradley.

22:35.074 --> 22:37.452
No, sir, I don't.

22:37.476 --> 22:39.513
Well, perhaps I do.

22:39.579 --> 22:42.253
I know he's well-bred and from
a good family and all that,

22:42.281 --> 22:43.351
but he's...

22:43.416 --> 22:45.657
he sort of lords it over you, doesn't he?

22:50.690 --> 22:51.794
Bring him in.

22:55.094 --> 22:56.630
What's this?

22:56.662 --> 22:58.062
It would appear you have a history

22:58.097 --> 22:59.542
of violence, Mr. Bradley.

22:59.599 --> 23:00.976
I have a history of getting into punch-ups

23:01.000 --> 23:02.035
when I've had a few.

23:02.101 --> 23:04.775
I would like to note that my
client has never been convicted.

23:04.804 --> 23:05.839
You have the nerve to suggest

23:05.871 --> 23:08.283
that this predisposes me to murder?

23:08.307 --> 23:10.378
Did you or did you not quit the team

23:10.443 --> 23:11.945
when Mr. Simpson became captain?

23:11.978 --> 23:13.821
I quit because I could not stand by

23:13.846 --> 23:15.018
and watch the team I loved

23:15.047 --> 23:17.288
sullied by the likes of Eddie Driscoll.

23:18.184 --> 23:20.494
Archie felt the same way.

23:20.519 --> 23:22.399
He and Mr. Wallace almost
came to blows over it.

23:23.522 --> 23:24.865
When was this?

23:24.890 --> 23:27.496
Last week in Mr. Wallace's office.

23:27.526 --> 23:29.206
I don't know what they were shouting about,

23:29.228 --> 23:32.573
but I heard Eddie's name loud and clear.

23:32.632 --> 23:34.009
If anyone killed Archie,

23:34.033 --> 23:36.707
it was probably that low-class farm boy.

23:46.012 --> 23:47.320
You call yourself a lawyer?

23:47.346 --> 23:49.519
Then why do I have to do all the talking?

23:51.884 --> 23:54.888
Bloody toff. I wish he was guilty.

23:54.920 --> 23:56.600
I'd like to know what Simpson and Wallace

23:56.656 --> 23:58.192
we're having words about.

23:58.224 --> 23:59.999
Tread lightly, Murdoch,

24:00.026 --> 24:02.905
or Giles will be all over us like a rash.

24:02.928 --> 24:06.501
Sir, Chief Constable Giles
is an honest policeman.

24:06.532 --> 24:09.741
If he holds any malice for us,
it's because we've earned it.

24:14.707 --> 24:17.051
What were you and Mr.
Simpson arguing about?

24:17.076 --> 24:18.248
Strategy...

24:18.277 --> 24:21.190
proper deployment of players.

24:21.213 --> 24:23.352
Specifically.

24:23.382 --> 24:24.725
Simpson was unhappy

24:24.750 --> 24:28.960
with Eddie Driscoll's place on the team,

24:29.021 --> 24:31.592
as were a number of players.

24:31.624 --> 24:33.228
And why was that?

24:33.259 --> 24:35.466
By all accounts, he was
your most talented player.

24:35.528 --> 24:38.907
Oh, yes, he was that,
but he wasn't one of them.

24:38.931 --> 24:41.605
If I could speak frankly,

24:41.634 --> 24:46.049
most of the players on the team
thought Driscoll beneath them.

24:46.072 --> 24:49.815
They only tolerated him
because of his abilities.

24:49.875 --> 24:52.378
And your captain shared that view?

24:52.411 --> 24:57.292
No, Simpson didn't care
about Driscoll's background.

24:57.316 --> 25:00.889
He was somewhat of a
republican in that sense.

25:00.920 --> 25:02.729
He disliked Driscoll because of the manner

25:02.755 --> 25:05.395
in which he played the game.

25:05.424 --> 25:07.233
And he wanted him off the team?

25:07.259 --> 25:09.398
Well, that's what we were arguing about.

25:09.428 --> 25:10.930
I told him it was none of his business

25:10.963 --> 25:13.773
to be issuing me ultimatums.

25:13.799 --> 25:17.747
But Simpson said it
was either him or Eddie.

25:17.770 --> 25:21.582
Did Eddie Driscoll know that
Simpson wanted him dropped?

25:21.607 --> 25:24.781
Well, he certainly didn't keep it a secret.

25:24.810 --> 25:28.348
Now, I'm due for my supper, Detective.

25:28.414 --> 25:30.860
- Can you let yourself out?
- Yes, of course.

25:30.916 --> 25:31.917
Good.

25:59.845 --> 26:02.155
Aha.

26:02.181 --> 26:05.526
George, bring in...

26:05.551 --> 26:06.962
Samuel Farrell.

26:09.889 --> 26:13.666
I wasn't in Mr. Wallace's office that day.

26:13.692 --> 26:16.866
Then how do you explain
this piece of your stick

26:16.896 --> 26:19.740
that we found on the floor
in Mr. Wallace's office?

26:19.799 --> 26:22.075
I have no idea.

26:22.134 --> 26:24.671
Anybody could have grabbed it,
either by mistake or by intent.

26:26.672 --> 26:29.346
Where were you at the time
of the murder, Mr. Farrell?

26:29.375 --> 26:31.218
As I recall, I stayed late after practice.

26:31.243 --> 26:34.656
I went for a walk and then to the tavern.

26:34.680 --> 26:37.490
Do you always take a walk
after a hard practice?

26:37.516 --> 26:39.826
A stroll cools me down.

26:41.253 --> 26:42.357
Did anyone see you?

26:42.388 --> 26:44.231
I have no idea.

26:44.256 --> 26:47.829
So you have no alibi for
the time of the murder?

26:47.860 --> 26:50.204
All you have is a shard
of my stick, Detective.

26:50.229 --> 26:53.608
I don't see that I need an alibi.

26:53.666 --> 26:55.839
So if you'll excuse me.

26:55.868 --> 26:57.870
Not so fast, Mr. Farrell.

26:57.903 --> 26:59.280
You'll have plenty of time to remember

26:59.338 --> 27:00.749
who saw you strolling
when you're cooling off

27:00.773 --> 27:02.343
in one of our cells.

27:04.009 --> 27:05.750
Mr. Farrell, how tall are you?

27:05.778 --> 27:08.281
- What's it to you?
- Answer him.

27:08.347 --> 27:10.054
I'm 5'8".

27:10.082 --> 27:13.256
My low center of gravity
gives me an advantage.

27:13.285 --> 27:16.095
Hodge, escort Mr. Farrell to the cells.

27:19.558 --> 27:21.299
What were you thinking?

27:21.360 --> 27:25.103
Sir, Mr. Farrell is the
shortest player on his team.

27:25.130 --> 27:27.303
If I can determine the
height of the killer...

27:27.366 --> 27:29.141
It can prove it was him.

27:53.659 --> 27:54.967
Right here, ma'am.

27:59.131 --> 28:01.441
George Crabtree.

28:01.467 --> 28:02.844
Lydia.

28:02.902 --> 28:05.075
Hello, George. It's lovely to see you.

28:05.104 --> 28:06.412
Well, you as well.

28:06.438 --> 28:07.974
What brings you here?

28:08.007 --> 28:09.008
I was asked to make a statement

28:09.074 --> 28:11.020
as to Eddie's whereabouts
at a particular time,

28:11.076 --> 28:12.350
which I've now done.

28:12.411 --> 28:14.357
Of course. So he was with you?

28:14.413 --> 28:15.619
That's correct.

28:15.648 --> 28:16.854
Immediately after practice,

28:16.916 --> 28:19.157
right when poor Mr. Simpson was killed.

28:21.487 --> 28:24.127
Right, well, thank you for coming in.

28:27.259 --> 28:29.330
Lydia, sit down.

28:29.361 --> 28:30.499
Thank you.

28:32.932 --> 28:34.843
I know you and Eddie
have been chumming around.

28:34.867 --> 28:36.710
Well, I've seen him.

28:36.769 --> 28:39.648
George, is he still being true to me?

28:41.140 --> 28:42.710
As far as I can tell,

28:42.775 --> 28:45.551
he's still the same old Eddie Driscoll.

28:45.611 --> 28:47.955
So you haven't seen anything?

28:47.980 --> 28:51.792
Well, all I've seen, Lydia,
is that he has many admirers.

28:51.817 --> 28:53.626
He's always had that.

28:53.652 --> 28:54.892
Mm.

28:54.954 --> 28:58.197
Well, look at you, big city policeman.

28:59.658 --> 29:01.069
An important man.

29:01.126 --> 29:02.696
Important, I don't know...

29:02.728 --> 29:06.232
George, I need you to get me six melons.

29:06.298 --> 29:08.574
Uh, sir, they're out of season.

29:08.634 --> 29:11.308
Right. Six pumpkins, then.

29:11.337 --> 29:12.577
Yes, sir.

29:14.506 --> 29:18.318
Some of my tasks are
more menial than others.

29:20.646 --> 29:21.989
Thank you, George.

29:24.917 --> 29:26.021
Right, then.

29:30.389 --> 29:33.063
The angle of impact is
too high on the skull.

29:38.230 --> 29:39.538
Still too high.

29:41.200 --> 29:42.838
Perfect.

29:42.868 --> 29:45.405
Now, given the difference
between your height

29:45.437 --> 29:47.075
and the height of this pumpkin,

29:47.106 --> 29:49.177
and subtracting that
from Mr. Simpson's height,

29:49.208 --> 29:53.020
"we can conclude that
the killer is 5'10" tall.

29:53.045 --> 29:54.422
Or maybe he was taller than that

29:54.446 --> 29:56.619
but crouching when he attacked.

29:56.682 --> 29:58.389
That's a good point, George.

29:58.417 --> 30:00.294
We can't determine the maximum height;

30:00.352 --> 30:01.854
Only the minimum.

30:01.887 --> 30:04.800
And if the killer was at least 5'10"...

30:04.857 --> 30:07.736
That means Samuel Farrell
can't be our killer.

30:09.728 --> 30:11.469
Bloody hell, I was sure it was him.

30:11.530 --> 30:13.737
No alibi. It was his hockey stick.

30:13.766 --> 30:14.767
Well, at the very least, sir,

30:14.800 --> 30:17.804
this narrows our list of suspects.

30:17.870 --> 30:19.042
So what next?

30:19.104 --> 30:21.880
I still think he was
killed in Wallace's office.

30:21.907 --> 30:24.251
- Do you think Wallace did it?
- Not necessarily.

30:24.276 --> 30:26.882
Mr. Wallace kept his office door unlocked.

30:26.912 --> 30:28.823
It does raise the question, however:

30:28.881 --> 30:31.555
What was Simpson doing in Wallace's office?

30:31.583 --> 30:33.153
What have you, George?

30:33.218 --> 30:35.898
Sir, I was going through
Simpson's effects as you asked.

30:35.921 --> 30:38.458
Amongst the other paraphernalia was this:

30:38.490 --> 30:40.265
A return train ticket to Ottawa

30:40.292 --> 30:42.499
dated the 29th and 30th of November.

30:42.561 --> 30:44.598
That's only a few days ago.

30:44.630 --> 30:46.576
Why would he go up to Ottawa?

30:46.598 --> 30:47.736
Well, I don't know, sir,
but there's something else

30:47.766 --> 30:49.575
written on the back of it there.

30:51.570 --> 30:52.947
John Ross Robertson?

30:54.306 --> 30:56.582
Why, yes, very good, sir.

30:56.608 --> 31:00.522
Perhaps 221 is his
Parliament Hill office number.

31:00.579 --> 31:03.881
Looks like you're going
to Ottawa, me old mucker.

31:05.993 --> 31:08.530
Yes, Simpson did make
an appointment to see me.

31:08.562 --> 31:10.974
He lodged a very troubling complaint.

31:10.998 --> 31:12.409
And that was?

31:12.466 --> 31:14.412
Mr. Simpson maintained
that Langston Wallace

31:14.468 --> 31:18.006
was paying one of his
players for his services.

31:18.038 --> 31:20.575
What would the consequence
be if that proved true?

31:20.641 --> 31:22.245
Immediate and permanent ejection

31:22.309 --> 31:24.585
from the Ontario Hockey Association.

31:24.645 --> 31:26.022
I see.

31:26.046 --> 31:28.856
What was your reaction to
Mr. Simpson's allegation?

31:28.882 --> 31:31.192
I told him that if he wanted
an investigation launched,

31:31.218 --> 31:33.994
he would need to provide
some hard evidence.

31:34.021 --> 31:36.592
- Had he any?
- Nothing but hearsay.

31:36.657 --> 31:38.534
While I knew Simpson to be an honest man,

31:38.559 --> 31:40.163
an investigation at this point

31:40.194 --> 31:41.867
would inevitably have forestalled

31:41.895 --> 31:43.670
the Wellingtons' challenge for the Cup,

31:43.697 --> 31:46.041
for which there's been
so much anticipation.

31:46.066 --> 31:49.172
Yes. So you did nothing further?

31:49.203 --> 31:52.082
I made some discreet inquiries.

31:52.106 --> 31:55.053
Did you find any basis for
Mr. Simpson's suspicions?

31:55.075 --> 31:59.353
I found no cause to
pursue the matter further.

31:59.380 --> 32:01.087
Did he mention the name of the player

32:01.115 --> 32:03.686
he suspected was being paid?

32:03.717 --> 32:05.094
He did.

32:05.119 --> 32:06.860
And?

32:06.887 --> 32:08.525
With all due respect, Detective,

32:08.555 --> 32:09.795
a man's good name

32:09.857 --> 32:11.962
and the reputation of a fine hockey team

32:12.026 --> 32:14.404
is on the line here.

32:14.428 --> 32:17.534
I assure you, I will handle
all aspects of this conversation

32:17.564 --> 32:20.477
with the utmost discretion.

32:20.534 --> 32:23.481
This game is being taken over
by rogues and capitalists,

32:23.537 --> 32:25.574
Detective Murdoch.

32:25.606 --> 32:28.815
I'm doing all in my power to stop it.

32:28.876 --> 32:31.823
I do hope you are on side.

32:31.879 --> 32:33.586
Sir.

32:33.614 --> 32:34.922
The name.

32:37.217 --> 32:39.788
Eddie Driscoll.

32:41.989 --> 32:43.559
Eddie Driscoll is being paid?

32:43.590 --> 32:45.069
That's what Mr. Simpson believed,

32:45.092 --> 32:46.730
but he didn't have the proof.

32:46.760 --> 32:48.762
Perhaps that's why Simpson
was in Wallace's office

32:48.796 --> 32:50.070
the night he was killed.

32:51.165 --> 32:53.304
Well, sir, if he did find
the proof he was looking for,

32:53.333 --> 32:54.654
that would certainly spell the end

32:54.668 --> 32:56.909
of Wallace's grand ambitions for his team.

32:56.937 --> 32:58.348
Well, forget the Cup.

32:58.405 --> 33:00.612
This would get the Wellingtons
kicked out of the league.

33:00.641 --> 33:03.588
Still, sir, it seems
absurd that an individual

33:03.610 --> 33:06.250
would actually pay others to play a game.

33:06.280 --> 33:08.157
It's more and more commonplace, Murdoch.

33:08.182 --> 33:10.526
It's even happening with
the football back home.

33:10.584 --> 33:11.688
Oh, bloody hell.

33:14.254 --> 33:15.597
Chief Constable.

33:15.622 --> 33:18.501
I just had a message from Langston Wallace.

33:18.525 --> 33:21.028
You're investigating a
rumor that the Wellingtons

33:21.095 --> 33:23.769
have been employing a paid professional?

33:23.797 --> 33:24.867
We are, sir.

33:24.932 --> 33:26.332
But you must know what that means.

33:26.333 --> 33:27.971
It would be the end of the team.

33:28.001 --> 33:29.639
Sir, I'm only looking into it

33:29.670 --> 33:31.513
as it pertains to our investigation.

33:31.538 --> 33:34.041
Should Langston Wallace prove
to be innocent of murder,

33:34.108 --> 33:35.781
I see no reason why the allegations

33:35.809 --> 33:37.811
should come to light.

33:37.845 --> 33:39.188
No.

33:39.213 --> 33:42.820
No, if it's true, it
must be brought to light.

33:42.850 --> 33:43.954
'Sir?

33:43.984 --> 33:45.463
There's no greater stain
on the face of hockey

33:45.486 --> 33:47.989
than the specter of professionalism.

33:48.021 --> 33:49.159
Greater than cold-blooded murder?

33:49.189 --> 33:51.362
Yes, I admit that Langston Wallace

33:51.391 --> 33:52.563
has a strong motivation

33:52.626 --> 33:55.232
to try to keep this from getting out.

33:55.295 --> 33:57.832
Perhaps at the expense
of a young man's life.

33:57.865 --> 34:00.402
Get to the bottom of it, Murdoch.

34:00.467 --> 34:03.346
Langston may be my friend,
but if he's broken the law...

34:03.370 --> 34:04.974
Yes, sir, I will.

34:08.242 --> 34:09.380
You see, this is the difference

34:09.409 --> 34:11.581
between us, gentlemen.

34:11.645 --> 34:14.489
I don't let my personal
friendships come between me

34:14.514 --> 34:16.654
and my sworn obligations.

34:22.422 --> 34:25.369
I've been looking at
your ledger, Mr. Wallace,

34:25.391 --> 34:27.099
You make a significant amount of money

34:27.161 --> 34:30.108
charging admission to
Wellingtons hockey games.

34:30.164 --> 34:31.699
I do all right.

34:31.732 --> 34:32.938
You would make even more

34:33.000 --> 34:36.004
if you were the owner
of a championship team.

34:36.036 --> 34:39.609
Acquiring Eddie Driscoll made
that a very real possibility.

34:39.672 --> 34:43.052
I'm already a wealthy man, Murdoch.

34:43.076 --> 34:45.386
I certainly am not in
need of the gate recipes

34:45.411 --> 34:47.255
the team produces.

34:47.281 --> 34:50.387
You deny paying Eddie Driscoll, then.

34:50.417 --> 34:51.395
Of course I deny it.

34:51.418 --> 34:53.625
Professionalism would be the end of hockey.

34:53.687 --> 34:56.065
The gate recipes would all
end up going to the players

34:56.089 --> 35:00.094
as teams tried to outbid each other.

35:00.127 --> 35:02.903
Tell me, how does a man like Eddie Driscoll

35:02.930 --> 35:04.568
pay his room and board?

35:04.598 --> 35:06.077
He has no job,

35:06.099 --> 35:08.306
but he seems to have
plenty of money to spend.

35:08.368 --> 35:11.406
It's not my concern.

35:11.438 --> 35:14.976
Then why does your ledger list a $5 debit

35:15.042 --> 35:17.420
for miscellaneous expenses for every game?

35:17.444 --> 35:19.754
Because I have miscellaneous expenses.

35:19.780 --> 35:21.987
Of exactly $5,

35:22.049 --> 35:23.551
every game,

35:23.584 --> 35:26.394
and only since Eddie Driscoll began playing

35:26.420 --> 35:29.424
for the Wellingtons?

35:29.456 --> 35:32.437
According to the rules of the
Ontario Hockey Association,

35:32.459 --> 35:35.565
payment of a player is strictly forbidden.

35:35.596 --> 35:36.768
If it were to come out

35:36.797 --> 35:38.242
that you have been paying Eddie Driscoll,

35:38.265 --> 35:40.905
you would forfeit your
chances at the Stanley trophy.

35:40.934 --> 35:43.244
Cup, Murdoch. It's a cup.

35:46.106 --> 35:49.349
I believe Simpson stumbled upon this ledger

35:49.409 --> 35:51.753
and realized it was the proof he needed,

35:51.778 --> 35:53.587
and you killed him for it.

35:54.948 --> 35:57.861
Look at me, Murdoch.

35:57.918 --> 36:00.091
Do you really think that a man my age

36:00.120 --> 36:02.464
is capable of killing a young sportsman

36:02.489 --> 36:04.127
in the prime of his life?

36:14.001 --> 36:15.605
So if it's not Wallace, that just leaves

36:15.636 --> 36:17.673
Driscoll and Bradley as suspects.

36:17.704 --> 36:19.650
But Eddie Driscoll had an alibi

36:19.673 --> 36:21.118
confirmed by his wife.

36:22.709 --> 36:23.847
Sirs...

36:23.877 --> 36:25.481
What is it?

36:25.512 --> 36:28.322
Oh, I wouldn't pull much truck
in Lydia Driscoll's words.

36:28.348 --> 36:32.319
I'm quite sure Eddie
coerced her to lie for him.

36:32.352 --> 36:33.990
- Damn it, Crabtree.
- George.

36:34.021 --> 36:35.329
Why didn't you mention that earlier?

36:35.355 --> 36:37.858
Because I think he's an
adulterer, not a murderer.

36:37.891 --> 36:39.461
And I think he had his wife lie for him

36:39.493 --> 36:40.870
because he couldn't get an alibi

36:40.894 --> 36:42.339
from the woman he was actually with.

36:42.362 --> 36:43.466
Bloody hell, Crabtree.

36:43.497 --> 36:45.238
He wouldn't have killed anybody, sir.

36:45.299 --> 36:46.505
I'm sure of that.

36:46.533 --> 36:48.535
Bring him in.

36:48.568 --> 36:51.674
No, sir. Bring the wife in first.

36:53.373 --> 36:54.852
I wasn't lying.

36:54.755 --> 36:58.225
My husband was with me after practice.

36:58.258 --> 37:00.761
He came all the way home after practice

37:00.794 --> 37:06.472
and then went the same distance
all the way back to the tavern?

37:06.533 --> 37:08.206
He was being a good husband.

37:08.235 --> 37:09.737
What's wrong with that?

37:13.140 --> 37:14.710
Why don't you believe me?

37:26.386 --> 37:29.458
You were right, George. She was lying.

37:29.489 --> 37:32.231
Arrest Eddie Driscoll.

37:32.259 --> 37:33.897
Sir.

37:40.334 --> 37:43.406
Eddie, I've been sent to arrest you.

37:43.437 --> 37:44.507
Again?

37:44.571 --> 37:46.346
Just come with me.

37:49.109 --> 37:51.919
Eddie Driscoll, who is this,

37:51.945 --> 37:53.652
this floozy you're with?

37:53.680 --> 37:55.751
You dare call me a floozy?

37:55.782 --> 37:57.625
I... I'm not with anybody.

37:58.418 --> 38:00.091
You were with her, weren't you?

38:02.289 --> 38:03.825
You bastard.

38:03.857 --> 38:05.632
You made me lie for you.

38:07.160 --> 38:09.504
And to you, George Crabtree, of all people.

38:09.529 --> 38:12.203
I thought you were my friend.

38:12.266 --> 38:15.679
I ask you directly, and you
as good as lied to my face.

38:15.702 --> 38:18.114
- Lydia...
- You should be ashamed.

38:23.644 --> 38:25.385
Did you bring her here, George?

38:25.445 --> 38:27.049
No, I didn't bring her here, Eddie.

38:27.114 --> 38:29.458
She must have followed me from the station.

38:30.350 --> 38:33.194
She is a good woman, and she lied for you.

38:33.220 --> 38:34.893
And I tried to believe her.

38:36.823 --> 38:38.359
You better have a good
story as to where you were

38:38.392 --> 38:39.996
when Archie Simpson was killed.

38:46.166 --> 38:48.043
I can't, Eddie. You know that.

38:54.408 --> 38:56.081
Unfortunately for you, Mr. Driscoll,

38:56.143 --> 38:58.680
your alibi no longer holds.

38:59.746 --> 39:02.750
Your wife has retracted her statement.

39:04.985 --> 39:09.229
I think that Mr. Wallace
had been paying you,

39:09.256 --> 39:12.169
Mr. Simpson found out about
it, and you murdered him.

39:12.192 --> 39:13.694
You're wrong.

39:13.727 --> 39:15.206
I don't care who knew I was being paid.

39:15.228 --> 39:17.606
If I don't play for this
team, I can play for another.

39:17.664 --> 39:19.575
They pay people in America.

39:21.001 --> 39:22.344
Better money than I make here.

39:23.437 --> 39:25.212
All right.

39:25.238 --> 39:27.184
Where were you the evening of the murder?

39:27.207 --> 39:29.118
I was with a woman.

39:29.176 --> 39:31.053
- Her name?
- A gentleman doesn't...

39:31.078 --> 39:33.183
Her name, sir.

39:35.849 --> 39:38.762
Felicity Wallace.

39:38.785 --> 39:40.924
Langston Wallace's granddaughter.

39:40.954 --> 39:43.195
But she won't admit to being with me.

39:43.223 --> 39:45.100
What time did you leave her?

39:45.125 --> 39:46.798
I don't remember.

39:46.860 --> 39:49.101
Where did you go after your...

39:49.129 --> 39:50.472
assignation?

39:50.530 --> 39:52.703
To the Mongoose and
Ferret, where I met George.

39:52.733 --> 39:58.274
- Constable Crabtree stated
that you met him at 6:15.

39:58.305 --> 40:00.785
That would have given you 15
minutes to commit the murder

40:00.807 --> 40:02.548
and make it back to the tavern.

40:06.880 --> 40:10.919
I was at a bookmaker's
shop before I met George.

40:10.951 --> 40:12.589
For what reason?

40:14.254 --> 40:16.962
I was betting on myself
to take my team to victory

40:16.990 --> 40:19.470
against the Shamrocks.

40:19.493 --> 40:22.235
My lady friend fronted me
the $50 I was to receive

40:22.262 --> 40:25.334
as a bonus if the Wellingtons won the Cup.

40:25.399 --> 40:27.140
The Shamrocks may be heavy favorites,

40:27.167 --> 40:30.341
but the bookmakers know
nothing about what I can do.

40:30.404 --> 40:34.409
My $50 will soon net me $500.

40:35.609 --> 40:39.580
I care neither about your
game or your wagering.

40:39.613 --> 40:41.593
I'm looking for a murderer.

40:41.615 --> 40:44.994
I didn't kill Simpson,
and that's the truth.

41:02.536 --> 41:03.981
Hello, my darling.

41:04.004 --> 41:06.143
Jerome, you scared the daylights out of me.

41:06.173 --> 41:08.881
Oh, I'm so sorry, my dearest.

41:08.942 --> 41:09.886
Far from my intention.

41:09.943 --> 41:12.321
You're drunk.

41:12.345 --> 41:13.380
What of it?

41:13.447 --> 41:14.619
You can't be here, Jerome.

41:14.648 --> 41:15.991
You must leave immediately,

41:16.016 --> 41:17.017
or I'll have Constable Crabtree...

41:17.050 --> 41:19.291
Oh, Constable Crabtree!

41:19.319 --> 41:20.559
Come and save you.

41:22.055 --> 41:23.728
That's a joke if I've ever heard one.

41:23.790 --> 41:26.396
Now, into my arms, my dearest.

41:26.460 --> 41:28.371
This behavior is unacceptable, Jerome.

41:28.395 --> 41:29.703
Unacceptable?

41:29.729 --> 41:31.072
You have the nerve to say that to me?

41:31.131 --> 41:34.135
I offered to bring a
lowly working-class girl

41:34.167 --> 41:35.475
up to my station.

41:35.502 --> 41:36.845
I have apologized for that.

41:36.870 --> 41:38.543
There's nothing further for me to do.

41:38.572 --> 41:40.483
You can reverse that earlier error.

41:40.507 --> 41:42.680
It wasn't an error.

41:42.709 --> 41:45.053
The mistake would have been
to go through with the wedding.

41:46.480 --> 41:50.656
You ungrateful whore.

41:50.684 --> 41:51.890
Ah!

41:52.819 --> 41:54.594
Take your leave, sir, or
I'll have to arrest you.

41:54.654 --> 41:56.998
This is none of your
business. Now leave us to it.

41:57.023 --> 41:58.434
Get out of here!

42:13.707 --> 42:15.584
Get up!

42:15.609 --> 42:18.852
You're under arrest for
assaulting a police officer

42:18.879 --> 42:20.722
and a lady.

42:20.747 --> 42:22.522
I apologize for the mess, Dr. Grace.

42:31.858 --> 42:32.962
Good morning, sir.

42:34.261 --> 42:35.797
Eddie Driscoll's alibi checks out.

42:35.862 --> 42:38.274
He laid the bet at exactly 6:00.

42:38.298 --> 42:39.800
He wasn't the only one who put some money

42:39.866 --> 42:41.868
on the Wellingtons, sir.

42:41.902 --> 42:43.904
And not just $50.

42:45.605 --> 42:47.448
Mr. Farrell.

42:47.474 --> 42:49.476
You're a gambling man, it would seem.

42:51.778 --> 42:53.621
I've made a few bets.

42:53.647 --> 42:56.594
But you've lost most of them.

42:56.616 --> 42:59.290
In fact, you had to borrow the $2,000

42:59.319 --> 43:01.890
to place on the Cup challenge.

43:01.955 --> 43:04.162
- I'd have made good on it.
- How?

43:04.224 --> 43:05.464
You've squandered all of your money.

43:05.492 --> 43:07.563
You have no profession.

43:08.995 --> 43:10.770
Of course, with ten-to-one odds,

43:10.797 --> 43:12.401
you stood to make a small fortune

43:12.432 --> 43:14.844
if the Wellingtons won.

43:14.901 --> 43:17.677
But that would have required
that Eddie Driscoll play.

43:17.737 --> 43:21.913
And had it been discovered
that Eddie was being paid,

43:21.942 --> 43:23.353
you would have been ruined.

43:26.079 --> 43:27.956
According to your statement,

43:27.981 --> 43:29.961
you stayed after the team practice

43:29.983 --> 43:33.021
to work on your wrist shot.

43:35.822 --> 43:38.325
That's when you saw Simpson
going into Wallace's office,

43:38.358 --> 43:39.598
isn't it?

43:41.094 --> 43:43.096
And you got curious.

43:46.099 --> 43:47.669
Wallace is paying Eddie, Sam.

43:47.701 --> 43:49.476
I got the proof right here.

43:49.502 --> 43:51.448
You panicked.

43:51.471 --> 43:54.714
But then you remembered
Simpson's earlier injury

43:54.774 --> 43:58.381
and realized you could
use it to your advantage.

43:58.445 --> 43:59.947
At first, I didn't think it was you,

43:59.980 --> 44:02.358
because you're not tall enough.

44:02.382 --> 44:06.057
But you would have been, had
you been wearing hockey skates.

44:14.794 --> 44:18.332
That's all speculation.

44:18.365 --> 44:20.038
You have no proof.

44:20.066 --> 44:23.479
And you have no alibi.

44:23.503 --> 44:25.813
Your stick was the murder weapon.

44:25.839 --> 44:29.309
Your motive is clear.

44:29.342 --> 44:33.484
On the face of it, it looks
like murder in the first degree.

44:33.513 --> 44:37.154
But should you confess in your own words

44:37.183 --> 44:42.098
that this was a rash, unplanned act,

44:42.155 --> 44:44.999
you may be spared the noose.

44:47.761 --> 44:50.537
I was way over my head in debt,

44:52.165 --> 44:55.608
and I was counting on the
Wellingtons' win to square it off.

44:58.271 --> 45:00.376
I couldn't afford for us to lose.

45:04.611 --> 45:06.056
I had to.

45:07.781 --> 45:10.091
It would have disgraced my family.

45:12.752 --> 45:15.096
But I've done that now, haven't I?

45:18.291 --> 45:19.793
Game on, lads!

45:22.095 --> 45:23.438
Yeah, George, yeah.

45:23.463 --> 45:24.965
Take us out, Worseley.

45:25.031 --> 45:26.908
Ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo.

45:26.933 --> 45:30.073
Oh, blood hell, Worseley. Watch that, lad.

45:30.103 --> 45:31.138
Right, then, George.

45:31.204 --> 45:32.274
Better mind yourself.

45:32.305 --> 45:33.648
I am going to make you look the fool.

45:33.707 --> 45:34.947
Oh, we'll see about that, sir.

45:39.312 --> 45:40.985
Get it, George!

45:43.450 --> 45:44.428
What was that you were saying, sir?

45:44.451 --> 45:45.486
Nice move, George.

45:45.552 --> 45:46.587
Who taught you that, Eddie Driscoll?

45:46.619 --> 45:48.098
No, sir, I taught him that one.

45:48.121 --> 45:50.658
Although no one could do it
like Constable Deke, eh, boys?

45:58.898 --> 45:59.933
Whoa!

45:59.966 --> 46:01.604
Oh!

46:01.634 --> 46:03.307
Through my legs, Murdoch.

46:03.336 --> 46:04.576
Thank you for letting that one in, sir.

46:04.604 --> 46:05.981
- Oh.
- Don't worry, Inspector.

46:06.005 --> 46:08.417
I'm just letting him build some confidence.

46:09.576 --> 46:11.487
- Wagon!
- Wagon.

46:21.321 --> 46:23.130
So where's Eddie now, George?

46:23.156 --> 46:26.137
Sir, he's in Pittsburgh earning $6 a game.

46:26.159 --> 46:28.833
$6? That's madness.

46:28.862 --> 46:29.772
He thinks he'll earn more, sir.

46:29.796 --> 46:31.673
Maybe up to $10 somewhere else.

46:31.698 --> 46:33.439
- Bloody hell.
- $10.

46:33.466 --> 46:35.309
I doubt that, George.

46:35.335 --> 46:37.144
But still, getting paid to play,

46:37.170 --> 46:38.843
he's a lucky man.

46:38.872 --> 46:40.283
All right, game on!

46:46.613 --> 46:47.853
Oh!

46:47.881 --> 46:49.087
- Yes!
- Oh!
