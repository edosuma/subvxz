00:01.468 --> 00:03.231
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

00:03.303 --> 00:06.966
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous,

00:07.040 --> 00:08.166
In New York City,

00:08.241 --> 00:11.142
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:11.211 --> 00:14.772
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit,

00:14.848 --> 00:16.748
These are their stories,

00:17.584 --> 00:19.745
You're being ridiculous.
You're being ridiculous.

00:19.819 --> 00:22.879
Excuse me? You practically
got into a fistfight
with the parking guys.

00:22.956 --> 00:24.685
So I'm just supposed
to Iet them rip us off?

00:24.758 --> 00:27.022
SUVs cost more to park.
Didn't you read the sign?

00:27.093 --> 00:28.458
It didn't say 45 bucks.

00:28.528 --> 00:31.224
That's an entire dinner
at Fort Lee,
including parking.

00:31.297 --> 00:33.231
Now there's gonna be traffic
on the GW.

00:33.299 --> 00:34.459
I hope you had fun tonight.

00:34.534 --> 00:36.559
MELANIE: You obviously didn't.

00:36.970 --> 00:38.267
Kevin.
What?

00:38.338 --> 00:39.896
The door is all wet.

00:39.973 --> 00:41.736
Damn it, I just had it washed.

00:42.475 --> 00:44.773
What did you get on my car?

00:44.844 --> 00:46.778
I don't know.
I got a Ieaky pipe up there.

00:46.846 --> 00:48.871
I don't know.
MELANIE: What is this?

00:49.816 --> 00:51.044
Oh, God!

00:52.118 --> 00:53.983
(POLICE SIREN WAILING)

00:55.989 --> 00:57.820
That was quick from Queens.

00:57.891 --> 00:59.552
I stayed in the city tonight.

00:59.859 --> 01:00.985
What do we know?

01:01.061 --> 01:02.926
Parking attendant found her
on the second Ievel,

01:02.996 --> 01:04.462
naked from the waist down.

01:04.531 --> 01:06.863
IDed from her purse.
Nicole Manning.

01:06.933 --> 01:09.367
There's no robbery.
60 bucks cash
Ieft in her wallet.

01:09.436 --> 01:10.562
How's she doing?

01:10.637 --> 01:12.628
She's alive,
but it's a real mess.

01:13.173 --> 01:14.731
She conscious?
EMT 1: In and out.

01:14.808 --> 01:16.969
Got bashed in her head
pretty good.

01:17.043 --> 01:19.409
We got a description
on the perp?
Nothing yet.

01:19.479 --> 01:20.605
EMT 2: Better get one quick.

01:20.680 --> 01:22.341
I'II ride.
STABLER: Okay.

01:25.285 --> 01:27.344
CSU says condition
of her blood at the scene

01:27.420 --> 01:29.854
Iooks Iike she was attacked
minutes before she was found.

01:29.923 --> 01:31.788
How many stab wounds?

01:34.127 --> 01:36.493
She wasn't stabbed, Detective.

01:37.030 --> 01:38.725
Pressure's dropping.
EMT 2:
Come on, Nicole, stay with us.

01:38.798 --> 01:42.632
Two Iarge-bore IVs,
02, 15 Iiters,
non-rebreather mask.

01:42.702 --> 01:45.193
She's C-spined,
sinus tach at 150.

01:45.271 --> 01:47.296
Nicole, did you get
a Iook at him?

01:47.373 --> 01:49.204
EMT 2: She's seizing.
Two of Ativan.

01:49.275 --> 01:51.869
Trauma to the head,
pupils equal,
round and reactive.

01:51.945 --> 01:54.539
Patient sustained
massive abdominal trauma.

01:54.614 --> 01:57.174
Looks Iike emergency
C-section to me.

01:57.250 --> 01:58.945
This woman was pregnant?

01:59.018 --> 02:01.509
EMT 2: No pulse. Start CPR.

02:02.388 --> 02:04.754
Any sign of the baby?
Not yet.

02:04.891 --> 02:06.984
What the hell
did he do with it?

02:07.060 --> 02:10.257
Sick son of a bitch
must have taken it with him.

02:12.000 --> 02:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:59.112 --> 03:01.307
Cut was made with a dull
or serrated blade.

03:01.381 --> 03:04.646
Head trauma, multiple
contusions around the abdomen,
Iike she'd been kicked.

03:04.717 --> 03:05.945
Anything from the rape kit?

03:06.019 --> 03:07.452
Positive for fluids.

03:07.520 --> 03:09.249
What are her chances?
Not good.

03:09.322 --> 03:11.290
Developed an amniotic
embolism.

03:11.357 --> 03:14.087
CIots in her Iungs
cut off oxygen to the brain.

03:14.160 --> 03:15.593
Any word on the baby?
Not yet.

03:15.662 --> 03:17.095
Guy could have
dumped that body anywhere.

03:17.163 --> 03:18.687
Or kidnapped it.
Kidnapped?

03:18.765 --> 03:20.323
Well, at this age,
it's viable.

03:20.400 --> 03:22.493
Mother's at 28 weeks,
baby was normal weight,

03:22.569 --> 03:23.866
no apparent complications.

03:23.937 --> 03:26.804
You think it's possible
this baby could be out there
somewhere alive?

03:26.873 --> 03:29.273
It's possible,
but not for Iong.

03:29.442 --> 03:33.003
She was by herself.
I didn't even think
to go with her.

03:33.079 --> 03:34.307
This is a safe neighborhood.

03:34.380 --> 03:35.745
Who else was up there?

03:35.815 --> 03:37.214
Usually nobody but me.

03:37.283 --> 03:38.580
Then why was she?

03:38.651 --> 03:41.677
Well, Mrs. Manning,
she's a monthly.
She always gets her own car.

03:41.754 --> 03:45.019
Okay, did you hear anything?
Maybe you hear
a woman screaming?

03:45.091 --> 03:47.025
No, no, no. I would have
checked on that.

03:47.093 --> 03:48.822
What about someone
Ieaving the building?

03:48.895 --> 03:51.056
Maybe carrying a bag
or something wrapped up
in a coat?

03:51.130 --> 03:53.655
No. No, no.

03:53.733 --> 03:55.963
But there's another way down
from the second floor.

03:56.035 --> 03:59.095
The stairs,
they Iead onto the back alley.

03:59.639 --> 04:01.539
Hey, what's the Iatest?

04:02.242 --> 04:05.803
Still waiting
to talk to the husband.
Any Ieads on the baby?

04:05.878 --> 04:08.642
Got every available cop out
canvassing the neighborhood.

04:08.715 --> 04:10.182
That's him.

04:10.650 --> 04:13.084
Whoever did this,
it was personal.

04:14.420 --> 04:16.285
Can't rule him out.

04:18.558 --> 04:21.356
We were supposed to meet
for dinner at 7:00.

04:21.427 --> 04:24.055
I waited at the restaurant.

04:24.130 --> 04:28.362
She's usually Iate,
so I didn't worry right away.

04:28.935 --> 04:30.562
CRAGEN:
What about before that?

04:30.637 --> 04:33.231
I was in a session
with a patient.

04:33.873 --> 04:37.741
You're a doctor?
Psychiatrist.
My practice is in midtown.

04:38.745 --> 04:42.613
Dr. Manning,
there's no easy way
to ask you this.

04:42.682 --> 04:46.516
Were you intimate
with your wife
during the past 24 hours?

04:47.086 --> 04:49.020
No. Why?

04:49.289 --> 04:52.281
We think that your wife
may have been assaulted.

04:52.358 --> 04:55.327
We'd Iike to ask
for a blood sample from you.

04:55.928 --> 04:58.158
Of course. Anything you need.

04:59.766 --> 05:02.030
What did you do when your wife
didn't show up
at the restaurant?

05:02.101 --> 05:06.561
I tried calling her.
And, after an hour,
I went home.

05:07.206 --> 05:10.642
BENSON: Can you think of
any reason that somebody
would want to hurt Nicole?

05:10.710 --> 05:12.302
No.

05:12.378 --> 05:15.779
Nicole was a good person.
She is.

05:15.848 --> 05:17.213
Nicole is a good person.

05:17.283 --> 05:20.616
The doctor said there's still
a chance she'II recover.

05:27.293 --> 05:30.694
PIenty of prints off her car.
After we rule out
the parking staff,

05:30.763 --> 05:35.723
the victim's friends
and family, and every valet
in the city, who knows?

05:35.802 --> 05:38.270
We just might get Iucky.
This car's for sale.

05:38.338 --> 05:41.034
We're not gonna get too Iucky
if she had people
test-driving it.

05:41.107 --> 05:42.574
What about signs of the baby?

05:42.642 --> 05:44.507
Lot of blood.
Don't know whose yet.

05:44.577 --> 05:47.842
No placenta or cord.
Took everything with him.

05:47.914 --> 05:50.849
Looks Iike he got in
and out through there.

05:52.151 --> 05:53.618
CIeaned up before he Ieft.

05:53.686 --> 05:57.178
With those slimy antibacterial
hand wipes. He came prepared.

05:57.256 --> 05:59.247
He gets rid of the blood,

06:00.093 --> 06:03.756
Ieaves out that door.
It's Iike nothing
ever happened.

06:04.430 --> 06:05.590
But why take the baby?

06:05.665 --> 06:07.064
Maybe that was the reason
for the attack.

06:07.133 --> 06:10.694
He didn't want the woman dead.
He wanted her to suffer.

06:12.271 --> 06:15.172
BENSON: Husband's
credit card records confirm
he was at the restaurant.

06:15.241 --> 06:18.039
Cell phone records coincide
with the calls he made
Iooking for his wife.

06:18.111 --> 06:20.341
Preliminary on the rape kit
rules him out anyway.

06:20.413 --> 06:22.677
Husband's AB-positive,
perp's O-negative.

06:22.749 --> 06:25.081
What did Latent turn up
in the victim's car?

06:25.151 --> 06:28.245
Just got a solid hit from
prints, interior and exterior.

06:28.354 --> 06:29.378
Kyle Novacek.

06:29.455 --> 06:30.479
Not a complete Iunatic,

06:30.556 --> 06:33.184
but did time for assault three
and heroin possession.

06:33.259 --> 06:35.523
Don't really see that kind
of violence with heroin users

06:35.595 --> 06:38.462
unless somebody slipped him a
hotshot and mixed in some PCP,

06:38.531 --> 06:39.828
guy could've gone psycho.

06:39.899 --> 06:42.129
Well, get on him. That baby
might still be alive.

06:42.201 --> 06:45.500
The victim is an RN
at a methadone clinic.
That can't be a coincidence.

06:45.571 --> 06:48.005
But might be the connection
between them.

06:48.074 --> 06:49.974
Hey, Maureen.
Hey.

06:50.676 --> 06:53.008
Dad?
Sweetheart, what's wrong?

06:53.813 --> 06:55.838
Can I talk to you, please?

06:56.816 --> 06:57.942
Come on.

06:58.017 --> 06:59.609
Go ahead. Use my office.

07:03.322 --> 07:07.156
So we'II hit
the methadone clinic. Novacek
could have been a client.

07:07.226 --> 07:09.023
We talk to area hospitals?

07:09.095 --> 07:12.394
No premature newborns
admitted yet, but
the hospitals are on alert.

07:12.465 --> 07:13.864
Well, what did the search
turn up?

07:13.933 --> 07:15.594
The neighborhood canvass
was a complete bust.

07:15.668 --> 07:19.661
Nothing at the airports,
bus terminals. Still waiting
to hear on the PATH trains.

07:19.739 --> 07:23.869
We'II have to
widen the search.
I'II use another phone.

07:34.720 --> 07:36.881
So how's school going,
Maureen?
It's fine.

07:36.956 --> 07:38.856
Yeah? You get your college
applications out yet?

07:38.925 --> 07:41.120
Pretty much.
You're gonna be Iate.

07:41.194 --> 07:43.662
Okay. Bye, OIivia.

07:45.498 --> 07:48.490
Everything okay?
Yeah.

07:49.469 --> 07:50.800
You ready?

07:57.810 --> 08:01.211
MUNCH: Kyle Novacek?
What, I'm on every
cop's Iist now?

08:01.280 --> 08:03.009
Third time this year
with you guys.

08:03.082 --> 08:06.108
You wanna be Ieft alone,
don't stab your smack dealer
in the forearm.

08:06.185 --> 08:08.312
I'm working steady now.
I'm clean.

08:08.387 --> 08:10.514
Got nothing to do
with that Iife anymore.
That all you wanna know?

08:10.590 --> 08:13.457
Not even close.
Where were you Iast night?

08:14.293 --> 08:15.988
I take a class
at Brooklyn College.

08:16.062 --> 08:17.290
A man of intellect.

08:17.363 --> 08:20.491
What time's the class start?
7:00. Before that,
here till 6:00.

08:20.566 --> 08:23.831
What kind of car you drive?
I don't. Car died Iast week.

08:24.170 --> 08:26.866
That's a shame.
Looking for a new one?

08:26.939 --> 08:29.100
Gold Ford parked in a garage
a few blocks away,

08:29.175 --> 08:31.405
some interesting fingerprints.

08:32.078 --> 08:35.514
That's the car I Iooked at.
I saw a sign in the window.

08:35.581 --> 08:37.344
The woman Iet me take it
for a drive Iast week.

08:37.416 --> 08:39.543
What, did somebody steal it?
FIN: How'd the program go?

08:39.619 --> 08:41.313
What program?
The methadone treatment.

08:41.386 --> 08:42.785
You know, sometimes they don't
give you enough.

08:42.855 --> 08:44.379
You need a Iittle more
to make it through the day.

08:44.457 --> 08:47.358
What's this all about?
Did she get hurt?

08:47.426 --> 08:49.291
Do you even
remember Iast night
or were you too Ioaded?

08:49.362 --> 08:53.230
Look, I already told you,
I saw the car once.
I haven't been back since.

08:53.299 --> 08:54.459
Where is it?
What?

08:54.534 --> 08:56.900
The baby.
What the hell
you talking about?

08:56.969 --> 08:59.563
It's alive, you can still
get out of this
without a broken neck.

08:59.639 --> 09:02.335
You telling me
somebody hurt that baby?
Take the DNA test.

09:02.408 --> 09:05.241
You didn't touch her,
we Ieave you alone.

09:08.781 --> 09:11.716
I don't have to do that.
Sound Iike a guilty man to me,
Novacek.

09:11.784 --> 09:14.344
I just know the way
you guys operate.

09:14.420 --> 09:18.481
If you had anything on me,
my ass would be in the back
of your car already, right?

09:18.558 --> 09:19.547
Anything else?

09:19.625 --> 09:20.717
Count on it.

09:27.266 --> 09:30.064
CAROL: You know methadone
client Iists are confidential.

09:30.136 --> 09:33.003
We give their names out
to police, they never come in
for treatment.

09:33.072 --> 09:35.302
How about I show you
the ER photos
they took of Nicole Manning?

09:35.374 --> 09:37.672
That change your mind?
Her baby might still be alive,

09:37.743 --> 09:40.007
but we are running
out of time.
I wish I could help.

09:40.079 --> 09:43.014
Well, you do have armed guards
and surveillance videos.

09:43.082 --> 09:45.107
I'm sure not all of your
clients are perfect angels.

09:45.184 --> 09:46.776
Have any of your employees
ever been harassed?

09:46.852 --> 09:50.083
On a daily basis,
but nothing overtly violent.

09:50.156 --> 09:51.418
BENSON: What about
in the neighborhood?

09:51.490 --> 09:53.583
I'd imagine this place
attracts some real winners.

09:53.659 --> 09:56.526
Actually, the only person
we've had a problem with
is another nurse,

09:56.596 --> 09:57.585
Erin Sena.

09:57.663 --> 10:00.427
Nicole found out
she'd been diverting
methadone for herself.

10:00.499 --> 10:02.364
What happened to Erin?

10:03.469 --> 10:06.233
I'm required to report
all incidents to the police.

10:06.305 --> 10:10.002
She was arrested.
She Iost her job
and her nursing Iicense.

10:11.010 --> 10:12.375
BENSON: Nice place.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.603
I cleaned up
especially for you.

10:14.680 --> 10:16.648
Your boyfriend
doesn't mind the mess?

10:16.716 --> 10:18.809
Who says I've got a boyfriend?

10:19.385 --> 10:22.582
Come on, a girl Iike you.
I'm sure you have a few.

10:24.390 --> 10:27.791
You coming on to me?
I'm into that.

10:28.661 --> 10:30.390
Your friend can watch.
AII right.

10:30.463 --> 10:34.331
Why don't we start by having
you sit down and answer
a few of my questions?

10:34.400 --> 10:35.389
Okay?

10:35.935 --> 10:39.268
Nicole Manning.
You seen her Iately?

10:39.338 --> 10:40.362
Yeah.

10:40.973 --> 10:43.305
We hang out all the time
and have tea.

10:43.376 --> 10:44.968
BENSON: She screwed you over,
didn't she?

10:45.044 --> 10:48.980
Got arrested, Iost your job.
She's the reason
that your Iife sucks, right?

10:49.048 --> 10:51.312
So?
This is what I'm thinking.

10:51.384 --> 10:54.410
You and your boyfriend follow
Nicole Manning
into the parking garage.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.682
You have a fight,
it gets a Iittle out of hand,

10:56.756 --> 10:59.350
your boyfriend goes crazy,
not your fault.

10:59.425 --> 11:01.450
I don't have a boyfriend.

11:02.895 --> 11:05.295
You have to Ieave now.

11:05.498 --> 11:07.728
STABLER: What's that?
None of your business.

11:07.800 --> 11:09.768
Do you have a son, Erin?

11:11.103 --> 11:12.661
They took him away from me.

11:12.738 --> 11:13.762
They who?

11:15.007 --> 11:17.441
Two cops and some bitch
from Social Services

11:17.510 --> 11:20.741
think they know
how to take care of my own son
better than me.

11:20.813 --> 11:22.474
Must have been jealous
of Nicole.

11:22.548 --> 11:26.712
The woman who took everything
from you, and now she's
having her own baby.

11:26.786 --> 11:28.083
Get out.

11:28.154 --> 11:29.849
You still using? Yeah, we are.

11:29.922 --> 11:34.052
Look, I gotta tell you
that no agency is gonna
give a junky back her kid.

11:34.126 --> 11:35.286
Yeah? Screw you.

11:35.361 --> 11:37.420
That baby needs to be
in a hospital, Erin.

11:37.496 --> 11:39.430
Now, we can help you.

11:39.498 --> 11:40.897
No, you can't.

11:41.233 --> 11:43.633
Nicole pissed off
the wrong person.
Look what happened to her.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.500
Who'd she piss off?

11:46.672 --> 11:49.197
I don't know.
Yeah, I think you do.

11:50.209 --> 11:54.612
Only thing I know is
Nicole asked for it,
and she got what she deserved.

11:55.781 --> 11:57.942
I had nothing to do with it.

11:58.050 --> 12:00.382
Now, get out.

12:09.328 --> 12:11.956
Someone scared the hell
out of her to shut her up.

12:12.031 --> 12:13.225
Partner in crime.

12:13.299 --> 12:15.631
We need to get back in there
and search for signs
of that baby.

12:15.701 --> 12:17.828
Right. Stabler.

12:20.372 --> 12:21.771
We're on it.

12:23.776 --> 12:25.573
CRAGEN:
Take him down to the shelter.
Get him something to eat.

12:25.644 --> 12:27.703
Yeah, thank you very much.

12:29.448 --> 12:32.076
Homeless guy reported it.
Says he didn't
see anybody around.

12:32.151 --> 12:33.812
Where?
Dumpster.

12:42.561 --> 12:45.155
We positive
it's the Manning baby?
Right size.

12:45.231 --> 12:47.665
Decomposition fits
the time frame.

12:50.136 --> 12:51.831
Sorry, Detectives.

12:56.408 --> 12:57.841
What was it?

12:59.211 --> 13:00.769
Little boy.

13:09.054 --> 13:12.888
MANNING: I should probably
make some arrangements,
I don't know.

13:12.958 --> 13:15.950
Am I supposed to get
a birth certificate issued
first before...

13:16.028 --> 13:17.427
You don't have to do anything
right now.

13:17.496 --> 13:20.397
Actually, the Medical Examiner
is gonna need a Iittle time
to investigate.

13:20.466 --> 13:22.934
Well, I'd Iike to take care
of things before she wakes up.

13:23.002 --> 13:25.266
We know this is
a very difficult time for you,

13:25.337 --> 13:27.168
but we need to ask you
about another nurse

13:27.239 --> 13:29.799
that your wife worked with.
Erin Sena.

13:31.177 --> 13:32.576
Oh, yeah, I know the name.

13:32.645 --> 13:36.741
She tried to get Nicole
to testify on her behalf
at some hearing.

13:36.816 --> 13:39.307
I think the state was trying
to take away her son.

13:39.385 --> 13:41.046
Did she testify?
No.

13:41.120 --> 13:44.021
No, Nicole thought
it was Iudicrous
of the girl to even ask.

13:44.089 --> 13:45.716
So what happened?

13:46.292 --> 13:48.590
Well, she screamed
at our answering machine
a few times,

13:48.661 --> 13:50.492
and I wanted to
call the police,

13:51.997 --> 13:53.430
but Nicole
wouldn't hear of it.

13:53.499 --> 13:55.899
She thought
it was unnecessary.

13:55.968 --> 13:57.196
She doing any better?

14:01.307 --> 14:03.537
They performed a hysterectomy.

14:04.844 --> 14:08.041
How do I tell her that
we'II never have a family?

14:12.284 --> 14:15.048
WARNER:
Depressed skull fractures
along the right temporal Iobe,

14:15.120 --> 14:16.985
extensive contusions.

14:17.056 --> 14:20.924
Cause of death was a subdural
hematoma resulting from
blows to the head.

14:20.993 --> 14:23.518
Whoever did it did not want
this baby to Iive.

14:23.596 --> 14:26.258
Perp kicked the mother
before removing the baby.

14:26.332 --> 14:28.323
Could the head trauma
be from the beating?

14:28.400 --> 14:32.200
No way to tell if the injuries
were sustained
in- or ex-utero.

14:32.271 --> 14:36.401
But once the fetus was
aborted, no apparent effort
was made to save it.

14:38.844 --> 14:40.368
How Iong did he Iive?

14:40.446 --> 14:42.311
Still trying
to determine that.

14:42.481 --> 14:44.881
If there's a God,
it wasn't Iong.

14:45.985 --> 14:48.317
Kyle Novacek's alibi
cleared him.

14:48.387 --> 14:50.412
That Ieaves Erin Sena
as our only suspect,

14:50.489 --> 14:53.185
assuming we can find the man
who was her partner in crime.

14:53.259 --> 14:56.023
I want options. Now, how else
can we get to her?

14:56.095 --> 14:57.255
Probation violation.

14:57.329 --> 14:59.024
She was higher than a kite
when we talked to her.

14:59.098 --> 15:00.429
We haul her in
for a drug test.

15:00.499 --> 15:03.332
Judge made random testing
a requirement
for her probation.

15:03.402 --> 15:05.393
She fails the test,
we got Ieverage
to make her talk.

15:05.471 --> 15:06.995
Now all we got to do
is find her.

15:07.072 --> 15:08.471
She in methadone treatment?

15:08.540 --> 15:11.202
Her PO says she's a client
at Tenth Avenue
where she used to work.

15:11.277 --> 15:15.111
Well, that's one appointment
a heroin addict's
always gonna keep.

15:17.716 --> 15:19.206
You think we missed her?

15:19.285 --> 15:20.650
She needs her fix.

15:21.654 --> 15:24.987
Could've gotten it
this morning.
No, she's coming.

15:25.057 --> 15:27.287
You want to Ieave, go ahead.

15:27.359 --> 15:32.296
Or you could just stop being
a jerk and tell me what
the hell's going on with you.

15:35.334 --> 15:37.063
This about Maureen?

15:38.203 --> 15:42.469
I screwed up.
I didn't send in a check
for the Columbia application.

15:43.242 --> 15:44.903
Is it too Iate?

15:46.111 --> 15:47.669
I don't know.

15:47.980 --> 15:49.743
EIIiot, what is this?

15:50.950 --> 15:52.747
I've been distracted.

15:55.554 --> 15:56.919
That's her.

16:00.092 --> 16:01.218
Where you off to?

16:01.293 --> 16:02.817
Oh, just Iet me go in.

16:02.895 --> 16:07.594
Right after your drug test.
Oh, please, just Iet me...
Let me just go in!

16:12.738 --> 16:14.763
You tested positive
for heroin.

16:14.840 --> 16:16.967
Fine. Arrest me.

16:17.042 --> 16:19.442
There's no rush, really.
We got, what, 24 hours?

16:19.511 --> 16:20.569
STABLER: Yeah, give or take.

16:20.646 --> 16:23.911
I really, really need
to get out of here, okay?

16:23.983 --> 16:26.178
Yeah, what happened
to your face?

16:26.251 --> 16:27.275
I got hit.

16:27.753 --> 16:29.880
Someone's fist, Iooks Iike.

16:31.790 --> 16:34.588
Can I have a soda?
Can you do that?

16:34.660 --> 16:36.719
Soon as you tell us
who you've been
hiding from, sure.

16:36.795 --> 16:38.023
No, no. No way.

16:38.097 --> 16:39.860
Then you're going down
for everything, Erin.

16:39.932 --> 16:41.365
Cutting Nicole
and killing her baby.

16:41.433 --> 16:43.230
STABLER: Trained nurse.
You knew exactly
what you were doing.

16:43.302 --> 16:44.462
It all points to you.

16:44.536 --> 16:47.630
I told you, I didn't have
anything to do with it!

16:47.706 --> 16:49.901
But you're a Iiar, Erin,
and everybody knows it.

16:49.975 --> 16:51.169
Nicole knew it.

16:51.243 --> 16:53.234
She has everything,
and she comes after me?

16:53.312 --> 16:54.301
Exactly.

16:54.380 --> 16:56.871
She has everything you want,
and you made her pay for it.

16:56.949 --> 16:59.315
I didn't.
Yeah, but someone did.

16:59.385 --> 17:03.515
Who was it? Come on,
your boyfriend? Some junkie
you met on the street?

17:03.589 --> 17:06.251
BENSON: You're afraid
that he's going to hurt you,
just Iike he did Nicole.

17:06.325 --> 17:08.224
Who're you hiding from?

17:09.694 --> 17:11.321
Who is he, Erin?

17:13.098 --> 17:14.190
Kyle.

17:18.637 --> 17:20.867
Kyle Novacek's your boyfriend.

17:21.272 --> 17:23.707
Hers. Nicole's.

17:26.345 --> 17:28.006
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

17:29.281 --> 17:31.715
We got a communications
problem, Kyle.

17:31.784 --> 17:33.945
We keep asking you questions,
and you keep Iying.

17:34.019 --> 17:35.919
I didn't Iie. I told you
where I was that night.

17:35.988 --> 17:38.616
Half the guys in Sing Sing
got alibis.

17:39.591 --> 17:42.185
Come on, Iook. Wait a second.

17:42.261 --> 17:44.161
I'II tell you the truth.
We don't care about the truth.

17:44.229 --> 17:45.753
We're gonna take you in
for a Iittle DNA test,

17:45.831 --> 17:47.594
prove you raped her.
That's all the truth we need.

17:47.666 --> 17:50.760
The test's gonna be positive.
Nicole and I made Iove
that afternoon.

17:50.836 --> 17:52.428
You raped her,
you cut her open.

17:52.504 --> 17:54.495
Then you beat up another woman
to keep her mouth shut.

17:54.573 --> 17:55.870
I knew you'd think
I was guilty.

17:55.941 --> 17:58.967
Well, that's 'cause you are,
you sick bastard.
You killed the baby.

17:59.044 --> 18:00.477
It was mine.

18:02.314 --> 18:04.009
The baby was mine.

18:05.317 --> 18:07.683
Would I do that
to my own child?

18:11.156 --> 18:12.748
STABLER: Where is Novacek?

18:12.825 --> 18:14.452
Crying his eyes out in One.

18:14.526 --> 18:16.619
CSU's Iooking for the weapon
at his place.

18:16.695 --> 18:18.162
Waiting on the semen match,

18:18.230 --> 18:20.357
and we threw in
a paternity test on the baby.

18:20.432 --> 18:22.161
Doesn't prove he's innocent.

18:22.234 --> 18:25.965
She's seeing Novacek
on the side, gets pregnant,
won't Ieave her husband,

18:26.038 --> 18:27.335
Novacek decides to punish her.

18:27.406 --> 18:28.998
Or maybe the husband did it.

18:29.074 --> 18:32.874
Novacek says that Manning
was probably catching on.

18:33.612 --> 18:35.807
He never mentioned
anything about it.

18:35.881 --> 18:38.213
Which means he didn't know
or he didn't want us to know.

18:38.283 --> 18:40.615
Ask the wife.
She just woke up.

18:42.554 --> 18:45.352
I remember something
hitting me in the back
of the head, that's all.

18:45.424 --> 18:47.619
I didn't even see who did it.

18:49.094 --> 18:51.119
I woke up here,

18:53.999 --> 18:56.331
and they told me
what happened.

18:57.536 --> 18:59.663
Tell us about Kyle Novacek.

19:05.010 --> 19:09.811
I suppose you know already.
I've been seeing him
almost a year.

19:10.015 --> 19:12.142
Did you see him
the night of your attack?

19:12.217 --> 19:13.241
No.

19:13.819 --> 19:16.481
I saw him earlier
that afternoon.

19:16.855 --> 19:21.053
That's really the only time
we can be together.

19:21.126 --> 19:23.526
I know how bad this sounds.

19:23.595 --> 19:28.259
Had you two argued recently?
You can't think he did this.

19:29.101 --> 19:31.092
Kyle wanted to get married.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.228
STABLER: Did you?

19:33.772 --> 19:35.501
I told him I would,

19:37.509 --> 19:40.967
but everything changes
when you're having a baby.

19:41.046 --> 19:45.506
It's about what's safest,
not what's going to
make you happy.

19:45.984 --> 19:48.919
And you felt it was safest
to stay with your husband.

19:48.987 --> 19:51.512
Did he know about you
and Kyle?

19:51.590 --> 19:54.991
I told him
that I was Ieaving him

19:56.762 --> 19:58.992
and that the baby wasn't his.

19:59.698 --> 20:01.723
How did he react to that?

20:02.100 --> 20:04.125
I thought he would be angry,

20:05.470 --> 20:07.404
but, at the time,
he was really calm.

20:07.472 --> 20:09.599
Your husband said
that you were meeting
for dinner at 7:00.

20:09.675 --> 20:12.371
Did he know that
you were running Iate?

20:13.278 --> 20:15.576
I was meeting him at 7:30.

20:17.716 --> 20:19.741
Did Richard tell you 7:00?

20:24.990 --> 20:26.981
Why wasn't the husband
a suspect to begin with?

20:27.059 --> 20:29.186
'Cause none of the evidence
pointed to him.

20:29.261 --> 20:30.592
What do we know
about this guy?

20:30.662 --> 20:33.563
Well, he's a shrink,
so he knows how to mess
with your head.

20:33.632 --> 20:34.621
Not you.

20:34.700 --> 20:36.133
No, you're exactly right.

20:36.201 --> 20:39.136
What's more, psychiatrists
go through four years
of medical school

20:39.204 --> 20:41.069
and a one-year
medical internship.

20:41.139 --> 20:43.232
So he'd know how to do
a crude C-section.

20:43.308 --> 20:45.572
I want Dr. Manning's
alibi broken.

20:45.644 --> 20:48.010
Timewise, it's tight,
but there's room
for maneuvering.

20:48.080 --> 20:51.208
Restaurant receipt says
that Manning
had a drink at 6:59.

20:51.283 --> 20:53.478
The bartender remembers him,
but he didn't see him Ieave.

20:53.552 --> 20:54.951
Two calls from his cell phone.

20:55.020 --> 20:58.649
One at 7:50, the other at 7:52
to Nicole's cell
and their home.

20:58.724 --> 21:01.659
Now, Manning claims
that he was still
at the restaurant waiting.

21:01.727 --> 21:03.718
Unless he was across town
attacking his wife.

21:03.795 --> 21:06.161
The cell phone company
would have a better idea
of where he was

21:06.231 --> 21:08.131
when he made those calls.
We'II check on that.

21:08.200 --> 21:10.395
Neighbor said Manning got in
before 8:30.

21:10.469 --> 21:13.700
Hour at the restaurant, plus
walking time. It's plausible.

21:13.772 --> 21:16.138
Nicole didn't get
to the garage until 7:20.

21:16.208 --> 21:19.143
Because Richard told her
that they were meeting
at 7:30.

21:19.211 --> 21:20.678
We're thinking that
it's deliberate,

21:20.746 --> 21:23.681
so he'd know exactly where
she'd be and still have time
to set up his alibi.

21:23.749 --> 21:25.114
One hour window, tops.

21:25.183 --> 21:29.984
Crosses the park, attacks her,
cleans up, goes back home.

21:30.422 --> 21:32.890
AII because his wife was
carrying another man's child.

21:32.958 --> 21:35.825
Well, you know,
it could've been enough
to push him over the edge.

21:35.894 --> 21:39.091
He was cuckolded.
It's pretty common.
You see it in nature.

21:39.164 --> 21:41.223
The female of the species
seeks out the male

21:41.300 --> 21:43.598
who exhibits
the most desirable traits.

21:43.669 --> 21:47.070
You know, most species
aren't naturally monogamous.

21:47.139 --> 21:49.198
That explains
my entire marital history.

21:49.274 --> 21:53.836
Let's knock off the jokes,
all right? We're talking about
a dead baby here.

21:56.214 --> 21:58.739
AII right, his wife cheats
on him. Why not kill her?

21:58.817 --> 22:02.548
Because, you see, in his mind
the problem was the baby,
not his wife.

22:02.621 --> 22:06.113
Get rid of the baby,
get rid of the problem.
His world remains intact.

22:06.191 --> 22:07.453
Well, Iet's tear it apart.

22:07.526 --> 22:10.962
Start by getting a warrant
for the cell phone company.

22:19.071 --> 22:20.402
Hey.

22:23.141 --> 22:25.974
You know, everybody
in that room is on your side.

22:26.044 --> 22:28.478
But we're not mind-readers,

22:28.547 --> 22:31.209
and if you're not going to say
what's going on with you,
that's fine,

22:31.283 --> 22:34.548
but there's not a whole
hell of a Iot we can do.

22:37.622 --> 22:41.251
I know you're on my side.
EIIiot, what is going on?

22:42.594 --> 22:43.754
Would you talk to me?

22:43.829 --> 22:47.265
Is there somebody else?
No, it's nothing Iike that.

22:47.966 --> 22:52.460
To be honest, it'd be easier
if there was. I...

22:52.871 --> 22:55.203
I don't know what this is.

22:56.074 --> 22:59.635
It's... It just never
goes away, you know.

23:00.612 --> 23:03.445
Every case, a Iittle bit
more horrific than the Iast.

23:05.517 --> 23:06.950
And I go home.

23:08.186 --> 23:10.381
What am I supposed to do,
talk about my day at work?

23:10.455 --> 23:14.687
"Honey, today a guy cut a baby
out of his wife's stomach.
Pass the gravy, please."

23:14.760 --> 23:17.024
So you just don't talk at all.

23:18.463 --> 23:20.556
That's no solution, EIIiot.

23:23.368 --> 23:27.270
Well, one of us has to be able
to sleep at night.

23:27.339 --> 23:29.671
She thinks I'm shutting
her out.

23:34.679 --> 23:37.944
You are.
That's exactly what you do.

23:39.651 --> 23:43.747
You keep this up,
you're going to ruin
the best thing you ever had.

23:50.362 --> 23:54.196
The phone wasn't GPS assisted,
so we can't give you
a precise Iocation.

23:54.266 --> 23:56.928
But the call detail record
will tell us which cell site
he used.

23:57.002 --> 23:58.230
How close will it get us?

23:58.303 --> 23:59.770
With all the wireless
companies operating

23:59.838 --> 24:03.797
there are anywhere from
400 to 600 cell sites
all over the city.

24:03.875 --> 24:05.570
Depending on the angle

24:05.644 --> 24:09.011
and the time-distance arrival
of the radio frequency,

24:09.080 --> 24:11.378
sometimes we can narrow
it down to a couple of blocks.

24:12.117 --> 24:15.575
This is it. Cell site 24.

24:15.654 --> 24:19.647
Lincoln Center. Not far from
where Nicole was attacked.

24:19.724 --> 24:22.625
Manning said he made the calls
from the restaurant
in the Upper East Side.

24:22.694 --> 24:24.628
So what's he doing
on the other side of town?

24:25.530 --> 24:27.020
Changing his clothes
most Iikely.

24:27.098 --> 24:29.123
Manning belongs to a gym
near Lincoln Center.

24:29.201 --> 24:30.225
Signed in at 8:00.

24:30.302 --> 24:32.668
What, he just walked in
wearing bloody clothing?

24:32.737 --> 24:34.034
CIeaned up most of it
at the scene.

24:34.105 --> 24:36.471
The dump site where they found
the baby was on the way.

24:36.541 --> 24:40.341
Gym receptionist said that
he was wearing a Iong coat
and carrying a duffel bag.

24:40.412 --> 24:42.778
Probably made the calls
to establish he was
Iooking for Nicole,

24:42.848 --> 24:44.941
showered, and went home.
What'd we find at the gym?

24:45.016 --> 24:47.314
Unfortunately, nothing there
Iinks to the crime scene.

24:47.385 --> 24:49.615
The dumpster was empty,
no regular Iocker,

24:49.688 --> 24:53.180
and CSU won't even bother
checking the drain traps
on public showers.

24:53.258 --> 24:54.247
Can't blame them.

24:54.326 --> 24:55.725
We canvassing
the cab companies?

24:55.794 --> 24:57.421
He had Iess than half an hour
to get home.

24:57.496 --> 25:00.192
No.
I don't think he took a cab.

25:00.966 --> 25:02.433
He's been fairly meticulous
so far.

25:02.501 --> 25:03.900
That would be one more witness
he didn't need.

25:03.969 --> 25:04.993
Could he have run?

25:05.070 --> 25:07.595
We clocked it.
Manning had plenty of time.

25:07.672 --> 25:09.071
You both ran it?

25:09.140 --> 25:11.472
Walked it, and we still had
a couple of minutes to spare.

25:11.543 --> 25:13.841
He's got a motive.
He Iied about his alibi.

25:13.912 --> 25:16.904
The gym bag could be
at his house. He had to carry
that baby in something.

25:16.982 --> 25:18.643
AIong with the murder weapon
and blood evidence.

25:18.717 --> 25:20.412
I'II call Cabot for a warrant.

25:20.485 --> 25:23.283
Doc, I want you in
on this search.
You know how shrinks operate.

25:23.355 --> 25:25.619
Time to give up
your trade secrets.
Okay.

25:31.630 --> 25:34.622
What've you got?
Well, there's no gym bag.

25:34.699 --> 25:37.429
And aside from these
manicure scissors,
there's no cutting instrument.

25:37.502 --> 25:41.461
But this guy is
a piece of work.
You gotta check this out.

25:41.540 --> 25:44.441
His Iaundry is nicer
than my entire wardrobe.

25:44.509 --> 25:48.001
Folds and Iabels them.
Whites, colors, dry cleaning.

25:48.079 --> 25:50.172
Anything marked
"bloody clothes"?

25:51.082 --> 25:54.381
He's got enough
personal hygiene products
in here to open his own salon.

25:54.452 --> 25:55.476
AII his.

25:55.554 --> 25:58.352
So do I, but that doesn't
make me a murderer.

25:58.423 --> 26:00.789
Everything about him
is all about appearances.

26:00.859 --> 26:02.656
Working out,
this gym equipment.

26:02.727 --> 26:05.821
For some reason,
he has feelings
of being unattractive,

26:05.897 --> 26:06.886
unmanly.

26:06.965 --> 26:08.990
His advantage is that
he's extremely intelligent

26:09.067 --> 26:11.126
as evidenced
by his careful planning.

26:11.202 --> 26:14.501
Ironically, he's probably
a pretty gifted psychiatrist.

26:14.573 --> 26:17.667
I especially admire
his gift for killing babies.

26:17.742 --> 26:21.041
It's a symptom
of the same problem.
He's preoccupied with order.

26:21.112 --> 26:24.206
He thinks
that if he can control
every detail of his Iife,

26:24.282 --> 26:27.115
then he can become this man
that he wants to be.

26:27.185 --> 26:30.643
His wife wasn't so easy
to control. Look at this mess.

26:30.722 --> 26:33.282
Well, when she threatened
to destroy the order
that he created

26:33.358 --> 26:35.690
then he went to extremes
to get it back.

26:37.462 --> 26:38.520
What's it Iook Iike?

26:38.597 --> 26:41.464
We're taking every knife
from the kitchen
back to the Iab,

26:41.533 --> 26:43.296
but I'm not hoping for much.

26:43.368 --> 26:45.632
I doubt he brought anything
from the crime scene
back here.

26:45.704 --> 26:47.968
What the hell is this?

26:48.039 --> 26:50.633
It's a search, Dr. Manning.
We'II be out of your way
in a minute.

26:50.709 --> 26:52.734
You can't march in here
and destroy my home.

26:52.811 --> 26:57.145
Yeah, it's a real bite in the
ass, isn't it? AII those new
Iabels you'II have to make...

26:57.882 --> 26:59.042
Those your only set of keys?

26:59.117 --> 27:00.379
Yeah.

27:00.452 --> 27:01.476
Tough.

27:01.553 --> 27:02.577
I need those.

27:02.687 --> 27:04.154
Ramone.
Yeah?

27:04.222 --> 27:06.588
Luminol these for me,
will you?

27:08.226 --> 27:12.253
VARGAS: See, the problem
with blood is,
it gets absorbed by plastic.

27:12.330 --> 27:13.820
Can't wash it off.

27:13.898 --> 27:15.798
What is that supposed to be?

27:15.867 --> 27:18.165
Exactly
what we're Iooking for.

27:22.173 --> 27:25.506
You remember Dr. George Huang
from our search today?

27:27.145 --> 27:29.978
He's a psychiatrist, too.
This is Dr. Richard Manning.

27:30.048 --> 27:32.539
They brought you in
to shrink the shrink, huh?

27:32.617 --> 27:34.551
Does that make you feel
important?

27:34.619 --> 27:37.884
It just seems unnecessary.
I didn't do anything wrong.

27:37.956 --> 27:40.083
Your wife did though, right?
No.

27:40.158 --> 27:44.151
We were having
marital problems, and we were
working on solving them.

27:44.229 --> 27:45.287
She Ieft you.

27:45.363 --> 27:47.024
I wouldn't say
she was Ieaving me

27:47.098 --> 27:49.726
so much as going to the man
who fathered her child.

27:49.801 --> 27:52.929
She just thought
that was the best solution
to her problem.

27:53.004 --> 27:56.337
HUANG:
But it was the wrong solution.

27:56.875 --> 28:00.743
And now her problem
doesn't exist because
there is no child.

28:01.479 --> 28:04.471
Well, yes.
BENSON:
Well, actually, Dr. Manning,

28:04.649 --> 28:07.083
Nicole wasn't going to marry
Kyle Novacek.

28:07.152 --> 28:08.983
AII she wanted
was to get away from you.

28:09.054 --> 28:10.851
Nicole doesn't know
what she wants.

28:10.922 --> 28:14.187
Apparently she wanted
to have a relationship
with another man. Why?

28:14.259 --> 28:16.784
She probably felt
our relationship was Iacking.

28:16.861 --> 28:19.489
Lacking is a real
interesting word.

28:20.298 --> 28:22.823
What is it you were Iacking,
Dick?

28:23.835 --> 28:25.769
Challenging my masculinity.

28:25.837 --> 28:28.465
A Iittle amateurish,
don't you think?
HUANG: No.

28:28.540 --> 28:32.874
I think he's challenging
your masculinity because it's
a pretty obvious weakness.

28:32.944 --> 28:34.707
You're a smart guy.

28:35.180 --> 28:37.740
Your problem is
you think you're smarter
than everyone else.

28:37.816 --> 28:39.215
That's why you screw up.

28:39.284 --> 28:41.149
You been to the gym Iately?

28:42.487 --> 28:45.752
Yes. I forgot to mention that.
I did go to the gym
that night.

28:45.824 --> 28:49.021
I was very worried
about Nicole, so I Ieft.

28:49.094 --> 28:54.088
Oh, well, there you go,
mystery solved. See, that's
why you're such a genius.

28:54.399 --> 28:58.893
Can't fool you,
not for a second. So, genius,
what I want to know is

28:58.970 --> 29:01.097
how in the hell Nicole
fooled you into believing

29:01.172 --> 29:03.163
you were the father
of her child.

29:03.241 --> 29:06.472
Your wife made you Iook
stupid, and you
made her pay for it.

29:06.544 --> 29:07.670
I Iove my wife.

29:07.746 --> 29:08.974
You almost killed her.

29:09.047 --> 29:10.947
No, he killed the baby.

29:11.015 --> 29:14.109
He just wasn't smart enough
to do the job right.

29:14.452 --> 29:16.010
I don't even know
what that means.

29:16.087 --> 29:20.148
Nicole will never have
children again, Dr. Manning,
and neither will you.

29:20.225 --> 29:21.749
STABLER:
You screwed up, smart guy.

29:21.826 --> 29:23.418
You couldn't be
more wrong about me.

29:23.495 --> 29:26.123
AII I care about is
my wife and my family.

29:26.197 --> 29:27.391
It ruined everything.

29:27.465 --> 29:28.830
Your wife's child.

29:29.100 --> 29:31.432
Yeah.
And so you got rid of it.

29:31.669 --> 29:33.261
Wouldn't anyone?

29:44.149 --> 29:45.138
Arrest him.

29:45.216 --> 29:46.706
We've got him
for attempted murder
and assault one

29:46.785 --> 29:48.946
for the attack on the mother,
plus abortion one.

29:49.020 --> 29:52.387
And murder.
He killed that baby.

29:53.658 --> 29:55.990
Warner's certain of that?

29:56.060 --> 29:58.119
Baby was alive, now it's dead.
What's the problem?

29:58.196 --> 29:59.788
The problem is whether or not
we can establish

29:59.864 --> 30:02.196
the baby was Iegally a person.

30:02.267 --> 30:04.132
But how do we do that?

30:04.202 --> 30:07.171
Prove the baby was born alive
according to
New York State Law.

30:07.238 --> 30:10.036
Something that indicates
it took a breath, moved.

30:10.108 --> 30:12.042
If it died while it was
still in its mother's womb,

30:12.110 --> 30:14.544
it technically wasn't
a person, so it's not murder.

30:14.612 --> 30:17.775
If that baby
had been born in a hospital,
it would've Iived.

30:17.849 --> 30:18.975
Doesn't matter.

30:19.050 --> 30:21.382
Neo-natacides are notoriously
difficult to prosecute

30:21.452 --> 30:24.683
because the medical evidence
is almost always inconclusive.

30:24.756 --> 30:27.657
Without a witness
stating unequivocally
the baby was a Iive birth,

30:27.725 --> 30:30.193
I'm just not certain we'd get
a murder conviction through.

30:30.261 --> 30:33.094
Best we can do is illegal
third-trimester abortion.

30:33.164 --> 30:35.928
That's a D-felony.
We'II get more out of
the assault charge.

30:36.000 --> 30:40.528
At seven months, a baby
moves inside of the mother.

30:41.272 --> 30:44.400
The only reason that baby
is dead is because
he bashed its skull in.

30:44.475 --> 30:47.603
Now, I don't care if you
call it a person or not,
that's murder.

30:47.679 --> 30:51.080
That argument
could also be used
to condemn Iegal abortion.

30:51.149 --> 30:54.050
Do you want me to charge
every doctor who performs
an abortion with murder?

30:54.118 --> 30:56.609
Abortion is different.
It's the mother's choice.

30:56.688 --> 30:58.781
We're not talking about
the mother's rights.

30:58.857 --> 31:01.087
You want to charge
for homicide
with the fetus as victim,

31:01.159 --> 31:03.753
you give the fetus rights.
Do you want to go
down that road?

31:03.828 --> 31:04.886
It's not the same thing.

31:04.963 --> 31:06.328
In the eyes of the Iaw, it is.

31:06.397 --> 31:07.489
Well, the Iaw needs to change.

31:07.565 --> 31:10.090
BENSON: I don't know, EIIiot.
You can't have it both ways.

31:10.168 --> 31:11.999
A fetus is either a Iife
or it's not.

31:12.070 --> 31:13.560
You saw that baby.

31:13.638 --> 31:15.162
OIivia, you saw that baby.

31:15.240 --> 31:18.573
This guy's gonna walk.
And I don't Iike it
any more than you do,

31:18.643 --> 31:21.077
but this is
very dangerous territory.

31:21.145 --> 31:24.546
And I am not prepared to
dismantle reproductive rights
on an inconclusive case.

31:24.616 --> 31:28.347
We're going to Iet
a murderer get away
to preserve a political ideal.

31:28.419 --> 31:30.683
I don't even know
what I'm doing here!

31:30.855 --> 31:32.846
Take a break, Detective.

31:38.463 --> 31:40.590
Your ME comes back with
solid medical evidence

31:40.665 --> 31:43.065
the baby was born alive,
we've got something
to work with.

31:43.134 --> 31:47.127
But I will not charge
for murder on the death
of an unborn child.

31:48.706 --> 31:50.867
You and your partner park
yourself in Warner's office

31:50.942 --> 31:52.773
until she hands
over that autopsy.

31:52.844 --> 31:55.608
AIex, unless you've got other
plans, I want you there, too.

31:55.680 --> 31:58.581
Why?
You need solid
medical evidence?

31:58.650 --> 32:00.675
Make sure Warner's got it.

32:02.954 --> 32:05.855
WARNER: Presence of gas
in the stomach,
contracted umbilical cord,

32:05.924 --> 32:08.518
subpleural
and subepicardial petechiae,

32:08.593 --> 32:13.292
partially expanded pulmonary
alveoli, fully-aerated,
crepitant, salmon-pink Iungs.

32:13.364 --> 32:14.422
In English?

32:14.499 --> 32:17.525
He took a breath.
Probably more than one.

32:17.602 --> 32:18.967
So, he was a Iive birth?

32:19.037 --> 32:20.629
That's what I'm saying
in my report.

32:20.705 --> 32:23.265
To be clear, if I'm going
to charge Richard Manning

32:23.341 --> 32:25.775
with the murder of the baby,
that means
I drop the abortion charge

32:25.843 --> 32:27.868
and the attempted
murder charge of Nicole.

32:27.946 --> 32:29.277
We can only have one theory
of the crime.

32:29.347 --> 32:31.315
Either he was trying to kill
his wife or his child.

32:31.382 --> 32:34.510
Meaning we better be
damn sure,
he only goes down for assault.

32:34.585 --> 32:38.180
Neonates decompose at
a faster rate, so there's
an inevitable margin of error.

32:38.256 --> 32:40.087
Which doesn't
do us any favors.

32:40.158 --> 32:43.355
You need to be willing
to testify to a reasonable
degree of medical certainty

32:43.428 --> 32:46.329
this was a Iive birth.
I am.

32:48.967 --> 32:51.265
I'II supersede
the indictments.

32:56.607 --> 32:59.007
I also performed
a hydrostatic test
on the Iungs

32:59.077 --> 33:01.511
in order to determine
if they had been inflated.

33:01.579 --> 33:05.037
Dr. Warner,
you are Iooking at a guy
who failed biology twice.

33:05.116 --> 33:09.052
I'm a science idiot.
What is a hydrostatic test?

33:09.153 --> 33:12.554
The Iungs are placed in water.
If a significant portion
of the Iungs float,

33:12.623 --> 33:15.558
it means
they had been inflated,
as was the case here.

33:15.626 --> 33:19.790
So this means the fetus
took a breath?
Yes.

33:20.465 --> 33:23.400
Dr. Warner, will you define

33:24.736 --> 33:27.364
postmortem putrefaction
for me?

33:27.438 --> 33:31.238
It describes the series
of changes that occur
to tissue after death.

33:31.309 --> 33:33.402
Those changes include
the formation of gases,

33:33.478 --> 33:37.881
such as mercaptans
and hydrogen sulfide, right?

33:39.217 --> 33:41.082
Yes.
Let me ask this.

33:41.219 --> 33:43.278
After your initial
hydrostatic test,

33:43.354 --> 33:47.791
did you deflate the Iungs,
re-inflate them,
and then repeat the test

33:47.859 --> 33:51.488
to expel any gasses
that may have been present
due to decomposition?

33:51.562 --> 33:54.725
Performing the test twice
is often misleading.

33:54.799 --> 33:57.632
So you probably
didn't do it, then.
Objection.

33:57.702 --> 34:00.034
I'm sure there are plenty
of tests the doctor
did not perform,

34:00.104 --> 34:01.401
none of which are relevant.

34:01.472 --> 34:04.532
Overruled. The witness
may answer the question.

34:05.810 --> 34:07.937
I did not perform
the test a second time.

34:08.012 --> 34:09.842
LANGAN: Okay. You were
probably busy that day,

34:09.914 --> 34:10.938
that's understandable...
Your Honor...

34:11.014 --> 34:13.108
Let's keep up the pace,
Mr. Langan.

34:13.951 --> 34:16.146
Is it possible
the expansion of the Iungs

34:16.219 --> 34:19.451
could be attributed
to post-mortem putrefaction?

34:20.291 --> 34:22.020
It is possible, but there
were other factors...

34:22.092 --> 34:23.754
Assume you're right, though,

34:23.828 --> 34:26.023
and the fetus took a breath.

34:27.697 --> 34:32.692
Dr. Warner, tell me,
for a baby to be
considered born,

34:33.137 --> 34:37.301
it has to be completely
expelled from the uterus,
am I right?

34:39.777 --> 34:40.835
Yes.

34:40.911 --> 34:45.076
Is it possible
a fetus can take a breath

34:45.149 --> 34:46.775
while partially expelled

34:47.685 --> 34:50.585
but die before
it is fully expelled?

34:52.757 --> 34:54.554
Yes, it is possible.

34:55.893 --> 34:59.590
Is there any way to determine
when the breath was taken,

34:59.664 --> 35:02.258
assuming it was taken
to begin with?

35:04.869 --> 35:07.599
Short of eyewitness
testimony, no.

35:08.372 --> 35:10.272
LANGAN: But we
don't have that.

35:11.542 --> 35:15.603
Thank you, Dr. Warner.
You've been very patient
with my ignorance.

35:19.484 --> 35:21.748
Tell me that Iooked worse
than it actually was.

35:21.819 --> 35:24.754
If you think it Iooks Iike
we just Iost our murder
conviction, you're right.

35:24.822 --> 35:26.346
Warner said exactly
what you wanted her to say,

35:26.424 --> 35:29.154
and you Iet
Manning's Iawyer sandbag her.
Why didn't you stop him?

35:29.227 --> 35:31.388
Because he's right, Detective.

35:31.462 --> 35:33.293
We can't prove how and when
that baby died

35:33.364 --> 35:34.388
beyond a reasonable doubt,

35:34.465 --> 35:36.831
and if you want to blame me
for that, go right ahead.

35:36.901 --> 35:38.630
So we got nothing?

35:39.604 --> 35:41.799
Barring an outright confession
the child was alive,

35:41.873 --> 35:44.899
he gets three-and-half to nine
for the assault, out in two.

35:44.976 --> 35:48.878
Unless he gets off entirely
on extreme emotional distress.

35:50.314 --> 35:52.646
I wish I could do more,
EIIiot.

36:03.027 --> 36:04.255
Detective, what a surprise.

36:04.328 --> 36:06.228
Don't say anything.

36:07.598 --> 36:10.431
PIease,
start harassing my client.
I'd Iove a mistrial.

36:10.501 --> 36:13.561
Trevor, Ieave us alone
for a bit, please.

36:14.839 --> 36:18.570
I'm going to waste my breath
and strongly advise
against it.

36:19.577 --> 36:21.670
Anything you say
is going right to the DA.

36:21.746 --> 36:23.577
Just a few minutes.

36:33.224 --> 36:36.557
Usually my time is worth
$200 an hour.

36:37.828 --> 36:40.228
Not worth much now, is it?

36:40.298 --> 36:41.697
It's a matter of opinion.

36:47.238 --> 36:49.832
You must be pretty proud
of yourself.

36:50.808 --> 36:53.106
Getting everybody
to buy your story.

36:53.177 --> 36:54.337
It's the truth.

36:57.114 --> 37:00.743
Tell me again how it happened,
how you murdered that baby.

37:01.052 --> 37:05.716
You don't actually think
you're going to get me
to confess something, do you?

37:07.225 --> 37:10.217
But that's not why
you're really here, is it?

37:10.895 --> 37:12.988
You're gonna shrink me now?

37:14.465 --> 37:16.023
You want me to?

37:24.942 --> 37:28.673
You're married.
Eighteen years.

37:28.846 --> 37:30.473
Children as well?

37:30.548 --> 37:31.742
Four of them.

37:34.685 --> 37:37.779
Wouldn't you do anything
to protect your family?

37:42.593 --> 37:47.428
Killing a child? No, I don't
see myself doing that.

37:49.467 --> 37:52.459
Maybe not, but you know
what your problem is?

37:52.703 --> 37:55.729
You understand that impulse.

37:55.806 --> 37:59.071
You know exactly
why I did what I had to do.

38:01.812 --> 38:04.337
Protect what you have
by destroying it?

38:04.415 --> 38:06.542
No. I didn't destroy anything.

38:13.057 --> 38:15.218
Think about it.

38:15.293 --> 38:16.954
I didn't destroy anything.

38:28.406 --> 38:33.207
Nicole and I agreed to meet
to try to salvage
our marriage.

38:33.544 --> 38:37.310
I was waiting
at the restaurant,
and all I could think was,

38:37.381 --> 38:39.372
"She's with him.

38:39.450 --> 38:42.613
"She's with him, right now,
and they're Iaughing at me."

38:43.654 --> 38:46.350
Not very rational thoughts.
Objection.

38:46.424 --> 38:48.654
Put a question mark
on it Mr. Langan.

38:48.726 --> 38:51.820
In your estimation,
as a psychiatrist,

38:51.929 --> 38:54.397
were your thoughts
those of a rational person?

38:54.465 --> 38:55.693
No.

38:56.300 --> 39:00.634
I could only describe it
as a textbook,
total break with reality.

39:00.838 --> 39:04.569
And then suddenly
I was running across the park,
finding her,

39:04.642 --> 39:09.477
and acting solely
on these powerful emotions
that I could not control.

39:09.547 --> 39:12.015
Can you characterize
your state of mind
during that time?

39:12.083 --> 39:15.348
It was as if I was possessed

39:15.986 --> 39:18.216
or being controlled
by someone else.

39:18.289 --> 39:22.555
I Iook back now,
and I can't believe

39:22.626 --> 39:24.150
what I've done
to the woman I Iove.

39:25.696 --> 39:28.824
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

39:31.102 --> 39:32.933
No further questions.

39:33.804 --> 39:36.068
People are entering
into evidence
the People's Four.

39:36.140 --> 39:37.505
Defense has no knowledge
of this evidence...

39:37.575 --> 39:38.599
Which my detectives

39:38.676 --> 39:42.544
only just brought to me.
Knock it off.
Bring that over here.

39:55.459 --> 39:58.451
This evidence was not
made available in discovery.
It can't be presented.

39:58.529 --> 40:00.929
This is an extraneous matter
not material to the charge.

40:00.998 --> 40:03.728
The People had no duty
to tender it upon discovery.

40:03.801 --> 40:07.567
I'm Ietting it in,
assuming Miss Cabot
convinces me it's relevant.

40:07.638 --> 40:09.299
Request a recess
to confer with my client.

40:09.373 --> 40:11.034
So, what,
you can advise him to Iie?

40:11.108 --> 40:14.475
He's on the stand,
and he's staying there.
Step back.

40:18.682 --> 40:21.116
Dr. Manning,
you testified that you snapped

40:21.185 --> 40:24.279
because your wife told you
she was having an affair

40:24.355 --> 40:26.823
and that her unborn child
was fathered by another man,

40:26.891 --> 40:29.416
causing you to attack her

40:29.493 --> 40:32.121
and cut the child from
her body. Is that correct?

40:32.196 --> 40:33.629
Yes.

40:33.697 --> 40:36.757
How did you know
she was telling you the truth?

40:37.935 --> 40:39.869
Why would she Iie about that?

40:39.937 --> 40:42.963
Were you unable to have
children, Dr. Manning?

40:44.475 --> 40:46.773
I'm capable
of having children.

40:47.077 --> 40:52.071
And were you having sexual
relations with your wife seven
months prior to her attack?

40:52.450 --> 40:53.610
Yes.

40:53.684 --> 40:56.278
But you took her word for it
that she was having an affair?

40:56.353 --> 40:59.049
I knew about that
before she told me.

40:59.857 --> 41:01.347
For how Iong?

41:02.259 --> 41:03.351
From the beginning?

41:03.427 --> 41:04.655
CIose to it.

41:04.728 --> 41:07.663
Then it's fair to say
you would know,

41:07.731 --> 41:11.064
probably, if your wife
was having an affair
with yet another man.

41:11.135 --> 41:13.069
Objection.
That is totally irrelevant.

41:13.137 --> 41:14.798
I think we both know it's not,
Your Honor.

41:14.872 --> 41:18.774
Speak for yourself,
Miss Cabot. Prove relevance
quickly or move on.

41:18.843 --> 41:22.939
Is it all possible your wife
was having an affair
that you didn't know about?

41:23.013 --> 41:25.004
No, absolutely not.

41:25.082 --> 41:26.379
How do you know this?

41:26.984 --> 41:29.851
I am aware of what goes on
in my own house.

41:30.154 --> 41:33.885
So the only two people who
could have possibly fathered
Nicole Manning's child

41:33.958 --> 41:36.392
were yourself
and Kyle Novacek?

41:36.794 --> 41:38.762
She told me it was him.

41:39.763 --> 41:41.424
People's Four.

41:41.499 --> 41:45.060
This is the paternity test
against Nicole Manning's
child and Kyle Novacek,

41:45.135 --> 41:48.502
proving that, in fact,
Mr. Novacek is not the father.

41:48.772 --> 41:49.830
LANGAN: Objection.

41:49.907 --> 41:52.569
CABOT: So the Iogical
deduction is that
you were the father

41:52.643 --> 41:54.076
of your wife's child,
Dr. Manning.

41:54.144 --> 41:56.374
LANGAN: Whether he was right
or not about the paternity
of the fetus

41:56.447 --> 41:57.914
has no bearing
on his state of mind.

41:57.982 --> 41:59.677
PRESTON: Overruled.

42:00.117 --> 42:02.745
Isn't it probable,
Dr. Manning,

42:02.820 --> 42:05.880
that you were the father
of your wife's child?

42:11.362 --> 42:14.024
I would've known.
How?

42:19.503 --> 42:21.630
How could you have known?

42:23.007 --> 42:26.272
You were so sure he couldn't
have been your child.

42:29.046 --> 42:31.276
But he had to be, Dr. Manning.

42:32.349 --> 42:37.048
There's no other explanation,
is there?
I don't know.

42:39.690 --> 42:43.956
You held your own child
in your hands,

42:44.028 --> 42:45.962
your own Iiving child.

42:54.705 --> 42:56.332
Did he cry?

42:58.242 --> 43:01.473
Did your son cry
before you killed him?

43:09.486 --> 43:11.386
He only cried a Iittle.

43:12.823 --> 43:14.757
He only cried a Iittle.
