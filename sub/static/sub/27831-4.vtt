00:11.886 --> 00:12.721
I heard.

00:13.471 --> 00:15.181
How to definitively switch bodies.

00:15.265 --> 00:17.392
-From who?
-Don't look at me like that.

00:19.811 --> 00:23.898
-I will never leave your side.
-Even so, I don't want that.

00:23.982 --> 00:26.109
I like you as you are now!

00:26.192 --> 00:28.278
-You've misunderstood.
-Huh?

00:28.361 --> 00:30.155
I'm not switching with Kaga.

00:32.240 --> 00:33.450
He will switch with Ayumi.

00:36.786 --> 00:38.038
During the next Red Moon,

00:39.706 --> 00:41.750
I will end their lives.

00:47.130 --> 00:48.298
I realized something.

00:49.591 --> 00:51.134
Instead of switching myself,

00:51.259 --> 00:54.387
it's more entertaining to watch
other people switch from afar.

00:58.600 --> 00:59.476
But,

01:00.685 --> 01:02.395
how do you plan to make it happen?

01:06.816 --> 01:10.862
Dying in front of the person you want
to be is one of the conditions.

01:11.529 --> 01:14.115
Isn't it impossible to make them do that?

01:16.493 --> 01:17.619
That won't be a problem.

01:17.994 --> 01:18.828
What?

01:18.912 --> 01:21.039
We can easily trick them.

01:22.248 --> 01:24.292
They don't know how to distrust people.

01:24.375 --> 01:25.210
But,

01:25.293 --> 01:27.420
-what if it fails?
-We'll call it suicide.

01:29.798 --> 01:32.383
You can't forgive him, right? Kaga.

01:35.095 --> 01:36.012
For me,

01:36.930 --> 01:38.723
Umine is the cutest right now.

01:40.350 --> 01:41.601
Umine right now.

01:43.103 --> 01:45.730
Which means he denies
your existence completely.

01:52.821 --> 01:54.322
So let's teach him a lesson,

01:56.116 --> 01:59.494
that "people are more than their looks"
is merely a nice saying.

02:00.829 --> 02:01.913
Koshiro.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.082
Am I disdainful?

02:05.583 --> 02:06.417
No...

02:08.419 --> 02:10.171
I'm falling for you even more.

02:15.718 --> 02:17.011
Let me help you.

02:18.721 --> 02:20.306
I'll tell you

02:21.307 --> 02:22.725
everything I know.

02:31.651 --> 02:33.278
Yummy!

02:33.820 --> 02:36.114
Strawberries taste the best
this time of year.

02:36.197 --> 02:37.448
You can really eat.

02:37.532 --> 02:40.243
Actually, I feel bad for Umine...

02:40.326 --> 02:41.161
Huh?

02:41.494 --> 02:45.123
Since I've been in her body,
I can eat a lot and never feel full.

02:45.290 --> 02:47.292
I've gained 11 pounds in two weeks.

02:48.376 --> 02:50.336
Don't worry. Eat your heart out.

02:51.337 --> 02:52.172
Okay.

02:52.797 --> 02:53.840
That's what I'll do.

02:56.301 --> 02:57.969
You seem to be enjoying yourself.

02:59.429 --> 03:00.513
Ms. Ukon.

03:01.931 --> 03:03.141
Why are we here?

03:03.933 --> 03:04.893
You two...

03:06.186 --> 03:08.646
are going to lose your lives like this.

04:16.673 --> 04:17.924
We're going to switch?

04:18.007 --> 04:20.969
Koshiro doesn't have a reason to hurt us.

04:21.803 --> 04:22.845
It's a mistake!

04:22.929 --> 04:25.807
Even if you say that,
I wasn't the one who heard it.

04:25.890 --> 04:26.724
Then who? Amagase.

04:28.434 --> 04:29.269
Amagase?

04:33.815 --> 04:35.400
Yes. Him.

04:36.859 --> 04:37.860
Are you mocking us?

04:38.361 --> 04:39.570
Ayumi, let's go.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.948
He switched, too.

04:44.450 --> 04:45.535
Amagase

04:46.160 --> 04:47.453
was originally human.

04:48.454 --> 04:50.415
-Really?
-Don't believe her!

04:50.498 --> 04:51.708
That's a load of crap!

04:51.791 --> 04:53.293
It is not a load of crap.

04:57.380 --> 04:58.715
Do you believe me now?

05:03.303 --> 05:06.514
Amagase turned into a parakeet
six years ago.

05:06.848 --> 05:08.766
When I was 46.

05:12.895 --> 05:15.356
NINE MILLION YEN DEBT

05:15.481 --> 05:17.108
CO-SIGNER KENZO AMAGASE

05:17.191 --> 05:19.527
<i>He was betrayed by a trusted friend.</i>

05:20.653 --> 05:22.030
Go quickly!

05:22.488 --> 05:23.323
Hurry up!

05:23.406 --> 05:24.907
<i>His family abandoned him.</i>

05:25.033 --> 05:26.492
Masako!

05:26.576 --> 05:29.537
<i>Before he knew it, he had lost everything.</i>

05:31.539 --> 05:34.459
<i>Then, inside his fading consciousness</i>
<i>he began to wish.</i>

05:37.128 --> 05:41.507
<i>The parakeet in front of him</i>
<i>had such pure and beautiful eyes.</i>

05:47.930 --> 05:49.766
-That's impossible!
-But...

05:51.893 --> 05:54.103
all the conditions were satisfied.

05:56.230 --> 05:58.316
You were betrayed by your lover

05:58.941 --> 06:01.486
and he just couldn't leave you alone.

06:02.362 --> 06:06.949
Koshiro Mizumoto will be unfazed
if the switch fails and you die.

06:07.325 --> 06:08.868
We'll call it suicide. I told you.

06:15.958 --> 06:18.044
At this rate, you'll lose your lives.

06:27.512 --> 06:28.346
Ayumi.

06:34.268 --> 06:35.269
I can back off.

06:37.146 --> 06:38.731
I feel the same way as you. We don't want to doubt Koshiro.

06:43.778 --> 06:45.154
Even though he's smart,

06:45.988 --> 06:48.074
he's honest to a fault and very serious.

06:49.200 --> 06:51.619
There must be a reason
behind all his actions.

06:53.955 --> 06:54.831
Kaga.

06:57.333 --> 06:58.584
Are you two stupid?

06:59.544 --> 07:00.837
Koshiro Mizumoto

07:01.129 --> 07:02.964
doesn't give a damn about you.

07:03.047 --> 07:04.715
He is not that type of person!

07:06.717 --> 07:07.885
Koshiro...

07:09.220 --> 07:11.222
saved my life.

07:13.057 --> 07:15.601
Somebody help me!

07:15.685 --> 07:16.727
I'm scared!

07:16.811 --> 07:18.896
Koshiro, help me!

07:24.610 --> 07:26.571
Ayumi, where are you?

07:26.779 --> 07:28.197
Hey, Ayumi!

07:29.407 --> 07:30.700
Ayumi!

07:30.783 --> 07:32.034
Koshiro!

07:32.118 --> 07:33.828
Help me, please!

07:33.911 --> 07:35.538
-Koshiro!
-Ayumi!

07:37.123 --> 07:39.459
-Ayumi, are you in there?
-Help me, Koshiro.

07:41.961 --> 07:44.755
Koshiro, save me!

07:45.089 --> 07:46.174
Hold on, Ayumi.

07:46.299 --> 07:47.800
I'll go get someone!

07:47.884 --> 07:50.803
No! Koshiro, don't go anywhere.

07:51.304 --> 07:52.930
I'm really scared.

07:55.433 --> 07:56.684
Are you there, Koshiro?

07:59.312 --> 08:00.855
Hey, are you there?

08:00.938 --> 08:01.856
I'm here.

08:02.398 --> 08:04.275
-Koshiro!
-Everything'll be okay!

08:04.358 --> 08:05.443
You're there, right?

08:14.368 --> 08:15.745
I found you, Ayumi!

08:18.831 --> 08:20.583
<i>When he saved me,</i>

08:21.501 --> 08:24.253
<i>Koshiro's hand was all torn up.</i>

08:27.089 --> 08:29.717
That's the Koshiro I know.

08:33.721 --> 08:34.555
Don't be fooled!

08:34.639 --> 08:36.724
He'll have you right where he wants you!

08:36.807 --> 08:37.892
You're still young--

08:38.976 --> 08:41.312
No matter what you say,
it's wasted on them.

08:44.690 --> 08:46.067
Be as cautious as possible.

08:47.068 --> 08:48.569
The next Red Moon

08:48.986 --> 08:50.321
is the day after tomorrow.

09:05.002 --> 09:06.254
What a pain in the ass!

09:08.589 --> 09:09.423
Let's see him now.

09:09.924 --> 09:11.926
See who?

09:12.009 --> 09:13.219
You know who.

09:16.722 --> 09:18.516
When I was a child,

09:18.724 --> 09:20.810
my dad was the Shinto priest here.

09:21.644 --> 09:23.980
He taught me the Red Moon song.

09:25.064 --> 09:26.148
Red Moon song?

09:28.025 --> 09:29.944
How to switch bodies is written here.

09:34.824 --> 09:37.076
"On the revolving red day,

09:37.493 --> 09:39.495
before the perfect circle,

09:39.996 --> 09:42.123
I will give you my shell,

09:42.206 --> 09:44.625
so please give me yours."

09:45.876 --> 09:49.088
Did you jump from that building
based on your belief of this?

09:51.591 --> 09:53.593
I was planning to die anyway,

09:54.677 --> 09:56.304
so I tried it.

09:58.556 --> 10:00.099
Even if I failed,

10:01.851 --> 10:04.103
no one would be sad about it.

10:27.752 --> 10:28.586
Koshiro.

10:31.505 --> 10:32.673
We trust you.

10:34.258 --> 10:38.054
I don't know what you're planning to do,

10:39.430 --> 10:42.725
but we trust you.

10:45.102 --> 10:46.020
That's all.

10:47.730 --> 10:48.564
See ya later.

11:05.623 --> 11:06.832
How stupid can you be?

11:11.671 --> 11:12.630
See you tomorrow.

11:17.635 --> 11:19.637
Why do you look so conflicted?

11:19.720 --> 11:21.263
That hurts!

11:23.766 --> 11:24.642
Don't oversleep.

11:25.893 --> 11:27.812
Don't forget to do your homework, too.

11:28.312 --> 11:29.146
Yup. Later.

11:35.528 --> 11:36.362
I love you,

11:37.279 --> 11:38.114
Ayumi.

11:38.781 --> 11:40.366
Just focus on yourself for now.

11:41.992 --> 11:44.370
<i>I'm sorry for always making you hold back.</i>

11:45.454 --> 11:48.582
<i>Kaga must be waiting for my answer...</i>

11:54.338 --> 11:56.132
I'm sorry I'm late again.

11:58.426 --> 12:00.469
-From now on--
-Don't bother coming home.

12:02.805 --> 12:04.515
Without you,

12:05.641 --> 12:07.601
life is so much easier.

12:15.943 --> 12:16.777
Good night.

12:17.903 --> 12:19.905
<i>...due to this,</i>
<i>in the town of Akatsuki,</i>

12:19.989 --> 12:24.744
<i>many more people are planning to see</i>
<i>the Red Moon.</i>

12:24.827 --> 12:28.414
<i>Shops and other spots have proved</i>
<i>to be even livelier than usual.</i>

12:30.291 --> 12:32.835
<i>Akatsuki's famous sensation,</i>
<i>the Red Moon,</i>

12:33.002 --> 12:34.962
<i>is finally arriving tomorrow.</i>

12:35.045 --> 12:38.883
<i>The rising anticipation</i>
<i>of the Red Moon's appearance is palpable.</i>

12:38.966 --> 12:40.217
RED MOON DAY IN TWO DAYS!

12:48.476 --> 12:49.977
<i>The Red Moon appears tomorrow.</i>

12:50.728 --> 12:54.482
<i>The last day I can live normally</i>

12:54.732 --> 12:56.650
<i>might be today.</i>

13:04.074 --> 13:04.909
Good morning.

13:23.093 --> 13:24.136
Kaga! Zenko!

13:24.553 --> 13:26.847
-There's something awful happening!
-Huh?

13:27.598 --> 13:30.267
I heard Kaga openly confessed yesterday!

13:30.351 --> 13:33.270
Kaga did? But wasn't he into Ayumi?

13:33.354 --> 13:35.606
He must really like ugly girls after all.

13:35.689 --> 13:37.858
But he sounded serious yesterday.

13:39.443 --> 13:41.320
It was Umine. That's gotta be a joke.

13:41.695 --> 13:42.696
This started

13:43.489 --> 13:44.949
because of that.

13:45.241 --> 13:46.242
For me,

13:46.325 --> 13:48.327
Umine is the cutest right now.

13:48.410 --> 13:49.912
How did it get like this?

13:49.995 --> 13:51.997
Kaga's difficult, but still popular.

13:52.081 --> 13:53.999
-Difficult?
-You are.

13:54.083 --> 13:56.252
What?! Look. This is pretty bad, too.

13:56.544 --> 13:57.795
Hey! Jeez...

13:58.295 --> 14:01.048
<i>Umine is the cutest right now.</i>

14:01.131 --> 14:03.676
Don't people have things to do?! Right?

14:09.056 --> 14:11.016
No, no. Oh!

14:11.392 --> 14:12.768
Speak of the devil.

14:12.852 --> 14:15.938
Hey, is it true that you're dating Kaga?

14:16.105 --> 14:18.649
He said he liked you
in front of everyone, right?

14:18.732 --> 14:20.401
Nice going, Umine.

14:20.609 --> 14:22.361
It's not like that at all.

14:22.486 --> 14:23.696
So you rejected him?

14:24.530 --> 14:25.948
That would never happen.

14:28.158 --> 14:31.579
Come to think of it,
they don't fit each other at all.

14:32.121 --> 14:34.206
Is she even aware that she's ugly?

14:37.918 --> 14:38.752
<i>Huh?</i> <i>Aware...</i>

14:48.053 --> 14:48.929
<i>that I'm ugly?</i>

14:53.100 --> 14:56.312
<i>I finally understand</i>
<i>how people were looking...</i>

14:59.106 --> 15:00.441
<i>at me and Kaga.</i>

15:03.694 --> 15:07.740
<i>Until now, whether my appearance</i>
<i>was superior or inferior</i>

15:08.449 --> 15:10.951
<i>was something I never considered.</i>

15:13.412 --> 15:14.830
<i>But the person I am now</i>

15:16.665 --> 15:17.666
<i>is ugly.</i>

15:17.833 --> 15:20.002
Man, I really am ugly.

15:20.085 --> 15:21.629
Poor Mizumoto.

15:21.712 --> 15:24.465
-This is hilarious.
-Go look in the mirror!

15:24.548 --> 15:25.841
Kaga likes ugly girls!

15:26.884 --> 15:29.094
Is she even aware that she's ugly?

15:30.554 --> 15:32.431
People that have switched once,

15:32.848 --> 15:34.850
can never return to normal.

15:43.233 --> 15:44.318
Ow! Just kidding.

15:52.159 --> 15:52.993
Hey. What're you doing?

15:56.246 --> 15:57.414
Um...

15:57.957 --> 15:58.958
I'll take this over.

16:05.464 --> 16:06.799
<i>When Kaga</i>

16:08.717 --> 16:10.594
<i>looks at a cute girl</i>

16:11.136 --> 16:12.429
<i>then looks back at me,</i>

16:12.888 --> 16:14.348
<i>I wonder how he feels.</i>

16:16.517 --> 16:19.561
<i>Why have I been fine until now?</i>

16:20.688 --> 16:23.524
<i>Why didn't I notice?</i>

16:24.733 --> 16:26.318
<i>Why did Kaga say</i>

16:26.860 --> 16:30.823
<i>that he's okay with me,</i>
<i>even when I look like this?</i>

16:30.906 --> 16:31.824
I love you,

16:32.700 --> 16:33.534
Ayumi.

16:34.702 --> 16:36.286
<i>Maybe he changed his mind</i>

16:37.371 --> 16:41.166
<i>and wishes that he never made</i>
<i>that confession to me.</i>

16:43.544 --> 16:45.087
<i>And yet, I'm still here,</i>

16:46.880 --> 16:49.049
<i>unable to find the words to answer him...</i>

16:54.263 --> 16:55.097
Ayumi.

16:57.141 --> 16:58.058
Ayumi!

17:24.251 --> 17:26.628
You're the real Zenko Umine, aren't you?

17:32.926 --> 17:34.595
Will you share information with me?

17:49.401 --> 17:50.402
Ayumi.

17:51.153 --> 17:53.655
The guys in class invited me.
Want do you think?

17:53.739 --> 17:56.033
GIANT PUDDING EATING CONTEST
10,000 YEN PRIZE

17:57.284 --> 17:58.118
Sorry.

17:58.869 --> 18:01.121
I have plans today, so...

18:03.457 --> 18:04.291
You're doing it.

18:05.501 --> 18:06.835
Wait a minute!

18:11.465 --> 18:12.299
This...

18:13.050 --> 18:14.384
is real, isn't it?

18:16.678 --> 18:17.513
Yes.

18:18.889 --> 18:20.641
People who have switched once

18:21.058 --> 18:22.976
can never return to their former self.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.022
Do you regret it?

18:29.525 --> 18:30.359
Regret?

18:33.237 --> 18:35.364
I don't have even a single drop of regret.

18:37.199 --> 18:38.951
I guess that's natural.

18:41.662 --> 18:44.248
A cute appearance, wonderful friends,

18:44.540 --> 18:45.874
a kind and caring family.

18:47.167 --> 18:49.878
You got everything you wished for.

18:52.548 --> 18:54.049
And Koshiro.

18:58.303 --> 18:59.388
But despite all that,

19:00.681 --> 19:02.683
you don't seem very happy, do you?

19:05.185 --> 19:07.354
I'm going to take a copy of this.

19:21.451 --> 19:23.996
<i>What would I do</i>
<i>if people think we don't match?</i>

19:25.330 --> 19:28.584
<i>If they laughed at Kaga because of me...</i>

19:28.792 --> 19:31.628
-Did you see that couple?
-That's hard to look at!

19:31.712 --> 19:33.046
Oh, stop it.

19:37.885 --> 19:38.719
Ayumi,

19:39.303 --> 19:41.430
I wonder if we look like a couple.

19:43.932 --> 19:47.144
I got wrapped up in the moment
and held your hand. Lucky me!

19:55.068 --> 19:56.111
You finally smiled.

20:02.784 --> 20:03.619
What did...

20:04.786 --> 20:05.913
you mean by that?

20:06.830 --> 20:07.664
That?

20:10.125 --> 20:11.126
You said...

20:13.337 --> 20:14.588
I was cute.

20:17.132 --> 20:19.343
There are plenty of other girls
who are cute.

20:23.555 --> 20:26.141
That's true.
There are lots of other cute girls.

20:27.267 --> 20:30.354
Before you switched,
I never thought Zenko Umine was cute.

20:31.897 --> 20:32.731
But,

20:34.107 --> 20:37.069
more than anyone else,
I like the Ayumi with me here now.

20:42.449 --> 20:44.284
If you met me while I looked like this,

20:47.162 --> 20:48.872
would you have said the same thing?

20:51.625 --> 20:52.834
If that were the case,

20:55.379 --> 20:56.880
I would discover your kindness

20:57.297 --> 20:59.174
faster than anyone else.

21:11.228 --> 21:12.229
<i>I see.</i>

21:14.356 --> 21:16.984
<i>The reason I was never concerned</i>
<i>about my looks</i>

21:18.318 --> 21:21.029
<i>was because Kaga was next to me</i>
<i>this whole time.</i>

21:30.539 --> 21:32.833
<i>I don't want to only be saved.</i>

21:33.083 --> 21:34.960
<i>I want to meet him halfway.</i>

21:37.337 --> 21:38.171
Let's go.

21:39.047 --> 21:43.051
<i>I can't be teasing kind people</i>
<i>like this anymore.</i>

21:45.429 --> 21:47.139
I'll decide by tomorrow.

21:49.766 --> 21:50.726
Tomorrow...

21:52.769 --> 21:54.896
if the Red Moon day ends safely,

21:57.232 --> 21:58.734
let me answer...

22:00.444 --> 22:01.278
your feelings.

22:03.447 --> 22:05.198
Yeah. Okay.

22:20.213 --> 22:21.340
But despite all that,

22:21.840 --> 22:23.925
you don't seem very happy, do you?

22:38.482 --> 22:42.110
Umine is the same shape as the pudding!

22:47.574 --> 22:49.117
I'm taking the picture!

22:49.201 --> 22:50.285
And... got it!

22:51.953 --> 22:53.789
Go, go! You can do it!

23:26.363 --> 23:27.989
Oh, Ayumi, welcome home. You must be hungry.

23:29.783 --> 23:33.203
I made lots of your favorite, broccoli!

23:39.876 --> 23:40.919
I don't like it.

23:44.631 --> 23:46.466
I don't like broccoli!

23:47.759 --> 23:50.429
My classmates, my mom,
everyone's the same!

23:50.679 --> 23:52.222
All you think about is her!

23:52.305 --> 23:55.308
You don't give a damn about me, do you?!

24:20.876 --> 24:21.710
What's the plan?

24:37.726 --> 24:39.644
You think this will work?

24:42.147 --> 24:43.398
It will succeed for sure.

24:45.775 --> 24:47.986
I know Kaga and Ayumi the best.

24:50.155 --> 24:51.531
<i>He knows Ayumi</i>

24:53.074 --> 24:54.367
<i>the best.</i>

24:59.789 --> 25:00.790
What's wrong?

25:03.251 --> 25:04.085
It's nothing.

25:26.233 --> 25:28.235
Ah, I'm starving.

25:28.944 --> 25:31.446
Ayumi, wanna go get doughnuts
on the way home?

25:34.157 --> 25:35.992
Nothing's gonna happen.

25:36.117 --> 25:37.994
Besides, we were informed by a bird.

25:38.870 --> 25:40.539
I know that, too.

25:42.499 --> 25:43.333
But...

25:44.042 --> 25:45.585
in case something does happen--

25:45.669 --> 25:48.171
Then I promise I will protect you.

25:50.298 --> 25:51.132
Okay? Okay.

25:54.469 --> 25:57.847
It's my turn to clean up, so wait for me
in the class after school.

26:18.910 --> 26:19.953
Koshiro.

26:20.745 --> 26:21.580
After school,

26:21.955 --> 26:23.623
I want you to go to the art room.

26:26.543 --> 26:27.502
Don't tell Kaga.

26:28.086 --> 26:28.920
Come alone.

26:30.463 --> 26:31.965
Can it wait until tomorrow?

26:35.010 --> 26:37.220
I guess you can't really believe me.

26:39.347 --> 26:41.349
I didn't believe you, either.

26:42.058 --> 26:42.892
I am...

26:44.352 --> 26:45.979
Ayumi Kohinata.

26:46.396 --> 26:47.981
I don't understand.

26:50.191 --> 26:51.693
Why wasn't I first?

26:53.236 --> 26:56.323
Why didn't I realize it was you
before Kaga?

26:57.490 --> 26:58.325
This whole time,

26:59.534 --> 27:01.494
I've been trying to suppress that regret.

27:06.041 --> 27:07.751
I want to talk to you one more time.

27:13.006 --> 27:13.840
I'll be waiting.

27:28.229 --> 27:29.064
See ya.

27:40.283 --> 27:41.951
Wait for me in class after school.

27:42.494 --> 27:44.204
I want you to go to the art room.

27:44.871 --> 27:45.955
Don't tell Kaga.

27:57.342 --> 27:59.094
I want to talk to you one more time.

28:00.512 --> 28:01.471
I'll be waiting.

28:11.606 --> 28:12.732
Sorry, Ayumi--

28:34.504 --> 28:37.340
ART ROOM

28:38.425 --> 28:39.384
<i>Kaga,</i>

28:39.759 --> 28:40.593
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

28:42.303 --> 28:43.263
<i>I want to...</i>

28:44.139 --> 28:47.851
<i>talk things out with Koshiro one-on-one.</i>

28:57.819 --> 28:59.320
Too bad.

29:03.116 --> 29:03.992
Ayumi?

29:10.248 --> 29:11.708
Ayumi's not coming back.

29:13.918 --> 29:15.837
What did you do to Ayumi?!

29:15.920 --> 29:16.796
Relax.

29:19.299 --> 29:21.092
I haven't done anything to her.

29:23.219 --> 29:24.345
For now.

29:27.557 --> 29:28.558
What does that mean?

29:31.686 --> 29:33.271
I dare you to lay a finger on her,

29:35.064 --> 29:36.149
but you'll regret it.

29:37.066 --> 29:39.277
Is Ayumi that precious to you?

29:43.448 --> 29:44.574
Then prove it.

29:49.579 --> 29:51.122
Must be nice to be you.

29:52.624 --> 29:54.250
Taking all the good things.

29:54.709 --> 29:55.543
Huh?

29:56.461 --> 29:59.297
No matter what I do,
everyone always goes to you.

30:00.423 --> 30:02.133
Now, you've taken Ayumi from me.

30:02.217 --> 30:04.052
What the hell are you talking about?

30:04.469 --> 30:06.179
You were the one who left her!

30:06.262 --> 30:07.680
You're one to talk.

30:09.057 --> 30:11.184
That's what you hoped for.

30:16.564 --> 30:19.234
Stop acting like my cheerleader.

30:20.527 --> 30:21.820
You've always liked her.

30:22.779 --> 30:23.613
Ayumi.

30:29.410 --> 30:32.247
Who gained the most from them switching?

30:36.042 --> 30:37.460
It wasn't Zenko Umine.

30:40.755 --> 30:41.589
It was you.

30:45.593 --> 30:46.678
Isn't it great?

30:48.096 --> 30:50.056
You got Ayumi to look at you.

30:52.141 --> 30:54.185
Who cares about winning or losing?!

30:55.353 --> 30:57.689
Have you once thought
about Ayumi's feelings?!

31:08.116 --> 31:09.450
That...

31:12.078 --> 31:13.329
doesn't matter.

31:16.082 --> 31:17.500
Koshiro!

31:20.837 --> 31:21.754
Kaga.

31:22.422 --> 31:23.548
Die.

31:24.632 --> 31:26.384
You jerk, I'm seriously gonna--

31:27.135 --> 31:27.969
Stop...

31:28.052 --> 31:28.928
Stop!

31:29.846 --> 31:31.055
Take a look.

31:33.641 --> 31:34.517
Kaga!

31:35.768 --> 31:37.979
Kaga's going to fall from there soon,

31:38.104 --> 31:40.189
all while thinking of switching with you.

31:41.399 --> 31:43.359
There's only one way to save him.

31:45.486 --> 31:47.822
You must not turn away from Kaga.

31:50.909 --> 31:51.743
Kaga!

31:52.911 --> 31:53.828
What are you doing?!

31:53.912 --> 31:55.038
Grow up!

31:55.121 --> 31:56.581
Let go of me!

31:56.664 --> 32:00.168
It'll be way better to be Kaga
than to look like you.

32:16.309 --> 32:18.019
I am not like you!

32:21.022 --> 32:23.399
Even if I can't go back to normal,

32:24.108 --> 32:25.485
even if I look like this,

32:27.278 --> 32:29.530
from now on I will make you suffer

32:29.906 --> 32:31.699
by being as happy as possible!

32:36.663 --> 32:38.665
Koshiro, stop! Run, Kaga!

33:08.945 --> 33:11.447
<i>No. I have to watch.</i>

33:41.978 --> 33:42.812
<i>What?</i>

33:45.148 --> 33:46.482
<i>I didn't...</i>

33:47.442 --> 33:48.276
<i>switch.</i>

33:50.028 --> 33:50.903
No...

33:52.530 --> 33:54.198
No!

33:54.282 --> 33:55.199
Koshiro!

34:05.585 --> 34:06.878
Kaga!

34:07.378 --> 34:09.338
Hey! Kaga!

34:10.757 --> 34:11.924
Kaga!

34:15.053 --> 34:17.055
Wake up, Kaga!

34:17.138 --> 34:19.348
-Koshiro...
-Kaga!

34:21.726 --> 34:22.852
Koshiro.

34:31.277 --> 34:32.195
Koshiro.

35:05.478 --> 35:06.938
What the hell is going on?

35:13.277 --> 35:14.112
No...

35:21.077 --> 35:21.994
Kaga?
