WEBVTT

00:00.924 --> 00:02.257
Previously on "Manhattan"...

00:02.411 --> 00:05.996
Robert Oppenheimer's having an affair.

00:07.047 --> 00:09.432
- We have to do something.
- We?

00:09.466 --> 00:12.051
Frank Winter was a problem.
You made him disappear.

00:12.086 --> 00:12.953
Beuker. Joseph Beuker.

00:12.955 --> 00:14.838
Charlie Isaacs.

00:14.872 --> 00:18.375
I need an address for a
woman who died last year.

00:18.426 --> 00:20.961
I'm trying to contact her next of kin.

00:21.012 --> 00:25.181
I spoke with miss
Tatlock on the telephone,

00:25.216 --> 00:27.884
and I said some cruel things.

00:29.553 --> 00:31.054
I hereby declare you a citizen

00:31.105 --> 00:32.522
of the United States of America.

00:32.555 --> 00:33.890
Welcome home, son.

00:36.277 --> 00:38.561
Is that the man you remember?

00:38.613 --> 00:42.198
Brooklyn... no ideology,
no beliefs beyond himself,

00:42.233 --> 00:43.817
thinks he's in a spy picture.

00:43.868 --> 00:45.735
What are you doing?
Give that to me. Give...

00:45.786 --> 00:47.654
Perseus believes that he is
more intelligent than he is,

00:47.705 --> 00:49.406
which makes him susceptible to flattery.

00:49.457 --> 00:51.491
Those notes are not about you.

00:51.542 --> 00:53.543
Well, I guess that there's
another Soviet spy on the hill.

00:57.715 --> 00:59.716
President Roosevelt is
assembling a target committee

00:59.750 --> 01:01.501
to decide how the gadget's used

01:01.552 --> 01:04.587
and who it's going to be dropped on.

01:04.638 --> 01:08.058
You can't make me fix
Charlie Isaacs' broken bomb.

01:08.092 --> 01:09.843
I want a seat on the target committee.

01:09.894 --> 01:11.177
I can get the scientists a seat,

01:11.228 --> 01:12.512
but it won't be you.

01:12.563 --> 01:13.897
What if someone dipped a brush

01:13.931 --> 01:16.182
in the wrong can of paint?

01:16.233 --> 01:17.901
Convince the target committee

01:17.935 --> 01:21.354
to demonstrate the bomb
on an uninhabited island.

01:21.356 --> 01:23.573
We're all betting on him now.

01:25.000 --> 01:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:42.793 --> 01:44.928
Attention. All technical work

01:44.962 --> 01:46.930
must be completed before
the dignitaries arrive

01:46.964 --> 01:48.798
for tomorrow's committee meeting.

02:41.059 --> 02:46.192
Synced corrected by: -ROBTOR-
www.Addic7ed.com

03:25.279 --> 03:27.230
Frank.

03:27.281 --> 03:30.033
I got my hands on the
target committee list.

03:30.067 --> 03:33.453
Fourteen names, most
of them DC regulars.

03:34.705 --> 03:36.489
These guys wage war for a living.

03:36.540 --> 03:38.658
You really think they're
gonna care what I have to say?

03:38.709 --> 03:40.410
Break a leg, Dr. Isaacs.

03:40.461 --> 03:42.829
The meeting's happening
in the shadow of your test.

03:42.831 --> 03:44.998
In that room, you are the authority.

03:45.049 --> 03:46.666
I built them a $2 billion car.

03:46.700 --> 03:48.585
Now I'm gonna tell them
to leave it in the garage?

03:48.636 --> 03:50.670
No, no. You tell them to drop
it on an uninhabited island

03:50.704 --> 03:52.172
instead of a military target.

03:52.223 --> 03:53.840
Fly in the Japanese high command,

03:53.842 --> 03:55.742
give them all front-row seats...

03:55.776 --> 03:58.077
White flagving er
hirohito's palace in a week.

03:58.112 --> 03:59.345
Everybody wins.

03:59.347 --> 04:01.264
Hirohito isn't Harry Truman.

04:01.315 --> 04:02.415
His people think he's a god.

04:02.449 --> 04:04.117
Gods don't bow to armies.

04:04.151 --> 04:05.919
You think he's just gonna
fold after a warning shot?

04:05.953 --> 04:07.403
It's not a warning shot.

04:07.438 --> 04:09.255
This is not even another bomb.

04:11.158 --> 04:12.609
It's a second sun.

04:12.660 --> 04:14.911
The emperor is not
surrendering to the army,

04:14.945 --> 04:17.779
he's surrendering to the...
The power of the universe.

04:20.668 --> 04:24.204
To be honest, I wish it was you
facing the firing squad, Frank.

04:24.238 --> 04:25.972
Makes the test look easy.

04:26.006 --> 04:27.874
Just remember, when you
first get into the meeting,

04:27.876 --> 04:29.759
keep quiet, let them exhaust themselves

04:29.793 --> 04:32.045
fighting over which
military target to take out.

04:32.096 --> 04:33.930
Yeah, and then wait for
the last word. I know.

04:33.964 --> 04:36.216
Yeah, you gotta make an
emotional appeal, Charlie.

04:36.267 --> 04:38.134
They got one chance
to show restraint here,

04:38.185 --> 04:40.937
win the war without
any more loss of life.

04:40.971 --> 04:44.474
I'm not sure the army's losing a lot
of sleep over Japanese casualties.

04:44.525 --> 04:46.893
Okay, well, come up with your own angle.

04:46.944 --> 04:49.896
Try to... try to make it personal.

04:49.898 --> 04:52.031
- Make it personal.
- Yeah.

04:56.787 --> 04:59.239
If we detonate a base
near a populated area,

04:59.290 --> 05:03.910
there'll be, what, 50,000 casualties?

05:03.912 --> 05:05.461
How many children?

05:06.881 --> 05:10.383
Jesus, I don't know. Um... 20,000.

05:12.670 --> 05:14.387
What about Joey?

05:16.173 --> 05:17.924
My kid, their kids.

05:17.926 --> 05:20.593
If we don't show mercy
with our wand in this war,

05:20.644 --> 05:24.681
how can we expect anyone to show
our children mercy in the next one?

05:26.600 --> 05:29.485
That's it. Say that.

05:30.487 --> 05:31.604
Hey, Frank...

05:31.655 --> 05:32.989
Where are you bunking up now

05:33.023 --> 05:34.774
that you're back from the desert?

05:34.825 --> 05:36.943
- Starting tonight, my new office.
- New?

05:36.945 --> 05:39.162
I imagine I have you to thank for that?

05:39.196 --> 05:40.613
It only took two months
to convince Oppenheimer

05:40.615 --> 05:42.615
you were an improvement
over a drunk foreigner.

05:42.617 --> 05:44.784
The capsule got stuck in the tamper.

05:44.835 --> 05:46.786
- Team leader's on the phone.
- Jesus, I'm coming.

05:46.837 --> 05:50.039
- Just make sure you get the last word.
- Yes, I know.

06:04.271 --> 06:06.856
Welcome back to the cheap seats.

06:06.891 --> 06:09.442
Don't fret, we saved your desk.

06:15.416 --> 06:17.450
Dr. Winter.

06:18.702 --> 06:21.454
Theodore Sinclair.
Welcome to little boy.

06:22.590 --> 06:24.674
Well, we have a job.

06:24.708 --> 06:27.210
We'll do it to the best of our ability.

06:27.261 --> 06:30.096
And if we are lucky, it
will all be for nothing.

06:33.100 --> 06:36.469
The implosion gadget,
it's the warning shot.

06:36.471 --> 06:37.854
Little boy's only on deck

06:37.888 --> 06:41.357
if the Japanese don't heed that warning.

06:41.392 --> 06:43.693
Let's just all hope
that day never comes.

06:46.480 --> 06:48.698
Not exactly St. Crispin's day.

07:21.982 --> 07:23.399
Victor, please...

07:23.434 --> 07:25.351
Stay for dessert.

07:32.943 --> 07:34.410
Your job is to listen.

07:34.445 --> 07:36.696
We're hoping your
expertise will prove useful

07:36.698 --> 07:38.915
in translating technical information

07:38.949 --> 07:42.085
concerning the current
status of the gadget.

07:42.119 --> 07:44.120
Our gadget or the Soviets'?

08:27.889 --> 08:29.923
Yes, Dr. Barath. I will
try to put you through,

08:29.974 --> 08:33.010
but there are so many calls
coming in from out there.

08:38.482 --> 08:39.732
Hello?

08:40.985 --> 08:43.654
- Mr. Tatlock?
- Yes?

08:45.023 --> 08:47.358
This is Abigail Isaacs.

08:47.409 --> 08:50.194
Miss Isaacs, you received my letter.

08:50.196 --> 08:51.862
Yes.

08:51.913 --> 08:56.283
"Let 100 mothers cry, but not my mother.

08:56.334 --> 08:58.952
But better my mother than me. "

08:59.003 --> 09:01.588
Do you know who said that?

09:01.623 --> 09:03.290
George Washington... Kidding.

09:03.341 --> 09:06.543
It was an arab. I love arabs.

09:06.594 --> 09:09.880
Great fighters, highly quotable.

09:09.931 --> 09:12.599
And I've heard that particular adage

09:12.634 --> 09:16.186
is a favorite of your
boss at the kremlin, right?

09:19.357 --> 09:21.809
You must think that you
know what happens next.

09:21.860 --> 09:25.112
But we yanks, we're
such a young country.

09:25.146 --> 09:26.563
We're still finding our legs.

09:26.565 --> 09:28.982
No idea what we wanna
be when we grow up.

09:29.033 --> 09:32.069
It makes us...

09:32.120 --> 09:33.821
Unpredictable.

09:44.332 --> 09:48.669
Ah, you were so good, Mr. green.

09:48.720 --> 09:50.754
You're so thorough.

09:50.805 --> 09:52.089
Burned everything,

09:52.140 --> 09:54.425
just like they taught you in Moscow.

09:55.677 --> 09:59.430
Buried the ashes in the yard.

09:59.481 --> 10:02.649
It's just that we're getting
better and better at...

10:02.684 --> 10:04.651
Unburying things.

10:08.440 --> 10:10.691
So, what's in Brooklyn?

10:13.361 --> 10:15.829
Wasn't our, uh, uranium

10:15.864 --> 10:18.582
stockpiled in a warehouse there?

10:19.918 --> 10:21.335
Um, staten island.

10:21.369 --> 10:25.289
Staten island. Anyway,
that was a long time ago.

10:25.291 --> 10:27.291
Too obvious for a man of your pedigree.

10:27.293 --> 10:29.293
So, what is it?

10:29.344 --> 10:32.513
Uh... maybe Brooklyn's not a borough.

10:32.547 --> 10:38.018
Maybe it's a code for
a military maneuver.

10:38.052 --> 10:43.774
Or maybe... maybe Brooklyn... is a man.

10:44.776 --> 10:46.226
Your Ace in the hole,

10:46.277 --> 10:48.896
your atomic spy.

10:48.947 --> 10:52.366
He's a new yorker, isn't he?

11:03.878 --> 11:06.129
Thank you, Dr. Oppenheimer.

11:14.756 --> 11:17.841
I'm sure you feel like
a war widow, Mrs. Isaacs.

11:17.843 --> 11:20.427
I've made unreasonable
demands on Charlie,

11:20.478 --> 11:23.514
but I promise to return him undamaged

11:23.565 --> 11:25.232
in 48 hours.

11:28.436 --> 11:33.357
Sir, I spoke to professor
John Tatlock this morning.

11:34.576 --> 11:36.276
Jean's father.

11:36.327 --> 11:39.329
I wanted to know more
about his daughter...

11:40.949 --> 11:42.699
And her death.

11:45.420 --> 11:47.704
What business is it of yours?

11:50.174 --> 11:53.544
Well, I overheard some of
your calls at the switchboard.

11:55.930 --> 11:58.382
Mr. Tatlock says that the handwriting

11:58.384 --> 12:00.767
on the note wasn't Jean's

12:00.802 --> 12:04.555
and that someone may
have staged the scene

12:04.606 --> 12:07.224
to look like a suicide.

12:15.199 --> 12:18.402
You loved her.

12:18.404 --> 12:21.572
Don't you wanna know
if someone killed her?

12:31.049 --> 12:34.167
You are a...

12:34.218 --> 12:36.253
Reasonably intelligent woman.

12:36.255 --> 12:37.804
Do you know the difference

12:37.839 --> 12:40.340
between a conjecture and a theorem?

12:40.391 --> 12:41.642
Allow me.

12:44.262 --> 12:47.981
I may conjecture that colonel
darrow had Jean murdered

12:48.016 --> 12:50.267
to keep me on the project.

12:50.318 --> 12:51.818
What?

12:51.853 --> 12:55.072
But I have nothing to test, to prove.

12:56.908 --> 12:58.442
Therefore, no theorem.

13:00.495 --> 13:03.196
We'll never know.

13:03.247 --> 13:06.166
That's our world.

13:06.200 --> 13:08.452
Uncertainty.

13:11.339 --> 13:12.589
Nuance.

13:17.962 --> 13:20.213
No need to return to the switchboard.

13:20.264 --> 13:21.548
You're removed.

13:25.603 --> 13:27.638
We anticipate a temperature rise about,

13:27.640 --> 13:29.389
uh, six degrees every three seconds.

13:29.440 --> 13:32.025
Dr. Winter.

13:32.060 --> 13:34.478
I requested new composites,

13:34.480 --> 13:35.646
but Donlon says we've already blown

13:35.697 --> 13:37.648
our metallurgy budget for the month.

13:37.699 --> 13:40.484
Yeah. Well, I hope you didn't
spend it all in one place.

13:40.486 --> 13:44.071
Apparently most of it went to a
laboratory in Rochester, New York.

13:44.122 --> 13:46.323
What's in Rochester?

13:46.374 --> 13:48.241
Um, you know what?

13:48.292 --> 13:49.660
It'll take me a couple of days

13:49.711 --> 13:51.044
to get back up to speed,

13:51.079 --> 13:52.713
but I'll definitely get into it.

13:55.917 --> 13:58.552
Is he always so unfocused?

14:00.972 --> 14:02.639
He'll be back.

14:18.156 --> 14:19.356
Abigail.

14:19.407 --> 14:21.358
This has been a complicated day.

14:21.409 --> 14:26.029
Maybe we can worship
together later in the week.

14:26.080 --> 14:29.916
Did the army have anything to
do with Jean Tatlock's death?

14:29.951 --> 14:33.537
Miss Tatlock took her
own life, as you know.

14:33.539 --> 14:35.005
Colonel, I know she didn't.

14:43.965 --> 14:46.516
What exactly did your husband tell you?

14:49.303 --> 14:52.606
Not my husband. Robert Oppenheimer.

14:57.145 --> 14:59.062
Then it's true, isn't it?

15:00.565 --> 15:02.733
And you knew... You knew all along,

15:02.784 --> 15:07.120
and you let me beg god for forgiveness.

15:07.155 --> 15:09.322
Do you like to watch women beg?

15:09.373 --> 15:10.907
Did you watch Jean Tatlock beg?

15:10.909 --> 15:12.659
You're confused, Abby.

15:12.710 --> 15:15.128
Just because you're an
officer in the army...

15:17.081 --> 15:20.333
I'll tell Charlie. I'll
just tell the police.

15:31.012 --> 15:32.062
Come with me.

15:34.398 --> 15:36.016
Where?

15:37.018 --> 15:38.735
Confession.

15:50.615 --> 15:52.165
What is this place?

15:52.200 --> 15:54.367
My sanctuary.

16:17.642 --> 16:20.310
I'm not telling you how to do your job.

16:20.312 --> 16:23.280
I'm just telling you that
there's a job to be done.

16:25.867 --> 16:27.317
Frank Winter was a problem.

16:27.368 --> 16:29.452
You made him disappear.

16:30.655 --> 16:34.658
Miss Tatlock needs to go.

16:34.660 --> 16:37.077
What are you suggesting?

16:37.128 --> 16:40.664
You're a soldier, right?

16:40.666 --> 16:43.550
We're at war.

16:43.584 --> 16:46.219
What do you know about war?

16:46.254 --> 16:47.838
If you can't handle it,

16:47.889 --> 16:53.093
my father has associates in St. Louis.

16:55.096 --> 16:58.265
You should be careful whom
you accuse, Mrs. Isaacs.

16:58.316 --> 17:01.351
And may the lord forgive us all.

17:10.823 --> 17:12.824
Did you find him at a meeting?

17:15.444 --> 17:18.163
Or did your man just waltz
into the consulate general?

17:20.415 --> 17:24.117
Brooklyn is in kings
county. Maybe he's British.

17:24.119 --> 17:25.420
Maybe you're Brooklyn.

17:28.339 --> 17:29.958
Warmer?

17:32.261 --> 17:35.129
Colder?

17:35.131 --> 17:37.682
Please, Victor, don't make me angry.

17:48.394 --> 17:49.811
Help me.

17:49.862 --> 17:52.530
Get me some rat poison,

17:52.565 --> 17:53.982
a razor blade.

17:55.367 --> 17:58.152
Do you know what the water cure is?

17:58.154 --> 17:59.487
They pour water into your nostrils.

17:59.538 --> 18:01.406
You drown on dry land.

18:03.576 --> 18:04.659
I don't know what you're doing here,

18:04.661 --> 18:06.828
but you're not one of them.

18:06.879 --> 18:09.464
Think of the people who love you.

18:12.167 --> 18:14.552
How would your son feel if
he knew you'd be tortured?

18:17.506 --> 18:19.090
How do you know I have a son?

18:20.926 --> 18:23.261
Or... or a daughter.

18:23.312 --> 18:25.263
A wife.

18:25.314 --> 18:28.850
You have a family. I
can see it in your eyes.

18:28.901 --> 18:32.020
Their father, their husband,

18:32.054 --> 18:35.023
he's a merciful man, I know.

18:35.074 --> 18:36.691
I see it.

18:50.923 --> 18:53.958
I think... I think Victor knows me...

18:54.009 --> 18:56.761
Things about me.

18:56.795 --> 18:59.881
If he does, maybe Brooklyn knows me.

18:59.932 --> 19:01.549
Maybe I know him.

19:07.056 --> 19:08.973
How did they find him?

19:09.024 --> 19:10.391
It must've been that Indian boy.

19:10.442 --> 19:12.226
And you're sure that it's him?

19:12.228 --> 19:14.979
Yes, he's a handler.
His name is Victor green.

19:15.030 --> 19:16.898
Well, I already have a
pass for the test site.

19:16.900 --> 19:19.400
I can leave now.

19:19.451 --> 19:22.236
No. No, you and perseus,
you wait for the convoy,

19:22.238 --> 19:24.405
and you get out to the
test site as planned.

19:24.456 --> 19:26.574
- We can't arouse suspicion.
- What if he gives us up?

19:26.625 --> 19:29.827
He won't crack. Even if they
torture him, he won't crack.

19:29.878 --> 19:31.996
Are you sure about that?

19:32.047 --> 19:35.083
I know men like him. I know
how they've been trained.

19:35.085 --> 19:38.002
He... he killed a g-2 agent.

19:38.053 --> 19:40.805
He risked his own life so that you
could finish what you've started.

19:40.839 --> 19:43.257
Yes, but if he trades up and
I don't make it off the hill,

19:43.259 --> 19:45.310
I won't be able to finish anything.

19:45.344 --> 19:49.430
Listen to me. Nothing changes.

19:49.481 --> 19:52.767
You wait for the convoy and
you take it out to the site.

19:52.769 --> 19:54.268
Okay.

19:54.270 --> 19:56.270
Do you have the schematics
for the circuits?

19:56.322 --> 20:00.325
I don't need the schematics.
I built the circuits.

20:05.280 --> 20:07.782
Do you understand what
happens if the test succeeds?

20:07.833 --> 20:11.119
It won't. I won't crack, either.

20:11.170 --> 20:13.538
Okay?

20:15.624 --> 20:18.209
So, do you have a dossier on Paul?

20:18.260 --> 20:22.597
Did Brooklyn think that
he was recruitable as well?

20:23.799 --> 20:25.717
It turns out we have a big tent

20:25.768 --> 20:27.769
and a welcome mat, too.

20:30.389 --> 20:34.058
Only 20 men on this hill
know that I have a son.

20:34.109 --> 20:35.560
Hogarth is one of them,

20:35.611 --> 20:40.064
but, uh, I rather
doubt his double agency.

20:40.115 --> 20:42.450
Even his single agency was shit.

20:45.954 --> 20:48.656
You know, you're not the
only one with a kid, Paul.

20:52.044 --> 20:55.663
Victor has a daughter. Eleanor. Adopted.

20:55.714 --> 20:57.331
Should be about 30 now?

20:57.383 --> 21:00.001
On the rolls at the
university of Pittsburgh?

21:03.555 --> 21:05.840
But Eleanor fell off
the map a few years ago.

21:05.891 --> 21:10.478
And so where is she, Victor?
Have you heard from her lately?

21:12.347 --> 21:14.348
No?

21:14.350 --> 21:16.184
Don't worry, director
hoover has all kinds of ways

21:16.186 --> 21:17.685
to track people down these days.

21:17.736 --> 21:20.571
I predict a tearful reunion.

21:28.580 --> 21:31.199
I need your assurance
you'll leave her out of this.

21:32.951 --> 21:36.421
In exchange for...

21:36.455 --> 21:38.122
A name.

21:50.352 --> 21:54.439
Your colleague, he came
to us two years ago.

21:56.191 --> 21:57.975
He told us you have a son.

22:04.149 --> 22:05.700
His name was Sid Liao.

22:11.990 --> 22:14.158
You're welcome.

22:17.996 --> 22:19.797
Take one for the road.

22:23.886 --> 22:27.171
Have as many pastries as you like.

22:29.808 --> 22:31.476
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

22:33.011 --> 22:34.812
While I have your attention,

22:34.847 --> 22:39.317
I want to tell you about a
study I've been conducting

22:39.351 --> 22:42.520
in partnership with one
of the university labs

22:42.571 --> 22:46.607
on the environmental
effects of the Trinity test.

22:50.078 --> 22:51.996
When, in the next 48 hours,

22:52.030 --> 22:55.199
you detonate the world's
first atomic weapon,

22:55.250 --> 22:58.953
you will propel radioactive
particles high into the sky

22:58.955 --> 23:03.291
that will eventually
fall back down to earth.

23:03.293 --> 23:05.843
Let's give this phenomenon a name.

23:05.878 --> 23:09.180
Let's call it...

23:09.214 --> 23:12.550
"Fallout. "

23:13.552 --> 23:14.936
Fallout.

23:17.272 --> 23:19.557
Despite all the work that
you've done here on the hill,

23:19.608 --> 23:22.193
we know almost nothing about how fallout

23:22.227 --> 23:24.695
will be absorbed back into the earth

23:24.730 --> 23:27.148
or maybe into the human body.

23:27.199 --> 23:30.401
Consider, for example, the
lanthanum radioactive tests

23:30.452 --> 23:33.487
you've been doing in the bayo canyon.

23:33.489 --> 23:35.373
Incidentally, that muffin you're eating,

23:35.407 --> 23:37.742
that was baked this morning
from corn that was harvested

23:37.793 --> 23:39.043
from that very area.

23:42.130 --> 23:43.998
Now, Trinity could produce

23:44.000 --> 23:48.169
100,000 times more fallout
than any prior experiment.

23:48.171 --> 23:49.921
And we have no idea what this might mean

23:49.972 --> 23:54.258
for the surrounding farms,
for the water sources,

23:54.309 --> 23:57.011
for the water we drink here on the hill.

23:57.062 --> 23:59.263
Our research has only just begun.

23:59.314 --> 24:01.682
But for everything we don't know,

24:01.733 --> 24:03.434
there is one thing that we do...

24:03.485 --> 24:07.071
The extent of the fallout
will depend on the weather,

24:07.105 --> 24:10.575
how strong the winds are and
which direction they blow.

24:10.609 --> 24:13.361
The weather will determine the magnitude

24:13.363 --> 24:15.029
of the effect of Trinity.

24:15.031 --> 24:17.365
And unless the weather agrees with us,

24:17.416 --> 24:19.283
we won't move forward.

24:19.334 --> 24:22.086
I expect you all to know Dr.
Winter's report chapter and verse

24:22.120 --> 24:24.005
by the time you get to the test site.

24:38.971 --> 24:43.391
So, those muffins, did they
really come from the bayo canyon?

24:43.442 --> 24:46.227
The px. You think I took up baking?

24:49.314 --> 24:51.899
An oriental was spying for the Russians?

24:51.901 --> 24:54.235
Uh, according to our guest.

24:54.286 --> 24:57.822
You wanna explain to me how
a ghost killed Avram Fisher?

24:57.873 --> 25:00.124
Victor might have killed him.

25:00.158 --> 25:02.576
I don't think Sid Liao is their spy.

25:02.578 --> 25:04.829
Was their spy.

25:04.880 --> 25:07.081
I know there was a
time that I doubted him,

25:07.132 --> 25:10.084
but Sid Liao was just a
desperate chap in over his head.

25:10.086 --> 25:14.588
There are 428 men on your payrolls

25:14.590 --> 25:16.424
who were born or raised in Brooklyn,

25:16.426 --> 25:18.643
72 on this hill.

25:18.677 --> 25:20.511
Maybe we should consider
delaying the test

25:20.562 --> 25:21.979
until that list can be narrowed.

25:22.014 --> 25:23.931
In two days, the president
of the United States

25:23.933 --> 25:25.182
will be in potsdam, Germany,

25:25.233 --> 25:26.934
sitting across from Joseph Stalin

25:26.985 --> 25:28.936
with the map of the world between them.

25:28.938 --> 25:31.105
Truman's gonna draw lines on that map.

25:31.107 --> 25:33.524
Clear, bright, lines.

25:33.575 --> 25:35.109
Delay is out of the question.

25:35.111 --> 25:37.194
Sir, I know I'm new to this,

25:37.245 --> 25:39.163
but what if it's not just
information that they're after?

25:39.197 --> 25:41.115
We just shipped a billion
dollars' worth of plutonium

25:41.166 --> 25:42.366
into the middle of the desert.

25:42.417 --> 25:44.502
What if Brooklyn stole it? What if...

25:44.536 --> 25:49.006
I don't know, what if he manages
to disrupt the test somehow?

25:49.041 --> 25:51.208
What would the president
have to show Stalin then?

25:58.300 --> 26:01.018
I will speak with Mr. green myself.

26:07.776 --> 26:09.193
Make sure we have more castings.

26:09.227 --> 26:10.978
As many as it takes.

26:11.029 --> 26:13.698
All right. Go, go! Kiss
your kids good night.

26:14.900 --> 26:16.484
Hopefully, not for good.

26:17.869 --> 26:20.404
Circus leaves town 10:00 A.M. sharp.

26:23.125 --> 26:25.326
Fritz.

26:30.082 --> 26:32.416
You ready for the target committee?

26:32.467 --> 26:37.171
No. You help me prep on
the way out to Trinity.

26:37.173 --> 26:38.672
I'm...

26:38.674 --> 26:40.558
I'm not going to Trinity.

26:43.261 --> 26:45.346
Dr. Isaacs, we need your approval for...

26:45.348 --> 26:47.264
Hang on. Sit down.

26:47.315 --> 26:48.566
Sit down.

26:53.488 --> 26:55.489
Fritz...

26:58.110 --> 27:01.195
I know you've been
through hell and I'm sorry.

27:01.197 --> 27:04.698
No, no, I'm sorry.

27:04.700 --> 27:08.953
I'm sorry that I won't be
able to help you anymore.

27:09.004 --> 27:11.789
I'm grateful for the opportunities
you've given me here, Charlie,

27:11.840 --> 27:16.927
but I just... I've had
enough death for one lifetime.

28:33.955 --> 28:35.956
How long have they been in there?

28:41.513 --> 28:45.466
I heard you were a patient man.

28:45.468 --> 28:49.637
That your Patience led to the
capture of six enemy combatants.

28:55.026 --> 28:57.695
So how'd you come to all this?

28:57.729 --> 29:00.197
You're some sort of... Psychiatrist.

29:00.232 --> 29:02.399
Ah, talking cure.

29:02.450 --> 29:04.818
You're a long way from
Freud's couch, doctor.

29:04.870 --> 29:06.403
Well, diseases of the mind

29:06.454 --> 29:09.707
aren't confined to asylums, Paul.

29:09.741 --> 29:11.709
They rewrite maps.

29:11.743 --> 29:13.544
Look at Hitler.

29:13.578 --> 29:16.413
Stalin. The world's full of sick...

29:19.885 --> 29:21.886
Clean it up.

29:58.995 --> 30:01.913
Abby? Sorry, I should've told you

30:01.948 --> 30:03.582
I wouldn't be back last night.

30:03.616 --> 30:05.584
Everyone needed five minutes.

30:05.618 --> 30:09.204
Now I only have five
minutes. Where's my suitcase?

30:09.206 --> 30:11.707
Hey, could I get a
sandwich for the road?

30:11.709 --> 30:13.342
Have your men do it.

30:14.627 --> 30:15.761
What?

30:15.795 --> 30:17.379
Your men in St. Louis.

30:17.430 --> 30:19.765
Your father's men who
took care of Jean Tatlock.

30:19.799 --> 30:21.049
Have them do it.

30:27.857 --> 30:29.274
Abby.

30:29.308 --> 30:30.392
Colonel darrow records

30:30.443 --> 30:31.610
every conversation in his office.

30:31.644 --> 30:33.228
Did you know that? I didn't.

30:34.647 --> 30:36.531
I heard you, Charlie.

30:44.457 --> 30:49.411
It was a bluff...

30:49.462 --> 30:50.996
To light a fire under darrow,

30:51.047 --> 30:52.164
and then he...

30:52.215 --> 30:54.666
Took things too far.

30:54.717 --> 30:57.335
He did, not me.

30:57.387 --> 31:00.806
Do you think a jury cares
whose hands are dirtier?

31:00.840 --> 31:06.511
Jesus. Abby, the
decisions I make every...

31:06.562 --> 31:09.147
I'm holding a hundred thousand
lives in my dirty hands.

31:09.182 --> 31:12.651
In my position, you see
things through to the end,

31:12.685 --> 31:14.352
things the world might not understand,

31:14.404 --> 31:16.738
but because you believe
in something bigger.

31:20.076 --> 31:23.245
You let me believe that I was
responsible for a woman's death.

31:25.081 --> 31:27.249
You're a monster.

31:36.509 --> 31:39.544
God, I don't expect you to understand.

31:39.595 --> 31:41.680
No. No, of course not.

31:41.714 --> 31:45.967
How could I? I just have
the one life in my hands.

31:46.018 --> 31:48.019
I gotta go.

31:48.054 --> 31:50.138
We'll talk about it when I get back.

31:50.140 --> 31:51.723
Joey!

31:55.228 --> 31:56.728
Where's Joey?

31:57.897 --> 31:59.648
He's on his way to brookline.

31:59.699 --> 32:01.483
I don't have time for
games, Abby. Where is he?

32:01.534 --> 32:02.901
Juanita is driving him.

32:02.952 --> 32:05.036
He's going to live with my parents.

32:17.049 --> 32:20.886
The colonel may have
me trapped here, but...

32:20.920 --> 32:23.338
My son will have no part of this.

32:23.340 --> 32:27.342
You sent my son

32:27.344 --> 32:29.728
3,000 miles away from me

32:29.762 --> 32:31.730
with the goddamn maid?

32:31.764 --> 32:33.598
I was seeing things through.

32:33.649 --> 32:35.901
Maybe I'm just as much
to blame as you are,

32:35.935 --> 32:36.902
but Joey deserves better.

32:36.936 --> 32:38.520
Stolen away from his father,

32:38.571 --> 32:40.105
that's what he deserves?

32:40.156 --> 32:41.907
I'm keeping him safe from you

32:41.941 --> 32:43.859
just like you should've been
kept safe from your father!

32:43.861 --> 32:45.861
You think I won't get in
the car and bring him back?

32:45.863 --> 32:48.363
Your test is in 24 hours.

32:48.365 --> 32:50.332
You think I don't know
which way you'll drive?

33:10.603 --> 33:12.771
Is this how they teach
you how to stage a suicide

33:12.805 --> 33:14.272
in medical school?

33:15.358 --> 33:16.892
This one's a challenge.

33:18.394 --> 33:20.946
The stable's a unique venue.

33:20.980 --> 33:24.533
Forty percent check
out in their own house.

33:25.985 --> 33:27.953
I prefer bathrooms.

33:27.987 --> 33:30.205
It's a good place to open a wrist.

33:31.207 --> 33:33.241
Or drown.

33:33.243 --> 33:36.077
In the end, it's not
the scene that matters,

33:36.128 --> 33:37.495
it's the story.

33:37.547 --> 33:39.247
It's gotta be credible.

33:39.249 --> 33:42.300
In this case...

33:42.335 --> 33:44.753
A bankrupt, small-time rancher

33:44.755 --> 33:47.422
holes up in his remote barn.

33:47.424 --> 33:48.673
How about this for a story?

33:48.724 --> 33:50.926
A commissioned officer
executes a suspect?

33:50.928 --> 33:54.095
The man who could have told
us the identity of Brooklyn.

33:54.146 --> 33:56.181
There was no judge, there was no jury...

33:56.232 --> 33:57.849
Do you think I'm happy we're here?

33:57.900 --> 34:00.769
A Soviet spy in the hand
is worth ten in the ground.

34:00.771 --> 34:03.772
We could've used him.
Angry man, your colonel.

34:03.823 --> 34:07.025
Not a lot of restraint
when it comes to communists.

34:07.076 --> 34:10.661
He'll make a hell of a senator
someday. You wait and see.

34:10.696 --> 34:12.112
Grab that foot.

34:15.083 --> 34:16.368
He won't mind.

34:23.876 --> 34:26.844
We're gonna pull on three. Ready?

34:26.879 --> 34:28.847
One, two, three.

34:35.054 --> 34:37.856
You know, I agreed to translate
scientific information.

34:37.889 --> 34:39.808
Um...

34:39.810 --> 34:42.476
Tell the colonel my tenure is over.

34:42.478 --> 34:44.529
The colonel, forget him. He
doesn't even know you're here.

34:44.563 --> 34:46.614
No, I wanted you to see this.

34:49.452 --> 34:50.652
Why?

34:50.703 --> 34:52.654
World war ii is over, Paul.

34:52.705 --> 34:54.489
The next war's already started.

34:54.491 --> 34:57.375
It's gonna be unlike
any conflict in history.

34:57.410 --> 35:01.663
It'll be waged silently
by men like you and me.

35:01.714 --> 35:04.499
- I'm a physicist.
- I'm a doctor.

35:04.501 --> 35:08.670
We're forming a new breed
of intelligence organization,

35:08.721 --> 35:13.391
one with a more centralized approach.

35:13.426 --> 35:17.345
We have connections, money, pedigree...

35:17.396 --> 35:19.064
Things you like.

35:21.934 --> 35:23.685
You'll get used to the things you don't.

35:49.261 --> 35:53.098
I saw them load the crate
into the back of the truck.

35:53.132 --> 35:56.384
Well, how do you know it was a body?

35:56.435 --> 35:59.471
What else are they gonna carry
out of an interrogation room?

35:59.522 --> 36:01.139
Jesus.

36:01.190 --> 36:02.640
Prepare to clear way

36:02.692 --> 36:04.225
for convoy departure to Trinity site.

36:04.227 --> 36:06.277
That's the, uh... That's the convoy.

36:06.312 --> 36:07.395
I bet... I better go.

36:07.446 --> 36:09.230
No. No!

36:09.281 --> 36:12.317
You're not going with the convoy.

36:12.368 --> 36:14.819
You and perseus are gonna
go out there on your own.

36:14.870 --> 36:16.571
What? Why?

36:16.573 --> 36:18.740
I'm making an adjustment to the plan.

36:18.791 --> 36:20.658
If we all we do is sabotage the gadget,

36:20.710 --> 36:22.577
- they'll just keep rebuilding it.
- Maybe.

36:22.579 --> 36:24.412
But it's gonna take them months
to figure out what went wrong.

36:24.463 --> 36:27.415
And then they'll do another test,
just ten times more powerful.

36:27.466 --> 36:29.167
But didn't Moscow say
to stick to the plan?

36:29.218 --> 36:30.919
Didn't you say that nothing changes?

36:30.970 --> 36:32.921
I'm changing... I'm changing the plan.

36:32.923 --> 36:34.973
Oh, you... you can do that?

36:35.007 --> 36:36.758
Those men out there at Trinity,

36:36.760 --> 36:40.595
they're not gonna stop
unless we stop them.

36:40.646 --> 36:42.981
Stop them how?

36:43.015 --> 36:44.482
You built the circuits,

36:44.517 --> 36:48.353
you can wire them to go
off at any time you like.

36:50.406 --> 36:53.691
You mean before everyone evacuates?

36:55.327 --> 36:57.162
Jim...

36:57.196 --> 37:00.165
You wanna kill the scientists?

37:00.199 --> 37:02.367
You wanna kill my friends?

37:04.203 --> 37:07.622
We do one terrible thing tomorrow,

37:07.624 --> 37:11.760
but then no one ever has to again.

37:21.470 --> 37:24.022
I wanna go to the test.

37:24.056 --> 37:28.693
And I'm gonna get there if I have
to stow away in somebody's trunk.

37:28.727 --> 37:30.195
Don't do that.

37:30.229 --> 37:31.613
Why not?

37:33.065 --> 37:35.033
Don't go to Trinity.

37:35.067 --> 37:37.035
You've got a lot of work to do here.

37:37.069 --> 37:38.319
Yeah, well, tell that to my boss.

37:38.321 --> 37:41.456
Even hogarth worked longer hours.

37:42.875 --> 37:46.828
Hey, Frank is damn lucky

37:46.830 --> 37:48.496
to have you as his deputy.

37:48.547 --> 37:50.915
And he's not going to
the Trinity site, either.

37:50.966 --> 37:53.251
No. But who is?

37:54.837 --> 37:58.890
You. A guy who went to
a second-rate law school

37:58.924 --> 38:00.892
is getting orchestra seats

38:00.926 --> 38:03.561
to physics history.

38:03.596 --> 38:06.848
Hey, I went to a third-rate law school.

38:06.899 --> 38:08.433
And if I could bring a date...

38:08.484 --> 38:11.186
Well, it wouldn't be me, apparently.

38:41.300 --> 38:42.600
Charlie Isaacs.

38:43.969 --> 38:46.604
What am I supposed
to call you? "Beuker"?

38:46.639 --> 38:48.389
Sure, why not?

38:50.526 --> 38:52.477
What the hell are you doing here?

38:52.528 --> 38:54.312
Uh, ever been to Brooklyn?

38:56.315 --> 38:58.483
Not in a long time. Why?

38:58.534 --> 39:01.119
Never mind. I heard
you fixed both gadgets

39:01.153 --> 39:03.121
inside of six months.

39:03.155 --> 39:05.240
Not bad for a conscientious objector.

39:05.242 --> 39:07.492
Yeah, maybe I went
to the wrong meetings.

39:07.543 --> 39:11.329
What do you want, Joe?

39:11.380 --> 39:14.799
You ever hear of camp
Aliceville in Alabama?

39:14.833 --> 39:17.302
Why? Is that where you're putting on

39:17.336 --> 39:19.337
your latest piece of theater?

39:19.388 --> 39:21.256
It's a prison for German pows.

39:21.307 --> 39:24.592
Not all military.
Cultural ambassadors, too.

39:24.643 --> 39:28.012
Even a few musicians.

39:28.063 --> 39:29.514
Including your mother.

39:32.151 --> 39:34.519
I thought you might like to know.

40:01.877 --> 40:04.845
Team leader from test vector x-2b,

40:04.880 --> 40:07.048
report to director Schaefer.

40:37.629 --> 40:40.047
Helen? What time is it?

40:40.082 --> 40:41.999
Business hours in New York.

40:42.050 --> 40:43.551
- Oh.
- Took some calls,

40:43.585 --> 40:45.419
but I got to the bottom of
how our metallurgy budget

40:45.470 --> 40:46.837
wound up in Rochester.

40:46.888 --> 40:48.556
Mm.

40:48.590 --> 40:50.725
Admin must've given you
the wrong form to sign,

40:50.759 --> 40:53.678
but, uh, you can give them
a call, straighten it out.

40:55.514 --> 40:58.683
Just leave the number here on my desk.

40:58.734 --> 41:02.069
The funny thing is... and you
won't believe the coincidence...

41:05.741 --> 41:09.894
Our money just funded all the
resources and equipment she needs.

41:09.928 --> 41:12.697
Small world.

41:12.699 --> 41:17.168
Must be really exhausting making sure
we don't finish little boy on time.

41:19.087 --> 41:20.755
As soon as you're sitting
in this chair again,

41:20.789 --> 41:22.373
we'll do things your way.

41:22.424 --> 41:24.292
I did everything you asked

41:24.343 --> 41:25.710
when you were running implosion.

41:25.712 --> 41:26.961
Even when it was illegal.

41:27.012 --> 41:29.880
I sounded the alarm
when you disappeared.

41:29.931 --> 41:32.633
Then I gave up my one shot at history

41:32.684 --> 41:34.101
so you could get us
a seat at the table...

41:34.136 --> 41:36.053
Scientific control of the bomb.

41:36.104 --> 41:37.605
But you don't want a
seat at the table, Frank.

41:37.639 --> 41:39.890
You don't want there
to be a table or a bomb.

41:39.941 --> 41:41.142
And you think that you're entitled

41:41.193 --> 41:42.727
to make that decision on your own.

41:42.778 --> 41:44.945
And what about you, Helen?

41:44.980 --> 41:48.282
You excited to incinerate 20,000 kids?

41:50.786 --> 41:52.953
How did you get this office back, Frank?

41:54.156 --> 41:56.324
Fixing Charlie's mistake?

41:56.375 --> 41:58.626
The detonator charges at the dry run,

41:58.660 --> 42:00.578
they got reversed somehow?

42:00.580 --> 42:02.380
You came to the rescue?

42:04.499 --> 42:06.250
Get the hell out of my office.

42:32.861 --> 42:34.412
Hey! What the hell?

42:36.415 --> 42:37.615
What are you doing?

42:49.211 --> 42:51.595
Excuse me, gentlemen. Thank you.

42:55.217 --> 42:58.386
Gentlemen? I think we have a quorum.

42:58.437 --> 43:01.188
I'll give the table
over to Dr. Oppenheimer.

43:03.225 --> 43:05.192
Thank you, Mr. secretary.

43:05.227 --> 43:07.528
The last time this committee met,

43:07.562 --> 43:09.196
it was on Pennsylvania Avenue.

43:09.231 --> 43:12.233
I think you'll find the
desert more civilized.

43:12.284 --> 43:13.284
I'll start.

43:18.874 --> 43:21.659
When I, uh, took this job...

43:23.378 --> 43:26.580
When I took this job, I had no idea

43:26.631 --> 43:28.165
what we were building here.

43:28.167 --> 43:32.386
When I found out, I wanted to leave.

43:32.421 --> 43:35.389
Since I've been here,
I've done things...

43:35.424 --> 43:38.342
I never imagined I was capable of.

43:38.344 --> 43:40.678
I convinced myself we
were here to protect

43:40.729 --> 43:43.180
our kids from the gestapo.

43:43.182 --> 43:47.067
Well, my wife...

43:47.102 --> 43:52.189
Sent my kid back east last night

43:52.191 --> 43:54.525
to protect him from me.

43:54.576 --> 43:55.943
Dr. Isaacs...

43:55.994 --> 43:58.863
She told me I'm a monster.

43:58.914 --> 44:01.282
A murderer.

44:01.333 --> 44:04.452
I wanted to tell her she was wrong,

44:04.503 --> 44:06.203
but I couldn't.

44:06.254 --> 44:07.755
I had a speech prepared.

44:07.789 --> 44:09.590
I was gonna come in here and tell you

44:09.624 --> 44:11.709
to detonate the bomb
on a desert island...

44:11.760 --> 44:15.212
A demonstration for the
Japanese high command.

44:15.263 --> 44:16.597
I was gonna tell you that hirohito

44:16.631 --> 44:18.432
would surrender on the spot.

44:18.467 --> 44:22.052
I was gonna say let's show restraint

44:22.103 --> 44:24.305
and we can be feared and loved

44:24.356 --> 44:26.724
and then be forgiven
for bringing the gadget

44:26.775 --> 44:29.226
into the world in the first place.

44:29.277 --> 44:32.446
But the truth is...

44:32.481 --> 44:34.315
We can be loved...

44:37.285 --> 44:40.070
Or we can have peace.

44:40.121 --> 44:41.739
Not both.

44:41.741 --> 44:44.909
So, if we want to change the world...

44:44.960 --> 44:47.745
And we do, gentlemen... we have to.

44:47.796 --> 44:51.415
If we want to change the world,

44:51.417 --> 44:54.134
then we need to embrace

44:54.169 --> 44:56.253
what the world will call us

44:56.304 --> 44:59.507
when we finish what we've started.

45:01.760 --> 45:06.514
Monsters...

45:06.565 --> 45:09.517
Who erased a city...

45:09.568 --> 45:10.818
Without warning.

45:10.852 --> 45:12.520
You mean a military target?

45:12.571 --> 45:14.822
No, a city full of civilians.

45:16.825 --> 45:19.326
And we detonate the altitude

45:19.361 --> 45:22.780
that gives us the widest blast radius.

45:22.782 --> 45:25.199
Maximum destruction of infrastructure.

45:25.250 --> 45:29.169
Homes, hospitals, schools.

45:29.204 --> 45:32.172
It has to be catastrophic...

45:32.207 --> 45:36.093
On a scale that no
one has ever imagined.

45:44.936 --> 45:47.354
If we detonate our
bomb on a desert island,

45:47.389 --> 45:48.973
we might stop this war.

45:49.024 --> 45:51.358
But we won't prevent the next one.

45:51.393 --> 45:53.978
The weapon we're testing...

45:54.029 --> 45:56.146
Fat man?

45:56.148 --> 45:57.815
It's nothing.

45:57.866 --> 46:00.568
We'll measure it in,
uh, kilotons of tnt.

46:00.619 --> 46:03.487
Twenty years from now
they'll be counting megatons,

46:03.538 --> 46:07.708
countries, continents.

46:07.742 --> 46:09.376
So I'm begging you,

46:09.411 --> 46:11.395
for your kids, your grand kids,

46:11.429 --> 46:14.548
show the world what
evil looks like once.

46:14.583 --> 46:16.000
See it through.

46:16.051 --> 46:18.235
As a species, we lack in imagination.

46:18.270 --> 46:20.838
We can't conceive of
the big nightmares...

46:20.840 --> 46:23.173
Genocide, mass starvation,

46:23.175 --> 46:28.012
or atomic war until we live it.

46:28.063 --> 46:30.431
We have to drop our bomb

46:30.482 --> 46:32.816
on a city in the heart of Japan.

46:34.519 --> 46:38.105
Because people need
something to be afraid of.

46:40.992 --> 46:44.612
Fear is now and has always been

46:44.663 --> 46:47.197
the only thing that keeps the peace.

46:47.248 --> 46:52.620
The only thing that changes the world,

46:52.671 --> 46:54.788
changes anything, anyone.

46:56.458 --> 46:58.626
We have to be monsters today

46:58.677 --> 47:01.178
to stop the monsters of tomorrow.

47:21.700 --> 47:23.033
Hi.

47:24.536 --> 47:25.819
Shouldn't you be in the desert

47:25.870 --> 47:27.655
with the rest of the nabobs

47:27.706 --> 47:29.707
doing the chain-reaction Charleston?

47:31.493 --> 47:33.994
I'm not really in a dancing mood.

47:40.301 --> 47:42.419
I just don't believe it, you know?

47:44.055 --> 47:45.923
That accidents just happen?

47:51.730 --> 47:53.263
Do you know what she
said to me that day?

47:53.314 --> 47:55.265
Jeannie?

47:55.316 --> 47:57.685
Whatever you're gonna say...

47:57.736 --> 47:59.153
Whether it's to make me feel better

47:59.187 --> 48:03.824
or just to spin some Crosley malarkey...

48:03.858 --> 48:05.442
Skip it.

48:10.248 --> 48:14.168
She said she didn't know what
we were doing in the tech area,

48:14.202 --> 48:17.538
but she knew that it
might change the world.

48:17.589 --> 48:20.174
And Jeannie said if
the world had to change,

48:20.208 --> 48:22.792
then you were the kind of
man to keep us all honest,

48:24.227 --> 48:26.728
