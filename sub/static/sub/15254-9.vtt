00:00.007 --> 00:01.628
<i>Hi, I'm Chuck.</i>
<i>Here are a few things that</i>

00:01.653 --> 00:02.348
<i>you might need to know.</i>

00:02.349 --> 00:05.425
Come on. Carmichael Industries.
The independence and freedom

00:05.426 --> 00:06.960
to do what we want when we want.

00:06.994 --> 00:07.994
I had no idea I had

00:08.028 --> 00:09.062
<i>such strong feelings for him.</i>

00:09.096 --> 00:10.163
I have to disappear for a while.

00:10.198 --> 00:11.898
All members of
Carmichael Industries

00:11.933 --> 00:15.168
have a position
open to them at the CIA.

00:15.203 --> 00:17.637
If we go back, it's just
gonna be missions and secrets.

00:17.672 --> 00:18.738
I don't want to go back.

00:18.773 --> 00:19.639
Okay.

00:19.674 --> 00:21.508
All we need is each other.

00:23.000 --> 00:29.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

00:33.654 --> 00:35.355
So, Mr. Carmichael,

00:35.389 --> 00:38.358
tell me,

00:38.392 --> 00:40.927
how do you feel like
dying today?

00:42.964 --> 00:44.531
Honestly?
You're gonna make me decide?

00:44.565 --> 00:47.667
I find it says
a lot about a man.

00:47.702 --> 00:48.735
I-I, you know, I don't know.

00:48.753 --> 00:49.769
Can't you just pick something?

00:49.804 --> 00:51.338
I've got a lot
on my plate right now.

00:51.372 --> 00:52.739
Like what?

00:52.757 --> 00:54.374
Running your
own company.

00:54.408 --> 00:56.443
It's just, you know, there's
a lot of responsibility

00:56.477 --> 00:58.278
that comes with that.

00:58.312 --> 01:00.847
Not that I don't care
about recovering

01:00.881 --> 01:02.915
spent nuclear fuel
rods, 'cause I do,

01:02.934 --> 01:04.918
but you got to keep your
eye the bottom line.

01:04.952 --> 01:07.604
And with missions, the
bottom line is cash, man.

01:07.638 --> 01:09.222
You know,
with all these

01:09.256 --> 01:10.991
private security firms
out there,

01:11.025 --> 01:13.944
I-I think maybe I'm coming
at this the wrong way.

01:13.978 --> 01:16.129
Maybe Carmichael Industries
needs a new hook, you know?

01:16.163 --> 01:17.731
Almost there, Chuck.

01:17.765 --> 01:19.633
You're very good at talking.

01:19.667 --> 01:21.401
Exactly.

01:21.435 --> 01:22.902
Any spy can sneak
into a building

01:22.937 --> 01:24.904
and-and snap
a few necks.

01:24.939 --> 01:27.107
But what are we doing right
here, right now, the two of us?

01:27.141 --> 01:29.109
We're talking about our
hopes and our dreams.

01:29.143 --> 01:32.078
So you're spies that care?

01:34.115 --> 01:35.448
You're a genius.

01:35.483 --> 01:36.683
That's inspired.
I'm gonna use that.

01:36.717 --> 01:37.717
Can I use that?

01:41.973 --> 01:43.556
I'm glad I could help you,
Mr. Carmichael,

01:43.591 --> 01:47.093
but I think I'll start
by cutting out your tongue.

01:47.128 --> 01:48.595
That would be a horrible idea.

01:49.981 --> 01:51.398
I would not want to do that.

01:51.432 --> 01:52.632
Especially with
such a blunt object.

01:52.650 --> 01:54.317
Stop it, baldy!

01:54.352 --> 01:55.902
Oh, my God.

01:55.936 --> 01:57.237
Chuck, are you okay?

01:57.271 --> 01:59.773
I think we just had
a breakthrough, honey.

01:59.807 --> 02:01.941
Do you think it's
okay to touch that

02:01.975 --> 02:02.942
without a radiation suit?

02:02.977 --> 02:04.944
Shouldn't be any worse

02:04.979 --> 02:06.446
than a couple
dozen X-rays.

02:06.480 --> 02:08.330
We'll be fine,
as long as no one's pregnant.

02:09.667 --> 02:10.917
Okay, Casey,

02:10.951 --> 02:12.752
I'm gonna let you take that.
Let's go.

02:23.464 --> 02:25.832
Don't tell me you're
getting sentimental.

02:27.735 --> 02:30.804
"Welcome back, Gertrude.

02:30.838 --> 02:32.339
"Good to see you, Gertrude.

02:32.373 --> 02:34.607
I missed you,
Gertrude."

02:34.642 --> 02:37.877
Just nod your head if you agree
with any of this.

02:37.912 --> 02:40.213
Didn't hear you come in.

02:40.247 --> 02:43.183
That's because
I took off my heels.

02:43.217 --> 02:45.785
Among other things.

02:45.820 --> 02:49.155
I guess you heard you're not
wanted for murder anymore.

02:49.190 --> 02:51.358
Beckman put a lid
on that whole Decker thing.

02:51.392 --> 02:53.059
Turns out, he was just
a patsy, just...

02:58.866 --> 03:02.836
I didn't fly halfway across
the world to be debriefed.

03:02.870 --> 03:03.837
Uh-uh.

03:03.871 --> 03:05.538
That's your job, John.

03:05.573 --> 03:07.707
Mm...

03:27.528 --> 03:29.562
I thought you said
you were coming to bed.

03:29.597 --> 03:33.333
Have you been
up all night long?

03:33.367 --> 03:34.901
That bad guy
got me thinking.

03:34.919 --> 03:37.070
The one who tried
to cut your tongue out?

03:37.104 --> 03:38.905
Our mission statement,
our mission statement.

03:38.923 --> 03:41.541
We spend so much time
focusing on spy missions,

03:41.575 --> 03:43.910
that we've lost sight of
the-the, you know, uh,

03:43.944 --> 03:45.945
"what are we doing,
why are we here" mission.

03:45.980 --> 03:47.213
Are you feeling okay?

03:47.247 --> 03:49.315
I think that pizza
that Morgan left in the fridge

03:49.350 --> 03:50.450
is starting to turn.

03:50.484 --> 03:52.352
I have never thought
more clearly in my life.

03:52.386 --> 03:56.556
Oh, "the things we feel
but do not share."

03:56.590 --> 03:58.558
What can we, Carmichael
Industries, offer our clients

03:58.592 --> 04:00.527
that other
security firms can't? Go.

04:00.561 --> 04:02.896
Discount electronics?

04:02.930 --> 04:04.063
We care, Sarah.

04:04.098 --> 04:05.598
We care.

04:05.633 --> 04:07.200
C-A-R-E.

04:07.234 --> 04:08.451
Clandestine Agents

04:08.486 --> 04:10.203
Relating Emotionally.

04:10.237 --> 04:11.404
Get it?

04:11.439 --> 04:12.822
You hate it.

04:12.873 --> 04:15.475
No, I think
it's very interesting.

04:15.509 --> 04:18.611
I just, uh, I just feel
very queasy suddenly.

04:18.629 --> 04:20.279
Huh.

04:20.314 --> 04:22.315
Maybe the pizza <i>was</i> bad.

04:29.924 --> 04:32.058
Who told you
you could get dressed?

04:33.093 --> 04:35.094
It's a work day, remember?

04:36.831 --> 04:39.265
First of all,
I have something for you.

04:39.299 --> 04:40.433
Hmm?

04:42.136 --> 04:43.503
Open it.

04:47.358 --> 04:49.325
It's a... sweater.

04:49.360 --> 04:51.110
Why's it so soft?

04:51.144 --> 04:53.146
It's cashmere.

04:53.180 --> 04:54.781
Doesn't feel
flame-retardant.

04:54.815 --> 04:59.335
It's the perfect weight for
a winter night in South Beach.

04:59.370 --> 05:01.321
What's in South Beach?

05:01.355 --> 05:03.456
The second part
of your surprise.

05:03.491 --> 05:06.342
You and I are going to Miami

05:06.377 --> 05:09.429
for three nights at the Maya.

05:11.298 --> 05:13.166
In the middle of the week?

05:13.200 --> 05:15.969
I can't just take off
and sun my buns in Miami.

05:16.003 --> 05:17.370
No, no, no.

05:17.404 --> 05:18.438
I have a job.

05:18.472 --> 05:19.606
Two, technically.

05:19.640 --> 05:21.207
Right, right.

05:21.242 --> 05:22.709
I get it.

05:22.743 --> 05:23.943
I'll, uh, call you later.

05:23.978 --> 05:24.944
Okay.

05:24.979 --> 05:26.646
- Good.
- Hey.

05:26.680 --> 05:28.481
Don't forget your new sweater.

05:35.756 --> 05:37.290
Why are we looking at
surveillance footage

05:37.324 --> 05:39.025
from this morning?

05:39.043 --> 05:41.160
I don't know... yet.

05:41.194 --> 05:43.379
Ever since I got
my brain cleaned,

05:43.414 --> 05:45.832
I've had this suspicion
that something's happening

05:45.866 --> 05:47.199
behind the scenes here.

05:47.218 --> 05:49.168
Wait a minute.

05:49.202 --> 05:50.470
Is that...?

05:50.504 --> 05:51.471
Bingo.

05:51.505 --> 05:53.072
John Casey wearing

05:53.107 --> 05:55.041
a deep V-neck
cashmere sweater.

05:55.075 --> 05:57.393
Who are you,
John Casey?

05:57.428 --> 05:59.896
And what's he doing sneaking
around the Buy More hours

05:59.930 --> 06:01.347
before his shift starts?

06:01.381 --> 06:03.900
Maybe he's here
to meet somebody.

06:05.903 --> 06:07.553
Those two.

06:07.571 --> 06:09.355
Of course
they're in on it.

06:09.389 --> 06:11.224
In on what?
They're probably just doing it

06:11.258 --> 06:13.126
in the home theater room
like I do.

06:13.160 --> 06:14.410
Not likely.

06:14.445 --> 06:17.247
I'm gonna need some
three-by-five cards, stat.

06:17.281 --> 06:18.731
Okay.

06:18.766 --> 06:20.266
Stat!

06:24.622 --> 06:26.005
Ooh!

06:26.040 --> 06:29.108
I got to say, I'm grooving
on that deep V, Casey.

06:31.762 --> 06:34.414
What do you got here?

06:34.448 --> 06:37.150
"Clandestine Agents
Relating Emotionally."

06:37.184 --> 06:38.651
CARE?

06:38.686 --> 06:39.819
Mm-hmm.

06:39.853 --> 06:41.521
You really think this is
what our clients want,

06:41.555 --> 06:43.256
private security firm
that holds their hands,

06:43.290 --> 06:45.291
builds their self-esteem,
tells them they're special?

06:45.326 --> 06:48.595
Isn't that what
everyone wants, Casey?

06:48.629 --> 06:50.163
And it's no coincidence
that we booked

06:50.197 --> 06:51.564
our first client in forever,

06:51.599 --> 06:54.067
hours after I put my CARE
statement on our Web site.

06:54.101 --> 06:55.068
We have a Web site?

06:55.102 --> 06:56.102
Who's the client?

06:57.655 --> 07:00.073
Hey.

07:00.107 --> 07:01.908
I told you I
was working.

07:01.942 --> 07:04.410
So am I.

07:04.444 --> 07:06.779
You're the cl--
She's the client?

07:06.797 --> 07:10.450
May I remind you that you have
your own personal security firm.

07:10.484 --> 07:14.220
My personnel are
stretched a bit thin.

07:14.254 --> 07:17.840
Besides, your company
offers a level of service

07:17.891 --> 07:20.593
that other companies
just don't offer.

07:20.627 --> 07:22.478
You care.

07:23.797 --> 07:27.100
And I intend to take
full advantage of that.

07:27.134 --> 07:30.136
See? Mission statement
working already.

becoming one of the biggest

08:23.460 --> 08:24.594

08:24.628 --> 08:26.262
that he insists on
conducting face-to-face.

08:27.297 --> 08:28.464
You'll act as protection.

Miami.

08:31.001 --> 08:32.668
Mm, what a coincidence.

08:32.703 --> 08:33.936
Is it okay

08:33.971 --> 08:36.272
if I make the retainer fee

08:36.306 --> 08:37.640
payable to

08:37.674 --> 08:39.609
Carmichael Industries?
Sure.

08:39.643 --> 08:42.611
Actually, I'm gonna pay
the whole fee right up front.

08:42.645 --> 08:43.946
We haven't said yes
to running...

08:43.981 --> 08:45.281
Yes.
Yes.

08:48.485 --> 08:51.387
Meet you on the runway
bright and early.

08:51.422 --> 08:55.324
That way, we can catch
some pool time.

08:55.359 --> 08:56.959
Sounds good.

08:56.994 --> 08:58.294
See you in the a.m.

08:58.328 --> 08:59.879
What is your problem?

08:59.930 --> 09:01.364
Yeah, seriously,
what is your problem?

09:01.398 --> 09:02.799
That was not
very caring, Casey.

09:02.833 --> 09:05.735
An above-board
arms deal in Miami?

09:05.769 --> 09:06.869
Sounds like a vacation.

09:06.904 --> 09:08.187
Haven't you had enough

09:08.222 --> 09:10.173
kidnapping, torture
and bloodshed?

09:10.207 --> 09:11.307
Besides, we haven't

09:11.341 --> 09:12.642
made a cent in months,

09:12.676 --> 09:14.243
and your girlfriend
has deep pockets.

09:14.278 --> 09:16.646
She's not my girlfriend.

09:16.680 --> 09:18.748
Whatever you want to call her,
she's our new client.

09:18.782 --> 09:20.650
Pack your bags, lover boy.

09:21.852 --> 09:23.719
We're going to South Beach.

09:26.056 --> 09:28.074
Are you going out of town?

09:28.125 --> 09:29.859
Yeah, something came up.

09:29.877 --> 09:31.694
I have to leave
for a couple days.

09:33.063 --> 09:35.298
Movie night.

09:35.332 --> 09:37.233
It's okay, we'll
do it next week.

09:37.267 --> 09:40.887
And don't worry, I
have already chosen

09:40.889 --> 09:42.605
what we'll watch.

09:42.639 --> 09:44.507
<i>"Downton Abbey.</i> worry, I
have already chosen

09:44.541 --> 09:48.511
An upstairs/downstairs costume
drama in early 1900s England."

09:48.545 --> 09:51.114
Yeah, something tells me,
not gonna be a lot of explosions

09:51.148 --> 09:52.682
in that one.
Are you kidding?

09:52.716 --> 09:54.884
What about the bombs they drop
on Edwardian convention?

09:57.054 --> 09:59.522
Uh, listen, I-I-- yeah.

09:59.556 --> 10:01.023
It's okay,
you don't have to explain.

10:02.726 --> 10:03.743
You're my hero.

10:07.731 --> 10:09.932
Please pardon the speculative
nature of my research.

10:09.967 --> 10:11.901
This is just the first stab

10:11.935 --> 10:14.570
at what I think
our coworkers are really up to.

10:14.588 --> 10:15.605
Okay.

10:17.574 --> 10:19.909
Obviously, some of my deductions
are quite tenuous,

10:19.927 --> 10:22.077
but if you'll bear with me
for just a moment...

10:22.095 --> 10:23.746
You think they're spies?

10:23.780 --> 10:25.414
Casey and Sarah?

10:25.432 --> 10:28.484
Yes. Probably NSA or CIA.

10:28.519 --> 10:29.986
Chuck is some kind of asset.

10:30.020 --> 10:31.137
The only thing left

10:31.188 --> 10:32.989
to figure out is this.

10:33.023 --> 10:34.123
There's a fourth
member of their team.

10:34.158 --> 10:35.424
He's their secret weapon.

10:42.299 --> 10:43.633
What are you guys doing?

10:43.667 --> 10:45.651
He's seen too much. Grab him!

10:54.828 --> 10:56.779
Guys! Guys, guys,
guys, guys.

11:01.134 --> 11:02.802
You see how he
slipped out like that?

11:02.836 --> 11:04.754
Maybe he's our
mystery agent.

11:06.557 --> 11:08.958
Wait, wait, easy.
Easy there, Jeffrey.

11:08.976 --> 11:11.427
I was with you on the whole
conspiracy theory thing,

11:11.461 --> 11:13.863
but seriously, this loser,
a spy?

11:13.897 --> 11:15.932
I mean, come on. Come on.
Yeah, I mean, come on.

11:15.966 --> 11:18.301
Either way, he's gonna tell
Chuck we're on to him.

11:18.335 --> 11:19.802
Fine. We'll kill him.

11:19.820 --> 11:22.939
What? No. Guys, I'm not gonna
tell Chuck squat, all right?

11:22.973 --> 11:24.307
I've been conducting
my own investigation,

11:24.341 --> 11:26.525
and you guys are
absolutely right.

11:26.577 --> 11:28.277
You nailed it,
all right?

11:28.312 --> 11:30.830
There <i>is</i> a mystery agent.
I've tracked him down.

11:30.864 --> 11:32.682
And, uh, I got him.

11:32.716 --> 11:33.749
You... are you, uh...
you're gonna...

11:33.784 --> 11:35.384
this is gonna
blow your mind.

11:35.419 --> 11:37.954
You're gonna be, like, "What?
There's no way he's, you know."

11:37.988 --> 11:40.656
But boom,
there he is, all right?

11:40.691 --> 11:42.091
If that's not James Bond,

11:42.125 --> 11:44.794
I don't know what is, right?
Of course.

11:44.828 --> 11:47.163
♪

12:04.448 --> 12:06.181
Hello, darling.

12:06.199 --> 12:11.153
Oh, garcon, another daiquiri
for me. And you?

12:11.187 --> 12:13.022
Just another sparkling water,
please.

12:13.040 --> 12:14.390
You heard the lady.

12:14.424 --> 12:16.058
And you can put that on
Ms. Verbanski's room.

12:16.093 --> 12:17.393
Thank you very much.

12:18.795 --> 12:22.632
Chuck, Sarah,
stay focused on the mission.

12:27.404 --> 12:29.672
Gertrude, you have a bogey
closing from your 9:00.

12:29.706 --> 12:32.041
Walker, you have
a positive I.D.?

12:33.877 --> 12:35.561
That's a negative on
Falcone, but there

12:35.595 --> 12:37.229
could be another
one of his heavies.

12:37.264 --> 12:38.681
Your call, Casey.

12:38.715 --> 12:40.182
I'll handle it.

12:42.419 --> 12:44.353
Package for Ms. Verbanski...

12:44.387 --> 12:45.021
Whoa!

12:46.773 --> 12:48.624
Thank you.

12:49.943 --> 12:51.060
A little jumpy, John?

12:51.078 --> 12:52.411
I thought he was one

12:52.446 --> 12:54.363
of Falcone's men.
Didn't know what he had.

12:54.397 --> 12:57.416
It's a little something that
I found for you in the lobby.

12:57.451 --> 12:59.785
What the hell is it?

12:59.836 --> 13:01.203
It's a swimsuit, John.

13:02.339 --> 13:05.908
Your job is to blend in
around here,

13:05.942 --> 13:08.210
and I'd like you
to put it on, please.

13:09.596 --> 13:12.415
Change room right there.

13:14.134 --> 13:15.751
Oh, God.

13:18.288 --> 13:20.973
You know, look,
I mean, honestly, Falcone

13:21.024 --> 13:22.725
is not gonna be showing
his face down here.

13:22.759 --> 13:24.060
You wanna go take a little dip

13:24.094 --> 13:25.428
in the hot tub
with me?

13:25.462 --> 13:27.396
No. No, I don't think
that's a good idea.

13:27.430 --> 13:30.399
No booze, no Jacuzz,
what's gotten into my wife?

13:30.434 --> 13:33.502
Look, why don't you just stay
put and take care of the client?

13:33.537 --> 13:36.072
I'm gonna go
check on Casey, okay?

13:36.106 --> 13:37.106
Casey.

13:37.124 --> 13:40.076
Just a minute!

13:40.110 --> 13:42.795
Oh, God,
I'm coming in.

13:42.829 --> 13:44.313
I can't do it, Walker.

13:44.348 --> 13:45.915
Sometimes Gertrude,

13:45.949 --> 13:48.351
she doesn't even listen
to what I'm trying to tell her.

13:48.385 --> 13:50.803
I can sympathize.

13:50.837 --> 13:52.254
Thank you.

13:52.289 --> 13:53.656
But you're putting on
that bathing suit.

13:53.690 --> 13:54.623
Like hell.

13:54.641 --> 13:55.791
This is a dream mission, Casey,

13:55.826 --> 13:57.560
and I'm not gonna
let you screw it up.

13:57.594 --> 13:58.694
Do you how many skimpy outfits

13:58.729 --> 14:00.096
I have had to put on
for this team?

14:00.130 --> 14:03.799
Did you hear me complain when
I had to put on a cat suit

14:03.817 --> 14:04.967
or seven-inch
platform high heels

14:05.001 --> 14:06.302
or a belly dancing outfit?

14:06.336 --> 14:08.671
Belly dancing?

14:08.705 --> 14:10.022
Okay, that was private.

14:10.073 --> 14:12.508
Look, just put on the banana
hammock and stop whining.

14:14.177 --> 14:15.378
You okay, Walker?

14:15.412 --> 14:16.846
You seem a little emotional
these days.

14:16.880 --> 14:18.748
Shut up.

14:29.559 --> 14:30.826
Guys, I lost Verbanski.

14:30.844 --> 14:32.495
What? What do you mean,
you lost Verbanski?

14:32.529 --> 14:34.496
Falcone musta scoped
our Mickey Mouse security.

14:34.514 --> 14:36.549
Verbanski? Verbanski?

14:36.600 --> 14:38.184
She's not responding
on comms.

14:38.218 --> 14:40.035
Her signal is still
transmitting.

14:40.070 --> 14:42.171
I'm showing her at the far
west corner of the hotel.

14:42.205 --> 14:45.691
Casey, I need your help!

14:45.725 --> 14:47.143
We're coming in.

14:47.177 --> 14:48.677
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

14:50.397 --> 14:53.482
Falcone must be holding her in
the Presidential Suite.

15:06.029 --> 15:07.129
Where's Falcone?

15:07.164 --> 15:08.831
We're meeting him for dinner,
John.

15:08.865 --> 15:13.085
In the meantime, I suggest
we work up an appetite.

15:13.136 --> 15:15.538
I'll show you what's
under mine

15:15.572 --> 15:19.141
if you show me
what's under yours.

15:36.693 --> 15:38.777
You've been a naughty,
naughty colonel.

15:43.917 --> 15:46.168
What is it?

15:46.203 --> 15:48.437
Sarah, what's wrong?

15:48.472 --> 15:50.756
Everything.

15:50.790 --> 15:52.241
It's all wrong.

16:12.678 --> 16:15.158
Well, very smart, Ms. Verbanski:

16:15.159 --> 16:19.096
meeting in public,
bringing your own security team.

16:19.130 --> 16:22.949
It's like you don't trust me.

16:25.236 --> 16:26.736
Easy, Casey.

16:32.677 --> 16:35.796
This is my price.

16:35.830 --> 16:36.963
And this is mine...

16:36.998 --> 16:39.883
provided the merchandise
meets my specs.

16:43.337 --> 16:45.839
Some woman, your boss.

16:47.125 --> 16:49.810
I have a private weapons range.

16:49.844 --> 16:52.662
Meet me there
at midnight.

16:52.697 --> 16:54.598
And don't forget your checkbook.

16:58.703 --> 17:02.272
Are you seriously considering
going to an unsecured location?

17:03.508 --> 17:06.376
John, I want those guns.

17:06.410 --> 17:08.444
And when I want something...

17:15.086 --> 17:18.622
Any...  Anyhoo,
I'd like to, uh,

17:18.656 --> 17:21.208
on behalf of our team,

17:21.259 --> 17:22.626
propose a toast
to you

17:22.660 --> 17:25.662
because honestly, kudos.
I like how you do business.

17:25.695 --> 17:26.663
Know what I mean?

17:26.696 --> 17:29.199
This op is top-shelf.

17:29.233 --> 17:31.801
Well, you know, at Verbanski
Corp we have a work hard,

17:31.836 --> 17:33.837
play hard philosophy.

17:33.871 --> 17:37.006
Here's to playing harder.

17:39.110 --> 17:41.844
Excuse me.
I'll be at the bar.

17:43.314 --> 17:47.067
Don't worry.
I got this. I got this.

17:47.118 --> 17:48.752
Put it on your tab,
Mr. Verbanski?

17:53.457 --> 17:55.041
Mind if I give you
a little advice?

17:55.076 --> 17:56.459
If you use the word "care,"

17:56.494 --> 17:58.461
I'm gonna take this glass,
shove it down your throat

17:58.496 --> 18:00.730
and punch you in the stomach
so it shatters, hmm?

18:00.765 --> 18:04.050
Okay. It's not spy advice.

18:04.085 --> 18:05.535
It's actually relationship
advice.

18:05.570 --> 18:08.255
She doesn't want
a relationship.

18:08.306 --> 18:11.741
She wants a lackey, a lapdog,
a beefcake.

18:11.776 --> 18:14.227
What is Verbanski really trying
to tell you,

18:14.262 --> 18:15.878
John, huh?

18:15.897 --> 18:18.682
Because even tough women like
Gertrude and Sarah,

18:18.716 --> 18:20.183
they're constantly giving out
these secret signals

18:20.217 --> 18:22.018
that you need
to be sensitive to.

18:22.053 --> 18:24.020
I know we spend
so much time sharpening

18:24.055 --> 18:27.390
our spy senses that we forget to
use this, this guy, the heart.

18:27.425 --> 18:28.725
You know what I'm
talking about.

18:28.759 --> 18:32.262
And you need to learn how
to listen with your heart.

18:34.799 --> 18:36.600
Come on.
I'll show you how it's done.

18:41.789 --> 18:43.072
Are you all ready to order?

18:43.090 --> 18:47.093
Oh, uh, I think I might need
a couple extra minutes.

18:47.128 --> 18:50.747
Mmm, you just
kind of...

18:50.765 --> 18:53.883
gonna have to listen to her,
listen to her, okay?

18:53.918 --> 18:56.453
I know what she wants before
she knows what she wants.

18:56.487 --> 18:57.754
Observe.

18:57.788 --> 18:59.623
Actually, I'd love
to order for my lady.

19:00.625 --> 19:02.092
If you don't mind, hon.

19:02.126 --> 19:04.093
I think to wet her whistle,

19:04.111 --> 19:06.730
she'll start with
a glass of your Barolo.

19:06.764 --> 19:09.065
I'm so wrong.
We're on vacation.

19:09.100 --> 19:10.784
Vodka martini up.

19:10.818 --> 19:12.319
Thank you very much.

19:12.370 --> 19:13.803
Entree: bone-in rib eye

19:13.838 --> 19:17.674
extra rare, I'm talking blue
or as blue as you can find.

19:17.708 --> 19:21.244
as in mooing on
the plate.

19:21.278 --> 19:25.281
That's bad-- I don't
do a good cow.

19:26.917 --> 19:28.084
She's like a book,

19:28.119 --> 19:30.337
and I'm an emotional
speed-reader, my friend.

19:33.691 --> 19:35.458
What's going on, bro?

19:35.493 --> 19:37.427
Devon, you have
been targeted.

19:37.461 --> 19:39.062
Targeted?
What? Who?

19:39.096 --> 19:40.530
Jeff and Lester.

19:40.564 --> 19:43.099
They think that you're some sort
of international super spy.

19:43.134 --> 19:45.669
Those idiots? Why?

19:45.703 --> 19:47.304
Because I told 'em.

19:47.338 --> 19:50.040
Maybe it's because Jeff is no
longer an idiot, I don't know.

19:50.074 --> 19:52.509
But those two stumbled upon our
actual spy operation.

19:52.543 --> 19:53.843
You see?

19:53.878 --> 19:56.029
Gotcha. You need me
to throw 'em off the scent.

19:56.080 --> 19:59.416
Hey... now you're
thinking like a spy.

19:59.450 --> 20:01.001
Here's the key question:

20:01.035 --> 20:02.319
Can you act like one?

20:02.353 --> 20:04.487
Can I go formal?

20:12.496 --> 20:14.731
I've secured the U-238.

20:14.765 --> 20:16.733
This device
will make you

20:16.767 --> 20:18.635
more powerful
than you ever dreamed.

20:18.669 --> 20:20.186
Location forthcoming.

20:27.010 --> 20:28.244
Wait, wait, wait.

20:29.530 --> 20:31.648
Are you sure you don't want us
to do a little recon

20:31.682 --> 20:34.117
before it's too late?

20:34.151 --> 20:35.785
It's not my
first arms deal.

20:42.626 --> 20:44.210
I'm good for my half.

20:45.579 --> 20:47.714
And you?

20:50.084 --> 20:51.501
Ms. Verbanski,

20:51.535 --> 20:54.904
do you always dress your
security this well?

20:57.475 --> 20:59.092
Looks soft.

20:59.143 --> 21:01.211
Just show us the guns, huh?

21:02.747 --> 21:04.013
Yeah.

21:08.769 --> 21:10.153
I present to you...

21:10.187 --> 21:11.187
the Aegis.

21:11.221 --> 21:13.573
Please, have a try.

21:22.249 --> 21:25.234
Casey, don't we need
ear protection or something?

21:29.340 --> 21:31.641
Huh, not bad.

21:31.675 --> 21:33.042
Not bad.

21:33.076 --> 21:37.547
Verbanski Corp will take
full delivery.

21:37.581 --> 21:39.048
Three million dollars.

21:41.185 --> 21:43.119
No deal.

21:45.623 --> 21:48.992
Actually, I'll take your money.

21:52.480 --> 21:54.364
But you can leave me your guns.

22:05.376 --> 22:08.678
Casey, why aren't they dead?

22:08.712 --> 22:10.330
What your boss
didn't tell you,

22:10.381 --> 22:12.282
is that the Aegis has
a safety feature.

22:12.316 --> 22:16.052
Each gun can be coded so that it
can't be fired at someone

22:16.086 --> 22:17.620
carrying an Aegis with
the same code.

22:17.638 --> 22:19.355
It's a way of preventing

22:19.390 --> 22:20.890
friendly fire.

22:25.830 --> 22:27.697
Ingenious, no?

22:27.731 --> 22:29.849
Quite.

22:38.909 --> 22:43.580
Except my team's weapons
don't have that safety feature.

22:43.614 --> 22:46.533
And it would be a shame
if someone got shot.

22:48.619 --> 22:53.206
The price just changed, Rock.
How does free grab you?

22:55.709 --> 22:57.877
Okay, would someone like
to please explain to me

22:57.928 --> 22:59.379
what the heck
is going on?

22:59.430 --> 23:02.499
So this was your plan all along.
We were the loser team you hired

23:02.533 --> 23:04.067
so Rocky'd think
you were vulnerable.

23:04.101 --> 23:07.770
Nice.
No. I still need you, John.

23:07.805 --> 23:12.809
Rocky is just the first piece
of the puzzle.

23:12.843 --> 23:14.444
The real mission starts now.

23:15.446 --> 23:17.897
I'm out.

23:17.948 --> 23:20.016
Casey, wait.

23:25.122 --> 23:27.123
Whoa, hey... Whoa, whoa, whoa.

23:27.157 --> 23:28.825
Team meeting, team meeting.

23:28.859 --> 23:30.076
Casey, you can't
just walk away.

23:30.127 --> 23:32.128
If you quit now, we'll be
lucky to see the retainer.

23:32.162 --> 23:34.497
Besides, what did we talk about
at the restaurant, huh?

23:34.531 --> 23:36.049
What did we talk about?

23:36.083 --> 23:38.234
Are you using this?

23:38.269 --> 23:40.303
I think you owe it
to our client.

23:40.337 --> 23:42.605
Listen to her signals.
What is she really telling you?

23:42.640 --> 23:44.274
You think I need to be
more sensitive?

23:44.308 --> 23:47.043
More in tune with my
girlfriend's emotions, hmm?

23:47.077 --> 23:48.711
You're one to talk.

23:48.746 --> 23:50.046
What's that supposed to mean?

23:50.080 --> 23:52.148
It means you've got your head

23:52.182 --> 23:54.217
so far up your new
CARE manifesto

23:54.251 --> 23:56.319
you don't even realize your own
wife thinks she's pregnant

23:56.353 --> 23:58.071
and is hiding
it from you.

23:58.105 --> 23:59.756
What are you crazy?
There's no way...

23:59.790 --> 24:01.274
There's no way she could
be pregnant.

24:01.325 --> 24:02.859
I'd have to be the most
clueless,

24:02.893 --> 24:04.444
insensitive, uncaring...

24:04.495 --> 24:06.129
Uh, Chuck...

24:15.872 --> 24:19.091
Sarah, I'm sorry. I didn't
exactly pick up on your signals.

24:19.763 --> 24:22.798
No, I'm sorry. I should
have just told you.

24:22.833 --> 24:24.234
It just felt like if I said
it out loud, it would

24:24.259 --> 24:25.459
suddenly become real.

24:25.478 --> 24:27.546
It's changing, it's changing,
it's changing.

24:29.261 --> 24:32.130
What is that--
an equal sign, an arrow?

24:32.164 --> 24:36.301
A peace sign?
Is that an option?

24:37.303 --> 24:40.305
Um...

24:40.339 --> 24:44.843
Uh, okay, that means no.

24:44.877 --> 24:46.511
I'm not pregnant.

24:46.545 --> 24:49.147
Okay, all right.

24:49.181 --> 24:50.582
And you feel...?

24:50.616 --> 24:53.685
Strange.

24:53.719 --> 24:55.487
Maybe a little relieved.

24:55.521 --> 24:57.122
Same.

24:58.391 --> 24:59.624
Same.

24:59.659 --> 25:03.762
But this whole thing
has gotten me thinking

25:03.796 --> 25:06.431
about our lives, our future.
Chuck...

25:06.465 --> 25:08.400
I mean, honestly, Sarah,
is the spy lifestyle

25:08.434 --> 25:10.769
really where we want
to be raising our kids,

25:10.803 --> 25:12.437
you know, putting ourselves
in danger every day?

25:12.471 --> 25:14.072
Chuck...
Yeah?

25:14.090 --> 25:15.407
You're spiraling.

25:15.441 --> 25:17.442
Mm-hmm.

25:21.480 --> 25:23.214
I need you back in immediately.

25:23.249 --> 25:24.849
I was telling Casey the truth.

25:24.884 --> 25:25.950
I leveraged Rocky Falcone

25:25.985 --> 25:28.019
to give up his supplier.

25:28.054 --> 25:29.804
Pedro St. Germain is notorious.

25:29.855 --> 25:31.923
All guns and narcotics
that come up from the South

25:31.957 --> 25:34.759
flow through him.
He has an enormous FBI bounty

25:34.794 --> 25:36.494
on his head
if I'm not mistaken.

25:36.529 --> 25:38.296
And that's where
the real mission comes in.

25:38.330 --> 25:40.265
The FBI hired me
to find St. Germain.

25:40.299 --> 25:42.934
And Falcone kindly gave up his
exact location in the Everglades.

25:42.952 --> 25:46.538
We're in. We'll be in
Miami by nightfall.

25:46.572 --> 25:47.977
Actually, honey, I think
we should discuss this.

25:48.002 --> 25:49.202
Discuss what?

25:49.325 --> 25:51.142
I don't think it's safe
for prospective parents

25:51.177 --> 25:52.544
to be in a
situation like this.

25:52.578 --> 25:54.079
I've been toying with cutting
back on the grunt work.

25:54.113 --> 25:56.490
That's cute. I just figured
you'd want to finish the mission

25:56.491 --> 25:58.001
you started and take some of the
proceeds...

25:58.026 --> 25:59.183
<i>Un momento.</i> I was just saying

25:59.184 --> 26:01.085
maybe we should talk about...
And she hung up.

26:01.238 --> 26:04.374
Chuck, stop spiraling.

26:04.408 --> 26:08.211
I'm-I'm not spiraling.
You're spiraling.

26:17.354 --> 26:19.055
Ooh, yeah, cashmere, nice.

26:19.089 --> 26:21.441
Do you mind? I have a tailor who
can make me two sweaters

26:21.475 --> 26:22.492
out of this bad boy.

26:24.094 --> 26:25.762
Rough mission?

26:25.796 --> 26:27.063
I don't want to talk about it.

26:27.097 --> 26:29.899
Okay, that's no problem.
Tons to talk about.

26:29.933 --> 26:31.984
Lot of stuff going on
at the Buy More.

26:32.036 --> 26:35.104
Verbanski wasn't bringing
me a mission.

26:35.139 --> 26:37.106
It was an all-expenses-paid
vacation.

26:37.141 --> 26:39.809
Sun, sand, sex.

26:39.843 --> 26:41.778
The nerve
of that woman.

26:41.812 --> 26:43.913
I'm not a kept man.
I'm a spy, damn it.

26:43.947 --> 26:45.248
Don't I know it.

26:45.282 --> 26:46.999
Trust me.

26:47.051 --> 26:51.320
In fact, I might have a little
spy work for you.

26:51.355 --> 26:53.756
What kind of spy work
do you have?

26:53.791 --> 26:55.358
Hmm.

27:01.798 --> 27:03.966
I'm making the drop now.

27:05.769 --> 27:08.471
I have my eyes on the drop spot.

27:10.741 --> 27:12.475
Ten-four. Let's go.

27:20.317 --> 27:23.953
Okay. It's oddly
comfortable running in heels.

27:31.695 --> 27:33.880
Perfect. Come on.

27:33.931 --> 27:37.133
Just so you know,
I'm keeping these shoes.

27:37.167 --> 27:39.185
Calm down, Jeff.

28:03.360 --> 28:05.628
We strike from
the east entrance.

28:05.662 --> 28:07.530
Take St. Germain alive.

28:30.387 --> 28:32.822
Figured it was only
a matter of time

28:32.856 --> 28:35.224
before that rat Falcone
sold me out.

28:35.259 --> 28:38.561
You waving that gun around for
show or are you going to use it?

28:54.411 --> 28:58.281
Yeah? I take it
this is an apology.

28:58.315 --> 29:01.467
I got your girlfriend,
so you might want to listen up.

29:03.020 --> 29:06.189
You got her all tied up,
do you?

29:06.223 --> 29:09.859
Uh, yeah, yeah, she is.

29:09.893 --> 29:13.112
Uh-huh. And she needs
her big, strong boyfriend

29:13.146 --> 29:14.397
to come rescue her, right?

29:14.431 --> 29:17.200
Again, correct.

29:17.234 --> 29:19.802
And bring $10 million cash.

29:19.836 --> 29:23.072
That's a nice detail.

29:23.106 --> 29:25.575
Look, you tell Verbanski
she fooled me once--

29:25.609 --> 29:27.493
she's not going to fool
me again, got it?

29:27.544 --> 29:29.662
She said you'd
be playing hardball.

29:29.713 --> 29:31.747
Don't pay him anything, Casey!

29:31.782 --> 29:33.416
I can handle it myself!

29:33.450 --> 29:36.252
Didn't I tell you to shut up?!

29:36.286 --> 29:38.087
Gertrude? Gertrude?

29:38.121 --> 29:42.475
So $10 million by tonight

29:42.509 --> 29:44.960
or she dies.

29:53.925 --> 29:55.087
Okay.

29:55.651 --> 29:57.761
10 mil to go.

29:58.006 --> 30:00.107
Think they'll check to see
if it's counterfeit?

30:00.141 --> 30:03.277
Oh, I'm pretty sure they will.
If all goes according to plan,

30:03.311 --> 30:05.646
they're not going to be in any
condition to check anything.

30:05.680 --> 30:07.748
Undetectable
if the case is searched.

30:07.782 --> 30:10.751
Walker, when I say
the code word "CARE,"

30:10.785 --> 30:13.387
you start picking off the guards
so I can get to my weapon.

30:13.421 --> 30:15.039
And my job would be?

30:15.090 --> 30:16.490
You're getaway driver.

30:16.524 --> 30:18.425
Trust me, Chuck,
you don't want to have

30:18.460 --> 30:19.660
anything to do with this.

30:19.694 --> 30:21.295
It's going to be
a bloodbath in there.

30:21.329 --> 30:23.664
You just be ready for extraction
when the time comes.

30:23.698 --> 30:26.050
Okay, let's do it.
Oh, hey, Walker, listen.

30:26.101 --> 30:28.669
You sure you're not, uh...?

30:28.703 --> 30:30.554
I'm not pregnant.

30:30.605 --> 30:32.239
Okay.

30:32.273 --> 30:35.509
Because this is going to be dangerous...
I know.

30:35.543 --> 30:38.178
I get how dangerous
it is. Let's go.

30:50.075 --> 30:51.859
Stop.
I'm unarmed.

30:51.893 --> 30:54.211
I'm here for a trade
with St. Germain.

30:58.356 --> 30:59.860
There's a guy here who says
he wants to make a trade

30:59.885 --> 31:01.085
with St. Germain.

31:02.570 --> 31:04.088
Copy that.

31:22.407 --> 31:24.625
- What if we had a baby at home?
- Excuse me?

31:24.659 --> 31:27.695
What if we had a baby
relying on us to come home,

31:27.729 --> 31:29.196
and something happened?

31:29.230 --> 31:31.198
Something?
Something, anything.

31:31.232 --> 31:32.583
I don't know,
we didn't come home.

31:32.617 --> 31:34.234
Who would raise the kids?

31:34.252 --> 31:36.236
What-what would happen then?

31:36.254 --> 31:38.756
Honey, we don't have a baby,
let alone babies plural.

31:38.790 --> 31:41.275
Not now, but we will.

31:42.343 --> 31:44.044
Maybe you're right--

31:44.079 --> 31:46.013
spying and parenting
just don't go together.

31:46.047 --> 31:47.715
Sarah, you're spiraling, okay?

31:47.749 --> 31:48.840
Take a deep breath.

31:48.841 --> 31:50.477
Everything's going
to be fine, I promise.

31:50.516 --> 31:51.716
Okay.

31:51.920 --> 31:53.087
Are you sure?

31:53.121 --> 31:54.087
Yeah.

31:54.105 --> 31:56.724
We need to split up.

31:56.758 --> 32:00.360
Your knight in shining armor
has arrived.

32:19.347 --> 32:21.465
Let's see what you brought me.

32:23.384 --> 32:26.003
I'm almost to the compound,
Casey.

32:33.328 --> 32:35.262
Ah!

32:35.296 --> 32:36.430
Sarah! I'm coming!

32:43.738 --> 32:45.022
Ah...
Sarah, are you okay?

32:45.073 --> 32:46.690
Yeah. I'm fine,
I'm fine, I'm fine.

32:46.741 --> 32:49.209
It was just a flash grenade.
But I-I can't see.

32:49.244 --> 32:51.662
I could've handled this myself.

32:51.696 --> 32:54.281
I couldn't leave you
out here in the swamp.

32:57.669 --> 32:59.686
Because I care.

32:59.721 --> 33:01.369
Okay, that's Casey.
You've got to go.

33:01.394 --> 33:02.594
Are you crazy?
I'm not going to leave

33:02.857 --> 33:04.358
you here alone.
No. I'll be fine in a minute.

33:04.392 --> 33:08.045
Please, just take my gun in case
something goes wrong, okay?

33:08.096 --> 33:10.063
I'm not gonna need it,
I have the AEGIS.

33:10.098 --> 33:11.064
I love you.

33:11.099 --> 33:14.034
Be safe, okay?

33:14.068 --> 33:15.903
I said, I care.

33:17.939 --> 33:20.674
Ah, maybe I care too much.

33:26.214 --> 33:28.849
I've been working so hard
on my spy senses, too.

33:28.883 --> 33:30.250
My eyes,

33:30.285 --> 33:32.419
my ears,
my fists...

33:34.455 --> 33:36.356
What I should've
been working on is this.

33:36.391 --> 33:38.358
John, stop. Stop.

33:38.393 --> 33:39.693
Please stop.

33:39.727 --> 33:42.963
No, I can't, Gertrude...

33:42.997 --> 33:44.164
because I love you.

33:47.235 --> 33:50.204
And I need you to know
how much I care.

33:53.441 --> 33:55.709
I care a lot.

33:55.743 --> 33:57.744
I don't know who you're
trying to signal, man,

33:57.779 --> 33:59.413
but it all stops right now.

34:04.569 --> 34:06.270
Sorry I'm late.

34:11.275 --> 34:13.193
I've got the Aegis.
They can't hit us.

34:15.830 --> 34:17.781
We need to
get to cover!

34:17.831 --> 34:19.917
I am the cover!

34:19.951 --> 34:21.952
Move, move, move!
Ah, ah...

34:23.121 --> 34:24.905
Move!

34:24.938 --> 34:26.672
I heard your speech!

34:26.708 --> 34:28.942
It's great that you're opening
up your heart like that!

34:28.976 --> 34:30.377
Yeah.

34:36.516 --> 34:38.518
Move, move!

34:39.603 --> 34:40.587
Good show!

34:40.605 --> 34:42.606
Very entertaining.

34:45.025 --> 34:46.426
But shotguns don't have
safeties.

34:56.471 --> 34:58.972
Don't worry.
I wore my seatbelt.

35:17.824 --> 35:18.774
Hey.

35:18.808 --> 35:21.143
Hey.

35:21.194 --> 35:23.445
Everything all right?

35:23.479 --> 35:25.280
Yeah, I'm just
doing some thinking.

35:25.315 --> 35:26.481
Uh...

35:26.533 --> 35:28.066
I have a small
confession to make:

35:28.101 --> 35:31.904
part of me was kind of hoping
that I was pregnant.

35:37.477 --> 35:39.478
I've thought a lot
about that, too.

35:39.512 --> 35:42.814
And... yeah, I think
it'd be kind of exciting.

35:42.849 --> 35:45.951
I mean, it's not like I want
a baby right this second,

35:45.985 --> 35:48.420
but it's not the
worst idea in the world.

35:48.454 --> 35:50.589
No. No, it's not.

35:52.625 --> 35:54.660
Listen to us,
talking about kids,

35:54.694 --> 35:56.128
and a house, and a real family.

35:56.162 --> 35:58.647
Did you think we'd ever be
talking about stuff like this?

35:58.681 --> 35:59.998
Nope.

36:00.033 --> 36:01.767
Especially not with
such a huge nerd.

36:01.801 --> 36:03.302
Ah ha ha...

36:05.405 --> 36:07.406
♪

36:12.478 --> 36:13.946
Thought we were past this.

36:13.980 --> 36:15.781
Just open it.

36:16.816 --> 36:21.019
Stops anything this
side of a .30-06.

36:21.054 --> 36:24.089
I saw you eyeing that
guard's vest in Miami.

36:25.491 --> 36:27.793
Look, I'm...

36:27.827 --> 36:31.680
I'm sorry for dragging you
on a glorified vacation.

36:31.714 --> 36:33.665
I... I guess it was

36:33.700 --> 36:38.470
just my misguided way
of saying that I...

36:38.504 --> 36:39.838
want to be close to you.

36:39.872 --> 36:41.873
Thanks.

36:44.177 --> 36:45.744
I feel the same.

36:49.882 --> 36:52.701
I know Miami wasn't
really your scene.

36:52.735 --> 36:57.990
But my next mission is
in a much better place.

36:59.192 --> 37:02.661
Dresden.
Ah... Dresden.

37:02.695 --> 37:04.529
Harsh, cold.

37:04.564 --> 37:07.065
Come with me.
Two months, real danger.

37:07.100 --> 37:08.750
Who knows? We could
both get shot.

37:09.802 --> 37:12.203
You know I'd love to.

37:12.221 --> 37:16.041
But, um, two months is a long
time to be away from here.

37:16.075 --> 37:19.278
Mm, well...

37:19.312 --> 37:21.613
when you're ready,

37:21.648 --> 37:22.948
I'll be there.

37:22.982 --> 37:25.884
Unless, of course, you have
another woman behind the scenes.

37:27.153 --> 37:29.154
No.

37:30.490 --> 37:32.457
Not exactly.

37:35.495 --> 37:38.297
So, I have this friend.

37:38.331 --> 37:41.800
She's out of town right
now, but I'd like...

37:41.834 --> 37:43.135
for you to meet her sometime.

37:43.169 --> 37:44.936
"Friend"?

37:44.971 --> 37:46.405
Like a girlfriend?

37:46.439 --> 37:49.641
Nah... not like a girlfriend.

37:49.676 --> 37:51.677
Okay.

37:52.845 --> 37:54.313
Yeah, actually,
like a girlfriend.

37:56.349 --> 37:59.685
Well, I would, uh...
love to meet her.

38:01.521 --> 38:02.521
Perfect.

38:04.691 --> 38:06.024
Oh, no.
What?

38:06.059 --> 38:08.694
The housemaid is laying out
coffee spoons with

38:08.728 --> 38:10.362
the dinner service.

38:10.396 --> 38:12.364
There is going to be hell to pay

38:12.398 --> 38:14.599
at Downton Abbey tonight.

38:17.120 --> 38:19.271
So...

38:19.305 --> 38:20.906
Devon Woodcomb--

38:20.940 --> 38:22.274
who, last time I checked,

38:22.308 --> 38:25.210
was an extremely handsome
medical doctor--

38:25.244 --> 38:28.613
and you think he's
building a nuclear bomb?

38:28.631 --> 38:30.949
We know the location
of the bomb.

38:30.983 --> 38:34.452
We don't just think it;
we know it!

38:34.470 --> 38:35.787
Voilà!

38:35.805 --> 38:37.689
That's a Outback coupon.

38:39.559 --> 38:41.560
So it is.

38:42.829 --> 38:45.130
<i>Voilà!</i>

38:49.152 --> 38:50.802
Come with us.

38:50.837 --> 38:52.170
Let's blow this thing wide open.

38:53.206 --> 38:55.474
Yeah, fine.

38:55.508 --> 38:57.809
I've only walked
.53 miles today.

38:57.844 --> 39:00.812
Another few steps
wouldn't hurt me.

39:00.847 --> 39:02.531
You, sir, are
an American hero.

39:12.925 --> 39:14.926
He's up to something.

39:24.771 --> 39:27.773
What on earth?

39:35.214 --> 39:37.949
After we open this door,
there's no going back.

39:37.984 --> 39:40.351
Let's do this.

39:40.369 --> 39:42.120
I'm still at 1,500 steps.

39:44.574 --> 39:46.575
Oh, careful, careful.
Careful.

40:02.475 --> 40:04.376
Ahem.

40:08.397 --> 40:10.782
What are you guys doing here?
How'd you find this place?

40:10.817 --> 40:14.152
Uh, the better question is,
what are you doing here?

40:14.187 --> 40:16.988
Really, what are you doing here?
I'm-I'm confused.

40:17.023 --> 40:19.157
Ellie doesn't like

40:19.192 --> 40:20.659
my workout equipment
around the house, so...

40:20.693 --> 40:22.160
I figured this would be perfect.

40:22.195 --> 40:24.496
Chuck told me about
this abandoned basement.

40:24.530 --> 40:25.964
But...

40:25.998 --> 40:27.332
the U238.

40:27.366 --> 40:29.000
It was being delivered here.

40:29.035 --> 40:30.569
You mean this?

40:30.603 --> 40:32.938
About to make my biceps
go nuclear.

40:34.707 --> 40:36.308
Then why all the secrecy?

40:36.342 --> 40:39.878
Well, some of these exercise
techniques aren't exactly...

40:39.912 --> 40:41.296
legal... in the US.

40:41.347 --> 40:43.181
If you catch my drift.

40:43.216 --> 40:44.683
Are you two happy?

40:44.717 --> 40:46.585
Let the statuesque man

40:46.619 --> 40:48.419
work out in peace.

40:48.437 --> 40:49.754
Is that a pedometer?

40:49.772 --> 40:52.257
Got a whole box
of them upstairs.

40:52.291 --> 40:53.808
Sweet.

40:53.860 --> 40:55.260
I'll work you out a deal.

40:55.294 --> 40:57.195
Yeah, we got to work out
sometime, Big Mike.

40:57.230 --> 40:58.280
I like your style.

40:58.314 --> 40:59.931
Do a lot of working out.

40:59.966 --> 41:02.200
It's too easy.

41:04.403 --> 41:06.037
Well...

41:06.072 --> 41:08.940
The whole search... worthless.

41:08.975 --> 41:11.676
There's no spies,
no secret base.

41:11.711 --> 41:13.445
Nothing.

41:13.479 --> 41:16.314
Ah, Jeffrey, you know...

41:16.349 --> 41:20.151
maybe this wasn't a search
for a secret spy base.

41:20.186 --> 41:22.454
Maybe this was a search

41:22.488 --> 41:23.788
for friendship.

41:23.823 --> 41:25.323
How do you mean?

41:25.358 --> 41:27.325
I don't know.

41:27.360 --> 41:29.861
I just wanted to say
something to cheer you up.

41:29.896 --> 41:31.663
Would you just come here?

41:31.697 --> 41:33.064
Okay, buddy? Okay?

41:33.099 --> 41:34.499
All right, let's
get out of here.

41:34.534 --> 41:36.968
Thank you.
This place reeks.

41:37.003 --> 41:38.820
What the...?

41:45.378 --> 41:46.745
It's still wet.

41:46.779 --> 41:48.313
Oh.
Oh, yeah.

41:48.331 --> 41:50.815
Remember when I
was at Pine Ridge?

41:50.833 --> 41:52.684
The, uh, mental institution?
Yeah.

41:52.718 --> 41:54.519
It was so dreary,

41:54.554 --> 41:56.655
they'd actually put fake
backdrops in the windows.

41:56.689 --> 41:58.723
That's pretty cruel.

41:58.758 --> 42:00.842
I always knew it was fake.

42:00.876 --> 42:03.328
Um, where are we
going with this, buddy?

42:05.097 --> 42:08.350
I guess what I'm
trying to say is...

42:08.384 --> 42:12.887
it's not always easy to
trick a mental patient.

42:18.561 --> 42:19.694
I knew it!

42:19.729 --> 42:22.614
We were right!

42:22.648 --> 42:23.682
Lester...

42:27.520 --> 42:28.870
Jeffrey!

42:33.826 --> 42:35.760
Oh... crap.

42:35.795 --> 42:39.799
I mean, we got a problem.
Yeah, yeah, I'd call it that.
