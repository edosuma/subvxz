HE SOBS

01:16.385 --> 01:17.385
Urgh!

02:50.024 --> 02:51.225
Joe!

02:52.625 --> 02:53.704
Joe!
Quick, man!

02:53.744 --> 02:55.185
What's going on?

02:56.464 --> 02:58.945
There's someone in the water!
Call an ambulance!

03:55.744 --> 03:57.144
WOMAN: Walken Estates.

04:53.344 --> 04:55.505
Find it all right, ma'am?
Ooph!

04:55.545 --> 04:58.425
Who's that with Kenny?
David Walken.

04:58.464 --> 05:01.704
His dad owns the place.
Business land down here,

05:01.745 --> 05:03.584
personal estate further up there.

05:03.625 --> 05:06.305
The body's been ID'd
as his brother Dennis.

05:06.344 --> 05:08.985
What, by him?
No. By Joe Barry.

05:09.024 --> 05:11.625
And who's he?
General Manager of the farm.

05:11.664 --> 05:15.865
Well, they both look like they could
do with a cup of tea and a sit-down.

05:17.144 --> 05:19.625
Get Jac to find somewhere
a bit quieter.

05:19.664 --> 05:21.104
Ma'am, here you are.

05:30.704 --> 05:32.305
How long was he in the water?

05:32.344 --> 05:34.985
Three or four hours tops.

05:35.985 --> 05:37.305
Just a young lad.

05:38.625 --> 05:40.464
18, 19, I'd say.

05:40.505 --> 05:42.065
Baby face.

05:43.104 --> 05:45.545
No obvious signs of assault.

05:45.584 --> 05:48.305
So why not an accident or a suicide?

05:48.344 --> 05:49.985
Well, whilst I say
no obvious traces,

05:50.024 --> 05:51.584
there is an indentation here.

05:51.625 --> 05:54.344
Could he have whacked his head on
some rocks during a midnight swim?

05:54.385 --> 05:56.704
He was at a party.
My feeling is he was assaulted

05:56.745 --> 05:58.945
and then dumped into the water
afterwards.

05:58.985 --> 06:03.024
So what you're saying, that angle
suggests a blow landing from above.

06:04.104 --> 06:05.505
Precisely.

06:06.505 --> 06:08.024
Hm?

06:08.065 --> 06:10.264
What else?
Anything in his pockets?

06:10.305 --> 06:11.985
I would have told you if there was.

06:13.945 --> 06:16.185
What, there was nothing?
Not even a mobile?

06:16.224 --> 06:17.625
See previous answer.

06:18.985 --> 06:21.704
What's up Malcolm, go without
your morning coffee or what?

06:21.745 --> 06:25.945
There are some scrapes here
on his left knuckles.

06:25.985 --> 06:27.625
Well, that's something else,
isn't it?

06:27.664 --> 06:29.305
Possibly from punching someone.

06:29.344 --> 06:30.985
He could have been in a fight.

06:31.024 --> 06:32.144
Ah...

06:32.185 --> 06:35.144
That could be from being
tossed about in the water.

06:35.185 --> 06:38.825
Well, I'll give you some definitive
answers as soon as possible, OK?

06:38.865 --> 06:41.104
Aye, well, let me know
as soon as you find anything else.

06:41.144 --> 06:42.224
Will do.

06:42.264 --> 06:45.104
Yeah, and I'll have a coffee
sent down for you, love.

06:45.144 --> 06:46.904
I hate to see you miserable.

06:52.185 --> 06:54.985
The deceased didn't live on the
estate, he had a bedsit in Harbury.

06:55.024 --> 06:56.704
Have you got an address?
Yeah.

06:56.745 --> 06:57.825
Right.

06:57.865 --> 07:00.784
And what about witness statements?
There's a lot to get through.

07:00.825 --> 07:03.745
The guests from the party
last night, staff, extended family.

07:08.945 --> 07:11.065
What about CCTV?

07:11.104 --> 07:13.024
The cameras here all point inwards,

07:13.065 --> 07:15.264
so there's no coverage
of where the body was found.

07:16.825 --> 07:19.664
But he might not have gone
into the water here.

07:22.545 --> 07:25.224
He could have drifted in
from pretty much anywhere.

07:26.385 --> 07:29.024
Right, where's this house, then?

07:59.144 --> 08:02.024
The size of the house...
I know.

08:02.065 --> 08:04.065
Luxury cars.

08:04.104 --> 08:06.305
The salmon business must be booming.

08:09.305 --> 08:12.344
So, is all of this land theirs, then?

08:12.385 --> 08:14.584
Apparently they've got
a private mooring.

08:14.625 --> 08:17.185
And their son
was living in a bedsit...

08:21.625 --> 08:23.825
Right, can you tell them we're here?

08:31.625 --> 08:33.784
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

08:46.265 --> 08:49.185
I thought it was one of my boys.

08:49.224 --> 08:51.025
You hear something like that and...

08:52.025 --> 08:53.905
..immediately think the worst.

08:55.025 --> 08:58.704
But we understood Dennis
was one of your boys, Mrs Walken.

08:58.744 --> 09:00.025
What?

09:00.065 --> 09:01.265
No.

09:02.545 --> 09:04.025
Dennis was...

09:05.545 --> 09:06.945
..not my son.

09:07.945 --> 09:09.104
He was mine.

09:10.104 --> 09:12.104
One of my boys.
Oh, Mr Walken.

09:12.145 --> 09:13.864
DCI Vera Stanhope.

09:13.905 --> 09:15.185
This is DS Healy.

09:15.224 --> 09:18.025
We are so sorry for your loss.

09:24.065 --> 09:28.265
Now, we understand Dennis attended
the party here last night.

09:28.305 --> 09:29.665
That's right.

09:29.704 --> 09:31.545
But he didn't live here with you.

09:31.584 --> 09:32.905
No.

09:32.945 --> 09:37.145
Now, can you recall the time when
you last saw your son, Mr Walken?

09:37.185 --> 09:39.344
I mean, last night, I assume.

09:39.384 --> 09:41.504
Around 10:00 or 11:00, I think.

09:41.545 --> 09:43.905
Can you remember?
I'm not sure.

09:43.945 --> 09:46.665
But, yes, around that time.

09:46.704 --> 09:48.864
I went up about ten-ish.

09:48.905 --> 09:51.464
That's a bit early
to leave your own party.

09:51.504 --> 09:53.305
My wife's receiving
cancer treatment.

09:53.344 --> 09:54.704
She gets tired.

09:54.744 --> 09:57.864
I stayed up for a couple more
drinks, but I wasn't far behind her.

10:00.305 --> 10:02.265
Did Dennis have a lot to drink?

10:02.305 --> 10:04.584
A fair bit, yes.
Birthday, was it?

10:04.624 --> 10:06.825
Our wedding anniversary.

10:06.864 --> 10:08.185
30 years.

10:09.185 --> 10:10.584
Well, congratulations.

10:12.744 --> 10:15.584
Now, we're investigating
the possibility

10:15.624 --> 10:18.224
that Dennis was assaulted last night.

10:18.265 --> 10:20.425
Assaulted?
Oh, my God...!

10:20.464 --> 10:22.704
Did he have an argument
or a disagreement with anybody?

10:22.744 --> 10:23.905
No.

10:23.945 --> 10:25.265
Not that I saw.

10:25.305 --> 10:27.185
Did he enjoy the party?

10:27.224 --> 10:28.464
Yes.
He was quiet.

10:28.504 --> 10:30.825
He didn't really know anyone, so...

10:30.864 --> 10:32.504
He spoke to loads of people.

10:32.545 --> 10:34.704
I'm just saying,
it was complicated for him.

10:34.744 --> 10:36.584
It was complicated for all of us.

10:41.545 --> 10:43.665
He'd not long been in our lives.

10:43.704 --> 10:45.624
A few months.

10:47.145 --> 10:49.945
Did you know you had another son,
Mr Walken?

10:49.984 --> 10:51.665
No.

10:51.704 --> 10:53.864
How about your other boys?

10:53.905 --> 10:56.744
How did they take it?
David and Dennis got along well.

10:56.785 --> 10:58.984
And Josh, our eldest...

11:00.384 --> 11:01.905
..we don't see Josh.

11:01.945 --> 11:03.704
Since when is that?

11:03.744 --> 11:05.464
Three years.

11:05.504 --> 11:07.624
He lives in Stockholm now.

11:07.665 --> 11:10.584
So does he know
he had another brother?

11:10.624 --> 11:12.104
No.

11:12.145 --> 11:13.624
They never met.

11:17.905 --> 11:19.425
HEALY: All right, great. Thanks.

11:19.464 --> 11:22.384
Jac's found an address
for Dennis' mother.

11:26.825 --> 11:30.104
STANHOPE: I'm afraid I am going
to have to ask you some questions.

11:30.145 --> 11:32.984
Can you tell me
when you last saw Dennis?

11:33.025 --> 11:34.584
It's been a while.

11:36.185 --> 11:37.584
Wednesday.

11:38.785 --> 11:40.665
I saw him Wednesday.
Not for long.

11:40.704 --> 11:42.145
I didn't want to upset you.

11:44.305 --> 11:47.145
I'd bought him
a toastie maker thing.

11:47.185 --> 11:49.305
You know, and...

11:49.344 --> 11:52.545
But before that, yeah,
I hadn't seen him for a while.

11:57.825 --> 11:59.785
What happened to him?

12:00.825 --> 12:02.984
Well, I'm sorry
to have to tell you this, love...

12:04.065 --> 12:07.025
..but we are treating
your son's death as suspicious.

12:07.065 --> 12:08.825
What do you mean?

12:08.864 --> 12:10.425
Who?

12:10.464 --> 12:12.305
Who would want to hurt him?

12:12.344 --> 12:14.025
Who?

12:16.744 --> 12:19.945
Now, you say you last saw Dennis
on Wednesday.

12:19.984 --> 12:21.984
Is that right?
Yeah.

12:22.025 --> 12:24.464
How did he seem?

12:25.504 --> 12:26.945
He was lost.

12:28.145 --> 12:29.624
He was just lost.

12:40.025 --> 12:41.545
Mr Bayliss...

12:43.344 --> 12:45.704
..is it all right if we take photos?

12:45.744 --> 12:47.145
Yeah.

12:48.185 --> 12:50.185
Did he do all this himself?
Initially.

12:50.224 --> 12:53.265
Then he worked with another lad
who'd, er...

12:53.305 --> 12:56.065
..who'd found his own birth father
a couple of years back.

12:56.104 --> 12:58.945
And do you know
this other lad's name?

12:58.984 --> 13:01.704
I didn't have anything
to do with it. I'm... I'm sorry.

13:03.665 --> 13:05.464
When did he start all this?

13:05.504 --> 13:08.425
His ex-girlfriend bought him
a DNA kit for his birthday.

13:08.464 --> 13:10.704
She did one as well.
They thought it would be fun.

13:11.984 --> 13:15.704
He didn't realise he'd automatically
be matched up with close relatives.

13:17.344 --> 13:18.864
Neither did we.

13:18.905 --> 13:20.185
Mm.

13:20.224 --> 13:21.984
Until then, he thought you were...?

13:22.025 --> 13:24.384
That I was his dad, yeah.

13:26.864 --> 13:28.545
How did he take it?

13:28.584 --> 13:30.785
He was angry.

13:31.785 --> 13:34.025
Lots of screaming and shouting.

13:34.065 --> 13:37.224
Then came the emotional distance,
barely speaking to us.

13:37.265 --> 13:40.665
He'd stay up here, working on this,
trying to track down his...

13:41.665 --> 13:42.825
..his father.

13:44.825 --> 13:48.025
So, he didn't move out straight away?
No.

13:48.065 --> 13:50.624
It was a few months later.

13:50.665 --> 13:53.624
And that's when the relationship
between the three of you broke down.

13:53.665 --> 13:56.785
Occasionally he'd see Steph,
when she pestered him enough.

13:56.825 --> 13:58.504
But, yeah,
we were pretty broken then.

14:00.825 --> 14:02.945
Is this the ex-girlfriend?

14:02.984 --> 14:04.984
Yes. Phoebe.

14:11.984 --> 14:13.624
When did they split up?

14:13.665 --> 14:16.945
Not long after she left for uni
last year.

14:16.984 --> 14:19.545
Mm.
And whose decision was that?

14:19.584 --> 14:21.905
Hers.
He was devastated.

14:21.945 --> 14:23.744
He was more or less
living over there

14:23.785 --> 14:25.945
with her and her family
before she left.

14:26.864 --> 14:28.425
Jamie was really good to him.

14:29.504 --> 14:31.384
Jamie?
Phoebe's dad.

14:31.425 --> 14:32.945
Dennis worked for him.

14:34.224 --> 14:35.704
Can I hang on to this?

14:35.744 --> 14:37.545
Go ahead.

14:50.624 --> 14:52.065
Fishing.

14:52.104 --> 14:53.825
That was our thing.

15:12.545 --> 15:14.704
All that time calling someone Dad.

15:14.744 --> 15:16.464
He was his dad.

15:16.504 --> 15:18.464
Yeah, I know.
But not biologically.

15:18.504 --> 15:21.265
Well, what's that
compared to a lifetime of parenting?

15:22.425 --> 15:23.704
SHE SIGHS

15:23.744 --> 15:26.665
She can only have been a kid herself
when she had Dennis.

15:26.704 --> 15:27.785
Yeah.

15:29.425 --> 15:31.665
The whole of her adult life
being a mam.

15:33.344 --> 15:35.145
19 years of milestones.

15:35.185 --> 15:37.065
And then, suddenly, that's it.

15:38.464 --> 15:39.624
Gone.

15:42.344 --> 15:43.665
ENGINE STARTS

16:20.825 --> 16:22.224
Aiden...

16:24.905 --> 16:26.624
Anti-anxiety meds.

16:29.825 --> 16:31.545
Not prescribed.

16:32.984 --> 16:34.185
John...

16:40.584 --> 16:42.744
Aiden, see if there's anything
under there.

16:50.305 --> 16:51.984
Ah, John, laptop.

16:56.265 --> 16:58.984
Dennis Bayliss, 19 years old.

16:59.025 --> 17:01.624
He was pulled out of the sea
this morning,

17:01.665 --> 17:04.025
adjacent to the Walkens' fish farm.

17:04.065 --> 17:06.265
Now, the timeline goes like this...

17:06.305 --> 17:09.464
He was seen by a neighbour, Pat Ross,

17:09.505 --> 17:13.184
leaving his bedsit yesterday
round about 6:00pm.

17:13.224 --> 17:18.584
An eyewitness has him leaving
the party at about 1:00am, 2:00am.

17:18.624 --> 17:23.545
Malcolm has him dead in the water
at approximately 4:00am.

17:23.584 --> 17:26.464
So, what happened to him
in those two hours?

17:26.505 --> 17:29.465
I checked the camera at the main
gate to the estate, ma'am.

17:29.505 --> 17:32.025
He was seen coming in on foot
at 7:30 last night,

17:32.065 --> 17:33.664
but he didn't leave by that gate.

17:33.705 --> 17:36.864
But that's the only way off
the estate, isn't it? Yeah.

17:36.904 --> 17:39.144
Well, maybe he left in a car
with one of the other guests.

17:39.184 --> 17:40.545
Check it out.

17:41.985 --> 17:45.424
So, let's not assume he died
where we found him.

17:45.465 --> 17:47.985
I mean, he could've floated in
from anywhere.

17:48.025 --> 17:53.265
And let's scour the coastline
for any evidence of an assault.

17:53.305 --> 17:56.985
According to Joe Barry, the business
is locked and secure overnight.

17:57.025 --> 17:59.985
There's no way point of entry
could have be down through the farm.

18:01.344 --> 18:04.104
Now, this party was held
by the lad's biological father.

18:04.144 --> 18:05.664
That's Thomas Walken.

18:05.705 --> 18:07.944
Who he'd recently found
via a DNA database.

18:07.985 --> 18:09.664
It took the family by storm.

18:09.705 --> 18:11.904
He used one of those
genealogy home test kits.

18:11.944 --> 18:13.944
What, and the dad
happened to be on there as well?

18:13.985 --> 18:16.785
What? No. He claims
he didn't know the lad existed.

18:16.825 --> 18:19.624
It's more than likely he matched up
with another blood relative

18:19.664 --> 18:21.384
and then found his father that way.

18:21.424 --> 18:22.825
Now, I want two things.

18:22.864 --> 18:24.664
Where he went into the water.

18:24.705 --> 18:27.584
And when he left the party,
was he with anyone?

18:27.624 --> 18:30.745
And let's continue to get
as many witness statements

18:30.785 --> 18:34.624
from the party as possible today,
while it's all still fresh.

18:34.664 --> 18:37.465
And, Kenny,
what about the lad's mobile?

18:37.505 --> 18:39.864
Have we found it?
No, not yet, ma'am.

18:39.904 --> 18:42.265
But we did find his travel pass
at his flat.

18:42.305 --> 18:44.465
We traced his current account
from it.

18:44.505 --> 18:47.745
He had a standing order with
his mobile phone service provider.

18:47.785 --> 18:50.785
I've requested a full breakdown
of all incoming and outgoing calls.

18:50.825 --> 18:52.104
Ah, great.

18:52.144 --> 18:54.424
These are instant messages
from his laptop,

18:54.465 --> 18:58.184
all from the past 48 hours and
all from his ex-girlfriend Phoebe.

18:58.225 --> 18:59.944
Ex-girlfriend?

18:59.985 --> 19:03.825
Doesn't look so ex to me, if these
messages are anything to go by.

19:04.985 --> 19:06.624
Get your coat.

19:09.305 --> 19:11.664
When did you last see Dennis,
Phoebe?

19:12.664 --> 19:14.184
A few weeks ago.

19:15.305 --> 19:17.864
So you remained friends
after you split up.

19:17.904 --> 19:19.664
He was going through a lot.

19:19.705 --> 19:22.065
I couldn't just cut him out
of my life.

19:22.104 --> 19:24.985
A lot, as in family stuff?
Finding his dad and all that, aye.

19:25.025 --> 19:27.265
Did you help him with his search?

19:27.305 --> 19:30.825
Initially, but once he got into it,
it was all about him and Vinay,

19:30.864 --> 19:33.384
a guy he met online
through a genealogy forum.

19:33.424 --> 19:36.384
Do you have a number for him?
I hardly knew him.

19:38.025 --> 19:41.144
Are you all right, pet? Do you want
me to get someone to be with you?

19:41.184 --> 19:44.065
I'll just go home.
You're not going to be sick?

19:44.104 --> 19:47.705
Every time he went over
to Thomas Walken's it ended badly.

19:52.505 --> 19:54.624
When did you last speak to Dennis?

19:54.664 --> 19:56.065
Late last night.

19:57.545 --> 19:59.864
He wanted to come over,
but I said no.

19:59.904 --> 20:01.424
What time was this?

20:01.465 --> 20:03.584
Just before 2:00, I think.

20:03.624 --> 20:06.584
And can you remember what he said?
He wasn't really making any sense.

20:06.624 --> 20:08.785
He just kept saying,
"It had all come out."

20:08.825 --> 20:11.384
What did he mean by that?
No idea.

20:11.424 --> 20:13.985
They never wanted him, though,
I know that.

20:14.025 --> 20:16.225
It was obvious to everyone
but Dennis.

20:23.383 --> 20:24.984
It all happened so fast.

20:26.023 --> 20:28.944
It's hard to believe. We'd only
know each other a few months.

20:30.184 --> 20:31.704
But it must have been difficult

20:31.744 --> 20:33.744
having a long-lost brother
turning up.

20:34.744 --> 20:36.944
Maybe for him.
But not for you?

20:36.984 --> 20:39.704
Obviously, it was a bit odd
when he first appeared.

20:39.744 --> 20:43.144
But you were all getting along,
were you?

20:43.184 --> 20:46.383
And you and Dennis
didn't have an arguments last night?

20:46.424 --> 20:49.504
You know things coming to a head,
that sort of thing.

20:49.543 --> 20:52.543
We did have words, yeah.
But nothing...

20:53.823 --> 20:55.144
..you know, major.

20:55.184 --> 20:58.623
What did you have words about?
I can't even remember.

20:58.664 --> 21:03.303
I think I suggested a cab,
but he wanted to carry on drinking.

21:03.343 --> 21:05.103
Did you get him a cab?
No.

21:05.144 --> 21:07.823
Why not?
Because he didn't want me to.

21:07.863 --> 21:11.424
So, did it get physical?
Not at all.

21:11.464 --> 21:13.063
Are you sure about that?

21:13.103 --> 21:14.704
Absolutely!

21:14.744 --> 21:16.664
Dennis could be difficult.

21:16.704 --> 21:20.303
One minute, he'd be great. The next
minute, he'd be sulking like a kid.

21:21.664 --> 21:23.144
He was a kid.
I know.

21:23.184 --> 21:25.103
I'm just saying,
he could be a bit up and down.

21:25.144 --> 21:28.783
So, this was nothing serious,
this argument?

21:28.823 --> 21:31.144
No.
He had some daft idea in his head

21:31.184 --> 21:33.343
that Dad didn't really want him
at the party.

21:33.383 --> 21:36.583
And did he?
He was there, wasn't he?

21:37.744 --> 21:40.023
Was your dad involved
in this argument?

21:41.623 --> 21:43.023
No.

21:44.184 --> 21:46.303
So, tell us about the business.

21:46.343 --> 21:47.504
Hm?

21:48.823 --> 21:50.984
Was Dennis interested in that?

21:51.023 --> 21:52.783
He was interested in the fish.

21:52.823 --> 21:54.744
Always asking to be taken out there.

21:55.944 --> 21:57.623
And did you take him out?

21:57.664 --> 21:59.984
Not personally. But he went out
there once or twice, yeah.

22:01.704 --> 22:04.063
And how's the business doing?

22:06.063 --> 22:08.343
Making money, is it?

22:09.424 --> 22:11.264
Yeah, it's doing well.

22:11.303 --> 22:15.184
We've had a small problem with
poaching, but nothing significant.

22:15.224 --> 22:16.583
Right.

22:17.863 --> 22:21.023
Yeah, well, thanks, David.
That's all for now.

22:32.264 --> 22:33.863
Cause of death, blunt object.

22:33.904 --> 22:36.664
I'd say 15 centimetres wide.

22:36.704 --> 22:39.103
Brought down with extreme force.

22:39.144 --> 22:41.623
Already dead when he hit the water.
Yes.

22:42.904 --> 22:45.504
What about those scratches
on his hand? Oh, they're nothing.

22:45.543 --> 22:49.744
But he does have some bruising
on the upper right arm.

22:51.823 --> 22:55.343
You can see there
and then a larger one here.

23:00.144 --> 23:01.984
Fingers and thumb?
I'd say so.

23:02.984 --> 23:04.464
Toxicology.

23:10.303 --> 23:12.504
Methylphenidate?
Yes. It's a, erm...

23:12.543 --> 23:15.464
Yes, it's a first-line
stimulant medication

23:15.504 --> 23:18.783
used to treat attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder.

23:18.823 --> 23:20.184
Thank you.

23:20.224 --> 23:22.424
Fluoxetine, diazepam...

23:22.464 --> 23:25.623
You name it, it's on there.
So, he's popping uppers and downers.

23:25.664 --> 23:26.944
Mm-hm.

23:26.984 --> 23:28.424
Excuse me.

23:28.464 --> 23:29.984
The parents have arrived early.

23:30.023 --> 23:31.504
Give us five minutes, please.

23:33.264 --> 23:34.583
They're keen.

23:34.623 --> 23:35.623
Oh...

23:36.863 --> 23:38.664
What?

23:47.744 --> 23:49.144
Are you ready?

23:50.543 --> 23:51.904
Mr Bayliss?

23:59.823 --> 24:01.623
THEY BOTH SOB

24:23.543 --> 24:24.904
Right, look...

24:27.744 --> 24:30.744
I am going to find out
what happened to your son.

24:30.783 --> 24:32.543
I can promise you that.

24:32.583 --> 24:34.704
But to help me do that...

24:35.744 --> 24:37.464
..I need to ask you
a couple of questions.

24:37.504 --> 24:39.664
Is that all right?
Yeah.

24:39.704 --> 24:41.023
You're sure?

24:42.704 --> 24:44.543
Now, this morning,

24:44.583 --> 24:47.184
you told me Dennis was lost.

24:47.224 --> 24:49.343
What did you mean by that?

24:49.383 --> 24:52.543
One minute, he'd be open, talkative.

24:52.583 --> 24:55.944
And the next, it was like
getting blood out of a stone.

24:55.984 --> 24:59.744
Was he ever diagnosed
with any kind of anxiety disorder?

24:59.783 --> 25:01.944
There's nothing official.
No?

25:03.144 --> 25:06.543
He'd been on the waiting list
for counselling for six months.

25:06.583 --> 25:09.343
So, he wasn't on
any prescription tablets.

25:10.424 --> 25:11.783
Definitely not, no.

25:11.823 --> 25:16.383
Did he ever talk to you about
his relationship with the Walkens?

25:16.424 --> 25:17.623
Hardly.

25:19.184 --> 25:21.383
Did you get the feeling
he was close to them?

25:22.464 --> 25:23.704
Not as close as he wanted.

25:23.744 --> 25:26.023
They'd make plans with him,

25:26.063 --> 25:29.224
but when the time came, they'd...
they'd fall through.

25:29.264 --> 25:30.984
He'd be devastated.

25:32.144 --> 25:35.264
He'd try and hide it,
but I could tell.

25:35.303 --> 25:37.224
SHE SOBS

25:37.264 --> 25:38.944
Hey, it's all right, love.

25:38.984 --> 25:41.383
Beverley's going to get you home.

25:51.464 --> 25:53.144
STANHOPE:
A young, unstable lad

25:53.184 --> 25:55.383
finds his birth father.

25:55.424 --> 25:57.264
The family have no idea he exists,

25:57.303 --> 25:59.464
until he comes knocking
on their door.

25:59.504 --> 26:01.984
Now was he after a job?

26:02.023 --> 26:04.823
Did he want to be part of the family?
Or was he after money?

26:04.863 --> 26:07.063
They've got plenty of it.
Oh, aye.

26:08.023 --> 26:10.343
Now, the mam and the ex-girlfriend

26:10.383 --> 26:13.823
say it was an emotionally draining
road for the lad.

26:13.863 --> 26:16.623
Contact with the Walkens
meant trouble for him

26:16.664 --> 26:18.023
and anyone around him.

26:18.063 --> 26:20.184
But according to the Walkens...

26:20.224 --> 26:23.144
..it's been relatively drama-free.

26:23.184 --> 26:25.464
And what do we make of these bruises?

26:26.984 --> 26:30.184
Now, they're only on
the upper right arm,

26:30.224 --> 26:31.823
nowhere else on the body.

26:31.863 --> 26:33.863
Aiden, come here.

26:33.904 --> 26:37.424
Now, it looks like that thumb
was really digging in.

26:37.464 --> 26:39.583
Like he'd been grabbed, hm?

26:39.623 --> 26:42.464
PHONE RINGS
And then pulled or dragged.

26:42.504 --> 26:44.343
So, what does that tell us, hm?

26:44.383 --> 26:46.944
That the argument with David Walken
escalated?

26:46.984 --> 26:50.303
Yeah, but what else does it tell us?
I mean, how am I be standing?

26:50.343 --> 26:53.383
So, whoever grabbed him,
might have been left-handed.

26:53.424 --> 26:54.863
Jackpot, Kenny!

26:54.904 --> 26:59.103
Find out if either David
or Thomas Walken is left-handed.

26:59.144 --> 27:02.184
Now, he also had a cocktail of drugs
in his system.

27:02.224 --> 27:04.823
So, he was buying uppers and downers
from someone.

27:04.863 --> 27:07.424
Kenny, run a check
on anyone with previous

27:07.464 --> 27:11.424
for selling prescription drugs
and see if they were at that party.

27:11.464 --> 27:13.623
He could've had a run-in
with a dealer.

27:13.664 --> 27:16.543
Now, this is a printout
of the online genealogy forum

27:16.583 --> 27:18.184
Parent Not Expected.

27:18.224 --> 27:21.504
The admin is a guy called
Vinay Deol.

27:21.543 --> 27:23.984
Yeah, known as a Search Angel.

27:24.023 --> 27:26.224
And what's that when it's at home?

27:26.264 --> 27:28.623
Well, it means he's your main man,
Kenny.

27:28.664 --> 27:32.023
A little bit like me. Not too sure
about the angel bit, ma'am.

27:32.063 --> 27:34.224
SHE CHUCKLES
Now, he helped Dennis get from

27:34.264 --> 27:35.863
the match in the database
to his father.

27:35.904 --> 27:40.224
So I want to talk to this Search
Angel, Kenny, as soon as. Ma'am.

27:40.264 --> 27:41.704
Er, ma'am...

27:41.744 --> 27:44.023
I've just spoken with
Dennis' employer,

27:44.063 --> 27:46.063
a Dwyer Electrical Installations.

27:46.103 --> 27:48.424
Is that Phoebe's dad's company?
Yeah.

27:48.464 --> 27:50.623
They're working
down on the Warbreck today.

27:50.664 --> 27:53.303
I thought you might want to pay them
a visit yourself.

27:53.343 --> 27:55.023
Aye, I do.
Thanks, Mark.

27:57.904 --> 27:59.783
MAN: I hear you're here
to talk about Dennis.

27:59.823 --> 28:00.944
Aye.

28:01.944 --> 28:03.264
I can't believe it.

28:03.303 --> 28:06.424
How did he seem to you
these last few weeks?

28:06.464 --> 28:07.944
He definitely hadn't been himself.

28:07.984 --> 28:09.063
Hm.

28:09.103 --> 28:10.464
Turning up late.

28:10.504 --> 28:12.023
Or not turning up at all.

28:12.063 --> 28:14.664
And that was out of character?
Oh, yeah.

28:14.704 --> 28:17.464
I mean, it was probably our Phoebe
leaving for uni

28:17.504 --> 28:19.704
that started him off with the late
nights and what not,

28:19.744 --> 28:21.504
but before that he was coping great.

28:21.543 --> 28:23.144
Considering.

28:24.383 --> 28:25.904
Considering what?

28:25.944 --> 28:28.424
All the business
with the DNA testing.

28:28.464 --> 28:32.664
I told Rob years ago
they should tell the lad the truth.

28:33.704 --> 28:35.664
Do you know Rob Bayliss personally?

28:35.704 --> 28:38.264
We're not close, like, but, er...

28:38.303 --> 28:41.343
..when he first got with Steph,
I knew him a fair bit, you know?

28:41.383 --> 28:44.744
He fell in love with her
and her baby.

28:44.783 --> 28:46.504
Doted on them both.

28:46.543 --> 28:49.664
And he got back in touch when Dennis
was looking for an apprenticeship.

28:49.704 --> 28:52.184
When was he last in work?
Friday.

28:52.224 --> 28:55.063
We finished up around 4:00,
went over to The Two Boars.

28:55.103 --> 28:56.744
Hey...
Where are you going?

28:56.783 --> 28:59.464
Er, the shop.
Liam...!

29:01.103 --> 29:02.823
He's my lad.

29:02.863 --> 29:05.063
Well, then,
he would have known Dennis as well.

29:05.103 --> 29:06.583
Aye.

29:06.623 --> 29:09.023
I can't say they were great pals,
mind.

29:09.063 --> 29:12.184
Big brother protecting
his little sister, I suppose.

29:12.224 --> 29:14.664
Did Dennis ever confide in you?

29:15.863 --> 29:17.783
I mean,
was there anything significant

29:17.823 --> 29:19.984
that might have been troubling him
lately?

29:20.023 --> 29:23.023
There was something.
Go on...

29:23.063 --> 29:26.744
He said he was beginning to think
his father knew about him all along,

29:26.783 --> 29:30.103
which obviously made him feel,
well, you know...

29:30.144 --> 29:31.984
..all sorts of stuff.

29:32.023 --> 29:33.383
Mm-hm.

29:33.424 --> 29:36.744
Right, well,
thanks for your time, Mr Dwyer.

29:36.783 --> 29:38.224
All right.

29:49.023 --> 29:50.264
Oh...

29:50.303 --> 29:51.704
Lovely.

29:52.904 --> 29:54.063
Thanks.

29:55.063 --> 29:56.704
Mm...

29:56.744 --> 29:59.184
You haven't got peas in with mine,
have you?

29:59.224 --> 30:01.383
Have I ever got the peas in
with yours?  Yes!

30:01.424 --> 30:02.984
Once! One time.

30:04.063 --> 30:05.103
Here...

30:05.144 --> 30:06.984
PHONE RINGS
Separate peas.

30:07.023 --> 30:08.823
I don't want peas!

30:08.863 --> 30:10.664
DCI Stanhope.

30:13.543 --> 30:14.823
Right.

30:15.984 --> 30:17.623
Seatbelt.
ENGINE STARTS

30:17.664 --> 30:21.063
Someone's just tried
to break into Dennis' bedsit.

30:22.664 --> 30:25.264
So what happened, exactly?
I heard a noise.

30:25.303 --> 30:27.063
You know, like someone
trying to get in.

30:27.103 --> 30:29.583
So, I come out and there he was,
with his hand in the letterbox,

30:29.623 --> 30:30.783
trying to open the door.

30:30.823 --> 30:32.984
I asked him what he was playing at
and he just ran off.

30:33.023 --> 30:35.704
What did this fella look like?
Young.

30:35.744 --> 30:37.704
No hair.
You know, shaved, like.

30:37.744 --> 30:39.863
About the same age as Dennis.

30:39.904 --> 30:41.264
And what was he wearing?

30:41.303 --> 30:44.944
Red hoodie, black trousers,
with the pockets in the side.

30:44.984 --> 30:47.744
Have I been a help?
Aye, you have, love.

30:47.783 --> 30:49.623
Next time you think
someone's breaking in,

30:49.664 --> 30:51.543
can you call the police first?

30:59.063 --> 31:00.424
Next left.

31:00.464 --> 31:02.224
Yes, I know!

31:08.744 --> 31:12.144
STANHOPE:
There he is, the little treasure.

31:18.023 --> 31:19.224
After him!

31:19.264 --> 31:20.303
Oi!

31:58.303 --> 31:59.944
Come on, Liam.

32:13.483 --> 32:16.603
So, the manager of The Two Boars
remembers Dennis and Liam

32:16.642 --> 32:18.362
drinking at the bar together.

32:18.402 --> 32:21.083
She said, "It looked like
they might have been having words,

32:21.122 --> 32:23.722
"but I didn't actually hear
what was said."  Ah.

32:23.763 --> 32:24.922
Thanks, Jac.

32:24.962 --> 32:26.882
Ma'am, we've found nothing new
at Dennis' flat.

32:26.922 --> 32:29.563
And there was nothing
on Liam's person.

32:29.603 --> 32:31.843
But we found these in his work van.

32:34.882 --> 32:36.323
Good Morning.

32:36.362 --> 32:37.642
DOOR CLOSES

32:37.682 --> 32:40.202
DCI Stanhope enters the room.

32:41.682 --> 32:43.323
Did you have a good sleep?

32:45.722 --> 32:47.162
Yeah, that's good.

32:48.642 --> 32:52.202
Oh, that was quite a chase
last night.

32:53.202 --> 32:54.642
Why did you run?

32:58.162 --> 33:00.362
Did you see Dennis
on Saturday night?

33:00.402 --> 33:01.722
No.

33:01.763 --> 33:04.603
Are you sure about that?
A hundred percent.

33:04.642 --> 33:08.442
What can you tell us
about Dennis popping pills?

33:10.323 --> 33:12.323
Did he get them from you?

33:12.362 --> 33:13.922
No.

33:13.962 --> 33:16.603
Is that why we found the same pills
in your van?

33:16.642 --> 33:19.122
Forensics are going over that van
right now, ma'am.

33:19.162 --> 33:21.442
Oooh...
What else will they find?

33:22.922 --> 33:24.763
Dennis' DNA, perhaps.

33:24.803 --> 33:26.122
No.

33:26.162 --> 33:28.323
I mean, I don't know.
Maybe.

33:28.362 --> 33:29.922
But it's...

33:29.962 --> 33:32.603
What, do you think I had something
to do with his death?

33:32.642 --> 33:34.803
Well, did you?
No!

33:36.882 --> 33:38.882
What can you tell us
about the Walkens?

33:38.922 --> 33:40.243
Nothing.

33:40.283 --> 33:43.483
Well, you know Thomas Walken
is Dennis' dad.

33:43.523 --> 33:44.803
Yeah.

33:44.843 --> 33:47.402
And you know Dennis was at a party
there on Saturday night.

33:47.442 --> 33:49.202
No, why would I?

33:49.243 --> 33:51.402
Did you go to the party?
Me? No.

33:51.442 --> 33:54.603
Did you meet Dennis after the party,
outside the Walken Estate?

33:54.642 --> 33:55.763
No.

33:55.803 --> 33:58.882
According to witnesses
at The Two Boars pub,

33:58.922 --> 34:01.402
you were with Dennis on Friday night

34:01.442 --> 34:03.962
between 4:45 and closing time.

34:05.083 --> 34:06.803
So, you had an argument.

34:06.843 --> 34:09.083
What was the argument about?

34:09.121 --> 34:11.322
Look, we didn't argue.
Well, their CCTV,

34:11.362 --> 34:13.762
which my officers
are going through right now,

34:13.802 --> 34:15.563
will say that you did.

34:17.282 --> 34:18.681
Come on, Liam.

34:20.523 --> 34:22.641
Dennis was the one selling pills.

34:22.681 --> 34:25.003
Nothing big time,
just every now and then.

34:25.043 --> 34:27.282
And I knew he'd have a stash of them
in the flat.

34:27.322 --> 34:29.523
Didn't you think,
if there where pills in that flat,

34:29.563 --> 34:31.802
my officers
would have confiscated them?

34:33.362 --> 34:35.641
So what was the argument about?

34:35.681 --> 34:37.641
We didn't argue.
You were seen!

34:37.681 --> 34:39.282
Stood at the bar!

34:39.322 --> 34:41.003
I...
I owed him money.

34:41.043 --> 34:42.242
50 quid for pills.

34:42.282 --> 34:43.722
And he wanted it back.

34:43.762 --> 34:45.882
Oh, pull the other one, Liam.

34:45.922 --> 34:48.563
What?
A young lad, younger than you,

34:48.603 --> 34:51.963
goes through
a huge emotional upheaval.

34:52.003 --> 34:53.762
He finds out his dad's not his dad,

34:53.802 --> 34:56.161
his girlfriend gives him
the heave-ho,

34:56.202 --> 34:57.682
he's living in a bedsit

34:57.722 --> 34:59.403
and he's estranged from his mam.

34:59.443 --> 35:02.563
Now, I could believe
he started to use drugs.

35:02.603 --> 35:05.642
But I don't buy
that he started to sell.

35:05.682 --> 35:07.122
Well, he did.

35:08.202 --> 35:09.483
OK.

35:09.523 --> 35:10.963
All right.

35:11.003 --> 35:13.443
So, who was he selling to?

35:13.483 --> 35:14.923
Hm?

35:16.563 --> 35:20.003
I mean, if you're so sure
he's selling, who's he selling to?

35:20.043 --> 35:22.842
Lads at work?
People down the pub?

35:22.883 --> 35:25.443
And if you didn't get into his flat,

35:25.483 --> 35:29.202
how come this lot
ended up in your van?

35:35.802 --> 35:37.162
Take him to his cell.

35:44.443 --> 35:46.722
Interview terminated at 8:17.

35:47.842 --> 35:49.242
I just..

35:49.282 --> 35:52.563
There's something I'm not getting
about these pills.

35:52.603 --> 35:55.202
I don't think Dennis was selling.

35:55.242 --> 35:57.842
But do you know what?
I don't think he was, either.

35:57.883 --> 35:59.443
Well, someone was.

36:00.523 --> 36:01.523
Oh...

36:03.682 --> 36:06.483
What else are these stimulants
used for? I don't know.

36:06.523 --> 36:07.682
Come on...

36:07.722 --> 36:10.563
Study aids.
So, where's the perfect market?

36:10.603 --> 36:12.122
A university campus.

36:12.162 --> 36:14.523
Aye.
So, who's the most likely dealer?

36:21.403 --> 36:22.923
PHOEBE: Is Liam OK?

36:22.963 --> 36:24.923
When can he come home?

36:24.963 --> 36:28.122
When I'm satisfied he had nothing
to do with Dennis' death, love.

36:28.162 --> 36:29.963
He hasn't.
He wouldn't.

36:30.003 --> 36:32.682
What can you tell us
about Dennis' flat, Phoebe?

36:32.722 --> 36:33.963
His flat?

36:34.003 --> 36:36.483
Can you think of any reason
why someone would try to break in?

36:36.523 --> 36:38.842
Maybe to take something of value.

36:38.883 --> 36:40.122
What like?

36:40.162 --> 36:41.483
Money.

36:41.523 --> 36:43.162
Drugs.

36:45.003 --> 36:46.842
Are you going to arrest me, too?

36:46.883 --> 36:48.802
Look, love...

36:49.963 --> 36:52.403
..we just want to find out
who killed Dennis.

36:52.443 --> 36:55.202
Isn't that what you want?
Yes, of course.

36:55.242 --> 36:56.483
Good.

36:57.523 --> 37:01.242
So, who was selling the prescription
drugs, you or Dennis?

37:03.483 --> 37:05.122
Or both of you?

37:05.162 --> 37:07.923
I didn't want to ask my dad
for more money,

37:07.963 --> 37:11.162
and I promised I wouldn't take out
a hefty student loan.

37:11.202 --> 37:12.963
Oh, so, it was just you
who was selling.

37:13.003 --> 37:14.762
It was just the odd one
here and there.

37:14.802 --> 37:16.403
But then it snowballed.

37:17.403 --> 37:19.363
I thought you were going
to search my room in uni.

37:19.403 --> 37:22.043
I panicked and I brought them home.
But I couldn't keep them here.

37:22.083 --> 37:23.802
So, are you telling me

37:23.842 --> 37:27.083
Liam was trying to plant those drugs
in Dennis' flat?

37:27.122 --> 37:28.682
Yes.

37:29.842 --> 37:31.242
I know...

37:31.282 --> 37:33.403
I know it was wrong.

37:33.443 --> 37:35.563
Well, there's an understatement.

37:37.842 --> 37:39.682
Where are you getting
these pills from?

37:39.722 --> 37:41.282
A woman.

37:41.322 --> 37:43.963
A woman...
Dennis never even met her.

37:44.003 --> 37:46.923
Honestly, he had nothing to do
with that side of things.

37:48.403 --> 37:52.162
But something did happen
a few weeks back.

37:52.202 --> 37:53.842
What?

37:53.883 --> 37:55.322
A girl I didn't know,

37:55.363 --> 37:57.322
I sold her a couple of pills

37:57.363 --> 37:59.363
and I told her
not to take them together.

37:59.403 --> 38:00.963
But she took them both.

38:01.003 --> 38:03.003
What happened?
She ended up in A&E.

38:03.043 --> 38:04.923
I called Dennis.

38:04.963 --> 38:07.083
And he came over and stayed with me.

38:07.122 --> 38:10.083
The girl was fine. But the next day,
her boyfriend was going round

38:10.122 --> 38:13.003
trying to find out
where she got the pills from.

38:13.043 --> 38:15.202
I found out later
he'd not long been out of prison.

38:17.003 --> 38:18.162
Hm...

38:23.523 --> 38:25.403
We're going to need names, love.

38:38.563 --> 38:41.682
It's a posh menu, isn't it?
It's student loans.

38:41.722 --> 38:45.923
I thought students lived on beans
out of the tin and packet noodles.

38:45.963 --> 38:48.802
No, that's just you, ma'am.
Hiya. Just find a table,

38:48.842 --> 38:51.523
then give your number in at the bar
with your order.

38:51.563 --> 38:54.122
Actually, we're looking for
Liza Conney. She works here.

38:54.162 --> 38:56.563
Yeah, she's in the kitchen.
Shall I give her a shout for you?

38:56.603 --> 38:58.322
Please.

38:58.363 --> 38:59.842
What's a bruschetta?

39:02.322 --> 39:04.963
Look, it was nothing.
I was out the next morning.

39:05.003 --> 39:07.242
Well, your boyfriend
didn't think it was nothing.

39:07.282 --> 39:09.443
He went looking
for whoever gave you those drugs.

39:09.483 --> 39:11.043
Look, Michael didn't go looking.

39:11.083 --> 39:13.682
He asked around and we happened
to see them the next morning.

39:13.722 --> 39:16.242
Them? Who's them?
Well, Phoebe and her boyfriend.

39:16.282 --> 39:18.282
Is this the fella
that you saw with Phoebe?

39:20.523 --> 39:21.642
Yeah.

39:21.682 --> 39:24.162
Look, are they in trouble?
Is she OK?

39:24.202 --> 39:27.202
Phoebe's all right.
Ah, but this fella...

39:27.242 --> 39:28.883
..Dennis Bayliss...

39:28.923 --> 39:32.722
..he was found dead in the early
hours of yesterday morning.

39:33.722 --> 39:35.883
What?
So, I need you to tell me

39:35.923 --> 39:38.162
what happened when you came out
of the hospital.

39:38.202 --> 39:41.282
Look, Mike picked me up from A&E
and drove me back to my dorm.

39:41.322 --> 39:44.403
I fell asleep for a bit
and when I woke up, he was gone.

39:44.443 --> 39:46.403
I went down to the kitchen
to look for him

39:46.443 --> 39:49.083
and there he was
with Phoebe and Dennis.

39:49.122 --> 39:52.003
Bit of a bully, is he,
your boyfriend?

39:52.043 --> 39:53.483
No.

39:53.523 --> 39:56.003
So, he's never been in trouble
with the police, hm?

39:57.242 --> 39:59.162
He was released from Eaton Grange
in March.

39:59.202 --> 40:01.802
Look, he's completely started over.

40:01.842 --> 40:05.122
Just ask his probation officer!  We
will, love. You can bank on that.

40:05.162 --> 40:07.322
Look, he just hates drugs.

40:07.363 --> 40:09.642
Did Michael and Dennis
have a physical altercation?

40:09.682 --> 40:10.802
No.

40:10.842 --> 40:12.003
Well, not really.

40:12.043 --> 40:13.842
Well, either they did or they didn't.

40:13.883 --> 40:15.563
It was a scuffle, not a fight.

40:16.802 --> 40:19.762
Do you see your boyfriend
every weekend?

40:19.802 --> 40:21.722
Yeah.
Hm?

40:21.762 --> 40:23.282
How about this weekend?

40:23.322 --> 40:25.483
Did you see him on Saturday night?

40:26.483 --> 40:28.642
No.
No? So, where was he?

40:28.682 --> 40:30.523
He was meant to meet me from work,
but...

40:30.563 --> 40:32.043
But what?

40:32.083 --> 40:34.242
He didn't turn up.

41:07.856 --> 41:10.016
STANHOPE:
I'll ask you once again, Michael.

41:10.056 --> 41:12.336
Where were you on Saturday night?

41:12.376 --> 41:15.817
With mates.  Even though you had
an appointment with your girlfriend?

41:15.856 --> 41:18.297
I lost track of time
and my phone died.

41:18.336 --> 41:19.737
Mm.

41:19.777 --> 41:22.617
Now, do you know this fella,
Dennis Bayliss?

41:24.297 --> 41:25.657
Yes.

41:25.697 --> 41:28.777
Well, I'm conducting
the investigation into his murder.

41:28.817 --> 41:31.217
So, I need you to take me through

41:31.257 --> 41:33.097
what happened
the first time you met him,

41:33.137 --> 41:37.697
where the meeting took place
and what were the circumstances.

41:37.737 --> 41:40.336
The first and only time I met him

41:40.376 --> 41:42.297
was at my girlfriend's
halls of residence

41:42.336 --> 41:44.217
at Northumberland University.

41:44.257 --> 41:46.456
And what happened
during that meeting?

41:46.496 --> 41:48.217
We spoke.

41:48.257 --> 41:50.097
About what specifically?

41:50.137 --> 41:52.336
You know what
or I wouldn't be sat here, would I?

41:52.376 --> 41:56.177
I believe you confronted him about
supplying your girlfriend with drugs.

41:56.217 --> 41:58.177
Isn't that right?

41:58.217 --> 42:00.896
I asked him where he got them from.

42:02.137 --> 42:04.137
Is that a crime?

42:05.217 --> 42:07.177
I believe you're anti-drugs.

42:07.217 --> 42:09.097
Absolutely.
Mm.

42:09.137 --> 42:10.617
I've seen the chaos they cause.

42:10.657 --> 42:13.336
Is that why you lost your rag
with Dennis?

42:13.376 --> 42:14.856
He lost it with me.

42:18.217 --> 42:22.416
He needed to know how dangerous
all this prescription crap is.

42:22.456 --> 42:26.056
Oh, so, what, you didn't like the way
he received your drugs advice?

42:26.097 --> 42:28.856
I'm used to stroppy kids
thinking they know everything.

42:28.896 --> 42:30.217
Yeah.

42:30.257 --> 42:33.217
I asked him if he knew what he was
selling was safe. He got defensive.

42:33.257 --> 42:35.936
Oh, is that when
the scuffle broke out?

42:35.976 --> 42:38.137
He tried to throw a punch
and I restrained him.

42:38.177 --> 42:40.376
And then what,
you just walked off, did you?

42:41.376 --> 42:43.856
He got on the phone to his mate
to come and pick him up.

42:43.896 --> 42:45.817
Did you see this mate?

42:45.856 --> 42:47.257
Nope.

42:47.297 --> 42:48.976
Nah, of course you didn't.

42:51.456 --> 42:53.137
I did see his car, though.

42:56.376 --> 42:58.056
Ma'am, I've tracked it.

42:58.097 --> 43:00.817
The car is registered
to a Jassi Deol, aged 50.

43:00.856 --> 43:03.617
She's confirmed that her son Vinay
often drives the car.

43:03.657 --> 43:05.976
Isn't he our Search Angel?
Yeah, he is.

43:06.016 --> 43:07.577
But she can't remember exactly when.

43:07.617 --> 43:10.336
Right, have you got an address?
Grace Drive, Swanside.

43:10.376 --> 43:12.536
Right, come on.
Oh, he's not at home.

43:12.577 --> 43:15.777
But she said he might be at
The Asholm Museum, where he works.

43:15.817 --> 43:18.297
Good work, Jac.
Mm, gold star for you.

43:23.697 --> 43:25.896
STANHOPE:
So, how close were you?

43:25.936 --> 43:29.137
One week, we'd see each other loads.
The next, I wouldn't hear from him.

43:29.177 --> 43:31.376
Usually when I'd said something
he didn't like.

43:31.416 --> 43:32.896
Like what?

43:32.936 --> 43:34.777
Something to do with his dad.

43:34.817 --> 43:36.056
He'd ask for my advice.

43:36.097 --> 43:38.657
But if it wasn't what he wanted
to hear, he'd be off.

43:38.697 --> 43:41.856
So when Dennis contacted the Walkens,

43:41.896 --> 43:45.376
was that the first the family
knew of him? So they said.

43:45.416 --> 43:49.137
And how would you say it was going
between him and his dad?

43:49.177 --> 43:52.456
It definitely wasn't working out
the way he'd hoped it would.

43:52.496 --> 43:53.657
If it wasn't for Mrs Walken,

43:53.697 --> 43:56.016
I don't think Thomas would've
had anything to do with him.

43:56.056 --> 43:58.856
She's the one who made
all the effort, not him.

44:00.217 --> 44:03.177
Do you think the father
could have been perhaps...

44:03.217 --> 44:04.777
..overwhelmed?

44:04.817 --> 44:08.376
You have to let the initial shock
settle and see what emerges.

44:08.416 --> 44:10.297
That sounds sensible.

44:10.336 --> 44:13.016
Except, sensible is the last thing
you feel in the circumstances.

44:15.177 --> 44:18.257
What can you tell us about
his family tree? Anything.

44:18.297 --> 44:20.577
I helped him build it.
Ah, good.

44:20.617 --> 44:24.817
Now, when did he first contact
his birth father, Thomas Walken?

44:24.856 --> 44:27.976
Beginning of the year. But he
didn't meet him until a while later.

44:28.016 --> 44:30.416
Why not?
Thomas wanted to do more tests.

44:30.456 --> 44:31.936
Sibling tests, blood tests.

44:31.976 --> 44:33.336
Any possible test.

44:33.376 --> 44:34.697
Hm.

44:34.737 --> 44:38.737
So, who was the initial contact,
then, off the database?

44:38.777 --> 44:40.177
His half-brother.

44:40.217 --> 44:41.777
David Walken?

44:41.817 --> 44:43.217
Or Joshua?

44:43.257 --> 44:45.257
Yeah, Joshua.

44:45.297 --> 44:48.456
It was a while before they met,
though, around January.

44:48.496 --> 44:50.097
Why was that?

44:50.137 --> 44:53.777
Not everyone on the DNA database
makes their personal details public.

44:53.817 --> 44:56.097
So, there was no name?
No, nothing.

44:56.137 --> 44:58.137
Then, one day, there it was.

44:58.177 --> 45:00.697
Joshua had made himself visible
and Dennis contacted him.

45:02.016 --> 45:04.336
So how did he react, Joshua?

45:04.376 --> 45:06.257
He couldn't wait to meet him.

45:06.297 --> 45:08.177
He flew over almost straight away.

45:08.217 --> 45:09.856
But all very much on the quiet.

45:09.896 --> 45:11.737
Why?
Something to do with Josh

45:11.777 --> 45:13.976
not wanting his family
to know he was here.

45:14.976 --> 45:16.257
Right.

45:18.177 --> 45:22.936
So, Dennis made contact
with the estranged son Joshua Walken

45:22.976 --> 45:25.097
way before the rest of the family.

45:25.137 --> 45:27.056
But as far as any of them
are concerned,

45:27.097 --> 45:28.777
Dennis and Joshua had never met.

45:28.817 --> 45:31.097
Do you think the Walkens are lying?
Well, someone is.

45:31.137 --> 45:32.137
Huh.

45:33.297 --> 45:35.416
Now, then, these flights...

45:36.336 --> 45:39.177
Joshua's first flight
was in December.

45:39.217 --> 45:42.257
Josh and Dennis didn't meet
until January.  Yeah, that's right.

45:42.297 --> 45:45.737
From January to March,
he came over every two weeks

45:45.777 --> 45:47.936
for two or three days.
All from Stockholm.

45:47.976 --> 45:51.817
And then, up until last month,
it was every four weeks.

45:51.856 --> 45:53.376
Same route.

45:53.416 --> 45:55.777
Those dates seem very specific.
Business meetings?

45:55.817 --> 45:57.496
A project in the UK?

45:57.536 --> 46:00.137
A long-distance relationship?
Ah, he's married.

46:00.177 --> 46:01.896
So...?

46:01.936 --> 46:04.056
Now, this first flight in December,

46:04.097 --> 46:06.217
that wasn't direct from Stockholm.

46:06.257 --> 46:07.976
That was via Amsterdam.

46:09.056 --> 46:10.416
Now, why would he do that?

46:11.536 --> 46:13.056
Because it was an emergency?

46:16.496 --> 46:19.177
How often would you go
for chemotherapy?

46:19.217 --> 46:20.896
Depends on the diagnosis.

46:20.936 --> 46:22.777
Every two weeks, initially.

46:22.817 --> 46:24.617
Then every four weeks, maybe.

46:24.657 --> 46:28.697
And what was the first thing
we heard from Julia Walken?

46:28.737 --> 46:30.936
She thought it was one of her boys
who'd been pulled out.

46:30.976 --> 46:32.856
Exactly.

46:32.896 --> 46:34.496
One of her boys.

46:44.817 --> 46:46.617
Hey, thanks for coming, love.

46:46.657 --> 46:48.496
Oooh...
Here.

46:49.536 --> 46:50.896
Here, get that down you.

46:50.936 --> 46:52.336
I took a punt.

46:52.376 --> 46:53.777
Milk, no sugar.

46:53.817 --> 46:55.177
Perfect.
Thank you.

46:55.217 --> 46:57.617
Of course, I could have come to you,
love, but, erm...

46:57.657 --> 46:59.936
Oh, I'm glad to get out,
to be honest.

47:00.976 --> 47:02.536
Now, I'm assuming...

47:03.817 --> 47:08.016
..your husband doesn't know about
Joshua's trips over to see you.

47:11.137 --> 47:13.016
As soon as I got the diagnosis,

47:13.056 --> 47:15.536
me and Joshua
put everything behind us.

47:17.336 --> 47:19.177
I should never have lost contact.

47:19.217 --> 47:20.257
Mm.

47:20.297 --> 47:22.817
And he comes over
to accompany you to the hospital.

47:22.856 --> 47:24.376
Am I right?

47:24.416 --> 47:27.137
Thomas isn't great with all that.

47:27.177 --> 47:28.896
It suits him not to come.

47:30.016 --> 47:31.817
It suits all of us.

47:33.217 --> 47:36.336
Were you aware that Joshua
was meeting up with Dennis?

47:37.777 --> 47:39.056
Yeah.

47:40.376 --> 47:42.137
How about your husband and David?

47:42.177 --> 47:43.896
Did they know?
No.

47:45.177 --> 47:46.896
So when did you find out?

47:48.137 --> 47:50.777
Josh told me
as soon as Dennis made contact.

47:50.817 --> 47:52.217
And when was that?

47:52.257 --> 47:54.257
Beginning of the year.

47:54.297 --> 47:56.496
Oh, I felt for the lad.

47:56.536 --> 47:58.336
He was such a sweet boy.

47:59.456 --> 48:02.737
He just wanted to get to know
his father. Naturally.

48:02.777 --> 48:05.496
But Thomas wasn't keen?

48:05.536 --> 48:08.577
He needed more time.
He would have come round.

48:08.617 --> 48:11.737
Was Joshua in the country
on Saturday night?

48:11.777 --> 48:13.137
No.

48:14.936 --> 48:16.536
But he was here on Friday night.

48:18.336 --> 48:20.737
I had the crazy idea
of inviting him to our party.

48:22.577 --> 48:24.336
To make peace, but...

48:25.376 --> 48:26.817
..it was never going to happen.

48:26.856 --> 48:29.137
He left me a message
on the Saturday afternoon

48:29.177 --> 48:32.297
saying he couldn't go through with
it and was flying back again.

48:32.336 --> 48:33.336
Hm.

48:34.737 --> 48:37.496
Where does Joshua stay
when he comes over?

48:37.536 --> 48:40.016
Well, this last time,
he stayed at my cottage.

48:41.297 --> 48:42.817
You have a cottage?

48:42.856 --> 48:44.817
Just off the estate.

48:44.856 --> 48:46.577
Oh, it's nothing grand.

48:46.617 --> 48:48.097
Just my little project.

48:50.737 --> 48:52.496
My quiet place.

48:52.536 --> 48:53.856
Oh...

48:53.896 --> 48:55.336
That's nice.

49:07.137 --> 49:08.577
It's all locked up.

49:08.617 --> 49:12.376
Dennis could have come up here after
the party looking for his brother.

49:12.416 --> 49:15.336
We've combed through the CCTV at the
house. He didn't leave the estate.

49:15.376 --> 49:17.777
Yeah, well,
get Jac to go through it again.

49:17.817 --> 49:19.536
Kenny, yes?

49:19.577 --> 49:21.737
We found Dennis Bayliss' phone
at the salmon farm.

49:21.777 --> 49:23.177
Really?
Aye.

49:23.217 --> 49:24.657
We'll meet you down there.
What?

49:24.697 --> 49:27.577
Dennis' phone has been found
at the Walken Estate.

49:27.617 --> 49:30.336
Where abouts?
By the salmon farm.

49:30.376 --> 49:33.577
Which he absolutely
could not have accessed.

49:34.856 --> 49:36.177
Come on.

49:59.215 --> 50:01.336
Ma'am, we found the phone up there.

50:01.376 --> 50:04.175
The screen's smashed,
it's dead, obviously.

50:04.215 --> 50:06.095
But I'll get it recharged
and analysed.

50:06.135 --> 50:07.655
So, there's no doubt
he was down here?

50:07.695 --> 50:11.496
Well, the positioning means he
could have thrown it over the gate.

50:11.536 --> 50:14.376
Who told us this place was locked
and secure overnight?

50:14.416 --> 50:15.936
Everyone did, ma'am.

50:15.976 --> 50:18.976
Right, get on to Mark and Jac.
I want Forensics down here.

50:19.016 --> 50:22.295
Then get on to Malcolm. Tell him
we've got our possible crime scene.

50:22.336 --> 50:24.175
See if he can throw anything else up.

50:24.215 --> 50:26.496
Meanwhile,
this entire place is on lockdown.

50:26.536 --> 50:27.655
Understood, ma'am.

50:29.295 --> 50:30.695
JOE BARRY: I can't understand it.

50:30.735 --> 50:31.816
HE SNIFFS

50:31.856 --> 50:33.816
I mean, I personally locked up
on Saturday,

50:33.856 --> 50:35.816
so I know the place
was definitely secure.

50:35.856 --> 50:37.816
Well, that is strange.

50:37.856 --> 50:40.416
I mean, could there have been
a mistake, do you think?

50:40.456 --> 50:43.215
Maybe somebody else
came down here after you.

50:43.255 --> 50:44.695
I can't see how.

50:46.735 --> 50:48.295
Well...

50:48.336 --> 50:51.655
..that's some security system
you've got out here.

50:51.695 --> 50:54.856
I mean, is it just bad luck
it hasn't picked up the poachers?

50:54.896 --> 50:56.416
Poachers?

50:56.456 --> 50:58.856
Aye. David said you've got a problem
with poaching.

50:58.896 --> 51:00.775
Just minor losses.

51:00.816 --> 51:02.416
Yeah, that's what he said.

51:03.536 --> 51:07.016
So have you checked there
was nothing untoward on Saturday?

51:07.056 --> 51:09.336
Well, to be honest,
it's been that mad around here,

51:09.376 --> 51:11.295
I haven't had a chance
to sit down with David

51:11.336 --> 51:12.896
and go through the weekly stocks.

51:12.936 --> 51:16.175
So the CCTV
hasn't been gone through yet?

51:16.215 --> 51:17.816
Well, no.

51:17.856 --> 51:19.816
Well, do you mind if I have a look?

51:19.856 --> 51:21.976
Right, here we go...

51:23.735 --> 51:26.655
Sorry about this. It just takes
a little time loading up.

51:26.695 --> 51:28.655
Oh, no problem.

51:29.976 --> 51:31.615
Give it a minute...

51:33.056 --> 51:36.615
Good.
This is from Saturday night at 9:38.

51:36.655 --> 51:37.936
Right.

51:37.976 --> 51:41.536
So, can you fast-forward
to 1:00am onwards?

51:41.575 --> 51:44.976
Aye.
It'll just take me a wee while.

51:45.016 --> 51:47.376
It's all right, no rush.

51:49.295 --> 51:51.416
Oh, yeah, it's flying through now.

51:53.816 --> 51:54.976
Come on...

51:56.615 --> 51:58.775
What's happening?
Sorry.

51:58.816 --> 52:00.496
I'll go back...

52:00.536 --> 52:02.056
..and try again.

52:02.095 --> 52:04.056
Come on...

52:06.095 --> 52:07.536
Come on...

52:07.575 --> 52:08.615
Oh!

52:08.655 --> 52:10.175
What's happened?

52:10.215 --> 52:12.416
Looks like there was
a camera outage.  Brilliant!

52:12.456 --> 52:15.456
Does it start again?
I've got nothing after 11:55.

52:15.496 --> 52:17.496
I'll have to check the computer.

52:17.536 --> 52:20.416
Well, I'm going to need
your hard drive. Aye, sure.

52:20.456 --> 52:23.095
I mean, anything I can do.
Here, finish that.

52:28.896 --> 52:31.095
DAVID: You think he was assaulted
down there?

52:31.135 --> 52:34.536
Possibly. We've yet to find any
evidence of him leaving the estate,

52:34.575 --> 52:36.135
so it makes sense.

52:38.135 --> 52:41.976
Now, do you have any idea
of why he might have gone down there?

52:43.056 --> 52:45.336
None whatsoever.
Why would we?

52:46.896 --> 52:49.575
Do you have any suspicions at all
about any of the staff,

52:49.615 --> 52:51.215
regarding the poaching?

52:52.255 --> 52:53.655
What poaching?

52:55.896 --> 52:58.056
What poaching?
I was dealing with it.

52:58.095 --> 53:00.376
I didn't want to bother you.
Bother me?

53:00.416 --> 53:02.215
It's my business!

53:02.255 --> 53:05.416
Did you report it?
Joe said he was looking into it.

53:05.456 --> 53:07.775
Joe?
You left it to Joe?

53:07.816 --> 53:10.336
I was waiting.
How do you know it wasn't Dennis?

53:11.775 --> 53:13.536
Dad...
Dad, what?

53:13.575 --> 53:15.735
We don't know what the hell
he was up to.

53:15.775 --> 53:18.215
It sounds like
you haven't got a clue, either.

53:19.735 --> 53:22.336
So, you've no suspicions of Dennis
at all,

53:22.376 --> 53:24.976
in connection with the poaching?
No.

53:25.016 --> 53:26.456
You hardly knew him!

53:28.896 --> 53:30.016
Look...

53:31.016 --> 53:32.416
I'm not saying he was involved.

53:32.456 --> 53:35.376
He was my son. I cared about him.
Of course I did.

53:35.416 --> 53:37.056
But did I know him?

53:38.056 --> 53:39.215
Did you know him?

53:39.255 --> 53:41.016
Did he know us?

53:41.056 --> 53:44.536
Did we all have some sort
of magical connection when we met?

53:44.575 --> 53:46.095
No!

53:46.135 --> 53:47.655
We did not!

53:54.336 --> 53:56.775
HEALY: So, the son doesn't want
to bother his own father

53:56.816 --> 53:59.496
about the family business.
Ah, the man's a bully.

53:59.536 --> 54:00.936
David's scared of him.

54:00.976 --> 54:03.536
Do we really think Dennis
is connected to the poaching?

54:03.575 --> 54:04.816
Look...

54:05.856 --> 54:09.536
..he was desperate to have
a relationship with his father, hm?

54:09.575 --> 54:11.936
He felt scorned, rejected, so...

54:12.936 --> 54:14.016
..who knows?

54:21.575 --> 54:24.695
Now, this blackout
lasted until Sunday morning.

54:24.735 --> 54:27.496
Every camera
in the business area cut out.

54:27.536 --> 54:29.496
Now, is that a coincidence or what?

54:29.536 --> 54:30.735
Yeah.

54:30.775 --> 54:33.416
Now, how are we doing
with the employee background checks?

54:33.456 --> 54:35.615
Anything popped up?
Er, almost complete.

54:35.655 --> 54:37.816
There's a couple of temps
I can't get backgrounds on,

54:37.856 --> 54:38.976
but I'm working on it.

54:39.016 --> 54:42.615
Jac, apply to get
the Walkens' bank records.

54:42.655 --> 54:44.135
Business and private.

54:44.175 --> 54:46.615
See what that pulls up.
Ma'am.

54:46.655 --> 54:50.016
Now, have we had that hard drive
from the fish farm yet?

54:50.056 --> 54:53.016
PHONE RINGS
Yeah. Tech are working on it now.

54:53.056 --> 54:54.496
Malcolm.

54:56.856 --> 54:59.295
DCI Stanhope, you're getting faster.

54:59.336 --> 55:00.976
So, what have you got?

55:01.016 --> 55:04.695
Right, well, following in-depth
analysis on Dennis' clothes,

55:04.735 --> 55:06.976
we found traces of, erm...

55:07.016 --> 55:09.816
Do you want to have a guess?
No, I don't. Get on with it.

55:09.856 --> 55:12.695
Well, all right, grease.

55:14.016 --> 55:16.175
What sort of grease?
Well, I say grease.

55:16.215 --> 55:20.056
It is actually a calcium sulfonate
complex thickener,

55:20.095 --> 55:23.336
which is used in high-performance
marine products.

55:23.376 --> 55:24.775
Aye, used on boats.

55:24.816 --> 55:27.536
So, it looks like your boy
was taken out onto the water.

55:27.575 --> 55:29.295
Where on his clothes was it?

55:29.336 --> 55:32.056
There was a little bit
on the bottom of the legs.

55:32.095 --> 55:35.615
Interestingly, there were no traces
of it on his back, which means...

55:35.655 --> 55:39.655
Which means he came into contact
with it before he died.

55:39.695 --> 55:43.376
Because, if he was horizontal,
there'd be traces all over him.

55:43.416 --> 55:45.416
You really should do this
professionally.

55:45.456 --> 55:47.295
Well, so should you, pet.

55:50.735 --> 55:52.856
Right, now, listen up, everyone.

55:52.896 --> 55:55.175
He was on a boat before he died.

55:55.215 --> 55:57.336
So, he was involved with poaching.

55:57.376 --> 55:59.175
Yeah, well,
we'll have to consider it.

55:59.215 --> 56:02.655
The question is,
did he get on there voluntarily?

56:02.695 --> 56:05.135
Or maybe he was forced or coerced.

56:05.175 --> 56:07.095
That would account for the bruises.

56:07.135 --> 56:08.896
There's a lot of boats down there,
ma'am.

56:08.936 --> 56:11.575
Yeah, and I want Forensics
on every one of them.

56:11.615 --> 56:14.336
And how are we doing
with the lad's mobile?

56:14.376 --> 56:16.976
No joy yet.
They'll need more time, ma'am.

56:17.016 --> 56:19.456
No, that's all right,
we're making progress.

56:19.496 --> 56:21.896
Ma'am, you're going to want
to see this.

56:21.936 --> 56:25.856
The salmon farm cameras
were shut down at 23:54.

56:25.896 --> 56:28.416
But a few minutes before that,
at 23:51,

56:28.456 --> 56:30.816
there was a file deleted manually.
Deleted?

56:30.856 --> 56:33.575
Yeah. But we've managed to
retrieve it from the hard drive.

56:33.615 --> 56:37.295
So, here's the main gates
to the salmon farm at 23:35.

56:37.336 --> 56:41.615
And then again ten minutes later
at 23:45.

56:46.575 --> 56:48.856
Can you zoom in on that?
Yeah.

56:52.376 --> 56:57.135
So, what's he doing down there
at that time of night?

57:04.775 --> 57:06.615
Are you going somewhere, Joe?

57:07.655 --> 57:09.215
Hm?

57:20.494 --> 57:23.175
Ma'am, there's a Rob Bayliss here
to see you.

57:31.454 --> 57:33.095
Mr Bayliss.

57:33.135 --> 57:34.735
Who was that?

57:34.775 --> 57:36.575
Don't go there, love.

57:36.615 --> 57:38.894
Any developments,
you'll be the first to know.

57:38.934 --> 57:40.494
You have my word on that.

57:48.135 --> 57:49.894
How are you both?

57:51.095 --> 57:52.934
Ah, that's a stupid question.

57:55.575 --> 57:57.974
Look, I'm going to get someone
to take you home, pet.

57:58.014 --> 57:59.615
You really shouldn't be here.

58:03.414 --> 58:05.095
They won't be a minute.

58:11.494 --> 58:14.814
Now, then, what were you doing
in the Walkens' yard

58:14.854 --> 58:17.814
on Saturday night after hours?

58:19.135 --> 58:20.814
No comment.

58:20.854 --> 58:25.055
I believe you were shutting down
the security cameras.

58:25.095 --> 58:27.255
No comment.  Is that how
the poaching worked, you get paid

58:27.295 --> 58:30.055
to make sure the cameras are down
while they get on with it?

58:30.095 --> 58:33.374
Now, according to pretty much
every witness statement

58:33.414 --> 58:35.854
received from the farm,

58:35.894 --> 58:38.175
you are in charge of security.

58:38.215 --> 58:40.934
I mean, some would say
you are a control freak

58:40.974 --> 58:43.615
because you refuse
to employ a nightwatchman

58:43.655 --> 58:45.655
because you like to be
the only key holder,

58:45.695 --> 58:47.615
aside from Thomas
and David Walken.

58:47.655 --> 58:49.215
Does that sound accurate?

58:49.255 --> 58:51.575
I just like things
the way I like them.

58:51.615 --> 58:53.775
But what puzzles me
is why you'd want

58:53.814 --> 58:56.295
all that extra work
and responsibility,

58:56.334 --> 59:00.655
when you can pay some fella minimum
wage to sit in a hut all night.

59:04.014 --> 59:06.454
Is it because you're on the fiddle?

59:06.494 --> 59:09.695
Is that why
there are no police reports logged?

59:09.735 --> 59:14.055
And why did we find Dennis' mobile
in that yard?

59:14.095 --> 59:17.334
The yard locked by you.

59:18.374 --> 59:20.095
I don't know.

59:21.695 --> 59:24.655
Well, let's talk security systems.

59:24.695 --> 59:26.095
Hey...

59:26.135 --> 59:27.934
And that was a cracking performance

59:27.974 --> 59:30.135
you gave in the security office,
by the way.

59:30.175 --> 59:31.655
I told you, didn't I?
Mm.

59:31.695 --> 59:32.934
Excellent work.

59:32.974 --> 59:36.055
We've had a closer look at the
system installed at the Walkens',

59:36.095 --> 59:37.775
which is now working perfectly,

59:37.814 --> 59:39.615
but someone must have shut it off.

59:45.534 --> 59:47.334
Care to explain?

59:47.374 --> 59:49.175
I'm not an expert.

59:49.215 --> 59:51.014
Oh, are you not?

59:52.095 --> 59:53.655
Hm...

59:55.814 --> 59:57.735
Is that your signature?

59:59.655 --> 01:00:01.175
Yes?

01:00:01.215 --> 01:00:02.334
Yes.

01:00:02.374 --> 01:00:04.735
Well, you purchased the system.

01:00:04.775 --> 01:00:07.655
You oversaw the installation.

01:00:07.695 --> 01:00:12.095
And you run and manage
the whole security network.

01:00:12.135 --> 01:00:14.414
Yeah, well, all security systems
have their flaws.

01:00:14.454 --> 01:00:17.534
No, I'm not talking about technology,
love. I'm talking about you.

01:00:17.575 --> 01:00:20.655
And I have to tell you,
I'm beginning to lose my patience.

01:00:20.695 --> 01:00:22.454
We have reason to believe

01:00:22.494 --> 01:00:25.775
that you were the last person
to see Dennis Bayliss alive.

01:00:25.814 --> 01:00:30.135
So I need you to tell me
what were you doing in that yard

01:00:30.175 --> 01:00:32.135
and why you lied.

01:00:41.854 --> 01:00:45.055
Saturday just seemed the perfect
opportunity, what with...

01:00:45.095 --> 01:00:47.854
..the party and everybody
up at the house drinking.

01:00:47.894 --> 01:00:50.974
So you are confirming
you were aware of criminal activity

01:00:51.014 --> 01:00:53.295
on the Walkens' farm
on Saturday night?

01:00:53.334 --> 01:00:54.374
Yes.

01:00:55.374 --> 01:00:58.255
And how was the deceased,
Dennis Bayliss, involved?

01:00:58.295 --> 01:01:00.014
Well, he wasn't.

01:01:00.055 --> 01:01:02.295
SHE SCOFFS
I swear.

01:01:02.334 --> 01:01:06.334
Look, forgive me if I don't
automatically believe you, love.

01:01:06.374 --> 01:01:11.295
Now, were you present throughout
this theft of the Walkens' property?

01:01:11.334 --> 01:01:13.055
Well, no.

01:01:13.095 --> 01:01:15.414
No, I mean, all the poaching
takes place out on the water.

01:01:15.454 --> 01:01:17.374
We know Dennis was on a boat.

01:01:17.414 --> 01:01:18.974
A boat?

01:01:19.014 --> 01:01:21.814
Was he involved?

01:01:22.854 --> 01:01:23.974
No!

01:01:24.014 --> 01:01:25.414
No, definitely not.

01:01:26.735 --> 01:01:29.494
Could he have disturbed
the poachers?

01:01:29.534 --> 01:01:31.974
I can't see how.
I mean...

01:01:32.014 --> 01:01:33.414
No.

01:01:33.454 --> 01:01:35.095
No, he couldn't have.

01:01:35.135 --> 01:01:36.534
I need names.

01:01:36.575 --> 01:01:37.814
Places.

01:01:37.854 --> 01:01:39.735
Times.
And I want them now.

01:01:39.775 --> 01:01:40.775
Look...

01:01:42.095 --> 01:01:43.735
What?

01:01:44.854 --> 01:01:46.854
When I was down there,
sorting the security...

01:01:46.894 --> 01:01:48.374
Shutting it down.

01:01:48.414 --> 01:01:51.775
Yeah, well, I noticed
that one of the boats was missing.

01:01:51.814 --> 01:01:53.295
One of the farm boats.

01:01:53.334 --> 01:01:55.135
David had taken
one of the farm boats

01:01:55.175 --> 01:01:56.775
to get himself home that night.

01:01:57.894 --> 01:01:59.295
Did he?

01:02:04.775 --> 01:02:06.934
You were right about that engine,
David.

01:02:08.095 --> 01:02:09.655
The crank won't catch.

01:02:09.695 --> 01:02:11.655
It means the cut-off's not loading.

01:02:11.695 --> 01:02:13.215
See that here?

01:02:13.255 --> 01:02:16.095
The water's damaged the kill switch,
shorting the engine.

01:02:16.135 --> 01:02:18.534
You're going to have to leave that,
David.

01:02:20.575 --> 01:02:22.494
I need you to come with me, love.

01:02:27.095 --> 01:02:30.695
All the poachers have got alibis.
They were tucked up in bed by 1:30.

01:02:30.735 --> 01:02:32.175
No idea who Dennis was.

01:02:32.215 --> 01:02:34.374
We've gone through
the Walkens' bank statements.

01:02:34.414 --> 01:02:36.575
Something's come up
from David's personal account.

01:02:36.615 --> 01:02:40.894
What?
A payment of £1,000 to Vinay Deol.

01:02:42.615 --> 01:02:44.334
Thank, Jac
And something else.

01:02:44.374 --> 01:02:46.334
He's left-handed.

01:02:50.295 --> 01:02:51.735
Evening.

01:03:00.655 --> 01:03:02.854
Why didn't you mention this?

01:03:04.135 --> 01:03:06.934
It was a private arrangement,
I didn't think it was relevant.

01:03:06.974 --> 01:03:09.095
Was he extorting money out of you?

01:03:09.135 --> 01:03:11.255
I don't know what you mean.

01:03:11.295 --> 01:03:13.454
Well, something you wanted
keeping quiet.

01:03:13.494 --> 01:03:15.934
Maybe you've got more siblings
tucked away somewhere.

01:03:15.974 --> 01:03:18.295
I wasn't paying Vinay
to keep quiet about anything.

01:03:18.334 --> 01:03:20.135
I was paying him
to keep an eye on Dennis.

01:03:20.175 --> 01:03:21.974
To spy on him?

01:03:22.014 --> 01:03:24.295
Not spy, just...

01:03:25.295 --> 01:03:27.255
I didn't know
what Dennis' intentions were.

01:03:27.295 --> 01:03:29.454
I didn't know who he was.
I felt...

01:03:29.494 --> 01:03:30.854
..protective.

01:03:30.894 --> 01:03:33.175
Not just of the business,
but of my family.

01:03:33.215 --> 01:03:36.055
The poaching did only start
after he turned up.

01:03:36.095 --> 01:03:37.775
Dad is right about that.

01:03:37.814 --> 01:03:40.175
But I didn't think
he was actually doing it.

01:03:40.215 --> 01:03:43.575
So you did think
he was involved in some way.

01:03:43.615 --> 01:03:45.454
I don't know, I...

01:03:45.494 --> 01:03:48.775
I imagined him being indiscreet
about the estate's security.

01:03:48.814 --> 01:03:50.175
Possibly.

01:03:50.215 --> 01:03:52.494
Tell us about this argument.

01:03:53.454 --> 01:03:54.854
I've told you.

01:03:54.894 --> 01:03:56.494
It was nothing, a few words.

01:03:56.534 --> 01:03:57.575
Initially.

01:03:57.615 --> 01:04:00.735
But I'm wondering
if this argument didn't escalate.

01:04:00.775 --> 01:04:02.095
It didn't.

01:04:02.135 --> 01:04:04.295
Did you confront him
about the poaching?

01:04:04.334 --> 01:04:05.615
No.

01:04:05.655 --> 01:04:08.175
Are you sure about that?
For the purpose of the tape,

01:04:08.215 --> 01:04:10.215
DCI Stanhope is showing Mr Walken

01:04:10.255 --> 01:04:12.854
a photo of Dennis Bayliss'
upper right arm,

01:04:12.894 --> 01:04:16.414
which is full of bruising.  Are you
responsible for these marks?

01:04:16.454 --> 01:04:17.775
No.

01:04:17.814 --> 01:04:19.534
Because we believe they were caused

01:04:19.575 --> 01:04:22.655
by him being grabbed
and pulled and dragged.

01:04:22.695 --> 01:04:25.575
Now, did you do any of that?
No.

01:04:25.615 --> 01:04:28.055
Cos he wouldn't answer your questions
about the poaching

01:04:28.095 --> 01:04:30.255
or he wouldn't leave
when you asked him to.

01:04:30.295 --> 01:04:31.215
No.

01:04:31.255 --> 01:04:33.575
Were you on a boat on Saturday?

01:04:35.175 --> 01:04:36.735
Not after the party had started.

01:04:36.775 --> 01:04:38.735
So you were on a boat.
I use them every day.

01:04:38.775 --> 01:04:40.735
What time?
I don't know, earlier on.

01:04:40.775 --> 01:04:43.735
Was Dennis with you on the boat?
Why would he be?

01:04:43.775 --> 01:04:46.135
We know he was on a boat
with someone. Well, it wasn't me.

01:04:46.175 --> 01:04:47.854
I don't believe you!

01:04:53.014 --> 01:04:54.695
I didn't mean to hurt him.

01:04:56.374 --> 01:04:58.055
Are you telling me...

01:04:58.095 --> 01:05:00.414
..you are responsible...

01:05:00.454 --> 01:05:02.175
..for these injuries?

01:05:02.215 --> 01:05:04.055
It did get physical.

01:05:04.095 --> 01:05:05.255
Briefly.

01:05:06.334 --> 01:05:08.295
He said some stuff, which...

01:05:08.334 --> 01:05:11.215
Well, it was hard to hear.
What stuff?

01:05:13.255 --> 01:05:15.014
It was about Josh.

01:05:15.055 --> 01:05:18.814
To clarify, you're talking about
your brother Joshua Walken.

01:05:18.854 --> 01:05:21.295
I knew that's how Dennis
must have found Dad.

01:05:21.334 --> 01:05:23.934
Via Josh.
There was no other way.

01:05:23.974 --> 01:05:27.374
And you first asked him
on Saturday night.

01:05:27.414 --> 01:05:29.255
It just came out.

01:05:30.334 --> 01:05:33.055
It was building
each time we saw one another.

01:05:33.095 --> 01:05:36.014
Despite what my dad said
about Dennis being a stranger,

01:05:36.055 --> 01:05:37.775
we did have a connection.

01:05:38.974 --> 01:05:40.775
Like me and Josh.

01:05:41.735 --> 01:05:42.934
Do you miss Josh?

01:05:44.095 --> 01:05:46.814
I didn't realise how much
until Dennis appeared.

01:05:48.534 --> 01:05:50.494
So, what happened at this party?

01:05:52.255 --> 01:05:54.215
Dennis was drunk.

01:05:54.255 --> 01:05:56.014
He was all over the place.

01:05:56.055 --> 01:05:57.494
I wasn't too great myself.

01:05:58.615 --> 01:06:01.334
But I said I knew
he was in contact with Josh.

01:06:01.374 --> 01:06:03.695
And he didn't deny it.
It was...

01:06:06.414 --> 01:06:07.814
I'm ashamed.

01:06:09.334 --> 01:06:11.255
Of myself.
It was pathetic.

01:06:11.295 --> 01:06:13.295
We were like little kids.

01:06:13.334 --> 01:06:16.414
Two brothers arguing about
who Josh loved more.

01:06:18.295 --> 01:06:21.414
I grabbed him and told him to get
out. That's when I must have...

01:06:23.055 --> 01:06:26.814
But why would he go down
to the business area of the estate?

01:06:26.854 --> 01:06:29.014
I don't know.
He said he was leaving.

01:06:29.055 --> 01:06:32.934
Well, that's not leaving, is it?
There's no way out from down there.

01:06:32.974 --> 01:06:35.934
There is, if you use the tidal path.
What tidal path?

01:06:35.974 --> 01:06:38.494
At low tide
you can get round to the next cove,

01:06:38.534 --> 01:06:39.814
beyond the estate.

01:06:39.854 --> 01:06:42.735
Now, did Dennis know about
this path?

01:06:42.775 --> 01:06:44.175
I don't know.

01:06:44.215 --> 01:06:45.615
Possibly.

01:07:18.095 --> 01:07:20.655
Well, if he did come this way,

01:07:20.695 --> 01:07:23.135
it would have been pitch-black.

01:07:23.175 --> 01:07:25.974
The lad must have been desperate
to get away.

01:07:29.295 --> 01:07:30.494
Hang on...

01:07:30.534 --> 01:07:33.414
Isn't that where
Joshua Walken stayed?

01:07:33.454 --> 01:07:34.775
It is.

01:07:37.414 --> 01:07:39.575
Get Forensics down here.

01:07:49.135 --> 01:07:51.135
Ma'am, what do you want to do
with David Walken?

01:07:51.175 --> 01:07:53.414
Well, how long have we got?
Another couple of hours.

01:07:53.454 --> 01:07:55.615
Well, keep him.
Fine.

01:07:55.655 --> 01:07:57.055
Ma'am, we've got him.

01:07:57.095 --> 01:07:58.575
He never left the country.

01:07:58.615 --> 01:08:01.374
He's checked into a hotel in Lexford
using his credit card.

01:08:02.854 --> 01:08:03.854
Brilliant.

01:08:40.453 --> 01:08:42.215
Hello, Joshua.

01:08:48.975 --> 01:08:52.533
Did Dennis come to see you at
your mam's cottage on Saturday night?

01:08:52.573 --> 01:08:54.135
I knew.

01:08:54.175 --> 01:08:55.533
What?

01:08:56.533 --> 01:08:58.895
We all always knew.

01:08:58.935 --> 01:09:00.573
About Dennis?

01:09:04.135 --> 01:09:06.095
Before the DNA test?

01:09:06.135 --> 01:09:08.095
That's why I tested.

01:09:08.135 --> 01:09:10.533
You were looking for him.

01:09:10.573 --> 01:09:12.135
Absolutely.

01:09:12.175 --> 01:09:14.493
And I lost my family because of it.

01:09:16.895 --> 01:09:19.055
I thought this kid
deserved to know us.

01:09:20.175 --> 01:09:21.533
How wrong was I?

01:09:21.573 --> 01:09:23.694
Now, just to be clear...

01:09:23.734 --> 01:09:27.734
..you're saying you and your family
have always known about Dennis.

01:09:29.734 --> 01:09:32.734
I was about ten
when the baby arguments started.

01:09:32.774 --> 01:09:34.295
I'd listen at the door.

01:09:34.334 --> 01:09:37.774
Who was this baby? When was it
coming? Didn't Dad want it?

01:09:39.334 --> 01:09:41.935
It was their complete denial
that I'd heard anything about a baby

01:09:41.975 --> 01:09:43.215
that gave it away.

01:09:43.255 --> 01:09:45.895
If they'd bothered to come up
with some vaguely believable story,

01:09:45.935 --> 01:09:47.295
I probably would've bought it.

01:09:51.854 --> 01:09:54.815
I always needed to know
who the baby was.

01:09:54.855 --> 01:09:57.694
Well, if you were so keen
to find him,

01:09:57.734 --> 01:10:02.135
how come it took so long for him to
track you down after the DNA match?

01:10:02.175 --> 01:10:04.334
I'd wanted to know the truth
for so long,

01:10:04.374 --> 01:10:06.055
but when I was faced with it, I...

01:10:07.215 --> 01:10:10.494
I don't know,
I was frightened, I suppose.

01:10:10.534 --> 01:10:14.215
When did Dennis find out
that his dad knew about him?

01:10:15.454 --> 01:10:18.095
When I told him on Saturday.

01:10:19.095 --> 01:10:21.055
What time did Dennis turn up
at the cottage?

01:10:21.095 --> 01:10:22.135
Late.

01:10:22.175 --> 01:10:24.295
Around 2:00.

01:10:24.334 --> 01:10:26.895
And what happened?
He was distraught.

01:10:26.935 --> 01:10:29.815
David had confronted him about me.
He was all mixed up.

01:10:31.015 --> 01:10:32.815
Dad had walked in on them arguing

01:10:32.855 --> 01:10:35.015
and he launched a glass
at poor David.

01:10:35.055 --> 01:10:37.175
The whole thing is a mess.

01:10:38.215 --> 01:10:39.694
He called him...

01:10:39.734 --> 01:10:41.855
..from the cottage before he left.

01:10:41.895 --> 01:10:44.694
I went out after him
to try and stop him.

01:10:44.734 --> 01:10:47.334
The way he spoke to him,
I knew he'd be...

01:10:48.654 --> 01:10:50.454
That he wouldn't have that.

01:10:51.454 --> 01:10:54.135
Not from Dennis.
Not from anyone.

01:10:54.175 --> 01:10:56.095
Now, wait a minute.
Who did he call?

01:10:59.614 --> 01:11:01.414
He called me dad.

01:11:22.263 --> 01:11:23.583
Mr Walken...

01:11:25.104 --> 01:11:26.583
Thomas Walken, I'm arresting you

01:11:26.623 --> 01:11:28.864
on suspicion of the murder
of Dennis Bayliss.

01:11:28.904 --> 01:11:30.503
You do not have to say anything,

01:11:30.543 --> 01:11:33.343
but it may harm your defence if
you do not mention, when questioned,

01:11:33.383 --> 01:11:35.343
something you later rely on
in court.

01:11:35.383 --> 01:11:37.663
Anything you do say
may be given as evidence.

01:11:37.704 --> 01:11:39.303
He hasn't done anything.

01:11:39.343 --> 01:11:40.944
What's happening?

01:11:40.984 --> 01:11:42.503
I'm sorry, love.

01:11:44.024 --> 01:11:45.503
We'll be in touch.

01:11:45.543 --> 01:11:46.663
ENGINE STARTS

01:11:53.303 --> 01:11:55.503
So, you're now saying...

01:11:55.543 --> 01:11:59.784
..you didn't go to bed shortly after
your wife, as previously stated?

01:11:59.824 --> 01:12:01.984
No.
But you were out on the water?

01:12:02.024 --> 01:12:04.184
Correct.
Was Dennis in the boat with you?

01:12:04.223 --> 01:12:05.543
Dennis?
Aye.

01:12:05.583 --> 01:12:06.663
No.

01:12:06.704 --> 01:12:10.503
Oh, so you just went
on this moonlight jaunt alone.

01:12:10.543 --> 01:12:12.463
I wasn't alone.

01:12:12.503 --> 01:12:14.064
Oh, so, who were you with?

01:12:14.104 --> 01:12:15.583
Just an old friend.

01:12:15.623 --> 01:12:16.944
Name?

01:12:18.184 --> 01:12:19.984
Angela Bourne.

01:12:22.543 --> 01:12:23.904
Oh...

01:12:23.944 --> 01:12:25.864
I see.

01:12:25.904 --> 01:12:28.184
And she can vouch for that, can she?

01:12:28.223 --> 01:12:29.423
Yes.

01:12:29.463 --> 01:12:32.263
So you were more concerned
in keeping this cruise

01:12:32.303 --> 01:12:34.024
with your old friend secret

01:12:34.064 --> 01:12:37.904
than in assisting a murder
investigation. Is that right?

01:12:37.944 --> 01:12:39.503
We will be talking to Angela.

01:12:39.543 --> 01:12:41.663
You can be sure of that.

01:12:43.463 --> 01:12:47.904
Now, then, how did you feel
when Dennis marched into your life?

01:12:49.503 --> 01:12:51.704
A kid turns up at your door
and says he's yours...

01:12:52.704 --> 01:12:55.104
..you feel a lot of things.
Tell us more about that.

01:12:55.144 --> 01:12:58.024
Did you feel happy, sad, guilty?

01:12:58.064 --> 01:12:59.383
Guilty?

01:12:59.423 --> 01:13:00.864
For what?

01:13:00.904 --> 01:13:03.144
Angry maybe.

01:13:04.463 --> 01:13:06.024
No.

01:13:06.064 --> 01:13:07.744
Why would I be angry?

01:13:07.784 --> 01:13:09.904
Well, let's see...

01:13:09.944 --> 01:13:11.864
Fear of upsetting your wife.

01:13:11.904 --> 01:13:13.864
Disappointing your sons.

01:13:13.904 --> 01:13:16.543
Harming your reputation,
your life.

01:13:16.583 --> 01:13:18.904
My wife had no problem with Dennis.

01:13:18.944 --> 01:13:20.744
Nor any of the above,

01:13:20.784 --> 01:13:25.423
since the pair of you have known of
his existence for the last 19 years.

01:13:28.423 --> 01:13:32.064
So, how did his turning up
affect your marriage, hm?

01:13:33.383 --> 01:13:35.064
She has cancer.

01:13:36.024 --> 01:13:38.263
She wasn't about to spend
copious amounts of energy

01:13:38.303 --> 01:13:40.784
on a mistake I made 20 years ago.
Mm.

01:13:42.024 --> 01:13:45.423
Remind me when you last saw Joshua.

01:13:46.543 --> 01:13:48.144
Well, I told you.

01:13:48.184 --> 01:13:49.984
Three years ago.

01:13:50.024 --> 01:13:52.623
Did he confront you about
you having another son somewhere?

01:13:52.663 --> 01:13:56.303
These questions are completely...
Pertinent.

01:13:57.343 --> 01:14:00.064
Now, you denying Dennis' existence

01:14:00.104 --> 01:14:04.144
suggests to me
you didn't want the lad in your life.

01:14:04.184 --> 01:14:08.024
And this new caring father act...

01:14:08.064 --> 01:14:09.583
..was simply that.

01:14:13.064 --> 01:14:15.583
Tell us about the last time
you saw Dennis on Saturday.

01:14:16.704 --> 01:14:17.904
I'll tell you.

01:14:17.944 --> 01:14:20.663
You came across David and Dennis
having words

01:14:20.704 --> 01:14:22.623
and you lost your temper.

01:14:22.663 --> 01:14:25.184
I believe you even threw a glass
at David.

01:14:25.223 --> 01:14:26.423
No.

01:14:26.463 --> 01:14:28.744
So did you follow Dennis outside?
No.

01:14:29.744 --> 01:14:32.184
I believe Joshua told Dennis...
Joshua wasn't even there!

01:14:32.223 --> 01:14:34.704
I believe Joshua told Dennis

01:14:34.744 --> 01:14:38.343
that you had indeed known about him
all these years

01:14:38.383 --> 01:14:41.503
and that Dennis phoned you
from your wife's cottage

01:14:41.543 --> 01:14:45.144
in the early hours of Sunday morning
in a distraught state.

01:14:45.184 --> 01:14:46.984
Wrong!
A young lad...

01:14:47.024 --> 01:14:49.623
..well, a stranger, practically,

01:14:49.663 --> 01:14:52.184
bulldozes his way into your life

01:14:52.223 --> 01:14:54.503
and shows no sign of retreating.

01:14:55.663 --> 01:14:59.104
And here he is holding you to account
for your actions

01:14:59.144 --> 01:15:01.263
as an unfaithful husband.

01:15:01.303 --> 01:15:02.784
I didn't kill him!

01:15:02.824 --> 01:15:05.303
And I don't know anything
about a phone call!

01:15:05.343 --> 01:15:06.904
Now, his parents,

01:15:06.944 --> 01:15:11.623
the people who have loved and
cared for him these last 19 years...

01:15:12.704 --> 01:15:15.463
..are waiting for me
to knock on their door

01:15:15.503 --> 01:15:19.704
and tell them
that I have caught whoever did this!

01:15:22.463 --> 01:15:26.263
Now, I'd like to be able to tell them
that you are cooperating...

01:15:27.463 --> 01:15:30.223
..and that what happened
on Saturday night and Sunday morning

01:15:30.263 --> 01:15:33.104
was a series of devastating events

01:15:33.144 --> 01:15:36.303
leading to a catastrophic end.

01:15:37.303 --> 01:15:40.223
But it was an accident...

01:15:41.864 --> 01:15:43.784
..and that you are sorry.

01:15:52.744 --> 01:15:54.623
That's not going to happen.

01:16:25.104 --> 01:16:26.383
Mark...

01:16:27.423 --> 01:16:29.583
Have you got that list
of outgoing calls

01:16:29.623 --> 01:16:31.463
from Julia Walken's cottage yet?

01:16:31.503 --> 01:16:33.663
They've just come in, ma'am.
They're on your desk.

01:16:42.543 --> 01:16:43.944
Are you all right?

01:16:45.024 --> 01:16:48.904
Erm, I need Dennis' next of kin
contact details.

01:17:03.064 --> 01:17:04.984
Joshua did hear him right.

01:17:05.024 --> 01:17:07.343
Dennis did call his dad.

01:17:10.704 --> 01:17:12.503
He called Rob!

01:17:12.543 --> 01:17:13.824
Ah...

01:17:13.864 --> 01:17:17.263
And I think that's why
he came into the station.

01:17:17.303 --> 01:17:19.904
To hand himself in.

01:17:19.944 --> 01:17:21.543
We need to get over there.

01:17:21.583 --> 01:17:23.104
OK, let's go.
Let's go! Let's go!

01:17:43.744 --> 01:17:45.984
We need to speak to your husband,
love.

01:17:46.024 --> 01:17:47.463
He's not in.

01:17:48.583 --> 01:17:49.744
Why?

01:17:49.784 --> 01:17:52.543
What's wrong?
Stephanie, focus on me, love.

01:17:52.583 --> 01:17:55.104
You, sit down. It's all right.
Look at me.

01:17:55.144 --> 01:17:56.623
Now, then...

01:17:56.663 --> 01:17:59.704
..did you know
that Dennis called your husband

01:17:59.744 --> 01:18:01.864
in the early hours of Sunday morning?

01:18:01.904 --> 01:18:03.383
No.

01:18:03.423 --> 01:18:04.503
Mm.

01:18:04.543 --> 01:18:06.463
Dennis called Rob's mobile.

01:18:08.343 --> 01:18:10.543
Are you sure you knew nothing
about that, Stephanie?

01:18:17.463 --> 01:18:19.423
Well, we need to speak to him, pet.

01:18:19.463 --> 01:18:21.024
Why?

01:18:21.064 --> 01:18:22.423
Do you know where he is?

01:18:23.423 --> 01:18:24.423
Hm?

01:18:25.383 --> 01:18:27.543
Have you any idea at all...

01:18:28.543 --> 01:18:30.263
..where he might be, love?

01:18:30.303 --> 01:18:31.864
I'm sorry, I don't know.

01:18:34.704 --> 01:18:36.263
Oh, that's OK, love.

01:18:47.583 --> 01:18:50.904
Now, your husband told us
that fishing was their thing.

01:18:50.944 --> 01:18:53.864
Where was this taken, love, hm?

01:18:55.223 --> 01:18:56.824
Where is that?

01:18:58.864 --> 01:19:00.543
Coral Bay.

01:19:02.744 --> 01:19:04.184
Thanks, love.

01:19:04.223 --> 01:19:06.104
Now, my officer
is going to stay with you.

01:19:06.144 --> 01:19:07.144
Hm?

01:19:37.144 --> 01:19:38.904
That's his motor.

01:19:54.744 --> 01:19:58.104
Right, Aiden, go down there
and start looking.

01:19:58.144 --> 01:19:59.984
Now, I need you two to stay up here.

01:20:00.024 --> 01:20:03.343
Cordon off the lane
and let no-one through. Yes, ma'am.

01:20:19.864 --> 01:20:21.463
Come on, Rob!

01:20:21.503 --> 01:20:23.064
Aiden...?

01:20:23.104 --> 01:20:24.263
Come on, Rob.
Come on.

01:20:26.583 --> 01:20:29.104
Get the paramedics down here now!

01:20:37.583 --> 01:20:38.984
Pills and vodka.

01:20:39.024 --> 01:20:41.383
I need an ETA and ambulance.

01:20:41.423 --> 01:20:44.064
This is dispatch. On its way.
ETA, 15 minutes.

01:20:44.104 --> 01:20:46.423
Are you performing CPR?
Yeah.

01:20:52.024 --> 01:20:53.144
OK...

01:20:53.184 --> 01:20:55.503
Careful over these pebbles.
I've got him.

01:21:05.744 --> 01:21:07.864
They reckon we got him just in time.

01:21:09.263 --> 01:21:10.784
Well done, Aiden.

01:21:13.263 --> 01:21:14.503
And you.

01:21:18.463 --> 01:21:20.064
Right, come on.

01:21:39.543 --> 01:21:41.784
He called about 3:15.

01:21:44.184 --> 01:21:46.303
He wanted to come home.

01:21:46.343 --> 01:21:48.104
To see Steph.

01:21:49.984 --> 01:21:51.303
He'd been at the party,

01:21:51.343 --> 01:21:53.663
but he'd ended up somewhere else,
with someone else.

01:21:56.144 --> 01:21:59.663
Eventually I got an address out of
him and I drove down to pick him up.

01:22:01.503 --> 01:22:03.144
And how was he?

01:22:03.184 --> 01:22:04.944
He wanted answers.

01:22:07.144 --> 01:22:08.784
Why did we lie?

01:22:08.824 --> 01:22:12.583
How could we watch him
build the family tree bit by bit,

01:22:12.623 --> 01:22:15.303
when we could have just told him
who Thomas was?

01:22:17.383 --> 01:22:19.543
When we could have just told him
the truth.

01:22:21.543 --> 01:22:22.904
He was angry.

01:22:23.944 --> 01:22:25.904
More than angry.

01:22:25.944 --> 01:22:27.623
I couldn't take him home like that.

01:22:27.663 --> 01:22:29.864
I didn't want her to feel
what I felt.

01:22:31.704 --> 01:22:34.543
I wanted to deal with it for her,
for him,

01:22:34.583 --> 01:22:37.024
and sort it all out and take him
home ready to forgive,

01:22:37.064 --> 01:22:39.543
ready to understand.
HE SIGHS

01:22:39.583 --> 01:22:41.583
Ready to be a family again.

01:22:43.784 --> 01:22:47.144
So you picked him up
from near that cottage, hm?

01:22:48.343 --> 01:22:50.144
Where did you go?

01:22:50.184 --> 01:22:51.463
I just drove.

01:22:51.503 --> 01:22:53.623
I let him rant and rave.

01:22:54.744 --> 01:22:56.343
And cry.

01:22:56.383 --> 01:22:58.944
And drink. He was still drinking.
I asked him to stop.

01:22:58.984 --> 01:23:01.303
I told him it wasn't helping,
that it was making it worse,

01:23:01.343 --> 01:23:02.704
but he wouldn't.

01:23:03.864 --> 01:23:06.223
So what happened then?

01:23:06.263 --> 01:23:08.184
He realised
I wasn't driving him home.

01:23:09.263 --> 01:23:10.663
He went nuts.

01:23:10.704 --> 01:23:12.184
I pulled over.

01:23:12.223 --> 01:23:14.423
He stopped shouting
and we sat there. Just...

01:23:15.984 --> 01:23:17.423
..sat there.

01:23:18.663 --> 01:23:22.104
And when I looked up,
I realised where we were.

01:23:23.784 --> 01:23:26.184
The turning for Coral Bay.

01:23:28.104 --> 01:23:29.824
I carried on.

01:23:29.864 --> 01:23:31.463
We drove down to the bay

01:23:31.503 --> 01:23:33.663
and I got him out of the car
for a walk.

01:23:35.824 --> 01:23:38.543
I wanted him to remember
being there.

01:23:38.583 --> 01:23:43.383
I wanted to shock him
into remembering our lives before.

01:23:45.303 --> 01:23:47.704
Together, the three of us.

01:23:50.064 --> 01:23:52.303
There was this boat there, just...

01:23:52.343 --> 01:23:54.704
..just like the one we used
when he were little.

01:23:54.744 --> 01:23:57.463
He wanted to go out in it.
He tried to go out in it.

01:23:57.503 --> 01:24:00.383
We sat there in the boat,
him with the whisky.

01:24:00.423 --> 01:24:05.343
And I just had this urge to scoop
him up and carry him home to bed.

01:24:08.704 --> 01:24:10.423
He was calmer then.

01:24:10.463 --> 01:24:12.343
And it was still down there and...

01:24:13.463 --> 01:24:14.744
..quiet.

01:24:14.784 --> 01:24:17.383
He asked me about the first time
I met him.

01:24:18.583 --> 01:24:20.704
The first time I held him as a baby.

01:24:22.463 --> 01:24:24.064
I told him.

01:24:26.503 --> 01:24:28.984
I said it
exactly how I remembered it.

01:24:30.583 --> 01:24:32.944
How he had this weird thing
with his finger.

01:24:34.623 --> 01:24:36.303
His baby finger.

01:24:36.343 --> 01:24:40.343
He'd wrap his fingers around my
little one and lift his baby one up.

01:24:43.383 --> 01:24:45.343
Like the way posh people drink tea.

01:24:45.383 --> 01:24:47.184
HE LAUGHS

01:24:47.223 --> 01:24:49.383
Yeah, with the pinkie up.

01:24:53.824 --> 01:24:56.383
And I got it.
I got why I was here.

01:24:56.423 --> 01:24:58.184
You know, to love that finger.

01:24:59.944 --> 01:25:02.583
And all his fingers
and his hands and his face.

01:25:02.623 --> 01:25:04.343
All of him.
To love all of him.

01:25:05.503 --> 01:25:07.223
And to protect him.

01:25:10.463 --> 01:25:12.144
And to be his dad.

01:25:18.944 --> 01:25:20.623
One minute, he was listening.

01:25:20.663 --> 01:25:22.824
The next minute,
he was up out of the boat.

01:25:22.864 --> 01:25:24.784
He was charging around.

01:25:26.663 --> 01:25:29.144
You know, swinging at me
and shouting...

01:25:30.303 --> 01:25:31.623
..about Steph,

01:25:34.024 --> 01:25:36.663
He was her world.
And to hear him...

01:25:39.343 --> 01:25:41.184
That's when I lost it.

01:25:42.864 --> 01:25:45.144
He dropped the bottle and...

01:25:46.343 --> 01:25:48.184
I don't know.

01:25:48.223 --> 01:25:50.144
The next thing I remember,
he was just there,

01:25:50.184 --> 01:25:51.503
there, in front of me.

01:25:51.543 --> 01:25:52.744
He was lying on his back.

01:25:54.184 --> 01:25:56.704
I must have hit him with the bottle.

01:25:57.824 --> 01:25:59.223
He was dead.

01:26:08.303 --> 01:26:09.784
I pushed him away.

01:26:09.824 --> 01:26:12.623
Not to push him into the water,
but to push the sight away,

01:26:12.663 --> 01:26:15.104
to make it go away.

01:26:16.944 --> 01:26:19.184
And I kept on pushing
till he was gone.

01:26:22.024 --> 01:26:23.503
And then he was.

01:26:26.744 --> 01:26:28.184
He was gone.

01:26:35.064 --> 01:26:36.623
Robert Bayliss...

01:26:38.784 --> 01:26:42.064
..I'm arresting you for the murder
of Dennis Bayliss.

01:26:42.104 --> 01:26:43.984
You do not have to say anything,

01:26:44.024 --> 01:26:47.944
but it may harm your defence if
you fail to mention, when questioned,

01:26:47.984 --> 01:26:49.824
something you later rely on in court.

01:27:09.704 --> 01:27:11.263
Do you think every child grows up

01:27:11.303 --> 01:27:13.824
thinking they've been born into
the wrong family?

01:27:13.864 --> 01:27:15.104
Hm?

01:27:15.144 --> 01:27:19.104
That there's a better fit
out there somewhere.

01:27:19.144 --> 01:27:21.984
A more understanding mam.
A more patient dad.

01:27:22.024 --> 01:27:23.623
Hm?

01:27:23.663 --> 01:27:25.303
I don't know.

01:27:25.343 --> 01:27:28.064
Is that what you thought?
No, I didn't think that.

01:27:29.144 --> 01:27:30.503
I was certain of it.

01:27:30.543 --> 01:27:32.064
THEY BOTH CHUCKLE

01:27:33.784 --> 01:27:35.784
How about you?
Did you ever think that?

01:27:37.423 --> 01:27:38.784
I can't say that I did.

01:27:39.904 --> 01:27:41.223
Are you all right?

01:27:42.824 --> 01:27:45.303
Is it all right if I get off?
Aye.

01:27:45.343 --> 01:27:47.503
Go on,
get home to that lad of yours.

01:27:47.543 --> 01:27:49.744
Come on, I'll drop you off.
I'm going to walk.

01:27:54.144 --> 01:27:56.744
See you tomorrow.
Aye, see you tomorrow.

01:28:05.024 --> 01:28:06.303
Aiden...

01:28:10.263 --> 01:28:12.423
It's about six mile.

01:28:25.423 --> 01:28:26.864
I'll jump in, then.

01:28:34.383 --> 01:28:36.064
