00:04.704 --> 00:06.438
Walter:
<i>My name is walter o'brien.</i>

00:06.440 --> 00:10.709
<i>I have the fourth highest iq</i>
<i>ever recorded: 197.</i>

00:10.711 --> 00:12.444
<i>Einstein's was 160.</i>

00:12.446 --> 00:15.114
<i>When I was 11, the fbi</i>
<i>arrested me for hacking nasa</i>

00:15.116 --> 00:17.716
<i>To get their blueprints</i>
<i>for my bedroom wall.</i>

00:17.718 --> 00:19.752
<i>Now I run a team of geniuses,</i>

00:19.754 --> 00:21.387
<i>Tackling worldwide threats</i>

00:21.389 --> 00:22.654
<i>Only we can solve.</i>

00:22.656 --> 00:24.556
<i>Toby's our behaviorist.</i>

00:24.558 --> 00:26.392
Sylvester's a human calculator.

00:26.394 --> 00:28.560
<i>Happy, a mechanical prodigy.</i>

00:28.562 --> 00:31.063
<i>Agent cabe gallo's</i>
<i>our government handler.</i>

00:31.065 --> 00:33.298
<i>And paige?</i>
<i>Well, paige isn't like us.</i>

00:33.300 --> 00:35.567
<i>She's normal</i>
<i>and translates the world for us</i>

00:35.569 --> 00:38.370
<i>While we help her understand</i>
<i>her genius son.</i>

00:38.372 --> 00:40.305
<i>Together, we are scorpion.</i>

00:43.243 --> 00:46.245
Paige: Now that this
has happened between us,

00:46.247 --> 00:49.314
We can't let it
confuse ralph, you know?

00:51.251 --> 00:54.820
Uh, you coming into ralph's life
has been so important to him.

00:56.790 --> 00:58.357
You know what I'm saying, drew?

01:02.695 --> 01:04.663
Walter.

01:04.665 --> 01:06.365
What are you doing here?

01:06.367 --> 01:07.833
You know why I'm here.

01:07.835 --> 01:09.501
Because you've been
thinking about me.

01:09.503 --> 01:11.370
(gasps)

01:11.372 --> 01:13.839
What the hell?

01:16.643 --> 01:18.143
Book.

01:18.145 --> 01:19.378
Three words.

01:19.380 --> 01:21.847
Darn it, I knew
it'd be too easy.

01:23.716 --> 01:24.750
Paige:
Morning.

01:24.752 --> 01:26.785
You look frazzled.
Thank you.

01:26.787 --> 01:28.520
Grumpy, too.

01:28.522 --> 01:30.656
Sorry, I didn't sleep.

01:30.658 --> 01:32.257
I had a weird dream.

01:32.259 --> 01:33.525
About what?

01:34.627 --> 01:36.862
I don't remember the details.

01:36.864 --> 01:38.163
That's unsurprising.

01:38.165 --> 01:40.699
Our brains often
protect us

01:40.701 --> 01:43.669
By suppressing
our memories of them.

01:43.671 --> 01:46.672
What does it mean when
you remember a dream vividly?

01:46.674 --> 01:48.440
Means that we enjoyed it.

01:50.176 --> 01:52.277
Hey, relax, you can play
charades with us--
it'll be fun.

01:52.279 --> 01:55.114
Playing charades
with geniuses is never fun.

01:55.116 --> 01:56.782
Come on, we need
fresh blood.

01:56.784 --> 01:59.318
Okay.
(clears throat)

01:59.320 --> 02:00.552
Movie.

02:02.188 --> 02:03.822
Three words.

02:03.824 --> 02:05.224
All:
<i>Sleepless in seattle.</i>

02:05.226 --> 02:05.891
See what I mean?

02:05.893 --> 02:08.127
Toby:
Cabe, charades.

02:08.129 --> 02:09.795
I told you never again.

02:09.797 --> 02:12.297
Besides, we got a case.

02:12.299 --> 02:14.500
And this one's not
from homeland.

02:14.502 --> 02:17.269
Cia?

02:17.271 --> 02:20.439
Their internal affairs division
intercepted an encrypted message

02:20.441 --> 02:23.709
That was sent by someone in the
agency's los angeles office.

02:23.711 --> 02:25.777
They have no idea
what it contains.

02:25.779 --> 02:27.746
A leak.
A leak...

02:27.748 --> 02:29.281
That has given
classified information

02:29.283 --> 02:30.749
To a very dangerous
foreign government.

02:30.751 --> 02:32.584
Yemen.

02:32.586 --> 02:34.253
Could be battle plans,
state secrets, or intel

02:34.255 --> 02:35.754
That could jeopardize
national security.

02:35.756 --> 02:38.590
Cia wants you to find the leak
and recover whatever was given

02:38.592 --> 02:40.926
To the enemy before it becomes
a potential catastrophe.

02:40.928 --> 02:45.164
Why does one of the world's top
spy organizations need our help?

02:45.166 --> 02:47.299
They can't use their
own encryption analysts

02:47.301 --> 02:49.902
Because the leak could be
anyone inside the agency.

02:49.904 --> 02:51.770
Bingo.

02:51.772 --> 02:53.272
No more games.

02:53.274 --> 02:55.440
It's time to get to work.

02:56.876 --> 02:58.877
This is a black box
combinatorial pointer tree

02:58.879 --> 03:00.445
Encryption algorithm.

03:00.447 --> 03:01.847
So you can't get in?

03:01.849 --> 03:03.582
No, I cracked it.

03:03.584 --> 03:04.650
Guys.

03:05.585 --> 03:06.718
Walter:
Okay...

03:06.720 --> 03:09.221
No names or markers

03:09.223 --> 03:11.523
To identify the source
or recipients.

03:11.525 --> 03:13.725
But we do have the text
of the message.

03:13.727 --> 03:16.962
"a minute away from you
is a lifetime.

03:16.964 --> 03:19.498
"I love you with all my heart.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.333
"soon we'll be together.

03:21.335 --> 03:22.634
B.O.O."

03:22.636 --> 03:24.503
It's a love letter.
It's a code.

03:24.505 --> 03:26.338
"b.O.O." could be
"base of operations."

03:26.340 --> 03:27.372
Or "black ops officer."

03:27.374 --> 03:28.874
Or "boo," like
a pet name.

03:28.876 --> 03:31.476
Maybe whoever sent it
is in love.

03:31.478 --> 03:33.345
Paige, I've read a lot
about espionage,

03:33.347 --> 03:35.480
Including every issue
of   <i>robo-spies--</i>

03:35.482 --> 03:36.915
Definitely a
top-five comic

03:36.917 --> 03:39.284
Of the spy robot genre--

03:39.286 --> 03:43.288
And "boo" is not how spies would
normally refer to one another.

03:43.290 --> 03:48.560
If they were to add sentimental
verbiage, it would increase

03:48.562 --> 03:49.995
Their odds of getting caught--
it would be illogical.

03:49.997 --> 03:51.997
Love is illogical.

03:51.999 --> 03:52.998
It's a code within a code.

03:53.000 --> 03:53.999
But this has random text,

03:54.001 --> 03:55.767
It could take
days to break.

03:55.769 --> 03:57.302
So, to plug the leak,

03:57.304 --> 03:59.605
We first go to the
l.A. Branch of the cia

03:59.607 --> 04:03.609
And selectively profile to see
who would betray their country.

04:03.611 --> 04:06.245
And once we have found them,
then we dive into their system.

04:06.247 --> 04:07.646
Sylvester: How do we
profile those guys?

04:07.648 --> 04:11.283
They have highly trained agents
and state-of-the-art technology.

04:11.285 --> 04:13.252
Yes, but we have you guys.

04:22.395 --> 04:23.662
Agent:
Internal affairs knows the leak

04:23.664 --> 04:25.297
Came from this cia office,

04:25.299 --> 04:27.299
But it could be anybody
in any division.

04:27.301 --> 04:28.634
Division five--
psych ops,

04:28.636 --> 04:30.302
Division nine--
languages,

04:30.304 --> 04:31.803
Division 12--
skunkworks,

04:31.805 --> 04:33.805
Where we create
our classified technology.

04:33.807 --> 04:35.340
But we have eight
more divisions,

04:35.342 --> 04:37.476
Plus field agents
and support staff

04:37.478 --> 04:39.478
That also...

04:39.480 --> 04:41.413
Shouldn't have mentioned
the technology.

04:42.348 --> 04:43.415
Pen pick.

04:43.417 --> 04:44.716
Looks like a pen,

04:44.718 --> 04:45.951
But can pick any lock.

04:45.953 --> 04:48.053
All I need is a paper clip.

04:50.657 --> 04:52.324
Gecko hands.

04:52.326 --> 04:53.659
For climbing walls.

04:53.661 --> 04:55.661
Even those made of glass.

04:55.663 --> 04:57.896
Catsuit not included.

04:57.898 --> 04:59.331
Do you own a catsuit?

05:03.436 --> 05:05.637
Wearable electromagnetic
bullet shield.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.506
It won't dampen
concussive force,

05:07.508 --> 05:09.308
But it does deflect the
path of a metal bullet

05:09.310 --> 05:11.777
By up to four inches.

05:11.779 --> 05:13.345
Which can be enough
to save a life.

05:13.347 --> 05:15.080
Oh!

05:19.619 --> 05:22.487
Can you do <i>that</i>
<i>with a paper clip?</i>

05:24.457 --> 05:25.791
Field trip's over, kids.

05:25.793 --> 05:28.427
We got work to do.

05:28.429 --> 05:29.761
Toby:
Hey, did you see that?

05:29.763 --> 05:31.063
A woman who's pretty,

05:31.065 --> 05:33.498
Mechanically inclined
<i>and</i> nice.

05:34.467 --> 05:35.834
Shut up.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.338
I brought in our top agents
from around the world.

05:39.340 --> 05:40.672
You'll have carte blanche
to question them.

05:40.674 --> 05:41.673
Send them home.

05:41.675 --> 05:42.841
I'm sorry?

05:42.843 --> 05:45.477
Your top spies, the ones
in expensive suits

05:45.479 --> 05:47.612
Who travel the world
on exciting missions.

05:47.614 --> 05:50.615
They may be experts at
disguise, charming people,

05:50.617 --> 05:53.618
Chasing bad guys, but they
could never program the level

05:53.620 --> 05:54.820
Of encryption
that message had.

05:54.822 --> 05:57.556
The leak isn't one
of the cool kids.

05:57.558 --> 05:58.890
It's someone like us.

05:58.892 --> 06:00.559
Someone who does the coding.

06:00.561 --> 06:02.894
The grunt work
that makes them look good.

06:02.896 --> 06:04.730
Where are the guys
with the faces for radio?

06:09.802 --> 06:11.069
Our people.

06:11.071 --> 06:13.372
Toby, you getting anything
from these guys?

06:13.374 --> 06:15.374
Did they rush mozart
when he wrote a sonata?

06:15.376 --> 06:16.441
You got nothing,
do you?

06:16.443 --> 06:17.442
Not a thing.

06:17.444 --> 06:18.443
Paige:
Humor me a sec.

06:18.445 --> 06:19.778
What if the code
wasn't a code?

06:19.780 --> 06:21.446
I mean, call me crazy,
but maybe

06:21.448 --> 06:22.881
"soon we will be together"
really meant

06:22.883 --> 06:24.549
"soon we will be together."

06:24.551 --> 06:26.952
If the leak was in love,

06:26.954 --> 06:28.387
How would you profile him?

06:28.389 --> 06:30.389
Well, for one thing,
love increases serotonin,

06:30.391 --> 06:31.923
Which means more
energy and alertness.

06:31.925 --> 06:34.559
So I would eliminate those
three guys along the east wall.

06:34.561 --> 06:36.561
They're exhausted;
no <i>joie de vivre.</i>

06:36.563 --> 06:37.829
Probably married.

06:37.831 --> 06:39.398
Has anyone here
recently lost

06:39.400 --> 06:41.800
A lot of weight trying
to look good for someone?

06:41.802 --> 06:44.569
Well, tim, leonard and susan
have all dropped some weight.

06:44.571 --> 06:45.737
Paige:
Any vacation days?

06:45.739 --> 06:47.472
Especially fridays and mondays?

06:47.474 --> 06:48.673
What would that indicate?

06:48.675 --> 06:50.542
Romantic three-day weekends.

06:50.544 --> 06:51.643
Ever had one?

06:51.645 --> 06:53.512
Kind of, yeah.

06:53.514 --> 06:54.846
She left after one day.

06:54.848 --> 06:59.184
Susan and tim have taken just
four vacation days between them,

06:59.186 --> 07:00.986
But leonard's taken
five personal days

07:00.988 --> 07:02.487
In the last
three months,

07:02.489 --> 07:05.190
Plus four sick days--
all on fridays and mondays.

07:05.192 --> 07:08.660
Paige is right--
he is a man in <i>l'amour.</i>

07:08.662 --> 07:10.896
That's all the information you
needed to make that assessment?

07:10.898 --> 07:12.898
No, look at his nails--
he had a manicure.

07:12.900 --> 07:15.467
Only one thing'll make a man
sit through one of those--

07:15.469 --> 07:18.670
Cabe: So the guy's got
the hots for someone.

07:18.672 --> 07:20.672
Doesn't mean he'd do
anything unlawful.

07:20.674 --> 07:21.840
We need to talk to him.

07:21.842 --> 07:22.707
Leonard...

07:23.876 --> 07:26.044
You got a moment?
Yes, of course.

07:30.850 --> 07:32.484
Cabe:
<i>You're in trouble, leonard.</i>

07:32.486 --> 07:36.121
We searched your computer,
we searched all your files.

07:36.123 --> 07:38.657
Why would you be sending
encrypted forget-me-nots

07:38.659 --> 07:40.659
To someone
in a hostile government?

07:40.661 --> 07:42.027
Never heard of hallmark?

07:42.029 --> 07:44.062
I know my rights,
I don't have to help you.

07:44.064 --> 07:46.064
We got your access card;
we read your magnetic code.

07:46.066 --> 07:47.666
You've been making trips

07:47.668 --> 07:49.167
To the cia chem lab.

07:49.169 --> 07:51.670
Internal affairs is searching
to find out what went missing.

07:51.672 --> 07:54.005
If we discover that you gave
dangerous materials

07:54.007 --> 07:55.674
To foreign nationals,

07:55.676 --> 07:57.542
You'll face treason charges.

07:57.544 --> 07:58.543
(sighs)

07:58.545 --> 07:59.544
Okay.

07:59.546 --> 08:01.546
I did sneak out
some chemicals.

08:01.548 --> 08:04.015
But it was just to give them
to an aid worker.

08:04.017 --> 08:07.686
You're a cia analyst admitting
to a major violation,

08:07.688 --> 08:10.088
Yet show no markers
of shame or embarrassment.

08:10.090 --> 08:11.256
Why?

08:11.258 --> 08:13.258
Because I didn't do
anything wrong.

08:13.260 --> 08:15.494
Now, it's technically illegal,

08:15.496 --> 08:18.830
But it's for a legitimate
humanitarian cause.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.999
This is to help
poor people in yemen.

08:22.969 --> 08:25.237
What do the poor
need chemicals for?

08:25.239 --> 08:27.172
Leonard:
Because of embargos.

08:27.174 --> 08:28.507
Yemeni farmers can't get
these chemicals

08:28.509 --> 08:30.509
To make basic pesticides.

08:30.511 --> 08:32.010
Which means that
they can't grow crops,

08:32.012 --> 08:34.179
Which is why
they are starving.

08:34.181 --> 08:37.182
Now, I-I got her two chemicals,
I was gonna get her one more,

08:37.184 --> 08:38.984
So that she could save
millions.

08:38.986 --> 08:40.285
If they are used
to make pesticides,

08:40.287 --> 08:41.720
Why can't she just buy them?

08:41.722 --> 08:43.722
They're toxic--
they're tightly regulated.

08:43.724 --> 08:46.057
And-and I would do
anything to help her.

08:46.059 --> 08:47.659
We're in love.

08:49.629 --> 08:50.962
Love is imaginary.

08:50.964 --> 08:52.964
What's real are
those chemicals.

08:52.966 --> 08:54.633
Which ones did you give her?

08:54.635 --> 08:57.302
Phosphorus trichloride and
liquid trans-methyl propylaxine.

08:57.304 --> 08:59.671
Now, the third one that
I haven't brought her yet

08:59.673 --> 09:00.805
Is o-ethyl methyphonic acid.

09:00.807 --> 09:04.242
Combined, these chemicals
make pesticide.

09:04.244 --> 09:05.911
They can also
be adjusted.

09:05.913 --> 09:07.913
If you methylate
the phosphorus trichloride,

09:07.915 --> 09:10.916
It forms methyl phosphorus
dichloride...

09:10.918 --> 09:13.618
Which, when combined with the
liquid trans-methyl propylaxine

09:13.620 --> 09:14.719
And the o-ethyl
methyphonic acid,

09:14.721 --> 09:16.621
Creates tiny particles.

09:16.623 --> 09:18.757
Very deadly, easily aerosolized,

09:18.759 --> 09:20.559
And completely different
from pesticides.

09:20.561 --> 09:21.893
It's nerve gas.

09:21.895 --> 09:23.295
Leonard:
What...?!

09:24.597 --> 09:25.931
I-I-I didn't know that.

09:25.933 --> 09:27.265
N-no, it's irrelevant.

09:27.267 --> 09:28.600
Y-you guys have it all wrong.

09:28.602 --> 09:29.267
Sima is a good person.

09:29.269 --> 09:31.169
She targeted you, man.

09:31.171 --> 09:32.871
That's ridiculous!

09:32.873 --> 09:34.005
No, sima is...

09:34.007 --> 09:35.073
She's playing you.

09:35.075 --> 09:38.043
She made you think that
she was in love with you

09:38.045 --> 09:39.277
So you would give her
those chemicals.

09:39.279 --> 09:40.645
You're wrong.

09:40.647 --> 09:42.113
And if I'm not,

09:42.115 --> 09:44.149
We can't stop her...

09:44.151 --> 09:45.350
Millions could die.

10:02.702 --> 10:04.302
Cia and interpol are
checking sima's background,

10:04.304 --> 10:06.304
But so far they've got
nothing on a woman

10:06.306 --> 10:10.275
All you need is a few teaspoons
to kill tens of thousands.

10:10.277 --> 10:11.810
He took <i>pounds</i> of this stuff.

10:11.812 --> 10:13.979
Yet we show him strong evidence

10:13.981 --> 10:15.814
That sima might be trying
to manipulate him,

10:15.816 --> 10:18.183
And he's still blinded
by emotion-- I don't get it.

10:18.185 --> 10:20.085
Love makes you do
crazy things.

10:20.087 --> 10:22.654
That is why there are
so many songs written about it.

10:22.656 --> 10:23.688
"crazy love"
by van morrison,

10:23.690 --> 10:26.157
"crazy in love" by beyoncÃ©,

10:26.159 --> 10:28.693
Just plain "crazy"
by patsy cline and aerosmith.

10:28.695 --> 10:31.096
Love is a semi-euphoric,
temporary chemical reaction.

10:31.098 --> 10:33.264
Aw, how romantic.

10:33.266 --> 10:34.366
What is that
under your shirt?

10:34.368 --> 10:36.067
Nothing.
You stole

10:36.069 --> 10:37.902
The cia's electromagnetic
bullet shield.

10:37.904 --> 10:39.704
The pretty science lady
gave me a prototype.

10:39.706 --> 10:41.406
I guess she likes
the cut of my jib

10:41.408 --> 10:43.408
And my understated
sexual charisma.

10:43.410 --> 10:46.077
We don't need prototypes;
we need a plan.

10:46.079 --> 10:47.679
Soon sima will wonder why

10:47.681 --> 10:49.381
She hasn't heard from leonard,
she'll get suspicious.

10:49.383 --> 10:51.750
Once that happens,
we won't find her.

10:51.752 --> 10:53.118
Leonard's not cooperating.

10:53.986 --> 10:55.387
He may not talk to us,

10:55.389 --> 10:57.856
But we can make him talk to her.

10:57.858 --> 10:59.424
Cabe: We're gonna
keep looking into this,

10:59.426 --> 11:00.825
But for now
we're letting you go.

11:00.827 --> 11:02.360
But before we do,
we need evidence

11:02.362 --> 11:05.063
And were questioned
according to protocol.

11:05.898 --> 11:07.332
Walter:
Read it out loud.

11:07.334 --> 11:09.234
I'm recording it.

11:09.236 --> 11:11.703
"my name is leonard carlton.

11:11.705 --> 11:14.439
"I admit to violating
cia regulations

11:14.441 --> 11:16.708
"but no criminal wrongdoing.

11:16.710 --> 11:18.710
Today I was questioned..."

11:18.712 --> 11:20.712
Is this going to work?
Yes.

11:20.714 --> 11:22.714
When walter was in high school,
he created

11:22.716 --> 11:25.850
A similar voice converter
to sound just like his mother.

11:25.852 --> 11:28.019
He used it once
to call in sick to school.

11:28.021 --> 11:30.088
Walter o'brien played hooky?

11:30.090 --> 11:31.690
There was a quantum physics
lecture in dublin

11:31.692 --> 11:32.824
That he didn't want to miss.

11:32.826 --> 11:34.726
Of course there was.
Toby: Don't judge.

11:34.728 --> 11:36.695
The heart wants
what the heart wants.

11:36.697 --> 11:38.763
So does the brain.

11:44.103 --> 11:45.770
So...

11:45.772 --> 11:47.706
This is sort of a weird request,

11:47.708 --> 11:51.409
But you are a shrink, and...

11:51.411 --> 11:54.379
Well, I-I need someone
to talk to.

11:54.381 --> 11:56.114
Of course.

11:56.116 --> 11:58.016
Lie on my couch.

11:59.185 --> 12:00.852
(clears throat)

12:00.854 --> 12:02.754
It's about a guy.

12:02.756 --> 12:04.756
Go on.
See, I had a dream.

12:04.758 --> 12:06.458
Some disturbing,

12:06.460 --> 12:08.927
Inappropriate thoughts
about someone I shouldn't,

12:08.929 --> 12:11.996
Someone who probably
isn't good for me.

12:11.998 --> 12:13.298
I get it.

12:13.300 --> 12:14.365
Drew's handsome.

12:14.367 --> 12:16.000
Not bright or loyal,

12:16.002 --> 12:17.435
But handsome.

12:17.437 --> 12:19.104
Right.

12:19.106 --> 12:21.840
(clears throat)
see, leonard in there,

12:21.842 --> 12:23.475
He is letting his feelings
cloud his judgment,

12:23.477 --> 12:24.843
And I don't want to do that.

12:24.845 --> 12:26.478
Any advice?
Paige,

12:26.480 --> 12:28.480
I'm a brilliant doctor.

12:28.482 --> 12:31.216
You're not telling me everything
about this dream.

12:31.218 --> 12:33.518
Either you're being deceptive

12:33.520 --> 12:35.520
Or you're embarrassed, but...

12:35.522 --> 12:37.489
I can't help you until you're
ready to tell me everything.

12:37.491 --> 12:40.525
(laughs quietly)

12:42.094 --> 12:44.496
A mason can't build
without bricks, paige.

12:44.498 --> 12:46.798
I'm not a miracle worker.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.166
"I acknowledge
no wrongdoing

12:48.168 --> 12:51.870
And hereby certify
the aforementioned is accurate."

12:51.872 --> 12:53.538
Did we get everything?

12:55.808 --> 12:57.242
(walter mutters)

12:57.244 --> 13:00.545
Here, read that.

13:00.547 --> 13:01.980
"purple monkey dishwasher."

13:01.982 --> 13:03.047
What the hell does that mean?

13:03.049 --> 13:05.784
Hey, I thought
you were letting me go.

13:05.786 --> 13:07.786
Nope. See how easy it is
to get played?

13:07.788 --> 13:09.988
(sighs)

13:09.990 --> 13:11.422
Okay, I've downloaded

13:11.424 --> 13:12.457
His recording.
Within seconds

13:12.459 --> 13:15.093
My software will break it down

13:15.095 --> 13:18.296
Phonetically, and...
Transmute my voice so that

13:18.298 --> 13:19.397
On the other end,

13:19.399 --> 13:20.565
It will sound exactly...

13:20.567 --> 13:22.967
(in leonard's voice):
Like leonard.

13:22.969 --> 13:24.969
Now, with leonard's phone,

13:24.971 --> 13:27.238
I'll call sima,
pretending to be him,

13:27.240 --> 13:28.807
And set a meeting

13:28.809 --> 13:29.541
So we can find out

13:29.543 --> 13:31.276
Where she has the chemicals.

13:31.278 --> 13:33.111
Are you sure <i>you</i> should
be doing this?

13:33.113 --> 13:35.313
She calls him "boo."

13:35.315 --> 13:36.447
That's-that's
playful and fun.

13:36.449 --> 13:37.582
Two words that don't exactly

13:37.584 --> 13:39.417
Describe walter o'brien.

13:39.419 --> 13:41.186
It's setting an appointment.
I can handle this.

13:41.188 --> 13:42.987
Now...

13:42.989 --> 13:44.222
His voice will come through

13:44.224 --> 13:46.324
Her phone instead
of the speakers.

13:46.326 --> 13:48.326
(line rings)

13:48.328 --> 13:49.494
Sima: Hey, baby.

13:49.496 --> 13:50.495
Hello...

13:50.497 --> 13:52.864
You.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.300
Did you have a good day?

13:55.302 --> 13:56.868
(in leonard's voice):
Average. I hope you've had

13:56.870 --> 13:58.503
An efficient day yourself.

13:58.505 --> 14:00.438
(whispering): You're going
to give it away.

14:00.440 --> 14:01.840
Hold, please.

14:01.842 --> 14:04.075
What?
I'm making conversation.

14:04.077 --> 14:06.578
Be romantic, tell her you can't
stop thinking about her.

14:06.580 --> 14:07.579
Leonard?

14:12.051 --> 14:13.585
I can't stop thinking about you.

14:13.587 --> 14:15.587
Aw... Really?

14:15.589 --> 14:17.422
That's what I just said.
Paige: Oh.

14:18.357 --> 14:20.291
(sighs) honey,

14:20.293 --> 14:21.626
(in leonard's voice):
I miss you so much,

14:21.628 --> 14:22.927
Your face, your mind,

14:22.929 --> 14:25.063
Your body... (chuckles)

14:25.065 --> 14:27.098
I wish I were with you
right now just,

14:27.100 --> 14:30.568
Just touching you,
kissing you.

14:30.570 --> 14:32.470
(sima moans)

14:32.472 --> 14:34.606
That sounds so good.

14:34.608 --> 14:37.542
We should be
recording this, too.

14:37.544 --> 14:40.078
Sima:
When do I get to see you again?

14:40.080 --> 14:41.212
Soon,

14:41.214 --> 14:43.047
But, honey, uh,

14:43.049 --> 14:44.616
I've hit a snag.

14:44.618 --> 14:46.551
We have a problem
with the final delivery.

14:46.553 --> 14:50.321
They moved the third chemical
to a higher security lab.

14:50.323 --> 14:51.456
I don't have clearance.

14:51.458 --> 14:52.557
The guy who does,

14:52.559 --> 14:54.492
Marvin, would never help us.

14:54.494 --> 14:56.160
He's by the book.

14:56.162 --> 14:58.329
Does he carry
the same security card as you,

14:58.331 --> 15:00.365
Only with
the necessary clearance?

15:00.367 --> 15:01.466
Yes.

15:01.468 --> 15:02.667
If I get you that card,

15:02.669 --> 15:03.935
Can you get the chemical?

15:03.937 --> 15:05.069
Sure.

15:05.971 --> 15:07.372
But...

15:07.374 --> 15:08.640
How are you gonna get it?

15:08.642 --> 15:10.241
Don't you worry about that.

15:10.243 --> 15:13.411
Just ask marvin to meet you
for a drink at my hotel,

15:13.413 --> 15:15.513
And then,
at the last minute, cancel.

15:15.515 --> 15:16.681
Will you do that?

15:16.683 --> 15:18.917
(chuckles)
anything for you, honey.

15:18.919 --> 15:22.320
You're such a good person.

15:22.322 --> 15:24.188
I have to go now, my love,

15:24.190 --> 15:25.423
But I'll be in touch soon.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.659
I love you, baby.
I love you, too.

15:30.396 --> 15:31.596
That's how it's done.

15:31.598 --> 15:32.964
Sylvester:
We have her on tape

15:32.966 --> 15:34.032
Admitting to doing this.

15:34.034 --> 15:35.667
We can arrest her now.

15:35.669 --> 15:37.502
Well, we might have enough
to arrest her,

15:37.504 --> 15:39.404
But there's still two canisters
of dangerous chemicals

15:39.406 --> 15:41.439
Out there somewhere,
and that's two-thirds of the way

15:41.441 --> 15:42.674
To making nerve gas.

15:42.676 --> 15:44.075
We can't bring sima in yet.

15:44.077 --> 15:46.377
We need her to lead us
to those chemicals.

15:46.379 --> 15:48.112
Okay, so, who's gonna be marvin?

15:48.114 --> 15:50.181
Well, interpol's still doing
a background on sima,

15:50.183 --> 15:51.649
But there's no question
she's probably dangerous.

15:51.651 --> 15:53.351
So I'll do it.

15:53.353 --> 15:54.385
Walter:
No, you're-you're homeland.

15:54.387 --> 15:56.020
You're former fbi.

15:56.022 --> 15:57.989
She could have intel
on our agents.

15:57.991 --> 15:59.590
We can't risk her
I.D.'ing you.

15:59.592 --> 16:01.125
Sylvester can't do it;
he's a nervous wreck.

16:01.127 --> 16:03.127
He'd barf all over her.
I would.

16:03.129 --> 16:06.664
Well, I guess
I'll have to do it.

16:06.666 --> 16:08.666
I just hope she doesn't
fall in love with me, too.

16:08.668 --> 16:11.035
Cabe: No, intel indicates
that she probably works alone,

16:11.037 --> 16:13.004
But we can't be too careful.

16:13.006 --> 16:14.706
We need someone to profile
the crowd in that bar

16:14.708 --> 16:16.341
And make sure
she has no collaborators.

16:16.343 --> 16:18.009
Paige:
So we're down to walter?

16:18.011 --> 16:20.144
Am I the only person
who just heard that phone call?

16:20.146 --> 16:22.480
Oh, I learned a lot
from that exchange.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.382
Okay, we hack the
security cameras at the hotel,

16:24.384 --> 16:26.617
We put an earbud
in walter's ear, and we track

16:26.619 --> 16:29.020
The entire meeting.
Happy: And while
he distracts her,

16:29.022 --> 16:30.121
Toby and I search her room

16:30.123 --> 16:31.689
For evidence
of the stolen chemicals.

16:33.025 --> 16:34.592
After hearing your
performance on the phone,

16:34.594 --> 16:35.994
You're gonna need help.

16:35.996 --> 16:39.063
The story of the guy
with the rhinophyma,

16:39.065 --> 16:40.732
The large nose disease.

16:40.734 --> 16:43.034
You missed
the whole love story?

16:43.036 --> 16:45.503
I was focused
on his medical condition.

16:45.505 --> 16:48.206
(sighs)
come with me.

16:48.208 --> 16:50.708
This is not gonna be easy.

16:50.710 --> 16:54.312
Here, this color's good on you.

16:54.314 --> 16:58.016
(clears throat)

17:00.319 --> 17:01.786
That color <i>is</i> nice on you.

17:01.788 --> 17:03.021
Yeah?
Now, to give happy and toby

17:03.023 --> 17:04.288
Time to search her room,

17:04.290 --> 17:05.556
You'll need to
stall her in the bar.

17:05.558 --> 17:06.791
If she detects anything off,

17:06.793 --> 17:09.027
She could flee or make a call

17:09.029 --> 17:10.261
And those chemicals
could disappear forever,

17:10.263 --> 17:13.231
And if she did what
we think she did,

17:13.233 --> 17:15.533
She did it by using her allure.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.301
She'll do the same thing
with you,

17:17.303 --> 17:20.805
So you'll need to pretend like
you're falling for her charms.

17:20.807 --> 17:22.540
Copy that.

17:24.043 --> 17:25.743
Engage with her
on a personal level.

17:25.745 --> 17:26.711
No.

17:26.713 --> 17:28.780
No engaging-- flirting.

17:28.782 --> 17:31.516
Do you even know how?

17:31.518 --> 17:33.718
Look, you need to pick up
her vibe and return it.

17:33.720 --> 17:36.120
Let's practice; I'll flirt
with you, and you flirt back.

17:39.058 --> 17:41.125
(laughs quietly)

17:44.696 --> 17:46.531
Go ahead. Flirt back.

17:47.466 --> 17:49.333
I am.

17:49.335 --> 17:51.102
I mean, you need
to give off a vibe

17:51.104 --> 17:52.603
Like you're interested in me.

17:52.605 --> 17:54.205
Copy that.

17:54.207 --> 17:56.340
How's this?

17:59.078 --> 18:01.112
Okay, moving on.

18:01.114 --> 18:03.281
Uh, she'll probably try to steal
an access card from you,

18:03.283 --> 18:05.116
Even though you don't have one.

18:05.118 --> 18:07.752
She'll probably try to...

18:07.754 --> 18:09.720
Touch you.

18:09.722 --> 18:10.755
Feel your pocket.

18:10.757 --> 18:13.724
No, I don't enjoy contact.

18:13.726 --> 18:15.093
I know,
I've seen you hug people.

18:15.095 --> 18:16.861
It's like
you're in a leper colony.

18:16.863 --> 18:20.465
You need to be ready
for whatever she might do.

18:20.467 --> 18:22.133
(chuckling):
I can handle it.

18:22.135 --> 18:23.501
Can you?

18:23.503 --> 18:25.269
(scoffs quietly)

18:28.474 --> 18:32.310
What if...
She does... This?

18:34.246 --> 18:36.314
Or...

18:38.784 --> 18:40.585
...This?

18:40.587 --> 18:43.554
Why, I would be okay with that.

18:43.556 --> 18:46.124
And if she got...

18:46.126 --> 18:48.159
Close?

18:48.161 --> 18:49.227
(mutters quietly)

18:51.730 --> 18:53.164
I...

18:53.166 --> 18:54.398
I think I could

18:54.400 --> 18:56.567
Handle that.

18:58.137 --> 19:00.171
This could happen.

19:03.208 --> 19:05.843
I will be r-ready.

19:05.845 --> 19:07.278
I will be ready.

19:08.514 --> 19:10.381
Good work.

19:23.896 --> 19:25.863
Any sign of collaborators?

19:25.865 --> 19:27.765
Those three are
legitimately loaded.

19:27.767 --> 19:29.267
Spies do not get drunk
on the job.

19:29.269 --> 19:30.835
That couple

19:30.837 --> 19:32.203
Has a baby.

19:32.205 --> 19:33.671
That's a definite
espionage no-no.

19:33.673 --> 19:35.673
And those guys
are actually usc fans.

19:35.675 --> 19:37.208
You can tell
by how depressed they are.

19:37.210 --> 19:37.842
So, coast is clear.

19:37.844 --> 19:39.243
Sima's alone.

19:39.245 --> 19:40.578
Speak of the devil.

19:40.580 --> 19:41.913
That must be her.

19:41.915 --> 19:43.881
â™ª

19:43.883 --> 19:45.416
Toby:
Oh, my god.

19:45.418 --> 19:46.918
Walter's a dead man.

19:51.857 --> 19:53.925
Hi.
Hi.

19:55.194 --> 19:56.227
Meeting someone?

19:56.229 --> 19:57.895
Yeah, I was supposed to. My...

19:57.897 --> 20:01.199
He, uh, texted me

20:01.201 --> 20:02.300
He can't make it.

20:02.302 --> 20:04.969
Good.

20:04.971 --> 20:06.671
Then you can buy me a drink.

20:06.673 --> 20:07.772
I'm sima.

20:07.774 --> 20:09.774
Sima, marvin.
Pleasure.

20:09.776 --> 20:11.209
What are you having?

20:11.211 --> 20:12.810
I'm having...

20:12.812 --> 20:13.744
Water.

20:13.746 --> 20:15.213
He doesn't drink.

20:15.215 --> 20:17.481
But that's good,
because I want

20:17.483 --> 20:19.483
To remember the moment
a beautiful woman

20:19.485 --> 20:21.619
Asked me to have
a drink with her.

20:21.621 --> 20:23.921
But that is good, because
I want to remember the moment

20:23.923 --> 20:25.923
A beautiful woman asked me
to have a drink with her.

20:25.925 --> 20:27.925
Cabe:
Smoother

20:27.927 --> 20:29.594
Than the scotch
they're serving.

20:29.596 --> 20:31.429
Interpol report just came in.

20:31.431 --> 20:32.930
Sima's just an alias.

20:32.932 --> 20:33.965
Her real name is fatima.

20:33.967 --> 20:35.366
They tracked her activities.

20:35.368 --> 20:37.602
Tokyo, berlin, minsk?

20:37.604 --> 20:38.903
She has honey-trapped
half the agents

20:38.905 --> 20:40.404
In the western world.

20:40.406 --> 20:42.273
She's wanted for two
unsolved murders in prague.

20:42.275 --> 20:43.841
You got to be careful, walt.

20:43.843 --> 20:45.910
Scratch your temple
if you copy.

20:47.913 --> 20:49.880
Sylvester, you're up.

20:50.983 --> 20:52.350
Sylvester:
Did you say she was wanted

20:52.352 --> 20:53.484
For two murders?

20:53.486 --> 20:54.518
Go!

20:58.991 --> 21:00.658
Usc fan:
Come on!

21:00.660 --> 21:02.994
A shovel pass on
third and long?!

21:02.996 --> 21:05.529
That was an ineffective choice.

21:09.968 --> 21:12.003
It's not reading
the access card.

21:12.005 --> 21:13.437
Try moving the phone around.

21:14.973 --> 21:16.274
Get out of there!

21:16.975 --> 21:19.610
Got it. She's in 1002.

21:19.612 --> 21:21.312
What the hell
are you waiting for?

21:21.314 --> 21:24.448
Go see if there's any sign
of those chemicals.

21:24.450 --> 21:26.684
So, then the eight
told the seven,

21:26.686 --> 21:28.686
"what do you expect from me?
I'm a square root."

21:28.688 --> 21:30.755
(laughing)

21:33.058 --> 21:34.925
(weak laugh)

21:34.927 --> 21:36.594
So, you enjoy math humor.

21:36.596 --> 21:37.762
I love it.

21:37.764 --> 21:39.597
Man, she's good.

21:41.433 --> 21:42.800
Uh, walter,
she flipped her hair.

21:42.802 --> 21:44.335
That's a flirtation marker.

21:44.337 --> 21:46.404
Smile back.

21:47.873 --> 21:50.608
Less.

21:50.610 --> 21:52.443
He looks like he's birthing.

21:52.445 --> 21:54.378
What do you do, marvin?
I...

21:54.380 --> 21:55.479
Work for the government.

21:55.481 --> 21:57.048
I'm an analyst.

21:57.050 --> 21:58.582
So, you're smart?

22:00.686 --> 22:02.386
I like smart guys.

22:03.889 --> 22:05.990
Paige:
Don't-don't-don't freeze.

22:05.992 --> 22:08.626
Slowly move your fingers
back and forth.

22:08.628 --> 22:10.328
Slow down.

22:10.330 --> 22:11.862
Just let her know you're there.

22:14.099 --> 22:15.900
Perfect.

22:15.902 --> 22:17.068
Hold her gaze.

22:17.070 --> 22:18.369
And look at her like you want

22:18.371 --> 22:19.403
To know everything

22:19.405 --> 22:21.038
There is to know about her.

22:21.040 --> 22:23.874
Look at her
like you've never known

22:23.876 --> 22:25.042
A woman like her before

22:25.044 --> 22:27.645
And never will again.

22:27.647 --> 22:29.380
Tell her...

22:29.382 --> 22:31.749
From the moment you saw her

22:31.751 --> 22:34.485
Your definition
of "stunning" changed.

22:34.487 --> 22:37.888
You know, from the
moment I saw you...

22:37.890 --> 22:41.859
My definition of
"stunning" changed.

22:41.861 --> 22:43.661
Perfect.

22:43.663 --> 22:45.596
What's taking so long? Open it.

22:45.598 --> 22:48.065
I can't. She booby-trapped it.

22:48.067 --> 22:50.368
We open this,
an alarm will notify her.

22:50.370 --> 22:51.702
We have no other way in.

22:51.704 --> 22:52.870
Actually, we do.

22:52.872 --> 22:54.939
Come on.

23:00.946 --> 23:02.146
The gecko gloves from the cia?

23:02.148 --> 23:04.448
She gave me those, too.

23:04.450 --> 23:06.484
I'm charming like that.

23:15.994 --> 23:17.795
Huh.

23:19.164 --> 23:20.865
It's a full moon out tonight.

23:20.867 --> 23:22.967
Not funny.

23:22.969 --> 23:25.169
You know, you look hot.

23:25.171 --> 23:28.005
Off of you?
She wants to search your jacket

23:28.007 --> 23:30.174
For the access card.

23:30.176 --> 23:31.776
You need to stall.

23:31.778 --> 23:33.043
Do it.

23:33.045 --> 23:34.445
Yeah, why not?

23:35.814 --> 23:37.648
Beautiful jacket. Yes.

23:40.819 --> 23:42.787
You know, on second thought...

23:42.789 --> 23:44.822
Do you want to get out of here?

23:44.824 --> 23:46.490
Oh, you want to go
to another bar?

23:46.492 --> 23:49.960
Paige:
She means upstairs, walter.

23:49.962 --> 23:52.897
You know, I never...
Do this.

23:52.899 --> 23:55.433
Maybe it's the drink,
I don't know, but...

23:55.435 --> 23:57.968
I'm just going
to say how I feel.

23:57.970 --> 24:00.538
I want you
to come to my room.

24:00.540 --> 24:02.206
She thinks the card's
in his pants.

24:02.208 --> 24:03.908
And those pants
won't stay on long.

24:03.910 --> 24:05.042
Happy! Toby!

24:05.044 --> 24:06.444
Where the hell are you?

24:06.446 --> 24:08.546
Happy's climbing up
the side of the building

24:08.548 --> 24:10.614
To sima's room right now.

24:13.752 --> 24:14.952
Hurry up!

24:14.954 --> 24:16.487
I'm sorry.

24:16.489 --> 24:17.721
Am I not scaling the building

24:17.723 --> 24:20.991
By hand fast enough for you?

24:20.993 --> 24:22.760
Where's happy?

24:24.095 --> 24:25.529
Oh, god...

24:28.467 --> 24:30.201
Happy!
Aah! No, no,

24:30.203 --> 24:31.135
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

24:31.137 --> 24:32.570
Happy?

24:32.572 --> 24:34.171
The stupid glove
stopped sticking!

24:34.173 --> 24:36.607
You know your little girlfriend
at the cia

24:36.609 --> 24:37.975
Who designs this stuff?

24:37.977 --> 24:39.810
Yeah.
Yeah, she sucks!

24:42.147 --> 24:43.647
Oh, not good.

24:50.255 --> 24:52.623
Come on, man.
Toby: Sylvester?

24:52.625 --> 24:54.191
We have got to catch
her if she falls.

24:54.193 --> 24:56.193
From 30 feet?
She could kill us.

24:56.195 --> 24:59.163
Sylvester, think of something!
Okay, okay! The force of gravity

24:59.165 --> 25:00.931
Is 9.81 meters
per second squared.

25:00.933 --> 25:02.666
If she swings hard to her left,

25:02.668 --> 25:03.801
Then her right hand
would completely

25:03.803 --> 25:04.835
Disengage from the building.

25:04.837 --> 25:06.270
And for 2/10 of a second

25:06.272 --> 25:07.938
She won't be
attached to anything.

25:07.940 --> 25:10.608
But she can use that time
to get to the balcony...

25:10.610 --> 25:12.109
Or plummet to her death.

25:12.111 --> 25:14.144
Very reassuring!
Okay.

25:14.146 --> 25:17.214
If you get enough momentum,
it could work!

25:17.216 --> 25:20.818
It's 50/50!
It's natural to be scared.

25:20.820 --> 25:22.620
You should be scared!

25:22.622 --> 25:24.688
You're the one
who gave me these gloves!

25:24.690 --> 25:25.789
You're slipping!

25:25.791 --> 25:27.725
Do it now!

25:31.296 --> 25:32.563
Sylvester:
Ah...!

25:33.665 --> 25:35.666
How did she pull that off?

25:35.668 --> 25:39.203
'cause she's happy
frickin' quinn.

25:46.144 --> 25:48.879
Clock's ticking, happy.
What do you got?
Nothing.

25:48.881 --> 25:50.614
You better hurry.
They're in the elevator.

25:51.983 --> 25:53.918
Paige: Walter, happy's
in the room right now.

25:53.920 --> 25:54.718
You have to stall.

25:54.720 --> 25:56.954
Mm...

25:57.789 --> 26:00.190
You're impatient.

26:00.192 --> 26:01.825
I like that.

26:01.827 --> 26:03.594
Mm...
Paige: Walter?

26:03.596 --> 26:05.896
Tell her there's another woman
that you care about.

26:05.898 --> 26:08.766
Listen, there's, um,

26:08.768 --> 26:10.234
There's this other woman...

26:10.236 --> 26:12.836
And, um, what you and I

26:12.838 --> 26:14.838
Are about to do
could complicate

26:14.840 --> 26:18.142
An already complicated
situation.

26:19.911 --> 26:23.013
Marvin, let me assure you,

26:23.015 --> 26:24.748
What you and I are about to do

26:24.750 --> 26:27.685
Will be the least complicated
thing you'll ever experience.

26:30.355 --> 26:32.790
Okay.

26:32.792 --> 26:34.358
Uh, how much longer do I have?

26:35.193 --> 26:36.827
Two minutes. Tops.

26:37.929 --> 26:38.996
There are no cameras
in the room.

26:38.998 --> 26:40.331
Fill me in.
What are you doing?

26:43.301 --> 26:44.835
I'm checking her stuff.

26:44.837 --> 26:47.371
There might be a secret hollow
or something.

26:47.373 --> 26:49.206
Just leave everything
the way you found it.

26:49.208 --> 26:50.774
They're stepping off
the elevator.

26:53.244 --> 26:56.347
I just found a key
for a lock-ur-stuff facility.

26:57.315 --> 26:59.083
Now, why would
an international spy

26:59.085 --> 27:02.353
Who's always traveling the world
rent a storage facility?

27:02.355 --> 27:04.088
'cause maybe that's where
she's keeping the chemicals.

27:04.090 --> 27:05.656
Happy, get the hell
out of there!

27:06.224 --> 27:07.758
And, uh, how do I do that?

27:07.760 --> 27:09.927
The gloves are useless.
I'm not spiderwoman.

27:12.230 --> 27:14.231
They're coming down the hall!
They're almost there!

27:14.233 --> 27:16.700
Hide now!
Uh, where?

27:16.702 --> 27:18.035
And do not tell me
under the bed,

27:18.037 --> 27:19.236
(door opening)
because that's the worst...

27:19.238 --> 27:21.038
Happy still hasn't
gotten out, walter.

27:21.040 --> 27:23.107
You can't let her in.
You need to do something!

27:25.310 --> 27:26.910
Think fast!
Oh, no...

27:26.912 --> 27:28.379
Something wrong?

27:28.381 --> 27:30.080
Yes.

27:35.353 --> 27:38.088
Oh, my god.

27:38.090 --> 27:39.790
That is a humdinger.

27:51.903 --> 27:53.270
Happy: I'm out! Where's
the closest lock-ur-stuff?

27:53.272 --> 27:56.373
Two blocks away.
You and toby are with me.

27:56.375 --> 27:59.810
Keep your eyes on walter
and help him distract sima

27:59.812 --> 28:01.445
Until we get those chemicals.

28:01.447 --> 28:03.313
I'm not sure he needs any help.

28:03.315 --> 28:05.015
I hate to disagree, but
she's not that into it.

28:05.017 --> 28:06.083
No hands on the back
of the head.

28:06.085 --> 28:07.251
No fingers through the hair.

28:07.253 --> 28:09.887
Maybe walter's a bad kisser.

28:09.889 --> 28:11.855
Okay, let's go.

28:11.857 --> 28:14.358
Hold down the fort, kid.
We'll be back in five.

28:14.360 --> 28:18.195
I'm going to go slip into
something less constricting.

28:18.197 --> 28:21.265
No bedroom, walter.
Ha-happy wasn't able

28:21.267 --> 28:22.433
To put everything back.

28:22.435 --> 28:24.334
If sima sees,
your cover's blown.

28:24.336 --> 28:27.871
There's no point.

28:27.873 --> 28:30.841
Whatever you put on,
you'll be out of it

28:30.843 --> 28:32.142
In a matter of minutes.

28:32.144 --> 28:33.844
Oh...

28:33.846 --> 28:36.914
Paige: Tell her you want her
on the couch.

28:38.349 --> 28:39.783
I want you on the couch.

28:39.785 --> 28:41.418
Sima:
Mmm!

28:41.420 --> 28:43.153
Tell her you can't wait
to have her.

28:43.155 --> 28:45.089
I can't wait to have you.
But first...

28:45.091 --> 28:46.457
Tell her you want to order

28:46.459 --> 28:48.058
Champagne from room service.

28:48.060 --> 28:50.260
What? No.

28:50.262 --> 28:51.962
What do you mean "no"?
Uh, what?

28:51.964 --> 28:53.330
Nothing.
Just, uh... You know...

28:53.332 --> 28:54.331
You...

28:54.333 --> 28:55.332
Oh...!

28:55.334 --> 28:56.967
...Just need to sit there

28:56.969 --> 28:58.769
And watch.

29:00.371 --> 29:03.173
97% certain sure I just heard
an extended zipper pull.

29:03.175 --> 29:04.842
Most likely a dress.

29:04.844 --> 29:06.443
Thank you, sylvester.

29:06.445 --> 29:07.478
You're welcome.

29:13.051 --> 29:15.486
You will never forget
this night.

29:15.488 --> 29:17.354
Paige:
Say...

29:17.356 --> 29:19.223
"I've wanted to be with you

29:19.225 --> 29:21.492
Since the moment
I laid eyes on you."

29:21.494 --> 29:24.294
I... I love hearing

29:24.296 --> 29:25.796
Your voice in my ear.

29:25.798 --> 29:26.463
Thank you.

29:26.465 --> 29:28.465
Thank you.

29:43.047 --> 29:44.381
Happy:
Careful.

29:44.383 --> 29:46.416
She might've
booby-trapped this thing.

29:49.854 --> 29:52.422
Yup. This is the stuff.

29:52.424 --> 29:54.458
We got a problem.
Look at that.

29:56.027 --> 29:58.195
It's a pressure alarm.

29:58.197 --> 29:59.396
Not good?

29:59.398 --> 30:01.565
Definitely not good.

30:02.534 --> 30:04.535
(alarm beeping)
hmm?

30:04.537 --> 30:05.969
What's that?

30:05.971 --> 30:07.437
Oh, nothing.

30:07.439 --> 30:08.572
It's just an alarm.

30:08.574 --> 30:10.407
I can never
get it set right.

30:10.409 --> 30:11.942
That is a strange watch

30:11.944 --> 30:15.045
To be outfitted with
modern electronics.

30:21.219 --> 30:24.588
Paige:
Walter? Walter?

30:24.590 --> 30:26.890
Walter, say something!

30:40.038 --> 30:42.206
(groans)

30:51.616 --> 30:55.419
Now that our relationship
has evolved,

30:55.421 --> 30:58.055
Maybe you should tell me
your real name.

30:58.057 --> 31:00.557
I've already told
you my name, fatima.

31:00.559 --> 31:02.593
That's not my real name, either.

31:02.595 --> 31:03.994
Are we going somewhere?

31:03.996 --> 31:05.562
I'm going home.

31:05.564 --> 31:07.631
And if your associates
can follow my directions,

31:07.633 --> 31:09.366
So are you.

31:09.368 --> 31:11.101
I don't have any associates.

31:11.103 --> 31:13.170
No?

31:14.138 --> 31:16.607
While you were sleeping,
we made a deal.

31:16.609 --> 31:20.277
They bring me the two canisters
from my storage facilities,

31:20.279 --> 31:22.279
And leonard gets the third
from the cia lab.

31:22.281 --> 31:25.449
They give <i>me</i>
<i>all three chemicals,</i>

31:25.451 --> 31:27.451
I let you go.

31:27.453 --> 31:29.453
Everybody wins.

31:29.455 --> 31:30.988
And they're coming here?

31:30.990 --> 31:32.522
You'd better hope so.

31:42.934 --> 31:44.034
Happy:
Got it.

31:44.036 --> 31:46.937
Tail number: N888c41.

31:46.939 --> 31:49.439
Are we sure this is
a good idea?
You got a better one?

31:49.441 --> 31:51.241
It's better than handing over
latent chemical weapons

31:51.243 --> 31:53.010
To an anti-american agent?

31:53.012 --> 31:54.411
Give me a minute.

31:54.413 --> 31:56.413
If we don't give her
what she wants, walter dies.

31:56.415 --> 31:58.916
We got to do whatever we can
to get him off that plane.

31:58.918 --> 32:02.953
She'll keep him as collateral
to get out of american airspace.

32:05.056 --> 32:06.423
It's time to get our man.

32:15.266 --> 32:17.034
Welcome aboard.

32:22.006 --> 32:22.706
Where's leonard?

32:22.708 --> 32:25.008
Uh, we didn't need him.

32:25.010 --> 32:26.243
The cia gave us
the third chemical.

32:26.245 --> 32:28.578
There's all three chemicals
in the satchel.

32:28.580 --> 32:30.147
They're the real thing.

32:30.149 --> 32:32.115
There's a litmus test
in there to prove it.

32:33.985 --> 32:35.218
(unzipping satchel)

32:36.654 --> 32:38.722
Let's go, buddy.

32:38.724 --> 32:40.958
Uncuff him.

32:40.960 --> 32:43.360
New plan-- once we've landed
safely in neutral territory,

32:43.362 --> 32:45.662
He'll be released.

32:45.664 --> 32:47.564
We had a deal.
Yes.

32:47.566 --> 32:50.334
And the deal was leonard was
supposed to come with you.

32:50.336 --> 32:53.337
How? Leonard's on his way
to a federal penitentiary.

32:55.006 --> 32:56.373
She has an emotional
connection with him.

32:56.375 --> 32:57.374
She knows you
could have gotten

32:57.376 --> 32:58.709
The chemicals
without leonard,

32:58.711 --> 33:00.544
She only wants him here
because she loves him.

33:01.412 --> 33:02.746
Cabe:
You uncuff my man...

33:03.748 --> 33:06.016
...And I'll work out a deal
for you for leonard.

33:06.018 --> 33:07.184
You are a liar.

33:09.020 --> 33:10.687
Cabe!

33:10.689 --> 33:12.022
Ah...
Oh, my god,

33:12.024 --> 33:13.757
That was a muzzle flash!
Look!

33:19.063 --> 33:20.097
Let's go.

33:26.104 --> 33:28.071
Toby:
Cabe! Cabe, are you all right?!

33:28.073 --> 33:30.474
Cabe! Cabe!

33:32.076 --> 33:35.579
Damn glad she gave you
this shirt.

33:35.581 --> 33:37.781
But right now,
we gotta figure out

33:37.783 --> 33:40.417
How to stop that plane,
or walter's as good as dead.

33:40.419 --> 33:41.752
I got an idea.

33:57.035 --> 33:59.503
â™ª

34:07.311 --> 34:09.379
(hissing)

34:15.319 --> 34:16.720
What the hell are you doing?

34:26.631 --> 34:30.067
Walter,
what did you do?

34:50.188 --> 34:53.156
(sighs, grunts)

34:54.559 --> 34:56.560
(engine cranking)
come on, come on, come on.

34:56.562 --> 35:00.697
100 miles an hour,
147 feet per second,

35:00.699 --> 35:02.199
Which means they're gonna
run out of runway.

35:02.201 --> 35:03.400
(engine starts)
got it!

35:15.346 --> 35:17.414
Oh... My god.

35:28.326 --> 35:30.393
Hey!
Walter!

35:30.395 --> 35:31.795
Hey!

35:31.797 --> 35:33.663
Jump! We'll catch you!

35:33.665 --> 35:36.199
If the chemicals blow up,
they will combine

35:36.201 --> 35:38.268
And aerosol,
and kill people for miles!

35:38.270 --> 35:40.203
Get ready!
Walter, no!

35:40.205 --> 35:41.771
Do not throw me
deadly chemicals!

35:41.773 --> 35:44.174
One, two, three!

35:44.909 --> 35:46.610
Oh! God...!

35:46.612 --> 35:48.678
(thudding down stairs)

35:51.349 --> 35:52.415
Nice catch, sly!

35:52.417 --> 35:53.884
(groans aggressively)

35:53.886 --> 35:55.886
Hey, man, if that fire
hits the fuel tank,

35:55.888 --> 35:58.288
The whole plane's gonna blow--
you got to jump, walter!

35:58.290 --> 36:00.157
I know! Hold on!

36:00.159 --> 36:01.725
We got you, buddy, come on!
Come on.

36:01.727 --> 36:03.393
Toby:
Walter!

36:11.435 --> 36:13.637
(jet engines revving up)

36:21.379 --> 36:22.512
(grunts, yells)

36:24.182 --> 36:25.949
(sima groaning)

36:28.419 --> 36:29.352
(electrical crackling stops)

36:31.355 --> 36:32.589
Toby:
Walter!

36:32.591 --> 36:34.491
Jump!
Okay!

36:37.328 --> 36:38.662
Be careful!

36:45.536 --> 36:46.870
Okay, okay!

36:46.872 --> 36:47.904
Walter!

36:55.446 --> 36:57.347
Get me up!

36:57.349 --> 37:00.717
(grunting, yelling)

37:00.719 --> 37:02.786
You're all right.

37:08.492 --> 37:10.694
(siren wailing)

37:10.696 --> 37:12.362
Sylvester:
Cabe said sima will make it.

37:12.364 --> 37:14.731
Maybe she and leonard will be
in adjoining penitentiaries.

37:14.733 --> 37:16.733
So she loved him.

37:16.735 --> 37:18.368
It's not logical.

37:18.370 --> 37:20.670
It's called
the wiseman effect.

37:20.672 --> 37:22.672
If you pretend you're
in love with someone,

37:22.674 --> 37:24.574
Sometimes you actually
start to believe it.

37:24.576 --> 37:26.443
That's why she wouldn't
really kiss you back.

37:26.445 --> 37:28.945
Heart belongs
to leonard.

37:28.947 --> 37:33.283
The good news is that you're
probably not as bad a kisser

37:33.285 --> 37:34.551
As I theorized.

37:34.553 --> 37:36.553
She had the chance
to get away,

37:36.555 --> 37:39.723
But she gave it up for love,
for something that's not real.

37:41.492 --> 37:42.559
It <i>was</i> real to her.

37:42.561 --> 37:46.529
â™ª

37:53.371 --> 37:55.672
I'm gonna write you a script
for antibiotics, too.

37:55.674 --> 37:57.407
Why I'm doing that, ralph?

37:57.409 --> 37:59.876
'cause burns cover
more surface area than cuts,

37:59.878 --> 38:01.311
So more easily infected.

38:01.313 --> 38:02.379
A-plus.

38:05.016 --> 38:07.017
(both laughing)

38:07.019 --> 38:08.685
Jumping out
of a burning plane.

38:08.687 --> 38:10.020
Yeah.

38:10.022 --> 38:11.721
When did we become
action heroes?

38:11.723 --> 38:12.889
I have no idea.

38:12.891 --> 38:14.524
You're set.

38:14.526 --> 38:16.393
Thank you, pal.

38:16.395 --> 38:17.460
Mm-hmm.

38:18.729 --> 38:19.796
(groans)

38:20.765 --> 38:23.600
How about a story?

38:23.602 --> 38:24.668
Yes, please.
Yeah?

38:27.571 --> 38:29.572
<i>Robo-spies,</i>

38:29.574 --> 38:30.874
Issue one.

38:30.876 --> 38:33.877
"the dawn of a new breed
of secret agent:

38:33.879 --> 38:36.646
Half-spy, half-robot."

38:38.582 --> 38:40.917
"it was a dangerous time
for spies.

38:40.919 --> 38:42.385
"and human spies could

38:42.387 --> 38:44.487
"no longer do the mission.

38:44.489 --> 38:47.457
"their skin,
and their mortality,

38:47.459 --> 38:49.326
The way they thought..."

38:49.328 --> 38:51.461
I know my advice earlier
wasn't real helpful.

38:51.463 --> 38:53.530
Uh, let's try this.

38:55.466 --> 38:58.335
The most important thing
to sima, or whatever
her name was,

38:58.337 --> 39:00.470
Was getting those chemicals
and making the nerve gas

39:00.472 --> 39:02.038
And bringing it
back to her country.

39:02.040 --> 39:04.574
And she was on the
verge of achieving it.

39:04.576 --> 39:06.509
And then she threw it
all away for love.

39:06.511 --> 39:09.512
Love can make you stupid.

39:09.514 --> 39:11.514
(chuckles)

39:11.516 --> 39:13.917
The question is-- what's
your most important thing?

39:16.387 --> 39:17.654
Ralph.

39:17.656 --> 39:19.656
Then this is my advice:

39:19.658 --> 39:21.658
Whatever thoughts
you're having about drew

39:21.660 --> 39:23.660
Or anyone else...

39:23.662 --> 39:27.397
You ask yourself,
"could this hurt ralph?"

39:27.399 --> 39:30.467
And take care of your
most important thing.

39:38.576 --> 39:40.577
Huh, still here?

39:40.579 --> 39:41.711
Uh, faa--
you blow up one plane,

39:41.713 --> 39:43.012
And the paperwork's
mind-boggling.

39:43.014 --> 39:44.547
(chuckles)

39:44.549 --> 39:45.548
Where are you off to?

39:45.550 --> 39:47.851
Ucla research lab.

39:47.853 --> 39:48.852
It's almost midnight.

39:48.854 --> 39:50.720
Yeah, I know, I'm late.

39:50.722 --> 39:51.955
Don't work too much longer.

39:51.957 --> 39:54.491
So, uh, pretty nuts--

39:54.493 --> 39:56.826
A trained spy gets caught
because of love.

39:56.828 --> 39:58.428
That's silly, huh?

39:58.430 --> 40:01.798
The notion of romantic love
is a fairy tale.

40:01.800 --> 40:03.666
The thought that people
can be affected

40:03.668 --> 40:07.437
In some meaningful way by the
affection of others is... Is...

40:07.439 --> 40:09.439
Kiss, touch...

40:09.441 --> 40:10.907
Uh, the, uh...

40:10.909 --> 40:13.710
Whatever, it's, um...

40:13.712 --> 40:14.844
It's junk science.

40:14.846 --> 40:16.913
It's not even that.

40:16.915 --> 40:18.715
Yeah.

40:18.717 --> 40:20.049
Like I said, silly.

40:22.887 --> 40:23.987
Okay.

40:23.989 --> 40:27.090
As my mother used to say,
sweet dreams.

40:27.092 --> 40:29.092
Oh, paige.

40:29.094 --> 40:32.562
Can you, uh, record a new
outgoing message on the machine?

40:32.564 --> 40:33.596
Sure.
