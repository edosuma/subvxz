WEBVTT

00:02.800 --> 00:03.858
Mmm.

00:08.372 --> 00:10.533
<i>Necesito un bueno</i> worker.

00:10.608 --> 00:12.337
<i>Tu es fuerte.</i> Come on.

00:21.151 --> 00:22.277
We don't go with that man.

00:22.353 --> 00:24.947
I've seen several men go with
that man and none come back.

00:26.423 --> 00:27.481
We've lost friends...

00:28.859 --> 00:30.520
We don't know what
he does with them.

00:32.563 --> 00:34.053
I don't wanna talk
about it anymore.

00:35.266 --> 00:36.494
I pick up day laborers

00:36.567 --> 00:38.467
and tell them that
they'll get paid at 6:00 p.m.

00:38.903 --> 00:41.633
At 5:45, a certain
I.N.S. Agent,

00:41.705 --> 00:43.502
by the name of Mose Schrute,

00:43.574 --> 00:45.132
throws them in
the back of a van,

00:45.209 --> 00:46.733
drops them off in
the middle of Harrisburg

00:46.810 --> 00:48.903
and tells them it's Canada.

00:51.248 --> 00:52.806
<i>Tu es un bueno</i> worker?

00:52.883 --> 00:54.544
<i>Si. Yo muy bueno</i> worker.

00:54.685 --> 00:57.153
<i>Yel acento...</i>
<i>Donde</i> are you from?

00:57.254 --> 00:58.551
Scranton.

00:58.689 --> 01:01.453
<i>Y... before that,
<i>la</i> Philadelphia.</i>

01:01.625 --> 01:02.990
You speak English?
Yes.

01:03.060 --> 01:04.652
I'm really good at English.
Okay, good, me too.

01:04.727 --> 01:06.286
Get in the car.
Okay.

01:08.465 --> 01:10.296
Who is this guy
by our cars?

01:10.401 --> 01:12.631
That is my new
maintenance worker, Nate,

01:12.703 --> 01:14.466
and you'll be happy to know
that he's taking care of

01:14.538 --> 01:16.733
that hornet's nest
that you've
been griping about.

01:17.241 --> 01:18.674
Yeah. I got stung
up my dress.

01:18.742 --> 01:19.936
Poor hornet.

01:20.010 --> 01:21.841
I've left him all
the tools he needs.

01:21.912 --> 01:23.277
This is do or die.

01:23.347 --> 01:25.076
If he chooses correctly,
he'll conquer the hornets.

01:25.149 --> 01:26.810
And if he doesn't?

01:28.085 --> 01:29.074
He'll die.

01:29.286 --> 01:30.719
What?
Beg your pardon?

01:30.788 --> 01:32.847
DWIGHT: When did the phrase
"do or die"
become so corrupted?

01:33.023 --> 01:34.820
KELLY: Is that
a blowtorch?
No.

01:34.892 --> 01:37.725
No, no, no! No, no!

01:37.795 --> 01:39.422
DWIGHT: Interesting choice.

01:39.496 --> 01:40.758
PAM: Yes.

01:40.965 --> 01:41.954
ANDY: Very, very smart.

01:42.032 --> 01:43.021
PAM: Walking away.

01:43.667 --> 01:44.656
No! No, no, no!

01:44.735 --> 01:45.724
The bat.

01:45.936 --> 01:46.960
PAM: What is he doing?

01:47.037 --> 01:48.698
ANDY: Oh!
They're stinging him!

01:48.772 --> 01:49.966
ALL: No, no, no!

01:50.074 --> 01:51.268
No, no!

02:15.065 --> 02:17.829
Good morning, Erin.
Any mustaches,
I mean messages?

02:18.469 --> 02:20.027
Terrific.

02:20.437 --> 02:22.064
MICHAEL:
<i>There are many reasons</i>

02:22.139 --> 02:24.198
<i>a man would wear</i>
<i>a fake mustache to work.</i>

02:24.942 --> 02:26.375
He is a fan

02:26.443 --> 02:27.910
of the outrageous.

02:27.978 --> 02:29.070
He loves to

02:29.146 --> 02:30.408
surprise!

02:31.148 --> 02:34.276
He loves other things
as well.

02:35.386 --> 02:36.375
Wow.

02:40.824 --> 02:41.813
Okay.

02:43.460 --> 02:45.360
 It's a pimple,
Phyllis.

02:45.429 --> 02:46.828
Avril Lavigne gets
them all the time,

02:46.897 --> 02:48.524
and she rocks
harder than anyone alive.

02:48.966 --> 02:50.661
That's no pimple, Michael.

02:51.068 --> 02:52.228
You mean cancer?

02:52.403 --> 02:54.701
What? No way. No.
Definitely not.
Not cancer.

02:54.872 --> 02:56.965
It's just good to catch
a Michael train
of thought early

02:57.074 --> 02:59.372
before it derails
and destroys
the entire town.

03:00.310 --> 03:01.299
MEREDITH: Wait, wait, wait.

03:01.378 --> 03:02.504
It's just a cold sore.

03:02.579 --> 03:03.603
It is?

03:03.681 --> 03:05.478
Yup, just a cold sore.
Just a cold sore.

03:05.549 --> 03:07.710
Thank you. Phyllis,
I don't have acne.

03:07.785 --> 03:09.753
I have a cold sore.
I didn't even have a cold.

03:10.087 --> 03:11.111
I don't know how I got it.

03:11.188 --> 03:12.382
I know how you got it.

03:12.456 --> 03:13.514
How?

03:13.590 --> 03:14.784
Michael, come on.

03:15.025 --> 03:16.890
A cold sore is herpes.

03:17.428 --> 03:19.293
What?
What you should do,
Michael,

03:19.363 --> 03:20.625
is have a doctor
take a look at it,

03:20.698 --> 03:21.995
'cause we don't
really know what that is.

03:22.199 --> 03:24.895
I know tons and tons
of people who have herpes.

03:25.069 --> 03:26.366
I have it myself.

03:26.437 --> 03:27.426
That's what it is.

03:27.504 --> 03:28.937
I've never seen
herpes on you.

03:29.006 --> 03:30.633
'Cause it's on
my genitals, genius.

03:31.008 --> 03:32.168
You have a penis?

03:32.409 --> 03:34.707
Michael, have you ever
been tested for STDs?

03:34.845 --> 03:36.870
Yeah, my last physical
when I was 40.

03:37.448 --> 03:38.540
That was, like,
<i>10 years ago.</i>

03:38.615 --> 03:39.843
No, it was, like,
four years ago.

03:39.950 --> 03:41.577
Michael,
you're at least 46.

03:41.652 --> 03:42.641
Why "at least"?

03:42.720 --> 03:45.120
If you're guessing 46,
just say 46.

03:52.996 --> 03:55.362
Can we please talk about
how gross Meredith is?

03:56.066 --> 03:57.226
This is what you get

03:57.301 --> 03:59.269
when you treat your
body like an outhouse.

04:00.437 --> 04:01.461
ANDY: You know what, guys?

04:01.538 --> 04:03.836
How about we just
chill out a little bit
on the herp chat?

04:04.241 --> 04:05.970
Okay? I was
an R.A. In college,

04:06.043 --> 04:07.135
and I can tell you,

04:07.211 --> 04:08.906
the number one sexually
transmitted disease

04:10.714 --> 04:12.181
is ignorance.

04:12.382 --> 04:15.180
I guess maybe she
could marry a
meth dealer with crabs...

04:15.252 --> 04:16.879
I don't even want
to know about these things.

04:16.954 --> 04:18.113
Hey, guys.

04:25.362 --> 04:27.057
How did this happen?
How did I get this?

04:27.131 --> 04:29.326
Sometimes it can lie dormant
in a woman for years.

04:29.399 --> 04:30.730
They may not even
know that they have it.

04:30.801 --> 04:32.200
You know what?
I feel like

04:32.269 --> 04:33.497
one of those
old-timey sailors with VD.

04:34.638 --> 04:36.538
Eh, it's me own darn fault.

04:36.607 --> 04:38.336
Girl in every port!
What port?

04:38.909 --> 04:40.376
The Jan port?

04:41.011 --> 04:42.672
The Holly port?
Don't even...

04:42.980 --> 04:44.538
Holly was clean, okay?

04:44.615 --> 04:46.480
If anything,
I gave it to her.

04:46.550 --> 04:48.040
You may have.
Oh, my God.

04:48.118 --> 04:49.142
What if I did?

04:49.219 --> 04:51.244
You need to contact Holly.

04:51.321 --> 04:54.313
You need to notify her that
she is crawling with herpes.

04:54.458 --> 04:55.925
Okay. You know what?

04:55.993 --> 04:57.017
Might.

04:57.094 --> 04:59.654
Might be crawling with herpes.

05:01.031 --> 05:02.589
I might have
gotten it after her.

05:02.666 --> 05:04.725
You need to contact
every woman you've been with

05:04.802 --> 05:06.827
and notify them of
your herpes infestation.

05:07.204 --> 05:08.364
It's the right thing to do.

05:08.772 --> 05:10.262
There's no way
I'm gonna do that.

05:10.507 --> 05:11.531
Then I will.

05:11.608 --> 05:12.700
All right, I...

05:14.578 --> 05:16.375
Now, I'm no doctor,
but it seems to me

05:16.446 --> 05:18.471
that we all have an obligation
to the public health

05:18.549 --> 05:20.915
to track down anyone
who gives us a disease,

05:20.984 --> 05:22.281
inform them of it,

05:22.352 --> 05:24.547
and take overwhelming revenge
on that person.

05:25.022 --> 05:26.819
Again, I'm no doctor.

05:26.924 --> 05:29.017
I'm just a normal guy
who enjoys revenge.

05:31.528 --> 05:32.688
DONNA: <i>Hello.</i>

05:33.397 --> 05:34.728
Hi, Donna. It's Michael.

05:35.065 --> 05:36.965
<i>Michael.</i> I <i>didn't</i>
<i>think I'd hear from you.</i>

05:37.267 --> 05:38.291
<i>How've you been?</i>

05:38.368 --> 05:39.801
I have a disease

05:40.470 --> 05:42.097
for which there
is no known cure

05:42.172 --> 05:44.697
that has been
sexually transmitted to me.

05:45.242 --> 05:46.436
<i>Oh, no!</i>

05:46.877 --> 05:48.208
I can't even say it.

05:48.278 --> 05:50.405
H-I

05:50.480 --> 05:51.469
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

05:51.548 --> 05:56.850
R-P-E-E-S.

05:56.920 --> 06:00.754
<i>Wait. You're calling to tell</i>
<i>me that you have herpes?</i>

06:00.824 --> 06:04.851
No. I am calling to see
if you gave me herpes,

06:04.962 --> 06:06.623
because if you did,

06:06.697 --> 06:08.892
I would be able to avoid
a lot of sucky conversations.

06:10.033 --> 06:11.898
So you have it, right?
<i>No.</i>

06:12.269 --> 06:13.566
Does your stupid
husband have it?

06:13.637 --> 06:15.002
<i>No, he doesn't.</i>

06:15.072 --> 06:16.733
<i>Are you telling me</i>
I <i>have to get tested?</i>

06:17.007 --> 06:18.975
Yes, I'm telling you
you have to get
tested for herpes.

06:19.042 --> 06:20.509
Good-bye!
So long, Donna.

06:20.878 --> 06:23.608
Excuse me, everyone,
can I have your attention,
please?

06:23.680 --> 06:24.704
Not again.

06:24.781 --> 06:25.770
What do you mean "again"?

06:25.849 --> 06:27.749
You're always
asking for our attention.

06:27.918 --> 06:29.215
Well, maybe like a year ago.

06:29.286 --> 06:30.480
Mmm. Seems recent.

06:30.554 --> 06:31.851
No, that's...

06:31.922 --> 06:34.015
Andy, the reason
it seems more recent

06:34.091 --> 06:36.059
is because many of us here
have never stood up

06:36.126 --> 06:37.593
and asked for
everyone's attention,

06:37.794 --> 06:39.887
and it seems like
you've done it
on several occasions.

06:39.963 --> 06:41.760
Everyone, I've noticed that

06:41.832 --> 06:44.630
we've not been entirely
kind to one of our own,

06:45.135 --> 06:47.160
due to stigmas
and prejudices.

06:47.237 --> 06:48.829
Oh! When you got
your new phone,

06:48.906 --> 06:50.396
that's when you asked
for everyone's attention.

06:50.474 --> 06:51.532
STANLEY: World Cup.
That's what I was thinking.

06:51.608 --> 06:52.597
OSCAR: That's right.

06:52.676 --> 06:54.507
You kept announcing scores.

06:54.711 --> 06:56.804
It's the world's only
international sport, so...

06:59.182 --> 07:00.615
<i>This is Holly.</i>

07:02.085 --> 07:03.746
No, this is Holly.

07:05.188 --> 07:07.088
<i>No, this is Holly.</i>

07:07.658 --> 07:09.319
No, this is Holly.

07:09.526 --> 07:11.460
<i>No... This is Michael Scott.</i>

07:13.196 --> 07:14.390
Busted.

07:16.433 --> 07:17.764
So, what can I
do for you, Holly?

07:17.834 --> 07:19.699
<i>I'm calling because</i>

07:19.937 --> 07:21.199
<i>there was</i>
<i>a terrible car accident.</i>

07:21.805 --> 07:23.739
Oh, really?
Was anyone killed?

07:24.341 --> 07:25.933
A <i>lot of people.</i>

07:26.009 --> 07:27.306
Any nuns?

07:27.377 --> 07:28.605
<i>Three nuns.</i>

07:29.146 --> 07:31.444
<i>Missionaries</i>
<i>from South Africa.</i>

07:31.815 --> 07:34.079
Were they in
the missionary position?

07:35.585 --> 07:37.883
<i>Hot pizza, check it and see</i>

07:39.056 --> 07:41.422
I <i>got a whole</i>
<i>Bunch of pepperoni</i>

07:41.491 --> 07:43.618
Yeah.
Now you're looking at me.

07:43.961 --> 07:45.553
Anyone who's interested
in entering into

07:45.629 --> 07:48.291
an honest discussion
about the sexual
mores and taboos

07:48.365 --> 07:51.892
of modern society
will be rewarded
with a pizza break.

07:52.502 --> 07:54.333
Do you ever wonder
what life would
have been like

07:54.404 --> 07:55.496
if you hadn't
been transferred?

07:56.573 --> 07:57.801
HOLLY: <i>Yeah.</i>

07:57.874 --> 07:59.034
We would have twins.

07:59.509 --> 08:00.999
I <i>don't think</i>
<i>we'd have kids.</i>

08:01.078 --> 08:02.477
Mmm-hmm.
<i>We dated for a few weeks.</i>

08:02.713 --> 08:04.681
Mmm-mmm.
We would be married.

08:04.948 --> 08:07.815
<i>Michael, I've been</i>
<i>dating A.J. For a year</i>
<i>and a half now.</i>

08:08.151 --> 08:09.618
<i>You do this, you know?</i>

08:09.686 --> 08:10.710
Do what?

08:11.121 --> 08:13.021
<i>You romanticize things.</i>

08:13.490 --> 08:15.788
I don't romantici...

08:15.859 --> 08:16.848
No.

08:16.927 --> 08:17.951
<i>Michael, you cried</i>

08:18.028 --> 08:20.087
<i>at that tag line for</i>
<i>a movie you made up.</i>

08:20.731 --> 08:21.993
"He had no arms or legs.

08:22.065 --> 08:23.657
"He couldn't see,
hear or speak.

08:25.268 --> 08:26.735
"This is how he led a nation."

08:27.137 --> 08:28.934
<i>You made us out to be</i>
<i>more than we were.</i>

08:29.573 --> 08:31.200
Maybe we were
more than we were.

08:31.641 --> 08:33.631
I <i>don't know what</i>
<i>you're getting</i>
<i>so upset about.</i>

08:33.710 --> 08:35.735
<i>We had a fun fling</i>
<i>a long time ago.</i>

08:36.078 --> 08:37.876
<i>It's a good memory.</i>
Okay, all right.

08:37.948 --> 08:39.847
I gotta go.
<i>Michael...</i>

08:44.121 --> 08:45.520
 He forgot
to mention the herpes.

08:45.989 --> 08:47.820
It didn't come up
organically.

08:49.092 --> 08:51.322
...to accommodate
the suppliers.

08:51.528 --> 08:53.792
Gentlemen, nice to see you.
It'll be just a moment.

08:53.930 --> 08:55.659
If you could show them
into conference room B.

08:55.732 --> 08:56.721
The pharmaceutical company

08:56.800 --> 08:58.324
should be able
to accommodate us.

08:58.435 --> 09:00.630
How do I do it?
Raise my daughter,

09:00.704 --> 09:02.569
work as director of office
purchasing for this hospital

09:02.639 --> 09:04.539
and release an album
of Doris Day covers

09:04.608 --> 09:06.200
on my own label?

09:07.544 --> 09:08.909
If I knew,
I'd tell you.

09:08.979 --> 09:10.037
It's nice to see you
doing so well.

09:10.313 --> 09:11.337
Yeah, I'm really happy.

09:11.448 --> 09:14.383
Me and Astrid
against the world.
We're loving it.

09:14.618 --> 09:16.586
Yeah, so,
kind of the supermom.

09:16.653 --> 09:18.143
Bringing home the bacon.
Yeah.

09:18.221 --> 09:19.688
<i>Fry it up in a pan</i>

09:19.756 --> 09:21.121
<i>Never, never, never let you</i>

09:21.191 --> 09:22.215
<i>Forget you're a man</i>

09:23.393 --> 09:24.883
Love that commercial.

09:24.961 --> 09:26.861
I don't understand
the reference.

09:27.864 --> 09:29.058
Well,

09:29.266 --> 09:30.756
Michael, it was nice
to get your call.

09:30.834 --> 09:32.893
We had to come over
right away. It's urgent.
Okay.

09:32.969 --> 09:34.300
Michael has something
to tell you.
Shh.

09:34.371 --> 09:35.838
Are you gonna
keep me in suspense?

09:43.914 --> 09:44.938
Would you excuse us?

09:45.015 --> 09:46.004
Okay, I'm gonna

09:46.983 --> 09:47.972
head outta here.

09:48.051 --> 09:50.417
I know you have a lot
to talk about, okay?

09:50.887 --> 09:53.014
Is there an operating theater

09:53.090 --> 09:54.387
that's open to visitors?

09:54.458 --> 09:55.823
Never mind. I'll find it.

09:57.661 --> 09:59.424
He hasn't changed.
No.

10:00.097 --> 10:02.065
So, what couldn't wait?

10:03.533 --> 10:05.228
Am I the kind of person

10:05.302 --> 10:07.236
to misremember
our relationship

10:07.304 --> 10:09.101
as something more
than it was?

10:09.172 --> 10:10.161
Michael Scott,

10:10.240 --> 10:12.470
you are here
for a post-mortem.

10:12.809 --> 10:13.798
What?

10:14.177 --> 10:16.111
You wanna dig into
our relationship,

10:16.680 --> 10:18.978
go over it,
see what killed it.

10:20.450 --> 10:21.542
Okay.

10:22.819 --> 10:24.013
I'm in.

10:24.721 --> 10:26.279
So, guys,
I've been really bothered

10:26.356 --> 10:29.382
by the way certain people
are getting treated
around here.

10:29.459 --> 10:32.428
And I just think
as an office,
we're better than that.

10:32.662 --> 10:35.096
Okay, now, I'm gonna
show you a picture

10:35.932 --> 10:36.990
of genitalia.

10:38.168 --> 10:39.157
ANGELA: Andy.

10:39.970 --> 10:41.767
What, 'cause he's black?
Nope.

10:41.838 --> 10:43.100
It's 'cause it's genitalia.

10:43.173 --> 10:45.835
Perfectly normal genitalia,
Tuna.

10:46.376 --> 10:49.573
Now I'm gonna show you
another picture

10:49.646 --> 10:51.841
of perfectly normal
genitalia.

10:51.915 --> 10:53.280
Oh, my God!

10:53.683 --> 10:55.810
Am I blocking anybody?
Can everybody see?

10:55.886 --> 10:57.513
ANDY: Perfectly normal.
Big deal.

10:57.721 --> 10:59.689
Yeah, sure,
it's got some herpes on it.

11:00.724 --> 11:03.557
But you know what?
It's just as normal
as anyone else's.

11:04.661 --> 11:07.357
No. In the beginning,
we were not good.

11:07.631 --> 11:09.496
Well, there was a bit
of a learning curve

11:09.633 --> 11:11.362
in the conversation
department,

11:11.434 --> 11:13.095
but between the sheets,

11:13.170 --> 11:14.637
we were like
Jordan and Pippen.

11:14.905 --> 11:15.997
Well, if there was anything
exciting about it,

11:16.072 --> 11:17.937
it was because
we both knew
it was wrong.

11:18.275 --> 11:19.333
Because we worked together.

11:19.409 --> 11:20.433
No.

11:20.510 --> 11:22.375
Okay, imagine
there's a princess

11:22.779 --> 11:24.269
who falls for a guy
beneath her station,

11:24.347 --> 11:25.814
and the queen
doesn't like this at all.

11:25.916 --> 11:27.645
And the princess knows
that the queen
doesn't like it,

11:27.717 --> 11:29.150
and so it makes her
want to do it all the more

11:29.219 --> 11:30.208
just to get at the queen.

11:31.454 --> 11:33.149
Am I the princess?
No, I'm the princess.

11:33.223 --> 11:34.713
And the queen.

11:34.824 --> 11:36.621
 Okay.
So I'm the guy
at the station.

11:38.562 --> 11:39.551
ASTRID: Mommy!

11:39.829 --> 11:41.558
Assie! Oh!

11:41.631 --> 11:44.657
 <i>How was school?</i>

11:44.734 --> 11:45.723
<i>It was cool</i>

11:45.802 --> 11:48.327
<i>What did you learn?</i>

11:48.405 --> 11:49.702
<i>What did</i> I <i>learn?</i>

11:49.773 --> 11:52.264
<i>You might have learned</i>

11:52.342 --> 11:54.902
<i>Shapes, or blocks</i>

11:54.978 --> 11:57.344
<i>Or clocks, or colors</i>

11:57.414 --> 11:59.245
<i>Or you might have learned</i>

11:59.316 --> 12:02.444
<i>That we're</i> all
<i>sisters and brothers...</i>

12:02.519 --> 12:03.816
I have herpes.

12:03.887 --> 12:05.149
What? You...

12:06.022 --> 12:07.853
I used to think
that she was "the one."

12:08.658 --> 12:10.751
Or at least a "the one."

12:12.095 --> 12:13.790
And if I called
that one so wrong...

12:17.000 --> 12:20.128
Herpes, like all STDs,
is a consequence of sex.

12:20.203 --> 12:22.137
Can anyone else name
any other consequences?

12:22.839 --> 12:24.704
It feels unbelievable.

12:25.408 --> 12:27.171
Okay, I guess we can
make a pros column.

12:28.378 --> 12:29.367
"Feels..."

12:29.446 --> 12:30.811
KEVIN: "Unbelievable."

12:30.880 --> 12:31.938
Okay.

12:32.015 --> 12:34.506
The ability to
express love physically.

12:35.352 --> 12:37.149
It's a magical thing.

12:37.687 --> 12:39.052
ANDY: "Express love."
"Magical."

12:40.557 --> 12:41.956
It feels amazing.

12:42.225 --> 12:44.819
Um... Okay, is that different
from "feels unbelievable"?

12:45.161 --> 12:46.628
Yes.

12:46.696 --> 12:48.095
Then I will write it down.

12:48.765 --> 12:50.892
The feeling of pure risk.

12:51.001 --> 12:53.128
Creed, I had that
in the cons column,

12:54.037 --> 12:55.334
but...
It's thrilling.

12:55.672 --> 12:58.732
Okay. Then...

12:59.643 --> 13:00.871
We'll move that.

13:00.944 --> 13:02.605
"Thrill of risk."

13:02.679 --> 13:04.579
Andy, aren't there also
negatives to sex?

13:04.981 --> 13:06.505
Yes! Thank you.

13:06.916 --> 13:07.940
Such as...

13:08.018 --> 13:09.007
Unplanned pregnancy.

13:09.119 --> 13:10.780
Yes. Unplanned pregnancy.

13:10.887 --> 13:11.945
Like Jim and Pam, what?

13:12.022 --> 13:13.011
Hey.

13:13.123 --> 13:15.284
Just admit
that your baby
was a mistake.

13:15.358 --> 13:17.826
Whoa!
Hey, our baby
was not a mistake.

13:19.195 --> 13:20.856
She was a surprise.
Good.

13:21.031 --> 13:23.158
I'm sure
they don't regret
having that child.

13:23.233 --> 13:24.222
Let's move it to the pros.

13:24.301 --> 13:25.290
BOTH: Thank you.

13:25.368 --> 13:28.997
Okay. "Unplanned pregnancy,"
going in the pros column.

13:30.240 --> 13:32.003
Next up is Helene.

13:32.842 --> 13:34.833
You're gonna want to
make a left on Willow,

13:34.978 --> 13:36.809
which is a little ways away.

13:36.880 --> 13:37.869
I'll remind you.

13:37.947 --> 13:39.881
You know, I don't know
if I trust Jan's judgment.

13:39.983 --> 13:41.883
She...
Jan knows paper.

13:41.951 --> 13:43.816
No, not paper.
Relationships.

13:43.887 --> 13:45.878
To have the ability
to point out

13:45.955 --> 13:48.617
if a man is making
a bigger deal
out of something

13:48.692 --> 13:50.421
than is really there.
Wait, what Holly said?

13:50.527 --> 13:52.392
Yes! I don't...
Forget it, Michael.

13:52.729 --> 13:53.787
Today is about herpes.

13:53.863 --> 13:54.852
I know.

13:54.998 --> 13:57.091
Okay? Who gave it
to you, who has it...

13:57.167 --> 13:58.361
Right.
And who is going to pay.

13:58.435 --> 13:59.424
Okay.

13:59.502 --> 14:00.491
To answer your
question about Jan...

14:00.570 --> 14:02.003
No, Jan is insane.

14:02.072 --> 14:03.198
Why do you think I...

14:03.306 --> 14:04.432
Left! Willow, now!

14:04.507 --> 14:05.565
All right! God!

14:07.410 --> 14:08.877
Hi, stranger.

14:09.612 --> 14:10.670
Long time.

14:10.747 --> 14:11.736
Who are you?

14:12.115 --> 14:14.174
I'm Michael.
We dated for a while.

14:14.384 --> 14:15.612
I don't think so.

14:16.052 --> 14:17.280
Michael?

14:19.289 --> 14:20.722
Oh, hey!

14:21.391 --> 14:24.554
Dwight, would you take
my grandmother for a walk

14:24.627 --> 14:25.958
while I talk to
the real Helene?

14:26.029 --> 14:27.053
Come on, old lady,
let's go.

14:27.130 --> 14:28.119
What is happening?

14:28.198 --> 14:29.722
 Come on.

14:29.899 --> 14:33.096
Who can tell me
the safest form
of safe sex?

14:33.236 --> 14:34.931
Condoms.
Incorrect.

14:35.105 --> 14:37.198
The only true form
of safe sex...

14:38.241 --> 14:39.936
Okay? Abstinence.

14:40.076 --> 14:42.203
Oh! I didn't
realize we were doing

14:42.512 --> 14:43.877
trick questions.

14:44.080 --> 14:45.877
What's the safest
way to go skiing?

14:46.349 --> 14:47.680
Don't ski.

14:47.751 --> 14:48.945
DARRYL: Huh?

14:49.619 --> 14:50.677
I just thought
I'd bring it up

14:50.754 --> 14:52.722
in case someone here
was practicing abstinence.

14:53.556 --> 14:54.648
That's all. Anybody?

14:54.791 --> 14:56.884
Andy, that's way too
personal of a question.

14:56.960 --> 14:58.689
Well, someone
could answer it
if they wanted to.

15:02.065 --> 15:03.657
Okay, in that case,

15:03.733 --> 15:06.998
I will now show you how
to put this condom on using...

15:09.572 --> 15:11.233
...this pencil.
Oh, God!

15:11.775 --> 15:12.799
What?

15:12.876 --> 15:14.366
Why would you
choose a pencil, Andy?

15:14.677 --> 15:16.201
Well, I'm not gonna
use my penis, Oscar.

15:16.279 --> 15:18.042
It's not exactly
hard right now, anyway.

15:18.114 --> 15:20.241
Come on, give it
a rest, pencil .

15:20.316 --> 15:21.943
I'm doing this
for you, Meredith!

15:22.118 --> 15:23.881
I didn't want it!
Well, didn't you?

15:23.953 --> 15:25.386
Why didn't...

15:25.455 --> 15:28.322
Does no one appreciate
what I'm doing right now?

15:29.359 --> 15:30.621
MEREDITH: Whoa!

15:32.462 --> 15:34.726
It'll go away in time.
Just don't touch it.

15:35.131 --> 15:37.292
Did I make more
of what we had

15:37.367 --> 15:38.459
than was really there?

15:38.802 --> 15:39.894
What did you think we were?

15:40.136 --> 15:43.162
Just a quirky indie movie,

15:43.239 --> 15:44.706
weird sort of thing,

15:45.208 --> 15:48.109
breaking all the rules,
but had to end

15:48.178 --> 15:50.669
because the summer
was over for you.

15:51.314 --> 15:53.578
I think that for you
to have come here

15:53.650 --> 15:55.641
even expecting

15:56.352 --> 15:58.149
that we could have
a conversation like this

15:58.221 --> 16:01.156
shows how
self-deluded you are.

16:01.591 --> 16:05.789
Michael, your memory
has failed you greatly.

16:06.930 --> 16:08.022
Jerk.

16:21.177 --> 16:22.269
Michael.

16:24.280 --> 16:25.975
So, this is a chef's kitchen,

16:26.049 --> 16:28.483
which makes it perfect
for real entertainers.

16:28.785 --> 16:30.810
Real entertainer,
like Billy Joel.

16:31.254 --> 16:33.984
Michael.
Carole. How are you?

16:34.157 --> 16:35.385
I'm great. How are you?

16:35.458 --> 16:38.154
I'm great.
I saw your sign outside,

16:38.294 --> 16:40.023
and I decided
I'm gonna pull in,

16:40.129 --> 16:41.926
and maybe I'm going to
buy a house from her.

16:42.165 --> 16:43.598
You didn't call my office

16:43.666 --> 16:45.497
and ask them
where I was?
No!

16:45.568 --> 16:46.762
That's so...

16:46.936 --> 16:48.904
'Cause the receptionist
told me that a man called,

16:48.972 --> 16:51.133
but he would only say
that he was my ex-Iover.

16:51.207 --> 16:52.265
Weird.
Yeah.

16:52.342 --> 16:53.366
Sounds like a nice guy.

16:54.077 --> 16:57.103
I don't know,
I mean, people were being
really mean to Meredith and...

16:57.480 --> 16:59.345
But this wasn't really
about Meredith, was it?

17:00.383 --> 17:01.407
You and Erin
were broken up.

17:01.584 --> 17:03.745
How is that
relevant to anything?

17:03.820 --> 17:06.550
I asked you
if it was okay
if I asked her out.

17:06.990 --> 17:08.480
You said, and I quote,

17:09.025 --> 17:11.585
"My good sir,
nothing would make me happier

17:11.661 --> 17:14.561
"than to hand you the hand
of the hand once in my hand."

17:14.998 --> 17:17.728
I specifically remembered it
because you said it
in such a weird way.

17:18.233 --> 17:19.258
Well, the only
reason I said that

17:19.335 --> 17:21.200
is 'cause you
asked me so politely,

17:21.337 --> 17:23.635
and it was very
difficult for me
to say no.

17:24.707 --> 17:25.901
I'll let this slide,

17:27.210 --> 17:30.270
but I expect you
to put this whole
Erin thing behind you.

17:30.847 --> 17:32.280
Oh, wow!
Another living room.

17:32.515 --> 17:33.504
It's a family room.

17:33.750 --> 17:36.913
You put the TV there.
You put your family here.

17:37.887 --> 17:39.912
Michael,
why are you here?

17:40.590 --> 17:41.955
Somebody told me

17:42.025 --> 17:44.960
that I romanticize
relationships.

17:45.862 --> 17:47.853
You know,
we all do that.

17:48.531 --> 17:50.021
I have herpes.

17:50.600 --> 17:51.692
What?

17:52.335 --> 17:53.893
Did you have that
while we were together?

17:53.970 --> 17:55.062
I just found out today.

17:55.138 --> 17:57.436
It's right there.

17:57.840 --> 17:59.808
Oh! Oh! What, that's what
you're talking about?

17:59.909 --> 18:01.570
Mmm-hmm. I'm sorry.

18:01.744 --> 18:03.041
Did you have a doctor
check it out?

18:03.112 --> 18:05.012
I'm between specialists
right now.

18:05.949 --> 18:07.974
Yes. Yes, Michael.

18:08.084 --> 18:11.247
Actually, you do make
a bigger deal out of things

18:11.321 --> 18:12.720
than you need to.

18:12.822 --> 18:15.017
You proposed to me
on our fourth date.

18:15.291 --> 18:16.849
Well, I believe in
love at first sight.

18:17.360 --> 18:18.588
Well, so do I,

18:18.661 --> 18:20.856
but we didn't love
each other at first,
either.

18:21.731 --> 18:23.358
I don't know what
you were thinking.

18:24.867 --> 18:26.459
I know what I was
thinking at the time,

18:26.536 --> 18:28.527
but right now,
it just seems ridiculous.

18:28.905 --> 18:30.236
DWIGHT: Excuse me.

18:31.541 --> 18:33.372
Someone died in the upstairs
bathroom, didn't they?

18:33.610 --> 18:34.634
No.

18:37.480 --> 18:39.641
We should
schedule meetings,

18:39.716 --> 18:41.650
'cause the days can
slip away with chitchat.

18:43.252 --> 18:44.480
Are you crying?

18:45.021 --> 18:46.511
No, I'm just sweating.

18:46.589 --> 18:48.318
I don't know
what's got you upset,

18:48.391 --> 18:51.053
but my advice
is stop crying.

18:51.127 --> 18:52.651
I'm not crying.
I'm sweating.

18:52.996 --> 18:54.725
Look, you need
to pick yourself up.

18:55.064 --> 18:56.725
Man up, all right?

18:57.400 --> 18:59.265
Son, you will win this
in the end.

19:00.003 --> 19:01.903
It's all about heart

19:02.505 --> 19:03.995
and character.

19:04.073 --> 19:06.371
Be your best self.

19:07.443 --> 19:08.467
Okay.

19:08.578 --> 19:09.670
Yeah.

19:09.846 --> 19:11.336
I have no idea
what his problem is.

19:11.447 --> 19:13.108
It's just my standard advice.

19:13.182 --> 19:14.410
It's good advice, right?

19:14.851 --> 19:16.079
<i>This is Holly Flax.</i>

19:16.152 --> 19:17.346
I <i>can't come to</i>
<i>the phone right now,</i>

19:17.420 --> 19:18.648
<i>but please leave a message</i>

19:18.721 --> 19:20.712
<i>at the sound of</i>
<i>the tiny truck backing up.</i>

19:22.492 --> 19:24.119
Hi, Holly, it's Michael.

19:25.261 --> 19:26.956
I just wanted to
call and let you know

19:27.030 --> 19:28.793
that I was thinking
about what you said.

19:29.532 --> 19:31.432
It's just, you know,

19:33.336 --> 19:35.270
it's weird. Today, I

19:35.805 --> 19:38.467
ended up seeing a lot of
the women that I used to date,

19:39.475 --> 19:41.705
and in my mind,
they were all great.

19:42.578 --> 19:44.546
And then when I
actually saw them,

19:45.281 --> 19:47.374
it was mostly a freak show.

19:47.650 --> 19:48.708
And you and me,

19:48.785 --> 19:51.253
that must have been
a real train wreck.

19:52.989 --> 19:54.479
You know what?

19:56.025 --> 19:57.788
Holly, you're wrong.

19:59.662 --> 20:00.822
You are wrong.

20:02.031 --> 20:04.261
I remember
every second of us.

20:04.333 --> 20:06.392
And talking to you today,

20:06.469 --> 20:11.065
I don't feel for them
anything like what
I feel for you.

20:11.808 --> 20:13.002
It's...

20:13.810 --> 20:15.573
I didn't joke
with any of them.

20:15.645 --> 20:17.272
I joked with you.

20:18.047 --> 20:19.480
You were the only one

20:19.549 --> 20:22.017
who was actually happy
to hear from me.

20:22.452 --> 20:24.818
And I don't know why
you downgraded what we had,

20:24.887 --> 20:26.980
but I did not make us up.

20:28.624 --> 20:29.716
Okay.

20:30.359 --> 20:32.919
Oh, and you might,
you should talk to a doctor

20:32.995 --> 20:35.088
because you might have herpes.

20:35.231 --> 20:36.220
Bye.

20:42.438 --> 20:44.235
What is this about?
Oscar,

20:44.507 --> 20:46.907
We once sucked face in public

20:47.610 --> 20:49.874
as part of
an office presentation

20:49.946 --> 20:53.404
to destroy the stigma
about gay kissing.

20:53.750 --> 20:55.547
Do you recall?
Yes, and...

20:55.618 --> 20:57.745
You may have given me
a sexually
transmitted disease.

20:58.254 --> 20:59.243
What?

20:59.322 --> 21:00.311
Herpes duplex.

21:00.690 --> 21:03.250
It's probably just
an ingrown mustache hair,
but we have to be exhaustive.

21:03.626 --> 21:06.356
I've already
contacted all of my
ex-Iovers except for you.

21:07.130 --> 21:08.324
We were never lovers.

21:08.397 --> 21:10.695
I'm gonna need
a list of every man
you've ever had sex with.

21:10.933 --> 21:13.493
I'm talking train stations,
men's rooms...

21:13.569 --> 21:16.538
Flower shops,
fireworks celebrations...

21:16.773 --> 21:17.865
Fence with a hole in it.

21:17.940 --> 21:18.964
Moonlit gondola.

21:19.041 --> 21:20.565
Carriage ride
through Central Park.

21:20.643 --> 21:22.133
The woods behind
the liquor store.

21:22.211 --> 21:23.610
The swamp behind
the old folks' home.

21:23.679 --> 21:25.237
MICHAEL:
Electric car dealership.

21:25.314 --> 21:26.804
DWIGHT:
The Democratic Primary.

21:26.883 --> 21:29.010
Oscar, think about... Think.
