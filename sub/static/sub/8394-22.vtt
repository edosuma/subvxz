SUCH A HARD TIME

07:02.870 --> 07:03.484
IN ART CLASS

07:03.590 --> 07:05.649
HE WAS BLOCKED CREATIVELY.

07:05.770 --> 07:07.909
AND HIS ARTIST MOTHER GAVE HIM

07:08.010 --> 07:10.285
A LITTLE INSPIRATIONAL TALK
ABOUT FREEING HIMSELF UP.

07:10.390 --> 07:11.175
- YOUR LEARNING DISABILITY.

07:11.290 --> 07:13.212
THREE DAYS LATER.

- OKAY, COME ON, YOU GUYS.
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

07:33.100 --> 07:35.091
- ONE TEST AFI'ER ANOTHER.

07:35.210 --> 07:36.279
SUCH A WASTE OF MONEY.

07:36.380 --> 07:39.133
HE'S A LITTLE BANGED UP,
BUT HE'S FINE.

07:39.250 --> 07:40.239
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN HIM

07:40.350 --> 07:43.899

MOUNTAIN BIKE WHEN HE WAS 16.

07:44.010 --> 07:48.219

IT'S MORE ABOUT, LIKE,

07:48.320 --> 07:49.833
POSSIBLE INTERNAL BLEEDING,

SO THEY JUST HAVE TO DO
A BUNCH OF TESTS

07:51.670 --> 07:53.638
TO MAKE SURE, YOU KNOW.

07:53.740 --> 07:56.743
- SO HOW LONG DID YOU AND RYAN
DATE FOR?

07:58.440 --> 08:03.332
- UH, FOR A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE
HIS THIRD TOUR IN AFGHANISTAN

08:03.440 --> 08:08.207
AND THEN...
A LITTLE WHILE AFTER.

08:15.390 --> 08:18.109

08:29.990 --> 08:30.911
- COMPLICATED?

08:31.020 --> 08:32.749
EITHER YOU'RE MARRIED TO HIM
OR YOU'RE NOT.

08:32.850 --> 08:33.396
- NO, WE WERE--
WE WERE--

08:33.510 --> 08:35.432
WE WERE ENGAGED.

08:35.540 --> 08:37.235
- WAIT A SECOND.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

08:37.340 --> 08:38.056
YOU SAID YOU WERE HIS WIFE.

08:38.170 --> 08:39.819
YOU'RE LISTED
AS HIS BENEFICIARY.

08:42.450 --> 08:44.793
- HOW'D YOU SWING THAT?

08:47.380 --> 08:49.940
- OH, MY GOD.
- WHAT?

08:50.040 --> 08:52.031
- YOU WERE SUCH
A LITTLE CHUBSTER.

08:52.150 --> 08:54.038
- THAT'S SO RUDE!

08:54.150 --> 08:55.526
I CAN'T BELIEVE MY MOM
TURNED THIS INTO

08:55.630 --> 08:57.518
HER STUPID CAMPAIGN OFFICE.

08:57.640 --> 08:58.709
THIS IS MY ROOM.

08:58.810 --> 09:00.596
- MY MOM WOULD NEVER
GET OFF THE COUCH,

09:00.710 --> 09:01.278
SO SHE HAS THAT
GOING FOR HER.

09:01.400 --> 09:04.813
- YOUR MOM IS SO COOL.

09:04.920 --> 09:06.535
SHE'S AN AMAZING ARTIST.
- MMM...THAT'S UP FOR DEBATE.

09:06.640 --> 09:09.222
- I'M EXCITED FOR YOU
TO MEET EVERYBODY ELSE.

09:09.340 --> 09:11.479
I THINK THEY'RE GONNA LIKE YOU.

09:11.580 --> 09:13.332
- WELL, I AM YOUR
SUPER-AWESOME BEST FRIEND.

09:16.930 --> 09:20.172
- I CAN'T--I'M SOR--
I KNOW.

09:20.280 --> 09:23.693
- YOU KNOW, THEY'RE NOT GONNA
LOVE YOU ANY LESS.

09:23.800 --> 09:26.177
- YEAH, I KNOW.

09:26.280 --> 09:29.147
- SO WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF?

09:31.460 --> 09:33.667
- I DON'T KNOW.

09:37.050 --> 09:38.915
- HEY.

09:41.400 --> 09:45.052
- I KNOW
I'M BEING REALLY STUPID.

09:45.170 --> 09:48.924
- I'M HAPPY TO BE
YOUR SUPER-AWESOME BEST FRIEND.

09:51.030 --> 09:53.089
TELL THEM WHEN YOU'RE READY.
DON'T DO IT FOR ME.

09:53.210 --> 09:54.689
DO IT FOR YOURSELF.

09:58.590 --> 10:01.104
- SEE?

10:01.220 --> 10:03.597
YOU ARE MY SUPER-AWESOME
BEST FRIEND.

10:06.430 --> 10:09.490
- MY HOMEWORK PACKET
IS NOT WHERE IT USUALLY IS.

10:09.600 --> 10:11.227
- MAX, GET OUT!

10:11.330 --> 10:13.059
- AND THE ONLY THING THAT'S
CHANGED IS THAT YOU'RE HOME.

10:13.160 --> 10:13.979
- GET OUT!

10:14.090 --> 10:15.318
- SO THE ONLY THING
I CAN ASSUME

10:15.440 --> 10:17.294
IS THAT YOU OR LAUREN
MOVED IT.

10:18.790 --> 10:19.882
- [laughs]

10:24.140 --> 10:25.892
- I'M WALKING BACKWARDS.
COULD YOU SLOW DOWN?

10:26.000 --> 10:27.035
- ARE YOU GOING HIGH OR LOW?

10:27.140 --> 10:28.721
YOU GONNA GO HIGH?
- THIS ISN'T GONNA WORK.

10:28.830 --> 10:30.411
I'M GOING LOW.
- NO, STAND IT UP.

10:30.520 --> 10:31.828
- CROSBY--
- NOM YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO

10:31.940 --> 10:34.340
STAND IT--
- [groans] UHH...

10:34.460 --> 10:36.416
- YOU'RE LUCKY THAT DIDN'T
TAKE OFF THIS HANDRAIL HERE.

10:36.530 --> 10:38.737
- I WISH HE'D HIRED MOVERS.

10:38.840 --> 10:41.286
- I WISH THIS THING
WOULD HAVE LANDED

10:41.390 --> 10:42.630
ON THAT STUPID BIRDHOUSE

10:42.740 --> 10:45.186
AND GOT RID OF THAT
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

10:45.290 --> 10:46.632
- WHY ARE YOU SO OBSESSED
WITH THAT BIRDHOUSE?

10:46.740 --> 10:47.809
YOU'RE SO WEIRD ABOUT THAT.

10:47.920 --> 10:51.674
- BECAUSE I...
DIDN'T MAKE THAT BIRDHOUSE.

10:51.780 --> 10:52.747
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- I STOLE IT.

10:52.850 --> 10:55.239
MINE BROKE IN THE KILN,
THE ONE I MADE

10:55.340 --> 10:56.546
THAT MOM COACHED ME THROUGH
SHE'S SO PROUD OF.

10:56.650 --> 10:58.823
- RIGHT.
- SO YOU REMEMBER THAT GIRL

10:58.930 --> 11:01.069
CAROL BARKER THAT LIVED,
LIKE, EIGHT DOORS DOWN?

11:01.170 --> 11:02.922
- THAT WAS CAROL BARBER.
- CAROL BARBER.

11:03.040 --> 11:04.416
- THE BIG TEETH? BRAIDS?
- YES, YES.

11:04.520 --> 11:06.340
BUCK-TOOTHED BARBER.
WE HAVE THE SAME INITIALS.

11:06.450 --> 11:07.929
SO I TOOK HERS.

11:08.040 --> 11:09.211
THAT'S HER BIRDHOUSE.
- YEAH, YEAH, SMOOTH.

11:09.320 --> 11:11.379
- AND EVERY TIME I TRIED TO
TELL MOM THE TRUTH,

11:11.490 --> 11:12.866
I COULD SEE HOW EXCITED SHE WAS
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

11:12.980 --> 11:15.596
AND THEN THE THING JUST KIND OF
SPIRALED INTO A LIE.

11:15.700 --> 11:16.837
SO I HID IT IN THE ATTIC.

11:16.950 --> 11:18.019
I DIDN'T THINK
SHE'D EVER FIND IT.

11:18.120 --> 11:19.496
AND NOW IT'S OUT IN THE OPEN.

11:19.600 --> 11:20.806
- AND YOU DON'T WANT MOM
TO FIND OUT

11:20.920 --> 11:21.909
THAT YOUR WHOLE LIFE
IS A LIE.

11:22.020 --> 11:24.432
SO I SHOULDN'T MENTION
THE HOT BIRDHOUSE

11:24.540 --> 11:26.394
THAT YOU STOLE
FROM CAROL BARBER.

11:26.510 --> 11:27.534
[muffled chatter]
- WHAT IS THAT?

11:27.650 --> 11:28.810
[slap]
- OOH!

11:28.920 --> 11:30.683
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS
REMINDS ME OF?

11:30.790 --> 11:31.950
- WHAT?
- THE TIME WE BOBSLEDDED

11:32.070 --> 11:33.264
DOWN HERE.
YOU REMEMBER THAT?

11:33.380 --> 11:34.642
BIG TIME WRESTLING
TURNED INTO BOBSLEDDING.

11:34.760 --> 11:36.068
- I DON'T REMEMBER
THE TIME WE BOBSLEDDED.

11:36.170 --> 11:39.037
- WE BECAME LEGENDS.
- OHH...

11:41.830 --> 11:43.650
- I HATE IT IN HERE
WITHOUT ALL--

11:43.770 --> 11:45.078
ALL THE FURNITURE OUT.

11:45.180 --> 11:46.590
- IT'S A SHOCK, MAN.
- YEAH.

11:46.700 --> 11:49.385
IT LOOKS EMPTY,
AND I DON'T LIKE IT.

11:51.670 --> 11:54.662
- IT PISSES ME OFF THAT
THEY WENT AHEAD AND DID THIS.

11:54.780 --> 11:56.805
- MM-HMM.

11:56.920 --> 11:59.571
- I DIDN'T THINK DAD
WAS GONNA DO IT.

11:59.680 --> 12:03.741
- YEAH.
I HAD THAT PHASE MYSELF.

12:03.860 --> 12:05.236
I'M ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT.

12:05.340 --> 12:06.716
I WENT THROUGH ALL EIGHT.

12:06.820 --> 12:09.960
- I HAD A LOT OF GOOD MEMORIES
IN THIS HOUSE.

12:10.070 --> 12:11.514
I WAS HOPING TO MAKE SOME MORE,

12:11.620 --> 12:13.201
HOPING NORA COULD HAVE
A SLEEPOVER

12:13.310 --> 12:14.516
IN THE GUEST HOUSE.

12:14.630 --> 12:17.383
MAYBE HADDIE'D GET MARRIED HERE.

12:17.490 --> 12:18.934
- SPEAKING OF GOOD MEMORIES,

12:19.040 --> 12:20.974
YOU GOT ONE RUN LEFT IN YOU,
OLD GUY?

12:26.260 --> 12:27.522
- OH, THERE SHE IS.
HEY. HEY.

12:27.640 --> 12:28.914
- HEY,
LET'S NOT GO THIS WAY.

12:29.020 --> 12:30.874
- DO YOU WANT US--
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

12:30.990 --> 12:31.672
IT'S A BAD VIBE IN THERE.
- WHY? IS HE OKAY?

12:31.780 --> 12:34.294
- BECAUSE RYAN'S MOM IS HERE.

12:34.400 --> 12:36.914
SHE DOESN'T EVEN WANT ME
IN THE ROOM WITH THE DOCTOR.

12:37.030 --> 12:39.089
SHE'S HAVING, LIKE,
A POWER TRIP ISSUE WITH ME.

12:39.200 --> 12:40.849
- YOU WANT ME TO TALK TO HER?
- NO, I THINK IT'S BETTER--

12:40.960 --> 12:42.780
- I CAN SAY SOMETHING--
- HANK!

12:42.900 --> 12:44.549
- NO, NO, NOT YOU.
- MAYBE IF A GUY GOES IN--

12:44.660 --> 12:46.548
- WAIT, YOU'RE STILL HERE?
- YEAH.

12:46.660 --> 12:48.412
YEAH, YEAH,
I'M STICKING AROUND.

12:48.520 --> 12:49.794
- HANK'S JUST STICKING AROUND.

12:49.900 --> 12:51.549
- WELL...

12:52.800 --> 12:53.767
- I GOT YOU SOME
VITAMIN WATER, TOO.

12:53.870 --> 12:56.384
YOU'RE PROBABLY DEHYDRATED
OR SOMETHING.

12:56.490 --> 12:57.457
YOU LOST A LOT OF WATER.

12:57.560 --> 12:58.527
- THANK YOU.
- CRYING.

12:58.630 --> 12:59.597
- LISTEN, SERIOUSLY, GUYS.

12:59.700 --> 13:02.214
I THINK IT'S BEST
IF YOU GO HOME.

13:02.330 --> 13:03.319
I'M FINE.

13:03.430 --> 13:05.011
I JUST FEEL LIKE
I NEED TO BE THERE FOR HIM.

13:05.120 --> 13:06.678
- WELL, LET ME GIVE YOU
THE HOTEL KEY.

13:06.780 --> 13:07.917
OKAY?
- OKAY. THAN KS.

13:08.020 --> 13:09.817
- CALL ANY TIME.

13:11.300 --> 13:12.779
- OH.
IT'S GONNA BE FINE.

13:12.890 --> 13:13.743
I TOLD YOU
IT WAS GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

13:13.860 --> 13:16.499
- I COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT
WITHOUT YOU.

13:16.620 --> 13:18.850
YEAH, BUT IT'S, UH...
IT'S ALL WORKING OUT.

13:18.970 --> 13:20.062
- ARE YOU READY?

13:20.170 --> 13:21.444
YOU WANT TO SHOUT?
- I'M READY. YES.

13:21.550 --> 13:22.448
- THREE, TWO, ONE.

13:22.560 --> 13:24.346
_ GO!
[screaming]

13:24.450 --> 13:25.348
OH!

13:25.450 --> 13:26.553
AND HE STICKS THE LANDING!
- NICE!

13:26.660 --> 13:28.696
- OH-HO-HO!

13:28.800 --> 13:31.246
UNBELIEVABLE!
- YOU STUCK THE LANDING.

13:31.360 --> 13:32.759
- AND CROSBY BRAVERMAN...
- ADD A LITTLE BIT OF STYLE

13:32.880 --> 13:35.667
TO THIS NOW.
- THE YOUNGER AND DUMBER

13:35.780 --> 13:37.327
BRAVERMAN, ABOUT TO TAKE
THE STEEP SLOPES.

13:37.430 --> 13:40.740
- PRODIGY! CROSBY BRAVERMAN,
THREE, TWO, ONE.

13:40.850 --> 13:43.193
OH--OH--OH!

13:43.300 --> 13:45.404
- OH, MY GOD,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

13:45.510 --> 13:47.785
- WHAT THE HELL IS ALL
THE RUCKUS OUT HERE?

13:47.890 --> 13:49.619
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- NOTHING!

13:49.720 --> 13:50.789
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

13:50.890 --> 13:52.300
- ARE YOU HURT?
- HE'S ALL RIGHT.

13:52.410 --> 13:53.024
- YEAH, MAYBE A LITTLE BIT.
- LET ME GET SOME ICE.

13:53.140 --> 13:54.471
- IT'S MY SHOULDER, I THINK.

13:54.590 --> 13:55.966
- HEY, CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?
- WHAT?

13:56.070 --> 13:58.061
OW! OW!
- WHAT THE HECK IS WRONG

13:58.180 --> 13:59.966
WITH YOU, FOR PETE'S SAKE?
- IT WAS HIS IDEA.

14:00.080 --> 14:02.071
- [stammers]
TA'I'I'LETALING?

14:02.180 --> 14:03.795
- I WILL TELL HER
ABOUT THE BIRDHOUSE.

14:03.910 --> 14:04.695
- DON'T--
HEY!

14:04.800 --> 14:07.041
[thud]

14:09.600 --> 14:10.942
[door opens]

14:11.050 --> 14:11.732
- HEY.

14:11.850 --> 14:14.227
- HOW'S THE MOVE GOING?

14:14.330 --> 14:15.706
- OH, IT'S GOING.

14:15.820 --> 14:17.082
THERE'S A LOT MORE
IN THAT BIG OLD HOUSE

14:17.200 --> 14:18.644
THAN I THOUGHT THERE WAS.

14:18.750 --> 14:21.366
- MM.

14:21.480 --> 14:22.674
- HOW ARE YOU DOING?

14:22.790 --> 14:23.927
- GOOD.
- YEAH?

14:24.030 --> 14:25.304
I'M JUST EXCITED YOU'RE HOME.

14:25.410 --> 14:28.095
WHEN YOU'RE HERE, EVERYTHING
FEELS LIKE IT'S COMPLETE.

14:28.210 --> 14:29.131
- DAD.

14:29.240 --> 14:30.377
- I'M NOT GONNA
GET ALL SAPPY ON YOU.

14:30.490 --> 14:32.173
- NO, DAD.
- IT MAKES ME FEEL A LOT BETTER,

14:32.280 --> 14:34.032
ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE
MOVING THIS HOUSE, SO...

14:34.140 --> 14:36.005
IT'D BE NICE TO HEAR FROM YOU
A LITTLE MORE OFTEN.

14:36.110 --> 14:37.623
- OH, MY GOD. DON'T.
- I DON'T WANNA BE A NAG--

14:37.730 --> 14:39.049
- I CALL YOU ALL THE TIME.

14:39.150 --> 14:40.833
- HOW'S YOUR FRIEND LAUREN
LIKING THE BAY AREA?

14:40.940 --> 14:42.419
- SHE LOVES IT.
- SHE DOES?

14:42.530 --> 14:43.906
- YEAH.
- YOU BEEN TAKING HER AROUND?

14:44.020 --> 14:44.770
- YEAH, SHE'S OBSESSED.

14:44.880 --> 14:45.778
- WELL, GOOD.
- YEAH.

14:45.880 --> 14:48.940
- WELL, SHE SEEMS VERY COOL.

14:49.060 --> 14:51.528
- YES.
SHE'S--SHE'S REALLY COOL.

14:51.640 --> 14:56.475
I NEVER HAD A RELATIONSHIP
THAT WAS LIKE THIS BEFORE,

14:56.580 --> 14:59.094
LIKE, SHE REALLY...GETS ME

14:59.200 --> 15:01.373
AND INTRODUCES ME TO NEW STUFF

15:01.480 --> 15:03.402
AND, LIKE, PUSHES ME
TO BE BETTER.

15:03.520 --> 15:08.275
AND IT'S BEEN REALLY IMPORTANT
AND GOOD FOR ME.

15:09.770 --> 15:11.078
- GOOD.

15:11.180 --> 15:12.147
LISTEN, THE FRIENDS
YOU MAKE IN COLLEGE

15:12.250 --> 15:14.172
ARE SOMETIMES FRIENDS
FOR A LIFETIME.

15:14.980 --> 15:17.631
THAT'S GREAT.
THAT'S GREAT, HADDIE.

15:17.740 --> 15:19.776
I'M GLAD YOU'VE MADE
SUCH A GOOD FRIEND SO SOON.

15:19.880 --> 15:22.428
THAT'S AWESOME.

15:22.540 --> 15:23.871
- YEAH, ME TOO.

15:23.990 --> 15:25.708
WE'RE GONNA GO UPSTAIRS.
- ALL RIGHT.

15:25.820 --> 15:27.913
- LOVE YOU, DAD.
- ALL RIGHT.

15:28.030 --> 15:29.224
- TALK TO YOU LATER.
- I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

15:29.340 --> 15:30.989
LOVE YOU.
- GOOD LUCK WITH THE MOVE.

15:36.380 --> 15:37.995
- ALL RIGHT. YOU GOT IT?
- YEAH.

15:38.100 --> 15:39.340
- ALL RIGHT.
JUST WATCH THAT DOORWAY.

15:39.450 --> 15:42.169
- WHY IS IT SO HEAW?
- IT'S MADE OUT OF CAST IRON.

15:42.280 --> 15:44.145
- WELL, YOU'VE GOT TO BE CAREFUL
WITH THIS.

15:44.250 --> 15:45.558
IT'S GOT SOME SENTIMENTAL
VALUE.

15:45.660 --> 15:46.627
- WE GOT IT.

15:46.730 --> 15:48.425
- HOW LONG DO YOU NEED ME
TO DO THIS, GRANDPA?

15:48.530 --> 15:50.589
- WELL, UNTIL EVERYTHING'S
PACKED AND LOADED UP

15:50.700 --> 15:53.669
AND THEN UNPACKED AND UNLOADED,
GRANDSON.

15:53.780 --> 15:55.179
CAREFUL!

15:55.290 --> 15:57.872
- THIS SUMMER IS JUST
NOT HAPPENING FOR ME.

15:57.990 --> 16:00.322
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- I GOT TO SET IT DOWN, YEAH.

16:00.440 --> 16:02.192
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
THIS SUMMER'S SO BAD?

16:02.300 --> 16:03.779
WHAT ABOUT YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

16:03.890 --> 16:06.609
- SHE'S IN PORTLAND
THE WHOLE SUMMER.

16:06.720 --> 16:07.197
- WELL, GO SEE HER.

16:07.310 --> 16:09.062
- I CAN'T.
I'M BROKE.

16:09.170 --> 16:11.229
I DOUBT SHE EVEN
WANTS TO SEE ME.

16:11.340 --> 16:14.992
SHE TOLD ME THAT SHE LOVED ME,
AND I JUST STARED AT HER.

16:15.110 --> 16:16.623
IT'S SO STUPID.

16:16.730 --> 16:19.790
AND NOW I'M STAYING ON
MY MOM'S COUCH THE WHOLE SUMMER.

16:19.900 --> 16:22.619
IT'S FINE.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

16:22.740 --> 16:24.071
- HEY, WELL--WELL, NO...

16:24.190 --> 16:26.078
YOU KNOW, DREW,
THERE'S GONNA BE A REWARD

16:26.190 --> 16:26.690
FOR THE BEST MOVER,
YOU KNOW.

16:26.810 --> 16:28.903
- OH.
REWARD.

16:29.020 --> 16:32.740
- THAT'S PROBABLY LIKE
YOUR LUCKY FIRST DOLLAR.

16:32.850 --> 16:34.818
- [laughs]

16:34.920 --> 16:35.773
- WHAT'D YOU SAY?

16:35.890 --> 16:37.983
- NOTHING.

16:43.960 --> 16:46.758
- OH, WELL,
IF IT ISN'T MRS. YORK.

16:46.860 --> 16:51.069
HAVE A SEAT.

16:51.180 --> 16:53.387
- YOU KNOW, UM...

16:53.490 --> 16:54.764
WHEN I SHOWED UP
AT THE HOSPITAL,

16:54.870 --> 16:59.045
THEY WOULDN'T LET ME SEE HIM
UNLESS I WAS FAMILY.

16:59.150 --> 17:02.039
SO IT'S THE ONLY REASON
I SAID THAT.

17:02.150 --> 17:03.970
THAT'S WHY I SAID
I WAS HIS WIFE.

17:04.090 --> 17:05.739
JUST WANTED TO CLEAR THAT UP
WITH YOU.

17:05.850 --> 17:07.329
- OKAY.
OKAY.

17:07.440 --> 17:09.158
THANK YOU.

17:09.260 --> 17:10.431
- CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING?

17:10.540 --> 17:12.098
- YEAH, CAN I JUST HAVE
COFFEE TO GO, PLEASE?

17:12.200 --> 17:13.952
- I WOULD LOVE ANOTHER ONE,
PLEASE, THANK YOU.

17:14.060 --> 17:15.994
- I'M GOING TO NEED TO ASK YOU
TO PUT THAT OUT.

17:16.100 --> 17:17.920
WE DON'T ALLOW SMOKING.

17:18.030 --> 17:19.338
- CALIFORNIA.

17:22.900 --> 17:24.379
WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE?

17:24.490 --> 17:26.481
JUST HANGING AROUND THE HOTEL?

17:26.590 --> 17:27.409
- UH...NO.

17:27.520 --> 17:29.863
I'M HERE WHILE RYAN'S
IN THE HOSPITAL.

17:29.970 --> 17:31.073
I'M GONNA STICK IT OUT.

17:34.770 --> 17:37.182
- YOU KNOW I'M SIGNING HIM OUT
ON FRIDAY, RIGHT?

17:37.290 --> 17:38.803
I'M TAKING HIM HOME TO WYOMING.

17:41.230 --> 17:45.746
- OKAY, WELL, I...
I JUST WANT TO TALK TO HIM,

17:45.850 --> 17:47.056
YOU KNOW, MAKE SURE
THAT'S WHAT HE WANTS.

17:47.160 --> 17:50.687
- WHY DOES EVERYBODY
WANT TO TALK TO YOU?

17:50.790 --> 17:53.827
ALL THESE DOCTORS AND NURSES,
THEY WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

17:53.930 --> 17:55.158
I'M HIS MOTHER, OKAY?

17:55.280 --> 17:56.929
YOU'RE NOT EVEN HIS GIRLFRIEND.

17:57.040 --> 17:59.793
SO WHY DON'T YOU LET ME TAKE
CARE OF HIS AFFAIRS FROM NOW ON?

18:01.940 --> 18:03.100
- OKAY. YEAH.

18:03.220 --> 18:05.359
I JUST...JUST REALLY
WANT TO MAKE SURE

18:05.460 --> 18:08.691
THAT HIS OPINION DOESN'T
GET LOST IN ALL THIS, TOO.

18:08.810 --> 18:09.799
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

18:09.910 --> 18:13.084
- WELL, HE DOESN'T HAVE
A LOT OF OPTIONS, DOES HE?

18:13.190 --> 18:15.112
HE'S BEEN DISCHARGED
FROM THE ARMY.

18:18.230 --> 18:21.119
- I'M SORRY. WHAT?
- YOU DIDN'T KNOW?

18:21.230 --> 18:24.233
HE DOESN'T HAVE
A POT TO PISS IN, HONEY.

18:27.450 --> 18:29.099
- HMM.
THAT'S CUTE.

18:29.210 --> 18:32.589
YOU WANT TO TRY
THE BLUE ONE INSTEAD?

18:32.690 --> 18:33.827
- NO, I WANT THIS ONE.
- OKAY, THAT'S FINE.

18:33.940 --> 18:37.034
- THIS IS THE ONE I WANT.
EXCUSE ME, TAILOR PERSON.

18:37.150 --> 18:40.142
- MAX,
THAT'S KIND OF RUDE.

18:40.250 --> 18:41.933
- IT'S NOT.
HE IS A TAILOR AND A PERSON.

18:42.050 --> 18:44.006
- OKAY,
WE'LL GET THE BROWN.

18:44.120 --> 18:45.519
- IF TWO GIRLS ARE KISSING,

18:45.640 --> 18:48.916
DOES THAT MEAN
THAT THEY'RE LESBIANS?

18:49.020 --> 18:50.908
DON'T PRICK ME.
- HONEY, UM...

18:51.020 --> 18:53.329
WHAT?
WHY WOULD YOU ASK ME--

18:53.440 --> 18:55.715
- HADDIE AND LAUREN
WERE KISSING.

18:59.240 --> 19:01.299
- THEY--HADDIE AND LAUREN--
- YES.

19:01.410 --> 19:03.685
- WERE KISSING LIKE IN THE--
- DON'T PRICK ME.

19:03.790 --> 19:05.849
- SOMETIMES WHEN GIRLS KISS
THEY'RE FRIENDS,

19:05.970 --> 19:07.653
AND SO THEY'RE FRIENDLY,
LIKE--

19:07.760 --> 19:08.829
- I WANT A MAROON TIE.

19:08.940 --> 19:10.009
- THERE'S A FRIENDSHIP.
- I'LL GET THE MAROON TIE.

19:10.110 --> 19:11.862
- MAX, CAN YOU EXPLAIN--
- THIS ONE WORKS.

19:11.970 --> 19:15.861
- UM...ME?

19:15.980 --> 19:16.969
BUDDY.

19:17.080 --> 19:19.116
HONEY,
HOW WERE THEY KISSING?

19:19.220 --> 19:20.596
BUD?

19:20.710 --> 19:22.530
- MY GRANDMA THOUGHT
HE HAD LOST IT.

19:22.640 --> 19:23.800
[laughter]

19:23.920 --> 19:26.673
ONE DAY, I GOT IN TROUBLE
FOR FIGHTING WITH MY SISTER,

19:26.780 --> 19:28.327
BECAUSE SHE'S A FREAK.

19:28.440 --> 19:29.771
AND AS A PUNISHMENT,

19:29.890 --> 19:32.290
MY MOM MADE ME HELP MY GRANDPA
AT FIXING UP THE PONTIAC.

19:32.410 --> 19:33.809
BUT IT TURNED OUT
TO NOT BE A PUNISHMENT.

19:33.930 --> 19:35.989
IT TURNED OUT TO BE JUST
ABOUT THE BEST THING

19:36.100 --> 19:38.375
THAT'S EVER HAPPENED TO ME.

19:38.480 --> 19:39.720
I LEARNED ALL ABOUT CARS

19:39.830 --> 19:41.889
WHEN CARS WERE STILL CARS,
AS MY GRANDPA WOULD SAY.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.173
I GOT TO HEAR SO MANY STORIES
FROM MY GRANDPA

19:44.280 --> 19:46.271
ABOUT VIETNAM
AND HOW THE OAKLAND A'S

19:46.390 --> 19:48.381
SCREWED UP THEIR CHANCES
TO BECOME

19:48.490 --> 19:49.764
THE BEST TEAM IN HISTORY.
[laughter]

19:49.870 --> 19:50.837
AND HE ALSO TAUGHT ME
THE FIVE STRATEGIES

19:50.940 --> 19:53.636
GUARANTEED TO GET A GIRL
TO SAY YES TO A DATE.

19:53.740 --> 19:56.868
[laughter]

19:56.980 --> 19:58.083
WE'RE ALMOST FINISHED
WITH THE PONTIAC NOW.

19:58.190 --> 20:00.818
IT LOOKS BEAUTIFUL,

20:00.920 --> 20:03.127
LIKE THE PRETTIEST GIRL AT
THE PROM, MY GRANDPA WOULD SAY.

20:03.230 --> 20:04.049
I KNOW IT SHOULD
REALLY MAKE ME HAPPY

20:04.160 --> 20:06.788
AND PROUD OF
WHAT WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED,

20:06.890 --> 20:09.688
BUT THE TRUTH IS,
IT MAKES ME KIND OF SAD

20:09.790 --> 20:13.203
BECAUSE THAT CAR HAS TAKEN
A REALLY HARD YEAR FOR ME

20:13.310 --> 20:15.858
AND MADE IT PRETTY DECENT.

20:15.970 --> 20:17.369
I GUESS THE GOOD NEWS IS,

20:17.490 --> 20:19.344
GRANDPA'S GOT HIS EYE
ON A '68 MUSTANG

20:19.450 --> 20:20.007
THAT HE GUARANTEES
WILL DO NOTHING LESS

20:20.110 --> 20:22.078
THAN ROCK MY WORLD,

20:22.180 --> 20:24.933
AND I CAN'T WAIT.

20:25.050 --> 20:27.939
[applause]

20:40.890 --> 20:42.539
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
TODAY, NEW RULE.

20:42.650 --> 20:43.992
I WANT YOU TO FIND
THE BIGGEST CUP

20:44.100 --> 20:45.681
YOU CAN GET, OKAY?

20:45.790 --> 20:47.929
AND STUFF IT WITH TOPPINGS,
ALL THE WAY.

20:48.030 --> 20:48.997
EVERY TOPPING YOU WANT.

20:49.100 --> 20:51.307
IF YOU GUYS AREN'T IN
A SUGAR COMA IN 20 MINUTES,

20:51.420 --> 20:53.172
YOU HAVE FAILED.
ARE WE CLEAR?

20:53.280 --> 20:54.076
- GOT IT.
- GO!

20:54.180 --> 20:57.900
- AH.

20:58.010 --> 20:59.898
- OH, YEAH.
HERE IT COMES!

21:00.010 --> 21:00.317
- [laughs]

21:00.430 --> 21:02.318
WHAT A DAY.

21:02.430 --> 21:03.909
- RIGHT?
- I MEAN...

21:04.020 --> 21:04.941
- IT WAS LIKE A DREAM.

21:05.050 --> 21:06.733
- YEAH,
WHAT AN EXPERIENCE.

21:06.850 --> 21:08.909
THAT WAS AMAZING.

21:09.020 --> 21:10.328
HE'S AMAZING.

21:10.440 --> 21:11.987
- JUST SO MATURE.

21:12.090 --> 21:13.603
- SO POISED UP THERE,
YEAH.

21:13.720 --> 21:15.290
- IT WAS LIKE,
THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE SPEECH,

21:15.410 --> 21:16.160
YOU COULD JUST SEE
HIS CONFIDENCE GROWING.

21:16.270 --> 21:19.478
- YEAH!
HE JUST BECAME AN ADULT

21:19.580 --> 21:21.309
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SPEECH.
- YEAH. [laughs]

21:23.900 --> 21:25.686
- IT WAS NICE.

21:29.180 --> 21:31.000
- YEAH.
[kids whooping]

21:31.110 --> 21:32.998
- OH.
- YEAH.

21:33.110 --> 21:34.498
OKAY, THAT'S A STOMACHACHE.

21:34.600 --> 21:35.931
- MM-HM.

21:36.460 --> 21:39.213
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND TRAFFIC,
YOU KNOW?

21:39.330 --> 21:40.877
- NO?
- IF EVERYBODY JUST

21:40.980 --> 21:43.983
PUT THEIR FOOT ON THE GAS MORE,
WE'D ALL GO.

21:44.090 --> 21:44.499
- [chuckles]
I KNOW.

21:44.610 --> 21:47.602
IT'S A LOT OF TRAFFIC.

21:47.720 --> 21:50.439
- I THINK WE SHOULD
TALK ABOUT...

21:50.550 --> 21:52.541
THE BIG TOMATO
THAT'S IN THE ROOM

21:52.650 --> 21:54.686
WHENEVER WE'RE TOGETHER NOW
FOR THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS.

21:54.790 --> 21:56.929
- THE TOMATO?
- YEAH, YOU KNOW.

21:57.030 --> 21:59.203
THAT'S THE EXPRESSION.
THE BIG TOMATO IN THE ROOM?

21:59.310 --> 22:01.483
- DO YOU MEAN THE ELEPHANT
IN THE ROOM?

22:01.590 --> 22:03.205
- I DON'T, BUT IS THAT
WHAT IT SHOULD BE?

22:03.320 --> 22:05.459
- THAT'S THE EXPRESSION, THOUGH.
- IS THAT WHAT IT SHOULD BE?

22:05.560 --> 22:06.834
- YES, I'M SORRY.

22:06.940 --> 22:08.214
THE TOMATO IN THE ROOM.
- YEAH.

22:08.320 --> 22:09.833
I JUST GOT TO KNOW
WHERE YOU'RE AT.

22:09.940 --> 22:11.669
THAT'S ALL.
YOU KNOW, I KIND OF OPENED UP.

22:11.770 --> 22:13.146
- MM-HMM.
- AND THAT WASN'T EASY.

22:13.260 --> 22:14.739
- I KNOW.
- IT'S HARD FOR ME.

22:14.850 --> 22:16.044
- I KNOW.
- THAT'S ABOUT AS HARD

22:16.160 --> 22:18.048
AS IT GETS FOR ME.

22:18.160 --> 22:21.288
I MEAN, I JUST THOUGHT IF YOU
WANTED TO GIVE IT ANOTHER SHOT,

22:21.400 --> 22:22.810
'CAUSE, UM...
I'M PREPARED FOR ANYTHING.

22:22.920 --> 22:24.228
I JUST--
I JUST KIND OF NEED TO KNOW.

22:24.340 --> 22:26.615
- [exhales]

22:26.720 --> 22:28.472
I REALLY HAVE BEEN
THINKING ABOUT IT,

22:28.580 --> 22:32.232
AND IT JUST SEEMS COMPLICATED,
YOU KNOW,

22:32.350 --> 22:35.376
BECAUSE...WE'VE BEEN DOING
REALLY WELL

22:35.490 --> 22:36.343
JUST WORKING TOGETHER.

22:36.450 --> 22:39.522
AND I KNOW
IT'S NOT RIGHT TO SAY,

22:39.630 --> 22:42.975
BUT THE ASPERGER'S THING,
IT WORRIES ME.

22:43.080 --> 22:46.425
SOMETIMES YOU DON'T--
YOU CAN'T LOOK AT ME.

22:46.530 --> 22:48.464
- I LOOK AT YOU.

22:48.570 --> 22:50.253
- BUT IT'S HARD FOR YOU,

22:50.360 --> 22:53.295
AND I'M A COMMUNICATOR,
AND I NEED THAT.

22:53.400 --> 22:56.642
AND I KNOW YOU'RE WORKING ON IT,
AND I APPRECIATE THAT SO MUCH.

22:58.790 --> 23:01.611
BECAUSE IT WOULDN'T BE...

23:01.720 --> 23:04.371
A SMALL THING, YOU KNOW,
TO TRY AGAIN.

23:04.480 --> 23:05.924
IT WOULD BE A...

23:06.030 --> 23:08.169
- YEAH.
- BIG THING.

23:08.280 --> 23:09.417
- YEAH, I GET IT.

23:09.520 --> 23:10.794
- YEAH, BUT I DON'T KNOW--

23:10.900 --> 23:13.414
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW,
YOU KNOW, UNLESS WE WOULD TRY,

23:13.530 --> 23:18.354
AND THEN WE RISK
ALL THAT.

23:18.460 --> 23:20.212
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

23:20.320 --> 23:22.777
- [softly]
THINK SO.

23:25.710 --> 23:26.392
YOU'RE GOING UNDER
THE SPEED LIMIT.

23:26.500 --> 23:28.058
- OH!
- YOU CAN GET A TICKET

23:28.160 --> 23:29.195
FOR THAT, TOO.

23:29.300 --> 23:30.016
- I WAS NOT EVEN
PAYING ATTENTION.

23:32.130 --> 23:33.950
- HI.

23:37.410 --> 23:39.617
- HOW YOU FEELING?

23:39.720 --> 23:41.756
- PERFECT.
- YOU LOOK INCREDIBLE.

23:41.860 --> 23:42.849
- THANKS.

23:45.380 --> 23:51.421
- SO YOUR MOM TOLD ME THAT YOU
GOT DISCHARGED FROM THE SERVICE.

23:51.530 --> 23:52.804
- YEAH.

23:52.910 --> 23:56.869
- WHAT HAPPENED?

23:56.980 --> 23:59.392
- I WAS STUPID.

23:59.500 --> 24:01.229
I WAS OUT ALL NIGHT PARTYING.

24:01.330 --> 24:02.979
AND THE SUN CAME UP,

24:03.090 --> 24:06.571
AND I HAD TO REPORT BACK
FOR MANEUVERS.

24:09.510 --> 24:13.617
I DROVE IN STILL WASTED,
AND I JUST--

24:13.720 --> 24:14.994
I LOOKED DOWN
AT MY PHONE FOR A SECOND.

24:15.100 --> 24:17.443
I LOOKED UP, AND I WAS
BLOWING THROUGH A RED LIGHT,

24:17.550 --> 24:18.130
AND I HAD TO SWERVE
TO MISS AN S.U.V.

24:18.240 --> 24:22.199
I JUST ROLLED MY TRUCK.

24:22.320 --> 24:24.072
SO HERE I AM, THE...

24:24.180 --> 24:28.116
THE WAR HERO YOU WERE EXPECTING
TO COME RESCUE.

24:30.050 --> 24:30.948
- SORRY.

24:31.050 --> 24:32.802
- YEAH,
THEY WERE COOL ABOUT IT.

24:32.910 --> 24:34.468
THEY, UM...

24:36.060 --> 24:38.460
IT'S NOT LIKE
DISHONORABLE, SO...

24:40.850 --> 24:44.570
- SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO NOW?

24:44.690 --> 24:47.443
- I'LL FIGURE SOMETHING OUT.

24:47.550 --> 24:49.438
- RYAN.
- HMM?

24:49.550 --> 24:50.653
- YOUR MOM TOLD ME THAT

24:50.760 --> 24:54.821
YOU'RE GONNA GO BACK
TO WYOMING WITH HER.

24:54.940 --> 24:55.793
IS THAT TRUE?

24:55.900 --> 24:59.973
- ALL THAT FIGHTING,
ALL THAT SNOW

25:00.080 --> 25:01.900
- YEAH.

25:03.260 --> 25:05.421
- HELP ME UNDERSTAND,

25:05.530 --> 25:09.250
BECAUSE EVERYTHING THAT YOU'VE
EVER TOLD ME ABOUT THAT PLACE

25:09.360 --> 25:11.464
IS THAT YOU HATE IT,
AND YOU NEVER WANT TO GO BACK.

25:11.570 --> 25:14.050
AND IS THAT
REALLY WHAT YOU WANT?

25:14.160 --> 25:17.789
- IT'S, UH...
I DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER OPTIONS.

25:20.030 --> 25:23.409
- TELL ME I'M NOT
GOING HOME

25:23.520 --> 25:26.068
- BUT--
- NO, NO, NO, NO.

25:26.170 --> 25:29.105
NO, NO.
COME HERE.

25:29.210 --> 25:30.620
COME HERE.

25:30.730 --> 25:33.005
- AND I'LL STOP WAITING
BY THE PHONE

25:33.110 --> 25:34.793
- HEY.
- [crYIng]

25:37.600 --> 25:40.524
THIS ISN'T FOR YOU TO FIX,
OKAY?

25:40.640 --> 25:44.224
ALL RIGHT?
I GOTTA DO THIS, OKAY?

25:44.330 --> 25:47.504
IT'S NOT FOR YOU.

25:47.610 --> 25:50.124
_ OKAY?
[sobbing]

25:55.070 --> 25:57.925
- OOH OOH OOH OOH OOH
OOH OOH

25:58.030 --> 26:00.965
- I STILL MISS YOU SO MUCH.

26:01.070 --> 26:03.038
- I THINK ABOUT YOU
EVERY DAY.

26:05.560 --> 26:09.906
- OOH OOH OOH OOH OOH
OOH OOH OOH OOH

26:15.330 --> 26:21.769
BEDROOM FLOOR

26:21.890 --> 26:26.224
AND SILENCE IN MY BLOOD

26:30.890 --> 26:32.096
SORRY, LOVE
- IT'S OKAY.

26:32.210 --> 26:35.065
- I'M RUNNING HOME
- IT'S OKAY.

26:39.140 --> 26:46.319
I'M A CHILD OF SUN
AND THE STARS I LOVE

26:46.430 --> 26:50.184
- [whispers] THAT OKAY?
- YEAH.

26:54.920 --> 26:57.059
Joel: OH, VICTORY
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA HANG IT.

26:57.160 --> 26:58.297
- YES, YOU ARE.
I'M GOING TO HANG IT.

26:58.400 --> 27:00.607
I'M MAKING COLOR COPIES

27:00.720 --> 27:01.266
SO WE CAN POST IT
ALL OVER THE HOUSE.

27:01.370 --> 27:02.120
- ALL OVER THE HOUSE?

27:02.240 --> 27:04.822
- I'LL PUT A BILLBOARD
OUT FRONT.

27:04.930 --> 27:06.966
I LOVE YOU.
I AM SO PROUD OF YOU.

27:07.070 --> 27:08.094
- IT IS WAY PAST YOUR BEDTIME.

27:08.210 --> 27:11.589
- GOOD NIGHT.
- GOOD WORK, BUDDY.

27:11.690 --> 27:12.202
- I'LL TAKE THIS ONE.
- OH, OKAY.

27:12.320 --> 27:15.278
- YEAH, OKAY!

27:15.390 --> 27:16.277
- ALL RIGHTY.

27:16.390 --> 27:19.143
- DON'T GO.

27:19.250 --> 27:21.639
- SWEETIE, IT'S REALLY LATE.
- YEAH.

27:21.740 --> 27:22.183
OKAY.
- WHY DO YOU HAVE TO GO?

27:22.290 --> 27:24.804
- I KNOW.

27:24.910 --> 27:27.879
IT'S JUST--
IT'S THAT TIME OF NIGHT, OKAY?

27:27.990 --> 27:29.708
- I KNOW IT'S BEEN
A REALLY SPECIAL DAY,

27:29.820 --> 27:31.390
AND I DON'T WANT IT
TO END EITHER.

27:31.510 --> 27:33.501
- IT ISN'T SPECIAL.
IT'S HOW IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE.

27:33.610 --> 27:36.295
STAY HERE.
PLEASE, DADDY, STAY.

27:36.410 --> 27:38.059
- HONEY, COME ON, I GOTTA GO.
- YOU LIVE HERE!

27:38.170 --> 27:39.990
YOU SHOULDN'T GO BACK THERE.
- I'VE GOT TO GO.

27:40.100 --> 27:42.728
- NO, DADDY, PLEASE DON'T GO.

27:42.830 --> 27:45.583
PLEASE DON'T GO, DAD.
I WANT YOU TO STAY HERE.

27:45.690 --> 27:48.625
[crying] PLEASE DON'T LEAVE!
- OKAY. OKAY.

27:48.730 --> 27:50.618
- JUST STAY, PLEASE!
- OKAY, BUD.

27:50.730 --> 27:52.698
- WILL YOU STAY, PLEASE?
- ALL RIGHT.

27:52.800 --> 27:54.665
LET'S GET YOU TO BED, OKAY?
- FOREVER, PLEASE.

27:54.770 --> 27:55.247
- HEY, WE'RE GONNA
GET YOU TO BED.

27:55.360 --> 27:57.180
OKAY?
- OKAY.

27:57.290 --> 28:00.009
OKAY.
COME ON.

28:04.470 --> 28:07.155
- I'M REALLY OKAY.

28:07.270 --> 28:08.714
I PROMISE.

28:15.410 --> 28:16.479
- I'LL SEE YOU SOON.

28:16.590 --> 28:18.478
- BYE, BUDDY.

28:18.590 --> 28:20.137
- BYE, BUDDY.

28:34.540 --> 28:36.349
- WELL,
YOU PUT YOUR MOM THROUGH

28:36.470 --> 28:40.019
A VERY, VERY LONG
AND VERY INTENSE LABOR.

28:40.130 --> 28:41.336
I MEAN, SOME SAY EPIC.
[Julia giggles]

28:41.440 --> 28:43.192
AND THE LONGER IT WENT ON,

28:43.300 --> 28:45.120
THE MORE BRAVERMANS
WERE INSISTING

28:45.240 --> 28:48.789
ON COMING INTO
THE DELIVERY ROOM.

28:48.890 --> 28:52.997
AND FINALLY YOUR DAD YELLED
AT THE TOP OF HIS LUNGS,

28:53.110 --> 28:56.557
"NO BRAVERMANS
IN THE BIRTHING ROOM!"

28:56.660 --> 28:59.242
AND EVERYONE WAS SO SHOCKED

28:59.350 --> 29:02.729
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK I'D
RAISED MY VOICE ABOVE A WHISPER

29:02.840 --> 29:04.148
WITH ANY OF THEM.

29:04.250 --> 29:06.184
AND I THOUGHT,
"MAN, DID I GO TOO FAR?"

29:06.290 --> 29:08.281
AND THAT'S WHEN YOUR GRANDPA
PULLED ME ASIDE.

29:08.400 --> 29:11.528
AND HE SAID,
"SONNY...

29:11.640 --> 29:13.153
YOUR FLY'S OPEN."

29:13.260 --> 29:15.535
AND SURE ENOUGH,
I LOOKED DOWN,

29:15.650 --> 29:17.151
AND THERE I WAS,

29:17.270 --> 29:18.601
STANDING IN FRONT OF
A ROOM FULL OF BRAVERMANS

29:18.720 --> 29:21.883
WITH MY FLY OPEN.

29:22.000 --> 29:26.403
AND THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME
HE EVER CALLED ME SONNY,

29:26.520 --> 29:29.580
JUST LIKE HE DOES WITH HIS SONS.

29:29.690 --> 29:32.033
- AND WHAT ABOUT THE GUY
WITH THE NEEDLE?

29:32.140 --> 29:33.380
- OKAY.

29:33.490 --> 29:35.458
WE'VE GOT TO CUT YOU OFF
AT SOME POINT HERE, SWEETIE.

29:35.560 --> 29:38.449
- IT'S OKAY.
OKAY, UM...

29:38.560 --> 29:40.835
WELL, YOUR MOM AND I HAD--

29:40.950 --> 29:44.113
WERE DOING THIS NATURAL
CHILDBIRTH TRAINING COURSE,

29:44.230 --> 29:48.155
WHICH IS LIKE YOU HAVE THE CHILD
WITHOUT ANY PAINKILLERS.

29:48.260 --> 29:51.673
SO WE DID, LIKE,
SIX MONTHS OF THESE CLASSES,

29:51.790 --> 29:54.884
AND THE FIRST TIME
YOUR MOM FELT

29:55.000 --> 29:58.265
LIKE A SERIOUS CONTRACT ION,
SHE SAID,

29:58.380 --> 30:00.348
"GIVE ME THE DRUGS.

30:00.450 --> 30:02.896
NOW."
[Julia laughs]

30:03.000 --> 30:04.752
AND SO THERE'S--
[laughs]

30:04.870 --> 30:06.383
THERE'S THIS DOCTOR
THAT COMES IN

30:06.490 --> 30:09.414
AND GIVES THE PAINKILLERS.
THAT'S HIS ONE JOB.

30:09.530 --> 30:12.215
AND HE WOULD COME IN
AND GAVE HER THE PAINKILLERS,

30:12.320 --> 30:13.730
AND HE'D COME BACK IN
AND CHECK ON HER.

30:13.840 --> 30:15.284
AND EVERY TIME HE DID,

30:15.390 --> 30:19.463
SHE WOULD TURN TO HIM
WITH HER WIDE EYES AND SAY,

30:19.570 --> 30:23.438
"I LOVE YOU.

30:23.540 --> 30:25.189
"I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

30:25.300 --> 30:29.361
YOU'RE SUCH A WONDERFUL MAN."

30:29.480 --> 30:32.574
HERE I WAS GOING THROUGH
40 HOURS OF INTENSE LABOR

30:32.690 --> 30:34.339
NEXT TO THIS WOMAN.

30:34.450 --> 30:38.272
THIS GUY COMES IN
AND GIVES HER ONE SHOT,

30:38.380 --> 30:40.860
AND SHE LOVES HIM.

31:11.660 --> 31:14.037
- G-GRANDSON, YOU GOT TO BE
CAREFUL WITH THAT.

31:14.140 --> 31:15.823
IT'S GOT KNICK-KNACKS IN IT.
- I GOT IT.

31:15.940 --> 31:17.009
IT'S FINE.
- ZEEK.

31:17.110 --> 31:19.146
- HUH?
- WHY DON'T YOU LET DREW GO?

31:19.250 --> 31:21.457
HE'S DONE ENOUGH.
- NO, HE'S LOVING THIS.

31:21.560 --> 31:22.834
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

31:22.950 --> 31:24.178
YOU'RE LOVING THIS,
AREN'T YOU, GRANDSON?

31:24.290 --> 31:26.281
- I'M ABSOLUTELY LOVING IT.
- SEE?

31:26.400 --> 31:28.607
- YEAH, HE LOOKS LIKE
HE'S LOVING IT.

31:28.710 --> 31:29.984
- OKAY.
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

31:30.090 --> 31:31.159
TAKE A BREAK.
TAKE A BREAK.

31:31.260 --> 31:32.602
SET IT DOWN.
SET IT DOWN.

31:32.710 --> 31:34.439
TAKE A BREAK.
YOU DESERVE IT.

31:34.540 --> 31:36.815
I MEAN, ADAM DIDN'T PULL HIS
WEIGHT AS A MOVER.

31:36.920 --> 31:38.399
AND, MY GOSH, CROSBY?

31:38.510 --> 31:40.193
HE INJURED HIMSELF
BEING A SHMUCK.

31:40.310 --> 31:44.371
SO I GUESS BY DEFAULT,
YOU WIN THE BEST MOVER PRIZE.

31:44.480 --> 31:46.175
- THANK YOU.

31:46.280 --> 31:47.679
I WON WHAT,
THE LUCKY DOLLAR?

31:47.800 --> 31:49.381
WHAT IS IT?

31:49.490 --> 31:50.457
- THE LUCKY DOLLAR?

31:50.560 --> 31:51.527
UH-HUH.

31:51.630 --> 31:54.929
WELL, YOU'RE NOT EVEN CLOSE.

32:00.260 --> 32:01.773
- WHAT?

32:01.880 --> 32:03.734
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

32:03.850 --> 32:07.126
- COME ON.
- WHAT?

32:07.230 --> 32:09.118
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

32:09.230 --> 32:12.609
- WELL, YOU CAN GO SEE THAT GIRL
IN PORTLAND NOW.

32:12.720 --> 32:14.574
- OH, GOSH.
- THERE YOU GO.

32:14.690 --> 32:15.679
- NO, I'M NOT--

32:15.790 --> 32:18.304
- AW, COME ON.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

32:18.410 --> 32:21.686
- YEAH.
YEAH, TAKE IT FOR A SPIN.

32:21.800 --> 32:25.270
- I CAN'T...TAKE THE CAR.

32:25.390 --> 32:28.029
- HEY, YOU KNOW SOMETHING,
GRANDSON?

32:28.150 --> 32:31.210
LET ME TELL YOU A SECRET HERE.

32:31.320 --> 32:34.665
YOU'RE NOT
A VERY GOOD MOVER, REALLY.

32:34.780 --> 32:38.910
BUT FROM THE VERY BEGINNING,

32:39.020 --> 32:41.602
I WAS DOING THIS FOR YOU.

32:41.710 --> 32:43.462
IT'S YOURS.

32:47.240 --> 32:49.265
HAVE FUN.
- WOW.

32:53.970 --> 32:54.925
THANK YOU.

32:55.040 --> 32:57.417
- START HER UP.
COME ON.

32:58.560 --> 33:01.176
- OH, MAN.

33:01.280 --> 33:04.352
[engine turns over]

33:08.190 --> 33:09.521
WOW.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

33:09.640 --> 33:13.633
- DON'T GET IN ANY ACCIDENTS.
NO SPEEDING TICKETS.

33:13.750 --> 33:16.913
[Camille laughs]

33:17.020 --> 33:17.987
- BYE, YOU GUYS.

33:18.090 --> 33:19.330
- BYE.

33:27.590 --> 33:29.308

33:29.420 --> 33:31.274

SUCH A PAIN IN THE ASS,

33:31.380 --> 33:33.519
YOU'RE A PRETTY SWEET GUY.

33:33.630 --> 33:35.245
- YOU THINK?

33:35.350 --> 33:38.524
- SO, ARE YOU READY FOR THIS?

33:39.560 --> 33:43.803
- OH, GOD,
I DON'T KNOW, CAMILLE.

33:43.910 --> 33:46.492

33:54.860 --> 33:55.884
- HEY, PEANUT.

33:55.990 --> 33:57.378

34:09.770 --> 34:11.909
- STARING AT ME.

34:12.010 --> 34:13.932

34:14.050 --> 34:15.972

AND I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO
SCARE YOU

35:41.620 --> 35:43.064
OR FREAK YOU OUT,

35:43.170 --> 35:45.855
'CAUSE NOTHING'S
REALLY DIFFERENT.

35:49.000 --> 35:52.003
- HADDIE, SCARE ME HOW?

35:52.110 --> 35:53.486
NO.
HONEY, NO.

35:53.590 --> 35:56.798
I WOULD NEVER BE UPSET WITH YOU

39:35.640 --> 39:41.545
YOU WHO PROPHESIZE
WITH YOUR PEN

39:41.650 --> 39:43.129
KEEP YOUR EYES WIDE

39:43.240 --> 39:48.030
THE CHANCE
WON'T COME AGAIN

39:48.140 --> 39:51.200
AND DON'T SPEAK TOO SOON

39:51.310 --> 39:55.383
FOR THE WHEEL'S
STILL IN SPIN

39:59.770 --> 40:01.909
AND THERE'S NO TELLIN' WHO

DON'T CRITICIZE

40:36.260 --> 40:40.356
WHAT YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND

40:40.470 --> 40:43.530
YOUR SONS
AND YOUR DAUGHTERS

40:43.640 --> 40:48.191
ARE BEYOND YOUR COMMAND

40:52.100 --> 40:58.824
YOUR OLD ROAD

40:58.930 --> 41:02.275
SO PLEASE GET OUT
OF THE NEW ONE

41:02.390 --> 41:05.109

41:46.460 --> 41:49.873
THE COURSE, IT IS CAST

41:51.680 --> 41:54.808
THE SLOW ONE NOW

41:54.920 --> 41:58.128
WILL LATER BE FAST

41:58.230 --> 42:01.063
AS THE PRESENT NOW

42:01.170 --> 42:06.062
WILL LATER BE PAST

42:10.180 --> 42:11.829
THE ORDER

42:11.940 --> 42:16.764
IS RAPIDLY FADIN'

42:16.870 --> 42:20.419
AND THE FIRST ONE NOW
