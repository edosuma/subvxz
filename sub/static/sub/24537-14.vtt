00:37.200 --> 00:40.719
This is the most amazing thing that
has happened to me ever.

00:40.720 --> 00:44.359
The act with the most votes going to
to the final is...

00:44.360 --> 00:46.399

02:32.120 --> 02:34.159
Thanks, guys. See you in a bit.

02:34.160 --> 02:37.919
Welcome to our our fourth live
semifinal of the week

02:37.920 --> 02:40.119
and if the last three are anything
to go by,

02:40.120 --> 02:42.159
you are in for a treat tonight.

02:42.160 --> 02:46.439
By the end of it, two more acts will
win a place in our final

02:46.440 --> 02:49.199
and waiting for them there is the
prize of a lifetime -

02:49.200 --> 02:53.919
Â£250,000 and a spot on the bill at
the Royal Variety Performance.

02:53.920 --> 02:57.479
(CHEERING)
I know. It's a great prize.

02:57.480 --> 03:00.039
But I am getting ahead of myself, as
per.

03:00.040 --> 03:03.519
It's time to welcome four people who
talk complete and utter talent.

03:03.520 --> 03:07.159
It's the Britain's Got Talent judges.

Come on in. Thank you. Have a seat.

03:47.760 --> 03:49.759
Welcome, Simon.

03:49.760 --> 03:51.479
Great night last night.

03:51.480 --> 03:55.119
It was wonderful. It was a fabulous
semifinal. The only downside

03:55.120 --> 03:59.239
was we had to say goodbye to some
really good talent. I know.

03:59.240 --> 04:02.239
We did. But good news, guys. I have
news.

04:02.240 --> 04:07.240
Because this year there will be a
wildcard act in the final.

04:07.280 --> 04:10.039
Ohh! (CHEERING)

04:10.040 --> 04:12.319
After tomorrow night's show,

04:12.320 --> 04:15.239
you guys are going to get together
and choose a wildcard

04:15.240 --> 04:18.559
that'll make it into the final,
somebody who hasn't gone through.

04:18.560 --> 04:23.239
Can we have two? Why are you asking
him? You make the rules. Not any
more. Dec's in charge.

04:23.240 --> 04:26.199
I'm in charge now. Two, please. I
don't think we can.

04:26.200 --> 04:29.159
Yeah, come on. Can you think about
it? We can squeeze 'em in.

04:29.160 --> 04:32.719
I'm glad we've got a wildcard. I'm
glad too. Wildcard... S.

04:32.720 --> 04:35.079
Card... S. Let's see about that.
(LAUGHS)

04:35.080 --> 04:38.519
Thank you for the moment. Let's get
on with tonight's show.

04:38.520 --> 04:41.439
And we've got a cracking act to kick
us off.

04:41.440 --> 04:44.999
First up tonight is a lady from
Russia who plays a jaw harp

04:45.000 --> 04:47.959
and makes horse noises to a techno
soundtrack.

04:47.960 --> 04:51.119
Is it any wonder this show won a
BAFTA? (LAUGHTER)

04:51.120 --> 04:54.359
Ladies and gentlemen, Olena Uutai!
(CHEERING)

04:54.360 --> 04:56.360
(WARBLES)

04:59.120 --> 05:02.279
My name is Olena Uutai and I am
ethnic musician.

05:02.280 --> 05:07.280
My act, it's a very ancient Germanic
tradition of my culture.

05:07.600 --> 05:10.719
When I perform I am imitating the
sounds of nature.

05:10.720 --> 05:15.720
It can be horse. (NEIGHS)

05:15.800 --> 05:17.959
Birds. (SQUAWKS)

05:17.960 --> 05:19.400
(HOOTS)

05:24.000 --> 05:27.039
Nature is my main inspiration.

05:27.040 --> 05:29.319
We try to connect with mother
nature.

05:29.320 --> 05:34.320
For example, when I go to forest, I
can listen and it's music for me.

05:37.440 --> 05:42.119
It's my main mission of my life to
remind people who we are,

05:42.120 --> 05:44.159
to reconnect with mother nature.

05:44.160 --> 05:46.519
To love her, to appreciate her

05:46.520 --> 05:48.520
and, of course, to save her.

05:50.160 --> 05:52.999
I would love with all my heart and
soul

05:53.000 --> 05:55.039
to win the Britain's Got Talent.

05:55.040 --> 05:58.999
Tonight, I go on stage and I hope
that mother nature will be with me

05:59.000 --> 06:02.839
to help give my best performance of
my life.

06:02.840 --> 06:06.159

My God. I afraid of spiders.

08:24.760 --> 08:29.760
David, what did you think? Well,
that was by far

08:30.600 --> 08:33.119
the best act we've seen tonight.

08:33.120 --> 08:35.120
(LAUGHTER)

08:36.159 --> 08:41.159
Er... I'm not quite sure what we were
on when we put you through, but...

08:41.919 --> 08:45.679
this show is all about variety and
you brought something very special

08:45.680 --> 08:48.839
to the stage this evening, so thank
you very much. Thank you.

08:48.840 --> 08:50.840
(CHEERING)

08:52.600 --> 08:57.399
I don't know what it was, but it was
pretty good.

08:57.400 --> 08:59.439
I love that you and nature are one.

08:59.440 --> 09:02.599
I think we can all learn this while
brushing our teeth.

09:02.600 --> 09:05.359
It seems like something quite easy
to do. Always.

09:05.360 --> 09:08.479
I don't know what it is. It's great.
You make me smile.

09:08.480 --> 09:11.599
I like you. What can I say? Thank
you.

09:11.600 --> 09:13.639
Yeah, I mean, it is very odd.

09:13.640 --> 09:17.679
I thought I was just drinking water
this evening. (LAUGHTER)

09:17.680 --> 09:22.680
I feel like it could work in Ibiza
as some kind of dance album.

09:23.400 --> 09:27.039
And I feel like all I'm missing is
my glow sticks.

09:27.040 --> 09:29.879
Yeah. It was probably one of the
most surreal starts

09:29.880 --> 09:33.519
to Britain's Got Talent in 12 years.
So congratulations on that.

09:33.520 --> 09:35.600
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

09:40.240 --> 09:41.999
I think if um...

09:42.000 --> 09:44.919
we were putting music

09:44.920 --> 09:48.359
to Amanda Holden's wedding night,

09:48.360 --> 09:50.759
that's what it would have sounded
like. Oh!

09:50.760 --> 09:54.959
I'm taking that as a compliment.
Yeah, it was like... It was crazy.

09:54.960 --> 09:59.599
Look, there is a market for that
kind of thing. I don't think the
audience liked it much.

09:59.600 --> 10:02.480
I was kind of looking around.
(BOOING)

10:04.440 --> 10:07.559
But it's unique, original. That's
what this show is all about.

10:07.560 --> 10:11.639
Everyone's welcome. Every country.
Come on this show, do your own
thing.

10:11.640 --> 10:13.679
No-one else has done this before.

10:13.680 --> 10:17.519
After this week, anything could
happen. So good luck. Thank you.

Thank you, Olena.

10:19.920 --> 10:22.359
Come back. Don't go yet. Don't leave
me yet.

10:22.360 --> 10:24.839
I have to do your phone number. Oh!

10:24.840 --> 10:28.479
Here. If you want to vote for Olena,
the details are onscreen now.

10:28.480 --> 10:32.199
But the vote doesn't open till we've
seen the last act of the night.

10:32.200 --> 10:35.599
One more time, let's hear it for
tonight's opener - Olena Uutai.

10:35.600 --> 10:37.600
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

10:44.840 --> 10:47.119
Now, unless you've been living under
a rock -

10:47.120 --> 10:50.719
like that one there except not made
out of fibreglass - this week,

10:50.720 --> 10:53.039
you'll already be familiar
with the BGT app.

10:53.040 --> 10:56.199
In case you're not, let me tell you
it's got clips from the show,

10:56.200 --> 10:59.199

BGT buzzer.

10:59.200 --> 11:01.839
You can download it on your
smartphone or tablet.

11:01.840 --> 11:05.159
While you do that, we'll take a quick
break, but we'll be right back

11:05.160 --> 11:10.160

See you for that in a few minutes.

Welcome back to Britain's Got Talent

11:20.552 --> 11:23.951
and what is quite literally semifinal
number four.

11:23.952 --> 11:26.871
Next up tonight is a teenage opera
singer

11:26.872 --> 11:28.630
who delivered a fantastic audition

11:28.632 --> 11:30.911
after overcoming a serious case of
nerves.

11:30.912 --> 11:33.351
But there's no need for her to be
nervous tonight,

11:33.352 --> 11:36.431
here in this enormous theatre in
front of 3,000 people,

11:36.432 --> 11:39.391
live on national TV
with millions watching at home.

11:39.392 --> 11:43.431
I feel like I'm not really helping.
It's Amy Marie Borg. (CHEERING)

11:43.432 --> 11:47.192
My name is Amy Marie Borg, I am 16
years old and I'm from Malta.

11:49.112 --> 11:52.472
I live in Malta. I live with my mum,
my dad and my brother.

11:53.672 --> 11:57.872
I'm still in school, I study
photography, but I'd rather be
singing all day.

11:59.472 --> 12:01.951
I've been singing since about the
age of 12,

12:01.952 --> 12:04.872
but I only started opera about two
years ago.

12:06.072 --> 12:09.031
I love singing cos it is a way of
expressing yourself,

12:09.032 --> 12:10.991
but before I sing everything's a
blur.

12:10.992 --> 12:13.511
I can't focus on anything cos I'm so
nervous.

12:13.512 --> 12:16.951
On a scale of one to ten, how
nervous are you feeling right now?

12:16.952 --> 12:18.831
About a nine, I think.

12:18.832 --> 12:23.111
But when I start to sing, my nerves
disappear. I feel like a different
person.

(OPERATIC SINGING)

12:28.432 --> 12:29.711

12:29.712 --> 12:33.351
Getting that reaction from the
judges helped me gain confidence,

12:33.352 --> 12:35.111
which is something really new to me.

12:35.112 --> 12:38.591
It was like watching a caterpillar
turn into a butterfly.

12:38.592 --> 12:39.991

12:39.992 --> 12:42.471
It was a dream come true.

12:42.472 --> 12:45.111
My family are so supportive. I think
my brother

12:45.112 --> 12:47.672
will be really proud of me.
He's my biggest fan.

12:48.912 --> 12:52.751
Tonight, I'm gonna give everything
I've got. I'm gonna believe in
myself

12:52.752 --> 12:54.832
cos I really want to be in that
final.

are, you know.

15:32.672 --> 15:35.511
Apart from the fact that you have an
incredible voice,

15:35.512 --> 15:38.711
one of the things I enjoy most about
you is how emotional you get

15:38.712 --> 15:41.631
and how much honesty there is when
you sing.

15:41.632 --> 15:43.831
As you can see, you're crying your
eyes out.

15:43.832 --> 15:46.311

difficult.

So many words to squeeze in. I've
got no idea what it was about,

15:49.752 --> 15:53.311
but it was fantastic. (LAUGHTER)
Thank you. Well done.

15:53.312 --> 15:56.151
Thank you. Simon? AUDIENCE: Aw!

15:56.152 --> 15:58.152
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

16:02.832 --> 16:05.471
It's a relief, right?
Yeah, my legs are shaking.

16:05.472 --> 16:10.031
I have to tell you something. We
talked about your nerves the first
time we saw you.

16:10.032 --> 16:13.631
I think this is even more daunting.
But let me tell you something.

16:13.632 --> 16:16.511
Sometimes a stage like this can
swallow you up.

16:16.512 --> 16:20.831
You actually did the opposite, you
owned the stage during those two
minutes.

16:20.832 --> 16:23.871
Genuinely. (CHEERING)
You had so much...

16:23.872 --> 16:26.551
so much power and control.

16:26.552 --> 16:29.711
You absolutely controlled the whole
song.

16:29.712 --> 16:32.471
At the end you knew exactly
where you were.

16:32.472 --> 16:36.071
You hit the right note and,
ironically, you're nervous
afterwards.

16:36.072 --> 16:38.151
You've done the hard part. I'm
shaking.

16:38.152 --> 16:41.831
I have to say this. This show is not
just about recording contracts,

16:41.832 --> 16:43.631
{\an1}which we've spoken about before.

16:43.632 --> 16:45.991
It's about going forwards in your
career.

16:45.992 --> 16:48.551
I think that you're conquering your
nerves.

16:48.552 --> 16:52.991
I think you're gonna end up probably
in the West End or on Broadway

16:52.992 --> 16:55.311
cos you've got that charisma as
well.

16:55.312 --> 17:00.071
(CHEERING) Thank you. I really do. I
think it's an important moment in
your life, Amy.

17:00.072 --> 17:03.311
I genuinely do. And I love moments
like this

17:03.312 --> 17:06.871
when I see someone from the
auditions come into the semifinals,

17:06.872 --> 17:11.590
own it and grow - and that's what
you did. And you're 16 years old.
Bravo.

17:11.592 --> 17:13.592
Thank you. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

17:16.152 --> 17:20.751
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, you are so
lovable

17:20.752 --> 17:23.511
and that was so beautiful and
emotional.

17:23.512 --> 17:27.751
We don't know anything about opera,
we have no idea what you were
singing about,

17:27.752 --> 17:32.752
but we really connected with what
you were singing. That's the power
of your voice. Well done.

17:33.712 --> 17:37.031
Thank you. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
Well done. How do you feel?

17:37.032 --> 17:39.951
I'm still shaking a bit. Still
shaking. Yeah. Relief?

17:39.952 --> 17:42.311
Yeah, a bit, yeah. Well done.

17:42.312 --> 17:45.831
You absolutely smashed it. If you
think Amy should come back on Sunday

17:45.832 --> 17:48.351
for the final, all the details are
onscreen now.

17:48.352 --> 17:50.951
But the vote doesn't open
until the end of the show.

17:50.952 --> 17:53.351
Let's hear it for her one more time -
Amy Marie Borg!

17:53.352 --> 17:56.192
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
Thank you. Well done.

18:05.152 --> 18:07.471
Time for a break,
but we'll be right back

18:07.472 --> 18:10.111
with Welsh funnyman Noel James

18:10.112 --> 18:12.951
and disturbing dance crew Baba Yega.

18:12.952 --> 18:14.952
See you in a few minutes. (CHEERING)

18:19.206 --> 18:21.206
(CHEERING)

18:21.945 --> 18:25.504
Welcome back live to Britain's Got
Talent, where the race is on

18:25.505 --> 18:27.840
to win a place in this year's final.

18:27.842 --> 18:31.081
Now, next up tonight is a Welsh
comedian

18:31.082 --> 18:33.121
whose audition went down a storm.

18:33.122 --> 18:35.921
I asked him how he wanted me to
introduce him tonight

18:35.922 --> 18:38.242
and he said, "Just say something
funny."

18:39.762 --> 18:41.762
Um... (LAUGHTER)

18:43.362 --> 18:45.362
Kn... knickers?

18:46.442 --> 18:48.242
It's Noel James.

18:49.282 --> 18:51.282
(SPEAKS WELSH)

18:56.682 --> 19:00.201
I was born and brought up in the
Swansea Valley

19:00.202 --> 19:04.882
and I have always been proud to be
from Wales.

19:07.282 --> 19:10.481
There was a lot of things going on
in Wales on different levels.

19:10.482 --> 19:14.281
That's because most people live in a
lift. Um, but...

19:14.282 --> 19:16.321
That was a joke, by the way.

19:16.322 --> 19:19.401
Levels? OK, forget it. Arh!

19:19.402 --> 19:22.361
I've done comedy for at least 25
years.

19:22.362 --> 19:24.481
You wouldn't believe it to look at
me.

19:24.482 --> 19:28.081
I get three four gigs a week.
Sometimes I get bad weeks.

19:28.082 --> 19:30.561
Sheep solo. Baaa!

19:30.562 --> 19:34.001
I was unsure about taking part in
Britain's Got Talent

19:34.002 --> 19:36.281
because I saw it as a gamble.

19:36.282 --> 19:39.841
I mean, you're so stupid in the best
way. (LAUGHTER)

19:39.842 --> 19:43.241
That was one of the most
unbelievable moments of my life.

19:43.242 --> 19:47.081
My entire comedy career has led up
to this moment.

19:47.082 --> 19:49.801
Every good gig I've done, every bad
gig I've done.

19:49.802 --> 19:54.641
I would really love to be a popular
comedian in this country.

19:54.642 --> 19:58.041
Be able to be gigging every week in
nice theatres.

19:58.042 --> 20:00.081
I'd love to travel. I'd love to
do...

20:00.082 --> 20:03.161
Sorry, is this too much?
(WOMAN LAUGHS)

20:03.162 --> 20:05.162
(CHEERING) Thank you.

20:06.522 --> 20:10.001
Thank you very much, ladies and
gentlemen. Thank you.

20:10.002 --> 20:13.961
(WHISTLING AND APPLAUSE) Good
evening. Thank you so much.

20:13.962 --> 20:17.121
Well, what a pleasure it is and also
what a relief it is

20:17.122 --> 20:20.721
to be in this theatre tonight
because when they initially told me

20:20.722 --> 20:22.761
I was going to be in the Apollo,

20:22.762 --> 20:25.961
I thought we had to take a mission
to the moon. (LAUGHTER)

20:25.962 --> 20:29.441
There is no atmosphere for comedy up
there, do you know what I mean?

20:29.442 --> 20:32.761
Are you well? ALL: Yes!

20:32.762 --> 20:35.201
That's good cos I tell you what, I'm
No-el.

20:47.922 --> 20:50.001
I'm one of the big names on
the comedy scene.

20:50.002 --> 20:52.121
(LAUGHTER)

20:52.122 --> 20:55.721
For those of you who still don't
know where my accent is from,

20:55.722 --> 20:59.561
it's from my mouth. (LAUGHTER)

20:59.562 --> 21:01.681
Let me tell you about my
background.

21:01.682 --> 21:04.442
It's um... it's a brick wall.
(LAUGHTER)

21:05.722 --> 21:09.922
It's a very tough background.
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

21:12.682 --> 21:16.681
And that's no surprise. I was raised
by dolphins

21:16.682 --> 21:19.881
Yeah. (LAUGHTER) Dolphins. And when
I look back, even today,

21:19.882 --> 21:22.001
I still sometimes think to myself...

21:22.002 --> 21:24.561
I think...
(IMITATES DOLPHIN CLICKING)

21:24.562 --> 21:26.441
(LAUGHTER)

21:26.442 --> 21:29.001
That's not Welsh, by the way.

21:29.002 --> 21:32.161
Cos dolphins don't speak Welsh,
only... WHALES.

21:32.162 --> 21:34.162
Listen... (LAUGHTER)

21:35.562 --> 21:37.562
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

21:42.042 --> 21:44.441
I come from a long line of
comedians.

21:44.442 --> 21:48.521
You can still see them
outside the job centre. (LAUGHTER)

21:48.522 --> 21:50.881
It's a very difficult job, comedian.

21:50.882 --> 21:53.401
Last week I was so desperate for a
laugh

21:53.402 --> 21:56.802
I tried to eat some baked beans
through my eyes.

21:57.882 --> 22:00.161
And I wasn't funny at all.

22:00.162 --> 22:01.841
In fact, I went blind.

22:01.842 --> 22:03.881
I'm joking. I could still see things

22:03.882 --> 22:06.682
but only in 'Heinz-sight'.
(LAUGHTER)

22:08.522 --> 22:10.522
I er...

22:14.722 --> 22:17.841
I've done other jobs. I bet you wish
I was doing one right now.

22:17.842 --> 22:20.721
I... (LAUGHTER) I used to work on a
fish farm

22:20.722 --> 22:24.481
until the tractor sank. (LAUGHTER)

22:24.482 --> 22:27.521
Oh, we were all gutted. And then I
was... (LAUGHTER)

22:27.522 --> 22:30.401
I was working in a bowling alley.
That was a TEN-PIN job...

22:30.402 --> 22:32.841
(LAUGHTER)

22:32.842 --> 22:34.641
..until the strike.

22:34.642 --> 22:36.681
(LAUGHTER)

22:36.682 --> 22:39.961
For many years I was a night packer.

22:39.962 --> 22:43.201
That's tricky work getting darkness
into boxes...

22:43.202 --> 22:45.041
(LAUGHTER)

22:45.042 --> 22:47.401
..and then selling it on the black
market.

22:47.402 --> 22:49.121
(LAUGHTER)

22:49.122 --> 22:52.641
But when I was 17, what I really
wanted to be,

22:52.642 --> 22:54.681
I wanted to be Vincent van Gogh.

22:54.682 --> 22:56.721
So I took a year off...

22:56.722 --> 22:58.722
and... (LAUGHTER)

23:00.922 --> 23:02.922
(APPLAUSE) ..I...

23:07.602 --> 23:09.881
..I joined a circus.

23:09.882 --> 23:12.681
I was a trampolinist for six months.

23:12.682 --> 23:14.641
Well, 12 months on and off.

23:14.642 --> 23:16.881
(LAUGHTER)

23:16.882 --> 23:18.801
I was a very good ventriloquist

23:18.802 --> 23:21.161
even if I make somebody else say so
myself

23:21.162 --> 23:25.521
and... (LAUGHTER) ..of course I am
an impressionist,

23:25.522 --> 23:27.841
just like Vincent van Gogh.

23:27.842 --> 23:30.641
And last week...
AUDIENCE MEMBER: No!

23:30.642 --> 23:34.681
..I was so desperate for a laugh, I
tried to impersonate a frog.

23:34.682 --> 23:36.682
See if you think this is funny.

23:39.802 --> 23:41.802
(LAUGHTER)

23:44.562 --> 23:46.921
(LAUGHTER)

23:46.922 --> 23:48.922
(APPLAUSE)

23:55.482 --> 23:58.841
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'd like
to finish my career now

23:58.842 --> 24:03.041
with... (LAUGHTER) ..with a funny
impression.

24:03.042 --> 24:05.401
Why not? It's a semifinal. Come on.

24:05.402 --> 24:07.402
(WHOOPING)

24:09.722 --> 24:12.601
But can I also just take this
opportunity

24:12.602 --> 24:16.201
to say thanks awfully to everyone?

24:16.202 --> 24:18.241
(LISPS) Sanks... (BLOWS RASPBERRY)

24:24.402 --> 24:26.721
And now, finally,

24:26.722 --> 24:29.801
here's my favourite actor, one of my
favourite actors.

24:29.802 --> 24:33.041
Ladies and gentlemen, it's Robert De
Niro.

24:33.042 --> 24:35.042
Thank you. I've got it. I've got it.

(LAUGHTER)

24:53.482 --> 24:55.601
(LAUGHTER)

24:55.602 --> 24:57.641
I can't do the voice.

24:57.642 --> 24:59.642
(LAUGHTER)

25:02.082 --> 25:04.082
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

25:13.682 --> 25:16.402
That was brilliant. Come into the
centre.

25:18.962 --> 25:20.841
Amanda, let's start with you.

25:20.842 --> 25:24.801
Noel, I... you were one my favourites
in the auditions

25:24.802 --> 25:27.481
because of what Alesha said, because
you are so silly.

25:27.482 --> 25:30.961
But what I loved about those jokes
was I was laughing at one

25:30.962 --> 25:32.841
and the next one came and the next
one.

25:32.842 --> 25:36.761
It was like a domino run of lines
and comedy gags.

25:36.762 --> 25:39.401
(CHEERING) Really cleverly written.

25:39.402 --> 25:43.321
And can I say, you've had a
wonderful makeover.

25:43.322 --> 25:47.761
You've scrubbed up very well this
evening. (WHOOPING) You look good.

25:47.762 --> 25:52.441
Noel, what was the reaction from
everyone where you work after the
first audition?

25:52.442 --> 25:56.881
Er... you mean the invigilating
scene?

25:56.882 --> 25:59.521
Yeah. They just said, 'Ssh!'

25:59.522 --> 26:03.962
(LAUGHTER) It's kind of an in joke.
But I get it. I was just curious.

26:05.242 --> 26:09.481
Look, I always say this is a tough
gig when you're doing stand-up.

26:09.482 --> 26:11.641
I think that you came over really
well.

26:11.642 --> 26:15.521
The second half was better than the
first half when you got confident.

26:15.522 --> 26:20.201
But this is not my thing. David, I'm
curious to see what advice you'd
give him.

26:20.202 --> 26:24.401
I absolutely loved it. There's no
advice to give him. He's hilarious.

26:24.402 --> 26:27.761
(CHEERING) Your experience shone
through.

26:27.762 --> 26:30.881
I know you've been working as a
comedian for a long time.

26:30.882 --> 26:34.161
I'm really pleased that this show
has given you the exposure.

26:34.162 --> 26:36.881
I think you could be in the final
and go all the way.

26:36.882 --> 26:41.001
You deserve to be one of the biggest
stars on British TV, no doubt about
it.

26:41.002 --> 26:45.801
(CHEERING) I love you. I'm just
pointing out the obvious.

26:45.802 --> 26:50.241
So silly. Everyone's going to love
you. You did brilliantly well. Good
for you.

26:50.242 --> 26:52.001
Thank you very much. (CHEERING)

26:52.002 --> 26:55.121
The details on how to vote for Noel
are onscreen now.

26:55.122 --> 26:57.641
You can't vote until
we've seen all eight acts.

26:57.642 --> 27:00.482
One more time - Noel James!
Thank you very much.

27:09.882 --> 27:14.401
Next up tonight are five fit and
flexible men in black latex onesies.

27:14.402 --> 27:18.041
No, it's not David Walliams's ideal
Friday night,

27:18.042 --> 27:22.281
it is, in fact, the weird and
wonderful Baba Yega. (CHEERING)

27:22.282 --> 27:24.282
(WHOOSHING)

27:27.162 --> 27:29.881
News just in. There's been reports
of sightings

27:29.882 --> 27:32.161
of strange creatures invading
London.

27:32.162 --> 27:35.161
I've just seen these creatures. They
came out of a phone box.

27:35.162 --> 27:37.881
They were wearing shell suits from
the '80s.

27:37.882 --> 27:39.962
I've never seen anything like it!

27:42.122 --> 27:44.122
And I've been around the block.

27:48.842 --> 27:52.281
So, I've just seen these aliens
coming out of Piccadilly Circus.

27:52.282 --> 27:56.081
They were running around looking
lost, but they're fascinating.

27:56.082 --> 27:57.961
I mean, absolutely spectacular.

27:57.962 --> 28:00.922
I guess it's London so, you know,
weird stuff happens.

28:05.482 --> 28:09.681
They came right up to me. I was
like, 'W-w-whoa. Wow. OK.'

28:09.682 --> 28:13.081
This. This is what they were doing
to me. What's that all about?

28:13.082 --> 28:17.281
Apparently, the strange visitors are
actually trying to find their way

28:17.282 --> 28:21.361
to the Britain's Got Talent
semifinals. They come in peace.

28:21.362 --> 28:23.841
They came up to me, shook my hand.

28:23.842 --> 28:26.761
One of them even touched my hair.

28:26.762 --> 28:29.321
I mean, we get visitors from all
over the planet,

28:29.322 --> 28:32.642
but these people, they were from
another world.

OK, this is going to get...

Oh, for Christ's sake. (LAUGHTER)

31:28.002 --> 31:30.561
(CHEERING) I had a feeling. I was
going to say,

31:30.562 --> 31:34.321
'Don't try and be funny afterwards.'
Right, I'll make this simple.

31:34.322 --> 31:38.241

first audition, I liked.

32:06.722 --> 32:09.081
It's very weird even by my

32:09.082 --> 32:11.921
But I found it very enjoyable. Thank
you very much.

32:11.922 --> 32:14.841
Thank you. I'm the nice one. Thank
you.

how much I love you.

32:24.282 --> 32:27.081

more.

You know? And you didn't quite
deliver that tonight.

32:30.482 --> 32:33.481
You see, this is the side of you I
really love.

32:33.482 --> 32:35.721

imaginative. (CHEERING)

The production was fantastic.
The choreography was great.

32:55.522 --> 32:59.721

you in the auditions,

32:59.722 --> 33:03.241

Next up tonight are Simon's Golden
Buzzer act, Jack and Tim.

34:10.996 --> 34:14.275
Do you remember the first talent
show that you went for?

34:14.277 --> 34:16.716
I did Rolling On The River by Tina
Turner.

34:16.717 --> 34:19.596
I played, and you sang -
I did the harmonica!

34:19.597 --> 34:21.636
You did the harmonica solo.

34:21.637 --> 34:23.636
Now you're in the semi-final.

34:23.637 --> 34:25.556
Jack was a very quiet baby,
wasn't he?

34:25.556 --> 34:28.916
Until you found music. I remember
when you were in Mum's tummy,

34:28.917 --> 34:31.356
your mum's tummy looked like a
microphone.

34:31.357 --> 34:35.876
(LAUGHS) So I used to sing to you
through Mum's bellybutton.

34:35.877 --> 34:37.916

34:37.917 --> 34:39.956
That is so weird!

all.

I think my heart stopped for a
moment, then.

34:46.677 --> 34:51.396
It was pretty incredible. Lily and
I, we were just crying so much for
you.

34:51.397 --> 34:54.956
Simon Cowell cuddled you.
Cuddled me.

34:54.956 --> 34:57.116

34:57.117 --> 34:59.117
You haven't!

35:02.037 --> 35:05.676

You are like two peas in a pod.

35:05.677 --> 35:07.356
Yeah.
Yeah.

35:07.357 --> 35:10.556
Are you excited? Yeah.
I know you can do it.

35:10.557 --> 35:12.476
I'm looking forward to doing it.

two when you perform.

I mean, genuinely. We've had,
you know, dad and son,

38:07.277 --> 38:10.676
and mum and sons, and it can be a
little bit corny.

38:10.677 --> 38:14.356
This is not corny. Obviously you
have this amazing chemistry.

38:14.357 --> 38:16.876
You wrote the song yourself,
which is really brave,

38:16.877 --> 38:18.916

see you in the final

actually

you perform, I feel good.

comes from you.

what people say the music business
is all about.

Because, for me, when you're good,
you're good.

And actually, you're interesting as
well.

38:50.557 --> 38:52.756

tonight.

it was like we all knew it.

And this wasn't a performance to try
and get in the final,

concert.

39:10.877 --> 39:13.276
It was very assured,
very professional,

I think.

39:34.077 --> 39:35.916
And it's you, you've got star
quality.

39:35.917 --> 39:38.516

how it feels to be up here with each
other? No.

39:48.317 --> 39:50.356
OK.

audition

40:20.117 --> 40:22.916
had the whole theatre on the edge of
their seats.

40:22.917 --> 40:25.876
And this is a guy who really performs
on the edge -

40:25.877 --> 40:27.996
the edge of a wobbly metal tube.

40:27.997 --> 40:31.076
Please don't try this at home,
put your wobbly tubes away.

Sascha Williams.

a rola bola balancing act.

40:39.117 --> 40:41.916
Circus performing definitely runs in
my blood.

40:41.917 --> 40:44.956
My parents were acrobats,
my cousin's a juggler,

40:44.957 --> 40:48.436
my grandfather was a wirewalker,
grandmother's a contortionist.

40:48.437 --> 40:52.396
The list goes on. Rola bola is the
only act my parents let me practise

40:52.397 --> 40:54.836
that wasn't too dangerous -
they thought.

40:54.837 --> 40:56.876
But then I took it to another level.

40:56.877 --> 40:59.916
My act's pretty dangerous.

40:59.917 --> 41:01.917
It's got a mind of its own.

41:03.357 --> 41:05.596
When people freak out and start
screaming

41:05.597 --> 41:08.796
it's the best feeling ever cos you
know you're doing your job right.

41:08.797 --> 41:12.156
I've been doing rola bola for 17
years.

41:12.157 --> 41:15.476
I've broken bones,
I've had concussion,

41:15.477 --> 41:16.796
stitches across my head.

41:16.797 --> 41:19.996
I think I'm on 20 hospitals now
all over the world.

41:19.997 --> 41:21.997
Pretty proud of that. (CHUCKLES)

41:25.037 --> 41:27.716
This is one of the biggest moments
in my life.

41:27.717 --> 41:30.796
It would be awesome to be the first
circus act to win.

41:30.797 --> 41:33.236
I'd love to perform
for the Royal Family.

41:33.237 --> 41:34.476
I think they'd enjoy it.

41:34.477 --> 41:36.516
I reckon I'd get them pretty scared.

41:36.517 --> 41:40.076
Tonight I need to make sure
everything goes right.

41:40.077 --> 41:42.636

I've ever done.

who spent hours telling us

how dangerous it was gonna be,
literally hours,

his head with a bit of water.

45:46.037 --> 45:50.956
(LAUGHTER) You said nothing
and just set fire to yourself

45:50.957 --> 45:54.756
and played guitar, nearly broke your
neck three times,

45:54.757 --> 45:58.716
and it was like, that's it. And
that's what's so cool about you.

45:58.717 --> 46:00.916
And you also reminded me in the VT

46:00.917 --> 46:04.996
that this is an act we hopefully
will put in front of the Royal
Family.

46:04.997 --> 46:08.676
It was so cool. This is the most
dangerous act genuinely

46:08.677 --> 46:11.756
we've seen on this show. I think
it's the hardest thing to do.

46:11.757 --> 46:15.156
(CHEERING) And you have to be
slightly crackers

46:15.157 --> 46:19.836
to do it and you do it in a
very, very entertaining way.

46:19.837 --> 46:23.436
Erm, I really, really like you
and I think you have deserved,

46:23.437 --> 46:25.836
on the back of that,
I really do think

46:25.837 --> 46:29.076
you deserve a place in the final.
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

46:29.077 --> 46:32.036
I agree. I mean, who'd have thought

46:32.037 --> 46:36.196
that wobbling on top of things would
be so entertaining? But it was.

46:36.197 --> 46:38.596
And it's also very brave
of you because you thought,

46:38.597 --> 46:41.556
"Today shall I wear the tartan
trousers or the black trousers?

46:41.557 --> 46:46.196
Wear both!" That's how brave you
are. So well done.

46:46.197 --> 46:47.916
Thank you very much, judges.

46:47.917 --> 46:51.436
If you want to vote for Sascha,
all the details are onscreen now.

46:51.437 --> 46:54.876
But not yet. Voting doesn't open till
the end of the show.

46:54.877 --> 46:58.756
One more time, let's hear it for him
- the dangerous Sascha Williams.

46:58.757 --> 47:00.757
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

47:07.757 --> 47:11.476
Time for another break, but we'll be
right back with looney tune inventor

47:11.477 --> 47:12.996
Marty Putz.

47:12.997 --> 47:15.876
And if you want to win some
incredible prizes for yourself,

47:15.877 --> 47:17.916
have a look at this.

47:17.917 --> 47:21.836
It's another chance for you at home
to win a life-changing Â£100,000

47:21.837 --> 47:23.956
from the comfort of your living room.

47:23.957 --> 47:26.396
It's the biggest cash prize we've
ever given away.

47:26.397 --> 47:29.516
And the best bit is, you don't even
need a talent to win it.

47:29.517 --> 47:31.636
All this lot did was pick up the
phone.

47:31.637 --> 47:35.236
You could be just like them -
really lucky and a lot richer.

47:35.237 --> 47:37.556
I couldn't believe it.
Over the moon.

47:37.557 --> 47:38.876
Real people do win, yeah.

47:38.877 --> 47:40.877
For your chance to win -

48:05.397 --> 48:07.397
Good luck!

48:10.284 --> 48:12.284
(CHEERING)

48:12.551 --> 48:14.550
Welcome back to Britain's Got Talent.

48:14.551 --> 48:17.536
I've popped up to see some of the
acts who have already performed.

48:17.538 --> 48:19.457
Good job, everybody,
and I have to say

48:19.458 --> 48:21.855
you've all scrubbed up very nicely.

48:21.857 --> 48:24.856
Which is no mean feat, because some
of you looked a right state

48:24.857 --> 48:27.696
at your auditions. (LAUGHS)
I'm only joking.

48:27.697 --> 48:32.176
He's not. Our next act is a man who
provided one of THE finest moments

48:32.177 --> 48:35.136
of this year's auditions when he
covered Simon Cowell's head

48:35.137 --> 48:38.697
in toilet roll. Good times.
It's Marty Putz!

48:40.257 --> 48:43.177
I'm Marty Putz and I am
an inventor-comedian.

48:45.417 --> 48:48.776
My mother's from Liverpool and
my father was from Lancaster,

48:48.777 --> 48:51.736
but they met in Canada and that's
where I was born.

48:51.737 --> 48:55.376
My grandfather was an inventor so I
spent a lot of time

48:55.377 --> 48:57.496
with him as a little boy,
building things.

48:57.497 --> 49:00.376
I remember my first invention.

49:00.377 --> 49:03.136
I was in Grade One
and it was a guitar

49:03.137 --> 49:05.297
made out of a steak and kidney pie
tin.

49:06.617 --> 49:10.256
From there, I just started building
strange things

49:10.257 --> 49:13.417
and I've been doing this act for
about 25 years now.

49:14.577 --> 49:16.616
I love to make people laugh

49:16.617 --> 49:19.856
because when you laugh,
nothing else matters in the world.

49:19.857 --> 49:20.936
There you go!

49:20.937 --> 49:24.176
When I did my audition and I covered
Simon with toilet paper,

49:24.177 --> 49:27.336
I remember talking to my friends,
"You know what I should do?"

49:27.337 --> 49:30.416
And everybody's going,
"No, no. It's Simon."

49:30.417 --> 49:33.497
And I went, "Everybody loves to have
fun."

49:34.697 --> 49:36.976
I am so excited to be
in the semi-finals

49:37.108 --> 49:40.747
because I now get a chance to show
more of my stuff

49:40.748 --> 49:43.307
and some of it's never been seen
before,

49:43.308 --> 49:45.388
that I designed specifically for
this show.

49:46.788 --> 49:49.547
Tonight is gonna be one giant
Marty's party

49:49.548 --> 49:51.787
and everyone is gonna have a blast.

49:51.788 --> 49:53.788
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

49:55.548 --> 49:57.787
# RIDE OF THE VALKYRIES #
Hey, you guys!

49:57.788 --> 50:00.107
I'm so excited to be here.

50:00.108 --> 50:03.347
I'm so excited to show you one of my
earliest inventions

50:03.348 --> 50:05.427
that I've been working on for ten
years.

50:05.428 --> 50:08.147
Ever since I was a little boy,
I wanted to fly.

50:08.148 --> 50:13.148
So tonight, it's the premiere launch
of this - the Putz 2000 jetpack.

50:15.028 --> 50:19.187
(CHEERING)
Now, please, let me -

50:19.188 --> 50:22.467
I have to tell you the producers
have asked me

50:22.468 --> 50:26.107
please, for your safety and mine,
as I circle above your heads,

50:26.108 --> 50:30.507
do not try to reach up and grab me
or high-five me.

50:30.508 --> 50:32.267
Are you ready?

50:32.268 --> 50:34.427
AUDIENCE: Yes!

50:34.428 --> 50:36.668
Let's do it.

50:43.268 --> 50:45.268
(ALARM)

50:46.908 --> 50:51.547
Five... four... three... two... one.

50:51.548 --> 50:53.548
Ignition.

50:57.748 --> 50:59.748
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)

51:03.508 --> 51:05.508
(CHEERING AND LAUGHTER)

51:06.788 --> 51:08.827
(YELLS)

51:08.828 --> 51:10.867
(HISSING)

51:10.868 --> 51:12.868
(GROANS)

51:14.548 --> 51:16.587
Oh, man!

51:16.588 --> 51:19.107
Can I have my jacket, please?

51:19.108 --> 51:21.627
It's a good thing I didn't get that
tattoo.

51:21.628 --> 51:23.667
(LAUGHTER)

51:23.668 --> 51:27.187
I have some... a few more
cool inventions to show you.

51:27.188 --> 51:28.907
I'm so excited to be here!

51:28.908 --> 51:33.747
Hey, I've got to tell you, one of my
first jobs when I was in high school

51:33.748 --> 51:36.067
working part-time,
was delivering pizza.

51:36.068 --> 51:38.187
But I got fired after the first
night.

51:38.188 --> 51:41.867
It was accidental, but let me show
you. This is great.

51:41.868 --> 51:45.187
I used to go up, knock on the door,
"Ma'am, sir, pizza."

51:45.188 --> 51:47.187
When they'd answer, I'd do this -

51:47.188 --> 51:49.188
(YELLS)
(LAUGHTER)

51:52.108 --> 51:54.108
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

51:55.508 --> 51:58.827
And in Grade Two, when all my
friends were sharpening their
pencils,

51:58.828 --> 52:02.067
I was doing this. Check it out.
(LAUGHS)

52:02.068 --> 52:04.068
It's the coolest, look.

52:06.188 --> 52:08.188
(YELLS)

52:12.268 --> 52:14.307
Yeah...
(LAUGHTER)

52:14.308 --> 52:16.347
(APPLAUSE)

52:16.348 --> 52:18.667
I know, looking sharp.

52:18.668 --> 52:20.947
(LAUGHTER)
I'll get to the point.

52:20.948 --> 52:23.627
Wait, wait!

52:23.628 --> 52:26.427
You guys, how many of you love
marshmallows?

52:26.428 --> 52:28.467
(CHEERING)

52:28.468 --> 52:31.667
This is cool. I've invented a
great game with marshmallows.

52:31.668 --> 52:34.627
Whatever you do, when you get one,
don't eat it. Hang onto it.

52:34.628 --> 52:36.787
Right there.
Hang onto it, right there.

52:36.788 --> 52:39.587
Simon, hang onto it right there.
That one...

52:39.588 --> 52:41.947
(LAUGHTER) All right.
Right there, Alesha.

52:41.948 --> 52:46.507
Nice! David, do me a favour. Grab
these, there you go. Good job.

52:46.508 --> 52:49.187
Amanda, I love you. Have another.

52:49.188 --> 52:52.707
I love you. Take them all.
They're all yours.

52:52.708 --> 52:56.627
All right, everybody who has a
marshmallow, hold it up high.

52:56.628 --> 52:59.147
Hold it up high. This is awesome.

52:59.148 --> 53:04.148
Because right now it's
time for a game of -

53:05.188 --> 53:07.507
Oh, yeah, check this out, you guys -

53:07.508 --> 53:10.387
human baseball!

53:10.388 --> 53:13.987
(LAUGHTER) David, let's start
with you. Stand up, please.

53:13.988 --> 53:16.027
(LAUGHTER)

53:16.028 --> 53:18.067
All right. All right...

53:18.068 --> 53:20.107
(CHEERING)

53:20.108 --> 53:23.507
All right, Amanda. We've gotta get
one, gotta get one. Come on, Amanda.

53:23.508 --> 53:25.547
You can do it.

53:25.548 --> 53:27.548
Yes!
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

53:29.148 --> 53:31.907
All right, Simon, chuck it in here.
Really...

53:31.908 --> 53:34.627
(LAUGHTER)
Ow!

53:34.628 --> 53:37.948
All right, who else has one?
Who else has? Let's go. (BUZZER)

53:39.828 --> 53:43.067
All right, we're going. Let's go!

53:43.068 --> 53:45.068
Check that out!

53:47.068 --> 53:49.107
Oh, yeah!
(WIND TURBINE BLOWING)

53:49.108 --> 53:51.147
(BUZZER)

53:51.148 --> 53:53.187
Help me!

53:53.188 --> 53:55.227
(ALARM)

53:55.228 --> 53:57.267
(SOUND OF EXPLOSIONS)

53:57.268 --> 53:59.268
(INDISTINCT)

54:00.668 --> 54:05.387
All right. Nice job. That's it,
let's take them home.

54:05.388 --> 54:07.388
Oh, yeah...

54:09.268 --> 54:12.307
Here we go... oh, yeah.

54:12.308 --> 54:14.347
There we go. Hang on.

54:14.348 --> 54:16.748
Say hello to my little friend!

54:17.748 --> 54:19.787
(EXPLOSIONS)

54:19.788 --> 54:21.827
(LAUGHTER AND GASPING)

54:21.828 --> 54:23.828
(APPLAUSE)

54:25.228 --> 54:27.267
(BUZZER)

54:27.268 --> 54:29.268
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

54:32.628 --> 54:35.387
I think you've got to help them out.
All right, let's do it.

54:35.388 --> 54:37.427
Come on, Dec.

54:37.428 --> 54:39.667
They got a little wet.

54:39.668 --> 54:42.147
There we go. Let's take care of 'em.

54:42.148 --> 54:44.187
There we go.

54:44.188 --> 54:46.188
(WHIRRING)

55:03.028 --> 55:05.028
Woo-hoo!

55:11.508 --> 55:13.547
(BUZZER)

55:13.548 --> 55:15.548
(GROANING, LAUGHTER, JEERING)

55:19.588 --> 55:21.627
Thank you, guys.

55:21.628 --> 55:23.667
Come on over, Marty.

55:23.668 --> 55:26.627
We've lost two of the judges.
We've lost all four, in fact.

55:26.628 --> 55:28.667
(LAUGHTER)

55:28.668 --> 55:30.668
Er, Simon? (LAUGHS)

55:32.468 --> 55:34.507
Thank you.

55:34.508 --> 55:36.508
(WILD CHEERING)

55:45.148 --> 55:47.187
This isn't what I signed up for.

55:47.188 --> 55:50.627
David?
Well, I mean...

55:50.628 --> 55:52.667
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

55:52.668 --> 55:54.668
(LAUGHTER)

56:07.988 --> 56:12.187
It's gone down incredibly well with
the judges, so congratulations!

56:12.188 --> 56:15.067
Do you know what?
I'm a big kid at heart

56:15.068 --> 56:17.027
and I know lots of kids
watch this show

56:17.028 --> 56:19.227
and I think they're gonna absolutely
love you.

56:19.228 --> 56:21.427
Because that was mayhem.

56:21.428 --> 56:24.627
(CHEERING)
Mayhem. You're a funny man

56:24.628 --> 56:28.347
and you're a very, very brave man
to soak us all

56:28.348 --> 56:31.307
and cover us in toilet roll.
Alesha, did you like it?

56:31.308 --> 56:34.427
I had a good flush, yeah.
Thank you very much.

56:34.428 --> 56:36.467
Amanda?

56:36.468 --> 56:41.067
I'm gonna send you the dry cleaning
bill. But erm... (LAUGHTER)

56:41.068 --> 56:43.547
Yeah, I mean, it's good fun.

56:43.548 --> 56:47.227
It's clowning at its best. I tried
to bring families together. Exactly.

56:47.228 --> 56:50.787
And somewhere, somebody enjoyed
that.

56:50.788 --> 56:52.788
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

57:01.108 --> 57:03.348
Amazing.
(LAUGHTER)

57:04.548 --> 57:09.387
In one word. Look, I think for
Eric's fifth birthday party,

57:09.388 --> 57:12.027
brilliant. Erm...
(LAUGHTER)

57:12.028 --> 57:14.467
Perhaps the ending was better than
the beginning...

57:14.468 --> 57:17.868
I can't sit down.
I know, it's soaking.

57:18.868 --> 57:20.387
Great. That's it.
Thank you.

57:20.388 --> 57:22.427
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

57:22.428 --> 57:27.267
Marty... to vote for Marty,
follow the details onscreen

57:27.268 --> 57:30.427
but not yet. The vote doesn't open
till we've seen all eight acts.

57:30.428 --> 57:32.547
One more time, let's hear it for
Marty Putz.

57:32.548 --> 57:34.548
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

57:41.628 --> 57:45.427
While the judges dry off and we start
our clean-up operation

57:45.428 --> 57:46.987
we're gonna take a quick break.

57:46.988 --> 57:49.587
But we'll be right back with the last
act of the night,

57:49.588 --> 57:52.427
street dance supremos DVJ.

57:52.428 --> 57:55.188
(CHEERING) See you for that in a few
minutes.

57:57.148 --> 57:59.787
Showtime!
Oh, my God!

57:59.788 --> 58:02.347
Auditions for the next series of
Britain's Got Talent

58:02.348 --> 58:04.387
are open right now.

58:04.388 --> 58:05.907
Why don't you just give it a go?

58:05.908 --> 58:09.067
You may be an incredible dancer,

58:09.068 --> 58:12.147
an unbelievable singer,
an amazing comedian.

58:12.148 --> 58:14.827
If you have a dream,
you can make it happen.

58:14.828 --> 58:18.787
We make shows like this
to find people like you.

58:18.788 --> 58:22.747
Anybody out there thinking of coming
to Britain's Got Talent,

58:22.748 --> 58:24.667
don't think about it - just do it.

58:24.668 --> 58:28.174
Apply now. It might just change your
life together.

58:30.289 --> 58:32.289
(APPLAUSE AND CHEERING)

58:33.929 --> 58:37.368
Welcome back to the fourth semi-final
of Britain's Got Talent.

58:37.369 --> 58:40.607
There is seven down and one to go.

58:40.609 --> 58:44.221
Our last act tonight are a street
dance crew

58:44.223 --> 58:46.942
who have got the world at their feet.

58:46.943 --> 58:50.542
They're incredibly creative,
they're bursting with talent,

58:50.543 --> 58:53.982
and they've got youth on their side.
I'll be honest - they make me sick.

58:53.983 --> 58:55.983
It's DVJ.

58:57.943 --> 59:00.822
Hello.
This is it!

59:00.823 --> 59:03.222
Final rehearsals. Are you guys at
the studio yet?

59:03.223 --> 59:06.102
I'm so nervous. I can't believe this
is actually happening.

59:06.103 --> 59:09.582
Hold on, another call.
You guys had better be ready.

59:09.583 --> 59:11.622
We've got a semi-final to smash.

59:11.623 --> 59:13.623
Hurry up, slowcoaches.

59:14.783 --> 59:18.142
ALL: We are Diversity Juniors!

59:18.143 --> 59:20.143
(GIGGLES)

59:21.343 --> 59:24.222
So, the best thing about coming to
the studio

59:24.223 --> 59:27.342
is the opportunities I get,
the fun we have,

59:27.343 --> 59:29.662
and just the family vibe is just
amazing.

59:29.663 --> 59:32.342
(LAUGHS) What's up, guys?
What's up, what's up?

59:32.343 --> 59:37.302
Our teachers are Ashley, Nathan
and Perri.

59:37.303 --> 59:40.622
They're such good role models and
they're just genuinely nice people

59:40.623 --> 59:43.822
to be around. You can ask them
anything and they're just helpful.

59:43.823 --> 59:46.063
They just give you the confidence
you need.

59:49.263 --> 59:51.062
This is your opportunity to go out
there

59:51.063 --> 59:54.102
and show people why you guys deserve
to be DVJ

59:54.103 --> 59:55.582
and why you deserve this shot.

59:55.583 --> 59:58.222
It's nothing to do with me,
nothing to do with Diversity.

59:58.223 --> 01:00:00.502
This is all about you
and your moment.

01:00:00.503 --> 01:00:04.902
Tonight we're gonna go out there
and show everyone what we can do.

01:00:04.903 --> 01:00:07.743
And I'm gonna... slay!
(ALL LAUGH)

01:03:02.343 --> 01:03:04.343
Simon?

01:03:11.103 --> 01:03:13.142
Oh, wow, wow, wow, wow.

01:03:13.143 --> 01:03:15.143
(CHANTING AND CHEERING CONTINUES)

01:03:23.783 --> 01:03:28.222
OK, OK. So... so I erm,

01:03:28.223 --> 01:03:32.542
I saw Ashley erm,
who was in Diversity,

01:03:32.543 --> 01:03:35.022
four nights ago. And he said to me,

01:03:35.023 --> 01:03:38.902
"I've never been more nervous
than I am right now

01:03:38.903 --> 01:03:42.982
because this group are coming on the
show." That's how passionate he is.

01:03:42.983 --> 01:03:47.983
But - And this is 12, 14 years ago
I think he was on this show himself.

01:03:48.943 --> 01:03:52.342
But let's remember, even though it's
Diversity Juniors,

01:03:52.343 --> 01:03:56.702
it's actually you. You made this
special tonight. Every one of you.

01:03:56.703 --> 01:03:59.342
(CHEERING)
It was a show.

01:03:59.343 --> 01:04:02.222
It was absolutely fantastic.

01:04:02.223 --> 01:04:06.302
Your energy, your enthusiasm,
your choice of music, everything.

01:04:06.303 --> 01:04:08.942
And let's always remember,
it's called showbusiness.

01:04:08.943 --> 01:04:11.302
The most important part of that is
"show."

01:04:11.303 --> 01:04:13.342
And that's what you demonstrated
tonight.

01:04:13.343 --> 01:04:16.222
You put on a show. It was brilliant.

01:04:16.223 --> 01:04:18.382
(CHEERING)
Really impressed, guys.

01:04:18.383 --> 01:04:23.383
No comments are necessary.
It was perfection.

01:04:24.103 --> 01:04:26.103
(CHEERING)

01:04:28.823 --> 01:04:31.822
Before you guys came out on the
stage I was a little bit nervous.

01:04:31.823 --> 01:04:34.782
I wasn't sure which way the show was
going and oh, my goodness,

01:04:34.783 --> 01:04:36.942
you have just blown the roof off
this place.

01:04:36.943 --> 01:04:38.982
I love you so much.

01:04:38.983 --> 01:04:41.022
Can I just quickly say...

01:04:41.023 --> 01:04:45.582
round of applause for... that was
sensational.

01:04:45.583 --> 01:04:47.662
You are seriously talented dancers.

01:04:47.663 --> 01:04:50.782
I can't wait to see what's gonna
happen with your future. Brilliant.

01:04:50.783 --> 01:04:52.822
(CHEERING)

01:04:52.823 --> 01:04:56.502
I mean, you are the next generation.

01:04:56.503 --> 01:04:59.102
I know that we shouldn't,
but every single time

01:04:59.103 --> 01:05:02.182
a dance group comes onto this show
we wish it was Diversity.

01:05:02.183 --> 01:05:07.183
You are not Diversity.
You are... DVJ!

01:05:07.623 --> 01:05:09.662
(CHEERING)
Yeah, I got it!

01:05:09.663 --> 01:05:13.182
Actually, I was gonna say you're
better than Diversity.

01:05:13.183 --> 01:05:17.942
You're amazing. Guys, very quickly,
just want to hear from you.

01:05:17.943 --> 01:05:20.102
How did that feel?
That felt amazing.

01:05:20.103 --> 01:05:23.982
Can I just say, I wanna say thank
you to the judges and everyone

01:05:23.983 --> 01:05:27.742
because it is, like, our dream to be
here right now.

01:05:27.743 --> 01:05:32.142
And to get through to the final
would be amazing.

01:05:32.143 --> 01:05:34.782
Well, well done. You did brilliantly.

01:05:34.783 --> 01:05:37.662

through my eyes.
It wasn't funny at all.

In fact, I went blind.

01:07:35.423 --> 01:07:39.142

things, but only in Heinz sight.
