11:19.464 --> 11:22.299
Owen.

11:22.333 --> 11:25.235
Are these pins places you've been or...

11:25.270 --> 11:27.237
do I need to look closer?

11:29.107 --> 11:30.741
Owen: Here's where things get messy.

11:30.775 --> 11:33.577
Manipulating a cause and
time of death for a body

11:33.611 --> 11:38.015
is a worst-case scenario,
yet totally essential skill.

11:38.049 --> 11:40.317
It has to look real.

11:40.351 --> 11:43.887
Remember, practice makes perfect.

11:49.160 --> 11:52.529
Almost like you've done this before.

11:52.564 --> 11:55.132
Saw it in a movie.

11:55.166 --> 11:58.368
How'd you like to help me out
on a real off-book assignment?

11:58.403 --> 11:59.469
What's in it for me?

11:59.504 --> 12:01.171
I'm already keeping your secret.

12:01.206 --> 12:04.975
I thought this week's lesson
was illusion, not blackmail.

12:05.009 --> 12:08.812
Well, now you can learn one
of my secrets to make it even.

12:12.417 --> 12:15.185
Tonight, you'll take
part in a live operation

12:15.220 --> 12:17.387
that'll utilize the
skills you've learned.

12:17.422 --> 12:18.989
A journalist for the Post, Al Crawford,

12:19.023 --> 12:20.557
has spent the last two days

12:20.592 --> 12:23.293
holed up in a suite
at the Franklin Club,

12:23.328 --> 12:25.395
a members-only social club in D.C.

12:25.430 --> 12:27.141
The Agency believes
that he's been hiding out

12:27.165 --> 12:29.833
after facilitating a leak of
state secrets to the Russians.

12:29.867 --> 12:32.703
You are being enlisted
to survey Mr. Crawford

12:32.737 --> 12:35.339
and will be going in undercover
as prospective new members.

12:35.373 --> 12:37.808
You'll rub elbows with the D.C. elite...

12:37.842 --> 12:40.711
congressmen, ambassadors,
K Street lawyers,

12:40.745 --> 12:42.646
and a lot of rich old white men.

12:42.680 --> 12:44.391
Once Crawford leaves
his suite to have dinner

12:44.415 --> 12:46.183
in one of the dining
rooms on the premises,

12:46.217 --> 12:47.117
three of you...

12:47.151 --> 12:49.620
Three? Well, how about
me, Alex, and Ryan?

12:50.855 --> 12:51.622
Very well, Doyle.

12:51.656 --> 12:53.523
The three of you case said suite

12:53.558 --> 12:55.425
and give that intel to a clean-up team.

12:55.460 --> 12:57.694
Leigh, León, you run
point surveying Crawford,

12:57.729 --> 13:00.497
and keep Harry, Alex, and
Ryan posted on his moves.

13:00.531 --> 13:03.033
I thought the CIA doesn't
operate on American soil.

13:03.067 --> 13:04.401
The CIA isn't.

13:04.435 --> 13:07.070
Since you're not CIA, not yet anyway.

13:07.105 --> 13:08.916
All right, the Agency's
still waiting confirmation

13:08.940 --> 13:10.020
on Mr. Crawford's activity.

13:11.643 --> 13:13.243
This is real, people.

13:13.278 --> 13:15.178
And since this is real,

13:15.213 --> 13:17.748
say hello to your get
out of jail free pass.

13:17.782 --> 13:19.850
This is an endorsement card.

13:19.884 --> 13:22.085
Should you run afoul of
local law enforcement,

13:22.120 --> 13:23.520
given your illegal activity,

13:23.554 --> 13:25.756
you can use it to have
your slate wiped clean.

13:25.790 --> 13:29.259
However, if any of you do
so, don't bother coming back.

13:29.294 --> 13:30.927
I'll consider that your resignation.

13:30.962 --> 13:32.596
Come on up, get your data packs.

13:32.630 --> 13:35.399
Background on Crawford,
floor plans of the club,

13:35.433 --> 13:37.701
and your very own cover story.

13:38.803 --> 13:41.471
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey. Another threesome?

13:41.506 --> 13:44.574
How about it? But this time sober, huh?

13:44.609 --> 13:45.642
Yeah?

13:45.677 --> 13:47.444
[Chuckles]

13:57.255 --> 14:00.394
<i>This is Shelby. Leave a message.</i> [Beep]

14:00.692 --> 14:02.793
Will: Hey, it's Will. Can you meet?

14:02.827 --> 14:06.229
I <i>need</i> to see you.
It's about your agents.

14:06.264 --> 14:07.764
I'll text you an address.

14:07.799 --> 14:09.132
[Beep]

14:18.412 --> 14:19.753
Will: So, if what you're saying is true,

14:19.777 --> 14:23.180
then Miranda is guilty
of treason, espionage, conspiracy...

14:23.214 --> 14:25.182
half the statutes in the Patriot Act.

14:25.216 --> 14:27.684
Which is why I have to be sure.

14:27.719 --> 14:32.122
So, you're trusting the word
of Eric Boyer, a criminal,

14:32.156 --> 14:34.257
and you've known Miranda for years.

14:34.292 --> 14:37.861
She's a mentor and a friend.
I'm just stating the facts.

14:37.895 --> 14:38.965
Will.

14:38.990 --> 14:42.165
I want to be wrong about this. I do.

14:42.200 --> 14:44.134
Which is why I need you to tell me

14:44.168 --> 14:46.670
if Miranda is pulling the
wool over all of our eyes

14:46.704 --> 14:48.638
before I hand you over to her.

15:01.919 --> 15:04.121
[Beeping]

15:36.493 --> 15:37.733
[Night vision goggles whirring]

16:01.960 --> 16:04.200
Will, it's me again.

16:04.224 --> 16:05.841
Call me back.

16:06.053 --> 16:07.630
I just don't get it.

16:07.646 --> 16:10.959
Why would he call, text an
address, and then go silent?

16:10.984 --> 16:12.517
Do you think he's in danger?

16:12.551 --> 16:14.252
Do you think that Alex and Ryan are?

16:14.286 --> 16:15.787
- We need to call them.
- We can't.

16:15.821 --> 16:17.288
If they're compromised,

16:17.323 --> 16:20.191
any attempt at contacting
them will be intercepted

16:20.225 --> 16:21.626
and implicate them and us.

16:21.660 --> 16:24.996
Okay, but why Will? Why
would he be involved?

16:25.030 --> 16:26.431
How did he even know about us?

16:26.465 --> 16:27.498
[Sighs]

16:27.533 --> 16:30.268
He was at the CIA black
site for months last year.

16:30.302 --> 16:32.870
Who's to say that the AIC
weren't the ones holding him?

16:32.905 --> 16:35.506
What if Harry Doyle
and Leigh Davis are AIC?

16:35.541 --> 16:37.508
Who knows what they could've done.

16:37.543 --> 16:39.877
Right now, we only know
one thing for certain...

16:39.912 --> 16:41.379
The address that Will sent.

16:41.413 --> 16:42.880
It's the Franklin Club in D.C.

16:42.915 --> 16:44.015
We have to go there.

16:44.049 --> 16:46.384
Are you crazy? This can be a trap.

16:46.418 --> 16:48.486
Look, you can either
come with me and cover me

16:48.520 --> 16:49.787
or stay here, but I'm going.

16:53.158 --> 16:55.393
[Jazz music playing]

16:55.621 --> 16:56.728
Comms check.

16:56.762 --> 16:57.823
- Check.
- Check.

16:57.848 --> 16:59.330
- In position.
- In position.

16:59.365 --> 17:00.365
- Check.
- Check.

17:00.399 --> 17:03.568
- Velez, where are you?
- Haven't seen him, sir.

17:03.602 --> 17:05.703
Remember, everyone maintain cover.

17:05.738 --> 17:07.372
[Headsets beep]

17:07.406 --> 17:09.165
Someone could be watching us.

17:09.191 --> 17:11.709
Pretend I'm just a Supreme
Court clerk hitting on you.

17:11.743 --> 17:14.646
- Who do you want to be?
- I can't do this right now.

17:14.680 --> 17:15.980
Between Leigh and Harry,

17:16.015 --> 17:17.749
it's just getting harder to pretend.

17:17.782 --> 17:19.684
I don't know what lie I just told.

17:19.718 --> 17:21.551
I know what you mean.

17:21.587 --> 17:24.756
Maybe that's why this was never
meant to be a two-person mission.

17:24.790 --> 17:27.659
Do you think we'd do better
if it was just one of us here?

17:27.693 --> 17:29.360
Do you?

17:31.797 --> 17:33.531
[Headset beeps]

Uh, I'm... I'm sorry. I have to get...

19:00.452 --> 19:03.087
Wait. Uh, I'm sorry.

19:03.122 --> 19:05.523
It's just I'm... I'm
hiding from someone.

19:06.147 --> 19:07.258
Who?

19:07.292 --> 19:09.654
Well, I can't tell you that.

19:12.389 --> 19:15.260
- What are you doing here?
- I'm a member.

19:15.285 --> 19:16.731
Really? So am I.

19:16.756 --> 19:18.723
Or... prospective.

19:19.356 --> 19:22.925
Listen, something tells me seeing
you twice in one day is a sign.

19:22.950 --> 19:24.684
Maybe we can make it three?

19:24.719 --> 19:26.920
Tonight? Bochco's Diner?

[Cellphone vibrating]

19:33.155 --> 19:34.222
Hello?

19:34.247 --> 19:36.686
Hey, I just got Shelby's
voicemail saying to call you.

19:36.733 --> 19:38.567
My phone's been acting up all day.

19:38.601 --> 19:41.837
Well, it's that or the guy I'm
seeing is playing a trick on me.

19:41.871 --> 19:44.740
Is he tall, dark hair, Hispanic?

19:44.774 --> 19:47.876
No, Julian's British,
if that's even his name.

19:49.679 --> 19:52.247
Pale, blue eyes, ears?

19:52.282 --> 19:54.291
- Wait, how'd you know?
- I have to go.

19:54.403 --> 19:57.038
- Thank you for your help.
- Wait, Nimah.

20:03.943 --> 20:06.692
- I think we should...
- Aha, just the people I was looking for.

20:06.717 --> 20:10.065
There's someone I'd like you to meet.
It's a mystery guest. Come with me.

20:10.099 --> 20:15.404
Ladies and gentlemen, let me introduce
you to your handler, Shelby...

20:15.438 --> 20:17.272
Hi.

20:17.307 --> 20:19.541
Sorry about that, love.

20:20.700 --> 20:23.401
You thought that was
Shelby Wyatt, didn't you?

20:23.456 --> 20:25.790
Are you trying to set us up, Harry?

20:26.173 --> 20:28.708
How many times do I have to
tell you we're not FBI anymore?

20:29.968 --> 20:32.589
Leigh: Ryan, Alex, Harry.
Crawford's on the move.

You're a go.

be CIA, then, shall we?

20:52.075 --> 20:53.242
Hello, Owen.

20:53.276 --> 20:55.143
I just called 911.

20:55.178 --> 20:58.121
Local police response
time is 13 minutes.

20:58.146 --> 21:00.782
I suppose you can leave
now and avoid surveillance,

21:00.817 --> 21:03.118
but what will you do
with what you left behind?

21:03.152 --> 21:04.753
Well, you've taught us well.

21:04.787 --> 21:06.755
We haven't left any traces of ourselves.

21:06.789 --> 21:08.924
Maybe tonight, but not today.

21:08.958 --> 21:11.493
You all touched a lot
of things at The Farm.

21:11.527 --> 21:14.106
I brought some of it along and
sprinkled them throughout the room.

21:14.130 --> 21:16.431
Ryan's saliva, Harry's prints.

21:16.466 --> 21:18.967
Hell, the room is
under your alias, Alex.

21:19.002 --> 21:21.803
Either clean it up
in the next 12 minutes

21:21.838 --> 21:24.640
or use your endorsement
card and go home.

21:24.674 --> 21:26.124
Bye now.

21:52.264 --> 21:54.199
Man: Freeze!

gonna check out my suite.

22:03.775 --> 22:05.309
See if I've got a king-sized bed,

22:05.343 --> 22:07.154
maybe get a couple Senate
pages up from downstairs

22:07.178 --> 22:09.112
to Netflix and chill with.

22:09.147 --> 22:10.414
Wait, you're leaving?

22:10.448 --> 22:12.716
Your ass is on the line, too.

22:12.750 --> 22:14.218
What the hell is that?

22:14.252 --> 22:16.263
Yep, looks like I haven't
touched anything but these.

22:16.287 --> 22:18.121
I avoided surveillance on the way up.

22:18.156 --> 22:20.791
It's not my room, not my
problem, so I was never here.

22:20.825 --> 22:22.208
- See ya.
- Hey, wait.

22:23.294 --> 22:26.763
We're a team, remember?
You volunteered us for that.

22:26.798 --> 22:29.166
Alex: Let him go, Ryan. In
fact, you should go, too.

22:29.200 --> 22:32.302
I can explain away your DNA,
but this is my mess to clean.

22:32.337 --> 22:33.737
The room is under my alias.

22:33.771 --> 22:36.340
You can't lift that body by
yourself. Neither could I.

22:36.374 --> 22:38.108
I can use the endorsement card.

22:38.142 --> 22:40.110
At least that way you'll
still be at The Farm.

22:40.144 --> 22:42.079
Okay, this melodramatic
little martyr thing

22:42.113 --> 22:44.147
might turn you two on, but
it's boring me to tears.

22:44.182 --> 22:45.182
May I go?

22:45.216 --> 22:46.922
If it was you, what would you do?

22:46.947 --> 22:49.157
Well, I could solve
this mess in one move.

22:51.222 --> 22:53.924
Well, I'll tell you if you tell
me everything I want to know.

22:53.958 --> 22:55.425
- Deal.
- Alex.

22:55.460 --> 22:58.120
- We need this.
- Yeah, we do.

22:58.136 --> 23:01.172
You have 10 minutes
and 58 seconds. Spill.

23:01.197 --> 23:03.065
Okay, replace glasses, knives, forks,

23:03.099 --> 23:05.567
sheets, towels with
anything from your room.

23:05.601 --> 23:08.155
Turn the room into someone
else's name. Problem solved.

23:08.180 --> 23:09.771
But who?

23:09.806 --> 23:11.306
- Owen.
- Good.

23:11.340 --> 23:12.874
We can beat him at his own game.

23:12.909 --> 23:15.087
In order to get him a member suite
for the night, we need his credit card,

23:15.111 --> 23:16.422
his driver's license
to put it in the system.

23:16.446 --> 23:17.556
Yeah, well, he keeps his wallet

23:17.580 --> 23:20.148
in his jacket left-hand side
pocket just like you, Booth.

23:20.183 --> 23:21.917
Look, if you admit you're FBI,

23:21.951 --> 23:24.319
I will personally go
and get it for you myself

while you clean up this mess.

23:26.556 --> 23:29.324
Tick, tock, tick.

23:31.160 --> 23:33.095
I'm FBI. She's not.

23:33.129 --> 23:34.784
We'll explain everything
when this is done.

23:34.808 --> 23:36.843
- For now, let's go.
- All right.

23:36.878 --> 23:38.791
Back in a jiffy.

23:39.942 --> 23:41.845
Let's do this.

23:43.206 --> 23:44.306
So, wait a minute.

23:44.340 --> 23:46.708
You're saying you run this
sort of thing every year?

23:46.743 --> 23:48.844
Have an old friend
pretend to be a criminal

23:48.878 --> 23:50.846
and then park a dead body in their suite

23:50.880 --> 23:52.013
to freak out recruits?

23:52.048 --> 23:53.315
Something like that.

23:53.349 --> 23:55.450
- [Laughs]

Or are you CIA like Lydia?

36:43.017 --> 36:44.760
No, but seriously, what is that term?

36:44.784 --> 36:46.306
Because it is right here
on the tip of my tongue.

36:46.330 --> 36:49.375
- You MI6?
- Transparency.

36:49.734 --> 36:52.457
Transparency. That's what
it is. It's so American.

36:52.492 --> 36:55.726
It's like "above board"
and "jean jacket."

36:55.797 --> 36:57.597
And yes, Ryan, I'm with MI6.

36:57.632 --> 37:00.367
Wow. Took you long enough.

37:00.401 --> 37:02.793
- Does anybody else know?
- Uh, yeah. Only everybody.

37:02.818 --> 37:06.173
Owen, Lydia, the
instructors, all of the CIA.

37:06.207 --> 37:08.552
Basically everyone apart from
you two and the other recruits.

37:08.576 --> 37:11.378
But I don't understand. So
you're an undercover agent?

37:11.412 --> 37:14.234
No, that's you. Do
you mind if I eat these?

37:14.259 --> 37:16.219
Everyone knows I'm there
because it's above board.

37:16.250 --> 37:19.219
It's above board. There
you go. I just got that.

37:19.253 --> 37:20.454
[Chuckles]

37:20.488 --> 37:23.023
Anyway, I'm part of a pilot program

37:23.048 --> 37:25.258
where one of me comes
and trains with the CIA,

37:25.293 --> 37:26.704
one of them goes and trains in London.

37:26.728 --> 37:28.405
It's kind of like a foreign
exchange, if you will.

37:28.429 --> 37:29.596
You're an agent?

37:29.630 --> 37:32.099
Yeah, I'm in the Foreign Office, Ryan,

37:32.133 --> 37:34.634
in Her Majesty's
service, Officer Rank Two.

37:34.669 --> 37:37.270
And before you ask, yes, I can prove it.

37:37.305 --> 37:40.240
But I'm not going to just yet
because I've shown you mine,

37:40.274 --> 37:41.952
and I think it's time
that you show me yours.

37:41.976 --> 37:43.344
Hmm?

37:43.369 --> 37:47.247
I'm pretty sure there isn't a pilot
program for the CIA and the FBI.

37:47.281 --> 37:48.540
So, what's what?

37:48.565 --> 37:50.828
Now look, I swear to God you better
come clean, 'cause if you don't,

37:50.852 --> 37:55.119
I will use all the resources of the
U.K. and America to find out for myself.

37:55.455 --> 37:57.491
We're CIA recruits, Harry.

37:57.525 --> 38:00.394
We were handpicked and
recruited just like...

38:00.428 --> 38:03.668
Shut up. Okay? Just
shut up. It's enough now.

38:03.693 --> 38:07.834
I know Shelby Wyatt and, as of
today, Nimah Amin are active agents,

38:07.869 --> 38:10.248
and you two are clearly
working with them.

38:10.553 --> 38:11.905
Right?

38:13.185 --> 38:15.543
No? No response? Poker face? Okay.

38:15.568 --> 38:17.611
Well, my next appointment
call is Owen. Thank you.

38:17.645 --> 38:20.388
All right, stop. Wait. Wait.

38:23.451 --> 38:25.118
We're CIA.

38:25.857 --> 38:27.693
And we're FBI.

38:28.162 --> 38:31.291
And we can explain more, but we do need
to speak to our supervisors about it.

38:31.325 --> 38:33.527
I'm pretty sure as MI6,
you understand that.

38:33.561 --> 38:35.796
So, please don't speak to anyone...

38:35.830 --> 38:39.533
not Owen, not the other recruits,
and especially not Leigh.

38:39.567 --> 38:41.435
We think she might be
working for someone.

38:41.469 --> 38:43.336
She may have bugged Alex's room.

38:43.371 --> 38:45.172
We found this the other night.

38:45.206 --> 38:46.506
That.

38:46.541 --> 38:48.572
No, no. That was me.

38:48.597 --> 38:50.829
Sorry, I was trying to
figure out who you were.

38:50.854 --> 38:53.547
Did you find the other one
I put in your room, as well?

38:53.581 --> 38:56.950
No? That's a shame.

38:57.651 --> 39:01.181
Get your phones, call your supervisors,

39:01.206 --> 39:03.198
and verify my story.

39:03.419 --> 39:05.735
Because I swear to God no
one is going back to The Farm

39:05.760 --> 39:11.131
until we have complete transparency.

39:13.534 --> 39:15.101
Cheers.

39:19.979 --> 39:23.910
Hey! How was your day? What did you see?

39:23.945 --> 39:26.313
Boy: Hi, Mommy. Where are you?

39:26.347 --> 39:29.316
I'm visiting Grandma for a while.

39:29.350 --> 39:30.484
I told you.

39:30.518 --> 39:33.183
Where's Grandma? Can I say hi?
