WEBVTT

00:12.011 --> 00:14.472
[D13 coughing]

00:16.224 --> 00:17.642
Where's the quantum frame?

00:22.147 --> 00:23.440
He asked you a question.

00:24.232 --> 00:25.233
[Carly cocks pistol]

00:25.316 --> 00:27.694
Do it. It's what I want anyway.

00:27.777 --> 00:30.613
You've been doing what we want
for months. Why stop now?

00:30.697 --> 00:32.574
How many members
of the Faction are here?

00:34.492 --> 00:35.910
It could be anybody we meet.

00:35.994 --> 00:38.371
And there could be thousands more
in the quantum frame.

00:38.455 --> 00:40.790
That's why the Director wanted us
to destroy it.

00:40.874 --> 00:43.418
[Jenny] The Director ordered you
to build the thing.

00:43.501 --> 00:45.503
How can you people
not see the irony of that?

00:45.587 --> 00:48.673
Y-you just follow it blindly
no matter what.

00:48.757 --> 00:50.175
That's the difference between us.

00:50.258 --> 00:53.261
No, the Faction abducts innocent people
and overwrites them.

00:53.344 --> 00:54.804
That's the difference between us.

00:54.888 --> 00:56.306
What you do is murder.

00:56.389 --> 00:58.224
What you do is opportunism,

00:58.308 --> 01:00.810
like taking hosts just before they die
is so fucking ethical?

01:00.894 --> 01:02.896
Yeah, that's exactly what it is.

01:02.979 --> 01:04.022
[Jenny scoffs] Guess what.

01:04.105 --> 01:05.732
Everybody is going to die,

01:05.815 --> 01:07.692
some sooner than others.

01:08.693 --> 01:11.529
Where we're from, everybody
in the 21st is long gone.

01:11.613 --> 01:14.240
And for what they did to this planet,
good riddance.

01:14.324 --> 01:16.367
Here's what's gonna happen, Jenny.

01:16.451 --> 01:17.869
We're gonna stop this pandemic,

01:17.952 --> 01:21.831
and then we are gonna hunt down
every member of the Faction in the 21st.

01:21.915 --> 01:24.125
The Director is shut down
in the future,

01:24.209 --> 01:26.628
and most of your team will be dead
in less than two weeks,

01:26.711 --> 01:28.004
so, good luck.

01:49.901 --> 01:51.111
If you're done questioning her,

01:51.194 --> 01:53.404
I'd like to take a few tissue samples,
run some tests.

01:53.488 --> 01:55.281
Please. Whatever you need to do.

01:56.950 --> 01:58.451
[Trevor coughs]

01:58.535 --> 02:00.745
We should send out an SOS
on the deep web

02:00.829 --> 02:03.456
and let other travelers know
what's going on.

02:03.540 --> 02:05.542
They'll be monitoring our back channels.

02:05.625 --> 02:08.044
If the Faction's overwritten
every single federal agent

02:08.128 --> 02:09.963
that was in that room
with the quantum frame,

02:10.046 --> 02:12.090
I don't have those assets to use either.

02:12.173 --> 02:13.842
Okay, this is not that complicated.

02:13.925 --> 02:14.843
[Trevor scoffs]

02:14.926 --> 02:17.470
I'm saying the Director can fix this.

02:17.554 --> 02:20.098
We need to fix the Director.

02:20.181 --> 02:22.225
The Director exists in the future.

02:22.308 --> 02:24.394
And its reactor's already shut down.

02:24.477 --> 02:25.895
Those are big problems, Grace.

02:25.979 --> 02:27.397
The plan's already in place.

02:27.480 --> 02:29.482
When it became apparent
that the grand plan

02:29.566 --> 02:31.568
would take longer
than our initial projections,

02:31.651 --> 02:33.862
the Director sent a team to refine uranium

02:33.945 --> 02:36.239
as fuel to extend its operational life.

02:36.322 --> 02:38.533
A few kilos would be enough.

02:38.616 --> 02:42.036
All we have to do
is take the fuel to the location

02:42.120 --> 02:43.955
where the Director
will eventually be built,

02:44.038 --> 02:45.665
and it'll be there when the time comes.

02:45.748 --> 02:46.958
Without the Faction knowing.

02:47.041 --> 02:48.459
How the hell are we gonna do that?

02:48.543 --> 02:51.504
Oh, they outsmarted us!
Whoop-dee-doo! Get over it!

02:51.588 --> 02:53.756
They can't outsmart the Director.

02:53.840 --> 02:56.050
Even if we can just get it
back online for a few seconds,

02:56.134 --> 02:58.511
that's all the time it'll need
to take back control.

02:58.595 --> 03:00.597
And you know where this uranium is?

03:00.680 --> 03:01.806
Pull up a map.

03:03.433 --> 03:05.643
[Geiger counter clicking]

03:08.730 --> 03:10.857
[clicking continues]

03:58.238 --> 04:00.406
[groans] It's hot in there.

04:01.407 --> 04:03.785
Ever think you'd hear yourself complain
about the heat?

04:03.868 --> 04:04.744
[chuckles] No.

04:05.328 --> 04:06.537
Radiation, maybe.

04:07.664 --> 04:09.457
You really want to lose another game?

04:09.540 --> 04:11.793
[knock on door]

04:14.462 --> 04:15.755
Who the hell is that?

04:17.674 --> 04:19.509
[knock on door]

04:32.105 --> 04:34.190
[high-pitched buzz]

04:35.900 --> 04:36.734
Who are you?

04:36.818 --> 04:38.236
I'm 4112.

04:38.319 --> 04:39.529
What are you doing here?

04:39.612 --> 04:42.240
I just received orders to provide
backup at this location.

04:43.574 --> 04:44.909
You can lower your gun.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.122
Backup for what?

04:49.205 --> 04:51.457
Damn, I was kind of hoping
you could tell me.

04:51.541 --> 04:53.209
I'm-- I'm sorry, guys, squeaky little kid

04:53.293 --> 04:55.503
took me by surprise
when she first started talking.

04:55.586 --> 04:58.298
-I missed the whole first part.
-Yeah. Messengers are weird.

04:58.381 --> 05:01.175
Yeah, she said something
about uranium, maybe?

05:01.259 --> 05:02.677
Yeah, you heard right.

05:02.760 --> 05:05.555
We're refining it.
It's fuel for the Director.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.349
[Forbes] How the hell do you get it
to the future?

05:08.433 --> 05:09.434
We don't.

05:09.517 --> 05:12.937
Make it in the 21st, put it away for the
Director to find in a few hundred years.

05:13.021 --> 05:15.523
We're right on schedule, so I don't
know what we need backup for.

05:15.606 --> 05:16.816
Yeah.

05:16.899 --> 05:18.484
[silenced gunshots]

05:19.944 --> 05:21.571
How much have you produced?

05:21.654 --> 05:23.990
[stammers] 2.4 kilos.

05:24.073 --> 05:25.283
Why-- why did you do that?

05:25.366 --> 05:26.367
Show me where.

05:27.452 --> 05:28.286
Thank you.

05:31.956 --> 05:33.166
We're clear.

05:35.960 --> 05:37.795
[door buzzes]

05:37.879 --> 05:40.256
[distant door opens]

05:40.339 --> 05:41.549
It's in there.

05:44.343 --> 05:45.178
Take it all.

05:47.889 --> 05:49.891
-[Jeffrey Jr. crying]
-[Jeff coughing]

05:49.974 --> 05:51.392
It's okay, it's okay.

05:51.476 --> 05:52.477
Shh.

05:52.560 --> 05:53.978
[cell phone rings]

05:54.062 --> 05:55.063
[Jeff] It's okay.

05:55.146 --> 05:56.147
[cell phone rings]

05:56.230 --> 05:57.815
[crying continues]

05:57.899 --> 05:58.900
Ahh.

05:58.983 --> 06:00.068
Hello?

06:00.151 --> 06:01.360
Hey, Sarge.

06:03.362 --> 06:05.782
Yeah, no, I'm sorry,
my son is sick and I had to, uh...

06:06.616 --> 06:07.784
Yeah, no, no, I understand.

06:08.785 --> 06:11.329
Yeah, I'll come down as soon
as his mom gets home.

06:12.455 --> 06:13.623
Okay, thanks, Sarge.

06:14.916 --> 06:15.917
[Jeff coughing]

06:16.000 --> 06:18.002
Yeah, that's it.

06:18.836 --> 06:20.838
[woman]  ...yet-to-be-named virus.

06:20.922 --> 06:23.716
It has infected thousands of people
around the world,

06:23.800 --> 06:27.011
with the highest infection rates
among the most vulnerable:

06:27.095 --> 06:29.138
pregnant women, children,
the elderly

06:29.222 --> 06:31.432
and those with lowered immune systems.

06:31.516 --> 06:35.144
Many are turning to emergency rooms
in hopes of treatment,

06:35.228 --> 06:37.438
but infection rates are on the rise,

06:37.522 --> 06:41.192
with nearly every hospital bed
in the city now occupied.

06:41.275 --> 06:43.986
The mayor is expected to make
a statement shortly.

06:44.070 --> 06:47.281
-However, the epidemic has authorities
-[coughs]

06:47.365 --> 06:50.368
suggesting that everyone stay
in their homes.

07:00.461 --> 07:02.088
[handcuffs lock]

07:03.256 --> 07:04.966
What did he do to me?

07:05.049 --> 07:06.801
Just took some blood
and tissue samples.

07:07.844 --> 07:09.262
You're still intact.

07:12.849 --> 07:14.267
You understand, don't you?

07:16.436 --> 07:18.813
No. You used me.

07:18.896 --> 07:19.730
Philip.

07:19.814 --> 07:22.400
Come on, I was on a mission,
just like you.

07:22.483 --> 07:25.903
We want the same thing.
We just go about it a different way.

07:26.904 --> 07:30.533
We forget about the protocols
and the Director

07:30.616 --> 07:33.369
and all of those limitations,
and we just...

07:33.453 --> 07:35.705
do what needs to be done,
and what's right.

07:36.289 --> 07:38.791
Like Calloway and Aleksander.

07:38.875 --> 07:41.669
That's very different than murdering
almost a third of the population.

07:41.752 --> 07:43.796
To save everyone else.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.673
Not a bargain I can make.

07:46.257 --> 07:47.717
[Jenny] Well, it's done.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.677
There's no going back now.

07:49.760 --> 07:51.262
We're not giving up just yet.

07:51.846 --> 07:52.889
You should.

07:52.972 --> 07:55.183
Your people won't be able to stop this,

07:55.266 --> 07:57.185
and there's nothing a historian can do.

07:58.686 --> 08:01.105
Just... think about the time
you've got left.

08:02.315 --> 08:03.733
Let's get out of here.

08:03.816 --> 08:06.360
When I found you,
you had swallowed a bottle of pills.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.779
Why?

08:08.863 --> 08:09.697
Guilt?

08:10.907 --> 08:13.159
I feel no guilt at all.

08:13.242 --> 08:16.204
This is for the greater good,
and I can't believe you don't see that.

08:17.914 --> 08:18.915
Then why the pills?

08:18.998 --> 08:22.043
Because I was trying to end it
before the virus ran its course.

08:22.126 --> 08:23.503
You feel sick now...

08:23.586 --> 08:25.254
it's only gonna get worse.

08:25.338 --> 08:28.925
This virus is designed to keep
the infected alive as long as possible,

08:29.008 --> 08:30.176
to help the spread

08:30.259 --> 08:34.347
and make the authorities think
that it's not as serious as it really is.

08:34.430 --> 08:37.058
So, when people start to really die,
it's too late.

08:38.726 --> 08:41.979
And the last days of it are not
something I want to go through.

08:49.362 --> 08:50.655
Well, now you're going to suffer.

08:52.949 --> 08:54.450
Along with everyone else.

08:55.201 --> 08:56.786
For every last minute.

09:03.834 --> 09:04.835
[Jenny sighs]

09:14.554 --> 09:16.180
They're keeping it pretty low profile.

09:16.264 --> 09:17.890
[MacLaren] Think that's the idea.

09:19.934 --> 09:20.768
Okay.

09:21.352 --> 09:23.104
Watch our six
and listen in on comm.

09:23.187 --> 09:24.188
Copy that.

09:35.408 --> 09:36.409
Who is it?

09:36.492 --> 09:39.912
3468, on a Protocol Alpha mission.

09:41.080 --> 09:43.291
[beeping]

09:45.668 --> 09:47.295
3224. What's going on?

09:47.378 --> 09:49.839
[Carly]  We need to pull up a delivery.
It's urgent.

09:49.922 --> 09:51.048
[man]  Is this a joke?

09:51.132 --> 09:52.758
No.

09:52.842 --> 09:55.052
The reactor won't need more fuel
for hundreds of years.

09:55.136 --> 09:56.929
It's the here and now we're worried about.

09:57.013 --> 09:59.432
This flu that's going around is about
to become a pandemic.

09:59.515 --> 10:02.184
-And what's that got to do with us?
-Let's talk inside, shall we?

10:10.943 --> 10:13.696
[man]  All we have is
in the lab down the hall.

10:13.779 --> 10:16.991
But I still don't see what refined
uranium has to do with a pandemic.

10:17.074 --> 10:19.243
[Trevor] This guy picked the wrong
traveler number.

10:19.327 --> 10:21.329
3224 died six months ago.

10:21.412 --> 10:23.039
These guys are all Faction.

10:23.748 --> 10:25.583
Well, I wish I could tell you
the whole plan,

10:25.666 --> 10:27.501
but, you know, protocol two.

10:27.585 --> 10:30.004
No. I don't know.

10:31.380 --> 10:32.882
I'm gonna need more.

10:32.965 --> 10:35.926
Like what, something in writing?
The Director isn't good enough for you?

10:36.010 --> 10:37.970
You could be pretending
to be somebody else.

10:38.054 --> 10:41.390
I am pretending to be somebody else.
It's in the job description. You new here?

10:41.474 --> 10:44.769
No. I just don't want to see
uranium fall into the wrong hands.

10:44.852 --> 10:46.395
Well, neither do we.

10:48.064 --> 10:49.148
Hands on your head.

10:53.986 --> 10:54.820
[pistol clatters]

Door.

10:57.782 --> 10:58.616
[beep]

10:58.699 --> 10:59.742
[Trevor grunts]

11:03.079 --> 11:03.913
Show 'em where it is.

11:03.996 --> 11:06.457
Long gone. Have a look for yourself.

11:07.041 --> 11:07.875
Trev.

11:13.089 --> 11:15.675
Any of your team
showing any symptoms yet?

11:16.550 --> 11:18.886
-You look like you're in the early stages.
-Where did you take it?

11:18.969 --> 11:22.723
Even if I told you, the others would know,
and they'd just move it to a safe place.

11:22.807 --> 11:25.685
Some of them are on their way here now.
You're more than welcome to wait.

11:25.768 --> 11:28.229
No sign of uranium in the lab!

11:33.734 --> 11:35.861
-Shit!
-Feel better?

11:35.945 --> 11:38.114
-No.
-I do.

11:38.197 --> 11:39.198
Come on.

11:48.916 --> 11:50.543
This been tested?

11:50.626 --> 11:52.461
[David] Soup's safe, Bob, I promise.

11:52.545 --> 11:53.754
How'd you know my name?

11:53.838 --> 11:56.632
Why does no one ever recognize me
with this thing on?

11:56.715 --> 11:57.716
It's me.

11:57.800 --> 12:00.386
David! You shouldn't be here.

12:00.469 --> 12:02.763
Well, where else would I be?
All my friends are here.

12:02.847 --> 12:06.016
[Bob coughing]

12:06.100 --> 12:07.101
Soup's delicious.

12:07.184 --> 12:08.686
I tested it myself.

12:08.769 --> 12:11.063
Make you strong to fight
that bug that's going around.

12:13.482 --> 12:15.818
[Bob coughs]

12:17.945 --> 12:20.072
[D13 coughs]

12:20.156 --> 12:21.782
I've got to get back to my team.

12:21.866 --> 12:23.659
I've done all I can for Boyd.

12:25.161 --> 12:26.370
I wanted to give you these.

12:26.454 --> 12:28.873
They're not programmed
to affect the viral load,

12:28.956 --> 12:31.041
but if she starts to go
into organ failure,

12:31.125 --> 12:32.960
they might buy you some time.

12:33.043 --> 12:35.671
-[Marcy] Thank you.
-Aren't nanites by directive only?

12:35.754 --> 12:39.592
Well, with the Director down,
I figure the discretion falls on me.

12:39.675 --> 12:41.552
Boyd's a good medic.
We could use her.

12:42.386 --> 12:43.596
We'll do what we can.

12:43.679 --> 12:44.930
[D13] Good luck.

12:46.974 --> 12:50.186
I'd be willing to trade information
in exchange for those nanites.

12:50.269 --> 12:52.104
I thought you wanted to die.

12:52.188 --> 12:55.107
Not if the cure's right in front of me.
I'm not stupid.

12:55.191 --> 12:57.276
You're the control.
You get nothing.

12:58.569 --> 13:00.488
-Well?
-[Trevor] There's no uranium.

13:00.571 --> 13:03.157
Just the Faction, waiting for us.

13:04.408 --> 13:05.910
Why are you looking at me like that?

13:05.993 --> 13:07.411
You were the one that sent us there.

13:07.495 --> 13:09.705
Ohh, that is so insulting.

13:09.788 --> 13:14.543
Yes, I did, because we absolutely need it,
and time is short.

13:14.627 --> 13:16.378
Need to find out where it is
and go get it.

13:16.462 --> 13:19.006
They're a step ahead of us, at least.
We need another option.

13:19.089 --> 13:22.051
There aren't any other options.
We need to get the Director back online.

13:22.134 --> 13:25.179
The Faction has been
planning this for a long time.

13:25.262 --> 13:26.722
So, we gotta think outside the box.

13:26.806 --> 13:30.768
There's a military base just north
of here. NS Wallace.

13:30.851 --> 13:32.728
You're thinking nuclear weapons?

13:32.811 --> 13:34.939
That's nowhere near the box, Philip.

13:35.022 --> 13:37.149
But that's ideal from a field perspective.

13:37.233 --> 13:40.736
A few hundred years is nothing compared
to the half life of plutonium.

13:40.819 --> 13:43.072
-It would be difficult.
-Closer to impossible.

13:43.155 --> 13:45.783
And if we've thought about it,
then the Faction probably has too.

13:47.910 --> 13:51.455
[Marcy] Well, doesn't sound like
we have much of a choice.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.794
[indistinct TV news broadcast]

13:56.877 --> 14:00.005
I got you some groceries so you won't
have to go out for the next few days.

14:00.756 --> 14:02.925
Store was a madhouse.

14:03.008 --> 14:05.719
[Kat] I heard there's looting going on.

14:05.803 --> 14:07.346
Yeah, a few assholes.

14:08.264 --> 14:09.431
How are you feeling?

14:09.515 --> 14:11.141
I'm okay.

14:11.225 --> 14:13.352
Hot. Headache.

14:14.395 --> 14:16.230
Temperature's up near a hundred.

14:16.313 --> 14:17.773
Let's cool you down.

14:21.068 --> 14:24.780
The news said this was an epidemic.
Is it really that bad?

14:24.864 --> 14:28.826
Hopefully that's a...
bit of an overreaction.

14:29.910 --> 14:31.287
What is it?

14:31.370 --> 14:33.622
I'm not sure yet.
I'm working on it.

14:33.706 --> 14:38.043
But you are sick and you need to rest.

14:38.127 --> 14:41.547
[man]  So much so that while many
of the symptoms match the common flu,

14:41.630 --> 14:43.591
-it can't be classified...
- What do you know?

14:45.050 --> 14:46.385
How sick am I?

14:46.468 --> 14:47.761
[MacLaren sighs]

14:48.762 --> 14:49.597
Grant?

14:51.724 --> 14:53.058
I don't know.

14:53.642 --> 14:55.436
Okay, what do we do?

14:55.519 --> 14:57.313
The safest place for you is right here.

14:57.396 --> 15:00.149
Safest? Okay, now you're
starting to scare me.

15:00.232 --> 15:04.111
-Maybe we should go to the hospital.
-Not where you want to be right now.

15:05.279 --> 15:06.113
Look.

15:07.323 --> 15:09.700
Next couple days, it's gonna be
hard for me to get home.

15:09.783 --> 15:11.619
-Couple of days?
-I will try to--

15:11.702 --> 15:13.913
What about you?
You're gonna be exposed.

15:13.996 --> 15:17.249
I have got to support the people
who are trying to solve this.

15:17.333 --> 15:20.169
And you gotta take your meds and rest...

15:20.669 --> 15:22.463
and give your body

15:22.546 --> 15:26.467
and that baby
the fuel that they need, okay?

15:26.550 --> 15:28.928
That means fresh fruit,
not salted meat.

15:29.011 --> 15:30.429
[chuckles]

15:35.392 --> 15:36.894
Do you have to go so soon?

15:36.977 --> 15:38.979
The sooner I go,
the sooner I come back.

15:42.942 --> 15:43.776
I love you.

15:52.868 --> 15:54.078
So?

15:54.161 --> 15:55.704
Took all night, but they're done.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.790
Good work.
How's everybody holding up?

15:58.290 --> 15:59.500
We can nap in the car.

15:59.583 --> 16:02.169
When I left, you were afraid the device
wouldn't have enough range.

16:02.252 --> 16:03.629
Yeah, we fixed that.

16:03.712 --> 16:05.214
And how does it know when to activate?

16:05.297 --> 16:08.676
Well, the Director is programmed
to broadcast an emergency signal

16:08.759 --> 16:10.052
if it's ever powered down.

16:10.135 --> 16:12.805
Which should trigger the device
and activate it.

16:12.888 --> 16:13.764
Should?

16:13.847 --> 16:16.600
Want me to go over a list of things
that could go wrong with this plan?

16:16.684 --> 16:18.268
No, thank you.

16:18.352 --> 16:20.646
-It'll work, boss.
-[Carly] We're good to go.

16:20.729 --> 16:23.565
-All right then, let's gear up.
-[Trevor] Road trip!

16:25.150 --> 16:25.985
How is she?

16:26.986 --> 16:31.198
[sighs] Her viral load's holding steady,
but she's not getting any better.

16:31.281 --> 16:34.410
-The nanites will help, right?
-Could help.

16:34.493 --> 16:37.579
Could make things worse.
The Faction planned this well.

16:37.663 --> 16:40.165
It's hard to know what contingencies
they've thought of.

16:41.250 --> 16:43.669
Use Grace as you see fit,
but keep your eye on her.

16:45.462 --> 16:46.672
And take care.

16:48.215 --> 16:49.216
You too.

16:51.677 --> 16:53.595
[men and women coughing]

16:53.679 --> 16:55.472
[sirens wailing in distance]

16:57.766 --> 17:00.477
Hey, Bob, I brought you some soup.

17:02.271 --> 17:05.274
Bob? Bob?

17:06.150 --> 17:07.151
Bob?

17:08.485 --> 17:09.486
Oh, no.

17:14.450 --> 17:16.577
[Jeffrey Jr. crying]

17:17.202 --> 17:18.787
[voicemail beeps]

17:18.871 --> 17:19.997
Hey, Carly, it's me.

17:20.080 --> 17:22.332
I'm getting worried about you.

17:22.416 --> 17:25.878
About Jeffrey. [coughs]

17:25.961 --> 17:28.380
Listen, I'm sick as shit. Please, call me.

17:28.464 --> 17:30.716
Let me know where you are,
that you're okay.

17:30.799 --> 17:33.677
[sighs] Your son says hi, too.

17:35.262 --> 17:36.513
[Jeffrey Jr. crying]

17:45.689 --> 17:50.527
[Jenny coughing]

17:50.611 --> 17:52.905
[Jenny sighs] You're a hypocrite.

17:53.906 --> 17:57.701
You're all high and mighty about
sacrificing lives to save the future,

17:57.785 --> 18:00.537
and then you treat me like a lab rat.

18:00.621 --> 18:02.539
You did this to yourself.

18:02.623 --> 18:04.083
[Jenny coughs]

18:05.167 --> 18:06.460
This is a waste of resources.

18:06.543 --> 18:08.754
I should be programming the nanites.

18:08.837 --> 18:10.297
-Not yet.
-Why not?

18:10.380 --> 18:12.674
Because I want to see
if the anti-serum will work first.

18:12.758 --> 18:13.592
I'm close.

18:13.675 --> 18:15.427
Boyd will be dead before you're done.

18:15.511 --> 18:17.554
Well, she's my patient.

18:17.638 --> 18:21.391
We both know in the time we come from,
medical nanites more or less replace you.

18:21.475 --> 18:23.977
Okay, if you want to be helpful,
why don't you use your computer

18:24.061 --> 18:26.772
and hack into the CDC and find out
what kind of progress they've made?

18:26.855 --> 18:27.815
The who?

18:27.898 --> 18:30.109
Hack into them too if you'd like.

18:30.192 --> 18:33.112
Like either the Center for Disease Control
or the World Health Organization

18:33.195 --> 18:36.156
is gonna know how to deal with a virus
designed in the future?

18:36.240 --> 18:38.242
Let's contact the 15th century
and hire an exorcist.

18:38.325 --> 18:40.327
Would you just please stop talking?

18:40.410 --> 18:43.497
-[Grace] You little power tripper.
-I am trying to save your life.

18:43.580 --> 18:45.582
[coughs]

18:48.919 --> 18:51.839
Well, you're not doing a very good job.
I feel awful.

18:53.132 --> 18:54.133
Where are you going?

18:55.717 --> 18:57.344
To the bathroom.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.320
[coughs]

19:18.115 --> 19:20.117
[coughs]

19:40.721 --> 19:44.141
-Hi, we're, uh--
-This is a designated exit, sir.

19:45.267 --> 19:47.811
Oh, sorry, uh, w--

19:53.025 --> 19:55.110
-What's he doing?
-Just his job.

19:55.194 --> 19:56.612
Everybody relax.

19:57.487 --> 19:59.406
All of these guys could be Faction.

19:59.489 --> 20:01.700
If it goes down,
I'll take the booth guard.

20:01.783 --> 20:05.704
Easy. We're not gonna get our warhead
if we start shooting people.

20:13.295 --> 20:16.089
[Carly] We are trapped in here.
There's cameras everywhere.

20:16.173 --> 20:17.799
Everybody calm the fuck down.

20:23.388 --> 20:25.807
-The base is under quarantine, sir.
-I'm aware of that.

20:25.891 --> 20:28.894
I'm Special Agent Grant MacLaren.
I'm with the FBI.

20:28.977 --> 20:32.814
I've got a meeting with Captain Garcia
on urgent business.

20:36.818 --> 20:38.278
All appointments
have been canceled--

20:38.362 --> 20:40.364
Vice Admiral Donahue
arranged the meeting,

20:40.447 --> 20:43.158
so I assure you the meeting
has not been canceled.

20:43.242 --> 20:44.076
Check again.

20:46.245 --> 20:47.663
[urgent typing]

20:53.085 --> 20:53.919
Carly.

21:04.638 --> 21:06.807
All right, I see it here now, sir.

21:06.890 --> 21:08.392
Great. Open the gate?

21:09.393 --> 21:11.270
Just waiting for your passes
to print, sir.

21:15.148 --> 21:16.608
Building Four.

21:16.692 --> 21:17.693
On your right.

21:18.527 --> 21:19.361
Appreciate it.

21:24.992 --> 21:26.827
[engine starts]

21:29.579 --> 21:31.290
[coughing]

21:37.921 --> 21:39.006
[knocking on door]

21:39.089 --> 21:40.674
[Grace] What?

21:40.757 --> 21:41.591
You all right?

21:41.675 --> 21:42.884
No, I'm dying,

21:42.968 --> 21:45.429
but I still need to go
to the bathroom periodically.

21:49.391 --> 21:50.684
[water flows]

21:50.767 --> 21:52.978
You've been in there for a while.
I was just concerned.

21:54.396 --> 21:55.397
I'm fine!

22:00.152 --> 22:01.987
[toilet flushes]

22:24.843 --> 22:26.345
Did you see where
she put the nanites?

22:28.180 --> 22:29.181
They're in there.

22:35.228 --> 22:37.355
[Jenny coughing]

22:45.489 --> 22:47.115
[sizzling sound]

22:54.664 --> 22:55.665
[soft cough]

22:56.249 --> 22:57.250
Wait, what are you doing?

22:57.334 --> 23:02.089
Shh. Shh.

23:18.814 --> 23:20.023
Captain Garcia?

23:20.107 --> 23:22.192
Special Agent MacLaven from the FBI.

23:22.275 --> 23:23.276
That's MacLaren.

23:23.360 --> 23:24.820
Your pass says "MacLaven."

23:24.903 --> 23:27.322
[Garcia] Agent MacLaren knows his name,
Miss Jackson.

23:27.405 --> 23:28.573
Should I issue a new pass?

23:28.657 --> 23:31.159
He won't be here that long.
You can go.

23:31.993 --> 23:33.537
That doesn't sound promising.

23:34.538 --> 23:35.747
It is what it is.

23:35.831 --> 23:38.708
I'm sure the Admiral relayed the urgency
of our request.

23:38.792 --> 23:41.586
And your pass says "MacLaven."
People make mistakes.

23:41.670 --> 23:43.296
[Trevor] Our request isn't one of them.

23:44.631 --> 23:48.260
How does that particular warhead
possibly help prevent a pandemic?

23:48.343 --> 23:50.345
I'm not authorized to explain.

23:50.428 --> 23:53.181
Shame. I'd pay good money to hear it.

23:53.265 --> 23:55.559
While you're deciding
whether to help us or not,

23:55.642 --> 23:57.435
a deadly virus
is spreading worldwide.

23:57.519 --> 23:59.521
You're being
a little melodramatic, aren't you?

23:59.604 --> 24:00.981
Flu kills people every year.

24:01.064 --> 24:02.983
It's far worse than what's been reported.

24:03.066 --> 24:04.860
There are millions of people
infected already,

24:04.943 --> 24:06.570
even if they haven't presented symptoms.

24:06.653 --> 24:07.946
And it's spreading exponentially.

24:08.029 --> 24:11.324
The Admiral's email said you'd
be coming in with CDC personnel.

24:11.408 --> 24:13.034
Is that supposed to be him?

24:13.118 --> 24:14.327
They're specialists.

24:14.411 --> 24:18.957
Uh-huh. This is making less
and less sense the more I hear.

24:19.040 --> 24:20.959
If you'd like to call the Admiral,
I'm sure--

24:21.042 --> 24:24.379
Not necessary. My orders were clear.

24:24.462 --> 24:28.383
The warhead is being separated
from the torpedo as we speak,

24:28.466 --> 24:30.385
for what good that could possibly do.

24:30.468 --> 24:33.221
It's being loaded directly
into your vehicle.

24:33.305 --> 24:36.600
I just don't like ordnance leaving
my base without an explanation.

24:36.683 --> 24:39.144
Trust me when I say you're
helping to save millions of lives.

24:39.227 --> 24:40.645
I hope I'm one of them.

24:40.729 --> 24:43.148
I feel like shit, and so do
half the people on my base.

24:43.231 --> 24:45.525
I will personally make sure
that the people of this base

24:45.609 --> 24:48.778
are among the first to receive
the antidote once it's ready.

24:54.075 --> 24:56.411
[distant child crying]

25:17.349 --> 25:20.393
David. You should go home.

25:20.477 --> 25:22.604
Yeah, I'm just gonna sit for a bit.

25:22.687 --> 25:24.522
You've done your fair share.

25:24.606 --> 25:26.775
Government's getting serious--
there's looting going on.

25:26.858 --> 25:27.734
Looting?

25:28.735 --> 25:29.819
[chuckles]

25:33.740 --> 25:37.202
I saw a movie a few months back
where something like this happened.

25:38.203 --> 25:39.579
It was very believable.

25:39.663 --> 25:41.456
But I never bought the looting.

25:42.624 --> 25:45.710
"Hey, everyone's getting sick,
so let's--

25:45.794 --> 25:47.796
let's break that window
and steal that TV."

25:47.879 --> 25:49.506
I-I don't get that.

25:49.589 --> 25:50.423
Me neither.

25:50.507 --> 25:53.009
I mean, you get a pretty decent TV
for next to nothing nowadays.

25:53.093 --> 25:55.178
Compared to what I got mine for? God.

25:55.262 --> 25:57.180
-David.
-The expensive part is the cable.

25:57.264 --> 25:58.598
David.

25:58.682 --> 25:59.683
Go home.

26:01.101 --> 26:02.560
Yeah.

26:02.644 --> 26:05.355
No, I-I'm waiting for Marcy to come by.

26:05.438 --> 26:07.065
[distant child crying]

26:10.193 --> 26:11.403
Maybe I should go home.

26:11.486 --> 26:12.487
That's a good idea.

26:54.863 --> 26:57.157
I should've swung that fucking axe.

26:57.240 --> 26:58.867
Forbes would have shot you.

26:58.950 --> 27:01.953
Thirty percent of the human population.

27:03.455 --> 27:04.664
Including all of you.

27:04.748 --> 27:07.250
[Trevor] Boss, you can't blame yourself
for not being able

27:07.334 --> 27:08.960
to foresee the unthinkable.

27:09.044 --> 27:10.628
That's why they call it unthinkable.

27:10.712 --> 27:11.921
Can't think it.

27:12.005 --> 27:13.590
Still, I know how you feel.

27:13.673 --> 27:16.301
I'm the one that provided the Faction
with the virus.

27:16.384 --> 27:17.552
You were drugged.

27:17.635 --> 27:19.012
Again.

27:19.095 --> 27:20.722
Stop. It's done.

27:21.556 --> 27:23.183
You know, I've been
wondering about that.

27:24.517 --> 27:26.686
Maybe the Director can undo this.

27:26.770 --> 27:27.604
How?

27:27.687 --> 27:29.689
The future can only send
a consciousness back

27:29.773 --> 27:32.025
as far as the most
recent traveler, right?

27:32.108 --> 27:35.195
And travelers are arriving all the time,

27:35.278 --> 27:37.989
all over the world,
as part of the grand plan.

27:39.282 --> 27:42.535
But the last one had
to have been months ago,

27:42.619 --> 27:46.915
before the Director went down...
before all this happened.

27:46.998 --> 27:50.001
The Faction might not be able
to send consciousness back,

27:50.085 --> 27:52.796
or establish a TELL, but messengers count.

27:52.879 --> 27:55.965
It's still a transfer
of information from the future.

27:56.049 --> 27:57.467
[coughing]

27:57.550 --> 27:58.802
He's right.

27:58.885 --> 28:01.971
Messengers cause the same ripples
in space-time as travelers.

28:02.055 --> 28:04.599
[Philip] And we know the Faction
has sent messengers recently.

28:05.433 --> 28:06.935
They thought of everything.

28:08.686 --> 28:11.189
Well, guys, on the bright side...

28:12.065 --> 28:13.608
we're almost home.

28:19.489 --> 28:20.573
[Carly coughs]

28:21.574 --> 28:23.326
Hard to believe
where we're walking right now

28:23.410 --> 28:25.870
is under a kilometer of ice
in a few hundred years.

28:25.954 --> 28:28.581
The domes get built right over there.

28:28.665 --> 28:31.334
I've only ever seen the shelters
from the inside.

28:55.191 --> 28:57.777
[Carly coughs]

29:03.700 --> 29:04.784
[Jenny gasping]

29:06.578 --> 29:09.581
What's wrong? What's wrong?

29:09.664 --> 29:12.125
[gasping]

29:12.208 --> 29:13.209
Aw, shit.

29:13.293 --> 29:14.711
Marcy!

29:18.840 --> 29:21.760
[Jenny gasping]

29:26.181 --> 29:27.390
What happened?

29:27.474 --> 29:29.684
She shouldn't be having
respiratory issues at this stage.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.519
[Grace] You didn't trust me.
I had no choice.

29:31.603 --> 29:32.562
What did you do?

29:32.645 --> 29:34.939
[Grace] I instructed the nanites
to pull the virus

29:35.023 --> 29:36.816
into red blood cells
where it can't survive.

29:36.900 --> 29:38.401
She should be getting better.

29:38.485 --> 29:40.528
The Faction predicted
that countermeasure.

29:40.612 --> 29:43.448
The virus blocks red blood cells'
ability to carry oxygen.

29:43.531 --> 29:44.574
She's suffocating.

29:44.657 --> 29:45.492
Turn them off.

29:45.575 --> 29:48.411
Deactivating the nanites will be
like flushing them down the drain.

29:48.495 --> 29:50.163
Turn them off, or she's gonna die.

29:50.246 --> 29:52.081
Either way, they're useless now.

30:03.343 --> 30:04.427
[Grace] There. She's better.

30:04.511 --> 30:05.929
No, she's not better!

30:06.012 --> 30:07.889
She's right back to where she started.

30:07.972 --> 30:09.724
They've been ahead of us
this whole time.

30:09.808 --> 30:12.477
Did you not think that the Faction
was going to factor in nanites?

30:12.560 --> 30:14.395
This is all because
you didn't trust me!

30:14.479 --> 30:15.563
Why should I?

30:15.647 --> 30:18.817
You're alive because of me
and perfectly healthy.

30:18.900 --> 30:19.901
Am I?

30:20.819 --> 30:23.905
When you reset me,
you left out some things.

30:23.988 --> 30:25.198
What'd you leave out, Grace?

30:25.281 --> 30:27.242
This is what you want to talk about
when we're dying?

30:27.325 --> 30:29.327
I'm not dying, you are!

30:32.163 --> 30:34.749
-[Kat coughing, groaning]
-[man on TV]  Over to you.

30:34.833 --> 30:37.836
[woman]  Concern continues to grow
regarding the global virus

30:37.919 --> 30:40.713
that has ballooned
to epidemic proportions.

30:40.797 --> 30:44.217
The World Health Organization
has declared a state of emergency

30:44.300 --> 30:47.595
as the infection continues
to spread at a record rate.

30:47.679 --> 30:50.598
Health authorities in London,
Paris, and Rome

30:50.682 --> 30:52.892
have begun seeing the death toll rise,

30:52.976 --> 30:55.979
and fear we may be far
from the end of the global pandemic...

30:56.855 --> 30:59.023
[voicemail]  You've reached
Special Agent Grant MacLaren.

30:59.107 --> 31:01.818
[news broadcast continues faintly]

31:14.455 --> 31:15.290
[clicks]

31:15.373 --> 31:17.750
[woman]  Rioting and looting continue
to run rampant

31:17.834 --> 31:21.504
among fears of the virus that is
plaguing nearly every nation on Earth.

31:21.588 --> 31:24.382
Local authorities are struggling
to maintain order

31:24.465 --> 31:27.176
due to low numbers,
as a result of their own members

31:27.260 --> 31:29.220
falling ill from the disease.

31:29.304 --> 31:30.763
[tap running]

31:40.899 --> 31:43.610
Recovery itself continues to be an issue,

31:43.693 --> 31:46.070
and while the death toll
continues to rise,

31:46.154 --> 31:48.448
fewer and fewer people
are finding themselves

31:48.531 --> 31:51.200
fully recovering from the deadly disease.

31:51.284 --> 31:53.411
Officials continue to search
for answers...

31:59.667 --> 32:01.002
[MacLaren] Good luck.

32:01.085 --> 32:04.631
[Philip coughing, groaning]

32:04.714 --> 32:05.590
Set it down.

32:07.425 --> 32:08.593
Want to take a break?

32:08.676 --> 32:09.677
[coughs]

32:12.555 --> 32:14.349
-No, I'm good.
-Okay.

32:14.432 --> 32:15.725
Come on.

32:16.351 --> 32:17.352
Almost there.

32:20.813 --> 32:22.315
[Carly groans]

32:41.793 --> 32:43.294
Guns on the ground!

32:52.637 --> 32:54.055
Secure the warhead!

32:59.185 --> 33:00.395
Where are you taking it?

33:00.478 --> 33:02.605
[Forbes]
Somewhere it can't power the Director.

33:03.398 --> 33:04.899
Oh, come on.

33:04.983 --> 33:06.818
Of course we knew
you'd try something like this

33:06.901 --> 33:08.569
when you didn't get the uranium.

33:08.653 --> 33:09.946
Don't beat yourself up.

33:10.029 --> 33:12.156
You're a good team,
and we need numbers.

33:12.240 --> 33:13.866
We should be working together.

33:13.950 --> 33:15.410
I don't think so.

33:15.493 --> 33:17.328
The Director had its chance.

33:17.412 --> 33:20.081
Didn't change a goddamn thing
in the future.

33:20.164 --> 33:22.125
Other than create the Faction.

33:22.208 --> 33:25.294
The future we came from, you all died
in the collapse of Shelter 41.

33:25.378 --> 33:26.796
[laughs]

33:26.879 --> 33:28.339
Why can't I wrap my head around that?

33:28.423 --> 33:30.174
Why am I not surprised?

33:32.427 --> 33:33.261
All right.

33:34.429 --> 33:35.972
Thanks for the plutonium.

33:36.055 --> 33:38.307
We'll make sure to put it to good use.

33:38.391 --> 33:39.392
Let's go!

33:39.475 --> 33:40.685
[MacLaren] Plutonium?

33:40.768 --> 33:43.771
What, do you think we brought
a nuclear warhead in here?

33:43.855 --> 33:47.150
I thought you said that they were
watching all of our communications.

33:47.233 --> 33:51.362
There was a typo in my Admiral Donahue
email that may have thrown them off,

33:51.446 --> 33:54.073
when I wrote Mark 45 warhead
instead of-- uh, what was that?

33:54.157 --> 33:55.366
-Uh, Mark 46?
-Oh-- oh, right.

33:55.450 --> 33:58.536
'Cause the 45 was nuclear.
That makes total sense.

33:59.120 --> 34:03.291
Except the Mark 45 torpedo
was decommissioned in 1976.

34:03.374 --> 34:04.250
On a Wednesday.

34:04.333 --> 34:07.837
[MacLaren] Never in a million years
could we get a nuclear warhead

34:07.920 --> 34:09.756
from a US naval station.

34:09.839 --> 34:10.923
Your friends walked away

34:11.007 --> 34:14.218
with a conventional
Mark 46 antisubmarine warhead.

34:14.677 --> 34:17.096
-[beeps]
-[MacLaren]  Totally different.

34:17.180 --> 34:18.639
[softly] Shit.

34:18.723 --> 34:21.350
Carly, I think they're
far enough away now.

34:22.935 --> 34:24.312
-[beeps]
-[charge fires]

34:39.952 --> 34:42.705
[groaning]

34:56.719 --> 34:59.263
Device is in place and activated!

35:12.944 --> 35:13.945
Turn around.

35:20.118 --> 35:21.410
Come on, Mac.

35:21.994 --> 35:23.412
I'm unarmed.

35:23.913 --> 35:26.249
You really think you can kill me
in cold blood?

35:26.332 --> 35:27.542
I really do.

35:44.684 --> 35:46.394
[groaning]

35:46.477 --> 35:48.271
[screaming]

36:00.616 --> 36:03.494
[both screaming]

36:09.125 --> 36:11.127
[grunting]

36:14.046 --> 36:15.923
I'm traveler 4991.

36:16.591 --> 36:17.592
It worked.

36:19.385 --> 36:21.179
The Director's back up and running.

36:22.180 --> 36:24.974
The cure has been sent to the 21st.

36:25.057 --> 36:28.060
The encrypted beacon on the device
was activated

36:28.144 --> 36:30.771
almost the moment
power to the Director was cut off.

36:30.855 --> 36:32.940
It took some time for us
to find and recover it,

36:33.024 --> 36:35.359
but we got to it without them knowing.

36:35.443 --> 36:37.987
Even when we broke through,
the energy source was only capable

36:38.070 --> 36:40.948
of powering the Director
for three seconds--

36:41.032 --> 36:43.409
enough time for the Director
to reroute the power to itself

36:43.492 --> 36:44.493
through the network,

36:44.577 --> 36:47.205
cut off the Faction's access
to the reactor,

36:47.288 --> 36:48.873
design the cure...

36:50.208 --> 36:51.876
to win the war.

36:51.959 --> 36:53.377
How many Faction are still here?

36:53.461 --> 36:56.672
It's impossible to know how many
were sent into the quantum frame.

36:56.756 --> 36:58.925
The Director won't have a TELL
for all of them.

37:04.222 --> 37:05.848
[cell phone buzzes]

37:07.475 --> 37:08.476
[MacLaren]  Kat?

37:08.559 --> 37:12.563
Grant. I have been so worried.
I've been trying to call you.

37:12.647 --> 37:15.149
I'm sorry. But all the work
we've been doing, it's paid off.

37:15.233 --> 37:16.234
You're gonna be okay.

37:16.317 --> 37:18.402
I'm so sick.
Don't say that if it's not real.

37:18.486 --> 37:20.321
No, I promise,
we've had a breakthrough.

37:20.404 --> 37:21.656
Watch the news.

37:21.739 --> 37:24.700
I'll-- I'll be-- I'll be back
with you as fast as I can.

37:24.784 --> 37:26.244
I'm worried about the baby.

37:26.327 --> 37:28.537
I'll be back tomorrow at the latest.

37:28.621 --> 37:30.206
[helicopter whirring]

37:31.666 --> 37:32.708
Maybe sooner.

37:44.095 --> 37:45.304
He didn't answer.

38:00.695 --> 38:01.821
We did it.

38:01.904 --> 38:04.115
That means we should be able
to wake you up soon.

38:04.198 --> 38:06.200
[Grace] One, she can't hear you.

38:06.284 --> 38:08.411
Two, I can't believe you're
giving her the cure first.

38:08.494 --> 38:09.537
I'm standing right here!

38:09.620 --> 38:11.080
Boyd is far more sick.

38:11.163 --> 38:12.665
Am I at least next?

38:12.748 --> 38:16.294
No. The newly arrived traveler
in a very sick host body,

38:16.377 --> 38:17.378
then you.

38:17.461 --> 38:19.213
Ohh, just admit you hate me.

38:24.135 --> 38:26.554
[television playing]

38:30.433 --> 38:31.517
Kat.

38:32.351 --> 38:34.395
Sweetheart, hey. Hey, wake up.

38:34.478 --> 38:35.730
You're home.

38:35.813 --> 38:37.481
Yeah, and I've got something for you.

38:37.565 --> 38:39.650
[television shuts off]

38:39.734 --> 38:40.568
Come on.

38:40.651 --> 38:42.236
What is it?

38:42.320 --> 38:45.197
No, I can't take any medicine,
in case it affects the baby.

38:45.281 --> 38:47.116
I got this directly from the CDC.

38:47.199 --> 38:49.452
I made sure to ask. It's perfectly safe.

38:50.202 --> 38:51.162
Here.

38:54.165 --> 38:55.333
[soft groan]

39:02.173 --> 39:03.799
Works really fast.

39:08.346 --> 39:09.555
I'm gonna let you sleep.

39:09.638 --> 39:12.892
No. Can you just lie with me for a bit?

39:12.975 --> 39:14.477
Just for a minute.

39:14.560 --> 39:16.395
I would like nothing more.

39:22.234 --> 39:25.404
[Kat] Mm. Ah...

39:35.790 --> 39:36.624
Jeff?

39:38.250 --> 39:39.085
Jeffrey?

39:40.086 --> 39:41.712
Jeffrey?

39:41.796 --> 39:42.797
[Jeff] Carly?

39:42.880 --> 39:45.174
[Jeffrey Jr. crying]

39:48.010 --> 39:50.930
I know you were trying to call.
I had to get this first.

39:51.514 --> 39:53.516
It's a treatment for the virus.

39:53.599 --> 39:55.017
What? Where did you get it?

39:56.811 --> 39:58.020
Doesn't matter.

39:58.104 --> 39:59.313
It'll cure you both.

40:00.398 --> 40:02.316
I was so scared.

40:02.400 --> 40:04.360
I didn't know what to do.
You didn't come home.

40:04.443 --> 40:06.779
-I didn't know what to do but hold him.
-[crying]

40:10.825 --> 40:12.576
[soft coughing]

40:12.660 --> 40:14.286
Give him to me. I know, I know.

40:14.370 --> 40:16.789
I'm supposed to go to work
as soon as you got home, but...

40:18.207 --> 40:21.127
It's okay. Just rest a while first.

40:21.627 --> 40:23.045
I know, baby, I know, I know.

40:23.129 --> 40:24.755
-Yeah, I think I will.
-I know.

40:28.551 --> 40:30.177
[man]  The cure was developed by scientists

40:30.261 --> 40:33.013
at the Center for Disease Control
and is now being mass-produced

40:33.097 --> 40:34.932
and sent to health officials
around the world.

40:35.015 --> 40:36.767
[door opens, closes]

40:36.851 --> 40:37.852
Marce.

40:37.935 --> 40:40.604
Uh... did you hear that they
cured this thing?

40:42.022 --> 40:43.858
You're probably the one
that came up with it.

40:43.941 --> 40:45.151
Not this time.

40:45.234 --> 40:46.986
Did you stay inside?

40:47.987 --> 40:49.363
No.

40:49.447 --> 40:51.073
No, I was helping
at one of the shelters.

40:51.157 --> 40:53.367
David, you could have been exposed.

40:53.451 --> 40:54.869
Yeah, I was.

40:57.288 --> 40:59.707
The people I work with are the first ones
to be forgotten

40:59.790 --> 41:02.209
when something like this... happens.

41:02.293 --> 41:03.919
You're not gonna give me that, are you?

41:04.003 --> 41:05.171
Only if you're sick.

41:06.755 --> 41:08.382
Speaking of sick...

41:08.466 --> 41:14.180
this man I know just collapsed
while I was trying to give him soup.

41:15.014 --> 41:16.223
Your pulse is good.

41:16.307 --> 41:18.058
And while they were
wheeling him out...

41:19.310 --> 41:21.812
I felt like one of those minor characters

41:21.896 --> 41:23.647
in a movie that does not end well.

41:24.690 --> 41:26.108
And I thought to myself...

41:26.901 --> 41:30.112
Marcy's gonna give me shit
if I end up dying from this.

41:35.493 --> 41:37.161
Because I can't help myself.

41:37.995 --> 41:39.914
You mean from helping others.

41:39.997 --> 41:41.749
Yeah, but isn't that what you do, too?

41:41.832 --> 41:42.708
Open your mouth.

41:42.791 --> 41:44.627
Your way of doing things...

41:44.710 --> 41:46.629
is more impressive.

41:47.755 --> 41:48.881
All right, you're not sick.

41:51.342 --> 41:53.260
Well, maybe you should give me
the shot anyway.

41:53.344 --> 41:54.637
No symptoms.

41:54.720 --> 41:56.514
If you were exposed,
it means you're immune.

41:56.597 --> 42:00.142
So, find your friend who collapsed
and give this to him.

42:01.894 --> 42:03.562
-Okay.
-Yeah?

42:05.356 --> 42:07.274
What, you're leaving again?

42:07.358 --> 42:08.776
I have other patients.

42:08.859 --> 42:11.403
I wanted to make sure you were okay.

42:11.487 --> 42:13.239
Wow. House call.

42:13.322 --> 42:16.158
Well, I'll be back later,
if that's all right.

42:16.825 --> 42:17.910
Don't wait up.

42:23.165 --> 42:24.375
Yeah, I probably will.

42:29.964 --> 42:31.674
Thought you were going home.

42:31.757 --> 42:34.677
Just came back
to check on my patients.

42:34.760 --> 42:36.637
How you guys feeling?

42:36.720 --> 42:38.347
[Trevor groans]

42:38.430 --> 42:39.807
Much better, thank you.

42:39.890 --> 42:40.891
Good.

42:40.975 --> 42:44.270
You'll be happy to know that the CDC
has set up treatment centers

42:44.353 --> 42:46.689
to disseminate the antiviral en masse,

42:46.772 --> 42:47.982
and Jenny...

42:48.065 --> 42:51.193
that is, Jenny 3.0...

42:52.403 --> 42:53.529
is coordinating deliveries.

42:54.863 --> 42:55.990
[Boyd] Marcy?

42:56.073 --> 42:57.825
Oh, yeah, she woke up a while ago.

43:01.745 --> 43:03.080
-Hey.
-Hey.

43:04.039 --> 43:05.666
How you feelin'?

43:05.749 --> 43:08.127
Hmm, like shit. But I'll live.

43:08.210 --> 43:10.212
[Grace] I'll also live, thanks for asking.

43:11.213 --> 43:13.799
I still haven't heard
from the other two members of my team,

43:13.882 --> 43:14.925
but I'm hoping...

43:15.009 --> 43:16.343
[knock on door]
