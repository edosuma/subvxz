00:33.213 --> 00:35.314
You guys see my rad new camera?

00:35.382 --> 00:37.249
I'm pursuing a newfound passion.

00:37.317 --> 00:39.218
Crime scene photography.

00:39.286 --> 00:40.786
Ooh, like the guys on <i>CSI?</i>

00:40.854 --> 00:42.688
Yes, Klaus, remember we were
watching <i>CSI</i> together,

00:42.756 --> 00:44.824
and I was, like,
"I want to do that"?

00:44.891 --> 00:46.458
And you were, like,
"You totally should."

00:46.526 --> 00:47.860
Ring a bell? Not at all.

00:47.928 --> 00:50.196
Are you sure you weren't
just high on angel dust,

00:50.263 --> 00:51.430
talking to the ceiling fan?

00:51.498 --> 00:52.598
Oh, that's right.

00:52.666 --> 00:53.966
Anyway, I need a portfolio

00:54.034 --> 00:55.801
of some gruesome,
hard-to-look-at photos.

00:55.869 --> 00:58.838
And I'm not talking about shots
of the new Asian Kenny Rogers,

00:58.905 --> 01:00.406
so don't even make that joke.

01:00.473 --> 01:01.640
Don't got the time.

01:02.809 --> 01:04.108
Ooh! My first photo!

01:04.177 --> 01:06.278
I took down the stop
sign on Forestwood Drive.

01:06.346 --> 01:08.614
Looks like I got a bite.

01:08.682 --> 01:10.382
Steve's up! Mornin',

01:10.450 --> 01:12.184
everyb... Aah!

01:12.252 --> 01:13.586
I'm okay.

01:13.653 --> 01:15.020
Steve, a homosexual giant called.

01:15.088 --> 01:16.856
He said he wants his shirt back.

01:18.091 --> 01:19.225
Hello?

01:19.292 --> 01:20.693
False alarm, baby.

01:20.760 --> 01:22.561
It was under the day bed.

01:22.629 --> 01:23.629
Sorry for the confusion.

01:23.697 --> 01:25.130
Got to go.

01:25.198 --> 01:27.967
I blamed a lot of people
for this one. Mm-hmm.

01:28.034 --> 01:29.301
Turns out he found it.

01:29.369 --> 01:30.703
So whose shirt is that?

01:30.770 --> 01:32.838
Mine. The guy at the store
told me it was a small,

01:32.906 --> 01:34.840
but when I got home and
took it out of the bag,

01:34.908 --> 01:36.008
it was a double X-L.

01:36.076 --> 01:37.076
So, take it back.

01:37.143 --> 01:38.344
Oh.

01:38.411 --> 01:39.778
I already opened the package.

01:39.846 --> 01:41.814
What if he doesn't
let me return it?

01:41.882 --> 01:43.282
I don't prefer confrontation.

01:43.350 --> 01:44.750
Son, go upstairs, find your nads--

01:44.818 --> 01:46.252
they're probably in your Lego tub--

01:46.319 --> 01:48.787
then go back to that store
and demand the correct size.

01:48.855 --> 01:50.256
Leave Steve alone.

01:50.323 --> 01:52.825
He's a gentle soul,
and I love him for it.

01:52.893 --> 01:55.127
And I love you, Momma Bear.

01:58.765 --> 02:00.599
I'm not okay!

02:02.903 --> 02:04.136
Is Steve always this passive?

02:04.204 --> 02:05.738
God, I better look into this.

02:05.805 --> 02:07.740
Oh, you're worrying
about a hill of bananas.

02:07.807 --> 02:09.375
Am I? I don't think so.

02:09.442 --> 02:10.876
By the way, "Hill of bananas"?

02:10.943 --> 02:12.177
I like that.

02:12.245 --> 02:13.679
Is that a real expression? No.

02:13.747 --> 02:15.514
Good for you!

02:18.318 --> 02:21.520
Okay, kid, let's see how
wimpy you really are.

02:23.156 --> 02:24.456
Oh.

02:24.524 --> 02:26.759
Oh, God, that's peppery!

02:31.364 --> 02:32.731
It's all right, sugar.

02:32.799 --> 02:34.667
We'll cross together.

02:36.503 --> 02:38.404
Brenda's got you.

02:38.471 --> 02:41.106
You're her whole world right now.

02:41.174 --> 02:42.975
Brenda's my dead cousin.

02:43.043 --> 02:45.711
She's watching over both of us.

02:55.622 --> 02:57.222
French bread pizza.

02:57.290 --> 02:59.158
My favorite!

03:00.393 --> 03:01.460
Come on, Steve.

03:01.528 --> 03:02.628
Do something!

03:02.696 --> 03:03.862
Don't start crying.

03:03.930 --> 03:05.931
Why are you pulling
out your cell phone?

03:05.999 --> 03:07.933
Who are you calling?

03:08.001 --> 03:10.002
STEVE Daddy!

03:10.070 --> 03:11.337
Pick me up!

03:11.404 --> 03:13.605
I'm sick!

03:22.949 --> 03:24.183
Oh, hell, no.

03:25.485 --> 03:26.518
Hey. Hey, boy. Dad!

03:26.586 --> 03:27.820
What are you doing?

03:27.887 --> 03:29.955
I was gonna meet the
guys at the new park,

03:30.023 --> 03:32.224
but I didn't realize it
was gonna be so hilly.

03:32.292 --> 03:34.360
Can I get a ride
to the top? No way.

03:34.427 --> 03:36.695
Jose, listen, obstacles
are meant to be overcome.

03:36.763 --> 03:38.897
Rise to the challenge
and get up that hill.

03:38.965 --> 03:40.766
Go play with your
friends in the park.

03:45.739 --> 03:47.973
Nah. Toshi'll text me a picture.

03:48.041 --> 03:51.610
Between me and you,
I just want to see the landscaping.

03:51.678 --> 03:53.479
You shy away from... Oh, God.

03:53.546 --> 03:54.646
Oh, my God!

03:55.949 --> 03:58.417
You shy away from every challenge.

03:58.485 --> 03:59.852
I'm shy.

03:59.919 --> 04:02.388
Well, you can't shy away
from a crate of oranges.

04:02.455 --> 04:03.689
A crate of oranges?

04:03.757 --> 04:05.457
Yes. Imagine some day you live

04:05.525 --> 04:07.092
in a four-story walk-up apartment.

04:07.160 --> 04:08.293
What, like a brownstone?

04:08.361 --> 04:10.396
Yes, like a brownstone.

04:10.463 --> 04:13.399
Now, you've got to get a heavy
crate of oranges upstairs.

04:13.466 --> 04:15.200
I don't really like oranges.
They're for your mother.

04:15.268 --> 04:16.601
She's waiting in your
apartment for them.

04:16.668 --> 04:17.870
Oh, yay! Mom's visiting?

04:17.937 --> 04:20.039
I can't wait to show her the city.

04:20.106 --> 04:21.240
No, she's not visiting.

04:21.307 --> 04:22.541
She's sick.

04:22.609 --> 04:23.742
And she needs those oranges.

04:23.810 --> 04:25.077
Oh, geez.

04:25.145 --> 04:27.413
Well, I'll just pay
someone to bring them up.

04:27.480 --> 04:28.680
Pay someone? No!

04:28.748 --> 04:30.516
That's no way to
solve your problems.

04:30.583 --> 04:32.117
Look, she needs those oranges.

04:32.185 --> 04:33.719
She's dying,
okay? She's got scurvy.

04:33.787 --> 04:35.821
Without those oranges,
she'll be dead by morning.

04:35.889 --> 04:36.555
Oh, my God!

04:36.623 --> 04:38.390
Mommy, no!

04:42.796 --> 04:44.430
Whew! Long mission.

04:44.497 --> 04:46.165
China be huge!

04:46.232 --> 04:47.900
What up, Demi? Where Whoopi at?

04:47.967 --> 04:49.401
You probably don't know that movie.

04:49.469 --> 04:50.569
How old are you?

04:50.637 --> 04:51.837
How old am I?

04:51.905 --> 04:53.972
Hey, Reggie. So you just get back?

04:54.040 --> 04:56.175
Yeah. Now I'm on a bigger mission--

04:56.242 --> 04:57.543
to ask you out.

04:57.610 --> 04:58.877
Yes!

04:58.945 --> 05:01.547
I mean, yeah, sure, whatever.

05:01.614 --> 05:03.148
I get it. You're playing it cool.

05:03.216 --> 05:04.783
You know that is my
signature temperature.

05:04.851 --> 05:07.853
In fact, I am so cool,
I'm gonna go pick up myself

05:07.921 --> 05:08.921
one of those
polyester-style jackets.

05:08.988 --> 05:10.189
What do you call 'em?

05:10.256 --> 05:11.323
They're kind of slippery.

05:11.391 --> 05:12.491
They swish. Windbreaker.

05:12.559 --> 05:13.892
That's the word.

05:13.960 --> 05:16.161
Girl, you did not help
me at all there, did you?

05:20.233 --> 05:23.569
Well, I took the day off
to follow Steve yesterday.

05:23.636 --> 05:25.771
Turns out I was right
to be worried about him.

05:25.839 --> 05:27.072
You followed Steve all day?

05:27.140 --> 05:28.373
Yeah, I do stuff like that.

05:28.441 --> 05:29.842
Followed you last week.

05:29.909 --> 05:31.643
I don't know what you thought
was in your butt hole

05:31.711 --> 05:33.078
in the Target parking lot,

05:33.146 --> 05:34.980
but you were... you were
really trying to find it.

05:35.048 --> 05:36.081
Anyway, Steve avoids
every obstacle.

05:36.149 --> 05:37.449
He's a total wimp.

05:37.517 --> 05:39.785
When I was a kid,
you used to get your ass kicked

05:39.853 --> 05:41.019
if you were a wimp.

05:41.087 --> 05:42.554
Stan, stop. He's a good kid.

05:42.622 --> 05:44.990
He does well in school,
he's not on drugs.

05:45.058 --> 05:46.658
Love him for who he is.

05:46.726 --> 05:48.060
Hi. Called in a to-go order

05:48.128 --> 05:49.928
for a PB and banana on wheat.

05:49.996 --> 05:52.731
That'll be two kisses.

05:52.799 --> 05:54.633
Ooh, I only got a five.

05:54.701 --> 05:56.001
I'm gonna need change.

05:56.069 --> 05:58.570
Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah.

05:58.638 --> 06:00.239
And three's your change.

06:00.306 --> 06:01.373
Mwah, mwah, mwah.

06:05.011 --> 06:08.080
Seriously, what-what were you
trying to get out of your butt?

06:08.148 --> 06:10.582
It was just itchy.

06:10.650 --> 06:12.584

06:26.499 --> 06:27.466
What are you talking about?

06:27.534 --> 06:28.700
You're afraid of confrontation,

06:28.768 --> 06:30.102
you avoid physical challenges,

06:30.170 --> 06:32.471
and as soon as anything
gets difficult, you give up.

06:32.539 --> 06:33.305
So?

06:33.373 --> 06:34.973
So?! You're a wimp!

06:35.041 --> 06:37.242
And you need a bully
to toughen you up.

06:37.310 --> 06:38.810
Well, now you got one. Me!

06:38.878 --> 06:40.245
Now give me your lunch!

06:40.313 --> 06:41.813
Stop! Get off me!

06:41.881 --> 06:44.716
Yeah, that's what your
mom said last night.

06:53.448 --> 06:54.982
Whoa. Slow down there, champ.

06:55.028 --> 06:56.295
How was your day?

06:56.362 --> 06:57.529
Bad.

06:57.597 --> 06:58.997
It-It was bad.

06:59.065 --> 07:00.933
Oh, no. What happened?

07:01.000 --> 07:03.302
I... I got beat up.

07:03.369 --> 07:05.003
Sounds like you got a bully.

07:05.071 --> 07:07.473
Yeah! It's you!

07:07.540 --> 07:09.241
Hmm? Not sure what
you're talking about.

07:09.309 --> 07:10.542
I had a bully once.

07:10.610 --> 07:12.544
Stelio Kontos was his name.

07:12.612 --> 07:15.314
He was as mean as he was Greek.

07:15.381 --> 07:18.784
<i>He made my life a
living hell.</i>

07:18.852 --> 07:20.986
<i>He totally tormented me.</i>

07:21.054 --> 07:22.688
<i>One time he made me</i>

07:22.756 --> 07:24.923
<i>keep a live bat</i> <i>in my underpants
all day.</i>

07:24.991 --> 07:26.692
<i>Gave me ass rabies.</i>

07:26.760 --> 07:28.727
<i>My anus was frothing</i> <i>like a cappuccino.</i>

07:30.563 --> 07:33.132
Anyway, that olive-skinned
bastard made me

07:33.199 --> 07:34.800
into the man I am today.

07:34.868 --> 07:36.568
The kind that bullies his own son?

07:36.636 --> 07:38.904
Right. You see, Steve,
the good thing about bullies is

07:38.972 --> 07:40.239
they don't just go away.

07:40.306 --> 07:41.740
You're forced to deal with them.

07:41.808 --> 07:43.108
How did you deal with Stelio?

07:43.176 --> 07:44.343
Mm, good story.

07:44.410 --> 07:45.544
He moved away.

07:46.846 --> 07:48.280
But your bully's
not going anywhere.

07:48.348 --> 07:49.448
So deal with him.

07:49.516 --> 07:51.383
You'll be better off for it.

07:53.486 --> 07:54.553
Steve!

07:54.621 --> 07:55.888
Oh, my God!

07:55.955 --> 07:58.624
Who did this to you?!

07:58.691 --> 08:01.360
You better not say a word,
or I'll kill you!

08:02.362 --> 08:03.695
It was not Dad.

08:03.763 --> 08:05.397
Okay, it wasn't Dad.

08:05.465 --> 08:07.466
Good. We're narrowing it down.

08:07.534 --> 08:09.668
Who else can we cross off the list?

08:09.736 --> 08:12.171
I don't think you'd
do this to yourself.

08:12.238 --> 08:13.505
That's two.

08:13.573 --> 08:15.474
I know I didn't do it.

08:15.542 --> 08:18.110
This is coming together.

08:22.315 --> 08:24.116
Aah! I sprained my wrist!

08:24.184 --> 08:25.284
You don't know that.

08:25.351 --> 08:26.451
You're not a doctor.

08:26.519 --> 08:27.686
I'm taking this.

08:27.754 --> 08:29.288
What are you gonna do about it?

08:29.355 --> 08:31.089
I... I-I don't know.

08:31.157 --> 08:32.957
Stand up for yourself. Fight me!

08:34.360 --> 08:36.628
Well, I'm gonna mount
this and ride it hard...

08:36.696 --> 08:39.097
like I did your mom last night.

08:40.533 --> 08:42.900
♪ ♪

08:47.540 --> 08:49.441
Sorry.

08:49.509 --> 08:50.943
Oh, come on, man.

08:51.010 --> 08:52.611
You got to let me on.

08:52.679 --> 08:54.813
I'm trying to create a
moment with this girl.

08:54.881 --> 08:56.181
I respect this bitch.

08:56.249 --> 08:57.850
I <i>love</i> this bitch.

08:57.917 --> 09:00.018
Oh, I'm a sucker for love.

09:00.086 --> 09:01.720
Wrap your arms around that bitch,

09:01.788 --> 09:03.655
never let her go.

09:05.859 --> 09:07.092
Come on, baby.

09:07.160 --> 09:08.994
Our chariot awaits.

09:10.063 --> 09:12.931
Hayley?

09:12.999 --> 09:14.299
Jeff?

09:14.367 --> 09:16.368
Hey! I thought that was you.

09:16.436 --> 09:17.536
You look awesome, babe.

09:17.604 --> 09:18.937
Oh, you look great, too.

09:19.005 --> 09:20.539
I thought you were in Jerusalem

09:20.607 --> 09:21.940
trying to track down the inventor

09:22.008 --> 09:23.408
of the Everything Bagel.

09:23.476 --> 09:26.378
I was, but I got this job
offer selling glow things,

09:26.446 --> 09:29.548
and, you know, that's like a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

09:29.616 --> 09:31.583
God, it's so good to see you.

09:31.651 --> 09:33.151
You, too.

09:35.488 --> 09:37.623
Oh, sorry. Reginald, this is Jeff.

09:37.690 --> 09:39.658
We-We used to date.

09:39.726 --> 09:41.593
Oh. Well, that is so fun.

09:41.661 --> 09:43.028
Nice to meet you.

09:43.096 --> 09:45.564
Hey, you guys want to see
where all the clowns sleep?

09:45.632 --> 09:46.832
It's super sad.

09:46.900 --> 09:48.133
Yeah, sure.

09:48.201 --> 09:51.136
Oh, but we were about to
go on the Ferris Wheel.

09:51.204 --> 09:53.472
Oh, that's okay. You two go ahead.

09:53.539 --> 09:54.973
I'm gonna eat a whole turkey leg,

09:55.041 --> 09:56.909
then find a clean Port-a-John
to <i>destroy.</i>

09:56.976 --> 09:58.510
You're the best.

09:58.578 --> 10:00.445
You smell great. Thanks.

10:00.513 --> 10:02.147
How's Yerhujeva Gina?

10:02.215 --> 10:03.882
Oh, Yerhujeva? She's good.

10:03.950 --> 10:05.684
She's back in Croatia
for the winter

10:05.752 --> 10:07.419
with the rest of the Gina family.

10:07.487 --> 10:11.189
Upstaged by a wiley-ass hippie.

10:17.430 --> 10:18.830
Ugh, these shots are no good

10:18.898 --> 10:20.832
for my crime scene portfolio.

10:20.900 --> 10:22.601
If only you were a
little more mangled.

10:22.669 --> 10:24.469
Ooh, Steve, my wedding ring

10:24.537 --> 10:26.838
fell in the garbage disposal.
Grab it for me?

10:26.906 --> 10:29.007
Roger!

10:29.075 --> 10:30.542
You never do anything for me.

10:30.610 --> 10:33.045
Is there anything better
than night tennis?

10:33.112 --> 10:35.047
Yeah, a racially pure Europe.

10:37.617 --> 10:39.718
Steve, look at you!

10:39.786 --> 10:42.321
This bully thing is out of control!

10:42.388 --> 10:44.022
Steve should stand up to his bully.

10:44.090 --> 10:46.258
Violence is never the answer.

10:46.326 --> 10:48.961
Steve, have you tried
reasoning with this boy?

10:49.028 --> 10:51.463
Maybe he just needs a friend.

10:53.399 --> 10:55.067
Hey, Francine,
I dropped my bracelet

10:55.134 --> 10:56.335
in the garbage disposal.

10:56.402 --> 10:58.036
Dip your fingers in there for me?

10:58.104 --> 10:59.404
Roger!

10:59.472 --> 11:01.840
Come on, that was your
left hand, drama queen.

11:03.142 --> 11:05.143
Where am I off to?

11:08.915 --> 11:10.782
Give me your lunch money,
ass breath.

11:10.850 --> 11:12.617
I was thinking maybe
I could take you out

11:12.685 --> 11:13.885
for a cup of coffee.

11:13.953 --> 11:15.153
You know, talk a little?

11:16.756 --> 11:18.724
It's just, my dad
left when I was young.

11:18.791 --> 11:20.092
It was hard on my mom.

11:20.159 --> 11:21.426
It was hard on me.

11:21.494 --> 11:22.594
Must have been rough.

11:22.662 --> 11:25.797
It was, Steve. It really was.

11:25.865 --> 11:26.999
Mmm. Delish.

11:27.066 --> 11:28.066
Want a sip?

11:28.134 --> 11:29.935
Oh, yes, please,
I would love some...

11:30.003 --> 11:31.970
You can't reason with a bully!

11:32.038 --> 11:34.539
Aah! You got it in my eye!

11:34.607 --> 11:35.941
I know, I know.

11:36.009 --> 11:37.275
That's what Mom said last night.

11:37.343 --> 11:38.610
That's right-
while I was doing her.

11:38.678 --> 11:39.845
Ba-boom!

11:41.714 --> 11:44.149
Principal Lewis,
we're so worried about Steve.

11:44.217 --> 11:46.084
Somebody's been bullying him.

11:46.152 --> 11:47.319
Who's doing this to you, son?

11:50.623 --> 11:53.125
You better not say a
word or I'll kill you.

11:53.192 --> 11:54.259
I won't tell!

11:54.327 --> 11:55.660
I'll never tell!

11:55.728 --> 11:57.129
All right, well,

11:57.196 --> 11:58.964
I guess we'll have to
review the security camera.

12:12.512 --> 12:14.112
Yeah, let's move

12:14.180 --> 12:15.480
right through this
section at double speed.

12:23.156 --> 12:25.323
Francine, we need
to go home and talk.

12:25.391 --> 12:28.160
I'm having an affair
with a homosexual giant.

12:29.796 --> 12:31.830
Stan, what are you doing at...

12:33.533 --> 12:36.234
You're Steve's bully?

12:36.302 --> 12:38.270
Oh, got to go to my
xylophone lesson.

12:41.374 --> 12:43.375
Good-bye, Steve.

12:46.879 --> 12:49.448
And hello, desk sandwich.

12:57.423 --> 12:58.757
Oh, !

13:00.726 --> 13:02.260
Stan, come bk here!

13:08.734 --> 13:11.770
Stan, get back here!

Steve, I know I said violence

but it has just become the answer.

14:14.734 --> 14:18.503
I'm going to teach you how
to kick your father's ass.

14:18.571 --> 14:20.772

14:29.659 --> 14:32.161
I been in a few fights in my day.

'Bout two hundo, maybe two-fitty.

14:40.737 --> 14:42.571

Yeah!

14:46.242 --> 14:48.377

14:48.445 --> 14:50.446

15:05.195 --> 15:07.663
You're just...
You're just terrible!

15:07.731 --> 15:09.865
You, you can't even make a fist!

15:13.570 --> 15:15.237
Mom, where are you going?

15:15.305 --> 15:17.006
I'm no good for you
right now, Steve.

15:17.073 --> 15:19.875
You are <i>so</i> frustrating.

15:21.211 --> 15:22.811
I'm gonna go down to SeaWorld,

15:22.879 --> 15:24.713

15:53.877 --> 15:55.878

sliced medium thin.

16:12.762 --> 16:15.531
How's that?

16:15.598 --> 16:17.366
A little bit thinner. You got it.

16:21.738 --> 16:23.539
A little under okay?

16:23.606 --> 16:25.808
I prefer under to over.

16:26.943 --> 16:27.943
Have a good one.

16:33.883 --> 16:35.317
Oh, come on!

16:35.385 --> 16:37.886
You can't have Roger dress
you up just to avoid me.

16:37.954 --> 16:39.955

16:40.023 --> 16:41.957
I was in the chair at 4:00 a.m.!

16:42.025 --> 16:43.292
There's no way around this, Steve.

16:43.359 --> 16:45.494
Sooner or later, you're
going to have to find a way

16:45.562 --> 16:47.196
to get those oranges up the stairs.

16:49.065 --> 16:50.432
Fine.

16:50.500 --> 16:52.534
Let's settle this once and for all.

16:52.602 --> 16:55.738

16:55.805 --> 16:58.540

got a bit overpopulated.

just us? Sorry, Reggie.

17:16.492 --> 17:18.093

17:18.161 --> 17:20.362

17:20.430 --> 17:21.696
Oh, mm-hmm.

17:21.765 --> 17:24.833
I need some time alone
to sort things out.

17:24.901 --> 17:27.736

much time as you...
