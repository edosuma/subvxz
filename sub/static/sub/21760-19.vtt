Lucky:
Aw, come on, Spot.

01:16.880 --> 01:18.580
This is gonna be cinch.

01:18.580 --> 01:21.000
-Don't say it.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.790
Don't say it!

01:33.670 --> 01:36.120
I'm very tired, Scorch,

01:36.120 --> 01:37.790
and I need my beauty sleep.

01:37.790 --> 01:40.210
See that no one disturbs me!

01:40.210 --> 01:42.080
Not a sound.

01:42.080 --> 01:44.750
I'm holding you
personally responsible.

01:46.710 --> 01:48.380
Good night.

01:55.580 --> 01:57.040
I don't know.

01:57.040 --> 01:58.920
Why do I have
to do this?!

01:58.920 --> 02:00.880
Oh, come on, Spot.

02:00.880 --> 02:02.540
We've all done it.

02:02.540 --> 02:04.250
You have to too.

02:04.250 --> 02:08.330
Yeah, every dog's
done a double-dog dare.

02:08.330 --> 02:12.750
And you're dare
is you got to sneak
into villa de Vil

02:12.750 --> 02:16.670
and take
the sleeping mask
off Cruella

02:16.670 --> 02:19.040
without waking her up.

02:20.620 --> 02:22.460
B-but I don't
want to do it.

02:22.460 --> 02:24.000
What if I make a noise?

02:24.000 --> 02:25.620
What if Scorch
catches me?

02:25.620 --> 02:27.040
What if Cruella wakes up?

02:27.040 --> 02:28.960
Think of the consequences!

02:28.960 --> 02:30.960
I could end up...

02:30.960 --> 02:33.080
and served
on a silver platter!

02:35.580 --> 02:37.040
Chicken?

02:38.710 --> 02:40.880
Hey, I am not a chicken.

02:40.880 --> 02:42.620
Then prove it.

02:43.920 --> 02:46.170
Cadpig:
Think of it
as a growth opportunity,

02:46.170 --> 02:49.120
a chance to go
where no poultry
has gone before.

02:50.120 --> 02:52.040
It's the only way, Spot,

02:52.040 --> 02:53.960
if you want
to be one of us.

02:54.960 --> 02:58.080
Double-dog dare,
double-dog dare.

02:58.080 --> 02:59.920
All right, all right!

02:59.920 --> 03:03.580
I'll do it!
I'll show you
I'm no chicken.

03:04.830 --> 03:06.620
Do you think
she'll be all right?

03:06.620 --> 03:08.120
Yeah, yeah.

03:09.170 --> 03:10.920
Hey, Cadpig,

03:10.920 --> 03:12.460
remember my
double

03:12.460 --> 03:14.790
Hmm, let's see.

03:14.790 --> 03:17.330
Oh, yeah!
Lucky dared you

03:17.330 --> 03:20.120
to hide the food from
that circus elephant.

03:20.120 --> 03:22.500
Yeah.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.750
What a dare!

03:40.750 --> 03:42.960
But nobody had
a double-dog dare

03:42.960 --> 03:45.120
as daring as mine.
Remember, Lucky?

04:09.210 --> 04:12.710
Yeah, that dog catcher

04:12.710 --> 04:16.080
caught a little
Cadpig comeuppance
that day.

04:16.080 --> 04:18.960
Yeah, that was
a good one.

04:18.960 --> 04:22.380
Hey, what was your
double

04:22.380 --> 04:25.380
Uh, um, well...

04:25.380 --> 04:28.460
Yeah, you double-dog dared us,

04:28.460 --> 04:30.580
but who double

04:30.580 --> 04:33.250
Uh, you know,
it was that time--

04:33.250 --> 04:35.210
Uh, you remember.

04:35.210 --> 04:37.750
Whoa, whoa, you mean

04:37.750 --> 04:39.880
you have never done
a double

04:39.880 --> 04:41.580
Oh, uh...

04:42.750 --> 04:44.040
No.

04:44.040 --> 04:46.790
Well, then
we'll have to come up

04:46.790 --> 04:49.380
with a double-dog dare
for you.

05:01.750 --> 05:03.210
-Spot!

05:03.210 --> 05:04.210
Huh?

05:06.460 --> 05:08.880
Spot, it's me, Lucky.

05:08.880 --> 05:10.920
What are you doing here?

05:12.250 --> 05:14.790
I'm here to help you
with your dare.

05:14.790 --> 05:16.960
You help me?

05:16.960 --> 05:18.380
B

05:18.380 --> 05:22.710
'Cause helping you
is my double-dog dare.

05:22.710 --> 05:26.380
Great!
You're not chicken
are you?

05:26.380 --> 05:27.960
Just come on.

05:37.210 --> 05:38.830
Puppies...

05:40.580 --> 05:43.750
Okay, Spot,
any time you're ready.

05:43.750 --> 05:46.710
Me? Ha!
What about you?

05:46.710 --> 05:49.330
Okay, okay, okay.

05:49.330 --> 05:51.960
I'll--
I'll give you a boost.

05:51.960 --> 05:54.670
Oh, thanks a lot.

05:54.670 --> 05:55.750
Alley-oop.

06:05.210 --> 06:06.670
Come on, Spot.

06:06.670 --> 06:07.670
You can do it.

06:21.790 --> 06:23.830
-Oh, spots, spots, spots.

06:39.040 --> 06:41.170
Hey, I got it.

06:41.170 --> 06:42.620
I got it!

06:42.620 --> 06:45.620
I know, now let's
get out of here!

06:51.830 --> 06:54.710
Lucky, push harder!

06:54.710 --> 06:57.290
I'm trying,
I'm trying.

06:58.790 --> 07:00.170
Uh-oh.

07:23.380 --> 07:24.710
Spot!

07:36.250 --> 07:37.620
Get in, Spot.

07:45.620 --> 07:48.750
Who is making
all that infernal racket?!

07:48.750 --> 07:51.710
Where's my mask?

07:51.710 --> 07:53.790
Scorch! Scorch!

07:53.790 --> 07:55.170
Oh, that does it.

07:55.170 --> 07:56.790
You have
forfeited your--

07:59.750 --> 08:01.620
Uh, what is with
all this water on the floor?

08:05.330 --> 08:08.710
Scorch,
what in blazes
is going on?

08:12.670 --> 08:13.540
Both: Ah!

08:13.540 --> 08:16.330
Cruella: Whoa! Whoa!

08:20.000 --> 08:23.170
Lucky, no dare
is worth all of this.

08:23.170 --> 08:24.750
Lucky:
Here we go again!

08:31.710 --> 08:35.000
Scorch, I am missing
my beauty sleep.

08:36.460 --> 08:38.210
Lucky, Lucky!

08:38.210 --> 08:39.830
I think we're in trouble.

08:39.830 --> 08:42.670
Really, no kidding, Spot.

08:42.670 --> 08:44.620
Where have you been
the last 10 minutes?

08:44.620 --> 08:46.420
Just help me think
of a strategy

08:46.420 --> 08:48.420
to stop the water level
from rising.

08:48.420 --> 08:50.080
But, Lucky, look!

08:56.460 --> 08:57.750
Ya'!

09:01.000 --> 09:03.040
Lucky, Scorch
is is trouble.

09:04.120 --> 09:05.670
Lucky?

09:05.670 --> 09:06.790
Help!

09:06.790 --> 09:08.920
Oh, my dear sweet
mother of Pearl.

09:08.920 --> 09:10.500
What do I do?
What do I do?

09:10.500 --> 09:11.830
What do I do?

09:23.670 --> 09:26.080
Thanks, Spot,
now come on.

09:26.080 --> 09:27.540
We've got the mask.

09:27.540 --> 09:29.120
Paddle us out of here.

09:29.120 --> 09:31.750
Mask? Who cares
about the mask?

09:31.750 --> 09:34.000
Scorch is about
to get sucked
down the drain!

09:42.670 --> 09:44.540
Spot, what are
you doing?

09:44.540 --> 09:46.880
Looks like I'm gonna
marinate myself

09:46.880 --> 09:49.290
with eight feet
of raging bath water

09:49.290 --> 09:51.380
to rescue
our ferret foe!

09:52.620 --> 09:54.620
Hurry, Spot.

10:11.420 --> 10:12.420
Spot?

10:13.880 --> 10:16.670
-Spot, you did it!

10:20.250 --> 10:22.750
Ow! Ooh, what in blazes is--

10:22.750 --> 10:25.960
Ah, the water main.

10:37.670 --> 10:40.080
I guess he's saying
thank you

10:40.080 --> 10:41.380
for saving his life?

10:41.380 --> 10:45.170
No, I think he's imagining me
as a chicken pot pie.

10:45.170 --> 10:48.580
Hey, look,
the water level's dropping.

10:48.580 --> 10:51.670
Then let's get out
of this indoor Bermuda triangle.

10:52.920 --> 10:54.330
There you are!

10:54.330 --> 10:56.540
You have some
explaining to do!

10:59.380 --> 11:02.380
Now that's a double-dog
dare for the books.

11:02.380 --> 11:05.000
They got it!
They got it!

11:05.000 --> 11:07.040
Yay!

11:07.040 --> 11:09.620
So, come on, give, give
how'd it go?

11:09.620 --> 11:12.460
Hmph, piece of cake.

11:12.460 --> 11:14.210
Oh, papa!

11:14.210 --> 11:17.540
Now you're ready for
the triple-dog dare!

11:17.540 --> 11:20.580
It is not the dare
that makes the dog.

11:20.580 --> 11:24.580
I had the dog inside
this chicken body all the time,

11:24.580 --> 11:27.460
and I just didn't know it.

11:27.460 --> 11:29.880
Hey, wait for us, Spot.

11:29.880 --> 11:32.460
-Spotty, wait!
-Spotty!

11:51.080 --> 11:52.880
And who said
the cheese channel

11:52.880 --> 11:54.620
couldn't handle
the classics?

11:56.120 --> 11:59.040
Stop crowding me,
girlfriend!

11:59.040 --> 12:01.380
Well, get back
on your own side!

12:01.380 --> 12:04.170
I wonder what's going on.

12:04.170 --> 12:06.000
I can't go anywhere
in this stall

12:06.000 --> 12:08.330
without bumping
into your bovine butt!

12:10.330 --> 12:12.000
It's so tragic--

12:12.000 --> 12:15.330
two long-time friends
bickering like this.

12:16.420 --> 12:18.750
You're not thinking
of getting involved,

12:18.750 --> 12:19.830
are you?!

12:19.830 --> 12:23.210
Spot, I'm hardly
the kind of dog

12:23.210 --> 12:26.040
who sticks her nose
in other folks business.

12:26.040 --> 12:27.710
Then why do
I have this feeling

12:27.710 --> 12:29.330
of impending disaster?

12:30.830 --> 12:33.960
Well, I guess I have
been hogging the stall
a bit.

12:33.960 --> 12:35.620
Well, me too.

12:35.620 --> 12:38.290
I guess I am
getting a little
broad in the bean.

12:39.710 --> 12:43.330
Ladies, I couldn't help
but hear you arguing.

12:43.330 --> 12:45.250
Actually,
we were just mak--

12:45.250 --> 12:47.120
Luckily,
I just found this book

12:47.120 --> 12:49.380
to help angry cattle
through their differences.

12:49.380 --> 12:52.380
It's called,
"Beef with a Beef."

12:52.380 --> 12:54.290
But, Cadpig,
we aren't even--

12:54.290 --> 12:56.120
Chapter one:

12:56.120 --> 12:58.210
"Open, frank communication."

12:58.210 --> 13:01.000
You need to be honest
and voice your complaints.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.210
I don't see how
this is gonna help.

13:03.210 --> 13:05.120
Don't hold back.

13:05.120 --> 13:07.170
Well, okay.

13:07.170 --> 13:09.080
I don't like the way

13:09.080 --> 13:11.000
Duchess hogs
the entire stall.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.290
What?!
Who you calling a hog?

13:13.290 --> 13:14.920
If I told you
to move your butt,

13:14.920 --> 13:16.380
you'd have
to make two trips.

13:16.380 --> 13:19.170
Good! Oh, very good!

13:19.170 --> 13:20.670
Since we're being honest,

13:20.670 --> 13:22.540
then you won't mind
if I say,

13:22.540 --> 13:24.880
you snore like
a broken snow blower!

13:24.880 --> 13:26.960
-Yeah!

13:26.960 --> 13:28.920
-That's it, girls!

13:28.920 --> 13:30.290
Keep sharing!

13:31.290 --> 13:32.710
Ooh, I'm gonna open up

13:32.710 --> 13:35.250
a big old can of ouch
on you, cowgirl.

13:50.210 --> 13:52.420
Maybe Anita's right.

13:52.420 --> 13:54.580
I have been
working too hard lately.

13:56.460 --> 13:58.250
Duchess:
Don't push me,
girlfriend.

13:58.250 --> 14:00.210
Princess:
I couldn't push your
hefty hide with a truck!

14:00.210 --> 14:02.920
-I know so.

14:02.920 --> 14:05.250
You keep your nose
out of my business!

14:05.250 --> 14:08.250
Well, you keep
your business
out of my nose!

14:08.250 --> 14:12.120
Hey, is your milk
as sour as your face?

14:12.120 --> 14:13.920
Nice work, Cadpig.

14:13.920 --> 14:15.960
I'm glad they're
still communicating

14:15.960 --> 14:17.210
-at 3 AM.!

14:17.210 --> 14:19.210
Chapter two:

14:19.210 --> 14:22.250
"What to do when
Chapter one fails."

14:27.250 --> 14:29.380
Good morning, mom.

14:29.380 --> 14:30.620
Well, what's good about it?

14:30.620 --> 14:32.960
I didn't get
a wink of sleep
last night!

14:35.620 --> 14:37.250
-Hey.
-Hey!

14:37.250 --> 14:39.670
Stop with the pushing!

14:39.670 --> 14:42.000
Quit hogging the kibble!

14:45.960 --> 14:48.170
Get that fly farm
away from me.

14:48.170 --> 14:49.960
Don't start with me.

14:49.960 --> 14:51.290
Courage, ladies!

14:51.290 --> 14:53.420
You're starting
to make real progress.

14:53.420 --> 14:57.080
So today we're moving on
to chapter three,

14:57.080 --> 14:58.750
"Guided imagery."

14:58.750 --> 15:04.000
Now let's all visualize
what would make us happy.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.170
Fine, then I'm gonna
visualize Duchess

15:07.170 --> 15:08.790
in a saddle factory!

15:08.790 --> 15:10.880
Oh, yeah,
then visualize this!

15:10.880 --> 15:12.040
I've had enough.

15:12.040 --> 15:13.620
I'm moving in
with the pups.

15:24.830 --> 15:27.380
Oh, thanks a lot!

15:27.380 --> 15:30.500
Now we got a snoring
cow in our loft!

15:30.500 --> 15:32.380
Progress is often painful.

15:32.380 --> 15:34.710
I'm never gonna
get any sleep.

15:34.710 --> 15:36.670
Maybe if
we rolled her over,

15:36.670 --> 15:38.290
she'd stop snoring.

15:38.290 --> 15:40.250
Lucky:
Good idea.

15:48.710 --> 15:50.210
-Ah!

15:52.750 --> 15:54.170
Princess: I thought
I threw you out.

15:54.170 --> 15:56.170
You didn't throw me out.

15:56.170 --> 15:58.210
-Duchess: I left!

15:58.210 --> 16:00.250
Oh, not again!

16:00.250 --> 16:01.920
Princess:
Oh, yeah, you left,

16:01.920 --> 16:03.500
but your smell
stayed behind.

16:03.500 --> 16:04.920
You got your nerve.

16:04.920 --> 16:06.080
What you smell
is your own breath

16:06.080 --> 16:07.830
blowing back
in your face!

16:17.250 --> 16:19.920
-Stop snoozing
in the kibble!

16:19.920 --> 16:21.620
Keep it down!

16:21.620 --> 16:24.460
I didn't get
any sleep last night!

16:24.460 --> 16:26.500
Well, neither
did anybody else!

16:32.080 --> 16:34.920
I think
last night we learned
that the hayloft

16:34.920 --> 16:38.290
is a dangerous place
for a cow, didn't we?

16:38.290 --> 16:41.830
So if we're going to learn
to live together,

16:41.830 --> 16:43.620
we're going
to have to learn
to respect

16:43.620 --> 16:45.250
one another's boundaries.

16:45.250 --> 16:48.040
There!
We've got the space.

16:48.040 --> 16:50.080
Now where's the respect?

16:51.330 --> 16:53.170
Duchess,
don't you have something

16:53.170 --> 16:55.210
you'd like to say
to Princess?

16:55.210 --> 16:56.290
Oh, yeah!

16:56.290 --> 16:58.500
Tell old baggage butt
to stop eating my hay!

16:58.500 --> 17:01.880
Your hay?!
This is my hay, girl!

17:06.120 --> 17:07.790
That's it, ladies.

17:07.790 --> 17:09.120
Express your anxieties!

17:15.960 --> 17:18.460
So the dairy queen
wants her space?

17:18.460 --> 17:19.460
Fine!

17:22.460 --> 17:26.170
From now on,
don't cross this line!

17:26.170 --> 17:28.330
And you keep
your mangy tail

17:28.330 --> 17:29.920
out of my half
of the barn!

17:37.000 --> 17:39.040
It says here, uh,

17:39.040 --> 17:40.830
that you should
express your convictions

17:40.830 --> 17:42.500
in a positive way.

17:42.500 --> 17:44.210
Put a cork in it,
puppy pants.

17:44.210 --> 17:45.580
This means war!

17:45.580 --> 17:47.920
W

17:50.250 --> 17:52.120
I thought we were
all getting better,

17:52.120 --> 17:53.580
not angrier.

17:59.080 --> 18:01.500
Hey, you're stepping
in my space.

18:01.500 --> 18:04.830
But I just
want to watch TV.

18:04.830 --> 18:06.290
Are you siding with her?

18:06.290 --> 18:08.170
Uh, yes.

18:08.170 --> 18:09.420
I mean no.

18:09.420 --> 18:11.000
I mean yes!

18:11.000 --> 18:13.170
-No, no! I mean--

18:13.170 --> 18:14.880
Ow! My head hurts.

18:16.040 --> 18:17.880
-Watch where you're walking!

18:17.880 --> 18:18.960
Uh, right.

18:31.080 --> 18:33.960
Hey, careful,
this is Duchess's space.

18:33.960 --> 18:35.380
Who are you with?

18:35.380 --> 18:36.920
Uh, Princess--

18:36.920 --> 18:38.000
I think.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.080
Then get back on her side!

18:40.080 --> 18:41.710
Don't push me!

18:41.710 --> 18:43.670
I'm with Princess!

18:43.670 --> 18:46.330
Cut it out!
I'm with Princess!

18:46.330 --> 18:49.460
I'll push you
if I want to, mister!

18:50.880 --> 18:52.540
-Wait!

18:52.540 --> 18:53.920
This isn't right.

18:53.920 --> 18:56.920
You need to communicate
your feelings openly

18:56.920 --> 18:58.960
and honestly!

18:58.960 --> 19:02.000
I honestly want
to push Lucky down!

19:13.040 --> 19:15.880
You sure do look a sight,

19:15.880 --> 19:18.880
-precious.
-You think that's
funny, daddy?

19:20.670 --> 19:22.580
Then don't
cross this line!

19:22.580 --> 19:24.460
The trough is mine!

19:27.330 --> 19:30.080
Well, if that's where
you're gonna be, fine,

19:30.080 --> 19:32.620
-then the mud hole is mine!

19:32.620 --> 19:33.960
But I'll send
you a sample...

19:36.040 --> 19:37.790
-by air mail!

19:40.460 --> 19:42.210
This is not going well!

19:42.210 --> 19:44.580
You need to
creatively visualize--

19:44.580 --> 19:46.290
Eat a rock, splotchy!

19:46.290 --> 19:47.920
We're busy!

19:49.920 --> 19:51.710
That's it!

19:51.710 --> 19:54.960
I'm siding with Dumpling!

19:54.960 --> 19:57.040
Well, I'm siding
with Ed the pig.

19:57.040 --> 19:58.960
I could be rasher,
but that' siding

19:58.960 --> 20:00.670
with the wrong bacon, honey.

20:00.670 --> 20:01.960
You're eggs
are scrambled!

20:01.960 --> 20:05.710
-You two should try
a trust exercise!

20:05.710 --> 20:07.920
Take a hike, dogzilla.

20:07.920 --> 20:09.710
This is bird business!

20:15.880 --> 20:17.290
This isn't right.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.960
What's everybody
fighting about!

20:27.790 --> 20:30.080
We're just expressing
our feelings!

20:30.080 --> 20:33.670
Yeah, we're being
honest and frank.

20:33.670 --> 20:36.880
No, this isn't
what I meant!

20:36.880 --> 20:40.500
-But you said--
-Forget what I said!

20:41.920 --> 20:45.460
Stop it!

20:52.960 --> 20:54.620
Are you all bonkers?

20:54.620 --> 20:57.710
This is supposed
to be conflict resolution,

20:57.710 --> 20:59.790
not a demolition derby!

20:59.790 --> 21:02.580
Listen, we just did
what you told us to do:

21:02.580 --> 21:06.000
visualize, conceptualize,
and pasteurize.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.920
All we really wanted
was more room in our stable.

21:08.920 --> 21:10.420
Then why don't you just

21:10.420 --> 21:12.330
open up
the side of your stall?

21:12.330 --> 21:15.080
Hun, works for me.

21:15.080 --> 21:17.790
Me too.
Thanks, Spot.

21:18.790 --> 21:20.290
Huh?

21:20.290 --> 21:21.830
So that was it?

21:21.830 --> 21:24.460
You turned the whole farm
into World War III

21:24.460 --> 21:27.330
and all it took
was open up
the stall?

21:27.330 --> 21:29.580
I supposed
it was effective

21:29.580 --> 21:32.170
in its own primitive
obvious way.

21:35.920 --> 21:38.380
Remember,
anger management

21:38.380 --> 21:40.540
is the key
to a healthy s--

21:40.540 --> 21:43.000
Manage this, Cadpig!
Get her!

21:49.920 --> 21:52.330
But I--

21:58.880 --> 22:00.920
Everybody's so
uptight around here.

22:00.920 --> 22:03.710
I am so glad
we are not like that.

22:03.710 --> 22:04.880
Hm-hm-hm.

22:04.880 --> 22:06.790
I can't imagine
carrying on like that, girl.
