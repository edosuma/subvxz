00:01.794 --> 00:04.546
Previously on 90210...

00:04.672 --> 00:05.339
VANESSA:
I'm sorry

00:05.464 --> 00:07.883
for the way that we first met.

00:08.007 --> 00:09.510
Hitting me with a car
was starting with a bang.

00:09.635 --> 00:11.094
You trust me now?

00:11.219 --> 00:12.721
Absolutely.

00:12.847 --> 00:14.598
What I was selling tonight
wasn't the Offshore,

00:14.723 --> 00:15.724
it was you.

00:15.850 --> 00:17.935
I'm glad everything is
resolved with your family,

00:18.059 --> 00:20.354
and I will always
care about you.

00:20.479 --> 00:22.731
But I can't just go back
to the way things were.

00:22.857 --> 00:24.817
I am trying to get
back to a normal life.

00:24.942 --> 00:26.276
And I've been getting
the inheritance checks,

00:26.401 --> 00:27.862
so money's not a problem now.

00:27.987 --> 00:29.822
Good.

00:29.947 --> 00:31.072
Nick called,
and he spoke to Sonia Reese

00:31.198 --> 00:32.448
about me, as in

00:32.573 --> 00:34.702
the Sonia Reese Gallery
downtown.

00:34.827 --> 00:36.453
You hauled your entire
portfolio down here.

00:36.578 --> 00:38.038
It's your best work, right?

00:38.163 --> 00:39.456
Might as well look at it.

00:40.833 --> 00:42.626
Oh!
Is everything
okay here?

00:42.751 --> 00:44.169
(retches)

00:44.294 --> 00:46.296
You're fired, Naomi.

00:46.421 --> 00:48.549
Mitchell sobered up after
a bit, and we actually
had a pretty good time.

00:48.674 --> 00:51.010
He was very impressed with the
event and the event planner.

00:51.134 --> 00:52.594
This is huge, Holly.

00:52.720 --> 00:55.347
I... I mean, maybe I could start
my own business or something.

♪ ♪

01:02.646 --> 01:03.731
NAOMI:
Now, since your new restaurant

01:03.856 --> 01:05.733
is Cuban themed,

01:05.858 --> 01:08.109
we'll start by covering
the entire floor with sand.

01:08.235 --> 01:10.278
A beachy theme,
I like that.

01:10.404 --> 01:13.323
We'll get some traditional
music going, and then, voila.

01:13.448 --> 01:14.950
You've transported your
guests back to Cuba

01:15.075 --> 01:16.785
in the 1950's.

01:16.911 --> 01:18.037
You know, before that crazy guy

01:18.161 --> 01:18.913
messed everything up
for everyone.

01:19.038 --> 01:20.706
Sounds great.

01:20.831 --> 01:23.291
Just get me your budget
and a list of references.

01:23.417 --> 01:25.920
Um, references?

01:26.045 --> 01:28.547
Well, I don't have
references per se,

01:28.672 --> 01:29.882
but I have thrown hundreds
of parties.

01:30.007 --> 01:31.341
For...

01:31.466 --> 01:32.968
Myself, mostly.

01:33.092 --> 01:36.597
You can ask anyone-- a Naomi
Clark party is not to be missed.

01:36.722 --> 01:38.933
Naomi, I'm sorry,
but I wouldn't feel right

01:39.058 --> 01:42.269
leaving it to someone
without professional experience.

01:42.394 --> 01:44.813
I'm gonna have to pass.

01:51.570 --> 01:52.696
LIAM:
So, Sheila,

01:52.821 --> 01:54.782
while I really appreciate
everything that you've done

01:54.907 --> 01:56.951
for me-- you know, the watch
ads, the billboards--

01:57.076 --> 01:59.119
I was, uh,

01:59.244 --> 02:01.121
kind of thinking we could take
things to the next level.

02:01.246 --> 02:03.164
Aw, Liam, I'm married.

02:03.290 --> 02:04.666
And gay.

02:04.792 --> 02:07.711
I meant the next
level of my career.

02:07.836 --> 02:09.964
You know, things have been
going great, but, you know,

02:10.089 --> 02:12.340
nothing lasts
forever, and, uh...

02:12.466 --> 02:14.927
Well, I was kind of thinking

02:15.052 --> 02:16.804
I could break into
television and film.

02:16.929 --> 02:19.640
Right, um, well, Liam, you know,

02:19.765 --> 02:23.310
the transition from model
to actor can be kind of tricky.

02:23.435 --> 02:26.688
And, um, quite frankly,
not everyone is cut out for TV.

02:26.814 --> 02:28.774
Oh, Liam is.

02:28.899 --> 02:30.985
I mean, he's got star quality.

02:31.110 --> 02:31.986
I'm sorry, and you are?

02:32.111 --> 02:33.654
This is Vanessa.

02:33.779 --> 02:35.530
She's my girlfriend.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.407
I see.

02:37.532 --> 02:39.242
Well, Liam, you know,

02:39.367 --> 02:40.577
if you're serious,
we could start

02:40.702 --> 02:41.662
by getting you
a national commercial.

02:41.787 --> 02:43.580
And you could get
into some acting classes.

02:43.705 --> 02:45.206
And, you know,

02:45.332 --> 02:46.875
who knows, maybe in a year
or so...

02:47.001 --> 02:48.752
A year?

02:48.877 --> 02:50.087
Are-Are you kidding me?

02:50.211 --> 02:51.296
That's just wasting time.

02:51.421 --> 02:53.381
Liam's ready now.

02:53.507 --> 02:56.551
Darling, if Liam goes out there
before he's ready

02:56.677 --> 02:58.428
it would be career suicide.

02:58.553 --> 02:59.930
Just let me do my job.

03:00.055 --> 03:03.809
Which is what, cashing checks
while he busts his ass for you?

03:03.934 --> 03:07.729
Sorry, I just call
it like I see it.

03:07.855 --> 03:08.814
And how do you see it, Liam?

03:08.939 --> 03:12.151
Well, I think Vanessa's
got some great ideas.

03:12.275 --> 03:13.360
All right, you know what?

03:13.485 --> 03:15.445
The girlfriend steps in,
I step out.

03:15.570 --> 03:17.156
Good luck on your
next endeavor, Liam.

03:17.280 --> 03:19.158
You're going to need it.

03:19.282 --> 03:21.493
Okay, wait, Sheila.

03:21.618 --> 03:22.744
You know what?

03:22.870 --> 03:24.913
No, we are better
off without her.

03:25.039 --> 03:27.624
We can do this on our own.

03:27.749 --> 03:29.751
We're fine.

03:37.467 --> 03:39.469
So, how many
fliers did you print

03:39.594 --> 03:40.220
for this gallery opening?

03:40.345 --> 03:42.139
Like a thousand of them.

03:42.263 --> 03:44.016
Dude, I'm so excited.

03:44.141 --> 03:45.350
You've turned into
this cool artist chick

03:45.475 --> 03:46.434
right in front of our eyes.

03:46.560 --> 03:47.394
Whoa!

03:47.519 --> 03:47.853
Buddy!
Whoa!

03:47.978 --> 03:48.812
Hey!

03:48.937 --> 03:51.106
Rude!

03:54.026 --> 03:57.154
(sighing)

03:57.278 --> 03:58.697
I'm so sorry.

03:58.822 --> 04:00.908
Those guys, uh, they can get a
little out of control sometimes,

04:01.033 --> 04:02.534
you know?

04:02.659 --> 04:04.119
Yeah, no, it-it's all good.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.413
Um, I dig

04:06.538 --> 04:07.539
that design on your board.

04:07.664 --> 04:09.875
I don't know if you're
into art at all,

04:10.000 --> 04:11.210
but I'm having a gallery
opening; maybe you want to come?

04:11.334 --> 04:13.879
Yeah, no, I'm into art.

04:14.004 --> 04:17.298
Just, uh, not so much the crap
that rich people buy

04:17.423 --> 04:19.218
to feel better about themselves.

04:19.341 --> 04:20.635
Anyway, uh, sorry about
the dust-up, yeah?

04:24.347 --> 04:26.183
Jerk.

04:26.307 --> 04:28.643
Um, yo, I'm gonna go
hand the rest of these
out at the Offshore,

04:28.769 --> 04:30.187
but I'll catch
you guys in a bit.

04:30.311 --> 04:32.981
I'm so jealous of Ivy.

04:33.107 --> 04:35.316
She found something that she's
really passionate about.

04:35.442 --> 04:37.694
Meanwhile, I haven't done a
single good thing with my life.

04:37.819 --> 04:39.320
Come on, that is not true.

04:39.446 --> 04:40.614
Silver,

04:40.739 --> 04:42.407
I was basically a hooker.

04:42.532 --> 04:44.451
I-I was too self-absorbed
to even notice

04:44.576 --> 04:46.036
that Dixon had a drug problem.

04:46.161 --> 04:48.413
And I almost got him framed
for arson and thrown in jail.

04:48.538 --> 04:50.874
Yeah, all right, it's
been a rough year.

04:50.999 --> 04:53.334
Uh, just stop
concentrating on the past.

04:53.460 --> 04:55.045
Think about the future.

04:55.170 --> 04:58.048
Mm-hmm. Does that wisdom apply
to you and Navid?

04:58.173 --> 05:00.341
'Cause you know the truth about
Amal now, and you're single.

05:00.467 --> 05:01.426
No, it's different.

05:01.551 --> 05:03.386
It's complicated.

05:03.511 --> 05:04.638
We got a lot of baggage.

05:04.763 --> 05:05.973
Which is in the past.

05:06.098 --> 05:08.850
You love Navid, right?

05:08.976 --> 05:10.727
Yes.

05:10.852 --> 05:13.438
Well, everybody knows that,
except for him.

05:13.563 --> 05:16.191
You have to let him know
how you feel.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.026
Maybe you're right.

05:18.152 --> 05:19.945
Ha. Look at that.

05:20.070 --> 05:21.655
I just did some good
with my life.

but I didn't know you
actually got accepted.

07:24.778 --> 07:25.737
I thought you deferred.

Oh, yeah, things have
been crazy with my family,

07:28.156 --> 07:30.367
so I couldn't go, but the
university called last week

07:30.491 --> 07:32.035

had an opening.

psyched, man.
You have no idea.

You're going Ivy League,

You said you had
something to tell me?

Hey.

08:25.255 --> 08:26.340
Ooh, quick question.

08:26.465 --> 08:28.049
Do I look drunk in this picture,
or like I'm throwing

08:28.175 --> 08:29.801
a fabulous party
for a client?

08:29.926 --> 08:31.303
Since your earrings are
made of potato chips,

08:31.428 --> 08:32.011
I'm going to go with drunk.

08:32.136 --> 08:33.888
What are you doing?

08:34.014 --> 08:35.640
I'm trying to put together
a fake portfolio.

08:35.765 --> 08:37.725
Apparently, you have
to get paid to throw a party

08:37.851 --> 08:39.311
before you actually have
party planning experience.

08:39.436 --> 08:41.145
Why are you so dressed up?

08:41.270 --> 08:43.606
I just had the most
amazing meeting.

08:43.731 --> 08:45.608
I've been trying to figure out
what to do with my life

08:45.733 --> 08:48.403
since I have all
this money now, you know?

08:48.528 --> 08:50.780
And then it hit me,
charity work!

08:50.905 --> 08:53.908
So I started at the top--
The Hillingsbrook Foundation.

08:54.034 --> 08:56.536
The Hillingsbrook Foundation.
Well, that's impressive.

08:56.661 --> 08:58.621
How much did you write
the check for?

08:58.746 --> 09:00.999
I want to do more
than just write a check!

09:01.124 --> 09:02.417
This Preston Hillingsbrook guy,

09:02.542 --> 09:05.670
I mean, he wasn't there,
but he is so inspiring.

09:05.795 --> 09:07.506
He's really making a difference
in the world, you know?

09:07.630 --> 09:11.843
So I volunteered to work at his
benefit to save Castillo Bay.

09:11.968 --> 09:14.929
That's a lot of excitement
for a little charity work.

09:15.055 --> 09:16.931
One of my jobs is to wrangle
celebrity guests for the event.

09:17.057 --> 09:19.559
You remember the guy who puked
on you a couple weeks ago?

09:19.684 --> 09:22.479
Mitchell Nash?
How could I forget?

09:22.603 --> 09:23.563
Yeah, do you think he'd help?

09:23.688 --> 09:25.773
Are you serious?

09:25.899 --> 09:28.151
Okay, Mitchell Nash
is not exactly charity material.

09:28.276 --> 09:30.028
He's an insane partier.

09:30.153 --> 09:32.280
Oh, my God,
he's an insane partier.

09:32.406 --> 09:34.115
He throws a lot of parties.

09:34.241 --> 09:35.283
Holly gave me his number.

09:35.409 --> 09:36.701
He can be my first client!

09:36.826 --> 09:39.704
But I still need people
for my charity event.

09:39.829 --> 09:42.665
Try Liam; he's a semi-celeb.
I got to run.

09:42.790 --> 09:46.294
♪ ♪

09:46.420 --> 09:47.837
Hey.

09:47.962 --> 09:49.714
Hey, I just came by
to drop this off

09:49.839 --> 09:51.007
to Liam before I take off.

09:51.132 --> 09:53.134
So you're going.
Are you so excited?

09:53.260 --> 09:54.719
Are you kidding me?
Princeton?

09:54.844 --> 09:58.265
Ah, it's a great opportunity.

09:58.390 --> 09:59.849
Hugely excited.

09:59.974 --> 10:03.437
Okay, I know when you're
excited, and this is not it.

10:03.562 --> 10:04.645
Come on, Navid, it's me.

10:04.771 --> 10:06.731
Okay, look...

10:06.856 --> 10:08.816
as great as, uh,
Princeton sounds,

10:08.942 --> 10:11.486
I was kind of hoping Silver
would ask me to stay.

10:11.611 --> 10:14.531
Or at least be sad to see me go,
but she isn't.

10:15.698 --> 10:18.410
Ah, I'll get over
it eventually, right?

10:18.535 --> 10:20.870
(chuckles) I guess she'll be
the one that got away.

10:20.995 --> 10:23.915
You're such a romantic.

10:24.040 --> 10:25.792
I wish some of that
would rub off on Dixon.

10:25.917 --> 10:26.918
What do you mean?

10:27.043 --> 10:29.337
(sighs)
I don't know.

10:29.463 --> 10:30.964
I mean, ever since we
started working together,

10:31.089 --> 10:33.425
it's like it's sucked the
passion from our relationship.

10:33.550 --> 10:35.552
No, you two are great together.

10:35.676 --> 10:36.928
You'll figure it out.

10:37.053 --> 10:39.222
Well, maybe you and Silver
will figure it out, too.

10:39.347 --> 10:41.933
I don't see that happening.

10:42.058 --> 10:44.018
I'm out of here in two days.

10:45.686 --> 10:47.855
I'll let you get back to work.

10:47.981 --> 10:50.191
Yeah.

10:51.526 --> 10:53.403
I hit up Rodeo Drive.

10:53.528 --> 10:54.613
Got you a ton of stuff.

10:54.737 --> 10:56.990
I mean, if you're going
to be a movie star,

10:57.115 --> 10:59.909
you got to start
dressing like one.

11:00.034 --> 11:01.536
Yeah, well, I hope
you kept the receipt,

11:01.661 --> 11:03.330
because I've been calling
casting agents all morning

11:03.455 --> 11:04.998
and I can't even get through.

11:05.123 --> 11:06.541
The best I got was an invitation

11:06.666 --> 11:08.168
to Annie's charity as
a celebrity guest.

11:08.293 --> 11:09.210
Oh, a charity?

11:09.336 --> 11:10.504
That's perfect.

11:10.629 --> 11:12.339
It'll give you something
to talk about

11:12.464 --> 11:14.508
when you're on Your Day L.A.

11:14.633 --> 11:16.675
Wait a minute.

11:16.801 --> 11:17.927
You booked me a talk show?

11:18.052 --> 11:19.262
(laughs)

11:19.387 --> 11:20.679
How did you swing that?

11:20.805 --> 11:23.558
Okay, so one of the
producers comes in here

11:23.682 --> 11:26.685
for our happy hour,
and I hit him up,

11:26.811 --> 11:29.439
and he said yes, 'cause
there was a cancelation.

11:29.564 --> 11:30.482
Oh.

11:30.607 --> 11:32.192
(laughing):
Isn't that amazing?

11:32.317 --> 11:34.194
Yeah, that's-that's fantastic.

11:34.319 --> 11:35.487
(sighs)

11:35.612 --> 11:37.071
But you... you heard
what Sheila said.

11:37.197 --> 11:39.032
Do you think I'm ready
for a talk show?

11:39.157 --> 11:41.284
It's talking.

11:41.409 --> 11:43.411
You're talking
to me right now.

11:43.537 --> 11:48.583
Look, once Hollywood
sees how amazing you are,

11:48.707 --> 11:51.461
they're gonna be
knocking down our door.

11:55.173 --> 11:57.592
I believe in you.

11:57.716 --> 11:59.760
You just have to
believe in yourself.

11:59.886 --> 12:01.804
Mm.

12:01.929 --> 12:02.639
ANNIE:
Thanks again

12:02.763 --> 12:05.183
for donating a photo
to the silent auction.

12:05.308 --> 12:07.185
Are you kidding me?
Annie, it's my pleasure.

12:07.310 --> 12:08.978
Sonia already picked which
ones she wants to hang,

12:09.103 --> 12:10.980
so you get your
pick of the rest.

12:11.105 --> 12:13.400
Someone is gonna be so lucky
to get their own Ivy Sullivan

12:13.525 --> 12:15.902
before you get crazy famous.
Shut up.

12:16.986 --> 12:20.865
IVY: Oh, my God, who would
do something like this?

12:22.909 --> 12:24.952
(sighs)

12:34.003 --> 12:37.507
Mitchell Nash,
what a surprise!

12:37.632 --> 12:40.635
Just so we're on
the same page,

12:40.759 --> 12:42.637
I remember very little

12:42.761 --> 12:44.013
about last night.

12:44.138 --> 12:46.558
Did we hook up?

12:46.683 --> 12:47.975
Oh, God, no!

12:48.101 --> 12:49.394
No. I'm Naomi Clark.

12:49.519 --> 12:50.437
I escorted you down
the red carpet

12:50.562 --> 12:52.230
at that event
a couple weeks ago?

12:52.355 --> 12:54.941
Naomi...

12:55.066 --> 12:56.610
Of course,
I remember you.

12:56.735 --> 12:57.694
Did we hook up?

12:57.818 --> 13:01.864
Believe me, if we hooked up,
you'd remember.

13:01.989 --> 13:04.284
Sorry, love. I can't
hear you over the bubbles.

13:04.409 --> 13:05.826
(sighs)

13:09.830 --> 13:11.541
Listen, I hear you
have a movie opening,

13:11.666 --> 13:15.754
and it's so coincidental
because I actually decided

13:15.878 --> 13:16.837
to start my own
event planning company.

13:16.963 --> 13:18.423
Really?

13:18.548 --> 13:21.050
Yes. You could be
my first client.

13:21.175 --> 13:23.261
I will throw you
a movie premier bash

13:23.386 --> 13:25.012
that will make
the Academy Awards look like

13:25.138 --> 13:26.473
a knitting circle.

13:26.598 --> 13:28.349
That actually
sounds fantastic.

13:28.475 --> 13:29.559
Not a premier party--

13:29.684 --> 13:31.269
I hate those things--
but I have

13:31.394 --> 13:32.979
something a little more personal
in mind.

13:33.104 --> 13:35.482
I'm not sleeping
with you, Mitchell.

13:35.607 --> 13:37.984
I meant, what I need
is a birthday party...

13:38.109 --> 13:41.237
for my daughter.

13:41.362 --> 13:43.030
I wasn't aware
you had a daughter.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.658
Neither was I.

13:44.783 --> 13:47.076
But DNA tests confirmed it,
so, here we are.

13:47.201 --> 13:48.453
Anyway,

13:48.578 --> 13:51.122
she's turning 16, and I thought,

13:51.247 --> 13:53.583
what better way to show her
what a great dad I am

13:53.708 --> 13:55.209
than throwing her
the most amazing party

13:55.335 --> 13:56.919
this town has ever seen?

13:57.044 --> 13:58.296
Like a sweet-16 party?

13:58.421 --> 13:59.464
Exactly.

14:01.800 --> 14:04.218
I just want
to put a smile on her face.

14:04.344 --> 14:07.430
I can't seem to make her happy.

14:07.555 --> 14:10.016
You do that,
and I'll throw you more business

14:10.141 --> 14:12.143
than a prostitute has
on New Year's Eve.

14:12.268 --> 14:15.229
Well, I will make her
the happiest little princess

14:15.355 --> 14:16.314
on the planet.

14:16.439 --> 14:17.774
Excellent.

14:17.898 --> 14:20.109
Oh, here's my
angel now.

14:20.234 --> 14:23.112
Carla!

14:23.237 --> 14:24.947
This is Naomi.

14:25.072 --> 14:26.991
She's going to be throwing you
a sweet-16 party.

14:27.116 --> 14:29.619
What's up, bitch?

14:41.130 --> 14:45.885
(sighs) We found a window in the
back where they broke in.

14:46.010 --> 14:48.012
Obviously, the opening
will have to be cancelled.

14:48.137 --> 14:49.639
Unbelievable.

14:49.764 --> 14:51.891
Whoever did this could
be an amazing artist,

14:52.016 --> 14:54.644
but this is how they choose
to express themselves.

14:54.769 --> 14:55.770
Such a shame.

14:55.895 --> 14:58.105
Oh.

14:59.357 --> 15:01.192
I'm so sorry
about your show.

15:02.985 --> 15:06.072
Yeah, well, I guess this art
just isn't for everybody.

15:11.244 --> 15:13.246
NAOMI: Um, how about
this for a theme?

15:13.371 --> 15:14.455
Arabian Nights.

15:14.581 --> 15:15.665
We'll rent an enormous tent,

15:15.790 --> 15:17.792
you can ride in on
a giant white stallion.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.043
Pass.

15:19.168 --> 15:22.004
Um, okay.
Mardi Gras?

15:22.129 --> 15:24.298
Psychedelic '60s?

15:24.424 --> 15:26.050
Glam Rock '70s?

15:26.175 --> 15:28.010
No, no, and hell, no.
That stuff is so not me.

15:28.135 --> 15:29.763
Well, I am sorry.

15:29.888 --> 15:31.138
I'm not throwing a
vampire-themed party,

15:31.264 --> 15:33.808
because that is too overdone!

15:33.933 --> 15:36.477
Look, I'm just trying

15:36.603 --> 15:38.438
to get my business
off the ground.

15:38.563 --> 15:41.107
Okay? Your dad said
you can have anything you want.

15:41.232 --> 15:43.777
Will you just work with me
and tell me what that is?

15:43.902 --> 15:45.570
I don't want a party.

15:45.695 --> 15:47.530
What do you mean,
you don't want a party?

15:47.655 --> 15:49.449
Everyone wants a party
when they're turning 16.

15:49.574 --> 15:51.200
Look, I just moved here, okay?

15:51.325 --> 15:53.453
I don't... know anyone.

15:53.578 --> 15:56.539
Oh, my God.

15:58.416 --> 15:59.751
Oh, honey, I totally get it.

15:59.876 --> 16:01.335
You're afraid
no one's gonna show up.

16:01.461 --> 16:03.797
No.
Carla, if you want

16:03.922 --> 16:04.798
to make friends,
this is how you do it.

16:04.923 --> 16:06.674
You throw a fantastic party,
everyone has a blast,

16:06.800 --> 16:08.259
and by the end of the night,
you're all BFFs.

16:08.384 --> 16:10.428
When I was your age, I was
doing this on a weekly basis.

16:10.553 --> 16:12.012
Really?

16:12.138 --> 16:14.056
Yes, really. It's how
you make a name for yourself.

16:14.181 --> 16:16.183
Leave it all to me.
By the time

16:16.309 --> 16:18.060
the party is over, my business
will be off the ground,

16:18.185 --> 16:20.605
and you will be the most popular
girl at high school, guaranteed.

16:29.029 --> 16:30.156
(clears throat)

16:30.281 --> 16:31.365
Hey, how you feeling?

16:31.491 --> 16:32.700
Hey. Good, good, good.

16:32.826 --> 16:34.994
Hey, I was thinking, uh,
maybe I should tell a joke,

16:35.119 --> 16:36.621
or something-- you
know, like, um...

16:36.746 --> 16:38.665
Or maybe do my Brando
impression, huh, you know?

16:38.790 --> 16:41.292
Oh, Vanessa, when you
came into my life...

16:41.417 --> 16:43.252
Okay, you're gonna be fine.

16:43.377 --> 16:45.505
All right? Just be yourself.

16:45.630 --> 16:47.214
Not the self
that does impressions.

16:47.340 --> 16:49.425
Okay, come on.
We got to go.

16:49.550 --> 16:52.011
Well, uh, whoa,
what is this?

16:52.136 --> 16:53.262
You're in the cooking
segment now.

16:53.387 --> 16:54.889
Cooking?

16:55.014 --> 16:57.183
No, no, no, no,
I don't cook. I don't cook.

16:57.308 --> 16:58.977
I'm just supposed to talk.
Only thing I've ever cooked

16:59.101 --> 17:01.437
is Thanksgiving dinner, which
I ordered from a restaurant.

17:01.562 --> 17:03.063
Tell that story.
That's a funny story.

17:03.189 --> 17:04.482
(sighs)

17:04.607 --> 17:07.276
MAN:
And five, four, three, two...

17:07.401 --> 17:08.694
Okay, people,

17:08.819 --> 17:11.196
you may recognize him
from his billboard

17:11.321 --> 17:13.199
and print ads across the city.

17:13.324 --> 17:16.368
Ladies and gentlemen...
Liam Court!

17:16.493 --> 17:19.789
(applause, theme music plays)

17:20.832 --> 17:23.376
So nice to meet you, Liam.

17:23.501 --> 17:25.252
(whispers):
Okay. There we go.

17:25.377 --> 17:27.714
Hi.
(giggles nervously)

17:27.839 --> 17:29.674
Of course, we have to make sure
we have the right person.

17:29.799 --> 17:32.886
Can you take your shirt off?
Are you serious?

17:33.011 --> 17:34.094
No, I'm kidding!

17:34.220 --> 17:35.346
(both laugh)

17:35.471 --> 17:39.475
So, today, we're making
Szechuan Crispy Fish.

17:39.600 --> 17:42.395
And we start
with three whole rockfish.

17:42.520 --> 17:44.939
Oh, um, hey,
speaking of fish,

17:45.105 --> 17:47.775
I-I wanted to, um,
mention this charity event

17:47.901 --> 17:48.860
that I'm attending
tomorrow night

17:48.985 --> 17:49.694
to save Castillo Bay.

17:49.819 --> 17:51.905
See, sometimes, if a
bay becomes polluted,

17:52.030 --> 17:55.115
uh, there's a lot of dead
and diseased fish, and...

17:55.241 --> 17:57.493
Not that these fish
are diseased,

17:57.618 --> 17:58.995
but just seeing them made me...

17:59.119 --> 18:01.664
think of... that.

18:01.789 --> 18:04.375
Okay. Well...

18:04.500 --> 18:05.752
we are going to cover

18:05.877 --> 18:08.337
these very healthy
and fresh fish...

18:08.462 --> 18:10.965
(sighs)
...with this
scallion marinade,

18:11.090 --> 18:14.010
and then top it off with this
tangy sweet and sour sauce.

Well, you work with

28:41.845 --> 28:43.138
Oh, that would be great.

Wilson, okay, tell us

28:50.563 --> 28:52.356
about your charity.
Thank you.

28:52.481 --> 28:54.567
Yes, uh, well we are here
to raise money

28:54.692 --> 28:56.151

28:56.276 --> 28:57.819
It's one of the jewels
of our coastline,

28:57.944 --> 28:59.905

Foundation we think

29:00.030 --> 29:02.658
it's very important to try
and take care of our planet.

money on this event

say to the fact

29:10.749 --> 29:12.626

has historically been

29:12.751 --> 29:14.253

polluters in the state?

Oh, well, I don't think
that could be true.

I swear to God, if you're here
