00:43.176 --> 00:45.167
Are you there?

00:45.378 --> 00:46.709
I'm here.

00:46.880 --> 00:50.179
Help me.
My client is going to jail.

00:50.250 --> 00:52.241
Oh, no, she's not.

00:52.318 --> 00:53.785
I think I've got it.

00:53.853 --> 00:55.912
Really?

00:55.989 --> 00:58.480
Look up Hasson v. Conrad.

00:58.558 --> 01:00.355
Similar circumstantial
evidence...

01:00.427 --> 01:02.088
case was thrown out.

01:02.162 --> 01:04.357
Legaleagle, thank you.

01:04.431 --> 01:06.956
You are by far
the most brilliant mind

01:07.033 --> 01:08.466
in this chat room.

01:08.535 --> 01:10.298
Thank you, Lawyer-girl.

01:10.370 --> 01:14.067
I realize we have
certain anonymity here,

01:14.140 --> 01:16.973
but do you, by any chance,
have a name?

01:19.079 --> 01:20.979
It's Charlene.

01:35.361 --> 01:37.659
I missed you yesterday.

01:39.566 --> 01:41.761
How was your day?

01:41.835 --> 01:43.200
Uneventful.

01:43.269 --> 01:45.499
I exercised for an hour
in the morning,

01:45.572 --> 01:47.938
poked around in the yard
in the afternoon,

01:48.007 --> 01:51.408
and visited with a girlfriend
down the block in the evening.

01:51.478 --> 01:53.139
Sounds innocent enough.

01:53.213 --> 01:55.681
Don't let my humdrum day
fool you, now.

01:55.748 --> 01:58.512
I also have a very dark side.

02:13.900 --> 02:15.561
Well, I'm 31

02:15.635 --> 02:18.866
with long, flowing locks
and an athletic body.

02:18.938 --> 02:20.701
Peter, what do you look like?

02:25.478 --> 02:30.472
I'm... a little older...
6'2".

02:30.550 --> 02:34.077
My hair is...
it's light.

02:34.154 --> 02:36.748
Uh, it's boyishly light.

02:39.659 --> 02:43.789
And good night to you,
Lawyer-girl.

03:26.172 --> 03:28.436
Gendler.

03:32.979 --> 03:34.640
- Good morning, Mr. Sanderson.
- Hi.

03:34.714 --> 03:35.806
Morning, Peter.

03:35.882 --> 03:37.042
How are you?

03:40.186 --> 03:41.551
Gentlemen.

03:41.621 --> 03:43.953
Oh, good. Peter's here.
We can begin.

03:44.023 --> 03:46.253
Okay.
On to pressing business.

03:46.326 --> 03:47.588
Word has come to us

03:47.660 --> 03:50.629
that coffee heiress
Mrs. Virginia Arness

03:50.697 --> 03:52.892
has dismissed
her current tax lawyers.

03:52.966 --> 03:54.593
Virginia Arness.

03:54.667 --> 03:57.363
74 years old, born and raised
in Athens, Georgia.

03:57.437 --> 03:58.529
At the age of 13,

03:58.605 --> 04:00.539
she was shipped off to
boarding school in England,

04:00.607 --> 04:02.768
where she's been residing
until just recently.

04:02.842 --> 04:04.639
That was only two days ago.

04:04.711 --> 04:06.178
Impressive.

04:06.246 --> 04:07.941
Now, we've all heard

04:08.014 --> 04:11.950
that Mrs. Arness has
a penchant for thriftiness.

04:12.018 --> 04:15.283
And that she brings new meaning
to the term "conservative."

04:15.355 --> 04:17.619
It's not going to be easy.

04:17.690 --> 04:20.214
She's paranoid
and suspicious. Peter...

04:20.293 --> 04:21.521
I'm her guy.

04:21.594 --> 04:24.222
I'm single.
I'll give her nights, weekends.

04:24.297 --> 04:25.889
Aren't you getting married
on Sunday, Todd?

04:25.965 --> 04:27.728
That's flexible.

04:27.800 --> 04:30.234
And, Peter, I wouldn't
want this to interfere

04:30.303 --> 04:32.294
with your family's
Hawaiian vacation.

04:32.372 --> 04:33.805
You go on.

04:33.873 --> 04:35.500
I got it all taken care of.

04:36.776 --> 04:37.868
<i>Mahalo.</i>

04:40.146 --> 04:42.137
Well, that's very admirable
of you, Todd.

04:42.215 --> 04:45.241
I mean, your youth
definitely makes you an ass...

04:46.653 --> 04:48.382
...et to the company,

04:48.454 --> 04:50.888
especially at the annual
softball game.

04:50.957 --> 04:54.393
But to an archconservative,
74-year-old woman?

04:55.461 --> 04:58.726
What will we do is not charge
Mrs. Arness one single red cent

04:58.798 --> 05:00.163
for her estate planning.

05:01.367 --> 05:02.356
Why?

05:02.435 --> 05:04.562
Because we don't care
about that measly fee.

05:04.637 --> 05:07.197
We use it as a loss leader
to get her corporate business,

05:07.273 --> 05:11.403
the multibillion-dollar
Arness coffee conglomerate.

05:16.416 --> 05:17.576
Hmm.

05:28.761 --> 05:30.956
How may I help you, Howie?

05:31.030 --> 05:33.430
Just thought I'd congratulate
you on turning it around.

05:33.499 --> 05:35.364
Turning what around?

05:35.435 --> 05:37.096
You snaked Gendler.

05:37.170 --> 05:39.604
Please.
Gendler doesn't bother me.

05:40.873 --> 05:43.171
Oh, that's right.
He doesn't bother you.

05:43.242 --> 05:45.233
What the heck was I thinking?

05:46.446 --> 05:48.175
Listen, I thought
maybe after work

05:48.247 --> 05:49.771
you and me go tie one on,

05:49.849 --> 05:51.874
maybe check out
some of the local talent.

05:51.951 --> 05:54.010
Can't. I'm meeting
Mrs. Arness at 6:00.

05:54.087 --> 05:56.248
And by the way,
it's "You and I go tie one on,"

05:56.322 --> 05:57.584
not "You and me go."

05:57.657 --> 05:59.318
Somebody messaging you here.

05:59.392 --> 06:00.586
Who's Lawyer-girl?

06:02.395 --> 06:03.589
Nobody.

06:03.663 --> 06:06.757
Whoa. Did someone make
a blind Internet date?

06:06.833 --> 06:09.199
No. I mean, you know,
well, technically, but no.

06:09.268 --> 06:11.964
I met her
in a legal chat room.

06:12.038 --> 06:14.563
She's, uh, very classy
and smart.

06:14.640 --> 06:15.971
When do you nail her?

06:16.042 --> 06:17.600
I'm courting her tonight
at 7:00.

06:17.677 --> 06:19.838
Oh, jeez. You're courting her.
Sounds like a hot one.

06:19.912 --> 06:21.004
And this is her?

06:21.080 --> 06:22.604
Yeah, she's attractive,
isn't she?

06:22.682 --> 06:24.240
I suppose.
It's not my cup of tea.

06:24.317 --> 06:27.013
What do you...
she is universally cute.

06:27.086 --> 06:29.145
Eh, she's a little too
anemic-Iooking, Petey.

06:29.222 --> 06:31.918
I like my jello to jiggle,
if I'm not being too subtle.

06:31.991 --> 06:33.481
You're not being too subtle.

06:33.559 --> 06:36.824
All right, as long as she spins
your knobs, I'm happy for you.

06:38.231 --> 06:40.756
Have you nailed anyone
since Kate?

06:40.833 --> 06:42.664
Nail... I was
supposed to call her.

06:42.735 --> 06:45.033
Sofia, can you get my wife
on the phone?

06:45.104 --> 06:46.503
- Ex-wife.
- Ex-wife on the phone?

06:46.572 --> 06:47.596
Right away.

06:47.673 --> 06:50.198
Can't help you with this one,
pal. See you later.

06:52.512 --> 06:55.174
Peter, you cannot break
another promise to these kids.

06:55.248 --> 06:56.510
You just can't.

06:56.582 --> 06:58.345
I said I couldn't take them
to Hawaii.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.045
I didn't say
I couldn't take them.

07:00.119 --> 07:01.643
They can spend the week
with me.

07:01.721 --> 07:04.315
They are gonna be
so disappointed.

07:04.390 --> 07:05.948
I can't talk to you right now.

07:13.466 --> 07:16.526
Um... Daddy can't take you
to Hawaii.

07:16.602 --> 07:19.070
Oh, darn.

07:19.138 --> 07:20.901
He always does this.

07:25.945 --> 07:27.708
Sanderson, party of two.

07:27.780 --> 07:29.611
Oh, you're the last
to arrive.

07:29.682 --> 07:31.172
How long has she been here?

07:31.250 --> 07:32.877
Mmm, about 20 minutes.

07:32.952 --> 07:34.510
Was she trouble?

07:39.258 --> 07:40.953
Thank you.

07:41.027 --> 07:43.495
Hello.
I'm Peter Sanderson.

07:45.398 --> 07:48.697
Well, I'm glad
they didn't send a child.

07:48.768 --> 07:52.204
I told them I specifically
wanted someone my own age.

07:57.410 --> 07:59.310
What a wonderful
French bulldog.

07:59.378 --> 08:01.903
My mother had one.
They make great companions.

08:01.981 --> 08:03.949
What's her name?

08:04.016 --> 08:09.215
His name is
William Shakespeare.

08:09.288 --> 08:10.846
Well, of course.

08:12.291 --> 08:15.522
Now, I've heard about
your unfortunate escapade.

08:15.595 --> 08:17.995
I don't have escapades.

08:18.064 --> 08:20.999
Fiasco with your
previous attorney.

08:21.067 --> 08:23.331
The man was
a thieving criminal.

08:23.402 --> 08:25.666
Just because I have
a lot of money

08:25.738 --> 08:28.571
doesn't give people
the right to overcharge.

08:28.641 --> 08:31.872
I do not enjoy
being taken advantage of.

08:31.944 --> 08:34.879
Which is why our service
is free of charge.

08:34.947 --> 08:36.972
After all, you worked hard
for your money.

08:37.049 --> 08:38.482
I'm an heiress.

08:38.551 --> 08:43.318
An heiress who worked hard
to keep her money.

08:45.391 --> 08:47.222
Now, shall we get down
to business?

08:47.293 --> 08:48.419
Fine.

08:48.494 --> 08:50.792
So, now you may hand over
your proposal.

08:50.863 --> 08:52.558
I'll take it with me.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.365
Proposal?

08:55.434 --> 08:57.994
Well, I was expecting
to meet with you tomorrow.

08:58.070 --> 09:01.198
I was assured
the proposal would be ready

09:01.274 --> 09:02.468
for this afternoon.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.806
I see no point
in our meeting tomorrow.

09:04.877 --> 09:07.402
Excuse me.
Madam, I'm sorry.

09:07.480 --> 09:10.506
We have a no-dog policy
in the lounge.

09:10.583 --> 09:13.484
Unfortunately, I'm gonna have
to ask you to remove the dog.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.453
Excuse me.
I am Mrs. Arness' attorney,

09:15.521 --> 09:17.751
and because there is no sign
posted regarding dogs,

09:17.823 --> 09:20.223
that means there is
no policy toward dogs.

09:20.293 --> 09:22.386
Now, if you want to avoid
a legal situation,

09:22.461 --> 09:24.326
I would suggest
you run to the kitchen

09:24.397 --> 09:26.763
and get some tuna tartare
for William Shakespeare

09:26.832 --> 09:28.629
on the house.

09:28.701 --> 09:29.963
Yes, sir.

09:30.036 --> 09:31.663
I'm terribly sorry, ma'am.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.606
Where and when tomorrow?

09:52.491 --> 09:53.924
Hello, Mr. Sanderson.

09:53.993 --> 09:56.291
Oh, Mrs. Kline.
Always a pleasure.

09:56.362 --> 09:58.557
And when am I going to
get to babysit

09:58.631 --> 10:00.963
with your charming
little Georgey again?

10:02.468 --> 10:04.026
Oh, uh, well, uh, soon,

10:04.103 --> 10:06.936
because he just loves
coming over to your place.

10:08.240 --> 10:10.640
Uh, Mr. Sanderson?

10:10.710 --> 10:14.908
Those Latin people
who were skulking around...

10:14.981 --> 10:18.974
Oh. They were looking
at the Aruda house.

10:19.051 --> 10:20.951
Casing it?

10:21.020 --> 10:23.147
No, uh, to buy it.

10:23.222 --> 10:25.383
Oh, please.

10:25.458 --> 10:28.825
If they're in this block and not
carrying a leaf blower...

10:28.894 --> 10:30.327
Yeah.

10:30.396 --> 10:32.455
Well, I'd love to discuss this
with you further,

10:32.531 --> 10:33.998
but I'm expecting someone.

10:34.066 --> 10:35.658
Ohh.

11:41.333 --> 11:42.391
Yeah.

11:42.468 --> 11:43.730
Hey.

11:54.046 --> 11:55.513
Hi.

12:28.948 --> 12:30.438
Yeah.

13:02.348 --> 13:04.373
I hope you like cham...

13:08.721 --> 13:09.983
...poo.

13:11.056 --> 13:12.353
What's up, baby?

13:12.424 --> 13:14.654
Ooh, champagne.
I love champagne.

13:14.727 --> 13:15.716
This for me?

13:15.795 --> 13:18.320
Oh, I'm sorry. I think
you have the wrong house.

13:18.397 --> 13:20.331
It is damn good
to finally connect.

13:20.399 --> 13:22.026
Pardon me?

13:22.101 --> 13:24.501
It's me, fool... Charlene.

13:24.570 --> 13:25.969
Ooh, food.

13:26.038 --> 13:27.164
What?

13:27.239 --> 13:30.003
It's me, honey.
Your date... Lawyer-girl.

13:30.075 --> 13:31.064
You can't be.

13:31.143 --> 13:32.667
Hey, hey, hey.
Leave that alone.

13:32.745 --> 13:33.769
Well, why can't I?

13:33.846 --> 13:35.905
Because you're not a blonde.

13:35.981 --> 13:37.744
Can't get nothing past you.

13:38.918 --> 13:40.681
You must be
a bomb-ass lawyer.

13:40.753 --> 13:43.051
Oh, look at all
of these pretty candles...

13:43.122 --> 13:45.955
all romantic and shit.

13:46.025 --> 13:49.119
Somebody was planning
on getting some booty tonight.

13:49.195 --> 13:51.163
Hey! Leave that alone.
There are settings.

13:51.230 --> 13:54.393
And you can't be Charlene,
because Charlene is more of...

13:54.466 --> 13:55.558
Skinny white broad?

13:55.634 --> 13:56.566
Yeah.

13:56.635 --> 13:58.728
You know, I get that a lot.

13:58.804 --> 14:00.897
But that's your fault
you're thinking that, bro.

14:00.973 --> 14:03.737
You must have not have took
a good look at that picture.

14:03.809 --> 14:05.777
I have looked
at that picture a lot,

14:05.845 --> 14:07.608
and trust me,
you are not in it.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.272
Mm-hmm.

14:18.557 --> 14:20.752
Move, move, move.
Let me do it.

14:20.826 --> 14:22.453
See?

14:25.564 --> 14:26.622
There I am.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.725
Sorry you got it
twisted, dog.

14:29.802 --> 14:32.100
I don't get a lot of
photo ops where I been.

14:33.973 --> 14:35.600
Where exactly have you been?

14:35.674 --> 14:38.768
I got a rumble in the jungle.
We still having dinner or what?

14:38.844 --> 14:40.334
I asked you a question.

14:40.412 --> 14:41.538
Rolex.

14:41.614 --> 14:42.774
Rolex?

14:42.848 --> 14:45.009
I did time, baby,
but I ain't do the crime.

14:45.084 --> 14:46.813
You're a convict?

14:46.886 --> 14:48.012
Bump that.

14:48.087 --> 14:49.952
Shoot,
Roscoe cracked that door.

14:50.022 --> 14:51.956
I kicked it off the heezy
and bounced.

14:52.024 --> 14:53.116
For real, though.

14:54.126 --> 14:56.253
What did you just say?

14:56.328 --> 14:58.262
What, don't you hear good?

14:59.665 --> 15:00.757
All right.

15:00.833 --> 15:03.358
Let's see.
How can I put this?

15:03.435 --> 15:06.302
I was recently liberated
from a correctional facility...

15:06.372 --> 15:07.703
All right. I get it.

15:07.773 --> 15:10.537
You're in the big house, and
you get someone to type for you,

15:10.609 --> 15:13.305
and you get on the Internet,
and you misrepresent yourself.

15:13.379 --> 15:14.607
It happens, and I'm a sucker,

15:14.680 --> 15:16.773
but now you have to go,
because this is over.

15:16.849 --> 15:18.339
Unh-unh. No, no, no.

15:18.417 --> 15:20.385
Biscuit,
you misrepresented yourself.

15:20.452 --> 15:22.283
Boyishly light... please.

15:22.354 --> 15:23.321
Gray.

15:23.389 --> 15:25.789
You said you was
a criminal lawyer.

15:25.858 --> 15:26.916
I pulled your file.

15:26.992 --> 15:29.187
You're just some sorry-ass
tax attorney.

15:29.261 --> 15:31.195
A tax lawyer is
a criminal lawyer.

15:31.263 --> 15:33.288
Oh, yeah?

15:33.365 --> 15:35.765
Well, good,
'cause that's why I'm here.

15:35.834 --> 15:37.267
Well, do tell.

15:37.336 --> 15:40.328
Well,
I want to reopen my case.

15:40.406 --> 15:44.706
And what did you do, smoke
some homies on a drive-by?

15:45.711 --> 15:47.542
Smoke? Homies?

15:47.613 --> 15:49.672
Well, you a regular
gangster, huh?

15:50.649 --> 15:54.176
No, man. I was in for armed
robbery, but I didn't do it.

15:54.253 --> 15:55.345
Yeah, nobody did it.

15:55.421 --> 15:57.218
I can't be having
this conversation

15:57.289 --> 15:58.449
because you're a criminal-type.

15:58.524 --> 16:00.458
If I was a criminal,
I would have shanked you

16:00.526 --> 16:01.959
when I had
that knife in my hand.

16:02.027 --> 16:04.359
The fact that you even said that
is a problem for me.

16:04.430 --> 16:06.398
- But I didn't think that.
- It's just time to go.

16:06.465 --> 16:08.956
Please, just listen to me.
Just give me one second.

16:09.034 --> 16:10.126
No, I don't have a second.

16:10.202 --> 16:12.329
Okay, can I just
say something, please?

16:12.404 --> 16:13.336
What?

16:13.405 --> 16:15.236
I didn't do the crime.

16:15.307 --> 16:17.002
You rude mother...

16:19.311 --> 16:20.801
I ain't goin'.

16:44.503 --> 16:48.633
It's your baby,
Peter, and don't you deny it!

16:48.707 --> 16:51.369
That DNA test told on you!

16:51.443 --> 16:53.468
You lie, Peter!

16:53.545 --> 16:55.877
You know lil' Kareem is yours!

16:56.982 --> 16:58.142
Why?!

16:58.217 --> 17:00.082
How you gonna do me
like that, Peter?!

17:00.152 --> 17:04.555
You told me I was your
beautiful African Queen.

17:04.623 --> 17:07.147
And I loved you
for that, Peter!

17:07.226 --> 17:09.217
I didn't care if your
little thing was curved.

17:10.695 --> 17:13.096
And lil' Kareem don't want
your child support.

17:13.165 --> 17:17.124
He just want a relationship
with his white daddy.

17:18.737 --> 17:20.704
A little
chocolate/vanilla swirl

17:20.772 --> 17:23.173
from that magical night
at the crackhouse.

17:23.242 --> 17:23.833
Oh!

17:25.544 --> 17:28.012
Come on.
Just be quiet!

17:28.079 --> 17:30.310
Wait just a second.
My shoes.

17:30.382 --> 17:32.009
- Mr. Sanderson?
- Whoa!

17:32.084 --> 17:33.312
Is everything okay?

17:33.385 --> 17:35.785
I thought I heard Negro.

17:35.854 --> 17:39.517
No. No Negro spoken here.

17:39.591 --> 17:41.650
Oh.

17:41.727 --> 17:44.696
Well... good night, then.

17:44.763 --> 17:46.958
Oh, uh...

17:47.032 --> 17:48.397
good night.

17:53.105 --> 17:54.265
Come on!

17:54.339 --> 17:56.000
Come on, come on!

17:59.411 --> 18:02.107
You stay. You stay.
You wait right there.

18:02.181 --> 18:04.149
Who you callin'?

18:04.216 --> 18:05.979
The police.

18:07.753 --> 18:10.221
Police department.
Sergeant Panella. Please hold.

18:10.289 --> 18:11.449
What's that?

18:11.523 --> 18:13.013
It's all of our e-mails.

18:13.092 --> 18:15.026
You think anybody at Tobias,
Kline, and Barnes

18:15.094 --> 18:16.686
would be interested
in hearing

18:16.762 --> 18:19.322
about you looking for Boom-boom
in the federal pen?

18:20.365 --> 18:22.026
And I'll send a photo.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.625
Thanks for holding.
Can I help you?

18:28.440 --> 18:31.568
Now, this is just
for tonight, understand?

18:35.747 --> 18:37.715
A'ight.

18:37.783 --> 18:40.047
I can work with this.

18:40.119 --> 18:42.246
But, uh, look,
don't be gettin' no ideas

18:42.321 --> 18:44.755
about sneakin' up in here
and hittin' this ass,

18:44.823 --> 18:47.417
'cause you blew your chance
with this fine sister.

18:47.493 --> 18:49.723
Dare to dream.

18:49.795 --> 18:51.888
Tsk. Please.

18:56.101 --> 18:58.365
Oh, my God! A bed!

18:58.437 --> 19:01.235
Oh, a nice, big, cushy bed.

19:01.306 --> 19:03.900
Ohh, no roommates,
no cellmates.

19:21.293 --> 19:22.624
Charlene?

19:24.329 --> 19:25.796
Charlene.

19:28.934 --> 19:31.596
Charlene! Come on,
you're not fooling anybody.

19:32.871 --> 19:35.101
Who that? Who there?

19:35.174 --> 19:36.937
Who want it with Lene?

19:38.377 --> 19:40.277
I put some bagels outside.

19:40.345 --> 19:42.745
I thought
we could discuss your case.

19:44.016 --> 19:45.540
Ahh!

19:45.617 --> 19:47.551
What up, dog?
Where 'em bagels at?

19:47.619 --> 19:50.179
Hey, guess what, girlfriend?
Your game is up.

19:50.255 --> 19:51.847
Because I burned
all those e-mails,

19:51.924 --> 19:54.449
including the second set hidden
in the lining of your coat.

19:54.526 --> 19:56.721
And I deleted everything
off my computer.

19:56.795 --> 19:59.787
So I never met you,
and you never met me.

19:59.865 --> 20:03.232
Don't even try, girlfriend,
because it's locked.

20:03.302 --> 20:07.762
And now I am going to go
get my kids,

20:07.839 --> 20:09.272
as in innocent young persons

20:09.341 --> 20:11.309
who will never even know
you were here.

20:11.376 --> 20:12.741
So now just go.

20:12.811 --> 20:15.211
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go!

20:15.280 --> 20:16.838
And locky locky!

20:16.915 --> 20:17.939
So ta-ta.

20:18.016 --> 20:20.109
And watch out.
The gate closes automatically.

20:20.185 --> 20:21.209
Well, what about my stuff?

20:21.286 --> 20:23.083
Oh, it's right there
on the street.

20:23.155 --> 20:24.782
You put my stuff
on the trash?

20:24.856 --> 20:26.824
Oh. Well, you know what?

20:26.892 --> 20:28.416
I wish you well.
I really do.

20:28.493 --> 20:30.688
And you know what?
I had a great, great time.

20:30.762 --> 20:31.820
It was really fun.

20:31.897 --> 20:33.194
So, oh, well.

20:33.265 --> 20:35.233
I guess I'll just see you
in my next life.

20:35.300 --> 20:37.325
Heh heh heh heh. Bye!

20:39.671 --> 20:42.162
Ha ha. I'll see you
when you get home.

20:47.980 --> 20:49.777
So I said to him,

20:49.848 --> 20:52.180
"Just 'cause you whisked me
to Paris on your private jet

20:52.251 --> 20:54.378
doesn't mean
I'm gonna sleep with you."

20:54.453 --> 20:56.284
What does he think I am?
A hooker?

20:56.355 --> 20:59.950
Can Aunt Ashley
edit herself, please?

21:00.025 --> 21:02.220
You stayed in
the same room with him.

21:02.294 --> 21:03.386
What did you expect?

21:03.462 --> 21:05.828
Hello. It was a suite...
plenty of floor space.

21:05.897 --> 21:08.024
Sweetiepie, have a wonderful
time. I love you.

21:08.100 --> 21:10.796
Please be good to your brother
and help him with his reading.

21:10.869 --> 21:12.166
- I will.
- Thank you.

21:12.237 --> 21:15.070
Is he still having problems?

21:15.140 --> 21:18.075
Oh, he struggles every day,
but he's improving.

21:18.143 --> 21:20.407
Dad's here.

21:20.479 --> 21:22.674
Thank you, sweetiepie.

21:22.748 --> 21:24.215
Don't worry, sweetie.

21:24.283 --> 21:26.877
Daddy's stupid, too,
and he became a lawyer.

21:26.952 --> 21:27.884
Ashley!

21:27.953 --> 21:29.215
I'm not stupid.

21:29.288 --> 21:31.051
- That's right.
- No, no, no. Of course not.

21:31.123 --> 21:32.181
Hey, Dad's here.

21:32.257 --> 21:34.248
Speak of the dummy.

21:34.326 --> 21:36.351
Hey, how's my little girl
doin', huh?

21:36.428 --> 21:37.656
Hi, Dad.

21:37.729 --> 21:39.162
Hey, how's it goin', big guy?

21:39.231 --> 21:40.698
Ahhh, here you go.

21:41.566 --> 21:43.056
Hi, Kate.

21:44.236 --> 21:45.168
Hi.

21:45.237 --> 21:47.899
Oh, Ashley, I didn't realize
you were gonna be here.

21:47.973 --> 21:49.235
What a pleasant surprise.

21:49.308 --> 21:52.072
Peter,
you're almost aging well.

21:52.144 --> 21:55.272
Okay, I thought we'd go down
to the club and take a swim.

21:55.347 --> 21:57.713
Ooh, that sounds
much more fun than Maui.

21:57.783 --> 21:59.910
You know, Ashley,
not all of us earn our living

21:59.985 --> 22:02.112
by milking rich geriatrics
out of their money.

22:02.187 --> 22:03.916
Some of us have to work
for a living.

22:03.989 --> 22:07.083
You sound much more intelligent
with your mouth shut.

22:07.159 --> 22:08.854
Let's not start this.
I don't have time.

22:08.927 --> 22:10.588
Kids, go get your stuff.

22:10.662 --> 22:11.856
All right, fine.

22:11.930 --> 22:13.488
But I warned you

22:13.565 --> 22:16.898
about marrying the first
jerk-off you met out of college.

22:16.968 --> 22:18.959
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a date.

22:19.037 --> 22:20.971
<i>Don't</i> be good.

22:21.973 --> 22:24.407
What morgue did you find
this one at?

22:24.476 --> 22:26.569
Stop being so childish.

22:31.450 --> 22:32.974
Hey.

22:33.985 --> 22:35.919
Wow.
You look beautiful.

22:35.987 --> 22:37.079
Thank you.

22:37.155 --> 22:39.146
Mmm.

22:39.224 --> 22:41.249
Uh, hi.

22:41.326 --> 22:43.317
Uh, Peter, this is Glen.

22:44.396 --> 22:45.454
Hey.

22:45.530 --> 22:47.828
Hey, Mr. Sanderson.
Nice to see you.

22:47.899 --> 22:49.230
Yeah, nice to meet you.

22:49.301 --> 22:52.862
Uh, what do you say
we get this road on the show?

22:52.938 --> 22:53.996
Okay.

22:55.173 --> 22:56.265
I will meet you outside.

22:56.341 --> 22:57.672
Okay.

22:57.743 --> 22:58.675
Road on the show.

22:58.744 --> 23:00.507
Just don't.

23:00.579 --> 23:01.944
How old is he?

23:02.013 --> 23:03.310
Younger.

23:03.382 --> 23:04.906
- What does he do?
- Golf instructor.

23:04.983 --> 23:06.473
- How do you know that?
- What?

23:06.551 --> 23:08.109
Well, you think
you know somebody,

23:08.186 --> 23:10.654
and then one day you wake up
in Thailand missing a kidney.

23:10.722 --> 23:14.123
He could have made up
this whole golf identity.

23:14.192 --> 23:16.752
He caddied for you
when he was 14.

23:17.829 --> 23:19.990
That's little Glenny?

23:21.400 --> 23:22.958
Does that bother you?

23:23.034 --> 23:24.126
Not at all.

23:24.202 --> 23:26.932
Go have fun
on your statutory weekend.

23:30.942 --> 23:33.740
This does too bother you.
I know you.

23:34.913 --> 23:36.505
Do you want to talk
about it?

23:36.581 --> 23:38.549
Well, it just looks
a little silly.

23:38.617 --> 23:40.551
Hang on.

23:40.619 --> 23:41.711
Hello?

23:41.787 --> 23:44.779
Some things never change.

23:44.856 --> 23:47.120
I can't talk right now.

23:47.192 --> 23:49.251
Well, put him on.

23:49.327 --> 23:50.624
Hi.

23:50.695 --> 23:53.289
You promised us
you'd take us snorkeling.

23:53.365 --> 23:55.094
Things come up.
That's life.

23:55.167 --> 23:57.294
I know.
I'm really, really sorry.

23:57.369 --> 24:00.304
But now it's over. It's new.
We're gonna have a lot of fun.

24:00.372 --> 24:03.102
Now, what's new?
What's new with you?

24:03.175 --> 24:07.305
Well, I got the female lead
in the school play "Oklahoma!"

24:08.313 --> 24:10.338
Hey, that's great.
Congratulations.

24:10.415 --> 24:12.383
And how 'bout you, big guy?
How's school?

24:12.451 --> 24:13.884
I don't like school.

24:13.952 --> 24:15.283
Well, nobody likes school,

24:15.353 --> 24:17.753
but there must be something
you like about it.

24:17.823 --> 24:20.121
He got into a fight
the other day.

24:20.192 --> 24:22.524
Why?
Why'd you get in a fight?

24:22.594 --> 24:26.792
Some kids called me a baby
'cause of the way I read.

24:26.865 --> 24:29.800
Some of the greatest minds of
all time had trouble learning,

24:29.868 --> 24:34.601
like Edgar Allan Poe
and Albert Einstein

24:34.673 --> 24:36.197
and, uh, Ozzy Osbourne.

24:37.409 --> 24:38.774
Ozzy rules.

24:38.844 --> 24:40.744
Ozzy rules. Okay.

24:44.449 --> 24:46.940
Dad, what's goin' on?

24:47.018 --> 24:48.952
You two wait here.
I'll be right back.

24:53.058 --> 24:54.025
Hey!

24:54.092 --> 24:56.458
Whoa, whoa. Where you think
you're goin', milk?

24:56.528 --> 24:58.359
This here's
a charitable event.

24:58.430 --> 25:01.092
You wants to get in,
you gots to make a donation.

25:01.166 --> 25:03.532
Trust me, it is
off the hook in there.

25:03.602 --> 25:05.194
Off the what?
I live here.

25:06.438 --> 25:08.702
I don't care
if you're Halle Berry, man.

25:08.773 --> 25:10.638
No donation, no entry.

25:10.709 --> 25:13.371
How 'bout
if I call the police?

25:16.681 --> 25:17.875
Have a nice time.

25:35.233 --> 25:36.325
Oh, yeah.

25:36.401 --> 25:38.096
Yeah, baby, show me.

25:38.169 --> 25:40.797
Hey! What the hell
is going on here?

25:40.872 --> 25:42.669
Oh, yo, P., it's cool.

25:42.741 --> 25:44.231
See, I hit up my homegirl

25:44.309 --> 25:46.675
'cause I had to get my hair
done, as we both know.

25:46.745 --> 25:49.873
And then she called a friend.
They holler to other friends.

25:49.948 --> 25:52.246
Before you know it,
we got us a house par-ty.

25:53.718 --> 25:56.084
I want everyone
out of here now!

25:56.154 --> 25:58.486
People!

25:58.557 --> 26:00.320
People!

26:00.392 --> 26:02.917
Loosen your panties, Grandma.

26:02.994 --> 26:05.827
Look, you lock me out,
no money, no place to go.

26:05.897 --> 26:08.661
I mean, a girl got to get
her cheese on.

26:08.733 --> 26:10.530
Seven.

26:10.602 --> 26:11.830
This is insane!

26:11.903 --> 26:13.962
My boss' sister lives
across the street.

26:14.039 --> 26:16.132
I can't have all these peop...

26:18.043 --> 26:18.873
Hey!

26:18.944 --> 26:21.003
Give me a hard seven, baby.

26:21.079 --> 26:22.376
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

26:22.447 --> 26:24.745
She doesn't even have
her driver's permit.

26:24.816 --> 26:25.748
Dad.

26:25.817 --> 26:27.114
Do not go...

26:27.185 --> 26:28.482
Roll! Uh!

26:28.553 --> 26:30.020
Come on.

26:30.088 --> 26:31.385
Don't inhale.

26:31.456 --> 26:34.892
All right, now. Go on
and toss them bones, lil' man.

26:35.727 --> 26:36.887
Hey! Give me...

26:36.962 --> 26:38.122
I'm on a roll, Dad.

26:39.264 --> 26:41.494
Get out.

26:41.566 --> 26:45.468
I want you and your dogs
to go back to the pound now.

26:45.537 --> 26:46.868
What?

26:50.375 --> 26:51.535
Well, it was the dogs?

26:51.610 --> 26:53.544
Because she said dogs,
and then I said dogs,

26:53.612 --> 26:55.910
so I assumed
that would be okay.

26:55.981 --> 26:57.209
Huh?

27:05.824 --> 27:07.519
Whoo!

27:10.629 --> 27:12.187
Tsk.

27:13.632 --> 27:15.600
Bye, Tamika.
Y'all be good, now.

27:15.667 --> 27:16.827
Bye.

27:18.269 --> 27:20.260
Hey, hey.
Y'all got to go.

27:20.338 --> 27:22.272
- A'ight.
- That's a'ight.

27:25.076 --> 27:26.543
Hey, baby, gonna go.

27:26.611 --> 27:29.079
Oh, bye, Bear.
Thank you so much.

27:29.147 --> 27:31.513
Party's over.
Okay. Thanks for coming.

27:31.583 --> 27:33.210
But that's it. It's over.

27:33.284 --> 27:35.684
If I see Widow around,
I'm gonna tell him you're out.

27:35.754 --> 27:37.244
You know
he wants to know that.

27:37.322 --> 27:39.187
I don't know about that.
I'll see you.

27:39.257 --> 27:40.724
- Okay. Bye, baby.
- Bye-bye.

27:42.427 --> 27:43.860
It's like this.

27:43.928 --> 27:44.952
Hey.

27:45.030 --> 27:46.520
- How you doin', neighbor?
- What's up?

27:51.002 --> 27:52.902
What are you still doing here?

27:52.971 --> 27:55.201
- What was all that, Dad?
- Dad, who's this?

27:55.273 --> 27:56.365
This is no one.

27:56.441 --> 27:57.840
Tsk! What's up, lil' Romeo?

27:57.909 --> 27:59.638
My name is Charlene.
What's your name?

27:59.711 --> 28:00.473
I'm Georgey.

28:00.545 --> 28:02.570
You cannot meet
a nonexistent person.

28:02.647 --> 28:04.877
Can Charlene come to the club?

28:04.949 --> 28:06.416
Club? What club?

28:06.484 --> 28:08.384
We're not going to a club,
remember?

28:08.453 --> 28:10.887
We're going to Hawaii,
remember?

28:10.955 --> 28:12.946
Okay, you know the routine.
Outski!

28:13.024 --> 28:14.924
- Out! Let's go.
- Come on, man!

28:14.993 --> 28:16.790
Sarah, get the door.
Come on. Out.

28:16.861 --> 28:18.385
Out, out, out!

28:19.798 --> 28:21.789
- Wait!
- What?

28:21.866 --> 28:23.197
Give me my money, lil' boy.

28:23.268 --> 28:24.826
That money should go
to charity!

28:24.903 --> 28:25.961
Ohh!

28:29.974 --> 28:31.305
What did...

28:31.376 --> 28:32.673
Hey, I live here.

28:32.744 --> 28:34.177
Yeah!

28:36.314 --> 28:37.303
What?

28:43.254 --> 28:44.482
Okay, you guys.

28:44.556 --> 28:48.492
You know, you order hot dogs,
and you splash and frolic

28:48.560 --> 28:51.051
and just put everything on
my account and just have fun.

28:51.129 --> 28:52.756
Didn't you bring
your bathing suit?

28:52.831 --> 28:55.425
Oh, no.
I'm having tea with a client.

28:55.500 --> 28:57.627
But I will be right back.

28:57.702 --> 28:59.431
Whatever you say.

28:59.504 --> 29:01.404
Want to go swimming?

29:01.473 --> 29:02.462
With you?

29:02.540 --> 29:03.802
Forget you.

29:03.875 --> 29:04.807
Ow!

29:04.876 --> 29:06.343
How's it looking?

29:06.411 --> 29:08.402
Well, I was up all night
proofing.

29:08.480 --> 29:10.107
It's absolutely brilliant.

29:10.181 --> 29:12.911
And you've got the cleanest
background check I've ever seen.

29:12.984 --> 29:15.475
That background check
cost me a lot of fun in my life.

29:15.553 --> 29:17.953
I don't know, honey.

29:18.022 --> 29:19.887
Don't say anything.
She could hear you.

29:19.958 --> 29:21.016
What's crackin', ma?

29:21.092 --> 29:23.026
I'm lookin'
for the Sanderson table.

29:23.094 --> 29:24.561
We old college buddies.

29:24.629 --> 29:27.223
O-O-Okay.
He's i-in the dining room.

29:27.298 --> 29:28.287
I-I'll show you.

29:28.366 --> 29:29.355
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

29:29.434 --> 29:31.698
I tell you what...
I'll surprise him.

29:35.240 --> 29:37.572
No, you're in great shape.
I'm gonna take off.

29:37.642 --> 29:40.076
All right, you're right.
Nothing could go wrong.

29:40.145 --> 29:42.613
I've done this a million times
with important clients,

29:42.680 --> 29:43.772
so I'm fine.

29:43.848 --> 29:45.110
- Shazam.
- What?

29:47.185 --> 29:48.174
Oh, no.

29:50.054 --> 29:53.421
Oh, swing it,
you cocoa goddess.

29:53.491 --> 29:56.426
Cocoa Goddess? That's the rude
shock I was telling you about.

29:56.494 --> 29:57.825
That's Charlene?

29:58.897 --> 30:00.489
Did she see me?

30:03.401 --> 30:05.699
Okay, okay, okay, police.

30:05.770 --> 30:08.102
Uh, no.
Won't get here fast enough.

30:08.173 --> 30:09.504
Uh, security.

30:09.574 --> 30:12.042
No, she could probably
take him.

30:24.956 --> 30:26.423
Uh, money.

30:27.926 --> 30:29.450
She'll take money.

30:29.527 --> 30:32.519
Hi, hi. Here, just...
Here's whatever.

30:32.597 --> 30:35.589
And there's more where that came
from if you just leave now.

30:35.667 --> 30:38.135
No. Unh-unh, boyfriend.
We got business.

30:38.203 --> 30:39.602
Boyfriend?

30:39.671 --> 30:41.798
Oh, didn't I tell you?
We're dating now.

30:41.873 --> 30:43.135
It's some kind of street talk.

30:43.208 --> 30:44.937
It's street for
"I'm not going nowhere

30:45.009 --> 30:46.636
until you help my problem
go away."

30:46.711 --> 30:49.805
Look, Mrs. Arness,
a very important client,

30:49.881 --> 30:52.247
is due here any minute.

30:57.555 --> 30:58.647
Good afternoon.

30:58.723 --> 31:00.623
Good afternoon.
Mr. Sanderson?

31:00.692 --> 31:02.284
Oh, yes.
He's in the dining room.

31:02.360 --> 31:04.260
Thank you.

31:04.329 --> 31:06.354
Charlene, how 'bout you and I

31:06.431 --> 31:09.423
havin' a smart cocktail
down by the pool?

31:09.500 --> 31:10.762
Who is this fool?

31:10.835 --> 31:13.235
That's a good idea.
Just put it on my bill.

31:13.304 --> 31:16.000
I don't want no smart cocktail.
I need your help.

31:16.074 --> 31:17.507
Miss.

31:17.575 --> 31:18.940
Another martini.

31:19.010 --> 31:21.171
Oh, hell, no.
I know she ain't talkin' to me.

31:21.246 --> 31:22.804
Ashley,
she doesn't work here.

31:22.881 --> 31:25.076
If she isn't here to work,
then what is she here for?

31:25.149 --> 31:28.277
Oh, hells no, Miss Thing.
You best pump your brakes.

31:28.353 --> 31:29.684
She's my ex-wife's sister.

31:29.754 --> 31:31.745
I would have killed her
myself years ago.

31:31.823 --> 31:33.814
It's Mrs. Arness!

31:36.661 --> 31:39.960
Mmm. Old Iron Ass
be lookin' mean.

31:40.031 --> 31:41.464
Yes. You have to go.

31:41.532 --> 31:43.261
You like raw oysters,
Charlene?

31:45.336 --> 31:48.271
Yeah. I guess
I can hang out for a bit.

31:48.339 --> 31:50.466
They got any hot wings
around here?

31:51.109 --> 31:52.940
All right.
Whatever you want. Yes.

31:53.011 --> 31:54.535
- You give me a place to stay?
- Yes.

31:54.612 --> 31:56.637
- And you work on my case?
- Around the clock.

31:56.714 --> 31:58.113
I'll leave
when you expunge my record.

31:58.182 --> 31:59.809
Consider it expunged.

32:01.452 --> 32:03.943
All right.
I'd like a key, please.

32:08.326 --> 32:09.452
Mr. Sanderson?

32:09.527 --> 32:11.392
Mrs. Arness.

32:12.463 --> 32:14.397
Who is your associate?

32:15.466 --> 32:18.060
This is Howie Rottman,
the attorney I told you about.

32:18.136 --> 32:20.661
A great pleasure
to meet you, Mrs. Arness.

32:20.738 --> 32:21.796
I meant her.

32:21.873 --> 32:23.500
Oh.

32:23.574 --> 32:24.563
Her?

32:24.642 --> 32:25.574
Her?

32:25.643 --> 32:27.338
Her is... her...

32:27.412 --> 32:30.040
She is our... our nanny.

32:31.582 --> 32:33.106
Dad, I'm bored.

32:33.184 --> 32:35.152
Kids, how good to see you.

32:35.219 --> 32:38.279
Don't we just love
our nanny, Charlene?

32:40.258 --> 32:42.556
Uh... Y-yeah.

32:44.696 --> 32:48.325
Don't you just love being
our nanny, Charlene?

32:55.740 --> 32:57.173
Yessir.

33:00.178 --> 33:02.908
Now I'm gonna go on down
to the pool with the child'n.

33:02.981 --> 33:05.677
Maybe we make fun of the white
folks again, huh, kids?

33:05.750 --> 33:06.910
Ooh-hoo!

33:06.985 --> 33:08.782
Oh, the kids just love her.

33:08.853 --> 33:10.377
- What a sense of humor.
- Yeah.

33:10.455 --> 33:12.423
Peter, I'm going to hang
by the pool.

33:12.490 --> 33:14.458
If you need me,
that's where I'll be.

33:14.525 --> 33:16.288
Mrs. Arness.

33:16.361 --> 33:17.919
Uh, right this way,
Mrs. Arness.

33:17.996 --> 33:19.486
Come, William.

33:19.564 --> 33:20.792
You have the papers?

33:20.865 --> 33:22.298
Oh, yes, yes, I do.

33:22.367 --> 33:23.994
Strange clothes for a nanny.

33:24.068 --> 33:26.036
Well, it's a fashion to kids.

33:26.104 --> 33:28.095
- Ow!
- William, mind.

33:39.550 --> 33:42.383
Hello, Sanderson family!

33:43.855 --> 33:45.823
Georgey,
don't forget poker night!

33:45.890 --> 33:47.152
I won't.

33:47.225 --> 33:49.216
How could I forget
poker night?

34:08.012 --> 34:09.603
I propose a toast.

34:09.679 --> 34:10.668
Okay.

34:10.748 --> 34:11.942
Mm-hmm.

34:12.016 --> 34:13.916
To us.

34:15.987 --> 34:17.215
May we always...

34:19.357 --> 34:21.052
- Mmm.
- Sorry. It's mine.

34:21.125 --> 34:23.059
Oh, you're not gonna
answer that, are you?

34:23.127 --> 34:28.121
Well, it might be...
might be one of my kids.

34:28.199 --> 34:30.063
Just one minute.

34:36.007 --> 34:37.031
Sorry.

34:38.342 --> 34:39.434
Hello?

34:39.510 --> 34:40.875
Hey, it's me.

34:40.945 --> 34:42.936
Oh, hi, Ashley.
Everything okay?

34:43.014 --> 34:45.482
I don't know.

34:45.550 --> 34:47.848
I saw Peter hanging out
at the club today.

34:47.918 --> 34:50.183
He was mingling with
a large black woman.

34:50.254 --> 34:52.949
What? What are you
talking about?

34:53.024 --> 34:54.514
He said it was his nanny.

34:54.592 --> 34:57.025
She didn't look like any nanny
I'd ever seen.

34:57.094 --> 35:01.623
She was all...
tattooed and welfarish.

35:01.699 --> 35:03.530
It was...

35:03.601 --> 35:06.229
Oh, is that funny to you?
Is that funny?

35:07.505 --> 35:09.132
Am I funny to you?

35:09.207 --> 35:10.834
No, no.
That's not funny.

35:10.908 --> 35:11.875
Were you laughing at me?

35:11.943 --> 35:13.433
Oh, I wasn't...

35:13.511 --> 35:14.671
Stop. Get away.

35:14.745 --> 35:17.475
No, I wasn't
laughing at you.

35:17.548 --> 35:19.175
Just... hang on.

35:19.250 --> 35:22.083
Um, you know, look,
I know Peter. I know him.

35:22.153 --> 35:24.678
He's not gonna spend all his
time taking care of the kids.

35:24.755 --> 35:25.881
He went and hired somebody!

35:25.957 --> 35:28.187
Seriously, Kate!
This woman was no nanny.

35:28.259 --> 35:30.159
You need to do something.

35:30.228 --> 35:31.752
I saw this woman.
I was there.

35:31.829 --> 35:34.059
Shouldn't you at least
be looking at references?

35:34.132 --> 35:35.724
Thank you. Thank you.

35:35.800 --> 35:39.099
Listen, Peter is nothing
if not responsible.

35:39.170 --> 35:41.832
It's not like he's gonna
hire a convicted felon.

35:41.906 --> 35:43.931
Oh, I wouldn't be too sure
about that.

35:44.008 --> 35:44.940
Ohh!

35:45.009 --> 35:47.807
Let's see... we got resisting
arrest, assaulting an officer,

35:47.879 --> 35:49.904
repeated attempts
at eye-gouging,

35:49.981 --> 35:52.449
and... scrotum crushing.

35:52.517 --> 35:54.917
Well, I was a little riled up,
being framed and all.

35:54.986 --> 35:58.080
And your clothes and I.D.
Were found at the scene.

35:58.156 --> 36:00.124
All plants.
I never robbed nobody!

36:00.191 --> 36:02.455
Okay.

36:02.527 --> 36:04.290
I know my rights.
I get an appeal.

36:04.362 --> 36:05.624
I get an appeal!

36:05.696 --> 36:08.460
You only get an appeal if you
were convicted and incarcerated.

36:08.533 --> 36:10.592
You were released.

36:10.668 --> 36:12.397
Look, why don't you just
start over?

36:13.638 --> 36:16.266
Go back to school and get
at least a passing familiarity

36:16.340 --> 36:18.604
With the English language.

36:18.676 --> 36:20.576
It's no end
to what you can accomplish

36:20.645 --> 36:21.805
with a little commitment.

36:21.879 --> 36:23.608
My daughter Sarah
is fully committed,

36:23.681 --> 36:26.081
and she's going places.

36:26.984 --> 36:29.418
Oh, she's goin' places,
all right.

36:29.487 --> 36:32.581
So, it's a charitable
remainder trust.

36:32.657 --> 36:35.125
That way, the old tightwad gets
a huge deduction every year.

36:36.227 --> 36:37.922
Uh, no more calls, Sofia.

36:37.995 --> 36:39.929
It's not a call.
There's someone here...

36:39.997 --> 36:41.328
Girl, get out!

36:41.399 --> 36:42.889
I do not know who you are...

36:42.967 --> 36:45.265
Send her in.

36:47.305 --> 36:48.636
Bet you know me now, huh?

36:48.706 --> 36:51.140
This couldn't wait
until tonight?

36:51.209 --> 36:52.437
Well, well, well!

36:52.510 --> 36:53.977
Come in, have a seat,
spend some time.

36:54.045 --> 36:55.910
Thanks, homeboy,
and, no, it can't wait.

36:55.980 --> 36:57.004
You gotta check this out.

36:57.081 --> 36:58.912
- What is it?
- I found the deposition.

36:58.983 --> 37:00.917
The prosecution interviewed
an eyewitness,

37:00.985 --> 37:03.044
and she told them
that the perpetrator

37:03.120 --> 37:05.350
didn't have a tattoo
on the chest.

37:05.423 --> 37:07.414
They never told my lawyer
about this shit.

37:07.491 --> 37:08.458
That's withholding exculp...

37:08.526 --> 37:11.324
Exculpatory evidence.
People vs. Stanley, I know.

37:12.697 --> 37:13.959
How do you know that?

37:14.031 --> 37:16.864
Why wouldn't she know that?
She's got it goin' on.

37:16.934 --> 37:19.425
Damn, Pete, all I did in there
was read law books.

37:19.503 --> 37:21.027
And with comprehension.

37:21.105 --> 37:22.766
Made you think I was a lawyer.

37:22.840 --> 37:25.673
I mean, you obviously have
pockets of intelligence.

37:25.743 --> 37:30.806
So, why do you walk and talk
and act the way you do?

37:30.881 --> 37:32.439
Because it's sexy.

37:33.384 --> 37:35.716
It ain't actin'!

37:35.786 --> 37:36.980
This is who I am.

37:37.054 --> 37:39.488
I mean, you think
I can't talk like you?

37:39.557 --> 37:40.819
Oh, Peter,

37:40.891 --> 37:43.018
I absolutely love what
you've done with the place!

37:43.094 --> 37:46.655
It's so sterile, so...
so bland, so wonderful!

37:46.731 --> 37:48.358
See? You can do it.

37:48.432 --> 37:50.297
Oh, you like that, huh?

37:50.368 --> 37:52.199
Well, you can kiss
my natural black ass,

37:52.270 --> 37:53.396
because I don't need
your approval.

37:53.471 --> 37:55.564
No, she don't need
your approval.

37:55.640 --> 37:58.165
Hey, you don't think
I compromise the way I act?

37:58.242 --> 38:01.177
You think I like walking around
like an uptight... honky?

38:02.146 --> 38:04.011
Yes. I know your lingo.

38:06.717 --> 38:08.480
Peter, Mr. Tobias
is coming to see you.

38:08.552 --> 38:09.541
Oh, God.

38:10.821 --> 38:12.220
Well, this should be
interesting.

38:12.290 --> 38:15.157
Uh-oh. What we gotta do,
play "hide the sister"?

38:15.226 --> 38:17.660
Or do I gotta do
that slave thing again?

38:17.728 --> 38:20.219
Just... just act natural.

38:21.799 --> 38:24.029
- Let's get her out of here.
- Why don't we get her out?

38:35.746 --> 38:37.680
Peter... Howie.

38:37.748 --> 38:39.511
Ed.

38:39.583 --> 38:40.880
Who is this?

38:40.951 --> 38:43.146
- Uh, this is the...
- Well, we were just having...

38:43.220 --> 38:46.121
Well, Mr. Sanderson,
I can see you are very busy.

38:46.190 --> 38:48.215
That's why I really
appreciate you

38:48.292 --> 38:50.522
offering your services
free of charge.

38:50.594 --> 38:52.892
Oh, I... well,
I just... gosh.

38:52.963 --> 38:54.260
Peter...

38:54.332 --> 38:55.424
She is...

38:55.499 --> 38:57.228
Well, see,
Mr. Sanderson here,

38:57.301 --> 38:59.667
being the heavenly man
that he is...

38:59.737 --> 39:01.136
God bless you!

39:01.205 --> 39:03.503
Oh, you got that anointing
on you...

39:03.574 --> 39:06.737
...has offered to do the taxes
for the Compton Evangelistic

39:06.811 --> 39:09.279
Episcopal Baptist church
of South Central.

39:09.347 --> 39:11.747
You know,
just anything to help

39:11.816 --> 39:13.807
Reverend Shack... tillfont.

39:15.152 --> 39:16.244
Just call him Shack.

39:16.320 --> 39:17.344
Shack.

39:17.421 --> 39:18.911
Well, I'll let you guys go.

39:18.989 --> 39:21.048
I'll see you at choir rehearsal
on Thursday.

39:21.125 --> 39:22.251
7:00, now!

39:24.328 --> 39:27.855
I'll escort
Mrs. Shacktill... font

39:27.932 --> 39:29.160
to the elevator.

39:29.233 --> 39:30.666
Gentlemen.

39:30.735 --> 39:33.636
Uh, Peter,
we're really in a crunch.

39:33.704 --> 39:36.002
I just got word that another
firm's in the running

39:36.073 --> 39:37.472
for the R <i>&</i> S account.

39:37.541 --> 39:39.065
We need to close this deal.

39:39.143 --> 39:40.235
Look...

39:40.311 --> 39:42.438
I have no problem being
Peter's wingman on this one.

39:42.513 --> 39:45.448
Oh, well, thanks anyway, but I
really have it under control,

39:45.516 --> 39:47.450
so, you don't have to worry
about a thing, Ed.

39:47.518 --> 39:50.487
Good. Then I'll expect you
to wrap it up in a day or two.

39:50.554 --> 39:52.749
That's the plan, certainly.

39:52.823 --> 39:54.313
Ah.

40:04.602 --> 40:06.331
Well.

40:09.907 --> 40:10.839
Could you...

40:10.908 --> 40:12.671
- Sure.
- Thank you.

40:23.421 --> 40:24.820
Thank you.

40:24.889 --> 40:26.823
She can't tee up her own ball?

40:26.891 --> 40:31.260
I've been playing this game
for many years...

40:31.328 --> 40:32.852
That's what it feels like.

40:32.930 --> 40:35.125
...and it's all about
patience.

40:52.917 --> 40:55.215
Well, you beat me by 19.

40:55.286 --> 40:57.481
MRS. ARNESS:
Uh, let's make it 20.

40:57.555 --> 40:58.579
All right.

40:58.656 --> 40:59.953
Mrs. Arness, I was wondering

41:00.024 --> 41:01.958
if you'd like to come over
to my house on Thursday

41:02.026 --> 41:04.187
and possibly
look over the contract.

41:04.261 --> 41:06.422
I'll have to check with
my secretary, Julia.

41:06.497 --> 41:08.727
Mrs. Arness, would you
excuse me for a minute?

41:08.799 --> 41:10.562
I just have to
check on my children.

41:10.634 --> 41:12.226
Oh, of course.
You do that.

41:12.303 --> 41:14.328
I'd like to dip you
in Cheez Whiz

41:14.405 --> 41:16.532
and spread you over
a Ritz Cracker,

41:16.607 --> 41:18.199
if I'm not being too subtle.

41:19.276 --> 41:22.245
Boy, you are
some kind of freaky.

41:22.313 --> 41:23.974
Oh, you have no idea.

41:24.048 --> 41:25.879
You got me
straight trippin', boo.

41:25.950 --> 41:28.510
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, what are you doing here?

41:28.586 --> 41:30.554
What does it look like?
I'm on a date.

41:30.621 --> 41:31.383
On a date.

41:31.455 --> 41:34.253
She's on a date?
She's a felon.

41:34.325 --> 41:36.953
- I am not a felon.
- Hey, what is she doing here?

41:37.027 --> 41:38.392
Get used to it, Twiggy.

41:38.462 --> 41:40.896
You're gonna be seeing
a lot more of me around here.

41:40.965 --> 41:42.557
Not without a broom
in your hand.

41:42.633 --> 41:45.864
If I have, it's 'cause I'm here
to sweep up the white trash.

41:45.936 --> 41:48.302
Save it for the YMCA, Jemima.

41:48.372 --> 41:50.704
Bitch! I'm gonna kick
the bulimia out of your ass!

41:50.774 --> 41:53.106
Have you ever had
a tempered moment?

41:53.177 --> 41:55.839
Why don't you go back to the
vodka bottle you crawled out of?

41:55.913 --> 41:56.902
Mrs. Arness is here.

41:56.981 --> 41:58.915
I am sheltering you.
I'm helping you.

41:58.983 --> 42:00.143
Remember, I helped you...

42:00.217 --> 42:02.481
All right!
I'll let it ride.

42:02.553 --> 42:05.317
Thank you for letting it ride.
That is wise and mature.

42:05.389 --> 42:07.380
Now, just get her walking
that way.

42:07.458 --> 42:09.585
Let me show you the place,
Charlene.

42:12.463 --> 42:13.725
Looking good, Lois!

42:14.632 --> 42:16.566
Hey, freak boy...

42:16.634 --> 42:20.001
I'm gonna make myself a little
more luscious for you, okay?

42:20.070 --> 42:21.731
I'll be right back.

42:23.040 --> 42:25.838
Okay, precious.

42:35.819 --> 42:37.252
What are you doin' in here?

42:37.321 --> 42:39.755
I told you you was gonna be
seein' more of me, right?

42:39.823 --> 42:41.916
Look, I came here to warn you.

42:41.992 --> 42:43.357
You keep disrespecting me,

42:43.427 --> 42:45.520
and it's gonna get rough
around here.

42:46.597 --> 42:48.189
Back off, Shaniqua.

42:48.265 --> 42:49.425
You don't scare me.

42:49.500 --> 42:50.694
You know what? That's it.

42:50.768 --> 42:53.965
You must need a little more
eye shadow, right? Come on!

43:03.447 --> 43:06.007
You've messed with
the wrong W.A.S.P., bitch.

43:29.707 --> 43:31.072
Compliments of Tae-Bo,

43:31.141 --> 43:33.336
two hours a day,
five days a week.

44:12.750 --> 44:15.913
Compliments of the 'hood,
24 hours a day, all my life.

44:25.896 --> 44:29.024
You know, for a skinny white ho,
you're pretty tough.

44:48.018 --> 44:52.614
And I don't <i>ever</i> want to have
this conversation again!

45:02.466 --> 45:06.766
"The girl had dou..."

45:08.839 --> 45:10.101
"...ble..."

45:10.174 --> 45:13.769
"...double D-cups."

45:13.844 --> 45:16.244
There you go. You got it,
lil' man.

45:16.313 --> 45:22.980
"I put my mouth
on her nip..."

45:23.053 --> 45:24.452
"...ples."

45:24.521 --> 45:25.681
What is that?

45:26.724 --> 45:28.624
What are you doing
letting him read th...

45:28.692 --> 45:30.489
He read. You read.

45:30.561 --> 45:32.188
Georgey, you read.

45:32.262 --> 45:33.661
I'm gonna kill you!

45:33.731 --> 45:35.028
I am so proud of you.

45:35.099 --> 45:36.293
I'm turning you in!

45:36.366 --> 45:38.197
Pfft.
I found it in your drawer.

45:38.268 --> 45:42.136
Well, I am a grown man
of 54... 41... 49 years old,

45:42.206 --> 45:45.175
and he's 8, and what I read
in the privacy of my...

45:45.242 --> 45:46.334
How'd you do it?

45:46.410 --> 45:48.935
Oh, God,
I'm never gonna get this done.

45:49.012 --> 45:51.242
Look,
the boy don't look carefully

45:51.315 --> 45:52.873
at the details in a word,

45:52.950 --> 45:55.384
so most of the time,
he's just guessin'.

45:55.452 --> 45:57.215
What you got to do
is just slow it down

45:57.287 --> 45:59.221
and give him somethin'
stimulatin' to read.

45:59.289 --> 46:00.984
Dad?

46:01.058 --> 46:02.184
What's a rack?

46:02.259 --> 46:03.283
It's a country.

46:04.461 --> 46:06.395
Well...

46:06.463 --> 46:09.955
I was just doin' it
'cause he was botherin' me.

46:10.033 --> 46:11.125
Well, either way...

46:12.336 --> 46:13.826
Can you get rid of this?

46:13.904 --> 46:15.201
Just put it back in my room,

46:15.272 --> 46:17.399
'cause I'll get rid of it,
'cause I have a special...

46:23.046 --> 46:26.812
Well, Mrs. Kline,
how wonderful to see you.

46:26.884 --> 46:27.816
Come in!

46:27.885 --> 46:29.648
It's girls poker night
at the house.

46:29.720 --> 46:30.812
Where's my little dealer?

46:30.888 --> 46:33.550
Well, just wait right here,
and I will just go get him.

46:33.624 --> 46:35.524
Georgey, Mrs. Kline is here!

46:35.592 --> 46:36.581
Hi, Mrs. Kline.

46:36.660 --> 46:38.423
Come on, Georgey!

46:38.495 --> 46:40.486
Tonight, I'm gonna
teach you to bluff.

46:42.966 --> 46:45.491
And I think we need to
comb your hair differently.

46:45.569 --> 46:47.002
You look like a fag.

46:47.070 --> 46:48.867
- I'm not a fag!
- I didn't say you were.

46:48.939 --> 46:50.566
- Hello.
- Hi. How are you?

46:50.641 --> 46:52.040
Oh, good evening, sir.

46:52.109 --> 46:54.304
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

46:54.378 --> 46:57.575
Dad, I don't want you
to freak out, okay?

46:57.648 --> 46:59.639
Why would I freak out?

46:59.716 --> 47:02.617
Well...

47:02.686 --> 47:04.586
Dad, this is Aaron.

47:04.655 --> 47:06.350
Hi.

47:06.423 --> 47:07.856
- Hello.
- How do you do, sir?

47:07.925 --> 47:10.052
I-I-I'm so glad
to actually meet you.

47:10.127 --> 47:12.721
I-I-I told Sarah
that it was very important

47:12.796 --> 47:14.559
that you feel comfortable
with me

47:14.631 --> 47:17.361
taking her to
my parents' for dinner.

47:19.703 --> 47:21.193
So, this is a date?

47:22.806 --> 47:26.867
Oh, um, I'll have her home
by 11:00 at the latest, sir?

47:30.180 --> 47:32.580
I guess that'd be all right.

47:47.431 --> 47:48.921
All right. Did it work?

47:48.999 --> 47:51.160
Yeah, like a charm, my friend.

47:51.235 --> 47:54.227
All right. Let's party.

47:54.304 --> 47:55.430
Hey, watch the seats.

47:55.505 --> 47:56.836
- All right...
- Oh, shut up.

47:56.907 --> 47:58.499
No, I'm serious.
It's leather.

48:04.214 --> 48:05.238
Hmm.

48:11.121 --> 48:13.521
Well, look at you,
all growed up.

48:16.126 --> 48:18.185
There's nothing to eat
in the house.

48:18.262 --> 48:20.355
Yeah.
You comin' to a point?

48:24.601 --> 48:26.694
Well, I'm hungry.
Are you?

48:29.339 --> 48:30.465
You askin' me out?

48:30.540 --> 48:33.134
Well, no, I'm not.

48:34.711 --> 48:36.872
Yes, I am.

48:39.049 --> 48:40.038
Okay.

49:04.541 --> 49:06.941
Oh, look at the legs
on this wine.

49:07.010 --> 49:09.672
I'm telling you,
this place is bangin'.

49:09.746 --> 49:12.078
Don't you just mean,
"This is nice"?

49:12.149 --> 49:14.845
Why the word "bangin"'
make you so uptight?

49:14.918 --> 49:17.751
You're smart... if you'd just
deign to speak English

49:17.821 --> 49:20.085
with what you learned
on the Internet and in prison,

49:20.157 --> 49:21.954
you could be
a paralegal tomorrow.

49:22.025 --> 49:25.153
Like they gonna be beatin' down
my door to let me in school.

49:25.228 --> 49:27.594
You're exactly
the kind of person they want.

49:27.664 --> 49:30.155
Well, why would I want
to do that, anyway?

49:30.233 --> 49:31.723
I've been to your office.

49:31.802 --> 49:33.929
Everybody's all uptight,
overworked,

49:34.004 --> 49:36.370
tired, stressed-out,
don't see their family.

49:36.440 --> 49:38.374
"Ooh, Ed is comin'."
"Ooh, Tobias."

49:38.442 --> 49:40.410
I get a wedgie
just walking in your office.

49:40.477 --> 49:42.377
Hey, it's what people do.
They work.

49:42.446 --> 49:45.609
Look, all I'm sayin' is
I did the confinement thing

49:45.682 --> 49:46.876
for four years.

49:46.950 --> 49:49.077
If you're so concerned
with my future,

49:49.152 --> 49:50.915
just help me clear my name.

49:50.988 --> 49:52.512
I got it from there.

49:52.589 --> 49:54.557
I got my own dreams,
my own goals.

49:56.193 --> 49:57.455
Hey, give it to me.

49:57.527 --> 49:59.188
Hey!
What'd you do that for?!

49:59.262 --> 50:01.457
- 'Cause you work too much.
- This is my phone!

50:01.531 --> 50:03.226
That's probably why your wife
left your sorry ass.

50:03.300 --> 50:05.598
Okay, Oprah, if you're so good
at relationships,

50:05.669 --> 50:07.466
how come you don't
have a boyfriend?

50:07.537 --> 50:08.799
I had one.

50:10.774 --> 50:12.867
It's just I haven't seen
or heard from him

50:12.943 --> 50:14.570
since I went in
four years ago.

50:15.645 --> 50:16.942
Were you in love with him?

50:41.204 --> 50:42.637
Come on, let's go dance.

50:42.706 --> 50:43.832
Ha ha ha ha... no.

50:43.907 --> 50:46.967
Come on. When is
the last time you danced?

50:47.044 --> 50:48.511
At my wedding.

50:48.578 --> 50:51.672
Don't worry, I can dance.
It's just that I don't wanna.

50:51.748 --> 50:54.114
Come on, smooth. Show me
what you're workin' with.

50:54.184 --> 50:56.015
I can dance.
I just don't want to dance.

50:56.086 --> 50:57.383
Man, you can't dance.

50:57.454 --> 50:59.684
- Well, I got moves.
- Let me see.

50:59.756 --> 51:01.417
All right, all right.

51:01.491 --> 51:04.221
Okay, one last
little drink here.

51:11.001 --> 51:12.263
What, you got to pee?

51:12.335 --> 51:14.098
This was big in high school.

51:14.171 --> 51:16.696
Man, look, you can't dance
from your brain.

51:16.773 --> 51:18.365
You gotta feel it.
Now, come on.

51:18.442 --> 51:20.171
Show me how
you made them kids.

51:23.680 --> 51:25.113
- What the hell...
- How's this?

51:25.182 --> 51:27.207
That's great for an epileptic.
Come on, now.

51:27.284 --> 51:29.013
You gotta move your pelvis
with it.

51:29.086 --> 51:31.680
More hips.
There you go.

51:31.755 --> 51:33.416
Get smooth with it.

51:37.127 --> 51:40.221
Well, I'm sorry.
I can't help it. I miss him.

51:40.297 --> 51:42.458
Oh, snap out of it, already.

51:43.533 --> 51:45.558
I'm snapped. I'm snappy.

51:51.741 --> 51:53.572
Oh, God, Ash.

51:53.643 --> 51:56.009
I still can't believe
you were hit by a car.

51:57.080 --> 51:58.980
Did you call a lawyer?

51:59.049 --> 52:01.483
Oh, I can't talk to a lawyer.
I was jaywalking.

52:01.551 --> 52:02.984
So, can we just stop...

52:04.421 --> 52:06.184
- What?
- Oh, my God.

52:09.593 --> 52:11.254
What?

52:16.466 --> 52:17.865
Look at that!

52:19.269 --> 52:22.329
Oh, my God, it's true.
Look at that! Look at that!

52:23.940 --> 52:25.874
He never danced like that
with me.

52:25.942 --> 52:28.342
I'm gonna go talk to him.

52:29.079 --> 52:30.910
No! Sit!

52:30.981 --> 52:32.039
Why?

52:33.116 --> 52:34.378
I can't tell you.

52:34.451 --> 52:35.850
If I talk about it,

52:35.919 --> 52:39.082
gangster people will come
to my house and cut me.

52:41.691 --> 52:43.625
Oh.

52:45.128 --> 52:48.461
Oh, he almost looks
like a fun person.

52:51.234 --> 52:52.895
Must've been me.

52:52.969 --> 52:54.630
Was it me?

52:54.704 --> 52:56.934
No. Stop beating yourself up.
It's him.

52:57.007 --> 52:58.975
Can we just
get out of here? Now?

52:59.042 --> 53:01.033
You know what they say...

53:01.111 --> 53:03.944
once you go black,
you never go back.

53:06.283 --> 53:08.046
Can we get the check, please?

53:40.784 --> 53:42.547
And that's why
I worked so hard,

53:42.619 --> 53:45.452
so I could give Kate a good
life, then it backfired!

53:45.522 --> 53:47.649
Man, bitches don't care
nothin' about that shit.

53:47.724 --> 53:50.284
Oh, bitches do too care.

53:50.360 --> 53:51.987
I'm gonna
tell you a secret...

53:52.062 --> 53:54.929
sometimes I drive by our old
house, and I just look at it,

53:54.998 --> 53:57.432
and I just remember our life,
and it just hurts!

53:57.500 --> 53:59.525
Man, that is so pathetic,
P. Diddy.

53:59.603 --> 54:02.037
But you know what?
I'm gonna help you get her back.

54:02.105 --> 54:03.163
How?

54:03.240 --> 54:05.265
Well, first,
we gotta create a mood.

54:07.711 --> 54:10.271
Just like at
the restaurant, baby.

54:10.347 --> 54:11.609
I'm already there.

54:11.681 --> 54:13.672
Yeah.
Now, feel the Barry.

54:13.750 --> 54:16.344
Feel Barry White.
Talk like Barry.

54:16.419 --> 54:18.444
- Okay, that's Barry.
- Yeah.

54:18.521 --> 54:19.545
This is Kate.

54:19.623 --> 54:21.215
Hey, Kate. Yeah.

54:21.291 --> 54:23.225
I want you to talk nasty
to her!

54:23.293 --> 54:25.124
Talk nasty!

54:25.195 --> 54:29.825
I'd like to kiss you a lot.

54:29.899 --> 54:31.696
Cut that sensitive shit,
Nancy Boy!

54:31.768 --> 54:32.700
What?

54:32.769 --> 54:34.464
- You gotta be a beast!
- A beast!

54:34.537 --> 54:35.469
Yeah!

54:35.538 --> 54:37.199
In the bedroom,
a woman wants a man

54:37.274 --> 54:39.208
that knows how to ride her
when she bucks.

54:39.276 --> 54:41.870
Ride 'em when she bucks!
Ride 'em!

54:41.945 --> 54:44.641
It's just... I can't.
It's a sculpture. I just can't.

54:44.714 --> 54:46.545
All right, okay.

54:46.616 --> 54:47.878
Use me, then.

54:50.120 --> 54:51.052
Huh?

54:51.121 --> 54:52.315
Damn it, grab these.

54:52.389 --> 54:53.481
- What?!
- Grab 'em!

54:53.556 --> 54:54.989
Ohh!

54:57.827 --> 55:00.796
Oh, I get it, yeah.

55:00.864 --> 55:03.332
- Hey, Kate.
- Uh-huh.

55:03.400 --> 55:05.800
Yeah, you've been waitin'
for this for a while, huh?

55:05.869 --> 55:07.962
That's right. Now,
what you gonna do to her?

55:08.038 --> 55:10.029
I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do!

55:10.106 --> 55:13.075
I'm gonna give you
an aromatherapy massage

55:13.143 --> 55:14.633
with incense!

55:14.711 --> 55:16.269
No! Come on, now!

55:16.346 --> 55:18.314
Wimps give
aromatherapy massages!

55:18.381 --> 55:19.507
Tell her again!

55:19.582 --> 55:21.106
All right!

55:21.184 --> 55:22.947
I'm gonna have...

55:23.019 --> 55:25.783
sexual intercourse, baby!

55:25.855 --> 55:29.416
No, you... you a beast!
You need some of these.

55:29.492 --> 55:31.392
- Yeah.
- <i>Cojones grande!</i>

55:31.461 --> 55:34.191
Yeah! I'm gonna put 'em
in my pants!

55:34.264 --> 55:36.425
- Get in there, boys!
- Now, grab 'em!

55:36.499 --> 55:38.524
- Grab 'em. Yeah, hey, baby!
- Grab 'em!

55:38.601 --> 55:41.092
Now, what you gonna do?
What you gonna do?!

55:41.171 --> 55:43.571
Yeah, Mama! You gonna be
my tawdry little woman?

55:43.640 --> 55:45.870
Damn right!
Now get to humpin'!

55:45.942 --> 55:47.603
- Ya-hoo!
- Whoa!

55:47.677 --> 55:49.110
- How 'bout that, huh?!
- Yeah!

55:49.179 --> 55:51.272
How would you like me
to pounce on you

55:51.348 --> 55:53.908
- like a lion from above?
- I like it! I like it!

55:53.983 --> 55:55.678
- Yo!
- That's what I'm talkin'!

55:55.752 --> 55:57.686
You ain't just
no king of the jungle,

55:57.754 --> 55:59.051
you own that jungle!

55:59.122 --> 56:00.612
That's your pride!

56:00.690 --> 56:02.419
You own that jungle,
and ain't no one

56:02.492 --> 56:04.483
gonna come around
and mess with your pride!

56:04.561 --> 56:06.654
That's right!
I like that.

56:06.730 --> 56:09.221
Yeah! You ain't ready
for that shit! Come on, now!

56:09.299 --> 56:11.927
Be a beast! What you gonna do
when she starts ridin', huh?

56:12.001 --> 56:13.798
Take care of her!
That's what I'm gonna do!

56:13.870 --> 56:15.963
- Uh-huh! Uh-huh!
- You're mine, Kate!

56:16.039 --> 56:18.064
- Ride that lighting rod!
- You don't need these no more.

56:18.141 --> 56:20.609
You got your own!
You found your balls!

56:20.677 --> 56:23.441
Yeah, I don't need those balls!
I got my own balls!

56:27.517 --> 56:29.007
Mandingo!

56:31.020 --> 56:33.955
What goes on in your personal
life is none of our business,

56:34.023 --> 56:35.513
but if it begins
to affect the firm,

56:35.592 --> 56:36.923
we need to call attention
to it.

56:36.993 --> 56:39.052
Guys, we were moving a statue,

56:39.129 --> 56:41.597
and we lost our footing,
and we fell.

56:41.664 --> 56:43.291
My sister's
under the impression

56:43.366 --> 56:45.698
that you were
humping your nanny.

56:45.769 --> 56:48.431
I was not humping my nanny!

56:48.505 --> 56:52.271
Peter, surely you understand
that if Mrs. Arness

56:52.342 --> 56:56.711
were to suspect any instability
on your part...

56:56.780 --> 57:00.341
There is no instability
in my home.

57:01.351 --> 57:03.148
You sure
you can trust this guy?

57:03.219 --> 57:05.551
Well, hey,
he's helping me reopen my case.

57:05.622 --> 57:07.021
Y'all got any leads?

57:07.090 --> 57:09.957
Well, a still from
the bank surveillance camera

57:10.026 --> 57:11.186
is on its way here,

57:11.261 --> 57:13.855
and we found a deposition
that could help.

57:13.930 --> 57:15.295
Well, that's cool, baby.

57:15.365 --> 57:17.526
If there's anything
I can do to help,

57:17.600 --> 57:19.795
anything...
you just holler.

57:21.304 --> 57:22.737
I gotta run.

57:22.806 --> 57:26.503
Hey, Widow, if you meant
what you just said,

57:26.576 --> 57:28.544
it's not gonna be an easy job.

57:28.611 --> 57:31.102
I know it ain't.

57:31.181 --> 57:33.615
I just gotta know
that if things get rough,

57:33.683 --> 57:36.447
you're not gonna run out
on me.

57:36.519 --> 57:39.181
I've been waitin'
four years for this.

57:39.255 --> 57:40.517
I ain't gonna mess up.

58:08.184 --> 58:09.674
Planning another heist?

58:11.888 --> 58:14.049
No.
Why would you say that?

58:14.123 --> 58:15.556
I don't know.

58:15.625 --> 58:17.889
Maybe it was hearing
the words "job" and "hot"

58:17.961 --> 58:20.327
bandied between
two tattooed people?

58:20.396 --> 58:23.627
That was just my old boyfriend
I told you about... Widow.

58:23.700 --> 58:26.567
He's just tryin'
to get back with me.

58:26.636 --> 58:28.069
Mm-hmm.

58:28.137 --> 58:30.264
I'm tellin' you the truth!

58:30.340 --> 58:32.103
Look, I just didn't
want you to see him,

58:32.175 --> 58:36.475
because Widow, he ain't been
the best boyfriend,

58:36.546 --> 58:39.242
and I knew
he'd be all over me.

58:39.315 --> 58:41.875
Now you suddenly care
what I think?

58:43.386 --> 58:44.375
No.

58:45.822 --> 58:47.881
Maybe.

58:48.958 --> 58:50.550
A little bit.

58:54.531 --> 58:56.260
No more late visits?

58:56.332 --> 58:57.765
Word.

58:57.834 --> 58:59.233
Convicted felon's honor?

58:59.302 --> 59:02.135
Innocent convicted felon's
honor.

59:04.073 --> 59:06.439
Now, give me some dap,
right there on the edge.

59:06.509 --> 59:08.136
Right there, and then
come up here like that.

59:08.211 --> 59:09.610
Pow, like that.

59:09.679 --> 59:10.611
Hello?

59:10.680 --> 59:11.647
Dad!

59:11.714 --> 59:12.772
Hey, sweetie.

59:12.849 --> 59:14.282
Is Charlene there?

59:14.350 --> 59:16.614
Yeah, she's here.
Do you want to talk to her?

59:16.686 --> 59:18.153
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm...

59:18.221 --> 59:19.279
All right.

59:19.355 --> 59:21.755
- Sarah? Okay.
- Girl talk.

59:21.824 --> 59:23.314
What up, dog?

59:23.393 --> 59:26.851
I need you to come pick me up.
I can't talk about it right now.

59:26.930 --> 59:27.794
Where you at?

59:27.864 --> 59:30.424
I'm on the corner
of Venice and Canal,

59:30.500 --> 59:32.764
and there's a whole lot
of people out front.

59:32.835 --> 59:35.099
- Please don't tell my dad!
- All right.

59:35.171 --> 59:37.605
No, just calm down.
I'm comin' to get you.

59:57.393 --> 59:59.327
I'm sorry.
I didn't know who else to call.

59:59.395 --> 01:00:00.623
It's cool.
What's goin' on?

01:00:00.697 --> 01:00:04.497
Hey, Sarah, what have
you been up to? Hee hee!

01:00:04.567 --> 01:00:05.898
Is that your boyfriend?

01:00:05.969 --> 01:00:08.130
No, he's not my boyfriend.

01:00:08.204 --> 01:00:10.502
I liked his friend, Mike,

01:00:10.573 --> 01:00:13.508
and we hung out a few times,
and he was always really nice,

01:00:13.576 --> 01:00:16.374
but then... all he wanted to
do tonight was have sex,

01:00:16.446 --> 01:00:18.471
I mean, he moved in
kind of rough, and...

01:00:18.548 --> 01:00:20.539
He got rough with you?
Where he at?

01:00:20.617 --> 01:00:22.551
He went back there
with that group.

01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:24.382
Go wait downstairs.

01:00:24.454 --> 01:00:25.978
Yo, Mike!

01:00:26.055 --> 01:00:28.353
Please, don't kill me!

01:00:28.424 --> 01:00:29.482
Oh, God!

01:00:29.559 --> 01:00:31.754
What are you? Crazy?!

01:00:31.828 --> 01:00:33.887
Pull me up!
What do you want?!

01:00:33.963 --> 01:00:34.895
Sarah!

01:00:34.964 --> 01:00:37.489
Mike has somethin'
to say to you.

01:00:37.567 --> 01:00:38.659
Say "sorry"!

01:00:38.735 --> 01:00:43.365
I-I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
God, I am sorry!

01:00:43.439 --> 01:00:44.497
Say "No means no."

01:00:44.574 --> 01:00:45.598
No means no!

01:00:48.478 --> 01:00:49.536
She was where?!

01:00:49.612 --> 01:00:51.170
Calm down. It's just...

01:00:51.247 --> 01:00:53.181
- She is 14!
- She's 15! Wait!

01:00:53.249 --> 01:00:54.546
G... well... oh!

01:00:54.617 --> 01:00:56.141
Look...

01:00:56.219 --> 01:00:58.050
Sarah don't need a warden.

01:00:58.121 --> 01:01:00.919
She needs her father...
you...

01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:02.617
so you can't get mad,
all right?

01:01:02.692 --> 01:01:05.024
You do it, she'll never
tell you anything again.

01:01:07.597 --> 01:01:09.861
All right.
I get it. I get it.

01:01:09.932 --> 01:01:13.595
Just be cool. Just play it cool,
you know what I mean?

01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:15.797
Just listen to her.
Let her do the talkin'.

01:01:16.873 --> 01:01:18.465
I am listening to you!

01:01:18.541 --> 01:01:19.872
Thank you.

01:01:22.078 --> 01:01:24.069
Don't trip.

01:01:25.448 --> 01:01:27.348
Don't trip.

01:01:33.623 --> 01:01:37.081
So...

01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:38.821
you went out with a boy...

01:01:38.895 --> 01:01:42.456
and he took you to a party,

01:01:42.532 --> 01:01:45.660
where kids were... drinking

01:01:45.735 --> 01:01:50.798
and "trippin' on E."...

01:01:50.873 --> 01:01:54.707
and then he took you
up to a room

01:01:54.777 --> 01:01:56.677
where he tried to...

01:01:56.746 --> 01:02:00.876
"get all up in that..."

01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:03.510
which he... didn't?

01:02:08.858 --> 01:02:11.258
And then Charlene came...

01:02:11.327 --> 01:02:15.263
in my new car...
and brought you home

01:02:15.364 --> 01:02:19.198
after first...
"bitchslapping" him.

01:02:24.607 --> 01:02:26.507
Well...

01:02:30.213 --> 01:02:32.477
...that was some night.

01:02:34.517 --> 01:02:35.541
Oh, Dad!

01:02:36.853 --> 01:02:39.219
I can't believe
you're not killing me!

01:02:39.288 --> 01:02:42.485
Oh! This is so great! I want
everything out in the open!

01:02:42.558 --> 01:02:46.016
Oh, I have so much more
to tell you!

01:04:20.790 --> 01:04:21.814
Kate, what are you doing here?

01:04:21.891 --> 01:04:24.121
W-What are you doing here?

01:04:24.193 --> 01:04:25.660
It's my shortcut home
from work.

01:04:25.728 --> 01:04:26.990
No, it's not.

01:04:27.063 --> 01:04:28.553
- Yes, it is.
- Is not.

01:04:28.631 --> 01:04:31.225
I thought you were
in the mountains.

01:04:32.301 --> 01:04:35.065
Well, yeah,
I-I came back early.

01:04:35.137 --> 01:04:38.368
There were bears that were
mauling the campers

01:04:38.441 --> 01:04:40.102
and eating them.

01:04:42.178 --> 01:04:43.270
Wow.

01:04:43.346 --> 01:04:46.440
But other than that...
nothing went wrong with your...

01:04:46.515 --> 01:04:47.846
Oh, no, no.
He's great.

01:04:47.917 --> 01:04:49.407
Yeah, I liked him.

01:04:51.754 --> 01:04:54.245
So, how's your...

01:04:54.323 --> 01:04:56.086
My what?

01:04:56.158 --> 01:04:57.716
Your life?

01:04:57.793 --> 01:05:00.523
Anything hip and new?

01:05:00.596 --> 01:05:02.154
No.

01:05:04.667 --> 01:05:06.191
Um...

01:05:06.269 --> 01:05:07.759
I'm having a good time
with the kids.

01:05:07.837 --> 01:05:09.429
Good. Glad you're having
fun with her.

01:05:10.273 --> 01:05:11.604
Them.

01:05:16.946 --> 01:05:18.345
What?

01:05:19.415 --> 01:05:20.905
You look, um...

01:05:20.983 --> 01:05:21.972
Yeah.

01:05:22.051 --> 01:05:23.143
Rested.

01:05:24.654 --> 01:05:26.713
Nice. You look nice.

01:05:26.789 --> 01:05:30.156
So, um, I guess I'll come by
later and pick up the kids.

01:05:30.226 --> 01:05:33.457
Oh, I was wondering if I could
keep them through Friday.

01:05:34.530 --> 01:05:36.862
Really?
You're not too busy?

01:05:36.933 --> 01:05:38.332
No.

01:05:40.670 --> 01:05:43.104
Well, yes, it's okay.

01:05:43.172 --> 01:05:45.538
It's wonderful, Peter.

01:05:45.608 --> 01:05:47.599
You know, if you wanted
to come ov...

01:05:54.116 --> 01:05:55.913
Go ahead.

01:05:55.985 --> 01:05:57.316
Sorry.

01:06:00.923 --> 01:06:02.185
Hello?

01:06:02.258 --> 01:06:04.055
Yo, get your butt home, dog.

01:06:04.126 --> 01:06:06.321
I will be home in my own
sweet time, girlfriend.

01:06:06.395 --> 01:06:09.228
You gotta come now. Arness said
she on her way over here.

01:06:09.298 --> 01:06:11.823
Oh, I forgot all about that.

01:06:11.901 --> 01:06:14.665
Oh, I'm sorry.
I-I have to go.

01:06:14.737 --> 01:06:16.136
I just forgot
about something,

01:06:16.205 --> 01:06:18.571
but I want to continue
this conversation,

01:06:18.641 --> 01:06:21.735
so I will call you, or you can
call me on my cell.

01:06:21.811 --> 01:06:22.869
Bye!

01:06:22.945 --> 01:06:23.877
Uh-huh.

01:06:55.077 --> 01:06:56.874
- Is she here yet?
- No!

01:06:56.946 --> 01:06:58.538
The place is a mess!

01:06:59.949 --> 01:07:01.780
e gotta clean this place up!

01:07:01.851 --> 01:07:03.842
Hey, get upstairs
and get ready!

01:07:03.919 --> 01:07:05.386
And what are you reading?!

01:07:05.454 --> 01:07:07.479
Get up there!
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:07:07.556 --> 01:07:09.524
Hey, yo, P.,
while we got this minute...

01:07:09.592 --> 01:07:11.890
there's somethin' I really
been meanin' to tell you...

01:07:11.961 --> 01:07:13.553
Well, you'll have to wait.

01:07:25.341 --> 01:07:27.070
Kids! She's here!

01:07:34.483 --> 01:07:36.280
Mrs. Arness?

01:07:36.352 --> 01:07:37.182
Oh!

01:07:37.253 --> 01:07:41.155
I'll get right to the point,
Mr. Sanderson.

01:07:41.223 --> 01:07:43.418
There are rumors circulating

01:07:43.492 --> 01:07:48.759
that your personal life
and your home are in disarray,

01:07:48.831 --> 01:07:51.527
and this makes me feel
very unsettled.

01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:53.795
I don't know who misinformed
you, but please, come in.

01:07:53.869 --> 01:07:55.928
I'd hate to think you're
under any misapprehension

01:07:56.005 --> 01:07:57.597
about me or my family.

01:07:59.375 --> 01:08:00.808
Sarah? Georgey?

01:08:00.876 --> 01:08:04.175
You remember Mrs. Arness?

01:08:04.246 --> 01:08:07.113
So lovely to see you again.

01:08:07.183 --> 01:08:09.014
Um, Father,
when you have a moment,

01:08:09.085 --> 01:08:12.885
would you mind helping me with
my report on Queen Victoria?

01:08:12.955 --> 01:08:14.616
Sure, kitten.

01:08:15.691 --> 01:08:18.524
And don't forget, Pop, tomorrow
you have to come to school

01:08:18.594 --> 01:08:20.788
and help hand out the food
to the poor kids.

01:08:20.863 --> 01:08:23.729
Have I ever forgotten
to help the poor kids?

01:08:23.799 --> 01:08:25.595
No, Pop. Never.

01:08:28.404 --> 01:08:32.738
In truth, Mr. Sanderson,
you have a lovely home.

01:08:32.808 --> 01:08:33.866
Thank you.

01:08:33.943 --> 01:08:36.138
And your children
are very well-behaved.

01:08:36.212 --> 01:08:38.077
They're angels.

01:08:38.147 --> 01:08:39.978
Oh, William.

01:08:40.049 --> 01:08:41.175
Oh, look!

01:08:41.250 --> 01:08:42.911
He's even taken a fancy
to your boy.

01:08:42.984 --> 01:08:44.316
That's so sweet.

01:08:44.386 --> 01:08:46.718
Anyway, we can go to the den
and get the contracts...

01:08:46.788 --> 01:08:48.779
What is that heavenly smell?

01:08:48.858 --> 01:08:51.656
Ah, that would be
Charlene preparing dinner.

01:08:51.727 --> 01:08:53.558
Anyway, the contracts...

01:08:53.629 --> 01:08:56.962
I haven't smelled home cooking
like that since I was a child.

01:08:57.032 --> 01:08:58.590
Really? Anyway...

01:08:58.667 --> 01:09:00.692
Brings back
such happy memories.

01:09:00.769 --> 01:09:04.227
Does it? Anyway, actually,
the den is closer...

01:09:04.305 --> 01:09:06.899
Your table looks so inviting.

01:09:06.975 --> 01:09:10.571
Yes. It's too bad
it's so small.

01:09:10.645 --> 01:09:12.045
Small?

01:09:12.113 --> 01:09:14.604
Well, actually,
it's big, isn't it?

01:09:14.683 --> 01:09:16.377
It's a big table, so...

01:09:16.452 --> 01:09:18.682
there would be room
for one more.

01:09:18.754 --> 01:09:21.518
Oh, well, if it's not
an imposition...

01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:22.886
Oh... oh.

01:09:22.957 --> 01:09:25.518
Well, let me just go check
if there's enough food.

01:09:25.594 --> 01:09:27.027
I'm not... I'm not sure,

01:09:27.095 --> 01:09:29.087
because, uh, actually,
this is the night of, uh,

01:09:29.165 --> 01:09:32.862
Yiminum, the, uh...
the holiday where

01:09:32.935 --> 01:09:34.765
white people eat
very little portions

01:09:34.837 --> 01:09:36.930
because that was the night
the Lord came down,

01:09:37.006 --> 01:09:38.166
and he was given food,

01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:40.470
and there was just too much,
and he said, "No."

01:09:40.542 --> 01:09:42.511
And so, he had
a smaller portion,

01:09:42.578 --> 01:09:44.738
and that's why we might not
have enough.

01:09:44.813 --> 01:09:47.782
So, I'll just go check on, uh,
what the Lord would say.

01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:50.216
Just one second.

01:09:50.286 --> 01:09:51.548
Come here, William.

01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:53.884
Hey, come here.
Are you hungry?

01:09:56.625 --> 01:09:57.785
Charlene...

01:09:57.860 --> 01:10:00.192
If there was ever a time
I needed a favor, it's now.

01:10:00.262 --> 01:10:01.593
You got it, baby.
Anything.

01:10:01.664 --> 01:10:03.097
Oh, thank you!

01:10:13.676 --> 01:10:15.200
Oh. Mrs. Arness?

01:10:15.277 --> 01:10:17.142
Yes? Oh, yes.

01:10:18.447 --> 01:10:21.177
My family and I are pleased
to invite you for dinner.

01:10:21.250 --> 01:10:22.308
Yeah, oh.

01:10:22.384 --> 01:10:24.443
Well, very well.
I wasn't expecting this.

01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:26.010
Uh, but if you insist.

01:10:26.088 --> 01:10:28.648
And then afterwards,
we can sign the contracts.

01:10:28.724 --> 01:10:29.520
Of course.

01:10:29.592 --> 01:10:31.457
Dinner is served.

01:10:32.928 --> 01:10:35.795
I was raised
in the South, you know.

01:10:35.864 --> 01:10:39.265
That smells just like
our Ivy's jambalaya.

01:10:39.335 --> 01:10:42.600
She was so wonderful.

01:10:42.671 --> 01:10:45.367
We paid her nothing,
of course, you know.

01:10:45.441 --> 01:10:48.501
But, then, people had standards
of service in those days.

01:10:48.577 --> 01:10:51.444
And, of course, Ivy did know

01:10:51.513 --> 01:10:56.541
that you serve from the left
and collect from the right.

01:10:59.722 --> 01:11:00.780
Don't...

01:11:00.856 --> 01:11:03.882
stop at that story, because
I love hearing about your past.

01:11:03.959 --> 01:11:05.290
That is fascinating.

01:11:07.630 --> 01:11:09.120
Oh, yes.

01:11:09.198 --> 01:11:11.166
Well, anyway,
as I was saying...

01:11:14.103 --> 01:11:16.128
Yeah.

01:11:16.205 --> 01:11:18.435
Yeah. Fast-actin'.

01:11:18.507 --> 01:11:20.202
Fast-actin'.

01:11:21.610 --> 01:11:23.737
Ooh, I'm gonna get you.

01:11:23.812 --> 01:11:25.746
I'm gonna get you.

01:11:25.814 --> 01:11:28.146
Uh-huh.
I'll serve your food right.

01:11:28.217 --> 01:11:30.151
Was it the left?
Was it the right?

01:11:30.219 --> 01:11:33.814
Father's work with the
Pasadena Republican Youth Group

01:11:33.889 --> 01:11:36.016
has truly been invaluable.

01:11:37.126 --> 01:11:39.356
I hope y'all brought
y'all appetites.

01:11:39.428 --> 01:11:41.055
Oh, yes.

01:11:41.130 --> 01:11:43.826
I brought mine.

01:11:43.899 --> 01:11:45.127
Oh, my goodness.

01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:47.100
This is much too much for me.

01:11:47.169 --> 01:11:49.228
I'll never get through
all that.

01:11:49.305 --> 01:11:51.364
I have a little less here.
I'll trade with you.

01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:52.429
Oh.

01:11:54.743 --> 01:11:57.041
Thank you.

01:11:59.281 --> 01:12:00.179
What, Charlene?

01:12:02.117 --> 01:12:03.175
Nothing, sir.

01:12:03.252 --> 01:12:05.345
Oh.

01:12:06.922 --> 01:12:08.253
Oh, this food
is so delicious.

01:12:08.324 --> 01:12:09.382
Serves him right, anyway,

01:12:09.458 --> 01:12:11.551
makin' me wear
this stinkin' outfit.

01:12:11.627 --> 01:12:13.788
You're very lucky to have found
such talented help.

01:12:16.198 --> 01:12:19.861
Well, our Ivy was with us
for so long,

01:12:19.935 --> 01:12:22.199
we really thought of her
as one of the family.

01:12:22.271 --> 01:12:23.203
Mmm.

01:12:23.272 --> 01:12:24.637
And after every meal,

01:12:24.707 --> 01:12:28.268
my mother would scrape
all the food we hadn't eaten

01:12:28.344 --> 01:12:31.575
and put it on one big plate
and give it to Ivy.

01:12:40.622 --> 01:12:41.953
Charlene...

01:12:42.024 --> 01:12:44.959
what is that
particular taste?

01:12:45.027 --> 01:12:46.995
It's familiar, yet...

01:12:47.062 --> 01:12:51.328
Is it some kind of herb
like sage?

01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:54.096
No, it's sort of more
like a milk of mint.

01:12:54.169 --> 01:12:57.696
Milk of... whatever it is,
the taste is explosive.

01:12:57.773 --> 01:12:58.762
Mmm.

01:12:58.841 --> 01:13:01.036
Well, good, then.

01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:03.237
Enjoy.

01:13:03.312 --> 01:13:05.075
Oh, just one moment.

01:13:05.147 --> 01:13:06.705
Uh, you know, uh,

01:13:06.782 --> 01:13:10.240
there's a lovely,
sad Negro spiritual...

01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:14.352
...that Ivy's brother used...

01:13:14.423 --> 01:13:15.617
Are you all right?

01:13:17.893 --> 01:13:20.123
Anyway, Ivy's brother
used to sing this

01:13:20.195 --> 01:13:24.029
when he came in
from the tobacco fields.

01:14:06.742 --> 01:14:08.972
Now, there's a second verse

01:14:09.044 --> 01:14:11.478
if you'd like to join
in the chorus.

01:14:38.507 --> 01:14:39.667
Dad?

01:14:39.741 --> 01:14:41.106
Are you okay?

01:14:54.723 --> 01:14:56.918
I hope your father's
all right.

01:14:56.992 --> 01:14:58.254
Does this happen often?

01:14:58.327 --> 01:15:00.761
Well, if you'll excuse us.

01:15:00.829 --> 01:15:02.126
Um...

01:15:02.197 --> 01:15:05.257
Georgey, let's go watch that
biography on Francis Drake.

01:15:08.670 --> 01:15:09.932
We... I mean,

01:15:10.005 --> 01:15:13.736
he seemed to be
so moved by that song.

01:15:13.809 --> 01:15:16.403
Oh, he movin', all right.

01:15:19.281 --> 01:15:20.942
- And tonight's top story...
- William?

01:15:21.016 --> 01:15:22.313
The FBI needs your help

01:15:22.384 --> 01:15:24.784
in finding fugitive at large
Charlene Morton.

01:15:24.853 --> 01:15:27.481
Charlene is an African-American
female, 31 years of age...

01:15:28.991 --> 01:15:30.083
What is it?

01:15:30.158 --> 01:15:31.853
...and 5'6", 175 pounds,

01:15:31.927 --> 01:15:33.895
with a tattoo
on her left breast.

01:15:33.962 --> 01:15:35.395
Convicted of armed robbery,

01:15:35.464 --> 01:15:37.989
Charlene is considered
cunning and highly dangerous.

01:15:39.535 --> 01:15:41.833
Having escaped from the Women's
Correctional Facility

01:15:41.904 --> 01:15:43.838
outside Los Angeles
a mere six days ago,

01:15:43.906 --> 01:15:45.840
Morton is suspected
to be armed.

01:15:45.908 --> 01:15:49.400
This bank surveillance tape
shows Charlene wielding a gun

01:15:49.478 --> 01:15:51.810
and holding a customer hostage.

01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:55.714
Charlene is considered dangerous
and may be armed.

01:15:55.784 --> 01:15:58.912
If you have any information
concerning Charlene Morton,

01:15:58.987 --> 01:16:01.979
please contact
your local FBI office.

01:16:02.057 --> 01:16:05.322
That's it for tonight's edition
of "Criminals at Large."

01:16:05.394 --> 01:16:08.090
Good night and be safe.

01:16:08.163 --> 01:16:10.927
Mrs. Arness,
I can explain everything.

01:16:17.072 --> 01:16:19.666
Pete, before you lose it,
just let me explain.

01:16:19.741 --> 01:16:21.003
There's nothing to say.

01:16:21.076 --> 01:16:22.475
But I didn't do it, Pete.

01:16:22.544 --> 01:16:23.806
You have to get out.

01:16:28.617 --> 01:16:30.642
All right.
I'll get my stuff.

01:16:54.109 --> 01:16:56.270
I don't understand.
You saw her and where is she?

01:16:56.345 --> 01:16:57.972
I don't know where she is.

01:16:58.046 --> 01:17:00.708
Don't drop the soap.

01:17:02.384 --> 01:17:03.612
What the hell does that mean?

01:17:03.685 --> 01:17:05.846
I just don't believe this.
I'm worried about her.

01:17:05.921 --> 01:17:07.980
I hate the fact that
she's out there all alone.

01:17:08.056 --> 01:17:10.422
You're worried about the poor,
innocent, frail creature

01:17:10.492 --> 01:17:12.687
who can hardly take care
of herself on the street?

01:17:12.761 --> 01:17:14.786
What about me?
Tobias is gonna fire me!

01:17:14.863 --> 01:17:15.887
And another goody...

01:17:15.964 --> 01:17:18.262
if Arness calls the cops,
I could go to jail!

01:17:18.333 --> 01:17:20.426
Here's the local number
for the Bureau.

01:17:20.502 --> 01:17:23.369
The FBI takes harboring
a fugitive very seriously.

01:17:23.438 --> 01:17:27.169
You, gentlemen, will be
the first to hear from me.

01:17:28.910 --> 01:17:30.878
Arness didn't call the cops,
she called the FBI.

01:17:30.946 --> 01:17:32.709
- Now, you haven't seen me.
- I have seen you.

01:17:32.781 --> 01:17:34.180
No, I mean,
you <i>haven't</i> seen me.

01:17:34.249 --> 01:17:36.149
I'm looking right at you.
What are you...

01:17:38.253 --> 01:17:39.686
If you do hear from her,

01:17:39.755 --> 01:17:43.657
please tell her the cool points
are out the window and...

01:17:43.725 --> 01:17:46.057
she's got me all twisted up
in the game.

01:17:58.674 --> 01:17:59.971
Why you messin' with Lene?

01:18:00.042 --> 01:18:02.067
I'm not messing with her,
I'm helping her.

01:18:02.144 --> 01:18:03.076
Bullshit!

01:18:04.613 --> 01:18:06.410
Uh! I'm telling you
the truth!

01:18:06.481 --> 01:18:08.881
Listen up.
You do not reopen this case.

01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:11.214
From now on,
I'm handlin' it for her.

01:18:11.286 --> 01:18:13.550
I'm not gonna reopen the case.
The case is closed.

01:18:13.622 --> 01:18:14.782
Stay out of her life.

01:18:16.024 --> 01:18:19.585
If I got to come back here,
things are gonna get bloody.

01:18:21.730 --> 01:18:24.631
Maybe I should
just finish this now.

01:18:35.977 --> 01:18:37.774
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:18:37.846 --> 01:18:39.279
We have to find Charlene.

01:18:39.347 --> 01:18:41.144
I thought you hated Charlene.

01:18:41.216 --> 01:18:42.615
I found out she's innocent.

01:18:42.684 --> 01:18:44.652
I knew it. I knew it.

01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:45.846
Where am I gonna find her?

01:18:45.921 --> 01:18:48.116
Well, you can call her.

01:18:48.190 --> 01:18:50.852
How can I call her
if I don't know where she is?

01:18:52.494 --> 01:18:55.861
I gave her your phone,
in case you might...

01:18:55.931 --> 01:18:58.422
You gave her my new
$600 titanium cellphone?

01:19:00.035 --> 01:19:01.525
Good idea. Come on.

01:19:01.603 --> 01:19:03.867
W-What happened to your head?

01:19:18.553 --> 01:19:21.454
Metropolitan Museum of Art.
How may I help you?

01:19:21.523 --> 01:19:22.683
I know who set you up.

01:19:22.758 --> 01:19:24.055
What?! Who?

01:19:30.232 --> 01:19:31.392
Get in.

01:19:35.437 --> 01:19:36.995
So, what's up?

01:19:37.072 --> 01:19:38.505
The guy points a gun to my head

01:19:38.573 --> 01:19:40.006
and tells me
not to reopen the case.

01:19:40.075 --> 01:19:41.508
I'm thinking,
"Why is he doing this?"

01:19:41.576 --> 01:19:44.807
And then it dawns on me...
it's because he was involved.

01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:46.142
God damn him.

01:19:46.214 --> 01:19:49.650
I can't believe
Widow did this to me.

01:19:49.718 --> 01:19:51.049
Where do you think he is?

01:19:51.119 --> 01:19:52.347
I don't know.

01:19:54.422 --> 01:19:56.890
Probably downtown
at this club he hang out at

01:19:56.958 --> 01:19:58.789
called the Down Low.

01:19:58.860 --> 01:20:00.418
Got to get a confession.

01:20:00.495 --> 01:20:03.123
You can't go there.

01:20:03.198 --> 01:20:04.790
Eh, man, I'm serious.

01:20:04.866 --> 01:20:06.834
A white man at the Down Low

01:20:06.902 --> 01:20:10.099
is either a cop, a corpse,
or a crackhead.

01:20:10.172 --> 01:20:12.037
You can't even talk 'hood.

01:20:12.107 --> 01:20:13.938
I'll figure out something.

01:20:14.009 --> 01:20:15.977
Oh, and Howie told me
to tell you

01:20:16.044 --> 01:20:18.979
that "The cool points
are out the window,

01:20:19.047 --> 01:20:22.210
and you got him
all twisted up in the game."

01:20:23.852 --> 01:20:25.251
Really?

01:20:26.621 --> 01:20:30.079
That's the nicest thing
anybody's ever said to me.

01:20:32.594 --> 01:20:33.856
I'm gonna drop you off here

01:20:33.929 --> 01:20:36.557
because I got to get to the
office for a conference call.

01:20:36.631 --> 01:20:38.292
So, I'll see you
in a little bit.

01:20:38.366 --> 01:20:40.357
All right. Okay, cool.

01:20:47.275 --> 01:20:50.108
Yeah, freak boy,
I need a ride.

01:20:50.178 --> 01:20:51.372
Can you come now?

01:20:54.449 --> 01:20:57.509
Damn.
A straight, cold pimp.

01:20:57.586 --> 01:21:00.146
Looks like Gendler
beat us to her.

01:21:02.490 --> 01:21:05.186
I can assure you, Mrs. Arness,

01:21:05.260 --> 01:21:07.660
Peter Sanderson
is no longer affiliated

01:21:07.729 --> 01:21:09.629
with Tobias, Kline, and Barnes.

01:21:09.698 --> 01:21:10.756
Good.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:13.490
You have great ankles.

01:21:13.568 --> 01:21:14.967
What?!

01:21:15.036 --> 01:21:17.004
Were you a dancer?

01:21:19.074 --> 01:21:22.339
Yeah... well, yes.
I was.

01:21:23.345 --> 01:21:24.676
I bet you had great presence.

01:21:28.149 --> 01:21:30.947
Oh. How you two doin'?

01:21:31.019 --> 01:21:33.180
I hope I'm not interruptin'
anything.

01:21:33.255 --> 01:21:34.415
You're nasty.

01:21:35.657 --> 01:21:37.181
W-What are you doing here?

01:21:37.259 --> 01:21:40.092
Please, Mrs. Arness, I'm not
here to cause any trouble.

01:21:40.161 --> 01:21:42.026
Well, that would be a first.

01:21:42.097 --> 01:21:43.587
Julia? Julia?

01:21:43.665 --> 01:21:46.293
Julia a little tied up
right now.

01:21:46.368 --> 01:21:47.995
I just need you
to hear me out.

01:21:48.069 --> 01:21:51.232
Peter is not responsible
for any of this. I am.

01:21:51.306 --> 01:21:53.240
I mean,
the guy is a great lawyer.

01:21:53.308 --> 01:21:56.277
And he's one of the most
decent men I've ever known.

01:21:56.344 --> 01:21:57.777
- I doubt that's saying much.
- Shut up, fool.

01:21:57.846 --> 01:22:01.077
If only you knew the lengths
he's willing to go to

01:22:01.149 --> 01:22:02.411
to help a friend.

01:22:02.484 --> 01:22:04.611
Listen... sister...

01:22:04.686 --> 01:22:06.483
"Sister"?

01:22:06.554 --> 01:22:08.681
Why don't you go back
to Sanderson,

01:22:08.757 --> 01:22:11.487
and the "Jungle Fever" thing
the two of you got goin' on,

01:22:11.559 --> 01:22:13.390
before I call the cops?

01:22:13.461 --> 01:22:14.985
That's it, pretty boy.

01:22:15.063 --> 01:22:16.621
You ever met the big hurt?

01:22:16.698 --> 01:22:18.563
The who?

01:22:22.437 --> 01:22:23.995
I wouldn't do that
if I were you!

01:22:24.072 --> 01:22:25.403
And why not?

01:22:25.473 --> 01:22:27.839
You'll be instantly returned
to prison, where you belong.

01:22:27.909 --> 01:22:29.001
All right. That's it.

01:22:29.077 --> 01:22:30.669
How dare you!

01:22:30.745 --> 01:22:32.110
To hell
with what I just said.

01:22:32.180 --> 01:22:33.875
You obviously
one of them hard learners.

01:22:33.949 --> 01:22:34.881
Howie?

01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:38.078
This is my house! I will not
be told to do what I...

01:22:41.222 --> 01:22:42.314
William.

01:22:49.097 --> 01:22:51.588
I'm Kate Sanderson.
Have you seen my kids?

01:22:51.666 --> 01:22:52.894
- Over there.
- Oh!

01:22:52.968 --> 01:22:53.900
Hey!

01:22:53.969 --> 01:22:55.163
Oh, God!

01:22:55.236 --> 01:22:57.397
What is going on?

01:22:57.472 --> 01:22:58.962
It's just the FBI, Mom.

01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:01.474
Yeah, they're just doing
a, like, search.

01:23:01.543 --> 01:23:02.601
For what?

01:23:02.677 --> 01:23:04.611
Well, for Charlene.
But she's not...

01:23:04.679 --> 01:23:06.544
The FBI is looking
for your nanny?

01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:23.593
Man, take your hands off me!

01:23:23.665 --> 01:23:25.257
I said, back off me, punk!

01:23:25.333 --> 01:23:27.767
That's what I mean.
You know what I'm sayin'?

01:23:27.836 --> 01:23:29.770
You don't want
none of this, now.

01:23:34.843 --> 01:23:36.538
Excuse me...

01:23:36.611 --> 01:23:37.805
Homeboys...

01:23:59.834 --> 01:24:03.634
Say, yo.
You got a bathroom in there?

01:24:14.916 --> 01:24:16.508
Say, yo, what's the dealio?

01:24:17.519 --> 01:24:20.181
Mmm. Who's your daddy?

01:24:21.089 --> 01:24:24.320
Back that booty up
and put it on the glass.

01:24:24.392 --> 01:24:26.451
Anybody here
dig what I'm sayin'?

01:24:30.432 --> 01:24:32.662
So...

01:24:32.734 --> 01:24:37.364
your nanny was doing time...

01:24:37.439 --> 01:24:39.839
for armed robbery.

01:24:41.076 --> 01:24:44.637
And then she broke out
of prison...

01:24:46.548 --> 01:24:49.813
...and then she came here.

01:24:52.887 --> 01:24:55.185
But she's innocent...

01:24:55.256 --> 01:24:58.919
and now your dad
has gone off to...

01:24:58.993 --> 01:25:00.688
help her.

01:25:02.430 --> 01:25:04.125
Sounds crazy, right?

01:25:04.199 --> 01:25:06.030
He's not the same guy anymore.

01:25:07.402 --> 01:25:08.699
Yeah, he's really cool.

01:25:10.772 --> 01:25:13.673
Say, any of you homies
holdin' extra Jimmy High?

01:25:13.741 --> 01:25:17.905
'Cause I'm all about crunchin'
some of that <i>boofanny</i> tonight.

01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:22.716
If you harm one hair
on that dog's head...

01:25:22.784 --> 01:25:25.378
Yeah, "Harm a hair on the head."
You got me all nervous.

01:25:25.453 --> 01:25:26.545
Hello?

01:25:26.621 --> 01:25:28.145
- Sarah?
- Oh, hey, Charlene.

01:25:28.823 --> 01:25:29.847
Put your daddy on the phone.

01:25:29.924 --> 01:25:32.415
No, he's not here.
He went out to find you.

01:25:32.494 --> 01:25:33.859
He went to find me?!

01:25:33.928 --> 01:25:35.020
Tsk. All right.

01:25:36.498 --> 01:25:38.398
Howie, flip a "U."
We headed downtown.

01:25:38.466 --> 01:25:40.093
Downtown's where I live,
precious.

01:25:40.168 --> 01:25:41.601
No! No!

01:25:41.669 --> 01:25:42.829
Whoa!

01:25:44.172 --> 01:25:45.730
What's on your mind, player?

01:25:45.807 --> 01:25:48.435
What's with you? You been
drinkin' some "Hatorade"?

01:25:48.510 --> 01:25:50.637
What's up, Flavor?
Where you from?

01:25:50.712 --> 01:25:53.340
From the 'hood
and misunderstood.

01:25:54.849 --> 01:25:57.181
- How's your pimp hand, dog?
- Strong, baby, strong.

01:26:00.522 --> 01:26:01.716
Can you swerve, snowman?

01:26:01.789 --> 01:26:03.814
Do I got "honky"
spray-painted on my forehead?

01:26:03.892 --> 01:26:05.883
Of course I can.
I'm tryin' to peep a bowwow.

01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:08.121
If you so at home, man,
then dance with the woman.

01:26:08.196 --> 01:26:09.322
I can't. I got b'ness.

01:26:09.397 --> 01:26:11.160
Go on out there
and get your groove on.

01:26:11.232 --> 01:26:13.496
No, I can't. I got important
b'ness to take care of.

01:26:13.568 --> 01:26:14.660
Yeah.

01:26:19.274 --> 01:26:20.605
I tell you, but...

01:27:44.959 --> 01:27:46.950
You'll get a life sentence
for this.

01:27:47.028 --> 01:27:48.825
You're a kidnapper
and a whore!

01:27:48.896 --> 01:27:51.194
Hey.
Keep talkin', tea bag.

01:27:51.266 --> 01:27:52.824
Ooh?! Tea bag!

01:27:52.900 --> 01:27:54.868
Yeah, you'll be gummin'
your bubbles.

01:27:54.936 --> 01:27:56.494
Yeah, oh! Terrible.

01:28:35.009 --> 01:28:38.501
Damn, boy, you lookin'
all kind of stupid.

01:28:38.579 --> 01:28:40.240
Really?

01:28:40.315 --> 01:28:42.749
'Cause I got this outfit
from your mama.

01:28:44.419 --> 01:28:46.353
Yo, Eminem,
cut the wigger shit.

01:28:46.421 --> 01:28:48.685
I don't think you know
how much trouble you in.

01:28:48.756 --> 01:28:51.281
Fine, fine, fine.

01:28:51.359 --> 01:28:53.452
I'm here to talk business...

01:28:53.528 --> 01:28:54.859
private business.

01:28:59.067 --> 01:29:00.967
What fresh air is this?

01:29:01.035 --> 01:29:02.593
I don't see him anywhere.

01:29:02.670 --> 01:29:05.400
I think he's in that back room
over there.

01:29:05.473 --> 01:29:07.338
What do we do
with Her Majesty?

01:29:07.408 --> 01:29:08.340
Sit down.

01:29:08.409 --> 01:29:09.341
What?

01:29:09.410 --> 01:29:11.776
Sit it on down.

01:29:11.846 --> 01:29:13.746
Now, look, if you move,

01:29:13.815 --> 01:29:15.976
your little Willy
gonna be bridged down.

01:29:16.050 --> 01:29:17.984
- You dig?
- Dig.

01:29:18.052 --> 01:29:20.247
All right. Come on.

01:29:21.322 --> 01:29:22.380
Is that real?

01:29:22.457 --> 01:29:23.617
Oh.

01:29:24.625 --> 01:29:26.991
Uh, Seven and Seven, double.

01:29:29.931 --> 01:29:31.421
How you doin'?

01:29:31.499 --> 01:29:32.864
What?!

01:29:32.934 --> 01:29:35.402
I said, "How you doin'?"

01:29:35.470 --> 01:29:36.801
Oh, fantastic.

01:29:41.242 --> 01:29:44.302
You either the dumbest cracker
I ever met or you straight up...

01:29:44.379 --> 01:29:46.313
Hold that thought.
I love this song.

01:29:52.854 --> 01:29:53.650
Turn that off.

01:29:58.025 --> 01:30:00.289
Get everybody up out of here.

01:30:03.531 --> 01:30:06.125
I'm telling you,
he is definitely in there.

01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:07.963
Okay, all right,
so he's in there,

01:30:08.035 --> 01:30:10.162
and then <i>you</i> go in,
and then what happens?

01:30:11.305 --> 01:30:12.431
Three seconds.

01:30:12.507 --> 01:30:14.634
Why you here?

01:30:14.709 --> 01:30:17.701
I got a feeling you're sitting
on a hefty sum of stolen cash.

01:30:17.779 --> 01:30:19.804
You want to hide it,
you need a lawyer.

01:30:19.881 --> 01:30:20.939
What's with the phone?

01:30:21.015 --> 01:30:22.448
I'm calling in the cavalry.

01:30:22.517 --> 01:30:23.882
You'll go back to prison.

01:30:23.951 --> 01:30:26.181
So you wanna help me
launder my money?

01:30:26.254 --> 01:30:27.983
I can hide it
in an untraceable account

01:30:28.055 --> 01:30:29.386
in the Cayman Islands.

01:30:29.457 --> 01:30:30.856
All I want is $ 100,000.

01:30:30.925 --> 01:30:33.450
We both walk out of here
wealthier men.

01:30:33.528 --> 01:30:36.793
<i>And</i> I tell you where
Charlene is... that simple.

01:30:38.866 --> 01:30:40.697
You wearin' a wire?

01:30:40.768 --> 01:30:42.565
Me?

01:30:42.637 --> 01:30:43.968
No. Are you?

01:30:45.206 --> 01:30:47.674
Then...
then they kidnapped me.

01:30:47.742 --> 01:30:50.142
And they took my dog,
William.

01:30:50.211 --> 01:30:51.576
That's a damn shame.

01:30:55.983 --> 01:30:58.451
Oh, you don't care.

01:30:58.519 --> 01:31:00.282
You smokin', Grandma?

01:31:03.224 --> 01:31:04.384
Why not?

01:31:14.769 --> 01:31:16.168
To hell with your proposition.

01:31:16.237 --> 01:31:18.831
Hold it. Charlene is ready
to roll over on you.

01:31:18.906 --> 01:31:20.874
She knows
who your accomplice was.

01:31:20.942 --> 01:31:22.933
- Oh, that's pretty funny.
- I'm not kidding.

01:31:23.010 --> 01:31:25.410
They're out in the parking lot
waiting for my signal and...

01:31:25.480 --> 01:31:27.414
and... and...
and the signal is...

01:31:27.482 --> 01:31:29.575
if I don't come back,
they call the FBI.

01:31:29.650 --> 01:31:31.083
There was no accomplice, fool.

01:31:31.152 --> 01:31:33.211
There was a girl in the photo.

01:31:33.287 --> 01:31:35.278
No, there was somebody
in a wig and a dress.

01:31:36.457 --> 01:31:38.448
You...

01:31:38.526 --> 01:31:41.393
You left her clothes,
the gun, and the money.

01:31:42.897 --> 01:31:44.057
See?

01:31:44.131 --> 01:31:46.361
You just too damn smart
for your own good.

01:31:53.674 --> 01:31:55.369
Look, we can't wait no more.

01:31:55.443 --> 01:31:56.808
Wait, wait. Charlene!

01:31:56.878 --> 01:31:58.470
Open up.
Widow wanna see me.

01:31:58.546 --> 01:31:59.478
Says who?

01:31:59.547 --> 01:32:00.707
Says Lene.

01:32:02.450 --> 01:32:03.144
Pete.

01:32:03.217 --> 01:32:05.583
Well, ain't this
a psychic moment?

01:32:05.653 --> 01:32:07.018
I was just comin' to see you.

01:32:07.088 --> 01:32:09.318
Come on, Widow.
This is between me and you.

01:32:09.390 --> 01:32:10.322
Let him go.

01:32:10.391 --> 01:32:11.722
No problem.

01:32:11.792 --> 01:32:12.986
Ugh!

01:32:13.561 --> 01:32:14.721
Oh, shit.

01:32:14.795 --> 01:32:17.320
What... come on, now.
What are you doin'?

01:32:17.398 --> 01:32:18.456
Ugh!

01:32:18.533 --> 01:32:20.057
I got it.

01:32:20.134 --> 01:32:22.762
- Aim it, aim it, Howie!
- Yeah!

01:32:22.837 --> 01:32:25.806
Uh-huh!
Who got the gun now, huh?

01:32:25.873 --> 01:32:28.603
Who got that gun now?
Homie, that's right.

01:32:28.676 --> 01:32:30.303
Get y'all asses
on the ground!

01:32:30.378 --> 01:32:32.403
Asses on the ground
where I can see 'em, huh?

01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:33.504
Take him out!

01:32:42.690 --> 01:32:43.782
Pussies.

01:32:46.093 --> 01:32:47.424
Ooh!

01:32:50.097 --> 01:32:51.462
- Ugh!
- Ooh.

01:32:52.567 --> 01:32:54.091
Ugh!

01:32:58.673 --> 01:33:00.698
Wasn't that fun?

01:33:00.775 --> 01:33:03.243
I'm just gonna roll up
on out of here.

01:33:03.311 --> 01:33:05.506
Thank you.

01:33:16.023 --> 01:33:17.854
- Aah!
- FBI!

01:33:17.925 --> 01:33:19.290
Everybody, freeze!

01:33:20.394 --> 01:33:23.363
Charlene! Charlene!
Oh, baby!

01:33:23.431 --> 01:33:25.194
Oh, oh, baby.

01:33:25.266 --> 01:33:27.131
Charlene.

01:33:27.201 --> 01:33:28.566
Son of a...

01:33:29.904 --> 01:33:30.996
Drop it!

01:33:34.742 --> 01:33:36.676
Oh, Charlene.

01:33:39.213 --> 01:33:40.703
What?

01:33:40.781 --> 01:33:42.043
Damn, dog.

01:33:50.625 --> 01:33:52.092
Hey, Howie, she's all right.

01:33:54.161 --> 01:33:55.355
Charlene...

01:33:55.429 --> 01:33:56.487
I...

01:33:56.564 --> 01:33:58.896
Do me a favor, precious.

01:33:58.966 --> 01:34:00.797
Don't ever scare me
like that again,

01:34:00.868 --> 01:34:03.200
or I'm gonna have to give you
a nasty spanking,

01:34:03.270 --> 01:34:05.568
if I'm not being too subtle.

01:34:06.974 --> 01:34:09.169
He's such a damn freak.

01:34:10.244 --> 01:34:11.336
Are you Sanderson?

01:34:11.412 --> 01:34:12.208
Yeah.

01:34:13.014 --> 01:34:14.606
Wait, wait.
She's innocent.

01:34:14.682 --> 01:34:16.149
Save it.

01:34:16.217 --> 01:34:18.048
I can prove it.

01:34:27.161 --> 01:34:29.789
Mr. Sanderson...
that was pretty ballsy.

01:34:29.864 --> 01:34:31.456
You'd make a hell of an agent.

01:34:31.532 --> 01:34:34.057
Oh, thank you very much,
but I don't think I did anything

01:34:34.135 --> 01:34:37.298
- an ordinary man wouldn't do...
- Thanks again.

01:34:37.371 --> 01:34:39.737
Mr. Sanderson...

01:34:39.807 --> 01:34:40.967
There you are.

01:34:41.042 --> 01:34:45.069
You have behaved abonidably.

01:34:45.146 --> 01:34:47.444
Aboni...

01:34:47.515 --> 01:34:49.278
Abomidably.

01:34:49.350 --> 01:34:51.409
- Abodi...
- Abominably.

01:34:51.485 --> 01:34:53.612
I know.

01:34:53.688 --> 01:34:54.814
- Shakespeare.
- Shakespeare.

01:34:54.889 --> 01:34:56.117
No, wait.
This is serious.

01:34:56.190 --> 01:34:58.090
And I'll have you dis...

01:34:58.159 --> 01:34:59.387
disboweled.

01:35:00.828 --> 01:35:03.888
Uh, disballed.

01:35:03.964 --> 01:35:06.262
Dis...

01:35:06.333 --> 01:35:07.925
Disbarred?

01:35:08.002 --> 01:35:10.163
Disbarred.

01:35:10.237 --> 01:35:12.068
Oh, to hell with it.

01:35:12.139 --> 01:35:14.733
I do believe I'm stoned.

01:35:14.809 --> 01:35:19.610
Just don't tell anybody
you ever saw me like this.

01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:20.738
Mrs. Arness...

01:35:20.815 --> 01:35:22.112
William.

01:35:22.183 --> 01:35:24.117
Oh, God,
you are an ugly dog...

01:35:24.185 --> 01:35:25.277
and heavy.

01:35:25.352 --> 01:35:26.785
Here, I got him.

01:35:26.854 --> 01:35:28.116
Thank you.

01:35:28.189 --> 01:35:31.750
Is there a 24-hour diner
around here?

01:35:31.826 --> 01:35:33.953
I know where one is.
I'll take you there.

01:35:34.028 --> 01:35:35.427
I'm dreadfully hungry.

01:35:35.496 --> 01:35:36.463
You guys okay?

01:35:36.530 --> 01:35:37.497
What do you think?

01:35:37.565 --> 01:35:39.465
Yo, be cool, G-mo.

01:35:39.533 --> 01:35:41.125
Yo, out back, G-mo.

01:35:41.202 --> 01:35:43.568
Full cheesy, homey.

01:35:48.676 --> 01:35:50.007
Well, that's not good enough.

01:35:50.277 --> 01:35:52.438
You'll just have to keep
trying, won't you?

01:35:52.513 --> 01:35:54.640
I called Arness four times.
She'll only talk to Peter.

01:35:54.715 --> 01:35:56.615
Well, we're just gonna
have to keep him around.

01:35:56.684 --> 01:35:57.708
Oh, hey, guys.

01:35:57.785 --> 01:35:59.047
Peter.

01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:01.213
Did I mention
I'm going out on my own?

01:36:01.288 --> 01:36:03.950
You don't have the resources.

01:36:04.024 --> 01:36:07.460
Well, I have one
multibillion-dollar client.

01:36:07.528 --> 01:36:09.052
It's a start.

01:36:09.130 --> 01:36:10.256
And a partner.

01:36:10.331 --> 01:36:11.798
I'm all over it, G.

01:36:11.866 --> 01:36:12.890
Let's go.

01:36:12.967 --> 01:36:14.161
Excuse me.

01:36:15.870 --> 01:36:18.532
Peter,
we can talk about this.

01:36:18.606 --> 01:36:23.475
Ed, you can
kiss my natural black ass.

01:36:29.750 --> 01:36:30.739
Peter...

01:36:30.818 --> 01:36:32.445
Ashley,
who are you doing here?

01:36:32.520 --> 01:36:35.387
Oh, I was, uh, meeting,
uh, uh...

01:36:35.456 --> 01:36:37.481
- for my aunt's estate.
- About her aunt's estate.

01:36:37.558 --> 01:36:38.991
There was a codicil.

01:36:39.059 --> 01:36:41.527
Well, say goodbye
to half your stuff.

01:36:44.365 --> 01:36:46.094
I'll call you.

01:37:21.168 --> 01:37:23.693
Lookin' good, kids.
Almost there.

01:37:23.771 --> 01:37:27.104
Peter, your 4:00 is waiting
for you in your office.

01:37:27.174 --> 01:37:29.199
I don't have
any meetings today.

01:37:29.276 --> 01:37:32.302
I'm sorry. I didn't realize
I had an appointment.

01:37:33.647 --> 01:37:34.671
Hey.

01:37:34.748 --> 01:37:38.047
So, this is how a big-time
tax attorney lives, huh?

01:37:38.118 --> 01:37:40.814
This place is big pimpin',
P. Diddy.

01:37:40.888 --> 01:37:42.913
- How you doin'?
- I'm a'ight.

01:37:44.458 --> 01:37:46.255
I really wanted
to tell you again

01:37:46.327 --> 01:37:48.318
how much I appreciate
what you did for me.

01:37:49.897 --> 01:37:53.060
If I could only give you back
half of what you've given me.

01:37:53.133 --> 01:37:55.658
Please. We'll call it even.
Now give me a hug.

01:37:55.736 --> 01:37:57.226
Hey, white people don't hug.

01:37:57.304 --> 01:37:58.362
You ain't white.

01:37:58.439 --> 01:37:59.770
Well, I'm off-white.

01:38:01.075 --> 01:38:02.474
Good to see you.

01:38:05.746 --> 01:38:06.770
Kate...

01:38:06.847 --> 01:38:08.178
Hi.

01:38:10.217 --> 01:38:12.879
Um, oh, well, I'm, uh...

01:38:12.953 --> 01:38:15.444
I got to finish up
some things with Howie.

01:38:17.825 --> 01:38:20.794
Oh, Kate, this is Charlene.
Charlene, this is Kate.

01:38:22.696 --> 01:38:25.756
Hi. You've certainly been
shaking things up around here.

01:38:27.334 --> 01:38:29.495
Well, shakin'
is what I do best.

01:38:31.238 --> 01:38:33.263
It's a pleasure
to meet you, Kate.

01:38:33.340 --> 01:38:35.001
Thank you.

01:38:35.075 --> 01:38:38.203
And take care of him for me.

01:38:44.218 --> 01:38:45.207
Hi.

01:38:45.286 --> 01:38:46.878
Hi.

01:38:48.455 --> 01:38:50.514
So...

01:38:50.591 --> 01:38:52.559
what...
what brings you down?

01:38:52.626 --> 01:38:55.151
I mean, you know,
not what brings you down,

01:38:55.229 --> 01:38:57.891
but, I mean,
what brings you down here?

01:39:00.100 --> 01:39:03.558
Well, I was
just wondering, um...

01:39:03.637 --> 01:39:06.470
how often do you take
that shortcut past my house?

01:39:08.142 --> 01:39:09.302
Technically?

01:39:09.376 --> 01:39:11.674
Uh, well...

01:39:11.745 --> 01:39:13.576
uh, pretty much every day.

01:39:16.483 --> 01:39:19.008
Well, you know,
technically...

01:39:21.155 --> 01:39:23.123
That's stalking.

01:39:25.459 --> 01:39:27.188
It's kind of cute.

01:39:29.797 --> 01:39:31.355
Kate...

01:39:32.967 --> 01:39:35.094
There's something
I want to say to you.

01:39:41.208 --> 01:39:43.472
The cool points
are out the window,

01:39:43.544 --> 01:39:45.535
and I'm all twisted up
in the game.

01:39:47.915 --> 01:39:50.213
What does that mean?

01:39:50.284 --> 01:39:51.376
It means I love you.

01:40:19.546 --> 01:40:21.571
Rastaman, hold still,
or you're gonna have

01:40:21.648 --> 01:40:23.582
these Jamaican beads
all over the floor.

01:40:23.650 --> 01:40:25.675
Yeah, here we go.

01:40:25.753 --> 01:40:27.277
All right, halfway done.

01:40:28.555 --> 01:40:30.045
What you think?

01:40:31.792 --> 01:40:33.521
Holler at your boy.

01:40:34.928 --> 01:40:36.452
- Hey.
- Nothin' is nothin'.

01:40:36.530 --> 01:40:38.828
Who's your daddy now?

01:40:38.899 --> 01:40:41.800
Boy, you are some kind
of freaky.
