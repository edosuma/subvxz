WEBVTT

00:11.455 --> 00:14.128
No, no, no.
I only just talked to the realtor.

00:14.357 --> 00:15.467
Yeah, I know that, Kitty,

00:15.468 --> 00:16.751
but I've had the house ten years

00:16.752 --> 00:18.147
so I've gotta have
some equity in it.

00:18.148 --> 00:19.748
Look, I know you like this one,

00:19.828 --> 00:22.116
and Hans wants me to put
one more in the show.

00:22.612 --> 00:25.003
I don't know, honey.
I've never been naked in public before.

00:25.004 --> 00:27.924
- I don't know if I can part with it.
- Listen, honey, I gotta go

00:27.925 --> 00:30.563
because the artist needs his muse.

00:31.604 --> 00:32.287
I don't know.

00:32.287 --> 00:34.612
They might all be sold out
by the time you get back.

00:34.613 --> 00:38.520
- Sold out? I'll be lucky if I sell
one painting. - Oh, stop that.

00:38.533 --> 00:39.374
Listen, if you want one,

00:39.375 --> 00:41.486
I'll put one aside
for Evan's room, okay?

00:42.021 --> 00:44.629
All right. Will do. Bye.

00:45.593 --> 00:46.960
Kitty says "good luck."

00:46.961 --> 00:48.232
Well, I'm gonna need it.

00:48.570 --> 00:50.795
Listen, you've gotta
stop it with this...

00:50.796 --> 00:54.236
This charming French
self-deprecating thing.

00:54.664 --> 00:56.055
Americans don't understand it,

00:56.056 --> 00:58.020
especially rich ones who buy art.

00:58.021 --> 00:59.610
Hmm.
Did you really call the realtor?

00:59.611 --> 01:01.920
Mm-hmm.
I told you about her, right?

01:01.921 --> 01:03.976
She's... she's fabulous.

01:03.977 --> 01:05.675
She should have her own reality show.

01:05.676 --> 01:06.896
The market is so bad, isn't it?

01:06.897 --> 01:08.188
Exactly. Exactly.

01:08.189 --> 01:10.639
You see, you sell an asset
you have equity in,

01:10.640 --> 01:12.431
you leverage up to a bigger asset,

01:12.432 --> 01:15.121
market goes up, everyone wins.

01:15.365 --> 01:16.118
Totally lost me.

01:16.119 --> 01:17.991
Mm-hmm. So trust me.

01:19.760 --> 01:21.808
I'm not sure if it's the right time
for us, though.

01:22.069 --> 01:24.511
No, come on.
The company's doing well.

01:24.512 --> 01:26.548
Paige is a teenager,
Cooper soon will be.

01:26.549 --> 01:28.294
They're gonna need
a lot more space.

01:28.472 --> 01:32.379
Besides, I happen to know
a very talented artist

01:32.380 --> 01:35.348
whose career is on the way up.

01:35.776 --> 01:37.856
And he's gonna need
a bigger studio...

01:38.312 --> 01:41.763
Higher ceilings, maybe a skylight.

01:41.764 --> 01:42.415
Mm. Feels so good.

01:42.416 --> 01:44.687
I'll just get the realtor in.
She'll do an appraisal.

01:44.688 --> 01:46.817
And we'll take it from there, okay?

01:49.988 --> 01:51.892
- Oh, it's the gallery.
- Okay.

01:52.509 --> 01:55.544
- Oh, my gosh.
- Hey, Hans. Really?

01:56.013 --> 01:58.124
Whoa. The "Times"
wants to do a profile on me.

01:58.814 --> 01:59.675
That's fantastic.

01:59.676 --> 02:02.380
You tell them that you are
the next big thing.

02:02.691 --> 02:06.078
Hey, Hans. Oh, no. I... I...
I think I found the painting.

02:06.079 --> 02:07.676
I'm gonna bring it tomorrow.

02:10.292 --> 02:12.279
Okay, this is the hard...
this is the hardest one of all. Yeah.

02:12.280 --> 02:13.616
He's a British soccer player.

02:13.617 --> 02:15.366
- He just played in L.A.
- David Beckham.

02:15.367 --> 02:17.315
- Yeah! - How do you even
know that, mom?

02:17.316 --> 02:19.082
Well, you don't have
to be a soccer fan or gay

02:19.083 --> 02:23.204
- to know who David Beckham is.
- Okay, okay, this guy is a painter.

02:23.205 --> 02:26.299
- A painter. - He's American and
he made weird movies, too.

02:26.300 --> 02:29.039
- H... he painted soup cans.
- Andy Warhol.

02:29.040 --> 02:31.632
Nice! Okay.

02:31.968 --> 02:35.072
Uh, ooh. Um... mm.

02:35.723 --> 02:37.467
Well, if... if you don't know
his name, you can use

02:37.468 --> 02:37.884
somebody else
who has the same first name.

02:37.885 --> 02:39.621
Stop helping them.
They're killing us.

02:39.622 --> 02:42.932
- I know who it is. That's not
the problem. This... - Ten...

02:43.681 --> 02:45.828
- Nine...
- He's a singer.

02:45.829 --> 02:47.975
- Eight...
- He's got a really crazy name.

02:47.976 --> 02:49.854
- Seven...
- Englebert Humperdinck!

02:49.855 --> 02:51.057
Yeah!

02:52.280 --> 02:54.599
- I don't know how I knew it.
- Oh, you pronounced it right, too.

02:54.600 --> 02:55.983
All right, next time
we're splitting you up.

02:55.984 --> 02:57.612
- Couples can't play together.
- You know what?

02:57.613 --> 02:58.799
We're winning
because we're good,

02:58.800 --> 03:02.463
not because we're a couple,
and we're not a couple anyway.

03:02.504 --> 03:04.340
- I think it's safe to say
we're dating, Nora. - You know what?

03:04.341 --> 03:06.682
It's not safe to say anything
around these guys.

03:06.683 --> 03:08.817
They'll misrepresent it
and misconstrue it

03:08.818 --> 03:11.104
and then use it against you later.

03:11.396 --> 03:13.540
You're worried about us?
What about the neighbors?

03:13.541 --> 03:16.199
- You've had a large winnebago parked
in your driveway for... - Kevin.

03:16.200 --> 03:17.623
- You want me to...
- Ooh. Hey.

03:17.624 --> 03:19.307
You want me to park it
down the block?

03:19.308 --> 03:20.779
That's a long walk home
every night,

03:20.780 --> 03:22.336
- Kevin.
- You don't let him stay over, mom?

03:22.337 --> 03:24.998
Would you... my God,
this is none of your business.

03:24.999 --> 03:27.079
And, no, not even a nap.

03:27.080 --> 03:28.415
Well, what the hell
are you guys waiting for?

03:28.416 --> 03:29.072
I mean, you've already been

03:29.073 --> 03:30.919
- there and done that.
- Hold it there, tiger.

03:30.920 --> 03:33.123
Justin. Well, I-I meant with each other,

03:33.124 --> 03:34.439
or Sarah wouldn't have thought

03:34.440 --> 03:35.363
that he might be
her father, for God sakes.

03:35.364 --> 03:36.879
All right. That's it. Game's over.

03:36.880 --> 03:38.374
Thank you so much for coming.

03:38.375 --> 03:39.816
I think I'll get another beer.

03:41.612 --> 03:42.771
What is your problem?

03:42.772 --> 03:44.532
What's the matter with you?

03:44.608 --> 03:47.312
You're making both of us
very uncomfortable.

03:47.341 --> 03:50.743
Mom, relax. It's okay.
He's... he's clearly in love with you.

03:50.744 --> 03:53.514
Would you stop?
My God. It's none of your b...

03:54.453 --> 03:55.844
How do you know
he's in love with me?

03:55.845 --> 03:58.358
- Oh, come on.
- Ma, he's clearly in love with you.

03:59.905 --> 04:00.993
You know what?

04:01.224 --> 04:03.730
I am furious with your husband

04:03.731 --> 04:05.687
for taking Olivia off to get ice cream.

04:05.688 --> 04:07.775
I made a cake.
All the kids love my cake.

04:07.776 --> 04:10.475
You didn't make a cake.
You made a viennese dobos torte.

04:10.476 --> 04:11.896
The name alone scared her off,

04:11.897 --> 04:15.864
- and stop changing the subject.
- All right. All right.

04:16.579 --> 04:17.588
All right.

04:18.652 --> 04:21.091
I like him... quite a lot.

04:21.091 --> 04:22.107
Ooh.

04:22.108 --> 04:24.512
Shh. Oh, Justin, grow up.

04:24.692 --> 04:27.925
If you two would
just please back off...

04:28.064 --> 04:30.447
who knows where this might go.

04:31.056 --> 04:33.325
- Consider us backed off.
- So backing.

04:38.904 --> 04:40.891
I think grandma
was mad when we left.

04:40.892 --> 04:42.307
Mm, I don't think so.

04:42.308 --> 04:44.029
And even if she was,
it is worth it...

04:44.365 --> 04:47.149
because this ice cream is awesome.

04:47.368 --> 04:49.336
Don't tell her that I ordered cake batter.

04:49.515 --> 04:50.939
You know, this chocolate-peanut butter

04:50.940 --> 04:53.516
- is pretty good, too.
- Wanna switch?

04:53.829 --> 04:55.141
Totes.

05:00.536 --> 05:01.577
Michelle?

05:03.283 --> 05:04.400
Scotty.

05:04.401 --> 05:06.419
Oh, my God. What are you doing here?
I can't believe it.

05:06.420 --> 05:10.164
- Uh, I... I was just in town
for a few days. - Why didn't you call?

05:11.061 --> 05:12.520
I was visiting my mom,

05:12.521 --> 05:14.355
d d I-I'm only here for a few days,

05:14.356 --> 05:16.039
so I didn't really have time to.

05:16.040 --> 05:18.705
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah. You know how moms are.

05:18.706 --> 05:21.330
They don't see you for a while,
they... they freak out.

05:21.380 --> 05:24.638
- I... I wish I could talk, but I really...
I actu... - Hi, I'm Olivia.

05:24.639 --> 05:27.016
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry. This is, um,

05:27.017 --> 05:29.016
this is our daughter Olivia.

05:30.437 --> 05:31.122
Your daughter?

05:31.123 --> 05:33.272
Yeah. I didn't know you guys...

05:33.273 --> 05:35.259
- They adopted me.
- You know,

05:35.260 --> 05:37.485
I have known Michelle
since I was about your age.

05:37.965 --> 05:39.391
Scotty, I've gotta go.

05:39.392 --> 05:40.960
You know, Olivia,
I just remembered,

05:40.961 --> 05:44.357
Kevin asked for us to get him
a pint of mint chocolate chip.

05:44.358 --> 05:46.632
- Would you get us one to go?
- Sure.

05:47.276 --> 05:50.335
You guys want to talk. I get it. Thank you.

05:50.336 --> 05:53.288
Scotty, listen, I know that
you want to talk and everything,

05:53.289 --> 05:55.816
- but I... I can't do th...
- Michelle, seriously, where have you been?

05:56.488 --> 05:58.264
It's like you dropped off
the face of the planet.

06:00.137 --> 06:02.856
It's New York.
It's... it's intense.

06:03.704 --> 06:06.280
Michelle, we don't blame you
in any way for what happened.

06:06.541 --> 06:09.020
We knew that when you offered
to be our surrogate that...

06:09.292 --> 06:11.731
- that miscarriages happen.
- I don't want to talk about this.

06:11.732 --> 06:14.389
There's nothing
you could've done differently.

06:18.837 --> 06:20.149
So you're still in New York?

06:20.944 --> 06:23.039
- For now. - And you're staying
with your mom out here?

06:23.284 --> 06:24.644
Uh, no.

06:25.298 --> 06:26.139
Listen, what are you doing tonight?

06:26.140 --> 06:27.596
- I would love for you...
- I... I can't do this,

06:27.597 --> 06:28.616
- Scotty. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Michelle...

06:28.617 --> 06:30.524
I'm just... I'm not...
I'm not doing well right now.

06:30.525 --> 06:32.508
- Mich... Michelle.
- I'm sorry, Scotty.

06:40.958 --> 06:42.142
Oh.

06:44.860 --> 06:45.928
Brody.

06:46.344 --> 06:47.694
What's going on with that beer?

06:47.695 --> 06:49.871
We finally convinced mom
to play another round.

06:51.759 --> 06:52.402
You okay?

06:52.403 --> 06:54.177
Yeah. I just, uh...

06:54.308 --> 06:56.035
playing a little too hard, that's all.

06:56.036 --> 06:57.744
Why... why don't you
sit down for a second?

06:57.745 --> 06:59.592
Justin, I'm fine.

06:59.593 --> 07:01.800
You're not fine.
You're sweating through your shirt.

07:02.375 --> 07:05.096
You E.M.T.s never
go off duty, do you?

07:05.248 --> 07:06.293
How long have you
been feeling like this?

07:06.294 --> 07:09.448
Ever since I ate
that viennese dobos torte.

07:10.368 --> 07:11.551
Yeah. Well, your pulse is racing.

07:11.552 --> 07:12.635
Are you feeling
chest pains right now?

07:12.636 --> 07:14.419
Justin, Justin,
I probably ate too much,

07:14.420 --> 07:16.127
and I was up there
throwing out clues

07:16.128 --> 07:17.948
like a pitcher
at a home run derby.

07:17.949 --> 07:19.372
Are you taking any medications?

07:19.373 --> 07:22.412
No, not unless you count
flaxseed oil for my joints.

07:22.526 --> 07:24.158
Okay, how many fingers
am I holding up?

07:24.641 --> 07:26.764
For goodness sake. 12.

07:26.765 --> 07:28.861
I'm actually not kidding.
How many fingers am I holding up?

07:28.890 --> 07:31.344
Two. I'm fine. Really.

07:31.345 --> 07:34.592
- I... I... I just had a physical.
I'm in perfect shape. - When?

07:35.400 --> 07:38.064
Last week at St. Francis.

07:38.085 --> 07:40.451
I've been playing baseball
all my life, kid.

07:40.452 --> 07:43.653
Heartburn aside,
I'm probably healthier than you are.

07:43.861 --> 07:46.196
Come on. Let's get back to the game.

08:03.903 --> 08:06.781
Oh... God.

08:06.927 --> 08:09.215
I can't believe I slept.

08:09.301 --> 08:11.076
What time is it?

08:19.597 --> 08:20.828
Ah!

08:22.535 --> 08:24.060
Where's my house?

08:24.061 --> 08:26.029
There's some orange juice
in the fridge.

08:26.204 --> 08:29.354
Uh, I don't want
any orange juice.

08:29.355 --> 08:31.505
Where the hell are we?
What's going on?

08:31.541 --> 08:33.081
- Taking a trip.
- What?

08:33.169 --> 08:35.741
Yeah. You came over
after the celebrity game.

08:35.743 --> 08:38.043
You laid your head down
for a minute during what I thought

08:38.044 --> 08:40.159
was a very compelling story
about Hank Aaron...

08:40.160 --> 08:40.966
It was so boring,
I can't begin to tell you.

08:40.967 --> 08:43.442
And you closed your eyes,
and then you asked

08:43.443 --> 08:44.802
- if you could sleep on the couch.
- I remember that.

08:44.803 --> 08:46.252
"One step closer"
is what you said.

08:46.253 --> 08:49.719
One step closer, yes, yes.
But where are we going?

08:49.720 --> 08:51.780
- To a ball game in Fresno.
- What?

08:51.781 --> 08:54.671
No, I can't go to Fresno.
It... it's Luc's opening tonight.

08:54.672 --> 08:55.898
The game's at 1:00.

08:55.899 --> 08:58.412
I'll have you back in Pasadena
before anyone knows you left.

08:58.413 --> 09:01.169
Oh, for goodness sakes.

09:01.840 --> 09:04.050
Ugh. Oh.

09:04.904 --> 09:07.801
God. Who am I?

09:08.532 --> 09:09.964
Cassettes are
in the glove compartment.

09:09.965 --> 09:12.412
- Pop one in.
- Cassettes?

09:12.477 --> 09:15.484
People download this stuff
these days.

09:16.628 --> 09:18.548
Ah. Ew.

09:18.809 --> 09:20.536
Okay, bread.

09:21.401 --> 09:22.679
The animals.

09:22.916 --> 09:24.355
Country Joe and the...

09:24.356 --> 09:26.772
This is a time capsule we're in.

09:27.132 --> 09:29.252
All right. You're stoked already.

09:29.253 --> 09:31.519
- Yeah, right.
- Yeah, there's a shower in the back.

09:31.520 --> 09:32.668
Ew. I'm not taking a shower in here.

09:32.669 --> 09:34.395
I packed you a change of clothes.

09:34.396 --> 09:36.648
I brought your toothbrush,
your purse, your phone.

09:36.649 --> 09:40.561
You're very, very thoughtful.
You have the Beach Boys.

09:40.562 --> 09:41.889
Your favorite, right?

09:42.980 --> 09:44.527
I can't believe you remember that.

09:44.528 --> 09:47.266
Okay. Come on. Let's go.
This is gonna be gold.

09:49.297 --> 09:51.185
Where's the seat belt?

09:52.833 --> 09:54.480
It usually works when I hit it.

09:58.880 --> 10:02.196
Well... we could always
sing instead.

10:02.216 --> 10:03.183
Uh-oh.

10:03.184 --> 10:06.460
Wouldn't it be nice
to live together

10:06.461 --> 10:07.720
how many miles
is it to Fresno?

10:07.721 --> 10:10.676
In the kind of world
where we belong?

10:10.677 --> 10:12.009
Ugh. Oh, man.

10:12.010 --> 10:14.576
So we've been here,
uh, over ten years.

10:14.577 --> 10:16.591
We upgraded all the utilities

10:16.592 --> 10:19.008
and repainted
just a couple of years ago.

10:19.873 --> 10:22.020
Listen, I know
the real estate market's

10:22.021 --> 10:23.792
barely up from the slump...

10:23.793 --> 10:25.975
But we're kind of hoping
that maybe

10:25.976 --> 10:29.072
- this neighborhood hasn't done
as badly as some and... - Sarah.

10:29.141 --> 10:32.120
Listen, I am totally with you,
and I'm glad

10:32.121 --> 10:33.971
that you're a realist
as to where the market is.

10:33.972 --> 10:35.402
- Yeah, I mean, I get it.
- But the truth is,

10:35.403 --> 10:38.622
- I can have this house sold
by the end of the week... - What?

10:38.623 --> 10:41.103
- And at a price I think you will be
happy with. - You're kidding?

10:41.104 --> 10:44.015
Just look at this place.
You have a restored craftsman

10:44.016 --> 10:45.503
in an extremely
desirable neighborhood

10:45.504 --> 10:47.300
with virtually no turnover.

10:47.421 --> 10:50.199
- Ooh, the kitchen... is that just
through here? - Yeah, but I haven't

10:50.200 --> 10:51.755
cleaned up last night's Sushi, so sorry

10:51.756 --> 10:54.284
- about the...
- It could smell like a wharf for all I care.

10:54.300 --> 10:55.809
I have a very motivated couple

10:55.810 --> 10:57.876
who have been dying
to get into this school district.

10:57.877 --> 10:58.910
Oh, the schools are amazing.

10:58.911 --> 10:59.900
- Well, the...
- Yeah, and, oh, now there's,

10:59.901 --> 11:02.683
- there's an office in the attic?
- That's right.

11:02.684 --> 11:06.107
Actually, my fiancé is using it
as his art studio at the moment.

11:06.108 --> 11:09.547
- Oh, well, that makes
a perfect playroom. - Yeah.

11:09.672 --> 11:11.492
You know, if we signed
a contract today,

11:11.540 --> 11:14.496
I could have the Leones here
tomorrow for a pre-list showing.

11:16.153 --> 11:17.395
W... wow.

11:17.396 --> 11:18.336
Tomorrow, Sunday?

11:18.337 --> 11:19.393
Yeah.

11:19.761 --> 11:23.440
Sarah, oh, but th...
this is what you want, right?

11:23.510 --> 11:24.811
Oh, please don't go
having second thoughts.

11:24.812 --> 11:26.575
No. No, no, no,
no second thoughts.

11:26.576 --> 11:29.022
My God.
This... this is perfect.

11:29.023 --> 11:30.335
You know, it's my fiancé's

11:30.336 --> 11:32.028
- first solo art show tonight...
- Oh, wow.

11:32.029 --> 11:34.400
And we're gonna
be getting married soon,

11:34.401 --> 11:37.552
so this would be, you know,
a whole new beginning.

11:37.751 --> 11:39.928
What's the line
from that movie? Um...

11:41.459 --> 11:44.196
I'm going to sell this house today.

11:44.197 --> 11:47.204
Oh. What movie is that?

11:47.597 --> 11:49.992
Rescue 1-4,
vic's a 36-year-old female...

11:50.000 --> 11:51.376
You're dead to me, Walker.

11:52.049 --> 11:53.439
I guess that means
you saw the schedule.

11:53.440 --> 11:56.755
Yeah. We always
work together on Sundays,

11:56.764 --> 11:58.575
- you know, like blood brothers.
- I know, I know, I know. I forgot.

11:58.576 --> 12:00.912
I'm going fishing
with Brody on Sunday.

12:01.572 --> 12:03.236
This guy's really moving in, huh?

12:03.605 --> 12:04.859
You think he's the real deal?

12:04.860 --> 12:07.188
I don't know, you know?
I mean, he could be.

12:08.390 --> 12:09.346
What, you don't like him?

12:09.347 --> 12:11.210
No, I do like him, a lot, actually.

12:11.211 --> 12:14.923
I just... look,
I don't want to overreact,

12:14.924 --> 12:17.341
but I was with him last night,
and the guy looked terrible.

12:17.784 --> 12:18.856
How terrible?

12:19.268 --> 12:21.163
Exhibiting-signs-of-
a-heart-attack terrible.

12:21.164 --> 12:22.535
And he blamed it on the food

12:22.536 --> 12:25.591
or he... he said he was exhausted
from... from playing celebrity.

12:25.976 --> 12:27.608
Remind me not to go
to your game night.

12:28.853 --> 12:30.327
You know what I don't get?
He said he got a physical

12:30.328 --> 12:33.019
last week at St. Francis,
and everything was fine.

12:33.020 --> 12:34.136
Okay.

12:34.137 --> 12:37.863
- So what's the problem?
- Why would a guy from Modesto

12:37.864 --> 12:40.428
suddenly come to a hospital
in Pasadena for a physical

12:40.429 --> 12:41.980
unless he thought
something was wrong?

12:43.369 --> 12:43.884
Right?

12:43.885 --> 12:44.957
Yeah.

12:47.812 --> 12:49.012
Well, let's find out.

12:50.120 --> 12:51.456
I mean, a 6 year old
could hack into

12:51.457 --> 12:52.489
- the computer system at St. Francis.
- Whoa whoa, Dan.

12:52.633 --> 12:53.887
What are you talking about?

12:53.888 --> 12:55.352
Don't forget about
H.I.P.A.A. laws.

12:55.444 --> 12:58.308
You're the one who's worried, dude.
I'm trying to help.

12:58.592 --> 12:59.794
Well, don't.

13:01.389 --> 13:02.685
Dan.

13:04.409 --> 13:06.153
I'm just taking a leak, man.

13:10.758 --> 13:11.604
What do you mean,
she seemed off?

13:11.605 --> 13:13.315
She just wasn't the same
Michelle I know.

13:13.316 --> 13:14.963
Well, I'm not surprised.
What did you expect?

13:14.964 --> 13:16.805
She moved across the country.

13:16.984 --> 13:18.980
She made it perfectly clear,
she didn't want to see us.

13:18.981 --> 13:20.392
I know, but she's my friend.

13:20.393 --> 13:23.847
Maybe... maybe I should've
tried harder to repair things.

13:23.848 --> 13:26.166
How? She changed
her cell phone number.

13:26.167 --> 13:27.995
She didn't even give you
an address, okay?

13:27.996 --> 13:31.278
- She cut us out, Scotty.
- She couldn't even look me in the eye.

13:32.936 --> 13:34.361
You know, this one time
in High School,

13:34.664 --> 13:37.272
she disappeared after
a really bad breakup.

13:37.687 --> 13:38.884
But she called me

13:38.885 --> 13:40.880
so that everyone would know
that s she was all right.

13:40.881 --> 13:42.881
- Well, I thought you said she was
only gone for a week. - Yeah.

13:42.920 --> 13:45.065
She came back to drama class
like nothing happened.

13:46.496 --> 13:48.945
- Then they made her go see a shrink.
- What are you trying to say?

13:51.096 --> 13:53.008
Maybe the miscarriage
set something off in her.

13:53.009 --> 13:55.196
No. No, no, no.
I think you're making too much outta this.

13:55.197 --> 13:58.212
Maybe. But it's hard
to see her in pain like this.

13:58.213 --> 14:01.635
I want to help her.
She wasn't just our surrogate, Kevin.

14:01.636 --> 14:03.477
I don't think she wants
your help, Scotty.

14:04.068 --> 14:05.646
Michelle doesn't want
to go back there now.

14:05.647 --> 14:06.960
I know I don't.

14:08.579 --> 14:10.751
Olivia. Hey, sweetheart.
What's going on?

14:10.752 --> 14:14.644
- Are you excited about the zoo?
When's Mrs. Turner coming to get you? - Now.

14:14.645 --> 14:17.252
Olivia, about what you just heard...

14:17.577 --> 14:18.335
Um...

14:18.336 --> 14:20.640
That's them.
I'm gonna go get my jacket.

14:27.088 --> 14:28.752
How long was she standing there?

14:29.312 --> 14:31.552
Long enough to wonder
if she was second choice.

14:33.065 --> 14:34.233
Damn it.

15:01.557 --> 15:02.496
Sarah?

15:02.497 --> 15:04.800
Oh, my God.
You scared me.

15:04.801 --> 15:06.320
Why aren't you
at the gallery?

15:06.325 --> 15:09.044
Uh, I.. I gotta come here
and get some clothes.

15:09.341 --> 15:10.983
Wh... what have you done
with my studio?

15:10.984 --> 15:13.320
I spruced it up.
Guess what.

15:13.321 --> 15:16.180
Our realtor has
a very motivated buyer

15:16.181 --> 15:17.416
who's interested in this house.

15:17.417 --> 15:18.506
Where are my brushes?

15:18.507 --> 15:19.623
Oh, I washed them all
and put them in there...

15:19.624 --> 15:21.465
- You washed my brushes?!
- Yeah.

15:21.466 --> 15:22.351
You can't wash my brushes.

15:22.352 --> 15:24.567
- They have to be done
a certain way, Sarah. - Oh.

15:24.568 --> 15:26.596
A... and what happened
to my little rug

15:26.597 --> 15:27.896
that was under my chair?

15:27.897 --> 15:30.499
Oh, that was filthy.
It was covered in paint splotches...

15:30.500 --> 15:32.979
Paint splotches?
I'm painter. I use paint.

15:33.032 --> 15:35.676
- Paint makes splotches, Sarah.
- Why are you so upset?

15:35.677 --> 15:38.385
My Picasso book... it was
all completely marked. Where is it?

15:38.386 --> 15:40.824
Oh, I... I put all the books
back on the shelf.

15:40.825 --> 15:42.620
They were everywhere.
You know I found

15:42.621 --> 15:44.859
a half-eaten hot pocket
behind this cushion?

15:44.860 --> 15:46.592
I don't know where
anything is anymore.

15:46.593 --> 15:48.319
Look, honey,
I know there's a fine line

15:48.320 --> 15:49.876
between an atelier
and a dorm room,

15:49.877 --> 15:52.804
- but I think you kinda crossed it.
- It's not funny, Sarah.

15:53.020 --> 15:55.307
This is how I do things.
It's how I work.

15:55.620 --> 15:57.562
I'm sorry. I was just...
I'm trying to make it presentable.

15:57.563 --> 15:59.864
- The buyers are coming tomorrow.
- The buyers?

15:59.865 --> 16:01.667
You told me you were
just getting an appraisal.

16:01.668 --> 16:02.804
Where is my cup?

16:05.162 --> 16:07.231
- The one with the crack?
- That's my lucky cup.

16:07.232 --> 16:09.316
I got it the day
I took Cooper to Disneyland.

16:09.317 --> 16:11.075
The next day,
I sold five paintings.

16:11.076 --> 16:13.062
You can't just come in here
and clean everything up

16:13.063 --> 16:15.492
- when you want.
- That's why you're freaking out.

16:15.493 --> 16:17.471
You're superstitious
about tonight. Listen,

16:17.472 --> 16:20.147
everything is gonna be great.
Your paintings are beautiful.

16:20.148 --> 16:21.844
I'm not superstitious, Sarah.

16:22.560 --> 16:23.929
I'm just going back to the gallery.

16:23.930 --> 16:25.990
You should never have done
this without asking me.

16:26.064 --> 16:27.793
You should never have done this.

16:38.105 --> 16:40.712
I can't believe
you caught a foul ball.

16:41.444 --> 16:43.892
I can't believe
I ate three hot dogs.

16:44.616 --> 16:47.131
Oh, you know, it's getting late.

16:47.132 --> 16:48.327
I really think we should go.

16:48.328 --> 16:49.731
Well, we have to be a little late.

16:49.732 --> 16:53.436
- It's an art opening. It's the
fashionable thing to do. - Oh, I see.

16:53.437 --> 16:55.931
Ah, what a great day.

16:55.944 --> 16:58.483
I just want to relish
this moment a little longer.

16:58.484 --> 17:01.443
Don't say relish.
I ate three hot dogs.

17:01.497 --> 17:02.526
Oh.

17:03.081 --> 17:06.249
God, you love baseball.
You get so excited.

17:06.867 --> 17:08.613
I'm sorry you lost your team.

17:08.647 --> 17:10.502
Lost 'em? They fired me, Nora.

17:10.503 --> 17:12.674
Yeah, for benching a guy
who was using steroids?

17:12.675 --> 17:14.292
Honestly, I think
you should sue them.

17:14.294 --> 17:16.884
It's okay. There are other teams.
Take this one.

17:16.885 --> 17:19.238
Oh, yeah. The Fresno Gophers.

17:20.265 --> 17:22.828
Could they have picked
a less intimidating animal?

17:22.829 --> 17:24.525
I mean, what,
were hamsters taken?

17:24.742 --> 17:26.435
They could use a new manager.

17:26.435 --> 17:27.988
I'll say. They stink.

17:28.284 --> 17:29.168
10-to-nothing?

17:29.169 --> 17:31.616
And how many errors
did that shortstop make?

17:31.617 --> 17:34.408
He's playing the wrong position.
He should be playing left field.

17:34.409 --> 17:35.812
Oh, pfft.
No, he should be benched.

17:35.813 --> 17:37.714
My God.
Leave the left fielder out there.

17:37.715 --> 17:39.096
He went 3-for-4,
for godness sake.

17:39.097 --> 17:40.920
Oh, well, I'll keep that in mind.

17:44.077 --> 17:45.164
What does that mean?

17:45.356 --> 17:48.412
Oh... did you...
did you come out here

17:48.413 --> 17:50.171
- because you thought
maybe there was a... - Nora.

17:50.172 --> 17:53.628
- ...a job to be had? Is that it?
- Oh, there is a job in it.

17:53.825 --> 17:55.971
- What?
- Yeah, I got a call last week.

17:56.220 --> 17:59.693
And, uh, you know, they
heard about me leaving Modesto.

17:59.694 --> 18:01.984
They... they said they needed
a new manager, and, uh...

18:01.985 --> 18:03.409
Oh, my God.

18:03.633 --> 18:06.371
Oh, my God. This is like
dèja vu all over again.

18:06.372 --> 18:09.327
Isn't that what your hero,
Yogi Berra, said?

18:09.328 --> 18:10.432
You did this before.

18:10.433 --> 18:13.375
You ran off to play baseball in 1967.

18:13.376 --> 18:16.570
Did you drag me up here just
to say good-bye to me again?

18:16.571 --> 18:19.642
Good-bye?
I want you to come with me.

18:23.125 --> 18:24.516
- Really?
- Yeah.

18:24.753 --> 18:26.491
I'm selling the house in Modesto.

18:26.492 --> 18:28.076
We could get a little place up here,

18:28.092 --> 18:31.949
take the winnie on road games,
see the west together.

18:33.005 --> 18:33.999
Are you serious?

18:34.000 --> 18:35.577
Of course I'm serious.

18:35.578 --> 18:37.692
They made me take
a physical and everything.

18:37.693 --> 18:40.397
It would only be
for the spring and summer.

18:40.656 --> 18:41.829
I told the owner to wait

18:41.830 --> 18:43.647
- in the restaurant across the street.
- Oh, you did?

18:43.648 --> 18:45.675
- Yeah, me and my girlfriend
would come over and join him later.

18:45.676 --> 18:47.854
Girlfriend? That's what you're
calling me, your girlfriend?

18:47.855 --> 18:51.169
Okay, I'm sorry.
Hey. I thought that's what you were.

18:55.024 --> 18:57.440
You know why I never
made it as a player?

18:58.261 --> 18:59.668
Strikeouts.

18:59.761 --> 19:02.969
And I didn't go down swinging.
I was always caught looking.

19:02.970 --> 19:04.463
Pitches came my way,

19:04.464 --> 19:06.640
and I never saw one
good enough for me.

19:07.352 --> 19:09.897
You're better than anything
that came my way, Nora.

19:10.040 --> 19:11.880
I'm not letting this one go by.

19:14.397 --> 19:14.872
I don't know what to say.

19:14.873 --> 19:16.696
I'm not doing it without you.

19:16.890 --> 19:17.949
You know, if... if you don't want to...

19:17.950 --> 19:20.887
Just... just...
please just let me think about it.

19:20.888 --> 19:22.296
You would think about it?

19:24.166 --> 19:25.328
Really?

19:28.884 --> 19:31.463
You know, there's a difference
between being fashionably late

19:31.464 --> 19:33.209
and not showing up at all.

19:33.693 --> 19:35.245
You know what else Yogi said?

19:36.232 --> 19:40.056
When you come
to a fork in the road, take it.

19:50.404 --> 19:52.228
So what animals did you see?

19:52.304 --> 19:55.537
A zebra, lions...
stuff that you see at the zoo.

19:58.589 --> 20:00.314
Uh, listen, Olivia,

20:00.315 --> 20:02.781
about what you heard
earlier today...

20:02.782 --> 20:05.047
You tried to have a baby
with Michelle, didn't you?

20:06.448 --> 20:08.726
She was trying to help us, yes.

20:08.727 --> 20:09.664
How?

20:10.233 --> 20:12.433
Well, it's not like either of us...

20:13.618 --> 20:15.032
Oh, boy. Um...

20:15.114 --> 20:16.395
What's a surrogate?

20:16.396 --> 20:20.108
Uh, it's actually the woman
who carries the baby to term,

20:20.109 --> 20:22.703
but ours wasn't born.

20:23.235 --> 20:25.335
Is that why Michelle
doesn't want to see you,

20:25.861 --> 20:27.662
because you're still sad?

20:28.394 --> 20:29.285
Well...

20:29.458 --> 20:32.754
I mean, we were, yes,
but then we found you.

20:33.200 --> 20:34.458
Do you understand?

20:34.459 --> 20:35.463
Yeah. Yeah.

20:35.464 --> 20:39.474
- Good, because we want you
to be okay. - I am.

20:41.686 --> 20:44.222
Can I please wear
my new leggings to Luc's show?

20:44.223 --> 20:45.958
- Of course.
- Sounds very chic.

20:45.959 --> 20:47.628
Cool. I'll go get dressed.

20:47.629 --> 20:48.575
Great.

20:50.847 --> 20:51.805
Think she's okay?

20:51.806 --> 20:52.912
I don't know.

20:54.233 --> 20:56.585
We're only supposed to say
as much as they ask, right?

20:56.586 --> 20:57.831
It'll be good for her
to go to the show,

20:57.832 --> 21:02.192
- spend some time with us.
- Um, I'm gonna have to meet you there.

21:02.500 --> 21:03.312
Why?

21:03.313 --> 21:07.698
Well, I've been calling friends
trying to find Michelle all day,

21:07.699 --> 21:10.333
and nobody has heard from her
since she left for New York.

21:10.653 --> 21:11.881
Okay, that is weird.

21:11.882 --> 21:14.321
And then a friend said
she saw her at the W Hotel.

21:14.322 --> 21:16.691
I called over to the hotel,
she didn't pick up the phone, so...

21:16.692 --> 21:19.610
Scotty, I think we have enough
on our hands without this.

21:19.794 --> 21:21.079
What if something's
really wrong with her?

21:21.080 --> 21:23.345
- She was my best friend.
- Well, what am I supposed to tell Olivia

21:23.346 --> 21:25.290
when she asks
where you're going?

21:25.986 --> 21:27.606
Tell her the truth.

21:37.619 --> 21:38.919
Boo-yah.

21:39.821 --> 21:41.521
Nick Brody's medical record.

21:43.290 --> 21:44.793
Dude, are you kidding me?

21:44.986 --> 21:46.561
You wanted answers.
You got 'em.

21:46.818 --> 21:49.782
Dan, do you have any idea
how many laws you just broke?

21:49.783 --> 21:52.177
Please. We'll shred
the copy after you look.

21:54.232 --> 21:57.078
No. I... I appreciate
the effort, but I'm...

21:58.062 --> 21:59.473
I'm not gonna cross that line.

21:59.474 --> 22:03.066
Well, you don't have to,
because I already did.

22:03.107 --> 22:03.946
What?

22:04.256 --> 22:05.834
I was curious so I peeked.

22:05.835 --> 22:07.738
You know what?
Your boy checks out.

22:07.739 --> 22:11.110
B.P. 130 over 80, 23 B.M.I.,

22:11.111 --> 22:12.677
and basic blood work
to check cholesterol

22:12.678 --> 22:14.286
comes back better than mine.

22:14.603 --> 22:16.034
See for yourself.

22:19.600 --> 22:20.994
Attaboy.

22:23.601 --> 22:25.814
See? Won't you sleep better now?

22:30.782 --> 22:32.260
That can't be right.

22:32.261 --> 22:34.471
What? What's wrong?
He told you the truth.

22:36.823 --> 22:38.324
No, he didn't.

22:39.684 --> 22:41.221
He lied.

22:51.005 --> 22:52.885
I think he's really mad at me.

22:52.886 --> 22:54.720
Well, if you cleaned
my office, I'd kill you.

22:54.721 --> 22:58.227
Why? You can clean my office
anytime, right, Olivia?

22:58.709 --> 23:01.027
I thought I was doing him a favor.

23:01.161 --> 23:03.634
Now I can't even get five minutes
to talk to him about it.

23:03.635 --> 23:06.599
- Well, look at him. He's famous now.
- Like a Jonas brother.

23:06.600 --> 23:08.316
- Yeah.
- Which one?

23:08.317 --> 23:09.880
- Joe.
- Ah.

23:10.126 --> 23:12.356
When's Scotty getting here?
He's gonna miss the show.

23:12.357 --> 23:14.587
- He'll be here. Don't worry.
- Where is Scotty?

23:14.588 --> 23:16.643
He doesn't want to talk about it
in front of me.

23:16.644 --> 23:21.462
That's not true. I told you.
He's gone to see Michelle.

23:22.429 --> 23:26.318
- Their surrogate.
- He ran into her. It's no big deal.

23:26.319 --> 23:28.544
- Then why is he going to see her?
- Um...

23:29.135 --> 23:32.142
- I don't know.
- Hey. I love your leggings.

23:32.143 --> 23:34.858
- Everything okay?
- Uh, she checked out.

23:35.034 --> 23:36.115
We should probably...

23:36.491 --> 23:37.451
- Right.
- Yeah.

23:37.452 --> 23:39.642
- Hey, do you want to look at some art?
- See what I mean?

23:39.643 --> 23:42.138
- They don't want to talk about it
in front of me. - Got it.

23:42.139 --> 23:43.873
Come on. Come on.

23:54.996 --> 23:57.158
Ah, I told you
we wouldn't miss anything.

23:57.346 --> 23:58.471
Oh, hey.

23:59.839 --> 24:00.729
If we get separated,

24:00.730 --> 24:02.756
I'll meet you by the painting
that looks like a mushroom.

24:02.757 --> 24:04.109
- What painting that looks like...?
- Right there.

24:04.144 --> 24:06.218
- Nora.
- Hey, nice stuff.

24:06.219 --> 24:07.837
- Hi. This is fabulous.
- Brody.

24:08.173 --> 24:10.350
- I'm French. Are you kidding?
- Oh.

24:12.496 --> 24:15.583
- You guys look great. - Well, you
should've seen us three hours ago.

24:15.584 --> 24:16.873
Mom, Brody.

24:16.874 --> 24:18.398
So I was correct.

24:18.399 --> 24:21.114
I have been living
with the next Renoir.

24:21.115 --> 24:21.903
Oh.

24:22.788 --> 24:24.032
Oh, can we get another photo?

24:24.033 --> 24:26.587
Sure. Um, sorry.

24:28.877 --> 24:30.321
Well, don't they want you
in the picture?

24:30.322 --> 24:31.202
Oh, God, no.

24:31.203 --> 24:32.866
It's all about him.
They don't care about me.

24:32.867 --> 24:34.625
You girls look like
you could use some wine.

24:34.626 --> 24:36.313
- White.
- Make it a double.

24:36.314 --> 24:40.286
- Okay. Ask your mother about
the foul ball. - What foul ball?

24:40.287 --> 24:41.445
Well, that would be the foul ball

24:41.446 --> 24:44.287
- that I caught with one hand...
my left hand... - Ooh.

24:44.288 --> 24:46.831
But I happen to be
right-handed, so whoo-hoo.

24:46.832 --> 24:50.178
Whoo-hoo.
Someone's had a good day.

24:50.179 --> 24:53.314
Yeah, well, you know, it was...
it was a day.

24:53.315 --> 24:55.173
It was a... it was a day.

24:56.249 --> 24:57.622
Are you okay?

24:57.623 --> 24:59.191
Oh, I don't know.

24:59.514 --> 25:01.768
It's like she's running away
from her whole life.

25:01.769 --> 25:04.067
- Yeah. - Are you guys
still talking about Michelle?

25:04.630 --> 25:06.126
Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie.

25:07.040 --> 25:09.327
You know what? You want to get
one of those bottled root beers?

25:09.328 --> 25:12.381
No, I want you to tell me
why you went to go see Michelle.

25:12.609 --> 25:14.439
- I just wanted to talk to her.
- Yeah.

25:14.440 --> 25:16.876
Are you guys gonna have
another baby with her?

25:16.877 --> 25:18.791
- No, no.
- Is that what you think?

25:18.792 --> 25:20.530
I don't know. Liv...

25:21.652 --> 25:22.561
Okay, you're right.

25:22.562 --> 25:24.981
I have to let this thing
with Michelle go. I'm sorry.

25:26.757 --> 25:29.186
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
The Fresno Gophers?

25:29.187 --> 25:31.121
Yes, they're terrible,
especially the shortstop.

25:31.122 --> 25:33.463
- But the ball field is beautiful...
-Slow down.

25:33.464 --> 25:35.325
- And they want Brody
to manage the team. - Oh.

25:35.326 --> 25:37.697
And he asked me
to go with him to Fresno.

25:37.698 --> 25:38.782
Wait, wait, wait, to Fresno?

25:38.783 --> 25:40.226
I don't know what to think.
I mean, we were sitting

25:40.227 --> 25:42.894
- in the stands, and it felt
like a proposal. - Oh, my God.

25:42.895 --> 25:44.916
It's a very big deal.
Of course, I would keep the house.

25:44.917 --> 25:46.936
We'd only be there
for spring and summer,

25:46.937 --> 25:48.422
but... this is silly.
I...I... I... I'm not

25:48.423 --> 25:51.566
- even considering it.
- Then why are you hyperventilating?

25:51.567 --> 25:53.852
Well, because obviously,
I'm considering it.

25:53.853 --> 25:55.127
- Here you go, ladies.
- Hi.

25:55.128 --> 25:55.886
Hey.

25:57.888 --> 26:00.750
I'm gonna go over and,
uh, catch up with Luc,

26:00.751 --> 26:02.507
so, um, don't leave...

26:02.508 --> 26:04.465
till you close the deal.

26:06.583 --> 26:08.822
I guess that means
you haven't decided yet.

26:09.049 --> 26:11.868
No, I... I haven't.
You know, let's look at the art.

26:11.869 --> 26:15.392
Oh! Look at that painting.
It's fabulous.

26:32.698 --> 26:34.139
Hey. How's it going?

26:34.140 --> 26:35.097
Great.

26:36.046 --> 26:37.541
I'm so proud of you.

26:37.750 --> 26:38.790
Thank you.

26:38.791 --> 26:41.447
Olivia thinks
you're gonna be famous.

26:42.046 --> 26:43.467
That's nice.

26:43.904 --> 26:45.970
Look, I'm... I'm sorry if I...

26:45.971 --> 26:47.739
We'll talk about it later.

26:47.740 --> 26:50.508
It's just... it's your big night.
I really didn't mean to ruin it.

26:50.509 --> 26:53.399
You didn't ruin it.
You just didn't think.

26:53.609 --> 26:56.042
Right now, I have
to concentrate on my work, okay?

26:56.043 --> 26:58.684
Listen, I'm gonna go home,
I'm gonna put everything back

26:58.685 --> 26:59.379
exactly where...

26:59.380 --> 27:01.189
You still don't understand
why I got upset?

27:01.190 --> 27:04.250
No. I... I don't think I do, Luc.
I'm...

27:04.251 --> 27:06.446
Luc, I need you a moment.

27:07.390 --> 27:08.527
Go.

27:11.875 --> 27:13.646
Luc, this is Mr. and Mrs. Slaughter.

27:13.647 --> 27:15.334
They are major collectors.

27:15.335 --> 27:16.951
I thought that you should meet.

27:17.878 --> 27:20.215
Nice to meet you.
Thank you so much for coming.

27:35.851 --> 27:36.995
Come on in.

27:39.034 --> 27:40.392
Is everything okay?

27:40.853 --> 27:42.566
We missed you at the show.

27:45.727 --> 27:49.131
It was a panic attack
you had last night, wasn't it?

27:49.132 --> 27:51.333
What? No.
Why would I have a p...

27:51.334 --> 27:53.393
Brody, you lied
about your blood type.

27:53.978 --> 27:56.083
You said it wasn't possible
to be Sarah's father

27:56.084 --> 27:57.969
because you were type O.

27:58.341 --> 27:59.653
You're not.

28:00.106 --> 28:01.683
You're type B.

28:02.110 --> 28:03.709
I saw your medical records.

28:03.710 --> 28:05.043
What the hell are you doing,
looking at my...

28:05.044 --> 28:07.542
I think that's the lesser crime
right now, don't you?

28:10.571 --> 28:12.514
Are you Sarah's father?

28:19.521 --> 28:21.114
It's possible.

28:21.296 --> 28:23.620
It's... you don't know?

28:23.621 --> 28:26.410
- William was also type B.
- How do you know that?

28:26.411 --> 28:28.965
I asked him, and he told me.

28:30.143 --> 28:32.732
He also told me
to lie to your mother.

28:32.764 --> 28:34.066
And you did?

28:34.067 --> 28:36.468
They were married by then, Justin.

28:37.238 --> 28:39.788
So I told your mother
I was type O

28:40.399 --> 28:42.326
and walked away.

28:45.047 --> 28:47.574
Did my father ever have
a D.N.A. test?

28:47.669 --> 28:49.285
If he did, he never told me.

28:52.153 --> 28:53.423
I can't believe this.

28:54.612 --> 28:56.514
Oh, man.

28:56.515 --> 28:58.358
Why did you come back here, Brody?

28:58.359 --> 29:00.358
Sarah's the one who came up
to find me, Justin.

29:00.359 --> 29:02.135
Okay, you didn't have
to follow her home.

29:02.136 --> 29:03.973
I couldn't get your mother
out of my mind.

29:03.974 --> 29:06.552
You managed to
for the last 40 years!

29:06.553 --> 29:08.378
No, I didn't, Justin.

29:08.740 --> 29:10.504
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

29:12.472 --> 29:14.198
Then you gotta tell her the truth.

29:14.377 --> 29:15.747
Don't you understand?

29:15.934 --> 29:18.933
Your mother and I have
a real chance here.

29:19.505 --> 29:21.328
I don't want to mess this up,

29:21.329 --> 29:23.098
not this time.

29:24.396 --> 29:25.270
No, you know what?

29:25.271 --> 29:27.572
My mother already
had one relationship

29:27.573 --> 29:29.367
that was based on lies.

29:29.892 --> 29:31.821
Do not do this to her again.

29:54.555 --> 29:55.704
I can't sleep.

29:55.705 --> 29:57.556
- What's wrong, sweetie?
- Come here.

29:58.453 --> 30:00.712
Can I ask you guys
one more question?

30:00.713 --> 30:01.604
Of course.

30:01.605 --> 30:04.051
You can ask us
any question you want.

30:04.559 --> 30:06.470
When you decided to adopt,

30:06.748 --> 30:09.842
were you trying
to adopt a baby?

30:09.843 --> 30:12.776
No. We wanted a family.

30:12.777 --> 30:14.820
And when we met you
at the fair that day,

30:14.821 --> 30:16.470
we realized, we'd found one.

30:16.727 --> 30:18.965
- So you don't wish that
I was younger when you met me? - No.

30:18.966 --> 30:20.955
Olivia, you're perfect.

30:20.956 --> 30:23.345
- The three of us... this is our family.
- Yeah.

30:23.499 --> 30:25.770
Is that why Michelle's mad at you,

30:25.771 --> 30:29.110
because you don't want to try
and have another baby with her?

30:29.900 --> 30:32.031
Michelle's going through
a hard time right now.

30:32.032 --> 30:33.529
- That... that's all.
- Yeah.

30:33.733 --> 30:36.620
- And she doesn't want to talk?
- Not right now.

30:36.801 --> 30:39.907
She's your friend.
You shouldn't give up on her.

30:40.062 --> 30:41.543
I can be a pain sometimes,

30:41.544 --> 30:44.051
and you guys never give up on me.

30:46.314 --> 30:47.595
I'll tell you what...

30:48.112 --> 30:50.836
we will promise
not to give up on Michelle

30:51.061 --> 30:53.798
if you promise
not to worry anymore.

30:53.799 --> 30:55.244
- Deal.
- Deal?

30:55.245 --> 30:56.424
- Deal?
- Deal.

30:56.425 --> 30:58.651
- Deal? Deal?
- Deal. Deal.

30:58.652 --> 31:01.718
Oh, Hans' wife was nice.

31:02.380 --> 31:04.569
She was a little bit touchy-feely.

31:04.897 --> 31:06.639
You think she was flirting with me?

31:06.640 --> 31:07.918
I don't know.

31:08.094 --> 31:09.197
I'm gonna take out the recycling,

31:09.198 --> 31:12.177
- otherwise it will pile up.
- Oh, Luc, please stop this.

31:12.178 --> 31:14.231
I endured the gallery,
the after party,

31:14.232 --> 31:16.704
the almost silent car ride home.

31:16.705 --> 31:18.472
Nobody's here.
You can yell at me if you want to.

31:18.473 --> 31:19.984
But I can't bear being in

31:19.985 --> 31:22.535
- the dog house any longer.
- I don't wanna yell.

31:23.316 --> 31:24.904
Look, I am sorry.

31:24.905 --> 31:27.662
I'm sorry a million times
that I cleaned your studio

31:27.663 --> 31:30.254
and washed your brushes and
threw out your favorite cup.

31:30.255 --> 31:32.246
Sarah, it's not about the studio.

31:33.094 --> 31:36.263
Okay, I crossed a line,
clearly, I didn't understand.

31:36.264 --> 31:38.570
No, clearly, you didn't understand.

31:38.830 --> 31:40.155
It's not about where we live,

31:40.156 --> 31:42.266
it's how we'll live with each other.

31:42.475 --> 31:45.717
And you shouldn't have listed
the house without telling me.

31:48.372 --> 31:50.332
You're right. I'm sorry.

31:50.923 --> 31:53.150
But this could be
a good thing, Luc.

31:53.151 --> 31:55.196
I mean, tonight,
all those people...

31:55.197 --> 31:58.771
Your art is...
going to a whole new level.

31:58.925 --> 32:02.390
You're gonna need space to work,
space to just breathe.

32:02.391 --> 32:04.369
But I don't want any more space.

32:05.500 --> 32:08.161
My mom used to live
all around the world...

32:08.788 --> 32:11.052
A loft in Paris,
a flat in Geneva,

32:11.053 --> 32:13.149
a hut in the Argentine jungle.

32:13.502 --> 32:15.083
When I was staying with her,

32:15.114 --> 32:18.124
I always felt I was just,
like, visiting.

32:18.125 --> 32:19.806
This house here

32:19.967 --> 32:22.397
is the first place
I truly feel safe.

32:22.660 --> 32:24.731
My work thrived here.

32:24.978 --> 32:28.143
Sarah, it's not about a room
or a chipped coffee cup.

32:29.471 --> 32:31.485
Our family began here.

32:35.867 --> 32:36.785
Well...

32:37.049 --> 32:41.990
speaking of that old...
chipped coffee cup...

32:44.218 --> 32:45.359
You had that all night?

32:45.360 --> 32:46.273
Mm-hmm.

32:47.501 --> 32:49.086
I rescued it.

32:50.172 --> 32:51.123
And let me tell you,

32:51.124 --> 32:54.338
it is very hard
to fit in to Balenciaga.

32:54.339 --> 32:55.244
Thank you.

32:57.675 --> 32:58.585
It's settled then.

32:58.586 --> 33:00.013
I shall call the realtor

33:00.340 --> 33:02.671
and have her call off her dogs.

33:02.854 --> 33:03.716
Yeah.

33:05.137 --> 33:06.428
We're home.

33:29.562 --> 33:30.753
Brody?

33:32.540 --> 33:34.743
Nora... what are you doing up?

33:34.744 --> 33:37.127
What are you doing up?
It's 2:00 in the morning.

33:37.128 --> 33:38.776
I saw your light on.

33:40.669 --> 33:42.343
I can't sleep.

33:42.875 --> 33:44.462
No, neither could I.

33:45.242 --> 33:46.593
I was thinking.

33:47.327 --> 33:48.842
You asked me to think,

33:48.843 --> 33:51.483
and so I've been doing
just that, and...

33:52.220 --> 33:53.259
Yes.

33:53.512 --> 33:56.626
Brody, yes.
My answer's yes.

33:56.975 --> 33:58.733
Let's get a little place in Fresno.

33:58.734 --> 34:00.229
You can sell
your house in Modesto.

34:00.230 --> 34:01.825
We'll keep this house,
of course,

34:01.826 --> 34:04.284
- then I can come back and forth.
- Nora...

34:04.285 --> 34:07.711
I know, I know.
Our history is complicated.

34:08.757 --> 34:10.370
You got that right.

34:12.402 --> 34:14.697
You got a whole life here.

34:14.821 --> 34:16.335
- I know. - Are... are you sure you...
what you want...

34:16.335 --> 34:18.293
I know that.
I have a whole life here.

34:18.293 --> 34:21.495
But I'm not replacing any of that.
I'm adding to it.

34:22.120 --> 34:24.458
And I want to come with you, Brody.

34:25.556 --> 34:27.081
I love you.

34:27.641 --> 34:29.886
I was just going
to knock on your door

34:29.887 --> 34:32.804
and see if perhaps you'd like
to come upstairs tonight.

34:34.833 --> 34:36.228
It's always nice to sleep in a bed

34:36.228 --> 34:38.246
that doesn't turn into a table.

35:00.292 --> 35:02.608
I love you, too, Nora Holden.

35:19.486 --> 35:20.354
Kevin.

35:20.355 --> 35:21.575
What?

35:21.576 --> 35:22.704
She's right.

35:23.955 --> 35:25.067
Who?

35:25.232 --> 35:26.477
Olivia.

35:27.287 --> 35:28.485
We can't give up.

35:30.248 --> 35:32.581
We have to find Michelle
and try to help her.

35:33.435 --> 35:34.393
How?

35:35.582 --> 35:37.107
When I went to the hotel,

35:37.108 --> 35:39.376
the clerk said she ordered
a car service.

35:40.718 --> 35:42.982
She had to cancel it
when she checked out.

35:43.435 --> 35:45.062
So what are you saying?

35:45.095 --> 35:47.504
Well, it's 6:00 A.M.,
which means wherever she is,

35:47.505 --> 35:49.895
she's getting ready
to leave for L.A.X., terminal 3.

35:49.896 --> 35:51.458
That's what the clerk said.

35:53.027 --> 35:54.909
What about Olivia?

35:55.081 --> 35:56.584
Saul gets here in 15 minutes

35:56.585 --> 35:58.405
to make his hollandaise sauce.

36:00.679 --> 36:03.390
My head's about to explode.

36:03.571 --> 36:04.895
Let's go.

36:13.412 --> 36:15.228
Sorry. I know it's early.

36:15.388 --> 36:17.217
Uh, yeah. Come on in.

36:20.232 --> 36:22.222
Hope you don't think
we're still going fishing.

36:22.598 --> 36:24.408
I'm leaving, Justin.

36:25.592 --> 36:26.435
Did you tell mom?

36:26.436 --> 36:31.226
I tried.
I tried again this morning, too.

36:31.543 --> 36:33.673
So... that's it?

36:33.674 --> 36:34.726
You... you're just gonna leave?

36:34.727 --> 36:36.638
It's better this way.

36:37.496 --> 36:40.155
You kids are everything to her.

36:40.156 --> 36:42.912
I'm not gonna throw a bomb
into the middle of this family.

36:42.913 --> 36:45.051
Brody, you don't even know
if you're her father.

36:45.052 --> 36:46.128
All right? At least get tested

36:46.129 --> 36:48.392
- before you take off...
- It's too late for that now.

36:49.186 --> 36:52.978
Sarah's better off
thinking that William is her dad.

36:53.753 --> 36:55.125
It's simpler...

36:55.212 --> 36:57.784
easier that way after all this time.

36:58.634 --> 37:02.173
And I need you to promise me
you'll never tell your mom.

37:02.452 --> 37:04.141
I... I can't do that.

37:04.142 --> 37:05.785
It has to be this way...

37:05.910 --> 37:07.370
for her sake.

37:08.611 --> 37:11.163
You realize you're gonna
break her heart, don't you?

37:13.706 --> 37:15.392
She has her family.

37:15.820 --> 37:17.456
She'll be okay.

37:24.017 --> 37:25.424
I'm gonna miss you guys.

37:26.156 --> 37:27.936
Take care of her for me.

37:43.751 --> 37:44.662
Anything?

37:45.623 --> 37:48.381
I've circled every
self check-in kiosk twice.

37:48.382 --> 37:51.147
I'm pretty sure the T.S.A.'s
about ready to strip-search me.

37:51.148 --> 37:52.728
Well, I guess she could've taken
a flight last night.

37:52.729 --> 37:54.867
Yeah. We always knew
it was a long shot.

37:55.596 --> 37:56.559
Should we go home?

37:56.560 --> 37:57.902
Okay. But first, I'm starving.

37:57.903 --> 37:59.530
You want to buy me
an overpriced pretzel?

37:59.531 --> 38:02.829
- Of course.
- Thanks.

38:37.345 --> 38:39.163
I'm glad we're staying here.

38:39.838 --> 38:41.266
When you love something,

38:42.151 --> 38:43.622
you never let it go.

38:46.057 --> 38:47.049
Mm.

39:24.075 --> 39:28.651
Brody's gone.

39:30.252 --> 39:32.043
He left me a note.

39:35.226 --> 39:37.419
He left me a damn note.

39:38.332 --> 39:39.480
Mom...

39:40.035 --> 39:41.838
I don't understand.

39:42.038 --> 39:44.104
He didn't even say good-bye.

39:44.105 --> 39:47.950
I don't understand.
Why did he do that?

39:52.101 --> 39:53.704
I don't know.

40:28.610 --> 40:30.463
I'm gonna have
to spin for three hours

40:30.464 --> 40:31.816
to get rid of this.

40:35.355 --> 40:36.443
- What?
- That's her.

40:36.444 --> 40:38.270
- What?
- Michelle!

40:38.271 --> 40:40.295
- Michelle!
- Oh, my God.

40:40.296 --> 40:41.228
Michelle!

40:41.229 --> 40:43.796
- Michelle!
- Excuse us. Michelle!

40:45.007 --> 40:46.267
I need your ticket and I.D., sir.

40:46.268 --> 40:48.172
- Uh, we have to get to our friend.
- Only ticketed passengers.

40:48.173 --> 40:49.946
No, you don't understand.
That could be our baby.

40:49.947 --> 40:51.350
- Michelle!
- Michelle!

40:51.351 --> 40:53.390
- Michelle! Michelle!
- Michelle!

40:54.595 --> 40:56.490
Michelle!
