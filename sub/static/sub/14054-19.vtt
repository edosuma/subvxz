00:02.719 --> 00:05.518
- <i>Previously on</i> The O.C.<i>:</i>
- I can't do this anymore. I don't trust you.

00:05.680 --> 00:06.908
Oliver's not stable. He's dangerous.

00:07.080 --> 00:09.674
Oliver has not done anything to Marissa
except be her friend. 

00:09.840 --> 00:12.149
Look, you guys may not believe me.
No one may believe me.

00:12.320 --> 00:13.435
- Theresa.
- Ryan Atwood.

00:13.600 --> 00:15.591
- So you two were...
- We grew up together.

00:16.520 --> 00:18.078
I always had a crush on you.

00:19.080 --> 00:20.069
You should go.

00:20.240 --> 00:22.708
I'm not gonna stand here and pretend
like I'm your girlfriend when I'm not.

00:22.920 --> 00:23.909
At least not anymore.

00:24.080 --> 00:26.310
Put the gun down,
you get a second chance.

00:26.480 --> 00:30.519
- I'm sorry. You were right.
- It's okay. It's okay.

00:43.360 --> 00:46.557
Happy Valentine's Day.
Someone just got struck by cupid's arrow.

00:47.160 --> 00:49.196
Happy Valentine's Day.

00:50.560 --> 00:53.438
- Valentine's Day's not till tomorrow.
- You're not excited?

00:53.600 --> 00:57.718
I am. I am. I'm just still thinking
about Oliver with that gun.

00:57.880 --> 00:59.836
- I know.
- Who knows what could've happened?

01:00.000 --> 01:02.514
But it didn't.
And Dr. Kim lifted Ryan's suspension.

01:02.680 --> 01:05.433
So the best thing is for
everything to return to normal.

01:05.600 --> 01:08.637
And in this house that means
celebrating the holidays.

01:08.800 --> 01:11.837
Valentine's Day is not a holiday.
Rosh Hashanah, that's a holiday.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.549
Memorial Day? Yes, a holiday.
You know who invented Valentine's Day?

01:15.720 --> 01:17.631
- St. Valentine.
- Hershey's and Hallmark.

01:17.800 --> 01:19.392
If you're single, it depresses you.

01:19.560 --> 01:22.199
If you are in love, start shelling out.
Chocolate. Flowers.

01:22.360 --> 01:24.157
- Lingerie.
- You never bought me lingerie.

01:24.320 --> 01:26.276
See how upset you are?
I hate this holiday.

01:26.440 --> 01:29.000
- Must be talking about Valentine's Day.
- I am. I hate it.

01:31.680 --> 01:34.956
- Hey. You got me.
- Guess who got shot by cupid's arrow.

01:35.120 --> 01:36.348
Is someone going overboard?

01:36.520 --> 01:38.431
You're one to talk.
Chrismukkah, anyone?

01:38.600 --> 01:41.194
- At least that's a real holiday.
- Tell her, Dad. It's two.

01:41.360 --> 01:43.828
- Seth made that word up when he was 6.
- It's an important...

01:44.000 --> 01:46.355
This is an important holiday.
It's Valentine's Day.

01:46.520 --> 01:49.318
- Where Jewishness fuses with Christianity.
- Do the math.

01:55.680 --> 01:58.752
- How you doing, kid?
- You know. Okay, I guess.

01:58.920 --> 02:03.357
You're about to be great. Tomorrow
is the big Valentine's Day Singles' Gala.

02:03.520 --> 02:05.715
A benefit for Newport Memorial's
Heart Department.

02:05.880 --> 02:09.235
Big party. You guys are gonna dress up.
Everyone's gonna be there.

02:09.400 --> 02:12.836
Just like normal, huh? Yes!

02:18.160 --> 02:19.149
I'm gonna go.

03:00.640 --> 03:03.359
- Ryan. Hey.
- Hey.

03:09.280 --> 03:10.679
Were you able to sleep at all?

03:10.840 --> 03:12.159
- Not much.
- Me either.

03:12.320 --> 03:14.880
- I kept going over everything in my head.
- Yeah.

03:15.040 --> 03:17.793
He's in the hospital,
so hopefully he'll get better.

03:17.960 --> 03:19.359
I hope so.

03:19.520 --> 03:23.513
I'm ready for everything to just
go back to normal. The way it was.

03:26.400 --> 03:29.631
Great. So, Valentine's Day tomorrow.

03:29.800 --> 03:31.916
- Yeah?
- What were you gonna do? Because...

03:32.080 --> 03:34.116
...I didn't know if you wanted to...
- Yeah, no.

03:34.280 --> 03:36.874
- Kirsten's hosting this singles' dance...
- For the hospital.

03:37.040 --> 03:39.110
I told her I'd go.
I didn't know if you wanted...

03:39.280 --> 03:40.554
Of course.

03:41.640 --> 03:44.393
Right. Well, then I'll go too.

03:45.920 --> 03:48.195
Who knows?
Maybe we'll meet somebody there.

03:48.360 --> 03:49.793
Yeah. Who knows?

03:53.760 --> 03:58.390
- All right. I should get to...
- Yeah. No. Me too.

04:17.760 --> 04:18.909
Hey, Summer.

04:19.079 --> 04:20.752
God, Cohen. You made me mess up.

04:20.920 --> 04:23.912
- I'm going for the high score.
- Hey, it's good to see you too.

04:24.080 --> 04:26.719
- Tomorrow's Valentine's Day.
- Oh, really?

04:26.880 --> 04:29.269
God. I didn't know tomorrow
was Valentine's Day.

04:29.440 --> 04:32.352
But thanks for reminding me.
Have fun with Anna.

04:32.520 --> 04:35.114
- Anna's in Pittsburgh for the weekend.
- On Valentine's Day?

04:35.280 --> 04:36.918
Hey, now that's commitment.

04:37.440 --> 04:40.716
Actually, Anna and I broke up.

04:40.920 --> 04:43.150
And I wanted to see
what you're doing tomorrow.

04:47.320 --> 04:49.276
- So you guys broke up.
- Yeah.

04:49.440 --> 04:53.353
Coffee. You're single now and you want
to know what I'm doing for Valentine's.

04:53.520 --> 04:55.078
- Yeah.
- So Anna dumps you...

04:55.240 --> 04:58.471
...and you think you can choose me
and I'd still be interested in you?

04:58.640 --> 05:01.757
First of all, what makes you think
that Anna dumped me?

05:01.920 --> 05:03.990
Never mind. Second of all...

05:04.480 --> 05:07.790
...kind of. Yes.
- Yeah. No. No way.

05:07.960 --> 05:10.110
I'm not gonna be your
sloppy seconds, ass-face.

05:10.400 --> 05:12.994
Besides, I'm busy tomorrow.
I'll be at the singles' dance.

05:13.160 --> 05:14.673
- So will I.
- I don't care.

05:14.840 --> 05:15.989
- See you there.
- Not if I see you first.

05:16.160 --> 05:19.835
- Maybe we'll both meet someone special.
- Yeah, as long as his name isn't Cohen.

05:21.680 --> 05:23.352
Snap.

05:25.600 --> 05:26.715
I'm sorry I'm late.

05:26.880 --> 05:29.758
Crusading for the rich and dysfunctional
is time-consuming.

05:29.920 --> 05:31.911
Let me just dot my I's and cross my T's.

05:32.080 --> 05:35.516
Come on, I'm starving. I've been thinking
about crab cakes for the last hour.

05:35.680 --> 05:37.591
Will you be around tomorrow
to help set up?

05:37.920 --> 05:40.593
- For what?
- The Valentine's Day Single Dance Gala.

05:40.760 --> 05:43.832
No. I can't do it.
I got this petty nuisance lawsuit. In fact...

05:44.440 --> 05:46.396
...I'm pretty booked this weekend.

05:46.560 --> 05:50.872
So I might be a little late to
the Valentine's Day Dance Singles' Gala.

05:51.040 --> 05:52.758
- Singles.
- Singles' Dance Gala.

05:53.280 --> 05:54.429
Why?

05:54.600 --> 05:56.909
- We said we'd go together.
- It's restaurant stuff.

05:57.080 --> 05:59.992
Got the zoning inspectors coming by
before we can expand the deck.

06:00.160 --> 06:02.754
- On Saturday?
- I guess these city council guys are busy.

06:02.920 --> 06:05.150
- No. I forbid it.
- You what?

06:05.320 --> 06:07.629
With whatever wifely authority
I have vested in me...

06:07.800 --> 06:10.234
...on this most holy
and romantic of days, no.

06:10.400 --> 06:14.837
- It's only a holiday. Not even a real one.
- Not this again. Not on an empty stomach.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.470
How about Arbor Day? Trees?
That's a good cause. Or Secretary's Day.

06:18.640 --> 06:21.393
- How about our anniversary?
- Which we might not make it to.

06:21.560 --> 06:23.630
You know you'll have more fun
without me.

06:23.800 --> 06:26.837
No. You're going.
Sandy, this is important to me.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.434
There's a lot of things
important to me that you don't do.

06:29.600 --> 06:30.794
- Like what?
- Like golfing.

06:30.960 --> 06:33.793
- Lots of couples golf together.
- Shortly before dying of old age.

06:33.960 --> 06:36.428
Surfing. How often have I tried
to get you in the ocean?

06:36.600 --> 06:39.637
- With the fish?
- And still I'm patient. I'm forgiving.

06:39.840 --> 06:41.876
- You're joking.
- I put up with your father.

06:42.040 --> 06:45.350
- You're eligible for sainthood any day.
- I forgive your snoring.

06:45.520 --> 06:47.988
- I do not snore.
- Yeah, you do.

06:48.160 --> 06:50.230
Like a freight train
roaring through the house.

06:50.400 --> 06:52.436
You wanted to do this restaurant,
I supported you.

06:52.600 --> 06:56.149
You wanted to go into private practice,
who had your back?

06:56.320 --> 06:59.630
- I put up with your father.
- You never wanna do anything I like.

06:59.800 --> 07:01.438
Everything's a fight, an argument.

07:01.600 --> 07:04.637
- My life, my job.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, and I'm still here.

07:04.800 --> 07:06.552
- Don't do me any favors.
- I won't.

07:06.720 --> 07:08.119
- Fine.
- Perfect.

07:08.960 --> 07:10.837
- What are we fighting about?
- I'm not sure.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.319
But it's serious.

07:12.680 --> 07:15.069
You're on your own for lunch.

07:16.120 --> 07:17.792
Happy Valentine's Day.

07:22.640 --> 07:24.790
Hey, kiddo.

07:25.240 --> 07:28.277
Plasterer came to the restaurant today.
Made a total mess.

07:28.440 --> 07:30.396
But progress is being made.

07:30.560 --> 07:32.835
- How's school?
- Okay.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.831
- Yeah?
- Hey, you got something.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.150
It was left for you at the door.

07:38.840 --> 07:42.913
Well, it's not ticking,
so it can't be from your mom.

07:43.760 --> 07:45.955
"Hope you're not too Ionely
this Valentine's Day.

07:46.120 --> 07:48.953
X O, X O. Your Secret Admirer."

07:49.120 --> 07:51.998
Marissa, you're so sweet.
You didn't have to do that.

07:52.160 --> 07:54.276
- I didn't.
- Well...

07:54.440 --> 07:57.079
...who else would've left something nice?
- Good question.

07:57.360 --> 08:00.557
This year I'm doing my best
to avoid Valentine's Day completely.

08:01.000 --> 08:05.118
- What? You and Ryan are...?
- I don't really want to talk about it.

08:05.280 --> 08:09.398
- And neither does he.
- Well, it is Valentine's Day.

08:09.560 --> 08:14.475
Sometimes the big romantic gesture
is more effective than talking.

08:16.160 --> 08:18.674
There's no way your mom
gave me these, right? No.

08:18.840 --> 08:22.037
She doesn't make her disdain for me
a secret. Much less her admiration.

08:22.200 --> 08:24.031
Well, have you kissed anyone recently?

08:25.280 --> 08:26.998
<i>Previously on</i> The Valley:

08:27.160 --> 08:29.594
<i>I just don 't feel like I fit</i>
<i>here in Tarzana.</i>

08:29.760 --> 08:31.432
I'm busy. Studying...

08:31.600 --> 08:33.318
...naked.

08:33.480 --> 08:36.073
Is that supposed to keep me away?

08:36.600 --> 08:38.238
Cohen?

08:41.200 --> 08:43.236
- You're at my house.
- And you're dressed.

08:43.400 --> 08:45.675
I wonder who's more disappointed.

08:46.120 --> 08:47.109
- Can I come in?
- No.

08:47.280 --> 08:48.315
Thanks.

08:49.240 --> 08:51.196
What are you doing here?

08:52.960 --> 08:54.109
Who's this?

08:54.280 --> 08:55.599
- No one.
- "I'm not no one."

08:55.760 --> 08:58.228
- Princess Sparkle. What do you want?
- She's Captain Oats' type.

08:58.400 --> 09:00.709
You tell him to keep his hooves off.
As for you...

09:00.880 --> 09:04.873
Wait, wait. Before you kick me out, can
you please give me a second to explain?

09:06.320 --> 09:08.550
Okay, listen. Summer...

09:10.240 --> 09:12.515
...it's not like...

09:12.680 --> 09:15.831
...now that me and Anna broke up
I'm now choosing you.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.592
Okay?

09:19.040 --> 09:22.476
Because the whole reason
that we broke up...

09:22.640 --> 09:24.676
...is because for me...

09:27.000 --> 09:29.434
...it's always been you, Summer.

09:29.600 --> 09:31.352
It's always been you.

09:31.520 --> 09:33.988
I've tried to fight it,
and I've tried to deny it.

09:34.160 --> 09:36.799
And I can't. I can't do it.

09:36.960 --> 09:38.871
You're undeniable.

09:54.720 --> 09:56.756
- Cohen?
- Yeah.

09:56.920 --> 09:58.638
Do you happen...

09:59.560 --> 10:01.357
...to have...

10:01.520 --> 10:03.476
...you know...?
- Oh...

10:04.520 --> 10:07.114
...yeah, I do. In my wallet.
- Yeah?

10:07.280 --> 10:11.353
I was beginning to view it as sort of
a rabbit's foot, for good luck only, but...

10:11.520 --> 10:13.750
You're about to get lucky.

10:20.600 --> 10:22.989
Whatever you say, Summer. Yes.

10:23.320 --> 10:24.992
Yes.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.309
- Luke. Hi.
- Hi, Mrs. Cooper.

10:43.040 --> 10:44.837
What are you doing here?

10:48.160 --> 10:51.755
Do you know...? I was wondering,
did Marissa bring her bio textbook home?

10:51.920 --> 10:55.071
Marissa doesn't live here anymore, Luke.
You know that.

10:55.280 --> 10:57.714
Right. I must have forgot.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.549
Right. Okay. Well, good night.

11:03.200 --> 11:07.637
Tomorrow is the Valentine's Day party.
Are you gonna go?

11:07.800 --> 11:11.588
Because I'm gonna go.
And I thought if you needed a ride...

11:12.320 --> 11:14.788
Actually, everything that's happened
with Caleb and me...

11:14.960 --> 11:17.269
...I think it's best I stay home.
Avoid this holiday.

11:17.440 --> 11:18.714
Yeah.

11:18.880 --> 11:21.110
It's just another day of the week, right?

11:23.200 --> 11:25.077
Okay.

11:25.240 --> 11:28.312
- Good night, Mrs. Cooper.
- Good night.

11:40.720 --> 11:42.199
So...

11:42.360 --> 11:44.157
...that was sex.

11:44.640 --> 11:46.232
Yep.

11:47.680 --> 11:50.274
- I'm gonna go.
- Me too.

11:50.440 --> 11:51.839
But you live here.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.911
I meant downstairs.

11:54.080 --> 11:55.399
Okay.

11:55.560 --> 11:57.152
Perfect.

12:17.680 --> 12:19.113
Hi.

12:27.200 --> 12:29.430
I love you so much.

12:31.880 --> 12:34.394
We've waited a long time to...

12:34.560 --> 12:39.873
...you know, and I thought maybe
we could start Valentine's Day early.

12:43.200 --> 12:45.760
- No. Wait. Wait. Hold on.
- What?

12:45.920 --> 12:47.638
Don't you want to?

12:47.800 --> 12:49.233
No.

12:51.160 --> 12:52.798
No. I mean, yeah.

12:52.960 --> 12:54.473
Yeah, of course.

12:55.200 --> 12:57.760
But with everything that's happened,
it just...

12:57.920 --> 13:01.151
- It seems a little soon.
- I just wish it hadn't happened.

13:01.320 --> 13:03.959
That we could still be like we were...

13:05.520 --> 13:08.671
...and I wanted to make it up to you.
- You don't have to...

13:08.840 --> 13:10.717
...do this.

13:11.560 --> 13:13.357
No. You're right.

13:13.520 --> 13:16.876
So I guess I'll go.

13:17.040 --> 13:19.076
- Because this is just really...
- Wrong?

13:20.040 --> 13:22.873
I was gonna say "embarrassing."
But I guess "wrong" works.

13:23.040 --> 13:28.398
So it was nice to see you.
And I guess I'll see you again tomorrow.

13:40.680 --> 13:44.753
- Hey, buddy. Got some big news.
- I was about to go set up. You coming?

13:44.920 --> 13:46.751
It's a lot of lifting. It's not my thing.

13:46.920 --> 13:49.832
I don't know if I just mentioned this,
but I have some big news.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.992
- Yeah, so I heard. What's up?
- Ryan, I'm a man now.

13:53.160 --> 13:56.197
Not just like an after-your-bar-mitzvah
man, but a "man" man.

13:56.360 --> 14:00.114
I had sex with a girl.
Summer, to be more specific.

14:00.280 --> 14:02.157
How was it?

14:02.760 --> 14:04.318
- I had sex.
- That bad?

14:04.880 --> 14:07.792
No, not that bad...

14:07.960 --> 14:09.951
...just kind of weird.
- Weird?

14:10.120 --> 14:13.635
Yeah, but not kinky weird.
More like weird awkward.

14:13.800 --> 14:16.678
But, hey, it was my first time.
She's a more experienced woman.

14:16.840 --> 14:17.989
That's to be expected.

14:18.160 --> 14:22.790
And I did make some faces in the middle
that I wish I could take back, but I can't.

14:22.960 --> 14:26.396
There was also sort of a whiny noise
that came out towards the end...

14:26.840 --> 14:30.355
...that probably wasn't my finest hour.
I sucked so bad.

14:30.520 --> 14:33.273
I was like a fish flopping around
on dry land.

14:33.440 --> 14:37.319
Ryan, I was Nemo.
And I just wanted to go home.

14:37.560 --> 14:41.314
- Don't worry. You'll get another chance.
- That's the thing. I'm not sure I will.

14:41.480 --> 14:45.792
The situation with Summer is murkier now
than it was before the awful fish sex.

14:45.960 --> 14:47.518
I wouldn't refer to it as fish sex.

14:47.680 --> 14:50.558
Good point. That's something
I was hoping to get more of: Tips.

14:50.720 --> 14:54.030
Tricks of the trade. Summer's used to
driving a higher performance vehicle.

14:54.200 --> 14:56.430
Don't know if I'm the guy
to talk to about romance.

14:56.600 --> 14:57.794
- Why?
- Me and Marissa.

14:57.960 --> 15:00.872
- It's different now, post-Oliver.
- Yeah? You wanna talk about it?

15:01.040 --> 15:03.395
- No, I should get over to set up.
- Hey.

15:03.560 --> 15:05.630
So do you have tips
or words of wisdom for me?

15:05.800 --> 15:07.279
Do it again.

15:08.480 --> 15:10.710
That's what I was afraid of.

15:12.840 --> 15:17.436
And then we both just decided to wait.
Because, you know, we were really tired.

15:17.600 --> 15:19.477
Well, you know how it goes.

15:22.280 --> 15:25.078
- I wish we had waited.
- What? Who?

15:25.640 --> 15:27.517
Me and Cohen.

15:27.800 --> 15:29.836
- We had sex.
- Wait, what?

15:30.200 --> 15:31.679
You guys did what?

15:31.840 --> 15:34.115
I've been with you an hour.
How did this not come up?

15:34.280 --> 15:35.998
I must have forgotten.

15:41.600 --> 15:44.353
Okay, so I lied.

15:44.520 --> 15:48.559
Things last night with Ryan went terribly.
I think he hates me.

15:48.720 --> 15:50.711
- He doesn't hate you.
- He turned down sex.

15:50.880 --> 15:52.677
He might be onto something.

15:56.720 --> 15:59.598
Hey. You can't beat yourself up over it.

15:59.760 --> 16:02.672
No one knew that Oliver would
turn out to be such a Looney Tune.

16:02.840 --> 16:05.354
Except Ryan, and I didn't listen.

16:06.400 --> 16:07.719
I don't know.

16:08.720 --> 16:11.917
Maybe we just weren't meant
to be together.

16:12.320 --> 16:15.312
Maybe we're just chasing after
the wrong boys.

16:24.400 --> 16:25.992
Hello.

16:41.720 --> 16:44.996
- How long will this continue?
- You've ruined my favorite holiday.

16:45.160 --> 16:48.391
So until Valentine's Day is over,
we have nothing to talk about.

16:48.760 --> 16:50.557
- All right.
- Hey, Dad. Are you busy?

16:50.720 --> 16:54.395
- Just enjoying your mother's company.
- Awesome, I need to talk to you.

16:54.560 --> 16:57.472
- What's going on?
- Nothing. Just need to talk to you.

16:58.160 --> 16:59.912
- Girl stuff.
- Well...

17:00.080 --> 17:01.877
...you've come to the master.

17:03.800 --> 17:05.153
Hey, I got you.

17:05.319 --> 17:07.071
I was young, impressionable and drunk.

17:07.240 --> 17:09.310
Yeah, only child. Right here.

17:10.280 --> 17:13.715
I'll get it. I need a little fresh air.

17:16.359 --> 17:18.589
I never thought that I would have to...

17:19.400 --> 17:22.153
...say this, but I think that we...

17:22.599 --> 17:24.989
...need to have the talk.

17:26.160 --> 17:29.072
- Now?
- It'll be as hard for me as it is for you.

17:30.360 --> 17:32.828
Hey. Happy Valentine's Day.

17:33.000 --> 17:36.197
That's what I like.
A little holiday spirit around here.

17:36.360 --> 17:37.998
- Thanks.
- Sure.

17:38.160 --> 17:40.515
I love these.
You know what they're called?

17:40.680 --> 17:44.195
Forgotten Kisses. And you know
who used to make these? Hailey.

17:44.360 --> 17:45.839
Hailey?

17:46.000 --> 17:48.309
And how's she doing?
You heard from her at all?

17:48.480 --> 17:52.029
No, and I don't expect I will.
Because when she left, she left angry.

17:52.280 --> 17:54.316
Who knows, she's probably in
Asia or New York.

17:54.480 --> 17:56.710
- Quite the globetrotter.
- Sometimes.

17:56.880 --> 17:59.553
Once we thought she was in London,
but she was on a friend's boat...

17:59.720 --> 18:02.632
...just down here in the harbor.
- Boat, huh?

18:04.680 --> 18:05.874
Well...

18:06.040 --> 18:09.510
...did you, you know...?
Did you...

18:09.800 --> 18:11.711
...wear protection?

18:12.520 --> 18:13.999
Oh, my God. Yes.

18:14.160 --> 18:16.071
God, yes. I don't believe
you asked me that.

18:16.240 --> 18:18.470
I'm sorry, but I had to.
It's so good that you did.

18:18.640 --> 18:20.949
If you're gonna have sex,
you gotta be responsible.

18:21.120 --> 18:24.430
- Yes. Responsible and awkward.
- Well, that's to be expected.

18:24.880 --> 18:26.108
- It is?
- Yeah.

18:26.280 --> 18:27.838
- That's what I thought.
- Listen...

18:28.000 --> 18:31.072
...you were lucky to be able to hang
in there after all that foreplay.

18:31.600 --> 18:33.192
Fore-what now?

18:34.080 --> 18:35.559
Foreplay.

18:35.720 --> 18:39.599
Oh, yeah. You know.

18:40.680 --> 18:42.830
Massaging. You know...

18:43.960 --> 18:47.999
...or nibbling the neck. Here's the point,
just because you're ready to go...

18:48.160 --> 18:50.549
...it doesn't mean she is.
- I'm always ready to go.

18:50.720 --> 18:53.917
Well, you're my son.
We Cohens are very sexual beings.

18:54.080 --> 18:56.116
- Oh, my God.
- Virile. Get used to it.

18:56.280 --> 18:58.271
Just disgusting.

18:58.840 --> 19:02.071
- Foreplay, huh?
- I'm telling you...

19:02.240 --> 19:05.198
...the appetizer is as good
as the main course.

19:05.360 --> 19:06.873
Just swallowed a bit of throw up.

19:07.040 --> 19:09.918
Well, I'm gonna pretend we never
had this conversation...

19:10.080 --> 19:13.197
...but thanks, Dad.
- Hey, Seth. Seth, so...

19:14.400 --> 19:16.960
...do you mind my asking?
Who'd you...?

19:17.120 --> 19:20.954
Who'd you sleep with? I mean,
you got so many girls these days.

19:21.280 --> 19:22.793
Summer?

19:22.960 --> 19:24.712
You dog, you.

19:33.600 --> 19:36.512
So, man, how's everything
with you and Marissa?

19:36.680 --> 19:40.309
- Is she coming to the party tonight?
- I don't know. Fifty-fifty.

19:41.080 --> 19:43.958
What about her mom?
You think she's coming tonight?

19:44.120 --> 19:45.997
I have no idea.

19:47.400 --> 19:50.437
I was just trying to get a head count
for the event.

19:54.600 --> 19:56.716
Whoa. Whoa. Sorry.

19:57.720 --> 20:00.678
- Ryan.
- Theresa.

20:01.080 --> 20:04.914
- What are...? Hi.
- You always had a way with words.

20:07.400 --> 20:08.833
- Are you working here?
- Yeah.

20:09.000 --> 20:13.755
What better way to celebrate Valentine's
than serve p ðt Á to a bunch of rich people?

20:13.920 --> 20:17.993
Oh, these are your friends
and neighbors. Sorry.

20:19.080 --> 20:20.752
It's good to see you.

20:26.600 --> 20:28.431
Cohen. What are you doing?

20:28.600 --> 20:30.431
I need to talk to you...

20:30.600 --> 20:32.033
...about what happened.

20:32.200 --> 20:33.918
You remember the...

20:34.680 --> 20:36.671
...sex?
- I'm trying to forget.

20:36.840 --> 20:39.229
Right. Right.
That's actually why I'm here.

20:39.400 --> 20:41.277
I feel you didn't get your money's worth.

20:41.440 --> 20:43.317
Make a bang-for-your-buck joke,
you're gone.

20:43.480 --> 20:46.870
No jokes.
There should be nothing funny about...

20:47.040 --> 20:48.632
...what goes on right here.

20:48.800 --> 20:49.949
You want another shot?

20:50.320 --> 20:52.276
That's what I'm saying.

21:02.440 --> 21:03.668
Pretty good.

21:03.840 --> 21:05.592
Not as slobbery as yesterday.

21:11.400 --> 21:13.789
- A little tense there.
- Ow, what are you...?

21:14.200 --> 21:18.478
- What's up with the Vulcan nerve pinch?
- A little massage.

21:21.720 --> 21:24.029
Okay. No. You're totally tickling me.

21:24.200 --> 21:25.633
Stop.

21:26.080 --> 21:29.914
- Stop.
- Stopping. Stopping.

21:32.720 --> 21:34.392
Okay, what the hell are you doing?

21:34.560 --> 21:36.630
A little something
that I like to call foreplay.

21:36.800 --> 21:38.233
No.

21:38.400 --> 21:40.118
I knew not to listen to my dad.

21:40.280 --> 21:43.158
Not that I listen to him.
I'd never talk about that with him.

21:43.320 --> 21:46.392
- You know what I'm saying.
- No more talking, Cohen.

21:47.400 --> 21:48.753
Whatever you say, Summer.

21:49.840 --> 21:53.628
So now he's in the hospital.
He'll be there a while.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.560
Wow. That's unbelievable.

21:56.720 --> 21:59.712
- No wonder you're so pissed off.
- No, I'm not.

21:59.880 --> 22:03.395
Sure you are. I'd be.
Your best friend didn't believe you.

22:03.560 --> 22:07.712
People you live with didn't listen to you.
And your girlfriend didn't trust you.

22:07.880 --> 22:09.518
When you put it that way...

22:11.000 --> 22:13.116
Sorry, it's none of my business.

22:14.080 --> 22:17.470
No, it feels good to talk about it.

22:17.640 --> 22:19.517
I haven't, really, with anyone else.

22:26.600 --> 22:27.874
Hey.

22:28.040 --> 22:29.439
Luke didn't know if you'd...

22:30.760 --> 22:31.988
Hi, Marissa.

22:32.160 --> 22:34.435
Theresa. Thanksgiving. We...

22:34.600 --> 22:37.956
- Yeah. No, I remember.
- I'm helping cater the event.

22:38.120 --> 22:39.348
She's a caterer.

22:39.520 --> 22:42.432
Oh, well, that's really great.

22:43.880 --> 22:46.189
So I guess I'll just talk to you tonight.

22:46.400 --> 22:48.311
- You'll be here?
- Yeah.

22:49.360 --> 22:51.396
- And so will you.
- Yeah.

22:51.560 --> 22:53.278
Okay. Bye.

22:53.640 --> 22:56.438
- I should get back too.
- Yeah, see you tonight.

23:02.880 --> 23:04.472
Sorry.

23:19.160 --> 23:21.799
One day, when I'm reflecting
back on my life...

23:21.960 --> 23:25.316
...I think I'll remember these chats
before big events as my favorite times.

23:25.480 --> 23:27.198
What's this one about?

23:29.240 --> 23:32.232
- What did you do to your eye?
- It's just a little bit blurry.

23:32.400 --> 23:35.278
- Summer poked me in it with her big toe.
- What? Why?

23:35.440 --> 23:38.512
Accident. There were limbs everywhere.
I'm lucky I can still see.

23:38.880 --> 23:42.634
- So you guys did the deed again?
- Technically, yes. But it wasn't pretty.

23:42.800 --> 23:46.475
- I think I suffered a spinal injury too.
- Next time you should wear a helmet.

23:46.640 --> 23:49.438
- Mouth guard.
- I don't think there will be a next time.

23:49.920 --> 23:53.117
Not after this latest debacle.
I think it might be over.

23:53.280 --> 23:57.478
And what sucks about that, though, is
that I know I have so much more to give.

23:57.640 --> 23:59.596
- I don't need to know that.
- Fair enough.

23:59.760 --> 24:01.398
What about you?
Wanna skip the event?

24:01.560 --> 24:03.630
I would, but there's someone
I wanna see.

24:04.920 --> 24:06.114
Just an old friend.

24:06.480 --> 24:09.552
If you want to skip it,
I'd be more than happy to. Believe me.

24:09.760 --> 24:11.478
- I don't want to go either.
- Great.

24:11.640 --> 24:14.200
But I have to.
Ryan's ex is gonna be there.

24:14.360 --> 24:17.989
- She's a caterer tonight.
- And you want to what, spy?

24:18.280 --> 24:20.077
Not exactly.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.313
Yes.

24:22.480 --> 24:25.790
Look, I don't know, Summ.
I don't know what's going on between us.

24:25.960 --> 24:28.155
And now this girl is gonna be there.

24:28.320 --> 24:29.719
Hug?

24:31.280 --> 24:33.840
- Are you limping?
- Yeah. Cohen kneed me in the leg.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.958
- Why?
- Must've read it in the <i>Kamasutra.</i>

24:37.120 --> 24:39.873
- So you guys had sex again?
- Lf you can call it that.

24:40.040 --> 24:43.157
There were, like, limbs everywhere.

24:43.320 --> 24:45.595
- Love hurts.
- Yeah, tell me about it.

24:56.720 --> 24:59.314
- You a cop?
- No.

24:59.480 --> 25:02.552
No, I'm just looking for someone
who's staying here.

25:02.720 --> 25:04.790
- Jimmy.
- Hey. Hailey.

25:09.320 --> 25:12.278
Okay. Interesting company
you keep there.

25:12.440 --> 25:14.749
You tracked me down. I'm impressed.

25:14.920 --> 25:18.276
Those cookies were so good
that I couldn't let you leave without...

25:18.440 --> 25:22.194
...giving me the recipe. Definitely gonna
be on the menu of my new restaurant.

25:22.360 --> 25:24.555
- Your new restaurant?
- In fact, I was wondering...

25:24.720 --> 25:27.757
...if you wanted to be
the first customer.

25:28.360 --> 25:30.157
I'm experimenting with some dishes.

25:30.320 --> 25:33.232
And I thought maybe, you know,
you could be the guinea pig.

25:33.400 --> 25:36.073
Okay. Let me go get changed.

25:36.400 --> 25:38.038
I'll be right back.

25:44.480 --> 25:46.516
Maybe a couple months.
He's only in...

25:46.680 --> 25:48.477
Take care. I'll see you soon.

25:50.520 --> 25:52.272
All right.

25:52.440 --> 25:56.228
Hey. If I teach you guys anything,
don't ever get married.

25:56.400 --> 25:58.868
- I've heard that from you before.
- You'll hear it again.

25:59.040 --> 26:00.632
I'll be at the bar.

26:01.680 --> 26:02.999
No sign of our opponents.

26:03.160 --> 26:05.913
- You ready to go?
- Yeah. Since before we got here.

26:06.080 --> 26:07.308
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, there.

26:07.480 --> 26:11.109
Want some of this...?
I actually have no idea what this is.

26:11.280 --> 26:14.590
Odds are, mushroom leek crescent,
crab and brie phyllo. Usually is.

26:14.760 --> 26:16.671
Seth, this is my friend Theresa.

26:16.840 --> 26:20.549
Oh, this is your friend Theresa?
Hi. How are you? I'm gonna go with...

26:20.720 --> 26:22.995
- That's her.
- That's her?

26:23.160 --> 26:24.991
She's hot.

26:25.160 --> 26:26.559
For Chino.

26:26.720 --> 26:29.393
No. She is. She's beautiful...

26:29.560 --> 26:33.838
...and nice and smart and funny, and did
I mention they've been friends forever?

26:34.000 --> 26:36.309
- Only a few times.
- They did musicals together.

26:36.480 --> 26:38.948
- And went to the winter dance.
- Ryan did musicals?

26:39.120 --> 26:41.395
She was Peppermint Patty.

26:41.560 --> 26:43.551
Ryan was Snoopy.

26:48.760 --> 26:50.273
God, I hate Valentine's Day.

26:50.440 --> 26:53.193
I don't know why we celebrate anything
around here.

26:53.960 --> 26:56.713
- My dad didn't show up, huh?
- Nope.

26:56.880 --> 27:00.555
I'm gonna go home, run a bath, and either
slit my wrists or drink a bottle of wine.

27:00.720 --> 27:02.472
Wine. Definitely.

27:02.640 --> 27:06.155
Good thing Kaitlin's at a sleepover.
I'll be blasting Bob Seger tonight.

27:06.320 --> 27:08.231
We'll keep our windows closed.

27:08.400 --> 27:10.391
- Bye.
- Bye.

27:31.960 --> 27:34.997
Can we just start over?

27:36.800 --> 27:38.153
Start over?

27:38.320 --> 27:41.357
Hi. I'm Marissa.
You go to Harbor, right?

27:48.960 --> 27:50.678
I know what you're trying to do.

27:53.560 --> 27:55.232
And I can't.

27:57.920 --> 27:59.319
I'm sorry.

28:10.560 --> 28:12.915
Can I talk to you for a second?

28:13.080 --> 28:16.072
- Look, if you want another shot...
- No. No. Believe me.

28:16.240 --> 28:18.310
I get it. Clearly...

28:18.480 --> 28:21.358
...something's not working.
It's me. It's fine. It's my fault.

28:22.400 --> 28:25.312
- What are you trying to say?
- Maybe in a few years, you know?

28:25.480 --> 28:27.311
I'll be...

28:28.240 --> 28:30.629
I guess I'll be ready for you,
I don't know.

28:32.200 --> 28:34.589
But in the meantime,
I think I'm just gonna...

28:34.760 --> 28:36.591
I'm just gonna bow out.

28:43.040 --> 28:46.919
No, that's not asbestos.
Those are called floaties.

28:47.080 --> 28:49.958
Asbestos and champagne.

28:50.120 --> 28:51.553
What could be more romantic?

28:51.720 --> 28:56.748
It's a work in progress. There's actually
nothing on the menu right now.

28:56.920 --> 28:58.797
But the cookies are good.

28:59.280 --> 29:02.113
- This place is gonna be great, Jimmy.
- Yeah. I know.

29:02.280 --> 29:05.636
I feel for the first time in a while
that my life is... It's coming together.

29:05.960 --> 29:08.394
So I don't understand, you know...

29:08.560 --> 29:11.074
...I thought you couldn't
get out of here fast enough.

29:11.240 --> 29:13.356
Yeah...

29:13.520 --> 29:16.432
...until I realized I had nowhere to go.

29:16.720 --> 29:19.917
- No one to see.
- Hailey, you can get stuck here.

29:20.080 --> 29:23.516
You drive down the same streets,
go to the same places. It feels like...

29:23.680 --> 29:27.559
...time isn't passing, but it is.
And it'll pass you right by.

29:27.720 --> 29:30.473
You owe it to yourself.
Get out. Get free.

29:30.640 --> 29:33.791
- Make a life for yourself.
- Why do I need to leave?

29:33.960 --> 29:35.632
You're here.

29:36.600 --> 29:38.431
Exactly.

29:39.440 --> 29:42.000
I mean, you know, we can't...

29:43.040 --> 29:44.473
Well...

29:44.880 --> 29:47.474
...why not?
- Because I feel guilty enough...

29:47.640 --> 29:50.154
...lying to Kirsten about the cookies...

29:50.320 --> 29:52.390
...let alone...

29:53.720 --> 29:55.278
Right.

29:56.520 --> 29:58.272
But believe me...

29:59.240 --> 30:00.958
...I wish we could.

30:01.720 --> 30:03.711
I believe you.

30:10.400 --> 30:11.879
Hey.

30:12.680 --> 30:14.079
You okay?

30:17.880 --> 30:20.155
- Cigarette?
- I quit.

30:21.840 --> 30:24.718
Ryan Atwood. Look at yourself.

30:25.080 --> 30:27.469
New clothes. New haircut.

30:27.640 --> 30:29.949
Dating the homecoming queen.

30:31.080 --> 30:33.071
Was dating?

30:33.280 --> 30:34.554
I guess. I don't know.

30:38.040 --> 30:40.759
- I like the haircut, by the way.
- Yeah?

30:44.400 --> 30:46.630
You ever think about coming home?

30:47.520 --> 30:49.272
Sometimes.

30:49.440 --> 30:51.317
More lately.

30:51.480 --> 30:53.550
You ever think about leaving?

30:53.720 --> 30:56.996
Yeah. All the time.
But I don't know how.

30:58.600 --> 31:00.909
So when you took
this particular catering job...

31:01.080 --> 31:03.116
I needed the money.

31:04.440 --> 31:06.158
And, yes...

31:06.320 --> 31:08.550
...I was hoping I might run into you.

31:08.720 --> 31:10.039
Home's Ionely these days.

31:17.520 --> 31:18.999
Are you on a break?

31:19.160 --> 31:20.912
Yeah. I'm free until cleanup.

31:21.080 --> 31:22.752
You wanna get out of here?

31:35.160 --> 31:37.230
Is it okay if I hang here?

31:37.920 --> 31:40.957
Yeah. Sure. Of course.

31:43.440 --> 31:46.557
Valentine's Day is wonderful, isn't it?

31:48.080 --> 31:52.392
- You know, the thing about Ryan...
- No, this isn't...

31:52.720 --> 31:54.711
- It's not... I'm fine.
- I know.

31:54.880 --> 31:58.953
But the thing about Ryan is,
whenever things have gotten tough...

31:59.120 --> 32:02.157
...everyone in his life has abandoned him.
- That's what he thinks I did.

32:02.320 --> 32:03.719
Surprise him. Show him you didn't.

32:04.080 --> 32:06.514
- That you're not gonna give up on him.
- He wants me to.

32:06.680 --> 32:09.990
Well, only because he expects you to.
It's crazy.

32:10.320 --> 32:11.514
Love is crazy.

32:11.680 --> 32:14.319
It's always challenging. It's never easy.

32:14.480 --> 32:17.278
- Yeah, but is it always this hard?
- Sometimes.

32:17.440 --> 32:19.431
But you hang in there anyway.

32:19.600 --> 32:21.795
If you're having the worst fight
in the world...

32:21.960 --> 32:25.748
...or some stupid argument that neither
of you can remember what it's about.

32:25.920 --> 32:27.592
Because it's...

32:27.760 --> 32:29.512
It's worth it.

32:31.480 --> 32:33.596
You guys have been
through so much already.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.911
Why quit now?

32:38.800 --> 32:40.438
- Hey, Mr. Cohen.
- Hello, Summer.

32:40.600 --> 32:43.353
- Hi. Coop, you ready to go?
- Yeah.

32:43.520 --> 32:45.829
- You okay, kiddo?
- Yeah. Thanks.

32:54.200 --> 32:57.556
- Sometimes you make it hard to hate you.
- I know.

32:57.720 --> 33:00.712
It's all... It's all... It's part of my charm.

33:00.880 --> 33:03.189
Sometimes you make it easy.

33:05.080 --> 33:08.629
- Charming too, no?
- Let's go home.

33:29.760 --> 33:32.194
You tried to jump that fence
and your pants got caught.

33:32.360 --> 33:33.509
I was pretty graceful.

33:33.680 --> 33:36.911
- Yeah, especially when you face-planted.
- Glad to see you enjoy my pain.

33:37.080 --> 33:39.833
We had no ice and we had to use
that bag of frozen peas.

33:40.000 --> 33:43.197
Yeah. Frozen vegetables.
The miracle cure.

33:45.560 --> 33:49.075
It's pretty amazing, us running into
each other on Valentine's Day.

33:52.360 --> 33:55.033
I gotta get back. Help clean up.

33:56.400 --> 33:59.198
So do you go to a lot
of these kinds of events?

34:00.200 --> 34:02.236
Pretty much every week.

34:02.760 --> 34:05.433
Well, then maybe I'll run into you again.

34:06.280 --> 34:08.793
Plus, I know where you live.

34:14.320 --> 34:16.958
- Oh, God.
- I know I shouldn't be here.

34:17.280 --> 34:19.714
- No, you shouldn't, Luke.
- But it's just...

34:19.880 --> 34:21.871
I don't know,
you looked so sad when you left.

34:22.040 --> 34:25.350
I couldn't bear the thought of you
being alone on Valentine's Day.

34:25.520 --> 34:28.034
Most people would enjoy that thought.

34:28.199 --> 34:29.757
Not me.

34:30.600 --> 34:33.989
Mrs. Cooper, you are an amazing girl.

34:35.480 --> 34:36.913
Woman.

34:37.400 --> 34:38.913
Lady.

34:39.280 --> 34:42.556
- Lf Mr. Nichol doesn't appreciate you...
- No. He sure doesn't.

34:42.719 --> 34:46.554
That's because he's too old to see
what he's lucky enough to have.

34:49.400 --> 34:53.393
And you should also know that
you have always been the coolest mom.

34:53.600 --> 34:55.716
- Luke.
- It's true. You let us listen to...

34:55.880 --> 35:00.271
...whatever we wanted to in the carpool.
And you let us watch R-rated movies.

35:00.440 --> 35:05.036
- And whenever we played Ultimatum...
- Ultimatum?

35:06.280 --> 35:10.956
You know, who, of all your
friends' moms, would you rather do?

35:12.000 --> 35:14.912
- That's a game?
- And whenever we played it...

35:15.080 --> 35:18.197
...you always won.
- Really?

35:18.760 --> 35:21.593
- I beat Kirsten?
- I thought you should know the truth...

35:21.760 --> 35:23.796
...on Valentine's Day.

35:26.280 --> 35:27.918
- Good night.
- Wait.

35:40.640 --> 35:41.868
Thank you.

36:06.280 --> 36:08.191
Would you like to come in?

36:16.680 --> 36:19.717
I guess you're happy that today is over.

36:19.880 --> 36:21.711
Absolutely.

36:30.080 --> 36:32.674
Oh, my God, Sandy.

36:32.960 --> 36:36.316
Somebody's got to keep
Hershey's and Hallmark in business.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.719
- So you want to be my Valentine?
- Yes.

36:46.880 --> 36:51.237
Just as soon as I have some of these
caramel chocolates. They're my favorite.

36:51.400 --> 36:54.039
The square ones.
I like the ones with nuts.

36:55.880 --> 36:59.668
Not to rub it in, man,
but I think Princess Sparkle is your type.

36:59.920 --> 37:02.115
Yeah, I blew it for us both.

37:02.440 --> 37:03.589
What's that?

37:03.760 --> 37:05.591
Yeah. Are you kidding?
Great hooves.

37:06.960 --> 37:09.520
- Cohen?
- Summer.

37:09.680 --> 37:11.511
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:14.480 --> 37:15.879
No.

37:18.920 --> 37:20.558
The other night...

37:21.320 --> 37:22.878
...when we...

37:23.360 --> 37:26.113
...had sex.
- Yeah.

37:27.680 --> 37:29.875
You weren't the only virgin in the room.

37:30.480 --> 37:32.789
There was someone else in the room?
Like, filming us?

37:32.960 --> 37:34.837
Me, jackass.

37:35.160 --> 37:37.469
I'm a virgin.

37:37.640 --> 37:40.029
Or I was a virgin.

37:42.640 --> 37:44.517
Why didn't you tell me?

37:44.680 --> 37:46.716
I don't know.

37:46.960 --> 37:51.556
I guess I felt like
I had this reputation to uphold...

37:52.040 --> 37:55.112
...and I figured you'd think less of me.
- No.

37:55.400 --> 37:59.075
Are you kidding? Not at all.
I'm just... I'm shocked.

37:59.640 --> 38:04.236
God. Never in a million years would I
think that you, of all people, not that...

38:04.400 --> 38:06.755
That is not what's important here.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.753
This was a huge moment in our lives
and we just blew past it.

38:10.920 --> 38:12.876
- Really quickly.
- Hey, not that quickly.

38:14.240 --> 38:16.196
Pretty quickly, yes.

38:17.360 --> 38:19.078
And it was a big deal.

38:19.240 --> 38:22.357
I think that it should've been special.

38:22.520 --> 38:24.397
And we rushed it.

38:26.760 --> 38:28.796
What if...

38:29.320 --> 38:31.709
...we were to slow it down a little bit?

38:32.320 --> 38:34.276
Maybe...

38:34.640 --> 38:36.676
...start from the beginning?

38:37.160 --> 38:38.752
What do you mean?

38:52.200 --> 38:55.909
- You are so cheesy, Cohen.
- Come on.

38:56.080 --> 38:58.275
I'm sweeping you off your feet.

38:59.720 --> 39:03.156
Well, the sad part is...

39:04.120 --> 39:05.997
...you kind of are.

39:37.240 --> 39:39.151
- Where is she?
- What?

39:39.320 --> 39:42.995
Theresa. If she's here, I want her
to know I'm not gonna lose you.

39:43.160 --> 39:45.230
I'm not gonna give up on you.

39:45.400 --> 39:47.197
She left.

39:48.320 --> 39:51.392
- I'm so sorry.
- I know.

39:59.640 --> 40:01.835
Can't you just forgive me?

40:02.960 --> 40:04.359
How?

40:07.440 --> 40:09.317
I don't know...

40:10.240 --> 40:12.276
...if we should be together.

40:13.280 --> 40:18.434
I mean, look how easy it was for someone
to come into our lives, come between us.

40:20.640 --> 40:23.438
- How do I know it won't happen again?
- It won't.

40:23.600 --> 40:26.068
- You have to trust me.
- Like you trusted me.

40:27.760 --> 40:29.318
Ryan.

40:32.960 --> 40:34.393
So that's it?

40:37.080 --> 40:39.548
I can't pretend it didn't happen.
