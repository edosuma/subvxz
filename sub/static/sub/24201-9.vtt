01:57.166 --> 01:59.375
I'm Larry Your-Waiter. Deviled egg?

01:59.458 --> 02:04.458
Hello, hello, hello!
Don't mind if I do. Don't mind if I do.

02:04.541 --> 02:08.625
The Mamba du Mal is
one of the deadliest snakes in the world,

02:08.708 --> 02:12.625
which is why I'm training them to send
and receive secret messages.

02:14.708 --> 02:16.500
Say something, Dr. Montgomery.

02:16.583 --> 02:21.666
In the words of a very wise
and talkative Tibetan Monk-Snake,

02:21.750 --> 02:24.875
"Life is a conundrum of esoterica."

02:31.416 --> 02:35.875
Georgina! You're looking fabulous.
How do you get the handsomest dates?

02:35.958 --> 02:39.083
It's certainly
not because I hypnotize them.

02:39.166 --> 02:42.458
Hypnotizing people is wrong
and something I would never do.

02:42.541 --> 02:45.958
Gustav, be a dear
and get me something to drink.

02:46.916 --> 02:48.500
Yes, darling.

02:56.333 --> 03:00.333
Oh, Ike, isn't it wonderful?

03:00.416 --> 03:04.708
At last, we have a headquarters
for our secret organization.

03:04.791 --> 03:07.750
I feel fierce and formidable.

03:07.833 --> 03:10.500
Let's build a house
on the edge of a cliff,

03:10.583 --> 03:16.291
and let's... let's use commas
and semicolons with reckless abandon.

03:16.375 --> 03:19.791
- Let's have children.
- What's the thing Marvin Gaye said?

03:19.875 --> 03:21.458
"Let's get it on."

03:31.458 --> 03:35.208
I feel an uneasy sense of creeping dread.

03:35.291 --> 03:36.250
Of course.

03:36.333 --> 03:39.833
Everyone's sipping root beer floats,
and my brother's mooning over a girl.

03:39.916 --> 03:42.708
- She should have arrived by now.
- Beatrice can handle herself.

03:42.791 --> 03:46.166
We climbed Mount Fraught
with nothing but gum and dessert forks.

03:46.250 --> 03:47.125
She wasn't afraid.

03:47.208 --> 03:49.250
- Even when that eagle...
- Another float?

03:49.333 --> 03:50.625
It won't help. What if we're wrong?

03:50.708 --> 03:52.916
- Finish your drink.
- No group of people,

03:53.000 --> 03:54.416
no matter how noble or well-read...

03:54.500 --> 03:56.875
You never know when a root beer float...

03:56.958 --> 04:00.000
- ...can extinguish the fires of the world.
- ...can solve your problems.

04:11.458 --> 04:14.083
Have you seen a beautiful woman
dressed as a dragonfly?

04:14.166 --> 04:16.833
- She's down there.
- Beatrice!

04:19.250 --> 04:21.125
Beatrice! Count Olaf is...

04:22.708 --> 04:27.000
Alone! Desperate. Defeated.

04:27.083 --> 04:30.916
These are words I thought I'd never use
except when talking about other people.

04:32.916 --> 04:35.791
Darling! Don't you think
you ought to slow down?

04:37.291 --> 04:40.291
First the Baudelaire orphans
escaped my clutches,

04:40.375 --> 04:43.083
now one of their parents
may still be alive.

04:43.166 --> 04:46.791
Do you know what it feels like
to have your life spins out of control,

04:46.875 --> 04:51.083
as if driven by the cruel whims
of some unpredictable madman?

04:53.000 --> 04:54.750
I can't imagine that at all.

04:56.458 --> 04:58.333
Perhaps you've been lucky enough

04:58.416 --> 05:01.583
never to have been stuffed in the trunk
of a sinister villain's car.

05:01.666 --> 05:03.041
My name is Lemony Snicket,

05:03.125 --> 05:06.333
and I experienced
a terrible night at a masked ball

05:06.416 --> 05:09.416
when a secret message arrived too late
to help the woman I loved.

05:09.500 --> 05:13.041
So I know how it feels
to have your life spin out of control,

05:13.125 --> 05:16.250
driven by the cruel whims
of an unpredictable madman.

05:16.333 --> 05:17.708
Which is how the Baudelaires felt

05:17.791 --> 05:21.375
in Olaf's car as they wondered
where they were headed...

05:21.458 --> 05:22.958
Where are we headed?

05:23.041 --> 05:24.833
We are going to Caligari Carnival.

05:24.916 --> 05:28.666
...and what they would do
if Olaf decided to open the trunk.

05:28.750 --> 05:29.750
Think you've got problems?

05:29.833 --> 05:32.333
I'm never gonna find the sugar bowl
in the Hinterlands.

05:32.416 --> 05:35.625
I'm as miserable as the starving lions
we just passed.

05:36.291 --> 05:39.583
Let's hope that Madame Lulu
can turn things around,

05:39.666 --> 05:42.083
or I might just drive this car
off a cliff.

05:45.208 --> 05:47.166
Maybe wine will help us relax.

05:47.250 --> 05:50.500
- Yes, Olaf. Wine.
- Get the fruity Merlot from the trunk.

05:50.583 --> 05:53.791
Drinking and driving? Are you insane?
That's reckless.

05:55.333 --> 05:58.291
Then again, I am parched. But it can wait.

05:58.375 --> 06:02.708
If this Madame Lulu is real,
we'll hunt down the surviving Baudelaires

06:02.791 --> 06:05.791
and we'll celebrate
with all the trunk wine we want.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.958
My spirits are lifting already.

06:17.541 --> 06:19.958
We're lucky Olaf
decided not to drink and drive.

06:20.041 --> 06:22.208
And this trunk
has holes so we can breathe.

06:22.291 --> 06:25.166
We're lucky we climbed
in his car to escape the fire.

06:25.250 --> 06:27.041
And Olaf didn't cut off your head.

06:27.125 --> 06:28.791
We've been lucky so far.

06:28.875 --> 06:32.375
Soon this car will reach Calgari Carnival.
If we don't want our luck to run out,

06:32.458 --> 06:34.125
we have to figure out what to do.

06:42.750 --> 06:44.125
We've arrived.

06:48.666 --> 06:50.791
This carnival doesn't look very in.

06:50.875 --> 06:53.416
A rusty roller coaster
and a bunch of tents.

06:53.500 --> 06:54.791
Are you sure we're safe here?

06:54.875 --> 06:56.791
If the police come,
there's no place to hide.

06:56.875 --> 06:58.250
Why do we have to hide?

06:58.333 --> 06:59.750
No one comes looking for a dead man,

06:59.833 --> 07:03.916
and the Daily Punctilio
just put my obituary on the front page.

07:04.958 --> 07:07.083
"Surprisingly Low Turnout..."

07:07.166 --> 07:11.291
We have to stay long enough
for Madame Lulu to answer our questions.

07:11.375 --> 07:14.708
Where the Baudelaires are hiding.
Is one of their parents still alive?

07:14.791 --> 07:15.750
Ask about the sugar bowl.

07:15.833 --> 07:18.583
Why would we believe
some woman who lives in a tent?

07:18.666 --> 07:21.416
Not just any tent. Look.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.791
A sign that we're on the right path.
Let's go.

07:30.791 --> 07:33.458
- Could be a sign we're on the wrong...
- Not a good time.

07:38.958 --> 07:41.833
Welcome. Welcome to Caligari Carnival.

07:41.916 --> 07:44.750
Madame Lulu has been expecting you.

07:44.833 --> 07:46.458
You've been expecting us?

07:46.541 --> 07:50.541
I have vision
I receive visit from handsome stranger.

07:50.625 --> 07:52.750
- And his girlfriend?
- No, she not in vision.

07:56.666 --> 07:58.416
Coast is clear.

08:09.791 --> 08:11.666
Those must be the Mortmain Mountains.

08:12.833 --> 08:15.583
Mother and Father promised
to take us someday.

08:16.666 --> 08:19.666
What if one of our parents
did survive the fire?

08:19.750 --> 08:21.875
Olaf believes it enough
to see a fortune-teller.

08:21.958 --> 08:24.583
I've never read any evidence
that fortune-tellers are real.

08:25.833 --> 08:27.916
This might not be an ordinary one.

08:28.750 --> 08:31.791
VFD. Is that a good or bad sign?

08:31.875 --> 08:33.957
We have to find out
what she's telling him.

08:39.832 --> 08:44.000
Now, who wants fortune
from fortune-teller, please?

08:44.082 --> 08:46.458
- Me, me!
- I get to go first. I'm the oldest.

08:46.541 --> 08:48.958
- I'm older.
- I have more experience.

08:49.041 --> 08:52.000
The concept of first seems
to problematically be centered

08:52.083 --> 08:53.166
around patriarchy.

08:53.250 --> 08:55.625
There is no need for such fighting.

08:55.708 --> 08:59.708
I read fortune for all
at one reasonable group rate.

09:00.291 --> 09:04.583
You... You have experienced great loss.

09:04.666 --> 09:08.416
- True. I've lost my hair.
- Your sister, she depends upon you.

09:08.500 --> 09:09.625
How did she know?

09:09.708 --> 09:13.041
You... I don't know,
there's just a lot going on here.

09:13.125 --> 09:14.458
That's fair.

09:15.458 --> 09:17.541
Your sister, she depend upon you.

09:18.833 --> 09:19.958
My sister?

09:21.500 --> 09:23.833
- You're not real blonde.
- You can't prove that.

09:24.833 --> 09:27.458
An amusing party trick, Lulu.

09:27.541 --> 09:29.916
Any two-bit grifter
could guess those things.

09:30.000 --> 09:34.166
Tell me something that only
a real fortune-teller would know.

09:35.791 --> 09:39.625
I know you were brought here
by a series of unfortunate events.

09:48.625 --> 09:49.500
Go on.

09:49.583 --> 09:52.958
You adopted three orphans,
one of whom you tried to marry,

09:53.041 --> 09:55.666
till she literally
and figuratively escaped your grasp.

09:55.750 --> 09:57.833
You followed them
to the home of a herpetologist

09:57.916 --> 10:00.708
who you mostly fooled,
then eventually killed.

10:00.791 --> 10:02.791
- How could you...
- You visited a large lake

10:02.875 --> 10:05.416
in the off-season
where you had an ill-fated romance

10:05.500 --> 10:07.583
that ended in betrayal and leeches.

10:07.666 --> 10:10.833
You burned an old flame at an old mill,

10:10.916 --> 10:14.583
then returned to school as teacher,
where you were underpaid working nights.

10:14.666 --> 10:17.250
- Egad!
- You meet a partner in a penthouse,

10:17.333 --> 10:21.041
and you murder an old enemy
in a murder of crows.

10:21.125 --> 10:25.333
A good man. A noble man.

10:25.416 --> 10:28.833
His words, they haunt you
from beyond the grave,

10:28.916 --> 10:32.208
and even hospital visit
doesn't make you feel better.

10:32.291 --> 10:36.833
You have set fire after fire,
but it's never enough,

10:36.916 --> 10:43.750
for time flies like a poison dart
and the force of destiny cages us all.

10:48.083 --> 10:49.416
Wow!

10:56.208 --> 11:00.125
I can see you live up to your reputation.
We should've come sooner.

11:00.208 --> 11:03.250
Is only small taste of
Madame Lulu's power.

11:03.333 --> 11:05.125
I can see that you are a man

11:05.208 --> 11:07.875
with big questions.

11:07.958 --> 11:13.500
And for big answers,
you need to be asking of the crystal ball.

11:15.250 --> 11:19.166
I always thought crystal balls
were as fake as those eyelashes.

11:19.250 --> 11:24.083
No, no, no. They are as real as the jewels
on your teeny-tiny engagement ring.

11:24.166 --> 11:25.625
How does it work?

11:25.708 --> 11:28.083
Oh, is very complicated to explain,
please.

11:28.166 --> 11:30.166
- Try me.
- Okay.

11:31.708 --> 11:37.250
Once a day, when spirits call,
you may ask one question of the ball

11:37.333 --> 11:43.291
and then spirits come in smoke and fire
to answer you

11:43.375 --> 11:45.208
your heart's desire.

11:45.291 --> 11:46.625
That seems plausible.

11:46.708 --> 11:49.500
It does not! It seems totally believable.

11:49.583 --> 11:51.083
Tell me, my Olaf.

11:51.166 --> 11:53.875
What is your heart's desire?

11:55.625 --> 11:58.458
- Ask where we can find the Baudelaires.
- Ask about the sugar bowl.

11:58.541 --> 12:02.625
Well, that's easy.
Lend me your ear, Madame Lulu.

12:02.708 --> 12:05.458
Ooh. Is just hoop earring, but okay.

12:05.541 --> 12:09.916
Did one of the Baudelaire parents
survive the fire?

12:17.083 --> 12:18.833
You will have your answer in morning.

12:18.916 --> 12:20.500
Argh!

12:20.583 --> 12:21.416
The morning?

12:21.500 --> 12:25.458
Is how crystal ball works.
Day shift, night shift, like a cannery.

12:25.541 --> 12:26.958
What do we do tonight?

12:27.041 --> 12:31.166
We toast. To getting answers
to all of our questions.

12:31.250 --> 12:33.625
At a reasonable group rate.

12:33.708 --> 12:35.333
Oh.

12:35.416 --> 12:37.041
Break out the trunk wine!

12:39.791 --> 12:42.208
What should I do?

12:42.291 --> 12:45.416
Should I call her?
What if my stepdad picks up?

12:54.291 --> 12:57.125
I wonder if he's still mad at me.

13:01.958 --> 13:04.500
It's uncanny.
Madame Lulu knows everything about us.

13:04.583 --> 13:06.041
Not from that crystal ball.

13:06.125 --> 13:09.000
Fortune-telling may not be real,
but she got her information somewhere.

13:09.083 --> 13:11.000
She may know
if one of our parents survived.

13:11.083 --> 13:13.625
We can't wait until morning, Sunny.

13:13.708 --> 13:15.750
Olaf could spot us any second.

13:15.833 --> 13:18.291
Plus, there's a pack of hungry lions.

13:19.666 --> 13:21.666
The carnival is hiring
for its House of Freaks.

13:21.750 --> 13:25.041
If we got jobs, we'd be able
to find out what Lulu knows and how.

13:25.125 --> 13:26.791
We don't look like carnival freaks.

13:28.083 --> 13:29.041
I have an idea.

13:36.625 --> 13:37.875
I see face paint.

13:37.958 --> 13:39.708
And clothing that's too big for us.

13:48.083 --> 13:51.333
I thought by now
I'd have all the trunk wine I wanted.

13:52.291 --> 13:55.125
You know, Mama told me I'd be a star.

13:55.208 --> 13:57.416
- You never talk about your mother.
- She wasn't my mother.

13:57.500 --> 13:59.708
That's the woman who owned the houseboat.

13:59.791 --> 14:03.375
We agreed that by age 28,

14:03.458 --> 14:06.291
I would live in a castle made of success,

14:07.541 --> 14:11.375
just reading my own glowing
theatrical reviews

14:11.458 --> 14:13.791
in a bed full of money.

14:13.875 --> 14:16.541
You know, happy.

14:16.625 --> 14:20.458
- This is fascinating story, my Olaf.
- Your Olaf?

14:20.541 --> 14:22.875
But is bedtime, please.

14:22.958 --> 14:28.625
Crystal ball needs rest before giving you
big magic spirit answer in morning.

14:30.208 --> 14:32.333
What's in that big, mysterious armoire?

14:32.416 --> 14:34.583
Stay away from Caligari Cabinet, please.

14:37.625 --> 14:38.666
Did you hear something?

14:44.541 --> 14:46.500
Who could that be at this hour?

14:46.583 --> 14:48.666
Hmm. Is probably pack of starving lions.

14:48.750 --> 14:52.541
Come out, come out, whatever you are.

14:55.666 --> 14:57.083
You...

15:06.750 --> 15:08.250
Who, please, are you?

15:08.333 --> 15:11.583
We're three... two freaks.

15:11.666 --> 15:13.291
We saw your ad. We're looking for work.

15:13.375 --> 15:16.208
You certainly are hideous
with those two heads.

15:16.291 --> 15:18.916
Too late for interview.
Come back in morning.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.958
Nonsense!
Auditioning is one of my specialties.

15:22.750 --> 15:26.583
Lulu, let me tease... No, torment... Mmm.

15:26.666 --> 15:29.750
Interview these freaks
for your carnival show.

15:29.833 --> 15:31.000
This way.

15:47.916 --> 15:50.583
Besides getting
several paper cuts in the same day

15:50.666 --> 15:53.666
or receiving news your worst enemy
has been awarded free ice cream,

15:53.750 --> 15:57.583
one of the most unpleasant experiences
in life is a job interview.

15:57.666 --> 16:00.250
- What did you say your names were?
- Uh, we didn't.

16:00.333 --> 16:02.541
From the moment
you introduce yourself...

16:02.625 --> 16:04.416
I'm Beverly.
This is my other head, Elliot.

16:04.500 --> 16:05.916
...you're participating
in a ritual

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
you are likely to find humiliating
and sinister.

16:10.791 --> 16:13.625
Must be difficult, having two heads.

16:13.708 --> 16:16.833
It's very difficult. You can't imagine
how hard it is to find clothes.

16:16.916 --> 16:17.916
I noticed your shirt.

16:18.000 --> 16:21.750
I've got one just like it,
not as dirty obviously. It's very in.

16:21.833 --> 16:24.208
We care about fashion.

16:24.291 --> 16:27.416
- Aw.
- Do you have trouble eating?

16:27.500 --> 16:28.708
Yeah.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.416
You may be asked to perform
some meaningless task

16:32.500 --> 16:33.750
you're in no position to refuse.

16:33.833 --> 16:34.666
Well, I...

16:34.750 --> 16:36.541
- Let's see how much trouble you have.
- Oh.

16:36.625 --> 16:41.291
Here, eat this ear of corn,
you two-headed freak.

16:47.208 --> 16:51.416
You are likely to be watched carefully,
and you will likely pretend to be

16:51.500 --> 16:54.416
far more enthusiastic
than you actually are.

16:54.500 --> 16:57.125
- Look at them!
- They can't even eat an ear of corn!

16:57.208 --> 16:58.166
How freakish!

16:58.250 --> 17:00.000
And you are likely
to be evaluated,

17:00.083 --> 17:02.458
which here means tested over and over

17:02.541 --> 17:04.750
for no reason other than
your own embarrassment.

17:07.625 --> 17:10.290
Pick the corn up off the table, freak.

17:10.375 --> 17:12.375
The worst thing
about a job interview

17:12.458 --> 17:15.125
is that it is likely to fill you
with despair,

17:15.208 --> 17:16.583
whether you are dismissed immediately

17:16.665 --> 17:19.290
and find yourself wandering unemployed

17:19.375 --> 17:22.208
across a desolate landscape,
weeping and moaning,

17:22.290 --> 17:23.333
or whether you are hired,

17:23.415 --> 17:26.250
and find yourself wandering across
that same desolate landscape,

17:26.333 --> 17:29.458
weeping and moaning
in exchange for a salary.

17:32.250 --> 17:35.125
That is the funniest job interview
I have ever seen!

17:35.208 --> 17:37.666
You must hire these freaks at once, Lulu.

17:37.750 --> 17:40.958
Audiences love sloppy eating.
Trust me, I know.

17:41.041 --> 17:43.500
What is that?

17:43.583 --> 17:47.458
Oh, some sort of feral infant.

17:48.291 --> 17:49.541
Ahhh!

17:49.625 --> 17:51.750
That is Chabo the Wolf Baby.

17:51.833 --> 17:53.958
Her mother, a hunter,
fell in love with a wolf.

17:54.041 --> 17:55.125
That's their child.

17:55.208 --> 17:56.458
I didn't know that was possible.

17:56.541 --> 17:59.750
Ooh, it might be funny
to watch her eat corn, too.

18:00.916 --> 18:01.958
Here, Chabo!

18:02.041 --> 18:04.875
Ahhh!

18:07.708 --> 18:08.583
She's a bit wild.

18:09.750 --> 18:13.583
People are always liking of the violence.
Yes, Chabo is hired, too.

18:13.666 --> 18:17.125
Starting at show tomorrow,
Beverly and Elliot will eat corn

18:17.208 --> 18:19.625
and little wolf freak
will attack audience.

18:19.708 --> 18:21.083
Questions?

18:21.166 --> 18:24.125
Of course they don't.
They're lucky to have work.

18:24.208 --> 18:26.916
Without this carnival,
they'd be working in human resources

18:27.000 --> 18:28.208
with the rest of the freaks.

18:28.291 --> 18:31.708
You are as right
as you are handsome, my Olaf.

18:31.791 --> 18:35.083
- Handsome?
- Is business term, please.

18:35.166 --> 18:37.583
Wolfie, two-headed thing,
report to House of Freaks,

18:37.666 --> 18:39.666
where work accommodations
will be provided.

18:39.750 --> 18:43.208
Also health insurance,
although nearby hospital is how you say...

18:43.291 --> 18:45.666
- Burned down.
- Out of network.

18:45.750 --> 18:46.750
Off you go.

18:49.666 --> 18:52.625
Unless you're still hungry.
There's plenty of corn.

18:54.125 --> 18:58.708
We'll eat them like normal people,
but you freaks just aren't like us.

18:58.791 --> 19:03.791
Not like us! Not like us!
Not like us! Not like us!

19:03.875 --> 19:06.750
- Not like us! Not like us!
- One of us! One of us!

19:06.833 --> 19:09.708
One of us! One of us! One of us!

19:09.791 --> 19:11.583
Don't shout, Hugo. We can see them.

19:11.666 --> 19:12.833
I'm just excited.

19:12.916 --> 19:15.250
It's not every day we get new colleagues.

19:15.333 --> 19:16.458
We got a new Madame Lulu.

19:16.541 --> 19:19.458
Quiet.
You're disrupting my meditation exercise.

19:19.541 --> 19:23.333
I was visualizing a world
where there was nothing wrong with me.

19:23.416 --> 19:25.833
Unlike this world,
where I'm a hideous freak.

19:26.791 --> 19:29.833
- Popcorn?
- We don't like corn anymore.

19:29.916 --> 19:31.291
Not surprised you have no appetite.

19:31.375 --> 19:32.791
You have it almost as bad as I do.

19:32.875 --> 19:34.625
I'm used to people staring.

19:34.708 --> 19:36.750
Because of your pleasant facial features?

19:36.833 --> 19:38.416
And your symmetrical jawline?

19:38.500 --> 19:40.166
It's nice you pretend not to notice.

19:41.375 --> 19:44.000
The popcorn? I'm holding it
in two equally strong hands.

19:44.083 --> 19:46.833
Go ahead. Say it. "Look at Kevin,
the ambidextrous freak."

19:46.916 --> 19:47.791
Ambidextrous?

19:47.875 --> 19:50.000
Isn't that both right-and left-handed?

19:50.083 --> 19:51.125
You have heard of me.

19:51.208 --> 19:53.041
That why you traveled to the Hinterlands?

19:53.125 --> 19:56.375
So you can stare at someone who can write
his name with either hand?

19:56.458 --> 19:58.250
I just know what ambidextrous means.

19:58.333 --> 20:01.666
I had a feeling you'd be smart.
You have twice as many brains.

20:01.750 --> 20:03.208
It's better than being a hunchback.

20:03.291 --> 20:05.125
Your heads and hands might be freaky,

20:05.208 --> 20:07.833
but at least you have
absolutely normal shoulders.

20:09.458 --> 20:11.750
What good are normal shoulders
attached to hands

20:11.833 --> 20:14.041
that are equally good
at using a knife and a fork?

20:14.125 --> 20:16.875
Oh, Kevin, I know it's depressing
to be so freakish,

20:16.958 --> 20:19.375
but at least you're better off than I am.

20:19.833 --> 20:23.250
My name is Colette. If you're going
to laugh, get it over with.

20:23.333 --> 20:25.291
I don't blame you for laughing
at a contortionist.

20:25.375 --> 20:27.416
- Contortionist?
- I can bend my body

20:27.500 --> 20:29.541
into all sorts of unusual positions.

20:32.250 --> 20:34.750
You see? I'm a complete freak.

20:36.041 --> 20:39.166
I think that's amazing.
So does Sunny. I mean Chabo.

20:39.250 --> 20:42.833
That's polite of you.
But I'm ashamed to be a contortionist.

20:42.916 --> 20:45.958
Why don't you move your body normally
instead of doing contortions?

20:46.041 --> 20:48.583
Because I'm in the House of Freaks.

20:48.666 --> 20:50.958
Nobody would pay to see me move normally.

20:51.041 --> 20:52.625
It's a dilemma. At tomorrow's show,

20:52.708 --> 20:56.791
crowds will be waiting for Colette
to twist into strange positions,

20:56.875 --> 20:58.708
for Kevin to write his name
with both hands,

20:58.791 --> 21:00.916
and for me to try on one of these coats.

21:01.000 --> 21:04.958
Well, you don't have to do that.
None of you have to do any of that.

21:05.041 --> 21:06.291
You sound like the old Madame Lulu.

21:06.375 --> 21:08.583
She was encouraging us
to apply to community college.

21:08.666 --> 21:10.250
Even offered to pay our tuition.

21:10.333 --> 21:12.000
But the world would see us as freaks.

21:12.083 --> 21:13.833
What other jobs could we have?

21:13.916 --> 21:16.541
I'll go pop this popcorn
for the concession stand.

21:16.625 --> 21:19.125
I need to twist these pipe cleaners
into finger puppets

21:19.208 --> 21:20.541
to sell in the gift caravan.

21:20.625 --> 21:23.416
I'd better get back to overseeing
marketing and brand management.

21:23.500 --> 21:25.041
If you don't mind pitching in,

21:25.125 --> 21:27.458
you could pick sequins
out of that laundry.

21:27.541 --> 21:28.791
They get everywhere.

21:29.750 --> 21:34.333
Oh, it's a tough world out there.
We freaks have to stick together.

21:35.583 --> 21:38.541
Nobody deserves
to be ridiculed, on stage or off.

21:38.625 --> 21:40.958
I feel bad
that we have to lie to them.

21:41.041 --> 21:42.916
It's the only way to get answers
from Lulu.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.541
If we can trust her.

21:44.625 --> 21:46.291
Did you notice something strange
about her?

21:46.375 --> 21:47.791
Everything is strange about her.

21:47.875 --> 21:50.291
I feel like we've seen her before.

21:51.750 --> 21:53.208
Good night, my Olaf!

21:54.750 --> 21:56.208
My Olaf.

21:56.750 --> 21:59.458
Does not matter.
Have wonderful sleepings,

21:59.541 --> 22:02.083
and in the morning
you'll have big important answer

22:02.166 --> 22:04.625
to your big important question.

22:04.708 --> 22:05.750
Good night.

22:05.833 --> 22:08.000
- I'm fine. I can walk.
- You can't.

22:08.083 --> 22:10.291
- Look. Look.
- Darling, you can't walk.

22:19.208 --> 22:20.666
It's me.

22:20.750 --> 22:23.416
It's me.
We have a complication.

22:23.500 --> 22:24.625
No.

22:24.708 --> 22:26.291
No. Oh, no.

22:26.375 --> 22:28.500
It's way worse than that.

22:28.583 --> 22:31.166
What do you know
about the survivor of the fire?

22:35.708 --> 22:37.208
I don't trust that Madame Lulu.

22:37.291 --> 22:39.833
She's a witchy woman in the Hinterlands
who runs a carnival.

22:39.916 --> 22:40.750
What's not to trust?

22:40.833 --> 22:43.583
- Her accent sounds fake.
- Your accent sounds fake.

22:43.666 --> 22:46.125
If she's so good at fortune-telling,
why does she live here

22:46.208 --> 22:47.958
instead of having her own show
in the city?

22:48.041 --> 22:50.333
I tried that for nine years.
Look where it got me.

22:50.416 --> 22:53.041
- I don't like how she looks at you.
- Darling.

22:53.958 --> 22:55.250
When I was on stage,

22:55.333 --> 22:58.750
or occasionally in several
minimum security penitentiaries,

22:58.833 --> 23:01.375
strange women would offer me things
all the time.

23:01.458 --> 23:05.375
Flowers, tasteful photographs,
marriage proposals.

23:05.458 --> 23:06.875
Some were wealthy.

23:06.958 --> 23:10.291
Rich dowagers enchanted
by my roguish charm

23:10.375 --> 23:12.458
with no head for estate planning.

23:12.541 --> 23:13.541
And did I accept?

23:15.458 --> 23:19.541
That's not the point.
You saw what that fortune-teller can do.

23:19.625 --> 23:23.750
She can tell us everything we need.
All we have to do is butter her up.

23:23.833 --> 23:26.500
You know...
like an ear of corn.

23:26.583 --> 23:28.916
We'll stay a few days.
Put the troupe to work.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.625
And then, when she's buttered...

23:34.541 --> 23:36.041
One squirt or two?

23:37.125 --> 23:38.125
I'll come with you.

23:38.208 --> 23:41.208
No, no, no.
You stay here and finish your portrait.

23:41.291 --> 23:43.333
Darling?

23:45.541 --> 23:46.708
Darling!

23:50.250 --> 23:51.625
Got the nose all wrong.

24:04.291 --> 24:07.375
Like baby goat,
we begin in darkness.

24:11.833 --> 24:14.666
I'm glad we're all alone, Lulu.

24:14.750 --> 24:18.791
I have so many very big questions.

24:18.875 --> 24:22.416
If you could convince the spirits
to knock out a few in a row,

24:22.500 --> 24:26.000
I'd be inclined to give you
a special reward.

24:27.500 --> 24:31.166
First we discuss
matter of payment.

24:31.250 --> 24:32.833
Payment? Like money?

24:32.916 --> 24:36.000
Caligari Carnival is on hard times.

24:36.083 --> 24:39.833
Madame Lulu is thinking brand-new show

24:39.916 --> 24:43.166
starring very famous actor...

24:43.250 --> 24:45.875
- I'll do it.
- Ah, very good.

24:45.958 --> 24:51.208
Now we call upon the spirits.

24:55.125 --> 24:57.208
Spirits!

24:58.666 --> 25:00.250
I'm not...

25:01.083 --> 25:02.333
Did you feel a chill?

25:02.416 --> 25:04.625
It's spirits arriving.

25:05.250 --> 25:08.541
- Whose spirits are they?
- Ghosts from your past.

25:08.625 --> 25:10.916
Does this make you nervous?

25:11.000 --> 25:13.958
Who, me?
I have no secrets and nothing to hide.

25:14.041 --> 25:15.458
Good.

25:16.291 --> 25:21.166
Magic is very fragile thing,
like dragonfly.

25:21.250 --> 25:25.541
Or woman in dragonfly costume.

25:32.541 --> 25:35.791
- How did you know?
- Spirits know everything.

25:35.875 --> 25:40.000
You come to Madame Lulu
to ask about survivor of Baudelaire fire,

25:40.083 --> 25:44.250
and Madame Lulu has your answer.

25:49.750 --> 25:53.458
No!

25:53.541 --> 25:56.333
Five minutes!
Five minutes till show time!

25:56.416 --> 25:58.291
One of us! One of us!

25:58.375 --> 26:01.666
Welcome to the House of Freaks.
Do you juggle or...

26:01.750 --> 26:03.666
I'm a normal person with hooks for hands.

26:03.750 --> 26:07.291
I envy you. Which hook do you favor?
Would you care for some muesli?

26:07.375 --> 26:09.208
- I can't eat muesli.
- Don't be silly.

26:09.291 --> 26:10.958
We could use a welding gun
to attach a spoon...

26:11.041 --> 26:13.708
I can't, because I'm running around
following orders.

26:13.791 --> 26:17.041
You freaks better put on a fantastic show,
because the boss is in a bad mood.

26:17.125 --> 26:18.291
Madame Lulu told him

26:18.375 --> 26:21.125
one of those Baudelaire parents is alive!

26:21.708 --> 26:23.500
It's a miracle!

26:25.166 --> 26:27.125
Miracles are like meatballs.

26:27.208 --> 26:28.916
Nobody can agree what they're made of,

26:29.000 --> 26:32.166
where they come from,
or how often they should appear.

26:32.250 --> 26:33.916
- Humph.
- What did you say?

26:34.000 --> 26:36.250
"Humph," an expression of mild disgust.

26:36.333 --> 26:38.375
- About the Baudelaires.
- What do you care?

26:38.458 --> 26:42.500
We've been reading about them.
We're very interested in those children.

26:42.583 --> 26:44.041
Who are obviously innocent.

26:46.166 --> 26:48.125
A person might say a sunrise is a miracle,

26:48.208 --> 26:51.375
though it happens every day
and too early in the morning.

26:51.458 --> 26:52.916
Those parents are supposed to be dead,

26:53.000 --> 26:56.500
but Madame Lulu looked in her crystal ball
and saw one of them survived.

26:56.583 --> 27:00.000
Somebody else might say that leaping
successfully from a train is a miracle,

27:00.083 --> 27:03.291
though that happens every day
and too early in the morning.

27:03.375 --> 27:04.958
There's a survivor? Where?

27:05.041 --> 27:06.041
The ball wouldn't say.

27:06.125 --> 27:08.125
Madame Lulu said we'd have to wait
until morning

27:08.208 --> 27:09.416
because it's a different question.

27:09.500 --> 27:11.833
I wouldn't bring that up.
It's a sore spot.

27:11.916 --> 27:13.375
Did he tell you how it worked?

27:13.458 --> 27:14.833
He said the tent got cold,

27:14.916 --> 27:18.375
filled with smoke and fire,
and he saw a ghost from the past.

27:18.458 --> 27:20.291
You know, magic.

27:21.833 --> 27:24.333
- We have no idea if it's true.
- If it is?

27:25.541 --> 27:28.166
Then we have to know
how Lulu gets her information.

27:28.250 --> 27:29.708
We have to sneak into her tent.

27:29.791 --> 27:32.625
Another similarity
shared by a miracle and a meatball:

27:32.708 --> 27:36.333
They both might appear to be one thing
and turn out to be another.

27:36.416 --> 27:39.333
This could happen
at a gathering of a secret society,

27:39.416 --> 27:42.375
particularly if it's held
at a second-rate Italian restaurant.

27:42.458 --> 27:45.500
It happened to the Baudelaires
when they were hoping

27:45.583 --> 27:47.875
to find a miracle in Madame Lulu's tent.

27:47.958 --> 27:50.458
You freaks ready for the big show?

27:50.541 --> 27:53.083
Instead, they found something far worse.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.333
Buy some popcorn!

28:00.416 --> 28:02.875
It hasn't been sitting out
since last night!

28:02.958 --> 28:04.416
Soda! Healthy soda!

28:04.500 --> 28:07.916
I'm selling this precooked hot dog
I found on the ground.

28:09.625 --> 28:13.166
If one of our parents
really did survive, where are they?

28:13.250 --> 28:15.250
Why aren't they trying to find us?

28:15.333 --> 28:17.875
Maybe they've been
searching everywhere

28:17.958 --> 28:20.416
but can't find us 'cause we keep moving.

28:20.500 --> 28:23.791
We should stay put
and figure out as much as we can.

28:23.875 --> 28:25.125
Without getting recognized.

28:27.041 --> 28:29.291
You freaks better put on a good show.

28:29.375 --> 28:33.125
My boyfriend told me if you don't,
I can hit you with my tagliatelle grande.

28:33.208 --> 28:34.625
What's a tagliatelle grande?

28:34.708 --> 28:37.166
Tagliatelle
is an Italian noodle.

28:37.250 --> 28:39.125
And grande is Italian for big.

28:39.208 --> 28:40.750
That's right, though nobody asked you.

28:40.833 --> 28:44.500
This is a big noodle
I had the troupe whip up to use as a whip.

28:44.583 --> 28:45.833
Italian food is in,

28:45.916 --> 28:49.416
but getting whipped with it
is often damp and uncomfortable.

28:51.666 --> 28:53.208
How's the noodle working?

28:53.291 --> 28:56.333
- Delicious. How's the crowd?
- Uh, well, it's, um...

28:56.416 --> 28:57.583
It's a matinee.

28:57.666 --> 29:01.541
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
adolescents of every gender!

29:01.625 --> 29:03.500
Buy your reasonably-priced
concessions now,

29:03.583 --> 29:07.291
because the House of Freaks show
is about to begin!

29:07.375 --> 29:08.666
Look at those freaks!

29:08.750 --> 29:10.583
A man with hooks instead of hands!

29:10.666 --> 29:12.958
I'm not a freak. I'm playing the calliope.

29:47.625 --> 29:48.583
Look at him.

29:48.666 --> 29:51.750
The hunch is caused
by a spinal abnormality.

29:51.833 --> 29:53.708
Spines!

29:53.791 --> 29:55.750
Get dressed, Hugo!

29:57.333 --> 29:58.666
Isn't it hilarious?

29:58.750 --> 30:00.791
He can't put on a coat.

30:00.875 --> 30:02.208
Can someone help him?

30:20.583 --> 30:22.000
She looks normal.

30:22.083 --> 30:25.000
Only to the untrained eye.
If by "untrained" we mean,

30:25.083 --> 30:28.458
"never having seen this person
do these particular things."

30:28.541 --> 30:30.416
- Wow. That's actually...
- Look at her.

30:31.125 --> 30:33.250
Imagine being next to that at yoga.

30:33.333 --> 30:34.791
How humiliating.

30:34.875 --> 30:35.958
For her.

30:57.500 --> 30:58.416
Is he...

30:58.500 --> 31:00.000
He's ambivalent.

31:00.083 --> 31:01.791
- What?
- Ambiguous.

31:01.875 --> 31:04.958
- "Ambidextrous."
- Ambidextrous!

31:05.041 --> 31:06.625
Write your name, Kenneth.

31:06.708 --> 31:08.458
- It's Kevin.
- Yep.

31:09.500 --> 31:13.666
Ladies and gentlemen,
his signatures are basically identical.

31:13.750 --> 31:16.958
I've never seen two things
as identical as that.

31:17.041 --> 31:18.666
That is freakish. Right?

31:19.333 --> 31:20.916
Now, avert your eyes,

31:21.000 --> 31:25.666
unless you're brave enough to handle
the sight of a man shaving with two hands.

31:28.291 --> 31:32.625
I apologize if this is too shocking
for any of the children in the crowd.

31:36.666 --> 31:37.708
Oh!

31:39.541 --> 31:41.166
That was humiliating,

31:41.250 --> 31:43.208
- so I guess it went well.
- Yup.

31:43.916 --> 31:45.250
That means we're next.

31:46.250 --> 31:48.500
You are going to love our next act.

31:48.583 --> 31:52.208
But first, how about a hand
for our ringmaster?

32:22.958 --> 32:25.458
You heard my boyfriend.
Get out there!

32:25.541 --> 32:28.125
Unless you want pasta scars.

32:39.041 --> 32:43.583
Behold. Corn!
Something every normal person can eat.

32:43.666 --> 32:45.583
Can you eat corn, normal person?

32:45.666 --> 32:47.041
I prefer asparagus.

32:48.541 --> 32:49.958
I mean delicious corn.

32:50.041 --> 32:55.041
These brand-new freaks will turn
these ears of corn into a hideous mess,

32:55.125 --> 32:58.458
while one of them more or less growls.

32:58.541 --> 33:01.333
Please laugh, make tasteless jokes

33:01.416 --> 33:04.083
and purchase beverages
to throw at the heads

33:04.166 --> 33:09.166
of Beverly and Elliot
and Chabo the Wolf Baby!

33:09.250 --> 33:12.666
- Come on, I wanna see corn eaten badly.
- Yeah.

33:21.708 --> 33:23.500
Eat the damn corn.

33:28.583 --> 33:30.291
No one needed to witness

33:30.375 --> 33:33.541
the horrible and humiliating scene
that followed.

34:08.875 --> 34:11.333
- That was horrible.
- Humiliating.

34:11.416 --> 34:14.708
People think it's funny when someone
drops corn. They should drop it.

34:14.791 --> 34:18.833
Every moment we're being laughed at,
we could be finding out what Lulu knows.

34:20.125 --> 34:24.041
- We have to get to that tent.
- That was horrible. That was humiliating.

34:24.666 --> 34:27.500
It's bad enough
I have to kill time in a carnival

34:27.583 --> 34:30.083
waiting for mystical spirits
to solve my problems.

34:30.166 --> 34:31.333
But I make the best of it.

34:31.416 --> 34:36.166
I give one of my greatest performances,
and there's hardly anyone in the audience.

34:36.250 --> 34:37.375
There were three people.

34:38.416 --> 34:41.583
I tell you Caligari Carnival
is on hard times.

34:41.666 --> 34:45.333
Is not good business model
to have carnival in Hinterlands.

34:45.416 --> 34:48.625
The roller coaster is on the...
What's the word, fritz.

34:48.708 --> 34:53.583
And frankly, roving pack of starving lions
really cuts down on tourist trade.

34:53.666 --> 34:56.916
I didn't give up
a glamorous theatrical career

34:57.000 --> 34:59.375
to be performing to nearly-empty houses.

34:59.458 --> 35:00.916
You gave it up to chase those orphans.

35:01.000 --> 35:04.208
They're not orphans
if one parent is still alive!

35:04.291 --> 35:10.750
Spirit world will be answering
all your questions very soon, please.

35:10.833 --> 35:13.541
My Olaf must have patience.

35:13.625 --> 35:15.500
I'm tired of patience.

35:16.666 --> 35:20.833
If you want a mule to move,
you can reward it with a carrot

35:20.916 --> 35:22.875
or you can hit it with a stick.

35:24.041 --> 35:25.875
I want answers to my questions,

35:25.958 --> 35:28.833
and I want an audience
worthy of my greatness.

35:28.916 --> 35:32.791
I need to find a way to fill the stands
with adoring crowds,

35:32.875 --> 35:38.541
and yet remind certain people
that I am a force to be feared and obeyed.

35:39.541 --> 35:41.458
But what could possibly do that?

35:49.166 --> 35:52.708
Maybe I can beat two mules with one stick.

35:53.708 --> 35:55.375
I need to run an errand.

35:55.458 --> 35:57.500
I need all of you to dig a pit.

35:57.583 --> 35:59.250
My Olaf is leaving?

35:59.333 --> 36:01.291
Yes. To get you a gift.

36:01.375 --> 36:04.000
- What kind of gift?
- Not any of my bracelets.

36:06.958 --> 36:09.333
- It's a surprise.
- Mmm.

36:11.416 --> 36:12.791
I need to borrow this.

36:13.791 --> 36:15.833
What are you freaks looking at?

36:15.916 --> 36:19.458
We're wondering if you had
any notes on our performance.

36:20.916 --> 36:22.541
One of your heads was good.

36:33.041 --> 36:35.208
- What do you think he's planning?
- Nothing good.

36:35.291 --> 36:37.500
But it gives us an opportunity. Come on.

36:45.916 --> 36:48.333
Come with me.
Tell me what you think of my dress.

37:05.166 --> 37:06.583
We don't have much time.

37:06.666 --> 37:09.416
Esmé won't be able
to keep Madame Lulu distracted forever.

37:09.500 --> 37:11.875
Olaf said the tent got cold,
filled with smoke,

37:11.958 --> 37:13.000
then he saw ghosts.

37:13.083 --> 37:15.291
- How do you explain that?
- Not with magic.

37:15.375 --> 37:18.291
Maybe the ribbon Sunny gave me
will help me think.

37:28.208 --> 37:31.791
The cooling air could be carbon dioxide
converting to gas in a dry ice machine.

37:31.875 --> 37:34.125
That would explain the temperature change
and smoke.

37:36.375 --> 37:39.416
I've heard of illusions
using the projector and a prismatic lens.

37:39.500 --> 37:41.000
If the crystal ball is the lens...

37:41.083 --> 37:43.625
- The projector must be underneath.
- Exactly.

37:46.041 --> 37:48.083
The images come through
to look like spirits.

37:48.166 --> 37:51.541
Lulu's using technology
to make people believe it's magic.

37:51.625 --> 37:54.666
She told Olaf all about us.
How'd she know all that?

37:55.416 --> 37:57.166
The Daily Punctilio.

37:59.875 --> 38:04.083
Then she's a fraud, and she doesn't
know if one of our parents is alive.

38:05.041 --> 38:06.958
I'm sorry, Klaus.

38:08.708 --> 38:10.541
I wanted a miracle, too.

38:11.958 --> 38:13.208
It can't all be fake.

38:13.291 --> 38:16.666
There has to be something here
that isn't just... just smoke and mirrors.

38:20.458 --> 38:22.791
In the words of a very wise...

38:22.875 --> 38:24.083
Uncle Monty.

38:24.166 --> 38:28.750
- ...life is a conundrum of esoterica.
- Of esoterica.

38:28.833 --> 38:30.458
- I miss him.
- Me, too.

38:35.791 --> 38:37.791
Aunt Josephine, dancing.

38:37.875 --> 38:39.250
She looks so happy.

38:39.333 --> 38:40.583
And brave.

38:42.000 --> 38:43.708
Let's dance.

38:43.791 --> 38:46.541
Oh, excuse me.
I can't see without my glasses.

38:46.625 --> 38:49.166
- Dr. Orwell.
- Well, she's gone now, too.

38:49.250 --> 38:50.750
So many people in this film are dead.

38:50.833 --> 38:52.416
It's like watching ghosts from the past.

38:52.500 --> 38:55.875
- Why does Lulu have this?
- Because they're all connected.

38:55.958 --> 38:58.125
VFD has something to do
with Jacques Snicket,

38:58.208 --> 38:59.791
our parents, our guardians.

38:59.875 --> 39:01.500
And Olaf and the Quagmires.

39:01.583 --> 39:04.291
- And us.
- And Madame Lulu.

39:04.375 --> 39:06.541
Maybe she does know about our parents.

39:08.666 --> 39:10.458
We haven't searched that cabinet yet.

39:17.083 --> 39:20.791
- It's like a secret library.
- Those disguises look like Olaf's.

39:20.875 --> 39:25.125
- They can't be. His are in his car.
- They're just part of the same kit.

39:25.208 --> 39:28.291
- It says, "Various fakery disguises."
- More VFD.

39:28.958 --> 39:30.208
More films.

39:40.833 --> 39:42.500
That's the movie we watched with Monty.

39:44.458 --> 39:47.666
What I want people to take away
from my films are the themes,

39:47.750 --> 39:51.083
the characters
and the secret messages in the subtitles.

39:51.166 --> 39:53.250
For example, my character might say,

39:53.333 --> 39:57.458
"Deborah, please return my end table."

39:57.541 --> 40:01.958
But look through the spy glass,
and you see the word "Department."

40:02.041 --> 40:04.875
When meeting a volunteer,
you may determine their allegiance

40:04.958 --> 40:06.875
- with the use of a code phrase.
- Jacques Snicket.

40:06.958 --> 40:08.250
"The world is quiet here."

40:08.333 --> 40:09.916
That was in Duncan's commonplace book.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.708
With the loss of our best lion tamer
and her husband,

40:12.791 --> 40:15.791
the Volunteer Feline Detectives
have escaped into the Hinterlands.

40:15.875 --> 40:16.791
Jacquelyn?

40:16.875 --> 40:18.666
"Young lady,
have you been good to your mother?"

40:18.750 --> 40:22.000
Now, that code means
run away, your house is on fire.

40:22.083 --> 40:23.125
Larry, our waiter.

40:23.208 --> 40:24.708
Secretary disguise.

40:24.791 --> 40:26.625
Boat Captain disguise.

40:28.708 --> 40:29.708
Bride disguise.

40:29.791 --> 40:31.291
Detective disguise.

40:31.375 --> 40:32.875
Arsonist disguise.

40:33.958 --> 40:35.041
It is the disguise kit.

40:38.500 --> 40:41.375
These files contain a report
on the tragic events...

40:41.458 --> 40:43.291
- Who's that?
- He looks like Jacques.

40:43.375 --> 40:46.625
At Stain'd-by-the-sea,
which had to wait until now to be told

40:46.708 --> 40:50.041
due to respect for the surviving parties
and copyright law.

40:53.333 --> 40:56.958
Let's get a smile from the newlyweds.
Both sets of you. Ready?

40:57.041 --> 40:58.458
Three, two, one...

40:58.541 --> 40:59.708
Gorgonzola!

41:00.750 --> 41:02.500
- Our parents.
- Our guardians.

41:02.583 --> 41:04.041
They were part of the same organization.

41:04.125 --> 41:05.750
- A secret organization...
- That uses codes.

41:05.833 --> 41:07.416
- And disguises.
- And put out fires.

41:07.500 --> 41:10.083
There's a name for a volunteer
organization that puts out fires.

41:10.166 --> 41:11.041
Volunteer.

41:11.125 --> 41:12.291
- Fire.
- Department.

41:12.375 --> 41:13.666
- Volunteer.
- Fire.

41:14.833 --> 41:15.916
VFD.

41:17.791 --> 41:19.375
I know your little secret.

41:19.458 --> 41:23.500
I don't understand, please,
what Mrs. Squalor is saying.

41:23.583 --> 41:27.166
It's Ms. Squalor. Drop the accent.
It doesn't fool me. I know who you are.

41:27.250 --> 41:28.708
Of course you do.

41:28.791 --> 41:32.458
I am Madame Lulu,
fortune-teller at Caligari Carnival.

41:32.541 --> 41:34.833
And I am Esmé Gigi Geniveve Squalor,

41:34.916 --> 41:37.250
the city's sixth most important
financial advisor.

41:37.333 --> 41:41.875
Don't treat me like some school librarian
who just stepped off the trolley.

41:43.416 --> 41:46.500
That pathetic makeup. That ludicrous wig.

41:46.583 --> 41:49.875
- I know what you're doing.
- And what, please, is that?

41:49.958 --> 41:53.250
You're trying to steal my boyfriend!

41:53.333 --> 41:55.916
What? No.

41:56.916 --> 42:00.583
Please, I do not know
what you are talking about, please.

42:00.666 --> 42:02.208
- Please.
- That's what I said.

42:02.791 --> 42:04.750
It's bad enough I've been dragged
all over,

42:04.833 --> 42:07.166
and there are no in restaurants,
no in boutiques.

42:07.250 --> 42:10.416
I'm forced to make my own dress
out of a few scraps of tent.

42:11.833 --> 42:14.708
I will not be thrown over for a carny.

42:20.125 --> 42:25.500
Stay away from my boyfriend,
or I don't know what I'll do.

42:25.583 --> 42:26.583
Hmm.

42:28.000 --> 42:30.916
It is impossible to know
what any of us will do in the future,

42:31.000 --> 42:33.500
because it is impossible
to know the future.

42:33.583 --> 42:35.291
A crystal ball cannot predict

42:35.375 --> 42:39.125
how a dragonfly might set off an avalanche
by flapping its wings

42:39.208 --> 42:43.833
or a woman in a dragonfly costume will
set off a series of unfortunate events

42:43.916 --> 42:45.625
by stealing a sugar bowl.

42:47.291 --> 42:50.083
- Lulu could be back any second.
- We better hurry.

42:50.166 --> 42:52.916
But there is one thing I do know.
The Baudelaires' lives

42:53.000 --> 42:56.666
were about to be changed
by a surprising arrival.

43:07.916 --> 43:10.125
You!

43:12.666 --> 43:13.625
You.

43:13.708 --> 43:14.750
Who are you?

43:23.041 --> 43:24.666
An old friend, Baudelaires.

43:30.250 --> 43:31.833
I'm glad we've found each other.

43:41.583 --> 43:43.666
As I said, the Baudelaires' lives

43:43.750 --> 43:46.875
were about to be changed
by a surprising arrival.

43:48.625 --> 43:52.541
The surprising arrival
was a pack of starving lions.

43:53.541 --> 43:59.000
And this story is about to get
much, much worse.
