WEBVTT

00:00.333 --> 00:01.701
Previously on
"Gilmore Girls"...

00:01.710 --> 00:02.903
You are leaving for London.

00:02.913 --> 00:04.443
Who knows when we'll
see each other again?

00:04.473 --> 00:07.065
The crazy thing is,
I am ready to get married.

00:07.075 --> 00:08.053
Why are you doing this?

00:08.063 --> 00:08.766
Doing what?

00:08.776 --> 00:10.106
Why are you taking
him away from me?

00:10.136 --> 00:12.164
What other reason is
there but to separate us?

00:12.174 --> 00:13.792
- I don't want to wait anymore.
- I have April.

00:13.827 --> 00:15.700
You're gonna have to figure out
how April fits into our lives.

00:15.733 --> 00:16.771
Not the other way around.

00:16.787 --> 00:18.723
- Just wait.
- No, I'm not waiting!

00:18.739 --> 00:21.692
- It's now or never!
- I don't like ultimatums!

00:26.475 --> 00:27.530
You okay?

00:27.545 --> 00:29.090
I just don't want to be alone.

00:29.107 --> 00:30.372
Come on in.

01:39.887 --> 01:41.003
Hey.

01:41.185 --> 01:42.462
Hey.

01:43.057 --> 01:44.540
What are you doing?

01:44.848 --> 01:48.430
Um... go back to sleep.

01:49.248 --> 01:51.040
Come back to bed.

01:51.185 --> 01:54.101
Oh, I can't. I got to go.

01:54.197 --> 01:55.243
Stay.

01:55.258 --> 01:57.840
No, I can't -- Paul Anka.

01:57.855 --> 01:59.741
Oh, there's no way he's
performing this early.

01:59.756 --> 02:00.613
Check your tickets.

02:00.626 --> 02:02.050
No, I got to go
home and feed him.

02:02.068 --> 02:03.652
Well, let me make
you breakfast first.

02:03.666 --> 02:04.462
No.

02:04.477 --> 02:06.560
Come on, you're no good to Paul
Anka if you collapse from hunger

02:06.598 --> 02:08.761
before you feed him. It's like how,
when you're on an airplane,

02:08.786 --> 02:10.841
you put on your own oxygen
mask before your kids.

02:10.854 --> 02:13.103
- It seems selfish, but --
- No.

02:17.316 --> 02:18.260
Chris.

02:18.278 --> 02:19.412
Lore.

02:19.427 --> 02:20.731
Really.

02:20.745 --> 02:22.242
You sleep.

02:22.258 --> 02:23.650
I got to get going.

02:23.667 --> 02:25.422
- You sure?
- Yeah.

02:25.625 --> 02:27.310
Okay. Bye.

03:33.547 --> 03:36.231
- You're back!
- Ohh! God, Babette, you scared me.

03:36.246 --> 03:38.620
Yeah, it's my voice.
It frightens the hell out of people.

03:38.637 --> 03:39.871
I don't know what
to do about it.

03:39.908 --> 03:42.411
Well, you could start by not
hiding in people's houses

03:42.427 --> 03:43.951
and leaping at them
when they come home.

03:43.988 --> 03:45.413
- It's the nodules.
- Who?

03:45.425 --> 03:46.951
It's the nodules on
my vocal chords.

03:46.967 --> 03:49.201
The more I strain my voice,
the more they grow.

03:49.216 --> 03:51.850
It's nature's way of trying
to get me to talk softer.

03:51.865 --> 03:53.321
Babette, one. Nature, nada.

03:53.337 --> 03:55.491
I bet you're wondering
why I'm here.

03:55.506 --> 03:58.091
Yeah. I mean, not that I'm not happy to
see you. It's just that I have to --

03:58.127 --> 03:59.982
- I'm not a sleepwalker.
- No?

03:59.997 --> 04:01.760
- In case that's what you were thinking.
- No no.

04:01.795 --> 04:04.231
'Cause a lot of people figure
me for one, god knows why.

04:04.247 --> 04:06.920
- I guess I got the look.
- Well, you didn't sleepwalk, though.

04:06.936 --> 04:09.750
Huh-unh. But this morning
I came over here wide awake

04:09.767 --> 04:12.282
'cause I heard Paul Anka doing
that weird yodeling noise

04:12.295 --> 04:14.162
that you said he does when he's hungry,
so I fed him.

04:14.198 --> 04:15.151
Oh good, thank you.

04:15.166 --> 04:18.630
Yeah, I gave him a half a cup of
that kibble that you said he likes,

04:18.648 --> 04:20.771
but then he looked at me like
I stole something from him,

04:20.805 --> 04:21.959
so I gave him a whole cup.

04:21.976 --> 04:23.833
I know that look.
It can be intimidating.

04:23.845 --> 04:25.792
And since our washing
machine is broken --

04:25.805 --> 04:27.511
Morey put his boots in
it and broke it again --

04:27.548 --> 04:29.410
I thought I'd do a
load of my intimates.

04:29.427 --> 04:30.380
Good for you.

04:30.397 --> 04:32.233
- You ain't got any messages.
- What?

04:32.248 --> 04:33.840
- He didn't call.
- Who?

04:33.855 --> 04:36.002
I heard about the fight
between you and Luke.

04:36.017 --> 04:37.122
You did?

04:37.137 --> 04:39.911
Yeah. You know Adrian
Bittenberg's daughter, Becky?

04:39.925 --> 04:41.100
She got a huge mouth.

04:41.115 --> 04:43.970
- Becky is not a gossip.
- But she has a huge mouth.

04:43.985 --> 04:47.113
And she and Eileen Whitewin
were behind Doose's market

04:47.125 --> 04:49.762
seeing how many devil dogs
Becky could stuff in there,

04:49.777 --> 04:52.441
and when she got up to four,
completely cut off her oxygen.

04:52.455 --> 04:55.173
So  Eileen went running over to Luke's
to see if she could get some help,

04:55.207 --> 04:57.981
and then she saw the two of you in
the streets screaming at each other.

04:58.018 --> 05:00.711
Well, I'm glad she had the presence
of mind to listen in on our argument

05:00.747 --> 05:02.231
while her friend was
choking to death.

05:02.267 --> 05:04.850
Don't you worry about a thing, honey.
Everything will be fine.

05:04.865 --> 05:07.260
Every couple needs a good
blowout once in a while.

05:07.278 --> 05:09.520
- It keeps you on your toes.
- Oh, yeah, well...

05:09.538 --> 05:12.782
Yeah. So, did you spend the
night at Sookie's again?

05:12.796 --> 05:13.973
Sookie's?

05:13.985 --> 05:15.321
Yeah, I figured you were there,

05:15.336 --> 05:17.283
but Morey and I did a
power walk this morning,

05:17.296 --> 05:20.021
and we went by her and Jackson's place,
and I didn't see your jeep there.

05:20.056 --> 05:21.640
Babette, I really
got to get going.

05:21.655 --> 05:24.170
Oh, I'm just waiting
for my panties to dry.

05:25.447 --> 05:26.833
I'll pick them up later.

05:26.845 --> 05:30.181
Okay, but could you do me a favor and
put them in a delicate-spin situation,

05:30.197 --> 05:32.120
30 minutes with a
bounce dryer sheet?

05:32.137 --> 05:34.752
Oh, and don't worry, sweetheart.
He'll call.

05:34.765 --> 05:36.523
They always do.

05:53.098 --> 05:56.133
Do you want your kid to spend her life
behind the counter at Dunkin' Donuts?

05:56.136 --> 05:56.971
- Do you?
- No.

05:56.986 --> 05:58.271
Because that's where
she's headed --

05:58.307 --> 06:01.120
selling chocolate donuts and glazed
fritters for the next 40 years

06:01.137 --> 06:04.491
to people in business suits who actually
gave a crap about their academic future.

06:04.508 --> 06:06.323
I just want her to get
into a good school.

06:06.336 --> 06:07.791
She has such potential.

06:07.807 --> 06:08.953
So did Charles Manson.

06:08.965 --> 06:10.461
- What?
- Look at her.

06:10.476 --> 06:12.473
Frankly, it may
already be too late.

06:12.486 --> 06:15.822
I don't particularly like to take
on such meek, diffident cases.

06:15.837 --> 06:18.071
Do you even know what
"diffident" means?

06:18.088 --> 06:20.352
That's okay.
That knowledge isn't really required

06:20.367 --> 06:22.492
in the retail
doughnut-distribution industry.

06:22.507 --> 06:23.873
Please, just give her a chance.

06:23.886 --> 06:25.412
- Why should I?
- Because she needs this.

06:25.447 --> 06:26.932
- Mom.
- Caitlyn.

06:26.947 --> 06:28.742
- What do you think?
- She's got a "C" average,

06:28.777 --> 06:30.971
which means she's
either lazy or stupid.

06:30.985 --> 06:32.110
I can work with either.

06:32.128 --> 06:33.780
Frankly, sometimes
stupid is easier.

06:33.798 --> 06:36.610
I can scare the stupid out of you,
but the lazy runs deep.

06:36.625 --> 06:38.341
- So you'll take her on?
- I will.

06:38.357 --> 06:39.461
- Wonderful.
- Mom!

06:39.477 --> 06:42.312
Caitlyn. Thank you, Paris.
You won't be sorry.

06:42.325 --> 06:45.740
Okay. Now, if I can get you both
to take these aptitude tests,

06:45.757 --> 06:46.821
then we can get to work.

06:46.835 --> 06:48.233
Why do I need to take a test?

06:48.248 --> 06:50.782
I need to get a realistic sense
of Caitlyn's true potential,

06:50.795 --> 06:53.260
and  genetics is by far the
most reliable indicator.

06:53.275 --> 06:54.051
I'm sorry?

06:54.067 --> 06:58.061
Basically, I need to know how much of this 
is her fault and how much of it is yours.

06:58.077 --> 06:59.540
Ticktock.

07:01.966 --> 07:03.241
What  is this?

07:03.256 --> 07:04.251
Pretty great, huh?

07:04.267 --> 07:05.381
Not for Caitlyn.

07:05.398 --> 07:07.620
I was gonna spend the summer
tutoring for the Princeton review,

07:07.656 --> 07:10.402
but then I found they charge
these little morons $60 an hour

07:10.415 --> 07:12.001
and only pay their tutors $20.

07:12.017 --> 07:13.681
So I figured,
"who needs the Princeton review?"

07:13.718 --> 07:15.083
I can open up my own shop.

07:15.097 --> 07:17.442
I've already subcontracted out
to three other student tutors,

07:17.475 --> 07:19.390
and I've got more
prospects lined up.

07:19.406 --> 07:20.551
I'm gonna make a fortune.

07:20.567 --> 07:23.011
Hey, are you interested?
The pay's $15 an hour.

07:23.028 --> 07:23.852
No, thanks.

07:23.863 --> 07:26.581
Wait. Are you looking to use
the offices over the summer?

07:26.597 --> 07:28.473
Just because you're the editor,
that doesn't entitle you

07:28.509 --> 07:31.172
to use the offices during the summer.
There's no paper to put out.

07:31.185 --> 07:32.993
These were up for grabs,
and I grabbed them.

07:33.008 --> 07:34.573
Paris, I don't
want the offices.

07:34.588 --> 07:36.402
Oh. Then,
what are you doing here?

07:36.416 --> 07:38.061
I just came in to
back up my files.

07:38.078 --> 07:39.660
You already backed
up your files.

07:39.678 --> 07:41.420
I saw you do it.

07:41.438 --> 07:43.870
Oh. I get it.
Logan's gone, huh?

07:43.887 --> 07:46.301
He left this morning, early.

07:46.317 --> 07:47.993
- Breakups are tough.
- What?

07:48.008 --> 07:49.842
Eyes on your own
paper, Marilyn!

07:49.856 --> 07:51.452
- We didn't break up.
- You didn't?

07:51.466 --> 07:52.740
No. Why would you say that?

07:52.757 --> 07:55.883
I don't know. Wealthy, good-looking,
hedonistic heir to billion-dollar,

07:55.896 --> 07:58.252
multinational media
conglomerate moves to London

07:58.265 --> 08:01.321
and spends nights pining away
for his college girlfriend?

08:01.338 --> 08:02.930
Who's watching that movie?

08:02.947 --> 08:04.830
Paris, it's not like that.
We're together.

08:04.847 --> 08:06.023
So you guys talked about it?

08:06.035 --> 08:08.582
Yes. Well, no --

08:08.597 --> 08:11.960
I mean, I'm gonna go visit him, though.
We talked about that.

08:11.976 --> 08:13.531
- When?
- I don't know exactly.

08:13.546 --> 08:15.093
So what, specifically,
did you agree to?

08:15.126 --> 08:18.503
Well, nothing, really,
but it was kind of understood.

08:18.517 --> 08:21.113
Yeah. Because that worked
out so well the last time.

08:21.126 --> 08:22.091
Paris.

08:22.108 --> 08:23.470
Has history taught you nothing?

08:23.488 --> 08:26.792
You're in limbo, sister,
no man's land, quite literally.

08:26.818 --> 08:29.263
Logan is not that bright.
You need to spell it out for him.

08:29.277 --> 08:31.003
He's got to know where
the red lines are,

08:31.018 --> 08:34.231
or he's gonna leap right over them and
into bed with multiple british floozies.

08:34.246 --> 08:36.033
Paris, it's okay.
Logan and I are fine.

08:36.047 --> 08:39.030
He moved to London, Rory --
the most romantic city in the world.

08:39.048 --> 08:40.773
Paris is the most romantic
city in the world.

08:40.804 --> 08:44.033
Oh, right.
London is just the most sex-obsessed.

08:44.506 --> 08:46.091
Pencil's down!

08:50.617 --> 08:52.060
Hey.

08:56.247 --> 08:57.712
I can't. I'm late for work.

08:57.727 --> 08:58.583
Can we talk first?

08:58.598 --> 08:59.723
Please, I really don't want to.

08:59.758 --> 09:00.791
Lorelai, come on.

09:00.808 --> 09:02.240
No, Luke, we did talk.

09:02.255 --> 09:04.840
We talked last night.
There's nothing left to say.

09:04.856 --> 09:07.602
I'm sorry about yesterday, but you
kind of ambushed me, out of nowhere,

09:07.635 --> 09:09.070
and then you didn't
give me a chance.

09:09.108 --> 09:10.241
I gave you every chance.

09:10.257 --> 09:11.702
You were going so fast.

09:11.715 --> 09:12.891
Yeah, that's me. I'm fast.

09:12.906 --> 09:14.922
I'm the perfect storm of
caffeine and genetics.

09:14.936 --> 09:17.400
I know, but now I've had a chance to
catch up, and I want to discuss it.

09:17.437 --> 09:19.661
Discuss what?
There's nothing left to discuss.

09:19.677 --> 09:21.612
Us -- you and me.

09:21.625 --> 09:24.922
There is no us.
There's you, and there's me. It's over.

09:24.937 --> 09:27.432
It was over last night,
and it's over now. It's over.

09:27.445 --> 09:29.930
- Lorelai --
- No, I'm sorry. I have to go.

09:41.997 --> 09:44.530
- You're going down.
- No.

09:44.546 --> 09:45.802
You think you're so great.

09:45.818 --> 09:48.002
- You think you're miss la-di-da.
- Ow.

09:48.016 --> 09:51.383
But look at you now,
all weak and pitiful.

09:51.397 --> 09:53.712
That's it. Give in to the pain.

09:53.725 --> 09:55.852
- So, how's my acting?
- What do you mean?

09:55.867 --> 09:59.840
Well, is it believable, or do you
find it a little over-the-top?!

09:59.856 --> 10:02.973
My  fingers!
My fingers are smashed!

10:02.988 --> 10:04.853
Ha! How do you like
them apples, Michel?

10:04.865 --> 10:06.463
I do not like these apples.
You cheated.

10:06.477 --> 10:08.090
You hustled me.
You played possum.

10:08.105 --> 10:09.802
Oh, no, I played arm-wrestling.

10:09.817 --> 10:11.352
Or did you think we were
playing some other game?

10:11.387 --> 10:12.410
Is that why you lost so bad?

10:12.446 --> 10:14.641
Your gloating is
very distasteful.

10:14.657 --> 10:15.862
Ouch!

10:15.876 --> 10:20.041
Lorelai, I may need to take some
time off to have my wrist x-rayed.

10:20.057 --> 10:21.273
Excuse me.

10:21.287 --> 10:23.773
I am the champion, my friend

10:23.785 --> 10:26.770
And I'll keep on
fighting till the end

10:26.785 --> 10:29.502
No time for losers

10:29.516 --> 10:32.762
Oh! I am a
fantastic arm-wrestler.

10:32.776 --> 10:34.862
You know what I think did it?
The whisking --

10:34.875 --> 10:38.453
all those years of whiskin has given
me incredible forearm strength.

10:38.468 --> 10:41.801
People are always like, "why take
the time to hand-whip fresh cream?

10:41.817 --> 10:43.773
Why not use a machine?"

10:43.788 --> 10:45.673
And I've always been like,
"I don't know why I do it.

10:45.705 --> 10:48.731
It's just something that
I do." But now I know --

10:48.745 --> 10:52.153
because I've been training
for this very day.

10:52.166 --> 10:54.571
I mean, wow! I am strong.

10:54.585 --> 10:57.233
And the omelet flipping
definitely is part of it.

10:57.245 --> 11:00.503
You know when you use one of those
really heavy cast-iron skillets,

11:00.515 --> 11:02.041
and you flip, flip?

11:02.058 --> 11:04.103
I mean, that's all in the wrist,
you know?

11:04.116 --> 11:05.613
And that's what they say.

11:05.625 --> 11:07.692
You know, that's what people
say about arm-wrestling, too --

11:07.726 --> 11:09.540
that it's all in the wrist,

11:09.558 --> 11:13.981
and, man, I have super-bionic,
superpowered, super wrists.

11:13.996 --> 11:16.792
I mean,
who knew I possessed such --

11:17.078 --> 11:18.173
Honey?

11:18.186 --> 11:19.902
Something's wrong, huh?

11:19.915 --> 11:20.682
Yeah.

11:20.697 --> 11:22.800
It's not spiders
on the ceiling.

11:22.818 --> 11:24.681
You know I hate spiders.

11:24.695 --> 11:26.393
I was kind of hoping
it was spiders.

11:26.408 --> 11:27.371
It's not spiders.

11:27.388 --> 11:28.682
- No?
- No.

11:28.698 --> 11:29.743
Okay.

11:29.755 --> 11:31.201
Luke and I are over.

11:31.218 --> 11:32.892
- Over?
- Yeah.

11:32.906 --> 11:34.510
- No.
- Yeah.

11:34.528 --> 11:36.793
- Have you guys had a fight?
- We had the fight.

11:36.805 --> 11:39.242
People have fights. It's okay.

11:39.258 --> 11:41.611
It's good, actually.
You know, it's healthy.

11:41.627 --> 11:43.421
If you don't have fights,
all these bad chemicals build up,

11:43.455 --> 11:45.453
and you get ulcers
and bad skin.

11:45.467 --> 11:47.660
You got such pretty skin,
so you have to have some fights

11:47.695 --> 11:49.063
for the sake of your skin.

11:49.076 --> 11:50.562
This was different.
This was bad.

11:50.576 --> 11:52.283
People have bad fights.

11:52.298 --> 11:54.793
Every bad fight can
seem like "the fight."

11:54.808 --> 11:57.113
It wasn't just a fight, Sookie.

11:57.125 --> 12:00.052
It was him not fighting for me.

12:00.068 --> 12:01.842
I gave him an ultimatum.

12:01.857 --> 12:04.193
- And?
- And he let me walk away.

12:04.206 --> 12:06.061
No. He'll come back.

12:06.075 --> 12:07.973
He'll be back. He'll come back.

12:07.985 --> 12:10.050
Luke wants to marry you.

12:10.065 --> 12:11.711
I know he does.

12:11.726 --> 12:14.641
I mean, he'll come around.
He'll get it together.

12:14.657 --> 12:15.651
I'm done.

12:15.668 --> 12:17.642
I don't want to see him anymore.
It's over.

12:17.655 --> 12:19.721
I  get that you're mad.
You deserve to be mad.

12:19.738 --> 12:21.960
Luke's been a real jerk.
Frankly, being mad at him

12:21.976 --> 12:23.840
makes all the
sense in the world.

12:23.855 --> 12:27.490
And if you're so mad that you need to
believe you guys are over, I get that.

12:27.508 --> 12:31.411
Sookie, I spent the night
with Christopher last night.

12:32.117 --> 12:34.250
You spent the night with
Christopher last night?

12:34.266 --> 12:35.862
- Spent the night.
- With Christopher?

12:35.878 --> 12:36.891
Yeah.

12:36.908 --> 12:38.153
Okay. So, does Luke know?

12:38.167 --> 12:40.252
No. I don't want
him to ever know.

12:40.267 --> 12:42.580
That's good. That's good.

12:42.596 --> 12:44.022
Uh, okay.

12:44.038 --> 12:46.391
Uh, look -- things happen.

12:46.408 --> 12:49.192
People... people do things.
It's not pretty.

12:49.208 --> 12:51.331
It's not Disney,
but it's the real world.

12:51.347 --> 12:52.803
And you don't have to tell him.

12:52.815 --> 12:55.483
Luke doesn't have to know,
and things don't have to be over.

12:55.498 --> 12:58.313
No, you don't get it.
I need it to be over.

12:58.328 --> 13:01.990
I need it to be over because
I can't take this anymore.

13:02.008 --> 13:04.592
Yes, I love Luke, and, yes,
I wanted to marry Luke.

13:04.616 --> 13:07.571
But I didn't want a life
separate from Luke,

13:07.587 --> 13:10.140
and that's all he could give me.
I don't want that.

13:10.158 --> 13:12.442
If I'm gonna be with Luke,
I want to be with Luke,

13:12.455 --> 13:16.001
and he didn't get it, and I waited.
I mean, god, I waited.

13:16.015 --> 13:18.271
It's like Luke is
driving a car, okay,

13:18.287 --> 13:20.723
and I just want to be in
the passenger's seat.

13:20.738 --> 13:22.502
But he's locked
the door, and...

13:22.518 --> 13:25.403
and so I have to hold onto the bumper,
you know?

13:25.415 --> 13:27.182
I'm not even asking him
to open the door for me.

13:27.215 --> 13:28.932
Just leave it unlocked and say,
"come in."

13:28.945 --> 13:32.143
But no, he didn't do that,
so I'm hanging onto the bumper,

13:32.156 --> 13:33.910
and life goes on,
and the car goes on,

13:33.925 --> 13:37.543
and I get really badly
bruised and hitting potholes.

13:37.555 --> 13:39.423
And it hurts. I mean, it hurts.

13:39.438 --> 13:44.053
So yesterday I had to let go of the
bumper because it hurts too much.

13:44.067 --> 13:46.241
It hurts too much.

13:48.565 --> 13:50.020
Okay.

13:55.445 --> 13:58.013
- Caesar, where the hell is Lane?
- She's on her honeymoon.

13:58.026 --> 14:00.391
- Jeez, how long is that gonna last?
- It's only been a week.

14:00.428 --> 14:02.450
Only? Seven days seems
like plenty of time

14:02.466 --> 14:04.923
to sit in some mountain cabin together
and realize you've just changed yourself

14:04.957 --> 14:07.771
to another human being
for all eternity.

14:07.787 --> 14:11.160
They went to Mexico, so they're
probably doing that on a beach.

14:11.178 --> 14:13.621
Maybe it takes a little longer to realize, 
you know, with the hot sun and all.

14:13.655 --> 14:15.320
Ceasar, are you being funny?

14:15.335 --> 14:17.190
- You tell me.
- No, you tell me.

14:17.206 --> 14:19.182
- It would appear not.
- Bus those tables.

14:19.197 --> 14:22.041
Luke, I asked for these eggs scrambled,
and they're sunny-side up.

14:24.638 --> 14:25.880
There you go.

14:27.297 --> 14:29.033
Oh, now what?

14:29.047 --> 14:31.191
Caesar, I'll be right back.

14:33.258 --> 14:34.722
Don't hurry.

14:36.576 --> 14:38.361
Now, carefully. Carefully.

14:38.375 --> 14:40.261
That's rental equipment.
I'm responsible for that.

14:40.296 --> 14:41.392
Taylor, what the
hell are you doing?

14:41.427 --> 14:43.873
Good morning, Lucas.
You look in fine fettle today.

14:43.885 --> 14:45.570
Okay, whatever you're doing,
stop it.

14:45.588 --> 14:47.750
That's rather cynical. Now, who's
to say I'm not doing something here

14:47.787 --> 14:49.092
that will surprise
and delight you?

14:49.127 --> 14:50.440
- Are you?
- I highly doubt it.

14:50.456 --> 14:52.141
- Then stop it.
- Can't do it, Luke.

14:52.157 --> 14:54.611
The safety of the citizens
of Stars Hollow is at stake,

14:54.627 --> 14:56.291
and that has to be
my top priority,

14:56.306 --> 14:58.711
regardless of how you feel
about a red-light camera.

14:58.728 --> 14:59.652
A what?

14:59.668 --> 15:02.483
To catch scofflaws. Apparently, people
are viewing our traffic light here

15:02.515 --> 15:05.302
as more a series of colorful
driving suggestions

15:05.316 --> 15:06.803
rather than the
rules of the road.

15:06.817 --> 15:09.932
Therefore, I decided to
install a red-light camera

15:09.948 --> 15:12.950
to discourage drivers
who would test our laws

15:12.967 --> 15:14.883
and photograph and
punish those who do.

15:14.897 --> 15:15.983
A camera?

15:15.997 --> 15:19.161
You run a red light, it's time
for your close-up, Mr. Demille.

15:19.178 --> 15:21.290
These little wonders are
taking over the globe --

15:21.307 --> 15:23.442
New York, Los Angeles,
Paris, Singapore.

15:23.458 --> 15:24.361
That's ridiculous.

15:24.378 --> 15:26.812
They're in position and ready for
the installation as you say so.

15:26.847 --> 15:29.130
You can't do this.
It's an invasion of privacy.

15:29.146 --> 15:30.281
Something to fear, Luke?

15:30.295 --> 15:33.400
You can't take pictures of
people for driving by the diner.

15:33.418 --> 15:34.903
It's probably not even legal.

15:34.915 --> 15:36.593
Spoken like a man with
something to hide.

15:36.608 --> 15:38.842
Luke, I can assure you that
I am well within my rights

15:38.855 --> 15:40.800
as town selectman to
install that camera,

15:40.815 --> 15:42.671
and you, of all people,
should be grateful.

15:42.688 --> 15:45.481
After all, it'll make the street in
front of your diner that much safer.

15:45.516 --> 15:46.810
Or unsafer,
if you know what I mean.

15:46.845 --> 15:49.280
There hasn't been an accident
on that corner in 15 years.

15:49.298 --> 15:51.591
And now we've made it safe
for the next 15. Hooray!

15:51.605 --> 15:52.791
I'm gonna fight you
on this, Taylor.

15:52.826 --> 15:55.823
We will be having the official
unveiling ceremony later this afternoon.

15:55.838 --> 15:56.951
You're welcome to attend.

15:56.966 --> 15:59.791
I don't see how I can avoid it, considering 
it's right in front of my damn diner!

15:59.828 --> 16:01.863
I'll put you down for plus one.

16:01.875 --> 16:04.811
Oh, and we're going to have to
cross up some electrical lines

16:04.826 --> 16:06.140
during the
installation process,

16:06.158 --> 16:08.541
so you might lose
power for a few hours.

16:11.106 --> 16:12.053
Hi.

16:12.067 --> 16:15.042
What?! The prodigal
daughter returns.

16:15.056 --> 16:16.181
What are you doing here?

16:16.195 --> 16:17.952
I couldn't stay away.
I just missed you too much.

16:17.985 --> 16:21.042
Aren't you the sweetest?
Isn't she the sweetest, Michel?

16:21.057 --> 16:23.383
Beyond all human understanding.

16:23.397 --> 16:24.843
Hi, Michel.

16:24.857 --> 16:27.871
Yes, it hurts very much.

16:27.886 --> 16:29.571
Yay! So you're back.

16:29.585 --> 16:31.791
Yeah. I just had to
get out of there.

16:31.808 --> 16:33.420
Aw. How was the goodbye?

16:33.436 --> 16:35.440
Awful. There's nothing
good about a goodbye.

16:35.455 --> 16:38.461
It's a very poorly named ritual.
It was a bad bye, a very bad bye.

16:38.477 --> 16:40.680
Then I went to the newsroom
to talk to Paris about it --

16:40.717 --> 16:41.652
You what?

16:41.667 --> 16:43.520
Well, I didn't mean to.
She was just there,

16:43.538 --> 16:46.320
and she spent 10 minutes
kicking me while I was down.

16:46.337 --> 16:48.861
Paris is always there for you
in the most unfortunate ways.

16:48.876 --> 16:50.132
I just miss him so much.

16:50.147 --> 16:51.100
I know you do.

16:51.117 --> 16:53.933
And it's only been seven hours.
Can you imagine when it's been --

16:53.945 --> 16:56.280
You know what? I don't want to
talk about it. I need coffee.

16:56.316 --> 16:58.851
Okay.  You sure, though,
you don't want to talk?

16:58.866 --> 17:02.102
You can always vent to me.
I'm the perfect vent-erizer --

17:02.117 --> 17:03.721
vent-erator.

17:03.735 --> 17:07.262
Mom, I don't need a vent-erator.
I just don't want to talk about it.

17:07.275 --> 17:08.910
What's going on with you?

17:08.925 --> 17:11.893
Oh. With me?
Oh, well, things with me --

17:11.906 --> 17:13.553
things with me are good.

17:13.566 --> 17:14.829
Convincing.

17:14.847 --> 17:17.443
Things with me friends are good.
Things with me Inn are good.

17:17.457 --> 17:19.240
- Things with me, not so good.
- What's up?

17:19.258 --> 17:20.800
Look, I don't want to talk
about this right now, okay?

17:20.837 --> 17:23.893
But I want to tell you. I have to tell,
but I'm barely holding it together as it is.

17:23.928 --> 17:26.520
So if I tell you, will you
promise not to make me discuss it?

17:26.535 --> 17:27.942
What?

17:28.257 --> 17:29.620
Luke and I split up.

17:29.637 --> 17:31.210
What do you mean,
like you got into a fight?

17:31.245 --> 17:33.811
No, like we had a breakup,
like a real-life parting of the hearts.

17:33.845 --> 17:35.130
Why? What happened?

17:35.145 --> 17:36.551
Rory, you promised.

17:36.566 --> 17:37.241
No, I didn't.

17:37.256 --> 17:39.201
- Well, it was implied. Please.
- Mom.

17:39.216 --> 17:40.411
Rory, I don't want
to talk about it.

17:40.447 --> 17:42.940
- But you have to explain.
- No, not right now, okay?

17:42.957 --> 17:45.121
Look --
you got to not talk about your thing.

17:45.136 --> 17:47.301
So I didn't vent-erator you.
You don't vent-erator me.

17:47.316 --> 17:49.872
- But --
- Rory, please.

17:50.756 --> 17:53.121
Well, you know, I guess we
don't have to talk about stuff.

17:53.138 --> 17:56.083
Yeah. Who says we always
have to be talking?

17:56.098 --> 17:57.391
We can not talk.

17:57.406 --> 17:58.603
Of course we can.

17:58.618 --> 18:00.042
Okay.

18:00.058 --> 18:02.301
We should probably talk about
how we're not gonna talk,

18:02.318 --> 18:04.493
'cause I don't think we
should just go right into it.

18:04.505 --> 18:06.301
Let's do something that
doesn't require talking.

18:06.335 --> 18:07.662
Like, we could go
to the movies.

18:07.678 --> 18:09.080
You want to try not
talking at a movie?

18:09.117 --> 18:10.262
- Okay, shopping.
- Are you mad?

18:10.297 --> 18:13.302
We could drink. We could go to
a bar and just throw back a few.

18:13.315 --> 18:15.202
Yeah, 'cause drunk people
never feel like talking.

18:15.236 --> 18:16.823
Oh! We could go to a club.

18:16.837 --> 18:19.032
Yeah, 'cause all the hot spots
get rolling right about lunchtime.

18:19.067 --> 18:20.602
See? This is why
men play sports.

18:20.618 --> 18:22.662
- Sports. We can play sports.
- We hate sports.

18:22.677 --> 18:24.001
We haven't tried every sport.

18:24.015 --> 18:24.993
How about running?

18:25.007 --> 18:26.673
We could easily talk
while we're running.

18:26.685 --> 18:28.111
Not if we were hurdling.

18:28.125 --> 18:30.330
Hurdles require more focus and,
thus, less talking.

18:30.346 --> 18:31.780
Or we could do that
kind of running

18:31.795 --> 18:35.350
that's like you leap around
a tree and up a hill --

18:35.367 --> 18:36.783
You want to run cross-country.

18:36.796 --> 18:38.880
Not across the whole country,
maybe just Michigan.

18:38.898 --> 18:40.382
Michel, what sports
do you play?

18:40.398 --> 18:43.140
Well, since I'm maimed
potentially for life,

18:43.157 --> 18:45.090
I may never play sports again.

18:45.105 --> 18:48.443
But think back to before this tragic,
life-altering injury,

18:48.458 --> 18:51.163
when life was still worth living.
What sports did you play then?

18:51.177 --> 18:53.120
Well, pilates, of course.

18:53.135 --> 18:53.790
What?

18:53.805 --> 18:55.381
It's like yoga with
cables and wires.

18:55.397 --> 18:56.370
Sounds very dangerous.

18:56.386 --> 18:59.121
Oh, racquetball is also
a fantastic workout.

18:59.137 --> 19:01.162
- Racquetball?
- Intriguing.

19:01.178 --> 19:03.213
I always liked the
sound of racquetball.

19:03.228 --> 19:04.933
Tell us more about
this racquetball.

19:04.946 --> 19:06.721
Well, it's very simple --

19:06.737 --> 19:09.643
a 4-walled room, a racquet,
and a rubber ball.

19:09.657 --> 19:11.320
Get to the good part.
What are the clothes like?

19:11.357 --> 19:12.612
Can we wear cute outfits?

19:12.627 --> 19:13.282
I do.

19:13.295 --> 19:14.652
I think racquetball
sounds great.

19:14.666 --> 19:16.672
- Mmm, I'm in.
- Okay, good.

19:16.688 --> 19:19.250
Go home. And I need to finish
up a few things around here.

19:19.267 --> 19:20.270
I'll see you there
in about an hour.

19:20.306 --> 19:21.232
Deal. Yeah, fun.

19:21.247 --> 19:22.573
Okay. And no talking.

19:22.585 --> 19:26.651
Except for smack talking because I am
so gonna kick your butt in racquetball.

19:26.667 --> 19:30.093
No no, I mean, my balls -- they're gonna
bounce way further than your balls.

19:30.107 --> 19:33.963
Okay, well,
you haven't seen my great top...

19:34.315 --> 19:36.761
- flick wrist --
- We'll learn the terms.

19:36.777 --> 19:38.440
Okay, go home and study.

19:45.708 --> 19:47.443
- Hello?
- Miss me?

19:47.456 --> 19:48.832
Logan, where are you?

19:48.846 --> 19:50.072
Heathrow. I just landed.

19:50.088 --> 19:51.952
- I miss you so much.
- I miss you, too.

19:51.967 --> 19:54.401
I've been here 2 1/2 minutes,
and I can already tell it sucks.

19:54.437 --> 19:56.451
It does suck.
I've heard that about London.

19:56.465 --> 19:58.281
You should just get on
a plane and come home.

19:58.296 --> 19:59.400
You gave it a chance.

19:59.416 --> 20:01.930
Are you on campus? I tried you at the
apartment, but I didn't get an answer.

20:01.966 --> 20:03.712
No, I'm back at Stars Hollow.

20:03.727 --> 20:06.100
That apartment suddenly
felt very big and empty.

20:06.117 --> 20:07.620
So, what are you gonna do with
your first day of freedom?

20:07.655 --> 20:09.700
Oh, going to play
racquetball with my mom.

20:09.717 --> 20:11.291
This is a really
bad connection.

20:11.306 --> 20:13.643
It sounded like you were gonna
play racquetball with your mom.

20:13.675 --> 20:16.242
Hey, I could have a hidden
talent for it, you never know.

20:16.256 --> 20:18.522
- So did you open my gift?
- Of course.

20:18.535 --> 20:20.141
What did you think?

20:20.158 --> 20:22.652
I thought... wow.

20:22.665 --> 20:24.401
Yeah, pretty cool, right?

20:24.416 --> 20:25.643
So cool.

20:25.658 --> 20:27.391
Oh, I'm glad you like it.

20:27.407 --> 20:29.462
Like it? I love it.

20:29.475 --> 20:30.670
I'm so glad you got it.

20:30.688 --> 20:32.451
Oh, yeah, totally.

20:32.465 --> 20:34.931
When I left, I suddenly got worried you
wouldn't get it. But of course you got it.

20:34.967 --> 20:37.441
Yeah, of course.
Of course, I got it. I loved it.

20:37.458 --> 20:38.703
I knew you would.

20:38.715 --> 20:39.892
All right, Ace, I got to go.

20:39.905 --> 20:41.802
I just wanted to tell you I
touched down. I'll call later.

20:41.836 --> 20:44.092
Okay, bye. And thank you.

20:44.105 --> 20:45.480
Of course.

20:51.267 --> 20:53.171
Like a remote-control rocket?

20:53.187 --> 20:55.113
No, like a model rocket.

20:55.126 --> 20:56.770
How big?

20:56.785 --> 20:59.550
Is it filled with anything?
Gum or candy or anything?

20:59.565 --> 21:00.272
Gum.

21:00.287 --> 21:02.031
What? Rocket gum.
It could be a thing.

21:02.048 --> 21:03.360
There was no gum in it.

21:03.376 --> 21:05.243
It doesn't have a
button you can push?

21:05.255 --> 21:07.882
No, nothing like that.
It's just a model rocket.

21:07.896 --> 21:10.181
I mean, what could that mean?
Who gives someone a rocket?

21:10.198 --> 21:12.052
I don't know. I don't know.
We'll figure it out, though.

21:12.086 --> 21:15.462
Rocket, rocket, rocket.
Rocket man -- "Rocket man."

21:15.475 --> 21:19.800
"Crocodile rock" was good. "Bennie
and the jets," "Candle in the wind."

21:19.815 --> 21:21.541
Are you just naming
Elton John songs?

21:21.556 --> 21:23.150
He is just so talented.

21:23.166 --> 21:25.242
Ugh. What about space?

21:25.256 --> 21:26.882
It's the final frontier?

21:26.896 --> 21:28.382
- Oh, no.
- What?

21:28.397 --> 21:31.782
What if he was trying to say that
he wanted space away from me?

21:31.795 --> 21:32.751
No.

21:32.766 --> 21:36.322
Oh, hi, we're not done racquetballing.
We've got it for like an hour.

21:36.336 --> 21:37.382
Thanks, though.

21:37.398 --> 21:38.990
Hey, maybe it's code.

21:39.005 --> 21:41.771
Like I'm his rocket, right?

21:41.788 --> 21:43.801
Like I'm his rock, E.T.

21:43.818 --> 21:46.202
I'm his rock in the
eastern time zone.

21:46.217 --> 21:46.990
That's dumb.

21:47.005 --> 21:48.941
Yeah, like rocket gum
is sweeping the nation.

21:48.957 --> 21:51.782
When I have made $1 zillion

21:51.795 --> 21:53.542
from my rocket-gum invention,

21:53.555 --> 21:54.721
you will eat those words.

21:54.738 --> 21:56.740
Or more likely,
chew those words

21:56.758 --> 21:58.933
and blow a bubble with them,
'cause did I mention

21:58.947 --> 22:00.773
that rocket gum is bubble gum?

22:00.787 --> 22:03.193
But instead of blowing bubbles,
it releases helium

22:03.208 --> 22:05.402
that shoots the
chewer up into space.

22:05.416 --> 22:07.492
I don't think this is
helping me understand

22:07.506 --> 22:09.423
the state of my
relationship with Logan.

22:09.437 --> 22:11.301
And we're not even
supposed to be talking.

22:11.317 --> 22:13.691
- You started it.
- I did start it.

22:13.708 --> 22:16.610
So maybe now you would
like to talk about Luke?

22:16.627 --> 22:18.691
You know what,
I'd rather racquetball.

22:18.706 --> 22:19.573
Seriously?

22:19.588 --> 22:20.862
Come on.

22:22.997 --> 22:24.173
What do you think?

22:24.186 --> 22:25.192
Against the wall?

22:25.208 --> 22:26.423
- Yeah, why not.
- Okay.

22:26.435 --> 22:28.061
- Ready?
- Ready.

22:32.066 --> 22:33.810
- You okay?
- Okay.

22:33.827 --> 22:35.443
We're done.

22:36.618 --> 22:38.523
See, it's starting to swell.

22:38.535 --> 22:39.901
It is starting to swell.

22:39.915 --> 22:41.670
Either that or the rest
of my face is shrinking.

22:41.707 --> 22:43.233
I think we should
put something on it.

22:43.245 --> 22:44.823
Uh, concealer and loose powder?

22:44.838 --> 22:46.392
Ice, mom.
I think we should put ice on it.

22:46.426 --> 22:48.780
So boring.
Neosporin and an eye patch?

22:48.796 --> 22:51.973
Bactine, bacitracin, hydrogen peroxide.
Winnie The Pooh band-aids?

22:51.988 --> 22:53.592
I'm getting you some ice.

22:54.218 --> 22:56.910
Good lord.
Where'd I get all this stuff?

22:57.165 --> 22:58.672
How can you not have ice?

22:58.688 --> 23:00.122
You know I don't cook.

23:00.135 --> 23:02.521
That is not cooking.
That is the opposite of cooking.

23:02.537 --> 23:05.143
That's freezing. All you have in
here are like batteries and film

23:05.156 --> 23:08.261
and something I think used
to be an ice cream sandwich.

23:08.276 --> 23:11.620
- How old is that film?
- Ugh, 1999.

23:11.636 --> 23:14.152
Bad hair year for me,
skirts were the wrong length,

23:14.166 --> 23:16.533
cut me right at the calf.
I can't bring myself to develop it.

23:16.568 --> 23:18.230
You're not putting
shaving cream on your eye.

23:18.268 --> 23:21.953
No, just getting rid of
some of Luke's things.

23:22.198 --> 23:23.732
- Steak.
- Huh?

23:23.748 --> 23:25.620
Steak is supposed to be
good for a black eye.

23:25.637 --> 23:26.861
Frozen peas.

23:26.875 --> 23:28.383
Why would I put peas in my eye?

23:28.398 --> 23:31.402
No, like a bag of frozen peas.
It molds to the contour of your face.

23:31.417 --> 23:33.040
But steak has actual
healing properties.

23:33.057 --> 23:35.631
Something about the juices or
the fats is good for the skin.

23:35.645 --> 23:37.291
I'm going to Doose's
to get you some ice.

23:37.308 --> 23:39.222
And steak. And peas.
And ice cream!

23:39.238 --> 23:40.530
That would feel good on my eye.

23:40.548 --> 23:43.873
And then when I'm done using it,
we can eat it.

23:43.886 --> 23:45.220
It's black-eye dinner.

23:45.236 --> 23:46.842
Says the woman who
can't cook ice.

23:46.857 --> 23:49.480
Oh please. I'm not gonna cook.
I'm too injured. You cook.

23:49.496 --> 23:53.001
And get some bacitracin. Whatever
we use it for, we're almost out.

23:53.017 --> 23:55.043
- Be right back.
- Thanks.

23:56.266 --> 23:58.000
See if he has eye patches.

23:58.015 --> 24:00.172
Okay, everyone, gather 'round.

24:00.187 --> 24:02.292
Witness the miracle
of modern...

24:02.308 --> 24:04.752
Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

24:04.765 --> 24:06.633
What, does this look
like a soup kitchen?

24:06.647 --> 24:08.073
Well, it's a little depressing,
but no --

24:08.107 --> 24:11.000
- Pay your bill.
- Oh, right, sorry.

24:11.207 --> 24:13.990
- I wasn't trying to skip out or anything.
- Get lost.

24:21.947 --> 24:24.742
There's nobody left to serve,
and I certainly don't want your company.

24:24.747 --> 24:26.191
Thanks, Luke.

24:27.196 --> 24:29.382
Hi, miss Patty.
Hey, Gypsy. Hi, Lulu.

24:29.397 --> 24:30.982
- Rory!
- Hi, Rory.

24:30.998 --> 24:33.272
Look at the college girl.
You home for the summer, chicky?

24:33.306 --> 24:34.003
I am

24:34.018 --> 24:35.221
You look wonderful.

24:35.238 --> 24:37.623
If I had known that college
was so good for the complexion,

24:37.636 --> 24:39.771
I might have cracked a book
open when I was younger.

24:39.786 --> 24:40.842
Oh, thanks.

24:40.857 --> 24:42.833
Your mom said you might
be traveling in Asia.

24:42.848 --> 24:43.803
She's not in Asia.

24:43.816 --> 24:45.242
I didn't know you
were going to Asia.

24:45.276 --> 24:47.292
I was talking about it,
but that's not gonna happen.

24:47.325 --> 24:49.163
Well, your mom must be
happy to have you home.

24:49.166 --> 24:51.170
Yeah, she is.
What's going on here?

24:51.186 --> 24:53.423
Taylor's putting a camera
on the traffic light.

24:53.435 --> 24:54.983
Big brother is watching.

24:54.995 --> 24:56.781
Okay, everyone.
Thanks for coming.

24:56.798 --> 25:00.372
Now, as you know,
small-town law enforcement

25:00.386 --> 25:01.830
presents many challenges.

25:01.846 --> 25:05.282
Chief among them, how to police our
streets without an actual police force.

25:05.297 --> 25:07.841
Fortunately for the
citizens of Stars Hollow,

25:07.855 --> 25:11.660
the fine people at Ingram Traffic
Systems have provided an answer.

25:11.677 --> 25:13.462
I would now like to present

25:13.478 --> 25:17.733
the latest and greatest weapon in
unmanned high-tech law enforcement.

25:17.745 --> 25:19.341
Ladies and gentlemen,

25:19.357 --> 25:23.500
the auto patrol P.R. 100.

25:25.948 --> 25:28.013
How it works is very simple.

25:28.028 --> 25:30.493
When someone drives
through the red light,

25:30.508 --> 25:33.441
the camera will take
three successive pictures

25:33.455 --> 25:36.622
of the offending party at
closer and closer range.

25:36.635 --> 25:38.251
Seems kind of intrusive to me.

25:38.268 --> 25:41.890
Law-abiding citizens have
nothing to worry about.

25:41.905 --> 25:48.632
Now, we are going to have our ceremonial
first lawbreaker played by Kirk.

25:48.647 --> 25:53.463
Kirk will drive my classic
1964 Ford Thunderbird

25:53.475 --> 25:56.170
down the street,
through the red light,

25:56.188 --> 25:59.770
and the auto patrol P.R.
100 will capture him

25:59.786 --> 26:02.952
in all his law-breaking glory.

26:02.968 --> 26:05.412
- Miss Patty?
- I'm on it.

26:31.668 --> 26:34.170
I'm okay! I'm okay!

26:40.796 --> 26:43.050
Okay, do you remember when
you begged me to go see

26:43.066 --> 26:45.530
"The fast and the furious" with you,
and I said no?

26:45.548 --> 26:47.012
And then you begged
me to go see

26:47.028 --> 26:49.053
"The fast and the furious 2" with you,
and I said no?

26:49.086 --> 26:52.751
Then "The fast anthe furious 3:
Tokyo drift" came out...

26:52.765 --> 26:54.043
They're cars, they drift.

26:54.058 --> 26:57.180
And I was like,
"I said no to 1 and I said no to 2 --

26:57.196 --> 26:59.770
"what do you think happened here,
I got a brain transplant or something?"

26:59.806 --> 27:01.261
I remember. You were very rude.

27:01.277 --> 27:04.211
Well, I was wrong,
because I have finally understood

27:04.227 --> 27:06.391
the awesomeness of cars
crashing into things,

27:06.405 --> 27:08.003
which is a long-winded
way of saying that

27:08.036 --> 27:10.413
Taylor installed this red-light
camera in front of Luke's,

27:10.427 --> 27:13.213
and Kirk was supposed to
demonstrate how it worked,

27:13.226 --> 27:15.591
but he got totally
blinded by the camera,

27:15.608 --> 27:18.942
and he ended up crashing
Taylor's fancy blue T-bird --

27:18.955 --> 27:20.401
which, by the way, who knew? --

27:20.418 --> 27:22.290
into the side of Luke's.

27:22.306 --> 27:23.861
And nobody was hurt.
Everything was fine.

27:23.895 --> 27:25.803
But the smash-up
was unbelievable.

27:25.817 --> 27:27.501
And it went right into Luke's

27:27.515 --> 27:29.691
and then Kirk gets up,
he gets out of thet car,

27:29.706 --> 27:33.460
and he's all like, Evel Knievel style,
like, "I'm okay, I'm okay."

27:33.477 --> 27:34.672
And... um...

27:34.687 --> 27:36.842
why is everything you own in
piles all over the floor?

27:36.858 --> 27:39.161
Wait a minute.
Into the diner and nobody was hurt?

27:39.175 --> 27:40.761
Yeah, everything's fine.
But what is this?

27:40.798 --> 27:42.940
There must've been a lot of damage.
Are you sure everybody's okay?

27:42.978 --> 27:46.680
Oh, it was a mess, but everything's
fine, I swear. What is this?

27:46.695 --> 27:49.573
I'm just getting some of
Luke's stuff together.

27:49.587 --> 27:51.492
- This is Luke's?
- No, this is mine.

27:51.506 --> 27:54.863
But I wore it with Luke when
we went to see "Jarhe."

27:54.876 --> 27:56.632
I was trying to
look kind of army,

27:56.648 --> 27:59.160
and something about the combination
of the movie and the hot dogs

27:59.198 --> 28:01.452
at the Waterbury cineplex made
me sick in the parking lot,

28:01.488 --> 28:04.892
and Luke held my hair, and it was nice,
and now I got to get rid of it.

28:05.857 --> 28:08.310
Yeah, this pile
is Luke's stuff.

28:08.326 --> 28:10.412
This pile is stuff that
reminds me of Luke.

28:10.428 --> 28:11.503
What's that pile?

28:11.517 --> 28:14.191
- Those are Babette's intimates.
- Of course.

28:14.208 --> 28:16.431
So, all these books
remind you of Luke?

28:16.447 --> 28:19.812
Yeah, those are books I gave
him to read, but he never did.

28:19.828 --> 28:21.730
Cormac McCarthy -- good call.

28:21.746 --> 28:23.252
"In cold blood" --
he would have loved that.

28:23.287 --> 28:24.523
Well, he'll never know now.

28:24.535 --> 28:27.282
You wanted him to read "Hammerhead
sharks -- demons of the deep"?

28:27.297 --> 28:28.711
He recommended that one for me.

28:28.726 --> 28:30.663
Pom-pom socks.

28:30.918 --> 28:33.033
Al's Pancake World
takeout menus.

28:33.046 --> 28:35.050
Hey, you're getting
rid of Bop It?

28:35.197 --> 28:37.021
And a spatula? Why?

28:37.038 --> 28:40.862
Oh, oh.
'Cause Luke used to make you breakfast.

28:40.876 --> 28:42.860
He did, but that's not
why I'm getting rid of it.

28:42.878 --> 28:46.133
Although now that you mention it,
the waffle iron has got to be dumped.

28:46.145 --> 28:46.900
We have a waffle iron?

28:46.938 --> 28:48.482
Don't get attached.
It's got to go.

28:48.496 --> 28:49.933
Spatula?

28:49.947 --> 28:51.622
We were having an
argument in the kitchen.

28:51.638 --> 28:54.332
And he said it was a fight, and I said
it wasn't really a fight, it was a spat.

28:54.368 --> 28:56.523
He said there was no difference
between a fight and a spat,

28:56.557 --> 28:58.733
and I said there was a huge
difference between a fight and a spat

28:58.768 --> 29:00.971
because a fight cannot be
diffused in the moment,

29:00.988 --> 29:05.163
but a spat can easily be diffused
with the use of a spatula.

29:05.176 --> 29:08.750
And I took the spatula out of the drawer, 
and I whacked him with it a little bit,

29:08.765 --> 29:12.092
and he started laughing,
and I started laughing, and...

29:12.108 --> 29:13.803
now I got to get rid of it.

29:13.905 --> 29:15.893
- Sad.
- I know.

29:15.908 --> 29:17.713
Okay, what happened
between you two?

29:17.726 --> 29:19.561
You have got to give
me something here,

29:19.576 --> 29:22.281
because you cannot just say that
you don't want to talk about it,

29:22.298 --> 29:24.443
because I saw Lukes today,
and I waved at him,

29:24.455 --> 29:25.690
and I did not know how to act.

29:25.708 --> 29:28.451
I mean, was it an "I hate you" wave,
or an "I'm sorry" wave,

29:28.467 --> 29:30.381
or "I can't believe you wanted
my mother to shave her head

29:30.415 --> 29:31.692
and become a moonie" wave.

29:31.708 --> 29:32.960
He doesn't want me
to shave my head.

29:32.998 --> 29:34.083
You shouldn't hate him.

29:34.098 --> 29:36.142
There's nothing to
be angry about.

29:36.155 --> 29:38.111
You knew we were having
problems, right?

29:38.128 --> 29:40.273
The whole April thing and
postponing the wedding.

29:40.288 --> 29:42.603
Finally, I got tired
of waiting for him,

29:42.618 --> 29:44.450
so I gave him an ultimatum.

29:44.468 --> 29:46.850
And he said no. So, that's it.

29:46.865 --> 29:49.882
It's over.
Here I am, making piles.

29:49.898 --> 29:52.923
The third stage of
grief is making piles.

29:55.627 --> 29:57.201
Steak or peas?

29:57.218 --> 29:58.620
No, no, no --
this is not my fault!

29:58.635 --> 30:00.260
This is all your fault,
Taylor, all of it!

30:00.298 --> 30:01.992
Lucas, I understand
why you're perturbed.

30:02.007 --> 30:03.491
Perturbed? Do I seem perturbed?

30:03.508 --> 30:06.532
I am so far past perturbed
that I couldn't look behind me

30:06.548 --> 30:08.032
and see perturbed
with a telescope.

30:08.048 --> 30:09.911
You never listen to
anybody, Taylor.

30:09.926 --> 30:12.710
You just barrel along and decide
what's best for everybody,

30:12.727 --> 30:13.883
consequences be damned.

30:13.897 --> 30:17.430
Now, I grant you the ceremony today
did not go entirely according to plan.

30:17.448 --> 30:19.832
According to plan?
There's a car in my diner --

30:19.846 --> 30:21.650
a freaking car, Taylor.

30:21.668 --> 30:25.530
A two-door 1965 Ford
Thunderbird in my diner.

30:25.548 --> 30:26.680
Actually, it's a '64.

30:26.695 --> 30:28.533
So, you do you think?
You want me to move it out or not?

30:28.568 --> 30:31.161
I would really advise waiting
until our insurance agents arrived.

30:31.166 --> 30:32.813
It's up to you, pal.
It's on your property.

30:32.848 --> 30:34.582
- I don't know yet!
- You could have some sympathy.

30:34.617 --> 30:37.693
After all, it's my car that crashed,
my most prized possession.

30:37.706 --> 30:39.872
I mean, the paint job alone
is gonna cost me a fortune,

30:39.907 --> 30:41.543
and who knows what other
damage has been done

30:41.577 --> 30:43.180
or what my insurance
will or won't cover?

30:43.216 --> 30:44.863
Well, maybe I'll come
back with a sledgehammer,

30:44.895 --> 30:46.413
and you can tell them
you totaled the thing.

30:46.448 --> 30:49.330
Luke, I would strongly advise
against any rash action

30:49.345 --> 30:52.063
that could lead to undue
and costly litigation.

30:52.076 --> 30:53.933
- How about now?
- Giant red spots.

30:53.945 --> 30:55.451
Nothing but giant red spots.

30:55.466 --> 30:56.780
How's it look
under there, Gypsy?

30:56.787 --> 30:58.412
Well, the car is fine.

30:58.425 --> 31:01.041
It definitely wasn't faulty
brakes that caused the accident.

31:01.055 --> 31:02.013
Kirk is just an idiot.

31:02.025 --> 31:04.031
Hey, I resent that.
Who was that?

31:04.045 --> 31:05.321
Damn giant red spots.

31:05.335 --> 31:06.393
What do you want
to do here, buddy?

31:06.428 --> 31:08.460
You want me to pull the car out or
you wanna wait for the insurance guy?

31:08.495 --> 31:10.131
I'm not sure what
I want to do yet.

31:10.147 --> 31:12.370
I need to know now.
I can't spend all day here.

31:12.388 --> 31:15.060
Either we move the car right now,
or I take off, you leave it in here,

31:15.097 --> 31:17.411
and wait for the insurance guys.
You got to decide.

31:17.427 --> 31:20.281
Look, do not pressure me, okay?
I do not like being pressured.

31:20.295 --> 31:22.143
It's not one or the other.
I need to think.

31:22.156 --> 31:25.150
Will you people just give
me some time to think?

31:28.195 --> 31:29.680
- Soothing.
- Very.

31:29.698 --> 31:32.142
- Zen.
- Thoreau, Walden Pond.

31:32.157 --> 31:34.643
- Oh, I have an idea.
- Huh?

31:35.877 --> 31:38.213
Maybe I should just go to Ikea.

31:42.465 --> 31:44.861
- I like it.
- Yeah?

31:44.877 --> 31:47.991
Maybe you can use it as the
basis for your redecorating.

31:48.008 --> 31:50.701
Use it as a jumping-off point.
Make everything kind of gray and shiny.

31:50.736 --> 31:52.503
Well, it doesn't remind
me of Luke at all.

31:52.516 --> 31:55.241
Well, that's my problem.
It doesn't remind me of Logan either.

31:55.257 --> 31:56.493
It's so frustrating.

31:56.506 --> 31:57.890
Why don't you just call him?

31:57.908 --> 32:00.821
I can't do that until I know what
this is, until I know what it means.

32:00.837 --> 32:02.751
See, this long distance
thing isn't working already.

32:02.786 --> 32:04.012
Rory, he just left.

32:04.027 --> 32:06.863
Exactly, and I'm already
completely confused.

32:06.875 --> 32:08.402
I mean,
I think we're still together,

32:08.415 --> 32:10.791
but that's what I thought last
time we spent time apart.

32:10.808 --> 32:13.202
I was 100% sure that we
were still together,

32:13.215 --> 32:15.861
and he was 100% sure
that we had broken up,

32:15.877 --> 32:17.902
and then he ended up sleeping
with those bridesmaids.

32:17.936 --> 32:19.662
What is it you guys agreed to?

32:19.677 --> 32:21.323
Well, that's just it.
Nothing, really.

32:21.335 --> 32:22.700
I mean,
it was early in the morning,

32:22.735 --> 32:24.931
and we hadn't had a chance
to decide on anything,

32:24.946 --> 32:26.661
and we hadn't had the talk.

32:26.677 --> 32:28.061
Now it's too late.

32:28.076 --> 32:29.580
He's thousands of miles away,

32:29.596 --> 32:32.463
and we talk on the phone,
but we don't really say anything.

32:32.476 --> 32:34.062
And he's leaving me rockets.

32:34.075 --> 32:37.001
Well, it's not too late.
He's been gone a day -- less than a day.

32:37.015 --> 32:38.073
You guys will figure it out.

32:38.105 --> 32:40.120
But it's hard on the phone, you know.
I can't see him.

32:40.155 --> 32:41.620
I can't read his expression.

32:41.635 --> 32:44.302
How am I ever supposed to know
what he's thinking or feeling?

32:44.317 --> 32:46.080
I mean,
his eyes always give him away.

32:46.096 --> 32:47.863
Logan has very expressive eyes.

32:47.875 --> 32:48.971
I've noticed.

32:48.988 --> 32:50.890
It's one of the things he and
Bette Davis have in common.

32:50.925 --> 32:54.013
And sometimes he'll smile at me,
and I can tell exactly how he's feeling,

32:54.027 --> 32:55.460
and now I can't.

32:55.477 --> 32:56.811
So go to London.

32:56.825 --> 32:58.391
- What?
- Go to London.

32:58.407 --> 32:59.872
Go be with him this summer.

32:59.888 --> 33:02.641
The two of you were supposed to go
traveling in Asia together anyway.

33:02.646 --> 33:04.531
You don't have any plans for the summer,
so go.

33:04.547 --> 33:06.611
I can't just go to London.

33:07.645 --> 33:08.863
- Can I?
- Why not?

33:08.877 --> 33:11.173
You two could have an amazing
summer together in London.

33:11.188 --> 33:12.780
Pick up the phone. Call him.

33:12.798 --> 33:14.890
I need to do some
more googling.

33:14.908 --> 33:16.592
I'm going to bed.

33:18.528 --> 33:21.772
- So Taylor's car is...
- In Luke's diner.

34:15.688 --> 34:17.891
- Hello.
- Hey, how you doing?

34:17.905 --> 34:19.023
Fine.

34:19.036 --> 34:20.981
I'm just checking in.

34:21.676 --> 34:23.933
Had a really great
time last night.

34:26.145 --> 34:28.911
Don't worry.
This is not a booty call.

34:29.338 --> 34:32.822
It can't be, 'cause you're not 18,
and it's not 1997.

34:32.835 --> 34:34.373
Are you doing anything
tomorrow night?

34:34.387 --> 34:36.241
'Cause I was thinking
maybe you could come over,

34:36.275 --> 34:38.340
and I could cook us some diner.

34:38.355 --> 34:39.652
Christopher.

34:39.665 --> 34:41.301
Lorelai.

34:42.358 --> 34:45.820
Let's not make more
out of it than it was.

34:45.835 --> 34:47.610
So, you're saying last
night was a booty call.

34:47.648 --> 34:50.222
I'm just saying,
I don't think it should happen again.

34:50.235 --> 34:51.632
Oh.

34:52.097 --> 34:53.792
Okay.

34:55.356 --> 34:57.600
Well, I'm here for you
if you need anything.

34:57.618 --> 34:58.813
You know that, right?

34:58.825 --> 35:01.500
I -- yeah, no --
I appreciate... that.

35:01.515 --> 35:03.910
Okay. I guess I'll
say good night.

35:03.928 --> 35:05.710
Yeah -- night.

35:06.386 --> 35:07.402
Okay.

35:12.116 --> 35:15.480
I got it, I got it.
He loved her so much

35:15.498 --> 35:18.632
he was willing to wait 40
years alone in space for her.

35:19.185 --> 35:22.241
I got it. The rocket, I get it.

35:22.256 --> 35:23.412
You do?

35:23.426 --> 35:25.912
Yes. I have been googling rockets,
you know.

35:25.926 --> 35:29.000
Rocket ships, rocket love,
rocket London, Logan rocket,

35:29.015 --> 35:32.543
and let me tell you, it has not always
been a pleasant journey. People are freaks.

35:32.555 --> 35:34.870
But then I found this blog,
rocket boy.

35:34.888 --> 35:36.282
- Rocket boy.
- Rocket boy.

35:36.297 --> 35:37.960
Knows a ton about rockets.
And as it turns out,

35:37.995 --> 35:40.422
he's got over 200
classic L.E.V.s.

35:40.437 --> 35:42.770
- L.E.V.s?
- Lunar Excursion Vehicles.

35:42.786 --> 35:44.931
So then he tells me that
he hosts this chat-room,

35:44.946 --> 35:47.282
and this is where
I get really lucky,

35:47.296 --> 35:50.250
because rocketchamp465
was just logging off,

35:50.267 --> 35:52.623
and I caught him,
and I described the rocket to him,

35:52.637 --> 35:55.812
and he recognized it from one of
these episodes of "The Twilight Zone."

35:55.827 --> 35:56.913
"The Twilight Zone."

35:56.925 --> 35:58.742
So I clicked on "The
Twilight Zone" website,

35:58.758 --> 36:01.250
and I found the episode,
and I got it!

36:01.268 --> 36:03.742
I still have no idea what
you're talking about.

36:03.756 --> 36:05.800
When Logan and I were
first going out,

36:05.817 --> 36:07.790
we were in the pool house
one night really late,

36:07.805 --> 36:09.060
and we were falling
asleep on the couch.

36:09.095 --> 36:10.000
Wa wa wa.

36:10.018 --> 36:11.220
- Mom.
- Sorry.

36:11.237 --> 36:13.041
- Chachi, right?
- Proud.

36:13.055 --> 36:15.621
- So, we were on the couch.
- Wa wa wa.

36:15.635 --> 36:18.552
And this episode of "The Twilight
Zone" came on -- "The Long Morrow."

36:18.566 --> 36:19.543
That's a bad title.

36:19.557 --> 36:21.142
- That's not the point.
- I'm just saying.

36:21.176 --> 36:24.922
So, there's this astronaut who was
supposed to go into space for 40 years,

36:24.937 --> 36:27.413
but right before he left,
he met this beautiful woman.

36:27.428 --> 36:29.550
But for those 40 years that
he was going to be in space,

36:29.586 --> 36:31.772
he was going to be in
suspended animation.

36:31.785 --> 36:33.451
So when he came back to earth,

36:33.466 --> 36:34.921
he was going to
be really young,

36:34.936 --> 36:36.761
but she would be really old.

36:36.776 --> 36:39.873
So he goes into space,
and when he does come back,

36:39.887 --> 36:41.851
the woman is still
young and beautiful

36:41.868 --> 36:45.481
because she put herself in
suspended animation to wait for him,

36:45.495 --> 36:47.021
but he's really, really old

36:47.035 --> 36:49.573
because he took himself
out of suspended animation

36:49.587 --> 36:51.172
so he could be old with her.

36:51.188 --> 36:52.231
How depressing.

36:52.247 --> 36:55.293
He spent 40 years alone in
space just waiting to see her,

36:55.308 --> 36:57.750
and he was willing to come
back as an 80-year-old man,

36:57.768 --> 36:59.770
giving up almost
his entire life

36:59.788 --> 37:01.922
just to spend those last
few years with her.

37:01.935 --> 37:04.192
Now, are you aware when you're
in suspended animation,

37:04.207 --> 37:05.773
or is it just like
a really long nap?

37:05.786 --> 37:10.093
Shush! The point is, that this is Logan's 
favorite episode of "The Twilight Zone."

37:10.106 --> 37:12.032
And when we watched
it together,

37:12.045 --> 37:14.793
he said, "that's true love."

37:14.806 --> 37:16.490
That's true love!

37:16.507 --> 37:19.183
This is the most romantic
gift I've ever been given.

37:19.195 --> 37:21.651
I mean, I have to call him.
I'm going to London.

37:21.665 --> 37:22.923
I am going to London.

37:22.936 --> 37:24.013
Yay!

37:24.027 --> 37:26.243
But -- wait,
are you gonna be okay while I'm gone?

37:26.256 --> 37:28.572
Yes, I'll be fine.

37:28.587 --> 37:31.501
Okay, but we're going shopping
for linens before I go.

37:34.175 --> 37:35.500
- Hello?
- Hey!

37:35.516 --> 37:36.390
Hey!

37:36.408 --> 37:38.451
I'm sorry for calling so early.
Did I wake you?

37:38.466 --> 37:40.202
I'm actually at the office.

37:40.216 --> 37:41.121
On a dare?

37:41.138 --> 37:43.322
It's my first day, so I'm trying 
to make a good impression.

37:43.358 --> 37:45.363
So you're, like,
dressed and everything?

37:45.378 --> 37:47.522
New suit, new shoes,
even brushed my hair.

37:47.538 --> 37:49.742
How's the office? Is it fabulous?
Do you have a window?

37:49.755 --> 37:51.693
I wouldn't say it's fabulous,
but I do have a window.

37:51.728 --> 37:52.960
Can you see the queen?

37:52.975 --> 37:54.932
Actually, my window looks
out on Piccadilly Circus.

37:54.966 --> 37:56.550
So, you can just see
elephants and clowns

37:56.585 --> 37:58.283
walking past your
building all day long?

37:58.298 --> 37:59.892
- That must be nice.
- It's brilliant.

37:59.908 --> 38:02.062
Brilliant? Oh, my god.
You're turning british.

38:02.075 --> 38:03.543
Do you have a secretary
named Moneypenny?

38:03.577 --> 38:05.313
My secretary's name is Steven.

38:05.328 --> 38:07.930
- Steven Moneypenny?
- Yes.

38:07.945 --> 38:11.992
So... I just wanted to
thank you for the rocket.

38:12.006 --> 38:13.282
You already thanked me.

38:13.297 --> 38:15.553
Oh, I know, I did,
but I wanted to do it again,

38:15.568 --> 38:19.403
because I'm not sure I conveyed how much
I loved it in our last conversation.

38:19.416 --> 38:21.943
I really, really loved it.

38:21.956 --> 38:23.252
I'm glad.

38:23.266 --> 38:25.932
I can't wait to come see you, Logan.
I can't wait.

38:25.948 --> 38:27.850
- I already got you a ticket.
- You're kidding.

38:27.866 --> 38:30.711
I got it right here. I was gonna fedex
it to you. You'll have it by tomorrow.

38:30.745 --> 38:31.822
Oh, my god!

38:31.837 --> 38:34.653
Yeah, so tell your mom you're
not gonna be home for Christmas.

38:34.818 --> 38:35.881
Christmas?

38:35.897 --> 38:37.182
Two weeks, just you and me.

38:37.197 --> 38:38.721
I already cleared it with my dad.
It's gonna be amazing.

38:38.755 --> 38:40.693
I'm still playing around with the
itinerary, but how do you feel about

38:40.725 --> 38:42.383
- London, Paris, and Rome?
- Wow.

38:42.395 --> 38:44.823
I figured we'd do a week in London,
then quick train ride,

38:44.835 --> 38:46.731
and we do three days in Paris,
and we finish our trip

38:46.767 --> 38:48.320
with a four-day
sojourn in Rome.

38:48.335 --> 38:49.910
We still have enough time
for one last night in London

38:49.945 --> 38:50.971
before you have
to fly back home.

38:51.005 --> 38:53.551
Logan, that sounds amazing.

38:53.566 --> 38:55.220
Oh, hey, I should take off.

38:55.235 --> 38:56.813
My first staff meeting.
They're waving me in.

38:56.848 --> 38:58.261
Oh, okay, good luck.

38:58.275 --> 39:00.583
- Thanks, cheers.
- Cheers.

39:25.498 --> 39:29.162
Uh... a car crashed into
my diner yesterday.

39:29.175 --> 39:31.561
There's a giant hole
where my wall used to be.

39:31.575 --> 39:34.883
It's gonna take a
couple of weeks to fix.

39:36.068 --> 39:38.941
It's a disaster,
but I don't care.

39:38.958 --> 39:41.110
I mean, I care, but...

39:42.297 --> 39:44.881
You know what, no. I really --

39:44.895 --> 39:46.550
I don't care.

39:48.168 --> 39:49.730
It's like it's not
even real to me.

39:49.747 --> 39:53.553
It's like my life
isn't even real to me

39:53.568 --> 39:56.213
unless you're there,
and you're in it,

39:56.228 --> 39:58.280
and I'm sharing it with you.

39:58.316 --> 40:00.852
And, uh,
I don't know what I was waiting for,

40:00.865 --> 40:02.853
and I don't know what I was scared of,
but I'm not.

40:02.885 --> 40:05.753
I'm not scared, and I'm not waiting.
I'm here.

40:05.765 --> 40:07.980
- Luke.
- No, don't say anything.

40:07.998 --> 40:11.860
I've got a tank full of gas,
and Maryland is only 200 miles away,

40:11.878 --> 40:14.862
and I've made us some reservations
at a couple of bed-and-breakfasts.

40:14.877 --> 40:17.820
If you don't want to do the
Maryland thing, we don't have to.

40:17.837 --> 40:19.683
I heard you say
"Maryland" the other day.

40:19.695 --> 40:22.643
I don't know whether you were serious.
I'm just trying to cover my bases here.

40:22.675 --> 40:24.573
- Luke --
- I also packed some camping equipment

40:24.587 --> 40:28.050
so we can head to Vermont or Maine and,
you know,

40:28.068 --> 40:31.980
check into a cabin for a week,
you know, like a little honeymoon thing.

40:31.998 --> 40:35.961
But maybe that's a little
too rustic for your taste.

40:35.976 --> 40:39.070
Or we could drive
to Atlantic City

40:39.087 --> 40:42.303
or even Las Vegas if you want to
make a real road trip out of it.

40:42.315 --> 40:43.612
Luke, stop.

40:43.626 --> 40:46.950
I also did some research,
and we can also apparently

40:46.965 --> 40:49.092
use a sea captain, if you want.

40:49.108 --> 40:51.671
I'm not sure how big the boat
has to be for it to be legal,

40:51.688 --> 40:54.661
but we can head to the coast,
and we can knock on some doors,

40:54.677 --> 40:56.831
you know, boat doors.

40:56.847 --> 40:59.603
Yeah, that's probably not
the most sensible way.

40:59.618 --> 41:01.872
- Just stop.
- But, no, you were right.

41:01.887 --> 41:05.090
Okay. I need to be faster. I need to
move faster, I need to think faster.

41:05.107 --> 41:07.882
And, well, here I am.

41:09.845 --> 41:11.071
It's over.

41:11.086 --> 41:12.941
No, you can't say that.

41:12.955 --> 41:15.461
You can't just say that it's over.
It's not over.

41:15.477 --> 41:18.671
You can't just decide that it's over.
I'm in this, too, you know.

41:18.685 --> 41:22.183
I'm not gonna let it be over.
You said, "be ready now or never."

41:22.198 --> 41:23.200
I'm ready now.

41:23.218 --> 41:24.471
- Luke.
- Let's go.

41:24.486 --> 41:26.993
Let's do this.
Let's get married right now.

41:27.006 --> 41:28.542
Let's go.

41:29.175 --> 41:31.531
I slept with Christopher.

41:52.175 --> 41:55.931
