WEBVTT

00:07.888 --> 00:09.629
"MELISSA AND JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:09.630 --> 00:11.511
I SAW HIM GETTING OUT
OF HIS CAR, HURRY.

00:11.512 --> 00:13.803
RELAX, ALL RIGHT? HE'S A
MINISTER, HE'S NOT THE POPE.

00:13.804 --> 00:15.805
NO, HE'S NOT JUST A MINISTER.

00:15.806 --> 00:17.637
HE'S THE ONLY MINISTER WE
COULD AGREE ON TO MARRY US.

00:17.638 --> 00:19.139
I DON'T WANT HIM TO
KNOW WE WERE JUST...

00:19.140 --> 00:21.401
GETTING ALL FREAKY DEAKY?

00:21.402 --> 00:22.562
- YES. ( groans )
- ( doorbell rings )

00:22.563 --> 00:23.693
YOU KNOW, I KNEW WE
SHOULD HAVE BEEN

00:23.694 --> 00:25.275
PREPARING FOR OUR
INTERVIEW, INSTEAD OF...

00:25.276 --> 00:27.357
WELL, YOU KNOW. YOU WERE THERE.

00:27.358 --> 00:29.989
HONEY, LISTEN, REVEREND
MATTHEWS JUST WANTS TO MEET US

00:29.990 --> 00:32.202
SO HE CAN, YOU KNOW, GET TO
KNOW US BEFORE THE CEREMONY.

00:32.203 --> 00:33.953
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL. IT'S REALLY
MORE OF JUST A FORMALITY.

00:33.954 --> 00:34.954
WE HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE.

00:34.955 --> 00:36.456
- NOTHING?
- NO.

00:36.457 --> 00:37.658
WHAT? OH!

00:40.461 --> 00:42.122
GOOD MORNING, HAPPY COUPLE.

00:42.123 --> 00:43.123
UH... ( chuckles )

00:43.124 --> 00:44.664
BOY... ( sniffs )

00:44.665 --> 00:46.547
SMELLS LIKE YOU TWO
HAVE BEEN BUSY...

00:47.968 --> 00:50.800
UM, MAKING BREAKFAST.

00:50.801 --> 00:53.343
YEAH, I COULD SMELL THE
BACON AND EGGS FROM HERE.

00:53.344 --> 00:55.765
- YES, BACON...
- AND EGGS.

00:55.766 --> 00:57.557
YEAH, 'CAUSE YOU DON'T WANNA
FORGET ABOUT THE EGGS.

00:57.558 --> 00:59.980
YOU TWO JUST HAD
SEX, DIDN'T YOU?

01:02.273 --> 01:03.484
HE'S GOOD.

01:26.297 --> 01:30.089
I'D LIKE TO START WITH A
QUESTION THAT I ASK ALL COUPLES:

01:30.090 --> 01:33.553
CAN YOU DO BETTER?

01:33.554 --> 01:36.426
- WHAT? NO.
- WHAT? NO, OF COURSE NOT.

01:36.427 --> 01:39.980
GOOD ANSWER. I LIKE TO WEED
OUT THE LOSERS RIGHT AWAY.

01:41.982 --> 01:44.604
I HOLD THE RECORD FOR
OFFICIATING THE HIGHEST RATE

01:44.605 --> 01:46.436
OF SUCCESSFUL MARRIAGES...

01:46.437 --> 01:49.068
IN OHIO.

01:49.069 --> 01:50.320
SO, PLEASE,

01:50.321 --> 01:52.282
DON'T MESS IT UP, OKAY?

01:52.283 --> 01:54.113
OH, YOU DON'T GAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT US, SIR.

01:54.114 --> 01:56.736
- YEAH, WE KNOW WE BELONG TOGETHER.
- REALLY?

01:56.737 --> 01:58.369
WAS IT LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT?

02:00.080 --> 02:02.082
NOT EXACTLY.

02:04.745 --> 02:07.046
OH, GROSS!

02:07.047 --> 02:09.048
( exasperated sigh )

02:09.049 --> 02:10.510
I WAS EXPECTING MY DATE.

02:10.511 --> 02:12.172
I'LL BE QUICK.

02:12.173 --> 02:13.923
I WAS A JACKASS
DOWN AT CITY HALL,

02:13.924 --> 02:15.054
AND I NEVER SHOULD HAVE
CRASHED YOUR MEETING

02:15.055 --> 02:16.256
ASKING WHERE YOUR
BROTHER-IN-LAW WAS.

02:16.257 --> 02:18.137
THAT WAS WRONG, AND I
JUST WANTED TO COME HERE

02:18.138 --> 02:19.890
AND SAY THAT I'M SORRY.

02:21.061 --> 02:22.522
( shouts ) BOLIVIA!

02:22.523 --> 02:25.024
LEWIS IS IN BOLIVIA, ISN'T HE?
YOU JUST FLINCHED.

02:25.025 --> 02:27.026
I FLINCHED BECAUSE YOU
SHOUTED, "BOLIVIA."

02:27.027 --> 02:28.858
OKAY, PEOPLE IN
BOLIVIA FLINCHED.

02:28.859 --> 02:30.570
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHERE THE HELL HE IS!

02:30.571 --> 02:31.821
NOW GET LOST AND LEAVE ME ALONE!

02:31.822 --> 02:33.072
HI, GRIFFIN, HEY.

02:33.073 --> 02:34.444
DON'T YOU LOOK NICE AND...
( sniffs )

02:34.445 --> 02:36.075
SMELL HANDSOME?

02:36.076 --> 02:37.867
- WHO'S THIS GUY?
- AH, NO GUY.

02:37.868 --> 02:40.490
I'M A VIC...

02:40.491 --> 02:42.081
YOU EVER WORK WITH KIDS?

02:42.082 --> 02:43.082
ARE YOU KIDDING? RIGHT
OUT OF COLLEGE,

02:43.083 --> 02:44.123
I RAN A YOUTH CENTER DOWNTOWN.

02:44.124 --> 02:45.625
I WAS IN CHARGE OF 50 TEENAGERS.

02:45.626 --> 02:47.707
COOKED THEM MEALS, HELPED
THEM WITH THEIR HOMEWORK.

02:47.708 --> 02:50.500
I WAS CHARLES-FRIGGIN'-IN
CHARGE.

02:50.501 --> 02:52.922
YEAH, YOU'RE PERFECT.

02:52.923 --> 02:54.754
THERE'S JUST ONE LITTLE DETAIL:

02:54.755 --> 02:55.966
I DON'T REALLY LIKE YOU.

02:57.057 --> 02:58.798
( both laugh nervously )

02:58.799 --> 03:01.180
SO, UM, BASICALLY,

03:01.181 --> 03:03.103
YOU TWO CAN'T STAND EACH OTHER?

03:04.975 --> 03:06.476
WELL, YOU KNOW, JUST...

03:06.477 --> 03:07.977
JUST FOR THE FIRST
COUPLE OF YEARS.

03:07.978 --> 03:10.480
YEAH, WE LOVE EACH OTHER NOW.

03:10.481 --> 03:12.442
OKAY, NEXT QUESTION.

03:12.443 --> 03:15.074
HOW DO YOU RESOLVE CONFLICT?

03:15.075 --> 03:16.486
VERY LOUDLY.

03:16.487 --> 03:19.078
WHAT HE MEANS IS WE
KINDA FIGHT A LOT.

03:19.079 --> 03:21.120
ONE OF US IS NOT REALLY
TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY.

03:21.121 --> 03:22.492
- OH, AND THAT'S ME?
- YEAH, THAT'S YOU.

03:22.493 --> 03:23.623
NOW STAND UP. WE'RE GONNA DANCE.

03:23.624 --> 03:25.204
- LET'S GO.
- WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA.

03:25.205 --> 03:27.086
I THINK I KNOW WHAT
THIS IS ABOUT:

03:27.087 --> 03:28.498
- CONTROL.
- OH MY...

03:28.499 --> 03:30.380
YEAH, YOU LIVE IN MY
HOUSE, YOU WORK FOR ME.

03:30.381 --> 03:32.422
UH, TECHNICALLY, I AM FREELANCE.

03:32.423 --> 03:34.294
AH, BUP BUP BUP. LOOK...

03:34.295 --> 03:36.466
YOU PUT UP WITH A LOT, AND THE ONE
TIME YOU'RE PUT IN A POSITION WHERE

03:36.467 --> 03:39.138
YOU ACTUALLY KNOW SOMETHING, YOU
JUST WANNA RUN THE WHOLE SHOW.

03:39.139 --> 03:41.641
OR MAYBE IT'S ABOUT SOMEONE WHO LIKES
TO CALL THE SHOTS AT EVERYTHING,

03:41.642 --> 03:44.474
INCLUDING THE EXACT COLOR OF
STRIPES IN OUR TOOTHPASTE!

03:44.475 --> 03:46.055
AND NOW YOU'RE INVOLVED
IN A SITUATION

03:46.056 --> 03:47.477
WHERE SOMEBODY ACTUALLY KNOWS A
LITTLE BIT MORE THAN YOU DO!

03:47.478 --> 03:49.108
HEY, STRIPES ARE
IMPORTANT, OKAY?

03:49.109 --> 03:51.111
THE GREEN FRESHENS AND
THE WHITE DAZZLES.

03:53.113 --> 03:55.234
- CONTROL FREAK!
- POWER MAD DANCE MASTER!

03:55.235 --> 03:57.697
- GOOD LOOK WITH THE DANCE, BABY.
- GOOD LUCK WITH THE EGO!

03:57.698 --> 03:59.068
WE CAN'T GO OUT ON
A ROMANTIC DATE.

03:59.069 --> 04:00.410
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE
OF A HUGE FIGHT.

04:00.411 --> 04:01.991
WE ARE?

04:01.992 --> 04:03.202
YOU DIDN'T KNOW?

04:03.203 --> 04:04.704
NOBODY TOLD ME!

04:04.705 --> 04:06.956
CHARLOTTE SAID THAT NOBODY
CAN RELAX AROUND US,

04:06.957 --> 04:08.748
BECAUSE OF ALL OF THE
LOUD DISAGREEING.

04:08.749 --> 04:10.710
NOBODY CAN RELAX AROUND US?!
THAT'S RIDIC...

04:10.711 --> 04:12.211
I... I AM INSANELY RELAXING.

04:12.212 --> 04:14.964
I'M LIKE XANAX IN HUMAN FORM!

04:14.965 --> 04:16.255
WELL, YOU ARE A PILL.

04:16.256 --> 04:18.047
I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU
SPILLED THE BEANS

04:18.048 --> 04:20.139
TO GILLIAN ABOUT NATE
WANTING TO DUMP HER!

04:20.140 --> 04:22.051
YOU GAVE ME THE BEANS.
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO?

04:22.052 --> 04:23.383
I DON'T KNOW! CLENCH...

04:23.384 --> 04:27.096
LIKE A DRUG MULE ON A
PLANE FROM COLUMBIA!

04:27.097 --> 04:29.228
THIS IS NICE. WE SHOULD DO
LABELS LIKE THIS IN OUR HOUSE.

04:29.229 --> 04:32.231
UM, FOR INSTANCE, I
WOULD BE "BEST HAIR,"

04:32.232 --> 04:35.735
"BEST AUNT" AND
"BEST PERSONALITY."

04:35.736 --> 04:37.857
HA! WHAT, ON OPPOSITE DAY?

04:37.858 --> 04:39.158
YEAH, WELL, YOU WOULD
GET "MOST MATURE."

04:39.159 --> 04:41.030
NOT!

04:41.031 --> 04:43.993
RIGHT AFTER YOU GOT "LEAST CONSISTENT
ABOUT EVERYTHING YOU EVER SAY."

04:43.994 --> 04:45.034
EH, MEH MEH MEH MEH...

04:45.035 --> 04:46.456
RYDER, DO YOU WANNA GO UPSTAIRS?

04:46.457 --> 04:48.328
I CANNOT DEAL WITH ONE
OF THESE RIGHT NOW.

04:48.329 --> 04:50.119
ME, EITHER.

04:50.120 --> 04:51.501
"MEH MEH MEH MEH."
WHAT WAS THAT?

04:51.502 --> 04:52.792
WHAT ARE YOU, A
ROADRUNNER OR SOMETHING?

04:52.793 --> 04:54.544
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU WOULD
GET "MOST ANNOYING."

04:54.545 --> 04:56.215
- OH, "MOST ANNOYING"?
- YEAH, "MOST ANNOYING"...

04:56.216 --> 04:57.837
REALLY? OKAY. WELL, FINE,
I LEARNED FROM THE BEST.

04:57.838 --> 04:59.219
AND "MOST BALD."

05:01.091 --> 05:02.091
YIKES!

05:02.092 --> 05:04.684
BOY, ALL THIS COMBUSTION

05:04.685 --> 05:07.096
COULD WRECK MY SUCCESS RATE.

05:07.097 --> 05:08.888
COME ON, REVEREND, IT'S NOT
LIKE THIS LITTLE QUIZ IS GONNA,

05:08.889 --> 05:10.390
YOU KNOW, KEEP YOU
FROM MARRYING US.

05:10.391 --> 05:12.852
WELL, ACTUALLY, IT COULD.

05:12.853 --> 05:14.063
( both chuckle )

05:14.064 --> 05:16.856
IT'S NOT A JOKE, FRIENDS.

05:16.857 --> 05:18.938
IF YOU FAIL THIS TEST,
I'M NOT MARRYING YOU.

05:18.939 --> 05:20.490
WHAT DID YOU THINK THIS WAS,

05:20.491 --> 05:22.031
JUST A FORMALITY?

05:22.032 --> 05:23.202
DID YOU HEAR THAT, JOE?

05:23.203 --> 05:25.786
IT'S NOT JUST A FORMALITY.

05:32.122 --> 05:34.293
WHAT IF HE DECIDES
NOT TO MARRY US?

05:34.294 --> 05:35.835
OUR WEDDING IS NEXT WEEK.

05:35.836 --> 05:38.047
OKAY, WELL, LOOK, WE'RE JUST
GONNA HAVE TO TAKE A MOMENT

05:38.048 --> 05:39.549
AND REALLY THINK
ABOUT WHAT WE SAY

05:39.550 --> 05:41.220
BEFORE WE JUST SAY THE FIRST
THING THAT POPS INTO OUR HEADS.

05:41.221 --> 05:42.762
YOU MEAN, LIE?

05:42.763 --> 05:45.174
WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF THAT?

05:45.175 --> 05:47.347
YES, WE'RE DONE WITH THE TRUTH.
THE TRUTH IS NOT HELPING.

05:49.430 --> 05:50.470
( coughs )

05:50.471 --> 05:52.311
OH, WOW!

05:52.312 --> 05:54.313
BOY, THAT'S GOOD COFFEE.

05:54.314 --> 05:58.978
I'LL BE HITTING THE OL' PORCELAIN
WISHING WELL IN NO TIME.

05:58.979 --> 06:00.780
YEP, IT'S DELICIOUS, ISN'T IT?

06:00.781 --> 06:05.034
THAT'S ALL JOE'S WORK. MY SWEET,
WONDERFUL, INCREDIBLE JOE.

06:05.035 --> 06:07.447
WELL, SURELY YOU DON'T
ALWAYS FEEL THAT WAY.

06:07.448 --> 06:09.158
ISN'T THERE ANYTHING YOU FIND

06:09.159 --> 06:11.161
ANNOYING ABOUT JOE?

06:13.373 --> 06:14.794
OKAY, BURKE, I DON'T
ASK FOR MUCH.

06:14.795 --> 06:16.375
IT'D JUST BE SO NICE
AFTER I WORK OUT

06:16.376 --> 06:19.378
IF I CAN MAYBE GET ONE,
TWO GALLONS OF HOT WATER.

06:19.379 --> 06:22.131

06:22.132 --> 06:23.713

06:23.714 --> 06:25.805
FINE, I'LL CALL HER FOR YOU,

06:25.806 --> 06:28.428
BUT I PREDICT THIS WHOLE THING
IS GONNA BLOW UP IN YOUR FACE.

06:28.429 --> 06:30.309
I MEAN, SHE MAY NOT EVEN
BE INTERESTED IN YOU.

06:30.310 --> 06:32.722
ARE YOU KIDDING? SHE...

SAW ME.

06:35.225 --> 06:37.276

THERE TO GET IT,

06:43.864 --> 06:45.114

OF INTERESTING IDEAS

DON'T YOU WANT HAPPINESS?

I JUST WANT THIS
PIERCING PAIN TO STOP.

08:12.613 --> 08:13.913
- OH NO.
- ( mimics explosion )

08:13.914 --> 08:16.075
I DON'T KNOW HOW PEOPLE...

08:16.076 --> 08:17.667
CAN BE FRIENDS WITH YOU.
I MEAN, I DON'T...

08:17.668 --> 08:20.169
( stammering ) I DON'T...

08:20.170 --> 08:21.420
I DON'T SEE THE APPEAL.

08:21.421 --> 08:23.423
STILL NOT SEEING IT.

08:29.970 --> 08:32.592
NOTHING ANNOYING COMES TO MIND.

08:32.593 --> 08:36.015
WELL, SEEMS LIKE YOU TWO WERE
LUCKY TO FIND EACH OTHER.

08:36.016 --> 08:39.098
UH, WERE THERE OTHER
RELATIONSHIPS ALONG THE WAY?

08:39.099 --> 08:41.901
YOU DON'T NEED A NUMBER, DO YOU?

08:41.902 --> 08:43.693
( chuckles ) OF COURSE HE
DOESN'T NEED A NUMBER.

08:43.694 --> 08:45.314
OH, OKAY.

08:45.315 --> 08:46.646
RIGHT?

08:46.647 --> 08:48.067
LET'S MAKE A BABY!

08:48.068 --> 08:49.860
RIGHT HERE ON OUR LUCKY COUCH!

08:51.201 --> 08:54.033
OOH. ( giggles )

08:54.034 --> 08:57.206
IT'S JUST NOT A GOOD IDEA TO DATE
SOMEBODY THAT MUCH YOUNGER THAN YOU.

08:57.207 --> 08:59.248
- HEY, JOE!
- HEY!

08:59.249 --> 09:01.832
IT'S LIKE CHRISTMAS.
HOT, SEXY CHRISTMAS.

09:03.293 --> 09:06.425
AND I AM READY TO
UNWRAP MY GIFT.

09:06.426 --> 09:09.088
ME TOO, 'CAUSE I'VE BEEN
A GOOD GIRL THIS YEAR.

09:09.089 --> 09:10.469
WE'RE OVER, JOE LONGO!

09:10.470 --> 09:13.222
WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT, HEY!

09:13.223 --> 09:15.304
WHEN THE BATTER STARTS TO BUBBLE,
YOU GO UNDER IT LIKE THIS

09:15.305 --> 09:16.806
AND JUST FLIP IT OVER.

09:16.807 --> 09:19.308
( Russian accent ) YOU ARE SO
GOOD AT FLIPPING THINGS OVER.

09:19.309 --> 09:21.230
( laughs )

09:21.231 --> 09:23.392
GETTING A LITTLE TEXT
MESSAGE FROM YOUR, UM...

09:23.393 --> 09:24.604
SNEAKY, SECRET BOYFRIEND?

09:24.605 --> 09:25.895
NO.

09:25.896 --> 09:28.278
A TEXT MESSAGE HAS WORDS.

09:30.110 --> 09:32.361
WE ARE NOT PARTNERS-PARTNERS.
OKAY, WE ARE... ( chuckles )

09:32.362 --> 09:34.573
WE ARE PARTNER-SILENT PARTNER,

09:34.574 --> 09:37.156
- SO, SHH.
- BUT I...

09:37.157 --> 09:38.828
AH AH AH! I JUST
SAID SILENT PARTNER.

09:38.829 --> 09:41.791
OKAY, HERE, I REFER
YOU TO MY PROSPECTUS.

09:41.792 --> 09:44.254
LET ME REFER YOU TO MY CHECK.

09:45.626 --> 09:47.086
BESIDES, I DON'T
REALLY DO SILENT.

09:47.087 --> 09:48.587
ASK ANY OF MY OTHER PARTNERS,

09:48.588 --> 09:50.590
I MAKE A LOT OF NOISE.

09:52.172 --> 09:54.263
YOU KNOW, WE REALLY DIDN'T
DATE THAT MUCH BEFORE WE MET.

09:54.264 --> 09:57.216
YEAH, WE WERE PRETTY MUCH
VIRGINS UNTIL WE GOT TOGETHER.

09:57.217 --> 09:58.267
UH-HUH.

09:58.268 --> 10:00.269
YOU KNOW, FOR THIS TO WORK,

10:00.270 --> 10:02.852
YOU HAVE TO BE TOTALLY HONEST.

10:02.853 --> 10:04.313
OH, WE ARE.

10:04.314 --> 10:06.225
WE NEVER LIE.

10:06.226 --> 10:08.228
I... I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW.

10:09.820 --> 10:12.231
I TEXTED LENNOX THAT I
HAD A BIG SURPRISE.

10:12.232 --> 10:14.864
YOU REMEMBER THAT GREEN DAY CONCERT
THAT SOLD OUT IN SIX MINUTES?

10:14.865 --> 10:16.736
WELL, GUESS WHO
SCORED TWO TICKETS.

10:16.737 --> 10:18.577
FLOOR SEATS? HOW DID
YOU SWING THAT?

10:18.578 --> 10:20.199
WHAT? I'M A CITY COUNCILWOMAN.

10:20.200 --> 10:22.411
OKAY? I'M A VERY
IMPORTANT PERSON.

10:22.412 --> 10:24.294
ALL RIGHT, I'M A
SEMI-IMPORTANT PERSON.

10:25.295 --> 10:27.127
FINE, I WON THEM ON THE RADIO.

10:28.418 --> 10:30.379
ALL RIGHT, ONE OF MY INTERNS
WON THEM ON THE RADIO

10:30.380 --> 10:32.011
AND SHE GAVE THEM TO ME.

10:32.012 --> 10:33.553
ALL RIGHT, I TOOK THEM FROM HER!

10:34.755 --> 10:36.757
( speaking Japanese )

10:45.686 --> 10:46.646
WHAT'D HE SAY?

10:46.647 --> 10:48.397
UM...

10:48.398 --> 10:49.608
HE SAID THAT, HE, UH,

10:49.609 --> 10:52.982
ADMIRES YOUR CHOICE
OF CHAMPAGNE TONIGHT.

10:52.983 --> 10:55.155
ONLY THE BEST FOR MY
FRIEND FROM JAPAN.

10:56.406 --> 10:58.408
( speaking Japanese )

11:06.086 --> 11:07.837
BUT, YOU KNOW, I SHOULD
PROBABLY GET HOME TOO.

11:07.838 --> 11:11.340
I'M STUFFED. I'M ALWAYS
TIRED AFTER A BIG MEAL.

11:11.341 --> 11:14.254
( speaking Japanese )

11:25.265 --> 11:27.146
( speaks Japanese )

11:27.147 --> 11:28.068
WHAT'S GERI?

11:28.069 --> 11:29.688
"STUFFED," "FULL."

11:29.689 --> 11:30.900
YES, GERI.

11:30.901 --> 11:33.153
MUCHO MUCHO GERI.

11:34.524 --> 11:36.485
I MEANT NEWS ABOUT
YOUR FRIEND JUNIOR.

11:36.486 --> 11:38.447
- GEORGE?
- NO, JUNIOR.

11:38.448 --> 11:40.659
AS IN, SEVERAL
YEARS YOUR JUNIOR.

11:40.660 --> 11:42.952
OKAY, LOOK, I KNOW HE'S
LITTLE YOUNG FOR ME...

11:42.953 --> 11:44.283
HE'S 24, BURKE. HE TOLD ME.

11:44.284 --> 11:45.664
SERIOUSLY?

11:45.665 --> 11:46.665
YEAH.

11:46.666 --> 11:47.666
THAT'S A PRETTY BIG AGE GAP.

11:47.667 --> 11:50.880
WELL, IT'S ONLY FOUR YEARS.

11:50.881 --> 11:52.381
HOW DO YOU FIGURE THAT?

11:52.382 --> 11:55.134
I TOLD HIM I WAS 28.

11:55.135 --> 11:57.096
YOU'RE NOT 28.

11:57.097 --> 11:58.297
AGE IS JUST A NUMBER.

11:58.298 --> 12:00.140
YEAH, WHEN YOU LIE ABOUT IT.

12:01.391 --> 12:03.602
LYING GOES TOTALLY
AGAINST OUR NATURE.

12:03.603 --> 12:05.014
( chuckling ) YEAH...

12:05.015 --> 12:06.015
UH-HUH.

12:06.016 --> 12:08.808
ARE YOU EVER INSULTING OR SNARKY

12:08.809 --> 12:09.809
TO EACH OTHER?

12:09.810 --> 12:11.440
Both: NO.

12:11.441 --> 12:14.443
NO, WE ALWAYS TREAT EACH OTHER
WITH THE UTMOST RESPECT...

12:14.444 --> 12:15.655
ALL THE TIME.

12:17.237 --> 12:20.199
PERSONAL QUESTION: DID YOUR
HAIR GET SICK OF YOU AND LEAVE?

12:20.200 --> 12:22.241
THIS IS A CHOICE!

12:22.242 --> 12:23.572
YES, WE KNOW. WHEN YOU
GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL,

12:23.573 --> 12:25.705
THEY RETIRED YOUR THONG.

12:27.287 --> 12:29.668
- JOE!
- YEAH, WHAT'S UP?

12:29.669 --> 12:31.290
NICE OUTFIT.

12:31.291 --> 12:34.044
SO, DO YOU DO THE "Y," THE
"M," THE "C" OR THE "A"?

12:39.219 --> 12:40.339
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

12:40.340 --> 12:41.550
THERE, HA!

12:41.551 --> 12:43.973
YOU'RE MR. CLEAN. LET'S GO.

12:43.974 --> 12:45.144
OH MY GOSH.

12:45.145 --> 12:46.185
OH MY GOD!

12:46.186 --> 12:48.227
OH, I WANNA KEEP THIS.

12:48.228 --> 12:50.099
AND THIS. AND THIS!

12:50.100 --> 12:51.981
WAIT A MINUTE. YOU'RE NEVER
GONNA WEAR ANY OF THOSE.

12:51.982 --> 12:54.814
BUT I STILL WANT THEM.
THEY'RE LIKE MUSEUM PIECES.

12:54.815 --> 12:57.196
WHAT MUSEUM? THE,
UH, SLUT-SONIAN?

12:57.197 --> 12:59.989
( Ryder laughs )

12:59.990 --> 13:01.780
SO HOW ABOUT YOU?
WHAT'S THE, UH...

13:01.781 --> 13:04.163
MOST DEGRADING THING YOU
EVER DID FOR MONEY?

13:04.164 --> 13:05.905
( clicks tongue )

13:05.906 --> 13:08.247
BY FAR, THIS.

13:08.248 --> 13:10.870
NO, SERIOUSLY. WHAT'S THE WACKIEST
THING YOU EVER DID FOR THE CASH?

13:10.871 --> 13:12.711
YOU KNOW, YOU EVER SELL
ANYTHING FROM YOUR BODY?

13:12.712 --> 13:14.914
BLOOD, HAIR...

13:14.915 --> 13:16.296
MALE REPRODUCTIVE STUFF?

13:17.677 --> 13:18.878
LET'S PLAY CHARADES.

13:18.879 --> 13:20.090
WHO AM I?

13:24.424 --> 13:25.975
OKAY, ONE LAST QUESTION.

13:25.976 --> 13:29.348
AND THIS COULD MAKE OR BREAK
MY DECISION TO MARRY YOU.

13:29.349 --> 13:31.230
IT'S ABOUT FAMILY.

13:31.231 --> 13:32.731
OH, I LOVE MY MOM, I SWEAR!

13:32.732 --> 13:35.314
YEAH, I SEND HER A CARD EVERY
TIME SHE HAS A FACE LIFT.

13:35.315 --> 13:39.438
ARE YOU PLANNING TO HAVE
ANY LITTLE MELS OR JOES

13:39.439 --> 13:41.700
- IN THE FUTURE?
- YES! YES, WE ARE.

13:41.701 --> 13:43.112
YES, AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

13:43.113 --> 13:44.493
SHE'S GONNA BE AN
AMAZING MOTHER.

13:44.494 --> 13:46.155
AW, AND HE'LL MAKE
AN EVEN BETTER DAD.

13:46.156 --> 13:48.657
SHE KNOWS ME SO WELL.

13:48.658 --> 13:50.119
OH, BOY.

13:50.120 --> 13:52.912
SO YOU REALLY THINK
YOU'RE FIT TO BE PARENTS.

13:52.913 --> 13:54.793
OH! THIS ONE WE CAN
ACTUALLY ANSWER TRUTHFULLY.

13:54.794 --> 13:57.586
JUST LIKE ALL THE OTHER
ANSWERS, RIGHT, HONEY?

13:57.587 --> 13:59.838
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
HOLD THAT THOUGHT, REVEREND.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.220
LENNOX, RYDER!

14:01.221 --> 14:02.551
COULD YOU GUYS COME
DOWN HERE, PLEASE?

14:02.552 --> 14:05.304
SO YOU ALREADY HAVE
CHILDREN TOGETHER

14:05.305 --> 14:06.515
BEFORE MARRIAGE?

14:06.516 --> 14:08.347
HOW VERY MODERN...

14:08.348 --> 14:10.930
AND WHAT A HUGE SIN.

14:10.931 --> 14:13.062
NO NO NO NO NO. WE'RE RAISING
MY TEENAGE NIECE AND NEPHEW

14:13.063 --> 14:14.523
SINCE MY SISTER'S
BEEN IN PRISON.

14:14.524 --> 14:16.735
REVEREND MATTHEWS,
I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET

14:16.736 --> 14:18.107
LENNOX AND RYDER.

14:18.108 --> 14:20.109
I'M SURE THEY'LL PAINT
US IN A GOOD LIGHT.

14:20.110 --> 14:21.320
- YEP.
- YOU GOT IT.

14:21.321 --> 14:23.032
GREAT, THEN TELL ME, KIDS,

14:23.033 --> 14:26.745
HAVE MEL AND JOE BEEN
GOOD ROLE MODELS?

14:26.746 --> 14:29.329
THINK, GUYS, ALL RIGHT? THINK
CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU SPEAK.

14:31.161 --> 14:33.162
WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE AND SOMETHING
LIKE THAT WOULD HAPPEN TO ME,

14:33.163 --> 14:35.374
I WOULD GRAB MY FAKE
I.D., SNEAK INTO A BAR

14:35.375 --> 14:39.378
AND DROWN MY SORROWS IN
A BIG FROSTY MUG OF...

14:39.379 --> 14:40.921
MILK.

14:42.092 --> 14:43.712
THIS IS MY NIECE LENNOX.

14:43.713 --> 14:45.925
SHE'S HERE FOR HER
FIRST FAKE I.D.

14:45.926 --> 14:47.806
AW, THAT'S SO SWEET.

14:47.807 --> 14:51.220
SHE NEED A MEDICAL
MARIJUANA CARD TOO?

14:51.221 --> 14:54.143
I MIGHT HAVE A TOUCH
OF THE GLAUCOMA.

14:54.144 --> 14:55.935
YOU TALKED HER INTO
GOING DOWN THERE.

14:55.936 --> 14:57.186
HOW DID YOU TALK HER
INTO GOING DOWN THERE?

14:57.187 --> 14:58.317
I PAID HER 50 BUCKS.

14:58.318 --> 14:59.979
A BRIBE?!

14:59.980 --> 15:01.650
THAT'S TERRIBLE. NOT
ONLY IS THAT WRONG,

15:01.651 --> 15:02.781
THAT'S HORRIBLE PARENTING.

15:02.782 --> 15:04.613
WELL, I'M NOT A PARENT
AND NEITHER ARE YOU.

15:04.614 --> 15:05.734
CAN I HAVE 50 BUCKS?

15:05.735 --> 15:07.406
Mel and Joe: NO.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.448
I DON'T THINK LENNOX IS GONNA
BE TOO THRILLED WITH THE FACT

15:09.449 --> 15:10.789
WE JUST TALKED ABOUT
HER SEX LIFE ON TV,

15:10.790 --> 15:12.451
SO DO YOU HAVE A PLAN?

15:12.452 --> 15:15.454
I AM PREPARED TO FACE HER
WITH HONESTY AND HUMILITY...

15:15.455 --> 15:17.246
AND THIS $100 GIFT CARD.

15:17.247 --> 15:18.667
A BRIBE?

15:18.668 --> 15:20.589
OH, THAT'S JUST GREAT PARENTING.

15:20.590 --> 15:22.301
CAN IT BE FROM BOTH OF US?

15:22.302 --> 15:24.093
OH, YEAH! WHO'S THE
WEENIE NOW, HUH?

15:24.094 --> 15:25.134
NOT ME.

15:25.135 --> 15:27.387
MY NANNY'S TEACHING
ME HOW TO FIGHT.

15:29.849 --> 15:32.051
LOOK, I'VE HAD MY SHARE
OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS.

15:32.052 --> 15:35.224
OKAY, AFTER COLLEGE I HAD A
THREE-MONTH EURORAIL PASS.

15:35.225 --> 15:38.978
AND LET'S JUST SAY, MY VISA GOT
PUNCHED AT A FEW DIFFERENT STOPS.

15:38.979 --> 15:40.859
UGH!

15:40.860 --> 15:43.692
HOW COULD YOU BE SO STUPID TO
SMOKE POT ON A SCHOOL TRIP?

15:43.693 --> 15:46.196
HOW COULD YOU BE SO STUPID TO
BE THE ONLY ONE TO ADMIT IT?

15:48.448 --> 15:51.280
AUNT MEL AND JOE HAVE TAUGHT
US SO MANY GREAT THINGS.

15:51.281 --> 15:52.661
AW, SO SWEET.

15:52.662 --> 15:54.453
THAT CALLS FOR A FAMILY HUG.

15:54.454 --> 15:55.954
- AWW...
- HEY, BRING IT IN, EVERYBODY.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.206
FAMILY HUG TIME.

15:57.207 --> 15:58.998
OH, I'VE SEEN ENOUGH.

15:58.999 --> 16:01.380
NOT ONLY DID YOU
LIE TO A MINISTER,

16:01.381 --> 16:03.502
BUT YOU FORCED THESE
CHILDREN TO LIE.

16:03.503 --> 16:06.345
THERE'S NO WAY I'LL
SANCTIFY THIS UNION.

16:06.346 --> 16:08.137
BUT... BUT WE LOVE EACH OTHER.

16:08.138 --> 16:12.092
I DON'T GIVE A CRAP. I GOT A
SUCCESS RATE TO WORRY ABOUT.

16:16.306 --> 16:17.976
WAIT, REVEREND MATTHEWS.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.648
YOU REALLY THINK THERE'S SOMETHING
WRONG WITH OUR RELATIONSHIP?

16:19.649 --> 16:20.689
OF COURSE NOT, DEAR.

16:20.690 --> 16:22.441
YOU'RE PERFECTLY NORMAL.

16:22.442 --> 16:26.155
LIKE A LOT OF PERFECTLY
NORMAL COUPLES...

16:26.156 --> 16:28.158
YOU'RE DESTINED FOR DIVORCE.

16:29.159 --> 16:31.070
BYE NOW.

16:31.071 --> 16:32.491
( door closes )

16:32.492 --> 16:34.284
DIVORCE?!

16:37.877 --> 16:38.997
THE NERVE OF THAT GUY, HUH?

16:38.998 --> 16:40.209
WHO IS HE TO JUDGE US?

16:40.210 --> 16:41.420
WHAT MAKES HIM A
RELATIONSHIP EXPERT?

16:41.421 --> 16:43.712
UH, 50 YEARS OF MARRYING PEOPLE

16:43.713 --> 16:45.335
AND THE HIGHEST SUCCESS
RATE IN THE STATE.

16:46.796 --> 16:48.297
HE DOESN'T REALLY KNOW YOU GUYS

16:48.298 --> 16:49.678
OR THE STORY OF
YOUR RELATIONSHIP.

16:49.679 --> 16:52.261
YEAH, AND IT'S SO ROMANTIC.
AND THINK ABOUT IT,

16:52.262 --> 16:54.513
IT CAME SO CLOSE TO
NOT HAPPENING AT ALL.

16:54.514 --> 16:56.475
ALL RIGHT, ONE HAND HERE...

16:56.476 --> 16:58.897
- MM-HMM.
- ...AND MY THUMB THERE.

16:58.898 --> 17:01.400
EXACTLY. AND THE MAN...

17:01.401 --> 17:02.771
THAT WOULD BE ME...

17:02.772 --> 17:04.273
I PUT MY HAND RIGHT HERE.

17:04.274 --> 17:05.604
- ( giggles )
- DON'T LAUGH.

17:05.605 --> 17:07.486
- WELL, DON'T TICKLE ME.
- I'M NOT TICKLING YOU.

17:07.487 --> 17:09.408
- WELL, I'M TICKLISH THERE.
- YOU'RE TICKLISH IN YOUR UPPER BACK?

17:09.409 --> 17:11.410
I'M TICKLISH IN A LOT OF PLACES
I'M NOT GONNA TELL YOU ABOUT.

17:11.411 --> 17:13.412
IT'S LIKE GIVING
AWAY LAUNCH CODES.

17:13.413 --> 17:16.705
WELL, I WOULDN'T WANNA
ACCIDENTALLY SET YOU OFF.

17:16.706 --> 17:18.247
LOOK, YOU'RE GONNA FEEL PRESSURE
AGAINST YOUR HAND, OKAY?

17:18.248 --> 17:19.248
AND YOU'RE GONNA
GO AGAINST THAT.

17:19.249 --> 17:21.120
THIS IS LIKE TWO MAGNETS.

17:21.121 --> 17:22.661
TWO MAGNETS THAT ARE BEING
REPELLED BY EACH OTHER.

17:22.662 --> 17:25.084
OH, SO DANCING WITH YOU
IS BASED ON REPULSION?

17:25.085 --> 17:27.296
I AM GONNA BE AWESOME AT THIS.

17:27.297 --> 17:29.258
YOU'RE SO CUTE, REALLY.

17:29.259 --> 17:30.759
YEAH, AWESOME. OKAY, YOU READY?

17:30.760 --> 17:34.174
- MM-HMM.
- I'M GONNA MOVE AND YOU'RE GONNA FOLLOW.

17:37.056 --> 17:38.057
POP.

17:40.770 --> 17:42.731
- ( chuckles )
- HOW DID THAT FEEL?

17:42.732 --> 17:44.683
GOOD. REALLY GOOD...

17:44.684 --> 17:47.316
I MEAN, IN A DANCING
SORT OF WAY.

17:47.317 --> 17:48.447
SEE, THE TANGO...

17:48.448 --> 17:50.649
IS ALL ABOUT PASSION.

17:50.650 --> 17:53.071
THE MAN LEADS AND
THE WOMAN FOLLOWS

17:53.072 --> 17:55.454
UNTIL THEY BECOME...

17:55.455 --> 17:57.617
ONE.

17:58.908 --> 18:00.749
YOU'RE SPECIAL.
IT'S NOT EVERY DAY

18:00.750 --> 18:02.752
YOU FIND SOMEONE YOU CONNECT
WITH, AND I CONNECT WITH YOU.

18:04.914 --> 18:07.466
YOU'RE SO SPECIAL, ELENA.

18:07.467 --> 18:09.298
I MEAN, IT'S NOT EVERY DAY THAT YOU
FIND SOMEONE THAT YOU CONNECT WITH.

18:09.299 --> 18:11.711
AND I... I REALLY
CONNECT WITH YOU.

18:13.423 --> 18:14.673
I... I DIDN'T REALIZE
UNTIL JUST NOW

18:14.674 --> 18:16.215
HOW MUCH I CARE ABOUT YOU.

18:16.216 --> 18:19.138
I DIDN'T REALIZE TILL NOW
HOW MUCH I CARE ABOUT YOU.

18:19.139 --> 18:21.141
- ( sighs )
- AND...

18:23.183 --> 18:24.723
AND?

18:24.724 --> 18:27.726
AND I'M GONNA MISS YOU WHEN
YOU'RE IN RUSSIA, JOE.

18:27.727 --> 18:29.648
WHAT?

18:29.649 --> 18:32.442
I... YOU TELL HER YOU'RE GONNA
MISS HER WHEN SHE'S GONE, JOE.

18:34.614 --> 18:36.236
OKAY, BYE.

18:37.237 --> 18:38.327
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

18:38.328 --> 18:39.788
WHAT? I...

18:39.789 --> 18:41.370
I WAS JUST SAYING GOODBYE.

18:41.371 --> 18:43.122
DON'T MAKE A BIG DEAL.

18:45.875 --> 18:47.877
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

18:49.128 --> 18:50.420
Austin: SO...

18:51.381 --> 18:54.012
DOCTOR SAID NONE OF THAT
FOR AT LEAST A WEEK.

18:54.013 --> 18:55.595
IT'S TOUGH. I ALWAYS HAVE
THAT LOOK AROUND YOU.

19:01.521 --> 19:03.222
- JOE.
- YEAH?

19:03.223 --> 19:05.185
I LOVE YOU.

19:09.028 --> 19:11.360
COOL. SO LOOK, RYDER IS GONNA BE
IN THE HOSPITAL LIKE TWO DAYS.

19:11.361 --> 19:12.651
SO YOU COULD TAKE
THE FIRST NIGHT,

19:12.652 --> 19:13.822
I COULD TAKE THE SECOND NIGHT.

19:13.823 --> 19:14.943
OR WHATEVER. I COULD
TAKE THE FIRST NIGHT,

19:14.944 --> 19:16.275
YOU COULD TAKE THE SECOND NIGHT.

19:16.276 --> 19:17.406
- IT DOESN'T MATTER TO ME.
- JOE, DID YOU HEAR ME?

19:17.407 --> 19:19.037
YEAH, YOU JUST SAID YOU LOVE ME.
HEH.

19:19.038 --> 19:21.039
YOU WANNA HEAR SOMETHING FUNNY?

19:21.040 --> 19:23.242
RYDER THOUGHT THIS WAS ALL
ABOUT THE PORK, OKAY?

19:23.243 --> 19:25.624
BUT EVERYBODY KNOWS PORK
DOESN'T CAUSE THAT KIND OF...

19:25.625 --> 19:27.246
( groans ) YOU DRIVE ME NUTS!

19:27.247 --> 19:28.587
YOU DRIVE ME NUTS TOO, BUT
WE'RE WE'RE REALLY NOT TALKING

19:28.588 --> 19:29.588
ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW.

19:29.589 --> 19:31.129
AUSTIN WANTED ME TO MARRY HIM.

19:31.130 --> 19:32.501
- AND I SAID NO.
- THAT'S A SMART MOVE.

19:32.502 --> 19:34.002
I NEVER THOUGHT HE
WAS RIGHT FOR YOU.

19:34.003 --> 19:35.093
LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT'S
RIGHT FOR ME?

19:35.094 --> 19:36.094
NO.

19:36.095 --> 19:38.257
BUT, YOU KNOW...

19:38.258 --> 19:40.509
WHEN AM I WRONG? ( guffaws )

19:40.510 --> 19:42.010
SOMETIMES I JUST
WANNA STRANGLE YOU.

19:42.011 --> 19:44.644
OH, WOULD YOU TWO JUST
STOP TALKING AND KISS?!

19:53.192 --> 19:54.863
SEE, THAT WORKS.

19:54.864 --> 19:57.025
YEAH, BECAUSE WHEN WE'RE
KISSING, YOU'RE NOT TALKING.

19:57.026 --> 19:58.197
WELL, I...

20:01.581 --> 20:04.623
YOU KNOW, IF YOU BOTH STILL WANNA GET
MARRIED AFTER ALL YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH,

20:04.624 --> 20:06.245
THAT SAYS SOMETHING.

20:06.246 --> 20:07.536
EITHER YOU REALLY
LOVE EACH OTHER

20:07.537 --> 20:09.538
OR YOU'RE COMPLETELY NUTS.

20:09.539 --> 20:12.130
OR BOTH.

20:12.131 --> 20:15.424
WELL, I GUESS ALL THAT REALLY MATTERS
IS HOW WE FEEL ABOUT OUR MARRIAGE.

20:15.425 --> 20:16.715
WHO CARES WHAT
ANYONE ELSE THINKS?

20:16.716 --> 20:18.297
YOU KNOW WHAT? I DON'T CARE
WHO MARRIES US, HONEY,

20:18.298 --> 20:19.298
AS LONG AS I GET TO MARRY YOU.

20:19.299 --> 20:20.679
OH.

20:20.680 --> 20:22.100
MMM.

20:22.101 --> 20:23.682
SO THERE'S NOTHING YOU
WOULD CHANGE ABOUT ME?

20:23.683 --> 20:26.475
LET ME THINK, UM...

20:26.476 --> 20:28.437
- NOPE, NOTHING.
- YOU HAD SOMETHING IN THERE.

20:28.438 --> 20:31.270
- UH, DEFINITELY NOTHING.
- YEAH, I SAW IT IN YOUR EYES.

20:31.271 --> 20:33.272
- YOU WERE THINKING SOMETHING.
- ABSOLUTELY NOT.

20:33.273 --> 20:36.525
AND THAT IS, UH...
THAT'S ALMOST THE TRUTH.

20:36.526 --> 20:37.856
GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME.

20:37.857 --> 20:39.068
( quietly ) ALL RIGHT.

20:42.702 --> 20:44.413
LOOK, REVEREND MATTHEWS
LEFT HIS LIST OF QUESTIONS.

20:44.414 --> 20:46.034
OH, THIS ONE'S A GOODY.

20:46.035 --> 20:48.957
"DO YOU EVER HAVE A PROBLEM
EXPRESSING YOURSELF TO YOUR PARTNER?

20:48.958 --> 20:51.420
DO YOU HAVE A HARD TIME
FINDING THE RIGHT WORDS?"

20:51.421 --> 20:53.632
- HA, NOT US.
- NOPE.

20:53.633 --> 20:56.045
NO ONE IN THIS HOUSE EVER HAS
TROUBLE FINDING THE RIGHT WORDS.

20:57.927 --> 20:59.137
- MARK.
- ( beeps )

20:59.138 --> 21:00.339
I HOPE ONE DAY I
CAN GET OUT OF...

21:00.340 --> 21:01.800
( groans )

21:01.801 --> 21:03.472
- ( beeps )
- ONE DAY I CAN GET OUT OF...

21:03.473 --> 21:05.384
( clears throat )

21:05.385 --> 21:07.386
I HOPE ONE DAY I CAN
GET OUT AS MUCH AS...

21:07.387 --> 21:09.348
OUT OF CABLE TV AS YOU...

21:09.349 --> 21:10.769
- HOLD ON.
- ( beeps )

21:10.770 --> 21:12.981
( blows raspberry, laughs )

21:12.982 --> 21:14.022
( beeps )

21:14.023 --> 21:15.273
YOU NEED TO, YOU KNOW...

21:15.274 --> 21:16.485
WE FIGURE... FIGURE OUT

21:16.486 --> 21:19.448
WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO NEXT.

21:19.449 --> 21:20.819
- ( beeps )
- YEAH, BUT I DON'T HAVE TO

21:20.820 --> 21:22.110
WAIT THREE YEARS TO EAT IT.

21:22.111 --> 21:24.032
HIM. I... UH, MY DINNER.

21:24.033 --> 21:25.495
WHAT?
