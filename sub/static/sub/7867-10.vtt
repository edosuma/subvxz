02:05.653 --> 02:07.728
Today we induct
the newest honoree

02:07.795 --> 02:10.439
to the Springfield Wall of Fame,
who will take his place

02:10.506 --> 02:11.978
along such luminaries as

02:12.046 --> 02:15.627
Duffman, Poochie and the man
who invented the yield sign,

02:15.695 --> 02:17.000
Paul Yield.

02:17.067 --> 02:19.309
Now please welcome
the newest inductee

02:19.376 --> 02:21.184
into the Springfield
Wall Of Fame,

02:21.250 --> 02:24.933
local businessman, frequent
flyer silver card-holder

02:25.000 --> 02:27.376
and legendary 20% tipper...

02:27.443 --> 02:28.649
(crowd gasps)

02:28.715 --> 02:31.394
...Springfield's own
Vance Connor!

02:31.460 --> 02:33.200
(cheering, applause)

02:33.267 --> 02:34.506
Hey. Hi.

02:34.573 --> 02:35.844
BARNEY:
You're better than us!

02:39.092 --> 02:40.800
Homer, that guy's
your age?

02:40.866 --> 02:42.740
No, he's ten days younger.

02:42.808 --> 02:45.150
So you're saying
he'll look like you in ten days?

02:45.217 --> 02:46.623
If he's lucky.

02:46.690 --> 02:48.866
The guy owns
a few local businesses

02:48.933 --> 02:51.209
and everyone treats him
like he's God.

02:51.275 --> 02:53.987
Well, God doesn't need
his own special day.

02:54.054 --> 02:55.292
What about Sunday?

02:55.360 --> 02:58.473
Sunday's the Lord's day,
boy, not God's.

02:58.540 --> 02:59.778
Completely different guy.

02:59.844 --> 03:01.653
Your father's
just jealous because

03:01.720 --> 03:04.029
Vance was our class president
in high school.

03:04.096 --> 03:06.104
If I had won class president,

03:06.172 --> 03:08.614
I'd be the one getting thrown
up in the air right now.

03:08.681 --> 03:11.025
Dad, you ran for
class president?

03:11.091 --> 03:14.003
Yep, back in high school,
right before I met your mother.

03:14.070 --> 03:17.217
A simpler time when the
only thing we worried about

03:17.283 --> 03:20.062
was total nuclear
annihilation.

03:20.128 --> 03:21.067
<i>Rock the boat</i>

03:21.133 --> 03:22.807
Don't rock the boat, baby

03:22.874 --> 03:24.514
<i>Rock the boat
Don't tip the boat...</i>

03:24.581 --> 03:26.188
So under my reign
as vice president,

03:26.255 --> 03:28.832
we sent three mathletes
to the state finals,

03:28.899 --> 03:31.510
all of the tenth graders'
lima beans germinated...

03:31.578 --> 03:32.849
(cheering)

03:32.916 --> 03:34.556
Yeah, you should be proud!

03:34.622 --> 03:37.167
So if you want to build on that,
vote for me,

03:37.234 --> 03:39.611
<i>and you will all advance...</i>

03:39.678 --> 03:41.719
with Vance!

03:41.786 --> 03:43.159
(cheering)

03:43.225 --> 03:45.536
And now I'm gonna
throw it back to a guy who,

03:45.602 --> 03:49.318
in my opinion, is the classiest
principal in the business,

03:49.385 --> 03:50.355
Principal Dondelinger!
(coughs)

03:50.422 --> 03:51.326
(cheering, applause)

03:51.393 --> 03:53.033
Ladies, I've seen him up close,

03:53.100 --> 03:54.774
and yes, his eyes
are that green.

03:54.841 --> 03:57.652
Our next candidate
is, uh, Homer Simpson.

03:57.719 --> 03:59.828
Please hold
your applause forever.

03:59.895 --> 04:01.735
(microphone feedback squeals)

04:04.580 --> 04:06.925
My fellow Wildcats,

04:06.992 --> 04:09.268
my name is Homer Simpson.

04:09.334 --> 04:11.209
There are many reasons why

04:11.276 --> 04:14.188
I, uh, I, I--

04:14.254 --> 04:16.464
You know what?

04:16.529 --> 04:17.702
(murmuring)

04:17.769 --> 04:20.178
I spent all night
working on that speech,

04:20.245 --> 04:23.158
but now I realize the best thing
to do is speak from my heart.

04:23.226 --> 04:24.163
(murmuring)

04:24.230 --> 04:27.008
So, uh...

04:27.075 --> 04:30.657
I feel that, fellow Wildcats...

04:30.724 --> 04:32.397
(panicky gasps)

04:32.464 --> 04:34.874
Um, um, "Webster's defines--"

04:34.941 --> 04:37.920
Um, "In the words
of Ted Nugent--"

04:37.986 --> 04:39.025
"School spirit--"
"Next card--"

04:39.091 --> 04:40.062
"The future..."

04:40.129 --> 04:41.234
(laughter)

04:41.301 --> 04:44.146
I've never heard
a speech so bad.

04:44.213 --> 04:45.151
Ten days detention!

04:45.218 --> 04:46.623
No fair!

04:46.690 --> 04:49.267
Anyone who votes for Vance
gets a half-day tomorrow.

04:49.334 --> 04:51.744
Mm, half-day, eh?

04:51.811 --> 04:53.619
(sighs)

04:53.685 --> 04:55.057
Don't feel
bad, Homie.

04:55.125 --> 04:56.497
I married you.

04:56.565 --> 04:58.104
And you're a million
times better than--

04:58.170 --> 04:59.142
(gasps)

04:59.209 --> 05:00.681
Here comes Vance!

05:00.748 --> 05:01.853
Hey, Vance!

05:01.919 --> 05:02.858
Thanks for coming out.

05:02.924 --> 05:03.927
Hey, Gail.

05:03.995 --> 05:05.267
Ooh, I love your bangs.
Hi.

05:06.706 --> 05:10.054
Uh, there they are,
my favorite mixed-race couple.

05:10.120 --> 05:13.669
Guys that popular and confident
are never truly happy.

05:13.736 --> 05:14.841
He looks happy.

05:14.908 --> 05:16.681
Tears of a clown.

05:16.748 --> 05:19.258
He's not crying,
and he's not known for clowning.

05:19.325 --> 05:21.568
Exception
that proves the rule.

05:21.635 --> 05:23.946
If losers like me
know one thing,

05:24.012 --> 05:27.325
it's that deep down,
winners like him are miserable.

05:27.393 --> 05:28.832
Watch, I'll prove it.

05:28.899 --> 05:31.175
Angry nut coming through!

05:31.242 --> 05:33.484
Clear a path, boys.

05:33.551 --> 05:34.556
(muttering)

05:35.728 --> 05:36.731
Hey, Vance.

05:36.799 --> 05:38.473
Hey, Homer Simpson.
How you been?

05:38.540 --> 05:40.045
Great, thanks.

05:40.112 --> 05:41.418
Listen,
settle a bet.

05:41.485 --> 05:43.493
Behind that smile
you're dying, right?

05:43.560 --> 05:46.539
Behind this smile is a bigger
smile trying to get out.

05:46.606 --> 05:49.250
Oh, oh, here it comes!

05:49.318 --> 05:50.490
Oh, yeah.

05:50.556 --> 05:51.760
Please!

05:51.827 --> 05:53.736
You got to have
some secret agony!

05:53.803 --> 05:55.409
I bet those fancy
shoes hurt your feet.

05:55.476 --> 05:57.083
No, actually they're like
two leather clouds.

05:57.149 --> 05:58.523
Oh!

05:58.589 --> 06:00.832
Got them from a buddy of mine
with a store in Shelbyville.

06:00.899 --> 06:01.904
You want his number?

06:01.970 --> 06:03.710
No. Yes.

06:05.318 --> 06:09.434
Hey, Homer, you want to try
my new Vance Connor-politan?

06:09.501 --> 06:13.719
Like Vance, it is smooth, cool
and oh, so sophisticated.

06:13.786 --> 06:15.928
I'll just stick with my beer.

06:15.995 --> 06:18.338
Homer, why are you
so down on Vance Connor?

06:18.405 --> 06:19.845
He gave me one of his kidneys.

06:19.912 --> 06:21.049
Yeah, me, too.

06:21.116 --> 06:23.058
Because when Vance
beat me in that election,

06:23.125 --> 06:24.564
he ruined my life.

06:26.004 --> 06:29.585
Why'd you just exchange
that look of guilt?

06:29.652 --> 06:32.263
Lenny, uh, I-I think it's
time for us to come clean.

06:32.330 --> 06:34.439
About how we give
each other haircuts?

06:34.506 --> 06:36.580
No, we'll take that
secret to our graves.

06:36.648 --> 06:39.359
I'm talking about,
uh, you know.

06:39.426 --> 06:40.832
Oh, right.
(clears throat)

06:40.899 --> 06:43.510
Listen, Homer, something weird
happened back in high school.

06:45.284 --> 06:47.258
<i>Teenage Carl and I were walking
down the hallway when...</i>

06:47.325 --> 06:49.100
You two, I want you
to take this box

06:49.166 --> 06:51.610
and bury it in the woods.

06:51.677 --> 06:55.359
The true results of this
election must never be known.

06:57.602 --> 06:59.778
Tell you what-- we'll do
it under one condition:

06:59.844 --> 07:01.986
Our parents want us
to go to college,

07:02.053 --> 07:04.263
but with a bad enough
recommendation from you,

07:04.330 --> 07:05.869
we can stay here
and party.

07:05.936 --> 07:07.911
Okay, but screw this up,

07:07.977 --> 07:10.355
and it's Carnegie-Mellon
University for the both of you!

07:10.422 --> 07:12.262
(both gasp)

07:14.438 --> 07:16.748
So there's a chance
I actually won!

07:16.814 --> 07:18.756
I've got to dig up
that ballot box!

07:18.823 --> 07:20.496
Just let it
go, Homer.

07:20.564 --> 07:21.970
Al Gore?

07:22.037 --> 07:24.983
Homer, I had a presidential
election stolen from me.

07:25.049 --> 07:26.521
But I moved on,

07:26.589 --> 07:28.664
and I think you could say

07:28.731 --> 07:31.041
everything worked out all right.

07:31.108 --> 07:33.753
Isn't that right, Alfred?

07:33.819 --> 07:35.861
(speaking in a falsetto,
as Alfred Nobel):
It sure is, Albert.

07:37.634 --> 07:40.012
(Homer mumbling)

07:40.079 --> 07:41.852
Ballots...

07:41.919 --> 07:42.991
stolen...

07:43.058 --> 07:44.195
real winner unknown.

07:44.263 --> 07:45.669
What is the truth?

07:45.736 --> 07:46.739
I gotta know.

07:48.681 --> 07:50.656
Lenny! Wake up!
(gasps)

07:50.723 --> 07:52.932
Finally, you returned
my shovel.

07:52.999 --> 07:54.907
That's not why I'm here.
Get dressed.

07:54.974 --> 07:57.117
California casual
or business attire?

07:57.183 --> 07:59.694
California casual.

07:59.761 --> 08:00.866
(gulps)

08:00.932 --> 08:03.778
(grunting and panting)

08:03.844 --> 08:05.216
(clunk)
There it is!

08:05.283 --> 08:06.288
The ballot box?!

08:06.355 --> 08:07.794
No, this is the box

08:07.860 --> 08:11.175
that tells us where
the ballot box is.

08:11.241 --> 08:13.484
LENNY:
"Right under this."

08:16.028 --> 08:18.506
What will this box reveal?

08:18.573 --> 08:20.446
And what will I use this box
for afterwards?

08:20.514 --> 08:21.920
Mismatched bolts and nuts?

08:21.986 --> 08:22.957
Recipes?

08:23.024 --> 08:24.898
I may never know.

08:24.965 --> 08:26.271
<i>LISA:
Vance Connor.
HOMER: D'oh!</i>

08:26.338 --> 08:27.611
<i>Homer Simpson.
Woo-hoo!</i>

08:27.677 --> 08:29.250
Vance Connor.
D'oh!

08:29.317 --> 08:30.656
Homer Simpson.
Woo-hoo!

08:30.724 --> 08:31.895
Vance Connor.
D'oh!

08:31.961 --> 08:33.133
Homer Simpson.
Woo-hoo!

08:33.200 --> 08:34.572
Please stop doing that.

08:34.639 --> 08:36.380
"D'oh!" or "woo-hoo!"?

08:36.447 --> 08:38.221
Both. Homer Simpson.

08:38.288 --> 08:39.525
Vance Connor.

08:39.594 --> 08:40.630
Fonzie.

08:40.698 --> 08:41.937
Homer Simpson.

08:42.003 --> 08:43.577
And the winner is...

08:43.643 --> 08:44.647
(gasps)

08:44.715 --> 08:46.053
Homer Simpson!

08:46.120 --> 08:48.431
Yes! I'm Senior Class President!

08:48.497 --> 08:49.836
I get a parking spot

08:49.903 --> 08:51.810
if the Assistant Principal
isn't using it!

08:51.877 --> 08:52.815
(laughs)

08:52.881 --> 08:54.856
Wait a second.

08:54.923 --> 08:56.832
If I'd been Class President

08:56.898 --> 08:58.170
like I was supposed to,

08:58.237 --> 08:59.878
I'd be the one with
the big mansion

08:59.945 --> 09:01.652
and the color TVs
and the hot wife!

09:01.718 --> 09:02.489
Hey!

09:02.555 --> 09:03.526
Marge, I still would

09:03.593 --> 09:04.530
be married to you,

09:04.597 --> 09:06.571
but you would just be hotter.

09:06.638 --> 09:07.911
Oh!

09:07.978 --> 09:10.087
Dad, just 'cause you won
a high school election

09:10.154 --> 09:12.096
doesn't mean your whole life
would've been better.

09:12.163 --> 09:14.237
That's exactly
what it means.

09:14.304 --> 09:16.982
And Dondelinger took
that life away from me.

09:17.049 --> 09:18.621
And the taking of a life
is murder.

09:18.689 --> 09:20.464
And the punishment
for murder is--

09:20.530 --> 09:22.840
well, it varies from state
to state and by race.

09:22.907 --> 09:24.714
But I'm going to
find Dondelinger

09:24.781 --> 09:26.221
and tell him I know

09:26.287 --> 09:27.861
what he did last summer...

09:27.927 --> 09:29.535
22 years ago...

09:29.602 --> 09:32.312
in the winter!

09:33.568 --> 09:35.342
(golf cart whirring)

09:35.409 --> 09:36.580
(tires screeching)

09:40.497 --> 09:41.702
(chuckles)
That's--

09:41.769 --> 09:43.275
that's the thing about
you Assistant Principals.

09:43.342 --> 09:45.250
You can drive the ball,
but you can't putt.

09:45.316 --> 09:46.957
(laughing)

09:47.024 --> 09:48.563
Wait a minute!
You're not in
our foursome.

09:48.631 --> 09:49.869
No other foursome would have me.

09:49.936 --> 09:51.576
My legs gross people out.

09:51.643 --> 09:54.086
HOMER:
Dondelinger!

09:56.397 --> 09:58.237
Uh-oh! Looks like one
of my former students

09:58.305 --> 09:59.910
on a quest for truth.

09:59.977 --> 10:01.953
(Bart screaming)

10:02.020 --> 10:04.463
Dondelinger, I should have
been Class President,

10:04.530 --> 10:06.606
but you stole
the election from me.

10:06.672 --> 10:08.079
I can explain.

10:08.145 --> 10:10.924
But are you sure we should
talk in front of your son?

10:10.991 --> 10:12.564
Yes! I want him to know

10:12.631 --> 10:14.405
that if your life doesn't
turn out the way you want

10:14.472 --> 10:15.609
there's someone else
to blame!

10:15.677 --> 10:17.016
Oh, I already knew
that, Dad.

10:17.082 --> 10:18.153
I'm going to blame you.

10:18.220 --> 10:19.493
I respect your choice.

10:19.559 --> 10:20.831
Now drive back to
the clubhouse

10:20.898 --> 10:22.103
and order me a
Tom Collins.

10:22.170 --> 10:23.677
With a virgin
Tom Collins for me?

10:23.743 --> 10:25.317
Virgin? What are
you, a girl?

10:31.308 --> 10:33.351
(Bart giggling)

10:33.417 --> 10:35.693
Now, Dondelinger,
I want some answers.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.434
Very well.

10:37.501 --> 10:39.241
It's a fact I didn't
like you, Simpson.
Still don't.

10:39.308 --> 10:41.117
You lie. You love me!

10:41.182 --> 10:42.923
Whatever complex
emotions I feel,

10:42.990 --> 10:44.630
they're not why I
did what I did.

10:44.697 --> 10:46.706
There was another reason....

10:46.774 --> 10:49.384
J-J-jive talkin'

10:49.451 --> 10:51.392
You're telling me lies

10:51.459 --> 10:53.400
J-Jive talkin'...

10:53.467 --> 10:55.007
(chuckles)
Homer Simpson.

10:55.074 --> 10:56.345
What a loser.

10:56.412 --> 10:58.321
Hey, what if we got everyone
to vote for him,

10:58.388 --> 10:59.760
as a joke, and he won?

10:59.827 --> 11:01.635
Then we could laugh
at him all the way

11:01.702 --> 11:03.710
through high school
and at every reunion.

11:03.777 --> 11:05.618
BOTH:
Go, sports!

11:05.685 --> 11:07.526
(grunting)

11:09.602 --> 11:11.375
Hmm.
Yeah.
Mm.

11:11.442 --> 11:13.183
So you see,

11:13.250 --> 11:16.531
I disposed of the ballot box
to spare your feelings.

11:16.597 --> 11:18.572
You denied me my dream,

11:18.639 --> 11:20.145
so I'm angry.

11:20.212 --> 11:22.655
But you did it out of kindness,
so I'm grateful.

11:22.722 --> 11:25.569
I'm filled with respect
and contempt for you!

11:25.634 --> 11:26.906
I really...

11:26.974 --> 11:28.646
Oh, why, you...!

11:28.714 --> 11:30.589
Oh! But...
(grunting)

11:30.655 --> 11:31.894
Oh, you're so--

11:31.961 --> 11:33.400
I hate you!
Mm-hmm.

11:33.467 --> 11:36.212
As principal, I did a lot of
things I'm not proud of.

11:36.279 --> 11:39.392
I would steal school chalk
for my home chalkboard.

11:39.459 --> 11:41.500
But I'm not sorry
I rigged that election.

11:41.568 --> 11:42.906
Now if you'll excuse me,

11:42.974 --> 11:44.480
I'm going to sit
under that tree

11:44.546 --> 11:46.388
and think of all the women I
could've talked to but didn't.

11:47.559 --> 11:49.133
(sighs)

11:49.199 --> 11:51.342
The brown-haired girl
gave me a look.

11:51.409 --> 11:54.154
The redhead in the park
was reading a book.

11:54.220 --> 11:57.032
The girl at the airport
upgraded my car.

11:57.099 --> 12:00.279
Tonight I wonder
just where you are.

12:03.425 --> 12:05.701
Homie, you're
barely eating.

12:05.769 --> 12:07.308
Yeah, I can actually
see your hands.

12:07.374 --> 12:08.413
They're not just a blur.

12:08.480 --> 12:10.488
I don't feel much like eating.

12:10.554 --> 12:12.062
I'll never know
what would've happened

12:12.129 --> 12:13.902
if I'd have been
class president.

12:13.969 --> 12:15.476
MAN (with Italian accent):
Oh, you could know...

12:15.543 --> 12:16.982
if you dared.

12:17.048 --> 12:18.421
Huh? Who said that?

12:18.488 --> 12:19.727
In the kitchen
is a man

12:19.794 --> 12:21.935
from the old country
who works for me.

12:22.003 --> 12:23.709
He stirs the sauce-a.

12:23.777 --> 12:26.086
They say if he stirs
the sauce-a

12:26.153 --> 12:27.860
just-a right,

12:27.927 --> 12:31.274
he can also see
what might have been.

12:31.341 --> 12:33.551
As a rational
skeptic,

12:33.618 --> 12:35.291
I find that hard
to believe.

12:35.358 --> 12:38.237
Also, as a vegetarian, I hope
there's not meat in that sauce.

12:38.304 --> 12:40.446
Any other orders, Mussolini?

12:40.512 --> 12:41.685
No, that's it.

12:41.752 --> 12:43.358
Watch the sauce.

12:43.425 --> 12:45.367
You see what I see.

12:45.434 --> 12:46.739
I see a hair.

12:46.805 --> 12:48.145
You see too much.

12:48.212 --> 12:50.857
Now, watch the sauce
of bubbling red

12:50.924 --> 12:52.932
and see the life
you could have led.

12:52.998 --> 12:53.970
Okay.

12:54.037 --> 12:56.982
(grunting)

12:57.049 --> 12:59.894
Yes, I like to stir.

13:01.802 --> 13:04.780
Your new Senior Class
President is:

13:04.848 --> 13:06.020
(chuckles)

13:06.087 --> 13:07.760
(sighs)
Homer Simpson.

13:07.827 --> 13:09.533
(all laughing)

13:09.600 --> 13:11.409
Our president's
a real loser!

13:11.476 --> 13:13.182
Yeah. A loser...
like us!

13:13.249 --> 13:15.224
He proves you don't
have to be popular

13:15.290 --> 13:16.831
to have everyone
like you!

13:16.898 --> 13:17.970
(chanting):
Homer!

13:18.037 --> 13:19.710
Homer! Homer!
Homer!

13:19.777 --> 13:20.882
Homer!

13:20.948 --> 13:21.952
ALL (chanting):
Homer!

13:22.019 --> 13:23.961
Homer! Homer!

13:24.028 --> 13:26.070
<i>Homer! Homer!</i>

13:26.136 --> 13:26.873
<i>(fading out):
Homer!</i>

13:28.312 --> 13:29.718
I would've
been a winner,

13:29.785 --> 13:32.162
instead of some idiot spending
his Saturday night

13:32.229 --> 13:34.270
staring into a bowl of sauce.

13:34.337 --> 13:37.282
Why did fate do this to me?

13:37.350 --> 13:40.362
Ask the garlic bread.

13:40.429 --> 13:42.102
Why?

13:42.170 --> 13:43.911
Why?
Hey, everyone!

13:43.978 --> 13:46.688
The stupid fat man is
talking to garlic bread!

13:46.756 --> 13:49.166
(cackling)

13:50.171 --> 13:51.508
Come on, stir.

13:51.576 --> 13:52.580
I must see more.

13:52.647 --> 13:54.387
Homey, please.

13:54.454 --> 13:55.593
Nothing good
will come of this.

13:55.660 --> 13:56.998
Marge, unlike CPR,

13:57.065 --> 13:58.605
this is something
I must know.

13:58.672 --> 13:59.742
Very well.

13:59.809 --> 14:01.953
Now we must once more

14:02.019 --> 14:04.128
stare madly
into the sauce.

14:11.626 --> 14:13.199
Mr. President,
we need a class song,

14:13.267 --> 14:14.940
a class motto
and a class mascot.

14:15.007 --> 14:16.212
"Color My World,"

14:16.279 --> 14:18.019
"Disco Sucks"
and Butthead the Goat.

14:18.086 --> 14:19.458
Mr. President,

14:19.526 --> 14:21.534
do you approve of the
bailout of the French Club?

14:21.601 --> 14:22.974
They're too big to fail.

14:23.041 --> 14:25.651
Homer, do you have a date
for the prom yet?

14:25.718 --> 14:28.128
Sorry, the only girl
I could ever want

14:28.195 --> 14:29.802
is right over there.

14:29.868 --> 14:32.244
Debbie Pinson.

14:35.024 --> 14:36.596
Hey, Debbie, um...

14:36.664 --> 14:37.836
Want to go to prom with me?

14:37.902 --> 14:39.977
Well, I'm engaged
to the quarterback,

14:40.045 --> 14:41.081
but yes!

14:43.994 --> 14:45.366
Forget it, Marge.

14:45.433 --> 14:48.647
A girl like you could never
land a Homer Simpson.

14:48.714 --> 14:49.852
<i>LISA:
Aha!</i>

14:49.919 --> 14:52.162
So Dad's life would actually
have been worse,

14:52.228 --> 14:54.236
because he wouldn't have
gotten together with Mom,

14:54.304 --> 14:56.077
his one true love.

14:56.144 --> 14:58.989
Just keep watching
the sauce, girlie.

14:59.056 --> 15:02.304
(music playing)

15:02.370 --> 15:04.581
(sighing)

15:04.647 --> 15:07.693
I got the biggest lapels,
the ruffliest shirt,

15:07.759 --> 15:09.935
and the most
beautiful...
(gasps)

15:10.003 --> 15:11.006
girl.

15:11.073 --> 15:12.513
Thank you, Homer.

15:12.580 --> 15:15.492
Debbie, I forgot I have an
English paper due on Monday.

15:15.559 --> 15:18.003
Would you read "To Kill A
Mockingbird" for me?

15:18.069 --> 15:20.144
And if you could write
down how Boo Radley fits

15:20.211 --> 15:22.721
into the Southern Gothic
tradition, that would be great.

15:22.788 --> 15:25.600
Nobody's ever asked me
to use my head-brain before!

15:26.572 --> 15:29.718
(applause)

15:32.027 --> 15:33.132
Uh, Homer Simpson.

15:33.199 --> 15:34.571
Class President.

15:34.638 --> 15:36.479
<i>Oh my God,
he's talking to me!</i>

15:36.547 --> 15:38.354
A lot of great things have
happened to me lately,

15:38.420 --> 15:40.462
but they're nothing
compared to meeting you.

15:40.529 --> 15:42.639
May I have this dance?

15:42.705 --> 15:45.249
Only if it lasts forever.

15:47.726 --> 15:49.232
Homer Simpson!

15:49.298 --> 15:51.609
I was going to let you
get to fifth base.

15:51.677 --> 15:54.756
It would've been something you
told your grandchildren about.

15:54.823 --> 15:56.027
Sorry, Debbie.

15:56.094 --> 15:58.437
I hope you can
find happiness without me.

15:58.504 --> 16:01.215
(humming
romantic tune)

16:01.282 --> 16:04.195
Who wants a cheerleader
on the rebound?

16:05.165 --> 16:06.740
I do!
Oh, right.

16:09.282 --> 16:12.530
I can hardly believe
this is real.

16:12.597 --> 16:14.806
Marge, the way
I feel about you

16:14.873 --> 16:18.086
is as real and lasting
as my hairline.

16:19.894 --> 16:23.743
Ooh. Who's that side of beef
munchin' on our sister?

16:23.810 --> 16:27.458
I don't know, but in this
reality, I am not gay!

16:27.525 --> 16:28.998
Hubba hubba!

16:29.065 --> 16:29.969
(crickets chirping)

16:30.036 --> 16:31.240
Sweet dreams!

16:34.320 --> 16:36.430
Young man,
you have the noble bearing

16:36.496 --> 16:38.671
of the barbarian leader
Vercingetorix.

16:38.739 --> 16:40.714
Thank you,
mysterious weirdo.

16:40.780 --> 16:43.190
Tell me, what student government
office do you hold?

16:43.258 --> 16:44.362
Secretary?

16:44.429 --> 16:45.400
Treasurer?

16:45.467 --> 16:47.676
Dare I say Secretary-Treasurer?

16:47.743 --> 16:49.048
I'm Class President.

16:49.115 --> 16:50.588
Oh, hot dog!

16:50.656 --> 16:53.902
Say, how would you
like to work for me?

16:53.969 --> 16:56.245
Sir, we could start him
off in Sector 7-G.

16:56.312 --> 16:58.018
7-G?

16:58.086 --> 16:59.827
Let the Lennys and the Carls
of the world

16:59.894 --> 17:01.198
waste their wretched lives

17:01.266 --> 17:03.007
in that testicle-shriveling
torture chamber.

17:03.074 --> 17:05.048
Son, you'll be working in...

17:05.115 --> 17:07.123
Sector 6-F!

17:07.190 --> 17:08.429
(sighing)

17:08.496 --> 17:09.567
<i>LISA:
Aha!</i>

17:09.633 --> 17:11.608
So Dad's life
would have been the same.

17:11.675 --> 17:13.785
He would have married
Mom and worked for Mr. Burns.

17:13.852 --> 17:15.391
It would have been a push.

17:15.457 --> 17:17.199
Can you keep
her quiet?

17:17.266 --> 17:18.704
Not even when
she's snorkeling.

17:18.771 --> 17:21.281
I was describing
beautiful fish, Bart.

17:21.348 --> 17:23.057
(sighing)

17:29.918 --> 17:33.265
(whistling tune)

17:33.332 --> 17:35.073
How you doin', Dad?

17:35.141 --> 17:37.818
Oh, I can't complain
and I never do!

17:37.885 --> 17:39.458
Thanks for letting me live
in your guest house.

17:45.382 --> 17:46.788
Honey, I'm home.

17:49.266 --> 17:50.906
Where are the kids?

17:50.972 --> 17:52.345
You used protection.

17:52.412 --> 17:54.019
We never had any.

17:54.085 --> 17:56.830
Well, that's what's missing.

17:56.897 --> 18:00.010
Our lives would be horrible
without the kids.

18:00.077 --> 18:01.282
Uh, yes.

18:01.349 --> 18:02.454
That must be it.

18:02.521 --> 18:04.362
This is the best
of all possible worlds.

18:04.429 --> 18:05.701
Blah, blah, blah, and...

18:05.767 --> 18:07.039
I want to live in the sauce!

18:08.814 --> 18:10.287
If you could live
in the sauce,

18:10.354 --> 18:12.395
don't you think
I would live in the sauce?

18:12.462 --> 18:13.367
Stupid-o!

18:15.173 --> 18:16.445
(sighing)

18:16.513 --> 18:17.851
How long has
he been there?

18:17.917 --> 18:20.428
I don't know, but
he's algaefying.

18:20.496 --> 18:21.768
(splashing)

18:21.834 --> 18:23.776
Homie, please come inside.

18:23.842 --> 18:24.947
Okay.

18:25.014 --> 18:26.754
(sighing)

18:26.822 --> 18:28.864
Dad, we need
to have a talk.

18:28.931 --> 18:30.102
Oh, I get it.

18:30.169 --> 18:31.575
You're all going to try
to convince me

18:31.643 --> 18:34.152
that my life is great
just like it is, right?

18:34.220 --> 18:35.893
Are you kidding?
We couldn't even convince you

18:35.960 --> 18:37.567
that Bruce Wayne is Batman.

18:37.634 --> 18:38.671
Oh, come on!

18:38.739 --> 18:40.144
That millionaire playboy?

18:40.212 --> 18:42.521
He's too busy socializing
at cocktail parties

18:42.588 --> 18:44.562
and managing the affairs
of the Wayne foundation.

18:44.629 --> 18:46.806
Don't open
this one again.

18:46.873 --> 18:48.914
Why does he think Alfred's
friends with Batman?

18:48.981 --> 18:50.319
Just stop.

18:50.386 --> 18:53.265
Dad, we think the sauce
had it all wrong.

18:53.332 --> 18:56.110
Oh, look who thinks
he's smarter than sauce.

18:57.684 --> 18:59.725
Sweetheart, I think
you'll feel better

18:59.792 --> 19:01.634
after we take
a little walk.

19:01.701 --> 19:04.713
HOMER:
Oh, why would you bring me here?

19:04.780 --> 19:07.291
It's like bringing Richard
Nixon to the Watergate.

19:07.358 --> 19:09.266
Or Kevin Costner
to Waterworld.

19:09.333 --> 19:10.838
Oh, really?

19:12.646 --> 19:15.090
(gasping)
My own plaque!

19:15.156 --> 19:17.332
And one for
Vice-President Butthead.

19:17.399 --> 19:18.571
Cool.

19:18.638 --> 19:21.584
Is that why you
brought me here, spirits?

19:21.651 --> 19:24.664
Yep. In the future, people will
look at this and they'll say,

19:24.730 --> 19:27.509
"Whoever he was,
he must've mattered."

19:27.576 --> 19:30.018
I guess that
would be nice.

19:30.086 --> 19:31.490
Oh, pardon me,
can my son

19:31.558 --> 19:32.998
have his picture
taken with you?

19:33.065 --> 19:34.705
Really?
Sure.

19:37.382 --> 19:41.265
Dad, do you think I could
be elected Class President?

19:41.332 --> 19:43.541
Well, we can't all
be Homer Simpson, son.

19:43.608 --> 19:46.755
Thanks, guys.

19:46.821 --> 19:49.399
Hey, was there another plaque
here before?

19:49.466 --> 19:51.777
Plaques come,
plaques go.

19:55.692 --> 19:57.399
Now let's get
something to eat.

19:57.467 --> 19:58.604
How 'bout Italian?

19:58.671 --> 20:00.278
God, no!

20:00.345 --> 20:01.984
I hear there's a
Korean barbeque place

20:02.052 --> 20:03.860
where the beef spells out
the date of your death.

20:03.926 --> 20:06.437
Ooh, that sounds
like fun!

20:52.797 --> 20:53.634
Shh!

20:54.305 --> 21:00.882
