WEBVTT

00:01.837 --> 00:03.221
Walden, are you almost ready?

00:03.223 --> 00:05.556
Almost.

00:06.859 --> 00:10.178
How is it possible that I am
always ready before you are?

00:10.180 --> 00:11.929
Hey, it takes a lot of work

00:11.931 --> 00:14.515
to make it look
like I don't care how I look.

00:14.517 --> 00:16.484
Please, let's go.
I'm starving.

00:16.486 --> 00:18.736
Just give me a minute.
I'm having a bad beard day.

00:18.738 --> 00:21.239
Is there such a thing
as a <i>good</i> beard day?

00:21.241 --> 00:23.024
Absolutely.

00:23.026 --> 00:25.109
Usually I wake up,
and it's all soft and fluffy,

00:25.111 --> 00:26.778
but I must have
slept on it wrong,

00:26.780 --> 00:29.163
'cause this side's, like,
flat and listless.

00:29.165 --> 00:31.165
Oh, if it's causing
you such problems,

00:31.167 --> 00:33.284
why don't you
just shave it off?

00:33.286 --> 00:34.919
I thought you loved my beard.

00:34.921 --> 00:36.921
No, I never
said that.

00:38.757 --> 00:41.325
Then why'd you go out
with me in the first place?

00:41.327 --> 00:44.128
I don't judge a person
by what's on the surface.

00:44.130 --> 00:47.381
Yeah, but yet you're asking me
to shave my surface.

00:47.383 --> 00:48.699
Yes, please.

00:48.701 --> 00:50.852
Wow.

00:50.854 --> 00:52.637
I mean, is there anything else

00:52.639 --> 00:54.439
about me that's not
working for you?

00:54.441 --> 00:56.641
As long as you ask,

00:56.643 --> 01:00.778
I'm not crazy about the
Jennifer Aniston hairdo.

01:06.552 --> 01:08.686
Okay. This is...

01:08.688 --> 01:10.738
I'm-I'm... I'm a little...
I'm a little confused here.

01:10.740 --> 01:12.690
I thought you liked
the way I looked.

01:12.692 --> 01:14.292
Oh, I do. I do.

01:14.294 --> 01:17.662
I just think I'd like it better
if the ratio of hair to face

01:17.664 --> 01:20.581
was more on the
face side of things.

01:20.583 --> 01:23.334
Well, I will definitely
give it some thought.

01:23.336 --> 01:26.637
Oh. I don't want you to do
anything you don't want to do.

01:26.639 --> 01:29.540
Although, to be fair, I did
remove some hair for you.

01:29.542 --> 01:32.360
After I almost
choked to death.

01:36.548 --> 01:39.650
Okay, just need to post
a profile picture,

01:39.652 --> 01:42.937
and let the dating begin.

01:50.779 --> 01:52.864
Whoa.

01:52.866 --> 01:55.399

Hello, sailor!

02:15.888 --> 02:18.723
Wow. More chins
than a Chinese phone book.

02:20.175 --> 02:22.760
Hey. We're heading out.

02:22.762 --> 02:24.145
Have a nice dinner.

02:24.147 --> 02:25.980
What are you going
to do tonight?

02:25.982 --> 02:27.648
Well, I don't want
to jinx myself,

02:27.650 --> 02:30.952
but I'm hoping to rub one out
and be asleep by 10:00.

02:32.454 --> 02:33.538
Rub one out?

02:33.540 --> 02:35.323
Oh, he's gonna wait
till we leave,

02:35.325 --> 02:36.824
watch some porn
and masturbate.

02:36.826 --> 02:38.626
Ah.

02:38.628 --> 02:40.077
Oh. Ick.

02:40.079 --> 02:41.245
You know what?

02:41.247 --> 02:42.780
Don't just hang
out here alone.

02:42.782 --> 02:45.833
Why don't you just
join us for dinner?

02:45.835 --> 02:47.919
Oh, no, no, no. I don't want
to be a third wheel.

02:47.921 --> 02:49.003
You two kids have a great time.

02:49.005 --> 02:51.138
Thank you.
No.

02:51.140 --> 02:52.590
We insist.

02:52.592 --> 02:54.959
Tell him, Zoey.

02:55.811 --> 02:58.029
Do join us, won't you?

02:58.031 --> 02:59.981
Great.

02:59.983 --> 03:01.899
Rain check.
Where we eating?

03:01.901 --> 03:05.436
I was thinking about trying out
that new Italian place on PCH.

03:05.438 --> 03:07.188
Ooh, really? Italian?
That's kind of heavy.

03:07.190 --> 03:08.940
What are you
in the mood for?

03:08.942 --> 03:10.775
Oh, no, no. It's your night.
I'm just tagging along.

03:10.777 --> 03:12.777
I was rather looking
forward to Italian, so...

03:12.779 --> 03:14.979
Well, you heard her.

That's another advantage
of having a beard.

something left to snack on.

04:01.508 --> 04:03.658
Charming.

04:03.660 --> 04:05.543
She's not crazy
about the facial hair.

04:05.545 --> 04:06.928
Oh, are you kidding?

04:06.930 --> 04:08.663
He looks so rugged and sexy.

04:08.665 --> 04:10.048
Grr.

04:10.050 --> 04:11.549
Well, if it's such
a wonderful look,

04:11.551 --> 04:12.717
why don't you grow a beard?

04:12.719 --> 04:14.469
Oh, I tried.
Grew in patchy.

04:14.471 --> 04:16.837
I looked like a possum on chemo.

04:16.839 --> 04:19.724
Oh. Well, I think
most women would agree

04:19.726 --> 04:21.442
that men look
much more attractive

04:21.444 --> 04:22.677
when they're
properly groomed.

04:22.679 --> 04:23.861
Really?

04:23.863 --> 04:25.346
I've always been
properly groomed,

04:25.348 --> 04:27.398
and all it's gotten me
is two divorces

04:27.400 --> 04:28.950
and carpal tunnel syndrome.

04:28.952 --> 04:31.736
Oh. Ick.

04:32.621 --> 04:35.073
Alan, check out the bar.

04:37.743 --> 04:39.827
Oh. Wow.

04:39.829 --> 04:41.796
She looks fantastic.

04:41.798 --> 04:43.331
Who's that?

04:43.333 --> 04:44.465
It's Alan's old girlfriend.

04:44.467 --> 04:46.134
You're joking.

04:48.003 --> 04:49.887
What's that supposed to mean?

04:49.889 --> 04:52.056
Nothing. Well done. Well done.

04:54.426 --> 04:56.344
Alan, go say hello to her.

04:56.346 --> 04:59.046
Oh, I don't know. I mean,
as much as I'd like to see her,

04:59.048 --> 05:01.099
I'm not sure
she still wants to see me.

05:01.101 --> 05:02.767
Uh, it didn't end well.

05:02.769 --> 05:03.985
What happened?

05:03.987 --> 05:06.454
Did she catch you
rubbing one out?

05:07.573 --> 05:09.223
- Did I say that right?
- That was perfect.

05:09.225 --> 05:10.408
Yeah? Okay.

05:12.161 --> 05:13.444
Just go say hello to her.

05:15.231 --> 05:17.565
Well, guess
it couldn't hurt.

05:17.567 --> 05:19.701
I mean, she does look
a little pathetic

05:19.703 --> 05:21.536
just sitting there
all by herself

05:21.538 --> 05:24.071
waiting to get hit on
by some loser.

05:24.073 --> 05:26.574
By all means,
save her from that.

05:27.426 --> 05:30.077
All right, wish me luck.

05:30.079 --> 05:31.713
Good luck.

05:31.715 --> 05:33.598
Go get 'em.

05:33.600 --> 05:37.585
Seriously, what's
wrong with her?

05:37.587 --> 05:40.104
Hey, stranger.

05:40.106 --> 05:42.140
Alan!

05:42.142 --> 05:44.609
Hi! How have you been?

05:44.611 --> 05:45.893
Uh, good. Good. You?

05:45.895 --> 05:48.112
Real good.

05:48.114 --> 05:50.398
Well, you look beautiful.

05:50.400 --> 05:52.433
Thank you.

05:53.268 --> 05:55.320
Yeah, I've been
working out.

05:55.322 --> 05:56.821
Good.

05:56.823 --> 05:59.624
Good, good. So, uh, what are
you doing here all by yourself?

05:59.626 --> 06:01.125
- Oh, well...
- Sorry.

06:01.127 --> 06:04.495
I don't think that valet has
ever driven a Ferrari before.

06:04.497 --> 06:07.114
Alan, this is
my friend Dylan.

06:07.116 --> 06:08.299
Dylan, this is Alan.

06:08.301 --> 06:09.550
- Oh, hey.
- Hey, Alan.

06:09.552 --> 06:10.968
Uh, Dylan, huh?

06:10.970 --> 06:12.220
Uh, named after Bob?

06:12.222 --> 06:13.671
No, named after my dad.

06:13.673 --> 06:15.056
He was named after Bob.

06:15.058 --> 06:17.842
Okay. Okay.

06:17.844 --> 06:20.011
Uh, well, it was
nice to meet you.

06:20.013 --> 06:22.430
Uh, Lyndsey, it's always
great to see you.

06:22.432 --> 06:25.683
Um, I-I should get
back to my date.

06:25.685 --> 06:29.003
Yeah, Walden's trying to
set me up with his baby sister.

06:29.005 --> 06:30.021
She's very pretty.

06:30.023 --> 06:32.023
Oh, yeah, she's okay.

06:40.082 --> 06:42.316
Uh, it's a very
close family.

06:51.510 --> 06:54.212
Seems overly complicated.

06:54.214 --> 06:56.347
What?

06:56.349 --> 06:59.500
Why don't they just make chips
with the dip already on 'em?

06:59.502 --> 07:01.769
Dude.

07:01.771 --> 07:04.272
Dude...

07:04.274 --> 07:06.841
that's a million-dollar idea.

07:06.843 --> 07:09.510
What is?

07:09.512 --> 07:11.612
Pre-dipped chips.

07:11.614 --> 07:15.516
See, that's
a million-dollar idea.

07:15.518 --> 07:18.686
What's a million-dollar idea?

07:18.688 --> 07:21.289
It's an idea
worth a million dollars.

07:21.291 --> 07:25.576
Boy, I wish I had one of those.

07:27.080 --> 07:29.580
I can't believe they brought
back <i>Beavis and Butt-Head.</i>

07:29.582 --> 07:32.917
Yeah. Those guys are,
like, too stupid to live.

07:37.474 --> 07:39.390
Uh-oh. That's my dad.

07:39.392 --> 07:41.676
Quick, give me
that air freshener.

07:46.715 --> 07:48.516
This is bug spray, dude.

07:50.385 --> 07:52.203
Says it's for roaches.

07:54.573 --> 07:56.741
Perfect.

07:58.410 --> 07:59.894
Just forget about her, Alan.

07:59.896 --> 08:02.280
I'm sure Zoey has some single
friends she can fix you up with.

08:02.282 --> 08:03.531
No, I don't. Sorry.

08:03.533 --> 08:06.534
I just can't get over
how young the guy is.

08:06.536 --> 08:09.720
Well, a clean-shaven face
will do that for a man.

08:11.790 --> 08:13.424
Well, thanks again for dinner.

08:13.426 --> 08:16.410
I really thought
I was gonna eat both lobsters.

08:18.413 --> 08:21.098
You really don't have
any single friends?

08:21.100 --> 08:23.584
Shh. Just
keep walking.

08:23.586 --> 08:24.769
Hey.

08:24.771 --> 08:26.387
Hey.
Hey.

08:26.389 --> 08:27.922
Oh, my God!

08:27.924 --> 08:29.307
Is that bug spray?

08:29.309 --> 08:31.976
Yeah, we were just
getting rid of some roaches.

08:33.361 --> 08:36.113
Maybe we need
to call an exterminator.

08:36.115 --> 08:38.316
I think we need
to call Domino's.

08:41.203 --> 08:43.654
Mind if I hang out
with you guys?

08:43.655 --> 08:46.624
Sure.

08:51.414 --> 08:53.214
Who's dumber
than Beavis and Butt-Head?

08:55.952 --> 08:58.302
Oh, hey, Eldridge,
I ran into your mom tonight.

08:58.304 --> 09:00.638
Really? Was she with Dylan?

09:00.640 --> 09:02.139
Yeah, yeah.
Have you met him?

09:02.141 --> 09:04.308
What's he like?
Is it serious?

09:04.310 --> 09:06.661
I doubt it. He's gay.

09:06.663 --> 09:08.295
What? He's gay?

09:08.297 --> 09:10.398
Oh, yeah, big poof.

09:10.400 --> 09:13.601
Always hugging me
a little too long.

09:13.603 --> 09:16.654
Wait. Are we talking
about the guy with the Ferrari?

09:16.656 --> 09:18.189
Yeah. Dylan.

09:18.191 --> 09:20.508
I once saw him wearing
my mom's underwear.

09:20.510 --> 09:23.661
Oh, well, that doesn't mean
he's gay. He...

09:26.949 --> 09:29.984
He might just like
pretty things.

09:32.588 --> 09:34.967
Um, does your mom
ever mention me?

09:34.992 --> 09:35.624
Yeah.

09:35.625 --> 09:37.792
Yeah, all the time.
She really misses you.

09:37.794 --> 09:39.544
You should stop by some time.

09:39.546 --> 09:41.662
Huh.

09:42.765 --> 09:44.382
Well, it's not too late.

09:44.384 --> 09:48.836
Maybe I'll wander over there
and carpe me some diem.

09:52.808 --> 09:54.892
Way to get rid of him.

09:54.894 --> 09:56.611
Thanks.

09:56.613 --> 09:58.112
Was any of it true?

09:58.114 --> 10:00.314
Not a word.

10:04.036 --> 10:07.405
What does "carpe me
some diem" mean?

10:07.407 --> 10:09.957
It's French
for "bang your mom."

10:11.710 --> 10:14.078
♪ Men.

10:14.913 --> 10:16.464
Mmm.
Mmm. Hang on.

10:18.635 --> 10:20.301
Beard.

10:20.303 --> 10:21.702
Oh, please.

10:21.704 --> 10:23.537
I know what you're
trying to do.

10:23.539 --> 10:24.889
What?

10:24.891 --> 10:26.741
Do you really hate
my beard that much?

10:26.743 --> 10:29.010
"Hate" is a very strong word.

10:29.012 --> 10:30.728
But, yeah, I hate it.

10:30.730 --> 10:32.346
Okay, I don't
understand.

10:32.348 --> 10:33.881
We've been going out
for a couple months.

10:33.883 --> 10:35.766
Why is it all of a
sudden the problem?

10:35.768 --> 10:38.052
All right.

10:38.054 --> 10:40.438
This is probably
going to sound very shallow,

10:40.440 --> 10:43.774
but there's a cocktail party
at my office this weekend,

10:43.776 --> 10:46.327
and since I'm on the fast track

No, I was
a prison barber.

12:05.505 --> 12:08.172

was mostly about lice control
