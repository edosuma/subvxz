WEBVTT

00:00.410 --> 00:02.377
<i> Previously, on
Hell's Kitchen...</i>

00:02.411 --> 00:03.511
Go now.

00:03.546 --> 00:05.380
In the steak challenge...

00:05.414 --> 00:07.916
I'm doing a rib eye with
a blackberry vanilla sauce.

00:07.950 --> 00:10.685
The chefs had to be creative
with different cuts of meat.

00:10.719 --> 00:12.153
Oh, yeah.

00:12.188 --> 00:14.756
We're men, we cook steak.
This is ours for the winning.

00:14.790 --> 00:16.491
And although
the men were confident

00:16.525 --> 00:18.126
they would finally
get a victory...

00:18.160 --> 00:19.527
I just can't believe
you've overcooked the steak.

00:19.562 --> 00:20.895
The women...

00:20.930 --> 00:21.963
<i> Coratulations, red team.</i>

00:21.997 --> 00:23.098
Whoo!

00:23.132 --> 00:24.432
Yes!

00:24.467 --> 00:26.835
Handed them
another crushing defeat.

00:26.869 --> 00:28.937
We lost again.

00:28.971 --> 00:30.004
At dinner service...

00:30.039 --> 00:31.339
I'm dying right now.

00:31.373 --> 00:32.874
Barrettt put
the blue kitchen behind.

00:32.908 --> 00:34.409
Barrettt,!

00:34.443 --> 00:35.477
You bring the salad, right?

00:35.511 --> 00:37.545
Like...
Hello?

00:37.580 --> 00:38.546
But Anthony...

00:38.581 --> 00:39.547
Four cocktails coming up.

00:39.582 --> 00:40.548
And Michael...

00:40.583 --> 00:41.950
How are they?
Perfect.

00:41.984 --> 00:43.852
Helped secure
a much-needed victory

00:43.886 --> 00:46.221
Look at that, like a team.
Up at the pass all together.

00:46.255 --> 00:47.355
<i>Good job, guys.</i>

00:47.389 --> 00:48.423
Finally, a decent service.

00:48.457 --> 00:49.891
In the red kitchen...

00:49.925 --> 00:52.927
Raw filet. It's not
Sushi night, it's steak night!

00:52.962 --> 00:54.395
Jacqueline...

00:54.430 --> 00:55.396
And Amanda...

00:55.431 --> 00:56.664
Filet!

00:56.699 --> 00:57.999
Four minutes, chef!

00:58.033 --> 00:59.367
Oh, my God!

00:59.401 --> 01:00.401
Struggled with the steaks.

01:00.436 --> 01:02.203
What is it,
for the second time?

01:02.238 --> 01:04.572
It's raw, chef.

01:04.607 --> 01:06.341
That's right, it's raw!

01:06.375 --> 01:09.444
And their lack of consistency
brought the entire kitchen down.

01:09.478 --> 01:13.615
You, you, you, you,
off, all four of you!

01:13.649 --> 01:15.049
Get out!

01:15.084 --> 01:16.818
I am so mad right now.

01:16.852 --> 01:17.819
The red team's
frustration and anger

01:17.853 --> 01:19.420
reached a boiling point
in the dorm.

01:19.455 --> 01:21.356
So I'm not shutting
the up!

01:21.390 --> 01:22.991
Going on and on and on,
and it's done!

01:23.025 --> 01:25.393
Bitch, I'm not gonna
take it anymore.

01:25.427 --> 01:27.562
And forced to put
two up for elimination...

01:27.596 --> 01:29.430
It was like
a freak show.

01:29.465 --> 01:31.483
The women nominated...
Amanda.

01:31.561 --> 01:33.098
And...
Jacqueline, chef.

01:33.602 --> 01:35.670
After her disastrous
turn on the meat station...

01:35.704 --> 01:37.238
Jacqueline,
give me your jacket.

01:37.273 --> 01:39.040
Jacqueline's
dream of becoming head chef

01:39.074 --> 01:41.476
of Gordon Ramsay pub and grill
at Caesars Palace

01:41.510 --> 01:45.046
went up in flames.

01:47.483 --> 01:48.850
* Fire

01:48.884 --> 01:50.785
Whoa...

01:50.819 --> 01:53.721
* The way you swerve and curve

01:53.756 --> 01:55.557
* really wrecks my nerves

01:55.591 --> 01:57.992
* and I'm so excited, child
ohh!

01:58.027 --> 02:00.128
<i>Go, Jon!</i>

02:00.162 --> 02:02.964
* When you take
what you've got *

02:02.998 --> 02:04.933
* and, girl, you've got a lot

02:04.967 --> 02:06.401
* you're really smokin', child

02:09.270 --> 02:12.207
* When you're hot, you're hot

02:12.241 --> 02:14.042
* you really shoot your shot

02:14.076 --> 02:15.944
* you're dynamite, child

02:15.978 --> 02:17.745
* yeah, yeah

02:17.780 --> 02:20.815
* well, I can tell
by your game *

02:20.849 --> 02:23.618
* you're gonna start a flame

02:23.652 --> 02:26.688
* of love, baby, baby

02:26.722 --> 02:30.191
* the way you push, push

02:30.226 --> 02:31.793
* lets me know that

02:31.827 --> 02:33.161
Hey, hey!

02:34.263 --> 02:35.296
* You're gonna get your wish

02:35.331 --> 02:37.165
* oh, no

02:37.199 --> 02:38.933
* fire

02:38.968 --> 02:40.902
* what I said, child

02:40.936 --> 02:44.239
* ow, fire

02:44.273 --> 02:46.541
* uh-huh

02:46.575 --> 02:50.044
* got me burning,
got me burning *

02:50.079 --> 02:54.015
<i> And now, the continuation
of Hell's Kitchen.</i>

02:55.384 --> 02:57.452
Leave me alone, guys.
Get out.

02:57.486 --> 03:00.321
I'm feeling
like a piece of.

03:00.356 --> 03:01.889
I should be the one

03:01.924 --> 03:04.959
that chef Ramsay's patting
on the shoulder every night,

03:04.994 --> 03:06.494
but I was on
the chopping block.

03:06.528 --> 03:08.963
It sucks.

03:08.998 --> 03:11.266
I feel like you've been folding,
so you can't do it anymore.

03:11.300 --> 03:12.867
That's the only reason
I said you, Amanda,

03:12.901 --> 03:14.402
<i>is because you've
been folding.</i>

03:14.436 --> 03:15.403
And how you reacted
when you went upstairs

03:15.437 --> 03:16.671
and packed your

03:16.705 --> 03:17.872
<i>Is the reason why
I said you were weak.</i>

03:17.906 --> 03:19.841
You have to step up.
You have to pick that slack up.

03:19.875 --> 03:22.043
I want to shine

03:22.077 --> 03:23.845
and become a leader
for the red team.

03:23.879 --> 03:26.180
That's what chef Ramsay's
looking for,

03:26.215 --> 03:30.385
and that's what I need to show.

03:30.419 --> 03:33.021
As the number of
chefs continues to dwindle,

03:33.055 --> 03:35.156
the remaining chefs
are reinvigorated...

03:35.190 --> 03:36.891
Unbreakable, homie.

03:36.925 --> 03:39.460
And prepared to show chef
Ramsay they are ready for anything.

03:39.495 --> 03:41.596
<i>
I like that energy. Wow.</i>

03:41.630 --> 03:43.331
<i>Good morning.</i>

03:43.365 --> 03:44.499
Morning, chef.

03:44.533 --> 03:45.933
<i>
Last night after service,</i>

03:45.968 --> 03:49.771
James, Andy, and I were talking
about when we really started

03:49.805 --> 03:51.239
to develop
our love for cooking.

03:51.273 --> 03:53.841
<i>But it's interesting
that it was</i>

03:53.876 --> 03:56.444
when we were all teenagers.

03:56.478 --> 03:58.813
When I was a teen,
I had two loves.

03:58.847 --> 04:00.048
A love of cooking...

04:02.851 --> 04:04.385
And a love of soccer.

04:04.420 --> 04:05.386
Oh...

04:05.421 --> 04:06.387
Oh, my God.

04:07.523 --> 04:09.223
Who knew looking at this picture

04:09.258 --> 04:10.558
that this cute, little kid
from Scotland

04:10.592 --> 04:12.327
was gonna turn out to be
such a hard-ass in the kitchen?

04:12.361 --> 04:14.162
Uh, why are you guys
all laughing?

04:14.196 --> 04:17.999
<i>Trust me, I did a little
research of my own.</i>

04:18.033 --> 04:19.000
Oh, no.

04:19.034 --> 04:21.636
<i>Let's take a look.</i>

04:23.472 --> 04:24.706
Yeah!

04:24.740 --> 04:26.240
Oh, my God.

04:26.275 --> 04:28.309
Zach's hair moved from his head
all the way down to his chin.

04:28.344 --> 04:29.577
They swapped places.

04:29.611 --> 04:31.312
Ready for the next one?

04:31.347 --> 04:32.513
Whoa!

04:34.083 --> 04:36.150
Nedra!

04:36.185 --> 04:37.885
<i> Cyndi!
Whoa.</i>

04:37.920 --> 04:40.355
Looking back
into our younger years...

04:40.389 --> 04:42.090
Oh, my God!

04:42.124 --> 04:43.758
It's freakin' hysterical.

04:45.561 --> 04:46.561
Brace yourselves.

04:46.595 --> 04:48.029
Oh!

04:48.063 --> 04:49.864
Holy hell!

04:49.898 --> 04:50.865
Ray, seriously.

04:50.899 --> 04:52.400
Like a mobster or something.

04:52.434 --> 04:55.737
Old school Ray, he could just
pop his collar on you.

04:55.771 --> 04:58.473
Hey, baby, hows you doin'?

05:00.309 --> 05:04.445
Okay, there is one more picture
I'd like to show you all.

05:04.480 --> 05:06.247
This one's
a very important one.

05:06.281 --> 05:08.483
<i>This is Brianna.</i>

05:08.517 --> 05:10.718
Now, this pic wasn't
taken ten years ago,

05:10.753 --> 05:11.919
this is her today.

05:11.954 --> 05:15.123
<i>She is turning 15,
and tomorrow night,</i>

05:15.157 --> 05:17.258
<i>we'll be hosting
our first ever Quinceanera.</i>

05:20.396 --> 05:21.996
Huh? What's it called?
"Quintenita," "quintiera"?

05:22.030 --> 05:24.999
Quinceanera is
a Latin-American tradition

05:25.033 --> 05:27.702
<i>commemorating when
a young lady becomes a woman.</i>

05:27.736 --> 05:28.936
Nice.
Nice.

05:28.971 --> 05:31.139
Now, are you ready to meet
our guest of honor?

05:31.173 --> 05:32.306
Yes, chef.

05:33.842 --> 05:35.476
Whoo!

05:35.511 --> 05:38.246
*

05:42.785 --> 05:44.519
Nice to see you, darling.
You're welcome.

05:44.553 --> 05:45.787
Good to see you.

05:45.821 --> 05:47.121
<i>How are you, my darling?</i>

05:47.156 --> 05:48.756
Welcome.

05:48.791 --> 05:50.091
<i>Welcome, welcome, welcome.</i>

05:50.125 --> 05:51.325
Give a warm welcome
to Brianna...

05:54.263 --> 05:55.563
Brianna's young,

05:55.597 --> 05:58.366
and she's so tiny and cute.

05:58.400 --> 05:59.434
Her mother Jennifer...

05:59.468 --> 06:01.169
Hi.

06:03.105 --> 06:04.439
And her godmother
and party planner

06:04.473 --> 06:06.107
<i>Josette.
Hello.</i>

06:07.543 --> 06:09.010
So, chefs, listen carefully.

06:09.044 --> 06:10.378
Because for your
next challenge,

06:10.412 --> 06:12.613
<i>you'll be creating
a tasting menu</i>

06:12.648 --> 06:14.916
<i>for this Quinceanera.</i>

06:14.950 --> 06:16.984
Tell me what you're
looking for in the food.

06:17.019 --> 06:19.487
Well, I love chicken.

06:19.521 --> 06:22.990
<i>I like it creamy, lemony...</i>

06:23.025 --> 06:23.991
Mm-hmm.

06:24.026 --> 06:25.259
I also like, um,
fun appetizers.

06:25.294 --> 06:26.360
<i> Nice.</i>

06:26.395 --> 06:28.162
Jennifer?

06:28.197 --> 06:31.799
Something that's spicy
but not too spicy.

06:31.834 --> 06:33.334
If it's too spicy,
Brianna just won't eat it.

06:33.368 --> 06:35.036
<i> Right.</i>

06:35.070 --> 06:37.939
Really? A young latina
that doesn't like spicy food?

06:37.973 --> 06:39.273
Where did she grow up?

06:39.308 --> 06:40.274
Josette?

06:40.309 --> 06:41.843
We like to eat meat.

06:41.877 --> 06:43.945
<i>Good, hearty portions of it.</i>

06:43.979 --> 06:45.446
Please.

06:45.481 --> 06:47.048
Brianna, what is
your favorite appetizer?

06:47.082 --> 06:50.184
Cheese.
Cheese is my favorite.

06:50.219 --> 06:52.286
<i> What kinds of
meat do you like?</i>

06:52.321 --> 06:54.722
Or styles you like it cooked?

06:54.756 --> 06:55.990
We like steak.

06:56.024 --> 06:58.326
<i>A medium to a well,</i>

06:58.360 --> 07:00.228
something that's just hearty.

07:00.262 --> 07:02.964
Please raise your hand
if you have any more questions.

07:02.998 --> 07:05.533
Question after
question, I don't need more.

07:05.567 --> 07:07.702
What does Rihanna,
her mom, and her godmom

07:07.736 --> 07:09.036
know about food anyway?

07:09.071 --> 07:10.571
Let the chefs do the cooking.

07:10.606 --> 07:12.173
Based on what
you've just heard,

07:12.207 --> 07:16.644
you'll have 45 minutes
to create two appetizers.

07:16.678 --> 07:18.079
One cold, one hot.

07:18.113 --> 07:21.716
<i>One pasta dish, one chicken,
and one steak entree.</i>

07:21.750 --> 07:23.251
Chefs, are you ready?

07:23.285 --> 07:24.585
Yes, chef.

07:24.620 --> 07:26.787
<i> 45 minutes,
starting from...</i>

07:26.822 --> 07:28.556
Now. Off you go.

07:28.590 --> 07:29.857
Let's talk, let's talk.

07:29.892 --> 07:31.592
Guys, I'm gonna do
macaroni and cheese sticks.

07:31.627 --> 07:33.094
Mary's gonna start
on the chicken.

07:33.128 --> 07:34.428
I'm gonna do a ravioli, okay?

07:34.463 --> 07:35.796
In the Quinceanera challenge,

07:35.831 --> 07:38.799
chef Ramsay has given
the teams 45 minutes

07:38.834 --> 07:42.203
to create a five-course tasting
menu for the special occasion.

07:42.237 --> 07:45.072
Mm, that smells
like a Quinceanera.

07:45.107 --> 07:46.941
How we feeling, girls?
Everybody's working?

07:46.975 --> 07:49.010
Yeah.
We're gonna make it.

07:49.044 --> 07:50.311
And we're gonna make it good.

07:50.345 --> 07:52.413
Every girl on the red team,
we've been there.

07:52.447 --> 07:53.814
We've all been
a 15-year-old.

07:53.849 --> 07:56.083
The opportunity to give this
to Brianna is just amazing.

07:56.118 --> 07:58.886
<i> She wanted
creamy, cheesy, lemony.</i>

07:58.921 --> 08:00.221
<i>All right, we're good.</i>

08:00.255 --> 08:02.156
We need hot sauce too.
Where's the hot sauce?

08:02.190 --> 08:05.326
Oh, there you are.
I was looking for you.

08:07.396 --> 08:10.765
I figure Spanish people,
hot sauce.

08:10.799 --> 08:13.935
They work out
pretty well, right?

08:13.969 --> 08:15.136
Ooh, I like it.
Got a kick to it.

08:15.170 --> 08:16.771
Halfway, ladies.
Yes, chef.

08:16.805 --> 08:18.940
Amanda, doing all right?

08:18.974 --> 08:20.641
Yes, feeling good.
Awesome.

08:20.676 --> 08:21.943
Today is my redemption.

08:21.977 --> 08:24.278
We've definitely got this.

08:24.313 --> 08:25.346
All right, steak's on, guys.

08:25.380 --> 08:26.347
Thank you.

08:26.381 --> 08:27.548
Last five minutes, guys.

08:27.583 --> 08:29.083
We're at crunch time, guys.

08:29.117 --> 08:30.618
<i>Ray, you need that pasta
in that water.</i>

08:30.652 --> 08:32.219
<i>You're not gonna make it, man.</i>

08:32.254 --> 08:34.322
Losing challenges
is demoralizing.

08:34.356 --> 08:37.325
So today, I'm doing
everything possible

08:37.359 --> 08:38.926
to make sure that we win
this challenge.

08:38.961 --> 08:41.095
Mike, how you doing
with your meat, man?

08:41.129 --> 08:43.197
It's here.
I don't have it... yeah.

08:43.231 --> 08:44.799
<i> All right, just
make sure you got time.</i>

08:44.833 --> 08:46.667
I'm not droppi the ball
on that steak.

08:46.702 --> 08:47.668
That's for sure.

08:47.703 --> 08:50.805
30 seconds to go!

08:50.839 --> 08:51.806
<i> Move, guys.</i>

08:51.840 --> 08:53.407
Who needs help?

08:53.442 --> 08:54.408
<i> Let's go, if
we're not on plates,</i>

08:54.443 --> 08:56.377
<i>we need to be getting 'em.</i>

08:56.411 --> 09:00.214
<i>
Five, four, three, two,</i>

09:00.248 --> 09:02.750
One...
And stop.

09:04.820 --> 09:08.222
Okay, we're gonna start off
with the cold appetizers.

09:08.256 --> 09:09.223
<i>Come on up, please, let's go.</i>

09:09.257 --> 09:11.258
Yeah, buddy.

09:11.293 --> 09:12.426
<i> Ja'nel, please
explain the dish.</i>

09:12.461 --> 09:14.695
I wanted to do a ceviche.

09:14.730 --> 09:16.931
<i>It's mango, cucumber, jalapeno,</i>

09:16.965 --> 09:18.699
orange, lime.

09:18.734 --> 09:19.734
I like that.

09:19.768 --> 09:20.935
<i> It was good.</i>

09:20.969 --> 09:22.103
It was not too spicy.

09:22.137 --> 09:23.104
Thank you.

09:23.138 --> 09:24.171
Jon, please explain.

09:24.206 --> 09:26.474
Okay, I also did a ceviche.

09:26.508 --> 09:28.576
A very thinly-sliced Halibut,
lobster, and crab.

09:28.610 --> 09:29.977
<i>I put it in a little,
crispy shell</i>

09:30.012 --> 09:32.246
so it's easier
to pick up and eat.

09:32.280 --> 09:34.749
I like it 'cause
I can taste the lemony.

09:34.783 --> 09:36.017
<i> Very good flavor.</i>

09:36.051 --> 09:37.852
I especially like
the fried on the outside.

09:37.886 --> 09:38.886
Thank you.

09:38.920 --> 09:39.920
Ladies, tough decision.

09:39.955 --> 09:41.222
<i>The red team or blue team?</i>

09:41.256 --> 09:42.857
My favorite was the blue team.

09:42.891 --> 09:43.858
Wow. Jennifer.

09:43.892 --> 09:44.859
I'll go with the blue team.

09:44.893 --> 09:45.860
<i> Brianna?</i>

09:45.894 --> 09:47.294
The blue team.

09:47.329 --> 09:49.130
Wow, congratulations, blue team.
Good stuff.

09:49.164 --> 09:51.032
Yeah, Jonny.

09:51.066 --> 09:52.366
Kicked ass.
I know.

09:52.401 --> 09:55.136
Next, the battle
of the hot apps.

09:55.170 --> 09:57.538
With Jon giving
the blue team the early lead,

09:57.572 --> 09:59.874
Cyndi's fried cheese
raviolis...

09:59.908 --> 10:01.409
<i> I like it because</i>

10:01.443 --> 10:04.745
the cheese comes out, and it's...
like, it's hot and melty.

10:04.780 --> 10:05.780
Impress the judges.

10:05.814 --> 10:06.914
Very good.

10:06.948 --> 10:08.516
But Barrettt hopes to top her

10:08.550 --> 10:12.586
with his fried
macaroni and cheese balls.

10:13.722 --> 10:15.056
You okay?

10:15.090 --> 10:16.290
<i>The sauce...</i>

10:16.324 --> 10:17.925
Is a little spicy.

10:17.959 --> 10:20.127
<i>Tastes more like hot sauce.</i>

10:20.162 --> 10:21.228
Oh, my God.

10:21.263 --> 10:23.197
Spicy hot sauce.

10:23.231 --> 10:26.634
I mean, guys, did you even
listen to what Brianna wanted?

10:26.668 --> 10:28.169
<i> If it's too spicy,</i>

10:28.203 --> 10:29.704
Brianna just won't eat it.

10:29.738 --> 10:30.771
Red or blue, please?

10:30.806 --> 10:31.906
Good job, red team.

10:31.940 --> 10:33.140
I have to agree with Josette.

10:33.175 --> 10:35.042
The red team.

10:35.077 --> 10:36.544
<i> Red. Wow. Red wins.
Really good job indeed.</i>

10:36.578 --> 10:37.611
Good job, Cyndi.

10:37.646 --> 10:39.013
We're tied.

10:39.047 --> 10:40.848
<i> Whoo, ladies!</i>

10:42.117 --> 10:43.718
Next course, the pasta, please.
Let's go.

10:43.752 --> 10:46.520
I look over, and guess
who's going up with me.

10:46.555 --> 10:49.523
Grandpa Ray.
I got this one in the bag.

10:49.558 --> 10:51.025
I have here

10:51.059 --> 10:55.663
<i>grilled shrimp
with an herb marinade.</i>

10:55.697 --> 10:56.831
I like it.

10:56.865 --> 10:57.932
Thank you.

10:57.966 --> 10:59.734
The shrimp
is prepared perfectly.

10:59.768 --> 11:01.068
<i>It's very good.</i>

11:01.103 --> 11:02.169
Raymond, please, what is that?

11:02.204 --> 11:03.537
Chef, I made
some homemade raviolis...

11:03.572 --> 11:04.772
Wow.

11:04.806 --> 11:06.040
<i>And I filled it
with three different cheeses.</i>

11:06.074 --> 11:10.177
Homemade ricotta,
queso fresco, and mozzarella.

11:10.212 --> 11:11.779
The sauce is really good.

11:11.813 --> 11:12.880
Thank you.

11:12.914 --> 11:14.348
It's delicious.

11:14.382 --> 11:15.649
Red or blue, please?

11:15.684 --> 11:17.885
I'd have to say I'd go
with the blue team.

11:17.919 --> 11:18.886
<i> Josette.</i>

11:18.920 --> 11:19.887
The red team.

11:19.921 --> 11:20.955
<i>
Red team. Wow.</i>

11:20.989 --> 11:23.457
Jennifer.

11:23.492 --> 11:24.558
I'll go with the blue team.

11:24.593 --> 11:25.726
<i> Another point to blue.</i>

11:25.761 --> 11:26.727
Ray, that's a lovely dish.

11:26.762 --> 11:28.596
<i> Thank you.</i>

11:28.630 --> 11:30.131
I'm telling you, I'm like
the ravioli king here.

11:30.165 --> 11:32.900
This is my day.

11:32.934 --> 11:36.437
Ray has regained
the lead for the blue team.

11:36.471 --> 11:38.105
Next up, battle of the chicken.
Let's go.

11:38.140 --> 11:41.375
And now Anthony has
the chance to clinch the victory.

11:41.409 --> 11:44.011
Today I've made
something very simple.

11:44.045 --> 11:47.081
Something I'd eat with my Nana.
Oh.

11:47.115 --> 11:48.549
<i>It's grilled chicken</i>

11:48.583 --> 11:51.652
underneath is pinto beans
that I've refried.

11:51.686 --> 11:53.020
<i>
The chicken was, like,</i>

11:53.054 --> 11:54.455
really good,
I liked it, tender.

11:54.489 --> 11:56.991
<i>The only thing that I think
that I would fix is, like,</i>

11:57.025 --> 11:58.926
to add a little bit
more flavor to it.

11:58.960 --> 12:01.061
Absolutely.

12:01.096 --> 12:02.563
Brianna, really,
like, you're 15.

12:02.597 --> 12:04.265
What do you know
about the flavor of chicken?

12:04.299 --> 12:05.733
<i> Very well prepared.</i>

12:05.767 --> 12:07.034
Like you said,

12:07.068 --> 12:08.035
it reminds me of something
that we'd have at home.

12:08.069 --> 12:09.103
Overall, very good.

12:09.137 --> 12:10.304
Mary, please present the dish.

12:10.338 --> 12:12.573
I've prepared for you
a butterfly chicken breast

12:12.607 --> 12:16.610
<i>with a lemon cream sauce
and a cauliflower puree.</i>

12:16.645 --> 12:17.878
I like the flavor
that you used,

12:17.913 --> 12:20.948
<i>but I kind of found it
a little too soft.</i>

12:20.982 --> 12:22.950
I love the lemon in it.

12:22.984 --> 12:24.819
Really, really flavorful.

12:24.853 --> 12:27.288
But the sauce has
a little bit too much lemon.

12:27.322 --> 12:30.224
Josette, we'll start with you.

12:30.258 --> 12:31.826
The score right now
is two to one.

12:31.860 --> 12:36.397
We have to get this point or
we're gonna go down in flames.

12:36.431 --> 12:38.699
I'm gonna go with the red team.

12:38.733 --> 12:40.668
Red team. Jennifer.

12:40.702 --> 12:43.370
I'll go with the blue team.

12:43.405 --> 12:44.572
And finally, my darling.

12:44.606 --> 12:47.241
I liked both of them,
they were really good,

12:47.275 --> 12:50.878
<i>but I'd have to go with...</i>

12:52.000 --> 12:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:59.271 --> 13:01.606
In today's Quinceanera
tasting menu challenge,

13:01.640 --> 13:04.142
the blue team is up by one.

13:04.176 --> 13:06.444
I liked both of them,
they were really good.

13:06.479 --> 13:09.614
A vote for Mary's
lemon chicken will tie the score.

13:09.648 --> 13:11.750
But a point for Anthony's
grilled chicken

13:11.784 --> 13:15.420
will seal the victory
for the blue team.

13:15.454 --> 13:17.388
But I'd have to go
with the red team.

13:18.724 --> 13:19.691
<i> Congratulations.
Thank you.</i>

13:19.725 --> 13:20.692
<i> Way to go, Mary.</i>

13:20.726 --> 13:22.827
Good job.
Point to the red team.

13:22.862 --> 13:24.395
Whew, that was close.

13:24.430 --> 13:25.764
<i>All right, girls, come on, now.</i>

13:25.798 --> 13:27.065
We still got a good,
fighting chance here.

13:27.099 --> 13:28.700
We're tied.

13:28.734 --> 13:31.236
<i>It all comes down
to the last dish.</i>

13:31.270 --> 13:32.637
Let's see the steak.

13:32.671 --> 13:34.606
All right, Amanda.
Come on, babe.

13:38.077 --> 13:40.378
I mean, we've won
just one challenge.

13:40.412 --> 13:41.613
We need this so bad.

13:41.647 --> 13:44.682
I made a grilled rib eye

13:44.717 --> 13:47.352
<i>with some spicy chili peppers,</i>

13:47.386 --> 13:50.255
but nothing overpowering.

13:50.289 --> 13:51.556
The flavor was really good.

13:51.590 --> 13:52.724
Thank you.

13:52.758 --> 13:54.559
It was delicious.

13:54.593 --> 13:56.194
Yeah! I'm back!

13:56.228 --> 13:57.996
Michael, please.

13:58.030 --> 13:59.798
Brianna really
enjoyed Amanda's dish,

13:59.832 --> 14:02.033
but my flavors are spot on.

14:02.067 --> 14:03.668
I really don't think
there's any comparison.

14:03.702 --> 14:05.103
Wow.

14:05.137 --> 14:07.038
<i>Is that blood?</i>

14:07.072 --> 14:08.973
Uh, yeah.
Is it raw?

14:09.008 --> 14:12.143
No, chef.

14:12.178 --> 14:14.679
It did taste a little raw.

14:14.713 --> 14:15.680
Damn.

14:15.714 --> 14:17.682
Definitely undercooked.

14:17.716 --> 14:18.716
Mm-hmm. Absolutely right.

14:18.751 --> 14:20.351
Brianna does not
like the undercooked.

14:20.386 --> 14:22.954
Sorry about
the blood on the plate.

14:22.988 --> 14:24.055
I don't even know
what to think anymore.

14:24.089 --> 14:25.890
I guess I can't cook steak.

14:25.925 --> 14:28.960
I give up already.

14:28.994 --> 14:30.128
Prefer the red team
or blue team?

14:30.162 --> 14:32.163
Red team.

14:32.198 --> 14:33.531
Red team, uh, well done.

14:33.566 --> 14:34.599
<i>Another point to the red team.</i>

14:34.633 --> 14:36.100
Thank you.

14:36.135 --> 14:38.236
<i> Congratulations.
Great job.</i>

14:41.507 --> 14:42.807
We were so close.

14:42.842 --> 14:47.712
Just another demoralizing blow
for the blue team.

14:47.746 --> 14:48.813
Jennifer, Josette, and Brianna,

14:48.848 --> 14:50.882
these winning dishes
are going on the menu.

14:50.916 --> 14:52.083
Thank you for your feedback.

14:52.117 --> 14:53.651
I look forward
to seeing you tomorrow. Yeah?

14:53.686 --> 14:54.886
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

14:54.920 --> 14:57.055
Thank you.

14:59.091 --> 15:03.328
Ladies, seven out of eight
challenges.

15:03.362 --> 15:05.964
Total domination.
Great job.

15:05.998 --> 15:08.166
Thank you, chef.

15:08.200 --> 15:11.803
Seeing how we're celebrating
Brianna's 15th birthday,

15:11.837 --> 15:14.973
<i>your reward is all about fun.</i>

15:15.007 --> 15:16.474
<i>I'm sending all of you</i>

15:16.508 --> 15:20.211
to Southern California's
premiere theme park.

15:20.246 --> 15:21.446
Knott's Berry Farm!

15:21.480 --> 15:24.949
Yeah! That's what I wanted!

15:24.984 --> 15:27.418
I'm gonna be in the front row
of every coaster

15:27.453 --> 15:28.920
with my hands way in the air.

15:28.954 --> 15:30.388
Go and become teenagers again.

15:30.422 --> 15:32.857
<i>Yes, chef.
Get changed.</i>

15:32.892 --> 15:34.025
Thank you, chef.

15:34.059 --> 15:35.059
Whoo, Gordon's Angels!

15:36.428 --> 15:38.329
Good job, guys!
Way to go, ladies!

15:38.364 --> 15:41.132
Oh, jeez.

15:42.434 --> 15:43.735
This hurt.

15:43.769 --> 15:45.403
<i> Okay, gentlemen,</i>

15:45.437 --> 15:50.074
you're in for a long day
here in Hell's Kitchen.

15:50.109 --> 15:52.911
You'll be getting the entire
restaurant transformed

15:52.945 --> 15:54.579
<i>for our Quinceanera party.</i>

15:54.613 --> 15:55.947
Oh...

15:55.981 --> 15:56.981
You will be
under the guidance of Josette.

15:57.016 --> 15:58.683
Great.

15:58.717 --> 16:01.653
<i>Setting up all the decorations.</i>

16:01.687 --> 16:03.221
You have an enormous
amount of work ahead of you.

16:03.255 --> 16:07.025
I'm sick of losing,
and now I'm losing it.

16:07.059 --> 16:09.627
I'm gonna go to my safe place.

16:09.662 --> 16:11.930
So first thing is

16:11.964 --> 16:13.531
we need to totally
get ready for transformation.

16:13.565 --> 16:15.266
<i>We need to strip the tables,</i>

16:15.301 --> 16:16.701
all the dinnerware
and everything

16:16.735 --> 16:18.136
needs to be put on the carts.

16:18.170 --> 16:19.537
Yes, Josette!

16:19.571 --> 16:21.539
We gotcha!

16:21.573 --> 16:23.841
Faster we break it down,
the faster we can put it up.

16:25.377 --> 16:26.511
Of course.

16:26.545 --> 16:28.913
Right? It's always
great timing with them.

16:28.948 --> 16:31.482
<i> Nobody's paying attention
to any of the booths on the side.</i>

16:31.517 --> 16:33.117
You really need
to get over there

16:33.152 --> 16:34.118
and start clearing those out.

16:35.921 --> 16:38.156
The boys are getting
their busted

16:38.190 --> 16:39.324
by the party planner.

16:39.358 --> 16:40.525
Chop, chop!

16:40.559 --> 16:41.726
Good luck to you, bitches.

16:41.760 --> 16:43.294
<i> Thank you!</i>

16:43.329 --> 16:44.829
Yay! Knott's Berry Farm!

16:44.863 --> 16:47.298
bitches.

16:54.173 --> 16:55.473
Oh, my God.

16:55.507 --> 16:57.375
I am pumped.

16:57.409 --> 16:58.943
Roller coasters everywhere.

16:58.978 --> 17:01.412
I wanna go on the biggest,
the fastest, and the scariest.

17:03.015 --> 17:04.882
Oh, no.

17:04.916 --> 17:06.951
Somethin' just goes, whoo!

17:06.986 --> 17:08.752
And people scream like...

17:08.787 --> 17:11.255
I am not getting on that.

17:11.290 --> 17:12.656
What about this one?

17:12.691 --> 17:13.790
There's drops on here?

17:13.826 --> 17:14.959
No!

17:14.993 --> 17:16.594
<i> Oh!</i>

17:16.627 --> 17:18.029
Get ready!

17:18.063 --> 17:21.398
I'm gonna kill you bitches!

17:21.433 --> 17:23.667
Here we go, ladies!

17:31.577 --> 17:34.045
While the women
experience the thrill of victory,

17:34.079 --> 17:35.546
the men face the agony of...

17:35.581 --> 17:37.281
<i> Each of you are
gonna take a doll to dress.</i>

17:37.316 --> 17:38.616
Decorating.

17:38.650 --> 17:41.819
You need to cut
18 pieces of pink tulle,

17:41.854 --> 17:43.955
20 inches long, for each doll.

17:43.989 --> 17:45.323
I feel like a tool.

17:45.357 --> 17:47.258
I've never put dolls together.

17:47.292 --> 17:50.895
It wasn't, like, one of my
MOSs in the marine corps.

17:50.929 --> 17:52.397
"Here, you're gonna
clean this cannon,

17:52.431 --> 17:54.465
and you're gonna make
these little, Spanish dolls."

17:55.601 --> 17:56.701
Dude, I got glitter
all over me.

17:58.137 --> 18:00.538
Maybe I can glue some
of my manhood back together.

18:00.572 --> 18:01.939
<i> Good luck with that.</i>

18:01.974 --> 18:03.374
<i> You don't have
enough glue, Barrettt.</i>

18:05.010 --> 18:06.177
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

18:06.211 --> 18:07.445
Shut up!

18:07.479 --> 18:08.546
<i> How fitting.</i>

18:08.580 --> 18:09.547
Who's going first?

18:09.581 --> 18:11.382
I'll go.
Amanda, go.

18:11.417 --> 18:12.617
<i> Get the real clown.
Get him right in the head.</i>

18:12.651 --> 18:14.085
What's that?
You wanna talk some?

18:14.119 --> 18:16.187
Eat this. Unh.

18:18.824 --> 18:20.758
<i> Come on, Suzy.</i>

18:22.161 --> 18:23.227
Thank you very much, gentlemen.

18:25.431 --> 18:29.467
You guys are
a bunch of suckers.

18:32.504 --> 18:33.905
How we doing?

18:33.939 --> 18:35.306
Uh, chippin' away at it.

18:35.340 --> 18:37.075
On this one,

18:37.109 --> 18:38.276
<i>the bow needs to be redone</i>

18:38.310 --> 18:39.811
so that the shiny side is out.

18:39.845 --> 18:41.212
Okay.

18:43.415 --> 18:46.084
Right now it's like
a bunch of psychotics

18:46.118 --> 18:47.452
setting up this birthday party.

18:47.486 --> 18:48.920
Because Josette's crazy,
you know.

18:48.954 --> 18:50.455
She's the event planner.
Everything's gotta be perfect.

18:50.489 --> 18:53.558
All these in the back
all have the flat side out.

18:53.592 --> 18:55.760
So the back row
needs to be redone.

18:55.794 --> 18:58.096
Oh,.
I'm gonna go ballistic.

18:58.130 --> 19:00.731
We're on our last
nerve with this party planner.

19:00.766 --> 19:02.200
We're just spiraling down.

19:02.234 --> 19:04.735
Oh, my God, this is gonna
take nine more hours.

19:04.770 --> 19:05.837
Let's just get moving
on the chairs

19:05.871 --> 19:07.038
so that the chairs
can get dressed.

19:07.072 --> 19:08.706
I'm going as fast
as I can with these.

19:08.740 --> 19:10.074
<i>We really need to hurry up</i>

19:10.109 --> 19:11.342
'cause we've got a lot
of other stuff to do.

19:11.376 --> 19:12.577
Oh, my God.

19:12.611 --> 19:13.811
<i>
I really need these done.</i>

19:13.846 --> 19:16.080
You know what,
this place.

19:16.115 --> 19:17.682
I wanna get the
outta here.

19:25.919 --> 19:27.620
After losing their
seventh challenge out of eight,

19:27.654 --> 19:30.322
the men are spending
a grueling day

19:30.357 --> 19:31.724
with the Quinceanera
party planner.

19:31.758 --> 19:33.092
<i> We really
need to hurry up,</i>

19:33.126 --> 19:34.593
'cause we've got a lot
of other stuff to do.

19:34.628 --> 19:37.196
And Barrettt is
on the verge of losing it.

19:37.230 --> 19:39.098
<i>
I really need these done.</i>

19:39.132 --> 19:40.466
<i> You know what?
.</i>

19:40.500 --> 19:41.467
Barrettt!

19:41.501 --> 19:42.568
<i>Relax.</i>

19:42.602 --> 19:45.938
Dude, seriously.

19:45.972 --> 19:47.573
Don't worry,
I'm not gonna flip out, man!

19:52.179 --> 19:53.479
Here they come.

19:53.513 --> 19:55.981
<i>Be proud of what
you've done, men.</i>

19:56.016 --> 19:59.085
Wow!

19:59.119 --> 20:01.654
<i> There's a candy bar!</i>

20:01.688 --> 20:04.056
You guys wanna help
unwrap candy by hand?

20:04.091 --> 20:05.925
No, thank you.

20:05.959 --> 20:08.828
<i> It's so hard being
so good at winning.</i>

20:10.030 --> 20:12.698
Suckas! My God.

20:12.732 --> 20:15.301
My hands are gonna be
really sore after this.

20:15.335 --> 20:16.602
When does the punishment stop?

20:16.636 --> 20:17.703
<i> When you die.</i>

20:17.737 --> 20:20.940
<i> Yeah.</i>

20:20.974 --> 20:22.942
Tonight, for the first time,

20:22.976 --> 20:25.344
Hell's Kitchen
is hosting a Quinceanera.

20:25.378 --> 20:26.812
Let's do it.

20:26.847 --> 20:29.281
And both teams
are anxious to get to work

20:29.316 --> 20:31.050
prepping for tonight's
special occasion.

20:31.084 --> 20:32.051
We're gonna kill it.

20:32.085 --> 20:33.486
Whew.

20:33.520 --> 20:34.920
You all right?

20:34.955 --> 20:36.755
<i> My nerves are
going a little bit.</i>

20:36.790 --> 20:38.324
I'm concerned about Amanda.

20:38.358 --> 20:40.025
I hope she can keep
her head in the game

20:40.060 --> 20:42.027
so that we can have
a successful service.

20:42.062 --> 20:43.129
No pressure.

20:43.163 --> 20:44.330
I'm looking out
into the dining room,

20:44.364 --> 20:47.733
and I'm just amazed
of the job that we did.

20:47.767 --> 20:50.436
I'm ready to knock this
dinner service out the ballpark.

20:50.470 --> 20:53.339
Start sprinklin',
start sprinklin'.

20:58.912 --> 21:00.479
Okay.

21:00.514 --> 21:02.815
<i>Tonight we are opening
our doors for our first ever</i>

21:02.849 --> 21:04.016
Quinceanera.

21:04.050 --> 21:05.384
<i>Celebrations like this</i>

21:05.418 --> 21:07.086
only come once in a lifetime.

21:07.120 --> 21:08.320
Yes, chef.

21:08.355 --> 21:11.056
All the appetizers
must go out like clockwork.

21:11.091 --> 21:12.191
<i>Because at the end
of the appetizers,</i>

21:12.225 --> 21:14.260
there's a very important waltz.

21:14.294 --> 21:15.261
<i>Clear?</i>

21:15.295 --> 21:16.896
Yes, chef.

21:16.930 --> 21:18.430
Good.
How should the kitchen run?

21:18.465 --> 21:19.565
Clockwork!

21:19.599 --> 21:21.367
Let's go, guys.
Let's make some history.

21:21.401 --> 21:24.103
Okay, Jean-Philippe,
open Hell's Kitchen, please.

21:24.137 --> 21:25.104
<i>And welcome our guests,
thank you.</i>

21:25.138 --> 21:27.406
<i>Oui, chef.
Let's go.</i>

21:40.120 --> 21:41.287
We're not going down.

21:41.321 --> 21:42.755
We're pushing tonight, chef.

21:42.789 --> 21:43.889
<i> You're pushing
tonight, are you?</i>

21:43.924 --> 21:45.357
Zach's pushing tonight,
by the way.

21:45.392 --> 21:46.692
<i>
Yes, you better believe it.</i>

21:46.726 --> 21:47.893
Yeah? Good.

21:47.928 --> 21:52.231
I can't let her down.
I know. I... oh.

21:52.265 --> 21:57.536
<i>Senoras y senores,
all rise for la Quinceanera.</i>

21:57.571 --> 22:00.005
<i>Brianna Rojas...</i>

22:00.040 --> 22:03.809
<i>And her escort...
Eros Soanz.</i>

22:03.843 --> 22:05.511
<i> She looks gorgeous.</i>

22:05.545 --> 22:07.713
I know.

22:07.747 --> 22:09.882
<i>Aww!</i>

22:09.916 --> 22:12.218
<i> Okay, let's go.
Stations, let's go.</i>

22:12.252 --> 22:13.419
Man up.

22:13.453 --> 22:14.520
We got this.

22:14.554 --> 22:16.288
Tonight's menu

22:16.323 --> 22:18.290
includes the winning dishes
from yesterday's challenge.

22:18.325 --> 22:19.525
Chicken.
The chicken?

22:19.559 --> 22:21.727
Chef Ramsay has both kitchens

22:21.761 --> 22:23.662
working together
to deliver appetizers

22:23.697 --> 22:24.797
to the head table.

22:24.831 --> 22:27.032
Okay, top table, here we go.

22:27.067 --> 22:28.434
Three ceviche, two ravioli,
one Caesar salad.

22:28.468 --> 22:30.035
Yes, chef!
Let's go!

22:30.070 --> 22:32.271
<i>Yes, chef.
Okay, top table.</i>

22:32.305 --> 22:34.406
Here we go. Fire two Caesar,
three tuna, one ravioli.

22:34.441 --> 22:35.841
Yes, chef!
Are you guys good?

22:35.875 --> 22:37.409
<i>You know what you're doing?
Yes!</i>

22:37.444 --> 22:38.744
<i>Three tuna, two Caesar.</i>

22:38.778 --> 22:41.046
Three tuna?

22:41.081 --> 22:43.482
The first table, red and blue
got to split the apps.

22:43.516 --> 22:45.651
Tuna's going in the pan, girls.

22:45.685 --> 22:47.953
We gotta be on the money.

22:47.988 --> 22:50.122
Ladies, ravioli's out!

22:50.156 --> 22:51.357
Let's go, ladies.
Pick it up.

22:51.391 --> 22:53.192
Yes, chef!
I'm slicing.

22:53.226 --> 22:54.260
<i>
Move! Let's go!</i>

22:54.294 --> 22:55.995
Ravioli's here, chef.

22:56.029 --> 22:58.264
Let's go.
Amanda, wake up, please!

22:58.298 --> 23:01.467
<i>It's not working!
Come on, please!</i>

23:01.501 --> 23:05.738
Bring the tuna now!

23:05.772 --> 23:07.806
Where's the noodles gone?
I got 'em right here.

23:09.042 --> 23:11.110
These are broken.

23:11.144 --> 23:13.245
Why is all this tuna broken?

23:13.280 --> 23:14.313
<i>Hey. Hey, look at
this one here.</i>

23:14.347 --> 23:16.849
Look, look, look.
Oh, God.

23:18.151 --> 23:20.386
Come on, Amanda!
Get your together!

23:20.420 --> 23:21.854
Come on then, Amanda!

23:21.888 --> 23:24.290
I'm sorry, chef. I'll get one
in the pan right now.

23:24.324 --> 23:26.525
<i> hell!
Need that tuna.</i>

23:26.559 --> 23:28.460
<i>Yeah, she's
butchered it.</i>

23:28.495 --> 23:30.996
While Amanda
starts over on the tuna,

23:31.031 --> 23:34.099
over in the blue kitchen,
it's up to Anthony and Jon

23:34.134 --> 23:36.935
to finish the blue team's share
of the head table appetizers.

23:36.970 --> 23:38.103
Come on!
Where's the drive?

23:38.138 --> 23:39.638
<i>Yes, chef!
Working, chef.</i>

23:39.673 --> 23:41.540
Three ceviche, two ravioli,
and a Caesar first.

23:41.574 --> 23:42.808
Here. Let me...
let me do these.

23:42.842 --> 23:43.942
Dude, dude, come on, man.

23:43.977 --> 23:45.444
Like, too many people
on my team.

23:45.478 --> 23:47.313
Ray, Ray.
Go talk. Go talk.

23:47.347 --> 23:48.714
Thank you.
Thank you, we're good.

23:48.748 --> 23:50.949
Come on, Ray, let's go!
Yes, chef.

23:50.984 --> 23:52.751
Working it. All set with
this one. Walking up.

23:52.786 --> 23:53.886
<i>Go!
Let's go!</i>

23:53.920 --> 23:56.155
Good.

23:56.189 --> 23:58.724
Guys, let me help you
with the apps, please.

23:58.758 --> 24:00.392
Ray, we're good.
You're good?

24:00.427 --> 24:01.393
Yes.
All right.

24:01.428 --> 24:03.362
Thank you.
Yep.

24:03.396 --> 24:04.897
<i>
Okay. Off you go, yes?</i>

24:04.931 --> 24:08.334
Ladies, I've sent blue team's
top table. Let's go.

24:08.368 --> 24:10.769
<i>Amanda, where's the tuna?
Right here, chef!</i>

24:10.804 --> 24:12.738
<i>Let's go, Amanda.
Let's go!</i>

24:12.772 --> 24:14.807
<i> Behind you!</i>

24:18.445 --> 24:20.813
Let's go. Go with that tuna,
please, quickly.

24:20.847 --> 24:22.281
<i>Top table, let's go.</i>

24:22.315 --> 24:24.350
Amanda's tuna
finally makes its way

24:24.384 --> 24:25.684
out to the dining room,

24:25.719 --> 24:27.353
and the head table's appetizers
are complete.

24:27.387 --> 24:28.954
Thank you.

24:28.988 --> 24:31.123
And the Quinceanera
is off to a reasonable start.

24:31.157 --> 24:33.792
Okay.
Service, please.

24:33.827 --> 24:35.761
<i> Six covers, table 21.</i>

24:35.795 --> 24:37.496
Two ceviche, two ravioli,
two tuna.

24:37.530 --> 24:39.865
<i>Yes, chef!
Let's go!</i>

24:39.899 --> 24:40.866
Amanda, get it together!

24:40.900 --> 24:42.835
Yes, chef!
One minute!

24:42.869 --> 24:45.804
You need something, Amanda?
No.

24:45.839 --> 24:48.040
"I got it, I got it!"
No, you don't.

24:48.074 --> 24:50.709
Man, I'm going right over there
right now to help her out.

24:50.744 --> 24:53.846
While Nedra pitches
in to keep the red team on track,

24:53.880 --> 24:55.914
over in the blue kitchen...
Go.

24:55.949 --> 24:58.584
Thanks to great
teamwork from Jon and Anthony...

24:58.618 --> 25:00.319
Chef, on your right.
Service, please.

25:00.353 --> 25:02.187
A steady stream of appetizers

25:02.222 --> 25:03.822
are making their way out
to the dining room.

25:03.857 --> 25:06.525
Madam is having the raviolis?

25:06.559 --> 25:08.794
Behind you, chef.
Nice!

25:08.828 --> 25:11.330
<i> Let's go. Service, please.
Let's go, please.</i>

25:11.364 --> 25:13.198
All right, that's it.
That's it on apps.

25:13.233 --> 25:14.400
That's not nice.

25:14.434 --> 25:18.003
Anthony, I love you, man.
Yeah.

25:18.037 --> 25:21.106
While the blue team is
busy congratulating themselves,

25:21.141 --> 25:24.410
over in the red kitchen,
Amanda's struggle with the tuna

25:24.444 --> 25:26.044
has her team
playing catch-up.

25:26.079 --> 25:27.846
<i> Ladies!
Yes, chef!</i>

25:27.881 --> 25:30.082
The blue team have finished.
We're two tickets behind!

25:30.116 --> 25:31.884
Yes, chef!
Oh, my God.

25:31.918 --> 25:34.520
<i>Coming right now!
Here's the tuna.</i>

25:35.922 --> 25:39.358
You are kidding me.
It's ice cold.

25:39.392 --> 25:41.427
Hey, all of you,
come here. Hurry up!

25:42.562 --> 25:44.696
Just touch that.
Touch that with your fingers.

25:44.731 --> 25:46.732
Stone cold.
Sto... it's ice cold!

25:46.766 --> 25:48.901
<i>!
Something so easy!</i>

25:48.935 --> 25:53.472
Who seared it?
Nedra seared it.

25:53.506 --> 25:57.009
it, Amanda.
You skating on thin ice!

25:57.043 --> 26:00.879
That's not the one I seared.
hell.

26:00.914 --> 26:02.114
<i>I just don't know where to go.</i>

26:02.148 --> 26:05.617
A piece of fish that big
that can't be seared!

26:06.886 --> 26:09.621
Chef, I did not take it
out of the pan, chef!

26:09.656 --> 26:11.790
Nedra seared it, chef.
I got it.

26:11.825 --> 26:14.593
<i>"Nedra seared it. I got it."
That's not the one I seared.</i>

26:14.627 --> 26:16.595
Back off the station!
I have it!

26:16.629 --> 26:18.864
Chef, it was a poor mistake.
I'm trying to fix it right now.

26:18.898 --> 26:21.767
bitch.

26:21.801 --> 26:24.169
It's almost an
hour into dinner service,

26:24.204 --> 26:26.572
and the red team's backlog
on appetizers

26:26.606 --> 26:30.309
has left some of the partygoers
without food...

26:30.343 --> 26:34.246
And put the guest of honor
and the entire party on hold,

26:34.280 --> 26:37.716
as she waits to perform the
traditional Quinceanera waltz.

26:37.750 --> 26:39.485
Chef Ramsay, we still have
two tables that haven't eaten.

26:39.519 --> 26:40.652
They're just coming now,
my darling.

26:40.687 --> 26:41.720
Bear with me two seconds,
please.

26:41.754 --> 26:43.121
We're almost done
with our food.

26:43.156 --> 26:44.456
We need to have
the other tables out.

26:44.491 --> 26:45.791
<i>They're not even seasoned.
Just cook 'em!</i>

26:45.825 --> 26:47.426
We gotta get 'em up. Come on!
You gave it to me!

26:47.460 --> 26:49.862
Come on, guys!
Half the dining room finished!

26:49.896 --> 26:51.997
Hey, guys, don't... don't... don't
let us down, please, yeah?

26:52.031 --> 26:53.799
We need to start the waltz
here tonight, yeah?

26:53.833 --> 26:56.201
Everybody else is finished!
It's coming right now!

26:56.236 --> 26:58.270
I need a minute!
Come on, now.

26:58.304 --> 27:01.306
Let's go!
Here! me!

27:01.341 --> 27:03.709
Oh, my G...
Are you kidding me?

27:03.743 --> 27:06.044
Take control of your station,
Amanda.

27:06.079 --> 27:07.846
She bumped into me, chef.

27:07.881 --> 27:09.848
Chef, I can't hold them
anymore.

27:09.883 --> 27:12.818
This is an absolute joke!

27:18.902 --> 27:22.104
Hell's Kitchen is
hosting its first ever Quinceanera.

27:22.139 --> 27:23.639
We need to start
the waltz here tonight.

27:23.674 --> 27:25.274
Everybody else is finished!

27:25.309 --> 27:28.377
Unfortunately,
Amanda's inability to sear tuna...

27:28.412 --> 27:29.545
I need a minute!

27:29.579 --> 27:31.213
And to get along with Nedra...

27:31.248 --> 27:34.016
Let's go!
Here! me!

27:34.051 --> 27:37.153
Oh, my G...

27:37.187 --> 27:38.721
Has left some diners hungry

27:38.755 --> 27:41.057
and Brianna waiting
to perform her waltz.

27:41.091 --> 27:43.793
She bumped into me, chef.
Hey, who's searing it?

27:43.827 --> 27:47.830
She took over searing.
I'm gonna take it over.

27:47.864 --> 27:50.232
Who is in charge?
I'm in charge, chef!

27:50.267 --> 27:51.701
Tell her, then!
I'm in charge!

27:51.735 --> 27:54.470
All right, get your tuna.

27:56.340 --> 27:57.573
If you don't want my help,

27:57.607 --> 27:58.774
I ain't gonna
give it to you.

27:58.809 --> 28:00.276
Figure it out on your own.

28:00.310 --> 28:02.278
<i> What the
is going on there?</i>

28:02.312 --> 28:04.146
I don't know, chef.
Look at that.

28:04.181 --> 28:06.349
<i>This is extraordinary!</i>

28:06.383 --> 28:09.385
It's not...
it's not my fault.

28:09.419 --> 28:11.620
<i> Chef, I
can't hold them anymore.</i>

28:11.655 --> 28:13.022
They need... they need to
start dancing, chef.

28:13.056 --> 28:14.223
Oh, hell.

28:14.257 --> 28:15.458
Move, move, move, move, move.

28:15.492 --> 28:16.726
This cannot be real.

28:16.760 --> 28:18.127
<i> It's coming right now!</i>

28:18.161 --> 28:20.396
<i>Senoras y senores,</i>

28:20.430 --> 28:23.432
<i>the court will now perform
the waltz.</i>

28:30.040 --> 28:32.441
*

28:32.476 --> 28:34.210
<i>
They've started the waltz.</i>

28:34.244 --> 28:36.379
<i>I've never seen individuals</i>

28:36.413 --> 28:39.815
screw the easiest
appetizers in the world!

28:39.850 --> 28:42.051
I'm more embarrassed
than you are, trust me.

28:42.085 --> 28:43.252
<i> Oh, please.</i>

28:43.286 --> 28:45.154
<i>Sorry. I'm sorry,
Oh, off.</i>

28:45.188 --> 28:48.591
off.
Hey, off.

28:48.625 --> 28:49.992
<i> off!</i>

28:50.027 --> 28:53.162
Do I need to drop
another ravioli?

28:53.196 --> 28:57.867
Hey. Hey, all of you, come here.
Hey. Waltz has started.

28:57.901 --> 29:01.237
Hurry up!
Look and speed it up!

29:01.271 --> 29:04.807
You guys are moving slower
than the waltz!

29:04.841 --> 29:06.976
Yes, chef.

29:07.010 --> 29:10.012
Entrees are firing now.
Top table first.

29:10.047 --> 29:11.781
It has to go together.
Yes, chef.

29:11.815 --> 29:14.250
What is difficult here?
Nothing, chef.

29:14.284 --> 29:16.052
Blue team, away now.

29:16.086 --> 29:18.220
Two salmon, two rib eye, one
chicken, one linguini. Yes, chef!

29:18.255 --> 29:20.022
Red team, two linguini,
two chicken,

29:20.057 --> 29:21.824
one rib eye, one salmon.
Yes, chef!

29:21.858 --> 29:23.225
Hey, blue team!
Yes, chef?

29:23.260 --> 29:25.895
<i>I want it in six minutes.
You got it, chef.</i>

29:25.929 --> 29:28.164
Get some momentum. Move!
Yes, chef!

29:28.198 --> 29:29.432
Thanks to the red team,

29:29.466 --> 29:31.600
chef Ramsay is pissed off.

29:31.635 --> 29:33.569
We really need to be
on our game,

29:33.603 --> 29:35.604
because that anger is just
gonna be multiplied by ten

29:35.639 --> 29:37.073
if we start up.

29:37.107 --> 29:39.608
<i> Garnish to the window.
Let's go!</i>

29:39.643 --> 29:41.744
I'm ready. Beautiful!
Hot behind you, gentlemen.

29:41.778 --> 29:44.313
Put it down.

29:44.347 --> 29:46.916
Hey, I want more potatoes!

29:46.950 --> 29:49.585
Look what I've got.
Look. Substantial!

29:49.619 --> 29:52.354
Yes, chef!
Get some more potatoes on!

29:52.389 --> 29:53.689
<i>We've got to go!
Yes, chef!</i>

29:53.723 --> 29:55.958
More potatoes, please.
Heard that.

29:55.992 --> 29:59.195
Jon and Anthony really
killed it on apps tonight.

29:59.229 --> 30:01.497
We're off to a great start,
but it's not how you start,

30:01.531 --> 30:03.165
it's how you finish.

30:03.200 --> 30:05.201
Potatoes!
Yes, chef!

30:05.235 --> 30:06.469
<i> Move, Zach.
Yes, chef!</i>

30:06.503 --> 30:08.971
Barrett, you about to go up
on that first ticket?

30:09.005 --> 30:11.707
Yeah. Yeah, this is going.
Go for it.

30:11.741 --> 30:12.775
<i> linguini, where is it?</i>

30:12.809 --> 30:13.909
Pasta.
Leave it down at the end.

30:13.944 --> 30:15.811
Okay. Behind.

30:21.885 --> 30:24.787
Hey, hey, time-out.
All of you!

30:24.821 --> 30:26.355
<i>Yeah, it's not good.</i>

30:26.389 --> 30:28.324
Yeah, no, hold on,
hold on. Uh, hey, hey.

30:28.358 --> 30:29.525
I want you to taste that.

30:29.559 --> 30:31.193
I want... I want you
to taste it.

30:31.228 --> 30:32.261
<i>Hey, no, no, hey.</i>

30:32.295 --> 30:33.896
Just taste it.
Get in there!

30:33.930 --> 30:36.098
<i>Get in, you!
Get in, get in, get in!</i>

30:36.133 --> 30:37.666
<i>Taste it.
Just taste it.</i>

30:37.701 --> 30:41.003
<i>Crunchy linguini.
No spinach.</i>

30:41.037 --> 30:43.239
And look at that.
The oil slick. Look.

30:43.273 --> 30:45.174
I'll fix... I'll fix it, chef.
I'll fix it right now.

30:45.208 --> 30:47.843
<i>I'll fix it right now.
Oh, come on, guys.</i>

30:47.878 --> 30:49.512
Zach, look at that!

30:49.546 --> 30:50.546
I know it looks
like, chef!

30:50.580 --> 30:52.248
You me
on the garnish as well!

30:52.282 --> 30:53.682
<i>Little portions.</i>

30:53.717 --> 30:55.651
<i>Linguini, let's go!</i>

30:55.685 --> 30:58.187
I'm ready, I'm ready.
Behind, behind.

30:58.221 --> 31:01.490
Behind.
Here you go, chef.

31:01.525 --> 31:03.225
<i> Service, please.</i>

31:03.260 --> 31:04.727
Sorry, Jon.
All right, guys.

31:04.761 --> 31:06.695
<i>Two linguini, two salmon,
two chicken. Let's go!</i>

31:06.730 --> 31:08.864
Bounce back,.
Bounce back!

31:08.899 --> 31:11.767
With Barrett bouncing back,

31:11.801 --> 31:14.136
entrees are now leaving
the blue kitchen.

31:14.171 --> 31:16.105
The food is delicious.

31:16.139 --> 31:17.239
<i> It's so good.</i>

31:17.274 --> 31:19.341
And back in the red kitchen,

31:19.376 --> 31:20.843
it's up to Nedra
on the meat station

31:20.877 --> 31:22.244
to make sure her team keeps up.

31:22.279 --> 31:24.780
Are we ready?
Give me one minute on chicken.

31:24.814 --> 31:26.015
Let's go!

31:26.049 --> 31:28.984
The appetizers
were so up,

31:29.019 --> 31:30.653
but I'm on the meat station
tonight.

31:30.687 --> 31:33.656
We should have this one
in the bag.

31:33.690 --> 31:35.257
What the is that?

31:35.292 --> 31:39.995
Hey, all of you!
All of you, urgently!

31:40.030 --> 31:41.397
me!

31:41.431 --> 31:43.432
Look at that.
Touch how dry that is.

31:43.466 --> 31:45.568
Who cooked that?
I did, chef.

31:45.602 --> 31:47.770
I got one right here.
I'll give it to you right now.

31:47.804 --> 31:48.804
<i>I'm sorry, chef.</i>

31:50.789 --> 31:51.874
<i> Come on.</i>

31:51.908 --> 31:53.742
Get it together, Nedra, please?

31:53.777 --> 31:56.278
Here you go. Walking right now
with another chicken.

31:56.313 --> 31:57.913
<i>Okay.</i>

31:57.948 --> 32:01.850
Hey, you.
Come here, you.

32:01.885 --> 32:04.820
I'm not in the mood for
any more dry chicken.

32:04.854 --> 32:07.323
<i>Yes, chef.
However, this one's perfect.</i>

32:07.357 --> 32:09.358
Yes, chef.

32:09.392 --> 32:12.394
Go. Service, please.
Let's go.

32:12.429 --> 32:14.830
Now that Nedra's
moist and delicious chicken

32:14.864 --> 32:16.899
has completed the order
for the head table...

32:16.933 --> 32:18.067
Thank you for your patience.

32:18.101 --> 32:19.068
The red team...

32:19.102 --> 32:20.603
Go.
Rib eye.

32:20.637 --> 32:22.304
And the blue team...
Go, Jon.

32:22.339 --> 32:25.541
Are sending entrees out
to the rest of the dining room.

32:25.575 --> 32:27.243
<i> This is good, isn't it?
Mmm!</i>

32:27.277 --> 32:30.346
But in the blue
kitchen, chef Ramsay...

32:30.380 --> 32:31.680
Two rib eye. You have
potatoes for one there.

32:31.715 --> 32:32.715
Has a complaint

32:32.749 --> 32:34.683
that is sounding
a little familiar.

32:34.718 --> 32:37.720
I've got two rib eyes, Zach, and
I've got one portion. Yes, chef.

32:37.754 --> 32:39.455
I told you,
get lots of potatoes on!

32:39.489 --> 32:42.658
I gave him some already.
Calm down.

32:42.692 --> 32:43.659
<i>Hey. Hey, smartass.
Yes, chef.</i>

32:43.693 --> 32:44.760
<i>Yes, chef.
Come here, you.</i>

32:44.794 --> 32:46.295
Why does it take you
four times to understand?

32:46.329 --> 32:47.396
It doesn't, chef.
Look at me.

32:47.430 --> 32:48.497
It doesn't, chef.

32:48.531 --> 32:49.632
So when you
get told to do it,

32:49.666 --> 32:50.633
why don't you do it then?

32:50.667 --> 32:51.967
I- I made a mistake, chef.

32:52.002 --> 32:54.270
It won't happen again.
You see, I'm on it.

32:54.304 --> 32:56.372
Chef, you don't gotta bark!
Chill!

32:57.641 --> 32:59.575
He's always...

32:59.609 --> 33:01.043
relax, dude.

33:01.077 --> 33:02.111
Get this guy
a big pan and show him.

33:02.145 --> 33:03.145
You're just
killing us for nothing!

33:03.179 --> 33:04.580
No, I'm not killing us, chef!

33:04.614 --> 33:05.881
<i> Get the
potatoes on then!</i>

33:05.915 --> 33:07.082
<i>Look at me! Yes, chef.
Not a problem, chef.</i>

33:07.117 --> 33:08.250
There's the potatoes, okay?

33:08.285 --> 33:10.152
Three times.
"Get the potatoes on."

33:10.186 --> 33:11.654
"Oh, chef, I'm gonna
work hard tonight."

33:11.688 --> 33:13.822
you, Zach!
Yes, chef!

33:13.857 --> 33:15.391
Next time,
you're history!

33:15.425 --> 33:17.660
Yes, chef!

33:20.330 --> 33:23.232
While Zach longs
for chef Ramsay's approval,

33:23.266 --> 33:25.334
<i>both the red team...
Last ticket!</i>

33:25.368 --> 33:27.503
<i>Let's get these
entrees out, guys!</i>

33:27.537 --> 33:29.104
And the blue team...
Let's go, please.

33:29.139 --> 33:30.906
Move on to their last ticket.

33:30.940 --> 33:33.108
Two linguini, two salmon,
two chicken.

33:33.143 --> 33:35.311
30 seconds, chef!

33:35.345 --> 33:37.279
The service started out bumpy,

33:37.314 --> 33:38.314
with the first pasta
coming back,

33:38.348 --> 33:39.581
but I finished strong.

33:39.616 --> 33:40.616
I fight back.

33:40.650 --> 33:42.051
Two linguini.

33:44.888 --> 33:49.124
All of you!
Hey, everybody, over here!

33:49.159 --> 33:51.427
Let's go.

33:51.461 --> 33:53.429
Hey, look, look, look.
Look what I get. Look.

33:56.333 --> 33:58.734
Yeah, that's
a charred stick

33:58.768 --> 33:59.968
in a piece of rubber bullet.

34:00.003 --> 34:01.136
Oh,.

34:01.171 --> 34:03.672
What are you doing?
I'll put more in.

34:03.707 --> 34:05.874
It's got a black piece
of cinder in there.!

34:05.909 --> 34:07.376
<i>Hey, blue team!
Yes, chef!</i>

34:07.410 --> 34:10.545
We're gonna be in the!

34:10.580 --> 34:12.114
Come on!

34:17.860 --> 34:19.360
It's nearly two hours

34:19.395 --> 34:21.329
into the Hell's Kitchen
Quinceanera,

34:21.362 --> 34:23.731
and two tables are still waiting
for their entrees.

34:23.766 --> 34:24.833
<i> Two tables
that haven't eaten yet.</i>

34:24.867 --> 34:25.967
Wow.

34:26.001 --> 34:27.569
I just want those tables
to get fed.

34:27.603 --> 34:29.204
Over here.

34:29.237 --> 34:30.505
And thanks to
Barrett in the blue kitchen,

34:30.539 --> 34:32.540
the wait
has just gotten longer.

34:32.574 --> 34:35.409
Oh,.
What are you doing?

34:35.444 --> 34:38.379
I'll put more in. It's got a black
piece of cinder in there.!

34:38.414 --> 34:41.049
I want two linguini urgently!
With new shrimp. Yes, chef.

34:41.083 --> 34:42.382
One minute to the pan, chef.

34:42.418 --> 34:44.918
Last ticket, and he's
letting you down.

34:44.954 --> 34:47.088
Guys, I'm not letting nobody down.
All right, good.

34:47.121 --> 34:48.790
Then you better
have it, Barrett.

34:48.824 --> 34:50.992
<i> More flavor?
I'll give you flavor.</i>

34:51.025 --> 34:53.261
Pasta. How could I
up pasta?

34:53.295 --> 34:55.496
I'm gonna slap myself
in the face

34:55.531 --> 34:57.432
for the next two years because
of this pasta.

34:57.466 --> 34:58.566
I got it.
Come on.

34:58.601 --> 35:00.101
Yes.

35:02.371 --> 35:05.173
Service, please.
Let's go.

35:05.207 --> 35:07.375
With the men
completing their last ticket...

35:09.812 --> 35:12.213
Hurry up! Coming up, right
behind, right behind!

35:12.248 --> 35:14.649
The only thing
standing between chef Ramsay

35:14.683 --> 35:16.718
and a complete dinner service
is...

35:16.752 --> 35:19.921
<i>Two rib eye.
There you go, chef.</i>

35:19.955 --> 35:21.856
Oh, my God.

35:21.891 --> 35:24.526
Yeah, all of you!

35:24.560 --> 35:27.128
Who cooked that?
That is me, chef.

35:27.162 --> 35:30.832
This rib eye has still got
his horns on!

35:30.866 --> 35:31.833
I have two in the oven
right now, chef.

35:31.867 --> 35:32.901
I'll bring 'em right now.

35:32.935 --> 35:34.869
How about sending me
the perfect one?

35:34.904 --> 35:36.137
<i>Yes, chef.
Yes, chef.</i>

35:36.171 --> 35:38.673
Please!
She can't cook!

35:38.707 --> 35:40.975
And you're on fire!

35:43.779 --> 35:45.547
Could this
night get any worse?

35:47.516 --> 35:48.616
<i>Rib eye!
Let's go!</i>

35:48.651 --> 35:49.951
<i>Chicken's ready, getting dry!</i>

35:49.985 --> 35:51.119
Rib eye, chef.

35:51.153 --> 35:53.154
Yeah?

35:58.694 --> 35:59.827
Finally.

35:59.862 --> 36:01.529
Service, please.

36:04.767 --> 36:06.668
I'm really disappointed.

36:06.769 --> 36:09.469
I wanted this to be
a memorable

36:09.572 --> 36:11.706
enchanting night
for Brianna, but instead,

36:11.740 --> 36:14.309
we really
sucked tonight.

36:18.447 --> 36:22.550
Tonight, we hosted
a special event.

36:22.585 --> 36:23.952
<i>Yes, it was special, all right.</i>

36:23.986 --> 36:26.087
Especially painful.

36:26.121 --> 36:28.104
The losing team tonight...

36:29.959 --> 36:33.528
The red.

36:33.562 --> 36:35.330
And the blue.

36:35.364 --> 36:36.397
<i>Do you know why?</i>

36:36.432 --> 36:39.000
That was embarrassing.

36:39.034 --> 36:42.737
Both teams, nominate
your two weakest chefs

36:42.771 --> 36:44.606
from tonight's service.

36:44.640 --> 36:47.875
Piss off!

36:47.910 --> 36:50.778
I am pretty pissed off
about the Quinceanera.

36:50.813 --> 36:52.380
The blue team
had a lot of chances

36:52.414 --> 36:54.449
to win the service tonight,
and we didn't.

36:54.483 --> 36:58.486
It all just came crashing down
again.

36:58.520 --> 36:59.654
So who's your two, Jon?

36:59.688 --> 37:02.290
Based on just who got
yelled at the most,

37:02.324 --> 37:06.194
who I'd have to say
is you and Barrett.

37:06.228 --> 37:07.428
Yep.

37:07.463 --> 37:08.930
I cannot believe it.

37:08.964 --> 37:10.865
All the points that I got
for my blue team

37:10.899 --> 37:12.000
when we were
in those challenges

37:12.034 --> 37:13.701
don't mean a thing
right now.

37:13.736 --> 37:17.205
One little up and your
ass is on the chopping block.

37:17.239 --> 37:19.540
<i>Yeah.
Unfortunately.</i>

37:19.575 --> 37:21.609
That's how this is
gonna get played from now on.

37:21.644 --> 37:24.412
I'm not voting
for my self.

37:24.446 --> 37:25.980
Please. I'm from Philly.

37:26.015 --> 37:27.649
Throwing the towel in
is not an option.

37:27.683 --> 37:29.884
<i>All right, so who are the two?</i>

37:31.987 --> 37:34.255
The biggest issue tonight
was the whole tuna debacle.

37:34.289 --> 37:37.525
<i>We have to nominate Amanda.</i>

37:37.559 --> 37:40.328
Every single tuna came back,
one right after the other,

37:40.362 --> 37:43.064
right after the other,
right after the other.

37:43.098 --> 37:45.133
I would just...
I'd have to say you, Amanda,

37:45.167 --> 37:47.368
<i>because of the tuna.</i>

37:47.403 --> 37:50.271
And I would say Cyndi,
just 'cause of your steak.

37:50.305 --> 37:52.573
I should not
be going up tonight.

37:52.608 --> 37:55.176
I've been a leader since
I walked into Hell's Kitchen.

37:55.210 --> 37:57.645
It's time to cut the dead
weight, and I'm not it.

37:57.680 --> 37:59.547
Y'all want to put me up,
put me up.

37:59.581 --> 38:00.882
<i>I'm gonna fight, though.</i>

38:00.916 --> 38:04.819
I don't agree with sending
Cyndi up there at all.

38:04.853 --> 38:09.457
The only other person
that up is Nedra.

38:09.491 --> 38:11.225
I had a skinny chicken
and a thick chicken.

38:11.260 --> 38:13.227
<i>They went in the pan
at the same time,</i>

38:13.262 --> 38:16.264
and,,
I- I sent one up.

38:16.298 --> 38:21.269
Nedra never lives up
to anything that she ever does.

38:21.303 --> 38:23.337
I hope to God
that she's the next to go.

38:23.372 --> 38:25.640
So what's our team decide?

38:31.046 --> 38:32.646
*

38:40.022 --> 38:42.090
I am not happy.

38:42.124 --> 38:44.692
One amazing Quinceanera,

38:44.727 --> 38:47.228
and you completely
it up.

38:48.931 --> 38:50.031
Blue team, have you
made a decision?

38:50.065 --> 38:51.265
Yes, chef.
Yes, chef.

38:51.300 --> 38:53.968
<i>Ray, first nominee and why.</i>

38:54.002 --> 38:55.336
Chef, our first nominee
was Barrett,

38:55.370 --> 38:59.974
uh, based on the, uh,
performance with the pasta.

39:00.008 --> 39:01.709
Second nominee and why?

39:01.744 --> 39:03.978
Chef, our second nominee
was Zach.

39:04.012 --> 39:06.547
He didn't fire the potatoes,
and that kinda

39:06.582 --> 39:08.983
held up some of the entrees.

39:09.017 --> 39:10.318
Red team, have you
reached a decision?

39:10.352 --> 39:11.319
Yes, chef.

39:11.353 --> 39:13.087
<i>Good. Ja'nel.</i>

39:13.122 --> 39:15.957
Chef, tonight,
our first nominee is Amanda

39:15.991 --> 39:20.261
because of her performance
on the appetizers.

39:20.295 --> 39:22.230
She just couldn't get it right.

39:22.264 --> 39:26.067
Our second nominee was a little
more difficult to determine.

39:34.745 --> 39:39.249
The blue team has nominated
Barrett and Zach for elimination.

39:39.283 --> 39:42.819
As for the red team, the women
have nominated Amanda,

39:42.853 --> 39:45.822
and now they must give chef
Ramsay their second selection.

39:45.856 --> 39:47.690
Chef, our second nominee

39:47.725 --> 39:51.327
was a little more
difficult to determine.

39:51.362 --> 39:53.263
We came up with Cyndi

39:53.297 --> 39:55.965
because of the rib eyes
that came back raw.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.901
I agree with that.

39:57.935 --> 40:01.504
<i>Barrett, Zach, Amanda, Cyndi,
step forward, please.</i>

40:06.811 --> 40:08.778
<i>Cyndi.
Yes, chef?</i>

40:08.813 --> 40:10.413
Why do you think you should
stay in Hell's Kitchen?

40:10.448 --> 40:11.815
I think I should stay
in Hell's Kitchen, chef,

40:11.849 --> 40:13.850
because tonight
is my worst performance,

40:13.884 --> 40:15.085
and it's never gonna
happen again.

40:15.119 --> 40:17.754
Do you give a?
I give a huge, chef.

40:19.957 --> 40:22.125
Amanda.
Yes, chef?

40:22.159 --> 40:23.626
Tell me why you think you should
stay in Hell's Kitchen.

40:23.661 --> 40:26.729
Chef, from day one,
I've never given up.

40:26.764 --> 40:28.364
<i>I know I disappointed you</i>

40:28.399 --> 40:31.568
and that young lady today
with that tuna.

40:31.602 --> 40:32.836
When you're in the weeds
like that,

40:32.870 --> 40:35.338
<i>what's the one thing
you should do?</i>

40:35.372 --> 40:37.073
Take control of my station.

40:37.108 --> 40:39.576
Which you didn't do.

40:39.610 --> 40:42.145
Zach.
Yes, chef?

40:42.179 --> 40:44.414
Why do you think you should
stay in this competition?

40:44.448 --> 40:46.616
Because I'm passionate
about what I do.

40:46.650 --> 40:48.218
<i>I believe in what I do,</i>

40:48.252 --> 40:50.587
and at the end of the day,
I enjoy what I do.

40:50.621 --> 40:52.755
You're not cut out
for this level, are you?

40:52.790 --> 40:55.158
Yes, I am, chef.

40:55.192 --> 40:57.427
Barrett.
Yes, chef?

40:57.461 --> 41:00.230
Why do you think you should
stay in Hell's Kitchen?

41:00.264 --> 41:01.865
Because this is what I do.
I have such passion for it.

41:01.899 --> 41:03.233
You could knock me down,
like I said, 100 times.

41:03.267 --> 41:05.435
<i>I'd get back 101.</i>

41:05.469 --> 41:06.703
So for me to go home
right now in this competition,

41:06.737 --> 41:09.272
it's... it's not even
an option for me.

41:09.306 --> 41:12.375
Okay. Yeah, I'm not happy.

41:12.409 --> 41:16.312
I mean, honestly, one, two,
three, four of you,

41:16.347 --> 41:19.082
<i>I want to send all of you home.</i>

41:19.116 --> 41:20.783
My decision is...

41:23.821 --> 41:25.121
*

41:25.156 --> 41:27.824
Amanda...
Give me your jacket.

41:27.858 --> 41:30.426
<i>Your time is done
in Hell's Kitchen.</i>

41:30.461 --> 41:32.795
Thank you.

41:37.301 --> 41:41.204
I didn't expect to be
leaving Hell's Kitchen so soon.

41:41.238 --> 41:44.908
This is something I've been
doing for 13 years.

41:44.942 --> 41:47.744
I thought it was easy,
and it's not.

41:47.778 --> 41:50.813
It's not easy,
I'll tell you that.

41:50.848 --> 41:53.383
It's not easy.

41:53.417 --> 41:55.618
<i>Tonight was a disaster.</i>

41:57.755 --> 42:00.323
An embarrassment.

42:00.357 --> 42:02.525
And that is why I am not done.

42:05.563 --> 42:08.565
*

42:09.967 --> 42:12.268
<i>
Next time, on Hell's Kitchen...</i>

42:12.303 --> 42:13.736
Hello? Who's that?

42:13.771 --> 42:16.272
An urgent phone
call changes everything.

42:16.307 --> 42:20.076
Tonight, our guests are very
important to the entire country.

42:20.110 --> 42:22.712
They're cooking
for top secret VIPs.

42:22.746 --> 42:24.914
If ever I wanted
a perfect evening,

42:24.949 --> 42:26.382
<i>tonight is the night.</i>

42:26.417 --> 42:28.685
And the stakes
are higher than ever...

42:28.719 --> 42:30.620
Look at me. You're not even
directing anything.

42:30.654 --> 42:31.621
I'm a little frazzled.

42:31.655 --> 42:33.223
When are you two gonna wake up?

42:33.257 --> 42:34.991
And one chef sabotaged...

42:35.025 --> 42:37.093
I don't care who
I have to take down.

42:37.127 --> 42:38.795
You're a disgrace.
Don't lie!

42:38.829 --> 42:41.598
Forces chef
Ramsay onto the line.

42:41.632 --> 42:43.132
I can't around tonight.

42:43.167 --> 42:44.634
But will a disastrous mistake...

42:44.668 --> 42:47.370
! You'll
kill someone with that!

42:47.404 --> 42:48.838
Get the out of here!

42:48.872 --> 42:50.473
Threaten national security?

42:50.507 --> 42:52.675
<i>What the is that?
Oh, my God!</i>

42:52.710 --> 42:54.244
<i>Are you kidding me?
I'm done!</i>

42:54.278 --> 42:56.679
It's over.
