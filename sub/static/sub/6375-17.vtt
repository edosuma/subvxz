WEBVTT

00:01.652 --> 00:05.850
Okay, I need to say something,
and this is really hard.

00:06.457 --> 00:08.891
You know,
in situations like these, it's...

00:09.259 --> 00:13.127
It's best to just take a deep breath
and say it.

00:14.164 --> 00:17.656
Grimaldi's pizza is slightly superior
to Lombardi's. You win.

00:17.768 --> 00:21.033
Never challenge me when it comes
to pizza because you will always lose.

00:21.271 --> 00:22.829
My dollar, please.

00:27.010 --> 00:29.307
- What's this?
- Open it and see.

00:32.982 --> 00:34.176
It's a hair clip.

00:34.817 --> 00:36.785
- Matt...
- I saw it and thought of you.

00:37.120 --> 00:40.283
"B" for Betty.
The stones aren't real or anything.

00:40.323 --> 00:42.223
I mean, no, they're real,
they're just not, you know...

00:42.258 --> 00:44.283
It's beautiful. I love it.

00:45.128 --> 00:47.528
I wanted to get you something
in honor of our monthiversary.

00:47.563 --> 00:49.929
Has it been a month already?

00:50.433 --> 00:52.833
You know, you don't always
have to bring me back to Queens.

00:52.935 --> 00:54.425
Well, that's where my queen lives.

00:56.305 --> 00:57.431
Dad!

01:00.643 --> 01:05.046
I'm so sorry.
I didn't realize you two were out here.

01:05.815 --> 01:07.407
- Hi, Matt.
- Hello, Mr. Suarez.

01:07.483 --> 01:09.246
Yeah, I was on my way
to the Pannebiancos

01:09.318 --> 01:11.684
to see if I could borrow their cooler
to go on this trip.

01:11.721 --> 01:14.019
- I made them sugar cookies.
- What trip?

01:14.056 --> 01:17.787
My dad is taking Justin to a cabin in the
Poconos with Elena and her nephews.

01:17.827 --> 01:20.192
- Well, that should be cool.
- Yeah, cool.

01:22.831 --> 01:26.232
Okay. I'll see you kids later.

01:29.704 --> 01:31.399
- Sorry.
- No, it's okay.

01:33.141 --> 01:34.802
You don't have to walk me
all the way in.

01:34.843 --> 01:37.744
Well, what can I say? I'm a nice guy.

01:38.680 --> 01:41.148
- Hey, I had fun tonight.
- Oh. Me, too.

01:44.553 --> 01:46.316
Okay...

01:46.354 --> 01:48.083
Thank you, thanks for dinner.

01:48.123 --> 01:49.750
- It was delicious.
- You're welcome.

01:49.791 --> 01:51.918
Okay. Yeah. Okay.

01:52.928 --> 01:54.054
<i>Papi!</i>

01:54.095 --> 01:56.928
Oh, no! I'm so sorry!

01:57.599 --> 01:59.726
It's okay. I have a hard head.
How you doing, Mr. Suarez?

01:59.768 --> 02:02.396
Good, good!
How are you, Councilman?

02:02.437 --> 02:05.235
- I'm good.
- Good! Good!

02:06.107 --> 02:08.735
Well, I guess I should be getting home.
I'll see you tomorrow, Hilda.

02:08.776 --> 02:10.038
Okay. Okay.

02:10.077 --> 02:11.772
- Good night.
- All right.

02:11.979 --> 02:13.344
Bye for now!

02:15.616 --> 02:18.244
So, another date, huh?

02:18.319 --> 02:20.378
Things are going good
between you guys.

02:20.454 --> 02:21.478
I guess.

02:21.555 --> 02:23.819
Hilda, how was your date?

02:23.857 --> 02:26.485
You guess?
Why aren't you more enthusiastic?

02:26.660 --> 02:28.150
Archie is a great guy.

02:28.195 --> 02:31.631
<i>I know, papi, okay? I like him.</i>

02:31.665 --> 02:35.192
I'm just not sure if I like him yet.

02:35.236 --> 02:39.366
Hilda, that's like saying you're not sure
you like sirloin steak! It's crazy!

02:40.207 --> 02:41.538
Mom?

02:41.575 --> 02:43.805
Do I really have to go camping
with Grandpa and Elena?

02:43.944 --> 02:46.572
Yes. Elena's nephews
are dying to meet you.

02:46.647 --> 02:48.376
And they planned the whole thing
with you in mind.

02:48.449 --> 02:49.677
If they'd planned it with me in mind,

02:49.750 --> 02:53.686
it would be at a spa with mud baths
and ginger facials.

02:53.754 --> 02:57.019
You're going.
There will be plenty of mud.

03:00.294 --> 03:02.818
<i>Mostly sunny,
highs in the lower 40s...</i>

03:02.996 --> 03:07.023
<i>You are my sunshine</i>

03:07.567 --> 03:11.594
<i>My only sunshine</i>

03:12.105 --> 03:16.098
<i>You make me happy</i>

03:16.609 --> 03:20.136
<i>When skies are gray</i>

03:20.947 --> 03:24.883
<i>You'll never know, dear</i>

03:25.551 --> 03:26.677
Connor?

03:26.753 --> 03:28.584
<i>How much I love you</i>

03:29.022 --> 03:33.550
<i>Please don't take my sunshine away</i>

03:33.593 --> 03:34.685
Connor?

03:36.000 --> 03:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:52.278 --> 03:56.475
<i>Okay, guys, with Mode's first ever sex
issue on the stand in just three days,</i>

03:56.548 --> 03:58.982
it may seem like the hard work is over.
But it's not.

03:59.551 --> 04:02.418
In order to get new advertisers
and keep the old ones,

04:02.454 --> 04:04.854
we have to make sure
our overnight numbers kill.

04:04.890 --> 04:08.553
That means using every resource
we can to get people talking.

04:08.593 --> 04:09.617
You know, fire them up!

04:09.661 --> 04:12.391
Oh. Daniel, we could do a tie-in
with modeny. com.

04:12.431 --> 04:13.523
- Bring it.
- Great!

04:13.565 --> 04:15.089
See, that's an awesome idea.

04:15.133 --> 04:17.567
I think you people know
how important this issue is.

04:25.610 --> 04:29.706
Pardon me. I had a late night.

04:29.781 --> 04:31.112
Here's a little more coffee
for you, Willie.

04:31.149 --> 04:33.743
All right. You all know what to do.
Let's get to it.

04:38.924 --> 04:41.722
Okay, you are going to laugh.

04:41.760 --> 04:44.387
I just got off the phone
with the Olsen twins.

04:44.428 --> 04:48.762
Apparently, they feel just awful
that they didn't include you

04:48.799 --> 04:51.962
<i>in their big Influence coffee table book.</i>

04:52.136 --> 04:54.798
So, they would love it
if you would be a part

04:54.839 --> 04:57.330
<i>of their next book, More Influence.</i>

04:58.843 --> 04:59.867
Willie?

05:04.949 --> 05:06.246
Willie?

05:09.987 --> 05:14.686
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! She's dead!

05:14.959 --> 05:16.221
She's dead!

05:16.394 --> 05:20.091
Stop your shrieking, Marc!
I was just taking a nap.

05:22.032 --> 05:23.727
But your eyes were...

05:23.768 --> 05:25.429
I haven't slept in weeks.

05:25.803 --> 05:31.708
I just lie awake all night,
feeling so tense.

05:31.742 --> 05:35.837
Well, naturally, look at your desk.
It's a mess!

05:40.683 --> 05:43.379
Maybe something else is on your mind?

05:43.420 --> 05:45.911
Yes. Getting a good night's sleep
is on my mind.

05:46.389 --> 05:49.654
I can't even take a sleeping pill
because of that damn baby.

05:50.927 --> 05:53.896
Marc, I need help.

05:53.930 --> 05:55.056
Of course you do.

05:56.800 --> 05:59.166
And I am here for you.

06:00.203 --> 06:02.262
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

06:02.572 --> 06:04.767
I meant I need you
to hire a night nanny!

06:04.808 --> 06:05.832
Oh.

06:06.409 --> 06:08.639
Okay, well, I'll get right on it.

06:09.579 --> 06:15.779
But, Willie, are there maybe
some other night needs

06:16.519 --> 06:17.747
that aren't being met?

06:20.056 --> 06:22.115
Willie. Willie?

06:23.626 --> 06:25.150
Oh, that's so weird!

06:27.596 --> 06:29.826
Hey, Betty! About our web thing,

06:29.865 --> 06:33.631
what do you think about "Fun Sex
Versus Boring Relationship Sex"?

06:33.669 --> 06:36.502
You can write about all the boring
things you do with what's-his-name.

06:36.538 --> 06:37.732
- Matt.
- Whatever.

06:37.773 --> 06:39.707
And I can write about all the fun things

06:39.741 --> 06:41.709
I'm going to do with whatever guy
I meet tonight!

06:41.743 --> 06:45.179
How about the
"Modern Day Mating Rituals"?

06:45.247 --> 06:47.215
You know,
something a little less personal.

06:47.282 --> 06:49.409
You slut! Why? What are you hiding?

06:49.451 --> 06:50.679
Matt's into kink, isn't he?

06:50.719 --> 06:52.710
Is he a leather pig?
Does he like ice cubing?

06:52.754 --> 06:53.914
- Ice what?
- Cubing.

06:53.956 --> 06:57.826
No! Matt is into normal things, I think.

06:57.826 --> 06:59.555
Oh, my God!

06:59.828 --> 07:02.763
Are you actually saying
that you haven't tapped that yet?

07:03.499 --> 07:06.627
No. But we're definitely headed
in that direction.

07:06.668 --> 07:09.068
We just haven't gotten there yet.
This is none of your business!

07:09.104 --> 07:11.334
But, Betty, you have been dating
for, like, a year!

07:11.373 --> 07:12.601
- A month.
- Exactly.

07:12.641 --> 07:16.600
And he's a billionaire! And for
some reason, he seems to be into you.

07:16.845 --> 07:19.312
What the hell are you waiting for?

07:29.924 --> 07:32.222
- Betty, are you wearing lip gloss?
- Maybe.

07:32.260 --> 07:34.694
Ooh! What's the special occasion?

07:34.729 --> 07:39.223
Matt and I have a date, and I was kind
of hoping tonight would be the night.

07:39.534 --> 07:42.230
Hoping? If you're ready, just tell him.

07:42.436 --> 07:45.371
Well, it's not that easy.
I mean, I've never had to do that before.

07:45.406 --> 07:47.340
With Henry and Walter,
it just kind of happened.

07:47.408 --> 07:52.971
Yeah, well, some guys need more
of a push. Let me see your bra.

07:53.047 --> 07:54.412
- Stop!
- What?

07:55.683 --> 07:57.378
<i>Papi, jeez!</i>

07:57.418 --> 08:00.649
You're going camping
for two days, not two weeks.

08:00.688 --> 08:03.316
I know! He can bring
six cans of bug spray,

08:03.357 --> 08:04.790
but I can't bring a blow-dryer?

08:04.825 --> 08:07.658
- There's no electricity.
- Oh. Dear God.

08:08.462 --> 08:11.692
Hey, we hit the road at 5:00 a. m.
You girls up for an early breakfast?

08:11.798 --> 08:13.322
Well, I know I'll be there.

08:13.366 --> 08:15.561
I have a date with Archie,
so I should be in bed by 9:00.

08:15.602 --> 08:17.263
Good. How about you, Betty?

08:17.304 --> 08:19.772
Actually, I...

08:21.241 --> 08:22.868
Matt and I are gonna have a late dinner.

08:23.310 --> 08:24.334
That's all right.

08:24.411 --> 08:26.845
I'll just come in and give you
a little kiss before we leave.

08:26.880 --> 08:27.869
Aw.

08:27.981 --> 08:31.075
<i>Papi, I think I'm gonna stay
in the city tonight,</i>

08:31.117 --> 08:33.551
you know, get some work
on my web article done.

08:33.587 --> 08:37.457
How can you stay in the city?
You don't have a place there anymore.

08:37.457 --> 08:40.051
<i>Jeez, papi! She's spending
the night with her boyfriend.</i>

08:40.226 --> 08:42.091
Even I knew that.
She's wearing lip gloss.

08:46.633 --> 08:50.228
Okay, I'll just see you when I see you.

08:52.939 --> 08:54.964
- Shut up!
- Have fun!

08:55.041 --> 08:57.305
Mmm. Bye!

09:02.181 --> 09:04.012
Hey, Daniel,
can I ask you something?

09:05.351 --> 09:08.047
What do you think of me
doing a poetry slam?

09:11.657 --> 09:12.817
Oh, you're serious?

09:13.092 --> 09:14.855
Yeah. I've been
writing poetry for years,

09:14.893 --> 09:16.758
and I never had the nerve
to perform any of it.

09:16.795 --> 09:18.456
It's something
I've kind of always wanted to do.

09:18.931 --> 09:20.899
Then, uh, you should definitely do that.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.594
- You don't think it sounds crazy?
- I didn't say that.

09:23.736 --> 09:25.101
Hey!

09:25.804 --> 09:28.068
No, seriously. I think...
I think that's brave.

09:28.207 --> 09:30.698
You couldn't pay me enough to get up
in front of people and perform.

09:30.776 --> 09:31.765
Why?

09:31.844 --> 09:35.245
Just a horrible, scarring
high school rock band experience.

09:35.280 --> 09:37.874
Oh, my God! You were in a band?
What did you play?

09:38.183 --> 09:39.445
- Guitar.
- Mmm.

09:39.485 --> 09:43.478
Sort of. I thought I was really good.
I was really bad.

09:43.756 --> 09:44.780
What happened?

09:45.491 --> 09:48.927
I had to write
this incredibly cheesy song.

09:48.961 --> 09:52.589
<i>Crash and Burn, it was called,
for the Battle of the Bands at school.</i>

09:52.630 --> 09:54.257
I was laughed off the stage.

09:54.599 --> 09:56.533
- Oh.
- You would've laughed too, though.

09:56.567 --> 09:57.898
Especially if you'd seen my hair.

09:59.604 --> 10:02.038
- I want to see a picture.
- No, no, no. Forget it.

10:02.507 --> 10:04.566
I wouldn't want to ruin
your perfect image of me.

10:04.642 --> 10:05.631
Too late.

10:10.148 --> 10:14.812
Okay, Mr. Prodigy Piano Guy...
How's this one?

10:15.586 --> 10:16.814
<i>La!</i>

10:16.854 --> 10:19.049
That was it, that was it!
That was a perfect A flat.

10:19.490 --> 10:20.650
Shut up, you're a bad liar.

10:20.692 --> 10:23.661
No, I'm not lying. I'm still deaf in this
ear from when you did your C sharp.

10:23.695 --> 10:24.923
Hey!

10:39.577 --> 10:41.738
I guess I should get you a cab.

10:41.779 --> 10:46.613
Or I could come upstairs
and take a peek at your new wall color.

10:48.018 --> 10:51.249
That's funny! Wait, here comes one.
Hey, hey, taxi!

10:51.288 --> 10:53.518
No, Matt. I'm not expected home...

10:53.557 --> 10:54.615
No, come on. Don't be silly.

10:54.658 --> 10:56.285
I don't want you to be cold,
all right, let's get you in.

10:56.326 --> 10:58.191
- I'm not cold!
- There you go, all right.

10:58.295 --> 10:59.922
All right. I'll call you later, bye!

11:05.202 --> 11:27.858
That guy couldn't
get rid of you fast enough!

11:27.858 --> 11:32.591
Thanks, Archie. That's sweet.
Okay. Talk to you later!

11:33.163 --> 11:36.495
What kind of a guy
calls an hour after a date

11:36.532 --> 11:38.056
to say he had a good time?

11:38.100 --> 11:39.727
I think he's a little too into me.

11:39.769 --> 11:42.897
He spent all night touching my arm
and trying to hold my hand.

11:43.439 --> 11:44.838
Aw. Poor Hilda.

11:45.074 --> 11:47.565
A nice guy can't keep his hands off
of you. How awful.

11:47.877 --> 11:50.437
Excuse me? What is your problem?

11:50.679 --> 11:53.079
My problem is that
you've been complaining about Archie

11:53.115 --> 11:54.912
since the two of you
started seeing each other.

11:55.050 --> 11:58.986
"He's so into me. "
"He calls just to say nice things. "

11:59.021 --> 12:01.922
If it bothers you that much, then
why don't you just break up with him?

12:02.191 --> 12:05.683
Maybe you're right. I tried to do
the nice guy thing. What can I say?

12:05.728 --> 12:06.956
He's just not my type.

12:07.596 --> 12:09.223
Hey, what are you
doing home, anyway?

12:09.265 --> 12:11.927
I thought tonight was supposed
to be, like, the night.

12:12.234 --> 12:14.225
Well, apparently, it wasn't.

12:15.070 --> 12:18.403
- What happened?
- Nothing. Nothing happened.

12:18.908 --> 12:21.843
I tried to make it very clear
that I wanted to stay over,

12:22.144 --> 12:24.772
and he just laughed
and put me in a cab.

12:25.613 --> 12:27.308
Well, maybe he misunderstood
your signals.

12:27.415 --> 12:29.406
You're very subtle. That's your style.

12:29.884 --> 12:32.318
Rule number one, never be subtle.

12:33.454 --> 12:36.855
I don't know. I mean,
I think subtlety works sometimes.

12:36.891 --> 12:39.826
Yeah, maybe 100 years ago
in, like, the 1950s.

12:39.861 --> 12:42.352
But trust me.
These days, bolder is better.

12:42.797 --> 12:47.666
So, what, a girl's just supposed
to come out and say it?

12:48.102 --> 12:51.765
You know, like I want to...

12:53.808 --> 12:55.537
You know.
I mean, not everybody can do that.

12:55.577 --> 12:59.308
Oh, my God!
Still dry in Betty County?

12:59.347 --> 13:01.747
Still none of your business, Amanda.

13:01.783 --> 13:02.875
Exactly!

13:02.917 --> 13:05.078
Betty, in honor of us
once being roommates,

13:05.119 --> 13:08.350
I'm going to personally teach you
how to be sexy.

13:08.957 --> 13:11.425
Or, you know, as sexy as this can be.

13:11.626 --> 13:14.094
I will show you
some of my no-fail moves.

13:14.128 --> 13:16.789
Admit it, Betty. You need
a little help in this department.

13:17.064 --> 13:19.055
It'll be great for our article.

13:22.402 --> 13:23.391
Well...

13:23.470 --> 13:27.167
Get ready, Betty!
Because the sex train is coming!

13:30.577 --> 13:32.602
How lame.

13:32.913 --> 13:36.349
- How cool! A poetry slam?
- Yep. Molly's super excited,

13:36.383 --> 13:39.250
and I've been so busy trying
to keep this company together,

13:39.386 --> 13:41.286
I just really want it
to be a big night for her.

13:41.321 --> 13:43.312
Well, I'll definitely be there.
I love poetry.

13:43.357 --> 13:45.257
It was one of my favorite classes
in college.

13:45.292 --> 13:46.418
- Really?
- Yeah!

13:46.627 --> 13:49.460
Well, maybe you should read this.
I think it's pretty good.

13:49.496 --> 13:51.555
Although I'm not much
of a poetry person.

13:51.598 --> 13:54.226
"Softly Caressing Waves. " Good title.

13:56.403 --> 13:57.768
Oh.

13:59.006 --> 14:01.804
Wow. Wow.

14:01.842 --> 14:03.901
Wow what?
Wow "good" or wow "bad"?

14:04.044 --> 14:05.443
Just wow.

14:05.812 --> 14:11.306
I'm impressed that Molly's reading this.
It's very personal and intimate.

14:11.484 --> 14:13.384
It is? I thought it was about the ocean.

14:13.419 --> 14:19.153
Daniel, the ocean
is a metaphor for you and her,

14:19.325 --> 14:23.762
and the two of you "softly caressing. "

14:25.031 --> 14:28.159
Wow. I mean, I totally missed that.
Are you sure?

14:28.534 --> 14:29.592
Pretty sure.

14:29.669 --> 14:34.163
"I lay my head on the soft, pale sand,
breathing in his salty scent"

14:34.540 --> 14:36.371
- Is that supposed to be my chest?
- Mmm-hmm.

14:36.409 --> 14:39.708
And I'm pretty sure
that the rock is your head.

14:39.745 --> 14:43.340
- How do you know it's my head?
- Because it's crying.

14:43.549 --> 14:45.449
Wait, what? Rocks don't cry!

14:53.826 --> 14:57.159
Wow, it's so weird to be back here.

14:57.563 --> 15:01.965
I know, right?
I miss the me I was with us.

15:02.634 --> 15:06.866
Okay! We're ready for
Operation Betty Sexification!

15:06.905 --> 15:09.135
Amanda, I thought
it was just going to be us girls.

15:09.174 --> 15:10.163
It is.

15:10.241 --> 15:12.334
You can thank us later
by taking us to lunch.

15:12.610 --> 15:14.703
This is
an impossible deadline.

15:14.746 --> 15:17.180
Matt's going to be here in two hours.

15:17.515 --> 15:19.745
God, where do we even begin?
Look at her!

15:19.784 --> 15:22.651
Hmm. Yeah, this is a toughie.

15:22.687 --> 15:24.279
- We have to stay calm.
- Mmm-hmm.

15:24.322 --> 15:27.348
The key is to
come at your target using all six senses,

15:27.392 --> 15:31.260
sound, smell, taste,
touch, sight and style.

15:31.296 --> 15:33.230
- Well, technically, style is...
Shh!

15:33.298 --> 15:36.028
We have to work fast and furious
if we're gonna make it in time.

15:36.101 --> 15:37.500
Now, pay attention.

15:37.669 --> 15:39.796
First sense, sound!

15:42.807 --> 15:46.004
Next sense, smell.

15:50.848 --> 15:52.577
Taste.

15:53.717 --> 15:57.414
<i>Show him your lips
are available and open for business.</i>

16:01.125 --> 16:03.593
<i>Eat slowly and seductively.</i>

16:05.863 --> 16:07.387
Touch.

16:07.531 --> 16:09.499
<i>Ignite his pleasure center</i>

16:09.566 --> 16:11.534
<i>with a soft graze.</i>

16:15.339 --> 16:18.934
<i>Sight and style!</i>

16:18.976 --> 16:21.774
Now the art
of the seductive hair flick!

16:27.284 --> 16:31.812
Flick, flick, flick.

16:33.357 --> 16:35.951
Okay, put this on.
Now, what about those braces?

16:35.993 --> 16:37.426
- Can those come off?
- No.

16:37.461 --> 16:39.224
Can we at least
lose the glasses?

16:39.263 --> 16:42.754
- I kind of need them to see.
- My concern is what he's going to see.

16:42.832 --> 16:44.925
Oh, and don't forget
about this.

16:45.368 --> 16:48.860
- A ladle? What's this for?
- You'll know when the time comes.

16:49.372 --> 16:50.999
I can't believe I'm saying this,

16:51.040 --> 16:55.238
but Betty Suarez is getting
some strange tonight.

16:56.012 --> 16:57.775
Hey, thanks, guys.

16:57.814 --> 16:59.042
Go get him, tiger!

17:24.272 --> 17:28.368
Where did it go?
Where are you?

17:29.512 --> 17:31.275
Who the hell are you?

17:36.084 --> 17:38.075
I'm your new night nanny.

17:38.120 --> 17:41.146
The new night nanny?
What was that growling?

17:42.190 --> 17:43.384
Oh, oh.

17:43.425 --> 17:46.292
<i>I was reading William
Goldilocks and the Three Bears.</i>

17:46.328 --> 17:49.525
I guess I got a little carried away.

17:50.699 --> 17:54.601
I'm sorry if I woke you up.
I'm James, by the way.

17:57.939 --> 17:59.497
Well, carry on, James.

18:18.627 --> 18:20.959
This place is even better
than last night.

18:21.363 --> 18:22.830
We'll have two orders of that, please.

18:24.065 --> 18:27.864
- You have got to try this dish. It's killer.
- Okay.

18:29.470 --> 18:33.873
Don't move!
You just look really pretty in that light.

18:34.141 --> 18:35.608
Oh. Thank you.

18:35.643 --> 18:37.372
And now you moved, and it's gone.

18:38.612 --> 18:40.637
Kidding. It's still all good.

18:43.150 --> 18:45.482
Listen, Archie.

18:46.554 --> 18:49.148
- I think maybe...
Archie?

18:49.523 --> 18:51.855
Archie, I thought that was you!
How are you?

18:51.892 --> 18:54.417
I'm good. Real good.

18:54.695 --> 18:57.765
Hilda, this is Felissa.
She and I used to be neighbors.

18:57.765 --> 19:00.199
Well, we used to be more than that.

19:00.267 --> 19:04.226
Biggest mistake I ever made was letting
this one slip through my fingers.

19:09.810 --> 19:12.506
I thought I'd take a break from
making flashcards and seduce you.

19:14.315 --> 19:17.875
Oh, God, I love your chest.
It's so warm and cozy...

19:18.351 --> 19:21.912
So, I finally had a chance
to read your poem.

19:22.722 --> 19:24.087
- You did?
- Yeah.

19:24.557 --> 19:26.718
- What did you think?
- Yeah, it's great.

19:27.594 --> 19:32.725
I had some thoughts, you know, from
an editorial perspective, if you want.

19:32.799 --> 19:35.734
That would be great!
I would love your professional opinion.

19:35.935 --> 19:38.631
- I'll go grab it.
- I've got it right here!

19:39.706 --> 19:42.004
Wow. You made a lot of notes.

19:42.041 --> 19:44.134
No, no. I just kind of
jotted down some ideas.

19:44.177 --> 19:47.112
Like instead of "softly caressing,"

19:47.146 --> 19:49.876
maybe the waves should
be "hard" and "crashing. "

19:50.250 --> 19:53.981
And should this rock
really "sprout tears"?

19:54.220 --> 19:55.687
It seems exaggerated.

19:55.989 --> 20:00.551
I mean, I would buy it if the rock
maybe shed a single tear once.

20:00.827 --> 20:02.761
Or you could just lose the image
altogether.

20:02.795 --> 20:06.458
Okay. You wanna tell me
what this is really about?

20:07.633 --> 20:13.230
I know this poem is about us,
you know, having sex.

20:13.272 --> 20:16.241
Yeah, so?

20:16.275 --> 20:18.800
So,
you're gonna read this in public,

20:18.844 --> 20:21.278
right in front of people I work with.

20:21.680 --> 20:22.942
It's embarrassing.

20:23.915 --> 20:25.177
I see.

20:27.452 --> 20:29.716
Well, the last thing I wanted to do
was embarrass you.

20:29.755 --> 20:31.222
- Molly, come on...
- No. It's fine.

20:31.256 --> 20:34.692
I'll just read something else.
I should get back to work.

20:40.999 --> 20:43.092
You always did know
how to make me laugh.

20:43.702 --> 20:45.636
I swear,
the biggest mistake I ever made

20:45.671 --> 20:48.037
was letting this guy slip through
my fingers.

20:49.041 --> 20:51.100
Yeah. You mentioned that.

20:51.143 --> 20:55.011
Felissa? Maybe we should get started
on our food before it gets cold.

20:55.047 --> 20:57.777
Oh, my God! I didn't even notice.
What a jerk.

20:58.183 --> 21:00.810
- It was so nice meeting you.
- Yeah, you, too.

21:00.851 --> 21:02.113
Call me, sugar.

21:04.989 --> 21:07.423
I'm sorry. Felissa's a bit of a talker.

21:07.925 --> 21:12.123
I know. I was like,
"Hello! We're on a date here!"

21:19.036 --> 21:20.526
Come in!

21:24.008 --> 21:25.066
Hello?

21:25.109 --> 21:26.770
Oh! Hey, Matt. I'll be right out.

21:26.811 --> 21:28.438
I'm just changing
out of my work clothes.

21:28.479 --> 21:30.140
Okay!

21:30.181 --> 21:32.115
Wow! This place is cool.

21:32.149 --> 21:33.548
Now I can see
why you were so bummed out

21:33.584 --> 21:34.812
when you had to give it up.

21:35.486 --> 21:38.284
You know, we should probably get
going if we're gonna make that movie.

21:43.227 --> 21:44.956
What's your hurry, soldier?

21:53.036 --> 21:57.097
Wow, you look great,
but the movie starts in like 20 minutes.

21:57.140 --> 21:58.198
You should probably get dressed.

21:58.308 --> 22:01.175
Actually, I was thinking

22:01.511 --> 22:07.040
maybe we could just stay in tonight
and relax.

22:08.184 --> 22:09.947
Oh! I made mojitos.

22:11.554 --> 22:12.646
Want one?

22:13.223 --> 22:18.559
I'm not really
a mojito kind of guy.

22:19.763 --> 22:24.496
Oh, okay. Well, then we could
just get comfortable.

22:28.104 --> 22:31.505
And sit. We could sit.

22:34.377 --> 22:35.401
Ooh!

22:36.212 --> 22:37.577
Look what you found.

22:41.116 --> 22:42.515
Sorry. Here.

22:43.886 --> 22:46.013
We should probably
just go to that movie.

22:47.055 --> 22:53.756
Or we could stay here
and, you know, be together.

23:01.937 --> 23:04.497
Betty, I can't do this. I...

23:05.774 --> 23:07.241
Matt, where are you going?

23:08.076 --> 23:11.534
Betty, I'm sorry. It's not you, it's me.

23:28.764 --> 23:32.631
- Wow. That was... Wow.
- I know.

23:32.667 --> 23:36.728
- I did not expect that to happen.
- Me, neither. I...

23:37.705 --> 23:40.572
To be honest, I actually thought
you were going to break up with me.

23:43.444 --> 23:45.378
I totally was!

23:46.481 --> 23:48.210
- You were?
- Yeah.

23:48.850 --> 23:51.717
If Felissa hadn't stopped by
and interrupted me,

23:51.752 --> 23:55.586
this evening would have gone
a hell of a lot differently.

23:56.290 --> 23:58.224
So, what made you change your mind?

23:58.659 --> 23:59.648
Huh?

24:01.062 --> 24:02.529
Oh, I don't know.

24:02.830 --> 24:04.058
You weren't even going
to give me a chance

24:04.098 --> 24:05.793
till you saw another woman
was into me.

24:05.833 --> 24:10.031
What? That is not true!

24:12.373 --> 24:14.432
Okay, all right,
well, maybe it is a little bit true.

24:14.475 --> 24:16.966
But usually I go
for a different kind of guy, you know?

24:17.011 --> 24:20.242
Right. So do I need Felissa to interrupt
every date to get you in the mood?

24:20.281 --> 24:23.148
Because that would be,
you know, pretty complicated foreplay.

24:23.384 --> 24:24.645
No!

24:26.286 --> 24:29.346
But a little tattoo on your butt
wouldn't hurt.

24:30.957 --> 24:32.424
You know what? I'm gonna go.

24:32.726 --> 24:33.750
Ow!

24:34.761 --> 24:37.059
Excuse me, what just happened here?

24:39.432 --> 24:42.868
- Thanks for a memorable night.
- I was just kidding!

24:51.444 --> 24:55.380
So that is your idea of
a qualified childcare professional?

24:55.415 --> 24:57.076
Oh, my God, he is completely qualified.

24:57.117 --> 24:59.608
He's a former model
and he's done diaper commercials.

25:00.887 --> 25:02.047
Okay, honestly,

25:02.222 --> 25:05.555
I thought that Manny Poppins
might help you get your groove back.

25:05.592 --> 25:07.423
You know, so that you can sleep better.

25:07.460 --> 25:10.020
What are you implying?
My groove is perfectly fine.

25:10.063 --> 25:12.224
Willie, I keep your appointments,
remember?

25:12.265 --> 25:16.598
And I haven't scheduled you
for one of your weekly car washes

25:17.269 --> 25:18.736
since before Connor.

25:19.705 --> 25:24.108
And I just thought that
James could wash your car for you.

25:24.143 --> 25:25.735
That's the most ridiculous thing
I've ever heard!

25:25.778 --> 25:28.679
Oh, come on! He is totally hot.
He looks like Taye Diggs.

25:28.714 --> 25:30.944
What is it with white people
and Taye Diggs?

25:31.050 --> 25:33.143
Okay, fine, I will call another nanny.

25:33.185 --> 25:34.982
Wait.

25:35.421 --> 25:40.222
He does already know the apartment,
so he can stay for now.

25:40.259 --> 25:41.283
Okay.

25:41.493 --> 25:43.791
And book me a Brazilian with Jeane.

25:43.862 --> 25:45.227
Oh.

25:45.598 --> 25:47.293
Completely unrelated.

25:54.106 --> 25:56.870
It went horribly.
- What? Our moves didn't work?

25:56.909 --> 25:59.810
Impossible! Those moves are patented.
You must have done something wrong.

25:59.845 --> 26:01.710
- Did you do the hair flip?
- Or use the ladle?

26:01.747 --> 26:04.682
Guys, don't worry,
it wasn't your moves, it was me.

26:04.717 --> 26:06.274
The whole night was a disaster.

26:06.317 --> 26:09.650
I practically threw myself at him,
and he ran out the door.

26:09.721 --> 26:12.918
Running away from a girl, screaming?
That sounds like my prom night.

26:13.491 --> 26:15.584
- Oh, my God, he's gay.
- Or a virgin!

26:15.660 --> 26:17.855
- Or a woman!
- Hmm. That feels right.

26:18.096 --> 26:20.030
Well, I just...
I want to talk to him about it,

26:20.064 --> 26:23.090
but I can't because he just texted me,
and he's working through lunch.

26:23.868 --> 26:25.893
That does not fly with me.

26:26.170 --> 26:28.468
If I were you, I would march over
to his office right now

26:28.506 --> 26:29.632
and give him a piece of my mind.

26:29.674 --> 26:31.801
Betty's not the type
to do something like that.

26:31.843 --> 26:33.174
You know what? I'm going to.

26:33.211 --> 26:35.702
Wow, aren't you full of surprises?

26:35.747 --> 26:39.114
I just... I can't take another second
of replaying last night in my head.

26:39.150 --> 26:41.744
I'll go nuts. I just need to talk to him.

26:41.953 --> 26:43.147
Right after you buy us lunch.

26:46.658 --> 26:48.091
That's Matt's building.

26:48.593 --> 26:51.084
I don't know what I'm gonna say to him.
What am I gonna say to him?

26:51.162 --> 26:53.687
Well, you better think fast, because
Richie Rich just left the building.

26:54.832 --> 26:56.356
No. Amanda!

26:58.502 --> 27:00.902
Someone's
not working through lunch.

27:00.937 --> 27:04.236
- You should follow him.
- No. Guys, I'm not going to do that.

27:04.274 --> 27:06.799
- Well, if you don't, then we will.
- Yeah.

27:06.843 --> 27:08.777
No, no. Amanda! Marc!

27:09.880 --> 27:11.040
Oh, God.

27:12.716 --> 27:16.277
He's gonna see you, guys.
Slow down! God.

27:25.362 --> 27:28.695
This is stupid. Why are we doing this?

27:28.732 --> 27:31.132
<i>I know. I just wanna finish
this episode of Mex in the City</i>

27:31.168 --> 27:33.466
and get something to eat.
My stomach is eating itself.

27:34.438 --> 27:36.201
The bagel has landed.

27:38.275 --> 27:39.367
Hey.

27:41.111 --> 27:45.343
Oh, my God.
He is totally two-timing you!

27:49.785 --> 27:51.719
There's gotta be an explanation for this.

27:51.754 --> 27:55.212
Let's get this show
on the road! I'm starving!

27:59.829 --> 28:00.955
Betty?

28:02.064 --> 28:03.554
Betty, what are you doing here?

28:05.668 --> 28:07.795
Oh, I think it's a beautiful day.

28:09.138 --> 28:10.230
Matt!

28:10.906 --> 28:14.643
Hey. Hi.

28:14.643 --> 28:17.009
I didn't mean to follow you.

28:18.180 --> 28:21.513
I'm just still a little confused
about last night.

28:21.584 --> 28:27.284
And if you're with her, that's fine...
I mean, it's not fine, but...

28:28.457 --> 28:30.516
God, I wish I wasn't here right now.

28:31.093 --> 28:33.186
- I'm Helen.
- My therapist.

28:34.096 --> 28:35.290
Why don't you join us?

28:44.205 --> 28:46.139
Betty, sorry I said
I have to work through lunch.

28:46.775 --> 28:48.743
I just needed to see Helen.

28:52.781 --> 28:54.681
I don't... I don't know
what I'm supposed to say.

28:55.216 --> 28:59.846
You can say or not say
anything you want to say or not say.

29:01.589 --> 29:02.578
Okay.

29:04.993 --> 29:07.826
So, about last night...

29:07.862 --> 29:09.420
Look, Matt, it was my fault.

29:09.931 --> 29:11.956
I was trying to push you
into doing something

29:12.000 --> 29:15.265
- you obviously don't want to do...
- No, no, no, that's not it at all...

29:15.303 --> 29:18.500
Matt, it's fine. Just tell me
if you're not attracted to me,

29:18.540 --> 29:20.064
or if you'd rather just stay friends.

29:20.108 --> 29:22.076
No, I am attracted to you.

29:22.510 --> 29:23.568
Well, then what is it?

29:26.681 --> 29:29.707
- Oh, God, this is so embarrassing.
- Why?

29:32.553 --> 29:33.542
Oh.

29:34.721 --> 29:35.915
Are you a virgin?

29:36.557 --> 29:39.219
That's okay. I don't really have
that much experience either...

29:39.259 --> 29:41.250
No, no, I've been with women.

29:42.596 --> 29:45.565
Kind of a lot of women.

29:46.567 --> 29:48.296
I mean, really a lot.

29:49.503 --> 29:50.561
Wow.

29:51.839 --> 29:55.172
Look, look, I know
this must sound weird. It's just...

29:56.143 --> 29:58.407
I've been kind of lonely my whole life.

29:58.478 --> 30:01.311
In the past, Matt has used sex
as a way to connect to people.

30:01.348 --> 30:05.148
So I made a contract with Helen
that I wouldn't be with someone

30:05.185 --> 30:07.915
until I really connected with them first.

30:08.455 --> 30:11.788
Then this amazing thing happened.

30:11.825 --> 30:16.228
I met you, and I started having
all these feelings.

30:17.297 --> 30:20.960
And then when the sex came up,
I guess I just... I just panicked.

30:23.269 --> 30:24.497
And how do you feel now?

30:27.540 --> 30:30.509
Calm. I feel calm.

30:30.743 --> 30:31.801
Good.

30:31.844 --> 30:33.277
I'm just so glad it's out in the open.

30:35.314 --> 30:37.782
And Betty? How do you feel?

30:41.554 --> 30:42.680
Great!

30:43.222 --> 30:44.553
I feel...

30:46.959 --> 30:48.085
Strange.

30:48.728 --> 30:50.389
Matt's been with hundreds of women?

30:50.429 --> 30:54.798
Well, he didn't say hundreds, but
he's definitely pointing in that direction.

30:54.834 --> 30:57.962
Man, what a dog.
I'm not really helping, am I?

30:58.004 --> 30:59.972
No, you're not.
Can we change the subject?

31:00.006 --> 31:01.098
Your car's coming to pick you up

31:01.140 --> 31:02.732
to take you straight
to the poetry club from here.

31:02.775 --> 31:04.208
Great. You're coming, right?

31:04.243 --> 31:07.337
Yeah, yep, I'll be there. I'm excited
to hear Molly read her poem.

31:07.546 --> 31:09.173
She's not gonna read
that one anymore.

31:09.382 --> 31:12.283
- Why? It's so beautiful.
- I asked her not to.

31:12.485 --> 31:14.543
- What?
- Well, you saw what it was about.

31:14.619 --> 31:16.985
I can't exactly have her reading stuff
about our sex life

31:17.022 --> 31:18.353
in front of everyone I work with.

31:18.556 --> 31:19.818
Daniel, sorry to break it to you,

31:19.858 --> 31:22.622
but your sex life has kind of been
on display for years.

31:22.661 --> 31:24.128
Come on, that's different.

31:24.162 --> 31:27.097
Why? Because you don't mind
people knowing that you're a playboy,

31:27.132 --> 31:29.191
but you don't want anyone
to know that you cry

31:29.234 --> 31:30.826
when you're with the woman you love?

31:30.869 --> 31:32.837
Okay, you're making me sound
like an ass.

31:32.871 --> 31:34.498
Well, you kind of are.

31:34.806 --> 31:38.902
Sorry, but Molly's sick and she wrote
a poem about how much she loves you.

31:39.611 --> 31:42.705
And she's brave enough to stand up
in front of strangers and say that.

31:43.481 --> 31:45.210
You can be brave enough to let her.

31:54.759 --> 31:57.125
So we talked it through
and Archie's coming over.

31:57.162 --> 31:59.926
Hilda, you called a guy back
and apologized?

32:00.365 --> 32:02.629
Wow, you must really like this Archie.

32:02.667 --> 32:05.191
I know! Something happened last night.

32:05.235 --> 32:08.170
It's like we really...
We really connected, you know?

32:08.872 --> 32:10.703
And then we didn't disconnect
for like an hour.

32:12.509 --> 32:14.636
Can we maybe not talk
about sex tonight?

32:14.812 --> 32:17.212
Honey, you and Matt,
you're gonna be fine.

32:17.247 --> 32:20.580
I don't know, Hilda.
I mean, a couple days ago,

32:20.617 --> 32:22.084
I was ready to spend the night.

32:22.686 --> 32:25.553
And now I hope
it doesn't even come up.

32:25.589 --> 32:29.355
Honey, he talks to his shrink about you.
Obviously, you are important to him.

32:29.393 --> 32:31.987
It's just complicated.
Now I'm one of hundreds.

32:32.429 --> 32:33.657
I don't feel very special.

32:33.697 --> 32:36.495
Wouldn't it be great
if all of life's problems

32:36.533 --> 32:38.000
could be solved with good hair?

32:38.135 --> 32:39.193
All right, cover up.

32:41.572 --> 32:43.938
That must be Archie! Come in!

32:46.844 --> 32:48.641
Felissa! What are you doing here?

32:48.979 --> 32:50.810
I came to tell you to back off my man.

32:51.148 --> 32:54.481
- Excuse me?
- I decided I want Archie back.

32:54.518 --> 32:55.507
Oh.

32:56.220 --> 32:57.686
Sorry, you can't have him.

32:57.854 --> 33:00.118
No offense, but you can't stop me.

33:00.423 --> 33:02.948
Archie loves him
some vanilla ice-cream.

33:03.426 --> 33:06.088
- Okay, you know, maybe...
- Well, no offense,

33:06.129 --> 33:09.030
but I don't think Archie's
gonna go back to vanilla

33:09.265 --> 33:13.964
when he has tasted
hot melted caramel surprise.

33:14.003 --> 33:16.335
What's the surprise? Your fat ass?

33:16.372 --> 33:17.862
- Oh, no, you did not.
- No, no, no!

33:17.907 --> 33:19.374
Hilda, Hilda, she didn't mean that.

33:19.409 --> 33:21.900
Yes, I did. And I also meant to do this.

33:25.148 --> 33:26.445
- Bitch!
- How you like that?

33:26.482 --> 33:28.916
Hope you like eggs, 'cause your head's
about to look like one!

33:28.951 --> 33:30.213
- No, no! Hilda!
- Yes!

33:30.253 --> 33:33.188
- That's all you got?
- At least let me get these eyebrows!

33:33.222 --> 33:37.454
You're gonna hurt somebody!
Stop! Stop! Are you crazy?

33:37.493 --> 33:39.552
What the hell is going on here?

33:52.607 --> 33:56.703
It's a little chilly in here.
Do you mind if I start a fire?

33:56.978 --> 33:57.967
Sure.

34:06.488 --> 34:07.921
Mmm.

34:14.795 --> 34:18.197
Oh, it looks like you have
a little something on your shirt.

34:18.400 --> 34:22.335
Oh. I guess the baby spit up a little.
It's no big deal.

34:22.370 --> 34:27.137
Nonsense. Let me wash it.
I was just about to do a load of laundry.

34:28.677 --> 34:29.871
Okay.

34:30.277 --> 34:31.835
<i>On the counter</i>

34:32.746 --> 34:34.510
<i>By your keys</i>

34:35.317 --> 34:37.751
<i>Was a book of numbers</i>

34:37.985 --> 34:39.679
<i>And your remedies</i>

34:39.719 --> 34:40.914
Thank you.

34:41.222 --> 34:42.882
You're welcome. Thank you.

34:43.157 --> 34:45.887
<i>Surely will screen out the sorrow</i>

34:46.193 --> 34:50.527
<i>But where are you tomorrow?</i>

34:51.297 --> 34:53.027
<i>Thank you. Thank you.</i>

34:57.371 --> 35:00.499
Hey, hey. I'm really glad
that we talked with Helen today.

35:00.541 --> 35:03.009
I mean, it was weird, but I'm glad.

35:03.043 --> 35:05.136
Yeah. Yep, me, too.

35:11.018 --> 35:12.076
Who was that?

35:12.119 --> 35:14.519
Oh. She works at a coffee shop
near my apartment.

35:16.223 --> 35:17.349
Hey, hey.

35:17.391 --> 35:19.859
That's the only place I know her from,
just in case you were wondering.

35:19.894 --> 35:23.523
What? No, no.
I wasn't wondering anything.

35:28.002 --> 35:33.439
Your shirt will be done soon.
So, in the meantime, why don't we...

35:34.107 --> 35:36.940
<i>My only sunshine</i>

35:37.010 --> 35:42.312
<i>You make me happy
when skies are gray</i>

35:42.348 --> 35:45.545
<i>You'll never know, dear</i>

35:45.585 --> 35:46.847
<i>How much I love you...</i>

35:50.290 --> 35:51.723
Are you okay?

35:53.359 --> 35:54.690
I'm fine!

35:58.464 --> 36:02.059
"And there I sit
Wrapped oh so tight against the night

36:02.802 --> 36:07.762
"In my insecurity blanket"

36:12.645 --> 36:13.976
Molly.

36:14.614 --> 36:17.310
Hey, I'm so sorry
about what I said before.

36:17.350 --> 36:20.513
This poem you wrote is beautiful
and it's touching,

36:21.354 --> 36:23.378
and I'd be so proud
to hear you read it tonight.

36:23.755 --> 36:24.847
You would?

36:27.926 --> 36:29.052
<i>Molly, you're up!</i>

36:29.194 --> 36:30.252
Hmm.

36:30.295 --> 36:32.388
- Get 'em! Take it!
- Okay.

36:35.167 --> 36:39.297
I'm just so angry at myself.
I knew I shouldn't have let Connor in.

36:39.838 --> 36:41.965
It went against every instinct I had.

36:42.407 --> 36:46.309
Now I can't get his stupid face
out of my dreams!

36:49.348 --> 36:52.044
That's it. That's it. Let it out.

36:52.084 --> 36:55.611
I don't want to let it out.
I just want to have sex.

36:58.223 --> 36:59.485
I didn't... I didn't...

36:59.524 --> 37:01.492
Just take your pants off.

37:01.526 --> 37:03.756
I don't think what you need is sex.

37:04.630 --> 37:08.623
What I think you need is to find a way
to close the door on this Connor guy.

37:08.834 --> 37:10.802
And focus on your baby.

37:14.905 --> 37:16.896
Well, thank you, James.

37:21.012 --> 37:23.674
I think you really helped me.

37:24.415 --> 37:27.714
And since we won't be having sex,
now you're fired.

37:29.320 --> 37:30.344
Get out.

37:31.656 --> 37:32.987
- Can I get my shirt?
- Out.

37:40.231 --> 37:41.698
<i>- Okay, good job, Molly!
- Hi.</i>

37:41.732 --> 37:43.097
<i>Evan, you're up next.</i>

37:43.134 --> 37:44.965
- Thanks, guys.
- Oh, great, thank you.

37:52.376 --> 37:56.938
<i>Matt. Matt.</i>

38:03.821 --> 38:05.117
Betty? Betty? Are you okay?

38:06.122 --> 38:10.218
Sorry.
I'm gonna go say bye to Daniel.

38:21.304 --> 38:23.033
- Did you finally get rid of her?
- Yeah,

38:23.106 --> 38:25.939
and don't worry, Felissa won't
bother you anymore, I promise.

38:25.975 --> 38:28.239
Oh! I know.

38:28.578 --> 38:31.069
So, what's going on here?

38:31.147 --> 38:34.173
Yesterday, you're not into me,
and today, you're fighting for me.

38:34.217 --> 38:35.844
I thought I wasn't your type.

38:35.885 --> 38:38.649
Okay, I know.
It was a really dumb thing to say.

38:39.322 --> 38:43.486
Especially since my type hasn't
really worked out for me so well.

38:44.694 --> 38:48.892
I just wanted to see what it would
be like, you know, with a nice guy.

38:50.200 --> 38:51.497
Hilda, I like you.

38:51.534 --> 38:53.764
But I'm starting to worry
I have a type, too.

38:53.803 --> 38:56.464
I think I sort of go for the bad girls.

38:58.073 --> 38:59.438
You think I'm a bad girl?

39:00.342 --> 39:04.574
Well, maybe I'm a little bad,
but you loved it.

39:05.214 --> 39:07.307
Two girls going at it over you...

39:07.349 --> 39:10.750
Please, I'm a grown man.
I hardly think I need to get my thrills...

39:10.786 --> 39:14.085
- You loved it.
- Yeah, I know, it was really hot.

39:17.926 --> 39:20.656
So what are we saying?
We giving this another chance?

39:20.963 --> 39:21.987
Yeah.

39:22.765 --> 39:28.032
Oh, and, by the way,
I'm not always such a nice guy.

39:28.237 --> 39:30.171
I know.

39:32.207 --> 39:33.572
We're home!

39:34.343 --> 39:36.834
Oh, my God.
I'm going to start wearing a bell.

39:45.721 --> 39:47.688
- I liked Molly's poem.
- Yeah.

39:49.190 --> 39:52.159
- Does Daniel cry at work, too?
- Not every day.

39:53.294 --> 39:55.922
- So, I guess I should get a cab.
- Wait. Wait, Betty, wait.

39:55.963 --> 39:59.524
I was thinking maybe
you could come back to my place

39:59.767 --> 40:02.964
and see my new wall color?
I mean, if you want.

40:03.504 --> 40:05.495
Matt, I don't know.

40:06.240 --> 40:08.367
- You're freaked out.
- Yeah.

40:10.178 --> 40:13.773
I just... I want it to be special,

40:13.815 --> 40:17.307
and I'm sorry, but right now I just...
I feel like a number.

40:17.351 --> 40:19.512
You are. Number one.

40:19.554 --> 40:22.284
- Come on, Matt. I'm serious.
- No, so am I.

40:22.323 --> 40:27.590
Betty, this will be the first time
that I have ever been with a woman

40:27.628 --> 40:29.619
I really care about.

40:30.465 --> 40:33.366
So, technically, you are my first.

40:34.936 --> 40:36.130
Aw.

40:36.471 --> 40:39.530
That's so corny. And sweet.

40:41.641 --> 40:43.871
Now I'm making myself nervous.
My hands are shaking.

40:43.910 --> 40:46.538
No, don't worry. So are mine.

41:03.763 --> 41:05.526
This one goes out to the woman I love,

41:06.066 --> 41:09.092
a classic from my high school
Battle of the Bands.

41:12.005 --> 41:15.031
<i>We're driving down the highway</i>

41:15.108 --> 41:17.235
<i>Cool wind in my hair</i>

41:18.111 --> 41:20.875
<i>Just me and my special lady</i>

41:21.181 --> 41:25.845
<i>We haven't got a care in the world</i>

41:30.122 --> 41:32.556
<i>But the road ahead's uncertain</i>

41:32.591 --> 41:35.287
<i>There'll be bumps along the way</i>

41:35.961 --> 41:38.691
<i>And I know there'll be some hurtin'</i>

41:38.731 --> 41:44.465
<i>So I hit the gas and pray</i>

41:46.639 --> 41:49.665
<i>I don't wanna crash and burn</i>

41:50.042 --> 41:53.011
<i>Don't wanna go too fast</i>

41:53.045 --> 41:55.275
<i>I wanna be with you</i>

41:55.314 --> 41:58.545
<i>Wanna see this through</i>

41:58.584 --> 42:01.951
<i>I don't wanna crash and burn</i>

42:01.987 --> 42:04.888
<i>Don't wanna go too fast</i>

42:04.924 --> 42:08.189
<i>I want to be with you</i>

42:08.661 --> 42:14.031
<i>Wanna make this last forever</i>

42:16.101 --> 42:20.003
<i>And ever, my lady</i>

42:21.305 --> 42:27.710
