OKAY!
[honking horn]

07:38.310 --> 07:40.175
SEE YOU THURSDAY, SWEETHEART!

07:40.320 --> 07:41.480
- LOVE YOU!

07:46.320 --> 07:47.901
- IT'S REALLY WEIRD.
- THAT'S SO WEIRD.

07:48.050 --> 07:49.256
WAS HE, LIKE, OLD-LOOKING,
OR IS HE JUST THE SAME?

07:49.390 --> 07:52.041
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
I MEAN, HE LOOKED LIKE MR. CYR.

07:52.190 --> 07:54.158
HE HAD THE SAME, LIKE, WEIRD
MUSTACHE-Y THING, YOU KNOW?

07:54.300 --> 07:56.222
HE'S NOT BALD, YOU KNOW,
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE ASKING.

07:56.370 --> 07:57.598
IT'S BEEN, LIKE, A YEAR.

07:57.750 --> 07:58.774
- I KNOW, BUT A YEAR...
[phone rings]

07:58.920 --> 08:00.330
AND TEACHERS...
I MEAN, A LOT CAN HAPPEN.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.402
- HELLO?

08:02.550 --> 08:06.543
HEY, UNCLE JOEL.
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

08:06.690 --> 08:08.544
OH.

08:08.690 --> 08:10.169
YOU KNOW,
I WOULD LOVE TO,

08:10.310 --> 08:11.277
BUT I'M WORKING LATE TODAY,

08:11.420 --> 08:15.038
SO I CAN'T, BUT--

08:15.180 --> 08:17.068
BUT DREW COULD DO IT.

08:17.220 --> 08:18.289
- YEAH, NO, NO,
HE'S ACTUALLY SITTING

08:18.420 --> 08:19.455
RIGHT HERE
IN FRONT OF ME.

08:19.600 --> 08:22.592
NOPE,
HE IS FREE AS A BIRD.

08:22.740 --> 08:23.832
NO PLANS.

08:23.980 --> 08:24.776
NO PLANS AT ALL.
- HOW DO YOU KNOW?

08:24.910 --> 08:26.491
I'M NOT DOING IT.
- UH-HUH.

08:26.640 --> 08:27.732
- I'M OUT.
- YEAH, HE'S EXCITED.

08:27.880 --> 08:28.778
- I'M NOT DOING IT.
- OKAY, GREAT.

08:28.920 --> 08:32.219
4:00, BYE-BYE.
- WHA--DO WHAT?

08:32.370 --> 08:34.747
- YOU'RE BABY-SITTING
FOR SYDNEY AND VICTOR.

08:34.890 --> 08:36.710
- OH, MY GOSH.
BABY-SIT THEM?

08:36.860 --> 08:38.168
- YEAH.
- THEY HATE ME.

08:38.310 --> 08:40.198
- DON'T BE A DRAMA QUEEN.
- THERE'S NO COMMON INTERESTS.

08:40.340 --> 08:41.898
- NO COMMON INTERESTS?
- THEY DON'T LIKE ME.

08:42.030 --> 08:43.725
- IT'S NOT eHARMONY.
IT'S CHILDREN.

08:43.860 --> 08:45.999
PLAY A GAME WITH THEM.
- I'M NOT DOING IT.

08:46.140 --> 08:49.200
- DREW, YOU'RE DOING IT.
4:00.

08:52.730 --> 08:54.482
- BEAUTIFUL FRAMING JOB.
- YEAH, THERE YOU GO.

08:54.630 --> 08:55.494
- I LOVE IT.
- I DON'T KNOW.

08:55.630 --> 08:56.665
HANGING A PICTURE
OF A BROCHURE

08:56.810 --> 08:57.458
IS A LITTLE WEIRD,
BUT ALL RIGHT.

08:57.600 --> 08:58.806
- DON'T CALL IT A BROCHURE.

08:58.950 --> 09:00.872
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL PICTURE
THAT WAS IN A BROCHURE

09:01.020 --> 09:01.975
THAT WAS
OUR FIRST BIG JOB.

09:02.120 --> 09:03.803
CHEERS.
- OH, YEAH.

09:03.950 --> 09:04.917
A COUPLE MORE JOBS TOO.
THAT'S--

09:05.060 --> 09:07.221
- I KNOW, HUH?
THE TWO OF US.

09:07.370 --> 09:09.099
WE'RE A REGULAR TEAM.
- THAT'S HARD TO BELIEVE.

09:09.230 --> 09:10.436
- [chuckles]
- I GOTTA BE HONEST.

09:10.580 --> 09:11.888
I DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS GONNA WORK.

09:12.030 --> 09:13.577
- REALLY? YOU HAD A NEGATIVE
OUTLOOK ABOUT SOMETHING?

09:13.720 --> 09:16.200
IT'S A SHOCKER.
- YEAH, DIDN'T, UH...

09:16.340 --> 09:18.615
THE WHOLE THING'S
KINDA WORKIN' OUT,

09:18.760 --> 09:22.309
JUST SPENDING TIME WORKING,
EVEN JUST HANGING OUT TOGETHER.

09:22.450 --> 09:24.623
IT'S BEEN PRETTY GOOD.

09:24.770 --> 09:26.214
[knock at door]

09:26.350 --> 09:28.238
TH E--TH E--YOU KNOW,

09:28.390 --> 09:30.312

NO, THE--NO, THE WORKING, YEAH.

09:30.460 --> 09:32.382
HOLD ON ONE SEC.

09:32.530 --> 09:33.451
HI!

09:33.600 --> 09:35.659
- YESTERDAY, I SAW MR. CYR.

09:35.810 --> 09:37.675
- [gaSPSI
- MARK CYR, MR. MARK.

09:37.810 --> 09:39.152
- OH, NO KIDDING.
HEY, HANK'S HERE.

09:39.300 --> 09:41.222
COME ON IN.

09:41.370 --> 09:42.678
- HEY.
- HI.

09:42.820 --> 09:45.288
HOW ARE YOU?
- GOOD.

09:45.440 --> 09:47.431
- SO WHAT WE WERE CELEBRATING:

09:47.580 --> 09:49.400
WE FINISHED OUR JOB,
AND THEN WE GOT THIS NEW JOB

09:49.550 --> 09:51.609
FOR AN ORGANIC SKINCARE COMPANY.

09:51.760 --> 09:52.829
DO YOU WANT
A GLASS OF CHAMPAGNE?

09:52.970 --> 09:54.653
- OH, NO, DEFINITELY NOT.
NO.

09:54.800 --> 09:55.960
- COOL.
BUT YOU CAN'T STAY?

09:56.110 --> 09:58.487
- I CAN'T
BECAUSE IT'S LATE, SO...

09:58.630 --> 09:59.619
- ALL RIGHT.
SEE YOU.

09:59.770 --> 10:01.488
- TEXT ME FROM THE CAR.
- OKAY.

10:01.630 --> 10:03.177
- MORE CHAMPAGNE?

10:03.320 --> 10:05.459
- WE TAKE MATTERS OF BULLYING
VERY SERIOUSLY, MRS. BRAVERMAN.

10:05.600 --> 10:07.830
WE'RE DOING
EVERYTHING WE CAN

10:07.980 --> 10:09.390
TO GET TO THE BOTTOM
OF WHAT HAPPENED.

10:09.530 --> 10:10.701
- WELL, WHAT HAPPENED WAS

10:10.850 --> 10:12.875
SOMEBODY PEED
IN MY SON'S CANTEEN, SO--

10:13.020 --> 10:14.123
- HE WAS TRAUMATIZED BY IT.
- HE IS TRAUMATIZED.

10:14.260 --> 10:15.329
- I UNDERSTAND.

10:15.470 --> 10:16.323
BUT AS OF YET,
NO ONE HAS COME FORWARD

10:16.470 --> 10:18.529
AND ADMITTED TO THE INCIDENT.

10:18.680 --> 10:20.193
- WELL, OF COURSE THEY HAVEN'T.

10:20.340 --> 10:22.023
WELL, MAX HAS
A PRETTY GOOD IDEA WHO DID IT.

10:22.170 --> 10:24.513
- YOU CAN'T JUST START MAKING
ACCUSATIONS WITHOUT PROOF.

10:24.650 --> 10:25.787
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL
IF YOUR CHILD WERE ACCUSED

10:25.930 --> 10:27.784
OF SOMETHING
THAT HE DIDN'T DO?

10:27.930 --> 10:30.069
- I CA--I'M SORRY.
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

10:30.210 --> 10:31.939
HE'S THE KID WHO HAD
HIS CANTEEN PEED IN.

10:32.070 --> 10:34.106
HONEY, I'M REALLY TRYING
HARD TO KEEP MY COOL HERE,

10:34.250 --> 10:35.797
BUT I GOTTA SAY YOUR RESPONSE
TO THIS REALLY BLOWS.

10:35.940 --> 10:37.350
- OH, BOY.
- THIS Is A SERIOUS INCIDENT.

10:37.490 --> 10:38.479
AND NOBODY'S BLAMING YOU,
MR. KNIGHT.

10:38.630 --> 10:39.767
YOU DID EVERYTHING YOU COULD.

10:39.910 --> 10:40.979
YOU CAN'T WATCH EVERYBODY,
BUT, YOU KNOW,

10:41.120 --> 10:42.451
THIS WAS
AN OFFICIAL SCHOOL TRIP.

10:42.600 --> 10:43.498
IT HAPPENED ON YOUR WATCH,
AND I'M EXPECTING YOU

10:43.640 --> 10:45.289
TO TAKE SOME RESPONSIBILITY.

10:45.430 --> 10:48.558
- EXCUSE ME,
PRINCIPAL RADFORD, IF I MAY.

10:48.710 --> 10:50.120
I-I HAVE
TO SAY THAT I AGREE

10:50.270 --> 10:51.498
WITH MR.
AND MRS. BRAVERMAN HERE.

10:51.650 --> 10:53.641
WE CAN'T ACCEPT THIS.
WE CAN'T.

10:53.790 --> 10:54.927
WE GOTTA
GET MAX BACK HERE.

10:55.060 --> 10:56.641
IF WE FAIL ONE KID,
WE FAIL AS A SCHOOL.

10:56.790 --> 10:57.927
- THANK YOU.

10:58.070 --> 10:59.958
THANK YOU, MR. KNIGHT.
HE'S RIGHT.

11:00.100 --> 11:01.442
- I UNDERSTAND YOUR PASSION,
MR. KNIGHT.

11:01.590 --> 11:02.921
AND I UNDERSTAND
YOU WANT THIS

11:03.070 --> 11:04.173
RESOLVED IMMEDIATELY,
MR. AND MRS. BRAVERMAN,

11:04.310 --> 11:05.345
BUT IT WILL TAKE TIME.
- OKAY, I GOT THAT...

11:05.490 --> 11:08.175
- IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE IT.
- BUT WHAT ARE WE

11:08.320 --> 11:09.833
SUPPOSED TO DO AS PARENTS
IN THE MEANTIME?

11:09.970 --> 11:11.073
HE DOESN'T
WANNA COME TO SCHOOL.

11:11.220 --> 11:12.312
- WE WANNA GET HIM
BACK IN THE CLASSROOM.

11:12.460 --> 11:15.497
- HE'S REFUSING.
SO WHAT DO WE TELL HIM?

11:15.640 --> 11:18.040
- WELL, AS--
AS THE DEAN HERE,

11:18.190 --> 11:19.282
MY FEELING IS
SINCE THERE'S ONLY

11:19.430 --> 11:21.876
ONE MONTH LEI-T
OF THE SCHOOL YEAR

11:22.020 --> 11:25.296
AND SINCE THIS IS
MAX'S GRADUATION YEAR ANYWAY,

11:25.440 --> 11:27.328
MAYBE WE DON'T
PUSH MAX TO RETURN TO SCHOOL

11:27.470 --> 11:30.849
BEFORE HE'S REALLY READY.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.570
- OKAY.
OKAY.

11:32.720 --> 11:33.857
SO THAT'S YOUR SOLUTION...

11:34.000 --> 11:35.968
TO KEEP MAX AT HOME?

11:36.100 --> 11:37.340
KEEP MY SON AT HOME,

11:37.480 --> 11:39.061
NOT THE KID
THAT PISSED IN HIS CANTEEN.

11:39.210 --> 11:41.030
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK.
THEY'RE NOT GONNA DEAL WITH IT.

11:41.180 --> 11:42.693
- YOU'RE GONNA PUNISH MY KID--
- LET'S JUST GO.

11:42.840 --> 11:44.489
- THIS IS ASININE.
THIS IS--THIS WHOLE--NO.

11:44.630 --> 11:47.428
THIS WHOLE CONVERSATION
IS USELESS, OKAY?

11:47.560 --> 11:49.664
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
I'M SO GLAD THAT YOU ARE HERE.

11:49.810 --> 11:52.904
THIS--YOU AND YOU--
THIS WHOLE SITUATION IS USELESS.

11:53.050 --> 11:54.256
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

11:54.400 --> 11:55.799
HAVE A GOOD DAY.
DON'T LAUGH AT ME.

11:55.950 --> 11:57.986
- I'M NOT LAUGHING.

12:00.440 --> 12:01.361
- WELL...

12:02.370 --> 12:04.019
- IT'S BEEN THREE WHOLE DAYS.

12:04.170 --> 12:06.092
- IS THAT RIGHT?
- YEAH, IT'S RIGHT.

12:06.240 --> 12:07.992
LIVING IN TOTAL DARKNESS...
- TOTAL DARKNESS?

12:08.140 --> 12:09.994
- AND THE CATALOGUES
HAVE BEEN PILING UP

12:10.140 --> 12:11.448
DOWNSTAIRS BY THE MAILBOXES.
[cell phone rIngs]

12:11.590 --> 12:13.899
- I PROMISE I'LL TAKE--
I'LL TAKE CARE OF THAT.

12:14.040 --> 12:14.961
- JUST A LOT OF PROMISES,
SWEETHEART.

12:15.110 --> 12:16.486
- EXCUSE ME.
- I JUST THINK

12:16.630 --> 12:19.599
THAT YOUR HEAD HASN'T
BEEN INTO YOUR WORK LATELY.

12:19.730 --> 12:21.482
- HELLO?

12:21.630 --> 12:23.666
- HEY.

12:23.810 --> 12:26.392
UH, HEY, IT'S--IT'S MARK.

12:31.990 --> 12:35.505
I HOPE IT'S OKAY
TO, YOU KNOW, CALL YOU.

12:35.650 --> 12:36.958
UM, UM...

12:37.100 --> 12:40.809
- I THINK IT'S--
SURE, IT'S FINE.

12:40.960 --> 12:42.131
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?
- WELL, I--

12:42.270 --> 12:43.510
I DON'T KNOW
IF AMBER TOLD YOU

12:43.650 --> 12:45.891
THAT I-I RAN INTO HER...

12:46.040 --> 12:47.541
- OH, YEAH, NO,
SHE TOLD ME THAT.

12:47.690 --> 12:49.829
THAT WAS WEIRD.
THAT'S--THAT'S SO WILD.

12:49.970 --> 12:51.176
- IT WAS WEIRD, YEAH,
BUT SH E--

12:51.320 --> 12:54.039
SHE LOOKS--SHE LOOKS GREAT.
SHE SEEMS GOOD.

12:54.180 --> 12:56.421
- YEAH, SHE'S DOING GOOD
LIKE--LIKE YOU SAID.

12:56.560 --> 13:01.111

I WAS WONDERING IF, UH...

13:03.880 --> 13:06.747
I REALLY NEED TALK TO YOU,
AND, UM...

13:06.880 --> 13:08.984
I-I DON'T WANNA
DO IT ON THE PHONE.

13:09.130 --> 13:12.099
CAN WE MEET,
DO YOU THINK?

13:13.680 --> 13:15.193
- OF COURSE.

13:15.340 --> 13:16.614
- OKAY.

13:16.760 --> 13:18.819
OKAY.

13:28.910 --> 13:31.003

13:33.190 --> 13:35.397
- OKAY.
DAD, DAD, DAD--

13:35.530 --> 13:36.189
- DON'T TURN IT OFF.

13:36.330 --> 13:38.946
- DO NOT TURN IT OFF.

13:39.090 --> 13:42.253
- IT'S A'BREAKIN'
MY EARS, PLEASE!

13:42.400 --> 13:43.674

OR WHAT, CROS?

13:47.130 --> 13:49.439

IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY.

13:49.580 --> 13:52.094
- OPEN ROAD.

13:52.240 --> 13:54.891
- MM-HMM.

13:55.040 --> 13:57.247
AND DESERTS
AND MOUNTAINS AND PALM TREES.

13:57.380 --> 13:59.132
- THIS LAND WAS MADE
FOR YOU AND ME.

13:59.280 --> 14:01.009
DAD, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA
DO ABOUT THE HOUSE?

14:01.150 --> 14:04.449
WHAT ARE YOU THINKIN'?

14:04.600 --> 14:07.387
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

14:07.530 --> 14:08.838
- YOUR--YOUR HOUSE,
YOU KNOW,

14:08.980 --> 14:10.845
THE ONE YOU GOTTA DECIDE
WHETHER OR NOT

14:10.980 --> 14:12.015
YOU'RE GONNA SELL
WITHIN THE NEXT 52 HOURS,

14:12.160 --> 14:14.879
THAT HOUSE?

14:15.020 --> 14:17.841
- YEAH.
- WELL, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

14:17.990 --> 14:22.199
- WELL, TO BE
HONEST WITH YOU, CROS,

14:22.340 --> 14:25.855
UH, I...

14:26.000 --> 14:27.228

14:27.380 --> 14:30.349
DAD?

14:30.490 --> 14:32.867
LOOK!
WE GOT ATVs UP HERE.

14:33.010 --> 14:34.511
OH!

14:34.660 --> 14:36.002
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, PULL OVER!

14:36.150 --> 14:37.344
GET IN THERE!
LET'S DO THIS!

14:37.490 --> 14:38.900
- WE HAVEN'T DONE THIS
SINCE YOU WERE A KID.

14:39.050 --> 14:40.620
- YEAH, HA HA HA!

14:40.770 --> 14:41.737
- YOU ACTUALLY THINK
THE WAITER'S GONNA TELL YOU

14:41.880 --> 14:43.324
WHETHER HE WAS
ON A DATE OR NOT?

14:43.460 --> 14:45.348
- YES, I-I'M GONNA MAKE HIM
TELL ME...

14:45.500 --> 14:47.149
- ALL RIGHT.
- WHAT HE KNOWS.

14:47.300 --> 14:48.187
- IS THERE A POSSIBILITY
IT WAS A BUSINESS DINNER

14:48.330 --> 14:51.538
THAT WENT ON A LONG TIME?

14:51.680 --> 14:53.363
- I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE.
I HOPE SO.

14:53.510 --> 14:57.503
ALL I KNOW
IS THAT IT COST $468

14:57.650 --> 15:00.232
AND THAT IT WAS CHARGED
AFTER MIDNIGHT LAST NIGHT.

15:00.380 --> 15:01.369
- WOW.

15:01.520 --> 15:02.612
OH, FIVE MINUTES.
OKAY.

15:02.760 --> 15:04.375
- OKAY.

15:04.520 --> 15:06.306
- OKAY.
- WELL, IT SEEMS TO ME

15:06.450 --> 15:09.317
THAT YOU SHOULD
BE ABLE TO ASK HIM,

15:09.460 --> 15:13.078
AND HE SHOULD TELL YOU
IF HE WAS ON A DATE.

15:13.220 --> 15:16.212
- YEAH.
I CAN'T DO THAT.

15:16.360 --> 15:17.520
I CAN'T ASK JOEL BECAUSE

15:17.670 --> 15:21.117
HE'S BASICALLY...
NOT TALKING TO ME.

15:21.260 --> 15:22.227
HE'S BEING
VERY SHORT WITH ME.

15:22.360 --> 15:23.702
- STILL?
- YEAH, HE'S MAKING ME FEEL

15:23.850 --> 15:25.249
LIKE ANYTHING THAT'S
NOT IN THE KIDS' SCHEDULES

15:25.400 --> 15:28.221
IS OFF-LIMITS TO TALK ABOUT.
- JULIA, THAT'S HORRIBLE.

15:28.370 --> 15:30.292
- I KNOW, BUT I DON'T--

15:30.440 --> 15:32.305
I JUST--
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

15:32.440 --> 15:33.338
AND SO, I JUST--
I WANNA KNOW.

15:33.480 --> 15:37.405
- WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO HAPPEN?

15:37.550 --> 15:38.585

15:38.730 --> 15:42.109
I WANT...
MY MARRIAGE BACK, YOU KNOW?

15:42.250 --> 15:46.209
BUT, UM...

15:46.350 --> 15:48.215
BUT IF I CAN'T HAVE THAT,
THEN I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW.

15:48.360 --> 15:51.181
- IT SEEMS TO ME
YOU DESERVE TO BE ABLE

15:51.320 --> 15:53.527
TO ASK YOUR HUSBAND
WHAT HE'S BEEN DOING,

15:53.670 --> 15:56.776
AND HE SHOULD
GIVE YOU AN ANSWER.

15:56.920 --> 15:58.364
- YEAH.

16:00.400 --> 16:01.913
YOU'RE TOTALLY RIGHT.

16:24.600 --> 16:26.249

16:32.430 --> 16:33.749
ALSO, THE SNACKS ARE FREE.

16:33.880 --> 16:37.532
I DON'T HAVE TO PAY FOR THEM
IN THE VENDING MACHINE.

16:37.680 --> 16:40.672
- ALL GOOD POINTS.

16:40.820 --> 16:41.991
EXCEPT, YOU KNOW, HERE,

16:42.130 --> 16:46.271
WE DON'T HAVE
ALL THE OTHER KIDS.

16:46.410 --> 16:48.412
- I HATE THE OTHER KIDS.

16:50.660 --> 16:52.343
- I UNDERSTAND.

16:52.490 --> 16:55.459
I HAD SOME PRETTY ROUGH TIMES
IN MIDDLE SCHOOL MYSELF.

16:58.180 --> 17:00.250

17:12.340 --> 17:14.228
IT'S A SURPRISE.

17:14.370 --> 17:16.782

19:47.420 --> 19:48.239
THREE WEEKS

AND I GOT UP
ON MY FIRST DAY.

19:49.390 --> 19:50.482

19:50.630 --> 19:51.870
- HOW WAS YOUR SCHOOLWORK?

- REALLY?

19:53.570 --> 19:54.730
- YES.
- DID HE?

19:54.880 --> 19:56.666
- I HAVE TO CHANGE.

ALL OF HIS SCHOOLWORK.

19:57.950 --> 19:58.700
WE WERE ONLY GONE
A COUPLE OF HOURS.

19:58.850 --> 20:00.363
- HE FINISHED IT?
- YEAH.

20:00.500 --> 20:01.603
- OKAY, WE'RE NOT
SETTING A GOOD EXAMPLE.

20:01.750 --> 20:03.468
YOU CAN'T JUST REWARD HIM
FOR NOT GOING TO SCHOOL.

20:03.610 --> 20:04.770
I KNOW
THIS WHOLE SITUATION IS--

20:04.920 --> 20:06.091
- PLEASE DON'T SAY
THAT I'M SENDING HIM

20:06.230 --> 20:07.470
THE WRONG MESSAGE.
I KNOW WE HAVE

20:07.620 --> 20:08.996
TO BE CAREFUL WITH MAX
WITH THIS SORTA THING,

20:09.130 --> 20:10.472
BUT THE KID
DESERVES A BREAK.

20:10.620 --> 20:11.848
- IT'S NOT A PAID VACATION.
- I KNOW IT'S NOT.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.274
LOOK, I KNOW
WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT

20:13.410 --> 20:14.616
WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH MAX.

20:14.760 --> 20:15.658
I KNOW WE HAVE
TO BE TOGETHER ON THIS.

20:16.900 --> 20:18.344
I NEEDED
TO SEE MY SON BE HAPPY.

20:18.490 --> 20:21.721
I WANTED TO SEE
A SMILE ON HIS FACE.

20:21.870 --> 20:23.451
AND I DID.

20:23.600 --> 20:25.807
- RIGHT.
HE REALLY GOT UP?

20:25.940 --> 20:27.259
- YEAH, HE DID.

20:27.390 --> 20:28.425

20:30.500 --> 20:31.706

- YOU DID.

20:33.710 --> 20:37.225
DON'T DO THAT.
IT'S FINE IF YOU TAKE HIM--

20:42.310 --> 20:44.369
- GO--GET OFF!
IT'S NOT EVEN YOUR TURN!

20:44.510 --> 20:45.829
- YES, IT IS!
GIVE IT TO ME!

20:45.960 --> 20:47.029
YOU'VE BEEN USING IT ALL DAY!

20:47.170 --> 20:49.411
- YES, YOU HAVE!
- HEY, YOU GUYS.

20:49.550 --> 20:51.552
STOP.
STOP!

20:51.690 --> 20:53.066

20:53.210 --> 20:54.768
- I'M NOT STUPID.
- YEAH?

20:54.900 --> 20:56.003
THEN WHY'D YOU GET LEI-T BACK?
- STOP IT!

20:56.150 --> 20:57.902
- I DIDN'T GET LEI-T BACK!
- STOP! STOP!

20:58.040 --> 21:00.622
OKAY, WE'RE NOT
DOING THIS, ALL RIGHT?

21:00.770 --> 21:02.635
WE'RE--WE'RE NOT
PLAYING THE GAME ANYMORE.

21:02.770 --> 21:04.567
JUST GIVE ME THIS.
WE'RE LEAVING, OKAY?

21:04.710 --> 21:05.972
COME ON.

21:12.160 --> 21:16.051
YOU GUYS.

21:20.100 --> 21:23.035
- I THINK IT'S LIKE
THE MOST DEPRESSING

21:23.170 --> 21:24.034
$40 I'VE EVER MADE.

21:24.170 --> 21:27.446
- HMM.
YEAH.

21:27.590 --> 21:28.067
WHAT'S THE APARTMENT LIKE?

21:28.210 --> 21:30.383
- IT'S SAD.

21:30.530 --> 21:33.169
IT'S LIKE A WHOLE COMPLEX
OF UNCLE JOEL'S.

21:33.320 --> 21:35.356
- NO.
- YES.

21:35.500 --> 21:36.000
- HOW ARE THE KIDS
TAKING IT?

21:36.150 --> 21:37.321
- NOT GOOD.

21:37.460 --> 21:39.974
THEY, LIKE,
ARGUE THE WHOLE TIME,

21:40.120 --> 21:43.806
AND THEY--
THEY DON'T WANNA DO ANYTHING.

21:43.950 --> 21:46.919
I MEAN,
WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THAT?

21:47.060 --> 21:48.743
- I MEAN, IT MAKES SENSE.

21:48.890 --> 21:51.051
REMEMBER HOW UNPLEASANT TO BE
AROUND WE WERE WHEN DAD LEI-T?

21:51.200 --> 21:52.815
- YEAH, THAT'S TRUE.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.035
- WELL...

21:58.170 --> 22:00.058
AT LEAST YOU COULD
PAY FOR DINNER THIS TIME.

22:00.210 --> 22:01.063
- YEAH.

22:15.360 --> 22:16.736
- HEY.

22:16.880 --> 22:18.632

22:20.440 --> 22:22.533
- UH, NO.

22:22.680 --> 22:26.616
I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY WEIRD
FOR THE KIDS AND FOR ME.

22:26.750 --> 22:28.570
- YEAH, I GET THAT.
- UM...

22:28.720 --> 22:29.755

- GOOD.

22:54.130 --> 22:56.462
UM...

22:56.610 --> 22:59.363
IF IT WAS A BUSINESS DINNER,
WHY DIDN'T SHE PICK UP THE TAB?

22:59.510 --> 23:00.670
- BECAUSE--

23:00.820 --> 23:03.709
- SORRY.
IT'S--WE'RE SHARING FINANCES.

23:03.860 --> 23:04.713

WE WERE CELEBRATING.

23:07.970 --> 23:10.177
WE HAD JUST
SOLD OUR FIRST HOUSE,

23:10.310 --> 23:10.969
SO I PICKED UP THE TAB.

23:11.110 --> 23:13.761
- OH.

23:13.900 --> 23:17.108
THAT'S FANTASTIC.

23:19.120 --> 23:22.396
ARE YOU SLEEPING--

23:22.530 --> 23:25.158
DATING EACH OTHER?

23:29.060 --> 23:31.221
- I OFFERED
TO PICK UP THE TAB, JULIA.

23:31.370 --> 23:34.339
I-I HAD NO IDEA
IT WAS GONNA BE THAT MUCH MONEY.

23:34.480 --> 23:36.232
I'M--THAT'S ALL THAT HAPPENED.

23:36.380 --> 23:37.608
- OKAY.

23:37.760 --> 23:39.136
- OKAY.
- I DIDN'T HAVE SEX WITH HER.

23:39.270 --> 23:41.477
I DIDN'T KISS HER.

23:41.620 --> 23:43.724
I DIDN'T GO OVER
TO HER HOUSE WITH OUR CHILDREN

23:43.870 --> 23:45.132
AND COOK DINNER WITH HER.
- OKAY.

23:45.280 --> 23:45.939
- I DIDN'T HAVE LONG,
INTIMATE TEXTS WITH HER.

23:46.070 --> 23:48.630
- JOEL.
I HAVE APOLOGIZED.

23:48.770 --> 23:49.998
I MADE A MISTAKE.

23:50.150 --> 23:51.970
I HAVE BEGGED
FOR YOUR FORGIVENESS.

23:52.120 --> 23:53.599
BUT RIGHT NOW,
I'M JUST TRYING

23:53.740 --> 23:56.254
TO UNDERSTAND
WHERE WE ARE IN THIS,

23:56.400 --> 23:59.119
AND I FEEL LIKE I HAVE NOT
BEEN ABLE TO TALK TO YOU--

23:59.260 --> 24:00.420
LIKE IT'S NOT
ALLOWED OR SOMETHING--

24:00.570 --> 24:05.394
AND I DON'T
WANNA LIVE IN LIMBO.

24:05.540 --> 24:08.407
YOU KNOW, SO ARE...

24:08.550 --> 24:09.881
WE TRYING TO GET BACK TOGETHER?

24:10.030 --> 24:13.261
OR ARE WE TRYING
TO DATE OTHER PEOPLE, YOU KNOW?

24:13.410 --> 24:16.379
IT'S JUST
NOT FAIR NOT KNOWING.

24:16.520 --> 24:18.442
- YEAH.

24:18.590 --> 24:20.694
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT--IT'S NOT FAIR.

24:20.830 --> 24:22.070
BUT I STAYED HOME
RAISING OUR FAMILY

24:22.210 --> 24:25.031
AND SUPPORTING YOUR CAREER
FOR ALL THOSE YEARS,

24:25.180 --> 24:28.946
AND WHEN IT WAS YOUR TURN,
YOU COULDN'T DO THAT FOR ME.

24:29.080 --> 24:29.762
THAT'S UNFAIR.

24:29.910 --> 24:31.138
YOU COME INTO MY WORK,

24:31.290 --> 24:33.042
AND YOU MAKE A SCENE
IN FRONT OF MY BOSS.

24:33.190 --> 24:34.873
YOU HAVE AN AFFAIR WITH ED.
THAT'S WHEN--

24:35.020 --> 24:36.157
- I DIDN'T HAVE
AN AFFAIR WITH ED.

24:36.300 --> 24:37.847
- WHATEVER IT IS--
I JUST--I BELIEVED

24:37.990 --> 24:39.878
THAT OUR RELATIONSHIP
WAS BUILT ON MUTUAL RESPECT,

24:40.030 --> 24:44.262
AND I JUST FOUND OUT THAT
THAT--THAT'S NOT THE CASE.

24:44.410 --> 24:46.059
- JOEL, I--

24:46.200 --> 24:49.829
I RESPECT YOU MORE
THAN ANYONE I'VE EVER KNOWN.

24:56.800 --> 24:58.768
LISTEN, I KNOW THAT...

24:58.910 --> 25:00.525
YOUR DAD
WAS UNFAITHFUL TO YOUR MOM,

25:00.670 --> 25:01.898
AND TO THINK ABOUT--

25:02.050 --> 25:03.699
- CAN WE JUST TALK
ABOUT US RIGHT NOW?

25:03.840 --> 25:05.592
I MEAN, MY PARENTS
HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS.

25:05.740 --> 25:06.809
- FINE.
- OKAY.

25:06.950 --> 25:07.974
- OKAY.
I JUST HATE THIS.

25:08.120 --> 25:09.496
- YOU THINK
I DON'T HATE THIS?

25:09.640 --> 25:11.676
YOU THINK I DON'T HATE
LIVING IN THIS CRAPPY APARTMENT,

25:11.820 --> 25:12.946
TRYING TO MAKE IT GREAT
FOR THE KIDS?

25:13.090 --> 25:14.330
YOU THINK I DON'T HATE
THAT THEY SLEEP

25:14.470 --> 25:16.859
IN OUR HOUSE EVERY NIGHT,
AND I SLEEP ALONE HERE?

25:16.990 --> 25:17.809
I HATE IT,
BUT OUR MARRIAGE,

25:17.960 --> 25:19.336
IT WASN'T WORKING, JULIA.

25:19.480 --> 25:21.368
IT WASN'T WORKING FOR ME,

25:21.520 --> 25:24.091
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WANT.

25:24.240 --> 25:25.377
BUT IF YOU HAVE TO KNOW,

25:25.520 --> 25:26.305
IF YOU'RE GONNA
PRESS THE ISSUE RIGHT NOW,

25:26.450 --> 25:29.658
THEN MY--MY ANSWER IS NO.

25:29.800 --> 25:31.142
WE'RE NOT WORKING
ON OUR RELATIONSHIP RIGHT NOW.

25:31.280 --> 25:36.286
WE'RE NOT TRYING
TO GET BACK TOGETHER RIGHT NOW.

25:36.430 --> 25:37.249
I'M SORRY.
[sighs]

[somber pop music]

25:48.330 --> 25:50.673
- WHOA, LOOK AT THIS JOINT.

25:50.820 --> 25:54.199

AND MUSCLE CARS.

25:54.340 --> 25:55.568
WHOA, HO, HO, HO!

25:55.720 --> 25:57.403
DAD, LOOK AT THIS BIKE.

26:01.110 --> 26:03.340
COME ON.
- WOW, THAT'S GORGEOUS.

26:03.490 --> 26:05.276
IT'S ALL HAND-BUILT.

26:05.420 --> 26:06.864
HUH.

26:07.010 --> 26:08.409
- YOU GOTTA RING THE BELL,
I THINK, DAD.

26:08.560 --> 26:10.801
- RIGHT.

26:10.940 --> 26:12.908
- YEAH, CAN I HELP YOU?
- HUH?

26:13.050 --> 26:14.870
HEY.
HI, ARE YOU PAULIE?

26:15.020 --> 26:16.772

26:16.920 --> 26:18.672
OH, HI.
WELL, I'M ZEEK BRAVERMAN,

26:18.810 --> 26:20.846
AND I TALKED
TO PAULIE, AND--

26:20.990 --> 26:24.505
ABOUT A GRILL
FOR A 1965 GTO.

26:24.650 --> 26:26.026
- A GRILL FOR A GTO?

26:26.170 --> 26:27.330
'65, YOU SAY?

26:27.480 --> 26:29.436
OH, YEAH, I'VE GOT SOMEBODY
ELSE INTERESTED IN THAT.

26:29.580 --> 26:30.820
I'M SORRY.
- OH, NO, NO, NO.

26:30.960 --> 26:32.166
NO, IT CAN'T BE.
I MEAN, IT'S TOO LATE.

26:32.310 --> 26:33.857
I MEAN,
BECAUSE I DROVE UP HERE

26:34.000 --> 26:36.230
FROM BERKELEY, CALIFORNIA
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,

26:36.380 --> 26:38.132
PAULIE AND I HAD AGREED
ON A PRICE AND TALKED ABOUT IT--

26:38.280 --> 26:40.009
- WELL, THIS IS NOT
PAULIE'S PLACE!

26:40.150 --> 26:42.004
DO YOU SEE
PAULIE'S NAME ANYWHERE UP THERE?

26:42.150 --> 26:44.289
NO, IT SAYS,
"ERNIE'S SALVAGE YARD."

26:44.430 --> 26:45.556
- OKAY, WE'RE GETTING OFF
TO A BAD START.

26:45.700 --> 26:48.009
- MAYBE WE COULD
JUST LOOK AT THE GRILL.

26:48.150 --> 26:49.185
YOU MIGHT NOT
EVEN WANT IT.

26:49.330 --> 26:50.706
COULD WE--
WOULD YOU SHOW IT TO US?

26:50.850 --> 26:52.294
WILL YOU BE WILLING
TO DO THAT BEFORE WE--

26:52.430 --> 26:57.151
- ALL RIGHT.
GTO 1965 GRILL, MINT CONDITION.

26:57.300 --> 26:59.120
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT: YOU AIN'T
GONNA FIND THIS ANYWHERE.

26:59.270 --> 27:01.090
- OH, MAN.
I SEE IT, I SEE IT.

27:01.240 --> 27:02.195
- THAT'S NICE.

THIS IS IT, YEAH!

27:04.410 --> 27:06.446
OKAY, LISTEN.
I GOT 450 RIGHT HERE.

27:06.590 --> 27:08.546
THAT WAS THE PRICE
PAULIE AND I AGREED ON, 50--

27:08.690 --> 27:10.612
- [laugh
450? S]

27:10.760 --> 27:12.933
- YEAH.
THAT'S THE DEAL.

27:13.070 --> 27:14.867
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

27:15.010 --> 27:16.693
LOOK, I CAN'T GO 450 ON THIS.

27:16.840 --> 27:20.389
THI--WHAT,
THIS IS A 1965

27:20.530 --> 27:23.215
MINT CONDITION GTO GRILL.

27:23.360 --> 27:25.351
NOW WHERE YOU GONNA
FIND SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

27:25.500 --> 27:28.606
- HERE.
HERE IS WHERE I'M GONNA FIND IT.

27:28.750 --> 27:29.569
THAT'S WHAT
PAULIE AND I AGREED ON.

27:29.710 --> 27:32.190
THAT'S WHY
I DROVE 500 MILES

27:32.340 --> 27:34.149
TO GET HERE,
THI--RIGHT HERE.

27:34.300 --> 27:36.268
THIS IS WHERE I'M GONNA DO IT.
- LOOK HERE.

27:36.410 --> 27:38.549
I-I CANNOT
LET THIS GO FOR $450.

27:38.690 --> 27:41.898
- YEAH, WE HAD A DEAL!
- WELL, I DON'T HAVE A DEAL!

27:42.030 --> 27:43.850
- PAULIE AND I HAD A DEAL.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.581
- WELL, YOU FORGET PAULIE!

27:45.730 --> 27:47.698
PAULIE IS NOT HERE!

27:47.830 --> 27:49.627
NOW--
- HOW CONVENIENT.

27:49.770 --> 27:51.283

THAT'S INTERESTED IN THIS

27:51.420 --> 27:54.662
IS WILLING TO GO 800.

27:54.810 --> 27:57.040
I-I CAN'T LET IT GO
FOR LESS THAN 700.

27:57.190 --> 27:58.350
- OKAY, LET ME
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

27:58.500 --> 27:59.944
[overlapping shouting]

28:00.090 --> 28:01.182
YOU KNOW WHAT
THIS IS SOUNDING LIKE TO ME?

28:01.330 --> 28:03.491
THIS IS A SCAM.
THAT'S WHAT THIS IS.

28:03.640 --> 28:04.811
IT'S A SCAM OPERATION.

28:04.950 --> 28:07.191
YOU AND YOUR INVISIBLE
FRIEND PAULIE--

28:07.340 --> 28:09.296
- I THINK YOU GENTLEMEN
BETTER GET OFF MY PROPERTY.

28:09.440 --> 28:10.884
- OKAY,
YOU CAN PUT THAT DOWN.

28:11.030 --> 28:12.099
DAD, LET'S--
- WELL, THAT'S A LITTLE HASTY.

28:12.240 --> 28:15.539
- WE NEED TO REGROUP.
- I'VE GOT 450 BUCKS RIGHT HERE.

28:15.690 --> 28:17.305
DO YOU WANT IT?
- I DON'T WANT YOUR BUSINESS.

28:17.450 --> 28:19.099
NO, GET ON OUTTA HERE.
- YOU DON'T WANT MY BUSINESS?

28:19.240 --> 28:20.241
- HE'S GOT A WEAPON.
HE'S GOT A WEAPON.

28:20.380 --> 28:22.200

YOU SUCK.

28:22.350 --> 28:24.147
- YOU GET
THE HELL OFF MY PROPERTY!

28:24.280 --> 28:25.349
- WHAT DO YOU THINK I'M DOIN'?
I'M GOIN'!

28:25.490 --> 28:26.479
- GO!
- DAMN.

28:26.630 --> 28:29.349
- I'M GONNA WRITE
A BAD REVIEW ON YELP ABOUT THIS.

28:31.950 --> 28:33.975
- I THOUGHT
I WAS DONE WITH HER,

28:34.120 --> 28:38.124
AND I GUESS I'M NOT.

28:38.260 --> 28:40.637
IT'S JUST
THAT WE WERE GETTIN'...

28:40.780 --> 28:42.600
WE WERE GETTIN' ALONG,
YOU KNOW?

28:42.750 --> 28:47.403
WE WERE GETTIN' CLOSER,
AND--AND THEN I THOUGHT--

28:47.550 --> 28:49.893
I WAS STARTING TO BELIEVE
THAT MAYBE THERE WAS A CHANCE.

28:52.900 --> 28:53.924
I DON'T KNOW.

29:03.810 --> 29:05.949
DOC, COME ON.
I'M NOT GONNA CRY.

29:08.980 --> 29:10.117
- HANK.

29:10.260 --> 29:14.082
MY STRONG SUGGESTION
IS THAT YOU

29:14.230 --> 29:16.778
START TO OPEN YOURSELF UP
TO OTHER POSSIBILITIES

29:16.920 --> 29:18.740
BEYOND SARAH.

29:18.890 --> 29:22.303
- YEAH.

29:22.450 --> 29:23.542
YEAH.

29:25.310 --> 29:27.278
IT'S JUST EASIER
SAID THAN DONE.

29:34.770 --> 29:37.079
I'M BLOWING MY NOSE.

29:40.810 --> 29:42.038
- HM, BLEH.

29:42.190 --> 29:42.872
HM.

29:43.020 --> 29:45.466
OKAY, JUST FOR THE RECORD,

29:45.610 --> 29:47.919
THESE ARE NOT
THE WORLD'S BEST WAFFLES.

29:48.060 --> 29:51.086
- YOU PROBABLY DON'T
HAVE ENOUGH BUTTER ON 'EM.

29:51.230 --> 29:53.926
DAD, WE'RE GONNA GET YOU
ANOTHER GRILL FOR THE GTO.

29:54.060 --> 29:55.436
WE'LL GO ONLINE
AND LOOK IT UP.

29:55.580 --> 29:57.093
WE'LL GOOGLE IT,
AND I'LL FIND IT FOR YOU.

29:57.240 --> 29:58.992
IT'S NOT THE END OF THE WORLD.
- IT'S NOT ABOUT THE GTO.

29:59.140 --> 30:01.893
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE GRILL.
- WHAT'S IT ABOUT?

30:12.290 --> 30:14.258
- OH...[sighs]
- WHAT IS IT?

30:20.260 --> 30:23.980
- I'M FEELING OLD, CROSBY.

30:24.130 --> 30:25.950
- DAD, YOU ARE NOT OLD...

30:26.100 --> 30:28.546

YOU KNOW, I JUST, UH...

30:32.790 --> 30:37.375
THIS THING IS HAPPENING
WAY TOO FAST FOR ME.

30:37.520 --> 30:42.310
THE IDEA
OF SELLING THE HOUSE...

30:42.460 --> 30:45.668
YOU KNOW, IT JUST FEELS
LIKE I'M CASHING IT IN.

30:45.800 --> 30:46.732
I'M CASHING IN THE CHECKS.

30:46.870 --> 30:48.872
IT FEELS LIKE THE END.

30:54.230 --> 30:55.948
- HAVE YOU TOLD MOM THAT?

30:56.090 --> 30:59.218
- I TOLD HER I'D SELL IT,
YOU KNOW?

30:59.370 --> 31:01.122
AND I'M NOT GONNA
BE ON WELFARE

31:01.270 --> 31:02.749

31:10.350 --> 31:11.510
I TOLD HER I'D SELL IT,

31:11.660 --> 31:13.139
AND IF I TURNED
AROUND ON THAT NOW,

31:13.280 --> 31:15.032
I MEAN, WHAT KIND OF A MAN
DOES THAT MAKE ME?

31:21.390 --> 31:24.359
WHAT DO YOU THINK
I SHOULD DO, CROSBY?

31:28.780 --> 31:31.010
- [sighs]

31:31.160 --> 31:32.639
MY FATHER
WAS QUOTED A PRICE,

31:32.780 --> 31:35.192
AND YOU'RE GONNA HONOR
THAT PRICE, NOT A PENNY MORE.

31:35.340 --> 31:36.409
- I TOLD YOU GENTLEMEN

31:36.540 --> 31:38.337
I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN DOING BUSINESS.

31:38.480 --> 31:40.027

MAKE THIS WORTH YOUR WHILE.

32:22.520 --> 32:24.272
AM I LATE?
- NO, I--I--

32:24.420 --> 32:25.580
I WAS EVEN A LITTLE LATE.

32:25.730 --> 32:27.766
- OH.

32:27.910 --> 32:29.002
BUT I WAS PROUD OF MYSELF.

"INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL."

32:50.450 --> 32:51.405
I GOT OUT
OF MY PARENT'S HOUSE,

OH, WELL!

34:13.320 --> 34:14.764
YOU MUST BE VERY PROUD.

34:14.910 --> 34:16.184

34:16.330 --> 34:18.969
I CAN'T WAIT TO READ IT.
- YEAH.

34:19.120 --> 34:20.041
AND THE OTHER THING

34:20.190 --> 34:24.081
THAT'S SORT OF

34:24.230 --> 34:29.122

34:45.630 --> 34:48.497

34:51.460 --> 34:52.495
WE WANTED THE SAME THINGS.

34:52.640 --> 34:54.733

35:08.960 --> 35:12.896
YOU WOULD RUN INTO SOMEONE
AND THEY MIGHT TELL YOU,

35:13.040 --> 35:15.201
AND I DIDN'T
WANT YOU TO JUST,

35:15.350 --> 35:17.386

ALL RIGHT, THIS LOOKS GOOD.

35:53.320 --> 35:54.548
AND...

35:54.700 --> 35:57.419

36:52.240 --> 36:53.309
[knock at door]

36:53.450 --> 36:55.099
YOU KNOW,
ONE OF MY BIGGEST FAULTS

36:55.240 --> 36:57.754
IS THAT I'M TOO STRAIGHT AND
I HAVE TOO MUCH SAY AS IT IS.

36:57.900 --> 37:00.061
- WELL, DO IT FOR
THE 100TH BIRTHDAY PARTY

37:00.210 --> 37:01.108

37:15.330 --> 37:16.740

37:16.880 --> 37:19.155
HOW DOES THIS GO?

37:19.300 --> 37:21.530

37:21.680 --> 37:22.601

37:22.750 --> 37:24.433

37:24.580 --> 37:26.024
- YEAH, NO, NO.
WE'RE GONNA GO SKATING.

37:26.170 --> 37:27.307
IT'S GONNA BE FUN.
- YOU DIDN'T EVEN TELL US

37:27.450 --> 37:28.849
WHERE WE WERE GOING.
THAT'S RUDE.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.480

LOOKS REALLY CRAPPY.

37:31.620 --> 37:33.030
- OKAY, I--

37:33.180 --> 37:34.693
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

37:34.830 --> 37:35.933
WE USED TO COME HERE
A LOT WHEN WE WERE LITTLE.

37:36.080 --> 37:37.695
IT'S ACTUALLY REALLY FUN
ONCE YOU GET OUT THERE.

37:37.840 --> 37:40.559
- IT LOOKS LIKE
IT GOT PRETTY OLD SINCE THEN.

37:40.700 --> 37:42.429
- OKAY, IT'S RUN-DOWN.

37:42.570 --> 37:44.185
- IT'S A '7OS-STYLE DECOR,
THAT'S TRUE.

37:44.330 --> 37:46.423
BUT ONCE WE'RE OUT THERE, IT'S
ACTUALLY GONNA BE REALLY FUN.

37:46.570 --> 37:48.083
- I'M NOT SKATING.
- ME NEITHER.

37:48.230 --> 37:50.391
- YOU CAN'T FORCE ME.

37:50.540 --> 37:51.507
- SO WHAT DO WE DO?
- OKAY.

37:51.640 --> 37:53.505
CAN I TALK
TO YOU GUYS FOR A SEC?

37:53.650 --> 37:56.574
CAN YOU SIT DOWN
JUST FOR A SECOND, PLEASE?

38:03.350 --> 38:05.375
YOU GUYS...

38:05.520 --> 38:06.657

YOU'RE GOING THROUGH

38:06.800 --> 38:09.519
IS, LIKE, REALLY, REALLY HARD.

38:09.660 --> 38:10.968
AND I'M NOT JUST
SAYING THAT, YOU KNOW?

38:11.110 --> 38:13.795
I'M SAYING IT
'CAUSE I WENT THROUGH IT TOO.

38:13.940 --> 38:15.623
AND THERE'S
NOT A WHOLE LOT

38:15.770 --> 38:17.567
THAT I CAN SAY OR DO
THAT'S GONNA MAKE IT BETTER.

38:17.700 --> 38:20.772
BUT I CAN TELL YOU
THAT AT LEAST

38:20.910 --> 38:22.639
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO
THROUGH IT ALONE, YOU KNOW?

38:22.780 --> 38:24.634
'CAUSE YOU GUYS

38:24.780 --> 38:27.578
JUST LIKE I HAD HIM.

38:27.710 --> 38:31.669
I PROMISE YOU
IT MAKES IT A LOT EASIER.

38:31.820 --> 38:33.549
SO JUST DON'T
GIVE UP YET, OKAY?

38:33.690 --> 38:35.373
WE CAN STILL
HAVE SOME FUN.

38:35.520 --> 38:36.896
GIVE IT A TRY, HUH?

38:37.030 --> 38:38.406
GIVE IT A SHOT.

38:38.550 --> 38:39.687
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
FIVE MINUTES.

38:39.830 --> 38:41.104
IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT,
WE CAN LEAVE.

38:41.240 --> 38:42.241
- FINE.
- YEAH!

38:42.380 --> 38:45.349
ALL RIGHT!
LET'S STRAP UP.

38:45.490 --> 38:47.526
HUH?

OF MY HOMEWORK.

38:56.810 --> 38:59.677
- OKAY.
- MOM, YOU SHOULD COME WITH US.

38:59.820 --> 39:00.559
- OH, HONEY,
I AM NOT A BEACH PERSON.

39:00.710 --> 39:02.746
I'M FROM CLEVELAND, REMEMBER?

39:02.890 --> 39:03.709
- HE'D LOVE FOR YOU TO COME.
TELL YOU WHAT.

39:03.850 --> 39:05.021
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST LEAVE THAT,

39:05.170 --> 39:07.309
AND WE'LL GRAB
SOME PIZZAS ON THE WAY BACK?

39:07.440 --> 39:09.613
- PLEASE.
I WANT YOU TO COME.

39:12.350 --> 39:13.612
- OKAY.
I CAN'T SAY "NO" TO THAT.

39:13.760 --> 39:14.988
- OKAY.

39:15.140 --> 39:16.584
- HERE, LOOK,
YOU CAN TAKE PICTURES OF ME

39:16.730 --> 39:18.038
WHEN WE'RE THERE.
YOU OPEN IT UP LIKE THIS,

39:18.180 --> 39:19.204
AND THEN YOU WIND
THIS FORWARD TWICE

39:19.350 --> 39:20.794
AND THEN BACK ONCE.

39:20.940 --> 39:25.115
THEN YOU CLOSE IT,
AND THIS CONTROLS THE SHUTTER.

39:25.250 --> 39:27.457
