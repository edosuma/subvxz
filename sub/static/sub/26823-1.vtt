01:50.007 --> 01:52.975
- Thank you.
- Does your mom have a favorite flower?

01:52.977 --> 01:55.747
Ah, she loves those red
Gerbera flowers.

02:00.018 --> 02:02.351
Do you have a favorite flower?

02:02.353 --> 02:03.722
I don't know.

02:04.890 --> 02:06.922
Well, when you dated
people in the past

02:06.924 --> 02:08.627
what kind of flower..?

02:09.259 --> 02:11.161
what kind of flower
did they give you?

02:11.163 --> 02:14.066
I think I've given more
flowers than I've received.

02:15.366 --> 02:16.799
What?

02:16.801 --> 02:18.133
- Really?
- Yes.

02:18.135 --> 02:19.103
- No.
- Yes.

02:20.038 --> 02:22.942
You have to let me be the
one to give you flowers.

02:31.149 --> 02:35.385
<i>I don't understand
people. Who steals a doormat?</i>

02:35.387 --> 02:37.053
How're you doin'?

02:37.055 --> 02:40.322
Oh, I'm missing doormats
and losing my mind.

02:40.324 --> 02:41.824
You know what I'm saying.

02:41.826 --> 02:43.125
This is your first Thanksgiving

02:43.127 --> 02:44.860
without your dad.

02:44.862 --> 02:47.229
- Hi.
- Hey.

02:47.231 --> 02:49.798
Why, why are
you huddled outside my door?

02:49.800 --> 02:52.067
Will you come in to the office
to pay, sweetie?

02:52.069 --> 02:55.071
I'm waiting for my daughter to
come and bring me the cash.

02:55.073 --> 02:58.173
- I'll bring it tomorrow.
- Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.

02:58.175 --> 02:59.441
She's...

02:59.443 --> 03:02.811
Excuse me. Can I help you?

03:02.813 --> 03:06.281
- I don't know. Who are you?
- Rose.

03:06.283 --> 03:07.784
This is my hotel.

03:07.786 --> 03:08.987
Oh!

03:09.820 --> 03:12.088
Yeah, I'm just lost.

03:12.090 --> 03:15.024
- Okay.
- Thought it was a diner but...

03:15.026 --> 03:17.229
Yeah, all good. Thanks.

03:18.229 --> 03:20.098
- Bye.
- Bye.

03:24.802 --> 03:26.237
What the hell was that?

03:27.038 --> 03:28.537
I've seen that van before.

03:28.539 --> 03:30.472
You've gotta tell me this stuff.

03:30.474 --> 03:32.542
- What stuff?
- Suspicious stuff.

03:32.544 --> 03:36.512
Your brother is the most
suspicious thing around here.

03:36.514 --> 03:39.516
- That's true.
- Alright.

03:45.423 --> 03:48.394
- I like you in an apron.
- Don't get used to it.

03:49.127 --> 03:52.495
- So, I've been thinking about something.
- Oh, yeah, what?

03:52.497 --> 03:57.800
I think maybe you and
I should go on a trip.

03:57.802 --> 03:59.170
Oh, yeah? Where do you wanna go?

04:00.038 --> 04:01.870
I don't know.
Maybe somewhere for New...

04:01.872 --> 04:05.208
Ahem, Ladies, are we
interrupting something?

04:05.210 --> 04:06.542
This is Mimi.

04:06.544 --> 04:08.011
Hi.

04:08.013 --> 04:09.546
Mimi, this is
my roommate Lauren,

04:09.548 --> 04:10.479
and Hailey.

04:10.481 --> 04:12.248
I have to pee.

04:12.250 --> 04:15.187
I'm sorry.
The bathroom is down the hall.

04:21.225 --> 04:23.425
Somethin' smells good.
What are we cookin'?

04:23.427 --> 04:25.161
Berry crumble for tomorrow.

04:25.163 --> 04:27.096
What are your Thanksgiving
plans? What are you doing?

04:27.098 --> 04:29.031
Mimi invited me to
a pot luck in Brooklyn

04:29.033 --> 04:30.899
with some friends,
so I don't know.

04:30.901 --> 04:32.435
- I'm Weighing my options.
- Oh.

04:32.437 --> 04:33.806
Yeah.

04:35.072 --> 04:36.906
- Wait, no, no, stop.
- Ooh!

04:36.908 --> 04:38.041
- Hey, Mrs. Anderson!
- No, no.

04:38.043 --> 04:39.341
Not, not funny,

04:39.343 --> 04:41.176
Austin, seriously?
Give me the phone.

04:41.178 --> 04:43.214
- Oh, why thank you.
- Give me the phone.

04:44.182 --> 04:48.287
Hi, mom.
Yeah, I'll call you back.

04:49.086 --> 04:50.320
Bye, Mrs. Anderson.

04:50.322 --> 04:53.192
- Austin!
- Yeah. Watch out.

04:54.291 --> 04:57.093
Hey. It's nice
to see you too, Hailey.

04:57.095 --> 04:58.998
Always a pleasure, Austin.

05:01.199 --> 05:02.598
I'm gonna check the crumble.

05:07.471 --> 05:09.375
What the hell?

05:10.274 --> 05:11.911
Oh.

05:14.178 --> 05:16.478
Looking for a diner, my ass.

05:16.480 --> 05:17.949
I'm home!

05:21.485 --> 05:22.954
My brother,

05:23.622 --> 05:25.288
is up to something.

05:25.290 --> 05:27.356
- Well, you gotta fire him.
- I can't fire my brother.

05:27.358 --> 05:29.192
Work's supposed
to keep him out of trouble.

05:29.194 --> 05:31.159
Are you eating blueberry pie?

05:31.161 --> 05:34.029
First of all, it's only
147 calories per slice.

05:34.031 --> 05:35.998
- Yeah.
- Second of all,

05:36.000 --> 05:39.135
- it's a super-food.
- And you're a super-man,

05:39.137 --> 05:40.570
but it's for tomorrow.

05:40.572 --> 05:41.841
Not this slice.

05:42.841 --> 05:45.844
Okay. Did you watch
the turkey carving video?

05:46.411 --> 05:47.846
Well, I did and I didn't.

05:49.380 --> 05:52.414
- Dad always carved the turkey.
- Oh, come here.

05:52.416 --> 05:55.050
I know.
I'll watch the video, I promise.

05:55.052 --> 05:56.519
I miss him too.

05:56.521 --> 05:58.288
And he's the only one
that would fight me for

05:58.290 --> 06:00.589
- the dark meat.
- Oh, please watch the video.

06:00.591 --> 06:03.125
I will, I swear. I mean,
how else am I gonna know how

06:03.127 --> 06:04.993
carve a dumb turkey?

06:04.995 --> 06:06.495
Yeah. I still love you, though.

06:06.497 --> 06:07.630
Yeah, I love you too.

06:11.136 --> 06:13.105
What are we supposed
to do with that?

06:17.242 --> 06:21.644
- Mm-mm.
- Mm-mm.

06:21.646 --> 06:23.245
- No.
- Hey, mom.

06:23.247 --> 06:26.149
- <i>You didn't call me back!</i>
- Uh, sorry.

06:26.151 --> 06:29.051
Austin sent
a smoked turkey again.

06:29.053 --> 06:32.187
I'm making my turkey too. How
much turkey does he think we eat?

06:32.189 --> 06:34.457
I have no idea. I mean,
he's not even coming this year.

06:34.459 --> 06:37.192
- What's with the Wi-Fi?
- You know, sweetie, technologically,

06:37.194 --> 06:40.329
that doesn't do anything.
So, did you have a nice night?

06:40.331 --> 06:42.565
Yeah. Just hanging out
with Hailey.

06:42.567 --> 06:45.300
- When are we meeting the boyfriend?
- Soon.

06:45.302 --> 06:47.202
- <i>When's soon?</i>
- Mom.

06:47.204 --> 06:49.038
When are you and
your friend coming tomorrow?

06:49.040 --> 06:51.541
I need a game plan.
I don't like surprises.

06:51.543 --> 06:54.310
I'm coming at, like, 10:00.
She's coming a little later.

06:54.312 --> 06:57.046
Okay, okay, I love you.
Bye. Muah!

06:57.048 --> 06:59.184
I love you, too. Bye. Muah!

07:02.052 --> 07:04.320
She doesn't like surprises.

07:04.322 --> 07:06.992
- Surprise, I'm not a boyfriend.
- Right.

07:07.625 --> 07:09.024
What should I wear tomorrow?

07:09.026 --> 07:10.093
Um, I don't know,

07:10.095 --> 07:12.594
just, casual, comfortable.

07:12.596 --> 07:14.197
My family's super comfortable.

07:14.199 --> 07:16.231
- Pajamas?
- Funny.

07:16.233 --> 07:17.733
What are you gonna say to them?

07:17.735 --> 07:20.135
Mom, dad, I have a girlfriend.

07:20.137 --> 07:22.238
She'll be here, like, real soon.

07:22.240 --> 07:24.207
Are you sure you don't
want me to come with you?

07:24.209 --> 07:27.110
Yeah. I don't wanna
bombard them.

08:17.095 --> 08:18.260
Did you watch
the video yet?

08:18.262 --> 08:19.530
I'm on it.

08:21.098 --> 08:23.265
- I want grandchildren.
- Okay.

08:23.267 --> 08:25.834
I don't wanna be 80,
chasing around a 5-year-old.

08:25.836 --> 08:27.469
- No.
- I'm still vivacious.

08:27.471 --> 08:28.439
Yes, you are.

08:29.440 --> 08:32.043
- How did we get old?
- Nobody's old. Who's old?

08:32.777 --> 08:35.578
Just yesterday I was getting high
and listening to The Beatles.

08:35.580 --> 08:39.081
Well, yeah, that's what you do...
Lauren's walking?

08:39.082 --> 08:40.816
Why would she walk?

08:40.818 --> 08:43.352
- I have no idea.
- Who walks?

08:51.729 --> 08:54.430
- What are you doing?
- Why didn't you call for a ride?

08:54.432 --> 08:56.531
Sorry, I just wanted to walk,
clear my head.

08:56.533 --> 08:58.334
Just doing
my beads, chanting.

08:58.336 --> 09:00.869
Alright. Well,
let me hug my favorite daughter.

09:00.871 --> 09:02.537
- Only daughter.
- Oh, heads up.

09:02.539 --> 09:04.739
Your mom was just talking
about grandchildren.

09:04.741 --> 09:06.508
- What grandchildren?
- Exactly.

09:06.510 --> 09:08.777
- What are you chanting?
- Hare Krishna.

09:08.779 --> 09:12.547
If I see you with a tambourine
begging for money, I swear to God...

09:12.549 --> 09:14.249
Mom.

09:14.251 --> 09:16.319
Oh, God, do you think we could
hide this today?

09:16.321 --> 09:17.853
<i>What? Why?</i>

09:17.855 --> 09:21.123
Um, mom, I'm in a relationship.

09:21.125 --> 09:24.392
Right, that mystery man you're
embarrassed to bring home.

09:24.394 --> 09:25.661
- Yeah.
- Help me with the carrots.

09:25.663 --> 09:27.229
Before we get going with
the carrots,

09:27.231 --> 09:28.564
I wanted to talk to you about...

09:28.566 --> 09:30.299
Yes, tell me, tell me.
I keep asking.

09:30.301 --> 09:31.566
Well, I wanted to make sure

09:31.568 --> 09:34.170
- if it was serious.
- And?

09:34.172 --> 09:36.204
- It's, you know...
- What are you doing?

09:36.206 --> 09:38.206
- Just checking.
- You see what he's doing?

09:38.208 --> 09:40.175
He's checking his stash.

09:40.177 --> 09:41.743
- Stash?
- Of cookies. He wants to see

09:41.745 --> 09:43.146
how many I've eaten.

09:43.148 --> 09:44.680
- What?
- I found the most amazing

09:44.682 --> 09:47.617
almond cookie. Unfortunately,
she also loves 'em.

09:47.619 --> 09:51.454
- The woman can whack a box in a day.
- Excuse you, I do not.

09:51.456 --> 09:53.522
- So...
- Peel. Talk and peel.

09:53.524 --> 09:55.624
You know, it's important
for you guys to know

09:55.626 --> 09:57.359
that, like, having
feelings for someone,

09:57.361 --> 09:59.262
it can take you
by surprise. I mean,

09:59.264 --> 10:02.632
that you might not expect. I
mean, it took me by surprise.

10:02.634 --> 10:03.766
- Right?
- Um,

10:03.768 --> 10:05.368
and so I was thinking that,

10:05.370 --> 10:07.502
- what the...?
- Who the hell could that be?

10:07.504 --> 10:09.671
If your parents
are four hours early

10:09.673 --> 10:11.806
I will literally scream.

10:11.808 --> 10:12.908
Can you get that?

10:12.910 --> 10:16.244
- I...
- Can you... Oh!

10:16.246 --> 10:19.117
- They did this before.
- When?

10:19.750 --> 10:22.353
365 days ago.

10:24.489 --> 10:26.388
- What are you doing?!
- Just stretching it out.

10:26.390 --> 10:28.657
Last night was a feat of
physical dexterity,

10:28.659 --> 10:30.926
- with Mimi.
- No, what are you doing here?

10:30.928 --> 10:32.695
- You can't be here.
- Yeah, your mom invited me.

10:32.697 --> 10:34.530
- When?
- Last night, on the phone.

10:34.532 --> 10:36.464
She said if my plans
fell through I was more

10:36.466 --> 10:38.267
- than welcome to join you guys.
- Oh, you're not.

10:38.269 --> 10:39.901
- What happened to pot luck?
- I don't want Mimi thinking

10:39.903 --> 10:42.504
I want anything serious.
Besides, Thanksgiving alone

10:42.506 --> 10:44.272
would be so depressing,
and your family loves me.

10:44.274 --> 10:46.541
Austin, I'm trying to come out.

10:46.543 --> 10:48.579
On Thanksgiving?
That's pretty crazy.

10:49.813 --> 10:51.280
- Austin!
- Hey!

10:51.282 --> 10:52.281
I didn't know you were coming!

10:52.283 --> 10:53.281
Surprise!

10:53.283 --> 10:54.416
Oh, this is great!

10:54.418 --> 10:55.486
Did you get the turkey?

10:56.453 --> 10:58.353
No wonder you sent the turkey.

10:58.355 --> 11:01.723
- Okay. I understand.
- Oh, no.

11:01.725 --> 11:03.559
Austin. Come on in.

11:03.561 --> 11:06.929
Make yourself at home.
That turkey was very thoughtful.

11:06.931 --> 11:08.500
See? I'm thoughtful.

11:09.567 --> 11:11.499
- This is so great.
- No, he's not the boyfriend.

11:11.501 --> 11:13.969
- How did this happen?
- No, no, what?

11:13.971 --> 11:15.671
Honey, this is great.
I love him.

11:15.673 --> 11:16.839
Mom, no. No, no.

11:16.841 --> 11:18.541
Isn't there a song, like,

11:18.543 --> 11:20.675
"Are you my best
friend, are you my lover?"

11:20.677 --> 11:22.578
- I don't know that song.
- Isn't there a song like that?

11:22.580 --> 11:24.313
- No.
- Come, oh, my gosh.

11:24.315 --> 11:25.684
- He's so great.
- He's not my boyfriend.

11:30.421 --> 11:31.657
Hello, Mr. Anderson.

11:34.958 --> 11:37.459
Okay. Lauren, I need your focus.

11:37.461 --> 11:39.829
- Mom, I need your focus.
- Peel.

11:39.831 --> 11:42.430
- Oh, what are you doing?
- Having breakfast.

11:42.432 --> 11:44.333
Pie is not breakfast.

11:44.335 --> 11:46.868
- Blueberries.
- With sugar and butter.

11:46.870 --> 11:48.671
Talk sense into your father.

11:48.673 --> 11:50.772
- Dad, pie's not breakfast.
- So good.

11:50.774 --> 11:52.708
I can't serve that now.

11:52.710 --> 11:54.810
- Are you eating meat these days?
- No, mom.

11:54.812 --> 11:57.012
I was really hoping
that was a phase.

11:57.014 --> 11:58.948
What are you doing?

11:58.950 --> 12:01.383
Guys, I really need to talk
to the two of you alone.

12:01.385 --> 12:04.420
Whatever you have to say, you can say
it in front of Austin. He's family.

12:04.422 --> 12:05.554
- Yeah.
- I mean, is he?

12:05.556 --> 12:06.888
That's a legitimate question.

12:06.890 --> 12:08.556
Oh! Sweetie, you can't just

12:08.558 --> 12:10.528
dump, you need to measure.

12:11.528 --> 12:14.897
Okay, what's on your mind?
Talk, talk, talk.

12:14.899 --> 12:16.799
Last night Hailey and I
went to this LPAC thing.

12:16.801 --> 12:19.602
Yes, saw a picture on Instagram.
I liked it.

12:19.604 --> 12:21.469
Yeah, you are
all over my social media, um.

12:21.471 --> 12:22.938
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Nothing, nothing.

12:22.940 --> 12:25.041
- Um
- I've gotta get a broom.

12:25.043 --> 12:26.908
You went to an alpaca meeting?

12:26.910 --> 12:30.546
LPAC, it's a super PAC for
lesbians, for women in power.

12:30.548 --> 12:33.516
- It's a political power thing.
- Since when are you into politics?

12:33.518 --> 12:36.951
- And lesbians?
- Can we please stay focused? Um.

12:36.953 --> 12:39.488
We went to this LPAC thing
and then we came home

12:39.490 --> 12:41.390
and we made this
berry crumble together.

12:41.392 --> 12:43.592
You have got to take
one of these brooms.

12:43.594 --> 12:46.061
- We just got them at the motel.
- So you're a feminist now.

12:46.063 --> 12:48.497
- They are freakin' great.
- I'm just trying to stay informed.

12:48.499 --> 12:50.833
Oh, Hailey's not informing you?
That's a bummer.

12:50.835 --> 12:53.401
- Feel it, sweetie.
- Yeah, go on.

12:53.403 --> 12:55.938
Feel the broom, feel it.

12:55.940 --> 12:58.074
They gotta feel good.
When they feel good,

12:58.076 --> 13:00.776
they pick up all the stuff on the floor.
You're taking one back.

13:00.778 --> 13:03.079
I just don't understand why
women have to gather, to rally.

13:03.081 --> 13:04.680
- Because you're not a woman.
- Uh-huh.

13:04.682 --> 13:07.416
She can ignore me, you can't.

13:07.418 --> 13:08.850
Yeah, I'll take one.
Got a broom.

13:08.852 --> 13:10.920
It's important
to keep the home clean.

13:10.922 --> 13:13.089
Mom, me and Austin,
we don't have a home.

13:13.091 --> 13:14.489
We don't have a home.

13:14.491 --> 13:15.791
I am not against women.

13:15.793 --> 13:17.926
- Oh, my God!
- So, why are you yelling?

13:17.928 --> 13:20.463
Whatever you have to say,
we support you.

13:20.465 --> 13:21.997
- George, we love Austin, right?
- Do we?

13:21.999 --> 13:24.800
Austin, come with me now!
We're going upstairs!

13:24.802 --> 13:25.836
Okay.

13:28.740 --> 13:31.107
No wonder he sent the turkey.
This is very exciting.

13:31.109 --> 13:34.477
I just wish he would have had
the decency to ask

13:34.479 --> 13:35.810
before moving in together.

13:35.812 --> 13:39.448
They were already living
together, so...

13:39.450 --> 13:41.916
- As roommates, but this.
- They're in love.

13:41.918 --> 13:43.719
Living in sin?

13:43.721 --> 13:46.722
Sweetie, this is the 21st century.
These things just happen.

13:46.724 --> 13:49.824
These things don't just happen
to my daughter.

13:49.826 --> 13:51.761
- Fix this.
- And tell them you're a scissor sister?

13:51.763 --> 13:53.762
- No way.
- No, tell them we're not dating, Austin.

13:53.764 --> 13:56.165
You tell them you're a lesbian.
Two birds, one stone.

13:56.167 --> 13:57.932
This is not funny.

13:57.934 --> 13:59.337
Okay. Come on.

14:02.907 --> 14:03.908
Take a deep breath.

14:05.942 --> 14:06.877
Relax.

14:07.979 --> 14:11.747
You're like a balloon.
Let me be your strength.

14:11.749 --> 14:13.616
Baby girl, I'm having a crisis.

14:13.618 --> 14:16.484
Does this make me look fat?
This says fat, right?

14:16.486 --> 14:19.488
- Don't answer that.
- We're not dating.

14:19.490 --> 14:21.089
Oh, your father's
gonna come around.

14:21.091 --> 14:22.657
No, no seriously
we're not dating,

14:22.659 --> 14:24.627
- Mrs. Anderson.
- I promise you.

14:24.629 --> 14:27.028
- He's not the boyfriend.
- Okay.

14:27.030 --> 14:28.897
- Hey, I'm gonna go to the store.
- Oh, good, wait.

14:28.899 --> 14:30.733
I need walnuts,
Ronnybrook yogurt,

14:30.735 --> 14:32.901
pistachios for your father
and Jarlsberg cheese.

14:32.903 --> 14:35.036
- That's your favorite, right?
- Yeah, text it to me.

14:35.038 --> 14:36.807
- Okay.
- Hands off, you wanna come with?

14:51.489 --> 14:53.656
I have nothing to wear.
Nothing fits.

14:53.658 --> 14:55.523
Your father
keeps bringing home cookies.

14:55.525 --> 14:57.661
- Shirt looks nice.
- Yeah.

14:59.629 --> 15:02.797
I'm sad today without my dad.

15:02.799 --> 15:04.666
I know, mom. I'm sorry.

15:04.668 --> 15:06.634
I miss him too.

15:06.636 --> 15:07.570
I love you, mom.

15:07.572 --> 15:08.907
I love you too.

15:10.073 --> 15:12.874
Okay.

15:12.876 --> 15:14.108
Text the list.

15:14.110 --> 15:15.945
Text the list.

15:15.947 --> 15:18.417
Hey, mom, I really gotta talk
to you about Hailey.

15:20.684 --> 15:22.852
- About Hailey?
- Yeah.

15:22.854 --> 15:25.186
Okay. I understand, though.

15:25.188 --> 15:26.622
What do you understand?

15:26.624 --> 15:27.989
I'm excited to meet your friend,

15:27.991 --> 15:29.791
but I get it's hard

15:29.793 --> 15:32.094
maintaining friendships when
you're in a relationship.

15:32.096 --> 15:34.229
- What are you talking about?
- It's a real best friend

15:34.231 --> 15:36.665
when someone else
takes that place.

15:36.667 --> 15:38.501
You've had a lot
of best friends.

15:38.503 --> 15:41.002
- What?
- I thought we were best friends.

15:41.004 --> 15:43.705
But you don't
tell me anything anymore.

15:43.707 --> 15:47.542
- I tell you things, mom.
- Tell me how to spell Jarlsberg?

15:47.544 --> 15:49.244
It's a J.

15:49.246 --> 15:53.848
J-A-R-L-S... B-U-R-G or B-E-R-G?

15:53.850 --> 15:57.887
- Okay, well, Hailey's at the station now.
- Okay.

15:57.889 --> 16:00.855
- So, I guess I'll just go.
- You want me to come?

16:00.857 --> 16:02.791
No. How do I look?
Do I look okay?

16:02.793 --> 16:05.026
- Good, you look good.
- What does that mean?

16:05.028 --> 16:08.129
For someone who's doing all this meditating
you're awfully stressed, sweetie.

16:08.131 --> 16:11.132
Maybe you're not doing it right.
Maybe, maybe it's reversing

16:11.134 --> 16:13.234
- your brain waves.
- You're making it worse, mom.

16:13.236 --> 16:16.070
Do you want anything while
I'm texting your father?

16:16.072 --> 16:18.741
- No.
- Okay.

16:32.690 --> 16:34.025
Um...

16:35.559 --> 16:36.560
Where's the store?

16:38.195 --> 16:42.164
Well, you know, I just thought I'd get
you away from the hubbub of the house,

16:42.166 --> 16:45.667
- have a little chat man-to-man.
- Okay.

16:45.669 --> 16:47.705
Just had a couple of questions.

16:49.206 --> 16:51.940
How long have
you been dating my daughter?

16:51.942 --> 16:55.777
Oh, yeah, no, no, sir.
We're not dating.

16:55.779 --> 16:57.948
- Don't lie to me.
- Oh, no, I'm not lying.

16:59.149 --> 17:01.717
Okay. Let me rephrase.

17:01.719 --> 17:03.651
How long have you been
sleeping with my daughter?

17:03.653 --> 17:07.790
Oh, what do you mean?

17:09.059 --> 17:10.528
What do I mean?

17:11.194 --> 17:13.063
Okay, what has Lauren told you?

17:15.165 --> 17:16.934
Nothing gets past me.

17:19.069 --> 17:20.538
We're not dating.

17:23.874 --> 17:26.144
You're saying you've never
slept with my daughter?

17:28.778 --> 17:30.048
Is that what you're saying?

17:33.351 --> 17:36.017
Okay, okay. Yeah, um.

17:36.019 --> 17:39.023
Yeah, so we slept
together once and, um...

17:39.890 --> 17:42.658
It never happened again. It was just
one time and it didn't mean anything.

17:42.660 --> 17:45.259
- It didn't mean anything?!
- Well, I didn't mean like that.

17:45.261 --> 17:48.296
- You know, it's just that we...
- You slept with my daughter

17:48.298 --> 17:49.832
and it didn't mean anything!

17:49.834 --> 17:51.400
No, it meant something.

17:51.402 --> 17:52.867
It just, we're not dating.

17:52.869 --> 17:54.135
You better be dating

17:54.137 --> 17:55.703
if you're
sleeping with my daughter!

17:55.705 --> 17:57.942
- But I...
- Take a look around.

18:02.813 --> 18:05.617
- You see anybody?
- No.

18:06.851 --> 18:09.821
- You think you'll be missed?
- What?

18:12.355 --> 18:13.924
Ten.

18:14.892 --> 18:16.725
- Nine.
- Oh, god, are you counting down

18:16.727 --> 18:18.126
- to kill me?
- Eight.

18:18.128 --> 18:19.995
Okay, okay, yep.

18:19.997 --> 18:23.065
- Seven.
- Okay, okay, yeah, yeah, we're dating.

18:23.067 --> 18:24.999
- Six.
- We're dating, we're dating, we're dating.

18:25.001 --> 18:27.102
- I am obsessed with her.
- Five.

18:27.104 --> 18:29.404
- I love her. She is a great human being!
- Four.

18:29.406 --> 18:32.074
- I think you birthed an amazing little girl.
- Three!

18:32.076 --> 18:34.977
- I'm dating your daughter!
- Okay.

18:34.979 --> 18:37.278
Man asks a simple question,

18:37.280 --> 18:39.347
just give a straight answer.

18:47.791 --> 18:50.025
- Hey.
- Hi.

18:50.027 --> 18:51.663
I made it.

18:52.863 --> 18:54.763
Oh, I got this for your mom.

18:54.765 --> 18:56.131
Oh, that was really nice.

18:56.133 --> 19:00.436
- And these.
- That was so thoughtful.

19:00.438 --> 19:03.842
- Everything okay?
- Mm-hm. Yeah.

19:04.974 --> 19:06.909
So, how far is it from here?

19:06.911 --> 19:09.147
Just, it's, uh,
it's really close.

19:11.749 --> 19:12.817
So close.

19:17.488 --> 19:20.322
So, how did it go?

19:20.324 --> 19:21.726
You look really nice.

19:23.193 --> 19:24.325
So, Austin...

19:24.327 --> 19:26.761
I don't wanna talk about Austin.

19:26.763 --> 19:27.930
No, I know. It's just that...

19:27.932 --> 19:29.398
Lauren, today is
about you and me.

19:29.400 --> 19:31.100
And today's totally still about

19:31.102 --> 19:33.201
you and me, but I should
tell you that Austin is...

19:33.203 --> 19:34.239
Right! So no Austin.

19:35.338 --> 19:36.838
Okay, but the thing is...

19:36.840 --> 19:37.972
If you say Austin one more time,

19:37.974 --> 19:39.276
I'm gonna get out of this car.

19:50.221 --> 19:52.888
- Welcome to my home.
- It's so cute.

19:52.890 --> 19:55.524
Yeah. Um, don't look at that.

19:55.526 --> 19:58.994
- Okay, now I have to.
- Come on.

19:58.996 --> 20:02.096
- Oh, God.
- Oh, wow.

20:02.098 --> 20:04.365
- Yes.
- This is amazing.

20:04.367 --> 20:06.134
It's a whole lotta me.

20:06.136 --> 20:09.103
- You must be Hailey.
- Hi, these are for you.

20:09.105 --> 20:11.539
Oh, these are my favorite.
That is so nice.

20:11.541 --> 20:14.409
It is such a pleasure to finally meet you.
We've heard so much about you.

20:14.411 --> 20:18.046
- Oh, thank you so much for having me.
- Oh, you're so welcome.

20:18.048 --> 20:20.149
I was just looking
at this amazing collage.

20:20.151 --> 20:22.284
- Pretty great, right?
- Yes, it is so embarrassing.

20:22.286 --> 20:24.553
- No, it's beautiful.
- She's always beautiful to me.

20:24.555 --> 20:25.957
Okay.

20:28.992 --> 20:29.991
- Hey, Hailey.
- Austin?

20:29.993 --> 20:31.325
I need to talk to you.

20:31.327 --> 20:32.995
- There you go.
- Whoa, are you okay?

20:32.997 --> 20:34.863
Oh, you went
lumberjack chic, too.

20:34.865 --> 20:36.864
That's what I tried to tell you
in the car on the way over here.

20:36.866 --> 20:38.267
I'm really sorry.

20:38.269 --> 20:39.938
What the hell, Austin?

20:43.374 --> 20:44.940
Hello. I'm George.

20:44.942 --> 20:47.209
- Hi, I'm Hailey.
- Pleasure.

20:47.211 --> 20:49.545
- What's Austin doing here?
- Oh, he just surprised us.

20:49.547 --> 20:52.113
- I might kill him.
- The feeling's mutual.

20:52.115 --> 20:54.349
Why did you tell your father
that we slept together?

20:54.351 --> 20:56.418
- I would never tell him that.
- He was all like, you slept with my daughter.

20:56.420 --> 20:58.821
- Did, did you just tell my father we slept together?
- He knew!

20:58.823 --> 21:01.422
- He's with our daughter in her bedroom.
- I know.

21:01.424 --> 21:03.091
This is for the two of you.

21:03.093 --> 21:04.559
Thank you both so much
for having me

21:04.561 --> 21:07.362
and welcoming me into your
home on Thanksgiving.

21:07.364 --> 21:10.431
Your daughter is amazing. I can't
tell you how much this means.

21:10.433 --> 21:13.367
- Lauren told me how important you are.
- Oh.

21:13.369 --> 21:16.305
- So, tell us about Austin.
- Yeah, what's his deal?

21:16.307 --> 21:18.039
Um, he's fine.

21:18.041 --> 21:20.007
He wants to kill me!
Legitimately kill me!

21:20.009 --> 21:21.410
Austin, I might kill you.
I might kill you.

21:21.412 --> 21:22.911
I might actually kill you.

21:22.913 --> 21:24.846
This must be tough.
You get jealous?

21:24.848 --> 21:26.515
- Of?
- Austin.

21:26.517 --> 21:28.115
It's okay, you can tell me.

21:28.117 --> 21:30.017
I guess. They're just so close.

21:30.019 --> 21:31.519
Of course.
They have a special connection.

21:31.521 --> 21:33.087
Special, my ass.

21:33.089 --> 21:35.324
And I understand.
It's totally natural.

21:35.326 --> 21:37.860
Well, I don't think
I've admitted that before.

21:37.862 --> 21:39.527
- Even to Lauren.
- Don't worry.

21:39.529 --> 21:41.263
It'll all work out.

21:41.265 --> 21:43.565
When they get married,
you'll still be close friends.

21:43.567 --> 21:45.199
Um, what?

21:45.201 --> 21:46.934
Oh, me and
Austin are not dating.

21:46.936 --> 21:49.071
Austin and I.
You were an English major.

21:49.073 --> 21:50.972
Why don't we go outside,
get some fresh air.

21:50.974 --> 21:52.242
We'll be right back. Come on.

21:55.346 --> 21:57.248
- Where the hell is he going?
- Stop.

22:00.384 --> 22:01.883
What's he doing here?

22:01.885 --> 22:03.285
Yeah, I was planning
on telling them,

22:03.287 --> 22:04.518
and then the doorbell rang
and my parents

22:04.520 --> 22:05.554
just kind of assumed...

22:05.556 --> 22:07.088
You were getting married.

22:07.090 --> 22:09.958
- He sent a turkey.
- He sent a turkey?

22:09.960 --> 22:11.093
I know, I know.

22:11.095 --> 22:12.928
Listen, I will make this better.

22:12.930 --> 22:13.996
Okay.

22:36.319 --> 22:38.519
- That is just horrifying.
- What?

22:38.521 --> 22:41.657
The neighbors do not need
to see this kid's pelvis!

22:41.659 --> 22:43.991
What are you talking about?

22:43.993 --> 22:46.561
I never liked the idea of her moving
in with some guy off of Craig's List.

22:46.563 --> 22:49.230
Oh, I remember vividly you saying:
"That kid's got a good head

22:49.232 --> 22:51.667
- on his shoulders." Remember?
- I'd like to knock that head off his shoulders.

22:51.669 --> 22:53.535
Oh, you don't like any
of Lauren's boyfriends.

22:53.537 --> 22:56.103
Remember that nice kid Johnny?
You gave him PTSD.

22:56.105 --> 22:57.340
That Johnny was a bum.

22:58.342 --> 23:00.574
Meanwhile, we invite this Austin
into our home for Thanksgiving

23:00.576 --> 23:03.411
and he clearly
deceived us with his intentions.

23:03.413 --> 23:05.413
How could you not fall in love
with our daughter.

23:05.415 --> 23:08.485
He's got her lying to us.
She never lied to us.

23:09.519 --> 23:10.954
Sweetie.

23:12.655 --> 23:16.094
Do you think she's pregnant?

23:20.263 --> 23:22.500
- Where's the sharpener?
- No, no.

23:33.443 --> 23:36.280
- What?
- It's my grandparents.

23:38.015 --> 23:39.748
So we're playing straight today.

23:39.750 --> 23:41.318
They're not listening to me!

23:43.686 --> 23:47.157
Maybe they'll listen to you. Why don't
you give it a try? Go tell them.

23:47.724 --> 23:50.028
- What?
- You go tell my parents.

23:50.594 --> 23:52.361
No. Okay, I just met them.

23:52.363 --> 23:54.532
I am not coming out for you.

23:55.499 --> 23:59.066
Austin.
Oh, what a surprise!

23:59.068 --> 24:01.202
Hello, Anderson grandparents.

24:01.204 --> 24:02.770
Call me Josephine.

24:02.772 --> 24:04.573
Grandpa gets it done.

24:04.575 --> 24:08.543
And don't you worry.
I got your smoked turkey.

24:08.545 --> 24:10.612
He's arm-in-arm
with your grandma.

24:10.614 --> 24:14.149
I am not with Austin.
I am with you, okay?

24:14.151 --> 24:15.584
They're going to love you.

24:15.586 --> 24:17.585
Walk along
like you know how.

24:17.587 --> 24:19.621
I'm waiting
for you, bitch.

24:19.623 --> 24:22.090
Oh, I can walk. Look at the...

24:22.092 --> 24:24.191
Oh, well, oh, good. okay. Well.

24:24.193 --> 24:25.293
Well, keep up.

24:25.295 --> 24:26.694
You're gonna be the death of me.

24:26.696 --> 24:29.131
Oh, the death of you
will be your cholesterol.

24:29.133 --> 24:31.499
Oh, really?
Did you ever hear of Lipitor?

24:31.501 --> 24:33.334
- Oh, wait a second.
- Lepicore?

24:33.336 --> 24:34.803
- Lipitor. Lipitor.
- I have no idea.

24:34.805 --> 24:37.139
- Ask your doctor.
- Ask... should I get some?

24:37.141 --> 24:38.472
Jesus Christ.

24:38.474 --> 24:41.378
- What are the side effects?
- Death.

24:45.315 --> 24:47.382
Keep walking.
You don't have to wait for me.

24:47.384 --> 24:50.387
- I don't need a helper.
- Well, you need something.

24:53.589 --> 24:57.625
Let's go in there so that they
can see you by my side

24:57.627 --> 25:01.298
and they can process it and I'll
clear this all up, alright?

25:03.400 --> 25:04.535
Fine.

25:10.173 --> 25:11.840
<i>Happy Thanksgiving!</i>

25:11.842 --> 25:17.612
Happy Thanksgiving.
I'm so happy everyone's early.

25:17.614 --> 25:20.782
You wore those pants again?
Look at them.

25:20.784 --> 25:22.284
- Yeah?
- Yes, I did.

25:22.286 --> 25:24.553
Well, thank heaven
I didn't dress up.

25:24.555 --> 25:26.353
Well, they're
very comfortable. Here.

25:26.355 --> 25:28.623
- They're very heinous.
- They may be heinous,

25:28.625 --> 25:32.626
but something smells
awfully good.

25:32.628 --> 25:35.697
Well, this is so great
because, you know,

25:35.699 --> 25:40.302
your son ate the entire pie I was
planning to serve for breakfast.

25:40.304 --> 25:41.769
Oh, pie is okay for
breakfast.

25:41.771 --> 25:44.538
Maybe everyone can
congregate in the living room.

25:44.540 --> 25:46.574
Austin sent me
one of those smoked turkeys

25:46.576 --> 25:49.510
- now I'm excited about Thanksgiving.
- Mm-hm.

25:49.512 --> 25:51.712
That's good.
This man ate a whole pie?

25:51.714 --> 25:53.481
Part of a pie.
She's exaggerating.

25:53.483 --> 25:55.150
- Pig, oink.
- Uh, everyone?

25:55.152 --> 25:56.852
Can I have your attention?

25:56.854 --> 26:01.189
- We're dating.
- Yes, Austin and Lauren are dating.

26:01.191 --> 26:02.724
- You're misunderstanding.
- Oh, no, no.

26:02.726 --> 26:04.860
- That's wonderful.
- No, Grandma. Stop it.

26:04.862 --> 26:07.228
- No, Grandma, stop kissing Austin.
- Oh, no, no, no.

26:07.230 --> 26:09.631
It's not what you think.
But it's very meaningful.

26:09.633 --> 26:11.732
- There's just a bit of confusion here.
- Yeah, listen.

26:11.734 --> 26:13.200
You work with Lauren?

26:13.202 --> 26:16.371
Yeah. Hailey is a lawyer, um.

26:16.373 --> 26:18.305
- She actually makes money.
- So do you.

26:18.307 --> 26:20.609
- How is the writing coming?
- Bet you got a whole lot

26:20.611 --> 26:21.712
of new material now.

26:22.613 --> 26:25.646
Her writing's going really well.
Tell them.

26:25.648 --> 26:27.716
- What kind of law?
- Uh, environmental law.

26:27.718 --> 26:30.352
- All about shrubbery and bushes.
- I love shrubbery.

26:30.354 --> 26:32.687
I don't know anything about
environmental law,

26:32.689 --> 26:34.823
but I learn something
new every day.

26:34.825 --> 26:38.492
As did I, madame, the day
I married you 'til today.

26:38.494 --> 26:40.295
What's the newest
thing you've learned?

26:40.297 --> 26:42.564
You, ma'am, have major game.

26:42.566 --> 26:44.231
- Alright, you two get a room.
- So, um,

26:44.233 --> 26:46.200
Hailey and I met in yoga.

26:46.202 --> 26:48.402
Thought you weren't supposed
to talk in yoga.

26:48.404 --> 26:49.804
Well, she hates rules.

26:49.806 --> 26:51.273
Hailey is not my friend.

26:51.275 --> 26:52.440
She's your best friend.

26:52.442 --> 26:54.375
I liked that picture of you

26:54.377 --> 26:55.911
two on Instagram last
night. That was beautiful.

26:55.913 --> 26:57.511
- She's talking about the LPAC event.
- Yeah.

26:57.513 --> 26:59.780
Lesbians for women in power.

26:59.782 --> 27:02.249
Yeah, we got a bunch of
feminists in the house.

27:02.251 --> 27:04.251
Are you two wearing
the same shirt?

27:04.253 --> 27:06.353
Okay. Come with me.

27:07.790 --> 27:09.857
Okay. Excuse me.

27:09.859 --> 27:11.361
He goes too?

27:15.798 --> 27:18.466
- They're not listening.
- I told you.

27:18.468 --> 27:20.267
No, like, they're really
not listening.

27:20.269 --> 27:22.603
I mean, okay,
they're still my family.

27:28.311 --> 27:30.344
Jesus Christ! How many times
do I have to knock

27:30.346 --> 27:31.880
before someone answers the door?

27:31.882 --> 27:33.248
What's with the girl in the van?

27:33.250 --> 27:34.682
- Oh, Jesus Christ!
- Mike!

27:34.684 --> 27:36.351
- Happy Thanksgiving to you too!
- Mike, Mike!

27:36.353 --> 27:39.286
- What?
- You heard me.

27:39.288 --> 27:41.488
I don't even know
what you're talking about! What?

27:41.490 --> 27:44.292
Oh, I don't believe you.
Where's the cranberry sauce?

27:44.294 --> 27:46.294
- What?
- I asked you to bring one thing.

27:46.296 --> 27:48.296
Oh, wait. Oh, woah, woah.
I brought wine.

27:48.298 --> 27:49.797
- Oh, great.
- I brought wine.

27:49.799 --> 27:51.868
So we're drinking again.
That makes me happy.

27:52.702 --> 27:56.374
- So, this is your bedroom?
- This is it.

27:57.708 --> 27:59.708
I'm so glad we're sharing
this moment with Austin.

27:59.710 --> 28:01.977
No one wants to out you guys
more than me right now.

28:01.979 --> 28:05.447
- Why exactly are you here?
- How was I supposed to know you were gonna drop

28:05.449 --> 28:08.382
- the lez bomb today?
- Why did you send a turkey?

28:08.384 --> 28:10.884
Because her grandmother
liked it last year.

28:10.886 --> 28:14.288
You're deliberately
trying to sabotage me.

28:14.290 --> 28:15.990
Shut up. Both of you.

28:15.992 --> 28:19.928
We'll go with the flow and when
the right moment presents itself

28:19.930 --> 28:23.998
- I will tell them we're in a relationship.
- Okay.

28:24.000 --> 28:27.434
Alright, listen, you just
have to rip off that Band-Aid.

28:27.436 --> 28:30.337
- I didn't want there to be any ripping.
- I know.

28:30.339 --> 28:34.409
- It's not how it was supposed to happen.
- Oh, I know.

28:34.411 --> 28:37.344
- Sorry.
- Hey, it's gonna be okay.

28:43.886 --> 28:47.424
- So, this is your bedroom?
- This is my bedroom.

28:48.491 --> 28:50.627
All of this was made here.

28:51.394 --> 28:54.796
How did you even fit on the bed
with all these stuffed animals?

28:54.798 --> 28:58.632
I don't know.
I'm actually not sure.

28:58.634 --> 29:00.802
- Who's this guy?
- This is Teddy.

29:00.804 --> 29:03.371
I lacked imagination.

29:03.373 --> 29:06.507
This is, like, quite the
introduction to 6-year-old Lauren.

29:06.509 --> 29:09.376
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

29:11.381 --> 29:13.315
- Hey, mom!
- Oh!

29:13.317 --> 29:14.615
- Happy Thanksgiving!
- All my children.

29:14.617 --> 29:16.418
Oh, it smells so good in here.

29:16.420 --> 29:18.420
- You look so handsome.
- Really?

29:18.422 --> 29:20.921
- Yes, I really like this hairdo.
- Why don't I have a girlfriend then?

29:20.923 --> 29:23.391
- This deserves a girlfriend.
- It's so touchable.

29:23.393 --> 29:25.959
Hey, I did bring
a little bit of laundry

29:25.961 --> 29:28.363
- Oh, how great, I love doing laundry.
- for us to do.

29:28.365 --> 29:30.532
But I don't know how to do it.
So I thought, you know, you.

29:30.534 --> 29:33.537
Yeah, we'll have a class
in that. It's all good.

29:36.772 --> 29:38.806
<i>♪ Dashing
through the snow... ♪</i>

29:40.777 --> 29:43.611
Honey, one holiday
at a time, please.

29:43.613 --> 29:46.081
- Can I have my phone back now?
- Jess.

29:46.083 --> 29:49.517
- Would you give her the phone back?
- Don't make me the bad cop.

29:49.519 --> 29:50.884
You are the bad cop.

29:50.886 --> 29:53.823
- Hey. Don't push it.
- Thank you.

29:57.027 --> 30:00.431
Okay, here we go.
Let's have a good time.

30:05.499 --> 30:06.101
Can I please
have my phone now?

30:06.103 --> 30:08.068
No.

30:08.070 --> 30:09.671
And don't slam the door.

30:09.673 --> 30:12.106
Can we just eat some food
and give thanks?

30:12.108 --> 30:14.476
No. I'm not thankful.

30:14.478 --> 30:16.577
How about giving thanks
for me birthing you?

30:16.579 --> 30:18.979
Push a child out of
your vagina for 32 hours.

30:18.981 --> 30:21.149
- You won't be crying about that phone.
- Mom, don't say vagina.

30:21.151 --> 30:22.820
And don't mention
the spinach dip.

30:25.654 --> 30:28.055
Hey, the good
guys are here!

30:28.057 --> 30:30.691
Hey! Hi, are you?

30:30.693 --> 30:34.129
I'm very,
very well, Maggie.

30:34.131 --> 30:35.863
- Hey there, beautiful lady.
- Oh.

30:35.865 --> 30:38.665
- Happy Thanksgiving, mom.
- You kiss her on the lips?

30:38.667 --> 30:41.402
- I love you.
- Hey, tough guy. How you doin'?

30:41.404 --> 30:42.737
- I'm doing great.
- Yeah?

30:42.739 --> 30:44.671
I feel great.
I got the appetite back.

30:44.673 --> 30:46.007
- How do I look?
- Like a 100 damn dollars.

30:46.009 --> 30:47.842
You actually
asked him if he felt good?

30:47.844 --> 30:50.014
Look at the woman's face
that he brought with him.

30:50.946 --> 30:53.914
- I mean, how could you not feel good?
- Pop, come on.

30:53.916 --> 30:56.017
Jessica. Hi, Mike.

30:56.019 --> 30:57.419
- Maggie.
- Hi!

30:57.421 --> 30:58.753
The whole gang is here. Great.

30:58.755 --> 31:00.555
- This is Hailey.
- John.

31:00.557 --> 31:01.956
- Hi.
- Do you want some meat?

31:01.958 --> 31:03.725
No, thanks,
I actually don't eat meat.

31:03.727 --> 31:06.026
- Oh.
- Are you a vegetarian?

31:06.028 --> 31:09.898
- Yeah.
- Wait, you're the one that turned my daughter vegetarian?

31:09.900 --> 31:12.033
No, actually,
she turned me vegetarian.

31:12.035 --> 31:16.069
- She doesn't eat meat, but she eats pie.
- So do you.

31:16.071 --> 31:18.506
- Mom, can I have my phone?
- Not until you learn that

31:18.508 --> 31:20.475
my privacy is my privacy.

31:20.477 --> 31:22.110
She has taken to filming me
in the bathroom.

31:22.112 --> 31:23.777
- Got enough?
- Mm-hm.

31:23.779 --> 31:25.913
On the toilet,
in the shower, waxing, shaving.

31:25.915 --> 31:27.748
- Waxing is my favorite one.
- Oh, my god.

31:27.750 --> 31:29.883
- Well, that's flattering.
- That's flattering, right?

31:29.885 --> 31:34.021
- Yes, the evil spawn.
- Real flattering.

31:34.023 --> 31:36.490
Somebody said
there was gonna be turkey.

31:36.492 --> 31:39.059
- You are an evil spawn, you really are.
- Oh, yes, it's hilarious.

31:39.061 --> 31:41.662
- You should have some wine.
- I don't want wine.

31:41.664 --> 31:44.833
- It's the bottle that Hailey brought.
- Great.

31:44.835 --> 31:47.501
Is there a reason
you don't want wine?

31:47.503 --> 31:49.970
- A specific reason?
- You like drinking?

31:49.972 --> 31:53.208
- That's it?
- Dad, I don't want wine.

31:53.210 --> 31:54.575
- Do you want the wine?
- Ahh, No.

31:54.577 --> 31:56.510
I'm thinking you
might want some.

31:56.512 --> 31:58.680
Lauren, can you grab me some extra
oven mitts from downstairs?

31:58.682 --> 32:00.949
- Oh, I'll go get them.
- The big... Lauren, can you

32:00.951 --> 32:02.816
show Hailey where
the extra oven mitts are?

32:02.818 --> 32:04.986
Mom, can you ask dad
why he's being crazy?

32:04.988 --> 32:07.555
- She doesn't want any wine.
- Where the hell is the turkey?

32:07.557 --> 32:09.257
Amen. I'm with Pop.
Let's eat.

32:09.259 --> 32:10.824
It's roast beef.

32:10.826 --> 32:13.260
- You need to talk to them.
- Okay.

32:13.262 --> 32:17.532
- You need to drink that wine.
- Getting drunk's not gonna fix anything.

32:17.534 --> 32:19.566
- They think you're pregnant.
- No.

32:19.568 --> 32:21.568
Oh, yeah. They think you
came home to tell them

32:21.570 --> 32:22.903
you're in a relationship
with Austin

32:22.905 --> 32:25.573
and you're pregnant.
Congratulations.

32:25.575 --> 32:27.040
Oh, my God.

32:27.042 --> 32:31.011
I just need to get my mom
alone for, like, a minute.

32:31.013 --> 32:32.515
Is someone smoking pot?

32:33.148 --> 32:35.552
I don't think so. Nobody smokes.

32:37.953 --> 32:38.989
What?

32:43.993 --> 32:46.760
My uncle is smoking
weed in Pop-pop's bathroom!

32:46.762 --> 32:48.997
My uncle, this, my Pop-pop
used to live down here.

32:48.999 --> 32:51.732
My uncle's in there smoking and shaving.
My mom's gonna kill him.

32:51.734 --> 32:54.201
- Why is he shaving?
- Why is he smoking?

32:54.203 --> 32:56.537
- Ask if he wants to share?
- That's not funny.

32:56.539 --> 32:58.139
- I'm not joking.
- I'll be right back.

32:58.141 --> 33:00.307
- No.
- Just give me, just give me five minutes.

33:00.309 --> 33:01.976
- No.
- Just give me... Please.

33:01.978 --> 33:04.312
Please just give me five
minutes to talk to my mom.

33:04.314 --> 33:06.180
You get one minute.

33:06.182 --> 33:08.115
Only 'cause you look
so cute in that dress.

33:08.117 --> 33:09.586
I like you in flannel.

33:10.252 --> 33:12.490
Relax. I'll be right back.

33:18.127 --> 33:19.960
Shit.

33:19.962 --> 33:21.629
Oh, good. Lauren.

33:21.631 --> 33:22.896
- No, not right now.
- Your friend.

33:22.898 --> 33:24.766
- No.
- Yeah, we had a connection.

33:24.768 --> 33:26.334
- There's no connection.
- Tell me one thing.

33:26.336 --> 33:28.135
What kind of guys
does she date?

33:28.137 --> 33:29.770
She is unavailable.

33:29.772 --> 33:31.171
- Hey, listen.
- What?

33:31.173 --> 33:33.708
Mike's smoking weed
in Pop-pop's bathroom.

33:33.710 --> 33:35.109
- Is he gonna share?
- John!

33:35.111 --> 33:36.944
What? What do
you want me to do about it?

33:36.946 --> 33:38.580
I just need everyone to pull
their shit together

33:38.582 --> 33:40.014
for five seconds
while I talk to mom.

33:40.016 --> 33:41.615
- Can you just help me do that.
- That's fair.

33:41.617 --> 33:42.917
She's in the
kitchen, you know,

33:42.919 --> 33:44.521
- basting away.
- Okay.

33:45.855 --> 33:48.722
- No. Where are you going? Stay.
- Where's Hailey? I just wanna have a stimulating

33:48.724 --> 33:51.895
conversation with somebody actually...
She seems smart. I'll see you later.

33:54.931 --> 33:57.632
- Here.
- What the hell? This cannot be right.

33:57.634 --> 34:02.069
According to this, the turkey's done.
According to this, we ate it already.

34:02.071 --> 34:06.841
Vegetarian or not, you need to
try the smoked turkey, Lauren.

34:06.843 --> 34:09.275
- It was a gift from your boyfriend.
- It wasn't.

34:09.277 --> 34:12.045
If she's gonna try meat,
it's gonna be my meat.

34:12.047 --> 34:13.780
- Can you at least try my gravy?
- I'm not trying meat today.

34:13.782 --> 34:15.717
Oh, yes, you are.
You're trying this gravy.

34:15.719 --> 34:17.784
- You really want to.
- How about I try it, and we can go talk?

34:17.786 --> 34:19.621
- We're talking right now. Try the gravy.
- We're not talking.

34:19.623 --> 34:23.090
Mmm. It's so good, right?
It's really good.

34:23.092 --> 34:23.893
Why?

34:24.860 --> 34:27.163
This is the best one
I have ever made.

34:29.364 --> 34:30.632
That is great.

34:30.634 --> 34:31.864
- Rose.
- Yeah.

34:31.867 --> 34:33.766
I hate to tell you.

34:33.768 --> 34:36.304
You don't fry with olive oil.

34:36.306 --> 34:40.842
No, I learned that.
Oh, they told us that in Greece.

34:40.844 --> 34:42.844
- Never.
- Okay.

34:42.846 --> 34:46.179
- We're in New Jersey.
- You use canola oil or coconut oil.

34:46.181 --> 34:48.282
Really? Huh!

34:48.284 --> 34:52.253
You know, when I was a young girl
and I had an itchy lady garden,

34:52.255 --> 34:56.657
- Excuse me?
- I put just a drop of olive oil on a cotton swab and

34:56.659 --> 34:59.730
- pat it down there.
- Oh, my God!

35:00.262 --> 35:01.996
That's so great.

35:01.998 --> 35:05.135
- How often would you do that?
- Every single time.

35:06.268 --> 35:08.735
- Have you ever had an itch down there?
- Never.

35:08.737 --> 35:11.139
- Never. That's never happened to me.
- Mom, I need my phone.

35:11.141 --> 35:13.141
- I need to film this.
- Oh, yeah, that's not happening

35:13.143 --> 35:15.275
because you and your friends
do too much of that snatching...

35:15.277 --> 35:17.278
- Snap-snapping?
- of drugs and naked pictures.

35:17.280 --> 35:19.213
- I'm not doing any of that.
- Okay, whatever.

35:19.215 --> 35:21.916
All I'm saying is your
generation is over-sexualized.

35:21.918 --> 35:24.284
No, that was never Lauren.

35:24.286 --> 35:26.119
What? You were an angel.

35:26.121 --> 35:29.123
Do you remember when you asked
me what this meant?

35:29.125 --> 35:30.992
- I literally wanna die.
- Wait, what?

35:30.994 --> 35:33.327
Some brat at school did that

35:33.329 --> 35:35.796
and she wanted to know what he
was talking about, right?

35:35.798 --> 35:38.365
Okay, can you stop making
that motion, forever.

35:38.367 --> 35:40.133
This...? You, no.

35:40.135 --> 35:41.802
Mom, let me live my life, okay?

35:41.804 --> 35:43.804
Tell them about
the Spin the Bottle.

35:43.806 --> 35:45.139
- Mom, this is not a roast!
- Okay, Lauren,

35:45.141 --> 35:48.008
Lauren called me
in seventh grade.

35:48.010 --> 35:50.244
- It was sixth grade.
- It was seventh grade.

35:50.246 --> 35:54.115
- It was sixth grade.
- And everybody was playing Spin the Bottle, right?

35:54.117 --> 35:57.284
I didn't want my first kiss
to be with some random guy.

35:57.286 --> 35:59.720
- Right, and you called me, your mom.
- Yes.

35:59.722 --> 36:02.923
I snuck off and called my mom
and asked her if I should play.

36:02.925 --> 36:04.891
- What'd she say? What'd you say?
- I said you should do

36:04.893 --> 36:07.327
whatever you feel
comfortable doing.

36:07.329 --> 36:11.833
But you hang up the phone and
don't tell anyone you called.

36:11.835 --> 36:14.334
- Loser.
- Yes, I was not cool.

36:14.336 --> 36:17.074
I miss those days.
You told me everything.

36:18.907 --> 36:22.175
I just want some clarification.
You and Austin?

36:22.177 --> 36:24.811
- Not together.
- Why are you keeping it secret?

36:24.813 --> 36:28.048
I'm not keeping it a secret! I've
been trying to tell everyone.

36:28.050 --> 36:31.251
- We're not together!
- I've got an idea.

36:31.253 --> 36:34.856
Take this, put it
in your hand and pray.

36:34.858 --> 36:38.525
And pray to God that
someday you figure out

36:38.527 --> 36:41.197
that you can
get your shit together.

36:42.798 --> 36:44.965
- Put that rosary away.
- What shit?

36:44.967 --> 36:46.300
- Put it away.
- Why?

36:46.302 --> 36:48.202
We only use it
for important things.

36:48.204 --> 36:52.240
God belongs in your house
every day of your life, lady.

36:52.242 --> 36:55.776
We're not talking about God right
now, we're talking about your rosary.

36:55.778 --> 36:57.878
Jessica, do you have a
boyfriend? Change of subject.

36:57.880 --> 36:59.380
I'm so into lacrosse players.

36:59.382 --> 37:02.016
- Is Austin a lacrosse player?
- Lacrosse?

37:02.018 --> 37:04.050
Where do you see
lacrosse players?

37:04.052 --> 37:05.385
You don't know what I do.

37:05.387 --> 37:06.954
Rose, I need more...

37:06.956 --> 37:08.255
Where are you going?
I need more chairs.

37:08.257 --> 37:10.224
- They're in the basement.
- Mike's, uh,

37:10.226 --> 37:12.159
- smoking weed down there.
- What?!

37:12.161 --> 37:14.394
How is that surprising?
What are you chewing?

37:14.396 --> 37:15.563
Nothing, I'm not chewing.

37:15.565 --> 37:18.335
Look at that! One of my cookies!

37:20.135 --> 37:23.170
- Mike!
- What?!

37:23.172 --> 37:27.141
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm shaving!

37:27.143 --> 37:29.010
- I smell weed.
- I'm shaving!

37:29.012 --> 37:30.845
You're smoking in our
deceased father's bathroom!

37:30.847 --> 37:32.146
- It's all in your head.
- No.

37:32.148 --> 37:34.282
I'm telling you, Rose,
stop it. Ah!

37:34.284 --> 37:36.416
- Rose, there's something wrong with you.
- Where is it, where is it?

37:36.418 --> 37:38.452
- What are you laughing at?
- Rose, I'm kind of worried about you.

37:38.454 --> 37:40.153
- What is so goddamn funny?
- You don't look normal right now.

37:40.155 --> 37:42.123
- You don't look normal.
- You are doing...

37:42.125 --> 37:44.492
No, I'm kind of depressed!
I've gotta relax!

37:44.494 --> 37:47.028
- Oh, yeah. That's called being an adult! Welcome to...
- Okay, Rose.

37:47.030 --> 37:49.896
You look like Grandma,
you look just like grandma.

37:49.898 --> 37:52.432
I am so going to kill you.
Goddamn it.

37:52.434 --> 37:58.371
- I have had it. I am not your goddamn mother!
- I didn't do anything!

37:58.373 --> 38:03.878
Right over there
I saw Lauren kiss Hailey.

38:03.880 --> 38:05.912
Lauren's dating Austin.

38:07.449 --> 38:09.617
Kids these days think they can
have their gluten-free

38:09.619 --> 38:11.885
cake and eat it too.

38:11.887 --> 38:14.121
Well, what should
we do about it?

38:14.123 --> 38:17.027
You do nothing.
I'll handle this.

38:20.262 --> 38:23.197
You put those hands on me,
you get bossy

38:23.199 --> 38:28.970
and it turns me on, still.

38:28.972 --> 38:31.438
- So, no meat at all?
- Nope.

38:31.440 --> 38:35.075
- Well, where do you get your protein?
- Oh, Hailey eats fish.

38:35.077 --> 38:37.945
Oh, right. Yeah, yeah.
There's a name for that.

38:37.947 --> 38:40.213
It's a p, p, pescatarian.

38:40.215 --> 38:42.182
- You're a pescatarian.
- No, I'm not.

38:42.184 --> 38:44.251
- Semantics.
- Maybe I should be a pescatarian.

38:44.253 --> 38:46.987
Hey, we were just talking about
Hailey's meat-eating habits.

38:46.989 --> 38:48.956
Austin's telling your
brother I eat fish.

38:48.958 --> 38:50.191
What do you think
about that, Lauren?

38:50.193 --> 38:52.059
Gosh, it starts
with a P, right?

38:52.061 --> 38:53.628
- Yeah, pescaterian.
- It's on the tip of the... No.

38:53.630 --> 38:55.496
- That's right. Am I wrong?
- No, it's not. That's not it.

38:55.498 --> 38:58.499
- Lauren? Lauren!
- Oh, no.

38:58.501 --> 39:00.133
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

39:00.135 --> 39:02.168
Not pescatarian.
I'll tell you later.

39:02.170 --> 39:04.104
I wanna make sure you're
comfortable, you know?

39:04.106 --> 39:05.972
Mi casa is your house.

39:05.974 --> 39:07.074
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

39:07.076 --> 39:08.541
You play lacrosse?

39:08.543 --> 39:10.211
Yeah, in high school.

39:10.213 --> 39:12.380
Hm. Nice.

39:12.382 --> 39:16.150
- Lauren!
- What's going on, Grandma?

39:16.152 --> 39:18.653
You never bring the side dish
with the main dish.

39:18.655 --> 39:20.121
Huh?

39:20.123 --> 39:22.322
You don't think I know
what's going on?

39:22.324 --> 39:26.327
- You and Hailey?
- Yes. Me and Hailey.

39:26.329 --> 39:28.262
Yeah. Wow.

39:28.264 --> 39:30.998
I didn't think that you'd be the
first person to figure that out.

39:31.000 --> 39:34.434
You like to share your vegetarian plates
and throw meat in when you feel like it.

39:34.436 --> 39:37.137
- Wait, what?
- You, Hailey, Austin.

39:37.139 --> 39:39.539
I don't care what you do on
your own personal time,

39:39.541 --> 39:43.177
but you don't bring the side dish with
the main course home for the holidays.

39:43.179 --> 39:45.012
No, I'm with Hailey.
There's not Austin.

39:45.014 --> 39:46.313
There's no side dish.

39:46.315 --> 39:50.050
Don't bullshit me.
He sent a turkey.

39:50.052 --> 39:51.318
I'm not bullshitting you.

39:51.320 --> 39:54.190
Hey, Lauren. Your brother's....

39:56.159 --> 40:00.594
- Yeah. John? Stop waving at my friend.
- Quit cock-blocking me.

40:00.596 --> 40:02.032
I'm watching you.

40:04.500 --> 40:07.503
Shut the door.
It's cold outside.

40:09.405 --> 40:11.041
Uh...

40:12.175 --> 40:14.278
I saw the two of you kissing.

40:17.045 --> 40:18.948
Nice seeing you both.

40:20.048 --> 40:22.048
What? What do you want?

40:22.050 --> 40:25.119
- John, stop hitting on Hailey.
- Okay. I think she might be into it,

40:25.121 --> 40:27.287
- so I really don't wanna stop.
- She's not into it. She's not into it.

40:27.289 --> 40:29.190
- Okay, she might be.
- She's not into it at all.

40:29.192 --> 40:30.590
You know what?
I'm picking up some things.

40:30.592 --> 40:32.025
And if you think I don't know

40:32.027 --> 40:33.327
when I'm getting the eyes,

40:33.329 --> 40:35.195
- Then you're wrong.
- There's no eyes.

40:35.197 --> 40:36.731
- You're not her type.
- This is one of those amazing,

40:36.733 --> 40:38.599
beautiful romances that's just
starting to blossom.

40:38.601 --> 40:40.367
- What are you talking about?
- You can't cover it up.

40:40.369 --> 40:42.103
- She just showed up!
- Well, yeah. You know.

40:42.105 --> 40:43.570
- John, listen to me.
- You have to relax!

40:43.572 --> 40:45.338
- I sense that you're worked up.
- Listen to me!

40:45.340 --> 40:47.344
- OK.
- Hailey is my girlfriend.

40:48.478 --> 40:50.610
Oh. Oh.

40:50.612 --> 40:52.679
- Okay?
- Yeah.

40:52.681 --> 40:55.249
- But, you made out with tons of my friends in high school.
- Oh, my God,

40:55.251 --> 40:57.617
- I made out with one and it wasn't Thanksgiving. Let it go!
- But you did. I saw

40:57.619 --> 40:59.487
- I owe you one. I owe you one.
- Don't... Put your finger away!

40:59.489 --> 41:01.222
- I owe you one.
- Put the finger away.

41:01.224 --> 41:02.623
Okay. You know what?
If you don't think

41:02.625 --> 41:04.124
I can make out with her,

41:04.126 --> 41:05.594
then I will take
that as a challenge.

41:06.429 --> 41:08.762
- Don't.
- You're room smells like farts.

41:08.764 --> 41:11.367
- Get out.
- So maybe you wanna do something about that.

41:24.780 --> 41:27.384
Why don't you get over there
so I can keep an eye on you.

41:37.393 --> 41:39.392
- You alright?
- Oh, yeah.

41:39.394 --> 41:41.662
Yeah, they just they did a lot
of cutting around the muscle.

41:41.664 --> 41:44.434
So you're gonna blame cancer
for your shitty golf game?

41:46.536 --> 41:48.137
You look alright, buddy.

41:48.704 --> 41:50.336
Don't lie to me.
I look like shit.

41:50.338 --> 41:52.009
Well, there's that.

41:54.677 --> 41:57.014
Hey, what's the deal
with dad and the rosary?

41:58.547 --> 42:00.049
Well, he, uh...

42:02.485 --> 42:05.222
promised to do the rosary every
day if you'd beat cancer.

42:06.588 --> 42:08.423
So, he's screwed.

42:12.494 --> 42:15.795
You look good, though.
You eating healthy?

42:15.797 --> 42:19.333
- From the guy who eats pie for breakfast.
- And lunch.

42:19.335 --> 42:21.668
- You know, George, I feel good.
- Good.

42:21.670 --> 42:27.141
- I feel like a teenager.
- Like a really old, out of shape teenager.

42:28.577 --> 42:31.547
Fore! On your house!

42:37.820 --> 42:40.590
Okay. I need a new thermometer.

42:41.824 --> 42:44.458
Lauren, get me a new
thermometer for Christmas.

42:44.460 --> 42:46.260
- That's all I want.
- Great.

42:46.262 --> 42:47.595
- I'm hungry.
- Hey, sweetie?

42:47.597 --> 42:50.498
I have your baby clothes
up in the attic.

42:50.500 --> 42:52.900
- Mom, there's no reason for baby clothes.
- Oh, okay.

42:52.902 --> 42:54.802
Is something burning in here?

42:54.804 --> 42:58.873
No, it's the smoked turkey?
I mean, my turkey's fine.

42:58.875 --> 43:00.374
- It smells.
- That's not a turkey.

43:00.376 --> 43:01.876
Yeah, what's with
the smoked turkey?

43:01.878 --> 43:04.211
- It's a family tradition.
- Hailey, what's up?

43:04.213 --> 43:06.412
I am gonna be
an awesome grandma.

43:06.414 --> 43:10.751
Yo, would a rational,
pregnant person do this?!

43:10.753 --> 43:13.623
- Yeah, boy. Oh, boy.
- God. Wow. Oh, Wow.

43:14.757 --> 43:16.824
No, no way to get that.

43:16.826 --> 43:19.492
- Oh, my god, no.
- So awesome.

43:19.494 --> 43:21.494
- There's no baby.
- You just killed it.

43:21.496 --> 43:24.632
There was never a baby, mom.
There was never a baby.

43:25.867 --> 43:27.367
- Get the turkey!
- Wait, wait!

43:27.369 --> 43:29.369
Okay, everybody out now!

43:33.208 --> 43:35.342
Save the turkey and get out!
Come on!

43:35.344 --> 43:38.311
Hailey and I have
been dating for six months.

43:38.313 --> 43:40.581
No one seems
to give a shit about anything.

43:40.583 --> 43:42.916
- Move, move get out!
- Alright, we're coming!

43:44.786 --> 43:46.887
George! Where are mom and dad?

43:46.889 --> 43:49.190
Has anybody seen my brother?

43:49.192 --> 43:51.561
Okay, we gotta go now.
We gotta go.

43:52.327 --> 43:55.831
<i>The house is okay, but the
basement's got a lot of smoke damage.</i>

43:56.599 --> 43:59.336
- <i>What caused the fire?</i>
- <i>A joint, Chief.</i>

44:01.536 --> 44:02.805
<i>Does he wanna
share?</i>

44:04.606 --> 44:08.943
It's gonna be ok, mom. Why don't we
go to the motel and have Thanksgiving there?

44:08.945 --> 44:11.912
Yeah, okay. Okay.

44:13.583 --> 44:16.950
- Oh, my God, it's all dad's stuff.
- I know.

44:16.952 --> 44:18.952
His...

44:18.954 --> 44:21.324
- His baseball bats.
- I know.

44:23.391 --> 44:25.858
- It's gonna be okay.
- His bird box and...

44:25.860 --> 44:28.697
- It's gonna be okay.
- Oh, God.

44:31.233 --> 44:32.633
- Yeah.
- Um.

44:32.635 --> 44:33.934
I'll be right back.
Are you gonna be okay?

44:33.936 --> 44:35.305
Yep.

44:39.641 --> 44:41.976
- Oh! Oh.
- Happy Thanksgiving, Rose.

44:41.978 --> 44:44.010
- Oh, Happy Thanksgiving to you, too.
- And that is one hell of a way

44:44.012 --> 44:45.748
to smoke a turkey.

44:48.284 --> 44:49.849
Dick.

44:49.851 --> 44:51.584
Hey, where are you going?

44:51.586 --> 44:54.021
Your brother's going to give
me a ride to the station.

44:54.023 --> 44:55.889
I tried to tell them,
you heard me.

44:55.891 --> 44:59.392
No, I know, I'm sorry. Look,
I'm just really uncomfortable.

44:59.394 --> 45:00.860
- I mean, this is crazy, right?
- John?

45:00.862 --> 45:02.795
- What?
- Hailey's staying. You're staying.

45:02.797 --> 45:04.498
No, she said she wanted a ride.
I'll give her a ride.

45:04.500 --> 45:05.865
What's your deal anyway?
You seem

45:05.867 --> 45:07.601
- really depressed.
- Give me Hailey's bag.

45:07.603 --> 45:09.737
I can hold onto a bag, okay?

45:09.739 --> 45:14.374
You have to stay, please.
I need my friend's support.

45:14.376 --> 45:18.311
Look, I get it that your family doesn't
wanna hear about your <i>friend</i> today.

45:18.313 --> 45:19.746
But I think they need to know.

45:19.748 --> 45:22.349
I need to know that my
friend has my back.

45:22.351 --> 45:25.619
And I need my friend to be open
and honest about her feelings.

45:25.621 --> 45:27.487
Friends are there even
when it's inconvenient.

45:27.489 --> 45:29.322
They're there when you
need them the most.

45:29.324 --> 45:31.758
She sounds like she's pretty
hard to be friends with, right?

45:31.760 --> 45:33.961
- Probably not even bother.
- Give me Hailey's bag.

45:33.963 --> 45:35.896
- Hey, you should mediate a little bit.
- Give me Hailey's bag.

45:35.898 --> 45:37.563
- Sibling rivalry. Hey, guys.
- I think it would be good.

45:37.565 --> 45:39.432
- Who am I riding with?
- Guys, we can,

45:39.434 --> 45:42.369
we can fit we can fit
three in our backseat.

45:42.371 --> 45:45.773
- Mom, you're gonna get sick.
- Hey, we got the food in the driveway!

45:45.775 --> 45:48.508
- We can have, like, a picnic, man!
- Oh, make him be quiet.

45:48.510 --> 45:50.510
- It's a beautiful day, you know!
- Make him shut up.

45:50.512 --> 45:52.646
- Make him shut up or I will die.
- Come on, we're all here, you know?

45:52.648 --> 45:54.947
I mean, there's no reason
we all gotta climb

45:54.949 --> 45:57.016
in the car and go to the motel!

45:57.018 --> 45:58.851
- Seriously!
- Hey, Austin.

45:58.853 --> 46:00.920
My parents said
you're coming with us.

46:00.922 --> 46:02.356
Cool.

46:02.358 --> 46:03.626
- Uhh.
- I know.

46:04.527 --> 46:06.526
- We're just gonna go to the motel.
- Okay.

46:06.528 --> 46:09.329
And we're gonna have a perfect
Thanksgiving dinner.

46:09.331 --> 46:11.932
- You're gonna come.
- You are a saint

46:11.934 --> 46:13.666
for putting up with all this.

46:13.668 --> 46:16.869
- Oh, Mrs. Anderson.
- Oh, it's gonna be okay.

46:16.871 --> 46:20.007
These are Ken's keys, and this
is Ken's car, but it's just

46:20.009 --> 46:21.708
- they're not working for Ken and...
- Sweetie

46:21.710 --> 46:23.677
find the keys
that work for that car

46:23.679 --> 46:26.646
or find a car that
goes with those keys, okay?

46:26.648 --> 46:28.514
Johnny?
Put on your big boy pants.

46:28.516 --> 46:31.084
Don't let the panic win.
So, you're coming back

46:31.086 --> 46:33.387
to the motel with us, right?

46:33.389 --> 46:35.021
- Oh, yes, you are. Yes, you are.
- Yeah.

46:35.023 --> 46:38.025
- Thank you so much for having me.
- Oh, you're welcome.

46:38.027 --> 46:39.760
- So, we're just all gonna go to the motel?
- Yep.

46:39.762 --> 46:42.396
- Alright. Roommates.
- John!

46:42.398 --> 46:43.963
- What?
- Leave Hailey alone.

46:43.965 --> 46:45.965
I'm not, not leaving her alone.

46:45.967 --> 46:47.934
- You're talking too much.
- I've been talking to everybody.

46:47.936 --> 46:49.737
- Stop it, just go away.
- Guys, guys?

46:49.739 --> 46:51.472
- Stop it, just go away.
- Guys, guys?

46:51.474 --> 46:52.673
- I can't go in the house.
- Okay.

46:52.675 --> 46:54.541
- He's a moron.
- Here we go.

46:54.543 --> 46:56.008
- He's a moron.
- Here we go, come.

46:56.010 --> 46:59.579
I'm sorry. I'm sorry
he's harassing you.

46:59.581 --> 47:01.414
- Work on your attitude!
- We're good?

47:01.416 --> 47:03.883
- Shut up!
- We're all good!

47:16.465 --> 47:17.998
What's with the smoked turkey?

47:18.000 --> 47:20.099
How many times are we gonna go
through this today?

47:20.101 --> 47:21.735
Austin sent it.

47:21.737 --> 47:23.807
What? He doesn't
like <i>your</i> turkey?

47:24.606 --> 47:26.139
Does Austin not like my turkey?

47:26.141 --> 47:27.974
No, mom. It was just a gesture.

47:27.976 --> 47:31.043
It was a peace offering.
He knew I wanted to kill him.

47:31.045 --> 47:34.046
If you're gonna eat turkey
today, it's gonna be my turkey.

47:34.048 --> 47:36.883
See, Lauren? Your mom doesn't
want you eating Austin's meat.

47:36.885 --> 47:39.720
- I thought you don't eat meat.
- I don't.

47:39.722 --> 47:42.021
Do you have any allergies
I should know about, Hailey?

47:42.023 --> 47:44.758
- Just bees.
- Okay, I'm not gonna cook bees,

47:44.760 --> 47:47.494
so that's fine.
I was gonna make us dinner.

47:47.496 --> 47:48.898
Oh, my God.

48:00.775 --> 48:01.577
Oh.

48:02.844 --> 48:05.646
So, now, how long have you and
Lauren been officially together?

48:05.648 --> 48:07.581
- Yeah, no, it's not official.
- Oh.

48:07.583 --> 48:10.016
- What the hell would you call it?
- Keeping your options open?

48:10.018 --> 48:11.818
Yep, nope! that's not...

48:11.820 --> 48:15.188
Not keeping our options open.
We're just roommates.

48:15.190 --> 48:17.057
Mm-hm.

48:17.059 --> 48:18.561
Roommates.

48:19.594 --> 48:21.961
No phone. Disgusting casserole.

48:21.963 --> 48:25.566
Hey, it is not a casserole,
it is a spinach dip.

48:25.568 --> 48:29.936
And it's the best goddamn spinach
dip in this part of the country.

48:29.938 --> 48:32.673
- Yeah.
- Salty, it's buttery,

48:32.675 --> 48:34.775
the edges get
a little bit texture-y.

48:34.777 --> 48:37.677
It's fantastic. That, to me,
I mean, I don't know.

48:37.679 --> 48:40.680
- It just seems perfect.
- Well, also I steam...

48:40.682 --> 48:44.684
If you pull it out a little early,
sometimes we get a situation.

49:21.990 --> 49:23.460
Are you kidding me?

49:27.195 --> 49:28.896
- Hey, mom?
- Yeah, sweetie.

49:28.898 --> 49:31.130
Let's try to enjoy
what's left of the day.

49:31.132 --> 49:33.967
Pop-pop would have wanted us to
have a lovely Thanksgiving.

49:33.969 --> 49:37.170
- That was very well put.
- Okay? Okay?

49:37.172 --> 49:39.007
- Alright?
- Wait a sec, what?

49:39.875 --> 49:41.541
Probably I'll stay
over there and we'll...

49:41.543 --> 49:43.644
Hey, John, maybe make
yourself useful.

49:43.646 --> 49:45.711
Yeah, no problem. I was just saying
we could figure out sleeping

49:45.713 --> 49:46.880
arrangements whenever
it's good for everyone.

49:46.882 --> 49:48.215
We're obviously sharing a room.

49:48.217 --> 49:49.615
It's not an option.

49:49.617 --> 49:51.284
Hey, listen. My mom is at

49:51.286 --> 49:54.787
boiling point. Let me just bring
her back to zero, okay?

49:54.789 --> 49:56.188
I get it. I get it.

49:56.190 --> 49:59.027
It's all about preserving
your mom's emotions.

49:59.894 --> 50:02.195
You know, maybe I should
just get together with John.

50:02.197 --> 50:04.898
- That'll make her happy.
- You're being ridiculous.

50:04.900 --> 50:07.066
Your cousin
is sexually harassing me.

50:07.068 --> 50:10.771
You need to deal with that. I can't
deal with anything else today.

50:10.773 --> 50:12.008
- Can you take this?
- Yeah.

50:13.175 --> 50:15.211
Okay, okay, I got it. I got it.

50:16.045 --> 50:18.110
What is going on here? This
parking lot is for guests only.

50:18.112 --> 50:20.916
- Hey, is everything okay here?
- Everything is great.

50:22.117 --> 50:23.753
Guests only, please.

50:24.320 --> 50:26.186
- I'm with Mike.
- Yeah.

50:26.188 --> 50:30.222
She's, uh... Ro... Emma.
This is my guest.

50:30.224 --> 50:32.092
- Yes, hello, family
- Yeah.

50:32.094 --> 50:34.327
that was not supposed
to be here with me today.

50:34.329 --> 50:36.095
- We had this little accident at the house.
- Little accident?

50:36.097 --> 50:38.097
- Little? Little my ass
- Is everything okay here?

50:38.099 --> 50:40.266
- You're little. You're little.
- Is everything okay here, mom?

50:40.268 --> 50:41.901
- Jeez.
- Everything is fine.

50:41.903 --> 50:43.670
- Bring it down a notch.
- Everything's fine.

50:43.672 --> 50:45.905
Come on. We're gonna
go have some dinner and

50:45.907 --> 50:48.675
our bellies will be full of
surprise, we'll be on our way.

50:48.677 --> 50:52.813
Let's, you know, we'll... Let's make
the most of it, the best of it.

50:52.815 --> 50:54.914
Right? The best of it.

50:54.916 --> 50:57.016
Hey, mom, can I grab a key for
me and Hailey to grab a room?

50:57.018 --> 50:58.784
- Yes, go ahead.
- Okay. You good here?

50:58.786 --> 50:59.922
Yeah, I'm great here.

51:04.994 --> 51:07.730
I'm looking at you.
I'm looking at you.

51:11.300 --> 51:15.936
You know, today was supposed
to be a really important day.

51:15.938 --> 51:18.671
Yeah, well, how was
I supposed to know that?

51:18.673 --> 51:22.208
- Why exactly are you here?
- 'Cause, I like Lauren's family.

51:22.210 --> 51:24.077
- What?
- You like Lauren.

51:24.079 --> 51:27.880
Okay. Alright. Alright.
Look, you're frustrated,

51:27.882 --> 51:30.784
because her family
welcomed me with open arms.

51:30.786 --> 51:32.318
- No, no.
- Yeah.

51:32.320 --> 51:34.121
I'm frustrated because you've

51:34.123 --> 51:37.057
managed to hijack
the entire day.

51:37.059 --> 51:40.126
- They think you guys are a couple.
- That's not my fault.

51:40.128 --> 51:44.430
You and Lauren are never going
to be a couple, okay?

51:44.432 --> 51:46.802
I hope you realize that.

51:50.938 --> 51:55.742
You guys have been dating
for six months, right?

51:55.744 --> 51:57.880
We've been living together
for three years.

51:59.815 --> 52:01.184
Guess who knows Lauren better?

52:05.019 --> 52:07.454
- How the hell did Mike start that fire?
- Smoking pot.

52:07.456 --> 52:10.322
- Where'd he get the weed?
- He's probably dealing again.

52:10.324 --> 52:13.193
- I didn't realize he was selling ever.
- Oh, yeah.

52:13.195 --> 52:14.927
Interesting.

52:14.929 --> 52:17.296
- Interesting.
- Failed at it, of course.

52:17.298 --> 52:19.432
- He'll probably fail at it again.
- Yeah.

52:19.434 --> 52:21.901
- They're ripping out the flowers again!
- Who?

52:21.903 --> 52:23.704
- I don't...
- Holy...!

52:23.706 --> 52:25.141
Fuck!

52:25.940 --> 52:27.974
Johnny, stop pretending to help.
You can actually help.

52:27.976 --> 52:29.909
Well, it's heavier
than it looks, mom.

52:29.911 --> 52:31.711
I'm putting the spinach
dip right here.

52:31.713 --> 52:33.179
Okay, that's great, Maggie.

52:41.422 --> 52:44.224
- I can do that.
- Let me help you with this, Mrs. Anderson.

52:44.226 --> 52:46.793
I'm happy to help.
I can just spread

52:46.795 --> 52:50.066
a tablecloth or whatever
I need to do here.

52:51.467 --> 52:53.266
Relax if you want or...

52:53.268 --> 52:54.903
Oh! Yeah.

53:02.811 --> 53:04.043
- George?
- Hey!

53:04.045 --> 53:05.445
Watch the damn turkey video.

53:05.447 --> 53:07.414
Okay, I will watch the video.

53:07.416 --> 53:09.081
- Now.
- Absolutely.

53:09.083 --> 53:11.418
- Why wouldn't I?
- Rose!

53:11.420 --> 53:12.688
Somebody's calling!

53:13.288 --> 53:15.224
Would you mind
closing the door, honey?

53:23.331 --> 53:24.933
- Yeah?
- Ah-hah.

53:26.835 --> 53:29.034
Your brother and his friend.

53:29.036 --> 53:30.903
Yeah, I know, I know.
What the hell's going on here?

53:30.905 --> 53:33.840
Let me call the police.
I got this.

53:33.842 --> 53:35.842
I can't call the cops on Mikey.

53:35.844 --> 53:39.979
That's why you're gonna let me
call the cops on him, okay?

53:39.981 --> 53:42.150
- I can't.
- Yeah, you can do it.

53:43.818 --> 53:47.920
- Just come inside and just act normal.
- I am not going inside.

53:47.922 --> 53:50.123
- Are you out of your mind?
- Please come inside?

53:50.125 --> 53:52.992
Please come inside?
Do you wanna get this done?

53:52.994 --> 53:55.262
- Oh, my...
- Are we gonna get this done? Are we gonna be professional?

53:55.264 --> 53:57.396
- Let's go inside.
- Do you wanna be professional?

53:57.398 --> 53:59.132
- I am a professional.
- Do you wanna try and be a professional?

53:59.134 --> 54:00.833
Oh, my God! You are
the absolute worst!

54:00.835 --> 54:02.369
I've been a professional
for a while.

54:02.371 --> 54:03.470
Oh, yeah, so professional.

54:03.472 --> 54:05.905
We can stay in here tonight.

54:05.907 --> 54:07.976
Shouldn't we be sleeping
in separate beds?

54:08.976 --> 54:10.879
Funny.

54:11.547 --> 54:13.146
Lauren. Okay.

54:13.148 --> 54:15.151
I think Uncle
Mike's dating a gay lady.

54:16.385 --> 54:18.584
Yeah. I know a lesbian
when I see one.

54:18.586 --> 54:20.353
- Hi, Hailey.
- Hey.

54:20.355 --> 54:21.954
What are you doin'?
What are you guys doin'?

54:21.956 --> 54:23.326
- Okay, bye.
- Okay, bye.

54:24.293 --> 54:27.159
- Impeccable gaydar, that one.
- Spot on.

54:27.161 --> 54:29.329
I'm glad there's so many
love connections happening.

54:29.331 --> 54:32.398
I know, and my whole family
will know about this one.

54:32.400 --> 54:36.938
We'll be laughing about
this someday, I'm sure.

54:38.373 --> 54:41.177
It's nice to have a moment
away from my family.

54:43.177 --> 54:46.278
I was really excited
to meet them today.

54:46.280 --> 54:47.382
I know.

54:48.617 --> 54:52.989
They're gonna love you. I'm
sorry it didn't go as planned.

54:56.925 --> 54:58.294
It just...

54:59.494 --> 55:02.999
doesn't feel good
not to be worth talking about.

55:03.632 --> 55:06.269
Of course you're
worth talking about.

55:07.101 --> 55:10.205
You know, I adore you.

55:22.617 --> 55:24.251
- Hey, dad?
- Hey.

55:24.253 --> 55:26.586
I really need to talk to you.

55:26.588 --> 55:28.921
Yeah, you and Austin
are not sharing a room.

55:28.923 --> 55:31.860
- That's not happening.
- I don't wanna share a room with Austin.

55:32.427 --> 55:34.594
It's the first
Thanksgiving without Pop-pop.

55:34.596 --> 55:38.632
It's really important that we
make this a nice dinner for mom.

55:38.634 --> 55:41.101
There's something I have
to talk to you both about.

55:41.103 --> 55:42.905
Oh, yeah, what's up?

55:43.572 --> 55:46.005
- Hailey and I...
- I mean, you're right about your mom.

55:46.007 --> 55:49.077
She's not having
an easy go of it

55:49.644 --> 55:51.313
with Pop-pop passing and...

55:53.248 --> 55:54.648
this place.

55:54.650 --> 55:57.920
Mike. She's sad.

55:59.353 --> 56:03.358
She misses you. You guys were
so close, you know?

56:04.192 --> 56:05.992
We're still close, dad.

56:05.994 --> 56:07.396
You wanted to tell me something?

56:09.431 --> 56:12.398
Let's just have a really
nice Thanksgiving dinner?

56:12.400 --> 56:15.334
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It starts
with the carving, apparently.

56:15.336 --> 56:17.970
- I mean, just watch the video.
- Is it just "YouTube carving,"

56:17.972 --> 56:20.407
"YouTube
comma carving?"

56:20.409 --> 56:25.481
"Turkey video carving" in the
Internet will lead you right there.

56:26.315 --> 56:27.613
Right there.

56:27.615 --> 56:30.349
This was supposed
to be an easy merchandise move.

56:30.351 --> 56:32.351
And now you're asking me to
pretend to be your girlfriend.

56:32.353 --> 56:35.155
Just relax, Emma.
Everybody's gonna be eating.

56:35.157 --> 56:36.555
You can do your business.

56:36.557 --> 56:38.458
Yeah, I hope
I can do my business, okay?

56:38.460 --> 56:40.427
You weren't even
supposed to be here, okay?

56:40.429 --> 56:43.095
- You don't mess with the cartel!
- Okay!

56:43.097 --> 56:44.965
And that's another thing
about the cartel!

56:44.967 --> 56:46.499
- I should be part of this cartel!
- Hey, guys.

56:46.501 --> 56:48.568
- I've been wanting...
- For the last time...

56:48.570 --> 56:50.470
- What are you guys doing out here?
- Not much.

56:50.472 --> 56:52.204
Nature.

56:52.206 --> 56:55.008
Question. You carryin'?

56:55.010 --> 56:56.476
What?

56:56.478 --> 56:57.613
You know. Hey.

56:58.746 --> 57:01.581
Oh, man, I don't even know
what you're talking about.

57:01.583 --> 57:03.717
Come on, Mike.

57:03.719 --> 57:07.052
Yes, hi. He is selling.

57:07.054 --> 57:10.289
Dude, this is my
sister's husband's brother.

57:10.291 --> 57:15.028
I don't care who he is.
We have merchandise to move.

57:15.030 --> 57:16.932
How much are you looking for?

57:18.300 --> 57:19.465
A joint?

57:19.467 --> 57:21.136
Now you're
just wasting my time.

57:21.737 --> 57:24.670
- Oh, mom's stuffing is so good.
- Thank you, sweetie.

57:24.672 --> 57:29.175
So, Hailey, how strict a vegetarian
would you say that you are?

57:29.177 --> 57:31.244
Hey, John?
We're exclusively vegetarian.

57:31.246 --> 57:34.046
I mean, can she handle,
like, a little sausage?

57:34.048 --> 57:37.016
Come on. What the hell's
the matter with you?

57:37.018 --> 57:40.019
I just want her to taste mom's stuffing.
There's bits of little sausages in it.

57:40.021 --> 57:43.255
I don't even know whether to
accept that as what that is,

57:43.257 --> 57:46.291
but it's the grimmest shirt I ever
saw in my life that you're wearing.

57:46.293 --> 57:49.095
Grandpa, I couldn't agree more. That's
the ugliest sweater I've ever seen.

57:49.097 --> 57:53.666
Well, truthfully, I don't love
it either, but mom picked it out

57:53.668 --> 57:55.501
- Wow.
- and she is great.

57:55.503 --> 57:59.572
So, Hailey,
I'm a good man with a good soul.

57:59.574 --> 58:02.275
There's a good chance I'm gonna
murder you this Thanksgiving, John.

58:02.277 --> 58:06.780
Yeah, well, I took out a hell of a
life insurance policy on myself

58:06.782 --> 58:08.782
so you can
make me a very rich man.

58:15.356 --> 58:18.159
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

58:19.126 --> 58:21.126
Mike sold me some weed.

58:21.128 --> 58:22.729
Oh, my God, we have a teenage
daughter in there

58:22.731 --> 58:24.229
and you're out here doing drugs?

58:24.231 --> 58:25.697
Barely. Come on.

58:25.699 --> 58:28.168
That is a shit ton of weed!

58:28.170 --> 58:29.836
Honey, they don't
sell it like they used to.

58:29.838 --> 58:33.373
- And you plan on smoking all of that?
- I don't know.

58:33.375 --> 58:35.543
Mike's girlfriend
scared the shit out of me.

58:38.313 --> 58:41.680
- How are you feelin'?
- Better.

58:41.682 --> 58:43.485
Well, get back inside,

58:45.152 --> 58:46.421
before you get us all arrested.

58:50.525 --> 58:51.693
What the hell?

58:52.561 --> 58:54.094
Do you need help
with the chair?

58:55.262 --> 58:56.695
Uh, no. I've got it.

59:07.476 --> 59:09.309
Hey, what you got there,
Josephine?

59:09.311 --> 59:12.744
- Digestive enzymes.
- Nice.

59:12.746 --> 59:15.283
Lot of food to digest today...

59:16.351 --> 59:19.251
as well as new information.

59:19.253 --> 59:21.289
What kind of information?

59:22.456 --> 59:26.726
Look what I found. Look what I found.
My spinach dip.

59:26.728 --> 59:28.193
Somebody's dug into it.
I didn't even get a taste.

59:28.195 --> 59:30.262
There was a guy.

59:30.264 --> 59:33.301
Oh, honey. It's perfect.

59:34.202 --> 59:37.637
Happy Thanksgiving.
Can you move, Johnny?

59:37.639 --> 59:40.240
Don't worry about
dropping it, it's dead.

59:40.242 --> 59:42.275
Here we go.

59:42.277 --> 59:44.744
What we need to do is carve it.

59:44.746 --> 59:48.248
It just needs to be carved and then
we're, we're good, we're all good.

59:48.250 --> 59:51.351
Rose, that turkey
looks like ass. Old ass.

59:51.353 --> 59:53.353
You know what?
You look like old... Mikey,

59:53.355 --> 59:55.655
would you please come into
the kitchen with me?

59:55.657 --> 59:58.227
- I'd rather stay here.
- I think I'd rather you...

01:00:01.228 --> 01:00:03.795
- Ow! You wrinkled my good shirt!
- You tell me what's going on.

01:00:03.797 --> 01:00:06.499
You tell me what's going on or I am
calling the cops on your friend.

01:00:06.501 --> 01:00:09.334
Sure, sure! She's my
girlfriend and I love her.

01:00:09.336 --> 01:00:10.605
- You love her?
- Yeah.

01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:15.374
- What's going on? What's going on?
- Nothing's going on, nothing.

01:00:15.376 --> 01:00:17.776
- You tell me what's going on.
- Nothing. Ow!

01:00:17.778 --> 01:00:20.648
You broke my rib,
or my ass or something.

01:00:21.550 --> 01:00:23.715
- Anyway, Hailey, I thought I could make you a plate.
- John!

01:00:23.717 --> 01:00:25.885
- I know you don't normally eat a lot of meat, but...
- John, she is

01:00:25.887 --> 01:00:28.521
- I am an immovable wall!
- not going to eat the turkey.

01:00:28.523 --> 01:00:31.356
Okay, I find this very awkward.
Oh, my god.

01:00:31.358 --> 01:00:33.825
You know, today might be
the day I try something new.

01:00:33.827 --> 01:00:35.862
- See? She might want...
- Am I allowed to eat?

01:00:35.864 --> 01:00:38.363
Oh, you're allowed to,
I'm just watching you.

01:00:38.365 --> 01:00:40.566
- She does not want any turkey.
- No, he's right, Lauren.

01:00:40.568 --> 01:00:42.668
I'd usually go for
a big hunk of breast,

01:00:42.670 --> 01:00:46.572
but maybe today I'd like a
juicy drumstick, you know?

01:00:46.574 --> 01:00:49.508
You're gonna have to move while I prepare a
plate because it's feeling very sexual...

01:00:49.510 --> 01:00:52.244
- This is the Thanksgiving I'm going to kill you.
- And you need to do this for me.

01:00:52.246 --> 01:00:54.613
- You're the best spinach dip maker in the world.
- You're pushing my buttons.

01:00:54.615 --> 01:00:55.815
Button push.

01:00:55.817 --> 01:00:57.684
Jesus Christ.
What have we got here?

01:00:57.686 --> 01:00:59.719
I'm gonna go cool off.
I'm gonna do my tens,

01:00:59.721 --> 01:01:01.653
- where I count to 10 in the other room.
- Yes, yes.

01:01:01.655 --> 01:01:03.690
And you need to
grow up while I'm gone, okay?

01:01:03.692 --> 01:01:05.557
because I can't deal with
your childish behavior.

01:01:05.559 --> 01:01:07.793
- I'm sorry about her.
- It's okay, John.

01:01:07.795 --> 01:01:09.431
Thank you
for being so understanding.

01:01:10.831 --> 01:01:14.766
- I know, but...
- I love you and I love this spinach dip.

01:01:14.768 --> 01:01:16.903
- Which do you love more?
- Happy Thanksgiving.

01:01:18.606 --> 01:01:20.572
I do like these chips.
I don't know if they're...

01:01:20.574 --> 01:01:21.576
What?

01:01:23.378 --> 01:01:25.577
Are you drinking?

01:01:25.579 --> 01:01:28.615
- Mom, it's a holiday.
- No!

01:01:28.617 --> 01:01:29.585
Don't... Get!

01:01:30.652 --> 01:01:32.651
Dad. Seriously?

01:01:32.653 --> 01:01:35.257
- Not happening, no!
- Getting the edge off, mom.

01:01:35.990 --> 01:01:38.458
The edge off of what?

01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:41.860
<i>Between the breast and
the drumstick, cut through the skin.</i>

01:01:41.862 --> 01:01:45.331
<i>Gently, but firmly pull
the drumstick and thigh away...</i>

01:01:45.333 --> 01:01:46.833
George!

01:01:46.835 --> 01:01:48.333
Uh.

01:01:48.335 --> 01:01:52.005
Okay. Why is
she carving my turkey?

01:01:52.007 --> 01:01:53.706
Put the skin down.

01:01:53.708 --> 01:01:55.675
Put the skin back.

01:01:55.677 --> 01:01:57.644
- Oh, put the skin down, Grandma.
- I got it.

01:01:57.646 --> 01:01:59.579
Why does the turkey
need a blanket? It's dead.

01:01:59.581 --> 01:02:01.780
It's more than a blanket.
It's tasty, tasty skin.

01:02:01.782 --> 01:02:04.416
- Terrible for cholesterol.
- The skin is the best part, Jo.

01:02:04.418 --> 01:02:06.619
There's Austin's turkey also
if we need it.

01:02:06.621 --> 01:02:08.854
- Are you kidding me?
- No, dad.

01:02:08.856 --> 01:02:10.456
- What's happening?
- Are you kidding me?

01:02:10.458 --> 01:02:12.358
- Alright.
- Is everybody happy?

01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:13.925
- Carve that turkey.
- Okay.

01:02:13.927 --> 01:02:16.762
The turkey that
I have been cooking all day.

01:02:16.764 --> 01:02:18.731
smells so
good from here.

01:02:18.733 --> 01:02:22.034
- It's no offense, Austin.
- No, none taken.

01:02:22.036 --> 01:02:24.070
The turkey looks perfect.
Sit down.

01:02:24.072 --> 01:02:26.505
- I'm gonna cut the turkey now.
- Wait a second. We forgot grace.

01:02:26.507 --> 01:02:28.574
- Oh, boy.
- Okay.

01:02:28.576 --> 01:02:30.376
- Ow.
- Oh, yeah, grace.

01:02:30.378 --> 01:02:32.445
- Oh.
- You wanna do it?

01:02:32.447 --> 01:02:33.780
- Oh.
- Uh. Um.

01:02:33.782 --> 01:02:36.682
- I can get this.
- Austin should lead grace.

01:02:36.684 --> 01:02:39.418
- Yeah, I don't mind.
- No, I got it.

01:02:39.420 --> 01:02:40.887
- I got it.
- Somebody say grace.

01:02:40.889 --> 01:02:42.688
That's more fighting
over grace

01:02:42.690 --> 01:02:44.057
than any grace I ever knew.

01:02:44.059 --> 01:02:45.624
Okay. Uh,

01:02:45.626 --> 01:02:47.559
First of all, thank you

01:02:47.561 --> 01:02:49.494
for cooking
this beautiful dinner.

01:02:49.496 --> 01:02:51.396
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

01:02:51.398 --> 01:02:55.400
Thanksgiving's
all about thanks and truth.

01:02:55.402 --> 01:02:56.903
- Amen.
- And forgiveness.

01:02:56.905 --> 01:02:58.737
And giving.

01:02:58.739 --> 01:03:00.807
And not groping
your sister's friend, John.

01:03:00.809 --> 01:03:03.675
But mostly,
it's about coming home

01:03:03.677 --> 01:03:08.947
- and coming out about things.
- Oh, holy shit.

01:03:08.949 --> 01:03:10.550
What?

01:03:10.552 --> 01:03:12.651
- You alright?
- You okay?

01:03:12.653 --> 01:03:13.952
Come on, Lauren.

01:03:13.954 --> 01:03:17.326
You can do it. Okay?

01:03:18.092 --> 01:03:19.460
Uh...

01:03:20.695 --> 01:03:21.830
Uh, mom?

01:03:22.797 --> 01:03:25.333
Is there something
you wanna say, sweetie?

01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:28.467
Lauren.

01:03:28.469 --> 01:03:31.570
Uh, we need wine.
Do you want wine?

01:03:31.572 --> 01:03:34.072
Do you want more wine?
We're out of wine.

01:03:34.074 --> 01:03:36.476
This table needs more wine.
Who wants wine?

01:03:36.478 --> 01:03:38.110
- I need some wine.
- Yeah, sure, more wine.

01:03:38.112 --> 01:03:40.947
I'm just gonna get a bottle.
I'm just gonna get some wine,

01:03:40.949 --> 01:03:43.719
- and I'll be right back.
- Grandma wants red.

01:03:45.586 --> 01:03:47.954
- Okay.
- What a lunatic.

01:03:47.956 --> 01:03:50.956
- We keep holding hands?
- No, eat up.

01:03:50.958 --> 01:03:52.791
No reason to wait now.

01:03:52.793 --> 01:03:56.662
Giving the worst graces.
I mean, that was the worst.

01:03:56.664 --> 01:03:58.130
Was that not terrible?

01:03:58.132 --> 01:03:59.632
I didn't get much.

01:03:59.634 --> 01:04:00.999
Well, I'm carving
the turkey now, dad.

01:04:01.001 --> 01:04:02.603
You'll have more in a second.

01:04:04.806 --> 01:04:06.875
Lauren! Oh!

01:04:07.942 --> 01:04:09.378
Okay, so...

01:04:11.713 --> 01:04:14.813
You and Hailey, you're dating,
aren't you?

01:04:14.815 --> 01:04:17.416
- Oh, my God, thank God!
- I knew it!

01:04:17.418 --> 01:04:19.552
Yes, yes,
please go tell everyone.

01:04:19.554 --> 01:04:23.021
Yeah, no. Your mother would freak out
if she wasn't the first person to know.

01:04:23.023 --> 01:04:25.724
Yeah, yeah, oh, my God.
Maggie, thank you so much

01:04:25.726 --> 01:04:27.592
for being cool enough to put
two and two together.

01:04:27.594 --> 01:04:29.729
Oh, okay, stay here.

01:04:29.731 --> 01:04:31.764
I'm gonna go get Jessica
so you can tell her.

01:04:31.766 --> 01:04:33.499
Oh, wait, I have to tell
my mom before I start

01:04:33.501 --> 01:04:35.034
- telling everyone else.
- Oh, yeah, no.

01:04:35.036 --> 01:04:37.039
I mean the part
about me being cool.

01:04:37.972 --> 01:04:40.807
I promise I will tell her
how cool you are after.

01:04:40.809 --> 01:04:45.211
Okay, good.
And what exactly is scissoring?

01:04:45.213 --> 01:04:48.847
Because I can touch my toes
but I can't do the splits.

01:04:48.849 --> 01:04:52.820
Oh, maybe we revisit this
after dessert?

01:04:53.588 --> 01:04:56.492
I gotta do the splits,
don't I? Oh, goddamn it.

01:05:03.797 --> 01:05:06.534
Oh, hey, sorry.
I was just washing my hands.

01:05:07.501 --> 01:05:12.574
You should really lock the door. Unless
you're looking for some company.

01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:16.708
Yeah, no, not looking for any company.
No company needed.

01:05:16.710 --> 01:05:17.945
I was just using the bathroom.

01:05:19.713 --> 01:05:21.646
- What are you doing?
- Looking for wine.

01:05:21.648 --> 01:05:23.048
- You're hiding.
- No, I'm not.

01:05:23.050 --> 01:05:25.818
Lauren, the wine's
next to the walk-in.

01:05:25.820 --> 01:05:27.920
- Do you wanna have sex right now?
- What?

01:05:27.922 --> 01:05:30.690
It's what you like, right? It makes
you hot, keeping it a secret?

01:05:30.692 --> 01:05:31.958
I don't like this
version of you.

01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:33.662
I don't like this
version of <i>you.</i>

01:05:34.963 --> 01:05:38.498
You are just so concerned about
everyone else's feelings.

01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:39.768
What about mine?

01:05:40.568 --> 01:05:41.733
Hm?

01:05:41.735 --> 01:05:43.038
What about my feelings?

01:05:46.875 --> 01:05:47.909
Fine.

01:05:48.976 --> 01:05:50.742
Come on.

01:05:50.744 --> 01:05:52.278
You're really young, okay?

01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:54.713
These are your formative years,
and you're gonna be

01:05:54.715 --> 01:05:57.115
a crazy heart-breaker,
but I am way too old for...

01:05:57.117 --> 01:05:58.818
Can you put your shirt back on?

01:05:58.820 --> 01:06:02.220
This turkey tastes soapy.
It tastes like soap.

01:06:02.222 --> 01:06:04.523
- Uh, mom?
- Whoa, what took so long?

01:06:04.525 --> 01:06:07.526
Dipping into the side dish
while we're all sitting here

01:06:07.528 --> 01:06:08.927
waiting for the main course.

01:06:08.929 --> 01:06:11.697
No, mom, I wanted to tell you...

01:06:11.699 --> 01:06:13.865
Lauren, you didn't
even remember the wine.

01:06:13.867 --> 01:06:15.834
That was the whole point.
Hailey, you can

01:06:15.836 --> 01:06:17.603
- have mine, I guess.
- John, let me talk for two seconds.

01:06:17.605 --> 01:06:18.970
- Okay, sure.
- Mom, thank you so much for

01:06:18.972 --> 01:06:21.773
putting all this
food together, um...

01:06:21.775 --> 01:06:23.909
- And?
- I couldn't be more grateful.

01:06:23.911 --> 01:06:26.045
I could not be more grateful

01:06:26.047 --> 01:06:28.748
to be able to spend
Thanksgiving with all of you

01:06:28.750 --> 01:06:31.150
- Last chance, Lauren.
- and be able to talk to

01:06:31.152 --> 01:06:35.186
You all so openly about,
like, life and gather...

01:06:35.188 --> 01:06:38.023
And I have an announcement
to make, everyone.

01:06:38.025 --> 01:06:41.896
Don't, don't do this like
this. This is not what...

01:06:43.864 --> 01:06:45.030
Whoa.

01:06:45.032 --> 01:06:47.766
- I'm going to kill you.
- What is this?

01:06:47.768 --> 01:06:49.635
Let's just French a little
and see what happens.

01:06:49.637 --> 01:06:51.206
What?

01:06:52.005 --> 01:06:53.905
No, it's not what it...
It's not what it looks like!

01:06:53.907 --> 01:06:55.840
No! Not, she kissed me!

01:06:58.211 --> 01:07:00.179
She kissed me! She kissed me!

01:07:00.181 --> 01:07:01.713
I kissed him, Uncle George!

01:07:01.715 --> 01:07:05.217
Why, you son of a bitch!
No, my baby!

01:07:05.219 --> 01:07:06.751
Grounded!

01:07:09.724 --> 01:07:12.791
No! I didn't mean to!

01:07:12.793 --> 01:07:16.929
Never! Stomp in the nuts!
You never know!

01:07:16.931 --> 01:07:19.865
- No, not mashed potatoes!
- Eat it! Eat it!

01:07:19.867 --> 01:07:21.601
It is mashed potatoes.

01:07:21.603 --> 01:07:22.802
Laurie! Laurie!

01:07:22.804 --> 01:07:24.336
Guys, guys, guys.

01:07:24.338 --> 01:07:26.905
Woah!

01:07:26.907 --> 01:07:29.641
That was my spinach dip. Yeah.

01:07:29.643 --> 01:07:31.644
Come up!

01:07:31.646 --> 01:07:35.680
- What are you doing?
- Hailey and I are in a relationship.

01:07:35.682 --> 01:07:37.085
Wait, what?

01:07:40.688 --> 01:07:41.856
Oh.

01:07:42.990 --> 01:07:44.222
Knew it.

01:07:44.224 --> 01:07:45.893
She's pretty, the little girl.

01:07:47.628 --> 01:07:48.931
You're a lesbian?

01:07:50.965 --> 01:07:52.701
A lesbian Hare Krishna.

01:07:54.168 --> 01:07:55.333
What about Austin?

01:07:55.335 --> 01:07:57.403
There is no me and Austin.

01:07:57.405 --> 01:07:59.708
Austin said you guys had sex.

01:08:02.409 --> 01:08:04.275
You slept with Austin?

01:08:04.277 --> 01:08:06.679
Sorry to interrupt,
but there are two men

01:08:06.681 --> 01:08:11.316
unloading what seems to be a
whole lot of weed from that van!

01:08:11.318 --> 01:08:12.721
Damn!

01:08:17.225 --> 01:08:18.694
I'm sorry.

01:08:21.127 --> 01:08:23.395
Hey! Hey, you guys!

01:08:23.398 --> 01:08:27.133
What are you doing with my
brother's girlfriend's truck?

01:08:27.135 --> 01:08:28.933
Girlfriend?

01:08:28.935 --> 01:08:31.836
- Emma, I'm so happy for you.
- Hell no, we're not dating!

01:08:31.837 --> 01:08:33.772
- Who the hell are you?
- We're the cartel.

01:08:33.774 --> 01:08:35.808
- Wait, this is the cartel?
- I'm Baba.

01:08:35.810 --> 01:08:37.308
- Cartel.
- Chino.

01:08:37.310 --> 01:08:39.745
- I'm calling the cops.
- No, we can't call the cops

01:08:39.747 --> 01:08:43.014
- 'cause we're accomplices.
- Oh, yeah. Hey, this is your weed.

01:08:43.015 --> 01:08:44.783
My parents do drugs?
You do drugs?

01:08:44.786 --> 01:08:46.718
- Wait, wait. Wait.
- Alright, alright.

01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:49.821
- You're pulling a sword on me?
- Your brother owes us money.

01:08:49.823 --> 01:08:51.456
- Take my brother!
- You can't let them take me!

01:08:51.457 --> 01:08:53.158
No, you are not
joining our cartel.

01:08:53.161 --> 01:08:55.760
- You are fired. You are fired.
- You can't fire me!

01:08:55.761 --> 01:08:57.429
- Okay. You are cut off.
- Oh, come on!

01:08:57.430 --> 01:08:59.165
- Give me your sword, I'll kill him.
- Seriously?

01:08:59.167 --> 01:09:00.700
- Absolutely.
- You've gotta make this go away!

01:09:00.702 --> 01:09:01.800
I didn't do anything.

01:09:01.801 --> 01:09:03.169
You gotta make it go away, Mike!

01:09:03.171 --> 01:09:04.903
I'm trying to come
out of the goddamn

01:09:04.904 --> 01:09:07.272
closet here, people!

01:09:07.274 --> 01:09:09.040
Jesus!

01:09:09.042 --> 01:09:11.376
What is happening? Hailey!

01:09:13.180 --> 01:09:15.216
Get out of here!

01:09:19.921 --> 01:09:22.721
That was my turkey, wasn't it?

01:09:22.724 --> 01:09:24.322
Alright. Alright.

01:09:24.323 --> 01:09:26.993
Well, does this mean
there's no dessert?

01:09:28.828 --> 01:09:30.395
Hailey? Hailey?

01:09:30.398 --> 01:09:32.397
- Hailey, open the door, please?
- I'm leaving.

01:09:32.399 --> 01:09:35.036
- I don't wanna talk to you.
- Hailey, please open the door.

01:09:36.270 --> 01:09:39.675
- Hailey, come on, open the door.
- Go away, Lauren!

01:09:44.345 --> 01:09:46.344
Why would you
tell my dad we slept together?

01:09:46.345 --> 01:09:48.848
- He knew.
- This is the worst day of my life.

01:09:48.850 --> 01:09:51.082
- Why didn't you tell your family about Hailey?
- I did, I've been trying

01:09:51.085 --> 01:09:52.384
- to tell them.
- Before today.

01:09:52.386 --> 01:09:53.952
Before she came, before I came.

01:09:53.953 --> 01:09:55.321
I didn't know you
were coming, Austin.

01:09:55.323 --> 01:09:57.092
You know what I'm talking about.

01:09:58.158 --> 01:09:59.892
I wanted to make sure
it was serious.

01:09:59.894 --> 01:10:01.227
You wanted to make sure
it was serious?

01:10:01.229 --> 01:10:03.161
I have watched you
dive head-first into

01:10:03.163 --> 01:10:05.196
over a 100 different phases
over the last three years.

01:10:05.198 --> 01:10:08.032
You remember when you were
into aerobic pole dancing?

01:10:08.034 --> 01:10:09.968
It's kind of that same thing,
you know what I mean?

01:10:09.970 --> 01:10:11.937
Don't compare Hailey to
a fitness class, Austin.

01:10:11.939 --> 01:10:13.371
- That is not fair.
- No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:10:13.373 --> 01:10:16.442
I'm sorry, it's not fair.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:10:16.444 --> 01:10:19.111
I don't know what to do,
I don't know what to do here.

01:10:19.113 --> 01:10:23.115
Well, I mean, it wasn't so bad to be
in a relationship for a day, right?

01:10:23.117 --> 01:10:24.983
I just need to clear my head.

01:10:24.985 --> 01:10:27.385
- You're avoiding my question.
- Question?

01:10:27.387 --> 01:10:30.156
It wasn't so bad being in
a relationship for a day.

01:10:30.158 --> 01:10:31.991
I mean, we've lived
together for three years.

01:10:31.993 --> 01:10:33.462
It always felt
like we were in a relationship.

01:10:34.863 --> 01:10:36.327
- Austin, what are you doing?
- It always feels like we're in one.

01:10:36.329 --> 01:10:37.865
What are you doing?

01:10:38.533 --> 01:10:40.165
You know me better than anyone.

01:10:40.167 --> 01:10:42.103
And I know you
better than anyone.

01:10:44.037 --> 01:10:45.272
No.

01:10:48.576 --> 01:10:50.442
Stop, no!

01:10:50.444 --> 01:10:52.881
Hailey! Hailey, please stop!

01:10:53.547 --> 01:10:56.150
Hailey, Hailey, Hailey!

01:10:57.518 --> 01:10:59.418
You had sex with Austin!

01:10:59.420 --> 01:11:01.519
It was way before you and me.

01:11:01.521 --> 01:11:03.589
You should've told me.

01:11:03.591 --> 01:11:05.491
What good would that have done?

01:11:05.493 --> 01:11:09.027
You know, I always said
your friendship was...

01:11:09.029 --> 01:11:11.330
You used to make me
feel like I was crazy!

01:11:11.332 --> 01:11:13.598
I didn't want you to worry
about anything happening.

01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:15.567
- You just kissed him!
- He kissed me!

01:11:15.569 --> 01:11:17.072
You let it happen!

01:11:18.038 --> 01:11:21.941
You know, I feel like
such an asshole.

01:11:21.943 --> 01:11:23.976
Here I am to meet
your parents and you two

01:11:23.978 --> 01:11:27.545
are just parading around
like a couple with a secret.

01:11:27.547 --> 01:11:30.952
It's not like that. I love you.
I love you.

01:11:33.287 --> 01:11:36.391
It's a really shitty time to
say it for the first time.

01:11:38.592 --> 01:11:40.394
I can't trust you.

01:11:41.194 --> 01:11:43.361
But I do love, I love you.

01:11:43.363 --> 01:11:44.629
You're the one I love.

01:11:44.631 --> 01:11:46.965
It's not him. Come on!

01:11:46.967 --> 01:11:49.567
This entire day.

01:11:49.569 --> 01:11:52.338
My family wouldn't listen to me.

01:11:52.340 --> 01:11:55.307
They are not the problem!

01:11:55.309 --> 01:11:57.876
- You are the problem!
- I, you...!

01:11:57.878 --> 01:12:01.981
Just, just stop. Just stop.
Just stop.

01:12:01.983 --> 01:12:03.616
You have no idea what you want!

01:12:03.618 --> 01:12:06.855
I don't wanna be gay, Hailey!

01:12:09.289 --> 01:12:11.956
Nobody wants this.
Nobody wants this.

01:12:11.958 --> 01:12:13.260
I'm sorry.

01:12:16.029 --> 01:12:17.832
I'm sorry.

01:12:18.431 --> 01:12:19.900
Thank you.

01:12:20.967 --> 01:12:23.204
Finally I have some honesty.

01:12:28.141 --> 01:12:30.979
I just, I can't do this anymore.

01:12:41.288 --> 01:12:43.988
- Where's Hailey going?
- She's leaving because of you.

01:12:43.990 --> 01:12:46.994
- I hope you're happy.
- Of course I'm not happy.

01:12:47.694 --> 01:12:50.094
Why didn't you just tell us?

01:12:50.096 --> 01:12:51.964
Mom, you don't listen to me!

01:12:51.966 --> 01:12:55.233
You need to be more clear.
I had no idea.

01:12:55.235 --> 01:12:58.169
I knew you were not
going to accept this.

01:12:58.171 --> 01:13:00.039
- I didn't know I had to.
- Just leave me alone.

01:13:00.041 --> 01:13:02.040
- I didn't know...
- Leave me alone.

01:13:02.042 --> 01:13:03.675
Just leave me alone.

01:13:03.677 --> 01:13:05.279
Let her go. Leave her alone.

01:13:08.248 --> 01:13:10.148
- She's so angry with us.
- Let her go.

01:13:10.150 --> 01:13:12.084
- She's, like, completely...
- No, no, not at us.

01:13:12.086 --> 01:13:14.018
- Not at us.
- Oh, my God.

01:13:14.020 --> 01:13:17.156
She's angry, yes. She's hurt.

01:13:17.158 --> 01:13:19.325
- Is she gonna be okay?
- She is gonna be okay.

01:13:19.327 --> 01:13:21.593
It's just gonna
take a little while.

01:13:21.595 --> 01:13:23.265
Women are nicer than men.

01:13:24.666 --> 01:13:30.134
Women... That's all you've got for me?
"Women are nicer than men."

01:13:30.136 --> 01:13:33.472
She follows her heart.
She's always followed her heart.

01:13:33.474 --> 01:13:36.177
- That's all she's doing now.
- Oh, boy.

01:13:37.211 --> 01:13:40.181
Oh, boy. Are we bad parents?

01:13:41.414 --> 01:13:42.917
We're...

01:13:44.685 --> 01:13:48.754
not terrible.
We're not great. We're, well,

01:13:48.756 --> 01:13:50.522
fair.

01:13:54.295 --> 01:13:57.595
Trust me.
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:13:57.597 --> 01:14:00.034
- Oh, okay.
- I promise.

01:15:29.090 --> 01:15:30.291
Coffee.

01:15:32.859 --> 01:15:34.362
Here you go.

01:15:35.496 --> 01:15:36.431
Thank you.

01:15:39.265 --> 01:15:40.534
How're you feeling?

01:15:42.569 --> 01:15:47.138
I know this is not
the life you imagined for me.

01:15:47.140 --> 01:15:48.442
Right.

01:15:50.110 --> 01:15:53.047
I don't think this is the life
you imagined for yourself.

01:15:55.181 --> 01:15:57.418
I'm sorry that I didn't know.
I'm sorry.

01:16:00.688 --> 01:16:02.222
It's okay, mom.

01:16:08.295 --> 01:16:11.265
I just thought Mike was the
only one dating a lesbian.

01:16:14.902 --> 01:16:16.434
Mom, who knew you were funny?

01:16:16.436 --> 01:16:20.207
I know, I'm very,
I'm very funny.

01:16:23.210 --> 01:16:24.509
You're okay with it?

01:16:24.511 --> 01:16:26.245
Oh, my God. Yes.

01:16:26.247 --> 01:16:29.184
Yes, of course I'm okay with it.
I mean, I need...

01:16:30.917 --> 01:16:34.088
I need to sort of
adjust my idea.

01:16:35.890 --> 01:16:37.356
Life never goes the way

01:16:37.358 --> 01:16:39.194
you expect it, that's all.

01:16:40.194 --> 01:16:42.097
But you're...

01:16:42.896 --> 01:16:46.234
Yeah, you're, you're good.

01:16:48.769 --> 01:16:50.238
Thank you.

01:16:52.372 --> 01:16:53.841
Is it okay
if I ask you a question?

01:16:54.675 --> 01:16:58.579
- What's the question?
- Is this your first time with a girl?

01:17:05.286 --> 01:17:07.122
I slept with...

01:17:07.921 --> 01:17:09.420
Elizabeth.

01:17:09.422 --> 01:17:11.322
- Which Elizabeth?
- A bunch more.

01:17:11.324 --> 01:17:13.692
Which Elizabeth?
College roommate Elizabeth?

01:17:13.694 --> 01:17:16.231
Oh, my God.
She's a little mouse.

01:17:17.898 --> 01:17:19.865
- So what? So what?
- Wow.

01:17:19.867 --> 01:17:21.569
She had hidden depths.

01:17:22.903 --> 01:17:25.603
- Can I ask you one more question?
- Oh, God, what?

01:17:25.605 --> 01:17:27.474
Did you always know
that you were gay?

01:17:31.645 --> 01:17:33.844
I just thought
I was really open.

01:17:34.948 --> 01:17:36.550
Oh, good. Someone's at the door.

01:17:39.286 --> 01:17:41.320
- Hey, Betty, how are you, honey?
- Hey, Rose.

01:17:41.322 --> 01:17:43.789
Hi, um, Ronnie said
you were here.

01:17:43.791 --> 01:17:45.656
- Yes.
- Here.

01:17:45.658 --> 01:17:48.293
Uh, my daughter
brought me the money.

01:17:48.295 --> 01:17:50.562
Well, I'm very happy
to hear that.

01:17:50.564 --> 01:17:53.168
- Okay, you have a good morning.
- Alright, thank you.

01:17:54.935 --> 01:17:57.302
Thank you for that.

01:17:57.304 --> 01:17:58.903
Do you wanna get some fresh air?

01:17:58.905 --> 01:18:00.375
I would love to.

01:18:04.310 --> 01:18:07.745
You know, my roommate in college
was a lesbian.

01:18:07.747 --> 01:18:09.748
- Did I ever tell you that?
- No.

01:18:09.750 --> 01:18:11.450
Mm-hmm.

01:18:11.452 --> 01:18:14.986
She told me I wasn't her type.

01:18:14.988 --> 01:18:17.555
I was so insulted.

01:18:17.557 --> 01:18:20.795
I don't even know what to do
with that information.

01:18:22.296 --> 01:18:23.461
So, I'm...

01:18:23.463 --> 01:18:27.366
Do you, do you, um, like

01:18:27.368 --> 01:18:29.367
having sex with men?

01:18:29.369 --> 01:18:31.937
I'm just trying
to understand. Don't get mad.

01:18:31.939 --> 01:18:34.542
No, I'm not mad. Well, I just...

01:18:35.743 --> 01:18:37.409
prefer women.

01:18:37.411 --> 01:18:39.544
It just clicks with women.

01:18:39.546 --> 01:18:41.349
It never clicked
that way with men.

01:18:43.417 --> 01:18:45.220
Why didn't you tell me?

01:18:47.354 --> 01:18:49.821
I think it was easier

01:18:49.823 --> 01:18:51.623
thinking...

01:18:51.625 --> 01:18:52.827
I...

01:18:53.993 --> 01:18:55.729
I think I was so worried that...

01:18:57.398 --> 01:18:59.764
that you guys
wouldn't be okay with it,

01:18:59.766 --> 01:19:02.237
then I never stopped
to think if I was.

01:19:02.903 --> 01:19:04.639
Oh, my sweetie, I'm sorry.

01:19:12.578 --> 01:19:14.345
- No, it's okay, it's okay.
- A parent is only

01:19:14.347 --> 01:19:16.647
as happy as
their unhappiest child.

01:19:16.649 --> 01:19:18.416
- I'm happy, I'm happy.
- If you're going to be this happy

01:19:18.418 --> 01:19:20.352
- I'm happy, I am.
- then I want me to be happy.

01:19:20.354 --> 01:19:23.754
I'm happy.
I'm just figuring stuff out.

01:19:23.756 --> 01:19:24.826
I know you are.

01:19:27.328 --> 01:19:30.298
- Thank you, mom.
- You're so welcome.

01:19:31.597 --> 01:19:33.632
Hailey doesn't hate you,
do you know that?

01:19:33.634 --> 01:19:35.733
- Hailey hates me.
- She does not hate you.

01:19:35.735 --> 01:19:37.402
- She hates me, she does.
- She does not hate you, she's hurt.

01:19:37.404 --> 01:19:40.037
And we like her,
just so you know.

01:19:40.039 --> 01:19:43.810
But you're the one who
has to be okay with it, not us.

01:19:44.610 --> 01:19:46.814
Thank you, mom. Thank you.

01:19:49.550 --> 01:19:52.787
I would do anything in the whole
world for you, you know that, right?

01:19:54.354 --> 01:19:56.323
- Good.
- Thank you.

01:19:57.957 --> 01:20:01.759
- This coffee's disgusting.
- I know, it's so gross.

01:20:01.761 --> 01:20:04.696
- It's Ronnie's special formula.
- It's not special.

01:20:04.698 --> 01:20:05.964
It's so bad.

01:20:19.947 --> 01:20:21.649
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:20:27.654 --> 01:20:28.990
You didn't say
goodbye this morning.

01:20:30.323 --> 01:20:32.857
Yeah, I thought I'd give you some
more time with your parents.

01:20:32.859 --> 01:20:35.927
Grandma took all of your
smoked turkey leftovers.

01:20:35.929 --> 01:20:38.129
I'm glad she liked it.
I promised her

01:20:38.131 --> 01:20:40.567
that I was going to
send her another one next year.

01:20:41.969 --> 01:20:43.704
I'm gonna move out.

01:20:50.444 --> 01:20:53.778
I'm sorry about yesterday.

01:20:53.780 --> 01:20:55.746
Austin,
the entire day was my fault.

01:20:55.748 --> 01:20:57.482
I'm talking about the kiss.

01:20:57.484 --> 01:20:59.049
I know. It's okay.

01:20:59.051 --> 01:21:00.621
I mean, I guess I...

01:21:01.788 --> 01:21:06.760
I didn't realize how serious
you and Hailey were.

01:21:08.729 --> 01:21:09.764
Yeah.

01:21:11.532 --> 01:21:12.900
I love her. I don't...

01:21:16.103 --> 01:21:17.736
I should have told her sooner.

01:21:17.738 --> 01:21:19.574
Yeah, well,
you should have told everyone.

01:21:20.573 --> 01:21:22.973
I should have told everyone.

01:21:22.975 --> 01:21:25.545
I should have
told everyone so much sooner.

01:21:26.846 --> 01:21:28.648
You're my best friend, Austin.

01:21:30.716 --> 01:21:32.652
If it was gonna be a guy,

01:21:34.054 --> 01:21:35.523
it'd have been you.

01:23:21.662 --> 01:23:25.597
...and in love too, it's fear that
often gets in the way of it's magic.

01:23:25.599 --> 01:23:29.134
- I'm sorry.
- Class started an hour ago.

01:23:29.136 --> 01:23:30.738
I'm sorry to use you.

01:23:31.904 --> 01:23:35.272
- I need to talk to you.
- What are you doing here?

01:23:35.274 --> 01:23:36.743
You deserve flowers.

01:23:39.212 --> 01:23:41.616
I wanna be the one that
gives you flowers.

01:23:43.917 --> 01:23:46.183
I was wrong. I'm sorry.

01:23:46.185 --> 01:23:48.652
This is all new and scary,

01:23:48.654 --> 01:23:50.992
and it's wonderful and exciting,
but it's scary.

01:23:51.792 --> 01:23:54.025
And that thing with Austin,
I'm so sorry.

01:23:54.027 --> 01:23:58.032
I should have told you. But I love you.
I'm in love with you.

01:23:58.998 --> 01:24:01.031
This is not how I saw my life.

01:24:01.033 --> 01:24:05.605
But it's so much better than
anything I could have imagined.

01:24:06.340 --> 01:24:08.339
I wanna be with you.

01:24:08.341 --> 01:24:10.075
If you'll take me back.

01:24:10.077 --> 01:24:11.979
Aw!

01:24:14.381 --> 01:24:16.551
- Is that a yes?
- Yes.

01:24:17.350 --> 01:24:18.885
I have something
I wanna ask you.

01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:22.086
Oh, no, I just

01:24:22.088 --> 01:24:24.891
feel really put
on the spot, um.

01:24:25.891 --> 01:24:27.127
Will you move in with me?

01:24:28.395 --> 01:24:29.794
Yes.

01:24:29.796 --> 01:24:31.632
- Yes?
- Of course.

01:24:40.940 --> 01:24:44.110
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

01:24:44.944 --> 01:24:48.849
Hey, I'm the best version
of myself with you.

01:24:52.653 --> 01:24:55.754
When are you planning to tell
your parents we're moving in?

01:24:55.756 --> 01:24:57.992
Oh, I was thinking Christmas?
