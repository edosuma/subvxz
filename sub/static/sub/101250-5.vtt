WEBVTT

00:13.888 --> 00:14.931
Meow.

00:18.393 --> 00:20.770
-[zaps]
-[Nari chuckles]

00:20.854 --> 00:21.896
Isn't it fun?

00:22.564 --> 00:24.941
[chuckles] How do you feel?

00:25.025 --> 00:26.359
Renewed.

00:26.776 --> 00:30.822
You-- I saw you as a child
in the Wild Wood.

00:30.905 --> 00:34.868
[Bellroc] Nari has a habit of playing
with humans,

00:36.036 --> 00:38.038
despite my warnings.

00:38.288 --> 00:40.790
[Skrael] It survived the reincarnation.

00:41.332 --> 00:42.667
-[Morgana gasps]
-Hmm.

00:42.751 --> 00:44.085
Surprising.

00:44.169 --> 00:46.296
I told you she could, Skrael.

00:46.379 --> 00:50.508
So old, and they still haven't
learned manners.

00:51.551 --> 00:53.052
Who are you?

00:53.136 --> 00:56.389
Well, I am Nari of the Eternal Forest,

00:56.473 --> 01:01.227
and that is Skrael of the North Wind,
and that is Bellroc.

01:01.394 --> 01:03.188
[Bellroc] Keeper of the Flame.

01:03.271 --> 01:05.148
We are the First.

01:05.231 --> 01:10.153
We have watched over majicks
since the stars were young.

01:10.236 --> 01:13.865
But man has destroyed the balance.

01:14.074 --> 01:18.036
[Bellroc] Just as they tried
to destroy you.

01:18.119 --> 01:20.288
But you brought me back. Why?

01:20.371 --> 01:24.584
Because you can right
what the mortals made wrong.

01:24.667 --> 01:28.963
[Bellroc] You come from their world,
but fight for ours.

01:29.047 --> 01:33.802
You will be the Eldritch Queen,
Mother of Monsters.

01:50.235 --> 01:54.572
You will be the instrument
of our reckoning.

01:54.823 --> 01:56.741
I accept this gift.

01:57.700 --> 01:59.452
You're doing great, Claire.

01:59.953 --> 02:01.371
[grunts, giggles]

02:01.788 --> 02:03.581
[grunts, chuckles]

02:03.665 --> 02:04.499
[screams]

02:04.582 --> 02:06.000
Channel your emotions.

02:06.084 --> 02:09.963
-Good. Now, let the world drop away.
-[laughs, crashes]

02:10.046 --> 02:12.465
[inhales, exhales]

02:15.135 --> 02:16.427
[yawns]

02:16.886 --> 02:18.263
[shrieks]

02:18.721 --> 02:19.681
[grunts]

02:21.057 --> 02:21.891
[grunts]

02:24.352 --> 02:27.021
Well, that's new. [purrs]

02:27.105 --> 02:28.481
What? No, don't-- Cut it out!

02:28.565 --> 02:31.109
I'm not a cat. I'm a dragon, currently.

02:31.192 --> 02:34.529
-[Aaarrrgghh roaring]
-[both gasp]

02:35.613 --> 02:37.782
-[Jim faintly] Hey, Aaarrrgghh!
-[gasps]

02:37.866 --> 02:39.868
-Jim!
-[Aaarrrgghh] Or I crush skulls!

02:39.951 --> 02:41.202
Jim! Jim!

02:41.494 --> 02:44.122
-Can you hear me?
-We're not joining Gunmar!

02:44.205 --> 02:47.584
He can't hear you.
It's a vision of some sort. But how?

02:47.667 --> 02:51.546
I just really wanted to see Jim,
and there he was in the shadows.

02:51.629 --> 02:52.839
Who else can-- Huh?

02:53.047 --> 02:53.882
[screams]

02:55.133 --> 02:59.304
I will find a way inside those walls.
Even Merlin will never expect...

03:00.930 --> 03:05.018
By nightfall, I'll strike down
my traitorous brother and Camelot,

03:05.101 --> 03:07.061
-ending a century of injustice.
-[Claire gasps]

03:07.270 --> 03:08.855
-Oh, no.
-Morgana...

03:08.938 --> 03:10.023
It can't be.

03:11.107 --> 03:14.777
You! My handmaiden, spying in the shadows?

03:14.861 --> 03:17.989
[screams, grunts]

03:21.701 --> 03:25.747
-[screams]
-Oh, man, this is one sweet tooth.

03:25.830 --> 03:27.206
She needs a name. Biter!

03:27.290 --> 03:28.958
No, no, no. Dental Destroyer! [grunts]

03:29.042 --> 03:30.919
Ooh, Molar Murder.

03:31.044 --> 03:33.504
[chuckles, grunts]

03:33.588 --> 03:34.672
-[screams]
-[both grunt]

03:34.756 --> 03:36.299
-Ha! [screams]
-[Claire grunts]

03:36.382 --> 03:38.551
-Ow!
-She's back! She's back!

03:38.635 --> 03:40.428
Slow down, slow down.
Who's back?

03:40.511 --> 03:43.223
Morgana's alive and coming for us.

03:44.098 --> 03:45.099
[Morgana grunts]

03:45.850 --> 03:47.977
-[cackles]
-[Claire pants]

03:48.228 --> 03:50.480
[Douxie whistling]

03:50.563 --> 03:51.898
[theme music playing]

04:19.717 --> 04:22.679
-I swear, Morgana's not dead!
-Rubbish.

04:22.762 --> 04:23.721
It's true, master.

04:23.805 --> 04:27.016
She saw her in the Shadow Realm,
which is great for saving history.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.727
But she's coming to attack
the kingdom any second!

04:29.811 --> 04:31.813
Which is less great.

04:31.896 --> 04:33.439
We are all in grave danger.

04:33.523 --> 04:36.985
And what were you doing
in the Shadow Realm, hmm?

04:37.068 --> 04:39.779
Its dark mirrors trick you,
sozzle your mind.

04:40.029 --> 04:43.241
Morgana is dead,
and no magic can change that.

04:43.324 --> 04:45.660
I haven't time to chase ghosts.

04:45.743 --> 04:47.537
We have more immediate threats.

04:47.620 --> 04:49.414
Morgana is a threat!

04:49.580 --> 04:50.790
Listen well, girl.

04:50.873 --> 04:52.500
Even if she had cheated death,

04:52.583 --> 04:56.379
we don't stand a chance if Gunmar attacks
before I finish the amulet.

04:56.462 --> 04:58.089
I've got everything, master.

04:58.172 --> 05:03.261
Amulet designs, alloys for the heart,
and my lute for some background music.

05:06.347 --> 05:09.058
-You're working on getting us back home?
-Of course.

05:09.142 --> 05:12.854
The heart is the only way
to get the lot of you out of my hair.

05:12.937 --> 05:15.565
-Not that he has much left. Ahem.
-I heard that.

05:15.648 --> 05:17.608
Master, Claire's onto something.

05:17.692 --> 05:20.653
I know you think
we're a bunch of dumb teens,

05:20.737 --> 05:22.864
but we have to defend Camelot
from disaster.

05:22.947 --> 05:23.781
Silence!

05:24.115 --> 05:25.366
Wizard got your tongues?

05:25.450 --> 05:30.413
If you truly believe the kingdom's
in danger, then go protect it... outside.

05:30.496 --> 05:32.498
I've an amulet to finish.

05:35.001 --> 05:37.378
-[sighs]
-[crowd cheering]

05:38.880 --> 05:43.009
Good people of Camelot,
we've suffered many hardships.

05:43.092 --> 05:45.845
Our enemies claim that I am broken.

05:45.928 --> 05:47.805
But I have overcome.

05:47.889 --> 05:51.601
Behold the light of Excalibur reborn!

05:53.019 --> 05:54.103
[muffled grunt]

05:54.771 --> 05:56.064
[coughing]

05:56.147 --> 05:58.941
-No sign of Morgana anywhere.
-[coughs]

05:59.025 --> 06:02.487
Nothing but unwashed plebeians
stuffing their faces, eh, Steve?

06:02.570 --> 06:04.072
[Steve] Oh, yeah!

06:04.489 --> 06:08.785
-A mighty leg for a mighty warrior!
-[camera shutter clicks]

06:09.243 --> 06:13.122
-Uh, do you take credit cards?
-The monsters at our door will fall.

06:13.206 --> 06:17.960
To ready our hearts for the battle ahead,
I host a private tournament.

06:18.044 --> 06:19.170
[cheering continues]

06:19.253 --> 06:21.923
-The winner shall stand at my side...
-[chuckles]

06:22.006 --> 06:27.095
...and have the honor of striking down
the monster, Bular the Butcher!

06:27.178 --> 06:28.471
[roars]

06:28.554 --> 06:29.472
[screams]

06:29.764 --> 06:32.266
-[roaring]
-[crowd screaming]

06:33.559 --> 06:36.229
[roars]

06:36.312 --> 06:40.316
Join Skullcrusher, or I crush skulls!

06:40.399 --> 06:42.110
-Whatever!
-[roaring continues]

06:42.568 --> 06:45.613
This is disastrous.
We cannot join Gunmar's army.

06:45.696 --> 06:50.034
-Murder's not my forte.
-Agreed, but we cannot die either.

06:50.451 --> 06:52.578
Let me talk to him. We go way back.

06:52.662 --> 06:54.705
-No, no!
-[Jim] Aaarrrgghh!

06:54.789 --> 06:59.252
I know under that rocky exterior
you're the kindest, most lovable--

06:59.502 --> 07:04.507
Look like Troll, smell like human. Impure!
[roars]

07:04.590 --> 07:07.051
Hey, hey, big fella, no need for violence.

07:07.927 --> 07:09.595
-[roars]
-[grunts]

07:09.679 --> 07:13.432
Join Skullcrusher, or I crush skulls!

07:13.516 --> 07:16.394
The brute certainly has
a limited vocabulary.

07:16.477 --> 07:18.271
He does get the message across.

07:18.438 --> 07:22.066
We're not joining Gunmar!
Not now, not ever!

07:22.150 --> 07:24.986
Yeah! I don't like the taste of people.
They're too stringy.

07:25.069 --> 07:27.488
Then die! [grunts]

07:27.613 --> 07:28.448
[Callista grunts]

07:29.031 --> 07:31.868
-[grunting]
-[roaring]

07:33.286 --> 07:35.413
Come on! Dwoza, stand up!

07:35.496 --> 07:37.790
Fight for what you believe in! Guys?

07:38.207 --> 07:40.209
Good luck or goodbye. Whichever!

07:40.293 --> 07:42.211
Looks like it's just us, Cal.

07:42.795 --> 07:45.756
[chuckles] See you on the other side, Jim.
[yells]

07:45.840 --> 07:47.091
[roars]

07:47.675 --> 07:50.595
-[swords clanging]
-[man] Swing harder! Come on!

07:50.970 --> 07:52.221
-[Oh!
-[chuckles]

07:54.223 --> 07:55.933
We know Arthur is the main target.

07:56.017 --> 07:58.311
I'll draw stasis traps
around the perimeter,

07:58.394 --> 07:59.687
put up defensive wards--

08:00.771 --> 08:03.941
[grunts] Mm.
[muffled] I forgot how good these tasted.

08:04.025 --> 08:07.320
-The ones in the future aren't the same.
-[groaning]

08:07.403 --> 08:09.780
Guys, this is Morgana we're talking about.

08:09.864 --> 08:12.617
We can't just wait for her
to slice our throats.

08:12.700 --> 08:14.202
-Why not?
-She'll find a way in.

08:14.285 --> 08:16.245
-[boy] Yeah!
-[screams]

08:16.662 --> 08:21.292
[boy] I, noble King Arthur,
will strike down the terrible Trolls!

08:21.375 --> 08:23.294
[girl] I will protect you, Troll!

08:23.377 --> 08:26.047
I am Morgana, the evil witch!

08:26.130 --> 08:27.715
Shadow bolt! Shadow bolt!

08:27.798 --> 08:31.052
[boy] You betray me, the noble king?

08:31.219 --> 08:33.638
-Die, sister! Die!
-That's enough!

08:33.804 --> 08:34.805
[crowd gasps]

08:37.475 --> 08:39.435
-[roars]
-[screaming]

08:39.519 --> 08:41.229
-[indistinct chatter]
-[clears throat]

08:41.312 --> 08:45.441
I crave a true battle.
Let the tournament continue.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.151
[crowd cheering]

08:47.235 --> 08:48.903
No sign of any sorceresses.

08:48.986 --> 08:51.572
Then again,
all you humans do look alike.

08:51.656 --> 08:53.115
She is crafty.

08:53.199 --> 08:55.409
She'll try to infiltrate the tournament.

08:55.826 --> 08:58.538
We have to go on the offensive,
root the witch out!

08:58.621 --> 09:00.248
You do that, we'll secure the castle.

09:00.331 --> 09:02.416
Douxie, wait! What about Steve?

09:02.500 --> 09:05.086
Time to invent the all-you-can-eat buffet.

09:05.169 --> 09:10.883
Many brave warriors
representing Camelot today, such as...

09:10.967 --> 09:13.010
squire Steve?

09:13.135 --> 09:15.471
Who the what?
I didn't put my name in the tournament!

09:15.555 --> 09:16.722
No, I did!

09:16.806 --> 09:19.517
Time you showed off all my training.

09:19.850 --> 09:22.103
[knight] I can't feel my legs!

09:22.728 --> 09:24.313
[exclaims] But I'm not a knight yet!

09:24.397 --> 09:27.024
I haven't grown a sick beard
or named my axe.

09:27.108 --> 09:29.819
Also, I'm supes full of turkey.
It's not going well in there.

09:29.902 --> 09:31.946
You'll fight under my banner.

09:32.029 --> 09:35.074
And as for a name-- Toothache, obviously.

09:35.157 --> 09:39.120
-Toothache... Oh, yeah!
-[chuckles]

09:39.579 --> 09:46.419
Facing off against the Rose Knight
is Steve of Palchukia!

09:46.502 --> 09:48.379
[cheering]

09:48.462 --> 09:50.381
That's right, plebes!

09:50.464 --> 09:53.884
[chuckles, clicks tongue]
The right choice! The only choice.

09:54.719 --> 09:58.347
Behold, the host with the most.

09:58.431 --> 09:59.974
The best in the west!

10:00.182 --> 10:05.229
The undisputed Spring Fling king!

10:05.313 --> 10:08.107
Combatants, prove thine honor. Begin!

10:08.190 --> 10:09.400
-[bell clangs]
-[yelling]

10:10.568 --> 10:13.029
-[screams, groans]
-[crowd gasps]

10:13.112 --> 10:15.281
-[Steve] I can't feel my legs. Oh, no.
-Yeah!

10:15.364 --> 10:18.618
Oh, no. Oh, no, no. Pepperjack?

10:19.535 --> 10:22.413
[groaning] Pepperjack?

10:22.496 --> 10:23.706
Pepperjack?

10:23.789 --> 10:26.167
[whimpers] Where's Pepperjack?

10:30.838 --> 10:31.839
Hmm.

10:36.969 --> 10:37.803
[man grunts]

10:38.220 --> 10:40.389
Just a few more defenses.

10:43.267 --> 10:47.104
Morgana's planning something
that no one would expect.

10:47.688 --> 10:49.523
[man groaning]

10:49.607 --> 10:53.277
You've forgotten to sharpen
my steel, squire.

10:53.361 --> 10:55.071
Where is your mind at?

10:55.446 --> 10:59.283
I must claim victory for my dark queen.

10:59.367 --> 11:01.744
Morgana's champion.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.749
-The Knight of Skulls is scary, ain't he?
-[gasps]

11:07.083 --> 11:09.126
-[grunts]
-[Galahad] Not sure where he's from.

11:09.210 --> 11:11.962
I hear he fights like a demon.

11:12.046 --> 11:13.589
Or for one.

11:17.051 --> 11:20.554
[guard] Only knights fighting
in the tournament are allowed past.

11:20.763 --> 11:22.890
Ugh. Boys' clubs.

11:23.641 --> 11:25.476
And there!

11:25.851 --> 11:29.271
The king's chambers and Merlin's tower,
completely warded.

11:29.355 --> 11:31.816
No evil sorceress
is getting in now, eh, Arch?

11:31.899 --> 11:34.026
Oh, you've done it, all right.
Overdone it.

11:34.110 --> 11:35.236
[gasps]

11:37.279 --> 11:39.156
-[yelps]
-Well, at least the castle's safe.

11:39.240 --> 11:40.866
Oy, the king summons you!

11:40.950 --> 11:42.243
-Come with me at once!
-What--

11:46.539 --> 11:47.540
[roaring]

11:51.335 --> 11:53.629
[grunting]

11:56.257 --> 11:57.883
Fight back!

11:57.967 --> 11:59.552
Can't. I'm a pacifist.

11:59.635 --> 12:00.803
Pathisist?

12:01.720 --> 12:03.806
[roars]

12:04.140 --> 12:06.559
What is pa-ci-fist?

12:06.642 --> 12:10.354
Someone who refuses
to participate in a war!

12:10.438 --> 12:13.691
-A peace-monger!
-A conscientious objector!

12:13.774 --> 12:16.777
-[groans] Thanks, Blink.
-[growls]

12:19.029 --> 12:21.615

12:25.744 --> 12:27.580
Keep him busy, kid! You got this!

12:27.663 --> 12:29.039
-What? Where are you go--
-[roars]

12:29.582 --> 12:33.210
Blinkous, you know
how we're both complete cowards?

12:33.294 --> 12:36.380
You more than me,
but that is an accurate statement, yes.

12:36.464 --> 12:38.841
Perhaps the Jim Troll Boy was right,

12:38.924 --> 12:42.761
and to do nothing is as bad
as doing the wrong something.

12:42.845 --> 12:44.346
Yep, got a point.

12:44.430 --> 12:46.432
Your words have moved me, brother.

12:46.724 --> 12:51.645
We seek to expel these invaders
for peace and harmony!

12:51.812 --> 12:55.149
Who will stand
with the pacifist alongside us?

12:55.232 --> 12:57.234
[cheering]

12:59.695 --> 13:02.323
-[all] Ooh!
-Whatever.

13:02.823 --> 13:04.241
-[growls]
-[both gasp]

13:05.201 --> 13:07.411
-[both scream]
-[Blinky] Never mind! Let us in!

13:07.495 --> 13:08.913
Wait, stop.

13:08.996 --> 13:12.208
-We'll stand by insi--
-[both scream]

13:12.291 --> 13:14.418
-[roars]
-[Callista grunts]

13:14.627 --> 13:16.587
-Heads up!
-[both scream]

13:16.670 --> 13:19.798
Drinks are on me. [grunts]

13:24.011 --> 13:25.221
[grunts]

13:26.555 --> 13:27.389
[grunts]

13:30.809 --> 13:32.394
[growls]

13:32.478 --> 13:35.147
Oh, not so tough now, are you? [chuckles]

13:35.856 --> 13:39.026
-Yes! Yes!
-[both laughing]

13:39.276 --> 13:41.529
Band of brothers, we did it!

13:41.612 --> 13:44.865
All of us, heroes of equal measure.

13:44.949 --> 13:46.825
-My idea all along.
-[laughing]

13:47.409 --> 13:51.497
-[all] Ooh!
-[growls]

13:51.622 --> 13:53.499
Glad to see you guys finally came around.

13:53.582 --> 13:55.417
[Bagdwella] Let's boil him!

13:55.501 --> 13:57.586
-[yelling]
-Die, Scum-Gumm!

13:57.670 --> 13:58.754
[Jim] Whoa! Stop!

13:58.837 --> 14:00.506
-You can't kill him!
-Why not?

14:00.589 --> 14:05.678
I know he just tried to break, like,
all my bones, but there's other ways.

14:05.761 --> 14:07.930
Well said. We'll torture him!

14:08.013 --> 14:09.765
-[cheering]
-No, pebble brains!

14:09.848 --> 14:13.352
He's saying, we don't have to be
like Gumm-Gumms.

14:13.519 --> 14:14.770
Huh?

14:15.020 --> 14:16.230
We can be better.

14:16.313 --> 14:20.693
Then what are we to do with him,
Mr. Moral Superiority?

14:20.776 --> 14:24.488
Perhaps, Blinkous,
since it was your idea to snare the brute,

14:24.572 --> 14:27.575
you should be in charge of his care.

14:27.658 --> 14:29.952
-[growls]
-Me? And that thing?

14:30.035 --> 14:32.329
Oh! Such an honor!

14:32.413 --> 14:34.832
Congratulations, brother.

14:34.915 --> 14:36.375
I hate you.

14:36.458 --> 14:38.419
Great, grumbly gruesome.

14:39.211 --> 14:44.174
[Galahad] We have reached the time
that's not the beginning,

14:44.258 --> 14:45.593
but not the end.

14:45.676 --> 14:48.095
A half-time, if you will.

14:48.178 --> 14:51.557
Enjoy this match of misfits, my lord!

14:51.640 --> 14:53.767
This is thoroughly degrading.

14:54.018 --> 14:57.855
[grunts, yells]

14:57.938 --> 14:59.857
Ugh, I thought the king was in danger,

14:59.940 --> 15:02.151
not looking to use my friend
as a sideshow.

15:02.234 --> 15:05.029
Perhaps we can arrive
at some sort of mutually beneficial-- Oh.

15:13.829 --> 15:16.040
-Mm.
-Why couldn't I have fought a gnome?

15:16.123 --> 15:18.292
I could've taken him. [belches]

15:18.375 --> 15:20.461
-Easy.
-Lift your spirits, lad.

15:20.544 --> 15:21.754
You'll have your moment.

15:21.837 --> 15:24.214
-[babbling]
-All right, that's enough.

15:24.298 --> 15:26.508
You have awoken the beast.

15:27.718 --> 15:28.677
[crowd cheering]

15:28.886 --> 15:31.347
Not bad for a winged pest.

15:31.430 --> 15:35.684
Now, the formidable Knight of Skulls
and his challenger,

15:35.768 --> 15:40.022
Sir "Clairee" of the House of Nuenz!

15:40.105 --> 15:41.565
What is she doing?

15:43.525 --> 15:46.403
[grunting]

15:56.789 --> 15:58.999
Hey! No fair, ref! Time out! Time out!

Sorcery? That is forbidden!

16:05.172 --> 16:06.757
Where is Morgana?

16:07.841 --> 16:09.760
What is a Morgana?

16:09.843 --> 16:13.430
-Your queen!
-Queen Sophia of the Dhar'k Isles?

16:13.514 --> 16:15.849
-[whimpers] Don't hurt me!
-But-- [screams]

16:16.934 --> 16:18.185
[crowd gasping]

16:18.352 --> 16:19.937
The witch is disqualified!

16:20.020 --> 16:22.606
You both fight with no honor!

16:22.815 --> 16:23.857
Begone!

16:24.525 --> 16:26.068
Hail Morgana!

16:26.694 --> 16:27.903
No!

16:36.495 --> 16:38.330

That's it! Charge!

Run free, Gumm-Gumm prince!

16:54.471 --> 16:57.266
[grunts] At last. [roars]

17:04.064 --> 17:06.025

17:13.866 --> 17:16.160
You'll die in Camelot, butcher!

-Yeah, but they won't last long.
-Oh, no! Douxie!

17:55.616 --> 17:57.034
-What?
-The other Douxie!

17:57.117 --> 17:59.036
With the man bun, in the tower?

17:59.119 --> 18:01.080
Oh, fuzz buckets!

18:04.708 --> 18:07.753
[in Morgana's voice] Nowhere to run now,
brother?

18:07.836 --> 18:10.506
Morgana? What is this horror?

18:10.714 --> 18:13.092
A taste of my newfound power.

18:13.300 --> 18:16.303
And now, it is your death.

18:16.386 --> 18:18.639
Someone needs to slay this foul demon.

18:18.722 --> 18:19.932
Fight by my side?

18:20.015 --> 18:22.726
Heck, yeah! Let's creep slay!

18:22.893 --> 18:24.103
[both] For Camelot!

18:24.186 --> 18:26.396

19:10.732 --> 19:12.276
Dworkstone?

Camelot's defenses are destroyed...

[groans] I think I'm gonna stay in here
a bit longer.

21:34.251 --> 21:36.920
We need allies in the war to come.

21:37.004 --> 21:41.216
Our enemies are many,
but how will we face them alone?

21:41.425 --> 21:44.344
I am a king with half an army.
