WEBVTT

00:03.670 --> 00:05.729
Attention, all.
Attention, all.

00:05.872 --> 00:06.839
It is with great pleasure

00:06.973 --> 00:08.372
I would like to announce
the recipient

00:08.508 --> 00:11.739
of this year's prestigious
GE Followship Award

00:11.878 --> 00:14.711
is none other
than our very own Liz Lemon.

00:16.416 --> 00:18.281
Wait. How could Liz
win a fellowship award?

00:18.418 --> 00:19.544
She doesn't like people.

00:19.686 --> 00:23.383
No, followship, presented
annually to the woman...

00:23.523 --> 00:26.617
sorry, person...
who best exemplifies a follower.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.091
I'm not a follower.

00:28.228 --> 00:29.286
It also comes with 10 grand.

00:29.429 --> 00:33.024
I accept this proudly on behalf
of followers everywhere.

00:33.166 --> 00:35.100
When I think
of the free-spirited Liz Lemon

00:35.235 --> 00:36.566
I met just one year ago,

00:36.703 --> 00:38.330
so resistant
to product integration,

00:38.471 --> 00:40.405
cross-promotion,
and adverlingus,

00:40.540 --> 00:42.906
it pleases me to see how well
she's learned to follow.

00:43.043 --> 00:45.568
Ugh, is this because
of that GE sketch?

00:45.712 --> 00:47.839
He has a microwave
for a head.

00:47.981 --> 00:50.279
But it's such
an excellent GE microwave.

00:50.417 --> 00:52.214
You said
I didn't have a choice.

00:52.352 --> 00:54.650
What are you gonna do with your
money? Put it into a 401?

00:54.788 --> 00:56.255
Yeah,
I got to get one of those.

00:56.389 --> 00:58.914
What? Where do you invest
your money, Liz?

00:59.059 --> 01:01.152
I have like 12 grand
in checking.

01:01.294 --> 01:03.262
Are you an immigrant?

01:05.364 --> 01:08.801
Miss Maroney, I can't believe
how fast you lost the weight.

01:08.935 --> 01:11.597
If I can't be Mo'Nique fat,
I have to be Teri Hatcher thin.

01:11.738 --> 01:13.933
Either way,
you're laughing.

01:15.041 --> 01:16.508
Oh! Oh, no!

01:16.643 --> 01:18.770
My uniform.
Sorry.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.311
Let me get that off.

01:20.447 --> 01:22.278
Turn around.

01:22.415 --> 01:25.145
It just needs
a little bit of water.

01:27.087 --> 01:28.213
Aah!

01:28.354 --> 01:30.845
Oh, God, it hurts!

01:32.000 --> 01:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:50.343 --> 01:51.674
You're honestly
telling me

01:51.811 --> 01:53.369
you don't know
who Rosemary Howard is?

01:53.513 --> 01:55.674
Is she one of the ladies
who tried to shoot Gerald Ford?

01:55.815 --> 01:58.545
No! She's the first
female writer for "Laugh-In. "

01:58.685 --> 02:02.177
She wrote all the political
stuff for "Donny and Marie. "

02:03.423 --> 02:05.550
I grew up idolizing
her comedy.

02:06.459 --> 02:07.551
<i>Pardon me.</i>

02:08.360 --> 02:09.419
<i>Pardon me.</i>

02:10.330 --> 02:11.024
<i>Pardon me.</i>

02:11.164 --> 02:12.096
<i>Pardon you?</i>

02:12.232 --> 02:14.860
<i>You were
already pardoned.</i>

02:16.469 --> 02:18.903
It's funny 'cause it's true.

02:19.839 --> 02:22.000
Hi. I don't want to sound
like a weirdo fan,

02:22.142 --> 02:24.610
but I am obsessed with
everything you have ever done.

02:24.744 --> 02:28.373
And I used to make my friends
act out your skits the next day.

02:28.515 --> 02:31.678
When I say my friends, I mean
my Fisher Price My Friend dolls

02:31.818 --> 02:34.753
because I didn't have
a lot of friends.

02:34.888 --> 02:36.549
Oh, boy.
Am I still talking?

02:36.689 --> 02:37.951
You're gonna kill me,
aren't you?

02:38.091 --> 02:40.116
No. That's...
That's great.

02:40.260 --> 02:42.319
Oh, you are great.
I...

02:42.462 --> 02:44.020
I grew up
wanting to be you.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.632
I grew up wanting to be
Samantha Stephens

02:46.766 --> 02:47.630
on "Bewitched. "

02:47.767 --> 02:49.234
The closest I got

02:49.369 --> 02:51.997
was being married to a gay guy
for two years.

02:52.739 --> 02:54.707
Well, thank you.
Um...

02:54.841 --> 02:56.274
You are my heroine.

02:56.409 --> 02:58.775
And by heroine,
I mean lady hero.

02:58.912 --> 03:01.142
I don't want to inject you
and listen to jazz.

03:01.281 --> 03:01.975
Good Lord.

03:02.115 --> 03:03.446
Are you hungry?

03:03.583 --> 03:04.345
Always.

03:04.484 --> 03:07.009
Well, I'm gonna let you
take me to lunch later

03:07.153 --> 03:08.643
and get all this out
of your system.

03:08.788 --> 03:10.085
That would be great.

03:10.223 --> 03:11.485
I would love that.

03:11.624 --> 03:14.252
But you're supposed to
take me hat shopping.

03:14.394 --> 03:16.123
Hey, Jack.

03:16.262 --> 03:17.559
Could you hold on
a second?

03:17.697 --> 03:20.097
If you desecrate something,
is that bad?

03:20.233 --> 03:21.461
Tracy,
what happened now?

03:21.601 --> 03:23.398
I doubt
if anybody noticed.

03:23.536 --> 03:28.997
<i>Who brought stars
and bright stars?</i>

03:29.142 --> 03:33.943
<i>To the party last night?</i>

03:34.080 --> 03:39.017
<i>For the rascals we fought?</i>

03:39.152 --> 03:41.279
Who ever knew there were
so many words?

03:41.421 --> 03:42.752
It was like a Mos Def CD.

03:42.889 --> 03:44.618
Tracy, it's all right.

03:44.757 --> 03:46.588
You're a star.
You can do whatever you want to.

03:46.726 --> 03:48.125
That's your job.

03:48.261 --> 03:49.853
It's our job
to make it go away.

03:49.996 --> 03:51.691
I love this country.

03:51.831 --> 03:53.264
You go forth
and be crazy.

03:53.399 --> 03:54.696
I think
I can manage that.

03:54.834 --> 03:56.131
You can do anything
you want to do,

03:56.269 --> 03:57.759
except no dogfighting,
okay?

03:57.904 --> 04:00.134
That seems to be the one thing
that's off-limits these days.

04:07.146 --> 04:08.613
What's on your mind,
Tray?

04:08.748 --> 04:11.182
You've been curiously quiet
for 20 minutes.

04:11.317 --> 04:13.046
We got to start
doing dogfights.

04:13.186 --> 04:14.653
Dogfighting?

04:14.787 --> 04:16.880
I know it's repulsive
and hideous.

04:17.023 --> 04:18.183
But it's the only thing

04:18.324 --> 04:20.588
Jack Donaghy told me
I cannot do.

04:20.726 --> 04:22.558
So I got to do it.
Understand?

04:22.695 --> 04:25.061
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

04:25.198 --> 04:26.859
Dogfighting
is the most disgusting,

04:27.000 --> 04:28.558
vile thing
a human being can do.

04:28.701 --> 04:30.225
You cannot do it!

04:30.370 --> 04:31.997
Dogfighting it is.

04:32.138 --> 04:33.264
Make it happen.

04:35.308 --> 04:39.039
Man, this is Phil Spector's
entourage all over again.

04:40.947 --> 04:43.313
And his foot lingered.

04:43.449 --> 04:45.576
Oh, that is such
an upsetting story.

04:45.718 --> 04:48.312
Oh, I'll never watch
"Happy Days" the same way again.

04:48.454 --> 04:50.149
But, you know,
I miss live TV.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.349
It's... It's like sex,
you know?

04:52.492 --> 04:56.258
It's almost better when
everything goes horribly wrong.

04:57.664 --> 05:01.600
Well, you know, we do hire guest
writers every now and then.

05:01.734 --> 05:04.168
I don't know if that's something
you would ever be interested in.

05:04.304 --> 05:05.430
That'd be great.

05:05.571 --> 05:08.062
God, I haven't been
in that building in so long.

05:08.207 --> 05:12.234
Does everyone still do blow
in Joe Garagiola's office?

05:12.378 --> 05:14.403
Which one is blow?
Is that cocaine?

05:16.783 --> 05:18.751
Hello.
Where's the head page?

05:28.194 --> 05:29.991
You may enter.

05:31.431 --> 05:33.592
You're a machine.

05:33.733 --> 05:35.667
No. I wish.

05:35.802 --> 05:39.738
This is a prop from the classic
NBC series "Super Computer. "

05:39.872 --> 05:42.898
1975 to 1975.

05:43.042 --> 05:45.101
Look, you obviously know
who I am.

05:45.244 --> 05:46.336
But what you don't know

05:46.479 --> 05:48.913
is that I accidentally damaged
Kenneth Parcell's page jacket.

05:49.048 --> 05:50.345
Shh.
Really?

05:50.483 --> 05:52.678
Mr. Perfect,
Mr. Jesus-Loves-Me Parcell

05:52.819 --> 05:54.309
finally messed up?

05:54.454 --> 05:55.819
Do you know how long
I've been waiting

05:55.955 --> 05:59.254
to transfer that thumb-head
to CNBC in Paramus, New Jersey?

05:59.392 --> 06:01.257
But you can't transfer someone
without a demerit.

06:01.394 --> 06:02.588
But now...
Oh, boy.

06:02.729 --> 06:04.253
Here's what we're
gonna do.

06:04.397 --> 06:07.127
You've probably
never seen breasts before,

06:07.266 --> 06:09.791
so I'm gonna lean over
this desk,

06:09.936 --> 06:12.496
and you're gonna give me
a new page jacket.

06:12.638 --> 06:15.072
Please, I breast-fed
till I was 11,

06:15.208 --> 06:17.802
so I've forgotten more
about a woman's chest

06:17.944 --> 06:18.911
than you'll ever know.

06:19.045 --> 06:21.013
But I'm on TV.

06:21.147 --> 06:22.842
I said good day.

06:22.982 --> 06:23.949
No, you didn't.

06:24.083 --> 06:25.880
Well, I meant to.

06:26.018 --> 06:27.815
Kenneth Parcell
is finished.

06:27.954 --> 06:30.752
Finished!

06:33.593 --> 06:36.790
All right, what's in the news
this week, everybody?

06:36.929 --> 06:37.827
Any ideas?

06:37.964 --> 06:39.056
I have an idea.

06:39.198 --> 06:41.598
We open on
a New Orleans abortion clinic.

06:41.734 --> 06:43.759
A beautiful mulatto...

06:43.903 --> 06:46.463
I don't think we're allowed
to use any of those words.

06:46.606 --> 06:49.006
Why not?
It's live television.

06:49.142 --> 06:52.373
I mean, we used to say
And

06:52.512 --> 06:54.207
No, you didn't.

06:54.347 --> 06:56.645
Did you? We did. We pushed the envelope.

06:56.783 --> 07:01.413
Remember the mailbox sketch
that shocked America?

07:01.554 --> 07:04.045
There's nothing wrong here.

07:08.394 --> 07:12.660
Don't you get it?
The mailbox was Haldeman.

07:12.799 --> 07:15.495
Is... Is that a person
who lived?

07:16.469 --> 07:17.493
What about race?

07:17.637 --> 07:20.401
I mean, I say that
is the last taboo.

07:20.540 --> 07:23.008
We get Josh
in blackface, right?

07:23.142 --> 07:26.373
And then we get Tracy
to call him a

07:27.814 --> 07:29.145
I'd watch that.
- No, no, no.

07:29.282 --> 07:31.250
Uh, you can't do race stuff
on TV.

07:31.384 --> 07:32.351
It's too sensitive.

07:32.485 --> 07:36.216
We would have done that
on "The Mandrell Sisters. "

07:36.355 --> 07:38.289
I- I want the show
to be edgy, too.

07:38.424 --> 07:40.392
I mean, but my boss,
Jack Donaghy...

07:40.526 --> 07:42.494
Let me talk to him.
I am great with suits.

07:42.628 --> 07:45.426
No, no, no.
We... We don't talk to him.

07:45.565 --> 07:46.497
We don't do that.
Liz!

07:46.632 --> 07:48.827
You're not a cog
in their machine.

07:48.968 --> 07:49.935
I know.

07:50.069 --> 07:52.936
I'm not some... follower.

07:53.072 --> 07:57.031
I just... We are very subversive
on this show.

07:57.176 --> 07:59.007
Frank, what do you have
this week?

07:59.145 --> 08:00.442
Barry the Humping Dog

08:00.580 --> 08:02.844
is shopping for a GE washer
and dryer.

08:02.982 --> 08:04.609
I have not
seen that before.

08:09.222 --> 08:10.883
Yo, I got the dogs
outside.

08:11.023 --> 08:11.955
Well, bring them in.

08:12.091 --> 08:14.958
I feel sick to my stomach
about dogfighting,

08:15.094 --> 08:17.528
but what can you do
when they tell you not to?

08:17.663 --> 08:19.426
This could get ugly.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.365
What?

08:22.502 --> 08:23.764
No!

08:23.903 --> 08:25.370
You idiots!

08:25.505 --> 08:28.133
I built a dogfighting pit
in my basement for this?

08:28.274 --> 08:31.471
Tracy, can I speak with you
privately?

08:37.549 --> 08:41.645
Tray, what's the one thing
I asked you not to do?

08:41.787 --> 08:44.654
That "227" movie,
"New Jackée City"?

08:44.790 --> 08:45.654
Dogfighting.

08:45.791 --> 08:47.725
What is it
about your wiring

08:47.860 --> 08:51.023
that compels you to do exactly
what you're asked not to?

08:51.163 --> 08:53.791
I don't know.
I've always been this way.

08:54.634 --> 08:56.829
Tracy, don't play with matches.

08:56.969 --> 08:57.993
You're not my dad!

08:58.137 --> 09:00.469
Tracy, don't stare directly at
the sun. It'll make you crazy.

09:00.606 --> 09:01.766
You're not my dad!

09:01.908 --> 09:04.342
Tracy, you're not going out
of the house dressed like that!

09:04.477 --> 09:05.535
You're not my dad!

09:06.379 --> 09:08.813
I'm beginning to think this has
something to do with your dad.

09:08.948 --> 09:10.108
You're not my dad!

09:10.249 --> 09:12.240
You can't tell me
what it's about!

09:15.721 --> 09:18.519
Hey, props gave me a bunch of
dog penises for you to look at.

09:18.658 --> 09:20.649
Oh, great.
Thanks.

09:20.793 --> 09:23.762
Liz, your grandmother
is in Jack's office.

09:23.896 --> 09:27.093
You better do something.
Nana Lemon? That's weird.

09:27.233 --> 09:29.360
Oh. Oh, no.
Rosemary.

09:29.502 --> 09:31.834
Oh.

09:34.840 --> 09:36.535
Lemon, Rosemary here
was just telling me

09:36.676 --> 09:38.371
some of her
fantastic sketch ideas.

09:38.511 --> 09:40.138
Liz, he totally gets it.

09:40.279 --> 09:41.837
He understands
that what we do

09:41.981 --> 09:43.812
is far more important
than what they do.

09:43.950 --> 09:45.349
I do.
I really do get it.

09:45.484 --> 09:47.281
Rosemary,
thank you so very much.

09:47.420 --> 09:48.546
My pleasure.
What a pleasure.

09:48.688 --> 09:50.212
What fun
catching up with you.

09:50.356 --> 09:51.050
You too.

09:51.190 --> 09:53.488
You take care, now.
You too.

09:54.927 --> 09:56.292
Fire her.

09:56.429 --> 09:59.398
And don't ever make me talk
to a woman that old again.

09:59.532 --> 10:01.022
I can't fire Rosemary.

10:01.167 --> 10:02.634
Yes, you can.
It's easy.

10:02.768 --> 10:04.235
Observe.

10:04.370 --> 10:05.462
Jonathan,
you're fired.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.800
What?! No!
Oh, God, no!

10:07.940 --> 10:10.670
<i>No. I won't fire her.
It's mean.</i>

10:10.810 --> 10:12.175
And I like her.

10:12.311 --> 10:14.541
And she's right... We should
be pushing the envelope.

10:14.680 --> 10:16.443
Oh, God.
"Push the envelope. "

10:16.582 --> 10:17.947
You know who uses
that phrase?

10:18.084 --> 10:20.018
People who don't have the guts
or the brains

10:20.152 --> 10:21.585
to work
inside the system...

10:21.721 --> 10:24.713
letter writers, radicals,
Howard Dean.

10:24.857 --> 10:25.846
You just don't get her.

10:25.992 --> 10:27.516
You're like
the talking mailbox.

10:27.660 --> 10:29.457
I'm going to assume that's
a Haldeman reference,

10:29.595 --> 10:30.926
in which case,
I thank you.

10:31.063 --> 10:33.429
I got into this business
to be like Rosemary,

10:33.566 --> 10:34.828
to make people think.

10:34.967 --> 10:36.195
No.
No, no, no, Lemon.

10:36.335 --> 10:37.859
You got into this business
because you're funny

10:38.004 --> 10:40.438
and you're weird
and you're socially retarded.

10:40.573 --> 10:42.370
And you also got into it
because it pays well,

10:42.508 --> 10:43.975
which means you are not
like Rosemary.

10:44.110 --> 10:45.077
You are like me.

10:45.211 --> 10:46.769
No, I'm not.
You are a suit.

10:46.912 --> 10:49.574
You feed off the creativity
and hard work of other people

10:49.715 --> 10:53.845
and turn it into commercials and
pie charts and triangle graphs!

10:53.986 --> 10:55.180
What's a triangle graph?

10:55.321 --> 10:56.982
I don't know.
It sounded real.

10:57.890 --> 10:58.914
This is my show.

10:59.058 --> 11:00.389
No, this is my show,

11:00.526 --> 11:02.391
and once a week, I rent it out
to the good people

11:02.528 --> 11:04.052
at the erectile-dysfunction
companies.

11:04.196 --> 11:06.391
Be that as it may,
Rosemary is my idol.

11:06.532 --> 11:09.262
And if you want to get rid of
her, then you will fire me also.

11:11.270 --> 11:13.704
I'm gonna have to kill myself.
Suck it up, nerd.

11:15.741 --> 11:17.402
Oh, my God, Rosemary.

11:17.543 --> 11:19.602
That was such a rush,
standing up to Jack like that.

11:19.745 --> 11:21.736
And I never would have done it
if it weren't for you.

11:21.881 --> 11:23.473
I am so proud of you.

11:23.616 --> 11:24.640
He heard you roar,

11:24.784 --> 11:26.809
and now things are gonna change
around here.

11:26.952 --> 11:28.647
Jack says
you're both fired.

11:32.024 --> 11:32.991
Yes!

11:35.261 --> 11:37.024
Hey, Tray.

11:37.163 --> 11:38.187
What you doing?

11:38.330 --> 11:39.524
Just some heavy thinking.

11:39.665 --> 11:41.633
This spotlight is the only place
that I can go

11:41.767 --> 11:43.132
to get away from it all.

11:43.269 --> 11:46.534
You know, Tray,
I get this dad thing.

11:46.672 --> 11:48.105
I mean,
my father belongs

11:48.240 --> 11:50.538
in the Smiling Irish Bastard
Hall of Fame,

11:50.676 --> 11:53.702
and the pent-up, unresolved
anger I have toward him,

11:53.846 --> 11:55.541
it still overwhelms me.

11:55.681 --> 11:57.080
You've got to learn
to forgive.

11:57.216 --> 11:59.480
How do I forgive someone
that I don't know?

11:59.618 --> 12:02.985
Boy, if I could just talk
to him once, just once.

12:03.122 --> 12:04.555
Tracy, we're gonna
do this together.

12:04.690 --> 12:06.385
You've got to
get into therapy.

12:06.525 --> 12:08.925
I don't need therapy.
I'm just mentally ill.

12:09.061 --> 12:11.894
Tracy, what if I told you that
the one thing you cannot do

12:12.031 --> 12:13.055
is therapy?

12:13.199 --> 12:14.632
You're not my dad!

12:14.767 --> 12:16.962
We're doing therapy!

12:19.305 --> 12:20.932
All right, thank you.
Goodbye.

12:21.073 --> 12:21.835
Kenneth...

12:21.974 --> 12:23.839
I may have
made a mistake.

12:23.976 --> 12:25.876
I was talking to Donnie.
Donnie?

12:26.011 --> 12:29.003
Head page Donnie Lawson?
The King of Sting?

12:29.148 --> 12:30.080
What did you do?

12:30.216 --> 12:31.945
I was just trying
to make things right.

12:32.084 --> 12:33.779
Nice jacket, Parcell.

12:33.919 --> 12:36.717
I hope that it and you
will be very unhappy

12:36.856 --> 12:38.949
at CNBC
for the next year.

12:39.091 --> 12:41.025
Of course,
there is one other choice.

12:41.160 --> 12:42.457
A page-off!

12:45.064 --> 12:46.531
A page-off?
What's that?

12:46.665 --> 12:48.030
It's a savage contest

12:48.167 --> 12:51.034
mixing physical stamina
with NBC trivia.

12:51.170 --> 12:52.637
"What's a page-off?"

12:52.772 --> 12:54.865
Your monkey's
pretty stupid.

12:55.007 --> 12:57.874
You want a page-off,
you got it, freak!

12:58.010 --> 13:00.103
Winner take all!

13:05.518 --> 13:07.816
I don't know what corporate
mind games he's playing,

13:07.953 --> 13:09.682
but if Jack thinks
I'm crawling back there...

13:09.822 --> 13:10.789
Oh, screw him!

13:10.923 --> 13:13.323
Now that you're free, we can
work on something together.

13:13.459 --> 13:17.327
Yeah! We can start our own
network called Bitch TV.

13:17.463 --> 13:19.829
Or the second idea
that we think of.

13:19.965 --> 13:21.694
Look, when we get back
to my place,

13:21.834 --> 13:23.199
we'll start banging out
some ideas.

13:23.335 --> 13:25.963
Welcome to the first day
of the rest of your life.

13:26.105 --> 13:27.800
What neighborhood
is this?

13:27.940 --> 13:29.373
They call it
Little Chechnya.

13:29.508 --> 13:31.533
It's so gritty and real.

13:31.677 --> 13:33.645
More murders per capita
than Detroit.

13:33.779 --> 13:36.771
<i>Try not to write
when you're living here.</i>

13:36.916 --> 13:38.850
Is that guy
carrying a gun?

13:38.984 --> 13:41.145
Yeah, but don't worry.
He's not a cop.

13:41.287 --> 13:42.652
Oh...

13:44.023 --> 13:45.217
Um, hey, Tracy,

13:45.357 --> 13:47.621
this is Suzanne Hocker,
the NBC therapist.

13:47.760 --> 13:49.660
Who's crazier?
Me or Ann Curry?

13:49.795 --> 13:50.727
Hello, Tracy.

13:50.863 --> 13:52.728
Jack informed me of the talk
you had earlier,

13:52.865 --> 13:53.729
and if you don't mind,

13:53.866 --> 13:56.096
I'd like to hop right in
and start with some role play.

13:56.235 --> 13:57.202
Like my wife and I do?

13:57.336 --> 14:00.203
Cool. You be the maid.
I want you to scream.

14:00.339 --> 14:01.966
Donaghy,
you play the matador.

14:02.107 --> 14:04.541
Uh, no, Tracy,
what I want you to do

14:04.677 --> 14:06.474
is talk
to that empty chair

14:06.612 --> 14:09.172
as if your father
were sitting there, okay?

14:11.050 --> 14:12.347
This is stupid.

14:12.484 --> 14:14.281
Come on, Tracy.
We're here to help you.

14:14.420 --> 14:17.412
Uh, Tracy, maybe it will help
if Jack sits in the chair

14:17.556 --> 14:19.421
and pretends
to be your father.

14:23.329 --> 14:24.660
I want to talk
to you, son.

14:24.797 --> 14:26.526
You sound nothing
like my dad.

14:26.665 --> 14:27.654
Well, where's he from?

14:27.800 --> 14:29.791
All I know is he's
from funky North Philly.

14:29.935 --> 14:31.698
He worked in
a Campbell's Soup factory,

14:31.837 --> 14:34.362
and he had a droopy lip
due to an unattended root canal.

14:34.506 --> 14:36.633
I think I can do this.
Okay.

14:36.775 --> 14:37.571
Go.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.405
I'm mad at you, Dad.

14:39.545 --> 14:41.638
Hey, dummy, I'm mad at you, too.

14:41.780 --> 14:43.213
Why you got to act out
that way?

14:43.349 --> 14:44.543
Uh, that's not exactly
what I...

14:44.683 --> 14:46.310
'Cause you left me, Dad.

14:46.452 --> 14:47.783
I was young and confused,

14:47.920 --> 14:49.888
and your moms
didn't want me around no more.

14:50.022 --> 14:51.751
Now, pass me
them damn collared greens.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.791
Is that true, Mom?

14:56.495 --> 14:58.520
He gambled
away my welfare check.

14:58.664 --> 15:00.393
Woman, I got a mind

15:00.532 --> 15:01.863
to smack you
upside the head!

15:02.001 --> 15:03.093
Uh, this is not helpful.

15:03.235 --> 15:04.793
Be me now.

15:06.372 --> 15:09.205
I only act
out because I want your love.

15:09.341 --> 15:10.706
Dy-no-mite!

15:10.843 --> 15:12.743
I think we're just doing
"Good Times" now.

15:12.878 --> 15:15.176
Now do the white dude
that my moms left my dad for.

15:15.314 --> 15:17.248
Now, see here, Tracy,

15:17.383 --> 15:19.544
it's impolite
to slurp one's soup.

15:19.685 --> 15:22.279
Whoa, no need to resort
to ugly stereotypes.

15:22.421 --> 15:23.911
You're always gonna be my son.

15:24.056 --> 15:26.286
Just because
I stopped loving your dad

15:26.425 --> 15:27.756
doesn't mean
we stopped loving you.

15:27.893 --> 15:29.417
Stop putting
words in my mouth, woman!

15:29.561 --> 15:32.189
Oye, papi.
Càllate. People are sleeping!

15:32.331 --> 15:34.458
Mind your
own business, Mrs. Rodriguez!

15:34.600 --> 15:35.965
All right,
this is ridiculous.

15:36.101 --> 15:38.968
Lady, just because
I'm an ignorant black man

15:39.104 --> 15:41.572
and you paid me a nickel
to bust up your chifforobe

15:41.707 --> 15:43.732
doesn't give you the right
to call me ridiculous

15:43.876 --> 15:46.140
just 'cause I'm proud
of my son.

15:48.047 --> 15:49.446
They got me!

15:49.581 --> 15:51.879
The honkies shot me!

15:52.017 --> 15:53.746
No, Dad!

15:53.886 --> 15:55.080
Don't die!

15:55.220 --> 15:57.017
I love you, Dad!

15:57.156 --> 15:58.987
I don't want to dogfight
no more!

15:59.124 --> 16:02.059
Tracy, that's it! That's it!

16:02.194 --> 16:03.923
Thank you for showing me
there really is love

16:04.063 --> 16:06.088
in my family after all.

16:06.231 --> 16:08.722
And I need to stay
the hell away from them.

16:08.867 --> 16:11.961
Donaghy, you're the only family
I need, Jackie D.

16:12.104 --> 16:13.867
You got that right,
Tray.

16:14.006 --> 16:16.167
You know, it's too bad
you didn't know Howard Cosell

16:16.308 --> 16:19.038
when you were growing up, 'cause
I had that one in my pocket.

16:23.415 --> 16:24.643
There we are.

16:27.019 --> 16:28.884
Oh, crap-balls!
What was that?

16:31.190 --> 16:32.748
Okay, let's find a pen

16:32.891 --> 16:35.689
and start
that screenplay.

16:35.828 --> 16:38.592
This movie is gonna knock them
on their asses.

16:38.731 --> 16:40.961
Right.
Uh, what's it about?

16:41.100 --> 16:43.625
Women in their 50s
join the Army

16:43.769 --> 16:47.205
and get laid by a bunch
of grateful 18-year-olds.

16:47.339 --> 16:48.431
Oh, God.

16:48.574 --> 16:50.166
Yeah. Exactly.

16:50.309 --> 16:53.540
I predict opening weekend,
a million dollars.

16:53.679 --> 16:56.045
Have you been drinking wine
all day?

16:56.181 --> 16:57.307
Oh, it's heart healthy.

16:57.449 --> 16:58.711
All day?

16:58.851 --> 17:01.752
Oh, come on, Liz.
It's the '90s!

17:04.990 --> 17:07.982
Did an "F" train
just go by your window?

17:08.127 --> 17:09.685
I know that look.

17:09.828 --> 17:12.797
Don't even think about jumping
for that train.

17:12.931 --> 17:15.525
I think I should... I should
go home before it gets dark.

17:15.666 --> 17:18.032
You can't abandon me, Liz.

17:18.170 --> 17:20.569
You are me!
No, I'm not you.

17:20.705 --> 17:23.607
Really? You pick up guys
that are smart and funny,

17:23.742 --> 17:26.074
and they leave you
for someone less complicated.

17:26.211 --> 17:29.203
You're never gonna
get married, Liz.

17:29.348 --> 17:30.975
You're married
to your job.

17:31.116 --> 17:33.414
Oh, my God,
I lost my job.

17:33.552 --> 17:34.849
You're just like me.

17:34.987 --> 17:36.978
You get up in the morning
and smoke weed.

17:37.122 --> 17:37.986
No, I don't!

17:38.123 --> 17:41.183
You obsess about the Jamaican
man across the hall.

17:41.326 --> 17:43.226
Oh, my God,
I lost my job.

17:43.362 --> 17:45.728
You wouldn't have a job
if it wasn't for me.

17:45.864 --> 17:47.559
I broke barriers
for you.

17:47.699 --> 17:49.030
I really have to go.

17:49.168 --> 17:53.366
I sat around while my junk
went bad, all for you.

17:53.505 --> 17:55.564
I didn't have any kids.

17:55.707 --> 17:57.971
You're my kid!

17:58.110 --> 18:00.271
You're my kid
that never calls!

18:00.412 --> 18:01.344
Yikes.

18:01.480 --> 18:03.038
Help me, Liz Lemon!

18:03.182 --> 18:05.912
You're my only hope!

18:06.885 --> 18:09.945
Okay, Which NBC series spun off,
among others,

18:10.089 --> 18:13.650
"Cosby," "Miami Vice," "Cheers,"
and "Highway to Heaven"?

18:13.792 --> 18:14.724
"Super Computer. "

18:14.860 --> 18:16.327
Oh, you're gonna do great.

18:16.462 --> 18:18.157
Ready.

18:29.208 --> 18:31.438
Come on, Kenneth.
You can do it.

18:34.880 --> 18:36.279
Hey!

18:36.415 --> 18:39.077
What the hell is going on
down here?

18:39.218 --> 18:40.617
The phones are ringing
off the hook.

18:40.752 --> 18:42.344
There's no one seating
the "Conan" audience.

18:42.488 --> 18:44.581
Get back to work,
you morons!

18:45.791 --> 18:47.816
Pete, wait.
You don't understand.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.087
I ruined Kenneth's jacket,
and he needs to get a new one

18:50.229 --> 18:52.390
but can't have any demerits,
so we had to have a page-off.

18:52.531 --> 18:54.260
What? Are you kidding me?

18:54.399 --> 18:56.424
This is
a billion-dollar company.

18:56.568 --> 18:58.001
Demerits?

18:58.137 --> 19:01.368
Donnie, give Kenneth
a damn jacket!

19:04.910 --> 19:07.811
This isn't over between us,
Maroney.

19:07.946 --> 19:09.277
You're in it now!

19:12.284 --> 19:14.844
Well, it's finally over,
Ms. Maroney.

19:14.987 --> 19:15.851
Yes.

19:15.988 --> 19:19.116
And it's hard to even remember
how it all began.

19:23.695 --> 19:25.754
You burnt my jacket.

19:27.299 --> 19:29.927
All right, I need my job back,
but this is not crawling.

19:30.068 --> 19:31.092
This is proud begging,

19:31.236 --> 19:33.136
like those kids that dance
on the subway.

19:33.272 --> 19:35.035
Of course you can have
your job back, Lemon.

19:35.174 --> 19:37.074
Oh, thank God.
It was terrible.

19:37.209 --> 19:40.372
I went to her apartment.
I don't think she has a toilet.

19:40.512 --> 19:41.979
I saw my future, Jack.

19:42.114 --> 19:44.344
Never go with a hippie
to a second location.

19:45.784 --> 19:47.217
I can't end up like that.

19:47.352 --> 19:49.343
I have got to make money
and save it.

19:49.488 --> 19:51.854
And I have to do that thing
that rich people do

19:51.990 --> 19:54.151
where they turn money
into more money.

19:54.293 --> 19:55.726
Can you teach me
how to do that?

19:55.861 --> 19:57.089
With my eyes closed.

19:57.229 --> 20:01.598
Oh. Good, because I want to send
Rosemary $400 a month for...

20:01.733 --> 20:02.722
forever.

20:02.868 --> 20:04.529
You should.
That woman is unemployable.

20:04.670 --> 20:07.605
Rosemary says that women become
obsolete in this business

20:07.739 --> 20:09.969
when there's no one left
that wants to see them naked.

20:10.108 --> 20:12.542
You make enough money, you can
pay people to look at you naked.

20:12.678 --> 20:14.441
To the future, Lemon.

20:15.280 --> 20:16.747
Oh, and, by the way,

20:16.882 --> 20:20.147
GE has a problem
with the dog-penis sketch.

20:23.822 --> 20:25.289
I'll change it.

20:28.227 --> 20:30.457
Hey, what about
cat penises?

20:31.305 --> 20:37.180
