00:00.046 --> 00:01.960
<i>Previously, on</i>
"Andi Mack"...

00:01.991 --> 00:03.050
You have panic attacks?

00:03.136 --> 00:04.663
- Since when?
- The first time

00:04.749 --> 00:06.051
at your Bar Mitzvah.

00:06.450 --> 00:08.718
<i>I was the most scared
I've ever been in my life.</i>

00:08.965 --> 00:09.965
We're friends.

00:10.795 --> 00:11.960
Virtual couple?

00:12.046 --> 00:15.006
Sounds more like
virtual nothing.

00:15.999 --> 00:17.260
Can we please meet up?

00:17.345 --> 00:18.554
Sure.

00:19.179 --> 00:20.366
We can do that.

00:20.452 --> 00:22.390
- Mom.
- I have come to take you

00:22.476 --> 00:23.757
cake tasting,
for the wedding.

00:23.843 --> 00:26.129
I don't want to get sucked
into a decision-making vortex

00:26.215 --> 00:28.398
for a super-fancy party
that only you want.

00:28.484 --> 00:30.616
I was only asking you
to be polite.

00:30.916 --> 00:32.069
Andi!

00:32.155 --> 00:33.468
- That one.
- That one.

00:34.659 --> 00:37.523
This might be where
our relationship ends.

00:42.176 --> 00:45.049
Now, I know neither one of us
are big on compromise.

00:45.135 --> 00:47.499
Just for the record,
I was right about the cake.

00:47.648 --> 00:49.210
And I was right
about the dress.

00:49.351 --> 00:51.590
And one of us
doesn't appreciate gloating.

00:51.734 --> 00:54.609
Too bad, because one of us
is really good at it.

00:55.876 --> 00:58.507
Also good at knowing when to stop.
Please continue.

00:58.710 --> 01:01.300
Remember that Bex wants
to keep it simple.

01:01.385 --> 01:03.627
So for the color story,
I was thinking

01:03.713 --> 01:06.668
ecru, eggshell, linen.

01:06.754 --> 01:08.004
What do you think?

01:10.135 --> 01:11.510
Crazy idea

01:11.776 --> 01:13.846
but what if
for the color story,

01:13.932 --> 01:15.776
we included a color?

01:15.877 --> 01:16.960
These are colors.

01:17.045 --> 01:19.737
Sure. But so is...

01:21.598 --> 01:22.803
green.

01:23.209 --> 01:24.705
Celadon.

01:25.045 --> 01:26.198
Do you like it?

01:26.323 --> 01:28.221
I do, actually.

01:28.307 --> 01:29.807
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:29.911 --> 01:32.596
Ecru out! Celadon in!

01:33.073 --> 01:34.420
Wow, that was easy.

01:34.505 --> 01:36.745
- What's next?
- Flowers.

01:36.893 --> 01:38.768
Oh, I already know
what I want.

01:38.854 --> 01:39.909
Me too.

01:39.995 --> 01:43.034
Well, I feel very strongly
about this one.

01:43.142 --> 01:45.564
- We've got to go with hydrangeas.
- It has to be hydrangeas.

01:45.963 --> 01:47.494
I thought this would be
much harder.

01:47.580 --> 01:49.130
I thought this
would be impossible.

01:49.215 --> 01:50.963
All right. Moving on
to centerpieces then.

01:51.049 --> 01:52.682
Oh! I got this.

01:52.846 --> 01:54.737
I'm making them.

01:55.002 --> 01:57.291
- You're making them?
- Yeah.

01:57.377 --> 01:59.987
Remember the lamp I made
out of Bex's old CDs?

02:00.127 --> 02:01.210
Uh-huh.

02:01.352 --> 02:03.347
Well, I'm making one
for every table,

02:03.433 --> 02:05.058
and then we'll get those
little battery packs

02:05.143 --> 02:06.505
so they're all lit up.

02:08.856 --> 02:11.229
Unlike the expression
on your face right now.

02:11.315 --> 02:13.932
Oh, you weren't
supposed to see that.

02:14.323 --> 02:15.590
Obviously, you hate it.

02:15.675 --> 02:17.588
I don't hate it.

02:17.748 --> 02:21.690
I just don't want a bunch
of 90s grunge CDs glued together

02:21.776 --> 02:24.323
to be the centerpieces
of my daughter's wedding!

02:25.005 --> 02:27.085
I was thinking orchids.

02:28.856 --> 02:31.096
All those in favor of orchids,
raise your hand.

02:31.825 --> 02:33.143

The mirrors are covered.

04:20.964 --> 04:22.460
Hey, why can't we
look at ourselves?

04:22.652 --> 04:24.457
It's only for
a couple hours.

04:24.715 --> 04:26.191
You can make it, buddy.

04:27.371 --> 04:29.160
Hey, guys,
thanks for coming.

04:29.300 --> 04:31.675
I'm so sorry about
your Bubbe Rose.

04:31.878 --> 04:34.105
She was so sweet.

04:35.252 --> 04:37.996
Remember how she tried
to teach us Yiddish?

04:38.168 --> 04:40.470
<i>Oy gevalt</i>,
who could forget?

04:40.556 --> 04:43.011
You vant a nosh?
Have a shmear.

04:43.730 --> 04:45.210
I wish I could
have met her.

04:45.355 --> 04:48.050
Hey, where is she?
I want to pay my respects.

04:48.135 --> 04:52.550
Um, well, we just buried her,
so she's probably not coming.

04:52.707 --> 04:54.340
She's not
laid out somewhere?

04:54.550 --> 04:55.707
This is a shiva.

04:55.793 --> 04:57.160
The only thing
that gets laid out

04:57.246 --> 04:58.558
are the deli platters.

04:58.707 --> 05:00.960
Shiva is about friends
and family being together

05:01.045 --> 05:03.710
to comfort one another
and share stories.

05:03.795 --> 05:05.839
That sounds like
a really nice thing to do

05:05.925 --> 05:07.238
when you've just
lost someone.

05:07.324 --> 05:08.715
It is.

05:09.222 --> 05:11.500
Except it lasts seven days.

05:11.738 --> 05:13.996
We take a long time
to say goodbye.

05:25.800 --> 05:27.019
Hi, I'm Bowie.

05:27.105 --> 05:29.246
I know.
We met at the Bar Mitzvah.

05:29.332 --> 05:30.418
Where's Bex?

05:30.519 --> 05:31.550
Oh, she's at work.

05:31.636 --> 05:33.004
She'll come by later.

05:33.175 --> 05:34.433
I'm sorry for your loss.

05:34.519 --> 05:37.511
Thank you.
We all loved her very much.

05:37.597 --> 05:39.960
I read that people
bring food to a shiva,

05:40.045 --> 05:42.715
so... I made a koo-gel.

05:43.784 --> 05:45.722
Uh, kuggle?

05:46.730 --> 05:49.004
Kah-jel?

05:49.472 --> 05:51.582
This. I, I made you this.

05:51.691 --> 05:53.668
It's pronounced kugel.

05:53.754 --> 05:55.300
And you shouldn't have.

05:55.386 --> 05:56.871
You really shouldn't have.

05:56.957 --> 05:59.433
- Where should I put it?
- Oh, I'll take it.

05:59.535 --> 06:01.558
Can I ask you a favor?

06:01.644 --> 06:02.629
Sure.

06:02.715 --> 06:05.871
Would you mind entertaining
Rose's Mahjong buddies?

06:05.972 --> 06:07.277
Right now,
they're placing odds

06:07.425 --> 06:09.988
on who in the room
is gonna die next.

06:10.136 --> 06:12.050
Uh, sounds fun.

06:12.160 --> 06:14.777
If you prefer, there's
another a group over there

06:14.863 --> 06:17.402
playing
"You Should Get That Looked At."

06:18.269 --> 06:19.918
I'll leave it up to you.

06:22.371 --> 06:24.425
Hey, ladies!

06:40.699 --> 06:42.619
This is sitting shiva?

06:43.463 --> 06:44.832
Apparently.

06:47.777 --> 06:50.746
Literally...
just sitting?

06:55.892 --> 06:57.262
Sorry.

06:59.816 --> 07:01.356
Excuse me.

07:02.331 --> 07:03.605
Me too!

07:06.940 --> 07:10.097
Wow, somebody really wants
to get in touch with you.

07:10.349 --> 07:11.564
Yeah.

07:11.660 --> 07:12.925
Who?

07:13.922 --> 07:15.422
One second.

07:18.394 --> 07:20.675
- Sorry, what?
- Who was that?

07:22.135 --> 07:23.441
Who is that?

07:23.527 --> 07:24.707
Nobody!

07:24.877 --> 07:26.082
Is it Walker?

07:26.254 --> 07:27.355
No.

07:27.441 --> 07:28.605
It's okay if it is.

07:28.691 --> 07:30.558
I just said that it isn't.

07:32.509 --> 07:33.902
I'll be right back.

07:40.005 --> 07:42.519
That is when she was crowned
Miss Rockaway Beach.

07:42.605 --> 07:43.894
- Nice.
- Third runner up.

07:43.980 --> 07:46.332
- Third place is good.
- It's actually fourth place.

07:46.418 --> 07:47.988
It goes winner,
first runner-up,

07:48.074 --> 07:49.130
second runner-up,
third runner-up.

07:49.215 --> 07:51.941
Cyrus, I'm putting
together a minyan

07:52.027 --> 07:54.097
for the Mourner's Kaddish.
Are you in?

07:54.183 --> 07:55.621
My first minyan!

07:55.738 --> 07:58.175
You need ten people
who've been Bar Mitzvahed.

07:58.886 --> 08:01.160
Rabbi Hurwitz,
this is my friend Jonah.

08:01.472 --> 08:05.449
Jonah? Like the prophet.
Please, join us.

08:06.511 --> 08:08.910
You can pray,
but you don't count.

08:11.332 --> 08:14.433
And you don't get out
of wearing one of these.

08:35.932 --> 08:37.979
- <i>Amen. - Amen. - Amen. - Amen.</i>
- Amen.

08:44.800 --> 08:46.418
I'm Aunt Ruthie.

08:46.504 --> 08:49.566
Oh, Hi, I'm Andi,
Cyrus' friend.

08:49.731 --> 08:50.816
Girlfriend?

08:50.925 --> 08:53.113
Oh, no, just friend.

08:53.215 --> 08:54.511
<i>Oy, vey iz mir.</i>

08:54.597 --> 08:57.066
Why can't that boy get
a girlfriend already?

08:57.613 --> 08:59.582
Oh, have you met Aunt Ruthie?

08:59.668 --> 09:01.246
- No.
- This is my dad, Bowie.

09:01.332 --> 09:03.550
- Hey.
- What is that?

09:03.636 --> 09:04.965
I made a kugel.

09:05.074 --> 09:06.918
Who said you could
make a kugel?

09:07.035 --> 09:09.496
Ah, it's an easy recipe.
Anyone can make it.

09:09.582 --> 09:12.082
I don't see raisins. Ruthie,
you changed your recipe.

09:12.168 --> 09:13.175
I made it.

09:13.293 --> 09:14.754
Who said you
can make a kugel?

09:14.840 --> 09:16.527
You didn't use raisins?

09:16.613 --> 09:18.105
This is so good.

09:18.191 --> 09:19.879
The recipe said
raisins were optional.

09:19.965 --> 09:22.863
It's not a kugel
without raisins.

09:23.409 --> 09:25.965
Aunt Ruthie? Slow down!
What's wrong?

09:26.996 --> 09:29.964
Bowie made a kugel.
It's a <i> shanda.</i>

09:30.050 --> 09:32.269
I know, it's,
it's delicious.

09:32.371 --> 09:34.879
No, a <i> shanda
</i> is a disgrace.

09:35.175 --> 09:37.902
Wow, your family
really likes raisins.

09:41.537 --> 09:43.252
I wish Bubbe Rose
had been here.

09:43.340 --> 09:45.597
She loved a good kugel fight.

09:47.308 --> 09:48.880
To Bubbe Rose.

09:49.191 --> 09:51.371
May her memory be a blessing.

09:56.207 --> 09:57.957
I've heard that said
so many times.

09:58.058 --> 10:01.527
I... can't believe
I'm saying it about her.

10:04.663 --> 10:06.373
I love you, Bubbe Rose.

10:07.582 --> 10:09.371
Cyrus, don't worry.

10:10.293 --> 10:11.633
She knows.

10:14.058 --> 10:15.438
I know she knows.

10:16.308 --> 10:18.871
But she didn't know everything.

10:19.862 --> 10:21.317
I wish she had.

10:21.403 --> 10:23.832
I wish I'd told her
when I had the chance.

10:25.437 --> 10:27.222
I was too afraid.

10:27.527 --> 10:31.465
It is your choice
who you tell and when,

10:31.738 --> 10:34.050
but you shouldn't be
afraid to do it.

10:34.215 --> 10:37.699
You underestimate how much
people care about you, Cyrus.

10:37.847 --> 10:39.730
You two made it easy,

10:39.988 --> 10:41.493
but how do I tell Jonah?

10:41.633 --> 10:43.238
You just tell him.

10:43.614 --> 10:45.374
Any time you want.

10:50.190 --> 10:51.488
You're right.

10:53.543 --> 10:55.340
Do either of you
know where he is?

10:57.173 --> 11:00.128
Wait. You're going to
tell him right now?

11:00.230 --> 11:02.363
At your grandmother's shiva?

11:03.133 --> 11:05.004
That's what Bubbe Rose
would have wanted.

11:16.752 --> 11:18.566
Are you going
to get that?

11:19.562 --> 11:21.621
Mmm... nah.

11:23.581 --> 11:26.152
Are you going to
tell me who it is?

11:26.753 --> 11:29.785
Mmm... nah.

11:41.046 --> 11:42.535
Where is he?

11:43.539 --> 11:46.730
I mean, he wouldn't leave
without saying good-bye.

11:48.120 --> 11:49.324
Would he?

11:59.861 --> 12:01.113
Jonah?

12:02.260 --> 12:03.394
Jonah!

12:04.821 --> 12:06.519
Hey, you're okay.

12:06.605 --> 12:08.535
You know what this is.
It's a panic attack.

12:08.621 --> 12:09.785
It will end.

12:09.871 --> 12:11.472
- No.
- Yes, it will.

12:11.558 --> 12:13.363
I'm here, I'm here.

12:13.449 --> 12:15.347
- You'll get through this.
- No.

12:16.503 --> 12:17.964
Yeah, up here, up, up.

12:18.050 --> 12:19.798
There you go,
there you go.

12:19.957 --> 12:21.269
That's better.

12:21.363 --> 12:22.471
Cyrus, I...

12:22.557 --> 12:25.066
Shhh! Don't talk.
Don't talk.

12:27.043 --> 12:28.208
Thank.

12:28.363 --> 12:29.991
I know it feels like
you're gonna die,

12:30.077 --> 12:31.558
but you won't.

12:32.925 --> 12:35.212
But if you did,
we're all set up for shiva.

12:41.816 --> 12:44.063
You're gonna love
this hand cream.

12:44.149 --> 12:45.555
See? It's the one I use.

12:45.672 --> 12:47.930
- Thanks, come again.
- Thank you.

12:52.016 --> 12:53.548
You hate hand cream.

12:53.633 --> 12:55.548
Yeah, but
"it's the one I use"

12:55.633 --> 12:57.766
moves more product than,
"hey, you wanna feel like

12:57.852 --> 12:59.378
you're wearing
grease gloves all day?"

12:59.463 --> 13:00.696
Didn't you and Andi have

13:00.782 --> 13:02.087
a wedding committee meeting
this morning?

13:02.172 --> 13:04.204
- Yes, we did.
- How'd it go?

13:04.290 --> 13:06.790
Very well.
We picked a color scheme,

13:06.946 --> 13:08.258
we agreed on flowers...

13:08.343 --> 13:10.128
But simple, right?
You're keeping it simple.

13:10.213 --> 13:11.418
Oh, very simple.

13:11.503 --> 13:13.875
In fact,
for the centerpieces

13:13.961 --> 13:16.418
I was thinking...
just orchids.

13:16.604 --> 13:17.689
Oh, I like orchids.

13:17.899 --> 13:19.415
You don't have
to arrange them.

13:19.501 --> 13:20.899
You just have
to set them down.

13:20.985 --> 13:23.461
Sounds just like the wedding
I refused to plan.

13:23.657 --> 13:24.878
Really?

13:24.963 --> 13:26.391
You're not just saying that?

13:26.508 --> 13:27.696
I'm saying thank you.

13:27.820 --> 13:29.079
Aww!

13:32.063 --> 13:34.930
Andi was so cute
at our meeting this morning.

13:35.063 --> 13:36.782
She wanted
to make centerpieces

13:36.868 --> 13:38.735
out of your
glued-together CDs.

13:38.821 --> 13:41.844
Oh, you mean those lamps?
I love those!

13:41.930 --> 13:44.628
Me too, but can you imagine
those as centerpieces?

13:44.713 --> 13:46.548
Yes! Would she do that?

13:46.633 --> 13:47.758
Instead of orchids?

13:47.844 --> 13:49.588
Absolutely!
Lamps versus orchids,

13:49.673 --> 13:51.516
final score
zillion to one.

13:52.235 --> 13:53.609
Oh, hey,
can I help you?

13:53.695 --> 13:56.696
Oh, you should talk
to our hand cream expert.

13:58.213 --> 13:59.321
Hi!

13:59.407 --> 14:01.969
Oh, this is the one I use.

14:05.837 --> 14:06.985
Hey.

14:09.379 --> 14:10.586
Thanks.

14:11.924 --> 14:13.806
That was a really bad one.

14:16.375 --> 14:18.353
But it's over now.

14:18.446 --> 14:20.728
I don't think they're ever
going to be over.

14:20.837 --> 14:22.868
I mean, I haven't had
a panic attack in a while,

14:23.040 --> 14:24.446
I even stopped
worrying about them,

14:24.532 --> 14:26.251
and this one, it...

14:26.353 --> 14:27.845
just came out of nowhere.

14:27.931 --> 14:29.220
That can happen.

14:29.337 --> 14:30.418
I just wish for once,

14:30.503 --> 14:32.458
someone would say
something positive,

14:32.543 --> 14:34.962
even just,
"They'll get easier."

14:35.441 --> 14:37.884
But they won't, will they?

14:38.462 --> 14:39.628
They come and go.

14:39.899 --> 14:42.298
That's what
you have to remember.

14:42.652 --> 14:43.742
They go.

14:44.383 --> 14:45.845
When you're having one,
you just have

14:45.931 --> 14:48.540
to keep telling yourself,
"This will end."

14:49.813 --> 14:51.845
I wish you could always
be there for them.

14:52.625 --> 14:55.181
Wouldn't that be fun for you?

14:56.715 --> 14:58.962
Sorry! That... that was
a horrible thing to say.

14:59.048 --> 15:00.407
No!

15:00.743 --> 15:02.983
No. It's one
of the nicest things

15:03.069 --> 15:04.729
anyone's ever said to me.

15:05.516 --> 15:07.696
I never knew how much
I'd need a friend like you.

15:09.511 --> 15:11.511
Why'd you even
come looking for me?

15:12.767 --> 15:15.423
Uh... I...

15:15.672 --> 15:18.462
There was a reason.
I can't remember it now.

15:18.595 --> 15:20.165
I'm suddenly starving.

15:20.409 --> 15:21.774
Is there food?

15:22.294 --> 15:24.157
Is there food?

15:26.220 --> 15:27.720
I feel absolutely terrible.

15:27.829 --> 15:30.103
Believe me, we feel worse.

15:30.189 --> 15:32.993
Has anyone ever been kicked out
of a shiva for bringing a kugel?

15:33.079 --> 15:34.868
In the long history
of the Jewish people,

15:34.954 --> 15:36.915
I think this is a first.

15:37.032 --> 15:38.985
I wish there was
something I can do.

15:39.071 --> 15:40.915
I want to make this right.

15:41.126 --> 15:42.478
I don't think you can.

15:42.705 --> 15:44.423
Can I at least try?

15:50.452 --> 15:52.241
Oy, here he comes.

15:54.814 --> 15:56.774
Can I have
everyone's attention?

15:58.939 --> 16:00.665
I have a confession to make.

16:01.938 --> 16:04.457
I did not make this kugel.

16:04.582 --> 16:06.118
This is a store-bought kugel.

16:06.306 --> 16:08.149
I knew it!

16:08.789 --> 16:10.681
I thought this was
a victim-less crime

16:10.767 --> 16:12.696
and I didn't realize
people would be hurt.

16:13.048 --> 16:15.649
Aunt Ruthie,
I just hope that someday,

16:15.782 --> 16:18.126
you can find it in your
heart to forgive me.

16:19.539 --> 16:21.439
I don't think so.

16:24.150 --> 16:26.751
- Hey.
- Stand back. I'm making a dramatic exit.

16:27.329 --> 16:29.564
Well, I got to know
what's going on.

16:33.001 --> 16:34.173
Help yourselves.

16:34.259 --> 16:36.618
If there's anything
that you don't recognize,

16:36.704 --> 16:38.251
don't hesitate to ask.

16:38.337 --> 16:39.579
I'm Cyrus Goodman,

16:39.688 --> 16:41.978
I'll be
your buffet tour guide.

16:42.633 --> 16:43.914
So?

16:44.000 --> 16:45.798
How did it go?
Did you tell him?

16:45.884 --> 16:48.095
No, it wasn't the right time.

16:48.470 --> 16:50.735
That's okay.
It'll happen.

16:50.868 --> 16:52.418
You'll know
when it's the right time.

16:52.573 --> 16:53.759
Cyrus, help.

16:53.845 --> 16:56.118
I'm not recognizing
anything here.

16:56.633 --> 16:59.860
Okay, well, that of course
is Aunt Ruthie's kugel.

16:59.946 --> 17:02.235
Uh, that's your classic
bagel and lox.

17:02.321 --> 17:04.164
That's gefilte fish.
Skip that.

17:04.272 --> 17:05.962
And I'm gay.

17:09.984 --> 17:11.430
Yeah?

17:13.867 --> 17:15.478
Okay, cool.

17:16.954 --> 17:18.359
Okay.

17:20.242 --> 17:21.759
Cool.

17:26.335 --> 17:27.898
Ugh, this is awful!

17:27.984 --> 17:31.001
Dude, I told you to skip
the gefilte fish!

17:32.196 --> 17:34.595
I didn't expect this
to be the hard part.

17:48.598 --> 17:50.035
It's true. Bubbe Rose

17:50.121 --> 17:52.653
would sneak cantaloupes
into the movies.

17:52.957 --> 17:54.262
How would she do that?

17:54.348 --> 17:56.739
You really want me
to tell you?

17:57.802 --> 17:59.692
You really miss her,
don't you?

17:59.817 --> 18:02.020
She thought
I was the greatest person

18:02.106 --> 18:03.436
in the world.

18:03.529 --> 18:06.395
She believed in me, even when
I didn't believe in me.

18:06.672 --> 18:09.004
I wish Cece believed in me.

18:09.129 --> 18:10.598
What are you talking about?

18:10.684 --> 18:12.574
She's your biggest fan.

18:12.676 --> 18:15.293
Yeah, well, not today.

18:15.718 --> 18:17.942
She doesn't want me
to make the centerpieces

18:18.028 --> 18:19.582
for Bex's wedding.

18:21.645 --> 18:24.305
Okay, so
she's not perfect.

18:24.539 --> 18:26.574
But you know
what she is?

18:27.521 --> 18:29.239
Still here.

18:34.736 --> 18:36.535
I'll be right back.

18:40.851 --> 18:42.871
Are shivas usually
this eventful?

18:42.957 --> 18:44.846
Well, the Goodman family
does love drama.

18:45.028 --> 18:47.567
You know the story behind
every major Jewish holiday?

18:47.653 --> 18:51.254
"They tried to kill us,
we survived, let's eat!"

18:54.762 --> 18:56.301
About this morning.

18:56.521 --> 18:57.993
I've been thinking...

18:58.079 --> 18:59.543
I have too.

19:00.021 --> 19:02.114
- I like orchids.
- Let's do the lamps.

19:02.607 --> 19:05.942
Wait, I thought
you hated the lamps.

19:06.130 --> 19:07.934
You actually like orchids?

19:08.640 --> 19:12.332
Well, they seem a little
over-confident for a flower.

19:12.780 --> 19:15.028
It's too bad we can't
ask Bex to choose.

19:15.121 --> 19:18.871
Isn't it? She absolutely
refuses to make any decisions.

19:20.051 --> 19:23.051
So, what made you
change your mind?

19:23.199 --> 19:26.145
I was just feeling like
it would be wrong

19:26.231 --> 19:28.715
not to take advantage
of your creativity.

19:29.082 --> 19:30.364
You asked Bex.

19:30.512 --> 19:31.762
I did.

19:32.270 --> 19:36.106
Which means
I was right again!

19:36.731 --> 19:38.176
But I know you feel bad,

19:38.262 --> 19:40.574
so I'm not gonna make it
worse by gloating.

19:40.715 --> 19:43.012
No, go ahead.
I would.

19:43.098 --> 19:45.226
If you insist.
Three for three!

19:45.311 --> 19:47.156
Go, Andi. Go, Andi...

19:47.242 --> 19:48.965
There's people
mourning in there.

19:51.372 --> 19:52.715
Yeah.

19:54.563 --> 19:55.943
But I'm lucky.

20:01.243 --> 20:03.317
I still have my Bubbe.

20:05.232 --> 20:07.145
Wait, what did you
just call me?

20:18.775 --> 20:21.489
Always surrounded by girls.

20:21.681 --> 20:24.121
- She's cute, yeah.
- She wants to be a model.

20:24.371 --> 20:26.363
Think you'll ever tell him
how you felt?

20:26.449 --> 20:27.886
No. Never.

20:28.074 --> 20:30.863
On the other hand,
I never thought we'd be friends.

20:30.949 --> 20:32.646
I never thought
he'd know who I was.

20:32.785 --> 20:35.168
When it comes to Jonah Beck,
so far I've been wrong

20:35.254 --> 20:36.770
about everything.

20:38.977 --> 20:40.559
Is that T.J.?

20:45.106 --> 20:46.496
You came.

20:46.704 --> 20:48.204
Of course I came.

20:50.121 --> 20:51.926
And I brought a challah.

20:52.064 --> 20:54.215
You shouldn't "chave."

20:55.871 --> 20:58.266
Who's texting you?
We're all here.

20:58.551 --> 21:00.887
Don't bother.
She won't tell you.

21:01.014 --> 21:02.022
Why not?

21:02.108 --> 21:03.192
I don't know.

21:03.278 --> 21:04.516
It's top secret.

21:04.601 --> 21:06.266
Okay.

21:06.468 --> 21:08.629
If you must know!

21:09.402 --> 21:10.746
It's Marty.

21:12.043 --> 21:13.903
- What?
- Who's Marty?

21:13.989 --> 21:15.832
- Marty from the party!
- Marty from the party!

21:15.918 --> 21:17.668
Well, that clears
everything up.

21:18.101 --> 21:20.863
So you're back in touch
with Marty, huh?

21:20.949 --> 21:22.160
I called him.

21:22.246 --> 21:25.199
Nu? You called Marty? So?

21:25.309 --> 21:26.528
I missed him.

21:26.614 --> 21:29.346
Oh, she missed him.

21:29.431 --> 21:30.918
As a friend.

21:35.781 --> 21:37.332
Whatever!

21:43.021 --> 21:44.596
<i>Next on</i> Andi Mack...

21:44.681 --> 21:46.246
- Oh.
- Hi, Bowie.

21:46.332 --> 21:47.723
Hi, Bowie.

21:47.809 --> 21:49.436
This is a surprise.

21:49.629 --> 21:51.715
So, what're you doing here?

21:51.801 --> 21:54.692
Oh, are these
wedding invitations?

21:54.778 --> 21:56.286
- Yeah.
- You know, this is my favorite

21:56.371 --> 21:59.215
part of the job? Getting to be part
of this important moment

21:59.301 --> 22:01.965
when someone's life
is gonna change forever.

22:02.051 --> 22:03.785
See? They're a couple.

22:03.871 --> 22:05.176
They're sharing a pretzel.

22:05.262 --> 22:06.606
She is still not convinced.

22:06.692 --> 22:07.951
How could you not be?

22:08.037 --> 22:10.287
Unless she knows
something we don't.
