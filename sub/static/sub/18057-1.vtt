      (slow solemn music)       

00:22.490 --> 00:25.724
     (school bell ringing)      

00:36.637 --> 00:40.172
      - [Voiceover] I           
      believe in control,       

00:40.174 --> 00:42.341
     the only force mighty      
     enough to bring order      

00:42.343 --> 00:44.710
 in the chaos that is my world. 

01:03.364 --> 01:05.129
          - Congrats!           

01:05.132 --> 01:06.832
         - Oh, thanks.          

01:06.834 --> 01:09.601
      - "Oh thanks." Like       
      it's not a big deal?      

01:09.603 --> 01:11.703
       - It's really not.       

01:11.705 --> 01:13.772
    - To some people, it is.    

01:38.466 --> 01:39.465
          - Hey Lyla.           

01:40.568 --> 01:41.533
       Sorry about the--        

01:41.535 --> 01:42.801
         - Oh, please.          

01:42.803 --> 01:45.404
       I'd much rather          
       be your VP anyway.       

01:45.406 --> 01:46.505
            - Okay.             

01:46.507 --> 01:50.309
     Alright ladies, settle     
     down, settle down.         

01:50.311 --> 01:53.245
  Alright, see we're all here.  

01:53.247 --> 01:57.249
   Oh, I had a chance to read   
   these and I have to say,     

01:57.251 --> 01:59.685
these are really, really great. 

02:00.788 --> 02:04.490
     Thought-provoking and      
     critically engaging.       

02:04.492 --> 02:08.193
   I am very, very              
   impressed with your work.    

02:11.198 --> 02:15.767
  Now, anyone who's interested  
  in a little extra credit      

02:15.769 --> 02:18.137
     should consider            
     applying to Columbia's     

02:18.139 --> 02:20.506
 annual Young Writer's Program. 

02:21.876 --> 02:26.311
They're accepting applicants    
for their pre-college workshop. 

02:29.717 --> 02:32.718
 I think you'd be a great fit.  

02:32.720 --> 02:34.153
           Yes, Lyla.           

02:34.155 --> 02:35.354
     - If we apply, can we      
     come by after school       

02:35.356 --> 02:36.922
for some extra one-on-one help? 

02:36.924 --> 02:40.259
        (girls giggling)        

02:40.261 --> 02:41.160
             - Um,              

02:42.329 --> 02:43.462
      you can use the rest      
      of the class time         

02:43.464 --> 02:45.264
   to work on the assignment.   

02:45.266 --> 02:48.800
   If you have any questions,   
   feel free to ask.            

02:50.538 --> 02:52.571
     - I got a freaking B+,     
     can you believe it?        

02:52.573 --> 02:54.373
       - You did so bad.        

02:54.375 --> 02:55.474
   - Well, what did you get?    

02:55.476 --> 02:56.441
             - Um,              

02:57.344 --> 02:58.443
           I passed.            

02:58.445 --> 03:02.281
      - He said he wasn't       
      gonna be easy on us.      

03:02.283 --> 03:05.484
       - Well, you got          
       an A, didn't you?        

03:05.486 --> 03:07.419
      - Of course she did.      

03:08.589 --> 03:11.523
        (hip-hop music)         

03:12.760 --> 03:15.494
   - [Boy In Car] Hey Belle!    

03:15.496 --> 03:16.562
          - Oh my God.          

03:17.565 --> 03:20.399
- [Boy In Car] Look what I got. 

03:23.437 --> 03:24.670
          Want a ride?          

03:24.672 --> 03:25.737
     - [Girl With Ponytail]     
     You have to say yes.       

03:25.739 --> 03:26.638
           - Say no.            

03:37.885 --> 03:38.784
           - Hi guys.           

03:39.553 --> 03:41.320
       Hey Gus, nice car.       

03:41.322 --> 03:42.821
    - [Gus] Come on, get in.    

03:42.823 --> 03:44.323
           - No way.            

03:44.325 --> 03:45.557
        - Well, why not?        

03:45.559 --> 03:48.393
      (car engine revving)      

03:48.395 --> 03:50.362
Look, I'll just drive you home. 

03:50.364 --> 03:52.397
- Gus, you don't have a license.

03:52.399 --> 03:53.498
         [Gus Scoffing]         

03:53.500 --> 03:54.566
         - Yeah, I do.          

03:54.568 --> 03:56.268
        - No, you don't.        

03:56.270 --> 03:57.636
   You have a permit, you're    
   supposed to be driving       

03:57.638 --> 03:58.971
         with a parent.         

03:58.973 --> 04:00.272
       - Yeah, well yeah        
       yeah, whatever.          

04:00.274 --> 04:01.873
     Just come on, get in.      

04:08.582 --> 04:09.481
            - Sorry.            

04:22.496 --> 04:24.496
      Then, Mr. Davy said       
      I had a good chance       

04:24.498 --> 04:26.431
at getting into the program, so 

04:26.433 --> 04:28.033
I'm gonna apply for the summer. 

04:28.035 --> 04:29.668
     - [Belle's Dad]            
     Well, that's perfect.      

04:29.670 --> 04:33.005
 - Which means I have to go     
 to Columbia for the workshop,  

04:33.007 --> 04:34.673
     which means I already      
     have a good chance         

04:34.675 --> 04:37.609
at getting in there for college.

04:37.611 --> 04:40.479
   I know it's early, but       
   you have to start thinking   

04:40.481 --> 04:43.982
  about college early, because  
  one thing affects another     

04:43.984 --> 04:45.717
      and everything else.      

04:47.921 --> 04:48.820
             - Hmm.             

04:52.293 --> 04:55.427
- Why don't you ever ask me     
how my day at school goes, dad? 

04:55.429 --> 04:59.765
   - We know we don't have      
   to worry about you, Belle.   

04:59.767 --> 05:01.433
- I got elected class president.

05:01.435 --> 05:04.303
 - [Belle's Dad] That's great,  
 sweetie, congratulations.      

05:04.305 --> 05:05.003
           - Thanks.            

05:09.476 --> 05:11.443
- President of the school, wow. 

05:11.445 --> 05:13.378
      My baby is so smart.      

05:13.380 --> 05:15.447
      - Not of the school,      
      dad, just my class.       

05:15.449 --> 05:16.915
    Like the freshman class.    

05:16.917 --> 05:19.017
        (phone buzzing)         

05:19.019 --> 05:19.985
     - [Belle's Dad] Sorry.     

05:19.987 --> 05:20.886
           Yeah, Bob.           

05:27.828 --> 05:32.064
  - [Voiceover Of Belle] Name:  
  Annabelle. Grade: freshman.   

05:33.334 --> 05:36.902
     Class: English Honors.     
     Teacher: Mr. Davy.         

05:41.408 --> 05:42.441
         My role model...       

05:45.412 --> 05:49.381
   My role model is my mom      
   because she is the person    

05:49.383 --> 05:52.351
      in my life who            
      cares most about me.      

05:53.921 --> 05:57.489
    She is smart, beautiful,    
    and hard-working,           

06:00.361 --> 06:02.060
     everything I wanna be.     

06:04.064 --> 06:05.731
       She helped me make       
       pins and posters         

06:05.733 --> 06:07.766
 for my presidential campaign,  

06:07.768 --> 06:11.370
   helped me write my speech,   
   and even baked cupcakes      

06:11.372 --> 06:12.437
          for the PTA.          

06:17.444 --> 06:19.378
     She wants to see me        
     succeed and pushes me      

06:19.380 --> 06:22.114
to live up to my full potential.

06:22.916 --> 06:24.983
    I try to make her proud.    

06:36.096 --> 06:38.830
        (ominous music)         

07:45.766 --> 07:47.933
   - Mom, mom can I come in?    

07:51.705 --> 07:53.538
      Mom! I'm coming in!       

07:56.043 --> 07:56.975
              Mom.              

08:04.485 --> 08:05.984
       Dad, where's mom?        

08:08.856 --> 08:10.589
     - Uh, in the darkroom.     

08:10.591 --> 08:14.092
       - No she's not, I        
       was just in there.       

08:14.094 --> 08:15.026
    - I don't know, sweetie.    

08:15.028 --> 08:16.561
   She must have stepped out.   

08:16.563 --> 08:18.763
       - All her photos,        
       everything's gone.       

08:18.765 --> 08:21.666
   - You know, she must have    
   had an exhibition tonight.   

08:21.668 --> 08:24.236
 - She didn't tell me about it. 

08:37.251 --> 08:38.149
              Mom.              

08:46.827 --> 08:49.261
  Hey mom, it's your Anabelle.  

08:49.263 --> 08:51.730
     Just wanna know when       
     you were coming home.      

08:51.732 --> 08:54.599
     I got some really good     
     news at school today.      

08:54.601 --> 08:57.736
Call me back when you get this. 

08:57.738 --> 09:01.306
     Oh! I'm applying for       
     this writer's program      

09:02.676 --> 09:05.277
  and I've been working on my   
  application essay all day.    

09:05.279 --> 09:09.314
 I should really take a break,  
 but I kinda wanna finish it.   

09:11.585 --> 09:13.752
   Are you at an exhibition?    

09:15.255 --> 09:16.721
       I can come visit.        

09:18.158 --> 09:20.825
Call me back when you get this. 

09:32.072 --> 09:34.839
   Mom, I didn't get to tell    
   you about the PTA meeting.   

09:34.841 --> 09:37.309
    It's Friday at seven and    
    I'm gonna give my speech    

09:37.311 --> 09:39.144
      as class president.       

09:40.314 --> 09:43.582
  Oh, that's my good news, I    
  got elected class president.  

09:43.584 --> 09:48.053
   So if you get home early,    
   maybe we can go to dinner    

09:48.055 --> 09:50.288
   or something to celebrate.   

09:51.325 --> 09:54.159
   I mean, it's not president   
   of the school, but           

09:54.161 --> 09:56.161
    it's still good, right?     

10:00.634 --> 10:02.267
      Mom, where are you?       

10:22.689 --> 10:24.789
     - Everything alright?      

10:24.791 --> 10:25.690
            - Fine.             

10:32.332 --> 10:34.232
     - You can take a break     
     every once in a while.     

10:34.234 --> 10:35.934
       - That's alright.        

10:39.773 --> 10:41.673
    - Belle, if you ever        
    need someone to talk to,    

10:41.675 --> 10:43.975
    well, you know where I      
    am, so you can always--     

10:43.977 --> 10:46.111
     - I'm good, Mr. Davy.      

10:46.113 --> 10:47.012
            Thanks.             

11:09.302 --> 11:10.368
          Is mom home?          

11:16.076 --> 11:17.242
    Have you talked to her?     

11:17.244 --> 11:19.277
     - Yeah, this morning.      

11:19.279 --> 11:23.281
    - Really? Why hasn't she    
    been answering my calls?    

11:23.283 --> 11:25.383
     - She just needs time.     

11:27.187 --> 11:28.019
          - For what?           

11:28.021 --> 11:29.254
         - For herself.         

11:30.257 --> 11:32.390
  Belle, you know how she is.   

11:39.733 --> 11:41.966
           (sighing)            

12:12.466 --> 12:15.400
        (ominous music)         

13:12.325 --> 13:14.492
    - So, are you guys doing    
    a theme for the dance?      

13:14.494 --> 13:16.194
     - Belle and I haven't      
     really discussed it.       

13:16.196 --> 13:18.864
   We'll probably talk about    
   it at the next meeting.      

13:18.865 --> 13:21.533
  - A fire-hot freshman theme,  
  kinda like an inferno!        

13:21.535 --> 13:23.368
   - Are you going with Gus?    

13:23.370 --> 13:24.335
        - To the dance?         

13:24.337 --> 13:25.904
       - No, to the moon.       

13:27.440 --> 13:31.242
   - She doesn't even wanna     
   go with him anyway, right?   

13:31.244 --> 13:33.211
       - Yeah, of course.       

13:33.213 --> 13:35.647
        - I don't know.         

13:35.648 --> 13:38.082
 In some sort of weird way,     
 they're kind of cute together. 

13:38.084 --> 13:39.284
   - You're too good for him.   

13:39.286 --> 13:40.919
     There's so many other      
     cute Briary boys.          

13:40.921 --> 13:42.153
- That your parents won't hate. 

13:42.155 --> 13:44.122
     - Oh yeah, what's up       
     with your mom anyway?      

13:44.124 --> 13:46.891
     Heard she hasn't been      
     home in like a week.       

13:46.893 --> 13:47.525
    - Where'd you hear that?    

13:47.527 --> 13:48.860
         - Small town.          

13:49.996 --> 13:53.031
       - Yeah well, she's       
       away on business.        

13:54.901 --> 13:56.401
       - Photographers          
       do business trips?       

13:56.403 --> 13:58.369
- [Blonde Girl] Where'd she go? 

13:58.371 --> 14:00.171
    - Anybody want the rest?    

14:00.173 --> 14:01.973
     I had a big breakfast.     

14:01.975 --> 14:03.274
        - I'll take it.         

14:07.314 --> 14:10.915
        (girls chatting)        

14:10.917 --> 14:12.217
          - Hey Belle.          

14:12.219 --> 14:13.551
           - Hey Gus.           

14:13.553 --> 14:14.886
- [Gus] What's going on, Belle? 

14:14.888 --> 14:16.221
      - Nothing much, Gus.      

14:16.223 --> 14:17.322
      - [Gus] Want a ride?      

14:17.324 --> 14:18.623
       - Not today, Gus.        

14:55.462 --> 14:58.930
    (computer alert beeping)    

15:25.325 --> 15:28.259
        (ominous music)         

15:48.682 --> 15:51.449
    - [Mr. Davy] Next on        
    the agenda, committees.     

15:51.451 --> 15:53.284
    Now, we're looking for      
    parents who have not yet    

15:53.286 --> 15:56.521
   signed up for a committee    
   to help with fundraising.    

15:56.523 --> 15:58.489
  - Is your mom still heading   
  publicity this year?          

15:58.491 --> 16:00.124
   - [Belle] Yes, of course.    

16:00.126 --> 16:03.161
      - When is she coming      
      back from her trip?       

16:03.163 --> 16:04.395
        - I'm not sure.         

16:04.397 --> 16:05.997
       - [Lyla] Haven't         
       you talked to her?       

16:05.999 --> 16:06.698
             - Yes.             

16:08.101 --> 16:10.785
       I left a message.        

16:10.786 --> 16:13.470
  - A message, so you haven't   
  actually spoken to her?       

16:15.508 --> 16:18.142
    She didn't really leave     
    for work, did she?          

16:18.144 --> 16:19.210
          - Excuse me.          

16:21.214 --> 16:22.447
    - [Mr. Davy] And now,       
    I'd like to turn it over    

16:22.449 --> 16:24.182
      to our headmaster...      

16:27.487 --> 16:28.753
    - [Headmaster] Welcome      
    to the first PTA meeting    

16:28.755 --> 16:30.121
       of freshman year.        

16:30.123 --> 16:32.457
           (applause)           

16:48.375 --> 16:49.424
        - Where's Belle?        

16:49.425 --> 16:50.474
       - I think she went       
       to the bathroom.         

16:50.477 --> 16:51.376
             - Now?             

17:05.492 --> 17:07.157
      - Hey, uh, nervous?       

17:08.461 --> 17:09.460
          - I'm good.           

17:11.664 --> 17:14.699
      - Yeah, you are, but      
      do you know that?         

17:14.701 --> 17:16.233
          - Know what?          

17:16.236 --> 17:17.468
         - You're good.         

17:19.105 --> 17:20.570
   Okay, (mumbles)              
   - I gotta make my speech.    

17:20.573 --> 17:22.540
      - Look, how about         
      we get out of here?       

17:22.541 --> 17:25.042
  How about I drive you home?   

17:28.615 --> 17:30.248
       Look, you know you       
       don't have to do         

17:30.250 --> 17:33.151
       anything you don't       
       want to, right?          

17:40.794 --> 17:44.629
     - Now, I'll turn it        
     over to our executive      

17:44.631 --> 17:47.365
 board freshman class president 

17:47.367 --> 17:49.467
       who will give a          
       couple of remarks        

17:49.469 --> 17:54.272
discussing some of the upcoming 
events this year, so...         

17:54.274 --> 17:56.474
           (applause)           

18:00.613 --> 18:01.846
     - Thanks, I got this.      

18:06.252 --> 18:07.518
       Thanks, Mr. Davy.        

18:09.322 --> 18:11.456
    Firstly, I just want to     
    thank all the parents       

18:11.458 --> 18:13.558
      in attendance today       
      who are so engaged        

18:13.560 --> 18:16.327
 in their children's education. 

18:20.400 --> 18:21.232
     - [Voiceover Of Belle]     
     I want to believe          

18:21.234 --> 18:22.500
     my mom is coming back.     

18:22.502 --> 18:26.637
    I mean, it's not like       
    she's done this before,     

18:26.639 --> 18:30.141
      but for some reason,      
      I'm not surprised.        

18:33.613 --> 18:36.414
     No matter how involved     
     in my life she was,        

18:36.416 --> 18:38.883
she's always seemed distracted, 

18:41.354 --> 18:45.590
  not really listening, there,  
  but not like really there.    

18:51.831 --> 18:53.698
    Well, she was there for     
    everyone else to see,       

18:53.700 --> 18:56.400
 but come to think of it, I...  

18:58.838 --> 19:02.673
    I don't remember the        
    last time she hugged me.    

20:13.713 --> 20:16.414
  - [Lyla] What are you doing?  

20:16.416 --> 20:18.549
       - [Belle] Nothing.       

20:18.551 --> 20:20.551
     - Your dad let me in.      

20:24.891 --> 20:25.723
           New hobby?           

20:25.725 --> 20:27.391
        - It's my mom's.        

20:27.393 --> 20:30.361
  - [Lyla] She won't get mad?   

20:30.363 --> 20:31.629
 - No, she said I could use it. 

20:31.631 --> 20:32.964
      - You talked to her?      

20:32.966 --> 20:36.968
     - Yeah, she just gotta     
     figure some stuff out.     

20:36.970 --> 20:37.868
            - Right.            

20:41.541 --> 20:44.542
 - Um, so do you wanna do       
 just traditional pink and red  

20:44.544 --> 20:46.310
       or red and black?        

20:46.312 --> 20:47.812
   I was actually thinking we   
   could do something classy.   

20:47.814 --> 20:51.282
   Maybe black and white        
   with pink and red accents,   

20:51.284 --> 20:55.753
 but Olivia's so set on red-hot 
 theme, that I don't know.      

20:55.755 --> 20:56.754
            - Right.            
            - Yeah.             

20:56.756 --> 20:57.989
  I found this great website.   

20:57.991 --> 21:00.658
      Here, I'll show you       
      some of my ideas.         

21:02.462 --> 21:04.662
  - [Lyla] Who is this person?  

21:05.932 --> 21:07.531
         - [Belle] Who?         

21:07.533 --> 21:09.667
  - This person, right there.   

21:14.440 --> 21:17.008
  - I don't know who that is.   

21:17.010 --> 21:18.809
- But why are you on this page? 

21:18.811 --> 21:20.645
     - I mean, it's just--      

21:21.781 --> 21:24.882
       - Why does it say        
       your name is Ana?        

21:24.884 --> 21:26.484
- Nobody uses their real names. 

21:26.486 --> 21:27.785
         - So you lie?          

21:27.787 --> 21:30.054
     - Well, Ana is the         
     first part of my name,     

21:30.056 --> 21:31.689
      so technically, no.       

21:32.592 --> 21:33.491
             - Wow.             

21:35.695 --> 21:37.595
     - It's not a big deal.     

21:39.332 --> 21:40.031
     - You're not planning      
     on killing yourself        

21:40.033 --> 21:41.465
      or anything, right?       

21:41.467 --> 21:42.366
          - What? No.           

21:42.368 --> 21:43.618
    Why would you say that?     

21:43.619 --> 21:44.869
     - I don't know, it         
     just looks like that.      

21:44.871 --> 21:46.937
    - No, it's just thinspo.    

21:48.541 --> 21:50.041
            - Right.            

21:50.043 --> 21:53.077
   - Thinspiration, just        
   inspiration to keep thin.    

21:53.079 --> 21:55.446
   - I know what thinspo is.    

22:00.853 --> 22:02.586
      - Don't tell anyone?      

22:05.792 --> 22:06.691
          - Of course.          

22:10.697 --> 22:13.464
 - [Mr. Davy] How does the 25th 

22:15.101 --> 22:17.001
         work for you?          

22:17.003 --> 22:19.370
   We should set up a meeting   
   of the executive council.    

22:19.372 --> 22:20.371
       I was thinking we        
       could get started        

22:20.373 --> 22:22.340
 on the dance early this year.  

22:22.342 --> 22:24.575
    It is our big fundraiser    
    for the spring trip,        

22:24.577 --> 22:27.078
and I was wondering if your mom 

22:27.080 --> 22:28.412
could give us some of the photos

22:28.414 --> 22:30.514
       that she has from        
       last year's dance        

22:30.516 --> 22:31.716
 to help them with his year's.  

22:31.718 --> 22:33.884
      I didn't see her          
      at the PTA meeting.       

22:33.886 --> 22:35.619
      - Oh, she was there.      

22:35.621 --> 22:36.821
           - She was?           

22:36.823 --> 22:37.722
             - Mhm.             

22:40.360 --> 22:42.493
         You know what?         

22:42.494 --> 22:44.627
   I'll tell her to bring it    
   to back-to-school night.     

22:44.630 --> 22:45.963
        - Sounds great.         

22:48.968 --> 22:51.469
     - So how are you gonna     
     pull that one off?         

22:51.471 --> 22:53.104
      - What do you mean?       

22:54.006 --> 22:56.774
- You're only lying to yourself.

23:06.552 --> 23:09.453
       (energetic music)        

23:17.463 --> 23:19.130
      - [Belle] Let's go.       

23:19.132 --> 23:20.998
      - Uh, are you sure?       

23:21.000 --> 23:21.832
     (school bell ringing)      

23:21.834 --> 23:22.833
          - Hurry up.           

23:28.508 --> 23:32.143
      (car engine revving)      

23:32.145 --> 23:33.577
- [Girl On Left] That is Belle. 

23:33.579 --> 23:34.612
     - [Girl With Gray Bag]     
     That can't be Belle.       

23:34.614 --> 23:36.714
   - Well, that's Gus's car.    

23:36.716 --> 23:40.651
  (lighthearted guitar music)   

23:44.190 --> 23:45.890
¶ Grab my hand and let's go far 

23:45.892 --> 23:47.892
      ¶ We'll never leave       
      this little car           

23:47.894 --> 23:49.827
      ¶ We'll travel here       
      and go to there           

23:49.829 --> 23:52.730
¶ You'll never be alone I swear 

23:52.732 --> 23:54.632
          ¶ I love you          

23:54.634 --> 23:58.869
       ¶ We'll smile when       
       others laugh at us       

24:00.173 --> 24:01.806
¶ Grab my hand and let's go far 

24:01.808 --> 24:03.841
      ¶ We'll never leave       
      this little car           

24:03.843 --> 24:05.876
     ¶ I'll take you here,      
     I'll take you there        

24:05.878 --> 24:07.745
       ¶ You'll never           
       have to fear again       

24:07.747 --> 24:10.080
           ¶ But fear           

24:11.818 --> 24:14.151
           ¶ Yourself           

24:16.088 --> 24:17.755
¶ Grab my hand and let's go far 

24:17.757 --> 24:19.757
      ¶ We'll never leave       
      this little car           

24:19.759 --> 24:21.725
     ¶ I'll take you here,      
     I'll take you there        

24:21.727 --> 24:24.695
    ¶ I'll take you all the     
    way to the moon, I swear    

24:24.697 --> 24:26.497
          ¶ I love you          

24:26.499 --> 24:30.534
       ¶ We'll smile when       
       others laugh at us       

24:32.104 --> 24:35.239
        ¶ Whoa whoa whoa        

24:35.241 --> 24:37.908
          ¶ Whoa whoa           

24:37.910 --> 24:40.644
        ¶ I love you so         

24:41.547 --> 24:43.514
          ¶ Whoa whoa           

24:43.516 --> 24:45.583
          ¶ Whoa whoa           

24:45.585 --> 24:48.986
 ¶ Not one two three, but four  

24:48.988 --> 24:53.224
       ¶ Times more than        
       any lover before         

24:56.128 --> 24:57.928
              ¶ Me              

24:59.632 --> 25:01.932
           ¶ Yeah, me           

25:03.569 --> 25:05.903
      ¶ Well grab my hand       
      and let's go far          

25:05.905 --> 25:06.737
      ¶ We'll never leave       
      this little car           

25:06.739 --> 25:08.005
            - Belle.            

25:08.007 --> 25:09.573
    I'm glad I ran into you,    
    I still haven't received    

25:09.575 --> 25:11.575
       your essay for the       
       application yet.         

25:11.577 --> 25:13.577
    - Oh, I'm not finished.     

25:15.581 --> 25:17.248
   - Okay, well please hurry.   

25:17.249 --> 25:18.916
       That deadline is         
       fast approaching.        

25:18.918 --> 25:21.218
       - Of course. I'll        
       have it done soon.       

25:21.220 --> 25:23.053
     - [Mr. Davy] Perfect.      

25:51.183 --> 25:53.317
     - (Imitating whipping      
     sound) Whipped!            

25:53.319 --> 25:55.586
     - Joey, just shut up.      

25:55.588 --> 25:57.087
- You know, you smell like ass. 

25:57.089 --> 25:57.888
           - Oh yeah?           

25:57.890 --> 26:00.024
     Well, you are an ass.      

26:00.026 --> 26:01.559
        - How precious.         

26:02.328 --> 26:05.129
    - Joey, I swear to God,     
    if you don't leave me--     

26:05.131 --> 26:07.565
    - Uh oh, uh oh, preppy's    
    gonna get serious.          

26:07.567 --> 26:09.767
      - Joey, get the           
      hell out of my room.      

26:09.769 --> 26:10.968
    - [Joey] Yeah, well         
    tell someone who cares.     

26:10.970 --> 26:13.270
- Joey, get out of my room now. 

26:13.272 --> 26:15.339
         - You get out.         

26:15.341 --> 26:16.640
         (Gus sighing)          

26:16.642 --> 26:18.242
          - [Gus] God!          

26:18.244 --> 26:22.313
(Joey imitating whipping sound) 

26:38.197 --> 26:39.096
           - Really?            

26:43.703 --> 26:45.636
- Hey Belle, how was your break?

26:45.638 --> 26:46.670
            - Great.            

26:46.672 --> 26:48.339
        - We didn't hear        
        from you at all.        

26:48.341 --> 26:51.375
    I was the lucky one who     
    didn't get a present.       

26:51.377 --> 26:54.378
      - Oh, I'm so sorry,       
      I completely forgot       

26:54.380 --> 26:55.713
    about our Secret Santa.     

26:55.715 --> 26:58.115
    - Yeah, and the student     
    council meeting.            

26:58.117 --> 27:00.684
 - Don't worry, I'll be there.  

27:00.686 --> 27:02.319
      - It was yesterday.       

27:04.957 --> 27:06.290
     Are you still planning     
     for the dance?             

27:06.292 --> 27:07.958
       - Yeah, of course.       

27:07.960 --> 27:09.927
  - Okay, because it just       
  seems like Lyla's been doing  

27:09.929 --> 27:11.829
  all the work and the party    
  committee was just wondering  

27:11.831 --> 27:14.131
    if we should listen to      
    her because you haven't     

27:14.133 --> 27:16.166
      really been telling       
      us what to do.            

27:16.168 --> 27:18.235
    - Yeah, I spoke to Lyla.    

27:19.338 --> 27:21.171
      Just listen to her.       

27:22.408 --> 27:25.843
     (school bell ringing)      

27:26.912 --> 27:29.980
      (slow solemn music)       

27:35.421 --> 27:36.320
            - Next.             

27:40.926 --> 27:43.661
Come on, put that down. Step up.

27:53.105 --> 27:53.804
              85.2              

27:57.810 --> 27:58.976
            - What?             

27:58.978 --> 28:00.377
          - You're 85.          

28:00.379 --> 28:01.345
           - Really?            

28:01.347 --> 28:02.780
         - [Nurse] Yep.         

28:45.324 --> 28:48.792
    (computer alert beeping)    

29:44.049 --> 29:46.166
     - Excuse me, hi, yes.      

29:46.167 --> 29:48.284
 This is Mr. Davy, I'm looking  
 for one of my students,        

29:48.287 --> 29:49.953
           Anabelle.            

29:49.955 --> 29:53.924
   I was wondering what class   
   she's in this period.        

29:53.926 --> 29:56.226
  The freshman, that's right.   

30:05.404 --> 30:07.304
    - You wanted to see me?     

30:07.306 --> 30:09.139
      - Yes, have a seat.       

30:14.313 --> 30:15.913
        I was going over        
        the applications        

30:15.915 --> 30:17.915
 for the program the other day, 

30:17.917 --> 30:20.851
and I couldn't find your essay. 

30:20.853 --> 30:24.354
     So I was wondering         
     when you handed it in.     

30:25.357 --> 30:26.356
          - I didn't.           

30:31.130 --> 30:32.029
           - Why not?           

30:37.870 --> 30:40.237
     Do you still want to?      

30:40.239 --> 30:41.905
      Do you want me to         
      pull a few strings?       

30:41.907 --> 30:43.507
       Want me to get you       
       some more time?          

30:43.509 --> 30:44.408
             - No,              

30:45.444 --> 30:47.244
     that's okay Mr. Davy.      

30:48.180 --> 30:49.513
        - Are you sure?         

30:55.187 --> 30:57.254
     Is everything alright?     

30:57.256 --> 30:58.121
            - Fine.             

31:01.193 --> 31:02.459
     - Belle, I know you're     
     upset about the grade      

31:02.461 --> 31:04.127
       you received this        
       marking period,          

31:04.129 --> 31:06.630
    but that doesn't mean       
    that you should give up.    

31:06.632 --> 31:07.531
           - I know.            

31:09.935 --> 31:11.501
       - Look, when I was       

31:12.638 --> 31:16.607
  first starting out, I wanted  
  to be a science teacher,      

31:18.644 --> 31:22.246
    but I got stuck             
    teaching English instead    

31:24.450 --> 31:26.550
  which turned out to be okay   

31:27.653 --> 31:30.487
    because I still got to      
    do what I wanted to do.     

31:30.489 --> 31:32.556
    I got to teach you guys.    

31:35.027 --> 31:39.296
    I guess what I'm saying     
    is life isn't perfect       

31:39.298 --> 31:41.365
      and you can't always      
      get what you want,        

31:41.367 --> 31:43.634
 but you can get pretty close.  

31:49.208 --> 31:51.275
    - What took you so long?    

31:51.277 --> 31:52.175
            - Sorry,            

31:53.545 --> 31:55.946
       a teacher kept me.       

31:55.948 --> 31:58.115
       - Was it Mr. Davy?       

31:58.117 --> 32:00.350
    And give you that rose?     

32:00.352 --> 32:02.986
- Do you have to smoke in here? 

32:04.356 --> 32:06.256
   - You kinda stress me out.   

32:06.258 --> 32:08.091
         - It's nasty.          

32:08.093 --> 32:10.427
     - So open the window.      

32:10.429 --> 32:11.628
        - It's freezing.        

32:11.630 --> 32:14.231
  - You complain way too much.  

32:15.401 --> 32:17.334
 - You really shouldn't smoke.  

32:17.336 --> 32:18.402
       - Why, because           
       you don't like it?       

32:18.404 --> 32:20.037
             - No,              

32:20.039 --> 32:22.372
      well, yeah, but it's      
      not good for you.         

32:22.374 --> 32:26.410
  - Well starving yourself      
  isn't good for you neither.   

32:35.387 --> 32:37.054
      So I was wondering,       

32:40.359 --> 32:43.093
     wanna go to the dance?     

32:43.095 --> 32:45.429
  - Is this a trick question?   

32:45.431 --> 32:47.197
     - Uh, why you gotta        
     make it so difficult?      

32:47.199 --> 32:48.465
        - Are you asking        
        me if I wanna go        

32:48.467 --> 32:50.200
   or if I wanna go with you?   

32:50.202 --> 32:52.169
   - Do you wanna go to the     
   dance with me? Yes or no.    

32:52.171 --> 32:55.205
- Yes, yes, I wanna go with you.

32:55.207 --> 32:56.440
            - Cool.             

32:56.442 --> 32:57.841
       - [Belle] What           
       changed your mind?       

32:57.842 --> 32:59.241
     - You know, I just         
     thought I'd steal you      

32:59.244 --> 33:01.445
 before Mr. Davy gets a chance. 

33:01.447 --> 33:03.213
       - [Belle] Shut up.       

33:03.215 --> 33:04.014
           - Make me.           

33:04.016 --> 33:05.248
           - Shut up.           

33:05.250 --> 33:06.183
  - No, hey make me, make me,   
  - No stop!                    

33:06.185 --> 33:08.185
 - Come one, make me, come on.  

33:25.137 --> 33:28.205
      (slow solemn music)       

34:01.306 --> 34:02.706
      - So, I really need       
      to lose a few pounds      

34:02.708 --> 34:04.775
   to fit into this gorgeous    
   dress that I tried on.       

34:04.777 --> 34:06.510
       But it's gonna be        
       totally worth it         

34:06.512 --> 34:09.312
     when somebody actually     
     asks me to go.             

34:09.313 --> 34:11.681
   - You should ask Belle       
   to teach you her secrets.    

34:11.683 --> 34:13.116
   You could do that, right?    

34:13.118 --> 34:15.217
     You slimmed down from      
     all that thinspo.          

34:15.219 --> 34:16.119
             - Oh.              

34:17.456 --> 34:19.523
  I mean, it was just nothing.  

34:19.525 --> 34:21.792
      I was just stressed.      

34:21.793 --> 34:25.228
     - What? When I'm           
     stressed, I eat more.      

34:29.668 --> 34:30.833
         - So, are you          

34:32.337 --> 34:34.471
guys have any date to the dance?

34:34.473 --> 34:35.505
    - [Curly-Haired Girl] We    
    should all go together.     

34:35.507 --> 34:36.540
     - [Girl With Ponytail]     
     No, I have a date.         

34:36.541 --> 34:37.574
   - [Curly-Haired Girl] Who?   

34:37.576 --> 34:39.141
        - Ryan asked me.        

34:39.143 --> 34:41.678
Does that mean Gus is going too?

34:44.583 --> 34:45.815
    - [Curly-Haired Girl]       
    Oh my gosh, oh my gosh,     

34:45.818 --> 34:49.351
     that's amazing, can        
     you guys believe this?     

34:49.353 --> 34:51.288
    - [Girl With Ponytail]      
    I mean, it's a bad idea.    

34:51.290 --> 34:52.688
   - [Curly-Haired Girl] Come   
   on, it's not a bad idea.     

34:52.690 --> 34:54.190
     - [Girl With Ponytail]     
     It's not a bad idea,       

34:54.193 --> 34:56.327
       it's a great idea.       

34:56.328 --> 34:58.462
   - [Curly-Haired Girl]        
   It's okay, I mean come on,   

34:58.464 --> 35:00.564
       be happy for her.        

35:00.566 --> 35:04.367
   - Now, to get us in the      
   mood for Valentine's Day,    

35:04.369 --> 35:08.605
   we are going to be reading   
   some of your love sonnets.   

35:11.210 --> 35:14.377
      (speaker drowns out)      

35:18.383 --> 35:20.717
  Who would like to go first?   

35:22.287 --> 35:24.721
   Great, Belle, thank you      
   so much for volunteering.    

35:24.723 --> 35:25.856
    Why don't you come up to    
    the front of the class      

35:25.858 --> 35:27.424
       to present for us.       

35:30.629 --> 35:34.865
   (girls gasping)              
   - [Classmates] Oh my God.    

35:51.583 --> 35:52.482
           - Did I...           

35:54.419 --> 35:55.819
        Did I pass out?         

35:55.821 --> 35:56.753
             - Mhm.             

36:13.372 --> 36:16.373
      - I think I'm still       
      queasy from biology.      

36:16.375 --> 36:18.542
    We're dissecting frogs.     

36:20.445 --> 36:21.811
       - Everything okay?       

36:21.813 --> 36:23.180
         - She's fine.          

36:24.249 --> 36:26.416
    I just called her           
    father, he's on his way     

36:26.418 --> 36:27.717
        to pick her up.         

36:27.719 --> 36:29.953
      - Oh no, you didn't       
      have to do that.          

36:29.955 --> 36:31.388
       - Oh yes she did.        

36:31.390 --> 36:34.324
       School protocol,         
       right Nurse Duffy?       

36:34.326 --> 36:37.861
    Mind if I have a moment     
    to speak with Belle?        

36:38.697 --> 36:39.596
           Thank you.           

36:53.378 --> 36:56.546
 Belle, I'm worried about you.  

36:56.548 --> 36:58.415
    - Well you shouldn't be.    

36:58.417 --> 37:02.319
    - You've been missing       
    class quite frequently.     

37:02.321 --> 37:03.753
- Kids miss class all the time. 

37:03.755 --> 37:07.624
    - Not kids with perfect     
    attendance records.         

37:08.527 --> 37:11.528
       How's everything         
       with your friends?       

37:11.530 --> 37:13.530
        - [Belle] Fine.         

37:13.532 --> 37:16.600
      - How are things          
      at home? How's dad?       

37:19.972 --> 37:22.005
        - I don't know.         

37:22.007 --> 37:24.441
  - [Mr. Davy] You don't know?  

37:24.443 --> 37:26.843
  - I haven't seen him lately.  

37:29.715 --> 37:31.715
    - Well, what about mom?     

37:43.562 --> 37:45.829
Belle, you're a really wonderful
role model for this school.     

37:45.831 --> 37:47.330
     - I should get going.      

37:47.332 --> 37:48.398
- All the girls look up to you. 

37:48.400 --> 37:49.933
        - I have to go--        

37:49.935 --> 37:51.001
  - And I know your mom would   
  be very proud if she knew--   

37:51.003 --> 37:51.901
           - Enough!            

37:57.976 --> 38:00.477
 - I'm here if you wanna talk.  

38:34.079 --> 38:37.714
   (cellphone alerts beeping)   

38:55.834 --> 38:59.035
          (rock music)          

38:59.037 --> 39:01.638
  - She doesn't need you, Gus.  

39:02.674 --> 39:05.675
       All she needs is a       
       car and a way out.       

39:05.677 --> 39:08.378
     Don't be stupid, okay?     

39:08.380 --> 39:09.463
     You really think she's     
     gonna give a shit          

39:09.464 --> 39:10.547
      about you as much as      
      you care about her?       

39:10.549 --> 39:11.614
          Huh? Do you?          

39:18.523 --> 39:21.591
 (Belle's dad clearing throat)  

39:21.593 --> 39:22.992
        - I'm fine, dad.        

39:22.994 --> 39:26.463
     - [Belle's Dad] What's     
     the problem now?           

39:26.465 --> 39:28.898
       - I just forgot          
       to eat breakfast.        

39:28.900 --> 39:31.668
  - Why aren't you eating?      
  We have food in this house.   

39:31.670 --> 39:34.704
     - It's not a big deal,     
     I'm just stressed.         

39:34.706 --> 39:36.606
       - You're stressed?       

39:36.608 --> 39:38.742
You don't have to pay the bills.

39:38.744 --> 39:39.976
       You don't have to        
       get the groceries.       

39:39.978 --> 39:41.378
       You don't have to        
       do the laundry.          

39:41.380 --> 39:43.146
     You don't have one         
     person to worry about.     

39:43.148 --> 39:45.548
     You go to school, you      
     keep your room clean,      

39:45.550 --> 39:47.016
you do your homework, that's it.

39:47.018 --> 39:48.551
    - Don't you think that's    
    hard enough sometimes?      

39:48.553 --> 39:50.053
   - Then why don't you spend   
   more time on your work       

39:50.055 --> 39:51.755
 and less time in the darkroom? 

39:51.757 --> 39:53.390
        - Dad, come on.         

39:53.392 --> 39:54.824
      - What are you            
      trying to be anyway?      

39:54.826 --> 39:58.128
     You trying to be more      
     like your mother?          

40:03.034 --> 40:04.033
       I don't want you         
       in there anymore.        

40:04.035 --> 40:05.468
             - Dad!             

40:05.470 --> 40:06.403
    - You've gotta learn to     
    be responsible, Belle.      

40:06.405 --> 40:08.671
   - I'm trying really hard.    

40:08.673 --> 40:10.473
       - Look, I've gotta       
       get back to work,        

40:10.475 --> 40:13.009
but I need you to eat something.

40:16.915 --> 40:18.748
 - I'm really not that hungry.  

40:18.750 --> 40:22.986
   - The nurse said I have to   
   watch you eat it, Belle.     

40:24.523 --> 40:27.090
 - I'll eat it in a little bit. 

40:48.647 --> 40:49.612
          - One bite.           

41:13.505 --> 41:14.604
           Thank you.           

41:18.610 --> 41:21.144
I'll be home in time for dinner.

41:23.515 --> 41:24.681
          I love you.           

41:31.857 --> 41:35.692
  (Belle coughing and gagging)  

41:47.539 --> 41:50.540
       (foreboding music)       

43:31.343 --> 43:32.775
           - Hey dad.           

43:32.777 --> 43:35.745
    I think you should be       
    on your way home by now,    

43:35.747 --> 43:37.280
     but if you're staying      
     late, that's cool.         

43:37.282 --> 43:38.381
            Just...             

43:38.383 --> 43:42.085
 I ordered in tonight, just     
 call me back when you get this 

43:42.087 --> 43:46.255
   and maybe I can call them    
   to come a little later.      

43:48.093 --> 43:49.092
          Never mind.           

43:56.201 --> 43:57.834
      - Hey, ready to go?       

44:00.271 --> 44:01.371
            - Where?            

44:02.374 --> 44:05.375
      Oh, I forgot, I           
      forgot to call you.       

44:07.045 --> 44:09.879
       I'm gonna have to        
       cancel tonight.          

44:11.650 --> 44:14.117
    - You're kidding, right?    

44:14.119 --> 44:17.353
      - Well, my dad is on      
      his way home, so...       

44:17.355 --> 44:18.655
             - So?              

44:18.657 --> 44:22.959
    - So he sort of picked      
    me up from school today     

44:22.961 --> 44:24.661
        after I fainted.        

44:24.663 --> 44:26.396
      - Wait, you fainted?      

44:28.833 --> 44:30.833
    Why didn't you call me?     

44:37.709 --> 44:41.411
    You know, when he wasn't    
    there for you, I was.       

44:46.351 --> 44:49.952
    (door hinges squeaking)     

45:06.805 --> 45:08.438
      - Oh, back so soon?       

45:10.108 --> 45:11.340
         What happened?         

45:13.278 --> 45:15.912
  - It's just her stupid dad.   

45:18.016 --> 45:20.183
   Can't mess with the pops.    

46:16.975 --> 46:19.876
       (toilet flushing)        

46:56.347 --> 46:59.081
        (ominous music)         

47:19.137 --> 47:21.437
          (rock music)          

48:41.119 --> 48:42.351
          - Hey girls.          

48:42.353 --> 48:44.287
       - Oh, hi Mr. Davy.       

48:44.289 --> 48:45.688
     - Where's Belle today?     

48:45.690 --> 48:49.292
  - I don't know, we haven't    
  really seen her much lately.  

48:49.294 --> 48:51.795
         - Is that so?          

48:51.796 --> 48:54.297
   - Yeah, she's been hanging   
   out with her boy toy.        

48:54.299 --> 48:55.197
           - Shut up.           

48:56.334 --> 48:58.151
      - Well, if she's not      
      in school tomorrow,       

48:58.152 --> 48:59.969
please let her know that she    
will not be going to the dance. 

48:59.971 --> 49:02.605
      She should be             
      setting an example.       

49:07.412 --> 49:10.379
    - Are you messaging her?    

49:10.381 --> 49:11.447
          - Of course.          

49:18.589 --> 49:22.358
   (cellphone alert beeping)    

49:39.544 --> 49:41.077
      - Can I get my            
      girlfriend for like,      

49:41.079 --> 49:42.611
      five minutes please?      

49:57.762 --> 49:58.661
              Hey.              

50:03.134 --> 50:05.501
 - Can you untwist this please? 

50:06.404 --> 50:07.503
            - Okay.             

50:20.084 --> 50:21.217
         There you go.          

50:35.033 --> 50:38.267
So do you like the movie so far?

50:38.269 --> 50:40.469
       - [Belle] It's           
       okay, it's boring.       

50:40.471 --> 50:43.406
      - But you're the one      
      that suggested it.        

50:43.408 --> 50:47.076
     - Well, I suggested it     
     because you like it.       

50:47.078 --> 50:49.745
      - Okay, then what         
      do you wanna watch?       

50:49.747 --> 50:51.814
   People kissing in the rain   
   or something like that?      

50:51.816 --> 50:52.715
             - No.              

51:15.139 --> 51:16.639
  - (Sighing) Okay, seriously.  

51:16.641 --> 51:18.107
      Are you ever gonna        
      put that thing down?      

51:18.109 --> 51:18.808
           - Um, no.            

51:53.444 --> 51:55.744
 - Hey, do you want my zip-up?  

51:55.746 --> 51:57.446
 - I'll just turn the heat up.  

51:57.448 --> 51:58.547
        - But it's hot.         

51:58.549 --> 52:01.450
- I'll just get a sweater then. 

52:01.452 --> 52:03.385
      - Okay, what's            
      with your attitude?       

52:03.387 --> 52:04.587
    - Sorry I'm not perfect!    

52:04.588 --> 52:05.788
     - You could just be        
     a little nicer to me.      

52:05.790 --> 52:07.389
       - Well, I can't          
       please everybody.        

52:07.391 --> 52:09.525
       - What? Okay, what       
       is your problem?         

52:09.527 --> 52:11.494
  - So now, I have a problem?   

52:11.496 --> 52:15.197
    - Look, that's not          
    what I said, it's just...   

52:15.199 --> 52:15.898
            God, um.            

52:17.902 --> 52:19.301
     Okay, how about this?      

52:19.303 --> 52:21.670
      How about I'll just       
      pause the movie           

52:21.672 --> 52:23.405
and you can go get your sweater?

52:23.407 --> 52:25.341
   - Don't bother, I'm just     
   gonna go to the darkroom.    

52:25.343 --> 52:26.909
     I've got stuff to do.      

52:26.911 --> 52:28.611
 - Wait, hold up. Stuff to do?  

52:28.613 --> 52:30.412
       What, is it more         
       important than me?       

52:30.414 --> 52:31.514
           - I guess.           

52:33.451 --> 52:34.550
        - Alright fine.         

52:34.552 --> 52:35.484
I guess I'm not important enough

52:35.486 --> 52:37.520
 to take you to the dance then. 

52:37.522 --> 52:39.022
            - What?             

52:39.023 --> 52:40.523
      - You heard me, I         
      said I'm not going.       

52:40.525 --> 52:42.892
      - [Belle] Stop, stop      
      being ridiculous.         

52:42.894 --> 52:45.294
- Really? 'Cause I was thinking 
the same thing about you.       

52:45.296 --> 52:46.629
- What's that supposed to mean? 

52:46.631 --> 52:48.597
- You can be so smart sometimes,

52:48.599 --> 52:51.267
       but yet, so dumb         
       at the same time.        

52:51.269 --> 52:52.535
    - I'm dumb? You're dumb.    

52:52.537 --> 52:54.603
    I'm not the one failing     
    out of high school.         

52:54.605 --> 52:56.605
   - I'm missing my math test   
   right now because of you.    

52:56.607 --> 52:57.573
          - Whatever.           

52:57.575 --> 52:59.687
          You're dumb!          

52:59.688 --> 53:01.800
     - I'm not dumb enough      
     to starve myself           

53:01.801 --> 53:03.913
and think that it's gonna bring 
my mommy back or something.     

53:10.922 --> 53:13.589
         (Belle crying)         

53:19.597 --> 53:20.829
    - [Automated Voice] Your    
    call has been forwarded     

53:20.831 --> 53:23.599
 to an automated voice message. 

54:09.313 --> 54:10.246
       (banging on door)        

54:10.248 --> 54:12.414
 - [Gus] Belle, open the door.  

54:12.416 --> 54:13.882
 Belle, come on, open the door. 

54:13.884 --> 54:15.618
      - I'm fine, get out!      

54:36.941 --> 54:40.976
   - Come on, Belle, open the   
   (screaming)                  

54:40.978 --> 54:42.378
         - [Belle] Mom.         

54:42.380 --> 54:45.514
     - [Belle's Dad] No         
     sweetie, it's just me.     

55:13.878 --> 55:15.477
          - I'm sorry.          

55:15.479 --> 55:19.581
   - [Belle's Dad] It's         
   okay. It's okay, sweetie.    

55:22.687 --> 55:24.520
     - I really messed up.      

55:26.824 --> 55:28.490
       - You're perfect.        

55:34.498 --> 55:37.499
       (foreboding music)       

55:44.975 --> 55:46.608
           - Hey Gus.           

55:46.610 --> 55:47.993
       - [Gus] Hey Lyla.        

55:47.994 --> 55:49.377
    - I heard you were going    
    to the dance with Belle.    

55:49.380 --> 55:50.546
   - Okay look, I don't have    
   time for this right now.     

55:50.548 --> 55:52.514
    - Where is Belle anyway?    

55:52.516 --> 55:53.549
    - Don't worry about it.     

55:53.550 --> 55:54.583
      - [Lyla] Wasn't           
      she with you today?       

55:54.585 --> 55:55.451
     - Well yeah, she was.      

55:55.453 --> 55:57.553
    - [Lyla] Another fight?     

55:57.555 --> 55:58.987
     - Why don't you just       
     stay out of it, okay?      

55:58.989 --> 56:00.556
       - That's not what        
       you usually say.         

56:00.558 --> 56:01.890
       - [Gus] What do          
       you want from me?        

56:01.892 --> 56:03.092
   - Just a concerned friend.   

56:03.094 --> 56:05.828
         (Gus scoffing)         

56:10.434 --> 56:12.534
     - [Gus] Look Mr. Davy,     
     we need to talk, okay?     

56:12.536 --> 56:13.369
         - Gus, right.          

56:13.371 --> 56:14.036
    I heard a lot about you.    

56:14.038 --> 56:15.471
     - [Gus] One and only.      

56:15.473 --> 56:16.661
       - Look, I'm sorry.       

56:16.662 --> 56:17.850
      I don't have time         
      for whatever trouble      

56:17.851 --> 56:19.039
     you've gotten              
     yourself into now, I--     

56:19.043 --> 56:21.610
   - Just give me two           
   minutes, just two minutes.   

56:21.612 --> 56:23.712
   - Don't they have            
   counselors over at Briary?   

56:23.714 --> 56:25.080
       I really don't           
       have time to spare       

56:25.082 --> 56:27.015
       for any of you           
       boys, I apologize.       

56:27.017 --> 56:28.550
     - Yeah, that's right.      

56:28.552 --> 56:30.819
    Focus most of your time     
    on these ladies, huh?       

56:30.821 --> 56:32.020
          - Excuse me?          

56:32.022 --> 56:33.622
       That was extremely       
       disrespectful.           

56:33.624 --> 56:35.124
         (Gus scoffing)         
         Hey.                   

56:35.126 --> 56:38.460
   I take my job seriously.     
   I worked very hard for it.   

56:38.462 --> 56:40.496
      - Okay look, I know       
      you don't like me,        

56:40.498 --> 56:43.799
     right back at ya, this     
     is very important.         

56:46.637 --> 56:47.836
      - What do you mean?       

56:47.838 --> 56:48.637
    - Belle, I've scheduled     
    a follow-up meeting         

56:48.639 --> 56:50.406
     with the nurse today.      

56:50.408 --> 56:51.774
    I'd appreciate it if you    
    saw her after school.       

56:51.776 --> 56:53.976
   - But I'm supposed to help   

56:53.978 --> 56:55.944
      set up for the            
      dance after school.       

56:55.946 --> 56:57.179
- Without a pass from the nurse,

56:57.181 --> 57:01.183
    you won't even be           
    allowed into the dance.     

57:01.185 --> 57:02.618
         School policy.         

57:05.956 --> 57:07.156
   (cellphone alert beeping)    

57:07.158 --> 57:09.124
      - Did you steal           
      those from the gym?       

57:09.126 --> 57:10.526
     - I'll give them back.     

57:10.528 --> 57:12.961
     - [Brunette Girl]          
     That's not the point.      

57:12.963 --> 57:14.530
     - [Lyla] Drink plenty      
     of water to add weight     

57:14.532 --> 57:16.598
    without adding calories.    

57:20.604 --> 57:22.438
       - I can't believe        
       we're doing this.        

57:22.440 --> 57:23.639
      - I find it quite         
      admirable, actually.      

57:23.641 --> 57:24.673
   - [Brunette Girl] Olivia!    

57:24.675 --> 57:26.208
            - What?             

57:26.210 --> 57:28.610
  If I can't go to the dance,   
  we might as well help Belle.  

57:28.612 --> 57:29.845
- Why can't you go to the dance?

57:29.847 --> 57:31.547
 - You failed math, didn't you? 

57:31.549 --> 57:33.048
  - [Brunette Girl] Whatever.   

57:33.050 --> 57:34.950
      Like, as soon as          
      this dance is over,       

57:34.952 --> 57:36.785
 you have to eat something and  

57:36.787 --> 57:38.787
     we'll get you help and     
     we'll tell someone.        

57:38.789 --> 57:40.489
     - [Belle] No, I'm          
     fine, stay out of it.      

57:40.491 --> 57:42.624
   - [Olivia] I don't think     
   that's an option anymore.    

57:42.626 --> 57:45.761
      - Why don't you just      
      eat something now?        

57:46.797 --> 57:49.631
      - Really, I'm okay,       
      and thank you.            

57:52.203 --> 57:55.571
      Okay, now give me         
      all of your change.       

58:08.586 --> 58:10.486
     - [Nurse] Have a seat.     

58:17.194 --> 58:18.627
        - Alright class.        

58:18.629 --> 58:21.897
    I'd like to congratulate    
    a very special student      

58:21.899 --> 58:24.900
      for getting into the      
      Columbia program.         

58:24.902 --> 58:27.603
     I'd like to share that     
     Lyla has been accepted     

58:27.605 --> 58:28.837
    and will be taking part     

58:28.839 --> 58:30.072
    in this great               
    opportunity this summer.    

58:30.074 --> 58:31.607
      So let's go ahead         
      and give her a hand.      

58:31.609 --> 58:34.610
       (class applauding)       

58:37.748 --> 58:40.115
    - Do I need to undress.     

58:40.117 --> 58:42.184
    - [Nurse] Not necessary.    

58:47.858 --> 58:51.226
      - So will I be able       
      to go to the dance?       

58:51.228 --> 58:54.663
     (school bell ringing)      

58:59.803 --> 59:01.570
            Hey Gus.            

59:01.572 --> 59:02.771
        I'm sorry again.        

59:04.008 --> 59:06.909
       Can we please go         
       together tonight?        

59:07.745 --> 59:08.644
            Call me.            

59:13.083 --> 59:17.185
   (cellphone alert beeping)    

59:17.187 --> 59:19.755
         (Gus sighing)          

01:00:00.130 --> 01:00:01.363
   - I can do your hair next.   

01:00:01.365 --> 01:00:05.000
    - Nah, I think I'm just     
    gonna leave it alone.       

01:00:08.872 --> 01:00:11.106
   - Since when do you smoke?   

01:00:11.108 --> 01:00:12.808
      - Helps with nerves.      

01:00:12.810 --> 01:00:15.344
       - [Lyla] What are        
       you nervous about?       

01:00:15.346 --> 01:00:17.312
      - And it doesn't          
      make me that hungry.      

01:00:17.314 --> 01:00:18.747
         - There we go.         

01:00:38.268 --> 01:00:41.169
       Is that from the         
       Columbia program?        

01:00:42.806 --> 01:00:45.374
  I thought you didn't apply.   

01:00:45.376 --> 01:00:46.375
          - I didn't.           

01:00:52.349 --> 01:00:54.016
       - Did you get in?        

01:01:00.991 --> 01:01:01.890
            Course.             

01:01:03.293 --> 01:01:04.860
       What do you think?       

01:01:08.732 --> 01:01:10.365
         - Looks great.         

01:01:10.367 --> 01:01:13.168
       - Try yours on so        
       we can compare.          

01:01:34.324 --> 01:01:36.158
      - I can't wear this.      

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:37.426
       - [Lyla] Why not?        

01:01:38.896 --> 01:01:40.362
   - I don't like it anymore.   

01:01:40.364 --> 01:01:42.798
     I think I'm just gonna     
     wear something else.       

01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:45.467
    - You spent all your        
    allowance on that dress.    

01:01:45.469 --> 01:01:47.402
 Isn't that why you've been     
 practically starving yourself? 

01:01:47.404 --> 01:01:48.837
            - What?             

01:01:48.839 --> 01:01:49.805
              No.               

01:01:49.807 --> 01:01:51.073
I mean, yeah, I used the money, 

01:01:51.075 --> 01:01:53.742
but I didn't do it for a dress. 

01:01:55.713 --> 01:01:56.478
          - Then why?           

01:01:57.314 --> 01:01:58.780
            For Gus?            

01:01:58.782 --> 01:01:59.481
           - For me.            

01:02:00.818 --> 01:02:01.717
             - Oh.              

01:02:03.387 --> 01:02:06.722
       Well, just throw a       
       jacket on over it.       

01:02:10.461 --> 01:02:14.496
      (dance music)             
      (students chatting)       

01:03:08.252 --> 01:03:12.487
     ¶ I wasn't counting        
     on breaking your heart     

01:03:13.457 --> 01:03:18.160
¶ Now, I'm just counting on luck

01:03:18.162 --> 01:03:19.828
       - Belle, what are        
       you doing here?          

01:03:19.830 --> 01:03:21.296
     - Why shouldn't I be?      

01:03:21.298 --> 01:03:23.098
     - Do you have a note?      

01:03:27.905 --> 01:03:28.537
     Where'd you get this?      

01:03:28.539 --> 01:03:30.338
          - The nurse.          

01:03:30.340 --> 01:03:31.573
         - Where's Gus?         

01:03:33.277 --> 01:03:34.910
      - He couldn't come.       

01:03:36.013 --> 01:03:37.546
    - Don't pull this shit      
    with me, I need the car.    

01:03:37.548 --> 01:03:39.080
           - Hell no.           

01:03:39.082 --> 01:03:40.448
    - Joey, I need the car.     

01:03:40.450 --> 01:03:41.917
 Please, just give me the keys. 

01:03:41.919 --> 01:03:43.451
    - Why, so you can see       
    your little girlfriend?     

01:03:43.453 --> 01:03:44.986
        - Come on Joey.         

01:03:47.491 --> 01:03:49.391
      - Do you still think      
      I can give my speech      

01:03:49.393 --> 01:03:53.461
   to the class on behalf       
   of the executive council?    

01:03:55.966 --> 01:03:59.034
      (upbeat rock music)       

01:04:40.510 --> 01:04:42.444
  - [Gus] Hey, where's Belle?   

01:04:42.446 --> 01:04:44.279
    - Why don't you just        
    leave her alone already?    

01:04:44.281 --> 01:04:45.547
   - I need to talk to her,     
   do you know where she is?    

01:04:45.549 --> 01:04:47.115
      - Maybe, maybe not.       

01:04:47.117 --> 01:04:48.450
  - You know, you're            
  unbelievable. You know that?  

01:04:48.452 --> 01:04:49.885
         - You love it.         

01:04:56.159 --> 01:04:59.628
      - Hello, and welcome      
      to our school dance.      

01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:13.675
     I had a fantastic year     
     with you all here.         

01:05:13.677 --> 01:05:15.977
      There have been           
      many great moments,       

01:05:15.979 --> 01:05:17.612
     like the time when...      

01:05:21.218 --> 01:05:23.952
        (Belle sighing)         

01:05:25.289 --> 01:05:27.422
  - Alright, everybody settle   
  down for just a second.       

01:05:27.424 --> 01:05:28.456
        We'll continue.         

01:05:28.458 --> 01:05:30.158
          For now, oh,          

01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:33.361
 I'd like to thank Dear Luna    
 for so graciously being here,  

01:05:33.363 --> 01:05:34.996
     so let's go ahead          
     and give them a hand.      

01:05:34.998 --> 01:05:37.999
       (crowd applauding)       

01:05:38.001 --> 01:05:39.267
     Thank you, gentleman.      

01:05:39.269 --> 01:05:40.435
    - I'm gonna talk, I have    
    a speech and everything.    

01:05:40.437 --> 01:05:41.636
      - But Mr. Davy            
      said I could do it.       

01:05:41.638 --> 01:05:43.505
       - It's okay, I can       
       do it. I'm fine.         

01:05:43.507 --> 01:05:45.240
  - I know, but you haven't     
  been here for the meetings.   

01:05:45.242 --> 01:05:46.374
     I spent weeks on this.     

01:05:46.376 --> 01:05:47.409
 - I know, but I have to do it. 

01:05:47.411 --> 01:05:48.376
   - Why? Nobody even cares.    

01:05:48.378 --> 01:05:49.411
           - I care.            

01:05:49.413 --> 01:05:51.246
        - Well, so do I.        

01:05:51.248 --> 01:05:52.480
         - Since when?          

01:05:52.482 --> 01:05:53.281
     - Since you fell off       
     the face of the earth      

01:05:53.283 --> 01:05:54.215
     and I took your place.     

01:05:54.217 --> 01:05:56.851
 - Now, I'd like to welcome up  

01:05:56.852 --> 01:05:59.486
 your freshman class            
 president to say a few words.  

01:05:59.489 --> 01:06:02.457
       (crowd applauding)       

01:06:03.393 --> 01:06:05.593
  - Maybe next election, Lyla.  

01:06:06.730 --> 01:06:10.498
    - You know what? I'm so     
    done with this. You win.    

01:06:11.468 --> 01:06:13.568
     Thinner is the winner.     

01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:18.306
            - What?             

01:06:18.308 --> 01:06:19.374
            - Ally?             

01:06:19.376 --> 01:06:20.608
         Yeah, it's me.         

01:06:23.113 --> 01:06:24.512
            - What?             

01:06:24.514 --> 01:06:25.613
          - I'm Ally.           

01:06:30.554 --> 01:06:32.020
            Exactly.            

01:06:32.022 --> 01:06:34.155
    You can starve yourself     
    until you're nothing.       

01:06:34.157 --> 01:06:37.559
     It's all I ever wanted     
     you to be anyway.          

01:06:44.134 --> 01:06:47.102
       (crowd whispering)       

01:07:08.058 --> 01:07:10.725
     - [Voiceover Of Belle]     
     I believe in control,      

01:07:10.727 --> 01:07:12.160
  the only force mighty enough  

01:07:12.162 --> 01:07:15.663
    to bring order in the       
    chaos that is my world.     

01:07:17.167 --> 01:07:19.267
       I believe that           
       I'm the most vile,       

01:07:19.269 --> 01:07:22.804
  worthless, and useless        
  person ever to have existed   

01:07:22.806 --> 01:07:25.540
    on this planet and that     
    I am totally unworthy       

01:07:25.542 --> 01:07:28.410
of anyone's time and attention. 

01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:33.715
      I believe in oughts,      
      musts, and shoulds,       

01:07:33.717 --> 01:07:38.153
  as unbreakable laws to        
  determine my daily behavior.  

01:07:39.289 --> 01:07:43.091
    I believe in perfection     
    and strive to attain it.    

01:07:43.093 --> 01:07:46.161
     I believe in salvation     
     through starvation.        

01:07:46.163 --> 01:07:48.530
 I believe in calorie counters  
 as the inspired word of God    

01:07:48.532 --> 01:07:50.432
 and memorize them accordingly. 

01:07:50.434 --> 01:07:52.067
     I believe in bathroom      
     scales as an indicator     

01:07:52.069 --> 01:07:54.836
     of my daily successes      
     and failures.              

01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:57.806
       I believe in Hell,       
       'cause sometimes,        

01:07:57.808 --> 01:07:59.607
     I think I live in it.      

01:08:00.710 --> 01:08:04.412
     I believe in a holy        
     black and white world.     

01:08:04.414 --> 01:08:08.249
    The losing of weight,       
    recrimination for sins,     

01:08:10.387 --> 01:08:12.287
     elongation of the body     

01:08:14.424 --> 01:08:16.591
    and a life ever fasting.    

01:08:18.528 --> 01:08:20.462
       (Belle screaming)        

01:08:20.464 --> 01:08:23.465
        (photos ripping)        

01:08:49.658 --> 01:08:52.594
        (Belle sobbing)         

01:09:40.609 --> 01:09:43.344
- Let's not tell mom about this.

01:09:44.514 --> 01:09:48.416
      - You still think         
      she might come back?      

01:09:48.417 --> 01:09:49.517
        - Actually, no.         

01:09:55.458 --> 01:09:56.758
       It's okay though.        

01:10:03.366 --> 01:10:04.732
       Can I have my bag?       

01:10:12.509 --> 01:10:15.877
     - You know, you gave       
     us all quite a scare.      

01:10:22.385 --> 01:10:24.519
   - Belle, you know you're     
   not supposed to have that.   

01:10:24.521 --> 01:10:28.489
 - I'm sorry, I just wanted     
 to see if it was still there.  

01:10:28.491 --> 01:10:30.525
   - If what was still there?   

01:10:32.629 --> 01:10:34.529
     - Nothing, never mind.     

01:10:34.531 --> 01:10:35.697
    - Belle, you have           
    someone here to see you.    

01:10:35.699 --> 01:10:37.665
    Are you up for visitors?    

01:10:37.667 --> 01:10:38.566
            - Okay.             

01:10:42.739 --> 01:10:43.738
          - Hi there.           

01:10:45.809 --> 01:10:47.475
       - It's okay, Dad.        

01:10:47.477 --> 01:10:49.644
   I'm fine for now, thanks.    

01:10:57.988 --> 01:11:02.457
 - You're doing great, we just  
 don't wanna trigger a relapse. 

01:11:02.459 --> 01:11:06.861
 - But she wouldn't go through  
 this again, would she?         

01:11:06.863 --> 01:11:07.762
           - Most do.           

01:11:12.469 --> 01:11:13.868
  - What do you want from me?   

01:11:13.870 --> 01:11:14.936
          - I'm sorry.          

01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:18.606
       I'm really sorry.        

01:11:18.608 --> 01:11:20.441
     - You knew it was me.      

01:11:22.612 --> 01:11:24.445
      You knew I was Ana.       

01:11:27.884 --> 01:11:30.585
       You were the only        
       one who knew, and        

01:11:30.587 --> 01:11:32.553
   you took advantage of it.    

01:11:32.555 --> 01:11:35.823
- Everyone's a little insecure. 

01:11:35.825 --> 01:11:37.759
   I didn't know anyone took    
   it that seriously, Belle.    

01:11:37.761 --> 01:11:40.361
     I never imagined you,      
     of all people, would.      

01:11:40.363 --> 01:11:42.530
   - Then you did know, Lyla    

01:11:44.401 --> 01:11:46.868
and you pushed me even further. 

01:11:50.373 --> 01:11:53.641
    - You didn't tell anyone    
    it was me, did you?         

01:11:53.643 --> 01:11:56.477
   - Do you realize how many    
   people look up to you?       

01:11:56.479 --> 01:11:59.547
    Do you realize how many     
    followers you have?         

01:11:59.549 --> 01:12:01.783
     How many girls must        
     be doing crazy things      

01:12:01.785 --> 01:12:03.785
  because what you told them?   

01:12:03.787 --> 01:12:05.353
        What you posted?        

01:12:09.492 --> 01:12:13.728
  I mean, I don't think we      
  could ever be friends again.  

01:12:19.336 --> 01:12:20.702
       - You're so lucky.       

01:12:26.543 --> 01:12:29.043
 I could never be that skinny.  

01:12:49.833 --> 01:12:53.701
   (cell phone alert beeping)   

01:12:58.575 --> 01:13:01.809
     - [Belle's Dad]            
     Belle, dinner's ready!     

01:13:33.576 --> 01:13:34.776
  - [Belle] Smells great, dad.  

01:13:34.778 --> 01:13:35.676
             - Hey.             

01:13:37.781 --> 01:13:39.614
      I hope you like it.       

01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:45.019
             Swirl.             

01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:04.572
         Not terrible?          

01:14:26.229 --> 01:14:29.630
      - [Gus] Did you get       
      any of my messages?       

01:14:29.632 --> 01:14:33.034
     - I didn't really          
     wanna speak to anyone.     

01:14:36.506 --> 01:14:37.205
           - Figures.           

01:14:39.809 --> 01:14:41.676
      So how you feeling?       

01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:44.979
           - Better.            

01:14:47.050 --> 01:14:48.483
         - That's good.         

01:14:51.521 --> 01:14:54.689
       (girls whispering)       

01:15:24.888 --> 01:15:26.053
         - Hey, Belle.          

01:15:27.590 --> 01:15:28.689
             - Hey.             

01:15:30.660 --> 01:15:34.729
   - I received a letter        
   from the writer's program.   

01:15:35.732 --> 01:15:38.165
You didn't have to apply for me.

01:15:38.167 --> 01:15:39.066
           - I know,            

01:15:40.637 --> 01:15:44.539
    but I also know how much    
    you really wanted it.       

01:15:47.544 --> 01:15:51.112
     Sometimes, we tend to      
     get a little off-track     

01:15:51.114 --> 01:15:54.015
    and that's when we could    
    use the help of others      

01:15:54.017 --> 01:15:56.817
  to straighten us out again.   

01:15:56.819 --> 01:15:59.086
    - I'm done being on the     
    track everyone thinks       

01:15:59.088 --> 01:16:01.055
        I want to be on.        

01:16:01.057 --> 01:16:02.723
      - No, I understand.       

01:16:09.699 --> 01:16:11.065
       - I didn't get it.       

01:16:19.776 --> 01:16:21.008
         - That's okay.         

01:16:25.281 --> 01:16:26.180
           - I know.            

01:16:28.217 --> 01:16:31.285
      (slow solemn music)       

01:16:41.164 --> 01:16:42.630
     - [Voiceover Of Belle]     
     For the longest time,      

01:16:42.632 --> 01:16:45.600
    I've tried to be perfect    
    because I thought that      

01:16:45.602 --> 01:16:47.969
      making even one           
      little mistake meant      

01:16:47.971 --> 01:16:51.138
      disappointing the         
      people who love me.       

01:16:53.109 --> 01:16:56.877
  But the people who love you   
  will accept your B pluses     

01:16:56.879 --> 01:16:58.713
     and rejection letters      

01:16:58.715 --> 01:17:02.650
    just as much as your        
    presidential victories.     

01:17:10.393 --> 01:17:12.159
I guess, at the end of the day, 

01:17:12.161 --> 01:17:15.763
     I can't really say         
     who my role model is.      

01:17:16.933 --> 01:17:21.035
   Even the people we look up   
   to most, believe in most,    

01:17:21.037 --> 01:17:23.104
    disappoint us sometimes.    

01:17:25.408 --> 01:17:28.843
    But that's okay,            
    because I know my worth     

01:17:28.845 --> 01:17:30.945
   isn't measured by numbers,   

01:17:30.947 --> 01:17:34.682
    numbers of friends,         
    votes, likes, or pounds.    

01:17:37.987 --> 01:17:42.923
  If we think that way, when    
  will smart be smart enough?   

01:17:42.925 --> 01:17:45.826
       When will skinny         
       be skinny enough?        

01:17:52.735 --> 01:17:54.702
      Sometimes, you            
      have to be reminded       

01:17:54.704 --> 01:17:58.372
     to turn around and see     
     how far you've come.       

01:18:14.123 --> 01:18:18.192
  I'm Belle, I'm in recovery,   
  I'm worth something.          

01:18:21.864 --> 01:18:22.863
          We all are.
