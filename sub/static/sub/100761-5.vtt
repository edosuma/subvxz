00:07.007 --> 00:09.885
I can't think of anyone who'd make
better parents than Nikki and Jason.

00:09.968 --> 00:11.845
They are just the nicest people
in the world.

00:11.929 --> 00:13.096
Yeah, totally agree.

00:13.889 --> 00:15.766
Obviously, they'll be less nice
when they have kids.

00:15.849 --> 00:16.934
Obviously.

00:17.643 --> 00:20.229
Everyone is. I mean,
anyone can be nice without kids, right?

00:20.312 --> 00:21.313
Yeah.

00:21.396 --> 00:25.442
No, but really, they're just
amazing people. Really, really amazing.

00:25.526 --> 00:28.737
Yeah, and they're a great couple.
Really strong, really resilient.

00:28.820 --> 00:31.240
Oh, my God. So strong, so resilient.

00:32.073 --> 00:34.243
The thing to remember with them
is that they're very

00:34.326 --> 00:35.369
-strong.
-Strong.

00:36.870 --> 00:38.455
-And resilient.
-Resilient.

00:39.039 --> 00:42.292
They're just really strong and resilient.

00:42.376 --> 00:45.254
Really strong, really resilient.

00:47.297 --> 00:52.052
When she told me she was adopting,
I was like, "Bitch, this news is global."

00:52.594 --> 00:55.931
I mean, I would totally adopt.
Having a baby is gross.

00:56.014 --> 00:57.724
I mean, what if it looks like the dad?

00:57.808 --> 00:59.518
Then when you're having sex
with your husband,

00:59.601 --> 01:01.895
it's like having sex with someone
that looks like your son.

01:01.979 --> 01:04.355
I mean, that is just grim.

01:06.608 --> 01:11.738
I mean,
they're just really strong and resilient.

01:29.548 --> 01:32.092
Okay. So there's wipes
and drinks in there.

01:32.176 --> 01:33.844
I've got a new number,
so I wrote it down for you.

01:33.927 --> 01:36.096
-Yeah, no. We'll be fine.
-Thanks for doing this.

01:36.180 --> 01:38.640
No, we need the practice.
We're so flattered that you'd ask us.

01:38.724 --> 01:41.768
Oh, no, totally. It's just childcare
is crazy expensive, so...

01:43.228 --> 01:44.688
Right?

01:44.771 --> 01:47.482
-Oh, hello. Who's this?
-Snap Snap.

01:48.192 --> 01:51.570
Does she want some breakfast?
A little bit of sausage for Snap Snap?

01:51.653 --> 01:54.865
-No. She's vegan.
-All right.

01:54.948 --> 01:57.367
Snap Snap's a vegan. Good for Snap Snap.

01:57.451 --> 02:00.954
-So, where are you going today?
-Day spa at the Chilterns.

02:01.038 --> 02:02.122
-Lovely.
-Lovely.

02:02.206 --> 02:05.626
Yeah, I need to be in the countryside.
Just, you know, even for an afternoon.

02:05.709 --> 02:07.920
Be nice to see some flowers
other than on a pavement

02:08.002 --> 02:09.545
after someone's been hit by a car.

02:10.964 --> 02:12.466
Okay, so there's the number.

02:12.549 --> 02:14.635
-Okay. Great.
-I'll just put these in here.

02:15.385 --> 02:17.513
Chloe had a cold last week.
Knocked her out of it.

02:17.596 --> 02:19.598
-Oh, no.
-Oh, yeah. It was great.

02:20.849 --> 02:23.852
Don't be afraid to call.
Oh, I'll just get the buggy.

02:23.936 --> 02:27.314
Actually, I thought we'll probably
all just walk, 'cause the buggy's

02:27.397 --> 02:29.066
-a bit of a faff, isn't it?
-Yeah.

02:29.149 --> 02:30.943
Okay, if you're sure.

02:31.026 --> 02:33.153
-Yeah.
-Okay.

02:33.237 --> 02:37.032
I've written down times for food,
otherwise they get very difficult.

02:37.115 --> 02:38.200
Do they?

02:38.283 --> 02:40.911
You can be semiflexible
with the midmorning snack.

02:40.994 --> 02:44.039
Okay. I think we'll just fold them
into our day.

02:44.122 --> 02:45.958
-Yeah.
-Rather than...

02:46.583 --> 02:49.461
You know what I mean? In terms of-- Yeah.

02:50.838 --> 02:53.215
-Let me just check that number again.
-Okay, yeah.

02:58.303 --> 02:59.888
So, you're talking to his exes?

03:01.807 --> 03:03.016
All of them?

03:04.685 --> 03:06.228
And you have that sort of time?

03:17.406 --> 03:18.949
This is fun, isn't it?

03:19.032 --> 03:21.410
Much better than being
with your mum and dad.

03:22.452 --> 03:23.745
Who wants an ice cream?

03:23.829 --> 03:26.248
-Me!
-Yeah? Go on then.

03:27.541 --> 03:28.542
Really?

03:29.084 --> 03:31.461
-What? It's a special day.
-It's 10:30 in the morning.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.672
Yeah, but I want them to have
an amazing time.

03:34.715 --> 03:37.342
Plus, if you're too strict with food,
they get eating disorders.

03:37.426 --> 03:39.136
-Everyone knows that.
-Is that right, doctor?

03:41.305 --> 03:44.558
-Can I have a tutti-frutti?
-No, tutti-fruttis rot your teeth.

03:44.641 --> 03:46.518
Oh, you'll have no problems with him.

03:46.602 --> 03:48.562
I had him in the garage as a kid.

03:48.645 --> 03:52.316
If you can strip down a car
and rebuild it, you can do anything.

03:54.860 --> 03:56.570
Well, that's not true, but...

04:02.034 --> 04:03.160
Should we sit over there?

04:03.243 --> 04:04.620
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

04:08.332 --> 04:10.709
-Oh.
-Sorry.

04:13.545 --> 04:14.671
That was weird.

04:16.507 --> 04:18.675
Excuse me.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.886
This is nice, isn't it?

04:22.804 --> 04:25.724
-What? Hang on.
-What?

04:25.807 --> 04:27.100
-What?
-What?

04:28.143 --> 04:29.353
What's this?

04:30.354 --> 04:32.439
-What is that? What is it?
-What?

04:32.523 --> 04:36.276
-It looks like a treasure hunt.
-Wow!

04:36.360 --> 04:38.904
Oh, wow!

04:39.613 --> 04:46.286
It says,
"A pirate has buried his, or her, treasure

04:46.370 --> 04:49.540
somewhere in London,
and these are the clues to find it."

04:49.623 --> 04:51.625
-I wanna see, I wanna see!
-That's so exciting, isn't it?

04:51.708 --> 04:53.794
-You hold this. Don't eat it.
-All right. I won't.

04:55.295 --> 04:57.589
-What's all this?
-It's a treasure hunt.

04:57.673 --> 04:59.007
-Did you do this, yeah?
-No.

04:59.091 --> 05:01.343
-A pirate, Jason.
-How?

05:01.426 --> 05:03.470
-Who knows?
-Can I see it?

05:03.554 --> 05:05.764
Maybe the pirate got up
at 6:00 this morning and set it all up.

05:05.848 --> 05:08.976
Did you get up at 6:00 this morning
and planted all these all over London?

05:09.059 --> 05:12.521
Yes, but can you pay attention, please?
You need to follow the instructions.

05:12.604 --> 05:14.273
Don't you worry about me.
I can follow clues.

05:14.356 --> 05:17.442
Oh, really? 'Cause, I mean,
you're really not following this, are you?

05:17.526 --> 05:19.278
-All right, shall we have a little read?
-Okay, yeah.

05:19.361 --> 05:20.362
All right.

05:20.863 --> 05:26.159
"If the first clue ye wish to know,
to a big building ye must go.

05:26.243 --> 05:28.787
The queen of England lives within.

05:28.871 --> 05:33.083
-The clue is hidden by a bin/lamp post."
-A bin?

05:33.166 --> 05:36.753
Right. Where do we think that is?
A big building where the queen lives.

05:36.837 --> 05:40.048
-Buckingham Palace! Yes!
-Okay! All right!

05:45.262 --> 05:46.555
That's amazing.

05:48.056 --> 05:51.727
So, let me get this clear, right?
So, it's a pirate's treasure?

05:51.810 --> 05:52.811
Yes.

05:52.895 --> 05:56.064
And he's buried it and left clues?

05:56.148 --> 05:57.191
Yes.

05:57.274 --> 05:59.193
But if he's buried it
and he knows where it is...

05:59.276 --> 06:02.362
-Yeah, but the clues are for us.
-Why does he want us to find it?

06:02.946 --> 06:04.948
You're really overthinking this, Jase.

06:05.824 --> 06:07.117
Nikki's the best.

06:07.201 --> 06:10.078
I mean, I've never really known
anyone old before,

06:10.162 --> 06:12.206
'cause I thought
it would be really boring.

06:12.289 --> 06:14.082
But she's not like other old people,

06:14.166 --> 06:16.460
'cause she doesn't really
have her life together yet.

06:16.543 --> 06:19.630
Like, she doesn't have a mortgage,
or money or a good career.

06:19.713 --> 06:24.718
And she's still quite young, mentally,
so she can just be a really good laugh.

06:27.179 --> 06:28.764
Wait. Did I say the wrong thing?

06:29.598 --> 06:34.019
I mean, don't worry, she's great.
She's basically exactly like me.

06:39.650 --> 06:42.569
-Look at that. It's Buckingham Palace.
-Wow!

06:42.653 --> 06:43.654
-Wow!
-Right. Okay.

06:43.737 --> 06:46.698
So, if there's a bin, there's a lamppost,

06:46.782 --> 06:48.158
-you think maybe it's over there?
-Yeah!

06:48.242 --> 06:49.952
-Do you wanna have a look?
-Go on. Have a look.

06:51.537 --> 06:53.664
Did you see how she hugged me
when she fell over?

06:53.747 --> 06:56.834
-Yeah.
-Quite like it when they're upset.

06:57.584 --> 07:00.003
-Means they need you more. Is that bad?
-Yeah.

07:00.087 --> 07:02.464
-Don't see it.
-How we getting on then? Any luck?

07:02.548 --> 07:03.549
-Don't see it.
-No.

07:03.632 --> 07:04.842
You can't?

07:04.925 --> 07:07.302
-It's not inside the bin.
-Are you looking hard enough?

07:07.386 --> 07:08.971
Where could it be? Where could it be?

07:09.721 --> 07:11.390
-What?
-I found it!

07:11.473 --> 07:12.933
-Oh, my goodness!
-No, you haven't--

07:13.016 --> 07:15.853
-Yes! Yay!
-Mate, don't wave it about.

07:15.936 --> 07:18.438
Don't wave it about. We're in London.
Someone might have it away.

07:18.522 --> 07:21.066
This is treasure we got here.
Right, give it to Nikki. Come on.

07:21.149 --> 07:22.860
-Oh, wow.
-What?

07:24.653 --> 07:28.490
-"Now the second clue ye have found"...
-You like saying the word "ye," don't you?

07:28.574 --> 07:32.286
-"Now the second clue ye have found...
-And again.

07:32.369 --> 07:35.163
-...to the third ye must be bound.
-See?

07:35.247 --> 07:37.916
But don't worry, it's not far.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.753
Look for a square named Trafalgar."

07:42.337 --> 07:44.047
Now, where do we think that could be?

07:44.131 --> 07:46.675
Where do we think
the Jamaican pirate's put it, guys?

07:48.302 --> 07:50.220
Maybe--
I don't know, maybe Trafalgar Square?

07:50.304 --> 07:52.389
Trafalgar Square! Trafalgar Square!

07:52.472 --> 07:54.808
-Yeah, Trafalgar Square!
-It's gotta be. Oh, my God! Where is it?

07:54.892 --> 07:57.561
-It is!
-Let's have a look. Come on. Let's go.

07:59.271 --> 08:01.315
What do we think the treasure is?

08:01.398 --> 08:02.941
A puppy.

08:03.025 --> 08:04.359
-This is gonna end well.
-Yeah.

08:04.902 --> 08:05.986
Come on then! Let's go!

08:06.612 --> 08:10.199
Infertility is a really hard thing
to come to terms with.

08:11.408 --> 08:14.661
When you've had your heart set on a baby,
when you've wanted it for so long

08:14.745 --> 08:18.332
and waited for so long,
and then it doesn't happen, well...

08:19.666 --> 08:21.376
that's really tough to take.

08:24.296 --> 08:26.715
But life goes on.

08:30.719 --> 08:33.514
I think she meant,
was it hard for Nikki and Jason?

08:34.681 --> 08:36.433
Right.

08:38.143 --> 08:41.480
Well, yes, for them too, of course.

08:43.106 --> 08:47.069
-Look at that amazing fountain!
-Well done, kids. They found it.

08:47.152 --> 08:50.614
-Yeah. So fast. Amazing.
-Tower Bridge.

08:50.697 --> 08:52.074
-Really?
-Yeah, why?

08:52.157 --> 08:54.660
Well, it's miles away, innit?
And he needs the toilet.

08:57.162 --> 08:59.873
There's some in the National Gallery.
It's free to get in.

08:59.957 --> 09:01.500
Oh, right. Okay, cool.

09:05.546 --> 09:07.506
What? Do you want me to? Or are you gonna?

09:07.589 --> 09:09.216
I think it's best if you go.

09:09.675 --> 09:12.553
-What?
-Well, is he-- Like, do I need to--

09:12.970 --> 09:15.597
-Is he independent, or...
-What are you talking about?

09:15.681 --> 09:17.641
-Do I need to help him?
-Help what?

09:17.724 --> 09:20.352
Help him aim it, or can he aim it?

09:20.727 --> 09:22.604
-He's six. I think he can aim it.
-Yeah.

09:23.397 --> 09:25.858
-I thought so. I'll have a--
-No. Maybe don't google that, Jase.

09:25.941 --> 09:27.359
Yeah. No.

09:28.277 --> 09:29.736
-Just let him lead.
-Okay.

09:29.820 --> 09:32.698
-And let him ask for help if he needs it.
-Yeah. I...

09:33.115 --> 09:35.158
-Must be so weird.
-What?

09:35.242 --> 09:38.662
We're gonna be getting a little person
and immediately be doing all this stuff.

09:38.745 --> 09:39.830
Yeah.

09:39.913 --> 09:42.291
Never seen anyone naked
that soon after meeting them.

09:43.417 --> 09:44.501
Yeah, you have.

09:45.836 --> 09:47.129
Oh, yeah. I have.

09:49.882 --> 09:51.592
They're also really trustworthy,
aren't they?

09:51.675 --> 09:53.385
Oh, yeah. Really trustworthy.

09:53.468 --> 09:55.470
I mean, we'd be happy
to leave our kids with them.

09:55.554 --> 09:58.265
-Oh, yeah.
-You know, if we ever went out.

09:59.224 --> 10:01.310
-We go out.
-Do we?

10:01.393 --> 10:02.519
Yeah.

10:03.478 --> 10:05.647
He works late quite a lot, so...

10:06.023 --> 10:07.274
Not a lot.

10:10.277 --> 10:13.071
-Come on, everyone! Roll up!
-This the quickest way?

10:13.155 --> 10:14.406
-Yes, definitely.
-Okay.

10:14.489 --> 10:16.074
-I think.
-London's oldest dungeon!

10:16.158 --> 10:18.243
-Where are the kids?
-What? I thought you were watching them.

10:18.327 --> 10:20.287
-You were supposed to be watching them!
-Where are they?

10:20.370 --> 10:21.538
-They're just there.
-Oh, no!

10:21.622 --> 10:22.915
I tagged you.

10:22.998 --> 10:24.291
-Did you enjoy that?
-Yeah.

10:24.374 --> 10:25.626
-I hope you enjoyed that.
-Very much.

10:25.709 --> 10:27.586
Because that is the last time
you will get to do that.

10:27.669 --> 10:29.379
-I got it.
-Come and see The Dungeon Experience!

10:29.463 --> 10:31.423
Oh, shit.
No. Kids, we're not going in there!

10:31.507 --> 10:33.383
Hell no! Not at those prices.

10:33.467 --> 10:35.010
-Okay. I'll go get them.
-All right.

10:35.093 --> 10:36.929
No. Come on, guys.
We're not going in there.

10:37.012 --> 10:40.390
-Twenty-one pounds each.
-Sorry, not today.

10:40.474 --> 10:43.268
Hi. Come on. Don't you wanna carry on
with the treasure hunt?

10:43.352 --> 10:44.353
-No.
-Roll up!

10:44.436 --> 10:46.647
-No!
-Oh, come on. Please, it'll be fun.

10:46.730 --> 10:47.981
Hello, poppet.

10:48.065 --> 10:51.652
-Here we go.
-Yeah, it's me. Mrs. Hannigan.

10:52.361 --> 10:55.948
Wrongfully imprisoned here in 1842.

10:56.031 --> 10:58.075
-Really?
-Okay. Well, you're not helping massively.

10:58.158 --> 11:00.577
-Don't you want to find the next clue?
-No.

11:03.163 --> 11:06.667
Mean mummy. You take a leaflet.

11:07.334 --> 11:09.586
-They said, "No."
-What do you mean, they said, "No"?

11:09.670 --> 11:11.171
They said, "No."

11:11.255 --> 11:13.590
-You can't ask. You got to tell.
-All right, be my guest.

11:13.674 --> 11:16.677
It's not a negotiation, is it?
They're little kids, not a man with a gun.

11:20.264 --> 11:22.391
-Two adults, two children, please.
-Sure.

11:22.474 --> 11:24.476
So, that'll be £75.60.

11:24.560 --> 11:27.062
And would you like an audio guide
with that? Six pounds extra.

11:27.145 --> 11:28.897
-That sounds lovely.
-No.

11:32.359 --> 11:35.696
Welcome to The Dungeon Experience.

11:35.779 --> 11:38.824
It's a long way down
to the torture chamber.

11:38.907 --> 11:42.035
But don't worry.
If you get tired at the bottom,

11:42.119 --> 11:45.873
you can always have
a nice lie-down on the rack,

11:45.956 --> 11:48.292
until your joints dislocate,

11:48.375 --> 11:52.588
your flesh tears apart
and your insides spill out!

11:55.174 --> 11:56.550
For goodness' sake.

11:56.633 --> 11:58.510
-Come back, kids. Sam?
-Nice one, mate.

11:59.136 --> 12:01.013
-I'm so sorry. It was...
-Come back.

12:01.096 --> 12:02.431
Chloe!

12:03.098 --> 12:06.018
-Rest of you, come with me.
-Less than five minutes.

12:07.561 --> 12:09.521
-I want my mummy.
-It's okay.

12:09.605 --> 12:12.149
It's okay. He was a nasty man, wasn't he?

12:12.232 --> 12:14.860
Yeah, thanks for nothing.
He's not having it.

12:14.943 --> 12:17.905
I mean, that's £75 a minute. That's what
bankers pay to go to real dungeons

12:17.988 --> 12:19.615
and have people actually torture 'em.

12:19.698 --> 12:22.159
-I'm hungry.
-Are you, mate?

12:22.868 --> 12:25.287
I think there was
a fish and chip place over there.

12:25.370 --> 12:29.875
No, I've hidden a clue at Borough Market.
It's got food from all over the world.

12:29.958 --> 12:33.504
Yeah, yeah. 'Cause kids much prefer
Ethiopian street food to fish and chips.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.173
Come here.

12:36.924 --> 12:39.468
Come on. They're starving.
Let's just go down there and have a look.

12:39.551 --> 12:42.095
You all right? Want me to carry you?

12:42.179 --> 12:44.765
Do you want to carry-- Yeah,
let's not forget this little bag here.

12:45.390 --> 12:46.850
It's just about priorities really.

12:46.934 --> 12:50.354
-If I work hard, it's for us.
-We have enough. You work for you.

12:50.437 --> 12:52.856
I would just like to have something
to show for my life.

12:52.940 --> 12:55.150
-You have two children.
-Everyone has children.

12:56.235 --> 12:58.153
Not everyone's a company director aged 38.

12:58.237 --> 12:59.530
Okay. Wow.

12:59.613 --> 13:01.573
You know what?
Most men do much less than me.

13:01.657 --> 13:04.076
-Sean doesn't do pickups or drop-offs.
-Yeah, I'm very lucky.

13:04.159 --> 13:06.495
Look, just could be worse,
that's all I'm saying.

13:06.578 --> 13:08.789
-Chris, Omar and Jason--
-Very lucky girl.

13:08.872 --> 13:11.875
Jason, he works
way more antisocial hours than me,

13:11.959 --> 13:13.335
doesn't earn a third as much.

13:16.713 --> 13:17.840
Okay.

13:18.507 --> 13:21.134
-Okay. That's quite annoying.
-You're gonna hurt yourselves.

13:21.218 --> 13:22.219
All right. Okay. Thank you.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.346
Excuse me. Hi. Hello.
Can we have some menus, please?

13:24.429 --> 13:27.015
And we're not tourists, so if we can have
the ones with the real prices,

13:27.099 --> 13:29.476
-that'd be great. Thank you.
-Yeah, sure.

13:29.560 --> 13:32.020
-Okay. Yeah. Listen, that's annoying.
-So cute.

13:32.104 --> 13:34.773
Yes, sometimes.
Cute little monsters more like.

13:34.857 --> 13:36.900
That's enough of that. Thank you.

13:36.984 --> 13:38.694
This is Chloe and this is Sam.

13:38.777 --> 13:40.195
-Hi.
-Say hello.

13:41.864 --> 13:43.699
I wish you wouldn't speak
to the waiters all the time.

13:43.782 --> 13:45.534
-That means you have to leave a tip.
-Don't be so tight.

13:45.617 --> 13:47.619
That was a £9 conversation you just had.

13:48.829 --> 13:50.873
Whoa! Careful! Sorry.

13:50.956 --> 13:52.124
Come on.

13:53.625 --> 13:54.710
-Was that--
-Wow.

13:54.793 --> 13:57.379
-Dude, don't spit everywhere.
-Hey, mate. Please.

13:57.462 --> 13:59.464
That's naughty, mate. All right?

13:59.923 --> 14:02.259
What? Why are you crying?

14:03.510 --> 14:05.846
I mean, literally nothing has happened.

14:05.929 --> 14:09.641
Come on. Come on. Don't cry. Come on.

14:09.725 --> 14:13.729
A time she has overcome adversity...

14:14.563 --> 14:16.523
Well, I mean-- That's-

14:16.607 --> 14:18.901
I mean, that's the great thing
about Nikki, isn't it?

14:18.984 --> 14:21.111
You know, she finds everything difficult.

14:22.696 --> 14:27.409
Which is a good thing, you know,
because she just keeps on going.

14:28.410 --> 14:30.537
That's people, though, isn't it?
You know, some people.

14:30.621 --> 14:32.873
I mean, stressed all the time.

14:33.790 --> 14:36.376
I don't do that. Stress is a toxin.

14:37.002 --> 14:39.505
Body can't process it.
It is the lactose of the mind.

14:39.588 --> 14:42.382
Babe, she doesn't get stressed.

14:44.635 --> 14:46.553
She had that big panic attack
in Whole Foods.

14:46.637 --> 14:50.098
Well... there was a lot going on.

14:51.099 --> 14:53.143
Work was a nightmare.

14:54.102 --> 14:57.022
She was growing out this pixie cut.
It was a difficult time.

14:58.357 --> 14:59.691
And it wasn't that big.

15:00.776 --> 15:02.736
Bit of hyperventilating.

15:04.363 --> 15:07.366
It's quite a good place
for it, actually, innit?

15:07.449 --> 15:09.743
You know, 'cause all their bags
are made of paper.

15:11.537 --> 15:14.414
-Let's sit down now, guys. Let's sit down.
-Guys, come on. Please, sit down.

15:14.498 --> 15:17.459
-I think we should probably just go.
-Look! There's some chocolate cake!

15:17.543 --> 15:20.754
Look, there's some chocolate cake.
Why don't we all sit down?

15:21.171 --> 15:23.966
Yeah. Sit down and we can have
some nice, lovely chocolate cake.

15:24.049 --> 15:26.677
-Chocolate cake? It's full of sugar.
-Have you got any better ideas?

15:26.760 --> 15:30.180
-They hardly touched their dinner.
-Look. It's got caramel in the middle.

15:30.264 --> 15:33.100
Yeah, well, it's £6.50.
So, unless there's £4.50 in the middle...

15:33.183 --> 15:35.185
I'd really like us
not to fall into these patterns.

15:35.269 --> 15:36.395
What patterns?

15:36.478 --> 15:38.063
Me having to battle
every time I want to treat them.

15:38.146 --> 15:39.982
A treat's not a treat
if it's all the time, is it?

15:40.065 --> 15:42.359
-I'm not depriving our kids, Jason.
-What do you mean, deprive?

15:42.442 --> 15:44.736
They're not deprived.
Kids in Syria are deprived.

15:44.820 --> 15:46.822
I'd like to buy chocolate cake
for everyone in Syria,

15:46.905 --> 15:48.532
but that's just not practical, is it?

15:48.615 --> 15:51.159
Hello. Could I just have
a couple of chocolate cakes please?

15:51.243 --> 15:53.412
Hiya. Could we box those up to go,
as well, please?

15:53.954 --> 15:56.290
Eighteen quid. She's off again.

15:56.790 --> 15:59.334
No. Come on, Chloe.
No, no. Oh, don't do--

16:02.546 --> 16:05.132
Yeah, well, she has
a developmental disorder actually, so...

16:06.550 --> 16:09.261
-God, I'm so sorry.
-Yeah. Well.

16:10.179 --> 16:12.848
Come on. Come on.
Let's sit down. Good girl.

16:16.894 --> 16:19.730
-Does she?
-No. But I will not have her judged.

16:22.941 --> 16:25.027
She's just a very strong woman.

16:25.527 --> 16:27.070
You wouldn't mess with her.

16:27.154 --> 16:28.614
And bright as a button.

16:28.697 --> 16:30.073
What's that word you used?

16:31.450 --> 16:33.577
-Infectious.
-"Infectious."

16:33.660 --> 16:35.537
She's infectious.

16:35.621 --> 16:37.873
You couldn't have picked
a better match for Jason.

16:38.707 --> 16:42.211
Yeah. We were sorry to see Jane go.

16:44.254 --> 16:46.840
But these things happen,
and he's with Nikki now, so...

16:49.051 --> 16:50.677
-And we love Nikki.
-Yeah.

16:50.761 --> 16:51.845
Yes.

16:57.226 --> 17:00.145
Oh, and we won't need this one.

17:01.021 --> 17:02.689
We don't have an ethnicity.

17:07.194 --> 17:09.404
Lovely. Oh, look. Band's broken up again.

17:09.488 --> 17:11.240
Come on, guys! Keep up, hey!

17:12.574 --> 17:15.160
Sort of thought
they'd be more into the treasure hunt.

17:15.993 --> 17:18.413
Tracking down the clues,
working stuff out.

17:19.039 --> 17:20.540
That sounds like '80s kids.

17:21.500 --> 17:23.252
What was the-- What is the treasure?

17:23.335 --> 17:28.048
-It's a really great empowering message.
-Oh, they'll love that. Yeah.

17:28.131 --> 17:29.341
And a bag of sweets.

17:30.676 --> 17:33.220
Look, why don't we call it
and get 'em home, hey?

17:33.303 --> 17:35.472
-I mean, they're knackered.
-No, Jase. Really?

17:36.431 --> 17:38.058
So, that was our special day?

17:38.141 --> 17:41.478
Listen, you've gone about taping packages
to five London landmarks. All right?

17:41.562 --> 17:43.730
So just be grateful you haven't been shot.

17:43.814 --> 17:45.065
All right?

17:45.148 --> 17:47.192
-I just want to do one more thing.
-Like what?

17:47.276 --> 17:50.737
I don't know.
Just something really amazing.

17:56.535 --> 17:59.454
Oh, no. Come on, they'll love it.

17:59.538 --> 18:01.164
-Do you wanna go on the London Eye?
-Yeah!

18:01.248 --> 18:02.708
Yeah? See? See?

18:02.791 --> 18:04.960
'Course they're gonna.
They say yes to everything.

18:05.043 --> 18:06.044
Come on.

18:21.476 --> 18:22.769
Thank you.

18:22.853 --> 18:25.022
-Go and get a seat. Get a seat.
-Sit down there. Good boy.

18:25.105 --> 18:26.231
Good girl.

18:28.567 --> 18:31.486
-Oh, wow. This is exciting.
-This is exciting, innit? Yeah.

18:33.572 --> 18:35.699
Oh, wow. This is amazing!

18:35.782 --> 18:37.910
Look how high we're going.

18:37.993 --> 18:40.704
Oh, look, there's Buckingham Palace.
We were there earlier.

18:41.747 --> 18:43.498
And that's the Houses of Parliament.

18:43.582 --> 18:46.001
It's where people make decisions
about the country.

18:47.252 --> 18:48.629
Well, sometimes.

18:49.922 --> 18:52.758
And that big round building there is...

18:54.551 --> 18:56.512
I always get those confused.

18:58.388 --> 19:01.683
Oh, is that-- Yeah, you're probably right.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think that is it.

19:03.227 --> 19:04.895
What's that big round building there?

19:06.188 --> 19:07.606
St. Paul's.

19:09.149 --> 19:10.400
They would've loved this.

19:15.239 --> 19:17.491
-We are gonna go and wake them up, right?
-God, yeah.

19:25.082 --> 19:27.709
-Come on. You're missing all the fun.
-Come have a look. Come on.

19:28.460 --> 19:30.838
-Should I show you where we were before?
-Big Ben!

19:30.921 --> 19:34.424
So we dated for three years,
and then he broke up with me,

19:35.092 --> 19:36.552
then got together with Nikki.

19:37.845 --> 19:39.221
In that order.

19:40.138 --> 19:44.560
It was just one of those
classic six-year rebound flings...

19:46.270 --> 19:47.938
where you end up adopting kids.

19:49.147 --> 19:50.732
But I don't really know Nikki.

19:51.650 --> 19:53.652
Just online stuff.

19:54.361 --> 19:55.779
But she seems nice.

19:56.780 --> 19:59.408
Kind of Etsy. Not my thing.

20:00.409 --> 20:03.495
Not every jumper needs to have
a fox on it. Do you know what I mean?

20:03.912 --> 20:06.415
But I'm sure she's great.

20:06.498 --> 20:09.001
And he seems happy.

20:12.379 --> 20:13.630
-You all right?
-Yeah.

20:13.714 --> 20:14.798
-Yeah?
-Fine.

20:16.842 --> 20:19.011
Spend all day wanting them to be quiet,

20:19.094 --> 20:21.805
then when they are,
you immediately miss them.

20:21.889 --> 20:25.058
Yeah, I know.
Self-preservation this, mate.

20:25.142 --> 20:28.604
They fall asleep three minutes
before you lose patience and abandon them,

20:28.687 --> 20:34.359
and then they look so sweet and adorable
that you forget how unbearable they were.

20:34.776 --> 20:37.112
Then it happens the next day,
then 7,000 more times,

20:37.196 --> 20:40.157
and then you drive them to university.

20:41.074 --> 20:42.826
-Sounds fun.
-Yeah, sounds great.

21:01.470 --> 21:02.471
Hi.

21:05.098 --> 21:07.267
Well, come in. Come on in.

21:09.811 --> 21:12.481
There were only two children,
weren't there? I can't--

21:13.315 --> 21:14.399
Yeah.

21:16.318 --> 21:19.488
-So, how long have they been asleep?
-Oh, not long.

21:20.405 --> 21:22.366
About 45.

21:24.743 --> 21:26.703
-Four to five minutes.
-Yeah.

21:26.787 --> 21:27.996
-Okay.
-About five minutes.

21:28.080 --> 21:30.958
Okay. Sweetheart. Wake up, sweetheart.

21:31.792 --> 21:32.835
How was the spa?

21:32.918 --> 21:35.420
Well, it was 300 quid,
and it smelled like a dentist's, so...

21:35.504 --> 21:37.047
-Lovely.
-Sweetheart, wake up.

21:37.130 --> 21:38.465
-Time to wake up, darling.
-Here you go.

21:38.549 --> 21:40.092
Oh, no, you're okay, mate. Rush.

21:40.175 --> 21:43.262
Mate, I know my kids. Have a beer.

21:44.179 --> 21:45.889
Lovely. Thanks.

22:29.600 --> 22:31.185
-Is that a good book?
-Yeah.

22:31.268 --> 22:32.269
Yeah.

22:35.063 --> 22:36.982
-What's the matter?
-Nothing. I'm reading my book.

22:37.065 --> 22:39.401
It's not the end of the world
if it wasn't the perfect day.

22:39.484 --> 22:41.612
-Yeah. No, I know.
-You know, I...

22:43.906 --> 22:46.950
I just think maybe you tried
a little bit too hard, that's all.

22:49.161 --> 22:50.162
Yeah.

22:51.747 --> 22:54.041
Or maybe you weren't trying hard enough.

22:55.959 --> 22:58.462
We need to learn to bond with children.
If we couldn't bond with them, then--

22:58.545 --> 23:02.049
But we're never gonna bond with them
in the way that we will with ours, are we?

23:02.132 --> 23:03.467
-Why?
-Because they're not our kids.

23:03.550 --> 23:06.094
They're someone else's kids
who miss their mum and dad.

23:06.178 --> 23:09.973
Yeah. Jason, that is exactly
who our kids are gonna be.

23:10.057 --> 23:13.268
Someone else's kids
who miss their mum and dad.

23:13.352 --> 23:15.479
And it's gonna be a lot harder
than today was.

23:15.562 --> 23:17.731
They might not even like us.
They might not even wanna talk to us.

23:17.814 --> 23:20.943
And we're gonna have to deal with
all of that, whether we like it or not.

23:22.236 --> 23:24.196
And just so you know,
I am gonna be trying hard.

23:24.279 --> 23:28.325
I am gonna be trying really hard
because we're gonna have to.

23:29.284 --> 23:33.121
And I cannot have you standing behind me,
tutting and rolling your eyes.

23:33.205 --> 23:34.998
-Okay?
-Yeah.

23:36.291 --> 23:38.293
Your mum is gonna be doing enough of that.

24:39.104 --> 24:42.024
Ice cream! I want my ice cream!

24:42.107 --> 24:44.234
Penguin wants ice cream!

25:38.330 --> 25:40.499
-How long have you been there for?
-About an hour.

25:49.758 --> 25:50.843
Nikki?
