00:16.813 --> 00:18.356
You're gonna like my room.

00:18.482 --> 00:21.399
You can see the entire Strip from my balcony.

00:21.526 --> 00:23.519
And the bed.

00:25.364 --> 00:27.356
I usually don't do this.

00:27.491 --> 00:30.242
I mean, especially with somebody that I just met.

00:30.369 --> 00:32.907
Yeah? I could tell that just by looking at you.

00:33.038 --> 00:35.031
(Elevator pings)

00:37.668 --> 00:39.660
Come on. Don't worry.

00:39.795 --> 00:41.787
All right? You can trust me.

00:41.922 --> 00:44.958
- OK?
- Promise?

00:45.092 --> 00:47.084
I never lie.

00:49.096 --> 00:50.887
You...

00:51.014 --> 00:52.806
are so bad.

00:53.934 --> 00:56.259
Yeah. I am.

01:09.366 --> 01:11.359
Hey.

01:11.493 --> 01:13.486
Dispatch says "suspicious circs".

01:13.620 --> 01:14.865
Yeah.

01:14.997 --> 01:18.366
An anonymous called 911
at the same time the couple found him.

01:18.500 --> 01:20.493
A male voice said,

01:20.627 --> 01:23.545
"A man has collapsed at the Devon. Hurry."

01:23.672 --> 01:26.957
- Where's the man?
- He's unconscious, but breathing.

01:27.092 --> 01:29.844
So paramedics took him
to Desert Palm Hospital.

01:29.970 --> 01:32.128
No bullet wounds, no knife, nothing.

01:32.264 --> 01:35.467
- You got a name?
- Bob Fairmont. Upscale home developer.

01:35.601 --> 01:38.804
"A Fairmont home, you'll never roam"?
His billboards are everywhere.

01:38.937 --> 01:41.642
They took these pictures before they moved him.

01:46.570 --> 01:49.571
Well, this is as phoney
as a Chappaquiddick neck brace.

01:49.698 --> 01:51.691
See how the clothes are all bunched?

01:51.825 --> 01:54.233
Collar's off to the side. Leg fabric's gathered.

01:54.369 --> 01:58.497
It's impossible to re-dress an unconscious
person to look like they dressed themselves.

01:59.833 --> 02:02.502
Notice anything about the suit coat?

02:03.545 --> 02:05.502
Unless he's going to court or church

02:05.631 --> 02:08.466
there's no way he buttons all three buttons.

02:08.592 --> 02:10.584
Very good, Jim.

02:10.719 --> 02:12.842
Why do they think they can fool us?

02:47.172 --> 02:50.541
I'm gonna go to the hospital
and talk to Fairmont's wife.

02:50.676 --> 02:52.668
Call me if you learn anything.

02:52.803 --> 02:54.380
Hey, guys.

02:54.513 --> 02:57.218
I just pulled the manager out of a restaurant.

02:57.349 --> 02:59.472
Bob Fairmont was staying in room 292T.

03:00.644 --> 03:02.435
Catherine's parking the car.

03:02.562 --> 03:03.725
Let's go up.

03:03.855 --> 03:04.887
We'll meet you there.

03:05.023 --> 03:06.897
OK.

03:14.783 --> 03:17.155
Mr Fairmont was staying in Murder Central.

03:17.286 --> 03:19.243
Murder Central?

03:19.371 --> 03:23.072
- You never heard that phrase?
- If I did, would I have asked the question?

03:23.208 --> 03:26.244
Sara, you're with me in here.
You guys get the elevator.

03:27.838 --> 03:29.830
- All yours, girl.
- Thanks.

03:33.468 --> 03:37.003
Sara doesn't know what Murder Central means
any more than I do.

03:37.139 --> 03:39.131
Oh, Nick, give it up.

03:39.266 --> 03:41.223
We got a death imminent to worry about.

03:42.394 --> 03:45.929
My husband's in surgery. Can't this wait?

03:46.064 --> 03:49.398
I'm sorry. No. He was found
under suspicious circumstances.

03:49.526 --> 03:52.527
Do you have any idea
who may have re-dressed him or moved him?

03:52.654 --> 03:55.192
He usually goes with women
who look a lot like me.

03:55.324 --> 03:57.233
Only younger.

03:59.077 --> 04:02.612
And I'm embarrassed to say
that I've been flattered by that at times.

04:02.748 --> 04:04.206
Do you have a name?

04:05.375 --> 04:08.412
I was very much
on the outside of that part of his life.

04:10.380 --> 04:12.040
I see.

04:21.475 --> 04:23.467
I know. The room's talking to us.

04:24.645 --> 04:26.637
They had champagne.

04:26.772 --> 04:28.764
They were celebrating something.

04:34.780 --> 04:36.819
No lipstick on either glass.

04:36.949 --> 04:39.784
911 did say it was a man's voice
that placed the call

04:42.579 --> 04:44.619
Smell the musk?

04:44.748 --> 04:46.326
Hint of bleach

04:50.128 --> 04:52.168
Sexual intercourse.

04:54.633 --> 04:56.625
They kept the drapes open.

04:56.760 --> 04:59.678
A married man who's not worried about...

04:59.805 --> 05:02.260
photographs, long lenses.

05:02.391 --> 05:04.383
Well, he's either careless or...

05:04.518 --> 05:06.807
arrogant, maybe.

05:06.937 --> 05:08.479
Or he has a death wish.

05:16.905 --> 05:18.898
34C.

05:20.284 --> 05:22.656
If he was with a woman,

05:22.786 --> 05:25.194
who was the guy on the 911 call?

05:27.249 --> 05:28.957
Hand me that magnifier.

05:29.084 --> 05:31.077
Thank you.

05:32.212 --> 05:33.790
What have you got?

05:33.922 --> 05:35.666
See those white speck s?

05:39.261 --> 05:41.253
What do you think? Cocaine?

05:41.388 --> 05:43.381
No, I don't think so.

05:44.516 --> 05:46.141
How can you tell just by looking?

05:48.312 --> 05:50.138
Never you mind.

05:57.029 --> 05:59.021
Let's just get this to Trace.

06:04.244 --> 06:07.364
OK. We're done in the elevator.
You guys need a hand?

06:07.497 --> 06:09.786
Do you want to dust the champagne bottle?

06:10.959 --> 06:15.751
The average American hotel room
is covered with stains invisible to the naked eye.

06:16.882 --> 06:18.791
Yeah, but they're not all biological.

06:18.926 --> 06:22.259
Some are soda stains,
food stains, whisky stains. You know.

06:22.387 --> 06:25.139
No matter how clean or expensive
the room seems,

06:25.265 --> 06:27.935
that's why I always travel with Nonoxynol-9.

06:28.060 --> 06:30.467
You sound like you're making a commercial.

06:30.604 --> 06:32.680
Nick, hit the lights, will you?

06:35.943 --> 06:38.350
OK. We're looking for the freshest stains.

06:39.488 --> 06:41.480
Soda, maybe.

06:41.615 --> 06:43.607
Maybe champagne.

06:43.742 --> 06:45.402
Someone's little soldiers.

06:45.535 --> 06:47.113
Not fresh

06:47.245 --> 06:48.905
Dry

06:50.082 --> 06:52.074
More champagne.

06:59.508 --> 07:00.919
Hmm

07:01.051 --> 07:03.968
Starlight, star bright, first star I see tonight.

07:06.515 --> 07:07.677
OK.

07:07.808 --> 07:09.800
I'll let you guys do the collection.

07:09.935 --> 07:12.058
Oh. Thanks a lot.

07:12.187 --> 07:13.646
Oh, and, Sara.

07:15.065 --> 07:19.561
Last hotel room nearest the stairwell.
Easy entry and egress for an intruder.

07:19.695 --> 07:23.988
And if the victim fights back,
50% less chance of being heard.

07:25.158 --> 07:27.649
Rooms only on one side. Murder Central.

07:35.210 --> 07:37.666
You are so busted.

07:52.477 --> 07:55.478
- I gave this to Trace. Why do you have it?
- Because I deal in DNA

07:56.648 --> 07:58.937
The smallest sliver of epidermal tissue.

07:59.067 --> 08:01.060
- This is skin?
- Scalp skin.

08:03.196 --> 08:06.150
Itchy. Can be embarrassing in social situations,

08:06.283 --> 08:08.856
especially if one is wearing a dark shirt.

08:08.994 --> 08:10.821
Dandruff.

08:11.997 --> 08:14.867
Good chance
whoever moved the guy into the elevator...

08:15.000 --> 08:17.408
had a bad case of seborrhoea.

08:18.545 --> 08:20.538
Thanks.

08:22.174 --> 08:25.543
Hey, Catherine.
Do you think Sara would ever go out with me?

08:25.677 --> 08:27.670
Sure.

08:27.804 --> 08:30.011
As long as you don't tell her it's a date.

08:31.308 --> 08:32.885
Hey Cath?

08:33.018 --> 08:35.010
Are you on this Fairmont case?

08:35.145 --> 08:37.268
House mogul caught with his pants on? Yeah.

08:37.397 --> 08:40.067
I'm just rolling to the hospital
to get his clothes. Why?

08:40.192 --> 08:43.027
The Fairmont house
was one of my first calls three years ago.

08:43.153 --> 08:45.146
Are you serious? For what?

08:45.280 --> 08:48.234
Shots fired. He shot himself
while he was cleaning his gun.

08:48.367 --> 08:50.075
- Wow!
- Yeah.

08:51.203 --> 08:54.157
After tonight,
I'm wondering if that's what really happened.

08:54.289 --> 08:56.365
I'm gonna pull his file and check it out.

08:56.500 --> 08:57.780
Let me know.

08:57.918 --> 08:59.198
I will.

08:59.336 --> 09:00.996
Nice shot.

09:02.172 --> 09:04.165
Reservoir's still wet.

09:04.299 --> 09:06.091
Why did he throw it?

09:06.218 --> 09:08.009
I'm only impressed if he aimed.

09:08.136 --> 09:11.387
I wonder if the woman has any idea
she left her DNA behind.

09:11.515 --> 09:14.266
Not rocket science.
The man's inside, the woman's out.

09:16.311 --> 09:18.981
Wife says the guy's a player.
She doesn't know the women.

09:19.106 --> 09:20.897
Did you tell her about the 911 tape?

09:21.024 --> 09:25.437
The male voice? I just got back from Central
Dispatch. The tape's lost. New computer system.

09:25.570 --> 09:27.148
Any earwitnesses?

09:27.281 --> 09:30.235
The dispatcher says
it could have been a woman whispering.

09:30.367 --> 09:34.068
Or a very old person, gender indeterminate.

09:34.204 --> 09:36.113
That's about as good as an eyewitness.

09:36.248 --> 09:38.240
(Phone rings)

09:39.793 --> 09:41.371
Grissom.

09:42.546 --> 09:44.289
What?

09:44.423 --> 09:45.621
I'll be right there.

09:46.758 --> 09:49.214
No lunch.

09:49.344 --> 09:50.922
We got a time?

09:51.054 --> 09:55.681
All indications are he was braindead
from the time he collapsed at the hotel.

09:55.809 --> 09:57.636
- From?
- An artery outpouches

09:57.769 --> 09:59.892
Blood floods the subarachnoid space

10:00.022 --> 10:04.233
The heart still beats, but the brain's dead.
And it doesn't regenerate.

10:04.359 --> 10:06.316
Aneurysm from trauma?

10:06.445 --> 10:07.820
Infection?

10:07.946 --> 10:10.651
Genetic predisposition.
Both parents went that way.

10:10.782 --> 10:13.320
It increases
a person's chance of stroke tenfold.

10:13.452 --> 10:15.610
He looks like an athlete.

10:15.746 --> 10:19.162
Braindead at 38, otherwise healthy and strong.

10:19.291 --> 10:20.785
Is this a Frankenstein?

10:20.917 --> 10:22.875
I was wondering when you'd ask.

10:24.004 --> 10:26.080
Prime donor candidate. Next of kin signed off.

10:26.214 --> 10:28.622
How many organs did they take?

10:28.759 --> 10:32.377
- Eight in under two hours.
- Man, those harvest doctors move, don't they?

10:32.512 --> 10:34.386
Go, go, go!

10:34.514 --> 10:37.432
Here comes the liver. Ready with a basin.

10:37.559 --> 10:39.351
And here we go.

10:39.478 --> 10:41.517
New basin, please.

10:41.647 --> 10:44.316
Ready and... you got it. Here we go.

10:45.567 --> 10:47.856
I'll notify the PD about the organs.

10:52.824 --> 10:54.817
So, I was thinking...

10:56.244 --> 10:58.914
...maybe we could take our break
at the same time.

10:59.998 --> 11:02.205
Later this shift.

11:02.334 --> 11:04.125
Together.

11:04.252 --> 11:05.533
Sure.

11:05.671 --> 11:07.663
Really?

11:12.344 --> 11:14.135
Semen. No surprise there.

11:15.305 --> 11:20.216
Well, without the DNA sample
from the hotel guy, this test is pretty useless.

11:21.853 --> 11:25.057
I am more interested in who the woman is.

11:25.190 --> 11:30.066
Just like the bra, I'm gonna need
a reference of her DNA in order to do anything.

11:30.195 --> 11:31.226
What the heck...?

11:31.363 --> 11:33.320
What?

11:33.448 --> 11:35.192
Stripes.

11:37.577 --> 11:39.570
Stripes?

11:39.705 --> 11:43.868
Transverse white bands that appear
six weeks after the onset of symptoms of toxicity.

11:44.001 --> 11:45.993
- You got a closer view?
- Hm.

11:52.968 --> 11:55.091
They look like Mees lines to me

11:55.220 --> 11:56.798
Could be liver mortis.

11:56.930 --> 11:59.682
Or white striae,
indicative of heavy metal poisoning.

11:59.808 --> 12:03.675
You can't count on a photo to draw
that kind of conclusion. We need the body.

12:05.564 --> 12:07.556
Don't take this wrong, Dr Robbins,

12:07.691 --> 12:11.736
but how do you release a body that's
been re-dressed and dumped in an elevator?

12:11.862 --> 12:14.697
I deal with cause of death,
which was an aneurysm.

12:14.823 --> 12:16.816
And therefore natural.

12:16.950 --> 12:20.485
And, based on that,
his body is released to a mortuary.

12:20.621 --> 12:22.946
And the whole transplant thing didn't raise a flag.

12:23.081 --> 12:25.952
I thought I'd raised a flag with the good doctor

12:26.084 --> 12:28.955
when I told him
I was going to notify the Police Department.

12:29.087 --> 12:31.459
But evidently I miscommunicated again.

12:31.590 --> 12:33.132
Great.

12:37.220 --> 12:39.260
All may not be lost. Here.

12:39.389 --> 12:41.548
Body of Robert Fairmont

12:41.683 --> 12:43.925
released at 0400 hours

12:44.061 --> 12:45.804
to the Desert Haven Mortuary.

12:45.938 --> 12:47.136
I know that place.

12:47.272 --> 12:50.772
If they haven't embalmed him,
we could still test his blood for poisoning.

12:50.901 --> 12:52.893
Good. I'll drive.

12:55.614 --> 12:57.108
You're not coming?

12:58.283 --> 12:59.991
You found it, you run with it.

13:00.911 --> 13:02.987
You can do it. Take Nick.

13:03.121 --> 13:05.114
OK.

13:09.252 --> 13:11.660
How long's he been in here?

13:11.797 --> 13:15.746
92 minutes at 1,600 degrees.
What exactly was it you wanted to see?

13:15.884 --> 13:18.091
- His fingernails.
- I'm very sorry.

13:18.220 --> 13:20.129
Who approved this cremation?

13:22.182 --> 13:24.175
His wife, Julia Fairmont.

13:24.309 --> 13:27.346
The same person
who approved the organ transplants.

13:51.920 --> 13:54.589
- You told me your husband was in surgery.
- He was.

13:54.673 --> 13:58.042
Surgery to take his organs, not to save his life.

13:58.176 --> 14:00.169
He was technically...

14:00.304 --> 14:02.296
dead.

14:02.431 --> 14:05.800
He wanted to donate his organs.
I was following his wishes.

14:07.352 --> 14:09.345
Why are you being so hostile?

14:09.479 --> 14:11.686
Someone was poisoning your husband.

14:11.815 --> 14:13.190
What?

14:15.152 --> 14:17.607
We don't know the dose or the duration.

14:17.738 --> 14:19.730
But we do know the type of poison.

14:20.866 --> 14:23.404
We processed your husband's remains.

14:23.535 --> 14:26.370
Most poisons
would be completely burned off by cremation

14:26.496 --> 14:28.738
But heavy metals are very resistant to neat

14:31.168 --> 14:34.703
This heavy metal is called... selenium.

14:34.838 --> 14:38.421
Did you notice that your husband's breath
might have been garlicky?

14:38.550 --> 14:40.377
Garlicky?

14:40.510 --> 14:44.555
The body will excrete dimethyl selenite.
It smells just like garlic.

14:46.433 --> 14:48.426
No.

14:48.560 --> 14:51.229
Did you notice
the white stripes on his fingernails?

14:53.941 --> 14:55.933
We didn't see each other a lot.

14:56.068 --> 14:58.060
Bob was busy building his company.

14:58.195 --> 15:00.946
Did that bother you, him never being home?

15:05.118 --> 15:06.945
I think it would bother any woman.

15:08.121 --> 15:13.033
Did you know that the most common choice of
premeditated murder among women is poison?

15:13.168 --> 15:15.125
They cite its passivity.

15:18.590 --> 15:20.583
I did not poison my husband.

15:20.717 --> 15:22.626
You cremated his body.

15:22.761 --> 15:25.050
He wanted to be cremated. I cremated him.

15:25.180 --> 15:27.849
He wanted to donate his organs. I did that, too.

15:27.933 --> 15:32.891
Now, if there's nothing else, I will be at home
preparing for my husband's memorial service.

15:34.064 --> 15:36.057
Do you want us to notify you?

15:37.442 --> 15:39.435
Of what?

15:39.569 --> 15:43.104
When we find out the exact amount of selenium
given to your husband,

15:43.240 --> 15:45.232
and over what period of time.

15:45.367 --> 15:48.036
I thought you couldn't tell.

15:48.120 --> 15:50.824
Your husband's gone,
but his organs are still out there.

15:51.999 --> 15:53.991
Oh, good, yes.

15:54.126 --> 15:56.664
I would like to be notified.

16:03.051 --> 16:05.721
Straight up, am I going to die?

16:05.804 --> 16:10.016
You have only a small fraction
of the poison that was in your donor's body.

16:10.142 --> 16:12.134
One organ. With nothing new coming in,

16:12.269 --> 16:13.846
it should work its way out.

16:13.979 --> 16:16.980
I must have had a hundred tests.
How did you doctors miss this?

16:17.107 --> 16:21.187
A heavy metal like selenium is so rare
that it's not part of our screening protocol.

16:23.071 --> 16:25.064
You don't look like a doctor.

16:26.241 --> 16:28.234
No, sir. No, I'm not.

16:28.368 --> 16:31.203
I'm Nick Stokes.
I'm with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.

16:31.330 --> 16:33.821
- I'll be right outside.
- Thank you, Doctor.

16:36.543 --> 16:40.327
I was hoping I might be able to get
a sample of that new kidney of yours.

16:40.464 --> 16:42.207
A sample?

16:42.341 --> 16:43.539
Biopsy. A sliver.

16:43.675 --> 16:45.169
You mean open me up again?

16:46.345 --> 16:48.337
Maybe... an invasive scope.

16:48.472 --> 16:52.256
The only way I can get an accurate barometer
of the poison in Mr Fairmont's system

16:52.392 --> 16:54.219
is through one of his organs.

16:55.395 --> 16:57.388
I'm sorry, young man,

16:57.522 --> 16:59.480
but this is my kidney now.

16:59.608 --> 17:01.351
I waited four years

17:01.485 --> 17:03.561
I can't have anyone cut into me for it.

17:03.695 --> 17:05.355
I just can't.

17:05.489 --> 17:07.896
No, hey. Yeah, I understand.

17:09.367 --> 17:11.359
Thank you for your time.

17:13.538 --> 17:15.696
I like your watch, man. That's cool.

17:15.832 --> 17:17.659
It broke while I was down in surgery

17:17.792 --> 17:22.087
Stuck on 11 o'clock.
Think the Lord's trying to tell me something?

17:23.674 --> 17:26.080
Yeah. Get it to a watch repair shop.

17:30.055 --> 17:32.760
I hope you get to feeling better, Mr Mercer.

17:43.902 --> 17:47.271
Nick struck out on the kidney.
I got four no's over the phone

17:47.406 --> 17:50.525
and one yes from a recipient in Illinois. Heart.

17:50.659 --> 17:52.948
Useless. Heart has no memory for poison.

17:53.078 --> 17:57.028
Why can't we cut the middleman
and just check the wife's house for selenium?

17:58.166 --> 18:02.294
All right. I know something
about constitutional law. I get probable cause...

18:02.421 --> 18:03.796
Sara.

18:03.922 --> 18:06.793
I was just looking for you. Still up for a break?

18:06.925 --> 18:09.595
Sorry, Greg. A hot case.

18:09.720 --> 18:12.756
I'm going to look at Nick's champagne bottle.
How's our DNA?

18:12.889 --> 18:16.970
Uh, the inside-outside,
we're still looking for a reference for comparison.

18:17.102 --> 18:19.474
But the epidermals are looking promising.

18:19.605 --> 18:21.182
Nice.

18:21.315 --> 18:23.141
You wanna clue me in?

18:24.318 --> 18:26.394
Sara and I are just going out for dinner.

18:26.528 --> 18:28.604
On the case, Grego.

18:28.739 --> 18:30.945
Oh. Right.

18:36.246 --> 18:37.990
Excuse me,

18:38.123 --> 18:42.287
I'm Claudia Gideon, Bob Fairmont's secretary.
I came for his property.

18:42.419 --> 18:44.495
Sorry. Miss Willows already asked for it.

18:44.630 --> 18:48.841
His property is part of our investigation.
I'm afraid I have to take it.

18:48.967 --> 18:50.759
Fine. Just doing my job.

18:50.886 --> 18:56.011
Yeah, me too. Did you work for the Fairmonts
three years ago when Mr Fairmont was shot?

18:56.141 --> 18:58.347
I was out sick that day.

18:58.477 --> 18:59.805
Interesting.

19:02.522 --> 19:04.100
You have dandruff.

19:05.776 --> 19:07.768
Is that really proper etiquette?

19:09.404 --> 19:12.109
It is when I'm on a case.

19:12.240 --> 19:14.233
Do you mind?

19:15.619 --> 19:18.324
Where did you say you worked?

19:20.791 --> 19:22.997
I'm gonna ask you again.

19:23.126 --> 19:25.534
Were you in that hotel room with Bob Fairmont?

19:25.671 --> 19:27.046
I was not, no.

19:27.172 --> 19:30.671
But you did re-dress him
and place him in the elevator?

19:30.801 --> 19:35.344
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- That's dangerous to say to a scientist.

19:36.640 --> 19:38.633
(Clears throat) Dandruff

19:38.767 --> 19:41.056
is nothing more than sloughed-off skin.

19:41.186 --> 19:44.520
It has a nucleus,
just like a cell in your arm or your big toe.

19:45.649 --> 19:48.982
These 13 DNA markers

19:49.111 --> 19:51.068
from this dandruff cell

19:51.196 --> 19:54.530
are a match to the dandruff
that I recovered from your sweater.

19:54.658 --> 19:56.567
You were there...

19:56.702 --> 19:58.694
at the hotel

20:03.041 --> 20:05.367
OK.

20:05.502 --> 20:10.841
Mr Fairmont told me earlier that day to meet him
in his hotel room at nine to pick up some papers.

20:11.967 --> 20:14.505
When I got there, he was in bed, naked,

20:14.636 --> 20:16.428
unconscious

20:16.555 --> 20:19.758
He always told me
"Reputation before health No scandals"

20:21.560 --> 20:23.137
I dragged him to the elevator.

20:29.693 --> 20:31.686
Let me guess.

20:31.820 --> 20:33.943
You snuck out down the stairwell?

20:35.574 --> 20:38.694
- Who was Fairmont partying with in that room?
- I don't know.

20:38.827 --> 20:42.907
You won't mind if we compare your DNA
to the vaginal contribution

20:43.040 --> 20:46.290
of a condom
that we recovered from Mr Fairmont's room?

20:46.418 --> 20:48.458
Sure, go ahead.

20:48.587 --> 20:50.876
Good. We'd like to show you something else.

20:51.006 --> 20:55.004
About that accidental shooting
three years ago at your boss's house.

20:56.511 --> 21:01.138
In this re-enactment
Fairmont snot himself while cleaning his gun

21:02.893 --> 21:04.885
The story just doesn't add up.

21:05.020 --> 21:07.013
I think I fell for it because I was new

21:07.147 --> 21:11.892
and I wasn't too eager to talk to another guy
about him almost shooting off his manhood.

21:14.279 --> 21:16.272
This is the room as it was then.

21:16.406 --> 21:18.980
Based off of my crime scene photos.

21:19.117 --> 21:21.952
This is crime scene reconstruction new school

21:23.205 --> 21:25.197
Works backwards. Reverse time.

21:25.332 --> 21:27.289
The bullet hit here.

21:29.628 --> 21:33.957
The only logical place
for that bullet to have been shot from

21:34.091 --> 21:37.460
is four metres away one metre high

21:37.594 --> 21:40.963
He didn't accidentally snoot himself
Someone snot him

21:42.224 --> 21:44.466
We're thinking it was you.

21:45.644 --> 21:48.313
The admission form from the ER, 09/06/98.

21:48.438 --> 21:52.602
The person who brought Fairmont in
on the accidental shooting

21:52.734 --> 21:54.526
was you

21:55.654 --> 21:57.943
I didn't shoot him.

21:58.073 --> 22:01.276
You didn't poison him either.
All these bad things just happen.

22:02.452 --> 22:04.445
I'm on call 24 hours a day, OK.

22:04.579 --> 22:08.328
Mr Fairmont beeped me.
I drove out to the house and I took him in.

22:08.458 --> 22:09.869
Where was his wife?

22:13.505 --> 22:15.379
You'd have to ask her.

22:16.508 --> 22:19.462
Yes, I shot him.
He was supposed to go riding with me.

22:19.595 --> 22:23.129
He didn't show up until two in the morning.
No calls, nothing.

22:24.266 --> 22:25.974
I was...

22:26.101 --> 22:27.726
hurt.

22:27.853 --> 22:30.889
So, you just sat there in the dark

22:31.023 --> 22:33.015
and aimed south of his belt

22:33.150 --> 22:34.893
I just wanted to scare him.

22:35.027 --> 22:36.900
It was a business meeting.

22:37.029 --> 22:40.314
I swear. It wasn't like before.

22:40.449 --> 22:42.322
I was thinking about you the whole time.

22:43.493 --> 22:45.237
So, why didn't you tell the truth then?

22:45.370 --> 22:48.040
I wanted to, but Bob wouldn't let me.

22:48.165 --> 22:50.157
He said it would ruin his career.

22:50.292 --> 22:51.751
Fairmont Family Estates.

22:51.877 --> 22:55.921
Well, I'm presenting this case to the DA,
even if it is three years old.

22:56.048 --> 22:58.040
My husband's dead.

22:58.175 --> 23:01.758
We had our problems, but I loved him. I don't...

23:01.887 --> 23:04.378
I don't much care what you do now.

23:04.514 --> 23:07.848
There's two reasons a woman shoots a man.
She either loves him or hates him.

23:07.976 --> 23:09.518
Or both.

23:12.230 --> 23:15.184
That's the sample
Catherine pulled off the secretary's blouse

23:15.317 --> 23:18.234
and the hotel man's clothes. Same source.

23:18.362 --> 23:20.271
The secretary moved the body.

23:20.405 --> 23:22.896
We just interviewed her.
She copped to moving him.

23:23.033 --> 23:25.441
We're looking hard
at the wife and the poisoning.

23:25.577 --> 23:27.570
The secretary has dandruff.

23:27.704 --> 23:29.364
We know

23:29.498 --> 23:32.249
Dermatomycoses seborrhoea. We got it.

23:32.376 --> 23:35.958
Topical eczemas like that
require prescription medication.

23:36.088 --> 23:40.037
The primary ingredient of those medications,
selenium sulphide.

23:42.552 --> 23:44.344
I don't feel right about doing this.

23:44.471 --> 23:47.922
This is your residence.
Everything in Claudia's office is your property.

23:48.058 --> 23:50.051
She could be back from dinner at any moment

23:50.185 --> 23:52.178
This shouldn't take long.

24:29.099 --> 24:31.305
That's mine.

24:33.729 --> 24:35.935
Why do you keep your shampoo in your office?

24:36.064 --> 24:39.765
Shampoo full of the same poison
found in Bob Fairmont's remains.

24:39.901 --> 24:43.317
- I don't know.
- Ah, you have to do better than that.

24:43.447 --> 24:47.776
Maybe I picked it up at the pharmacy on lunch
and put it there. I don't know.

24:58.545 --> 25:00.538
Cream cheese.

25:02.841 --> 25:04.300
Garlic cream cheese.

25:04.426 --> 25:06.051
Hides the bitter aftertaste.

25:13.727 --> 25:16.977
It explains away his bad breath.

25:19.358 --> 25:22.062
I did not poison him.

25:22.194 --> 25:24.649
We'll see.

25:24.780 --> 25:26.737
Aren't you going to arrest her?

25:26.865 --> 25:29.237
I haven't done anything.

25:29.368 --> 25:31.028
Other than poison Bob.

25:31.161 --> 25:34.245
Poison? I'm the one who looked out for him.

25:34.373 --> 25:37.042
You? I ran his home. I entertained his clients.

25:37.167 --> 25:39.373
Who made all of his dental appointments?

25:39.503 --> 25:42.373
His haircuts? Who got his taxes in on time?

25:42.506 --> 25:44.748
Who covered for his mistresses?

25:44.883 --> 25:46.876
Why did he need mistresses?

25:47.010 --> 25:49.050
Ladies, don't go there.

25:51.932 --> 25:54.767
This is yours and these are yours.

25:54.893 --> 25:56.056
There's the door.

25:56.186 --> 25:59.104
We build a case before we make any arrests.

26:03.360 --> 26:05.353
Hey, Mr Mercer.

26:05.487 --> 26:07.895
I got your message. You wanted to talk to me?

26:08.031 --> 26:10.357
Did you find out who poisoned Mr Fairmont?

26:10.492 --> 26:11.690
No.

26:11.827 --> 26:14.318
No, sir. I have found selenium in his office,

26:14.454 --> 26:18.203
but without actually knowing
how much was in his system...

26:18.333 --> 26:21.038
What if I could tell you?

26:21.169 --> 26:23.162
My body's rejecting the organ.

26:23.297 --> 26:26.463
The doctor says it's nothing to do with poison.
It's antibodies.

26:28.302 --> 26:30.294
I'm sorry.

26:31.471 --> 26:34.591
I told you this watch stopped
while I was down in surgery.

26:34.725 --> 26:36.135
Funny

26:38.353 --> 26:41.390
It's like it knew all along
the kidney wasn't gonna take.

26:43.191 --> 26:45.729
Anyway if there's one last good thing I can do

26:45.861 --> 26:47.853
before I leave this earth...

26:47.988 --> 26:49.363
So...

26:49.489 --> 26:51.482
I will do this.

26:56.288 --> 27:00.617
Warrick won't even split a sandwich with me,
and this guy is willing to give us his kidney?

27:00.751 --> 27:02.328
You asked for it.

27:02.461 --> 27:04.453
Yeah, that's my point.

27:04.588 --> 27:09.214
Carl Mercer risks dying sooner to help
our investigation, but who protects his rights?

27:09.343 --> 27:10.801
He has free will.

27:11.929 --> 27:14.716
Well, so do I. I want to retract our request.

27:14.848 --> 27:19.142
I don't think any investigation for the dead
is worth hurting the living.

27:22.439 --> 27:23.637
What?

27:23.774 --> 27:25.149
Guys

27:25.275 --> 27:27.647
You're not gonna believe this.

27:27.778 --> 27:30.447
Often it is the simplest things
that seem so difficult.

27:30.572 --> 27:34.356
I was trying to match the partial from
the champagne bottle to these known prints.

27:34.493 --> 27:36.366
It was upside down.

27:44.002 --> 27:45.995
Must nave grabbed the bottle

27:46.129 --> 27:48.537
upside down to pour

28:00.018 --> 28:01.845
So?

28:01.979 --> 28:03.141
Who was he with?

28:03.272 --> 28:05.229
Mrs Fairmont.

28:05.357 --> 28:08.393
What? Player was in the hotel
cheating with his own wife?

28:09.695 --> 28:11.319
I was trying to...

28:11.446 --> 28:13.071
rekindle our marriage.

28:13.198 --> 28:14.989
I got the room,

28:15.117 --> 28:16.741
brought the champagne.

28:16.868 --> 28:18.446
Oh, yes.

28:18.578 --> 28:20.121
Yes.

28:20.247 --> 28:23.367
He squeezed me in
between business meetings at the hotel.

28:23.500 --> 28:26.169
You didn't think to tell me that
when we first talked?

28:27.254 --> 28:31.417
No, because you asked me
about him being re-dressed in an elevator.

28:31.550 --> 28:33.341
And, besides, when I left him,

28:33.468 --> 28:35.212
he was... alive,

28:35.345 --> 28:37.089
watching the news.

28:43.729 --> 28:46.516
Oh, so he had a stroke alone after you left?

28:47.899 --> 28:49.773
Argh!

28:51.445 --> 28:53.852
I'm not a doctor. I don't know when he had it.

28:53.989 --> 28:57.358
CSI is testing
that champagne bottle for selenium

28:57.492 --> 29:00.280
I didn't think poison caused strokes.

29:00.412 --> 29:04.279
You seem to know a lot about poison
for not being a doctor.

29:06.126 --> 29:08.451
I know a lot of things about a lot of things.

29:08.587 --> 29:11.256
But that doesn't mean that I killed my husband.

29:13.508 --> 29:15.501
Yeah.

29:15.636 --> 29:17.628
But what never lies?

29:20.432 --> 29:22.425
Fairmont had three gold crowns.

29:22.559 --> 29:24.884
They should have survived the cremation.

29:25.020 --> 29:27.855
At least partially. Heavy metal, after all.

29:30.484 --> 29:32.061
His wife

29:32.194 --> 29:33.985
had them removed at the mortuary.

29:34.112 --> 29:36.603
That's a new meaning
to the phrase "gold-digger".

29:36.740 --> 29:39.278
Actually, that's how the phrase got started.

29:39.409 --> 29:42.079
People used to dig up the bodies
to extract the gold.

29:42.204 --> 29:44.196
Now they just marry them.

29:44.331 --> 29:47.664
In some countries this would be enough
to have her arrested for murder.

29:47.793 --> 29:51.660
What's the most important component
in a poisoning?

29:52.839 --> 29:54.417
Poison.

29:54.549 --> 29:56.293
Patience.

29:58.595 --> 30:00.588
(Groans)

30:04.643 --> 30:06.636
Mrs Fairmont?

30:06.770 --> 30:08.763
Mrs Fairmont, are you feeling OK?

30:08.897 --> 30:10.689
Yeah, I'm fine. Argh!

30:10.816 --> 30:12.607
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

30:12.734 --> 30:14.810
Maybe I just need to sit down for a minute.

30:14.945 --> 30:16.937
Sit down here in the car for a sec.

30:19.241 --> 30:21.233
Hey, girl, relax, relax, relax.

30:25.163 --> 30:28.200
Yeah, I need an ambulance.
Vegas PD west parking lot.

30:54.192 --> 30:57.229
What's going on? I called the hospital.
She's been released.

30:57.362 --> 31:01.656
ER doc gave her a shot of hydropazeen.
Sent her on her way.

31:01.783 --> 31:03.326
Hydropazeen?

31:03.452 --> 31:05.361
That's an anti-emetic.

31:05.495 --> 31:07.821
Used to counteract heavy metal poisoning.

31:07.956 --> 31:10.993
Which means
somebody's been poisoning our suspect.

31:13.712 --> 31:17.045
I don't know how it happened.
Maybe she poisoned herself.

31:17.174 --> 31:19.001
Why would she do that?

31:19.134 --> 31:22.088
Why would she hide my shampoo in my office?

31:22.220 --> 31:26.004
- Do you know she did that?
- It wasn't her husband. He was already dead.

31:26.141 --> 31:28.383
She's trying to frame me for killing him.

31:28.518 --> 31:31.009
Do you have any evidence that she did kill him?

31:31.146 --> 31:33.139
She had his gold fillings removed.

31:33.273 --> 31:35.681
Doesn't that tell you something about her?

31:38.278 --> 31:40.354
I had his watch and ring removed, too.

31:40.489 --> 31:43.276
Do you want to see them?
They're in a box at home.

31:43.408 --> 31:45.365
You realise that doesn't look good?

31:45.494 --> 31:48.578
It can look however it wants.
I have nothing to hide.

31:48.705 --> 31:51.077
You mean
since you yourself have been poisoned?

31:51.208 --> 31:54.743
Why don't you ask Claudia Richards about that?
First my husband, then me.

31:54.878 --> 31:57.084
Why would she want to kill either one of you?

31:57.214 --> 31:59.206
I don't know.

32:01.551 --> 32:05.300
Maybe because he refused to leave me for her.

32:08.308 --> 32:10.978
I had to wash his grungy coffee mug every night.

32:11.061 --> 32:13.552
I had to clean his toenail clippings
off of his desk.

32:13.689 --> 32:16.476
Why would I ever ask Bob Fairmont
to leave anyone for me?

32:16.608 --> 32:18.648
So you think it was all in Mrs Fairmont's head?

32:19.820 --> 32:22.062
He always said she was crazy.

32:22.197 --> 32:26.942
OK, that's it. Look, we're not leaving here
till we get to the bottom of this.

32:28.829 --> 32:30.821
Then I hope she talks soon.

32:40.132 --> 32:42.124
Greg?

32:42.259 --> 32:43.753
Hey.

32:43.885 --> 32:46.092
I was just printing something out for you.

32:46.221 --> 32:48.214
On your hot case.

32:50.017 --> 32:51.808
From the internet?

32:51.935 --> 32:54.343
Yeah, I was on break, had some time.

32:55.522 --> 32:57.266
Hey.

32:58.400 --> 33:00.606
Sorry I drew a blank on the wife.

33:02.112 --> 33:05.315
I could really... really just kiss you right now.

33:14.875 --> 33:16.867
So, this is Claudia.

33:17.002 --> 33:19.919
Ten years ago her husband John Gideon

33:27.387 --> 33:30.507
Claudia's rich husband also died young. 35.

33:30.641 --> 33:33.511
She donated his organs and cremated his body.

33:33.644 --> 33:35.517
We don't have to chase down these organs.

33:35.646 --> 33:39.643
Ralph Parks rejected the organ
that he got from Claudia's husband.

33:39.775 --> 33:41.399
An organ with a memory, maybe?

33:41.526 --> 33:43.484
The most. Liver.

33:43.612 --> 33:47.479
He died two months after receiving it
Back in '93

33:47.616 --> 33:49.608
Lived one state over, in Arizona.

33:49.743 --> 33:52.199
I have the cemetery address.

33:52.329 --> 33:55.449
- Hey, Sara, I got the warrant.
- Awesome.

33:55.582 --> 33:57.374
We'll keep you posted.

34:19.273 --> 34:22.641
Embalming certainly retards
the decomposition process.

34:22.775 --> 34:24.899
Well, it doesn't stop the smell.

34:25.027 --> 34:27.484
The liver's degraded,

34:27.614 --> 34:29.406
but any metals should still be there

34:31.326 --> 34:33.319
We'll find out.

35:17.039 --> 35:19.031
Nick, did you get anything?

35:19.166 --> 35:21.158
Hey, Sara. Yeah. Sodium selenite.

35:21.293 --> 35:23.285
Selenium.

35:23.420 --> 35:24.998
280mg.

35:25.130 --> 35:26.708
For a 180Ib man.

35:26.840 --> 35:28.548
That's murder.

35:28.675 --> 35:30.917
It would have been murder for a 300Ib man.

35:31.053 --> 35:33.378
This is different than the shampoo compound.

35:33.513 --> 35:36.514
Yeah, it contains polysorbate 80 and vitamin E.

35:36.642 --> 35:40.224
That combination is found
in selenium supplements injected in animals.

35:40.354 --> 35:43.271
Animals? Like cats, dogs?

35:43.398 --> 35:45.640
Mostly livestock. Grazers.

35:45.776 --> 35:49.275
To make up for
the lack of selenium nutrient in the soil.

35:49.404 --> 35:52.074
How did Claudia get access to this stuff?

35:52.157 --> 35:54.150
A dairy farm.

35:54.284 --> 35:56.443
Gideon Dairy & Cheese.

35:58.580 --> 36:01.036
Largest supplier of milk in Connecticut, in fact.

36:02.876 --> 36:07.088
Brass talked to a local chamber-of-commerce
type about Claudia's husband.

36:07.214 --> 36:10.168
You want to know who his secretary was?

36:10.300 --> 36:11.711
Yeah.

36:11.843 --> 36:13.254
Yeah.

36:13.387 --> 36:16.056
Our Julia Fairmont

36:22.312 --> 36:24.104
Ten years ago,

36:24.231 --> 36:26.022
you played secretary

36:26.149 --> 36:27.941
and you played wife.

36:28.068 --> 36:29.646
To John Gideon.

36:29.778 --> 36:32.150
We never said
we didn't know each other previously.

36:34.616 --> 36:37.190
And I wasn't playing
I was a nard-working secretary

36:40.289 --> 36:43.325
And you loved your husband
right up to the day he died?

36:43.458 --> 36:46.246
Of 240mg of selenium.

36:46.378 --> 36:49.295
Animal selenium. The kind used for cattle.

36:49.423 --> 36:52.839
Well, we did live in grazing country.
Although I have to say,

36:52.968 --> 36:56.419
Julia knew more about livestock than I did.
She rode horses.

36:56.555 --> 37:01.016
I took the job because Mr G
let me board my horse at the family stables.

37:01.143 --> 37:03.431
I hated the stables.

37:03.562 --> 37:05.519
The smell. Never stepped foot in them.

37:05.647 --> 37:08.518
Implicating you. The secretary.

37:10.235 --> 37:12.027
I don't believe this.

37:12.154 --> 37:14.230
Bravo, ladies.

37:14.364 --> 37:16.772
You have got this down to a science.

37:18.452 --> 37:21.488
Why did it happen the first time?

37:21.622 --> 37:24.658
Hubby ignored you or abused you,

37:24.791 --> 37:26.701
or you got sick of him fooling around?

37:26.835 --> 37:30.418
So you started slipping the cow stuff
into his chocolate milk?

37:38.180 --> 37:40.885
So, the two of you struck a deal.

37:41.016 --> 37:43.305
I'm coming into a lot of money.

37:52.611 --> 37:55.018
No. We are.

37:57.950 --> 37:59.823
And then what?

37:59.952 --> 38:03.285
You two realised how quickly
you could run through a couple of million?

38:03.413 --> 38:06.367
So you went looking for another mark
here in Nevada?

38:07.501 --> 38:11.451
But the difference is
that you actually loved Bob Fairmont.

38:14.508 --> 38:16.631
You shot him because he was cheating.

38:16.760 --> 38:20.805
But that didn't get in the way
of your...long-term goals,

38:22.224 --> 38:23.635
did it?

38:23.767 --> 38:25.345
(Tap on window)

38:35.570 --> 38:37.563
I just came from the DA.

38:38.699 --> 38:40.691
Their attorneys were there as well.

38:40.826 --> 38:45.322
Based on everything we have, the DA is not
gonna move forward. He says it's a reject.

38:45.455 --> 38:48.824
- Brass doesn't have anything?
- Brass is still in the field.

38:50.002 --> 38:51.994
You're free to go.

38:59.136 --> 39:01.175
Where's the ladies' room?

39:02.347 --> 39:04.221
It's down the hall to your right.

39:04.349 --> 39:06.342
Thanks.

39:07.477 --> 39:09.102
Pardon me.

39:12.107 --> 39:17.184
Well, no big surprise. We have proof of poison,
but no way to prove which one of them did it.

39:17.321 --> 39:19.194
I like either one of them for the murder.

39:19.323 --> 39:22.027
"She said, she said" defence is never gonna fly.

39:22.159 --> 39:24.484
They'll raise each other as a viable suspect

39:24.620 --> 39:27.786
- just like they did with us
- That's what the DA said, verbatim.

39:27.914 --> 39:29.954
See you back at CSI.

39:30.083 --> 39:31.875
Wait. What...?

39:32.002 --> 39:35.086
So, what, just let them move on to another state,
another husband?

39:35.213 --> 39:36.873
It's not always up to us.

39:50.228 --> 39:52.221
Sara!

39:53.357 --> 39:55.148
Look.

39:56.318 --> 39:58.394
I know this isn't news to you,

39:58.528 --> 40:00.817
but sometimes science isn't enough.

40:00.948 --> 40:03.617
What are we doing?

40:03.700 --> 40:05.693
Digging up graves,

40:05.827 --> 40:07.820
chasing prints...

40:07.955 --> 40:09.947
if it's no good in court?

40:10.082 --> 40:12.655
If the killers win?

40:12.793 --> 40:15.628
It isn't a competition. We don't win.

40:16.797 --> 40:18.670
The courts are like dice

40:18.799 --> 40:22.879
They have no memory.
What works one week doesn't work the next.

40:23.011 --> 40:25.004
I know that. I do.

40:25.138 --> 40:26.930
I know that.

40:27.057 --> 40:28.931
That's why I'm mad.

40:29.059 --> 40:32.226
But see, if you get mad, then they do win.

40:32.354 --> 40:33.765
You just said...

40:38.568 --> 40:40.645
This is one of your riddles, isn't it?

40:41.822 --> 40:43.613
One of life's riddles.

40:44.783 --> 40:46.740
But hey!

40:46.868 --> 40:48.861
The good news,

40:48.996 --> 40:51.534
there's no statute of limitation on murder.
