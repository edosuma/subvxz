00:02.670 --> 00:03.804
Hey.

00:03.837 --> 00:05.573
Hello.

00:05.606 --> 00:07.041
Jim!

00:07.075 --> 00:08.409
What's up, buddy?
This is not funny.

00:08.442 --> 00:09.577
Why is my stuff in here?

00:09.610 --> 00:11.145
Wow, that's weird.

00:11.179 --> 00:12.780
Ooh, dollar for a stapler,
that's pretty good.

00:12.813 --> 00:15.049
Yeah, well I'm not paying
for my own stuff, okay?

00:15.083 --> 00:16.317
I know you did this
'cause you're friends

00:16.350 --> 00:17.618
with the, uh,
vending machine guy.

00:17.651 --> 00:18.619
Who Steve?

00:18.652 --> 00:19.820
Yeah, Steve.
Oh, sorry.

00:19.853 --> 00:22.756
Or whatever
his name is.
What do I want?

00:22.790 --> 00:25.126
Ooh, it's a pencil cup.

00:25.159 --> 00:27.161
Oh, no, no, no, no.

00:27.195 --> 00:28.362
That's my pencil cup.

00:28.396 --> 00:30.498
Um, I don't think so,
I just bought it.

00:30.531 --> 00:33.734
Uh, I think so, and you're
going to hand it over to me.

00:33.767 --> 00:35.669
I love these.

00:35.703 --> 00:38.472
Okay, fine.

00:38.506 --> 00:40.374
My wallet?

00:40.408 --> 00:41.375
Um.

00:41.409 --> 00:45.113
Oh, there it is. J1.

00:45.146 --> 00:46.414
Here, you know what?
I don't have any--

00:46.447 --> 00:48.116
You can have
some nickels.

00:52.220 --> 00:55.256
5, 10.

00:55.289 --> 00:58.759
15, 20, 25...

01:01.495 --> 01:08.669
*

01:31.259 --> 01:33.461
Hello, everyone.

01:33.494 --> 01:34.495
Morning, Michael.

01:34.528 --> 01:36.130
Where are we going
this afternoon?

01:36.164 --> 01:37.231
Nah, ha, ha.

01:37.265 --> 01:40.468
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

01:40.501 --> 01:42.736
Last week, Michael sent out
this mysterious memo.

01:42.770 --> 01:45.139
"It's time for our first
quarter camaraderie event.

01:45.173 --> 01:47.441
"So pack a swimsuit,
a toothbrush,

01:47.475 --> 01:49.310
"rubber-soled shoes,

01:49.343 --> 01:50.444
and a ski mask."

01:50.478 --> 01:52.613
A ski mask
and a swimsuit?

01:52.646 --> 01:55.749
So that he can
have us rob a bank

01:55.783 --> 01:57.851
and then escape
through the sewers.

01:57.885 --> 02:01.522
And brush our teeth.

02:01.555 --> 02:02.656
Yeah?

02:02.690 --> 02:03.924
Michael.

02:03.957 --> 02:06.227
Stanley...bo banley.

02:06.260 --> 02:07.228
I need to know--

02:07.261 --> 02:08.396
Banana fanna fo fanley.

02:08.429 --> 02:09.397
What we're doing.
Me mi mo manley.

02:09.430 --> 02:10.398
You said bring
a toothbrush.

02:10.431 --> 02:12.233
Stanley.

02:12.266 --> 02:13.267
Is this an overnight?

02:13.301 --> 02:18.406
Maybe. The suspense is just
so exciting, isn't it?

02:18.439 --> 02:20.474
Should my wife tell her boss
she's not coming in tomorrow?

02:20.508 --> 02:22.210
Maybe, I don't know.

02:22.243 --> 02:23.544
Not maybe, yes or no.

02:23.577 --> 02:26.647
Well, no, but...okay,
don't spoil it for everybody.

02:26.680 --> 02:28.482
All right?

02:28.516 --> 02:32.186
But, we are going
on a booze cruise

02:32.220 --> 02:35.189
on Lake Wallempaupack.

02:35.223 --> 02:37.725
In January.

02:37.758 --> 02:39.960
It's cheaper.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.395
This is not just
another party.

02:41.429 --> 02:44.332
This is a leadership
training exercise.

02:44.365 --> 02:45.733
Right?

02:45.766 --> 02:49.237
I'm going to combine elements
of fun and motivation

02:49.270 --> 02:53.641
and education into a single,
mind-blowing experience.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.943
It is now time to unveil

02:55.976 --> 02:58.612
the destination of
this year's retreat.

02:58.646 --> 03:02.950
We are going
on a harbor cruise

03:02.983 --> 03:04.452
of Lake Wallempaupack.

03:09.357 --> 03:11.225
It's a booze cruise.

03:11.259 --> 03:13.994
All right.

03:14.027 --> 03:16.630
I have a test for business
school tomorrow night.

03:16.664 --> 03:19.333
Is it okay if skip the cruise
and study for that?

03:19.367 --> 03:21.001
No, this is mandatory.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.336
But don't worry,
you know what?

03:22.370 --> 03:23.371
You're going
to learn plenty.

03:23.404 --> 03:27.308
This is going to turn
your life around, Ryan.

03:27.341 --> 03:28.642
I'm already in business school.

03:28.676 --> 03:29.943
Wait, Michael?

03:29.977 --> 03:30.978
Yeah?

03:31.011 --> 03:33.447
Um, why did you tell us
to bring a bathing suit?

03:33.481 --> 03:34.915
To throw you off the scent.

03:34.948 --> 03:36.550
Yeah, but I bought
a bathing suit.

03:36.584 --> 03:38.852
Well, just keep the tags on
and you can return it.

03:38.886 --> 03:40.821
I took the tags off already.

03:40.854 --> 03:41.889
Well, that's not
my fault, okay?

03:41.922 --> 03:43.891
Just--we're not going
to pay for a bathing suit.

03:43.924 --> 03:44.992
Okay.

03:45.025 --> 03:45.993
I know what you're
all thinking.

03:46.026 --> 03:47.961
Who is this
smart little cookie?

03:47.995 --> 03:49.963
Her name is Brenda...

03:49.997 --> 03:52.032
something, and she
is from corporate.

03:52.065 --> 03:55.336
And she is here, like you, to
learn from what I have to say.

03:55.369 --> 03:56.937
I am a great
motivational speaker.

03:56.970 --> 04:01.609
I attended a Tony Robbins event
by the airport last year, and--

04:01.642 --> 04:03.944
It wasn't the actual course.

04:03.977 --> 04:05.646
You have to pay
for the actual course.

04:05.679 --> 04:10.050
But, it talked about
the actual course.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.786
And I've incorporated

04:12.820 --> 04:16.590
a lot of his ideas
into my own course.

04:16.624 --> 04:19.427
Leader...ship.

04:19.460 --> 04:24.432
The word ship is hidden inside
the word leadership,

04:24.465 --> 04:27.000
as its derivation.

04:27.034 --> 04:32.005
So, if this office
is in fact a ship,

04:32.039 --> 04:33.774
as its leader...

04:33.807 --> 04:35.743
I am the captain.

04:35.776 --> 04:36.910
But...

04:36.944 --> 04:38.912
We're all in the same boat.

04:38.946 --> 04:40.914
Teamwork.

04:40.948 --> 04:44.752
Last year, Michael's theme was
"bowl over the competition."

04:44.785 --> 04:48.088
So, guess where we went?

04:48.121 --> 04:51.959
Now, on this ship
that is the office,

04:51.992 --> 04:54.662
what is the sales department?

04:54.695 --> 04:57.331
Anyone?

04:57.365 --> 04:59.900
How about the sales department
is the sails?

04:59.933 --> 05:01.068
Yes, Daryl.

05:01.101 --> 05:02.936
The sales department
makes sales.

05:02.970 --> 05:03.937
Good.

05:03.971 --> 05:04.938
Let me just explain.

05:04.972 --> 05:06.907
I see the sales department

05:06.940 --> 05:08.742
as the furnace.

05:08.776 --> 05:10.878
A furnace?
Yeah.

05:10.911 --> 05:11.912
Yeesh, how old
is this ship?

05:11.945 --> 05:13.647
How about the anchor?

05:13.681 --> 05:15.015
What does the furnace do?

05:15.048 --> 05:16.950
All right, let's not get
hung up on the furnace.

05:16.984 --> 05:18.051
This just--

05:18.085 --> 05:19.019
It's the sales--

05:19.052 --> 05:20.521
I see the sales department
are down there.

05:20.554 --> 05:21.655
They're in the engine room

05:21.689 --> 05:24.792
and they are shoveling
coal into the furnace, right?

05:24.825 --> 05:25.859
I mean who saw
the movie Titanic?

05:25.893 --> 05:27.895
They were very important
in the movie Titanic.

05:27.928 --> 05:29.730
Who saw it?
Show of hands.

05:29.763 --> 05:31.832
Not really sure what movie
you're talking about.

05:31.865 --> 05:32.866
You sure you got
the title right?

05:32.900 --> 05:33.934
Titanic.

05:33.967 --> 05:36.103
I think you're thinking of
The Hunt for Red October.

05:36.136 --> 05:37.104
No, I'm--

05:37.137 --> 05:39.072
Leo DiCaprio, come on!

05:39.106 --> 05:40.273
Michael stands in
the front of the boat

05:40.307 --> 05:43.143
and says that he's king of
the world within the first hour,

05:43.176 --> 05:46.680
or I give you
my next paycheck.

05:46.714 --> 05:48.549
Michael, everyone in
the engine room drowned.

05:48.582 --> 05:51.485
No--thank you,
spoiler alert.

05:51.519 --> 05:53.454
You saw the movie,
those of you who did.

05:55.022 --> 05:56.957
They're happy down there
in the furnace room.

05:56.990 --> 05:58.692
And they're dirty and grimy

05:58.726 --> 05:59.893
and sweaty.

05:59.927 --> 06:02.830
And they're singing
their ethnic songs.

06:02.863 --> 06:06.166
And--actually,
that might be Warehouse.

06:06.199 --> 06:08.001
What?

06:08.035 --> 06:09.470
The--no--

06:09.503 --> 06:11.004
No, I didn't--

06:11.038 --> 06:12.573
Okay, well, the--

06:12.606 --> 06:15.943
Okay, in a nutshell what I'm
saying is leadership.

06:15.976 --> 06:17.945
We'll get--we'll talk more
about that on the boat.

06:17.978 --> 06:21.449
Aye, aye, Captain.

06:21.482 --> 06:25.819
* A three-hour tour

06:25.853 --> 06:27.020
Pam, you are Mary Ann.

06:27.054 --> 06:28.155
We have...

06:28.188 --> 06:29.790
The Professor and Ginger.

06:29.823 --> 06:31.024
Welcome aboard.

06:31.058 --> 06:33.193
Angela, you are Mrs. Howell.

06:33.226 --> 06:34.194
Lovey.

06:34.227 --> 06:35.596
Uh, the native.

06:35.629 --> 06:36.664
Sometimes they come
from neighboring--

06:36.697 --> 06:38.666
Oh, uh, we have, uh...

06:38.699 --> 06:40.668
one of the Globetrotters.

06:40.701 --> 06:41.669
I am the Skipper.

06:41.702 --> 06:43.904
And Dwight,
you will be Gilligan.

06:43.937 --> 06:45.072
Cool.

06:45.105 --> 06:45.873
Actually, I'm the Skipper.

06:45.906 --> 06:48.008
Okay.
But you could
be Gilligan.

06:48.041 --> 06:49.009
Oh, I'd rather die.

06:49.042 --> 06:50.043
Hi.
I am Michael Scott.

06:50.077 --> 06:51.712
I am the Captain
of this party.

06:51.745 --> 06:52.980
I'm Captain Jack.

06:53.013 --> 06:54.582
I'm captain of the ship.
Ahh!

06:54.615 --> 06:56.116
I'm also captain of anyone
who sets foot on the ship.

06:56.149 --> 06:57.117
Hi, welcome aboard.

06:57.150 --> 07:00.053
Okay.

07:00.087 --> 07:01.589
In an office,
when you are ranking people,

07:01.622 --> 07:04.692
manager is higher than captain.

07:04.725 --> 07:06.594
On a boat, who knows?

07:06.627 --> 07:09.497
It's nebul-ose.

07:09.530 --> 07:10.931
Hey, look.

07:10.964 --> 07:13.567
I'm king of the world!

07:13.601 --> 07:17.204
Woo!

07:17.237 --> 07:20.508
Woo!

07:21.274 --> 07:22.810
Okay, all right.

07:22.843 --> 07:24.111
Welcome aboard.

07:24.144 --> 07:26.580
I am your captain,
Captain Jack.

07:26.614 --> 07:29.249
And I am the Regional Manager
of Dunder Mifflin,

07:29.282 --> 07:30.884
Michael Scott.

07:30.918 --> 07:32.920
Welcome, welcome.

07:32.953 --> 07:33.921
Okay, so, um--
Okay, so.

07:33.954 --> 07:35.989
Please--the, uh,
life preservers.

07:36.023 --> 07:37.725
They are located

07:37.758 --> 07:39.126
underneath the seats
all along the perimeter

07:39.159 --> 07:40.293
But don't worry.
of the boat.

07:40.327 --> 07:41.328
You are not going to be needing
life preservers tonight.

07:41.361 --> 07:42.129
Well, we might be, okay?
This is just gonna be--

07:42.162 --> 07:44.732
Please let me finish, okay?
Well--

07:44.765 --> 07:45.966
Thank you.

07:45.999 --> 07:47.134
So the Coast Guard requires

07:47.167 --> 07:49.637
that I tell you where
the safety exits are.

07:49.670 --> 07:50.838
Now, on this ship,
it's very easy.

07:50.871 --> 07:54.642
Anywhere over the side.

07:54.675 --> 07:55.676
Not only am I
your ship's captain,

07:55.709 --> 07:57.110
I am also
your party captain!

07:57.144 --> 07:59.079
Woo, we're going to get it going
here in just a few minutes--

07:59.112 --> 08:01.114
And I am your
party captain too!

08:01.148 --> 08:03.183
And you are going to put
on your dancing shoes

08:03.216 --> 08:04.518
later on.
Hey, Mike, Mike.

08:04.552 --> 08:05.919
So, we are gonna--

08:05.953 --> 08:08.121
Uh, if you don't mind.
Rock it...what?

08:08.155 --> 08:10.223
Please, okay?

08:10.257 --> 08:13.060
If the boat's a-rocking,
don't come knocking.

08:13.093 --> 08:14.061
Michael!
Yup.

08:14.094 --> 08:15.629
Uh, your company employees

08:15.663 --> 08:17.164
are not the only people
on the boat tonight, okay?

08:17.197 --> 08:18.231
We're all gonna have
a good time tonight.

08:18.265 --> 08:20.568
Hey, hey,
listen, Mike.

08:20.601 --> 08:22.169
Why don't you let me
and my crew do our job?

08:22.202 --> 08:23.303
You just sit back--
Mm-hmm.

08:23.336 --> 08:25.238
And have
a good time, okay?
Okay, yup.

08:25.272 --> 08:26.874
All right?

08:26.907 --> 08:27.975
You guys,

08:28.008 --> 08:29.142
it's like we're
in high school

08:29.176 --> 08:30.277
and we're at
the cool table.

08:30.310 --> 08:32.012
Right?

08:32.045 --> 08:33.246
Yeah.

08:33.280 --> 08:34.447
Kim, were you a cheerleader?

08:34.481 --> 08:38.151
No, she was total little Miss
Artsy Fartsy in high school.

08:38.185 --> 08:40.187
She wore the turtleneck
and everything.

08:40.220 --> 08:42.122
That's hilarious.

08:42.155 --> 08:43.657
It's not
hilarious, but--

08:43.691 --> 08:44.825
Where'd you
go to school?

08:44.858 --> 08:46.159
Fisher Bohara.

08:46.193 --> 08:47.895
"Piss la poo
cares"

08:47.928 --> 08:49.797
We played you.

08:49.830 --> 08:52.199
You--you really
look familiar.

08:52.232 --> 08:54.101
Did you, uh--You cheered
for them, didn't you?

08:54.134 --> 08:56.203
Mm, no.

08:56.236 --> 08:58.138
Yes, I did.

08:58.171 --> 08:59.940
* A-W-E

08:59.973 --> 09:01.942
* S-O-M-E

09:01.975 --> 09:03.176
* Awesome, awesome
is what we are *

09:03.210 --> 09:05.278
* we're the football
superstars *

09:05.312 --> 09:07.214
* A-W-E
I remember that!

09:07.247 --> 09:09.917
* S-O-M-E
We crushed you, like, 42-10.

09:09.950 --> 09:11.218
Having fun?
Yeah.

09:11.251 --> 09:13.821
Everybody's really nice.

09:13.854 --> 09:16.223
Good, well, that is what
Scranton is all about.

09:16.256 --> 09:19.593
Not like you "New Yawkers."

09:19.627 --> 09:20.728
When are you going
to start the, uh--

09:20.761 --> 09:21.895
What?
The, uh, presentation?

09:21.929 --> 09:24.131
Well, I already sort of
started it back at the office

09:24.164 --> 09:26.133
and on the dock with
the Gilligan thing.

09:26.166 --> 09:28.602
So, right now,
I was thinking.

09:28.636 --> 09:29.603
Yes.

09:29.637 --> 09:30.671
Okay!

09:30.704 --> 09:32.005
Listen up,

09:32.039 --> 09:33.674
all you, Dunder Mifflinites!

09:33.707 --> 09:35.008
I would like to talk

09:35.042 --> 09:36.877
to you all about

09:36.910 --> 09:38.378
life preservers.

09:38.411 --> 09:41.181
Now, one important
life preserver

09:41.214 --> 09:43.350
in business is IT Support.

09:43.383 --> 09:46.186
Not now Mike,
we're doing the limbo!

09:46.219 --> 09:48.155
That's right, partiers.

09:48.188 --> 09:50.023
It's time to limbo,
limbo, limbo.

09:50.057 --> 09:52.125
So, okay.
All right!

09:52.159 --> 09:53.193
I need a volunteer

09:53.226 --> 09:54.862
to come up here
and hold my stick.

09:54.895 --> 09:56.096
Huh, who's it gonna be?

09:56.129 --> 09:57.397
Me.
Me, me, me.

09:57.430 --> 09:58.398
Me, me, me.

09:58.431 --> 10:00.033
Uh.

10:00.067 --> 10:01.935
Usually, it's a woman.

10:01.969 --> 10:03.370
I'm stronger.

10:03.403 --> 10:04.304
Hey, I got an idea.

10:04.337 --> 10:07.374
How would you like
to steer the ship, Dwight?

10:07.407 --> 10:08.776
Keep us on a steady course.

10:08.809 --> 10:11.278
Keep a sharp eye out,
I'm counting on you.

10:11.311 --> 10:13.714
I was the youngest pilot
in Pan Am history.

10:13.747 --> 10:17.084
When I was four, the pilot
let me ride in the cockpit

10:17.117 --> 10:19.987
and fly the plane with him.

10:20.020 --> 10:22.289
And I was four
and I was great!

10:22.322 --> 10:23.256
And I would have landed it,

10:23.290 --> 10:26.059
but my dad wanted us
to go back to our seats.

10:29.396 --> 10:31.064
All right, all right.

10:31.098 --> 10:34.301
That was great, now it's time
for the dance contest!

10:34.334 --> 10:36.870
Why don't we do that after
I do my presentation and--

10:36.904 --> 10:37.905
Nope.

10:37.938 --> 10:39.106
Dance contest!

10:39.139 --> 10:42.075
All right, we'll have a
motivational dance contest.

10:42.109 --> 10:43.744
Hit it!

10:43.777 --> 10:46.113
Yeah, okay.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.114
Dancing.

10:47.147 --> 10:52.119
It is a primal art form
used in ancient times

10:52.152 --> 10:57.024
to express yourself
with the body.

10:57.057 --> 11:00.160
And communicate.

11:09.502 --> 11:12.405
Sometimes you have
to take a break

11:12.439 --> 11:13.874
from being the kind of boss

11:13.907 --> 11:15.743
that's always trying
to teach people things.

11:15.776 --> 11:18.846
Sometimes you have to just
to be the boss of dancing.

11:29.322 --> 11:32.793
* What do you do with
a drunken sailor *

11:32.826 --> 11:36.864
a drunken sailor *
* What do you do with

11:36.897 --> 11:40.067
* What do you do with
a drunken sailor *

11:40.100 --> 11:43.036
* Early in the morning

11:45.272 --> 11:46.874
Hey, come inside
and talk to me.

11:46.907 --> 11:48.408
I can't.

11:48.441 --> 11:52.780
Do you want us
to run aground, woman?

11:52.813 --> 11:55.883
Snorkel shots,
snorkel shots!

11:55.916 --> 11:58.418
snorkel shots!
Snorkel shots,

11:58.451 --> 11:59.953
Snorkel shots!

12:01.321 --> 12:03.290
Woo! Who's next?

12:03.323 --> 12:04.424
Come on, Pammy,
come on, come on!

12:04.457 --> 12:05.492
No, I'm not doing that.

12:05.525 --> 12:06.493
Come on!

12:06.526 --> 12:08.028
Ay ay ay ay ay!

12:08.061 --> 12:09.029
Tequila!

12:09.062 --> 12:10.130
Woo!
Oy!

12:10.163 --> 12:11.298
That's what I'm
talking about.

12:11.331 --> 12:12.299
Hey, why don't we find,

12:12.332 --> 12:14.134
like, a quieter place
to hang out?

12:14.167 --> 12:16.303
You know what, I've just got to
wait for Daryl to do his shot.

12:16.336 --> 12:17.304
Just a minute.

12:17.337 --> 12:19.773
Come on, Daryl, Daryl!

12:19.807 --> 12:21.341
It's getting kind of
rowdy down there.

12:21.374 --> 12:22.442
Yeah.

12:22.475 --> 12:26.847
"Daryl, Daryl, Daryl."

12:26.880 --> 12:31.318
Sometimes I just don't get Roy.

12:31.351 --> 12:34.254
Well.

12:34.287 --> 12:39.326
I mean, I don't know.

12:46.233 --> 12:48.368
So.

12:48.401 --> 12:51.204
What's it like dating
a cheerleader?

12:53.206 --> 12:57.544
Oh...um.

13:17.097 --> 13:20.067
I'm cold.

13:30.110 --> 13:32.245
So, what's this presentation
all about?

13:32.279 --> 13:35.048
Ah, see, this is
of general interest.

13:35.082 --> 13:38.218
It is about...priorities.

13:38.251 --> 13:40.087
And making decisions

13:40.120 --> 13:41.288
using the boat
as an analogy.

13:41.321 --> 13:42.956
What is important
to you?

13:42.990 --> 13:45.558
If the boat is sinking,
what do you save?

13:45.592 --> 13:47.060
Women and children.

13:47.094 --> 13:48.228
No, no.

13:48.261 --> 13:50.230
Salesmen and profit centers.

13:50.263 --> 13:52.099
That's a stupid analogy.

13:52.132 --> 13:54.501
Oh-kay,
well, obviously,

13:54.534 --> 13:57.270
you don't know anything
about leadership.

13:57.304 --> 14:00.240
Well, I was the captain of a
PC-1 Cyclone Coastal Patrol Boat

14:00.273 --> 14:02.175
during Desert Storm.

14:02.209 --> 14:04.644
Wow, you should be
the motivational speaker.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.413
Him, oh-kay.

14:06.446 --> 14:09.316
Yeah, he gives me
real responsibility, Michael.

14:09.349 --> 14:10.918
Captain Jack delegates.

14:10.951 --> 14:13.320
He's let me steer the ship
for the last hour.

14:15.422 --> 14:16.589
I'd like to be engaged.

14:16.623 --> 14:19.392
How did you manage
to pull that off?

14:19.426 --> 14:21.328
Um.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.931
Uh, I've been engaged
for three years

14:23.964 --> 14:25.933
and there's
no end in sight.

14:25.966 --> 14:29.102
So, you don't want
to ask my advice.

14:29.136 --> 14:31.138
Suppose your office
building's on fire.

14:31.171 --> 14:32.139
Jim.

14:32.172 --> 14:33.306
Who would you save?

14:33.340 --> 14:36.376
Um...let's see, uh...

14:38.946 --> 14:40.313
The customer.

14:40.347 --> 14:42.249
'Cause the customer is king.

14:42.282 --> 14:43.917
Not what I was looking for,
but a good thought.

14:43.951 --> 14:45.919
He's just sucking up.

14:45.953 --> 14:47.220
When you were
in the Navy,

14:47.254 --> 14:49.456
did you, um,
ever almost die?

14:49.489 --> 14:51.158
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

14:51.191 --> 14:52.159
And I wasn't
thinking about

14:52.192 --> 14:53.193
some customer.

14:53.226 --> 14:55.295
I was thinking about
my first wife.

14:55.328 --> 14:58.131
The day I got back
on shore, I married her.

15:02.269 --> 15:05.138
You know what, I would
save the receptionist.

15:05.172 --> 15:06.906
I just, wanted to clear that up.

15:10.343 --> 15:13.213
Hey, everybody,

15:13.246 --> 15:15.182
could I have your attention
for just a second?

15:15.215 --> 15:16.183
Would you listen
to me for a second?

15:16.216 --> 15:17.317
Um, we were up
at the front

15:17.350 --> 15:19.519
and we were talking about
what's really important and--

15:19.552 --> 15:22.589
Pam, um...

15:22.622 --> 15:24.124
I think enough is enough.

15:24.157 --> 15:26.226
I think we should set
a date for our wedding.

15:26.259 --> 15:27.727
How about June 10th?

15:27.760 --> 15:29.229
Woo!
Come on, let's do it.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.732
Finally.
Come on, baby!

15:32.765 --> 15:34.234
Oh, my God,
congratulations!

15:34.267 --> 15:36.403
Congratulations.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.505
Yes!

15:38.538 --> 15:39.539
Oh, my God!

15:39.572 --> 15:40.673
I love you, baby.
Come on!

15:40.707 --> 15:42.175
Woo, congratulations!

15:47.680 --> 15:50.517
You know what, I don't want
to take credit for this.

15:50.550 --> 15:53.186
But Roy and I were just
having a conversation

15:53.220 --> 15:58.158
about making commitments
and making choices, right?

15:58.191 --> 15:59.426
Did I motivate you?

15:59.459 --> 16:01.261
No, it was,
it was Captain Jack.

16:01.294 --> 16:02.629
Well--
Captain Jack!

16:02.662 --> 16:05.198
Could have
been either one of us

16:05.232 --> 16:07.134
because, pretty much,
we were saying the same thing.

16:07.167 --> 16:09.236
Congratulations,
that is great.

16:09.269 --> 16:10.737
We gotta celebrate!

16:13.206 --> 16:16.109
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
I got an idea, I got an idea.

16:16.143 --> 16:19.079
I can marry you right now
as captain of the ship, huh?

16:19.112 --> 16:22.649
Yes, I can marry you as Regional
Manager of Dunder Mifflin!

16:22.682 --> 16:25.318
No, no, no, no, I want
my mom and dad to be there.

16:25.352 --> 16:27.254
Then, I'll give you away!

16:27.287 --> 16:29.256
No, thank you.

16:34.727 --> 16:37.330
Do you think that'll
ever be us?

16:37.364 --> 16:40.233
No.

16:40.267 --> 16:41.568
What is wrong
with you?

16:41.601 --> 16:44.104
Why did you even
bring me here tonight?

16:44.137 --> 16:45.472
I don't know.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.440
Let's break up.

16:47.474 --> 16:49.376
Wh

16:49.409 --> 16:53.313
This is where old
Captain Jack drives the boat.

16:53.346 --> 16:55.715
Wow.

16:55.748 --> 16:56.683
Seasick?

16:56.716 --> 16:59.186
Captain Jack says
you should look at the moon.

16:59.219 --> 17:00.520
Captain Jack's a fart face.

17:05.225 --> 17:07.060
I'm on medication.

17:07.094 --> 17:08.261
Really, what?

17:08.295 --> 17:09.662
Vomicillin.

17:12.232 --> 17:15.568
Okay, all right,
it's time to be bossy.

17:15.602 --> 17:17.770
Time to motivate,
let's blow some minds here.

17:17.804 --> 17:20.073
Okay, guys, guys,
guys, cool it.

17:20.107 --> 17:21.174
Everybody.

17:21.208 --> 17:22.442
Dunder Mifflin
and Scranton employees.

17:22.475 --> 17:24.311
Brenda.

17:24.344 --> 17:26.579
I have some very, very urgent
news I need to tell everybody.

17:26.613 --> 17:28.381
Right now, listen up.

17:28.415 --> 17:31.218
The ship...is sinking.

17:31.251 --> 17:33.486
Okay?

17:33.520 --> 17:35.188
We're going down,
right now.

17:35.222 --> 17:37.457
Just wrap your heads around
the reality of that.

17:37.490 --> 17:39.292
What?

17:39.326 --> 17:40.493
Shh, please, everybody,
it's my turn now, okay?

17:40.527 --> 17:42.195
Captain Jack is gone.

17:42.229 --> 17:44.697
In five minutes,
this ship is going to be

17:44.731 --> 17:46.266
at the bottom of the lake.

17:46.299 --> 17:49.736
And there aren't enough spaces
on the lifeboats.

17:49.769 --> 17:51.571
Who are we going to save?

17:51.604 --> 17:53.306
Do we save sales?
No, no!

17:53.340 --> 17:55.342
Do we save
customer service?

17:55.375 --> 17:58.311
Do we save accounting?

17:58.345 --> 17:59.045
This is a business
scenario, right?

17:59.078 --> 18:00.680
Hey, hey!

18:00.713 --> 18:02.315
It's a scary--

18:02.349 --> 18:03.216
What the hell's going on here?
It's a predicament.

18:03.250 --> 18:04.617
Get outta here, what the--

18:04.651 --> 18:06.153
And it's something that
each and every one of us

18:06.186 --> 18:07.720
have to think about.

18:07.754 --> 18:10.457
I'm in the brig, see?

18:10.490 --> 18:15.262
Boat size corporate friendly,
as advertised.

18:15.295 --> 18:16.763
What is the deal with
the guy jumping overboard?

18:16.796 --> 18:17.864
What was--

18:17.897 --> 18:21.734
If he had just waited
and heard what I had to say,

18:21.768 --> 18:24.537
he would be motivated
right now and not all wet.

18:30.277 --> 18:39.352
*

18:39.386 --> 18:43.290
Somebody there?

18:43.323 --> 18:45.458
What happened to you?

18:47.660 --> 18:49.796
Captain Jack
has a problem with authority.

18:49.829 --> 18:53.433
Oh, right, 'cause you announced
that his ship was sinking?

18:53.466 --> 18:56.703
Yeah.
He just totally lost it.

18:56.736 --> 18:59.339
If you ask me,
he caused the panic.

19:03.776 --> 19:06.546
What a night.

19:06.579 --> 19:08.781
Well, it was nice for you.
Your friend got engaged.

19:08.815 --> 19:09.949
She was always engaged.

19:09.982 --> 19:12.185
Roy said the first one
didn't count.

19:12.219 --> 19:15.255
That's...great.

19:17.957 --> 19:21.761
To tell you the truth, I...

19:21.794 --> 19:23.230
used to have
a big thing for Pam.

19:23.263 --> 19:24.864
So.

19:24.897 --> 19:27.900
Really, you're kidding me.

19:27.934 --> 19:29.969
Y

19:30.002 --> 19:32.539
Wow.

19:32.572 --> 19:35.375
I would have never...
put you two together.

19:35.408 --> 19:38.411
You really hid it well, God!

19:38.445 --> 19:40.480
I usually have a radar
for stuff like that.

19:43.383 --> 19:45.318
You know,
I made out with Jan.

19:45.352 --> 19:47.320
Yeah, I know.
Yeah, yup.

19:47.354 --> 19:49.656
Well, Pam is cute.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.591
Yeah.

19:51.624 --> 19:53.660
She's really funny and--

19:53.693 --> 19:56.929
She's warm
and she's just--

19:56.963 --> 19:59.666
Anyway.

19:59.699 --> 20:03.636
Well, if you like her so much,
uh, don't give up.

20:05.672 --> 20:07.740
She's engaged.

20:07.774 --> 20:08.741
Pfft...BFD!

20:08.775 --> 20:10.810
Engaged ain't married.

20:12.779 --> 20:15.282
Huh.

20:15.315 --> 20:18.351
Never, ever, ever give up.

20:23.856 --> 20:25.325
Don't worry, Michael.

20:25.358 --> 20:27.894
I'm taking us to shore!

20:27.927 --> 20:30.263
It's a fake wheel, dummy!

20:30.297 --> 20:32.299
