00:01.190 --> 00:02.619
<i>Previously, on</i>
"Dynasty"...

00:02.707 --> 00:04.579
- FBI. Nobody move.
- What's going on?

00:04.666 --> 00:07.362
Blake Carrington, you're under arrest
for blackmail and coercion.

00:07.450 --> 00:09.165
- What's this?
- Five million dollars

00:09.252 --> 00:11.414
Blake stole from you.
Michael, I'm leaving him.

00:11.501 --> 00:13.667
- Culhane was our best play.
- And the e-mail?

00:13.754 --> 00:16.461
- Adam got into the Atlantix server?
- Without a hitch.

00:16.548 --> 00:19.840
Your son turned me in to the feds.
Want your money? Get your son off my back.

00:19.927 --> 00:21.466
You hear about the guy who painted here?

00:21.553 --> 00:23.260
He's been in the hospital
since he finished.

00:23.347 --> 00:24.636
The paint made you sick?

00:24.723 --> 00:27.347
We take Adam down and put Blake in jail,
where he belongs.

00:27.434 --> 00:29.516
- Are you sure you're in?
- Try keeping me out.

00:30.799 --> 00:32.094
Ow!

00:32.836 --> 00:34.149
I want you to make nice
with your brother.

00:34.236 --> 00:36.258
Haven't I done enough for
your dynasty?

00:36.346 --> 00:38.180
- It's our dynasty.
- No, it's not.

00:38.632 --> 00:40.832
You don't know the first thing
about running a business.

00:40.929 --> 00:42.129
You can find your own way out.

00:53.876 --> 00:54.922
Whoo!

00:57.594 --> 01:00.130
You should take a dip.
The water feels great.

01:00.217 --> 01:01.885
Sure, if you're a water person.

01:01.972 --> 01:04.007
I'm just here for the view.

01:04.096 --> 01:05.695
It's nice to see you smiling again.

01:05.783 --> 01:08.688
- It's nice to be back on top.
- That's what she said.

01:09.101 --> 01:11.141
- Last night, in fact.
- She did.

01:11.228 --> 01:13.162
But I was talking about Femperial

01:13.250 --> 01:15.350
and how I have made this company
a serious contender

01:15.516 --> 01:16.834
by signing my first real author.

01:16.922 --> 01:19.527
- Oh! Thanks, babe.
- JC Remington.

01:19.615 --> 01:20.984
Oh, ouch.

01:22.072 --> 01:25.407
Okay, well, can JC Remington write
a sweeping romantic saga

01:25.495 --> 01:28.172
and look this good in boy shorts?

01:28.495 --> 01:30.205
I doubt it, but I can ask.

01:32.575 --> 01:37.344
I meant how her clout has the ability
to turn this brand into a global empire.

01:37.432 --> 01:39.109
Even on top, she's never satisfied.

01:40.344 --> 01:42.186
Aren't you running the Atlantix
for your family?

01:42.273 --> 01:44.453
Just until the FBI drops the charges
against my dad

01:44.541 --> 01:45.828
and I sell the team back to him.

01:45.916 --> 01:47.132
We're finally in a good place.

01:47.220 --> 01:49.852
We've established our boundaries,
I'm doing well in business,

01:49.940 --> 01:52.477
and he's finally trusting me
over my new brother.

01:52.602 --> 01:54.021
I'd keep an eye on that guy.

01:54.108 --> 01:55.143
Aw.

01:55.230 --> 01:57.422
You're so sweet and so alpha.

01:57.510 --> 01:58.812
I can handle him, too.

01:58.900 --> 02:01.236
You don't need to worry
your pretty little head

02:01.323 --> 02:03.273
about Adam Von Death Trapp.

02:10.454 --> 02:13.707
These secret rendezvous are hot.
I feel like a teenager again.

02:13.794 --> 02:16.043
Funny, I feel like I'm breaking the law.

02:16.543 --> 02:18.128
Yeah, and getting away with it.

02:18.920 --> 02:20.881
It's the greatest aphrodisiac of them all.

02:20.969 --> 02:22.050
Mm-hm.

02:22.723 --> 02:24.968
You know what's the best aphrodisiac?

02:25.055 --> 02:25.882
Mm.

02:25.969 --> 02:28.907
If we could stop pretending
we're not together anymore.

02:29.183 --> 02:31.720
I hate lying to people,
especially to Fallon.

02:31.808 --> 02:34.808
Well, if Fallon had any clue,
she'd go straight to Culhane.

02:34.895 --> 02:36.730
We just have to wait for the FBI
to make a move.

02:36.817 --> 02:38.016
Mm.

02:39.775 --> 02:43.157
I gave the FBI everything they needed
to build a case against Culhane.

02:43.245 --> 02:44.618
What's taking them so long?

02:46.198 --> 02:47.198
Relax.

02:47.616 --> 02:51.244
As soon as they find the e-mail
that Adam planted on the Atlantix server,

02:51.331 --> 02:54.664
it'll lead them to documents
linking Culhane to Ada Stone.

02:55.248 --> 02:58.251
They'll see that she's been paying him
to do her dirty deeds.

02:58.676 --> 03:01.351
And the money you returned will prove it.

03:02.307 --> 03:03.937
We have to be patient.

03:13.120 --> 03:16.555
Oh, Daddy. Oh, thank God.
The doctor's gonna check on you soon.

03:16.643 --> 03:19.383
- Do you need anything?
- Anders, this is all my fault.

03:19.500 --> 03:22.351
If I wouldn't have fought with you,
you wouldn't have had a heart attack.

03:22.438 --> 03:23.467
I almost killed you.

03:23.555 --> 03:26.777
Nonsense. No, no.
Both of you stop fussing, would you?

03:26.865 --> 03:29.574
- I'm gonna be fine.
- Yeah, but are you still you?

03:29.965 --> 03:33.725
Answer this question.
Who's the prime minister of New Zealand?

03:34.280 --> 03:35.949
- Jacinda Ardern.
- Okay.

03:36.037 --> 03:37.921
I should've asked something
I knew the answer to.

03:38.008 --> 03:41.052
Hey, Siri,
who is the prime minister of New Zealand?

03:41.140 --> 03:42.583
Jacinda Ardern.

03:42.671 --> 03:43.752
I need that, please.

03:43.839 --> 03:46.508
I have to call Mr. Carrington
and apologize for my absence.

03:46.595 --> 03:48.374
Putting the Carringtons' needs
before your own.

03:48.461 --> 03:51.014
See? He's himself.
He's gonna be fine.

03:51.758 --> 03:54.983
- Okay if the enemy pays a visit?
- Nonsense.

03:55.071 --> 03:57.287
- Good of you to come, Michael.
- Hey, baby.

03:58.728 --> 04:00.514
That's a little unexpected.

04:00.732 --> 04:02.189
A recent development.

04:02.323 --> 04:05.381
- Don't they make a sexy couple?
- You should see us naked.

04:06.695 --> 04:07.756
Probably an overshare.

04:07.844 --> 04:09.147
Somewhat, yes.

04:09.235 --> 04:11.574
But I'm pleased
that you two are seeing each other,

04:11.662 --> 04:14.295
and it'll be good
to have you around again, Michael.

04:14.383 --> 04:16.764
That means a lot,
and I am glad that you're okay.

04:16.851 --> 04:20.733
Mm. Don't get used to having him around.
Blake banned him from the manor.

04:20.834 --> 04:23.378
- Unless, of course...
- I'm not taking sides, Kirby.

04:23.465 --> 04:26.131
I assure you
that Blake always puts family first.

04:26.218 --> 04:27.975
And we are family.

04:28.998 --> 04:30.090
Whoa, what are you doing?

04:30.177 --> 04:33.223
I appreciate all the support I've had,
but I really must get back to work.

04:33.311 --> 04:34.184
Are you insane?

04:34.272 --> 04:36.143
You were clutching your chest in pain
12 hours ago.

04:36.230 --> 04:38.810
Well, then I owe Mr. Carrington 12 hours,
don't I?

04:38.897 --> 04:41.691
He needs me,
and I need things to get back to normal.

04:41.779 --> 04:44.480
- Yeah, I'm gonna get the doctor.
- Nurse.

04:44.758 --> 04:46.808
Nurse!

04:48.589 --> 04:53.534
Ah. Adam. Are you sleeping
in the crawl space under the stairs now?

04:53.783 --> 04:55.886
Of course not.
I was right outside your door.

04:56.674 --> 04:59.987
So, I have your schedule,
your purse and a banana for the road.

05:00.075 --> 05:02.041
- No.
- Would you like to carpool to the office?

05:02.129 --> 05:03.081
We could,

05:03.181 --> 05:06.438
or I could go alone and you could run
along the side of the car.

05:06.526 --> 05:10.039
I get it. A team owner walking in
with an intern would be weird.

05:10.127 --> 05:12.421
Oh, right.
I keep forgetting you're an intern.

05:12.508 --> 05:15.800
I always remember disgraced team doctor,
but I will work on it.

05:16.020 --> 05:18.517
- I'll see you tonight?
- And every night.

05:28.479 --> 05:32.119
As much as I like
uncomfortable situations, I should go.

05:32.207 --> 05:33.619
And you should, too.

05:33.734 --> 05:36.612
Interns shouldn't arrive at the office
after their boss.

05:37.446 --> 05:38.704
Thanks for the tip.

05:38.816 --> 05:42.001
You're awfully business savvy
for a romance novelist.

05:43.608 --> 05:46.661
Hey, look, about that whole dustup
we had last night?

05:46.749 --> 05:49.852
Can we put it behind us and move forward?

05:50.698 --> 05:54.555
After all, if you're important to Fallon,
you're important to me.

05:58.372 --> 06:00.852
So, why do I feel
like I've been marked for death?

06:01.941 --> 06:04.872
Don't be silly. I would never kill you.

06:16.015 --> 06:19.330
So? Did that painter Skip and I
have the same symptoms?

06:20.807 --> 06:24.328
Mr. Colby, I would normally never betray
doctor-patient confidentiality...

06:24.416 --> 06:26.327
Look, I need to know now
if Skip and I were poisoned

06:26.414 --> 06:29.399
by the same substance so I can track it
and connect it to our culprit.

06:29.487 --> 06:32.251
Where the poison came from
is not your biggest problem.

06:32.547 --> 06:34.936
What it's doing to your nervous system is.

06:35.523 --> 06:38.338
- What?
- Please, sit down.

06:39.660 --> 06:42.412
Do you know what neurotoxicity is?

06:42.500 --> 06:44.510
No, but I don't like the way it sounds.

06:44.598 --> 06:47.635
Your brain cells are turning
against one another,

06:47.755 --> 06:50.282
causing significant cognitive dysfunction.

06:50.370 --> 06:53.176
Well, I don't need anything messing
with my brain, okay?

06:53.264 --> 06:55.626
So, let's just get going
with the treatment

06:55.721 --> 06:57.152
and knock it the hell out of me.

06:57.445 --> 06:58.871
There is no treatment.

06:59.650 --> 07:02.213
All I can do is help manage your symptoms.

07:02.979 --> 07:05.594
- Which are?
- You may likely have trouble

07:05.682 --> 07:08.125
with verbal recall, delayed motor skills,

07:08.213 --> 07:10.790
perhaps a significant drop
in attention span.

07:10.974 --> 07:12.690
You'll still be able to function.

07:12.867 --> 07:15.211
Wait, wait, wait, how is that functioning?

07:15.450 --> 07:17.465
It may be a difficult adjustment.

07:19.370 --> 07:21.903
If you'd like to bring your family in,
I can explain to them...

07:21.991 --> 07:23.151
Wait, no, no, no.

07:23.239 --> 07:26.496
You can't say a word about this to anyone.
Understood?

07:28.347 --> 07:30.395
I'll deal with this my own way.

07:31.653 --> 07:35.213
Poor Anders. Are you sure he's okay?
I'll get him something.

07:35.301 --> 07:38.898
- Does Chanel make a defibrillator?
- Well, if they do, send it to the manor.

07:38.986 --> 07:41.267
He was fighting the doctor to leave
when you picked me up.

07:41.396 --> 07:44.570
Ugh. And this all happened
just after he went Sam's hotel?

07:44.658 --> 07:47.427
PS. Have we discussed that insanity yet?

07:47.515 --> 07:50.894
Uh, no, and forget about Sam.
We need to get to Femperial right now.

07:50.982 --> 07:53.815
My phone is blowing up with messages
from our office.

07:53.903 --> 07:56.166
They're not happy
about Blake's latest scandal.

07:56.254 --> 07:57.883
Oh, well, tell them to get in line.

07:57.971 --> 08:00.696
They're upset
that you're the face of his company

08:00.784 --> 08:02.477
and the face of your company.

08:02.565 --> 08:05.470
Guess they're having a hard time seeing
the difference between your two faces.

08:05.557 --> 08:07.977
Ah. Comic relief. Not a good look on you.

08:09.337 --> 08:11.266
JC just texted to me.
She said,

08:11.354 --> 08:13.314
"If Fallon is afraid to take a stand
against her father

08:13.401 --> 08:14.501
and everything he represents,

08:14.588 --> 08:16.291
I'll have no choice
but to take my own stand

08:16.378 --> 08:18.383
and leave Femperial,
effective immediately"?

08:18.471 --> 08:21.743
It was just bribery charges.
It's not like he went full Madoff.

08:21.838 --> 08:23.619
It's not about the bribery scandal.

08:23.737 --> 08:25.441
It's about his violent behavior
toward women.

08:25.528 --> 08:28.276
That door slam on Cristal is blowing up
on social media,

08:28.364 --> 08:30.230
and you're still representing him
at the Atlantix.

08:30.317 --> 08:33.525
I can't give up the team until the charges
against my father are dropped.

08:33.614 --> 08:37.424
- And I refuse to give up Femperial.
- You have to choose between the two.

08:37.511 --> 08:39.928
You have to distance yourself from him
and give up Atlantix

08:40.015 --> 08:41.544
or you're gonna lose Femperial.

08:41.633 --> 08:45.479
I think you're making too much of this.
Trust me, I can handle the situation.

08:46.657 --> 08:51.985
<i>Boycott Femperial!</i>
<i>Boycott Femperial! Boycott Femperial!</i>

08:52.742 --> 08:54.118
What the hell?

08:54.252 --> 08:59.078
<i>Boycott Femperial! Boycott Femperial!
Boycott Femperial!</i>

08:59.166 --> 09:00.722
You sure this won't be a problem?

09:00.810 --> 09:03.651
Ah. I may have underestimated it
a little bit.

09:03.739 --> 09:05.336
- Excuse me.
<i>- Boycott Femperial!</i>

09:05.424 --> 09:07.890
- Hi.
<i>- Boycott Femperial!</i>

09:08.615 --> 09:12.250
<i>Boycott Femperial! Boycott Femperial!
Boycott Femperial!</i>

09:12.505 --> 09:15.375
Okay, I underestimated this a lot.

09:15.463 --> 09:18.060

Episode Title :
<font color=#FFFF00>"Deception, Jealousy and Lies"</font>

09:44.882 --> 09:47.513
You left without saying goodbye.
The least you could've done

09:47.600 --> 09:50.632
is left me a bottle
of whatever miracle-grow shampoo you use.

09:50.875 --> 09:53.695
I'm sorry. Things ended quickly
between your father and I.

09:53.783 --> 09:56.771
Yes, and now I have to either defend
or denounce him

09:56.859 --> 09:58.001
in the court of public opinion.

09:58.088 --> 09:59.835
Why? This isn't about you.

09:59.923 --> 10:01.141
Oh, but it is.

10:01.250 --> 10:03.343
The Femperial authors
are threatening to walk

10:03.431 --> 10:04.625
unless I can prove that

10:04.713 --> 10:06.530
Blake isn't the monster that
people think he is.

10:06.617 --> 10:08.515
Okay, the car door was an accident.

10:08.603 --> 10:10.578
- Is that what you wanted to hear?
- Yes.

10:10.666 --> 10:13.015
And God help me,
but has he ever touched you

10:13.103 --> 10:15.595
in a not-so-friendly
<i>Big Little Lies </i> sort of way?

10:15.690 --> 10:18.493
No, no, Fallon,
your father was never abusive.

10:18.581 --> 10:22.013
Would you mind stating that on the record
at a press conference I'm holding today?

10:22.101 --> 10:23.478
No, I can't.

10:23.566 --> 10:27.790
I won't defend Blake when I know
what he's trying to do to my father.

10:28.191 --> 10:31.638
Well, I figured that might be your answer,
and I don't blame you.

10:31.726 --> 10:34.443
I'll just put on
my most proletarian-looking Miu Mius

10:34.531 --> 10:35.877
and I'll do it myself.

10:37.632 --> 10:39.071
Fallon.

10:40.062 --> 10:41.696
I am sorry.

10:42.564 --> 10:45.774
I was looking forward
to having you as a step-mom.

10:46.401 --> 10:48.481
And if the next one is also named Cristal,

10:48.569 --> 10:51.455
then, I might have to throw myself
down a flight of stairs.

10:55.554 --> 10:58.107
If they're letting him go,
that's a good thing.

10:58.195 --> 10:59.455
Relax, Kirby.

10:59.543 --> 11:01.765
You'll take care of him,
I'll take care of you.

11:01.853 --> 11:04.196
All right, how about dinner tonight,
my house,

11:04.317 --> 11:05.534
I'll see you at 7?

11:05.727 --> 11:07.579
All right, it's a date.

11:07.667 --> 11:08.876
Hey.

11:09.401 --> 11:11.180
You're not seriously dating Kirby.

11:11.268 --> 11:13.901
If it was any of your business,
which it isn't,

11:13.992 --> 11:15.814
you said she could date
whoever she wanted.

11:15.918 --> 11:19.368
Yeah, that was before I knew
you were gonna Fredo my father to the FBI.

11:19.456 --> 11:22.603
So, you love Blake again this week?
Not everyone agrees with you.

11:22.691 --> 11:25.831
Even Cristal came to me confessing
all the horrible things he did.

11:25.919 --> 11:28.427
- He's getting what he deserves.
- But Kirby isn't.

11:28.515 --> 11:31.703
She's too young and naive
to realize the mistake she's making.

11:31.791 --> 11:34.171
But I'm not. End it, now.

11:34.274 --> 11:37.661
Whoa, whoa, dial it down, Don Corleone.
Kirby's a big girl.

11:37.749 --> 11:38.801
She can date who she wants.

11:38.888 --> 11:40.232
She doesn't know
what she wants.

11:40.320 --> 11:43.321
Really?
Well, she certainly did last night.

11:57.507 --> 11:59.473
What the hell are you doing in here?

11:59.561 --> 12:02.198
I brought you your mail
and a fresh cup of coffee.

12:02.286 --> 12:03.321
Too soon?

12:03.409 --> 12:06.295
I'm this close to hurling it at your head.
I hope it's hot.

12:06.383 --> 12:08.531
The press is gathered
in the conference room.

12:08.619 --> 12:10.174
They're waiting for a statement
from Cristal.

12:10.261 --> 12:11.618
Cristal is a no-show.

12:11.714 --> 12:13.933
Tell everybody
I'll be standing in with Blake.

12:14.021 --> 12:16.845
- Copy that, boss.
- Get out.

12:35.039 --> 12:37.782
Oh, good, you're home.
How was your checkup?

12:38.757 --> 12:42.893
Jeff? Did you get any evidence
that Adam was behind this?

12:42.981 --> 12:44.995
What happened, Jeff? Talk to us.

12:45.185 --> 12:48.238
What did the doctor say?
Can we go to the cops now?

12:48.509 --> 12:50.046
What's the use?

12:51.920 --> 12:55.186
I could spend the rest of my life
trying to prove Adam poisoned me.

12:55.285 --> 12:59.046
Even if I did, Blake would just find
some way to cover it up.

12:59.290 --> 13:01.762
I don't understand.
Does this mean you're giving up?

13:03.144 --> 13:04.490
It means that, uh...

13:08.233 --> 13:09.787
That I'm changing tactics.

13:09.875 --> 13:12.932
Adam thinks he can come at me
and walk away clean?

13:13.216 --> 13:15.359
Not even Blake Carrington's all-powerful.

13:15.447 --> 13:18.596
He and his bastard son
are gonna get what's coming to them.

13:19.546 --> 13:21.002
Even if it kills me.

13:29.236 --> 13:30.712
I just talked to my agent.

13:30.809 --> 13:34.096
Heard the female contingent
at Femperial wants to walk.

13:35.385 --> 13:38.932
- Hey, look, don't worry. I wouldn't.
- Worried? Me? No.

13:39.072 --> 13:41.260
No, never. But this is funny.

13:41.480 --> 13:42.757
Isn't it?

13:43.685 --> 13:45.894
- I don't get it.
- It's a letter about you.

13:45.982 --> 13:51.188
I thought it was from your agent or a fan,
but turns out it's way better than that.

13:51.276 --> 13:54.896
Apparently, you have a 10-year-old child
out in the world?

13:55.887 --> 13:57.689
- That's crazy, huh?
- Fallon, I...

13:57.896 --> 13:59.325
Could you just please tell me

13:59.413 --> 14:01.715
that whoever wrote this
"I know who you did last summer"

14:01.803 --> 14:04.050
is just playing a sick prank?

14:05.832 --> 14:07.115
Please?

14:09.711 --> 14:11.091
It's true.

14:12.344 --> 14:14.724
Look, I was in high school
studying abroad.

14:14.883 --> 14:17.761
We were not ready to be parents,
so my family decided the best thing to do

14:17.848 --> 14:20.066
was to have the baby
and put it up for adoption.

14:20.154 --> 14:22.122
Why didn't you tell me this before?

14:22.226 --> 14:25.177
'Cause I never had any ties to the mother
or child since.

14:25.265 --> 14:28.726
And over time, it was just something
that I buried in my mind.

14:28.869 --> 14:33.605
Fallon, I am sorry. I should've told you.
But it's not a part of my life in any way.

14:33.693 --> 14:36.529
- Yes, but it is a part of mine now.
- Okay, I get that.

14:38.115 --> 14:39.849
- So, let's talk.
- No, I can't talk.

14:39.953 --> 14:42.948
I have a press conference to run
and a soccer team to run

14:43.036 --> 14:44.508
and a publishing company to run.

14:44.596 --> 14:48.066
This is the last thing
I have time to deal with right now. Sorry.

15:01.959 --> 15:03.063
Good afternoon.

15:03.181 --> 15:06.535
I am here to address recent rumors
involving my father,

15:06.623 --> 15:08.669
Blake Carrington, and Cristal Jennings.

15:08.757 --> 15:10.046
I just spoke to Cristal,

15:10.134 --> 15:13.540
and she assured me that the incident
under question was an accident

15:13.628 --> 15:14.897
and not a case of abuse.

15:14.985 --> 15:16.742
Why isn't Ms. Jennings here
to speak for herself?

15:16.829 --> 15:21.807
Well, she asks that we respect her privacy
but urged me to set the record straight.

15:21.895 --> 15:25.245
Blake Carrington is not
and has never been a violent man.

15:25.333 --> 15:29.436
Personally, his admiration and respect
for women has played a large role

15:29.524 --> 15:31.288
in shaping the person I am today.

15:31.376 --> 15:34.301
Thank you for support
during this ordeal.

15:34.585 --> 15:36.364
And thank you to my daughter.

15:36.452 --> 15:37.971
There's nothing more important
than family...

15:38.058 --> 15:40.028
How do you explain a report
released moments ago

15:40.116 --> 15:42.373
that three former
Carrington Atlantic employees

15:42.461 --> 15:45.524
have come forward accusing you
of physical assault in the workplace?

15:45.923 --> 15:47.713
- Excuse me?
- Were you aware of these allegations?

15:47.800 --> 15:49.848
Have you sought treatment
for your anger issues?

15:50.017 --> 15:52.129
Uh, thank you.
We have no more time for questions.

15:52.217 --> 15:53.424
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

15:53.511 --> 15:56.532
Do you have a comment
about these allegations?

16:02.311 --> 16:04.311
Oh. Surprised you're still here.

16:04.406 --> 16:07.280
I mean, after that epic fail
of a press conference,

16:07.368 --> 16:09.968
I figured you'd be busy
helping Daddy lick his wounds.

16:10.056 --> 16:12.945
I'm a little busy for your brand
of pettiness today, so...

16:13.033 --> 16:16.545
Busy? Busy doing what? Fetching coffee?

16:17.117 --> 16:21.492
I mean, from golden boy to intern.
It's quite the fall from grace.

16:21.580 --> 16:24.341
But turns out
you haven't hit rock bottom yet.

16:24.541 --> 16:27.469
I, uh, rounded up all the owners
currently at the office,

16:27.557 --> 16:29.071
and we took a vote.

16:29.338 --> 16:31.540
- You're fired.
- Oh, Jeff.

16:31.715 --> 16:34.104
Are you sick and feeling delusional again?

16:34.571 --> 16:37.335
Now that your crook of a father
is no longer in charge,

16:37.423 --> 16:40.069
the board is reevaluating
his previous decisions.

16:40.269 --> 16:42.640
Given your outburst on opening day,

16:42.728 --> 16:44.852
we feel it's best
you no longer work for the team.

16:44.940 --> 16:47.666
Well, we'll see about that.
My family still has majority ownership.

16:47.754 --> 16:50.358
No, no, see,
Fallon has majority ownership,

16:50.446 --> 16:52.014
and she hates you, too.

16:52.102 --> 16:55.251
Your only ally is about to go to prison.

16:56.156 --> 16:58.908
You're helpless without Daddy Warbucks
by your side,

16:58.996 --> 17:00.292
ready to wipe your a...

17:00.380 --> 17:02.768
Hey. You watch your mouth.

17:02.856 --> 17:04.051
Ooh.

17:04.140 --> 17:08.239
I do hope you enjoy your weekly visits
to him in the slammer.

17:08.961 --> 17:10.913
Maybe you can be his intern.

17:11.001 --> 17:13.712
Bring him his cigarettes, maybe a shiv.

17:14.383 --> 17:15.806
Don't touch me.

17:16.728 --> 17:18.171
You ungrateful son of a bitch.

17:18.259 --> 17:20.609
My father did everything for you.

17:33.861 --> 17:37.625
Your threats mean nothing to me, Adam.
You're still fired.

17:46.123 --> 17:47.717
You let me publicly defend you

17:47.805 --> 17:50.170
when you're just another
misogynistic monster.

17:50.258 --> 17:51.540
I have a temper. You know that.

17:51.628 --> 17:55.711
But throwing a stapler at a wall
a time or two is not equal to abuse.

17:55.799 --> 17:58.912
You made me look like a liar and, worse,
an abuser sympathizer.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.006
My company, my entire brand,

18:01.094 --> 18:03.975
is specifically, about giving women a voice
after they've been silenced.

18:04.063 --> 18:07.223
Here I am, the daughter of a man
who is trying to silence them.

18:07.311 --> 18:08.686
What do you want me to say?

18:08.774 --> 18:10.726
I want you to say,
"It's a deal,"

18:10.814 --> 18:14.037
when I tell you I am selling
my Atlantix stake back to you.

18:14.308 --> 18:15.606
You can't do that.

18:15.694 --> 18:17.462
The league won't
allow me ownership

18:17.550 --> 18:19.319
until the feds drop the charges
against me.

18:19.407 --> 18:21.571
- I'd lose the team. You know that.
- That's your problem.

18:21.658 --> 18:23.780
My problem is saving Femperial,

18:23.868 --> 18:26.466
which I can do
once I sell the team back to you.

18:27.464 --> 18:28.743
Fallon.

18:29.358 --> 18:31.703
My back is up against the wall here.

18:32.711 --> 18:37.875
I'm about to lose everything.
I lost Carrington Atlantic because of you.

18:38.795 --> 18:40.235
I lost my dad...

18:40.977 --> 18:43.430
and then Celia and Steven.

18:43.931 --> 18:48.347
This team has helped me rebuild my life.
It's not just a business.

18:48.435 --> 18:49.453
It's a purpose.

18:49.541 --> 18:54.071
Now with Cristal leaving,
I don't have anyone else to turn to.

18:54.650 --> 18:56.061
What am I supposed to do?

18:56.149 --> 18:59.319
Sacrifice my dreams
to protect you from growing another beard?

18:59.407 --> 19:02.789
No, I want you to protect this family
from burning to the ground.

19:03.533 --> 19:05.110
Come work with me again.

19:05.202 --> 19:09.110
This time,
we'll build our legacy as a true team,

19:09.289 --> 19:10.813
equal partners...

19:13.085 --> 19:15.211
creating our dynasty.

19:30.764 --> 19:32.524
What are you doing here?

19:49.144 --> 19:51.085
I'm not familiar with that song.

19:52.049 --> 19:54.172
It's called "Ode to a Hot Mess."

19:54.260 --> 19:56.678
- Mozart, I think.
- I heard about the press conference.

19:56.766 --> 20:00.208
Ah. Yes,
my other terrible performance.

20:00.296 --> 20:02.200
That's actually the least of my
worries, right now.

20:02.287 --> 20:05.679
Blake asked me to give up
Femperial to come work with him.

20:05.886 --> 20:06.961
Wow.

20:07.532 --> 20:09.759
How quickly did you say no?

20:09.971 --> 20:13.144
- I haven't.
- Why would you go back to working for him?

20:13.232 --> 20:16.665
Because we would be working together.
He wants me to be his partner.

20:17.421 --> 20:19.439
Fallon, is it really that different?

20:20.088 --> 20:22.382
I mean, hey, look, I get it.
Family's family.

20:22.477 --> 20:25.156
When mine's, you know,
trying to ruin my life,

20:25.244 --> 20:26.822
I still wanna please them.

20:27.492 --> 20:28.786
So, you're not helping me decide.

20:28.873 --> 20:31.884
I think whatever you decide
will be the right decision.

20:32.599 --> 20:36.314
And I will be by your side
watching you no matter what.

20:37.365 --> 20:40.602
'Cause I love you,
no matter what.

20:47.191 --> 20:48.908
I really hope you mean that.

20:50.394 --> 20:52.454
Since yesterday,
I can't stop thinking about...

20:52.542 --> 20:54.794
I messed up.
Okay, I'm sorry...

20:54.882 --> 20:57.611
No, no, no.
It's not that.

20:58.598 --> 21:00.433
If you're gonna be honest with me...

21:01.655 --> 21:03.782
then there's something
I need to tell you.

21:04.400 --> 21:07.665
Something that happened to me
when I was in high school.

21:09.455 --> 21:11.220
When I was 16...

21:12.004 --> 21:13.501
I got into a fight

21:13.638 --> 21:15.488
with one of my
friends, Beatrice Tate.

21:15.677 --> 21:17.712
She made all of us call her Trixie.

21:17.800 --> 21:19.165
Anyway...

21:20.227 --> 21:25.133
it was really late,
and we were both really, really drunk.

21:25.221 --> 21:27.386
- Come on. You don't have to go.
- No.

21:27.473 --> 21:29.213
<i>I don't remember
what we were fighting about.</i>

21:29.300 --> 21:30.514
<i>It was all a blur.</i>

21:30.601 --> 21:31.682
- Hey.
- Let go of me.

21:31.769 --> 21:33.306
Trixie!

21:35.233 --> 21:37.819
- Stop. You can't drive home.
- Let go of me.

21:37.907 --> 21:40.148
No, you can't go.
I'm not letting you go.

21:40.236 --> 21:43.072
You're too drunk. You're too drunk.
I'm not letting...

21:54.010 --> 21:56.623
It was an accident,
but sometimes I don't know.

21:56.711 --> 21:59.293
I went to Anders for help,
and he told me he would take care of it.

21:59.380 --> 22:01.545
I never really knew what that meant.
I didn't ask.

22:01.632 --> 22:03.339
I don't think I wanted to know.
I just buried it.

22:03.426 --> 22:04.726
And then the next day, the whole world

22:04.813 --> 22:07.736
just thought that Trixie ran away.

22:08.598 --> 22:10.118
And that was it.

22:11.712 --> 22:14.225
It's so bad,
and I totally don't blame you

22:14.313 --> 22:16.131
if you wanna walk away
and never look back.

22:16.219 --> 22:18.258
No, no, no. Hey, hey.

22:20.307 --> 22:22.165
I'm not going anywhere.

22:23.133 --> 22:25.063
I'm here for you, remember?

22:26.036 --> 22:27.618
No matter what.

22:40.525 --> 22:42.212
Where did you go so early?

22:43.132 --> 22:46.624
- You're supposed to be in bed, resting.
- I appreciate your concern,

22:46.712 --> 22:49.376
but Blake had some business
he needed me to attend to.

22:49.766 --> 22:52.769
I know you call that loyalty,
but I call that stupidity.

22:52.857 --> 22:55.682
It is loyalty.
And it goes both ways.

22:55.770 --> 22:58.071
Who do you think provides
the lifestyle we enjoy?

22:58.159 --> 23:00.295
Blake has been taking
care of me for decades.

23:00.383 --> 23:02.475
Now he's taking care of you.
Don't you forget it.

23:02.563 --> 23:06.072
If he cares about you so much,
why didn't he visit you in the hospital?

23:06.913 --> 23:10.280
We have no idea the pressure
and responsibilities he has.

23:10.368 --> 23:13.798
He doesn't have the luxury of
dropping everything for a sick call.

23:13.886 --> 23:15.087
It's not about luxury.

23:15.175 --> 23:17.485
It's about being a
considerate human being.

23:17.573 --> 23:21.391
Both Sam and I came to see you
because we actually care about you.

23:21.714 --> 23:25.618
Blake needs you.
Don't kid yourself that he cares.

23:34.451 --> 23:35.469
Excuse me.

23:35.557 --> 23:38.892
Um, I'm looking for my son, Jeff Colby?
Have you seen him?

23:38.980 --> 23:40.227
He didn't come home last night.

23:40.314 --> 23:42.521
I've been calling,
but he isn't answering his phone.

23:42.608 --> 23:44.110
He hasn't come in today.

23:45.734 --> 23:47.209
He and Adam Carrington,

23:47.297 --> 23:49.508
they got into a nasty fight
about something.

23:51.242 --> 23:53.324
I need to report a missing person.

23:53.411 --> 23:56.670
My son hasn't come home,
hasn't been responding to calls.

23:57.369 --> 23:59.904
Something's wrong. I can feel it.

24:01.692 --> 24:03.068
Oh, God.

24:10.662 --> 24:12.358
Can you stop rowing for a second?

24:12.448 --> 24:14.272
Oh, sure thing, captain.

24:14.463 --> 24:16.131
I just wanna take it all in.

24:17.122 --> 24:20.600
- Yeah? What part?
- All of it. But mostly you.

24:20.688 --> 24:23.811
All this forced introspection
has made me look at us, too,

24:23.899 --> 24:25.287
and everything we've survived.

24:25.375 --> 24:27.779
A fake marriage,
a fake divorce,

24:27.867 --> 24:32.834
our moms, your pervy uncle,
a basic ex-girlfriend, Twitter trolls...

24:33.805 --> 24:38.553
and now the scariest test of all:
our pasts.

24:38.748 --> 24:40.671
But I think that
if we can survive that,

24:40.764 --> 24:44.061
we can do anything... together.

24:46.027 --> 24:50.201
It has been one wild ride,
there's no doubt about that.

24:50.718 --> 24:52.467
But I wouldn't change any of it.

24:52.737 --> 24:56.013
It would take me
a lifetime... to repay you

24:56.164 --> 24:58.568
for everything that
you've done for me.

25:00.472 --> 25:02.318
And I'd like the chance to try.

25:04.265 --> 25:05.654
If you'll let me.

25:10.208 --> 25:15.861
Jack Liam Ridley Lowden
Van Kirk Southside...

25:15.949 --> 25:17.497
That's close enough.

25:20.581 --> 25:23.237
- Is that my dad's ring? How did you...?
- Mm-hm.

25:23.325 --> 25:25.582
I might have paid a maid to
steal it from your mom's house,

25:25.669 --> 25:27.042
but let's save the Q and A for after.

25:27.129 --> 25:29.161
I'm kind of in the middle
of something here.

25:29.767 --> 25:31.068
Liam...

25:32.423 --> 25:33.896
marry me.

25:34.306 --> 25:35.841
For real this time.

25:36.877 --> 25:38.341
Is that a question?

25:38.544 --> 25:41.286
- Is that a yes?
- No.

25:42.520 --> 25:44.489
It's a hell, yes.

26:10.750 --> 26:12.501
Aw. How nice.

26:12.589 --> 26:15.057
My baby sister and her boyfriend,
happy again.

26:15.145 --> 26:17.693
I don't see a boyfriend,
but I do see a fiancé.

26:17.781 --> 26:18.806
We'd invite you to the wedding,

26:18.893 --> 26:21.039
but we have to keep
the guest list under 800. So...

26:21.127 --> 26:22.636
Oh, don't be sad, Adam.

26:22.724 --> 26:24.463
If you play nice,
we'll consider you for ring bearer.

26:24.550 --> 26:26.989
You know, once you're potty trained.

26:27.875 --> 26:29.905
So, I'm gonna have
a new brother-in-law.

26:29.993 --> 26:34.094
Yeah. One who'll make sure you keep the
inappropriate kissing to yourself.

26:35.495 --> 26:36.992
So, where's the ring?

26:37.992 --> 26:40.211
- Uh...
- Is the writing career not taking off?

26:40.352 --> 26:42.794
Don't worry, it's 2019.
Women can be breadwinners too.

26:42.881 --> 26:44.254
Yes, and they can propose.

26:44.341 --> 26:49.305
Not that it's any of your business,
but I, um... I lost the ring.

26:49.416 --> 26:51.835
But I promise I will get it back
somehow, okay?

26:51.973 --> 26:53.490
I'm very, very, very sorry.

26:53.578 --> 26:56.883
It's okay.
Just make sure the next one floats.

26:57.562 --> 26:59.100
I think I'm gonna go change.

26:59.188 --> 27:02.656
I worked up a sweat
with all that... rowing.

27:03.038 --> 27:05.313
Adam, why don't you take the day off?

27:05.401 --> 27:07.456
Hell, take the week.
Nobody'll miss you.

27:12.748 --> 27:15.201
My room was supposed to
be ready 20 minutes ago.

27:15.288 --> 27:17.524
- What's the problem?
- Please hold.

27:17.769 --> 27:21.100
Ma'am, I know, but Housekeeping's
running a little bit behind.

27:21.188 --> 27:23.664
If you give me one minute,
I can sort it out for you. Okay?

27:23.752 --> 27:24.938
Excuse me. Mr. Jones.

27:25.026 --> 27:26.503
- If I may?
- Anders.

27:26.591 --> 27:28.259
Apologies, ma'am, for the delay,

27:28.399 --> 27:31.125
but our suites take a little longer
to prepare than the rooms,

27:31.213 --> 27:33.610
and you've been upgraded
as a valued guest.

27:33.698 --> 27:37.160
- A suite. Well, that does sound nice.
- Mm-hm.

27:37.394 --> 27:40.318
If you'd please enjoy a
complimentary drink at the bar

27:40.406 --> 27:41.539
while we get the room ready.

27:41.627 --> 27:43.639
- And thank you for your patience.
- Thank you.

27:43.727 --> 27:44.883
No, thank you.

27:47.868 --> 27:51.555
You're a genius. Thanks, Anders.
Diego was a no-show.

27:51.783 --> 27:54.239
I didn't think running a hotel
was gonna be this hard,

27:54.327 --> 27:56.070
which I know sounds ridiculous.

27:56.158 --> 27:58.850
Well, I'm proud of you for taking
a chance on yourself,

27:58.938 --> 28:00.662
for stepping outside
your comfort zone.

28:00.750 --> 28:02.477
Well, I wish
I had your mad skills.

28:02.584 --> 28:04.484
I think I need to get myself an Anders.

28:04.587 --> 28:07.360
Well, what a coincidence.
This one's available.

28:07.465 --> 28:09.339
Uh... for the right price.

28:09.426 --> 28:12.055
But what about the Carringtons?
And your health?

28:12.143 --> 28:13.307
And the Carringtons?

28:13.395 --> 28:16.520
Well, I appreciate your concern,
but I am fine.

28:16.725 --> 28:18.139
And for the Carringtons,

28:18.227 --> 28:20.625
well, maybe it's time
I stepped out of my comfort zone.

28:21.449 --> 28:23.490
Would you be the hotel's majordomo?

28:23.578 --> 28:25.422
Or does that only apply
in mansions?

28:25.531 --> 28:28.084
- I'm sure we can come up with a new title.
- Mm.

28:28.172 --> 28:31.526
One favor. Let's not tell
Mr. Carrington just yet.

28:31.614 --> 28:34.530
I need to find my successor
so there's a smooth transition.

28:34.617 --> 28:37.156
And I want to leave the
mansion on good terms.

28:37.786 --> 28:38.786
- Okay.
- Thank you.

28:39.160 --> 28:40.194
Hi.

28:46.476 --> 28:48.943
Reverend Doyle.
Wow, what a surprise.

28:49.031 --> 28:51.000
I haven't seen you
since Grandpa's funeral.

28:51.088 --> 28:54.007
- Yes, it has been a while.
- Why the special house visit?

28:54.095 --> 28:56.222
Is Daddy in need of
some extra prayers?

28:56.310 --> 28:58.345
Um... Well, it's, um...

28:58.433 --> 29:00.977
You look like you'd rather be
swallowed up by the gates of hell.

29:01.065 --> 29:03.165
Come on. Tell me why you're here.
And don't lie to me.

29:03.252 --> 29:04.727
It's not the Christian thing to do.

29:04.815 --> 29:08.281
Reverend, we go all the way back
to my confirmation, remember?

29:09.569 --> 29:12.258
I'm here to marry
your father and Cristal.

29:12.400 --> 29:14.278
What? Well, that can't be.

29:14.366 --> 29:16.623
Blake and Cristal split up.
I just spoke to her yesterday.

29:16.710 --> 29:18.545
She's probably on her way
to Mexico right now.

29:18.640 --> 29:21.477
Or she could have found
forgiveness.

29:21.606 --> 29:24.116
It's the foundation
of a lasting union.

29:24.221 --> 29:28.809
Yes, I can see how a bed of lies
can provide a solid foundation.

29:31.790 --> 29:32.972
- Hi.
- Uh.

29:33.060 --> 29:35.623
Here to take a swing at my other cheek?
'Cause I'm not turning it.

29:35.710 --> 29:38.218
Oh, I'd love to,
but we have a situation here.

29:38.306 --> 29:40.502
Yesterday you told me
Cristal came to see you?

29:40.590 --> 29:43.424
- Right. Before you slapped me.
- Yes, I remember.

29:43.512 --> 29:46.898
So, you said that she confessed
to all the horrible things Blake did?

29:47.518 --> 29:50.731
Yeah. She was mad at him
for turning against her father.

29:50.819 --> 29:52.146
That's exactly
what she said to me,

29:52.233 --> 29:55.360
except I just found out they
are getting married, in secret.

29:55.448 --> 29:56.779
That doesn't make any sense.

29:56.866 --> 29:59.661
Cristal even went to the FBI to
corroborate their case against Blake.

29:59.749 --> 30:01.325
Unless that's just what
she wanted you to think.

30:01.412 --> 30:02.630
Did she say anything else?

30:02.718 --> 30:05.278
No, but she did return the money
Ada gave me,

30:05.403 --> 30:07.010
whole 5 million that Blake stole.

30:07.098 --> 30:09.250
Blake would've never
kept that money from Ada.

30:09.337 --> 30:13.567
If they wanted to hurt me,
then why'd they give me the money?

30:14.299 --> 30:17.424
'Cause, the best way to prove his innocence
is to find another suspect.

30:17.512 --> 30:19.886
They're trying to frame me.
Son of a bitch.

30:19.973 --> 30:22.338
Okay. Michael, you need
to burn that cash

30:22.426 --> 30:25.099
before the FBI raids this place
and catches you with it.

30:25.186 --> 30:27.018
Never thought I'd burn
through money so quick.

30:27.105 --> 30:29.604
Well, roast some marshmallows
while you're at it.

30:29.691 --> 30:32.356
Now I have to go deal
with my wretched father.

30:34.473 --> 30:37.872
And, Michael... I really am sorry.

30:39.370 --> 30:40.801
For everything.

30:46.455 --> 30:49.002
Uh...
I think it's near the center.

30:49.090 --> 30:50.862
Sorry, I know I'm not being specific.

30:50.950 --> 30:52.585
I'm a little bit nautically challenged.

30:52.672 --> 30:54.045
Don't worry. We'll find it.

30:54.132 --> 30:55.421
We got two other guys on the way.

30:55.508 --> 30:57.669
Yeah. With our sonar,
we can find anything.

30:57.757 --> 30:58.885
Great. Thank you so much.

30:58.973 --> 31:01.184
This ring means so much
to me and my family, so...

31:01.279 --> 31:04.012
What's going on?
You looking for buried treasure?

31:04.100 --> 31:06.784
Kind of. I hired these guys
to find Fallon's ring

31:06.872 --> 31:08.184
that she dropped in the lake.

31:08.271 --> 31:11.316
- Consider it a wedding gift.
- Oh, Adam, that is too generous.

31:12.011 --> 31:14.645
Especially since you
already sent Fallon a gift.

31:15.526 --> 31:17.200
That anonymous letter?

31:17.692 --> 31:19.731
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

31:19.819 --> 31:21.985
Maybe you should write it down.
You're clearer on the page.

31:22.072 --> 31:24.057
At first I thought my mom sent it.

31:24.145 --> 31:26.418
I mean, after all, she's the only one
who knew about the baby,

31:26.505 --> 31:28.028
and she can be vindictive.

31:28.166 --> 31:31.362
So I called and told her if she
tried something like that again,

31:31.450 --> 31:32.951
I'd cut her out of my life
completely.

31:34.088 --> 31:37.044
She panicked. She told me the truth.

31:37.520 --> 31:40.466
She didn't send the letter,
but she did tell you about the kid

31:40.553 --> 31:41.846
during one of your, uh...

31:43.431 --> 31:44.809
one of your trysts.

31:46.264 --> 31:48.622
Maybe she's confused.
She is getting up there in years.

31:48.747 --> 31:51.018
She also told me how you
forged her medical results

31:51.105 --> 31:52.489
to show she had cancer.

31:52.577 --> 31:53.995
Man, it would be such a shame

31:54.083 --> 31:56.231
to have your license
revoked for a second time.

31:56.319 --> 32:00.005
And Blake, he went to such
lengths to get it back for you.

32:00.529 --> 32:03.991
I guess there's no question as to
which child he should side with now.

32:33.391 --> 32:35.431
It's gonna be okay, right?

32:52.850 --> 32:55.669
- It's all going as planned.
- Are you sure this will work?

32:55.810 --> 32:58.709
Framing Adam for my murder?
They'll never see it coming.

32:58.797 --> 33:02.771
It's a big sacrifice.
Giving up your entire life here?

33:03.873 --> 33:06.997
It's what I've always wanted, Monny.
What we've always wanted.

33:07.264 --> 33:09.680
To make the Carringtons pay
for everything they've done to us.

33:09.767 --> 33:11.157
And it will work.

33:12.039 --> 33:15.782
You ungrateful son of a bitch.
My father did everything for you.

33:21.210 --> 33:24.712
Your threats mean nothing
to me, Adam. You're still fired.

33:30.495 --> 33:31.699
What are you doing here?

33:31.876 --> 33:34.298
I didn't want you to
have to do it alone.

33:34.417 --> 33:36.312
<i>And with a surprise assist
from Mom,</i>

33:36.641 --> 33:39.041
<i>we staged my disappearance.</i>

33:53.310 --> 33:55.411
<i>Once the police investigate,
they'll find evidence</i>

33:55.499 --> 33:58.177
<i>that Adam was involved
in my disappearance.</i>

33:58.816 --> 34:00.583
Thanks for calling 911.

34:00.945 --> 34:05.362
So, the only thing left to do
is for Jeff Colby to disappear.

34:05.592 --> 34:07.653
But not forever, right?

34:08.163 --> 34:10.918
As soon as Adam is behind bars,
we're coming to visit.

34:11.007 --> 34:14.145
That's right. It'll be
a family reunion in the Bahamas.

34:15.420 --> 34:16.731
Get over here.

34:24.417 --> 34:26.934
Take care of one another, all right?

34:40.367 --> 34:42.302
This better be worth it.

34:42.478 --> 34:44.302
I'll make sure of it.

34:58.408 --> 35:00.653
<i>I need to report a missing person.</i>

35:00.741 --> 35:03.740
<i>My son hasn't come home,
hasn't been responding to calls.</i>

35:03.828 --> 35:06.481
Something's wrong. I can feel it.

35:07.501 --> 35:09.013
Oh, God.

35:28.306 --> 35:30.471
Jeff won't be a problem anymore.

35:30.699 --> 35:32.216
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

35:32.304 --> 35:35.158
I assume the payments
will resume immediately?

35:35.246 --> 35:37.934
Well, of course, sis.
We share the same blood.

35:38.082 --> 35:39.788
That means we look out for one another.

35:39.875 --> 35:41.627
Related by blood, yes.

35:41.956 --> 35:44.130
But what you and I share

35:44.635 --> 35:48.599
is deception, jealousy and lies.

35:53.709 --> 35:55.762
You and I need to talk,
now.

35:55.850 --> 35:58.817
Make an appointment.
I have way bigger issues to deal with.

35:58.936 --> 35:59.808
That went well.

35:59.895 --> 36:01.612
Where's that backstabbing
father of ours?

36:01.699 --> 36:03.725
Let's turn that frown upside down.
You're just in time for a wedding.

36:03.812 --> 36:05.731
Don't gloat. I know
all about Blake's secret wedding.

36:05.818 --> 36:08.817
- You know about the charges being dropped?
- We'll see about that.

36:08.904 --> 36:10.195
I know he's trying to frame Culhane.

36:10.282 --> 36:12.404
Well, it wasn't all by himself.

36:12.491 --> 36:14.823
I mean, I played a small important role.

36:14.910 --> 36:16.909
Your ID badge was very helpful.

36:16.996 --> 36:18.494
And don't worry,

36:18.581 --> 36:21.134
I had your clothes
dry-cleaned after I wore them.

36:23.064 --> 36:25.183
Do you have any idea
what they're talking about?

36:25.271 --> 36:26.591
No, but we're gonna find out.

36:26.679 --> 36:28.648
Soon as my son arrives,
we can begin, Reverend.

36:28.736 --> 36:30.326
[Doyle Yes, of course.

36:30.605 --> 36:33.090
This is completely deranged,
even for you.

36:33.178 --> 36:35.719
Fallon, listen,
we decided not to invite any family

36:35.806 --> 36:37.054
because we wanted more of a private...

36:37.141 --> 36:39.264
Save it.
I want no part of this wedding.

36:39.351 --> 36:41.279
Blake time is over.

36:41.989 --> 36:45.287
- Would you excuse us, Reverend?
- Yes. Of course.

36:46.984 --> 36:48.607
- What's wrong with you?
- Where do I start?

36:48.694 --> 36:52.013
How about having a father that
pretends to break up with his fiancée

36:52.101 --> 36:53.794
just so they can frame
an innocent man?

36:53.882 --> 36:55.872
That's right, Sid and Nancy,
I figured it out.

36:55.960 --> 36:59.341
But Culhane got rid of the bag of money.
You won't get away with this.

36:59.997 --> 37:02.326
Wait? Did you say "bag" or "bags"?

37:02.666 --> 37:04.120
Yup, that's what I thought.

37:04.208 --> 37:06.206
So, when the FBI finds
the other bag of cash

37:06.294 --> 37:07.501
we planted in his apartment,

37:07.588 --> 37:08.936
they'll still think it came from Ada.

37:09.023 --> 37:10.660
Especially with the incriminating
evidence

37:10.747 --> 37:12.992
in his office
tying the cash back to her.

37:13.093 --> 37:15.458
It'll look like she paid
him to blackmail Blake,

37:15.546 --> 37:19.185
forcing our poor father
into extorting the senator.

37:19.475 --> 37:21.763
Oh, my God. Culhane.

37:24.188 --> 37:26.774
Michael Culhane,
we're placing you under arrest.

37:27.183 --> 37:30.021
And we have a warrant
to search your apartment.

37:30.720 --> 37:32.552
You have the right to remain silent.

37:32.640 --> 37:35.945
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

37:36.033 --> 37:38.407
And you.
You went along with this?

37:38.494 --> 37:40.513
Fallon, if you'll calm down,
we can explain everything.

37:40.600 --> 37:43.120
Don't tell me to calm down, lady.

37:43.207 --> 37:46.456
I thought you were a friend, but it
turns out you're as awful as he is.

37:46.543 --> 37:48.131
You two deserve each other.

37:48.258 --> 37:50.342
What you don't deserve is that hair.

37:52.220 --> 37:55.108
Hey! Can anyone hear me?

38:15.155 --> 38:16.987
- I think we got something.
- The ring?

38:17.074 --> 38:20.261
No. Definitely not the ring.

38:20.494 --> 38:22.328
Fallon, this is not
the time or place for this.

38:22.415 --> 38:23.908
You used me, your own daughter,

38:23.996 --> 38:26.656
just so Adam could get his foot
back in the door at the Atlantix

38:26.744 --> 38:29.055
and do your dirty work because
you knew I wouldn't frame Culhane.

38:29.142 --> 38:31.960
Culhane went to the FBI
and ratted out this family.

38:32.047 --> 38:33.796
He's getting exactly what he deserves.

38:33.883 --> 38:35.470
I'm trying to protect our dynasty.

38:35.558 --> 38:37.311
You don't have a dynasty to protect,

38:37.399 --> 38:39.551
because I'm selling all of my shares

38:39.638 --> 38:41.465
of the Atlantix team to Culhane.

38:41.682 --> 38:44.317
Don't be ridiculous, Fallon.
He'll be in federal prison.

38:44.405 --> 38:46.462
Not if I have anything to do with it.

38:52.685 --> 38:54.119
Fallon!

38:55.260 --> 38:59.228
So, this was your big plan, huh?
You cause me to lose the Atlantix,

38:59.369 --> 39:01.865
you sell Femperial,
and we both end up with nothing.

39:01.952 --> 39:04.076
No. I learned from you, Daddy.

39:04.163 --> 39:06.118
I sold Femperial, all right,

39:06.206 --> 39:08.439
to Kirby, for $1.

39:08.527 --> 39:12.031
And she's gonna sell it back to me,
so, actually I've lost nothing.

39:12.119 --> 39:14.869
- Actually, I'm not selling.
- What?

39:14.957 --> 39:17.380
- Wow.
- You wanna talk betrayal?

39:17.468 --> 39:19.883
You went behind my back
and told Culhane to dump me.

39:19.970 --> 39:22.426
Is that what you mean
by female empowerment?

39:22.514 --> 39:25.603
I'm keeping Femperial, and I'm
giving it the attention it deserves.

39:25.691 --> 39:27.068
We had a deal, Kirby.

39:27.156 --> 39:30.184
Wait a minute,
Blake screwed over Fallon and Culhane?

39:30.272 --> 39:32.062
It would appear that
loyalty's overrated.

39:32.149 --> 39:36.392
Anders, would you please tell
the Reverend that we are ready?

39:37.691 --> 39:39.517
I would, sir, but...

39:39.782 --> 39:43.009
and I'm sorry about
the timing... I'm out.

39:44.616 --> 39:46.322
Effective immediately.

39:47.495 --> 39:50.197
What? No. You can't quit now. I...

39:51.423 --> 39:53.501
Are those divers in the lake?
What are they doing?

39:53.589 --> 39:56.150
I hired them to find Fallon's ring.

39:57.320 --> 39:58.962
She dropped it in the water.

40:02.593 --> 40:05.361
Could you be any weirder?

40:12.142 --> 40:15.479
I swear. Enough of this fantasy.
From now on...

40:29.039 --> 40:31.371
Is that...? Is that a dead body?

40:31.458 --> 40:33.658
Mr. Carrington,
we need to call the police.

40:33.746 --> 40:35.494
What? Who is it?

40:35.644 --> 40:36.625
Male.

40:36.713 --> 40:39.258
By the looks of things,
he's been in there a few weeks.

40:39.662 --> 40:41.618
♪ <i>...get some shelter</i> ♪

40:41.775 --> 40:45.244
Walt! You're not gonna believe this,
but we got a second body.

40:45.352 --> 40:47.877
What? What are you...? This is insane.

40:48.360 --> 40:50.108
I had nothing to do with that one.

40:50.227 --> 40:51.900
♪ <i>It's just a shot away</i> ♪

40:51.988 --> 40:55.062
Not much to go by.
Probably been here for years.

40:55.257 --> 40:56.802
It's a young female.

40:56.890 --> 40:57.961
♪ <i>Children</i> ♪

40:58.049 --> 41:02.562
♪ <i>It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away</i> ♪

41:04.275 --> 41:06.110
Fallon never talked about it.

41:06.804 --> 41:09.658
I think that was one of the things
that really screwed me up, you know?

41:09.746 --> 41:13.265
You were so young to
witness something like that.

41:13.526 --> 41:15.625
I didn't see the accident itself.

41:17.457 --> 41:18.937
Just what he did.

41:20.215 --> 41:21.546
What who did?

41:22.154 --> 41:23.343
My father.

41:25.734 --> 41:32.136
♪ <i>War, children It's just a shot away</i> ♪

41:32.224 --> 41:34.211
Wow! Wonder who that could be.

41:34.299 --> 41:38.218
There's still a gold bracelet
around the wrist with a name on it.

41:38.480 --> 41:39.961
I think it says...

41:41.284 --> 41:44.963
♪ <i>I tell you love, sister</i> ♪

41:45.051 --> 41:46.195
- Trixie.

41:46.283 --> 41:50.257

41:50.345 --> 41:53.976

41:54.064 --> 41:58.888
