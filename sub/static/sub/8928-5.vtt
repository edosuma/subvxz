00:07.231 --> 00:09.668
You took one of me best
whores for your private use.

00:09.733 --> 00:12.331
Every day she's not under
my roof costs me money.

00:17.365 --> 00:18.961
Wait, listen to me!

00:20.329 --> 00:23.503
Good men will die for some hidden agenda,

00:23.568 --> 00:25.533
the Barlow woman's agenda.

00:25.598 --> 00:28.265
Things will get better here.
I promise you they will.

00:28.330 --> 00:29.801
We'll need some additional items.

00:29.866 --> 00:31.738
New guns, 12-pounders.

00:31.803 --> 00:33.338
You'll have it.

00:33.403 --> 00:36.103
You want the guns from my
ship to hand over to a pirate?

00:36.176 --> 00:37.269
That is correct.

00:37.342 --> 00:38.635
Help me, Mr. Scott.

00:38.708 --> 00:40.335
Please, help me save her.

00:40.400 --> 00:41.597
Why don't I take over?

00:43.331 --> 00:44.769
The Andromache, it can't be.

00:44.834 --> 00:46.464
Captain Bryson hasn't had time to unload.

00:46.537 --> 00:48.134
He didn't. She's riding low.

00:48.199 --> 00:49.668
Those guns are still on board.

00:49.733 --> 00:51.966
- What are we going to do?
- Get them back.

02:43.717 --> 02:45.148
Captain?

02:46.589 --> 02:49.186
We're steady at six
knots, north by northeast.

02:51.387 --> 02:53.197
You don't trust me, do you?

02:56.861 --> 02:59.529
With any luck, we'll
sight the Andromache soon.

03:01.129 --> 03:04.036
The battle will begin.

03:04.101 --> 03:07.646
You and I will have our roles to play.

03:09.649 --> 03:13.123
We have the chance for a
few minutes' honesty first.

03:15.292 --> 03:16.859
Honesty?

03:21.828 --> 03:23.532
Men died yesterday

03:23.597 --> 03:26.294
careening our ship faster than was safe.

03:26.359 --> 03:28.134
Men are going to die today

03:28.199 --> 03:29.902
attacking that merchant ship out there,

03:29.967 --> 03:33.470
and they'll die not knowing
it was all based on a lie.

03:33.535 --> 03:35.436
A lie?

03:35.501 --> 03:37.467
We don't even know if the
Urca's schedule is accurate.

03:37.540 --> 03:39.404
We're completely relying on the cook.

03:39.477 --> 03:42.306
How can you just pretend you
have no doubts about any of this?

03:42.371 --> 03:43.903
Years of practice.

03:45.271 --> 03:46.972
There's always doubt, Billy.

03:47.037 --> 03:48.444
No sane man would deny that.

03:48.509 --> 03:51.980
No good captain would acknowledge it.

03:52.046 --> 03:54.184
Take our present route, for instance.

03:54.249 --> 03:56.655
We tacked north by northeast,

03:56.720 --> 03:59.187
along Andromache's best point of sail.

03:59.252 --> 04:02.022
If you're Bryson, that's the smart course.

04:02.087 --> 04:03.255
Yeah...

04:03.328 --> 04:05.193
Well, he knows that I know that.

04:05.266 --> 04:07.927
So wouldn't he have at least
considered heading northwest

04:08.000 --> 04:11.501
to follow the coast, lose us in the dark?

04:11.566 --> 04:15.604
Or due east on the chance that
we might sail right past him?

04:15.669 --> 04:19.310
There must be at least one chance in three

04:19.375 --> 04:21.171
that that horizon will remain bare

04:21.244 --> 04:24.376
and we'll never see the Andromache again.

04:24.441 --> 04:27.440
That's the truth.

04:27.513 --> 04:29.711
But what good would that knowledge do

04:29.776 --> 04:34.242
for any man on this crew trying
to focus on doing his job?

04:36.043 --> 04:39.516
This crew needs certainty,

04:39.581 --> 04:41.789
and I need their support to achieve an end

04:41.854 --> 04:45.391
which is in all our best interests.

04:45.464 --> 04:47.360
So we dance the dance.

04:51.300 --> 04:55.370
Never was there a Caesar
that couldn't sing the tune.

04:55.443 --> 04:57.979
Who's Mrs. Barlow?

05:00.076 --> 05:02.083
Ah.

05:05.284 --> 05:07.850
You've heard the stories, haven't you?

05:07.923 --> 05:11.418
She's a witch who pledged
my soul to the devil,

05:11.491 --> 05:13.460
and anoints me with the blood of infants

05:13.525 --> 05:14.926
to keep me safe in battle.

05:14.999 --> 05:19.304
- Come on, I'm not stupid.
- No, you're not.

05:19.369 --> 05:23.106
So you can probably
guess it isn't as much fun

05:23.179 --> 05:25.609
to tell stories about how
your captain makes a home,

05:25.674 --> 05:28.882
with a nice Puritan woman
who shares his love of books.

05:32.418 --> 05:34.784
Is that the truth?

05:36.555 --> 05:37.787
Sails!

05:37.860 --> 05:39.660
Man your posts!

05:39.725 --> 05:41.693
Posts!

05:41.766 --> 05:43.262
Have a look.

05:43.335 --> 05:45.134
It's the Andromache!

06:06.855 --> 06:09.261
Well, this is a stupid fucking idea.

06:09.326 --> 06:12.264
Given the straits we're in, I would
suggest there is no such thing.

06:12.329 --> 06:14.537
If we don't find a way to
earn an income and soon,

06:14.602 --> 06:17.471
we will lose what little
we have left of a crew.

06:17.536 --> 06:19.365
Or worse yet, we will be eaten

06:19.438 --> 06:22.038
by what little we have left of a crew.

06:22.104 --> 06:24.272
Wish me luck.

06:24.345 --> 06:25.976
You gave him permission, dear.

06:26.041 --> 06:27.513
We must stand by our word.

06:27.578 --> 06:30.956
But I said he could put one
finger in my bum, not three.

06:31.021 --> 06:33.956
Then next time, charge him by the digit.

06:34.021 --> 06:36.289
Mrs. Mapleton, a word, please.

06:36.354 --> 06:38.290
What the fuck are you doing here?

06:38.363 --> 06:40.562
Mr. Noonan expressly
forbade it, did he not?

06:40.627 --> 06:44.099
It turns out Mr. Noonan
has had a change of heart.

06:48.438 --> 06:51.037
A transfer? What is this?

06:51.110 --> 06:52.970
It means, madam, that the dispute

06:53.043 --> 06:55.507
over the whore with Mr.
Noonan has been settled

06:55.580 --> 06:58.151
through an agreement to
purchase this establishment

06:58.216 --> 07:00.686
from him... by us.

07:00.751 --> 07:04.383
- Noonan sold you the inn?
- Yes, ma'am.

07:04.448 --> 07:06.086
And where is he now?

07:07.415 --> 07:09.791
From the tone in his voice,
it sounded as if Mr. Noonan

07:09.856 --> 07:11.687
couldn't wait to be rid of this place

07:11.760 --> 07:14.155
and of its screeching pig of a bawd.

07:15.219 --> 07:17.354
His words, not mine.

07:17.427 --> 07:19.826
The last I saw him, he was
seeking passage to Port Royal,

07:19.891 --> 07:21.698
and then to who knows where.

07:21.763 --> 07:24.232
You're telling me that Mr. Noonan,

07:24.297 --> 07:28.435
who just a few hours ago had the intent
of seeing your captain beaten to a pulp,

07:28.500 --> 07:32.674
that Mr. Noonan decided instead
to sell you his life's work?

07:32.739 --> 07:34.172
Yes.

07:34.245 --> 07:35.782
And you expect me to accept it

07:35.848 --> 07:38.119
based on a piece of paper and your word?

07:38.184 --> 07:39.847
And to keep my mouth shut about it

07:39.920 --> 07:43.257
when any half-wit can see
that there's foul play at hand?

07:43.322 --> 07:44.521
Yes.

07:45.892 --> 07:47.564
I want a raise.

07:47.629 --> 07:50.067
- What did you make before?
- Three percent of gross.

07:50.132 --> 07:51.931
I'll give you 40.

07:52.004 --> 07:54.636
Welcome aboard, sonny.

08:02.577 --> 08:04.741
We are the proud new owners of a brothel.

08:07.178 --> 08:09.353
Let's hope no one notices.

08:11.249 --> 08:13.887
No one has seen or heard
from Scott all morning.

08:13.952 --> 08:16.855
He must have left with Bryson.

08:16.920 --> 08:19.329
You're certain he said nothing
to you about why he would do this?

08:19.394 --> 08:21.100
Nothing, ma'am.

08:21.165 --> 08:23.131
- Before I knew what was happening...
- Get my horse ready.

08:23.196 --> 08:25.602
I'm going to see my father. I want
to know what the fuck's going on here.

08:34.610 --> 08:35.745
Hello.

08:35.811 --> 08:37.777
What the fuck are you doing in my office?

08:37.842 --> 08:39.881
Flint stashed me here.

08:39.947 --> 08:41.586
Presumably to stop what's in my head

08:41.650 --> 08:43.817
from spilling onto the
deck of the Andromache.

08:45.321 --> 08:48.089
Oh, that's Randall.

08:48.154 --> 08:50.227
Why is Randall lying on my sofa?

08:51.859 --> 08:53.995
Well, he's not exactly going
to be leading the charge

08:54.060 --> 08:55.627
after the day he had yesterday.

08:55.700 --> 08:58.101
Why are you chained to him?

08:58.166 --> 08:59.940
So I don't try to run.

09:01.437 --> 09:02.877
Thank you.

09:08.310 --> 09:12.280
Sorry, have I done something to you?

09:12.345 --> 09:13.847
Excuse me?

09:13.912 --> 09:16.416
Well, you seem to harbor quite
a bit of anger towards me,

09:16.481 --> 09:18.486
and considering we hardly
even know each other,

09:18.551 --> 09:20.250
I'm wondering if there's
something I'm missing.

09:20.315 --> 09:23.145
Flint and his crew offer you a
life of freedom and prosperity

09:23.218 --> 09:25.319
for which you repay them
by stealing the product

09:25.384 --> 09:26.982
of months of their labor and sacrifice.

09:27.047 --> 09:29.319
But you're not finished. Then you
lure Max into your selfish scheme.

09:29.384 --> 09:30.591
Hold on.

09:30.656 --> 09:32.658
I specifically tried to talk her out

09:32.723 --> 09:34.761
of getting wrapped up in my selfish scheme.

09:34.825 --> 09:38.263
I know all I need to know
about the kind of man you are.

09:38.328 --> 09:42.027
Ma'am, you should come outside right away.

09:43.596 --> 09:45.935
For years, we've all
profited in this place,

09:46.000 --> 09:49.304
trading on the stability
of my family's name.

09:49.377 --> 09:52.976
But unfortunately, our
circumstances have changed.

09:53.049 --> 09:57.648
A fortnight ago, His Majesty's Navy
attempted to place me under arrest.

09:59.489 --> 10:02.289
I am, since that day, a fugitive

10:02.354 --> 10:04.828
marked for execution by the Crown.

10:06.566 --> 10:09.229
Unbeknownst to me, my family in Boston

10:09.302 --> 10:12.499
learned of this and ordered Captain Bryson

10:12.564 --> 10:14.401
to liquidate our holdings here.

10:14.467 --> 10:16.066
What about our goods?

10:16.139 --> 10:19.609
I convinced him to leave behind
the contents of our warehouse,

10:19.674 --> 10:21.944
but that is all.

10:22.009 --> 10:23.576
To those of you owed credit

10:23.641 --> 10:26.511
or for whom we held goods on consignment,

10:26.576 --> 10:31.380
I leave it to my daughter to see
you made whole as best we can.

10:31.445 --> 10:34.411
But once that is settled,
our business with you

10:34.484 --> 10:36.148
must be considered complete.

10:37.717 --> 10:40.986
I'm very sorry. Godspeed to you all.

10:41.051 --> 10:43.491
I want my money back!

10:55.433 --> 10:58.070
We aren't closing on her!

11:02.304 --> 11:04.375
I said to raise all the canvas!

11:04.440 --> 11:08.205
- What's our speed?
- Sails are all raised!

11:08.278 --> 11:09.741
No, they're not.

11:09.813 --> 11:12.013
Where are my t'gallants
on the main and mizzen?

11:12.078 --> 11:13.550
Captain, we're fully loaded.

11:13.615 --> 11:15.783
If we raise the t'gallants,
the mast won't hold.

11:15.857 --> 11:18.352
Stand by to stretch that starboard!

11:26.065 --> 11:27.768
Time.

11:30.504 --> 11:33.367
Present speed: six knots.

11:33.440 --> 11:36.301
We need at least another knot
if we're to catch up by dark.

11:42.215 --> 11:44.276
- Raise the t'gallants.
- Captain...

11:44.349 --> 11:46.545
Shift aft the back stays if
you're worried about the masts.

11:46.610 --> 11:48.249
Shift 'em to the stern if you have to.

11:48.314 --> 11:50.016
Even if the back stays
hold at such an angle,

11:50.081 --> 11:51.981
and I wager they won't,
the load on the sails

11:52.046 --> 11:54.044
will exceed capacity and
she'll dig in hard at the bow.

11:54.117 --> 11:55.283
She'll hold.

11:55.348 --> 11:57.651
Hard enough to shake
loose the rigging entirely.

11:57.716 --> 12:02.192
Captain, Mr. De Groot makes a good point.

12:02.257 --> 12:04.760
The speed we'll pick up will
come with dire risks for the ship.

12:07.031 --> 12:10.230
But I think she can take it.

12:13.737 --> 12:17.101
Mr. De Groot, quickly, please.

12:17.174 --> 12:20.137
- Raise the t'gallants!
- Raise the t'gallants!

12:24.411 --> 12:26.949
Out of the way!

12:27.014 --> 12:30.086
Brace up another five degrees!

12:30.151 --> 12:33.053
- Five degrees!
- Five degrees!

12:38.023 --> 12:39.430
Bring her up into it.

12:54.481 --> 12:56.376
More!

12:57.786 --> 13:00.386
Brace up a little more!

13:00.451 --> 13:01.555
More!

13:04.461 --> 13:05.693
That's well!

13:05.758 --> 13:07.863
- That's well.
- Hold on!

13:20.050 --> 13:21.913
Now bring her up into it.

13:25.417 --> 13:28.258
More, damn it.

13:30.353 --> 13:31.761
Like this!

13:44.474 --> 13:46.041
Aye, Captain!

13:47.107 --> 13:48.674
There.

13:48.747 --> 13:50.409
Hold it there. Hold her tight.

13:54.182 --> 13:56.717
Speed! Again, please!

13:56.790 --> 13:58.925
Time!

14:00.989 --> 14:03.323
Seven and a half knots!

14:12.363 --> 14:15.834
All right, ladies, get some rest.

14:15.906 --> 14:19.504
In a few hours, things are
gonna get awfully interesting.

14:34.749 --> 14:36.652
Good morning, dear.

14:39.389 --> 14:41.492
"Orders from Boston,

14:41.557 --> 14:44.827
unbeknownst to me."

14:44.893 --> 14:47.259
You sent Bryson away.

14:47.332 --> 14:48.500
Yes.

14:48.565 --> 14:51.269
You lied to my face, you shit.

14:51.334 --> 14:54.204
And what choice did you leave me?

14:54.269 --> 14:57.006
You let Flint seduce you

14:57.071 --> 14:59.913
into his madness about the Spanish galleon

14:59.978 --> 15:02.282
all in furtherance of the fantasy

15:02.347 --> 15:04.587
that you can resist English rule,

15:04.652 --> 15:09.091
that your authority in this place
is yours to do with as you please.

15:09.156 --> 15:11.693
I am more to this place than you ever were.

15:11.765 --> 15:13.028
You are a child.

15:14.461 --> 15:17.068
I'm fully aware that Captain Flint

15:17.133 --> 15:20.503
left in pursuit of the
Andromache last night.

15:20.576 --> 15:22.007
But you should know

15:22.072 --> 15:24.206
Captain Bryson sailed the Velasco route

15:24.279 --> 15:26.308
for 10 years and was never boarded.

15:26.373 --> 15:27.812
Not once.

15:29.948 --> 15:33.456
Flint will be returning either
empty-handed or not at all.

15:33.521 --> 15:35.890
This treasure galleon business is over.

15:35.963 --> 15:38.226
As for our future here,

15:38.291 --> 15:40.699
I am working on a deal
that'll make a safe place

15:40.764 --> 15:42.734
for us among the farmers in the interior.

15:42.807 --> 15:44.672
When the pirates are gone,

15:44.737 --> 15:47.008
the landowners will drive commerce here.

15:47.073 --> 15:49.608
They'll be indispensable to
the lords and to Whitehall,

15:49.681 --> 15:52.146
and so we will make allies of them.

15:52.219 --> 15:55.588
We will adapt and we will survive.

15:55.653 --> 15:59.624
I won't ask you to walk
out with me right now.

15:59.689 --> 16:01.688
I know your pride would never permit it.

16:03.257 --> 16:05.330
The Barlow cunt who was
supposed to watch over you,

16:05.395 --> 16:08.100
that's Flint's problem.

16:08.165 --> 16:10.602
But Scott...

16:10.667 --> 16:12.506
what the fuck did you
have to threaten him with

16:12.571 --> 16:14.075
to get him to betray me?

16:16.845 --> 16:19.782
We talked like men and he saw reason.

16:21.017 --> 16:23.017
Fuck you.

16:32.495 --> 16:36.367
I been sayin' it. You ain't been listening.

16:36.432 --> 16:37.799
And now it's come to pass.

16:37.864 --> 16:40.070
The day that gentleman and his daughter

16:40.135 --> 16:42.070
tell you that the money they took

16:42.135 --> 16:44.070
ain't never coming back.

16:46.073 --> 16:48.649
Yeah, that were just fucking theft!

16:49.850 --> 16:51.480
Right now, that little girl

16:51.545 --> 16:53.615
is sitting in there counting your money

16:53.680 --> 16:55.654
and laughing her scrawny ass off

16:55.719 --> 16:58.656
on how much she has
lifted out of your pockets.

16:58.721 --> 17:00.190
This is fucking nuts!

17:00.255 --> 17:03.621
- We're not working!
- Good riddance, yeah!

17:09.998 --> 17:12.637
I thought my men could help
keep tempers from boiling over,

17:12.702 --> 17:14.468
for a while at least.

17:14.532 --> 17:17.144
But for those owed money out there,

17:17.209 --> 17:19.410
it's only a matter of
time before their tempers

17:19.483 --> 17:21.549
can no longer be held in check.

17:21.614 --> 17:25.685
Now, if I may, I suggest an
announcement of payments to settle debts.

17:25.759 --> 17:27.191
The longer it takes them to hear it,

17:27.256 --> 17:29.161
the more fuel Lilywhite
can throw on the fire.

17:29.226 --> 17:30.832
I can't pay them all.

17:32.097 --> 17:34.264
You're short?

17:34.337 --> 17:36.337
How short?

17:36.402 --> 17:39.569
Well, get out your books, then.

17:39.642 --> 17:42.609
Certain crews may defer
their debts if I ask them.

17:42.674 --> 17:46.376
Any leads you have on future
scores would soften the blow.

17:46.449 --> 17:48.479
Troublemakers we need to pay off first...

17:48.544 --> 17:49.615
No.

17:51.150 --> 17:53.045
I'm not winding things up here.

17:53.118 --> 17:54.886
My business continues.

17:56.551 --> 18:00.295
Captain Naft of the Intrepid.
Mr. Walker, her quartermaster.

18:00.360 --> 18:03.261
Captain Lawrence of the
Black Hind and Mr. Harrison.

18:03.326 --> 18:06.032
And our friend Mr. Frasier.
Get them all here now.

18:07.299 --> 18:08.435
Miss Guthrie?

18:10.437 --> 18:13.142
I'm not sure you recognize
the gravity of this situation.

18:13.215 --> 18:17.118
Have a drink. Relax.

18:17.183 --> 18:19.120
Everything's under control.

18:23.259 --> 18:24.530
She's fucking done!

18:24.595 --> 18:27.130
That Guthrie cunt is done.

18:30.161 --> 18:32.231
Have you not heard?

18:32.296 --> 18:34.029
We've heard.

18:34.102 --> 18:36.300
Well, then what the fuck
are we doing in here?

18:36.365 --> 18:38.067
At the moment, I'm
remembering what it feels like

18:38.132 --> 18:39.435
to have food in my belly.

18:39.500 --> 18:42.002
- Care to join us?
- Jesus, Jack.

18:42.067 --> 18:45.005
We're free of her. Free to hunt again.

18:45.078 --> 18:47.742
So get off your ass and find us a ship.

18:47.815 --> 18:50.549
To assume that we've seen
the last of Eleanor Guthrie

18:50.614 --> 18:52.917
is, well, not to know her.

18:52.982 --> 18:55.988
The fact that she appears to have Captain
Hornigold and his men propping her up

18:56.053 --> 18:57.419
only adds to my conviction.

18:57.484 --> 19:00.259
Right now, we'd do well
to keep our mouths shut,

19:00.324 --> 19:02.692
be thankful we have some
income from this place,

19:02.757 --> 19:04.922
for the moment, and bide our time.

19:04.995 --> 19:06.258
Fuck that.

19:06.331 --> 19:09.127
She's got no ships. She's got no business.

19:09.192 --> 19:10.862
That means she's out.

19:10.927 --> 19:15.199
And I'm going over there
to make sure she knows it.

19:15.264 --> 19:16.766
Captain?

19:21.102 --> 19:23.205
I'll be upstairs.

19:28.417 --> 19:30.921
Well, then, fuck you both.

19:30.986 --> 19:32.784
Who's with me?

19:35.453 --> 19:37.883
Nothing can ever be simple.

19:37.955 --> 19:40.984
I can make it simple.

19:41.056 --> 19:44.552
Darling, this is a lovely stopgap,

19:44.625 --> 19:46.995
but if we are to ever hunt
as a proper crew again,

19:47.061 --> 19:50.267
we will need, well, a crew.

19:50.332 --> 19:52.999
Right now, those men are all we have.

19:53.065 --> 19:54.432
It's unfortunate, perhaps,

19:54.497 --> 19:55.904
but no less a reality.

19:58.842 --> 20:01.073
Why don't we take advantage of
Mr. Hamund's momentary distraction

20:01.138 --> 20:03.073
and have Mrs. Mapleton tend
to the whore on the beach?

20:18.587 --> 20:21.046
- Two six!
- Heave!

20:21.119 --> 20:22.782
- Two six!
- Heave!

20:22.855 --> 20:24.517
- Two six!
- Heave!

20:24.582 --> 20:27.925
Stand by! Stand by!

20:50.222 --> 20:52.485
Ahem.

20:52.557 --> 20:54.420
Yes, Mr. Hayes?

20:54.493 --> 20:56.523
The Walrus will be upon
us in roughly four hours,

20:56.588 --> 20:58.027
present speed.

20:58.092 --> 20:59.996
I assume preparations have been made.

21:00.061 --> 21:01.700
Yes, sir.

21:01.765 --> 21:03.734
And the shipment of china plate?

21:04.935 --> 21:06.533
I beg your pardon?

21:06.606 --> 21:09.839
We have 70 plates of Chinese
porcelain in the hold,

21:09.913 --> 21:13.376
which I have undertaken to
deliver to Boston unharmed.

21:15.544 --> 21:18.643
May I suggest more straw in the chest?

21:19.714 --> 21:20.880
Yes, sir.

21:24.017 --> 21:25.918
He's certain this is all we have?

21:25.983 --> 21:27.782
We emptied the girl before we careened her.

21:27.847 --> 21:29.983
This is the best I could
do before we set sail.

21:30.056 --> 21:31.719
Same for food and water, I assume?

21:31.792 --> 21:35.124
Food, water, powder, all of it.

21:35.189 --> 21:37.557
Right. Take it all up top.

21:37.622 --> 21:39.128
No reserves on this one.

21:39.201 --> 21:42.233
Either we take Bryson's ship or we're...

21:42.298 --> 21:45.674
I believe the word you're
looking for is "fucked."

21:45.739 --> 21:48.010
- Yeah, thank you.
- Yeah.

21:50.105 --> 21:51.672
Dufresne?

21:54.178 --> 21:55.713
You can't be serious.

21:57.816 --> 22:00.014
Andromache's manned like a warship.

22:00.087 --> 22:02.823
60 men at least, and they're fighters.

22:02.889 --> 22:05.422
So we'll need every body we can
muster on this one, yours included.

22:05.487 --> 22:06.988
Come on.

22:24.636 --> 22:27.138
Come on, everything's at sixes and sevens

22:27.203 --> 22:28.874
back at the house

22:28.939 --> 22:30.747
and I have to come and tend to this.

22:34.412 --> 22:36.150
All right. Come on, love.

22:36.223 --> 22:38.152
Here we go.

22:39.889 --> 22:41.592
Open your legs.

22:44.462 --> 22:46.827
Oh, hush, unless you want to find yourself

22:46.890 --> 22:49.899
carrying one of those fools' brats.

22:57.006 --> 22:58.975
Ow!

22:59.040 --> 23:00.709
Get out.

23:12.317 --> 23:14.723
She wasn't using enough lotion.

23:33.235 --> 23:35.436
You could've left.

23:38.141 --> 23:41.244
When that cunt beat Hamund
off of you, you could've left.

23:41.309 --> 23:43.044
You didn't.

23:44.948 --> 23:47.482
Thought you could
sweet-talk them all, did ya?

23:47.547 --> 23:50.316
What do you care?

23:50.382 --> 23:52.554
Once, one of them came and put his balls

23:52.620 --> 23:55.290
on my shoulder whilst I was asleep.

23:55.355 --> 23:57.753
Thought it was funny.

23:57.826 --> 24:00.322
Last time he put them anywhere.

24:06.725 --> 24:10.293
If you take it, they'll give it.

24:12.168 --> 24:14.242
Why do you say these things?

24:15.939 --> 24:19.010
You were the one who threw
me to them in the first place.

24:21.282 --> 24:23.481
I only thought they'd kill you.

24:32.288 --> 24:35.592
Do you feel that soreness
between your haunches?

24:35.657 --> 24:37.328
Yeah, well, that's what you get

24:37.393 --> 24:39.957
when you let some cunt
who's never raised a sail,

24:40.030 --> 24:42.629
set foot on a deck tell you your business!

24:43.967 --> 24:45.430
Next thing you know,

24:45.502 --> 24:46.964
she'll have her boot on your throat

24:47.036 --> 24:49.236
and her hand in your fucking pocket.

24:49.301 --> 24:51.542
I think he's talking about you.

24:51.607 --> 24:54.142
That's what you get when you're
letting a wench tell you...

24:54.207 --> 24:56.174
If you're pretending to remain unconcerned

24:56.247 --> 24:58.512
for my peace of mind, please don't.

24:58.585 --> 25:00.721
It amuses me that you think
I would even give a shit

25:00.786 --> 25:03.417
- about your peace of mind.
- Of course.

25:03.490 --> 25:06.992
Still, I don't think you're giving that
problem out there its due attention.

25:08.329 --> 25:10.456
Naft and Walker just
arrived. That's everyone.

25:14.897 --> 25:17.401
You've never seen a mob turn, have you?

25:17.466 --> 25:19.075
Funny thing.

25:19.140 --> 25:21.508
The people most surprised when it happens,

25:21.573 --> 25:23.947
usually the ones that gave
rise to it in the first place.

25:27.011 --> 25:29.111
Can you join me, please, Captain?
I want you to hear this, too.

25:29.176 --> 25:31.111
Is the cunt still here?

25:31.184 --> 25:33.449
- Out on the street, friend.
- Where is she?

25:39.356 --> 25:41.490
It's a rough world out there, isn't it?

25:44.760 --> 25:47.360
Someone opens their mouth,

25:47.433 --> 25:49.095
you can lose everything.

25:52.470 --> 25:55.069
Tell me, lass...

25:55.135 --> 25:56.638
how's it feel?

25:58.176 --> 26:00.510
Out now.

26:02.446 --> 26:04.508
Well, if we're not welcome in here,

26:04.581 --> 26:06.675
I suppose we can go spend more time

26:06.747 --> 26:08.681
with our friend on the beach.

26:10.284 --> 26:13.789
Oh, wonderful lass she is.

26:14.958 --> 26:16.821
So, um...

26:16.893 --> 26:18.356
resilient.

26:20.861 --> 26:24.167
So appreciative of what she's given.

26:26.442 --> 26:28.738
We'll send her your love.

26:35.144 --> 26:37.613
Come on, boys.

26:48.057 --> 26:49.558
Gentlemen...

26:51.724 --> 26:54.164
I think we all know what
we're up against today,

26:54.230 --> 26:55.765
so let's just get to it.

26:57.098 --> 27:00.095
As we close the distance to the Andromache,

27:00.160 --> 27:04.367
the captain believes
Bryson will attack port

27:04.432 --> 27:07.239
and set himself for a
clean broadside volley.

27:07.304 --> 27:09.702
He'll loose his guns, pay off downwind,

27:09.775 --> 27:10.871
and continue running.

27:10.935 --> 27:12.406
Now, ordinarily,

27:12.471 --> 27:14.678
we would either match him and return fire

27:14.743 --> 27:17.915
or slip into his wake and
make a run at his stern.

27:17.988 --> 27:20.618
Unfortunately, we're too
outgunned for the former,

27:20.683 --> 27:22.889
and Bryson is too skilled
a captain for the latter.

27:22.954 --> 27:24.457
He'll just keep shooting and delaying

27:24.522 --> 27:26.193
and shooting and delaying until nightfall,

27:26.258 --> 27:28.161
at which point he'll just slip away.

27:28.226 --> 27:29.329
So...

27:29.394 --> 27:31.895
So, if we can't shoot at her

27:31.960 --> 27:33.429
and we can't get close to her,

27:33.494 --> 27:34.860
how the hell do we board her?

27:38.303 --> 27:41.269
We go straight at her.

27:41.334 --> 27:43.732
Without the bow chasers, we'll
be sitting ducks for her guns.

27:43.805 --> 27:45.434
She'll rake us bow to stern.

27:45.507 --> 27:48.203
Not to mention we'd be
boarding bow to midship.

27:48.276 --> 27:49.875
For all you virgins in the room,

27:49.940 --> 27:51.843
that's also known as fucking suicide.

27:51.909 --> 27:54.716
Of course we'd need to board alongside her.

27:54.781 --> 27:57.978
We just need Captain Bryson to cooperate

27:58.051 --> 28:01.157
and bring the Andromache
about for us to do so.

28:01.223 --> 28:04.023
And how the hell do we get him to do that?

28:04.096 --> 28:07.158
Mr. Beauclerc is going to convince him.

28:25.749 --> 28:27.412
You're a natural, son.

28:27.485 --> 28:29.716
When this is all over, I'll
be lucky to still have a job.

28:32.700 --> 28:35.079
- What...
- I keep accounts.

28:35.152 --> 28:36.717
That's what I'm good at.

28:38.518 --> 28:40.147
Do you see this number here?

28:40.220 --> 28:43.045
That's how much I've saved
this crew this last year alone.

28:43.118 --> 28:44.813
Can you say of any other man here

28:44.886 --> 28:46.421
that they've earned as much?

28:46.486 --> 28:49.387
Every man on this crew had a first time.

28:49.452 --> 28:50.785
You're overdue.

28:50.850 --> 28:52.656
But I've never even shot a pistol.

28:52.721 --> 28:54.586
Well, that's all right.

28:54.658 --> 28:57.190
Half the time they don't even fire.

29:03.289 --> 29:04.889
I'm sorry.

29:08.427 --> 29:11.834
Time has come for us to tell those who aim

29:11.899 --> 29:14.171
to make us slaves.

29:14.236 --> 29:16.675
Mr. Rackham asked me to tend to you.

29:18.275 --> 29:20.507
Yeah, well, that's what you get.

29:24.715 --> 29:27.284
He said I wasn't to take no for an answer.

29:33.488 --> 29:36.057
They're saying she may be finished.

29:36.122 --> 29:37.489
She's finally got her due.

29:41.499 --> 29:43.267
All I meant is that...

29:43.332 --> 29:46.772
that it should please
you after what she did.

29:46.837 --> 29:51.343
You hate her. I hate her.

29:51.408 --> 29:53.143
They all hate her.

29:54.847 --> 29:57.181
Look what's good it's done us.

29:59.854 --> 30:02.990
No captain on this island's
ever known that kind of power.

30:03.055 --> 30:06.527
Power that doesn't care how
many votes you can tally,

30:06.592 --> 30:09.463
who loves you, who hates you,

30:09.528 --> 30:12.463
who fears you.

30:12.536 --> 30:14.737
Power that just is.

30:14.802 --> 30:16.903
Truth is,

30:16.968 --> 30:20.271
none of us have any
right to hate her for it.

30:20.344 --> 30:25.446
She's strong and we're weak.

30:25.511 --> 30:27.447
That's the reality of things here.

30:30.847 --> 30:35.025
And no one down there is strong
enough to change anything.

30:36.459 --> 30:37.890
Not you?

30:45.666 --> 30:47.234
You're not strong enough?

30:47.307 --> 30:49.077
I don't know.

30:50.480 --> 30:52.740
But I think it's time I probably found out.

31:12.692 --> 31:14.289
What if he's wrong?

31:14.354 --> 31:16.956
There's a chance Bryson just
keeps running, isn't there?

31:18.886 --> 31:21.125
- That's it, steady.
- Right?

31:22.990 --> 31:24.724
Bryson could still gain speed.

31:24.797 --> 31:26.027
I mean, there has to be a chance

31:26.092 --> 31:28.027
this fight will never materialize.

31:28.100 --> 31:29.933
Come on.

31:29.998 --> 31:32.502
Come on, you bitch.

31:32.575 --> 31:34.470
Come on.

31:42.978 --> 31:45.081
There she goes!

31:50.847 --> 31:52.812
Why isn't he attacking?

31:52.884 --> 31:56.286
Because he knows he'll
never board us if he does.

31:56.351 --> 31:59.090
I will say this for him. He's no coward.

32:00.932 --> 32:02.900
200 yards, you may fire at will.

32:15.982 --> 32:17.980
I don't think I can do this.

32:18.045 --> 32:19.347
Yes, you can.

32:21.850 --> 32:24.217
Listen. Listen to me.

32:24.282 --> 32:26.290
You will make it through this.

32:26.355 --> 32:29.092
No one eats it their
first time over the side.

32:29.157 --> 32:31.230
I'm telling you, it's never
happened. Not on this crew.

32:31.295 --> 32:33.368
Don't ask me why, it just is.

32:33.433 --> 32:35.201
Men die all the time. It can't be true.

32:35.274 --> 32:37.569
No, not first-timers.

32:37.642 --> 32:39.505
Name one.

32:41.674 --> 32:43.208
You're gonna be all right.

32:45.048 --> 32:46.480
Come on.

32:46.545 --> 32:48.113
Damn it.

32:53.184 --> 32:54.623
I hope you know what you're doing.

32:54.688 --> 32:56.318
So do I.

32:59.929 --> 33:03.000
Mr. Beauclerc? Range?

33:04.800 --> 33:06.462
Almost there!

33:06.535 --> 33:08.271
50 more yards, Captain!

33:16.834 --> 33:18.272
Fire!

33:18.337 --> 33:20.038
- Let her go.
- Fire!

33:20.104 --> 33:23.240
Incoming!

33:23.313 --> 33:24.544
Fire!

33:31.521 --> 33:33.657
Get 'em back into the cookroom!

33:33.722 --> 33:35.996
Get 'em back!

33:36.061 --> 33:38.230
We can't take much more of this.

33:38.295 --> 33:41.070
Aye. Mr. Beauclerc!

33:48.839 --> 33:50.044
- Two six!
- Heave!

33:50.109 --> 33:51.412
- Two six!
- Heave!

33:51.477 --> 33:53.612
Hayes, another volley right away!

33:53.677 --> 33:55.380
Right cannon round!

33:55.445 --> 33:58.116
Mr. Burnett, prepare to bear
away and bring us into the wind.

34:00.117 --> 34:01.787
Man the braces!

34:01.852 --> 34:03.586
Fire!

34:08.322 --> 34:13.159
Beauclerc, do it!

34:23.170 --> 34:24.568
Stay where you are!

34:24.641 --> 34:27.034
Bring us to starboard
before we lose the wind!

34:36.375 --> 34:38.846
- Mr. Harris, take the helm!
- Aye, sir!

34:44.012 --> 34:45.146
Fire.

34:58.197 --> 34:59.859
We've lost the wind, Captain.

35:04.795 --> 35:06.867
Prepare to repel boarders!

35:10.510 --> 35:12.875
Bring us around to the port side!

35:12.940 --> 35:15.139
On the rails!

36:12.149 --> 36:13.747
Now!

36:15.821 --> 36:17.693
20 yards! At the ready.

36:17.759 --> 36:21.201
Get across the gap, choose your targets!

36:21.266 --> 36:23.568
Pistols at zero range.

36:23.633 --> 36:26.201
Don't waste a shot.

36:26.275 --> 36:27.404
Nets in!

36:31.507 --> 36:33.442
Nets up, nets up, nets up!

36:34.844 --> 36:37.250
Get it!

36:37.315 --> 36:40.018
10 yards! Go, go, go!

36:40.083 --> 36:41.689
Over! Get it over!

36:41.754 --> 36:44.215
Hold, get down! Hold, hold!

36:44.288 --> 36:46.252
Hold!

37:00.864 --> 37:02.466
Go, go, go!

38:49.517 --> 38:50.716
Dufresne?

38:55.691 --> 38:57.689
Jesus.

38:59.594 --> 39:02.130
Come on.

39:04.436 --> 39:05.971
No fucking longer!

39:08.772 --> 39:13.078
Gentlemen, you all heard
my father this morning,

39:13.143 --> 39:16.111
that the Guthrie trading
operation here in Nassau is dead.

39:17.246 --> 39:19.411
To that, I just have this to add...

39:19.484 --> 39:21.884
fuck him and fuck that.

39:23.822 --> 39:27.323
Mr. Frasier, you hold a charter from the
Massachusetts Bay Provincial Authority

39:27.388 --> 39:29.629
to ship rare items abroad, is that correct?

39:29.694 --> 39:31.896
That's correct, yes.

39:31.969 --> 39:34.334
And, theoretically, that
charter should pass muster

39:34.399 --> 39:36.467
at any customshouse in the colonies, yes?

39:36.532 --> 39:40.168
Well, I suppose so, but...

39:40.234 --> 39:43.369
Gentlemen, by my count,

39:43.434 --> 39:45.274
the Black Hind and the Intrepid

39:45.339 --> 39:47.947
have accumulated prizes
totaling approximately

39:48.013 --> 39:51.285
1,600 pieces of eight since the new year.

39:51.350 --> 39:55.188
That's gross. That's both ships.

39:55.253 --> 39:57.358
That barely exceeds your
operating costs over the same time.

39:57.423 --> 39:59.023
If you brought us here to insult us...

39:59.096 --> 40:01.062
It's not an insult, it's a fact.

40:01.127 --> 40:03.892
You command the two least
profitable ships on the island

40:03.965 --> 40:05.659
as a function of basic arithmetic.

40:07.300 --> 40:10.232
But they are ships, and large ones at that.

40:10.297 --> 40:13.296
At this table, we have a legitimate front.

40:13.369 --> 40:16.838
We have ships and crews
that can ferry heavy cargo.

40:16.903 --> 40:19.604
We have relationships with
the merchants and customs men

40:19.669 --> 40:21.372
that kept my father's trade moving.

40:21.437 --> 40:23.204
Your father said he'll take
no part in any further...

40:23.269 --> 40:25.403
They're my relationships now.

40:28.504 --> 40:32.008
We're going to recreate
my father's system here...

40:32.082 --> 40:34.680
without my father.

40:34.745 --> 40:37.681
A consortium, with all of
you sharing in the profits.

40:41.323 --> 40:43.994
- You're mad.
- How so?

40:44.060 --> 40:46.261
My men aren't merchant sailors.

40:46.333 --> 40:47.462
They're hunters.

40:47.535 --> 40:50.237
Yes, but they're bad at it, Geoffrey.

40:50.302 --> 40:51.566
What good is that doing anyone?

40:51.639 --> 40:53.375
I put this to them, they'll vote me out

40:53.440 --> 40:54.776
before I stop to take a breath.

40:54.841 --> 40:56.714
I'm amazed they haven't
voted you out already,

40:56.779 --> 40:59.281
given the shit prizes you've been chasing.

40:59.346 --> 41:01.984
Your men will earn three times
as much in half the time...

41:02.049 --> 41:05.720
Not facing a single sword
or pistol in the process.

41:05.785 --> 41:07.489
You're telling me that you can't sell that?

41:07.554 --> 41:09.455
I can sell that.

41:15.729 --> 41:17.328
And you're supporting this?

41:21.403 --> 41:23.474
I don't know. Am I?

41:23.539 --> 41:24.843
None of this matters

41:24.908 --> 41:27.179
unless we can get people
to agree to sell through us.

41:27.245 --> 41:30.720
We need a respected captain
to stand up and bless it.

41:30.785 --> 41:34.514
And we need a strong captain to
ensure that no one dares fuck with us.

41:34.587 --> 41:35.985
You're both.

41:38.121 --> 41:39.858
You know that I want nothing more

41:39.924 --> 41:42.964
than to make this place strong and stable.

41:43.029 --> 41:46.532
I think you want the same things.

41:46.597 --> 41:48.966
Bless this endeavor and we can have them.

41:50.777 --> 41:51.936
I'll do that...

41:53.947 --> 41:56.178
the moment you lift
the ban on Captain Vane.

41:57.420 --> 42:00.116
- Excuse me?
- Listen to that mob outside.

42:00.189 --> 42:02.556
They're tired of your
edicts, your rule by fear.

42:02.621 --> 42:05.629
They believe you to be
a tyrant in a petticoat.

42:05.694 --> 42:09.197
Your action against Captain Vane
is, to them, the most egregious case.

42:09.262 --> 42:10.398
You want me to lift the ban on Charles Vane

42:10.464 --> 42:12.368
to appease a handful of
malcontents on the street?

42:12.433 --> 42:14.705
Those malcontents will be a
problem to anyone in this room

42:14.770 --> 42:16.705
who stands behind you today.

42:16.778 --> 42:19.115
Provocation, even sabotage.

42:19.180 --> 42:21.251
And then you'll ask my men to assume

42:21.317 --> 42:23.550
the responsibility of
defending all of you from it.

42:23.623 --> 42:26.159
Charles Vane is an animal, as
are the men that remain with him.

42:26.224 --> 42:28.095
Because they saw fit to
punish a thieving whore.

42:28.161 --> 42:30.391
I'm not about to say otherwise for
the benefit of Captain Lilywhite

42:30.464 --> 42:32.262
or any of the other idiots
out there listening to him.

42:32.327 --> 42:34.231
I'm listening to him.

42:37.472 --> 42:40.071
Your commitment to this place is admirable,

42:40.137 --> 42:43.441
but you're young and you're rash.

42:43.514 --> 42:46.010
Show everyone your motive
here is for the common good.

42:46.083 --> 42:48.251
Show them that you can be trusted

42:48.316 --> 42:51.526
to keep petty animosity
separate from business.

42:51.591 --> 42:55.461
Rescind the ban on Captain
Vane and show me that.

42:55.526 --> 42:58.260
Do it and I'll back you as
your father's successor here,

42:58.326 --> 43:00.702
the boss behind all trade.

43:00.767 --> 43:03.766
Until then, I'm sorry. I can't help you.

43:03.839 --> 43:06.134
I won't do it.

43:07.376 --> 43:10.280
You have until dark to come to your senses.

43:10.345 --> 43:12.975
At that point, I will withdraw my men

43:13.048 --> 43:16.218
and the business of the street
becomes your business alone.

43:17.756 --> 43:20.355
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

43:37.403 --> 43:38.973
Oh, no! Get down!

44:08.102 --> 44:10.103
Take this.

44:10.168 --> 44:11.767
Checked all the dead and injured.

44:11.840 --> 44:13.843
None of them are Bryson.

44:13.908 --> 44:16.550
He only left three men to
defend the quarterdeck bunker.

44:16.615 --> 44:18.581
How does that make sense?

44:18.654 --> 44:21.718
The vanguard are on their
way to clear the cargo hold.

44:21.791 --> 44:24.788
Maybe Bryson is hiding down there.

44:24.853 --> 44:26.588
Something's not right.

44:26.661 --> 44:29.564
Captain, the rudder's not responding.

44:29.629 --> 44:32.225
Someone must've cut the
mechanism below decks.

44:34.866 --> 44:36.329
Call back the vanguard.

45:02.924 --> 45:04.826
Three men dead on their end, Captain.

45:04.899 --> 45:08.302
Perhaps it's time we sent them our terms.

45:52.269 --> 45:54.403
I do apologize for this.

45:56.108 --> 45:59.877
Mr. Guthrie's orders were explicit.

45:59.942 --> 46:03.781
No matter what, I was to make
sure that you were on this ship.

46:03.847 --> 46:05.885
This was not the deal.

46:08.086 --> 46:11.651
Assist the Andromache to depart unmolested

46:11.724 --> 46:13.227
and you can remain with the girl

46:13.292 --> 46:15.891
and pick up the pieces
and explain yourself.

46:17.563 --> 46:21.362
Mr. Scott, you sided with
his daughter against him.

46:21.435 --> 46:23.666
You forgot your duty.

46:23.731 --> 46:26.065
You must have known there
would be consequences.

46:28.373 --> 46:32.216
But we men of duty must often
put our feelings aside...

46:33.385 --> 46:35.383
as you're about to witness.

46:48.297 --> 46:51.734
Do it.

46:57.673 --> 47:02.347
And this one?

47:30.481 --> 47:33.817
At the risk of overstepping my bounds,

47:33.889 --> 47:36.490
I think you should agree to
Captain Hornigold's terms.

47:38.590 --> 47:41.851
Lift the ban. What do you care about...

47:41.924 --> 47:43.524
They're beating her.

47:44.958 --> 47:46.294
She chose it.

47:46.359 --> 47:49.903
"She chose it"?

47:49.968 --> 47:53.240
"She chose it."

47:53.305 --> 47:55.179
I've been repeating those words to myself

47:55.244 --> 47:58.749
for well over a week now
and I find them wanting.

47:58.814 --> 48:01.854
Now he asks me to back off Charles,

48:01.919 --> 48:05.024
to proclaim to the world that
what happened to Max is acceptable,

48:05.089 --> 48:08.158
to apologize to those animals
for having ever said otherwise,

48:08.223 --> 48:10.228
and smile while they lord it over me.

48:10.293 --> 48:13.992
To make a dangerous situation
a lot less dangerous.

48:16.191 --> 48:18.325
Then convince me.

48:20.294 --> 48:23.331
Convince me that I should
betray her a second time...

48:25.069 --> 48:27.932
because that's what it
feels like I would be doing.

48:29.942 --> 48:33.007
Max chose.

48:33.080 --> 48:36.615
Why? I don't know.

48:36.680 --> 48:40.859
Maybe it was spite, maybe it was strength,

48:40.924 --> 48:43.394
maybe it was who the fuck knows what.

48:43.459 --> 48:45.887
To be perfectly honest, I don't care

48:45.960 --> 48:47.894
because the moment I start making choices

48:47.959 --> 48:49.759
based on her decisions,

48:49.824 --> 48:52.327
I've given her a hell of a
lot more power over my life

48:52.400 --> 48:55.135
than I am quite comfortable
ceding to a perfect stranger.

48:58.269 --> 49:00.365
Guilt is natural.

49:01.575 --> 49:05.908
It also goes away if you let it.

49:07.206 --> 49:10.245
Losing your life's work...

49:10.310 --> 49:12.779
that doesn't go away.

49:14.348 --> 49:16.886
No fucking longer!

49:18.119 --> 49:20.125
Captain?

49:20.190 --> 49:22.788
Charles?

49:22.861 --> 49:27.291
Do I understand correctly
that you've requested a skiff?

49:27.364 --> 49:29.467
I suppose that's none of my business,

49:29.532 --> 49:33.636
but you do realize that we
may be able to hunt again soon.

49:33.701 --> 49:36.037
What I'm hearing is all
second and thirdhand,

49:36.110 --> 49:39.775
but something is happening in that tavern.

49:40.849 --> 49:43.249
Our problem isn't in there.

49:43.314 --> 49:45.018
Never was.

49:49.228 --> 49:51.460
What the hell are you talking about?

49:51.525 --> 49:53.629
Chaz?

49:58.970 --> 50:00.935
Where are you going?

50:06.071 --> 50:07.502
Where is he?

50:07.575 --> 50:09.070
He's in a reinforced hold

50:09.142 --> 50:10.573
directly beneath us here.

50:10.638 --> 50:12.508
Forward end of the lower gundeck.

50:12.573 --> 50:16.212
Doors as thick as the
outer hull, as is the roof.

50:16.277 --> 50:18.213
Impossible to breach from here.

50:18.286 --> 50:21.179
He's also sitting right in
front of a powder magazine,

50:21.252 --> 50:23.251
so if we try to blow our way through,

50:23.316 --> 50:25.755
this whole ship is going down fast.

50:25.820 --> 50:27.322
Unless we can find a way in,

50:27.387 --> 50:29.424
there's no way to get
the guns off the boat.

50:29.489 --> 50:32.559
Anybody we send down there is
just gonna get cut to shreds.

50:32.624 --> 50:35.662
And we cannot sail.

50:35.727 --> 50:37.260
And we cannot sail.

50:38.957 --> 50:40.563
It doesn't make sense.

50:43.268 --> 50:45.236
If Bryson wants to force us to withdraw,

50:45.301 --> 50:48.203
what's to stop me from
burning the ship once we leave?

50:51.342 --> 50:53.477
We're missing something.

51:06.793 --> 51:08.496
There you are.

51:10.433 --> 51:12.570
Been looking all over for you.

51:12.635 --> 51:15.234
Thought I'd get a head start
going through Bryson's papers.

51:19.213 --> 51:21.445
Jameson.

51:21.510 --> 51:24.115
Beg your pardon?

51:24.180 --> 51:27.379
You said no man ever died
his first time over the side,

51:27.452 --> 51:30.254
but you forgot about Tom Jameson,

51:30.319 --> 51:33.293
boatswain's mate, about two years back.

51:33.359 --> 51:35.126
That's right.

51:35.191 --> 51:39.665
Also Christian Thoms,
Will Robbins, Jean DuBois,

51:39.738 --> 51:41.734
that Portuguese guy with the lisp...

51:41.799 --> 51:44.331
what was his name?

51:44.404 --> 51:46.571
That is funny.

51:46.636 --> 51:49.111
Thank you...

51:49.176 --> 51:50.605
for doing that.

51:53.042 --> 51:54.303
It helped.

52:04.151 --> 52:06.885
Miranda Barlow?

52:13.592 --> 52:15.158
Away from the hatch!

52:15.223 --> 52:16.959
Everyone!

52:35.689 --> 52:38.193
Captain Flint.

52:51.813 --> 52:55.814
He says, "I'm secure in the hold below."

53:02.256 --> 53:07.060
"With 20 of my men. I
can wait, but you cannot."

53:13.737 --> 53:16.304
"Before departing,"

53:16.376 --> 53:19.546
I sent a message to the
captain of the Scarborough.

53:19.611 --> 53:21.779
I told him where I was headed,

53:21.852 --> 53:24.850
"and I told him where he would find you."

53:24.915 --> 53:27.784
Sail to the east!

53:31.824 --> 53:33.825
Good God.

53:33.890 --> 53:35.794
The Scarborough!

53:39.097 --> 53:40.400
Look out!
