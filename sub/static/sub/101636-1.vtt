00:09.166 --> 00:12.791
NETFLIX PRESENTS

02:27.666 --> 02:28.541
Hey!

02:29.958 --> 02:30.958
Is anybody there?

02:54.875 --> 02:56.083
Jesus Christ!

03:01.458 --> 03:02.291
Grab my hand.

03:06.208 --> 03:07.041
Reach out.

03:10.583 --> 03:11.583
Alright.

03:12.083 --> 03:12.958
Try again.

03:13.833 --> 03:14.666
Come on!

03:18.250 --> 03:19.500
I'll get some help.

03:33.666 --> 03:39.583
30 YEARS LATER

04:24.291 --> 04:25.208
Dust it off.

04:32.875 --> 04:34.166
Morning, guys.

04:34.333 --> 04:38.500
We get out and get rid
of all the unnecessary stuff.

04:39.791 --> 04:41.041
You know what I mean.

04:42.458 --> 04:44.208
Just as the rules say.

04:45.416 --> 04:46.250
Follow me.

04:48.875 --> 04:51.708
All electronic devices, please!

04:51.791 --> 04:53.791
-Julek Rosiejka.
-Spell it.

04:53.958 --> 04:56.041
R-O-S-I-E-J-K-A.

04:56.125 --> 04:56.958
Just kidding.

04:57.916 --> 05:00.541
-Sokołowski.
-Like the sausages producer?

05:01.291 --> 05:02.291
I hate them.

05:04.041 --> 05:05.125
-Next!
-Kowalczyk.

05:05.666 --> 05:07.166
-Thanks.
-Czajka.

05:07.291 --> 05:10.208
Move it, guys!
We have better things to do.

05:11.416 --> 05:14.250
And the tablet. Come on, chop chop!

05:14.333 --> 05:17.250
-And if it gets lost?
-You get lost.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.041
Aniela Turek.

05:19.333 --> 05:21.333
-Wait!
-Aniela Turek.

05:25.083 --> 05:27.166
-I'll take it.
-Check.

05:28.083 --> 05:28.916
Wójcik.

05:29.333 --> 05:31.541
-Speed it up! Name?
-Wrońska.

05:31.625 --> 05:33.500
Why so sad? You are at camp.

05:33.916 --> 05:35.666
-Zosia Wolska.
-Another one.

05:35.750 --> 05:39.250
Take your luggage and gather here!

05:40.458 --> 05:42.583
Move along, buddy. Come on.

05:44.250 --> 05:47.375
-Next.
-Take your luggage off the bus!

05:48.666 --> 05:51.375
Chop chop, get some life into it, move it!

06:36.833 --> 06:41.125
Some of you are here
for the second or even the third time.

06:41.333 --> 06:42.208
Robert.

06:43.541 --> 06:44.666
I am not surprised.

06:46.625 --> 06:48.916
It makes me happy, though.

06:49.416 --> 06:51.916
You know it's worth it and it's fun.

06:52.583 --> 06:56.583
I want this camp
to be a kind of holiday for you.

06:57.583 --> 07:00.416
We'll have fun, we'll make new friends,

07:00.708 --> 07:04.166
we'll enjoy the nature,
while dealing with our problems.

07:04.458 --> 07:05.583
Why are you here?

07:06.666 --> 07:10.500
Because you're addicted
to your smartphones and laptops!

07:11.416 --> 07:13.708
To electronics, to technology!

07:15.583 --> 07:17.750
Is it really so hard be offline?

07:20.166 --> 07:24.333
This camp will demonstrate
that apart from being easy,

07:24.666 --> 07:27.000
it is awesomely pleasant and fantastic!

07:27.958 --> 07:29.416
You'll learn new skills.

07:30.166 --> 07:31.875
You'll rediscover yourselves.

07:32.541 --> 07:34.500
Kids, a hearty welcome

07:34.750 --> 07:38.666
to our offline survival
and trekking camp Adrenaline.

07:38.750 --> 07:39.625
Bravo!

07:48.666 --> 07:50.916
-Here you go.
-Draw your numbers!

07:52.000 --> 07:52.833
Go on.

07:52.916 --> 07:57.208
The numbers represent different groups.

07:58.708 --> 08:01.625
-What's the best one?
-Each group has a different task,

08:01.708 --> 08:04.208
but there is one goal
and common objective…

08:04.291 --> 08:05.166
adventure!

08:06.625 --> 08:09.500
You'll be off into the wild on your own.

08:10.625 --> 08:12.041
Away from civilization.

08:12.750 --> 08:13.625
I'm four too.

08:13.708 --> 08:18.333
Facing the wildlife dangers
every step of your way.

08:18.833 --> 08:22.791
You will meet savage beasts.
Maybe even some local madmen.

08:23.375 --> 08:28.333
A week of adventure and awesome fun.
Your one and only chance!

08:28.875 --> 08:30.291
All of which is offline!

08:31.833 --> 08:33.083
Adrenaline!

08:40.500 --> 08:43.166
It's out of tune, check it out.

08:46.208 --> 08:47.083
Robert.

08:48.666 --> 08:52.416
-Mustard only.
-Is there any vegan sausage?

08:54.291 --> 08:55.708
Fuck, I don't eat meat!

08:55.791 --> 08:56.708
It's all right.

08:57.166 --> 08:58.000
Play it.

08:58.708 --> 09:01.875
-With mustard.
-Mustard and ketchup for me.

09:02.875 --> 09:05.500
-Smaller or bigger sausage?
-A bigger one.

09:09.416 --> 09:11.625
Let's sing together now.

09:11.708 --> 09:13.916
-Ketchup, mustard?
-Mustard.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.333
You all know this one.

09:17.083 --> 09:19.333
-With bread or without?
-With.

09:19.416 --> 09:20.708
-Join in.
-With bread.

09:21.041 --> 09:24.458
A week off of Instagram is really cool.

09:24.750 --> 09:26.791
You don't get the info

09:27.208 --> 09:30.625
about who's in New York,
on Bali, in Sri Lanka,

09:30.708 --> 09:33.208
who's running the marathon,

09:33.291 --> 09:37.041
who's having halibut
with sun-dried tomatoes and green pepper.

09:37.375 --> 09:39.666
This makes me feel stupid,
because I only run

09:39.750 --> 09:43.458
when the elevator is out of order,
stay home and eat noodles with ketchup.

09:44.583 --> 09:47.416
And here you know nothing. Pure detox.

10:28.083 --> 10:28.916
Hey.

10:29.500 --> 10:30.833
Ewa, come on!

10:33.791 --> 10:35.083
Attention, campers!

10:36.000 --> 10:37.875
Fifteen minutes to lights-out!

12:32.958 --> 12:34.666
ADRENALINE – OFFLINE TREKKING CAMP

12:34.750 --> 12:35.958
Wakey-wakey, guys!

12:49.750 --> 12:52.083
-Hot water is on!
-Coming!

12:56.125 --> 12:57.208
Hey, that's my paper!

12:58.166 --> 13:01.416
MEN'S ROOM

13:25.416 --> 13:27.958
God Almighty, I'm asking You,

13:28.041 --> 13:31.500
through the Blessed Virgin
and all the Holy Angels,

13:31.875 --> 13:34.583
grace us with the will
to chase away the evil

13:34.666 --> 13:37.375
from those young addicted hearts.

13:38.000 --> 13:42.166
Through the Passion of our Lord Jesus,
His holy blood He shed for us,

13:42.250 --> 13:45.250
through His wounds and His agony.

13:46.000 --> 13:49.208
Jesus, send down your angels,
so they may drive…

13:50.041 --> 13:53.875
the sinister forces of civilization
into the depths of Hell.

13:53.958 --> 13:57.791
Let Your Kingdom
enter the hearts of your servants

13:57.875 --> 14:00.000
and relieve them of their evil addictions.

14:20.625 --> 14:21.458
Hi!

14:22.125 --> 14:24.958
I'm Iza, your group leader.

14:26.541 --> 14:27.958
Girls, are you comfortable?

14:33.583 --> 14:34.500
Thank you.

14:34.833 --> 14:39.166
We're off for a three-day hike.
It's a heck of a trip,

14:39.250 --> 14:44.000
so we stay close, we make an effort,
we keep up, and no one lags behind.

14:44.083 --> 14:45.041
Is that clear?

14:46.041 --> 14:48.166
Who is the slowest one in the group?

14:49.416 --> 14:52.708
And why is everyone looking at...
What's your name?

14:53.458 --> 14:54.666
-Julek.
-Julek?

14:55.541 --> 14:58.541
He'll surprise you all, you'll see.
Well, off we go!

15:47.833 --> 15:48.750
Hi there.

15:50.958 --> 15:54.166
Your necklace looks just like T-800.

15:55.125 --> 15:55.958
Excuse me?

15:56.416 --> 15:58.458
T-800. Arnold from The Terminator.

16:01.125 --> 16:04.250
No, that's just a family memento.

16:06.666 --> 16:11.166
But it really looks like T-800.
And you look a bit like Sarah Connor.

16:13.166 --> 16:14.708
Wasn't she a blonde?

16:16.291 --> 16:17.375
I mean your face.

17:02.708 --> 17:05.208
-Do you play any sports?
-Nope.

17:05.708 --> 17:08.125
-Do you?
-Ah, you know...

17:09.375 --> 17:10.375
not much.

17:10.916 --> 17:12.500
You look athletic, though.

17:12.958 --> 17:13.916
Ah, you know...

17:15.333 --> 17:16.875
In my spare time...

17:17.708 --> 17:18.750
Right!

17:19.208 --> 17:22.583
Gym and pool every day,
and weekend marathons, huh?

17:22.833 --> 17:23.750
Yeah.

17:24.916 --> 17:29.458
A bit of swimming, a bit of cycling.

17:38.833 --> 17:39.708
Hey, Daniel?

17:40.125 --> 17:40.958
What?

17:42.458 --> 17:44.166
-Are you a selfie fan?
-Jesus!

17:45.458 --> 17:46.291
What?

17:47.250 --> 17:49.166
Do you like taking selfies?

17:49.750 --> 17:52.708
-Fuck off, pal.
-You do, don't you?

17:54.375 --> 17:57.583
-Do you shave your legs too?
-Bartek, leave him be.

17:58.791 --> 18:00.541
-Daniel?
-I'll shave yours.

18:00.916 --> 18:04.458
Cyclists shave, maybe you are a pro.

18:04.541 --> 18:07.208
-Bartek!
-Maybe you like sucking dick.

18:08.583 --> 18:10.458
Jesus!  Bartek!

18:11.541 --> 18:13.000
-Are you nuts?
-What was that?

18:13.875 --> 18:16.750
Everything okay? You're just like him.

18:22.083 --> 18:22.916
Okay.

18:23.958 --> 18:26.291
Alright. Let's get it cleaned up.

18:27.125 --> 18:28.791
Right so. Enough.

18:29.500 --> 18:30.791
Give me two of those.

18:34.250 --> 18:35.958
You're not so eloquent now.

18:42.250 --> 18:43.083
Okay.

18:45.750 --> 18:46.833
And now...

18:53.708 --> 18:55.291
Gosh, I have no scissors.

19:10.875 --> 19:12.791
All set. Let's move.

19:13.625 --> 19:14.625
Can you get up?

19:15.708 --> 19:17.625
-Sorry.
-I got carried away.

19:18.666 --> 19:20.666
Can I go for a quick pee?

19:21.208 --> 19:22.083
Hurry up.

19:22.875 --> 19:23.916
Let's get ready.

19:24.875 --> 19:26.083
Backpacks on.

19:29.500 --> 19:30.375
Help me.

19:50.916 --> 19:51.791
Oh shit!

19:55.125 --> 19:55.958
Fuck me!

19:58.375 --> 19:59.291
Shit.

20:02.875 --> 20:03.958
Come over here!

20:25.666 --> 20:27.416
-Hunters?
-Nope.

20:30.750 --> 20:31.791
Not hunters.

20:33.166 --> 20:34.708
A carnivore of some sort.

20:35.583 --> 20:36.416
A big one.

20:42.750 --> 20:46.166
Fifteen thousand people
disappear in Poland each year,

20:46.250 --> 20:47.708
a third of them in the woods.

20:49.250 --> 20:52.750
-We'll beat the statistics.
-That's not funny.

21:15.041 --> 21:17.708
Is this your first time in a forest?

21:18.750 --> 21:20.750
-Relax.
-That's right.

21:21.458 --> 21:25.583
Animals don't attack for no reason.
And Totter-Tot will protect us.

21:26.458 --> 21:27.375
Let's move on!

21:51.166 --> 21:52.875
That deer was something else, huh?

21:54.875 --> 21:57.666
Did you watch
An American Werewolf in London?

21:58.708 --> 22:00.083
It goes like this:

22:00.583 --> 22:05.291
two guys go hiking through the woods,
just like us now.

22:05.708 --> 22:08.708
They walk and hear a kind of growling.

22:10.291 --> 22:12.750
Like a dog, a rabbit, or a wolf.

22:13.291 --> 22:15.416
They ignore it and walk on.

22:15.708 --> 22:20.000
And there's that growling again,
kind of circling them.

22:20.708 --> 22:23.875
They keep walking,
and one of them gets attacked!

22:24.166 --> 22:26.041
He gets his arm bitten off...

23:35.500 --> 23:36.375
Daniel?

23:39.833 --> 23:42.583
-Yeah?
-I have no idea how to do it.

23:47.833 --> 23:48.791
Maybe like this?

23:51.750 --> 23:52.875
I'll do it.

23:54.666 --> 23:56.916
I need to bathe,
I feel icky after that walk.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.416
Julek, why are you here?

24:50.125 --> 24:51.625
-Games.
-Computer games?

24:53.791 --> 24:54.916
And console ones.

24:57.958 --> 24:59.166
Go on, Julek.

24:59.958 --> 25:01.166
Everyone shares.

25:04.416 --> 25:05.291
Go on.

25:06.291 --> 25:07.250
I play games.

25:09.791 --> 25:12.250
The second best player in Poland.

25:13.583 --> 25:16.166
I stream, I run a YouTube channel.

25:16.875 --> 25:18.833
-I planned...
-How many subs?

25:18.916 --> 25:21.875
-…championships in Korea.
-How many subs?

25:22.458 --> 25:25.833
-I have a channel too.
-Exactly 900,334.

25:29.833 --> 25:30.750
And you?

25:33.333 --> 25:35.916
-More or less the same.
-Julek, go on.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.208
You mentioned Korea.

25:39.375 --> 25:42.875
I was planning to take part
in the championship games,

25:44.083 --> 25:47.958
but my parents cut me off the internet
and sent me here.

25:49.083 --> 25:51.875
-On probation.
-There are camps in Korea too.

25:56.083 --> 25:56.916
Joke.

25:57.500 --> 25:59.666
You can win half a million dollars.

26:00.083 --> 26:02.958
So, you dropped out of school,
because...

26:04.541 --> 26:06.000
you overdid the internet, right?

26:07.041 --> 26:09.375
Anyone else flunk out for this reason?

26:16.958 --> 26:17.791
Nobody.

26:18.291 --> 26:22.333
Just like I thought.
And I heard that all of you did.

26:23.791 --> 26:25.166
And it's Zosia's turn.

26:27.791 --> 26:29.000
Zosia Wolska.

26:31.333 --> 26:32.416
What have we here?

26:33.791 --> 26:34.708
Zosia.

26:44.875 --> 26:46.666
Let's leave that for tomorrow.

26:50.291 --> 26:52.000
Or whenever you'd like. Okay?

26:56.916 --> 26:58.291
-Hear that?
-What is it?

26:58.833 --> 27:02.291
-Shush, shush...
-Something's out there.

27:09.333 --> 27:10.208
Sit!

27:17.416 --> 27:18.250
Stay put.

27:34.250 --> 27:35.083
Miss Iza?

27:36.666 --> 27:39.166
-Yeah?
-Be careful.

27:40.000 --> 27:40.875
Good idea.

28:04.916 --> 28:05.833
What a cutie.

28:06.833 --> 28:08.208
A little fox.

28:08.291 --> 28:10.666
I wish you'd seen him. Enough for today.

28:10.750 --> 28:12.708
-You all shit your pants.
-Bedtime!

28:59.166 --> 29:01.041
Puffety puff.

29:18.791 --> 29:19.833
That's better.

29:30.333 --> 29:31.375
Jesus.

29:33.333 --> 29:35.166
Wanna give me a heart attack?

29:36.875 --> 29:38.875
I can't sleep with all that noise.

29:40.500 --> 29:41.375
What noise?

29:42.500 --> 29:45.125
All those crickets, owls,

29:46.125 --> 29:47.500
ticks and what not.

29:51.125 --> 29:54.000
-And how about you?
-Just chillin'.

29:55.291 --> 29:57.250
So I see. Give me a hit.

29:59.416 --> 30:00.333
You smoke?

30:07.958 --> 30:09.541
We have similar names.

30:11.666 --> 30:12.500
Really?

30:14.125 --> 30:17.958
Daniel, Aniela.
Add a D, take away the A.

30:18.333 --> 30:21.583
Coincidence? I don't think so.
Do you have a girlfriend?

30:21.791 --> 30:23.000
No. I mean, yes.

30:25.541 --> 30:28.500
Sometimes. You know how it is.

30:30.833 --> 30:31.791
No, I don't.

30:33.041 --> 30:33.875
Well…

30:35.333 --> 30:40.166
I date several girls. Depends on the day.

30:43.500 --> 30:44.583
Got something too.

30:52.333 --> 30:53.541
You know what it is?

30:58.958 --> 30:59.833
So?

31:01.500 --> 31:04.333
-Meaning?
-You want me to help you?

31:05.250 --> 31:07.250
No, there's no need… I mean…

31:08.916 --> 31:10.000
No.

31:12.666 --> 31:13.875
I don't need help.

31:24.083 --> 31:24.958
What's wrong?

31:27.041 --> 31:30.000
Nah... nothing.

31:32.458 --> 31:33.333
You're gay?

31:34.708 --> 31:35.583
No.

31:37.083 --> 31:38.500
I just...

31:41.583 --> 31:42.583
It's the nerves.

31:45.041 --> 31:45.916
I dunno.

31:49.708 --> 31:50.583
No...

31:51.750 --> 31:52.791
You're a virgin?

31:59.291 --> 32:02.416
-And you said you had someone.
-I did.

32:04.541 --> 32:05.625
Over the Internet.

32:08.541 --> 32:10.208
So you've only had cybersex?

32:14.708 --> 32:15.583
Sorry.

32:32.291 --> 32:35.583
In that case, call me "Teacher."

33:43.125 --> 33:44.166
How was it?

33:53.416 --> 33:54.375
I need to crash.

33:55.583 --> 33:57.291
But we'll do it again, right?

33:59.708 --> 34:02.500
We'll see. Goodnight!

34:04.166 --> 34:05.041
Thanks.

34:23.666 --> 34:25.041
Wait.

34:26.833 --> 34:27.958
Let's get this out.

34:29.750 --> 34:30.583
Right.

34:31.458 --> 34:32.833
Before falling asleep.

36:48.458 --> 36:50.916
Julek! Wake Zosia and Daniel up.

36:52.500 --> 36:54.458
-He's not here.
-What do you mean?

36:55.625 --> 36:57.833
Just like that. He's not in his tent.

36:59.250 --> 37:02.166
-Maybe he went to shave his legs.
-So where is he?

37:02.250 --> 37:03.791
Anyone seen Daniel?

37:04.958 --> 37:08.541
-Did he say he was leaving?
-How should I know?

37:09.833 --> 37:13.083
-Who's seen him last?
-Maybe something happened to him?

37:25.291 --> 37:28.125
Alright.
Who was the last person to see him?

37:36.166 --> 37:39.125
Me. We sat by the water together.

37:40.166 --> 37:41.041
And?

37:42.000 --> 37:43.291
Now I'm pregnant.

37:48.500 --> 37:49.875
Show me the exact spot.

38:00.125 --> 38:01.125
That's not mine.

38:06.166 --> 38:09.000
-What else did you two do?
-Nothing.

38:10.791 --> 38:12.291
You had to do something.

38:12.583 --> 38:16.458
We sat, we chatted, I went to bed.

38:16.916 --> 38:18.458
That's cool.

38:19.375 --> 38:20.791
What did you talk about?

38:21.333 --> 38:22.791
Just piss off.

38:23.833 --> 38:25.833
-Why won't you tell me?
-Fuck off.

38:29.000 --> 38:29.916
Take a look.

38:37.750 --> 38:38.750
Looks like blood.

38:39.500 --> 38:41.916
-That's massive.
-What's up?

38:44.458 --> 38:45.333
Blood.

38:49.791 --> 38:50.750
No, that is...

38:53.333 --> 38:56.791
-What?
-That's probably sap.

38:57.833 --> 39:02.541
-That color sap?
-Sure, a lot of trees secrete juices.

39:02.625 --> 39:06.083
-What are they called?
-They don't grow in Poland.

39:06.208 --> 39:09.041
-They sometimes do.
-Like where?

39:09.416 --> 39:12.041
-Like here.
-That's blood.

39:12.125 --> 39:15.666
No. That's...

39:15.958 --> 39:18.291
Listen, stop panicking, alright?

39:18.375 --> 39:21.166
-We should look for him.
-Or head back.

39:21.541 --> 39:23.375
Okay, go back and look.

39:23.833 --> 39:26.041
Let's take a vote. I say we get back.

39:26.125 --> 39:28.541
Stop panicking. Alright.

39:28.625 --> 39:32.166
Bartek and Aniela stay here
in case Daniel shows up.

39:32.500 --> 39:34.000
Don't go anywhere, clear?

39:34.833 --> 39:38.333
-Zosia and I will look around.
-So we're splitting up?

39:38.625 --> 39:41.125
-We have to.
-Can I say something?

39:41.208 --> 39:43.208
-Be brief.
-In horror movies,

39:43.291 --> 39:47.583
when groups split up, people die.

39:47.666 --> 39:48.500
Julek, please!

39:48.583 --> 39:49.541
Relax.

39:50.375 --> 39:54.750
I'd feel more relaxed
if we called the police.

39:54.833 --> 39:56.750
We have no phones.

39:56.833 --> 40:01.500
If we don't find him in an hour,
we'll head back to base. Clear?

40:01.583 --> 40:02.583
-Yeah.
-Let's go.

40:03.291 --> 40:06.250
-And what about me?
-I don't know... stay.

40:06.750 --> 40:07.958
Wait for the police.

40:18.000 --> 40:18.875
What a bummer.

40:21.375 --> 40:22.250
Daniel!

40:28.791 --> 40:30.750
-Can I say one more thing?
-No!

40:36.791 --> 40:39.333
In horror movies,
there are six deadly sins.

40:41.583 --> 40:45.208
Curiosity. "I wonder what's inside,
Let's take a peep."

40:46.083 --> 40:47.250
Disbelief.

40:48.791 --> 40:51.541
"It's just my imagination,
no need to fear."

40:52.083 --> 40:55.791
Confidence.
"I'm going inside. Why shouldn't I?"

40:57.416 --> 40:58.750
That was number three.

40:59.541 --> 41:02.916
Number four:
unattractive people never survive.

41:03.208 --> 41:04.541
Five: sex.

41:05.791 --> 41:07.416
Sex is a death sentence.

41:08.708 --> 41:12.000
And six: splitting up,
just like we are doing now.

41:14.416 --> 41:15.291
Let me.

41:16.458 --> 41:17.333
Thanks.

41:24.541 --> 41:26.375
What if they don't come back?

41:30.375 --> 41:31.750
Why wouldn't they?

41:34.916 --> 41:35.750
No idea.

41:37.291 --> 41:38.291
Hypothetically.

41:40.291 --> 41:42.875
If we were left alone here…

41:46.041 --> 41:47.125
what would you do?

42:06.791 --> 42:07.666
What's that?

42:10.791 --> 42:11.750
Let's go in.

42:12.708 --> 42:16.250
-But it's private property.
-Julek!

42:17.250 --> 42:19.791
Give it a break.
Maybe they've seen Daniel.

42:22.458 --> 42:23.666
I won't fit through.

42:27.666 --> 42:28.541
Hello?

42:36.583 --> 42:37.916
What a fucking mess.

43:00.833 --> 43:01.833
Good morning!

43:13.458 --> 43:14.416
Is anybody here?

43:15.666 --> 43:16.541
Excuse me.

44:25.583 --> 44:27.375
No one's here; let's go back.

44:37.333 --> 44:39.000
-Did you hear that?
-Yes.

44:50.166 --> 44:51.083
Hi, little one.

44:57.666 --> 44:58.541
Wait...

45:03.250 --> 45:04.125
Miss Iza...

45:04.916 --> 45:05.958
Miss Iza...

45:07.916 --> 45:09.000
Zosia, be careful.

45:42.541 --> 45:43.416
Oh, Jesus.

46:08.125 --> 46:09.208
Someone's coming!

46:15.666 --> 46:16.750
Let's fucking run!

46:18.083 --> 46:19.708
-He's coming!
-Hide, quick!

46:21.291 --> 46:23.125
Someone's fucking coming!

46:57.000 --> 46:57.958
Quiet!

47:12.000 --> 47:12.875
Be quiet.

47:15.875 --> 47:18.708
-Calm down. Get a grip.
-Fuck.

47:38.916 --> 47:39.750
Quick!

47:42.166 --> 47:43.583
I can't climb!

47:43.666 --> 47:44.958
Hurry up!

47:45.708 --> 47:46.666
Hurry!

47:56.875 --> 47:57.916
Miss Iza!

48:00.875 --> 48:01.750
Run!

48:10.125 --> 48:13.000
Come on, you pizzaface motherfucker!

48:24.500 --> 48:26.416
-Fuck.
-Miss Iza?

48:36.791 --> 48:38.375
I always knew I was gay.

48:39.708 --> 48:40.833
You just feel it.

48:43.125 --> 48:44.833
But still, I need to hide it.

48:46.333 --> 48:49.458
Try being gay in this country.

48:50.583 --> 48:51.458
It sucks.

48:52.458 --> 48:56.375
-Don't take it to heart.
-Seriously?

48:57.583 --> 49:00.333
You're a nice, intelligent guy.

49:02.875 --> 49:05.000
I am constantly being labeled too.

49:05.791 --> 49:07.541
A dumb bimbo, a blonde.

49:09.416 --> 49:11.166
Just good enough for a fuck.

49:13.333 --> 49:16.666
But I just ignore the rules,
and I'm happy with it.

49:18.166 --> 49:22.541
But deep inside, I wish I could find...

49:23.958 --> 49:25.083
true love.

49:27.708 --> 49:28.708
A real true love.

49:35.416 --> 49:36.416
Is he chasing us?

49:39.625 --> 49:40.500
Now what?

49:42.375 --> 49:43.250
I don't know.

49:45.791 --> 49:48.958
It's fucking over.
What are we going to do?

49:50.125 --> 49:53.958
Fucking locals, B class Poland.
What am I doing here?

49:54.041 --> 49:56.458
I told you all not to come here!

49:56.541 --> 49:59.833
But nobody listened!
I want to go home!

50:00.666 --> 50:01.666
Pull it together.

50:07.916 --> 50:08.791
Julek.

50:11.250 --> 50:13.750
It will be alright, okay? Just calm down.

50:21.208 --> 50:25.541
-We should go back for Daniel's phone.
-No, let's not do that.

50:25.916 --> 50:26.791
Please.

50:36.750 --> 50:38.916
Okay, listen. Here's what we'll do.

50:39.166 --> 50:41.500
We'll move on and we'll find some help.

50:42.375 --> 50:43.333
We can do this.

50:45.791 --> 50:46.625
Promise?

50:51.916 --> 50:52.791
Promise.

50:54.333 --> 50:56.541
My father is so blind...

50:59.208 --> 51:02.916
He'd sooner believe I was
a far right extremist than a faggot.

51:05.083 --> 51:07.958
I guess that's his fantasy of me.

51:10.541 --> 51:14.000
Even when I invite a boyfriend home…

51:16.041 --> 51:17.708
he thinks it's just a buddy.

51:19.708 --> 51:23.583
If I ever grabbed my "buddy's" butt
in front of him,

51:24.333 --> 51:27.333
he'd be likely to think... I don't know.

51:28.125 --> 51:30.791
He'd take it for a macho goodbye.

51:34.750 --> 51:35.875
The guy is...

51:37.041 --> 51:39.541
so fucking out of touch with reality.

52:54.750 --> 52:58.166
Let's go back to Aniela and Bartek,
if they're still alive.

52:58.791 --> 53:02.125
-Don't say that!
-We wouldn’t find them anyway.

53:02.333 --> 53:05.708
We have no idea where we are,
we're running in circles.

53:06.291 --> 53:09.333
If the fat guy doesn't kill us,
starvation will.

53:09.416 --> 53:14.958
I can't imagine us fishing,
eating moss, hunting, or mushroom picking.

53:15.041 --> 53:18.291
-Poor Miss Iza--
-Shut it!

53:55.250 --> 53:56.083
Hello?

53:57.583 --> 53:58.541
Open up!

54:03.166 --> 54:05.625
Good morning. Will you help us?

54:05.916 --> 54:07.208
Our friends are dead.

54:08.625 --> 54:11.875
There was an accident, we need help.
Will you let us in?

54:29.416 --> 54:30.291
The door!

54:43.916 --> 54:46.333
Is there a phone here?
We need to make a call.

54:50.208 --> 54:51.541
Tell me what happened.

54:58.041 --> 55:01.250
I don't know how to say it,
as this will sound weird...

55:02.625 --> 55:06.166
-You won't believe us anyway.
-I've seen many strange things.

55:06.958 --> 55:12.125
We stumbled upon this huge fucker,
all crooked and deformed.

55:12.208 --> 55:16.333
He attacked us,
and then killed our friend and our guide.

55:16.791 --> 55:17.958
What? "Killed"?

55:20.750 --> 55:23.541
Something is fucked up,
and people are dying.

55:25.041 --> 55:27.625
Have you been drinking? Taking drugs?

55:29.625 --> 55:30.458
No.

55:38.291 --> 55:39.125
Alright.

55:41.166 --> 55:42.291
Calm down.

55:42.375 --> 55:46.125
I can't calm down!
I need to call the police or somebody!

55:46.208 --> 55:47.458
Or else we're doomed.

56:05.791 --> 56:06.666
Sit down.

56:19.291 --> 56:20.541
I don't have a phone.

56:20.875 --> 56:24.208
I have a cellphone,
but we're out of range.

56:25.333 --> 56:26.916
Let's try the landline.

56:35.916 --> 56:36.791
No signal.

56:37.791 --> 56:41.166
We've been having
some violent storms lately.

56:44.500 --> 56:46.500
We will go to the police station.

56:48.708 --> 56:51.750
But you claim
that people are getting killed.

56:54.083 --> 56:56.041
So would that be really safe?

57:06.375 --> 57:08.041
Calm down.

57:11.916 --> 57:12.833
Come on.

57:14.958 --> 57:15.833
There.

57:53.750 --> 57:54.750
Hi again.

57:58.541 --> 58:00.625
I remember you from last year.

58:02.916 --> 58:04.291
I know your kind.

58:07.250 --> 58:08.208
Clingy…

58:09.958 --> 58:10.916
Enticing...

58:13.041 --> 58:15.833
Ready to lure others in.

58:19.708 --> 58:21.291
You are a bit like…

58:22.875 --> 58:23.791
the plague.

58:35.791 --> 58:36.875
Wait here.

59:25.750 --> 59:26.666
Jesus!

1:02:04.333 --> 1:02:06.458
You don't know who you're dealing with.

1:02:08.208 --> 1:02:11.458
I first encountered them a long time ago.

1:02:13.333 --> 1:02:15.791
I have a souvenir after that meeting.

1:02:17.125 --> 1:02:18.708
I'll keep it till death.

1:02:22.291 --> 1:02:23.125
"Them"?

1:02:26.875 --> 1:02:27.833
Two of them.

1:02:29.291 --> 1:02:30.166
What?

1:02:37.125 --> 1:02:41.541
Once there was a family
living in those parts.

1:02:43.666 --> 1:02:46.416
A mom and her two boys. Twins.

1:02:48.458 --> 1:02:53.083
They led a rather poor life,
but they loved each other dearly.

1:02:54.250 --> 1:02:55.333
They were happy.

1:02:57.625 --> 1:03:00.625
And everything was fine
until one fateful afternoon.

1:04:19.875 --> 1:04:21.875
"Once upon a time,

1:04:23.333 --> 1:04:24.583
in her gloomy hut

1:04:25.875 --> 1:04:28.375
there lived a witch as ugly as a bat.

1:04:28.916 --> 1:04:31.250
She ate little girls for breakfast,

1:04:32.625 --> 1:04:34.791
and  little boys for dinner.

1:04:36.375 --> 1:04:38.666
She'd ride her broom

1:04:39.291 --> 1:04:41.958
to the village and back,

1:04:42.833 --> 1:04:46.750
to stuff plump little children
into her great big sack.

1:04:48.583 --> 1:04:50.500
But before they reached the pot,

1:04:51.458 --> 1:04:54.500
she would sing this to them:

1:04:55.375 --> 1:04:58.458
Nobody sleeps in the woods tonight.

1:05:00.041 --> 1:05:03.708
Nobody sleeps in the woods tonight."

1:05:05.958 --> 1:05:06.833
Goodnight.

1:05:08.541 --> 1:05:13.708
-Goodnight, mommy.
-Nobody sleeps in the woods tonight...

1:05:16.416 --> 1:05:20.208
Nobody sleeps in the woods tonight.

1:07:29.916 --> 1:07:30.958
In the name of…

1:07:51.291 --> 1:07:52.250
Boys?

1:09:16.125 --> 1:09:17.416
She was in a shock.

1:09:19.125 --> 1:09:22.333
She put them in chains
and locked them in the cellar,

1:09:23.041 --> 1:09:24.875
so that no one ever found out.

1:09:26.208 --> 1:09:28.208
And so that they'd never come out.

1:09:29.250 --> 1:09:34.083
Years passed
and she fed them and hid them.

1:09:34.833 --> 1:09:36.250
Until she lost her mind.

1:09:36.916 --> 1:09:38.833
Anyone would go insane.

1:09:42.166 --> 1:09:45.791
Poor dear woman, innocent as a lamb.

1:09:46.916 --> 1:09:47.833
All fucked up.

1:09:56.708 --> 1:09:59.833
We really have to go and get some help.

1:10:02.541 --> 1:10:04.541
Stay here, if you want to survive.

1:10:07.208 --> 1:10:08.750
I have some food and ammo.

1:10:11.291 --> 1:10:13.625
And we would just wait?

1:10:14.958 --> 1:10:18.250
-Maybe it's not such a bad idea?
-You're free to go.

1:10:19.041 --> 1:10:22.291
It will take you two days
to get to the nearest village.

1:10:25.916 --> 1:10:26.833
As you wish.

1:10:28.083 --> 1:10:28.958
Your choice.

1:10:38.791 --> 1:10:39.791
We have to act.

1:10:48.708 --> 1:10:51.875
Let's get Daniel's phone.
We have no choice.

1:11:34.291 --> 1:11:35.375
Zosia, be careful.

1:11:38.041 --> 1:11:39.791
-What's he doing?
-Get back!

1:11:42.041 --> 1:11:43.666
-Is he there?
-Shush!

1:11:43.958 --> 1:11:47.041
Get a grip! Here's what we're going to do.

1:11:47.416 --> 1:11:50.291
-We wait for him to leave.
-He may take a week.

1:11:50.375 --> 1:11:52.041
Do you have a better idea?

1:11:56.208 --> 1:11:57.083
Julek!

1:12:01.541 --> 1:12:04.458
I'll make some noise up front
and you go in.

1:12:04.541 --> 1:12:08.625
-Alright.
-I distract him, you grab the phone.

1:12:09.250 --> 1:12:10.083
Okay.

1:12:10.708 --> 1:12:11.666
No, wait!

1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:15.125
-What if he chases you?
-I'll run.

1:12:15.750 --> 1:12:18.500
-See you in a moment.
-Julek…

1:12:21.291 --> 1:12:22.500
can you run?

1:12:25.500 --> 1:12:27.416
Zosia, we can do it, right?

1:12:28.166 --> 1:12:29.541
We can do it.

1:12:30.916 --> 1:12:32.708
-Alright.
-Wait!

1:12:35.083 --> 1:12:36.833
Take this. Just in case.

1:13:31.750 --> 1:13:33.541
Open up, you fat asshole!

1:15:17.791 --> 1:15:18.708
Let her go!

1:15:31.833 --> 1:15:32.708
I'm sorry.

1:17:00.291 --> 1:17:01.125
Julek!

1:17:03.500 --> 1:17:04.375
Fuck!

1:17:06.958 --> 1:17:08.500
Julek!

1:17:12.208 --> 1:17:16.333
Wait, I'll call for help, just wait.
It will be alright.

1:18:29.625 --> 1:18:31.083
Hush, hush...

1:18:38.000 --> 1:18:39.291
What?

1:18:46.041 --> 1:18:47.166
I don't understand.

1:18:53.750 --> 1:18:55.291
I don't understand a word.

1:19:00.250 --> 1:19:01.666
Everything will be fine.

1:19:03.416 --> 1:19:04.500
It will be fine.

1:19:20.458 --> 1:19:21.541
Sarah Connor...

1:19:27.541 --> 1:19:29.125
That's not from The Terminator.

1:19:31.125 --> 1:19:32.458
That's Captain Walrus.

1:19:38.125 --> 1:19:41.000
I found him on summer holiday
I spent with my parents.

1:19:45.125 --> 1:19:48.125
My sister called him Captain Walrus,
you know.

1:19:55.125 --> 1:19:58.000
Put an end to this, please.

1:20:00.708 --> 1:20:01.833
Finish me off.

1:20:20.500 --> 1:20:24.041
No. I can't.

1:20:34.083 --> 1:20:34.958
No...

1:20:36.541 --> 1:20:37.375
No!

1:28:13.708 --> 1:28:16.833
Come on in... you motherfucker.

1:29:27.291 --> 1:29:31.458
The last call I had: a panicked guy called

1:29:31.541 --> 1:29:34.708
saying a black guy
was repairing the waterworks.

1:29:35.375 --> 1:29:38.291
And a woman was driving a bus.

1:29:38.375 --> 1:29:40.833
A woman behind the wheel?

1:29:41.791 --> 1:29:45.958
Once in a blue moon
something serious happens.

1:29:46.041 --> 1:29:49.500
I catch a drunk shithead driving.

1:29:49.791 --> 1:29:54.000
And it always turns out that his father
is someone important.

1:29:54.250 --> 1:29:57.000
And I get massive shit instead of a medal.

1:29:57.625 --> 1:30:00.791
Dear officer, this is Poland,
not Miami Vice.

1:30:02.291 --> 1:30:05.416
Last time I used a firearm?

1:30:05.708 --> 1:30:07.458
At a training, in 1992.

1:30:08.916 --> 1:30:11.916
My brother joined the force too,

1:30:12.000 --> 1:30:16.416
but he said, "Fuck it",
and opened a repair garage.

1:30:16.500 --> 1:30:20.125
Good thing, 'cause I can fix the car.
At my expense.

1:30:21.416 --> 1:30:23.333
I keep applying for a new one.

1:30:24.208 --> 1:30:25.166
Nothing.

1:30:28.166 --> 1:30:30.125
And that's how I serve the force.

1:30:31.125 --> 1:30:34.875
The fucking life runs through my fingers
day in and day out.

1:30:35.750 --> 1:30:37.750
And I achieved nothing.

1:30:58.708 --> 1:30:59.625
Right.

1:31:01.958 --> 1:31:04.333
So… I'll be going, hon.

1:31:18.291 --> 1:31:19.416
See you on Tuesday.

1:31:20.750 --> 1:31:21.916
Thank you, sweetie.

1:31:28.916 --> 1:31:30.083
Two thirty seven?

1:31:33.666 --> 1:31:35.041
Two thirty seven, over.

1:31:36.791 --> 1:31:40.666
Keep your eyes peeled
for Mariusz and his brother.

1:31:40.750 --> 1:31:43.583
Someone saw them
in World War II uniforms

1:31:43.666 --> 1:31:46.166
celebrating Hitler's birthday
in the woods.

1:32:07.083 --> 1:32:08.166
-God!
-Help!

1:32:08.916 --> 1:32:09.791
Help me!

1:32:10.250 --> 1:32:12.666
-Please help!
-Child…

1:32:12.750 --> 1:32:15.458
What happened? What's wrong?

1:32:16.208 --> 1:32:17.083
Are you hurt?

1:32:55.958 --> 1:32:56.833
Shit!

1:33:03.166 --> 1:33:04.375
I'll be right back.

1:33:27.166 --> 1:33:28.041
Officer!

1:33:39.916 --> 1:33:40.750
Mister?

1:33:42.666 --> 1:33:43.750
Are you alright?

1:33:46.333 --> 1:33:47.250
Officer!

1:34:00.625 --> 1:34:02.000
Son of a bitch!

1:34:02.416 --> 1:34:04.458
Drop it! Police!

1:34:40.541 --> 1:34:41.541
Fuck!

1:36:40.958 --> 1:36:42.125
The anthem.

1:36:44.333 --> 1:36:45.416
How does it start?

1:36:47.416 --> 1:36:50.958
Golden rays glow all around us

1:36:51.541 --> 1:36:54.625
The white eagle upward goes

1:36:55.541 --> 1:36:59.083
Let us raise our heads in pride

1:36:59.750 --> 1:37:02.791
See the emblem, see the cross!

1:37:03.750 --> 1:37:07.166
We shall build a brand new Poland…

1:37:07.708 --> 1:37:09.416
Wait, here's the tricky part.

1:37:12.083 --> 1:37:13.708
-We're...
-Well?

1:37:14.000 --> 1:37:17.375
-We're the future, we're the hup!
-The "hub".

1:37:17.875 --> 1:37:18.791
"Hub".

1:37:20.458 --> 1:37:23.333
God, honor, and fatherland!

1:37:23.625 --> 1:37:26.708
God, honor and fatherland!

1:37:27.750 --> 1:37:29.916
-I hear you.
-I love Poland.

1:37:42.500 --> 1:37:43.333
Hey.

1:37:45.083 --> 1:37:45.916
A boar?

1:37:46.875 --> 1:37:48.083
A boar. Light it up.
