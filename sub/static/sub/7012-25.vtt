WEBVTT

00:04.240 --> 00:06.920
Okay, boys.
I brought cheese samples from work.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.880
What's wrong with them?

00:08.960 --> 00:12.640
Nothing. Well,
they were in the trash.

00:12.720 --> 00:16.160
- Cool.
- Hand it over.

00:16.239 --> 00:19.080
Hey. You know how my brother
locks me in the closet...

00:19.160 --> 00:21.640
with a pillowcase full of dead fish
until the stink makes me cry?

00:23.880 --> 00:27.040
Well, while I was in there,
I heard him make a phone call.

00:27.120 --> 00:30.880
And it seems that he's got a
little surprise for Donna tonight...

00:30.960 --> 00:34.640
the honeymoon suite
at that French motel in Kenosha.

00:34.680 --> 00:37.080
The Le Motel?

00:37.160 --> 00:41.640
Oh, no, it sounds like Donna
and Casey are going to <i>le</i> do it.

00:43.880 --> 00:47.440
Oh, yeah. Eric's gonna freak out
when we tell him.

00:47.520 --> 00:51.360
- And why would we tell him?
- To watch him freak out.

00:51.440 --> 00:54.480
Kelso, he's gonna take it
really hard, man.

00:54.560 --> 00:57.240
- So we just need to keep our mouths shut.
- Wow.

00:57.320 --> 01:01.560
That's very considerate of Eric's feelings.
What the hell, man?

01:03.440 --> 01:06.000
I just think we all need to zip it,
especially you.

01:06.080 --> 01:09.400
Hey, I can keep a secret.

01:09.480 --> 01:11.880
I didn't tell Kelso you took
five bucks from his wallet.

01:15.840 --> 01:17.680
Hyde!

01:17.760 --> 01:20.160
None of you guys
can keep a secret.

01:20.240 --> 01:23.840
Well, you sure can, especially when
it's about you kissing other guys.

01:23.920 --> 01:29.040
Michael, it was one guy from work,
and I told you I'm sorry.

01:29.120 --> 01:31.320
God, how long are you gonna
keep throwing that in my face?

01:31.400 --> 01:34.440
Well, how long are you gonna keep
throwing your face in other guys' faces?

01:39.080 --> 01:41.440
Wow. That was clever.

01:44.200 --> 01:46.040
I think I won that!
Yeah!

01:48.000 --> 01:54.074

01:55.520 --> 01:57.360
Oh, Eric.

01:57.440 --> 01:59.880
Let me just say I'm sorry.

02:03.440 --> 02:06.080
- For what?
- I can't tell you.

02:09.840 --> 02:13.120
But if you were to guess that Casey
is taking Donna to a honeymoon suite...

02:13.200 --> 02:15.440
I'd say, "Good guess."

02:17.520 --> 02:20.560
Wait. Casey and Donna
got a motel room?

02:20.640 --> 02:23.600
Yeah, but look at the bright side.
Donna and Casey may be doing it...

02:23.680 --> 02:26.840
but at least they're doing it
on a vibrating, heart-shaped bed.

02:29.960 --> 02:32.520
If you see what I mean.

02:36.320 --> 02:39.800
Well, I do now thanks to your spot-on,
detailed description.

02:39.880 --> 02:42.480
Oh, and there'll probably
be a mirror too.

02:42.560 --> 02:44.840
Okay, thanks, Fez.

02:44.880 --> 02:47.480
- You know, so they can watch each other.
- Yeah, I know.

02:50.960 --> 02:53.000
I'd like to propose a toast.

02:53.080 --> 02:56.400
My divorce papers
finally came through.

02:56.440 --> 03:00.040
- To divorce!
- Oh, no, no. No, no.

03:00.120 --> 03:04.040
If you're gonna drink to divorce, drink
alone in the dark like regular sad people.

03:04.080 --> 03:06.840
I'm not sad.
I'm happy...

03:06.920 --> 03:11.400
'cause now I can do all kinds of things
I couldn't do before, like, uh...

03:11.440 --> 03:13.320
Joanne, we could get married.

03:29.600 --> 03:31.760
Somethin' funny?

03:31.840 --> 03:34.400
Bob, we've never
mentioned marriage before.

03:34.480 --> 03:36.800
You spring it on me now
in front of strangers?

03:36.880 --> 03:38.920
Oh, excuse me.

03:38.960 --> 03:40.960
My mistake, I guess.

03:44.560 --> 03:47.560
I guess I hurt
someone's feelings.

03:47.640 --> 03:51.760
Well, you certainly did.
We are not strangers!

03:57.520 --> 04:00.040
So, what are you and Casey
doin' tonight?

04:00.080 --> 04:03.640
He won't tell me.
It's a surprise.

04:03.720 --> 04:07.000
Oh, honey, it's blush,
not spray paint.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.640
A surprise, huh?

04:16.720 --> 04:19.839
What if the surprise is something big?
Are you ready for it?

04:19.920 --> 04:22.400
I mean, how do you really
feel about Casey?

04:22.480 --> 04:24.840
I don't know.

04:24.920 --> 04:28.200
Well, how do you feel
about his hair?

04:28.240 --> 04:31.120
Love it.
Lots of body.

04:31.200 --> 04:34.320
- And his body?
- Love it. Lots of hair.

04:39.160 --> 04:42.680
- How about his car?
- I love it. Trans Ams kick ass.

04:44.120 --> 04:46.000
So hair, body and car.
The big three...

04:46.040 --> 04:48.400
the Holy Trinity of Love.

04:51.400 --> 04:54.760
Okay, I think you're ready
for your big surprise.

04:54.840 --> 04:56.960
Jackie, what is
this big surprise?

04:57.040 --> 05:00.640
All I can tell you
is definitely...

05:00.720 --> 05:02.920
<i>definitely</i> shave those legs.

05:07.600 --> 05:09.800
Well, I called the Le Motel.

05:09.880 --> 05:14.000
Fez, you were right.
Casey has a reservation for tonight.

05:14.080 --> 05:17.000
And, Hyde, you were right.
I cannot keep a secret.

05:18.480 --> 05:23.120
Speaking of secrets,
look what I found in Jackie's cheese.

05:23.160 --> 05:25.840
Some guy Phil's
phone number.

05:25.920 --> 05:30.840
I-I can't take this anymore. I just know
it, Hyde. She's cheatin' on me again.

05:30.920 --> 05:33.720
Kelso, don't jump
to conclusions.

05:33.800 --> 05:36.200
Maybe I don't care.

05:36.240 --> 05:38.680
Forman, man, you gotta be cool
about this Donna thing...

05:38.760 --> 05:40.680
or she's gonna know
you're jealous.

05:40.720 --> 05:45.480
You can't be all
Simon and Garfunkely.

05:45.560 --> 05:48.680
You gotta get
Bruce Springsteeny.

05:48.760 --> 05:53.240
Springsteenian.
Springsteenicious.

05:53.320 --> 05:55.520
Wait. What are we
talking about?

05:55.600 --> 05:59.000
Whoa. Hey, you guys,
I'm not jealous.

05:59.080 --> 06:00.920
I'm just looking out for her.

06:01.000 --> 06:05.080
I mean, Donna's
practically a sister to me.

06:05.160 --> 06:08.480
A tall, shapely sister...

06:08.560 --> 06:11.120
who I've done it with...

06:11.200 --> 06:14.120
about a million times.

06:14.200 --> 06:17.720
Look, maybe Donna and Casey
won't even do it tonight.

06:17.800 --> 06:20.840
I'd call it 50-50.

06:20.920 --> 06:22.800
You would?

06:22.840 --> 06:25.440
Oh, I'd be wrong.

06:25.520 --> 06:28.600
But I'd call it that to keep you
from doing somethin' stupid.

06:29.920 --> 06:33.320
Forman, you gotta
do somethin' stupid.

06:33.360 --> 06:36.840
Sittin' around feeling helpless all day...
That isn't healthy.

06:36.920 --> 06:40.200
That's why I'm gonna
stalk Jackie.

06:40.240 --> 06:44.120
You know, I really love
things with holes.

06:44.200 --> 06:48.200
Swiss cheese, doughnuts,
inner tubes.

06:48.280 --> 06:51.120
I don't know what it is about a hole.
It just feels good.

07:00.560 --> 07:03.160
Hello?

07:03.240 --> 07:05.160
Is Phil there?

07:07.680 --> 07:12.080
- Who?
- Phil! Some guy you kissed!

07:12.160 --> 07:16.240
I found his number
in your cheese!

07:16.320 --> 07:19.240
Michael, Phil's the guy
who delivers the sausage.

07:24.360 --> 07:26.280
You tramp!

07:27.520 --> 07:30.520
No, idiot.
He brings food to our store.

07:30.600 --> 07:32.600
He's our sausage guy.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.840
Tramp!

07:37.960 --> 07:41.480
Wait... Who's that singing?
Who's singing love songs to you?

07:42.800 --> 07:45.160
Peter Frampton.

07:45.240 --> 07:47.280
Are you kissing him?

07:50.120 --> 07:52.920
No!

07:53.000 --> 07:56.160
Are you sure?

08:00.560 --> 08:04.720
Hello?

08:04.800 --> 08:08.560
Hello, this is Norman.
Shall we kiss?

08:16.640 --> 08:20.160
Okay, Red, what Bob needs
right now is a good friend.

08:20.240 --> 08:24.960
And since I don't know where we're
gonna find one, you need to talk to him.

08:25.040 --> 08:28.200
- Kitty...
- Or you can talk to Joanne.

08:28.280 --> 08:30.360
I'll take Bob.

08:38.480 --> 08:40.480
I'll take Joanne.

08:45.320 --> 08:47.400
Donna, I have to
talk to you!

08:53.640 --> 08:55.640
Leo?

08:55.720 --> 08:57.720
Have you got Donna in there?

08:59.320 --> 09:01.200
You know,
I didn't think to ask.

09:03.280 --> 09:05.200
Look, I have to find Donna.

09:05.280 --> 09:07.880
Casey's gonna surprise her with
the honeymoon suite. And I know Donna.

09:07.920 --> 09:09.840
She's not gonna like
that kind of surprise.

09:09.920 --> 09:15.240
So she'll probably be looking for an out,
so I'm here to rescue her.

09:15.280 --> 09:19.560
Kind of like Luke did
with Leia in <i>Star Wars.</i>

09:19.600 --> 09:22.920
You know,
"I'm here to rescue you!"

09:25.280 --> 09:28.000
The other honeymoon suite's
across the hall, man.

09:28.080 --> 09:32.080
Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got
a game of Twister I gotta stretch for.

09:38.760 --> 09:42.320
<i>Casey, check it out. They have tiny soaps.</i>

09:46.760 --> 09:48.680
What am I doing?

10:01.640 --> 10:04.360
I couldn't do it, Leo.
Donna's havin' a good time.

10:04.400 --> 10:07.160
She doesn't wanna be rescued.
But you know what?

10:07.240 --> 10:11.240
The thing is, I still wanna go
in there and stop everything, you know?

10:11.280 --> 10:13.760
I didn't come here for her.
I came here for me.

10:13.840 --> 10:17.160
That's a huge dilemma, man.

10:17.240 --> 10:19.880
But you know what you
really gotta ask yourself?

10:19.960 --> 10:24.600
Is there anybody who's not in a motel room
with three women that you could tell this to?

10:40.720 --> 10:42.920
Okay, here's the thing.

10:42.960 --> 10:46.200
Bob really likes you.

10:46.280 --> 10:49.800
Why? Who knows?

10:54.160 --> 10:58.960
But that's America. Any kook can have
any damn fool idea he wants.

11:01.640 --> 11:04.400
Look, I haven't had
good luck with marriage.

11:04.480 --> 11:07.200
When my first husband
and I were dating, he was great.

11:07.280 --> 11:10.280
But as soon as I married him,
he turned into...

11:10.320 --> 11:12.520
well, something like you.

11:14.320 --> 11:18.800
Well, I don't know what kind of crap
your ex-husband used to pull...

11:18.880 --> 11:21.960
but whatever it was,
Bob doesn't have it in him.

11:22.040 --> 11:25.480
He's just a nice,
loyal guy...

11:25.560 --> 11:28.480
with a big heart.

11:28.560 --> 11:31.720
He's perfect for
a pushy gal like you.

11:37.160 --> 11:39.240
Well, he does have
a big heart.

11:39.320 --> 11:42.760
And we do
go well together.

11:42.800 --> 11:46.600
You know, Red, if I didn't know any better,
I'd think you were a good guy.

11:46.640 --> 11:50.680
Well, if I didn't know any better,
I'd think I cared.

11:56.080 --> 11:58.560
The red cheese is chewy.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.920
The red cheese is wax.

12:17.280 --> 12:20.520
Oh. Hey, guess what, fellas?

12:20.560 --> 12:23.080
Turns out I still have
feelings for Donna. Yeah.

12:24.400 --> 12:28.840
Deep feelings.
Warm feelings.

12:28.920 --> 12:31.200
Tingly-in-the-pants feelings.

12:35.360 --> 12:38.160
And I can't do anything
about it, because...

12:38.240 --> 12:41.680
she has those feelings
for someone else.

12:41.760 --> 12:46.000
I think that admitting that
you still love Donna...

12:46.080 --> 12:48.000
is an important step...

12:48.080 --> 12:50.160
because it reopens
the door for this:

12:50.240 --> 12:54.320
Eric loves Donna! Eric loves Donna!

13:00.720 --> 13:03.520
Look, you guys,
I don't love her.

13:03.600 --> 13:05.600
I just think that
if she's not with me...

13:05.680 --> 13:09.520
the fairest thing for everyone
is if she's alone and unhappy.

13:11.280 --> 13:13.840
No!
That is a bad plan, man.

13:13.920 --> 13:16.640
'Cause if you leave a chick alone,
the next thing you know...

13:16.720 --> 13:19.000
she's lickin' the roof
of some other guy's mouth.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.920
Like the cheese guy.
I hate that guy!

13:26.160 --> 13:28.920
But you love his cheese.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.720
See, this is just like
a Southern tragedy.

13:31.800 --> 13:34.760
Tennessee Williams,
but with cheese.

13:37.200 --> 13:39.400
I'm taking advanced English.

13:40.960 --> 13:44.280
Oh, man, I gotta go to the mall.
I'm late to stalk Jackie.

13:49.240 --> 13:51.480
I just...

13:51.560 --> 13:54.640
I can't believe Donna's in a motel room
with him right now.

13:54.720 --> 13:58.000
Man, I don't like it either.

13:58.080 --> 14:00.800
But there is one thing
you can do.

14:00.880 --> 14:04.000
I believe you have a stack of <i>Playboys</i>
underneath your bed.

14:07.760 --> 14:09.600
Go use 'em.

14:12.160 --> 14:15.440
Okay, Bob, I think
the problem is that...

14:15.520 --> 14:18.320
Joanne thinks you're moving
just a little too fast.

14:18.400 --> 14:20.640
That's just who I am.

14:20.720 --> 14:22.880
I do everything fast.

14:24.400 --> 14:26.280
I run fast.

14:28.120 --> 14:30.680
I drive fast.

14:30.760 --> 14:32.640
I eat fast.

14:32.720 --> 14:34.760
Okay, what happens
when you eat fast?

14:35.800 --> 14:37.880
I get gassy.

14:40.560 --> 14:45.040
Right. Okay, well, a relationship
works the same way.

14:45.120 --> 14:49.640
When it grows too fast,
it... it gets gassy too.

14:51.160 --> 14:54.440
And-And... And then
the bad thing happens...

14:54.480 --> 14:56.880
and people
leave the room.

15:01.520 --> 15:03.840
Wow.

15:03.920 --> 15:06.840
A lot of people
have told me to slow down...

15:06.920 --> 15:09.480
but nobody ever said it
in a way that spoke to me.

15:12.360 --> 15:14.880
- Hi, Bob.
- Hey, Joanne.

15:14.960 --> 15:16.800
Okay, well,
we'll just, um...

15:16.880 --> 15:19.080
We'll leave
you two alone.

15:23.720 --> 15:27.280
Okay, well, there will be no more
marriage talk from Bob.

15:27.360 --> 15:30.960
What? There'd better be.
She's expecting it!

15:31.040 --> 15:33.080
- Oh, crap!
- Lock the doors!

15:33.160 --> 15:35.040
I'm on it!

15:58.600 --> 16:00.440
Michael!

16:00.520 --> 16:03.560
What are you doing?

16:03.600 --> 16:07.720
- What, are you spying on me now?
- No!

16:10.320 --> 16:12.760
Okay, fine.
Yeah, I'm spying on you...

16:12.840 --> 16:15.040
'cause you're around
strange guys all day...

16:15.120 --> 16:18.440
and apparently, every once in a while,
you up and French one of 'em.

16:18.520 --> 16:22.880
Michael, go home.
This is a place of business.

16:22.960 --> 16:26.040
And if you don't have any business,
you're not welcome at the mall.

16:27.280 --> 16:29.160
Fine!

16:34.480 --> 16:37.560
Stay away
from my girlfriend!

16:38.600 --> 16:40.440
Michael, what are you doing?

16:40.520 --> 16:44.040
Well, I can be at the mall now,
'cause I got business. Train business.

16:44.120 --> 16:46.560
You have lost your mind!

16:46.640 --> 16:49.560
Yep, and I don't miss it!

16:49.640 --> 16:53.800
Michael, look at you, riding around
on a kiddie train so you can spy on me.

16:53.880 --> 16:55.960
I mean, do you not see
how crazy this is?

16:58.960 --> 17:00.880
Well, yeah.

17:00.960 --> 17:03.520
But I-I don't know
what to do.

17:03.600 --> 17:07.280
I mean, I'm a mess.
I can't sleep, I can't eat.

17:07.359 --> 17:11.520
Well, I can eat. And then when I eat,
I get kind of sleepy.

17:11.599 --> 17:13.440
But I am really upset!

17:13.520 --> 17:17.240
Look, if we're ever gonna get past this, you
have to forget about that stupid little kiss...

17:17.319 --> 17:21.000
and just try... <i>try</i> to remember
that we love each other.

17:21.040 --> 17:25.160
- I know.
- So can we please, please just finally move on?

17:26.280 --> 17:28.760
I wanna say yes, but...

17:28.840 --> 17:31.960
it's like we're
on this track...

17:32.040 --> 17:35.720
and we keep going around
in circles like some kind of...

17:37.640 --> 17:39.720
some kind of...

17:42.480 --> 17:45.600
I don't know.
I lost my train of thought.

17:47.440 --> 17:50.760
Okay, Forman, what were you doing
at the Le Motel last night?

17:50.840 --> 17:53.640
And don't say you weren't there,
because Leo saw you.

17:53.680 --> 17:57.480
Wait, wait.
Leo thinks he saw me at the Le Motel?

17:58.920 --> 18:01.520
Cut the crap, Eric.

18:01.600 --> 18:03.840
You know Casey and I
had a room last night...

18:03.920 --> 18:07.680
so you went there and you pulled
the fire alarm all night until we left.

18:09.520 --> 18:12.120
Fire alarm?
I didn't... I didn't pull...

18:13.800 --> 18:16.280
Wait. You guys left?
So you guys didn't...

18:16.360 --> 18:18.800
No! We spent all night
in the parking lot...

18:18.880 --> 18:21.120
with Leo and
his hooty mamas.

18:23.920 --> 18:27.720
Eric, what were you
even doing at the motel?

18:30.280 --> 18:32.160
I don't know. I just...

18:34.480 --> 18:39.760
I was fine, right? I mean,
we were friends, and that was cool.

18:39.840 --> 18:42.960
And now, Donna,
all of a sudden...

18:43.040 --> 18:48.240
it's like the day after
we broke up all over again, and...

18:48.320 --> 18:52.120
Look, I'm sorry, but when I knew
you were gonna be with Casey, I just...

18:52.200 --> 18:54.280
I felt...

18:58.320 --> 19:00.200
Whatever.

19:01.760 --> 19:04.840
No, I get it.

19:04.920 --> 19:08.880
Remember when you wanted to date
other people, and I was so cool about it?

19:08.960 --> 19:13.640
Well, I wasn't.
It, like, broke my heart.

19:15.160 --> 19:18.000
- So what did you do?
- Well, I didn't know what to do.

19:18.080 --> 19:23.080
- So, I just, you know...
- Right.

19:23.120 --> 19:26.400
Casey.

19:26.480 --> 19:28.960
Right.

19:29.040 --> 19:32.480
Hey, look, from now on,
I'm gonna stay out of your business.

19:32.560 --> 19:35.680
- I promise.
- Thank you.

19:35.760 --> 19:37.680
But before that promise
goes into effect...

19:37.760 --> 19:42.240
I would like it duly noted for the record
that I think Casey's all wrong for you...

19:42.320 --> 19:46.360
and I think you guys
are moving way too fast.

19:46.440 --> 19:49.280
Duly noted.

19:49.360 --> 19:52.200
- And I'll stay out of your business too.
- Okay.

19:52.240 --> 19:57.960
Good. So I better, uh,
drum me up some business, huh?

20:14.340 --> 20:16.220
Still sleepin', huh?
Gosh.

20:16.300 --> 20:18.700
Pulling fire alarms all night
must really wear you out.

20:18.780 --> 20:22.020
That's right.
I'm on to you, buddy.

20:22.100 --> 20:24.980
You did a nice thing,
and I'm tellin' everybody.

20:25.060 --> 20:28.100
Oh, man, I didn't do it
to be nice.

20:28.140 --> 20:30.820
I did it because I always wanted
to commit a felony.

20:30.900 --> 20:34.180
Misdemeanors just ain't
the rush they used to be.

20:34.220 --> 20:37.420
Well, all I hear is...

20:37.500 --> 20:40.500
"I love you,
I love you, I love you."
