WEBVTT

00:12.229 --> 00:14.057
I've started up
a security firm.

00:14.101 --> 00:15.580
You are way too softhearted

00:15.624 --> 00:16.799
to be a businessman.

00:16.842 --> 00:18.453
You'll be eaten up.

00:18.496 --> 00:20.194
...go!
Take ahold
of yourself.

00:21.804 --> 00:24.067
I am so sorry. If you have
any medical expenses,

00:24.111 --> 00:25.460
call me.
My card.

00:25.503 --> 00:27.070
Pennyworth Security.

00:27.114 --> 00:28.724
PRIME MINISTER:
Fucking Raven Society.

00:28.767 --> 00:30.595
They're lunatics.

00:30.639 --> 00:32.162
Want to overthrow
the government and set up

00:32.206 --> 00:33.511
a fascist utopia.

00:33.555 --> 00:35.731
Dark wheels are turning.

00:35.774 --> 00:38.386
HARWOOD:
This great nation of ours

00:38.429 --> 00:41.519
is at war with itself.
Who did you talk to?

00:41.563 --> 00:43.391
Give me the name.

00:43.434 --> 00:46.176
Thomas Wayne.

00:58.275 --> 01:00.060
ESME:
You were in the army?

01:00.103 --> 01:01.713
Ten years.

01:01.757 --> 01:03.063
Didn't it bother you?

01:04.151 --> 01:05.804
Still does.

01:05.848 --> 01:07.371
Sit down, Spanish.

01:11.941 --> 01:13.421
Help me!

01:16.076 --> 01:18.513
Call us when you've got
Thomas Wayne. We'll do a swap.

01:19.905 --> 01:21.472
I have him.

01:21.516 --> 01:23.126
Smashing.

01:23.170 --> 01:24.867
If they kill me,

01:24.910 --> 01:25.911
they have to kill you.

01:29.959 --> 01:31.874
One of you is taking
us to Esme sharpish.

01:31.917 --> 01:33.049
Harwood House.

01:34.268 --> 01:36.313
All of them are wearing these.

01:36.357 --> 01:39.142
The Raven Society.

01:39.186 --> 01:42.363
We will take back this country
from the corrupt weaklings.

01:42.406 --> 01:43.538
We'll need men like you.

01:49.718 --> 01:51.937
Think about what
you're doing, Alfred.

01:51.981 --> 01:53.548
Turn away.

01:55.289 --> 01:57.943
I'll be back.

01:57.987 --> 01:59.119
I'll be back!

03:12.757 --> 03:15.369
Look at me.

03:19.938 --> 03:22.811
Mr. Ripper, please.

Mr. Wayne.

04:55.469 --> 04:57.035
Thomas.

04:57.079 --> 04:59.211
Please.
Your sister's
not here, Thomas.

04:59.255 --> 05:01.126
No, she's safe
at home with Mother,

05:01.170 --> 05:02.998
I'm glad to say.
I came to see you.

05:03.041 --> 05:04.216
Oh.

05:04.260 --> 05:05.740
How's Esme?

05:05.783 --> 05:07.698
What is this about?

05:07.742 --> 05:10.353
Succinct as ever.

05:10.397 --> 05:13.356
I told you that I might need
your services some day.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.924
Well, today's the day.

05:15.967 --> 05:17.882
I have a job for you,

05:17.926 --> 05:19.057
if you're interested.

05:19.101 --> 05:20.276
I'm very busy at the minute.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.712
I see that.

05:21.756 --> 05:25.063
I'll take bouncing drunks
over secret wars any day.

05:25.107 --> 05:27.675
Well, the job I have in mind is
utterly aboveboard and lawful.

05:27.718 --> 05:29.677
Honorable, even.

05:29.720 --> 05:31.635
Hmm.And the pay is excellent.

05:31.679 --> 05:33.811
Would you like
to hear the details?

05:33.855 --> 05:36.248
No, I wouldn't.

05:36.292 --> 05:38.468
It's not that I don't
trust you, Mr. Wayne.

05:38.512 --> 05:40.775
But my girlfriend nearly died

05:40.818 --> 05:43.168
because of the
company you keep.

05:43.212 --> 05:45.432
I had to kill people.

05:50.567 --> 05:52.613
All's well
that ends well, though.

05:52.656 --> 05:54.789
You'd be doing your country

05:54.832 --> 05:56.617
a great service.

05:56.660 --> 05:59.315
I've been serving them
since I was 16.

05:59.359 --> 06:01.796
I'm serving myself now.

06:09.151 --> 06:10.544
One name

06:10.587 --> 06:14.199
and the pain will stop,
my dear.

06:14.243 --> 06:18.508
Who is the leader
of the Raven Society?

06:21.119 --> 06:22.512
Tea's up.

06:22.556 --> 06:24.949
Ooh, lovely.

06:24.993 --> 06:26.951
I'm gasping.
Put it on the table.

06:28.997 --> 06:32.479
Who is the leader

06:32.522 --> 06:35.307
of the Raven Society?

06:35.351 --> 06:38.702
Fuck off.

06:57.068 --> 06:58.940
Evening, miss.

07:01.072 --> 07:03.597
What's in the butties?Fish paste.

07:03.640 --> 07:07.427
I don't like fish paste.

07:07.470 --> 07:10.342
I've no mirror.

07:10.386 --> 07:12.649
How do I look?Good enough.

07:14.172 --> 07:16.348
I want to look me best
on the day.

07:16.392 --> 07:19.047
Not being snide, you'll
have a bag over your head.

07:19.090 --> 07:21.484
Not up there, I won't.

07:21.528 --> 07:24.618
Oh. Is that where you're going?

07:24.661 --> 07:27.577
I've done nowt. I'm innocent.

07:27.621 --> 07:28.926
Maybe you are,
and maybe you're not.

07:28.970 --> 07:30.972
Not my purview, miss.

07:31.015 --> 07:33.365
Any road...

07:33.409 --> 07:36.934
thanks for talking to me, pet.

07:36.978 --> 07:39.589
Gets boring, waiting to die.

07:39.633 --> 07:40.982
Can I ask you a favor?

07:41.025 --> 07:43.288
Not allowed. You know that.

07:43.332 --> 07:45.465
Nothing bad.

07:45.508 --> 07:47.597
I just want you to hold me hand.

07:48.903 --> 07:51.122
Give over.Only for a minute.

07:51.166 --> 07:53.473
You can touch me, can't you?
Course you can.

07:53.516 --> 07:56.476
What if you have to search me
for weapons?

07:56.519 --> 07:58.390
Have you got weapons?

07:59.522 --> 08:01.481
No.

08:01.524 --> 08:03.439
I've got no weapons.

08:05.049 --> 08:07.008
I just want someone kind

08:07.051 --> 08:08.749
to hold me hand

08:08.792 --> 08:10.707
before hangman does.

08:27.811 --> 08:30.031
Take cover.

08:37.821 --> 08:40.215
Penny for your thoughts?

08:45.873 --> 08:48.223
You look troubled.

08:50.878 --> 08:53.837
I was thinking I'd
put the kettle on.

09:05.109 --> 09:07.677
Lapsang sou... What?
Where's the proper tea?

09:09.505 --> 09:11.202
Where you left it.

09:13.074 --> 09:14.771
What time's the do?

09:14.815 --> 09:16.730
Curtain's up at 7:00.

09:16.773 --> 09:18.166
Nervous?

09:18.209 --> 09:19.820
Shattered.

09:19.863 --> 09:21.822
I dreamt of Bet Sykes all night.

09:21.865 --> 09:23.998
I dreamt
that she was waiting for me

09:24.041 --> 09:26.174
at my bus stop on Goodge Street.

09:26.217 --> 09:29.351
Hey. She's in Newgate
or the Tower,

09:29.394 --> 09:30.526
and she'll stay there,

09:30.570 --> 09:31.788
don't you worry.

09:31.832 --> 09:32.963
They won't let that one out.

09:34.748 --> 09:36.706
So, go on. Give us
some of your acting.

09:36.750 --> 09:38.708
Do "you're blind,
Johnny." That bit.

09:39.840 --> 09:41.668
You're blind, Johnny, blind.

09:41.711 --> 09:43.365
You can't see me. Me,

09:43.408 --> 09:44.845
damn you.

09:44.888 --> 09:46.194
It still makes me shiver.

09:49.023 --> 09:51.503
You'll be on the
telly in no time.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.637
You are sad.

09:56.813 --> 10:00.512
Look, just so you know,

10:00.556 --> 10:02.863
when you're a famous actress
and that, I won't hold you back.

10:02.906 --> 10:04.691
Hold me back?

10:04.734 --> 10:06.649
From better prospects.

10:06.693 --> 10:08.564
What, like other men?

10:09.696 --> 10:11.393
Whatever you have to do.

10:11.436 --> 10:13.003
I won't hold you back.

10:14.570 --> 10:16.441
Are you trying to leave me?

10:17.573 --> 10:19.619
Look, I won't lie to you.

10:19.662 --> 10:21.229
If business doesn't pick up,

10:21.272 --> 10:22.883
I'm not gonna drag
you down with me.

10:22.926 --> 10:24.406
You've always been
so optimistic.

10:24.449 --> 10:26.016
Be honest. You're
not gonna be happy

10:26.060 --> 10:27.670
in some council flat in Poplar.

10:27.714 --> 10:29.890
You need a house in Chelsea,
meals in restaurants.

10:29.933 --> 10:32.153
Lobsters, steak. I can't
give you any of that.

10:32.196 --> 10:33.589
You are trying to leave me.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.373
I'm trying to be realistic.

10:35.417 --> 10:36.810
Well, bugger realistic.

10:36.853 --> 10:39.203
We love each other.
That's all that matters.

10:39.247 --> 10:40.857
Well, then, why haven't
I met your old man yet?

10:44.687 --> 10:46.820
'Cause he's bloody tedious.

10:46.863 --> 10:48.169
That's why.

10:56.264 --> 10:58.745
Besides, I'm...

10:58.788 --> 11:01.225
I'm waiting for the right time.

11:02.705 --> 11:04.533
Yeah.

11:06.709 --> 11:09.146
Look, I've got to go.

11:09.190 --> 11:10.713
Ah, good luck.

11:10.757 --> 11:12.236
Actors don't say "good luck."

11:12.280 --> 11:13.716
We say "break a leg."

11:13.760 --> 11:17.807
Well... break a leg, then.

11:26.033 --> 11:27.991
ALFRED:
Well, what did Fat Colin say?

11:28.035 --> 11:29.819
Oh, aye.

11:29.863 --> 11:31.908
He said no.

11:31.952 --> 11:34.868
You said he said
he definitely needed security.

11:34.911 --> 11:37.871
Aye. That was before the
heathen twat barred me.

11:37.914 --> 11:39.089
Oh.

11:39.133 --> 11:41.701
Don't lose faith, Alfie.

11:41.744 --> 11:43.572
You're gonna be a big man.

11:43.615 --> 11:45.356
I know it.

11:45.400 --> 11:47.184
All right, lads? Same again?Mate.

11:47.228 --> 11:48.751
Yeah, why not.I'll bring them over.

11:48.795 --> 11:50.710
Ah, thanks.Cheers.

12:00.197 --> 12:02.156
All right, Jason?

12:02.199 --> 12:03.461
Usual?

12:03.505 --> 12:05.246
Where's my girl? Sandra.

12:05.289 --> 12:06.856
BARTENDER:
Oh, she's about.

12:06.900 --> 12:08.684
Pint of best?

12:08.728 --> 12:10.773
I'll wait for Sandra.

12:10.817 --> 12:12.819
She pulls a better pint.

12:12.862 --> 12:14.908
Know what I mean?Yeah.

12:14.951 --> 12:16.692
Sandra!

12:24.744 --> 12:27.485
Pint of best, please, Sandra.

12:30.575 --> 12:33.056
Pulled nice and slow

12:33.100 --> 12:35.189
so I can watch you.

12:35.232 --> 12:37.365
BARTENDER:
Sorry, Jason.

12:37.408 --> 12:38.758
I'm all fingers today.

12:38.801 --> 12:40.368
Don't know what come over me.

12:47.854 --> 12:49.769
Are you sad?

12:50.857 --> 12:53.163
Has someone made you sad?

12:53.207 --> 12:54.686
No.

12:54.730 --> 12:58.168
If someone made you sad,
Sandra, I'd go mental.

13:00.301 --> 13:01.911
Just peaky.

13:03.391 --> 13:04.653
JASON:
You've got

13:04.696 --> 13:06.046
romantic trouble.

13:06.089 --> 13:07.395
Aye?

13:07.438 --> 13:09.049
Come on, who is he?

13:09.092 --> 13:13.880
I will cut him open.

13:16.056 --> 13:18.623
Honestly, Jason, I'm not sad.

13:18.667 --> 13:20.582
I'm happy.

13:22.976 --> 13:25.935
You are very beautiful
when you smile.

13:25.979 --> 13:28.198
Come closer.

13:28.242 --> 13:31.114
Come on.

13:31.158 --> 13:33.856
Come on. Come... closer.

13:38.556 --> 13:40.471
Everyone thinks
you're a good girl.

13:42.865 --> 13:44.780
But I know what you are.

13:56.487 --> 13:58.446
I'll see you soon...

13:58.489 --> 14:00.404
my love.

14:13.983 --> 14:16.203
Sid?

14:16.246 --> 14:18.509
Alfie.

14:18.553 --> 14:20.120
What was all that about?

14:22.470 --> 14:24.733
My Sandra's a good girl,
but she's young for her age.

14:24.776 --> 14:26.082
You know what I mean?

14:26.126 --> 14:28.476
That young man come
in the pub the other week.

14:28.519 --> 14:30.478
She smiled at him,
as she does.

14:30.521 --> 14:32.480
He just took it
the wrong way.

14:32.523 --> 14:34.438
Now he won't leave
the poor girl alone.

14:34.482 --> 14:36.092
And he's a right wrong'un.

14:36.136 --> 14:38.529
I mean, he's done
horrible things.

14:38.573 --> 14:40.705
Well, it's your pub.
Tell him to sod off.

14:40.749 --> 14:42.664
I would.
His name's Jason.

14:42.707 --> 14:45.710
His mum's sister's married
to the Man from Whitechapel.

14:45.754 --> 14:47.408
Ah.

14:49.540 --> 14:51.542
Who's the Man
from Whitechapel?

14:51.586 --> 14:53.414
We don't say his name.

14:53.457 --> 14:55.764
He's not a good man.

14:55.807 --> 14:57.418
No bother who he is.

14:57.461 --> 14:59.159
Pennyworth Security

14:59.202 --> 15:00.551
can sort you out.

15:00.595 --> 15:02.031
Can you, Alfie?

15:02.075 --> 15:03.946
Can I what?

15:03.990 --> 15:07.645
If you knew someone
who knew someone,

15:07.689 --> 15:09.647
you know, from a distance...

15:09.691 --> 15:11.998
You want to blot the man?All right,
keep your voice down.

15:12.041 --> 15:15.349
Just saying, I'll pay what
it costs, if you know someone.

15:15.392 --> 15:17.568
I don't know anybody like that.

15:17.612 --> 15:20.571
Well, if blotting's
a non-starter,

15:20.615 --> 15:22.965
let Alfie have a quiet
chat with the lad.

15:23.009 --> 15:24.445
A quiet chat?

15:24.488 --> 15:26.490
DAVEBOY:
You've not heard
Alfie blather?

15:26.534 --> 15:30.581
Birds out of trees,
knickers off nuns.

15:30.625 --> 15:31.974
Is that true, Alfie?

15:32.018 --> 15:33.933
No. He's exaggerating.

15:33.976 --> 15:36.065
Look, I'm desperate.

15:36.109 --> 15:37.762
If there's anything
you can do,

15:37.806 --> 15:39.155
I'll make it worth your while.

15:43.725 --> 15:45.945
I know she was
being too friendly.

15:45.988 --> 15:48.295
But she was bringing
in the punters, weren't she?

15:48.338 --> 15:50.297
The missus,
may she rest in peace,

15:50.340 --> 15:52.473
she would have put
a stop to it.

15:52.516 --> 15:54.823
But I never did.

15:54.866 --> 15:58.087
If something bad happens
to her now,

15:58.131 --> 16:00.046
I'll top meself.

16:08.054 --> 16:09.577
DAVEBOY:
What's the matter with you?

16:09.620 --> 16:11.492
Now that was a job.

16:11.535 --> 16:14.843
The Man from Whitechapel
runs the East End.

16:14.886 --> 16:17.977
You don't know what he does
to people who disrespect him.

16:18.020 --> 16:19.369
Who cares?

16:19.413 --> 16:20.980
I'm trying to build
a nice business,

16:21.023 --> 16:22.982
so I can settle
down and have kids.

16:23.025 --> 16:25.375
Suicide missions are
not part of the plan.

16:25.419 --> 16:28.335
Alfie, you have forgotten
who you are.

16:29.379 --> 16:32.339
You are SA fucking S.

16:32.382 --> 16:33.557
And now you're scared

16:33.601 --> 16:35.559
to say some cunt's name?

16:36.647 --> 16:40.086
Qui fucking Audet, Alfie.

16:41.870 --> 16:44.394
Qui fucking Audet.

16:56.232 --> 16:58.191
Snap!
Ooh!

16:58.234 --> 16:59.975
Too fast for me, George.

17:00.019 --> 17:03.500
A snap wizard, you are.

17:03.544 --> 17:06.329
Where's my winnings, then?

17:08.331 --> 17:10.203
I'm embarrassed now.

17:12.074 --> 17:13.945
Bet's a bet, Bet.

17:15.251 --> 17:17.210
Very droll.

17:17.253 --> 17:19.038
All right, then.

17:19.081 --> 17:22.041
Just the one, mind.

17:22.084 --> 17:24.043
And no hanky-panky.

17:29.135 --> 17:31.702
You've been a good friend
to me, George.

17:32.921 --> 17:35.054
I'm very grateful.Well,

17:35.097 --> 17:38.361
been nice getting to know you.

17:38.405 --> 17:40.537
Bless.

17:42.191 --> 17:44.367
Come here.

17:56.771 --> 17:58.729
JOHNNY:
Bite me, woman,

17:58.773 --> 18:01.254
stab me, but I beg of you, don't

18:01.297 --> 18:02.690
cry at me.

18:02.733 --> 18:04.822
Don't cry? Don't cry?

18:04.866 --> 18:06.433
Fuck you, Johnny.

18:06.476 --> 18:08.478
I would drown you
in my tears

18:08.522 --> 18:10.524
if I could.
I would kill you.

18:10.567 --> 18:13.004
You can't, my love.

18:13.048 --> 18:16.182
You can't kill a man twice.

18:16.225 --> 18:18.445
Who am I, damn it?!

18:18.488 --> 18:20.882
ESME:
Who are you? Who am I?!

18:20.925 --> 18:23.537
You don't love me.
You can't even see me!

18:23.580 --> 18:25.060
You're blind, Johnny!

18:25.104 --> 18:27.018
Blind.

18:30.370 --> 18:32.850
WOMAN:
Bravo!

18:35.157 --> 18:37.116
MAN:
Excellent!
MAN 2:
Bravo!

18:37.159 --> 18:38.421
MAN 3:
Bravo!

18:38.465 --> 18:40.728
MAN 4:
Well done!

18:51.913 --> 18:54.437
Was the play any good?

18:56.700 --> 18:58.876
I couldn't tell
you, Inspector.

18:58.920 --> 19:01.314
Esme was good.

19:01.357 --> 19:03.185
Theatre buff, are you?

19:03.229 --> 19:05.492
Frightfully secret police
of me, I know.

19:05.535 --> 19:08.973
I apologize, but, um,
I have a question for you.

19:09.017 --> 19:11.411
I answered a thousand questions
for your mob already.

19:11.454 --> 19:13.456
You can read my statement.I read it.

19:13.500 --> 19:15.110
Doubtless you noticed

19:15.154 --> 19:17.068
that one very obvious question
wasn't asked.

19:17.112 --> 19:20.115
They didn't ask if Lord Harwood
named any other conspirators.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.725
They didn't want to know.

19:21.769 --> 19:23.249
Not on the record.

19:23.292 --> 19:26.382
Off the record,
I dowant to know.

19:26.426 --> 19:28.254
Yeah, I want to
know something, too.

19:28.297 --> 19:29.907
What's happened
to Bet Sykes?

19:29.951 --> 19:31.474
We've had no word.

19:31.518 --> 19:32.954
I should hope not.

19:32.997 --> 19:34.651
She doesn't exist anymore,

19:34.695 --> 19:36.218
not officially.

19:36.262 --> 19:37.872
You don't need
to worry about her.

19:37.915 --> 19:39.787
Well, I am worried.

19:42.529 --> 19:45.009
She's hanging under a hood
for the Longbrass murder

19:45.053 --> 19:46.968
next bank holiday.

19:48.099 --> 19:49.753
Good to know.You don't.

19:49.797 --> 19:52.626
Hmm. Harwood
didn't name anybody.

19:52.669 --> 19:55.106
Of course.

19:55.150 --> 19:57.500
Not that stupid.

19:57.544 --> 19:59.720
Never mind.
Worth asking.

20:01.069 --> 20:04.072
Oh, uh, while I have
your ear, old chap.

20:04.115 --> 20:05.552
It's just possible

20:05.595 --> 20:08.816
that some rather shady people
may approach you.

20:08.859 --> 20:12.080
First contact will be
a damn nice fellow,

20:12.123 --> 20:13.734
probably somebody

20:13.777 --> 20:15.344
you know and trust.

20:15.388 --> 20:16.954
He'll come
with an attractive proposition.

20:16.998 --> 20:19.740
A noble and lucrative
proposition, you might think.

20:21.307 --> 20:23.047
If and when this fellow appears,

20:23.091 --> 20:25.136
perhaps you might let me know.

20:25.180 --> 20:27.313
I can tell you
some interesting things

20:27.356 --> 20:29.140
about the organization
he represents.

20:29.184 --> 20:31.969
Why don't you just tell me now?

20:32.013 --> 20:33.928
Have they approached you
already?

20:33.971 --> 20:36.235
No.

20:36.278 --> 20:38.846
If they don't approach you,

20:38.889 --> 20:41.240
I've told a civilian something

20:41.283 --> 20:42.241
he doesn't need to know.

20:42.284 --> 20:44.243
ESME:
Alfie!

20:44.286 --> 20:46.245
See you, Inspector.

20:46.288 --> 20:48.029
Break a leg.

20:48.072 --> 20:49.987
Hey, that was brilliant, Ez!

20:50.031 --> 20:52.163
Really good. You look
like a film star.

20:52.207 --> 20:53.556
Tosh. Truly, was it any good?

20:53.600 --> 20:56.255
There was people crying.
Blokes. I saw 'em.

20:56.298 --> 20:57.734
No.Yeah.

21:12.183 --> 21:14.621
Egg and cress all
right for you, is it?

21:14.664 --> 21:16.666
Smashing.

21:16.710 --> 21:18.668
Before you go...

21:20.931 --> 21:24.413
Be a love,
put stamps on 'em, pop 'em

21:24.457 --> 21:26.502
in a letter box for me.

21:26.546 --> 21:28.069
You know I can't do that.

21:28.112 --> 21:30.506
You can.
I can't.

21:30.550 --> 21:34.118
You can't fuck the prisoners,
but you've been doing that.

21:34.162 --> 21:36.164
That's different.
How?

21:36.207 --> 21:37.861
It's my word against
yours, isn't it?

21:39.515 --> 21:41.474
No, it's not.

21:41.517 --> 21:44.346
Happen doctors

21:44.390 --> 21:47.044
these days can tell
whose spunk is whose.

21:47.088 --> 21:49.220
True fact.

21:49.264 --> 21:50.787
Read it in the Sundays.

21:52.441 --> 21:54.400
Modern science, eh?

21:54.443 --> 21:56.402
Bloody amazing.

21:56.445 --> 21:58.229
Give me that.

21:58.273 --> 22:00.319
I've got more.

22:00.362 --> 22:03.017
Tub of spunk you are,
aren't you, George?

22:03.060 --> 22:05.324
Big fat sex fiend.

22:05.367 --> 22:08.196
I'll tell the warden
you sent me letters before.

22:08.239 --> 22:10.154
That's aiding a
traitor, that is.

22:10.198 --> 22:12.766
Rack and the gibbet for you.

22:12.809 --> 22:15.203
Oh, God. Please don't make...

22:15.246 --> 22:16.596
Shut up. Take 'em.

22:22.253 --> 22:24.343
First class stamps, mind.

22:43.405 --> 22:46.234
ESME:
I'm a naive art student
having a tempestuous affair

22:46.277 --> 22:48.105
with a brilliant,
angry young poet.

22:48.149 --> 22:49.759
I'm trying to break
through his alienation.

22:49.803 --> 22:51.544
MARY:
Oh, dear.

22:51.587 --> 22:53.372
But it turns out all right
in the end, does it?

22:53.415 --> 22:55.330
Oh, no. That would
be very bourgeois.

22:56.810 --> 22:58.551
Mary's teaching me
how to make bread.

22:58.594 --> 23:00.553
There's bread in
the corner shop.

23:00.596 --> 23:02.946
Making bread is the sort
of thing every young woman

23:02.990 --> 23:04.513
needs to know.

23:04.557 --> 23:06.515
If she were ever
to marry someone.

23:06.559 --> 23:08.430
What are you
doing tonight?

23:08.474 --> 23:10.301
Can you come to
the play again?Again?

23:11.477 --> 23:12.826
I'd love to.

23:12.869 --> 23:14.784
I mean, I'll try,
but I'm busy tonight.

23:14.828 --> 23:17.613
Oh.It's a job, actually.

23:17.657 --> 23:19.963
My first one.
First proper one.

23:20.007 --> 23:21.487
Oh, hooray! Hooray!

23:21.530 --> 23:24.054
Alfie, that's smashing.
What's the job?

23:24.098 --> 23:25.752
It's not dangerous, is it?

23:25.795 --> 23:28.058
No, no.

23:28.102 --> 23:30.147
No. Mediation.

23:30.191 --> 23:31.410
That's what we call it
in the trade.

23:31.453 --> 23:32.933
I'm so proud of you.

23:32.976 --> 23:34.587
ESME: See? Things
are looking up.

23:34.630 --> 23:36.458
Yeah, it's a start anyway.Well, if you can't

23:36.502 --> 23:38.808
come to the play, why don't you
come to the party afterward?

23:38.852 --> 23:40.462
It doesn't start
till 11:00.

23:40.506 --> 23:42.072
Frightfully glamorous.

23:42.116 --> 23:45.032
Hmm. I'll try.
Oh, come on.
It'll be a hoot.

23:45.075 --> 23:46.860
I'll try.

24:00.221 --> 24:02.179
Where's Sandra?

24:02.223 --> 24:03.877
Oh, she'll be along.

24:03.920 --> 24:05.966
Pint of best?

24:06.009 --> 24:07.707
Sandra!

24:11.319 --> 24:14.365
Ah. There you are.

24:20.415 --> 24:22.330
Pint of best,

24:22.373 --> 24:24.288
please, my dove.

24:27.509 --> 24:29.729
What? Not a word for me?

24:29.772 --> 24:31.861
Silence?

24:31.905 --> 24:33.820
Sorry.

24:33.863 --> 24:36.387
I was just thinking about
if the barrel needs changing.

24:38.520 --> 24:40.174
Are you scared of me, Sandra?

24:41.828 --> 24:43.786
I think you are,

24:43.830 --> 24:45.788
but that's all right.

24:45.832 --> 24:47.355
A little fear

24:47.398 --> 24:49.749
is very sexy.

24:49.792 --> 24:51.272
ALFRED:
All right, Sandra?

24:51.315 --> 24:53.317
Pint of best
when you're ready, love.

24:57.800 --> 24:59.715
What's your name?

25:00.847 --> 25:02.631
Alfred.

25:02.675 --> 25:04.677
Oh. I'm Jason.

25:04.720 --> 25:07.375
Jason Ripper.

25:07.418 --> 25:08.637
All right, mate.

25:08.681 --> 25:10.378
When's that pint
coming, love?

25:14.861 --> 25:17.341
Local boy, are you, Alfred?I am.

25:17.385 --> 25:19.082
But you don't know who I am?I do.

25:20.214 --> 25:21.563
You just told me.

25:21.607 --> 25:22.825
Jason Jason Ripper.

25:24.435 --> 25:26.699
I'm gasping for a pint.

25:26.742 --> 25:28.483
Come on.

25:30.572 --> 25:32.792
Question for you... Alfred.

25:32.835 --> 25:34.402
Go on, then.

25:34.445 --> 25:37.013
Think carefully
before you answer.

25:37.057 --> 25:39.755
Would you fuck your
mum to save her life?

25:39.799 --> 25:41.975
That's a funny question.

25:42.018 --> 25:44.151
Serious question.
It's very important.

25:44.194 --> 25:46.501
Would you

25:46.545 --> 25:49.896
fuck your mum
to save her life?

25:49.939 --> 25:51.941
Yes or

25:51.985 --> 25:53.900
no?

25:55.510 --> 25:57.294
Now, your personal problems

25:57.338 --> 25:59.122
are really none
of my business, Jason.

25:59.166 --> 26:02.212
But your mum's been
lying to you.

26:02.256 --> 26:04.214
Fucking her won't
cure anything.

26:06.826 --> 26:09.219
What the fuck are you doing
standing there for?!

26:09.263 --> 26:10.656
Go get fuckin' after him!

26:34.114 --> 26:36.551
Ah. Jason.

26:36.595 --> 26:39.902
This isn't gonna
end well for you, mate.

26:39.946 --> 26:42.078
Now you promise to leave Sandra
alone, and we'll say no more.

26:42.122 --> 26:43.776
Do what?

26:45.081 --> 26:47.693
San... Sandra?

26:47.736 --> 26:49.564
Say you'll leave her alone,

26:49.608 --> 26:52.306
and I'll let you walk away now.

26:54.482 --> 26:57.137
You really are...

26:57.180 --> 26:58.399
mental.

26:59.356 --> 27:01.054
Not as mental as your mum.

27:02.708 --> 27:03.970
All right, mate.

27:12.413 --> 27:14.110
BAZZA:
Stop!

27:14.154 --> 27:15.329
Dave!

27:15.372 --> 27:17.331
Daveboy! Cool down.

27:21.248 --> 27:23.903
Sorry.

27:23.946 --> 27:26.209
My uncle will have your
fucking guts for this.

27:26.253 --> 27:28.647
Your fucking guts!
You're fucking dead!

27:28.690 --> 27:30.649
You're fucking dead!

27:30.692 --> 27:32.912
Who am I, damn it?

27:32.955 --> 27:35.088
Who are you?
Who am I?

27:35.131 --> 27:37.873
You don't love me.
You can't even see me!

27:37.917 --> 27:39.832
You're blind, Johnny.

27:40.920 --> 27:43.313
Blind.

28:29.142 --> 28:31.187
That's a good trick.

28:34.625 --> 28:36.584
Who are you?

28:36.627 --> 28:38.717
How did you get in?

28:38.760 --> 28:40.849
Don't mind me saying,
Mr. Ripper,

28:40.893 --> 28:42.895
for a man of your stature,

28:42.938 --> 28:44.548
you have
rubbish security.

28:44.592 --> 28:46.550
Or perhaps you're good
at your job.

28:47.943 --> 28:49.902
Perhaps a bit of both.

28:49.945 --> 28:52.774
Anyway, here I am.

28:52.818 --> 28:55.951
Alfred Pennyworth is my name.

28:55.995 --> 28:58.519
I've known your name
since I were a baby, Mr. Ripper.

28:58.562 --> 29:00.173
I hold you in
the highest respect.

29:00.216 --> 29:01.740
I'm honored to meet you.

29:01.783 --> 29:04.786
"Pennyworth Security
Management.

29:04.830 --> 29:07.746
No job too big or small."

29:09.443 --> 29:12.359
This some kind
of promotional stunt, is it?

29:12.402 --> 29:14.013
You might say that.

29:14.056 --> 29:17.756
I'd say more like a gesture
of goodwill and respect.

29:21.107 --> 29:22.761
Oh, stop it.Darling, it was chemis...

29:22.804 --> 29:24.545
Congratulations.Thank you.

29:24.588 --> 29:26.025
MAN: I really
enjoyed...Oh. You're too kind.

29:26.068 --> 29:27.722
Thanks very much.Darling, it was chemistry.

29:27.766 --> 29:29.811
You can't fake
that sort of...Nonsense.

29:43.520 --> 29:45.827
Don't you fucking move!

29:52.138 --> 29:53.661
What's your name?

29:53.704 --> 29:55.358
Jason.

29:55.402 --> 29:56.664
No.

29:56.707 --> 29:58.753
Your name...

29:58.797 --> 30:01.277
is weasel.

30:01.321 --> 30:03.323
You're a wriggling

30:03.366 --> 30:05.238
little weasel.

30:05.281 --> 30:07.283
I'm Jason Ripper!

30:08.807 --> 30:10.983
I smell terror.

30:11.026 --> 30:14.813
Do you know terror smells
different than fear?

30:14.856 --> 30:18.686
We haven't even started.

30:18.729 --> 30:20.383
You...

30:20.427 --> 30:23.343
are going to break
like a twig.

30:25.911 --> 30:27.521
What's...

30:27.564 --> 30:29.305
your name?

30:30.698 --> 30:32.656
Shall I get
the tools?

30:32.700 --> 30:35.094
What do you say, weasel?
Shall he get the tools?

30:35.137 --> 30:36.747
I'll leave Sandra alone.

30:36.791 --> 30:39.402
Look, I'll-I'll never go
near her again, I swear.

30:39.446 --> 30:40.882
Sandra?

30:40.926 --> 30:42.928
We don't care about Sandra.

30:42.971 --> 30:44.059
Who's Sandra?

30:44.103 --> 30:45.887
What do you want?
What have I done?

30:45.931 --> 30:47.367
I don't--
I don't even know you.

30:48.498 --> 30:50.326
I'll get the tools.

30:57.681 --> 30:59.727
Stunning work.

30:59.770 --> 31:02.077
You were a revelation.

31:02.121 --> 31:03.731
I'm Jeremy.

31:03.774 --> 31:05.733
I'm waiting
for my boyfriend.

31:05.776 --> 31:07.735
He's not an actor,
too, is he?

31:07.778 --> 31:09.258
Never works.

31:09.302 --> 31:13.045
No. He creeps up on people
in the night and kills them.

31:14.133 --> 31:15.177
Okay.

31:38.592 --> 31:39.854
Please!

31:39.898 --> 31:42.074
Last... chance.

31:45.033 --> 31:47.818
What's... your...

31:49.255 --> 31:50.952
...name?

31:50.996 --> 31:52.345
Weasel.

31:52.388 --> 31:53.955
I can't hear you.

31:53.999 --> 31:55.130
Weasel.

31:55.174 --> 31:56.915
"My name is weasel, sir!"

31:56.958 --> 31:59.047
My name is weasel, sir!

31:59.091 --> 32:00.962
Good boy.

32:01.006 --> 32:03.399
Where are you from, weasel?

32:03.443 --> 32:05.358
Wh-Wh-Whitechapel.

32:07.403 --> 32:09.318
Who's Uncle John?

32:11.581 --> 32:12.713
Hmm?

32:16.108 --> 32:17.892
Who's Uncle John!?

32:17.936 --> 32:19.546
J-John Ripper!J-J...

32:19.589 --> 32:21.417
John Ripper?

32:21.461 --> 32:23.289
The big man?

32:23.332 --> 32:25.247
You work for him, yes?

32:25.291 --> 32:27.380
Yes.

32:27.423 --> 32:29.991
He can't help you
now, can he?

32:30.035 --> 32:32.341
No.Shh, shh, shh, shh.

32:34.256 --> 32:36.345
My boy, I want you to listen

32:36.389 --> 32:38.739
to me very closely.

32:40.567 --> 32:42.656
We don't give a fuck
about you.

32:42.699 --> 32:45.006
We don't give a
fuck about you.

32:45.050 --> 32:46.877
You're nothing.

32:46.921 --> 32:48.314
Nobody.

32:48.357 --> 32:50.185
Shit.

32:50.229 --> 32:52.187
We'll let you live...

32:52.231 --> 32:56.322
if you tell us
about your Uncle John.

32:56.365 --> 32:58.541
You want to live,
don't you!?Yes, sir, yes, sir!

32:58.585 --> 33:01.849
Then tell us everything
you know about John Ripper!

33:03.285 --> 33:05.113
Everything!

33:05.157 --> 33:06.158
Say "yes."

33:06.201 --> 33:07.811
Yes.Yes what!?

33:07.855 --> 33:10.858
Yes, sir! Yes, sir,
I'll tell you everything, sir!

33:10.901 --> 33:13.208
ALFRED:
That'll do.

33:18.866 --> 33:20.999
My own flesh and blood.

33:26.308 --> 33:29.833
I'm sorry.Stop sniveling.

33:29.877 --> 33:31.966
If it wouldn't break

33:32.010 --> 33:34.142
my sister's heart...

33:34.186 --> 33:36.188
I'd skin you alive.

33:37.319 --> 33:39.974
Break her heart?

33:40.018 --> 33:42.803
Hasn't she seen enough horrors?

33:42.846 --> 33:44.152
Oh, God.

33:44.196 --> 33:45.632
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

33:45.675 --> 33:47.503
Don't talk to me...

33:47.547 --> 33:49.288
about God.

33:50.854 --> 33:52.769
You're leaving London.

33:52.813 --> 33:54.771
I don't care where you go.

33:54.815 --> 33:58.384
If you come back...

33:58.427 --> 34:00.299
I'll cut...

34:00.342 --> 34:02.431
your face...

34:02.475 --> 34:03.824
off.

34:23.235 --> 34:25.019
Good luck, mate.

34:31.678 --> 34:33.593
Fuck!

35:09.498 --> 35:11.370
SYKES:
Dear Esme,

35:11.413 --> 35:13.154
hello again.

35:13.198 --> 35:15.809
I hope you're
happy and healthy.

35:15.852 --> 35:18.203
Yours truly
is keeping cheerful.

35:18.246 --> 35:20.118
I'm writing to tell you

35:20.161 --> 35:22.381
how much I enjoyed
our time together.

35:22.424 --> 35:26.036
You're a beautiful
and special person.

35:26.080 --> 35:28.126
If I were ever free,

35:28.169 --> 35:30.432
I think we'd become
good friends.

35:30.476 --> 35:33.087
Forgive and forget,
that's what I say.

35:33.131 --> 35:34.523
Anyway...

35:34.567 --> 35:36.525
be good.
Cheerio for now.

35:36.569 --> 35:38.614
Your friend, Bet.

35:39.833 --> 35:42.009
Kiss, kiss...

35:42.052 --> 35:43.576
kiss.

35:48.755 --> 35:50.452
I am intrigued.

35:51.801 --> 35:54.152
What do you expect
me to do now?

35:54.195 --> 35:56.676
I expect you'll be
angry with us.

35:56.719 --> 35:59.418
It's only natural.

35:59.461 --> 36:00.462
What's your game?

36:00.506 --> 36:02.029
What it says
on the card.

36:02.072 --> 36:04.031
Security management.

36:04.074 --> 36:06.468
You're ex-soldiers.

36:06.512 --> 36:09.254
From a good regiment.

36:09.297 --> 36:10.777
Catering corps.

36:10.820 --> 36:12.126
Cooks.

36:14.650 --> 36:17.610
What did Jason do to you?

36:17.653 --> 36:19.438
I asked him
to leave a girl alone,

36:19.481 --> 36:20.656
and he wouldn't.Ah.

36:20.700 --> 36:22.092
A hero.

36:22.136 --> 36:24.443
Your sweetheart,
is she?

36:24.486 --> 36:26.140
Just a job.

36:26.184 --> 36:28.403
"No job too big
or too small."

36:29.709 --> 36:32.625
I hope they
paid you well.

36:32.668 --> 36:35.410
Tell me why I shouldn't
just toss you in that oven.

36:35.454 --> 36:37.499
Well, I'm off
in a minute.

36:37.543 --> 36:39.458
I expect I can find you.

36:39.501 --> 36:41.460
I expect so.

36:41.503 --> 36:44.245
Until you do, I'll be trouble
that you don't need.

36:44.289 --> 36:46.160
And that's the last thing
I want to be.

36:47.944 --> 36:49.468
Come.

36:49.511 --> 36:51.252
Look upon a marvel.

36:59.652 --> 37:02.481
These are the viscera.

37:02.524 --> 37:03.525
I know.

37:03.569 --> 37:05.571
Ah, of course. A cook.

37:06.963 --> 37:09.009
Such subtle colors.

37:10.140 --> 37:11.403
You find...

37:11.446 --> 37:13.840
all sorts...

37:13.883 --> 37:16.799
in the stomach.

37:16.843 --> 37:19.062
Gold sovereign, once.

37:19.106 --> 37:22.196
Bought Mother
a crocodile handbag.

37:24.111 --> 37:26.287
What sort of trouble
are you going to be?

37:27.854 --> 37:30.422
Comes in all shapes
and sizes, doesn't it?

37:30.465 --> 37:32.859
This young man thought
hewas trouble.

37:32.902 --> 37:35.775
Now he's offal.

37:35.818 --> 37:37.298
Looking at all this

37:37.342 --> 37:39.387
from the sunny side
of the street, Mr. Ripper,

37:39.431 --> 37:42.216
we've both had
a result, haven't we?

37:42.260 --> 37:43.913
My client's safe,

37:43.957 --> 37:46.089
and you're rid of a weak link.

37:47.352 --> 37:49.658
Nothing better than kidney pie.

37:50.877 --> 37:52.618
The faint tang of piss.

38:02.454 --> 38:04.238
Let's sit down.

38:15.336 --> 38:16.729
RIPPER:
A glass of wine?

38:16.772 --> 38:18.992
No, thanks.

38:19.035 --> 38:20.689
How did you know...

38:20.733 --> 38:22.387
Jason was weak?

38:22.430 --> 38:25.215
Only had to look at him.

38:25.259 --> 38:26.695
Only a look?

38:26.739 --> 38:28.871
He's a flincher.

38:28.915 --> 38:31.352
Everybody knows Rippers
don't flinch.

38:31.396 --> 38:34.007
It's not right.

38:34.050 --> 38:36.314
Sort of a black mark against
the whole East End, isn't it?

38:38.446 --> 38:40.013
I said to myself,
here's a chance

38:40.056 --> 38:41.841
to do a good turn
for the guv'nor.

38:43.625 --> 38:46.367
Out of...

38:46.411 --> 38:48.021
goodwill and respect.

38:48.064 --> 38:49.544
Exactly.

38:50.676 --> 38:52.112
I had me own reasons,

38:52.155 --> 38:53.809
of course.

38:53.853 --> 38:56.072
The business hasn't
taken wing yet, to be honest.

38:56.116 --> 38:58.988
And I knew this job to be
a gamble, but I thought

38:59.032 --> 39:01.295
I needed to do something drastic
to get the business

39:01.339 --> 39:02.862
off the ground.

39:02.905 --> 39:05.038
No, you were hoping
I'd be amused by your front

39:05.081 --> 39:07.736
and let you
walk away.

39:07.780 --> 39:10.913
No. I was hoping
that you might let me operate

39:10.957 --> 39:13.002
on your manor,
put the word about

39:13.046 --> 39:15.614
I'm kosher.

39:15.657 --> 39:17.311
Thinks he's

39:17.355 --> 39:18.747
the business.

39:19.879 --> 39:21.881
Lairy as fuck.

39:21.924 --> 39:24.579
A shrewd judge of character,
hethinks.

39:27.495 --> 39:30.237
I'll give him credit.

39:30.280 --> 39:32.326
He's a brave punter.

39:33.936 --> 39:36.199
Is he stupid or clever?

39:37.331 --> 39:39.159
I can't tell.

39:39.202 --> 39:41.509
Which is it?

39:41.553 --> 39:43.250
That's a very good question.

39:58.526 --> 40:00.006
Which is it?

40:00.049 --> 40:01.442
Stupid or clever?

40:01.486 --> 40:03.531
Well, the safe money
would be on stupid.

40:05.228 --> 40:07.796
But you've got to back yourself,
haven't you?

40:50.143 --> 40:51.492
My God.
Thank God it's you.

40:51.536 --> 40:53.668
I am sorry. Are you all right?

40:56.366 --> 40:57.759
Where have you been? It's 4:00.

40:57.803 --> 41:00.458
Working.

41:00.501 --> 41:02.634
What's wrong?

41:02.677 --> 41:04.723
I nearly died.

41:04.766 --> 41:06.681
Uh...

41:10.555 --> 41:12.644
Oh, you poor love.

41:12.687 --> 41:14.210
That must have been
a horrible shock.

41:14.254 --> 41:15.298
Here. Come here.

41:15.342 --> 41:16.909
Hey, it's okay.

41:16.952 --> 41:18.693
Shh. Shh.

41:18.737 --> 41:21.130
Hey.

41:23.393 --> 41:25.526
I felt so scared and alone
without you here.

41:26.658 --> 41:28.529
I'm sorry, Ez.

41:28.573 --> 41:32.620
I'm sorry about Bet Sykes
and the whole dirty business.

41:32.664 --> 41:34.492
Stop it.

41:34.535 --> 41:36.755
You rescued me.

41:36.798 --> 41:39.584
It's not dirty,
it's romantic.

41:39.627 --> 41:42.238
Well, when you
put it like that...

41:45.067 --> 41:47.548
What's that on your jacket?

41:47.592 --> 41:49.028
All over the back,
what have you got...?

41:49.071 --> 41:50.595
No, it's mud.
Look, it's fine.

41:50.638 --> 41:51.857
It's just mud.

41:51.900 --> 41:53.815
I fell over.

42:10.658 --> 42:12.878
A letter, madam.

42:22.931 --> 42:24.672
SYKES:
Dear Peggy,

42:24.716 --> 42:26.021
I hope you're well.

42:26.065 --> 42:27.980
I'm sorry, but I'm writing

42:28.023 --> 42:30.069
to say good-bye and God bless, 'cause, believe it or not,

42:30.112 --> 42:31.853
I'm in the Tower
of bloody London

42:31.897 --> 42:33.551
and the bastards
are scragging me next week

42:33.594 --> 42:35.465
for something I did not do.

42:35.509 --> 42:37.380
You've always been
a good sister to me.

42:37.424 --> 42:39.731
I wish you health and happiness for the future.

42:39.774 --> 42:42.647
Please remember me
when I'm gone.

42:42.690 --> 42:46.955
Very best regards,
your loving sister, Bet.

42:46.999 --> 42:49.349
Kiss, kiss, kiss.

Oh, cheers, Jobbo.

43:35.743 --> 43:37.136
Don't drink that.

43:37.179 --> 43:39.051
It's horrible.

43:40.574 --> 43:42.576
I had no idea you were
such a famous figure.

43:42.620 --> 43:43.795
Aye, it's my local.

43:43.838 --> 43:45.492
Everybody knows everybody.

43:45.535 --> 43:48.451
They adore you. Did you save
someone's life or something?

43:48.495 --> 43:50.758
They're just friendly people.

43:50.802 --> 43:53.282
I'll be back in a tick.

43:53.326 --> 43:55.633
Don't let that one
sit next to you.

43:55.676 --> 43:57.156
Hands.

44:01.247 --> 44:04.816
Alfie, words are not enough.

44:04.859 --> 44:06.861
Yeah. That's true.

44:06.905 --> 44:08.384
Oh. Right.

44:10.299 --> 44:11.692
Worth every penny, mate.

44:11.736 --> 44:13.912
We'll say no more
about it. Shtum.

44:13.955 --> 44:15.087
As the grave.

44:15.130 --> 44:16.392
If anybody asks
about me, though,

44:16.436 --> 44:17.611
you can just tell 'em

44:17.655 --> 44:18.873
that you're
a satisfied customer.

44:18.917 --> 44:20.527
Helps put my name about.

44:20.570 --> 44:21.571
Gotcha.

44:23.704 --> 44:25.140
Sands.
Thanks, Alfie.

44:25.184 --> 44:26.489
Hey. You're welcome.

44:27.708 --> 44:28.883
Thanks, Daveboy.

44:28.927 --> 44:30.842
Aye.

44:30.885 --> 44:33.932
God bless you.

44:33.975 --> 44:36.325
Here ya are.Yep.

44:40.895 --> 44:44.594
It's Lucifer's silver,
but to fuck with it.

44:44.638 --> 44:46.509
Hey, Sid's no angel,
but he's not Lucifer.

44:46.553 --> 44:49.077
Laugh and joke
as you may, Alfie.

44:49.121 --> 44:50.731
But you know what path
we've taken.

44:50.775 --> 44:52.254
You miserable sod.

44:52.298 --> 44:54.604
Who said
who the fuck dares wins?

44:54.648 --> 44:56.694
I got the nod
from the dark man himself.

44:56.737 --> 44:58.783
You watch, business
is gonna take off like a rocket.

44:58.826 --> 45:01.568
You watch.
I-I'm not saying
what you done was wrong,

45:01.611 --> 45:04.223
I'm just saying what's what.

45:04.266 --> 45:06.007
We've made a pact
with Satan, Alfie.

45:06.051 --> 45:08.618
A pact with Satan.

45:08.662 --> 45:09.837
Yeah. We've done that before.

45:09.881 --> 45:11.621
Many a time.

45:11.665 --> 45:13.667
Too many, maybe.

45:13.711 --> 45:15.321
Hey, I can handle Ripper.

45:15.364 --> 45:17.236
You keep smiling, sunshine.

45:24.373 --> 45:26.071
Not too rowdy for you?

45:26.114 --> 45:27.594
No. It's marvelous.

45:32.077 --> 45:34.253
HARWOOD :
Me.

45:34.296 --> 45:35.254
Me.

45:35.297 --> 45:36.821
Did you say something?

45:36.864 --> 45:39.127
Me.

45:39.171 --> 45:41.521
No, you'll have to speak up.

45:41.564 --> 45:43.566
HARWOOD : Me.

45:43.610 --> 45:47.353
I'm the leader.

45:47.396 --> 45:50.225
Me.

45:50.269 --> 45:52.793
You are telling the truth,
aren't you?

45:52.837 --> 45:56.405
On your honor
and so forth?

45:56.449 --> 45:58.320
Shit-arse cocksucker.

46:01.715 --> 46:03.891
You, James?

46:03.935 --> 46:08.069
Leader of the Raven Society?

46:08.113 --> 46:10.855
Extraordinary.

46:10.898 --> 46:13.814
Hiding in plain sight, eh?

46:13.858 --> 46:17.339
Oh, bally clever.

46:17.383 --> 46:20.560
You want to stage a coup.
Run the country?

46:20.603 --> 46:23.389
Brave and resourceful,
certainly,

46:23.432 --> 46:26.740
but mad as a fucking hatter.

46:26.784 --> 46:30.526
Oh. Indeed.

46:30.570 --> 46:33.747
Well, you've put me on
a damned sticky wicket.

46:33.791 --> 46:35.793
Can't very well execute
a lord,

46:35.836 --> 46:38.230
nor can I hold you
indefinitely.

46:38.273 --> 46:40.623
Habeas bloody corpus,
all that rot.

46:40.667 --> 46:42.843
Fuck your cunt mother.

46:42.887 --> 46:46.064
Well, I've considered
the notion,

46:46.107 --> 46:48.588
but the appropriate moment's
never really arisen.

46:51.591 --> 46:55.203
Still full of spirit,
eh, James?

46:55.247 --> 46:57.727
Still plucky.

46:57.771 --> 46:59.817
And good for you.

46:59.860 --> 47:02.558
But it won't do, I'm afraid.

47:04.256 --> 47:07.302
Send Lord Harwood

47:07.346 --> 47:10.218
to the barbers.

47:10.262 --> 47:11.654
They're to keep him alive...

47:14.266 --> 47:16.137
...but break him.

47:27.279 --> 47:29.368
I don't believe you.
That nice lady in pink?

47:29.411 --> 47:30.717
On my life.

47:30.760 --> 47:32.284
She looked quite respectable.

47:32.327 --> 47:33.720
So do you.

47:33.763 --> 47:35.243
That's not a very
kind thing to say.

47:35.287 --> 47:37.158
No, I don't mean
that you're a brass.

47:37.202 --> 47:38.681
You know all the better kind
of girls

47:38.725 --> 47:40.988
are having sex
before marriage these days.

47:41.032 --> 47:43.599
It's perfectly acceptable;
fashionable, practically.

47:43.643 --> 47:45.775
No. I mean you look beautiful.
That's all.

47:45.819 --> 47:47.734
It's the implication.

47:47.777 --> 47:49.388
The implication.

47:49.431 --> 47:51.216
Stop it.

47:51.259 --> 47:53.174
What? You angry with me now?

47:53.218 --> 47:54.741
Yes. I am, actually.

47:54.784 --> 47:56.482
Good.

47:56.525 --> 47:58.614
'Cause angry people are honest
and we need to talk.

47:58.658 --> 48:01.791
Stop trying to change
the subject. Talk about what?

48:01.835 --> 48:03.663
The future.

48:03.706 --> 48:05.447
We-we don't know
what's coming, do we?

48:05.491 --> 48:09.321
But, well, that's part of
the fun of it, not knowing.

48:09.364 --> 48:11.584
Now, what I do know:

48:11.627 --> 48:14.761
I know that you're a princess.

48:14.804 --> 48:16.850
And I know
that I'd slay dragons for you,

48:16.894 --> 48:19.722
that I'll always protect you,
I'll always respect you,

48:19.766 --> 48:21.463
and I'll always love you
with all my heart.

48:41.483 --> 48:43.921
You have to say it.

48:51.580 --> 48:52.930
Will you marry me?

48:54.670 --> 48:56.803
Yes. Yes, I will.

49:03.723 --> 49:05.986
Here, put it on.

49:06.030 --> 49:07.640
Did you practice that?

49:07.683 --> 49:09.076
It was very good.

49:09.120 --> 49:11.557
No. Just sort of
came out like that.

50:17.623 --> 50:19.625
MALE ANNOUNCER :

For grand treason.

51:56.635 --> 51:57.897
This is her.

51:57.940 --> 51:59.551
All right?
It's all right.

52:20.137 --> 52:22.617
It's done.

52:22.661 --> 52:24.706
MARY:
Writing in hell forever.

52:24.750 --> 52:27.492
Buggered by scaly demons.

52:30.799 --> 52:32.714
I'll put the kettle on.

52:48.513 --> 52:50.341
Fancy a pint?

52:50.384 --> 52:51.559
Something good, sir.

53:06.008 --> 53:07.662
You all right?

53:07.706 --> 53:09.490
Not too bad.

53:09.534 --> 53:11.318
I'm that peckish, though.

53:11.362 --> 53:13.015
Rubbish scran
in the Tower.

53:15.192 --> 53:17.281
PEGGY:
Well, there's a Happy Eater
just past Luton.

53:17.324 --> 53:21.324
A nice fry up'll do you good.
