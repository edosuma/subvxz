Yeah,
be a shark monster.

I don't want to be
a shark monster.

01:26.875 --> 01:28.333
We're pretending
we're surfers,

01:28.333 --> 01:30.500
and we need you to be
the shark monster.

01:30.500 --> 01:32.875
I don't want to be
a shark monster.

01:32.875 --> 01:35.083
Please be
our shark monster?

I'm a shark monster.

01:54.250 --> 01:56.166

in the morning.

01:56.166 --> 01:58.500
(barking)

01:58.500 --> 02:00.291
We like seeing you, too, Bob.

02:00.291 --> 02:01.833
We were pretending
to surf, and--

02:01.833 --> 02:03.208
(barking)

02:03.208 --> 02:05.750
And "ruff-ruff"
to you guys, too!

02:08.625 --> 02:11.875
Hawaii! Now
that is a place

02:11.875 --> 02:13.708
I would really
like to go.

02:13.708 --> 02:16.458
-(Rolly snoring)
-Big blue waves,
sandy beaches.

02:16.458 --> 02:20.750
Yeah, I would love
to feel that sand
on my toes someday.

02:20.750 --> 02:22.416
Hmm.

02:22.416 --> 02:25.291
But right now,
I've gotta get to work
and invent neat stuff

02:25.291 --> 02:26.833
to put in
your doghouse.

02:26.833 --> 02:28.333
I wonder
if a zip line

02:28.333 --> 02:29.583
and
a waterslide

02:29.583 --> 02:31.250
would fit
in there?

02:31.250 --> 02:32.583
Hope you guys find
something fun to do

02:32.583 --> 02:34.250

02:43.750 --> 02:45.291
Oh, that's right.

02:45.291 --> 02:46.333
The gardener's
here today,

02:46.333 --> 02:48.291
using the
leaf blower.

02:48.291 --> 02:51.125
-Could be a bit noisy all day!
-(leaf blower buzzing loudly)

02:52.458 --> 02:54.500
Did you hear
what Bob said?

02:54.500 --> 02:57.958
Just barely.
That leaf blower
really is noisy.

02:57.958 --> 03:01.458
I mean about wanting to feel
the sand from Hawaii
on his toes.

03:01.458 --> 03:03.416
We need to go there,
get some sand

03:03.416 --> 03:06.625
and bring it back,
so his toes will be, "Yay!"

03:06.625 --> 03:08.875
'Cause happy toes
means happy Bob.

03:08.875 --> 03:09.958

We should take some dog biscuits
with us for the airplane ride.

03:34.583 --> 03:37.458
Good thing Bob invented
these collars for us
to put stuff in.

03:39.833 --> 03:42.166

exciting, Frank?

04:14.000 --> 04:15.708
We're on our way
to Hawaii!

flying this plane doesn't

Aloha,
and welcome to Hawaii!

little puppies!

05:01.875 --> 05:03.708

05:03.708 --> 05:05.833
This smells nice.
What is it?

05:05.833 --> 05:07.458
-Lei.
-Okay.

05:07.458 --> 05:09.458
Rolly, what are
you doing?

05:09.458 --> 05:12.166
I'm doing the trick
that Bob taught us: lay.

05:12.166 --> 05:14.250
I was talking about that thing
around your neck.

05:14.250 --> 05:17.000
-It's a lei.
-And so is this!

05:17.000 --> 05:19.583
(laughs) Rolly.
A lei is the Hawaiian name

05:19.583 --> 05:21.333
for this necklace
made of flowers.

05:21.333 --> 05:23.458
They should've just
called it a neck flower.

05:23.458 --> 05:25.125
Have fun at the beach, you two!

05:25.125 --> 05:27.000
Isn't this exciting, Frank?

05:27.000 --> 05:29.083
Now we get to go to the beach!

05:29.083 --> 05:32.416
I hope I don't get sunburned
'cause that hurts my tummy.

05:32.416 --> 05:35.000
Come on! The beach
is where all the sand is,

05:35.000 --> 05:36.875
so that's where
we need to be, too!

05:41.458 --> 05:43.291
(barks)

05:43.291 --> 05:46.166
All this sand is exactly
what Bob needs for his toes.

05:48.458 --> 05:51.708
And it's exactly what
I need to chase crabs on.

05:55.500 --> 05:56.708

06:05.291 --> 06:06.291
(grunts)

06:12.958 --> 06:15.000
This thing just got personal.

06:25.125 --> 06:28.583
(sighs)
At least now we have a pile
of sand to take home.

06:28.583 --> 06:30.000
(grunts)

06:30.000 --> 06:32.125
If we can figure out
how to get it there.

06:32.125 --> 06:34.875
We need something big...
that flies.

06:34.875 --> 06:36.291
Like a big fly?

06:36.291 --> 06:38.583
Bigger and fly-y-er.
So let's get to work.

06:39.708 --> 06:42.458
-Bingo: All done.
-Good idea, Bingo.

06:42.458 --> 06:46.166
We can fly all the sand
Bob wants back to him
in this airplane we built.

06:46.166 --> 06:48.416
-You ready to go?
-Sure am.

06:48.416 --> 06:50.583
-Wave!
-Good idea.

06:50.583 --> 06:53.000
We should wave
goodbye to everyone
before we take off.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.583
No, I mean... wave!

06:56.583 --> 06:58.000
Both:
Oh, no.

07:06.625 --> 07:08.583
Maybe we should've built
a seaplane.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.875
Wait a minute.
We're at the beach.

07:11.875 --> 07:14.458
We don't need a plane.
We need...

07:14.458 --> 07:15.625
a boat!

07:15.625 --> 07:17.458
I knew that sock
would come in handy.

07:17.458 --> 07:18.875
Both:
Oh!

07:23.000 --> 07:24.583
(grunting)

07:26.625 --> 07:27.708
(grunts)

07:27.708 --> 07:28.833
(grunts)

07:29.833 --> 07:30.833
(spits)

07:34.416 --> 07:37.333
Sorry to abandon ship,
but I've got a crab to catch.

07:37.333 --> 07:40.625
Rolly. We came here
to get sand for Bob's toes,

07:40.625 --> 07:43.250
not chase everything
that's crawling on the beach.

07:43.250 --> 07:45.208
What are you doing
walking away from me?

07:45.208 --> 07:46.416
I was talking to you.

07:46.416 --> 07:48.375
I'm not walkin' away
from you.

07:48.375 --> 07:50.000
You're walkin'
away from me.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.291
Except, neither of us
is walking.

07:53.291 --> 07:55.583
Uh, I'm floating.

07:55.583 --> 07:57.583
We're both floating!

07:57.583 --> 07:58.958
Both:
In the ocean!

08:01.458 --> 08:04.833
Woo-hoo!
Aloha, puppy dudes!

08:04.833 --> 08:06.416
Are you guys here
for the surfing contest?

08:06.416 --> 08:07.708
-Woo-hoo!
-Yah!

08:07.708 --> 08:10.000
This is a surfing
contest for dogs?

08:10.000 --> 08:11.208
-Yeah!
-Yah.

08:11.208 --> 08:13.208
We four-leggers
are gonna ride the next wave,

08:13.208 --> 08:15.875
and whoever surfs the best,
wins a trophy.

08:15.875 --> 08:17.958
But we've never surfed
for real before.

08:17.958 --> 08:21.291
Well, you're about to
because-- Look out!

08:24.583 --> 08:27.458
-Bingo!
-We can do this, Rolly!

08:27.458 --> 08:28.625
Just like
on our skateboards!

08:28.625 --> 08:30.750

09:02.875 --> 09:04.083
-First place!
-Yah, totally!

extra points for being
extra huggable.

Yah, see ya, bro-dogs!

09:11.500 --> 09:12.750
Aloha!

09:12.750 --> 09:15.166
Okay, this trophy
is cool and all,

09:15.166 --> 09:17.708
but our mission
was to bring back sand
for Bob's toes.

09:17.708 --> 09:20.708
And we still need
something to put it in.

09:20.708 --> 09:23.583
(panting)
I'm gonna find you, crabby!

09:25.708 --> 09:28.708
Rolly, it's really hard
for me to think with
all of that sand

09:28.708 --> 09:31.875
flying past my face
and into... the trophy!

09:33.333 --> 09:35.125
Did you say
something, Bingo?

09:35.125 --> 09:36.583
Keep digging, Rolly!

09:36.583 --> 09:37.708
Just...
Just keep digging!

09:37.708 --> 09:39.625
Anything for you,
my brother!

09:41.500 --> 09:44.833
Rolly:
Bob's gonna be so happy
when he sees all this sand
for his toes.

09:44.833 --> 09:48.333
We should celebrate
by eating those dog biscuits
I put in our collars.

09:48.333 --> 09:49.875
Yeah!

09:49.875 --> 09:52.458
I already ate mine
on the way here.

09:52.458 --> 09:54.750
That's okay.
I can share mine.

09:54.750 --> 09:56.708
I ate yours, too.

09:56.708 --> 09:57.708
(laughs) Rolly!

09:59.375 --> 10:01.291
Bingo:
We're almost done
with our mission, Rolly.

10:01.291 --> 10:03.875
All we have to do
is get this inside and--

10:03.875 --> 10:05.166
-(leaf blower buzzing)
-What's happening?

10:05.166 --> 10:07.000
It's the gardener's
leaf blower!

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
It's blowing
all the sand away!

10:12.000 --> 10:13.416
Bye-bye, sand.

10:13.416 --> 10:15.000
Aloha, dudes.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.416
(clangs)

10:17.875 --> 10:19.875
It's gone,
all of it.

10:19.875 --> 10:23.250
Except for all the sand
that's in my ears.

10:23.250 --> 10:26.500
Yeah, we really got covered
in that stuff at the beach.

10:26.500 --> 10:29.583
Rolly, wait!
We have all the sand we need!

10:29.583 --> 10:30.875
All over the two of us!

10:30.875 --> 10:33.958
So when Bob gets home,
all we have to do is...

10:33.958 --> 10:35.000
shake, shake, shake!

10:35.000 --> 10:37.416
-Okay!
-What are you doing?

10:37.416 --> 10:40.625
I'm doing that other trick
Bob taught us: shake.

10:40.625 --> 10:42.750
No. I meant,
shake, shake!

10:42.750 --> 10:44.500
But not till
Bob gets home.

10:44.500 --> 10:45.583
Come on!

10:51.625 --> 10:54.250
And when Bob gets home,
we're gonna go, shake,
shake, shake.

10:54.250 --> 10:57.125
And his toes are gonna
be like, "What?"

10:57.125 --> 10:59.291
And then they're gonna
be all, "Wow!"

10:59.291 --> 11:02.208
Did you miss us
while we were gone?

11:02.208 --> 11:05.083
Let's see, there were
no little puppies around
to almost run me over

11:05.083 --> 11:09.000
or wake me up from my nap,
or beg me to be a shark monster

11:09.000 --> 11:11.166
until I finally said okay!

11:12.375 --> 11:15.416
(chuckles) Aw.
I did miss you guys.

11:15.416 --> 11:16.625
A little bit.

11:16.625 --> 11:17.958
-(door opens)
-Bob: I'm home!

11:17.958 --> 11:19.000
-Hi, Bob!
-Bob!

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
(barking)

11:22.000 --> 11:23.833
Aw, hey there, guys!

11:23.833 --> 11:26.958
I've been lookin' forward
to seein' you all day!

11:26.958 --> 11:29.583
Whoa! What'd you two get into?

11:30.958 --> 11:32.625
It's sand for your toes!

11:32.625 --> 11:34.291
We brought it back
from Hawaii.

11:34.291 --> 11:36.875
I don't know how the two of you
got so sandy,

11:36.875 --> 11:39.333
but you brought most of it
into the house.

11:40.458 --> 11:42.958
And now it's
all over my toes.

11:42.958 --> 11:47.958
(giggles) Actually,
that feels really good.

11:47.958 --> 11:51.000
Like what the beach
must feel like in Hawaii.

11:51.000 --> 11:56.625
If my toes could talk,
each one of them would
be saying, "Thank you!"

11:56.625 --> 11:58.125
Bingo:
You're welcome, Bob!

11:58.125 --> 12:00.375
(barking)

12:00.375 --> 12:02.291
(sighs)

12:07.083 --> 12:07.833
ARF:
"A.R.F."

12:10.000 --> 12:12.125
(grunting)

12:13.625 --> 12:15.291
You ready for liftoff, Rolly?

12:15.291 --> 12:17.291
Just gotta put on
my safety gear.

12:17.291 --> 12:18.833
Ready!

12:20.583 --> 12:21.583
(Bingo grunts)

12:22.583 --> 12:25.000
I'm flying!

12:25.000 --> 12:26.583
I'm falling!

12:26.583 --> 12:27.875
(grunts)

12:29.958 --> 12:32.625
-Hissy: How was your flight?
-A little bumpy
on the landing.

12:32.625 --> 12:35.375
Guys? Come see
what I made for you.

12:35.375 --> 12:38.708
What is it, Bob?
I wanna see.

12:38.708 --> 12:41.125
(barking)

12:41.125 --> 12:44.000
I was thinking about how
the two of you and Hissy
are here all day

12:44.000 --> 12:47.125
and how I wish
I could be with you.

12:47.125 --> 12:50.166
So, I invented this
to do the kinds of things

12:50.166 --> 12:52.125
I'd do if I was here.

12:58.875 --> 13:00.208
(beeps)

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
Arf! Arf! Hi, Bingo!
Hi, Rolly!

13:09.125 --> 13:11.375
I call him... ARF!

13:11.375 --> 13:15.000
Which stands for
Auto-Doggie Robotic Friend.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.875
If you guys get hungry...

13:16.875 --> 13:19.375
Would you like ARF
to bring you a treat?

13:19.375 --> 13:20.458
...or scared...

13:20.458 --> 13:22.125
It will be okay.

13:22.125 --> 13:23.208
...or lonely...

13:23.208 --> 13:25.166
ARF wants to sit
in a circle
with you and sing!

13:25.166 --> 13:26.125
(strums chord)

13:26.125 --> 13:27.875
...ARF is here to do it all!

13:29.458 --> 13:32.000
I even programmed him
to clean up any mess
that you make

13:32.000 --> 13:34.083
before I get home from work,

13:34.083 --> 13:36.416
so we can have
more time to play.

13:42.708 --> 13:44.958
ARF: Uh-oh,
things are looking messy.

13:47.583 --> 13:50.958
But with ARF here,
no more mess.

13:50.958 --> 13:54.166
I still haven't
programmed him
to do everything.

13:54.166 --> 13:57.708
But I hope my little doggies
have a fun day seeing
what he does do.

13:57.708 --> 13:59.125
Arf! Arf!

13:59.125 --> 14:02.708
Can't wait to play
with you tail-waggers
when I get home!

14:07.333 --> 14:08.833
(both sniffing)

14:08.833 --> 14:10.583
Hmm.
He looks friendly.

14:10.583 --> 14:13.208
(sniffing)

14:13.208 --> 14:15.000
Rolly:
He smells friendly, too.

14:17.583 --> 14:18.625
(both grunt)

14:20.875 --> 14:22.083
Arf! Arf!

14:22.083 --> 14:23.875
(giggling)

14:23.875 --> 14:25.875
Hey, Hissy!
Want to meet ARF?

14:25.875 --> 14:29.125
Maybe later. I'm trying
to get this one spot
on the back of my neck

14:29.125 --> 14:31.166
really clean,
which means...

14:31.166 --> 14:34.000
(grunts) I could be
at this all morning.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.875
Aah! (yowls)

14:35.875 --> 14:37.000
I'm okay.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.750
What are we supposed
to do with you?

14:38.750 --> 14:41.208
Whatever you do
on a regular day.

14:41.208 --> 14:43.416
Well, some days we go
on fun adventures,

14:43.416 --> 14:46.250
and other days,
we stay here and make
a really big mess.

14:46.250 --> 14:48.333
Make a mess! Yeah!
Make a mess!

14:48.333 --> 14:50.708
So ARF can have fun
cleaning it up!

14:50.708 --> 14:54.083
Wait a minute! You want us
to mess this place up?

14:54.083 --> 14:56.250
Yes! Oh, yes!
Oh, yes!

14:56.250 --> 14:58.458
Now that's something
two dogs know how to do.

15:00.958 --> 15:01.958
(toy squeaks)

15:19.833 --> 15:22.000
ARF's gonna love
cleaning up this!

15:22.000 --> 15:24.458
And even more,
he'll love this!

15:32.083 --> 15:35.000
I really should get around
to reading these books someday,

15:35.000 --> 15:36.750
but first I gotta learn
how to read.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.625
Ah, nice job. I can hardly
see the floor at all.

15:40.625 --> 15:43.833
It's always so hard
to get the last ones
out of the bag.

15:43.833 --> 15:45.291
(growling)

15:45.291 --> 15:48.000
Hey, hey, hey!

15:48.000 --> 15:50.375
It always happens.
You wash your neck all morning,

15:50.375 --> 15:52.708
then it rains dog food
right after you do it!

15:53.750 --> 15:55.708
Aah! (yowls)

15:55.708 --> 15:57.625
Hissy: I'm okay.

15:57.625 --> 16:01.125
Wow. If Bob came home
from work and saw a mess
like this,

16:01.125 --> 16:04.416
he'd have to clean it up
and wouldn't be able
to play with us at all.

16:04.416 --> 16:05.958
Aw.

16:05.958 --> 16:08.500
But he's not going to have
to clean it up because you are!

16:08.500 --> 16:11.458
That's right.
ARF loves to clean!

16:22.875 --> 16:26.208
(giggles)
Look at that Auto-Doggie
Robotic Friend go!

16:26.208 --> 16:29.458
Yeah. He's a better
cleaner-upper than
we are messer-uppers.

16:29.458 --> 16:30.708
And that's a statement.

17:01.375 --> 17:03.458
Bingo and Rolly should make
another mess,

17:03.458 --> 17:06.291
so ARF can clean it up,
the way Bob programmed ARF to.

17:06.291 --> 17:08.125
Please?

17:08.125 --> 17:10.416
Bob also programmed
ARF to beg.

17:10.416 --> 17:13.208
-I don't think we have
another mess in us.
-(yawns)

17:13.208 --> 17:16.583
Yeah, I think we're just
gonna take a little nap.

17:16.583 --> 17:18.500
(snoring)

17:18.500 --> 17:22.208
Oh. Hmm,
what will ARF do now?

17:23.750 --> 17:28.208
(groans) I either need
a longer leg or a shorter neck.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.500
(beeps)

17:32.500 --> 17:36.208
Oh, no!
ARF didn't finish cleaning up
Bingo and Rolly's mess.

17:36.208 --> 17:37.875
Bingo and Who-sie's what?

17:39.458 --> 17:40.500
(screeches)

17:40.500 --> 17:42.250
Don't run away
from ARF.

17:42.250 --> 17:44.958
Sorry, running away from dogs
is just something cats do.

17:44.958 --> 17:47.333
(grunting)

17:47.333 --> 17:49.000
Leave me alone, dog-bot!

17:51.583 --> 17:54.250
-Whoa!
-Arf! Arf!
Arf! Arf!

17:55.416 --> 17:56.416
Whoa!

18:00.416 --> 18:02.166
-Arf! Arf! Arf! Arf!
-Yah!

18:08.333 --> 18:10.166
Wait! No!

18:10.166 --> 18:11.375
Wait!

18:11.375 --> 18:13.208
Have to finish the job!

18:13.208 --> 18:14.166
(whimpers) No!

18:16.416 --> 18:17.583
(beeping)

18:17.583 --> 18:19.166
(whirring)

18:22.500 --> 18:24.125
(belches)

18:24.125 --> 18:25.500
Excuse ARF.

18:25.500 --> 18:29.458
Oh. ARF is excused.

18:32.333 --> 18:33.416
(both yawning)

18:34.708 --> 18:36.583
Both:
Huh?

18:36.583 --> 18:38.583
What happened?

18:38.583 --> 18:40.708
Hissy and ARF made
a little bit of a mess.

18:40.708 --> 18:43.291
So how come
you're not cleaning it up?

18:43.291 --> 18:47.166
Because Bob only programmed
ARF to clean up after Bingo
and Rolly,

18:47.166 --> 18:50.000
not to clean up
after Hissy and ARF.

18:50.000 --> 18:53.208
But that means when Bob
gets home, he'll have
to clean up,

18:53.208 --> 18:55.416
and he won't have time
to play with us.

18:55.416 --> 18:58.125
Aw. ARF wishes ARF could help,

18:58.125 --> 19:00.750
but ARF wasn't programmed
to make wishes either.

19:00.750 --> 19:04.083
So I guess the two of us
are gonna have to clean
this place ourselves.

19:04.083 --> 19:05.708
Puppy-dog style!

19:05.708 --> 19:07.458
That sounds kind of fun.

19:07.458 --> 19:08.708
It's not gonna
be fun, Rolly.

19:08.708 --> 19:10.708
It's going to be work.

19:10.708 --> 19:12.208
It'll be a little bit
of fun.

19:14.375 --> 19:19.500
Both: ♪ Clean up time,
time to get everything
back the way it was before ♪

19:19.500 --> 19:25.166

19:52.750 --> 19:57.833

19:59.458 --> 20:02.250
Just gotta wash these towels
and our job is done.

20:03.500 --> 20:05.583
What are we gonna do
while they're washing?

20:08.458 --> 20:10.208
Both:
Doghouse!

20:12.958 --> 20:15.125
(burbling)

20:17.458 --> 20:21.208
Got it! Did it!
Crushed it!

20:23.375 --> 20:25.500
I'm gonna get you, turkey!

20:25.500 --> 20:28.291
(alarm chirping)

20:28.291 --> 20:31.458
Hey, Rolly!
It's almost time
for Bob to get home! Come on!

20:32.750 --> 20:34.750
(beeping)

20:34.750 --> 20:36.333
Boom! High score!

20:38.375 --> 20:39.708
Whoa!

20:39.708 --> 20:41.375
Hey!

20:42.708 --> 20:45.958
Both:
Whoa, whoa!

20:45.958 --> 20:50.500
Quick question.
How much soap did you put
in that washing machine?

20:50.500 --> 20:53.583
Um, all of it.

20:53.583 --> 20:56.500
We need to get
into the laundry room
and shut off the washing machine

20:56.500 --> 21:00.000
before things
get even soapier
and sudsier.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
-Whoa!
-(grunting)

21:02.000 --> 21:05.583
Look at me, Bingo!
Ho, ho, ho.

21:07.458 --> 21:08.458
(grunts)

21:10.208 --> 21:12.458
That looks like
a Rolly job.

21:14.083 --> 21:15.458
(grunts)

21:15.458 --> 21:17.583
-Just gotta
put your weight into it.
-(Bingo grunting)

21:20.458 --> 21:22.458
Both:
Tidal wave!

21:27.000 --> 21:29.583
-Rolly!
-Bingo?

21:29.583 --> 21:31.833
Bingo:
We need to get
to the top of the stairs!

21:31.833 --> 21:33.416
Rolly:
I'll meet you there!

21:39.583 --> 21:42.458
Pardon me.
Soapy cat coming through.

21:45.625 --> 21:47.166
(blowing)

21:47.166 --> 21:48.583
The soap suds
keep getting higher.

21:48.583 --> 21:50.583
But there's nowhere else
to go!

21:50.583 --> 21:53.208
Back, soapsuds,
get back!

21:53.208 --> 21:54.458
(hisses)

21:55.958 --> 21:57.500
Hissy! Look out!

21:57.500 --> 22:00.458
It's a googly green-eyed
soapsud monster!

22:00.458 --> 22:02.708
Stick together.
We'll be okay!

22:07.000 --> 22:10.208
-ARF?
-That's ARF's name.
Don't wear it ARF.

22:10.208 --> 22:13.583
ARF, we cleaned up
one mess, then we
made a bigger one!

22:13.583 --> 22:16.416
Well, if Bingo and Rolly
made this mess,

22:16.416 --> 22:18.416
ARF will clean it all up!

22:20.000 --> 22:22.458
(whirring)

22:22.458 --> 22:23.833
(grunting)

22:32.833 --> 22:35.458
(belches)
Excuse ARF.

22:35.458 --> 22:36.708
(laughing)

22:38.750 --> 22:40.833
Bob:
I'm home!

22:40.833 --> 22:42.333
Bingo/Rolly:
It's Bob!

22:42.333 --> 22:44.583
Bob, ARF cleaned up,
just like you made him to do!

22:44.583 --> 22:46.500
(barking)

22:46.500 --> 22:50.583
Wow! Look how sparkly
clean this place is!

22:50.583 --> 22:52.625
(sniffing)

22:52.625 --> 22:55.250
And it smells great!

22:55.250 --> 22:58.875
Like my clothes
right after they come
out of the washing machine. Ha!

23:00.000 --> 23:03.333
I guess my new invention
really worked, huh?

23:03.333 --> 23:06.625
Which means all of us
have more time to play!

23:06.625 --> 23:09.708
(barking)

23:09.708 --> 23:13.125
(giggling)

23:13.125 --> 23:15.625
