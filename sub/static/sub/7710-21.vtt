WEBVTT

00:04.777 --> 00:08.318
So, uh, have you found
a band yet for your wedding?

00:08.351 --> 00:10.589
No.
'Cause I'm in a band.

00:10.621 --> 00:12.426
We really rock.

00:12.458 --> 00:13.761
Yeah.
I mean, it's inevitable.

00:13.794 --> 00:15.631
I definitely overhear
some wedding preparation,

00:15.664 --> 00:17.069
but I'm fine with it.

00:17.103 --> 00:20.674
She hears me arranging
my social life,

00:20.709 --> 00:22.512
and we both have to hear
Dwight order deer urine

00:22.546 --> 00:23.814
over the Internet,

00:23.848 --> 00:25.451
so it evens out.

00:25.484 --> 00:27.455
So I got the Save The Date.
Yeah?

00:27.488 --> 00:28.457
Yeah, pretty stationery.

00:28.490 --> 00:30.162
Oh, thanks.

00:30.194 --> 00:32.166
I didn't get mine yet.

00:34.137 --> 00:35.172
Um...

00:35.205 --> 00:38.745
There are a few people
I decided not to invite,

00:38.778 --> 00:42.753
and that might make things
kind of awkward, but...

00:42.786 --> 00:44.790
it's my wedding.

00:44.822 --> 00:48.865
And I don't want anyone there
who has called me a hussy.

00:52.838 --> 01:02.425
*

01:20.994 --> 01:22.699
Yes, thanks.

01:22.733 --> 01:24.802
Fantastic Sams.
Adult cut plus.

01:24.837 --> 01:28.310
Comes with a shampoo
and blow-dry.

01:28.345 --> 01:29.980
We're doing I.D. photos today.

01:30.012 --> 01:31.984
Gotta represent.

01:32.016 --> 01:33.855
Uh, on or off?

01:33.888 --> 01:34.922
Off.

01:34.957 --> 01:36.361
Okay.

01:36.394 --> 01:38.930
Oh! What is on your face?

01:38.965 --> 01:41.503
Is that a disguise?

01:41.536 --> 01:42.706
Excuse me.

01:43.908 --> 01:45.812
Clown paint.

01:45.845 --> 01:47.416
I.D. badges are long overdue.

01:47.448 --> 01:49.787
Security in this office park
is a joke.

01:49.820 --> 01:53.495
Last year I came to work with
my spud gun in a duffel bag.

01:53.527 --> 01:56.934
I sat at my desk all day with
a rifle that shoots potatoes

01:56.966 --> 01:59.307
at 60 pounds per square inch.

01:59.340 --> 02:02.313
Can you imagine
if I was deranged?

02:02.346 --> 02:04.549
That's a nice tie.

02:06.621 --> 02:08.924
Thank you.
That is...

02:08.957 --> 02:10.762
Who makes that?
Um, I don't know.

02:10.794 --> 02:12.666
Do you mind if I wear that
for the photo?

02:12.698 --> 02:14.802
Uh, let's, um...

02:14.837 --> 02:16.973
Let's keep our clothes.

02:17.007 --> 02:19.880
It's like child abuse!

02:19.912 --> 02:23.052
I say if Jesus saw that,
he'd freak out!

02:23.086 --> 02:25.892
He'd freak out, Toby,
I mean, on so many levels.

02:25.924 --> 02:27.796
And I'm supposed to work there!
I'm supposed--

02:27.829 --> 02:29.699
What's the dealio?

02:29.732 --> 02:31.636
Just letting Oscar
vent a little.

02:31.671 --> 02:32.839
We would use the break room,

02:32.873 --> 02:34.343
but the photographer's
back there.

02:34.377 --> 02:35.345
What's the problem?

02:35.379 --> 02:36.381
Angela.

02:36.414 --> 02:37.214
There's just
a little dispute

02:37.247 --> 02:39.920
over a poster
in their workspace.

02:39.953 --> 02:41.424
Since Christmas.

02:41.457 --> 02:42.959
So what, you're having
a little spat?

02:42.993 --> 02:44.060
I forget.
Are you guys dating?

02:44.095 --> 02:45.664
No.

02:45.698 --> 02:48.938
Michael, can I talk to you
for a second, please?
Yes.

02:48.971 --> 02:50.509
Here's how
I usually handle this.

02:50.542 --> 02:51.844
All I do is listen.

02:51.877 --> 02:54.015
These things just have a way
of working themselves out.

02:54.048 --> 02:56.487
It's like if you
write someone a letter

02:56.521 --> 02:57.556
when you're really angry.

02:57.588 --> 02:59.560
They say to keep it in
your drawer for a couple days,

02:59.592 --> 03:01.696
and then you just never
end up sending it.

03:01.731 --> 03:03.800
What do you know about
conflict resolution?

03:03.835 --> 03:06.606
Your answer to everything
is to get divorced, so--

03:06.641 --> 03:07.975
Okay.
Okay, what?

03:08.009 --> 03:09.780
That was a right decision
for me and my marriage.

03:09.812 --> 03:12.117
Well, that's not gonna fly here
because in this office,

03:12.150 --> 03:13.820
it is till death do us part,

03:13.855 --> 03:15.824
assuming that we don't
get downsized.

03:15.859 --> 03:18.698
Uh, Pam,
would you get Angela

03:18.730 --> 03:21.168
and meet us in
the conference room, please?

03:21.203 --> 03:24.577
A Mediator's Toolchest.

03:26.213 --> 03:28.850
Okay, well,
before we get started,

03:28.884 --> 03:30.621
you should know
that there are

03:30.655 --> 03:33.727
five different styles
of conflict.

03:33.760 --> 03:37.802
My Shaolin Temple style
defeats your Monkey style.

03:37.835 --> 03:39.640
Can we go?
I have a lot of work to do.

03:39.672 --> 03:40.942
No. This is important.

03:40.975 --> 03:43.146
Okay, the first style is
"lose-lose."

03:43.178 --> 03:46.920
What's the next one?
Just hold on, please.

03:46.954 --> 03:49.225
Okay, if we do lose-lose,

03:49.258 --> 03:52.164
neither of you
gets what you want.

03:52.196 --> 03:53.467
Do you understand?

03:56.005 --> 03:58.176
You would both lose.

03:58.208 --> 03:59.846
Now, I need to ask you,

03:59.879 --> 04:04.221
do you want to pursue
a lose

04:04.255 --> 04:07.160
Can we just skip
to whatever number five is?

04:07.194 --> 04:08.597
Win

04:08.630 --> 04:10.969
Win-win is number four,

04:11.002 --> 04:13.908
and number five is
win-win-win.

04:13.940 --> 04:15.812
The important difference
here is

04:15.845 --> 04:17.948
with win-win-win,
we all win.

04:17.982 --> 04:21.557
Me too. I win for having
successfully mediated

04:21.591 --> 04:23.794
a conflict at work.

04:23.828 --> 04:26.966
Okay, so this is
the disputed poster.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.038
Now, one at a time,

04:29.071 --> 04:31.943
I want you
to express your feelings

04:31.976 --> 04:35.083
using "I" emotion language

04:35.117 --> 04:38.625
and no judging,
or "you" statements.

04:38.658 --> 04:40.227
I got this poster
for Christmas,

04:40.260 --> 04:42.699
and I feel I want
to see it every day.

04:42.733 --> 04:45.938
It makes me feel like the
babies are the true artists,

04:45.971 --> 04:48.008
and God has a really cute
sense of humor.

04:48.042 --> 04:49.145
Come on, seriously.
That?

04:49.178 --> 04:50.948
I don't like looking at it.

04:50.981 --> 04:54.121
It's creepy and in bad taste,
and it's just offensive to me.

04:54.155 --> 04:57.261
It makes me think of the
horrible, frigid stage mothers

04:57.294 --> 04:58.930
who forced the babies
into it.

04:58.964 --> 05:00.601
It's kitsch.
It's the opposite of art.

05:00.601 --> 05:03.808
It destroys art.
It destroys souls.

05:03.841 --> 05:05.911
This is so much more offensive
to me than hard-core porno.

05:05.945 --> 05:07.213
Okay, okay, okay!
Oh, my God.

05:07.247 --> 05:08.951
Stop, stop, stop!

05:08.985 --> 05:11.221
Let's see if we can't
just brainstorm

05:11.254 --> 05:14.662
and find some creative
alternatives that are win-win.

05:14.697 --> 05:16.399
Win.
Yes.
Thank you, Pam.

05:16.433 --> 05:20.173
How about Angela makes
the poster into a t-shirt,

05:20.207 --> 05:22.144
which Oscar wears.

05:22.177 --> 05:23.948
That way
he can never see it,

05:23.980 --> 05:26.185
and whenever
she looks at Oscar,

05:26.219 --> 05:27.956
she c see it.

05:27.988 --> 05:29.425
Win-win-win.

05:29.459 --> 05:31.697
No.
That's--
No.

05:31.731 --> 05:32.998
Okay, well, brainstorm.
Own the solution.

05:33.032 --> 05:34.937
How about
I leave it up?

05:34.969 --> 05:36.138
How about
she takes it down?

05:36.172 --> 05:39.010
How about Angela
can keep it up

05:39.044 --> 05:41.114
on Tuesdays
and Thursdays.
Okay.

05:41.148 --> 05:44.087
That is called a compromise,

05:44.120 --> 05:46.158
and it is style three,

05:46.192 --> 05:47.227
and it is not ideal.

05:47.261 --> 05:48.364
To sum up,

05:48.397 --> 05:51.134
win-win, make the poster
into a t-shirt.

05:51.168 --> 05:53.775
Win-lose,
take the poster down.

05:53.808 --> 05:55.411
Compromise,
Tuesdays and Thursdays.

05:55.443 --> 05:57.382
And the answer is...

05:58.885 --> 06:00.721
make the poster
into a t-shirt.

06:00.721 --> 06:02.291
Win-win.
Win.

06:02.324 --> 06:03.326
Fine.
But--

06:03.359 --> 06:05.999
It is done!

06:08.103 --> 06:09.405
No, you're all good.

06:09.438 --> 06:11.209
Great.

06:15.150 --> 06:18.925
Hey, Angela.
I didn't have your zip code.

06:18.957 --> 06:21.362
Oh, thanks.

06:22.833 --> 06:24.368
It was hand-delivered,

06:24.401 --> 06:27.843
but I did get
a Save The Date after all.

06:27.876 --> 06:29.979
It's not my taste.

06:30.013 --> 06:31.082
You solved it.

06:31.114 --> 06:32.216
Yes.

06:32.250 --> 06:35.390
Well, good.
We can throw that one out.

06:36.961 --> 06:38.564
Are those
all the other complaints?
Mm-hmm.

06:38.596 --> 06:39.967
I would like to see those,
please.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.971
I--I can't do that.

06:42.004 --> 06:45.109
You can't do that, huh?
Okay.

06:45.142 --> 06:47.081
Now you and I have
a conflict.

06:47.113 --> 06:49.150
I order you
to give me that file.

06:49.184 --> 06:51.188
That--

06:51.221 --> 06:54.127
Okay.

06:55.129 --> 06:57.435
There!
No more conflict.

06:57.468 --> 07:00.007
I had to use win-lose on that.
It was not pretty.

07:00.040 --> 07:01.910
All right.
Is that it?

07:08.456 --> 07:10.059
It's all Dwight's.

07:10.093 --> 07:11.596
Every Friday at 4:00,

07:11.629 --> 07:13.398
I have a standing appointment
with Dwight

07:13.433 --> 07:15.671
for him to file a grievance
against Jim.

07:15.704 --> 07:17.140
I tell him
that I'm sending them

07:17.174 --> 07:19.077
to a special file
in New York.

07:19.111 --> 07:20.279
That box is the...

07:20.312 --> 07:21.984
Special file
in New York.

07:22.016 --> 07:24.622
Oh, God.
All right.

07:24.655 --> 07:27.061
Why do I have to do everything?

07:27.093 --> 07:28.095
Are you sure?

07:28.129 --> 07:30.935
Oh, he's sure.
Just shoot.

07:34.441 --> 07:36.278
This is from Kevin.

07:36.311 --> 07:39.953
He says Stanley uses his
Miracle Whip without asking.

07:39.987 --> 07:43.059
Meredith complains that
everyone talks too loud

07:43.093 --> 07:44.128
in the morning,

07:44.160 --> 07:46.032
and the lights
are too bright.

07:46.065 --> 07:49.304
Creed--

07:49.337 --> 07:52.176
Creed is sick of looking
at the redhead all day

07:52.211 --> 07:55.349
and wants a seat facing
the receptionist.

07:55.382 --> 07:57.154
Nice.

07:57.186 --> 08:00.961
You will notice that not one of
these complaints is against me.

08:00.961 --> 08:02.765
Actually,
I have a separate folder

08:02.798 --> 08:05.103
for complaints against Michael.

08:05.136 --> 08:11.081
This is January through March
of this year.

08:13.686 --> 08:16.692
How many of you
have at one time

08:16.726 --> 08:19.464
gone to Toby to complain
about another employee?

08:22.171 --> 08:23.373
And did you get
what you wanted,

08:23.405 --> 08:27.047
or were you merely listened to,
you forget about your problem,

08:27.081 --> 08:27.882
and you move on?

08:27.914 --> 08:31.789
That is outrageous!

08:31.823 --> 08:33.425
I love this place,

08:33.458 --> 08:35.396
and it pains me to see

08:35.429 --> 08:39.806
all of the negativity
festering--

08:39.838 --> 08:41.007
Okay.

08:41.041 --> 08:45.584
Today we are going to get
everything out of these files

08:45.618 --> 08:48.557
and into the open,
where it can be resolved.

08:48.590 --> 08:51.730
All right, how about
the Phyllis

08:51.763 --> 08:53.099
You already did me.

08:53.133 --> 08:54.801
That's what she said.

08:54.836 --> 08:55.803
The thing is, Angela,

08:55.838 --> 08:59.145
you are in here
an awful lot.

08:59.178 --> 09:00.748
You have complained
about everybody in the office,

09:00.781 --> 09:03.319
except Dwight,
which is odd

09:03.352 --> 09:05.823
because everyone else has
had run-ins with Dwight.

09:05.858 --> 09:08.328
Toby, by the way,
what does "redacted" mean?

09:08.363 --> 09:10.366
There is a file full
of complaints in here

09:10.400 --> 09:11.802
marked "redacted."

09:11.836 --> 09:12.905
Yeah, it just means
whoever complained

09:12.938 --> 09:14.374
came to me later
and withdrew it,

09:14.408 --> 09:15.844
so I took their name off.

09:15.877 --> 09:17.246
Okay.

09:17.281 --> 09:19.751
There were a bunch of complaints
about Dwight

09:19.786 --> 09:22.291
that were put in the redacted
file about six months ago.

09:22.323 --> 09:23.091
Wait!

09:23.125 --> 09:24.862
If someone has
a problem with me,

09:24.895 --> 09:27.167
why would they withdraw it
six months ago?

09:29.672 --> 09:32.577
Um...
Let's move on.

09:32.611 --> 09:33.847
I volunteer.

09:33.879 --> 09:35.382
Did anyone have a problem
with me?

09:35.417 --> 09:38.223
All right, Pamela.
Come on down!

09:38.256 --> 09:39.926
Let's do it.

09:39.958 --> 09:43.233
And...okay.
Just one complaint.

09:43.266 --> 09:45.804
Actually, it has been withdrawn.

09:45.838 --> 09:46.873
So that is no help to us.

09:46.905 --> 09:48.909
Next.
Wait, what did it say?

09:48.944 --> 09:51.950
Uh, "Does she have to plan
her wedding on office time?

09:51.982 --> 09:52.852
Shouldn't she do that
at home?"

09:54.722 --> 09:56.760
Who else?

09:56.793 --> 09:58.428
Why don't we just
warm up first?

09:58.463 --> 09:59.899
Warm up emotionally,
all right?

09:59.931 --> 10:03.439
I have this kind of big secret
about Angela.

10:03.472 --> 10:04.741
And I've been
really nice to her,

10:04.776 --> 10:06.679
and I haven't told anyone,
and...

10:06.713 --> 10:07.814
What the hell?!

10:07.848 --> 10:10.486
Here is a Kelly complaint.

10:10.520 --> 10:12.657
"Ryan never returns
my calls."

10:12.692 --> 10:14.561
Ah.
Join the club.

10:14.595 --> 10:16.932
My voice mail's
real spotty...sometimes.

10:16.966 --> 10:19.938
I didn't file a complaint.
I was just talking.

10:19.972 --> 10:21.441
To your HR representative.

10:21.475 --> 10:22.812
To my friend,
I thought.

10:22.845 --> 10:24.514
I want that withdrawn.

10:24.548 --> 10:25.984
Fine, I'll take your name off.

10:26.017 --> 10:27.554
So no one will know.

10:29.691 --> 10:30.960
Making progress.

10:30.994 --> 10:32.497
Yes.
Dwight tried to kiss me.

10:32.530 --> 10:33.900
What?
And I didn't tell anyone

10:33.934 --> 10:35.502
'cause I'm not really sure
how I feel about it.

10:35.537 --> 10:37.942
That is not true.
Redact it. Redact it!

10:37.975 --> 10:39.645
Well, I'm not actually making
a formal complaint.

10:39.678 --> 10:41.449
I just really think
we should talk about it.

10:41.482 --> 10:42.484
Okay, question.

10:42.516 --> 10:44.355
When a name is withdrawn,
does that also apply

10:44.388 --> 10:46.524
to the permanent
misbehavior file in New York?

10:46.559 --> 10:48.696
Sure.

10:48.729 --> 10:51.435
Stanley.

10:51.469 --> 10:52.805
Hey.
A lot of anger under there...

10:52.838 --> 10:54.508
Thanks for ratting me out.

10:54.540 --> 10:55.542
I didn't do it.

10:55.577 --> 10:56.679
I find that hard to believe,

10:56.712 --> 10:59.650
considering you have problems
with every single person

10:59.685 --> 11:01.321
in this entire office
except Bobblehead Joe.

11:02.857 --> 11:06.465
Someone complained
that the men's room

11:06.498 --> 11:08.134
is "whites only."

11:08.168 --> 11:10.005
Stanley, you know
that's not true.

11:10.038 --> 11:11.843
I didn't say that.

11:11.875 --> 11:15.549
Then why is there a picture
of a white man on the door?

11:18.924 --> 11:20.026
Okay, Phyllis.

11:20.058 --> 11:22.797
You complained that Angela
is giving you dirty looks.

11:22.831 --> 11:24.969
And you tried to get off
the party planning committee.

11:25.001 --> 11:26.839
No, I never said
any such thing.

11:26.873 --> 11:28.508
Angela and I are close.

11:28.543 --> 11:29.811
And...also, Phyllis,

11:29.845 --> 11:32.817
Stanley says that you
cry too much,

11:32.851 --> 11:33.853
and that bugs him.

11:33.887 --> 11:35.523
Stanley and I
are close, too.

11:35.557 --> 11:38.429
We sit close.
Okaaay.

11:40.467 --> 11:43.005
Just take it.

11:43.038 --> 11:45.710
I can't believe Angela.

11:45.743 --> 11:47.013
I went against
my better judgment,

11:47.046 --> 11:48.816
and I gave her
a Save The Date.

11:48.849 --> 11:51.021
And now it turns out
she complained about me to Toby.

11:51.054 --> 11:52.691
Well, it was redacted.

11:53.826 --> 11:55.096
Look, if she wants an invite,

11:55.129 --> 11:56.799
maybe she's just trying
to be friends.

11:56.832 --> 11:58.736
Don't take her side.

12:01.108 --> 12:02.777
Well, what does Roy think
about everything?

12:02.812 --> 12:03.846
I don't know.

12:03.879 --> 12:04.816
I try not to bother him
about this kind of stuff.

12:04.848 --> 12:07.553
You mean like your thoughts
and feelings?

12:07.587 --> 12:09.826
Yeah.

12:09.859 --> 12:11.763
I know you keep saying
it's your space,

12:11.796 --> 12:12.832
even though
there's no assigned parking,

12:12.865 --> 12:13.934
but I keep forgetting.

12:13.967 --> 12:15.502
Yes, that's the problem.

12:15.537 --> 12:17.673
I guess so.

12:17.707 --> 12:21.850
Okay, well.
All settled, then.

12:21.882 --> 12:24.186
I don't like you.

12:24.220 --> 12:26.190
Okay, Ryan,
you told Toby

12:26.224 --> 12:31.870
that Creed has a distinct
old man smell?

12:31.902 --> 12:34.040
I know exactly
what he's talking about.

12:34.074 --> 12:36.211
I sprout mung beans
on a damp paper towel

12:36.243 --> 12:37.581
in my desk drawer.

12:37.614 --> 12:38.949
Very nutritious.

12:38.983 --> 12:40.687
But they smell like death.

12:40.720 --> 12:42.056
All right, Kevin.

12:42.090 --> 12:42.957
You are accused of making

12:42.991 --> 12:45.597
sexually suggestive
remarks to Angela

12:45.630 --> 12:47.166
that made her feel
uncomfortable.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.836
Solution.

12:48.869 --> 12:50.172
Angela,
you are to make

12:50.206 --> 12:52.043
sexually suggestive
remarks to Kevin

12:52.076 --> 12:53.078
that will make him
uncomfortable.

12:53.112 --> 12:55.783
I accept your decision.

12:55.818 --> 12:57.854
Hey, you know what,
Dwight?

12:57.887 --> 13:00.159
Maybe we should get
our photo I.D. taken together.

13:00.192 --> 13:01.561
That doesn't make
any sense.

13:01.561 --> 13:03.132
Well, it saves time,
you know.

13:03.165 --> 13:04.300
'Cause we could just meet

13:04.333 --> 13:05.335
in the parking lot
every morning.

13:05.368 --> 13:07.005
Walk in together.
Perfect.

13:07.039 --> 13:08.007
Smile.

13:08.041 --> 13:10.046
No.

13:10.079 --> 13:11.347
I never smile
if I can help it.

13:11.381 --> 13:12.616
Showing one's teeth

13:12.651 --> 13:14.655
is a submission signal
in primates.

13:14.687 --> 13:16.758
When someone smiles at me,
all I see

13:16.791 --> 13:19.998
is a chimpanzee
begging for its life.

13:21.334 --> 13:24.006
This came out really well.

13:24.039 --> 13:25.342
There you go.

13:30.051 --> 13:31.320
This is humongous.

13:31.354 --> 13:33.324
I am not a security threat.
Oh.

13:33.358 --> 13:35.730
And my middle name is Kurt.

13:35.763 --> 13:37.200
Not Fart.

13:37.233 --> 13:39.771
What did I write?

13:42.243 --> 13:44.881
I have another complaint
for Jim's permanent file.

13:44.916 --> 13:47.887
Talk to Michael.
I gave him the box.

13:47.922 --> 13:49.056
What box?

13:51.829 --> 13:53.031
But I didn't report
your snoring--
Wednesdays, tearful.

13:53.064 --> 13:56.338
Tuesdays--
Okay.

13:56.371 --> 13:59.009
Ah--agh--dgh--
dah!
Dwight.

13:59.043 --> 14:01.681
No, no!

14:01.681 --> 14:03.185
Four years of malfeasance
unreported.

14:03.217 --> 14:04.922
This cannot stand.
Okay.
Calm down.

14:04.955 --> 14:06.791
No, you calm down.
Whose side is Toby on?

14:06.825 --> 14:07.727
Whose side are you on?!

14:07.761 --> 14:09.097
Hey, hey!
Him or me?

14:09.129 --> 14:10.331
Him or me?

14:10.365 --> 14:11.902
I cannot work
with Jim anymore.
Okay.

14:11.936 --> 14:12.871
Either he goes,
or I go.

14:12.904 --> 14:13.838
Dwight, stop--
You choose!

14:13.873 --> 14:18.481
One of us is out of here
by the end of today.

14:20.151 --> 14:22.757
Okay.

14:24.426 --> 14:25.396
I am not bluffing!

14:25.428 --> 14:26.832
Okay, yes.
Okay?

14:26.864 --> 14:27.934
Do the right thing here,
Michael.

14:27.968 --> 14:30.239
I have served you loyally
for years.

14:30.272 --> 14:32.243
I deserve this,
you know I do!

14:34.014 --> 14:37.787
You know your I.D. says
you're a security threat?

14:37.821 --> 14:40.058
You have till 5:00.

14:43.833 --> 14:45.870
Oh, look, Jim.

14:45.904 --> 14:49.377
There's a sales manager
position open in Stamford.

14:49.410 --> 14:52.350
Want me to call Jan
and tell her you're interested?

14:52.383 --> 14:54.519
I could put in
a good word for you.

14:54.554 --> 14:56.324
'Cause I'll still
be working here.

14:56.358 --> 14:59.464
Trans-fer,
trans-fer--Everybody.

14:59.497 --> 15:01.801
Trans-fer, trans-fer
trans-fer!

15:01.801 --> 15:06.043
Okay, you two,
in the conference room, with me.

15:06.078 --> 15:09.184
Nobody leaves until
we work this out.

15:09.217 --> 15:11.889
Cage match.

15:11.922 --> 15:13.325
Cage matches?
Yeah, they work.

15:13.357 --> 15:14.593
How could they not work?

15:14.627 --> 15:15.461
If they didn't work,

15:15.495 --> 15:18.034
everybody would still
be in the cage.

15:18.068 --> 15:19.905
Okay, so, Dwight,
in your own words.

15:19.939 --> 15:23.012
"Someone replaced all my pens
and pencils with crayons.

15:23.044 --> 15:25.149
I suspect Jim Halpert."

15:25.181 --> 15:27.887
"Everyone has
called me Dwayne all day.

15:27.921 --> 15:30.392
I think Jim Halpert
paid them to."

15:31.428 --> 15:33.631
Yes, five bucks each.

15:33.665 --> 15:35.335
And it was totally worth it.

15:35.369 --> 15:38.475
"This morning I found a bloody
glove in my desk drawer,

15:38.508 --> 15:41.014
"and Jim Halpert
tried to convince me

15:41.048 --> 15:41.983
"I committed murder.

15:42.016 --> 15:44.319
I think he may be
the real murderer."

15:44.353 --> 15:46.658
"Jim Halpert said there was
an abandoned infant

15:46.690 --> 15:47.660
"in the women's room.

15:47.692 --> 15:49.430
"When I went
to save the child,

15:49.464 --> 15:50.933
I saw Meredith on the can."

15:50.968 --> 15:52.570
Gad.

15:52.603 --> 15:58.415
"This morning I knocked myself
in the head with the phone."

16:00.052 --> 16:01.521
That actually took a while.

16:01.554 --> 16:04.226
I had to put more and more
nickels into his handset,

16:04.260 --> 16:05.998
till he got used
to the weight,

16:06.030 --> 16:08.970
and then I just...
took 'em all out.

16:09.004 --> 16:11.241
"Every time I typed my name

16:11.274 --> 16:12.977
it said Diapers."

16:14.314 --> 16:16.684
Just a simple macro.

16:16.717 --> 16:19.992
You know, these actually
don't sound that funny

16:20.026 --> 16:20.994
one after another.

16:21.028 --> 16:23.265
But he does deserve it, though.

16:23.297 --> 16:24.767
"By the end of the day,

16:24.799 --> 16:28.208
my desk was about two feet
closer to the copier."

16:28.241 --> 16:30.279
Yeah, I just moved it
an inch

16:30.311 --> 16:33.117
every time he went
to the bathroom.

16:33.152 --> 16:35.455
And that's how I spent
my entire day that day.

16:58.834 --> 17:02.042
The Japanese have this thing
called shiatsu massage,

17:02.042 --> 17:06.384
where they dig into your body,
very hard.

17:06.418 --> 17:07.652
And it is very painful.

17:07.686 --> 17:09.789
And apparently,
some people throw up.

17:09.824 --> 17:12.396
But the next day
they feel great.

17:12.430 --> 17:14.467
I've never had one.

17:14.499 --> 17:16.138
They sound awful.

17:22.183 --> 17:23.818
Maybe Stamford
would be cool.

17:26.290 --> 17:29.164
It's a good market.

17:29.197 --> 17:30.399
Higher volume.

17:30.431 --> 17:34.140
Yeah.

17:34.174 --> 17:35.408
Maybe we should both go.

17:35.441 --> 17:37.680
I have a girlfriend.

17:37.713 --> 17:39.717
Sure, you do, Dwight. Sure.

17:39.750 --> 17:43.491
Hey, there's, like,
300 more of these.

17:43.524 --> 17:44.760
Let's get to them later.

17:44.794 --> 17:46.597
So, you gonna
transfer Jim or not?

17:46.631 --> 17:48.835
Maybe. I haven't decided yet.

17:48.867 --> 17:49.837
Let's get to work.

17:49.869 --> 17:51.408
I want an answer
by tomorrow.

17:51.440 --> 17:54.814
Okay--ooh, actually,
tomorrow's not good.

17:54.847 --> 17:57.220
How about later in the week?

17:57.253 --> 17:58.722
Fine.

17:58.755 --> 18:01.194
Good. Okay.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.337
Hey! Wait.

18:06.371 --> 18:09.276
How about a group picture
while you're here?

18:09.310 --> 18:11.414
I can't. I only get reimbursed
for the I.D. photos.

18:11.447 --> 18:13.418
Well, that's, what,
a computer camera, right?

18:13.451 --> 18:14.786
You mean, digital?

18:14.819 --> 18:16.790
Yeah, it'll take, like,
two seconds.

18:16.823 --> 18:18.762
20 bucks.

18:18.795 --> 18:20.598
All right.

18:20.631 --> 18:23.938
Everybody, come on.
Group photo for the newsletter.

18:23.971 --> 18:25.776
You've gotta be kidding.

18:25.809 --> 18:27.545
Come on, everybody.
Come on, let's go.

18:27.580 --> 18:30.786
Creed, Kevin, Oscar,
andale, let's go.

18:30.819 --> 18:33.357
One, two, three.
Smile.

18:33.392 --> 18:34.894
Try to smile.

18:34.927 --> 18:35.961
We resolved a lot today,
everybody.

18:35.996 --> 18:36.798
Think happy thoughts.

18:36.831 --> 18:38.467
Okay, I'm just gonna
take it on three,

18:38.502 --> 18:39.737
whether you smile or not.

18:39.770 --> 18:40.872
One, two, three.

18:40.906 --> 18:42.776
Good. Let's check that out.

18:42.810 --> 18:45.449
Ew, okay, all right.

18:45.481 --> 18:46.951
One more.
We'll take one more.

18:46.983 --> 18:47.920
That'll be another 20.

18:47.953 --> 18:49.524
What?

18:49.556 --> 18:51.761
Angela, I want to talk
to you about something.
What?

18:51.794 --> 18:52.863
No, Pam--
I am.

18:52.896 --> 18:54.566
It's about
the Save The Date--

18:54.599 --> 18:55.869
Pam, it wasn't her.
What?

18:57.473 --> 18:59.042
I'm the one
who complained about you.

19:01.111 --> 19:04.920
I didn't know that Toby
was gonna write it down.

19:04.953 --> 19:07.326
I was just venting.

19:07.360 --> 19:09.364
You know, it was one day.

19:09.396 --> 19:10.866
And I took it right back.

19:10.898 --> 19:12.502
It was like--

19:14.739 --> 19:15.709
Okay.

19:15.741 --> 19:17.010
Oh, dear.

19:20.016 --> 19:22.923
Okay...we can do this.

19:22.955 --> 19:24.024
Come on, everybody.

19:26.398 --> 19:27.900
All right.

19:27.933 --> 19:29.302
Here we go.

19:29.336 --> 19:33.109
It was really hard getting
a good picture of 15 people.

19:33.143 --> 19:34.880
He would not give me
a discount.

19:34.914 --> 19:36.851
And eight tries added up.

19:36.884 --> 19:39.457
One, two--

19:39.490 --> 19:40.992
Didn't say three, did I?

19:41.026 --> 19:43.831
But I'm sort of an expert
at Photoshop.

19:43.865 --> 19:45.835
So it turned out fine
in the end.

19:45.869 --> 19:47.440
When people work together,

19:47.473 --> 19:49.042
there is going
to be conflict.

19:49.075 --> 19:51.481
You can't outrun
your problems.

19:51.514 --> 19:53.050
Hey, Pam, it's Jim.

19:53.083 --> 19:55.522
Um, I have a doctor's
appointment in the city.

19:55.556 --> 19:57.825
So I probably won't be in
till the late afternoon.

19:57.859 --> 20:00.899
Just thought I'd let ya know.
Okay, bye.

20:00.932 --> 20:02.402
Okay, Jan will see you now.

20:02.402 --> 20:04.005
Oh, thanks.

20:04.038 --> 20:07.010
And that is why the idea
of a cage match

20:07.044 --> 20:09.716
is so universally
appealing.

20:09.750 --> 20:11.953
But here's the thing
about cage matches.

20:11.988 --> 20:15.662
Sometimes you have
to open the cage.

20:15.695 --> 20:21.006
And that is something that Toby
will never understand.

20:34.132 --> 20:36.136
