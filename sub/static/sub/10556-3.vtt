00:48.314 --> 00:49.975
That's it, Amos.

00:51.384 --> 00:52.942
Let's go.
Keep those hands high.

00:54.187 --> 00:56.348
Whack him, whack him.

01:05.598 --> 01:07.225
That's it, that's it!

01:16.843 --> 01:19.243
Okay, you've given them
30 rounds.

01:20.480 --> 01:22.004
Time to end it.
Right?

01:22.082 --> 01:24.846
Okay.
Let's go, Amos.

01:28.188 --> 01:29.655
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!

01:29.722 --> 01:30.950
You're supposed to go down.

01:31.024 --> 01:33.356
Stand up
and make this look good.

01:33.426 --> 01:35.257
Let's go. Let's go, Amos.
Let's go, Amos.

01:35.328 --> 01:36.420
Okay, boy.
Go on.

01:39.899 --> 01:41.389
Oh!

01:59.586 --> 02:00.575
Oh!

02:16.402 --> 02:17.528
Mr. Robinson.

02:17.604 --> 02:19.629
Mr. Robinson,
a picture for The Gazette?

02:20.840 --> 02:21.829
Lovely.

02:25.445 --> 02:27.879
Name is Amos Robinson.
Paid fighter.

02:27.947 --> 02:29.414
I take it he fought tonight.

02:29.482 --> 02:31.643
30 rounds with Bob Sullivan.

02:32.919 --> 02:34.079
Powder burns.

02:34.154 --> 02:36.088
Did you recover
the murder weapon?

02:36.156 --> 02:38.886
Yes, sir.
A derringer.

02:41.361 --> 02:42.692
How old is the queen this year?

02:43.763 --> 02:45.060
76, I believe.

02:45.131 --> 02:46.792
When my grandmother turned 76,

02:46.866 --> 02:48.333
I got her some oranges.

02:48.401 --> 02:49.698
They were quite juicy.

02:49.769 --> 02:52.294
But all this fireworks business
makes me wonder

02:52.372 --> 02:55.637
if I should have done
something more.

02:57.443 --> 02:58.842
What are you measuring, sir?

02:58.912 --> 03:00.709
The length and the width
of the barrel.

03:00.780 --> 03:03.180
To determine the spread
of the powder.

03:03.249 --> 03:04.341
I'm trying to estimate

03:04.417 --> 03:07.113
how close the victim was
to the perpetrator.

03:07.187 --> 03:09.485
How close was he?

03:09.556 --> 03:10.750
It's hard to tell.

03:10.823 --> 03:12.620
But as close as 18 inches,
I believe.

03:12.692 --> 03:15.786
- Where is the accused?
- Just down the hall.

03:15.862 --> 03:17.523
Sir, the front desk clerk
found her

03:17.597 --> 03:19.326
standing over the body,
gun in hand.

03:19.399 --> 03:21.264
- Stop her!
- No! No!

03:21.334 --> 03:23.427
I didn't kill him!
You have to believe me!

03:23.503 --> 03:24.435
No! Aah!

03:24.504 --> 03:26.404
Sorry, sir.
She's a slippery one.

03:26.472 --> 03:28.667
I didn't do it!
I didn't kill him!

03:28.741 --> 03:29.799
You have to believe me!

03:31.544 --> 03:33.307
Fleeing custody to boot.

03:33.379 --> 03:35.472
This one is as guilty
as they come, sir.

03:35.548 --> 03:37.573
She may be guilty
of some things, George.

03:37.650 --> 03:40.483
But shooting Amos Robinson
isn't one of them.

03:46.559 --> 03:48.925
I was at my desk
when I heard a scream.

03:48.995 --> 03:50.622
It was long and intense.

03:50.697 --> 03:53.962
I- It raised the hair
on the back of my neck.

03:54.033 --> 03:56.467
And when was this
in relation to the shot?

03:59.172 --> 04:01.037
You heard a scream.
You must have heard a shot.

04:01.107 --> 04:03.940
I could have mistaken it
for a firecracker, I suppose.

04:04.010 --> 04:06.035
They've been going off
all night.

04:06.112 --> 04:09.206
Thank you.
You've been most helpful.

04:19.692 --> 04:21.683
He's a boxer.
Fought this evening.

04:21.761 --> 04:23.160
Yes, I can see that.

04:23.229 --> 04:24.958
He's quite the physical
specimen, isn't he?

04:25.031 --> 04:26.828
Look at the size of his arms.

04:28.167 --> 04:30.431
- What time did the fight end?
- Around 8:00.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.068
And when was he shot?

04:33.139 --> 04:36.233
Half past 11:00 or thereabouts.
What are you thinking?

04:36.309 --> 04:37.503
His nose is broken.

04:37.577 --> 04:38.942
I would expect to see
more swelling

04:39.012 --> 04:40.445
in the intervening hours.

04:40.513 --> 04:42.947
Perhaps it was broken
after the fight?

04:43.016 --> 04:44.540
That would be one explanation.

04:44.617 --> 04:45.845
Shot at very close range.

04:45.918 --> 04:47.715
Directly in the heart,
it would seem.

04:47.787 --> 04:49.311
I'll know more
when I can open him up.

04:49.389 --> 04:51.516
- Am I free to take the body?
- Yes.

04:51.591 --> 04:53.923
George, make sure
no one steps in this blood.

04:53.993 --> 04:54.982
Sir.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.399
George.

05:03.202 --> 05:04.533
Where's the accused now?

05:04.604 --> 05:06.265
Uh, room at the end
of the hall, sir.

05:06.339 --> 05:07.772
You've done
a preliminary interview?

05:07.840 --> 05:09.831
Yes, sir.
Here are my notes.

05:09.909 --> 05:11.376
Sir, you still haven't told me

05:11.444 --> 05:14.004
why you think Mrs. Robinson
is innocent.

05:14.080 --> 05:16.844
Newton's third law of motion,
George.

05:22.755 --> 05:24.552
Are you going to run again?

05:25.758 --> 05:27.988
Thank you, Constable.
You can step out.

05:31.431 --> 05:33.558
Mrs. Robinson, I need your help.

05:33.633 --> 05:34.861
My help?

05:34.934 --> 05:36.561
I'm trying to find
your husband's killer.

05:36.636 --> 05:39.400
- Aren't you looking at her?
- I don't know. Am I?

05:39.472 --> 05:41.372
What does it matter?

05:41.441 --> 05:44.035
- They're gonna hang me anyway.
- Maybe you're right.

05:44.110 --> 05:46.738
Personally, I have somewhat
of an obsession for the truth.

05:46.813 --> 05:48.576
However, if it's
of no consequence...

05:48.648 --> 05:49.774
Good luck to you.

05:49.849 --> 05:51.282
What? Hey.

05:51.351 --> 05:53.251
Hey!
You're just gonna walk away?

05:53.319 --> 05:55.150
I have a murder to solve.

05:55.221 --> 05:56.654
If you are unwilling
to help me...

05:56.756 --> 05:58.189
I didn't say that.

05:58.224 --> 06:01.250
But a police officer
helping a colored woman...

06:01.327 --> 06:03.887
That hasn't been my experience.

06:12.772 --> 06:14.364
Have a seat.

06:16.342 --> 06:18.003
You say that you left
the boxing match

06:18.077 --> 06:20.944
in the company
of your husband, Amos,

06:21.013 --> 06:23.379
his manager, Ozzie Beers,

06:23.449 --> 06:26.646
and you went to the Mockingbird
Tavern on Queen Street

06:26.719 --> 06:28.914
in the company of an unknown man
and his wife.

06:28.988 --> 06:31.013
Ozzie knew them.
I didn't.

06:31.090 --> 06:34.150
You then left the bar
with Ozzie Beers.

06:34.227 --> 06:36.286
- Why not your husband?
- He was busy.

06:36.362 --> 06:37.989
Doing what?

06:38.064 --> 06:40.965
Drinking.
Running around.

06:42.402 --> 06:45.337
So you returned to the hotel.
What happened then?

06:45.405 --> 06:48.932
Ozzie went to his room,
and I went to mine.

06:49.008 --> 06:50.134
A little while later,

06:50.209 --> 06:52.234
the fireworks started going off
down by the harbor,

06:52.311 --> 06:54.609
so I went to the roof to look.

06:54.680 --> 06:56.443
It was like the Fourth of July.

06:56.516 --> 06:58.814
You then returned to your room
at half past 11:00,

06:58.918 --> 07:02.046
whereupon you found the body.

07:02.088 --> 07:03.180
What did you do?

07:03.256 --> 07:05.486
I screamed.

07:05.558 --> 07:07.992
At least I think I screamed.

07:08.060 --> 07:11.223
And then I got down on my knees
to see if he was alive.

07:11.297 --> 07:13.197
Is that how you got blood
on your dress?

07:14.700 --> 07:16.292
I guess so.

07:16.369 --> 07:20.465
And then I-I saw the gun lying
there, so I-I picked it up.

07:20.540 --> 07:23.065
And that's when
the front desk clerk saw you.

07:23.142 --> 07:24.507
Looks bad, doesn't it?

07:25.378 --> 07:27.710
- That all depends.
- On?

07:28.948 --> 07:31.280
Your dress. I'll...
I'll need you to remove it.

07:33.920 --> 07:35.615
Of course.

07:36.522 --> 07:37.853
Where do you want me?

07:40.526 --> 07:42.494
What are you doing?
Please! Put that back on.

07:44.263 --> 07:45.525
Mrs. Robinson, I-I simply meant

07:45.598 --> 07:47.657
that I need your dress
as evidence.

07:47.733 --> 07:48.665
Oh.

07:48.734 --> 07:51.259
One of the constables will
take you down to the station,

07:51.337 --> 07:54.238
and we'll get you another dress.

08:10.656 --> 08:12.021
George.

08:12.091 --> 08:13.991
I need you to run out
and purchase a dress.

08:14.060 --> 08:15.823
Oh, we've already got one
for Mrs. Robinson.

08:15.895 --> 08:16.884
No, it's... it's for me.

08:16.963 --> 08:18.760
Tired of the old
jacket and trousers, sir?

08:19.832 --> 08:22.392
I'll need it to be
a medium, white.

08:22.468 --> 08:24.197
And I'll need you
to phone this in

08:24.270 --> 08:26.534
to the slaughterhouse
on Tecumseh.

08:29.709 --> 08:31.370
Uh, sir?

08:38.083 --> 08:40.518
I've just spoken
to the Crown prosecutor.

08:40.586 --> 08:41.951
He thinks we've got
enough evidence

08:42.020 --> 08:43.488
that he can go to trial
next week.

08:43.556 --> 08:44.386
What?!

08:44.457 --> 08:47.620
Murdoch, I know that you take
great personal pride

08:47.693 --> 08:50.184
in having just two speeds...
slow and dead slow.

08:50.263 --> 08:51.252
No, it's not that, sir.

08:51.330 --> 08:52.797
I- I believe this woman
to be innocent.

08:52.865 --> 08:54.025
Innocent!
Bloody hell.

08:54.100 --> 08:56.625
She was found standing over the
body with a pistol in her hand.

08:56.736 --> 08:58.067
She fled the scene,
for God sakes.

08:58.104 --> 09:00.368
Yes, but there's
no blood spatter on her dress.

09:00.439 --> 09:01.633
She was covered in blood.

09:01.707 --> 09:03.504
Yes, a large blood stain

09:03.576 --> 09:06.067
from when she cradled
her dying husband.

09:06.145 --> 09:07.510
But he was shot at close range.

09:07.580 --> 09:08.979
If she had
indeed pulled the trigger,

09:09.048 --> 09:10.515
there would be
traces of blood spatter

09:10.583 --> 09:12.642
on her arm and her dress.

09:13.819 --> 09:14.945
You can prove this?

09:15.021 --> 09:16.750
- I believe I can.
- Then you'd better.

09:16.822 --> 09:19.120
They've not hung a woman
in this city for some time.

09:19.191 --> 09:22.649
Now, this woman, she's not got
a lot going for her.

09:22.728 --> 09:25.196
Higgins, get out of the way!

09:25.264 --> 09:27.596
Sir, there's a gentleman
to see you.

09:35.141 --> 09:37.439
Detective.
You've made a terrible mistake.

09:37.510 --> 09:39.034
You've arrested
the wrong person.

09:39.111 --> 09:40.703
Fannie wouldn't do this.

09:40.780 --> 09:42.407
And who might you be?

09:42.481 --> 09:46.247
I'm Ozzie Beers,
Amos Robinson's manager.

09:50.756 --> 09:53.919
Amos was like
the son I never had.

09:53.993 --> 09:56.223
I was running this gym
in Athens, Georgia,

09:56.295 --> 09:58.263
when I found him
living on the streets.

09:58.331 --> 10:01.391
14 years old.
Not a friend in the world.

10:01.467 --> 10:04.630
- When was this?
- That was 12 years ago.

10:04.704 --> 10:07.070
At first I had him cleaning up
around the place.

10:07.139 --> 10:09.300
Then I noticed that this boy
had some instincts.

10:09.375 --> 10:10.467
For the ring?

10:10.543 --> 10:12.534
Mmh.
Like I'd never seen before.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.375
So I brought him down
to Atlanta.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.381
Started him with the local kids.

10:16.449 --> 10:19.577
His first 40 fights...
40 knockouts.

10:19.652 --> 10:21.677
He could have been a champion.

10:21.754 --> 10:24.450
- What happened?
- It all got to his head.

10:24.523 --> 10:28.084
Women, drinking, gambling.
There was no end to it.

10:28.160 --> 10:30.754
Sounds like motive
for a long-suffering wife.

10:32.331 --> 10:33.423
Yeah.

10:33.499 --> 10:35.558
Fannie had been with him
since they were kids.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.865
Through the good times
and the bad times.

10:37.937 --> 10:40.428
- The bad times?
- Yeah.

10:40.506 --> 10:43.134
Amos became lazy,

10:43.209 --> 10:45.074
and it started to show
in the ring.

10:45.144 --> 10:47.009
He started losing
a lot more than he won.

10:47.079 --> 10:48.774
He gave Sullivan
quite a beating.

10:52.184 --> 10:54.448
There's a Bob Sullivan
in every town.

10:54.520 --> 10:57.421
Tough kid who thinks his hands
are faster than they really are

10:57.523 --> 10:59.013
and that he can take his punch.

10:59.058 --> 11:00.423
But let me tell you something...

11:00.493 --> 11:02.791
Amos might not have been
what he once was,

11:02.862 --> 11:05.695
but he sure could throw
a mean right cross.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.964
Did Amos have any enemies?

11:09.035 --> 11:11.936
Course he did.
That was his job.

11:12.004 --> 11:13.631
I don't understand.

11:13.706 --> 11:16.698
Everywhere he went...
different town, same fight.

11:16.776 --> 11:19.802
The local white champ
against the big black brute.

11:19.879 --> 11:22.347
The crowd was never too happy
when Amos won.

11:22.415 --> 11:25.646
Do you think one of Sullivan's
fans could have killed Amos?

11:25.718 --> 11:28.585
Well, we had bottles
thrown at us,

11:28.654 --> 11:30.554
knives pulled on us.

11:31.424 --> 11:33.221
Sometimes I think it's a wonder

11:33.292 --> 11:35.317
that he was never killed
before this.

11:37.897 --> 11:39.262
Detective.

11:52.044 --> 11:54.376
Sir, I've got your dress.

11:54.447 --> 11:56.813
Oh, good.
Hold it up.

12:01.587 --> 12:02.952
Perfect.

12:04.523 --> 12:08.653
Oh, and, sir...
Your pig has arrived.

12:11.964 --> 12:13.955
Newton's third law states
that for every action

12:14.033 --> 12:15.796
there is an equal
and opposite reaction.

12:15.868 --> 12:17.529
So fire a bullet into the body,

12:17.603 --> 12:19.594
and the body pushes back
with equal force.

12:19.672 --> 12:21.936
Hence blood spatter.

12:22.007 --> 12:23.998
That's a bit snug
in the bosom, sir.

12:24.076 --> 12:25.407
Right, then.

12:25.478 --> 12:28.413
Um, step forward six inches.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.516
18 inches.
We'll start there.

12:31.584 --> 12:34.018
Away you go.

12:34.086 --> 12:35.678
Will there be much spatter, sir?

12:35.755 --> 12:38.246
That's what we're here
to find out, George.

12:38.324 --> 12:39.382
Hurry up.
Shoot.

12:39.458 --> 12:42.359
The blood is draining
from the pig's flanks.

12:45.030 --> 12:47.396
It's staring at me, sir.

12:47.466 --> 12:48.797
George, the animal is dead.

12:48.868 --> 12:51.098
There's no spirit left
in the body.

12:52.705 --> 12:54.036
Do pigs have a soul, then, sir?

12:54.106 --> 12:55.733
Now, George!

13:08.287 --> 13:10.448
You shot a perfectly good pig
for this?

13:10.523 --> 13:12.150
Yes.
Look at the spray pattern.

13:12.224 --> 13:14.124
From a pig.
A dead one at that.

13:14.193 --> 13:15.217
The physics are the same.

13:15.294 --> 13:16.989
You've already explained it,
Murdoch.

13:17.062 --> 13:19.553
But it's not me
you need to convince.

13:19.632 --> 13:22.533
What are you gonna do?
Shoot a pig in court?

13:22.601 --> 13:24.660
Are you gonna parade
Sir Isaac Newton for some

13:24.737 --> 13:27.399
imbecile on a jury who shovels
up after horses for a living?

13:27.473 --> 13:30.067
- I hope it doesn't come to that.
- Yes, but it will come to that.

13:30.142 --> 13:32.406
Someone's been murdered.

13:32.478 --> 13:34.446
And I'm not gonna
release our only suspect

13:34.513 --> 13:36.276
based on blood spatter
from a dead pig.

13:36.348 --> 13:37.747
- But, sir...
- I understand, Murdoch.

13:37.817 --> 13:38.909
I really do.

13:38.984 --> 13:41.817
But this is not some
Presbyterian schoolgirl.

13:41.887 --> 13:44.287
This is the Hottentot wife
of a... of a flashy...

13:44.356 --> 13:45.721
Negress.

13:47.226 --> 13:48.921
I believe the proper term
is Negress.

13:52.431 --> 13:54.763
I don't care
what the proper term is.

13:54.834 --> 13:59.032
What I'm trying to tell you is
if this Negress goes to trial,

13:59.138 --> 14:01.072
she could hang.

14:11.317 --> 14:13.080
You wanted to see me, sir?

14:13.152 --> 14:14.380
Yes, George,
I need you to go

14:14.453 --> 14:15.750
on another shopping trip for me.

14:15.821 --> 14:17.982
I'm not gonna have to wear
another dress, am I, sir?

14:18.057 --> 14:18.648
No.

14:18.724 --> 14:20.817
Because the lads really gave me
a hard time when I...

14:20.893 --> 14:22.758
It's not a dress, George.

14:22.828 --> 14:24.796
I need you to get...

14:24.864 --> 14:25.796
Fireworks.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.093
Yes, I'm planning to use them

14:27.166 --> 14:29.191
to clarify some details
surrounding the shooting.

14:29.268 --> 14:30.929
Permission to
speak frankly, sir.

14:31.003 --> 14:32.265
Just say it, George.

14:32.338 --> 14:34.329
What if Fannie Robinson
is guilty?

14:34.406 --> 14:37.239
- She's not.
- Well, how can you be sure?

14:37.309 --> 14:39.368
Because of the absence
of blood spatter.

14:39.445 --> 14:41.072
I see.

14:41.146 --> 14:42.545
It seemed to me
that your decision

14:42.615 --> 14:45.743
had been based on something...
less concrete.

14:45.818 --> 14:48.844
Maybe something about her.
A gut feeling.

14:48.921 --> 14:50.445
Intuition.
Is that what you're suggesting?

14:50.522 --> 14:52.080
Well, I know
that's not scientific,

14:52.157 --> 14:56.787
but I've heard there are some
things that one can't fake...

14:56.896 --> 14:58.022
a genuine smile...

14:58.063 --> 15:00.395
Involuntary nerve control.
That's what you're speaking of.

15:00.466 --> 15:04.095
Perhaps you saw
some genuine goodness in her.

15:04.169 --> 15:07.400
What I saw was the absence
of blood spatter.

15:07.473 --> 15:10.101
However, that's not enough
to prove her innocence.

15:10.175 --> 15:13.702
So we shall have to prove it
by other means.

15:13.779 --> 15:15.007
Sir.

15:23.122 --> 15:24.612
Good God!

15:29.995 --> 15:32.054
Detective Murdoch!
What the devil?!

15:32.131 --> 15:33.120
No need to be alarmed.

15:33.198 --> 15:35.564
It's just Constable Crabtree
firing a gun.

15:35.634 --> 15:38.626
- In the hotel?
- Yes, we're conducting a test.

15:38.704 --> 15:40.899
Now, you say
you heard no gunshot,

15:40.973 --> 15:43.168
that it was probably masked
by the fireworks.

15:43.242 --> 15:44.709
That's correct.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.540
Ah, yes.
Please indulge me.

15:46.612 --> 15:49.410
- George, have Higgins proceed.
- Yes, sir.

15:49.481 --> 15:51.642
There's another constable
standing by outside,

15:51.717 --> 15:53.116
waiting to fire off.

15:55.087 --> 15:58.420
Mmh.
Some fireworks, eh?

15:58.524 --> 16:01.425
Now, to my ear, clearly not
as loud as a gunshot.

16:01.460 --> 16:04.623
So how is it possible you could
have confused the two?

16:04.697 --> 16:06.130
I- I don't know.

16:06.198 --> 16:07.358
Perhaps that's because

16:07.433 --> 16:10.368
you were not at your desk
the entire time.

16:11.837 --> 16:12.963
Come on, man.
Think!

16:13.038 --> 16:14.938
This is important.
A woman's life is at stake.

16:15.007 --> 16:18.306
Uh, I might have gone out
for a peek at the fireworks.

16:18.377 --> 16:21.642
- When?
- From 11:00 until quarter past.

16:21.714 --> 16:24.740
It... It must have
just slipped my mind.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.341
Ah.

16:26.418 --> 16:28.010
Well, should you recall
anything else

16:28.087 --> 16:29.520
that might have
slipped your mind...

16:29.588 --> 16:32.751
- I'll be sure to inform you.
- Thank you.

16:35.694 --> 16:37.457
So the gunshot
could have occurred

16:37.529 --> 16:39.156
half an hour earlier
than we'd thought.

16:39.231 --> 16:40.858
That would support
Mrs. Robinson's claim.

16:40.933 --> 16:43.424
- Precisely.
- If she didn't do it, who did?

16:43.502 --> 16:46.528
There was one very large loser
at the boxing match.

16:46.605 --> 16:48.596
Perhaps he didn't take it well.

16:52.578 --> 16:53.738
Bob Sullivan.

16:53.812 --> 16:55.439
What of it?

16:55.514 --> 16:56.776
I'm Detective William Murdoch.

16:56.882 --> 16:58.907
I'm investigating
the murder of Amos Robinson.

16:58.951 --> 17:02.443
- Yeah, too bad about that.
- You don't seem very sorry.

17:02.521 --> 17:06.890
Nobody's sorry.
Anyone says they are is a liar.

17:06.959 --> 17:09.450
Where were you last night
between 11:00 and midnight?

17:09.528 --> 17:12.156
Sitting in my chair
with my hands in the ice bucket.

17:12.231 --> 17:13.925
You have witnesses to this?

17:13.999 --> 17:16.160
I wasn't very good company
last night.

17:16.234 --> 17:17.223
Sore loser, were we?

17:17.301 --> 17:19.998
You can only lose
when it's a contest.

17:21.073 --> 17:22.199
The fight was a fix?

17:22.273 --> 17:25.367
Amos was supposed to go down
in the 31 st.

17:25.444 --> 17:27.002
Bastard blindsided me.

17:27.079 --> 17:29.274
Who set up the fix?

17:32.985 --> 17:34.577
- Oh!
- Ohh!

17:34.653 --> 17:35.745
Nicely done!

17:35.821 --> 17:37.721
Very good, very good.
Well done.

17:37.790 --> 17:39.348
Hello.

17:39.425 --> 17:40.915
Hello.

17:40.993 --> 17:43.894
I'm looking for Mr. Cutler.

17:43.962 --> 17:47.159
So why don't you ring the bell?

17:53.739 --> 17:55.570
You were at the fight
last night, weren't you?

17:55.641 --> 17:57.541
- Yes. Were you?
- No.

17:57.643 --> 18:00.441
Oh. Too bad.
It was spectacular.

18:00.479 --> 18:02.572
I'm glad the murder
of Mr. Robinson

18:02.648 --> 18:04.138
hasn't tainted your memory.

18:07.119 --> 18:08.245
Ma'am.

18:21.633 --> 18:24.727
I've been around the fight game
for a long time, Detective.

18:24.803 --> 18:28.705
The bad bets and the good bets
balance out over time.

18:28.774 --> 18:30.708
Even the ones
you're certain of winning?

18:34.680 --> 18:37.012
Yes. Even those.

18:38.150 --> 18:39.583
How much did you lose?

18:39.651 --> 18:41.778
$2,000, more or less.

18:41.854 --> 18:43.788
You must have been very upset.

18:47.292 --> 18:49.783
How much do you make
in a year, Detective?

18:49.862 --> 18:52.023
$400, give or take?

18:53.031 --> 18:55.727
I make 200 times that amount.

18:55.801 --> 18:59.202
Was I upset?
Of course.

18:59.304 --> 19:01.465
Enough to kill a man?

19:03.041 --> 19:06.636
Truth is I stood to gain
as much as I lost.

19:06.712 --> 19:08.771
Oh? How so?

19:08.847 --> 19:11.315
I'd just agreed to buy Robinson.

19:12.484 --> 19:13.917
I'm sorry... "buy" him?

19:13.986 --> 19:16.113
Ozzie Beers never saw
the big picture.

19:16.188 --> 19:18.486
It was all about the win
with him.

19:18.557 --> 19:23.221
He failed to realize that boxing
isn't sport, it's spectacle...

19:23.295 --> 19:27.629
the penultimate battle
between good and evil.

19:27.699 --> 19:29.633
With Robinson playing evil.

19:29.701 --> 19:33.228
Oh, he was perfect for the part.

19:33.305 --> 19:37.036
A hulking black Goliath.

19:37.109 --> 19:38.633
I even had a nickname.

19:40.312 --> 19:43.110
Amos the Animal!

19:44.149 --> 19:47.607
My wife thought Untamed Beast
was more provocative,

19:47.686 --> 19:51.281
but I confess a weakness
for alliteration.

19:51.356 --> 19:54.325
Yes. It's quite a feat
to reduce a man to a slogan.

19:54.393 --> 19:57.726
Mmh, it was
a business transaction.

19:57.796 --> 19:59.593
And how did Mr. Beers respond

19:59.665 --> 20:02.600
when you approached him
with this business transaction?

20:03.602 --> 20:05.797
I didn't go to Ozzie Beers,
Detective.

20:05.871 --> 20:08.465
Ozzie Beers came to me.

20:10.042 --> 20:12.476
Keep jabbing.
Keep those hands up.

20:12.544 --> 20:14.569
That's it.

20:14.646 --> 20:16.307
That's it.

20:16.381 --> 20:17.939
Eyeing the new talent?

20:19.851 --> 20:21.284
Well, what else am I to do?

20:21.353 --> 20:23.719
Yes, I suppose mourning
would be out of the question.

20:23.789 --> 20:25.757
Amos was, after all,
just a commodity.

20:26.658 --> 20:28.285
You've been speaking
to Jeb Cutler, huh?

20:28.360 --> 20:30.624
You told me Amos Robinson
was like a son to you.

20:30.696 --> 20:32.596
He was.
Not a word of a lie in that.

20:32.664 --> 20:35.462
But sometimes things change
between fathers and sons.

20:35.534 --> 20:37.434
So you sold him
like an old racehorse.

20:37.502 --> 20:38.764
I did it for his own good.

20:38.837 --> 20:41.169
- The circuit was killing him.
- So better a circus.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.264
The way things were going,

20:42.341 --> 20:44.002
who'd have known
what would happen to Amos.

20:44.076 --> 20:45.907
Maybe a man like
Jeb Cutler could manage him,

20:45.978 --> 20:48.208
but all I know is
I couldn't control him anymore.

20:48.280 --> 20:50.748
You mean you couldn't get him
to throw fights for you anymore.

20:50.816 --> 20:53.478
I have never asked a boxer to
throw a fight before this one.

20:53.552 --> 20:55.986
And that was only because Cutler
wanted to build a rivalry

20:56.054 --> 20:57.385
between his man and Amos.

20:57.489 --> 21:00.424
- And Amos agreed to throw it.
- So why did he change his mind?

21:01.293 --> 21:02.385
I don't know.

21:02.461 --> 21:03.985
Did he know
you were going to sell him?

21:04.062 --> 21:06.121
I sure as hell
didn't tell him that.

21:12.070 --> 21:13.435
He sold Amos?

21:14.906 --> 21:17.101
How could Ozzie do that to him?

21:17.175 --> 21:19.200
Do you think Amos knew?

21:20.045 --> 21:22.138
If he did, he never told me.

21:23.582 --> 21:26.210
But had he known, do you think
he would have changed his mind

21:26.285 --> 21:27.411
about throwing the fight?

21:27.486 --> 21:28.919
If he felt wronged.

21:29.755 --> 21:33.247
Amos was his own man,
capable of anything.

21:34.493 --> 21:36.723
He must have known.

21:36.795 --> 21:38.524
But why didn't he tell me?

21:38.597 --> 21:41.157
Maybe he just never found
the right time.

21:43.669 --> 21:45.830
It wasn't always like this.

21:45.904 --> 21:48.771
We had planned to go
to California,

21:48.840 --> 21:52.173
settle down,
once Amos finished fighting.

21:53.111 --> 21:55.875
Can I ask you
a personal question?

21:57.616 --> 21:58.947
Why not?

22:01.086 --> 22:03.520
You could have left Amos.

22:03.588 --> 22:05.317
Why didn't you?

22:06.525 --> 22:08.516
I don't know.

22:08.593 --> 22:10.356
Guess I should have.

22:12.164 --> 22:14.758
Something just kept me
holding on.

22:21.306 --> 22:22.898
He was shot in the heart.

22:22.974 --> 22:24.999
The bullet entered
the right ventricle

22:25.077 --> 22:26.669
and lodged in the left atrium.

22:26.745 --> 22:27.803
He died quickly.

22:27.879 --> 22:29.676
Before he hit the ground,
I would imagine.

22:29.748 --> 22:32.273
It amazes me how something
so large and vigorous

22:32.351 --> 22:34.148
can be brought down
by something so small.

22:34.219 --> 22:36.084
I've recovered the bullet,
if you'd like to see it.

22:36.154 --> 22:37.917
Yes, I would.
Thank you.

22:39.024 --> 22:41.959
Is that why women
were so attracted to him?

22:43.862 --> 22:45.386
How do you mean?

22:46.398 --> 22:48.389
Is brute strength so compelling?

22:48.467 --> 22:51.027
To some women.

22:51.103 --> 22:53.799
Mr. Darwin calls it
sexual selection.

22:53.872 --> 22:56.363
Large males
able to defeat other males

22:56.441 --> 22:58.500
have more reproductive success.

22:58.610 --> 23:02.137
Therefore women
find them appealing.

23:02.180 --> 23:05.616
And what of peaceable types
who live in their mind?

23:05.684 --> 23:08.915
How do they fare in this
great Darwinian struggle?

23:10.956 --> 23:14.653
Some women are attracted
to intelligence.

23:14.726 --> 23:17.854
Others prefer a combination.

23:18.797 --> 23:20.162
An intelligent thug.

23:21.099 --> 23:23.624
A somewhat intriguing concept,
don't you think?

23:24.803 --> 23:26.600
We have a problem.

23:26.671 --> 23:28.036
It's called a light load.

23:28.106 --> 23:29.539
- A light load?
- Yes.

23:29.608 --> 23:32.702
See the plier marks
here on the lead?

23:32.778 --> 23:33.972
Next slide.

23:38.483 --> 23:39.507
Thank you.

23:39.584 --> 23:41.745
Now, you can make out
the vise marks here

23:41.820 --> 23:43.720
on the spent cartridge.

23:44.556 --> 23:45.784
It's an old trick.

23:47.159 --> 23:49.650
Remove the slug
from the cartridge.

23:52.063 --> 23:54.156
Empty out most of the powder.

23:55.901 --> 23:58.495
And replace the slug.

24:01.006 --> 24:02.303
The load has been lightened.

24:02.374 --> 24:05.537
Now, at close range,
the bullet is still deadly.

24:05.610 --> 24:10.274
But the sound of the discharge
is significantly dampened.

24:10.348 --> 24:12.612
Uh, close the door, George.

24:15.821 --> 24:17.789
And turn off the lamp.

24:21.893 --> 24:23.190
Right, then.

24:28.834 --> 24:31.098
That's remarkable.

24:31.169 --> 24:33.364
If the door of the hotel room
was closed,

24:33.438 --> 24:35.372
the front desk clerk
may not have heard that.

24:35.440 --> 24:38.136
If we can't prove
what time the gunshot happened,

24:38.210 --> 24:40.269
then we can't separate
the time of the shooting

24:40.345 --> 24:43.781
from the discovery of Fannie
standing over the body.

24:43.849 --> 24:46.841
I guess it's not looking so good
for Fannie after all.

24:46.918 --> 24:48.317
No, it's not.

25:00.899 --> 25:02.560
I'll agree it's a setback, sir.

25:02.634 --> 25:05.865
But you still have
the blood-splatter evidence.

25:05.937 --> 25:06.961
With the lighter load,

25:07.038 --> 25:08.733
the muzzle velocity
would be reduced

25:08.807 --> 25:11.071
and the spatter dynamics
different.

25:11.142 --> 25:13.940
I suppose we could always
shoot another pig.

25:14.012 --> 25:16.810
No, I'm done shooting pigs,
George.

25:18.650 --> 25:22.313
Problem is there really is
only one viable suspect.

25:23.522 --> 25:24.682
Mrs. Robinson.

25:27.626 --> 25:30.026
Maybe we just haven't
dug deeply enough.

25:31.696 --> 25:34.631
No.
No, we haven't.

25:34.699 --> 25:37.532
Go back to the hotel.
Turn the place upside down.

25:37.602 --> 25:39.763
If there's something
we've missed, I want it found.

25:39.838 --> 25:40.827
Yes, sir.

25:43.408 --> 25:46.434
How would Fannie Robinson know
how to light-load a bullet?

25:46.511 --> 25:48.502
She could have bought the bullet
from someone who did.

25:48.580 --> 25:49.842
That would suggest
premeditation.

25:49.915 --> 25:51.405
I don't believe
she's capable of that.

25:51.483 --> 25:52.643
Really?
Based on what?

25:52.717 --> 25:56.278
I don't know.
Something in her face.

25:56.354 --> 25:58.515
She's a very attractive woman.

26:00.692 --> 26:02.489
You think
I want to prove her innocent

26:02.561 --> 26:03.721
because I'm attracted to her?

26:03.795 --> 26:06.093
Any man could be swayed,
Murdoch.

26:06.164 --> 26:08.428
If I'm swayed by anything,
it's the truth.

26:08.500 --> 26:10.593
- Better a guilty man go free.
- Exactly.

26:10.669 --> 26:12.193
You have any other suspects?

26:12.270 --> 26:13.669
Several.

26:13.738 --> 26:16.172
Then find out if one of them
was at the hotel.

26:16.241 --> 26:18.106
The killer's not invisible,
Murdoch.

26:18.176 --> 26:19.700
Somebody must have seen him.

26:37.862 --> 26:39.124
These are all the photos

26:39.197 --> 26:40.323
from the night of the fight?

26:40.398 --> 26:41.729
Would I keep anything from you?

26:41.800 --> 26:44.166
If you thought it might sell
a paper, yes.

26:44.235 --> 26:45.634
You know, Detective,

26:45.704 --> 26:48.901
your problem is that you haven't
quite grasped the system.

26:48.974 --> 26:50.236
What system might that be?

26:50.308 --> 26:52.003
Oh, come on.
You know how things work.

26:52.077 --> 26:53.840
You and me...
We need each other.

26:53.912 --> 26:55.072
I find that hard to believe.

26:55.146 --> 26:59.139
Look, we need stories, and you
coppers need to look good.

26:59.250 --> 27:01.343
And on occasion
you need information.

27:01.386 --> 27:03.479
This arrangement
sounds less than scrupulous.

27:03.555 --> 27:05.420
Scruples.

27:05.490 --> 27:06.787
Scruples have nothing
to do with it.

27:06.858 --> 27:09.122
Acumen.
That's what I'd call it.

27:09.194 --> 27:10.126
Right.

27:10.195 --> 27:11.685
I'll take this one,

27:11.763 --> 27:14.197
this one...
no, this one's better...

27:14.265 --> 27:16.028
and this one.

27:17.569 --> 27:19.901
No need to thank me.

27:19.971 --> 27:22.633
Your natural charm compels me.

27:39.457 --> 27:40.822
Come in.

27:41.826 --> 27:44.727
Sir, we found something.

27:49.701 --> 27:50.895
It's only a partial print,

27:50.969 --> 27:53.460
but it should be enough to make
a match if we find the killer.

27:53.538 --> 27:55.438
Show me your boot tread, George.

27:59.544 --> 28:01.910
- As I suspected.
- Sir, I swear it wasn't me.

28:01.980 --> 28:04.744
No, no, no. It means the boot
is standard police issue.

28:04.816 --> 28:06.078
Could have been any one of us.

28:06.151 --> 28:08.244
No one stepped in the blood
in Amos Robinson's room.

28:08.319 --> 28:10.617
I saw to it personally.

28:10.689 --> 28:13.385
Then where did the blood
come from?

28:14.426 --> 28:17.293
He was shot here
and stumbled back to his room.

28:17.362 --> 28:20.126
No. It can't be.
He died instantly.

28:22.834 --> 28:25.769
He was shot somewhere else
and dragged back to his room.

28:27.505 --> 28:30.474
We just have to follow
the trail of blood.

28:30.542 --> 28:32.476
We've been over every inch
of this hotel, sir.

28:32.544 --> 28:34.478
This is the only spot of blood
we've found.

28:34.546 --> 28:35.774
No, there's a blood trail here.

28:35.847 --> 28:37.974
We just need something sensitive
enough to follow it.

28:38.049 --> 28:39.346
A bloodhound or something.

28:39.417 --> 28:41.146
Ted Manson
keeps a bitch on Mercer.

28:41.219 --> 28:43.312
Get it. You know what
this means, don't you?

28:43.388 --> 28:45.049
It means a 120-pound woman

28:45.123 --> 28:47.182
couldn't drag a body
twice that weight.

28:47.258 --> 28:49.021
Across carpet, no less.

28:49.094 --> 28:50.721
Means she's innocent.

28:53.031 --> 28:55.499
Ozzie, I'm scared.

28:55.567 --> 28:58.832
I know. I know.
But it's gonna be all right.

28:58.937 --> 29:00.962
I'm sure of it.

29:01.005 --> 29:02.996
Mrs. Robinson.

29:03.074 --> 29:05.304
Hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

29:05.376 --> 29:07.276
But I believe I have
some good news.

29:07.345 --> 29:09.176
- Good news?
- Yes.

29:09.247 --> 29:11.272
Based on blood
that I found in the hall,

29:11.349 --> 29:12.714
I think I can prove
that your husband

29:12.784 --> 29:15.753
was killed in one location
and then moved to your room.

29:15.820 --> 29:17.947
But this proves it's not me.

29:18.022 --> 29:19.580
It strongly suggests
your innocence.

29:19.657 --> 29:21.147
We still have to determine that

29:21.226 --> 29:23.592
and, of course,
find out who the killer is.

29:23.661 --> 29:25.595
You said killed elsewhere.

29:25.663 --> 29:27.221
- Yes.
- Where?

29:27.298 --> 29:29.232
I was hoping you might be able
to help me with that.

29:29.300 --> 29:31.427
Do you know of anywhere else
he might have been that night?

29:31.503 --> 29:32.629
Maybe he went for a drink.

29:32.704 --> 29:34.865
Were you having any trouble
with anyone else

29:34.939 --> 29:36.270
staying in the hotel that night?

29:36.341 --> 29:37.831
Perhaps one of
Sullivan's supporters?

29:37.909 --> 29:39.900
No.
Not that I can think of.

29:39.978 --> 29:41.002
Me neither.

29:41.079 --> 29:43.070
But there were lots of people
coming and going.

29:44.215 --> 29:46.683
Well, if you think of anything.

29:46.751 --> 29:48.184
Of course.

29:49.687 --> 29:52.850
Ozzie, this means
I'm not gonna hang!

29:52.924 --> 29:54.755
See?
I knew something would happen.

29:54.826 --> 29:56.521
I knew it.

29:56.594 --> 29:58.585
A ferret?

29:58.663 --> 30:00.153
Ted Manson took his dog hunting.

30:00.231 --> 30:02.631
But his son swears this ferret
will follow a trail of blood

30:02.700 --> 30:04.600
like no hound he's ever seen.

30:05.904 --> 30:08.065
Let's see what it can do.

30:08.139 --> 30:09.299
Okay, boy.

30:09.374 --> 30:11.069
Take a good whiff.
Take a good whiff.

30:11.142 --> 30:12.370
Here you go.

30:12.443 --> 30:13.967
Come on, sweetheart.
There you go.

30:31.229 --> 30:33.459
Hey! Careful, sir, they're...
they're known to bite!

30:33.531 --> 30:34.463
What?!

30:34.532 --> 30:36.500
Cut off access to your...
to your sensitive bits!

30:36.568 --> 30:37.500
I am!
I am!

30:37.569 --> 30:38.558
Ah! Ow!

30:40.839 --> 30:42.602
He's going up the stairs.

30:47.378 --> 30:49.676
Is it following the blood
at all?

30:49.747 --> 30:52.272
I'm sorry, sir.
I- I thought it was worth a shot.

30:53.618 --> 30:55.313
There he goes.

30:59.424 --> 31:00.550
I don't see him.

31:00.625 --> 31:02.115
Do you think he's hiding?

31:02.193 --> 31:03.217
I don't care.

31:03.294 --> 31:05.660
Get Ted Junior up here
to ferret him out.

31:05.730 --> 31:09.291
"Ferret. "
That's very good, sir.

31:09.367 --> 31:10.994
Humor in the face of adversity.

31:11.069 --> 31:12.229
I see him!

31:13.504 --> 31:16.632
Careful, George.
They're known to bite.

31:19.410 --> 31:20.707
Well, you have him?

31:21.746 --> 31:23.236
I have this.

31:26.184 --> 31:27.811
Who rented that room?

31:29.020 --> 31:31.045
The room was rented
by a Mrs. Smith.

31:31.122 --> 31:32.453
Mrs. Smith?

31:32.523 --> 31:34.354
We get a lot
of Smiths and Jones.

31:34.425 --> 31:36.188
This isn't exactly
the Queen's Hotel.

31:36.261 --> 31:37.285
Now, see here...

31:37.362 --> 31:39.262
You have
a statutory responsibility

31:39.330 --> 31:40.388
to accurately record all...

31:40.465 --> 31:43.457
I get paid 18 cents an hour,
all right?

31:43.534 --> 31:45.866
If you have a problem
with how I do my job,

31:45.937 --> 31:47.404
take it up with the boss.

31:47.472 --> 31:48.234
Fine.

31:48.306 --> 31:49.830
I'll need you
to look at these photos

31:49.908 --> 31:51.500
and tell me
if any one of these people

31:51.576 --> 31:53.635
were here at the hotel
last night.

31:53.711 --> 31:55.576
Use this if it helps.

31:58.216 --> 31:59.148
No.

32:04.088 --> 32:05.521
- No.
- None of them?

32:05.590 --> 32:07.319
If I'd known there was
gonna be a murder,

32:07.392 --> 32:09.292
I would have
paid more attention.

32:12.897 --> 32:15.092
Now, him I recognize.

32:15.166 --> 32:16.224
- This man?
- No.

32:16.301 --> 32:17.859
- Him?
- No. No, no.

32:17.936 --> 32:20.871
Him.
He was here last night.

32:29.047 --> 32:31.607
We caught him boarding
the 716 to Kingston.

32:33.384 --> 32:35.682
Where were you heading
in such a hurry, Mr. Sullivan?

32:35.753 --> 32:37.243
- New Brunswick.
- Why?

32:37.322 --> 32:39.586
Why not? I'll never fight
in this town again.

32:39.657 --> 32:42.956
- I think you were running.
- From what?

32:43.027 --> 32:44.517
You were
at the Prince Albert Hotel

32:44.595 --> 32:46.290
the night of the murder,
weren't you?

32:48.366 --> 32:50.926
Yeah. I had a score to settle
with Amos.

32:51.002 --> 32:53.402
- So you killed him?
- I never killed Amos Robinson.

32:53.471 --> 32:55.200
I just gave him
a taste of his own medicine.

32:55.273 --> 32:56.797
You hit him?

32:56.908 --> 33:01.743
The last time I saw Amos, he was
on his knees in the hallway,

33:01.779 --> 33:04.111
holding his nose
like a little boy.

33:04.182 --> 33:06.946
I don't believe you.
I think you're lying.

33:07.018 --> 33:09.350
Well, then, lucky for me
I've got a witness.

33:10.722 --> 33:12.053
Who?

33:16.928 --> 33:19.590
Hello, Detective.

33:20.832 --> 33:22.925
Care for a swing?

33:24.535 --> 33:27.333
Were you at the Prince Albert
Hotel the night of the murder?

33:29.073 --> 33:32.236
- Who told you that?
- Bob Sullivan.

33:32.310 --> 33:34.335
Oh, yes.
Of course.

33:34.412 --> 33:35.504
More to the point...

33:35.580 --> 33:38.481
What were you doing in a room
with Amos Robinson?

33:39.484 --> 33:40.678
Why...

33:41.686 --> 33:43.881
I was seducing him.

33:45.023 --> 33:47.184
Does that shock you?

33:48.526 --> 33:51.825
Did your husband know
of this encounter?

33:52.997 --> 33:55.158
Of course he knew.

33:55.233 --> 33:57.428
He was in the room with us.

34:01.572 --> 34:06.600
My wife and I
have an unusual marriage.

34:08.478 --> 34:10.538
If we weren't
forthcoming earlier,

34:10.614 --> 34:15.382
it's because we like to keep
these things to ourselves.

34:15.453 --> 34:18.114
Surely you can see that.

34:19.257 --> 34:21.690
I think you're both lying to me.

34:21.759 --> 34:25.058
I think you arranged
a rendezvous with Mr. Robinson.

34:25.129 --> 34:28.326
You found out about it, and in
a jealous rage, you shot him.

34:28.399 --> 34:31.697
Now you've both cooked up
this ridiculous story.

34:34.237 --> 34:36.797
Is it so ridiculous
for a man to take pleasure

34:36.873 --> 34:38.864
in his partner's pleasure?

34:38.943 --> 34:41.672
In this manner, yes.

34:41.746 --> 34:44.772
So judgmental.

34:44.849 --> 34:49.309
It was clear Mr. Robinson wasn't
interested in fighting for me.

34:49.387 --> 34:53.346
I'd hoped to change his mind.

34:55.226 --> 34:56.955
What Jeb means is he hoped

34:57.061 --> 34:59.586
I would change
Mr. Robinson's mind.

34:59.630 --> 35:02.895
And were you successful
in either seduction?

35:04.302 --> 35:07.032
No, I'm sad to say.

35:07.105 --> 35:11.542
Seems he'd decided to embark
on his new life.

35:11.609 --> 35:13.167
He was going to give it all up.

35:13.244 --> 35:15.405
He'd made some money
betting on himself.

35:15.480 --> 35:18.074
My money, as it turns out.

35:19.083 --> 35:20.482
And he was going to
give his wife

35:20.551 --> 35:22.314
the life she'd always wanted.

35:23.588 --> 35:25.954
How dreadfully domestic.

35:28.693 --> 35:30.718
What did Mr. Robinson do next?

35:30.795 --> 35:34.754
The last we saw of him,
he walked back to his room.

36:00.191 --> 36:03.058
So his body wasn't moved.

36:04.095 --> 36:08.327
The trail of blood was from Amos
when he walked back to his room.

36:08.399 --> 36:10.026
But that means...

36:10.101 --> 36:12.365
I've built your hopes up.

36:12.436 --> 36:13.960
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have done that.

36:14.038 --> 36:15.164
No.

36:15.239 --> 36:17.104
You tried.

36:17.175 --> 36:18.836
You really tried.

36:19.710 --> 36:21.735
I appreciate that.

36:29.520 --> 36:32.512
You know,
Amos wasn't always bad.

36:33.491 --> 36:37.052
But all those years of people
expecting something from him...

36:37.128 --> 36:39.028
me included...

36:40.164 --> 36:41.631
...all those punches,

36:41.699 --> 36:44.964
night after night,

36:45.036 --> 36:47.869
just wears a man down.

36:47.939 --> 36:53.172
Sometimes I wonder if he had
any love left in him at all.

36:53.244 --> 36:56.975
If it helps, he did.

36:57.081 --> 36:59.140
He was going to keep his promise

36:59.183 --> 37:02.084
and give you the life
you'd always dreamed of.

37:05.256 --> 37:06.951
It does help.

37:07.858 --> 37:09.257
Thank you.

37:18.936 --> 37:20.927
I hear you're back
where you started.

37:21.005 --> 37:22.666
So it would appear.

37:22.740 --> 37:25.766
You understand that
she has to go to trial now?

37:26.711 --> 37:29.578
My commiserations, Murdoch.
I know how you feel.

37:29.647 --> 37:32.616
- Sir?
- I've seen innocent men hang.

37:32.683 --> 37:34.708
It's the toughest pill
I've ever had to swallow.

37:35.987 --> 37:37.113
You think she's innocent?

37:37.188 --> 37:39.816
I must admit
I was skeptical at first.

37:39.890 --> 37:43.519
Maybe even influenced
by the color of her skin.

37:43.594 --> 37:46.154
But you've since
convinced me otherwise.

37:46.230 --> 37:48.289
At least one of us is convinced.

37:48.366 --> 37:50.425
Don't tell me
you're having doubts now.

37:50.501 --> 37:52.469
There is nothing
that exonerates her.

37:52.536 --> 37:53.628
Based on what?

37:53.704 --> 37:55.695
Logic?
The compendium of evidence?

37:55.773 --> 37:57.138
Well, bugger that, Murdoch.

37:57.241 --> 37:58.265
You think she's innocent

37:58.309 --> 38:00.140
based on nothing
but your own intuition.

38:00.211 --> 38:01.439
But of what use is that?

38:01.512 --> 38:04.709
Intuition isn't a reliable basis
upon which to form an opinion.

38:04.782 --> 38:07.342
What kind of socks am I wearing?

38:07.418 --> 38:08.715
Pardon?

38:08.786 --> 38:11.448
Brown, black, or argyle?

38:11.522 --> 38:14.514
- I-I don't know.
- Well, guess.

38:15.493 --> 38:16.653
Argyle.

38:19.330 --> 38:22.697
Well, sir, what kind of socks
are you wearing?

38:24.568 --> 38:27.366
You should learn to trust
your intuition, me old mucker.

39:06.711 --> 39:09.179
I need the key
to Ozzie Beers' room.

39:56.827 --> 39:58.886
Where were you
between 10:30 and midnight

39:58.963 --> 40:00.055
the night of the murder?

40:00.131 --> 40:02.099
- I was in my room.
- The whole night?

40:02.166 --> 40:04.964
I went down to the docks for
a bit and watched the fireworks.

40:05.035 --> 40:08.061
- So you have no alibi?
- Didn't know I needed one.

40:09.106 --> 40:11.870
Did you happen to change
your shirt that night?

40:11.942 --> 40:13.967
Yes, I did.

40:14.044 --> 40:17.013
Before or after you went
to watch the fireworks?

40:17.081 --> 40:18.241
Before.

40:18.315 --> 40:20.283
- Why?
- Because I felt like it.

40:20.351 --> 40:23.115
There's no law against changing
into a fresh shirt, is there?

40:23.187 --> 40:24.779
No.

40:24.855 --> 40:28.723
But it does raise questions when
you decide to burn the old one.

40:28.793 --> 40:30.590
Found these buttons
in your stove.

40:31.796 --> 40:33.889
I also found
these train tickets.

40:33.964 --> 40:35.625
San Francisco?

40:35.699 --> 40:37.792
I've never been there.
I hear it's quite nice.

40:37.868 --> 40:39.802
Good boxing town too.

40:41.939 --> 40:43.804
Who was the other ticket for?

40:46.977 --> 40:48.842
Fannie Robinson, maybe?

40:50.448 --> 40:53.076
You were hoping she would
leave Amos, weren't you?

40:55.152 --> 40:57.086
He didn't deserve her.

40:58.389 --> 41:00.289
But you did.

41:01.826 --> 41:05.193
Is that why you sold him
to Jeb Cutler?

41:05.262 --> 41:07.696
So you could finally get him
out of the picture?

41:07.765 --> 41:09.027
Maybe I did.

41:09.099 --> 41:11.863
But coveting another man's wife
may be a sin,

41:11.936 --> 41:13.028
but it's not a crime.

41:13.103 --> 41:15.401
- But murder is.
- Prove it.

41:15.473 --> 41:17.338
I went down
to the train station.

41:17.408 --> 41:19.968
These tickets were Amos's.

41:20.911 --> 41:21.843
He had had enough.

41:21.912 --> 41:23.004
He was going to quit

41:23.080 --> 41:24.911
and give Fannie the life
she had always dreamed of.

41:24.982 --> 41:26.142
And he told you.

41:26.217 --> 41:29.050
So you shot him
point-blank in the heart.

41:30.988 --> 41:33.388
You burned your shirt because
it had blood spatter on it.

41:33.457 --> 41:35.550
I burned my shirt
because it stank!

41:35.626 --> 41:37.321
Are you willing to let her hang?

41:37.394 --> 41:40.557
- She won't hang.
- How can you be sure?

41:47.505 --> 41:50.235
Neither one of us
wants to see Fannie hang.

41:50.307 --> 41:53.208
But only you
can do something about it.

41:55.312 --> 41:57.075
You see, Mr. Beers...

41:59.383 --> 42:01.908
...I don't know what happened
in that room.

42:03.354 --> 42:05.652
Perhaps there was
a confrontation.

42:05.723 --> 42:07.122
Maybe it got violent.

42:08.792 --> 42:13.923
And maybe you had no choice
but to act in self-defense.

42:17.334 --> 42:20.428
Do you understand
what I'm saying, Mr. Beers?

42:24.842 --> 42:27.538
It was violent.

42:27.611 --> 42:32.412
And he got very, very angry.

42:32.483 --> 42:34.781
I feared for my life.

42:55.739 --> 42:57.001
"But he kept coming on.

42:57.107 --> 42:59.234
I then fired one shot
to save my own life.

42:59.276 --> 43:00.868
Sincerely, Ozzie Beers. "

43:00.945 --> 43:03.413
Self-defense.
A likely story, eh?

43:03.480 --> 43:05.209
It's a defense
he's entitled to raise.

43:05.282 --> 43:07.079
It's our obligation
to prove otherwise.

43:07.151 --> 43:08.812
Better a guilty man go free,
eh, Murdoch?

43:08.886 --> 43:10.251
There is one thing, however.

43:11.255 --> 43:12.654
Well?
Out with it.

43:12.723 --> 43:15.487
The gun did belong to Mr. Beers.
He admits that.

43:15.559 --> 43:17.550
However, the bullets
were tampered with.

43:17.628 --> 43:19.562
- The light loads.
- Exactly.

43:19.630 --> 43:21.154
Now I would ask myself,

43:21.231 --> 43:25.031
why would someone carry a gun
loaded with customized bullets?

43:25.102 --> 43:27.434
Unless he planned
to kill in advance.

43:28.505 --> 43:30.837
I should think the Crown would
have a very strong argument

43:30.908 --> 43:33.035
that this is indeed
a case of cold-blooded murder.

43:33.978 --> 43:37.505
I believe Mr. Beers is in
for a very nasty surprise.

43:38.415 --> 43:39.905
Precisely.

43:45.556 --> 43:48.855
I thought Ozzie
might have feelings for me.

43:48.926 --> 43:51.292
But he sure had
a funny way of showing it.

43:53.130 --> 43:55.121
- Where will you go?
- I don't know.

43:55.199 --> 43:57.064
I don't have anything now.

43:57.167 --> 43:59.931
Except for my life,
thanks to you.

43:59.970 --> 44:03.269
It seems Amos had bought
these tickets.

44:06.043 --> 44:08.603
San Francisco.
But how?

44:11.882 --> 44:14.407
He bet on himself in the fight.

44:14.485 --> 44:16.009
His gift to you.

44:16.086 --> 44:18.213
That should be enough
to start a new life.

44:18.288 --> 44:19.812
But how could I?

44:19.890 --> 44:22.051
It just won't seem the same
without him.

44:22.126 --> 44:23.593
I think he would want you to.

44:24.762 --> 44:27.526
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

44:31.335 --> 44:32.563
How did you know?

44:33.404 --> 44:35.736
You knew right from the start
I didn't do it.

44:35.806 --> 44:39.799
When I saw the dress,
I calculated the angle of...

44:43.380 --> 44:44.847
It was intuition.

44:48.285 --> 44:49.809
Thank you.
