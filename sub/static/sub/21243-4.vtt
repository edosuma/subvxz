to be safe.

10:50.692 --> 10:51.818
Why would they do that?

10:51.901 --> 10:54.654
It says they have a credible threat.

10:54.737 --> 10:57.824
It seems a little much.
It happened all the way across the ocean.

I got someone pregnant.

13:20.507 --> 13:22.509
And I don't want to blame the drugs...

to see the kid.

-Her.

13:34.897 --> 13:36.315
No, and I can't.

13:38.359 --> 13:40.611
But it did make me get myself clean.

13:43.155 --> 13:46.325

22:23.174 --> 22:25.343
I should have fought those guys for you.

22:25.427 --> 22:27.638
No, you shouldn't have.
That would have been foolish.

22:29.264 --> 22:30.807
But so is us hanging out.

22:30.891 --> 22:32.601
I think we should stop.

22:32.684 --> 22:35.979
But we're still going to plan
prom together, right?

22:36.062 --> 22:38.064
No, I'm resigning.

22:38.148 --> 22:41.151
I'm going to spend my time
creating a Muslim students' association.

22:41.234 --> 22:43.529
You can't do both?

22:44.405 --> 22:46.281
You're sweet, Winston.

22:46.364 --> 22:47.658
But, right now,

22:47.741 --> 22:51.036
I need to make sure that none of our
Muslim students feel alone.

22:59.878 --> 23:01.922
