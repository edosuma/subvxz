WEBVTT

00:02.803 --> 00:03.804
I'll come after you.

00:03.871 --> 00:06.147
It's my problem, Hawke.
Just stay away from this one.

00:06.206 --> 00:07.514
Next on Airwolf.

00:11.478 --> 00:13.082
We can't just go in there shoot’n,

00:13.146 --> 00:15.183
there's no telling what might happen to Doc.

00:16.950 --> 00:17.951
Hold it right there!

00:18.051 --> 00:19.086
We'll never make it.

00:19.152 --> 00:21.098
Yeah, we will. I've got the lady.

00:25.926 --> 00:28.372
Local F-4's, a pair of them, closing fast.

02:32.653 --> 02:34.690
Papa.

02:42.763 --> 02:44.674
Teresa…

02:44.731 --> 02:46.768
We're gonna get you out of here, Papa.

03:49.696 --> 03:51.175
How is he?

03:51.331 --> 03:52.708
He's worse than before.

03:53.567 --> 03:56.013
Those animals, they did nothing for him.

03:56.436 --> 03:59.383
He needs rest, warmth, time to recover.

04:00.807 --> 04:02.844
Where is he?

04:05.645 --> 04:07.522
Rest, Papa.

04:07.581 --> 04:09.083
Where is he?

04:09.182 --> 04:10.752
The President returns today

04:10.817 --> 04:12.922
from his historic Middle East visit,

04:12.986 --> 04:17.128
promising to have the new trade bill
outlined before the end of this month.

04:17.190 --> 04:20.329
The US Attorney General has given
the go-ahead to new funding to be…

04:20.392 --> 04:23.465
Well, look at this. Got yourself
some beauties there, Hawke.

04:23.530 --> 04:25.032
Where'd you catch ‘em?

04:25.098 --> 04:26.475
Other side of the lake, over there.

04:28.034 --> 04:31.607
There's plenty more where these
came from. You oughta try your hand.

04:31.671 --> 04:33.878
Yeah sure, this afternoon.

04:35.909 --> 04:38.355
There some reason why you're always
glued to the news like that?

04:38.545 --> 04:40.081
There are some friends of mine,

04:40.147 --> 04:44.061
I think there might be someth’n on the
news about ‘em. I wanna catch it.

04:46.486 --> 04:48.124
Anybody I might know?

04:48.188 --> 04:49.428
I don't think so.

04:50.490 --> 04:52.128
It's another place, another time, you know.

04:53.960 --> 04:57.430
Well, I caught ‘em,

04:58.265 --> 04:59.835
you clean ‘em.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.937
…cockles of any heart.

05:02.002 --> 05:03.675
Little Tommy Rombeo and his…

05:39.539 --> 05:40.779
Hello.

05:41.007 --> 05:42.077
Hello to you, too.

05:43.944 --> 05:47.221
Sorry to tell you, but this little
piece of paradise is already taken.

05:48.248 --> 05:50.751
We will not stay. Mr. Jason Gifford?

05:51.418 --> 05:52.419
That's me.

05:53.286 --> 05:56.267
The people at the lodge said
that we might find you here.

05:56.323 --> 05:58.894
Someone needs medical attention. Will you help?

05:58.959 --> 06:00.961
Sure, if I can.

06:02.362 --> 06:04.000
There goes your fishing.

06:04.064 --> 06:05.771
Okay, where is he?

06:06.633 --> 06:08.408
Well, he is some distance.

06:10.637 --> 06:11.672
And what's his name?

06:12.072 --> 06:13.210
Marios Guzman.

06:14.407 --> 06:15.579
No.

06:16.776 --> 06:20.053
She already asked me and I said, no.
And I'm saying it to you again.

06:20.247 --> 06:22.784
This time we must insist.

06:55.949 --> 06:57.223
Don't worry, Doc.

06:57.284 --> 06:58.786
I'll come after ya.

06:58.852 --> 07:00.160
No, no, please!

07:00.220 --> 07:02.860
It's my problem, Hawke.
Just stay away from this one.

07:15.068 --> 07:17.070
The hell I will.

07:23.143 --> 07:27.455
G-U-Z, Guzman. Goozman. Something like that.

07:27.514 --> 07:30.961
Marios Guzman. The former President of Suriana.

07:31.017 --> 07:33.793
A group of commandos just
busted him out of prison.

07:33.853 --> 07:36.663
What's this got to do with Doc Gifford?

07:37.123 --> 07:39.603
Well earlier, he was talking about old friends.

07:40.493 --> 07:42.996
I'll be willing to bet you
a brand new set of dry flies

07:43.063 --> 07:46.203
he's an unwilling passenger on his
way to South America right now.

07:47.167 --> 07:50.876
Then I guess those dry flies are
gonna stay dry for a while.

07:53.573 --> 07:55.018
Looks like it.

08:05.285 --> 08:07.561
Okay. Clear sailing.

08:08.588 --> 08:13.003
You know, we're gonna cross a different
country's airspace every 10 minutes down there.

08:13.059 --> 08:15.835
Thank God for radar suppression.

08:15.895 --> 08:19.900
I'm more concerned about
our reception in Suriana.

08:19.966 --> 08:22.003
I hope Archangel reached the Ambassador.

08:33.746 --> 08:35.488
Carlos, Carlos.

08:48.328 --> 08:50.365
Is it really possible?

08:53.533 --> 08:58.448
Tomas, can I speak to the
people one more time?

08:58.505 --> 08:59.984
We have the equipment.

09:00.040 --> 09:03.647
We have the will to do much
more than talk, Mr. President.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.547
What do you have in mind, Tomas?

09:07.614 --> 09:11.494
A demonstration of your continuing powers.

09:21.895 --> 09:26.173
I gave orders that no one was to be let in.

09:26.232 --> 09:27.905
I am Tomas Sanchez.

09:27.967 --> 09:29.469
I was your Father's Political Advisor.

09:29.536 --> 09:31.106
I know who you are.

09:34.407 --> 09:38.253
The fact is, you've compromised
security by coming here.

09:38.311 --> 09:41.485
There are patrols all over
the region. Jets in the sky.

09:41.548 --> 09:43.721
Then he has to be moved.

09:44.417 --> 09:47.523
Don't you tell me what I
must do with my Father.

09:49.923 --> 09:52.199
Luis, show him out.

09:53.693 --> 09:57.800
Tomas, we will talk later.

10:10.110 --> 10:14.559
Papa, you can't continue to see
people until you're better.

10:15.682 --> 10:18.322
Did you hear what Tomas said, mija?

10:20.053 --> 10:21.657
He said there is a way

10:22.455 --> 10:24.935
that I can broadcast to the people.

10:26.126 --> 10:29.767
I didn't get you out of the
hospital to revive your career.

10:30.497 --> 10:34.274
No, no. Nothing like that. Nothing. Just…

10:35.835 --> 10:40.045
Just a farewell from an old man.

10:44.611 --> 10:45.817
We'll see.

10:46.779 --> 10:49.055
Your friend, Jason Gifford,
is a jack of all trades.

10:49.115 --> 10:53.063
6 years ago, he was employed by
a local company as a crop duster.

10:53.119 --> 10:56.123
He met Marios Guzman at that time.

10:56.189 --> 10:59.398
Guzman was a popular revolutionary figure

10:59.459 --> 11:02.235
and Gifford flew some
non-combat missions for him.

11:02.295 --> 11:03.968
Guzman was a strange one.

11:04.030 --> 11:08.945
Suffers from liver ailments
but never trusted doctors.

11:09.002 --> 11:10.606
Only your friend, Gifford.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.741
He swore by this serum

11:12.805 --> 11:16.651
that he picked up at a quack
clinic across the border.

11:16.709 --> 11:20.282
Hansen's Clinic, maybe you've heard of it.

11:20.346 --> 11:22.724
What happened after he came to power?

11:22.782 --> 11:26.628
What always happens, absolute power.

11:27.954 --> 11:30.730
He was President for 5 years.

11:30.790 --> 11:33.600
A lonely, a sick man.

11:33.660 --> 11:36.038
Finally, the military threw him in prison.

11:36.095 --> 11:38.234
What happened to his daughter?

11:38.298 --> 11:40.642
Obviously, they patched up their differences.

11:41.968 --> 11:44.107
Why do you say that?

11:44.170 --> 11:47.276
Because she was the one
who broke him out of jail.

11:47.340 --> 11:49.581
Well, then where are they?

11:49.642 --> 11:52.452
Probably up in the Contadora District.

11:52.512 --> 11:54.788
He's still very popular up there.

11:54.847 --> 11:57.760
That's big, big territory to cover.

11:57.817 --> 12:00.423
Which brings me to my final point.

12:00.486 --> 12:02.762
This country is dangerous right now.

12:02.822 --> 12:05.735
My advice to you is to be very careful

12:05.792 --> 12:08.864
and do not take sides.

12:34.454 --> 12:37.594
Okay. There's a step here. Watch your step.

12:51.904 --> 12:55.716
Hello, Teresa. Nice of you to invite
me here on such short notice.

12:58.144 --> 13:00.784
I respect that you didn't want to come.

13:04.751 --> 13:08.722
Doc? Esté aqui? Doc?

13:15.428 --> 13:18.409
Oh, Doc. You're here.

13:19.565 --> 13:23.138
You're here, and you brought the serum. Oh!

13:25.038 --> 13:28.076
Teresa. Teresa.

13:28.141 --> 13:31.452
Come. Stand next to Doc.

13:31.511 --> 13:35.459
Like the old days. Make me a picture. Come.

13:40.620 --> 13:44.932
Oh, now

13:44.991 --> 13:48.336
everything is right.

13:48.394 --> 13:51.432
Everything is possible.

13:53.099 --> 13:54.635
Everything.

14:19.292 --> 14:22.671
Oh, it's a real circus down there, String.

14:22.729 --> 14:26.074
Yeah, well, they're worried about
more than just an escaped prisoner.

14:26.132 --> 14:27.873
He's a political threat, too.

14:27.934 --> 14:31.746
You know, guys, we have to remain
completely neutral in this situation.

14:32.905 --> 14:34.976
Yeah, if we can.

14:42.148 --> 14:44.059
Here we are, like the old days.

14:44.117 --> 14:45.118
The old days.

14:46.419 --> 14:48.729
Do you remember the old days the way I do?

14:48.788 --> 14:50.859
That excitement. That feeling
that anything was possible

14:50.923 --> 14:52.834
now that your revolution had been achieved.

14:52.892 --> 14:55.270
Peace. Equality. Justice.

14:55.328 --> 14:56.329
Love.

14:57.497 --> 15:00.103
Yeah, that, too.

15:00.166 --> 15:02.544
Why didn't you come back with me?

15:04.370 --> 15:06.976
You knew what he was becoming,
Teresa. You knew it.

15:07.907 --> 15:10.888
This is my country. He is my Father.

15:10.943 --> 15:12.786
How could I leave either
of them at that time?

15:12.845 --> 15:14.916
So who are you doing it for now,
your Father or your country?

15:14.981 --> 15:17.689
This is not a political act, Jason.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.696
They were killing him in that hospital.

15:19.752 --> 15:20.992
I begged them.

15:21.053 --> 15:23.124
I tried all the proper channels,

15:23.189 --> 15:26.295
the international committees,
nothing made any difference.

15:26.359 --> 15:28.032
I had to take action.

15:30.763 --> 15:35.041
Now he's in your hands. I'm glad.

15:35.101 --> 15:36.671
Even if it's wrong.

15:38.471 --> 15:41.418
Teresa, I gotta tell you the truth.

15:41.474 --> 15:42.646
Doc, don't…

15:42.708 --> 15:46.281
The serum that your Father believes in so much

15:46.345 --> 15:48.791
is absolutely worthless.

15:48.848 --> 15:50.259
It worked before.

15:50.316 --> 15:51.659
No, it didn't.

15:51.717 --> 15:53.754
He seemed to improve.

15:55.922 --> 15:58.528
You just wanted to believe it, but it didn't.

15:59.091 --> 16:00.570
I'm so sorry.

16:02.328 --> 16:05.639
You can make him well. He trusts you.

16:07.099 --> 16:09.545
Teresa, what happens when he dies?

16:11.904 --> 16:15.511
You're free to go. I give you my word.

16:20.813 --> 16:24.124
Do you realize that since
Marios Guzman was taken from prison,

16:24.183 --> 16:26.993
I've had the police, the
army, and the secret police

16:27.053 --> 16:31.365
of 2 nations flying in here at
all hours to ask a few questions?

16:31.424 --> 16:33.062
My patients are delicate.

16:34.560 --> 16:37.734
I hate to think what all this
is doing to my cure ratio.

16:39.098 --> 16:41.942
What about your most famous patient, Doctor?

16:43.236 --> 16:45.216
I wish the President a speedy recovery.

16:46.105 --> 16:48.676
But you won't admit to
supplying him with the stuff?

16:49.675 --> 16:53.748
A man in my position must be
circumspect, do you understand?

16:56.048 --> 16:57.584
Doctor, we're just trying to find our friend.

16:57.650 --> 17:00.130
We really don't have anything
to do with politics.

17:01.387 --> 17:04.993
A group of young men came
here yesterday for serum.

17:05.057 --> 17:06.194
Gifford was with them.

17:06.259 --> 17:10.263
I remembered him from the times he
used to fly Guzman here for treatment.

17:10.329 --> 17:13.070
They left, and I don't know where.

17:13.132 --> 17:15.339
Well, thank you very much, Doctor.

17:19.204 --> 17:21.242
Look, could I say something?

17:22.441 --> 17:24.045
He must be terminal this time.

17:25.111 --> 17:26.646
Your friend hasn't a chance.

17:28.146 --> 17:29.751
Is this the stuff?

17:29.815 --> 17:31.556
Oh, careful. That's radioactive.

17:32.451 --> 17:34.192
Oh, radioactive, huh?

17:51.437 --> 17:53.383
Another village com’n up, String.

17:53.439 --> 17:55.976
This is number 11. How long is it gonna take?

17:56.042 --> 17:58.215
As long as it takes.

18:05.418 --> 18:09.025
Bingo. That's gotta be it. In that house.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.567
You know, we can’t just go in there shoot’n.

18:10.623 --> 18:13.365
There's no telling what might happen to Doc.

18:13.426 --> 18:16.373
No, I'll fly off about a mile
or so and set her down.

18:16.429 --> 18:17.772
And then what?

18:18.898 --> 18:20.707
You two wait for my signal.

18:20.766 --> 18:23.246
Yeah, I was afraid you'd say that.

18:23.302 --> 18:25.043
There's probably a rebel army down there.

18:25.104 --> 18:26.344
How are you gonna get past ‘em?

18:26.405 --> 18:28.885
Easy, I'll pretend I'm not there.

19:09.048 --> 19:11.085
Those old windows never have
fit like they should, sir.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.187
Don't apologize.

19:15.988 --> 19:17.990
May I say something, sir?

19:20.059 --> 19:23.131
I want you to know I was there,

19:24.330 --> 19:27.402
in the city, the day your troops marched in.

19:28.934 --> 19:31.471
September 10.

19:31.704 --> 19:33.411
It's a day I shall never forget.

19:34.840 --> 19:37.218
People dancing in the streets, barefoot,

19:37.910 --> 19:39.446
even in the cold.

19:40.813 --> 19:42.292
The revolution was at hand.

19:43.249 --> 19:47.288
And I said then, "I'm going
to join our Presidente."

19:49.622 --> 19:51.124
And here I am.

19:54.193 --> 19:55.570
It's a fond memory.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.099
Thank you, Emilio.

20:05.905 --> 20:09.409
What about you, Doc? You were there, too.

20:10.176 --> 20:13.623
Do you remember it fondly,
the 10th of September?

20:13.679 --> 20:16.091
Look, just lie still, please.

20:16.148 --> 20:19.755
You see Tomas, Doc blames me

20:20.619 --> 20:24.692
that the people eventually felt the
cold of the streets on their bare feet.

20:26.358 --> 20:28.235
That's not what happened, is it?

20:28.627 --> 20:32.040
The cold they felt was your turning
against them. That's what happened.

20:33.733 --> 20:37.875
You see Tomas, Doc has never been married.

20:38.804 --> 20:40.784
He doesn't know about honeymoons,

20:40.906 --> 20:42.908
that they don't last forever.

20:43.976 --> 20:46.217
And he's never ruled a nation.

20:47.413 --> 20:51.327
He doesn't know that events rule the man

20:51.383 --> 20:54.421
and rarely the other way around.

20:56.322 --> 20:59.735
Well, I still believe that we have
something to say about what happens to us.

21:04.797 --> 21:07.573
Hawke! How the hell did you find me here?

21:07.633 --> 21:09.635
You smell like fish.

21:09.702 --> 21:11.807
Next time you clean ‘em,
wash your hands better.

21:11.871 --> 21:13.179
Who are you?

21:13.239 --> 21:14.946
He's a friend, Señor Presidente.

21:15.007 --> 21:16.350
He's an American.

21:22.581 --> 21:23.821
Come on, let's go.

21:23.883 --> 21:25.055
We'll never make it.

21:25.117 --> 21:26.892
Yeah we will, I've got the lady along.

21:26.952 --> 21:28.124
Papa!

21:28.187 --> 21:29.495
Hold it right there!

21:29.555 --> 21:31.330
Get your hand off your weapon.

21:33.592 --> 21:34.969
Come on, let's go.

21:35.027 --> 21:37.337
Doc, you can't leave me.

21:38.030 --> 21:40.943
String, I gotta stay awhile
and look after the old man.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.843
Doc, this guy kidnapped you.

21:44.103 --> 21:47.710
I'm gonna see this through
as long as he goes free.

21:49.975 --> 21:51.648
I'm not buy’n that.

21:52.444 --> 21:55.186
If I have her word, you can buy it.

21:58.083 --> 21:59.494
Go ahead.

22:00.820 --> 22:03.960
Doc can leave in a week,
no matter what happens.

22:07.159 --> 22:08.604
Okay.

22:34.086 --> 22:35.656
You can't be serious.

22:35.721 --> 22:37.257
Forget him, Tomas.

22:37.323 --> 22:38.802
Doc is an American.

22:38.858 --> 22:41.600
Their own necks are all they care about.

22:41.660 --> 22:44.971
It's insane, Teresa.
He'll go right to the Junta.

22:45.030 --> 22:47.567
I gave Doc my word. Doc gave me his.

22:49.034 --> 22:51.810
Your word? A word?

22:53.072 --> 22:56.053
Did you tell the hospital
you were a holy sister?

22:57.276 --> 23:00.621
Did you tell your Father he
would live to be 100 years old?

23:01.780 --> 23:03.225
Don't let him go.

23:06.185 --> 23:10.725
For God's sake Marios, tell
her this is the real world.

23:15.594 --> 23:17.631
It's her decision.

23:25.271 --> 23:26.909
So you're really gonna stay, huh?

23:26.972 --> 23:28.576
I can't talk you out of it?

23:28.641 --> 23:30.484
Well, it's a good place to work on my tan.

23:34.413 --> 23:36.450
Emilio! Luis!

23:38.884 --> 23:40.420
Teresa?

23:40.486 --> 23:42.523
Dom, lift off. Code Fire.

23:44.123 --> 23:45.193
What's Code Fire?

23:45.257 --> 23:48.136
You go to hell, all of ya.

23:52.197 --> 23:54.234
So much for your word.

24:20.092 --> 24:24.006
Now you are beginning to see.

24:24.863 --> 24:27.139
You must be a realist.

24:30.936 --> 24:33.177
You had no more choice

24:33.639 --> 24:36.916
than I had when I was President.

24:36.976 --> 24:41.516
Events rule us, not the other way around.

24:48.120 --> 24:50.623
Look at this storm.

24:50.689 --> 24:53.568
Even the gods are on our side.

24:54.727 --> 24:58.971
On our side, Papa? Are you mad?

24:59.832 --> 25:02.676
I mean that

25:02.735 --> 25:06.114
there can be no air search in such weather.

25:06.171 --> 25:07.980
There, that's what I mean.

25:12.945 --> 25:16.722
Papa, I feel alien here.

25:16.782 --> 25:21.094
Whatever happened to trust,
to keeping a promise?

25:23.088 --> 25:25.432
What happened to Doc's friend?

25:26.759 --> 25:29.239
Why didn't you let him go?

25:29.294 --> 25:31.535
Why did you keep the advantage?

25:34.400 --> 25:38.542
You're not an alien, you're Teresa Guzman.

25:40.539 --> 25:42.576
This is your home.

25:45.210 --> 25:48.350
You're my daughter, my heir,

25:49.515 --> 25:50.687
my revenge.

26:06.632 --> 26:08.441
I've never heard of Code Fire.

26:08.500 --> 26:11.640
It means, "Get me out," if he's in trouble.

26:11.703 --> 26:13.512
And what if he can't get out in time?

26:13.572 --> 26:15.711
Then we do whatever is
necessary to get him out.

26:15.774 --> 26:17.310
Make sure he doesn't suffer.

26:17.376 --> 26:19.253
If he's being abused.

26:19.311 --> 26:20.847
Our intelligence reports

26:20.913 --> 26:23.621
that Guzman's planning to
address the nation on the radio.

26:23.682 --> 26:27.459
If he calls for violence, we could find
ourselves in the middle of a civil war.

26:30.122 --> 26:32.568
Just make sure you don't start it.

26:53.011 --> 26:56.720
My children, the crying need

26:56.782 --> 27:01.128
for reform and revolution in this nation

27:01.520 --> 27:04.501
has not disappeared magically

27:04.556 --> 27:06.661
under the present government.

27:07.860 --> 27:10.170
It exists.

27:10.262 --> 27:13.732
No, it more than exists,

27:13.999 --> 27:15.000
it flourishes.

27:16.435 --> 27:20.611
The same spirit that enabled us to fight

27:20.672 --> 27:23.152
against impossible odds.

27:24.243 --> 27:28.350
That same spirit that danced barefoot

27:28.413 --> 27:30.825
in the cold streets

27:30.883 --> 27:35.059
but felt only the warmth of freedom.

27:38.357 --> 27:41.634
I will be with you always

27:41.693 --> 27:46.039
and always ready if you call.

27:48.634 --> 27:50.545
A wonderful speech, my President.

27:50.602 --> 27:53.276
Thank you, Tomas. Now
prepare to broadcast this.

27:53.338 --> 27:55.011
Yes, my President.

28:01.046 --> 28:04.050
That didn't sound like a farewell speech to me.

28:08.053 --> 28:10.226
Who can say?

28:31.610 --> 28:33.612
Give me a gun.

29:38.710 --> 29:39.984
- Doc.
- Yeah?

29:40.045 --> 29:41.046
You cover my tail.

29:41.113 --> 29:42.114
Got it.

30:19.284 --> 30:20.695
Emilio!

30:30.662 --> 30:32.938
You got any more friends like this one?

30:32.998 --> 30:35.410
Do you realize this man just saved your lives?

30:35.467 --> 30:39.142
I'm grateful. They probably radioed for help.

30:39.204 --> 30:42.048
Get the stretcher, we'll take the back road.

30:42.107 --> 30:44.348
You're all soldier now, aren't you?

30:44.409 --> 30:46.411
Help them with the stretcher.

31:23.081 --> 31:24.458
Luis.

31:34.993 --> 31:36.336
Doc, let's rest a moment.

31:36.395 --> 31:37.396
That's it.

31:39.865 --> 31:42.471
String, String.

31:45.003 --> 31:46.880
I don't like what you're thinking.

31:46.938 --> 31:49.646
We'll never have a better chance
than right now, my friend. Come on.

31:49.708 --> 31:51.710
They'll cut us down before we're halfway there.

31:51.777 --> 31:53.882
They got other things to think about. Come on.

31:53.945 --> 31:54.980
I don't know.

31:55.046 --> 31:56.787
Come on. We can separate.

31:56.848 --> 31:59.988
I'll meet you back at the home of
the American Ambassador, okay?

32:01.520 --> 32:02.965
I promise.

32:08.727 --> 32:10.604
Will you move?

32:36.922 --> 32:40.369
You were right, Doc.
They never got off a shot.

32:40.425 --> 32:42.132
Doc?

32:47.766 --> 32:49.268
Doc?

33:03.882 --> 33:06.362
Coming up on the village. All scanners on.

33:16.094 --> 33:17.732
Hey, I don't like the looks of this.

33:17.796 --> 33:19.002
What do you mean?

33:19.064 --> 33:23.535
Well, I read one shot-up house. There's
still some radioactive concentra…

33:23.602 --> 33:26.583
I've got one body down there moving.

33:32.777 --> 33:33.915
Come in Airwolf!

33:34.379 --> 33:35.790
Hawke?

33:35.847 --> 33:36.985
Hey, you all right?

33:37.048 --> 33:38.220
I'm fine.

33:38.283 --> 33:39.387
Doc got me out.

33:39.451 --> 33:40.862
But we lost him again.

33:40.919 --> 33:42.523
I'll meet you at the landing site.

33:46.024 --> 33:47.367
Let's go, Cate.

35:27.492 --> 35:29.631
We pick up Doc tracing the old man.

35:29.694 --> 35:31.833
Then we swing back to the
Ambassador's for Caitlin.

35:31.896 --> 35:33.842
She understands. We need the room.

36:25.150 --> 36:26.788
What is all that stuff?

36:26.851 --> 36:28.626
It's for the broadcast.

36:28.687 --> 36:32.134
The weather balloon takes the antenna aloft.

36:32.190 --> 36:34.602
And from here we can reach
nearly the whole country.

36:47.806 --> 36:52.152
I have… I have no more serum.

36:52.811 --> 36:55.485
The serum didn't work anyway.

36:55.547 --> 36:58.391
It was always Doc who got you through.

36:58.450 --> 37:01.090
And you, you're a fighter.

37:01.152 --> 37:03.792
You always were. Fight now!

37:06.624 --> 37:09.798
My little, little Teresa.

37:11.796 --> 37:15.835
Doc, you understand.

37:16.634 --> 37:18.079
Explain.

37:26.778 --> 37:28.382
Come here.

37:40.225 --> 37:42.205
He's not gonna make it, you know?

37:43.161 --> 37:44.663
I know.

37:45.530 --> 37:48.909
Thank you for letting my friend Hawke go.

37:53.071 --> 37:56.644
All I ever wanted was to get my
Father to a decent hospital.

37:58.409 --> 38:00.047
Look at me now.

38:00.879 --> 38:03.758
An armed fugitive, you and I enemies.

38:05.216 --> 38:06.217
No.

38:07.986 --> 38:11.058
Once we broadcast, who knows?

38:11.122 --> 38:14.763
My Father was right. Events
will just overtake us.

38:18.763 --> 38:20.902
I am his revenge,

38:22.801 --> 38:24.838
his heir.

38:37.782 --> 38:41.093
It's okay Papa, relax.

39:22.627 --> 39:24.800
Telefonos Contadora?

39:26.898 --> 39:28.935
Oh, my God.

39:32.637 --> 39:37.347
I was with you then, in the
mountains along the banks…

39:45.717 --> 39:48.789
There it is, bearing 195.

39:51.289 --> 39:52.791
Dom, give me turbos.

40:07.438 --> 40:08.644
…and in the barricades…

40:08.706 --> 40:11.243
Señorita Guzman,

40:11.309 --> 40:12.686
Emilio is dead.

40:14.512 --> 40:16.685
There are patrols out there, you gotta…

40:16.748 --> 40:20.355
…as we faced a common foe.

40:20.418 --> 40:23.888
We were invincible then.

40:23.955 --> 40:26.765
We were comrades. We were brothers…

40:26.824 --> 40:30.169
For you and for Emilio.

40:30.228 --> 40:34.005
When the last of our enemies has fallen

40:34.065 --> 40:38.946
and we ourselves are dust, our…

40:39.003 --> 40:40.914
I'll watch the road.

40:41.139 --> 40:44.143
Teresa, there are dynamite
boxes in the garage next door.

40:44.208 --> 40:46.711
They got detonator caps, wire.
What are they for?

40:47.645 --> 40:49.215
We didn't bring those.

40:49.280 --> 40:51.021
Now, what was the dynamite for?

40:51.082 --> 40:53.119
I don't know.

40:53.184 --> 40:57.155
My blood spilled with
yours as we faced a common…

40:57.221 --> 41:01.533
Look you, you were here when we got here.
You work for Sanchez, right?

41:01.592 --> 41:05.130
That same spirit that danced barefoot

41:05.463 --> 41:07.704
in the cold streets

41:07.765 --> 41:12.043
but felt only the warmth of freedom.

41:12.737 --> 41:14.614
That was a signal, wasn't it?

41:16.174 --> 41:17.812
Manuel?

41:20.778 --> 41:25.249
It's too late. It's too late
to stop the trucks now.

41:25.316 --> 41:27.023
You see, car bombs.

41:29.253 --> 41:30.596
Where? How many?

41:32.390 --> 41:37.066
The palace, the shipyard, the barracks.

41:37.428 --> 41:38.930
Well, that's 3. What's the other one?

41:39.063 --> 41:42.909
Sanchez, and he is driving that one himself.

41:42.967 --> 41:45.345
And he didn't say the target.

41:45.403 --> 41:47.713
That's the truth, I swear it.

41:49.474 --> 41:52.080
Teresa, you're the only one who can stop ‘em.

41:52.143 --> 41:53.622
Get on this microphone.

41:53.678 --> 41:54.679
All right.

41:54.746 --> 41:56.987
Bring this country back to its senses.

42:05.723 --> 42:08.226
This is Teresa Guzman.

42:17.135 --> 42:20.207
This is Teresa Guzman.

42:24.675 --> 42:26.552
We are helpless.

42:31.749 --> 42:33.228
Come on. Let's go.

42:52.503 --> 42:55.848
Easy with the mayhem, String. We don't
want to hurt anybody if we don't have to.

42:55.907 --> 42:57.545
I'm keeping ‘em honest.

43:05.116 --> 43:06.254
Honest?

43:30.141 --> 43:33.679
There are car bombs. The revolution
has to be stopped. Teresa can do it.

43:33.744 --> 43:37.715
She's gonna broadcast on the
government frequency, all right?

43:51.963 --> 43:54.569
We're all set on the government's frequency.

43:54.632 --> 43:57.408
This is Teresa Guzman.

43:57.468 --> 44:01.280
I am broadcasting to the people of Suriana.

44:01.339 --> 44:03.376
My Father is dead.

44:04.942 --> 44:09.721
His voice, which you heard moments
ago, was a tape recording, a trick.

44:09.780 --> 44:13.250
It is time for the conflict to end.

44:13.317 --> 44:15.126
There are men on missions of terrorism

44:15.186 --> 44:17.223
who believe they are acting
in the name of my Father.

44:17.288 --> 44:18.961
They're not.

44:26.097 --> 44:29.442
I implore you, before you reach your targets,

44:29.500 --> 44:32.310
destroy your vehicles in uninhabited areas.

44:32.370 --> 44:35.817
This is the legacy my
Father would truly cherish.

44:38.809 --> 44:40.880
I knew it. It was only a matter of time.

44:40.945 --> 44:44.415
Government F-4's, a pair of ‘em, clos’n fast.

44:44.482 --> 44:45.893
They'll shoot us down.

44:45.950 --> 44:47.623
They'll have to catch us first.

44:53.624 --> 44:56.662
Whatever happens, I thank you for trying.

44:56.761 --> 45:00.504
Trying, hell! I just
registered 3 ground explosions

45:00.565 --> 45:02.875
out in the middle of nowhere.

45:02.934 --> 45:04.379
Where's number 4?

45:04.435 --> 45:05.971
That must be Sanchez.

45:06.037 --> 45:07.948
He's pretty bitter against Americans.

45:08.005 --> 45:10.042
You suppose he'd go after the Embassy?

45:10.107 --> 45:11.814
It's too well protected.

45:11.876 --> 45:13.787
So what else do we have?

45:13.844 --> 45:15.653
The Ambassador's residence.

45:16.347 --> 45:18.088
My God, Caitlin's there.

45:38.536 --> 45:40.607
Hey, kids! Here, take my hand. Take my hand.

45:40.671 --> 45:42.082
Come on. Run! Run!

45:57.688 --> 45:59.190
More Phantoms at 9:00.

46:52.276 --> 46:54.119
Hey, you okay?

46:54.178 --> 46:56.658
Sure, after a taste of
Airwolf, they never come back.

46:56.714 --> 46:58.455
Where is señorita Guzman?

46:58.516 --> 47:00.962
We dropped her off back at
the Ambassador's house.

47:01.018 --> 47:03.294
Well, I guess you're going to
have to sit in my lap, Doc.

47:03.354 --> 47:05.766
Listen, I don't know what to say but…

47:05.823 --> 47:07.234
You're staying?

47:07.291 --> 47:09.669
For a few weeks, maybe longer.

47:09.727 --> 47:11.434
We understand.

47:11.495 --> 47:13.998
Hey, we got things we believe in, too.

47:16.867 --> 47:18.972
Okay. Thumbs up, everybody.

47:22.440 --> 47:24.010
Good bye.
