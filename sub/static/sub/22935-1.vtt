00:06.057 --> 00:09.226
- There's a time when the
operation of the machine

00:09.227 --> 00:11.466
becomes so odious,

00:11.467 --> 00:14.936
makes you so sick at heart
that you can't take part.

00:14.937 --> 00:17.236
You can't even
passively take part,

00:17.237 --> 00:19.735
and you've got to put
your bodies upon the gears

00:19.736 --> 00:22.136
and upon the wheels,
upon the levers,

00:22.146 --> 00:23.536
upon all the apparatus,

00:23.546 --> 00:25.246
and you've got to make it stop!

00:25.247 --> 00:31.947
♪

00:31.957 --> 00:34.586
- First, let me start by
saying Mario Savio's

00:34.587 --> 00:36.486
"Operation of the Machine"

00:36.487 --> 00:39.486
is one of my favorite
speeches of all time.

00:39.496 --> 00:43.495
Mario wasn't a politician
or some famous Hollywood star.

00:43.496 --> 00:46.665
He was just a student
who was for civil rights.

00:46.666 --> 00:48.535
He stood on a car at Berkley

00:48.536 --> 00:50.536
and screamed whatever
came into his head.

00:50.537 --> 00:52.667
He didn't care that he had
a stuttering problem

00:52.677 --> 00:55.537
or that he might get thrown
out of school, which he did.

00:55.547 --> 00:58.775
He just wanted
his voice to be heard

00:58.776 --> 01:03.245
and be unencumbered
by the machine.

01:03.246 --> 01:04.885
As an investigative
writer that has yet

01:04.885 --> 01:08.255
to be officially published,

01:08.256 --> 01:11.256
I can relate to Mario's desire.

01:12.761 --> 01:17.761
Subtitle Re-Synced to this release by SubSync.net

01:19.266 --> 01:21.565
That's me behind the wheel,

01:21.566 --> 01:26.166
Jay Bahadur, proud college
graduate of the class of 2007,

01:26.176 --> 01:28.105
arguably the worst year

01:28.106 --> 01:30.005
since the Great Depression
to graduate school,

01:30.006 --> 01:32.876
but timing was
never my strength.

01:37.645 --> 01:43.016
In fact, good timing seems to be
at odds with my very existence,

01:43.026 --> 01:46.186
but like many
unpleasantries in life,

01:46.196 --> 01:48.856
you just learn to deal with it.

- Afternoon, shoppers...
- Yo.

02:09.786 --> 02:12.984
Hey, man. Is Mark Reiss here?

02:12.985 --> 02:15.815
- Reissy? Oh, he left.
- Shit, really?

02:15.825 --> 02:17.015
- Yeah.
- Damn it,

02:17.025 --> 02:18.724
he was supposed to be here.

02:18.725 --> 02:20.324
- It's kind of lousy out,
if you didn't notice.

02:20.325 --> 02:23.355
He left early. Are you
interviewing for stock boy or...

02:23.365 --> 02:26.694
- Me? No.
- My name is Jay Bahadur.

02:26.695 --> 02:30.864
I'm doing market research
on premium napkins.

02:30.865 --> 02:33.204
Mind if I ask you
a few questions?

02:33.205 --> 02:39.244
- Your name isn't even on here.
- I assure you, I am legit.

02:39.245 --> 02:40.714
- You drove all the way
from Toronto

02:40.715 --> 02:43.244
to ask questions about napkins?

02:43.245 --> 02:47.145
- Premium napkins.
- Thought my job sucked.

02:47.155 --> 02:49.083
- Could you show your
paper product aisle?

02:49.084 --> 02:52.223
- But I'm just kind of busy.

02:52.224 --> 02:55.994
- Is there a reason why the six
...reason why the six pack

02:55.995 --> 02:58.295
This thing does not like me.

03:10.144 --> 03:14.213
Is there a reason why
the six pack paisley napkins

03:14.214 --> 03:21.014
are here and not here?

03:21.015 --> 03:22.984
It's not a trick question.

03:22.985 --> 03:25.423
- I... I think because it was just
easier putting them on the floor

03:25.424 --> 03:29.323
than on the top shelf.

03:29.324 --> 03:33.324
- And would making our packaging
more festive make you consider

03:33.334 --> 03:37.834
moving the premium napkins
to the top shelf?

03:42.274 --> 03:44.173
You're probably thinking

03:44.174 --> 03:46.004
that a person
with my intellectual capacity

03:46.014 --> 03:47.413
would loathe waiting for
that gentleman's answer

03:47.414 --> 03:49.443
to my question.

03:49.444 --> 03:52.983
But actually,
I feel quite the contrary.

03:52.984 --> 03:54.383
- I would just leave them
on the bottom shelf, man.

03:54.384 --> 03:57.253
- It's less work.
- Less work.

03:57.254 --> 03:59.923
Understanding what drives a mind
to react the way

03:59.924 --> 04:03.792
it does to things
never ceases to amaze me.

04:03.793 --> 04:07.392
My careful documentation of this
one man's opinion could,

04:07.393 --> 04:10.295
in its own way,
reshape the patterns of napkins

04:10.305 --> 04:15.934
on every home on this street,

04:15.944 --> 04:20.172
including that one,
my ex-high school girlfriend,

04:20.173 --> 04:22.712
Tracy Zicconi's house.

04:22.713 --> 04:25.042
The darkened second-floor
window just a reminder

04:25.043 --> 04:30.252
that she now resides
1,825 miles away at Stanford.

04:30.253 --> 04:33.022
And I know it's 1,825 miles away

04:33.023 --> 04:35.854
because I have an obsession
with Google Maps,

04:35.864 --> 04:38.723
not with my ex-high
school girlfriend.

04:47.403 --> 04:50.272
I was raised as a non-practicing
Hindu-Christian

04:50.273 --> 04:53.003
half-Indian living
at this address.

04:53.013 --> 04:56.512
This is the home of Kailash
and Maria Bahadur.

04:56.513 --> 04:58.843
My well-laid-out graduation plan

04:58.853 --> 05:00.852
was only to visit my former
residence on festive holidays

05:00.853 --> 05:03.852
such as Canadian
Thanksgiving and Christmas,

05:03.853 --> 05:08.392
perhaps offering my skills at
turkey basting or tree trimming,

05:08.393 --> 05:12.292
but this was 2008.

05:12.293 --> 05:14.792
Plans evaporated.

05:14.793 --> 05:18.031
Upon my graduation from the
esteemed University of Toronto,

05:18.032 --> 05:22.201
my parents had decided
to give me my own mailbox.

05:22.202 --> 05:24.302
They saw it as a way in which
to somehow legitimize

05:24.303 --> 05:27.203
my residence in their basement.

05:27.213 --> 05:28.942
The funny thing was
that the mailman

05:28.943 --> 05:30.312
refused to deliver
my mail there,

05:30.313 --> 05:32.212
so Mom would sort the mail

05:32.213 --> 05:34.782
and deliver it herself
after each delivery.

05:46.092 --> 05:48.131
"Dear Mr. Bahadur,
the editorial staff

05:48.132 --> 05:49.832
"at 'Vanity Fair' has reviewed
your story submission,

05:49.833 --> 05:53.201
"and we unfortunately do not
feel

05:53.202 --> 05:54.371
"it's something we would like
our magazine

05:54.372 --> 05:56.401
"to pursue at this time.

05:56.402 --> 05:57.542
We wish you the best of luck
at other publications..."

05:57.543 --> 06:00.371
Blah fucking blah.

06:00.372 --> 06:03.372
Why do all rejection letters
have the word "unfortunately"

06:03.382 --> 06:05.481
in the first sentence?

06:05.482 --> 06:09.212
Surely there is a more original
adverb to toss in there.

06:09.222 --> 06:13.482
I vow that I will never
write for a publication

06:13.492 --> 06:17.021
that uses the word
"unfortunately"

06:17.022 --> 06:20.022
in their first sentence.

06:20.032 --> 06:22.462
I am better than that.

06:47.192 --> 06:49.020
Come on.

06:49.021 --> 06:54.091
Jared? Jared?
Jared.

06:56.391 --> 06:59.161
- Is that my Red Bull?
- No.

06:59.171 --> 07:02.000
- Look at me.

07:02.001 --> 07:03.901
- Mom says you got to shovel
the snow in the driveway

07:03.902 --> 07:05.602
so Dad can get in.

07:05.612 --> 07:07.340
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.

07:07.341 --> 07:11.380
- You're not doing anything.
- Doing homework.

07:11.381 --> 07:14.610
- Uh, where's mom?
- The elusive pink

07:14.611 --> 07:17.211
fairy armadillo
has been known to...

07:17.221 --> 07:19.881
- Mom? Mom?

07:19.891 --> 07:21.350
- Yeah?

07:21.351 --> 07:23.551
- Why do I have to
shovel the driveway?

07:23.561 --> 07:27.359
- Your father and I
discussed this with you, Jay,

07:27.360 --> 07:31.260
about ways for you
to contribute rent, remember?

07:31.261 --> 07:34.471
And I'm so sorry about
your rejection letter.

07:35.401 --> 07:38.141
Ahh!

07:39.941 --> 07:43.110
- Yo!
- Ahh!

07:43.111 --> 07:46.509
Are you, like, earning some
extra allowance or something?

07:46.510 --> 07:48.649
- I'm starting to wonder why
I didn't commit teen suicide

07:48.650 --> 07:50.479
- when I could.
- Amen.

07:50.480 --> 07:53.320
Yo, bro, you want to, like,
hit Parrots with us?

07:53.321 --> 07:55.590
- Can't. I got to submit
my research numbers.

07:55.591 --> 07:57.320
They got to be
in Chicago by tomorrow.

07:57.321 --> 07:59.260
- Then fake it.
- I can't, man.

07:59.261 --> 08:01.660
They figure out all sorts
of stuff based off my results.

08:01.661 --> 08:04.159
- Like what?
- Like what holiday paisleys

08:04.160 --> 08:05.999
are popular and stuff.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.699
- Okay, bro, you lost me.

08:07.700 --> 08:09.330
- Journalistic integrity,

08:09.340 --> 08:10.969
it's gonna be worth
something on the resume

08:10.970 --> 08:12.600
when I apply to Harvard's
journalism school.

08:12.610 --> 08:16.509
- Right, right.
- Hey, I got an idea for a story

08:16.510 --> 08:17.940
I'm gonna submit.
It came to me when I was

08:17.941 --> 08:19.710
listening to CBC Radio today.

08:19.711 --> 08:21.279
- What's... what's the angle?

08:21.280 --> 08:23.479
- The end of the comedic
dictator.

08:23.480 --> 08:26.449
Kim Jong is on his death bed,
and once he goes,

08:26.450 --> 08:29.619
where's the dictator
comedy gonna come from?

08:29.620 --> 08:33.359
- Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
- He's funny and very alive.

08:33.360 --> 08:35.229
- He's not funny.

08:35.230 --> 08:37.229
- He's a little funny.

08:37.230 --> 08:39.559
- He's a little funny, but no
one can pronounce his name.

08:39.570 --> 08:42.068
- Your story is flawed, bro.

08:42.068 --> 08:45.039
- You guys want to hear
something fucked up?

08:45.040 --> 08:47.969
Tracy's getting engaged.

08:47.970 --> 08:51.139
- Where did you hear that shit?
- Mm, Kate.

08:51.140 --> 08:54.040
She said she saw
it posted on Facebook.

08:54.050 --> 08:57.249
She's gonna marry her
Lit professor.

08:57.250 --> 09:00.148
- No way. Tracy is repulsed
by older men.

09:00.149 --> 09:01.388
- You were older.

09:01.389 --> 09:03.588
- Two years is not older, man!

09:03.589 --> 09:05.588
- It's a little bit older.

09:05.589 --> 09:08.029
- Fuck you, Crowe.

09:08.030 --> 09:11.229
- Hey, are you sure you don't
want to hit Parrots with us?

09:11.230 --> 09:12.760
- No, dude, I got to...

09:12.770 --> 09:16.599
- Do some shit nobody
gives a fuck about?

09:16.600 --> 09:18.498
- Exactly.

09:18.499 --> 09:20.538
- All right, well,
that is your loss,

09:20.539 --> 09:24.708
but if you change your mind,
please hit us up.

09:24.709 --> 09:27.748
- You got it. Later, dudes.
- See you, buddy.

09:27.749 --> 09:31.278
- See you.

09:31.279 --> 09:34.590
- Fucking moron.
- What?

09:39.019 --> 09:41.659
- Ahh! Ahh!

09:44.729 --> 09:46.428
- Name's Bahadur, here

09:46.429 --> 09:48.098
to see Dr. Fleshman
about my back.

09:48.099 --> 09:50.268
- Have you ever been here
before?

09:50.269 --> 09:52.038
- No.
- All right, you'll just need

09:52.039 --> 09:56.237
- to fill out these forms.
- Right.

09:56.238 --> 09:57.408
- You okay?

09:57.409 --> 10:00.378
- Yeah, I just hurt my back,

10:00.379 --> 10:02.709
figured I'd get a jump
on being a senior citizen.

10:10.189 --> 10:15.088
- So, you busting on grey hairs?
- To make a move on Kaitlyn, eh?

10:18.528 --> 10:20.527
- Excuse me?

10:20.528 --> 10:22.429
- That's all right,
I understand.

10:22.439 --> 10:26.468
I'd take down all of humanity
just to bang her.

10:26.469 --> 10:30.438
- Seymour.
- Ooh. I was just talking.

10:30.439 --> 10:32.807
I'm trying to keep it
a level playing field.

10:32.808 --> 10:34.847
- Yeah, leave him alone.
- You know what I'm saying.

10:34.848 --> 10:38.447
Sorry. What happened
to your back?

10:38.448 --> 10:41.147
- Sh-shoveling.
- Shoveling?

10:41.148 --> 10:45.117
- Yeah.
- I got, uh, shrapnel moving

10:45.118 --> 10:47.258
around the vertebrae.

10:47.259 --> 10:49.328
It's a bitch.

10:49.329 --> 10:51.397
- Well, sounds like I got the
better end of the deal in here.

10:51.398 --> 10:53.358
- Oh, bullshit.

10:53.368 --> 10:59.398
Shoveling? I hate shoveling.
Pointless waste of time, no?

10:59.408 --> 11:02.407
Name's Seymour Tolbin.

11:02.408 --> 11:05.537
- Ah.
- Oh, oh, sorry.

11:05.538 --> 11:10.346
- Wait, Seymour Tolbin?
- Yeah.

11:10.347 --> 11:12.447
- The... who writes for
"The Daily Mail?"

11:12.448 --> 11:15.247
- Wrote.
- I'm retired, sort of.

11:15.248 --> 11:17.317
But that's right. That's me.

11:17.318 --> 11:18.887
- Holy fuck.

11:18.888 --> 11:23.127
You are one of my favorite
journalists of all time.

11:23.128 --> 11:26.427
- Come on. You Facebook people
have favorite journalists?

11:26.428 --> 11:28.726
- You were one of the
first reporters who had the guts

11:28.727 --> 11:31.466
to report the Battle of
Ong Thanh as a loss.

11:31.467 --> 11:35.166
- That's...
- So you're a journalist?

11:35.167 --> 11:37.137
- No. Well, I mean, yeah,
I want to be,

11:37.138 --> 11:39.438
but I can't... I just... you know,

11:39.448 --> 11:42.547
I haven't taken a...
I never took a class,

11:42.548 --> 11:44.917
but I'm seriously... I'm thinking
about going back

11:44.918 --> 11:46.346
to get a degree.

11:46.347 --> 11:48.586
Harvard is the... is the goal.

11:48.587 --> 11:52.617
- Oh, how can you say
something stupid like that?

11:52.627 --> 11:55.227
- What...
- Why do you think journalism

11:55.228 --> 11:56.887
is a pile of "People" magazine,

11:56.897 --> 12:02.327
"She got cellulite on her
Dumpster" crap right now?

12:02.328 --> 12:05.897
Journalism isn't taught.
It's innate.

12:05.907 --> 12:08.236
You know what I'm saying?

12:08.237 --> 12:11.376
You think the shrapnel
in my back landed there

12:11.377 --> 12:14.476
because I was using my head?

12:14.477 --> 12:16.346
No way.

12:16.347 --> 12:19.416
- So what are you saying?
- I'm saying fuck Harvard,

12:19.417 --> 12:21.316
is what I'm saying.

12:21.317 --> 12:23.485
Fuck Harvard.

12:23.486 --> 12:28.386
You want to make it as some big
swinging dick journalist?

12:28.387 --> 12:33.226
You got to go somewhere
fucking crazy.

12:33.227 --> 12:35.296
- Somewhere where Western
reporters would consider

12:35.297 --> 12:37.196
it too dangerous to go,

12:37.197 --> 12:41.465
like, write as a stringer
from there, get a book going.

12:41.466 --> 12:42.966
It's the only way out.

12:42.976 --> 12:47.536
- Yeah, that makes sense, man.
- That makes sense.

12:47.546 --> 12:51.515
Where you thinking of going?

12:51.516 --> 12:56.416
- Somalia.

12:56.417 --> 12:58.316
- Hmm?
- Like, I... I bought a...

12:58.317 --> 13:01.985
An umbrella from a Somali once.

13:01.986 --> 13:03.725
- What does that mean?

13:03.726 --> 13:05.655
- That means where's
the fucking conflict,

13:05.656 --> 13:08.225
besides the fact that they
machete reporters to death?

13:08.226 --> 13:09.626
- In Somalia the seeds
of democracy

13:09.636 --> 13:11.295
are growing amidst anarchy.

13:11.296 --> 13:12.835
I did a paper on it
my freshman year.

13:12.836 --> 13:14.835
- So?

13:14.836 --> 13:16.967
- So it's a misunderstood place.

13:16.977 --> 13:20.005
- Bro, democracy is not topical,
all right?

13:20.006 --> 13:22.745
No... nobody wants
to understand Somalia.

13:22.746 --> 13:26.615
- Did you know in Somaliland
they held an election

13:26.616 --> 13:31.485
where the minority clan won the
presidential office by 80 votes,

13:31.486 --> 13:33.516
and there was no violence?

13:33.526 --> 13:35.685
The transition of power
was peaceful.

13:35.686 --> 13:38.794
- It was peaceful because nobody
bothered reporting on it.

13:38.795 --> 13:43.665
You need to listen to me.
You want conflict?

13:43.666 --> 13:46.935
You want to tell the story
from both sides?

13:46.936 --> 13:48.805
Go to Sudan.

13:48.806 --> 13:53.675
There's your ticket,
not Somalia.

13:53.676 --> 13:58.014
- I don't know, man. I got
a good grade on that paper.

13:58.015 --> 14:00.975
Somalia and me are copacetic.

14:00.985 --> 14:03.314
Is a Mr. Trey Williamson here?

14:03.315 --> 14:05.714
- Just left.
- Shit, really?

14:05.715 --> 14:07.855
My name is, uh, Jay Bahadur.

14:07.856 --> 14:09.525
I'm here to conduct
a marketing research...

14:09.526 --> 14:12.355
- Who's the guy eating Doritos
on my aisle?

14:12.356 --> 14:16.025
- That's my associate,
Mr. Felcher.

14:16.035 --> 14:19.064
- I have to clean that shit up.
- I'm so sorry, man.

14:19.065 --> 14:20.895
- Would you please...
- Continue maestro.

14:20.905 --> 14:23.804
- Refrain from eating
in this poor man's aisle?

14:23.805 --> 14:25.404
And just start to pick that up.

14:25.405 --> 14:26.405
- I got it.
- Thank you.

14:26.406 --> 14:27.804
- I got it.

14:27.805 --> 14:30.644
- And where is your, uh,
napkin aisle?

14:30.645 --> 14:32.375
- Aisle seven.
- Seven.

14:32.376 --> 14:34.314
- Hey, uh, Jay?

14:34.315 --> 14:35.944
I think you should
check this shit out.

14:35.945 --> 14:38.084
- I thought we agreed
you would be silent, bro.

14:38.085 --> 14:41.655
- No, bro, I really think
you should check this out.

14:43.425 --> 14:47.425
Would you excuse me
for a moment? Thank you.

14:47.795 --> 14:49.725
- What the fuck, man?
- The rebels,

14:49.735 --> 14:51.563
who Kenyan officials
liken to seagoing pirates

14:51.564 --> 14:54.064
have taken captive the MV Faina,

14:54.065 --> 14:56.804
a Ukrainian vessel,
off the Somali coast,

14:56.805 --> 14:59.474
and they're demanding
an untold ransom.

14:59.475 --> 15:01.844
Our correspondent, Mitch Kelp,
has more on the story

15:01.845 --> 15:05.374
from outside the U.S.
embassy in Nairobi.

15:05.375 --> 15:07.475
Mitch, what more
can you tell us?

15:07.485 --> 15:09.084
- Well, Chrissy,
not a whole lot.

15:09.085 --> 15:10.983
We are going off
an official press release

15:10.984 --> 15:12.853
from the Kenyan government.

15:12.854 --> 15:14.953
We don't have
a single source in Somalia,

15:14.954 --> 15:16.923
and I'm sure as shit not gonna
get my ass shot over there

15:16.924 --> 15:19.523
trying to find out
what would possess these, um...

15:19.524 --> 15:21.724
Possess these crackheads
to take an unarmed tanker.

15:21.725 --> 15:24.564
- Hmm. Well, Mitch, word here is
our corporate insurance policy

15:24.565 --> 15:26.495
wouldn't cover you
in that hellhole,

15:26.505 --> 15:28.503
and they'd hate to have
a lawsuit from your family

15:28.504 --> 15:31.703
on their hands when they mail
you back in pieces.

15:31.704 --> 15:34.703
- Thank corporate for
being so considerate, Chrissy.

15:34.704 --> 15:37.043
Back to you.

15:37.044 --> 15:40.574
- So until we can find
one crazy motherfucker

15:40.584 --> 15:43.944
to head over to Somalia
and find out what's going on,

15:43.954 --> 15:47.053
we'll continue to take
uneducated guesses

15:47.054 --> 15:50.684
as to who these pirates are.

15:50.694 --> 15:53.454
Bahadur, answer the phone!

15:53.464 --> 15:55.763
- And you've got to put
your bodies upon the gears

15:55.764 --> 15:59.533
and upon the wheels...

15:59.534 --> 16:00.894
- Hello?

16:00.904 --> 16:03.633
- Hello?
- Is this Mr. Jay Bahadur?

16:03.634 --> 16:05.573
- Yeah.
- This is Mohamad Farole

16:05.574 --> 16:08.542
from Radio Garowe
over in Somalia.

16:08.543 --> 16:10.503
I got your email.

16:10.513 --> 16:12.743
So you are wanting to come
to Somalia for a book.

16:12.744 --> 16:14.743
You are writing on the pirates,

16:14.744 --> 16:16.944
and you're looking for people
to talk to here, right?

16:16.954 --> 16:19.814
- Yes, exactly.
- I must say that is more than

16:19.824 --> 16:22.984
any other reporter
has been willing to do.

16:22.994 --> 16:24.992
You are the first Westerner

16:24.993 --> 16:27.553
to actually ask to come see
what's going on here.

16:27.563 --> 16:30.792
- That's unfortunate.
- Yes, yes, it's true.

16:30.793 --> 16:32.962
I'll have a conversation
with my father,

16:32.963 --> 16:35.732
- accommodate your request.
- Okay, okay.

16:35.733 --> 16:38.903
And, uh, how... uh,
you think your father

16:38.904 --> 16:41.644
will be able
to make this happen?

16:41.645 --> 16:44.703
- I would hope so.
- He is our president.

16:50.713 --> 16:54.852
- Assalamu alaikum.
- Uhh.

16:54.853 --> 16:57.522
- That's Somali for hello.

16:57.523 --> 17:01.962
I suggest you learn it, Bahadur.
I'm out of cigars.

17:01.963 --> 17:04.592
Want to walk with me?

17:04.593 --> 17:06.632
- Okay.

17:06.633 --> 17:07.962
Yeah, this guy Farole called.

17:07.963 --> 17:09.663
I just sent out some feelers

17:09.673 --> 17:11.132
to a few Somali news
services, and boom.

17:11.133 --> 17:13.032
- The president's son
calls you back.

17:13.042 --> 17:14.571
- Yes! I never

17:14.573 --> 17:16.041
get a break like that, never.

17:16.042 --> 17:18.712
- Well, uh, you create
your own reality, chief.

17:18.713 --> 17:19.872
- Well, if that was true,
we would all live

17:19.882 --> 17:21.540
in a solipsistic universe

17:21.541 --> 17:22.942
wherein we could do
whatever we wanted

17:22.952 --> 17:24.541
without any further
consequences.

17:24.551 --> 17:26.613
- What the fuck
are you talking about?

17:26.623 --> 17:28.722
- Michael Topper, author of
"Channeling UFOs"

17:28.723 --> 17:30.822
and "The Positive/Negative
Realms Beyond This World?"

17:30.823 --> 17:33.692
- You read too much.
- Fuck more girls, instead.

17:33.693 --> 17:40.061
Speaking of which, I read
that writing sample you gave me.

17:40.062 --> 17:41.961
- Bad?

17:41.962 --> 17:44.931
- Why the fuck would you
write a piece

17:44.932 --> 17:48.841
on how to get away
without paying parking tickets?

17:48.842 --> 17:51.042
- I thought people would laugh.
- Laugh?

17:51.043 --> 17:53.743
Parking tickets pay
for the roads.

17:53.744 --> 17:56.681
The roads get you
out of this shit hole.

17:56.682 --> 17:59.281
- So you hated it?
- No, actually.

17:59.282 --> 18:01.112
I liked it.

18:01.122 --> 18:04.251
It's not the second
coming of Hunter S. Thompson,

18:04.252 --> 18:08.561
but you write
with a good conscience.

18:08.562 --> 18:09.791
- You think?
- Yeah.

18:09.792 --> 18:12.061
Don't let it go to your head.

18:12.062 --> 18:15.100
Bravo.

18:15.101 --> 18:20.301
So Avril Benoit,
you know who she is?

18:20.302 --> 18:22.271
- Yeah, uh, she's on CBC Radio.

18:22.272 --> 18:24.741
She did a great report
on Kenya a few weeks ago.

18:24.742 --> 18:28.842
- Exactly.
- She's a friend of mine, uh,

18:28.843 --> 18:33.281
and I want to put you
in contact with her.

18:33.282 --> 18:34.980
- Okay.

18:34.981 --> 18:38.650
- She's a good one
for feeding pages to.

18:38.651 --> 18:42.321
So you got... you got
a book outline?

18:42.322 --> 18:44.222
- No.
- Wrong.

18:44.232 --> 18:47.031
You're formulating one, okay?

18:47.032 --> 18:49.301
- I haven't. I mean, this is
all happening so fast.

18:49.302 --> 18:51.571
I just... I Googled
"Somalia press,"

18:51.572 --> 18:53.100
found Farole's name,
and sent out a blind email.

18:53.101 --> 18:54.870
I had no idea this was
gonna blow up, none.

18:54.871 --> 18:57.870
- Bahadur, you got
a book outline?

18:57.871 --> 18:59.610
- No! That's what I'm trying
to tell you...

18:59.611 --> 19:06.051
- Stop! Try again.
- You got a book outline?

19:06.052 --> 19:07.851
- I'm formulating it.

19:07.852 --> 19:09.951
- I knew you'd get it
on the third try.

19:09.952 --> 19:11.720
Come on, let's go.

19:11.721 --> 19:16.790
So how much do you know
about Somalia?

19:16.791 --> 19:18.830
- Uh, well, I did a term paper

19:18.831 --> 19:20.860
on it my freshman year
at university, so.

19:20.861 --> 19:22.260
- That's good.

19:22.261 --> 19:26.000
Don't tell me the grade.
It's a start.

19:26.001 --> 19:27.900
Immerse yourself in it.

19:27.901 --> 19:29.339
You dig cigars?

19:29.340 --> 19:32.010
- I never understood cigars.

19:32.011 --> 19:34.071
- That's clever,
don't you think, Jo?

19:34.081 --> 19:37.310
Okay. Save this.

19:37.311 --> 19:41.280
By the time this thing
is over, you will.

19:41.281 --> 19:44.881
Jo, thank you.

19:44.891 --> 19:48.789
What else don't you understand?
I need to know that.

19:48.790 --> 19:51.689
- The Jays are going to lose
Burnett to the Yanks.

19:51.690 --> 19:54.229
They offered him 82.5 million
over five years.

19:54.230 --> 19:57.730
- Can you believe that?
- I have an announcement.

19:57.731 --> 20:02.170
- What kind of announcement?
- Yes, what kind?

20:02.171 --> 20:07.170
- Uh, I'm gonna go to Somalia

20:07.180 --> 20:10.209
and write a book on the pirates,

20:10.210 --> 20:12.409
try to get
some stories published.

20:12.410 --> 20:17.080
- Somalia?
- I know what you're thinking.

20:17.090 --> 20:21.020
I know you're thinking
it's batshit crazy, but I think

20:21.021 --> 20:25.059
this is the only way
for me to become a journalist.

20:25.060 --> 20:28.029
- AIDS.
- AIDS?

20:28.030 --> 20:31.160
- Isn't that a problem there?
- I believe so,

20:31.170 --> 20:33.999
but I'm going to write
about the pirates,

20:34.000 --> 20:36.440
Dad, not sleep with them.

20:42.080 --> 20:46.849
Excuse me,
it's my Somali contact.

20:46.850 --> 20:52.320
Assalamu alaikum.

20:52.321 --> 20:55.719
Shifted?

20:55.720 --> 20:59.890
- He needs to do more yoga.
- His shoulders are bad.

20:59.900 --> 21:02.259
- Assalam... ciao.

21:09.739 --> 21:15.109
- You okay, sweetheart?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

21:15.110 --> 21:16.309
I was wrong though.

21:16.310 --> 21:18.079
- Wrong?
- Yeah, apparently

21:18.080 --> 21:20.210
there's an additional
$500 security deposit

21:20.220 --> 21:21.478
I didn't account for.

21:21.479 --> 21:25.018
- 500?
- Security deposit?

21:25.019 --> 21:27.419
- Yeah, just for, you know...
- You know, for, like, uh,

21:27.420 --> 21:31.259
vehicles and such, insurance
policies, things like that.

21:34.829 --> 21:37.000
Can I borrow $500?

21:41.239 --> 21:44.338
- Welcome about flight 823 now
departing for Frankfurt.

21:44.339 --> 21:46.108
At this time
we'd like you to put away

21:46.109 --> 21:47.208
- all your electronic devices...
- Excuse me, sir.

21:47.209 --> 21:48.978
All cell phones must be off.

21:48.979 --> 21:50.378
- It's just final words
to my ex-girlfriend

21:50.379 --> 21:52.448
before I had to Somalia.

21:52.449 --> 21:56.879
I'm, uh, basically looking for
a little sympathy, maybe a wow.

21:56.889 --> 22:01.758
Personally, between me and you,
I'd settle for an LOL.

22:01.759 --> 22:03.920
- Off, please.
- Right, right, sorry.

22:03.930 --> 22:05.758
I want to take
a moment now to say

22:05.759 --> 22:07.289
that not all the characters
in this film

22:07.299 --> 22:08.758
are exactly like
they are in real life,

22:08.759 --> 22:11.059
except for that stewardess.

22:11.069 --> 22:13.529
I felt she needed to be
depicted completely accurately

22:13.539 --> 22:16.537
in her total lack
of empathy for my pain.

22:16.538 --> 22:18.537
Thankfully I only had to spend
the next eight hours

22:18.538 --> 22:20.207
of my journey with her,

22:20.208 --> 22:22.137
and then I'd get
a new stewardess,

22:22.138 --> 22:24.307
and then another stewardess,
and then another.

22:24.308 --> 22:26.108
In fact, I might have set

22:26.109 --> 22:28.009
a connecting
flight record to Somalia,

22:28.019 --> 22:30.448
but see, this was all part
of my master plan,

22:30.449 --> 22:33.188
a fixed budget that would
allow me to write my book,

22:33.189 --> 22:34.888
and unlike several
of my predecessors

22:34.889 --> 22:36.887
who ventured to
where that flag is,

22:36.888 --> 22:39.989
I'd say alive, as kidnapping
and killing journalists

22:39.999 --> 22:41.438
had become an
unfortunate trend here.

23:16.998 --> 23:18.128
Dude.

23:26.468 --> 23:29.477
Fuck! Stop!

23:29.478 --> 23:33.307
Stop the fucking... Seymour?

23:33.317 --> 23:35.316
Tracy?

23:35.317 --> 23:37.047
I thought you were
repulsed by older men!

23:41.988 --> 23:43.387
- Please calm down!
- Make out with me!

23:43.388 --> 23:48.157
Make out with me now!
Ahh!

23:48.158 --> 23:50.026
Believe it or not,
that is what I consider

23:50.027 --> 23:51.427
a mild Tracy nightmare.

23:51.428 --> 23:55.166
Sorry, sorry, man.

23:55.167 --> 23:57.097
In order to
clear my mind of its negativity,

23:57.107 --> 23:59.406
I'll take a moment now to focus
on the less fortunate

23:59.407 --> 24:04.037
than myself,
the people of Somalia.

24:04.047 --> 24:07.547
Hard to believe this land was
once known as a nation of poets.

24:07.548 --> 24:10.046
Throughout their history,
the Somali poet was counted on

24:10.047 --> 24:12.116
to defend a clan's honor.

24:12.117 --> 24:13.916
They used poems of persuasion

24:13.917 --> 24:16.586
in lieu of weapons
to settle disputes,

24:16.587 --> 24:19.887
but in the 20th century
times changed.

24:19.897 --> 24:21.256
Both the English
and the Italians

24:21.257 --> 24:23.557
attempted to colonize them.

24:23.567 --> 24:25.566
They introduced guns
into battle,

24:25.567 --> 24:28.665
and although Somalia
valiantly refused to succumb,

24:28.666 --> 24:32.306
the scars of war never relented.

24:32.307 --> 24:35.306
Somalia's recent civil war
had caused over a million people

24:35.307 --> 24:38.476
to flee to neighboring
countries as refuges.

24:38.477 --> 24:42.676
Those who stayed faced droughts,
floods, famine,

24:42.677 --> 24:45.685
feuding clan battles, and jihad.

24:45.686 --> 24:48.915
Their newly-elected President
Farole had his hands full,

24:48.916 --> 24:52.525
especially when you threw
in the pirates.

24:52.526 --> 24:55.126
I arrived at my destination
city of Galkayo,

24:55.127 --> 24:57.526
and into the fire I plunged,

24:57.527 --> 25:02.168
or as my Somali translation
book said, "Dabka."

25:10.006 --> 25:13.206
Holy fuck.

25:15.046 --> 25:17.145
- Mr. Bahadur? Mr. Bahadur.
- Hi.

25:17.146 --> 25:19.216
- Hi, welcome to Galkayo.
- Oh, thank you.

25:19.217 --> 25:22.285
- Yes. I am Abdirizak.
- You call me Abdi.

25:22.286 --> 25:23.685
I am your translator.

25:23.686 --> 25:25.055
- Cool. Good to meet you.

25:25.056 --> 25:26.455
- Good to meet you, yes.

25:26.456 --> 25:29.995
- How was your flight?
- It was good.

25:29.996 --> 25:33.595
- That's good. Oh, please don't
do the... with your finger here.

25:33.596 --> 25:35.195
- This?
- Yes. Oh, please...

25:35.196 --> 25:37.035
- Oh, no, I'm sorry.
- I didn't know.

25:37.036 --> 25:38.466
I'm... I'm so sorry. I...

25:38.467 --> 25:40.235
- It's offensive.

25:40.236 --> 25:41.404
- I'll keep the thumbs in
check. Thank you.

25:41.405 --> 25:43.134
- Yes, yes.
- Yeah.

25:43.135 --> 25:45.375
- Your English is great.
- It's not perfect.

25:45.376 --> 25:49.115
I try to learn from you
during your stay, Mr. Bahadur.

25:49.116 --> 25:51.476
- Oh, please call me Jay.
- Jay?

25:51.486 --> 25:53.045
- Yeah, Jay.

25:53.046 --> 25:55.355
- Jay, you have one bag?
- Yeah, one bag.

25:55.356 --> 25:58.285
- Oh, you're like Obama,
a man that knows what he wants.

25:58.286 --> 26:00.085
- You know Obama?

26:00.095 --> 26:01.724
- Of course. He will be great
leader for your people.

26:01.725 --> 26:04.294
- Oh, I'm Canadian.
- He's... he's not my leader.

26:04.295 --> 26:05.724
- Of course he is.

26:05.725 --> 26:08.465
Your people just don't know it.
Come.

26:11.666 --> 26:15.636
♪

26:17.705 --> 26:25.015
♪

26:28.055 --> 26:31.284
So I hear you are
an author and journalist.

26:31.285 --> 26:35.125
- Yes.
- Good, good.

26:35.126 --> 26:38.124
There is so much to write
about in this country.

26:38.125 --> 26:39.594
What is your subject?

26:39.595 --> 26:41.094
- In a perfect world
I'd be writing

26:41.095 --> 26:43.034
about your newfound democracy,

26:43.035 --> 26:44.795
but, um, given the fact

26:44.805 --> 26:48.665
that the West has broken off
all relations with you, um,

26:48.675 --> 26:50.735
I'm here to write
about your pirates.

26:50.745 --> 26:55.073
- You mean badaadinta badah?
- Bada-binda-bada? What is that?

26:55.074 --> 26:58.543
- It means saviors of the sea.
- They are like Coast Guard.

26:58.544 --> 27:00.745
You can never call them pirates.

27:00.755 --> 27:02.714
- Okay. That's good to know.

27:02.715 --> 27:07.524
- They have very strong opinion
on this, never pirates.

27:07.525 --> 27:10.355
- Are they easy to find?
- Yes, of course.

27:10.365 --> 27:13.524
They are people
with crazy money.

27:13.534 --> 27:15.063
- So they walk freely?

27:15.064 --> 27:17.663
- Yes, but our new
President Farole

27:17.664 --> 27:19.603
has promised to change this.

27:19.604 --> 27:22.633
He is a very tough man
who will bring much change.

27:22.634 --> 27:26.276
Ah!

27:31.085 --> 27:33.243
- Is everything okay?
- Yes, yes.

27:33.244 --> 27:35.714
It's okay?

27:37.454 --> 27:39.253
- Yes, yes.

27:39.254 --> 27:41.853
Sometimes I feel like father
with little children.

27:41.854 --> 27:43.654
They need khat.

27:43.664 --> 27:46.464
- Khat.
- Yes. We must stop up here.

27:54.774 --> 27:56.503
- In Somalia one hour
and already shooting

27:56.504 --> 27:58.734
my first drug deal,

27:58.744 --> 28:02.313
my kind of country.

28:02.314 --> 28:05.513
So khat is a drug?

28:05.514 --> 28:09.752
- Yes, it's... it's a stimulant
leaf from Kenya and Ethiopia.

28:09.753 --> 28:15.123
It's very addictive,
big problem here.

28:15.124 --> 28:19.823
What's he saying?

28:19.824 --> 28:22.663
- He wants to know
if you want to buy some.

28:22.664 --> 28:25.503
- Oh, no, I... I... sorry,

28:25.504 --> 28:27.433
I'm on a very fixed budget.

28:27.434 --> 28:29.473
I didn't account for drug
money. I don't have any...

28:41.554 --> 28:43.753
He wants you to try it.

28:43.754 --> 28:47.622
- It won't kill you.
- Yes, just bite down.

28:47.623 --> 28:49.722
- What's the effects?

28:49.723 --> 28:51.922
- Makes some people
want to have sex,

28:51.923 --> 28:55.323
others very talkative.

28:58.603 --> 29:00.302
- Ugh! Tracy was a great girl,

29:00.303 --> 29:01.463
but, you know, she... what... what
are you gonna do?

29:01.473 --> 29:02.872
She moves on. I move on.

29:02.873 --> 29:04.672
I really doubt we'll ever
even talk again.

29:04.673 --> 29:06.402
I mean, why bother, right?
Seems like a waste of time.

29:06.403 --> 29:07.772
I mean, it's just gonna
confuse thing and make it

29:07.773 --> 29:09.212
- more difficult.
- Men and women

29:09.213 --> 29:10.942
- can't be friends.
- Exactly!

29:10.943 --> 29:12.443
Exactly, that's
the same over here?

29:12.444 --> 29:14.882
- Yes, it's a universal thought.

29:14.883 --> 29:16.782
- See, where I come
from, they debate it.

29:16.783 --> 29:18.952
They debate it like
morons, like idiots.

29:18.953 --> 29:22.822
- It's not a debate. It's fact.
- We're reaching a checkpoint.

29:22.823 --> 29:24.792
Please stay calm.

29:51.282 --> 29:54.322
- Ah, Mr. Bahadur..

29:54.323 --> 29:55.792
- Hi.
- So we finally meet

29:55.793 --> 29:57.722
- face to face, huh?
- Yes, nice to meet you.

29:57.723 --> 30:01.361
- Nice to meet you, sir. Abdi.

30:01.362 --> 30:03.961
You are younger than
I pictured, somewhat.

30:03.962 --> 30:05.961
- Ah.
- Western reporters to me

30:05.962 --> 30:09.471
are always so fucking unhappy.

30:09.472 --> 30:13.501
- Well, I get even better
once I shower.

30:13.502 --> 30:15.771
- Come on, come on.
- Has Abdi been good to you?

30:15.772 --> 30:17.672
- Yes, mad good, yeah.

30:17.682 --> 30:20.281
- He's the best translator
in all of Puntland, you know?

30:20.282 --> 30:21.681
- Oh, no, really?
- Yeah.

30:21.682 --> 30:23.351
We stole him from the pirates.

30:23.352 --> 30:26.521
- Oh, you mean, uh,
badaadinta badah?

30:26.522 --> 30:27.821
- Abdi, did you teach him this?

30:27.822 --> 30:29.451
- Ah...
- This is not

30:29.452 --> 30:31.491
our Coast Guard, Abdi,
they are pirates!

30:31.492 --> 30:34.591
You must forget
the old guard's thinking.

30:34.592 --> 30:36.291
They are pirates!

30:36.292 --> 30:40.461
- Pirates.

30:40.471 --> 30:42.030
- Mr. Jay.
- Hi.

30:42.031 --> 30:44.701
- So what do you think of
the Radio Garowe newsroom?

30:44.702 --> 30:46.401
- Nice.

30:46.402 --> 30:48.841
- Does it look like
the ones in Canada?

30:48.842 --> 30:50.272
- Yes.

30:50.282 --> 30:51.672
Yes, it does, a bit, yeah.

30:51.682 --> 30:53.411
- It's amazing, huh?

30:53.412 --> 30:55.311
- Is it a local station or, um...
- Oh, one minute.

30:55.312 --> 30:57.811
- Okay. Okay.
- Yeah, mostly it's local,

30:57.821 --> 30:59.550
but, you know,
the guy is very famous.

30:59.551 --> 31:01.581
- He used to work for...
- This guy, famous?

31:04.361 --> 31:06.890
That was my father's office.
He wants to meet us now.

31:06.891 --> 31:08.661
- Your father?
- The... the president?

31:08.662 --> 31:11.892
- Yeah, we must go now.

31:11.902 --> 31:13.901
- Fuck.

31:13.902 --> 31:17.570
- Pirates are not the most
cooperative group to deal with.

31:17.571 --> 31:21.501
- Mm-hmm.
- Look here.

31:21.511 --> 31:24.971
The main pirates' clan
are dotted around here.

31:24.981 --> 31:27.580
- Eyl.
- You know Eyl?

31:27.581 --> 31:29.380
- Yeah, that's where
they took the Farhina

31:29.381 --> 31:31.050
and held it for six months.

31:31.051 --> 31:34.420
- Precisely. Eyl is a fishing
town where they started.

31:34.421 --> 31:37.851
I'm working on getting you
a meeting with Boyah.

31:37.861 --> 31:40.760
- Boyah?
- Yes, he's a man Somali

31:40.761 --> 31:42.760
calls Robin Hood.

31:42.761 --> 31:48.861
- Robin Hood of the pirates?
- But it could take some time.

31:48.871 --> 31:54.669
- How much time?
- Days, maybe weeks.

31:54.670 --> 31:56.909
Is that a problem?

31:56.910 --> 31:58.610
- No. No, no, that's fine.
- No?

31:58.611 --> 32:00.010
- That's totally fine, yeah.
- Yeah?

32:00.011 --> 32:01.710
- Yeah.
- Okay.

32:01.711 --> 32:03.080
- Yeah, I'll just... I'll call
my publisher

32:03.081 --> 32:06.650
and make sure it's all set,

32:06.651 --> 32:08.521
finances,
extending it, and everything.

32:27.541 --> 32:30.939
- My father just got in here
a couple weeks ago.

32:30.940 --> 32:35.140
The transition of government
was entirely peaceful.

32:50.790 --> 32:52.999
This is the reporter,
Jay Bahadur.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.060
- It's an honor to meet you,
Your Excellency.

32:55.070 --> 32:56.899
- Welcome, Mr. Bahadur.

32:56.900 --> 33:00.439
So my son tells me you're
the next Mr. Bob Woodward.

33:00.440 --> 33:03.169
- I'm not so sure about that.
- Why aren't you sure?

33:03.170 --> 33:04.839
You have made it farther
into Somalia

33:04.840 --> 33:06.908
than any of
your Western counterparts.

33:06.909 --> 33:10.509
- With all due respect, uh,
I've always considered myself

33:10.519 --> 33:12.819
more of a Bernstein
than a Woodward.

33:12.820 --> 33:15.149
Bernstein was ugly as hell
and never got through college.

33:15.150 --> 33:18.989
Overcame his shortcomings.
Uh, I find that admirable.

33:18.990 --> 33:22.189
- He's a funny guy.
- Very funny.

33:22.190 --> 33:24.191
- I would like to introduce you
to Colonel Omar,

33:24.201 --> 33:29.998
who'll be the head of your
security team during your stay.

33:29.999 --> 33:32.938
- Welcome.
- Pleasure to meet you, Colonel.

33:32.939 --> 33:34.538
- I'll protect you well,
Mr. Bahadur.

33:34.539 --> 33:38.709
You're welcome.

33:38.710 --> 33:44.148
- You have learned some Somali?
- Enough to be a bad tourist.

33:44.149 --> 33:46.878
Um, is this okay?

33:46.879 --> 33:48.918
- Of course.
- That's why you're here.

33:48.919 --> 33:52.458
My family and I spent our last
eight years in Australia...

33:52.459 --> 33:55.658
- Is there a reason the six
pack paisley napk... are...

33:55.659 --> 33:57.558
- And we...
- Not here?

33:57.559 --> 33:59.959
Sorry. I'm so sorry,
Your Excellency. I'm just, uh...

33:59.960 --> 34:01.727
I think because
it was just...

34:01.728 --> 34:03.168
Trying to get this dang
thing working here.

34:03.169 --> 34:07.069
Festive... festive...

34:10.239 --> 34:12.808
Good to go.

34:12.809 --> 34:16.648
- The people of Somalia asked me
to come back here

34:16.649 --> 34:19.777
and to run for this office.

34:19.779 --> 34:23.717
I never saw myself
being the president.

34:23.717 --> 34:25.217
I am a businessman.

34:25.217 --> 34:27.719
I am not a warrior
like my predecessors,

34:27.728 --> 34:30.257
but here I am,
fighting to bring justice

34:30.259 --> 34:33.859
to those who destroy
our country.

34:33.869 --> 34:37.768
Have you seen a school since
you've come here, Mr. Bahadur?

34:37.768 --> 34:39.937
- Uh, no, I must
admit I haven't.

34:39.938 --> 34:43.067
- We have the fewest schools
in the African nations.

34:43.068 --> 34:48.777
Do you know how hard it is
to rule here with a PhD

34:48.777 --> 34:54.079
knowing the children I lead
have no chance for an education?

34:54.089 --> 34:58.117
Their role models
of success are pirates.

34:58.118 --> 35:01.957
The Western world thinks
we encourage this.

35:01.958 --> 35:06.627
This must change.

35:06.628 --> 35:09.297
Do you have a title yet?

35:09.298 --> 35:10.929
- A title?

35:10.939 --> 35:13.167
- For your future
bestselling book.

35:13.168 --> 35:16.906
- Oh. Um, yes, of course.

35:16.907 --> 35:21.807
Um, "Pirates."

35:21.808 --> 35:23.747
- That's shit title.

35:23.748 --> 35:26.247
Just "Pirates?"

35:26.248 --> 35:31.948
- "Pirates of Somalia."
- Be more creative.

35:31.958 --> 35:33.117
- Be more creative.
- Creative?

35:33.118 --> 35:34.817
- Yeah.
- Creative.

35:34.827 --> 35:40.757
- Creative
- Yes, creative, you're right.

35:40.767 --> 35:43.567
- Jay, you know,
my father likes you.

35:43.568 --> 35:46.168
- What, you think so?
- Yes, yes.

35:46.169 --> 35:47.798
- All right.

35:47.808 --> 35:51.637
- He knows you will bring
great things here.

35:51.638 --> 35:55.606
- What if I don't?

35:55.607 --> 35:58.876
- How can you not when people
read your bestseller?

35:58.877 --> 36:00.777
- Ohh.

36:00.787 --> 36:03.616
- Abdi, have you
found Boyah yet?

36:03.617 --> 36:06.356
- Mm.
- Oh, you must be patient, man.

36:06.357 --> 36:08.358

something in the pages,

51:06.005 --> 51:08.044
you could help me
get a book deal.

51:08.045 --> 51:10.244
Will... will you read my pages?

51:10.245 --> 51:12.175
- Yes.

Nice! Nice, buddy. Yes!

53:41.264 --> 53:45.962
- Yes, I see you in the window.
- You speak English.

53:45.963 --> 53:49.762
- A little.
- Where did you learn?

53:49.772 --> 53:52.901
- I watch a lot
of American movies.

53:52.902 --> 53:54.701
- Movies?

53:54.702 --> 53:59.112
- Yeah. I love.
- That makes two of us.

53:59.113 --> 54:00.742
- Yes?
- Yeah.

54:00.743 --> 54:02.912
Uh, got movie posters

- Yeah. I like Demi Moore.
- She's a very tough woman.

54:12.692 --> 54:14.862
- Yeah, especially
with that buzz cut.

54:14.863 --> 54:16.762
It's super butch.

54:16.763 --> 54:18.892
I'm sure Demi Moore
would be honored, though,

54:18.902 --> 54:21.801
to have a Somali fan club.

54:21.802 --> 54:26.832
- The movie I think is
very wrong is "Black Hawk Down."

54:26.842 --> 54:29.941
- Because, uh, it's about
what went down in Mogadishu?

54:29.942 --> 54:34.111
- No, because it's about
our people,

54:34.112 --> 54:39.251
and they do not use a single
person from Somalia in it.

54:39.252 --> 54:41.982
It is wrong.

54:41.992 --> 54:46.151
- I didn't know that.
- Yes.

54:46.161 --> 54:49.222
"Derka derka Mohammed jihad,"

54:49.232 --> 54:53.731
That's what they were doing
the whole pathetic film.

54:53.732 --> 54:56.962
- You just did "Team America."
That's crazy. Wow.

54:56.972 --> 55:00.901
- Yes, "Team America"
said many smart things.

55:00.902 --> 55:04.010
- This conversation
is getting surreal.

55:04.011 --> 55:06.940

talks about you?

55:06.941 --> 55:09.280

- Yeah.

55:09.281 --> 55:11.310

55:18.392 --> 55:19.791

55:22.961 --> 55:27.931
but, uh,
what do you think about them?

55:27.932 --> 55:30.500
- I'm not the person to ask.

55:30.501 --> 55:33.000
I'm married to one.

55:33.001 --> 55:35.840
- Garaad.
- So you know?

55:35.841 --> 55:38.441
- I know, yeah.
- He's a very powerful man.

55:38.442 --> 55:40.141
I'm trying to meet him.

55:40.142 --> 55:44.310
- Yeah, you and I
both want that meeting.

55:44.311 --> 55:47.080
- You don't see him much?

55:47.081 --> 55:50.381
- Not since I married him, no.

55:50.391 --> 55:52.190
- Well, you'd be
a better treasure

55:52.191 --> 55:54.790
than anything he'd find
on one of those ships.

55:54.791 --> 55:57.760

foreign money, right?

Okay. Uh, how much

piece of advice,

Like, I really... I really trust
you because, you know,

01:01:56.446 --> 01:01:57.845
I don't really have

01:02:47.196 --> 01:02:51.434
you are the only reporter

I'm not a reporter, okay?

01:03:03.885 --> 01:03:05.484
I thought I could come here

01:03:05.485 --> 01:03:08.454
and get a book deal
or publish some stuff

01:03:08.455 --> 01:03:11.385
once I sent some pages
to editors,

01:03:11.386 --> 01:03:13.186

01:03:13.196 --> 01:03:14.454

I'm fucking dead.

01:03:24.265 --> 01:03:25.933
I'm dead. He's gonna kill me.

01:03:25.934 --> 01:03:29.434
- Perhaps yes, perhaps no.
- He understands rejection.

01:03:29.444 --> 01:03:30.834
It's a human trait.

01:03:30.844 --> 01:03:33.644
- I shouldn't have
come here, man.

01:03:33.645 --> 01:03:35.744
I'm a fucking idiot.

01:03:35.745 --> 01:03:38.244
- Don't say that, Jay.
- Don't say that.

01:03:38.245 --> 01:03:40.445
- You had no choice.
- Yeah.

01:03:40.455 --> 01:03:41.954
I came here with the noble idea

01:03:41.955 --> 01:03:43.583
of exposing the truth,

01:03:43.584 --> 01:03:48.694
and I lied
to everyone around me.

01:03:48.695 --> 01:03:50.934
- You wake me in the middle
of the night to tell me this?

01:03:54.734 --> 01:03:58.634
- I came here
to ask you a favor.

01:03:58.635 --> 01:04:01.833
- Ask me.
- Yeah, okay.

01:04:01.834 --> 01:04:08.413
I need you to help me get on
a ship and film some hostages.

01:04:08.414 --> 01:04:10.874
- Jay, that is not wise.
- I know it's not wise.

01:04:10.884 --> 01:04:14.913
I know that, but, you know, this
is the only way that people out

01:04:14.914 --> 01:04:19.423
there are gonna give a fuck
about what is going on here.

01:04:19.424 --> 01:04:20.652
It's the only way.

01:04:20.653 --> 01:04:22.394
- I don't believe that.

01:04:22.395 --> 01:04:24.264
- Dude, CBS is willing
to pay $1,000, okay?

01:04:24.265 --> 01:04:25.993
I'll split it with you
if you can get me on a ship.

01:04:25.994 --> 01:04:28.933
I'll split it with you.
That's $500, American dollars.

01:04:28.934 --> 01:04:31.003
That's fucking great money, man.

01:04:31.004 --> 01:04:34.573
- Jay, it's not about money.

01:04:34.574 --> 01:04:37.503
Once you're on the ship,
we cannot protect you.

01:04:39.543 --> 01:04:41.972
- It's CBS.
- It's the biggest network.

01:04:41.973 --> 01:04:43.573
- Yes, and your being

01:04:43.583 --> 01:04:45.843
a famous reporter
getting killed,

01:04:45.853 --> 01:04:48.713
that would seal the fate
for Somali people as terrorists.

01:04:48.714 --> 01:04:51.283
- And I'm not famous.
- Jay, you will be.

01:04:51.284 --> 01:04:53.584
- Abdi, they're not
publishing my words,

01:04:53.594 --> 01:04:55.523
not a single fucking one!

01:04:55.524 --> 01:04:57.792
Nobody gives a flying
fuck about Boyah,

01:04:57.793 --> 01:05:00.393
the struggling fisherman
turned Robin Hood pirate!

01:05:00.394 --> 01:05:02.062
They don't fucking care, man!

01:05:02.063 --> 01:05:05.062
- Do you know Somali clans
used to fight with words

01:05:05.063 --> 01:05:06.802
rather than weapons?

01:05:06.803 --> 01:05:08.432
- I knew that, yes.
- I did a paper on that.

01:05:08.433 --> 01:05:11.843
- So you know our
great freedom fighter,

01:05:11.844 --> 01:05:14.543
the poet warrior Mohammed
Abdullah Hassan, Sayyidka?

01:05:14.544 --> 01:05:16.042
- The English called him
Mad Mullah.

01:05:16.043 --> 01:05:18.082
- Ah, you know of him.

01:05:18.083 --> 01:05:20.982
- Yes, I do, and I also know
that iambic pentameter

01:05:20.983 --> 01:05:23.552
is not gonna solve
this problem, man.

01:05:23.553 --> 01:05:25.852
I got to get on a fucking ship.

01:05:25.853 --> 01:05:27.622
- I will do something better.
- Better?

01:05:27.623 --> 01:05:29.592
What the fuck... what's
better than that?

01:05:29.593 --> 01:05:34.592
- I was working to get you
in a meeting with the Garaad.

01:05:34.593 --> 01:05:35.933
- The Garaad?
- Yes.

01:05:35.934 --> 01:05:37.902
- The godfather of pirates?

01:05:37.903 --> 01:05:41.672
- The man you want to have
crazy sex with his wife.

01:05:41.673 --> 01:05:43.533
- What makes you say that?

01:05:43.543 --> 01:05:46.603
- You don't think all
of Garowe know this?

01:05:46.613 --> 01:05:48.042
- Does Garaad?

01:05:48.043 --> 01:05:50.712
- If he know,
you wouldn't be here.

01:05:50.713 --> 01:05:51.912
- That's comforting.

01:05:51.913 --> 01:05:54.081
- He wants me as a translator,

01:05:54.082 --> 01:05:57.412
so perhaps I trade
for the possibility of him

01:05:57.422 --> 01:05:58.851
and you in a room.

01:05:58.852 --> 01:06:00.082
- Then you're putting
yourself in danger.

01:06:00.092 --> 01:06:01.492
That's... I don't like that.

01:06:01.493 --> 01:06:04.492
- No, no, no, no, mm-mm.

01:06:04.493 --> 01:06:07.662
That's nonsense, Jay.

01:06:07.663 --> 01:06:08.892
- Why you helping me like this?

01:06:08.893 --> 01:06:10.563
Why you doing that?

01:06:10.564 --> 01:06:13.362
- You are my bro.

01:06:13.372 --> 01:06:15.401
I have to help you.

01:06:15.402 --> 01:06:16.501
- Thanks, man.
- Okay?

01:06:16.502 --> 01:06:18.141
- Thank you.

01:06:18.142 --> 01:06:20.941
- You're my bro, Jay.
- Whew, yeah.

01:06:20.942 --> 01:06:24.011
- Don't worry, okay?
- Okay. We're good.

01:06:24.012 --> 01:06:27.643
- Okay. Mm-hmm.
- Have a good night.

01:06:27.653 --> 01:06:31.821
- Edgar Allen Poe, Oscar Wilde,
Herman Melville, H.P. Lovecraft

01:06:31.822 --> 01:06:34.391
all had one thing in common.

01:06:34.392 --> 01:06:38.461
They died broke,
completely penniless,

01:06:38.462 --> 01:06:40.561
so I got to blame
President Farole

01:06:40.562 --> 01:06:43.061
a little bit for not asking
for all his money up front.

01:06:43.062 --> 01:06:45.431
After all, I am a writer,
not an accountant, right?

01:06:45.432 --> 01:06:46.832
Rule number one in life, Asad,

01:06:46.833 --> 01:06:49.631
don't blow all
your money on drugs,

01:06:49.641 --> 01:06:52.902
unless it's definitely gonna
lead to some serious ass

01:06:52.912 --> 01:06:55.741
or a Pulitzer Prize.

01:06:55.742 --> 01:06:59.112
This might not lead to either,
but I'd rather die trying.

01:07:06.792 --> 01:07:09.051

could maybe elaborate on that.

and everyone that's
doing illegal fishing.

01:12:40.418 --> 01:12:44.187
- Is it fair to say
that any ship

01:12:44.188 --> 01:12:45.987

01:12:45.988 --> 01:12:50.087
be it fishing, cargo,

01:12:50.097 --> 01:12:56.467
yacht, that ship is fair game
for your organization to take?

who they are.

01:13:12.517 --> 01:13:14.316
- They are doing
something wrong.

01:13:14.317 --> 01:13:19.016

The pirate in charge
is a friend of Colonel Omar.

01:13:52.886 --> 01:13:53.886
- Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:13:53.887 --> 01:13:55.886

01:13:55.887 --> 01:13:58.226
- You can get me on a ship?
- You want to be on the ship?

01:13:58.227 --> 01:13:59.925
- Yeah.
- Because I had to fight

01:13:59.926 --> 01:14:01.256

01:14:01.266 --> 01:14:03.226
on this idea for you.

01:14:03.236 --> 01:14:04.995
- Dude, I thought you were
against me getting on a ship.

01:14:04.996 --> 01:14:08.205
- I am.
- Farole tell me to collect $500

01:14:08.206 --> 01:14:10.035
from you for costs
before you leave.

01:14:10.036 --> 01:14:11.435

I didn't want to put you
in that spot, but...

01:14:21.246 --> 01:14:23.546
- Yeah, you spent it
on pirate drugs.

01:14:23.556 --> 01:14:25.355
- Yeah, the pirates don't,

01:14:25.356 --> 01:14:27.485
you know, give an interview
without the drug.

01:14:27.486 --> 01:14:29.986

01:28:20.974 --> 01:28:23.013
throughout the country
reacted angrily,

01:28:23.014 --> 01:28:25.243
saying they will capture
and kill any foreigners

01:28:25.244 --> 01:28:29.113
they find to avenge
their comrades' death.

01:28:29.114 --> 01:28:33.153
- At this time no one is
taking credit for the operation.

01:28:33.154 --> 01:28:37.293
We will get answers soon because
my father is demanding it.

01:28:37.294 --> 01:28:41.463
- Mr. Farole, three pirates have
been killed by the Americans.

01:28:41.464 --> 01:28:43.133
There is going to be revenge,

01:28:43.134 --> 01:28:44.463
and it's too dangerous
for Mr. Bahadur

01:28:44.464 --> 01:28:46.202
to remain here in Garowe.

01:28:46.203 --> 01:28:48.332
- No, it's not.
- I will keep a low profile.

01:28:48.333 --> 01:28:49.903
- Just like you did in Eyl?

01:28:49.904 --> 01:28:51.204
- Eyl was a mistake, okay?

01:28:51.205 --> 01:28:52.874
- You keep saying
it was a mistake.

01:28:52.875 --> 01:28:54.743
- I messed up.
- I'm sorry about that.

01:28:54.744 --> 01:28:56.273
- It was a mistake.
- I was a little high strung.

01:28:56.274 --> 01:28:58.243
- Don't be telling this.
- You're staying here...

01:28:58.244 --> 01:28:59.413
- Okay, I have learned from it,
and I'm all good now.

01:28:59.414 --> 01:29:01.083
I'm not gonna do that again.

01:29:01.084 --> 01:29:02.453
- Mr. Bahadur, I agree
with the Colonel, okay?

01:29:02.454 --> 01:29:05.013
I think we have to
get you out of here.

01:29:05.023 --> 01:29:08.452
We do not need any harm coming
to you. Do you understand that?

01:29:08.453 --> 01:29:10.152

for my safety,

01:29:17.804 --> 01:29:19.263
but you need somebody here.

01:29:19.264 --> 01:29:21.403
I need to find out
who's behind this, okay?

01:29:21.404 --> 01:29:23.133

01:29:23.134 --> 01:29:24.803
- No, no, Mr....
- So I can interview them.

01:29:24.804 --> 01:29:26.473

- Madness.

- Khat's eating his brain.
- Khat?

01:29:33.513 --> 01:29:35.343
- Khat is not eating
my fucking brain.

01:29:35.353 --> 01:29:37.152
- It is. I can hear that.
- There's no one else here

01:29:37.153 --> 01:29:39.122
- from the Western media.
- Mr. Bahadur, calm down!

01:29:39.123 --> 01:29:41.084
- Your father needs
somebody on his side!

01:29:41.094 --> 01:29:42.992

- He needs somebody on his side!

01:29:42.993 --> 01:29:44.322

a final meeting with Boyah?

01:42:32.083 --> 01:42:34.553
165 were from news services

01:42:34.554 --> 01:42:37.052
offering
to buy my Garaad interview.

01:42:37.053 --> 01:42:40.892
Eight were from publishers
wanting to buy my book rights,

01:42:40.893 --> 01:42:44.892
and four of them
were from Tracy.

01:42:49.302 --> 01:42:50.931
I decided if she really
wanted to know

01:42:50.932 --> 01:42:53.671
what was going on in my life,

01:42:53.672 --> 01:42:56.671
she could read about it.

01:42:56.672 --> 01:42:58.903
- Excuse me.
- Can I see your passport?

01:42:58.913 --> 01:43:01.572
- Passport?

01:43:06.612 --> 01:43:09.683
- Follow me, please.

01:43:19.861 --> 01:43:22.191
- Hello, Mr. Bahadur.
- Hello.

01:43:22.201 --> 01:43:24.662
- My name's Agent Brice.
- I'm with CSIS.

01:43:24.672 --> 01:43:29.301
- Okay. Uh, is... am I in
some sort of trouble?

01:43:29.302 --> 01:43:31.271
- Quite the opposite.

01:43:31.272 --> 01:43:34.011
We're very anxious to learn
if you could give us any insight

01:43:34.012 --> 01:43:38.741
that you may have gained
while in Somalia.

01:43:38.751 --> 01:43:41.680
- Wait, you want me
to give you insight?

01:43:41.681 --> 01:43:44.921
- Look, uh, both the U.S.
- and the Canadian intelligence

01:43:44.922 --> 01:43:49.152
are basically flying blind
in the region,

01:43:49.162 --> 01:43:52.591
so we could use some help.

01:43:52.592 --> 01:43:54.731
- Oh, my God.

01:43:54.732 --> 01:43:58.061
Wow. Okay.

01:43:58.071 --> 01:44:01.600
Uh, this... my parents are, uh,
doing the circling thing.

01:44:01.601 --> 01:44:04.000
- Right, okay. All right,
well, uh, tell you what.

01:44:04.001 --> 01:44:08.211
Why don't you give me a call
when you're settled in?

01:44:12.211 --> 01:44:16.150
- Toronto had stayed perfectly
intact despite my absence.

01:44:16.151 --> 01:44:18.150
I couldn't vouch for
the napkin patterns

01:44:18.151 --> 01:44:21.091
inside each home we drove past,

01:44:21.092 --> 01:44:23.191
but I had to guess
my painstaking research

01:44:23.192 --> 01:44:25.291
did little to alter
the landscape.

01:44:29.961 --> 01:44:31.700
- We don't want to upset you.

01:44:31.701 --> 01:44:33.229
We did not know
how to tell you this.

01:44:33.230 --> 01:44:35.969
- Jared's been living
in the basement.

01:44:35.970 --> 01:44:37.800
- What?

01:44:37.801 --> 01:44:41.040
- Well, you've been gone
for six months, sweetheart.

01:44:41.041 --> 01:44:42.910
So, you know, um, he's sleeping

01:44:42.911 --> 01:44:44.810
because he has exams
in the morning,

01:44:44.811 --> 01:44:46.810
so it's best that you enter
through the front door.

01:44:46.811 --> 01:44:48.380
- Can I still use the shower,

01:44:48.381 --> 01:44:50.420
or are the pipes
gonna wake him too?

01:44:50.421 --> 01:44:55.690
- I think tonight we can
make an exception.

01:44:55.691 --> 01:44:58.360
Fuck Harvard!

01:44:58.361 --> 01:45:02.090
- Oh, my God!

01:45:04.201 --> 01:45:08.300
- Fuck Harvard!

01:45:08.301 --> 01:45:09.930
- I've never heard
you swear before.

01:45:09.940 --> 01:45:11.969
- Yeah, well, it's true.
- Fuck 'em.

01:45:11.970 --> 01:45:14.069
My Jay beat all the odds,

01:45:14.070 --> 01:45:15.409
and you're gonna
win the Pulitzer

01:45:15.410 --> 01:45:18.279
from writing it in our basement.

01:45:18.280 --> 01:45:22.010
- To Jay and his fucking
basement Pulitzer!

01:45:22.020 --> 01:45:23.979
- Yeah!

01:45:23.980 --> 01:45:26.989
- Who's idea
was "Fuck Harvard?"

01:45:26.990 --> 01:45:30.290
- Bahadur, you better tell me
you got laid at least

01:45:30.291 --> 01:45:33.060
once over there, or I'm leaving.

01:45:33.061 --> 01:45:35.890
On second thought,
don't tell me.

01:45:35.900 --> 01:45:37.260
Booze is too good to leave.

01:45:39.030 --> 01:45:43.069
- You guys want to see
something really cool?

01:45:43.070 --> 01:45:45.169
- Wow.

01:45:45.170 --> 01:45:49.708
You should see
what he does with the bottle.

01:45:49.709 --> 01:45:54.079
- Would I like mine
so... hey, man.

01:45:54.080 --> 01:45:55.879
- What are you mumbling about?

01:45:55.880 --> 01:45:58.219
- Well, I'm just thinking
aloud, you know?

01:45:58.220 --> 01:46:01.989
- Okay. I like that.
- I like that.

01:46:01.990 --> 01:46:06.459
- So what's next, Bahadur?
- Next?

01:46:06.460 --> 01:46:10.299
- What's gonna keep you from
spending all your nights

01:46:10.300 --> 01:46:13.468
in the shadow of those guys?

01:46:13.469 --> 01:46:16.998
- Well, I got a ton of work
to do on the book.

01:46:16.999 --> 01:46:19.269
- After the book?
- After?

01:46:19.270 --> 01:46:22.339
- Yeah.

01:46:22.340 --> 01:46:26.178
- Take a look at that.

01:46:26.179 --> 01:46:30.248
- 70-year-old men don't get
handed fucking business cards

01:46:30.249 --> 01:46:33.079
for a reason unless
it's a last rites priest.

01:46:33.089 --> 01:46:34.448
What's it say?

01:46:34.449 --> 01:46:38.858
- Agent T. Brice, CSIS.
- CSIS?

01:46:38.859 --> 01:46:40.788
- Yeah.
- They talked to you?

01:46:40.789 --> 01:46:46.160
- Yes, they did.
- What'd they say?

01:46:46.170 --> 01:46:50.198
- They were anxious to listen
to what I learned over there.

01:46:50.199 --> 01:46:52.099
- Anxious, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

01:46:52.109 --> 01:46:54.268
- Anxious?
- Mm-hmm.

01:46:54.269 --> 01:47:00.248
- Could bring an opportunity.
- That's what I think.

01:47:00.249 --> 01:47:02.447
- Oh.
- Hmm?

01:47:02.448 --> 01:47:05.778
- Christ, you haven't smoked
this fucker yet?

01:47:05.788 --> 01:47:07.418
- Not yet.
- I've been tempted though.

01:47:07.419 --> 01:47:10.419
- You're hopeless.
- Give me the fucking thing.

01:47:14.959 --> 01:47:17.028
- That's Somali?
- Yes.

01:47:17.029 --> 01:47:20.868
- What does it mean?
- "Tonight, we drink."

01:47:20.869 --> 01:47:22.368
- Oh, that's good to hear.

01:47:22.369 --> 01:47:25.237
I thought you were gonna say,
"Tonight we fuck."

01:47:25.238 --> 01:47:32.339
♪

01:47:37.849 --> 01:47:39.347
- Please have a seat.

01:47:39.348 --> 01:47:42.018
- Thank you.

01:47:46.888 --> 01:47:51.558
- State your name and work
position for the committee.

01:47:51.568 --> 01:47:53.259
- Sure.

01:47:53.269 --> 01:47:55.198
My name is Jay Bahadur.

01:47:55.199 --> 01:47:56.529
I'm a Canadian citizen

01:47:56.539 --> 01:47:58.199
currently living
in Nairobi, Kenya.

01:47:58.209 --> 01:47:59.467
I'm running
"The Somalia Report,"

01:47:59.468 --> 01:48:01.367
which is the largest and in fact

01:48:01.368 --> 01:48:04.507
the only English-language
news site devoted to Somalia.

01:48:04.508 --> 01:48:06.338
- Mr. Bahadur, you're
considered

01:48:06.348 --> 01:48:07.907
one of the foremost experts

01:48:07.908 --> 01:48:12.178
on Somali piracy, are you not?

01:48:12.188 --> 01:48:15.216
- I have some knowledge, sir.
- Some knowledge

01:48:15.217 --> 01:48:17.116
would be an understatement.

01:48:17.117 --> 01:48:19.186
Your book on piracy's currently
on "The New York Times'"

01:48:19.187 --> 01:48:21.526
bestseller list, is it not?

01:48:21.527 --> 01:48:24.197
- Yes, that's true, sir.
- In your opinion,

01:48:24.198 --> 01:48:26.058
what's the most
effective way for us

01:48:26.068 --> 01:48:28.929
to combat
this current piracy trend

01:48:28.939 --> 01:48:32.638
and make shipping lanes
safe for our vessels?

01:48:32.639 --> 01:48:36.306
- Well, that's a very
general question, sir.

01:48:36.307 --> 01:48:42.546
- Well, your best answer's
all we ask, sir.

01:48:42.547 --> 01:48:45.146
- Okay.

01:48:45.147 --> 01:48:47.017
I know there's a lot
of collective knowledge

01:48:47.018 --> 01:48:49.148
in this room, so I apologize
if what I'm about to say

01:48:49.158 --> 01:48:51.187
is old news to some of you.

01:48:51.188 --> 01:48:54.156
I did a paper on the subject
my freshman year at university,

01:48:54.157 --> 01:48:55.956
and it just stuck with me.

01:48:55.957 --> 01:48:58.896
- A school paper?

01:48:58.897 --> 01:49:00.626
- Yes.
- Are we gonna hear

01:49:00.627 --> 01:49:03.496
your grade too?

01:49:03.497 --> 01:49:06.907
- No, sir, that is classified.

01:49:06.908 --> 01:49:11.335
Um, in 2002 Somaliland
held an election

01:49:11.336 --> 01:49:15.176
where the minority clan won the
presidential office by 80 votes,

01:49:15.177 --> 01:49:19.177
and the transition of power
was completely peaceful,

01:49:19.187 --> 01:49:22.086
no violence, not one shot fired.

01:49:22.087 --> 01:49:24.056
That doesn't happen
anywhere in Africa.

01:49:24.057 --> 01:49:26.386
That doesn't even happen here.

01:49:26.387 --> 01:49:30.355
Anyway, it caught my eye
and made me start

01:49:30.356 --> 01:49:31.956
to fall in love with Somalia

01:49:31.966 --> 01:49:33.425
and ultimately made me

01:49:33.426 --> 01:49:35.926
go there to find out
what made them different.

01:49:35.936 --> 01:49:37.566
After spending
my last five years

01:49:37.567 --> 01:49:40.507
immersed in their
country's struggles,

01:49:40.508 --> 01:49:44.977
they don't need your
warships off their coast.

01:49:44.978 --> 01:49:48.145
What they need is to be
recognized by all of you

01:49:48.146 --> 01:49:53.515
for the incredibly complex but
honorable culture that they are.

01:49:53.516 --> 01:49:56.215
A fledgling democracy doesn't
make headlines like pirates do.

01:49:56.216 --> 01:49:57.715
You guys wouldn't be
sitting here talking to me

01:49:57.716 --> 01:49:59.655
if I wrote a book
on a fledgling democracy.

01:49:59.656 --> 01:50:01.385
Hell, I couldn't even
afford this suit

01:50:01.386 --> 01:50:05.196
if I wrote a book
on a fledgling democracy.

01:50:05.197 --> 01:50:08.465
All I'm asking is that you guys
start to look at Somalia

01:50:08.466 --> 01:50:10.265
in a different way,

01:50:10.266 --> 01:50:13.235
not so much as them versus us,

01:50:13.236 --> 01:50:17.476
but rather look at Somalia as us

01:50:17.477 --> 01:50:20.307
when we were young.
