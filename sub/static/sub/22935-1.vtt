00:06.057 --> 00:09.226
- There's a time when the
operation of the machine

00:09.227 --> 00:11.466
becomes so odious,

00:11.467 --> 00:14.936
makes you so sick at heart
that you can't take part.

00:14.937 --> 00:17.236
You can't even
passively take part,

00:17.237 --> 00:19.735
and you've got to put
your bodies upon the gears

00:19.736 --> 00:22.136
and upon the wheels,
upon the levers,

00:22.146 --> 00:23.536
upon all the apparatus,

00:23.546 --> 00:25.246
and you've got to make it stop!

00:25.247 --> 00:31.947
â™ª

00:31.957 --> 00:34.586
- First, let me start by
saying Mario Savio's

00:34.587 --> 00:36.486
"Operation of the Machine"

00:36.487 --> 00:39.486
is one of my favorite
speeches of all time.

00:39.496 --> 00:43.495
Mario wasn't a politician
or some famous Hollywood star.

00:43.496 --> 00:46.665
He was just a student
who was for civil rights.

00:46.666 --> 00:48.535
He stood on a car at Berkley

00:48.536 --> 00:50.536
and screamed whatever
came into his head.

00:50.537 --> 00:52.667
He didn't care that he had
a stuttering problem

00:52.677 --> 00:55.537
or that he might get thrown
out of school, which he did.

00:55.547 --> 00:58.775
He just wanted
his voice to be heard

00:58.776 --> 01:03.245
and be unencumbered
by the machine.

01:03.246 --> 01:04.885
As an investigative
writer that has yet

01:04.885 --> 01:08.255
to be officially published,

01:08.256 --> 01:11.256
I can relate to Mario's desire.

01:12.761 --> 01:17.761
Subtitle Re-Synced to this release by SubSync.net

01:19.266 --> 01:21.565
That's me behind the wheel,

01:21.566 --> 01:26.166
Jay Bahadur, proud college
graduate of the class of 2007,

01:26.176 --> 01:28.105
arguably the worst year

01:28.106 --> 01:30.005
since the Great Depression
to graduate school,

01:30.006 --> 01:32.876
but timing was
never my strength.

01:37.645 --> 01:43.016
In fact, good timing seems to be
at odds with my very existence,

01:43.026 --> 01:46.186
but like many
unpleasantries in life,

01:46.196 --> 01:48.856
you just learn to deal with it.

02:07.746 --> 02:09.776
- Afternoon, shoppers...
- Yo.

02:09.786 --> 02:12.984
Hey, man. Is Mark Reiss here?

02:12.985 --> 02:15.815
- Reissy? Oh, he left.
- Shit, really?

02:15.825 --> 02:17.015
- Yeah.
- Damn it,

02:17.025 --> 02:18.724
he was supposed to be here.

02:18.725 --> 02:20.324
- It's kind of lousy out,
if you didn't notice.

02:20.325 --> 02:23.355
He left early. Are you
interviewing for stock boy or...

02:23.365 --> 02:26.694
- Me? No.
- My name is Jay Bahadur.

02:26.695 --> 02:30.864
I'm doing market research
on premium napkins.

02:30.865 --> 02:33.204
Mind if I ask you
a few questions?

02:33.205 --> 02:39.244
- Your name isn't even on here.
- I assure you, I am legit.

02:39.245 --> 02:40.714
- You drove all the way
from Toronto

02:40.715 --> 02:43.244
to ask questions about napkins?

02:43.245 --> 02:47.145
- Premium napkins.
- Thought my job sucked.

02:47.155 --> 02:49.083
- Could you show your
paper product aisle?

02:49.084 --> 02:52.223
- But I'm just kind of busy.

02:52.224 --> 02:55.994
- Is there a reason why the six
...reason why the six pack

02:55.995 --> 02:58.295
This thing does not like me.

03:10.144 --> 03:14.213
Is there a reason why
the six pack paisley napkins

03:14.214 --> 03:21.014
are here and not here?

03:21.015 --> 03:22.984
It's not a trick question.

03:22.985 --> 03:25.423
- I... I think because it was just
easier putting them on the floor

03:25.424 --> 03:29.323
than on the top shelf.

03:29.324 --> 03:33.324
- And would making our packaging
more festive make you consider

03:33.334 --> 03:37.834
moving the premium napkins
to the top shelf?

03:42.274 --> 03:44.173
You're probably thinking

03:44.174 --> 03:46.004
that a person
with my intellectual capacity

03:46.014 --> 03:47.413
would loathe waiting for
that gentleman's answer

03:47.414 --> 03:49.443
to my question.

03:49.444 --> 03:52.983
But actually,
I feel quite the contrary.

03:52.984 --> 03:54.383
- I would just leave them
on the bottom shelf, man.

03:54.384 --> 03:57.253
- It's less work.
- Less work.

03:57.254 --> 03:59.923
Understanding what drives a mind
to react the way

03:59.924 --> 04:03.792
it does to things
never ceases to amaze me.

04:03.793 --> 04:07.392
My careful documentation of this
one man's opinion could,

04:07.393 --> 04:10.295
in its own way,
reshape the patterns of napkins

04:10.305 --> 04:15.934
on every home on this street,

04:15.944 --> 04:20.172
including that one,
my ex-high school girlfriend,

04:20.173 --> 04:22.712
Tracy Zicconi's house.

04:22.713 --> 04:25.042
The darkened second-floor
window just a reminder

04:25.043 --> 04:30.252
that she now resides
1,825 miles away at Stanford.

04:30.253 --> 04:33.022
And I know it's 1,825 miles away

04:33.023 --> 04:35.854
because I have an obsession
with Google Maps,

04:35.864 --> 04:38.723
not with my ex-high
school girlfriend.

04:47.403 --> 04:50.272
I was raised as a non-practicing
Hindu-Christian

04:50.273 --> 04:53.003
half-Indian living
at this address.

04:53.013 --> 04:56.512
This is the home of Kailash
and Maria Bahadur.

04:56.513 --> 04:58.843
My well-laid-out graduation plan

04:58.853 --> 05:00.852
was only to visit my former
residence on festive holidays

05:00.853 --> 05:03.852
such as Canadian
Thanksgiving and Christmas,

05:03.853 --> 05:08.392
perhaps offering my skills at
turkey basting or tree trimming,

05:08.393 --> 05:12.292
but this was 2008.

05:12.293 --> 05:14.792
Plans evaporated.

05:14.793 --> 05:18.031
Upon my graduation from the
esteemed University of Toronto,

05:18.032 --> 05:22.201
my parents had decided
to give me my own mailbox.

05:22.202 --> 05:24.302
They saw it as a way in which
to somehow legitimize

05:24.303 --> 05:27.203
my residence in their basement.

05:27.213 --> 05:28.942
The funny thing was
that the mailman

05:28.943 --> 05:30.312
refused to deliver
my mail there,

05:30.313 --> 05:32.212
so Mom would sort the mail

05:32.213 --> 05:34.782
and deliver it herself
after each delivery.

05:46.092 --> 05:48.131
"Dear Mr. Bahadur,
the editorial staff

05:48.132 --> 05:49.832
"at 'Vanity Fair' has reviewed
your story submission,

05:49.833 --> 05:53.201
"and we unfortunately do not
feel

05:53.202 --> 05:54.371
"it's something we would like
our magazine

05:54.372 --> 05:56.401
"to pursue at this time.

05:56.402 --> 05:57.542
We wish you the best of luck
at other publications..."

05:57.543 --> 06:00.371
Blah fucking blah.

06:00.372 --> 06:03.372
Why do all rejection letters
have the word "unfortunately"

06:03.382 --> 06:05.481
in the first sentence?

06:05.482 --> 06:09.212
Surely there is a more original
adverb to toss in there.

06:09.222 --> 06:13.482
I vow that I will never
write for a publication

06:13.492 --> 06:17.021
that uses the word
"unfortunately"

06:17.022 --> 06:20.022
in their first sentence.

06:20.032 --> 06:22.462
I am better than that.

06:47.192 --> 06:49.020
Come on.

06:49.021 --> 06:54.091
Jared? Jared?
Jared.

06:56.391 --> 06:59.161
- Is that my Red Bull?
- No.

06:59.171 --> 07:02.000
- Look at me.

07:02.001 --> 07:03.901
- Mom says you got to shovel
the snow in the driveway

07:03.902 --> 07:05.602
so Dad can get in.

07:05.612 --> 07:07.340
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.

07:07.341 --> 07:11.380
- You're not doing anything.
- Doing homework.

07:11.381 --> 07:14.610
- Uh, where's mom?
- The elusive pink

07:14.611 --> 07:17.211
fairy armadillo
has been known to...

07:17.221 --> 07:19.881
- Mom? Mom?

07:19.891 --> 07:21.350
- Yeah?

07:21.351 --> 07:23.551
- Why do I have to
shovel the driveway?

07:23.561 --> 07:27.359
- Your father and I
discussed this with you, Jay,

07:27.360 --> 07:31.260
about ways for you
to contribute rent, remember?

07:31.261 --> 07:34.471
And I'm so sorry about
your rejection letter.

07:35.401 --> 07:38.141
Ahh!

07:39.941 --> 07:43.110
- Yo!
- Ahh!

07:43.111 --> 07:46.509
Are you, like, earning some
extra allowance or something?

07:46.510 --> 07:48.649
- I'm starting to wonder why
I didn't commit teen suicide

07:48.650 --> 07:50.479
- when I could.
- Amen.

07:50.480 --> 07:53.320
Yo, bro, you want to, like,
hit Parrots with us?

07:53.321 --> 07:55.590
- Can't. I got to submit
my research numbers.

07:55.591 --> 07:57.320
They got to be
in Chicago by tomorrow.

07:57.321 --> 07:59.260
- Then fake it.
- I can't, man.

07:59.261 --> 08:01.660
They figure out all sorts
of stuff based off my results.

08:01.661 --> 08:04.159
- Like what?
- Like what holiday paisleys

08:04.160 --> 08:05.999
are popular and stuff.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.699
- Okay, bro, you lost me.

08:07.700 --> 08:09.330
- Journalistic integrity,

08:09.340 --> 08:10.969
it's gonna be worth
something on the resume

08:10.970 --> 08:12.600
when I apply to Harvard's
journalism school.

08:12.610 --> 08:16.509
- Right, right.
- Hey, I got an idea for a story

08:16.510 --> 08:17.940
I'm gonna submit.
It came to me when I was

08:17.941 --> 08:19.710
listening to CBC Radio today.

08:19.711 --> 08:21.279
- What's... what's the angle?

08:21.280 --> 08:23.479
- The end of the comedic
dictator.

08:23.480 --> 08:26.449
Kim Jong is on his death bed,
and once he goes,

08:26.450 --> 08:29.619
where's the dictator
comedy gonna come from?

08:29.620 --> 08:33.359
- Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
- He's funny and very alive.

08:33.360 --> 08:35.229
- He's not funny.

08:35.230 --> 08:37.229
- He's a little funny.

08:37.230 --> 08:39.559
- He's a little funny, but no
one can pronounce his name.

08:39.570 --> 08:42.068
- Your story is flawed, bro.

08:42.068 --> 08:45.039
- You guys want to hear
something fucked up?

08:45.040 --> 08:47.969
Tracy's getting engaged.

08:47.970 --> 08:51.139
- Where did you hear that shit?
- Mm, Kate.

08:51.140 --> 08:54.040
She said she saw
it posted on Facebook.

08:54.050 --> 08:57.249
She's gonna marry her
Lit professor.

08:57.250 --> 09:00.148
- No way. Tracy is repulsed
by older men.

09:00.149 --> 09:01.388
- You were older.

09:01.389 --> 09:03.588
- Two years is not older, man!

09:03.589 --> 09:05.588
- It's a little bit older.

09:05.589 --> 09:08.029
- Fuck you, Crowe.

09:08.030 --> 09:11.229
- Hey, are you sure you don't
want to hit Parrots with us?

09:11.230 --> 09:12.760
- No, dude, I got to...

09:12.770 --> 09:16.599
- Do some shit nobody
gives a fuck about?

09:16.600 --> 09:18.498
- Exactly.

09:18.499 --> 09:20.538
- All right, well,
that is your loss,

09:20.539 --> 09:24.708
but if you change your mind,
please hit us up.

09:24.709 --> 09:27.748
- You got it. Later, dudes.
- See you, buddy.

09:27.749 --> 09:31.278
- See you.

09:31.279 --> 09:34.590
- Fucking moron.
- What?

09:39.019 --> 09:41.659
- Ahh! Ahh!

09:44.729 --> 09:46.428
- Name's Bahadur, here

09:46.429 --> 09:48.098
to see Dr. Fleshman
about my back.

09:48.099 --> 09:50.268
- Have you ever been here
before?

09:50.269 --> 09:52.038
- No.
- All right, you'll just need

09:52.039 --> 09:56.237
- to fill out these forms.
- Right.

09:56.238 --> 09:57.408
- You okay?

09:57.409 --> 10:00.378
- Yeah, I just hurt my back,

10:00.379 --> 10:02.709
figured I'd get a jump
on being a senior citizen.

10:10.189 --> 10:15.088
- So, you busting on grey hairs?
- To make a move on Kaitlyn, eh?

10:18.528 --> 10:20.527
- Excuse me?

10:20.528 --> 10:22.429
- That's all right,
I understand.

10:22.439 --> 10:26.468
I'd take down all of humanity
just to bang her.

10:26.469 --> 10:30.438
- Seymour.
- Ooh. I was just talking.

10:30.439 --> 10:32.807
I'm trying to keep it
a level playing field.

10:32.808 --> 10:34.847
- Yeah, leave him alone.
- You know what I'm saying.

10:34.848 --> 10:38.447
Sorry. What happened
to your back?

10:38.448 --> 10:41.147
- Sh-shoveling.
- Shoveling?

10:41.148 --> 10:45.117
- Yeah.
- I got, uh, shrapnel moving

10:45.118 --> 10:47.258
around the vertebrae.

10:47.259 --> 10:49.328
It's a bitch.

10:49.329 --> 10:51.397
- Well, sounds like I got the
better end of the deal in here.

10:51.398 --> 10:53.358
- Oh, bullshit.

10:53.368 --> 10:59.398
Shoveling? I hate shoveling.
Pointless waste of time, no?

10:59.408 --> 11:02.407
Name's Seymour Tolbin.

11:02.408 --> 11:05.537
- Ah.
- Oh, oh, sorry.

11:05.538 --> 11:10.346
- Wait, Seymour Tolbin?
- Yeah.

11:10.347 --> 11:12.447
- The... who writes for
"The Daily Mail?"

11:12.448 --> 11:15.247
- Wrote.
- I'm retired, sort of.

11:15.248 --> 11:17.317
But that's right. That's me.

11:17.318 --> 11:18.887
- Holy fuck.

11:18.888 --> 11:23.127
You are one of my favorite
journalists of all time.

11:23.128 --> 11:26.427
- Come on. You Facebook people
have favorite journalists?

11:26.428 --> 11:28.726
- You were one of the
first reporters who had the guts

11:28.727 --> 11:31.466
to report the Battle of
Ong Thanh as a loss.

11:31.467 --> 11:35.166
- That's...
- So you're a journalist?

11:35.167 --> 11:37.137
- No. Well, I mean, yeah,
I want to be,

11:37.138 --> 11:39.438
but I can't... I just... you know,

11:39.448 --> 11:42.547
I haven't taken a...
I never took a class,

11:42.548 --> 11:44.917
but I'm seriously... I'm thinking
about going back

11:44.918 --> 11:46.346
to get a degree.

11:46.347 --> 11:48.586
Harvard is the... is the goal.

11:48.587 --> 11:52.617
- Oh, how can you say
something stupid like that?

11:52.627 --> 11:55.227
- What...
- Why do you think journalism

11:55.228 --> 11:56.887
is a pile of "People" magazine,

11:56.897 --> 12:02.327
"She got cellulite on her
Dumpster" crap right now?

12:02.328 --> 12:05.897
Journalism isn't taught.
It's innate.

12:05.907 --> 12:08.236
You know what I'm saying?

12:08.237 --> 12:11.376
You think the shrapnel
in my back landed there

12:11.377 --> 12:14.476
because I was using my head?

12:14.477 --> 12:16.346
No way.

12:16.347 --> 12:19.416
- So what are you saying?
- I'm saying fuck Harvard,

12:19.417 --> 12:21.316
is what I'm saying.

12:21.317 --> 12:23.485
Fuck Harvard.

12:23.486 --> 12:28.386
You want to make it as some big
swinging dick journalist?

12:28.387 --> 12:33.226
You got to go somewhere
fucking crazy.

12:33.227 --> 12:35.296
- Somewhere where Western
reporters would consider

12:35.297 --> 12:37.196
it too dangerous to go,

12:37.197 --> 12:41.465
like, write as a stringer
from there, get a book going.

12:41.466 --> 12:42.966
It's the only way out.

12:42.976 --> 12:47.536
- Yeah, that makes sense, man.
- That makes sense.

12:47.546 --> 12:51.515
Where you thinking of going?

12:51.516 --> 12:56.416
- Somalia.

12:56.417 --> 12:58.316
- Hmm?
- Like, I... I bought a...

12:58.317 --> 13:01.985
An umbrella from a Somali once.

13:01.986 --> 13:03.725
- What does that mean?

13:03.726 --> 13:05.655
- That means where's
the fucking conflict,

13:05.656 --> 13:08.225
besides the fact that they
machete reporters to death?

13:08.226 --> 13:09.626
- In Somalia the seeds
of democracy

13:09.636 --> 13:11.295
are growing amidst anarchy.

13:11.296 --> 13:12.835
I did a paper on it
my freshman year.

13:12.836 --> 13:14.835
- So?

13:14.836 --> 13:16.967
- So it's a misunderstood place.

13:16.977 --> 13:20.005
- Bro, democracy is not topical,
all right?

13:20.006 --> 13:22.745
No... nobody wants
to understand Somalia.

13:22.746 --> 13:26.615
- Did you know in Somaliland
they held an election

13:26.616 --> 13:31.485
where the minority clan won the
presidential office by 80 votes,

13:31.486 --> 13:33.516
and there was no violence?

13:33.526 --> 13:35.685
The transition of power
was peaceful.

13:35.686 --> 13:38.794
- It was peaceful because nobody
bothered reporting on it.

13:38.795 --> 13:43.665
You need to listen to me.
You want conflict?

13:43.666 --> 13:46.935
You want to tell the story
from both sides?

13:46.936 --> 13:48.805
Go to Sudan.

13:48.806 --> 13:53.675
There's your ticket,
not Somalia.

13:53.676 --> 13:58.014
- I don't know, man. I got
a good grade on that paper.

13:58.015 --> 14:00.975
Somalia and me are copacetic.

14:00.985 --> 14:03.314
Is a Mr. Trey Williamson here?

14:03.315 --> 14:05.714
- Just left.
- Shit, really?

14:05.715 --> 14:07.855
My name is, uh, Jay Bahadur.

14:07.856 --> 14:09.525
I'm here to conduct
a marketing research...

14:09.526 --> 14:12.355
- Who's the guy eating Doritos
on my aisle?

14:12.356 --> 14:16.025
- That's my associate,
Mr. Felcher.

14:16.035 --> 14:19.064
- I have to clean that shit up.
- I'm so sorry, man.

14:19.065 --> 14:20.895
- Would you please...
- Continue maestro.

14:20.905 --> 14:23.804
- Refrain from eating
in this poor man's aisle?

14:23.805 --> 14:25.404
And just start to pick that up.

14:25.405 --> 14:26.405
- I got it.
- Thank you.

14:26.406 --> 14:27.804
- I got it.

14:27.805 --> 14:30.644
- And where is your, uh,
napkin aisle?

14:30.645 --> 14:32.375
- Aisle seven.
- Seven.

14:32.376 --> 14:34.314
- Hey, uh, Jay?

14:34.315 --> 14:35.944
I think you should
check this shit out.

14:35.945 --> 14:38.084
- I thought we agreed
you would be silent, bro.

14:38.085 --> 14:41.655
- No, bro, I really think
you should check this out.

14:43.425 --> 14:47.425
Would you excuse me
for a moment? Thank you.

14:47.795 --> 14:49.725
- What the fuck, man?
- The rebels,

14:49.735 --> 14:51.563
who Kenyan officials
liken to seagoing pirates

14:51.564 --> 14:54.064
have taken captive the MV Faina,

14:54.065 --> 14:56.804
a Ukrainian vessel,
off the Somali coast,

14:56.805 --> 14:59.474
and they're demanding
an untold ransom.

14:59.475 --> 15:01.844
Our correspondent, Mitch Kelp,
has more on the story

15:01.845 --> 15:05.374
from outside the U.S.
embassy in Nairobi.

15:05.375 --> 15:07.475
Mitch, what more
can you tell us?

15:07.485 --> 15:09.084
- Well, Chrissy,
not a whole lot.

15:09.085 --> 15:10.983
We are going off
an official press release

15:10.984 --> 15:12.853
from the Kenyan government.

15:12.854 --> 15:14.953
We don't have
a single source in Somalia,

15:14.954 --> 15:16.923
and I'm sure as shit not gonna
get my ass shot over there

15:16.924 --> 15:19.523
trying to find out
what would possess these, um...

15:19.524 --> 15:21.724
Possess these crackheads
to take an unarmed tanker.

15:21.725 --> 15:24.564
- Hmm. Well, Mitch, word here is
our corporate insurance policy

15:24.565 --> 15:26.495
wouldn't cover you
in that hellhole,

15:26.505 --> 15:28.503
and they'd hate to have
a lawsuit from your family

15:28.504 --> 15:31.703
on their hands when they mail
you back in pieces.

15:31.704 --> 15:34.703
- Thank corporate for
being so considerate, Chrissy.

15:34.704 --> 15:37.043
Back to you.

15:37.044 --> 15:40.574
- So until we can find
one crazy motherfucker

15:40.584 --> 15:43.944
to head over to Somalia
and find out what's going on,

15:43.954 --> 15:47.053
we'll continue to take
uneducated guesses

15:47.054 --> 15:50.684
as to who these pirates are.

15:50.694 --> 15:53.454
Bahadur, answer the phone!

15:53.464 --> 15:55.763
- And you've got to put
your bodies upon the gears

15:55.764 --> 15:59.533
and upon the wheels...

15:59.534 --> 16:00.894
- Hello?

16:00.904 --> 16:03.633
- Hello?
- Is this Mr. Jay Bahadur?

16:03.634 --> 16:05.573
- Yeah.
- This is Mohamad Farole

16:05.574 --> 16:08.542
from Radio Garowe
over in Somalia.

16:08.543 --> 16:10.503
I got your email.

16:10.513 --> 16:12.743
So you are wanting to come
to Somalia for a book.

16:12.744 --> 16:14.743
You are writing on the pirates,

16:14.744 --> 16:16.944
and you're looking for people
to talk to here, right?

16:16.954 --> 16:19.814
- Yes, exactly.
- I must say that is more than

16:19.824 --> 16:22.984
any other reporter
has been willing to do.

16:22.994 --> 16:24.992
You are the first Westerner

16:24.993 --> 16:27.553
to actually ask to come see
what's going on here.

16:27.563 --> 16:30.792
- That's unfortunate.
- Yes, yes, it's true.

16:30.793 --> 16:32.962
I'll have a conversation
with my father,

16:32.963 --> 16:35.732
- accommodate your request.
- Okay, okay.

16:35.733 --> 16:38.903
And, uh, how... uh,
you think your father

16:38.904 --> 16:41.644
will be able
to make this happen?

16:41.645 --> 16:44.703
- I would hope so.
- He is our president.

16:50.713 --> 16:54.852
- Assalamu alaikum.
- Uhh.

16:54.853 --> 16:57.522
- That's Somali for hello.

16:57.523 --> 17:01.962
I suggest you learn it, Bahadur.
I'm out of cigars.

17:01.963 --> 17:04.592
Want to walk with me?

17:04.593 --> 17:06.632
- Okay.

17:06.633 --> 17:07.962
Yeah, this guy Farole called.

17:07.963 --> 17:09.663
I just sent out some feelers

17:09.673 --> 17:11.132
to a few Somali news
services, and boom.

17:11.133 --> 17:13.032
- The president's son
calls you back.

17:13.042 --> 17:14.571
- Yes! I never

17:14.573 --> 17:16.041
get a break like that, never.

17:16.042 --> 17:18.712
- Well, uh, you create
your own reality, chief.

17:18.713 --> 17:19.872
- Well, if that was true,
we would all live

17:19.882 --> 17:21.540
in a solipsistic universe

17:21.541 --> 17:22.942
wherein we could do
whatever we wanted

17:22.952 --> 17:24.541
without any further
consequences.

17:24.551 --> 17:26.613
- What the fuck
are you talking about?

17:26.623 --> 17:28.722
- Michael Topper, author of
"Channeling UFOs"

17:28.723 --> 17:30.822
and "The Positive/Negative
Realms Beyond This World?"

17:30.823 --> 17:33.692
- You read too much.
- Fuck more girls, instead.

17:33.693 --> 17:40.061
Speaking of which, I read
that writing sample you gave me.

17:40.062 --> 17:41.961
- Bad?

17:41.962 --> 17:44.931
- Why the fuck would you
write a piece

17:44.932 --> 17:48.841
on how to get away
without paying parking tickets?

17:48.842 --> 17:51.042
- I thought people would laugh.
- Laugh?

17:51.043 --> 17:53.743
Parking tickets pay
for the roads.

17:53.744 --> 17:56.681
The roads get you
out of this shit hole.

17:56.682 --> 17:59.281
- So you hated it?
- No, actually.

17:59.282 --> 18:01.112
I liked it.

18:01.122 --> 18:04.251
It's not the second
coming of Hunter S. Thompson,

18:04.252 --> 18:08.561
but you write
with a good conscience.

18:08.562 --> 18:09.791
- You think?
- Yeah.

18:09.792 --> 18:12.061
Don't let it go to your head.

18:12.062 --> 18:15.100
Bravo.

18:15.101 --> 18:20.301
So Avril Benoit,
you know who she is?

18:20.302 --> 18:22.271
- Yeah, uh, she's on CBC Radio.

18:22.272 --> 18:24.741
She did a great report
on Kenya a few weeks ago.

18:24.742 --> 18:28.842
- Exactly.
- She's a friend of mine, uh,

18:28.843 --> 18:33.281
and I want to put you
in contact with her.

18:33.282 --> 18:34.980
- Okay.

18:34.981 --> 18:38.650
- She's a good one
for feeding pages to.

18:38.651 --> 18:42.321
So you got... you got
a book outline?

18:42.322 --> 18:44.222
- No.
- Wrong.

18:44.232 --> 18:47.031
You're formulating one, okay?

18:47.032 --> 18:49.301
- I haven't. I mean, this is
all happening so fast.

18:49.302 --> 18:51.571
I just... I Googled
"Somalia press,"

18:51.572 --> 18:53.100
found Farole's name,
and sent out a blind email.

18:53.101 --> 18:54.870
I had no idea this was
gonna blow up, none.

18:54.871 --> 18:57.870
- Bahadur, you got
a book outline?

18:57.871 --> 18:59.610
- No! That's what I'm trying
to tell you...

18:59.611 --> 19:06.051
- Stop! Try again.
- You got a book outline?

19:06.052 --> 19:07.851
- I'm formulating it.

19:07.852 --> 19:09.951
- I knew you'd get it
on the third try.

19:09.952 --> 19:11.720
Come on, let's go.

19:11.721 --> 19:16.790
So how much do you know
about Somalia?

19:16.791 --> 19:18.830
- Uh, well, I did a term paper

19:18.831 --> 19:20.860
on it my freshman year
at university, so.

19:20.861 --> 19:22.260
- That's good.

19:22.261 --> 19:26.000
Don't tell me the grade.
It's a start.

19:26.001 --> 19:27.900
Immerse yourself in it.

19:27.901 --> 19:29.339
You dig cigars?

19:29.340 --> 19:32.010
- I never understood cigars.

19:32.011 --> 19:34.071
- That's clever,
don't you think, Jo?

19:34.081 --> 19:37.310
Okay. Save this.

19:37.311 --> 19:41.280
By the time this thing
is over, you will.

19:41.281 --> 19:44.881
Jo, thank you.

19:44.891 --> 19:48.789
What else don't you understand?
I need to know that.

19:48.790 --> 19:51.689
- The Jays are going to lose
Burnett to the Yanks.

19:51.690 --> 19:54.229
They offered him 82.5 million
over five years.

19:54.230 --> 19:57.730
- Can you believe that?
- I have an announcement.

19:57.731 --> 20:02.170
- What kind of announcement?
- Yes, what kind?

20:02.171 --> 20:07.170
- Uh, I'm gonna go to Somalia

20:07.180 --> 20:10.209
and write a book on the pirates,

20:10.210 --> 20:12.409
try to get
some stories published.

20:12.410 --> 20:17.080
- Somalia?
- I know what you're thinking.

20:17.090 --> 20:21.020
I know you're thinking
it's batshit crazy, but I think

20:21.021 --> 20:25.059
this is the only way
for me to become a journalist.

20:25.060 --> 20:28.029
- AIDS.
- AIDS?

20:28.030 --> 20:31.160
- Isn't that a problem there?
- I believe so,

20:31.170 --> 20:33.999
but I'm going to write
about the pirates,

20:34.000 --> 20:36.440
Dad, not sleep with them.

20:42.080 --> 20:46.849
Excuse me,
it's my Somali contact.

20:46.850 --> 20:52.320
Assalamu alaikum.

20:52.321 --> 20:55.719
Shifted?

20:55.720 --> 20:59.890
- He needs to do more yoga.
- His shoulders are bad.

20:59.900 --> 21:02.259
- Assalam... ciao.

21:09.739 --> 21:15.109
- You okay, sweetheart?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

21:15.110 --> 21:16.309
I was wrong though.

21:16.310 --> 21:18.079
- Wrong?
- Yeah, apparently

21:18.080 --> 21:20.210
there's an additional
$500 security deposit

21:20.220 --> 21:21.478
I didn't account for.

21:21.479 --> 21:25.018
- 500?
- Security deposit?

21:25.019 --> 21:27.419
- Yeah, just for, you know...
- You know, for, like, uh,

21:27.420 --> 21:31.259
vehicles and such, insurance
policies, things like that.

21:34.829 --> 21:37.000
Can I borrow $500?

21:41.239 --> 21:44.338
- Welcome about flight 823 now
departing for Frankfurt.

21:44.339 --> 21:46.108
At this time
we'd like you to put away

21:46.109 --> 21:47.208
- all your electronic devices...
- Excuse me, sir.

21:47.209 --> 21:48.978
All cell phones must be off.

21:48.979 --> 21:50.378
- It's just final words
to my ex-girlfriend

21:50.379 --> 21:52.448
before I had to Somalia.

21:52.449 --> 21:56.879
I'm, uh, basically looking for
a little sympathy, maybe a wow.

21:56.889 --> 22:01.758
Personally, between me and you,
I'd settle for an LOL.

22:01.759 --> 22:03.920
- Off, please.
- Right, right, sorry.

22:03.930 --> 22:05.758
I want to take
a moment now to say

22:05.759 --> 22:07.289
that not all the characters
in this film

22:07.299 --> 22:08.758
are exactly like
they are in real life,

22:08.759 --> 22:11.059
except for that stewardess.

22:11.069 --> 22:13.529
I felt she needed to be
depicted completely accurately

22:13.539 --> 22:16.537
in her total lack
of empathy for my pain.

22:16.538 --> 22:18.537
Thankfully I only had to spend
the next eight hours

22:18.538 --> 22:20.207
of my journey with her,

22:20.208 --> 22:22.137
and then I'd get
a new stewardess,

22:22.138 --> 22:24.307
and then another stewardess,
and then another.

22:24.308 --> 22:26.108
In fact, I might have set

22:26.109 --> 22:28.009
a connecting
flight record to Somalia,

22:28.019 --> 22:30.448
but see, this was all part
of my master plan,

22:30.449 --> 22:33.188
a fixed budget that would
allow me to write my book,

22:33.189 --> 22:34.888
and unlike several
of my predecessors

22:34.889 --> 22:36.887
who ventured to
where that flag is,

22:36.888 --> 22:39.989
I'd say alive, as kidnapping
and killing journalists

22:39.999 --> 22:41.438
had become an
unfortunate trend here.

23:16.998 --> 23:18.128
Dude.

23:26.468 --> 23:29.477
Fuck! Stop!

23:29.478 --> 23:33.307
Stop the fucking... Seymour?

23:33.317 --> 23:35.316
Tracy?

23:35.317 --> 23:37.047
I thought you were
repulsed by older men!

23:41.988 --> 23:43.387
- Please calm down!
- Make out with me!

23:43.388 --> 23:48.157
Make out with me now!
Ahh!

23:48.158 --> 23:50.026
Believe it or not,
that is what I consider

23:50.027 --> 23:51.427
a mild Tracy nightmare.

23:51.428 --> 23:55.166
Sorry, sorry, man.

23:55.167 --> 23:57.097
In order to
clear my mind of its negativity,

23:57.107 --> 23:59.406
I'll take a moment now to focus
on the less fortunate

23:59.407 --> 24:04.037
than myself,
the people of Somalia.

24:04.047 --> 24:07.547
Hard to believe this land was
once known as a nation of poets.

24:07.548 --> 24:10.046
Throughout their history,
the Somali poet was counted on

24:10.047 --> 24:12.116
to defend a clan's honor.

24:12.117 --> 24:13.916
They used poems of persuasion

24:13.917 --> 24:16.586
in lieu of weapons
to settle disputes,

24:16.587 --> 24:19.887
but in the 20th century
times changed.

24:19.897 --> 24:21.256
Both the English
and the Italians

24:21.257 --> 24:23.557
attempted to colonize them.

24:23.567 --> 24:25.566
They introduced guns
into battle,

24:25.567 --> 24:28.665
and although Somalia
valiantly refused to succumb,

24:28.666 --> 24:32.306
the scars of war never relented.

24:32.307 --> 24:35.306
Somalia's recent civil war
had caused over a million people

24:35.307 --> 24:38.476
to flee to neighboring
countries as refuges.

24:38.477 --> 24:42.676
Those who stayed faced droughts,
floods, famine,

24:42.677 --> 24:45.685
feuding clan battles, and jihad.

24:45.686 --> 24:48.915
Their newly-elected President
Farole had his hands full,

24:48.916 --> 24:52.525
especially when you threw
in the pirates.

24:52.526 --> 24:55.126
I arrived at my destination
city of Galkayo,

24:55.127 --> 24:57.526
and into the fire I plunged,

24:57.527 --> 25:02.168
or as my Somali translation
book said, "Dabka."

25:10.006 --> 25:13.206
Holy fuck.

25:15.046 --> 25:17.145
- Mr. Bahadur? Mr. Bahadur.
- Hi.

25:17.146 --> 25:19.216
- Hi, welcome to Galkayo.
- Oh, thank you.

25:19.217 --> 25:22.285
- Yes. I am Abdirizak.
- You call me Abdi.

25:22.286 --> 25:23.685
I am your translator.

25:23.686 --> 25:25.055
- Cool. Good to meet you.

25:25.056 --> 25:26.455
- Good to meet you, yes.

25:26.456 --> 25:29.995
- How was your flight?
- It was good.

25:29.996 --> 25:33.595
- That's good. Oh, please don't
do the... with your finger here.

25:33.596 --> 25:35.195
- This?
- Yes. Oh, please...

25:35.196 --> 25:37.035
- Oh, no, I'm sorry.
- I didn't know.

25:37.036 --> 25:38.466
I'm... I'm so sorry. I...

25:38.467 --> 25:40.235
- It's offensive.

25:40.236 --> 25:41.404
- I'll keep the thumbs in
check. Thank you.

25:41.405 --> 25:43.134
- Yes, yes.
- Yeah.

25:43.135 --> 25:45.375
- Your English is great.
- It's not perfect.

25:45.376 --> 25:49.115
I try to learn from you
during your stay, Mr. Bahadur.

25:49.116 --> 25:51.476
- Oh, please call me Jay.
- Jay?

25:51.486 --> 25:53.045
- Yeah, Jay.

25:53.046 --> 25:55.355
- Jay, you have one bag?
- Yeah, one bag.

25:55.356 --> 25:58.285
- Oh, you're like Obama,
a man that knows what he wants.

25:58.286 --> 26:00.085
- You know Obama?

26:00.095 --> 26:01.724
- Of course. He will be great
leader for your people.

26:01.725 --> 26:04.294
- Oh, I'm Canadian.
- He's... he's not my leader.

26:04.295 --> 26:05.724
- Of course he is.

26:05.725 --> 26:08.465
Your people just don't know it.
Come.

26:11.666 --> 26:15.636
â™ª

26:17.705 --> 26:25.015
â™ª

26:28.055 --> 26:31.284
So I hear you are
an author and journalist.

26:31.285 --> 26:35.125
- Yes.
- Good, good.

26:35.126 --> 26:38.124
There is so much to write
about in this country.

26:38.125 --> 26:39.594
What is your subject?

26:39.595 --> 26:41.094
- In a perfect world
I'd be writing

26:41.095 --> 26:43.034
about your newfound democracy,

26:43.035 --> 26:44.795
but, um, given the fact

26:44.805 --> 26:48.665
that the West has broken off
all relations with you, um,

26:48.675 --> 26:50.735
I'm here to write
about your pirates.

26:50.745 --> 26:55.073
- You mean badaadinta badah?
- Bada-binda-bada? What is that?

26:55.074 --> 26:58.543
- It means saviors of the sea.
- They are like Coast Guard.

26:58.544 --> 27:00.745
You can never call them pirates.

27:00.755 --> 27:02.714
- Okay. That's good to know.

27:02.715 --> 27:07.524
- They have very strong opinion
on this, never pirates.

27:07.525 --> 27:10.355
- Are they easy to find?
- Yes, of course.

27:10.365 --> 27:13.524
They are people
with crazy money.

27:13.534 --> 27:15.063
- So they walk freely?

27:15.064 --> 27:17.663
- Yes, but our new
President Farole

27:17.664 --> 27:19.603
has promised to change this.

27:19.604 --> 27:22.633
He is a very tough man
who will bring much change.

27:22.634 --> 27:26.276
Ah!

27:31.085 --> 27:33.243
- Is everything okay?
- Yes, yes.

27:33.244 --> 27:35.714
It's okay?

27:37.454 --> 27:39.253
- Yes, yes.

27:39.254 --> 27:41.853
Sometimes I feel like father
with little children.

27:41.854 --> 27:43.654
They need khat.

27:43.664 --> 27:46.464
- Khat.
- Yes. We must stop up here.

27:54.774 --> 27:56.503
- In Somalia one hour
and already shooting

27:56.504 --> 27:58.734
my first drug deal,

27:58.744 --> 28:02.313
my kind of country.

28:02.314 --> 28:05.513
So khat is a drug?

28:05.514 --> 28:09.752
- Yes, it's... it's a stimulant
leaf from Kenya and Ethiopia.

28:09.753 --> 28:15.123
It's very addictive,
big problem here.

28:15.124 --> 28:19.823
What's he saying?

28:19.824 --> 28:22.663
- He wants to know
if you want to buy some.

28:22.664 --> 28:25.503
- Oh, no, I... I... sorry,

28:25.504 --> 28:27.433
I'm on a very fixed budget.

28:27.434 --> 28:29.473
I didn't account for drug
money. I don't have any...

28:41.554 --> 28:43.753
He wants you to try it.

28:43.754 --> 28:47.622
- It won't kill you.
- Yes, just bite down.

28:47.623 --> 28:49.722
- What's the effects?

28:49.723 --> 28:51.922
- Makes some people
want to have sex,

28:51.923 --> 28:55.323
others very talkative.

28:58.603 --> 29:00.302
- Ugh! Tracy was a great girl,

29:00.303 --> 29:01.463
but, you know, she... what... what
are you gonna do?

29:01.473 --> 29:02.872
She moves on. I move on.

29:02.873 --> 29:04.672
I really doubt we'll ever
even talk again.

29:04.673 --> 29:06.402
I mean, why bother, right?
Seems like a waste of time.

29:06.403 --> 29:07.772
I mean, it's just gonna
confuse thing and make it

29:07.773 --> 29:09.212
- more difficult.
- Men and women

29:09.213 --> 29:10.942
- can't be friends.
- Exactly!

29:10.943 --> 29:12.443
Exactly, that's
the same over here?

29:12.444 --> 29:14.882
- Yes, it's a universal thought.

29:14.883 --> 29:16.782
- See, where I come
from, they debate it.

29:16.783 --> 29:18.952
They debate it like
morons, like idiots.

29:18.953 --> 29:22.822
- It's not a debate. It's fact.
- We're reaching a checkpoint.

29:22.823 --> 29:24.792
Please stay calm.

29:51.282 --> 29:54.322
- Ah, Mr. Bahadur..

29:54.323 --> 29:55.792
- Hi.
- So we finally meet

29:55.793 --> 29:57.722
- face to face, huh?
- Yes, nice to meet you.

29:57.723 --> 30:01.361
- Nice to meet you, sir. Abdi.

30:01.362 --> 30:03.961
You are younger than
I pictured, somewhat.

30:03.962 --> 30:05.961
- Ah.
- Western reporters to me

30:05.962 --> 30:09.471
are always so fucking unhappy.

30:09.472 --> 30:13.501
- Well, I get even better
once I shower.

30:13.502 --> 30:15.771
- Come on, come on.
- Has Abdi been good to you?

30:15.772 --> 30:17.672
- Yes, mad good, yeah.

30:17.682 --> 30:20.281
- He's the best translator
in all of Puntland, you know?

30:20.282 --> 30:21.681
- Oh, no, really?
- Yeah.

30:21.682 --> 30:23.351
We stole him from the pirates.

30:23.352 --> 30:26.521
- Oh, you mean, uh,
badaadinta badah?

30:26.522 --> 30:27.821
- Abdi, did you teach him this?

30:27.822 --> 30:29.451
- Ah...
- This is not

30:29.452 --> 30:31.491
our Coast Guard, Abdi,
they are pirates!

30:31.492 --> 30:34.591
You must forget
the old guard's thinking.

30:34.592 --> 30:36.291
They are pirates!

30:36.292 --> 30:40.461
- Pirates.

30:40.471 --> 30:42.030
- Mr. Jay.
- Hi.

30:42.031 --> 30:44.701
- So what do you think of
the Radio Garowe newsroom?

30:44.702 --> 30:46.401
- Nice.

30:46.402 --> 30:48.841
- Does it look like
the ones in Canada?

30:48.842 --> 30:50.272
- Yes.

30:50.282 --> 30:51.672
Yes, it does, a bit, yeah.

30:51.682 --> 30:53.411
- It's amazing, huh?

30:53.412 --> 30:55.311
- Is it a local station or, um...
- Oh, one minute.

30:55.312 --> 30:57.811
- Okay. Okay.
- Yeah, mostly it's local,

30:57.821 --> 30:59.550
but, you know,
the guy is very famous.

30:59.551 --> 31:01.581
- He used to work for...
- This guy, famous?

31:04.361 --> 31:06.890
That was my father's office.
He wants to meet us now.

31:06.891 --> 31:08.661
- Your father?
- The... the president?

31:08.662 --> 31:11.892
- Yeah, we must go now.

31:11.902 --> 31:13.901
- Fuck.

31:13.902 --> 31:17.570
- Pirates are not the most
cooperative group to deal with.

31:17.571 --> 31:21.501
- Mm-hmm.
- Look here.

31:21.511 --> 31:24.971
The main pirates' clan
are dotted around here.

31:24.981 --> 31:27.580
- Eyl.
- You know Eyl?

31:27.581 --> 31:29.380
- Yeah, that's where
they took the Farhina

31:29.381 --> 31:31.050
and held it for six months.

31:31.051 --> 31:34.420
- Precisely. Eyl is a fishing
town where they started.

31:34.421 --> 31:37.851
I'm working on getting you
a meeting with Boyah.

31:37.861 --> 31:40.760
- Boyah?
- Yes, he's a man Somali

31:40.761 --> 31:42.760
calls Robin Hood.

31:42.761 --> 31:48.861
- Robin Hood of the pirates?
- But it could take some time.

31:48.871 --> 31:54.669
- How much time?
- Days, maybe weeks.

31:54.670 --> 31:56.909
Is that a problem?

31:56.910 --> 31:58.610
- No. No, no, that's fine.
- No?

31:58.611 --> 32:00.010
- That's totally fine, yeah.
- Yeah?

32:00.011 --> 32:01.710
- Yeah.
- Okay.

32:01.711 --> 32:03.080
- Yeah, I'll just... I'll call
my publisher

32:03.081 --> 32:06.650
and make sure it's all set,

32:06.651 --> 32:08.521
finances,
extending it, and everything.

32:27.541 --> 32:30.939
- My father just got in here
a couple weeks ago.

32:30.940 --> 32:35.140
The transition of government
was entirely peaceful.

32:50.790 --> 32:52.999
This is the reporter,
Jay Bahadur.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.060
- It's an honor to meet you,
Your Excellency.

32:55.070 --> 32:56.899
- Welcome, Mr. Bahadur.

32:56.900 --> 33:00.439
So my son tells me you're
the next Mr. Bob Woodward.

33:00.440 --> 33:03.169
- I'm not so sure about that.
- Why aren't you sure?

33:03.170 --> 33:04.839
You have made it farther
into Somalia

33:04.840 --> 33:06.908
than any of
your Western counterparts.

33:06.909 --> 33:10.509
- With all due respect, uh,
I've always considered myself

33:10.519 --> 33:12.819
more of a Bernstein
than a Woodward.

33:12.820 --> 33:15.149
Bernstein was ugly as hell
and never got through college.

33:15.150 --> 33:18.989
Overcame his shortcomings.
Uh, I find that admirable.

33:18.990 --> 33:22.189
- He's a funny guy.
- Very funny.

33:22.190 --> 33:24.191
- I would like to introduce you
to Colonel Omar,

33:24.201 --> 33:29.998
who'll be the head of your
security team during your stay.

33:29.999 --> 33:32.938
- Welcome.
- Pleasure to meet you, Colonel.

33:32.939 --> 33:34.538
- I'll protect you well,
Mr. Bahadur.

33:34.539 --> 33:38.709
You're welcome.

33:38.710 --> 33:44.148
- You have learned some Somali?
- Enough to be a bad tourist.

33:44.149 --> 33:46.878
Um, is this okay?

33:46.879 --> 33:48.918
- Of course.
- That's why you're here.

33:48.919 --> 33:52.458
My family and I spent our last
eight years in Australia...

33:52.459 --> 33:55.658
- Is there a reason the six
pack paisley napk... are...

33:55.659 --> 33:57.558
- And we...
- Not here?

33:57.559 --> 33:59.959
Sorry. I'm so sorry,
Your Excellency. I'm just, uh...

33:59.960 --> 34:01.727
I think because
it was just...

34:01.728 --> 34:03.168
Trying to get this dang
thing working here.

34:03.169 --> 34:07.069
Festive... festive...

34:10.239 --> 34:12.808
Good to go.

34:12.809 --> 34:16.648
- The people of Somalia asked me
to come back here

34:16.649 --> 34:19.777
and to run for this office.

34:19.779 --> 34:23.717
I never saw myself
being the president.

34:23.717 --> 34:25.217
I am a businessman.

34:25.217 --> 34:27.719
I am not a warrior
like my predecessors,

34:27.728 --> 34:30.257
but here I am,
fighting to bring justice

34:30.259 --> 34:33.859
to those who destroy
our country.

34:33.869 --> 34:37.768
Have you seen a school since
you've come here, Mr. Bahadur?

34:37.768 --> 34:39.937
- Uh, no, I must
admit I haven't.

34:39.938 --> 34:43.067
- We have the fewest schools
in the African nations.

34:43.068 --> 34:48.777
Do you know how hard it is
to rule here with a PhD

34:48.777 --> 34:54.079
knowing the children I lead
have no chance for an education?

34:54.089 --> 34:58.117
Their role models
of success are pirates.

34:58.118 --> 35:01.957
The Western world thinks
we encourage this.

35:01.958 --> 35:06.627
This must change.

35:06.628 --> 35:09.297
Do you have a title yet?

35:09.298 --> 35:10.929
- A title?

35:10.939 --> 35:13.167
- For your future
bestselling book.

35:13.168 --> 35:16.906
- Oh. Um, yes, of course.

35:16.907 --> 35:21.807
Um, "Pirates."

35:21.808 --> 35:23.747
- That's shit title.

35:23.748 --> 35:26.247
Just "Pirates?"

35:26.248 --> 35:31.948
- "Pirates of Somalia."
- Be more creative.

35:31.958 --> 35:33.117
- Be more creative.
- Creative?

35:33.118 --> 35:34.817
- Yeah.
- Creative.

35:34.827 --> 35:40.757
- Creative
- Yes, creative, you're right.

35:40.767 --> 35:43.567
- Jay, you know,
my father likes you.

35:43.568 --> 35:46.168
- What, you think so?
- Yes, yes.

35:46.169 --> 35:47.798
- All right.

35:47.808 --> 35:51.637
- He knows you will bring
great things here.

35:51.638 --> 35:55.606
- What if I don't?

35:55.607 --> 35:58.876
- How can you not when people
read your bestseller?

35:58.877 --> 36:00.777
- Ohh.

36:00.787 --> 36:03.616
- Abdi, have you
found Boyah yet?

36:03.617 --> 36:06.356
- Mm.
- Oh, you must be patient, man.

36:06.357 --> 36:08.358
- Yeah.
- He will show up.

36:10.358 --> 36:12.856
They're gonna take you
to your accommodations.

36:12.857 --> 36:16.126
- Wow. Thank you, uh,
so much for everything.

36:16.127 --> 36:18.327
- That's the beginning
of a better Somalia, Jay.

36:18.337 --> 36:20.966
- Yes, I certainly hope so.
- Yes.

36:20.967 --> 36:22.667
- Yes.
- Have a good night.

36:22.668 --> 36:24.736
- You too, good night.
- Good night.

36:24.737 --> 36:31.847
â™ª

36:39.657 --> 36:41.986
- Welcome, welcome.

36:41.987 --> 36:43.656
- Yeah.

36:43.657 --> 36:48.057
- You will be here
the next six months.

36:48.067 --> 36:50.726
- Great.
- Yes. This is my cousin.

36:52.866 --> 36:56.105
Hi, Jay.

36:56.106 --> 36:58.007
- I'll work on that.
- Mm-hmm.

36:58.008 --> 37:00.036
- Nice to meet you.
- We call him the Yellow Chair.

37:00.037 --> 37:01.806
- Yellow Chair?

37:01.807 --> 37:03.646
Oh, 'cause there's
a yellow chair, I get it.

37:03.647 --> 37:05.687
- He's a little crazy, yes.
- I get it. That's good.

37:07.316 --> 37:10.345
- Hi.

37:10.346 --> 37:12.215
- I tell them
you're a white ghost.

37:12.216 --> 37:15.055
- Why the fuck
did you do that, man?

37:15.056 --> 37:17.425
- They've never seen
a white man before. It's okay.

37:17.426 --> 37:21.256
They are my sister's kids.
I live up there.

37:21.266 --> 37:22.726
- All right.
- Mm.

37:22.727 --> 37:24.796
- Third floor?
- It's... yes.

37:24.797 --> 37:26.965
It's... it's usually
very quiet here.

37:26.966 --> 37:28.396
- Okay, that's great.

37:28.406 --> 37:31.835
- Although it's... it gets hot
from the sun,

37:31.836 --> 37:35.305
and thanks to you we are
the only people with Internet.

37:35.306 --> 37:36.875
- What?
- Yes, that alone

37:36.876 --> 37:40.075
is worth you being my guest.

37:40.076 --> 37:41.415
- Thank you.
- Glad I could be

37:41.416 --> 37:44.085
- of some service to you.
- Yes.

37:44.086 --> 37:49.216
- Oh, wow, nice.
- Nice hall.

37:49.226 --> 37:52.825
So yes, I need to advise you,
keep that closed.

37:52.826 --> 37:54.256
- Really?
- The whole time.

37:54.266 --> 37:56.165
There are orders
from the colonel, Omar.

37:56.166 --> 37:59.326
- He's not into sunshine?
- He's into keeping you alive.

37:59.336 --> 38:02.296
- Fair enough.

38:02.306 --> 38:04.334
Oh, cute.

38:04.335 --> 38:07.134
- And yes, uh, we are
very sorry, uh, no hot water.

38:07.135 --> 38:09.336
Welcome to Somalia, yeah.

38:09.346 --> 38:11.244
No worries. I'll make do.

38:11.245 --> 38:13.015
Was thinking about growing
it out. What do you think?

38:13.016 --> 38:14.876
- Oh, hair on the face
is very popular here.

38:14.886 --> 38:16.285
- Yeah?
- Yes.

38:16.286 --> 38:17.985
- Good. That's great.
- Good idea.

38:17.986 --> 38:19.285
You have a mosquito net?

38:19.286 --> 38:21.085
- I do, definitely.
- Good.

38:21.086 --> 38:24.385
Malaria is very rampant
here, as well as rats,

38:24.395 --> 38:26.994
so any valuable, any food,

38:26.995 --> 38:29.195
you must keep it inside the box.

38:33.035 --> 38:35.995
- Cool, just like camp.

38:36.005 --> 38:37.805
Well, thanks
for everything, Abdi.

38:37.806 --> 38:39.475
- Yes, uh, welcome. Good night.

38:39.476 --> 38:41.174
Anything you need, uh,
let me know.

38:41.175 --> 38:42.374
- Okay, perfect, thank you.

38:42.375 --> 38:44.244
Oh, uh, one last thing.

38:44.245 --> 38:47.475
Um, I kind of like to work
with things taped on the walls.

38:47.485 --> 38:49.075
- Is that okay?
- Oh, it's okay,

38:49.085 --> 38:52.014
as long as no pornography, eh?

38:52.015 --> 38:53.954
- Not a problem.
- Because small, little kids

38:53.955 --> 38:55.284
- come, walk in.
- Yeah, no.

38:55.285 --> 38:56.854
- So... so no...
- Please, yeah.

38:56.855 --> 38:58.154
- Okay. Bye.
- All right.

38:58.155 --> 39:00.854
Good night.

39:00.864 --> 39:03.325
- Bye-bye.
- Thank you. Night.

39:08.395 --> 39:13.335
Can't open the fucking window.

39:16.345 --> 39:23.384
â™ª

39:53.975 --> 39:56.284
- Ahh! Oh, shit!
- Oh, shit!

39:56.285 --> 39:58.884
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit, oh, shit.

40:02.924 --> 40:05.354
Oh, shit.

40:08.824 --> 40:12.863
Ugh, rats.

40:58.173 --> 41:01.043
Ahh.

41:13.223 --> 41:19.992
Garowe, Somalia, December 10,
2008, a view from my room.

41:19.993 --> 41:22.493
I've broken security measures
and opened my window.

41:25.203 --> 41:27.672
Holy shit.

41:35.143 --> 41:39.182
Opening the windows?

41:39.183 --> 41:41.482
You got a knack
for living dangerously, bro.

41:41.483 --> 41:43.483
- Sorry, man. Totally worth it.

41:43.484 --> 41:46.951
That girl was mad hot. Wow.

41:46.952 --> 41:49.421
- She's... she's one
of Garaad's wives.

41:49.422 --> 41:51.261
- Who's... who's Garaad?

41:51.262 --> 41:53.531
- Garaad, he's a pirate,
and he's, uh,

41:53.532 --> 41:57.002
one of the most powerful men
in all of Puntland.

41:57.003 --> 42:00.132
- Really?
- Her name is Maryan.

42:00.133 --> 42:03.972
- Maryan.
- She sells khat in the market.

42:03.972 --> 42:06.441
- Mm, whoa, khat dealer?

42:06.442 --> 42:08.572
- That's where all these
pretty girls

42:08.582 --> 42:11.642
are going, to sell khat.

42:11.652 --> 42:14.551
- Is it possible to conduct
an interview with her?

42:14.552 --> 42:19.383
- With her, it's not advisable.

42:19.393 --> 42:22.153
- Well, how do we meet Garaad?
- Garaad?

42:22.163 --> 42:24.591
- Yeah.
- No, no, no, no.

42:24.592 --> 42:26.291
We are avoiding this guy.

42:26.292 --> 42:28.192
- No. Dude, I didn't come...
- This guy...

42:28.202 --> 42:30.361
- No, I didn't
come here to avoid.

42:30.362 --> 42:31.601
- He's dangerous.

42:31.602 --> 42:33.971
He's a very dangerous man, so...

42:33.972 --> 42:35.971
- And Boyah isn't?
- I mean, come on.

42:35.972 --> 42:39.141
- Well, you'll find out Boyah.

42:39.142 --> 42:40.541
- What does that mean?

42:40.542 --> 42:42.510
- We're going now. Let's go.
- Now?

42:42.511 --> 42:46.081
- I set up a meeting, yes, now.
- Shit, let's go.

42:46.082 --> 42:48.252
- Let's go. Okay.

43:02.631 --> 43:07.471
â™ª

43:52.351 --> 43:57.049
- Where's he going?

43:57.050 --> 43:59.580
- Now me and you meet him
under the tree.

43:59.590 --> 44:01.451
Come.

44:01.461 --> 44:04.790
- Okay. Okay.

44:04.791 --> 44:06.160
You know those
out-of-body experiences

44:06.161 --> 44:07.561
where you look around and say,

44:07.562 --> 44:10.260
"This shit
isn't happening to me?"

44:10.261 --> 44:12.061
My only one I could compare it
to was when I got pulled over

44:12.071 --> 44:13.430
for speeding in Kitchener.

44:13.431 --> 44:14.730
Cop asked me
to step out of the car

44:14.740 --> 44:17.269
'cause I had a blunt
in the ashtray.

44:17.270 --> 44:21.370
- What is a blunt?
- You know, grass, marijuana.

44:21.380 --> 44:23.709
- That isn't tolerated
in America?

44:23.710 --> 44:25.541
- I'm Canadian.

44:25.551 --> 44:28.650
- Sorry, bro, I forget.

44:28.651 --> 44:30.250
- Well, please don't forget
when I get shot here.

44:30.251 --> 44:32.680
I want my body sent
to the right country.

44:32.690 --> 44:35.850
- No one will shoot you.
- Maimed, whatever.

44:45.630 --> 44:48.530
- He wants to know
what's your shirt.

44:48.540 --> 44:50.670
- My shirt?
- Yes.

44:50.671 --> 44:53.339
- Uh, this is a Blue Jays shirt.

44:53.340 --> 44:58.840
It's the, uh, baseball
team in Toronto.

45:05.590 --> 45:09.419
- He wants to know
who wears the number 15.

45:09.420 --> 45:10.658
- 15?

45:10.659 --> 45:13.828
Uh, that's my man, Alex Rios.

45:13.829 --> 45:16.729
Uh, he's, uh, what you call
a five-tool player.

45:16.730 --> 45:18.201
No one can touch him
in my opinion.

45:27.840 --> 45:31.779
- He say as Somali people
number five is very important.

45:37.779 --> 45:40.419
- As we pray five times a day,

45:40.420 --> 45:43.759
and they say the liar
has five religions.

45:43.760 --> 45:46.859
- Maybe that five explains
why Rios is such a monster.

45:51.199 --> 45:54.730
All right, uh...

45:54.740 --> 45:59.738
So Boyah,
um, Westerners call you

45:59.739 --> 46:03.309
a, uh... a pirate.

46:17.359 --> 46:19.219
- He's saying he's not a pirate.

46:19.229 --> 46:22.858
He is someone
defending his oceans.

46:22.859 --> 46:24.697
- Badaadinta badah?
- Yes.

46:24.698 --> 46:29.830
Yeah.

46:29.840 --> 46:33.739
- He was a lobster diver
from Eyl.

46:39.649 --> 46:42.508
- The Westerners come, Chinese,
the Koreans, uh...

46:45.288 --> 46:46.918
- And they
overfished the waters.

46:50.658 --> 46:53.857
- So they must pay for
their illegal actions.

46:53.858 --> 46:55.589
- So you attack
their fishing vessels.

47:00.998 --> 47:04.898
- He takes the taxes that the
government's supposed to take.

47:04.908 --> 47:06.768
That's all he's doing.

47:06.769 --> 47:11.407
And they never kill anyone.

47:11.408 --> 47:13.347
Never?

47:13.348 --> 47:16.917
- Yes, he said never,
not his men.

47:16.918 --> 47:19.717
- Who are your merry men?

47:19.718 --> 47:21.718
Or men... just say men.

47:27.688 --> 47:30.028
- It's 500 men based in Eyl.

47:37.868 --> 47:39.736
- He's the one that
gathered them together,

47:39.737 --> 47:45.007
and he's also the one
that pays them their wages.

47:45.008 --> 47:47.877
- Wow, impressive.

47:47.878 --> 47:52.848
So how do you pick someone
worthy of your confederation?

48:02.557 --> 48:05.396
- First, he must own
his own gun.

48:05.397 --> 48:07.896
That's why he show you the gun.

48:07.897 --> 48:12.638
- Right.
- And they must be ready to die.

48:14.338 --> 48:17.477
- He wants to know
if you have khat for him.

48:17.478 --> 48:18.877
- Khat?

48:18.878 --> 48:21.847
No, uh, sorry, I... no,
I... wha...

48:26.587 --> 48:28.947
What the fuck?
What just happened?

48:28.957 --> 48:30.686
- You were supposed to bring
the khat to him!

48:30.687 --> 48:32.486
- I'm supposed to bring drugs
to this interview?

48:32.487 --> 48:34.055
- Yeah, you should know.
- You didn't tell me that!

48:34.056 --> 48:35.387
How am I supposed to know that?

48:35.397 --> 48:36.756
- You didn't research it?

48:36.757 --> 48:38.426
- It's not on fucking
Google, man.

48:38.427 --> 48:40.426
I don't know what to tell you.

48:40.427 --> 48:42.027
- Yeah, you don't come to
with no khat.

48:42.037 --> 48:44.697
- Great.
- Jay Bahadur, now you know.

48:44.707 --> 48:47.407
Mm.

48:58.946 --> 49:02.116
- CBC, Avril Benoit's office.
- Hi, this is Jay Bahadur.

49:02.117 --> 49:03.586
I'm calling for Ms. Benoit.

49:03.587 --> 49:05.417
I believe she's expecting
my call.

49:05.427 --> 49:07.656
- One moment, please.

49:07.657 --> 49:09.826
Avril, I have a Jay Bahadur
on the line.

49:09.827 --> 49:12.056
He says you're
expecting his call.

49:12.066 --> 49:16.365
- I don't know a Jay Bahadur.
- Okay.

49:16.366 --> 49:18.465
I'm sorry, she can't be
reached at the moment.

49:18.466 --> 49:20.635
Uh, can she return, Mr. Bahadur?

49:20.636 --> 49:23.835
- No, it'd be impossible
to return. I need to talk now.

49:23.836 --> 49:25.676
It's critical.

49:25.677 --> 49:28.447
- Well, unfortunately,
she's unavailable.

49:28.448 --> 49:30.516
- No! Please, uh...

49:30.517 --> 49:32.845
- What's your name?
- Beth.

49:32.846 --> 49:35.785
- Beth, hey, Beth.

49:35.786 --> 49:38.785
Um, there's gonna be a moment

49:38.786 --> 49:42.086
when you're not on
that desk screening calls,

49:42.096 --> 49:44.595
and you're gonna need a break,
a single tiny break

49:44.596 --> 49:47.025
from the assistant
on the other end,

49:47.026 --> 49:49.565
and that karma
is gonna be paid off

49:49.566 --> 49:54.005
by giving me a break
in this very moment.

49:54.006 --> 49:56.975
- You think it gets me a raise?
- Definitely.

49:56.976 --> 50:01.775
Just tell her
that I'm in Somalia.

50:01.776 --> 50:05.777
- Okay, fine. You win.

50:05.787 --> 50:08.614
Jay Bahadur says
he's calling from Somalia.

50:08.615 --> 50:11.515
- Oh, shit.
- Jesus, yeah, I'll take it.

50:11.525 --> 50:12.915
Hello, this is Avril Benoit.

50:12.925 --> 50:15.586
- Hi, Ms. Benoit.
- This is Jay Bahadur.

50:15.596 --> 50:17.555
I believe Seymour
told you about me.

50:17.556 --> 50:20.025
- Yes, yes. Are you really
calling from Somalia?

50:20.026 --> 50:22.665
- Yes, I'm in Garowe,
all limbs intact.

50:22.666 --> 50:23.965
- Jesus.
- Look, I sent you

50:23.966 --> 50:25.934
a proposal, uh,
regarding a book

50:25.935 --> 50:27.734
I'm writing on the pirates.

50:27.735 --> 50:29.704
I don't know if you had
a chance to review it.

50:29.705 --> 50:32.574
- I'm gonna be honest
with you, Jay, I haven't.

50:32.575 --> 50:34.074
Are you really there?

50:34.075 --> 50:36.474
- Yes, yes, I am.

50:36.475 --> 50:40.016
Um, I'm being hosted
by President Farole's son.

50:40.017 --> 50:41.886
- Christ, this is unreal.

50:41.887 --> 50:44.984
No one's in there,
CNN, BBC, no one.

50:44.985 --> 50:46.685
- Yeah, I know.

50:48.995 --> 50:50.054
- Oh, shit.

50:50.055 --> 50:51.794
- What the fuck was that?

50:51.795 --> 50:53.694
- Ten minutes,
my... my phone card's out.

50:53.695 --> 50:56.625
I... I'm... I'm tagging along

50:56.635 --> 50:59.095
with a pirate the locals
claim is like Robin Hood.

50:59.105 --> 51:00.964
He runs this huge
operation out of Eyl.

51:00.965 --> 51:03.733
It is my hope that I can be
a stringer with you,

51:03.734 --> 51:06.004
and if you really see
something in the pages,

51:06.005 --> 51:08.044
you could help me
get a book deal.

51:08.045 --> 51:10.244
Will... will you read my pages?

51:10.245 --> 51:12.175
- Yes.
- Yes!

51:12.185 --> 51:14.014
Thank you. Thank you so much.

51:14.015 --> 51:15.846
Uh, I'm a huge fan, by...

51:15.856 --> 51:19.785
- He said he was a lobster
diver from Eyl.

51:25.594 --> 51:28.825
- The Westerners come,
Chinese, the Koreans.

51:31.235 --> 51:33.965
- Jay! Gabar!

51:38.005 --> 51:39.834
- You're a good wingman, Asad.

51:39.844 --> 51:44.543
Nice! Nice, buddy. Yes!

51:44.544 --> 51:47.643
What?

51:47.644 --> 51:49.913
What does that mean?

51:49.914 --> 51:54.825
Keep your eyes on her, man.

51:56.795 --> 51:59.694
Go, baby, go, baby, go.
Go, baby, go.

52:05.794 --> 52:07.303
- You took the chair.

52:07.304 --> 52:09.904
You took the chair.
You took the chair.

52:12.904 --> 52:20.014
â™ª

52:48.574 --> 52:52.074
â™ª

52:52.084 --> 52:56.043
For the record, I am a complete
and utter disbeliever in destiny

52:56.053 --> 52:59.082
bringing two lovers together.

52:59.083 --> 53:01.722
It is a merely mathematical
probability that you will meet

53:01.723 --> 53:06.222
the ultimate girl
of your dreams in your lifetime.

53:06.223 --> 53:09.363
These odds are increased
slightly by reckless behavior

53:09.364 --> 53:13.702
and naivetÃ©.

53:13.703 --> 53:17.603
That is how I met Maryan.

53:32.112 --> 53:36.083
Assalamu alaikum Jay.

53:36.093 --> 53:39.294
- Assalamu alaikum, Maryan.

53:41.264 --> 53:45.962
- Yes, I see you in the window.
- You speak English.

53:45.963 --> 53:49.762
- A little.
- Where did you learn?

53:49.772 --> 53:52.901
- I watch a lot
of American movies.

53:52.902 --> 53:54.701
- Movies?

53:54.702 --> 53:59.112
- Yeah. I love.
- That makes two of us.

53:59.113 --> 54:00.742
- Yes?
- Yeah.

54:00.743 --> 54:02.912
Uh, got movie posters
all over my room.

54:02.913 --> 54:04.212
What's your favorite movie?

54:04.213 --> 54:07.322
- I like "G.I. Jane."
- Really?

54:07.323 --> 54:12.691
- Yeah. I like Demi Moore.
- She's a very tough woman.

54:12.692 --> 54:14.862
- Yeah, especially
with that buzz cut.

54:14.863 --> 54:16.762
It's super butch.

54:16.763 --> 54:18.892
I'm sure Demi Moore
would be honored, though,

54:18.902 --> 54:21.801
to have a Somali fan club.

54:21.802 --> 54:26.832
- The movie I think is
very wrong is "Black Hawk Down."

54:26.842 --> 54:29.941
- Because, uh, it's about
what went down in Mogadishu?

54:29.942 --> 54:34.111
- No, because it's about
our people,

54:34.112 --> 54:39.251
and they do not use a single
person from Somalia in it.

54:39.252 --> 54:41.982
It is wrong.

54:41.992 --> 54:46.151
- I didn't know that.
- Yes.

54:46.161 --> 54:49.222
"Derka derka Mohammed jihad,"

54:49.232 --> 54:53.731
That's what they were doing
the whole pathetic film.

54:53.732 --> 54:56.962
- You just did "Team America."
That's crazy. Wow.

54:56.972 --> 55:00.901
- Yes, "Team America"
said many smart things.

55:00.902 --> 55:04.010
- This conversation
is getting surreal.

55:04.011 --> 55:06.940
- You know this city
talks about you?

55:06.941 --> 55:09.280
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

55:09.281 --> 55:11.310
- What are they saying?

55:11.311 --> 55:14.981
- They're saying you're here
to expose the truth

55:14.982 --> 55:18.391
about the badaadinta badah.

55:18.392 --> 55:19.791
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

55:19.792 --> 55:22.960
- Well, I mean, I am trying,

55:22.961 --> 55:27.931
but, uh,
what do you think about them?

55:27.932 --> 55:30.500
- I'm not the person to ask.

55:30.501 --> 55:33.000
I'm married to one.

55:33.001 --> 55:35.840
- Garaad.
- So you know?

55:35.841 --> 55:38.441
- I know, yeah.
- He's a very powerful man.

55:38.442 --> 55:40.141
I'm trying to meet him.

55:40.142 --> 55:44.310
- Yeah, you and I
both want that meeting.

55:44.311 --> 55:47.080
- You don't see him much?

55:47.081 --> 55:50.381
- Not since I married him, no.

55:50.391 --> 55:52.190
- Well, you'd be
a better treasure

55:52.191 --> 55:54.790
than anything he'd find
on one of those ships.

55:54.791 --> 55:57.760
- That's an American movie line.

55:57.761 --> 55:58.761
- Yes.

55:58.762 --> 56:00.929
Maybe. I don't know.

56:00.930 --> 56:02.862
But it's good though, right?

56:02.872 --> 56:06.931
And true.

56:06.941 --> 56:10.470
- You here for khat, yes?
- Yeah.

56:10.471 --> 56:14.810
- So how much do you want?
- Uh, I don't know.

56:14.811 --> 56:17.380
You... you take
foreign money, right?

56:17.381 --> 56:19.010
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah?

56:19.020 --> 56:21.280
Okay. Uh, how much
will this get me?

56:24.320 --> 56:27.459
- Wow, enough to make you crazy.

56:27.460 --> 56:30.221
- Yeah, that's what
I'm talking about.

56:33.161 --> 56:34.860
- Jay.

56:34.861 --> 56:36.899
- I think it's time
to see Boyah again.

56:36.900 --> 56:38.870
- Is that khat?
- No, it's spinach.

56:38.871 --> 56:40.370
Yes, it's khat.

57:00.260 --> 57:06.190
- So tell me, Boyah,
how do you attack?

57:10.270 --> 57:11.600
- We attack in small groups.

57:14.240 --> 57:16.899
- And we circle them
like wolves.

57:34.059 --> 57:36.859
â™ª

57:52.409 --> 57:56.979
â™ª

58:11.589 --> 58:13.658
Yeah, bro!

58:13.659 --> 58:20.969
â™ª

58:35.149 --> 58:37.549
â™ª

58:45.959 --> 58:48.258
Jay! Jay.

58:49.928 --> 58:53.028
- Ah,

58:53.038 --> 58:55.568
That's... Whoa!

59:07.678 --> 59:09.678
Hello? Hello?

59:09.688 --> 59:12.248
- Hello, Jay?
- Can you see me okay?

59:12.258 --> 59:14.217
- Yeah, it's... I can.

59:14.218 --> 59:15.618
It's kind of a bad connection.

59:15.628 --> 59:18.327
- Oh, yeah, damn technology.

59:18.328 --> 59:20.727
- Yeah, do you want
to call me back maybe?

59:20.728 --> 59:22.559
- Uh, no, no, I can't.

59:22.569 --> 59:24.397
I'm kind of pressed
for time right now.

59:24.398 --> 59:28.037
- Okay, um, did you get
a response on my pages?

59:28.038 --> 59:31.737
- Yeah, uh, unfortunately
not everyone here

59:31.738 --> 59:36.339
is sharing the enthusiasm
I've got for them.

59:36.349 --> 59:42.346
- Did you say "unfortunately?"
- Yes.

59:42.347 --> 59:44.446
- Shit.

59:44.447 --> 59:49.157
- My colleagues feel that
as a book it's missing a hook.

59:49.158 --> 59:50.987
- A hook?

59:50.988 --> 59:53.227
Boyah's Captain fucking Hook
minus the eye patch.

59:53.228 --> 59:55.358
- I know. I'm... I'm as
shocked as you are.

59:55.368 --> 59:58.267
The material you're getting
is incredible.

59:58.268 --> 01:00:00.296
I... I didn't see this coming.

01:00:00.297 --> 01:00:03.636
Look, the three top-selling
books this year are "Twilight,"

01:00:03.637 --> 01:00:08.306
"New Moon," and "Breaking Dawn,"
so don't take it personal.

01:00:08.307 --> 01:00:10.106
We're all up
against vampires, okay?

01:00:10.107 --> 01:00:12.409
- Personal? Avril, these people
are desperate!

01:00:12.419 --> 01:00:14.578
No one is willing to listen
to what they have to say!

01:00:14.579 --> 01:00:17.317
- I'm sorry, Jay. I really am.

01:00:17.318 --> 01:00:20.386
Just know that
I'm on your side, okay?

01:00:20.387 --> 01:00:24.056
- Okay.
- Are you okay?

01:00:24.057 --> 01:00:26.056
- Yeah.

01:00:26.057 --> 01:00:28.126
- Look, I don't... I don't know
if you'd be interested,

01:00:28.127 --> 01:00:31.426
but I've heard that
CBS is willing to pay $1,000

01:00:31.427 --> 01:00:34.136
for any video of hostages
on the ships.

01:00:34.137 --> 01:00:35.497
- Is this your way of saying
it's a dead end

01:00:35.507 --> 01:00:38.566
- with your contacts?
- No.

01:00:38.567 --> 01:00:43.376
I know it's crazy
and borderline sensationalism,

01:00:43.377 --> 01:00:45.546
but it can really
get you out there.

01:00:45.547 --> 01:00:47.716
It could help sell this book.

01:00:47.717 --> 01:00:50.217
Plus I know money
must be tight for you right now.

01:00:50.218 --> 01:00:51.546
I've been there.

01:00:51.547 --> 01:00:56.355
- Right.
- Just keep at it, Jay.

01:00:56.356 --> 01:00:59.086
I'm gonna continue
to push for you on this end.

01:00:59.096 --> 01:01:01.295
There's a book here.

01:01:01.296 --> 01:01:04.366
- Okay. Okay, thanks, Avril.

01:01:04.367 --> 01:01:07.066
- One more little
piece of advice,

01:01:07.067 --> 01:01:10.166
you might want to organize
your cards a little better.

01:01:10.167 --> 01:01:12.306
It's a pet peeve of mine.

01:01:12.307 --> 01:01:17.446
I just... I find it makes your
flow of thoughts more concise.

01:01:26.317 --> 01:01:30.756
- Fuck! Fuck!

01:01:30.757 --> 01:01:34.356
Fucking fuck!

01:01:36.866 --> 01:01:38.365
Hey, bro, uh...

01:01:38.366 --> 01:01:40.165
- Jay.
- Can we talk?

01:01:40.166 --> 01:01:41.495
- Now?
- Yeah.

01:01:41.496 --> 01:01:43.735
- Come.
- Thanks.

01:01:43.736 --> 01:01:45.605
Thanks, man. How you doing?
Sorry to wake you up, man.

01:01:45.606 --> 01:01:50.305
I'm just having a hard time,
man, you know?

01:01:50.306 --> 01:01:52.306
I trust you, man.

01:01:52.316 --> 01:01:54.215
- Thank you.
- No, I mean that, you know?

01:01:54.216 --> 01:01:56.445
Like, I really... I really trust
you because, you know,

01:01:56.446 --> 01:01:57.845
I don't really have
many people that I trust,

01:01:57.846 --> 01:02:00.147
and you're, like,
one of those people, so.

01:02:00.157 --> 01:02:01.816
- Is there something
troubling you, bro?

01:02:01.817 --> 01:02:03.455
- Don't call me bro, please.

01:02:03.456 --> 01:02:05.325
Call me Jay.

01:02:05.326 --> 01:02:06.755
If you still want to call me bro
after I finish telling you

01:02:06.756 --> 01:02:09.856
what I'm telling you,
then that's fine.

01:02:09.866 --> 01:02:11.324
- Okay.
- What I say has to stay

01:02:11.325 --> 01:02:12.864
between us, I mean it.

01:02:12.865 --> 01:02:15.795
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:02:15.805 --> 01:02:18.866
Um, all right,

01:02:18.876 --> 01:02:25.645
Uh...

01:02:25.646 --> 01:02:28.175
I'm not a famous journalist,

01:02:28.176 --> 01:02:32.214
and I don't have a book deal.

01:02:32.215 --> 01:02:36.185
- Okay.
- No, it's not okay.

01:02:36.186 --> 01:02:38.354
Everyone here thinks
I'm a famous reporter.

01:02:38.355 --> 01:02:44.225
That's why I'm here,
but I'm a fucking no one.

01:02:44.226 --> 01:02:47.195
- Jay...

01:02:47.196 --> 01:02:51.434
you are the only reporter

01:02:51.435 --> 01:02:53.604
willing to risk their life

01:02:53.605 --> 01:02:56.874
to show the struggle
of Somali people.

01:02:56.875 --> 01:03:00.374
- Yes, yes, I know,
but you're missing the point.

01:03:00.375 --> 01:03:03.875
I'm not a reporter, okay?

01:03:03.885 --> 01:03:05.484
I thought I could come here

01:03:05.485 --> 01:03:08.454
and get a book deal
or publish some stuff

01:03:08.455 --> 01:03:11.385
once I sent some pages
to editors,

01:03:11.386 --> 01:03:13.186
but they rejected me, man.

01:03:13.196 --> 01:03:14.454
They fucking rejected me
like every other

01:03:14.455 --> 01:03:17.524
piece of shit
I've written! Fuck!

01:03:17.525 --> 01:03:19.364
Sorry. Sorry.

01:03:19.365 --> 01:03:22.364
- They rejected your work?
- Yeah.

01:03:22.365 --> 01:03:24.264
If Farole finds out,
I'm fucking dead.

01:03:24.265 --> 01:03:25.933
I'm dead. He's gonna kill me.

01:03:25.934 --> 01:03:29.434
- Perhaps yes, perhaps no.
- He understands rejection.

01:03:29.444 --> 01:03:30.834
It's a human trait.

01:03:30.844 --> 01:03:33.644
- I shouldn't have
come here, man.

01:03:33.645 --> 01:03:35.744
I'm a fucking idiot.

01:03:35.745 --> 01:03:38.244
- Don't say that, Jay.
- Don't say that.

01:03:38.245 --> 01:03:40.445
- You had no choice.
- Yeah.

01:03:40.455 --> 01:03:41.954
I came here with the noble idea

01:03:41.955 --> 01:03:43.583
of exposing the truth,

01:03:43.584 --> 01:03:48.694
and I lied
to everyone around me.

01:03:48.695 --> 01:03:50.934
- You wake me in the middle
of the night to tell me this?

01:03:54.734 --> 01:03:58.634
- I came here
to ask you a favor.

01:03:58.635 --> 01:04:01.833
- Ask me.
- Yeah, okay.

01:04:01.834 --> 01:04:08.413
I need you to help me get on
a ship and film some hostages.

01:04:08.414 --> 01:04:10.874
- Jay, that is not wise.
- I know it's not wise.

01:04:10.884 --> 01:04:14.913
I know that, but, you know, this
is the only way that people out

01:04:14.914 --> 01:04:19.423
there are gonna give a fuck
about what is going on here.

01:04:19.424 --> 01:04:20.652
It's the only way.

01:04:20.653 --> 01:04:22.394
- I don't believe that.

01:04:22.395 --> 01:04:24.264
- Dude, CBS is willing
to pay $1,000, okay?

01:04:24.265 --> 01:04:25.993
I'll split it with you
if you can get me on a ship.

01:04:25.994 --> 01:04:28.933
I'll split it with you.
That's $500, American dollars.

01:04:28.934 --> 01:04:31.003
That's fucking great money, man.

01:04:31.004 --> 01:04:34.573
- Jay, it's not about money.

01:04:34.574 --> 01:04:37.503
Once you're on the ship,
we cannot protect you.

01:04:37.504 --> 01:04:39.542
The president
won't even allow this.

01:04:39.543 --> 01:04:41.972
- It's CBS.
- It's the biggest network.

01:04:41.973 --> 01:04:43.573
- Yes, and your being

01:04:43.583 --> 01:04:45.843
a famous reporter
getting killed,

01:04:45.853 --> 01:04:48.713
that would seal the fate
for Somali people as terrorists.

01:04:48.714 --> 01:04:51.283
- And I'm not famous.
- Jay, you will be.

01:04:51.284 --> 01:04:53.584
- Abdi, they're not
publishing my words,

01:04:53.594 --> 01:04:55.523
not a single fucking one!

01:04:55.524 --> 01:04:57.792
Nobody gives a flying
fuck about Boyah,

01:04:57.793 --> 01:05:00.393
the struggling fisherman
turned Robin Hood pirate!

01:05:00.394 --> 01:05:02.062
They don't fucking care, man!

01:05:02.063 --> 01:05:05.062
- Do you know Somali clans
used to fight with words

01:05:05.063 --> 01:05:06.802
rather than weapons?

01:05:06.803 --> 01:05:08.432
- I knew that, yes.
- I did a paper on that.

01:05:08.433 --> 01:05:11.843
- So you know our
great freedom fighter,

01:05:11.844 --> 01:05:14.543
the poet warrior Mohammed
Abdullah Hassan, Sayyidka?

01:05:14.544 --> 01:05:16.042
- The English called him
Mad Mullah.

01:05:16.043 --> 01:05:18.082
- Ah, you know of him.

01:05:18.083 --> 01:05:20.982
- Yes, I do, and I also know
that iambic pentameter

01:05:20.983 --> 01:05:23.552
is not gonna solve
this problem, man.

01:05:23.553 --> 01:05:25.852
I got to get on a fucking ship.

01:05:25.853 --> 01:05:27.622
- I will do something better.
- Better?

01:05:27.623 --> 01:05:29.592
What the fuck... what's
better than that?

01:05:29.593 --> 01:05:34.592
- I was working to get you
in a meeting with the Garaad.

01:05:34.593 --> 01:05:35.933
- The Garaad?
- Yes.

01:05:35.934 --> 01:05:37.902
- The godfather of pirates?

01:05:37.903 --> 01:05:41.672
- The man you want to have
crazy sex with his wife.

01:05:41.673 --> 01:05:43.533
- What makes you say that?

01:05:43.543 --> 01:05:46.603
- You don't think all
of Garowe know this?

01:05:46.613 --> 01:05:48.042
- Does Garaad?

01:05:48.043 --> 01:05:50.712
- If he know,
you wouldn't be here.

01:05:50.713 --> 01:05:51.912
- That's comforting.

01:05:51.913 --> 01:05:54.081
- He wants me as a translator,

01:05:54.082 --> 01:05:57.412
so perhaps I trade
for the possibility of him

01:05:57.422 --> 01:05:58.851
and you in a room.

01:05:58.852 --> 01:06:00.082
- Then you're putting
yourself in danger.

01:06:00.092 --> 01:06:01.492
That's... I don't like that.

01:06:01.493 --> 01:06:04.492
- No, no, no, no, mm-mm.

01:06:04.493 --> 01:06:07.662
That's nonsense, Jay.

01:06:07.663 --> 01:06:08.892
- Why you helping me like this?

01:06:08.893 --> 01:06:10.563
Why you doing that?

01:06:10.564 --> 01:06:13.362
- You are my bro.

01:06:13.372 --> 01:06:15.401
I have to help you.

01:06:15.402 --> 01:06:16.501
- Thanks, man.
- Okay?

01:06:16.502 --> 01:06:18.141
- Thank you.

01:06:18.142 --> 01:06:20.941
- You're my bro, Jay.
- Whew, yeah.

01:06:20.942 --> 01:06:24.011
- Don't worry, okay?
- Okay. We're good.

01:06:24.012 --> 01:06:27.643
- Okay. Mm-hmm.
- Have a good night.

01:06:27.653 --> 01:06:31.821
- Edgar Allen Poe, Oscar Wilde,
Herman Melville, H.P. Lovecraft

01:06:31.822 --> 01:06:34.391
all had one thing in common.

01:06:34.392 --> 01:06:38.461
They died broke,
completely penniless,

01:06:38.462 --> 01:06:40.561
so I got to blame
President Farole

01:06:40.562 --> 01:06:43.061
a little bit for not asking
for all his money up front.

01:06:43.062 --> 01:06:45.431
After all, I am a writer,
not an accountant, right?

01:06:45.432 --> 01:06:46.832
Rule number one in life, Asad,

01:06:46.833 --> 01:06:49.631
don't blow all
your money on drugs,

01:06:49.641 --> 01:06:52.902
unless it's definitely gonna
lead to some serious ass

01:06:52.912 --> 01:06:55.741
or a Pulitzer Prize.

01:06:55.742 --> 01:06:59.112
This might not lead to either,
but I'd rather die trying.

01:07:03.182 --> 01:07:06.782
What are you working on?
That me?

01:07:06.792 --> 01:07:09.051
- Yes.

01:07:11.691 --> 01:07:16.161
- That's going up
on the board, buddy.

01:07:16.162 --> 01:07:19.662
Nice. Wish me luck.

01:07:25.811 --> 01:07:32.911
â™ª

01:07:33.881 --> 01:07:35.911
- Good morning, Maryan.

01:07:35.921 --> 01:07:37.611
- Morning, Jay.

01:07:37.621 --> 01:07:42.452
- Could I have 1 kilo
of your best khat?

01:07:42.462 --> 01:07:46.621
- Best?
- Yes.

01:07:46.631 --> 01:07:49.960
- So what is
the special occasion?

01:07:49.961 --> 01:07:55.100
- Um, I'm going to meet
your husband in Bosaso.

01:07:55.101 --> 01:07:59.241
- So this khat is intended
for my husband?

01:07:59.242 --> 01:08:02.870
- Yes.

01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:07.141
- Okay.
- Is that a problem?

01:08:07.151 --> 01:08:09.110
- No.
- No?

01:08:09.111 --> 01:08:11.250
- No.
- Good.

01:08:11.251 --> 01:08:13.250
Great.

01:08:13.251 --> 01:08:18.920
So, uh, any advice on, um,
how I can get on his good side?

01:08:18.921 --> 01:08:21.859
- You're asking me?
- Yeah.

01:08:21.859 --> 01:08:25.099
- Well, I haven't
seen him in months.

01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:28.029
- Oh. Nothing?

01:08:28.029 --> 01:08:30.700
Even a little tidbit,
anything? Like...

01:08:30.701 --> 01:08:34.202
- Compliment his clothes.
- His clothes?

01:08:34.212 --> 01:08:35.841
- Yeah.

01:08:35.841 --> 01:08:39.810
- He's proud of how he dresses.
- Oh.

01:08:39.810 --> 01:08:46.249
Yes, okay, I'll do that.

01:08:46.250 --> 01:08:51.118
Um, what do you think
of my clothes?

01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:55.630
- They are terribly bland.
- Oh, yeah?

01:08:55.631 --> 01:08:57.591
- Yeah.

01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:59.729
- Maybe you could take me
shopping later.

01:08:59.729 --> 01:09:02.830
- Not happening.
- Okay, I got to go.

01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:04.229
Bye.

01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:08.710
- â™ª Oh, Maryan, my sweet

01:09:08.711 --> 01:09:14.009
â™ª If I ruled the world,
every day would be... â™ª

01:09:14.010 --> 01:09:17.678
- What time you got, bro?
- He is one hour late.

01:09:17.679 --> 01:09:20.719
- Mm. Is there any chance
he won't show up?

01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:25.189
- Maybe, but then
we have tomorrow.

01:09:25.189 --> 01:09:26.720
- What if I told you I spent

01:09:26.729 --> 01:09:28.229
the last of my money
on this khat?

01:09:28.229 --> 01:09:30.189
- I'd tell you
Garaad won't eat it.

01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:34.229
Khat, it dies after
one day, useless.

01:09:34.229 --> 01:09:39.098
- Convenient.

01:09:39.099 --> 01:09:44.981
- That's Garaad.

01:09:58.919 --> 01:10:01.988
- Please tell Garaad
that I like his tie.

01:10:01.989 --> 01:10:04.289
- Now, what?
- Yeah.

01:10:04.299 --> 01:10:06.059
Tell him.

01:10:06.069 --> 01:10:09.769
Where did he get it?

01:10:09.770 --> 01:10:12.039
Where... where from?

01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:14.838
Dolce Gabbana.

01:10:14.839 --> 01:10:17.808
- Dolce Gabbana?
- Dolce... you heard that one.

01:10:17.809 --> 01:10:19.608
- Yeah, I heard that.

01:10:19.609 --> 01:10:22.879
Um, what about the suit?

01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:24.278
Dolce Gabbana.

01:10:24.279 --> 01:10:26.079
Knew it!

01:10:26.089 --> 01:10:27.748
- I knew it was Dolce Gabbana.
- He said... no,

01:10:27.749 --> 01:10:29.318
- he say...
- It looks awesome, man.

01:10:29.319 --> 01:10:30.918
- It's not...
- It looks really,

01:10:30.919 --> 01:10:32.687
- really good.
- It's not Dolce Gabbana.

01:10:32.688 --> 01:10:33.918
- It's not Dolce Gabbana?
- No, it's a knockoff.

01:10:33.928 --> 01:10:35.658
- It's a knockoff?
- Mm.

01:10:35.659 --> 01:10:36.789
- Well, that's... I mean,
it looks amazing.

01:10:36.799 --> 01:10:41.028
You would never even know.

01:10:41.029 --> 01:10:43.199
I have a gift for you.

01:10:46.969 --> 01:10:50.968
The best khat money can buy.

01:10:50.978 --> 01:10:54.808
- Wow.
- Yeah, wow.

01:10:56.379 --> 01:11:01.388
- He wants to know where
you buy this khat from.

01:11:01.389 --> 01:11:03.288
- Where?
- Where.

01:11:03.289 --> 01:11:05.289
- In the market in Garowe.

01:11:14.368 --> 01:11:17.028
- He thought so. You got it
from one of his close dealers,

01:11:17.038 --> 01:11:20.967
so now he doesn't want
to waste a bullet in you.

01:11:20.968 --> 01:11:26.778
- Good.
- Thank you for not killing me.

01:11:26.779 --> 01:11:29.377
Uh, don't tell him that.

01:11:29.378 --> 01:11:32.979
So, uh, tell me about yourself,
Garaad. Is this okay?

01:11:32.989 --> 01:11:36.848
Yes, yes.

01:11:44.458 --> 01:11:47.027
- He have more
than 800 hijackers.

01:11:51.338 --> 01:11:54.467
- That is spread
from Bosaso to Eyl.

01:11:54.468 --> 01:11:56.737
- That is a lot.
- Very impressive.

01:11:56.738 --> 01:11:58.178
Very impressive.

01:11:59.978 --> 01:12:02.947
- Now, um, I recently did
an interview with Boyah,

01:12:02.948 --> 01:12:04.207
who's sort of a...

01:12:07.788 --> 01:12:10.187
- He doesn't want to hear
anything about Boyah.

01:12:10.188 --> 01:12:13.017
He said he's a... he's
no one, you know?

01:12:13.027 --> 01:12:14.887
- Say no more. Say no more.

01:12:14.888 --> 01:12:17.088
I understand you're a very
different man from him,

01:12:17.098 --> 01:12:19.027
and I was just wondering if you

01:12:19.028 --> 01:12:20.798
could maybe elaborate on that.

01:12:32.137 --> 01:12:37.407
- With his group,
it's a must to destroy anyone

01:12:37.417 --> 01:12:40.417
and everyone that's
doing illegal fishing.

01:12:40.418 --> 01:12:44.187
- Is it fair to say
that any ship

01:12:44.188 --> 01:12:45.987
that is traveling your waters,

01:12:45.988 --> 01:12:50.087
be it fishing, cargo,

01:12:50.097 --> 01:12:56.467
yacht, that ship is fair game
for your organization to take?

01:13:08.447 --> 01:13:10.447
- It doesn't matter
who they are.

01:13:12.517 --> 01:13:14.316
- They are doing
something wrong.

01:13:14.317 --> 01:13:19.016
They should be punished.

01:13:19.017 --> 01:13:22.886
And we will keep going
till our seas are cleansed

01:13:22.896 --> 01:13:24.995
of illegal fishing vessels.

01:13:24.996 --> 01:13:27.025
- I am jamming.
- Can you come back?

01:13:27.026 --> 01:13:28.795
- I don't know the names
of any of the...

01:13:28.796 --> 01:13:31.537
Jay, Jay.

01:13:35.137 --> 01:13:38.175
- Yo, hey. How's it going?
- Gather your things.

01:13:38.176 --> 01:13:39.275
We're going to Eyl.

01:13:39.276 --> 01:13:42.045
- Eyl?
- Yes.

01:13:42.046 --> 01:13:44.475
- Um, I got to get this Garaad
interview out, buddy.

01:13:44.476 --> 01:13:46.276
- The ship will not
wait for you.

01:13:46.286 --> 01:13:47.915
- A ship?
- Yes.

01:13:47.916 --> 01:13:49.245
There is a German freighter
called Victoria

01:13:49.246 --> 01:13:50.946
being held in the harbor.

01:13:50.956 --> 01:13:52.885
The pirate in charge
is a friend of Colonel Omar.

01:13:52.886 --> 01:13:53.886
- Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:13:53.887 --> 01:13:55.886
- Colonel Omar.

01:13:55.887 --> 01:13:58.226
- You can get me on a ship?
- You want to be on the ship?

01:13:58.227 --> 01:13:59.925
- Yeah.
- Because I had to fight

01:13:59.926 --> 01:14:01.256
both Farole and Colonel

01:14:01.266 --> 01:14:03.226
on this idea for you.

01:14:03.236 --> 01:14:04.995
- Dude, I thought you were
against me getting on a ship.

01:14:04.996 --> 01:14:08.205
- I am.
- Farole tell me to collect $500

01:14:08.206 --> 01:14:10.035
from you for costs
before you leave.

01:14:10.036 --> 01:14:11.435
- Do you have it?
- I don't have that, man.

01:14:11.436 --> 01:14:13.175
- I'm broke.
- Come on, Jay.

01:14:13.176 --> 01:14:14.574
- No, I'm... I'm broke, man.

01:14:14.575 --> 01:14:16.205
I told you that.
I'm sorry, man.

01:14:16.215 --> 01:14:17.905
I didn't... I mean,
I didn't know.

01:14:17.915 --> 01:14:21.245
I didn't want to put you
in that spot, but...

01:14:21.246 --> 01:14:23.546
- Yeah, you spent it
on pirate drugs.

01:14:23.556 --> 01:14:25.355
- Yeah, the pirates don't,

01:14:25.356 --> 01:14:27.485
you know, give an interview
without the drug.

01:14:27.486 --> 01:14:29.986
I mean, I don't know
what you want me to say.

01:14:29.996 --> 01:14:31.287
I'm sorry, man. I don't...

01:14:31.297 --> 01:14:32.625
- You cannot break
Farole words, man.

01:14:32.626 --> 01:14:34.424
He's... he's a very exact man.

01:14:34.425 --> 01:14:36.564
- It'll be okay, man.
- It's not gonna... I'm...

01:14:36.565 --> 01:14:39.394
No one's gonna be in trouble.
I'll figure it out, okay?

01:14:39.395 --> 01:14:42.134
I mean, thank God you can get me
on this fucking ship.

01:14:42.135 --> 01:14:44.466
- It's $1,000 right there.
- It's gonna be hard, man.

01:14:44.476 --> 01:14:46.005
- I'll give you the... I'll
give you the other 500, man.

01:14:46.006 --> 01:14:49.306
- Yeah, meet me downstairs.
- Let's go.

01:14:57.015 --> 01:15:00.385
- Garaad, meet Avril.

01:15:07.026 --> 01:15:14.135
â™ª

01:15:36.085 --> 01:15:39.925
- Jay Bahadur!

01:16:15.494 --> 01:16:18.225
This is where my clan,
Reer Jarfale,

01:16:18.235 --> 01:16:24.433
died fighting for freedom
against the English

01:16:24.434 --> 01:16:27.334
and their colonization.

01:16:27.344 --> 01:16:30.004
We have no monuments here.

01:16:30.014 --> 01:16:31.973
Those bones below those rocks

01:16:31.974 --> 01:16:35.143
will remain anonymous
to outsiders,

01:16:35.144 --> 01:16:37.713
but never to us.

01:16:37.714 --> 01:16:41.414
They are why we are here today.

01:17:03.473 --> 01:17:10.583
â™ª

01:17:47.823 --> 01:17:49.752
- When we get into town,
it's very important

01:17:49.753 --> 01:17:51.652
that you say that you are
with the clan Reer Jarfale.

01:17:51.653 --> 01:17:55.062
- You want me to be
a part of your clan?

01:17:55.063 --> 01:17:56.523
- Yes, you are a son of Levish.

01:17:56.533 --> 01:17:59.391
He's a light-skinned local man.

01:17:59.392 --> 01:18:03.163
- Okay. That makes sense.
- Uh, Reer Jarfale?

01:18:03.173 --> 01:18:05.173
Reer Jarfale.

01:18:05.174 --> 01:18:06.703
- Reer Jarfale.

01:18:06.704 --> 01:18:08.773
- Yes, it is very important
you say this,

01:18:08.774 --> 01:18:13.212
or you're not gonna last long
in this town even with us here.

01:18:13.213 --> 01:18:15.611
- Shit. Okay.

01:18:15.612 --> 01:18:17.642
- You have to say it right.
- What is it again?

01:18:17.652 --> 01:18:21.551
- Reer Jarfale, son of Levish.
- Reer Jarfale, son of Levish.

01:18:21.552 --> 01:18:24.382
- It's two different words.
- Go slowly for me, okay?

01:18:24.392 --> 01:18:25.551
Reer?

01:18:25.552 --> 01:18:27.252
- Jarfale.
- Jarfale.

01:18:27.262 --> 01:18:29.522
- Jarfale.
- Jarfale.

01:18:29.523 --> 01:18:30.762
- No, you're not
saying it right.

01:18:30.763 --> 01:18:33.493
- Reer Jarfale.

01:18:33.503 --> 01:18:35.231
Is that the Victoria?

01:18:35.232 --> 01:18:38.262
- It is.

01:19:03.662 --> 01:19:06.531
- He wants to know your clan.

01:19:06.532 --> 01:19:11.561
- Reer Jarfale.

01:19:11.571 --> 01:19:15.870
- Reer Jarfale?

01:19:15.871 --> 01:19:18.513
Son of Levish.

01:19:22.682 --> 01:19:25.811
- He thinks you're funny.
- Was that the goal?

01:19:25.812 --> 01:19:27.881
- Humor opens doors
in this town.

01:19:27.882 --> 01:19:29.550
- Yeah?

01:19:29.551 --> 01:19:31.850
You got whitey good,
got him real good.

01:19:31.851 --> 01:19:34.851
- That was good?
- Yeah.

01:19:40.291 --> 01:19:44.562
- Mr. Bahadur, Mr. Bahadur,
we are not the criminals.

01:19:44.572 --> 01:19:46.171
- Mm-mm, no.

01:19:46.172 --> 01:19:47.501
- Right, no one here
likes pirates.

01:19:47.502 --> 01:19:49.941
Correct.

01:19:54.382 --> 01:19:57.241
- That ship is
the last one here.

01:19:57.251 --> 01:20:01.350
Everyone in Eyl
will be happy to see them go.

01:20:01.351 --> 01:20:03.181
- Do you think they'll
be leaving soon?

01:20:03.191 --> 01:20:06.220
- That's what we have heard,
so they will leave soon.

01:20:06.221 --> 01:20:08.290
- Okay.
- Mr. Bahadur's book

01:20:08.291 --> 01:20:10.490
is going to shed
new lights on Somalia.

01:20:10.491 --> 01:20:12.830
- Hmm.
- And so the president is very,

01:20:12.831 --> 01:20:14.830
very excited, real excited.

01:20:14.831 --> 01:20:16.400
- Oh? Oh.

01:20:16.401 --> 01:20:20.300
- Have you read any of it,
Colonel Omar?

01:20:20.301 --> 01:20:24.540
- No, actually, but I trust
it will be good, very good.

01:20:24.541 --> 01:20:27.309
Won't it, Mr. Bahadur?

01:20:27.310 --> 01:20:31.310
- Yes. It's exciting,
a very exciting story

01:20:31.311 --> 01:20:34.450
and... and very informative,
lot of different levels.

01:20:34.451 --> 01:20:36.720
It's... it's... very exciting.

01:20:36.721 --> 01:20:38.281
- Mr. Bahadur,

01:20:38.291 --> 01:20:41.960
I'm a spokesperson
for the women of Eyl.

01:20:41.961 --> 01:20:43.820
Our children need education.

01:20:43.830 --> 01:20:46.729
Our schools have been lost,

01:20:46.730 --> 01:20:50.999
never rebuilded
after the tsunami.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:54.930
Will your book talk of this?

01:20:54.940 --> 01:20:56.739
- Yes.
- Good.

01:20:56.740 --> 01:20:59.671
Thank you. Good.

01:21:03.410 --> 01:21:07.580
- What is the name of your book?

01:21:07.581 --> 01:21:09.679
- I'm still working on it,

01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:11.649
- still trying to figure that out.
- Oh.

01:21:11.650 --> 01:21:15.889
- Jay is
perfectionist with his words.

01:21:15.890 --> 01:21:17.789
- Oh. We will see.

01:21:17.790 --> 01:21:20.559
- I am Reer Jarfale,
son of Levish.

01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:26.300
- Reer Jarfale!

01:21:31.940 --> 01:21:34.939
- You might want to
save your battery.

01:21:34.940 --> 01:21:40.310
- Yeah, that's probably
a good idea.

01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:41.910
You think I'll get on?

01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:46.988
- The man in charge of the
operation is named Computer.

01:21:46.989 --> 01:21:49.589
They say he is psychic.

01:21:49.590 --> 01:21:54.490
- Psychic? Is that good or bad?

01:21:56.830 --> 01:22:03.738
- The colonel's contact on
the ship thinks it will happen.

01:22:03.739 --> 01:22:07.369
- All right.

01:22:07.379 --> 01:22:10.939
I am scared, Abdi.

01:22:10.949 --> 01:22:15.049
Shit, man, I mean,
there's no other way.

01:22:15.050 --> 01:22:17.649
I hope you understand that.

01:22:17.650 --> 01:22:21.549
- This is the path
you choose as a man.

01:22:21.559 --> 01:22:27.428
It's not for me to understand.

01:22:27.429 --> 01:22:29.598
I am going to sleep now.

01:22:29.599 --> 01:22:32.399
- All right. Good night, buddy.

01:22:36.598 --> 01:22:39.069
Fucking A.

01:22:58.688 --> 01:23:00.627
- You stay here, man.
- I will do the talking.

01:23:00.628 --> 01:23:05.498
- Okay.
- Don't worry, brother.

01:23:05.499 --> 01:23:07.368
- Okay.
- We'll make this work.

01:23:07.369 --> 01:23:11.099
- Good. Good, thank you.

01:23:37.158 --> 01:23:39.728
- Okay.

01:23:47.638 --> 01:23:49.776
Is he saying no?

01:23:49.777 --> 01:23:52.408
Fuck!

01:23:55.178 --> 01:23:57.078
I'm a journalist,
don't fucking shoot!

01:23:57.088 --> 01:23:59.487
I'm a journalist, it's okay!
Don't fucking shoot me!

01:23:59.488 --> 01:24:01.017
Okay?

01:24:01.018 --> 01:24:02.718
The money is gonna come faster

01:24:02.719 --> 01:24:05.158
if you let me video
the hostages, all right?

01:24:05.159 --> 01:24:07.088
Please don't shoot me.
Please don't shoot.

01:24:07.098 --> 01:24:09.956
Please don't sh...

01:24:09.957 --> 01:24:11.557
If you let me video,

01:24:11.567 --> 01:24:12.826
the world will see
you're serious.

01:24:12.827 --> 01:24:14.866
The world will see you
are serious,

01:24:14.867 --> 01:24:17.138
and the shippers
will settle. Okay?

01:24:18.668 --> 01:24:19.668
- Tell your leader
Computer that.

01:24:19.669 --> 01:24:21.137
Tell him that! Please!

01:24:21.138 --> 01:24:22.837
Please, okay?
It's true. It's true.

01:24:22.838 --> 01:24:24.177
The money's gonna come
so much faster

01:24:24.178 --> 01:24:25.907
if you let me video, okay?

01:24:25.908 --> 01:24:29.477
All right? It's true, I
promise. I promise, okay?

01:24:36.457 --> 01:24:38.718
- I will talk to Computer.
- What you say could make sense.

01:24:38.728 --> 01:24:40.157
- Good.
- Come back tomorrow for answer.

01:24:40.158 --> 01:24:41.758
- Okay. Okay, great.
- Go. Move.

01:24:41.759 --> 01:24:42.998
- Thank you.

01:24:49.967 --> 01:24:51.997
Abdi, did you see that shit?

01:24:52.007 --> 01:24:53.166
- Oh, that was dangerous,
brother.

01:24:53.167 --> 01:24:56.706
You didn't have to come out.

01:24:56.707 --> 01:24:58.637
That was dangerous.

01:24:58.647 --> 01:25:02.476
- Fuck, dude. Oh, fuck.

01:25:02.477 --> 01:25:05.585
Whoo! That's what
I'm talking about, Omar!

01:25:05.586 --> 01:25:06.816
- What was that?

01:25:06.817 --> 01:25:08.186
- What do you mean
what was that?

01:25:08.187 --> 01:25:09.886
- I told you not to
come down there!

01:25:09.887 --> 01:25:11.817
- What was that?
- You weren't gonna get me on.

01:25:11.827 --> 01:25:12.986
- Don't do this, man.
- You weren't gonna get me on.

01:25:12.987 --> 01:25:14.557
You weren't gonna get shit.

01:25:14.558 --> 01:25:16.127
- When are you going
to listen, man?

01:25:16.128 --> 01:25:18.197
- I just got out there,
and I made it happen

01:25:18.198 --> 01:25:19.966
'cause that's what
I'm doing these days, baby!

01:25:19.967 --> 01:25:21.227
- I'm making shit happen!
- You never listen, man!

01:25:21.237 --> 01:25:23.095
Hey, hey, wake up, Mr. Bahadur.

01:25:23.096 --> 01:25:24.165
- Wake up, wake up, wake up.
- What?

01:25:24.166 --> 01:25:25.605
- Wake up right now, man.

01:25:25.606 --> 01:25:26.866
- We're in?
- Right now.

01:25:26.876 --> 01:25:29.676
- We're on. All right.

01:25:37.177 --> 01:25:39.116
It's gone.

01:25:39.117 --> 01:25:43.516
- Next time you follow
my orders, man.

01:25:43.526 --> 01:25:46.825
They thought you were CIA.

01:25:46.826 --> 01:25:48.995
- You fucking serious? CIA?
- Yeah.

01:25:48.996 --> 01:25:50.596
- Me?
- Of course.

01:25:50.597 --> 01:25:53.867
- Fuck! Fuck.

01:25:59.866 --> 01:26:06.976
â™ª

01:26:14.756 --> 01:26:18.284
Abdi, not now!

01:26:18.285 --> 01:26:24.156
- He say he's your father.
- He call my phone.

01:26:24.166 --> 01:26:25.565
- My father?

01:26:25.566 --> 01:26:26.996
- Yes.
- Really?

01:26:26.997 --> 01:26:29.197
He called my phone.

01:26:33.166 --> 01:26:35.335
- Hello? Dad?

01:26:35.336 --> 01:26:37.204
- Jesus, Jay, thank God
you're okay.

01:26:37.205 --> 01:26:39.144
We've been watching this whole
Captain Phillips

01:26:39.145 --> 01:26:41.105
hostage thing on CNN.

01:26:41.115 --> 01:26:42.874
You've got to get
the hell out of there.

01:26:42.875 --> 01:26:44.844
- Dad, I'm fine.
- What are you talking about?

01:26:44.845 --> 01:26:46.645
- Those pirates are crazy.

01:26:46.646 --> 01:26:48.215
They're threatening
to kill Americans.

01:26:48.216 --> 01:26:49.885
- Dad, I'm Canadian.

01:26:49.886 --> 01:26:51.155
I thought at least
you would know that.

01:26:51.156 --> 01:26:52.885
- Not a time for joking, Jay.

01:26:52.886 --> 01:26:54.924
We want you on
the next plane out.

01:26:54.925 --> 01:26:57.624
- Dad, I understand your
concern,

01:26:57.625 --> 01:26:59.224
but it's gonna be okay.

01:26:59.225 --> 01:27:01.094
It's not a big deal.

01:27:01.095 --> 01:27:02.835
- Jay, sweetheart, you need
to come home.

01:27:02.836 --> 01:27:04.135
- Hi, Mom.

01:27:04.136 --> 01:27:06.134
I was just telling Dad I'm fine.

01:27:06.135 --> 01:27:08.804
- But we're watching CNN
right now, and it is not fine.

01:27:08.805 --> 01:27:12.975
- Mom, the media is probably
spinning some bullshit tale.

01:27:12.976 --> 01:27:14.905
I've heard nothing
about it here.

01:27:14.915 --> 01:27:16.914
- It must be the opium.

01:27:16.915 --> 01:27:18.775
He's probably become
one of those child soldiers.

01:27:18.785 --> 01:27:20.614
- You're going to kill
your mother, Jay,

01:27:20.615 --> 01:27:23.754
unless you say
you're going to come home.

01:27:23.755 --> 01:27:27.354
- Okay, but I need money wired.

01:27:27.355 --> 01:27:28.785
- Money?
- See?

01:27:28.795 --> 01:27:30.624
It's the opium, I told you.

01:27:30.625 --> 01:27:32.123
- Yeah, I didn't want to ask
you guys, but, you know,

01:27:32.124 --> 01:27:37.796
I'm really... I don't really
have a choice.

01:27:37.806 --> 01:27:40.066
Somalia's expensive. Who knew?

01:27:45.875 --> 01:27:48.005
- Reports are now three
U.S. Navy ships

01:27:48.015 --> 01:27:50.913
are steaming toward
the Maersk Alabama.

01:27:50.914 --> 01:27:54.244
Taken by pirates...

01:27:54.254 --> 01:27:56.913
- The destroyer,
the USS Bainbridge,

01:27:56.914 --> 01:27:58.914
is on the scene.

01:27:58.924 --> 01:28:00.853
- Apparently Captain Phillips,
the ship's captain,

01:28:00.854 --> 01:28:03.254
has been taken hostage
by the fleeing pirates

01:28:03.255 --> 01:28:04.924
in a covered lifeboat.

01:28:04.925 --> 01:28:10.994
- The pirates have been...

01:28:11.004 --> 01:28:12.933
The hostage standoff

01:28:12.934 --> 01:28:15.304
ended today with the death
of the three pirates

01:28:15.305 --> 01:28:17.773
and the eventual release
of their hostage,

01:28:17.774 --> 01:28:19.243
Captain Richard Phillips.

01:28:19.244 --> 01:28:20.973
- Somali pirates...
- Somali pirates

01:28:20.974 --> 01:28:23.013
throughout the country
reacted angrily,

01:28:23.014 --> 01:28:25.243
saying they will capture
and kill any foreigners

01:28:25.244 --> 01:28:29.113
they find to avenge
their comrades' death.

01:28:29.114 --> 01:28:33.153
- At this time no one is
taking credit for the operation.

01:28:33.154 --> 01:28:37.293
We will get answers soon because
my father is demanding it.

01:28:37.294 --> 01:28:41.463
- Mr. Farole, three pirates have
been killed by the Americans.

01:28:41.464 --> 01:28:43.133
There is going to be revenge,

01:28:43.134 --> 01:28:44.463
and it's too dangerous
for Mr. Bahadur

01:28:44.464 --> 01:28:46.202
to remain here in Garowe.

01:28:46.203 --> 01:28:48.332
- No, it's not.
- I will keep a low profile.

01:28:48.333 --> 01:28:49.903
- Just like you did in Eyl?

01:28:49.904 --> 01:28:51.204
- Eyl was a mistake, okay?

01:28:51.205 --> 01:28:52.874
- You keep saying
it was a mistake.

01:28:52.875 --> 01:28:54.743
- I messed up.
- I'm sorry about that.

01:28:54.744 --> 01:28:56.273
- It was a mistake.
- I was a little high strung.

01:28:56.274 --> 01:28:58.243
- Don't be telling this.
- You're staying here...

01:28:58.244 --> 01:28:59.413
- Okay, I have learned from it,
and I'm all good now.

01:28:59.414 --> 01:29:01.083
I'm not gonna do that again.

01:29:01.084 --> 01:29:02.453
- Mr. Bahadur, I agree
with the Colonel, okay?

01:29:02.454 --> 01:29:05.013
I think we have to
get you out of here.

01:29:05.023 --> 01:29:08.452
We do not need any harm coming
to you. Do you understand that?

01:29:08.453 --> 01:29:10.152
- I get that.
- Do you understand that?

01:29:10.153 --> 01:29:13.062
- Mr. Farole,
I understand that, okay?

01:29:13.063 --> 01:29:14.862
I understand your concern
for my safety.

01:29:14.863 --> 01:29:16.363
- It doesn't look
like you understand.

01:29:16.364 --> 01:29:17.794
- I understand the concern
for my safety,

01:29:17.804 --> 01:29:19.263
but you need somebody here.

01:29:19.264 --> 01:29:21.403
I need to find out
who's behind this, okay?

01:29:21.404 --> 01:29:23.133
I need to interview them.

01:29:23.134 --> 01:29:24.803
- No, no, Mr....
- So I can interview them.

01:29:24.804 --> 01:29:26.473
- That's why you brought me here!
- No, no.

01:29:26.474 --> 01:29:28.043
- That's why you've been
protecting me the whole time!

01:29:28.044 --> 01:29:31.342
- People are dying, okay?
- Madness.

01:29:31.343 --> 01:29:33.512
- Khat's eating his brain.
- Khat?

01:29:33.513 --> 01:29:35.343
- Khat is not eating
my fucking brain.

01:29:35.353 --> 01:29:37.152
- It is. I can hear that.
- There's no one else here

01:29:37.153 --> 01:29:39.122
- from the Western media.
- Mr. Bahadur, calm down!

01:29:39.123 --> 01:29:41.084
- Your father needs
somebody on his side!

01:29:41.094 --> 01:29:42.992
- Mr. Bahadur, this... this...
- He needs somebody on his side!

01:29:42.993 --> 01:29:44.322
All of fucking Somalia
needs somebody on their side!

01:29:44.323 --> 01:29:46.522
- Mr. Bahadur,
this is not negotiable.

01:29:46.523 --> 01:29:52.362
I cannot risk your blood
on my hands, okay?

01:29:52.363 --> 01:29:58.102
- Okay.
- Abdi, come in!

01:29:58.103 --> 01:29:59.442
Can you please make arrangements

01:29:59.443 --> 01:30:02.272
for Mr. Bahadur
to fly home tomorrow?

01:30:02.273 --> 01:30:04.273
Yes, Mr. Farole.

01:30:04.283 --> 01:30:06.942
- And make sure
his account are settled.

01:30:06.943 --> 01:30:09.783
Accounts settled, okay.

01:30:14.323 --> 01:30:17.052
- Please tell me my parents
sent me that money.

01:30:17.053 --> 01:30:19.461
- Yes.
- It's already in the bank.

01:30:19.462 --> 01:30:21.261
- Really?
- Yes.

01:30:21.262 --> 01:30:23.831
- That is the best news,
the fucking best!

01:30:23.832 --> 01:30:26.231
Mm, Mom and Dad, I love you.

01:30:26.232 --> 01:30:28.131
You think we could set up
a final meeting with Boyah?

01:30:28.132 --> 01:30:30.301
- I already have, bro.
- You did?

01:30:30.302 --> 01:30:31.872
- Yes, we're actually
running late.

01:30:31.873 --> 01:30:36.173
- Abdi! Abdi!

01:30:36.174 --> 01:30:37.542
Where's our rig?

01:30:37.543 --> 01:30:41.511
- For once, you're local.

01:30:41.512 --> 01:30:43.111
Here.

01:30:43.112 --> 01:30:45.512
- Is this... uh,
is this... is this necessary?

01:30:45.522 --> 01:30:51.152
- Do you see me wearing
my Obama hat?

01:31:13.513 --> 01:31:15.411
- What are they saying?
- They think we're

01:31:15.412 --> 01:31:17.150
- from the government.
- We have a meeting with Boyah,

01:31:17.151 --> 01:31:18.950
a meeting, a meeting.

01:31:18.951 --> 01:31:21.221
- Tell them that... tell them
that I have a gift

01:31:21.222 --> 01:31:22.851
in my bag for Boyah.

01:31:22.852 --> 01:31:24.521
If they let me open it,
I can show them.

01:31:24.522 --> 01:31:25.921
- Jay, no joking right now.
- I'm not fucking joking.

01:31:25.922 --> 01:31:27.361
It's a fucking gift for Boyah.

01:31:27.362 --> 01:31:31.461
Show them this.

01:31:31.462 --> 01:31:33.300
- It's all cool. It's all cool.

01:31:33.301 --> 01:31:35.561
It's all cool.

01:31:35.571 --> 01:31:38.871
Blue Jays. Blue Jays.

01:31:49.283 --> 01:31:51.483
Canned tuna-

01:31:53.351 --> 01:31:55.281
- Was the only export
from the country.

01:31:55.291 --> 01:32:00.560
And today it's very sad.

01:32:00.561 --> 01:32:06.100
All it's good for is a target
the size of a man's heart.

01:32:06.101 --> 01:32:11.931
- Is that what you aim for?

01:32:11.941 --> 01:32:17.210
- If necessary.
- You're an amazing shot.

01:32:17.211 --> 01:32:22.580
No. No, no, no. No.

01:32:22.581 --> 01:32:26.151
Sorry, I... I will totally suck.
I'm terrible.

01:32:26.152 --> 01:32:28.150
I'm not even...

01:32:28.151 --> 01:32:31.350
I'm shooting, okay.

01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:33.059
He say don't aim

01:32:33.060 --> 01:32:34.459
as your enemy.

01:32:34.460 --> 01:32:36.160
You shoot for
your lover's heart.

01:32:36.161 --> 01:32:38.191
- That's super fucked up.

01:32:38.201 --> 01:32:40.600
I don't know what that means,
but all right.

01:32:40.601 --> 01:32:42.601
All right.

01:32:56.180 --> 01:32:57.710
- Hey!

01:32:57.720 --> 01:33:03.491
- Yeah!

01:33:03.492 --> 01:33:05.291
- Hey!
- Hey!

01:33:07.990 --> 01:33:10.159
- He wants to know
who is the lucky girl.

01:33:10.160 --> 01:33:12.159
- That is an ex-girlfriend

01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:15.970
who's getting married to
someone else.

01:33:22.070 --> 01:33:25.109
- He say it's
a waste of bullets.

01:33:25.110 --> 01:33:28.540
- You think? I mean,
I nailed that shit. Hit it.

01:33:37.351 --> 01:33:40.359
- There is no joy
in your victory,

01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:45.559
only revenge.

01:33:50.630 --> 01:33:53.099
- He say he know why you come.

01:33:53.100 --> 01:33:55.669
You want to know about
the American ship

01:33:55.670 --> 01:33:57.339
that have been attacked,

01:33:57.340 --> 01:33:59.609
but he want to tell you
he didn't do it.

01:33:59.610 --> 01:34:01.510
- Does he know who did?

01:34:06.449 --> 01:34:09.548
No.

01:34:09.549 --> 01:34:11.550
- But the easiest way
to find out...

01:34:14.060 --> 01:34:18.030
...Is to follow the heart.
Maryan will know.

01:34:22.169 --> 01:34:29.269
â™ª

01:34:49.630 --> 01:34:52.289
Is Maryan here?

01:34:52.299 --> 01:34:55.799
- She's not here today?

01:35:16.518 --> 01:35:23.629
â™ª

01:35:44.708 --> 01:35:47.418
- You find her?
- No.

01:35:49.418 --> 01:35:52.717
- Boyah has been arrested.

01:35:52.718 --> 01:35:54.387
- What?

01:35:54.388 --> 01:35:55.557
- The president is feeling
the pressure

01:35:55.558 --> 01:35:57.688
over the American hijacking.

01:35:57.698 --> 01:35:59.798
- Boyah didn't do anything.

01:35:59.799 --> 01:36:02.498
- He's done enough.

01:36:02.499 --> 01:36:05.168
- Shit.

01:36:10.438 --> 01:36:13.176
- Jay?

01:36:13.177 --> 01:36:18.707
Don't worry. Your words
will reach the Western people.

01:36:18.717 --> 01:36:21.378
I know.

01:36:44.368 --> 01:36:49.276
- Now I see why you stare
out here in the morning.

01:36:49.277 --> 01:36:52.507
It's a different view.

01:36:52.517 --> 01:36:54.416
- This is real?

01:36:54.417 --> 01:36:57.747
- What?
- You in my bedroom?

01:36:57.757 --> 01:37:00.656
- Yeah.

01:37:00.657 --> 01:37:02.757
- Wow.

01:37:05.397 --> 01:37:11.667
- I needed to talk to you.

01:37:11.668 --> 01:37:13.367
What's all this?

01:37:13.368 --> 01:37:15.766
- These are the plot points
to my book.

01:37:15.767 --> 01:37:21.276
Um, I like to write everything
down, keep it all organized.

01:37:21.277 --> 01:37:23.306
- You're a crazy man

01:37:23.307 --> 01:37:25.376
to come here to write,
you know that?

01:37:25.377 --> 01:37:28.376
- I'm not the one who snuck
in past security into my room.

01:37:28.386 --> 01:37:30.885
- Well, I've come to warn you.

01:37:30.886 --> 01:37:34.586
My husband is responsible for
the attacks on the Americans.

01:37:34.587 --> 01:37:36.986
- Garaad?
- And he plans

01:37:36.987 --> 01:37:39.826
on retaliating
against the Americans

01:37:39.827 --> 01:37:42.296
for killing his crew.

01:37:42.297 --> 01:37:48.436
If you stay here,
you will most certainly die.

01:37:48.437 --> 01:37:53.576
- Um, does he know I'm Canadian?

01:37:54.906 --> 01:37:57.476
- I don't think
that will matter much.

01:38:04.716 --> 01:38:08.916
- This card bears my name.
- What does it say?

01:38:08.926 --> 01:38:13.495
- You don't read English?
- Not so well.

01:38:13.496 --> 01:38:18.295
- That card says that, um,

01:38:18.296 --> 01:38:21.765
you're the hottest drug dealer
in the world.

01:38:21.766 --> 01:38:24.606
- Is that what it says?

01:38:24.607 --> 01:38:26.005
- Yes.

01:38:26.006 --> 01:38:28.836
- I like that.

01:38:28.846 --> 01:38:31.976
Well...

01:38:37.916 --> 01:38:39.815
this is my number.

01:38:39.816 --> 01:38:43.484
Don't text me. I like voices.

01:38:43.485 --> 01:38:47.354
- Me too.
- And please, if you can,

01:38:47.355 --> 01:38:49.795
send me movies or magazines

01:38:49.796 --> 01:38:51.765
that shows my people

01:38:51.766 --> 01:38:54.635
for who they really are.

01:38:54.636 --> 01:38:57.767
I'm tired of watching fools
pretending they are Somalis

01:38:57.777 --> 01:39:00.405
in "Black Hawk Down."

01:39:00.406 --> 01:39:03.005
- Deal.
- Okay.

01:39:06.015 --> 01:39:13.315
â™ª

01:39:29.905 --> 01:39:32.104
- The next morning Garaad
claimed credit for the attack

01:39:32.105 --> 01:39:33.475
on the Maersk Alabama

01:39:33.476 --> 01:39:35.405
and said,

01:39:35.406 --> 01:39:37.503
"I vow to attack any ship
flying an American flag

01:39:37.504 --> 01:39:41.375
for the retaliation of the
brutal killing of our friends."

01:39:41.385 --> 01:39:43.984
Within hours he delivered
on his words

01:39:43.985 --> 01:39:45.984
by attacking the
humanitarian relief vessel,

01:39:45.985 --> 01:39:50.954
the MV Liberty's Son,
with rocket-propelled grenades.

01:39:50.955 --> 01:39:53.454
My time to leave had come.

01:39:53.455 --> 01:39:55.393
Yo!

01:39:55.394 --> 01:40:00.393
Hey,

01:40:00.394 --> 01:40:03.734
Yeah!

01:40:03.735 --> 01:40:05.804
- I got her number.

01:40:05.805 --> 01:40:09.075
Yeah!

01:40:09.076 --> 01:40:14.574
Colonel, thank you
for your protection.

01:40:14.584 --> 01:40:17.544
- I will do anything
for Reer Jarfale, son of Levish.

01:40:23.124 --> 01:40:25.784
All right.

01:40:35.704 --> 01:40:42.804
â™ª

01:41:17.803 --> 01:41:19.443
- Don't worry, man.

01:41:19.444 --> 01:41:21.714
I will look for you
on the bestseller list.

01:41:21.715 --> 01:41:23.075
I am sure of it.

01:41:23.085 --> 01:41:25.144
- Mm.

01:41:25.154 --> 01:41:28.052
What, is this a offensive
gesture to Somalis?

01:41:28.053 --> 01:41:30.452
- No, it's not offensive.

01:41:30.453 --> 01:41:33.083
Even this is not offensive,
you see?

01:41:33.093 --> 01:41:35.592
- What?

01:41:35.593 --> 01:41:36.992
- I was messing
with you that day.

01:41:36.993 --> 01:41:38.862
- Six months?
- You didn't tell me?

01:41:38.863 --> 01:41:40.732
- The look on your face.

01:41:40.733 --> 01:41:44.764
- I'm doing this forever.
- What this thing mean?

01:41:44.774 --> 01:41:48.472
- This means hope.
- Hope?

01:41:48.473 --> 01:41:49.772
- Yes.

01:41:49.773 --> 01:41:52.172
- Okay, I will spread
that message.

01:41:52.173 --> 01:41:55.574
- Please do.
- Yes. Take care

01:42:07.222 --> 01:42:11.223
- They say in Somalia,
every man is his own sultan.

01:42:11.233 --> 01:42:16.533
Then in my mind, Abdi was
a glorious kind among sultans.

01:42:25.512 --> 01:42:28.911
Upon landing back in the cell
zone known as Toronto, Canada,

01:42:28.912 --> 01:42:32.082
I got 234 unopened
text messages.

01:42:32.083 --> 01:42:34.553
165 were from news services

01:42:34.554 --> 01:42:37.052
offering
to buy my Garaad interview.

01:42:37.053 --> 01:42:40.892
Eight were from publishers
wanting to buy my book rights,

01:42:40.893 --> 01:42:44.892
and four of them
were from Tracy.

01:42:49.302 --> 01:42:50.931
I decided if she really
wanted to know

01:42:50.932 --> 01:42:53.671
what was going on in my life,

01:42:53.672 --> 01:42:56.671
she could read about it.

01:42:56.672 --> 01:42:58.903
- Excuse me.
- Can I see your passport?

01:42:58.913 --> 01:43:01.572
- Passport?

01:43:06.612 --> 01:43:09.683
- Follow me, please.

01:43:19.861 --> 01:43:22.191
- Hello, Mr. Bahadur.
- Hello.

01:43:22.201 --> 01:43:24.662
- My name's Agent Brice.
- I'm with CSIS.

01:43:24.672 --> 01:43:29.301
- Okay. Uh, is... am I in
some sort of trouble?

01:43:29.302 --> 01:43:31.271
- Quite the opposite.

01:43:31.272 --> 01:43:34.011
We're very anxious to learn
if you could give us any insight

01:43:34.012 --> 01:43:38.741
that you may have gained
while in Somalia.

01:43:38.751 --> 01:43:41.680
- Wait, you want me
to give you insight?

01:43:41.681 --> 01:43:44.921
- Look, uh, both the U.S.
- and the Canadian intelligence

01:43:44.922 --> 01:43:49.152
are basically flying blind
in the region,

01:43:49.162 --> 01:43:52.591
so we could use some help.

01:43:52.592 --> 01:43:54.731
- Oh, my God.

01:43:54.732 --> 01:43:58.061
Wow. Okay.

01:43:58.071 --> 01:44:01.600
Uh, this... my parents are, uh,
doing the circling thing.

01:44:01.601 --> 01:44:04.000
- Right, okay. All right,
well, uh, tell you what.

01:44:04.001 --> 01:44:08.211
Why don't you give me a call
when you're settled in?

01:44:12.211 --> 01:44:16.150
- Toronto had stayed perfectly
intact despite my absence.

01:44:16.151 --> 01:44:18.150
I couldn't vouch for
the napkin patterns

01:44:18.151 --> 01:44:21.091
inside each home we drove past,

01:44:21.092 --> 01:44:23.191
but I had to guess
my painstaking research

01:44:23.192 --> 01:44:25.291
did little to alter
the landscape.

01:44:29.961 --> 01:44:31.700
- We don't want to upset you.

01:44:31.701 --> 01:44:33.229
We did not know
how to tell you this.

01:44:33.230 --> 01:44:35.969
- Jared's been living
in the basement.

01:44:35.970 --> 01:44:37.800
- What?

01:44:37.801 --> 01:44:41.040
- Well, you've been gone
for six months, sweetheart.

01:44:41.041 --> 01:44:42.910
So, you know, um, he's sleeping

01:44:42.911 --> 01:44:44.810
because he has exams
in the morning,

01:44:44.811 --> 01:44:46.810
so it's best that you enter
through the front door.

01:44:46.811 --> 01:44:48.380
- Can I still use the shower,

01:44:48.381 --> 01:44:50.420
or are the pipes
gonna wake him too?

01:44:50.421 --> 01:44:55.690
- I think tonight we can
make an exception.

01:44:55.691 --> 01:44:58.360
Fuck Harvard!

01:44:58.361 --> 01:45:02.090
- Oh, my God!

01:45:04.201 --> 01:45:08.300
- Fuck Harvard!

01:45:08.301 --> 01:45:09.930
- I've never heard
you swear before.

01:45:09.940 --> 01:45:11.969
- Yeah, well, it's true.
- Fuck 'em.

01:45:11.970 --> 01:45:14.069
My Jay beat all the odds,

01:45:14.070 --> 01:45:15.409
and you're gonna
win the Pulitzer

01:45:15.410 --> 01:45:18.279
from writing it in our basement.

01:45:18.280 --> 01:45:22.010
- To Jay and his fucking
basement Pulitzer!

01:45:22.020 --> 01:45:23.979
- Yeah!

01:45:23.980 --> 01:45:26.989
- Who's idea
was "Fuck Harvard?"

01:45:26.990 --> 01:45:30.290
- Bahadur, you better tell me
you got laid at least

01:45:30.291 --> 01:45:33.060
once over there, or I'm leaving.

01:45:33.061 --> 01:45:35.890
On second thought,
don't tell me.

01:45:35.900 --> 01:45:37.260
Booze is too good to leave.

01:45:39.030 --> 01:45:43.069
- You guys want to see
something really cool?

01:45:43.070 --> 01:45:45.169
- Wow.

01:45:45.170 --> 01:45:49.708
You should see
what he does with the bottle.

01:45:49.709 --> 01:45:54.079
- Would I like mine
so... hey, man.

01:45:54.080 --> 01:45:55.879
- What are you mumbling about?

01:45:55.880 --> 01:45:58.219
- Well, I'm just thinking
aloud, you know?

01:45:58.220 --> 01:46:01.989
- Okay. I like that.
- I like that.

01:46:01.990 --> 01:46:06.459
- So what's next, Bahadur?
- Next?

01:46:06.460 --> 01:46:10.299
- What's gonna keep you from
spending all your nights

01:46:10.300 --> 01:46:13.468
in the shadow of those guys?

01:46:13.469 --> 01:46:16.998
- Well, I got a ton of work
to do on the book.

01:46:16.999 --> 01:46:19.269
- After the book?
- After?

01:46:19.270 --> 01:46:22.339
- Yeah.

01:46:22.340 --> 01:46:26.178
- Take a look at that.

01:46:26.179 --> 01:46:30.248
- 70-year-old men don't get
handed fucking business cards

01:46:30.249 --> 01:46:33.079
for a reason unless
it's a last rites priest.

01:46:33.089 --> 01:46:34.448
What's it say?

01:46:34.449 --> 01:46:38.858
- Agent T. Brice, CSIS.
- CSIS?

01:46:38.859 --> 01:46:40.788
- Yeah.
- They talked to you?

01:46:40.789 --> 01:46:46.160
- Yes, they did.
- What'd they say?

01:46:46.170 --> 01:46:50.198
- They were anxious to listen
to what I learned over there.

01:46:50.199 --> 01:46:52.099
- Anxious, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

01:46:52.109 --> 01:46:54.268
- Anxious?
- Mm-hmm.

01:46:54.269 --> 01:47:00.248
- Could bring an opportunity.
- That's what I think.

01:47:00.249 --> 01:47:02.447
- Oh.
- Hmm?

01:47:02.448 --> 01:47:05.778
- Christ, you haven't smoked
this fucker yet?

01:47:05.788 --> 01:47:07.418
- Not yet.
- I've been tempted though.

01:47:07.419 --> 01:47:10.419
- You're hopeless.
- Give me the fucking thing.

01:47:14.959 --> 01:47:17.028
- That's Somali?
- Yes.

01:47:17.029 --> 01:47:20.868
- What does it mean?
- "Tonight, we drink."

01:47:20.869 --> 01:47:22.368
- Oh, that's good to hear.

01:47:22.369 --> 01:47:25.237
I thought you were gonna say,
"Tonight we fuck."

01:47:25.238 --> 01:47:32.339
â™ª

01:47:37.849 --> 01:47:39.347
- Please have a seat.

01:47:39.348 --> 01:47:42.018
- Thank you.

01:47:46.888 --> 01:47:51.558
- State your name and work
position for the committee.

01:47:51.568 --> 01:47:53.259
- Sure.

01:47:53.269 --> 01:47:55.198
My name is Jay Bahadur.

01:47:55.199 --> 01:47:56.529
I'm a Canadian citizen

01:47:56.539 --> 01:47:58.199
currently living
in Nairobi, Kenya.

01:47:58.209 --> 01:47:59.467
I'm running
"The Somalia Report,"

01:47:59.468 --> 01:48:01.367
which is the largest and in fact

01:48:01.368 --> 01:48:04.507
the only English-language
news site devoted to Somalia.

01:48:04.508 --> 01:48:06.338
- Mr. Bahadur, you're
considered

01:48:06.348 --> 01:48:07.907
one of the foremost experts

01:48:07.908 --> 01:48:12.178
on Somali piracy, are you not?

01:48:12.188 --> 01:48:15.216
- I have some knowledge, sir.
- Some knowledge

01:48:15.217 --> 01:48:17.116
would be an understatement.

01:48:17.117 --> 01:48:19.186
Your book on piracy's currently
on "The New York Times'"

01:48:19.187 --> 01:48:21.526
bestseller list, is it not?

01:48:21.527 --> 01:48:24.197
- Yes, that's true, sir.
- In your opinion,

01:48:24.198 --> 01:48:26.058
what's the most
effective way for us

01:48:26.068 --> 01:48:28.929
to combat
this current piracy trend

01:48:28.939 --> 01:48:32.638
and make shipping lanes
safe for our vessels?

01:48:32.639 --> 01:48:36.306
- Well, that's a very
general question, sir.

01:48:36.307 --> 01:48:42.546
- Well, your best answer's
all we ask, sir.

01:48:42.547 --> 01:48:45.146
- Okay.

01:48:45.147 --> 01:48:47.017
I know there's a lot
of collective knowledge

01:48:47.018 --> 01:48:49.148
in this room, so I apologize
if what I'm about to say

01:48:49.158 --> 01:48:51.187
is old news to some of you.

01:48:51.188 --> 01:48:54.156
I did a paper on the subject
my freshman year at university,

01:48:54.157 --> 01:48:55.956
and it just stuck with me.

01:48:55.957 --> 01:48:58.896
- A school paper?

01:48:58.897 --> 01:49:00.626
- Yes.
- Are we gonna hear

01:49:00.627 --> 01:49:03.496
your grade too?

01:49:03.497 --> 01:49:06.907
- No, sir, that is classified.

01:49:06.908 --> 01:49:11.335
Um, in 2002 Somaliland
held an election

01:49:11.336 --> 01:49:15.176
where the minority clan won the
presidential office by 80 votes,

01:49:15.177 --> 01:49:19.177
and the transition of power
was completely peaceful,

01:49:19.187 --> 01:49:22.086
no violence, not one shot fired.

01:49:22.087 --> 01:49:24.056
That doesn't happen
anywhere in Africa.

01:49:24.057 --> 01:49:26.386
That doesn't even happen here.

01:49:26.387 --> 01:49:30.355
Anyway, it caught my eye
and made me start

01:49:30.356 --> 01:49:31.956
to fall in love with Somalia

01:49:31.966 --> 01:49:33.425
and ultimately made me

01:49:33.426 --> 01:49:35.926
go there to find out
what made them different.

01:49:35.936 --> 01:49:37.566
After spending
my last five years

01:49:37.567 --> 01:49:40.507
immersed in their
country's struggles,

01:49:40.508 --> 01:49:44.977
they don't need your
warships off their coast.

01:49:44.978 --> 01:49:48.145
What they need is to be
recognized by all of you

01:49:48.146 --> 01:49:53.515
for the incredibly complex but
honorable culture that they are.

01:49:53.516 --> 01:49:56.215
A fledgling democracy doesn't
make headlines like pirates do.

01:49:56.216 --> 01:49:57.715
You guys wouldn't be
sitting here talking to me

01:49:57.716 --> 01:49:59.655
if I wrote a book
on a fledgling democracy.

01:49:59.656 --> 01:50:01.385
Hell, I couldn't even
afford this suit

01:50:01.386 --> 01:50:05.196
if I wrote a book
on a fledgling democracy.

01:50:05.197 --> 01:50:08.465
All I'm asking is that you guys
start to look at Somalia

01:50:08.466 --> 01:50:10.265
in a different way,

01:50:10.266 --> 01:50:13.235
not so much as them versus us,

01:50:13.236 --> 01:50:17.476
but rather look at Somalia as us

01:50:17.477 --> 01:50:20.307
when we were young.

01:50:55.677 --> 01:51:01.315
- â™ª I've never seen a diamond
in the flesh â™ª

01:51:01.316 --> 01:51:06.684
â™ª I cut my teeth on wedding
rings in the movies â™ª

01:51:06.685 --> 01:51:12.255
â™ª And I'm not proud of my
address â™ª

01:51:12.265 --> 01:51:14.724
â™ª In the torn up town

01:51:14.725 --> 01:51:17.465
â™ª No post code envy

01:51:17.466 --> 01:51:19.396
â™ª But every song's like
gold teeth â™ª

01:51:19.406 --> 01:51:21.534
â™ª Grey Goose, trippin'
in the bathroom â™ª

01:51:21.535 --> 01:51:24.204
â™ª Bloodstains, ball gowns,
trashin' the hotel room â™ª

01:51:24.205 --> 01:51:29.145
â™ª We don't care, we're driving
Cadillacs in our dreams â™ª

01:51:29.146 --> 01:51:31.115
â™ª But everybody's like Cristal,
Maybach â™ª

01:51:31.116 --> 01:51:33.145
â™ª Diamonds on your timepiece

01:51:33.146 --> 01:51:35.284
â™ª Jet planes, islands, tigers
on a gold leash â™ª

01:51:35.285 --> 01:51:39.653
â™ª We don't care, we're not
caught up in your love affair â™ª

01:51:39.654 --> 01:51:43.585
â™ª And we'll never be royals
- â™ª Royals

01:51:43.595 --> 01:51:45.755
â™ª It don't run in our blood

01:51:45.765 --> 01:51:48.525
â™ª That kind of luck
just ain't for us â™ª

01:51:48.535 --> 01:51:50.734
â™ª We crave a different
kind of buzz â™ª

01:51:50.735 --> 01:51:54.564
â™ª And let me be your ruler
- â™ª Ruler

01:51:54.565 --> 01:51:56.765
â™ª You can call me Queen B

01:51:56.775 --> 01:52:01.143
- â™ª And baby I'll rule I'll
rule, I'll rule, I'll rule â™ª

01:52:01.144 --> 01:52:05.214
- â™ª Let me live that fantasy

01:52:05.215 --> 01:52:07.416
â™ª Yeah

01:52:07.846 --> 01:52:10.084
â™ª Hey

01:52:10.085 --> 01:52:12.784
â™ª Hey, yeah

01:52:12.785 --> 01:52:18.554
â™ª My friends and I we've
cracked the code â™ª

01:52:18.564 --> 01:52:24.133
â™ª We count our dollars on
the train to the party â™ª

01:52:24.134 --> 01:52:29.564
â™ª And everyone who knows us
knows â™ª

01:52:29.574 --> 01:52:32.235
â™ª That we're
fine with this â™ª

01:52:32.245 --> 01:52:34.744
â™ª We didn't come from money

01:52:34.745 --> 01:52:36.673
â™ª But every song's like
gold teeth â™ª

01:52:36.674 --> 01:52:38.813
â™ª Grey Goose, trippin'
in the bathroom â™ª

01:52:38.814 --> 01:52:41.484
â™ª Bloodstains, ball gowns,
trashin' the hotel room â™ª

01:52:41.485 --> 01:52:46.414
â™ª We don't care, we're driving
Cadillacs in our dreams â™ª

01:52:46.424 --> 01:52:48.383
â™ª But everybody's like Cristal,
Maybach â™ª

01:52:48.384 --> 01:52:50.423
â™ª Diamonds on your timepiece

â™ª Jet planes, islands, tigers

01:52:52.564 --> 01:52:57.133
â™ª We don't care, we're not

01:52:57.134 --> 01:53:00.863
â™ª And we'll never be royals
- â™ª Royals

01:53:00.864 --> 01:53:03.233
â™ª It don't run in our blood

â™ª We crave a different

01:53:08.204 --> 01:53:11.843
