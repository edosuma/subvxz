02:46.905 --> 02:47.863
This is the place.

03:06.664 --> 03:08.492
It's okay.

03:08.536 --> 03:11.234
It's actually not that bad.

03:11.278 --> 03:12.757
The way your mother
was talking,

03:12.801 --> 03:15.412
I was expecting some
kind of murder house.

03:15.456 --> 03:18.589
Yeah, you shouldn't pay
too much attention to my mom.

03:18.633 --> 03:21.418
She and Uncle Alex
didn't exactly get along.

03:35.693 --> 03:36.433
Ah.

03:41.482 --> 03:44.267
Smells rather musty.

03:44.311 --> 03:46.878
Well, it's either this
or 2000 bucks a month

03:46.922 --> 03:48.315
for the apartment.

03:52.493 --> 03:54.103
I love it.

03:54.146 --> 03:55.235
Right.

04:01.980 --> 04:03.678
Is that him?

04:03.721 --> 04:05.723
Yeah, that's
Uncle Alexander.

04:07.290 --> 04:08.770
It still feels a bit weird,

04:08.813 --> 04:10.859
staying in
a dead man's house.

04:10.902 --> 04:13.253
Well, it's just a house,
Diane.

04:18.432 --> 04:19.998
Hey, hey, hey,
let me get that.

04:21.565 --> 04:23.524
Come on. I'm three months pregnant,

04:23.567 --> 04:26.178
Mitch, I'm not an invalid. I know. I just... Will you...

04:26.222 --> 04:28.050
Will you take it easy?

04:28.093 --> 04:29.269
For me?

04:40.410 --> 04:41.629
Try the faucet.

04:43.544 --> 04:45.589
Great. Try under the counter.

04:49.201 --> 04:51.465
I think the fuses
are in the basement.

04:51.508 --> 04:53.205
I'll go take a look.

05:45.519 --> 05:47.042
Hey, Diane.

05:47.085 --> 05:48.043
Come see what I found.

06:39.660 --> 06:41.401
Diane!

06:41.444 --> 06:43.446
Ooh! Ow!

06:45.143 --> 06:46.754
Shit, Diane.

06:49.496 --> 06:51.411
Oh. Ow!

06:55.066 --> 06:56.067
Shit.

07:32.756 --> 07:35.498
Hey, Mom. How is she?

07:35.542 --> 07:38.849
She's fine.
Uh, we saw Dr. Fielding.

07:38.893 --> 07:40.634
Everything's fine,
the baby's fine.

07:40.677 --> 07:42.549
You should be more careful.

07:42.592 --> 07:44.028
Imagine letting her carry

07:44.072 --> 07:46.422
boxes in from the car.

07:46.466 --> 07:48.032
I told you,
nothing good would come

07:48.076 --> 07:49.904
from you staying
in that house.

07:49.947 --> 07:51.732
Please, Mom,
don't start this again.

07:51.775 --> 07:53.516
Well, think of
your poor sister.

07:53.560 --> 07:55.910
But, Mom, I don't get

07:55.953 --> 07:58.086
how it affects Karen
if I'm staying here.

07:58.129 --> 08:00.175
She doesn't know
what day of the week it is.

08:00.218 --> 08:02.090
Don't say that. Well, it's true.

08:02.133 --> 08:03.961
When's the last
time you saw her?

08:04.005 --> 08:06.355
I don't know,
it's been a while.

08:06.398 --> 08:08.836
A while? Maybe a year, I guess.

08:08.879 --> 08:11.229
Mitch Walker, how could you?

08:11.273 --> 08:12.883
Abandoning your own sister.

08:12.927 --> 08:14.450
When did you last visit?

08:14.494 --> 08:16.278
It's been hard
for me to get out there

08:16.321 --> 08:18.454
since your father passed.

08:18.498 --> 08:19.716
You have
a perfectly good car.

08:19.760 --> 08:21.152
Yeah, when it works.

08:21.196 --> 08:22.937
Listen, Mom, you know things

08:22.980 --> 08:25.156
haven't been great financially
for me and Diane.

08:25.200 --> 08:27.681
Staying at the house
is really gonna help us out.

08:27.724 --> 08:29.421
The rent in town
was crippling us.

08:29.465 --> 08:32.990
It's no place for my grandchild
to be born and raised.

08:33.034 --> 08:35.340
The good Lord has seen fit
for you and Diane

08:35.384 --> 08:36.645
to be blessed
with this child.

08:36.690 --> 08:37.908
Where was he a year ago?

08:37.952 --> 08:39.909
There's evil in that house,

08:39.953 --> 08:41.695
you mark my words. Jesus, Mom!

08:41.738 --> 08:43.260
What did you say?

08:46.221 --> 08:47.918
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I...

08:47.962 --> 08:50.138
It's just the house.

08:50.181 --> 08:52.357
Okay,
maybe I'll fix things up.

08:52.401 --> 08:54.098
We can make
some money on it.

08:54.142 --> 08:56.710
Nothing good
will come of that house.

08:58.146 --> 08:59.539
Okay.

08:59.582 --> 09:01.889
All right, well, look, uh...

09:01.932 --> 09:04.674
I gotta check on Diane,
so I'll call you tomorrow.

09:04.718 --> 09:06.589
Remember what I said,
Mitch.

09:06.633 --> 09:10.201
I know. I certainly will.

09:10.245 --> 09:12.029
All right,
you take care, Mom.

09:12.073 --> 09:13.553
All right,
I'll speak to you soon.

09:26.217 --> 09:27.610
The power is on.

09:29.656 --> 09:31.788
Was that your mother?

09:31.832 --> 09:33.573
How did you guess?

09:33.616 --> 09:34.835
You always sound like that

09:34.878 --> 09:36.053
when you speak to her.

09:36.097 --> 09:37.838
Like what?

09:37.881 --> 09:40.362
Uh, like a little boy
getting a scolding.

09:40.405 --> 09:42.494
Well, you know
how she can be.

09:42.538 --> 09:46.020
You know, she really has
a problem with this house.

09:46.063 --> 09:48.370
Maybe we should just... Look, it's not the house.

09:48.413 --> 09:50.067
It's Uncle Alex.

09:50.111 --> 09:52.635
Well, you said
they didn't get along.

09:52.679 --> 09:54.724
I think it runs
deeper than that.

09:54.768 --> 09:56.639
You know my mom's devout.

09:56.683 --> 09:59.990
Yes, I have the church
wedding pictures to prove it.

10:00.034 --> 10:02.471
Uncle Alex,
kind of the reverse.

10:02.514 --> 10:04.995
Atheist? No, worse than that,

10:05.039 --> 10:07.650
he was like a spiritualist
or a psychic or whatever.

10:07.694 --> 10:11.393
You know, crystal healing,
tarot cards, all that stuff.

10:11.436 --> 10:13.482
Doesn't sound all that bad.

10:13.525 --> 10:15.136
This is my mom
we're talking about.

10:15.179 --> 10:16.964
Remember, we had to hide
Harry Potterbooks

10:17.007 --> 10:18.618
in the apartment? Right?

10:18.661 --> 10:21.533
Right? Yes.

10:21.577 --> 10:25.842
Anyway, she and Uncle Alex,
they just about got along.

10:25.886 --> 10:28.018
I mean, my dad was always
the peacekeeper.

10:28.062 --> 10:30.412
Wish I could have met him.

10:30.455 --> 10:32.632
Yeah.

10:32.675 --> 10:35.112
I'll never know how he ended up
married to my mom.

10:38.246 --> 10:40.074
Anyway, something happened.

10:41.336 --> 10:43.512
I was around 8 or 9.

10:43.555 --> 10:45.296
We were staying here
for the weekend.

10:45.340 --> 10:47.472
I remember the day before

10:47.516 --> 10:49.474
we were in the basement.

10:49.518 --> 10:52.042
Uncle Alex
was taking pictures.

10:52.086 --> 10:54.262
He had that, uh...
A special camera

10:54.305 --> 10:56.307
that could photograph
your aura.

10:56.351 --> 10:57.613
You ever heard of that?

10:57.657 --> 10:59.223
I think it's called Kirlian.

10:59.267 --> 11:02.313
Is it Kirlian or Kurlian,
or something?

11:02.357 --> 11:04.881
The aura is supposed to
represent your personality

11:04.925 --> 11:07.231
or your guardian angel
or something.

11:07.275 --> 11:09.016
And, oh.

11:09.059 --> 11:10.408
Shoot.

11:10.452 --> 11:11.932
What? I just remember

11:11.975 --> 11:13.716
what I found in the basement
this morning.

11:13.760 --> 11:15.239
I wanna show you something.

13:28.068 --> 13:30.853
I didn't come
to drink tea, Mom.

13:33.725 --> 13:36.076
I came to talk about
what happened with Uncle Alex.

13:37.947 --> 13:39.906
Now look what you made me do.

13:41.908 --> 13:44.040
Wait, Mom, let me...
Will you let me do that?

13:47.739 --> 13:49.219
Why are you doing this to me?

13:51.874 --> 13:53.484
I won't talk about it.

13:53.528 --> 13:55.443
I won't!

13:55.486 --> 13:57.401
If your father were alive...

13:57.445 --> 14:00.448
Well, he isn't, Mom.

14:00.491 --> 14:02.842
Dad's gone,
Uncle Alex is gone.

14:02.885 --> 14:04.452
It's you and me
to deal with this.

14:04.495 --> 14:06.933
I'm sick of all the secrets
in this family.

14:09.022 --> 14:12.242
I've never heard you
speak to me like this, Mitch.

14:12.286 --> 14:13.853
In all my days.

14:15.463 --> 14:16.986
After all I've done for you.

14:18.945 --> 14:21.730
After all the sins
I've forgiven.

14:40.967 --> 14:43.491
I'm worried about Karen.

14:46.929 --> 14:48.931
Not worried enough
to go visit her.

14:50.498 --> 14:53.936
I use to, Mom,
you know I did.

14:53.980 --> 14:55.285
But since Diane and I,
we...

14:59.333 --> 15:03.293
Since we lost the baby,
and then there was the wedding.

15:03.337 --> 15:05.992
The apartment,
you know I lost my job.

15:06.035 --> 15:07.732
Karen's just a long way out.

15:07.776 --> 15:09.256
It was the best place
for her.

15:09.299 --> 15:11.780
Yeah, but wasn't there
some place closer...?

15:11.823 --> 15:13.303
It was the best place.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.741
Your father agreed.

15:16.785 --> 15:18.308
I'm not too sure
he was happy...

15:18.352 --> 15:20.136
Your father agreed.

15:22.269 --> 15:24.184
We agreed as a family.

15:27.665 --> 15:29.493
She needed care.

15:33.019 --> 15:34.759
How is Diane?

15:35.978 --> 15:37.501
She's okay.

15:37.545 --> 15:39.982
Just low blood pressure,
that's all.

15:41.418 --> 15:43.377
Is she taking anything
for it?

15:43.420 --> 15:44.944
Yes.

15:44.987 --> 15:46.423
And resting a lot.

15:46.467 --> 15:48.034
So she should be.

15:50.340 --> 15:51.689
You know, I...

15:54.388 --> 15:56.564
I pray for the two of you
every night.

15:59.871 --> 16:02.135
And you wonder
why I'm concerned

16:02.178 --> 16:04.833
about you staying
in that house?

16:08.619 --> 16:11.796
Diane should be somewhere safe,
in her condition.

16:11.840 --> 16:13.363
Not in a place like that.

16:13.407 --> 16:16.192
Then tell me
what happened there.

16:16.236 --> 16:17.672
Give me a chance
to understand.

16:35.907 --> 16:37.997
You'd just turned
9 years old.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.962
It was cold in that house.

16:47.006 --> 16:49.399
It was always cold.

16:49.443 --> 16:51.967
I don't know why
we went there every winter.

16:55.188 --> 16:56.450
Your uncle...

17:00.106 --> 17:02.238
...was fooling around
with that camera.

17:03.848 --> 17:06.676
He made us all...

17:06.721 --> 17:09.854
pose for pictures
in the cellar.

17:11.334 --> 17:13.380
Dear Lord,
it was cold down there.

17:17.123 --> 17:19.212
Uh, that evening...

17:21.431 --> 17:23.215
your uncle was in a...

17:23.259 --> 17:25.131
A terrible mood.

17:26.654 --> 17:29.744
He ate nothing at dinner...

17:31.572 --> 17:33.922
...said nothing to anyone
all evening.

17:37.099 --> 17:38.709
Well, later that night...

17:41.147 --> 17:44.106
...your father woke me.

17:44.150 --> 17:48.197
Saying that he'd been to check
on you and Karen.

17:50.156 --> 17:51.896
And that Karen was...

17:52.854 --> 17:54.943
was...

17:54.986 --> 17:57.511
missing from her bed.

17:59.295 --> 18:02.124
We checked the bathroom
and...

18:03.343 --> 18:04.822
the other bedrooms.

18:09.044 --> 18:11.220
And your uncle
was missing too.

18:14.049 --> 18:15.964
I don't remember this.

18:17.705 --> 18:19.228
We didn't wanna wake you.

18:25.539 --> 18:26.540
And, uh...

18:28.281 --> 18:30.152
Then we checked the basement.

18:31.936 --> 18:33.721
And there she was.

18:36.245 --> 18:38.378
My little girl.

18:44.079 --> 18:46.168
He had her...

18:48.301 --> 18:51.565
There were... ropes.

18:53.523 --> 18:55.743
Tied around her arms
and legs.

18:57.005 --> 18:58.354
Tying her down.

19:02.837 --> 19:04.099
Her face was...

19:05.622 --> 19:07.189
was wet with tears.

19:09.974 --> 19:11.193
But she wasn't crying.

19:12.977 --> 19:14.631
Not anymore.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.158
She was...

19:19.201 --> 19:20.768
speaking.

19:22.030 --> 19:24.163
Quietly speaking.

19:25.251 --> 19:26.426
The...

19:27.775 --> 19:30.821
The same words over and over.

19:38.089 --> 19:40.004
Get it out of me.

19:41.397 --> 19:43.617
I don't want it in me.

19:49.144 --> 19:51.277
It's hurting me.

20:12.385 --> 20:14.735
So now you know.

20:18.347 --> 20:23.091
Now you know our family's...
dirty little secret.

20:26.834 --> 20:29.402
And I never wanna hear
your uncle's name

20:29.445 --> 20:31.230
mentioned
in this house again.

20:33.057 --> 20:34.494
What...?
What happened next?

20:36.191 --> 20:38.062
You know what happened next.

20:40.935 --> 20:44.634
Karen never recovered
her mind after what he...

20:47.376 --> 20:49.465
After that night.

20:49.509 --> 20:51.815
So is that when it started?

20:51.859 --> 20:53.687
Her illness?

20:53.730 --> 20:55.384
That was the trauma.

20:57.473 --> 20:58.474
Of course, those...

21:00.302 --> 21:03.305
Those so-called doctors,
they couldn't prove anything.

21:03.349 --> 21:05.307
But I know what it was.

21:05.351 --> 21:08.310
It was only then that she
started hearing the voices

21:08.354 --> 21:11.270
and stopped recognizing
her own family.

21:13.533 --> 21:15.361
What happened to uncle?

21:17.406 --> 21:20.279
I mean, did he go to jail?

21:20.322 --> 21:22.672
Well, I told you they
couldn't prove anything.

21:25.371 --> 21:27.416
Karen was too... sick...

21:29.288 --> 21:30.941
to talk to the police.

21:30.985 --> 21:32.378
So we just...

21:33.944 --> 21:35.859
made sure...

21:35.903 --> 21:37.861
never to have contact
with him again.

21:39.863 --> 21:41.474
Of course, he wrote letters.

21:43.954 --> 21:45.869
What did he say?

21:45.913 --> 21:48.350
I burnt them in the fire.

21:50.874 --> 21:52.485
And now...

21:52.528 --> 21:54.530
God willing...

21:54.574 --> 21:57.664
the same thing
is happening to him.

21:57.707 --> 22:01.972
He's burning
in the fire of hell.

22:20.817 --> 22:22.341
What you doing?

22:22.384 --> 22:24.299
I don't know, wasting
my time, probably.

22:24.343 --> 22:26.475
This was the camera
I was telling you about.

22:26.519 --> 22:29.304
Oh, the one that's supposed to
photograph people's auras?

22:29.348 --> 22:31.524
I was just trying to see
if I can get it to work.

22:31.567 --> 22:33.134
Why?

22:33.177 --> 22:35.092
Look at these.

22:35.136 --> 22:36.050
This one's me.

22:38.095 --> 22:39.183
That's your aura?

22:40.620 --> 22:42.752
That's so cool.

22:42.796 --> 22:45.581
So, what do all
the different colors mean?

22:45.625 --> 22:47.453
Here, take a look.

22:51.587 --> 22:56.244
Secrets of Kirlian Photography, by Ada Devere.

22:56.287 --> 22:58.420
Okay, I think I'll
give that one a rest.

22:58.464 --> 23:00.814
All right, well.

23:00.857 --> 23:02.381
Take a look at this picture.

23:03.991 --> 23:05.558
Jesus.

23:05.601 --> 23:07.429
Who is that?

23:07.473 --> 23:09.388
Karen, when she was 7.

23:11.477 --> 23:13.653
What's all
that stuff around her?

23:13.696 --> 23:16.307
I don't know, maybe this camera
is just bullshit.

23:16.351 --> 23:18.048
I don't know.

23:19.876 --> 23:21.835
Wait, stand over there.

23:31.453 --> 23:32.846
Okay, now, don't move.

23:32.889 --> 23:34.543
Wait, wait.

23:34.587 --> 23:36.589
This hasn't got radiation
or anything, has it?

23:36.632 --> 23:37.546
No, it's fine.

23:43.509 --> 23:44.684
Okay, now we wait a second.

23:49.123 --> 23:50.646
Jesus.

23:50.690 --> 23:51.821
What is it?

23:53.127 --> 23:54.302
Look at this.

23:56.435 --> 23:59.481
Is that...?
Is that pink my aura?

23:59.525 --> 24:01.396
Look closer.

24:04.268 --> 24:05.356
Mitch.

24:07.707 --> 24:10.536
It's that...?
Is that the baby's aura?

24:12.320 --> 24:13.669
I don't know.

24:15.410 --> 24:16.890
I think I need
to talk to someone

24:16.933 --> 24:18.195
who knows about this stuff.

24:19.545 --> 24:21.677
Well...

24:21.721 --> 24:23.897
do you think Ada Devere
is still around?

24:28.205 --> 24:29.685
There she is.

24:29.729 --> 24:32.645
Ada Devere,
registered psychic.

24:32.688 --> 24:35.474
Tarot readings, séances,
chakra alignment.

24:35.517 --> 24:37.606
Séances, come on.

24:37.650 --> 24:40.348
Everybody knows all that stuff's
a fraud.

24:40.391 --> 24:42.219
Well, my uncle believed it.

24:42.263 --> 24:44.831
Well, maybe
Uncle Alex believed

24:44.874 --> 24:46.397
he could make money from it.

24:46.441 --> 24:47.964
And that woman too.

24:49.052 --> 24:49.879
Maybe.

25:00.716 --> 25:03.066
So, Mr. Walker...

25:03.110 --> 25:06.461
I gather you are interested
in a tarot reading.

25:06.505 --> 25:08.507
Yes, uh...

25:08.550 --> 25:10.857
My wife and I are about
to start a family.

25:10.900 --> 25:12.336
Your wife is pregnant?

25:12.380 --> 25:13.773
Yes, three months.

25:13.816 --> 25:16.297
Congratulations.
Is it your first?

25:16.340 --> 25:18.473
Uh, yes.

25:18.517 --> 25:19.561
You're not sure?

25:19.605 --> 25:23.086
Well, uh,
we lost a baby.

25:23.130 --> 25:24.435
Before.

25:24.479 --> 25:27.917
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

25:27.961 --> 25:30.572
So you would like to know
what the cards predict

25:30.616 --> 25:32.574
for the immediate future?

25:32.618 --> 25:34.184
That's it, exactly.

25:34.228 --> 25:38.580
You do realize this is not
an exact science.

25:38.624 --> 25:41.148
I can't tell you
which lottery ticket to buy

25:41.191 --> 25:43.324
or what color
to paint the nursery.

25:43.367 --> 25:44.978
I understand.

25:45.021 --> 25:46.936
And your wife
didn't wanna come along?

25:46.980 --> 25:49.591
Oh, well, she's, um...

25:49.635 --> 25:51.506
She's a little skeptical,

25:51.550 --> 25:53.508
I guess you could say.

25:53.552 --> 25:56.598
Well, it's not uncommon
for partners to be skeptical.

25:56.642 --> 26:00.907
But usually, it's the wives
who come to see me.

26:00.950 --> 26:02.909
And the husbands
who stay at home.

26:02.952 --> 26:05.215
Right.

26:05.259 --> 26:08.654
So I'm just wondering,
what makes you the exception?

26:11.178 --> 26:14.660
Well, I just find it all
fascinating.

26:14.703 --> 26:17.793
And, um,
so how does it all work?

26:19.752 --> 26:21.101
Well.

26:29.631 --> 26:31.764
You select a card.

26:44.690 --> 26:46.561
Don't be too concerned.

26:46.605 --> 26:48.694
The cards are not literal.

26:49.825 --> 26:51.348
They need to be interpreted.

26:51.392 --> 26:53.089
And the real meaning

26:53.133 --> 26:56.005
comes from the combination
of the cards.

26:56.049 --> 26:58.094
Now, will you mix
the rest of the pack up,

26:58.138 --> 27:01.184
keeping them face down
at all times.

27:01.228 --> 27:02.621
Okay.

27:02.664 --> 27:04.100
Why do I do this part?

27:04.144 --> 27:06.842
It is said
that by touching the cards,

27:06.886 --> 27:08.278
you imbue them
with your energy,

27:08.322 --> 27:10.193
your hopes,

27:10.237 --> 27:11.760
and your dreams.

27:16.069 --> 27:18.767
Now let's see what
combination we get.

27:23.337 --> 27:24.338
Oh.

27:29.169 --> 27:32.520
Have you suffered a bereavement
in the family recently?

27:32.563 --> 27:34.696
Apart from... Yes.

27:34.740 --> 27:36.306
My unc...

27:36.350 --> 27:39.440
Grandfather passed away
a month ago.

27:39.483 --> 27:41.442
Really?

27:41.485 --> 27:44.097
Were you close? Yes.

27:44.140 --> 27:46.229
What was the cause of death,
exactly?

27:46.273 --> 27:49.493
Uh, it was, uh, cancer.

27:49.537 --> 27:50.973
It was very sudden.

27:51.017 --> 27:52.192
What was his name?

27:52.235 --> 27:54.020
His name, uh...

27:54.063 --> 27:55.804
Mr. Walker!

27:55.848 --> 27:59.460
If you have come here
to waste my time and yours,

27:59.503 --> 28:01.897
then I suggest you leave.

28:01.941 --> 28:05.118
The cost of the reading is $98,
and that goes for

28:05.161 --> 28:08.338
real or fictional members
of your family.

28:10.601 --> 28:12.952
I'm sorry.

28:12.995 --> 28:15.824
I just didn't wanna give you
any information.

28:15.868 --> 28:17.565
I've read about these things.

28:17.608 --> 28:19.480
You people ask questions,

28:19.523 --> 28:22.439
and then people tell you
their life stories.

28:22.483 --> 28:24.790
You feed back the same
information, as if by magic.

28:24.833 --> 28:26.530
I have never claimed to know

28:26.574 --> 28:28.707
anything about magic,
Mr. Walker.

28:30.752 --> 28:34.408
Now, why don't we stop
pretending that you've come here

28:34.451 --> 28:36.366
for a tarot reading.

28:36.410 --> 28:39.761
And tell me more about
your uncle,

28:39.805 --> 28:42.503
I think you were gonna say.

28:42.546 --> 28:46.768
And whatever it is that you have
in your jacket pocket

28:46.812 --> 28:48.335
that you would like
to show me.

28:48.378 --> 28:49.553
How do you know that?

28:49.597 --> 28:51.164
You keep putting
your hand on it

28:51.207 --> 28:52.992
to make sure
it's still there.

28:55.429 --> 28:56.604
All right.

29:09.965 --> 29:11.010
Who is this girl?

29:11.053 --> 29:12.968
That's my sister.

29:13.012 --> 29:15.971
It's an old picture
from when she was 7.

29:16.015 --> 29:18.539
This was taken with
a Kirlian camera?

29:18.582 --> 29:20.584
Yes, by my uncle.

29:20.628 --> 29:23.370
He was kind of in your
profession, before he died.

29:27.678 --> 29:28.723
What is it?

29:31.508 --> 29:33.032
Alexander, do you pray?

29:34.685 --> 29:36.687
Yes, you heard of it?

29:39.516 --> 29:42.955
I should have known immediately.
I saw the picture.

29:42.998 --> 29:45.653
Alexander was the only person
who persevered

29:45.696 --> 29:48.438
with the Kirlian
photography equipment,

29:48.482 --> 29:50.266
when everybody else
thought it was a fad.

29:54.183 --> 29:56.882
So Alexander has passed away?

29:58.666 --> 30:01.321
I'm sorry,
I didn't know you knew him.

30:01.364 --> 30:02.888
Were you friends?

30:02.931 --> 30:04.803
Yeah, kind of.

30:04.846 --> 30:05.847
It was a long time ago.

30:10.591 --> 30:11.679
And, um...

30:13.463 --> 30:15.683
where is your sister now?

30:15.726 --> 30:19.034
She's in a mental health
facility.

30:20.731 --> 30:21.471
Near the coast.

30:23.125 --> 30:24.605
Been there almost
all her life.

30:24.648 --> 30:26.868
Since what age?

30:26.912 --> 30:29.262
Well, she was fine
to begin with.

30:29.305 --> 30:32.613
But by the time
that picture was taken,

30:32.656 --> 30:34.528
she had suffered a trauma.

30:34.571 --> 30:35.355
Trauma?

30:37.183 --> 30:38.967
I think she was hurt
by my uncle.

30:39.011 --> 30:39.968
Hurt?

30:41.013 --> 30:43.624
You know, abused.

30:43.667 --> 30:46.757
By Alexander?

30:47.584 --> 30:48.977
It's unlikely.

30:50.718 --> 30:52.589
No, I don't think your uncle

30:52.633 --> 30:55.157
was the cause of her trauma.

30:55.201 --> 30:57.377
I think that is.

30:59.901 --> 31:01.294
And what is that?

31:01.337 --> 31:04.688
How long ago
was this picture taken?

31:04.732 --> 31:07.300
Thirty years.

31:09.258 --> 31:11.478
There is a chance
she may be free of it.

31:11.521 --> 31:12.914
Free of what?

31:12.958 --> 31:15.047
If only there was
a way to make sure.

31:16.962 --> 31:18.050
Well,
I still have the camera.

31:19.312 --> 31:22.358
The Kirlian camera?

31:22.402 --> 31:24.708
Could you get your sister
in front of it?

31:24.752 --> 31:26.362
I don't know, I mean...

31:26.406 --> 31:28.669
Mr. Walker!

31:28.712 --> 31:30.714
My advice to you
is to get your sister

31:30.758 --> 31:32.760
out of that facility,

31:32.803 --> 31:35.197
and in front of
the Kirlian camera.

31:35.241 --> 31:38.026
There is a chance
that I can help her.

31:39.419 --> 31:41.987
But first we have to know,

31:42.030 --> 31:44.337
if she still carries
this with her.

31:47.731 --> 31:50.125
Just one more question.

31:50.169 --> 31:53.085
You said this photograph
was taken 30 years ago.

31:55.043 --> 31:57.916
Can you tell me
the exact date?

31:59.352 --> 32:02.529
Uh, my mom said
I just turned 9.

32:02.572 --> 32:04.400
So that would make it
November.

32:07.621 --> 32:09.144
Thank you.

32:12.843 --> 32:14.280
Yeah, Dr. Simms.

32:14.323 --> 32:16.717
Jeff, I'm not a doctor.

32:16.760 --> 32:18.110
Karen Walker, right?

32:18.153 --> 32:19.981
Yeah, uh, it's my sister.

32:32.254 --> 32:34.300
Is she always like this?

32:34.343 --> 32:35.692
Pretty much.

32:43.048 --> 32:43.874
Does she talk?

32:45.267 --> 32:46.965
Not that I've heard.

32:47.008 --> 32:48.009
Likes to draw, though.

32:49.837 --> 32:51.317
Draw?

32:51.360 --> 32:53.188
Use to draw on the walls,

32:53.232 --> 32:55.408
so they gave her some paper
and a pencil.

32:55.451 --> 32:57.323
Some of it's in the file,
I think.

33:01.849 --> 33:04.243
She's not dangerous, is she?

33:08.464 --> 33:10.292
Wasn't there a form
or something to say

33:10.336 --> 33:11.641
why she was committed?

33:11.685 --> 33:13.992
Well, that will be
the pink form.

33:20.215 --> 33:21.173
Well, that's weird.

33:22.087 --> 33:23.479
What?

33:23.523 --> 33:25.438
This is normally signed
by a doctor.

33:25.481 --> 33:28.658
But this one just says,
"transferred to resident status

33:28.702 --> 33:30.747
by personal consent of Ellen..."
No, "Elaine."

33:30.791 --> 33:33.098
Elaine Walker?

33:33.141 --> 33:35.404
Yeah, that's...
That's my mom.

33:35.448 --> 33:37.276
I've never seen
one of these before.

33:38.451 --> 33:40.409
Well, what does it mean?

33:40.453 --> 33:42.716
Your sister was never
committed.

33:42.759 --> 33:46.459
She was placed in the care
of this facility voluntarily...

33:46.502 --> 33:48.461
by permission
of Elaine Walker.

33:54.249 --> 33:56.208
So does that mean
she's free to leave?

33:56.251 --> 33:57.861
Do you have ID?

34:17.838 --> 34:18.534
Karen.

34:20.536 --> 34:22.495
I'm gonna start
the car now, okay?

34:22.538 --> 34:24.105
I'm gonna take you home.

34:27.152 --> 34:28.196
All right?

34:32.766 --> 34:33.897
Karen, it's Mitch.

34:35.551 --> 34:38.032
It's your brother, Mitch,
remember me?

34:38.076 --> 34:39.077
Huh?

34:43.994 --> 34:45.170
All right.

34:48.824 --> 34:49.956
Oh, come on.

34:52.132 --> 34:53.743
Come on.

35:29.997 --> 35:31.129
Who is this?

35:31.172 --> 35:33.174
Is this your sister!

35:33.218 --> 35:35.785
Keep your voice down?
I don't wanna freak her out.

35:35.829 --> 35:38.353
Mitch! Your mom put her
into that facility

35:38.397 --> 35:40.181
because she needs
professional care!

35:46.318 --> 35:47.145
Excuse me, Karen.

35:50.017 --> 35:52.237
You okay?

35:52.280 --> 35:55.283
It's just my blood pressure.
I took the stairs too fast.

35:55.327 --> 35:57.938
All right, well, let me help you
to the couch, come on.

35:57.981 --> 36:00.158
No, really, I'm okay.

36:00.201 --> 36:03.030
It's okay,
I just need to sit down.

36:03.073 --> 36:05.989
You probably shouldn't leave
Karen downstairs by herself.

36:06.033 --> 36:08.340
She's fine, I just
wanna make sure you're ok...

36:09.645 --> 36:11.212
Shit, you're right.

36:12.257 --> 36:13.345
You are right.

36:16.130 --> 36:17.349
Karen, I...

36:19.264 --> 36:20.700
Shit.

36:44.898 --> 36:45.899
Oh.

36:47.509 --> 36:49.032
Here you are.

36:51.121 --> 36:52.340
October.

36:56.779 --> 36:57.693
November.

37:29.247 --> 37:30.900
Is she asleep?

37:32.685 --> 37:34.295
I think so,
it's hard to tell.

37:34.339 --> 37:36.515
I left her on the couch.

37:36.558 --> 37:39.257
So did she do it? Do what?

37:39.300 --> 37:40.823
Oh, you know what.

37:40.867 --> 37:42.303
Break the camera.

37:42.347 --> 37:44.131
No, no, it just
slipped off the stand.

37:44.174 --> 37:45.611
I should've
tightened the screw.

37:45.654 --> 37:47.874
That stuff's old.
It could have broken loose.

37:47.917 --> 37:49.397
Yeah, right.

37:50.877 --> 37:52.705
She's not violent, Diane.

38:03.977 --> 38:06.066
So can you fix it?

38:07.894 --> 38:08.895
What?

38:08.938 --> 38:10.505
The camera, dummy.

38:12.768 --> 38:15.249
Maybe, yeah,
I think the film's ruined.

38:15.293 --> 38:18.905
But I can't imagine
a place that sells it.

38:23.779 --> 38:25.259
I'm sorry.

38:25.303 --> 38:28.349
It's just sometimes,
you know...

38:28.393 --> 38:30.873
Sometimes I'm just
so scared for the baby.

38:30.917 --> 38:32.658
Look.

38:32.701 --> 38:34.312
It's gonna be okay,
all right?

38:35.704 --> 38:38.446
Even my mom
is praying for us.

41:12.078 --> 41:13.775
What are you doing?

41:13.819 --> 41:16.125
I'm just checking
if she's real.

41:16.169 --> 41:18.171
Well, how did she
get up here?

41:18.214 --> 41:19.346
I don't know.

41:23.045 --> 41:24.699
I don't know what I'm doing.

41:27.615 --> 41:28.964
Maybe we should
take her back.

41:52.684 --> 41:55.164
Mitch, it's getting cold.

41:55.208 --> 41:58.080
Shoot, I left Karen's sweater
in the basement.

41:58.124 --> 41:59.821
Okay, I'll go down
and get it.

41:59.865 --> 42:02.432
You just work on getting her
into the car.

42:02.476 --> 42:04.826
Karen, we're gonna get you
in the car now, okay?

42:07.612 --> 42:08.961
Easy.

42:24.542 --> 42:26.239
Jesus, Karen, please!

42:36.641 --> 42:38.512
Hey!

42:38.556 --> 42:40.645
I thought you said
the camera was broken.

42:48.522 --> 42:51.003
It was on the ground in pieces,
all the film spilled out.

42:51.046 --> 42:52.744
Are you sure? Yes.

42:55.094 --> 42:58.227
Well, then you must be
seeing things.

42:58.271 --> 42:59.315
Uh-huh.

43:01.491 --> 43:02.797
Mitch, where are going?

43:02.841 --> 43:04.407
To get Karen.

43:04.451 --> 43:05.931
I wanna get
that picture taken.

43:05.974 --> 43:07.280
Right now.

43:20.598 --> 43:22.643
Do you want me
to hold her?

43:22.687 --> 43:24.645
I don't think it matters.

43:41.880 --> 43:43.708
I got to get this to Ada.

43:43.751 --> 43:45.884
You're not leaving me here
with Karen, are you?

43:45.927 --> 43:47.494
Yeah, she'll be fine,
don't worry.

43:47.537 --> 43:50.062
How do I look after her?

43:50.105 --> 43:52.455
I mean,
should I call your mother?

43:52.499 --> 43:54.457
No. She mustn't know
about this.

43:54.501 --> 43:56.155
She'll go crazy
if she finds out

43:56.198 --> 43:57.591
I brought Karen
back to this house.

43:57.635 --> 43:58.897
She'll be fine.

44:08.820 --> 44:10.343
It's worse, isn't it?

44:13.912 --> 44:16.436
Is that what you expected?

44:16.479 --> 44:19.787
Well, I thought
there might be a small chance

44:19.831 --> 44:21.659
it had left her,
but, uh...

44:24.923 --> 44:25.793
What is it?

44:28.187 --> 44:31.843
This may not be easy
for you to hear, Mr. Walker.

44:31.886 --> 44:33.714
Listen, if there's a way
to help Karen,

44:33.758 --> 44:35.716
I don't care what it is.

44:35.760 --> 44:36.848
Right.

44:39.111 --> 44:41.853
I want you to listen
very carefully.

44:52.254 --> 44:55.344
"Since long before
recorded history,

44:55.388 --> 44:59.131
our Earth has been
inhabited by a form of..."

44:59.174 --> 45:02.874
I hesitate to use
the word, "life..."

45:02.917 --> 45:04.876
as the rules of life
that we know

45:04.919 --> 45:07.182
do not apply to these beings.

45:09.184 --> 45:12.318
Nevertheless,
a form of entity...

45:12.361 --> 45:15.234
"that we cannot,
under normal circumstances,

45:15.277 --> 45:17.889
"see or sense...

45:17.932 --> 45:20.413
"On rare occasions
throughout history,

45:20.456 --> 45:23.024
"these entities have,
for one reason or another,

45:23.068 --> 45:26.811
"strayed into
our plane of existence.

45:28.813 --> 45:31.206
Mankind has described them
as best he can."

45:34.253 --> 45:37.778
The Catholics saw
demons and devils.

45:37.822 --> 45:41.782
In the Islamic world,
they are called jinns.

45:41.826 --> 45:44.872
It is where the word
"genie" comes from.

45:44.916 --> 45:46.526
They don't look like genies.

45:46.569 --> 45:49.181
I'm not referring
to what you may have seen

45:49.224 --> 45:50.791
in cartoons, Mr. Walker.

45:54.621 --> 45:58.320
"These entities can be
very dangerous.

45:58.364 --> 46:02.063
"Most don't concern themselves
with humankind,

46:02.107 --> 46:04.936
"but those that do travel
to our plane,

46:04.979 --> 46:07.939
"or are brought here,

46:07.982 --> 46:09.810
"can be very vindictive.

46:11.290 --> 46:13.596
"Such a being
would think nothing

46:13.640 --> 46:15.381
"of invading a human soul

46:15.424 --> 46:19.167
purely with the intent to cause
suffering and misery."

46:21.953 --> 46:24.694
So is one of these...
things...

46:25.826 --> 46:27.741
in my sister?

46:27.785 --> 46:31.266
Of that,
I am 100 percent certain.

46:31.310 --> 46:35.140
The photograph you showed me
leaves me in no doubt.

46:35.183 --> 46:37.577
And it's been there
all this time?

46:39.840 --> 46:42.625
A decade is the blink of an eye
for such a creature.

46:43.844 --> 46:45.498
They are eternal.

46:48.414 --> 46:49.807
Listen.

46:49.850 --> 46:51.678
You said she could be helped.

46:51.721 --> 46:53.854
Yes, perhaps.

46:55.900 --> 46:58.816
I can only try, Mr. Walker.

47:10.871 --> 47:12.655
Elaine, hi.

47:12.699 --> 47:14.222
Diane, dear.

47:14.266 --> 47:16.355
I'm so pleased
to hear your voice.

47:16.398 --> 47:18.531
I'm so worried
about what happened.

47:18.574 --> 47:20.620
Carry boxes
around the place.

47:20.663 --> 47:22.883
Well, I'm fine.

47:22.927 --> 47:25.668
I told him that house
is no place for you.

47:25.712 --> 47:28.889
It's so cold, don't you think? DIANE: Yeah, I suppose.

47:28.933 --> 47:31.587
Lord knows what
kind of state it's in.

47:31.631 --> 47:33.154
You know, there's...

47:33.198 --> 47:34.982
There's plenty
of space here.

47:40.422 --> 47:41.641
Diane?

47:41.684 --> 47:43.686
Oh, yeah, sorry.

47:43.730 --> 47:45.601
The reception
isn't good here.

47:45.645 --> 47:47.299
I'm in the basement.

47:47.342 --> 47:49.692
Whatever are you
doing in there?

47:56.917 --> 47:58.266
Diane, what is it!

48:06.884 --> 48:08.320
N-no!

48:08.363 --> 48:09.582
Diane!

48:09.625 --> 48:11.323
Mr. Walker.

48:11.366 --> 48:13.281
Mitch, my name's Mitch.

48:15.718 --> 48:16.850
Okay, Mitch.

48:18.808 --> 48:21.463
Most people tend to have
difficulty

48:21.507 --> 48:25.859
in accepting the information
I'm giving you.

48:25.903 --> 48:28.427
They don't like to think
that the things depicted

48:28.470 --> 48:30.472
in this book may be for real.

48:31.996 --> 48:33.127
But you?

48:33.171 --> 48:34.563
I've been seeing things.

48:37.001 --> 48:38.567
Since Karen's been
in the house.

48:40.787 --> 48:42.702
Like the camera.

48:42.745 --> 48:44.138
She broke it last night.

48:44.182 --> 48:45.966
I swear it was in pieces
on the ground.

48:46.010 --> 48:47.576
This morning, fine.

48:49.796 --> 48:52.930
Well, I told you these beings
can be very vindictive.

48:54.366 --> 48:55.758
They are not bound

48:55.802 --> 48:59.719
by the constraints
of our reality.

48:59.762 --> 49:03.418
They are able to create
their own alternate realities,

49:03.462 --> 49:07.945
or at least give the appearance
of doing so.

49:07.988 --> 49:10.686
That is why helping Karen
is gonna be very hard.

49:13.341 --> 49:14.995
Mitch.

49:15.039 --> 49:18.042
I'm sorry to say that I believe
that this being

49:18.085 --> 49:21.436
is very comfortable
inside your sister's body.

49:23.221 --> 49:26.006
It clearly enjoys
tormenting people.

49:26.050 --> 49:31.620
And who better to torment
than an innocent young girl?

49:33.231 --> 49:37.757
I believe that's why
it chose her.

49:37.800 --> 49:40.978
It chooses to afflict
the youngest,

49:41.021 --> 49:43.676
most innocent soul
in the house.

49:45.025 --> 49:47.201
It knows our worst fears.

49:49.595 --> 49:51.771
And uses them against us.

49:55.688 --> 49:56.906
Excuse me.

49:58.778 --> 50:00.127
Diane?

50:12.792 --> 50:14.663
You wanna talk
about what happened today?

50:14.707 --> 50:15.925
No.

50:15.969 --> 50:17.057
What you thought happened?

50:19.886 --> 50:22.367
You thought something happened,
but it didn't, right?

50:22.410 --> 50:24.238
I don't wanna talk about it.

50:24.282 --> 50:26.719
It's like when I thought
Karen broke the camera.

50:26.762 --> 50:30.766
I could swear I saw it. I did
see it, but it never happened.

50:30.810 --> 50:32.464
Look.

50:32.507 --> 50:34.379
These things,

50:34.422 --> 50:36.033
they scare us,
but they're not real.

50:40.037 --> 50:42.909
It can only scare us
if we let it, Diane.

51:07.020 --> 51:08.456
You must be Diane.

51:26.561 --> 51:28.085
Should I bring Karen down?

51:28.128 --> 51:30.739
No, not just yet.

51:30.783 --> 51:33.612
I need to lay down
some ground rules first.

51:33.655 --> 51:35.396
So, what is this?

51:35.440 --> 51:36.832
Some kind of exorcism?

51:36.876 --> 51:38.486
Were you raised a Catholic?

51:38.530 --> 51:40.706
No, well, yeah, kind of.

51:40.749 --> 51:42.273
On my mom's side.

51:42.316 --> 51:43.491
Oh, dear.

51:43.535 --> 51:46.015
It's always harder
to unlearn

51:46.059 --> 51:47.669
what one has learned.

51:47.713 --> 51:49.367
If it makes you feel
any better,

51:49.410 --> 51:51.325
I didn't pay attention
in Sunday school.

51:51.369 --> 51:52.979
Well, the Catholics
have their ways

51:53.022 --> 51:55.677
with their fancy costumes
and shiny trinkets.

51:55.721 --> 51:57.157
And sometimes it even works,

51:57.201 --> 51:58.898
though not for the reason
they think.

52:01.379 --> 52:03.424
Now, these are
my ground rules.

52:04.947 --> 52:07.211
I'm going to conduct a séance

52:07.254 --> 52:10.083
to try and contact the entity
inside Karen's body.

52:11.606 --> 52:15.306
This means
we need to link hands.

52:15.349 --> 52:17.525
Now, no matter what you hear,

52:17.569 --> 52:19.658
no matter what you see,

52:19.701 --> 52:23.052
no matter how traumatic
or emotional the situation,

52:23.096 --> 52:25.490
you must not break
the séance,

52:25.533 --> 52:27.361
until I give you
the command to do so.

52:30.364 --> 52:33.193
Maintaining contact
with such a creature

52:33.237 --> 52:36.370
takes up an enormous amount
of energy and concentration.

52:37.719 --> 52:38.807
It may be temperamental.

52:39.939 --> 52:41.288
And aggressive.

52:43.638 --> 52:46.337
Breaking contact too soon

52:46.380 --> 52:48.817
could be disastrous,

52:48.861 --> 52:50.254
for all of us.

52:53.822 --> 52:55.607
You said rules.

52:55.650 --> 52:56.521
Is that everything?

52:57.739 --> 53:00.568
No.

53:00.612 --> 53:03.005
Your wife must not
come into this basement

53:03.049 --> 53:05.182
at any time.

53:05.225 --> 53:06.748
I'm sure she'll be
fine with that.

53:06.792 --> 53:09.055
At any time, Mitch.

53:12.580 --> 53:14.147
Got it.

53:17.585 --> 53:19.108
Does she know
what she's doing?

53:21.067 --> 53:22.808
I don't know, I think so.

53:22.851 --> 53:25.114
Mitch, what if this thing,

53:25.158 --> 53:27.595
whatever it is,
what if it hurts Karen,

53:27.639 --> 53:28.814
makes her worse?

53:31.033 --> 53:32.426
I don't think
that's possible.

53:34.167 --> 53:35.081
Put her there.

53:40.129 --> 53:42.262
And she'll have to be
bound into place.

53:42.306 --> 53:44.830
Really? Mitch.

53:44.873 --> 53:49.182
The struggle will not only be
spiritual but physical.

53:49.226 --> 53:50.749
The entity will be trying

53:50.792 --> 53:53.360
to gain dominance
over Karen's soul.

53:53.404 --> 53:55.667
It is not unknown
for the afflicted subject

53:55.710 --> 53:58.365
to suffer harm...

53:58.409 --> 53:59.845
or even death,

53:59.888 --> 54:01.412
during the process.

54:09.333 --> 54:10.638
Take her hand, Mitch.

54:13.685 --> 54:15.469
Be firm.

54:17.341 --> 54:18.994
Remember what I told you.

54:23.347 --> 54:28.700
Linking hands opens the channels
of communication.

54:28.743 --> 54:31.833
It also creates
a link between us

54:31.877 --> 54:33.792
and the entity's
astral plane.

54:36.925 --> 54:40.668
If we break hands too early,
we will fail to banish it.

54:46.326 --> 54:48.067
So, what happens now?

54:50.852 --> 54:52.419
Ada?

54:52.463 --> 54:54.334
Karen Walker.

54:55.944 --> 54:57.424
Karen.

54:57.468 --> 54:58.947
Karen Walker.

55:00.732 --> 55:03.300
I want to speak
to Karen Walker.

55:05.389 --> 55:07.304
Karen, can you hear me?

55:08.479 --> 55:11.482
I wanna speak
to Karen Walker.

55:14.528 --> 55:15.355
Karen.

55:18.402 --> 55:20.708
Karen, can you hear me?

55:20.752 --> 55:23.494
I wanna speak
to Karen Walker.

55:25.974 --> 55:27.193
Karen!

55:28.586 --> 55:29.587
Can you hear me?

55:30.718 --> 55:31.415
Help me.

55:33.939 --> 55:36.855
Karen, is that you?

55:36.898 --> 55:38.639
Help me.

55:38.683 --> 55:39.858
It hurts.

55:39.901 --> 55:41.120
Be calm, Karen.

55:42.426 --> 55:44.515
We are going to help you.

55:44.558 --> 55:47.300
Your brother is here with me.

55:47.344 --> 55:50.651
We are going to help you.

55:50.695 --> 55:52.349
It won't let you.

55:52.392 --> 55:55.352
We're going to take away
the pain, Karen.

55:55.395 --> 55:56.918
It won't let you.

55:56.962 --> 55:59.312
It likes hurting me,
it doesn't wanna stop.

55:59.356 --> 56:02.271
Nevertheless,
we will continue.

56:02.315 --> 56:03.534
You can't.

56:04.622 --> 56:06.754
It'll hurt me.

56:06.798 --> 56:07.929
It'll kill me!

56:07.973 --> 56:10.018
I don't think so, Karen.

56:10.062 --> 56:11.455
It will.

56:11.498 --> 56:13.021
It'll kill me
if you come for it.

56:13.065 --> 56:15.502
If it kills you, Karen,

56:15.546 --> 56:17.678
it will have nowhere to go.

56:19.550 --> 56:21.116
It will hurt you.

56:22.640 --> 56:25.251
It will hurt all of you.

56:25.294 --> 56:28.907
What if I speak
to it kindly, Karen?

56:28.950 --> 56:32.432
What if I try to persuade it
not to do such a thing?

56:34.826 --> 56:37.263
It doesn't wanna
talk to you.

56:37.306 --> 56:38.743
What if I...

56:38.786 --> 56:41.528
It doesn't wanna
listen to you.

56:41.572 --> 56:43.312
It doesn't wanna
listen to you!

56:44.966 --> 56:46.838
It doesn't wanna
listen to you!

56:54.019 --> 56:55.412
Ada.

57:21.742 --> 57:23.701
Can it really hurt Karen?

57:25.703 --> 57:27.095
I mean, really.

57:29.924 --> 57:32.666
If it kills her, Mitch,

57:32.710 --> 57:34.886
her soul will leave her body.

57:34.929 --> 57:37.497
And the creature will be
forced out with it.

57:37.541 --> 57:39.107
Now, we know
it doesn't want that.

57:41.414 --> 57:42.676
But it will fight.

57:43.721 --> 57:44.678
Hard.

57:51.337 --> 57:54.296
You know,
there was this one time,

57:54.340 --> 57:55.472
when we were kids...

57:57.909 --> 58:00.433
...there were these
two big, old fallen trees

58:00.477 --> 58:01.478
we used to climb on.

58:03.784 --> 58:05.873
One time, I finally
plucked up courage to jump

58:05.917 --> 58:08.093
from one to the other.

58:08.136 --> 58:10.704
It seemed like some kind of
achievement, I guess.

58:12.140 --> 58:13.402
So I dared Karen to do it.

58:14.752 --> 58:16.536
She was a lot smaller
than me.

58:16.580 --> 58:18.886
I knew she couldn't do it,
but I dared her anyway.

58:20.584 --> 58:21.628
So she jumped.

58:23.021 --> 58:24.370
And of course,
she fell short.

58:26.372 --> 58:29.549
And as she grabbed for the tree,
her hand got caught.

58:29.593 --> 58:30.594
She broke her wrist.

58:33.640 --> 58:36.774
I'll never forget the sound
and the way she cried.

58:41.343 --> 58:42.910
So I carried her back home.

58:42.954 --> 58:44.999
I took a scolding
from my mom,

58:45.043 --> 58:46.871
while my dad drove us
to the hospital.

58:49.787 --> 58:51.484
I learnt right there
what it meant

58:51.528 --> 58:52.746
to be a big brother.

58:56.054 --> 58:57.621
I was supposed to
look out for Karen.

58:59.405 --> 59:00.580
Protect her.

59:03.627 --> 59:06.586
You're doing
the right thing, Mitch.

59:06.630 --> 59:08.980
You couldn't have
stopped that creature

59:09.023 --> 59:11.939
from inhabiting Karen's body.

59:11.983 --> 59:13.593
You were just a child
yourself.

59:15.987 --> 59:20.513
Fortunately for you,
the creature chose the youngest,

59:20.557 --> 59:22.080
most innocent soul.

59:23.734 --> 59:25.039
If it hadn't been Karen...

59:26.475 --> 59:27.607
it would have been you.

59:48.410 --> 59:50.456
Let's try this again.

01:00:12.739 --> 01:00:14.654
Karen.

01:00:14.698 --> 01:00:15.960
Karen Walker.

01:00:17.657 --> 01:00:20.355
I wanna speak
with Karen Walker.

01:00:21.792 --> 01:00:22.793
Karen Walker.

01:00:24.490 --> 01:00:27.841
I wanna speak
to Karen Walker.

01:00:29.713 --> 01:00:30.975
Karen.

01:00:32.019 --> 01:00:33.281
Karen Walker.

01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:36.241
Something's wrong.

01:00:36.284 --> 01:00:39.026
I wanna speak
to Karen Walker.

01:00:39.070 --> 01:00:41.289
Ada, I think
something's wrong.

01:00:41.333 --> 01:00:44.205
Diane Walker.

01:00:44.249 --> 01:00:46.207
This is a message for you

01:00:46.251 --> 01:00:49.558
about your husband, Mitch.

01:00:49.602 --> 01:00:51.430
You know Mitch.

01:00:51.473 --> 01:00:53.388
Can't hold down a job.

01:00:53.432 --> 01:00:55.521
Can't make a baby.

01:00:55.564 --> 01:00:57.044
Karen Walker.

01:00:57.088 --> 01:01:01.048
I wanna speak
to Karen Walker.

01:01:01.092 --> 01:01:03.007
Your baby's gonna die.

01:01:03.050 --> 01:01:05.444
Your husband
can't make a baby.

01:01:05.487 --> 01:01:07.446
It's gonna die!

01:01:07.489 --> 01:01:08.229
No. Karen!

01:01:12.712 --> 01:01:14.496
Karen.

01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:15.889
Karen Walker.

01:01:18.022 --> 01:01:20.285
I wanna speak
with Karen Walker.

01:01:24.724 --> 01:01:26.813
It's you again.

01:01:26.857 --> 01:01:28.946
It doesn't wanna talk to you.

01:01:28.989 --> 01:01:29.773
That's fine.

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:33.124
I wanna speak to Karen.

01:01:36.344 --> 01:01:37.824
I have your brother here,
Karen.

01:01:40.174 --> 01:01:42.220
Do you remember
your brother, Mitch?

01:01:43.395 --> 01:01:44.178
Mitch?

01:01:46.137 --> 01:01:47.138
He left me.

01:01:48.792 --> 01:01:50.097
Left me to rot.

01:01:51.533 --> 01:01:52.752
Forgot about me.

01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:55.886
Mitch is sorry.

01:01:57.539 --> 01:01:59.454
He wants to help you.

01:01:59.498 --> 01:02:00.760
He can't.

01:02:00.804 --> 01:02:02.588
It will hurt me.

01:02:02.631 --> 01:02:04.242
It will kill me.

01:02:04.285 --> 01:02:05.809
Mitch is sorry he left you.

01:02:07.767 --> 01:02:10.770
And he's sorry for the time
that you got hurt.

01:02:10.814 --> 01:02:13.164
Do you remember
what happened in the woods?

01:02:16.384 --> 01:02:17.472
Yes.

01:02:17.516 --> 01:02:18.647
It hurt.

01:02:20.606 --> 01:02:21.781
Mitch hurt me.

01:02:24.175 --> 01:02:27.787
Do you remember
what happened?

01:02:27.831 --> 01:02:30.485
You jumped from a tree.

01:02:31.399 --> 01:02:33.097
Yes.

01:02:33.140 --> 01:02:34.489
Mitch made me jump.

01:02:35.577 --> 01:02:36.274
It's his fault.

01:02:37.754 --> 01:02:39.364
He hates me.

01:02:39.407 --> 01:02:42.193
And you hurt yourself,
didn't you?

01:02:42.236 --> 01:02:43.368
Yes.

01:02:43.411 --> 01:02:45.022
You broke your leg.

01:02:47.633 --> 01:02:50.288
Yes, my leg hurt so much.

01:02:51.637 --> 01:02:53.900
It's Mitch's fault.

01:02:53.944 --> 01:02:55.597
He wanted to hurt me.

01:02:55.641 --> 01:02:57.208
Oh, really?

01:02:57.251 --> 01:02:58.600
Yes.

01:02:58.644 --> 01:03:00.777
That's why he's here.

01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:02.822
He wants it to hurt me.

01:03:02.866 --> 01:03:04.606
He wants it to kill me.

01:03:04.650 --> 01:03:07.392
But you didn't break your leg,
did you, Karen?

01:03:07.435 --> 01:03:10.525
It was only your wrist.

01:03:22.624 --> 01:03:23.887
Fuck you,

01:03:23.930 --> 01:03:27.151
dirty cock-sucking cunt!

01:03:35.899 --> 01:03:37.248
Ada.

01:03:39.511 --> 01:03:41.861
Well, it didn't like that,
did it?

01:03:45.734 --> 01:03:47.214
You tricked it?

01:03:47.258 --> 01:03:49.956
Oh, I suspected
it was taunting us.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.871
Pretending to be Karen.

01:03:51.915 --> 01:03:53.699
Trying to discourage us.

01:03:53.742 --> 01:03:54.874
That's what they feed on.

01:03:54.918 --> 01:03:57.485
Emotional pain.

01:03:57.529 --> 01:04:00.010
You see, they have
no physical body...

01:04:01.533 --> 01:04:03.448
only the one
they infiltrate.

01:04:07.495 --> 01:04:09.497
So, what's our next move?

01:04:09.541 --> 01:04:11.499
I have to rest.

01:04:13.545 --> 01:04:15.286
Can you give me
the book, please?

01:04:35.219 --> 01:04:39.049
And you'd better check
how your wife is holding out.

01:04:39.092 --> 01:04:40.050
Yeah.

01:04:51.409 --> 01:04:53.411
When will this be over?

01:04:53.454 --> 01:04:55.630
I don't know.
Uh, Ada's really tired.

01:04:55.674 --> 01:04:57.632
Oh, Ada's tired?

01:04:57.676 --> 01:04:58.982
Well, I'm tired.

01:04:59.025 --> 01:05:00.635
I'm tired of all of this.

01:05:00.679 --> 01:05:03.290
It's driving me mad.

01:05:03.334 --> 01:05:05.466
I'm hearing things,
and I'm seeing things.

01:05:05.510 --> 01:05:07.642
I know, me too, it's okay.

01:05:07.686 --> 01:05:09.906
Why is this happening?

01:05:09.949 --> 01:05:12.430
Ada says it's taunting us,
it's playing on our fears.

01:05:12.473 --> 01:05:13.779
What is?

01:05:13.822 --> 01:05:15.302
I can't explain it.

01:05:15.346 --> 01:05:17.435
Well, that's not
good enough, Mitch.

01:05:17.478 --> 01:05:18.740
Well, Ada's the expert.

01:05:18.784 --> 01:05:20.394
Then I'll go
and speak to Ada!

01:05:22.527 --> 01:05:23.615
Diane!

01:05:26.879 --> 01:05:28.141
Ada. Out!

01:05:28.185 --> 01:05:29.708
Ada.

01:05:29.751 --> 01:05:31.579
Mitch, you have to
get her out of here.

01:05:31.623 --> 01:05:32.972
What is happening?

01:05:33.016 --> 01:05:33.973
I said get out!

01:05:34.017 --> 01:05:35.366
You better do as she says.

01:05:35.409 --> 01:05:36.933
Do as she says.

01:05:38.935 --> 01:05:39.892
Mitch.

01:05:41.198 --> 01:05:43.940
You must obey
my ground rules.

01:05:48.422 --> 01:05:49.728
Are we making progress?

01:05:49.771 --> 01:05:51.164
Absolutely.

01:05:51.208 --> 01:05:53.384
She looks worse.

01:05:53.427 --> 01:05:55.342
That's because we brought
the entity closer

01:05:55.386 --> 01:05:57.214
to the surface.

01:05:57.257 --> 01:06:00.434
When it is so deep
in a person's soul,

01:06:00.478 --> 01:06:03.089
only the Kirlian camera
can detect its presence.

01:06:04.699 --> 01:06:07.093
But be warned...

01:06:07.137 --> 01:06:09.748
when we banish it entirely
from your sister's body...

01:06:12.011 --> 01:06:14.448
...there may be a moment

01:06:14.492 --> 01:06:16.450
when we both
come face-to-face with it.

01:06:19.018 --> 01:06:21.064
I have seen people panic,

01:06:21.107 --> 01:06:23.370
almost lose their minds,

01:06:23.414 --> 01:06:26.025
when confronted
with such a being.

01:06:28.027 --> 01:06:30.029
You've done this before?

01:06:30.073 --> 01:06:31.335
Banish such a creature?

01:06:32.858 --> 01:06:34.642
No, never.

01:06:34.686 --> 01:06:36.209
But you've seen one?

01:06:38.907 --> 01:06:40.561
In this house.

01:06:40.605 --> 01:06:41.910
You've been here before.

01:06:52.269 --> 01:06:54.488
Well...

01:06:54.532 --> 01:06:56.447
I haven't seen that picture
in a long while.

01:06:58.275 --> 01:07:00.886
I was wondering
where it had got to.

01:07:00.929 --> 01:07:03.106
It was inside that book.

01:07:03.149 --> 01:07:05.151
Well, that figures.
I haven't had cause

01:07:05.195 --> 01:07:07.110
to look in this book
for many years.

01:07:09.112 --> 01:07:10.722
Thirty years, to be exact.

01:07:12.506 --> 01:07:14.247
Why didn't you tell me?

01:07:14.291 --> 01:07:17.207
Would it have made
any difference if I had?

01:07:17.250 --> 01:07:19.600
I don't know.
Why don't you tell me now?

01:07:24.953 --> 01:07:29.001
Well,
I knew your uncle, of course.

01:07:29.045 --> 01:07:32.700
Back in those days,
a group of us would do the tours

01:07:32.744 --> 01:07:34.441
of the psychic fairs,
most of them

01:07:34.485 --> 01:07:36.574
were fakes and charlatans,

01:07:36.617 --> 01:07:40.360
but there was
a close knot of five.

01:07:40.404 --> 01:07:43.885
Me, Alexander,
and three others.

01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:49.456
Now, we understood
the true power

01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:53.286
inherent in the knowledge
we possessed.

01:07:53.330 --> 01:07:55.071
Or at least,
we thought we did.

01:07:57.943 --> 01:08:01.903
Alexander invested in the
Kirlian photography equipment.

01:08:01.947 --> 01:08:04.689
Some of the others thought
it was a cheap parlor trick,

01:08:04.732 --> 01:08:06.343
photographing auras
for a dollar apiece.

01:08:08.171 --> 01:08:11.130
But his theory was...

01:08:11.174 --> 01:08:14.220
that if the camera
could capture auras

01:08:14.264 --> 01:08:17.788
invisible to the naked eye...

01:08:17.832 --> 01:08:20.357
then it might be able to reveal
other things too.

01:08:22.054 --> 01:08:24.491
Things like these entities?

01:08:26.189 --> 01:08:27.145
Yeah.

01:08:28.538 --> 01:08:30.367
See, a creature like this

01:08:30.410 --> 01:08:34.327
had never been photographed
in the whole of history.

01:08:34.371 --> 01:08:36.895
Can you imagine
our excitement

01:08:36.938 --> 01:08:39.636
at the possibility
of such a triumph?

01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:41.769
It would have vindicated
our whole profession.

01:08:44.207 --> 01:08:45.947
But of course,

01:08:45.991 --> 01:08:47.819
first of all,
we had to find one.

01:08:50.952 --> 01:08:55.131
Or make one come to us.

01:08:58.002 --> 01:08:59.526
You brought it here?

01:09:02.877 --> 01:09:06.707
The instructions
for summoning were all here,

01:09:06.751 --> 01:09:08.361
if you knew where to look.

01:09:12.408 --> 01:09:15.586
So the five of us gathered here,
in the basement,

01:09:15.629 --> 01:09:18.415
to hold a séance.

01:09:18.457 --> 01:09:20.982
We were planning to reach out
to their plane.

01:09:21.026 --> 01:09:22.636
We thought we knew
what we were doing.

01:09:25.029 --> 01:09:27.075
Well, none of us were prepared
for the terrors

01:09:27.118 --> 01:09:29.513
that we unleashed.

01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:36.563
Of course, we tried
to send it back.

01:09:36.607 --> 01:09:38.390
Banish it back
to its own plane.

01:09:38.435 --> 01:09:40.263
But you failed.

01:09:44.223 --> 01:09:47.225
The circle was broken
too early.

01:09:49.272 --> 01:09:50.403
I realize that now.

01:09:53.276 --> 01:09:57.628
You know, that night
so disturbed us...

01:09:57.671 --> 01:09:59.456
that we never saw
each other again.

01:09:59.499 --> 01:10:02.459
We just couldn't
face each other.

01:10:02.502 --> 01:10:04.243
And it wasn't until
you showed me

01:10:04.287 --> 01:10:06.245
that picture of Karen

01:10:06.289 --> 01:10:08.378
and told me the date
when she fell sick...

01:10:10.815 --> 01:10:13.774
That's when I realized...

01:10:13.818 --> 01:10:18.083
that somehow this creature

01:10:18.126 --> 01:10:20.085
managed to stay
in this house.

01:10:21.217 --> 01:10:22.261
Lying in wait...

01:10:23.567 --> 01:10:26.657
for a fresh, young soul.

01:10:30.008 --> 01:10:31.227
So you're responsible?

01:10:34.621 --> 01:10:36.493
Karen's been tortured
for 30 years

01:10:36.536 --> 01:10:38.277
by something you
brought into this house!

01:10:38.321 --> 01:10:39.670
Mitch, I didn't know.

01:10:39.713 --> 01:10:42.673
Your uncle never told me.

01:10:42.716 --> 01:10:44.805
He would have known immediately,
of course,

01:10:44.849 --> 01:10:47.939
as soon as the picture
was developed.

01:10:47.982 --> 01:10:51.769
And he would have tried to do
what we're doing now.

01:10:51.812 --> 01:10:54.467
But as soon as your parents
took Karen away...

01:10:55.947 --> 01:10:59.080
and broke all contact...

01:10:59.124 --> 01:11:00.865
...there would have been
nothing more

01:11:00.908 --> 01:11:01.996
he could have done.

01:11:08.089 --> 01:11:09.439
He wrote letters.

01:11:13.138 --> 01:11:14.444
He wrote letters to my mom.

01:11:16.097 --> 01:11:17.273
But she burned them.

01:11:19.666 --> 01:11:20.406
Jesus.

01:11:21.668 --> 01:11:22.887
He tried to tell her.

01:11:25.542 --> 01:11:27.283
I'm sorry, Mitch.

01:11:39.382 --> 01:11:41.862
You're going to fail.

01:11:41.906 --> 01:11:43.516
Karen. Mitch, wait.

01:11:44.778 --> 01:11:45.953
That is not Karen.

01:11:47.172 --> 01:11:49.348
You're going to fail.

01:11:49.392 --> 01:11:51.219
And you're going to die.

01:11:51.263 --> 01:11:54.179
So you've finally given up
on the pretense?

01:11:54.222 --> 01:11:57.487
It hurts.

01:11:59.140 --> 01:12:01.360
Are you gonna let me
speak to Karen or not?

01:12:01.404 --> 01:12:03.319
Karen is busy.

01:12:04.407 --> 01:12:05.930
Where is she?

01:12:05.973 --> 01:12:09.020
She's in here with me.

01:12:13.154 --> 01:12:14.547
Then we'll continue.

01:12:21.989 --> 01:12:25.166
What are you doing? This has gone on long enough.

01:12:25.210 --> 01:12:27.560
I believe there is
only one option left

01:12:27.604 --> 01:12:29.388
to end Karen's suffering.

01:12:36.613 --> 01:12:38.136
Take her hand, Mitch.

01:12:42.532 --> 01:12:44.272
No, God.

01:12:44.316 --> 01:12:45.883
There must be another way.

01:12:45.926 --> 01:12:47.232
If Karen dies,

01:12:47.275 --> 01:12:49.930
her soul will leave her body

01:12:49.974 --> 01:12:52.411
and this Earth.

01:12:52.455 --> 01:12:55.414
And this evil bastard
will be taken with it.

01:12:55.458 --> 01:12:56.720
You wouldn't dare.

01:12:56.763 --> 01:12:57.373
Fuck you!

01:12:58.461 --> 01:12:59.766
Cunt!

01:12:59.810 --> 01:13:01.594
You see how angry
it's becoming?

01:13:01.638 --> 01:13:05.468
You wouldn't dare
kill your own sister.

01:13:05.511 --> 01:13:09.385
You couldn't
fucking fight it!

01:13:09.428 --> 01:13:12.649
Mommy's boy.

01:13:25.052 --> 01:13:27.490
Why are you
doing this to me?

01:13:29.492 --> 01:13:30.710
Mom?

01:13:30.754 --> 01:13:32.756
Ignore it, Mitch.

01:13:32.799 --> 01:13:34.888
After I forgave
all your sins?

01:13:36.063 --> 01:13:37.325
What sins?

01:13:37.369 --> 01:13:38.805
I didn't hurt anyone.

01:13:38.849 --> 01:13:41.765
You sinned against
the Lord, Mitch.

01:13:41.808 --> 01:13:45.203
That's why your
bastard child died.

01:13:45.246 --> 01:13:48.293
I prayed for it every day.

01:13:48.336 --> 01:13:50.295
And the good Lord,
in his wisdom,

01:13:50.338 --> 01:13:52.602
took your bastard child

01:13:52.645 --> 01:13:55.300
and cast it
into the pits of hell,

01:13:55.343 --> 01:13:56.910
where it belongs.

01:13:56.954 --> 01:13:58.434
Don't listen to her, Mitch.

01:13:58.477 --> 01:14:00.479
Alongside your bastard father

01:14:00.523 --> 01:14:02.655
who had his dirty way
with other women

01:14:02.699 --> 01:14:04.309
whenever my back was turned.

01:14:04.352 --> 01:14:05.310
That's not true!

01:14:05.353 --> 01:14:06.833
Mitch, don't!

01:14:06.877 --> 01:14:09.009
Your anger feeds its power.

01:14:09.053 --> 01:14:11.838
You're all I have
in the world, Mitch.

01:14:11.882 --> 01:14:13.100
Mom.

01:14:13.144 --> 01:14:14.275
No.

01:14:15.494 --> 01:14:16.495
Don't!

01:14:39.257 --> 01:14:40.650
Karen?

01:14:44.044 --> 01:14:46.133
Jesus, I think she's dead.

01:14:48.353 --> 01:14:49.397
Karen?

01:14:53.576 --> 01:14:54.533
No!

01:15:00.408 --> 01:15:04.238
No!

01:15:08.504 --> 01:15:09.983
Mitch?

01:15:14.118 --> 01:15:15.423
Karen.

01:15:15.467 --> 01:15:17.121
Karen, can you hear me?

01:15:17.164 --> 01:15:18.383
Karen?

01:15:19.776 --> 01:15:21.125
Karen!

01:15:30.787 --> 01:15:32.005
Karen?

01:15:38.142 --> 01:15:39.230
It's Mitch.

01:15:41.493 --> 01:15:42.712
You're home.

01:15:45.149 --> 01:15:46.106
All right.

01:15:48.892 --> 01:15:49.719
It's okay.

01:15:52.939 --> 01:15:55.289
Oh, it's all right.
It's all right.

01:16:09.477 --> 01:16:10.870
I gotta make sure.

01:16:18.486 --> 01:16:20.706
I gotta get you up, okay?

01:16:22.012 --> 01:16:23.579
What are you doing?

01:16:24.667 --> 01:16:27.321
You sit here, all right.

01:16:31.717 --> 01:16:32.631
Di.

01:16:36.592 --> 01:16:40.204
Karen, it's just a camera,
all right.

01:16:40.247 --> 01:16:41.640
I'm gonna take a picture.

01:16:59.919 --> 01:17:02.574
Ada, it's...
It's worked!

01:17:05.882 --> 01:17:07.057
It's gone.

01:17:10.364 --> 01:17:12.323
Okay, Karen, all right.

01:17:12.366 --> 01:17:14.238
Here we go, okay.

01:17:14.281 --> 01:17:15.718
You all right?

01:17:17.633 --> 01:17:18.851
Where are mom and dad?

01:17:20.723 --> 01:17:22.333
You've been away a long time.

01:17:23.813 --> 01:17:24.814
I know.

01:17:27.381 --> 01:17:30.428
Listen, I'll take her
upstairs.

01:17:30.471 --> 01:17:33.605
You better go check on Ada.
She doesn't look too good.

01:17:35.259 --> 01:17:36.869
Ada.

01:17:36.913 --> 01:17:37.914
You all right?

01:17:39.089 --> 01:17:39.829
Ada?

01:17:44.834 --> 01:17:46.009
Ada?

01:18:32.098 --> 01:18:33.491
Hey, Mom.

01:18:33.534 --> 01:18:36.320
Mitch, you didn't
call me yesterday.

01:18:36.363 --> 01:18:38.235
And Diane sounded so strange.

01:18:38.278 --> 01:18:39.845
I've been beside myself
with worry.

01:18:39.889 --> 01:18:43.501
Everything is fine,
Mom.

01:18:43.544 --> 01:18:45.546
All right, everything...

01:18:45.590 --> 01:18:46.983
Mitch?

01:18:49.855 --> 01:18:53.163
Mitch, are you there?

01:18:53.206 --> 01:18:55.905
The creature chose
the youngest,

01:18:55.948 --> 01:18:58.168
most innocent soul.
