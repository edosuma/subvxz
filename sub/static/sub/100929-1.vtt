WEBVTT

01:09.568 --> 01:11.569
I wish I
didn't have any holes.

01:11.571 --> 01:12.770
If I didn't have to worry about

01:12.772 --> 01:14.073
things going in and
out of my holes,

01:14.075 --> 01:15.974
life would be so much easier.

01:15.976 --> 01:18.344
Sure I'd have to give up
talking and I like talking,

01:18.346 --> 01:20.379
but I'd also get to give
up public rest rooms.

01:20.381 --> 01:21.746
I mean there's always
something on the seat lid,

01:21.748 --> 01:23.648
it's just like why?

01:23.650 --> 01:25.350
Historically I will
choose the handicap stall

01:25.352 --> 01:26.484
which is my personal favorite

01:26.486 --> 01:27.653
because it's
usually the cleanest

01:27.655 --> 01:29.555
and it has the most leg room.

01:29.557 --> 01:31.689
But lately I've been
experiencing increased anxiety

01:31.691 --> 01:33.624
that some kid in a
wheelchair will be waiting

01:33.626 --> 01:34.760
outside the stall when I exit

01:34.762 --> 01:36.594
and he's going to glare
at me once he sees

01:36.596 --> 01:38.397
that I'm clearly
physically unafflicted.

01:38.399 --> 01:39.531
The more times I use
the handicap stall,

01:39.533 --> 01:40.431
the likelier it is to happen.

01:40.433 --> 01:41.567
It's like a car crash,

01:41.569 --> 01:42.934
it's not a matter of if,
it's just a matter of when.

01:42.936 --> 01:44.669
But then if I don't drive a car,

01:44.671 --> 01:45.704
how will I get anywhere
when the bus is unreliable

01:45.706 --> 01:47.472
and filled with homeless people?

01:47.474 --> 01:49.108
Or social delinquents who
resemble homeless people.

01:49.110 --> 01:50.109
I suppose if you
were truly homeless

01:50.111 --> 01:51.076
you wouldn't take the bus either

01:51.078 --> 01:52.511
because you couldn't afford it

01:52.513 --> 01:53.746
or have nowhere to
go, one or the other.

01:53.748 --> 01:55.013
Todd I think we're
getting a bit off topic.

01:55.015 --> 01:56.915
Well it's my job
to be tangential,

01:56.917 --> 01:59.084
it's your job to magically
relate everything to my problems.

01:59.086 --> 02:02.821
Okay you treat sex like
the kid in a wheelchair.

02:02.823 --> 02:04.157
The handicap stall is a metaphor

02:04.159 --> 02:05.892
for your state of
sexual confusion,

02:05.894 --> 02:07.594
and you're afraid of the kid

02:07.596 --> 02:09.627
because he might tell you
you're in a wheelchair too.

02:09.630 --> 02:10.763
But I'm not in a wheelchair.

02:10.764 --> 02:12.765
You're in an
emotional wheelchair.

02:12.767 --> 02:13.633
So does that mean I'm not gay?

02:13.635 --> 02:16.805
I don't know, it's
just a metaphor.

02:17.973 --> 02:19.506
I think I might not be gay.

02:19.508 --> 02:21.608
- You're gay.
- You don't know that.

02:21.610 --> 02:23.876
Todd your favorite
film is "Legally Blonde".

02:23.878 --> 02:25.043
Well that's just it,

02:25.045 --> 02:26.179
I've always dismissed
the possibility

02:26.181 --> 02:27.813
of having any
heterosexual feelings,

02:27.815 --> 02:29.082
but I think that's
because I've been

02:29.084 --> 02:31.817
socially conditioned
to be gay, gay, gay.

02:31.819 --> 02:33.787
Kids have been calling
me a faggot at recess

02:33.789 --> 02:34.620
since the second grade,

02:34.622 --> 02:35.755
I never really had
the opportunity

02:35.757 --> 02:37.556
to explore the female gender.

02:37.558 --> 02:38.924
So you wanna
start dating girls?

02:38.926 --> 02:41.727
I think it would statistically
improve my love life.

02:41.729 --> 02:42.929
Don't take this the wrong way,

02:42.931 --> 02:46.499
but even if you
wanted to experiment,

02:46.501 --> 02:47.767
I don't think you
would find anyone.

02:47.769 --> 02:49.637
Girls aren't gay-blind anymore,

02:49.639 --> 02:50.638
this isn't the '60s.

02:50.640 --> 02:52.173
And you're no Rock Hudson.

02:52.175 --> 02:53.674
I don't think that
I'm that transparent,

02:53.676 --> 02:55.976
I could just be
metro. Or a hipster.

02:55.978 --> 02:58.078
Todd you're like a Kinsey six.

02:58.080 --> 03:00.914
Maybe a five when you're
not wearing cashmere.

03:00.916 --> 03:02.782
Well I think that I can
get it down to a three.

03:02.784 --> 03:03.651
Francis says that

03:03.653 --> 03:05.585
- my masculinity has been
- His therapist.

03:05.587 --> 03:07.121
suppressed by my own
precognitions of sexual identity,

03:07.123 --> 03:08.823
and she think that
I could be happier

03:08.825 --> 03:10.723
if I'm more aggressive and
I don't let political labels

03:10.725 --> 03:11.859
like gay define me.

03:11.861 --> 03:13.760
Sorry political labels?

03:13.762 --> 03:15.462
Yes we choose to be gay.

03:15.464 --> 03:17.965
Can I choose to punch
you in the face right now?

03:17.967 --> 03:19.567
I don't mean that we choose
who we're attracted to.

03:19.569 --> 03:22.203
Okay both of you stop.

03:22.205 --> 03:24.504
Todd do you like gay sex?

03:24.506 --> 03:25.705
He wouldn't know,

03:25.707 --> 03:28.842
- he's never had any.
- What, no really?

03:28.844 --> 03:29.710
I can't, it makes
me think of poop,

03:29.712 --> 03:30.777
And I don't like poop.

03:30.779 --> 03:32.045
The smell, the image, the sound,

03:32.047 --> 03:33.746
the texture, not that
I've ever touched it,

03:33.748 --> 03:34.814
oh God even thinking about
poop makes me want to vomit.

03:34.816 --> 03:36.684
Does thinking about
vomit make you wanna poo?

03:36.686 --> 03:37.686
Okay no one likes poop.

03:37.688 --> 03:39.688
I could offer an
anecdote to the contrary.

03:39.690 --> 03:40.521
What about Jerry?

03:40.523 --> 03:42.591
You at least gave
him a blow job.

03:42.593 --> 03:45.196
For a few seconds, it was
more of a blow consultation.

03:46.929 --> 03:48.597
Maybe you're bisexual.

03:48.599 --> 03:51.199
No I'm sorry this
is recockulous.

03:51.201 --> 03:54.002
Todd you can not decide
that you're straight

03:54.004 --> 03:55.203
just because you don't like

03:55.205 --> 03:56.705
the gay people
you've been meeting.

03:56.707 --> 03:58.272
I like girls, I've
always liked girls.

03:58.274 --> 04:00.876
They're pretty, and they're
clean and they're soft.

04:00.878 --> 04:03.677
You can find all those qualities
in a decorative pillow.

04:03.679 --> 04:04.979
No you can't they're
not always soft,

04:04.981 --> 04:06.681
that's why they're not
called functional pillows

04:06.683 --> 04:08.717
and for two they're not always
clean unless you steam them.

04:08.719 --> 04:10.085
- Oh my God.
- Todd I think

04:10.087 --> 04:11.019
you're missing the point.

04:11.021 --> 04:12.253
No you're missing the point.

04:12.255 --> 04:14.556
I'm undergoing a severe
sexual identity crisis

04:14.558 --> 04:17.825
and neither of my only two
friends are taking me seriously.

04:17.827 --> 04:19.594
Okay I am sorry.

04:19.596 --> 04:21.732
I support you so does Ryder.

04:22.798 --> 04:24.800
- Yay.
- Thank you,

04:24.802 --> 04:25.800
because I do need your help.

04:25.802 --> 04:29.872
I'm still a little bit
scared of the p-word.

04:29.874 --> 04:30.773
- Pillow?
- Poop?

04:30.775 --> 04:32.210
No you know, meow.

04:36.547 --> 04:39.648
Okay Todd, if you
can't say the word pussy,

04:39.650 --> 04:41.651
you're definitely gay.

04:41.653 --> 04:43.985
I can say it, I just
think it's vulgar.

04:43.987 --> 04:45.023
Then say it.

04:47.157 --> 04:47.992
Pussy.

04:49.994 --> 04:54.999
Todd say I wanna
fuck some pussy.

05:00.071 --> 05:01.607
I wanna fuck some pussy.

05:13.651 --> 05:14.286
I'm straight.

05:16.055 --> 05:17.723
I'm straight.

05:21.759 --> 05:25.228
I'm straight, I
like bean burritos

05:25.230 --> 05:29.866
and motorcycles and

05:29.868 --> 05:34.274
motorcycles and pussy.

05:48.654 --> 05:49.288
- Hi.
- Hi.

05:52.891 --> 05:54.657
Do you come here a lot?

05:54.659 --> 05:56.258
- What?
- I said do

05:56.260 --> 05:58.027
you come here a lot?

05:58.029 --> 06:01.334
Oh I thought you
said do I come a lot.

06:02.902 --> 06:04.167
That's not what I said.

06:04.169 --> 06:06.804
Yes on both accounts.

06:06.806 --> 06:07.974
My boyfriend is a god.

06:09.643 --> 06:12.309
Well as long as he doesn't
support religious genocide.

06:12.311 --> 06:14.211
You're so cute!

06:14.213 --> 06:16.280
My friend Tracy would love you.

06:16.282 --> 06:18.818
- Tracy!
- Somebody rang?

06:28.794 --> 06:29.929
Is anybody sitting here?

06:31.830 --> 06:36.837
No I'm
completely alone.

06:42.909 --> 06:45.076
Are you all right?

06:45.078 --> 06:46.780
No I'm not.

06:48.749 --> 06:51.016
- Okay.
- My best friend from home

06:51.018 --> 06:52.951
was supposed to fly into
L.A. for my birthday,

06:52.953 --> 06:54.853
but then some pigeon
ran into the engine...

06:54.855 --> 06:56.087
Oh my God. Avian ingestion?

06:56.089 --> 06:57.255
That's literally my
third worst nightmare.

06:57.257 --> 06:59.324
What was the death count?

06:59.326 --> 07:00.425
What?

07:00.427 --> 07:02.894
No it just got delayed but then

07:02.896 --> 07:04.865
now I have no one
to buy me drinks.

07:08.069 --> 07:09.270
I can buy you a drink.

07:10.336 --> 07:11.171
Really?

07:12.807 --> 07:14.908
Do you wanna be
my birthday buddy?

07:17.745 --> 07:20.814
- Okay.
- Yay, let's do shots.

07:21.982 --> 07:24.483
My momma wanted me
to go to Ohio State

07:24.485 --> 07:26.784
but I was like,
"I'm turning 18!"

07:26.786 --> 07:28.153
That's 40 in pop star years.

07:28.155 --> 07:29.488
Wait how old are you now?

07:29.490 --> 07:31.923
18 but don't worry,

07:31.925 --> 07:34.793
my momma installed me
with Southern values.

07:34.795 --> 07:36.229
I do not hook up.

07:36.231 --> 07:37.897
Like that Kelly Clarkson song,

07:37.899 --> 07:39.431
"I Do Not Hook Up".

07:39.433 --> 07:41.066
- Instilled.
- What?

07:41.068 --> 07:43.303
And I think Ohio's
in the Midwest.

07:43.305 --> 07:44.503
What are you tryna say?

07:44.505 --> 07:46.972
So you shouldn't
have southern values.

07:46.974 --> 07:49.778
Oh
yeah you're right.

07:50.445 --> 07:52.010
I'm in L.A. now.

08:00.921 --> 08:04.224
You've like done
this before right?

08:04.226 --> 08:06.760
Oh yeah, yeah lots of times.

08:06.762 --> 08:09.432
Oh good. Me too.
So many times.

08:11.500 --> 08:13.265
- Oh God what is that?
- What's wrong?

08:15.936 --> 08:17.436
Oh my God!

08:17.438 --> 08:18.438
Get it off ooh!

08:18.440 --> 08:20.039
It was like that
scene in "Alien"

08:20.041 --> 08:21.907
after they eat dinner with the,

08:21.909 --> 08:23.308
you know that scene?

08:24.513 --> 08:25.846
Well I don't pay
you to laugh at me.

08:25.848 --> 08:27.781
Your parents pay me.

08:27.783 --> 08:28.451
Yeah well.

08:29.518 --> 08:34.020
Frankly Todd, I'm
surprised by your behavior.

08:34.023 --> 08:35.890
You're willfully barking
up the wrong tree,

08:35.892 --> 08:38.494
but I'm unclear as to
what you're even chasing.

08:39.494 --> 08:40.861
Is it sex?

08:40.863 --> 08:42.361
Is it love?

08:42.364 --> 08:43.563
What do you want?

08:43.566 --> 08:45.465
I don't know what I want.

08:45.467 --> 08:47.801
I know what I don't want.

08:47.803 --> 08:50.805
I don't wanna be alone
for the rest of my life.

08:52.874 --> 08:54.177
Excuse me
do you work here?

09:11.027 --> 09:12.964
Tell me
you don't love me.

09:14.398 --> 09:16.163
Tell me you don't love me
and I'll let you get on

09:16.165 --> 09:18.834
that Korean Air flight
and never look back.

09:18.836 --> 09:22.240
My whole life
I've been waiting

09:23.874 --> 09:28.279
for you to appear in my
life and make me whole.

09:32.548 --> 09:33.647
That was good Rory.

09:33.649 --> 09:36.151
I think she should be crying
the this scene though,

09:36.153 --> 09:39.921
so take a minute and
then we'll try again.

09:39.923 --> 09:41.522
- Okay.
- And I see on your

09:41.524 --> 09:45.560
special skills you can do a
Zooey Deschanel impression.

09:45.562 --> 09:46.563
I'd love to hear it.

09:48.532 --> 09:51.502
It's so soft, I can't
believe it's not cotton.

09:52.535 --> 09:54.337
I'm probably gonna
take that off.

09:55.505 --> 09:56.872
Do you have any
other questions

09:56.874 --> 09:59.007
before we give
this another whirl?

09:59.009 --> 10:01.310
No, no I mean yes,

10:01.312 --> 10:03.645
are you really asking or is
that just an obligatory gesture?

10:03.647 --> 10:05.648
I'm really asking.

10:05.650 --> 10:06.481
This isn't a comedy right?

10:06.483 --> 10:10.619
- No.
- So Jenna has a genius IQ,

10:10.621 --> 10:13.556
it say she's runway gorgeous
and she studies Jujutsu.

10:13.558 --> 10:15.358
I am having some
trouble understanding

10:15.360 --> 10:16.893
why she'd be attracted to Jonah

10:16.895 --> 10:18.594
who doesn't work
out, he's unemployed

10:18.596 --> 10:20.462
and they have absolutely
nothing in common.

10:20.464 --> 10:23.331
Remember Jenna
has a troubled past.

10:23.333 --> 10:24.566
Right yes, dead dad.

10:24.568 --> 10:25.534
Which I get 'cause
I have that, so

10:25.536 --> 10:26.503
I can understand if it
was like a whole solace,

10:26.505 --> 10:28.470
I just wanna fuck the
pain away kind of thing,

10:28.472 --> 10:29.504
although you'd think
with all her CIA training

10:29.506 --> 10:30.472
she'd develop some equanimity.

10:30.474 --> 10:32.675
But she chooses to stay
with him in Wisconsin

10:32.677 --> 10:34.110
over potentially
thwarting a North Korean

10:34.112 --> 10:36.180
nuclear missile
crisis I mean that's,

10:37.212 --> 10:38.015
that's a lot.

10:38.015 --> 10:40.318
People do crazy things
when they're in love.

10:41.486 --> 10:43.552
Okay now you're just
quoting "Hercules".

10:53.632 --> 10:54.664
Right,
you done cleaning up?

10:54.666 --> 10:56.633
Hi yes yeah I am.

10:56.635 --> 10:57.801
Again I'm so sorry I was late,

10:57.803 --> 11:00.269
my audition went really long
and the 405 was backed up.

11:00.271 --> 11:01.471
- Just...
- No don't even

11:01.473 --> 11:04.109
worry about it yeah
I'm firing you.

11:05.143 --> 11:06.710
- What?
- I would have fired you

11:06.712 --> 11:09.212
when you got in but
Jamie called in sick,

11:09.214 --> 11:11.148
- and we were short-handed.
- Why didn't you fire Jamie?

11:11.150 --> 11:12.615
I like Jamie,

11:12.617 --> 11:14.621
and you clearly don't
want to be a waitress so.

11:15.954 --> 11:17.656
Who the fuck wants
to be a waitress?

11:26.665 --> 11:28.233
The food here sucks!

11:29.734 --> 11:33.003
Oh put that back!

11:33.005 --> 11:33.673
Put I back!

11:36.008 --> 11:37.741
Is this seat taken?

11:37.743 --> 11:39.577
Does it look like it's taken?

11:39.579 --> 11:40.712
Don't deflect move

11:40.714 --> 11:41.949
- the story forward.
- Okay.

11:45.585 --> 11:48.922
No would you like to
join me for a cup of joe?

11:54.460 --> 11:56.162
Have I seen you
somewhere before?

11:57.730 --> 12:00.698
Maybe, are you familiar
with the filmography

12:00.700 --> 12:03.534
of Lars Von Trier?

12:03.536 --> 12:05.636
So you're an actress?

12:05.638 --> 12:08.072
Do you want my autograph?

12:08.074 --> 12:08.709
Have you ever
done a sex scene?

12:12.144 --> 12:13.079
Hmm. Does rape count?

12:14.714 --> 12:15.950
No.

12:17.083 --> 12:18.085
Okay Rory, um.

12:20.420 --> 12:22.687
We're not gonna tell you
what you can and can't say.

12:22.689 --> 12:24.659
We're not the PC police

12:26.159 --> 12:27.659
but rape is never funny.

12:27.661 --> 12:29.328
I thought it was funny.

12:29.330 --> 12:30.595
I didn't laugh.

12:30.597 --> 12:31.796
It's not like I was
mocking rape victims,

12:31.798 --> 12:33.598
I was mocking actors.

12:33.600 --> 12:36.068
Uh-huh, not everybody
can make that distinction.

12:36.070 --> 12:38.369
Well it's not my fault if
people are fucking stupid.

12:38.371 --> 12:41.540
My best friend was
date raped in college.

12:41.542 --> 12:43.478
That made me feel
really uncomfortable.

12:44.644 --> 12:46.310
See Rory. It's
different for people

12:46.312 --> 12:48.313
who've actually been
affected by sexual abuse.

12:48.315 --> 12:49.718
Yes I would know, thank you.

12:53.788 --> 12:55.521
If you need to
talk to someone,

12:55.523 --> 12:58.556
my best friend really
loves her therapist.

12:58.558 --> 12:59.590
Your date rape friend?

12:59.592 --> 13:01.225
No, Colleen moved to Boston.

13:01.227 --> 13:03.529
We don't really talk any more.

13:07.334 --> 13:09.133
Hey Karen it's your daughter.

13:09.135 --> 13:10.170
Just calling to chat.

13:11.172 --> 13:12.104
How's Sri Lanka?

13:12.106 --> 13:12.774
I hear they have great...

13:13.641 --> 13:15.075
What do they have in Sri Lanka?

13:15.077 --> 13:16.542
Anyway I'm trying
to be less negative

13:16.544 --> 13:18.578
so I'm gonna sandwich
technique this for you.

13:18.580 --> 13:21.484
It didn't rain. So
that's positive.

13:23.684 --> 13:26.618
I got fired and everybody
in my improv class

13:26.620 --> 13:28.754
thinks I'm a huge bitch
and I got a parking ticket

13:28.756 --> 13:31.590
and I think there's a dead
mouse in my garbage disposal.

13:31.592 --> 13:35.295
So that's my negative thing.

13:35.297 --> 13:37.629
That's all 24 hours so
it counts as one thing.

13:37.631 --> 13:41.801
And positive, positive,
what's positive?

13:41.803 --> 13:44.774
Oh I thought I saw Amy
Adams at Trader Joes.

13:46.241 --> 13:48.744
But it was just
Isla Fischer. So.

13:50.678 --> 13:54.848
I'm out here living the dream.

13:54.850 --> 13:57.816
Hey, you know that saying
shoot for the moon,

13:57.818 --> 13:59.820
even if you miss you'll
land among the stars?

13:59.822 --> 14:01.825
I did some research
and apparently

14:03.259 --> 14:05.259
the closest star
excluding our sun,

14:05.261 --> 14:06.693
is still four light
years away from Earth.

14:06.695 --> 14:08.361
So if you miss the moon,

14:08.363 --> 14:10.599
you don't land on anything ever.

14:11.733 --> 14:14.237
You just float
aimlessly in space

14:15.538 --> 14:16.406
until you die.

14:20.809 --> 14:24.847
Okay so call me back
sometime or whatever. Bye.

15:40.657 --> 15:42.491
Excuse me do you work here?

15:42.493 --> 15:44.894
No but I get that a
lot, I don't know why.

15:44.896 --> 15:46.529
You're restocking the shelves.

15:46.531 --> 15:48.331
Oh some of the books
are out of order.

15:48.333 --> 15:49.799
Yeah but it's not your job.

15:49.801 --> 15:52.468
Valid. Counterpoint, I
was at Staples the other day

15:52.470 --> 15:53.636
and somebody asked me
if we sold paperweights

15:53.638 --> 15:55.838
and I wasn't doing anything,
I was just standing there.

15:55.840 --> 15:57.240
Were you wearing a red shirt?

15:57.242 --> 15:57.876
No.

15:59.844 --> 16:01.276
I know what your problem is,

16:01.278 --> 16:02.544
you have a very
friendly demeanor,

16:02.546 --> 16:04.746
like you look super helpful.

16:04.748 --> 16:06.448
Can I fix that?

16:06.450 --> 16:09.017
Yeah sure, don't make
eye contact, don't smile.

16:09.019 --> 16:10.719
The more you can project
an air of antipathy,

16:10.721 --> 16:11.621
the less you'll be approached.

16:11.623 --> 16:13.425
It's not a hobby,
it's a way of life.

16:15.759 --> 16:16.727
I'm ignoring you.

16:17.628 --> 16:19.594
- It's convincing.
- I can practice later.

16:19.596 --> 16:20.596
Sorry am I in your way?

16:20.598 --> 16:21.731
Everything's sort of in
disarray at the moment.

16:21.733 --> 16:22.932
I'm in the it gets worse
before it gets better phase.

16:22.934 --> 16:23.867
No, no you're fine,

16:23.869 --> 16:24.868
I just, the library is hiring,

16:24.870 --> 16:26.639
I wanted to drop
off my resume to

16:27.505 --> 16:30.373
a corporeal entity if possible.

16:30.375 --> 16:32.276
- Good word. Corporeal.
- Thank you.

16:32.278 --> 16:33.776
And antipathy, you
said that earlier.

16:33.778 --> 16:35.411
Yeah that's one of my
go-to smart people words.

16:35.413 --> 16:36.512
It's your smart people what?

16:36.514 --> 16:39.382
You know that handful
of words that you overuse

16:39.384 --> 16:40.684
in conversations to
impress strangers

16:40.686 --> 16:42.486
even if they don't
really fit like,

16:42.488 --> 16:44.757
my worst offenders are
emblematic and perspicacity.

16:45.923 --> 16:47.690
You don't do that do you?

16:47.692 --> 16:48.624
I'm sorry, ignore me,

16:48.626 --> 16:49.895
I am pretentious apparently.

16:51.462 --> 16:52.628
My middle name is pretentious.

16:52.630 --> 16:54.363
- What?
- So we're even Steven.

16:54.365 --> 16:55.299
Is that a joke?

16:55.301 --> 16:57.534
Like danger is my middle name.

16:57.536 --> 16:59.636
No my middle name is Preston.

16:59.638 --> 17:02.571
It's a pretentious name,
I'm trying to relate to you.

17:02.573 --> 17:04.507
Right. Preston is pretentious.

17:04.509 --> 17:05.675
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

17:05.678 --> 17:07.847
Some would say that
it is Prestontious.

17:09.381 --> 17:10.546
Would they?

17:10.548 --> 17:11.818
If it's a joke yeah.

17:12.818 --> 17:13.654
Copy.

17:14.721 --> 17:15.752
My first name is Todd.

17:15.753 --> 17:16.756
Hi Todd, I'm Rory.

17:17.955 --> 17:19.356
- I like that name.
- Thank you.

17:19.358 --> 17:20.691
It reminds me of Rory Gilmore.

17:20.693 --> 17:21.625
You watch "Gilmore Girls"?

17:21.627 --> 17:22.492
I watch "Gilmore Girls",

17:22.494 --> 17:23.861
I own all the seven
seasons on DVD.

17:23.863 --> 17:25.095
I own all seven
seasons on DVD.

17:25.097 --> 17:26.497
I almost went to Yale
because of that show.

17:26.499 --> 17:27.731
I almost went to Yale
because of the show.

17:27.733 --> 17:29.336
- I didn't get in obviously.
- I did.

17:30.502 --> 17:31.571
That sucks I'm sorry.

17:32.606 --> 17:35.073
Oh, favorite Rory boyfriend
on one, two, three

17:35.075 --> 17:36.708
- Jesse.
- Jesse obviously.

17:36.710 --> 17:37.643
Do you think I'm gay?

17:37.645 --> 17:38.677
- Pardon?
- One can like "Gilmore Girls"

17:38.679 --> 17:39.678
- and be not gay.
- I wasn't assuming anything.

17:39.680 --> 17:40.881
Okay because both my
friends think I'm gay,

17:41.914 --> 17:43.581
so I didn't want you to, last
week I had sex with a girl.

17:43.583 --> 17:45.682
Well woman, well girl.

17:45.684 --> 17:46.883
Good for you.

17:46.885 --> 17:48.118
Sorry I don't know
why I said that.

17:48.120 --> 17:49.554
I'm not bragging I
only got my hand in.

17:49.556 --> 17:50.354
Not because she
was gay or I'm gay

17:50.356 --> 17:51.588
because she was a virgin

17:51.590 --> 17:52.690
- and then I just...
- No it's fine,

17:52.692 --> 17:54.624
- really I believe you.
- Oh. I just didn't want you

17:54.626 --> 17:55.660
to label me so.

17:55.662 --> 17:57.127
I don't, labels are for vegans

17:57.129 --> 17:58.363
as I sometimes say.

17:58.365 --> 17:59.765
I eat meat.

17:59.767 --> 18:01.799
I, you know, feel
bad for the animals.

18:01.801 --> 18:04.536
I prefer to eat smaller
animals like chickens,

18:04.538 --> 18:05.738
because the smaller
you are the less likely

18:05.740 --> 18:06.572
you are to feel pain.

18:06.574 --> 18:07.772
I didn't know that.

18:07.774 --> 18:09.607
Might not be true I haven't
looked into it thoroughly.

18:09.609 --> 18:11.545
I already have a lot of
guilt on my plate so.

18:15.383 --> 18:16.017
- Hm?
- What?

18:17.050 --> 18:19.817
Oh nothing I just,

18:19.819 --> 18:21.955
I thought maybe you wanted
to ask me something.

18:23.656 --> 18:24.722
So you said you're an actress,

18:24.724 --> 18:25.923
have I seen you in anything?

18:25.925 --> 18:27.692
Maybe have you
seen "2 Girls 1 Cup"?

18:27.694 --> 18:28.826
No when did it come out?

18:28.828 --> 18:30.128
Oh I'm just kidding sorry,

18:30.130 --> 18:31.529
I hate that question.

18:31.531 --> 18:32.597
When did it come out?

18:32.599 --> 18:33.531
No have I seen
you in anything?

18:33.533 --> 18:34.833
Because like you haven't,

18:34.835 --> 18:36.734
but anyway it's a porn video.

18:36.736 --> 18:37.670
You were in a porn video?

18:37.672 --> 18:39.738
No, no, no, "2 Girls
1 Cup' is a porn,

18:39.740 --> 18:41.406
you've never really?

18:41.408 --> 18:42.807
Oh well it's two girls,

18:42.809 --> 18:45.109
and then they shit into a cup,

18:45.111 --> 18:46.577
- it's really gross.
- Oh no,

18:46.579 --> 18:47.614
- yeah if you could, no, just
- I'm sorry,

18:47.616 --> 18:48.882
- change, I'm a visual person.
- Oh, oh let me...

18:48.884 --> 18:50.048
Change the topic

18:50.050 --> 18:50.716
- please yeah.
- Okay sure great,

18:50.718 --> 18:51.651
what do you do?

18:51.653 --> 18:52.818
Well I get intrusive thoughts,

18:52.820 --> 18:53.920
so I keep replaying that imagery

18:53.922 --> 18:55.555
- over and over in my head.
- No, no, no, for work,

18:55.557 --> 18:57.156
for work, for work, for
work, what do you do?

18:57.158 --> 19:00.193
Software coding and I
house sit as a side hobby

19:00.195 --> 19:02.628
but mostly just to meet people.

19:02.630 --> 19:03.863
Who do you meet house sitting?

19:03.865 --> 19:06.732
The owners before they leave.

19:06.734 --> 19:09.935
Oh. Whose house is this?

19:09.937 --> 19:13.839
My first cousin once removed
chiropractor's ex-wife.

19:13.841 --> 19:14.840
And what does she do?

19:14.842 --> 19:17.477
I didn't ask, you have
a very symmetrical face.

19:17.479 --> 19:18.545
- Thank you.
- I'm developing an app

19:18.547 --> 19:20.480
called Face Value that
leverages machine learning

19:20.482 --> 19:21.780
to measure facial
bilateral symmetry

19:21.782 --> 19:22.781
on a scale of one to 10.

19:22.783 --> 19:24.616
You can tell a lot about
a person by their face.

19:24.618 --> 19:25.684
Yeah what does my face say?

19:25.686 --> 19:26.719
Oh I'm glad you asked.

19:26.721 --> 19:27.987
Facial symmetry indicates

19:27.989 --> 19:29.154
- extraversion,
- Sometimes.

19:29.156 --> 19:30.789
- Lower levels of neuroticism,
- Nope.

19:30.791 --> 19:33.058
- And developmental stability.
- Definitely not.

19:33.060 --> 19:34.661
It's true, they've
done studies.

19:34.663 --> 19:37.764
Ah yeah well to
invalidate that research,

19:37.766 --> 19:38.699
I don't have a dad,

19:38.701 --> 19:39.867
my mom was, she still is,

19:39.869 --> 19:41.100
a surgeon for doctor's
without boarders

19:41.102 --> 19:42.470
so she was always gone

19:42.472 --> 19:43.703
and my brother
basically raised me.

19:43.705 --> 19:44.972
Except he got
addicted to heroin,

19:44.974 --> 19:46.607
he stole a bunch of
money from my nana,

19:46.609 --> 19:49.175
we kinda don't talk anymore,
it's a bit fucked up.

19:49.177 --> 19:50.543
Why am I telling you this?

19:50.545 --> 19:52.213
I don't know.

19:52.215 --> 19:54.682
I do. I have a theory

19:54.684 --> 19:55.649
that millennials over share

19:55.651 --> 19:57.851
because we're the most
godless generation.

19:57.853 --> 19:59.953
So that's why we confess
everything on social media,

19:59.955 --> 20:02.923
it's sort of our way to cling
to some kind of permanence.

20:02.925 --> 20:04.058
Are you on social media?

20:04.060 --> 20:05.928
- No are you?
- No.

20:07.730 --> 20:10.697
Well it's just a theory.

20:10.699 --> 20:12.665
- Oh I see it now.
- What?

20:12.667 --> 20:15.069
Your drug addict
brother, he's right...

20:15.071 --> 20:16.736
So what's your face value?

20:16.738 --> 20:17.637
Six point two.

20:17.639 --> 20:19.572
- That doesn't sound good.
- It's not.

20:19.574 --> 20:20.773
I have a deviated septum,

20:20.775 --> 20:22.041
a triangle of
moles on this side,

20:22.043 --> 20:23.480
and then only one dimple.

20:24.180 --> 20:25.780
That's ironic you know?

20:25.782 --> 20:27.081
Guy obsessed with
symmetry has crooked face.

20:27.083 --> 20:28.183
You must hate yourself.

20:28.185 --> 20:30.150
Yeah most of the time.

20:30.152 --> 20:31.752
Oh no I didn't mean, no.

20:31.754 --> 20:32.887
Don't, I'm just
fucking with you,

20:32.889 --> 20:34.723
don't hate yourself, that's sad.

20:34.725 --> 20:35.760
Okay.

20:36.659 --> 20:39.560
So you're legit OCD right?

20:39.562 --> 20:40.662
You're not just like,

20:40.664 --> 20:43.865
"Oh I'm so OCD I save the
red skittles for last."?

20:43.867 --> 20:45.133
Oh I do save the
red skittles for last.

20:45.135 --> 20:46.902
- Oh.
- But I'm also a checker

20:46.904 --> 20:48.736
and a washer and I don't fly.

20:48.738 --> 20:50.571
You don't fly, how
do you get anywhere?

20:50.573 --> 20:51.875
I don't need to go anywhere.

20:52.876 --> 20:54.775
- Paris?
- Small fridges.

20:54.777 --> 20:56.043
- New York?
- I can drive to New York.

20:56.045 --> 20:57.545
- Have you?
- No but I've seen

20:57.547 --> 21:00.281
"Taxi Driver" and "Cloverfield"
so I get the idea.

21:00.283 --> 21:03.318
You know driving is way more
dangerous than flying right?

21:03.320 --> 21:04.655
Not the way I drive.

21:05.789 --> 21:06.987
Do you see a psychiatrist?

21:06.989 --> 21:08.790
Yes but mostly I
see a psychoanalyst

21:08.792 --> 21:09.791
because I like to talk a lot,

21:09.793 --> 21:11.193
and I used to do cognitive
behavioral therapy

21:11.195 --> 21:12.695
to help with my phobias.

21:12.697 --> 21:13.795
What are you afraid of?

21:13.797 --> 21:15.263
Everything under the sun.

21:15.265 --> 21:17.832
- The sun.
- You're afraid of the sun?

21:17.834 --> 21:19.301
Yeah I try to avoid it.

21:19.303 --> 21:20.703
Especially during the hours
of 10 a.m. and four p.m.

21:20.705 --> 21:21.838
when the UV rays
are the most potent

21:21.840 --> 21:23.705
because I'm afraid it's
going to expedite my cancer.

21:23.707 --> 21:24.840
Oh wait, you have cancer?

21:24.842 --> 21:26.775
Oh not yet. But I will.

21:26.777 --> 21:27.909
- You will?
- Uh-huh.

21:27.911 --> 21:29.678
There's a 44% chance
that I'll develop

21:29.680 --> 21:31.280
some form of cancer
throughout my lifetime

21:31.282 --> 21:33.616
and I've never been
exceptionally lucky.

21:33.618 --> 21:35.618
But you need serotonin.

21:35.620 --> 21:37.086
Sunlight's good for your soul.

21:37.088 --> 21:38.821
I know, I don't get enough

21:38.823 --> 21:40.222
and it stresses me
out and the worst part

21:40.224 --> 21:42.692
is that stress causes cancer.

21:42.694 --> 21:43.826
It's a vicious cycle.

21:43.828 --> 21:45.261
It really is.

21:45.263 --> 21:48.863
So are you afraid
of dying too soon

21:48.865 --> 21:50.032
or just dying in general?

21:50.034 --> 21:52.334
The latter, I
don't wanna die ever.

21:52.336 --> 21:53.636
Oh see I'm the opposite,

21:53.638 --> 21:54.971
I already know how I wanna die.

21:54.973 --> 21:58.139
I am 90 and I just
won my second Oscar,

21:58.141 --> 22:00.877
I used to say third but I
don't wanna be unrealistic,

22:00.879 --> 22:03.312
and I fall asleep
hugging a panda

22:03.314 --> 22:05.148
and then she falls asleep

22:05.150 --> 22:07.283
and then she rolls over and
accidentally smothers me.

22:07.285 --> 22:08.985
- Well that sounds nice.
- But I can understand,

22:08.987 --> 22:10.720
I can understand not
wanting to die prematurely,

22:10.722 --> 22:13.322
'cause like if I died now
before I've done anything

22:13.324 --> 22:16.360
you know like, significant,
I would be livid.

22:16.362 --> 22:17.727
Well I doubt many people would

22:17.729 --> 22:18.928
be jumping in
their boots to die.

22:18.930 --> 22:19.862
Like happy people.

22:19.864 --> 22:21.130
Except for suicidal people.

22:21.132 --> 22:22.399
I don't hang out
with those people.

22:22.401 --> 22:23.065
But they're probably
not the jumping type.

22:23.067 --> 22:24.301
I know some.

22:24.303 --> 22:25.235
Unless it's off of
a bridge or something.

22:25.237 --> 22:26.168
But seriously if I died now

22:26.170 --> 22:27.337
I would literally kill somebody.

22:27.339 --> 22:30.172
- Literally?
- Well no, oh no!

22:30.174 --> 22:32.109
Oh God, that's one of
my biggest pet peeves.

22:32.111 --> 22:33.776
I can't believe I just fucking
did that.

22:33.778 --> 22:35.012
Well they say that
things you don't like

22:35.014 --> 22:36.245
about other people
are usually problems

22:36.247 --> 22:37.648
that you have with yourself.

22:37.650 --> 22:39.116
Okay first of
all, who says that?

22:39.118 --> 22:40.350
Nobody says that, that is rude.

22:40.352 --> 22:42.886
Second of all I
did mean literally.

22:42.888 --> 22:45.322
What you'd literally
kill somebody?

22:45.324 --> 22:47.792
To be not dead? Yeah.

22:47.794 --> 22:48.959
Like I'm not saying I'd go out

22:48.961 --> 22:50.727
and sign up to be a terrorist,

22:50.729 --> 22:52.030
but if somebody put a gun
to my head and they said,

22:52.032 --> 22:53.831
"Hey kill that guy or
I'm gonna kill you."

22:53.833 --> 22:54.931
I'd be like, "Hey sorry man,

22:54.933 --> 22:56.737
"I gotta lookout
for number one."

22:57.437 --> 22:58.369
No matter who it was?

22:58.371 --> 23:00.438
Well maybe if it was like,

23:00.440 --> 23:01.406
no, I'd let Obama die.

23:01.408 --> 23:03.240
- Your parents?
- They've had their time.

23:03.242 --> 23:04.875
- A baby?
- I would definitely

23:04.877 --> 23:05.909
- kill a baby.
- What?

23:05.911 --> 23:07.411
Oh come on,

23:07.413 --> 23:08.912
think about how much time
and investment goes into

23:08.914 --> 23:10.214
raising a well adjusted adult.

23:10.216 --> 23:11.785
I am college educated,

23:12.719 --> 23:14.185
I have a great sense of humor,

23:14.187 --> 23:16.187
I'm going to be
a famous actress,

23:16.189 --> 23:18.322
I am way more beneficial
to society than a

23:18.324 --> 23:20.691
useless,
resource-consuming baby.

23:20.693 --> 23:21.692
- Wow.
- It would be like

23:21.694 --> 23:23.761
painting the Mona Lisa
white to start fresh.

23:23.763 --> 23:25.228
What if that baby
was the next Picasso?

23:25.230 --> 23:27.732
Or a more likely scenario,

23:27.734 --> 23:29.934
what if he was a gangbanger?

23:29.936 --> 23:33.236
Or a heroin addict or just had
a real crooked face like you?

23:33.238 --> 23:34.707
I'm joking, Todd I'm joking.

23:34.709 --> 23:36.808
I'm sorry you're really easy.

23:36.810 --> 23:38.310
No I just, it's the same
reason I don't wanna have kids.

23:38.312 --> 23:39.911
I figure Murphy's
law if I had kids

23:39.913 --> 23:41.345
I'd probably end up
like the mother in

23:41.347 --> 23:43.347
"We Need to Talk About Kevin".

23:43.349 --> 23:44.882
Oh I though that was
gonna be one of those movies

23:44.884 --> 23:46.785
where they say the title
somewhere in the dialogue,

23:46.787 --> 23:48.053
and I kept waiting
for it to happen

23:48.055 --> 23:50.057
and it never did and
it really bothered me.

23:51.025 --> 23:52.324
Not the massacre itself,

23:52.326 --> 23:53.292
just the fact that
nobody ever said,

23:53.294 --> 23:54.293
we need to talk about Kevin?

23:54.295 --> 23:56.163
Yeah, it just wasn't right.

23:57.864 --> 23:59.398
My mom wants me to have kids.

23:59.400 --> 24:01.833
She wants me to have
kids and she wants me

24:01.835 --> 24:03.368
to save the planet and I'm like,

24:03.370 --> 24:06.839
"Fuck can I just do
what makes me happy?"

24:06.841 --> 24:08.907
You know like isn't
that why our forefathers

24:08.909 --> 24:10.843
bombed and pillaged
other countries

24:10.845 --> 24:12.844
so that I could be happy?

24:12.846 --> 24:15.881
And as much as I
pretend to give no fucks

24:15.883 --> 24:17.416
what my mother
things invariably,

24:17.418 --> 24:19.817
the only way that I can
justify being an actor,

24:19.819 --> 24:21.987
which is like the
epitome of vanity,

24:21.989 --> 24:23.890
is to be a disgustingly
rich philanthropist

24:23.892 --> 24:26.492
like Paul Newman and trying
to be Paul Newman all the time

24:26.494 --> 24:29.161
is way too much pressure.

24:29.163 --> 24:30.896
Tell me about it.

24:30.898 --> 24:33.034
What would you do,
would you shoot the baby?

24:34.068 --> 24:36.769
- I'd shoot the baby.
- Thank you.

24:36.771 --> 24:38.470
But if it was you or me,

24:38.472 --> 24:39.407
I'd shoot me.

24:44.546 --> 24:45.844
Hey, are you okay?

24:45.846 --> 24:47.348
Yeah sorry,

24:49.017 --> 24:50.350
it's just the wine and the cake

24:50.352 --> 24:53.419
and we've been talking
for eight hours.

24:53.421 --> 24:54.921
Why are you so nice?

24:54.923 --> 24:56.322
- Oh I'm not that nice.
- Yes you are.

24:56.324 --> 24:57.524
No I'm not.

24:57.526 --> 24:58.792
You're the nicest
person in L.A.

24:58.794 --> 24:59.826
Really I'm not.

24:59.828 --> 25:01.126
I lie to homeless people,
I always have change

25:01.128 --> 25:02.764
I just don't give it to them.

25:05.133 --> 25:06.799
I think I'm depressed.

25:06.801 --> 25:08.803
Well that's okay.
I'm depressed too.

25:11.307 --> 25:12.308
I should lie down.

25:14.343 --> 25:16.513
Well if you feel like
you're gonna throw up,

25:17.579 --> 25:19.215
- don't.
- Okay.

25:23.318 --> 25:24.820
I don't know why I'm here.

25:27.889 --> 25:29.925
I don't mean existentially,
specifically L.A.

25:31.527 --> 25:33.896
I hate meeting people.

25:35.231 --> 25:36.329
"So what do you do?"

25:36.331 --> 25:39.066
"I'm an actress." "Oh have
I seen you in anything?"

25:39.068 --> 25:39.767
"Oohh"

25:39.769 --> 25:42.506
Go fuck yourself, no offense.

25:44.106 --> 25:48.041
I usually lie and say I'm a
geospatial analyst or something

25:48.043 --> 25:50.044
because the truth is, and I know

25:50.046 --> 25:51.945
I know that all
yuppies are miserable

25:51.947 --> 25:53.614
because we have these
chimerical expectations

25:53.616 --> 25:55.548
that that will inevitably
falter to reality

25:55.550 --> 25:57.351
because we can't
accept that we are not

25:57.353 --> 25:58.352
as special as we think we are.

25:58.354 --> 26:01.155
But I don't care about
them. I care about me

26:01.157 --> 26:02.891
and I was valedictorian
in high school.

26:02.893 --> 26:04.192
Which shouldn't mean
anything except that it does,

26:04.194 --> 26:06.427
it means I was better
than 87 other people,

26:06.429 --> 26:07.628
small private school.

26:07.630 --> 26:11.199
You know I honestly thought
that I would be an outlier,

26:11.201 --> 26:12.867
like that Malcolm
Gladwell book "Outliers"

26:12.869 --> 26:14.301
that I read at the
Starbucks across from CAA,

26:14.303 --> 26:16.938
but nothing ever fucking
manifests and I'm already old!

26:16.940 --> 26:18.339
When did that happen?

26:18.341 --> 26:19.641
And I know that they say

26:19.643 --> 26:22.042
it's who you know or
rather who knows you,

26:22.044 --> 26:23.979
but nobody knows me,
nobody really knows me

26:23.981 --> 26:25.413
and I keep going
out for these stupid

26:25.415 --> 26:27.548
fucking student films where
everything is a dream,

26:27.550 --> 26:28.616
and I don't even get a callback

26:28.618 --> 26:29.951
and I didn't even want it anyway

26:29.953 --> 26:30.618
and I must be dreaming,

26:30.620 --> 26:31.552
I must be dreaming!

26:31.554 --> 26:33.020
I must be out of my fucking mind

26:33.022 --> 26:35.158
and I am so poor!

26:37.159 --> 26:38.326
But you're a great actress.

26:38.328 --> 26:39.594
You've never even see me act.

26:39.596 --> 26:41.496
Oh yeah that's true.

26:41.498 --> 26:43.097
But I can just tell I mean,

26:43.099 --> 26:44.932
you're smart and you're funny

26:44.934 --> 26:48.170
and you're clean and
that's all you need.

26:48.172 --> 26:50.539
- Oh stop it.
- No really,

26:50.541 --> 26:52.575
you've a start personality.

26:52.577 --> 26:55.110
You're like Katherine Hepburn.

26:56.915 --> 26:59.347
"The stage is really life
buster ha, ha, ha, ha."

26:59.349 --> 27:00.950
That was really good.

27:00.952 --> 27:03.955
Thanks.

27:12.664 --> 27:13.999
Can I hold your hand?

28:00.646 --> 28:02.546
Hi
you've reached Todd.

28:02.548 --> 28:04.647
I'm sorry I missed you but
please leave your name,

28:04.649 --> 28:06.582
number, time and date
you called in that order,

28:06.584 --> 28:08.752
followed by any other
pertinent information

28:08.754 --> 28:11.655
and I will get to you as
soon as reasonably possible.

28:11.657 --> 28:16.659
Hi it's Rory, my
number is 206-377-2616,

28:16.661 --> 28:20.329
it's like two thirtyish
on a Wednesday,

28:20.331 --> 28:23.501
and I, sorry I have
another call hold on.

28:23.503 --> 28:24.972
Oh it's you okay,

28:26.039 --> 28:27.538
I'll talk to you in a second.

28:27.540 --> 28:29.540
- Hello?
- Hi you called?

28:29.542 --> 28:31.208
You called first.

28:31.210 --> 28:32.743
Oh right, you're
still unemployed?

28:32.745 --> 28:35.379
There must have been a gentler
way to phrase that but yes.

28:35.381 --> 28:37.348
Good, so a friend of
one of my clients asked me

28:37.350 --> 28:39.216
to house-sit for her while
she's vacationing in Europe

28:39.218 --> 28:40.650
but it's a bit of a
drive so I wanted to see

28:40.652 --> 28:41.519
if you were available.

28:41.521 --> 28:43.454
- She's driving to Europe?
- No what?

28:43.456 --> 28:44.554
- You lost me.
- I'm house sitting

28:44.556 --> 28:46.456
- in Monterey.
- Oh.

28:46.458 --> 28:47.692
But I can't drive
for that long by myself

28:47.694 --> 28:49.426
or I'll asleep and
die so I wanted to see

28:49.428 --> 28:50.695
if you'd be interested
in joining me?

28:50.697 --> 28:52.295
I'll pay you.

28:52.297 --> 28:53.531
- Okay.
- Yeah?

28:53.533 --> 28:56.203
I didn't know if you could get
away with auditions and all.

28:57.669 --> 29:00.070
Wait why wouldn't she just
hire someone more local?

29:00.072 --> 29:02.740
I organize closets, I
have great references.

29:02.742 --> 29:03.808
Of course you do.

29:03.810 --> 29:04.742
The only thing is,

29:04.744 --> 29:06.444
how do you feel about dogs?

29:06.446 --> 29:07.677
- Dogs?
- Yes dogs,

29:07.679 --> 29:09.280
I normally adhere to a
strict no pets policy,

29:09.282 --> 29:11.082
but if you're with me
I could be persuaded.

29:11.084 --> 29:12.618
The deal-breaker is
that you have to be

29:12.620 --> 29:13.519
the poop picker-upper.

29:13.521 --> 29:14.453
Stop.

29:14.455 --> 29:16.588
You had me at 'I'll pay you.'

30:26.260 --> 30:27.659
Okay are you ready?

30:27.661 --> 30:29.228
- I think so.
- Okay and you have to look

30:29.230 --> 30:31.197
right at me and keep
a straight face.

30:31.199 --> 30:32.398
- Okay.
- And no frowning

30:32.400 --> 30:33.899
- 'cause that's cheating okay?
- Okay.

30:33.901 --> 30:39.107
Okay

30:41.575 --> 30:42.675
Baby!

30:42.677 --> 30:44.677
Oh come on man!

30:44.679 --> 30:46.450
You didn't even let me finish.

30:47.749 --> 30:50.287
You suck. Okay your turn.

30:51.219 --> 30:52.253
What's the line again?

30:52.255 --> 30:53.419
Baby if you love me,

30:53.421 --> 30:55.191
won't you please
just give me a smile?

30:59.428 --> 31:00.727
Baby if you love me,

31:00.729 --> 31:03.264
won't you please
just give me a smile?

31:03.266 --> 31:05.632
Baby I love you but
I just can't smile.

31:05.634 --> 31:07.200
Weak, weak choice.

31:07.202 --> 31:08.738
Okay, okay.

31:10.706 --> 31:14.874
Baby if you love me, won't you
please just give me a smile?

31:14.876 --> 31:16.442
Baby I love you but
I just can't smile,

31:16.444 --> 31:17.777
what the fuck was that?

31:17.779 --> 31:19.580
- Are you trying?
- I am trying,

31:19.582 --> 31:20.547
I'm just not good at this game.

31:20.549 --> 31:21.782
It's because
you're self-conscious.

31:21.784 --> 31:23.683
Look if you wanna make me smile,

31:23.685 --> 31:25.652
you have to humiliate
yourself in a way

31:25.654 --> 31:27.755
that isn't like
cute or endearing.

31:27.757 --> 31:29.359
Have ugly, will travel.

31:32.627 --> 31:36.564
Okay.

31:36.566 --> 31:41.538
Baby if you love me, won't you
please just give me a smile?

31:42.306 --> 31:44.471
Yes? Huh, yeah, yeah?

31:44.473 --> 31:45.940
Ah that was a smile.

31:45.942 --> 31:49.312
Ah I win!

31:50.980 --> 31:53.515
You didn't smile on
purpose, did you?

31:53.517 --> 31:55.850
I don't know, I
don't know maybe.

31:55.852 --> 31:56.921
Okay.

31:59.556 --> 32:04.562
Baby if you love
me, won't you please

32:05.495 --> 32:09.800
just give me a smile?

32:11.535 --> 32:13.504
Baby I love you

32:15.404 --> 32:17.407
but I just can't smile.

32:41.965 --> 32:44.602
Do you wanna be my girlfriend?

32:49.641 --> 32:50.442
Hi.

32:51.942 --> 32:54.277
Rory I'm so glad to
finally meet you,

32:54.279 --> 32:56.679
Todd has been MIA forever.

32:56.681 --> 32:57.779
- Three months.
- Yeah that's like

32:57.781 --> 32:59.748
24 months in bitch years,

32:59.750 --> 33:01.683
and you didn't tell me
that Rory's so pretty.

33:01.685 --> 33:04.854
Oh thank you. I mean
you look like a model.

33:04.856 --> 33:06.055
I am a model.

33:06.057 --> 33:08.460
You clearly haven't
heard anything about me.

33:10.428 --> 33:12.764
And this is my boo Zane.

33:13.898 --> 33:16.633
He's also a model
but mostly underwear.

33:16.635 --> 33:19.736
- Hi Zane.
- So updates, give, give.

33:19.738 --> 33:21.872
Well we just got
back from San Diego.

33:21.874 --> 33:23.573
- Professional house sitters.
- Ah. Bangin'.

33:23.575 --> 33:26.710
Zane's from London.
Note the vernacular.

33:26.712 --> 33:29.046
We also sit dogs, no cats.

33:29.048 --> 33:30.614
I'm allergic, she
just hates them.

33:30.616 --> 33:31.615
- I do.
- We should tell Danny

33:31.617 --> 33:32.716
for the holidays.

33:32.718 --> 33:34.050
- He's got that tiny wiener.
- Okay enough business.

33:34.052 --> 33:36.952
Rory how did you two meet?

33:36.954 --> 33:38.387
Well it's kind of funny,

33:38.389 --> 33:39.323
actually Todd do
you wanna tell it?

33:39.325 --> 33:40.022
Well you tell it better.

33:40.024 --> 33:42.326
Stop I love already.

33:42.328 --> 33:44.361
We met in the self-help
section at the library.

33:44.363 --> 33:46.529
He was stocking shelves, so
I thought he worked there

33:46.531 --> 33:47.631
and I was looking for a job.

33:47.633 --> 33:49.665
Aww but you found him instead.

33:49.667 --> 33:51.536
So cute. All of it.

33:52.671 --> 33:53.836
How did you and Zane meet?

33:53.838 --> 33:55.508
- Mutual friends.
- Group sex party.

34:01.981 --> 34:04.615
Rory what do you do?

34:04.617 --> 34:06.384
I'm a geospatial analyst.

34:06.386 --> 34:07.952
She's an actress.

34:07.954 --> 34:10.554
Well I totally believed you.

34:10.556 --> 34:11.456
Do you have an agent?

34:11.458 --> 34:12.989
Should I get one,
are they helpful?

34:12.991 --> 34:14.692
- Oh my God yes.
- You can't book anything

34:14.694 --> 34:16.693
- without one.
- I know sorry I'm looking.

34:16.695 --> 34:17.594
Is anyone getting food?

34:17.596 --> 34:19.797
Oh we're on a cleanse
but you should try

34:19.799 --> 34:21.465
their artisan flatbread.

34:21.467 --> 34:22.967
My treat. I just wanna smell it.

34:22.969 --> 34:24.802
Oh we shouldn't we're
having a pizza tomorrow night.

34:24.804 --> 34:26.637
- Can we do that Thursday?
- Well we're making

34:26.639 --> 34:27.572
- Mongolian Thursday.
- Right, right.

34:27.574 --> 34:29.672
You plan out all your
suppers in advance.

34:29.675 --> 34:30.907
Well it's our Doc night.

34:30.909 --> 34:33.643
Doc night, is that
some role play thing?

34:33.645 --> 34:35.579
I enjoy spanking.

34:35.581 --> 34:36.880
Every Thursday we
watch a documentary

34:36.882 --> 34:38.815
to keep our relationship
cognitively stimulating.

34:38.817 --> 34:39.751
This Thursday we're watching

34:39.753 --> 34:41.451
"The Story of the Weeping Camel"

34:41.453 --> 34:42.820
because it's set in Mongolia
so we thought it'd be ironic

34:42.822 --> 34:44.121
if we were eating Mongolian.

34:44.123 --> 34:45.590
Well it
wouldn't be ironic.

34:45.592 --> 34:47.493
It would be ironic if
we were eating camel.

34:47.495 --> 34:48.726
I don't think that
Whole Foods sells camel.

34:48.728 --> 34:50.062
- Was that a joke?
- Was it not funny?

34:50.063 --> 34:51.763
- It was okay.
- Scale of one to six?

34:51.764 --> 34:53.766
Who scales one to six?

34:56.603 --> 34:57.935
Oh my God, who are
you dressing up as

34:57.937 --> 34:59.171
for Ryder's birthday party?

34:59.173 --> 35:00.606
Ryder's having
a birthday party?

35:00.608 --> 35:02.807
Yeah the theme is
iconic movie couples.

35:02.809 --> 35:04.443
I thought you'd be on the
at like Asian on rice.

35:04.445 --> 35:05.477
Didn't you get the Evite?

35:05.479 --> 35:06.644
White on rice.

35:06.646 --> 35:08.513
Yeah but don't
Asians eat more rice?

35:08.515 --> 35:09.647
I didn't get the Evite.

35:09.649 --> 35:11.950
Oh well you know
Ryder, he's fag-get-ful.

35:11.952 --> 35:13.718
Are you making
fun of my accent?

35:13.720 --> 35:17.122
Oh no I'm saying
he's fag-get-ful,

35:17.124 --> 35:19.591
because he's a fag
who's forgetful.

35:19.593 --> 35:21.660
You can't say fag in America.

35:21.662 --> 35:22.727
Well Todd made it up.

35:22.729 --> 35:23.861
- Is that right Todd?
- No I...

35:23.863 --> 35:25.930
Anyway you have to come.

35:25.932 --> 35:27.732
Plus Marcus Stafford
will be there,

35:27.734 --> 35:30.836
and he would be a perect
talent manager for Rory.

35:30.838 --> 35:32.571
- Really?
- Yeah!

35:32.573 --> 35:34.741
I mean he's always saying
that his clients are shit

35:34.743 --> 35:36.576
but I'm sure he would love you.

35:36.578 --> 35:37.911
Fucking A, I feel like

35:37.913 --> 35:39.945
Sandra Bullock in
"The Blind Side".

35:39.947 --> 35:41.549
Making dreams come true.

35:44.453 --> 35:46.018
We need to go home, I
think I left the toaster on.

35:46.020 --> 35:46.953
You didn't leave
the toaster on.

35:46.955 --> 35:47.920
We could go home and play

35:47.922 --> 35:48.822
The Game of Life and
turn off the toaster.

35:48.824 --> 35:49.922
We're never playing
that game again,

35:49.924 --> 35:51.623
you get too emotional also
the toasters always off

35:51.625 --> 35:52.491
unless you put toast in it.

35:52.493 --> 35:53.393
You don't put
toast in a toaster.

35:53.395 --> 35:54.092
- I meant bread.
- Well you said toast.

35:54.094 --> 35:55.094
You know what I meant Todd.

35:55.096 --> 35:56.996
The toaster is always
on unless you unplug it,

35:56.998 --> 35:57.896
and I forgot to
unplug it so it's on.

35:57.898 --> 35:59.532
You do not forget
to unplug things,

35:59.534 --> 36:00.967
so either you're being paranoid

36:00.969 --> 36:02.201
or you're making up excuses
to avoid going inside.

36:02.203 --> 36:03.969
Both are scenarios I
refuse to accommodate.

36:03.971 --> 36:05.637
Okay fine but if you get
bored and you wanna leave,

36:05.639 --> 36:06.505
just use the safe word.

36:06.507 --> 36:07.706
- What's the safe word?
- I don't know,

36:07.708 --> 36:08.708
we haven't picked one yet.

36:08.710 --> 36:09.842
How about snollygoster?

36:09.844 --> 36:11.043
It's not very discreet,

36:11.045 --> 36:12.212
how would I slip
it into a sentence?

36:12.214 --> 36:13.545
Honey have you
seen my snollygoster?

36:13.547 --> 36:14.514
What's a snollygoster?

36:14.516 --> 36:16.752
You're right, people
will ask questions.

36:18.085 --> 36:19.652
I'm just saying
how funny would it have been

36:19.654 --> 36:20.987
if "The Fifth Element"
had been dick?

36:23.059 --> 36:24.825
Oh my God. Todd.

36:24.827 --> 36:26.059
Ryder. Happy birthday.

36:26.061 --> 36:27.660
It has been so long,

36:27.662 --> 36:29.698
I think I thought you were dead.

36:30.765 --> 36:32.066
And you must be Rory.

36:32.068 --> 36:33.600
Hi nice to meet you.

36:33.602 --> 36:35.769
- You're Todd's girlfriend.
- Yes.

36:35.771 --> 36:37.671
How is that going?

36:37.673 --> 36:38.606
It's a ball.

36:38.608 --> 36:40.039
Super. Is that for me?

36:40.041 --> 36:41.608
It is yeah, Todd
picked it out.

36:41.610 --> 36:42.510
It's from Crate and Barrel.

36:42.512 --> 36:43.744
Don't tell him that.

36:43.746 --> 36:44.745
It's not from
Crate and Barrel.

36:44.747 --> 36:45.678
If you don't like it,
there's a gift receipt.

36:45.680 --> 36:46.245
You know what?

36:46.247 --> 36:47.680
I bet I'm gonna love it,

36:47.682 --> 36:48.282
because our Todd here
has the aesthetic taste

36:48.284 --> 36:49.950
of a well-oiled woman.

36:49.952 --> 36:52.519
- Where should I put it?
- That's what Todd said.

36:52.521 --> 36:53.720
The guest bedroom
is down the hall,

36:53.722 --> 36:54.787
it's the second
door on your right.

36:54.789 --> 36:55.624
Okay.

36:57.559 --> 36:58.291
You're fine.

36:58.293 --> 36:59.959
Oh okay, yeah I'm fine.

36:59.961 --> 37:02.162
Okay so like
she's in on it then?

37:02.164 --> 37:03.763
In on what?

37:03.765 --> 37:05.865
You're Paul Newman in
"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof".

37:05.867 --> 37:06.934
Oh you got it, we were worried

37:06.936 --> 37:08.669
nobody would recognize us.

37:08.671 --> 37:12.674
Oh God Todd, you must
know that he was gay right?

37:12.676 --> 37:13.875
Paul Newman? No he's not.

37:13.877 --> 37:16.877
His character, his
character was gay.

37:16.879 --> 37:19.080
That's why they
never had any sex.

37:19.082 --> 37:21.148
I didn't pick
up on that at all.

37:21.150 --> 37:22.951
I think you just see
subliminal homosexuality

37:22.953 --> 37:24.786
- even when...
- Todd no.

37:24.788 --> 37:25.853
He was gay okay?

37:25.855 --> 37:27.288
The film was make in the '50s,

37:27.290 --> 37:30.257
so Hollywood censored the
gayness and you would know that

37:30.259 --> 37:33.661
if you had ever read
the fucking play.

37:33.663 --> 37:35.596
I just like the movie.

37:35.598 --> 37:39.769
- Babe!
- Hi!

37:45.308 --> 37:49.978
Oh right
Todd this is Trent.

37:49.980 --> 37:52.112
Trent this is Todd.

37:52.114 --> 37:53.850
Guess which movie
couple we are.

37:54.785 --> 37:55.850
"Brokeback Mountain"?

37:55.852 --> 37:56.817
No.

37:56.819 --> 37:59.088
He's Butch Cassidy and
I'm the Sundance Kid,

37:59.090 --> 38:00.789
because I'm a total
bottom.

38:00.791 --> 38:02.057
Stop making Paul Newman gay.

38:02.059 --> 38:03.726
Okay? There is no evidence.

38:03.728 --> 38:05.026
Oh I heard he slept
with James Dean.

38:05.028 --> 38:06.695
- He did.
- No he was married

38:06.697 --> 38:08.799
to Joanne for 50 years
and they were very happy.

38:10.334 --> 38:11.901
Baby is this your gay
friend that's dating a girl?

38:11.903 --> 38:13.572
That's the one.

38:14.237 --> 38:16.707
Do you guys have sex or?

38:17.976 --> 38:20.610
I don't have to answer that.

38:20.612 --> 38:22.144
- That's a no.
- We're just taking it slow.

38:22.146 --> 38:23.778
And that's denial.

38:23.780 --> 38:25.081
Pussies are gross.

38:25.083 --> 38:26.247
Semen for the win.

38:26.249 --> 38:28.851
Todd doesn't
like bodily fluids.

38:28.853 --> 38:30.785
You know pussies
have juices right?

38:30.787 --> 38:32.724
They spray at you
like Spider-man.

38:34.258 --> 38:35.825
You're making
me uncomfortable.

38:35.827 --> 38:37.793
Oh I'm sorry, I
have a big mouth.

38:37.795 --> 38:39.294
He's not exaggerating.

38:39.296 --> 38:40.296
I just
think it's kind of sad

38:40.298 --> 38:41.796
that you haven't found yourself.

38:41.798 --> 38:43.331
It's a waste.

38:43.333 --> 38:44.702
He's cute though right?

38:45.403 --> 38:46.706
Yeah he's okay.

38:49.207 --> 38:51.140
- I'm gonna go find Rory.
- Okay.

38:53.946 --> 38:56.279
- Baby did you and Todd ever?
- No.

38:56.281 --> 38:58.949
That's what I thought.

38:58.951 --> 38:59.786
Wow.

39:05.723 --> 39:07.857
- Rory?
- Meg.

39:07.859 --> 39:09.861
Come sit with us.

39:13.232 --> 39:16.332
You look so pretty, who are you?

39:16.334 --> 39:18.234
Oh thank you. I'm
Elizabeth Taylor

39:18.236 --> 39:20.404
- from "Cat on...
- "on a Hot Tin Roof".

39:20.406 --> 39:25.044
Oh my God, whoa you and Todd
have a bitchin' sense of humor.

39:26.944 --> 39:28.978
I don't get it.

39:28.980 --> 39:32.049
Okay so Liz is
married to Paul Newman,

39:32.051 --> 39:34.251
and shit hits the fan
because he's secretly gay.

39:34.253 --> 39:36.454
I don't think
that's what happens.

39:36.456 --> 39:37.621
Didn't you read the play?

39:37.623 --> 39:41.425
In the play it's obvi that
he has the hots for Skipper.

39:41.427 --> 39:42.962
Oh I just like the movie.

39:45.731 --> 39:47.865
Oh because you
said Todd is gay.

39:47.867 --> 39:48.932
Oh no it's okay, it's okay.

39:48.934 --> 39:51.304
Todd told me everybody
used to think he was gay.

39:53.806 --> 39:57.374
We didn't just think
he was gay. He was gay.

39:57.376 --> 39:59.077
Like he went to gay bars,

39:59.079 --> 40:01.311
he had a gay eHarmony account,

40:01.313 --> 40:03.447
he sucked Jerry's
gay willy willingly.

40:03.449 --> 40:05.717
- What?
- Oh just the tip,

40:05.719 --> 40:07.050
but that was before you.

40:07.052 --> 40:09.820
Don't worry. He's
totally crazy about you.

40:09.822 --> 40:11.290
Right, right yeah I know.

40:12.492 --> 40:14.128
Can I ask you a
personal question?

40:16.496 --> 40:17.998
How's Todd in bed?

40:19.833 --> 40:20.968
Well you know he,

40:22.269 --> 40:26.504
he is great.

40:26.506 --> 40:28.006
I knew it.

40:28.008 --> 40:29.408
He's just so attentive right?

40:29.410 --> 40:30.808
I bet he's one of those guys

40:30.810 --> 40:32.777
who makes it all
about pleasing you.

40:32.779 --> 40:36.718
Like I literally have to drag
Zane's tongue to my clit.

40:37.818 --> 40:39.183
Well maybe if you shaved.

40:39.185 --> 40:40.319
Shut the fuck up!

40:40.321 --> 40:42.053
I had a skin infection
so I stopped.

40:42.055 --> 40:44.522
You're one to talk,
Bushy McPhearson.

40:44.524 --> 40:48.093
- I love your sass.
- I love your ass.

40:48.095 --> 40:49.430
God I'm so funny!

40:51.265 --> 40:53.902
Todd?

40:56.403 --> 40:58.770
We're doing cake bitches.

40:58.772 --> 41:01.475
Let's go.

41:03.243 --> 41:06.377
Rory meet Marcus.
He's a talent manager.

41:06.379 --> 41:08.946
Rory is a phenomenal actress.

41:08.948 --> 41:10.349
Oh she's never seen me act.

41:10.351 --> 41:11.784
Yeah you got a good look.

41:11.786 --> 41:14.788
You're attractive in an
ordinary sort of way.

41:14.790 --> 41:17.891
The kind of thing you'd find
at a Supercuts in Puerto Rico.

41:17.893 --> 41:19.224
- Thanks.
- You know one of my clients,

41:19.226 --> 41:20.827
she keeps nagging
me and she's like,

41:20.829 --> 41:22.561
"Marcus you never
send me out anymore."

41:22.563 --> 41:23.429
And it's like, "baby I try,

41:23.431 --> 41:25.465
"but there's just
only so many roles

41:25.467 --> 41:27.203
"every year for a female troll."

41:28.570 --> 41:29.936
I'd drop her if she
wasn't my niece.

41:38.079 --> 41:39.945
It is ironic because
rain on your wedding day

41:39.947 --> 41:41.181
is considered good
luck even though

41:41.183 --> 41:42.114
it's a logistical nightmare.

41:42.116 --> 41:43.382
Rain is not good luck.

41:43.384 --> 41:45.485
It's a cultural belief that
a wet knot is harder to untie.

41:45.487 --> 41:47.286
Fine whatever it doesn't
matter, it's not ironic,

41:47.288 --> 41:48.487
it's a logical paradox.

41:48.489 --> 41:50.956
It would be ironic if you
were marrying a meteorologist

41:50.958 --> 41:52.257
named Sonny Weathers
and you planned

41:52.259 --> 41:53.525
an outdoor summer
wedding in Arizona

41:53.527 --> 41:55.228
and then it rained but
only if he set the date.

41:55.230 --> 41:56.829
What if Sonny weathers
wanted it to rain

41:56.831 --> 41:57.832
because it's
considered good luck

41:57.834 --> 41:58.932
and so his forecast was right,

41:58.934 --> 42:00.834
- is it ironic then?
- What?

42:00.836 --> 42:03.236
Yes, no, no Todd it's still not.

42:03.238 --> 42:05.606
Okay fine 10,000 spoons
when all you need is a knife.

42:05.608 --> 42:07.607
- It's not ironic!
- How can you say that?

42:07.609 --> 42:09.243
Like if I work at
a spoon factory

42:09.245 --> 42:10.544
and it's somebody's birthday
and I made them a cake

42:10.546 --> 42:11.879
but I forgot the
knife and I'm like,

42:11.881 --> 42:12.847
"Hey does anybody have a knife?"

42:12.849 --> 42:14.515
Nope but ironically
we have 10,000 spoons!

42:14.517 --> 42:16.850
No because you should
have remembered the knife.

42:16.852 --> 42:19.886
You wouldn't expect
there to be a knife

42:19.888 --> 42:21.087
at a spoon factory.

42:21.089 --> 42:23.189
It's not ironic, it's
just unfortunate.

42:23.191 --> 42:25.626
It would be ironic if
it was a knife factory

42:25.628 --> 42:27.428
but they have a policy
against using company knives

42:27.430 --> 42:28.928
for personal use and then
you had nothing to cut

42:28.930 --> 42:31.332
the fucking cake with
Todd that would be ironic.

42:31.334 --> 42:32.499
Well I think you have
a very narrow definition

42:32.501 --> 42:33.868
of the word ironic.

42:33.870 --> 42:35.002
No you're missing the point.

42:35.004 --> 42:37.403
She's transpired an entire
generation of adolescents

42:37.405 --> 42:38.638
who just causally
toss the word around

42:38.640 --> 42:40.006
to the point where
irony has lost

42:40.008 --> 42:41.441
its whole fucking meaning.

42:41.443 --> 42:42.977
It hasn't lost its
meaning, it's just evolved,

42:42.979 --> 42:44.278
language is fluid.

42:44.280 --> 42:46.380
Yeah well you'd be one
to talk about fluidity.

42:46.382 --> 42:47.882
And how would you like me
to extrapolate that statement?

42:47.884 --> 42:48.784
You know what's really ironic?

42:48.786 --> 42:50.485
Arguing about an
Alanis Morissette song

42:50.487 --> 42:52.587
with your gay boyfriend.

42:52.589 --> 42:54.322
I don't see the irony in that,

42:54.324 --> 42:55.657
and if that's an accusation
then I will have you know

42:55.659 --> 42:57.058
that Ryder is an
unreliable source.

42:57.060 --> 42:58.525
Did you know he cheated
on his eye exam?

42:58.527 --> 43:00.027
You can't cheat
on an eye exam Todd!

43:00.029 --> 43:01.596
He did, he just
memorized the letters.

43:01.598 --> 43:03.534
Okay Meg said and I quote,

43:04.534 --> 43:07.134
you sucked Jerry's
gay willy willingly.

43:07.136 --> 43:09.137
Well that is hearsay, and
as such it's inadmissible.

43:09.139 --> 43:10.371
You're really not
going to admit it?

43:10.373 --> 43:11.605
No I won't admit it
because it was just

43:11.607 --> 43:12.574
a couple of licks and
it didn't mean anything.

43:12.576 --> 43:14.976
Oh my God it means you're gay.

43:14.978 --> 43:17.212
It means that I'm
possibly bisexual

43:17.214 --> 43:18.679
if you feel obliged
to pigeonhole me

43:18.681 --> 43:20.081
into a category
of sexual identity

43:20.083 --> 43:22.116
that you can easily apprehend.

43:22.118 --> 43:23.518
Okay fine I admit
that I've dabbled

43:23.520 --> 43:24.485
in male-on-male
courting in the past,

43:24.487 --> 43:26.520
but I found it repulsive
and I'm with you now,

43:26.522 --> 43:27.621
and I chose and you're a woman,

43:27.623 --> 43:28.690
what else do you need to know?

43:28.692 --> 43:30.190
Why haven't you ever
tried to have sex with me?

43:30.192 --> 43:31.692
I don't like bodily fluids.

43:31.694 --> 43:32.661
You can't use your OCD as
an excuse for everything.

43:32.663 --> 43:34.463
Just because you can
control your brain,

43:34.465 --> 43:36.031
doesn't mean it's a
universal skill-set.

43:36.033 --> 43:38.066
And I don't recall you
attempting to sex me either

43:38.068 --> 43:39.635
and have I accused you
of being a lesbian?

43:39.637 --> 43:40.503
Yeah well it's
different for me.

43:40.505 --> 43:41.637
Why is it
different for you?

43:41.639 --> 43:43.138
- Because
- Because why?

43:43.140 --> 43:46.242
Because you are
supposed to be the man.

43:46.244 --> 43:47.443
Well that's really sexist,

43:47.445 --> 43:48.410
and frankly you
should feel offended.

43:48.412 --> 43:51.013
Todd, we have been
dating for six months

43:51.015 --> 43:52.548
and you haven't even
tried to fondle my boobs.

43:52.550 --> 43:54.050
This is not normal.

43:54.052 --> 43:55.617
Well being normal
is vastly overrated.

43:55.619 --> 43:57.586
Oh my God, you're quoting
"Sabrina the Teenage Witch"!

43:57.588 --> 43:59.354
- You are so gay.
- It's "Halloweentown".

43:59.356 --> 44:00.588
Whatever still gay!

44:00.590 --> 44:01.390
Fine there does
that make you happy?

44:01.392 --> 44:02.325
No, God stop it.

44:02.327 --> 44:04.292
Well what do you want?

44:04.294 --> 44:06.461
I want a real relationship.

44:06.463 --> 44:07.629
This is a real relationship.

44:07.631 --> 44:10.166
No, no this is playing house.

44:10.168 --> 44:11.566
Our names are not on the lease,

44:11.568 --> 44:13.468
and even if we were married
it would be annulled

44:13.470 --> 44:15.137
because there's been no
fucking consummation.

44:15.139 --> 44:16.271
- Well that's redundant.
- What?

44:16.273 --> 44:17.974
Fucking consummation,
it's redundant.

44:17.976 --> 44:19.608
- Focus Todd.
- Sorry fine let's do it.

44:19.610 --> 44:21.343
- What?
- Sex let's do the sex.

44:21.345 --> 44:22.346
- Right now?
- No not now,

44:22.348 --> 44:24.984
I'm hardly in the right
frame of mind right now.

44:25.717 --> 44:27.551
Tonight then I guess?

44:27.553 --> 44:28.621
Yeah okay tonight.

44:30.589 --> 44:31.654
It's tonight.

44:31.656 --> 44:33.190
It came so fast.

44:33.192 --> 44:34.590
It does that.

44:34.592 --> 44:36.629
I'm just gonna
take a shower first.

46:47.695 --> 46:49.431
- There you go.
- Aww.

47:07.715 --> 47:10.617
Okay I think we
need to talk about

47:10.619 --> 47:12.151
the elephant in the room.

47:12.153 --> 47:13.586
The white elephant.

47:13.588 --> 47:15.722
Sure yeah the color
doesn't really matter.

47:15.724 --> 47:17.689
Well the phrase is the
white elephant in the room.

47:17.691 --> 47:18.758
No it's not.

47:18.760 --> 47:19.892
Yes it is, it's derived
from the short story,

47:19.894 --> 47:21.193
"Hills Like White Elephants."

47:21.195 --> 47:22.295
- Wait what?
- By Ernest Hemingway.

47:22.297 --> 47:23.496
Yeah no I know I've read it.

47:23.498 --> 47:24.496
Do you know what
that story's about?

47:24.498 --> 47:26.199
- Abortion.
- Okay yes.

47:26.201 --> 47:27.900
But they never explicitly
say the word abortion,

47:27.902 --> 47:29.302
it's the white
elephant in the room,

47:29.304 --> 47:30.503
the thing nobody
wants to talk about.

47:30.505 --> 47:32.671
No you're mixed up, the white
elephant is the unborn baby.

47:32.673 --> 47:33.473
Well unborn baby, abortion,

47:33.475 --> 47:34.942
I think you're
arguing semantics.

47:34.944 --> 47:36.410
No it's not semantics,
the elephant in the room

47:36.412 --> 47:37.410
is the thing nobody
wants to talk about,

47:37.412 --> 47:39.480
the white elephant is
an unwanted possession

47:39.482 --> 47:40.714
that's a bitch to get rid of,

47:40.716 --> 47:41.748
you're like mixing
two separate idioms.

47:41.750 --> 47:42.750
What? Are you sure?

47:42.752 --> 47:44.285
Yes.

47:44.287 --> 47:45.518
- So then what's the origin...
- Todd forget the

47:45.520 --> 47:46.687
fucking elephants. We
need to talk about sex.

47:46.689 --> 47:47.555
So sex is the white elephant?

47:47.557 --> 47:49.290
No it's the
elephant in the room!

47:49.292 --> 47:50.491
Okay I'm sorry, why
are you getting so angry?

47:50.493 --> 47:51.759
Because you're
not listening to me.

47:51.761 --> 47:52.593
I am listening,
I'm just confused.

47:52.595 --> 47:53.694
You're confused?

47:53.696 --> 47:55.663
I'm confused. Do you want sex?

47:55.665 --> 47:56.564
Only if you do.

47:56.566 --> 47:57.698
Okay well I don't.

47:57.700 --> 47:59.265
Okay good.

47:59.267 --> 48:00.366
Great.

48:00.368 --> 48:01.403
Wonderful.

48:05.540 --> 48:08.642
I realize that I may
have undermined your OCD.

48:08.644 --> 48:10.877
I just have to accept that
you don't like bodily fluids,

48:10.879 --> 48:13.714
so maybe sex isn't
on your agenda.

48:13.716 --> 48:15.815
And for me I mean,

48:15.817 --> 48:17.451
we know that I think intercourse

48:17.453 --> 48:18.618
is a primitive national pastime

48:18.620 --> 48:20.854
that's been overblown by the
media and popular culture.

48:20.856 --> 48:22.958
And copulation is only
intended for reproduction,

48:22.960 --> 48:24.326
and we both hate babies.

48:24.328 --> 48:25.827
So really the
question is why do we

48:25.829 --> 48:27.762
wanna ruin our
relationship with sex?

48:27.764 --> 48:29.364
- We don't.
- I concur.

48:29.366 --> 48:31.766
Also objectively to a random
bystander who didn't know

48:31.768 --> 48:32.599
we were having
intimacy problems,

48:32.601 --> 48:34.235
we look just like
Paul and Joanne.

48:34.237 --> 48:35.737
And who cares what
society thinks anyway?

48:35.739 --> 48:37.239
- Right?
- And it would be ridiculous

48:37.241 --> 48:38.606
to say that we're
just best friends.

48:38.608 --> 48:40.474
I mean we live together,
we sleep together,

48:40.476 --> 48:41.476
we kiss sometimes with tongue,

48:41.478 --> 48:42.744
- your crumbs are falling.
- Sorry.

48:42.746 --> 48:43.878
It's okay I'll vacuum later,

48:43.880 --> 48:46.581
and you give great back
massages which let's be honest,

48:46.583 --> 48:48.550
is basically comparable
to an orgasm anyway.

48:48.552 --> 48:51.385
And you know
maintaining routine,

48:51.387 --> 48:52.920
passionate sex is a
hurdle for any couple.

48:52.922 --> 48:54.322
When you think about it,

48:54.324 --> 48:55.556
we're just throwing
the towel early.

48:55.558 --> 48:56.858
Exactly I mean 65%
of married couples

48:56.860 --> 48:58.425
stop having sex after 10 years.

48:58.427 --> 48:59.360
- Really?
- I don't know,

48:59.362 --> 49:00.561
I just made that number up.

49:00.563 --> 49:01.362
Well it sounds like
a real statistic.

49:01.364 --> 49:02.297
It does doesn't it?

49:02.299 --> 49:03.465
I'm so glad we had this talk.

49:03.467 --> 49:04.101
Me too.

49:06.503 --> 49:08.637
Oh so sex is the white elephant

49:08.639 --> 49:10.272
- because its the thing
- It's the thing

49:10.274 --> 49:11.006
- we wanna get rid of.
- we wanna get rid of okay,

49:11.008 --> 49:12.741
okay that's true you're right.

49:12.743 --> 49:14.442
Are you happy?

49:14.444 --> 49:15.745
Yes.

49:15.747 --> 49:17.779
And why do you think that is?

49:17.781 --> 49:19.714
Because if you
love someone enough,

49:19.716 --> 49:20.883
you can change.

49:20.885 --> 49:22.752
The other day I was re-reading
"The Life-Changing Magic

49:22.754 --> 49:24.687
"of Tidying Up" and
I accidentally ripped

49:24.689 --> 49:27.756
page 138 and it didn't
ever bother me. That much.

49:27.758 --> 49:28.691
Good for you.

49:28.693 --> 49:30.392
I did get rid of the book,

49:30.394 --> 49:31.627
but only because it was
no longer bringing me joy.

49:31.629 --> 49:33.763
Anyway Rory makes
me a better person,

49:33.765 --> 49:35.865
I'm not crying, my
hand eczema is gone,

49:35.867 --> 49:37.866
I'm watching more documentaries.

49:37.868 --> 49:39.635
It's so funny to think I was
in here just six months ago

49:39.637 --> 49:41.870
complaining about how I
was gonna be alone forever.

49:48.646 --> 49:50.412
What a hoot.

49:50.414 --> 49:51.814
You know Todd,

49:51.816 --> 49:54.950
I have to admit when I
told you to experiment

49:54.952 --> 49:56.551
with your heterosexual inklings,

49:56.553 --> 49:58.621
I wasn't sure it
was the best idea,

49:58.623 --> 50:02.694
but you actually may
be somewhat straight.

50:03.661 --> 50:04.730
Like a Kinsey 3.

50:05.732 --> 50:08.364
Thank you, that means
so much coming from you.

50:08.366 --> 50:10.701
You're welcome.
Will you be spending

50:10.703 --> 50:11.835
Thanksgiving with your parents?

50:11.837 --> 50:13.869
I will yes and
I'm bringing Rory.

50:13.871 --> 50:16.605
How exciting.
Please remind them

50:16.607 --> 50:18.608
that they still owe
me for September.

50:18.610 --> 50:19.812
I sent them an invoice.

50:23.415 --> 50:24.780
Pleased to meet
you, I'm Topanga.

50:24.782 --> 50:25.748
- Nice to meet you.
- We're so happy to have you.

50:25.750 --> 50:28.287
- This is my husband.
- Come on in, come on.

50:30.054 --> 50:31.420
Oh take off your shoes.

50:31.422 --> 50:32.389
- Oh yeah okay.
- She doesn't have to

50:32.391 --> 50:33.023
do that right away.

50:36.994 --> 50:38.895
Okay so when can
we expect grandkids?

50:38.897 --> 50:40.529
- Mother.
- What?

50:40.531 --> 50:42.398
Rory is the first girl
that you've brought home.

50:42.400 --> 50:44.601
It's my cultural duty to
torment you in front of her.

50:44.603 --> 50:45.870
Oh but we don't want children.

50:45.872 --> 50:47.037
They bring you unhappiness.

50:47.039 --> 50:48.638
Oh don't be so
self-deprecating Todd,

50:48.640 --> 50:49.807
we forgive you.

50:49.809 --> 50:51.376
It's true, they've
done studies.

50:51.378 --> 50:52.642
Parents report
statistically lower levels

50:52.644 --> 50:54.077
of happiness and
marital satisfaction

50:54.079 --> 50:55.713
compared to non-parents.

50:55.715 --> 50:58.015
That's funny I don't
recall filing out a survey.

50:58.017 --> 51:00.484
Oh not all parent I'm sure.

51:00.486 --> 51:01.785
I'm sure you guys are outliers.

51:01.787 --> 51:03.588
But I can't handle
irrational behavior,

51:03.590 --> 51:04.856
or crying or poop.

51:04.858 --> 51:08.126
Well having kids fills
your life with purpose.

51:08.128 --> 51:09.760
But does that intangible
sense of purpose

51:09.762 --> 51:11.729
outweigh the burden of lost
sleep, time and income?

51:11.731 --> 51:13.464
Or are you justifying
your actions?

51:13.466 --> 51:14.698
I have no buyers remorse.

51:14.700 --> 51:16.934
You were the second best
decision I ever made.

51:16.936 --> 51:17.769
What was the first?

51:17.771 --> 51:18.970
Investing in Google.

51:18.972 --> 51:19.970
What am I?

51:19.972 --> 51:21.104
You're the fourth.

51:21.106 --> 51:22.640
Well we have
everything we need.

51:22.642 --> 51:23.575
Why would we purposefully
follow a path

51:23.577 --> 51:25.642
that could obstruct
our personal happiness?

51:25.644 --> 51:27.577
Because there are
some things in life

51:27.579 --> 51:30.013
that are more important
than personal happiness.

51:30.015 --> 51:31.481
Like what?

51:31.483 --> 51:32.716
I don't know honey,
why don't we just ask

51:32.718 --> 51:33.552
our friend Socrates?

51:33.554 --> 51:35.420
- Or Gandhi.
- Maybe Harriet Tubman

51:35.422 --> 51:36.621
- would know.
- That little blond kind

51:36.623 --> 51:38.757
- in "Pay it Forward".
- Oh I love him,

51:38.759 --> 51:39.958
what ever happened to that kid?

51:39.960 --> 51:41.659
Okay point made.

51:41.661 --> 51:42.560
All right
here's why you have kids.

51:42.562 --> 51:44.163
Now you're both
healthy, intelligent,

51:44.165 --> 51:46.197
valuable contributors
to society.

51:46.199 --> 51:47.900
So you have a
biological imperative

51:47.902 --> 51:49.201
to pass on those genes

51:49.203 --> 51:51.737
because you know who's
ruining this country?

51:51.739 --> 51:52.807
The Mexicans.

51:53.908 --> 51:54.873
- Wally.
- Okay dad can we save

51:54.875 --> 51:56.775
the racism until after dessert?

51:56.777 --> 51:58.677
What I'm not saying that
all Mexicans are stupid,

51:58.679 --> 52:00.645
I'm just saying and there's
plenty of literature

52:00.647 --> 52:01.547
to back me up on this.

52:01.549 --> 52:03.681
There's an inverse
correlation between

52:03.683 --> 52:05.016
intelligence and fertility

52:05.018 --> 52:07.485
and guess who's popping
out the most babies?

52:07.487 --> 52:09.621
- Mexicans.
- Bingo, and you all know

52:09.623 --> 52:11.723
- who's the smartest race.
- Asians.

52:11.725 --> 52:13.458
God damn right.

52:13.460 --> 52:17.128
What he means is you would
both make excellent parents.

52:17.130 --> 52:19.931
- No.
- No, no what I mean is

52:19.933 --> 52:22.235
everything that is ultimately
wrong with the world

52:22.237 --> 52:24.470
is caused by stupidity
so smart people

52:24.472 --> 52:27.774
have an obligation to
combat reverse Darwinism.

52:27.776 --> 52:29.508
Then why am I an only child?

52:29.510 --> 52:30.977
- You were enough.
- Rory name a social issue.

52:30.979 --> 52:32.745
- Don't encourage him.
- AIDS.

52:32.747 --> 52:35.548
AIDS wouldn't even exist
if some fucking idiot

52:35.550 --> 52:36.816
didn't have sex with a monkey.

52:36.818 --> 52:37.783
That is, what?

52:37.785 --> 52:39.718
You know how I would
eradicate stupid people?

52:39.720 --> 52:41.220
- Sarin gas.
- No how?

52:41.222 --> 52:42.655
Here's what I would do.

52:42.657 --> 52:44.823
Every male should have
a vasectomy at birth,

52:44.825 --> 52:46.225
just a little snip, snip.

52:46.227 --> 52:48.628
In order to qualify for
a reverse vasectomy,

52:48.630 --> 52:50.696
the couple in
question has to pass

52:50.698 --> 52:52.097
a series of aptitude tests.

52:52.099 --> 52:53.633
Okay now that's
actually genius.

52:53.635 --> 52:55.200
No that is
completely unethical.

52:55.202 --> 52:57.903
You cannot advance society by
debasing natural human rights.

52:57.905 --> 52:59.771
And what I'm saying
is that having children

52:59.773 --> 53:02.108
shouldn't be a right, it
should be a privilege.

53:02.110 --> 53:03.142
Amen.

53:03.144 --> 53:04.510
Okay ethics aside,

53:04.512 --> 53:05.678
implementation
would be impossible.

53:05.680 --> 53:07.780
- No government could ever...
- Oh God Todd, stop being so

53:07.782 --> 53:09.683
pragmatic he's obviously
being hypothetical.

53:09.685 --> 53:10.551
Listen to your girlfriend son.

53:10.553 --> 53:11.951
Okay hypothetically
this would be

53:11.953 --> 53:13.219
a repressive caste system.

53:13.221 --> 53:14.687
There would be a
proletarian revolution.

53:14.689 --> 53:16.556
You're right, instead
of abortion clinics,

53:16.558 --> 53:17.790
we would have pregnancy clinics.

53:17.792 --> 53:19.627
Would that change the
meaning of pro-choice?

53:19.629 --> 53:21.895
Oh and you just know that
there'd be some sleezeball

53:21.897 --> 53:23.931
on Skid Row with a
trench coat who is like,

53:23.933 --> 53:25.900
"Hey you wanna buy some sperm?"

53:28.103 --> 53:30.638
and it's probably
not even human sperm.

53:30.640 --> 53:32.806
That's disgusting.

53:32.808 --> 53:35.808
Okay I have a hypothetical.

53:35.810 --> 53:40.816
What if a very smart, beautiful
woman married a stupid man?

53:42.919 --> 53:44.884
Are you trying
to say something?

53:44.886 --> 53:47.020
No it is true, she's
just with me for the sex.

53:47.022 --> 53:48.989
Oh honey come on. Not
in front of the kids.

53:48.991 --> 53:51.158
Oh come on, Todd
is a big boy now.

53:51.160 --> 53:52.659
He should know that his old man

53:52.661 --> 53:54.094
still pitches like
Roger Clemens.

53:54.096 --> 53:55.699
Yes he does.

53:56.934 --> 53:58.767
Is that a basketball person?

54:10.681 --> 54:12.146
Oh God look at that.

54:12.148 --> 54:15.816
Oh tiny boy. Todd
you used to be so cheerful.

54:15.818 --> 54:18.320
What happened?

54:18.322 --> 54:21.722
The sweetest little baby.
Oh my God this reminds me,

54:21.724 --> 54:23.291
I think it's in
the garage honey,

54:23.293 --> 54:28.162
we have a video of
Todd doing the Macarena

54:28.164 --> 54:30.064
to "Building a Mystery"
and he called it,

54:30.066 --> 54:31.800
no, this is the best,

54:31.802 --> 54:34.135
he called it the
Sarah MacLacharena.

54:34.137 --> 54:35.403
Can we find that?

54:35.405 --> 54:37.271
Oh gosh I'm gonna
send Wally out to look for it.

54:37.273 --> 54:40.108
- Okay.
- Oh wait, look at this one,

54:40.110 --> 54:42.242
that's in Venice. Where
are you going sweetie?

54:42.244 --> 54:43.345
I have more.

54:57.794 --> 55:00.131
You seem well, you
taking your meds?

55:01.165 --> 55:04.236
Yes.

55:06.803 --> 55:08.069
That girl is something else,

55:08.071 --> 55:10.741
- you really hit the jackpot.
- Thank you.

55:17.080 --> 55:17.982
Todd I...

55:20.984 --> 55:21.787
Dad?

55:32.831 --> 55:35.934
I'm proud of you, I just
want you to know that.

55:59.058 --> 56:00.923
Are your hands getting tired?

56:00.925 --> 56:02.362
No I can keep going.

56:07.800 --> 56:10.833
Did my dad seem
unusually nice to you?

56:10.835 --> 56:12.004
Yeah he's awesome.

56:13.206 --> 56:17.010
Your mom is doubly awesome
because she's 50% less racist.

56:18.911 --> 56:19.746
Yeah.

56:23.482 --> 56:25.919
I know this is my
anxiety talking. I just,

56:27.352 --> 56:29.821
I always thought my parents
loved me unconditionally,

56:29.823 --> 56:32.292
and tonight it felt
like they loved me more.

56:33.392 --> 56:35.959
Like they were relieved
that you were a girl

56:35.961 --> 56:37.761
and I kept thinking that
if I brought a boy home

56:37.763 --> 56:39.730
it wouldn't have been like that.

56:39.732 --> 56:40.732
They wouldn't have
used the good chard,

56:40.734 --> 56:42.232
the turkey would have been dry,

56:42.234 --> 56:44.771
my dad wouldn't hug me,
he'd just shake my hand.

56:47.740 --> 56:50.006
I know. Why am I
thinking that right?

56:50.008 --> 56:50.843
Stupid brain.

56:56.749 --> 56:58.182
Okay my turn.

57:08.127 --> 57:12.463
I think they're just
happy that you're happy.

57:12.465 --> 57:14.101
Yeah you're probably right.

57:28.815 --> 57:29.717
- Todd.
- Meg.

57:30.518 --> 57:34.786
Rory, merry holidays.

57:34.788 --> 57:36.387
We brought fluffernutters.

57:36.389 --> 57:39.060
Bitchin'. You can put them
next to the jello shots.

57:40.161 --> 57:42.126
Don't spaz but
Ryder brought Jerry.

57:42.128 --> 57:43.929
- Jerry who?
- Blow job Jerry,

57:43.931 --> 57:45.264
but don't spaz I'm sure
he won't say anything

57:45.266 --> 57:46.798
you don't want him to say.

57:46.800 --> 57:48.467
God, this is so awkward right?

57:48.469 --> 57:50.235
- Is it?
- You know Todd

57:50.237 --> 57:51.170
is such a sweet guy,

57:51.172 --> 57:52.503
I'm so happy for you guys.

57:52.505 --> 57:53.938
I guess he didn't like me,

57:53.940 --> 57:56.574
but whatever, what are
you gonna do right?

57:56.576 --> 57:58.812
And you are here with...

57:58.814 --> 58:03.249
Ryder. Yeah, he
invited me last minute.

58:03.251 --> 58:05.385
You know I didn't think
he liked me either.

58:05.387 --> 58:07.921
He usually doesn't even
respond to my texts.

58:07.923 --> 58:10.923
But you know what, I bet
somebody else bailed and

58:10.925 --> 58:13.392
he just invited me because
he knew I'd be available.

58:19.867 --> 58:21.269
Tonight should be fun though.

58:22.604 --> 58:23.906
- Cybill Shepherd.
- Ellen Degeneres.

58:25.974 --> 58:28.040
- Novak Djokovic.
- Ellen Degeneres.

58:28.042 --> 58:29.144
Heath Ledger.

58:30.477 --> 58:32.046
- Judy Garland.
- Ellen Degeneres.

58:33.548 --> 58:34.981
- Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
- Ellen Degeneres.

58:34.983 --> 58:36.015
None of them are
Ellen Degeneres!

58:36.017 --> 58:37.383
Could be.

58:37.385 --> 58:38.551
- Ellen Degeneres.
- Tracy Chapman.

58:38.553 --> 58:41.086
- Yes, yes, yes we win!
- Yes!

58:44.459 --> 58:47.161
28, 62. We beat you so bad.

58:47.163 --> 58:48.362
You didn't do anything.

58:48.364 --> 58:49.563
Yeah I'm sorry, whose
idea was it to have

58:49.565 --> 58:51.331
fucking Will and Grace
on the same team?

58:51.333 --> 58:52.532
You know I've
actually never seen

58:52.534 --> 58:54.335
- I don't watch
- "Will and Grace".

58:55.170 --> 58:56.436
They are so cute.

58:56.438 --> 58:58.873
- I want that.
- Yeah keep dreaming, Jerry.

58:58.875 --> 59:00.107
Well we can play
a different game.

59:00.109 --> 59:01.641
I brought Bananagrams
and Exploding Kittens,

59:01.643 --> 59:03.643
and I tried to bring Scene
It: Turner Classics edition

59:03.645 --> 59:05.212
but this one confiscated it.

59:05.214 --> 59:06.579
It's not fun when you
know all the answers.

59:06.581 --> 59:07.514
It's fun for me.

59:07.516 --> 59:09.983
Okay fuck all those options.

59:09.985 --> 59:11.652
I'm the hostess and I've decided

59:11.654 --> 59:13.556
that we're gonna
play a grown-up game.

59:14.389 --> 59:15.491
Truth or dare.

59:17.292 --> 59:18.125
Oh dare baby, pick me,

59:18.127 --> 59:19.560
pick me, I pick dare.

59:19.562 --> 59:23.529
Zane. I dare you to

59:23.531 --> 59:28.435
strip naked and let me draw
flowers all over your body.

59:28.437 --> 59:29.272
Fine.

59:33.110 --> 59:33.945
Oh wow.

59:36.646 --> 59:37.881
Go on then.

59:40.082 --> 59:42.350
Ryder, truth or dare?

59:42.352 --> 59:44.586
Dare obviously.

59:44.588 --> 59:49.157
I dare you to
spank Jimmy's ass.

59:49.159 --> 59:50.658
It's Jerry.

59:50.660 --> 59:51.660
You heard the man Jimmy,

59:51.662 --> 59:52.494
get your sweet tush over here.

59:52.496 --> 59:55.562
Okay. Like that? Oh!

59:55.564 --> 59:57.499
You've been a
bad, bad boy Jerry.

59:57.501 --> 59:59.033
- I have.
- All those nights alone.

59:59.035 --> 01:00:01.236
Yeah I live alone.

01:00:01.238 --> 01:00:02.637
Yeah this is what
you like, isn't it?

01:00:02.639 --> 01:00:04.071
Ow okay, that
one was too hard.

01:00:04.073 --> 01:00:05.976
- AHH.
- There we go.

01:00:08.244 --> 01:00:09.544
So fun.

01:00:09.546 --> 01:00:13.213
- Meg. Truth or dare?
- Please.

01:00:13.215 --> 01:00:18.221
I dare you to give everyone
at this party a lap dance.

01:00:19.055 --> 01:00:20.690
Oh my God yes.

01:00:20.692 --> 01:00:23.426
Alexa, play slut playlist.

01:00:28.632 --> 01:00:31.602
Yes. Oh my God.

01:00:32.437 --> 01:00:35.140
Okay. Oh. Yeah.

01:00:38.509 --> 01:00:40.012
- You like this, baby?
- Yeah.

01:00:41.279 --> 01:00:43.545
- Todd, Todd is he gonna?
- Oh God okay.

01:00:43.547 --> 01:00:45.681
Yup, yup, yup that's happening.

01:00:47.518 --> 01:00:49.420
Oh my God, oh my God!

01:00:50.687 --> 01:00:51.522
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:00:55.526 --> 01:00:57.663
Oh, sorry I just have,

01:00:59.129 --> 01:01:00.529
an eyelash in my eye.

01:01:00.531 --> 01:01:02.000
I'm just gonna.

01:01:04.469 --> 01:01:05.404
Bye Rory.

01:01:06.337 --> 01:01:08.073
Fuck I'm horny.

01:01:09.273 --> 01:01:10.606
I think we all are.

01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:17.282
You wanna do the thing?

01:01:19.650 --> 01:01:21.219
Not that horny, Jerry.

01:01:34.666 --> 01:01:37.034
My sweater is green.

01:01:37.036 --> 01:01:38.671
My sweater is green.

01:01:39.570 --> 01:01:40.572
My skirt is beige.

01:01:41.807 --> 01:01:44.644
The walls are gray,
the door is...

01:01:46.077 --> 01:01:46.646
Truth.

01:01:48.579 --> 01:01:50.650
- Have you and Rory...
- I mean dare.

01:01:52.284 --> 01:01:53.586
Afraid of the truth Todd?

01:01:55.086 --> 01:01:55.688
Stand up.

01:01:59.392 --> 01:02:00.227
Just do it.

01:02:02.729 --> 01:02:04.564
I dare you to switch
clothes with me.

01:02:12.504 --> 01:02:14.340
You have to play Todd.

01:02:16.776 --> 01:02:17.611
Let me.

01:02:21.714 --> 01:02:22.549
Todd?

01:02:25.350 --> 01:02:29.655
I have a headache, I think it's
all that snollygoster I ate.

01:02:36.395 --> 01:02:37.631
I'm in the shower.

01:02:50.577 --> 01:02:53.547
- Can I come in?
- What?

01:02:55.349 --> 01:02:57.152
In the shower can I come in?

01:02:58.219 --> 01:02:59.351
Well I have a bristle
body back brush,

01:02:59.353 --> 01:03:00.751
so I can reach everywhere,

01:03:00.753 --> 01:03:02.554
It might be counterproductive.

01:03:02.556 --> 01:03:05.456
Please?

01:03:05.458 --> 01:03:07.461
I won't look I promise.

01:03:10.463 --> 01:03:11.298
Okay.

01:03:33.455 --> 01:03:37.226
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:03:38.260 --> 01:03:39.361
I love you.

01:03:42.863 --> 01:03:44.466
I love you too.

01:04:32.815 --> 01:04:34.949
What are you doing?

01:04:34.951 --> 01:04:35.819
Can't you tell?

01:04:36.752 --> 01:04:38.621
Well I think so but.

01:04:39.454 --> 01:04:41.789
It should be obvious.

01:04:41.791 --> 01:04:45.695
- You shouldn't.
- I know.

01:04:46.962 --> 01:04:49.465
Okay stop, stop acting.

01:04:51.866 --> 01:04:53.567
Like now or in general?

01:04:53.569 --> 01:04:54.670
You tell me.

01:04:55.704 --> 01:04:57.503
Are you getting cast?

01:04:57.505 --> 01:04:59.542
Is this routine working for you?

01:05:07.717 --> 01:05:08.649
I think you have a Trojan.

01:05:08.651 --> 01:05:10.484
Impossible I only bareback.

01:05:10.486 --> 01:05:11.519
- Trojan horse.
- My nickname in college

01:05:11.521 --> 01:05:13.254
was literally Bareback Ryder.

01:05:13.256 --> 01:05:14.723
That's really unsafe.

01:05:14.725 --> 01:05:16.624
Yeah it's also a joke
Todd, I read the "Iliad".

01:05:16.626 --> 01:05:17.725
The Trojan horse
wasn't in the "Iliad".

01:05:17.727 --> 01:05:19.827
Okay I skimmed the "Iliad".

01:05:19.829 --> 01:05:21.328
It keeps shutting me down.

01:05:21.330 --> 01:05:22.497
What do you do on the internet?

01:05:22.499 --> 01:05:23.832
Do you really wanna know?

01:05:23.834 --> 01:05:24.832
- No.
- Are you sure?

01:05:24.834 --> 01:05:26.267
You might like it.

01:05:26.269 --> 01:05:27.535
I'm sure we don't
like the same things.

01:05:27.537 --> 01:05:29.437
Okay keep telling
yourself that Todd.

01:05:29.439 --> 01:05:30.705
Okay you know what,
you can fix this.

01:05:30.707 --> 01:05:32.877
I would if I could but.

01:05:34.278 --> 01:05:35.510
I don't know what
your problem is.

01:05:35.512 --> 01:05:37.412
I thought that you
said it was a Trojan.

01:05:37.414 --> 01:05:38.613
No I yes, it's a Trojan.

01:05:38.615 --> 01:05:41.048
I don't know what your
problem is with me.

01:05:41.050 --> 01:05:42.783
Do you really wanna know?

01:05:42.785 --> 01:05:45.687
Yes.

01:05:45.689 --> 01:05:47.321
My problem with you Todd,

01:05:47.323 --> 01:05:48.823
is that you are trying so hard

01:05:48.825 --> 01:05:51.593
to be something that you're
not and it's offensive.

01:05:51.595 --> 01:05:53.761
- Oh I offend you?
- Yes you offend me.

01:05:53.763 --> 01:05:55.897
You are not bisexual Todd,

01:05:55.899 --> 01:05:57.666
and it's gays like
you who can't get over

01:05:57.668 --> 01:05:59.802
their internalized
homophobic shame

01:05:59.804 --> 01:06:01.737
that reinforces society's idea

01:06:01.739 --> 01:06:03.938
that actual
bisexuality is a myth.

01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:04.773
Why do you even care?

01:06:04.775 --> 01:06:05.708
You're not bisexual.

01:06:05.710 --> 01:06:07.043
I've slept with bisexuals.

01:06:07.045 --> 01:06:08.643
- So?
- Rory is not

01:06:08.645 --> 01:06:10.078
your girlfriend Todd.

01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:11.713
She's your fucking Katie Holmes.

01:06:11.715 --> 01:06:14.549
- Well I love her.
- No you think you love her,

01:06:14.551 --> 01:06:16.585
but you are gonna break
that poor girl's heart.

01:06:16.587 --> 01:06:18.087
Yeah you'd like
that wouldn't you?

01:06:18.089 --> 01:06:20.690
Right because I'm the
asshole in this situation.

01:06:20.692 --> 01:06:22.293
Well you are what you eat.

01:06:23.627 --> 01:06:26.429
And when you'd get
to be so cleaver Todd?

01:06:26.431 --> 01:06:27.799
I've always been clever.

01:06:32.837 --> 01:06:34.770
What are you doing?

01:06:34.772 --> 01:06:36.706
Can't you tell?

01:06:36.708 --> 01:06:38.777
Well I think so but.

01:06:40.043 --> 01:06:41.110
It should be obvious.

01:06:41.112 --> 01:06:42.681
- You shouldn't.
- I know.

01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:46.716
I mean I really
wish you wouldn't.

01:06:46.718 --> 01:06:49.653
You should
have thought of that.

01:06:49.655 --> 01:06:50.957
Is it because of what I did?

01:06:51.789 --> 01:06:55.327
Partly yes, mostly no.

01:06:56.494 --> 01:06:57.727
Stop doing that and
really listen to me.

01:06:57.729 --> 01:06:59.965
You don't recognize no do you?

01:07:00.965 --> 01:07:01.897
I'm just asking you to listen.

01:07:01.899 --> 01:07:03.035
I said no.

01:07:29.128 --> 01:07:29.961
Better.

01:07:47.746 --> 01:07:48.746
That would never
fucking happen!

01:07:48.748 --> 01:07:50.014
I know it's irrational,

01:07:50.016 --> 01:07:51.581
but that doesn't mean
it would never happen.

01:07:51.583 --> 01:07:53.451
No it's more than irrational
Todd, it's paranoia.

01:07:53.453 --> 01:07:54.719
Nobody has ever been murdered

01:07:54.721 --> 01:07:55.819
because they registered
as an organ donor!

01:07:55.821 --> 01:07:57.654
I didn't say that I think
I'm gonna be murdered,

01:07:57.656 --> 01:07:58.989
I said as soon as I
register as an organ donor,

01:07:58.991 --> 01:08:00.123
I think I'm going to die.

01:08:00.125 --> 01:08:01.525
- Why?
- Because it would be ironic.

01:08:01.527 --> 01:08:02.759
- Sure you can appreciate that.
- Oh my God.

01:08:02.761 --> 01:08:04.027
Also I don't like
the idea of my organs

01:08:04.029 --> 01:08:05.163
in somebody else's body,

01:08:05.165 --> 01:08:06.596
it's like when
different foods touch.

01:08:06.598 --> 01:08:08.632
I need a kidney,
I need a kidney

01:08:08.634 --> 01:08:09.534
and you're a perfect match.

01:08:09.536 --> 01:08:11.636
You're type O, I
can't give you a kidney.

01:08:11.638 --> 01:08:13.004
You can give me a kidney.

01:08:13.006 --> 01:08:14.705
Hypothetically if
you could save my life

01:08:14.707 --> 01:08:15.806
with one of your
organs, would you?

01:08:15.808 --> 01:08:17.975
Hypothetically yes.

01:08:17.977 --> 01:08:19.145
Realistically?

01:08:24.716 --> 01:08:27.618
Todd just leave it.

01:08:27.621 --> 01:08:28.456
Todd.

01:08:30.724 --> 01:08:31.559
Todd.

01:08:33.761 --> 01:08:34.792
Todd!

01:08:37.729 --> 01:08:38.932
Nothing?

01:08:44.104 --> 01:08:46.938
How about now?

01:08:46.939 --> 01:08:47.975
No sorry.

01:08:53.046 --> 01:08:54.679
We could try an
open relationship,

01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:56.550
if you think that would help.

01:09:11.499 --> 01:09:13.933
What if I have
homosexual anxiety OCD?

01:09:13.935 --> 01:09:15.768
So I have an obsessive
irrational fear of being gay

01:09:15.770 --> 01:09:17.237
but I'm actually straight.

01:09:17.238 --> 01:09:18.938
Or what if my fear of being gay

01:09:18.939 --> 01:09:20.540
has nothing to do with my OCD

01:09:20.542 --> 01:09:21.974
but I have an egodystonic
sexual orientation

01:09:21.975 --> 01:09:23.675
meaning I just
don't want to be gay

01:09:23.676 --> 01:09:25.577
because it conflicts with
my idealized self-image,

01:09:25.578 --> 01:09:26.912
perpetuated by popular culture?

01:09:26.913 --> 01:09:30.617
Or what if I'm a
heteromantic asexual?

01:09:30.618 --> 01:09:32.085
So I'm romantically
attracted to women,

01:09:32.087 --> 01:09:33.653
but sexually
attracted to nobody.

01:09:33.654 --> 01:09:34.953
And the thing is when
I say them out loud,

01:09:34.955 --> 01:09:36.089
they all sound right but

01:09:36.091 --> 01:09:38.625
what if I'm none of the above?

01:09:38.627 --> 01:09:39.559
Do you remember what happened

01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:41.260
when your father took
you to Disneyland

01:09:41.261 --> 01:09:43.729
and tried to force you
onto a roller coaster?

01:09:43.731 --> 01:09:45.834
- Yes of course I was there.
- What happened?

01:09:47.234 --> 01:09:48.966
I started screaming
that he was kidnapping me

01:09:48.969 --> 01:09:51.136
and he almost got arrested
and we never went back.

01:09:51.138 --> 01:09:52.671
You can lead a horse to water.

01:09:52.673 --> 01:09:54.607
But you can't make it
get on a roller coaster

01:09:54.609 --> 01:09:55.742
or try anal sex. I get it.

01:09:55.744 --> 01:09:57.578
I'm the horse but
am I a gay horse,

01:09:57.580 --> 01:09:59.747
a straight horse,
or a Shetland pony?

01:09:59.749 --> 01:10:00.681
Which is basically a gay horse.

01:10:00.683 --> 01:10:02.181
That's what Ryder would
say if he was here.

01:10:02.183 --> 01:10:03.419
See he's in my head!

01:10:07.290 --> 01:10:09.693
Will you please just
like tell me what I am?

01:10:11.294 --> 01:10:15.095
Well why don't we just
start with the basics?

01:10:15.097 --> 01:10:16.633
Are you sure you're a boy?

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:20.570
Well I was until now.

01:10:24.139 --> 01:10:24.974
Interesting.

01:10:33.115 --> 01:10:34.681
Rory?

01:10:34.683 --> 01:10:36.585
Oh my God it is you hi!

01:10:37.253 --> 01:10:38.985
Wow this is crazy flakes.

01:10:38.987 --> 01:10:40.753
- Hi.
- Nicole Shaw

01:10:40.755 --> 01:10:42.756
from Belmont High?

01:10:42.758 --> 01:10:44.962
I know, I know, I know I
look totally different.

01:10:45.795 --> 01:10:46.830
Yeah.

01:10:49.733 --> 01:10:51.665
- Nose job. I got a nose job.
- Oh.

01:10:51.667 --> 01:10:53.601
So wow here you
are auditioning.

01:10:53.603 --> 01:10:55.936
I didn't even know you
were an actress.

01:10:55.938 --> 01:10:57.806
Did you do plays in high school?

01:10:57.808 --> 01:10:58.776
No not really.

01:11:00.643 --> 01:11:03.677
- Did you?
- Yeah I was in every play.

01:11:03.679 --> 01:11:05.180
Right you were yeah.

01:11:05.182 --> 01:11:06.748
So how long have
you been in L.A.?

01:11:06.750 --> 01:11:08.749
Are you booking a lot?

01:11:08.751 --> 01:11:11.151
Oh well I'm actually not
supposed to say anything,

01:11:11.153 --> 01:11:13.622
but I'm the new face
of the Squatty Potty.

01:11:13.624 --> 01:11:17.859
Nice wow yeah, I booked
two nationals this year.

01:11:17.861 --> 01:11:20.865
So it's like hell
yeah no more day job!

01:11:21.764 --> 01:11:23.030
What was your day job?

01:11:23.032 --> 01:11:24.966
Oh no, I'm just
being facetious.

01:11:24.968 --> 01:11:27.067
I never had one.
Thank God you know?

01:11:27.069 --> 01:11:28.969
That's not really facetious.

01:11:28.971 --> 01:11:30.171
Awe you're so sweet.

01:11:30.173 --> 01:11:33.342
No I mean,

01:11:33.344 --> 01:11:34.677
how'd you pay rent?

01:11:34.679 --> 01:11:36.111
I live with my boo,

01:11:36.113 --> 01:11:38.781
and he's in banks or something

01:11:38.783 --> 01:11:40.316
so that's super convenient.

01:11:40.318 --> 01:11:42.384
And you know my
parents will help me

01:11:42.386 --> 01:11:43.553
if I max out my card.

01:11:43.555 --> 01:11:47.059
They just like, they love me
too much to see me suffer.

01:11:48.792 --> 01:11:51.227
People think that all
we do is memorize lines,

01:11:51.229 --> 01:11:54.897
but acting is really the
hardest job there is.

01:11:54.899 --> 01:11:57.366
I don't know about that.

01:11:57.368 --> 01:12:00.669
- No it is.
- It's emotionally exhausting

01:12:00.671 --> 01:12:02.972
sure, but it's not like
a heart transplant.

01:12:02.974 --> 01:12:06.741
If you're doing
it right, it is.

01:12:06.743 --> 01:12:09.144
Hey Janice. Here's
those files you wanted.

01:12:18.722 --> 01:12:19.722
Is my breath...

01:12:20.793 --> 01:12:21.828
Sorry.

01:12:25.364 --> 01:12:27.464
Is my breath that bad?

01:12:33.971 --> 01:12:35.237
How 'bout now?

01:12:35.239 --> 01:12:36.309
Better.

01:12:39.177 --> 01:12:40.310
Yeah that was great.

01:12:40.312 --> 01:12:43.179
Nicole, will you just stick
around for a little bit?

01:12:43.181 --> 01:12:44.880
- Oh of course yeah.
- Thank you so much.

01:12:44.882 --> 01:12:46.215
- Um...
- Rory.

01:12:46.217 --> 01:12:47.753
- Rory.
- Rory, Rory.

01:12:48.988 --> 01:12:50.821
That's all we need. Thank you
so much for coming in today.

01:12:50.823 --> 01:12:52.723
- Okay thanks.
- Yeah bye-bye.

01:12:52.725 --> 01:12:54.457
- Great job.
- You're really loud.

01:12:54.459 --> 01:12:56.960
Thank you so much. Bye.

01:13:12.378 --> 01:13:13.781
I'm moving to Seattle.

01:13:14.748 --> 01:13:16.180
Well you can't be
an actress in Seattle.

01:13:16.182 --> 01:13:17.782
Well apparently I
can't be one here either.

01:13:17.784 --> 01:13:20.118
- Not with that attitude.
- Todd, I am too smart

01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:23.019
to keep investing my life in
a career and a relationship

01:13:23.021 --> 01:13:24.387
that is going nowhere.

01:13:24.389 --> 01:13:26.390
- Lucille Ball.
- What about Lucille Ball?

01:13:26.392 --> 01:13:28.259
Lucille Ball didn't make
it big until she was 40!

01:13:28.261 --> 01:13:29.827
- Oh my God.
- I mean what if she

01:13:29.829 --> 01:13:30.461
had given up?

01:13:30.463 --> 01:13:31.496
Can you imagine that?

01:13:31.498 --> 01:13:32.796
Why are you packing?

01:13:32.798 --> 01:13:34.431
You could have your own show,

01:13:34.433 --> 01:13:36.466
- I Rove Rory.
- Yeah and then you can be

01:13:36.468 --> 01:13:38.135
my heavily accented
straight man.

01:13:38.137 --> 01:13:40.371
- Yeah.
- No Todd. Come on.

01:13:40.373 --> 01:13:42.105
Todd, Todd if you
don't want me to go,

01:13:42.107 --> 01:13:43.474
why are you packing?

01:13:43.476 --> 01:13:45.076
- I don't know!
- Those aren't my clothes.

01:13:45.078 --> 01:13:45.913
I know.

01:13:47.112 --> 01:13:48.347
Todd we can do better.

01:13:49.414 --> 01:13:50.814
We both deserve more.

01:13:50.816 --> 01:13:52.315
I don't want more, I'm happy.

01:13:52.317 --> 01:13:53.484
- I'm not.
- Well that's your

01:13:53.486 --> 01:13:55.153
fault not mine.

01:13:55.155 --> 01:13:57.288
Todd next week or maybe
five years from now,

01:13:57.290 --> 01:13:58.457
you could meet the right guy.

01:13:58.459 --> 01:14:00.324
You could. And
maybe that's someone

01:14:00.326 --> 01:14:01.793
who doesn't want
to touch your butt.

01:14:01.795 --> 01:14:03.162
Or maybe you learn to
like it I don't know,

01:14:03.164 --> 01:14:04.797
but I can't just sit around

01:14:04.799 --> 01:14:06.000
and wait for you to hurt me.

01:14:07.268 --> 01:14:09.333
Why would I hurt
you when I love you?

01:14:09.335 --> 01:14:10.401
I don't think that
you can love somebody

01:14:10.403 --> 01:14:11.837
else until you love yourself.

01:14:11.839 --> 01:14:13.372
Well I love myself
when I'm with you.

01:14:13.374 --> 01:14:14.472
Todd this isn't
one of our debates,

01:14:14.474 --> 01:14:15.908
you can't win.

01:14:15.910 --> 01:14:17.109
What if this is
as good as it gets?

01:14:17.111 --> 01:14:18.510
Like that movie "As
Good As It Gets".

01:14:18.512 --> 01:14:21.113
Sometimes something's
gotta give like that movie

01:14:21.115 --> 01:14:22.349
"The Day After Tomorrow".

01:14:28.955 --> 01:14:31.222
Well can you just
tell me what you want

01:14:31.224 --> 01:14:32.160
so I can try?

01:14:36.063 --> 01:14:38.564
I want my own apartment
that accurately represents

01:14:38.566 --> 01:14:40.498
one third of my income,

01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:44.270
and I want my own friends that
are less attractive than me,

01:14:44.272 --> 01:14:46.341
and I want simultaneous orgasms,

01:14:47.842 --> 01:14:49.845
and those are things
you can't give.

01:14:51.580 --> 01:14:53.980
You said you didn't want sex.

01:14:53.982 --> 01:14:55.514
Yeah I changed my mind.

01:14:55.516 --> 01:14:56.851
Well that's not allowed.

01:15:00.287 --> 01:15:02.223
Maybe one day I want kids.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:13.465
Todd, hey Todd.

01:15:13.467 --> 01:15:15.267
Todd come on. Todd don't,

01:15:15.269 --> 01:15:17.570
Todd hey
Todd don't, come on.

01:15:17.572 --> 01:15:19.405
Todd I'm sorry I
don't want kids.

01:15:19.407 --> 01:15:21.173
I don't want kids.
Todd, that was stupid.

01:15:21.175 --> 01:15:23.476
I don't know why I said
that, I'm sorry. Come on.

01:15:25.513 --> 01:15:26.549
Todd.

01:15:30.551 --> 01:15:31.587
Todd.

01:15:35.190 --> 01:15:36.492
Todd I'm sorry.

01:15:38.394 --> 01:15:40.027
I'm sorry I didn't mean it.

01:15:40.029 --> 01:15:42.866
I hate babies. We know
this. Todd, come on.

01:15:46.202 --> 01:15:51.071
Okay, okay. Todd I need
you to breath, alright?

01:15:51.073 --> 01:15:53.276
Just breath for me okay?

01:15:56.578 --> 01:15:57.911
It's okay Todd, it's okay.

01:15:57.913 --> 01:15:58.547
You're gonna be...

01:16:10.359 --> 01:16:11.424
Todd I'm here okay?

01:16:11.426 --> 01:16:13.494
I'm just gonna sit right here,

01:16:13.496 --> 01:16:15.632
but I need you to
breath. Alright?

01:16:17.499 --> 01:16:20.238
I'm right here, I'm just
gonna be right here.

01:16:43.192 --> 01:16:45.626
People say that
finding love is hard.

01:16:45.628 --> 01:16:47.662
Well I did the math.

01:16:47.664 --> 01:16:49.596
There are four million
people living in Los Angeles

01:16:49.598 --> 01:16:51.599
based off the 2010 census.

01:16:51.601 --> 01:16:54.435
Approximately eight percent
of whom are men aged 20 to 30,

01:16:54.437 --> 01:16:57.205
five to 10% of whom
identify as gay or bisexual.

01:16:57.207 --> 01:16:59.107
Of these 32,000 or less men,

01:16:59.109 --> 01:17:00.742
only 10% will have an
IQ of 120 or higher,

01:17:00.744 --> 01:17:02.676
so we can eliminate the
rest let's be honest.

01:17:02.678 --> 01:17:03.711
Of the remaining 3200,

01:17:03.713 --> 01:17:06.113
I will be sexually
incompatible with most of them.

01:17:06.115 --> 01:17:07.615
While there are no
conclusive studies

01:17:07.617 --> 01:17:09.584
on the number of gay men who
abstain from penetrative sex,

01:17:09.586 --> 01:17:11.520
I'm assuming the
number is less than 25%

01:17:11.522 --> 01:17:14.090
especially in my generation
and I think that's generous.

01:17:14.092 --> 01:17:15.524
Now of these 800 men,

01:17:15.526 --> 01:17:17.560
30% will be in long-term
relationships with each other,

01:17:17.562 --> 01:17:19.227
60% will find me unattractive

01:17:19.229 --> 01:17:20.762
either because I'm Asian,
because I have a crooked face,

01:17:20.764 --> 01:17:22.565
or because I'm
generally incorrigible,

01:17:22.567 --> 01:17:24.166
and an additional nine percent

01:17:24.168 --> 01:17:25.633
that can actually
put up with me,

01:17:25.635 --> 01:17:27.470
I will reject outright
over various deal-breakers

01:17:27.472 --> 01:17:28.471
including but not
limited to snoring,

01:17:28.473 --> 01:17:31.440
poor dental hygiene and
or bad taste in movies.

01:17:31.442 --> 01:17:33.508
That only leaves eight potential
could mates on the high end

01:17:33.510 --> 01:17:35.377
and after calculating
he binomial distribution

01:17:35.379 --> 01:17:36.645
for randomly meeting
any one of them

01:17:36.647 --> 01:17:38.014
on any given day over
the next half century

01:17:38.016 --> 01:17:39.547
- Todd.
- and integrating the

01:17:39.549 --> 01:17:40.716
probability mass from zero
to one number of meetings,

01:17:40.718 --> 01:17:43.551
- Todd.
- there is only a .0006%

01:17:43.553 --> 01:17:45.154
chance that I will ever
fall in love which is,

01:17:45.156 --> 01:17:47.256
as I'm sure you can guess,
statistically insignificant.

01:17:47.258 --> 01:17:48.324
- Todd.
- And I'm having

01:17:48.326 --> 01:17:49.658
more compulsions so if
you could please refer me

01:17:49.660 --> 01:17:50.592
to a cognitive
behavioral therapist,

01:17:50.594 --> 01:17:52.028
I'd greatly appreciate it.

01:17:52.030 --> 01:17:53.695
Why don't you
call Dr. Lionetti?

01:17:53.697 --> 01:17:55.297
I don't want him to
know that I'm relapsing.

01:17:55.299 --> 01:17:56.732
He has a very high
opinion of me,

01:17:56.734 --> 01:17:58.301
he said so in our last session.

01:17:58.303 --> 01:18:00.102
Have you considered
that your symptoms

01:18:00.104 --> 01:18:02.405
are being activated
by emotional stress?

01:18:02.407 --> 01:18:03.606
Oh you think
it's psychological?

01:18:03.608 --> 01:18:06.176
Well I guess that's why my
parents pay you the big bucks.

01:18:06.178 --> 01:18:08.110
I'm sorry I know I'm projecting.

01:18:08.112 --> 01:18:09.579
I'm projecting, I'm projecting,

01:18:09.581 --> 01:18:12.214
- I'm projecting.
- If Rory was a man,

01:18:12.216 --> 01:18:14.116
would you still love her?

01:18:14.118 --> 01:18:15.384
What do you mean?

01:18:15.386 --> 01:18:17.820
If you met a man with
all of Rory's qualities,

01:18:17.822 --> 01:18:22.160
her interests, her intellect,
her sense of humor,

01:18:23.295 --> 01:18:26.663
would you consider this
man your soul mate?

01:18:26.665 --> 01:18:28.664
Yes obviously.

01:18:28.666 --> 01:18:31.400
Then Todd I think
you might be gay.

01:18:31.402 --> 01:18:33.169
Like a Kinsey five.

01:18:33.171 --> 01:18:35.504
Okay fine. I'm 'gay'. Is
that what you wanna hear?

01:18:35.506 --> 01:18:36.772
Is that what the
world needs to hear?

01:18:36.774 --> 01:18:38.441
I'm fucking gay?

01:18:38.443 --> 01:18:40.444
I don't have a problem
with being gay,

01:18:40.446 --> 01:18:43.447
I have a problem with being
alone for the rest of my life!

01:18:43.449 --> 01:18:46.720
Well then. I think
we're making progress.

01:18:51.323 --> 01:18:52.589
I mean gay men have
been marrying women

01:18:52.591 --> 01:18:55.094
since sliced bread.

01:18:56.162 --> 01:18:58.032
I don't know what to tell you.

01:18:59.832 --> 01:19:02.767
Maybe Rory's right.
Maybe I don't love myself.

01:19:02.769 --> 01:19:04.735
Maybe I wouldn't have
been loyal to her.

01:19:04.737 --> 01:19:07.237
Now you're just being silly.

01:19:07.239 --> 01:19:08.806
You're like the
definition of loyal.

01:19:08.808 --> 01:19:12.677
You're like that dog Old Yeller.

01:19:12.679 --> 01:19:13.611
Yeah Old Yeller was loyal,

01:19:13.613 --> 01:19:15.545
until he got rabies and
then Travis shot him

01:19:15.547 --> 01:19:17.350
in the face and he died.

01:19:18.885 --> 01:19:20.750
I'm cheating on Zane.

01:19:20.752 --> 01:19:22.186
- What?
- I've been sleeping

01:19:22.188 --> 01:19:24.222
with his other guy.
His name is River.

01:19:24.224 --> 01:19:26.223
He's beautiful,
he has an accent.

01:19:26.225 --> 01:19:27.657
Zane has an accent.

01:19:27.659 --> 01:19:29.794
I know but he didn't
feel foreign to me anymore.

01:19:29.796 --> 01:19:32.130
Don't lecture me,
I know it's fucked.

01:19:32.132 --> 01:19:33.599
Look, Todd my point is,

01:19:33.601 --> 01:19:35.600
I love you but I can't
imagine spending more than

01:19:35.602 --> 01:19:37.669
three days with you at a time.

01:19:37.671 --> 01:19:39.438
That's not a point.

01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:41.540
Zane and I aren't
best friends.

01:19:41.542 --> 01:19:43.642
We don't have have doc
night, we don't bananagram,

01:19:43.644 --> 01:19:46.444
we don't lose track of time
via intense conversation.

01:19:46.446 --> 01:19:48.813
We do lose track of time
via intense fucking,

01:19:48.815 --> 01:19:50.349
but for me that's
easy to come by.

01:19:50.351 --> 01:19:53.221
You know I throw a
penny, I hit a model.

01:19:54.387 --> 01:19:56.156
Can you say the same
thing about Rory?

01:20:01.762 --> 01:20:02.597
Think about it.

01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:08.666
Can we go inside now?

01:20:08.668 --> 01:20:09.503
Thank you.

01:20:31.358 --> 01:20:35.196
Rory. Rory. Rory. Rory.

01:20:48.543 --> 01:20:50.913
Excuse me. Do you work here?

01:21:01.623 --> 01:21:03.256
Hi Karen, it's Rory.

01:21:03.258 --> 01:21:04.660
Just thought I'd
drop you a line.

01:21:06.294 --> 01:21:09.430
Work is good, my boss wanted
me to decorate my cubicle.

01:21:09.432 --> 01:21:10.864
Apparently my lack
of framed photographs

01:21:10.866 --> 01:21:12.298
is darkening her aura,

01:21:12.300 --> 01:21:15.002
so I photoshopped myself
into a fashion spread

01:21:15.004 --> 01:21:16.869
with the cast of "The O.C."
and then she was like,

01:21:16.871 --> 01:21:18.471
"All of your friends are white."

01:21:18.473 --> 01:21:20.341
and I was like, "I
know I'm sorry."

01:21:20.343 --> 01:21:21.909
Oh in 23 days I
qualify for medical

01:21:21.911 --> 01:21:24.011
which is great 'cause I can't
hear certain frequencies

01:21:24.013 --> 01:21:25.712
in my left ear.

01:21:25.714 --> 01:21:27.881
I think I might have like an
acoustic neuroma or something.

01:21:27.883 --> 01:21:28.885
I know I sound like...

01:21:30.486 --> 01:21:32.686
Oh I found this cool website
called SeeYourFolks.com

01:21:32.688 --> 01:21:34.954
and apparently I'm gonna
see you seven more times

01:21:34.956 --> 01:21:36.623
before you die.

01:21:36.625 --> 01:21:38.792
I did say you were living
in the Philippines,

01:21:38.794 --> 01:21:40.664
I know that's temporary but,

01:21:41.863 --> 01:21:43.700
I think it might have
skewed the results.

01:21:46.835 --> 01:21:49.705
Okay call me back. Bye.

01:22:08.457 --> 01:22:10.624
I keep telling them we
need to get a second toaster.

01:22:10.626 --> 01:22:12.729
These traffic jams
are driving me mad.

01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:17.398
You should write up a
cost-benefit analysis.

01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:19.467
When management sees this
loss of employee productivity,

01:22:19.469 --> 01:22:21.372
surely they will
cave to your demands.

01:22:23.607 --> 01:22:25.542
So what kind of
bagel are you having?

01:22:26.576 --> 01:22:28.412
- Sesame.
- Nice.

01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:33.414
What kind of bagel
are you having?

01:22:33.416 --> 01:22:34.251
Garlic.

01:22:36.452 --> 01:22:37.287
Lovely.

01:22:39.323 --> 01:22:41.626
Well I'm not planing on
kissing anyone today so.

01:22:44.729 --> 01:22:45.697
Are you?

01:22:46.631 --> 01:22:48.563
Am I what?

01:22:48.565 --> 01:22:50.568
Do you have plans
to kiss anyone today?

01:22:53.805 --> 01:22:56.374
Nope.

01:22:58.376 --> 01:22:59.642
Nothing on the calendar.

01:23:23.667 --> 01:23:25.800
Hey
you! Answer the door!

01:23:25.802 --> 01:23:27.738
It is a school night!

01:23:28.573 --> 01:23:30.438
Really? I know you're in there,

01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:31.777
you just turned the lights off.

01:23:33.579 --> 01:23:35.479
God why can't you just
have sex for five minutes

01:23:35.481 --> 01:23:36.649
like a normal person?

01:23:49.794 --> 01:23:50.596
Hey Rory.

01:23:51.763 --> 01:23:53.028
Oh hey Craig.

01:23:53.030 --> 01:23:53.997
A bunch of us
are gonna check out

01:23:53.999 --> 01:23:55.732
this new Thai place for lunch.

01:23:55.734 --> 01:23:57.637
It's not a party
unless you're there.

01:23:59.504 --> 01:24:02.171
Yeah. Okay I like Thai.

01:24:02.173 --> 01:24:04.107
Great. We're
about to head over.

01:24:04.109 --> 01:24:06.175
For sure, I'm just
gonna finish this

01:24:06.177 --> 01:24:07.879
and then I'll meet
you guys there.

01:24:09.647 --> 01:24:11.417
Don't work too
hard Rory Gilmore.

01:24:12.584 --> 01:24:14.451
You watch "Gilmore Girls"?

01:24:14.453 --> 01:24:16.787
Oh yeah, yeah I own like
all the seasons on DVD.

01:24:16.789 --> 01:24:17.623
Me too.

01:24:21.794 --> 01:24:24.030
Hey Craig, random question.

01:24:24.897 --> 01:24:26.564
Hit me.

01:24:26.566 --> 01:24:28.733
If somebody had
a gun to your head

01:24:28.735 --> 01:24:30.667
and they said "Kill this baby

01:24:30.669 --> 01:24:32.703
or I'm gonna kill you",
what would you do?

01:24:32.705 --> 01:24:34.605
- What baby?
- There's a baby on the floor.

01:24:34.607 --> 01:24:35.873
It's just lying on the floor?

01:24:35.875 --> 01:24:38.443
Okay it's on a shelf
but you have a gun,

01:24:38.445 --> 01:24:40.011
and you can either kill
the baby or you get shot.

01:24:40.013 --> 01:24:42.680
Can't I just kill the guy
with the gun pointed to my head?

01:24:42.682 --> 01:24:43.713
No he's too fast,

01:24:43.715 --> 01:24:44.681
he's like James Bond.

01:24:44.683 --> 01:24:45.583
Why would James Bond
make me kill a baby?

01:24:45.585 --> 01:24:47.788
It's a hypothetical
situation Craig.

01:24:51.758 --> 01:24:55.525
I mean I guess I
would, save the baby.

01:24:55.527 --> 01:24:57.630
I don't think I could
live with the guilt.

01:25:00.500 --> 01:25:01.632
Yeah.

01:25:01.634 --> 01:25:03.568
Why, what would you do?

01:25:03.570 --> 01:25:07.776
Oh I would save
the baby obviously.

01:25:09.609 --> 01:25:12.781
You're so funny
Rory.

01:25:53.621 --> 01:25:55.958
Excuse me.
Do you work here?

01:25:57.626 --> 01:25:58.627
Todd?

01:26:00.028 --> 01:26:01.960
What are you doing here?

01:26:01.962 --> 01:26:03.963
How did you find me?

01:26:03.965 --> 01:26:05.298
Your landlord called
me for a reference check,

01:26:05.300 --> 01:26:06.900
she had your employer
info on file.

01:26:06.902 --> 01:26:08.166
She just gave it to you?

01:26:08.168 --> 01:26:09.602
Well her English
wasn't very good.

01:26:09.604 --> 01:26:11.137
Yeah I think she's Bulgarian.

01:26:11.139 --> 01:26:12.604
I would've guessed Hungarian.

01:26:12.606 --> 01:26:13.540
What's the difference?

01:26:13.542 --> 01:26:15.008
Well Hungarians can't
make the 'th' sound.

01:26:15.010 --> 01:26:16.174
- The what?
- The 'th' sound.

01:26:16.176 --> 01:26:17.710
Okay nevermind Todd

01:26:17.712 --> 01:26:18.844
how did you even get to Seattle?

01:26:18.846 --> 01:26:22.315
Did you, did you take a plane?

01:26:22.317 --> 01:26:23.618
Yes. For you.

01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:25.852
- Really?
- No I drove.

01:26:25.854 --> 01:26:27.120
It took me three days.

01:26:27.122 --> 01:26:28.086
I had to book a hotel in
Sacramento and Medford.

01:26:28.088 --> 01:26:29.187
Look you called me.

01:26:29.189 --> 01:26:30.656
No, no I didn't.

01:26:30.658 --> 01:26:32.325
- Yes you did.
- My butt, my butt dialed you.

01:26:32.327 --> 01:26:34.727
Well I think your butt
knows what your heart wants.

01:26:34.729 --> 01:26:35.628
I think you called
me like that episode

01:26:35.630 --> 01:26:37.330
of "Gilmore Girls"
where Lorelei calls Luke

01:26:37.332 --> 01:26:38.764
like that movie
"The Way We Were"

01:26:38.766 --> 01:26:39.665
where Barbra Streisand
calls Robert Redford

01:26:39.667 --> 01:26:41.034
because she really
needed her best friend.

01:26:41.036 --> 01:26:42.268
Todd, this is too meta for me.

01:26:42.270 --> 01:26:43.737
I'm your best friend,

01:26:43.739 --> 01:26:45.639
and I just wanna
be the way we were.

01:26:45.641 --> 01:26:46.807
You know how that
movie ends right?

01:26:46.809 --> 01:26:49.178
Yes and it sucked,
and that's why.

01:26:50.779 --> 01:26:54.717
And that's why.

01:26:58.119 --> 01:27:01.220
Todd what is this?

01:27:01.222 --> 01:27:03.756
- It's our song.
- I have never heard this song

01:27:03.758 --> 01:27:04.959
in my life.

01:27:04.961 --> 01:27:05.960
Well every rainbow

01:27:05.962 --> 01:27:07.763
- has to start somewhere.
- What?

01:27:08.964 --> 01:27:11.230
Todd, how long have these
people been out there?

01:27:11.232 --> 01:27:12.765
Were they one per tree?

01:27:12.767 --> 01:27:14.033
What if I didn't show up?

01:27:14.035 --> 01:27:16.036
What if I worked late
or snuck out the back

01:27:16.038 --> 01:27:17.540
and carpooled to Chipotle?

01:27:18.807 --> 01:27:20.644
- I don't know.
- You're crazy.

01:27:21.811 --> 01:27:23.280
People do crazy things

01:27:24.646 --> 01:27:27.684
- when they're in love.
- When they're in love.

01:27:32.688 --> 01:27:34.689
Todd, Todd what are you doing?

01:27:34.691 --> 01:27:35.657
Rory I love you.

01:27:35.659 --> 01:27:38.292
- Get up, Todd!
- I will always love you.

01:27:38.294 --> 01:27:40.060
And I know that you're scared
that I'm going to hurt you,

01:27:40.062 --> 01:27:41.261
so I'm giving you

01:27:41.263 --> 01:27:42.063
- my guarantee.
- That better not

01:27:42.065 --> 01:27:42.863
be a ring or I'm gonna...

01:27:42.865 --> 01:27:44.733
Rory will you...

01:27:44.735 --> 01:27:45.667
- What, no!
- You didn't even

01:27:45.669 --> 01:27:47.902
- let me finish.
- No I will not marry you!

01:27:47.904 --> 01:27:50.005
- Why?
- I am not discussing...

01:27:50.007 --> 01:27:52.640
Okay. They need to leave.

01:27:52.642 --> 01:27:54.244
Whoever they are. Do
you know these people?

01:27:55.779 --> 01:27:59.346
Great. Okay, hi.
Excuse me I'm sorry,

01:27:59.348 --> 01:28:01.082
but this is just a
big misunderstanding.

01:28:01.084 --> 01:28:03.784
You're all very talented
but show's over.

01:28:03.786 --> 01:28:05.956
Okay, time to go home.
All seven of you.

01:28:07.089 --> 01:28:09.759
Okay thank
you. Drive safe.

01:28:20.671 --> 01:28:23.004
Todd. I'm not ready for this,

01:28:23.006 --> 01:28:23.939
this is too soon.

01:28:23.941 --> 01:28:26.107
Well are you even happy here?

01:28:26.109 --> 01:28:28.613
- Overall yes.
- Oh. Well,

01:28:31.049 --> 01:28:31.883
do you love me?

01:28:34.018 --> 01:28:34.853
No.

01:28:43.326 --> 01:28:45.327
Look, I know that you're
worried I'm gonna meet

01:28:45.329 --> 01:28:46.462
the perfect guy some day,

01:28:46.464 --> 01:28:49.267
but I promise you I won't
because he doesn't exist.

01:28:50.468 --> 01:28:51.833
Sure we all like to think
there's this soul mate

01:28:51.835 --> 01:28:53.269
out there for us who's
going to complete

01:28:53.271 --> 01:28:55.370
us intellectually and
physically and emotionally,

01:28:55.372 --> 01:28:57.806
but the harsh reality is
not everybody gets that.

01:28:57.808 --> 01:28:58.973
So two out of
three isn't so bad.

01:28:58.975 --> 01:29:00.810
I mean, if your blind
or schizophrenic

01:29:00.812 --> 01:29:02.043
or you're missing
an arm and a leg,

01:29:02.045 --> 01:29:03.279
you might not even
get one out of three

01:29:03.281 --> 01:29:04.379
and you just have
to accept that.

01:29:04.381 --> 01:29:06.347
And I know that that's an
offensive thing to say,

01:29:06.349 --> 01:29:08.819
but you agree with
me, you agree with me.

01:29:08.821 --> 01:29:11.053
And anyway I had accepted
that, that I would never

01:29:11.055 --> 01:29:13.723
find anybody because I
admit that I'm finicky,

01:29:13.725 --> 01:29:15.925
but then I met you and
I don't have to scour

01:29:15.927 --> 01:29:18.160
the ends of the earth to know
beyond a reasonable doubt

01:29:18.162 --> 01:29:19.495
that you're the one.

01:29:19.497 --> 01:29:21.231
I already know.

01:29:21.233 --> 01:29:22.865
You're the only person
I like arguing with

01:29:22.867 --> 01:29:25.435
and you're the only person
I don't mind losing to,

01:29:25.437 --> 01:29:28.006
and you're the only
person I can't lose.

01:29:29.407 --> 01:29:31.107
And so maybe we won't have
the greatest sex ever,

01:29:31.109 --> 01:29:33.175
but you know, I mean
I can try harder.

01:29:33.177 --> 01:29:34.410
I mean if Helen Keller
can learn to talk,

01:29:34.412 --> 01:29:36.045
I can learn to eat you out,

01:29:36.047 --> 01:29:38.347
and I just, I honestly
think that we could be happy

01:29:38.349 --> 01:29:41.450
for the rest of our lives
because I wanna watch you die.

01:29:41.452 --> 01:29:43.919
I mean, I wanna see
you through to the end.

01:29:43.921 --> 01:29:46.222
In sickness, and in health and
you know that that says a lot

01:29:46.224 --> 01:29:48.924
because I don't like
sickness or endings or poop

01:29:48.926 --> 01:29:50.826
and you know this, but you know,

01:29:50.828 --> 01:29:52.361
if you had cancer
and you needed help,

01:29:52.363 --> 01:29:53.929
I mean ideally I'll have a
nurse to help deal with that,

01:29:53.931 --> 01:29:55.198
but if it was an emergency

01:29:55.200 --> 01:29:56.433
and you did number
two in your pants,

01:29:56.435 --> 01:29:58.469
I would clean you up
because I love you

01:29:58.471 --> 01:30:00.340
and I want you to be my wife.

01:30:07.180 --> 01:30:10.417
I'm sorry.

01:30:16.922 --> 01:30:19.490
Baby if you love me,

01:30:19.492 --> 01:30:23.096
won't you please just
just give me a smile?

01:30:24.029 --> 01:30:26.496
Baby if you love me,

01:30:26.498 --> 01:30:30.233
won't you please just
just give me a smile?

01:30:30.235 --> 01:30:31.904
Baby if you love me,

01:30:33.072 --> 01:30:37.778
won't you please
just give me a smile?

01:30:38.511 --> 01:30:40.178
Baby if you love me,

01:30:40.180 --> 01:30:42.881
won't you please
just give me a smile?

01:30:49.222 --> 01:30:52.123
Please, please give me a smile.

01:30:52.125 --> 01:30:54.458
Baby if you love me,

01:30:54.460 --> 01:30:57.528
won't you please
just give me a smile?

01:30:57.530 --> 01:31:00.400
Rory come on!

01:31:01.569 --> 01:31:03.972
Baby if you love me,

01:31:05.606 --> 01:31:07.542
won't you please
just give me a smile?

01:31:29.463 --> 01:31:31.431
- Sonder.
- That's a great word.

01:31:31.433 --> 01:31:33.565
I didn't have a moment
of sonder until last year.

01:31:33.567 --> 01:31:36.535
That's okay, you have
other good qualities.

01:31:36.537 --> 01:31:38.503
- Schadenfreude obviously.
- Or Jouska.

01:31:38.505 --> 01:31:40.206
What's Jouska?

01:31:40.208 --> 01:31:41.407
Jouska is when you replay
a hypothetical dialogue

01:31:41.409 --> 01:31:42.507
over and over
again in your head,

01:31:42.509 --> 01:31:43.943
like winning an argument,

01:31:43.945 --> 01:31:45.578
or getting interviewed
by Conan O'Brien.

01:31:45.580 --> 01:31:46.546
There's a word for that?

01:31:46.548 --> 01:31:48.248
There's a word for everything.

01:31:48.250 --> 01:31:49.548
I wonder if there's a
word that exactly describes

01:31:49.550 --> 01:31:50.516
the feeling when you
learn there's a word

01:31:50.518 --> 01:31:52.185
that exactly describes
what you're feeling.

01:31:52.187 --> 01:31:54.386
If there is, I
bet it's French.

01:31:54.388 --> 01:31:55.654
What are we talking about?

01:31:55.656 --> 01:31:57.457
Specific words to
describe obscure emotions.

01:31:57.459 --> 01:31:58.494
Oh.

01:32:00.294 --> 01:32:01.360
DÃ©jÃ  vu.

01:32:01.362 --> 01:32:02.865
We already said that.

01:32:03.632 --> 01:32:05.597
- Cauliphrenia.
- What's that?

01:32:05.599 --> 01:32:08.368
Well Cauliphrenia
is the feeling when

01:32:08.370 --> 01:32:10.535
you eat the last bite
of something delicious

01:32:10.537 --> 01:32:14.309
and you become sad because
you can no longer eat it.

01:32:15.677 --> 01:32:16.642
How do you spell that?

01:32:16.644 --> 01:32:17.478
He's lying.

01:32:18.581 --> 01:32:19.446
You're such a tattletale.

01:32:19.448 --> 01:32:21.181
Yeah you'd get
shanked in prison, Todd.

01:32:21.183 --> 01:32:22.415
Oh imagine all the new things

01:32:22.417 --> 01:32:24.584
you'd get to try if you
were someone's bitch.

01:32:24.586 --> 01:32:26.453
Hey Todd, remember
when you were

01:32:26.455 --> 01:32:28.524
gonna learn how to eat me out?

01:32:31.693 --> 01:32:33.127
I wish there was
a word to describe

01:32:33.129 --> 01:32:34.130
how I'm feeling now.

01:32:38.701 --> 01:32:40.301
You guys ready?

01:32:40.303 --> 01:32:41.136
Ready.

01:32:42.071 --> 01:32:43.503
Split.
