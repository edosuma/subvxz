WEBVTT

00:36.411 --> 00:37.787
You okay, honey?

00:37.871 --> 00:38.788
Mm-hm.

00:46.254 --> 00:47.714
You want to come sleep with me?

00:47.797 --> 00:48.840
Yeah.

00:50.633 --> 00:51.718
Okay, honey.

00:52.260 --> 00:53.678
Oh, come on, come on.

02:12.549 --> 02:13.633
Okay, okay.

02:37.282 --> 02:38.116
Honey.

02:43.288 --> 02:44.706
One more time. Big breath.

02:49.252 --> 02:51.087
Breathe. Breathe.

02:57.635 --> 03:00.346
-Come on, Mom, where are you? Uh...

03:00.430 --> 03:02.640
Maddy's still real sick
and I have to go to work,

03:02.724 --> 03:05.518
and Sean has to go to work.
Please call me back.

03:11.065 --> 03:13.484
-No!
-Hey, Yolanda.

03:13.568 --> 03:16.029
You're not calling out sick, no way.

03:16.112 --> 03:20.450
I'm really sorry, yeah.
She's still very, very sick.

03:20.533 --> 03:23.203
Give her a hot toddy! Or quit.
I don't care.

03:23.286 --> 03:25.663
You got to stop calling out sick on me.

03:25.747 --> 03:29.125
I have you and Kelly on a big job.
I need you today.

03:36.966 --> 03:37.884
Okay.

03:39.093 --> 03:39.928
Okay.

03:40.803 --> 03:43.014
-I'll be there.
-Don't be late.

03:44.057 --> 03:45.350
Thanks, then. Bye.

03:57.820 --> 03:58.655
Hey, honey.

04:00.782 --> 04:02.867
You're gonna have to go to daycare.

04:04.535 --> 04:06.120
I'm really sorry.

04:15.213 --> 04:16.756
Hey, Luis.

04:18.216 --> 04:20.927
Can you take a look at my wall today?
It's getting worse.

04:21.010 --> 04:23.513
Yeah, it's been raining a lot, mama.

04:23.596 --> 04:27.267
You could grow mushrooms.
It's wet to the touch.

04:28.059 --> 04:30.395
The sun's gonna be out soon. It's good.

04:30.478 --> 04:31.521
Dry it out.

04:32.397 --> 04:35.191
Can you look, please?
'Cause it reeks of mold.

04:35.275 --> 04:38.653
-Pretty sure that it's in the walls.
-Well, listen.

04:39.487 --> 04:42.448
All you've got to do
is just open those windows up,

04:43.157 --> 04:44.200
let fresh air in.

04:45.034 --> 04:48.621
She's never gonna get better
if she's breathing in moldy air.

04:49.831 --> 04:51.749
Okay. I'll check it out again.

04:51.833 --> 04:53.584
-Today?
-I'll try.

04:54.335 --> 04:57.046
-Thank you.
-Baby needs a tissue.

05:06.556 --> 05:08.391
You're gonna have so much fun.

05:08.474 --> 05:11.144
Oh, my God, look at that nose.

05:12.228 --> 05:13.104
Sorry, Rose.

05:14.230 --> 05:17.567
Can't seem to shake this cold.
But no fever, so...

05:18.192 --> 05:19.986
We need your co-pay before you go.

05:20.069 --> 05:23.323
I missed some work
with her sick, but I'll have it by Friday.

05:23.406 --> 05:24.991
You said that last week.

05:26.242 --> 05:30.246
You're getting my daycare grant money,
right? From WCCC?

05:30.330 --> 05:32.999
Yeah, but that only covers
part of tuition.

05:33.541 --> 05:34.917
We need your co-pay.

05:35.960 --> 05:37.879
Yeah, I'll have it to you by Friday.

05:37.962 --> 05:40.381
Did you pack Kleenex,
or did you forget that too?

05:41.174 --> 05:43.509
Got a roll of toilet paper,
right here in the bag.

05:45.678 --> 05:48.514
All right, bunny,
it's time for me to go, okay?

05:49.807 --> 05:51.809
You love Rose.
You're gonna have so much fun.

05:51.893 --> 05:54.312
-Mommy, don't go.
-I know. You got to let go, honey.

05:54.395 --> 05:57.648
Yes, it's okay. I know, I know, I know.

05:57.732 --> 05:59.984
You've got this, angel. It's Rose!

06:00.068 --> 06:02.028
-We love her.
-No.

06:04.906 --> 06:07.367
I'm sorry, I really wish
I didn't have to work today.

06:07.992 --> 06:09.035
Me too.

06:11.329 --> 06:12.705
Hey, I love you!

07:16.811 --> 07:19.313
You have arrived at your destination.

07:35.037 --> 07:36.664
I'm sorry. I know I'm late!

07:36.747 --> 07:38.624
My God, just tell me already.

07:38.708 --> 07:40.126
No, you've got to guess.

07:41.711 --> 07:44.464
-Are we unloading all this?
-Yeah, grab the Rug Doctor.

07:44.547 --> 07:47.675
-Guess!
-What are we guessing?

07:47.758 --> 07:49.469
Famous person used to live here,

07:49.552 --> 07:51.762
and Yolanda won't tell me who.

07:53.097 --> 07:55.641
-Was it a serial killer?
-Nope.

07:55.725 --> 07:57.226
Is it the clown, from It?

07:57.852 --> 07:59.061
That's fictional.

07:59.145 --> 08:00.771
It's Barefoot Billy.

08:00.855 --> 08:02.273
The kid burglar?

08:02.356 --> 08:05.193
Yeah, he's not a real celebrity.
Thumbs down.

08:05.276 --> 08:07.653
There was a multi-state manhunt
for the boy.

08:07.737 --> 08:09.405
Broke into every home on the island.

08:09.489 --> 08:10.948
Yeah, for Doritos.

08:11.032 --> 08:12.158
Who gives a shit?

08:12.825 --> 08:15.286
Hey, guys, do you want to start soon?

08:15.369 --> 08:18.581
This is where his mom lived,
until she died last week.

08:18.664 --> 08:21.667
No kin, so they're doing an estate sale.

08:21.751 --> 08:23.753
Realtor's booked us for a three-day clean.

08:23.836 --> 08:27.048
Do you think Barefoot Billy
knows his mom is dead?

08:27.798 --> 08:30.343
Probably not. He's still a fugitive.

08:30.426 --> 08:33.554
Nobody's seen him
around these parts in years.

08:34.764 --> 08:35.890
Until today.

08:37.099 --> 08:39.018
When he comes to avenge his mother's death

08:39.101 --> 08:42.271
by murdering unsuspecting maids.

08:43.898 --> 08:47.193
All right, girls.
Have fun, do Value Maids proud.

08:47.276 --> 08:50.112
-Wait, you're not helping us?
-You're my A-team.

08:50.780 --> 08:51.989
You got this.

09:05.753 --> 09:07.630
Think these are worth anything?

09:22.144 --> 09:24.814
Yeah, I think some of these
could be valuable.

09:24.897 --> 09:28.526
I'll split them 60-40.
I get 60 'cause I saw them first.

09:33.364 --> 09:34.824
Good choice.

09:34.907 --> 09:38.286
I'm not stealing this. This is a Nazi.

09:39.453 --> 09:41.747
See his little swastikas on his arms?

09:42.873 --> 09:44.417
Who'd collect that?

09:45.293 --> 09:48.462
Well, I'm taking her TV, then.
Fuck this bitch.

09:50.381 --> 09:53.551
You don't think the Realtor's
gonna notice that the TV's gone?

09:53.634 --> 09:54.468
Doubt it.

09:56.387 --> 09:57.221
Okay.

09:59.015 --> 10:03.811
I'm not gonna say anything if you do,
but I don't want any part of it.

10:03.894 --> 10:06.314
My God, what are you? Good?

10:06.397 --> 10:07.398
Sorry.

10:08.983 --> 10:10.443
You want upstairs or downstairs?

10:10.526 --> 10:13.487
Let's flip for it.
Heads, you take dead mom's room.

10:13.571 --> 10:15.573
Tails, you take dead mom's room.

10:16.115 --> 10:18.117
Okay, I'll take dead mom's room.

12:12.231 --> 12:13.607
Kelly!

12:14.233 --> 12:15.109
What?

12:15.818 --> 12:16.652
Hey, look.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.821
The locks are on the outside of the door.

12:19.405 --> 12:21.073
Outside. Cool.

12:22.533 --> 12:25.786
No, look, it's to lock somebody in.

12:28.789 --> 12:30.875
Why would somebody
lock a kid in their room?

12:30.958 --> 12:32.460
Oh, I could top that.

12:32.543 --> 12:35.129
You should see the creepy shit
going on in the kitchen.

12:35.212 --> 12:37.631
Lock. Lock. Lock.

12:37.715 --> 12:40.551
And there's a lock on the pantry too.

12:41.260 --> 12:42.928
You think it's a diet thing?

12:44.972 --> 12:48.642
No, I think she locked up her food
like she locked up her son.

12:50.019 --> 12:52.313
No wonder
William's so obsessed with junk food.

12:52.396 --> 12:53.272
William?

12:53.981 --> 12:58.736
Yeah. Barefoot Billy's real name.
William Harlan Ritchie.

12:58.819 --> 13:00.780
What are you? Dating?

13:02.406 --> 13:04.867
-I saw it in his mom's room.
-I've got to take a dump.

13:54.458 --> 13:55.292
Fuck.

14:06.470 --> 14:09.807
-Happy Giggles Daycare.
-Hi, it's Maddy's mom. What's wrong?

14:09.890 --> 14:11.976
We've been trying to reach you.

14:12.059 --> 14:14.478
-Maddy came down with a fever.
-Shit.

14:14.562 --> 14:17.815
Uh, okay, I'm in Whitney,
but I'll be there in 40 minutes.

14:17.898 --> 14:20.150
No, we had to send her home.

14:20.234 --> 14:23.237
She can't be here with a fever.
Her grandfather picked her up.

14:24.822 --> 14:26.448
What? Um...

14:27.992 --> 14:30.244
Why would you call my dad?
My dad's not a contact.

14:30.327 --> 14:32.246
Maddy's dad authorized it.

14:32.329 --> 14:36.250
He couldn't leave work. We tried you
and your mom for half an hour.

14:36.333 --> 14:38.294
Hey, Kelly!
I have an emergency with my kid.

14:38.377 --> 14:39.920
Will you grab my shit, please?

15:03.235 --> 15:05.654
She's fine. Fever broke.

15:07.740 --> 15:08.991
I'm so sorry.

15:09.950 --> 15:10.826
Don't be.

15:11.827 --> 15:13.579
She's asleep in the twins' room.

15:34.183 --> 15:35.142
There you go.

15:37.144 --> 15:38.270
Thank you so much.

15:38.354 --> 15:40.397
It's a peppermint mocha-chino.

15:41.065 --> 15:42.399
Yeah. Uh...

15:42.483 --> 15:45.444
Next time I'm gonna make sure
I put my phone on vibrate.

15:45.527 --> 15:47.237
I'm really sorry about this.

15:47.321 --> 15:49.698
Hey, we're happy to help. Right?

15:49.782 --> 15:50.783
So happy.

15:50.866 --> 15:53.535
If you want,
we can watch her again tomorrow?

15:54.411 --> 15:57.164
Daycare said she couldn't come back
for another 24 hours.

15:58.082 --> 16:00.834
Oh, no, I'm not gonna
put you guys out, thank you, but...

16:01.543 --> 16:02.962
me and Sean will figure it out.

16:04.254 --> 16:06.548
I should go ahead and get her now.

16:06.632 --> 16:09.885
You know what?
She just went down like half an hour ago.

16:09.969 --> 16:12.137
Just let the little lamb sleep.

16:14.682 --> 16:16.642
Know what?
What are the twins doing, anyway?

16:16.725 --> 16:19.436
-Rude of them not to say hi.
-No, don't worry about it.

16:19.520 --> 16:21.981
Addison! Abigail!

16:23.774 --> 16:24.608
Hey!

16:24.692 --> 16:27.152
You guys remember
your half-sister, Alex, right?

16:27.236 --> 16:29.029
This is Maddy's mom.

16:30.406 --> 16:31.573
Hey, guys.

16:34.410 --> 16:35.494
Nice weapons.

16:36.662 --> 16:39.331
Yeah, okay. Go ahead. Go on and play.

16:43.377 --> 16:47.172
They're just a little shy
around strangers.

16:47.256 --> 16:48.757
Not that you're a--

16:49.633 --> 16:52.177
It's just-- You don't come around much.

16:52.261 --> 16:53.095
Yeah.

16:53.762 --> 16:55.681
Not for lack of invitations.

16:59.727 --> 17:01.979
Uh, when was I invited?

17:03.564 --> 17:05.441
You have an open invite, you know that.

17:08.986 --> 17:12.156
I guess I didn't really know that.
Yeah. Uh...

17:13.907 --> 17:15.492
Thought I was unwelcome.

17:17.911 --> 17:19.747
Who told you that? Your mother?

17:23.751 --> 17:24.626
Yeah.

17:26.086 --> 17:30.799
Yeah, yeah, I, uh... I'm misremembering.

17:30.883 --> 17:32.676
I'm gonna go ahead and get Maddy,

17:32.760 --> 17:35.262
but thank you guys so much for everything.

17:37.556 --> 17:39.141
Yeah, no, we're out of them...

17:42.352 --> 17:43.270
Hi, how many?

17:44.313 --> 17:48.067
Uh, no, sorry.
This is Sean's daughter, Maddy.

17:48.650 --> 17:50.736
Hi. I'm Frankie.

17:51.779 --> 17:52.821
Is Sean around?

17:53.447 --> 17:55.240
Yeah. In the kitchen.

17:55.324 --> 17:56.158
Hold on.

18:07.669 --> 18:08.545
Hey.

18:08.629 --> 18:10.881
Why did you tell the daycare
to call my dad?

18:12.049 --> 18:13.884
You and your mom were AWOL.

18:14.593 --> 18:17.805
-How are you feeling, Mad-dog?
-So why didn't you pick her up, Sean?

18:18.680 --> 18:22.059
Because I was alone behind the bar.
And we were slammed.

18:22.142 --> 18:23.143
It was lunch.

18:23.769 --> 18:26.772
Besides, she loves Grandpa.
Don't you, Mad?

18:27.314 --> 18:30.275
-I don't want my dad watching Maddy.
-Behind you.

18:34.363 --> 18:36.281
I don't know
why you're so weird about him.

18:37.282 --> 18:39.868
Like, he seems like
a nice enough guy to me.

18:39.952 --> 18:42.412
-You don't know my dad.
-Neither do you.

18:43.872 --> 18:46.208
You and your mom left
when you were, what, 5?

18:48.544 --> 18:52.548
Okay, Maddy needs to stay home
from daycare tomorrow and I'm working.

18:52.631 --> 18:55.592
-Can you watch her?
-I can't, I'm working a double.

18:57.511 --> 19:00.013
Okay, can you get somebody
to switch with you?

19:00.097 --> 19:02.391
Can't she cover for you?

19:03.183 --> 19:06.353
Frankie's a server,
not a bartender, and, uh...

19:06.436 --> 19:10.649
Look, it's off-season.
I can't afford to miss another shift.

19:11.441 --> 19:13.485
I'm gonna get fired
if I call in sick again.

19:13.569 --> 19:15.404
But it's okay for me to get fired?

19:16.446 --> 19:18.240
Nobody asked you to get a job.

19:18.323 --> 19:20.284
Can we at least split the day?

19:21.618 --> 19:23.954
-You take her until 3--
-I'm working a double.

19:24.037 --> 19:25.831
Could you come in late until I--

19:25.914 --> 19:28.667
I'm working a double.

19:28.750 --> 19:31.378
Wait, I'm confused.
Are you working a double?

19:33.213 --> 19:34.965
Just take her to your dad's.

19:35.507 --> 19:37.176
A nice house, a nice wife,

19:37.259 --> 19:41.346
and he wants to be a part
of Maddy's life. I don't see the big deal!

19:41.430 --> 19:43.932
Okay, bye, Mad-dog, Daddy loves you!

19:44.558 --> 19:45.559
Feel better.

19:54.359 --> 19:55.611
Mom!

19:59.031 --> 20:02.075
I don't think she's here,
'cause the car's not here.

20:02.159 --> 20:04.578
Why does she always go "poof"
when we need her?

20:07.206 --> 20:09.750
Hey, shall we go home,
get some cuddles in?

20:14.630 --> 20:17.841
All right, let's get these mittens on.
What do you say?

20:19.009 --> 20:20.010
Come here, kitty.

20:22.471 --> 20:23.430
Please.

20:24.348 --> 20:27.768
Very cold in here, and we've got to get
that moldy air out

20:27.851 --> 20:29.144
and fresh air in.

20:40.656 --> 20:41.949
Mommy.

20:43.242 --> 20:44.243
Honey.

20:44.993 --> 20:45.953
I know.

20:46.036 --> 20:47.955
You're freezing, I'm so sorry.

20:50.707 --> 20:53.669
Over the course
of an epic four-year crime spree,

20:53.752 --> 20:57.089
William Harlan Ritchie
burgled almost 50 homes,

20:57.172 --> 20:59.383
often leaving behind muddy footprints.

20:59.466 --> 21:02.636
Barefoot Billy was the only son
of Louise Alva Ritchie,

21:02.719 --> 21:04.346
who lived in this house.

21:04.429 --> 21:06.807
Billy was in and out
of juvenile detention centers

21:06.890 --> 21:08.267
throughout his early teens,

21:08.350 --> 21:10.018
but his rap sheet starts to pick up

21:10.102 --> 21:12.437
when he escapes from his final foster home

21:12.521 --> 21:16.275
and the young fugitive
started living here, in the woods.

21:19.903 --> 21:22.906
From this vantage point,
Barefoot Billy could case a house

21:22.990 --> 21:25.284
for several days before making a move.

21:26.076 --> 21:28.245
He would case his intended victims,

21:28.328 --> 21:32.249
studying the family's habits,
movements and schedule.

21:35.460 --> 21:36.712
Alex!

21:36.795 --> 21:37.921
-Mom?
-Alex!

22:45.572 --> 22:47.115
This one's infected.

22:47.199 --> 22:48.200
Again?

22:48.283 --> 22:50.869
I'll call in another round
of antibiotics for you.

22:51.620 --> 22:53.914
What are your living conditions like?

22:54.498 --> 22:58.919
Uh, we are in a temporary
housing apartment with a mold problem.

22:59.002 --> 23:00.462
This one's infected too.

23:03.006 --> 23:04.674
Why aren't the antibiotics working?

23:04.758 --> 23:06.968
Because they can only do so much.

23:07.677 --> 23:09.763
Are you keeping her out of daycare?

23:10.389 --> 23:11.431
I have to work.

23:11.515 --> 23:14.851
She needs rest, Ms. Russell.
Somewhere warm and dry.

23:14.935 --> 23:19.189
Your landlord is required by law
to do everything to remove the mold.

23:19.272 --> 23:22.943
I've asked, yeah.
I don't think they're gonna do anything.

23:24.069 --> 23:25.654
Then you need to move.

23:26.655 --> 23:28.698
I can't afford anything else.

23:30.033 --> 23:31.993
Well, she needs you to do better.

23:42.963 --> 23:45.048
Hello, ladies. Come on in.

23:46.091 --> 23:49.428
Thank you so much.
I really appreciate this.

23:49.511 --> 23:51.680
Russell Family Inn. We love it, don't we?

23:51.763 --> 23:54.933
-We love it.
-Hopefully just a couple of nights.

23:55.016 --> 23:56.935
I'm waiting to hear back from my super.

23:57.018 --> 23:59.479
You can't stay in a place with black mold.
It's toxic.

23:59.563 --> 24:01.064
Oh, you...

24:01.148 --> 24:03.859
Give me that little dolly. Hey.

24:03.942 --> 24:05.152
Oh!

24:05.235 --> 24:08.530
We have got a whole sick bay
set up, do you know that?

24:08.613 --> 24:12.617
We've got Toy Story 2.
And we've got star soup.

24:13.326 --> 24:16.371
-And how about a rainbow popsicle?

24:16.455 --> 24:18.331
Oh, that sounds good.

24:18.415 --> 24:20.041
You want to say, "Bye, Mom"?

24:20.125 --> 24:22.586
I love you so much, Mad.
I'm gonna be back soon, okay?

24:22.669 --> 24:24.296
Say, "Bye, bye, bye."

24:26.006 --> 24:28.425
I should be back around 3,
if that's okay with you.

24:28.508 --> 24:31.011
Hang out for a bit. I want to talk to you.

24:31.094 --> 24:33.346
Kids, let's go! Time for youth group.

24:34.055 --> 24:37.267
-I do have to get to--
-One minute... for your old man.

24:37.934 --> 24:38.768
Okay?

24:40.020 --> 24:41.271
Go and have a seat.

24:42.856 --> 24:44.065
Okay.

25:01.249 --> 25:02.667
Okay. Ready?

25:08.340 --> 25:09.633
-Amen.
-Amen.

25:09.716 --> 25:10.592
All right.

25:11.468 --> 25:13.094
You guys have a great day.

25:19.184 --> 25:20.560
The mold you see?

25:21.853 --> 25:23.980
That's just the tip of the iceberg.

25:24.064 --> 25:26.233
They'll have to rip out insulation,

25:26.316 --> 25:28.193
pull up the carpets. The whole deal.

25:30.946 --> 25:35.158
Uh, I... can't even wrap my mind
around that right now.

25:35.242 --> 25:36.284
Look...

25:38.828 --> 25:41.498
I've been thinking about you... a lot.

25:43.250 --> 25:47.295
Ever since I dropped you off
at the ferry station that night. I, um...

25:47.379 --> 25:49.839
should have insisted you come stay here.

25:51.383 --> 25:52.384
That's okay.

25:53.552 --> 25:55.637
Been bugging me I didn't do that.

25:57.597 --> 25:58.515
Point is...

25:59.516 --> 26:01.601
you can stay as long as you want.

26:02.143 --> 26:04.688
Weeks. Months, even.

26:06.189 --> 26:07.691
You're invited.

26:08.984 --> 26:10.151
Sharlene agrees.

26:13.947 --> 26:14.823
Thank you.

26:16.324 --> 26:18.451
I really, really appreciate that.

26:21.705 --> 26:25.292
I'd usually crash at Mom's,
but she's MIA right now, so...

26:26.751 --> 26:28.169
Yeah? How long?

26:29.546 --> 26:30.463
Uh...

26:31.590 --> 26:32.799
Snuck up on me.

26:32.882 --> 26:36.469
I've been so busy with Maddy, but...
three or four weeks.

26:37.012 --> 26:38.471
She single right now?

26:40.390 --> 26:42.017
No, she's dating somebody.

26:42.934 --> 26:45.937
There you go.
She's not missing, she's just run off.

26:47.314 --> 26:50.775
She's flaky, but, uh...

26:51.651 --> 26:54.070
She didn't respond to my emergency texts.

26:54.154 --> 26:57.824
I was like, "911, it's your daughter
and I need you."

26:59.826 --> 27:01.745
Yeah. Time flies when you're...

27:02.954 --> 27:03.955
you know, her.

27:07.125 --> 27:07.959
Yeah.

27:08.585 --> 27:10.378
I've got to get to work,

27:10.462 --> 27:13.840
but I do really appreciate this,
thank you.

27:13.923 --> 27:14.758
You bet.

27:25.935 --> 27:28.188
Stop hogging the bleach, bitch.

27:28.271 --> 27:29.648
That's my bleach. I bought it.

27:29.731 --> 27:31.191
Oh, yeah?

27:31.274 --> 27:36.780
'Cause I see the word "Kelly" on here.

27:38.073 --> 27:40.158
-Okay.
-Mind if I put on some music?

27:40.241 --> 27:43.620
She's got a decent sound system
I'm gonna steal.

27:43.703 --> 27:44.537
Go for it.

28:31.292 --> 28:32.377
Kelly!

28:33.545 --> 28:36.798
Hey, Kelly,
I think I saw something outside.

29:50.872 --> 29:52.123
Is anyone out here?

29:53.041 --> 29:54.417
Alex!

29:56.044 --> 29:56.961
Alex!

29:57.921 --> 29:58.963
Up here.

30:00.131 --> 30:02.050
Look. I found more locks.

30:02.133 --> 30:04.636
This lady was into locks.

30:06.846 --> 30:07.806
Does it open?

30:07.889 --> 30:09.057
It's stuck.

30:11.810 --> 30:13.186
Maybe we can force it.

30:19.818 --> 30:21.569
I think the wood's swollen.

30:58.106 --> 31:00.483
-Should we check it out?
-Hell no.

31:00.567 --> 31:02.902
I ain't crawling up this house's ass.

31:08.491 --> 31:09.742
Give me your lighter.

31:37.520 --> 31:39.522
She must have locked him in here.

31:59.918 --> 32:00.793
Kelly?

32:02.003 --> 32:03.171
Hey, Kelly!

32:04.088 --> 32:06.591
Kelly, open the door! This isn't funny!

32:11.679 --> 32:12.931
Alex!

32:16.017 --> 32:17.101
Alex!

32:20.855 --> 32:21.981
Alex!

32:22.649 --> 32:25.193
Sorry, door slammed closed,
I couldn't get it open again.

32:28.571 --> 32:29.781
Breathe.

32:35.078 --> 32:36.162
Breathe.

32:38.414 --> 32:39.707
You're okay.

32:40.833 --> 32:42.377
I'll get some water.

32:45.922 --> 32:48.675
I'm sorry. Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

33:01.813 --> 33:05.233
Panic attacks are the worst.
I get one every time I go to Old Navy.

33:05.316 --> 33:06.985
All those fucking cargo shorts.

33:13.825 --> 33:16.035
-I need to find my mom.
-What?

33:16.119 --> 33:20.081
Yeah, I think something's happened to her.
I need to go find my mom.

33:30.633 --> 33:31.634
Mom!

33:57.076 --> 33:59.120
Good day, this is Basil Desmond.

33:59.203 --> 34:01.289
Leave me info at the tone. Cheers, mate.

34:02.040 --> 34:04.542
At the tone,
please record your message.

34:05.626 --> 34:07.128
Hey, what's up, Basil Desmond,

34:07.211 --> 34:09.464
I'm curious as to why
you think you have the right

34:09.547 --> 34:11.799
to rent my mother's house out, mate.

34:11.883 --> 34:14.761
Also, where the fuck is she?
Please tell her to call me.

34:14.844 --> 34:16.721
Hey, Sue, have you seen my mom?

34:16.804 --> 34:20.224
She's teaching Tuesday ceramics,
but Anna covered for her this time.

34:21.350 --> 34:22.977
Okay. Thank you.

34:26.481 --> 34:28.149
Hey, has Paula Langley been in?

34:28.232 --> 34:29.817
-No.
-Thanks.

34:33.988 --> 34:37.158
-Hey, has Paula Langley been in here?
-Mm-mm.

34:37.784 --> 34:38.743
Thanks.

34:41.496 --> 34:43.790
Hey, has Paula Langley been in here?

34:43.873 --> 34:45.833
Has Paula Langley been in here?

34:56.594 --> 34:57.512
Danielle?

34:58.971 --> 35:00.598
Danielle! Oh, my God.

35:00.681 --> 35:01.766
-Hi.
-Hi.

35:01.849 --> 35:03.226
Hi. It's really you!

35:03.893 --> 35:05.144
Oh, my God!

35:05.228 --> 35:06.187
-Hi.
-Hi.

35:06.270 --> 35:09.065
I've been so worried since
you left the shelter. Are you okay?

35:09.148 --> 35:10.066
Is Max okay?

35:10.149 --> 35:12.860
We're fine. Are you okay?
You look like dog shit.

35:12.944 --> 35:16.614
Oh, no, I'm terrible,
I'm going insane, I'm losing my mind.

35:16.697 --> 35:20.660
Yeah, Maddy's sick and
I can't find my mom anywhere,

35:20.743 --> 35:23.704
and I have mold and I'm bunking
with the twins from The Shining.

35:23.788 --> 35:25.414
There's a lot to unpack there.

35:27.250 --> 35:28.709
It's so good to see you.

35:30.503 --> 35:32.338
Why didn't you leave me your number?

35:33.673 --> 35:35.049
Yeah, yeah. Totally.

35:35.133 --> 35:36.134
Um...

35:36.217 --> 35:38.886
That's cool, man.
Yeah. Just walking in now.

35:38.970 --> 35:42.014
Sorry. You must have me
confused with someone else.

35:42.098 --> 35:43.599
Hey, we're gonna be late.

35:47.478 --> 35:49.272
-Is she a friend of yours?
-No.

36:01.576 --> 36:02.577
What's going on?

36:02.660 --> 36:05.246
I saw Danielle in the street
with her husband.

36:05.329 --> 36:06.581
Oh.

36:06.664 --> 36:09.417
-I need her phone number.
-I can't give that to you.

36:11.002 --> 36:13.171
She's not okay. Denise.

36:13.254 --> 36:16.591
She pretended not to know me.
I saw it, how afraid of him she was.

36:16.674 --> 36:18.426
I have to do something.

36:19.010 --> 36:21.554
I know how you feel.
And I want to call her too.

36:21.637 --> 36:23.931
-But we can't.
-Why the fuck not?

36:24.682 --> 36:27.310
I know that you have her number,
so give it to me!

36:27.393 --> 36:32.773
Hey! Don't you come at me, girl.
We both know I can't give you shit.

36:48.497 --> 36:50.458
It was so sad seeing her.

36:52.126 --> 36:53.169
It is sad.

36:53.711 --> 36:55.671
But all we can do
is send her love and light

36:55.755 --> 36:58.507
and hope she finds her way
back here someday.

36:59.008 --> 37:02.970
Maybe seeing you today
reminded her who she is.

37:04.138 --> 37:05.640
Maybe you did help her.

37:09.644 --> 37:10.519
I don't understand.

37:10.603 --> 37:13.397
How can she stay with somebody
that is abusing her? She knows.

37:13.481 --> 37:18.903
Well, Danielle might be lying
to herself in order to survive.

37:19.946 --> 37:21.864
Who knows what she's up against.

37:22.365 --> 37:26.619
She might be trying to break a cycle
of abuse going on for generations.

37:27.245 --> 37:31.791
We talk about this in group therapy.
Which you've not been coming to.

37:34.335 --> 37:37.338
Maddy's been sick. Too sick for me
to do much of anything.

37:37.421 --> 37:38.339
Mm.

37:39.257 --> 37:40.841
I do need therapy, though.

37:42.802 --> 37:45.304
I keep on having these dreams
that I am, uh...

37:45.930 --> 37:46.847
Barefoot Billy.

37:47.431 --> 37:48.641
The kid burglar?

37:50.559 --> 37:52.603
Yeah. Yep.

37:53.229 --> 37:57.984
I've been cleaning his house,
and the stuff I've seen there is freaky.

37:59.110 --> 38:00.569
What have you seen?

38:00.653 --> 38:03.406
There's a crawl space

38:04.031 --> 38:06.951
that his mom used to lock him in.

38:07.785 --> 38:11.163
That I was stupid enough
to go inside and...

38:11.914 --> 38:13.833
I had an actual panic attack.

38:13.916 --> 38:19.171
Panic attacks can be the body's way
of telling you it knows something.

38:21.757 --> 38:24.844
I think I just need
a good night's sleep and a healthy kid.

38:24.927 --> 38:26.220
I hear you.

38:29.015 --> 38:31.434
Hey, I'm sorry I was a bitch before.

38:32.518 --> 38:33.769
It's okay, baby girl.

38:34.603 --> 38:36.439
Makes me like you even more.

38:38.899 --> 38:41.694
Someone usually brings donuts
to group therapy.

38:42.320 --> 38:43.446
I'm just saying.

39:10.014 --> 39:13.768
Mommy's here. She's here.
She's here. Come on.

39:22.193 --> 39:23.402
Here she is, see.

39:23.486 --> 39:24.820
Hey, shoop-a-roo.

39:25.571 --> 39:27.198
-Who do we have here?
-Bob!

39:27.281 --> 39:29.575
That's Bob. Hope you don't mind.

39:29.658 --> 39:32.119
-Did you thank Grandpa for Bob?
-She did.

39:32.203 --> 39:34.038
-You did?
-Yes.

39:34.121 --> 39:36.791
I'm sorry that I'm later
than I said I'd be.

39:36.874 --> 39:37.917
No, no problem.

40:11.575 --> 40:13.077
Alex!

40:13.786 --> 40:14.787
Alex!

41:03.461 --> 41:04.879
Your bed not comfortable?

41:05.463 --> 41:07.089
Just getting some water.

41:07.715 --> 41:09.675
And a snack.

41:10.509 --> 41:12.928
Go ahead. Help yourself
to anything you want in there.

41:13.012 --> 41:13.971
Don't be shy.

41:14.930 --> 41:16.599
Grab me the peanut butter, will you?

41:21.729 --> 41:23.439
Still eat it out of the jar?

41:24.815 --> 41:26.901
What, am I supposed to put it in a dish?

41:32.531 --> 41:34.116
Can I ask you a question?

41:36.076 --> 41:37.161
Shoot.

41:38.496 --> 41:40.498
Did I use to hide in that cupboard?

41:42.583 --> 41:43.876
What cupboard?

41:45.169 --> 41:46.420
That one.

41:48.839 --> 41:49.924
Uh...

41:50.007 --> 41:53.093
No, you couldn't have,
because I put those in when we renovated.

41:53.177 --> 41:54.845
After the twins were born.

41:58.349 --> 42:00.726
Was there a cupboard there before that?

42:04.271 --> 42:05.272
No.

42:16.283 --> 42:18.744
-Can I ask you another question?
-Mm-hm.

42:20.496 --> 42:21.789
When Mom left...

42:22.665 --> 42:24.708
why didn't I stay here with you?

42:28.546 --> 42:30.923
I didn't have much choice in the matter.

42:32.007 --> 42:34.301
She split with you
in the middle of the night.

42:36.136 --> 42:37.763
Did you try to get me back?

42:41.016 --> 42:43.561
I was afraid of your mother back then.

42:46.397 --> 42:50.025
She'd have these sudden mood swings...

42:51.110 --> 42:54.905
and I was really young, and she was just
a lot more than I could handle.

43:02.204 --> 43:03.622
Did you worry about me?

43:06.750 --> 43:09.628
Off in a sketchy commune
with Mom in Alaska?

43:12.673 --> 43:15.050
Yeah. I did.

43:19.555 --> 43:21.432
I should have done something about that.

43:23.267 --> 43:24.101
But...

43:26.854 --> 43:29.106
I think I have awesome grandpa potential.

43:31.567 --> 43:34.153
If you'll let me get it right with Maddy.

43:43.746 --> 43:47.499
You were right. It's in the walls.
Black mold. Floor to ceiling.

43:47.583 --> 43:51.003
We're going to take all this out.
Go down to the studs.

43:51.795 --> 43:52.963
Replace it all.

43:53.047 --> 43:53.964
Okay.

43:55.633 --> 43:57.051
So how long is that gonna take?

44:00.054 --> 44:01.221
Weeks?

44:01.305 --> 44:02.848
Or months, or...?

44:02.931 --> 44:06.185
At least. Gotta go to County, get permits.

44:06.268 --> 44:08.145
You've gotta get all your stuff out.

44:10.439 --> 44:12.483
Is there another unit
open in this building?

44:16.904 --> 44:17.905
So...?

44:19.239 --> 44:20.783
Where do I live now, uh...?

44:22.868 --> 44:23.702
Nowhere.

44:24.453 --> 44:27.414
Ask your case worker. Sorry, mama.

44:28.040 --> 44:29.500
You gotta move out.

44:39.468 --> 44:40.678
Are you sure?

44:40.761 --> 44:41.720
Yeah, of course.

44:41.804 --> 44:44.890
I'll take my truck over this weekend
and get the rest of your stuff.

44:45.391 --> 44:46.850
It's gonna be all right.

44:46.934 --> 44:48.227
Thank you, Dad.

44:50.396 --> 44:51.647
I'll see you after work.

44:52.231 --> 44:55.567
You guys did a decent job,
got rid of all that clutter.

44:55.651 --> 44:56.485
Yep.

45:03.617 --> 45:06.245
You took all the racks out
and scrubbed out the bottom?

45:06.328 --> 45:08.664
-Mm-hm.
-What's with the locks on the cabinets?

45:08.747 --> 45:11.750
Uh, figured we could just let
the Realtor deal with that.

45:11.834 --> 45:13.794
Mm. Not bad, ladies!

45:13.877 --> 45:16.547
All right, let's get
the Rug Doctor back in the van.

45:21.260 --> 45:22.428
Don't forget to lock up.

45:24.138 --> 45:25.055
Hey, I got it.

45:26.932 --> 45:27.975
Later, player.

46:21.779 --> 46:23.238
In case you're out here.

48:54.681 --> 48:57.851
I'm not doing this
again with you, I told you!

48:57.935 --> 49:00.312
-I'm leaving!
-No, shut the fuck up!

49:07.611 --> 49:08.695
Alex!

49:13.241 --> 49:14.159
Alex!

49:15.577 --> 49:18.038
It's okay, baby. Mommy's okay.

49:19.456 --> 49:21.875
Okay, come on, sweetie. We've got to go.

49:34.096 --> 49:36.348
Hey, honey. Come here.

49:36.431 --> 49:37.849
Alex! Hi!

49:40.143 --> 49:41.937
Just-- I'm just making dinner.

49:44.606 --> 49:46.692
-Uh...
-Whoa, is everything okay?

49:46.775 --> 49:49.403
Yeah, we're actually
not gonna stay here after all.

49:49.486 --> 49:51.363
We're gonna go ahead and get out early.

49:51.446 --> 49:52.823
Did something happen?

49:53.699 --> 49:54.533
Come here.

49:56.868 --> 49:57.953
Can I...?

49:59.663 --> 50:01.415
Okay, bye, Maddy!

50:01.498 --> 50:02.541
What's going on?

50:02.624 --> 50:06.128
They have to leave all of a sudden.
Do you at least want to stay for dinner?

50:06.211 --> 50:07.045
Oh, no, thank you.

50:07.129 --> 50:09.339
Uh, Alex, where are you going?

50:11.591 --> 50:14.094
You're upset. Do you think
you should be driving?

50:14.177 --> 50:17.347
Yep. Maddy, say goodbye
to your grandpa, okay?

50:18.682 --> 50:20.475
Can I at least give Maddy a hug?

50:20.559 --> 50:22.769
Don't you fucking touch her!

50:23.270 --> 50:24.604
I was hiding from you.

50:24.688 --> 50:27.315
There was a cupboard,
and I was hiding from you!

50:28.817 --> 50:31.862
We didn't go to Alaska because Mom
was chasing after some boyfriend,

50:31.945 --> 50:34.114
we went there to run away from you.

50:37.951 --> 50:39.036
Alex...

50:46.835 --> 50:49.421
Where are we going, Mommy?

50:51.465 --> 50:52.507
I don't know.

50:52.591 --> 50:56.303
Why don't we try to break into Grammy's
and have a fun campout?

50:57.137 --> 50:59.765
When's home, Mommy?

51:00.807 --> 51:03.977
-I want home.
-I know you do.

51:04.478 --> 51:05.562
I want home too.

51:43.266 --> 51:44.309
Hello?

51:48.897 --> 51:49.898
Alex!

51:49.981 --> 51:54.903
Christ, oh, my God. Mom.
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

51:54.986 --> 51:55.987
Okay.

51:56.738 --> 51:58.073
Where have you been?

51:58.156 --> 52:00.700
Joshua Tree. I just got back.

52:00.784 --> 52:04.204
Trying to get the generator on.
Basil's gone to get groceries.

52:04.287 --> 52:07.457
Hey, girl. Where did you get
that super cute car?

52:09.084 --> 52:12.045
-I thought you were dead, Mom.
-Me? Why?

52:13.713 --> 52:15.215
Why don't you answer your phone?

52:15.298 --> 52:17.634
Oh, that.

52:17.717 --> 52:20.554
Well, I left it in Reno somewhere.

52:20.637 --> 52:27.018
I got over-served, but, baby, we met
this adorable gay couple from Sedona

52:27.102 --> 52:28.520
on their way to Joshua Tree

52:28.603 --> 52:32.023
and they invited us along,
and we listened to U2 the whole way.

52:36.403 --> 52:38.029
-Mom.
-Okay.

52:38.113 --> 52:40.073
God, I was so worried about you.

52:42.242 --> 52:43.660
Are you drunk?

52:45.162 --> 52:46.538
Are you drunk?

52:46.621 --> 52:49.374
No, I was about to try
to break in here, though.

52:49.457 --> 52:52.252
I have Maddy and we need
some place to crash.

52:53.128 --> 52:57.048
Baby. Well, you know
you can always crash with me.

52:57.132 --> 52:59.718
Come on. Hey!

52:59.801 --> 53:01.887
Let me get the flashlight!

53:02.721 --> 53:04.347
We'll get the power on!

53:06.141 --> 53:10.187
I have something to tell you, Alex.

53:11.354 --> 53:13.064
-Okay. Uh...

53:14.191 --> 53:17.736
Yeah. I actually have something
I have to tell you too.

53:19.070 --> 53:20.238
I, um...

53:21.573 --> 53:23.575
I spent the last couple
of nights at Dad's.

53:23.658 --> 53:27.120
Oh, shit, man,
you must need a stiff drink!

53:27.204 --> 53:29.206
Oh, God.

53:29.289 --> 53:32.584
Hey, why didn't you
ever tell me that he hit you?

53:34.211 --> 53:35.962
Oh, damn, Alex.

53:36.046 --> 53:39.424
Why would you want to bring up
that dark shit, huh?

53:42.928 --> 53:44.471
Did he hit you a lot?

53:47.432 --> 53:48.391
I don't know.

53:49.559 --> 53:52.187
I don't think about that stuff, you know?

53:52.270 --> 53:55.357
I think about forward motion!

53:55.440 --> 54:00.070
I think about how I am a creator!

54:00.153 --> 54:01.571
A healer.

54:02.280 --> 54:04.616
A teacher.

54:04.699 --> 54:06.201
A lover.

54:06.284 --> 54:08.203
And, as of yesterday...

54:11.248 --> 54:13.291
a wife!

54:13.375 --> 54:15.669
Look at that. Put a ring on it, baby.

54:18.129 --> 54:18.964
What?

54:19.047 --> 54:21.299
We decided in Joshua Tree.

54:21.383 --> 54:25.804
Oh, baby, we went on this fucking hike,
and I forgot to bring any water.

54:25.887 --> 54:28.306
And the only shade that we could find

54:28.390 --> 54:34.271
was underneath these two, entangled,
500-year-old Joshua trees

54:34.354 --> 54:39.901
that were just growing together,
you know, reaching for each other.

54:40.694 --> 54:45.407
And, baby, I started to cry.

54:46.658 --> 54:49.869
I want to take root
with someone like that.

54:49.953 --> 54:53.581
And so does he. So...

54:55.750 --> 54:58.044
we stopped in Reno!

54:58.503 --> 55:00.880
Like a couple of kids!

55:00.964 --> 55:03.216
Howled at the moon!

55:05.468 --> 55:06.594
Yeah.

55:14.602 --> 55:16.563
See? There.

55:19.566 --> 55:21.151
I don't know what to say.

55:22.902 --> 55:24.612
What do you say?

55:24.696 --> 55:29.784
"Congratulations, Mama,
you found happiness and you deserve it."

55:30.327 --> 55:31.953
Congratulations, Mom.

55:33.955 --> 55:35.081
Yeah.

55:35.165 --> 55:37.375
Yay, yay! Tequila!

55:37.459 --> 55:41.212
Oh, hey. Hey. Maddy's sleeping,
so can we do quiet tequila?

55:41.838 --> 55:42.922
Quiet tequila.

55:45.300 --> 55:46.301
Yeah.
