WEBVTT

00:03.937 --> 00:06.260
And that's the thing,
hindsight's always 20/20.

00:06.261 --> 00:07.007
Yeah.

00:07.008 --> 00:08.290
You can't put yourself out
there like that.

00:08.333 --> 00:09.900
You just... you can't.
It's too dangerous.

00:09.943 --> 00:11.380
Dad, please.

00:13.208 --> 00:15.863
Thank you.

00:15.906 --> 00:18.256
An opinion is formed
in the first seven seconds

00:18.300 --> 00:19.910
of meeting or seeing someone.

00:19.954 --> 00:23.044
You really want a picture
of you making a duckface

00:23.087 --> 00:25.916
in a bikini to be what
that opinion is based on?

00:25.960 --> 00:28.005
First thing colleges do is check

00:28.049 --> 00:29.137
an applicant's social media.

00:29.180 --> 00:30.486
Mm.

00:30.529 --> 00:32.792
One dumb post can change
the course of your life

00:32.836 --> 00:35.578
or your chances of getting
into Harvard.

00:37.710 --> 00:41.236
You're right.
I'm sorry.

00:41.279 --> 00:43.934
But it's getting late,
so I should probably go study

00:43.978 --> 00:47.764
and take down
the duckface photo.

00:47.807 --> 00:49.374
I think that's a fantastic idea.

00:49.418 --> 00:51.289
Mm, mm-hmm.

00:51.333 --> 00:53.378
Let me get the check.
I'll drive you home.

00:53.422 --> 00:54.727
No, you're going
the opposite way.

00:54.771 --> 00:55.728
I'll just... I'll get a cab.

00:55.772 --> 00:57.078
No, I'll drive you.

00:57.121 --> 01:00.733
Oh, you're being ridiculous.
I am almost 18.

01:00.777 --> 01:02.779
When did that happen?

01:02.822 --> 01:04.433
Okay, fine.

01:04.476 --> 01:07.001
- I love you.
- I love you.

01:07.044 --> 01:09.133
Text me, so I know
you got home okay.

01:11.000 --> 01:17.074

02:31.563 --> 02:33.130
Let's take your statement
outside, please.

02:33.174 --> 02:34.566
I'm waiting for
some other agents to come in.

02:34.610 --> 02:36.046
They'd like to speak with you
as well.

02:36.090 --> 02:39.658
Just gotta hear it again.
Okay, I understand that.

02:39.702 --> 02:40.964
What have we got?

02:41.008 --> 02:43.184
Female, 17,
abducted about four hours ago.

02:43.227 --> 02:45.621
This is Ms. Bates.
She saw the abduction.

02:45.664 --> 02:46.883
Four hours ago?

02:46.926 --> 02:48.493
That's on them, not me.

02:48.537 --> 02:51.279
I called 911 the second
I saw the girl got grabbed.

02:51.322 --> 02:53.455
It was 9:33 p.m.

02:53.498 --> 02:55.500
It took 'em 40 minutes
before they responded.

02:55.544 --> 02:59.374
PD says she's a frequent caller.

02:59.417 --> 03:01.115
What did you see exactly?

03:01.158 --> 03:03.247
Guy with a ski mask
and white tennis shoes

03:03.291 --> 03:05.597
grabbed the girl before
she could scream.

03:05.641 --> 03:06.946
Then what happened?

03:06.990 --> 03:09.210
Grabbed my cell phone
so I could call the cops.

03:09.253 --> 03:10.428
Did you see a car?

03:10.472 --> 03:12.126
All I saw after I got off
the phone

03:12.169 --> 03:15.346
was her purse laying there.

03:15.390 --> 03:16.826
Okay, keep canvassing the area,

03:16.869 --> 03:18.219
see if anyone else witnessed
what went down.

03:18.262 --> 03:21.178
I'm on it.
Ma'am, come with me, please.

03:21.222 --> 03:23.180
First 24 hours are
the most important.

03:23.224 --> 03:25.574
We've already been
robbed of four.

03:34.757 --> 03:36.585
She's just a kid.

03:39.414 --> 03:41.546
Kidnapped victim is
Elizabeth Chase.

03:41.590 --> 03:43.896
She's 17 years old,
a senior at the Wheeler School.

03:43.940 --> 03:46.160
Her parents are going through
a divorce.

03:46.203 --> 03:49.989
Social media indicates
she's a driven over-achiever,

03:50.033 --> 03:51.339
not much personal posting,

03:51.382 --> 03:54.472
mostly résumé,
college application stuff.

03:54.516 --> 03:55.952
This girl's all about
her future.

03:55.995 --> 03:57.997
Yeah, let's make sure
she still has one.

03:58.041 --> 04:00.565
Anything from CCTV footage
near the restaurant?

04:00.609 --> 04:02.350
No, and we came up dry

04:02.393 --> 04:04.352
canvassing the neighborhood
for additional witnesses.

04:04.395 --> 04:05.875
Okay.

04:05.918 --> 04:08.443
You said the parents
were split, not divorced?

04:08.486 --> 04:10.445
Not yet, but according
to court documents,

04:10.488 --> 04:13.274
it's an ugly situation.

04:13.317 --> 04:15.450
Can you give me a financial
and professional snapshot

04:15.493 --> 04:16.755
of both parents?

04:16.798 --> 04:19.802
Father, Benjamin Chase,
own several of those

04:19.845 --> 04:21.369
online print magazines.

04:21.411 --> 04:22.718
You know, the kind that
specialize in

04:22.761 --> 04:24.023
exploiting celebrity lives.

04:24.067 --> 04:25.547
And the mom?

04:25.590 --> 04:29.246
Social, soccer mom, old money,

04:29.290 --> 04:31.727
combined net worth of
approximately $50 million.

04:31.770 --> 04:33.729
Well, working class rich
by New York standards,

04:33.772 --> 04:36.775
but certainly wealthy enough
for a ransom demand.

04:36.819 --> 04:39.996
Unless, of course,
this was a sexual abduction.

04:44.653 --> 04:45.741
Hey.

04:45.784 --> 04:46.872
We've been on scene
for about an hour,

04:46.916 --> 04:48.439
place is filling up fast.

04:48.483 --> 04:49.875
"Filling up"?

04:49.919 --> 04:51.660
One of the family members
put the abduction

04:51.703 --> 04:52.748
out on social media.

04:52.791 --> 04:53.966
What?

04:54.010 --> 04:55.490
Sign of the times, I mean,

04:55.533 --> 04:57.361
why make two dozen calls when
a single post suffices?

04:57.405 --> 04:58.667
Well, there's
a big difference between

04:58.710 --> 05:00.016
sharing a picture of your latte

05:00.059 --> 05:01.278
and announcing
your daughter's abduction.

05:01.322 --> 05:03.846
Well, apparently not
to these people.

05:13.638 --> 05:15.814
Mrs. Chase,
I'm Special Agent Bell.

05:15.858 --> 05:17.381
This is Special Agent Zidan.

05:17.425 --> 05:19.644
We're gonna be taking point on
the search for your daughter.

05:19.688 --> 05:21.080
Is there any news?

05:21.124 --> 05:23.735
No, not yet, but we are doing
everything we can

05:23.779 --> 05:24.910
to bring Elizabeth home.

05:24.954 --> 05:26.216
We promise.

05:27.826 --> 05:30.612
Someone said her purse
was found near the restaurant,

05:30.655 --> 05:32.004
is that true?

05:32.048 --> 05:33.005
Yes.

05:33.049 --> 05:34.268
Was her inhaler inside?

05:36.139 --> 05:37.836
How bad is her asthma?

05:37.880 --> 05:40.056
She uses it
three to four times a day.

05:40.099 --> 05:43.190
She could die without it.

05:48.195 --> 05:50.240
I know that this is
very difficult,

05:50.284 --> 05:52.808
but we need to ask you
some questions.

05:52.851 --> 05:57.508
Anything, whatever helps
bring my little girl home safe.

05:57.552 --> 06:00.032
Has anybody made
any financial demands

06:00.076 --> 06:03.949
or asked you of a favor,
you or your husband?

06:03.993 --> 06:06.213
We're talking before
Elizabeth was taken.

06:07.736 --> 06:09.172
No.

06:09.216 --> 06:10.826
Is there anybody that
you know that

06:10.869 --> 06:12.262
might wanna harm your daughter?

06:15.047 --> 06:17.224
Elizabeth gets along
with everyone.

06:17.267 --> 06:19.878
She's a really sweet,
good person.

06:22.794 --> 06:24.796
But my husband,
he has lots of enemies.

06:24.840 --> 06:26.407
Why do you say that?

06:26.450 --> 06:28.800
Because it's true.

06:28.844 --> 06:33.283
His job, the content he creates,

06:33.327 --> 06:35.851
it's all about
humiliating people.

06:35.894 --> 06:37.156
Is he here?

06:37.200 --> 06:39.246
No, at his office.

06:41.509 --> 06:44.773
Don't get me wrong,
he loves Elizabeth very much,

06:44.816 --> 06:47.036
and he's as freaked out as I am.

06:47.079 --> 06:51.606
It's just hard for us to be
near each other right now.

06:54.739 --> 06:56.872
Hello, I'm Benjamin Chase.
Close the door.

06:59.570 --> 07:01.703
I should have driven her home.

07:01.746 --> 07:03.444
I don't know what the hell
I was thinking.

07:03.487 --> 07:04.749
I try not to suffocate her.

07:04.793 --> 07:06.708
She's always asking for
more independence,

07:06.751 --> 07:07.709
more freedom...

07:07.752 --> 07:10.320
Mr. Chase,
this isn't your fault.

07:10.364 --> 07:14.759
I mean, she's 17, kids her age
ride the subway, take cabs.

07:17.762 --> 07:20.765
Your wife mentioned that
you have some enemies.

07:22.593 --> 07:24.247
Close that door.

07:26.597 --> 07:28.382
I don't need everyone knowing
my damn business.

07:28.425 --> 07:31.428
Yes, I have some enemies.
Who doesn't?

07:31.472 --> 07:33.822
A lot of people, actually.

07:33.865 --> 07:37.086
So we're interested in knowing
who yours are.

07:37.129 --> 07:39.654
Well, that's gonna take me
a few hours to put together.

07:39.697 --> 07:41.003
It's that long?

07:43.005 --> 07:44.615
Yes, sadly.

07:47.226 --> 07:50.969
We write a lot of articles,
post a lot of photos.

07:51.013 --> 07:54.756
Most of them...
are unflattering.

07:57.149 --> 07:59.804
Being kind and gentle doesn't
attract too many eyeballs.

08:01.850 --> 08:04.243
So you do what you gotta do.

08:04.287 --> 08:05.941
Well, since your list
is so long,

08:05.984 --> 08:07.334
I suggest you start working
on it.

08:07.377 --> 08:09.074
The faster, the better.

08:09.118 --> 08:10.946
Your daughter's life might
depend on it.

08:14.341 --> 08:15.864
Hey, any luck with that
list of possibles

08:15.907 --> 08:17.213
the father gave us?

08:17.256 --> 08:20.390
No, field agents have already
interviewed and ruled out most of them.

08:20.434 --> 08:23.611
Hey, you're applying
to be an agent?

08:23.654 --> 08:24.873
Yeah.

08:24.916 --> 08:27.266
Don't get me wrong,
I love being an analyst,

08:27.310 --> 08:30.487
but I wanna be out in
the field like Maggie and OA.

08:30.531 --> 08:32.967
And I can't do that
without a badge, so...

08:33.010 --> 08:34.621
All right.
All right.

08:34.664 --> 08:36.058
Well, have you told Dana yet?

08:37.712 --> 08:40.453
I mean, I sent her an email
about a possible

08:40.496 --> 08:44.196
letter of recommendation,
but she's not responded.

08:44.240 --> 08:45.676
You should just talk to her
about it in person.

08:45.720 --> 08:46.808
What's the worst she can say?

08:46.851 --> 08:48.549
That I'm not field agent
material.

08:49.898 --> 08:51.203
Well, you know, think
negatively about yourself,

08:51.247 --> 08:53.205
everyone else will do the same.

08:53.249 --> 08:55.120
You get that from
a self-help book?

08:55.164 --> 08:57.862
Yeah... no, it was
a fortune cookie, actually.

08:57.906 --> 08:59.386
Hmm.

09:01.823 --> 09:04.303
Victim's father just got
a ransom demand.

09:04.347 --> 09:06.523
Let's go, folks.

09:06.567 --> 09:08.873
Maggie and OA are with
the dad now.

09:08.917 --> 09:10.266
What do we have?

09:10.309 --> 09:12.224
A text came from a burner.

09:12.268 --> 09:14.618
There's no way to trace it
back to the owner in real time.

09:14.662 --> 09:17.882
Sending a text using a burner
was a smart move on his part.

09:17.926 --> 09:20.102
But asking us to make
a money drop in a place

09:20.145 --> 09:22.147
he knows that we can
easily surveil isn't.

09:22.191 --> 09:23.845
So something's not adding up.

09:23.888 --> 09:25.542
Maybe the girl's dead already,

09:25.586 --> 09:27.849
and this is meant to distract
us while he makes a run for it.

09:27.892 --> 09:30.199
Take the threat seriously
and see where it takes us.

09:30.242 --> 09:32.201
All right.

10:05.626 --> 10:07.454
Package is in the trash can.

10:07.497 --> 10:09.630
Okay, stay loose, everybody,
but keep in mind

10:09.673 --> 10:12.284
there's a million dollars
of Bureau's flash money

10:12.328 --> 10:13.764
in that backpack.

10:13.808 --> 10:16.550
Well, hopefully this guy
is both greedy and stupid.

10:20.423 --> 10:23.295
White male, mid-30s,
eye on the bag.

10:25.036 --> 10:26.429
He's got the bag.

10:26.473 --> 10:28.344
Suspect is eastbound,
heading towards the stairs.

10:40.965 --> 10:42.750
Are you guys seeing this?

10:42.793 --> 10:44.229
We are.

10:44.273 --> 10:46.014
Remember, we have a tracker
sewn into the backpack.

10:46.057 --> 10:47.842
Just stay loose,
let the technology do

10:47.885 --> 10:49.365
the heavy lifting.

10:49.408 --> 10:50.409
If there's a handoff,

10:50.453 --> 10:52.455
the priority
is to stay with the bag.

10:52.499 --> 10:54.675
Hopefully it'll lead us
back to Elizabeth.

11:04.685 --> 11:06.556
I got him, on the right.

11:20.048 --> 11:23.530
Looks like he's crossing FDR
towards the river.

11:26.184 --> 11:28.796
He's looking in the backpack.

11:40.155 --> 11:42.113
Hey, hey, hey!

11:42.157 --> 11:43.854
Happy New Year, y'all!

11:43.898 --> 11:45.987
Here, here, here.

11:46.030 --> 11:48.163
Our suspect's playing
Santa Claus out here,

11:48.206 --> 11:50.382
but he's handing out
all the cash to the homeless.

11:50.426 --> 11:52.776
Move in and get that damn money.

11:54.386 --> 11:56.258
Here, here.

11:59.217 --> 12:00.349
- FBI.
- FBI.

12:00.392 --> 12:01.393
Don't move.

12:01.437 --> 12:02.873
Everybody put your hands
in the air.

12:02.917 --> 12:04.919
- Hey, come on, hands up.
- Look, you're under arrest.

12:04.962 --> 12:07.008
Get everything you can,
all of it.

12:07.051 --> 12:09.184
How much money is in that bag?

12:09.227 --> 12:11.708
Is that the kidnapper of
Benjamin Chase's daughter?

12:11.752 --> 12:14.581
- How much was the ransom?
- How much is in the bag?

12:14.624 --> 12:16.060
What the hell is this?

12:19.150 --> 12:21.326
You thinking what I'm thinking?
Yeah.

12:21.370 --> 12:22.676
We interpreted wrong.

12:22.719 --> 12:24.199
Her father wouldn't do anything
to exploit

12:24.242 --> 12:25.504
his daughter's kidnapping,
right?

12:25.548 --> 12:27.637
"It's hard to attract
eyeballs these days,

12:27.681 --> 12:29.857
so you do what you gotta do."

12:37.439 --> 12:39.311
These clowns work for
Benjamin Chase?

12:39.354 --> 12:40.790
No, a competing site.

12:40.834 --> 12:42.096
Who tipped 'em off?

12:42.140 --> 12:43.576
No one, apparently they've
been tracking Chase

12:43.619 --> 12:45.447
since word got out about
his daughter's kidnapping,

12:45.491 --> 12:47.232
hoping to get a photo-op
like this.

12:48.885 --> 12:50.322
Thanks.

12:50.365 --> 12:51.845
I'm telling you the truth.

12:51.888 --> 12:54.065
I don't know anything about
any missing girl.

12:54.108 --> 12:55.805
Then how did you know about
the backpack?

12:55.849 --> 12:58.504
Some guy,
I never met him before.

12:58.547 --> 12:59.983
So, some guy you've never
seen before

13:00.027 --> 13:02.116
just comes up to you and says
there's cash in a backpack

13:02.160 --> 13:03.422
in the trash can?

13:03.465 --> 13:05.163
Well, he didn't
say there was cash inside.

13:05.206 --> 13:07.382
He just said to get it
and meet him.

13:07.426 --> 13:08.644
Describe him.

13:08.688 --> 13:11.517
Ugh, um...

13:11.560 --> 13:15.608
Short, baseball cap,
white or not.

13:15.651 --> 13:19.481
Maybe Puerto Rican,
I don't know.

13:19.525 --> 13:21.179
Where were you supposed
to meet this guy?

13:21.222 --> 13:23.572
On the corner of
Bowery and Grand,

13:23.616 --> 13:25.270
but he wasn't around, so...

13:25.313 --> 13:27.402
So you decided it was yours?

13:27.446 --> 13:31.885
The guy didn't show, so why not?

13:31.928 --> 13:34.714
Because it's stealing.

13:36.759 --> 13:39.153
So, the kidnapper makes
a money demand,

13:39.197 --> 13:41.329
has a homeless dude pick up
the backpack and the cash,

13:41.373 --> 13:42.765
and then what?

13:42.809 --> 13:44.202
Just disappears before
he gets to the meeting spot?

13:44.245 --> 13:46.204
Well, he's either a very
unsophisticated criminal,

13:46.247 --> 13:49.163
or he's toying with us.

13:49.207 --> 13:50.469
I'm going with the former.

13:50.512 --> 13:52.210
I mean, everything about
this abduction has been

13:52.253 --> 13:53.994
immature and reckless.

13:54.037 --> 13:55.735
Either way, we need to find
that girl fast

13:55.778 --> 13:57.171
and get her home safely.

13:57.215 --> 13:59.391
I may have found something.

13:59.434 --> 14:01.784
I've been scanning
subway CCTV footage

14:01.828 --> 14:04.613
moments before our homeless
friend made his move,

14:04.657 --> 14:05.919
and I found him talking to
someone that

14:05.962 --> 14:08.878
matches the description
he gave OA.

14:08.922 --> 14:10.576
Anyone know this guy?

14:15.624 --> 14:18.061
Sir, we just need
a signature here.

14:18.105 --> 14:19.976
- You have news?
- Yeah.

14:20.020 --> 14:21.239
Greg, you're under arrest
for the kidnapping

14:21.282 --> 14:22.240
of Elizabeth Chase.

14:22.283 --> 14:23.415
What?
No.

14:23.458 --> 14:24.416
- You son of a bitch!
- No, no, no... hey!

14:24.459 --> 14:25.591
I'll kill you!
Let me go of me!

14:25.634 --> 14:27.245
I'll kill you!

14:29.725 --> 14:32.163
Where is she, Greg?

14:35.078 --> 14:38.169
It's not a trick question, bro.
Where is Elizabeth?

14:38.212 --> 14:40.214
I have no idea.

14:40.258 --> 14:42.521
Bad call.

14:42.564 --> 14:44.131
Your only shot at seeing
the light of day

14:44.175 --> 14:47.874
is to come clean
and tell us what happened.

14:47.917 --> 14:50.920
I... I swear I have nothing
to do with the kidnapping.

14:50.964 --> 14:53.793
You're gonna have to do
better than that, man.

14:53.836 --> 14:56.535
You're gonna have to tell us
the truth.

14:56.578 --> 14:58.711
The truth is,
I hate Benjamin Chase.

15:00.887 --> 15:04.195
No, I loathe him.
He's an awful man.

15:04.238 --> 15:07.981
He's a selfish, controlling,
arrogant prick

15:08.024 --> 15:09.287
who deserves to suffer.

15:11.027 --> 15:15.162
Okay,
now we're getting somewhere.

15:15.206 --> 15:17.860
When I heard there was
no ransom demand,

15:17.904 --> 15:21.647
I saw an opportunity.

15:21.690 --> 15:24.127
So I sent one.

15:24.171 --> 15:26.695
But after I paid the guy
at the subway to grab the cash,

15:26.739 --> 15:30.133
I realized I was making
a huge mistake, so I bailed.

15:34.616 --> 15:37.880
But I didn't kidnap Elizabeth.

15:37.924 --> 15:39.882
I'm not a criminal.

15:42.233 --> 15:44.844
Three days ago he made me
drop off a urine sample

15:44.887 --> 15:47.542
at his doctor's office.

15:47.586 --> 15:50.153
- Who?
- Benjamin Chase.

15:50.197 --> 15:51.459
My boss.

15:51.503 --> 15:52.721
Then when I get back, he told me

15:52.765 --> 15:54.070
to cancel my plans for tomorrow,

15:54.114 --> 15:55.855
because I need to take
his daughter

15:55.898 --> 15:57.335
to some college fair.

15:57.378 --> 15:59.293
He literally wants me to
chaperone her

15:59.337 --> 16:01.774
to and from the event
like I'm a nanny,

16:01.817 --> 16:03.297
and I am not a nanny.

16:03.341 --> 16:06.169
I went to Vanderbilt,
graduated Magna Cum Laude.

16:06.213 --> 16:08.389
I am not a nanny.

16:08.433 --> 16:12.741
We understand that you are
overworked and undervalued,

16:12.785 --> 16:15.831
but what you did is not okay.

16:15.875 --> 16:18.791
You diverted our attention
from an investigation.

16:18.834 --> 16:21.315
You swallowed up precious time
and resources

16:21.359 --> 16:23.752
all because of what,
you're mad at your boss?

16:23.796 --> 16:26.799
Is that seriously what
you are telling us right now?

16:28.279 --> 16:31.282
Yeah.

16:38.071 --> 16:39.464
What are you thinking?

16:39.507 --> 16:41.466
I think this freaked out kid
needs to get a new job

16:41.509 --> 16:42.597
and some sleep.

16:42.641 --> 16:44.469
Saying you wanna release him?

16:44.512 --> 16:46.949
I'm saying I don't think that
locking up Mr. Vanderbilt

16:46.993 --> 16:49.082
is gonna help us find
Elizabeth Chase.

16:49.125 --> 16:51.171
Kristen, please tell us
you have something.

16:51.214 --> 16:52.303
I might.

16:52.346 --> 16:53.478
When the case first dropped,
I notified

16:53.521 --> 16:55.349
all local hospitals
and pharmacies to be

16:55.393 --> 16:56.785
on the lookout for somebody
trying to purchase

16:56.829 --> 16:59.005
an inhaler or nebulizer
without an prescription.

16:59.048 --> 17:00.876
- Mm-hmm.
- Turns out, we just got a hit.

17:00.920 --> 17:03.488
Two hours ago,
a kid just jumped a counter

17:03.531 --> 17:05.881
at a local pharmacy
and ran off with an inhaler.

17:05.925 --> 17:07.405
Do we have a lead on this kid?

17:07.448 --> 17:08.928
Oh, the owner said
he was wearing a hoodie

17:08.971 --> 17:10.407
the whole time, so he couldn't
get a good look at his face.

17:10.451 --> 17:12.845
But he did flee west
after leaving the building.

17:12.887 --> 17:15.194
Okay, stay on it.

17:15.238 --> 17:17.196
Thanks, good job.

17:19.503 --> 17:21.243
Accessed security cameras
from a bank

17:21.288 --> 17:23.116
about a half a block west
of the pharmacy.

17:23.159 --> 17:25.031
Hopefully we can get
a better look at him.

17:25.074 --> 17:26.641
Good enough to run him
through facial rec?

17:26.685 --> 17:29.383
It's a 1080P HD camera setup.

17:29.427 --> 17:31.080
Okay, that's a good thing, then?

17:31.124 --> 17:33.953
It means a 1920 by 1080
pixel resolution.

17:33.996 --> 17:35.607
Maybe I need to rephrase
the question.

17:35.650 --> 17:39.262
If the kid shows up on camera,
am I gonna be happy?

17:39.306 --> 17:40.481
You'll be ecstatic.

17:40.525 --> 17:42.527
Good.

17:42.570 --> 17:44.398
Dana respond to your email yet?

17:44.442 --> 17:47.140
- No.
- Did you talk to her yet?

17:47.183 --> 17:48.663
- I...
- I got it.

17:48.707 --> 17:51.318
Take a look at this.
Okay.

17:55.409 --> 17:56.802
A kid that young won't be in

17:56.845 --> 17:58.107
the facial rec. Database,
right?

17:58.151 --> 18:00.196
No, but can I try something?

18:00.240 --> 18:02.242
Uh...

18:18.737 --> 18:20.826
How did you do that?

18:20.869 --> 18:22.828
Ah, well,
social media facial recognition

18:22.871 --> 18:24.699
is almost as good
as the Bureau's.

18:24.743 --> 18:28.137
So, it looks like this
kid's name is Charlie Jacobs.

18:28.181 --> 18:32.446
He's a junior at Sherwood.
Elizabeth goes to Wheeler, no?

18:32.490 --> 18:34.056
That doesn't mean they don't
know each other.

18:34.100 --> 18:36.972
OA, we have a suspect.
His name is Charlie Jacobs.

18:37.016 --> 18:39.671
There he is.

18:42.456 --> 18:43.544
Charlie Jacobs?

18:49.550 --> 18:52.684
Stop!
Charlie!

18:54.990 --> 18:57.123
Whoa!

18:57.166 --> 18:58.690
Oh, my...

18:58.733 --> 18:59.995
Hey, look at that dude!

19:00.039 --> 19:01.388
Move, move!

19:17.056 --> 19:19.058
Charlie!

19:20.233 --> 19:21.713
Charlie.

19:24.063 --> 19:25.368
There's nowhere else to go.

19:25.412 --> 19:27.240
All we wanna do is talk to you.

19:27.283 --> 19:28.284
Talk about what?

19:28.328 --> 19:31.940
Elizabeth Chase, where is she?

19:31.984 --> 19:33.159
She ruined everything.

19:33.202 --> 19:34.465
- What are you... wait.
- Hey.

19:34.508 --> 19:37.511
No, no, no, Charlie.
Come on, come back down.

19:37.555 --> 19:38.556
Okay?
Come over here.

19:38.599 --> 19:40.993
You didn't do anything wrong.

19:41.036 --> 19:43.778
Come on, come back down here.
Get off the ledge.

19:45.345 --> 19:48.043
Just let us help you,
Charlie, please.

19:50.089 --> 19:53.135
You're not in trouble.
You didn't do anything wrong.

19:53.179 --> 19:55.007
We just wanna talk.

20:03.494 --> 20:06.235
You don't wanna do this, man.

20:06.279 --> 20:08.455
I just...

20:08.499 --> 20:10.501
I just wanted to be famous.

20:33.633 --> 20:35.200
I didn't think he would jump.

20:37.376 --> 20:39.291
If I did, I would have...

20:39.334 --> 20:42.207
Yeah, me neither.

20:42.250 --> 20:45.862
"Elizabeth ruined everything."
What does that mean?

20:48.169 --> 20:52.956
I don't know, but he must
have wanted to keep her alive.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.916
If not, why steal from
the pharmacy?

20:55.959 --> 20:57.396
Could I have some gloves,
please?

20:57.439 --> 20:58.701
Thank you.

21:08.668 --> 21:10.974
There's no inhaler.

21:14.065 --> 21:17.111
There's no cash...

21:17.155 --> 21:19.548
and his dad's credit card.

21:19.592 --> 21:22.203
Okay, let's see where that
was last used.

21:22.247 --> 21:23.944
What do we know about
Charlie Jacobs?

21:23.987 --> 21:25.946
How is he connected to
our victim, Elizabeth Chase?

21:25.989 --> 21:27.774
Were they friends?
Were they classmates?

21:27.817 --> 21:29.384
As far as I can tell, neither.

21:29.428 --> 21:30.994
There's gotta be a nexus,
so let's find it.

21:31.038 --> 21:32.344
Unlike the Rolling Stones song,

21:32.387 --> 21:35.390
time is not on our side,
people, so let's move.

21:35.434 --> 21:37.000
What else do you got on
young Mr. Jacobs?

21:37.044 --> 21:39.350
I called the head of school at Sherwood...
Mm-hmm.

21:39.351 --> 21:42.310
Word is Charlie was more of
a troubled loner type;

21:42.354 --> 21:44.704
Didn't like his school,
his teacher, his classmates.

21:44.747 --> 21:46.749
- What about social media?
- Confirms that assessment.

21:46.793 --> 21:49.230
All his posts are pretty much
rants against

21:49.274 --> 21:51.493
the privileged private school
establishment.

21:51.537 --> 21:53.365
Look at this.

21:53.408 --> 21:56.150
"Saw some rich whore
in Yeezy's in Montclair

21:56.194 --> 21:57.630
"making out with jock BF.

21:57.673 --> 21:59.675
Felt urge to slaughter."

21:59.719 --> 22:01.503
So, Charlie was opinionated.

22:01.547 --> 22:03.244
He probably thought
all that hate would bring him

22:03.288 --> 22:05.333
some measure of attention
and approval.

22:05.377 --> 22:07.379
Well, if that was his jam,
it didn't work.

22:07.422 --> 22:09.555
No followers, hardly any likes.

22:09.598 --> 22:11.774
Mm.

22:11.818 --> 22:13.472
What about this
kid's cell phone?

22:13.515 --> 22:14.777
He wiped all his text messages,

22:14.821 --> 22:16.301
but we are working on
recovering them.

22:16.344 --> 22:17.911
Another thing of notice,
he did not have

22:17.954 --> 22:19.173
the stolen inhaler on him.

22:19.217 --> 22:20.846
Which means
he dropped it somewhere

22:20.847 --> 22:21.997
before you went to see him.

22:21.998 --> 22:24.091
- Right.
- Kristen, focus on that.

22:24.135 --> 22:26.518
The Judge just John Hancocked the
search warrant for Charlie's house.

22:26.519 --> 22:28.922
Great, let's get Maggie
and OA over there right away.

22:28.965 --> 22:30.228
Yep.

22:30.271 --> 22:32.055
My son might have been
a little different,

22:32.099 --> 22:35.711
but he wouldn't harm anyone.

22:36.930 --> 22:40.107
We're not saying that he did.

22:40.151 --> 22:43.154
Do you know who this girl is?

22:43.197 --> 22:46.505
No.
I've never seen her before.

22:54.208 --> 22:55.253
Hey.

22:55.296 --> 22:57.690
He has 600 milligrams
of Lithium.

22:57.733 --> 22:59.344
It's prescribed for depression.

22:59.387 --> 23:01.694
Based on the prescription dates
and how full these are,

23:01.737 --> 23:04.566
I don't think Charlie was
following doctor's orders.

23:04.610 --> 23:07.047
This kid was clearly in
a dark place.

23:07.090 --> 23:08.396
- Guys.
- Ian.

23:08.440 --> 23:10.268
We need to know everything
that's on that laptop,

23:10.311 --> 23:13.401
every internet search,
message exchange...

23:13.445 --> 23:15.664
On it.

23:17.231 --> 23:19.451
He's got some basic
security protocols in place,

23:19.494 --> 23:21.322
but it shouldn't be too hard
to crack.

23:21.366 --> 23:23.455
Well, how long?

23:23.498 --> 23:25.196
Let's see.

23:27.067 --> 23:28.329
Yeah.

23:28.373 --> 23:30.940
Uploading the data to the jocks
as we speak.

23:30.984 --> 23:33.116
Remind me to never let you
near my laptop.

23:33.160 --> 23:34.683
We are troubled on every side,

23:34.727 --> 23:35.815
but not distressed.

23:35.858 --> 23:37.904
We are perplexed,
but not in despair.

23:37.947 --> 23:41.342
Persecuted, but not forsaken.
Cast down, but not destroyed.

23:41.386 --> 23:42.778
In other words,
how we doing, gang?

23:42.822 --> 23:44.563
We got a girl to find.
Let's get some leads going.

23:44.606 --> 23:45.955
Let's go, let's go.

23:45.999 --> 23:47.914
I did an analysis of
Charlie's timeline today.

23:47.957 --> 23:49.089
Yeah.

23:49.132 --> 23:50.090
So according to
his school records,

23:50.133 --> 23:51.352
he attended his first period,

23:51.396 --> 23:53.615
but he went missing for
second and third,

23:53.659 --> 23:56.096
returned to school for fourth,
and stayed at the school

23:56.139 --> 23:58.141
until Maggie and OA
made contact,

23:58.185 --> 24:00.840
which gives us about two hours
that are unaccounted for.

24:00.883 --> 24:03.321
During which time he grabbed
the inhaler at the pharmacy.

24:03.364 --> 24:06.672
And according to that
debit card found in his pocket,

24:06.715 --> 24:08.064
he bought a full tank of gas

24:08.108 --> 24:10.241
about five minutes after
he ran from the pharmacy.

24:10.284 --> 24:13.722
So I drew a circumference
of the maximum distance

24:13.766 --> 24:14.854
he could have traveled in

24:14.897 --> 24:16.638
the time period that
we're talking about.

24:16.682 --> 24:18.901
Impressive.

24:18.945 --> 24:20.816
Still a needle in a haystack.

24:20.860 --> 24:23.993
True, but I also had
soil samples analyzed

24:24.037 --> 24:26.082
from the tire tread on
Charlie's car.

24:26.126 --> 24:27.997
They show a certain combination
of elements

24:28.041 --> 24:29.956
only found in parts of
upstate New York.

24:29.999 --> 24:32.393
So soil samples, coupled with

24:32.437 --> 24:34.482
the calculations
based on gas used,

24:34.526 --> 24:36.832
indicate that we should be
looking for Elizabeth

24:36.876 --> 24:37.920
in the Pound Ridge area.

24:37.964 --> 24:39.226
Hey, great work.

24:39.270 --> 24:40.662
The haystack is getting smaller.

24:40.706 --> 24:42.751
But we haven't found the needle,

24:42.795 --> 24:44.840
so let's keep working.

24:47.669 --> 24:50.368
Okay.

24:50.411 --> 24:53.501
Do you own any property
in the Pound Ridge area?

24:53.545 --> 24:55.590
My father has a hunting cabin
up there,

24:55.634 --> 24:57.505
but we barely ever use it.

24:57.549 --> 25:00.203
What about your father?
Is he there now?

25:00.247 --> 25:03.946
No, he died a few months ago.

25:21.268 --> 25:23.226
Federal agents!

25:23.270 --> 25:25.141
- FBI!
- FBI!

25:25.185 --> 25:27.318
All right, in here.

25:27.361 --> 25:28.841
We got to flow this way.

25:28.884 --> 25:33.062
Maggie, I got something.

25:37.153 --> 25:40.940
Blood and a lot of it.

25:42.681 --> 25:44.422
It's better than a body.

25:49.623 --> 25:52.583
Elizabeth!

25:55.020 --> 25:58.328
Fan out!
Anything?

25:59.024 --> 26:02.898
Elizabeth!

26:02.941 --> 26:05.596
Elizabeth, federal agents!

26:10.340 --> 26:12.646
All right, throw me
some light this way.

26:12.690 --> 26:14.823
Hey, got something.

26:14.866 --> 26:16.041
On the tree line.

26:16.085 --> 26:19.392
All right.

26:20.959 --> 26:24.049
I need extra beam over here.

26:24.093 --> 26:27.226
OA.

26:31.100 --> 26:32.971
She's alive.

26:33.015 --> 26:34.755
We need a medic here right now.

26:37.367 --> 26:40.370
If you're up for it, Elizabeth,
can you tell us what happened?

26:41.850 --> 26:44.026
Um...

26:44.069 --> 26:48.769
I, uh, I had dinner
with my father last night.

26:48.813 --> 26:52.338
After we finished,
I looked for a cab.

26:52.382 --> 26:54.210
And then out of nowhere

26:54.253 --> 26:58.431
I felt this shock or jolt,

26:58.475 --> 27:01.826
um, and then someone grabbed me

27:01.870 --> 27:03.959
and threw me in a car.

27:06.918 --> 27:10.356
Do you know a Charlie Jacobs?

27:10.400 --> 27:12.663
No, I don't think so.
Why?

27:12.706 --> 27:15.884
We think he was the one
that abducted you.

27:15.927 --> 27:18.843
Did he assault you in any way?

27:18.887 --> 27:21.759
Physically, sexually...

27:21.802 --> 27:24.675
No, no, he never touched me.

27:27.373 --> 27:29.506
So these cuts and scrapes...

27:31.987 --> 27:34.990
When I heard them leave,
I broke a glass.

27:35.033 --> 27:38.732
I needed something sharp
to cut through the rope.

27:38.776 --> 27:39.908
I'm sorry, "them"?

27:39.951 --> 27:42.258
Yeah, there were two of them.

27:42.301 --> 27:45.826
And you didn't see
either one of them?

27:45.870 --> 27:50.005
No, I had a hood over my head
the whole time,

27:50.048 --> 27:51.745
but I could hear them talking.

27:51.789 --> 27:53.269
It was sort of muffled,

27:53.312 --> 27:54.748
but I knew there were
two of them.

27:54.792 --> 27:56.837
Okay, did they say anything
that might be helpful,

27:56.881 --> 28:00.232
use each other's names?

28:00.276 --> 28:03.453
Names, no.
No.

28:03.496 --> 28:06.369
But I heard them talking about
killing people,

28:06.412 --> 28:08.980
kids, students.

28:13.637 --> 28:15.552
Ian cracked the code on
Charlie's computer

28:15.595 --> 28:16.814
and Elizabeth was right.

28:16.857 --> 28:18.729
Charlie Jacobs
and suspect number two were

28:18.772 --> 28:20.513
planning a mass shooting event.

28:20.557 --> 28:22.559
We get the name of
the other kid?

28:22.602 --> 28:25.170
No, we just have
a gamer handle, Lazarus.

28:25.214 --> 28:26.955
Do we know the target location?

28:26.998 --> 28:29.131
Wheeler High gymnasium,
there's a game tomorrow night

28:29.174 --> 28:30.784
between Wheeler and Sherwood.

28:30.828 --> 28:33.048
Or there was.
I just canceled it.

28:33.091 --> 28:35.833
Guys, Lazarus just popped up
on Charlie's DMs.

28:35.876 --> 28:38.836
Fantastic.

28:38.879 --> 28:41.795
It's a direct message
to Charlie asking, "What's up"?

28:41.839 --> 28:44.015
Our second suspect must not
know he's dead.

28:44.059 --> 28:46.061
Because of Charlie's age,
his name wasn't released.

28:46.104 --> 28:48.889
Try to engage him,
lure him to the country house.

28:48.933 --> 28:51.022
Tell him that Elizabeth's sick
and you're worried.

28:51.066 --> 28:52.067
If I can keep him on
long enough,

28:52.110 --> 28:54.678
I can do a reverse ping
on his IP.

29:25.926 --> 29:27.580
Hey.

29:27.624 --> 29:29.582
Charlie's dad's just made
the local news.

29:29.626 --> 29:32.455
Okay, tell him if he doesn't
come fast, you're gonna leave.

29:32.498 --> 29:34.283
We don't have much time.

29:52.649 --> 29:55.217
Oh.

29:55.260 --> 29:56.566
Thirty more seconds
and I would have had

29:56.609 --> 29:58.220
an exact location pinned.

29:58.263 --> 29:59.830
So, you got nothing?

29:59.873 --> 30:02.746
No, we have something.
It's just not exact.

30:02.789 --> 30:06.228
Best I can do is narrow it
to a three-block area

30:06.271 --> 30:09.231
over by Church and Broadway
in Lower Manhattan.

30:10.971 --> 30:12.582
- She needs her rest.
- Benjamin.

30:12.625 --> 30:13.974
Whatever it is, it can wait.

30:14.018 --> 30:15.063
I'm sorry, it really can't.

30:15.106 --> 30:17.674
No, Dad, just let them
talk to me.

30:17.717 --> 30:19.197
We just need a minute.

30:20.677 --> 30:23.506
How are you feeling, Elizabeth?

30:23.549 --> 30:26.030
Better.

30:26.074 --> 30:28.076
We're trying to find
the second person,

30:28.119 --> 30:30.078
so I just thought I'd come by
and ask you again

30:30.121 --> 30:33.907
if you remember hearing
any names, places...

30:33.951 --> 30:36.127
No.
No, I'm sorry.

30:36.171 --> 30:38.564
Does the name Lazarus
mean anything to you?

30:42.307 --> 30:45.702
Do you know anybody
who lives in that area?

30:47.486 --> 30:49.880
I... yeah.

30:49.923 --> 30:52.230
Yeah, I tutor someone over here.

30:52.274 --> 30:54.841
He lives on Church Street.

30:54.885 --> 30:57.366
His name is Sam.

30:59.194 --> 31:00.847
Wait, is he the other kid?

31:00.891 --> 31:02.849
We don't know.

31:02.893 --> 31:06.766
Do you consider yourself
friends with Sam?

31:06.810 --> 31:08.942
Yesterday he asked me out.

31:11.249 --> 31:13.686
I said no,
'cause I have a boyfriend.

31:13.730 --> 31:15.993
I'm gonna watch him
in a basketball game tomorrow.

31:16.036 --> 31:17.429
He's on the team.

31:17.473 --> 31:19.823
The one tomorrow night
between Wheeler and Sherwood?

31:19.866 --> 31:21.259
Yeah.

31:21.303 --> 31:23.522
How did Sam react when
you said no?

31:26.003 --> 31:29.833
He joked that I'd be sorry,

31:29.876 --> 31:32.488
because he was gonna be
really famous one day.

31:37.362 --> 31:40.191
We're about three minutes
away from Sam's house.

31:40.235 --> 31:42.367
Good, the subject's
full name is Samuel Musk.

31:42.411 --> 31:44.630
He's 17 years old.
He's a senior at Wheeler.

31:44.674 --> 31:46.632
And like Charlie,
his social media profiles

31:46.676 --> 31:48.547
indicate significant
social isolation

31:48.591 --> 31:49.940
and a lot of anger.

31:49.983 --> 31:51.985
Ian, you have anything to add?

31:52.029 --> 31:54.205
Based on their texting,
it looks like Charlie and Sam

31:54.249 --> 31:56.381
made contact about
three months ago.

31:56.425 --> 31:58.427
Which one was the alpha
of the two?

31:58.470 --> 32:00.429
Definitely Sam.
He's the one who chose

32:00.472 --> 32:02.213
the basketball game
as the target.

32:02.257 --> 32:03.954
Right, because he found out
Elizabeth's boyfriend was

32:03.997 --> 32:05.390
one of the players.

32:05.434 --> 32:06.870
So he had Charlie follow her
to the restaurant

32:06.913 --> 32:08.219
and told him to put her
somewhere safe

32:08.263 --> 32:09.612
until after the shooting.

32:09.655 --> 32:11.657
All because he liked her
and wanted to impress her.

32:11.701 --> 32:13.920
Yeah, Charlie wasn't happy
about it, either.

32:13.964 --> 32:15.966
He really didn't care if
Elizabeth died or not.

32:16.009 --> 32:19.665
Like a good beta, Charlie
did what Sam told him to do.

32:19.709 --> 32:21.493
We're almost at the house.
Anything else we should know?

32:21.537 --> 32:23.321
Yeah, Sam just posted on
social media,

32:23.365 --> 32:25.236
says he's gonna be famous today.

32:27.238 --> 32:28.326
Got it.

32:28.370 --> 32:29.675
And another thing to know,

32:29.719 --> 32:31.286
his father has
several handguns registered

32:31.329 --> 32:32.722
in his name, so be careful.

32:32.765 --> 32:34.854
Maggie, OA,
I know this kid is young,

32:34.898 --> 32:36.856
but he is extremely dangerous.

32:36.900 --> 32:38.293
If deadly force is necessary,

32:38.336 --> 32:41.078
do not hesitate
to take the shot.

32:41.121 --> 32:42.645
Okay.

32:42.688 --> 32:43.907
FBI!

32:43.950 --> 32:46.039
Show me your hands!
Show me your hands!

32:46.083 --> 32:47.606
Okay.
What the hell's going on?

32:47.650 --> 32:48.999
Upstairs!

32:49.042 --> 32:52.394
Run the wall.

32:52.437 --> 32:54.570
- He good?
- Good.

32:56.093 --> 32:57.050
Where's Sam?

32:57.094 --> 32:58.965
Um, he left a few minutes ago,

32:59.009 --> 33:01.098
said some kid he knew
just died, committed suicide.

33:01.141 --> 33:02.404
Was Sam on foot?

33:02.447 --> 33:04.232
No, he's on his scooter.

33:04.275 --> 33:05.885
Is someone gonna tell me
what's going on?

33:05.929 --> 33:07.844
The room's clear.

33:07.887 --> 33:09.585
Is the scooter registered
to his name?

33:09.628 --> 33:10.847
Yeah.

33:10.890 --> 33:12.501
Put out an APB to
local law enforcement.

33:12.544 --> 33:14.329
He's to be detained on sight.

33:14.372 --> 33:17.027
You own firearms.
Where do you keep them?

33:22.032 --> 33:23.686
For our safety and yours,

33:23.729 --> 33:25.340
when it's unlocked,
please step away.

33:25.383 --> 33:26.906
Sam doesn't have
the combination,

33:26.950 --> 33:28.952
so there's no need to worry.

33:33.304 --> 33:35.306
Looks like you're wrong
about that.

33:41.269 --> 33:44.315
I'm not making excuses,

33:44.359 --> 33:46.578
but he lost his mother
to cancer last year.

33:48.406 --> 33:52.889
He has issues, severe ADHD.

33:52.932 --> 33:54.151
I'm trying my best to help him,

33:54.194 --> 33:55.587
but since my wife passed
it's been hard.

33:55.631 --> 33:57.415
You need to call your son
right now.

33:57.459 --> 33:59.330
Don't tell him we're here.
Just ask him to come home.

34:04.683 --> 34:07.120
Sam, hey, it's me.

34:07.164 --> 34:09.297
If you get this message,
please call me right away.

34:09.340 --> 34:12.300
It's really, really important.

34:17.609 --> 34:20.132
I love you, buddy.

34:20.177 --> 34:22.353
Please don't do
something stupid.

34:24.529 --> 34:26.574
I'd help you if I could.
I...

34:26.618 --> 34:30.621
Please, he's just a kid.
Don't hurt him.

34:30.666 --> 34:32.536
What happens from this point on

34:32.581 --> 34:35.322
is up to him, not us.

34:41.139 --> 34:42.837
According to Sam's dad,
the kid's in possession of

34:42.880 --> 34:45.274
a modified SOG AR-15,
three handguns,

34:45.317 --> 34:47.972
and enough ammo to kill
dozens of people.

34:48.016 --> 34:50.409
Kris, we need you to work
your magic.

34:50.453 --> 34:51.715
Where's this kid heading?

34:51.759 --> 34:53.674
He turned off his phone
after his last post,

34:53.717 --> 34:57.199
and he's on a scooter,
so there's no GPS to tap into.

34:57.242 --> 34:59.114
But wait, um, let me see if

34:59.157 --> 35:01.899
I can tap into
the traffic cam database.

35:07.775 --> 35:08.950
Wait, I got him.

35:08.993 --> 35:10.125
Yeah?

35:10.168 --> 35:11.126
Yeah, he blew through
two red lights

35:11.169 --> 35:12.344
in the last ten minutes.

35:12.388 --> 35:13.606
Looks like he's still in
Lower Manhattan.

35:13.650 --> 35:15.478
Okay, crime fighters,
check it out.

35:15.521 --> 35:17.567
Sam must have not take
those guns for fun.

35:17.610 --> 35:20.483
We need a target befitting
a young, disturbed mind.

35:20.526 --> 35:23.051
The basketball game was
his first idea.

35:23.094 --> 35:24.182
What is his second?

35:24.226 --> 35:26.532
Let's go, let's go!

35:26.576 --> 35:28.273
He was blowing lights
at regular intervals

35:28.317 --> 35:29.753
for the past ten minutes,
but now nothing.

35:29.797 --> 35:32.147
The last cross was
Eastbound and 57th Street.

35:32.190 --> 35:34.323
Okay, we're about
three blocks behind him.

35:34.366 --> 35:35.890
I synced traffic cams
in that area

35:35.933 --> 35:37.326
to alert us to his plate.

35:37.369 --> 35:39.502
We were getting reports
every 15 seconds or so,

35:39.545 --> 35:41.547
but no longer.

35:41.591 --> 35:44.420
Yeah, it means he's arrived
at his intended destination.

35:44.463 --> 35:46.378
I want snapshots of
possible targets

35:46.422 --> 35:48.424
in that area near 57th Street.

35:53.472 --> 35:55.518
Okay, accounting for Sam's
need for fame

35:55.561 --> 35:58.564
and the target demographic
he seems to despise,

35:58.608 --> 36:00.392
I have a dozen possibilities.

36:00.436 --> 36:01.829
That's about ten too many.

36:01.872 --> 36:03.787
We don't have the time
or resources to cover them all.

36:03.831 --> 36:05.789
This kid's about notoriety,
think movie theaters,

36:05.833 --> 36:07.095
restaurants, malls...

36:07.138 --> 36:09.532
Focus on venues that
are populated with

36:09.575 --> 36:12.753
successful, athletic,
high-achieving students.

36:12.796 --> 36:15.320
Wait, didn't
Benjamin's assistant say

36:15.364 --> 36:17.366
something about a college fair
taking place today?

36:17.409 --> 36:19.107
Where's it taking place?

36:22.719 --> 36:24.199
945 Third Avenue.

36:24.242 --> 36:25.983
It's two blocks away from
our last sighting,

36:26.027 --> 36:27.071
and it starts in ten minutes.

36:27.115 --> 36:28.159
Go, go, go!

36:28.203 --> 36:30.858
There he is, the door.

36:38.343 --> 36:40.998
- Stop!
- He's got a gun!

36:41.042 --> 36:42.391
Look out, look out!
He's got a gun, he's got a gun!

36:46.917 --> 36:49.137
Hey!
Drop the weapon now.

36:49.180 --> 36:50.312
It's over, Sam.

36:50.355 --> 36:51.835
Drop your weapon
and put your hands

36:51.879 --> 36:54.185
where we can see them.

37:01.323 --> 37:06.023
No, I'm not gonna let you
take this away from me.

37:06.067 --> 37:07.546
Sam, you don't drop your weapon,

37:07.590 --> 37:10.332
we're gonna shoot you.

37:10.375 --> 37:13.378
Sam, put the gun down.

37:15.554 --> 37:18.470
No.

37:18.514 --> 37:21.865
I don't need to do anything.

37:21.909 --> 37:26.000
I make the rules.
This is my day.

37:26.043 --> 37:28.959
Yeah, you're right,
this is your day.

37:29.003 --> 37:31.005
Look around.

37:31.048 --> 37:34.269
Everybody's watching,
you're already famous.

37:37.272 --> 37:40.275
Drop the weapon so you can
walk away.

37:52.113 --> 37:53.505
OA!

38:00.991 --> 38:03.428
Hey!
Hank, hurry!

38:03.472 --> 38:04.865
Get him out of here right away.

38:04.908 --> 38:05.909
OA.

38:05.953 --> 38:07.693
Hey, it's okay.
It's okay.

38:11.610 --> 38:13.917
Hold on, OA.
Hold on.

38:13.961 --> 38:15.919
You're okay,
it didn't go through.

38:15.963 --> 38:17.790
You're okay.
You're okay.

38:19.880 --> 38:21.794
It's still gonna leave a mark.

38:29.367 --> 38:32.196
You're gonna be fine.
Luckily, no ribs were broken.

38:32.240 --> 38:35.243
Thank you.

38:36.374 --> 38:38.202
What you did was stupid.

38:38.246 --> 38:40.378
You know that, right?

38:40.422 --> 38:41.989
Yeah.

38:42.032 --> 38:44.948
An innocent bystander
could have been killed.

38:44.992 --> 38:46.776
- I know...
- No, OA.

38:46.819 --> 38:48.952
You could have been killed.

38:51.912 --> 38:54.088
I know.

38:54.131 --> 38:55.437
I just acted on instinct.

38:55.480 --> 38:59.006
Instinct?
Your instinct was reckless.

39:03.619 --> 39:07.318
And it scared me.
Don't do that again.

39:16.675 --> 39:18.764
Your son is on the second floor.

39:18.808 --> 39:21.942
He's under psych detention.

39:21.985 --> 39:24.335
I know, uh...

39:26.120 --> 39:29.775
I heard what you did,
and I, uh...

39:31.386 --> 39:33.040
I wanted to thank you.

39:39.176 --> 39:42.266
You saved Sam's life...

39:45.052 --> 39:47.532
And I'm so grateful.

39:53.582 --> 39:55.062
Okay.

40:31.054 --> 40:33.535
The girl's safe,
the suspect is in custody,

40:33.578 --> 40:35.189
I have no other comment
than that.

40:35.232 --> 40:37.800
And the less publicity
this gets, the better.

40:39.889 --> 40:41.369
Ugh.

40:41.412 --> 40:44.067
The FBI Press Liaison
wanting the official statement.

40:44.111 --> 40:45.547
What's up?
You need something?

40:45.590 --> 40:48.376
Well, this is probably
a bad time...

40:48.419 --> 40:51.292
No, no, no, it's fine.
What is it?

40:51.335 --> 40:55.557
I sent you an email
about my Academy application...

40:55.600 --> 40:57.211
Yes, I saw that.

40:57.254 --> 40:59.648
I've been meaning to
talk to you about that.

40:59.691 --> 41:03.260
Oh, I see.

41:03.304 --> 41:05.871
You start June 1st.

41:07.438 --> 41:09.440
Wait, I'm sorry.
What?

41:09.484 --> 41:11.747
I spoke to my friend
at Quantico yesterday,

41:11.790 --> 41:14.793
and I told him you would make
a fantastic agent.

41:14.837 --> 41:18.580
So he looked at
your application and agreed.

41:18.623 --> 41:19.798
Oh.

41:19.842 --> 41:22.975
I may not say much,
but I see everything,

41:23.019 --> 41:25.978
and I definitely see you.

41:28.329 --> 41:32.072
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

41:32.115 --> 41:33.856
Ah.

41:35.945 --> 41:38.469
Sorry.
