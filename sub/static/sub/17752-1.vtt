01:00.880 --> 01:04.793
I work in Human Resources
or "HR," as some people call it.

01:04.879 --> 01:07.314
And I have this poster
in my office that says,

01:07.400 --> 01:09.960
"Keep calm and go to your safe place."

01:10.520 --> 01:14.149
Well, when I get a little stressed out
or my anxiety spikes,

01:14.240 --> 01:16.959
I close my eyes
and picture my cul-de-sac,

01:17.040 --> 01:21.113
and my wonderful wife, Karen,
and our two sons, Patrick and Mikey.

01:21.200 --> 01:24.988
Because that's the place where I know
everything is always okay.

01:26.280 --> 01:27.474
No matter what.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.456
Bye, Mikey, Patrick.
Bye, you guys.

01:36.600 --> 01:37.600
Bye, guys.

01:37.680 --> 01:39.136
You can text us
the minute you get to camp.

01:39.160 --> 01:40.195
Yeah, okay.

01:40.280 --> 01:42.136
And if you get any ticks,
put it in the plastic baggie

01:42.160 --> 01:45.277
with the date and time of the bite,
and I'll get them tested.

01:45.360 --> 01:47.794
Change your socks. Okay, guys?
Change your socks.

01:47.920 --> 01:49.376
We love you. We love you.
We're gonna miss you.

01:49.400 --> 01:50.958
- Love you guys!
- Have so much fun!

01:51.040 --> 01:52.040
Be strong!

01:53.080 --> 01:54.160
Be strong.

01:56.200 --> 01:57.792
Oh.

01:59.920 --> 02:02.070
Did that bus driver
look sober to you, honey?

02:02.160 --> 02:04.879
Because he gave me a really weird look
when I smelled his breath.

02:04.960 --> 02:06.791
Well, I think you just startled him.

02:07.280 --> 02:08.633
Huh! Look, there's Meg.

02:08.720 --> 02:09.755
Hey, Meg.

02:10.479 --> 02:12.596
- Whoo! I sold it.
- Oh!

02:12.680 --> 02:14.716
- That was so fast.
- Thank you.

02:14.800 --> 02:16.028
All cash buyers.

02:16.120 --> 02:17.553
All cash buyers? That's fancy.

02:17.640 --> 02:20.438
Yeah. And the best part is,
they didn't even see it.

02:20.520 --> 02:22.158
They just saw the pictures online.

02:22.240 --> 02:24.470
I haven't even met them
in person. It's crazy.

02:24.560 --> 02:27.279
Who buys a house
without seeing it first?

02:27.360 --> 02:29.590
I know. Maybe it's a celebrity,
you know?

02:29.680 --> 02:32.148
Come on, Jeff.
No celebrity is gonna move here.

02:32.240 --> 02:34.879
I hope it's not some kind of
meth lab situation.

02:35.720 --> 02:36.994
Oh. There he is.

02:37.160 --> 02:39.230
- Sorry.
- Where have you been?

02:40.080 --> 02:41.991
Kinko's was bananas.

02:42.080 --> 02:43.308
It often is.

02:43.400 --> 02:44.833
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:44.920 --> 02:46.717
So exciting. New neighbors, right?

02:46.800 --> 02:49.234
Oh, and, Karen,
I left your card in the foyer,

02:49.320 --> 02:51.550
- just in case they want a decorator.
- Thank you.

02:52.520 --> 02:53.856
So, uh, did you tell

02:53.880 --> 02:56.633
Jeff about my new idea
for the guest bathroom?

02:57.920 --> 02:59.433
No.

02:59.520 --> 03:01.192
Artist's loft.

03:01.280 --> 03:03.032
Think Brooklyn, okay?

03:03.160 --> 03:05.958
Exposed brick,
visible plumbing. And...

03:06.360 --> 03:07.429
A urinal.

03:07.560 --> 03:09.039
A urinal!

03:09.120 --> 03:12.112
That's really for me.
Meg wants me standing up again.

03:14.560 --> 03:17.393
Well, I suppose I'd better get started
on the urinal.

03:18.240 --> 03:22.677
Yeah, no. I know
what you're getting started on.

03:22.760 --> 03:24.830
Empty house, kids are gone.

03:24.920 --> 03:26.353
Wow-chick-a-wow-wow!

03:26.440 --> 03:27.440
Please.

03:27.560 --> 03:30.313
- Honeymoon.
- All right, keep it PG, guys.

03:30.400 --> 03:33.233
Well, we gotta go
flyer the subdivision anyway.

03:33.320 --> 03:36.073
- We're gonna pound the pavement.
- Yeah.

03:36.640 --> 03:38.760
- Jeff, you should try it hyena style.
- We'll try it.

03:41.600 --> 03:43.079
That's the noise I make.

03:44.040 --> 03:46.713
I think Meg has changed up
her medication, honey.

03:46.800 --> 03:48.840
- What's Dan's excuse then?
- Ugh.

03:49.120 --> 03:50.856
Some of that stuff
they were saying was demented.

03:50.880 --> 03:52.359
- Disgusting.
- Yeah.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
Phew!

03:56.080 --> 03:58.435
But maybe they have a point.
I don't know.

03:59.840 --> 04:00.909
Alone in the house.

04:02.320 --> 04:03.753
First time in a long time.

04:04.200 --> 04:06.316
Yeah, I mean,

Great. I'll make popcorn.

05:01.360 --> 05:03.351
- Back it up.
- You got it.

05:03.440 --> 05:05.576
- How much room we got?
- Almost there.

05:05.600 --> 05:06.828
Hey, Bernie.

05:06.920 --> 05:09.201
New neighbors aren't wasting
any time moving in, are they?

05:09.480 --> 05:10.515
Nope.

05:12.120 --> 05:13.576
You're gonna clean that up,
right, Berno?

05:13.600 --> 05:14.669
Always do.

05:14.760 --> 05:16.671
Okay, have a good one.

05:18.920 --> 05:20.360
Come on, guys. Let's get outta here.

05:20.440 --> 05:21.998
Come on, fellas. Let's go. Come on.

05:31.320 --> 05:32.594
Hi, Jack. Good morning.

05:32.680 --> 05:34.910
Don't let anybody say that to you
on a plane. "Hijack."

05:35.200 --> 05:36.256
Good morning, anyway.

05:36.280 --> 05:37.315
Morning.

05:39.520 --> 05:40.555
Hi, Diane.

05:43.640 --> 05:44.993
Jeff, good morning.

05:45.560 --> 05:46.629
See those moving vans?

05:46.720 --> 05:48.472
Oh. Couldn't miss them.

05:48.560 --> 05:49.754
- Gosh!
- So,

05:49.840 --> 05:51.876
- any word on the new neighbors?
- No.

05:51.960 --> 05:53.109
- Anything?
- Nothing.

05:53.200 --> 05:54.792
Guarantee they're no Dave and Bridget.

05:54.880 --> 05:56.950
Well, at least the summer's
not a total loss.

05:57.040 --> 05:58.996
I mean, we got Junetoberfest
to look forward to.

05:59.080 --> 06:00.559
- Yes, we do.
- And our jobs.

06:00.640 --> 06:01.914
Always have our jobs.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.479
By the way, how's it going upstairs?

06:04.400 --> 06:07.551
Jesus, Jeff. You know I can't
talk about what we do upstairs.

06:07.640 --> 06:09.119
Yeah. I know. It's all right.

06:09.200 --> 06:10.633
Uh... Hey, oh, by the way,

06:10.720 --> 06:12.392
I still have those, uh,
indoor skydiving

06:12.480 --> 06:13.959
lessons if you wanna join me.

06:14.160 --> 06:15.388
My treat.

06:15.920 --> 06:18.798
Uh, this week's really hectic.
Kid stuff. But, maybe.

06:18.880 --> 06:20.438
Just text me. Or I'll text you.

06:20.560 --> 06:22.630
Okay, we'll talk about it later.
Have a good one.

06:22.720 --> 06:24.560
- All right.
- Hey, Sheila. Good morning.

06:25.800 --> 06:26.800
Morning, Louise.

06:27.360 --> 06:28.588
Morning, Sharon.

06:28.680 --> 06:30.511
Hi, Jeff. Dr. Fisher called.

06:30.600 --> 06:31.635
Yeah? What did he say?

06:31.720 --> 06:35.474
He said, "Please tell Jeff to stop
texting me about indoor skydiving."

06:35.560 --> 06:38.632
He's joking. He's a riot. Hey, Doug.

06:48.120 --> 06:49.155
Hey, Sanjay.

06:49.240 --> 06:51.913
Hey, uh, Jeff.
Can I use your computer?

06:52.000 --> 06:53.718
I need to reorder my anti-depressants.

06:53.920 --> 06:55.672
Of course. Mi computer, su computer.

06:56.840 --> 06:58.193
Where are you? Who's that?

06:58.400 --> 06:59.753
Oh, this is Jeff.

07:00.800 --> 07:04.110
Jeff lets me use his computer because
security prohibits Internet upstairs.

07:04.600 --> 07:07.637
And why does Jeff have Internet?

07:07.760 --> 07:10.399
Because Jeff does unimportant work.

07:10.960 --> 07:12.757
Human Resources.

07:12.840 --> 07:15.400
Are we getting written up?
'Cause I emailed him last night

07:15.520 --> 07:18.273
and apologized.
He said he was fine. And we have

07:18.440 --> 07:20.635
- put this behind us.
- It's all fine.

07:20.840 --> 07:24.435
I wouldn't be doing my job if we
didn't go over a couple of exercises.

07:24.520 --> 07:26.829
So, grab a stress ball.

07:27.480 --> 07:28.515
Really?

07:28.600 --> 07:30.750
Okay, so, Margaret's gonna
show us, uh...

07:31.760 --> 07:33.398
the, uh, meaning of trust.

07:34.360 --> 07:36.316
- Hey, Sanjay?
- Yeah?

07:36.400 --> 07:39.392
Did I tell you that I ate at
a Indian restaurant the other night?

07:40.400 --> 07:42.960
Yeah, I had to call
and make an Indian reservation.

07:43.560 --> 07:46.518
Yang, tell Oren how he makes you feel.

07:50.320 --> 07:52.788
Maybe you should just write us up.
That might be easier.

07:52.880 --> 07:55.997
I once knew an Indian who drank
so much tea, he died in his "tea-pee."

07:57.520 --> 07:58.576
That was a good one.

07:58.600 --> 08:00.238
Okay, Margaret. Go ahead.

08:50.560 --> 08:51.754
Wow.

08:52.480 --> 08:54.755
Yes, I do feel
like you are jealous.

08:54.840 --> 08:56.353
I can sense the resentment

08:56.440 --> 08:59.432
every time I bring up
gravitational perturbations.

08:59.520 --> 09:01.456
Is that bad? That sounds bad.
What is that? Is that like, uh...

09:01.480 --> 09:04.278
Gravitational perturbations?
That's a laugh!

09:04.600 --> 09:05.919
Plus, what about my work?

09:06.000 --> 09:07.560
I mentioned velocity vectors
one time...

09:10.040 --> 09:11.109
One time,

09:11.200 --> 09:13.350
and you try to get me
bumped down to Dhameer's team?

09:13.440 --> 09:15.476
You were supposed
to calculate...

09:19.400 --> 09:21.789
This is all because
I hooked up with Sharada.

09:21.880 --> 09:23.920
You what?
You hooked up with Sharada Ganjali?

09:24.040 --> 09:25.632
I'll kill you!

09:28.520 --> 09:31.398
Oren, this is no way
to settle a workplace dispute!

09:31.480 --> 09:32.913
Sharon, call security!

09:39.000 --> 09:40.149
Hiya, Jeff!

09:43.760 --> 09:45.352
- Karen.
- Hey, honey!

09:46.400 --> 09:47.753
Hey, darling.

09:48.640 --> 09:50.039
Still spying on the neighbors?

09:51.440 --> 09:52.759
Hi, there.

09:54.160 --> 09:55.160
Hello.

09:56.880 --> 09:57.915
You must be Jeff.

09:58.400 --> 09:59.958
I'm Tim. This is my wife, Natalie.

10:00.040 --> 10:03.112
We're the Joneses!
Nice to meet you, Jeff.

10:03.200 --> 10:05.456
Nice to meet you guys.
Uh, that was a joke about spying...

10:05.480 --> 10:07.869
It's a joke. I'd never spy on anyone.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.353
We love humor.

10:10.520 --> 10:11.555
Humor...

10:12.360 --> 10:16.478
So, Natalie was just telling me that
she's a social media consultant.

10:16.560 --> 10:18.437
Yeah. I also write a cooking blog.

10:18.520 --> 10:19.919
Oh, I love blogs.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.798
Yeah, and I work with a charity
for Sri Lankan orphans.

10:23.360 --> 10:25.590
Those are my biggest passions.

10:25.680 --> 10:26.829
Natalie's got a big heart.

10:26.920 --> 10:28.512
Aw, thank you, baby.

10:30.440 --> 10:31.634
Yeah, um...

10:32.280 --> 10:33.896
- Why don't you tell them about, uh...
- What?

10:33.920 --> 10:36.434
She has passions too. Why don't you
tell them about the urinal?

10:37.000 --> 10:38.136
No, honey!

10:38.160 --> 10:39.309
It's nothing.

10:39.400 --> 10:40.920
Oh, no, please. It sounds interesting.

10:41.160 --> 10:44.436
I'm picking up a slight accent.
Is that Pittsburgh, maybe?

10:44.520 --> 10:46.750
- She's from Greece.
- Oh, God.

10:46.840 --> 10:48.193
No, but we've lived all over.

10:48.280 --> 10:51.636
And now, it's finally time
to plant some roots. Right?

10:51.920 --> 10:52.920
Oh...

10:53.080 --> 10:56.834
I can't tell you how excited we are
to be here on Maple Circle.

10:56.920 --> 10:58.069
Such a lovely street.

10:58.160 --> 10:59.229
- It really is.
- Oh.

10:59.320 --> 11:00.719
- Thank you.
- We love it.

11:00.800 --> 11:03.496
It's fascinating. In other cultures,
they don't have anything like this.

11:03.520 --> 11:04.714
No, they don't.

11:04.800 --> 11:06.028
In Chinese, for example.

11:06.120 --> 11:07.776
They don't even have a word
for a street like this.

11:07.800 --> 11:08.915
What? For cul-de-sac?

11:09.000 --> 11:10.956
No. No. I mean, they would say...

11:12.920 --> 11:14.399
Which is, loosely,

11:14.480 --> 11:16.391
- "happy place of heart and mind."
- Right.

11:16.480 --> 11:19.074
But it doesn't really capture
the essence of it, right?

11:19.160 --> 11:20.718
But it's cool coming
out of your mouth.

11:22.040 --> 11:24.031
- Tim's a travel writer.
- Oh! Really?

11:24.160 --> 11:25.957
- Wow! We love to travel.
- We do.

11:26.080 --> 11:29.436
Yeah. We went to Epcot Center
last summer, was it? Yeah.

11:29.520 --> 11:32.512
You can go to every country,
like, within three blocks.

11:32.600 --> 11:34.352
Perfect. That's what we like about it.

11:34.440 --> 11:35.616
We went with the boys over there.

11:35.640 --> 11:37.496
That's Patrick and Mikey.
Patrick's leaning

11:37.520 --> 11:39.240
against the wheel.
He's just a real cuddler.

11:39.840 --> 11:41.239
- They're beautiful.
- Adorable.

11:41.600 --> 11:43.033
Mikey, uh, made this.

11:43.120 --> 11:44.678
- Oh! Wow!
- What a talent!

11:44.920 --> 11:47.832
- Speaking of which, we brought you...
- Yes, yes.

11:47.920 --> 11:48.920
...a little something.

11:49.640 --> 11:50.675
What?

11:50.760 --> 11:53.718
- That's amazing! Really?
- Give me a break!

11:53.800 --> 11:54.800
I made it myself.

11:54.880 --> 11:57.110
- You made it yourself?
- Mmm-hmm.

11:58.360 --> 11:59.360
Oh...

11:59.440 --> 12:00.919
Wow. Look at this.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.200
- What is this?
- What is that?

12:02.240 --> 12:03.240
A sculpture.

12:03.320 --> 12:04.673
Tim blows his own glass.

12:04.760 --> 12:06.557
Look at it in the light, honey.
It sort of...

12:06.640 --> 12:08.437
- That's gorgeous. Look at that.
- Gorgeous.

12:08.520 --> 12:09.669
- You made that?
- Yeah,

12:09.760 --> 12:11.239
it's a hobby I picked up in Hungary.

12:11.320 --> 12:15.632
I wrote an article about this, uh,
Hungarian glass-blowing master, Yorgi.

12:16.280 --> 12:18.936
- Thank you. I don't know what to say.
- Oh, you don't need to say anything.

12:18.960 --> 12:21.838
Just put it right there
and use it as a conversation piece.

12:21.920 --> 12:23.831
- That's cool. Thank you very much!
- Thank you.

12:23.920 --> 12:25.831
- Anyway, we should get going.
- Yeah.

12:26.080 --> 12:27.877
- Yeah. We should.
- Oh. Okay.

12:27.960 --> 12:30.030
Uh, I feel like I should
give you guys a gift.

12:30.120 --> 12:31.416
I didn't know we were giving gifts.

12:31.440 --> 12:33.136
- That's not necessary.
- You want a stress ball?

12:33.160 --> 12:34.576
No, you don't want a stress ball.
That would be stupid.

12:34.600 --> 12:35.600
I'd love a stress ball.

12:35.760 --> 12:37.256
- Thank you.
- Yes! They really work.

12:37.280 --> 12:38.280
Thank you.

12:38.400 --> 12:40.416
- Let me just get this out of your way.
- No, Jeff will get that.

12:40.440 --> 12:41.668
- No, no, no.
- That's nice.

12:41.760 --> 12:43.478
It's all good. We're neighbors now.

12:43.920 --> 12:45.035
All right.

12:45.160 --> 12:49.119
Have you guys ever, uh, been to
or heard of, uh, Junetoberfest?

12:50.200 --> 12:51.918
- Junetoberfest?
- Yeah.

12:52.040 --> 12:53.439
You guys should really come.

12:53.520 --> 12:55.511
It's our annual summer get-together.

12:55.760 --> 12:57.616
The whole neighborhood comes.
A really fun group.

12:57.640 --> 12:58.680
A lot of us work together.

12:58.880 --> 12:59.949
At MBI?

13:00.080 --> 13:03.629
Yeah. We have a dart tournament.
We have bratwurst.

13:03.760 --> 13:05.591
I make my own home brew,
which is my passion.

13:05.720 --> 13:06.755
Good!

13:06.840 --> 13:08.256
How'd you know that Jeff works at MBI?

13:08.280 --> 13:09.280
Hmm?

13:09.680 --> 13:11.398
Jeff must've mentioned it.
Right, Jeff?

13:11.560 --> 13:13.471
- No. No, he didn't.
- That's okay, honey...

13:13.560 --> 13:14.640
No, Jeff didn't mention it.

13:16.440 --> 13:17.440
The stress ball.

13:17.520 --> 13:18.856
Must've been a lucky guess,
I guess.

13:18.880 --> 13:21.440
- No, it's right there.
- Lucky guess. Yeah, we should go.

13:21.480 --> 13:23.994
It's getting late.
Thank you so much for everything.

13:24.080 --> 13:25.832
The coffee was delicious.

13:25.920 --> 13:27.880
- Thank you.
- And we'll see you at Junetoberfest!

13:32.680 --> 13:34.760
So, let me show you a picture.
This is Tyler.

13:34.840 --> 13:36.831
And Tyler's gonna go
to asthma camp this summer.

13:36.960 --> 13:39.076
Oh, my God! He's so handsome!

13:43.960 --> 13:46.030
- Hiya, neighbor.
- Hey.

13:46.120 --> 13:47.439
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:47.520 --> 13:48.873
"Seared yellowtail

13:49.360 --> 13:51.760
with lemon zest and ginger shavings."
Who the hell made this?

13:51.800 --> 13:54.234
Natalie. Apparently,
she can do everything.

13:54.320 --> 13:56.993
I'm sorry, but who wears that
to a barbecue?

13:57.080 --> 13:58.274
I mean, there are kids here.

13:58.360 --> 14:00.271
Come on, Meg.
It's just a summer dress.

14:00.880 --> 14:05.908
It's a very short, very chic,
extremely flattering summer dress.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.672
Yeah, well, it's pornographic.

14:08.280 --> 14:11.317
Oh. Look at Dan pretending
to check his email.

14:12.000 --> 14:16.516
If I find pictures of her ass
on his phone, BJ night is canceled.

14:17.280 --> 14:18.440
So, anyway, there I am,

14:18.520 --> 14:21.193
alone, in the middle
of the Empty Quarter, all by myself,

14:21.440 --> 14:23.874
with no water, dying of thirst.
I'm literally

14:24.440 --> 14:27.000
- writing a goodbye letter to Natalie.
- Oh.

14:27.160 --> 14:29.151
And what do I see
coming up over the horizon?

14:29.240 --> 14:31.629
But the exact same camel...

14:31.720 --> 14:33.836
whose life I saved
three years earlier.

14:33.920 --> 14:35.717
- Exact same one.
- Did he remember you?

14:35.880 --> 14:38.136
No. No, Jeff.
He didn't remember me. He's a camel.

14:39.320 --> 14:41.675
But I was able to ride him
into civilization.

14:41.760 --> 14:44.480
And I filed my story, with 15 minutes
to spare, thank you very much.

14:44.560 --> 14:45.696
Caught the next flight to Marrakesh

14:45.720 --> 14:48.712
and was sitting in a café with Natalie
smoking hookah later that night.

14:48.800 --> 14:51.394
- No way!
- I wanna smoke a hookah in Marrakesh.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.150
Well, Stacey,
I know it sounds very romantic.

14:54.240 --> 14:57.994
But, trust me, the world can be
a very dark and disturbing place.

14:58.520 --> 14:59.616
Tim, you want a beer?

14:59.640 --> 15:00.993
Uh, sure. Yeah. Thank you.

15:01.520 --> 15:03.280
- Here you go.
- Ooh. There it is.

15:07.120 --> 15:08.120
Mmm.

15:08.760 --> 15:12.469
Wow, good job... Ooh, ooh, ooh!
Buddy, buddy. Yeah, buddy. Wow!

15:12.560 --> 15:14.256
- That is a lot of blood.
- It's fine. It's okay.

15:14.280 --> 15:15.456
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

15:15.480 --> 15:16.549
It's just gushing a bit.

15:16.640 --> 15:17.776
- Just hold on to that.
- Yes.

15:17.800 --> 15:18.835
Give me this.

15:18.920 --> 15:20.216
- It's sprung a leak.
- Just...

15:20.240 --> 15:22.376
- I feel a little bit light-headed.
- Close your hand around it.

15:22.400 --> 15:23.960
- If I could just maybe...
- No! No! no!

15:24.160 --> 15:25.388
You can't rattle me.

15:26.160 --> 15:28.799
Witness... Witness my destiny.

15:30.560 --> 15:33.552
Neighborhood champ,
five years in a row!

15:35.240 --> 15:37.037
Hey! You wanna give it a try?

15:37.120 --> 15:38.155
- Me?
- Yeah!

15:38.640 --> 15:39.675
No,

15:39.760 --> 15:41.376
- I'll only embarrass myself.
- "No" is not an answer.

15:41.400 --> 15:42.435
Come on. It's so easy.

15:42.680 --> 15:43.908
- It's a bad idea.
- Look,

15:44.000 --> 15:47.197
I'll even show you
the famous Craverston grip, okay?

15:47.280 --> 15:48.793
- All right.
- Put that in your hand.

15:48.880 --> 15:50.598
Now hold it like a pencil.

15:50.720 --> 15:52.278
Now cock your wrist.

15:52.360 --> 15:53.952
- Right.
- Good, good. Elbow out.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.519
And then you just kinda throw at it.

15:55.640 --> 15:56.640
Like this?

15:57.880 --> 15:59.199
This is good?

15:59.280 --> 16:01.840
Well, you kinda throw like a girl.

16:01.920 --> 16:04.798
But when a girl is as beautiful as you
she doesn't have to be good.

16:07.400 --> 16:10.437
Do you mind if I skip
the Craverston grip?

16:10.640 --> 16:12.039
Okay, good luck.

16:26.120 --> 16:28.953
Oh, my God! Look at that!

16:30.480 --> 16:33.153
Maybe I should show you
how to throw like a girl.

16:40.560 --> 16:42.118
Suck on that, Craverston.

16:42.200 --> 16:43.553
Shut up, Oren.

16:44.240 --> 16:45.275
Where's your girlfriend?

17:02.040 --> 17:03.359
Tim.

17:03.440 --> 17:05.635
Oh, hey, Karen.
I was just looking for the bathroom.

17:06.760 --> 17:08.318
You were in Jeff's den.

17:08.400 --> 17:10.117
Yeah. I must've made a wrong turn.

17:10.280 --> 17:11.280
Um...

17:12.160 --> 17:14.560
Lovely place you have here,
by the way. You have a great eye.

17:14.720 --> 17:15.720
Thank you.

17:15.800 --> 17:17.215
Was that your design work
I saw downstairs?

17:17.240 --> 17:19.878
Jeff had mentioned something
about, uh, urinals.

17:20.040 --> 17:22.429
Yes. Oh, well,
the customer's always right.

17:22.560 --> 17:24.560
But, yeah, they are my drawings.

17:24.640 --> 17:26.631
Customer's always right.
Except when they're not.

17:27.839 --> 17:30.280
- Oh, the bathroom's that way, Tim.
- No, thank you, I'm fine.

17:45.760 --> 17:47.910
That was one of
the best Junetoberfests

17:48.160 --> 17:50.196
we have ever, ever had.

17:51.200 --> 17:53.395
Have you ever seen a couple
move into a neighborhood

17:53.480 --> 17:54.959
so nicely as the Joneses?

17:55.920 --> 17:58.275
You don't you think there's
something off about them?

17:58.440 --> 17:59.793
I mean, they're so overly

17:59.880 --> 18:03.998
accomplished, and stylish
and affectionate with one another.

18:04.200 --> 18:05.200
Uh...

18:05.280 --> 18:06.456
Why would they wanna live here?

18:06.480 --> 18:08.516
Karen, they told you,
they wanna settle down.

18:09.560 --> 18:11.080
You know that he was
in your den today?

18:11.120 --> 18:12.155
Yeah, so?

18:12.240 --> 18:15.596
So, he can navigate
the bazaars of Marrakesh,

18:15.680 --> 18:18.956
but he gets "lost upstairs"
looking for a bathroom?

18:19.040 --> 18:20.816
Karen, let me tell you something
I learned years ago.

18:20.840 --> 18:24.037
When people have to poop,
they get embarrassed.

18:24.360 --> 18:26.351
As do I, sometimes.

18:26.600 --> 18:28.511
Really? You think he had to poop?

18:28.720 --> 18:30.039
Probably, yes.

18:30.600 --> 18:33.990
You know, if the Joneses seem a little
bit more affectionate than we do,

18:34.080 --> 18:37.072
it's because they haven't had to mute
their passions the way we have

18:37.160 --> 18:38.718
'cause the kids have been around.

18:38.800 --> 18:42.236
But now, it's our time.
It's our summer. Watch my hand there.

18:42.320 --> 18:46.029
And I think it's time
to get busy sexually.

18:47.560 --> 18:48.976
No. It tickles, honey. Honey!

18:49.000 --> 18:50.416
- Honey, I know we said every second...
- Come on!

18:50.440 --> 18:51.696
Look at the time. Look how late it is.

18:51.720 --> 18:54.393
It's traditional Gaffney foreplay.
Let me just do it.

18:54.480 --> 18:55.595
Come on, baby. Come on.

18:56.600 --> 18:58.431
I'm so tired. But I pick up on things.

18:58.520 --> 19:00.351
I was the one who noticed
when the McNultys

19:00.440 --> 19:02.431
were pirating the Yamamotos' cable.

19:03.720 --> 19:07.395
Yes, and intuition
is a wonderful thing.

19:07.800 --> 19:10.473
And take it from me,
somebody who has had 16 years

19:11.280 --> 19:13.840
of human resource experience,

19:13.920 --> 19:18.630
that the Joneses are perfectly nice,
normal, everyday people.

19:27.720 --> 19:29.760
I didn't know what to do.

19:29.840 --> 19:33.879
Smoke blows from the car, you know?
Uh... So I figured

19:33.960 --> 19:37.669
Americans are really good with car...
Oh! You strong man!

19:38.840 --> 19:39.989
So you can help me out?

19:40.080 --> 19:43.197
Absolutely.
You came to the right guys.

19:43.280 --> 19:45.271
We Americans are good
at a lot of things.

21:28.520 --> 21:29.589
Jeff.

21:34.200 --> 21:35.200
Jeff, wake up.

22:10.840 --> 22:13.195
Who are you, Tim Jones?

22:35.760 --> 22:36.795
Sorry.

22:37.680 --> 22:38.999
Neighbor!

22:39.080 --> 22:40.911
- Hey, Jeff. This...
- Oh, my goodness.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.353
This is embarrassing.

22:42.440 --> 22:44.829
Well, it happens.
Jeepers, let me help you.

22:45.360 --> 22:46.395
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

22:46.480 --> 22:47.959
What are you doing here?

22:48.040 --> 22:51.350
I found your love
of home brewing contagious.

22:51.440 --> 22:53.271
And I figured I could use a hobby.

22:54.080 --> 22:55.195
Instead of glass blowing?

22:55.880 --> 22:57.472
Right. Besides that. Besides that.

22:57.560 --> 23:00.080
It's a cool hobby, but it's probably
not as manly as you'd like.

23:01.320 --> 23:04.676
Hey, Ed.
Set my friend up here.

23:04.760 --> 23:07.256
He's gonna need some wort chillers,
probably need some fizz drops.

23:07.280 --> 23:08.496
- Give him some yeast.
- You're the expert.

23:08.520 --> 23:10.200
- Yup.
- Don't let that yeast get infected.

23:10.280 --> 23:11.336
- Okay.
- I'm kidding.

23:11.360 --> 23:12.998
It's a joke.
It's a yeast infection joke.

23:13.120 --> 23:16.237
- Expensive hobby.
- It's more of a calling, Tim.

23:17.800 --> 23:20.234
- Hey, are you hungry?
- I'm famished.

23:20.320 --> 23:22.595
- You like Chinese?
- The food?

23:23.600 --> 23:24.828
Yeah.

23:33.920 --> 23:35.239
Come on!

23:49.600 --> 23:50.999
Spy force on.

24:16.400 --> 24:19.312
I am leaving this message
in case anything happens to me.

24:19.400 --> 24:22.836
I'm following Natalie Jones
who I have good reason to believe...

24:22.920 --> 24:24.136
Calling Natalie Jones.

24:24.160 --> 24:25.160
No!

24:26.360 --> 24:29.158
No! No, no, no! Ugh!

24:29.480 --> 24:30.799
Siri!

24:37.720 --> 24:38.789
Thank you.

24:40.320 --> 24:41.753
Have a nice day.

24:51.160 --> 24:52.388
How's the book?

24:53.640 --> 24:54.709
Interesting.

25:23.160 --> 25:25.310
Hi, there! Nice to see you.
Yes, indeed.

25:25.400 --> 25:29.029
That's is my friend, Jeff.
This is Mr. and Mrs. Lu. Okay.

25:29.120 --> 25:30.519
All right, we're gonna go on back.

25:31.240 --> 25:33.800
I know! I feel like I've been
putting on a little too much.

25:33.880 --> 25:37.031
Thank you. Come on
back here, Jeff. Thank you.

25:39.080 --> 25:41.913
I'm doing a little piece on,
sort of, hidden gems around the city.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.400
- Now, that place is good...
- Yeah?

25:43.520 --> 25:45.715
...but this place is great.
Come on, follow me.

25:45.840 --> 25:46.909
Ooh...

25:47.000 --> 25:48.856
It's good to get out of the
cul-de-sac every now and again.

25:48.880 --> 25:49.880
Well, it is, yeah.

25:49.960 --> 25:51.216
- I love my cul-de-sac.
- There he is.

25:51.240 --> 25:52.496
I knew I felt your presence, man!

25:52.520 --> 25:54.056
- What's up, brother?
- How are you, pal?

25:54.080 --> 25:55.080
This is my friend, Jeff.

25:55.160 --> 25:56.296
Jeff, this is Ricky.
He owns the place.

25:56.320 --> 25:57.656
- Hi, Ricky, how are you?
- What's up, Jeff?

25:57.680 --> 25:59.352
You don't have to bow down.
Don't be shy.

25:59.920 --> 26:01.280
Come on in, man. This guy's stiff!

26:03.240 --> 26:04.992
Welcome to the Cobra Club.

26:09.120 --> 26:10.917
Well, now,
this is Jeff's first time. So...

26:11.000 --> 26:13.639
Don't worry. We'll take
good care of him, man.

26:13.720 --> 26:14.800
Where do you want us?

26:14.880 --> 26:17.296
- Right there, man.
- Thank you. I'll take a shéjiû.

26:17.320 --> 26:18.514
- One?
- Yup.

26:18.600 --> 26:19.715
- Yeah. Two.
- Two?

26:19.800 --> 26:22.155
- Whatever he's having.
- Two shéjiûs coming up.

26:23.240 --> 26:25.515
So? A little different
than you were expecting?

26:25.600 --> 26:28.239
I gotta tell you. Spice and I
don't sit very well together.

26:28.320 --> 26:31.869
There's certain ramifications the next
day, you know, toilet-wise, but...

26:33.040 --> 26:34.268
This is not that.

26:34.360 --> 26:36.749
Okay? It's not spicy,
but this is the real stuff.

26:36.840 --> 26:37.989
Oh, I'm ready.

26:38.080 --> 26:39.816
Actually, it reminds me
of when I went kayaking

26:39.840 --> 26:42.035
down the Pearl River to Zhongshan.

26:42.160 --> 26:44.754
It's just beautiful. A lot of places,

26:44.840 --> 26:46.159
just like this.

26:46.240 --> 26:48.276
You have a fascinating job.

26:48.360 --> 26:50.920
- Come on. So do you, Jeff.
- Yes.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.592
I'm sure you could
tell me some stories.

26:53.160 --> 26:55.310
I could tell you some stories
to make your skin crawl.

26:55.840 --> 26:57.193
But I'm in HR.

26:57.280 --> 26:59.176
There's a certain wall
of secrecy around me, so...

26:59.200 --> 27:00.997
You could tell me,
but you'd have to kill me.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.696
I'd probably just get in trouble
from corporate.

27:04.720 --> 27:06.995
You wouldn't actually kill me.
It's just an expression.

27:07.080 --> 27:08.991
Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

27:09.080 --> 27:10.832
- Here we go. All right.
- Okay.

27:10.920 --> 27:13.195
Look at all these
little ethnic condiments.

27:13.280 --> 27:14.633
- So cool.
- That is...

27:14.720 --> 27:16.312
- Soy sauce.
- Soy sauce.

27:16.400 --> 27:17.719
Try this. Mmm...

27:18.360 --> 27:19.429
Okay.

27:21.240 --> 27:22.240
Mmm...

27:22.320 --> 27:23.719
Wow! That's good!

27:24.520 --> 27:26.317
What is that? That looks like a snake.

27:26.400 --> 27:27.515
Shéjiû, man.

27:27.600 --> 27:28.874
Snake wine.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.069
That's real cobra.

27:30.840 --> 27:32.558
The alcohol neutralizes
most of the venom.

27:32.640 --> 27:34.278
Yeah, in Guangdong,
old dudes say

27:34.360 --> 27:37.352
you drink snake wine,
makes your sack hang real low, man.

27:37.440 --> 27:38.793
Does it?

27:39.960 --> 27:41.837
Do you have a Arnold Palmer by chance?

27:43.480 --> 27:45.056
You guys want to hear
about tonight's offering?

27:45.080 --> 27:47.310
Yes. Show us what you got. Thank you.

27:48.920 --> 27:50.797
Where did you find this place? Yelp?

27:51.320 --> 27:52.958
It's my job to find places like this.

27:53.040 --> 27:56.077
I talk to people, I go places.
And when I find a place that I like,

27:56.160 --> 27:57.680
I like to share it with people I like.

27:57.760 --> 28:00.320
Shéjiû! Okay, that's a live snake!

28:00.400 --> 28:02.072
Yes, Jeff. It's a snake restaurant.

28:02.200 --> 28:04.839
Yeah, but Panda Express,
they don't serve panda.

28:06.160 --> 28:07.309
Do they?

28:07.400 --> 28:09.595
They call this "the 100-pace viper,"

28:09.680 --> 28:12.478
because if it bites you, that's how
far you're gonna get, man.

28:12.560 --> 28:13.959
- Is that true?
- No!

28:14.040 --> 28:15.553
It's not true.

28:15.640 --> 28:16.960
It's probably closer to 50 paces,

28:17.000 --> 28:18.956
- honestly. It's very potent.
- Pretty bad, man.

28:19.040 --> 28:21.873
I'm afraid of snakes.
I'll eat 'em. But, I'm so sorry.

28:21.960 --> 28:23.896
Ricky knows what he's doing.
He's very good at his job.

28:23.920 --> 28:26.434
Come on, sit down, okay?
Just let him do his thing.

28:26.520 --> 28:27.680
- Yes.
- You're in good hands.

28:27.720 --> 28:29.312
- Yes.
- Okay? Trust me.

28:31.360 --> 28:33.296
You're gonna wanna keep
your hands away from the head,

28:33.320 --> 28:35.880
'cause it can actually still bite you.
So, just be very careful.

28:36.200 --> 28:37.713
Can I have a vegetable spring roll?

28:37.800 --> 28:39.313
Buddy...

28:39.400 --> 28:40.719
You're gonna be just fine. Here.

28:40.800 --> 28:42.074
- A little more of that.
- Yeah.

28:42.160 --> 28:43.280
- Yeah.
- Okay? This is good.

28:48.160 --> 28:50.096
- We might need another bottle of this.
- Yeah.

28:50.120 --> 28:51.997
Let's go ahead and get loosened up.

28:52.080 --> 28:54.116
- Yeah. Snake it up.
- Yeah.

28:59.160 --> 29:02.152
One second. That's Karen. Hello?

29:02.240 --> 29:04.470
Remember I told you something
was off about the Joneses?

29:04.560 --> 29:06.278
Well, my instincts were right.

29:06.520 --> 29:09.080
I just followed Natalie to the mall
and I have two words for you.

29:09.760 --> 29:11.273
Sarah Palin.

29:11.760 --> 29:12.909
And guess what?

29:13.000 --> 29:15.036
There is a Chinese word
for cul-de-sac. It's...

29:16.520 --> 29:18.829
I'm sorry, I'm having
a hard time hearing you.

29:18.920 --> 29:21.639
The point is, the Joneses
are not who they say they are.

29:26.760 --> 29:28.273
Okay. Hold on. I'm sorry.

29:30.440 --> 29:33.796
Karen, I'm-I'm actually,
lunching with, uh, Tim right now.

29:33.880 --> 29:36.519
There's nothing weird
going on whatsoever. I think...

29:38.080 --> 29:40.440
I think you're just sublimating
your anxiety about the kids.

29:40.560 --> 29:42.869
You're having insecurities
about, you know, your career...

29:42.960 --> 29:44.359
Don't even begin to go there!

29:44.920 --> 29:46.256
I don't throw your man crush
in your face.

29:46.280 --> 29:49.352
I don't have a man crush!
I don't have a man crush.

29:49.440 --> 29:52.193
I had it once in my life,
when I was a boy.

29:52.280 --> 29:54.555
- You mean Bruce?
- She likes to be called Caitlyn.

30:20.600 --> 30:22.431
No, no, no,
you're absolutely right.

30:23.880 --> 30:25.757
- Hello, Karen.
- Natalie!

30:26.200 --> 30:27.474
What a surprise!

30:27.880 --> 30:29.871
You've got no clothes on.
You're on the phone.

30:30.120 --> 30:31.712
I'm gonna go.

30:32.840 --> 30:34.398
To be continued.

30:37.640 --> 30:39.437
I was just leaving Tim a voice mail.

30:39.520 --> 30:40.589
Oh...

30:40.680 --> 30:43.148
He likes to hear from me
when I'm trying on lingerie.

30:44.840 --> 30:47.354
I tell him what I'm putting on,
how it looks.

30:49.480 --> 30:50.595
How it makes me feel.

30:51.360 --> 30:52.856
It looks great!
I'm sure he...

30:52.880 --> 30:54.313
I'm sure he's happy to know that.

30:55.120 --> 30:56.176
Tell him from me.

30:56.200 --> 31:00.591
Yeah, it's one of our things.
Keeps the spark alive.

31:00.680 --> 31:02.636
Do you and Jeff
have a thing?

31:02.720 --> 31:05.393
Yes, Jeff and I have a thing.

31:05.640 --> 31:07.039
We...

31:08.040 --> 31:10.918
We do it really fast in case
the kids come running into our room.

31:12.440 --> 31:14.715
Sounds like you're very sexual people.

31:15.360 --> 31:18.670
- But your kids are gone, aren't they?
- Uh, yeah. Yeah.

31:18.760 --> 31:21.911
Time for something new.
Is that why you're buying lingerie?

31:23.000 --> 31:24.479
Yes.

31:24.560 --> 31:26.437
Let's see what you decided on.

31:26.520 --> 31:29.353
No.
I mean, I just... It's just stuff.

31:29.440 --> 31:31.749
Come on. Show me
what you think is sexy.

31:32.040 --> 31:33.439
They're for Jeff's mom.

31:33.680 --> 31:35.796
She's morbidly obese.
She drives around on a scooter.

31:35.880 --> 31:37.400
I feel really bad for...

31:38.520 --> 31:40.078
Let's be real with one another, okay?

31:42.000 --> 31:43.718
And he's dating
Sheila Rondowski,

31:43.800 --> 31:45.995
I think is her name, on the sly,

31:46.080 --> 31:47.896
which is a big no-no,
'cause she's his superior.

31:47.920 --> 31:48.955
Sure.

31:49.040 --> 31:50.758
This stuff is so good, Tim.
It's delicious.

31:50.840 --> 31:52.512
- Didn't I tell you?
- Mmm-m.

31:52.600 --> 31:56.115
I tell ya... Listen. It is impressive
how people open up to you.

31:56.200 --> 31:58.236
- They tell you a lot.
- They do.

31:58.320 --> 31:59.616
It sounds like they complain
a lot, but...

31:59.640 --> 32:02.916
Oh, gosh! It comes with the territory.
I'm fine with it. But, yes.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.149
Let me ask you this.

32:04.240 --> 32:07.755
Does anybody ever say
to you in confidence

32:08.520 --> 32:09.794
how much they hate the company?

32:09.880 --> 32:11.632
Ricky, let's get some more wine!

32:11.720 --> 32:13.631
Hold a grudge? Anything like that?

32:13.720 --> 32:16.712
Sara Patel, she has
irritable bowel syndro...

32:16.800 --> 32:18.950
Excuse me. She has
irritable bowel syndrome.

32:19.080 --> 32:21.514
There's a lot of co-workers,
too, that sit near the bathroom.

32:21.600 --> 32:23.640
Sometimes, we're all irritated
by your bowels, Sara.

32:23.720 --> 32:25.358
Everybody on the fourth floor knows.

32:25.440 --> 32:26.656
But that's not what I'm talking about.

32:26.680 --> 32:28.511
Is there ever a situation
where somebody seems

32:28.600 --> 32:30.113
like they came into a lot of money,

32:30.200 --> 32:32.555
or they, you know,
they bought a new car or new clothes?

32:32.640 --> 32:34.136
- Looks like they won the lottery?
- Yes.

32:34.160 --> 32:35.388
- Or hit the jackpot?
- Yeah.

32:35.480 --> 32:37.596
- Yeah? Who's that?
- Sanjay. He bought a Grillbot.

32:37.680 --> 32:38.749
What's that?

32:41.760 --> 32:43.216
That's the guy I work with.
His name's Sanjay.

32:43.240 --> 32:45.913
No, I know what Sanjay is.
What's a Grillbot?

32:46.000 --> 32:48.594
Oh, grillbot is like... It's just a...

32:48.680 --> 32:51.752
It's just a... What it is, is a robot
that cleans your barbecue grill.

32:51.840 --> 32:53.831
You just put it in your grill,
you shut the lid,

32:53.920 --> 32:57.469
and it just kind of ruminates in there
and gets all the little coal pieces,

32:57.560 --> 33:00.313
the little icky pieces up.
And it's, you know, spick and span!

33:00.400 --> 33:02.080
It's like a Roomba for your grill.

33:02.840 --> 33:06.310
I'm thinking more of like the...
Like, like... More expensive.

33:06.400 --> 33:08.960
These are $99, Tim. Expensive stuff.

33:09.040 --> 33:10.268
Right.

33:10.360 --> 33:12.576
But you gotta make sure the grill's
off. Sanjay didn't do that.

33:12.600 --> 33:14.477
Are we done talking
about the Grillbot?

33:14.560 --> 33:16.136
If you're not gonna eat this,
I'm gonna eat this.

33:16.160 --> 33:17.991
No, no, no, go ahead.
Take what you like.

33:18.080 --> 33:19.274
The thing is,

33:19.360 --> 33:22.716
is he voided the warranty
on the Grillbot and the grill.

33:23.720 --> 33:26.109
Jesus, Jeff! Ricky!

33:26.200 --> 33:27.679
Oh, God! Put it down. Ricky!

33:27.760 --> 33:29.512
Oh, man! I've never seen that before.

33:29.600 --> 33:30.749
Go find the shot!

33:30.840 --> 33:32.034
The antivenom. Go get it!

33:32.120 --> 33:33.235
Hey, little buddy!

33:33.320 --> 33:36.039
Oh, my God. No, no, no, no.
No, no. Hey.

33:36.120 --> 33:37.155
He's snacking on my hand.

33:37.240 --> 33:38.719
Look at me! Look at me! Look at me!

33:38.800 --> 33:39.949
All right. Get it out!

33:40.080 --> 33:41.800
We're all gonna
have to have a relationship.

33:42.760 --> 33:45.957
Hold on. We're gonna get the antivenom
okay, Jeff? Hold on a second.

33:46.040 --> 33:47.951
You got it? All right.
Hold on, hold on.

33:50.080 --> 33:51.136
- How does that feel, buddy?
- Huh?

33:51.160 --> 33:52.388
How does that feel?

33:54.720 --> 33:56.312
That's good.

33:57.120 --> 33:59.111
Now this would be incredible on you.

33:59.200 --> 34:00.633
Perfect, I'll take it.

34:01.280 --> 34:03.191
You're not being fun, Karen.

34:03.280 --> 34:07.796
I want you to forget everything you
heard about functional breast support.

34:09.400 --> 34:10.719
Why are you so nervous?

34:11.639 --> 34:12.639
Hmm?

34:13.639 --> 34:16.552
Is it because we're two women
trying on lingerie together?

34:18.600 --> 34:21.114
Or because I know
you were following me today?

34:21.199 --> 34:23.589
I wasn't following. What? No! No!

34:23.679 --> 34:26.335
I was at the mall. I was shopping.
I wonder if they have this in yellow.

34:26.360 --> 34:28.793
- Jeff's favorite color is yellow.
- I'm not stupid, Karen.

34:29.440 --> 34:30.554
You're right to follow me.

34:32.040 --> 34:34.918
To be thinking that this woman
is not who she pretends to be.

34:36.520 --> 34:38.272
Because I'm hiding something.

34:39.080 --> 34:40.228
You are?

34:41.639 --> 34:42.675
So are you.

34:42.840 --> 34:46.310
We're so alike, you and I.

34:46.480 --> 34:51.235
Two strong, sexually vibrant women.
And yet, here we are.

34:51.320 --> 34:55.074
Forced to bury our true selves
from the Meg Craverstons of the world.

34:55.159 --> 34:56.956
What's Meg got to do with this?

34:57.040 --> 34:58.268
Oh, come on, Karen.

34:58.360 --> 35:01.079
I hear the way she talks about me
when she thinks I'm not looking.

35:01.200 --> 35:02.997
Hating me for the way I look,

35:03.240 --> 35:07.597
as if perfect bone structure and
flawless skin is something I can help!

35:09.160 --> 35:12.277
I may not need to moisturize,
but I still have feelings.

35:13.320 --> 35:15.959
I didn't know about the feelings.

35:16.960 --> 35:19.520
That's why women like us
need to stick together.

35:19.600 --> 35:21.431
Not follow each other in malls.

35:22.640 --> 35:23.914
Do you Kegel?

35:24.400 --> 35:25.594
- Kegel?
- Mmm-hmm.

35:25.680 --> 35:27.830
You mean the exercises
for the lady parts?

35:28.000 --> 35:30.434
Strength has to start somewhere.

35:30.520 --> 35:32.511
Not... I don't.

35:34.560 --> 35:36.596
In fact, I'm doing some right now.

35:39.360 --> 35:42.830
I could crack a walnut down there,
if I needed to.

35:43.640 --> 35:44.914
Have you ever had any need to?

35:45.000 --> 35:46.000
Now you go.

35:47.720 --> 35:50.359
- I couldn't crack anything down there.
- Are we still hiding?

35:50.880 --> 35:54.156
Come on, Karen.
Just... channel your power.

35:54.320 --> 35:55.719
Okay. I'll do it. I'll try.

36:01.440 --> 36:04.193
I did it! I felt it!

36:04.480 --> 36:05.754
How was that?

36:06.320 --> 36:07.469
Work in progress.

36:07.600 --> 36:09.716
Now, you have a choice.

36:12.560 --> 36:13.993
Which Karen do you wanna be?

36:15.240 --> 36:16.639
Karen, the meek?

36:19.640 --> 36:21.119
Or Karen, the strong?

36:23.640 --> 36:25.471
- Sure you're okay?
- I'm okay. Yeah.

36:26.760 --> 36:27.875
You saved my life.

36:29.360 --> 36:30.713
And that was some good snake.

36:32.440 --> 36:34.032
I'm embarrassed though.

36:34.800 --> 36:36.233
Little drunk.

36:36.320 --> 36:38.390
You had me worried there for a second.

36:38.480 --> 36:40.311
Get yourself cleaned up.
I'll get the check.

36:40.960 --> 36:42.359
I know what you're doing, Tim.

36:44.360 --> 36:46.032
What am I doing, Jeff?

36:46.120 --> 36:48.031
I read people for a living.
That's what I do.

36:49.040 --> 36:51.873
And, you know, you get me drunk
on snake wine

36:51.960 --> 36:54.030
and get me to open up
and tell you secrets.

36:55.760 --> 36:56.909
You...

36:58.680 --> 37:00.591
are trying to make a friend.

37:03.360 --> 37:04.520
I got a lot of friends, Jeff.

37:04.600 --> 37:07.319
Yeah, but you have a lot
of secrets locked inside of you.

37:07.920 --> 37:10.912
I think that's why you might be one
of the loneliest guys I've ever met.

37:13.240 --> 37:15.800
Now, what do you have
to say about that?

37:17.680 --> 37:19.159
You wanna know something about me?

37:23.760 --> 37:26.069
Sometimes I hate what I do
for a living.

37:28.440 --> 37:30.237
But doesn't that feel good?

37:30.320 --> 37:32.151
To express yourself?

37:38.920 --> 37:41.514
- Is this us bonding now?
- No, this is us talking.

37:41.600 --> 37:43.397
You want bonding?
I'll show you bonding.

37:44.080 --> 37:46.355
You're gonna look at me.
I'm gonna button you up.

37:46.480 --> 37:49.278
Okay. Okay. That's loud.

37:55.160 --> 37:56.160
Whoa!

37:59.000 --> 38:00.672
Jesus, you do this for fun?

38:00.760 --> 38:02.398
I got you, okay?

38:14.880 --> 38:16.632
Isn't this a blast?

38:16.720 --> 38:17.835
Yeah!

38:40.800 --> 38:43.394
- Hey, Karen! Karen?
- Hey, I'm here!

38:43.480 --> 38:45.675
Hi, Karen. How are you?
I brought you some flowers.

38:45.800 --> 38:47.358
Oh, thank you, honey!

38:47.440 --> 38:49.351
You're not gonna believe
the day that I had.

38:49.440 --> 38:51.795
Guess who likes being
a man-bird as much as I do?

38:51.880 --> 38:53.029
- Who?
- Tim Jones.

38:53.120 --> 38:54.616
Look at that. Why are you wearing
a robe? Are you sick?

38:54.640 --> 38:56.437
Oh, nice. Honey,

38:56.560 --> 38:58.680
I'm just thinking.
What am I really doing this summer?

38:58.760 --> 39:02.753
I mean, I sent the kids away to camp,
I'm redesigning bathrooms.

39:02.840 --> 39:04.319
Is that what makes me happy?

39:04.400 --> 39:06.914
Is that what makes me,
Karen Gaffney, complete?

39:07.560 --> 39:10.552
Okay, well, listen,
if you wanna feel complete,

39:10.640 --> 39:12.710
there's some exercises
I do at work with the guys...

39:12.800 --> 39:14.791
Honey, no. They don't work.

39:14.880 --> 39:17.872
Now, I've lost touch
with the real Karen.

39:18.520 --> 39:21.239
And then these amazing
new neighbors move in

39:21.320 --> 39:23.629
and with me feeling so vulnerable,
it's only natural

39:23.720 --> 39:26.314
that I would get suspicious
and find fault with them.

39:26.400 --> 39:31.076
But really, I just feel like
I should be focusing on me.

39:31.160 --> 39:32.434
And on us.

39:36.440 --> 39:38.136
Sweet baby Jesus,
what's happening?

39:38.160 --> 39:40.799
Natalie said we needed a thing
to keep our spark alive.

39:40.880 --> 39:42.496
You've been talking to Natalie
about us sexually?

39:42.520 --> 39:44.954
No, obviously.
I didn't tell her anything, honey.

39:45.040 --> 39:47.474
No, I just mean
she's unusually intuitive.

39:47.560 --> 39:48.675
- For a Greek.
- Right.

39:48.760 --> 39:50.591
And she just thinks
that once you're married

39:50.680 --> 39:52.840
at a certain point,
you have to make more of an effort.

39:52.920 --> 39:55.354
This is the Karen that I...
This is the Karen that I love.

39:55.440 --> 39:57.510
I really do. Take me.

39:57.600 --> 39:59.352
Take me, darling.

40:00.360 --> 40:01.429
Okay.

40:02.600 --> 40:03.600
Oh!

40:04.920 --> 40:06.399
Shoot, honey.

40:07.960 --> 40:09.678
It was the conversation piece.

40:10.600 --> 40:11.635
Don't worry about it.

40:12.480 --> 40:13.480
Oh...

40:16.760 --> 40:17.829
What is that?

40:17.920 --> 40:19.592
I don't know. It doesn't matter.
Come on.

40:19.680 --> 40:20.999
It's okay. It doesn't matter.

40:21.240 --> 40:24.198
You know what, honey?
We need to go back to our lovemaking.

40:24.280 --> 40:25.554
- Where were we?
- Yeah, okay.

40:25.640 --> 40:28.240
- It's so hot! It's so hot!
- Yeah. Okay, I... Should I grope you?

40:29.200 --> 40:30.269
- Great!
- Yeah.

40:30.360 --> 40:32.715
Let's go back. Oh, Jeff, Jeff!

40:32.800 --> 40:35.678
- It's so hot!
- So, you are sick?

40:35.760 --> 40:37.955
You know what?
I'll tell you what we should do.

40:38.080 --> 40:40.640
We should put on a soundtrack
for our passion.

40:40.720 --> 40:43.280
You want a little passion music?
This calls for The Judds.

40:43.360 --> 40:44.920
- We're gonna put on some music.
- Okay.

40:45.680 --> 40:47.656
I'm going to put the wine glasses
in the dishwasher.

40:47.680 --> 40:49.477
Right. Okay, so you got...
You wanna narrate!

40:49.560 --> 40:51.039
Okay. All right. I got you. So...

40:51.120 --> 40:53.076
And then... This is so much fun!

40:54.440 --> 40:56.715
The blood leaves Jeff's head

40:56.800 --> 40:59.109
and slowly makes its way
to his midsection.

40:59.760 --> 41:00.976
I don't know why we're in the closet.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.216
- It seems very un-erotic to me.
- Honey, listen!

41:02.240 --> 41:04.117
Listen! Because
our neighbors bugged us!

41:04.200 --> 41:06.156
Told you something
was wrong with them.

41:06.240 --> 41:08.595
Makes a little more sense
what Tim was doing in your den.

41:08.680 --> 41:09.856
And do not tell me
that he had to poop.

41:09.880 --> 41:12.155
He did not have to go number two.

41:12.280 --> 41:14.760
And now I know
what Natalie was doing at the café.

41:15.360 --> 41:16.554
It was a drop!

41:16.640 --> 41:18.551
A drop? What are you talking about?

41:18.640 --> 41:20.256
I can't believe she duped me
into this lingerie.

41:20.280 --> 41:22.376
But she was in her underwear
and I was in my underwear and...

41:22.400 --> 41:24.960
Oh, my God! She was so persuasive.

41:25.040 --> 41:26.856
Wait. You were both in your
underwear at the same time?

41:26.880 --> 41:28.696
Get your mind out of the gutter!
It was a charade!

41:28.720 --> 41:31.871
Okay, Karen, I just wanna make sure
this isn't another case of paranoia.

41:31.960 --> 41:33.816
Remember the time you made me sleep in
the car 'cause I ate that hot pepper

41:33.840 --> 41:35.120
and you thought I was possessed?

41:35.200 --> 41:37.496
Your eyes were all red. You were
trying to have sex on a school night.

41:37.520 --> 41:39.875
I know, but it was just the jalapeeno.
That's my point.

41:39.960 --> 41:41.712
God! We gotta call the cops!

41:41.800 --> 41:43.856
Call the cops and tell them what?
Our neighbors bugged the house?

41:43.880 --> 41:45.154
- Yes!
- That sounds crazy!

41:45.240 --> 41:46.912
What happens when
we really need the cops?

41:47.000 --> 41:48.433
They won't come to our house. Why?

41:48.520 --> 41:50.750
Because we're on some kind
of crazy list. That's crazy.

41:50.840 --> 41:52.353
You're right. We need more evidence.

41:53.360 --> 41:56.432
- And it's a jalapeño.
- Karen. Karen!

41:59.040 --> 42:00.109
Karen!

42:01.720 --> 42:04.029
Kar... Karen, look.

42:04.120 --> 42:05.792
I know that you miss
Mikey and Patrick,

42:05.880 --> 42:07.518
but parents weekend
is not for two weeks.

42:07.600 --> 42:08.600
Get down!

42:08.680 --> 42:10.496
Parents weekend
isn't for two weeks.

42:10.520 --> 42:13.080
Maybe we can do some
breathing exercises to center you.

42:13.160 --> 42:16.709
Jeff, I don't need to do any deep
breathing exercises! I'm centered!

42:17.240 --> 42:18.840
It's quiet over there.

42:19.120 --> 42:20.394
It's too quiet.

42:22.080 --> 42:23.832
They're probably watching us,
watching them.

42:23.920 --> 42:27.151
They're not watching us! They're at
a restaurant with Stacey Chung.

42:27.920 --> 42:28.989
How do you know that?

42:29.080 --> 42:31.548
Because we talked about it
at the indoor skydiving place!

42:31.640 --> 42:33.153
Why didn't you tell me?

42:33.240 --> 42:34.878
Karen, stop!

42:34.960 --> 42:37.235
Darling, stop, please!
Think about what you're doing.

42:37.320 --> 42:38.536
You'll go to jail
for something like this.

42:38.560 --> 42:39.754
Only if I get caught.

42:39.840 --> 42:41.558
See? No fingerprints.

42:41.640 --> 42:43.870
Now, people move in,
they always change the locks,

42:43.960 --> 42:46.030
but they never change
the garage remote.

42:46.120 --> 42:48.656
I forgot to give it back when Bridget
and Dave went to Myrtle Beach

42:48.680 --> 42:49.829
and asked me to feed Smokey.

42:55.560 --> 42:58.393
Are you coming?
You're gonna need to cover your hands.

42:58.480 --> 43:00.277
Cover my hands? With what?

43:00.360 --> 43:01.475
Use your socks.

43:03.640 --> 43:05.915
Oh, God! It looks like a show home.

43:07.360 --> 43:10.432
- They painted over Bridget's mural.
- That's a real tragedy.

43:11.880 --> 43:14.075
Look, there's nothing weird here.
Let's go, let's go!

43:16.160 --> 43:18.833
Karen! There are windows
everywhere. Get down! Get down!

43:19.840 --> 43:20.989
So weird.

43:22.400 --> 43:23.440
Stand up!

43:26.160 --> 43:28.390
These pots have never seen
a lick of flame.

43:28.480 --> 43:30.630
Little weird for someone
with a cooking blog, huh?

43:30.720 --> 43:33.553
Well, it's a new house,
new pots. It makes sense to me.

43:33.640 --> 43:36.632
And an empty spice rack. She wows
the neighbors with her appetizers.

43:36.720 --> 43:37.789
No spices.

43:37.880 --> 43:40.269
Never judge a woman
by her spice rack, Karen.

43:40.360 --> 43:41.998
Check for stuff about
Sri Lankan orphans.

43:42.080 --> 43:43.752
I bet that's another web of lies!

43:49.640 --> 43:52.234
Sorry, Tim, for breaking
into your house.

43:52.320 --> 43:54.072
I just wanted to be your friend.

43:54.160 --> 43:55.656
This certainly isn't
a friendly gesture.

43:55.680 --> 43:57.591
You know what, honey? I can hear you.

43:57.680 --> 43:59.616
And it hurts my feelings
when you're not supportive.

43:59.640 --> 44:01.312
Karen, this is ridiculous!

44:02.080 --> 44:03.957
It's gotta be here somewhere.

44:06.760 --> 44:08.751
Karen! Karen, Karen, Karen!

44:09.680 --> 44:11.557
Look at them. So perfect.

44:19.840 --> 44:20.875
Karen, come on, let's go.

44:21.520 --> 44:22.714
Look at this.

44:22.800 --> 44:24.631
Okay. So, they're gamers.
Let's go.

44:31.520 --> 44:33.431
Karen! Don't! What are you doing?

44:34.720 --> 44:37.029
Stacey Chung.
Isn't she out with the Joneses?

44:37.120 --> 44:38.120
Yeah.

44:39.040 --> 44:40.075
Ted Wallace.

44:40.160 --> 44:41.639
He works with you, right?

44:41.720 --> 44:44.757
Yeah. Maybe it's just some
kind of social media thing.

44:44.840 --> 44:46.193
Dhameer Mustafa?

44:46.280 --> 44:47.793
There's Dan.

44:48.280 --> 44:49.280
Sanjay.

44:57.280 --> 44:59.157
Oh, God! They're targeting MBI.

45:00.800 --> 45:02.119
There's some kind of missile.

45:02.200 --> 45:04.016
These are all the people
he was asking me about.

45:04.040 --> 45:06.156
Oh, my God! I told him everything.

45:06.240 --> 45:07.719
- Oh, God.
- We've gotta go.

45:07.800 --> 45:08.856
Switch down the computer, honey.

45:08.880 --> 45:10.438
We gotta get out of here.

45:10.560 --> 45:13.199
I can't get any purchase on the mouse
because I have a sock hand.

45:13.280 --> 45:14.456
- Okay, hold on.
- Switch it off! Put it back.

45:14.480 --> 45:16.056
- Karen...
- Put it back the...

45:16.080 --> 45:18.196
No! You don't understand!
They're spies.

45:18.280 --> 45:20.776
- Karen, please, okay? Just shh!
- We gotta go right now!

45:20.800 --> 45:21.936
I need to write
these names down.

45:21.960 --> 45:23.279
What are you doing? We gotta go!

45:23.360 --> 45:25.828
They could be back at any second.

45:25.920 --> 45:26.920
What are you staring at?

45:27.680 --> 45:28.829
What is that? A pen?

45:28.920 --> 45:29.955
What?

45:30.920 --> 45:32.399
- What?
- You have a...

45:35.520 --> 45:37.476
Oh, God! Oh, my God! Now what?

45:37.560 --> 45:38.879
Oh, shit, I killed her.

45:38.960 --> 45:40.234
Karen!

45:40.920 --> 45:42.239
Karen!

45:42.320 --> 45:43.355
Oh, thank God!

45:43.440 --> 45:44.589
Honey.

45:47.760 --> 45:49.671
Okay, we gotta go. Karen, wake up!

45:58.920 --> 45:59.955
Oh, God.

46:00.480 --> 46:02.869
Okay. Okay. Damn!

46:07.640 --> 46:09.039
Sorry. Sorry.

46:09.160 --> 46:11.515
- You're welcome, baby.
- Okay.

46:14.040 --> 46:16.554
- You're so cute!
- Karen, shh!

46:17.720 --> 46:19.551
Okay. Okay.

46:19.640 --> 46:22.996
Why are you shushing me?
They haven't any dogs.

46:28.200 --> 46:31.590
I thought Chili's
was supposed to be fancy.

46:31.680 --> 46:33.636
Yeah, I don't think you ordered well.

46:35.960 --> 46:37.837
Whee!
Remember when we were in college,

46:37.920 --> 46:41.356
and your parents, they almost caught
us in the bushes, and we hid!

46:41.440 --> 46:43.032
Yeah.

46:43.120 --> 46:44.633
Wait, I met you after college.

46:46.240 --> 46:48.276
Oh, my God!

46:48.360 --> 46:49.952
It's almost like our wedding night.

46:50.040 --> 46:51.951
Why did we do that?
What are we doing?

46:52.040 --> 46:53.075
What do we do?

46:53.160 --> 46:54.878
Jeff, you're being so serious!

46:56.080 --> 46:58.992
- I'm Jeff. I'm so serious.
- Karen, Karen, Karen!

46:59.840 --> 47:01.800
- Why are you being so serious?
- Okay.

47:03.000 --> 47:04.115
- Stop licking me!
- Yeah.

47:04.200 --> 47:05.428
Okay, listen. Oh, shit!

47:06.480 --> 47:07.629
Shit.

47:08.720 --> 47:10.199
- I'm getting on top!
- I...

47:10.280 --> 47:11.315
I'm getting on top.

47:11.400 --> 47:13.016
- Karen! Karen! Karen!
- I'm on top!

47:13.040 --> 47:14.917
That makes me feel weird.
Karen, please.

47:15.000 --> 47:16.831
I'm not into this right now,
sweetheart.

47:16.920 --> 47:18.638
I'm not really into this.

47:19.360 --> 47:21.720
- Cuddle me.
- No cuddling! Our neighbors are spies!

47:21.760 --> 47:24.200
- Our neighbors are spies.
- I wanna cuddle. Cuddle me.

47:24.240 --> 47:26.151
Look at them up there.

47:26.280 --> 47:29.590
Probably going upstairs to make sex,
and they won't even think about us.

47:31.040 --> 47:33.156
You broke my heart, Tim Jones.

47:35.000 --> 47:36.558
You broke my heart.

47:37.280 --> 47:39.430
I'm just saying,
the place is called Chili's.

47:39.520 --> 47:40.696
- It's a Mexican place.
- I can't believe...

47:40.720 --> 47:42.336
- I don't know why you would...
- ...we're still talking about that.

47:42.360 --> 47:43.713
...order anything remotely Asian.

47:43.800 --> 47:47.315
Okay. I guess we can cross off Stacey.

47:47.400 --> 47:48.958
She's not going to give us anything.

47:49.040 --> 47:51.270
Hey, do you know what a Grillbot is?

47:52.240 --> 47:53.309
What?

47:53.400 --> 47:55.336
It's this thing. Jeff was telling me
about it the other day.

47:55.360 --> 47:58.511
It's this little robot
that cleans your barbecue...

47:58.600 --> 48:00.511
I hope this is not going to be
a problem.

48:01.520 --> 48:02.669
What?

48:07.280 --> 48:11.319
First rule of what we do. Don't get
too close to your targets. Remember?

48:11.400 --> 48:12.549
Actually...

48:12.640 --> 48:16.519
the first rule of what we do, is to
not fall in love with your partner.

48:17.680 --> 48:20.558
Right? Wasn't that the first rule?

48:20.640 --> 48:21.993
Tim Jones.

48:23.560 --> 48:25.710
What am I going to do with you? Hmm?

48:27.240 --> 48:28.958
I don't know.

48:29.040 --> 48:30.320
- You don't know?
- I don't know.

48:30.360 --> 48:32.316
- I have a few ideas.
- I have some ideas too.

48:32.400 --> 48:33.515
You do?

48:33.600 --> 48:36.512
- Mmm-hmm. Should I start now?
- Yes, you should.

48:38.640 --> 48:41.677
Uh... Okay. Okay.

48:50.800 --> 48:52.791
Well, that might be a problem.

49:01.280 --> 49:02.872
Hey, buddy. Can I use your computer?

49:03.000 --> 49:04.991
I need to check
my fantasy baseball roster.

49:05.080 --> 49:06.229
Go ahead. Go ahead.

49:06.320 --> 49:07.514
Thanks.

49:17.200 --> 49:20.033
What is happening?

49:20.120 --> 49:22.634
You okay, Jeff?
You seem kind of distant.

49:22.880 --> 49:24.598
No, I'm fine. I'm just...

49:24.680 --> 49:27.911
sifting through the wreckage
of every value I once held dear.

49:29.320 --> 49:32.073
Good. I was worried
it might be something real.

49:36.440 --> 49:37.555
Hey, Dan.

49:38.920 --> 49:40.399
Dan!

49:49.040 --> 49:51.156
The Joneses aren't
who they say they are.

49:52.000 --> 49:53.080
What are you talking about?

49:54.880 --> 49:55.995
Your phone.

49:56.560 --> 49:58.437
Okay. Okay.

50:02.520 --> 50:03.635
Spies?

50:28.400 --> 50:30.834
But it's not like that,
I swear!

50:30.920 --> 50:33.176
Sometimes she picks up on things.
This time she was right.

50:33.200 --> 50:34.872
You have to take this upstairs, Carl!

50:34.960 --> 50:38.077
This company, my neighborhood,

50:38.160 --> 50:41.789
Western civilization as we know it,
they're all at risk.

50:43.800 --> 50:45.552
And it might be my fault.

50:49.240 --> 50:51.356
All right, Gaffney.
I'll do some digging.

50:51.560 --> 50:52.709
Okay. Thank you.

50:52.800 --> 50:54.552
See what I can learn
about these devices.

50:54.640 --> 50:57.757
And if I find out they're real,
and not from some hobby shop,

50:57.840 --> 51:00.559
- well, you wait for my call.
- Okay.

51:28.720 --> 51:29.755
Go for Jeff.

51:29.840 --> 51:32.308
I gotta say, Gaffney,
you and your wife were right.

51:32.440 --> 51:36.149
You know those devices you gave me?
I was talking to a friend of mine.

51:36.280 --> 51:37.633
Ex-military.

51:37.720 --> 51:40.792
And well, this line is unsecured,
so I can't go into details,

51:40.880 --> 51:44.919
but let me just say,
this stuff is the real shit!

51:45.000 --> 51:48.197
God! Okay. Who are the Joneses
working for? Are they Russian?

51:48.280 --> 51:49.429
Damn it, Gaffney.

51:49.520 --> 51:52.114
What is it about the word
"unsecured" that you don't get?

51:52.200 --> 51:53.680
Look, I'm gonna do some more digging,

51:53.760 --> 51:56.194
and then you meet with me
before work tomorrow.

51:56.280 --> 51:57.679
Okay.

51:57.800 --> 51:59.711
You know the old MBI building? On 75?

51:59.800 --> 52:01.711
7:00 a.m. Just look for the van.

52:01.800 --> 52:02.994
Why are we meeting there?

52:03.080 --> 52:06.550
Well, so we can strategize
before we take it upstairs!

52:06.640 --> 52:08.560
My buddy says the last time
he saw tech like that

52:08.760 --> 52:10.318
was on a dead man.

52:10.400 --> 52:11.600
Dead man? Why would you say...

52:12.800 --> 52:13.915
Jesus!

52:16.080 --> 52:18.116
"Jesus" is right.

52:18.720 --> 52:21.837
Gaffney, this is the big time!
I mean, we are going all the way.

52:21.920 --> 52:24.176
- Not now, Carl. Not now.
- Don't try to give me the brush off.

52:24.200 --> 52:25.896
If you think you're gonna
handle this yourself...

52:25.920 --> 52:28.070
- Okay, okay.
- ...you're making a big mistake!

52:29.040 --> 52:31.679
- Work buddy.
- Gaffney, don't mess this up!

52:31.760 --> 52:33.880
- Carl! Okay, yeah. Good.
- 7:00 a. m. Bring lattes...

52:36.400 --> 52:38.200
You okay there, buddy?
You almost ran me over.

52:38.280 --> 52:40.953
Yeah, I was looking for Bernie.
He keeps pooping

52:41.240 --> 52:43.231
in my yard and I was just...
I mean, his dogs keep

52:43.320 --> 52:46.357
pooping in my yard. I was distracted.

52:46.720 --> 52:47.789
How are you?

52:47.880 --> 52:49.280
You don't seem like yourself, Jeff.

52:49.320 --> 52:50.719
You don't seem like yourself, Tim.

52:50.800 --> 52:52.074
What's that supposed to mean?

52:52.280 --> 52:55.238
I was... You said it to me. I was...
What did you mean when you said it?

52:56.040 --> 52:57.837
We think we had a break-in last night.

52:57.960 --> 53:00.349
- What?
- Yeah. I know. Really rocks your

53:00.440 --> 53:02.112
faith in the notion of trust,
doesn't it?

53:02.560 --> 53:04.437
Tell me about it. My gosh!

53:04.600 --> 53:05.696
You'd think in a neighborhood
like this

53:05.720 --> 53:07.376
you wouldn't have to worry
about something like that.

53:07.400 --> 53:08.879
I'm so sorry about that, Tim.

53:09.880 --> 53:12.519
Yeah, well, Jeff,
here's the thing about trust.

53:13.280 --> 53:17.432
Once it's gone, bad things happen.

53:18.480 --> 53:19.674
I heard that.

53:21.000 --> 53:22.069
Okay, well, I should go.

53:22.160 --> 53:23.752
Karen and I are supposed to
take a bath.

53:40.720 --> 53:43.029
Yeah, a little warning.
Carl can be a bit prickly,

53:43.120 --> 53:45.793
but he's a top notch security man
and he happens to like the way

53:45.880 --> 53:47.871
- your mind thinks, okay?
- Okay.

53:49.000 --> 53:52.390
Is that him in the bathrobe
hanging laundry?

53:53.080 --> 53:55.275
I don't know.
Maybe he's having a yard sale.

53:58.440 --> 54:00.237
Gaffney, right on time!

54:00.400 --> 54:03.073
And you brought the lattes.
Knew I could count on you.

54:03.160 --> 54:05.799
This is my wife Carl.
I mean, this is my wife, Carl.

54:05.880 --> 54:07.029
Nice to meet you.

54:07.120 --> 54:08.216
- Nice to meet you.
- Karen Gaffney.

54:08.240 --> 54:10.629
Yeah, well, welcome
to my home away from home.

54:10.720 --> 54:12.870
Or to be more accurate, my home.

54:12.960 --> 54:15.872
But not for long.
Here, please. Thank you.

54:16.040 --> 54:17.109
Sit down here.

54:17.200 --> 54:18.918
Let me just clear this stuff away.

54:20.240 --> 54:21.798
Get this laundry outta here.

54:22.960 --> 54:23.960
Uh...

54:24.600 --> 54:25.794
It's the maid's day off.

54:25.880 --> 54:28.030
Not at all. It's just that

54:28.160 --> 54:29.991
when you told us to meet you
at the van,

54:30.120 --> 54:31.678
I didn't realize
you'd be living in it.

54:31.760 --> 54:33.557
Yeah, well, the truth is...

54:33.640 --> 54:35.680
you know, I've been living
in the old Westfalia here

54:35.880 --> 54:39.190
ever since my wife left me
and took everything I had.

54:39.280 --> 54:41.077
- Sorry, Carl.
- That's terrible.

54:41.160 --> 54:43.799
And now thanks to you for bringing me
in on this deal, Jeff.

54:43.880 --> 54:46.161
I think things are finally
starting to break my way again!

54:46.240 --> 54:47.468
What do you have for us?

54:47.680 --> 54:50.274
Oh, boy, what have I got?
Let me show you here.

54:50.720 --> 54:53.712
You know, here's something that Jeff
never thought he'd hear. Gaffney...

54:53.880 --> 54:56.553
are you ready for a level four
security clearance?

54:57.760 --> 55:00.228
- Okay.
- Okay. Here we go.

55:00.320 --> 55:01.594
- Carl.
- Yeah?

55:01.680 --> 55:03.750
You got like a red dot
on your forehead.

55:03.960 --> 55:05.680
It's called adult acne.
Thank you very mu...

55:07.880 --> 55:09.199
God!

55:09.360 --> 55:10.395
I've been hit!

55:10.640 --> 55:12.756
I've been hit! I've been hit!

55:14.080 --> 55:16.719
Oh, my God! Shit.

55:16.800 --> 55:18.080
- Are you hurt?
- I've been shot!

55:18.240 --> 55:20.310
God! No, honey, it's just the latte!

55:20.400 --> 55:22.118
It burns! It burns!

55:24.240 --> 55:26.071
Oh, shit! It's the Joneses!

55:26.640 --> 55:28.312
Try not to shoot them.

55:28.400 --> 55:29.992
Let's run for Carl's house.

55:31.160 --> 55:32.752
Oh, God!

55:36.600 --> 55:37.999
Get in the car! Now!

55:38.160 --> 55:40.469
Let us get on with
our stupid little lives!

55:43.600 --> 55:46.672
Get in the car now
and I will explain everything. Mostly.

55:46.760 --> 55:48.796
I'm tired of your
silver-tongued lies, Jones!

55:48.880 --> 55:51.269
Do you wanna get killed
out here? Get in the car!

55:51.480 --> 55:52.993
Why? So you could kill us in there?

55:53.120 --> 55:55.509
There were no spices
in your spice rack!

55:56.320 --> 55:58.834
I said get in the car.

55:59.480 --> 56:00.799
We're gonna get in the car.

56:01.240 --> 56:03.754
For Patrick and Mikey. Right, honey?

56:03.880 --> 56:05.871
Guys, now. It is very dangerous. Now!

56:06.040 --> 56:08.349
When I count to three
we're gonna run, okay?

56:08.440 --> 56:10.431
One... Two...

56:10.800 --> 56:11.915
Jeff!

56:12.000 --> 56:13.956
- Oh, my God!
- I said three!

56:14.040 --> 56:17.191
Jeff, please, would you
just get in the car?

56:17.280 --> 56:18.320
I was making a head start!

56:18.360 --> 56:19.554
On your wife?

56:19.640 --> 56:21.056
You two are acting like children
right now.

56:21.080 --> 56:23.150
Now, get in the car.
Right now. Get in this car.

56:23.240 --> 56:25.834
Put your seat belt on,
for Christ's sake.

56:26.080 --> 56:27.216
- Oh, my God.
- Come on!

56:27.240 --> 56:28.880
- Go, go, go.
- Let's go, let's go.

56:30.240 --> 56:31.719
What is going on here, Tim?

56:31.800 --> 56:33.160
Are you stealing secrets from MBI?

56:33.200 --> 56:34.838
We're not stealing secrets from you.

56:35.000 --> 56:36.558
- There they are.
- I see them.

56:36.640 --> 56:38.119
We're spies.

56:38.200 --> 56:39.656
His seat belt is jammed!
Pull over.

56:39.680 --> 56:40.829
Shut up!

56:40.920 --> 56:42.256
Jeff gets car sick
in the back!

56:42.280 --> 56:43.838
- Quiet!
- Shut up!

56:47.800 --> 56:48.869
You broke into our house.

56:48.960 --> 56:50.632
What kind of neighbors are you?

56:50.760 --> 56:53.240
You planted a bug in our house.
What kind of neighbors are you?

56:53.800 --> 56:55.631
You know, they kind of have a point.

56:56.400 --> 56:57.515
It's so hot in here.

56:57.640 --> 56:58.800
- Put the AC on. Please!
- No.

56:58.880 --> 57:00.056
Can you turn the
air conditioner on, please?

57:00.080 --> 57:02.275
- It's not going on!
- It's hot.

57:09.200 --> 57:11.031
My seat belt's not on! Wait!

57:19.280 --> 57:20.872
Okay, it's about to get weird.

57:20.960 --> 57:22.678
About to get weird?

57:36.200 --> 57:38.919
Quick question. Are you guys
the good guys or bad guys?

57:39.480 --> 57:40.549
What do you think?

57:40.640 --> 57:42.915
- I think the guys in black...
- Shit!

57:43.000 --> 57:45.514
...on the motorcycles shooting at us
might be the bad guys.

57:47.840 --> 57:49.240
Get down, get down, get down!

58:00.640 --> 58:01.914
What is that?

58:02.240 --> 58:03.639
It's camp.

58:03.720 --> 58:04.994
What?

58:05.200 --> 58:07.270
Hey, sweetie. How are you?

58:08.040 --> 58:10.156
- The cookies are for both of you.
- Karen!

58:10.240 --> 58:12.595
Mikey, if you split it,
he gets to choose first.

58:12.720 --> 58:14.119
- Karen!
- Because that's fair!

58:15.320 --> 58:17.993
Get down! Get down
Karen, get off the phone!

58:18.120 --> 58:20.190
Because otherwise you would
make one piece bigger.

58:20.280 --> 58:22.316
And then you'd pick that one.
Put Mikey on, put...

58:22.400 --> 58:24.311
Just split the cookie!
Just split the cookie!

58:26.520 --> 58:27.555
Oh, shit!

58:50.960 --> 58:52.359
To the right, Natalie.

58:52.440 --> 58:53.555
Thanks, Karen.

58:55.480 --> 58:56.515
Brake!

59:00.360 --> 59:01.839
Oh, my God!

59:06.760 --> 59:09.354
Okay. Okay. Okay.

59:13.880 --> 59:15.313
Please get out of the way.

59:15.400 --> 59:17.709
Please get out of the way
so I can see.

59:38.360 --> 59:40.920
There's something blinking on the back
of the car. Is that bad?

59:41.840 --> 59:43.637
Yes, Jeff, that is decidedly bad.

59:43.720 --> 59:45.400
You need to go out there
and take that off.

59:45.480 --> 59:47.755
- Wha... I need to take it off?
- Yes!

59:47.840 --> 59:49.398
- Well, can you slow down?
- No!

59:49.520 --> 59:51.136
- I'm driving. We're being chased.
- Get it off!

59:51.160 --> 59:52.736
I'm not gonna slow down.
They're trying to kill us!

59:52.760 --> 59:55.440
Right. Coming from the guy who
wouldn't turn on the air conditioner.

59:56.560 --> 59:57.913
Slow down a little bit.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.070
I'm getting wet! I'm getting wet!

01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:01.997
Getting wet is better
than getting shot!

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.149
It's hot!

01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:14.456
Three targets, two shots.
You got this?

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:15.754
Always.

01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:18.510
How you doing back there, Jeff?
We need you, buddy.

01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:22.434
Wait.

01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:24.832
- Okay.
- Wait.

01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:27.069
Now.

01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:29.756
I got it! I got it! Now what?

01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:31.034
Hold on, Jeff!

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:38.989
Throw it! Throw it!

01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:48.720
Oh!

01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:54.275
Five here? So, what do you think?
I think I'm stuck.

01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:57.670
Yeah. Well, I think one, two, three,
four, five... It's gotta be six.

01:00:57.760 --> 01:00:58.954
Here we go, folks.

01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:01.315
- Scrambled whites with toast.
- Thank you.

01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:03.516
- Three-egg omelet with potatoes.
- Thank you!

01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:06.239
Eggs, potatoes, and bacon.
And a side of bacon.

01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:08.595
- Yum, yum, yum, yum!
- Thank you very much.

01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:10.359
Oh, my goodness!

01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:13.230
Mmm. Mmm.

01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:17.996
What? High speed car chases
make me hungry, honey.

01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:23.313
Okay, Mr. and Mrs. Jones, if that's
who, you know, you really are.

01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:25.277
I have a couple of questions. And...

01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:28.320
I think this time
we kind of deserve the truth.

01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:29.799
You're entitled to it.

01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:31.916
Okay, question number one.

01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:33.268
Are you in the CIA?

01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:37.400
Honey, that's a wasted question.
They can't answer that.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.956
Question number two then.
Who are you after?

01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:42.034
We can't tell you.

01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:44.949
Okay. Question number three.
Is it somebody we know?

01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:46.234
Can't say that, either.

01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:48.016
You just said we were
entitled to the truth.

01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:49.976
Did say you were entitled to it.
Doesn't mean we can give it to you.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.035
You know what, honey?

01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:53.136
It's probably classified.
That's why they can't tell us.

01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:55.833
- Do you want any of this?
- Yeah. I'll have some potatoes.

01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:57.672
I'm glad everybody's just

01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:00.149
enjoying their meal
while we're in the middle

01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:02.356
of a... Like, a thing!

01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:04.496
You guys are just eating
like there's nothing going on.

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:06.033
I'm a little troubled by it!

01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:10.950
Honey! That is not okay.

01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:14.231
Fine. I'll keep asking 'til I get
something that's not classified.

01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:15.389
Is that fine with you?

01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:16.549
Okay.

01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:21.912
Question 17.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.798
After a shootout like that,
who cleans up all the bullets?

01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:28.240
Okay, can you guys
tell us anything at all?

01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:32.550
I'm not Greek. I'm Israeli.

01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:33.760
Ex-Mossad?

01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:35.509
Can't tell you.

01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:37.000
Come on. Are you guys even married?

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:38.639
Can you even tell us that?

01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:40.993
Yes. That actually you can't fake.

01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:43.794
But that's it?
Everything else was a lie?

01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:48.836
I mean, 'cause I think when you
told me that you hated your job,

01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:51.390
that seemed real. I mean,
from an HR perspective.

01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:53.152
That seemed real.

01:02:57.160 --> 01:02:59.276
You told him you hate your job?

01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:05.628
I may have mentioned
certain misgivings, in confidence.

01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:07.113
Interesting.

01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:08.548
Why is this coming out now?

01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:12.036
Because Jeff is actually
a good listener.

01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:14.953
And I did mention that
to you before, in Marrakesh.

01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:17.111
At that place that
we always go to. Hazim's.

01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:19.576
That day, we spent the whole
afternoon there.

01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:22.194
We talked about maybe getting
out of this. We talked about

01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:25.597
I could actually become
a travel writer, for real.

01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:26.874
We could maybe have a child.

01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:28.616
That was hypothetical.
It wasn't a life plan.

01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:29.914
I didn't think it...

01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:32.816
Okay, this is what we do.
Automatically, we go to Hebrew

01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:34.512
and then it's gonna be a whole thing.

01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:36.160
And who puts a bug
in a glass sculpture?

01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:38.816
I happen to like my glass sculptures
and I like to share them with people.

01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:40.496
It's a legitimate thing.
It's actually appropriate

01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:42.556
to give somebody a gift.
What isn't appropriate,

01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:45.837
however, is what you happened
to wear at the yard party.

01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:47.960
Now you want me to dress
like some kind of a sexless

01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:49.456
- elementary school nurse...
- Come on. I'm not talking...

01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:51.096
...just to fit in with
the other mothers, right?

01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:52.336
- No offense, Karen.
- You look great!

01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:54.430
You look amazing.
But you have to fit in.

01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:56.431
I mean, it's called being undercover.

01:03:56.560 --> 01:03:59.597
I mean, you had no problem
wearing a burqa in Kabul.

01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:00.680
But this is the suburbs!

01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:03.911
It's hard. Don't you get it?
Women here are vicious.

01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:05.991
Can I say? You don't know
the women here.

01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:07.909
There you go.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.035
We don't know anything.

01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:10.473
Why did you bug our house?

01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:12.040
Actually, you know less than nothing.

01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:14.151
But the agency received credible intel

01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:17.198
that someone was using your
work computer to commit treason

01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:18.840
against the United States of America.

01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:22.069
We were using you
to get to whoever they are.

01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:23.280
Why not tell him everything?

01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:24.629
Who cares?

01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:27.554
Ten years, 30 countries,
nobody finds us out,

01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:30.313
and we couldn't even
last a week in suburbia!

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:31.833
Can I pay, please?

01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:49.515
Stupid question.
What do we do now?

01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:50.635
Yeah, what do we do now?

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:52.278
Just stick to your routine.

01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:54.948
And nobody finds out
about any of this, okay?

01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:56.519
I won't tell anybody.

01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:57.635
Yeah, keep it quiet.

01:04:57.720 --> 01:04:59.438
There's this other thing
I needed to ask.

01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:03.513
I know you guys are undercover and
this whole thing is a setup, but...

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:04.696
The other day at the Cobra Club,

01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:07.439
was that about getting me drunk
and having me betray my co-workers

01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:12.833
or was that about two guys, you know,
maybe starting a friendship?

01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:15.957
It was about getting you drunk
and betraying your co-workers.

01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:18.631
Oh, okay. Yeah.

01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:20.153
But the indoor skydiving...

01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:23.856
that was about being friends.

01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:26.553
Ha! See, I told you we bonded.

01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:29.234
Okay. Remember,
nobody finds out about this.

01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:31.669
- No. I won't even tell my mom.
- Locking it up. Hey, hey.

01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:36.515
One other thing. I know I'm not
a licensed therapist, okay?

01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:40.557
But talk, communicate
with one another, okay?

01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:42.835
Jeff is big on communication.

01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:44.840
I communicate. That's what I do.

01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:46.598
- You sure do.
- Talk, talk, talk.

01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:49.194
No, no, no, no, no.
You're absolutely right, Jeff.

01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:52.191
Communication is a great thing.

01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:55.874
- All right, I'll see you.
- Bye!

01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:57.678
- Thanks!
- I should go.

01:05:57.760 --> 01:05:59.079
- Okay. Take care.
- See you.

01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:02.119
That's so nice of you
to tell them that, honey. Really.

01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:06.176
I think the Joneses
are going to be just fine.

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:07.474
Yeah.

01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:17.030
- After you, my dear.
- Thank you.

01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:32.874
Timmy!

01:06:56.280 --> 01:06:59.192
Well, it was most likely
just a gas leak. So...

01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:02.111
Well, thank you for your statements.

01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:03.713
- Thank you very much.
- Good night.

01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:10.158
Okay.

01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:12.674
Whoever killed the Joneses
are gonna come after us next.

01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:15.752
Do you think we did the right thing
by lying to the police?

01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:18.115
We promised the Joneses
that we wouldn't say anything.

01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:19.792
Do you think that
promises count, honey,

01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:21.616
when the people that we made
them to are dead?

01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:22.709
Yes!

01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:25.120
Plus,
I don't wanna be haunted.

01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:30.256
They've taken
the barricades down.

01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:31.474
Oh, my God!

01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:33.336
All right, listen,
I'm gonna grab the essentials.

01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:34.536
We're gonna need our passports.

01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:35.696
We're gonna need
our birth certificates.

01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:36.856
And we'll need some duct tape.

01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:38.154
Get some peppercorns, too!

01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:39.998
- Mikey...
- Coffee, teas, Goldfish.

01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:41.713
I'm gonna get these onions here.

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:44.776
- Don't take the onions, put 'em back.
- No, no, no, no.

01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:46.279
- You don't need onions.
- I need...

01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:48.476
- Trail mix!
- I can't choose.

01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:50.152
This is a 2,000-piece puzzle.

01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:53.228
- This is a weapon.
- Yeah! Or we can make chicken parm.

01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:54.456
- It would be nice to have...
- What! You always buy this.

01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:56.136
You should buy the organic one.
I've been through this with you.

01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:57.656
I don't wanna talk about that
right now.

01:07:57.680 --> 01:07:59.477
Jeff, don't take the ginger snaps!

01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:00.959
I know, but we might need...

01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:02.678
- Calm down, Jeff.
- Okay!

01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:04.669
I'm taking this Red Bull.

01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:07.909
Where are we going?

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.096
I don't know. Anywhere. Just pack!

01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:10.553
I've never been on the run before.

01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:13.074
I mean, should I take a bikini,
in case it's gonna get hot?

01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:16.072
No! A bathing suit? Take socks!
Socks! I need my socks.

01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:18.151
We gotta get the kids.
We gotta get my mom!

01:08:18.279 --> 01:08:20.236
Don't bring her into this!
We said twice a year.

01:08:20.319 --> 01:08:21.389
Christmas and Easter!

01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:23.675
Oh, God! Okay. Okay.

01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:28.229
- Okay. You know what?
- Karen.

01:08:28.319 --> 01:08:29.673
It's probably just a fuse.

01:08:30.479 --> 01:08:34.314
Because a house exploded, it could
just be a problem with the grid.

01:08:34.399 --> 01:08:35.435
Yeah.

01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:37.176
Maybe you should check
the fuse box, honey.

01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:38.872
- Okay, yeah.
- And I'm gonna just...

01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:40.359
stay here and pack.

01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:45.077
Maybe you should
go with me to the fuse box.

01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:47.276
That way you're not, uh, alone.

01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:50.473
Okay, here we go.

01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:52.676
Okay, okay, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah. There we go.

01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:54.238
There it is. There it is.

01:08:55.279 --> 01:08:56.349
Okay.

01:08:58.479 --> 01:08:59.696
It was just the circuit breaker.

01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:01.596
- It's okay.
- Good Lord!

01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:04.399
Don't scream. It's not what you think.

01:09:04.479 --> 01:09:07.278
What, you didn't kidnap our friends
and tie them to chairs?

01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:11.160
It is what you think. But it's
not for the reasons you think.

01:09:13.439 --> 01:09:15.953
Dan is the one
selling secrets from MBI.

01:09:16.399 --> 01:09:17.399
What?

01:09:17.479 --> 01:09:19.095
- You're right. She's very good.
- Told you.

01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:20.519
Dan, is that true?

01:09:21.479 --> 01:09:23.357
And how are you two alive?
Your house exploded.

01:09:23.439 --> 01:09:26.511
Jeff, things aren't
always what they seem.

01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:28.073
You should know that by now.

01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:47.520
So?

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:49.716
How could you not tell me
you were feeling this way?

01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:50.800
Well, look...

01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:53.474
To be honest, you are not exactly
the easiest woman in the world

01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:55.949
- for a man to admit his fears to.
- What?

01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:59.191
How can you say that to me?
I'm compassionate and sensitive.

01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:00.554
You can say anything to me.

01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:05.113
Well, calling me a pussy
in Hebrew is not helping things.

01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:11.828
Run.

01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:21.120
Whoa!

01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:23.350
You dove headfirst
through a plate glass window?

01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:25.351
It's not as hard as it seems.

01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:27.351
Who's behind all this?
Who's trying to kill you?

01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:30.910
It's an international arms dealer
who calls himself The Scorpion.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.116
The Agency's been after him for years.

01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:36.033
And your friends here
were about to sell him these.

01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:41.280
That's what we make at MBI?

01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:44.429
- What are these?
- Microchips.

01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:46.636
In the wrong hands,
the information on those chips

01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:49.638
could be used to undermine the entire
U.S. missile defense system.

01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:52.871
For the last three months, Dan's been
smuggling them out of the building.

01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:54.955
Prison-style.

01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:56.917
Wait. Prison-style? What do you mean?

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.992
I think that means he put 'em in
a balloon and stuck 'em up his butt.

01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:01.354
What?

01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:03.712
Oh, God!

01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:06.073
Why did you do this, Dan?

01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:10.472
That's exactly what
we're about to find out, Jeff.

01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:14.435
Yeah.

01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:17.039
Tim!

01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:19.076
Spread your legs, Danny boy.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:21.638
Mrs. Jones has some work to do.

01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:23.233
Natalie...

01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:25.880
Jesus. Jeff.
Jeff, please, do something!

01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:27.029
Either you talk...

01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:28.576
Jeff, stop her please!
She's a psychopath!

01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:32.070
Tim, can I just have a word with
you guys for one second, please?

01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:34.037
Please don't hurt me. Please.

01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:35.936
- Okay, okay.
- Get this psycho away from me, Jeff.

01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:37.109
Relax.

01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:39.794
We're excited that
you guys are still alive.

01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:43.714
But this is our basement. This is not
a Abu Ghraib, you know, scenario here.

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:45.950
- Our kids play down here.
- I don't like it either.

01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:47.996
But this is
a national security situation.

01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:50.958
Yeah, but you can't torch a man's
scrotum and expect him to speak.

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:52.109
You'd be surprised.

01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:56.034
These are human beings.
You gotta connect with them, okay?

01:11:56.120 --> 01:11:58.520
- Let me talk to 'em for two minutes.
- He's a people person.

01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:00.269
You have 90 seconds.

01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:02.789
Okey-dokey.

01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:12.239
Okay, Meg.

01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:20.518
Dan, I want you to know...

01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:24.470
like the HR department, this basement
is a place of non-judgment, okay?

01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:27.111
And even though
you stole from the company

01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:29.760
and betrayed your country
and cul-de-sac,

01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:33.674
and, you know, placed microchips
in your darkest cavity,

01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:34.875
mistakes happen!

01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:38.430
Oh, my God! Can we please waterboard
them and get this over with?

01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:40.473
We live in confusing times.

01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:44.075
And I think that the lines between
right and wrong become blurry.

01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:46.993
It's hard to even know what those
words mean, isn't it, Dan?

01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:49.071
What is this? Good cop, good cop?

01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:51.754
Look, I might not know
what's going on, on the sixth floor,

01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:55.958
but did you know that every time
an employee requests a raise

01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:57.473
it comes through the HR department?

01:12:57.600 --> 01:12:58.999
And I've seen your requests.

01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:03.278
And I know that they've been denied,
every time, for the last five years.

01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:07.790
That's a lot of time, Dan. Lot of good
time you gave to the company, huh?

01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:10.633
- Where's your piece of the pie?
- Exactly.

01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:12.416
You know how hard it is
to raise four children

01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:13.656
on a rocket scientist's salary?

01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:15.511
Oh, God! Shut up, you idiot!

01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:17.636
No! You shut up, Lady Macbeth!

01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:18.948
Okay.

01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:20.816
You're the one who pushed me
into this, you know that?

01:13:20.840 --> 01:13:23.718
With all your constant demands
and trendy needs.

01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:25.711
I did not tell you
to go on Jeff's computer

01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:27.472
and make a deal with an arms dealer!

01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:29.278
Well, you didn't tell me not to.

01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:32.269
Jeff...

01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:34.871
I was at the end of my rope.

01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:39.314
The financial pressure was crazy.
Groceries and tutors and...

01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:42.517
I got four kids under 13 in braces.

01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:45.079
Do you understand? Do you, Jeff?

01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:48.675
I do. You know I do. I mean...

01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:50.113
if kids have crooked teeth,

01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:51.616
we can't have crooked teeth
in this society.

01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:54.234
This isn't Great Britain, you know?

01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:57.392
There's all sorts of things
you have to keep up with and...

01:13:57.480 --> 01:13:59.869
New tires for the minivan,
piano lessons,

01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:01.791
you know, and, because all that...

01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:06.072
Carl Pronger is dead!

01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:08.879
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Hang on! Get a hold of yourself!

01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:11.599
I never wanted anyone
to get hurt, Jeff, I swear.

01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:13.238
We were protecting you.

01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:15.709
The Scorpion doesn't even
know who you are. Karen!

01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:18.376
Shut up, Meg! Brooklyn Loft is stupid.

01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:19.435
All right, not helping.

01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:20.589
I'm crying.

01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:21.795
Where did you get an onion?

01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:23.279
- Who? Me?
- Yeah, you.

01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:25.715
I got it from upstairs.
From our kitchen.

01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:34.915
Is this your phone?
Is this the Scorpion calling?

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:36.456
I'm gonna answer this
and you're gonna talk to him.

01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:37.879
And you're gonna lead us to him.

01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:39.496
He'll sniff me out in a second.
You know what he's capable of.

01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:41.750
- Answer the phone now.
- Natalie...

01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:42.955
No more games.

01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:46.516
Look, I can't. I'm not a spy!
I'm a soccer dad!

01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:47.999
He never misses a game.

01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:49.877
Oh, my God. All right,
I'm gonna answer it.

01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:51.736
No, we can't.
Our cover was blown, remember?

01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:53.176
Well, I don't have
a lot of options.

01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:54.474
What do you want me to do?

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:00.069
Hello?

01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:02.230
Hello? Mr. Rascal Flatts?

01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:06.397
I needed a cover name.

01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:08.195
Hello?

01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:09.474
Hi!

01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:12.597
Um... Yes, this is Rascal.

01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:14.955
Are you and your wife
ready to make the deal?

01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:21.600
Yes, Mrs. Flatts and I
are very excited about it.

01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:24.911
Tomorrow night.
The Odyssey Hotel. 9:00 p. m.

01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:29.355
Go to the V-Bar.
A table will be reserved for you.

01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:31.874
Bring the requested item and wait.

01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:34.793
V-Bar. Okay thank you very much.

01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:37.394
J ust out of curiosity,
is there a dress code?

01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:41.710
I'll... I can look that up online.

01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:43.832
Okay.

01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:46.920
What have I done?

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:50.276
No, no. You did everything great!
You did everything great.

01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:51.429
- Okay.
- You did!

01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:53.670
- I did.
- Jeff and Karen, welcome to

01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:55.478
the sexy and exciting world

01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:58.154
of international espionage
and covert operations.

01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:04.070
Buddy, I think it's time
we get you in a proper suit.

01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:06.151
Nice! Is it an extra medium?

01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:07.912
A killer dress.

01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:09.720
That's all of it?

01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:12.473
This tie has been fitted
with a miniature surveillance mic.

01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:14.710
It's completely undetectable.

01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:17.115
I don't know if I can walk in these.

01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:18.997
The heel is equipped
with a tracking device

01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:21.469
that allows us to monitor
your every move.

01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:24.597
Natalie and I will secure
a position right upstairs on the roof.

01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:26.750
And establish a command center.

01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:29.638
Now, you know at some point,
you're gonna have to put on pants.

01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:31.836
Yeah. I know. I'm just nervous still.

01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:33.148
It's gonna be okay.

01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:34.639
Simple in and out job.

01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:36.836
Make the exchange, leave the hotel.

01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:40.356
Got it. In and out.
Just out of curiosity,

01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:43.159
what happens, you know,
worst-case scenario?

01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:45.632
Worst-case scenario?

01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:47.790
We radio for backup,
and we storm the place

01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:50.030
with the full force
of the United States government.

01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:51.999
Okay. Got it.

01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:53.479
- Okay?
- Yeah.

01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:56.518
You look good.
Don't forget those pants.

01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:23.639
Reminds me of our first date.

01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:27.029
And our second.

01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:30.994
What's wrong?

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:36.072
We never really did finish
that conversation, did we?

01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:38.674
Well, the house did explode.

01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:40.034
So...

01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:45.119
Look, I just want you to know
I realized something last night

01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:47.350
when I was about to fry
Dan's testicles.

01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:50.232
I know I'm not the best listener,

01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:51.912
but I can change.

01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:54.592
What? You don't think I can?

01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:57.069
No, no, no. I know you can.

01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:02.832
Just don't change too much, okay?

01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:06.235
Okay.

01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:23.075
Honey, are you ready?
What are you doing?

01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:25.549
I was just listening
to some Rascal Flatts.

01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:27.471
- Trying to get into character.
- Oh, God!

01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:29.755
Patrick leaves these toys
on the stairs.

01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:32.877
- Somebody's gonna hurt themselves.
- Karen!

01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:35.758
What? Do you like it? Is it too much?

01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:37.990
No! Not at all. It's just enough.

01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:39.080
Thanks, honey.

01:18:39.160 --> 01:18:40.976
Is this the lingerie
you were wearing the other day?

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.136
Yeah, I figured if we're gonna
do this, I should do it right.

01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:45.116
Yeah.

01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:49.397
- You look so handsome.
- Oh, thank you very much.

01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:50.976
How much time until
we have to be at the hotel?

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:52.911
We've got 45 minutes.

01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:07.393
- Karen. Karen.
- Jeff,

01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:09.232
your tie's stuck.

01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:10.440
- Karen!
- Ooh! Sorry, honey.

01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:18.669
What?

01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:21.275
I think they're having sex.

01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:25.032
Goddamn it,
we don't have time for this.

01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:27.554
I mean, they're supposed to be
here in 45 minutes.

01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:31.475
Nope, they are done.

01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:34.949
All right.

01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:05.790
Oh, wow! Look, honey.
Beautiful design!

01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:07.438
- Hey, Karen.
- Yeah?

01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:09.513
Thanks so much for the sex.

01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:10.600
Oh...

01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:17.789
Go.

01:20:18.320 --> 01:20:19.594
Hello!

01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:23.149
- Hi.
- Hi. We have a reservation for two

01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:25.595
under the name Rascal Flatts.

01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:26.795
It's not our real name.

01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:29.030
We're having an affair.

01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:30.155
Come with me.

01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:36.318
Hey, Tim. We're in the restaurant
right now. Everything's going okay.

01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:38.075
Honey, sushi.

01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:41.118
There's sushi as well.
I'm gonna sign off for right now.

01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:43.114
Ciao.

01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:46.590
- Oh, that's our table.
- No, this way.

01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:49.989
Really?

01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:55.033
Thank you so much.

01:20:57.800 --> 01:20:59.518
Is this the line to
the little boys' room?

01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:01.477
- I don't need to use it.
- Come.

01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:06.872
I'm confused. I...

01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:09.918
It's part of the...
I thought it was just gonna be us.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:11.638
You fellas with The Scorpion?

01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:19.998
All right, they're on the move.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:22.353
Moving into position.

01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:35.749
Thank you.

01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:45.237
There he is. Rascal Flatts.

01:21:45.320 --> 01:21:46.878
You have any trouble
finding the place?

01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:48.160
No. Your henchmen were very...

01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:49.696
I'm a little
ticklish there.

01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:51.039
Your henchmen were very helpful.

01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:54.396
This must be the wife. Wow! You guys
really dressed up for tonight.

01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:56.914
Thank you. Yeah.
Well, we don't get out very often.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.116
When we do, we really
like to make the most of it.

01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:01.430
Awesome. Ivan?

01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:03.039
All clear.

01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:06.112
Sorry about the frisking. You cannot
be too careful in my line of work.

01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:07.599
Let me make it up to you

01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:10.717
with some very expensive,
very delicious champagne.

01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:13.798
Wow! Look at that gun.

01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:14.949
And by the way,

01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:18.316
you two have gotta try this dip.
It's amazing.

01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:20.936
It's a cheat day for me, so I went
a little crazy with room service.

01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:22.280
I hope you don't mind.

01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:24.788
Mrs. Flatts makes a great
seven-layer dip. I'll tell you that.

01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:26.154
I bet she does.

01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:30.358
I do. The secret is an extra layer.
An eight-layer dip.

01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:32.510
Sneaky! I love that.

01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:37.878
Do I know you from somewhere?

01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:40.673
I seriously doubt it.

01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:42.868
He's a people person.

01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:46.157
Come on, Jeff. Stay calm.
Just do what we talked about.

01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:50.196
Well, did the people person
bring this person his computer chips?

01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:53.394
Oh, yes. Yes, yes.
You'll find them right here.

01:22:53.480 --> 01:22:54.879
Careful.

01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:12.388
Denver, 2010.

01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:15.317
Were you at the National
Aerospace Convention?

01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:17.789
Because I think we were
in the same focus group.

01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:19.869
Are we still doing this?

01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:22.235
No, we're n... it's done.
It's really done. It's so done.

01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:23.912
Why does he keep
asking those questions?

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.798
I don't think he can help it.
It's just what he does.

01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:29.394
He connects with people.

01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:31.550
- Perfect, as promised.
- Shit.

01:23:31.640 --> 01:23:32.959
Ivan?

01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:39.433
Wow. Okay. Here we go. Thank you.

01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:41.556
- Okay! We got it. Great.
- Yeah. That checks out.

01:23:41.640 --> 01:23:43.949
Well, pleasure doing business
with both of you.

01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:46.116
Thank you, Mr. Scorpion and friends.

01:23:46.200 --> 01:23:48.873
Thank you. Yeah.
Okay. Grab that stuff.

01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:52.831
Hey! You drop your little ball.

01:23:52.920 --> 01:23:54.616
That's fine. We have...
I have plenty of those.

01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:56.517
Keep it. Keep it. It's a...

01:23:56.600 --> 01:23:58.272
- Excuse me.
- Stop!

01:24:05.960 --> 01:24:07.359
You're the HR guy.

01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:09.908
No, he's not. He's an engineer.
He... Dr. Flatts.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:11.856
- Yeah, I'm in the rocket sciences.
- He went to college!

01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:14.633
- He's very smart. MIT.
- No.

01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:16.517
No. You were right.

01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:18.238
We have met before.

01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:23.872
See from '02 to '05,
I was a mid-level drone at MBI.

01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:27.191
- And you are Jeff Gaffney.
- No.

01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:28.838
- Human Resources.
- Wrong.

01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:32.071
Yeah. You helped me
with my "suicidal depression."

01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:34.674
With your little trust exercises
and stress balls!

01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:37.518
This entire thing is a setup!

01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:39.113
Goddamn it, Jeff!

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.355
Decoys have been made.
I repeat, decoys have been made.

01:24:42.440 --> 01:24:43.793
We need to extract. Do you copy?

01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:46.599
Carlos, take a team out,
lock the hallway down.

01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:49.069
Yuri, take four guys up
the stairwell to the roof.

01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:51.674
Radio the helicopter, we are getting
the hell out of here.

01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:54.638
We need backup to extract
the decoys. Do you copy?

01:24:54.720 --> 01:24:56.836
Negative. Collateral damage.

01:24:56.920 --> 01:24:59.832
We cannot engage in a public arena.
Pull back and abort.

01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:01.239
Do you copy?

01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:03.709
Jones, do you copy?

01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:06.875
Boris, get some ice tongs
and a cigarette lighter.

01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:10.753
Goddamn it, Jones. Do you copy?

01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:15.236
Copy, copy. Pulling out.
I repeat, pulling out.

01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:17.151
We'll meet you
at the extraction point.

01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:22.870
You really wanna
just leave them in there?

01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:24.279
Of course not.

01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:27.317
They're our neighbors.

01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:29.951
Sweetie, everything's fine, okay?

01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:32.296
That's why I rent the extra henchmen,
for situations like this.

01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:34.038
- Is it Peter? No.
- That's why I paid

01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:35.776
- for the whole floor.
- Honey, what are you doing?

01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:37.776
- I'm trying to figure out his name.
- Chopper to the jet.

01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:39.016
We'll be in Jakarta by morning,

01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:40.520
- and when we get there, I...
- Bruce.

01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:43.628
You talking to me?

01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:46.510
I remember your name.
Your name is Bruce.

01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:48.469
Bruce Springstine.

01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:51.711
I... No, I think you have me
confused with somebody else.

01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:54.189
Nah, I'm the one that mediated
your parking space dispute.

01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:57.272
Is that what caused you
to go into a life of crime?

01:25:57.360 --> 01:25:59.954
A bruised ego
over a lousy parking space?

01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:02.508
Jesus Christ! What is this?
Amateur night?

01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:03.749
Wait a second.

01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:06.559
Your name is Bruce Springstine?

01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:09.240
Yes, Ivan, it is.
It's Bruce Springstine

01:26:09.320 --> 01:26:11.320
and it's a perfectly good name
like any other name.

01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:14.153
And you wanted us
to call you The Boss?

01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:16.754
I didn't want you guys
to call me "The Boss."

01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:18.558
I wanted you to call me, "Boss."

01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:22.076
All right? And that's just
for simplicity's sake. Okay?

01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:23.354
That's just sad.

01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:26.273
And that parking space thing
was bullshit, all right?

01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:29.272
I'd been there for three years!
They still had me in Lot D!

01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:32.033
That's the other side
of the highway, okay?

01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:33.348
I had to cross the...

01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:34.856
- The footbridge thing. Yeah!
- The little... The footbridge!

01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:36.313
A footbridge, every day,

01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:37.469
rain or shine!

01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:38.913
So, thank you.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:40.640
- I am really going to enjoy this.
- Okay.

01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:42.120
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
- No!

01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:44.109
Good. SEAL team's here.

01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:45.918
Go, go, go! Get down,
get down, get down!

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:50.232
Go, boys! Go, go, go!
Shock and awe! Shock and awe!

01:26:54.520 --> 01:26:56.795
Honey, I can't hear anything.

01:26:56.880 --> 01:26:58.856
They're silent killers.
That's how they got Bin Laden.

01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:00.950
- Let's just stay down, okay?
- Okay.

01:27:01.720 --> 01:27:02.720
Ahem!

01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:13.548
Where's the backup?
Those guys are with him.

01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:15.198
There's no backup, Jeff.

01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:16.998
They pulled out
when you blew your cover.

01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:19.992
What do you mean there's no backup?

01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:22.640
You're what they call
"collateral damage."

01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:24.312
That's not good. I saw it on Homeland!

01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:27.000
What do you me... You didn't say
anything about collateral damage!

01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:29.056
I asked you about the worst-case
scenario and you said,

01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:31.071
"Well, the worst-case scenario,
I'll have backup."

01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:34.789
Well, this is worse! This is worse
than the worst-case scenario.

01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:36.199
You lied to our faces.

01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:40.671
I did not lie to you. Now, I may
have left out a few key details...

01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:42.034
That's a lie, Timothy!

01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:44.156
That is lying by omission.
That's textbook...

01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:47.676
You know what? My whole job is lying.
Okay? That's why I fucking hate it!

01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:52.156
- I'm sorry, Jeff.
- You're apologizing to him?

01:27:52.240 --> 01:27:54.435
You can't possibly care
about this loser.

01:27:54.520 --> 01:27:57.398
You know what? I actually
do care about this loser.

01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:00.915
I mean, you and I live
in a world where everybody lies.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.878
And everybody hides everything
and obfuscates.

01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:06.190
But, not... Not Jeff Gaffney.

01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:10.557
Jeff doesn't live in that world.
He's an honest person.

01:28:10.680 --> 01:28:13.672
He's forthright, he's friendly.
He's a good neighbor.

01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:18.389
Do you have any idea how much
courage that takes? Real courage?

01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:21.480
For my money, he's the bravest guy
in this room.

01:28:22.520 --> 01:28:24.715
- Oh, please. Spare me the morality!
- Hey!

01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:26.870
Just hear me out, all right?

01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:29.356
Look, the Gaffneys,
they don't belong in our world.

01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:31.317
We don't. We really don't.

01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:33.789
Okay? They're too good for that.

01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:35.996
Why don't we let them go
back to their world?

01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:38.117
And then you and I, we,

01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:39.713
can settle this here?

01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:41.438
Here in our world.

01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:44.432
You guys can go murder each other
and stuff. Just leave us out of this.

01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:46.696
You know what? I'm just gonna take
care of everything myself. Bruno,

01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:49.056
lay the plastic sheeting out. I don't
wanna lose the security deposit.

01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:51.799
- Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
- Can I finish a thought today?

01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:54.474
I'm so sorry, Mr. Scorpion.

01:28:54.560 --> 01:28:56.676
But, Natalie,

01:28:56.760 --> 01:28:58.910
ever since we tried on
underwear together...

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:00.752
- I'm sorry. You talking to her?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:29:00.840 --> 01:29:01.955
Finish your thought.

01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:04.471
I realized something.

01:29:05.960 --> 01:29:07.359
I've been living a lie, also.

01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:13.034
Karen!

01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:15.080
What is happening to my life?

01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:30.351
Oh, my God! How long
have you been living that lie?

01:29:30.440 --> 01:29:31.440
Honey! What? No!

01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:33.816
I didn't mean it. I just had to
get the knife to her somehow!

01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:38.152
Okay! I get it now. God! Thank God!
Okay, it's gonna be okay.

01:29:51.760 --> 01:29:52.875
It's raining men!

01:29:57.720 --> 01:29:58.914
You guys okay?

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.798
Grab the chips and follow us.
Come on, let's go.

01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:11.760
- Chopper's ready.
- Yeah, get 'em.

01:30:11.840 --> 01:30:12.955
And get the chips!

01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:16.798
Get back, get back, get back!

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.230
- I'm almost out.
- Me too.

01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:26.308
What are we gonna do?

01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:31.439
- We'll have to jump for it.
- Jump? Jump from where?

01:30:31.680 --> 01:30:32.795
Down there.

01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:34.320
There's a pool down below.

01:30:35.240 --> 01:30:36.798
It's our only chance.

01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:38.376
Did you think
any of this through?

01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:39.719
Okay.

01:30:42.360 --> 01:30:43.840
Whoa! Whoa!
Where are you going?

01:30:47.480 --> 01:30:49.948
Jeff? Jeff!

01:30:50.960 --> 01:30:52.552
Jeff. Jeff are you okay?

01:30:52.640 --> 01:30:53.959
- I just farted.
- Buddy!

01:30:54.040 --> 01:30:55.536
You can't jump through
the window like that.

01:30:55.560 --> 01:30:57.755
That's triple pane glass!
You gotta break it first.

01:30:57.840 --> 01:30:59.512
Appreciate the effort though.

01:30:59.640 --> 01:31:01.600
Scoot back, everybody, all right?
Just scoot back.

01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:04.634
Get out of the way.

01:31:08.720 --> 01:31:09.755
Really?

01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:10.989
Stand back!

01:31:11.080 --> 01:31:12.354
What?

01:31:17.320 --> 01:31:18.400
Where'd you get that?

01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:19.993
I picked it up off a dead guy.

01:31:20.120 --> 01:31:21.216
- I thought he didn't need it.
- Run! Out of the window!

01:31:21.240 --> 01:31:22.456
All right. Come on.
We're doing this. Let's go!

01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:24.357
- Now! Now!
- Jump! Jump! Jump!

01:31:27.080 --> 01:31:28.274
Whoa!

01:31:32.120 --> 01:31:33.678
It's okay, everybody. It's okay.

01:31:33.800 --> 01:31:34.915
Where's Jeff?

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:36.000
Guys, where's Jeff?

01:31:40.240 --> 01:31:41.389
Jeff! Jeff, you've gotta...

01:31:41.480 --> 01:31:43.152
- Jeff, you've gotta jump!
- Jeff!

01:31:43.240 --> 01:31:44.468
Give me a second.

01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:46.840
- Jeff, jump! Please!
- Just run and jump!

01:31:48.480 --> 01:31:49.480
Oh...

01:31:49.560 --> 01:31:51.630
This is perfect.

01:31:52.400 --> 01:31:54.994
You've been a pain
in my ass all day, Jeff.

01:31:55.080 --> 01:31:58.072
Okay, li... Bru... Mr. Scorpion,

01:31:58.200 --> 01:32:00.236
we all make choices in life and I...

01:32:00.320 --> 01:32:02.470
I'm not being judgmental,
I promise you,

01:32:02.560 --> 01:32:05.711
but do you really think that violence
is the solution? There's this exer...

01:32:08.680 --> 01:32:10.318
He's all yours, gravity.

01:32:20.920 --> 01:32:22.478
And that's why you don't sting the...

01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:33.673
Always have plan B.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:56.911
I know it seemed a lot higher.

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:58.296
Thank you very much.
That's for you. Keep it all.

01:32:58.320 --> 01:32:59.936
Maybe you could videotape
that and put it online.

01:32:59.960 --> 01:33:01.678
Where did you get the gun from?

01:33:01.760 --> 01:33:03.736
No. I don't think we're
gonna keep any of that online.

01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:04.920
That would get a lot of hits.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:06.319
And I lined it up, and smashed.

01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:07.913
Because there's shooting...

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:09.376
Probably wanna keep it
a little on the down low.

01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:11.755
Yes. Of course.
Yeah, no, no, of course. Yes. Yes.

01:33:11.840 --> 01:33:12.909
I'm just saying.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:14.592
I'm so proud of you guys.

01:33:14.680 --> 01:33:16.557
- You guys wanna come inside?
- Yeah, come in.

01:33:16.640 --> 01:33:17.720
Where are you guys staying?

01:33:18.880 --> 01:33:20.598
- You could stay with us!
- Stay with us!

01:33:20.680 --> 01:33:22.910
Why wouldn't you stay with us?
We have a pull-out couch.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.958
You can borrow some of my boxer briefs
if you need anything to lounge in.

01:33:26.040 --> 01:33:27.856
- I've got a Wii.
- We've got a flat screen TV!

01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:29.438
We have free Wi-Fi.

01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:32.193
- You guys are great! Really.
- It's very nice of you to offer.

01:33:32.280 --> 01:33:33.349
But...

01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:34.668
Our ride is coming.

01:33:34.760 --> 01:33:37.752
Yeah. Yeah.
You got your things you have to do.

01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:39.199
Your missions.

01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:48.474
Is that an Uber?

01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:49.874
Sort of.

01:33:52.040 --> 01:33:53.155
Hug?

01:33:53.240 --> 01:33:55.310
- Just a hug?
- Just a hug.

01:33:56.840 --> 01:33:58.751
Thank you. You're an amazing woman.

01:33:59.760 --> 01:34:00.954
Thank you.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.040
You made an incredible life
for yourself here, Jeff.

01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:08.308
Just remember to leave the cul-de-sac,
every now and again.

01:34:08.920 --> 01:34:11.309
You'd be surprised
at what you find out there.

01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:14.675
We'll remember.

01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:17.312
- Time to go.
- Yes.

01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:23.437
Where's the driver?

01:34:24.440 --> 01:34:25.873
Right here.

01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:28.437
There's no driver in the car.

01:34:28.520 --> 01:34:30.296
If they're shooting at us,
I get to drive.

01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:31.912
Now you wanna drive.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:33.115
I see how it works.

01:34:34.520 --> 01:34:35.873
You get to drive the good car.

01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:38.679
Bye, you guys!

01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:48.235
Okay.

01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:54.430
You know, it's Parents Day
at the camp tomorrow.

01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:27.472
This is going straight
to Facebook. Keep sucking!

01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:30.518
- That's good.
- What does it taste like?

01:35:30.880 --> 01:35:32.757
It tastes like Mikey's sock.

01:35:32.840 --> 01:35:34.717
But I mean that in a good way.
Here, try it.

01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:37.189
Oh, I miss Mikey's little feet
and his socks.

01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:38.599
Yeah. Here.

01:35:39.960 --> 01:35:41.075
Okay, ready?

01:35:42.240 --> 01:35:44.515
Oh, God! That really hurt.

01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:47.474
What?

01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:50.279
Oh, my God!

01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:52.430
- Guys!
- Natalie! Tim!

01:35:52.520 --> 01:35:54.192
You've gotta be kidding me!

01:35:54.840 --> 01:35:55.840
What?

01:35:55.920 --> 01:35:57.956
- Can I take this?
- Are you kidding me?

01:35:58.040 --> 01:35:59.598
We are here because of you.

01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:00.800
You told us about this place

01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:02.233
and that's why we came!

01:36:02.360 --> 01:36:04.112
You are here. In Marrakesh.

01:36:04.200 --> 01:36:05.758
- That's a good memory. Wow.
- Amazing!

01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:06.955
- What?
- That's amazing.

01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:08.678
- My God.
- You have a baby!

01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:10.955
- Yes, he just fell asleep.
- He just fell asleep.

01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:13.190
You had a baby? You old dogs!

01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:15.635
Does that mean
you guys left the agency?

01:36:15.720 --> 01:36:17.438
- Well, yeah. It's a very...
- Well...

01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:18.748
- Yeah?
- Long story.

01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:21.070
But we can't really
get into it right now.

01:36:21.160 --> 01:36:24.232
But, it's good to see you!

01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:26.515
Jeff, do me a big favor?
Will you just...

01:36:26.600 --> 01:36:28.296
- scoot a little bit to your right?
- Yeah. Sure thing.

01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:29.548
Thank you!

01:36:29.640 --> 01:36:31.312
I am blown away, you guys.
This is un...

01:36:31.400 --> 01:36:33.834
Jeff, I don't want you
to turn around right now,

01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:37.356
but there are four guys in fezzes
behind you on the...

01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:38.776
Jeff, I just said don't turn around.

01:36:38.800 --> 01:36:40.456
Jeff, I just specifically
asked you not to turn around.

01:36:40.480 --> 01:36:42.216
I know but you said there are four
guys in fezzes behind me.

01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:43.536
We're in Morocco.
There's a lot of fezzes.

01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:45.056
But it's human nature,
I think, to turn around

01:36:45.080 --> 01:36:46.672
to something like that.
Don't you think?

01:36:46.760 --> 01:36:48.193
Honey. We blew their cover again.

01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:50.311
- No! No.
- What?

01:36:50.400 --> 01:36:52.256
- We should feed the baby?
- I think we should feed the baby.

01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:53.776
- If you can just pass me the bottle...
- We blew their cover?

01:36:53.800 --> 01:36:55.176
- ...that would be great.
- Darn it.

01:36:55.200 --> 01:36:57.216
- Can you hold this bag for me?
- Do you mind holding the baby?

01:36:57.240 --> 01:36:59.993
Before you freak out,
it's just a baby.

01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:02.056
- All right? Don't worry.
- Kids are great! I have pictures.

01:37:02.080 --> 01:37:03.136
- Karen, how do you get...
- I'll tell you what.

01:37:03.160 --> 01:37:04.718
Just put it in here and show me.

01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:06.199
Kind of see what I'm dealing with.

01:37:06.360 --> 01:37:07.793
Okay. I see now.

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:09.479
Okay? See what that is?

01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:11.391
- It's okay, honey.
- I need you to breathe.

01:37:11.480 --> 01:37:13.096
- You can do it.
- You've done this before.

01:37:13.120 --> 01:37:16.669
On three, I want you to get down,
and take cover. Okay?

01:37:16.760 --> 01:37:17.829
One...

01:37:17.920 --> 01:37:18.920
Two...

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.036
Jesus, Jeff!
Everybody down, right now.

01:37:26.280 --> 01:37:28.748
- I miss those guys.
- Me too.
