00:05.038 --> 00:07.370
# Good morning, U.S.A. #

00:07.474 --> 00:11.069
# I got a feeling that it's
gonna be a wonderful day #

00:11.177 --> 00:14.078
#The sun in the sky
has a smile on his face #

00:14.180 --> 00:17.946
#And he's shining a salute
to the American race #

00:20.620 --> 00:23.987
# Oh, boy
it's swell to say #

00:24.090 --> 00:26.752
<i># Good morning, U.S.A. #</i>

00:28.695 --> 00:31.926
<i>#Good morning, U.S.A. ##</i>

00:34.534 --> 00:38.334
Kill. Kill. Don't kill.

00:39.506 --> 00:42.669
Hey! I went to high school
with this guy. Kill.

00:42.776 --> 00:46.303
Smith, a former K.G.B. Agent
has gone missing.

00:46.413 --> 00:50.440
Ah, yes. Sergei Kruglov,
the wolf of Leningrad.

00:50.550 --> 00:52.882
I tangled with him
when I was a young agent.

00:58.725 --> 01:00.625
Exchange the captured spies.

01:08.501 --> 01:11.129
Look, Sergei.
Over there lies the West.

01:11.237 --> 01:13.501
People are buying
Bobby McFerrin tapes, Jolt Cola...

01:13.606 --> 01:15.506
and Scottie Pippen sneakers.

01:15.608 --> 01:19.442
That's capitalism! And it's gonna
triumph over your lousy system.

01:19.546 --> 01:23.107
I laugh at your decadent
Western ways.

01:23.216 --> 01:27.846
Behind you lies Communism,
the paradise of the proletariat.

01:27.954 --> 01:30.616
Free of excess,
devoted to the cause.

01:30.723 --> 01:34.955
Look at the strength
and power of- Grab him!

01:35.061 --> 01:38.121
- Damn it, Stan!
- Every time!

01:38.231 --> 01:41.132
I spent the next six months
in a Communist prison.

01:41.234 --> 01:45.500
I vowed to dedicate my whole
career to hunting down Sergei.

01:45.605 --> 01:48.540
But I forgot. You know, had some kids,
focused on the lawn.

01:48.641 --> 01:51.667
- The Redskins were good.
- As you know, Communism's fallen.

01:51.778 --> 01:55.737
And Sergei's retired. But we still
like to keep an eye on these people.

01:55.849 --> 01:59.546
We were monitoring Sergei
through his Columbia House account.

01:59.652 --> 02:01.620
Nothing unusual,
Sheryl Crow and the like.

02:01.721 --> 02:05.987
<i>- But now, even they've lost track of him.
- Damn LimeWire!</i>

02:06.092 --> 02:09.858
Anyway, if you find this fellow,
you'll get a promotion and a pay raise.

02:09.963 --> 02:14.457
Climbing the corporate ladder! That's
the kind of rush those Reds never got to feel.

02:14.567 --> 02:18.298
They also never got to feel
the smooth comfort of these Air Pippens.

02:20.473 --> 02:22.373
Get that junk out of here.

02:25.745 --> 02:29.545
Where would a Communist go?
Cuba? China?

02:29.649 --> 02:32.379
Back in time to kill Betsy Ross?

02:32.485 --> 02:34.715
<i>Dad! You're finally home!
I need your help.</i>

02:34.821 --> 02:36.721
Sorry, son.
I've got too much work to do.

02:36.823 --> 02:40.122
But it's for the rocket contest at school!
Whoever's flies highest...

02:40.226 --> 02:43.821
will be undisputed champion
of aerodynamics and Newtonian physics.

02:43.930 --> 02:47.661
<i>And you know that'll translate
into some attention from the ladies.</i>

02:47.767 --> 02:52.170
I'll be adjusting a few Delta wing stabilizers.

02:52.272 --> 02:55.264
Right? That's something
a guy says, right?

02:55.375 --> 02:57.900
I don't know, Steve.
A puppy's a lot of responsibility.

02:58.011 --> 03:00.775
Check it out, Dad!

03:03.316 --> 03:05.546
Oh, no!
It's gonna hit...

03:05.652 --> 03:07.813
Mr. Halworthy's house!

03:07.921 --> 03:11.220
Great. Wait here.

03:11.324 --> 03:15.454
- Mr. Halworthy?
- What's that smell?

03:19.432 --> 03:23.664
Oh, now I recognize it.
It's freshly-cut grass on a summer's day.

03:23.770 --> 03:25.670
And death.

03:31.878 --> 03:34.312
Here you go, scamp.

03:36.416 --> 03:41.149
He must've been dead for weeks.
Mom, you might wanna sit down.

03:41.254 --> 03:45.156
I hate to tell you this,
but Mr. Halworthy has passed.

03:45.258 --> 03:47.158
Oh.

03:47.260 --> 03:50.229
Nutty Bars!
They stock Nutty Bars now!

03:50.330 --> 03:52.730
I asked the man and he got them.

03:52.832 --> 03:55.960
My rocket's ruined!
Dad, can you help me build a new one?

03:56.069 --> 03:58.333
- Steve, do you get paid for your rocket?
- No.

03:58.438 --> 04:01.703
Then it has no value. You see, son,
we're part of a wonderful system.

04:01.808 --> 04:04.538
It's the glorious orgy
of American capitalism.

04:04.644 --> 04:07.169
I get a snazzy new title
and a bigger paycheck.

04:07.280 --> 04:10.078
Then I give my money to your mother
who spends it on speeding tickets.

04:10.183 --> 04:12.413
I like to race school buses.

04:13.686 --> 04:17.622
I'm a ninja, everybody!
I'm doing ninja stuff now.

04:17.724 --> 04:19.190
Klaus?

04:23.429 --> 04:26.421
No! Can't you see
I'm trying to kill myself?

04:26.532 --> 04:28.432
What?
Why would you do that?

04:28.534 --> 04:32.595
You know what today is?
Two days after my birthday.

04:32.705 --> 04:35.299
No. No, that's not right.
I don't remember having a cake or anything.

04:35.408 --> 04:38.377
That's my point!
Nobody cares about me!

04:38.478 --> 04:41.936
You're just stuck in a rut. You know what?
You need a change of scenery.

04:42.048 --> 04:45.814
- Let's take a trip!
- Well, I'd love to go back to Europe.

04:45.918 --> 04:48.648
- Do you know I've never even been?
- Oh, you simply must.

04:48.755 --> 04:51.747
Don't you ever tell me what to do!

04:51.858 --> 04:54.554
I'm sorry. I overreacted.
Yes. We should go to Europe.

04:57.430 --> 05:00.160
<i>Look at my little
Disney's The Rocketeer.</i>

05:00.266 --> 05:02.359
- How's it goin'?
- Not so well.

05:02.468 --> 05:04.834
I can't figure out what's wrong,
and Dad's too busy.

05:04.937 --> 05:10.170
You know, if we put some glitter on,
it'll look just like a shooting star.

05:10.276 --> 05:12.710
Thanks, Mom.
But that's not gonna make it fly better.

05:12.812 --> 05:15.178
Well, how about we glue on
some raisins?

05:15.281 --> 05:17.340
That way if it breaks up on re-entry...

05:17.450 --> 05:21.147
everyone'll get a tasty treat
instead of a national tragedy.

05:23.690 --> 05:26.818
<i>All right, Sergei.
Are you here?</i>

05:34.000 --> 05:37.265
Nope. How 'bout... here?

05:43.176 --> 05:45.610
There's gotta be a faster way.

05:45.712 --> 05:49.478
- Stan Smith here.
- Stan, do you think you'll be home anytime soon?

05:49.582 --> 05:52.710
Steve's having a little trouble
with his rocket.

05:52.819 --> 05:54.719
Aah! Raisins!

05:54.821 --> 05:58.120
Stan, this is really something
a boy needs his father for.

05:58.224 --> 06:00.749
All right. Let me take a look.

06:04.230 --> 06:07.290
Francine, turn around.

06:07.400 --> 06:10.028
There you go.
Hey, Jackson, check it out.

06:17.744 --> 06:20.941
I can't believe we really did it!
I mean, we're in Europe!

06:21.047 --> 06:23.675
Nine hours ago, we were in America!

06:25.551 --> 06:28.452
- I just think we'll be better off.
- No. I get it. I get it.

06:32.024 --> 06:35.824
- Dad! You're finally home!
- I've been searching for Sergei all day.

06:35.928 --> 06:38.726
I zoomed in on 100 people
in over four countries.

06:38.831 --> 06:41.425
None of them were him.
So we have to conclude he's dead.

06:42.368 --> 06:44.893
Rest in peace, my sworn enemy.

06:47.106 --> 06:49.131
Hello, neighbor.

06:55.681 --> 06:57.740
Sergei!

07:01.421 --> 07:06.085
Relax, Smith. I am no longer K.G.B. Agent.
I am American now!

07:06.192 --> 07:07.659
Yeah, right.

07:07.760 --> 07:09.660
It's true, Stan.
Look in my wallet.

07:10.763 --> 07:12.856
A Costco card!

07:12.965 --> 07:16.731
<i>- It is true.
- You don't know how happy I am to be here.</i>

07:16.836 --> 07:19.634
All the time I was under
the boot of Communism...

07:19.739 --> 07:23.072
I'd dream of living like
C.I.A. Man, Stan Smith.

07:23.176 --> 07:26.976
I made fantasies about
American town of Langley Falls.

07:27.079 --> 07:30.276
Of course you did. We're 80 minutes to
the ocean, three hours to the mountains...

07:30.383 --> 07:34.319
six hours to New York City
and 20 hours to Zanzibar!

07:34.420 --> 07:38.652
When Communism fell,
I got job at first Moscow McDonald's.

07:38.758 --> 07:43.457
There I learned capitalist system-
Seize opportunity. Move up. Buy things.

07:43.563 --> 07:47.761
So I worked hard and moved up
to first Moscow Wendy's.

07:47.867 --> 07:51.030
Then up again
to first Moscow Burger King.

07:51.137 --> 07:55.164
There were dark times, like
when I work at first Moscow Hardee's.

07:57.276 --> 08:01.906
But my dream of living in
Langley Falls kept me alive.

08:02.014 --> 08:04.915
Sergei, that is so inspiring.

08:05.017 --> 08:07.884
At last, raccoons eat
your neighbor's face.

08:07.987 --> 08:10.012
Internet tells me
house is available.

08:10.122 --> 08:12.317
So I move to America.
Now look.

08:12.425 --> 08:14.916
I smoke your American
menthol cigarettes...

08:15.027 --> 08:17.222
and wear American
Winnie the Pooh sweatshirt.

08:17.330 --> 08:21.699
I support your New York Mets baseballs
and eat American Peeps candy.

08:21.801 --> 08:23.701
- Peep? Peep?
- Thanks!

08:23.803 --> 08:25.532
- I love these.
- Chewy!

08:25.638 --> 08:29.438
- Welcome to the neighborhood, Sergei.
- Put 'er there, American.

08:32.010 --> 08:34.070
Dude, my wife's right here, man.

08:37.683 --> 08:39.913
Why do you think she's smiling?

08:40.019 --> 08:43.147
I think it's a mother's smile.

08:43.256 --> 08:45.656
I think it's pride and love...

08:45.758 --> 08:49.057
and I think perhaps
she knew she'd be remembered.

08:50.696 --> 08:54.291
That Polish guy at the hostel
is gonna steal my towel. I just know it.

08:56.302 --> 08:58.896
Congratulations on locating Sergei.

08:59.005 --> 09:02.736
You're now officially the Deputy
Under-director of Missing Foreign Agents.

09:02.842 --> 09:08.303
So I was here, and now I'm here!
I've moved up at least an eighth of an inch!

09:08.414 --> 09:11.815
Yes. And since you're so good
at finding missing agents...

09:11.918 --> 09:14.284
it should be no problem
for you to find these 10.

09:14.387 --> 09:17.652
Find them all by next Friday,
and I'll give you another eighth of an inch.

09:17.757 --> 09:21.124
And I'll take that eighth of an inch, sir.
I'll take it like a man.

09:21.227 --> 09:23.457
- I know you will.
- Yeah, I will.

09:28.568 --> 09:31.298
D- Day, 1944.

09:31.404 --> 09:34.669
You think about the bravery,
the heroism that happened here.

09:34.774 --> 09:37.038
It's just... humbling.

09:37.143 --> 09:40.271
- Men younger than us. Boys, really.
- Just boys.

09:40.379 --> 09:42.711
Trying to fight off
an American invasion.

09:43.783 --> 09:46.251
L- I was talking about the Americans.

09:46.352 --> 09:48.718
Uh, the Germans were brave too.

09:48.821 --> 09:51.051
Less brave, maybe.

09:52.692 --> 09:55.286
Dad, wait. It's Saturday.
Can't you help me?

09:55.394 --> 09:58.454
Sorry, son.
Capitalism knows no Saturday.

09:58.564 --> 10:01.192
<i>Hello, neighbor!</i>

10:02.868 --> 10:04.802
That's a fine-looking flag, Sergei.

10:04.904 --> 10:07.930
Now you truly have everything
that makes someone an American.

10:08.040 --> 10:11.134
Almost.
I still need two things.

10:11.243 --> 10:14.701
A beer I am willing to fight for
and a job.

10:14.814 --> 10:17.942
Ajob, huh? How'd you like to
help my son with his model rocket?

10:18.050 --> 10:21.042
- Him?
- I would be proud to accept job...

10:21.153 --> 10:23.314
as child's model rocket assistant.

10:23.422 --> 10:26.516
Now, that's capitalism!

10:26.626 --> 10:29.618
Let us honor our arrangement
with Peeps.

10:37.536 --> 10:39.902
- What is this?
- That's a pinwheel.

10:40.006 --> 10:42.941
- What is this?
- That's Captain Ace Brogdale.

10:43.042 --> 10:45.010
He's sort of in charge of
the whole operation.

10:45.111 --> 10:47.102
Bit of a maverick.
Doesn't like taking orders.

10:47.213 --> 10:51.240
But he's got the guts to get the job done.

10:51.350 --> 10:54.183
- Ace!
- This rocket is decadent and wasteful.

10:54.286 --> 10:58.484
If you want to win contest,
your mind must be hard and joyless...

10:58.591 --> 11:00.491
like Russian turnip.

11:53.813 --> 11:56.281
- We just need something quick.
- We want to know what we're getting.

11:56.382 --> 11:58.816
We'll make it up.
We'll have a nice Italian meal for dinner.

11:58.918 --> 12:02.115
We're gonna have a nice
Italian meal for dinner.

12:04.056 --> 12:09.016
Yes, hi. Are you the spy known
as the Cairo puppet master?

12:09.128 --> 12:12.825
<i>- No? All right then.
- Stan, stop working and eat dinner with us.</i>

12:12.932 --> 12:16.095
I ordered from Meaty McMulligan's.
I hear it's awful.

12:16.202 --> 12:18.261
But if you don't like it
we'll just throw it out.

12:18.370 --> 12:20.998
<i>- Oh, that's so wasteful!
- Nonsense.</i>

12:21.107 --> 12:24.304
Your mom's enthusiastic spending
is exactly whatJesus had in mind...

12:24.410 --> 12:26.435
when he invented capitalism.

12:26.545 --> 12:29.514
Would any of you like
to hear my tribute poem?

12:29.615 --> 12:31.515
Tribute... to this food?

12:31.617 --> 12:35.917
No! For Mr. Halworthy!
For his funeral! It's tomorrow?

12:37.289 --> 12:39.951
You know what I don't care for?
Garlic fries.

12:40.059 --> 12:43.586
Are you people totally heartless?
Mr. Halworthy helped build this town...

12:43.696 --> 12:46.096
with the vision of
an all-white utopia, but still!

12:46.198 --> 12:47.961
Show some respect.

12:49.168 --> 12:52.160
She's right.
Garlic fries are awful.

12:52.271 --> 12:54.171
<i>- No, I said that.
- Oh!</i>

12:54.273 --> 12:56.173
Well, I guess Hayley disagrees.

12:56.275 --> 13:00.143
Anyway, my model rocket's coming along
great! Sergei's really helping me.

13:00.246 --> 13:02.680
Once we were foes
locked in a death struggle.

13:02.782 --> 13:06.513
Now he works for me!
Stalin's up in heaven cryin' his eyes out.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.917
I better get back to work.
Bullock's been riding me.

13:09.021 --> 13:11.717
Yeah, that sounds like
a typical complaint of the proletariat.

13:12.758 --> 13:15.192
<i>Did he just say " proletariat?"</i>

13:17.296 --> 13:19.287
I know you've embraced
our American system...

13:19.398 --> 13:22.390
but somehow my son
picked up a Communist word.

13:22.501 --> 13:24.992
You probably tossed it off.
Just an innocent mistake.

13:25.104 --> 13:30.508
Mistake, mmm.
Let me tell you a little story, Stan.

13:30.609 --> 13:34.067
<i>I truly believed in Communism,
Smith.</i>

13:34.180 --> 13:37.343
<i>And I was raising my son
to be a true party member.</i>

13:37.449 --> 13:40.646
<i>But then Communism fell,
and the wall came down.</i>

13:40.753 --> 13:45.520
<i>My wife, who had the strong,
plain features of a turnip, left me...</i>

13:45.624 --> 13:48.422
<i>for a West German
tennis equipment salesman.</i>

13:48.527 --> 13:51.894
<i>And my son, my young son...</i>

13:51.997 --> 13:55.023
<i>he became an entrepreneur.</i>

13:55.134 --> 13:58.399
He makes Halloween costumes
for dogs!

13:58.504 --> 14:00.495
But, what about McDonald's?

14:00.606 --> 14:03.734
Those were all lies to fool you.

14:03.843 --> 14:08.143
You see, I dreamed of coming
to Langley Falls, Stan.

14:08.247 --> 14:14.117
<i>Because I vowed, " The West stole my son,
so I will steal your son...</i>

14:14.220 --> 14:16.120
for Communism!"

14:16.222 --> 14:18.986
That'll never happen!
Steve's an American boy!

14:19.091 --> 14:23.027
He's made of my American juices,
baked in his mother's American oven!

14:24.063 --> 14:26.293
- Where's Steve?
- In his room. Why?

14:28.767 --> 14:31.065
- Which one's his room?
- On the right.

14:42.081 --> 14:45.414
Oh, my God!

14:45.517 --> 14:47.781
Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon!

14:49.688 --> 14:51.315
Dad.

14:51.423 --> 14:54.586
My son is a Communist!

15:02.268 --> 15:04.498
Stop it!
Sergei gave me that stuff!

15:04.603 --> 15:06.867
Look at this crazy
upside-down writing!

15:06.972 --> 15:10.100
I'll take my backwards letters
on a Toys"R"Us sign. Thank you very much.

15:10.209 --> 15:13.610
You're just a capitalist dupe!
All you care about is money!

15:13.712 --> 15:16.806
Sergei cares about me!
He helped me build my rocket!

15:19.518 --> 15:22.112
No more Sergei! That's an order!

15:23.455 --> 15:25.355
This, at least, we can agree on.

15:25.457 --> 15:27.357
<i>Planet of the Apes
was a fine picture.</i>

15:29.028 --> 15:32.759
- What's that?
- I'm just bringing dessert to my little astronaut.

15:32.865 --> 15:35.060
You mean cosmonaut!
No pie for him!

15:35.167 --> 15:39.433
- He's under sanctions! A pie embargo!
- Stan, don't be silly.

15:42.808 --> 15:45.504
<i>My God. He's defected!</i>

15:48.113 --> 15:51.173
Think, Steve, of how sweet
your turnips will taste...

15:51.283 --> 15:56.152
when this lean, sleek rocket
defeats your capitalist opponents.

16:10.269 --> 16:12.294
You're trying to bully me,
you imperialist pig!

16:12.404 --> 16:15.567
- Fascist!
- Steve, stop using words and listen to me.

16:15.674 --> 16:17.574
This is my fault.

16:17.676 --> 16:20.645
I was distracted by work,
and I let you fall into the wrong hands.

16:20.746 --> 16:23.943
And for that, I'm sorry.
You have a right to be mad at me.

16:24.049 --> 16:27.348
But don't be mad at capitalism.
Capitalism loves you!

16:27.453 --> 16:30.354
And it's gonna help us
win this rocket contest.

16:44.737 --> 16:48.173
<i># You can still
rock in America #</i>

16:48.273 --> 16:50.468
<i># Boy, yeah
It's all right #</i>

16:50.576 --> 16:53.602
<i># You can still
rock in America #</i>

16:53.712 --> 16:56.476
<i># Oh, yeah, all night #</i>

16:56.582 --> 16:59.517
<i># You can still
rock in America #</i>

16:59.618 --> 17:02.587
<i>- # You can still rock in America #
- Huh?</i>

17:02.688 --> 17:08.593
<i># You can still
rock in America ##</i>

17:23.709 --> 17:27.076
<i>Oh-ho! Mmm.</i>

17:29.248 --> 17:31.307
Okay, okay.
Th-That sign says Schaffhausen.

17:31.417 --> 17:33.317
Is that how you say it?
Schaffhausen?

17:33.419 --> 17:36.183
Yeah, I don't see Schaffhausen.
We want Winterthur.

17:36.288 --> 17:39.985
Well, I can't find it!

17:43.395 --> 17:46.091
We're going to Schaffhausen!

17:47.566 --> 17:50.433
<i>Do I even like girls? I must like girls.</i>

17:55.774 --> 17:58.140
Toshi, this is a rocket contest.

18:06.018 --> 18:08.646
<i>Good work, fellas.</i>

18:10.789 --> 18:14.088
You, I'm not paying. I'm pretty sure
you're the one who knocked over my Sprite.

18:16.195 --> 18:19.892
Look at this decadent monstrosity.

18:19.998 --> 18:24.298
I don't care what you think. Me and my dad
made this rocket, and it's awesome!

18:24.403 --> 18:28.635
Ha! It is bloated and overstuffed
like this fat child...

18:28.740 --> 18:31.106
with whom I will win space race.

18:31.210 --> 18:33.110
We will bury you!

18:33.212 --> 18:37.376
Today's rocket contest is a test of
thrust, force and precision-

18:37.483 --> 18:42.113
- The same skills you've been learning in sex ed.
- Ba-dum-bum.

18:42.221 --> 18:47.659
Whoever's rocket reaches the greatest altitude
and lands safely will be declared winner.

18:47.759 --> 18:49.989
Prepare to launch.
Three...

18:52.164 --> 18:54.689
two...

18:54.800 --> 18:57.132
one.

18:57.236 --> 18:59.170
Launch!

19:02.808 --> 19:05.174
Let's do it, Steve!

19:10.616 --> 19:13.016
Look! We're gonna win!

19:30.335 --> 19:32.803
We have a winner.
The fat kid!

19:32.905 --> 19:35.738
And his creepy Russian uncle
or whatever.

19:35.841 --> 19:39.641
L- I can't believe it.
We lost.

19:39.745 --> 19:44.341
After all the money I spent!
Capitalism let you down.

19:44.449 --> 19:48.909
- I... let you down.
- What? You didn't let me down.

19:49.021 --> 19:51.319
So, you don't care that we lost?

19:51.423 --> 19:54.654
All I really wanted
was to spend time with you.

19:54.760 --> 19:59.220
Congratulations, Smith.
You have bested me for your son's affection.

19:59.331 --> 20:02.789
You have won this cold battle,
but not the Cold War.

20:02.901 --> 20:05.927
I can see now
that I rushed my revenge.

20:06.038 --> 20:10.407
Perhaps it was the haste of a man who
longed to take his revenge like his vodka-

20:10.509 --> 20:12.704
In one dreadful swallow.

20:12.811 --> 20:15.336
But I see now I must take my time.

20:15.447 --> 20:19.440
I will plant seeds of revenge
and let them grow.

20:19.551 --> 20:23.009
Then I'll harvest
the vegetables of revenge.

20:23.121 --> 20:26.454
And from those vegetables,
I will plant more seeds.

20:26.558 --> 20:29.891
- And then you'll get your revenge?
- No, Smith.

20:29.995 --> 20:34.091
From the third, or perhaps fourth
harvest of revenge plants...

20:34.199 --> 20:38.465
I will make a vegetable stew,
and season it perfectly...

20:38.570 --> 20:40.936
with revenge!

20:42.774 --> 20:46.835
U.S. A! U.S. A! U.S. A! U.S. A!

20:58.090 --> 21:01.423
It was awesome, Mom!
We blew the other rockets away!

21:01.526 --> 21:06.623
That's great, honey. I just wish your father
didn't spend our entire savings on it.

21:06.732 --> 21:10.099
- Well, you gotta spend money to make money.
- But you didn't make any money.

21:10.202 --> 21:13.194
Then, by that logic, I didn't spend any.
Good night, everybody.

21:22.447 --> 21:24.540
What do you want, Sergei?

21:24.650 --> 21:28.984
Did you notice your showerhead
was on the pulse setting this morning?

21:29.087 --> 21:30.281
No.

21:30.389 --> 21:33.552
That was a mere appetizer
at the banquet of my revenge!

21:37.596 --> 21:38.995
Is that all?

21:39.097 --> 21:42.897
Some of your mail got delivered
to my house. It looked important.

21:43.001 --> 21:44.468
Thanks, neighbor.

21:44.569 --> 21:46.469
Bye! Have a beautiful time!
