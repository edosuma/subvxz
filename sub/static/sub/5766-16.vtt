WEBVTT

00:01.800 --> 00:03.427
WENDY:
I had a nanny for five years.

00:03.470 --> 00:06.667
I loved her.
My kids loved her.

00:06.700 --> 00:09.999
I failed to do my due diligence,
that's all.

00:11.540 --> 00:14.100
I didn't know she was an illegal
immigrant.

00:14.140 --> 00:18.099
I also didn't know I would be
running for this office.

00:18.150 --> 00:21.119
MODERATOR:
Mr. Childs, 30 seconds.

00:21.150 --> 00:23.186
GLENN:
With all due respect,
that just doesn't wash.

00:23.220 --> 00:25.142
You want my job--
a job that judges whether others

00:25.190 --> 00:27.158
have broken_ the law--
and you've Just spent

00:27.190 --> 00:29.158
the past five years
breaking the law.
Yes!

00:29.190 --> 00:30.589
(cheering)
Look at her
negatives.

00:30.630 --> 00:33.190
Now, you can't just say
"Oops! My bad."

00:33.230 --> 00:34.549
You broke the law, ma'am.

00:34.600 --> 00:35.692
They don't like Wendy, but they
don't like Childs

00:35.730 --> 00:38.528
criticizing her.
MODERATOR: Mr. Florrick,
30 seconds.

00:38.570 --> 00:40.128
Come on, come on.
Stick to the script.

00:40.170 --> 00:42.832
The youth vote. The youth vote.

00:42.870 --> 00:44.406
This is our last debate.

00:44.440 --> 00:47.079
In six weeks you're going
to be voting.

00:47.110 --> 00:49.340
So I want to address the young
people in our audience.
(people cheer)

00:49.380 --> 00:50.802
Listening to us, lately,

00:50.850 --> 00:52.670
you might think
politics is all about

00:52.720 --> 00:55.177
shouting and finger-pointing,
but I want you

00:55.220 --> 00:56.118
to remember this...
Look,
look, look.

00:56.150 --> 00:58.289
You are the future.

00:58.320 --> 00:59.810
Come on. Prison, prison!

00:59.860 --> 01:02.078
Your hopes, your dreams...
I know from my time in prison

01:02.130 --> 01:04.553
that what we do here matters.
(people cheer)

01:04.590 --> 01:08.151
I'm a mother first,
an activist second.

01:08.200 --> 01:10.794
What I did,
I did for my daughters.

01:10.830 --> 01:14.493
And I think it's hypocritical
for these two men

01:14.540 --> 01:17.202
to stand up here and act as if
(telephone rings)

01:17.240 --> 01:19.674
they know the struggles of
a working mom.
Alicia Florrick.

01:19.710 --> 01:21.132
WILL: What're you
worried about?

01:21.180 --> 01:22.807
You're up by three votes.

01:22.850 --> 01:25.444
DERRICK:
That's what I'm worried about.
Three votes.

01:25.480 --> 01:27.471
This Friday?
That's the plan.

01:29.250 --> 01:30.444
DERRICK:
Do you have the contracts?

01:30.490 --> 01:33.857
Actually, I need Alicia
in my deposition.

01:37.160 --> 01:39.196
It's all coming down.

01:39.230 --> 01:41.198
Tensions are high.
Over...?

01:41.230 --> 01:43.869
Partners' meeting. Friday.
Look, I know it's last minute,

01:43.900 --> 01:46.164
but I need you in these
depositions.

01:46.200 --> 01:47.462
ALICIA:
What is it?
Internet surt.

01:47.500 --> 01:49.309
Just dropped into our lap.
We're suing

01:49.340 --> 01:50.739
the search engine Chumhum.

01:50.770 --> 01:51.737
They don't want to go to court,

01:51.770 --> 01:53.499
so we're trying to scare them
into a settlement.

01:53.540 --> 01:55.235
Just look angry and intense.

01:55.280 --> 01:56.440
I can do that.

01:56.480 --> 01:58.141
It was a Thursday.

01:58.180 --> 02:01.240
I had just come home, uh,
from classes.

02:01.280 --> 02:02.713
Very late.

02:02.750 --> 02:04.479
VIOLA:
Now, Mr. Shen Yuan,

02:04.520 --> 02:06.317
when you've discussed this
in the past...
DIANE: Excuse me,

02:06.360 --> 02:08.658
don't you want to hear
the rest of his answer?

02:08.690 --> 02:11.227
Oh, certainly.

02:11.260 --> 02:14.491
Please continue.
Would you like...?

02:14.530 --> 02:18.466
Um, I-I teach at
Beijing Hongwu University...

02:18.500 --> 02:21.162
Sorry, I-I taught-taught at.

02:21.200 --> 02:23.839
I was working on
notes for a lecture.

02:23.870 --> 02:25.838
It was

02:25.870 --> 02:28.202
10:00 at night,
and the phone rang.

02:28.240 --> 02:29.946
It was a voice I didn't know.

02:29.980 --> 02:31.675
He said, "Are you home?"

02:31.710 --> 02:33.712
Uh, I laughed.

02:33.750 --> 02:35.672
I said, "Yes, of course."

02:35.720 --> 02:37.711
And he hung up.

02:37.750 --> 02:40.218
I thought it was
a wrong number.

02:40.260 --> 02:41.682
Then I was saying

02:41.720 --> 02:43.779
good night to my wife.

02:43.830 --> 02:48.199
And, um, I-I remember,

02:48.230 --> 02:50.790
I-I started to-to say,

02:50.830 --> 02:53.196
"Do you think Tolstoy died
happy?"

02:53.240 --> 02:57.199
But before I finished,

02:57.240 --> 02:59.800
the door broke open

02:59.840 --> 03:02.673
and ten a-agents

03:02.710 --> 03:03.972
came in-- Guo an bu--

03:04.010 --> 03:05.978
g-government agents.

03:06.010 --> 03:09.685
They threw me on the floor,

03:09.720 --> 03:12.359
bound my feet, hands,

03:12.390 --> 03:15.450
and took me away in my
nightclothes.

03:15.490 --> 03:19.449
This was in 2004.

03:19.500 --> 03:22.298
I didn't see
my wife again

03:22.330 --> 03:24.469
until last year.

03:25.500 --> 03:26.899
I was, uh,

03:26.940 --> 03:29.329
imprisoned in
Beijing Prison #9,

03:29.370 --> 03:32.771
_ _ accused of_
mating subversron.

03:32.810 --> 03:37.702
You see, I-I had sent
a-a blog entry,

03:37.750 --> 03:41.311
and I had sent it to a friend
here, in Chicago.

03:41.350 --> 03:46.481
And I had argued to him that
democracy would come to China.

03:46.520 --> 03:49.489
And how did you know that this
was the reason for your arrest?

03:49.530 --> 03:51.259
How-how did I know?

03:51.290 --> 03:53.292
Yes. There's no_
record of your trIal

03:53.330 --> 03:54.957
or your arrest warrant.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.299
How do you know that it wasn't
someone just informing on you?

03:58.330 --> 04:00.798
Because the security men
who tortured me

04:00.840 --> 04:02.865
for the next three weeks
told me so.

04:07.980 --> 04:10.448
Why not the
Chinese authorities?

04:10.480 --> 04:13.449
I do... I do blame
the Chinese authorities,

04:13.480 --> 04:16.040
but I used your
social media Web site.

04:16.080 --> 04:22.326
I trusted my writings
to remain anonymous.

04:22.360 --> 04:24.282
But Chumhum gave my IP address
to the police.

04:24.330 --> 04:26.298
It's the only reason

04:26.330 --> 04:30.892
why I was arrested, imprisoned
and tortured for five years.

04:30.930 --> 04:32.693
DIANE:
$28 million.

04:32.740 --> 04:34.833
And an agreement
to not turn over

04:34.870 --> 04:37.009
any more names to the
Chinese authorities.

04:37.040 --> 04:38.962
Mmm... no.

04:39.010 --> 04:40.432
Okay, then, what else
do we have to talk about?

04:40.480 --> 04:43.301
Your cookies?
Chumhum is a
worldwide company,

04:43.350 --> 04:44.999
like Yahoo, Google, Facebook.

04:45.050 --> 04:47.644
We do business in Canada,
Mexico, China,

04:47.680 --> 04:49.341
even... Easter Island.

04:49.390 --> 04:51.847
We have to follow the laws of
each individual country.

04:51.890 --> 04:52.914
That's your defense?

04:52.960 --> 04:54.052
That's part of our defense.

04:54.090 --> 04:56.058
And, uh, human rights,
they don't matter?

04:56.090 --> 04:57.853
Uh, what human rights?

04:57.890 --> 05:00.029
One person's freedom fighter is
another person's terrorist.

05:00.060 --> 05:01.925
Shen Yuan, as
sympathetic
as he is,

05:01.960 --> 05:04.428
broke his country's laws.

05:04.470 --> 05:05.494
We didn't make those laws.

05:05.530 --> 05:07.760
In fact, if we hadn't handed
over his IP address,

05:07.800 --> 05:09.336
we would've been
breaking theIr laws.

05:09.370 --> 05:13.079
Yeah. Ask Yahoo how well
that defense worked.

05:13.110 --> 05:14.429
Yahoo never went to court.

05:14.480 --> 05:16.368
Yep. They paid up, instead.

05:16.410 --> 05:18.048
Now we're talking.

05:18.080 --> 05:19.877
Lower your ask.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.069
No, I don't think so.

05:21.120 --> 05:23.384
All right, then consider this.

05:23.420 --> 05:25.615
Chumhum could not have
anticipated

05:25.650 --> 05:27.356
the repercussions of our
actions.

05:27.390 --> 05:29.756
(laughs)
(chuckles)

05:29.790 --> 05:31.621
WILL:
Yeah, that's it.

05:31.660 --> 05:33.423
The Chinese just wanted
his IP address

05:33.460 --> 05:34.529
_ to throw him
a lIttle surprise party.

05:34.560 --> 05:35.959
We'll be back.
(Viola chuckles)

05:40.100 --> 05:41.397
Oh, I have a pen.

05:41.440 --> 05:42.702
Do you want me to sign it?

05:42.740 --> 05:44.469
Excuse me?

05:44.510 --> 05:45.761
Your behind.

05:50.780 --> 05:52.475
Do you want me to sign it?

05:53.720 --> 05:55.369
They want to argue that they
didn't know

05:55.420 --> 05:57.945
handing over Shen's IP
address would result

05:57.990 --> 05:59.787
in his arrest
and torture.
So you need
to dig through

05:59.820 --> 06:02.118
all of Chumhum's writings,
public statements,

06:02.160 --> 06:04.151
anything that
contradicts that.
Got It.

06:04.190 --> 06:07.523
Heading out for... that...
divorce case

06:10.170 --> 06:11.489
Do you need help
with something else?

06:11.530 --> 06:12.861
We're fine. Thanks.

06:12.900 --> 06:13.867
DAVID:
We're like

06:13.900 --> 06:15.697
homeless lavwers.

06:15.740 --> 06:17.002
WILL:
So, the vote is this Friday.

06:17.040 --> 06:19.702
Bond... is up
by three votes.

06:19.740 --> 06:21.401
One of them
is supposedly me.

06:21.440 --> 06:22.668
So, really
he's only up by one.

06:22.710 --> 06:24.405
By two.
No, by one.

06:26.450 --> 06:28.714
He loses your vote, that's
one vote. He's up by two.

06:28.750 --> 06:30.741
No. I move to Diane's side,
so she

06:30.790 --> 06:32.587
gains one and he
loses one.
Wh-What're you
talking about?

06:32.620 --> 06:34.451
What I'm talking about is I
don't have time to...

06:34.490 --> 06:36.458
Just agree we need
more votes!
_ That's
rldlCUIOUS!

06:36.490 --> 06:37.627
We need more votes,

06:37.660 --> 06:38.581
and we're running out
of time.

06:38.630 --> 06:41.155
Julius, where are we
on turning Fitzpatrick?

06:41.200 --> 06:43.065
Still talking to him.
Nothing definite yet.

06:43.100 --> 06:44.226
Well, what have
you been doing?

06:44.270 --> 06:45.999
What have I...? You know,
in case you haven't noticed,

06:46.030 --> 06:47.736
I have a job.

06:47.770 --> 06:48.737
Yeah, excuse me.

06:48.770 --> 06:50.431
This is not_
a smoking section.

06:50.470 --> 06:51.505
This is a secret section.

06:51.540 --> 06:53.201
Walk away!
Walk away!

06:53.240 --> 06:54.832
We still have to talk
about how all this

06:54.880 --> 06:57.440
is going to
shake out.
Oh... here we go.

06:57.480 --> 06:58.572
Yeah. Here we go.

06:58.610 --> 07:01.477
I want some assurances about the
mInorIty hIrIng program.

07:01.520 --> 07:02.817
If he gets one more assurance,
I swear to God...

07:02.850 --> 07:04.112
Okay, okay!
You know,I'm
not sure...

07:04.150 --> 07:06.038
We're all going to benefit
if we get Bond out.

07:06.090 --> 07:07.557
So can we just
hold it together

07:07.590 --> 07:08.989
for one more
week, please?!

07:09.020 --> 07:10.055
But no more meetings outside.

07:10.090 --> 07:13.821
I walk away from this vent
smelling like spaghetti.

07:13.860 --> 07:15.521
DIANE:
What do you think?

07:15.560 --> 07:18.996
I think it's not exactly the
Continental Congress,

07:19.030 --> 07:20.861
but all we need to do
is switch one vote.

07:20.900 --> 07:23.039
Or... add two.

07:24.970 --> 07:28.098
Remember when our firms were
brought together, under Stern?

07:28.140 --> 07:30.506
You're not thinking about
bringing Stern back, are you?

07:30.550 --> 07:33.610
Because I'd really rather...
No, his gang of
three. Remember?

07:34.680 --> 07:37.080
The alter kockers?
Yes.
We needed

07:37.120 --> 07:39.486
to keep them on the rolls
per Stern's contract.

07:39.520 --> 07:42.080
They didn't have to
come in to work,

07:42.120 --> 07:44.588
but we sent them
the quarterly reports, and...

07:44.630 --> 07:47.599
They're still
equity partners.

07:48.900 --> 07:51.596
They're dead, aren't they?
They have to be dead.

07:51.630 --> 07:54.497
One of them is dead.
Two of them...

07:54.540 --> 07:55.962
aren't.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.036
(laughing)

07:58.070 --> 08:01.233
Every statement made by every
board member of Chumhum,

08:01.280 --> 08:04.602
and not a single one mentions
China.

08:05.680 --> 08:07.773
What's this?
Change
of address.

08:07.820 --> 08:10.288
For who?
Me.

08:10.320 --> 08:13.255
Uh, I don't... think I even have
your old address.

08:13.290 --> 08:15.110
Well, now you have my new one.

08:17.160 --> 08:19.219
I feel like we've grown closer
together.

08:19.260 --> 08:20.727
Okay, give it back.

08:20.760 --> 08:22.296
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

08:22.330 --> 08:24.719
This is going in my copy of
Eat, Pray, Love.

08:25.600 --> 08:27.591
Ow!
Sorry.

08:27.640 --> 08:29.164
(cell phone beeps)
Ow...

08:29.200 --> 08:30.633
Peter did well
in his debate today.

08:30.670 --> 08:32.774
Yeah, I know.
Do you want him to win?

08:32.810 --> 08:33.879
Yes.

08:33.910 --> 08:36.947
I just don't want to go back
to the way things were.

08:36.980 --> 08:38.538
Well, why would they?

08:38.580 --> 08:40.616
I don't know. Life.

08:40.650 --> 08:43.619
Zach. I just got Dad's text.
Everything good?

08:43.650 --> 08:44.719
Yeah.

08:44.750 --> 08:47.218
I'm going to be another hour.
Yeah, I'll tell him.

08:47.260 --> 08:48.989
I love you.

08:49.020 --> 08:50.328
All right, love you, too.
PETER:
Wendy's not out. She's hurt.

08:50.360 --> 08:52.590
But she's not out.
Oh, come on!

08:52.630 --> 08:53.892
I don't want to hear
anything discouraging!

08:53.930 --> 08:55.852
You slaughtered them!
Okay, but...

08:55.900 --> 08:57.822
_ No "buts_"!
Give us a mInute

08:57.870 --> 08:59.565
to feel good
about this, huh?
No, no, no, no. Wait.

08:59.600 --> 09:01.659
I-I want to hear this.
Go ahead.
Well, women
sympathize

09:01.700 --> 09:02.928
with her, with Wendy.

09:02.970 --> 09:04.232
Over Nannygate.

09:04.270 --> 09:06.329
Ithoughtso.
And she gave a good closing.

09:06.370 --> 09:07.598
It's a very good closing.

09:07.640 --> 09:08.629
I don't think we killed her.

09:08.680 --> 09:10.045
I think she stays in the race.

09:10.080 --> 09:12.344
Well, let her. She's injured.
She'll limp along.

09:12.380 --> 09:14.814
What about Childs? You find out
anything about his nanny?

09:14.850 --> 09:16.579
Yeah.
Swedish au pair.

09:16.620 --> 09:17.746
All paid up.
Everything legal.

09:17.790 --> 09:19.587
PETER:
Hmm.
ELI: But, hey! We're back

09:19.620 --> 09:21.713
from the grave.
We have money coming in,

09:21.760 --> 09:23.227
we'll start buying air time.

09:23.260 --> 09:25.353
With six weeks left?
Yeah.

09:25.390 --> 09:26.482
I don't think so.

09:26.530 --> 09:29.624
We needed to make this
a two-man race, and we didn't.

09:29.670 --> 09:31.626
But it was a good day.

09:31.670 --> 09:32.796
It was.

09:32.840 --> 09:36.662
And a good race. Gentlemen...

09:36.710 --> 09:38.632
Thank you.

09:38.670 --> 09:41.275
It was an_ honor
servmg With you.

09:41.310 --> 09:44.245
Hi, Becca? Yeah. I was just...
wondering, do you still have

09:44.280 --> 09:45.770
those photos from drama camp?

09:48.250 --> 09:49.615
No, it's important.

10:03.970 --> 10:06.962
Neil Gross.
I'm CEO of Chumhum.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.365
So you're the reason

10:08.400 --> 10:10.061
Shen Yuan was imprisoned
and tortured?

10:10.110 --> 10:11.930
No. You'll have to subpoena

10:11.970 --> 10:14.404
the Chinese authorities
for that.
But _
you supplied

10:14.440 --> 10:17.648
the Chinese authorities with
Mr. Yuan's IP address.

10:17.680 --> 10:19.204
Yes, which we were
forced to do.

10:19.250 --> 10:20.808
If the US.
government forced us

10:20.850 --> 10:24.741
to supply the IP addresses of a
child pornographer,

10:24.790 --> 10:27.213
we would do_ the same.
Wait,
so you're equating

10:27.260 --> 10:30.980
a Chinese dissident
with a child pornographer?

10:31.030 --> 10:33.021
Mmm... no.

10:33.060 --> 10:35.654
I don't think any fair analysis
of our exchange

10:35.700 --> 10:38.419
would conclude that, but...
nice try.

10:38.470 --> 10:43.305
WILL: Isn't the motto of your
company "First, do no wrong"?

10:43.340 --> 10:45.433
Yes, it is.
Do you
believe

10:45.470 --> 10:48.405
you "did no wrong"
when you turned

10:48.440 --> 10:50.943
Mr. Yuan's information over to
the Chinese?

10:50.980 --> 10:54.313
I believe "wrong" is best
avoided by being open.

10:54.350 --> 10:56.784
"Information wants
to be free."

10:56.820 --> 10:59.015
So to speak.
Information
wants to be free,

10:59.050 --> 11:02.258
but people want to go to jail?

11:02.290 --> 11:04.850
We had no foreknowledge
of what the Chinese would do

11:04.890 --> 11:07.029
with the supplied
IP addresses.

11:07.060 --> 11:08.152
How old are you?

11:08.200 --> 11:10.794
GROSS:
Me, why?

11:10.830 --> 11:12.058
Because I'm asking you a
question in a deposition.

11:12.100 --> 11:16.389
Oh. I'm 50. How old are you?

11:16.440 --> 11:19.466
Don't you think it's a little
old to be wearing a hoodie?

11:19.510 --> 11:21.978
VIOLA:
Is there any point to this line

11:22.010 --> 11:23.705
of questioning, other than to
offend?

11:23.750 --> 11:25.103
Not really, actually.

11:25.150 --> 11:27.209
It's okay, Vi. It's all good.

11:27.250 --> 11:29.241
I think hoodies are practical.

11:29.280 --> 11:31.111
I think they help brand
a lifestyle.

11:31.150 --> 11:34.051
And I thinkI make more in an
hour than you make in a year.

11:34.090 --> 11:37.389
That help you?
Yes, it does, actually.

11:37.430 --> 11:39.955
Uh, how many IP addresses of
dissidents

11:40.000 --> 11:42.252
have you supplied to the Chinese
authorities?

11:42.300 --> 11:43.927
I don't know.
Not more than 50.

11:45.270 --> 11:47.795
(marimba cell phone ringtone)
Not more than 50?

11:47.840 --> 11:49.865
(sighs)

11:51.010 --> 11:53.171
I...

11:58.350 --> 12:02.013
I think_that number...
surprised someone

12:02.050 --> 12:04.018
who was in prison and tortured
for five years.

12:04.050 --> 12:07.850
Look, um, I don't think
you understand.

12:07.890 --> 12:11.189
If the US. government thinks we
should not be doing business

12:11.230 --> 12:15.326
in China, then they have one
simple remedy: outlaw it.

12:15.360 --> 12:17.521
Like they do in Cuba,
but they don't do that.

12:17.570 --> 12:20.095
And you know why?
I think
I know what you'll argue.

12:20.140 --> 12:23.337
Becau_se American businesses in
China help open the door.

12:23.370 --> 12:25.031
Just a little bit.

12:25.070 --> 12:26.879
We... let the light in.

12:26.910 --> 12:28.502
WILL: It also doesn't hurt
that we owe them

12:28.540 --> 12:30.804
$843 billion, does it?

12:30.850 --> 12:32.101
GROSS:
Guess I'm a lot less

12:32.150 --> 12:34.015
cynical than you, because
I think we're changing

12:34.050 --> 12:35.449
the face of Chinese society.

12:35.480 --> 12:37.539
Look what happened
in Egypt.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.785
(sighs) What?
You
attended

12:39.820 --> 12:41.219
Stanford University,
is that correct?

12:41.260 --> 12:42.409
Yes, I did.

12:42.460 --> 12:43.882
Oh, I wore a hoodie there, too.

12:43.930 --> 12:47.525
In your Comparative Religions
class in 1984,

12:47.560 --> 12:49.994
did you write a paper about the
arrest

12:50.030 --> 12:52.089
and torture of Tibetan
actIVIsts?

12:58.940 --> 13:00.100
(sighs)

13:00.140 --> 13:02.176
Are you all right?

13:02.210 --> 13:05.543
The guard who took the most
pleasure

13:05.580 --> 13:09.573
in my water... treatment--

13:09.620 --> 13:13.886
it is simulated drowning--

13:13.920 --> 13:17.583
he had a cell phone
in his pocket.

13:17.630 --> 13:20.895
And it would ring,
and he would stop.

13:22.030 --> 13:23.497
It's the same ring.

13:25.030 --> 13:27.567
I hear it everywhere.

13:27.600 --> 13:29.238
Sorry.
When-whenever I hear it,

13:29.270 --> 13:31.204
I think of that.

13:31.240 --> 13:34.505
It's an odd way
to walk through life.

13:34.540 --> 13:36.872
(footsteps)

13:36.910 --> 13:40.311
My worry is they will
offer money,

13:40.350 --> 13:43.945
and not stop this practice.

13:45.890 --> 13:48.313
$865,000.
(Diane laughs)

13:48.360 --> 13:50.851
Really? Your
CEO makes more

13:50.890 --> 13:52.448
in an hour than I make
in a year,

13:52.490 --> 13:54.299
and he wants to offer...
Direct damages.

13:54.330 --> 13:56.548
Lost wages. The wife's loss of
companionship.

13:56.600 --> 13:58.898
Adjusted for inflation.
Our legal department

13:58.930 --> 14:00.898
looked into it; found no
reason for punitive.

14:00.940 --> 14:01.838
No pain and suffering?

14:01.870 --> 14:04.930
Not that would warrant more than
$865,000.

14:04.970 --> 14:07.006
What do you have?

14:08.040 --> 14:09.576
What do you think I have?

14:09.610 --> 14:11.874
So, what?
"Lack of foreknowledge" didn't

14:11.910 --> 14:14.913
work for you, so now you're
gonna go after Shen Yuan?

14:14.950 --> 14:16.986
Why not Nelson Mandela?
Vaclav Havel?

14:17.020 --> 14:18.339
See you tomorrow.

14:22.160 --> 14:25.288
A bluff? Or what?

14:26.490 --> 14:27.923
You're kidding.
I'm not.

14:27.960 --> 14:31.418
Zach looks exactly
like his dad.

14:31.470 --> 14:33.438
Oh, Zach!

14:33.470 --> 14:35.438
There you are.

14:35.470 --> 14:38.109
_ Jackie and _I
were just haVIng a little chat.

14:38.140 --> 14:40.370
Hi.
Well,

14:40.410 --> 14:42.469
I'll let you two get to it.

14:42.510 --> 14:44.546
I'm really glad we got to talk,
Jackie.
Mm-hmm.

14:48.950 --> 14:50.315
What are you doing with my
grandmother?

14:50.350 --> 14:52.341
Nothing, she was already here.

14:52.390 --> 14:54.312
She's actually pretty cool.

14:54.360 --> 14:57.158
Cool skips a generation,
didn't you know that?

14:57.190 --> 14:59.055
No. It doesn't.

14:59.090 --> 15:02.423
So these are the pictures of
Glenn, Jr. at drama camp.

15:02.460 --> 15:03.666
What're you looking for?

15:03.700 --> 15:05.463
My dad's trying to prove

15:05.500 --> 15:06.933
that Glenn Childs never paid
his nanny.

15:06.970 --> 15:09.131
They said it was
a Swedish au pair.

15:09.170 --> 15:10.467
But I thought I saw
in your pictures...

15:10.510 --> 15:11.704
Wait. Stop.

15:11.740 --> 15:14.300
If that's his nanny,

15:14.340 --> 15:16.570
she's not Swedish.

15:16.610 --> 15:19.602
We think they'll try to show
Shen Yuan wasn't tortured.

15:19.650 --> 15:21.413
DIANE (over speaker):
Really, any idea how?

15:21.450 --> 15:22.712
Well, my guess is

15:22.750 --> 15:24.513
they'll get a Chinese official
on their witness list

15:24.550 --> 15:26.086
to insist there was no torture.

15:26.120 --> 15:28.714
So we need to line up
dissidents to refute it.

15:28.760 --> 15:30.728
Well, okay. I'll be out of
contact for an hour,

15:30.760 --> 15:33.126
so keep me in touch. Mm-hmm.

15:33.160 --> 15:35.219
Sorry about that.
No,

15:35.260 --> 15:36.352
take your time.
Yeah.

15:36.400 --> 15:38.061
We don't mind sitting
here, waiting.

15:38.100 --> 15:41.263
Well, as I was saying,
we want you back.

15:42.440 --> 15:45.364
Back for the next_
eqUIty partner meeting.

15:45.410 --> 15:47.071
What do we get?

15:47.110 --> 15:49.431
Well, um, office space.

15:49.480 --> 15:51.698
And a seat at the table.

15:51.750 --> 15:53.342
And year-end bonuses?

15:53.380 --> 15:54.347
What, next-year bonuses?

15:54.380 --> 15:56.211
No, no, no.
This year.

15:56.250 --> 15:58.639
I said "ice cream,"
you stupid bitch.

15:58.690 --> 16:00.180
How many times
do I have to say it?
(utensil clanks)

16:00.220 --> 16:03.678
Um, would...

16:03.730 --> 16:06.381
you want year-end bonuses for a
year that you didn't work?

16:06.430 --> 16:08.751
You're paying for our wisdom.

16:08.800 --> 16:11.428
LYMAN: You want
our votes, right?

16:11.470 --> 16:12.619
You want both our votes?

16:12.670 --> 16:14.035
Yes.

16:14.070 --> 16:16.095
Then we have terms.

16:16.140 --> 16:18.131
(car horn blares)
KALIN DA:
Cary.

16:18.170 --> 16:20.570
What are you doing here?

16:20.610 --> 16:22.737
CARY:
So a change of address
notice, huh?

16:22.780 --> 16:25.169
Why is that seen
as such a revelation?

16:25.210 --> 16:26.746
Hey, I'm just saying
I have one.

16:26.780 --> 16:28.111
I moved.

16:28.150 --> 16:30.983
Good for you.

16:34.790 --> 16:36.382
Cary...
What?

16:36.420 --> 16:39.082
I like you,
it's just...

16:41.330 --> 16:42.649
it's just,
you know...
I'm not here

16:42.700 --> 16:44.622
for anything other than to tell
you something.

16:44.670 --> 16:48.299
A grand jury is being impaneled,
looking into you.

16:49.340 --> 16:51.467
Specifically into me?

16:51.510 --> 16:52.659
Well...

16:52.710 --> 16:55.304
supposedly it's about corrupt
practices

16:55.340 --> 16:57.046
by defense investigators, but,
yeah".

16:57.080 --> 16:59.708
Childs is focusing in on you;
readying an indictment.

17:03.590 --> 17:04.545
VVhen?

17:04.590 --> 17:07.013
It's next week.

17:08.090 --> 17:09.557
We're lining up witnesses
and exhibits.

17:09.590 --> 17:11.228
Can you tell me who?

17:11.260 --> 17:15.151
Hmm...

17:15.200 --> 17:16.519
No.

17:16.560 --> 17:19.393
I shouldn't be
telling you this much.

17:21.100 --> 17:23.159
Cary.

17:24.670 --> 17:27.173
Why did you send me a change of
address notice, anyway?

17:27.210 --> 17:30.407
I don't know. It just...

17:30.450 --> 17:32.179
It just felt normal.

17:35.580 --> 17:37.684
You're trying to be normal?

17:37.720 --> 17:41.508
Sure. I like normal.

17:52.400 --> 17:55.267
Welcome back to normal.

18:02.840 --> 18:04.398
WOMAN: Florrick for
State's Attorney.

18:04.450 --> 18:05.872
How may I direct
your call?

18:05.910 --> 18:07.548
Well, look who we
have here today.

18:07.580 --> 18:08.842
Ah! Hello, Mr. Gold.

18:08.880 --> 18:10.541
I come in peace.

18:10.590 --> 18:12.387
Mm-hmm. Like Yasser Arafat?

18:12.420 --> 18:14.308
Are you maybe confusing
my office

18:14.360 --> 18:16.112
with the free clinic down
the street?

18:16.160 --> 18:18.287
Zach! Look! I found him.

18:18.330 --> 18:20.195
Eli. How're you doing?

18:20.230 --> 18:23.290
We have something
to show you.
Zach has
something to show you.

18:24.900 --> 18:25.764
ZACH:
You said

18:25.800 --> 18:28.166
that Childs paid
the Swedish nanny in full.

18:28.200 --> 18:30.509
If that's the case,
then who's this?

18:30.540 --> 18:34.203
She's not Swedish. I mean,
look at her, she's black.

18:34.240 --> 18:36.333
And Becca saw her bring
Childs' son to drama camp.

18:36.380 --> 18:38.507
Do you see?

18:38.550 --> 18:40.768
I see. Thank you.

18:40.820 --> 18:43.789
Then why are you not...

18:43.820 --> 18:45.685
I mean, this is good, right?

18:45.720 --> 18:48.689
You need
to, like...
I need to what?

18:48.720 --> 18:51.154
I don't know. Look into it?

18:51.190 --> 18:52.782
What's wrong?

18:52.830 --> 18:55.321
What's wrong is that
Eli doesn't trust me.

18:55.360 --> 18:59.262
No. This is... interesting.

18:59.300 --> 19:01.188
See?

19:01.240 --> 19:03.231
I'm interested.

19:03.270 --> 19:05.704
Could you just give me
one moment?

19:11.680 --> 19:14.649
(muffled grunting)

19:14.680 --> 19:16.511
(sighs)

19:20.790 --> 19:22.917
Look, I'm going
to tell my dad.
Is there any way you have

19:22.960 --> 19:25.178
of finding out
this nanny's name?

19:25.230 --> 19:26.219
Maybe.

19:26.260 --> 19:28.455
Then that would be helpful.

19:29.500 --> 19:31.821
Great. We're on it.

19:31.870 --> 19:33.861
Thanks.

19:38.340 --> 19:39.705
(sighs)

19:42.240 --> 19:44.845
I am the smartest person I know.

19:44.880 --> 19:47.212
No, you can't have
a corner office!

19:47.250 --> 19:50.515
Because there are no corner
offices left!

19:50.550 --> 19:52.347
The alter kockers?

19:52.390 --> 19:53.414
They're killing me.

19:53.460 --> 19:54.984
(whispers):
Deposition.
No!

19:55.020 --> 19:57.352
I got to go.

19:57.390 --> 19:58.823
Then get out your rolodex!

19:58.860 --> 20:01.294
See what other firm
will hire you!

20:03.600 --> 20:04.521
What do we have?

20:04.570 --> 20:06.959
Amnesty International,
and two dissidents.

20:07.000 --> 20:07.989
From the same prison?

20:08.040 --> 20:09.234
The exact same prison.

20:09.270 --> 20:11.864
Excuse me.
If you don't mind,

20:11.910 --> 20:13.832
I'd like to add a new witness to
the witness list.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.905
To testify Shen Yuan
wasn't tortured?

20:15.940 --> 20:16.975
Among other things.

20:17.010 --> 20:18.978
I'm sure you'll find it
illuminating.

20:19.010 --> 20:20.511
WILL:
I'm sure I will, too.

20:20.550 --> 20:22.347
And we'll spend the afternoon
subpoenaing

20:22.380 --> 20:23.779
and cross-examining dueling
experts.

20:28.990 --> 20:29.979
Jinghua.

20:32.290 --> 20:33.655
Who's that?

20:36.830 --> 20:39.298
It's... my wife.

20:48.610 --> 20:49.975
(door closes)
Okay. It's just the two of us.

20:50.010 --> 20:51.807
No one's listening.

20:51.850 --> 20:54.239
What should I be made aware of?

20:58.420 --> 21:01.014
You think Will is on your side,

21:01.060 --> 21:03.016
that he's going to vote to get
rid of Diane.

21:03.060 --> 21:05.551
But... he's playing you.

21:05.590 --> 21:08.320
He's actually
on Diane's side.

21:08.360 --> 21:09.918
I don't believe you.

21:09.960 --> 21:12.690
Then don't. I just met with them
all yesterday.

21:12.730 --> 21:15.290
Will, Diane, and...

21:15.340 --> 21:16.534
David Lee.

21:16.570 --> 21:18.834
They're going to try
to flip Fitzpatrick

21:18.870 --> 21:20.906
to vote with them.

21:20.940 --> 21:22.999
Why are you telling me this?

21:23.040 --> 21:25.008
What do you want?

21:25.050 --> 21:26.472
I'll vote with you.

21:26.510 --> 21:28.375
But I want two things.

21:28.420 --> 21:30.888
David Lee-- out.

21:30.920 --> 21:32.945
And head of litigation.

21:32.990 --> 21:37.051
Moss is doing a superior job.

21:37.090 --> 21:39.388
I'll do a better one.

21:43.400 --> 21:44.526
SHEN YUAN:
She left me

21:44.570 --> 21:46.925
after I was out of prison.

21:46.970 --> 21:50.406
It happens to some people after
things like this.

21:50.440 --> 21:53.432
We came to America a year ago,

21:53.480 --> 21:55.869
and my wife left me.

21:57.080 --> 22:00.345
That's why she's...
testifying against you,

22:00.380 --> 22:02.746
saying you weren't tortured,
because...?

22:02.780 --> 22:04.816
She wants to hurt me.
WILL:
Okay, thanks.

22:04.850 --> 22:06.317
Can you give us
a minute?

22:07.760 --> 22:10.115
I'm-I'm sorry.

22:10.160 --> 22:12.583
It's okay.

22:15.130 --> 22:17.519
WILL:
Kalinda, get everything
you can on the wife.

22:17.570 --> 22:20.562
We need to show _
her testimony was a lie.

22:20.600 --> 22:22.761
(school bell ringing)
Are you going home?

22:25.510 --> 22:27.478
What?

22:27.510 --> 22:30.843
Becca, how far do you
think I trust you?

22:30.880 --> 22:33.371
(laughs)
Not far.

22:33.420 --> 22:36.139
What do you want?

22:36.180 --> 22:39.388
You know what I want.

22:39.420 --> 22:42.082
Thought you were into
this Florrick kid.

22:42.120 --> 22:43.929
Hey, I like politician kids.

22:43.960 --> 22:45.120
What can I say?

22:45.160 --> 22:50.154
I need one more
to complete my political...

22:50.200 --> 22:51.929
education.

22:51.970 --> 22:54.165
(phone ringing)

22:54.200 --> 22:56.498
This is Glenn Childs. Speak.

22:56.540 --> 22:58.508
GLENN, JR.:
Dad, it's me.

22:58.540 --> 23:00.474
Hey.
(staffers conversing)

23:00.510 --> 23:02.398
Hey, son, what's up?

23:02.440 --> 23:03.441
Something's weird here.

23:03.480 --> 23:04.902
This girl I know from school--

23:04.950 --> 23:06.144
the one
with Peter Florrick's kid?

23:06.180 --> 23:08.717
(snaps fingers)
Yeah?

23:08.750 --> 23:10.513
She was asking about Rita.

23:10.550 --> 23:12.541
From a few years ago.

23:12.590 --> 23:15.457
Remember? Rita from that summer.

23:15.490 --> 23:17.720
Yeah, I-I remember. Rita.

23:17.760 --> 23:19.182
She wanted to know her name.

23:19.230 --> 23:22.028
She said her parents wanted
to hire her.

23:22.060 --> 23:24.494
Did you give it to her?

23:24.530 --> 23:26.919
No. Never.

23:26.970 --> 23:29.438
Good. Thanks.

23:29.470 --> 23:31.404
Let me call someone.
I'll talk to you later.

23:32.210 --> 23:33.234
We're negotiating.

23:33.270 --> 23:35.170
They're offering too little,
and we're asking...

23:35.210 --> 23:37.098
Uh,uh".

23:37.140 --> 23:38.505
Hold on. (sighs)

23:38.550 --> 23:40.677
Mr. Lyman?

23:40.720 --> 23:42.142
I understand. Mr...

23:42.180 --> 23:45.445
Can I call you back?

23:45.490 --> 23:47.617
Mr. Lyman.
Ah.

23:47.660 --> 23:49.082
DIANE:
Good to see you.

23:50.630 --> 23:51.756
LYMAN:
We need to talk.

23:51.790 --> 23:53.621
Of course, we do.
Let's go.
Yeah...

23:53.660 --> 23:55.753
Where are we going?
Over here...

23:55.800 --> 23:57.597
(conversing
indistinctly)

23:57.630 --> 23:59.598
JuHus?

23:59.630 --> 24:02.667
What?

24:02.700 --> 24:05.168
DERRICK:
What is that about?

24:05.210 --> 24:07.166
I don't know.

24:07.210 --> 24:09.201
I'll find out.

24:11.110 --> 24:12.668
LYMAN:
It's freezing here.

24:12.710 --> 24:15.611
Mr. Lyman, I thought I said
we would talk on the phone.

24:15.650 --> 24:17.618
You've got a problem.
It's Merrick.

24:17.650 --> 24:19.743
I can't give any more.
We made a deal.

24:19.790 --> 24:21.087
You both agreed.

24:21.120 --> 24:22.656
It's not me. It's Merrick.

24:22.690 --> 24:23.952
He's dead.

24:23.990 --> 24:25.252
He was very
nervous.

24:25.290 --> 24:27.019
He was going
through his rolodex.

24:27.060 --> 24:29.221
The whole thing was
too much for him.

24:29.260 --> 24:30.659
So here's the thing.

24:30.700 --> 24:32.588
I'm still on board,
but I want everything

24:32.630 --> 24:33.767
that you promised him.

24:33.800 --> 24:35.233
Quite the humanitarian.

24:35.270 --> 24:37.568
Hey, I didn't kill him.

24:37.610 --> 24:38.702
So we're still down on votes?

24:38.740 --> 24:40.503
No, we're tied.

24:40.540 --> 24:42.906
With this, Bond has exactly
22 equity partners.

24:42.940 --> 24:44.271
We have exactly 22.

24:44.310 --> 24:46.608
Either way, I still get
my corner office, right?

24:46.650 --> 24:47.639
(phone '
rin
Oh! 95)

24:47.680 --> 24:49.568
Yeah? Kalinda, yeah.
What's going on?

24:49.620 --> 24:50.917
What?

24:50.950 --> 24:53.783
We found out why Shen Yuan's
wife walked out on him.

24:53.820 --> 24:55.253
He was cheating.

24:55.290 --> 24:58.782
ALICIA:
He joined a Free Tibet
movement when he moved

24:58.830 --> 25:01.151
to the States,
and he met a young activist

25:01.200 --> 25:03.691
a few months ago.
Oh, dear God.

25:03.730 --> 25:05.869
His wife found out about it,
and she walked out on him.

25:05.900 --> 25:07.697
No matter where you go,
you run into it.

25:07.740 --> 25:10.231
KALINDA:
We still think
you can use it

25:10.270 --> 25:11.703
to undercut
the wife's testimony.

25:11.740 --> 25:13.674
It_'s irrelevant _
to pain and suffering.

25:13.710 --> 25:15.177
Yeah, but we don't have
Nelson Mandela anymore.

25:15.210 --> 25:16.677
After years
of imprisonment and torture,

25:16.710 --> 25:18.007
he hops
into the first young bed?

25:18.050 --> 25:19.677
DIANE:
Maybe we can settle for cash.

25:19.710 --> 25:20.938
A few million?

25:20.980 --> 25:24.689
No. We need to get Chumhum to
stop these practices in China.

25:27.120 --> 25:28.815
That was the original goal
of the suit.

25:28.860 --> 25:30.725
Let me talk to him.

25:30.760 --> 25:33.058
He could... speak to his wife?

25:33.090 --> 25:35.058
Reunite with her?

25:35.100 --> 25:36.727
I don't know. Maybe.

25:36.760 --> 25:38.921
She's lying about
him being tortured.

25:38.970 --> 25:41.962
Maybe he can convince
her to recant.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.036
Okay. Good.
Mm.

25:44.070 --> 25:47.301
It's-It's nothing
to do with this.

25:47.340 --> 25:52.346
You want Chumhum to stop handing
over dissident names to China?

25:52.380 --> 25:55.975
Your wife-- you have to get
her to recant her testimony.

25:56.020 --> 25:58.841
She's... angry.

25:58.890 --> 26:00.755
She's been hurt.

26:04.830 --> 26:06.821
I... I'll talk to her.

26:30.050 --> 26:32.018
*

26:36.060 --> 26:38.358
ZACH:
You represented him, right?

26:38.390 --> 26:39.823
Patric Edelstein?

26:39.860 --> 26:40.827
ALICIA:
Yeah.

26:40.860 --> 26:42.896
He was suing that movie.

26:42.930 --> 26:45.694
I think I saw him
today at work.

26:45.730 --> 26:47.698
No, he's in Burlingame.

26:47.740 --> 26:50.300
See? Oh, no,
you're right,

26:50.340 --> 26:52.706
actually. This is his log
of public Tweets.

26:52.740 --> 26:54.401
It says he's in
Chicago till Monday.

26:54.440 --> 26:56.670
He's cool.

26:56.710 --> 26:59.372
He's, like, the fifth
richest guy in the world.

26:59.410 --> 27:01.412
Does he have any
business in China?

27:01.450 --> 27:03.111
His search engine?

27:03.150 --> 27:05.186
No, I don't think so.

27:05.220 --> 27:07.017
He's trying, though. See?

27:07.050 --> 27:09.154
He just met with the
head of Hongzheren.

27:12.160 --> 27:14.151
What's wrong?

27:15.160 --> 27:17.128
Thank you.

27:17.160 --> 27:18.923
This is about
Patric Edelstein.

27:18.970 --> 27:21.188
Patric Edelstein,
the billionaire?

27:21.240 --> 27:22.992
The one we represented

27:23.040 --> 27:25.929
in his case against the
movie about his life?

27:25.970 --> 27:26.629
We're still _
representing him?

27:26.670 --> 27:29.878
His Midwestern concerns, yes.

27:29.910 --> 27:32.105
But this China
suit-- we're doing it

27:32.150 --> 27:33.344
for Edelstein?

27:33.380 --> 27:34.972
He wants Chumhum
out of China

27:35.020 --> 27:37.079
so he can move in
and monopolize it.

27:37.120 --> 27:39.782
I don't know.

27:39.820 --> 27:42.311
But you do.

27:42.360 --> 27:45.818
It's a good case,
no matter what.

27:45.860 --> 27:48.192
Shen Yuan was tortured,
imprisoned.

27:48.230 --> 27:50.790
Yes, but that's not
why we're pursuing it.

27:50.830 --> 27:51.990
Alicia...

27:52.030 --> 27:53.167
Ijust

27:53.200 --> 27:54.929
for one minute
wanted to think

27:54.970 --> 27:56.790
that we were doing
the right thing.

27:56.840 --> 27:58.307
But we are doing
the right thing.

27:58.340 --> 27:59.898
But for the
wrong reason.
Who do you know

27:59.940 --> 28:01.737
is doing something
for the right reason?

28:01.780 --> 28:03.941
I would love to meet them,
because my guess is,

28:03.980 --> 28:05.777
after five minutes
of questioning,

28:05.810 --> 28:07.812
we'll find the wrong reason.

28:08.850 --> 28:11.045
You believe that?

28:12.950 --> 28:14.952
I do believe that.

28:14.990 --> 28:18.949
And if you thought about all
you've learned this last year,

28:18.990 --> 28:20.958
you'd believe it, too.

28:29.100 --> 28:32.001
Edelstein moves into China,
what does he do?

28:33.780 --> 28:35.771
What do you mean?

28:35.810 --> 28:39.200
Does he turn over the names
of more diSSidents?

28:42.250 --> 28:44.241
It's the law.

29:01.070 --> 29:04.062
What fresh
hell today?

29:04.110 --> 29:06.908
We thought having two more votes
would get us over the top,

29:06.940 --> 29:08.976
so we approached two
of the senior citizens

29:09.010 --> 29:10.534
who were still
on the logs

29:10.580 --> 29:12.502
as equity partners.

29:12.550 --> 29:15.417
(cackling)

29:15.450 --> 29:18.044
WILL:
Okay, David.
We get it.

29:18.090 --> 29:20.046
We get it.
No, I don't
think you do.

29:20.090 --> 29:22.058
You couldn't have
scripted it better.

29:22.090 --> 29:25.025
So what happened?
Did one of them die?

29:26.990 --> 29:32.166
(cackling)

29:32.200 --> 29:35.089
Yesterday.

29:35.140 --> 29:38.064
All you need are jugglers,
and we'll have a Roman farce.

29:38.110 --> 29:41.102
No smoking!
Go away!

29:41.140 --> 29:44.007
Anyway, I'm glad Mr. Lee
finds this so entertaining.

29:44.050 --> 29:46.177
That just puts more pressure
on you, Julius,

29:46.210 --> 29:48.075
to turn Fitzpatrick.

29:48.120 --> 29:49.178
Can you do it?

29:49.220 --> 29:50.983
All I can do is try.

29:51.020 --> 29:53.511
Oh, yes,
please, do try.

29:53.550 --> 29:55.086
So they think they're tied?

29:55.120 --> 29:58.521
Yes. With one
of Stern's gang of three.

29:58.560 --> 30:01.097
The other two died.

30:01.130 --> 30:03.496
But your vote puts
me over the top?

30:03.530 --> 30:06.067
Yes. If...

30:06.100 --> 30:08.068
I know.

30:08.100 --> 30:10.068
Head of litigation.

30:13.040 --> 30:15.008
Congratulations.

30:15.040 --> 30:17.577
You're our new
head of litigation.

30:17.610 --> 30:19.999
Okay. Thank you, ma'am.

30:20.050 --> 30:22.143
Ooh, that sounded good.

30:22.180 --> 30:24.011
Childs had another nanny.

30:24.050 --> 30:25.881
For his grown kids.

30:25.920 --> 30:27.114
A Jamaican nanny.

30:27.150 --> 30:29.152
A... I thought you
said she was Swedish.

30:29.190 --> 30:31.556
She was, but she had
to go back to Sweden to--

30:31.590 --> 30:33.899
I don't know--
swim in a fjord or something.

30:33.930 --> 30:35.124
That's Norway.
Thank you.

30:35.160 --> 30:36.195
So Childs needed
another nanny

30:36.230 --> 30:37.891
for three months
over the summer,

30:37.930 --> 30:39.898
and he hired
a Jamaican nanny illegally.

30:39.930 --> 30:41.636
I'll have to
do polling.
Wait. There's more.

30:41.670 --> 30:43.535
I wanted to seal
the deal this time.

30:43.570 --> 30:45.265
So I had someone hint to Childs

30:45.310 --> 30:47.198
that we were pursuing the
illegal nanny's identity,

30:47.240 --> 30:50.038
and he took the bait,
and led us right to her.

30:50.080 --> 30:51.900
Childs tried to
cover it up.
You're kidding?

30:51.950 --> 30:52.905
No. He tried to pay

30:52.950 --> 30:55.077
for the Jamaican nanny
to leave the country.

30:55.120 --> 30:57.042
You have it all?
Documented
and certified.

30:57.080 --> 30:59.514
Do the polling.
I'll do
the polling.

30:59.550 --> 31:02.417
VIOLA:
Oh, well, this is turning
into tit for tat, isn't it?

31:02.460 --> 31:04.257
DIANE:
Yup, and tat's up by one.

31:04.290 --> 31:06.520
Ah, it was sweet
of Shen Yuan and his wife

31:06.560 --> 31:08.391
to reunite.
WILL:
Yes, isn't it?

31:08.430 --> 31:10.398
Maybe we should go
into couples therapy.

31:10.430 --> 31:13.524
Well, I have one more name

31:13.570 --> 31:16.539
that I'd like to add
to our witness list.

31:23.340 --> 31:25.308
Paul Houghton?

31:25.350 --> 31:27.238
Of the Bush
administration?

31:27.280 --> 31:29.043
HOUGHTON:
Yes.

31:29.080 --> 31:31.685
I wrote the memo
to President George W. Bush,

31:31.720 --> 31:34.109
since referred to
as the Houghton Working Memo.

31:34.160 --> 31:37.550
It expressed the legal
position that certain

31:37.590 --> 31:40.286
aggressive interrogation
techniques were not torture.

31:40.330 --> 31:43.299
WILL: _
So what are you saying--
Shen Yuan was not tortured?

31:43.330 --> 31:45.218
Well, I have no
opinion on that.

31:45.270 --> 31:46.362
I can tell you

31:46.400 --> 31:48.493
the opinion of the Bush
administration at the time.

31:48.540 --> 31:50.167
VIOLA: Oh, well,
let's hear about that.

31:50.200 --> 31:51.565
Shen Yuan was forced to stand

31:51.610 --> 31:53.202
in the stress position
during his captivity.

31:53.240 --> 31:54.207
Is this torture?

31:54.240 --> 31:56.606
Well, as long
as there was no organ failure

31:56.640 --> 31:58.346
or serious impairment
of body functions, then,

31:58.380 --> 32:00.075
in the opinion
of the United States

32:00.110 --> 32:01.646
at the time, it was not.

32:01.680 --> 32:04.240
VIOLA:
Well, Shen Yuan claims
he was beaten and slapped.

32:04.290 --> 32:05.348
Is that torture?

32:05.390 --> 32:07.085
HOUGHTON:
Again, if there was no

32:07.120 --> 32:08.712
organ failure or impairment
of body function,

32:08.760 --> 32:11.558
then, in the opinion of the
United States, it was not.

32:11.590 --> 32:13.148
The United States has since

32:13.190 --> 32:15.499
revoked your legal opinions,
Mr. Houghton.

32:15.530 --> 32:18.294
Yes. January 2009.

32:18.330 --> 32:20.264
Oh, wow.
That's too bad.

32:20.300 --> 32:21.699
Because Shen Yuan claims

32:21.740 --> 32:23.696
that there was no such
aggresswe questioning

32:23.740 --> 32:25.162
after 2008.

32:25.210 --> 32:27.166
So, it was the opinion
of the United States

32:27.210 --> 32:28.973
that there was no torture

32:29.010 --> 32:31.649
_at the time
in question.

32:31.680 --> 32:34.342
So, are you
up for it?

32:34.380 --> 32:36.439
Convincing him
to lie?

32:36.480 --> 32:38.141
There just needs to
be the possibility

32:38.190 --> 32:40.146
of torture after
January 2009.

32:40.190 --> 32:41.350
That's all.
This is so bizarre.

32:41.390 --> 32:44.484
We need him to be tortured
during the Obama administration,

32:44.530 --> 32:47.055
or we hobble
our case?
And Edelstein's.

32:53.370 --> 32:56.066
Do you want us
to put somebody else on it?

33:00.240 --> 33:02.299
No.

33:07.250 --> 33:10.378
(conversing indistinctly)

33:10.420 --> 33:12.183
What do you think?

33:12.220 --> 33:14.211
I think we're fine.

33:16.190 --> 33:18.522
I always liked this office.

33:21.800 --> 33:25.395
Oh, you know, I used to have
a dartboard over there.

33:25.430 --> 33:28.137
Could hit the bull's-eye
from my chair.

33:28.170 --> 33:30.536
I remember that.

33:30.570 --> 33:32.504
In fact...

33:33.610 --> 33:36.033
...I kept a remnant of you.

33:36.080 --> 33:37.274
(chuckles)

33:37.310 --> 33:39.574
What's the game here, Peter?

33:43.720 --> 33:45.187
It's over.

33:45.220 --> 33:47.211
You're out of the race.

33:48.260 --> 33:49.557
Really? You have a gun?

33:49.590 --> 33:51.148
Almost as good.

33:51.190 --> 33:54.159
See, Wendy could survive
a nanny problem.

33:54.200 --> 33:55.792
She's likeable
and she's a mother,

33:55.830 --> 33:58.367
and she didn't
try to cover it up.

33:58.400 --> 33:59.628
You did.

33:59.670 --> 34:02.230
People can forgive a lot,
but they can't forgive

34:02.270 --> 34:04.465
a cover-up.
What are you

34:04.510 --> 34:05.659
talking about?

34:05.710 --> 34:07.200
You hired a nanny for a summer,

34:07.240 --> 34:08.502
you paid her under the table,

34:08.540 --> 34:10.735
and then when you heard
that we were on her trail,

34:10.780 --> 34:12.543
you tried to pay her
to leave the country.

34:12.580 --> 34:13.774
So, what, are you
recording this?

34:13.810 --> 34:17.211
I don't have to record it.

34:17.250 --> 34:19.548
We recorded the payoff.

34:20.650 --> 34:22.584
Then you know
it was three months.

34:22.620 --> 34:25.350
Three months of a nanny
taking care of my kids,

34:25.390 --> 34:26.618
not Wendy's five years.

34:26.660 --> 34:29.754
Yes, but I also seem to recall
a candidate at the last debate

34:29.800 --> 34:32.496
who said, "You can't just say,
'Oops, my bad.'"

34:32.530 --> 34:36.330
How do you think that
sound bite's gonna play?

34:36.370 --> 34:38.429
You're a son of a bitch.

34:40.340 --> 34:41.329
Yeah.

34:41.380 --> 34:43.177
Not just that. You...

34:43.210 --> 34:46.202
you belong in the trophy
case of sons of bitches.

34:46.250 --> 34:49.413
You think I'm in this job
just to beat you, Peter?

34:49.450 --> 34:51.315
Just to exercise power?

34:51.350 --> 34:54.285
I'm in this job to do good.

34:54.320 --> 34:58.256
What do you think,
you're the only person
who wants to do good?

34:58.290 --> 35:00.656
Get out of here.
Get out of my office.

35:08.900 --> 35:10.265
Good afternoon.

35:10.300 --> 35:12.461
As you can imagine,
the demands of this job

35:12.510 --> 35:14.330
are all-encompassing,

35:14.380 --> 35:17.338
and I've always said to myself,
"Family first, job second,

35:17.380 --> 35:19.268
campaign third."

35:19.310 --> 35:21.449
And for that reason...

35:21.480 --> 35:24.210
I am withdrawing
my candidacy for this race.

35:24.250 --> 35:25.888
(cheering, whooping)

35:31.890 --> 35:34.552
Are you gonna tell him
who discovered the nanny?
No.

35:34.600 --> 35:36.227
I don't know._
I promised AllCla

35:36.260 --> 35:38.160
not to bring the kids
into the race.

35:38.200 --> 35:39.724
You didn't;
theyjumped in.

35:39.770 --> 35:41.362
He's on. He's on.

35:41.400 --> 35:42.833
Sir?

35:42.870 --> 35:44.531
It's a two-way race.

35:44.570 --> 35:46.162
I am leaving this race purely

35:46.210 --> 35:47.563
because of _
the pressures on my family.

35:47.610 --> 35:49.874
YesI
(laughing)

35:49.910 --> 35:52.743
Oh, my gosh!

35:56.580 --> 35:58.616
JACKIE:
You kids want

35:58.650 --> 35:59.582
some corn bread?

35:59.620 --> 36:00.712
BECCA:
Oh, not now,
Jackie.

36:00.750 --> 36:02.650
We're okay.

36:07.690 --> 36:10.921
So..._he recovered
his memory

36:10.960 --> 36:14.361
about being waterboarded
in February of 2009.

36:14.400 --> 36:15.662
WILL:
Yes,

36:15.700 --> 36:17.565
all the pain and suffering

36:17.600 --> 36:20.262
kept him from memorizing
fully, until now.

36:20.310 --> 36:21.470
Well, I guess

36:21.510 --> 36:24.274
our friend, Shen Yuan, caught on
to America pretty quickly.

36:24.310 --> 36:26.505
DIANE: You're
a good teacher.

36:26.550 --> 36:29.417
$30 million,
and you stop handing over

36:29.450 --> 36:31.384
dissident names.

36:31.420 --> 36:33.240
(sighs)

36:34.290 --> 36:35.917
(sighs)
I hate Chicago.

36:35.960 --> 36:38.827
It's a mean place.

36:38.860 --> 36:40.327
WILL:
Unlike Silicon Valley?

36:40.360 --> 36:41.520
Mm, all this...

36:41.560 --> 36:43.926
architecture.

36:43.960 --> 36:46.360
We know the future, at least.

36:46.400 --> 36:48.595
We know boundaries
are disappearing.

36:48.640 --> 36:51.859
China, North Korea,
they're all just concepts.

36:51.910 --> 36:53.969
Concepts holding us back.

36:54.010 --> 36:55.329
From what?

36:55.380 --> 36:56.404
From a free flow

36:56.440 --> 36:58.442
of power and information.

36:58.480 --> 36:59.640
That is the future.

36:59.680 --> 37:03.776
See, you guys, you're all
just fighting over things.

37:03.820 --> 37:05.515
You've got a bag of pennies

37:05.550 --> 37:07.415
when everyone else
is using credit cards.

37:07.450 --> 37:09.008
Things are dead.

37:09.060 --> 37:12.552
Things are...

37:12.590 --> 37:14.296
uncooL

37:17.800 --> 37:19.461
No money...

37:19.500 --> 37:22.298
and we'll agree to stop
handing names to China.

37:24.310 --> 37:25.459
Really?

37:25.510 --> 37:26.909
What happened?

37:26.940 --> 37:29.306
Oh, you showed us
the error of our ways.

37:30.740 --> 37:32.401
You're getting out of China?

37:32.450 --> 37:34.714
We're considering it.

37:34.750 --> 37:36.877
It's too much
of a hassle,

37:36.920 --> 37:38.581
too protectionist.

37:38.620 --> 37:40.884
So, are we agreed?

37:44.760 --> 37:46.728
(sighs)
Good. Then we...

37:46.760 --> 37:49.490
are out of here.

37:56.040 --> 37:58.031
(quietly):
Here we go.

38:01.070 --> 38:02.606
In ten minutes,

38:02.640 --> 38:05.609
either Bond will run
this firm, or we will.

38:11.590 --> 38:12.989
Good job.

38:27.670 --> 38:30.559
(conversing indistinctly)

38:37.510 --> 38:39.307
VIOLA:
Alicia.

38:40.410 --> 38:42.640
You don't belong here.

38:42.680 --> 38:44.739
What do you mean?

38:44.790 --> 38:46.587
I think we should talk.

38:46.620 --> 38:48.656
They're undervaluing you.

38:48.690 --> 38:50.817
I won't.

38:50.860 --> 38:52.828
I'm not interested.

38:56.630 --> 38:58.621
I'm persistent.

39:05.540 --> 39:07.861
Thank you, everyone.

39:07.910 --> 39:10.606
Well, here we are again.

39:10.640 --> 39:12.801
On behalf of the name partners,

39:12.850 --> 39:15.876
I would like to thank everybody
for making the time,

39:15.920 --> 39:18.684
and I would like
to introduce a new face,

39:18.720 --> 39:20.540
Mr. Howard Lyman.

39:20.590 --> 39:22.751
Here.
One of the first partners

39:22.790 --> 39:24.985
in this business,
he thought he would return

39:25.030 --> 39:27.385
to the fold,
and we welcome you

39:27.430 --> 39:29.591
with open arms.

39:29.630 --> 39:30.426
(clapping)

39:30.460 --> 39:32.519
Now, at this point,
I must express

39:32.570 --> 39:35.892
some bafflement
at the cause for this meeting.

39:35.940 --> 39:39.569
I think you had
some business, Derrick.

39:39.610 --> 39:41.168
Yes. Thank you.

39:41.210 --> 39:42.939
(clears throat)

39:42.980 --> 39:46.108
Now, we've had
some troubling reports of you...

39:46.150 --> 39:47.572
trying to steal

39:47.610 --> 39:49.168
clients and
partners, Diane,

39:49.220 --> 39:51.609
and start your own firm.
Now, the thing
(murmuring)

39:51.650 --> 39:53.481
we need to value
more than anything

39:53.520 --> 39:55.886
at this firm is cohesion,
and that is the only reason...

39:55.920 --> 39:58.627
What crap!
Just vote.

39:58.660 --> 40:00.423
(chuckling)
DERRICK:
Thank you, David.

40:00.460 --> 40:02.599
I'd like to call a vote
of all the equ partners

40:02.630 --> 40:06.066
to censure and dismiss Diane
Lockhart as an equ partner.

40:06.100 --> 40:07.658
(murmuring)

40:07.700 --> 40:09.759
Would you like me to hand over
the gavel for this vote?

40:09.800 --> 40:11.939
No. Keep it.

40:11.970 --> 40:13.961
Do we have a second?

40:14.010 --> 40:15.671
Second.
Second.
Any debate?

40:15.710 --> 40:17.439
Just call the question.
Come on.

40:17.480 --> 40:19.607
By a show of hands,

40:19.650 --> 40:22.118
who agrees to censure
and dismiss me?

40:36.760 --> 40:38.193
DIANE:
19, 20...

40:38.230 --> 40:39.959
The motion falls short.

40:40.000 --> 40:43.492
You had me fire my head of
litigation and put you in.

40:43.540 --> 40:45.132
Yeah.

40:45.170 --> 40:46.068
Why?

40:46.110 --> 40:48.066
I don't like you.

40:48.110 --> 40:52.171
DIANE:
Are there any other motions?

40:53.610 --> 40:55.612
I move that we get rid of Bond

40:55.650 --> 40:58.915
and I get his office
for my second secretary.

40:58.950 --> 41:00.679
DIANE:
Are there any seconds?

41:00.720 --> 41:01.709
Second it.

41:01.760 --> 41:02.988
DIANE:
By a show of hands,

41:03.020 --> 41:04.954
all those in favor?

41:04.990 --> 41:06.685
This when I vote?

41:14.570 --> 41:16.629
DERRICK (quietly):
You stupid son of a bitch.

41:16.670 --> 41:17.739
Yep.

41:17.770 --> 41:21.706
DIANE:
21, 22, 23-- the motion passes.

41:21.740 --> 41:25.506
Derrick Bond has been removed
as name partner.

41:25.550 --> 41:26.869
And I get his office.

41:26.910 --> 41:29.572
(murmuring)

41:55.710 --> 41:57.132
Good plan.

41:57.180 --> 41:59.842
Nice execution.

42:13.960 --> 42:15.996
We're the perfect couple.

42:16.030 --> 42:18.726
(chuckles) Yeah.

42:18.770 --> 42:20.726
Everything but the sex.

42:20.770 --> 42:22.829
(both laughing)

42:24.370 --> 42:26.338
CHILDS (on video):
As you can imagine,

42:26.370 --> 42:28.338
the demands of this job are
all-encompassing.

42:28.370 --> 42:32.340
But I've always said to myself
family first, job second...

42:32.380 --> 42:34.871
(CthsconﬁnuesspeaHng)
Zach.

42:34.920 --> 42:36.911
Hey, Dad.

42:38.050 --> 42:40.041
Come here.

42:41.290 --> 42:43.258
Something wrong?
No.

42:43.290 --> 42:44.826
Come here.

42:47.830 --> 42:49.127
Thank you.

42:51.930 --> 42:53.921
You did it.

42:55.240 --> 42:58.937
CHILDS: ...gossip is inevitable,
but I want my supporters to know

42:58.970 --> 43:01.006
that I am leaving this race

43:01.040 --> 43:04.908
purely because of the pressures
on my family. Thank you.

43:04.950 --> 43:08.374

Mr. Childs, do you blame
Peter Florrick for this?
