If we launch a stealth assault there

overwhelm them in one sweep.

If Chau were to get wind of the attack,

as long as she remains Baron.

or we send Chau your head.

you'll bleed to death.

17:45.880 --> 17:47.712
Understand?

17:47.800 --> 17:50.633
The Widow and Gaius,
are they still alive?

17:52.120 --> 17:53.679
Where are they being kept?

17:55.320 --> 17:57.709

18:18.080 --> 18:20.879
MOON: A truckload of turncoats
wiped out a check point.

18:20.960 --> 18:23.349
I'm assuming the Sanctuary
has already fallen.

18:25.280 --> 18:27.317
Didn't know
who else to turn to.

18:28.400 --> 18:31.279
-You sure The Widow's still alive?
-There's only one way to find out.

Round up what's left of your fighters.

18:33.400 --> 18:35.994
If we combine forces
we can take the Sanctuary back.

18:36.080 --> 18:37.593
You don't even know
what's going on inside.

18:37.680 --> 18:39.557

19:25.920 --> 19:28.116
No one ever gets
that close to him in battle,

19:28.200 --> 19:30.271

when The Widow returned him.

19:31.160 --> 19:33.197
What are you asking, dear one?

19:35.080 --> 19:36.798
How did Castor die?

19:36.880 --> 19:38.951
He was sick

19:39.040 --> 19:41.793
and he passed peacefully in my arms.

19:41.880 --> 19:43.757
Peace doesn't leave marks.

19:53.080 --> 19:55.435
Disquiet is the pestilence

19:58.960 --> 20:02.112

21:05.440 --> 21:08.000
Are you here to kill me?

21:08.120 --> 21:11.351
The River King sent me. I'm here to talk.

21:13.480 --> 21:15.278
Suit yourself.

21:21.040 --> 21:23.031
More for me, then.

21:23.120 --> 21:26.511
The River King says you were
the only survivor of a massacre.

21:26.600 --> 21:30.434
Well, there goes my buzz.

21:40.120 --> 21:42.475
You were the boy.

21:42.560 --> 21:44.471
You were the one they were after.

21:46.400 --> 21:49.472
-Who?
-Beats the hell out of me.

21:51.120 --> 21:55.398
But... they wore red and black armor.

21:58.640 --> 22:02.031
And they left a souvenir in my head.

22:08.560 --> 22:12.599
We were out at sea, a day, two maybe,

22:12.680 --> 22:15.832
when a boat came up on us
in the dead of night.

22:16.480 --> 22:19.154
It was so quiet.

22:21.480 --> 22:26.156
Then they boarded us and moved in
as silent as death itself,

22:26.280 --> 22:30.877
and attacked with a ferocity
I'd never seen before or since.

22:30.960 --> 22:33.190
But the girl, your sister,

22:33.280 --> 22:35.635
she put up a hell of a fight.

22:35.720 --> 22:38.712
My sister? What was her name?

22:38.800 --> 22:41.155
Didn't ask, she didn't offer.

22:42.320 --> 22:46.075
But that night,
she was your guardian angel.

22:46.160 --> 22:48.720
-What happened to her?
-Damned if I know.

22:48.800 --> 22:52.031

23:01.800 --> 23:04.360

-Uh, she's a Viceroy.

24:13.680 --> 24:15.398
I've overheard the arguments

24:15.480 --> 24:18.472
She isn't happy with the way
the war's been going.

24:18.600 --> 24:20.796
Won't hurt to hear
what she has to offer first.

24:20.880 --> 24:24.430
Ah, this war's destroyed
far too many lives.

24:24.520 --> 24:27.080
But Chau will never believe in
the authenticity of any document

or without me.

24:30.480 --> 24:32.551
You? Oh, how convenient.

24:32.640 --> 24:35.758
Chau and her people know that
I've pledged my loyalty to The Widow.

24:35.840 --> 24:39.151

this armistice is if I deliver it myself.
