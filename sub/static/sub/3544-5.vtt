00:02.160 --> 00:03.570
Previously on The Vampire Diaries:

00:03.760 --> 00:05.200
- I'm Elena.
- I'm Stefan.

00:05.240 --> 00:08.562
<i>Love brought me to Mystic Falls.
Love drove me away.</i>

00:08.760 --> 00:10.330
I love you, Damon.

00:11.560 --> 00:13.562
- Silas.
- Hello, my shadow self.

00:15.400 --> 00:18.051
- Even though we've lost so much...
- Bonnie's dead, Elena.

00:18.280 --> 00:20.760
I can't believe she's gone.

00:21.240 --> 00:23.481
- Aah!
- What are you doing to my brother?

00:23.680 --> 00:26.570
- Stefan.
- I have no idea who you people are.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.720
<i>...Our enemies still line up against us.</i>

00:28.880 --> 00:31.042
- Which one of you is Katherine Pierce?
- She is.

00:31.240 --> 00:32.287
I need her alive.

00:32.479 --> 00:36.246
- What do you want with me, Silas?
- Your blood is the cure, Katherine.

00:36.440 --> 00:37.487
I'm Dr. Maxfield.

00:37.720 --> 00:41.725
Good news about having vampire blood is
that's step one to creating a new vampire.

00:42.400 --> 00:44.721
- This is step two.
- Unh!

01:09.440 --> 01:11.090
Dr. Maxfield, please.

01:11.880 --> 01:14.201
Why are you doing this?

01:14.640 --> 01:17.007
My insides, they're burning up.

01:18.560 --> 01:19.641
I'm hungry-

01:19.840 --> 01:22.002
Subject 62547.

01:22.200 --> 01:26.489
After his initial transition, 62547 has
undergone three days without feeding.

01:27.520 --> 01:30.683
Subject is weak but lucid.

01:32.200 --> 01:37.525
Upper left and right cuspid normal
after blood stimulus is removed.

01:38.880 --> 01:40.689
What are you doing to me?

01:41.520 --> 01:44.524
Pupils are at full dilation.
Sensitivity to light...

01:45.760 --> 01:48.730
Sensitivity to light, an obvious 11
on a scale from one to 10.

01:50.920 --> 01:53.651
What the hell's happening to me?
Why am I so hungry?

01:56.040 --> 01:57.280
What are you doing to me?

01:57.480 --> 02:00.484
Subject is confused yet self-aware.

02:00.720 --> 02:02.324
Personality seems intact.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.968
Hunger remains primary focus.

02:05.160 --> 02:09.085
All-in-all,
appears to be a perfect candidate.

02:15.040 --> 02:16.610
Dear diary...

02:17.040 --> 02:19.008
<i>do you ever get sick of me
writing about death?</i>

02:21.240 --> 02:23.288
<i>It's been four days
since Bonnie died...</i>

02:23.480 --> 02:26.529
<i>or four days
since I found out Bonnie died.</i>

02:26.720 --> 02:29.849
<i>She wanted me to go back to school,
so here I am.</i>

02:30.080 --> 02:33.641
<i>Back at school. Studying.
Going to class.</i>

02:33.880 --> 02:35.928
<i>Trying to move on
like everyone else.</i>

02:37.680 --> 02:39.569
<i>Stefan has it easiest.</i>

02:39.800 --> 02:41.882
<i>He doesn't even remember Bonnie.</i>

02:42.080 --> 02:45.163
<i>Not that anybody's seen him
except for Caroline...</i>

02:45.360 --> 02:46.691
<i>who's back with Tyler.</i>

02:48.800 --> 02:51.326
<i>He's been a healthy distraction for her.</i>

02:51.880 --> 02:53.325
<i>To say the least.</i>

02:54.760 --> 02:57.604
<i>And I have adopted
my own distraction.</i>

02:58.080 --> 03:00.321
<i>Dr. Wes Maxfield.</i>

03:00.840 --> 03:04.447
<i>My roommate was killed by a vampire,
and Dr. Maxfield covered it up.</i>

03:04.800 --> 03:05.961
<i>And I'd like to know Why.</i>

03:08.520 --> 03:09.567
Welcome back.

03:11.120 --> 03:13.964
- See you at the costume ball tonight?
- I wouldn't miss it.

03:18.800 --> 03:21.610
<i>Besides, the more I have to think about...</i>

03:22.680 --> 03:24.762
<i>the less time I have
to miss Bonnie.</i>

03:31.120 --> 03:33.009
I'm right here, Elena.

03:33.800 --> 03:35.643
And I miss you too.

03:35.840 --> 03:39.367
<i>But in the meantime, I choose
to believe that she's watching over me.</i>

03:39.880 --> 03:41.166
<i>Because that's who Bonnie is.</i>

03:52.960 --> 03:54.485
Busted.

03:55.720 --> 03:57.449
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:57.640 --> 04:02.282
- Miss Avoiding-Me-for-Three-Days.
- Avoiding you? We've been talking.

04:02.480 --> 04:04.767
Texting. One time.

04:04.960 --> 04:08.123
"Wanna be my plus one
at a costume ball?" Winky face.

04:08.320 --> 04:09.606
And you never replied.

04:09.800 --> 04:13.009
So I'm guessing this special
in-person visit means yes?

04:13.200 --> 04:15.806
Definitely will maybe consider
thinking about it.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.161
It's at 8:00.
Caroline got us costumes.

04:19.240 --> 04:22.164
- Where are you going?
- Class. I'm late.

04:28.720 --> 04:32.281
Oh, before I forget, I talked to
the registrar and your major is...

04:32.480 --> 04:35.051
drumroll... Sociology.

04:35.240 --> 04:37.607
How about we don't talk about
my major right now?

04:37.800 --> 04:39.484
And I compelled you a single.

04:40.400 --> 04:42.801
Definitely don't want
to talk about my dorm room.

04:43.000 --> 04:47.164
We could talk about the hybrid-sized jerk that
you've been for not calling me back. Ever.

04:47.360 --> 04:49.283
How many times
do you want me to tell you?

04:49.640 --> 04:53.008
I've been helping a werewolf pack
in the land of no cell phone reception.

04:53.360 --> 04:56.011
I've figured out a way
for you to make up for it.

04:56.200 --> 04:58.328
I thought I did make up for it.

04:58.560 --> 05:00.164
A couple dozen times.

05:01.880 --> 05:05.248
You are escorting me
to the Whitmore Historical Ball.

05:06.080 --> 05:07.161
The what?

05:07.360 --> 05:10.204
It's the one time a year
they put their collection on display.

05:10.400 --> 05:12.482
Everyone dresses
as famous historical figures.

05:12.880 --> 05:16.202
I got Stefan a costume.
Even he's going. Come on, Tyler.

05:16.400 --> 05:18.528
How cute will we be
as Bonnie and Clyde?

05:19.640 --> 05:20.687
Seriously?

05:21.960 --> 05:23.769
You're right. Let's not talk.

05:43.600 --> 05:44.806
<i>Hey</i>

05:47.080 --> 05:48.127
<i>Hey</i>

05:49.600 --> 05:51.045
I'm Elena.

05:51.360 --> 05:53.124
Megan used to be my roommate.

05:58.440 --> 05:59.566
Did you know her?

06:00.800 --> 06:02.882
We knew each other growing up.

06:03.080 --> 06:04.684
Oh, wow.

06:06.040 --> 06:07.087
I'm sorry.

06:10.440 --> 06:13.284
Pretty sad memorial, huh?

06:14.640 --> 06:17.962
Guess it's not exactly cool
to mourn during fall rush.

06:18.800 --> 06:20.165
Everyone mourns differently.

06:20.920 --> 06:22.206
Some do flowers.

06:22.440 --> 06:25.205
Others do what their loved ones
would have wanted.

06:26.680 --> 06:30.127
What Megan would have wanted
is to still be here. Alive.

06:30.800 --> 06:32.290
They said she committed suicide.

06:32.760 --> 06:35.809
Yeah, I know. That's what they said.

06:37.800 --> 06:40.326
So then what do you think happened?

06:44.480 --> 06:45.891
You know, if you, uh...

06:46.320 --> 06:47.890
If you care about her...

06:48.280 --> 06:51.011
get her sunflowers. She liked those.

06:52.840 --> 06:55.127
Hey. Do you have a name?

06:55.480 --> 06:57.562
Yeah. I do.

07:02.440 --> 07:05.284
Cut to the chase, Silas.
What do you want?

07:05.600 --> 07:08.285
- I want Katherine. What do you think I want?
- So do I.

07:08.480 --> 07:10.721
Which is why
I took her away from you.

07:11.200 --> 07:15.603
You can have your brown-eyed bitch
of a cure for immortality when I'm done.

07:15.800 --> 07:17.689
But you've had her all night long.

07:17.880 --> 07:20.611
- So how much longer do you need?
- Aren't you immortal?

07:20.800 --> 07:23.485
<i>- What's</i> a <i>few more</i> hours <i>to you?
- Here's the thing, Nadia.</i>

07:23.680 --> 07:26.206
I don't care about what you need.
I care about what I need.

07:26.400 --> 07:28.004
<i>I'm a little selfish like that.</i>

07:28.200 --> 07:32.205
Why don't you mind control a whole town
and find out where I'm holding her?

07:32.520 --> 07:34.522
Right. You can't.

07:35.080 --> 07:38.880
I'm very well aware of my current superpower
predicament, thank you very much.

07:39.080 --> 07:40.844
Even though my brain
is on the fritz...

07:41.040 --> 07:44.328
thanks to an ex-fiancee stalker witch
who can't seem to take a hint...

07:44.560 --> 07:46.688
<i>doesn't mean
I'm not brilliant and crafty...</i>

07:46.880 --> 07:50.885
and becoming rapidly well-versed
in the power of cell phone tracking.

07:52.920 --> 07:55.400
A little tip, woman to woman.

07:56.400 --> 07:58.687
Don't piss off the diabolical ones.

07:58.880 --> 08:02.851
And if you're gonna hold me hostage,
the least you can do is feed me properly.

08:03.080 --> 08:05.651
We'll eat lunch on the road.
Let's get out of here.

08:05.880 --> 08:08.645
Or hand me over.
Let him take his little sip of my blood...

08:08.880 --> 08:11.451
so that he can cure
himself of immortality...

08:11.640 --> 08:15.247
and we can all be on our merry way
back to finer accommodations.

08:15.720 --> 08:18.121
A little tip, woman to woman.

08:18.600 --> 08:21.888
Don't offer to hand yourself over
to the diabolical ones...

08:22.080 --> 08:26.529
- ...when you don't know the whole story.
- Indulge me. What's the whole story?

08:26.720 --> 08:30.327
Silas needs more than just a sip
to cure himself.

08:31.080 --> 08:36.610
He needs every last drop
of your blood in your body.

08:37.280 --> 08:38.804
But I'm a human now.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.570
- If he did that, then...
- You die.

08:41.760 --> 08:43.967
- Now come on. Let's go.
- Unh.

08:44.159 --> 08:45.605
So as we know...

08:45.800 --> 08:48.724
in a psychotic lapse of judgment...

08:48.960 --> 08:51.281
Bonnie brought you
back to life and died.

08:52.120 --> 08:53.246
May she rest in peace.

08:54.040 --> 08:55.769
She's actually right over there.

08:58.440 --> 09:00.090
Whatever. Look.

09:00.280 --> 09:03.090
The point is, I just happen to know
a supernatural being...

09:03.280 --> 09:04.770
who happens to wanna die.

09:04.960 --> 09:07.611
And in the spirit
of nature needing balance...

09:07.800 --> 09:10.087
and a life for a life
and all that stuff...

09:10.280 --> 09:12.521
it would be a huge waste
of a good death.

09:12.800 --> 09:14.404
What are you talking about?

09:14.600 --> 09:17.729
Something Elena
doesn't need to know about until it works.

09:17.920 --> 09:20.810
Wait. You wanna work with Silas?

09:24.800 --> 09:26.370
So...

09:26.800 --> 09:28.245
why did you call me?

09:28.640 --> 09:29.880
Same reason you answered.

09:30.600 --> 09:31.840
You need help.

09:32.520 --> 09:33.567
And I wanna help you.

09:35.160 --> 09:36.400
From the beginning...

09:36.600 --> 09:41.128
Silas' whole bad-guy plan was to kill himself,
pass on to wherever he was gonna pass on to...

09:41.320 --> 09:42.810
and reunite with Amara.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.810
I wanna use his death
to bring Bonnie back to life.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.288
- What makes you think I need help?
- For starters, you're still here.

09:49.640 --> 09:53.690
As in, why do you suck so badly
at killing yourself?

09:54.440 --> 09:56.329
To die, he has to be mortal.

09:56.520 --> 09:58.284
If he's mortal, he's a witch.

09:58.480 --> 10:01.131
If he dies as a witch,
he's stuck on the Other Side forever.

10:01.320 --> 10:04.483
He already tried to bring down the veil
to the Other Side. He failed.

10:04.680 --> 10:08.810
Maybe he has a plan B. He wants to do more
than drop the veil and let the ghosts out.

10:12.040 --> 10:13.883
She knows I can't hear her, right?

10:14.160 --> 10:17.004
She thinks Silas wants to destroy
the Other Side completely.

10:17.560 --> 10:21.042
Powerful spells are bound
by something even more powerful.

10:21.720 --> 10:25.042
The moon, a comet, a doppelganger.

10:25.240 --> 10:28.642
The Other Side was made 2000 years ago,
and it still exists.

10:28.840 --> 10:32.162
She must have bound it to something
that could exist just as long.

10:32.400 --> 10:34.482
A mystical anchor.

10:34.680 --> 10:37.001
That's what binds her spell
to the Other Side.

10:37.200 --> 10:38.884
I want to destroy it.

10:39.360 --> 10:43.524
Qetsiyah, or Tessa, or whatever the hell
she's calling herself these days...

10:43.720 --> 10:45.245
she wants to protect it.

10:45.560 --> 10:48.484
So she's the only person that knows
where the anchor is hidden.

10:48.680 --> 10:53.083
But fortunately, she will be at the
Whitmore Historical Ball this evening.

10:53.680 --> 10:55.409
- Really?
- Mm.

10:55.600 --> 10:57.807
I thought you lost all
of your psychic powers.

10:58.160 --> 11:02.006
Oh, I did. But I still have
my incredible powers of observation.

11:02.200 --> 11:05.886
And I observed her
buying a Cleopatra costume today.

11:06.080 --> 11:08.082
Back to my original question.

11:08.280 --> 11:12.046
Let's say Silas destroys the Other Side,
cures himself, becomes a witch.

11:12.240 --> 11:14.163
Is it supernaturally possible...

11:14.400 --> 11:18.041
that he can do a spell that swaps her life
for his life once he, pfft, kills himself?

11:18.280 --> 11:23.684
Supernaturally, yeah, it's possible. But this
is the same Silas who murdered my father.

11:23.880 --> 11:26.087
He's ruthless.
And whatever spell he could do...

11:26.280 --> 11:29.568
there'll be some consequences.
There always is. So, no.

11:29.760 --> 11:31.125
My answer is definitely not.

11:32.680 --> 11:33.761
What'd she say? Tell me.

11:37.520 --> 11:39.409
- She's in.
- What?

11:39.600 --> 11:43.127
- So we have a deal.
- Well, we have half a deal.

11:43.440 --> 11:47.764
I'm resurrecting some witch
with my death...

11:48.280 --> 11:50.760
but we have yet to discuss
how you're helping me.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.769
You've yet to tell me what you want.

11:52.960 --> 11:54.724
Oh, it's fairly simple, actually.

11:55.480 --> 11:56.970
I want you to kill your brother.

12:05.080 --> 12:07.481
I've been tailing you for 500 years.

12:08.280 --> 12:10.931
There are a few things
I'd like to clear up.

12:11.160 --> 12:12.761
Why would I tell you anything?

12:12.960 --> 12:15.486
You indulge me in some answers...

12:15.920 --> 12:17.046
and I will let you go.

12:17.240 --> 12:18.526
Really?

12:18.720 --> 12:21.610
My freedom
in exchange for a little Q and A?

12:23.480 --> 12:24.527
Okay.

12:27.160 --> 12:28.810
In 1864...

12:29.000 --> 12:31.651
there was a vampire roundup
in Mystic Falls.

12:31.840 --> 12:33.968
Was there? I'm bad with dates.

12:34.160 --> 12:36.361
Word on the street is that
you sold out many vampires...

12:36.400 --> 12:38.880
including your best friend Pearl
and her daughter Annabelle.

12:39.040 --> 12:40.565
I was running from Klaus.

12:40.760 --> 12:44.128
I needed to jet solo. I threw
a couple of vampire names on the hit list.

12:44.360 --> 12:45.725
Sue me.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.561
I also impersonated a teenager to get
my ex-boyfriends to make out with me...

12:49.760 --> 12:52.843
staged a fake fight
to trigger my lover's werewolf curse...

12:53.080 --> 12:56.323
ooh, and I chopped off this douchey
guy's fingers with a butcher knife once.

12:56.520 --> 12:58.204
That was cool.

12:58.400 --> 13:01.210
What about ripping a mother
away from her daughter...

13:01.680 --> 13:04.081
having her killed for your own benefit?

13:04.280 --> 13:05.520
What are you getting at?

13:05.760 --> 13:07.524
Know a little bit about me.

13:08.040 --> 13:11.726
I had myself turned into a vampire
to hunt you.

13:11.920 --> 13:13.684
To even the playing field.

13:13.880 --> 13:19.125
To track your every move for however
long it took me until I found you.

13:20.080 --> 13:21.570
And I did this...

13:22.760 --> 13:24.762
because you killed my mother.

13:28.440 --> 13:30.124
It happened in Paris.

13:30.880 --> 13:33.087
1645.

13:34.320 --> 13:35.970
I go to Paris for shoes.

13:36.160 --> 13:37.241
The shoes I remember.

13:37.440 --> 13:39.807
Everything else
requires a few more details.

13:40.440 --> 13:42.363
Her name was Lily Otoma.

13:42.560 --> 13:44.642
You were on the run from Klaus.

13:45.440 --> 13:47.727
She took you in.
But when his minions showed up...

13:47.920 --> 13:51.163
you pointed at my morn and you said,
"That is Katerina Petrova.

13:51.360 --> 13:53.010
She is the one you want."

13:53.440 --> 13:55.090
So they took her away.

13:58.840 --> 14:00.888
You were never gonna let me go, were you?

14:01.080 --> 14:04.084
No, but I'd hate for you
to die on an empty stomach.

14:06.680 --> 14:08.091
Time to go.

14:32.120 --> 14:34.248
You need to call Damon
and tell him you lied.

14:34.440 --> 14:37.125
So I can lie for you all summer
as your witch translator...

14:37.320 --> 14:39.640
- ...but when it's something I want...
- Silas is dangerous.

14:39.800 --> 14:42.610
Bringing me back to life wasn't?
Oh, right, it killed you.

14:42.800 --> 14:45.770
- I brought you back because Elena needed you.
- Now she needs you.

14:45.960 --> 14:47.200
What about the consequences?

14:47.440 --> 14:50.922
Haven't we learned this by now? When you
abuse magic, there's always a price.

14:51.160 --> 14:52.685
What is worse than this?

14:54.640 --> 14:56.961
What is worse than seeing you...

14:57.640 --> 14:59.165
and hearing you...

15:02.520 --> 15:04.761
and not being able to feel you?

15:08.880 --> 15:11.360
This isn't enough anymore.

15:12.360 --> 15:15.011
Let Damon try to bring you back.

15:19.240 --> 15:22.767
<i>I know what I want</i>

15:22.960 --> 15:26.521
Wow. All of this and you weren't even
on the dance committee.

15:26.720 --> 15:29.485
I may have e-mailed them
a few suggestions.

15:30.400 --> 15:32.687
Did I mention
you're the hottest serial killer in here?

15:34.160 --> 15:37.004
Well, considering the crowd,
I'll take that as a compliment.

15:38.640 --> 15:40.529
I thought you got Stefan a costume.

15:41.440 --> 15:44.091
He's James Dean. I went easy on him.

15:44.280 --> 15:48.683
I figured between the bloodlust drama,
the Damon-Elena drama, the amnesia drama...

15:48.920 --> 15:50.251
he's been through enough.

15:51.280 --> 15:54.011
Hey. Dance with me.

15:54.200 --> 15:57.488
I'm buzzed and I'm on the verge
of having a good time.

15:57.720 --> 15:59.961
Have fun. I'll get us drinks.

16:00.840 --> 16:04.970
<i>But we get by with it</i>

16:06.240 --> 16:11.883
<i>Good girls do bad things</i>

16:12.080 --> 16:15.562
<i>Sometimes</i>

16:16.000 --> 16:17.889
<i>But we get by with it</i>

16:18.120 --> 16:19.406
Lady Anne Boleyn.

16:20.640 --> 16:23.723
Now who in their right mind
would out off a head so gorgeous?

16:23.960 --> 16:27.601
Uh, you, my king,
my not-so-loving husband.

16:28.080 --> 16:31.766
Well, maybe I can dance my way
out of this doghouse.

16:31.960 --> 16:34.930
Heh-heh. Yeah, maybe... Maybe later.

16:35.240 --> 16:39.802
Ooh. Or maybe you can tell me
what's going on with you. Come on.

16:41.640 --> 16:44.803
Bonnie died three months ago,
and what was I doing?

16:45.000 --> 16:48.766
I was having the summer of my life
with you.

16:48.960 --> 16:52.442
Ah, guilt. Don't know it,
but I've heard it can be a royal bitch.

16:52.640 --> 16:55.041
I know that it's not my fault
that Bonnie died.

16:55.280 --> 16:57.760
- But it is for not figuring it out sooner.
- Elena...

16:57.960 --> 17:00.327
you're allowed to be happy
once in a blue moon.

17:00.520 --> 17:04.047
- Besides, Jeremy was lying to us all summer.
- I should have figured it out.

17:04.520 --> 17:09.162
I know that it's not the same, but I'm not gonna
let Megan's death fall through the cracks too.

17:14.440 --> 17:17.125
- Who the hell is that?
- It's Megan's hometown friend...

17:17.319 --> 17:21.165
i. e., the latest person of interest in
the Whitmore mystery. I'll be right back.

17:27.680 --> 17:29.523
Hey, whatever your name is.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.968
Nice T-shirt. Understated.

17:32.160 --> 17:35.130
Ah. Hey, whatever you're supposed to be.

17:35.440 --> 17:36.601
Anne Boleyn.

17:36.800 --> 17:40.202
- Pre-beheading. Obviously.
- Impressed.

17:41.120 --> 17:46.331
So does a costume compliment
earn me, like, a formal introduction?

17:47.120 --> 17:49.202
Why do you wanna know who I am?

17:51.160 --> 17:53.686
- Did you kill Megan?
- Of course not.

17:53.920 --> 17:55.365
Why are you acting so shady?

17:56.200 --> 17:58.043
Because everyone around me dies.

17:58.320 --> 17:59.845
It's like a curse.

18:00.320 --> 18:02.243
My friends, my family.

18:02.720 --> 18:05.041
One by one, I've lost
every single person in my life.

18:05.880 --> 18:09.726
So if you had any idea what survivor's
guilt felt like, you'd leave me alone.

18:13.360 --> 18:14.885
Forget about my questions.

18:17.080 --> 18:18.730
It's, uh, Aaron.

18:19.720 --> 18:20.926
My name.

18:23.400 --> 18:25.289
I'll see you around. Maybe.

18:32.400 --> 18:34.721
<i>Up late at night all alone</i>

18:34.960 --> 18:39.329
<i>Can't you see I'm trying?</i>

18:40.760 --> 18:46.164
<i>Trying so hard to hold
on to the things I know</i>

18:48.080 --> 18:53.849
<i>But in the evening I will have to go</i>

18:54.040 --> 18:58.364
Where I come from, "open bar" meant
ceramic jugs of Phoenician wine.

18:58.560 --> 19:00.801
Mm. Okay.

19:02.320 --> 19:03.810
You have no idea who I am, do you?

19:05.240 --> 19:08.403
No offense, but actually,
I have no idea who a lot of people are.

19:09.680 --> 19:11.011
Tessa.

19:11.200 --> 19:12.725
Formerly known as Qetsiyah.

19:13.160 --> 19:14.446
The girl who wiped my memories.

19:14.960 --> 19:16.405
Yeah, nothing personal.

19:16.880 --> 19:18.450
A little ex-boyfriend drama.

19:18.640 --> 19:20.244
Let me make it up to you.

19:20.440 --> 19:21.930
Buy you an "I'm sorry" drink?

19:22.960 --> 19:24.610
More like an "I'm sorry" keg.

19:26.680 --> 19:27.966
Pardon us.

19:32.440 --> 19:37.606
- You, my brother, make a terrible wingman.
- The last guy that hit on her is still paying for it.

19:37.800 --> 19:39.848
So, what exactly are we doing here?

19:40.160 --> 19:41.525
Well...

19:43.240 --> 19:44.287
Hello, me.

19:59.640 --> 20:02.246
So you wanna explain to me
why I just killed my brother?

20:02.600 --> 20:07.606
Well, Tessa's spell mentally linked us. I lost
my psychic abilities. Stefan lost his memories.

20:08.760 --> 20:10.410
And the severed link?

20:12.200 --> 20:15.044
Yes, Damon, I can read your mind again.

20:15.600 --> 20:16.726
No, I'm not lying.

20:16.920 --> 20:21.448
And maybe you enjoyed breaking your
brother's neck just a little bit too much.

20:22.920 --> 20:23.967
Sold.

20:24.200 --> 20:26.726
I'll cozy up to the witch,
sift through her mind.

20:26.920 --> 20:30.720
Figure out where she's hiding the anchor.
All you gotta do is keep him dead.

20:30.920 --> 20:32.888
Isn't Tessa gonna be suspicious...

20:33.120 --> 20:36.283
when the man whose brain she fried
shows interest in her?

20:36.480 --> 20:41.486
Of all the men here, Tessa went straight
for Stefan. This face won her heart before.

20:42.080 --> 20:45.801
See, a woman
never forgets her first love...

20:46.120 --> 20:48.122
no matter how badly it ended.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.331
Look who's back.

20:54.480 --> 20:55.606
Am I in trouble?

20:55.800 --> 20:59.282
Well, according to my brother,
I am supposed to hate you.

21:00.080 --> 21:01.320
And do you?

21:01.760 --> 21:03.842
I'll tell you after that drink.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.401
- Good. You like tequila.
- Yes.

21:10.600 --> 21:12.284
But not as much as bacon.

21:12.480 --> 21:14.323
In my day, it was all about lamb.

21:14.520 --> 21:16.045
No one thought to cure pig fat.

21:20.960 --> 21:24.169
God, you have the most beautiful smile.

21:25.280 --> 21:27.681
Are you gonna stare all night
or ask me to dance?

21:27.880 --> 21:29.450
<i>I was standing</i>

21:31.800 --> 21:34.201
<i>You were there</i>

21:35.160 --> 21:38.846
<i>Two worlds collided</i>

21:39.400 --> 21:42.244
<i>And they could never</i>

21:42.680 --> 21:43.966
<i>Ever</i>

21:44.160 --> 21:45.525
You wanna get out of here?

21:45.720 --> 21:48.405
These costumes come with handcuffs,
and you have a single.

21:49.520 --> 21:52.729
Look, Care, I didn't just come back here
to get you in bed.

21:53.480 --> 21:54.527
I know.

21:54.720 --> 21:59.681
It's just a happy by-product of us
being in school together.

22:01.760 --> 22:03.808
No, I mean... Uh...

22:04.000 --> 22:05.161
What?

22:05.360 --> 22:08.170
<i>If I hurt you</i>

22:08.360 --> 22:09.885
I'm just really glad I'm here.

22:13.400 --> 22:17.724
So, what brings you
to a, uh, college costume ball?

22:18.000 --> 22:20.844
Look at me. Last time I looked
this good, I couldn't enjoy it.

22:21.040 --> 22:25.090
Oh, that's right. The whole, uh,
being-stood-up-at-your-wedding thing.

22:26.200 --> 22:27.531
You shouldn't know that.

22:27.720 --> 22:30.007
I told you that
before I fried your memories.

22:30.640 --> 22:33.450
Okay, you got me.
I might've asked around about you.

22:34.520 --> 22:36.648
- Heh-heh.
- And I'm paranoid.

22:37.920 --> 22:41.083
That's what I get for trying to marry
a lying, manipulative bastard.

22:41.280 --> 22:44.329
Oh, come on. The guy must have had
some redeeming qualities.

22:44.520 --> 22:48.002
I mean, we know he was obviously
extremely good-looking.

22:49.560 --> 22:51.528
But I mean, was the guy at least funny?

22:51.760 --> 22:53.000
Are you defending him?

22:53.200 --> 22:57.364
No, no, it's just that you've been
on this revenge kick for 2000 years...

22:57.600 --> 23:00.649
and maybe hating him is an excuse
to keep him in your life.

23:01.240 --> 23:03.720
Maybe there's a part of you
that still loves him.

23:05.160 --> 23:07.401
I really hope he thinks that.

23:07.600 --> 23:11.241
I wanna see his face
when he realizes just how wrong he is.

23:11.440 --> 23:13.920
Okay, I gotta admit,
there's a part of me...

23:14.160 --> 23:17.881
that just wanted to hear you say
that you still love me.

23:18.440 --> 23:19.771
That's how big my ego is.

23:20.120 --> 23:22.566
- But since you're obviously in denial...
- My God, Silas...

23:22.760 --> 23:24.842
You're okay. Now...

23:25.960 --> 23:29.601
- ...where's the anchor to the Other Side?
- Don't know. I'm looking for it too.

23:29.840 --> 23:31.444
What do you mean? You created it.

23:31.680 --> 23:34.524
Yes, I created it, but the Travelers hid it
after they killed me.

23:34.760 --> 23:36.091
They move it constantly.

23:36.680 --> 23:39.729
- What are you doing here?
- My pendant is in one of these displays.

23:39.920 --> 23:42.571
It's a magical talisman
that enhances my power.

23:42.760 --> 23:45.570
I need it to do a locator spell
so I can find the anchor.

23:45.760 --> 23:48.570
Well, then get to it.

23:48.760 --> 23:49.886
And...

23:50.840 --> 23:52.604
forget everything we just spoke about.

23:57.680 --> 24:00.126
- Thank you for the dance.
- Thank you.

24:01.680 --> 24:03.682
<i>You were there</i>

24:14.840 --> 24:16.251
Hey, hey

24:16.440 --> 24:17.965
Breaking my neck, huh?

24:18.160 --> 24:20.891
- Yeah.
- Pumping me full of vervain.

24:21.080 --> 24:23.162
All we need
is a Damon-sized rationalization.

24:23.520 --> 24:25.249
Oh, the new you sucks.

24:25.480 --> 24:27.721
How would the old me deal with this?

24:28.240 --> 24:29.526
Barrelful of laughs?

24:29.720 --> 24:31.131
He'd know it wasn't about him.

24:31.360 --> 24:33.362
Oh, who is it about, Damon, huh?

24:34.000 --> 24:38.164
About you? Your desperation to prove to
Elena that you're a worthy boyfriend?

24:39.840 --> 24:42.650
I'm gonna get her best friend back.
Okay?

25:04.280 --> 25:05.441
There you are.

25:09.040 --> 25:10.883
Having trouble getting that out?

25:12.080 --> 25:14.811
I grazed your heart on purpose.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.207
Which means you didn't want me dead.

25:17.880 --> 25:20.281
- You still want something.
- I do.

25:20.680 --> 25:24.048
I wanna know why you made up
that fake story about your mom.

25:24.960 --> 25:26.610
It was a test.

25:26.800 --> 25:28.086
You failed.

25:28.760 --> 25:30.922
I knew it was a fake story.

25:31.600 --> 25:35.889
By 1645, I'd been running from Klaus
for a century and a half.

25:36.120 --> 25:39.806
There's no way any of his minions
would have mistaken anyone for me.

25:42.600 --> 25:44.409
But you know how my brain works, right?

25:45.600 --> 25:48.888
So you must have known
that I wouldn't fall for that sob story.

25:49.080 --> 25:51.082
I wanted to get under your skin.

25:51.760 --> 25:53.091
And it worked.

25:53.320 --> 25:54.765
Because here you are.

25:56.240 --> 25:58.891
What kind of sick game are you playing?

25:59.080 --> 26:01.208
It's not a game, Katherine.

26:01.400 --> 26:02.890
You did kill my mother.

26:03.520 --> 26:05.010
Only it wasn't in Paris.

26:05.360 --> 26:07.522
It was in a little cottage in England.

26:07.720 --> 26:10.564
And it wasn't 1645...

26:11.040 --> 26:13.805
it was April 6, 1492.

26:16.280 --> 26:18.442
She was all alone.

26:20.200 --> 26:23.409
Exiled by her family two years earlier.

26:24.360 --> 26:26.681
You stuck her head in a noose...

26:27.480 --> 26:29.448
pushed her off the chair...

26:30.520 --> 26:32.443
and snapped her neck.

26:35.120 --> 26:36.963
Who are you?

26:37.160 --> 26:38.650
My name...

26:40.240 --> 26:41.924
is Nadia Petrova.

26:45.960 --> 26:48.327
And you are my mother.

26:59.200 --> 27:01.202
You look like a woman
on her way to the guillotine.

27:01.400 --> 27:03.926
Actually, she was beheaded with a sword.

27:04.400 --> 27:06.607
See? And that's why I teach bio.

27:07.520 --> 27:10.649
And you are Abe Lincoln?

27:10.840 --> 27:11.887
Dr. Jekyll.

27:12.840 --> 27:16.890
Ah. Heh. Okay, yeah, I can see that.
So where's Mr. Hyde?

27:17.080 --> 27:19.731
I don't know.
I'm not responsible for my darker half.

27:21.600 --> 27:24.843
So would it be totally inappropriate
if a student asked you to dance?

27:25.520 --> 27:26.885
Who could refuse a queen?

27:27.400 --> 27:28.561
Besides, you're not...

27:28.760 --> 27:31.240
nor will you ever be,
one of my students.

27:34.400 --> 27:36.084
Major points for the dance moves.

27:36.280 --> 27:39.887
But zero points for lying
on my roommate's death certificate.

27:40.080 --> 27:42.242
Look, I didn't wanna lie.

27:42.920 --> 27:46.288
I couldn't tell her parents a mountain
lion attacked her at a frat party.

27:46.800 --> 27:48.723
- I'd be fired.
- Huh.

27:49.400 --> 27:50.640
Wanna know my theory?

27:51.280 --> 27:52.361
What's that?

27:52.600 --> 27:56.810
I think a vampire hunted her down, ripped
her throat out and threw her off that roof.

27:58.240 --> 28:01.801
- What do you know about vampires?
- It doesn't matter what I know, Elena.

28:02.440 --> 28:04.329
We're never gonna
see each other again.

28:04.760 --> 28:06.489
And why is that?

28:07.920 --> 28:11.766
There are people at this school watching
you and your friends, asking questions...

28:12.000 --> 28:14.287
you don't want them to ask.

28:15.600 --> 28:16.647
So pack your things...

28:17.280 --> 28:18.406
drop out...

28:18.640 --> 28:20.961
and move back to Mystic Falls.

28:25.960 --> 28:27.291
<i>Hey</i>

28:27.800 --> 28:29.290
Here you are.

28:30.200 --> 28:31.247
What are you doing?

28:33.200 --> 28:34.929
Look, Care...

28:36.120 --> 28:38.043
I can't do the college thing
right now.

28:38.240 --> 28:40.208
Yeah, I completely understand.

28:40.440 --> 28:42.841
I have been pushing way too hard...

28:43.040 --> 28:45.805
and you need to make
your own decisions.

28:46.000 --> 28:49.447
The point is, you're back,
and we're together.

28:51.560 --> 28:53.642
Do you know the reason we're together?

28:55.800 --> 29:00.931
Because Klaus granted us permission
to be together.

29:01.120 --> 29:03.441
I'm sorry, but I can't live like that.

29:03.640 --> 29:05.085
I see.

29:05.920 --> 29:07.206
So this is about Klaus.

29:07.400 --> 29:09.448
No, this is about me.

29:11.040 --> 29:12.804
He killed my mom and got away with it.

29:13.000 --> 29:16.482
I can't just start caring about sociology
and frat parties...

29:16.680 --> 29:19.684
- You haven't given it a chance.
- I didn't come here to.

29:25.680 --> 29:27.648
You came here to say goodbye.

29:30.680 --> 29:32.330
I need to go after him.

29:32.520 --> 29:35.808
I need to find a way to destroy his life
like he destroyed mine.

29:36.040 --> 29:37.121
You know what, Tyler?

29:37.320 --> 29:40.881
For someone who hates Klaus,
you certainly sound a lot like him.

30:22.560 --> 30:23.891
<i>Ste'? an .</i>

30:24.440 --> 30:25.521
Come to see the show?

30:26.240 --> 30:27.526
What are you doing?

30:27.960 --> 30:30.645
Been using this pendant
to find something I'm looking for.

30:31.040 --> 30:33.247
- And I found it.
- Good.

30:40.640 --> 30:42.085
- Stefan?
- Aah!

30:52.240 --> 30:53.287
You awake?

30:59.160 --> 31:00.286
Stefan?

31:03.640 --> 31:05.483
Stefan?

31:06.800 --> 31:09.565
You alive again, huh?

31:19.600 --> 31:21.807
How's it feel, brother?

31:29.120 --> 31:30.326
<i>Ste'? an .</i>

31:31.960 --> 31:33.769
Stefan. Are you okay?

31:33.960 --> 31:35.405
Aah! Aah.

31:35.600 --> 31:36.931
That's Silas.

31:40.640 --> 31:41.971
No.

31:43.480 --> 31:44.527
Give me this.

31:47.160 --> 31:48.605
He's working with my brother.

31:48.840 --> 31:51.241
Everything he said to you was a lie.

31:56.240 --> 31:58.322
That's all he knows how to do.

31:58.920 --> 31:59.967
Lie.

32:00.160 --> 32:03.881
You know where the anchor is.
Too bad you won't be around to find it.

32:11.520 --> 32:12.806
You can't kill me.

32:13.000 --> 32:16.209
I don't have to kill you. Yet.

32:19.200 --> 32:20.326
You love me.

32:20.520 --> 32:21.646
You know you love me.

32:23.680 --> 32:24.841
I did love you.

32:27.040 --> 32:28.201
Then you broke my heart.

32:29.360 --> 32:31.362
And now I'm gonna break yours.

32:37.760 --> 32:39.683
Or at least stop it from working...

32:40.560 --> 32:42.562
so your blood can't flow...

32:43.360 --> 32:45.886
and your veins dry up...

32:46.880 --> 32:49.360
and you rot from the inside out...

32:50.040 --> 32:53.328
so the world can see you
exactly as you are.

32:54.760 --> 32:57.047
A cold, gray...

32:57.560 --> 32:59.085
hideous...

33:00.000 --> 33:01.365
monster.

33:24.240 --> 33:25.765
Where do you think you're going?

33:26.600 --> 33:27.806
- What?
- Give them.

33:28.200 --> 33:29.247
Come on.

33:30.520 --> 33:33.842
- I'm fine.
- He sighed, releasing the molecules of alcohol.

33:34.040 --> 33:37.726
You know, you sound like that dad
who thinks he's cool but isn't.

33:37.920 --> 33:41.891
Well, I'll settle for that very uncool and
mildly responsible legal guardian. Keys.

33:43.400 --> 33:44.447
Now.

33:49.440 --> 33:51.408
Can I have some money for a cab?

33:51.600 --> 33:53.602
I mean, you do manage my trust, right?

33:56.960 --> 33:59.930
I saw you talking to Elena Gilbert.
Do yourself a favor...

34:01.120 --> 34:02.246
stay away from that one.

34:02.800 --> 34:06.088
- Why?
- Because behind my very uncool exterior...

34:06.920 --> 34:08.489
I do care about you, Aaron.

34:10.280 --> 34:11.360
Whatever.

34:12.080 --> 34:13.127
Be safe.

34:18.880 --> 34:20.370
Oh, my God. Stefan.

34:20.560 --> 34:22.244
That ain't Stefan.

34:23.480 --> 34:24.811
Silas?

34:25.159 --> 34:28.164
- What is going on?
- Looks like Tessa had her way with him.

34:28.560 --> 34:31.643
So if that's Silas,
then he's not a problem anymore.

34:32.120 --> 34:33.167
This is a good thing.

34:33.840 --> 34:35.126
Actually, no.

34:35.480 --> 34:37.402
It's a very, very bad thing.

34:56.000 --> 34:57.365
You're a fool not to run.

34:57.680 --> 34:59.364
Silas will find you.

35:00.360 --> 35:03.170
Or he won't.
You're the one who said it.

35:03.360 --> 35:05.727
I'm pretty good at dodging
the diabolical ones.

35:06.200 --> 35:08.009
Besides, Silas...

35:09.320 --> 35:13.166
doesn't need me until he figures out
how to destroy the Other Side.

35:13.680 --> 35:15.523
If he cures himself before then...

35:15.720 --> 35:17.882
he goes back to being a witch.

35:18.320 --> 35:20.527
If he dies as a witch...

35:20.760 --> 35:23.206
well, he's stuck
in supernatural purgatory.

35:25.320 --> 35:27.288
There's just one outstanding question...

35:27.520 --> 35:30.490
that's just been nagging at me
for the last 500 years.

35:31.920 --> 35:34.526
Where were you in 1498?

35:34.720 --> 35:38.566
I don't know. I was 8. Why?

35:39.040 --> 35:42.647
Because by 1498, I'd escaped.

35:43.880 --> 35:48.169
Ditched the people that were chasing me
and I found my way back to Bulgaria.

35:50.240 --> 35:51.526
I searched every village...

35:52.560 --> 35:54.050
every cottage...

35:54.960 --> 35:57.042
but I couldn't find you.

35:59.960 --> 36:01.485
You went back?

36:02.240 --> 36:03.446
Yes, Nadia.

36:04.240 --> 36:06.925
I went back for you.

36:15.160 --> 36:16.605
It's nice to meet you.

36:45.480 --> 36:46.766
<i>Hey</i>

36:50.120 --> 36:51.167
<i>Hey</i>

37:04.320 --> 37:05.401
- Care...
- Wait.

37:05.600 --> 37:07.329
I've been thinking about it.

37:09.160 --> 37:10.969
And I've decided that...

37:13.320 --> 37:15.607
I'm not going to have
this conversation again.

37:16.640 --> 37:19.769
I can't just sit here
while I'm waiting for you to come back.

37:20.720 --> 37:21.960
I don't want that either.

37:22.160 --> 37:23.764
Then stay.

37:23.960 --> 37:27.328
Just be the love of my life.
Just love me more than you hate him.

37:29.400 --> 37:30.481
I'm sorry, Care.

37:32.080 --> 37:33.605
I can't do that.

37:36.640 --> 37:40.361
No. No, no,
don't you dare walk away from me.

37:40.560 --> 37:43.131
I swear to God,
if you take one more step, we're done.

37:43.360 --> 37:48.207
Okay? No more surprises. No more excuses.
No more chances. We are done.

38:30.880 --> 38:33.565
So Professor Blondie
knows about vampires?

38:34.240 --> 38:38.848
He said if I don't drop out of school, the wrong
people will start asking the right questions.

38:39.080 --> 38:40.684
Ugh. That's not good.

38:41.160 --> 38:42.207
What are you gonna do?

38:43.000 --> 38:44.047
I don't know.

38:44.240 --> 38:48.040
All I know is that finding the truth
about Megan isn't gonna bring Bonnie back.

38:48.240 --> 38:52.040
Yeah, well, neither is a desiccated Silas
in our living room.

38:52.240 --> 38:56.165
The only way for Silas to trade in his life
for Bonnie's, is if he's a witch.

38:56.360 --> 38:59.443
But the only way to become a witch
is to have the cure.

39:00.160 --> 39:01.207
Yup.

39:05.400 --> 39:08.847
- What?
- Now who could that be?

39:14.400 --> 39:17.563
- Why, hello.
- What's so urgent? I'm on the run.

39:18.120 --> 39:20.964
I don't exactly have time
for a pit stop.

39:26.600 --> 39:28.967
Or maybe I do.

39:29.240 --> 39:30.730
Maybe...

39:30.920 --> 39:32.968
I have all the time in the world.

39:35.120 --> 39:38.329
Katherine Pierce
eludes death yet again.

39:40.600 --> 39:43.763
And you two finally
did something right for once.

39:43.960 --> 39:45.121
How's it feel?

39:46.240 --> 39:47.401
Thrilling.

39:54.320 --> 39:56.482
Damon, no.

39:57.640 --> 39:59.802
- He needs the cure to be a witch.
- No!

40:00.640 --> 40:01.801
No!

40:02.240 --> 40:04.766
No. No, Damon.
No, Damon, please.

40:05.000 --> 40:09.164
He needs all my blood. It'll kill me, Damon.
Damon, please. I don't wanna die.

40:10.480 --> 40:12.005
I don't wanna die, Damon.

40:12.200 --> 40:13.770
I don't wanna die.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.047
Please.

40:18.680 --> 40:19.806
Goodbye, Katherine.

41:24.320 --> 41:25.560
Do you hear that?

41:31.200 --> 41:32.565
You've gotta be kidding me.

41:32.800 --> 41:35.041
Takes a licking, keeps on ticking.

41:46.080 --> 41:48.242
Am I in hell?
