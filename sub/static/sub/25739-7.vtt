-Marcia?
-(glass thunks)

09:26.082 --> 09:27.832
Marcia Clark? Hmm.

09:27.916 --> 09:30.999
Soledad (voice-over):
America's favorite,
Soledad O'Brien!

09:31.082 --> 09:32.332
(Soledad utters
vocal warm-up)

09:32.415 --> 09:36.041
1994. Mike's
imaginary little sick kid.

09:36.123 --> 09:37.540
Some other shit.

09:37.624 --> 09:39.707
These are just some of
the moments that have marked

09:39.791 --> 09:42.165
the first round of arguments
between old friends

09:42.248 --> 09:44.332
Phil Matarese
and Mike Luciano.

09:44.415 --> 09:47.248
Who will win this right now
is anyone's bet.

09:47.332 --> 09:48.832
Cameraman:
And we're off.

09:48.916 --> 09:50.415
-(scattered cheers, hoots)
-Fucking nailed it again!

09:50.499 --> 09:52.415
And I am so drunk right now.

09:52.499 --> 09:55.373
(electric rock guitar
riff playing)

09:55.457 --> 09:56.999
That's actually me on guitar.

09:57.082 --> 09:58.874
-Okay, okay.
Everybody, we're back.
-(gavel pounds)

09:58.957 --> 10:00.207
Do we have commercials
on this show?

10:00.290 --> 10:02.332
First up is, uh... Phil.

10:02.415 --> 10:05.207
Thank you, Honorable
Judge Mom From Malcolm
In The Middle.

10:05.290 --> 10:08.332
Folks, I like to think of myself
as a pretty good lawyer,

10:08.415 --> 10:11.999
but if we're talking about
father-son bonding, 1990s--

10:12.082 --> 10:14.165
Cable Guy!

10:14.248 --> 10:16.582
-I'm sorry. What?
-Ladies and gentlemen
of the court,

10:16.665 --> 10:19.707
my opponent here is
gonna wax poetic
about late-'90s

10:19.791 --> 10:22.373
divorce dynamics
of Liar Liar.

10:22.457 --> 10:24.999
And I can go on about
socioeconomic inequalities

10:25.123 --> 10:26.749
tackled in Mr. Deeds.

10:26.832 --> 10:28.707
We can spend the whole day
picking roses,

10:28.791 --> 10:30.707
but we keep dancing
around the thorns.

10:30.791 --> 10:31.916
What are you doing?

10:31.999 --> 10:33.248
We said we wouldn't
bring up clunkers.

10:33.332 --> 10:35.373
What's the matter?
Afraid of a little prick?

10:35.457 --> 10:38.749
Juror:
Cable Guy was straight-up scary
I mean, it wasn't funny at all!

10:38.832 --> 10:40.290
Juror 2:
We trusted you, Jim!

10:40.373 --> 10:42.248
-We trusted you!
-Marcia: Phil, Phil.

10:42.332 --> 10:45.582
-Ribbit! Ribbit! Ribbit!
-Oh, God. Is that Marcia Clark?

10:45.665 --> 10:47.749
Aah, this is gonna be
a whole thing, this trial.

10:47.832 --> 10:50.540
-Ribbit!
-(quietly): Marcia, I have
no idea what that means.

10:50.624 --> 10:52.540
(quietly):
"The Cypress and the Frog."

10:52.624 --> 10:55.207
-Remember?
-You never told me
what that meant.

10:55.290 --> 10:56.707
You know what?
I'm just gonna
keep going.

10:56.791 --> 10:57.791
It's fine.
(burps)

10:57.874 --> 10:59.582
Mr. Luciano's right.

10:59.665 --> 11:02.749
The Cable Guy is not a normal
Jim Carrey movie by any stretch.

11:02.832 --> 11:05.248
But taking chances
is what an artist does.

11:05.332 --> 11:07.082
-Hit that motherfuckin' slide.
-(slide clicks)

11:07.165 --> 11:09.290
-Goddamn it. What is up
with these clickers?
-(crowd gasps)

11:09.373 --> 11:12.415
Thank you. I'm gonna do
a real quick experiment, okay?

11:12.499 --> 11:15.791
I want everyone
in the courtroom right now
to close their eyes, please.

11:15.874 --> 11:18.165
(quietly): This is great. Now
I'll steal all their wallets.

11:18.248 --> 11:20.123
-No, Marcia, don't.
-Fuck you. Firecracker.

11:20.207 --> 11:21.624
-Judge: What?
Jesus Christ.
-(gavel pounds)

11:21.707 --> 11:23.499
Marcia Clark!
No firecrackers!

11:23.582 --> 11:26.624
Sorry about that, guys.
Close your eyes and
keep 'em closed.

11:26.707 --> 11:30.123
Just trust me, okay?
Now, by a show of hands,

11:30.207 --> 11:33.457
how many of you left the theater
after viewing The Truman Show

11:33.540 --> 11:34.957
and thought to yourselves,

11:35.041 --> 11:37.165
"What if I'm being Truman-ed
right now?"

11:37.248 --> 11:39.123
(Phil laughs)

11:39.207 --> 11:41.499
Now open your eyes.

11:41.582 --> 11:43.791
-Every one of you with
your hand up right now...
-Male: Wow!

11:43.874 --> 11:45.791
-...just took a risk
and it paid off.
-Male: I did it!

11:45.874 --> 11:47.916
-He's right!
-Just as my client
did with Cable Guy.

11:47.999 --> 11:49.457
-Thank you so much.
-(cheers, applause)

11:49.540 --> 11:51.332
I came out of that
movie with my daughter,

11:51.415 --> 11:52.707
I didn't trust her
for a week.

11:52.791 --> 11:55.499
Come on, that argument
doesn't make any sense!

11:55.582 --> 11:57.457
All right, screw it!
The gloves are coming off.

11:57.540 --> 11:59.290
You wanna talk about
Jim Carrey movies?

11:59.373 --> 12:01.165
What the farts was
The Majestic?

12:01.248 --> 12:03.165
-I'll tell you,
it was anything but!
-You wanna go down this road?

12:03.248 --> 12:04.999
All righty, then!
What about Spanglish?

12:05.082 --> 12:06.999
Fun way to flop
in two languages!

12:07.082 --> 12:08.457
Number 23? Yeah,
like the number of times

12:08.540 --> 12:10.123
I tried to sit
through that movie!

12:10.207 --> 12:12.373
Click? Certainly didn't
with audiences!

12:12.457 --> 12:15.165
Oh, fuck you! Yes Man ?
How about, No, Mama,

12:15.248 --> 12:17.123
I Don't Wanna See
a Worse Liar Liar Remake.

12:17.207 --> 12:18.832
Nobody does!

12:18.916 --> 12:21.999
They had the gall
to call that movie
Grown Ups?

12:22.082 --> 12:23.707
-Judge: Enough. Enough!
-Mike: That was the joke!

12:23.791 --> 12:25.540
Okay, enough!
Quit bickering, you two!

12:25.624 --> 12:28.874
You're reminding me
of Frankie Muniz and, uh,
one of the other ones.

12:28.957 --> 12:31.082
Hey, is he also
on The Middle now?

12:31.165 --> 12:33.499
It's just so weird
that they made another
show called The Middle,

12:33.582 --> 12:35.248
and it's exactly like
Malcolm in the Middle

12:35.332 --> 12:37.041
but with Ray Romano's wife
instead of me,

12:37.123 --> 12:39.207
and the janitor from Scrubs
instead of Bryan Cranston.

12:39.290 --> 12:40.916
-Mike: It's wild.
-Judge: It didn't do very well.

12:40.999 --> 12:42.332
-Did it do well?
-Nine seasons.

12:42.415 --> 12:44.082
-Phil: Nine seasons, Tim?
-Judge: No, come on.

12:44.165 --> 12:45.707
-No.
-There's no way.

12:45.791 --> 12:47.207
-Judge: Nine seasons?
-Bailiff: I know, right?

12:47.290 --> 12:49.582
-It's been on for nine seasons.
-But Malcolm only did seven.

12:49.665 --> 12:51.248
It's crazy.
Talk about injustice.

12:51.332 --> 12:53.373
All right, all right, all right.
That's it for this round.

12:53.457 --> 12:54.874
(mutters):
The fucking Middle.

12:54.957 --> 12:57.540
(classical music playing)

12:57.624 --> 13:00.373
Farts! He fucked me, Marcia!
That was out of line!

13:00.457 --> 13:02.540
Look, Mike may have stepped
out-of-bounds of what was right,

13:02.624 --> 13:03.874
but he turned the tables on you.

13:03.957 --> 13:05.582
Classic law maneuver.

13:05.665 --> 13:07.999
That, of course,
and bring your opponent flowers.

13:08.082 --> 13:10.332
And telling jokes to the jury,
they love that.

13:10.415 --> 13:11.749
-(coughs)
-Phil: Marcia?

13:11.832 --> 13:13.749
Marcia? Marcia, what's wrong?
Marcia, come here!

13:13.832 --> 13:15.749
It's just a tickle in my throat,
nothing to worry about.

13:15.832 --> 13:18.582
(sighs) Marcia.
When all this is over,
you and I are gonna have

13:18.665 --> 13:21.248
our mentor/men-tea time
in the fanciest tea room
in all the world.

13:21.332 --> 13:25.874
Both:
The American Girl Doll store
in New York City.

13:25.957 --> 13:27.582
That'd be nice, Phil.

13:27.665 --> 13:30.749
All right.
I'm gonna go get a drink.
I gotta blow off some steam.

13:30.832 --> 13:32.457
-See ya, Marcia.
-(door opens, closes)

13:33.373 --> 13:34.916
Smoke bomb!

13:34.999 --> 13:36.791
What are you looking at,
freshmen?

13:38.624 --> 13:39.749
(playing off-key)

13:39.832 --> 13:41.290
(glass rim squeaking)

13:41.373 --> 13:43.624
I'll take a beer shaken, please.
I don't like the bubbles.

13:43.707 --> 13:46.248
I guess more than
a few old habits from
law school die hard.

13:46.332 --> 13:47.957
-Phil.
-Put it on my tab.
Huh? I got it.

13:48.041 --> 13:50.041
-Bartender: All right.
-Didn't expect to see you here.

13:50.123 --> 13:51.916
Well, I needed
to blow off some steam.

13:51.999 --> 13:53.457
I was actually
talking to him.

13:53.540 --> 13:54.791
-You're talking
to me? Oh.
-Yeah.

13:54.874 --> 13:56.749
-Are you the bailiff...
-I am the bailiff.

13:56.832 --> 13:58.123
-You are, okay.
-Phil: Wow.

13:58.207 --> 14:00.415
It's good to have
a lot of plates spinning.

14:00.499 --> 14:02.665
Let me ask you a question.
Are you friends with the judge,
like, outside the court?

14:02.749 --> 14:04.957
-Oh, yeah. Very close.
-I've always wondered that.
You are?

14:05.041 --> 14:07.791
Have you ever said,
"Please be seated"
when you meant, "All rise"?

14:07.874 --> 14:10.582
-No. No, that'd be ridiculous.
-That'd be so embarrassing.

14:10.665 --> 14:13.123
'Cause everyone's sitting
and then it's like,
"What do we do, lay down?"

14:13.207 --> 14:14.457
All right, I'm gonna
let you guys talk.

14:14.540 --> 14:15.457
Please be seated.

14:15.540 --> 14:17.248
Wow, remember
law school?

14:17.332 --> 14:19.123
I mean, I guess
it was a master class,
but Gary Sinise taught us.

14:19.207 --> 14:20.791
That's enough
of the fucking
pleasantries.

14:20.874 --> 14:22.499
-(grunts)
-(glass shatters)

14:22.582 --> 14:25.248
-Whoa. You hit a duck.
-You were way out of line
with that Cable Guy shit.

14:25.332 --> 14:26.957
You're running more
of a smear campaign

14:27.041 --> 14:29.248
than a goddamn
commercial for Jif!

14:29.332 --> 14:31.082
Do you get it?
Like smear,
like peanut butter,

14:31.165 --> 14:33.123
and campaign,
like an ad campaign,
like a commercial.

14:33.207 --> 14:34.624
What's that?
What are you doing?

14:34.707 --> 14:37.041
Magic. I'm putting
on a show, Philly.

14:37.123 --> 14:39.957
That's what this is all about.
It's not personal, okay?

14:40.041 --> 14:41.791
You don't even care
about this!

14:41.874 --> 14:43.707
Listen, I love Sandler,
to death,

14:43.791 --> 14:45.499
but I'm trying to win
this trial for me,

14:45.582 --> 14:47.373
so I can get famous,
move to LA,

14:47.457 --> 14:49.665
and play adult dodgeball
with the cast of Riverdale.

14:49.749 --> 14:52.332
I don't even know
who you are anymore,
Luciano!

14:52.415 --> 14:53.832
-You gotta go, buddy.
-(Phil sighs)

14:53.916 --> 14:55.332
Come on,
you're security now?

14:55.415 --> 14:56.624
I am security.
You gotta go.

14:56.707 --> 14:58.165
All right,
I'm taking a bottle.

14:58.248 --> 15:00.707
Have a good
third act, Mikey.

15:01.791 --> 15:03.999
(quacks)

15:04.082 --> 15:05.791
You know, you can put
your duckling through college
by suing that son of a bitch.

15:05.874 --> 15:08.165
He doesn't even care
about Adam Sandler!

15:08.248 --> 15:10.624
(gulps, coughs, gags)

15:10.707 --> 15:14.707

in Jim Carrey's career.

15:16.749 --> 15:18.207

-(gasps) Dad?

15:28.123 --> 15:30.207
That's right.
It's me, Dad.

15:30.290 --> 15:31.832
You look a little down
on your luck.

15:31.916 --> 15:33.916
Thought I'd stop by
and pay you a visit.

15:33.999 --> 15:35.540
Wait, is this real?

15:35.624 --> 15:37.248
Why do you look
exactly like Mike?

15:37.332 --> 15:40.041
I don't know, that's
how you've conjured it
up in your head.

15:40.123 --> 15:42.082
Oh! Dad, I've always
wanted to ask you:

15:42.165 --> 15:43.874
Neither of my balls
dropped,

15:43.957 --> 15:46.373
and I should be
way past puberty by now,

15:46.457 --> 15:48.874
and I'm just wondering--
Why are you holding a camera?

15:48.957 --> 15:50.415
I love you
so much, son.

15:50.499 --> 15:52.207
-Wait. You're not a ghost?
-I love you so much, son.

15:52.290 --> 15:55.332

15:55.415 --> 15:57.041

I was having a vision!

Oh, fuck.
What am I gonna do?

17:03.373 --> 17:04.582
Huh?

17:04.665 --> 17:05.624
Hmm?

17:05.707 --> 17:06.791
Hmm?

17:06.874 --> 17:07.957
Come on, let's see
the rest of it.

17:08.041 --> 17:09.749
Yeah, you're right.

17:09.832 --> 17:12.832
You can't judge
an artist's ouevre
by just one part of it.

17:12.916 --> 17:14.957
You need the full picture.

17:15.041 --> 17:16.248
(crowd gasps)

17:16.332 --> 17:18.999
But what if the artist
stops making art?

17:19.082 --> 17:21.665
Look, we all love
Jim's early work,
but let's face it,

17:21.749 --> 17:24.624
after a while,
you couldn't count on Carrey.

17:24.707 --> 17:26.332
You couldn't count on Carrey.

17:26.415 --> 17:28.041
(panting):
I'm so tired of running.

17:28.123 --> 17:29.332
Please be
in your office, Marcia.

17:29.415 --> 17:30.874
Oh, shit. Oh, fuck.

17:30.957 --> 17:33.832
The Wedding Singer,
The Waterboy, Little Nicky.

17:33.916 --> 17:37.290
That, ladies and gentlemen,
is brand consistency.

17:37.373 --> 17:40.457
Adam Sandler himself
is an industry.

17:40.540 --> 17:42.165
I don't care if you didn't
like Grown Ups.

17:42.248 --> 17:45.499
That movie put David Spade's
niece through college!

17:45.582 --> 17:48.332
Marcia, I need your help!
I didn't prepare for this
closing argument at all,

17:48.415 --> 17:51.165
and I'm super drunk still!
What? Oh, fuck!

17:51.248 --> 17:54.665
Mike (in child's voice):
Did my buddy Adam
do good, Mr. Mike?

17:54.749 --> 17:57.207
(crying)

17:57.290 --> 17:58.832
(balloon squeaking)

17:58.916 --> 18:01.874
(in normal voice):
Adam done good,
little sick kid.

18:01.957 --> 18:03.582
Adam done good.

18:04.624 --> 18:06.207
♪ Ooh... ♪

18:06.290 --> 18:08.041
(sobbing):
Why, God?

18:08.123 --> 18:12.916
Don't make the little sick kid
one of your newest angels, God!

18:12.999 --> 18:15.707
-(pops)
-(cheering)

18:15.791 --> 18:18.165
Thank you. Thanks, guys.
Thanks so much. That was great.

18:18.248 --> 18:19.665
-(gavel pounds)
-A lot of fun, thank you.

18:19.749 --> 18:22.207
(laughs) Wow. I mean,
how do you beat that?

18:22.290 --> 18:24.207
Is that son of a bitch
Matarese here or not?

18:24.290 --> 18:26.248
Hey, hey! Sorry, Judge.
I'm back, I'm back.

18:26.332 --> 18:28.207
Closing arguments.
(chuckles nervously)

18:28.290 --> 18:30.165
Oh, boy! I...

18:30.248 --> 18:32.207
Times like this, I wish my balls
had dropped so my voice

18:32.290 --> 18:34.582
-would be more commanding. Fuck!
-Marcia: You can do it!

18:34.665 --> 18:37.499
Like Rob Schneider
in Waterboy.
"You can do it!"

18:37.582 --> 18:40.499
-You're alive?
-Phil, you're doing terrible!

18:40.582 --> 18:43.332
I thought you were dead!
There-- There was a body bag!

18:43.415 --> 18:44.749
Body bag?

18:44.832 --> 18:47.082
That was a duffel bag,
filled with all my stuff.

18:47.165 --> 18:48.707
I'm quitting the mentor game

18:48.791 --> 18:50.248
-'cause I sold
my children's book.
-(frog ribbits)

18:50.332 --> 18:53.123
-But there were cops there!
-Cops always help me move.

18:53.207 --> 18:54.540
When you're as famous
a lawyer as I am,

18:54.624 --> 18:56.582
I'm basically a veteran.
At ease, boys.

18:56.665 --> 18:58.582
Just concentrate on the case!

18:58.665 --> 19:01.290
Remember, The Cypress
and the Frog!

19:01.373 --> 19:03.415
Marcia, you never told
me the anecdote.

19:03.499 --> 19:05.248
That's it. If you're not
gonna buy the book, I'm out.

19:05.332 --> 19:07.582
You're officially
on your own, Matarese.

19:07.665 --> 19:09.749
FX paid better than this
fucking bullshit.

19:09.832 --> 19:12.082
I gotta start thinking
about me, myself, and I.

19:12.165 --> 19:14.624
I gotta start thinking
about me, myself, and I.

19:14.707 --> 19:17.248
Me, myself, Irene.

19:17.332 --> 19:20.791
Hurricane Irene.
Terrible. Terrible hurricane.

19:20.874 --> 19:22.791
2011 was a horrible year.

19:22.874 --> 19:25.082
Hey, do you wanna watch,
Me, Myself & Irene?

19:25.165 --> 19:27.624
Oh, my God. That's it!

19:27.707 --> 19:28.957
(Phil clears throat)

19:29.041 --> 19:30.415
(crowd gasps)

19:30.499 --> 19:31.999
Me, Myself & Irene?
This is a suicide mission!

19:32.082 --> 19:34.749
In some ways,
the oft-overlooked

19:34.832 --> 19:37.457
Me, Myself & Irene is
the perfect film.

19:37.540 --> 19:39.999
He's fucking crazy if
he thinks this is gonna work.

19:40.082 --> 19:41.749
Now, hear me out on this.

19:41.832 --> 19:46.624
Me, Myself & Irene
is indicative of our national
splitting,

19:46.707 --> 19:49.665
how we see ourselves,
how we see others,

19:49.749 --> 19:52.290
and how we and them
wish to be seen.

19:52.373 --> 19:54.457
-Juror: Wait, what?
-For three decades,

19:54.540 --> 19:56.999
Jim's given a voice
to the thing inside
of us that said,

19:57.082 --> 19:59.791
"Maybe I'm a little strange.
Maybe I'm a little weird.

19:59.874 --> 20:01.624
"Maybe I'm a little nuts.

20:01.707 --> 20:04.123
"But that's okay,

20:04.207 --> 20:06.957
because that's
what makes you, you."

20:07.041 --> 20:10.499
Even now, as an adult,
when I look back at those
classic Carrey pictures,

20:10.582 --> 20:12.457
it puts me at ease.
It makes me just...

20:12.540 --> 20:15.041
-(babbling)
-(crowd laughing)

20:15.123 --> 20:18.123
(laughs) That dumb
fuckboy's making me laugh.

20:18.207 --> 20:19.499
Do it. Do it!

20:19.582 --> 20:20.832
-No. No, no, no.
-Tim, Tim, do it.

20:20.916 --> 20:22.041
-Not me.
-Come on, buddy.

20:22.123 --> 20:23.665
(babbles)
Get a little wacky.

20:23.749 --> 20:26.707
-(babbling)
-Phil: Yeah, right? Come on!

20:26.791 --> 20:30.207
It's contagious
because it's your truth.

20:30.290 --> 20:32.165
Jim's not just a movie star.

20:32.248 --> 20:35.041
He's an example of
how to live a deeply true life.

20:35.123 --> 20:36.457
(cheers, applause)

20:36.540 --> 20:38.624
-But... But it sucks!
-(crowd boos)

20:38.707 --> 20:41.707
Me, Myself & Irene
was a bad movie, Phil!

20:41.791 --> 20:44.707
Mike, I don't wanna
fight anymore, dude.

20:44.791 --> 20:46.332
I love Sandler, I do.

20:46.415 --> 20:47.791
You Don't Mess with the Zohan.

20:47.874 --> 20:49.207
Funny People was amazing.

20:49.290 --> 20:50.999
Yeah. Funny People is great.

20:51.082 --> 20:53.874
Judd Apatow followed Knocked Up
with a Sandler love letter,

20:53.957 --> 20:56.916
and Judd Apatow only
mooches off of the best.

20:56.999 --> 21:00.082
You're right, Mike.
Judd Apatow does
only mooch off the best.

21:00.165 --> 21:03.082
"He was the funniest man
on earth. This is something
we can all agree on.

21:03.165 --> 21:06.332
We can debate number two
forever, but Jim will
always be the king."

21:06.415 --> 21:07.874
Is it on BrainyQuotes?

21:07.957 --> 21:10.707
No! It's been confirmed
by BrainyQuotes!

21:10.791 --> 21:12.207
Phil: That'll be
all from me. Thank you.

21:12.290 --> 21:13.832
-Thank you so much.
-Judge: What a comeback!

21:13.916 --> 21:16.499
Okay, that is the end
of Act Three.

21:16.582 --> 21:18.041
Jury, go into that room.

21:18.123 --> 21:20.540
The fate of these
two stars is in your hands.

21:20.624 --> 21:24.499
And also, whatever
happens in a jury room,
stays in the jury room.

21:24.582 --> 21:25.874
(laughs)

21:25.957 --> 21:27.791
-Have fun, go crazy. Really.

♪ ♪

21:32.665 --> 21:35.082
Psst! Hey.
Can I be the judge now?

21:35.165 --> 21:36.707
No.

21:36.791 --> 21:38.791
-Do you have games
on your phone?
-No, Marcia. Go sit down.

21:38.874 --> 21:40.248
Aah! So boring!

21:40.332 --> 21:41.540
(chattering)

21:41.624 --> 21:42.957
That's two cups.

21:43.041 --> 21:46.041
That's two cups.
Never prepared for the bounce.

21:46.123 --> 21:47.457
Drink, drink, drink!

cancel each other
out artistically,

21:52.123 --> 21:54.207
so they didn't bring
them up.

21:54.290 --> 21:56.582
-Yeah, I was wondering
why they didn't bring those up.
-Yeah, that's why. Yeah.

21:56.665 --> 21:59.707
Hey, Phil. Do you have
a can of Axe Body Spray
and a lighter?

21:59.791 --> 22:02.123
I saw this thing on YouTube.
It's fucking crazy!

22:02.207 --> 22:03.415
Phil: No, no.
Marcia, don't do that!

22:03.499 --> 22:04.457

(bell rings)

22:10.332 --> 22:12.665
(crowd murmuring)

22:16.373 --> 22:19.457
Ladies and gentlemen,
the verdict is in my hand.

22:19.540 --> 22:22.791
Tim, was this in your mouth?
It smells like dog food.

22:22.874 --> 22:23.957
Am I under oath?

22:24.041 --> 22:25.749
It was. It was
in my mouth, I'm sorry.

22:25.832 --> 22:27.499
Dogs mouths are
pretty clean, though.
That's a little known fact.

22:27.582 --> 22:29.123
Sorry about that.
Force of habit.

22:29.207 --> 22:32.791
After a lengthy,
thinly plotted Rat Court trial,

22:32.874 --> 22:36.582
the more impressive
comedic career goes to...

22:36.665 --> 22:38.499
(suspenseful music playing)

22:42.916 --> 22:44.332
It's Sandler.
Adam Sandler wins.

22:44.415 --> 22:46.540
(electric rock guitar
riff playing)

22:48.041 --> 22:50.248
-Aah, fuck!
-Fuck, yes!

22:50.332 --> 22:52.457
I feel it in my balls, baby!

22:52.540 --> 22:54.248
I feel the victory in my balls!

22:54.332 --> 22:55.248
I'm sorry, Jim.

22:55.332 --> 22:57.457
What do we got here?
(farting)

22:57.540 --> 22:59.332
Look at that,
he's shitting in the hat.

22:59.415 --> 23:02.165
Shit hats for
everybody! Woo!

23:02.248 --> 23:04.373

Mike, Mike. Soledad O'Brien

23:09.582 --> 23:11.874
You won in the courtroom.
How does it feel?

23:11.957 --> 23:14.165
(laughing) Sorry,
just being hilarious.

23:14.248 --> 23:16.041
Those are my boys over there.

23:16.123 --> 23:19.207
It's a great day for
justice and for people
who love Adam Sandler,

23:19.290 --> 23:22.540
which is, I think, all of us,
so America won today.

23:22.624 --> 23:25.999
And to my opponent, Phil,
I would just like to say...

23:26.082 --> 23:28.707
Suck my (bleeping)

23:28.791 --> 23:29.999
...dick! (laughs)

23:30.082 --> 23:32.290
Send that Carrey
motherfucker to jail!

23:32.373 --> 23:35.457
Lock him up! Lock him up!
Lock him up!

23:35.540 --> 23:36.999
Woo-hoo!

23:37.123 --> 23:39.832
God, I guess I'm famous now?
Bella Hadid, hit me up.

23:39.916 --> 23:42.707
Well, there you have it, folks,
a true winner.

23:42.791 --> 23:45.540
Hey, is that Marcia Clark?
Is she mooning me?

23:45.624 --> 23:47.207
-Judge: Hey, Soledad!
-Both: Fuck you!

23:47.290 --> 23:48.540
(laughing)

23:48.624 --> 23:51.332
Now they're here.
Now I wanna hang out.

23:51.415 --> 23:54.041
Sorry. Can I actually
say something? I feel like
I should be allowed to.

23:54.123 --> 23:55.999
Legally, do I have
to let him talk?

23:56.082 --> 23:57.540
Fine, here.
Here's the mic.

23:57.624 --> 23:58.832
-I'll be quick.
-All right. I'm out.

23:58.916 --> 24:00.582
Hey, Marcia!
Wait up, guys!

24:00.665 --> 24:03.165
I just have to say
Jim Carrey and Adam Sandler

24:03.248 --> 24:05.874
can both be American treasures
and they are.

24:05.957 --> 24:08.707
They've both given so much joy
to so many people,

24:08.791 --> 24:11.041
and, ultimately, isn't
that what it's all about?

24:11.123 --> 24:13.165
And plus, by the way,
Jim's from Canada,

24:13.248 --> 24:15.373
so it's kind of not even
an American treasure
sort of thing, that doesn't--

24:15.457 --> 24:16.916
He's like Mike Myers,
you know-- Oh my!

24:16.999 --> 24:19.582
Mike Myers would've been
so good for this!

24:19.665 --> 24:22.749
I just realized Eddie Murphy
would've won this!

24:22.832 --> 24:26.707
Okay, I'm starting to realize
that this whole exercise is
actually pretty silly.

24:26.791 --> 24:29.916
You know what? I think
I'm gonna devote my time
to the greater good now,

24:29.999 --> 24:32.123
maybe like inter-species rights
with the city,

24:32.207 --> 24:34.248
away from all this glitz
and the glamour.

24:34.332 --> 24:35.874
I think that's
where I'll be happy.
