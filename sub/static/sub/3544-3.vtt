00:02.160 --> 00:03.880
Previously on The Vampire Diaries:

00:04.000 --> 00:05.411
I'm Elena
I'm Stefan.

00:05.600 --> 00:08.570
<i>Love brought me to Mystic Falls.
Love drove me away.</i>

00:08.760 --> 00:10.330
I love you, Damon.

00:11.600 --> 00:13.523
- Silas.
- Hello, my shadow self.

00:16.600 --> 00:18.523
<i>But as new enemies reveal themselves...</i>

00:21.600 --> 00:23.364
<i>things are spinning out of control.</i>

00:23.560 --> 00:25.801
I know exactly what you're thinking.

00:26.040 --> 00:28.486
Silas is using his mind control
to find Katherine.

00:28.680 --> 00:31.206
You all know Elena Gilbert.
The girl I'm looking for...

00:31.400 --> 00:34.210
- ...looks exactly like her.
- What do you want with Katherine?

00:34.400 --> 00:37.131
I could tell you.
Wouldn't it be fun if it were a surprise?

00:37.320 --> 00:38.924
Why can't I get inside your head?

00:39.120 --> 00:40.880
<i>With so many unanswered questions...</i>

00:41.000 --> 00:44.891
- Somebody's already in there.
- Stefan's been suffering for months.

00:45.080 --> 00:47.447
<i>...Now the truth is about to be revealed.</i>

00:47.640 --> 00:51.486
Well, you're right, he was hungry.
I bet he still is.

01:23.680 --> 01:25.682
Hey, man, last call was four hours ago.

01:27.640 --> 01:30.371
If you want some coffee,
I could put some on or...

01:38.640 --> 01:41.405
Run. Run!

02:11.080 --> 02:15.881
You must have restless sleep syndrome or something.
It's like sleeping with a tornado.

02:19.480 --> 02:23.769
Hey. We were up all night.
You're exhausted. Come back to sleep.

02:24.280 --> 02:25.884
I had a dream about Stefan.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.126
Oh.

02:28.320 --> 02:31.688
It was more than just a pit in my
stomach this time, though. It was real.

02:31.920 --> 02:33.365
It was like I was there with him.

02:33.560 --> 02:39.124
I said it didn't bother me that you have some
psychic connection to your ex-boyfriend...

02:39.920 --> 02:43.049
but I don't need a play-by-play, Elena.

02:46.080 --> 02:49.926
You're right. It's weird. Sorry.

02:52.680 --> 02:54.205
Fine.

02:55.240 --> 02:59.564
Tell me. Whatever's in my imagination is 10
times worse than what's in your subconscious.

02:59.760 --> 03:02.445
It was just so vivid.

03:03.920 --> 03:10.724
I saw Stefan walking out of this bar. It had
a red awning and this broken neon sign.

03:10.960 --> 03:12.564
And he was screaming in pain.

03:12.760 --> 03:17.368
Well, should I go check in the attic
to see if there's a crystal ball?

03:17.560 --> 03:22.441
- Maybe you can conjure up an address.
- Route 29. Joe's Bar.

03:25.160 --> 03:27.128
I think I had the exact same dream.

03:47.880 --> 03:51.009
So I found nine bars along Route 29.

03:51.680 --> 03:55.321
And none of them are called Joe's.

03:56.520 --> 04:00.570
I had a feeling there was something wrong all
summer and I ignored it. But I was right.

04:00.800 --> 04:05.806
Stefan was in a safe and probably killed
whoever it was that found him.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.800
I know it sounds crazy
that I'm following some psychic dream...

04:10.000 --> 04:11.809
but it's the only lead that we have.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.844
It doesn't sound crazy, it is crazy.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.490
But I'm open-minded.

04:17.680 --> 04:19.204
Shotgun.

04:20.839 --> 04:23.650
What? I get carsick in the back seat.

04:23.840 --> 04:29.210
Another charming,
human side-effect you stuck me with.

04:30.160 --> 04:34.051
- Please tell me that she's not coming.
- I have no interest in Katherine's well-being.

04:34.240 --> 04:38.165
For some reason, Silas wants her real bad.
And if Silas wants her, I want her more.

04:38.360 --> 04:42.649
Can't we just stash her in the cellar? Or maybe
a deep, dark well with a pair of water-wings?

04:42.880 --> 04:45.850
Do you really think that I want
to take a road trip with you...

04:46.040 --> 04:49.010
America's most boring,
self-righteous vampire?

04:49.200 --> 04:53.250
Just remember,
Damon wouldn't have to play bodyguard...

04:53.440 --> 04:56.330
if you hadn't shoved that cure
down my throat.

04:56.560 --> 04:58.210
You were trying to kill me.

05:00.040 --> 05:02.520
I will admit, though,
I take great pleasure knowing...

05:02.720 --> 05:06.088
that you wasted your one shot
at a human life on me.

05:06.320 --> 05:09.847
All right, play nice, or I'm gonna
revisit the deep, dark well idea.

05:10.040 --> 05:13.089
I want to find Stefan
just as much as you do.

05:13.280 --> 05:17.171
And not just because I don't want to be a
pawn that you can trade off for his life.

05:17.360 --> 05:19.328
I care about him.

05:19.520 --> 05:20.601
I always have.

05:20.840 --> 05:22.922
And since we've been having
the same dream...

05:23.560 --> 05:26.086
makes me think
that you care about him just as much.

05:26.880 --> 05:29.281
Okay, train's leaving the station.

05:29.480 --> 05:31.005
<i>Choc-choc.</i>

05:32.080 --> 05:34.890
You ever play the "what if" game?

05:35.080 --> 05:37.208
When you're calcified for 2000 years...

05:37.440 --> 05:40.489
you learn to entertain yourself
with these little brain teasers.

05:40.680 --> 05:44.730
Look, Silas, this phone is prepaid
and I don't have a lot of minutes.

05:44.920 --> 05:47.082
No, no, no. It's really easy.
I'll go first.

05:47.320 --> 05:51.041
You know how much I hate Travelers,
so to prove your allegiance to me...

05:51.280 --> 05:55.171
you killed your Traveler friend Gregor.
But what if it was all an act?

05:55.360 --> 05:57.601
<i>What if he's still alive?</i>

05:57.800 --> 06:02.044
You saw him bleed out.
You buried his body yourself.

06:02.240 --> 06:05.449
But what if Matt's tacky ring
brought him back to life?

06:05.640 --> 06:08.246
If this is the game, it's boring.

06:08.440 --> 06:12.126
If we're gonna work together,
I need to know that you're on my side.

06:12.320 --> 06:15.722
So find out if Matt Donovan is still alive
and kill him.

06:15.920 --> 06:18.810
Fine. Say Matt is still alive.

06:19.280 --> 06:22.204
What if he could help us
to find Katherine Pierce?

06:22.440 --> 06:24.442
She's still your priority, is she not?

06:24.640 --> 06:25.801
Yes, she is.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.606
So get the information that you need...

06:28.800 --> 06:33.362
rip that ring off Matt's little finger,
and make sure he doesn't cheat death again.

06:34.480 --> 06:35.970
I'll take care of it.

06:56.760 --> 06:57.807
Don't want to hurt you.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.049
- Get away from me before I rip your throat out.
- Hello to you too.

07:03.280 --> 07:05.009
I brought dinner.

07:10.360 --> 07:14.331
A vampire doppelganger
who's burdened by a conscience.

07:16.360 --> 07:17.805
Now I've seen everything.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.924
You saved me from burning to death
outside that bar, didn't you?

07:25.120 --> 07:27.441
And I pulled you from
the quarry before that.

07:27.640 --> 07:31.361
That is, I figured out where you were,
and told the former owner of this cabin...

07:31.560 --> 07:34.040
to pull your lockbox from the water.

07:34.760 --> 07:38.082
You thanked him by biting off his head.

07:38.640 --> 07:42.964
- How do you know I'm a doppelganger?
- Because I've seen your face before.

07:43.160 --> 07:45.083
On someone who wasn't you.

07:46.880 --> 07:49.770
- Who are you?
- How much do you know about Silas?

07:51.520 --> 07:52.885
Huh.

07:53.640 --> 07:58.680
I know that he's a bloodthirsty immortal
who's killed more people than I can count.

08:00.080 --> 08:03.482
And that was before he stole my identity...

08:03.920 --> 08:07.561
locked me up in a safe
and dropped me in the bottom of a quarry.

08:08.240 --> 08:11.130
- You made it through.
- Barely.

08:11.320 --> 08:15.086
I came very close to flipping off
my humanity switch, but I didn't.

08:15.280 --> 08:18.762
Because I knew if I ever got out,
I wanted to be myself when I killed him.

08:19.440 --> 08:22.649
- Strong words.
- He's a monster.

08:23.600 --> 08:24.806
And I'm going after him.

08:27.440 --> 08:30.603
Except you'll burn to death in the sun
without your daylight ring.

08:34.080 --> 08:36.525
Silas wasn't always a monster.

08:39.240 --> 08:43.325
<i>He used to be a simple man
in love with a simple girl.</i>

08:43.960 --> 08:45.644
<i>His soul mate.</i>

08:45.840 --> 08:47.922
<i>She was his one true love.</i>

08:48.120 --> 08:51.124
Heh. You know how that goes.

08:51.360 --> 08:53.408
They thought their love would last forever.

08:53.600 --> 08:55.284
How do you know all this?

08:55.960 --> 08:58.008
Because I was there.

08:58.640 --> 09:00.290
In his arms.

09:00.480 --> 09:03.927
You're telling me
that you were Silas' one true love?

09:04.120 --> 09:07.442
- I would have done anything for him.
- That's impossible.

09:07.640 --> 09:11.326
- How are you here right now?
- Love bends the rules of possible.

09:12.360 --> 09:15.045
<i>Silas and I
were the two most powerful members...</i>

09:15.280 --> 09:17.044
<i>of a gifted people called Travelers.</i>

09:17.280 --> 09:20.921
<i>When we were engaged to be married,
we decided to reach even further.</i>

09:21.640 --> 09:25.486
I don't ever want to be parted from you.

09:25.680 --> 09:26.806
Even by death.

09:27.040 --> 09:30.886
<i>He wanted to find</i> a <i>way
for our love to last forever.</i>

09:38.440 --> 09:42.126
Yeah, look, I know this story.
Everything was great for Silas...

09:42.320 --> 09:46.166
until some witch named Qetsiyah or whatever
came by and screwed him over. Right?

09:46.360 --> 09:48.249
Wrong.

09:48.480 --> 09:50.209
You don't know the story.

09:51.720 --> 09:56.169
Silas convinced Qetsiyah that he loved her
so she would make the immortality spell.

09:56.400 --> 09:58.880
But when she found out
that he was just using her...

09:59.080 --> 10:01.651
she dumped him in a
tomb with the cure...

10:01.840 --> 10:04.286
hoping he would take it and die...

10:04.480 --> 10:08.690
because she had created
a supernatural limbo to trap his soul.

10:08.880 --> 10:11.804
Like any other sane, rational,
well-adjusted woman would do.

10:13.040 --> 10:15.327
Which catches us up to today.

10:15.520 --> 10:18.888
Now Silas wants to destroy
that supernatural limbo.

10:19.080 --> 10:23.483
Once the Other Side is gone, he can take
the cure, become mortal, and die...

10:23.720 --> 10:26.007
and finally pass on and find peace.

10:26.200 --> 10:30.205
Look, if you really are Silas' one
true love, and you're not dead...

10:30.440 --> 10:35.002
then why don't you just do us all a favor
and run off into the sunset together?

10:35.200 --> 10:38.044
Silas was my true love.

10:38.480 --> 10:40.448
I never said that I was his.

10:41.680 --> 10:43.603
I'm Qetsiyah.

10:44.760 --> 10:49.004
That sane, rational...

10:49.200 --> 10:54.286
well-adjusted woman
you seem to know so much about.

10:59.080 --> 11:02.209
Clearly, you've heard
the man's version of the story.

11:02.400 --> 11:06.928
The one where I'm a backstabbing lunatic
who ruined everything for Silas.

11:07.120 --> 11:09.771
A raging bitch witch
whose obsession with vengeance...

11:09.960 --> 11:12.850
created a whole new dimension
of suffering in the afterlife.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.530
What are you doing here?

11:14.720 --> 11:16.882
I thought you were dead
and on the Other Side.

11:17.080 --> 11:20.926
I was. For 2000 years.

11:22.400 --> 11:24.368
But I came back.

11:26.120 --> 11:27.326
For you.

11:37.880 --> 11:39.928
Sure you know what you're looking for?

11:40.120 --> 11:42.407
That last bar had a red awning
and a neon sign.

11:42.960 --> 11:44.564
I'll know when I see it.

11:45.160 --> 11:46.400
Me too.

11:46.640 --> 11:47.846
Didn't ask you.

11:48.040 --> 11:50.361
I'm just trying to make conversation.

11:51.520 --> 11:54.729
Anything to drown out the sound
of eggshells breaking.

11:54.920 --> 11:58.208
So, Elena, I couldn't help but overhear.

11:58.960 --> 12:01.566
You've been dreaming about Stefan
all summer?

12:01.960 --> 12:04.361
That must be really stressful
on a new relationship.

12:04.560 --> 12:08.485
Especially when you're having those kinds
of dreams lying in bed next to his brother.

12:08.680 --> 12:10.045
They weren't dreams.

12:10.240 --> 12:13.801
It was just a bad feeling.
Like something wasn't right with him.

12:14.040 --> 12:16.691
Oh, no, yeah, sure. I totally get it.

12:16.920 --> 12:19.127
There's still a connection between you two.

12:19.320 --> 12:22.005
Maybe deep down,
you know that he was your one true love...

12:22.200 --> 12:24.328
and breaking up with him
was a big mistake.

12:25.560 --> 12:29.963
Ignore her. As soon as the vervain's out of her
system, we'll compel her and put her on mute.

12:30.160 --> 12:33.960
Or maybe Stefan's been trying
to reach out to you all summer...

12:34.160 --> 12:36.561
but you've been too distracted
with Damon to help.

12:36.760 --> 12:39.570
So he reached out
to the person that he trusts: me.

12:43.800 --> 12:46.724
Nah, you're probably right.

12:46.920 --> 12:49.730
Elena and I had the exact same dream
on the exact same night.

12:49.920 --> 12:52.446
Why would that mean something?

13:03.120 --> 13:04.804
What the hell did you do to me?

13:05.440 --> 13:09.047
Look, I know you and your boyfriend
screwed with my head the other night.

13:09.240 --> 13:11.686
So who the hell are you
and what do you want?

13:11.880 --> 13:13.962
I'm here to keep you safe from Silas.

13:15.160 --> 13:16.969
Silas?

13:17.960 --> 13:19.371
What do you know about Silas?

13:19.560 --> 13:21.642
I know that he still wants you dead.

13:23.120 --> 13:25.282
You're gonna need to trust me.

13:26.280 --> 13:27.645
Okay?

13:34.720 --> 13:36.131
Gregor.

13:39.600 --> 13:42.524
I'm sorry.
But Silas was going to kill you.

13:42.720 --> 13:46.930
Doing it myself was the only way
to salvage the deal.

13:47.120 --> 13:49.043
I need his trust.

13:49.240 --> 13:50.601
So you slit my throat?

13:50.800 --> 13:52.643
You knew the stakes.

13:52.840 --> 13:56.526
It is why we put you inside the person
with the invincibility ring.

13:59.400 --> 14:01.129
So now what?

14:01.360 --> 14:05.570
I am just a passenger that you can call out of
Matt's head and put away whenever you want?

14:05.760 --> 14:10.641
I will find a way to make this permanent,
Gregor, because I love you.

14:11.240 --> 14:12.366
Okay?

14:12.920 --> 14:17.050
And I will do anything, anything for you.

14:24.960 --> 14:28.646
Tell me where you buried my body.

14:30.040 --> 14:31.769
Okay.

14:32.440 --> 14:39.164
But first, you will have to dial
your friend Elena Gilbert...

14:39.920 --> 14:42.844
and find out where Katherine is.

14:56.560 --> 14:59.609
Do you have a, uh, cell phone?
I have to make a phone call.

14:59.800 --> 15:02.041
There's no cell reception out here.

15:02.240 --> 15:06.882
And remember, I made it safe for you in here,
but I wouldn't go outside if I were you.

15:07.080 --> 15:11.881
No offense, uh, Qetsiyah, I'm having a bit
of a hard time believing what you're saying.

15:12.560 --> 15:17.600
Qetsiyah. Sounds so ancient time-y,
don't you think?

15:18.840 --> 15:20.524
How about "Tessa"?

15:20.720 --> 15:22.927
It's a little different,
but not so different...

15:23.120 --> 15:26.681
you wouldn't find it
on one of those souvenir key chains.

15:26.880 --> 15:30.521
So that's why you rejoined the land of the living?
Souvenir key chains?

15:30.720 --> 15:33.451
I'm here because the Bennett witch
lowered the veil.

15:33.880 --> 15:37.487
I saw an opportunity to make myself
a living, breathing mortal...

15:37.680 --> 15:41.082
and I thought, "Why not?"

15:41.280 --> 15:43.681
My hunters have failed in their task
to kill Silas.

15:43.920 --> 15:46.321
I figured it was time to handle things
in person.

15:46.520 --> 15:50.206
Well, 2000 years is a hell of a long time
to hold a grudge.

15:50.400 --> 15:53.131
You have clearly never
been left at the altar.

15:55.680 --> 16:00.083
<i>Like a lovesick idiot, I created
an entire garden for our wedding.</i>

16:00.280 --> 16:03.284
<i>And I made a spell that would
keep us alive forever...</i>

16:03.520 --> 16:05.045
<i>an immortality spell...</i>

16:05.240 --> 16:07.242
<i>so we would never have to part.</i>

16:07.480 --> 16:12.441
<i>Silas and I were going to drink the immortality
elixir as part of our wedding ceremony.</i>

16:13.200 --> 16:16.249
<i>But then everything around me
started to die.</i>

16:16.440 --> 16:19.967
<i>My wedding ﬂower,
the garden trellis, our harvest.</i>

16:20.200 --> 16:22.328
<i>And then I realized why.</i>

16:22.520 --> 16:25.490
<i>Silas had already used
the immortality spell.</i>

16:25.680 --> 16:28.126
<i>He was already drinking the elixir
somewhere else.</i>

16:28.320 --> 16:32.484
<i>He took what he wanted
and then the bastard abandoned me.</i>

16:33.840 --> 16:37.003
So call me a woman scorned,
or a vindictive bitch...

16:37.200 --> 16:40.761
or whatever label suits your story...

16:40.960 --> 16:44.169
but I thought I was his one true love.

16:46.200 --> 16:47.804
And he ripped my heart out.

16:48.720 --> 16:49.767
I'm sorry.

16:49.960 --> 16:53.282
I deserved a chance to look him in the eye
and make him understand...

16:53.480 --> 16:54.811
how much he hurt me.

16:56.440 --> 17:01.970
So I found him in the wilderness
with the woman he gave my immortality to.

17:03.280 --> 17:06.568
The woman he chose over me.

17:07.200 --> 17:10.921
<i>And just when I thought his betrayal
couldn't cut any deeper...</i>

17:11.119 --> 17:16.729
<i>I learned that his actual true love
was someone very close to me.</i>

17:18.920 --> 17:20.922
<i>My handmaiden.</i>

17:28.960 --> 17:32.442
Just as you are mine, I am yours forever.

17:32.640 --> 17:35.484
Because when I look at you...

17:37.960 --> 17:39.325
Amara...

17:43.520 --> 17:46.126
all I see is an angel.

17:52.080 --> 17:58.565
So Silas was the first version of me, and
your friend was the first version of Elena?

17:58.800 --> 18:00.802
Amara was hardly a friend.

18:01.800 --> 18:03.768
When they drank the immortality elixir...

18:03.960 --> 18:07.328
they violated the natural law
that all living things must die.

18:08.160 --> 18:10.162
So nature found a balance...

18:10.400 --> 18:12.562
by creating mortal shadow-selves.

18:12.760 --> 18:13.966
Doppelgangers.

18:14.640 --> 18:15.687
Like you.

18:17.160 --> 18:19.322
And Katherine and Elena.

18:19.520 --> 18:24.208
All caused by the ripple effect
from Silas and Amara's sin.

18:30.480 --> 18:34.804
You wanna tell me what the hell
you've been doing this whole time?

18:35.000 --> 18:37.446
Silas stole your daylight ring.

18:37.640 --> 18:39.130
You're going to need a new one.

18:41.760 --> 18:45.481
When this is ready, I need your help
to take down Silas once and for all.

19:01.240 --> 19:03.322
Are we really just gonna leave her
in the car?

19:03.520 --> 19:08.321
Only time she shuts up is when she's sleeping.
I didn't wanna disturb our peace and quiet.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.446
- I thought you said this was the one.
- It is.

19:14.640 --> 19:17.484
It looks exactly like it did in the dream.

19:17.960 --> 19:20.201
Isn't that a little freaky?

19:20.400 --> 19:23.404
Yeah. It's a lot of freaky.

19:23.640 --> 19:25.483
Let's go see if Stefan's inside.

19:28.200 --> 19:29.645
Can I get you something?

19:29.840 --> 19:31.569
Yeah. Sure.

19:32.760 --> 19:35.923
Why don't you tell me
what happened to your neck, Jo?

19:38.760 --> 19:40.046
Some sicko attacked me.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.364
He bit me, told me to run, so I did.

19:42.560 --> 19:45.643
- And when I looked back, he was on fire.
- The sun must have come up.

19:45.840 --> 19:48.605
- He doesn't have his daylight ring.
- And then what happened?

19:48.800 --> 19:51.167
Some woman shoved him into a truck,
drove away.

19:51.360 --> 19:53.169
- Did you know this woman?
- No.

19:53.360 --> 19:57.888
She was driving Cam Peterson's truck. He lives
about 10 miles down that dirt road out back.

19:58.080 --> 20:01.050
Here. Heh.
You look like you could use one of these.

20:03.240 --> 20:05.447
I could. Thank you.

20:11.680 --> 20:14.445
- Vervain.
- What did you do?

20:14.640 --> 20:17.928
I told her to pour him a
drink or I'd kill her.

20:18.480 --> 20:19.720
Who the hell are you?

20:25.520 --> 20:27.249
Which one of you is Katherine Pierce?

20:27.440 --> 20:29.363
She is.

20:29.560 --> 20:31.881
Katherine's a compulsive liar.

20:32.120 --> 20:33.281
But I need her alive.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.002
Katherine, run!

20:38.120 --> 20:40.122
You really do look exactly alike.

20:49.800 --> 20:51.006
Wonderful.

20:51.200 --> 20:53.521
Now we've got a vampire bounty hunter
to deal with.

20:53.720 --> 20:56.121
Let me guess,
Euro-bitch was not part of the dream.

20:56.320 --> 20:57.606
I've never seen her before.

20:57.800 --> 21:01.486
Whoever she was, she wants Katherine,
which means she's probably a Silas spy.

21:01.680 --> 21:03.284
I'll go chase after her.

21:03.480 --> 21:06.802
- You find Stefan.
- Wait, what? No, she almost killed you.

21:07.720 --> 21:11.008
We don't have time for a detour.
Damon, Stefan's hurt.

21:11.240 --> 21:15.609
- Find him.
- Wait, no, stop. Just wait.

21:15.800 --> 21:18.041
Any sign of trouble, you let her go.

21:18.240 --> 21:21.210
Do you understand me?
I don't care how bad Silas wants Katherine.

21:21.400 --> 21:25.246
She's not worth a hair on your head.
You got me? Okay?

21:25.440 --> 21:27.044
Kiss me.

21:28.400 --> 21:29.686
Go.

21:32.360 --> 21:34.442
Hovering actually slows down the process.

21:35.160 --> 21:37.766
Ah. Got it.

21:38.440 --> 21:40.010
So, what's your, uh, plan?

21:40.200 --> 21:43.647
Take the cure and shove it down
Silas' throat and kill him?

21:43.840 --> 21:45.683
You're skipping ahead.

21:45.880 --> 21:49.043
We don't stand a chance against Silas
with his mental powers.

21:49.280 --> 21:52.124
- You took him down before, right?
- A long time ago.

21:52.320 --> 21:55.529
That was before he could compel masses.

21:56.520 --> 22:00.605
And 2000 years
of consuming dribbles of blood...

22:00.800 --> 22:03.690
from thousands of people...

22:04.760 --> 22:07.411
it's allowed him to hone his skills.

22:08.440 --> 22:10.966
Prepared him to escape
from the tomb I put him in.

22:11.160 --> 22:15.529
Is that where Amara is right now?
Locked away in a tomb?

22:15.720 --> 22:19.566
No, Stefan. Amara is not locked in a tomb.

22:25.720 --> 22:27.722
What are you doing here?

22:32.400 --> 22:34.004
I brought you two gifts.

22:36.040 --> 22:40.807
The first is the chalice
from which we were to drink at our wedding.

22:46.960 --> 22:50.203
I know you must be very angry with me.

22:51.640 --> 22:52.880
I was.

22:53.840 --> 22:54.921
For a time.

22:56.520 --> 23:00.889
But then I realized
it was within my power to forgive you.

23:01.520 --> 23:03.841
By creating this.

23:04.240 --> 23:06.322
Your second gift.

23:07.960 --> 23:10.008
A cure for immortality.

23:14.880 --> 23:16.882
That's not possible.

23:17.600 --> 23:19.841
I promise you, it works.

23:20.080 --> 23:23.050
I just used it on someone else immortal.

23:25.720 --> 23:27.085
What did you do?

23:32.240 --> 23:33.924
Amara.

23:40.120 --> 23:41.565
No.

23:41.760 --> 23:44.604
Amara. No.

23:45.200 --> 23:47.885
Amara. No. No.

23:51.440 --> 23:54.284
She couldn't speak after I cut her throat.

23:58.440 --> 24:00.090
But I could tell...

24:01.120 --> 24:03.726
by the way her heart was beating...

24:06.760 --> 24:08.410
she knew she was going to die.

24:10.840 --> 24:13.446
I Will kill you. I Will kill you.

24:13.680 --> 24:15.205
You will not come near me...

24:15.400 --> 24:18.483
unless you take the cure
and give up your immortality.

24:26.640 --> 24:29.371
Take the cure, Silas.

24:32.240 --> 24:36.211
We can live long human lives together.

24:39.320 --> 24:41.800
Can't say I didn't give
him a second chance.

24:42.040 --> 24:45.522
- That's what you call a second chance?
- I'm a complicated person.

24:47.440 --> 24:50.011
But Silas remains a simple man.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.731
I created the Other Side
as a supernatural barrier...

24:56.920 --> 25:01.960
between Silas
and the peaceful afterlife he craved.

25:02.160 --> 25:04.367
Then I dropped him in that tomb
with that cure...

25:04.600 --> 25:08.605
thinking eventually he would take it
and kill himself to be with Amara...

25:08.800 --> 25:13.567
just so he could realize that he
was caught with me for all eternity.

25:15.360 --> 25:16.850
How's that working out for you?

25:17.880 --> 25:19.962
He's been a little stubborn.

25:20.200 --> 25:26.207
I take it you're not really making me
a daylight ring, are you?

25:27.560 --> 25:31.360
Do you really think I'd give you the one
thing you need to walk out of here?

25:31.560 --> 25:34.325
We're on the same side.
I want Silas gone as much as you do.

25:34.520 --> 25:39.924
Have you not been listening to me?
I have trust issues.

25:41.400 --> 25:43.687
I'm controlling.

25:44.280 --> 25:46.248
And paranoid.

25:47.080 --> 25:48.730
And a little crazy.

26:01.840 --> 26:05.003
And that's working out just fine.

26:25.600 --> 26:28.888
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but I'm really glad it's you.

26:30.920 --> 26:36.006
My leg is cramping and I'm freezing.
Do you mind if I, uh...?

26:36.200 --> 26:37.406
Can I borrow your sweater?

26:37.600 --> 26:39.443
Let's go, before she doubles back.

26:40.240 --> 26:41.605
Why didn't you kill me?

26:44.720 --> 26:46.848
If Silas wants you,
that means you're leverage.

26:47.080 --> 26:49.686
No, I mean after you shoved the cure
down my throat.

26:49.880 --> 26:52.451
I was trying to kill you.
Why didn't you finish me off?

26:52.960 --> 26:55.167
You think that because we share
the same dreams...

26:55.360 --> 26:57.522
and both care about Stefan,
that we're alike.

26:57.760 --> 27:00.411
But we're not. I value my humanity.

27:00.600 --> 27:02.045
Which is why I let you live.

27:02.240 --> 27:05.687
To give you a chance to find
whatever shred of humanity is buried...

27:05.880 --> 27:07.882
underneath 500 years of bad behavior.

27:08.080 --> 27:12.324
Or maybe you thought that being human
was punishment worse than death for me.

27:12.560 --> 27:15.484
No. That was just a happy accident.

27:17.840 --> 27:19.444
Well...

27:19.640 --> 27:20.766
thank you.

27:22.480 --> 27:24.562
I'm glad to know that you care.

27:24.760 --> 27:26.603
Even if you are a condescending bitch.

27:28.320 --> 27:32.041
- Do I have to knock you out too?
- Not necessary.

27:42.480 --> 27:44.289
Stefan?

27:45.320 --> 27:46.651
You couldn't call a brother?

27:48.120 --> 27:51.283
- Nice to see you too, Damon.
- What the hell is going on here?

27:51.520 --> 27:56.208
Well, Silas' ex-girlfriend decided
to come back from the Other Side.

27:56.440 --> 27:58.363
Qetsi-whatever? Unh.

27:59.800 --> 28:01.768
It's Qetsiyah.

28:02.840 --> 28:05.241
Do you see why I want to change it?

28:07.760 --> 28:09.728
You won't be able to break those vines.

28:09.920 --> 28:13.322
The spell won't release him
until I get what I want.

28:15.160 --> 28:16.844
Well, I guess the rumors are true.

28:17.040 --> 28:19.486
You are a ray of sunshine.

28:19.680 --> 28:22.809
why is my brother wearing
your compost pile?

28:23.000 --> 28:24.843
I'm going to link Stefan to Silas.

28:25.040 --> 28:28.840
Casting a spell on his doppelganger
will neutralize Silas' mental powers.

28:29.040 --> 28:32.044
Once he's weakened,
I will force him to take the cure.

28:32.240 --> 28:34.811
That's a great idea.
Force the cure down his throat.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.844
The cure's gone. Done. It's ingested.

28:38.040 --> 28:40.691
Katherine, you mean.
I'm aware of her condition.

28:40.880 --> 28:42.564
She was supposed to be with you.

28:44.560 --> 28:47.882
- Wait. Katherine took the cure?
- We have a lot to catch up on, Stefan.

28:49.280 --> 28:52.090
Wait a minute, what do you mean,
supposed to be with me?

28:56.720 --> 28:58.085
Did you plant those dreams?

29:01.000 --> 29:04.243
- What is that, some kind of witch party trick?
- So where is she?

29:04.440 --> 29:06.568
We ran into a little snag.

29:08.480 --> 29:11.723
Hmm. Then I'll get started without her.

29:19.720 --> 29:23.930
Okay, thanks for the hospitality, but, uh, we
should really get going if we wanna beat traffic.

29:24.120 --> 29:26.771
Yup. Yup, he's right.

29:27.880 --> 29:30.201
Probably don't wanna get on my bad side.

29:30.400 --> 29:33.927
You realize you're not the only one
with a bad side, right?

29:34.920 --> 29:36.251
Aren't you brave?

29:37.240 --> 29:40.483
Without Silas' mental powers,
he is an immortal nobody.

29:40.680 --> 29:44.401
We can defeat him. Isn't
that what you want?

29:44.600 --> 29:46.125
Just do it, all right?

29:48.640 --> 29:50.608
Just get it over with.

29:50.800 --> 29:51.926
Do it.

29:52.120 --> 29:56.284
Sorry to sound like a broken record, but I
like to know the identity of my kidnappers.

29:56.520 --> 29:59.410
Who are you? And what do you want?

29:59.600 --> 30:02.524
Ask me again and I'll sew your mouth shut.

30:04.520 --> 30:06.841
Silas. Of course it's you.

30:07.040 --> 30:08.121
What are you doing here?

30:08.360 --> 30:09.964
GPS tracker.

30:11.640 --> 30:13.483
It's even better than a locator spell.

30:28.680 --> 30:33.288
- Thank you for working so quickly, Nadia.
- I'm not ready to hand her over yet.

30:33.480 --> 30:34.606
Oh, that's right.

30:34.800 --> 30:37.610
Your fascinating unfinished business
that I don't care about.

30:37.800 --> 30:40.849
- Get out of my head.
- What are you two talking about?

30:44.160 --> 30:45.810
Let go of her arm.

30:50.640 --> 30:53.211
Now I want you to pull out your gun...

30:55.400 --> 30:57.084
and aim it at your heart.

31:06.400 --> 31:08.050
Good.

31:09.360 --> 31:10.407
Now pull...

31:12.760 --> 31:14.250
the trig...

31:21.920 --> 31:24.207
Seriously. What is going on?

31:38.400 --> 31:40.084
What are you doing to my brother?

31:40.280 --> 31:42.282
Frying Silas' brain.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.411
No one said it would be pretty.

31:57.400 --> 31:58.686
All right. We're done here.

31:58.880 --> 32:02.566
You're right. We're done.

32:02.760 --> 32:03.886
It worked.

32:08.560 --> 32:11.928
Stef. Stefan. Stef.

32:12.120 --> 32:13.770
Damn it.

32:14.720 --> 32:17.451
- Whatever you did to him, undo it.
- Relax.

32:17.640 --> 32:20.450
I just burned through his conscious mind.
He'll wake.

32:20.640 --> 32:21.721
Eventually.

32:23.560 --> 32:25.164
You sure you want to take him home?

32:25.360 --> 32:28.682
You and Elena were doing so well
without your guilt getting in the way.

32:28.920 --> 32:32.208
- Spying on us from the Other Side?
- Don't flatter yourself.

32:32.400 --> 32:34.448
It was like watching a soap opera.

32:35.160 --> 32:38.721
Except boring and with no volume control.

32:38.920 --> 32:41.730
There was one thing worse
than being on the Other Side...

32:41.920 --> 32:43.763
and watching Silas resist the cure.

32:44.240 --> 32:48.609
Oh, yeah? What was that?
Realizing that your plan totally sucked?

32:51.800 --> 32:57.523
Century after century, I watched versions
of Stefan and Elena find each other.

32:58.280 --> 33:00.442
Like magnets. Always the same story.

33:00.640 --> 33:03.769
Conquering all, falling in love.

33:06.520 --> 33:09.603
You didn't think your brother
was Silas' first shadow?

33:13.200 --> 33:16.522
Destiny has been trying
to get the doppelgangers together forever.

33:18.480 --> 33:23.441
Look here, Miss Crazy. Why don't we just
dial down the destiny talk a notch, okay?

33:24.640 --> 33:28.008
You don't wanna hear it,
but the universe is working against you.

33:28.200 --> 33:32.330
If you're trying to downplay your reputation
as a psychopath, you might not wanna say...

33:32.520 --> 33:36.650
- ...you're spokesperson for the universe.
- You and I are the same, Damon.

33:38.160 --> 33:40.970
The obstacle standing between two fates.

33:42.040 --> 33:46.489
Silas had his true love
and Stefan has Elena.

33:48.240 --> 33:51.369
We're merely the conflict
that makes it interesting.

33:51.560 --> 33:52.971
So, what are you suggesting?

33:53.160 --> 33:56.164
I leave him here with you
and live happily ever after with Elena?

33:56.360 --> 33:57.850
I'd keep him safe.

33:58.040 --> 34:00.930
- You have a bad track record with men.
- I want to keep him safe.

34:01.120 --> 34:04.010
Now that he's linked to Silas,
Silas can't mess with our heads.

34:04.200 --> 34:08.569
And as long as Stefan's in the way,
you will never be with Elena.

34:13.239 --> 34:16.847
Take it from the woman
who's had front row seats for 2000 years.

34:20.719 --> 34:24.406
- No one would have to know?
- No one has to know.

34:30.679 --> 34:33.206
Or you could just go back to hell.

34:43.760 --> 34:45.364
Stefan.

34:48.560 --> 34:50.130
Stefan?

34:52.080 --> 34:53.889
<i>Ste'? an .</i>

34:54.440 --> 34:57.091
Oh, Stefan. Hey.

34:57.320 --> 34:58.845
Stefan. Hey.

34:59.040 --> 35:00.451
Stefan, can you hear me?

35:02.160 --> 35:03.730
<i>Ste'? an .</i>

35:04.800 --> 35:07.724
Wake up. Oh, God.

35:23.080 --> 35:24.445
Fine. I was snooping.

35:25.040 --> 35:27.122
Trying to find a passport
or a business card...

35:27.320 --> 35:31.041
or maybe even a parking ticket,
because you won't tell me who you are.

35:35.360 --> 35:36.885
You said you were hungry.

35:37.080 --> 35:39.811
For food. Not packaged poison.

35:40.560 --> 35:41.971
Ah. Suit yourself.

35:47.200 --> 35:49.851
Silas the Betrayer.

35:50.080 --> 35:52.367
Someone lived up to his reputation today.

35:53.880 --> 35:54.927
Where are you?

35:55.120 --> 35:56.531
Wouldn't you like to know?

35:56.760 --> 35:58.967
I may not be able
to read your mind anymore...

35:59.160 --> 36:02.243
It's too bad you lost the one thing
that made you interesting.

36:02.440 --> 36:06.331
But that won't stop me from killing you
if you don't hold up your end of the deal.

36:06.520 --> 36:10.650
Now, whatever twisted fantasy you're
playing out with Katherine is your issue.

36:10.840 --> 36:13.320
<i>- But she stays alive.
- We'll</i> see.

36:13.560 --> 36:14.800
That wasn't a question.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.844
As you mentioned earlier,
Katherine is still my priority.

36:18.040 --> 36:22.090
And since I lost my psychic abilities,
that can only mean one thing.

36:22.320 --> 36:25.688
My ex-fiancée is alive again
and she's on her way to Mystic Falls.

36:25.880 --> 36:27.848
<i>Well, maybe you two will get back together.</i>

36:28.080 --> 36:32.483
Heh. Reconciliation isn't really her thing.

36:33.240 --> 36:36.483
<i>She hates me as much as I hate her.</i>

36:36.680 --> 36:40.401
<i>And if you think that I don't play fair,
wait till you see what she's capable of.</i>

36:40.600 --> 36:44.161
<i>Because Qetsiyah and I
have some common ground.</i>

36:44.360 --> 36:47.523
Neither one of us will stop
until we get what we want.

36:47.760 --> 36:51.242
<i>And both of us want the cure.</i>

36:53.520 --> 36:56.524
Enough with the games, Silas.
What do you want with me?

36:56.720 --> 36:58.529
God, you know what's funny?

36:58.720 --> 37:01.371
The love of my life looked
exactly like you...

37:01.560 --> 37:06.088
and yet, the mere thought of your face
makes me want to vomit.

37:07.760 --> 37:11.651
I don't know what you're talking about, but
if I'm nothing but a gag reflex to you...

37:11.840 --> 37:14.081
why not cut me loose
and we can call it a day?

37:14.280 --> 37:15.850
Because the cure still exists.

37:16.080 --> 37:19.846
And I still want it. It's just running
through your veins right now.

37:20.040 --> 37:22.930
Your blood is the cure, Katherine.

37:23.600 --> 37:26.206
<i>Does that clear things up for you?</i>

37:50.760 --> 37:52.888
- Hello?
<i>- It's</i> me.

37:53.120 --> 37:55.407
I just wanted to let you know
that we found Stefan.

37:55.600 --> 37:58.126
<i>Unfortunately, we lost Katherine
along the way.</i>

38:00.560 --> 38:05.088
Hey, are you okay?
You sounded weird on the phone earlier.

38:05.280 --> 38:07.248
- I was worried.
<i>- Wait.</i>

38:08.280 --> 38:11.409
We talked on the phone today? When?

38:13.320 --> 38:17.450
You called and asked me if we'd found
Stefan and if Katherine was safe.

38:17.640 --> 38:19.847
<i>I told you where we were headed.</i>

38:21.480 --> 38:23.323
<i>You don't remember?</i>

38:31.640 --> 38:35.929
Yeah, yeah, I remember.
Um, can I call you back tomorrow?

38:36.160 --> 38:37.969
<i>Okay.</i>

39:08.120 --> 39:12.728
Well, he's got his daylight ring back.
We're all set for a picnic.

39:15.480 --> 39:17.926
He's lucky he has a brother
who looks out for him.

39:18.160 --> 39:21.130
Otherwise, you might have pawned it
for a pinball machine.

39:25.360 --> 39:27.124
You're suspiciously quiet.

39:32.640 --> 39:36.565
Tell me what Qetsiyah said
back at the cabin.

39:39.200 --> 39:44.240
She told me that we don't stand a chance.

39:45.040 --> 39:47.566
Heh. And what does she know about us?

39:48.400 --> 39:52.200
She told me a very interesting little story
about the history of doppelgangers.

39:52.400 --> 39:54.004
How they're fated to fall in love.

39:54.240 --> 39:59.451
Basically, the universe programmed you to fall
in love with Stefan, not me, which means...

40:01.240 --> 40:04.210
we're a lost cause no matter what we do.

40:04.400 --> 40:06.482
I'm paraphrasing.

40:06.680 --> 40:10.241
- The universe?
- Her words, not mine.

40:11.080 --> 40:12.923
So she's crazy.

40:13.160 --> 40:14.650
Maybe.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.889
Maybe she's not.

40:19.040 --> 40:23.841
Look, I know I spent the last couple days
focusing on trying to find Stefan...

40:24.040 --> 40:27.806
but that has nothing to do
with how I feel about you.

40:29.000 --> 40:33.050
And I'm not gonna let Silas' 2000-year-old
ex-girlfriend screw things up between us.

40:33.280 --> 40:35.282
What, you think I am?

40:36.160 --> 40:39.369
No one tells me how I live my life.
No one tells me who I love.

40:39.560 --> 40:43.690
Especially not some vindictive, prehistoric
witch and definitely not the universe.

40:45.160 --> 40:47.447
I'm not gonna let someone else's idea
of destiny...

40:47.640 --> 40:51.167
stop me from loving you or being with
you or building a future with you...

40:51.360 --> 40:55.684
because you are my life.

41:12.440 --> 41:15.444
- Welcome back, brother.
- Stefan.

41:16.800 --> 41:17.847
We missed you.

41:20.200 --> 41:22.806
Uh, I'm sorry...

41:23.400 --> 41:25.448
I have no idea who you people are.
