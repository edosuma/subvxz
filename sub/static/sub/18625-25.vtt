[music playing]

00:44.920 --> 00:46.505
[Jim] <i>We need help! Please!</i>

00:46.588 --> 00:48.173
-[gasping]
-[horn honking]

00:49.967 --> 00:51.677
[troll] <i>Humans in Trollmarket?</i>

00:51.760 --> 00:53.262
-What's going on?
-Fleshbags.

00:53.345 --> 00:56.223
-What are they doing here?
-They don't trust him.

00:56.306 --> 00:57.641
They don't belong here.

00:57.724 --> 00:59.351
[Barbara panting]

00:59.935 --> 01:01.687
[Barbara] Where are we...?

01:01.770 --> 01:03.772
Just hold on, Mom. You're somewhere safe.

01:03.855 --> 01:05.357
I can't. It's hard to breathe.

01:05.440 --> 01:07.568
We need Vendel! Where's Vendel?

01:07.651 --> 01:09.861
-Jim!
-Great Gronka Morka, what happened?

01:09.945 --> 01:13.407
Angor attacked Strickler.
The binding spell!

01:14.575 --> 01:16.827
-The changeling!
-Let's crush him!

01:16.910 --> 01:18.328
-No!
-Stop!

01:18.412 --> 01:20.664
Not unless you want to kill
his mother too.

01:20.747 --> 01:23.250
Quickly! Bring them both
to the examination dwell.

01:23.750 --> 01:24.668
[yelps]

01:24.751 --> 01:26.253
[screams, groans]

01:30.299 --> 01:31.717
You're going to be okay, Barbara.

01:32.759 --> 01:34.553
Mr. Blinky?

01:35.887 --> 01:37.639
Quickly, this way.

01:37.723 --> 01:39.391
I closed the gate
before Angor Rot got in.

01:39.474 --> 01:41.518
Vendel's going to be able to fix this.
Right, Blink?

01:41.601 --> 01:43.562
Only the Fates can tell now.

01:43.645 --> 01:46.982
Barbara's only hope is to break the spell
that entwines her fate with Strickler's.

01:47.274 --> 01:49.443
If Vendel can, maybe, just maybe,

01:49.526 --> 01:51.778
she'll be strong enough
to survive on her own.

01:51.862 --> 01:54.740
Bring the changeling.
I must treat him as well.

01:54.823 --> 01:55.991
[Barbara moaning]

02:07.085 --> 02:09.211
[gasps] Vendel, how's my mom?

02:09.295 --> 02:13.425
She is resting, for now,
but we must move her to the Heartstone.

02:13.508 --> 02:15.844
Blinky says that we need to break
the binding spell.

02:15.927 --> 02:17.721
I agree with his assessment.

02:17.804 --> 02:21.516
She cannot properly heal
while still bound to the changeling.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.769
Unfortunately, this is Gumm-Gumm magic

02:23.852 --> 02:27.147
and thus, I don't know
the proper incantation.

02:27.230 --> 02:28.482
No, but <i>he </i> does.

02:28.565 --> 02:32.027
Are you waiting for an invitation,
or do I have to beat it out of you?

02:32.110 --> 02:34.613
-I don't have it... with me.
-[Aaarrrgghh!!! growls]

02:34.696 --> 02:37.366
It's in the Book of Ga-huel. In my office.

02:37.449 --> 02:39.409
-We have to go get it.
-We'll have to be careful.

02:39.493 --> 02:43.413
-That crazy psychopath will be there.
-Oh! I forgot about Angor Rot!

02:43.497 --> 02:44.581
No, Coach Lawrence!

02:44.665 --> 02:47.084
It's the Spring Fling Dance
and he's gonna be roaming the halls.

02:47.167 --> 02:50.420
The Spring Fling, it's tonight. I forgot.

02:50.504 --> 02:52.881
Your mom's life is more important
than a stupid dance.

02:52.964 --> 02:57.427
I know, but I was looking forward
to <i>our </i> stupid dance.

02:57.511 --> 02:58.720
Me, too.

02:58.804 --> 03:02.682
Toby and I will get the incantation.
You need to be here for your mom.

03:02.766 --> 03:03.934
You must go now. Make haste!

03:04.017 --> 03:06.520
We got this! Let's go, Toby!

03:07.270 --> 03:08.438
Come on!

03:11.733 --> 03:15.278
-What about the changeling?
-Take him to the stronghold.

03:15.362 --> 03:18.407
-[grunts]
-[bangs]

03:18.490 --> 03:20.367
Haven't I redeemed myself?

03:20.450 --> 03:23.995
The humans have a saying
I would describe as accurate.

03:24.079 --> 03:25.706
"Not even close!"

03:26.832 --> 03:30.669
[boy 1] Did you hear about...
[boy 2] Yo! Wait up!

03:30.752 --> 03:33.713
-Yeah, tonight's gonna be awesome.
-[girl] Selfie.

03:33.797 --> 03:36.133
Did you see what she was wearing?
Oh, my gosh! I can't believe--

03:38.927 --> 03:41.930
Made it. Keep quiet.
Angor Rot's still out there.

03:42.013 --> 03:42.973
Whoa! Agh!

03:43.056 --> 03:44.891
-Shh! Toby!
-Sorry!

03:44.975 --> 03:48.145
Didn't stick the landing. Come on.
Dr. L. doesn't have much time.

03:52.899 --> 03:53.734
[gasps]

03:53.817 --> 03:56.611
All right, back to the dance, you two.

03:56.695 --> 03:58.155
[boh moan]

04:10.208 --> 04:11.418
[stomach gurgles]

04:11.501 --> 04:12.335
[gasps] Wha--?

04:12.419 --> 04:14.504
Hey, come back here, you hooligans!

04:14.588 --> 04:15.672
[Toby whimpering]

04:15.756 --> 04:19.341
-Oh, come on! I see you!
-Quick, get us into Strickler's office!

04:19.426 --> 04:21.011
[Coach] Get back here!

04:22.971 --> 04:23.805
All right!

04:23.889 --> 04:25.265
[stammers]

04:25.766 --> 04:27.100
That's weird.

04:27.184 --> 04:31.104
That was close. Let's make it quick, huh?
I'm not a fan of this room.

04:31.188 --> 04:35.275
Man, Strickler's got a lot
of creepy books in here.

04:35.358 --> 04:39.362
<i>Medieval Torture?</i>
<i>Cryptography and Secret Codes?</i>

04:39.446 --> 04:41.406
-Hey! I think I found it!
-Seriously?

04:41.490 --> 04:44.618
-Here, you speak Troll. Have a look.
-Okay, okay. Let's hurry.

04:44.701 --> 04:45.577
[Toby] Ooh.

04:48.163 --> 04:49.873
Eh...? [gasps]

04:49.956 --> 04:53.502
What's going on in here?
Oh. I know what this is.

04:53.585 --> 04:58.089
You two lovebirds sneaking around
playing "romper room" unsupervised!

04:58.173 --> 05:00.133
-Us? No way.
-Yeah. No.

05:00.217 --> 05:02.093
What is that? Give me!

05:02.177 --> 05:03.512
-No! No! Coach!
-It's not what you think it is!

05:03.595 --> 05:05.138
[sniffs] What is this thing?

05:05.222 --> 05:08.141
This illegal?
A tube, tube-ish kinda...

05:08.225 --> 05:10.936
-All right, that's it. You two, with me!
-[Toby] Oh, boy!

05:11.019 --> 05:12.729
Great. Now what?

05:14.147 --> 05:16.441
Kanjigar warned me about this.

05:16.525 --> 05:18.401
Trollhunters shouldn't have
personal connections.

05:18.485 --> 05:22.072
Yes, and forgive me for disagreeing,
but Kanjigar was wrong.

05:22.155 --> 05:24.115
If there's one thing I've learned
in my time

05:24.199 --> 05:26.409
as a member of your species, Master Jim,

05:26.493 --> 05:30.080
it's that the human bond,
your love for each other

05:30.163 --> 05:31.456
is your greatest strength.

05:31.540 --> 05:34.209
No matter what magic Vendel
is able to work, make no mistake,

05:34.292 --> 05:38.171
it will ultimately be the love you share
with her that will see her through.

05:38.255 --> 05:40.298
You're just saying that
to make me feel better.

05:40.382 --> 05:44.386
Of course, I am.
But I'm also saying it because it's true.

05:44.469 --> 05:47.222
Now, go. Your mother needs you.

05:47.305 --> 05:51.643
[Barbara] So, when you and your friends
said you were going camping...

05:51.726 --> 05:55.522
We were getting a Triumbric stone
from a place called Gatto's Keep.

05:55.605 --> 05:59.442
Right. And when Steve crashed his Vespa?

05:59.526 --> 06:01.611
Um... vulture troll.

06:01.695 --> 06:04.281
And your guidance counselor?

06:04.364 --> 06:08.159
Blinky. He does give me a lot of guidance.

06:08.243 --> 06:11.871
I just can't. It's just-- it's too much.

06:12.998 --> 06:17.002
You really shouldn't be putting yourself
in danger like this. I'm your mother.

06:17.085 --> 06:20.422
I protect <i>you. </i> That's the deal.

06:20.505 --> 06:25.051
I'm fine, Mom.
You don't need to protect me.

06:25.135 --> 06:27.929
I think this is what I was meant to do.

06:28.013 --> 06:30.265
[hums]

06:31.766 --> 06:32.892
Whoa.

06:34.644 --> 06:36.896
I should've told you sooner.

06:36.980 --> 06:39.065
Maybe none of this
would have ever happened.

06:39.149 --> 06:40.609
[sniffles]

06:40.692 --> 06:43.153
You're supposed to be able
to tell me anything.

06:46.197 --> 06:48.199
I never should have lied to you.

06:48.283 --> 06:51.244
-[door opens]
-Jim. A word?

06:54.789 --> 06:56.916
Is everything okay?
Did Claire and Toby get the book?

06:57.000 --> 07:01.087
They have not returned yet.
But I'm afraid we have a new problem.

07:01.171 --> 07:04.549
What do you mean,
you won't undo the binding spell?

07:04.633 --> 07:06.176
I thought you cared about my mother!

07:06.259 --> 07:09.095
I do. Much to my surprise,
and quite deeply.

07:09.179 --> 07:12.474
-In fact, I might even love--
-Do not finish that sentence!

07:12.557 --> 07:16.645
If you really cared about my mother,
you would undo the binding spell.

07:16.728 --> 07:19.522
And then what?
You see my predicament, Young Atlas.

07:19.606 --> 07:21.650
I have my own interests to consider here.

07:21.733 --> 07:22.901
What interests?

07:22.984 --> 07:27.447
The spell has been the only thing
keeping you from harming me, for one.

07:27.530 --> 07:30.325
I won't harm you. I promise.

07:30.408 --> 07:31.618
[growls]

07:31.785 --> 07:33.411
And what of your troll friends?

07:33.495 --> 07:36.915
They have no love for me,
as my present confinement demonstrates.

07:36.998 --> 07:38.833
What's to stop you
from throwing me to the wolves

07:38.917 --> 07:41.378
the second my connection
with your mother is severed?

07:41.461 --> 07:44.881
It's called "honor."
I don't expect <i>you </i> to understand it.

07:44.965 --> 07:48.426
Touché. But you can
understand my reluctance.

07:48.510 --> 07:52.055
Once my mother's okay, you can leave.
No strings attached.

07:52.138 --> 07:55.725
I won't let anybody hurt you.
I give you my word.

07:58.895 --> 08:00.188
[moans]

08:04.150 --> 08:07.487
You've given me much to consider,
Young Atlas.

08:08.279 --> 08:13.618
-What is this thing? Illegal?
-Oh, my! What on Earth is that?

08:13.702 --> 08:15.036
Don't move, knuckleheads,

08:15.120 --> 08:18.581
until we figure out
what you're in trouble for!

08:18.665 --> 08:21.251
We gotta get this spell back
to Jim's mom. Any ideas?

08:21.334 --> 08:22.502
[sighs] Fine.

08:22.585 --> 08:26.089
I have an ace in the hole
I was saving for swim class, but...

08:27.841 --> 08:29.092
[inhales]

08:29.175 --> 08:30.844
[babbles] Blech! Ugh!

08:32.511 --> 08:34.054
[grunts]

08:35.765 --> 08:39.394
Mr. Domzalski!
What in heavens is wrong with you?

08:39.477 --> 08:41.145
[grunting, gasping]

08:41.229 --> 08:43.273
He's going into anamorphic shock!

08:43.356 --> 08:47.527
He's having an attack!
That's his... medical thingy.

08:47.610 --> 08:48.778
Inhaler! He needs it!

08:48.862 --> 08:52.699
-Oh, come on! The kid's clearly faking.
-He looks to be in some distress.

08:52.782 --> 08:55.827
I am! I am! A lot of it!
A lot of distress!

08:55.910 --> 08:57.454
[groans, gasps]

08:58.955 --> 09:01.916
Back up, everyone. I know CPR.

09:02.000 --> 09:06.671
No! No, no, no, no!
No, no!

09:06.755 --> 09:09.007
[gasping]

09:10.091 --> 09:12.385
Ugh! Remind me never to choke.

09:12.469 --> 09:14.554
-What are you waiting for?
-Okay, take it! Take it!

09:14.637 --> 09:18.016
Take your medical thing! Whatever!
Okay! Whatever it is, I don't know!

09:18.099 --> 09:19.976
[Janeth]
You're going to be just fine, Toby.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.353
Always wanted to do CPR.

09:22.437 --> 09:23.855
Ugh!

09:24.397 --> 09:27.317
I should probably take him
to get some air.

09:27.484 --> 09:28.651
Kids today.

09:32.197 --> 09:34.491
[Barbara groans]

09:35.241 --> 09:38.953
It's okay, Mom,
just hold on a little longer.

09:39.037 --> 09:42.749
-Thank you for doing this for me.
-I'm doing it for her.

09:46.252 --> 09:49.422
Come on! Nobody will see us up here!
Let's get the portal open!

09:49.506 --> 09:51.007
[grunts]

09:54.094 --> 09:55.970
Come on, hurry!
Angor Rot could be anywhere by now!

09:56.054 --> 09:57.972
-I'm trying!
-Concentrate!

09:58.056 --> 10:00.225
-What do you think I'm doing?
-Talking to me!

10:07.148 --> 10:08.066
[moans]

10:08.149 --> 10:10.485
Claire! Claire! Claire! Claire!
Claire! Claire! Claire!

10:12.278 --> 10:14.697
Keep saying my name.
It's really helping my concentration.

10:14.781 --> 10:16.658
-No, Claire! He's here!
-[gasps]

10:16.741 --> 10:21.037
The weak human thinks she has the will
to power the Skathe-Hrün.

10:21.121 --> 10:22.163
[Claire yelps]

10:26.251 --> 10:27.293
[yelps]

10:27.377 --> 10:28.211
Ooh!

10:28.294 --> 10:29.379
[panting]

10:30.171 --> 10:32.674
-Oh, no.
-Toby! Get behind me.

10:32.757 --> 10:37.011
Tell me where's the key to Trollmarket,
and I'll let you live!

10:37.095 --> 10:38.763
Toby, run!

10:41.141 --> 10:42.725
Claire, come on! We gotta climb!

10:42.809 --> 10:43.977
[snarls]

10:45.186 --> 10:46.479
[growls]

10:47.897 --> 10:51.943
A staff of such power is not meant
to be wielded by man!

10:56.364 --> 10:58.158
I am not a man.

11:05.582 --> 11:07.333
Now that is power!

11:07.417 --> 11:08.626
-[clanks]
-[grunts]

11:08.710 --> 11:09.878
-[Toby laughs]
-[roars]

11:09.961 --> 11:11.921
Eat brick, hamburger face!

11:13.047 --> 11:16.301
When I've finished with the girl,
I'm coming for you-- ugh!

11:16.384 --> 11:17.802
Rule number three.

11:17.886 --> 11:19.137
[moans]

11:25.768 --> 11:28.479
-Did you see him? Where'd he go?
-Who cares? Let's go!

11:30.523 --> 11:31.691
[Toby screams]

11:31.774 --> 11:34.402
Leaving so soon?

11:34.485 --> 11:35.904
Toby!

11:37.947 --> 11:43.161
You sought to break my enchantment,
but you have failed.

11:43.244 --> 11:46.748
A pity you're not better warriors.

11:46.831 --> 11:49.918
I'm not a warrior,
but I threw javelin in track and field!

11:52.211 --> 11:54.839
-The incantation!
-But where are Toby and Claire?

11:54.923 --> 11:57.258
We must prepare the conjuration at once!

11:57.342 --> 11:58.760
[mutters]

11:58.843 --> 12:01.888
Oh, it seems there is another problem.

12:01.971 --> 12:04.265
What do you mean,
"there's another problem"?

It is my job to worry.
