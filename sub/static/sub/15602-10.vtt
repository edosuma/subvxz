00:22.064 --> 00:24.004
<i>Previously on Green Lantern...</i>

00:24.036 --> 00:26.917
This threat may turn to be
nothing more than a few extremeses.

00:27.083 --> 00:29.017
If the truth does come out,

00:29.085 --> 00:32.588
many will wonder why it isn't
recorded in the book of Oa.

00:32.655 --> 00:36.959
Because, Sayd, history
is written by the victors.

00:46.469 --> 00:49.437
So, you've come to gloat. 

00:49.505 --> 00:50.872
That's not why I'm here.

00:50.940 --> 00:53.708
The power ring chose you over me.

00:53.776 --> 00:57.746
You get to be the all powerful
Green Lantern Queen Iolande.

00:57.813 --> 01:03.251
And I, your poor, ordinary relation,
I get to decay in a cell.

01:03.319 --> 01:05.653
I'd give back the ring if
it could change what happened.

01:05.721 --> 01:07.822
You broke my heart, Ragnar,

01:07.890 --> 01:10.024
the day you killed
Green Lantern Dulak

01:10.092 --> 01:11.793
and raised your sword
against me.

01:11.861 --> 01:14.696
- And now I'm your prisoner.
- But also my brother.

01:14.764 --> 01:17.399
And I thought you'd like
a good meal.

01:18.768 --> 01:20.735
Get out!
Get out of here!

01:20.803 --> 01:23.471
I should be a Green Lantern, not you.

01:23.539 --> 01:27.409
I hate you!
I'll destroy you all!

01:27.476 --> 01:31.679
The Green Lanterns, you,
everyone!

01:35.317 --> 01:38.620
<i>Ragnar of Petrasis,</i>

01:38.687 --> 01:43.458
<i>you have great rage in your heart.</i>

01:50.399 --> 01:53.802
A Green Lantern force is leaving Oa.

01:53.869 --> 01:57.372
Even in light of my concerns,
I persuade the Council.

01:57.440 --> 01:59.974
Don't take it personally, Ganthet.

02:00.042 --> 02:04.078
Like you, Appa acts only
with the best of intentions.

02:04.146 --> 02:06.614
I only hope it was a wise decision.

02:06.682 --> 02:09.918
In their absence, Oa is vulnerable.

02:09.985 --> 02:13.521
Hal Jordan and the other Lanterns
have been alone in the frontier.

02:13.589 --> 02:16.090
Now, in mere months they'll have help.

02:16.158 --> 02:18.393
In a year and a half they'll have help.

02:18.461 --> 02:21.463
I may have a way to help them now.

02:25.835 --> 02:30.605
Green Lantern of sector 2814,
what is the reason for this call?

02:30.673 --> 02:32.540
<i>According to the files Aya downloaded,</i>

02:32.608 --> 02:35.610
<i>there's a massive Red Lantern
fleet headed to guardian space.</i>

02:35.678 --> 02:39.080
<i>Naturally, we're wondering if you and the
rest of your blue man group have a plan.</i>

02:39.148 --> 02:41.950
We're deploying the corps
to defend against the invasion.

02:42.017 --> 02:44.652
What?
You went right into attack mode?

02:44.720 --> 02:47.222
<i>Did you actually read my
report or just skim it?</i>

02:52.795 --> 02:56.731
My point is, the Red Lanterns are
convinced that your army of robot assassins,

02:56.799 --> 03:00.468
the Manhunters, slaughtered their citizens
and annihilated their entire sector.

03:00.536 --> 03:03.338
They think it was a calculated
attempt to wipe them out.

03:03.405 --> 03:06.774
<i>Yes, a dramatic
and emotional story to be sure.</i>

03:06.842 --> 03:10.645
<i>Atrocitus is merely using
propaganda to rally his troops.</i>

03:10.713 --> 03:13.081
But if this whole invasion
is based on lies,

03:13.148 --> 03:15.350
wouldn't that be a reason
to try diplomacy?

03:15.417 --> 03:17.852
If we could convince them
of the truth...

03:17.920 --> 03:19.954
<i>Do not presume
to question us, 2814.</i>

03:20.022 --> 03:22.490
<i>The Guardians are the
greatest minds of the universe</i>

03:22.558 --> 03:25.159
<i>and have come to this decision as one.</i>

03:25.227 --> 03:26.828
Jordan, you've got to hear this.

03:26.896 --> 03:30.532
We have picked up an SOS signal
originating from planet Petrasis.

03:30.599 --> 03:32.600
<i>2814, what's going on?
Explain...</i>

03:32.668 --> 03:35.169
Sorry, got to take this.
We'll finish later.

03:35.237 --> 03:37.805
<i>This is Queen Iolande of Petrasis.</i>

03:37.873 --> 03:39.407
<i>We are under attack by Red Lanterns</i>

03:39.475 --> 03:41.643
<i>and desperately need
immediate assistance.</i>

03:41.710 --> 03:44.412
<i>Please come.</i>

04:05.601 --> 04:07.368
Iolande?

04:08.637 --> 04:10.371
Guess again.

04:10.439 --> 04:13.074
- Ragnar.
- He's a Red.

04:13.142 --> 04:16.678
Like the outfit? I have you
to thank for it after all.

04:19.615 --> 04:21.548
I used to think being
a Green Lantern

04:21.617 --> 04:23.585
would give me everything
I ever wanted.

04:23.652 --> 04:26.321
But I wasn't good enough, was I?

04:26.388 --> 04:28.656
Well, it turns out my
hate for the Green Lanterns

04:28.724 --> 04:33.261
did give me everything
I ever wanted. And more.

04:39.802 --> 04:42.770
I rule Petrasis, as it should be.

04:42.838 --> 04:45.073
Where's Iolande?

04:45.140 --> 04:47.508
Don't worry, she's perfectly fine.

04:47.576 --> 04:51.946
Or should I say perfectly confined?

04:52.014 --> 04:54.382
We're not leaving here
without the Queen.

04:55.450 --> 04:58.319
Kill them!

05:31.520 --> 05:35.123
Correct me if I am wrong,
but is a withdrawal not in order?

05:39.895 --> 05:41.562
We're getting creamed out here.

05:41.630 --> 05:44.499
If we don't pull back now, we're
dead and the mission's over.

05:46.168 --> 05:50.204
- Ok, let's blow this montour stand.
- Hey, that's my line.

06:14.697 --> 06:18.566
The Red Lanterns have blocked
our access to the ship.

06:18.634 --> 06:21.469
That's what we get for
parking in a bad neighborhood.

06:30.813 --> 06:33.014
Let's go.

06:43.792 --> 06:46.461
Hello, Green Lantern.

06:46.528 --> 06:50.798
You've made a fatal decision
returning to Petrasis.

06:55.780 --> 06:57.648
Kothak, after all
that we've been through,

06:57.716 --> 06:59.650
you still want to kill me?

07:06.858 --> 07:10.127
I'm trying to keep us
from being spotted.

07:10.195 --> 07:13.297
Come. Their patrols
are hard enough to avoid

07:13.365 --> 07:16.367
without a Red Lantern
manhunt going on.

07:16.434 --> 07:21.972
Ragnar and his new friends captured
Iolande and took over Petrasis.

07:22.040 --> 07:24.842
I've been leading the resistance since.

07:24.909 --> 07:30.114
But yesterday things went
from bad to unthinkable.

07:30.181 --> 07:33.183
I've heard them call it a Liberator.

07:33.251 --> 07:36.720
- Can you imagine?
- Yes. Yes, I can.

07:36.788 --> 07:39.056
We must do something immediately.

07:39.124 --> 07:41.458
That device will blow
this planet to dust.

07:41.526 --> 07:45.829
So you've dealt with these before.
How did you defeat it?

07:45.897 --> 07:49.199
Uh, that one didn't go so good.

07:49.267 --> 07:54.104
- Then you are less than useless.
- Not quite.

07:54.172 --> 07:58.208
You must disarm the weapon
before it destroys Petrasis.

07:58.276 --> 08:02.646
This is not a sparsely populated colony,
it is a planet of 2 billion.

08:02.714 --> 08:04.782
<i>Maybe there's a way
to diffuse the situation,</i>

08:04.849 --> 08:07.217
<i>show the Red Lanterns
that Atrocitus has been lying</i>

08:07.285 --> 08:09.153
<i>through his weird teeth all along.</i>

08:10.188 --> 08:11.455
What are you speaking of?

08:11.523 --> 08:14.909
<i>The Red Lanterns believe this
crazy story where billions of</i>

08:14.910 --> 08:18.295
<i>years ago you guys sent an army
of killer robots to wipe them out.</i>

08:18.363 --> 08:21.131
<i>Atrocitus told everyone,
so they want revenge.</i>

08:21.199 --> 08:24.201
<i>If we could convince them he's lying,
we could stop this war.</i>

08:24.269 --> 08:29.306
We cannot do that.
Because it did happen.

08:29.374 --> 08:33.910
<i>Wha...
I mean, the robots were real?</i>

08:33.977 --> 08:36.380
<i>And killed all those people?</i>

08:36.448 --> 08:40.751
The Manhunters were created
by the Guardians long ago.

08:40.818 --> 08:45.422
<i>They were the forerunners
of the Green Lantern corps.</i>

08:45.490 --> 08:49.660
<i>For awhile the Manhunters
were the perfect police force.</i>

08:49.728 --> 08:53.897
<i>They were never swayed by emotion,
only right and wrong.</i>

08:53.965 --> 08:57.301
<i>But this is not a universe of absolutes.</i>

08:58.503 --> 09:00.471
<i>Their inability to understand</i>

09:00.538 --> 09:04.108
<i>and interact with emotional beings
ended in tragedy.</i>

09:04.175 --> 09:08.112
<i>The Manhunters destroyed
people, planets, entire sectors,</i>

09:08.179 --> 09:12.449
forming what we now call
the forgotten zone.

09:12.517 --> 09:16.019
The Manhunters are
our greatest shame,

09:16.087 --> 09:18.388
the Guardians' darkest secret.

09:18.456 --> 09:21.692
It's time for the source
of collected guardian guilt

09:21.760 --> 09:23.827
to face the light of day.

09:23.895 --> 09:26.430
You focus on disarming
the Liberator.

09:26.498 --> 09:31.168
I may be able to assist you,
but I must first speak with Appa.

09:31.236 --> 09:34.037
<i>We're counting on you, Ganthet.</i>

09:34.105 --> 09:37.941
Hey, Red, any chance
you and I can get our ship back?

09:38.009 --> 09:41.078
I believe we can handle
that little errand.

09:43.581 --> 09:47.117
Kothak, we have a Queen
to rescue and a bomb to disarm.

09:47.185 --> 09:50.554
The fact is we will never be
able to end this Red Lantern threat

09:50.622 --> 09:53.857
without admitting to our own
tragic part in their history.

09:53.925 --> 09:57.861
You indulge in guilt, Ganthet.
It clouds your better judgment.

09:57.929 --> 10:02.533
The Council, you with us,
decided silence was best.

10:02.600 --> 10:05.235
The corps only need know
what we tell them.

10:05.303 --> 10:08.672
We must not allow Petrasis
to pay the price for our sins.

10:08.740 --> 10:10.908
The loss of a planet,
however unfortunate,

10:10.975 --> 10:13.143
is inconsequential
against maintaining

10:13.211 --> 10:15.412
peace and order
on a million others.

10:15.480 --> 10:18.182
I disagree strongly
with your moral calculus.

10:18.249 --> 10:20.684
And there is still hope for Petrasis.

10:20.752 --> 10:23.153
Before Hal Jordan
borrowed the interceptor...

10:23.221 --> 10:24.555
Stole, you mean.

10:24.622 --> 10:31.662
- Ahh. At your urging.
- I put something aboard,

10:31.729 --> 10:34.898
something that could boost
their power exponentially

10:34.966 --> 10:36.767
should the need arise.

10:36.835 --> 10:39.269
Not your prototype.

10:39.337 --> 10:42.573
Ganthet, an experimental device
based on a theory

10:42.640 --> 10:46.310
about hope and will
is emotional madness.

10:46.377 --> 10:48.879
And to do this without
the Council's knowledge?

10:48.947 --> 10:52.916
Hal Jordan needs our help.
We must act now.

10:52.984 --> 10:58.322
Perhaps you are right, Ganthet.
It is time for the truth to come out.

11:23.815 --> 11:27.451
- Hal.
- Come on, there's not much time.

11:27.518 --> 11:29.319
Guardians of Oa,

11:29.387 --> 11:33.390
you have been called here
to discuss a grave matter.

11:33.458 --> 11:36.793
There has been an unforgivable
breach of trust

11:36.861 --> 11:38.962
that must be brought to light.

11:39.030 --> 11:43.267
What he says is true enough.
There is a traitor among us.

11:43.334 --> 11:47.437
And his name is Ganthet.

11:47.505 --> 11:48.939
Consider what you are doing.

11:49.007 --> 11:52.543
Silence. According to Guardian
law, the accused will not

11:52.544 --> 11:56.079
speak before the charges are
brought before the Council.

11:56.147 --> 11:59.666
By his own admission, Ganthet
aided and allowed Hal Jordan

11:59.667 --> 12:03.186
to take the interceptor
without Council approval.

12:03.254 --> 12:08.358
But worst of all is Ganthet's
blatant use of an unreliable emotion.

12:08.426 --> 12:12.596
It is true.
I believe willpower is not enough.

12:12.664 --> 12:15.999
We need hope.
We all need hope.

12:16.067 --> 12:21.605
Embracing a base emotion is a violation
of the trues that we hold sacred.

12:21.673 --> 12:24.641
And for that, you are banished.

12:38.022 --> 12:40.857
I'm sorry for getting
you all into this mess.

12:40.925 --> 12:44.628
Oh, don't apologize.
We love this kind of stuff.

12:50.935 --> 12:54.171
What are you doing here?
The Liberator is under attack.

12:54.238 --> 12:57.774
They think me weak?
Kill Iolande.

12:57.842 --> 13:01.611
Dunce! Your sister is one of the
Green Lanterns attacking the device.

13:03.214 --> 13:06.683
Send everyone!
I will lead the counterattack.

13:12.357 --> 13:15.392
<i>All units report
to the Liberator at once.</i>

13:20.865 --> 13:23.567
Your treachery threatens
everything we believe in.

13:23.634 --> 13:27.504
I am not the threat here,
Ganthet. You are.

13:27.572 --> 13:28.872
The citizens of guardian space

13:28.940 --> 13:31.508
put their trust in us,
come to us for guidance.

13:31.576 --> 13:34.678
What would happen if they learned
the truth about the forgotten zone?

13:34.746 --> 13:37.531
All order would be lost.
There would be chaos and suffering

13:37.532 --> 13:40.317
beyond anything the Manhunters had done.

13:40.385 --> 13:43.353
You maintain a lie.

13:43.421 --> 13:47.141
Ganthet, you are hereby
banished, sentenced to live out

13:47.142 --> 13:50.861
the rest of your days cut off
from your species and civilization.

13:50.928 --> 13:54.498
I almost feel the base emotion
pity for you.

13:54.565 --> 14:00.404
Only almost, though, Appa?
And there's the pity.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.135
Hold on. I've still got
an ace up my sleeve.

14:32.203 --> 14:33.804
<i>Guardians of Oa,</i>

14:33.871 --> 14:37.107
<i>this is Green Lantern of sector 2814
calling for Ganthet.</i>

14:37.175 --> 14:38.708
<i>I need immediate assistance.</i>

14:38.776 --> 14:41.645
I'm afraid Ganthet
is no longer with the Council.

14:41.712 --> 14:43.146
<i>Where is he?</i>

14:43.214 --> 14:48.752
My apologies, 2814, but as you
say, I must got to take this.

14:50.054 --> 14:54.858
- What did they say?
- We're on our own.

15:07.059 --> 15:08.859
They're closing in!

15:38.624 --> 15:41.993
- Excellent aim.
- Thank you.

15:47.933 --> 15:50.067
The cavalery has arrived.

16:33.945 --> 16:36.647
- Sayd.
- Ganthet, I've come to trust you.

16:36.715 --> 16:39.717
I reprogrammed the ship's destination.

16:41.553 --> 16:44.288
You could be banished
for what you've done.

16:44.356 --> 16:49.360
If there's a chance we can
help Hal Jordan, we must try.

16:52.497 --> 16:55.066
It's sealed.

16:58.036 --> 17:01.038
Get that door open.

17:21.660 --> 17:25.229
<i>Warning.
Lantern engine overheating.</i>

18:07.973 --> 18:12.443
- Will it work, Ganthet?
- I don't know, Sayd.

18:12.511 --> 18:15.379
But we must have hope.

18:16.615 --> 18:21.786
You've lost, dear sister.
I am the ruler of Petrasis.

18:21.853 --> 18:27.491
Do you understand me?
Ragnar of the Red Lanterns!

19:25.517 --> 19:28.986
That's never happened before.

19:33.391 --> 19:36.494
It's... it's a miracle.

19:36.561 --> 19:39.530
See, the gods are with us!

19:42.901 --> 19:46.170
Do you guys see this?
Hoo hoo! Yeah!

19:46.238 --> 19:48.706
It's like I'm super charged
or something.

19:51.576 --> 19:55.880
- Why is it doing that?
- It's about to blow.

19:55.947 --> 19:58.949
If we can't disarm it,
we'll get rid of it.

20:03.955 --> 20:06.857
You've got to be kidding.
How are we supposed to lift this?

20:16.601 --> 20:19.570
I can get used to this.

20:46.064 --> 20:49.667
You don't think that whole blue
light show was Ganthet, do you?

20:49.734 --> 20:53.938
I don't know what just happened.
But I'm glad it did.

20:55.540 --> 20:58.409
<i>Thank you for all you've done, Sayd.</i>

20:58.476 --> 21:02.413
But still, I must leave Oa.

21:02.480 --> 21:05.883
I wonder if what we did today helped.

21:05.951 --> 21:09.453
It did.
I can feel it.

21:09.521 --> 21:14.992
- Telepathy, Ganthet?
- No. Hope.
