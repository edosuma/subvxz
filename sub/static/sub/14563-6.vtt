WEBVTT

00:09.009 --> 00:10.427
...fucker!

00:12.721 --> 00:18.101
-So, we have some options.
-Yeah, a lot of options to discuss.

00:18.185 --> 00:20.562
-You know I love you.
-That's not what this is about.

00:20.646 --> 00:23.232
We always agreed
we didn't want kids, unless--

00:23.315 --> 00:25.108
A streetwise but soulful teen
needed somewhere to live

00:25.192 --> 00:26.610
as he waited
for his Juilliard audition.

00:26.693 --> 00:29.488
We'd support his dancing and let him
stay in the guest room, right.

00:29.571 --> 00:32.157
-But a baby? Are you--?
-It's not about me.

00:32.241 --> 00:34.868
There's no "I" in uterus,
there's only "us."

00:34.952 --> 00:37.246
And "U," and another "U,"

00:37.329 --> 00:40.457
but that's the "U" that's in "us,"
so I already said that "U."

00:40.541 --> 00:43.752
The point is,
I'm going to be here for you, 24/7.

00:43.835 --> 00:47.965
Two hundred and forty-seven percent,
that's how "there for you" I'll be.

00:48.048 --> 00:50.842
-Whatever you decide...
-What we decide, because this is--

00:50.926 --> 00:54.012
Definitely. This is a conversation.

00:55.138 --> 00:58.475
Let's both say what we want
at the same time on three.

00:58.559 --> 01:00.978
-Okay.
-One, two--

01:01.061 --> 01:02.354
On three or after three?

01:02.437 --> 01:05.357
How could I say it "on three"?
I'll be saying "three."

01:05.440 --> 01:08.485
-Okay. Okay.
-One, two, three...

01:08.569 --> 01:09.778
-Abortion.
-Get an abortion.

01:09.861 --> 01:12.364
Oh, no. We said different things.

nine out of the last ten years.

Nine out of ten?

03:06.645 --> 03:09.231
If you were an airline
and landed nine out of ten planes,

03:09.314 --> 03:11.525
you wouldn't exactly brag about that
in your commercial.

03:11.608 --> 03:14.486
Everyone loves <i>Secretariat</i>.
Your time will come.

03:14.569 --> 03:19.282

Hey, yo, Scott!

03:21.743 --> 03:23.036
Hey, Diane.

03:23.120 --> 03:26.373
-Diane, Diane, Diane.
-I'm doing my job, BoJack.

03:26.456 --> 03:27.624
Young people and their phones.

03:27.707 --> 03:30.210
There could be a beautiful rainbow
in this room right now

03:30.293 --> 03:31.503
and you would have no idea.

03:31.586 --> 03:32.838
Really makes you think, huh?

03:32.921 --> 03:34.631
Can you look at rainbows on your phone?

03:34.714 --> 03:36.341
Shut up, BoJack.

03:36.425 --> 03:37.551
Shit.

03:37.634 --> 03:40.095
I just tweeted "Shut up, BoJack,"
as Cynthia Nixon.

03:40.178 --> 03:42.347
I'd buy it. She is not a fan,
and for good reason.

03:42.431 --> 03:45.392
-We were up in the Poconos, she and I...
-BoJack, not now.

03:45.475 --> 03:47.686
-What's up your butt tonight?
-You really wanna know?

03:47.769 --> 03:50.188
I would seriously like to know
what crawled up your butt,

03:50.272 --> 03:52.107
made a home for itself in your butt,

03:52.190 --> 03:55.193
started a family, lived a fruitful life,
and then died up your butt.

03:55.277 --> 03:56.570
I'm getting an abortion.

03:56.653 --> 03:58.530
Whoa, that takes me back.

03:58.613 --> 04:00.991
I had more than my share of abortions
in the '90s.

04:01.074 --> 04:02.784
I didn't get them, I paid for them.

04:02.868 --> 04:05.162
I really hope all those women
actually got the abortions,

04:05.245 --> 04:07.330
and didn't just keep my money.

04:07.414 --> 04:10.917
Diane, are you tweeting for pop starlet
Sextina Aquafina right now?

04:11.001 --> 04:12.252
I'm trying to. Why?

04:12.335 --> 04:15.797
Because her account
just tweeted out to 40 million followers,

04:15.881 --> 04:17.340
"I'm getting an abortion."

04:17.424 --> 04:18.258
What? No--

04:18.341 --> 04:19.551
She--

04:19.634 --> 04:20.552
Oh, balls.

04:22.053 --> 04:23.680
The tweet heard round the world.

04:23.764 --> 04:26.892
Sextina Aquafina says,
"I'm getting an abortion."

04:26.975 --> 04:30.103
And the world says, "Whaaa?"

04:30.187 --> 04:31.980
If it's happening,
we're gonna talk about it.

04:32.063 --> 04:33.940
It's time for Tom's Rant.

04:34.941 --> 04:36.943
Is Twitter an appropriate forum

04:37.027 --> 04:39.321
to be discussing a sensitive issue
like abortion?

04:39.404 --> 04:42.157
Wouldn't a better forum be nowhere?

04:42.240 --> 04:46.495
Wait, does that say "Tom Srant"?
Why does that say Tom Srant?

04:46.578 --> 04:47.579
I clearly said--

04:47.662 --> 04:50.248
Randy, don't look at Jessica.
This is on you.

04:52.918 --> 04:56.546
Diane, VIM is hanging on by a thread
and only barely scraping by

04:56.630 --> 04:58.173
because of clients like Sextina.

04:58.256 --> 05:01.468
Hey! Heard you pulled the trigger
on the Big Bear condo.

05:01.551 --> 05:04.429
Great investment.
We are not on the edge of complete ruin.

05:04.513 --> 05:06.723
We are on the edge of complete ruin.

05:06.807 --> 05:09.935
I think if I explain it to her
and apologize, she'll understand.

05:10.018 --> 05:13.438
Because she's so understanding?
This is a teenage pop star.

05:13.522 --> 05:15.649
Literally the two least
compassionate entities

05:15.732 --> 05:18.109
combined into the supernova
of not understanding

05:18.193 --> 05:20.737
that is Sextina Aquafina.

05:22.364 --> 05:24.699
Ugh. So imagine my surprise

05:24.783 --> 05:28.620
when I'm in the middle of a performance
for Gaddafi's cousin on his yacht

05:28.703 --> 05:32.791
and I'm in a giant champagne flute
singing "Left Titty"

05:32.874 --> 05:35.585
and everyone starts to look
at their phones and look at me,

05:35.669 --> 05:39.047
because I am apparently aborting a baby
I do not have.

05:39.130 --> 05:44.177
So I had them turn their boat into a car
and drive me here to fire someone.

05:44.261 --> 05:47.305
-I think that's me.
-Great. You're fired, Glasses.

05:47.389 --> 05:48.682
<i>♪ Sextina! ♪</i>

05:48.765 --> 05:52.978

05:53.061 --> 05:54.104
Oh. Oh!

05:54.187 --> 05:55.939
What "oh?" Who said you could "Oh?"

05:56.022 --> 05:59.776
Taylor Swift just tweeted
that you were "brave."

05:59.859 --> 06:02.654
Nicki Minaj tweeted at you
a face with heart eyes.

06:02.737 --> 06:05.657
And BuzzFeed just posted a list
of top 15 celebrities

06:05.740 --> 06:07.617
who should have had abortions
like Sextina.

06:07.701 --> 06:11.162
-You're trending like crazy.
-I'm trending?

06:11.246 --> 06:13.582
Most women who go through this
never talk about it

06:13.665 --> 06:14.916
because it's so stigmatized.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.586
The fact that you're coming out like this
is huge.

06:17.669 --> 06:19.796
It would be, if you were
actually getting an abortion.

06:19.879 --> 06:24.259
So what you're saying is,
maybe I <i>am </i>getting an abortion?

06:24.342 --> 06:26.636
Well, no, because you're not.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.681
Yeah, but if you did,
this would make you a cultural icon.

06:29.764 --> 06:33.310
Glasses, you're un-fired.
I'm getting an abortion.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.020
-Well...
-I gotta go on talk shows.

06:35.103 --> 06:38.273
If I can make one woman
feel a little less alone,

06:38.356 --> 06:39.941
then it's all worth it, right?

06:40.025 --> 06:41.067
Yeah...

06:41.151 --> 06:44.029
And if I can make a million women
buy my album,

06:44.112 --> 06:45.739
then it's definitely all worth it.

06:45.822 --> 06:46.656
Um...

06:46.740 --> 06:48.658
-Diane, take the yes.
-Okay.

06:48.742 --> 06:53.038
Sextina Aquafina, you are now the face
of the pro-choice movement.

06:53.121 --> 06:56.541
-Now let's get you informed.
-Hey! Uh, what?

06:59.836 --> 07:01.212
So, before the procedure,

07:01.296 --> 07:04.007
you'll need to look at an ultrasound
and listen to the heartbeat.

07:04.090 --> 07:05.925
Or heartbeats, if you're having a litter.

07:06.009 --> 07:07.677
Why does she have to listen
to the heartbeat?

07:07.761 --> 07:11.181
It's the law. Also, by law,
I have to tell you that at one month,

07:11.264 --> 07:14.559
your puppies have a favorite color
and that color may be blue.

07:14.643 --> 07:17.562
-That can't be true.
-By law, I have to tell you that.

07:17.646 --> 07:18.813
Also, before your procedure,

07:18.897 --> 07:21.316
you'll need to watch
20 hours of cute puppy videos

07:21.399 --> 07:24.319
as Sarah McLachlan's
"I Will Remember You" plays softly.

07:24.402 --> 07:27.322
Don't worry, Diane, I will watch
the cute puppy videos for you.

07:27.405 --> 07:30.617
-It's a sacrifice I'm willing to make.
-No, she has to watch the videos.

07:30.700 --> 07:34.454
Don't worry, Diane, we will watch
the cute puppy videos together.

07:34.537 --> 07:38.458
-No, she has to watch them alone.
-Diane, I have some terrible news.

07:41.586 --> 07:45.840
Tomorrow, our exclusive interview
with the irrepressible provocateuse

07:45.924 --> 07:47.759
Sextina Aquafina.

07:47.842 --> 07:52.222
But first, one thing that isn't
being aborted: the road to Oscar.

07:52.305 --> 07:54.349
Tonight, the Leonard Maltin Awards.

07:54.432 --> 07:56.685
Handing out trophies
to all the performances this year

07:56.768 --> 07:59.104
that Leonard Maltin thought
were pretty good.

08:00.689 --> 08:04.901
And the Malty for Pretty Good Actor
goes to Bread Poot.

08:04.985 --> 08:07.237
Whoo!

08:15.745 --> 08:16.913
You need another drink?

08:16.997 --> 08:20.417
Why? Because I lost, I'm a loser,
so I have to drown my sorrows in scotch?

08:20.500 --> 08:23.086
No, I just meant because of thirst.

08:23.169 --> 08:24.295
I could use a scotch.

08:24.379 --> 08:27.007
Oh, look. Jurj Clooners.

08:27.090 --> 08:28.800
There he is, Jurj Clooners.

08:28.883 --> 08:30.635
Hey, how are you? Thank you.

08:30.719 --> 08:32.762
Jurj sucks.
What does everyone love about him?

08:32.846 --> 08:35.974
He's not a god.
He's just an old guy who loves pranks.

08:36.057 --> 08:37.726
Sure sounds like God.

08:37.809 --> 08:40.395
-Jurj, hey, man.
-BoJack, right?

08:40.478 --> 08:42.480
Yeah, good to see you.

08:42.564 --> 08:47.277
Hey, Jurj, my name's Todd,
and my friend Keith sleeps on your couch.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.821
Oh, you know Keith?
Tell him to clean up his shit.

08:49.904 --> 08:51.656
Oh.

08:51.740 --> 08:53.241
That is so Keith.

08:53.324 --> 08:56.703
Todd, why don't you do the grown-ups
a favor and go find your own shadow?

08:56.786 --> 08:59.122
It was here a second ago.

08:59.205 --> 09:02.333
Jurj, I loved you
in <i>The Nazi Who Played Yahtzee.</i>

09:02.417 --> 09:04.794
How do you get in the head
of a war criminal?

09:04.878 --> 09:07.422
You know,
I don't think of him as a war criminal.

09:07.505 --> 09:10.467
I just think of him as a person
who had a funny accent.

09:10.550 --> 09:13.094
Totally. I think I'm getting
the hang of all this now.

09:13.178 --> 09:17.724
You won last night, the other guy
won tonight, maybe I'll win next time.

09:17.807 --> 09:21.269
Yikes.
Look, man, you're not gonna be next.

09:21.352 --> 09:24.022
This will sound dumb
coming out of my mouth, but it's true.

09:24.105 --> 09:29.027
So Jurj, Bread, Mitt, those are names.
Like real names.

09:29.110 --> 09:31.654
Lernernerner DiCarpricorn, that's a name.

09:31.738 --> 09:33.698
-BoJack, not a name.
-Huh.

09:33.782 --> 09:36.076
I figured they would, like,
tell you this stuff.

09:36.159 --> 09:38.495
You're the Fifth Man. You get it, right?

09:38.578 --> 09:40.789
-Well--
-Yeah, you get it. Put her there.

09:40.872 --> 09:41.873
Oh!

09:41.956 --> 09:45.085
Joy buzzer. You just got Jurjed!

09:45.168 --> 09:46.961
All right, I'll see you later.

09:47.045 --> 09:51.841
Vivica.
Now I know why they call you A. Fox.

09:52.884 --> 09:54.552
Excuse me, you gonna stay here long?

09:54.636 --> 09:57.138
We got the OCD Image Awards tomorrow,

09:57.222 --> 10:00.433
and those guys really like
a clean afterparty.

10:04.521 --> 10:06.606
So, let me get this straight, Sextina.

10:06.689 --> 10:09.067
Someone put a baby in your belly
and now you're like,

10:09.150 --> 10:11.528
"Awooga!
Is there an undo button around here?

10:11.611 --> 10:13.071
Leggo my preggo."

10:13.154 --> 10:16.116
-Is that right?
-That is exactly correct, A Ryan,

10:16.199 --> 10:20.578
but I am very excited for this opportunity
to put a face on this important issue.

10:20.662 --> 10:23.790
One out of three women
will have an abortion in her life.

10:23.873 --> 10:26.501
That sounds crazy high to me,
I don't buy it.

10:26.584 --> 10:29.921
I wanted to destigmatize the experience
for all women out there,

10:30.004 --> 10:32.173
so I'm dropping a new single.

10:32.257 --> 10:33.716

10:33.800 --> 10:35.802

You empowered me to tell my story.

11:04.414 --> 11:08.960
I think the tone might be a little severe?

11:09.544 --> 11:12.881
Look, when you get an abortion,
you can express yourself however you want,

11:12.964 --> 11:15.508
but this is about my body and my choices,

11:15.592 --> 11:19.596
and my choice
is to be a totally insane badass.

11:19.679 --> 11:22.599
Ugh! I <i>am </i>getting an abortion.
You're not even really pregnant.

11:22.682 --> 11:26.477
So? This is show business.
"Brrap brrap. Pew pew."

11:28.396 --> 11:30.690
"Brrap brrap. Pew pew."

11:30.773 --> 11:34.319
A daring battle cry from
the self-appointed New Voice of Choice.

11:34.402 --> 11:37.906
But has the concept of women
having choices gone too far?

11:37.989 --> 11:40.783
We've assembled this diverse panel
of white men in bow ties

11:40.867 --> 11:42.660
to talk about abortion. Gentlemen?

11:42.744 --> 11:45.246
Tom, this is not just a woman's issue.

11:45.330 --> 11:47.415
I'm a man, but if I got pregnant,

11:47.498 --> 11:51.461
would I put my life on hold
for a child I didn't want? Yes, I would.

11:51.544 --> 11:52.837
I can say that with confidence,

11:52.921 --> 11:56.007
because I will never have to make
that decision, so I'm unbiased.

11:56.090 --> 11:59.677
-Does this video glamorize abortion?
-Very possibly, Tom.

11:59.761 --> 12:02.972
Millennials today think everything is NBD.

12:03.056 --> 12:07.101
NBD of course stands for No BD,
referring to B.D. Wong,

12:07.185 --> 12:09.437
who teens think is a very big deal.

12:09.520 --> 12:14.233
So if something's not BD,
it means it's not a big deal.

12:14.317 --> 12:19.447
-These days, abortions are not BD.
-Are abortions even necessary?

12:19.530 --> 12:23.034
I heard a theory that if a woman
really has an unwanted pregnancy,

12:23.117 --> 12:26.120
the body has a way to break the fetus down
into gas particles

12:26.204 --> 12:28.122
and then she can just fart it out.

12:28.206 --> 12:31.459
Where did you hear this intriguing
"fart it out" theory?

12:31.542 --> 12:35.296
-I don't remember. Maybe the Bible?
-Thank you for clarifying.

12:35.380 --> 12:38.549
Next up, Jurj Clooners
is making audiences cry

12:38.633 --> 12:42.512
in his new film, but his latest prank
might make you... think?

12:42.971 --> 12:45.264
Jurj. He likes pranks, huh?

12:45.348 --> 12:47.934
I'll prank him. I'll prank him real good.

12:48.017 --> 12:50.436
We'll need to draw him out.
What do A-list actors like?

12:50.520 --> 12:52.563
Stretch limos? Nannies?

12:52.647 --> 12:56.859
Flying their private jets
to disaster areas so they can "help out"?

12:56.943 --> 12:58.403
Yeah, limos. We'll get a limo.

12:58.486 --> 13:00.655
I'll need one of those caps,
I'll be the driver.

13:00.738 --> 13:03.282
I'll pick him up,
and he'll be all like, "I'm Jurj, I suck,"

13:03.366 --> 13:06.160
and then I'll be all, "Surprise,"
and hit him with a bat.

13:06.244 --> 13:07.328
Pranked!

13:07.412 --> 13:11.624
It really doesn't seem like a prank
as much as you hitting him with a bat.

13:11.708 --> 13:15.336
Yeah, it's a bad prank on purpose
to show how stupid pranks are.

13:15.420 --> 13:17.672
-That's the point.
-Is that the point?

13:17.755 --> 13:20.508
I'm working on levels here, man.
To the limousine repository.

13:23.428 --> 13:25.930
Good afternoon, Mr. Clooners.

13:26.014 --> 13:28.808
Hey, man, just one sec,
my publicist is right behind me.

13:28.891 --> 13:31.477
Of course. Bring the publicist.

13:33.396 --> 13:34.856
-Oh, shit.
-What's that, driver?

13:34.939 --> 13:39.068
I said, "Auschwitz."
You're the Nazi who played Yahtzee.

13:39.152 --> 13:43.031
Right, well, anyway, we're going
to the AOL-Time-Warner-PepsiCo-Viacom

13:43.114 --> 13:46.075
Halliburton-Skynet-Toyota-Trader Joe's
Auditorium

13:46.159 --> 13:47.910
for the Image Choice Spirit Awards.

13:47.994 --> 13:52.790
Uh... okay, yes, ma'am.
Here I go. Driving, driving.

13:52.874 --> 13:55.293
You don't need to talk,
you can just drive.

13:55.376 --> 13:57.170
Actually, can we make a couple stops?

13:57.253 --> 14:00.840
I am totally out of toilet paper,
so if you could find a Rite Aid.

14:00.923 --> 14:05.928
You have to go in and buy the TP for me.
I'll get mobbed by fans if I go in.

14:06.012 --> 14:08.264
Just pick out something
extra soft for my tushy.

14:09.057 --> 14:10.892
-I don't know
-Do as he says, driver.

14:10.975 --> 14:13.644
-Chop chop.
-Okay.

14:16.272 --> 14:19.442
My concern is that you're
actually giving the pro-life movement

14:19.525 --> 14:21.486
something to latch onto
as an example of--

14:21.569 --> 14:23.905
Oh, my God, you are so boring.

14:23.988 --> 14:26.491
Can I abort talking to you right now?
Abort.

14:26.574 --> 14:29.827
-You need to stop and think--
-Or what? You gonna sic Fido on me?

14:29.911 --> 14:32.497
I am just here for emotional support.

14:32.580 --> 14:35.416
Can you let it go?
I don't want to have to ask you again.

14:35.500 --> 14:37.835
I really think we have the chance
to say something here,

14:37.919 --> 14:41.339
and all we're saying
is "Pshew pshew pow."

14:41.422 --> 14:42.840
-What is that?
-What are you doing?

14:42.924 --> 14:44.509
That's the gun sounds, from the song.

14:44.592 --> 14:47.095
Uh. Do you mean, "Brrap brrap pew pew"?

14:47.178 --> 14:49.639
Yeah, that's what I did. "Pshow, kapow."

14:49.722 --> 14:51.682
-That's not what a gun sounds like.
-Prrow!

14:51.766 --> 14:53.434
-Pshow, kapow!
-Bop!

14:53.518 --> 14:55.228
-Brrap brrap pew pew!
-Ppew, ping!

14:55.311 --> 14:57.563
Can everyone please
stop making gun sounds?

14:57.647 --> 14:59.232
It is really freaking me out.

14:59.315 --> 15:01.734
My point is,
everyone's listening to you now.

15:01.818 --> 15:04.570
Soon people are gonna get bored
and move onto the next thing

15:04.654 --> 15:07.115
and you'll hate yourself
that you weren't able to make a difference

15:07.198 --> 15:08.408
when you had the chance.

15:08.491 --> 15:10.868
Believe me,
it happens sooner than you think.

15:10.952 --> 15:12.412
Oh...

15:13.037 --> 15:15.164
Hi. I'm A Ryan Sea--

15:16.874 --> 15:19.460
Okay, we're here, finally. Get out.

15:19.544 --> 15:21.421
Ooh, can we make one more stop?

15:21.504 --> 15:24.090
I just remembered
we left my wife back at the house.

15:24.173 --> 15:26.050
Can we go back? Pwease?

15:26.134 --> 15:28.302
Driver? The man said, "Pwease."

15:28.386 --> 15:32.807
That's it. Enough.
I am not your driver. It is I, BoJack.

15:33.558 --> 15:35.601
BoJack? What are you doing?

15:35.685 --> 15:38.396
I was gonna prank Jurj
by hitting him with this bat,

15:38.479 --> 15:42.024
but you got into the car because,
apparently, you are a two-timing liar.

15:42.108 --> 15:43.734
What's the thing with the bat?

15:43.818 --> 15:46.028
BoJack, this is not a good look on you.

15:46.112 --> 15:48.030
All this time,
I thought you believed in me.

15:48.114 --> 15:50.741
This is why your clients win every year.
You represent everyone.

15:50.825 --> 15:53.369
It has nothing to do with whether
you're a good publicist or not.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.371
I am a marvelous publicist.

15:55.455 --> 15:58.541
Not to me. You're doing great work
for this asshole who loves pranks.

15:58.624 --> 15:59.876
You're pranking him right now.

15:59.959 --> 16:03.045
Yeah, with a bad prank
to show how stupid pranks are.

16:03.129 --> 16:05.006
Seems a little convoluted,

16:05.089 --> 16:07.633
which is actually a trademark
of a great prank.

16:07.717 --> 16:09.051
Well played, sir.

16:09.135 --> 16:12.013
No, it's a bad prank.
That's my point. Pranks are dumb.

16:12.096 --> 16:15.391
We're late, and I won't keep going
round and round with you on this.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.185
Publicists have many clients.

16:17.268 --> 16:18.978
Not my publicist. You're fired.

16:19.061 --> 16:21.522
Are you kidding?
Who fires Ana Spanakopita?

16:21.606 --> 16:22.690
I do. I just did.

16:22.773 --> 16:25.651
Who's gonna set up
your press appearances?

16:25.735 --> 16:28.029
Your hopeless agent? Your idiot sidekick?

16:28.112 --> 16:30.323
Not your problem.
Get the hell out of my limo.

16:30.406 --> 16:33.493
'Cause I gotta pick up
a bachelorette party in 30 minutes.

16:34.494 --> 16:38.748
Sextina, welcome to the program.
Can I get a "pew pew" for the fans?

16:38.831 --> 16:43.169
-Tom, abortion is a very serious subject.
-Yes, very serious, I agree.

16:43.252 --> 16:45.463
I want to tell the real story
about abortion,

16:45.546 --> 16:47.298
show America what it's really about,

16:47.381 --> 16:50.343
which is why your girl Sextina Aquafina

16:50.426 --> 16:53.971
is gonna have her abortion
live on television.

16:54.055 --> 16:55.097
What what?

16:55.181 --> 16:57.683
Pay-per-view, chitches.

16:57.767 --> 16:58.893
-What?
-What?

16:58.976 --> 17:02.480
"Pay-per-view, chitches."
Brrap brrap, pew pew, ka-ching ka-ching.

17:02.563 --> 17:05.233
How are you going to have
an abortion on live TV

17:05.316 --> 17:06.943
when you're not even
really having an abortion?

17:07.026 --> 17:09.737
-Duh, we'll just <i>Argo </i>that shit.
-What does that mean?

17:09.820 --> 17:13.533
Yeah, yeah. Fake abortion.
Movie magic, like in <i>Argo.</i>

17:13.616 --> 17:15.409
That is not what happened in <i>Argo.</i>

17:15.493 --> 17:18.079
If we're gonna do this,
we got to be real tasteful.

17:18.162 --> 17:21.791
Yeah, only the best for my abortion.
All class.

17:21.874 --> 17:23.709
John Carpenter
can do the practical effects.

17:23.793 --> 17:25.419
-He owes me a favor.
-What?

17:25.503 --> 17:27.797
We'll book Eddie Redmayne as the fetus.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.173
Are you hearing yourselves?

17:29.257 --> 17:32.635
We're not going to fake an abortion
on live TV.

17:32.718 --> 17:34.220
Obviously, we'll pre-tape it.

17:34.303 --> 17:37.306
Then put a little box in the corner
of the screen that says "Live."

17:37.390 --> 17:39.976
You don't think
this is incredibly disrespectful

17:40.059 --> 17:42.144
to the women who actually get abortions?

17:42.228 --> 17:43.729
Not if we do it tasteful.

17:43.813 --> 17:47.066
Diane, this is what the client wants.
Stop making it about you.

17:47.149 --> 17:48.693
I'm not making it about me.

17:48.776 --> 17:51.904
-I am so tired of you creating problems.
-I'm not--

17:51.988 --> 17:53.739
I'm sorry you're so fertile

17:53.823 --> 17:56.409
and in a sexually active,
loving relationship

17:56.492 --> 17:58.119
and now you don't want a family.

17:58.202 --> 18:00.955
-I'm sure that's really hard for you.
-What?

18:01.038 --> 18:04.917
Uh... if this is not about me anymore,
then I'mma go.

18:05.001 --> 18:07.378
Y'all figure your shit out
and get back at me.

18:07.461 --> 18:09.380
Where's that ZZ Top mofo at?

18:09.463 --> 18:12.466
Can a chitch
get a parking validation or what?

18:12.550 --> 18:14.677
Is there something you want to say to me?

18:15.845 --> 18:21.392
I have given everything to get where I am,
and I am not about to throw all that away.

18:21.475 --> 18:24.020
She wants an abortion?
I'm getting her an abortion.

18:24.103 --> 18:27.064
-You know this is bullshit.
-It's all bullshit, Diane.

18:27.148 --> 18:31.861
That's the gig. And you're not good enough
at this job to be too good for this job.

18:31.944 --> 18:33.613
I won't be a part of this.

18:36.157 --> 18:38.075
Yo, Beardo, where did you go?

18:38.159 --> 18:41.120
I need to get my parking validation did,
or I cannot leave.

18:41.203 --> 18:43.539
Y'all's trippin' if you think
Sextina Aquafina

18:43.623 --> 18:46.042
is paying $15 for parking.

18:48.794 --> 18:51.505
All right, new publicist.
What do you got for me?

18:51.589 --> 18:56.218
Secretariat was an athlete, right?
And you used to be an athlete.

18:56.302 --> 18:57.428
What? No, I didn't.

18:57.511 --> 19:01.223
You didn't play baseball and football?
Oh, um...

19:01.307 --> 19:03.434
You know, I think I Googled the wrong guy.

19:03.517 --> 19:07.772
-Did you think I was Bo Jackson?
-This idea I know you're going to like.

19:07.855 --> 19:09.732
You know that car wash on Alvarado?

19:09.815 --> 19:15.071
They need someone to dress up
like a gorilla and spin a sign.

19:15.154 --> 19:16.364
Why would I do that?

19:16.447 --> 19:18.741
Anything that gets your face
out there, right?

19:18.824 --> 19:21.535
How does it get my face out there
dressed like a gorilla?

19:21.619 --> 19:22.995
Maybe that one's a dud,

19:23.079 --> 19:25.831
but hey, you think Lou Bega
knocked it out of the park

19:25.915 --> 19:27.583
with "Mambo Number One"?

19:27.667 --> 19:31.337
No, but he kept at it.

19:34.924 --> 19:38.719
I'm making things all about me?
I'm the one who's having an abortion.

19:38.803 --> 19:42.139
-It's ridiculous.
-They're completely morally bankrupt.

19:42.223 --> 19:44.600
I agree with you, 247 percent.

19:44.684 --> 19:46.936
I just wrote "morally bankrupt"
on this form.

19:47.019 --> 19:50.564
You were right to do that.
This form is being very nosy right now.

19:50.648 --> 19:52.108
Why did I even take that job?

19:52.191 --> 19:55.569
You were going through a rough time,
Princess Carolyn wanted to help you

19:55.653 --> 19:57.363
and she offered you the job.

19:57.446 --> 20:01.200
Which she should not have done.
So morally bankrupt.

20:01.283 --> 20:03.244
Okay, yeah, that was nice.

20:03.327 --> 20:05.788
But still,
she is putting her company's bottom line

20:05.871 --> 20:08.958
before the very real damage
that bottle-nosed maniac

20:09.041 --> 20:11.127
is doing every time
she gets on the news and--

20:11.210 --> 20:13.295
That's it, the news.

20:13.379 --> 20:16.674
I gotta take the high road,
go on the news and rat those suckers out.

20:16.757 --> 20:18.884
Is that really a good idea?

20:18.968 --> 20:20.428
It is if you think it is,

20:20.511 --> 20:22.805
because I am here to support you
no matter what,

20:22.888 --> 20:25.808
but maybe it isn't the best idea?

20:25.891 --> 20:30.396
Like, if that idea were a Dillon brother
maybe it's a Kevin, not a Matt?

20:30.479 --> 20:34.066
Someone has to tell the world
that Sextina is a total fraud.

20:34.150 --> 20:35.985
You know Sextina Aquafina?

20:36.068 --> 20:40.990
-Oh. Yeah, I mean, I work with her.
-Oh. She is so cool.

20:41.073 --> 20:45.703
Sextina's music makes me feel strong,
like I can do anything.

20:45.786 --> 20:46.996
It doesn't offend you?

20:47.079 --> 20:48.622
What about the part where she says,

20:48.706 --> 20:51.417
"I hope and pray to God
my little fetus has a soul

20:51.500 --> 20:55.045
'cause I want it to feel pain
when I eject it from my hole"?

20:55.129 --> 20:58.007
It's a joke.
You get that it's a joke, right?

20:58.090 --> 21:00.050
Well, obviously.

21:00.134 --> 21:03.220
Do you think she actually wants
to shoot her fetus with a gun?

21:03.304 --> 21:06.640
-No, I get it.
-Getting an abortion is scary.

21:06.724 --> 21:08.350
With all the protesters out front,

21:08.434 --> 21:10.644
how you have to listen
to the heartbeat and all that.

21:10.728 --> 21:14.315
When you can joke about it,
it makes it less scary, you know?

21:14.398 --> 21:16.650
Yeah.

21:16.734 --> 21:18.027
Diane?

21:26.786 --> 21:27.995
Ana?

21:29.205 --> 21:31.040
I won't be working with Jurj anymore.

21:32.958 --> 21:34.210
I let him know this morning.

21:34.293 --> 21:36.587
First he thought I was doing
a really good prank,

21:36.670 --> 21:38.547
but eventually I think he understood.

21:38.631 --> 21:40.049
You dropped Jurj?

21:40.132 --> 21:43.928
Jurj Clooners?
Sexiest Man in America Jurj Clooners?

21:44.011 --> 21:47.223
Jurj is easy. Everyone loves him.

21:47.306 --> 21:50.684
I've got a master's degree in Publicist,
it's time to put that to use.

21:50.768 --> 21:53.771
I dropped all my other clients.
You're the underdog.

21:53.854 --> 21:58.067
I want to put all my attention on you
and get you that Oscar.

21:58.150 --> 22:00.069
So nobody else, huh? Good.

22:00.152 --> 22:02.947
Just all your hopes and dreams
pinned on me.

22:03.030 --> 22:04.490
Somehow beating the odds

22:04.573 --> 22:07.993
and winning the highest possible accolade
in an actor's career.

22:08.077 --> 22:10.371
-I know we can do it.
-Just me, huh?

22:10.454 --> 22:12.790
Wow, that's actually. That--

22:12.873 --> 22:14.834
Is someone standing on my windpipe?

22:14.917 --> 22:17.002
Let's just get Jurj on the phone so we--

22:17.086 --> 22:19.380
No, BoJack. I believe in you, okay?

22:19.964 --> 22:21.048
Okay.

22:21.131 --> 22:22.258
Whoa, Ana, what are you--?

22:22.341 --> 22:25.094
-Oh, boy.
-Shh... It's okay.

22:25.177 --> 22:29.265
-When you fired me, it was thrilling.
-Oh. Ana...

22:29.348 --> 22:31.183
Nobody talks to me like that.

22:31.267 --> 22:35.854
It reminded me that I work for you,
and I liked that.

22:35.938 --> 22:36.981
Okay, but--

22:37.064 --> 22:41.944
Do you like that?
Being in control? Being the star?

22:42.027 --> 22:43.028
Yes.

22:43.112 --> 22:46.240
You're my star, BoJack. My shining star.

22:46.323 --> 22:48.367
-But don't you ever...
-Ow, too tight.

22:48.450 --> 22:50.744
-...try to screw me again.
-Ouch! Oh, please.

22:50.828 --> 22:53.080
-Do you understand?
-Yes. God, yes.

22:53.163 --> 22:54.456
Good.

22:54.790 --> 22:59.420
I'll see you tomorrow bright and early.
You have my undivided attention now.

23:00.588 --> 23:02.756
Uh...

23:03.215 --> 23:06.051
<i>How are you feeling, Sextina?</i>

23:06.135 --> 23:09.096
<i>A little queasy</i>
<i>but on the whole, wonderful.</i>

23:09.179 --> 23:11.557
<i>Good. Now, I do accept tips.</i>

23:11.640 --> 23:15.686
-That was surprisingly tasteful.
-And educational, right?

23:15.769 --> 23:17.605
Yeah. Weirdly educational.

23:17.688 --> 23:22.860
I actually learned a lot about abortion,
and I just had an abortion.

23:22.943 --> 23:25.070
-How are you feeling?
-I feel shitty.

23:25.154 --> 23:26.614
I mean, physically.

23:26.697 --> 23:30.451
I'm glad I did it,
but mostly I just felt old.

23:30.534 --> 23:33.662
There were all these teenagers there.
Twenty-somethings.

23:33.746 --> 23:37.541
I know from the outside, it might seem
like I should be ready for kids,

23:37.625 --> 23:38.709
but I can't--

23:38.792 --> 23:42.963
Diane, you don't need
to explain anything to anyone.

23:45.466 --> 23:50.679
-Sextina. Great job, we did it.
<i>-Yeah, so, little wrinkle.</i>

23:50.763 --> 23:53.182
I've been having a lot of sex, you know,

23:53.265 --> 23:56.977
'cause I'm a sexual creature
and dolphins do have sex for pleasure.

23:57.061 --> 23:59.480
I just found out
I got knocked up for real.

23:59.563 --> 24:02.483
-What?
-And I think I want to keep it.

24:02.566 --> 24:05.569
But that might be a little confusing
to my fans,

24:05.653 --> 24:09.031
since they just saw me
get the old scoopity doopity?

24:09.114 --> 24:12.868
Okay, we're gonna handle this.
Meet us at the office in 20 minutes.

24:13.410 --> 24:16.955
First thing is we gotta get her
out of town before she starts to show.

24:17.039 --> 24:20.584
Yeah, we'll send her to that farm
where celebrities go to disappear,

24:20.668 --> 24:22.878
where Chad Michael Murray
and Thora Birch went.

24:22.961 --> 24:25.381
Film a bunch of music videos now,
and then--

24:25.464 --> 24:28.926
Release them over the next year
so it seems like she's still around.

24:29.009 --> 24:32.262
Then when she comes back,
we'll say she adopted a baby.

24:32.346 --> 24:37.017
- People are going to love that.
- Yeah. Everyone loves a baby.
