WEBVTT

00:02.077 --> 00:05.337
Wow. That body shop
earned their money.

00:05.414 --> 00:07.564
Not even a scratch
on the fender.

00:07.566 --> 00:09.657
If only I could say the same
for my husband.

00:09.735 --> 00:10.917
Norah, you heard the doctors.

00:10.994 --> 00:12.761
I'm gonna make
a full recovery.

00:14.164 --> 00:16.181
What do you think about
sushi for lunch?

00:16.258 --> 00:17.758
Is it lunchtime already?

00:17.834 --> 00:21.336
I was supposed to give you
your antibiotic a half-hour ago.

00:21.355 --> 00:22.913
I'm sure there's
some wiggle room.

00:22.915 --> 00:24.314
I don't want wiggle room.

00:25.100 --> 00:26.525
I want you to get better.

00:26.676 --> 00:29.177
It's alright, just tell me
which one it is.

00:29.196 --> 00:30.937
I'll take it right now.

00:31.014 --> 00:32.013
NORAH: I think
it's the yellow one,

00:32.033 --> 00:33.032
but I'd have to look.

00:33.183 --> 00:34.533
And I can't look
because I'm driving.

00:34.684 --> 00:36.426
Because the last time
I took my eyes off the road

00:36.445 --> 00:39.096
while I was driving,
I almost destroyed our family.

00:39.098 --> 00:40.205
Norah, no.

00:40.282 --> 00:42.207
I'm the one who flew
halfway across the world

00:42.284 --> 00:44.951
to surprise you
over a video chat.

00:45.028 --> 00:47.604
Yeah, you did do that,
didn't you?

00:47.623 --> 00:50.440
So let's make a promise
to each other right now

00:50.442 --> 00:53.277
to let it go
and focus on the future.

00:53.279 --> 00:55.796
And all the bad stuff
that happened?

00:55.872 --> 00:57.097
Ancient history.

00:57.892 --> 00:59.633
-Norah!
-(Norah screams)

00:59.709 --> 01:00.684
(screaming)

01:08.460 --> 01:10.736
I'm sorry, did you say
you ran over a knife?

01:10.887 --> 01:13.238
Norah (over phone):
<i> No, a knight.</i>
<i> In shining armor!</i>

01:13.465 --> 01:15.465
Okay, try to stay calm
for me, ma'am.

01:15.484 --> 01:17.409
-Uh, can you tell me--
-Norah:<i> My name is Norah.</i>

01:17.561 --> 01:19.727
<i> I'm at the corner</i>
<i> of 8th and Lavaca.</i>

01:19.747 --> 01:20.821
Okay.

01:20.973 --> 01:24.083
Norah, have we
spoken before?

01:25.311 --> 01:26.810
Not sure of our victim's ID yet.

01:26.812 --> 01:28.420
He's alive and talking,
but he's not making much sense.

01:28.497 --> 01:31.315
Bystanders said he was
stumbling around and yelling

01:31.333 --> 01:32.591
before he stepped
into oncoming traffic.

01:32.668 --> 01:34.334
OWEN: Well, at least
he was dressed for it.

01:34.411 --> 01:35.743
TOMMY: What about
the other people in the car?

01:35.763 --> 01:37.003
They're pretty upset.

01:37.098 --> 01:39.247
That passenger was
already carrying a leg injury,

01:39.325 --> 01:40.657
but other than that,
they seem Okay.

01:40.676 --> 01:42.083
W-wait a minute,
isn't that...

01:42.161 --> 01:43.327
-Aren't you...
-TOMMY: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:43.345 --> 01:45.162
She hit him with the car
last week.

01:45.164 --> 01:47.422
I swear this one
was not my fault.

01:47.441 --> 01:49.516
-Mateo, unplug the battery.
-MATEO: Yeah?

01:49.593 --> 01:51.926
Judd, Marjan, make sure
there isn't any fluid leaking

01:52.004 --> 01:52.853
that's gonna ignite.

01:53.005 --> 01:54.095
NANCY:
Face shield's stuck, Cap.

01:54.189 --> 01:56.097
No, no, no. Leave it alone.
Don't force it.

01:56.175 --> 01:57.449
Let's just see what
we're dealing with first.

01:57.526 --> 01:59.025
-TK, put him on the LIFEPAK.
-Copy, Cap.

01:59.178 --> 02:01.269
Okay, sir, we are
here to help.

02:01.347 --> 02:02.770
Can you tell me your name?

02:02.848 --> 02:03.847
KNIGHT: Princess Arabella.

02:04.107 --> 02:05.958
Princess Arabella,
can you tell me what day it is?

02:06.034 --> 02:07.200
KNIGHT: Princess Arabella!

02:07.277 --> 02:10.036
She's in danger.
I must save the princess.

02:10.189 --> 02:11.463
So this isn't the princess.

02:11.615 --> 02:12.464
KNIGHT: The sword!

02:12.616 --> 02:13.799
The slice! The sword!

02:13.950 --> 02:15.359
BP's spiking, Cap.

02:15.452 --> 02:18.028
We're looking at possible
orbital compartment syndrome.

02:18.030 --> 02:19.245
His eye is swelling
in his socket

02:19.247 --> 02:22.975
and the helmet's not
giving it anywhere to go.

02:23.126 --> 02:24.125
It's gotta come off

02:24.203 --> 02:26.203
and it's stuck.

02:26.221 --> 02:28.397
Anybody have a can opener?

02:29.650 --> 02:31.375
Alright, sir, this is
gonna be a little loud

02:31.468 --> 02:32.893
-so just try to relax.
-KNIGHT (weakly): The sword.

02:33.045 --> 02:34.820
The slice. The sword.

02:34.897 --> 02:35.970
It's a rotary grinder.

02:36.048 --> 02:37.614
(loud grinding)

02:39.326 --> 02:41.326
-OWEN: Alright,
Mateo, the snips.
-Yep.

02:45.482 --> 02:46.556
(groans)

02:46.558 --> 02:48.149
BP is coming back down
to earth, Cap.

02:48.169 --> 02:49.835
NANCY:
Cap, look at his lips.

02:49.986 --> 02:51.244
(coughs)

02:51.397 --> 02:52.913
And I do not like this rash.

02:53.007 --> 02:54.398
TOMMY: It's erythema.

02:54.400 --> 02:55.990
TK, put him on high-flow oxygen.

02:56.068 --> 02:57.417
This isn't a regular head wound.

02:57.494 --> 02:59.252
This is carbon monoxide
poisoning.

02:59.405 --> 03:00.995
(wheezing):
Must save...

03:01.015 --> 03:02.681
Which explains the delirium.

03:02.908 --> 03:04.349
Where's the leak?

03:05.001 --> 03:06.743
Princess Arabella.

03:06.762 --> 03:09.354
Okay, sir, I need you to tell us
where you came from.

03:09.506 --> 03:11.097
And were there any other
people with you?

03:11.250 --> 03:14.509
A bounty... forged in stone.

03:14.586 --> 03:16.028
TOMMY:
Alright, Nancy, TK,
package him up.

03:16.104 --> 03:18.530
-Take him to West Park.
-But what about you?

03:18.682 --> 03:21.849
I think Captain Strand and I
are going on a quest.

03:21.869 --> 03:23.869
GRACE:
Ooh, I'm looking and...

03:23.946 --> 03:25.612
No, I don't see
any other calls

03:25.764 --> 03:27.188
about fainting
or sickness today.

03:27.208 --> 03:30.100
Are there any movies or TV shows
shooting in the area?

03:30.118 --> 03:31.435
<i> Is there a theater nearby?</i>

03:31.437 --> 03:32.527
GRACE:
Not seeing any permits.

03:32.546 --> 03:34.213
Bass Concert Hall
is two miles away.

03:34.289 --> 03:35.772
Any chance
they're doing "Camelot"?

03:35.774 --> 03:36.940
Nope, "Guys and Dolls."

03:37.033 --> 03:39.292
Ooh, "Guys and Dolls."
Love "Guys and Dolls."

03:39.369 --> 03:40.444
Let's see.

03:40.462 --> 03:43.037
Uh, well, this could
be something.

03:43.057 --> 03:44.130
<i> About five blocks from you</i>

03:44.283 --> 03:45.966
<i> there's a novelty pizza place,</i>

03:46.118 --> 03:47.117
<i> Swords and Slices.</i>

03:47.135 --> 03:49.228
"All ye can eat
stone-fired pizza.

03:49.379 --> 03:50.120
A bounty..."

03:50.138 --> 03:51.638
Forged in stone.

03:51.715 --> 03:54.458
-He was quoting off the menu.
-Alright, we're on our way.

03:54.476 --> 03:56.126
<i> Send in R.A. units.</i>
<i> We don't have any idea</i>

03:56.144 --> 03:57.694
<i> what we're gonna find</i>
<i> when we get there.</i>

03:59.631 --> 04:01.481
MATEO: Place is closed.
We sure this is the right spot?

04:01.558 --> 04:03.659
Yeah, I reckon
it's the right spot.

04:04.987 --> 04:06.453
Ma'am?

04:07.731 --> 04:08.805
(horn honks)

04:08.824 --> 04:10.474
(siren wailing)

04:10.492 --> 04:12.501
-Ma'am!
-(siren continues)

04:15.163 --> 04:16.755
(groans weakly)

04:16.832 --> 04:19.666
Princess Arabella, I presume.

04:19.743 --> 04:21.468
Oh, my champion.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.389
(vomits)

04:26.767 --> 04:28.508
(patrons groaning)

04:28.660 --> 04:31.419
MARJAN:
It's a medieval mass casualty.

04:31.438 --> 04:32.938
JUDD:
Yeah, it's a good thing
they weren't open yet.

04:33.089 --> 04:34.773
MATEO:
CO's spiking 900 ppm, Cap.

04:34.924 --> 04:36.683
OWEN:
Yeah, here's no smoke
so it's an HVAC leak.

04:36.835 --> 04:39.336
Judd, why don't you find
the control and shut it down?

04:39.354 --> 04:40.946
Mateo, go get
the 36-inch blowers,

04:41.097 --> 04:42.839
set it up,
start ventilating this place.

04:42.858 --> 04:45.099
Marjan, let's get these
people out for some fresh air.

04:45.193 --> 04:46.343
MARJAN: Yes, milord.

04:46.361 --> 04:47.861
TOMMY: How many more
you got in there?

04:47.937 --> 04:48.954
This should be the last bunch.

04:49.105 --> 04:51.123
We're gonna need more
O2 off the truck.

04:51.199 --> 04:52.791
No good. We just used
the last cylinder of 02

04:52.868 --> 04:54.034
about five minutes ago.

04:54.186 --> 04:55.852
OWEN: How many can we
put in the ambulance?

04:55.871 --> 04:56.795
TOMMY: Three, four tops.

04:57.022 --> 04:58.112
Even if we use the fire truck,

04:58.190 --> 04:59.614
we're not gonna be able
to travel everybody.

04:59.633 --> 05:02.009
I don't think we're gonna
need the fire truck.

05:04.305 --> 05:06.212
-Hey, Judd. You take it easy.
-JUDD: Yep.

05:06.365 --> 05:08.198
I don't think our insurance
is gonna cover this.

05:08.216 --> 05:09.725
JUDD:
Alright.

05:10.886 --> 05:12.052
We should eat here sometime.

05:12.204 --> 05:13.687
The place seems dope.

05:14.481 --> 05:15.205
Really?

05:15.223 --> 05:17.065
That's your takeaway?

05:22.064 --> 05:25.407
(theme music plays)

05:27.143 --> 05:28.718
(knock on door)

05:28.720 --> 05:29.661
PAUL: Hold on.

05:32.315 --> 05:34.057
-Cap!
-Hey, hope you don't mind,

05:34.059 --> 05:35.241
I brought a few folks with me.

05:35.394 --> 05:37.394
No, not at all. Come in.
What's up?

05:37.412 --> 05:39.245
-Love the beard.
-Thank you.

05:39.322 --> 05:40.988
-So rugged.
-Thank you.

05:41.066 --> 05:42.632
-What's up?
-What's up, man?

05:43.585 --> 05:45.085
That, uh, that's everyone?

05:45.237 --> 05:47.070
Oh, that's it.

05:47.089 --> 05:48.162
Yeah, Marjan, couldn't make it.

05:48.215 --> 05:50.182
She, uh...
She had that thing.

05:50.333 --> 05:52.017
-The roller derby. The...
-At the mosque.

05:54.262 --> 05:56.246
That's cool.
So what'd y'all bring me?

05:56.339 --> 05:57.856
You wouldn't happen to have
any deep dish pizza

05:57.933 --> 05:59.265
in one of those bags, would you?

05:59.418 --> 06:01.526
OWEN:
No, but I did bring you
the next best thing.

06:01.678 --> 06:04.363
It's my antioxidant
Brussels sprout salad.

06:04.439 --> 06:05.530
PAUL: Ah...

06:05.607 --> 06:07.682
It might be the next
next best thing.

06:07.701 --> 06:10.944
(laughs) But we do have wine,
which is not only allowed,

06:11.038 --> 06:12.429
it is medically encouraged.

06:12.447 --> 06:13.372
God bless you.

06:13.448 --> 06:14.598
NANCY: I'll start decanting.

06:14.691 --> 06:16.357
You cool if we set up shop
in your kitchen?

06:16.377 --> 06:18.418
Yeah, no problem.
Everything's in there.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.028
So how are you feeling?

06:21.106 --> 06:22.772
Uh, better actually.
I feel good.

06:22.866 --> 06:25.050
Well, I want you to know
that it's taking

06:25.160 --> 06:26.367
every bit of my self-control

06:26.445 --> 06:28.720
not to check
your vitals right now.

06:28.872 --> 06:30.037
No need. I saw the doctor.

06:30.057 --> 06:31.372
He said my EKG is normal

06:31.466 --> 06:33.332
and that my scar tissue
is healing "beautifully."

06:33.485 --> 06:36.228
-That's great.
-Did he say when you can
come back to work?

06:36.455 --> 06:38.805
Not yet. I'm just waiting
for my strength to get back.

06:38.957 --> 06:42.475
You know, it's okay.
Everyone recuperates
at their own pace.

06:42.628 --> 06:45.570
Yeah, I'm reading
"Gulag Archipelago Volume 2."

06:45.722 --> 06:46.738
(all laughing)

06:47.056 --> 06:48.648
See his face when he heard
that Marj couldn't come?

06:48.800 --> 06:51.818
Yeah. Like his dog didn't
make it home from the vet.

06:51.970 --> 06:53.227
Are they still not talking?

06:53.305 --> 06:55.247
I don't think so but
it's hard to know for sure.

06:55.323 --> 06:57.398
because neither of them
will talk about it.

06:57.418 --> 07:00.085
No, this has gone on
long enough.

07:00.162 --> 07:01.903
Somebody's gotta
straighten her out.

07:01.955 --> 07:03.830
Amen, brother.

07:03.907 --> 07:05.507
-Hmm?
-I mean, I would...

07:06.485 --> 07:08.260
absolutely.

07:08.336 --> 07:10.578
But I just feel like
this is more of a...

07:10.656 --> 07:12.580
(whispering):
firefighter-to-firefighter
thing.

07:12.599 --> 07:15.325
-Agreed. Yep.
-Mm-hmm.

07:15.418 --> 07:17.436
-JUDD: Mateo.
-Oh, she's like my big sister.

07:17.512 --> 07:20.439
Like a very intimidating
big sister.

07:20.515 --> 07:22.849
Y'all are a bunch
of yellow bellies, man.

07:22.926 --> 07:24.668
(phone buzzing)

07:24.686 --> 07:25.444
MATEO: Hello?

07:25.762 --> 07:27.112
...a break between
taking out the...

07:27.263 --> 07:28.613
MATEO: Yeah, this is him.

07:29.357 --> 07:30.840
Where?

07:30.859 --> 07:32.075
Oh, sure.

07:33.011 --> 07:34.511
That's weird.

07:34.529 --> 07:36.362
That was a bartender
at the Rustwood Tavern.

07:36.515 --> 07:39.365
They want me
to come pick up my dad.

07:39.367 --> 07:41.275
What's your dad doing
at a badge and ladder bar?

07:41.295 --> 07:44.946
I have no idea.
He doesn't drink.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.506
Also, he's in Guadalajara.

07:50.529 --> 07:52.137
Hey. Mateo Chavez.

07:52.288 --> 07:54.598
I got a call, they said
to come pick up my dad.

07:55.458 --> 07:57.309
He's over there.

07:57.460 --> 07:59.478
Your mother must have
been better-lookin'.

08:08.880 --> 08:10.822
Captain Tatum? What's going on?

08:10.899 --> 08:13.066
Hey, Chavez. Pull up a stump.

08:13.218 --> 08:14.493
Whoa, what happened?
Did you get in a fight?

08:14.569 --> 08:17.237
-Uh, slipped in the can,
no big deal.
-Hey!

08:17.313 --> 08:19.146
Why didn't you
call an ambulance?

08:19.166 --> 08:20.314
'Cause he told me
he'd break my head

08:20.334 --> 08:21.666
if I called anybody but you.

08:21.893 --> 08:23.668
(laughs)
True story.

08:23.820 --> 08:27.321
Wipe that "poor you" look
off your face, Chavez. I'm fine.

08:27.341 --> 08:29.758
We'll see about that.
Here, follow my finger, Cap.

08:30.752 --> 08:32.268
Which one?

08:32.270 --> 08:35.013
(laughs) I'm kidding ya, kid.
Alright.

08:35.164 --> 08:37.474
Well, good news is I don't think
you have a concussion.

08:38.410 --> 08:40.018
Bad news is you're gonna have

08:40.095 --> 08:41.520
a terrible hangover
in the morning.

08:41.596 --> 08:45.749
A few push-ups, a cold shower,
I'll be fine.

08:45.767 --> 08:47.433
So what's going on, Cap?

08:47.510 --> 08:50.028
Why did you tell the bartender
I was your son?

08:50.179 --> 08:53.273
I did tell him that, didn't I?

08:53.425 --> 08:56.442
Because I knew
my own degenerate progeny

08:56.519 --> 08:58.261
wouldn't be there
to answer the call

08:58.263 --> 09:01.289
in my hour of need.

09:02.376 --> 09:04.376
Yeah, I heard about
Lieutenant Darby.

09:05.546 --> 09:08.195
Apartment fire
over on 5th Street.

09:08.273 --> 09:10.698
You know, I really thought
he was gonna pull through.

09:10.717 --> 09:13.534
I prayed every day he'd
make it out of the hospital.

09:13.628 --> 09:15.720
Next time, pray harder.

09:17.165 --> 09:20.433
Left behind a wife and a kid,
a little boy.

09:21.803 --> 09:23.436
Hell of a thing, huh?

09:26.215 --> 09:27.624
Bartender?

09:27.626 --> 09:31.385
Two more whiskeys for me
and my friend here, please.

09:31.387 --> 09:35.148
Sorry, Captain,
I serve you anymore
and I can go to jail.

09:35.300 --> 09:38.225
What the hell happened
to this country anyway?

09:38.245 --> 09:39.485
What happened to freedom?

09:39.580 --> 09:41.580
I'll explain it to you
on the way home.

09:41.698 --> 09:42.822
Come on, let's go.

09:42.899 --> 09:44.332
(groans)

09:45.143 --> 09:46.376
Let's go.

09:46.920 --> 09:47.977
TATUM: Oh.

09:47.996 --> 09:49.996
Think I stood up
a little too soon.

09:50.073 --> 09:51.072
(Mateo laughs)

09:51.091 --> 09:52.816
Do you know where I live,
Chavez?

09:52.834 --> 09:54.109
No, I don't.

09:54.111 --> 09:56.011
That's unfortunate.

10:02.936 --> 10:05.312
(snoring)

10:08.257 --> 10:10.257
Hey, hey.
Mateo, why is there

10:10.277 --> 10:12.527
a drooling fire captain
on my couch?

10:14.356 --> 10:17.190
Yeah, he was in
a bad way last night.

10:17.266 --> 10:19.008
He lost one of his guys.

10:19.027 --> 10:21.602
Yeah.
His Lieutenant, I heard.

10:21.622 --> 10:22.603
Darby.

10:22.789 --> 10:24.681
And you've been looking
after him all night?

10:24.699 --> 10:26.866
Yeah, I didn't want him
to choke on his vomit.

10:27.018 --> 10:28.460
-(snoring)
-And also I read people

10:28.611 --> 10:31.129
can snore so bad,
they suffocate.

10:31.280 --> 10:32.856
So he seemed like a double risk.

10:32.858 --> 10:34.858
Yeah. No kidding.

10:34.876 --> 10:35.875
(snores)

10:35.952 --> 10:38.027
Hey, Captain Tatum.

10:38.046 --> 10:39.863
How are you doing?

10:39.881 --> 10:42.289
Strand?
What are you doin' here?

10:42.367 --> 10:44.792
-I live here.
-Where's here?

10:44.811 --> 10:45.885
Captain Strand's house.

10:45.962 --> 10:47.520
I brought you here last night.

10:48.965 --> 10:50.464
What the hell time is it?

10:50.542 --> 10:51.224
OWEN: 8:45.

10:51.376 --> 10:52.892
TATUM: Crap, I gotta go.

10:53.044 --> 10:54.377
I got Darby's service.

10:54.379 --> 10:56.303
Wait, I thought you said
that was Saturday.

10:56.381 --> 10:57.656
That's the formal funeral.

10:57.807 --> 10:59.215
This is the church service

10:59.217 --> 11:00.992
for just the 129 and his family.

11:01.069 --> 11:03.887
I'm supposed to give
a damn eulogy.

11:03.889 --> 11:05.146
Whoa!

11:05.165 --> 11:07.907
You got this room
on a damn gimbal?

11:07.984 --> 11:09.225
Look at me, man.

11:09.244 --> 11:11.318
I can't even get
my damn ass upright.

11:11.338 --> 11:13.246
You know what?
I have a hangover cure

11:13.398 --> 11:15.298
that is the stuff of legend.

11:16.568 --> 11:19.260
-What the hell is that?
-Turmeric root.

11:22.240 --> 11:25.241
Even if your witch's brew
does the trick...

11:25.243 --> 11:27.911
I don't know
how I'm gonna face them.

11:27.929 --> 11:30.246
Darby's wife and kid, my guys,

11:30.248 --> 11:31.915
they're all gonna be
looking at me

11:31.933 --> 11:33.024
for profound wisdom

11:33.101 --> 11:34.984
to make sense out of this.

11:35.770 --> 11:37.178
And I got nothin'.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.679
OWEN:
Well, just speak
from your heart.

11:38.757 --> 11:40.532
Try not to throw up.

11:42.018 --> 11:43.326
It'll be fine.

11:44.112 --> 11:45.704
I'll go with you.

11:46.598 --> 11:48.114
You will?

11:48.191 --> 11:50.375
You said the service
is for the 129.

11:50.526 --> 11:52.359
Well, I may be back
with the 126,

11:52.437 --> 11:53.786
but those months under you,

11:53.863 --> 11:55.463
under Lieutenant Darby...

11:56.291 --> 11:57.790
they meant a lot to me.

11:57.867 --> 12:01.386
(subdued music playing)

12:08.395 --> 12:09.728
(Judd sighs)

12:10.638 --> 12:11.688
(clicks tongue)

12:12.899 --> 12:14.640
-JUDD: Hey, Marwani.
-Hey.

12:14.717 --> 12:16.067
I like that...

12:16.260 --> 12:17.293
bedroll, you got going.

12:17.312 --> 12:19.312
It's nice.
You got it nice and smooth.

12:19.464 --> 12:21.222
-Got a nice little tuck.
-Thank you.

12:21.299 --> 12:22.982
Alright, there's nary a crease.

12:23.134 --> 12:24.534
The whole thing is good.

12:27.305 --> 12:28.496
Judd...

12:29.899 --> 12:31.249
why are you being awkward?

12:31.918 --> 12:33.326
I'm not being awkward.

12:33.402 --> 12:35.712
You just said, "nary."
You're being awkward.

12:36.739 --> 12:37.714
What's going on?

12:39.150 --> 12:41.651
So... (sighs)

12:41.653 --> 12:44.078
A few of us went over
to Paul's house last night

12:44.155 --> 12:45.913
just to see how he's doing.

12:45.991 --> 12:47.432
Yeah, I heard.
How is he doing?

12:47.583 --> 12:49.768
Oh, he's, he's, you know,
he's good. He's good.

12:49.919 --> 12:51.936
He's gettin' his strength back.

12:52.088 --> 12:54.272
-He's growing his beard out.
-Really?

12:54.274 --> 12:56.608
How's that look?
I can't even picture it.

12:56.759 --> 12:58.351
It suits him.

12:58.427 --> 13:00.261
Yeah, Nancy said she thought
it looked rugged.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.338
I'd agree with her, except...

13:02.340 --> 13:04.007
you know, it was 6:00 p.m.

13:04.025 --> 13:05.691
and he has
pajama pants on, so...

13:06.286 --> 13:08.194
-Oh.
-He's smiling.

13:08.346 --> 13:10.104
You know, he's sayin'
all the right things,

13:10.181 --> 13:13.458
but in my opinion,
he's depressed

13:13.609 --> 13:15.184
and he needs
his best friend back.

13:15.186 --> 13:16.686
Here we go.

13:16.688 --> 13:19.280
And I know you two have been
freezing each other out, I know,

13:19.299 --> 13:21.132
but I think it's time
for that to stop.

13:21.209 --> 13:22.616
Nope. You've got
that twisted, Judd.

13:22.636 --> 13:27.196
Wait, so you guys actually
are speaking to each other?

13:27.215 --> 13:29.215
The night Paul
had his heart attack,

13:29.367 --> 13:31.551
I felt his rib crack
while I gave him CPR.

13:31.703 --> 13:35.221
I stayed up in that waiting room
all night praying he'd wake up.

13:35.298 --> 13:37.464
And when he did,
you know what he said to me?

13:37.542 --> 13:40.376
He told me he couldn't
look at me and to get out.

13:40.395 --> 13:42.970
I have called and texted him
every day since,

13:42.989 --> 13:44.380
and not once has he responded.

13:44.399 --> 13:46.157
So, no, I'm not
freezing him out.

13:46.234 --> 13:47.659
He's freezing me out.

13:49.721 --> 13:52.479
I'm sorry, kiddo. I didn't know.

13:52.557 --> 13:55.816
The last time I went through
his door, I had to kick it in.

13:55.894 --> 13:57.460
I'm not doing that again.

13:58.396 --> 13:59.963
This time he needs to open it.

14:03.826 --> 14:05.260
TATUM:<i> Morning, everyone.</i>

14:06.162 --> 14:08.329
My name is Jack Tatum.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.423
I had the...

14:10.499 --> 14:13.259
privilege to ride the engine
with Leo Darby

14:13.336 --> 14:17.522
for all 18 of his years
at the 129.

14:18.766 --> 14:21.084
I know today is...

14:21.086 --> 14:26.239
one of sorrow,
but it's also one of pride too.

14:27.092 --> 14:29.659
We're all so proud of Leo.

14:31.705 --> 14:35.039
Now, I've never been
much of a churchgoing man,

14:35.191 --> 14:37.959
so I can't offer you
prayers or...

14:38.861 --> 14:41.880
insights about eternity.

14:42.031 --> 14:45.383
But I hope this may
give you some...

14:46.961 --> 14:48.595
comfort today.

14:50.298 --> 14:52.782
♪

14:52.784 --> 14:57.211
I've carried this webbing
with me for 37 years.

14:57.288 --> 14:59.305
My first captain gave it to me

14:59.382 --> 15:02.358
on my last day as a probie.

15:03.811 --> 15:05.361
Captain Collins.

hear it again.

15:15.064 --> 15:16.998

15:17.918 --> 15:19.751
The webbing represents...

15:20.921 --> 15:22.337
the link...

15:22.997 --> 15:24.714
the connection to...

15:30.263 --> 15:33.014
As Captain Collins
would say, he...

15:34.601 --> 15:35.725
He'd say...

This webbing...

15:40.999 --> 15:42.273
Yeah.

15:45.779 --> 15:47.403
It's a symbol.

15:50.283 --> 15:52.341
You all have heard this
a million times before,

15:52.435 --> 15:55.328
but, damn it,
you're gonna hear it again.

15:56.790 --> 15:58.790
My first captain...

15:58.792 --> 16:00.458
Captain Collins...

16:01.944 --> 16:03.461
he'd say...

16:05.298 --> 16:08.257
"As long as you hang on
to one end of it..."

"As long as you're hanging on

16:21.147 --> 16:23.564
"someone is
hanging on to you.

And it's purely theoretical.

Let's say, you know
something about someone

19:04.535 --> 19:07.127
This kid pulled me back
from the abyss.

19:07.180 --> 19:09.147
-He's a good egg.
-Yeah, he's the best.

19:09.298 --> 19:12.316
TATUM: Which is why
I'm here today, Chavez.

19:12.393 --> 19:16.136
With Darby gone,
I lost my second in command.

19:16.214 --> 19:17.989
I want you to take his place.

19:20.976 --> 19:22.142
But Darby was a lieutenant.

19:22.236 --> 19:25.388
Well, I was hoping
the double bump might be enough

19:25.406 --> 19:28.583
to entice you
to consider the offer.

19:30.912 --> 19:32.378
(exhales deeply)

19:34.174 --> 19:35.489
I mean,
with all due respect, sir,

19:35.566 --> 19:36.990
are you sure you're
in the right frame of mind

19:37.068 --> 19:38.176
to be making
this decision right now?

19:38.178 --> 19:41.904
It's true, I'm grieving.

19:41.906 --> 19:46.333
And I know how much
you love Captain Strand here
and the 126.

19:46.352 --> 19:48.978
But as humbling
as it is to say...

19:50.005 --> 19:51.397
I need you, kid.

19:53.267 --> 19:55.175
OWEN: Look, we know
it's a big decision,

19:55.253 --> 19:58.421
and we want you to take
as much time as you need

19:58.439 --> 19:59.197
to figure out--

19:59.348 --> 20:00.865
-I'll do it.
-Wh-what?

20:00.942 --> 20:02.441
That's my boy!

20:02.593 --> 20:04.327
Get over here, son!

20:07.448 --> 20:08.447
I'm so sorry, Cap.

20:08.599 --> 20:10.374
No, no, you don't
need to be sorry.

20:10.451 --> 20:13.461
I mean, uh, I mean,
I'm-I'm happy for you.

20:14.105 --> 20:15.671
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

20:17.124 --> 20:19.199
I could have strangled
the little betrayer.

20:19.277 --> 20:21.052
He said "yes" just like that?

20:21.203 --> 20:22.386
Oh, jumped at it.

20:22.463 --> 20:25.781
I mean, at least pretend
to be conflicted, right?

20:25.783 --> 20:27.225
That's what I did
with my second wife

20:27.301 --> 20:28.893
when she asked for a divorce,

20:29.044 --> 20:30.210
I managed to look sad.

20:30.288 --> 20:32.805
(laughs)
Well, Mateo ain't your wife.

20:32.957 --> 20:34.065
You can't fault the kid.

20:34.234 --> 20:36.809
I mean, going from probie
to lieutenant in one year?

20:36.885 --> 20:38.294
It's a big pay jump.

20:38.296 --> 20:40.387
Yeah, I guess
I was just blindsided.

20:40.465 --> 20:43.407
Didn't expect to be down
a team member when
I woke up this morning.

20:43.559 --> 20:44.525
Two team members.

20:45.745 --> 20:47.894
Billy didn't offer you
another captaincy, did he?

20:47.972 --> 20:49.989
No, no.
I ain't talking about me.

20:50.083 --> 20:51.231
I'm talking about Paul.

20:51.251 --> 20:53.158
Oh, Paul. Paul's fine.
He's on the mend.

20:53.235 --> 20:55.086
He's this close to coming back.

20:55.237 --> 20:56.254
I mean, you saw him last night.

20:56.405 --> 20:58.256
Yeah, evidently you didn't.

20:58.332 --> 21:00.165
'Cause what I saw was a man
who's let himself go.

21:00.318 --> 21:02.367
Right, 'cause of
a little five o'clock shadow

21:02.428 --> 21:04.153
and the afternoon PJs?

21:04.171 --> 21:07.247
Come on, his body
has been through a trauma.
He's recuperating.

21:07.267 --> 21:09.433
Marjan said that he's basically
cut her out of his life.

21:09.585 --> 21:11.994
Alright? He ain't answering
her calls, texts, nothing.

21:12.013 --> 21:13.329
I thought they were besties.

21:13.347 --> 21:15.439
Yeah, it's what's
got me so concerned.

21:15.516 --> 21:18.109
I mean,
I ain't trying to be dramatic,

21:18.260 --> 21:21.112
but when I had PTSD,
that's what I did to Grace.

21:21.263 --> 21:22.613
You think Paul has PTSD?

21:22.690 --> 21:24.356
And like you said,
he's been through trauma.

21:24.509 --> 21:27.451
Now he's pushing away
all the people
who are closest to him.

21:27.603 --> 21:30.288
Well, maybe it's time
for us to push back.

21:32.517 --> 21:34.959
-(knock on door)
-JUDD: Come on Strickland,
open up.

21:35.036 --> 21:36.961
Hey! Uh, uh, hang on.

21:37.855 --> 21:39.463
(knocking continues)

21:45.287 --> 21:46.637
Hey, what are y'all doing here?

21:46.789 --> 21:51.383
Well, we were thinking about
maybe taking you out for a beer.

21:51.477 --> 21:53.144
PAUL: Damn, I wish y'all
would've called first.

21:53.295 --> 21:55.128
I'm kinda in the middle
of something.

21:55.148 --> 21:57.723
Like a... like a donut bender.

21:57.800 --> 22:00.651
You still got some of
the powdered sugar
in your beard.

22:02.655 --> 22:05.323
-What's really going on?
-Uh, nothing's going on.

22:05.474 --> 22:07.825
Can't a man put his feet up
with some sugary
processed foods?

22:07.902 --> 22:08.826
I'm recovering.

22:08.977 --> 22:11.662
You got the same
crusty-ass PJs on

22:11.814 --> 22:12.496
you did three days ago.

22:12.648 --> 22:13.722
These are just similar ones.

22:13.741 --> 22:15.891
It doesn't feel like
you're recovering.

22:15.893 --> 22:17.076
It feels like you're retreating.

22:17.228 --> 22:18.336
Says the guy
who ran off into the woods

22:18.487 --> 22:19.411
when 126 shut down.

22:19.672 --> 22:21.339
Yeah, and running off
didn't do me any good.

22:21.490 --> 22:24.491
You can't hide from your demons.
Gotta fight 'em.

22:24.569 --> 22:26.177
(murmuring):
I don't know.

22:26.328 --> 22:27.828
I don't think I can, Cap.

22:27.847 --> 22:29.238
Because mine are inside of me.

22:29.256 --> 22:31.331
I mean, do you have
any idea what that's like

22:31.351 --> 22:33.258
to not be able to trust
your own heart to keep beating?

22:33.411 --> 22:36.020
No, we don't.
But you're not the first person

22:36.097 --> 22:37.021
to ever get a pacemaker.

22:37.172 --> 22:38.414
It's not a pacemaker.

22:38.432 --> 22:40.082
It's an internal defibrillator.

22:40.084 --> 22:41.341
Sounds a whole lot worse,
don't it?

22:41.419 --> 22:43.176
Well, it's certainly
harder to say.

22:43.196 --> 22:44.436
I mean, I read about it
and it says

22:44.589 --> 22:46.438
that you should be good as new,
you know.

22:46.515 --> 22:49.108
It ain't like it's gonna
be that different.

22:49.202 --> 22:51.535
(clicks tongue)
I am different, Judd.

22:51.612 --> 22:53.454
Ever since they
put this thing in me, I--

22:54.523 --> 22:57.023
my arms and legs
feel like cement.

22:57.101 --> 22:59.602
My energy
and my strength is gone.

22:59.620 --> 23:02.287
And, I don't know,
my reflexes are shot.

23:03.441 --> 23:05.641
I'm just waiting
for this thing to zap me.

23:05.643 --> 23:06.717
Hey, Paul.

23:08.203 --> 23:10.112
Reflexes look
pretty good to me.

23:10.131 --> 23:12.297
Alright, why don't you
get some sleep?

23:12.392 --> 23:13.891
You got a big day tomorrow.

23:14.042 --> 23:15.300
We'll come by about 8:00 a.m.

23:15.377 --> 23:17.085
Just make sure
you got your running shoes.

23:17.087 --> 23:19.021
Wait, where are we going?

23:19.732 --> 23:21.457
You'll see.

23:21.459 --> 23:22.883
You guys are really annoying,
you know that?

23:22.902 --> 23:24.309
Hey. Hey, Cap?

23:24.462 --> 23:26.145
What would have happened
if I didn't catch this remote?

23:26.297 --> 23:28.130
I had faith in you.

23:28.132 --> 23:30.366
And the department's
got a great dental.

23:34.972 --> 23:36.455
(rapid knocking on door)

23:38.976 --> 23:40.142
Marj, what the heck?

23:40.161 --> 23:42.378
Funny, I came to ask you
the same question.

23:43.497 --> 23:47.091
is it true
that you're leaving the 126?

23:51.172 --> 23:54.098
-Yeah.
-Unbelievable.

23:54.249 --> 23:56.583
After you giving me
so much crap last year

23:56.602 --> 23:58.827
for wanting to go back
to Miami to get married,

23:58.829 --> 24:00.921
and now you think you can
just slip out the back door

24:00.998 --> 24:02.331
without so much as a goodbye?

24:02.333 --> 24:04.090
Marj, I wanted to tell you. I...

24:04.110 --> 24:05.334
I just didn't know what to say.

24:05.503 --> 24:07.260
No, it's not that
you didn't know what to say.

24:07.338 --> 24:09.095
It's that there's
no easy way to say it,

24:09.173 --> 24:10.614
that you're an abandoner.

24:10.691 --> 24:12.265
An abandoner?

24:12.285 --> 24:14.343
-I am not an abandoner.
-Oh, you're an abandoner.

24:14.345 --> 24:16.178
Abandoning us
for a stupid pay raise.

24:16.197 --> 24:18.122
You're so wrong.
It's not even about the money.

24:18.199 --> 24:20.374
Okay, then, Mateo,
tell me what it is about.

24:21.109 --> 24:23.519
It's... Captain Tatum.

24:23.521 --> 24:25.963
He's... he's going through
a lot right now and...

24:27.282 --> 24:28.114
He needs me there for him.

24:28.134 --> 24:31.210
Look, I am so sorry

24:31.362 --> 24:32.861
that he lost one of his guys.

24:32.863 --> 24:34.346
It is a tragedy.

24:35.475 --> 24:38.050
-But he is not your family.
-Yes, he is.

24:38.202 --> 24:40.202
And you should talk
because I've seen

24:40.221 --> 24:41.887
how you do your family lately.

24:41.964 --> 24:43.314
What is that supposed to mean?

24:43.465 --> 24:44.982
Paul's twisting
in the breeze right now,

24:45.059 --> 24:46.391
and you won't
so much as lift a finger.

24:46.468 --> 24:48.468
Lift a finger?
I saved his life!

24:48.488 --> 24:50.303
Well, he needs a lot more
from you than that.

24:50.323 --> 24:52.231
Well, then he needs
to ask me for it!

24:52.383 --> 24:53.324
Yeah, well, you don't
always need to get

24:53.551 --> 24:55.659
a written invitation
to go help someone.

24:57.330 --> 24:59.663
You're really gonna turn this
all back on me right now?

25:01.167 --> 25:03.334
You're like a guilt trip ninja.

25:03.911 --> 25:06.078
Marj...

25:06.080 --> 25:08.088
I'm really not trying
to make you feel bad.

25:10.826 --> 25:12.901
You know, lately I've been
wondering why I bothered

25:12.903 --> 25:16.755
to fight so hard
to get the 126 back together.

25:16.832 --> 25:19.558
Would have been so much easier
to just give up.

25:20.836 --> 25:22.561
Just like everybody else.

25:26.359 --> 25:27.933
(door opens)

25:28.085 --> 25:29.360
(door slams)

25:33.941 --> 25:36.592
(funky music playing)

25:36.610 --> 25:38.744
♪

25:43.934 --> 25:45.209
Lieutenant?

25:45.360 --> 25:47.294
Excuse me, Lieutenant?

25:47.955 --> 25:49.195
Talking to me?

25:49.215 --> 25:50.956
You're Lieutenant Chavez, right?

25:51.108 --> 25:52.457
Oh, yeah.
(chuckles)

25:52.576 --> 25:55.201
It's the first time
I'm hearing it out loud.

25:55.279 --> 25:57.129
Welcome back to the 129.

25:57.281 --> 25:58.889
MATEO: Good to be back.

25:58.966 --> 26:00.115
Hey, I didn't get your name.

26:00.117 --> 26:01.392
Probie Barrett.

26:01.468 --> 26:04.044
But everybody
just calls me "Grunt."

26:04.121 --> 26:05.646
Well, it's nice
to meet you, Barrett.

26:07.233 --> 26:09.716
-Can I take your bag?
-Oh, no. It's all good.

26:09.735 --> 26:11.126
-I got it.
-Please.

26:11.128 --> 26:12.461
If Captain Tatum sees
his new lieutenant

26:12.463 --> 26:14.220
carrying his own bag
next to his probie...

26:14.298 --> 26:17.324
-It's latrine duty for a week.
-Yeah.

26:19.136 --> 26:21.620
-Oh. Thank you.
-Yeah, man.

26:25.142 --> 26:26.642
You want a coffee, Lieutenant?

26:26.660 --> 26:29.420
No, I'm more of
an extreme energy drink guy.

26:29.496 --> 26:31.922
Tell me what kinds,
they'll be in the fridge
by lunch.

26:32.074 --> 26:34.166
What do you think
you're doing, Grunt?

26:34.318 --> 26:35.984
I was just getting him
situated, sir.

26:36.003 --> 26:38.262
Not you, dummy, him.

26:40.082 --> 26:41.682
Why are you here?

26:43.510 --> 26:45.177
You know what,
on second thought, Barrett,

26:45.253 --> 26:46.979
I think I'll take that coffee.

26:50.109 --> 26:51.667
Sir...

26:51.685 --> 26:55.696
I'm here because you hired me
to replace Darby, remember?

26:57.099 --> 26:59.508
Of course, I remember.

26:59.510 --> 27:03.746
Would you relax?
I'm just... bustin' your balls.

27:05.124 --> 27:06.498
(Tatum laughs)

27:11.689 --> 27:15.374
Oh, no. I'm telling you guys,
this is a bad idea.

27:15.468 --> 27:17.301
OWEN:
You wanna start feeling
like yourself again?

27:17.378 --> 27:20.529
You gotta pass this test
so you can get back to work.

27:20.531 --> 27:23.198
Yeah, but what if I have
a heart attack and die?

27:23.291 --> 27:24.883
Based on your health, your age,

27:24.960 --> 27:26.869
it's a statistical
impossibility.

27:26.871 --> 27:28.220
Isn't that right, Tommy?

27:28.372 --> 27:30.389
-It's very unlikely, yes.
-So you hear that?

27:30.465 --> 27:32.465
A medical professional
just told you you're fine.

27:32.485 --> 27:34.376
Okay, see, that is not
what I heard her say.

27:34.395 --> 27:36.528
Tommy, what do you really think?

27:37.064 --> 27:38.489
I think that...

27:40.159 --> 27:41.733
if your heart
does something abnormal,

27:41.810 --> 27:45.070
that device will shock it back
into normal rhythm.

27:45.072 --> 27:46.980
Okay, and what is that
gonna feel like?

27:47.057 --> 27:48.999
Oh, I can't tell you
from experience.

27:49.151 --> 27:51.560
What have you heard?

27:51.578 --> 27:54.004
I've heard it's a little bit
like being kicked in the chest

27:54.081 --> 27:55.989
by a mule.

27:56.066 --> 27:58.008
-No, I'm out.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

27:58.160 --> 27:59.584
I've been kicked
in the chest by a mule.

27:59.586 --> 28:01.178
-It ain't nothing.
-No, you haven't. You're lying.

28:01.255 --> 28:02.754
-I'm not lying.
-No, you're lying.

28:02.831 --> 28:04.181
I can tell, your eyebrow arches

28:04.408 --> 28:05.257
every time you tell a lie, man.

28:05.409 --> 28:07.351
It's true.
It's your poker tell.

28:08.579 --> 28:10.354
Alright, I've never been
kicked by a mule,

28:10.431 --> 28:12.690
but I have had my ass
kicked by PTSD.

28:12.766 --> 28:14.766
And every time

38:46.049 --> 38:48.158
(whooping)

38:48.234 --> 38:51.143
You have 10 minutes, 20 seconds
to complete the course.

38:51.221 --> 38:52.978
-Are you ready?
-Do it.

38:52.998 --> 38:54.372
Get set.

38:55.892 --> 38:57.542
(heart thumping)

39:01.506 --> 39:02.246
Go.

39:02.399 --> 39:04.632
(cheering)

39:05.993 --> 39:07.427
(whooping)

39:08.162 --> 39:09.471
You got this.

39:09.997 --> 39:11.639
(cheering)

39:18.098 --> 39:20.190
MARJAN:
Strictly Strickland!

39:20.341 --> 39:21.766
Yeah.

39:21.843 --> 39:23.234
(mouths):
Go, buddy.

39:24.529 --> 39:26.321
(defibrillator crackles)

39:27.941 --> 39:29.682
TOMMY: Paul!
Paul, look at me.

39:29.701 --> 39:30.867
Look at me.

39:30.944 --> 39:32.927
Right here, right here,
look at me.

39:32.929 --> 39:34.353
Look at me.

39:34.373 --> 39:36.931
Alright, you okay?
You alright?

39:36.950 --> 39:38.099
Yeah, you weren't lying.

39:38.118 --> 39:39.358
Kicks like a mule.

39:39.378 --> 39:42.437
This is my fault.
I brought him back too fast.

39:42.455 --> 39:44.606
-(groans)
-TOMMY: Alright. Easy.

39:44.624 --> 39:45.773
Come on.

39:45.792 --> 39:46.958
(groans)

39:47.034 --> 39:48.551
I appreciate that, Cap, but...

39:49.446 --> 39:50.870
you're eating into my time.

39:50.889 --> 39:52.222
What are you talking about?

39:52.373 --> 39:54.891
(Paul panting)
My heart's okay.

39:55.042 --> 39:56.876
I can do this.

39:56.895 --> 39:58.286
Go! Go! Go!

39:58.304 --> 40:00.263
You're wasting time, let's go!

40:00.415 --> 40:02.315
(cheering)

40:03.050 --> 40:04.884
Is he gonna be alright?

40:04.903 --> 40:06.486
TOMMY: Lookin' good!

40:07.631 --> 40:08.571
Yeah.

40:09.891 --> 40:11.574
Yeah, he's gonna be just fine.

40:19.309 --> 40:20.625
TATUM: Hey, Chavez.

40:22.162 --> 40:23.753
Captain Tatum?

40:23.830 --> 40:24.829
What are the odds?

40:24.981 --> 40:26.506
A lot better than you think.

40:29.243 --> 40:30.593
You want a drink?

40:30.745 --> 40:32.411
The other night you were
all about the whiskeys.

40:32.431 --> 40:34.597
(taps bar)
Bartender, two more whiskeys.

40:34.674 --> 40:36.766
I think you've had enough
for one sitting, son.

40:36.843 --> 40:38.518
-Let's get you home.
-No.

40:39.604 --> 40:41.271
You don't want me in your car.

40:42.607 --> 40:44.015
I can't ride in your car
like this.

40:44.091 --> 40:46.759
Sure you can.
Just lean your head
out the window

40:46.836 --> 40:48.186
like a Labradoodle.

40:48.262 --> 40:50.530
Puke on the door,
you can clean it up later.

40:54.101 --> 40:55.368
I mean like a Judas.

41:01.034 --> 41:02.459
I betrayed you, Cap.

41:06.189 --> 41:08.089
I went to the department today
and...

41:10.860 --> 41:11.968
I...

41:15.456 --> 41:18.224
Told them about
the bats in my belfry?

41:20.461 --> 41:21.536
You knew?

41:21.721 --> 41:24.731
Chief called me the second
you left the office.

41:26.392 --> 41:27.567
Are you mad?

41:28.394 --> 41:29.694
I'm not mad.

41:30.972 --> 41:32.071
Is it...

41:32.974 --> 41:34.065
Is it because you're confused?

41:34.159 --> 41:37.994
No, I'm not confused,
damn it, I'm grateful.

41:38.071 --> 41:40.071
Grateful? Grateful for what?

41:40.147 --> 41:42.624
Because you kept me
from killing anyone.

41:43.893 --> 41:44.959
(chuckles)

41:47.080 --> 41:50.006
I turned in
my resignation today.

41:50.157 --> 41:53.401
They're giving me
full pension and benefits.

41:53.419 --> 41:56.721
Even gave me the name
of some fancy neurologist.

41:58.424 --> 42:00.016
What'd I tell you
about giving me

42:00.093 --> 42:02.519
that "poor you" look, Chavez?

42:02.595 --> 42:04.837
I'm sorry, it won't
happen again, sir.

42:04.856 --> 42:06.397
Better not.

42:07.767 --> 42:09.417
Listen...

42:09.419 --> 42:11.611
there's something
I want you to have.

42:19.262 --> 42:20.662
Your lucky webbing?

42:22.098 --> 42:23.373
But this is sacred, Cap.

42:23.600 --> 42:27.451
That's why you're
the only one I trust to keep it.

42:27.604 --> 42:30.547
As long as you're hanging on
to one end of it...

42:30.698 --> 42:33.883
it's a lucky firefighter
that's on the other end.

42:35.369 --> 42:40.539
Making you my lieutenant
was the best move I ever made.

42:40.559 --> 42:43.518
I'd say I'll always
remember you, kid, but...

42:45.288 --> 42:47.355
I'll remember
for the both of us.
