Can't think

08:33.930 --> 08:35.765
of a thing, Beck.

08:35.807 --> 08:37.476
Jess, I can't believe

08:35.807 --> 08:37.476
you never told anyone

08:37.517 --> 08:39.227

08:37.517 --> 08:39.227
graduate high school.

08:39.269 --> 08:40.979
Just didn't come up

08:39.269 --> 08:40.979
in conversation

08:41.021 --> 08:43.023
over the past 11 years.

08:43.064 --> 08:44.316
Oh, no, you don't.

08:44.358 --> 08:47.610
You are not getting away

08:44.358 --> 08:47.610
with that again.

08:47.652 --> 08:49.988
Honey, you and I

08:47.652 --> 08:49.988

08:50.030 --> 08:52.907
We tell each other

everything.

08:52.949 --> 08:55.076
Won't you please

08:52.949 --> 08:55.076
tell me what happened?

08:59.206 --> 09:00.374
I just..

09:00.415 --> 09:02.125
I'm embarrassed

09:00.415 --> 09:02.125
about this, it..

09:04.503 --> 09:06.546
It was my senior year.

09:06.587 --> 09:10.091
I don't know, I was just playing

09:06.587 --> 09:10.091
a lot of shows with my band

09:10.133 --> 09:12.719
I just got

09:10.133 --> 09:12.719
this new motorcycle..

09:12.760 --> 09:14.179
I don't know,

09:12.760 --> 09:14.179
it was just more fun

09:14.221 --> 09:17.265
than going to

09:14.221 --> 09:17.265
English class with Mr. Pearson.

09:17.307 --> 09:18.641
Used to start

09:17.307 --> 09:18.641
each class with

09:18.683 --> 09:22.062
"Read any good

09:18.683 --> 09:22.062

09:22.103 --> 09:23.230
- No.

- Yeah.

09:23.271 --> 09:25.690
- He said that?

09:23.271 --> 09:25.690
- Yeah.

09:25.732 --> 09:27.401
This guy

09:25.732 --> 09:27.401
was a killer and..

09:27.442 --> 09:29.569
You know, he made us memorize

09:27.442 --> 09:29.569
this poem

09:29.610 --> 09:31.612
"Oh, Captain, My Captain."

09:31.654 --> 09:32.947
And when I got up

09:31.654 --> 09:32.947
to recite it

09:32.989 --> 09:34.366
the guy

09:32.989 --> 09:34.366
just tore me to shreds

09:34.408 --> 09:36.993
because I, because I forgot

09:34.408 --> 09:36.993
a few words.

09:37.035 --> 09:38.619
How many words?

Everything after

09:38.661 --> 09:41.706
"Oh, captain, my captain."

09:41.748 --> 09:43.917
The point is, that he really

09:41.748 --> 09:43.917
made me look like an idiot

09:43.958 --> 09:46.169
and all the kids

09:43.958 --> 09:46.169
were laughing at me.

09:46.211 --> 09:48.171

09:46.211 --> 09:48.171
if I could go to the bathroom

09:51.216 --> 09:52.926
only missing one class.

09:52.967 --> 09:54.052
You could go back

09:52.967 --> 09:54.052

I could be cooler.

10:16.575 --> 10:18.201
of being a dropout.

10:18.243 --> 10:19.494
So drop back in.

14:30.203 --> 14:31.496
Wasn't it 10 years ago

14:31.538 --> 14:33.373
I gave you a pass

14:31.538 --> 14:33.373
to the bathroom?

14:34.833 --> 14:37.418
Yes. Yes, it was.

14:37.460 --> 14:38.878
Uh, they were out

14:37.460 --> 14:38.878
of toilet paper

14:38.919 --> 14:41.381
so I figured, what the heck,

14:38.919 --> 14:41.381
I'll quit school.

14:42.841 --> 14:45.968
I'm gonna,

14:42.841 --> 14:45.968
I'm gonna sit down now.

14:46.010 --> 14:48.304
You're starting this class

14:46.010 --> 14:48.304
a week after the others.

14:48.346 --> 14:50.097
I suggest you pay

14:48.346 --> 14:50.097
extra attention.

14:50.139 --> 14:52.517
Oh, no, no, no.

14:50.139 --> 14:52.517
Hey, I'm a new man, sir.

14:52.559 --> 14:55.311
No more screwin' off.

14:52.559 --> 14:55.311
I'm here to kick butt.

14:55.353 --> 14:58.481
I see your English

14:55.353 --> 14:58.481
is still as gentile and elegant

14:58.523 --> 15:00.567
as that of a Viking.

15:00.608 --> 15:02.151
Thank you, sir.

15:02.193 --> 15:05.988
Now, let's move on from the

15:02.193 --> 15:05.988
ridiculous to the sublime

15:06.030 --> 15:07.407
and continue our discussion

15:07.448 --> 15:09.701
of "The Red Badge Of Courage."

15:09.743 --> 15:13.621
"The Red Badge Of Coo-rege."

15:13.663 --> 15:18.209
Stephen Crane published

15:13.663 --> 15:18.209
this narrative in 1895.

15:18.251 --> 15:20.754
Excuse me, sir, now do we

15:18.251 --> 15:20.754
need to know dates for tests?

15:20.795 --> 15:23.172
There are no tests.

15:23.214 --> 15:25.675
Only examinations

15:23.214 --> 15:25.675
of a mind

15:25.717 --> 15:28.969
in the form of essays, and yes,

15:25.717 --> 15:28.969
you will need to know dates.

15:32.640 --> 15:35.226
Could've just said

15:32.640 --> 15:35.226
yes or no.

15:35.268 --> 15:37.144
Mr. Katsopolis,

15:35.268 --> 15:37.144
are you going to be

15:37.186 --> 15:39.063
a miscreant all your life?

15:40.815 --> 15:42.191
I don't know.

15:44.444 --> 15:47.864
Let's see,

15:44.444 --> 15:47.864
miscreant, miscreant.

15:47.906 --> 15:51.743
Miscreant.

15:47.906 --> 15:51.743
No, sir, no.

15:51.785 --> 15:54.746
I'm not going to be a

15:51.785 --> 15:54.746
troublemaker, a rabble-rouser

15:54.788 --> 15:57.415
ne'er-do-well, or knave.

15:57.457 --> 16:00.627
I don't know

15:57.457 --> 16:00.627
why you're here, Mr. Katsopolis.

16:00.668 --> 16:02.128
But, since

16:00.668 --> 16:02.128
you've presented me

16:02.169 --> 16:05.047
with the challenge

16:02.169 --> 16:05.047
of teaching you once again

16:05.089 --> 16:07.842
I suggest that you

16:05.089 --> 16:07.842
open your mind..

16:07.884 --> 16:10.511
...and shut your yap.

16:10.553 --> 16:13.640
In this class,

16:10.553 --> 16:13.640
you'll read four novels.

16:13.681 --> 16:15.308
You'll do

16:13.681 --> 16:15.308
an oral presentation

16:15.349 --> 16:17.727
as well as

16:15.349 --> 16:17.727
an in-depth analysis

16:17.769 --> 16:20.772
fifteen pages,

16:17.769 --> 16:20.772
single-spaced

16:20.814 --> 16:22.982
of your favorite

16:20.814 --> 16:22.982
American author..

16:23.023 --> 16:24.901
...should you know one.

16:26.903 --> 16:29.489
For your information, sir,

16:26.903 --> 16:29.489
I do know one.

16:29.530 --> 16:31.825
Ladies and gentlemen,

16:29.530 --> 16:31.825
Mr. Walter Whitman.

16:31.866 --> 16:33.827
I'd like to do a poem

16:31.866 --> 16:33.827
right now if I may.

16:33.868 --> 16:36.913
It goes something

16:33.868 --> 16:36.913
like this. Ahem.

16:36.955 --> 16:39.999
Oh, captain, my captain

16:40.040 --> 16:42.794
our fearful trip is done.

16:42.836 --> 16:44.629
The ship has weathered

16:42.836 --> 16:44.629
every rack

16:46.380 --> 16:49.425
the prize we sought is won.

16:49.467 --> 16:52.679
I am impressed,

16:49.467 --> 16:52.679
Mr. Katsopolis.

16:53.763 --> 16:56.891
Why, thank you,

16:53.763 --> 16:56.891
Mr. Pearson.

16:56.933 --> 16:59.727
Would you mind, tell

16:56.933 --> 16:59.727
the class what it means?

17:03.105 --> 17:05.984
Okay.

17:03.105 --> 17:05.984
Okay, I'll tell you.

17:06.025 --> 17:08.862
Uh, it's about this,

17:06.025 --> 17:08.862
um, this captain

17:08.903 --> 17:10.905
and about his fearful trip

17:10.947 --> 17:12.657
and it was done,

17:10.947 --> 17:12.657
it was finished.

17:12.699 --> 17:15.284
And they got

17:12.699 --> 17:15.284
out of the rack

17:15.326 --> 17:17.912
and they won a prize,

17:15.326 --> 17:17.912
they all won prizes.

17:17.954 --> 17:22.082
Actually, Mr. Katsopolis, this

17:17.954 --> 17:22.082
poem is about Abraham Lincoln.

17:22.124 --> 17:25.044
No, why didn't they call it

17:22.124 --> 17:25.044
Oh, Lincoln, My Lincoln?

17:26.462 --> 17:29.716
I suggest you sit down,

17:26.462 --> 17:29.716
Mr. Katsopolis

17:29.757 --> 17:33.427
very slowly,

17:29.757 --> 17:33.427
so you won't injure your brain.

17:34.136 --> 17:35.262
[laughing]

17:38.850 --> 17:40.810
[dramatic music]

17:40.852 --> 17:43.062
Sir, you mind if I

17:40.852 --> 17:43.062
go to the bathroom?

17:43.103 --> 17:45.105
It's right

17:43.103 --> 17:45.105
where you left it.

17:51.988 --> 17:53.531
See you in ten years.

17:56.283 --> 17:57.410
Hi, daddy.

17:57.451 --> 18:00.454
Hey, sweetheart.

17:57.451 --> 18:00.454
Come here.

18:00.496 --> 18:02.040
How's your shoe tying

18:00.496 --> 18:02.040
coming along?

18:02.081 --> 18:03.666
Piece of cake.

18:03.708 --> 18:06.168
What the heck is that glob

18:03.708 --> 18:06.168
of pink stuff on your shoe?

18:06.210 --> 18:07.879
Piece of bubble gum.

18:10.297 --> 18:13.676
Sweetheart, why'd you tie

18:10.297 --> 18:13.676
your shoe with bubble gum?

18:13.718 --> 18:15.511
The Play-Doh

18:13.718 --> 18:15.511
didn't stick.

18:16.888 --> 18:18.932
Michelle, I know how hard

18:16.888 --> 18:18.932
you've been trying

18:18.973 --> 18:20.140
to learn how to

18:18.973 --> 18:20.140
ties your shoe

18:20.182 --> 18:22.518
but, bubble gum

18:20.182 --> 18:22.518
can get pretty messy.

18:22.560 --> 18:24.103
I'll keep trying.

18:24.144 --> 18:26.647
Where's the stapler?

18:26.689 --> 18:28.190
Forget about

18:26.689 --> 18:28.190
the stapler.

18:28.232 --> 18:29.483
The only way you're gonna learn

18:28.232 --> 18:29.483
how to tie your shoe

18:29.525 --> 18:31.069
is just to keep practicing.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.946
Okay.

18:32.987 --> 18:36.032
Practice,

18:32.987 --> 18:36.032
practice, practice.

18:36.074 --> 18:37.575
I think mine

18:36.074 --> 18:37.575
will be better.

18:37.617 --> 18:39.410
Hey, could you guys

18:37.617 --> 18:39.410
help us out please?

18:39.452 --> 18:41.037
These two

18:39.452 --> 18:41.037
can't decide on a slogan.

18:41.079 --> 18:43.414
They're arguing so much,

18:41.079 --> 18:43.414
I can't hear myself chew.

18:45.083 --> 18:46.918
Why don't we

18:45.083 --> 18:46.918
put it to a vote?

18:46.960 --> 18:48.669
And please, be fair.

18:48.711 --> 18:52.924
Don't let me

18:48.711 --> 18:52.924
influence you in any way.

18:52.966 --> 18:55.134
You can't

18:52.966 --> 18:55.134
buy my vote

18:55.175 --> 18:57.386
but you can rent it

18:55.175 --> 18:57.386
for an hour.

18:58.554 --> 19:00.932
Okay, here's my slogan.

19:00.974 --> 19:03.768
People who are smart

19:00.974 --> 19:03.768
finish what they start.

19:03.810 --> 19:05.103
Stay in school.

19:05.144 --> 19:06.896
- It's very good, Deej.

19:05.144 --> 19:06.896
- Yeah.

19:06.938 --> 19:10.316
And now the second choice,

19:06.938 --> 19:10.316
the only choice.

19:10.357 --> 19:12.526
Stay in school.

19:10.357 --> 19:12.526
Don't be an idiot.

19:12.568 --> 19:14.236
Don't drop out

19:12.568 --> 19:14.236
even if you have to

19:14.278 --> 19:16.155
glue your butt to a chair.

19:21.452 --> 19:22.536
Catchy.

19:24.038 --> 19:25.247
Okay, it's voting time.

19:25.289 --> 19:26.666
What do you think?

19:26.707 --> 19:28.709
- D.J.

19:26.707 --> 19:28.709
- Deej.

19:28.751 --> 19:31.420
- D.J.

19:31.462 --> 19:32.546
Kimmy.

19:32.588 --> 19:34.048
- Steve.

19:32.588 --> 19:34.048
- What?

19:34.090 --> 19:36.467
I like that gluing

19:34.090 --> 19:36.467
your butt part.

19:38.344 --> 19:39.887
Hey, sweetheart,

19:38.344 --> 19:39.887
you're back early.

19:39.929 --> 19:41.347
- How did it go?

19:39.929 --> 19:41.347
- Here.

19:41.388 --> 19:43.850
Give these to Nicky and Alex,

19:41.388 --> 19:43.850
they can color them.

19:43.891 --> 19:45.267
I'm guessing,

19:43.891 --> 19:45.267
it didn't go very well?

19:45.309 --> 19:46.560
You guessed right.

19:46.602 --> 19:48.187
What about the campaign?

19:48.228 --> 19:51.149
You better find yourself another

19:48.228 --> 19:51.149
stay-in-school poster boy.

19:51.190 --> 19:52.441
I quit.

20:07.498 --> 20:08.749
What's goin' on, munchkin.

20:08.791 --> 20:09.876
You're throwing out

20:08.791 --> 20:09.876
all your shoes?

20:09.917 --> 20:12.045
Only the ones

20:09.917 --> 20:12.045
with the laces.

20:12.086 --> 20:14.505
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:12.086 --> 20:14.505
Hold it. Hold it.

20:14.547 --> 20:16.049
Now, come here.

20:18.051 --> 20:19.593
I know you're, uh

20:19.635 --> 20:21.387
having a little trouble

20:19.635 --> 20:21.387
with the shoe tying thing

20:21.428 --> 20:23.848
but, don't you think

20:21.428 --> 20:23.848
you're bein' a little hasty?

20:23.890 --> 20:26.308
No, 'cause I don't know

20:23.890 --> 20:26.308
what hasty means.

20:28.144 --> 20:30.063
That mean, you gotta

20:28.144 --> 20:30.063
think things out first.

20:30.104 --> 20:31.438
I mean, if you throw out

20:30.104 --> 20:31.438
all your shoes

20:31.480 --> 20:32.899
what are you gonna

20:31.480 --> 20:32.899
wear on your feet?

20:32.940 --> 20:36.110
Sandals, slippers,

20:32.940 --> 20:36.110
anything with Velcro.

20:38.278 --> 20:40.322
Oh, Michelle, you don't wanna be

20:38.278 --> 20:40.322
a quitter.

20:40.364 --> 20:41.657
You don't feel

20:40.364 --> 20:41.657
good about yourself.

20:41.699 --> 20:43.242
I mean, quitting

20:41.699 --> 20:43.242
is for losers.

20:43.283 --> 20:44.660
Don't wanna

20:43.283 --> 20:44.660
let yourself down

20:44.702 --> 20:46.871
and all the people

20:44.702 --> 20:46.871
who care about you.

20:47.496 --> 20:49.040
[dramatic music]

20:49.082 --> 20:50.208
Everything

20:49.082 --> 20:50.208
I'm saying to you

20:50.249 --> 20:52.210
I should be saying

20:50.249 --> 20:52.210
to myself.

20:54.962 --> 20:57.006
[sighs]

20:57.965 --> 21:01.094
Old buddy, I, uh..

21:01.135 --> 21:02.553
Quit school tonight.

21:02.595 --> 21:03.721
Again?

21:05.014 --> 21:06.974
Yes, again.

21:07.016 --> 21:09.435
What did you do that for?

21:09.476 --> 21:11.437
Well, school just turned out be

21:09.476 --> 21:11.437
a lot harder than I thought

21:11.478 --> 21:14.398
just like tying your shoes was

21:11.478 --> 21:14.398
harder than you thought.

21:14.440 --> 21:16.275
Tell me about it.

21:18.069 --> 21:20.821
If you can quit, I can quit.

21:20.863 --> 21:22.073
Come on, Michelle,

21:20.863 --> 21:22.073
don't you wanna learn

21:22.115 --> 21:23.157
how to tie your shoes?

21:23.199 --> 21:25.325
Don't you wanna finish school?

21:27.828 --> 21:29.538
Yes, I do.

21:30.664 --> 21:31.874
I tell you what

21:31.916 --> 21:33.375
let's make a deal, huh?

21:33.417 --> 21:36.045
Okay, it's a deal.

21:36.087 --> 21:37.630
I haven't even told you

21:36.087 --> 21:37.630
the deal yet.

21:39.590 --> 21:42.342
Alright, this is the deal,

21:39.590 --> 21:42.342
I'll go back to night school

21:42.384 --> 21:44.595
if you learn

21:42.384 --> 21:44.595
how to tie your shoes.

21:44.637 --> 21:46.597
'Cause in the end, we'll feel

21:44.637 --> 21:46.597
really good about ourselves

21:46.639 --> 21:48.808
'cause we worked so hard.

21:48.849 --> 21:50.350
What do you say?

21:50.392 --> 21:52.352
Okay, is it a deal now?

21:52.394 --> 21:53.687
Now it's a deal.

21:53.729 --> 21:55.606
