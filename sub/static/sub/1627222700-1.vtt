00:10.768 --> 00:13.935
(intense synth music)

00:21.566 --> 00:24.316
(haunting music)

01:10.288 --> 01:11.788
(explosion booms)

01:11.788 --> 01:14.205
(man groans)

01:15.075 --> 01:15.988
- Hey!

01:15.988 --> 01:16.821
Come on!

01:18.883 --> 01:20.423
I need you right here.

01:26.150 --> 01:26.983
Okay.

01:31.100 --> 01:32.633
We're gonna storm that bunker.

01:41.872 --> 01:45.539
If you move fast enough,
they won't see you.

01:47.827 --> 01:50.994
(intense synth music)

01:55.477 --> 01:56.890
Go!

01:56.890 --> 01:59.390
(guns firing)

02:01.629 --> 02:04.796
(intense synth music)

02:54.341 --> 02:55.297
- I'm out.

02:55.297 --> 02:56.630
I'm out of ammo!

03:00.310 --> 03:02.810
(guns firing)

03:04.196 --> 03:06.696
(tense music)

04:52.750 --> 04:56.700
When the armies of Victoria and Seattle

04:56.700 --> 04:58.493
attacked our western borders,

04:59.600 --> 05:01.743
we fought together on the front lines.

05:04.120 --> 05:06.650
Wave after wave of infantry

05:06.650 --> 05:08.863
smashed their way through our defenses.

05:09.840 --> 05:13.303
The Sons kept in constant formation,

05:14.180 --> 05:16.460
sweeping the streets,

05:16.460 --> 05:19.043
burning and grinding the gears of war.

05:22.340 --> 05:24.423
When our squad was hit by an ambush,

05:25.890 --> 05:30.273
he gained rank and became a guiding force.

05:31.660 --> 05:34.563
We dug in, put our faith in him.

05:36.180 --> 05:39.973
For days they rained down
small arms and firebombs.

05:41.890 --> 05:44.743
But because of him, we made it through.

05:46.770 --> 05:49.370
But not without consequence.

05:49.370 --> 05:51.683
He was captured and tortured.

05:53.790 --> 05:57.633
By the time we found him,
he was never the same.

05:59.909 --> 06:02.593
War had changed him.

06:04.100 --> 06:07.903
I didn't see the madness
building in his eyes,

06:09.190 --> 06:10.243
or the hate.

06:12.290 --> 06:14.543
When I look back now, I can see it.

06:18.120 --> 06:22.582
Sergeant Merle Ramses of
the Intercontinental Army.

06:24.820 --> 06:26.003
He was my brother.

06:27.644 --> 06:30.590
Him and his men left me with nothing

06:31.640 --> 06:35.363
but a set of footprints
leading into the wastes.

06:36.770 --> 06:41.183
I'd say he has at least 30
men with him, maybe more.

06:42.480 --> 06:43.693
While I was in the army,

06:45.323 --> 06:48.803
I heard rumors of a
massive radiation signature

06:49.790 --> 06:51.243
coming from way out deep.

06:52.440 --> 06:54.397
He was always consumed with the idea

06:56.054 --> 06:57.654
of some kind of hydrogen weapon.

06:59.340 --> 07:02.523
However, by the sources I've seen,

07:04.060 --> 07:06.733
it could be something much more powerful.

07:16.369 --> 07:19.619
(dramatic synth music)

07:39.113 --> 07:41.780
(woman screams)

08:21.091 --> 08:24.341
This looks like the work of my brother.

08:25.288 --> 08:28.038
I'm getting close, I can feel it.

08:32.142 --> 08:35.392
(dramatic synth music)

09:47.043 --> 09:50.293
(man breathes heavily)

09:57.093 --> 09:59.753
(owl hoots)

09:59.753 --> 10:02.253
(tense music)

10:08.879 --> 10:11.212
(gun fires)

10:18.763 --> 10:20.780
Where's Ramses?

10:20.780 --> 10:22.073
- Ramses over there.

10:22.910 --> 10:23.873
Ramses dead.

10:26.730 --> 10:28.313
- Now I'm sure you've noticed,

10:31.090 --> 10:33.728
I'm not a man to play games.

10:33.728 --> 10:35.187
You wouldn't like that.

10:35.187 --> 10:37.753
(man groans)

10:37.753 --> 10:39.003
I won't kill you quickly.

10:40.020 --> 10:41.776
You wouldn't like that.

10:41.776 --> 10:42.690
(man coughs)

10:42.690 --> 10:44.163
It's gonna fester,

10:47.240 --> 10:49.533
take a couple days to work through you.

10:55.330 --> 10:57.130
Chances are it'll call the carrions,

10:58.440 --> 11:03.440
or you can lay out here
and cook in the sun.

11:10.400 --> 11:14.943
Your best bet is to tell
me where my brother is,

11:16.345 --> 11:19.360
and I'll see about making a
quicker road to hell for you.

11:22.140 --> 11:23.340
- I don't know.

11:24.679 --> 11:26.383
He went into the desert.

11:29.460 --> 11:33.533
I heard stories if you go
that way, you don't come back.

11:40.130 --> 11:43.183
Now kill me, you son of a bitch.

11:43.183 --> 11:44.016
(man spits)

11:44.016 --> 11:44.849
Kill me!

11:48.492 --> 11:49.820
- If you don't have any objections with me

11:49.820 --> 11:51.773
taking a look at that kid over there,

11:55.084 --> 11:57.890
I don't think you'll
be needing it with you.

11:57.890 --> 11:58.850
Die, law.

12:04.030 --> 12:04.963
- You're one man.

12:07.240 --> 12:08.593
He's got a fuckin' army.

12:10.800 --> 12:12.123
You don't stand a chance.

12:13.078 --> 12:15.495
(man coughs)

12:19.239 --> 12:21.572
You know that wife of yours?

12:26.024 --> 12:28.607
(glass breaks)

12:30.700 --> 12:31.533
She begged me.

12:34.140 --> 12:35.240
She begged me to stop.

12:40.470 --> 12:44.643
She said your name, I
don't know how many times.

12:46.644 --> 12:49.311
(intense music)

13:29.070 --> 13:31.737
(ominous music)

13:42.730 --> 13:43.563
- [Travis] I wonder what the hell

13:43.563 --> 13:44.883
could bring them out this far.

13:47.256 --> 13:49.023
I can't say I care much what it is.

13:50.790 --> 13:53.240
But the plot points on this map

13:53.240 --> 13:55.083
leads straight into no man's land,

13:56.150 --> 13:57.583
deep into the waste.

13:59.000 --> 14:02.910
Hundreds of miles of nothing
but heartache and desperation.

14:02.910 --> 14:05.713
To lead his men into
that kind of wilderness,

14:07.280 --> 14:09.163
he must want it bad.

14:09.163 --> 14:11.496
(gun fires)

14:21.367 --> 14:24.034
(intense music)

14:25.967 --> 14:28.467
(guns firing)

15:27.310 --> 15:28.560
There's too many of them.

15:30.020 --> 15:30.970
We need to retreat.

15:38.453 --> 15:40.530
- I don't know.

15:40.530 --> 15:42.923
- I've got a family, a wife.

15:44.140 --> 15:45.123
Let's fall back.

15:51.113 --> 15:51.946
Merle!

15:55.623 --> 15:57.956
(gun fires)

16:01.452 --> 16:04.119
(intense music)

16:23.260 --> 16:28.260
- The great fire painted
the skies a crimson shade

16:30.260 --> 16:32.483
leaving charred remains at my feet.

16:37.010 --> 16:40.723
I realized this nation was doomed to fail,

16:42.060 --> 16:43.163
but I kept fighting.

16:44.810 --> 16:48.813
We had sworn an oath to
the Intercontinental Army.

16:52.150 --> 16:57.150
Then news came, the Sons were
moving towards my hometown,

16:59.400 --> 17:02.673
sweeping and murdering a few cities away.

17:04.750 --> 17:06.123
I had no choice.

17:08.660 --> 17:12.723
I had to desert the army and find my wife.

17:19.720 --> 17:22.542
My brother didn't see it that way.

17:25.170 --> 17:27.772
His eyes were on fire when I left.

17:29.690 --> 17:31.303
I begged him to come with me,

17:33.310 --> 17:34.758
and he called me a coward.

17:34.758 --> 17:36.800
We're out here alone, we gotta go!

17:36.800 --> 17:38.833
I told him if he changed his mind,

17:40.130 --> 17:41.563
he knew where to find me.

17:44.150 --> 17:47.293
He said nothing, and watched me go.

17:49.360 --> 17:51.583
By the time I broke
free from the maelstrom,

17:53.360 --> 17:55.013
most of our platoon was dead,

17:57.510 --> 17:59.703
and our army was crumbling.

18:02.520 --> 18:04.293
After years had gone by,

18:06.669 --> 18:08.393
I thought I had lost my brother.

18:10.440 --> 18:14.400
Another casualty to a war
that changed the world.

18:15.717 --> 18:19.073
And that became the seeds for his revenge.

18:20.850 --> 18:22.683
I paid a terrible price.

18:24.663 --> 18:27.330
(ominous music)

20:12.448 --> 20:15.781
(man speaking on radio)

20:30.170 --> 20:35.003
(man yells)
(guns firing)

20:44.607 --> 20:47.274
(intense music)

21:14.453 --> 21:16.786
(man yells)

21:19.693 --> 21:22.026
(gun fires)

21:33.780 --> 21:36.363
(Travis yells)

22:00.227 --> 22:02.644
(man groans)

22:09.460 --> 22:11.903
These cannibals, wild men.

22:12.790 --> 22:14.893
Growing up after the fires of war.

22:16.230 --> 22:18.730
No sense of decency left,

22:18.730 --> 22:20.873
just scavengers of an old world.

22:23.310 --> 22:26.707
The chances of me walking
out of this just plummeted.

22:37.192 --> 22:40.192
(melancholic music)

22:44.955 --> 22:48.406
(Hannah laughs)

22:48.406 --> 22:51.116
(glass breaks)

22:51.116 --> 22:53.314
(gun fires)

22:53.314 --> 22:56.064
(haunting music)

23:23.587 --> 23:25.703
I went searching for my wife.

23:27.870 --> 23:30.583
War had left nothing but
death and ash in its wake.

23:33.470 --> 23:38.470
I knew that there is a slim
chance I would find her alive.

23:43.082 --> 23:46.290
And I had made a promise
to Hannah years prior.

23:48.150 --> 23:52.283
If she was still alive, I
knew where she would be.

23:54.828 --> 23:56.553
- [Hannah] Travis?

23:56.553 --> 24:01.344
- When I found her, I held her so tight.

24:01.344 --> 24:04.007
I wish that moment could last forever.

24:07.260 --> 24:08.813
Out of all the destruction,

24:09.660 --> 24:10.860
I had her to hold on to.

24:12.148 --> 24:14.743
I could see all the loss
Hannah had been through.

24:16.273 --> 24:19.413
The death of so many
people that she had loved.

24:20.583 --> 24:23.860
I told her about my father's cabin,

24:23.860 --> 24:25.463
how we could start a new life.

24:28.175 --> 24:31.367
I saw the hope once
again return to her eyes.

24:33.935 --> 24:36.518
(crows cawing)

24:38.531 --> 24:41.781
(dramatic synth music)

25:11.070 --> 25:12.480
All right.

25:12.480 --> 25:13.493
I'm backing up.

25:16.470 --> 25:19.380
- Yeah, keep backing up
and throw them guns down.

25:19.380 --> 25:20.280
- I can't do that.

25:21.391 --> 25:23.630
Not while you have that
shooter pointed at me.

25:23.630 --> 25:25.063
- Why are you following us?

25:26.407 --> 25:27.730
- "Us"?

25:27.730 --> 25:28.627
Who else is out here with you?

25:28.627 --> 25:31.000
- Me and the cat, smart guy.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.240
Why are you following us?

25:33.240 --> 25:35.130
- To tell you the truth,

25:35.130 --> 25:36.830
I didn't know who I was following.

25:38.380 --> 25:40.180
You dragging around that cat carrier

25:41.020 --> 25:43.130
makes a mighty strange track.

25:43.130 --> 25:44.190
I didn't know what I'd find.

25:44.190 --> 25:45.940
- I think I'm just gonna shoot you.

25:45.940 --> 25:47.190
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

25:49.300 --> 25:50.433
All right, look.

25:51.881 --> 25:53.131
The way I got it figured,

25:54.060 --> 25:56.963
is you got me dead before
I raise my barrel up.

25:58.009 --> 26:00.860
But you'll also notice
I also have my shooter

26:00.860 --> 26:03.190
pointed right at Mr. Kitty over there.

26:03.190 --> 26:04.623
- Stay away from that cat!

26:08.150 --> 26:09.500
- Now, I'll be backing off.

26:10.890 --> 26:13.110
I was just curious, is all.

26:13.110 --> 26:15.160
I haven't seen very many people out here.

26:17.216 --> 26:20.123
I don't suppose you tell
me who the hell you are

26:22.460 --> 26:24.410
and how you've been surviving out here?

26:27.150 --> 26:28.113
I didn't think so.

26:29.100 --> 26:30.163
I'll be on my way.

26:32.510 --> 26:35.103
I'll leave your gun up
on the top of the hill.

26:38.090 --> 26:39.263
- You're just leaving?

26:40.560 --> 26:41.513
- Yup.

26:42.500 --> 26:44.390
- [Cat Lady] Where are you going?

26:44.390 --> 26:48.603
- I'm looking for someone,
and you're not them.

26:49.470 --> 26:51.100
So I'll be on my way.

26:51.100 --> 26:52.600
- I'm looking for someone too.

26:54.290 --> 26:58.083
My sister, she disappeared
a couple days ago.

26:59.530 --> 27:00.763
There's a town up north,

27:01.930 --> 27:04.950
maybe the someone you're
looking for is there too.

27:04.950 --> 27:06.100
- That town isn't safe.

27:07.530 --> 27:09.780
They'll gut you and not
think twice about it.

27:11.870 --> 27:13.547
You'd be wise to steer
clear of that hellhole.

27:13.547 --> 27:15.083
- But what about my sister?

27:17.320 --> 27:18.930
- What does she look like?

27:18.930 --> 27:21.173
- Really pretty with blond hair.

27:23.440 --> 27:24.363
I have a photo.

27:33.310 --> 27:35.983
- I did see someone like
this a couple days back.

27:38.500 --> 27:40.750
There was nothing I
could do for them though.

27:41.788 --> 27:42.938
They were already dead.

27:46.070 --> 27:47.600
- Are you just saying that

27:47.600 --> 27:48.993
to get a rise out of me?

27:51.969 --> 27:53.052
- Afraid not.

27:55.149 --> 27:56.732
Her throat was cut.

27:58.640 --> 28:00.763
Looked like it was a
mercy when it happened.

28:02.870 --> 28:03.703
I'm sorry.

28:18.670 --> 28:20.990
She was as out of place

28:20.990 --> 28:23.183
as the tracks she was leaving in the sand.

28:25.230 --> 28:27.630
It would've been a mercy
to put a bullet in her,

28:29.000 --> 28:31.223
save her from the agony that lies ahead.

28:33.860 --> 28:35.663
Her supplies might have been useful,

28:37.450 --> 28:38.663
or a waste of a bullet.

28:40.120 --> 28:44.340
Anyone dumb enough to
aimlessly wander the desert

28:44.340 --> 28:45.963
will surely pay the price.

28:48.520 --> 28:52.160
It's a wonder that she's lasted this long.

28:53.342 --> 28:56.092
(dramatic music)

29:34.893 --> 29:37.773
When my mind drifts like worried fire,

29:39.270 --> 29:41.223
I always go back to that place.

29:42.520 --> 29:43.673
It comforts me.

29:44.740 --> 29:48.220
My chair, my favorite coffee mug,

29:48.220 --> 29:50.420
the way that picture would sit crooked

29:50.420 --> 29:52.338
on the way to our bed.

29:52.338 --> 29:54.110
The sound of the pine trees

29:54.110 --> 29:55.633
that would sway in the breeze.

29:57.432 --> 29:58.800
(Hannah chuckles)

29:58.800 --> 30:01.210
I memorized that place.

30:01.210 --> 30:02.213
Every inch of it.

30:04.494 --> 30:06.960
I walked those steps in my mind

30:06.960 --> 30:09.213
over and over again.

30:11.350 --> 30:14.813
That lovely island of isolation
high in the mountains.

30:16.190 --> 30:18.143
Where we made a life for ourselves.

30:19.430 --> 30:21.633
One filled with love and hope.

30:23.040 --> 30:24.283
Five years passed.

30:26.350 --> 30:28.363
My wife gave birth to our son.

30:31.250 --> 30:33.483
After all this world had shown me,

30:35.530 --> 30:38.766
I knew I had found my way home.

30:38.766 --> 30:41.433
(hopeful music)

30:47.505 --> 30:50.005
(guns firing)

30:55.929 --> 30:58.512
(Hannah yells)

31:02.134 --> 31:03.217
I'm so sorry.

31:06.435 --> 31:07.711
(glass breaks)

31:07.711 --> 31:10.716
(Travis yells)

31:10.716 --> 31:12.371
(baby cries)

31:12.371 --> 31:14.704
(gun fires)

31:15.971 --> 31:18.554
(Travis yells)

31:20.316 --> 31:23.233
(mysterious music)

31:33.612 --> 31:34.445
No, no!

31:36.351 --> 31:38.851
(tense music)

32:27.334 --> 32:31.803
I'd give anything to kill
the pain in this arm.

32:32.723 --> 32:36.433
A shot of whisky, a mercy bullet.

32:38.295 --> 32:40.212
The fever's setting in.

32:41.590 --> 32:42.773
I'd lost the trail,

32:45.110 --> 32:47.580
and I'm not sure if I'm anywhere close

32:47.580 --> 32:49.080
to the coordinates on the map.

32:51.940 --> 32:53.570
Lost in the desert.

32:55.705 --> 32:57.649
I can't focus.

32:57.649 --> 32:59.949
I've been seeing double
for the last two days.

33:00.823 --> 33:05.010
And I'm just guessing at this point.

33:07.913 --> 33:11.280
A compass is all that separates me

33:11.280 --> 33:13.483
from being buried out here in the sand.

33:15.917 --> 33:17.803
And it's no longer pointing north.

33:22.012 --> 33:24.720
The pain shoots through
my body with each step.

33:25.942 --> 33:30.280
A shriveled nose, cracked
eyes meet with blood,

33:30.280 --> 33:31.893
face down in the dirt.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.937
This is what lies ahead.

33:36.867 --> 33:38.960
It won't be long now.

33:38.960 --> 33:41.710
(dramatic music)

34:17.786 --> 34:22.703
(gun fires)
(glass breaks)

34:39.735 --> 34:40.735
I thought...

34:43.429 --> 34:45.683
We gave up on following each other.

34:52.947 --> 34:56.201
I could just shoot you right now

34:56.201 --> 34:57.483
and get it over with.

34:58.882 --> 35:00.213
- What happened to you?

35:01.097 --> 35:02.233
Are you sick?

35:05.203 --> 35:06.803
(Travis grunts)

35:06.803 --> 35:07.636
- Okay.

35:13.500 --> 35:16.293
- That wound on your arm is infected.

35:17.910 --> 35:19.610
You should really let me help you.

35:24.200 --> 35:26.620
I'm sure you know what this is.

35:26.620 --> 35:28.793
I'll help you under one condition.

35:30.500 --> 35:32.470
You give me some of what
you were eating last night,

35:32.470 --> 35:33.883
it smelled pretty good.

35:38.684 --> 35:42.101
- It's scrawny, but it'll fill the belly.

35:44.881 --> 35:45.903
You build the fire.

35:54.818 --> 35:56.318
Thank you, Hannah.

36:12.710 --> 36:16.493
Let's start by heading towards
those mountains over there.

36:19.010 --> 36:20.673
Go until you find the river,

36:21.610 --> 36:23.110
and then follow it downstream.

36:25.480 --> 36:26.980
- Why would I want to do that?

36:28.413 --> 36:30.583
- Because you're bound to find somebody.

36:31.610 --> 36:33.013
- I already found someone.

36:36.251 --> 36:39.501
(dramatic synth music)

37:06.141 --> 37:08.569
- What are you doing here?

37:08.569 --> 37:10.019
- I decided to come this way.

37:11.560 --> 37:12.733
- I'm going this way.

37:22.550 --> 37:24.400
- Purely coincidence we're both here.

37:25.750 --> 37:26.583
- Is that so?

37:29.073 --> 37:32.323
(dramatic synth music)

38:01.534 --> 38:02.367
Hold up.

38:03.970 --> 38:05.553
Don't come up here.

38:18.689 --> 38:19.689
- Oh my God.

38:21.892 --> 38:23.059
What happened?

38:24.248 --> 38:25.748
- I'm not certain.

38:27.127 --> 38:29.450
But this certainly looks
like the work of men

38:30.465 --> 38:31.865
that I'm aiming to run into.

38:33.750 --> 38:35.820
- What do you want with such people?

38:37.844 --> 38:42.844
(guns firing)
(intense music)

38:44.289 --> 38:45.882
- It's a trap!

38:45.882 --> 38:48.000
(gun fires)

38:48.000 --> 38:48.833
Go, go!

38:51.021 --> 38:53.354
(gun fires)

39:05.845 --> 39:07.501
I can't do it.

39:07.501 --> 39:08.445
- What?

39:08.445 --> 39:09.362
What is it?

39:11.837 --> 39:16.067
- When I say, you shoot that gun of yours.

39:16.067 --> 39:17.763
You got me?

39:17.763 --> 39:18.599
You got me?

39:18.599 --> 39:20.153
- Yeah, yeah.

39:20.153 --> 39:21.736
- Switch positions.

39:24.849 --> 39:26.449
Get over me, now.

39:26.449 --> 39:29.283
(gun fires)

39:29.283 --> 39:31.777
Get your gun loaded.

39:31.777 --> 39:34.277
(tense music)

39:36.397 --> 39:37.230
Now, go!

39:38.433 --> 39:40.726
(gun fires)

39:40.726 --> 39:42.276
I'm gonna go up the front.

39:42.276 --> 39:43.763
You go that way and flank them.

39:43.763 --> 39:44.682
You got me?

39:44.682 --> 39:45.515
- Yeah.

39:45.515 --> 39:46.598
- Go, go, go!

39:54.490 --> 39:55.323
It's clear.

39:58.870 --> 39:59.770
- Where'd they go?

40:08.170 --> 40:09.020
- There's no one.

40:11.252 --> 40:12.213
No one for miles.

40:15.588 --> 40:16.670
- I thought you shot one of them,

40:16.670 --> 40:17.683
where's the body?

40:21.030 --> 40:23.023
- It's a good question.

40:24.610 --> 40:27.973
No shells, no tracks.

40:30.960 --> 40:32.173
They just disappeared.

40:35.790 --> 40:37.033
Doesn't make any sense.

40:39.030 --> 40:41.130
I've heard of seeing ghosts in the desert,

40:42.520 --> 40:45.437
but those bullets, they were real enough.

40:46.657 --> 40:49.407
(dramatic music)

40:55.580 --> 40:57.950
I got comfortable with the idea

40:57.950 --> 41:00.483
spending the rest of
my days at that cabin.

41:02.090 --> 41:03.883
Thought I could leave this world behind.

41:08.406 --> 41:11.573
I didn't see it then, how wrong I was.

41:13.440 --> 41:16.193
I always told her it was going to be okay.

41:18.098 --> 41:19.098
I was lying.

41:21.435 --> 41:22.352
To us both.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.670
I didn't want any of the
nightmares in this world

41:27.670 --> 41:28.603
to touch her.

41:31.320 --> 41:32.953
I thought we had found home.

41:38.730 --> 41:42.903
In the end, I was wrong.

41:48.570 --> 41:49.570
- What was she like?

41:54.450 --> 41:57.373
That's who you're thinking
about, I can tell.

42:00.470 --> 42:01.303
- She was kind.

42:06.040 --> 42:08.080
Would've done anything for you.

42:12.198 --> 42:14.140
- My sister would do that too.

42:14.140 --> 42:14.973
Drift away.

42:17.640 --> 42:19.440
She'd dance around the room

42:19.440 --> 42:21.823
and dream of these far away places.

42:23.230 --> 42:25.833
The beach, the hot sun on her skin.

42:26.748 --> 42:29.983
Or a fancy restaurant with
gourmet food on the plates.

42:33.004 --> 42:35.467
I called them warm places in her mind.

42:38.220 --> 42:39.677
She started to look for those places,

42:39.677 --> 42:43.863
and it got the best of her.

42:46.090 --> 42:47.323
- Sorry for your loss.

42:55.020 --> 42:57.607
- What your brother did
to you was horrible.

43:00.090 --> 43:01.063
You're a good man.

43:02.310 --> 43:03.383
You can't just-

43:03.383 --> 43:04.300
- Negative.

43:05.603 --> 43:07.103
With all due respect, darling,

43:08.650 --> 43:11.033
you don't know what you're talking about.

43:12.780 --> 43:14.387
Or how good I am or not.

43:22.260 --> 43:23.360
- Why are we stopping?

43:24.440 --> 43:25.440
- Get your ass down.

43:39.731 --> 43:42.455
(gun fires)

43:42.455 --> 43:45.790
- Jesus, who are you shooting at?

43:45.790 --> 43:46.623
- Damn it.

43:47.517 --> 43:48.350
- What?

43:48.350 --> 43:49.300
- I just winged him.

43:49.300 --> 43:50.200
Come on, let's go.

43:51.590 --> 43:52.500
- Who are you shooting at?

43:52.500 --> 43:54.730
- Move it, come on!

43:54.730 --> 43:55.803
- He's over here.

43:58.580 --> 44:00.180
Looks like he's hurt pretty bad.

44:01.864 --> 44:04.690
- Then his troubles will
be over soon enough.

44:04.690 --> 44:07.085
You may want to look
the other way, darling.

44:07.085 --> 44:08.900
- You can't shoot him.

44:08.900 --> 44:09.830
- Why not?

44:09.830 --> 44:11.730
- [Cat Lady] Because he's defenseless!

44:12.790 --> 44:14.890
- That isn't any kind of excuse.

44:14.890 --> 44:15.870
He has his coming.

44:15.870 --> 44:19.320
- You know, he might be
more help to you alive.

44:19.320 --> 44:21.890
You said you were looking
for all the soldiers, right?

44:21.890 --> 44:24.680
Well, he might be able to
tell you where they are,

44:24.680 --> 44:26.380
but he can't do that if he's dead.

44:30.890 --> 44:32.440
- Nah.

44:32.440 --> 44:34.413
He's unconscious, shot in the belly.

44:35.420 --> 44:37.670
He'll bleed to death
before he even wakes up.

44:38.610 --> 44:40.910
Shooting him at this
point is a mercy killing.

44:45.060 --> 44:48.259
- I don't think the bullet
even went that far in.

44:48.259 --> 44:50.463
It feels like it bounced
off a rib or something.

44:52.090 --> 44:54.630
- This one's gonna bounce
off the back of his skull.

44:54.630 --> 44:55.940
Get the hell out of the way!

44:55.940 --> 44:56.773
- No!

44:58.743 --> 44:59.576
- All right.

45:00.420 --> 45:02.200
You stay here and watch him die.

45:09.615 --> 45:12.032
(man coughs)

45:18.741 --> 45:21.408
(ominous music)

46:29.757 --> 46:31.958
- Inform Command we
have located the source

46:31.958 --> 46:33.176
of the disturbance.

46:33.176 --> 46:34.509
- Sir, yes, sir.

46:36.405 --> 46:39.405
(tense synth music)

47:15.038 --> 47:20.038
(guns firing)
(Travis yells)

47:35.404 --> 47:38.487
(grenades exploding)

47:53.257 --> 47:55.570
- [Merle] Did you really
think you could kill us all?

47:55.570 --> 47:57.513
- [Travis] No, just you.

47:59.520 --> 48:00.370
- [Merle] Get up.

48:03.950 --> 48:04.783
- What?

48:07.289 --> 48:08.839
You gonna shoot me in the back?

48:10.470 --> 48:15.203
- Those tribals, they come
to this place to sacrifice.

48:17.000 --> 48:19.783
It's surrounded by some
kind of energy field.

48:22.980 --> 48:25.173
The skulls serve as a warning.

48:26.970 --> 48:29.073
They worship what lies beyond.

48:31.150 --> 48:32.809
Now start walking.

48:32.809 --> 48:35.309
(tense music)

49:29.872 --> 49:32.622
(haunting music)

50:28.350 --> 50:29.803
- Your fire's almost out.

50:31.240 --> 50:33.370
Maybe I should just stand here

50:33.370 --> 50:35.150
and watch you freeze to death,

50:35.150 --> 50:37.433
take my compass off your dead body.

50:38.520 --> 50:40.403
But I felt inclined to say hello.

50:42.980 --> 50:43.813
- Hello.

50:44.670 --> 50:46.670
- You have something that belongs to me.

50:51.950 --> 50:53.140
- What's going on?

50:53.140 --> 50:55.820
- I don't associate with his kind.

50:55.820 --> 50:58.660
I best be leaving before I start shooting.

50:58.660 --> 51:00.083
- No, don't go!

51:01.860 --> 51:03.990
They kidnapped him three months ago

51:03.990 --> 51:05.800
and made him ride with them.

51:05.800 --> 51:09.653
He's just as much a
victim in this as anyone.

51:09.653 --> 51:13.990
- And how do I know he
didn't cook up some story

51:13.990 --> 51:15.920
to save his ass?

51:15.920 --> 51:18.540
I don't feel inclined to
sleep next to you either.

51:18.540 --> 51:20.640
Who knows what you'll take from me next?

51:20.640 --> 51:23.150
- I only took it so you'd come back.

51:23.150 --> 51:25.693
- You chose to stay with him!

51:26.530 --> 51:28.430
You chose to stay here and die,

51:28.430 --> 51:30.243
don't put that bang on me!

51:31.100 --> 51:33.690
- You could save me from my ignorance,

51:33.690 --> 51:35.940
if you were the gentlemanly sort.

51:35.940 --> 51:38.590
- Good thing I'm not thusly
inflicted then, isn't it?

51:43.040 --> 51:45.171
So is he dying or what?

51:45.171 --> 51:46.192
- I mean the bleeding stopped,

51:46.192 --> 51:49.030
but I don't know.

51:49.030 --> 51:51.240
- Well, how about it, you son of a bitch!

51:51.240 --> 51:53.000
- Don't shoot, don't shoot!

51:53.000 --> 51:54.233
Please, don't shoot.

51:55.960 --> 51:57.410
Don't shoot.

51:57.410 --> 51:59.560
- He's not one of them, you know.

51:59.560 --> 52:00.993
Those men you're after.

52:02.260 --> 52:03.890
- It's true.

52:03.890 --> 52:04.723
It's true, sir.

52:07.150 --> 52:07.983
I'm not.

52:09.804 --> 52:12.503
A couple months ago they
got my brother and I.

52:14.782 --> 52:15.832
They killed my folks.

52:17.480 --> 52:21.060
Took all the supplies they
needed, burn everything else.

52:21.060 --> 52:23.263
- So why didn't they kill you, Cat Meat?

52:25.182 --> 52:28.413
- The head guy, Ramses,
he's after something.

52:29.870 --> 52:32.803
Well, he told us we could be soldiers.

52:33.852 --> 52:34.952
He said he'd train us.

52:36.222 --> 52:37.822
It's awful what they made us do.

52:38.820 --> 52:42.273
Ramses tried to make my
brother and I kill each other.

52:43.900 --> 52:47.563
Said one would die, the
other would get to eat.

52:48.560 --> 52:49.393
And...

52:51.482 --> 52:52.682
That night my brother...

52:58.500 --> 52:59.550
- So, you killed him.

53:01.910 --> 53:03.550
- See?

53:03.550 --> 53:05.500
You're not the only one in some sorrow.

53:08.350 --> 53:10.330
You shot the poor kid.

53:10.330 --> 53:11.710
- Yeah, and I might shoot him some more

53:11.710 --> 53:13.873
if I don't like what he has to tell me.

53:13.873 --> 53:16.040
I might shoot you too.

53:16.040 --> 53:18.040
Save me a world of trouble.

53:18.040 --> 53:18.963
- I ran away.

53:19.860 --> 53:21.580
They didn't even bother following me.

53:21.580 --> 53:23.483
- Why do you suppose that is?

53:24.502 --> 53:26.952
- I'm not really sure,
Ramses is after something.

53:28.740 --> 53:31.720
I don't even think he
knows what it is himself.

53:31.720 --> 53:33.600
Something kinda out of the ordinary.

53:33.600 --> 53:38.600
Something supernatural, kinda godly.

53:38.660 --> 53:41.240
Heard guys around camp talking about it.

53:41.240 --> 53:42.970
Talking about when you get near,

53:42.970 --> 53:45.350
they kinda go a little bit crazy.

53:45.350 --> 53:47.510
Kinda lose their mind a little bit.

53:47.510 --> 53:50.263
Shooting at men out of the wilderness,

53:51.700 --> 53:53.693
and just disappear, no bodies.

53:54.770 --> 53:56.413
- We head that way tomorrow.

54:03.905 --> 54:08.405
I don't like the fact I'm
being followed by these two.

54:13.146 --> 54:16.840
I should let them fall
asleep and gut them both,

54:16.840 --> 54:18.347
save some heartache.

54:27.730 --> 54:29.023
But I have to admit,

54:30.250 --> 54:32.453
it's not all bad seeing another face.

54:34.120 --> 54:34.980
- Stop, just...

54:37.708 --> 54:39.500
Just wait a minute.

54:39.500 --> 54:42.830
- [Travis] Even if it is
a sad excuse for a woman

54:42.830 --> 54:45.260
and a piss poor soldier.

54:45.260 --> 54:48.533
These are cold-blooded,
battle hardened soldiers.

54:50.490 --> 54:52.713
My current company won't stand a chance.

54:55.840 --> 54:58.340
(tense music)

55:06.868 --> 55:09.201
(gun fires)

55:15.378 --> 55:16.720
- [Cat Lady] Who the
hell is shooting at us?

55:16.720 --> 55:17.603
- Stay down.

55:22.587 --> 55:25.347
(gun fires)

55:25.347 --> 55:27.847
(tense music)

55:35.674 --> 55:36.757
Drop the gun!

55:43.050 --> 55:44.040
- Is he...

55:44.040 --> 55:46.280
- No, it went behind him.

55:46.280 --> 55:47.113
He fainted.

55:49.340 --> 55:50.580
- Hey.

55:50.580 --> 55:53.300
I don't really appreciate being shot at.

55:53.300 --> 55:55.343
- Of course I was shooting at you.

55:55.343 --> 55:56.360
You take a man's livelihood

55:56.360 --> 55:58.380
and then come back to finish the job?

55:58.380 --> 56:02.220
Well, do it if you're
gonna do it, you cowards!

56:02.220 --> 56:04.440
- What is he blabbering about?

56:04.440 --> 56:05.453
- Hard to say.

56:06.630 --> 56:07.663
Give him some space.

56:10.450 --> 56:11.283
Now...

56:12.930 --> 56:15.790
Why don't you tell me what the
hell you were talking about

56:15.790 --> 56:17.980
and I'll decide whether
or not I'll shoot you.

56:17.980 --> 56:19.763
- Him and his buddies.

56:20.950 --> 56:25.380
Some sort of soldiers come
across me and my wagon.

56:25.380 --> 56:27.230
I got away, but they took everything,

56:28.290 --> 56:31.153
except my gun, and now I'm
damn near out of ammunition.

56:32.500 --> 56:34.110
- You're more likely to
hit what you were aiming at

56:34.110 --> 56:35.483
if you use it as a club.

56:36.490 --> 56:37.793
How long ago was this?

56:39.240 --> 56:40.140
- Ask your friend.

56:43.200 --> 56:44.450
- I'm asking you, friend.

56:47.050 --> 56:49.400
Better start talking
before I lose my patience.

56:53.640 --> 56:55.832
- A few days ago one of them said

56:55.832 --> 56:58.010
they was gonna come back and, well,

56:58.010 --> 57:00.130
I saw that uniform and
figured you'd just come back

57:00.130 --> 57:01.193
to finish me off.

57:02.490 --> 57:04.703
- That uniform does attract gunfire.

57:07.410 --> 57:10.900
I can assure you he
wasn't amongst those men

57:10.900 --> 57:11.733
that you speak of.

57:11.733 --> 57:15.120
- Well, if you think that
makes me feel any better,

57:15.120 --> 57:17.650
you, sir, are sorely mistaken.

57:17.650 --> 57:19.403
You desert bandits are all alike.

57:21.230 --> 57:23.330
You can take my gun, I ain't got any food.

57:25.390 --> 57:28.053
- No, you seem miserable enough as it is.

57:29.282 --> 57:31.450
I'm gonna keep the gun for a while though

57:31.450 --> 57:32.550
before I give it back.

57:36.150 --> 57:37.850
I guess we make camp here tonight.

57:39.128 --> 57:41.593
I'll see what I can do
about hunting some food.

57:52.110 --> 57:54.070
- What are we gonna do
about the old timer?

57:54.070 --> 57:57.070
- Well, I figure let him run his mouth

57:57.070 --> 57:58.817
for a minute or two more,

57:58.817 --> 58:00.313
then I'll shoot him.

58:01.840 --> 58:03.340
Even though I said I wouldn't.

58:05.307 --> 58:07.107
Get that fire started, I'll be back.

58:21.150 --> 58:23.263
- I haven't sorted this all out myself.

58:24.640 --> 58:25.490
But maybe...

58:28.180 --> 58:31.631
Maybe a power, maybe someone or something

58:31.631 --> 58:34.580
greater than man keeps an eye

58:34.580 --> 58:39.060
when we become too
destructive or too powerful.

58:39.060 --> 58:41.950
Steps in and stomps us down to nothing,

58:41.950 --> 58:46.667
and leaves a few of us
to rebuild and forget.

58:49.010 --> 58:50.263
- That's nonsense.

58:51.440 --> 58:53.440
- You believe what you want.

58:53.440 --> 58:54.583
That's what I heard.

58:55.440 --> 58:58.150
And that doesn't sit with me well either,

58:58.150 --> 58:59.930
but there's something
else happening here now,

58:59.930 --> 59:00.763
that's for sure.

59:00.763 --> 59:05.640
- So, all of this, because of a tall tale?

59:06.860 --> 59:09.210
- Now, I know this area
wasn't heavily populated,

59:09.210 --> 59:12.073
but there were cities
and there were towns.

59:12.940 --> 59:15.010
And they're gone, just gone.

59:15.010 --> 59:18.740
Even the big cities after
the riots and the fires,

59:18.740 --> 59:20.540
there was evidence of some settlements,

59:20.540 --> 59:21.490
but they are gone.

59:21.490 --> 59:24.250
It's like they never
existed in the first place.

59:24.250 --> 59:27.360
I mean, there are very few people left.

59:27.360 --> 59:30.640
And maybe a power that is greater than man

59:32.010 --> 59:34.883
is cleansing the earth of evil.

59:35.830 --> 59:38.593
- I think we found ourselves
a true believer this time.

59:40.320 --> 59:42.560
You gonna add this one
to your collection too?

59:42.560 --> 59:44.540
- I want to hear what he has to say.

59:44.540 --> 59:46.680
- Yeah, of course you do.

59:46.680 --> 59:48.279
You're insane too.

59:48.279 --> 59:49.112
- Ugh!

59:50.800 --> 59:52.862
- I like an appreciative audience.

59:52.862 --> 59:54.952
(Cat Lady chuckles)

59:54.952 --> 59:57.869
(soldier whistles)

1:00:03.312 --> 1:00:06.812
(Old Man plays harmonica)

1:00:09.535 --> 1:00:10.618
- Aw, Christ.

1:00:21.216 --> 1:00:23.883
(calming music)

1:00:45.649 --> 1:00:47.066
- She was pretty.

1:00:55.570 --> 1:00:59.115
You act like you're the only
one that's lost something.

1:00:59.115 --> 1:01:00.965
Me and that soldier, who have we got?

1:01:03.740 --> 1:01:04.840
You've heard the stories.

1:01:04.840 --> 1:01:07.400
You know if you go marching
out there after your brother,

1:01:07.400 --> 1:01:08.823
you're not coming back.

1:01:10.280 --> 1:01:12.400
And what's it gonna do if you do kill him?

1:01:12.400 --> 1:01:14.003
It's not gonna change anything.

1:01:14.940 --> 1:01:18.533
You've got a chance here
to do something good,

1:01:18.533 --> 1:01:19.890
or we can go with the old timer

1:01:19.890 --> 1:01:23.050
and find one of those towns
he's been talking about.

1:01:23.050 --> 1:01:24.890
We can all help each other out.

1:01:24.890 --> 1:01:26.560
We can start over.

1:01:30.350 --> 1:01:34.257
- There was a time that
would've been a real good offer.

1:01:40.350 --> 1:01:41.200
And you're right.

1:01:43.840 --> 1:01:46.783
There is no need for you or
that boy to come with me.

1:01:47.992 --> 1:01:49.592
- But what would your wife want?

1:01:59.380 --> 1:02:02.253
- [Travis] The old man was
nuts, no doubt about that.

1:02:03.770 --> 1:02:06.420
But he seemed the best and
only choice for those two.

1:02:07.835 --> 1:02:11.110
He could get them to one of
those towns he spoke about.

1:02:11.110 --> 1:02:14.080
Lead them away from whatever awaits me

1:02:14.080 --> 1:02:15.153
over that ridge.

1:02:24.239 --> 1:02:27.239
(tense synth music)

1:02:53.480 --> 1:02:55.813
(gun fires)

1:03:02.924 --> 1:03:04.774
They were shooting in all directions.

1:03:06.920 --> 1:03:10.083
Whoever hit these men
had the numbers to do it.

1:03:12.780 --> 1:03:14.213
More ghosts in the desert.

1:03:15.975 --> 1:03:18.975
(tense synth music)

1:03:28.210 --> 1:03:29.760
Is there anybody here with you?

1:03:35.410 --> 1:03:37.827
Where's the rest of your men?

1:03:40.133 --> 1:03:41.683
What the hell's wrong with you?

1:03:42.605 --> 1:03:43.522
Look at me!

1:03:46.101 --> 1:03:47.018
Look at me!

1:03:48.090 --> 1:03:50.890
- Holster your weapon, soldier.

1:03:50.890 --> 1:03:52.057
Nice and slow.

1:03:57.040 --> 1:03:57.973
Take a walk, move.

1:04:12.533 --> 1:04:15.616
On your knees nice and slow, soldier.

1:04:28.270 --> 1:04:31.493
So, you and I, we're
gonna finish the mission.

1:04:33.010 --> 1:04:34.693
Our men didn't die for no reason.

1:04:36.940 --> 1:04:40.563
Him over there, he's been
like that for three days.

1:04:42.100 --> 1:04:43.800
It's like they're all gone inside.

1:04:45.160 --> 1:04:47.680
And I'm sure by now you realize

1:04:47.680 --> 1:04:49.953
that things are a little
bit different around here.

1:04:51.130 --> 1:04:53.943
He hasn't talked, hasn't eaten,

1:04:55.140 --> 1:04:57.210
everything starts to seem different.

1:04:57.210 --> 1:04:59.310
He hasn't even taken his fuckin' mask off.

1:05:03.920 --> 1:05:05.053
Closer we got to it,

1:05:06.061 --> 1:05:08.011
the more they all started acting crazy.

1:05:10.050 --> 1:05:10.883
Even the men on...

1:05:10.883 --> 1:05:13.216
(gun fires)

1:05:24.630 --> 1:05:27.880
(dramatic synth music)

1:05:49.131 --> 1:05:53.214
(man speaks in foreign language)

1:08:42.792 --> 1:08:45.292
(eerie music)

1:09:40.511 --> 1:09:42.928
(man grunts)

1:09:54.893 --> 1:09:56.813
- Are you fuckin' crazy now?

1:09:57.992 --> 1:09:59.430
- I don't know.

1:09:59.430 --> 1:10:00.263
Maybe.

1:10:00.263 --> 1:10:02.309
- You've got that shit in your head.

1:10:02.309 --> 1:10:03.540
You're losing it just like the others,

1:10:03.540 --> 1:10:04.763
you almost killed me!

1:10:07.156 --> 1:10:08.793
- That wouldn't be the first time.

1:10:11.107 --> 1:10:12.950
Where did you come from anyway?

1:10:12.950 --> 1:10:15.464
- I've been following you
for the last few days.

1:10:15.464 --> 1:10:17.273
- You should've stayed with the old man.

1:10:19.487 --> 1:10:20.590
Give me my gun.

1:10:20.590 --> 1:10:22.840
- No, I think I'll hold
on to it for a while.

1:10:23.884 --> 1:10:24.717
- No.

1:10:24.717 --> 1:10:25.880
(gun fires)

1:10:25.880 --> 1:10:27.733
I only have three bullets left.

1:10:29.276 --> 1:10:31.340
What the hell do you
want with my gun anyway?

1:10:31.340 --> 1:10:32.820
- Why do you think I'd blindly follow

1:10:32.820 --> 1:10:35.727
the same son of a bitch who
put a bullet into my side?

1:10:35.727 --> 1:10:38.900
- I don't know.

1:10:38.900 --> 1:10:40.643
Maybe you're touched in the head.

1:10:40.643 --> 1:10:42.139
- You act like you're the only one

1:10:42.139 --> 1:10:43.910
that's got something to fight for.

1:10:43.910 --> 1:10:45.540
I'm going after Ramses.

1:10:45.540 --> 1:10:47.653
I'm going with or without you.

1:10:49.077 --> 1:10:51.410
- Are you sure that's a wise idea?

1:10:51.410 --> 1:10:52.933
You know what I'm up against.

1:10:53.880 --> 1:10:54.969
- They killed my brother,

1:10:54.969 --> 1:10:56.452
they killed my whole family.

1:10:57.910 --> 1:10:59.380
I'm going.

1:10:59.380 --> 1:11:00.213
- All right.

1:11:01.059 --> 1:11:02.743
Stop pointing that thing at me.

1:11:09.537 --> 1:11:12.537
(tense synth music)

1:11:25.430 --> 1:11:26.263
Get down.

1:11:29.320 --> 1:11:30.870
I saw some movement over there.

1:11:33.180 --> 1:11:34.270
No, no, no.

1:11:34.270 --> 1:11:35.320
Leave that holstered.

1:11:38.630 --> 1:11:40.080
They have a perimeter set up.

1:11:41.330 --> 1:11:43.350
They hear those gunshots,

1:11:43.350 --> 1:11:45.103
the whole lot will be after us.

1:11:49.498 --> 1:11:50.957
We could do this by hand.

1:11:52.860 --> 1:11:53.693
Move fast.

1:11:55.020 --> 1:11:55.853
Silent.

1:11:57.041 --> 1:11:59.541
(tense music)

1:12:05.570 --> 1:12:06.403
- Maybe two men.

1:12:14.862 --> 1:12:17.446
(men groaning)

1:12:18.314 --> 1:12:20.639
(gun fires)

1:12:20.639 --> 1:12:23.389
(dramatic music)

1:12:30.448 --> 1:12:32.948
(guns firing)

1:13:13.842 --> 1:13:14.702
- [Travis] We gotta go!

1:13:14.702 --> 1:13:15.937
Go now!

1:13:15.937 --> 1:13:16.770
- Hoorah!

1:13:19.880 --> 1:13:22.380
(guns firing)

1:13:27.839 --> 1:13:30.422
(Travis yells)

1:14:01.965 --> 1:14:04.465
(eerie music)

1:14:23.868 --> 1:14:26.535
(Travis groans)

1:14:53.145 --> 1:14:54.110
- What the hell are you doing out here

1:14:54.110 --> 1:14:55.673
in the middle of hell anyway?

1:14:57.340 --> 1:14:59.773
- Something's in the mouth of this canyon.

1:15:04.260 --> 1:15:06.063
Something that changes you.

1:15:07.750 --> 1:15:09.112
Gets inside your mind.

1:15:10.177 --> 1:15:12.850
And I think you know
what I'm talking about.

1:15:12.850 --> 1:15:14.093
You've seen it too.

1:15:15.020 --> 1:15:17.660
It drove some of the men mad.

1:15:17.660 --> 1:15:19.173
I'm not sure what it is.

1:15:20.070 --> 1:15:23.110
But I know it's connected to
those crazy sons of bitches

1:15:23.110 --> 1:15:25.770
that managed to take out most of my men.

1:15:25.770 --> 1:15:28.452
They seem to be protecting
whatever's out there,

1:15:29.430 --> 1:15:31.483
and their numbers are growing.

1:15:32.389 --> 1:15:34.922
You can't seem to kill 'em, can you?

1:15:34.922 --> 1:15:36.172
- I don't know.

1:15:37.183 --> 1:15:39.313
I really didn't try that hard.

1:15:42.005 --> 1:15:43.639
- Well, I did.

1:15:43.639 --> 1:15:46.170
They've all mutated somehow.

1:15:46.170 --> 1:15:49.020
They act more like animals than people.

1:15:49.020 --> 1:15:52.030
We found one of the bodies
after they attacked.

1:15:52.030 --> 1:15:54.059
It was horribly disfigured.

1:15:54.059 --> 1:15:57.570
He was one of the Sons, a captain no less.

1:15:57.570 --> 1:16:00.400
He must've discovered something out there,

1:16:00.400 --> 1:16:01.969
or built some kind of weapon.

1:16:01.969 --> 1:16:03.570
- I don't care what's out there.

1:16:04.540 --> 1:16:07.013
You've been crazy long before all this.

1:16:07.860 --> 1:16:09.920
So what exactly do you
have to gain from it?

1:16:09.920 --> 1:16:11.870
- Some of the brains back home,

1:16:15.639 --> 1:16:18.253
they think this could be
a source of real power.

1:16:20.570 --> 1:16:22.270
Power that could change the world.

1:16:23.270 --> 1:16:24.103
- Oh, really?

1:16:25.160 --> 1:16:27.020
Well, what is it then?

1:16:27.020 --> 1:16:28.452
- No one's seen it yet.

1:16:29.389 --> 1:16:31.063
No one's been close enough.

1:16:35.771 --> 1:16:38.771
But it is powerful, that's for sure.

1:16:41.309 --> 1:16:42.713
Man gets ahold of that,

1:16:44.710 --> 1:16:47.097
he could be the next ruler of the world.

1:16:50.360 --> 1:16:53.010
- And I'll make sure you're
dead before that happens.

1:16:58.020 --> 1:17:00.460
- You were so pathetic,

1:17:00.460 --> 1:17:03.010
calling her like you were.

1:17:03.010 --> 1:17:05.350
Like some maimed animal

1:17:05.350 --> 1:17:07.153
needing to be put down.

1:17:08.270 --> 1:17:10.233
So I did what I had to do,

1:17:11.322 --> 1:17:13.013
and I bashed your brains in.

1:17:14.040 --> 1:17:15.532
Looks like my blow was light.

1:17:18.460 --> 1:17:20.677
Must've been because
you're family and all.

1:17:23.504 --> 1:17:25.704
- And I'll see you dead
before this is over.

1:17:27.520 --> 1:17:28.719
- I think you could try.

1:17:32.730 --> 1:17:35.450
- You will pay for what you did, Merle.

1:17:35.450 --> 1:17:37.200
- Now you've come here for revenge?

1:17:41.280 --> 1:17:43.130
I don't think that's why you're here.

1:17:46.900 --> 1:17:49.000
I think you're here for me to put a bullet

1:17:50.416 --> 1:17:51.963
right between your eyes.

1:17:54.280 --> 1:17:55.362
How about it?

1:17:57.380 --> 1:17:59.693
Just a squeeze of the trigger,

1:18:00.880 --> 1:18:04.253
and then you get to see your family again.

1:18:08.653 --> 1:18:11.240
Isn't that what you want?

1:18:11.240 --> 1:18:13.898
- If you're gonna shoot me,

1:18:13.898 --> 1:18:15.150
then get it over with!

1:18:19.905 --> 1:18:21.987
- You don't deserve that.

1:18:23.639 --> 1:18:25.800
You don't deserve anything.

1:18:37.499 --> 1:18:40.499
(tense synth music)

1:18:49.466 --> 1:18:51.966
(guns firing)

1:19:09.446 --> 1:19:10.779
- What the hell?

1:19:12.884 --> 1:19:13.928
What's all that gunfire?

1:19:13.928 --> 1:19:15.530
- Come on, we've gotta get out of here.

1:19:15.530 --> 1:19:16.980
Someone's attacking the camp.

1:19:18.585 --> 1:19:21.085
(guns firing)

1:20:30.138 --> 1:20:32.721
(Travis yells)

1:20:35.849 --> 1:20:38.349
(guns firing)

1:20:54.603 --> 1:20:55.889
- I saw your brother slipping off

1:20:55.889 --> 1:20:57.340
when the savages attacked us.

1:20:58.824 --> 1:21:00.180
Me and the kid tried to tail him.

1:21:00.180 --> 1:21:01.200
- Which way did he go?

1:21:01.200 --> 1:21:02.170
- He went up over that ridge,

1:21:02.170 --> 1:21:04.753
right between those rocks, right there.

1:21:04.753 --> 1:21:07.253
(guns firing)

1:21:16.976 --> 1:21:19.660
- [Travis] I need you guys to go.

1:21:19.660 --> 1:21:21.809
- He's out there by himself
with these things chasing him.

1:21:21.809 --> 1:21:23.090
Let him find his own end.

1:21:23.090 --> 1:21:24.490
- You don't know my brother.

1:21:25.591 --> 1:21:26.710
This is something I've gotta do.

1:21:26.710 --> 1:21:28.700
- You've got nothing left to prove.

1:21:28.700 --> 1:21:30.160
He's as good as dead anyway.

1:21:30.160 --> 1:21:31.463
- I need you guys to go.

1:21:32.332 --> 1:21:33.360
Now!

1:21:33.360 --> 1:21:34.520
- No.

1:21:34.520 --> 1:21:35.530
That's the way Ramses went,

1:21:35.530 --> 1:21:38.013
that's the way I'm going
whether you like it or not.

1:21:39.000 --> 1:21:40.500
- I tried to keep him safe.

1:21:40.500 --> 1:21:41.480
I tried to lead him out of here

1:21:41.480 --> 1:21:43.000
and keep him safe just like you said.

1:21:43.000 --> 1:21:44.780
- No, I know you did.

1:21:44.780 --> 1:21:46.445
I'll see you guys soon.

1:21:46.445 --> 1:21:47.891
Now go, go!

1:21:47.891 --> 1:21:50.391
(guns firing)

1:21:57.148 --> 1:21:58.315
It's his hide.

1:21:59.414 --> 1:22:01.914
(guns firing)

1:23:19.471 --> 1:23:20.304
- Ramses!

1:23:26.496 --> 1:23:28.996
(guns firing)

1:23:34.639 --> 1:23:36.844
(Travis yells)

1:23:36.844 --> 1:23:39.344
(tense music)

1:23:47.178 --> 1:23:49.678
(guns firing)

1:24:08.937 --> 1:24:10.943
- You dumb son of a bitch.

1:24:12.639 --> 1:24:13.990
Why didn't you wait for me?

1:24:23.588 --> 1:24:25.500
Come, you need to rest.

1:24:25.500 --> 1:24:27.340
I'm gonna get you out of here.

1:24:27.340 --> 1:24:29.228
Maybe that old timer can fix you up.

1:24:29.228 --> 1:24:31.978
(soldier grunts)

1:24:36.996 --> 1:24:37.829
- Get him.

1:24:39.973 --> 1:24:41.139
You have to...

1:24:42.343 --> 1:24:43.343
You have to.

1:24:52.327 --> 1:24:54.827
(guns firing)

1:25:03.882 --> 1:25:06.632
(dramatic music)

1:26:47.469 --> 1:26:50.052
(Travis yells)

1:27:25.879 --> 1:27:28.462
(men grunting)

1:28:20.362 --> 1:28:23.279
(mysterious music)

1:29:21.286 --> 1:29:22.119
- Hey!

1:29:23.252 --> 1:29:25.752
(tense music)

1:30:01.850 --> 1:30:02.693
It's over.

1:30:04.550 --> 1:30:08.173
- The anomaly is just over that rise.

1:30:10.620 --> 1:30:15.620
Finish me off, and all
that power is yours.

1:30:16.639 --> 1:30:18.600
- Not much has been on my mind

1:30:19.889 --> 1:30:22.333
except ending your worthless existence.

1:30:25.570 --> 1:30:27.202
I'm done with revenge.

1:30:29.290 --> 1:30:31.243
You're not worth the extra ammo.

1:30:33.380 --> 1:30:34.862
You lose any more blood,

1:30:36.100 --> 1:30:38.620
there ain't nothing on this earth

1:30:38.620 --> 1:30:41.683
or anywhere else that'll bring you back.

1:30:43.210 --> 1:30:44.540
- You mean to tell me

1:30:46.900 --> 1:30:49.930
you're not just a slightly bit interested

1:30:53.430 --> 1:30:54.733
what's over that ridge?

1:30:57.693 --> 1:31:00.850
I sacrificed everything to get here.

1:31:04.280 --> 1:31:06.690
It's only 50 yards.

1:31:06.690 --> 1:31:08.763
You could change things in this world.

1:31:10.580 --> 1:31:11.793
Make a difference.

1:31:13.270 --> 1:31:15.270
- There's some things better left alone.

1:31:17.040 --> 1:31:19.083
That's something you never understood.

1:31:21.090 --> 1:31:23.143
You ain't gonna hurt anybody else,

1:31:24.035 --> 1:31:25.285
and neither are your men.

1:31:26.332 --> 1:31:28.232
- You're just gonna leave me out here?

1:31:30.139 --> 1:31:34.513
Not even give yourself the
satisfaction of revenge?

1:31:36.440 --> 1:31:37.273
- Yeah.

1:31:39.550 --> 1:31:40.413
I reckon so.

1:31:42.469 --> 1:31:45.719
(dramatic synth music)

1:33:13.209 --> 1:33:15.876
(ominous music)
